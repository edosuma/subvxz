00:00.018 --> 00:01.683
Previously on Pitch...

00:01.771 --> 00:03.270
The video is everywhere.

00:03.280 --> 00:04.753
I just don't want to do it anymore.

00:04.763 --> 00:06.036
I just don't... I don't want to, like...

00:06.046 --> 00:07.531
I don't want to take secret exits,

00:07.600 --> 00:09.576
I don't want to smile when
I don't want to smile.

00:09.586 --> 00:11.635
We've heard all the
excuses over the years.

00:11.704 --> 00:15.005
- Really, I'm fine.
- No, you're not.

00:15.372 --> 00:19.098
You and I, what we're doing,
it might have cost us the game today.

00:19.108 --> 00:21.520
- You don't want to do this anymore?
- No, that's not what I'm saying, Amelia.

00:21.530 --> 00:24.348
Okay, then I'll say it. You know,
your head wasn't really in it, anyway.

00:24.416 --> 00:26.950
I figured you weren't dating
anybody else seriously,

00:27.019 --> 00:28.886
because you weren't over Rachel yet.

00:28.954 --> 00:30.254
I'm still in love with you.

00:30.289 --> 00:32.322
You only want me because
you can't have me.

00:32.391 --> 00:34.858
I got hacked. Selfies that
we took from the road.

00:34.927 --> 00:37.694
The selfies hacked from Trevor's
computer have surfaced.

00:37.763 --> 00:40.297
- Pictures are being released.
- What else you got?

00:40.366 --> 00:42.832
I can give you a home.
And I promise you,

00:42.920 --> 00:45.035
that San Diego will embrace
you as one of their own.

00:45.104 --> 00:46.703
I'm not sitting behind Mike Lawson.

00:46.772 --> 00:49.640
Duarte is a catcher,
he's coming to your team.

00:49.742 --> 00:51.675
That guy's not taking my job.

00:53.000 --> 00:59.074

01:38.899 --> 01:41.487
I thought Skip was giving you
the day off behind the plate.

01:41.497 --> 01:42.830
He is.

01:43.347 --> 01:45.877
I got screaming kids at home.

01:45.887 --> 01:48.050
I got an excuse to be here early.

01:48.511 --> 01:51.019
Kiki's working on my back.

02:03.400 --> 02:06.150
You look like a waitress at Hooters.

02:07.986 --> 02:10.817
I mean, I'm amazed that your head
is the only thing that bobbles.

02:10.886 --> 02:13.050
The front office should
be throwing a fit.

02:13.060 --> 02:14.688
Amelia, nude photos of the real me

02:14.756 --> 02:16.256
are about to explode
all over the Internet.

02:16.324 --> 02:17.774
I need to know what we're
gonna do to stop it.

02:17.784 --> 02:19.159
We can't stop it.

02:19.227 --> 02:21.164
I've got three law firms on this.

02:21.174 --> 02:23.402
We can keep it out of the
tabloids, but there's no way

02:23.412 --> 02:25.331
that we can keep them from
the underground Web sites.

02:25.434 --> 02:26.820
They're already teasing them.

02:26.830 --> 02:30.637
Eliot says that we've got four,
I mean, five days tops.

02:31.105 --> 02:33.707
So much for being "one of the guys."

02:33.809 --> 02:36.142
So much for being a role
model to little girls.

02:36.211 --> 02:38.055
I've handled this kind of thing before.

02:38.065 --> 02:41.548
Yeah, for bobble-headed actresses
who see nudity as a career move.

02:41.558 --> 02:44.784
I'm just saying that...

02:45.186 --> 02:48.655
we have to be tactically
creative about this.

02:48.757 --> 02:50.164
"Tactically creative"?

02:50.174 --> 02:52.596
Yeah, our strongest move is deniability.

02:52.606 --> 02:55.662
It's us being able to
prove that it's not you.

02:55.731 --> 02:57.115
- It is me.
- Right.

02:57.125 --> 02:59.225
So some might fabricate a mole.

02:59.294 --> 03:01.260
Say-say on your left hip.

03:01.329 --> 03:02.806
Have it appear in training photos...

03:02.816 --> 03:05.331
Wait, you-you want me to change
my body to support a lie?

03:05.366 --> 03:07.033
Are you kidding me? Never.

03:07.135 --> 03:09.268
You wouldn't, would you?

03:09.337 --> 03:11.308
You shouldn't. Good for you.

03:12.356 --> 03:16.619
I need you to come up with something
better. So I can focus on my job.

03:18.413 --> 03:20.246
I have to go tell the front office.

03:21.543 --> 03:23.197
They're already upset with me after L.A.

03:23.207 --> 03:25.551
I know. They need to know.

03:26.348 --> 03:28.821
They need to know today.

03:35.096 --> 03:37.129
Hey, it's too bad about you and Mike.

03:37.752 --> 03:41.204
I'm sorry if I was the
reason it didn't work out.

03:41.980 --> 03:44.970
Mike Lawson has some stuff
that he needs to work through.

03:45.039 --> 03:47.727
You pushed me out of the
way of a speeding bullet.

03:47.737 --> 03:49.687
Now it's my turn to help you.

03:51.575 --> 03:53.911
That was a hard no on
the fake mole, right?

03:53.921 --> 03:57.016
- Amelia.
- Good, smart. I was just testing.

04:24.791 --> 04:27.880
With your backup catcher down,
you know what that means, right?

04:27.982 --> 04:29.014
They're gonna bring up Livan.

04:29.083 --> 04:31.075
They're gonna bring up
Livan to back you up.

04:31.085 --> 04:32.818
- Hey, Mike...
- They're gonna bring up Livan

04:32.887 --> 04:34.787
and the minute you take a day off

04:34.856 --> 04:36.956
or you pull a hammy and
he gets the start...

04:37.024 --> 04:39.358
- If you say Wally Pipp...
- He's gonna Wally Pipp your ass.

04:39.427 --> 04:41.211
- Who's Wally Pipp?
- He's not Wally Pipping my ass.

04:41.221 --> 04:42.828
Yeah, well tell that to
the media and the fans

04:42.930 --> 04:44.864
when they start screaming
for Livan to start

04:44.932 --> 04:46.940
the first time you go 0 for four.

04:46.950 --> 04:49.568
Hey, Mike. Um, if you have a sec later,

04:49.604 --> 04:51.971
can I show you how my cutter's coming
along? I think I got something here.

04:51.981 --> 04:54.573
I just caught eight innings
on my day off. Love to.

04:54.642 --> 04:57.676
"Yankees first baseman, Lou Gehrig,
replaced starter, Wally Pipp,

04:57.745 --> 05:00.212
and played in 2,130 consecutive games."

05:00.281 --> 05:02.532
Hmm. That's Wally Pipp.

05:02.542 --> 05:04.016
How could you be a ballplayer

05:04.085 --> 05:06.552
and not know who Wally Pipp is?

05:06.621 --> 05:08.521
I was born in 1992?

05:08.623 --> 05:10.856
Try watching some Ken Burns.

05:10.925 --> 05:12.207
Mike.

05:12.471 --> 05:15.267
Oh, here it comes. Good luck, Wally.

05:17.390 --> 05:19.745
- You know what this means, right?
- You're calling up Livan.

05:19.755 --> 05:22.373
- He's on a flight already.
- Don't waste any time, do you?

05:22.383 --> 05:25.162
Well, El Paso had a game
in Vegas. Look, Mike,

05:25.264 --> 05:28.119
- I want you to play some first base.
- Sorry?

05:28.129 --> 05:30.994
Charlie and Oscar want to see what
Livan can do behind the dish,

05:31.004 --> 05:32.611
and I want both your bats in the lineup.

05:32.680 --> 05:34.415
- First base?
- Not every day.

05:34.425 --> 05:35.840
Remember spring training, Tucson?

05:35.917 --> 05:37.016
Two errors in one game?

05:37.084 --> 05:39.051
- Two errors in one play.
- Oh, thanks, Buck.

05:39.120 --> 05:40.686
Always good to have you
doing color commentary.

05:40.788 --> 05:42.888
Listen, Mike,
you're not a rookie anymore.

05:42.957 --> 05:45.350
This'll help prolong your career.

05:45.473 --> 05:49.094
Now in fairness to Lawson, this sounds
a lot like what you say to a guy

05:49.163 --> 05:51.763
when you're starting
to end their career.

05:54.164 --> 05:56.103
I got to hack a whiz.

05:56.350 --> 05:58.871
Buck, can you tell
Ginny to come in here?

05:58.973 --> 06:00.439
Yep.

06:00.804 --> 06:02.141
Team has to come first.

06:02.210 --> 06:04.410
And I'm the catcher on
the team. Ask anyone.

06:04.479 --> 06:07.778
- Better yet, try asking me.
- This is not a Wally Pipp thing.

06:07.788 --> 06:09.977
Think of it as a temporary move.

06:09.987 --> 06:12.066
Well, I'm not good with moves.

06:13.020 --> 06:14.920
Think of it as an adventure.

06:14.989 --> 06:17.662
Moving back to Poway.
Won't that be fun, Mikey?

06:17.672 --> 06:20.879
We just moved here.
You said we're never going back.

06:20.967 --> 06:22.843
Here's a fun game.

06:22.853 --> 06:25.524
Grab as much of your stuff as you can

06:25.534 --> 06:28.151
in five minutes,
and then we're out of here.

06:29.861 --> 06:31.237
What about the rest of our stuff?

06:31.305 --> 06:34.005
We'll buy new stuff.
Come on, it'll be fun.

06:41.616 --> 06:43.649
I don't know anyone here.

06:43.718 --> 06:46.919
Then you can be anyone you want.

06:48.300 --> 06:50.185
That's your new coach.

06:50.547 --> 06:53.599
He seemed real nice.
He'll look after you.

06:53.837 --> 06:55.794
Can I just come with you?

06:56.059 --> 06:59.805
You know the drill. New town...
Mom's got some job interviews.

06:59.815 --> 07:02.352
Didn't you want to play baseball again?

07:07.375 --> 07:09.475
This is Mike.

07:09.544 --> 07:11.010
He likes baseball.

07:12.388 --> 07:16.582
I might be a little late to pick
you up. I'll do my best, okay?

07:17.956 --> 07:19.856
Hey, Mike. I'm Dave Grissom.

07:21.251 --> 07:23.152
"Dave Grissom Motors."

07:23.162 --> 07:25.658
Dave Grissom Motors.

07:25.793 --> 07:27.293
That's right.

07:27.361 --> 07:29.716
Looks like you didn't bring any gear.

07:32.464 --> 07:34.967
Which is a good thing,
because I've got some for you.

07:35.036 --> 07:37.536
- Do you know the game?
- I want to play first base.

07:37.638 --> 07:39.770
- Mm.
- Like "Will the Thrill."

07:39.884 --> 07:41.574
Well...

07:41.642 --> 07:45.007
I think we might be able to
do even better than first.

07:47.174 --> 07:49.181
We're skipping your next start.

07:49.250 --> 07:50.316
What?

07:50.418 --> 07:52.885
- Two days off in ten days.
- What he means is,

07:52.954 --> 07:55.819
we have two days off
in the next ten days.

07:55.829 --> 07:58.301
You're our fifth starter.
That allows us to start

07:58.311 --> 08:00.458
our number one pitcher
against the Giants.

08:00.468 --> 08:01.911
I need to pitch.

08:01.921 --> 08:04.069
I've been working on
this cutter, it's ready.

08:04.079 --> 08:05.610
If this is about what happened in L.A...

08:05.620 --> 08:07.566
- It's not.
- I want to pitch.

08:07.635 --> 08:10.502
And I want abs like Bradley Cooper,
but it's not happening.

08:15.408 --> 08:17.258
Who's Bradley Cooper?

08:19.751 --> 08:22.990
- Hey. Everything okay?
- They're skipping my start.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.216
It makes sense. We got two days off in
ten days. Al can pitch Sonny twice.

08:26.226 --> 08:27.990
- I want to pitch.
- And I want to catch.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.816
It's not all about you, rookie.

08:30.731 --> 08:32.057
You're right.

08:32.126 --> 08:34.347
I'm actually glad I'm missing a
start if you're playing first base.

08:34.357 --> 08:36.629
I heard about spring training.

08:36.697 --> 08:38.397
Two errors on one play?

08:38.466 --> 08:39.932
Ball took a bad bounce,
should have been scored

08:40.001 --> 08:42.101
- a hit and an error.
- Mm-hmm.

08:44.149 --> 08:46.460
So you're working on a cutter, right?

08:46.470 --> 08:48.739
- Yeah, you want see it?
- No.

08:54.572 --> 08:56.615
Hey. If you're here
about the bobblehead,

08:56.625 --> 08:59.551
it's just the vendor's first pass,
just to get the conversation started.

08:59.620 --> 09:01.644
Felt like more of a
conversation ender to me.

09:01.654 --> 09:03.955
Yeah, you should have seen
their first crack at Lawson, it's like

09:03.965 --> 09:06.425
they dipped his head in pencil shavings.

09:06.460 --> 09:10.210
Nude photos of Ginny are about to
explode all over the Internet.

09:12.690 --> 09:14.667
- Huh?
- An ex of hers was hacked.

09:14.735 --> 09:17.394
He had selfies from years ago.

09:17.404 --> 09:19.338
It's about to break on a
bunch of rogue Web sites.

09:19.407 --> 09:21.414
No, no, no, no.
We can't let that happen.

09:21.424 --> 09:24.143
There's nothing we can do.
We can't even find the hacker.

09:24.211 --> 09:26.612
We've tried lawyers,
cyber-detectives, everything.

09:26.714 --> 09:28.313
Our job now is to manage it.

09:28.349 --> 09:29.982
Exactly how long have
you known about this?

09:30.051 --> 09:32.899
There was no point in telling you
until we knew that it was unstoppable.

09:32.909 --> 09:35.851
Yeah, right, no. Major League Baseball
doesn't have any lawyers or anything.

09:35.861 --> 09:38.691
Cease and desist orders against
Web sites that sell crack

09:38.759 --> 09:40.159
and Croatian wives?
Ain't gonna cut it, Oscar.

09:40.227 --> 09:41.493
Know what ain't gonna cut it?

09:41.562 --> 09:44.463
Is that stuff keeps happening
to your client and my player.

09:44.565 --> 09:46.691
Are there any other surprises
that I should know about?

09:46.701 --> 09:50.001
Because it'd be nice, for once,
to get in front of one.

09:51.363 --> 09:53.298
A whole generation of young
women look up to Ginny...

09:53.308 --> 09:55.641
A whole generation of boys
look up to male athletes

09:55.710 --> 09:58.016
with far worse on their phone,
and nobody gives a crap

09:58.026 --> 10:00.059
- about that, Oscar.
- You're right. It's unfair.

10:00.069 --> 10:02.139
Women are objectified in
ways that men aren't.

10:02.216 --> 10:04.007
But that's our reality,

10:04.076 --> 10:05.709
and this is gonna be a
disaster for all of us.

10:05.778 --> 10:08.554
Thank you for mansplaining that to me.

10:12.979 --> 10:15.067
Always wanted to use that word.

10:16.489 --> 10:18.756
- All right, so what's the plan?
- I'm working on it.

10:21.393 --> 10:24.161
We're not through talking about
these bobbleheads, either.

10:24.230 --> 10:26.130
I should be so lucky.

10:29.645 --> 10:31.865
Okay.

10:32.341 --> 10:33.591
You gonna stay in there all night?

10:33.601 --> 10:35.232
Just thaw me out before the next game.

10:35.242 --> 10:36.682
Five minutes in a microwave,
I should be fine.

10:36.751 --> 10:38.333
Hey, Mike, Sonny.

10:38.343 --> 10:40.109
I want you to meet Livan Duarte.

10:40.211 --> 10:43.713
As you know, he'll be catching
for us in San Francisco.

10:47.829 --> 10:49.719
Livan.

10:49.788 --> 10:52.522
I've heard you could
be one of the greats.

10:52.532 --> 10:53.766
Someday.

10:54.435 --> 10:56.684
I followed your career for a long time.

10:56.753 --> 10:58.597
My father was a fan.

11:01.724 --> 11:04.924
Sonny, why don't you show
Livan around the clubhouse?

11:09.595 --> 11:11.199
This season would be nice.

11:11.267 --> 11:12.875
Come on.

11:12.944 --> 11:15.494
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure was mine.

11:17.252 --> 11:19.882
Hey, I gave myself a handicap:
I'm in an ice bath.

11:19.892 --> 11:21.493
Thanks for greeting him like a juvenile.

11:21.503 --> 11:22.819
Thanks for giving me the head's up

11:22.887 --> 11:24.087
that you were signing
him in the first place.

11:24.122 --> 11:25.521
Listen, odds are,

11:25.557 --> 11:27.107
he's up here till Besser
comes off the DL.

11:27.117 --> 11:28.596
Oscar, he's here to take my job.

11:28.606 --> 11:30.149
You flew halfway across the
world to hand it to him.

11:30.218 --> 11:33.411
Oh, so now I have to apologize
for signing new players.

11:33.421 --> 11:35.721
What about the catcher you replaced?

11:37.250 --> 11:39.559
Livan's catching for
us in San Francisco,

11:39.872 --> 11:41.986
not full-time... yet.

11:42.729 --> 11:44.745
Don't make me speed up the timetable.

11:44.755 --> 11:46.129
By trading me?

11:46.139 --> 11:47.800
Relax. You have a no-trade clause.

11:47.902 --> 11:49.843
And yet, not relaxed.

11:49.853 --> 11:52.381
Well, it's a good thing
I run a business,

11:52.391 --> 11:53.791
and not a day spa.

12:05.441 --> 12:06.717
How'd it go with Oscar?

12:06.727 --> 12:09.046
Really good. He was
sympathetic and supportive,

12:09.056 --> 12:12.224
we're pooling our resources
and coming up with a plan.

12:12.292 --> 12:14.126
It went that bad?

12:14.228 --> 12:16.828
You just keep your head
down, like we said.

12:16.864 --> 12:18.497
Focus on pitching a great game...

12:18.565 --> 12:20.382
No, I'm not pitching at all,
not in San Francisco.

12:20.392 --> 12:22.134
They're skipping my start.

12:22.202 --> 12:23.835
Not after I talk to them they're not.

12:23.871 --> 12:25.499
No, Amelia, please, don't.

12:25.509 --> 12:28.073
Anyway, I tried. Al wouldn't have it.

12:28.690 --> 12:30.840
Ginny, I know this is hard for you.

12:31.139 --> 12:33.879
But I want you to know,
when I decided to take you on,

12:33.947 --> 12:36.815
I didn't do it because
I thought it was easy.

12:36.825 --> 12:38.892
We're breaking a barrier here.

12:38.902 --> 12:41.695
Even if some small-minded
bloggers in their tighty-whities

12:41.730 --> 12:45.257
insist on leering and
jeering along the way.

12:46.693 --> 12:48.927
When Jackie Robinson
made it to the majors,

12:48.996 --> 12:51.763
some of his teammates started a
petition to keep him off the team.

12:51.773 --> 12:53.498
Mm-hmm. One day, before a game,

12:53.567 --> 12:56.201
a player threw a black
cat onto the field,

12:56.303 --> 12:57.802
said it was his cousin.

12:59.306 --> 13:02.908
That day, Jackie doubled and scored.

13:02.918 --> 13:05.840
And told the guy, I guess my
cousin's pretty happy now.

13:05.850 --> 13:07.846
I'm not comparing myself
to Jackie Robinson

13:07.923 --> 13:09.550
because that would be ridiculous.

13:09.744 --> 13:10.857
The leering and jeering?

13:11.319 --> 13:14.869
I can take the leering and
jeering as long as I get to play.

13:14.962 --> 13:18.690
But I'm not even in the
damn game right now.

13:21.209 --> 13:22.928
I need to get back on the hill.

13:24.012 --> 13:25.363
You will.

13:26.741 --> 13:28.066
Yeah. I'll see you up there.

13:28.202 --> 13:29.301
All right.

13:29.601 --> 13:30.984
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:30.994 --> 13:32.165
You coming to San Francisco?

13:32.175 --> 13:33.416
I am. Are you?

13:33.426 --> 13:35.106
Yeah, why wouldn't I be?

13:35.175 --> 13:37.119
I-I heard that you got hurt.

13:37.129 --> 13:39.544
No, that's the other catcher.

13:39.613 --> 13:41.112
Oh, I thought that I heard something

13:41.181 --> 13:43.048
about you being replaced by a catcher.

13:43.116 --> 13:45.250
- From Cuba.
- No.

13:45.319 --> 13:47.752
- Then where's he from?
- No... Livan is from Cuba,

13:47.762 --> 13:49.054
but he's not replacing me.

13:49.156 --> 13:51.623
Not for a long time. Maybe never.
He's my backup.

13:51.692 --> 13:53.625
So, were you guys just

13:53.760 --> 13:55.260
talking about me?

13:56.166 --> 13:58.436
- I'm not doing this, Mike.
- Doing what?

13:58.446 --> 14:00.757
This, like, thrust and
parry flirty talk,

14:00.767 --> 14:02.634
or go to dinner with
you in San Francisco.

14:02.703 --> 14:04.279
I didn't ask you to dinner.

14:04.437 --> 14:06.538
You said you don't do road trips.

14:15.071 --> 14:17.282
Uh, Sonny. Did you go
over hitters with Livan?

14:17.351 --> 14:18.516
Nope.

14:18.585 --> 14:20.318
You sat next to him on the flight.

14:20.328 --> 14:23.358
He says when he deals with
hitters, he goes by feel.

14:23.368 --> 14:25.102
- "Goes by feel"?
- Yeah.

14:28.937 --> 14:30.562
Yeah.

14:32.626 --> 14:34.942
You do know it's just a quirk
in the schedule, right?

14:34.952 --> 14:37.302
We have two days off in ten days, so...

14:38.813 --> 14:40.305
The whole world's about to see me naked.

14:40.315 --> 14:41.641
What?

14:42.442 --> 14:44.509
I sent some selfies to an ex.

14:44.578 --> 14:46.581
- Are you serious?
- It was years ago.

14:46.591 --> 14:48.513
He got hacked and

14:48.931 --> 14:52.701
now they're coming out online on
some sketchy underground Web sites.

14:52.711 --> 14:54.878
First, you're gonna tell
me the name of this ex,

14:54.888 --> 14:57.714
so I can teach him about
Internet security the hard way.

14:57.724 --> 14:59.958
- Oh, Blip...
- Second, you need to explain to me

14:59.968 --> 15:02.654
why would you even take
those type of photos, Ginny?

15:02.664 --> 15:05.730
First, I don't need
your help with an ex.

15:05.832 --> 15:08.466
Second, like you've never
been lonely on the road?

15:08.787 --> 15:10.135
Let's see your phone.

15:11.087 --> 15:12.126
I like my Yorkie.

15:12.136 --> 15:14.077
I take pictures of him,
sometimes in outfits.

15:14.087 --> 15:16.508
I don't feel comfortable
showing that around.

15:16.518 --> 15:19.659
Besides, you are a woman.
You got to be smarter than that.

15:20.478 --> 15:21.846
"Smarter"?

15:22.695 --> 15:24.816
Unlike me. I should not have said that.

15:24.918 --> 15:26.051
Mm.

15:26.119 --> 15:28.186
It, it's my body.

15:28.255 --> 15:30.355
It's my damn business.

15:30.365 --> 15:32.090
I didn't do anything wrong, except maybe

15:32.159 --> 15:34.492
show zero photography skills.

15:34.561 --> 15:35.747
I'm sorry, Ginny.

15:35.757 --> 15:37.562
I really am, and if I could trade places

15:37.631 --> 15:39.698
with you for one second, I would.

15:39.800 --> 15:42.033
Seriously. I mean, you know...

15:42.102 --> 15:45.637
Blip unwrapped? That would
blow up the Internet.

15:47.491 --> 15:49.183
Have you seen Amelia?

15:50.992 --> 15:52.744
- Excuse me.
- Thanks.

15:55.356 --> 15:59.184
Amelia. You're right. We need
to be creative and ambitious.

15:59.252 --> 16:01.189
I am so glad to hear you say that.

16:01.199 --> 16:02.810
So, I've got an idea,

16:02.820 --> 16:04.522
but I don't think you're gonna like it.

16:04.532 --> 16:06.157
And it may make things even worse.

16:07.897 --> 16:09.342
What's not to like?

16:12.759 --> 16:14.609
We head into
the top of the sixth inning,

16:14.619 --> 16:16.829
and Livan Duarte digs in.

16:16.897 --> 16:18.819
Oh, I love this guy,
too. He's the real deal.

16:18.829 --> 16:21.093
Power hitter,
got a big arm and the Padres

16:21.103 --> 16:22.735
are really high on him.

16:24.772 --> 16:27.773
That ball is well-hit.

16:27.842 --> 16:30.960
And... gone.

16:30.970 --> 16:32.437
And that's a home run for the rookie

16:32.505 --> 16:36.368
in his first Major League
at bat. Unbelievable.

16:36.378 --> 16:38.919
Does Livan know we're down six-two?

16:39.121 --> 16:39.977
I guess not.

16:40.046 --> 16:42.757
Oh, that was a big home run
and this place is buzzing.

16:42.767 --> 16:47.085
I don't think the Giants really
appreciated Livan's bat flip.

16:51.671 --> 16:52.825
What are you doing?

16:52.835 --> 16:55.173
Getting my running in.
You already ran this morning.

16:55.183 --> 16:57.329
It's been crazy lately,
and since you won't let me pitch...

16:57.339 --> 16:59.039
I'm not punishing you.

16:59.049 --> 17:02.280
Well, on that mound is the
only place that feels normal.

17:02.290 --> 17:03.975
Turn that off.

17:10.339 --> 17:11.709
Been working on a cutter.
You want to see it?

17:11.778 --> 17:13.511
No. I don't. You're done.

17:13.579 --> 17:15.546
Now, go get showered and dressed.
I'm taking you out.

17:15.582 --> 17:17.647
- Excuse me?
- You're taking an evening

17:17.684 --> 17:19.079
and you're not gonna
think about your cutter

17:19.089 --> 17:20.914
or your missed start or that cannonball

17:20.924 --> 17:23.654
into that swimming pool.
You're going out with me tonight.

17:24.180 --> 17:26.656
- I have a shrink.
- And I have a dietician.

17:26.726 --> 17:28.693
But we're still going out on the town,

17:29.196 --> 17:32.630
and you are going to enjoy the
best gnocchi outside of Italy,

17:32.640 --> 17:37.782
served by waiters who knew DiMaggio.
You're in my hometown, Baker,

17:37.792 --> 17:39.670
and if this place can't clear
your head, nothing can.

17:39.739 --> 17:41.788
Now, go, go. Go get showered.

17:43.042 --> 17:44.142
Here.

17:45.419 --> 17:47.645
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

17:47.714 --> 17:49.380
Been here before, but, you know...

17:49.449 --> 17:51.891
if we're gonna make the
playoffs, we got to...

17:53.852 --> 17:55.178
Oh! Livan!

17:55.188 --> 17:57.615
Two homers today. Impressive.

17:57.625 --> 18:00.567
Some of the Giants didn't like that
bat flip in the game you lost 9-3.

18:00.577 --> 18:01.659
No entiendo.

18:01.761 --> 18:04.109
Can we get his interpreter here?
Where's, uh, Julio?

18:04.119 --> 18:06.230
- No entiendo.
- No, L-Livan...

18:06.332 --> 18:08.833
Please, just one... Livan!

18:08.902 --> 18:10.935
Mike, what do you think about a rookie

18:10.970 --> 18:13.030
flipping his bat in a 9-3 loss?

18:13.040 --> 18:15.773
Well, in his defense, we were
only down 6-1 when he hit it.

18:15.842 --> 18:18.509
Tell us about your error that kept
the inning going in the second.

18:18.578 --> 18:20.369
Like I said, I backed up
on the ball. Thanks, guys.

18:20.379 --> 18:22.234
One last question!
Does Livan's style of play

18:22.244 --> 18:24.333
bug old-schoolers like you?

18:26.152 --> 18:28.181
Livan is a rising star.

18:28.191 --> 18:31.264
He's, he brings an enthusiasm
that's contagious.

18:31.274 --> 18:33.679
We're delighted to have
him in our line-up.

18:37.138 --> 18:38.688
He's a punk.

18:39.287 --> 18:41.791
He preps hitters by
checking their horoscopes,

18:41.801 --> 18:44.666
flips his bat like we won 9-3.

18:44.676 --> 18:46.994
Stiffs the press in a smirking Spanish

18:47.004 --> 18:49.856
when his English is better than
half the Americans on the team.

18:49.866 --> 18:52.084
- He's new. He'll learn.
- Yeah. As soon as the guy

18:52.094 --> 18:53.694
who signed him makes him
play by the same rules

18:53.762 --> 18:55.892
- as everyone else.
- Oh, you think he's afraid of me?

18:55.902 --> 18:57.667
Do you think he's afraid of
anybody else in this clubhouse?

18:57.677 --> 18:59.499
I can think of a good way to find out.

18:59.602 --> 19:02.202
I'll tell you what he's afraid of.

19:02.237 --> 19:05.172
A pair of bright shining lights,
ten miles from the shore.

19:05.240 --> 19:07.998
Because when you see those lights
out there from your leaky boat,

19:08.008 --> 19:11.445
Coast Guard's gonna nab you,
and send you straight back to Cuba.

19:11.455 --> 19:13.447
That happened to him five times

19:13.457 --> 19:15.475
before baseball got him off the island.

19:15.485 --> 19:18.852
But, hey, it's better than
getting eaten by a shark.

19:18.921 --> 19:21.254
Or being jailed, like his parents.

19:26.162 --> 19:28.562
I'll talk to him.

19:28.631 --> 19:30.731
He's gonna need a little time.

19:30.741 --> 19:33.141
He didn't get here by following rules.

19:33.647 --> 19:36.847
A lot of guys in that clubhouse
had rough childhoods.

19:40.309 --> 19:41.541
Good.

19:41.644 --> 19:43.043
Let me show you something.

19:43.112 --> 19:45.282
When you get a low pitch like that,

19:45.292 --> 19:46.847
You get a low pitch...

19:46.915 --> 19:49.382
lift that glove up,

19:50.252 --> 19:52.636
frame it as a strike. You got it?

19:52.883 --> 19:54.345
Good.

19:55.491 --> 19:57.858
You got a real gift as a
backstop, you know that?

19:57.926 --> 19:59.493
It's boring, Coach.

19:59.954 --> 20:01.179
Can I just play first?

20:01.189 --> 20:04.197
Oh, it's boring to have the most
important job on the field?

20:04.233 --> 20:06.261
'Cause the catcher knows everything.

20:06.271 --> 20:08.769
He knows every pitcher and every
hitter sideways and backwards,

20:08.837 --> 20:10.579
he knows how to be a diplomat,

20:10.589 --> 20:12.491
how to protect his
pitchers from the ump,

20:12.501 --> 20:14.541
how to position the outfielders.

20:14.610 --> 20:17.840
Right? I mean, the catcher
is the real boss, Mike.

20:17.850 --> 20:21.048
The natural leader. And that's you.

20:21.752 --> 20:25.312
Plus, you get to wear all that armor,
like a medieval knight. Hey.

20:25.313 --> 20:27.093
Dave, you said you were gonna
meet us across the street.

20:27.103 --> 20:28.502
- We're late.
- Yeah, honey.

20:28.512 --> 20:29.985
I-I lost track of time.

20:29.995 --> 20:31.858
We made a reservation.

20:32.179 --> 20:34.258
My mom will be here.

20:34.268 --> 20:36.023
It's a short walk to the bus.

20:36.033 --> 20:37.626
I like to walk.

20:38.719 --> 20:39.979
Okay.

20:41.140 --> 20:43.940
We'll see you next time,
Mike. Good practice.

20:57.130 --> 20:59.570
I think I need to run off that gnocchi.

21:00.211 --> 21:02.434
I need a marathon, actually.

21:02.444 --> 21:03.846
Gnocchi was the marathon.

21:03.915 --> 21:06.049
This, this is the cooldown.

21:06.184 --> 21:07.650
Sit.

21:08.631 --> 21:10.353
I don't do well sitting still...

21:10.422 --> 21:12.306
There's a city out there, Baker, in case

21:12.316 --> 21:14.991
you haven't noticed, which you haven't.

21:16.260 --> 21:18.194
You're right.

21:19.854 --> 21:21.315
It's a nice one.

21:21.325 --> 21:23.524
I used to come here when I was a kid.

21:23.534 --> 21:25.835
Played Little League
about a mile from here.

21:27.023 --> 21:28.909
So this was your spot.

21:29.774 --> 21:32.308
Yeah. You know,

21:32.318 --> 21:34.977
baseball... The head games,

21:35.080 --> 21:36.612
the need to perform,

21:37.129 --> 21:41.125
it's like this big, wet fish.
You cling too tightly and...

21:41.135 --> 21:44.253
it slips through your hands.

21:44.289 --> 21:47.290
So that's why I started coming here.

21:47.358 --> 21:49.695
Before the Little League All-Star game.

21:49.705 --> 21:52.585
Before the State Championship.

21:54.442 --> 21:57.834
Before I asked my wife to marry me.

21:57.936 --> 22:01.237
Times the pressure was
gonna swallow me whole

22:01.306 --> 22:04.040
for some peace in here.

22:08.548 --> 22:10.469
Did it work for you?

22:11.483 --> 22:14.581
Never. Not a once.

22:14.669 --> 22:16.385
But there's a first time
for everything, right?

22:16.395 --> 22:17.948
Yeah.

22:19.644 --> 22:23.009
The pitcher's mound can't
be your normal, Baker.

22:23.212 --> 22:25.089
Hell, a whole baseball career is just

22:25.099 --> 22:27.186
a tiny sliver of your life.

22:28.005 --> 22:31.300
You better be ready to
find happiness without it.

22:48.289 --> 22:52.054
Do I hate Livan because he's
so good or because he's so annoying?

22:54.186 --> 22:57.318
Oh, he even has more
game with the ladies than you.

22:57.328 --> 22:59.478
I think we just hit the trifecta.

23:00.935 --> 23:02.384
I'll be right back.

23:02.394 --> 23:04.821
If she has anything to say
about it, you probably will.

23:04.831 --> 23:07.529
She and I are fine, okay? Hey.

23:07.826 --> 23:10.592
Didn't we meet in a
hotel once upon a time?

23:10.602 --> 23:12.074
It was quite the fairy tale.

23:12.210 --> 23:14.159
Surprise ending, too.
It was nice catching up.

23:14.169 --> 23:16.027
Listen, I just want to make sure that

23:16.037 --> 23:19.482
You and I... are okay.

23:20.852 --> 23:23.051
- Of course.
- If for no other reason, for Ginny.

23:23.061 --> 23:24.887
So let's get along for
the sake of the kid?

23:24.956 --> 23:28.224
She's important to you.
She's important to me.

23:28.293 --> 23:30.960
Amelia, for the team.

23:34.084 --> 23:35.798
Stop with the face.

23:35.900 --> 23:37.561
This is my thinking face.

23:37.571 --> 23:40.236
Your thinking face looks eerily
close to your "judgey" face.

23:40.305 --> 23:41.643
You're right.

23:42.128 --> 23:44.557
- Ginny comes first.
- Okay. Thank you.

23:44.567 --> 23:46.409
So you want to help her

23:46.477 --> 23:47.779
- and the team...
- Yeah.

23:47.789 --> 23:49.055
Good.

23:49.065 --> 23:52.217
But once you're in, Lawson,
there is no turning back.

24:00.080 --> 24:01.858
Livan missed early work.

24:01.926 --> 24:04.097
- He prep with Pete?
- Pete couldn't find him.

24:04.107 --> 24:06.357
At least he blew me off to my face.

24:07.106 --> 24:09.088
Probably not back from his double date.

24:09.098 --> 24:10.700
Oh, here he comes.

24:14.301 --> 24:16.476
- I don't want to judge.
- Then don't judge.

24:16.486 --> 24:19.108
Whatever you do at night, believe me,

24:19.118 --> 24:22.044
I've done it harder and longer,
but I never skipped the work.

24:22.113 --> 24:24.447
I got to hit the batting cage.

24:24.515 --> 24:25.982
- Is there a problem here?
- Yeah.

24:25.992 --> 24:27.450
- Livan was...
- Nope.

24:27.518 --> 24:29.018
All good.

24:31.597 --> 24:34.262
Dude, what are you doing?
He was late for practice.

24:34.272 --> 24:35.796
You want to compare attendance records?

24:35.806 --> 24:37.937
We've both been late for practice.

24:39.530 --> 24:40.997
Second base.

24:43.101 --> 24:44.615
Good.

24:46.721 --> 24:48.704
Mike, you're over an hour late.

24:48.773 --> 24:50.439
That is now how we do it here.

24:54.065 --> 24:55.898
I might have to quit the team.

24:56.144 --> 24:57.880
My mom's car broke down.

24:57.949 --> 25:00.683
The belt, I think.
Work was already hard to find,

25:00.785 --> 25:02.756
and now she's late for interviews.

25:02.766 --> 25:05.145
Took me two buses to get here.

25:15.632 --> 25:17.201
So?

25:20.443 --> 25:22.440
Great job, baby.

25:22.730 --> 25:24.440
Let's get you some dinner to celebrate.

25:28.653 --> 25:30.379
Yeah, I definitely feel
a new responsibility,

25:30.448 --> 25:33.122
after being an All-Star to
help the team dig in...

25:33.132 --> 25:35.155
Livan, we hear there's been some tension

25:35.165 --> 25:37.687
- between you and your teammates.
- And that you missed a practice today.

25:37.755 --> 25:38.984
Uh, no entiendo.

25:38.994 --> 25:41.016
Oh, come on, Livan,
there's a club translator

25:41.026 --> 25:42.784
- 50 yards from here.
- Hey, guys, come on.

25:42.794 --> 25:44.631
Time's up, you know how
this works... no press in

25:44.641 --> 25:47.215
the clubhouse two hours before
game time. Give him a break.

25:47.225 --> 25:48.811
He barely speaks any English.

25:48.987 --> 25:50.633
But fortunately, I'm fluent in Spanish,

25:50.668 --> 25:53.496
thanks to Mrs. Miranda in the
ninth through 12th grades.

25:53.506 --> 25:55.271
And he told me exactly
what he wants to say.

25:55.340 --> 25:56.516
I got you, buddy.

25:56.526 --> 25:59.075
Uh, yeah, yeah, he missed,
uh, his warm-up.

25:59.085 --> 26:01.277
Um, he says that he's, you know,
finding his way around here.

26:01.346 --> 26:04.480
But what he has found is
the value of humility.

26:04.490 --> 26:06.716
Of respecting those with experience.

26:06.784 --> 26:09.618
Those that know better.
And he says that he wants to learn

26:09.687 --> 26:13.622
from the greats so that someday, and-and
honestly, that day may never come,

26:13.691 --> 26:15.925
he might be one of them,
'cause he knows it's

26:15.994 --> 26:19.128
not easy to get here, not for anyone.

26:19.197 --> 26:22.064
So why blow it for the whole team?

26:22.133 --> 26:24.300
No es verdad, Livan?

26:35.583 --> 26:37.884
Hey, you made me look like a fool.

26:37.953 --> 26:40.213
Thanks, but you did that
pretty well on your own.

26:40.223 --> 26:42.029
It's none of your business
of I speak to press.

26:42.039 --> 26:45.292
I hate to break it to you, but I'm
still captain, so it is my business.

26:45.360 --> 26:46.893
I play hard off the field,

26:46.962 --> 26:48.662
and I deliver on it.

26:48.730 --> 26:50.230
That's what you don't like, old man.

26:51.875 --> 26:54.100
Yeah, I'm older. I can count.

26:54.136 --> 26:56.002
And yeah, I'm jealous that
you get to skip the work,

26:56.071 --> 26:58.805
hit homers, and throw out
runners while being hung over.

26:58.874 --> 27:00.340
But you're younger,

27:00.375 --> 27:02.008
which means I know things you don't.

27:02.077 --> 27:03.870
Like how to beat on rookies?

27:03.967 --> 27:05.412
How to be a better catcher.

27:05.481 --> 27:06.880
I deserve to be here.

27:06.949 --> 27:08.815
- I sacrificed.
- I know you did.

27:08.884 --> 27:10.650
You want a short career, do it your way.

27:10.719 --> 27:13.320
You want to play for 15 years
and make it to Cooperstown,

27:13.388 --> 27:15.255
do it mine.

27:15.891 --> 27:18.680
In English, this is where
you say, "Yes, Captain.

27:18.865 --> 27:20.026
Thank you, Captain."

27:20.128 --> 27:21.643
No, you be captain.

27:21.811 --> 27:24.698
Me? I'm gonna be catcher.

27:32.226 --> 27:34.708
You wanted a plan
to neutralize the selfies.

27:34.743 --> 27:37.268
- This is it.
- No. I want you to solve the problem,

27:37.278 --> 27:38.732
not create a brand-new one.

27:38.742 --> 27:40.758
So you're saying the Padres
aren't comfortable with it.

27:40.768 --> 27:43.242
I'm saying it's risky,
and I need to run it by MLB.

27:43.252 --> 27:44.452
I shouldn't have come here just now.

27:44.462 --> 27:47.187
No, no, you should have come to
me with all this a lot sooner.

27:49.023 --> 27:50.290
Let's go, Giants!

27:50.359 --> 27:51.997
Let's go, Giants!

27:52.007 --> 27:53.360
Remember, it's the seventh inning.

27:53.462 --> 27:54.728
And Padres skipper Al Luongo

27:54.796 --> 27:56.298
is running low on relief pitchers.

27:56.308 --> 27:59.366
Especially after getting deep in the
bullpen in last night's loss.

27:59.434 --> 28:01.468
Liam Dunbar steps in here

28:01.537 --> 28:05.605
with a man on and the
Giants trailing by one.

28:05.674 --> 28:07.313
And that ball is hit deep to left.

28:07.323 --> 28:09.860
Hanan to the wall... gone!

28:09.870 --> 28:13.380
Home run, and the Giants
take a 7-6 lead.

28:13.482 --> 28:15.115
It's gonna be one of those days.

28:15.183 --> 28:17.817
And that's going to be all for Hunter.

28:17.886 --> 28:21.655
The AT&T Call to the Bullpen
brings out manager Al Luongo

28:21.757 --> 28:25.183
to make a pitching change
here in the seventh inning.

28:25.193 --> 28:26.920
- Got one up.
- All right.

28:28.063 --> 28:31.398
It looks like he's calling for
Doherty here to put out the tire fire.

28:31.466 --> 28:33.734
The pitch. Ground ball...

28:33.744 --> 28:36.803
through Mike Lawson's legs...
Two runs score.

28:36.838 --> 28:40.307
And this game is tied here in the ninth.

28:41.827 --> 28:46.004
And here comes the skipper,
and he's gonna go with the right-hander.

28:46.406 --> 28:48.982
Al is calling for the lefty.

28:49.084 --> 28:52.134
And it's gonna be the
righty here in the tenth.

28:52.293 --> 28:55.422
So after 11 innings,
it's the Giants and the Padres

28:55.524 --> 28:57.424
all tied up at ten.

28:57.492 --> 28:59.125
How's our bullpen?

28:59.194 --> 29:02.228
We're running dangerously
low on right arms.

29:08.234 --> 29:10.798
Remember I told you to come
to San Francisco and not

29:10.808 --> 29:13.008
- think about baseball?
- Yeah.

29:13.018 --> 29:15.184
Well, start thinking about baseball.

29:15.194 --> 29:16.543
Warm up.

29:26.692 --> 29:28.188
Hey, Kuip, look who's warming up.

29:28.290 --> 29:31.807
Giants fans are gonna get their
first look at Ginny Baker.

29:31.817 --> 29:33.517
I love this.

29:34.363 --> 29:35.862
That ball is hit into the gap.

29:35.931 --> 29:37.330
Here comes Sanders around third.

29:37.399 --> 29:39.833
The throw is way late. Safe!

29:39.901 --> 29:43.236
Padres grab the lead here in the 13th.

29:43.338 --> 29:46.355
Moore trying to close
out the Giants here.

29:49.478 --> 29:53.146
Ball four, and the bases are loaded.

29:53.215 --> 29:55.371
Only one out, and the Padres clinging

29:55.381 --> 29:57.250
to that one-run lead.

29:59.135 --> 30:03.954
And Al Luongo is calling for
the righty. And, folks, guess what...

30:04.192 --> 30:06.026
Ginny Baker is coming in to pitch

30:06.094 --> 30:10.063
in a relief role,
facing a bases-loaded jam.

30:20.558 --> 30:22.180
I'm gonna bring the infield in.

30:22.190 --> 30:24.038
I need you to get the next guy to hit

30:24.048 --> 30:27.098
a grounder to any infielder
not named Mike Lawson.

30:28.859 --> 30:31.098
You ever relieve before?

30:31.204 --> 30:33.001
Not even in Little League.

30:33.319 --> 30:34.604
Seriously?

30:34.954 --> 30:36.276
Seriously.

30:38.677 --> 30:41.377
There's a first time
for everything, right?

30:42.349 --> 30:44.614
Make me look smart, Baker.

30:48.863 --> 30:50.763
What do you want to do here?

30:56.789 --> 30:58.161
You sent him to scam me...

30:58.230 --> 30:59.715
Do you want him in practice or not?

30:59.725 --> 31:02.552
I've loaned you money, what,
seven times? This is how you behave.

31:02.562 --> 31:05.102
Grab your things, we're leaving.
We're leaving right now!

31:05.112 --> 31:06.500
But why?

31:13.838 --> 31:15.878
Can I live with you?

31:18.728 --> 31:20.483
Mike, I wish you could.

31:22.454 --> 31:24.103
I have a family.

31:25.997 --> 31:27.239
And there's just no way.

31:27.249 --> 31:30.727
Hey! I want you out of here right now!

31:36.050 --> 31:37.700
Mike, listen to me.

31:37.769 --> 31:39.602
You don't have to do what she says.

31:40.534 --> 31:41.775
All right?

31:41.785 --> 31:43.906
Okay, not if you don't think it's right.

31:43.975 --> 31:45.875
You're strong.

31:45.944 --> 31:47.944
You make the right choice.

31:49.166 --> 31:52.448
And then if she's not
gonna be the adult...

31:53.204 --> 31:54.984
then you can be.

32:10.620 --> 32:12.520
What do you want to do here?

32:14.364 --> 32:15.764
He's your catcher.

32:16.611 --> 32:17.756
Trust him.

32:19.537 --> 32:22.278
- All right, let's go.
- Heard you have a cutter.

32:22.380 --> 32:24.321
Yeah, I don't know if I can
throw it for a strike yet.

32:24.331 --> 32:27.085
Good. Don't. He'll swing if it's close.

32:27.217 --> 32:29.736
This guy... played with him in the WBC.

32:29.746 --> 32:32.988
Likes to be hero. Just don't
throw it on the backstop.

32:37.671 --> 32:40.930
And here we go. Bases loaded, one out.

32:40.999 --> 32:43.132
11-10, Padres.

32:45.326 --> 32:47.937
There's nowhere to put Luke Brady.

32:51.826 --> 32:55.345
Ginny Baker peers in for
the sign from Duarte.

32:57.496 --> 33:00.917
Ginny sets... and here's the pitch.

33:02.536 --> 33:04.921
Brady swings. A hard smash toward first.

33:04.989 --> 33:06.489
- He got it!
- There's one...

33:06.558 --> 33:07.657
back to first.

33:07.726 --> 33:09.492
A double play!

33:09.561 --> 33:13.663
And there's your ball game.
Ginny Baker battles out of the jam

33:13.732 --> 33:16.366
- and the Padres win.
- Oh, ho, my.

33:16.434 --> 33:18.292
Just like you drew it up.

33:18.302 --> 33:20.670
And the game ends on a nice
backhanded play by Mike Lawson.

33:20.739 --> 33:22.651
A one-pitch save for Ginny Baker

33:22.661 --> 33:24.783
on a three-two-three double play.

33:24.793 --> 33:26.275
You don't see that often.

33:26.344 --> 33:28.826
You sure fooled that hitter.
He crushed that ball.

33:28.836 --> 33:30.646
You sure fooled everyone by catching it.

33:30.749 --> 33:32.181
Oh.

33:33.385 --> 33:35.385
You might just stay up here...

33:36.358 --> 33:39.458
Nice play. Looks like we
found a first baseman.

33:49.567 --> 33:51.067
Where are we going?

33:51.136 --> 33:55.086
For starters, Mom's got an appointment
and I'm gonna need your help.

34:10.304 --> 34:14.123
Mike, I need your help and I'll
buy you a video game, okay?

34:18.097 --> 34:19.695
You don't need your father.

34:19.764 --> 34:22.473
If he cared about us,
we wouldn't be leaving.

34:25.601 --> 34:29.806
I'm sorry, honey. That's...
not how I wanted to tell you.

34:44.775 --> 34:45.906
I'm getting cold feet.

34:45.974 --> 34:48.665
It's the right thing to do,
you big baby.

34:48.675 --> 34:51.728
- You're such a Boy Scout.
- I've been called worse.

34:51.739 --> 34:53.911
- Excuse me, guys. Thanks.
- Sorry.

34:53.980 --> 34:56.402
- Mike, here, quick question.
- Livan just learned English,

34:56.413 --> 34:58.378
- go talk to him.
- No, no. I have a source that says

34:58.388 --> 35:01.408
you might be put on waivers,
in an effort to trade you.

35:02.700 --> 35:05.951
That's a question for the
front office, not me. Thanks.

35:07.159 --> 35:09.694
- What the hell?
- I don't know.

35:17.660 --> 35:19.671
Relax. You're gonna look amazing.

35:22.142 --> 35:23.408
Can we shut that?

35:24.978 --> 35:26.678
Everything is gonna be fine.

35:44.052 --> 35:47.302
So, old selfies of a female
athlete were leaked to the Internet.

35:47.312 --> 35:49.984
Is anyone surprised, really?

35:49.994 --> 35:52.804
Some loser with a laptop
invaded Ginny Baker's privacy

35:52.872 --> 35:55.114
to tell us what we already know:

35:55.124 --> 35:59.756
Ginny Baker's got a body,
a damn good body, actually.

35:59.766 --> 36:02.250
And annoying as it is to
have her personal life hacked

36:02.260 --> 36:03.715
- to shreds, Ginny Baker must've
- No way.

36:03.783 --> 36:06.951
realized at some point,
it's not embarrassing that the world's

36:07.020 --> 36:09.320
seeing her body; it's empowering.

36:09.389 --> 36:12.190
Why not show it off even
more and bring along

36:12.292 --> 36:14.025
a few friends for it?

36:16.396 --> 36:17.528
Thank you so much.

36:25.739 --> 36:27.338
Whoa.

36:27.407 --> 36:28.673
Get out of here.

36:30.032 --> 36:31.676
Folks, have you seen these?

36:31.778 --> 36:33.645
Well, you're gonna see a lot of them.

36:33.713 --> 36:37.104
These ESPN Body Issue pictures
were sent out early

36:37.114 --> 36:38.985
to promote the magazine.

36:38.995 --> 36:41.586
Now, we can be cynical about it,
say it's just damage control,

36:41.655 --> 36:43.488
but hey, it worked.

36:43.556 --> 36:45.256
We're talking about these pictures

36:45.325 --> 36:46.854
instead of those old selfies

36:46.864 --> 36:48.741
stolen by some idiot troll,

36:48.959 --> 36:51.241
who I hope... someday finds himself...

36:51.251 --> 36:53.064
...five-game road trip and they made

36:53.133 --> 36:54.699
lots of news, some of it

36:54.768 --> 36:56.868
even on the field.
Let's start with the baseball.

36:56.970 --> 37:00.997
The Padres started their road trip six
games back in the wildcard race...

37:06.304 --> 37:08.413
Busted.

37:15.984 --> 37:18.222
Nice touch pulling in the guys.

37:18.324 --> 37:20.045
Whole world ought to know:

37:20.055 --> 37:21.719
the Padres don't discriminate.

37:21.729 --> 37:23.188
Hmm, you just earned yourself

37:23.198 --> 37:25.730
a nice long conversation
about bobbleheads.

37:31.972 --> 37:35.540
And so she turned a sexist
double standard on its head.

37:35.642 --> 37:39.755
Her very, very male teammates
joined in and made this

37:39.765 --> 37:42.257
an equal opportunity photo spread.

37:42.267 --> 37:45.383
And you can probably tell
by the look on my face,

37:45.452 --> 37:48.218
I am very glad they did that.

37:55.285 --> 37:57.744
There's my baby, there's my baby.

38:09.371 --> 38:12.283
Ginny, Evelyn wants you
to come to dinner tonight

38:12.293 --> 38:14.746
so you could explain what
you did to my reputation.

38:15.371 --> 38:17.949
- I'm in.
- Mike, you want to join us?

38:17.959 --> 38:21.535
Oh, another night flipping through
Yorkie pictures, no thanks.

38:21.545 --> 38:25.795
- I'm gonna turn in early tonight.
- Yeah, we're supposed to believe that?

38:28.284 --> 38:30.786
Hey, call me if you change your mind.

38:36.420 --> 38:38.536
Ooh, sweet ride.

38:38.638 --> 38:40.181
Did you buy it with your bonus?

38:40.678 --> 38:42.840
- Uh, yeah.
- That was stupid.

38:44.235 --> 38:46.617
No, there are dealers out there
that will let you lease this

38:46.627 --> 38:49.205
for a dollar a month, just so that

38:49.215 --> 38:51.678
people can see you
driving their car, but...

38:51.688 --> 38:53.670
but then again, you're a rookie.

38:55.094 --> 38:56.522
Nice road trip.

38:56.803 --> 38:58.599
You're welcome.

38:59.172 --> 39:00.658
You think you're ready to
catch for us full time?

39:00.727 --> 39:02.972
- Only if you're ready to win full time.
- Oh, I am,

39:02.982 --> 39:05.811
which is why you're back
on the bench against Cincinnati.

39:06.075 --> 39:07.861
Oh, you been talking to Mike Lawson

39:07.871 --> 39:09.424
or you do not believe
what your eyes see?

39:09.434 --> 39:11.002
Actually, I have a
decent eye for talent,

39:11.104 --> 39:14.372
which is why I'm well-compensated
for it. Thank you very much.

39:14.440 --> 39:16.641
And I can see that you
have all the tools,

39:16.709 --> 39:21.013
which is why I traveled halfway
across the world to sign you.

39:21.023 --> 39:23.414
There's no bigger fan of you than me.

39:23.752 --> 39:26.083
You're the future, Livan.

39:26.526 --> 39:30.087
But... there's this
thing between your ears,

39:30.642 --> 39:33.127
that hasn't developed
past the low minors.

39:33.137 --> 39:37.084
And because it needs
more seasoning, I see

39:37.094 --> 39:40.114
your ass playing behind
Mike Lawson for awhile.

39:40.124 --> 39:42.533
After what I did in San
Francisco and Colorado?

39:42.602 --> 39:44.068
The air's thin in Colorado.

39:44.137 --> 39:46.218
- Warning track outs at Petco.
- Okay, yeah.

39:46.228 --> 39:47.746
Hey, listen, Livan.

39:48.266 --> 39:50.575
This team is in transition.

39:51.464 --> 39:53.403
You have an opportunity here,

39:53.509 --> 39:54.946
a good one.

39:55.014 --> 39:58.683
So, instead of shutting everyone out,
you need to start studying

39:58.785 --> 40:02.720
their hitters.
Start studying our pitchers.

40:03.058 --> 40:06.357
And prove to me that you're up for this.

40:06.811 --> 40:08.626
Mike Lawson...

40:08.695 --> 40:10.294
he-he's not getting any younger.

40:10.363 --> 40:12.417
You may have to start
sooner than I want.

40:12.427 --> 40:14.108
Injuries happen.

40:14.364 --> 40:16.534
Stuff happens.

40:17.300 --> 40:19.500
You've got to be ready to step up.

40:23.681 --> 40:24.976
You're welcome.

40:47.632 --> 40:49.300
Grandpa. Pitch to me!

40:49.706 --> 40:51.110
Again?

40:51.330 --> 40:52.749
You never stop.

41:02.996 --> 41:04.482
One more.
