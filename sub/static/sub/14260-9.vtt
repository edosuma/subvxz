It's <i> The Squid Monster</i>
<i>That Ate Hoboken!</i>

01:12.606 --> 01:14.940
[Raphael]
A veritable
science fiction classic.

01:14.942 --> 01:18.343
[Michelangelo]
I must've watched
this flick a dozen times!

01:18.345 --> 01:21.012
Actually, you've watched it
two dozen, but who's counting?

01:21.014 --> 01:22.347
Whoa, scope it out, dudes.

01:22.349 --> 01:25.216
Here's the part where
he gets truly unruly.

Hey! What's going on?

01:27.621 --> 01:29.721
It's gotta be
Donatello again.

01:29.723 --> 01:31.756
[All]
Donatello!

01:31.758 --> 01:33.291
Uh, sorry, guys!

01:33.293 --> 01:35.493
I guess I overloaded
the circuit.

01:35.495 --> 01:38.630
Hmm, must be the pentode
and ductoscope.

01:38.632 --> 01:41.232
Maybe it's
the autodyne ignition.

01:41.234 --> 01:43.401
Aha!
I found the trouble.

01:43.403 --> 01:45.737
Donatello's been
blowing out fuses all week

01:45.739 --> 01:48.073
working on that screwball
invention of his.

01:48.075 --> 01:49.774
That's not all he blew out.

01:49.776 --> 01:51.176
Look at the TV!

01:51.178 --> 01:53.011
[Michelangelo]
Major bummer, dudes!

01:53.013 --> 01:54.746
The squid monster
was just about

01:54.748 --> 01:57.015
to chow down on Chinatown.

01:57.017 --> 01:59.283
[Splinter]
Perhaps that was
a fortunate accident,

01:59.285 --> 02:00.451
my students.

02:00.453 --> 02:01.452
You have been watching

02:01.454 --> 02:03.889
far too many
tasteless horror films.

02:03.891 --> 02:07.659
Hey, Sensei, we gotta have
some intellectual stimulation.

02:07.661 --> 02:09.494
My students,
I advise you

02:09.496 --> 02:11.796
to make use of your
own imagination

02:11.798 --> 02:14.732
instead of relying
on other people's.

02:14.734 --> 02:16.701
Now, when I was very young,

02:16.703 --> 02:20.371
I would listen
to sumo wrestling
on the radio.

02:20.373 --> 02:23.941
Now, that required
imagination.

02:23.943 --> 02:27.345
[Burne]
Gang, today we welcome
a brand-new member

02:27.347 --> 02:29.480
to the Channel 6 news team.

02:29.482 --> 02:31.649
He's Milton Frobish III,

02:31.651 --> 02:35.720
the son of Channel 6's
owner, Milton Frobish II.

02:35.722 --> 02:38.623
Gosh, what an incredible
coincidence.

02:38.625 --> 02:40.291
Now, I don't expect you

02:40.293 --> 02:42.827
to show Milton
any special privileges.

02:42.829 --> 02:45.897
He's just like any other
working class stiff.

02:45.899 --> 02:49.634
Who happens to be
worth $23 gazillion.

02:49.636 --> 02:51.069
Any questions?

02:51.071 --> 02:53.304
Just one.
Is he married?

02:53.306 --> 02:56.441
Irma, I hope you
won't embarrass us

02:56.443 --> 02:58.510
by fawning
all over him.

02:58.512 --> 03:03.914
Ladies and gentlemen,
I present Milton Frobish III.

03:03.916 --> 03:05.216
Uh, hello.

03:06.352 --> 03:07.352
D'oh!

03:07.354 --> 03:09.721
What an incredible
honor, sir!

03:09.723 --> 03:11.689
Can I offer you a seat?

03:11.691 --> 03:13.090
Maybe a cup of coffee?

03:13.092 --> 03:14.159
A prune Danish?

03:14.161 --> 03:15.493
If you need
a place to live,

03:15.495 --> 03:17.328
I know a charming
little apartment.

03:17.330 --> 03:19.197
We can move April out
right away.

03:19.199 --> 03:21.366
Vernon! Hey, hey, hey!

03:21.368 --> 03:22.333
Oh, sorry, Chief.

03:22.335 --> 03:24.569
I was just trying
to make him feel at home.

03:24.571 --> 03:26.938
Yes, in my home.

03:26.940 --> 03:30.074
I'm sure we all want
to help young Frobish

03:30.076 --> 03:32.610
learn everything
about Channel 6,

03:32.612 --> 03:35.946
which is why I'm sure
Ms. O'Neil won't mind

03:35.948 --> 03:38.817
if Milton takes her place
doing the news today.

03:38.819 --> 03:40.518
I won't?

03:40.520 --> 03:42.920

Huh! What a turkey!

03:53.533 --> 03:55.833
They should've saved this guy
for a Thanksgiving special.

03:55.835 --> 03:57.702
I wonder what
happened to April.

03:57.704 --> 04:00.238
[Donatello]
Hey, guys,
come in here quick!

04:00.240 --> 04:01.439
It's working fine now.

04:01.441 --> 04:03.674
The parabolic synchronizer
was interfering

04:03.676 --> 04:05.509
with the rheostatic
magnetometer.

04:05.511 --> 04:07.011
That's easy
for you to say.

04:07.013 --> 04:08.112
All right!

04:08.114 --> 04:10.148
Does that mean we can
finish watching

04:10.150 --> 04:12.250
<i>The Squid Monster</i>
<i>That Ate Hoboken?</i>

04:12.252 --> 04:13.384
Trust me.

04:13.386 --> 04:15.887
This invention will make
movies obsolete.

04:15.889 --> 04:19.190
I call it Dream-O-Vision.

04:19.192 --> 04:22.160
Is this the gizmo that keeps
blowing our fuses?

04:22.162 --> 04:23.528
[laughs]
No, no, no.

04:23.530 --> 04:26.064
See, that's
the ultra high-voltage
power transmitter.

04:26.066 --> 04:28.066
It allows
the Dream-O-Vision helmet

04:28.068 --> 04:29.967
to be cordless so you can
take it anywhere.

04:29.969 --> 04:32.904
So, like, what exactly
does it do?

04:32.906 --> 04:35.607
Anything your imagination
can dream up.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.041
Watch this.

04:38.176 --> 04:40.177
And to you, Donatello,

04:40.179 --> 04:43.014
for your great
contributions to science,

04:43.016 --> 04:45.717
we award this
honorary doctorate

04:45.719 --> 04:48.853
and the title
of Turtle Emeritus.

04:48.855 --> 04:51.690
Tubuloso!
Cool!
It's surreal!

04:51.692 --> 04:55.893
See? All you have to do
is imagine something,

04:55.895 --> 04:57.829
and the Dream-O-Vision
turns it into

04:57.831 --> 05:00.231
a life-size hologram.

05:00.233 --> 05:02.033
Here, Leonardo.
You try it.

it's hard to believe

in your mind,
isn't it?

for this gig.

We're back in the lair.

06:29.756 --> 06:30.755
What happened?

06:30.757 --> 06:32.256
Somebody rewrote
my script.

06:32.258 --> 06:34.526
And where did that
weird face come from?

06:34.528 --> 06:37.962
Um, I'm afraid it still
has a few bugs to work out.

06:37.964 --> 06:40.064
You can say that again.

06:40.066 --> 06:43.067
Didn't you say this would
be just a hologram?

06:43.069 --> 06:43.902
Ow!

06:43.904 --> 06:45.603
Ooh,
that's what I thought.

06:45.605 --> 06:47.504
But it looks like
the Dream-O-Vision

06:47.506 --> 06:49.674
can make
imaginary stuff real.

06:49.676 --> 06:51.876
Guys, I'm afraid
this helmet is off limits

06:51.878 --> 06:54.546

what's wrong.

I can't raise him
on the TurtleCom.

09:18.191 --> 09:20.057
Oh, yeah.
Nice timing, Leonardo.

09:20.059 --> 09:22.693
Just when Vinny was about
to bring the check!

09:22.695 --> 09:24.895
Totally bogus.

09:24.897 --> 09:27.031
The farther I walk
from the ocean,

09:27.033 --> 09:29.900
the louder
the sound of it gets.

09:29.902 --> 09:31.935
Holy guacamole!

09:31.937 --> 09:34.004
A humungous tidal wave!

09:35.273 --> 09:37.574
Hello, Michelangelo!

09:37.576 --> 09:39.543
Remember me?

09:39.545 --> 09:41.545
Yaah!

09:41.547 --> 09:45.049
You can run,
but you can't hide.

09:45.051 --> 09:48.419
Ha ha ha ha ha
ha ha ha ha!

09:48.421 --> 09:51.856
[Milton]
That chocolate cake
made me break out in hives.

09:51.858 --> 09:54.024
These spots look awful.

09:54.026 --> 09:56.060
[April]
Um, no they don't, Milton.

09:56.062 --> 09:59.563
They make you look,
um...uh, daring!

09:59.565 --> 10:00.498
[chuckles]
Oh.

10:00.500 --> 10:01.699
Well, no matter.

10:01.701 --> 10:03.200
Let us carry on.

10:03.202 --> 10:05.069
I have a brand-new
career to launch.

10:05.071 --> 10:07.471
Right. And you can start
by climbing up there

10:07.473 --> 10:09.840
and bringing me
those video cassettes.

10:09.842 --> 10:11.509
Certainly, Ms. O'Neil.

10:11.511 --> 10:13.177
Dad will be
so proud of me.

10:13.179 --> 10:15.045
My first day on the job,

10:15.047 --> 10:17.415
and I've already worked
my way to the top.

10:17.417 --> 10:19.984
Egads! Milton!

10:19.986 --> 10:21.085
Come down from there!

10:21.087 --> 10:22.519
You'll hurt yourself!

10:23.989 --> 10:26.457
Whoa!

10:26.459 --> 10:27.725
Ooh!

10:27.727 --> 10:29.059
Now see what you've done?

10:29.061 --> 10:30.862
What I did?

10:30.864 --> 10:34.064
Yes. I can hardly wait to tell
Milton's father on you.

10:34.066 --> 10:35.533
Oh, brother.

10:35.535 --> 10:36.801
Good idea, Irma.

10:36.803 --> 10:38.936
Maybe I'll tell
his brother, too.

10:38.938 --> 10:42.006
I wonder if this helmet's
dried out enough

10:42.008 --> 10:43.908
to split this scene.

10:43.910 --> 10:45.376
[sizzling]

10:45.378 --> 10:48.812
Nope. Looks like I'll have
to fall back to plan B.

10:48.814 --> 10:51.315
I'll just imagine
I'm doing something fun.

10:51.317 --> 10:54.685
Yeah! Like playing sports.

10:54.687 --> 10:56.087
[crowd cheering]

10:56.089 --> 10:58.021
All right!
It worked!

10:58.023 --> 11:00.291
[cheering, whistling]

11:00.293 --> 11:03.861
And here comes
Michelangelo le Turtle
across the blue line,

11:03.863 --> 11:07.498
looking for his 300th
hat trick of the season!

11:07.500 --> 11:08.799
Rahh!

11:08.801 --> 11:10.634
Holy guacamole!

11:10.636 --> 11:12.270
Whoa!

11:13.772 --> 11:14.939
Ooh!

11:14.941 --> 11:17.642
Help! Stop!
Let me outta here!

11:17.644 --> 11:20.010
If you're certain
that's what you want,

11:20.012 --> 11:22.647
then you shall have it!

11:29.654 --> 11:32.657
Aah!
[roaring]

11:35.193 --> 11:37.928
Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha!

11:39.197 --> 11:42.666
Lucky thing us turtles
are primo swimmers!

11:44.469 --> 11:48.038
We meet again.
Aah!

11:52.377 --> 11:54.178
[gasps]

11:54.180 --> 11:55.580
I don't get it.

11:55.582 --> 11:59.049
I'm not thinking about
any of these bizarro places.

11:59.051 --> 12:01.218
But I am!

12:01.220 --> 12:03.888
Hey, dude, I'm getting
just a teensy bit

12:03.890 --> 12:05.322
tired of this.

12:05.324 --> 12:06.891
Just who are you?

12:06.893 --> 12:12.095
They call me Creepy Eddie,
and I'm your worst nightmare!

12:12.097 --> 12:13.797
I've been
waiting for someone

12:13.799 --> 12:15.867
from your universe
to pass through.

12:15.869 --> 12:20.704
All I need is one more
for a two-for-one exchange.

12:20.706 --> 12:22.806
Uh, exchange?

12:22.808 --> 12:24.275
Exactly!

12:24.277 --> 12:27.044
You two will stay here
in Nightmare Land,

12:27.046 --> 12:30.180
while I invade reality!

12:30.182 --> 12:33.351
Whoa!

12:33.353 --> 12:36.521
You'll love it here
once you get used to it.

12:36.523 --> 12:38.655
Why not give it a whirl?

12:38.657 --> 12:41.024
Ah ha ha ha ha ha!

12:44.195 --> 12:45.763
[TurtleCom beeping]
The TurtleCom.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.931
April here.
What's up?

12:47.933 --> 12:49.033
<i>[Leonardo]</i>
<i>April, I'm worried.</i>

12:49.035 --> 12:51.001
<i>Have you heard</i>
<i>from Michelangelo?</i>

12:51.003 --> 12:52.469
No, I haven't, Leonardo.

12:52.471 --> 12:53.770
Is there anything wrong?

12:53.772 --> 12:55.505
<i>I sure hope not.</i>

12:55.507 --> 12:58.542
Whoa, that goes
double for me.

13:00.045 --> 13:02.779
Here are those video tapes
Ms. O'Neil asked for.

13:02.781 --> 13:04.715
Thank you, Milton.

13:04.717 --> 13:05.816
Now, young man,

13:05.818 --> 13:07.350
you sit right here
and rest.

13:07.352 --> 13:10.555
You're in no condition
to be doing that.
Ooh!

13:10.557 --> 13:12.623
Vernon, I think
it's absolutely disgusting

13:12.625 --> 13:14.825
the way you keep kissing up
to the boss' son.

13:14.827 --> 13:16.026
Butt out, Irma!

13:16.028 --> 13:17.961
Here, let me carry
those for you.

13:17.963 --> 13:19.363
No, really!

13:19.365 --> 13:21.598
It's quite all--

13:21.600 --> 13:24.768
riiiight!

13:24.770 --> 13:26.470
Milton!

13:26.472 --> 13:27.404
Stop!

13:27.406 --> 13:28.739
[Irma]
You're headed for--

13:28.741 --> 13:31.275
Daddy!

13:31.277 --> 13:32.509
A long flight of stairs.

13:32.511 --> 13:34.979
[groaning]

13:36.815 --> 13:38.849
Michelangelo?

13:38.851 --> 13:41.285
[sigh]
There's no sign
of him anywhere.

13:41.287 --> 13:43.620
[whirring]
That noise.

13:43.622 --> 13:45.756
Sounds like
a vacuum cleaner.

13:45.758 --> 13:49.226
And it's coming
from Donatello's lab.

13:49.228 --> 13:52.429
What? Whoa!

13:54.332 --> 13:57.467
Those stupidly
innocent turtles!

13:57.469 --> 14:00.237
They freed me from
my fantasy dimension

14:00.239 --> 14:03.007
and allowed me to enter
the real world,

14:03.009 --> 14:05.776
where I plan
to stay forever!

14:05.778 --> 14:08.879
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

14:08.881 --> 14:13.350
[Michelangelo]
Whoa! Quit spinning already!

14:13.352 --> 14:16.387
Uh, first it's summer,
then it's winter.

14:16.389 --> 14:17.621
Whoa!

14:17.623 --> 14:21.325
Whoa! Cowabunga!

14:21.327 --> 14:22.860
Hot bubbling lava!

14:23.862 --> 14:25.529
What is this place?

14:25.531 --> 14:27.431
And how did I get here?

14:27.433 --> 14:28.666
Yaah!

14:28.668 --> 14:30.201
It's Michelangelo.

14:35.240 --> 14:37.541
Thanks mucho, compadre.

14:37.543 --> 14:38.742
Never mind that.

14:38.744 --> 14:39.943
The question is

14:39.945 --> 14:42.146
why did you put on
that Dream-O-Vision helmet

14:42.148 --> 14:44.448
when Donatello
warned you not to?

14:44.450 --> 14:46.550
Look, you can
chew me out later, dude.

14:46.552 --> 14:49.186
Right now, we got
one major problemo.

14:49.188 --> 14:49.987
What's that?

14:49.989 --> 14:51.055
If you're here,

14:51.057 --> 14:54.892
that means that Creepy Eddie
must be in the lair.

14:54.894 --> 14:57.628
[Splinter]
I have a bad feeling
about my students.

14:57.630 --> 15:00.464
I fear they may have
fallen under the spell

15:00.466 --> 15:02.266
of some great evil.

15:02.268 --> 15:05.936
You must be talking
about me.

15:05.938 --> 15:06.904
Who are you?

15:06.906 --> 15:08.939
And what have you done
to the Turtles?

15:08.941 --> 15:10.307
I should think a giant rat

15:10.309 --> 15:13.143
would have bigger things
to worry about.

15:13.145 --> 15:16.246
Like, for instance,
a giant cat!

15:16.248 --> 15:18.149
Ah ha ha ha!
[roaring]

15:20.418 --> 15:22.419
[roaring]

15:22.421 --> 15:24.388
Tell me, my friend.

15:24.390 --> 15:26.356
Do you suppose
this is what's meant

15:26.358 --> 15:29.160
by "trapped like a rat"?

15:29.162 --> 15:31.762
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

15:31.764 --> 15:33.430
[roaring]

15:33.432 --> 15:34.932
What was that?

15:34.934 --> 15:37.768
Sounds like someone
forgot to put out the cat.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.103
[roaring]

15:40.805 --> 15:43.073
Master Splinter,
what's going on?

15:43.075 --> 15:45.242
I would say
it is quite obvious.

15:45.244 --> 15:47.344
Maybe he'd like
some pizza!

15:48.913 --> 15:50.114
[Donatello]
Bull's-eye!

15:50.116 --> 15:51.749
Well, actually,
tiger's-eye.

15:51.751 --> 15:54.652
[Creepy Eddie laughs]
Oh, goody! More turtles!

15:54.654 --> 15:56.754
Come and join the party.

15:56.756 --> 15:59.689
Look, it's that
weird thing we saw

15:59.691 --> 16:01.492
floating above
the pirate ship.

16:01.494 --> 16:04.528
"Weird thing?" How rude!

16:04.530 --> 16:07.864
I don't have to stay here
and be insulted.

16:07.866 --> 16:10.300
Master Splinter,
are you all right?

16:10.302 --> 16:14.271
Yes, thanks to your
pizza marksmanship.

16:14.273 --> 16:16.106
But where are Michelangelo
and Leonardo?

16:16.108 --> 16:19.109
Uh, we were sorta hoping
you had the answer to that.

16:20.345 --> 16:22.780
[creature burbling]

16:22.782 --> 16:25.116
So this is your
nightmare world.

16:25.118 --> 16:28.452
How do you think up all these
gruesome creatures?

16:28.454 --> 16:30.120
I guess it comes
from all those

16:30.122 --> 16:32.422
sci-fi horror movies
I watch.

16:32.424 --> 16:36.160
[roaring, squelching]

16:36.162 --> 16:37.995
From now on,
you'd better stick

16:37.997 --> 16:39.997
to renting
kiddie cartoons.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.499
Gnarly notion, dude!

16:41.501 --> 16:44.001
I'll remember that
if we ever get back home.

16:45.470 --> 16:48.339
Listen, I think I've
tuned in to something.

16:48.341 --> 16:50.407
Oops!
Wrong channel!

16:50.409 --> 16:52.910
Aah!

16:52.912 --> 16:56.447
[Burne]
April, do you realize
what you've done?

16:56.449 --> 16:59.850
You single-handedly
disgraced Channel 6!

16:59.852 --> 17:01.618
I'm sorry, Chief.

17:01.620 --> 17:04.488
I asked you to look
after the boss' son,

17:04.490 --> 17:06.423
and what happens?

17:07.759 --> 17:09.660
This is what happens.

17:09.662 --> 17:10.861
Who did this to Milton?

17:10.863 --> 17:12.695
Come on, now.
Speak up.

17:12.698 --> 17:14.998
I cannot tell a lie,
Mr. Frobish, sir.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.166
It's all
April O'Neil's fault.

17:17.169 --> 17:19.336
Milton was
her responsibility.

17:19.338 --> 17:21.704
Is this true,
young lady?

17:21.707 --> 17:25.375
Uh, well, um,
you see, sir--

17:25.377 --> 17:27.778
Please don't blame April,
Mr. Frobish.

17:27.780 --> 17:29.646
It's as much my fault
as hers.

17:29.648 --> 17:32.116
Oh, it is, huh?

17:32.118 --> 17:36.387
Well, in that case,
both of you are--

17:36.389 --> 17:37.154
Fired?

17:37.156 --> 17:38.755
No!

17:38.757 --> 17:40.590
On your way to Hawaii

17:40.592 --> 17:43.627
for a two-week
vacation on me!

17:43.629 --> 17:45.129
What?
What?

17:45.131 --> 17:48.665
All that time little Milty
spent in the emergency room

17:48.667 --> 17:52.069
made him realize he's not
cut out for the news game.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.237
Hee hee!

17:53.239 --> 17:56.473
He's decided to go
to medical school.

17:56.475 --> 17:59.810
My son the doctor!

17:59.812 --> 18:00.977
Ouch!

18:00.979 --> 18:03.113
Isn't it unbelievable?

18:03.115 --> 18:05.216
Two whole weeks
in Hawaii.

18:05.218 --> 18:06.650
I'd enjoy it a lot more

18:06.652 --> 18:08.552
if I knew
that Michelangelo
was all right.

18:08.554 --> 18:10.387
<i>Hi. This is Leonardo.</i>

18:10.389 --> 18:12.622
<i>I can't answer</i>
<i>the TurtleCom right now.</i>

18:12.624 --> 18:14.158
<i>I'm off on a nightmare</i>
<i>adventure</i>

18:14.160 --> 18:15.959
<i>from which</i>
<i>I may never return.</i>

18:15.961 --> 18:17.160
Oh, no!

18:17.162 --> 18:20.664
First Michelangelo disappears,
and now Leonardo!

18:20.666 --> 18:23.100
I've got to get
to the lair right away.

18:25.736 --> 18:27.904
[Donatello]
Michelangelo
must've vanished

18:27.906 --> 18:30.073
when he put on
the Dream-O-Vision helmet.

18:30.075 --> 18:32.409
And I'll bet Leonardo
went to track him down.

18:32.411 --> 18:35.712
I fear they are in some
sort of nightmare world.

18:35.714 --> 18:37.814
And only that
Creepy Eddie character

18:37.816 --> 18:39.249
can tell us where.

18:39.251 --> 18:43.086
See that? You do need me!

18:43.088 --> 18:45.856
I demand to know
where Michelangelo
and Leonardo are.

18:45.858 --> 18:49.693
Up to their turtlenecks
in my nightmare world.

18:49.695 --> 18:53.697
And as long as I'm here,
that's where they'll stay!

18:53.699 --> 18:57.268
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

18:57.270 --> 19:00.971
Got to unplug
the Dream-O-Vision
generator.

19:00.973 --> 19:02.205
It's our only hope

19:02.207 --> 19:04.074
of bringing the guys
back to reality.

19:04.076 --> 19:05.942
Hoo hoo, what fun!

19:05.944 --> 19:09.512
I just love dashing
people's only hope.

19:09.514 --> 19:12.182
Quick!
To the generator!

19:12.184 --> 19:13.250
[snaps]

19:14.352 --> 19:17.154
My feet,
I can't move them!

19:17.156 --> 19:19.123
Man, this is straight
out of a nightmare.

19:19.125 --> 19:21.358
Now you're getting
the picture!

19:21.360 --> 19:23.360
Ah ha ha ha ha ha!

19:23.362 --> 19:25.863
Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

19:25.865 --> 19:28.865
Whoa, dude,
look out for the ropes!

19:28.867 --> 19:30.900
Ropes? What ropes?

19:30.902 --> 19:33.170
Never mind.

19:33.172 --> 19:37.874
Tell me, which sci-fi movie
inspired this nightmare?

19:37.876 --> 19:39.543
It wasn't a movie, dude.

19:39.545 --> 19:41.445
It was the time
I scarfed that pizza

19:41.447 --> 19:43.213
with peanut butter
and lobster sauce

19:43.215 --> 19:45.716
just before
I went to bed.

19:45.718 --> 19:47.217
[Donatello] grunting]

19:47.219 --> 19:49.787
I've just got to
turn off that generator.

19:49.789 --> 19:51.121
Uh!

19:52.723 --> 19:55.091
Visiting hours are over.

19:57.262 --> 19:58.728
Do something,
Master Splinter!

19:58.730 --> 19:59.997
Help us!

19:59.999 --> 20:01.765
I don't think
your rodent friend

20:01.767 --> 20:03.667
will be of much help.

20:05.170 --> 20:09.172
You see, he's rather
busy at the moment.

20:14.846 --> 20:17.848
[screeching]

20:17.850 --> 20:19.916
Major bummer, compadre.

20:19.918 --> 20:22.119
There's no way out
of this fix.

20:22.121 --> 20:24.554
Never say never,
Michelangelo.

20:24.556 --> 20:27.357
Wha--
Awesome swordplay, dude.

20:27.359 --> 20:30.093
Thanks. Now let's
get out of here!

20:32.564 --> 20:34.365
It's a bottomless chasm!

20:34.367 --> 20:37.200
Yeah. Ain't that the pits?

20:37.202 --> 20:38.168
Uh-oh!

20:38.170 --> 20:39.903
The Dream-O-Vision helmet!

20:39.905 --> 20:41.037
Oh, no!

20:41.039 --> 20:42.573
Without that thing,
we'll be stuck

20:42.575 --> 20:44.374
in this nightmare land
forever!

20:44.376 --> 20:48.378
Forever might not be
as long as you think.

20:48.380 --> 20:49.646
[groaning]

20:49.648 --> 20:50.748
What hit me?

20:50.750 --> 20:53.149
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

20:53.151 --> 20:55.886
Creepy Eddie,
you're a creep!

20:55.888 --> 20:58.889
Aw, maybe so,
but I'm here in reality,

20:58.891 --> 21:01.759
and your green friends
are there in Nightmare Land,

21:01.761 --> 21:03.527
taking my place.

21:03.529 --> 21:06.796
If the generator is destroyed
while putting out full power--

21:06.798 --> 21:09.065
[ticking]
the exchange
will be permanent!

21:09.067 --> 21:13.536
And that will be precisely
three minutes from now!

21:13.538 --> 21:16.774
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

21:17.842 --> 21:19.309
Well, one good thing--

21:19.311 --> 21:22.079
at least nothing worse
could happen to us.

21:22.081 --> 21:25.149
[rumbling]
[Both]
Whoa!

21:26.484 --> 21:29.553
It's a lucky thing
Donatello isn't here.

21:29.555 --> 21:30.888
Why is it lucky?

21:30.890 --> 21:33.123
Because I'm sure
the dude would've said,

21:33.125 --> 21:37.061
"I told you sooooo!"

21:38.863 --> 21:40.597
Yoo-hoo. Guys?

21:40.599 --> 21:41.899
Where are you?

21:41.901 --> 21:44.101
And why is it
so dark in here?

21:44.103 --> 21:45.903
[electricity sizzles]
Oh, great.

21:45.905 --> 21:47.738
Now the fuse blew.

21:47.740 --> 21:49.473
Whoa!

21:49.475 --> 21:51.407
Yowww!

21:54.212 --> 21:56.880
[Raphael]
Leonardo, Michelangelo!

21:56.882 --> 21:58.882
You're back!
[groans]

21:58.884 --> 22:00.684
Oh, no!

22:00.686 --> 22:02.219
This can't be!

22:02.221 --> 22:05.756
I'm fading back
to Nightmare Land!

22:05.758 --> 22:08.825
And here's a little
going-away gift.

22:10.862 --> 22:14.431
Oh, no!

22:17.468 --> 22:19.002
I rushed right over.

22:19.004 --> 22:20.938
What on earth
is going on here?

22:20.940 --> 22:23.306
Well, let's just say
we had a...bad dream.

22:23.308 --> 22:25.809
But thanks to your
short-circuiting
the fuse box,

22:25.811 --> 22:27.144
we're wide awake now.

22:27.146 --> 22:29.480
If you guys think
you had a bad day,

22:29.482 --> 22:31.047
you should meet Milton.

22:32.183 --> 22:34.985
Mm! Popcorn pizza.

22:34.987 --> 22:37.354
Now this is what I call
a special treat.

22:37.356 --> 22:39.823
And a special video
to go with it.

22:39.825 --> 22:42.526
Another sci-fi
creature feature?

22:42.528 --> 22:44.227
Oh, no way, dude.

22:44.229 --> 22:46.129
This one's a documentary.

22:46.131 --> 22:49.266
<i>The Undersea World</i>
<i>of Pierre Gousteau.</i>

22:49.268 --> 22:51.668
A wise decision,
Michelangelo.

22:51.670 --> 22:54.371
It sounds
most informative.
Aah!

22:54.373 --> 22:56.707
Waaah!

22:56.709 --> 22:58.475
You think we ought
to watch it now

22:58.477 --> 23:00.644
or wait till
Michelangelo gets back?

23:00.646 --> 23:03.380
Aah!

23:03.382 --> 23:06.683
Somehow I think
we've got a long wait.
