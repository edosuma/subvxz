your favorite thing

01:42.930 --> 01:47.037
about doing this play here at

01:47.141 --> 01:49.281
Honestly, there's nothing I like

01:49.385 --> 01:50.800
about being here at this hotel.

01:50.903 --> 01:52.664
Let alone having
something I like most.

paying us pretty well.

02:03.088 --> 02:04.341

02:04.365 --> 02:05.918
I have a lot of respect for him.

02:06.022 --> 02:08.335
He's taken a
classic, like Faust,

02:08.437 --> 02:11.234
and put this modern twist on it.

02:11.338 --> 02:14.237
He's made it relatable for
even millennials, you know?

02:14.341 --> 02:17.999
It's literally God
versus the devil,

02:18.103 --> 02:20.726

09:55.733 --> 09:57.676
You can have about 15-20
boxes, how big is your van?

09:57.700 --> 09:58.528
[LAUGHING]

09:58.632 --> 09:59.782
We're not moving that anyway.

09:59.806 --> 10:00.496
- Okay, good.
- You'd be doing me

10:00.600 --> 10:01.600
a big favor.

10:01.670 --> 10:03.050
Sounds good.

10:03.154 --> 10:05.087
Anyway, this room is
gonna be the most popular

10:05.190 --> 10:07.848
set for the audience, I
think, along with the bar

10:07.952 --> 10:08.998
which is actually...
[ELECTRICAL SWITCHES FLIPPING]

10:09.022 --> 10:10.989
[VANESSA] Whoa.

10:11.093 --> 10:12.301
Jeff, what's going on?

10:12.404 --> 10:13.761
[JEFF] I'm still
here, don't freak out.

10:13.785 --> 10:14.900
- Okay, I'm not freaking out.
- Power's been spotty

10:14.924 --> 10:16.339
for the past few days,

10:16.443 --> 10:20.102
it usually comes back on
in about 10 seconds or so.

10:20.205 --> 10:21.344
[VANESSA] Okay.

10:21.448 --> 10:22.701
[JEFF] You wanted the
Insomnia experience,

10:22.725 --> 10:23.864
here you have it.

10:23.968 --> 10:26.729
[VANESSA] Sure getting it, yeah.

10:26.833 --> 10:30.422
Here we go, like I said,
just about 10 seconds or so.

10:30.526 --> 10:33.425
Alright, so shall we...
Power went out again.

10:33.529 --> 10:34.668
Love the dark.

10:36.049 --> 10:37.913
- Thank you, Max.
- [WALKIE TALKIE CRACKLING]

10:38.016 --> 10:39.293
[SIGHING] Harvey.

10:39.397 --> 10:41.295
Harvey, what can I do for you?

10:41.399 --> 10:42.400
[HARVEY] Do for me?

10:42.503 --> 10:43.677
What can you do for me?

10:43.781 --> 10:44.999
You can make me
a size two again.

10:45.023 --> 10:46.507
But Russ, what
you can do for him

10:46.611 --> 10:48.347
is know that he's finished
and we're in the basement.

10:48.371 --> 10:49.959
He's no good with radios.

10:50.063 --> 10:51.720
Harvey's the head of
artistic operations.

10:51.823 --> 10:53.376
- Okay.
- He's also a big pain in my,

10:53.480 --> 10:54.377
wait, what, where are you?

10:54.481 --> 10:55.931
You're in the basement?

10:56.034 --> 10:57.242
[HARVEY] Aah,

10:57.346 --> 10:58.875
because he still wants
to use it in the show,

10:58.899 --> 11:00.221
because we all know
it's gonna be super safe

11:00.245 --> 11:02.420
for my actors and not
a liability at all.

11:02.523 --> 11:03.777
Did you hear my
side on your end?

11:03.801 --> 11:06.562
I just wanna make sure
that was audible, copy.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.264
Yeah, tell Russell
to meet me in the bar,

11:08.288 --> 11:09.599
I'm not going in the basement.

11:09.703 --> 11:11.740
After you meet Russell,
you'll love him.

11:11.843 --> 11:12.741
- Great.
- We'll go through Heaven.

11:12.844 --> 11:13.673
Sounds good.

11:13.776 --> 11:15.433
[SIGHING]

11:15.536 --> 11:17.435
Well, this is Heaven.

11:18.643 --> 11:20.956
If you didn't figure
it out on your own.

11:21.059 --> 11:23.019
This is where God'll make
his wager with the Devil

11:23.096 --> 11:24.994
with our angels as his witness.

11:25.098 --> 11:26.178
The white, a little cliché,

11:26.202 --> 11:28.688
but that's what Russell wants.

11:30.517 --> 11:31.637
I thought I saw something.

11:31.725 --> 11:33.140
[JEFF] Otherwise you guys can...

11:33.244 --> 11:34.141
- What?
- Someone.

11:34.245 --> 11:35.246
What's going on?

11:35.349 --> 11:37.075
What are you guys looking at?

11:37.179 --> 11:39.491
Abaddon eyes, that's
what we call it.

11:39.595 --> 11:40.907
Everybody feels like they

11:41.010 --> 11:42.505
saw something out of
the corner of their eyes

11:42.529 --> 11:44.462
or just felt like
they're being watched.

11:44.565 --> 11:45.670
It happens to all of us,

11:45.774 --> 11:47.027
just our imaginations
messing with us.

11:47.051 --> 11:49.225
[KNOCKING]

11:51.400 --> 11:52.608
Abaddon eyes.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.023
[JEFF] You coming?

11:54.127 --> 11:54.886
- Yeah, I'm coming.
- Are you sure you don't wanna

11:54.990 --> 11:55.715
just hang out?

11:55.818 --> 11:56.681
No, no.

11:56.785 --> 11:58.165
Okay, shall we?

12:00.823 --> 12:01.823
So...

12:02.549 --> 12:03.826
Oh, hey, guys.

12:03.930 --> 12:05.448
Guess where I was
in the blackout?

12:05.552 --> 12:06.622
Right fucking here.

12:06.726 --> 12:07.830
Think about that.

12:07.934 --> 12:08.624
That's why we
have a buddy system.

12:08.728 --> 12:09.452
Fuck off.

12:09.556 --> 12:11.834
All a... Okay [SIGHING].

12:11.938 --> 12:12.938
Actors.

12:14.319 --> 12:15.700
Here, makes his shit wine,

12:15.804 --> 12:18.082
and he insists on using
the damn basement.

12:18.185 --> 12:18.945
Hey, sweetie!

12:19.048 --> 12:20.153
Hey, honey!

12:20.256 --> 12:21.119
One of my least favorite
people in the world!

12:21.223 --> 12:22.017
Well, right back at ya.

12:22.120 --> 12:23.397
Where's your buddy here?

12:23.501 --> 12:24.882
Where is he?

12:24.985 --> 12:25.814
Old Russ is coming up
the stairs right about now.

12:25.917 --> 12:27.263
You can't rush perfection.

12:27.367 --> 12:29.300
Five, four, three and one.

12:29.403 --> 12:31.474
Oh, there he is, Jeff.

12:31.578 --> 12:32.717
How are you?

12:32.821 --> 12:34.074
[JEFF] How you
doing, wine-maker?

12:34.098 --> 12:35.893
Huh. Didn't see you
down in the basement.

12:35.996 --> 12:36.996
Not a peep.

12:37.066 --> 12:38.171
Look at that. [LAUGHING]

12:38.274 --> 12:39.068
- He opened it right up.
- You brought your

12:39.172 --> 12:40.449
- camera crew.
- Hi.

12:40.552 --> 12:41.415
- Hi, I'm Vanessa Shepherd.
- Russell Wynn.

12:41.519 --> 12:42.519
It's nice to meet you,

12:42.554 --> 12:43.383
- Russell.
- Pleasure to meet you.

12:43.486 --> 12:44.177
Thank you for having us here,

12:44.280 --> 12:45.626
we're really excited.

12:45.730 --> 12:47.363
So you're the new
"Morning Mysteries" girl?

12:47.387 --> 12:48.422
[VANESSA] I am.

12:48.526 --> 12:50.252
That's too bad, I liked Suzy.

12:50.355 --> 12:53.496
[ELECTRONIC CRACKLING]

12:53.600 --> 12:55.464
Don't get me wrong,
she was a total bitch,

12:55.567 --> 12:56.845
but I liked her.

12:58.432 --> 13:00.089
And don't thank me yet.

13:00.193 --> 13:01.642
[VANESSA] Why is that?

13:01.746 --> 13:02.896
Well, I'm sure you've
heard all the stories

13:02.920 --> 13:04.300
about this place.

13:04.404 --> 13:05.484
Everyone who enters
with a camera

13:05.508 --> 13:06.855
never seems to make it.

13:06.958 --> 13:08.270
Don't do that.

13:09.650 --> 13:10.893
She barely came in as it is.

13:10.997 --> 13:11.825
He's just kidding.

13:11.929 --> 13:14.276
I'm just screwing with you.

13:14.379 --> 13:16.692
Ah, well, we will try
to stay out of your way

13:16.796 --> 13:17.900
as much as possible.

13:18.004 --> 13:19.557
Just be two, no, thank you,

13:19.660 --> 13:20.385
flies on the wall.

13:20.489 --> 13:21.904
I appreciate that.

13:22.008 --> 13:23.675
I like what you've done
with "Morning Mysteries".

13:23.699 --> 13:25.228
[VANESSA] Oh, I didn't
think that you watch?

13:25.252 --> 13:26.322
[JEFF] He doesn't.

13:26.426 --> 13:27.151
[RUSS] I do.

13:27.254 --> 13:28.254
He does.

13:29.222 --> 13:30.902
And none of your
guests have disappeared,

13:30.982 --> 13:32.812
so you've got that on Suzy.

13:32.915 --> 13:34.468
That is true, thank you.

13:34.572 --> 13:35.849
Lawson, is it?

13:35.953 --> 13:37.057
[LOUIE] Louie, actually.

13:37.161 --> 13:38.265
Uh-huh [AFFIRMATIVE].

13:38.369 --> 13:39.725
[LOUIE] I'm a huge
fan of all of your shows

13:39.749 --> 13:41.613
and everything that you've done.

13:41.717 --> 13:42.822
You've got good taste.

13:42.925 --> 13:43.788
And I give you full permission

13:43.892 --> 13:46.032
to film to your heart's content.

13:46.135 --> 13:47.654
And when you follow the actors,

13:47.757 --> 13:49.449
they may moan and groan,

13:49.552 --> 13:51.761
but it's all part of the show.

13:51.865 --> 13:54.764
They're actors and they
secretly love attention.

13:54.868 --> 13:56.352
[JEFF] Yeah, it's no secret.

13:56.456 --> 13:58.907
Well, where should we start?

13:59.010 --> 14:00.149
Let's meet everyone.

14:00.253 --> 14:01.253
[JEFF] Yeah.

14:01.288 --> 14:04.050
[CROWD MURMURING]

14:08.640 --> 14:10.125
Ah, there he is.

14:11.264 --> 14:12.644
Alright, everyone.

14:12.748 --> 14:14.301
Welcome, welcome, so

14:14.405 --> 14:16.717
Vanessa and her guy, Lonnie?

14:18.271 --> 14:19.548
- Lonnie?
- Louie.

14:19.651 --> 14:21.067
Louie!

14:21.170 --> 14:23.690
They're gonna be embedded with
us for the entire duration.

14:23.793 --> 14:25.174
They'll be filming everything,

14:25.278 --> 14:26.486
so don't say anything

14:26.589 --> 14:29.144
you don't want a few
million people to hear.

14:29.247 --> 14:30.466
And I'll leave it
to you, Vanessa.

14:30.490 --> 14:31.940
Thank you.

14:32.043 --> 14:33.493
As you guys can see,

14:33.596 --> 14:35.736
we've handed a few of you
your own mini-camcorders.

14:35.840 --> 14:37.393
Why did we do this?

14:37.497 --> 14:39.430
Well, we want to
encourage you to film

14:39.533 --> 14:41.673
anything that you want.

14:41.777 --> 14:44.400
Self-taped interviews, any
fun behind-the-scenes stuff

14:44.504 --> 14:45.919
that we might miss.

14:46.023 --> 14:47.507
And when we wrap here,

14:47.610 --> 14:48.922
we'll grab everyone's cameras

14:49.026 --> 14:51.304
and incorporate that
footage into the episode.

14:51.407 --> 14:52.684
Make sense?

14:52.788 --> 14:53.988
[GREGORY] Question, Russell.

14:54.031 --> 14:54.755
- Yeah.
- What happens if we catch

14:54.859 --> 14:56.136
a ghost on camera?

14:56.240 --> 14:58.207
[LAUGHING]

14:58.311 --> 14:59.588
That's a good.

14:59.691 --> 15:01.901
Wow, great
question, really good.

15:02.004 --> 15:03.764
In your case, Gregory,

15:03.868 --> 15:06.215
you could ask it if
it's ever heard of you,

15:06.319 --> 15:07.458
if it's ever seen you,

15:07.561 --> 15:08.424
maybe seen your reel.

15:08.528 --> 15:09.356
[GREGORY] Probably has.

15:09.460 --> 15:11.324
Some of your work, perhaps.

15:11.427 --> 15:13.809
I was in that other thing
called Shakespeare In The Park,

15:13.913 --> 15:16.329
I mean, I don't know.

15:16.432 --> 15:17.675
Have you heard of it?

15:17.778 --> 15:19.125
It was a brilliant,

15:19.228 --> 15:21.196
brilliant summer
theater, thank you.

15:21.299 --> 15:22.656
[VANESSA] Which
show were you in?

15:22.680 --> 15:23.750
[ISABEL] No.

15:23.853 --> 15:24.934
- Don't, don't.
- Don't get him going.

15:24.958 --> 15:25.683
"Into The Woods",

15:25.786 --> 15:27.098
it was me and Amy Adams.

15:27.202 --> 15:29.204
You and Amy Adams?!

15:29.307 --> 15:30.999
You were like tree number three!

15:31.102 --> 15:33.001
Two people played a
tree better than you.

15:33.104 --> 15:34.450
[CROWD] Ooh.

15:34.554 --> 15:35.969
[RUSSELL] Alright, take it easy.

15:36.073 --> 15:38.144
Well, anyways, what I
really want everyone to do

15:38.247 --> 15:40.767
is just pretend that
we're not even here.

15:40.870 --> 15:43.218
If you've ever seen the
show "The Office", anyone?

15:43.321 --> 15:45.496
Okay, well, we're
like that camera crew.

15:45.599 --> 15:47.532
Just catching everything.

15:47.636 --> 15:48.878
[JANE] I hated "The Office".

15:48.982 --> 15:49.810
[MAX] It was pretty...

15:49.914 --> 15:51.019
[GREGORY] Minimalistic.

15:51.122 --> 15:52.341
[JANE] Yeah, it
didn't make any sense.

15:52.365 --> 15:53.687
Alright, they're a
pretty difficult group

15:53.711 --> 15:54.850
to keep focused.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.645
So let's stay on task, okay?

15:56.748 --> 15:58.026
[ISABEL] Wait, no.

15:58.129 --> 15:59.382
- Question, Russell?
- Yes. Mm-hmm [AFFIRMATIVE].

15:59.406 --> 16:01.443
Could we still post
on social media or?

16:01.546 --> 16:03.134
[RUSSELL] Yes,
same restrictions,

16:03.238 --> 16:04.756
keep it vague.

16:04.860 --> 16:06.551
Yes, actually, we
encourage social media.

16:06.655 --> 16:08.622
Just make sure to tag
"Morning Mysteries."

16:08.726 --> 16:10.555
Okay, so #MM?

16:10.659 --> 16:12.661
[VANESSA] Actually,
"Morning Mysteries".

16:12.764 --> 16:13.662
So not MM?

16:13.765 --> 16:14.559
[VANESSA] No.

16:14.663 --> 16:15.526
- The full...
- But I think MM

16:15.629 --> 16:16.906
sounds better, it's like food.

16:17.010 --> 16:18.149
[JANE] It's like Mm.

16:18.253 --> 16:19.806
And it keeps it vague, you know?

16:19.909 --> 16:22.084
We want it to be not vague,

16:22.188 --> 16:24.052
it's very specific,
"Morning Mysteries".

16:24.155 --> 16:24.880
[CROWD CHATTERING]

16:24.984 --> 16:26.054
She's too bossy.

16:26.157 --> 16:27.445
Right, well, this is going well.

16:27.469 --> 16:29.264
I just wanted you
guys all to meet,

16:29.367 --> 16:30.541
so here we are.

16:30.644 --> 16:32.163
- [CROWD CHATTERING]
- Bye.

16:32.267 --> 16:33.475
Thank you, thanks.

16:33.578 --> 16:34.855
[MAX] I think, Gregory...

16:34.959 --> 16:36.685
I believe we need to
go back to the city.

16:36.788 --> 16:38.894
Believe it or not, the
wine's not selling like it...

16:38.998 --> 16:40.171
