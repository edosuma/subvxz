WEBVTT

00:00.172 --> 00:02.695
And easy on the CrossFit
for a while, okay?

00:02.734 --> 00:04.295
- Okay.
- Thank you.

00:04.320 --> 00:06.875
Just cleared Treatment 3.
Just got to turn it over.

00:06.900 --> 00:09.592
- Sure.
- Man, we're up again already?

00:09.617 --> 00:11.250
- Looks like it.
- What's going on?

00:11.275 --> 00:13.046
- Who are they?
- Big brother.

00:13.071 --> 00:14.292
- Hey.
- Oh.

00:14.317 --> 00:16.571
- Up.
- JCAHO.

00:16.596 --> 00:19.936
Yeah, they're doing a
surprise site survey.

00:19.961 --> 00:22.211
- Who's JCAHO?
- The Joint Commission.

00:22.236 --> 00:23.519
They rate the performance standards

00:23.544 --> 00:24.994
of hospitals and certify them.

00:25.019 --> 00:27.193
So far, JCAHO's reports
have been positive.

00:27.218 --> 00:28.522
So let's keep it that way.

00:28.547 --> 00:31.526
Stick to protocols and with big smiles.

00:32.923 --> 00:34.122
Dr. Choi, we're gonna need

00:34.147 --> 00:36.713
some of your Navy-inspired
discipline today.

00:36.738 --> 00:38.584
Sorry, I'm with the paramedics today.

00:38.609 --> 00:40.185
- Resident ride along.
- Mm.

00:40.210 --> 00:42.882
And discipline, that a nice
way of saying I'm a tight ass?

00:42.907 --> 00:44.515
Oh, yes. Tight.

00:44.540 --> 00:47.470
- I didn't say that.
- [laughs]

00:47.668 --> 00:49.973
And, uh, getting those docs in line,

00:49.998 --> 00:52.094
isn't that? the chief
resident's job anyway?

00:52.119 --> 00:54.617
Wonderful, the guy enforcing the rules

00:54.642 --> 00:56.109
is the one who's always breaking them.

00:56.134 --> 00:57.134
Yeah.

00:57.159 --> 00:59.038
- Good luck with that.
- [chuckles]

00:59.063 --> 01:01.125
Code One team to the ED.

01:01.149 --> 01:02.546
- What do we got?
- Nathan Clay.

01:02.572 --> 01:04.739
58-year-old male. "Peeds" versus auto.

01:04.763 --> 01:06.380
GCS 12. Vitals stable.

01:06.405 --> 01:08.072
Gross deformity to the left upper arm.

01:08.097 --> 01:09.203
- Right in here.
- Ow.

01:09.228 --> 01:10.609
He's complaining of
chest and back pains.

01:10.775 --> 01:12.608
- Mr. Clay, can you hear me?
- [groaning]

01:12.633 --> 01:14.641
Mr. Clay? On my count.

01:14.666 --> 01:16.116
One, two, three.

01:16.141 --> 01:17.481
[grunts]

01:17.644 --> 01:19.446
Central line and a CVC catheter.

01:19.471 --> 01:21.579
- Right away.
- Airway's intact.

01:21.604 --> 01:23.771
- Breath sounds clear bilaterally.
- Ow!

01:23.796 --> 01:25.081
Tenderness in the left chest

01:25.106 --> 01:26.532
and thoracic spine. What happened here?

01:26.557 --> 01:28.473
He's walking with his
wife on Michigan Avenue.

01:28.498 --> 01:30.845
Suddenly flips out,
starts wailing on her.

01:30.870 --> 01:32.621
A couple of Samaritans
jumped in to help out.

01:32.646 --> 01:34.743
He takes off right into traffic.

01:34.966 --> 01:37.300
Score one for, uh, karma.

01:37.325 --> 01:39.421
12-lead EKGs, chest X-rays,

01:39.446 --> 01:41.696
CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis,

01:41.721 --> 01:43.582
with recons of the TLS spine.

01:43.607 --> 01:44.703
- On it.
- Leave me... no.

01:44.728 --> 01:45.930
Leave me alone. I'm fine.

01:45.955 --> 01:47.696
Laura Clay. 55-year-old female.

01:47.720 --> 01:48.555
- GCS 15.
- I'm fine.

01:48.580 --> 01:49.438
I need to get to my husband.

01:49.463 --> 01:50.672
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am.

01:50.697 --> 01:52.456
- Okay.
- Heart rate's tachycardic.

01:52.481 --> 01:53.846
This is all my fault.

01:53.870 --> 01:57.297
Look, I blocked my fall with
my hand, not my C spine.

01:57.322 --> 01:58.563
I'm neurologically intact.

01:58.588 --> 01:59.787
Technical. Are you a doctor?

01:59.812 --> 02:03.138
- Yes, yes, I am.
- Laura! Please...

02:03.163 --> 02:05.008
- Dr. Rhodes!
- Honey, I'm here.

02:05.033 --> 02:07.171
- Ma'am, stay right there.
- I'm right here.

02:07.196 --> 02:09.056
There are too many of them! [crying]

02:09.082 --> 02:10.500
- I'm here, my love!
- Help me!

02:10.551 --> 02:13.376
2... I need restraints. 2
of Versed and 5 of Haldol.

02:13.401 --> 02:14.507
- There are too many of th...
- No, not Haldol!

02:14.532 --> 02:16.614
Quetiapine. He's not abusive.

02:16.639 --> 02:19.020
He has Lewy Body Dementia.

02:19.045 --> 02:22.174
Wait, scratch the
Haldol. 25 of quetiapine.

02:22.199 --> 02:23.359
- Laura!
- It's all right, my love.

02:23.384 --> 02:25.084
What the hell's Lewy Body?

02:25.109 --> 02:27.069
Debilitating form of dementia.

02:27.094 --> 02:30.589
Alzheimer's meets Parkinson's.

02:33.757 --> 02:37.957
- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -
- www.addic7ed.com -

02:39.601 --> 02:41.402
He took a pretty good whack.

02:41.427 --> 02:43.772
He's got a chest bruise,
left first rib fracture,

02:43.797 --> 02:45.413
proximal humerus fracture.

02:45.465 --> 02:47.582
- How are his labs?
- It's all good.

02:47.626 --> 02:49.474
Calcium was elevated.

02:49.499 --> 02:51.552
I suspect he'll develop a
kidney stone down the road,

02:51.588 --> 02:53.825
but it's likely he's had a few before.

02:53.850 --> 02:55.202
Prior heart surgery?

02:55.341 --> 02:57.475
Says it was a quadruple bypass.

02:57.510 --> 02:59.374
Had it done at Northwestern
five years ago.

02:59.399 --> 03:02.290
- He remembers the details?
- Yeah, he's lucid.

03:02.315 --> 03:05.756
Somewhat. All right, EKG is normal,

03:05.781 --> 03:07.447
but because of the prior heart surgery,

03:07.468 --> 03:09.126
I'm gonna repeat it every few hours.

03:09.151 --> 03:11.201
He's all yours.

03:13.122 --> 03:14.788
Mr. Clay?

03:14.813 --> 03:17.484
Mr. Clay, I'm Dr. Charles.
How are you feeling?

03:17.509 --> 03:19.643
My wife, Laura, where is she?

03:19.730 --> 03:23.139
She's being treated right
now, but will be in shortly.

03:23.164 --> 03:27.208
I hurt her again, didn't
I? [breathing heavily]

03:27.705 --> 03:32.561
This isn't the life she deserves.

03:34.297 --> 03:36.130
Mr. Clay?

03:36.155 --> 03:38.990
Mr. Clay?

03:44.165 --> 03:47.299
Damn, you got the
online thing down, huh?

03:47.335 --> 03:49.426
- There was a time.
- Yeah, what's her name?

03:49.451 --> 03:50.950
Easy. She's taken.

03:50.975 --> 03:52.925
Vicki. Doctor at the VA.

03:52.950 --> 03:54.171
Oh, man.

03:54.196 --> 03:55.612
There are so many female paramedics

03:55.637 --> 03:57.720
who are gonna be sorry to
hear you're off the market.

03:57.745 --> 03:59.124
Couple guys, too.

03:59.149 --> 04:00.216
Well, you let 'em down easy for me.

04:00.241 --> 04:01.290
All right.

04:01.315 --> 04:02.565
You sure you gonna be okay back here?

04:02.590 --> 04:04.083
'Cause we can just throw
Desmond in the back.

04:04.108 --> 04:05.409
Eh, I'm fine.

04:05.434 --> 04:07.343
Ambo's like the Humvee.
You sit where there's room.

04:07.368 --> 04:09.703
- Comfort's not a factor.
- Well, good.

04:09.728 --> 04:10.974
This day's gonna go by quick then.

04:10.999 --> 04:14.041
Ambo 61, 40-year-old
male down in his home.

04:14.066 --> 04:15.755
222 Bromley Avenue.

04:15.780 --> 04:17.531
Some kind of lower extremity insult.

04:17.555 --> 04:19.305
He's in severe pain, possibly trapped.

04:19.329 --> 04:21.197
Copy Main. Ambo 61 responding.

04:21.221 --> 04:23.436
All right, we're on!

04:25.693 --> 04:29.355
[siren wailing]

04:29.670 --> 04:30.886
It doesn't make any sense.

04:30.911 --> 04:32.558
I've had Boomer since he was a puppy.

04:32.583 --> 04:34.466
He's super loyal. I leave
the room for a second,

04:34.491 --> 04:35.749
he's looking for me.

04:35.774 --> 04:37.003
I had a dog like that.

04:37.028 --> 04:39.543
He might nip a little, but
this was a full-on attack.

04:39.568 --> 04:42.027
In my experience, dogs
can be unpredictable.

04:42.052 --> 04:44.091
Even really friendly ones.

04:44.116 --> 04:45.953
Sometimes if a dog's
in pain, though, he...

04:45.978 --> 04:46.968
He wasn't.

04:47.025 --> 04:50.059
We were playing tug of
war, like we always do.

04:50.197 --> 04:52.134
Dog bites shouldn't be stitched.

04:52.159 --> 04:53.725
They need to stay open

04:53.750 --> 04:55.827
so the wound doesn't become infected.

04:55.852 --> 04:57.870
Also, I'm gonna give you a tetanus shot

04:57.895 --> 04:59.035
and an antibiotic.

04:59.060 --> 05:00.676
Boomer's healthy. He's
had all his shots.

05:00.701 --> 05:02.701
It's just a precaution.

05:03.964 --> 05:05.473
[inhales sharply]

05:12.398 --> 05:15.921
[indistinct radio chatter]

05:16.992 --> 05:18.647
Paul's in trouble down there.

05:18.672 --> 05:21.373
- Did you call 911?
- Yes, I'm his neighbor.

05:22.735 --> 05:24.735
Paul?

05:24.900 --> 05:26.700
It's the paramedics.

05:29.848 --> 05:32.516
- Ooh.
- Ooh, that's ripe.

05:33.095 --> 05:35.890
Man, look at this. He's a hoarder.

05:41.127 --> 05:43.318
[groans]

05:43.460 --> 05:44.959
What do you think?

05:45.213 --> 05:46.644
You good going in there?

05:46.669 --> 05:48.460
- I'm good.
- Okay.

05:48.485 --> 05:50.196
Uh, get the truck company here.

05:50.221 --> 05:51.484
Tell 'em they're gonna
have to help dig us out,

05:51.509 --> 05:52.575
and grab me a second radio.

05:52.600 --> 05:54.027
And, uh, I'm gonna try and
go in through the back door.

05:54.052 --> 05:55.802
You got it.

06:01.945 --> 06:03.702
Paul!

06:03.727 --> 06:06.233
Everything okay?

06:07.438 --> 06:09.537
[quietly] Okay.

06:10.571 --> 06:13.028
[grunting]

06:15.908 --> 06:17.897
Third squad caught a high-rise fire.

06:17.922 --> 06:20.256
Dispatch is pulling a truck
from up north to help us out.

06:20.281 --> 06:22.696
It'll be a while before they get here.

06:23.236 --> 06:25.101
[grunts]

06:25.126 --> 06:28.682
In the beginning, I wanted
to think it would pass.

06:28.707 --> 06:31.658
Any wife would, but
I'm also a neurologist,

06:31.683 --> 06:34.851
and I couldn't ignore his symptoms.

06:34.876 --> 06:37.471
Oh, so you diagnosed
the Lewy Body Dementia?

06:37.496 --> 06:40.149
Yes, but I got second
and third opinions,

06:40.174 --> 06:42.285
and they both agreed it was LBD,

06:42.310 --> 06:44.059
and that was about four years ago.

06:44.102 --> 06:46.753
Four years, really?

06:46.777 --> 06:49.421
You know, Nathan expressed
deep regret to me

06:49.446 --> 06:50.945
about the pain that he's caused you.

06:50.970 --> 06:52.411
That kind of insight is rare

06:52.436 --> 06:54.768
for somebody who's been
battling LBD for that long.

06:55.123 --> 06:58.338
Well, my husband was an engineer,

06:58.363 --> 07:00.947
and his brain is wired
to solve problems.

07:00.972 --> 07:02.768
Last year, I retired early.

07:02.793 --> 07:05.698
I wanted to devote more time
to his cognitive therapy.

07:05.777 --> 07:07.498
Hmm, well, it's been working.

07:07.522 --> 07:09.011
There's moments when he's lucid.

07:09.036 --> 07:12.433
But more and more, it's this.

07:12.458 --> 07:13.973
Mrs. Clay,

07:14.156 --> 07:17.516
Nathan's latest EKG is still normal.

07:17.541 --> 07:19.772
I want to do another one in a few hours,

07:19.797 --> 07:22.548
but if it is good too,
I'll discharge him.

07:22.573 --> 07:25.138
- Thank you, doctor.
- Mm-hmm.

07:28.126 --> 07:32.251
I know that it would be better
and safer for the both of us

07:32.276 --> 07:35.381
if Nathan went to a care facility,

07:35.406 --> 07:38.587
but if I do that, then it's over.

07:39.637 --> 07:41.911
And I'm not ready to give up our Sundays

07:41.936 --> 07:43.846
listening to opera.

07:43.913 --> 07:47.832
I know it's hard to imagine,
but my Nathan is still in there.

07:48.038 --> 07:52.196
Last week he made me
dinner, Florentine lasagna.

07:52.298 --> 07:53.993
He can still cook?

07:54.018 --> 07:57.330
Well, meals take longer to
prepare than they used to,

07:57.731 --> 07:59.765
but...

08:00.282 --> 08:02.282
he does it for me.

08:04.880 --> 08:07.598
He's fighting just as hard as I am.

08:12.326 --> 08:14.543
Hi, honey.

08:16.631 --> 08:18.998
Everything's gonna be okay.

08:19.023 --> 08:21.273
Everything's okay.

08:23.501 --> 08:25.027
How you doing, Ethan?

08:25.211 --> 08:28.212
Fine, as long as I
breathe through my mouth.

08:28.237 --> 08:29.934
Is it as tight in
there as I think it is?

08:29.959 --> 08:31.644
- It's worse.
- [clears throat]

08:31.669 --> 08:33.330
Are you claustrophobic?

08:33.361 --> 08:35.756
Didn't used to be.

08:41.102 --> 08:43.293
I mean, and Tate totally snores,

08:43.318 --> 08:45.151
but I don't mind.

08:45.177 --> 08:48.668
Oh, he does this thing where
he shoots his dirty boxers

08:48.693 --> 08:51.767
into the hamper like a buzzer beater.

08:52.514 --> 08:54.093
Anyway, it's cute.

08:54.118 --> 08:56.193
Oh, my God.

08:56.294 --> 08:58.061
You're in love.

08:58.700 --> 09:01.618
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What's that?

09:01.643 --> 09:03.294
What's what?

09:03.799 --> 09:07.110
Used gloves go in the
bio bin, not the trash.

09:07.135 --> 09:08.434
Okay, those were actually clean though.

09:08.509 --> 09:10.142
- They were on the floor.
- Probably just got stuck

09:10.167 --> 09:11.591
to the pair that came out before them.

09:11.616 --> 09:14.150
Unless you're certain, it's bio.

09:14.175 --> 09:15.895
Come on, Maggie. You know the protocol.

09:15.920 --> 09:17.054
I do.

09:17.080 --> 09:18.592
I've also been through this circus

09:18.617 --> 09:19.650
about a dozen times.

09:19.675 --> 09:21.958
JCAHO days are about patient care,

09:21.983 --> 09:24.077
not about a pair of latex gloves.

09:24.375 --> 09:27.770
Look, I'm already in the
doghouse with Goodwin.

09:27.795 --> 09:30.241
If there's any chance of
getting out, I want it.

09:30.266 --> 09:34.586
So by the book... by the book.

09:34.610 --> 09:36.250
By the book.

09:36.368 --> 09:38.256
[sighs]

09:40.487 --> 09:43.021
Okay honey, eight across.

09:43.214 --> 09:44.604
It's five letters

09:44.629 --> 09:47.678
and the clue is rental agreement,

09:47.703 --> 09:50.337
and the first letter is L.

09:55.022 --> 09:57.904
I'm thinking the second is E.

09:58.258 --> 10:02.315
L-E...

10:02.998 --> 10:04.581
Lease.

10:04.641 --> 10:07.509
Good. Good, honey.

10:07.534 --> 10:08.944
All right, next one.

10:08.969 --> 10:11.459
We're gonna do 23 down.

10:11.484 --> 10:12.933
Six letters.

10:13.047 --> 10:14.547
- The clue is collects...
- [rapid beeping]

10:14.572 --> 10:15.521
With an S.

10:15.546 --> 10:18.232
[beeping continues]

10:18.257 --> 10:19.670
- What happened?
- I don't know.

10:19.695 --> 10:22.059
His blood pressure tanked.

10:22.211 --> 10:24.084
All right, bag and hang a liter bolus.

10:24.109 --> 10:25.392
- Yes, doctor.
- SATS are dropping.

10:25.417 --> 10:27.840
- Intubate?
- Yep.

10:28.407 --> 10:32.515
Grab the bag and hook it up to the O2.

10:32.849 --> 10:35.003
All right, 20 of etomidate. 100 of sux.

10:35.028 --> 10:36.053
Let's bring in the FAST scan.

10:36.078 --> 10:38.968
- April, give me some pressure.
- Here, doctor.

10:42.445 --> 10:45.069
And I'm in.

10:45.330 --> 10:46.996
- Got it.
- Okay.

10:47.021 --> 10:49.679
- Scan.
- Here you go.

10:52.489 --> 10:54.962
Heart rate 110.

10:57.686 --> 11:00.576
All right, belly's clean.

11:00.810 --> 11:03.800
Poor wall motion of the
LV and a small effusion.

11:03.825 --> 11:05.681
He's bleeding internally?

11:05.706 --> 11:07.656
Dr. Charles.

11:08.175 --> 11:09.377
Mrs. Clay, please, right over here.

11:09.402 --> 11:10.485
SATS are back up.

11:10.647 --> 11:12.025
Oxygenation improving.

11:12.050 --> 11:13.989
It's not gonna matter if he
goes into cardiac arrest.

11:14.014 --> 11:15.754
CT of the heart and great vessels.

11:15.779 --> 11:17.612
Let's get him ready to go.

11:21.194 --> 11:22.912
Laura?

11:22.947 --> 11:24.780
If we may?

11:28.136 --> 11:29.802
The blunt trauma from the car accident

11:29.827 --> 11:32.578
displaced one of Nathan's bypass grafts.

11:32.607 --> 11:34.941
His aorta is leaking blood.

11:34.976 --> 11:37.021
- A pseudo-aneurysm.
- Mm-hmm.

11:37.046 --> 11:38.629
How bad?

11:38.874 --> 11:41.124
Right now it's just a slow drip.

11:41.149 --> 11:42.532
It hasn't ruptured yet.

11:42.557 --> 11:44.716
So there's still an opportunity

11:44.741 --> 11:46.241
to operate, repair the suture line,

11:46.266 --> 11:47.382
and plug the hole?

11:47.407 --> 11:48.809
Normally, yes.

11:48.834 --> 11:51.435
Your husband's prior
heart bypass surgery

11:51.582 --> 11:55.146
significantly increases the
difficulty of the operation.

11:55.264 --> 11:58.486
His odds of surviving
the procedure plummet.

11:58.511 --> 12:01.896
So if surgery isn't a
viable option, what is?

12:06.211 --> 12:08.261
Given the circumstances,

12:08.444 --> 12:10.861
we feel the safest choice

12:10.934 --> 12:13.602
is to make Nathan comfortable.

12:17.519 --> 12:19.102
How long?

12:19.146 --> 12:21.089
We can't be certain.

12:21.234 --> 12:23.651
A day, a week,

12:23.734 --> 12:25.484
maybe a few months

12:25.581 --> 12:27.664
until the aneurysm ruptures.

12:27.800 --> 12:29.800
We're very sorry.

12:33.631 --> 12:35.968
Help. I can't move.

12:35.993 --> 12:38.460
I'm coming, Paul.

12:43.980 --> 12:46.390
Don't touch that!

12:46.415 --> 12:48.330
What was that?

12:54.028 --> 12:55.861
[exhales]

12:57.512 --> 12:59.285
Ah!

12:59.310 --> 13:01.066
[grunts]

13:01.913 --> 13:04.065
Ethan, what happened?

13:04.090 --> 13:07.056
Got bit by the lid of a tin can.

13:09.785 --> 13:11.489
Truck company is almost here.

13:11.514 --> 13:14.065
They're going to clear a path
to get the stretcher through.

13:16.898 --> 13:18.531
Please, hurry!

13:18.556 --> 13:20.784
Hold on, Paul!

13:20.809 --> 13:22.608
Oh, thank God.

13:23.194 --> 13:25.828
I haven't been able to
pee in over 16 hours.

13:25.853 --> 13:27.519
I thought I was gonna explode.

13:27.629 --> 13:29.495
Brachytherapy for prostate cancer?

13:29.520 --> 13:30.736
Two days ago.

13:30.761 --> 13:32.740
My urologist said it was the way to go.

13:32.765 --> 13:33.970
Who's your urologist?

13:33.995 --> 13:35.878
I'll call and tell them
you've experienced a blockage.

13:35.903 --> 13:37.903
Dr. Mason, over at Advocate South.

13:37.928 --> 13:39.741
Uh, contact info's, uh, in my phone

13:39.766 --> 13:41.933
in my pants pocket.

13:43.676 --> 13:45.280
Oh, sorry.

13:45.305 --> 13:48.822
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:48.848 --> 13:50.440
Everything okay?

13:50.464 --> 13:52.748
Just a little spill. I got it.

13:52.773 --> 13:53.999
Okay, hold on.

13:54.024 --> 13:56.522
I'll call environmental services
and have them send a janitor.

13:56.547 --> 13:57.366
It's just pee.

13:57.391 --> 13:58.673
I've cleaned it a thousand times.

13:58.698 --> 14:00.663
Yeah, but not with JCAHO
and Robocop Halstead

14:00.688 --> 14:01.803
on the prowl.

14:01.828 --> 14:04.029
By the book, remember?

14:04.054 --> 14:05.362
Oh, man.

14:05.387 --> 14:08.390
I think the seed came out.
It's radioactive, right?

14:08.415 --> 14:10.838
Oh, it did.

14:10.902 --> 14:13.263
Okay, I'll call Urology instead.

14:19.353 --> 14:21.673
Cath lab for a cardio angiogram?

14:21.698 --> 14:24.696
Should give a better view
of Nathan's pseudo-aneurysm

14:24.721 --> 14:27.389
and hopefully help me estimate
a timeline for his wife.

14:27.414 --> 14:29.581
You mind grabbing me an MRI of his head

14:29.606 --> 14:30.822
while you're up there?

14:30.847 --> 14:31.976
Brain scan?

14:32.106 --> 14:33.536
His injuries don't necessitate it.

14:33.561 --> 14:35.301
It's not for him. It's for me.

14:35.326 --> 14:37.278
Uh, Dr. Charles.

14:37.303 --> 14:40.938
Dr. Rhodes, his awareness
and gross motor skills

14:41.111 --> 14:42.744
are just too strong

14:42.780 --> 14:45.981
for somebody who's been
battling LBD as long as he has.

14:46.006 --> 14:49.565
No amount of cognitive therapy
in the world is gonna outthink

14:49.590 --> 14:51.928
this disease to the degree
that he appears to be.

14:51.953 --> 14:55.071
Laura and two other neurologists

14:55.096 --> 14:57.303
have all agreed on the
Lewy Body diagnosis.

14:57.328 --> 14:59.245
- You think they're wrong?
- I don't know what to think.

14:59.270 --> 15:01.044
That's why I need the scan.

15:01.130 --> 15:03.060
I need the wife's consent.

15:03.085 --> 15:04.916
Hasn't she been through enough?

15:04.941 --> 15:07.670
I'm just trying to spare
her some false hope here.

15:07.694 --> 15:08.940
- Um.
- Hello.

15:08.966 --> 15:10.799
- Gentlemen.
- Doctors.

15:10.824 --> 15:12.194
JCAHO day isn't exactly the time

15:12.219 --> 15:15.220
to be sneaking in unauthorized tests.

15:15.302 --> 15:16.919
I don't know what to tell you.

15:17.038 --> 15:19.132
- Okay.
- Thanks, pal.

15:19.157 --> 15:20.323
Mm.

15:21.360 --> 15:24.477
[siren beeps]

15:28.930 --> 15:30.980
- What've we got?
- [indistinct chatter]

15:31.014 --> 15:33.282
Hey, guys, start clearing out!

15:33.307 --> 15:35.280
[indistinct radio chatter]

15:35.555 --> 15:37.102
Don't touch that.

15:37.174 --> 15:38.414
Get away.

15:38.439 --> 15:40.055
- Get away.
- There's a second person.

15:40.080 --> 15:41.870
I'm hearing another victim.

15:42.414 --> 15:45.077
Ethan, the neighbors seem
sure it's only Paul in there.

15:45.102 --> 15:47.245
Don't touch that!

15:47.270 --> 15:50.157
There's someone else here.

15:50.345 --> 15:52.574
Dr. Perrington,

15:54.758 --> 15:57.422
got a hemoptysis patient.

15:57.447 --> 16:00.921
Chest X-ray says it's a COPD,
but I think he needs a bronch.

16:00.946 --> 16:02.766
You want to take a quick look?

16:02.992 --> 16:03.985
Really?

16:04.010 --> 16:07.109
The esteemed Dr. Halstead
needs my help with a patient.

16:07.134 --> 16:08.748
I'm honored.

16:09.700 --> 16:12.797
Look, I, uh... I'm sorry about
what happened the other day.

16:12.822 --> 16:16.492
You want a consult, page my resident.

16:22.188 --> 16:24.717
Okay, no redness, no inflammation.

16:24.742 --> 16:25.825
Looks good.

16:25.850 --> 16:27.266
So I can go?

16:27.291 --> 16:29.775
The nurses are working on your
discharge paperwork right now.

16:29.800 --> 16:32.330
Your wound should heal in
about seven days or so.

16:32.355 --> 16:35.773
Until then, irrigate them
and keep them covered.

16:37.022 --> 16:39.627
You all right? Oh, just itchy

16:39.652 --> 16:41.347
and a little sweaty.

16:41.372 --> 16:43.234
Mind if I take a look?

16:44.589 --> 16:46.131
No rash.

16:46.156 --> 16:48.891
Could be an allergic
reaction to the antibiotics.

16:49.266 --> 16:52.188
- You do feel warm though.
- I'll get a temp.

16:52.213 --> 16:53.614
[phone vibrates and chimes]

16:53.639 --> 16:56.157
Oh, my sister checking in.

16:56.182 --> 16:57.768
I left Boomer with her.

16:57.792 --> 17:00.075
- She's not a dog person either.
- [chuckles softly]

17:00.100 --> 17:02.102
I get the impression
they're not for you.

17:02.127 --> 17:03.227
I've treated a lot of dog wounds,

17:03.252 --> 17:05.135
especially on kids.

17:05.378 --> 17:08.380
It's 99.4. Was normal at intake.

17:09.161 --> 17:11.258
- CBC and CMP?
- Yeah.

17:11.282 --> 17:14.094
- I'm not out of here, am I?
- Sorry.

17:14.118 --> 17:16.202
Itching and fever, even a low one,

17:16.227 --> 17:18.403
could be more than an allergic reaction.

17:18.539 --> 17:20.642
Someone will be with you shortly.

17:23.756 --> 17:26.611
Paul, is there anyone else in the house?

17:26.636 --> 17:28.404
No, no, it's just me.

17:28.429 --> 17:29.834
You've got to hurry!

17:29.859 --> 17:32.450
Ah! Ah!

17:32.864 --> 17:35.448
Ethan, what happened?

17:35.473 --> 17:36.938
Are you okay?

17:36.963 --> 17:39.047
[grunting]

17:39.680 --> 17:41.306
[plane flying overhead]

17:41.331 --> 17:42.770
[explosion]

17:42.795 --> 17:44.759
[gunfire]

17:44.783 --> 17:47.145
[groaning]

17:47.506 --> 17:48.989
Ahh!

17:49.014 --> 17:50.752
[hyperventilating]

17:50.777 --> 17:53.179
[gunfire]

17:58.985 --> 18:01.236
- What's all this?
- Well, it's pretty clear

18:01.261 --> 18:02.968
an attending job at
Med isn't gonna happen.

18:02.993 --> 18:04.276
You don't know that.

18:04.301 --> 18:05.793
Just being realistic.

18:05.942 --> 18:07.408
Perrington's on the hiring committee.

18:07.433 --> 18:08.649
She hates me.

18:08.758 --> 18:10.424
Not to mention Goodwin.

18:10.449 --> 18:12.466
But really, Miami, Will?

18:12.620 --> 18:15.977
I've seen you sunburn walking
from the ED to your car.

18:16.375 --> 18:18.955
Hey, got to go where the jobs are.

18:21.907 --> 18:24.059
No coffee. JCAHO day.

18:24.303 --> 18:26.289
Right.

18:28.000 --> 18:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

18:35.367 --> 18:36.616
I don't understand.

18:36.641 --> 18:39.086
There should be atrophy,
heavy degeneration,

18:39.112 --> 18:40.821
tangled cells in the white matter.

18:40.846 --> 18:41.928
When was this taken?

18:41.980 --> 18:43.239
About an hour ago.

18:43.327 --> 18:44.559
I'm sorry. I had a hunch.

18:44.584 --> 18:45.833
I rushed it. I really should have...

18:45.858 --> 18:47.494
That is a healthy brain.

18:47.519 --> 18:50.603
There's no disease. This means that...

18:50.628 --> 18:52.662
Nathan doesn't have Lewy Body Dementia.

18:52.687 --> 18:54.359
He has the symptoms.

18:54.384 --> 18:57.121
Keeps getting worse.
Practically a textbook case.

18:57.146 --> 18:58.443
How?

18:58.468 --> 19:01.633
Take a look at this cross
section we took during the MRI.

19:01.658 --> 19:03.830
Notice the adenoma,

19:03.905 --> 19:06.922
benign tumor, in the parathyroid gland.

19:06.955 --> 19:09.852
So you think this is all
hormonal irregularity?

19:09.877 --> 19:11.601
Elevated parathyroid hormone

19:11.626 --> 19:13.461
is consistent with increased calcium

19:13.486 --> 19:15.605
and cognitive impairment.
Nathan has both.

19:15.630 --> 19:17.491
Yes, but he also has hallucinations,

19:17.516 --> 19:19.466
physical aggression. You don't see that

19:19.491 --> 19:21.691
in patients with hyperparathyroidism.

19:21.747 --> 19:24.705
That's where his recent bypass
surgery makes him unique, okay?

19:24.730 --> 19:27.352
The beta blocker he's
been taking ever since

19:27.392 --> 19:30.516
causes increased levels
of violent behavior

19:30.541 --> 19:32.322
in a select amount of patients.

19:32.501 --> 19:35.616
Oh, my God.

19:37.567 --> 19:40.420
A hormonal imbalance

19:40.843 --> 19:43.313
with a medication side effect.

19:43.338 --> 19:45.292
[exhales]

19:45.606 --> 19:47.876
Why didn't I see that?

19:47.901 --> 19:50.118
The clues were right in front of me.

19:50.350 --> 19:53.533
Because they mimic the symptoms

19:53.558 --> 19:56.203
of Lewy Body Dementia to a T,

19:56.374 --> 19:59.032
and four years ago that adenoma
would have been so small

19:59.057 --> 20:00.588
no scan could have caught it.

20:00.613 --> 20:01.998
Look, I'm just telling you

20:02.023 --> 20:04.381
that presented with the same evidence,

32:32.128 --> 32:33.316
We're out of the woods.

32:33.341 --> 32:34.840
Not yet.

32:34.865 --> 32:37.252
I want to check his other bypass grafts.

32:37.489 --> 32:39.638
Something goes wrong in the future,

32:39.663 --> 32:44.455
no surgeon's gonna open
his chest a third time.

32:48.190 --> 32:50.830
Lymphoma.

32:52.063 --> 32:54.438
I have cancer?

32:55.166 --> 32:59.238
The next step is a biopsy to
determine exactly which kind.

32:59.263 --> 33:01.123
But I'm only 26.

33:01.148 --> 33:02.615
I go to the gym every day.

33:02.640 --> 33:03.803
I don't smoke.

33:03.828 --> 33:04.861
I know.

33:04.886 --> 33:06.031
It's not fair.

33:06.056 --> 33:07.415
But I don't feel sick.

33:07.440 --> 33:09.773
Well, that's because
it was caught early.

33:09.829 --> 33:12.124
You have time to get way ahead of this.

33:12.149 --> 33:13.453
Mm-hmm.

33:13.478 --> 33:16.794
The lymph nodes are
around here, aren't they?

33:17.404 --> 33:19.928
Boomer's been nipping at me for a month.

33:19.953 --> 33:22.002
Always right there.

33:22.820 --> 33:24.834
Do you think he knew?

33:25.120 --> 33:26.962
Maybe.

33:27.005 --> 33:31.426
It seems some dogs can smell cancers,

33:31.451 --> 33:33.501
even in the very early stages.

33:33.526 --> 33:36.266
- Yeah, he wasn't attacking you.
- [sighs]

33:36.336 --> 33:39.581
He was trying to protect you.

33:42.211 --> 33:45.410
[laughs softly]

33:49.368 --> 33:51.191
Maggie, what's going
on with Treatment 4?

33:51.216 --> 33:54.204
- We don't have the space for this...
- I know, I know. It's been all day.

33:54.229 --> 33:56.999
Dr. Halstead, environmental
services hasn't shown up yet.

33:57.024 --> 33:59.071
I can't even get an estimate
as to when they will.

33:59.954 --> 34:01.976
[sighs] I'll go see them in person.

34:02.001 --> 34:03.834
I'll drag someone down
here if I have to.

34:03.859 --> 34:04.975
Knock some heads.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.333
I need that room back.

34:17.237 --> 34:19.429
How's he doing?

34:20.161 --> 34:21.710
Well.

34:21.735 --> 34:23.885
Good.

34:24.685 --> 34:27.103
How are you doing?

34:27.222 --> 34:29.554
As a neurologist,

34:29.760 --> 34:32.821
Lewy Body Dementia was
my worst nightmare.

34:32.853 --> 34:35.619
I'd seen so many cases,

34:35.762 --> 34:37.770
and I'm wondering

34:38.045 --> 34:40.382
if it influenced my diagnosis.

34:40.408 --> 34:41.719
Hmm.

34:42.656 --> 34:47.018
Medicine, you know.

34:47.281 --> 34:49.571
Imperfect science.

34:49.596 --> 34:51.513
Practiced by human beings, no less.

34:51.538 --> 34:53.233
[sniffles]

34:54.150 --> 34:57.919
Four years we could have been doing CTs,

34:58.329 --> 35:01.452
but I had an answer,
so there was no reason

35:01.477 --> 35:04.968
to continue radiating his brain.

35:04.993 --> 35:07.352
I robbed Nathan

35:07.377 --> 35:09.288
of his mind.

35:10.135 --> 35:12.636
I imprisoned him.

35:14.860 --> 35:16.901
I drained our savings.

35:16.926 --> 35:18.586
Squandered our time together,

35:18.611 --> 35:21.701
time that we can never get back.

35:23.580 --> 35:26.290
How am I gonna tell him what I've done?

35:26.933 --> 35:29.016
He's never gonna forgive me.

35:35.097 --> 35:38.348
Your husband's gonna forgive you, Laura.

35:38.451 --> 35:41.061
I want you to trust me on that.

35:41.726 --> 35:43.726
Your struggle,

35:43.751 --> 35:45.634
if I may,

35:45.858 --> 35:48.477
is figuring out

35:48.502 --> 35:51.503
how you're gonna forgive yourself.

35:58.876 --> 36:00.534
Vitals are stable.

36:00.559 --> 36:02.750
EKG looks good.

36:07.663 --> 36:10.030
Cleveland Clinic has an axiom.

36:10.200 --> 36:12.636
Emergency surgery on a healthy heart?

36:12.661 --> 36:14.336
Yes.

36:14.361 --> 36:16.654
Redo surgery for a repaired heart?

36:16.915 --> 36:18.498
Yes.

36:18.745 --> 36:22.477
Emergency surgery for a repaired heart?

36:22.502 --> 36:24.199
No,

36:24.740 --> 36:27.707
because overwhelmingly,

36:27.830 --> 36:30.883
those patients die on the table.

36:31.583 --> 36:34.035
I couldn't do nothing.

36:34.841 --> 36:38.297
I suspect it was ego more than altruism.

36:39.601 --> 36:41.935
Great surgeons

36:42.148 --> 36:44.194
know the balance.

36:44.919 --> 36:46.919
You're confident,

36:46.944 --> 36:49.516
not arrogant.

36:49.820 --> 36:52.635
I like that, Dr. Rhodes.

36:53.126 --> 36:56.259
Nice job today.

37:05.279 --> 37:08.413
You're good. You're good.

37:08.667 --> 37:10.313
Good boy.

37:10.338 --> 37:12.552
Good boy.

37:17.035 --> 37:19.376
Don't come from above.

37:19.400 --> 37:21.316
Come from the front so he can see you,

37:21.341 --> 37:23.310
and hold out the back
of your hand first.

37:23.335 --> 37:25.092
- Okay.
- Come on, buddy.

37:25.117 --> 37:27.475
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

37:27.500 --> 37:30.890
- Hey, there.
- [laughs]

37:31.334 --> 37:34.789
Did you ever hear that
origin story about dogs?

37:35.105 --> 37:37.993
In Eden, humans and animals got along,

37:38.018 --> 37:39.596
even spoke the same language,

37:39.621 --> 37:43.109
but when Adam and Eve sinned
and God drove them out,

37:43.134 --> 37:46.430
a great chasm opened up
between people and animals.

37:46.611 --> 37:50.062
And as the chasm grew wider,
at the very last moment,

37:50.087 --> 37:53.734
a dog leaped across it to be with us.

37:53.759 --> 37:55.804
[car trunk opening]

37:55.829 --> 37:57.990
That's a great story.

37:59.220 --> 38:01.220
Yeah.

38:05.738 --> 38:08.439
[knocks on door] Come in.

38:08.667 --> 38:10.521
Ms. Goodwin, can I talk
to you for a moment?

38:10.546 --> 38:12.746
Quickly, I'm on the
homestretch with JCAHO,

38:12.771 --> 38:14.673
and I don't want to let up now.

38:14.699 --> 38:16.507
I know my voice isn't official,

38:16.532 --> 38:17.731
but I'd like to put in a good word

38:17.756 --> 38:20.540
for Will regarding the
open ED attending position.

38:20.565 --> 38:21.514
Really?

38:21.539 --> 38:23.037
It'd be a shame to lose him.

38:23.062 --> 38:24.099
He's a great doctor.

38:24.124 --> 38:25.653
He cares about this hospital.

38:25.678 --> 38:28.836
Just a few weeks ago you asked
to be taken off his shifts.

38:28.861 --> 38:30.611
We don't always see eye to eye,

38:30.636 --> 38:33.940
but his heart is in the right place.

38:33.965 --> 38:35.431
Well, Dr. Manning,

38:35.456 --> 38:40.215
I'm glad your opinion of
Dr. Halstead has changed.

38:41.453 --> 38:43.453
Okay.

38:46.524 --> 38:49.525
[sighs]

38:49.550 --> 38:51.967
Dr. Halstead, environmental services

38:51.992 --> 38:53.316
are on their way?

38:53.341 --> 38:54.807
Nope.

38:54.890 --> 38:57.665
Turns out, every department
in the hospital's calling ES

38:57.690 --> 39:00.267
to handle things they normally
take care of themselves.

39:00.292 --> 39:02.636
Be tomorrow before a janitor shows up.

39:02.661 --> 39:05.275
- Ah, bureaucracy.
- [chuckles]

39:07.609 --> 39:09.642
Whew.

39:09.667 --> 39:11.267
Mm.

39:17.236 --> 39:18.992
[exhales]

39:19.016 --> 39:20.883
There. The room is yours again.

39:20.908 --> 39:22.614
Against protocol?

39:23.364 --> 39:24.982
I won't tell if you won't.

39:25.007 --> 39:27.909
Huh, guess that means I
get to clean this up now

39:27.934 --> 39:30.721
the way I wanted to eight hours ago.

39:30.746 --> 39:32.046
[laughs]

39:32.071 --> 39:34.071
- You know, toss me a pair.
- Oh?

39:34.096 --> 39:35.796
You know, the kind
that, uh, stick to yours

39:35.821 --> 39:38.104
when you pull 'em out.

39:39.049 --> 39:41.321
- You want in?
- Heck yeah.

39:41.346 --> 39:43.379
We've come this far.

39:43.404 --> 39:45.744
And they call you Robocop.

39:45.769 --> 39:48.603
- [clears throat]
- Robocop?

39:51.997 --> 39:54.998
[indistinct chatter]

39:57.476 --> 39:59.201
Katrina.

39:59.226 --> 40:01.554
Reese, come with me.

40:01.579 --> 40:03.154
Uh-oh.

40:03.179 --> 40:05.729
Yeah, I've seen that look.

40:05.754 --> 40:07.825
Dr. Rhodes.

40:08.018 --> 40:10.058
Everyone.

40:10.914 --> 40:14.970
Look, we all know how important
JCAHO site visits are.

40:14.995 --> 40:18.538
Yet, despite what I
said about the rules,

40:18.562 --> 40:21.897
my team ordered tests on the sly,

40:21.922 --> 40:24.255
brought a dog into the ED,

40:24.280 --> 40:27.683
and handled radioactive material.

40:30.465 --> 40:34.078
Sharon, you have every
right to be upset.

40:34.103 --> 40:36.364
Really. But we can't really be ignoring

40:36.389 --> 40:38.851
the, uh, the second law
of thermodynamics here.

40:38.876 --> 40:40.159
Now, can we?

40:40.184 --> 40:41.507
How's that?

40:41.531 --> 40:44.673
Well, systems do tend to degenerate

40:44.698 --> 40:48.563
into ever more disordered
versions of themselves, right?

40:48.644 --> 40:50.483
I mean, look around you.

40:50.508 --> 40:51.820
All we're doing here, all day long,

40:51.845 --> 40:54.995
is battle the universe's
desire to fall apart.

40:55.020 --> 40:59.098
Yeah, should've seen the
house I was in today.

40:59.123 --> 41:00.506
I'm just saying, I love rules.

41:00.531 --> 41:03.211
We all do, but in bringing
order to disorder,

41:03.236 --> 41:06.379
every now and then a
couple gonna get bent.

41:06.737 --> 41:09.608
Nice try, Daniel.

41:10.459 --> 41:13.474
But the good news is JCAHO

41:13.499 --> 41:15.499
didn't catch any of you,

41:15.523 --> 41:18.448
so we keep our top rating.

41:21.213 --> 41:23.914
I'll see you all tomorrow.

41:23.939 --> 41:26.602
Second law of thermodynamics.

41:26.627 --> 41:28.593
Please.
