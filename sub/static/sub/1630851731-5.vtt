00:03.037 --> 00:05.303
- We're never going
to make dinner.

00:05.373 --> 00:07.238
- Who needs dinner?

00:13.848 --> 00:15.847
(door closing)

00:15.883 --> 00:18.316
- I am done with men!

00:18.352 --> 00:21.586
I know I've said this before,
but this time I mean it.

00:23.624 --> 00:25.724
- You've got to start
locking that door.

00:25.726 --> 00:27.526
- Keith and I are dunzo.

00:27.595 --> 00:28.861
I should have left him
in the woods.

00:28.863 --> 00:30.728
I don't know what
I ever saw in...

00:34.802 --> 00:36.601
(sighing)

00:36.637 --> 00:39.204
Hello.
- Hello.

00:41.609 --> 00:44.276
- Oh, frankie, darling,
who is this...

00:44.345 --> 00:46.444
Handsome creature?

00:48.482 --> 00:50.682
- Nora, this is alessandro.

00:50.684 --> 00:54.018
Alessandro, this is nora.
My mother.

00:54.055 --> 00:57.289
- No!
(both laughing)

00:57.291 --> 00:59.658
- It is the greatest pleasure
to meet the woman

00:59.660 --> 01:01.893
Who brought my frankie
into this world.

01:02.930 --> 01:06.565
- Oh my, oh my.
Aren't you charming?

01:06.634 --> 01:08.766
I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

01:08.803 --> 01:11.403
- We were just on our way out.
- Looks more like you were

01:11.538 --> 01:14.039
On your way in...
If you catch my meaning.

01:14.108 --> 01:16.841
(laughing)
- no, no, no,

01:16.877 --> 01:19.244
Mrs. Drake, I have the utmost
respect for your daughter.

01:19.246 --> 01:20.645
I would never--
- no, no, no.

01:20.681 --> 01:24.116
It's ms. Amore.
That's french for love.

01:24.118 --> 01:25.717
You don't need to be
coy with me, honey.

01:25.853 --> 01:29.120
- First of all, your name
isn't amore, it's amory.

01:29.156 --> 01:31.690
And we were just trying on
costumes for the party

01:31.825 --> 01:35.060
At jelly's on Saturday.
- Sure, costumes. Likely story.

01:35.062 --> 01:37.129
- Ok. What-what--
- what?

01:37.198 --> 01:38.931
- What are you even doing here?
- What?

01:39.066 --> 01:41.799
Now I need a reason to see
my favourite daughter?

01:41.836 --> 01:43.368
Ok, fine.

01:44.672 --> 01:46.738
Listen, I need a place to stay
just for a couple of days.

01:46.874 --> 01:48.473
Just until the
presidential suite

01:48.542 --> 01:50.609
At the king eddy's available.
- And you want to stay here?

01:50.611 --> 01:53.144
- Don't you think it'd be fun?
A chance for us to catch up,

01:53.180 --> 01:54.546
Which we clearly need to do.

01:54.582 --> 01:56.481
And I want all the details
on that one!

01:56.550 --> 01:58.484

- Our reservation!

02:01.222 --> 02:02.988

02:02.990 --> 02:05.891
Do not waste a perfectly
good reservation on me.

02:05.960 --> 02:08.593
I am capable of making
myself at home.

02:10.030 --> 02:11.296

02:12.900 --> 02:15.100

even know I'm here.

02:15.235 --> 02:16.235

Pun absolutely intended.

07:26.547 --> 07:30.181
- Four unexplained deaths
between 1912 and 1921.

07:30.250 --> 07:31.550
- But nothing from
the last week or so?

07:31.685 --> 07:33.685
- Nada, which is why
I called mary.

07:33.754 --> 07:36.521
- And I found a missing person's
report filed last Tuesday

07:36.656 --> 07:39.491
For a laura gordon.
Her last known appointment

07:39.493 --> 07:41.493
Was in the building.
- The timing makes sense.

07:41.628 --> 07:43.761

our ghost!

You never said anything
about a ghost at frankie's!

- So, I spend one night
at alessandro's and suddenly

07:50.571 --> 07:53.571
We have a ghost in the office?
- I saw it with my own eyes.

07:53.640 --> 07:56.908
And before anyone asks,
no, I was not drinking.

07:57.711 --> 07:58.843
Much.

07:58.879 --> 08:02.714
- I didn't believe it at first,
either, until I saw this.

08:02.716 --> 08:05.584
- So, what? This ghost wants
to hire us to find its killer?

08:05.586 --> 08:07.252
- Well, when you put it
that way...

08:07.254 --> 08:10.322
- That's exactly what we need.
- Is this ghost going to pay us?

08:10.457 --> 08:12.557
- Well, is this is the missing
woman from mary's report,

08:12.693 --> 08:13.891
Whoever filed it might.

08:15.295 --> 08:17.061
- Ok. Mary, what do you have?

08:17.130 --> 08:19.864
- Well, the report was filed
by laura's mother judy,

08:19.900 --> 08:22.267
Who found a note
in her daughter's calendar

08:22.269 --> 08:24.436
For an appointment
at 506 beverly.

08:24.571 --> 08:27.238
- An appointment with who?
- Oh, the note didn't say.

08:27.274 --> 08:28.473
- You know,
I'm just gonna say,

08:28.608 --> 08:31.142
This doesn't
look much like the ghost.

08:31.211 --> 08:33.678
- Mary, do you think you can get
me the mother's phone number?

08:33.813 --> 08:35.847
- Sure, I can phone you
from the station with it.

08:35.982 --> 08:38.016
- Perfect.
- Bye, gals.

08:38.151 --> 08:40.918
- So we're taking the case?
- Yes.

08:40.954 --> 08:42.821
Of the missing woman,
not of the ghost in the office.

08:42.956 --> 08:44.889
- Who's to say it's not
one and the same?

08:44.892 --> 08:47.892
- Science. You know, I didn't
peg you to be a believer.

08:47.961 --> 08:49.895
- Well, there's a lot
science cannot explain to us

08:50.030 --> 08:52.697
About what happens after we die.
- Ok, well, ghost or no ghost,

08:52.699 --> 08:54.299
We need to talk
to these neighbours.

08:54.368 --> 08:56.434
I'll see if I can find out
who laura met up with.

08:56.470 --> 08:58.836
(intriguing music)

08:58.906 --> 09:00.305
- I just--

09:00.440 --> 09:03.374
I know something terrible
has happened to my laura.

09:03.410 --> 09:05.043
- Well, is there anything

09:05.178 --> 09:06.578
You can tell me that would
help me find her?

09:06.713 --> 09:08.847
Places she goes,
or friends she could be with?

09:08.982 --> 09:11.883
- Honestly, miss drake,
I couldn't say.

09:11.952 --> 09:15.386
She's grown quite...
Secretive.

09:15.422 --> 09:18.623
- Secretive how?
- We'd always been very close.

09:18.625 --> 09:21.059
My mother was very distant

09:21.128 --> 09:23.528
With me growing up,
you see,

09:23.530 --> 09:26.330
And I didn't want to be
that way with my daughter.

09:26.366 --> 09:28.333
So, laura and I,

09:28.402 --> 09:30.167
We shared everything.

09:31.271 --> 09:32.737
- I'm sensing a "but"?

09:32.773 --> 09:35.673
- A few weeks ago,
everything changed.

09:37.010 --> 09:40.678
She started staying out
all hours, refusing to say why.

09:40.714 --> 09:43.214
And the more I pushed,
the more she...

09:43.216 --> 09:44.649
Pulled away.

09:46.019 --> 09:48.953
I mean, for all I know,
she's dead!

09:48.956 --> 09:50.688
(crying)

09:53.260 --> 09:55.427
- We're going to find her.

09:55.562 --> 09:57.529
- (woman): Never seen her
in my life.

09:57.531 --> 09:59.697
- Are you sure?

09:59.766 --> 10:01.766
- Maybe you could take
a closer look, miss falk.

10:01.835 --> 10:03.968
- Call me dolly.
Everyone does.

10:03.971 --> 10:05.970
- Ok, then, dolly.

10:05.973 --> 10:07.706
- You talk to the old witch
down the hall

10:07.841 --> 10:10.508
About this missing gal of yours?
- You mean miss underwood?

10:10.577 --> 10:14.579
- Always covered in blood,
smiling like a maniac.

10:14.648 --> 10:16.314
I bet she knows something.

10:17.784 --> 10:20.051
- Well, we will definitely talk
to her, but in the meantime,

10:20.053 --> 10:21.752
Does she look
familiar at all?

10:23.256 --> 10:26.657
- Like I said,
never seen her in my life.

10:26.693 --> 10:28.926
- So you didn't meet with her
on Tuesday, then?

10:28.996 --> 10:30.595
- Proper young ladies like that

10:30.664 --> 10:34.532
Aren't interested in the sorts
of imports I traffic in.

10:35.736 --> 10:37.402
- What sorts of things
are those?

10:38.505 --> 10:40.939
- Nightmare makers.

10:40.941 --> 10:45.477
(foreboding music)

10:50.617 --> 10:53.551
- Uh... I do not
like it here, trudy.

10:55.822 --> 10:58.222
- Oh, mr. Whinder! Hello.
- I wish I could talk, honey,

10:58.258 --> 11:01.559
But a reservation at
chez rudolpho waits for no man.

11:01.561 --> 11:03.895
- If I could just have one mo--

11:03.897 --> 11:05.963
- Please watch
where you're going.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.965
- Excuse you.

11:11.071 --> 11:13.804
(lively jazz music)

11:18.678 --> 11:21.112
- I, um... I hope
we're not interrupting,

11:21.247 --> 11:24.516
Miss underwood?
- Just give me one...

11:24.651 --> 11:26.784
Second...

11:29.122 --> 11:33.257
There! Porcupines
are a thorny task!

11:33.293 --> 11:35.560
(laughing)

11:35.629 --> 11:37.061
Miss clarke,

11:37.130 --> 11:39.664
It is so good to see you!
And you brought a friend!

11:39.799 --> 11:42.767
- Yes, my colleague flo.
- Oh, two detectives?

11:42.903 --> 11:45.537
Ooh, this must be serious.
What can I do for you?

11:45.672 --> 11:48.072
- We're looking for a woman
who went missing.

11:49.209 --> 11:52.009
- You know, she looks
a little like the gal

11:52.011 --> 11:54.345
That used to work
for the shoemaker upstairs.

11:54.347 --> 11:56.848
A terrible tragedy, that.
- How do you mean?

11:56.983 --> 11:59.818
- Found dead in the elevator
shaft back in 1917.

11:59.820 --> 12:01.152
- Oh, no! That's not
who we're looking for.

12:01.188 --> 12:03.955
- The police never quite figured
that one out, but for my money,

12:03.957 --> 12:06.191
The pudgy plumber
that used to work next door

12:06.193 --> 12:08.693
Pushed her. They were
having a secret affair,

12:08.762 --> 12:10.961
But then there was--
- that's fascinating, really.

12:10.997 --> 12:13.297
It is, but the woman
we're looking for

12:13.333 --> 12:15.967
Disappeared on Tuesday.
- Oh.

12:15.969 --> 12:17.569
Oh, I'm sorry,
I can't help you.

12:17.571 --> 12:20.772
Tuesday is my roadkill day!
- Come again?

12:20.774 --> 12:23.308
- I drive the highway,
searching for fresh specimens.

12:23.310 --> 12:25.777
You know, sometimes, I get lucky
and they're still warm.

12:25.846 --> 12:27.712
- I would have thought
the impact would make

12:27.714 --> 12:30.181
The roadkill unusable.
-<i> Au contraire!</i>

12:30.316 --> 12:32.183
Most succumb
to blunt force trauma.

12:32.185 --> 12:35.286
They're pristine -
not a scratch on them.

12:35.288 --> 12:38.522
You know, I think I have
a fresh raccoon in the ice box.

12:38.558 --> 12:40.925
I can show it to you!
- Oh, you know what?

12:40.994 --> 12:43.394
I think I left the kettle on
at home. We'll come back

12:43.463 --> 12:45.497
And see it another day.
- Yes!

12:45.632 --> 12:47.465
- Thank you so much,
miss underwood.

12:47.534 --> 12:49.400
- Oh! My pleasure!
Oh, and don't forget,

12:49.402 --> 12:52.469
I offer a 20% discount
for neighbours!

12:57.076 --> 12:59.210
(cat meowing)
- oh!

12:59.279 --> 13:01.245
Get back here, felix.

13:01.748 --> 13:03.347
Aw...

13:03.383 --> 13:04.949
- Who's that?

13:05.018 --> 13:06.317
- Um...

13:08.822 --> 13:10.021
I-I'm sorry.

13:10.090 --> 13:12.157
I know we're not supposed
to have pets in here,

13:12.292 --> 13:14.359
But my apartment
is being fumigated

13:14.361 --> 13:17.629
And I couldn't risk
the little guy getting sick.

13:17.631 --> 13:19.697
Please don't tell
my landlord?

13:19.699 --> 13:21.499
- Your secret's safe with me...

13:21.634 --> 13:23.868
If you can help me
with something.

13:23.904 --> 13:25.636
- Sure. Anything.

13:25.672 --> 13:29.440
- Do you know this woman?
- Of course I do.

13:29.576 --> 13:31.942
Isn't she lovely?

13:32.946 --> 13:34.579
- How long have
you two been together?

13:34.581 --> 13:36.513
- Ah, only a few weeks, but...

13:36.550 --> 13:39.851
Well... I think
she might be the one.

13:39.986 --> 13:41.186
- Wow.

13:41.321 --> 13:43.855
- I was fresh off a bad split
when I met laura,

13:43.857 --> 13:46.057
And she made me believe
in love again.

13:46.059 --> 13:48.493
- What were the two of you
doing last Tuesday?

13:48.628 --> 13:50.194
- Ah... Tuesday, nothing.

13:50.230 --> 13:52.196
I haven't seen her
since last weekend.

13:52.199 --> 13:54.265
Why? What's...
What's going on?

13:54.301 --> 13:57.401
- I'm sorry to have to be
the one to tell you this,

13:57.437 --> 13:59.537
But her mother
reported her missing.

13:59.539 --> 14:01.339
- What?

14:01.408 --> 14:03.407
- You're sure you didn't
see her last Tuesday?

14:03.476 --> 14:06.344
- Of course I'm sure.
Wait, you don't think

14:06.346 --> 14:08.479
I had anything to do with
laura's disappearance, do you?

14:08.615 --> 14:11.282
- No. Of course not.

14:11.284 --> 14:13.317
Thank you.

14:25.965 --> 14:27.832
Looks like I figured out who...

14:27.967 --> 14:30.167
- Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh!
- What are you guys doing?

14:30.203 --> 14:31.969
- We didn't get very far at
the neighbours', so we decided

14:32.005 --> 14:35.440
To go straight to the source.
- I said it was a very bad idea,

14:35.442 --> 14:37.775
But who listens to me?
Nobody.

14:37.777 --> 14:39.843
Sorry.

14:39.880 --> 14:42.180
- Laura gordon,
we received your message.

14:42.315 --> 14:44.315
We want to help you.

14:44.317 --> 14:47.384
Tell us who killed you.
(knocking on door)

14:47.420 --> 14:49.320
(nora screaming)

14:49.455 --> 14:51.789
- I'm so sorry.

14:51.791 --> 14:53.858
I'm so... What--
don't answer the door!

14:53.860 --> 14:55.259
- It's fine!

14:59.199 --> 15:01.365
- I hear you've been
looking for me?

15:08.475 --> 15:10.408
I didn't mean
to cause any trouble.

15:10.477 --> 15:12.410
- (trudy): Well, we're just
glad you're ok.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.679
- No thanks to that
boorish watchmaker.

15:14.814 --> 15:17.047
- Michael whinder?
- That's why I was here

15:17.083 --> 15:19.751
On Tuesday, interviewing
to be his shop girl.

15:19.886 --> 15:22.754
- Did he get a little handsy?
- In a word.

15:22.889 --> 15:25.957
I just couldn't face to go home.
- Why not?

15:26.026 --> 15:28.892
- Ah, so my mother didn't
mention the fight we had, then?

15:28.929 --> 15:30.928
- Not exactly.

15:32.132 --> 15:34.365
What was it about?
- Same as always.

15:34.500 --> 15:36.534
She was upset that
I want a private life.

15:36.669 --> 15:38.636
Except this time,
she said if I don't explain

15:38.705 --> 15:40.838
My comings and goings,

15:40.840 --> 15:42.573
I can find another
place to live.

15:42.575 --> 15:45.042
- And you called her bluff.
Good girl.

15:45.111 --> 15:47.278
- I just needed some time
to think it through.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.313
My mother is quite overbearing.

15:49.316 --> 15:52.016
- Ugh.
- I hear some can be like that.

15:52.152 --> 15:54.919
- Oh, that must
be dreadful.

15:55.054 --> 15:57.688
- I'm afraid we've frightened
your boyfriend for no reason.

15:57.724 --> 16:00.792
- Poor robert. I'll pop up
to see him right now.

16:00.927 --> 16:02.660
(nora chuckling)

16:02.729 --> 16:05.396
- That is a beautiful coat.
- Thank you.

16:05.531 --> 16:08.232
A gift from robert.
- Lucky girl!

16:08.368 --> 16:10.667
- Don't I know it!
(chuckling)

16:10.704 --> 16:13.738
- Well, I think we've earned
a drink at jelly's!

16:13.807 --> 16:15.807
- Mm-hmm!
- A drink! A drink!

16:15.942 --> 16:18.342
(phone ringing)
- drake private detectives.

16:18.411 --> 16:22.179
- Eerie voice: [he's a killer.]
- hello? Who is this?

16:23.516 --> 16:25.750
The line went dead.
- A prank?

16:25.819 --> 16:28.419
- Or it's the ghost.
- It's not a ghost.

16:28.554 --> 16:30.388
- Come on, frankie, between
the notes and these calls?

16:30.390 --> 16:33.791
- And the ghost that I saw
with my own two eyes!

16:33.860 --> 16:36.160
- You have to admit, something
funny is going on here.

16:36.196 --> 16:38.695
- It doesn't mean
that we're being haunted.
- It doesn't mean we aren't.

16:38.732 --> 16:40.431
- So, how do we find out
which it is?

16:40.566 --> 16:43.367
- Ok, this is going to be easy.
You just have to stay

16:43.370 --> 16:46.970
And wait it out.
- That is not a bad idea.

16:47.007 --> 16:49.373
- You're welcome.
- Ok, so...

16:49.376 --> 16:52.176
We stay up all night
and wait for the ghost

16:52.311 --> 16:54.311
To make an appearance,
and catch whatever--

16:54.347 --> 16:56.647
- Whoever.
- ...In the act.

16:56.783 --> 16:58.182
- A good,
old-fashioned sleepover.

16:59.285 --> 17:01.052
- Where are you going?

17:01.187 --> 17:04.522
- Wha-- oh! To a hotel.
- This was your idea.

17:04.591 --> 17:06.791
- Well, I'm so glad you see
the brilliance in it. It's just,

17:06.926 --> 17:09.127
I've already spent one sleepless
night because of this ghost

17:09.129 --> 17:10.862
And I don't intend
to have another.
- That's mine.

17:10.997 --> 17:12.496
- Please?

17:15.435 --> 17:17.935
- It's basically a stakeout.
- But for a ghost.

17:18.071 --> 17:20.872
- Well, whatever you do,
don't provoke it.

17:20.874 --> 17:22.807
Spirits can be vengeful.

17:25.011 --> 17:26.944
(flo chuckling)

17:28.481 --> 17:30.681
- Maybe we should do this
stakeout at your place, flo.

17:30.750 --> 17:33.151
- How is it gonna help us find
out who's haunting the office?

17:33.153 --> 17:36.687
- It won't, but maybe if
we give the ghost some space,

17:36.756 --> 17:39.290
It will just...
Go away on its own?

17:39.292 --> 17:41.291
- I don't think
that's how it works.

17:41.327 --> 17:44.829
Listen, I know you're scared,
but what if it was your father?

17:44.964 --> 17:48.166
Or my herb? Wouldn't you want
to help them find some peace?

17:48.168 --> 17:50.901
- Four orders of chop suey
and six spring rolls to go.

17:50.970 --> 17:53.036
- Do you really want
to miss all this?

17:53.073 --> 17:55.372
- Well, a girl's gotta eat.
- (chuckling): Exactly.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.908
Thanks, ai lin.
- My pleasure. And good luck.

17:57.944 --> 18:00.444
(jazz music)

18:00.447 --> 18:02.513
(ai lin sighing)

18:02.582 --> 18:04.915
- So, we got a call claiming
an unknown man to be the killer.

18:04.951 --> 18:06.584
We have a note
with no fingerprints

18:06.653 --> 18:08.585
Asking for help about
the killer. And then,

18:08.621 --> 18:11.389
There is whatever nora saw.
- Claims to have seen.

18:11.391 --> 18:14.992
- Here, I can help you.
- Oh! Thank you.

18:15.128 --> 18:17.662
- So, did nora say what
the so-called ghost looked like?

18:17.664 --> 18:19.263
- He had, like,
a bloody face?

18:19.398 --> 18:20.431
- Argh!

18:21.768 --> 18:23.568
Sorry.
- It's ok.

18:23.703 --> 18:25.603
- Here.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.605
Sorry.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.607
Just... Give me one minute.

18:29.742 --> 18:31.609
- Uh... Where was I?

18:31.678 --> 18:33.077
- A bloody face.
- Right.

18:33.212 --> 18:35.813
And she said something
about a high-pitched voice?

18:35.815 --> 18:38.149
(high-pitched screaming)

18:40.320 --> 18:42.553
- Get it off!
Get it off! Get it off!

18:42.688 --> 18:45.389
- Mary, what happened?
- I was trying to rinse my shirt

18:45.425 --> 18:48.058
And there's blood in the tap!
- It's ok, I'll take it to work.

18:48.094 --> 18:50.461
I can get blood out of anything.
- (mary): Oh-oh-oh!

18:50.596 --> 18:53.030
I told you!
- Oh, my god!

18:53.066 --> 18:54.465
- I told you!

18:54.600 --> 18:56.633
- There's only one place
that this could be coming from.

18:59.005 --> 19:02.039
- Be careful.
- Here. Here, I got it.

19:04.477 --> 19:06.243
(sighing)

19:06.312 --> 19:08.112
- Thought so.

19:15.188 --> 19:17.588
- Caught me.

19:17.657 --> 19:20.057
- Who are you?
What are you doing up here?

19:20.059 --> 19:22.393
- Oh, I could ask you
the same thing.

19:23.429 --> 19:25.462
- Frankie drake.
I'm a private detective.

19:25.498 --> 19:28.732
- Pleased to meet you,
private detective frankie drake.

19:31.237 --> 19:33.604
- And you are?
- Sebastian.

19:33.673 --> 19:37.074
I just opened up a carpentry
studio downstairs.

19:37.076 --> 19:38.609
- Well, that answers
my first question.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.077
Now, what are you
doing up here?

19:42.382 --> 19:45.916
- I'm afraid that's none
of your business, detective.

19:50.089 --> 19:51.956
I think I'll go home
for the night.

19:57.030 --> 19:59.096
(door closing)

19:59.098 --> 20:02.633
♪♪

20:02.635 --> 20:05.569
(humming)

20:05.605 --> 20:07.705
- Well, I know
who's messing with us.

20:07.774 --> 20:10.107
Now I just need
to figure out why.

20:10.176 --> 20:12.510
- Was it the ghost?
- No, it was sebastian,

20:12.645 --> 20:15.379
All flesh and blood,
and rude!

20:15.415 --> 20:17.448
- Wait, who's sebastian?
- He's a carpenter

20:17.450 --> 20:19.116
Who apparently just opened up
a studio downstairs.

20:19.252 --> 20:20.885
- So, he was the one tampering
with the water tank?

20:21.020 --> 20:23.454
- No, but he was-he was skulking
around and when I asked him

20:23.589 --> 20:26.390
What he was doing at this time
of night, he wouldn't answer me.

20:26.392 --> 20:27.925
Do you know where
the lock-picking kit is?

20:28.060 --> 20:30.261
- Yeah. Flo and I thought
we'd see who else the watchmaker

20:30.330 --> 20:31.796
Interviewed besides
laura gordon.

20:31.931 --> 20:34.131
- If he got handsy with her,
maybe he did with someone else.

20:34.133 --> 20:36.233
They fought,
one thing led to another.

20:36.236 --> 20:38.035
- It's worth it to take a look.
- Mm-hmm.

20:38.104 --> 20:40.871
- Hold on! If you're leaving,
then I'm going to be here alone.

20:43.676 --> 20:45.543
- For protection.

20:49.949 --> 20:52.015
(door opening)

21:07.033 --> 21:07.898
(suspenseful music)

21:07.967 --> 21:11.168
Oh, sweet creamy custard!
- Flo, shh!

21:11.237 --> 21:13.304
It's just a picture.
- Who leaves a portrait

21:13.306 --> 21:15.572
Of themselves looking like that
hanging around?

21:15.608 --> 21:17.775
- A man who thinks his teeth
are his best feature?

21:17.910 --> 21:19.510
- You know, he's not wrong.

21:19.579 --> 21:21.311
- Can we just find the resumes
and get out of here?

21:31.991 --> 21:34.391
Here! I found the resumes.

21:42.502 --> 21:43.300
- Can I help you?

21:43.435 --> 21:45.636
- You got a cup of sugar?

21:45.705 --> 21:48.739
- Sorry, no.
- Ok, look! Confession time.

21:48.874 --> 21:50.875
I didn't actually
come here for sugar.

21:50.877 --> 21:53.010
- Yeah? Never
would have guessed.

21:53.145 --> 21:54.678
- I wanted to apologize.

21:54.747 --> 21:57.214
I think we got off
on the wrong foot.

21:58.617 --> 22:00.984
I didn't realize
you lived here as well.

22:02.421 --> 22:05.456
Do you live alone?
- Yeah. Why?

22:05.525 --> 22:08.558
- It's just my living space is
so cramped. I'm always curious

22:08.594 --> 22:10.494
How other people make it work.
Maybe I could come in

22:10.629 --> 22:12.663
And take a look?
- Yeah, maybe some other time.

22:14.701 --> 22:18.569
- Alessandro contento,
you old flirt!

22:18.638 --> 22:20.705
I'm not that kind of gal.

22:23.710 --> 22:24.775
Oh! Oh!

22:26.045 --> 22:29.113
(suspenseful music)

22:36.789 --> 22:37.855
(screaming)

22:37.924 --> 22:40.724
- Oh, frankie!
- Expecting someone else?

22:40.793 --> 22:43.427
- Well, all the lights went out
and I thought...

22:43.563 --> 22:45.463
And then your footsteps
on the stairs.

22:45.465 --> 22:47.597
You just gave me a fright.
- I'm sorry.

22:47.633 --> 22:50.000
I need your help
down in the basement.

22:50.002 --> 22:51.701
- Oh. Ok.

22:54.574 --> 22:58.108
(eerie music)

23:01.814 --> 23:04.381
- (whispering): Anything?
- Not that I could see.

23:06.219 --> 23:08.152
You stay here
and keep lookout.

23:08.154 --> 23:10.020
- You don't have
to ask me twice.

23:28.107 --> 23:30.240
- (sighing): Nothing seems
out of place in there.

23:30.309 --> 23:32.309
I mean, it's creepy--
(screaming)

23:32.311 --> 23:34.511
(groaning)

23:40.719 --> 23:42.653
- I don't know
about this, frankie.

23:42.655 --> 23:44.654
- There's nothing
to be scared of, mary.

23:44.690 --> 23:47.591
I just need to find
the... Bingo!

23:49.629 --> 23:51.728
I knew this had been
tampered with.

23:51.764 --> 23:55.065
I bet I know who did it. Here.
- Do you really think

23:55.134 --> 23:56.801
The carpenter had something
to do with this?

23:56.936 --> 23:59.203
- I do. I just need
to figure out why.

23:59.205 --> 24:01.538
(creaking)

24:07.180 --> 24:08.479
Mary, I need the light.

24:11.184 --> 24:12.216
(screaming)

24:12.351 --> 24:13.817
- Oh my god! Frankie!

24:21.027 --> 24:22.726
- It had to have been sebastian

24:22.728 --> 24:23.960
Who knocked the shelf
over on me.

24:23.996 --> 24:26.563
No one else would have been
in the building at that time.

24:26.599 --> 24:28.565
- Just because he wasn't
flirting with you

24:28.701 --> 24:30.634
Doesn't mean he's trying
to kill you, frankie.

24:30.670 --> 24:32.169
- It's not
because he-- what?

24:32.304 --> 24:35.706
I have a gut feeling.
<i> What?</i>

24:35.841 --> 24:37.441
- How is a gut feeling
any different

24:37.576 --> 24:39.242
Than believing in ghosts?
- It just is.

24:39.278 --> 24:40.544
- Good morning, ai lin!

24:40.680 --> 24:42.846
- Good morning, gals! What are
you all doing here so early?

24:42.915 --> 24:44.248
- We never went to sleep.

24:44.250 --> 24:46.182
- Oh, right.
The ghost in the office.

24:46.219 --> 24:48.251
- Well, we're still
split on that.

24:48.287 --> 24:50.654
Who's this?
- Oh!

24:50.656 --> 24:53.256
Haven't you met christopher?
He's been delivering the paper

24:53.292 --> 24:55.726
In the neighbourhood
for almost a year now.

24:55.728 --> 24:57.594
What can we do for you?
- My mom's asking

24:57.663 --> 25:00.397
If we can settle up.
We're due at zeppi's.

25:00.433 --> 25:02.533
- I'll be right there. And, hey,
go make sure she leaves me

25:02.602 --> 25:05.135
A couple jars of those
pickled beets, will you?

25:05.137 --> 25:07.104
(chuckling)
mrs. Miller's pickled beets

25:07.106 --> 25:09.473
Are the secret to that stew
you like so much, mary.

25:09.542 --> 25:11.876
- Oh. Really?
Is it on the menu today?

25:12.011 --> 25:14.411
- It's 8 in the morning.
- Well, I need all the protein

25:14.413 --> 25:16.680
I can get if I'm gonna get
through the whole day of work

25:16.682 --> 25:18.982
On no sleep.
- Speaking of sleep...

25:19.051 --> 25:21.285
Oh! I had the most
glorious night of it.

25:21.420 --> 25:24.021
Ah, the carls-rite
is heavenly.

25:24.156 --> 25:26.891
So, how was your little
sleepover, hm? Fruitful?

25:27.026 --> 25:29.159
- We have a strong lead.
- Two, actually,

25:29.228 --> 25:31.695
Which reminds me:
I'm gonna track down those women

25:31.731 --> 25:33.697
That mr. Whinder interviewed.

25:33.733 --> 25:36.767
And I assume you have something
planned for sebastian?

25:36.769 --> 25:40.137
- Sebastian? Another man
in your life, frankie?

25:40.272 --> 25:42.973
- No! He's a suspect.
- Oh. Mm-hmm.

25:43.009 --> 25:45.042
- I'll fill you in later.

25:45.177 --> 25:46.910
- Hmm-hmm?
- Just go.

25:46.913 --> 25:48.612
- Oh, it's fine.
Suit yourself.

25:50.016 --> 25:51.381
- You know, mary,

25:51.450 --> 25:53.383
I would love to get into
sebastian's apartment.

25:53.419 --> 25:55.251
Do you think you can come up
with an excuse to bring him down

25:55.288 --> 25:57.354
To the station?
- Yes, of course.

25:57.489 --> 26:00.223
- And if you don't find
anything on sebastian?

26:00.293 --> 26:01.825
- Then he's off the hook.

26:01.827 --> 26:03.760
- Did I hear someone
say sebastian?

26:03.829 --> 26:05.262
I heard he moved
into your building.

26:05.397 --> 26:06.930
- Do you know him?
- Not nearly as well

26:06.933 --> 26:08.965
As I'd like. Why are
all the good ones married?

26:11.537 --> 26:13.070
- He told me that
he lived alone

26:13.072 --> 26:14.605
And I didn't see a ring
on his finger.

26:14.607 --> 26:16.373
- Why would someone
lie about that?

26:16.508 --> 26:17.875
- I can think of
a reason or two.

26:17.877 --> 26:19.476
- He's definitely
hiding something.

26:19.545 --> 26:21.679
I'm gonna find out what.

26:21.681 --> 26:25.015
(intriguing music)

26:32.692 --> 26:34.758
- Ke8547, please.

26:36.562 --> 26:39.096
Hi, could I speak
to andrea holmes?

26:39.231 --> 26:40.697
Oh.

26:40.833 --> 26:42.966
Well, can you tell me
when you expect her to be back?

26:45.371 --> 26:48.104
Tell me, when was the last time
you saw miss holmes?

26:49.908 --> 26:51.709
Tuesday morning.

26:51.711 --> 26:54.378
Ah. Can you tell me something?

26:54.513 --> 26:57.247
Does miss holmes often go away
for days at a time?

26:57.283 --> 26:59.349
Maybe for work, or...?

27:00.386 --> 27:02.186
Ah. I see.

27:02.321 --> 27:04.354
Well, thank you very much.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.659
(dramatic music)

27:14.333 --> 27:17.401
- Gareth, you're in luck.
I just finished making your bed.

27:17.403 --> 27:20.471
- Oh, very funny.

27:20.606 --> 27:23.273
- What on harry's half acre
are you doing now?

27:23.342 --> 27:26.009
- Oh, don't get excited.
I'm just returning this

27:26.012 --> 27:27.677
To the old guy in fridge five.

27:27.713 --> 27:31.548
- I'm sorry, are you saying
you stole a suit from a corpse?

27:31.617 --> 27:33.083
- It was more of a loan.

27:33.152 --> 27:36.353
I had a date last night
with a real looker.

27:36.355 --> 27:38.354
- Well, she obviously
wasn't a real smeller

27:38.391 --> 27:40.257
'cause she didn't notice
the aura of decomposition

27:40.259 --> 27:41.892
All over you.

27:45.831 --> 27:48.632
Since when does blood
dry pink?

27:48.701 --> 27:51.635
(suspenseful music)

27:53.406 --> 27:55.004
- Hello?

27:59.545 --> 28:01.644
(picking lock)

28:05.284 --> 28:06.984
Thank you, mary.

28:17.396 --> 28:18.729
- You just can't seem
to keep your nose

28:18.798 --> 28:20.798
Out of my business,
can you?

28:23.669 --> 28:26.603
- Yeah, I interviewed
andrea holmes.

28:26.605 --> 28:28.672
Bad fit. A bit of a prude.

28:28.807 --> 28:30.407
- And what did you do
after you interviewed

28:30.476 --> 28:33.077
The prudish miss holmes?
Because she's missing.

28:33.212 --> 28:34.177
- Missing?

28:35.281 --> 28:36.312
And you think I--?

28:37.449 --> 28:40.550
That was what? Tuesday?

28:40.586 --> 28:42.352
Ah, right.

28:43.622 --> 28:45.289
I was with my mother.

28:45.291 --> 28:47.991
- I'm gonna need her number.
- I can do you one better.

28:51.997 --> 28:55.699
- [operator.]
- yes. Em5620.

28:55.834 --> 28:58.802
- [I'll connect you.]
- woman: [hello!]

28:58.938 --> 29:00.503
- Hello, mumsy!
- [michael, darling!]

29:00.539 --> 29:02.105
- I'm sorry to bother you.
- [not at all.]

29:02.108 --> 29:04.975
- I need you to tell a young
lady about our rummy tournament.

29:04.977 --> 29:06.877
- [rummy? Whatever for?
All right, if you say so.]

29:10.916 --> 29:13.250
- Hello, mrs. Whinder, I'm--
- [it was a fine tournament.]

29:13.252 --> 29:14.852
[Tuesday.
We had six people in.]

29:14.987 --> 29:16.753
- And he was with you
all evening?

29:16.789 --> 29:17.921
- [of course, dear!]

29:17.990 --> 29:20.190
[he stayed to help and tidy up.]
- great, thank you.

29:20.325 --> 29:21.859
- [such a good boy. Will you be
joining us next week--]

29:21.861 --> 29:24.728
- Oh, no, I am no good at cards.
- [well, such a shame.]

29:24.797 --> 29:26.863
[perhaps I could teach you.]
- well, then. Thank you.

29:26.899 --> 29:28.765
- [my pleasure, I'm sure.
Ta-ta!]

29:28.768 --> 29:29.867
- Now, if there is
nothing else...

29:30.002 --> 29:33.537
- There is one more thing.
Can you tell me if miss holmes

29:33.672 --> 29:36.340
Said or did anything
that seemed... Unusual?

29:36.342 --> 29:40.677
- Well, she was nervous,
but that's hardly strange.

29:40.746 --> 29:43.346
(chuckling)
I cut an imposing figure.

29:46.752 --> 29:48.685
- Oh, ok.

29:48.821 --> 29:51.955
Is that everything?
Any little thing could help.

29:53.692 --> 29:55.892
- You know, she did
say something

29:56.028 --> 29:58.295
About seeing someone
she hadn't expected to.

29:58.297 --> 29:59.963
And actually...

30:01.667 --> 30:04.134
She ran out so fast
she left that behind.

30:04.203 --> 30:05.501
- Hm.

30:05.538 --> 30:08.038
- Give it to her for me
if you find her.

30:08.107 --> 30:10.073
Will you, sweetheart?

30:14.913 --> 30:16.613
- What are you doing
in my apartment?

30:16.615 --> 30:18.448
- You've been messing with me
and I'm gonna find out why.

30:18.484 --> 30:20.783
- I got no idea what
you're on about, lady.

30:20.820 --> 30:22.319
- I think you do.

30:22.321 --> 30:25.121
- Look, I don't want to have
to call the cops, so please,

30:25.157 --> 30:26.857
Just get out of here.
- Go ahead,

30:26.859 --> 30:29.059
Call the cops. Then you can
explain what you've been doing.

30:29.128 --> 30:30.260
- What the hell
are you talking about?

30:30.296 --> 30:32.663
- The taps running red,
the blackout,

30:32.798 --> 30:34.464
The threatening letter...
I know it was all you.

30:34.466 --> 30:36.667
- Why would I be
playing kids' pranks

30:36.669 --> 30:39.269
On a woman I didn't know
existed until yesterday?

30:39.271 --> 30:41.605
- That's a very good
question, isn't it?

30:41.674 --> 30:44.007
You know what I think?
I think you don't like

30:44.009 --> 30:45.609
Having a private detective
in your building.

30:45.744 --> 30:47.543
I think you want me
out of here

30:47.580 --> 30:48.779
Because you have
something to hide.

30:48.781 --> 30:51.147
- All right, that's it.
I've listened to enough of this.

30:51.217 --> 30:52.649
It's time for you to leave--

30:55.154 --> 30:56.753
(laughing)

30:56.822 --> 30:58.688
This took me hours
to build, you know.

30:58.724 --> 31:01.224
- I guess you should be
more careful, shouldn't you?

31:02.828 --> 31:04.761
- Maybe<i> you</i> should be
more careful.

31:06.899 --> 31:09.899
Now why are you shoving people
like some kind of boxer?

31:11.704 --> 31:14.037
- Believe me, if I was boxing,
you would know.

31:14.039 --> 31:17.040
- Uh... Am I
interrupting something?

31:17.175 --> 31:19.076
- Who are you?
- It's not what it looks like.

31:19.211 --> 31:20.711
- Whatever you say, frankie.

31:20.846 --> 31:23.046
- Do you know this woman?

31:23.181 --> 31:25.048
Because she has broken
into my home twice

31:25.183 --> 31:26.783
In the past 24 hours
without cause--

31:26.852 --> 31:28.752
- Oh, I'd say there's cause.
- Anything that makes

31:28.887 --> 31:30.687
The slightest bit of sense?
- You haven't even told me

31:30.756 --> 31:32.589
What you were doing up on the
roof in the middle of the night!

31:32.724 --> 31:33.823
- Because it's none
of your business.

31:33.859 --> 31:36.393
- Agree to disagree.
- Oh, can you guys be quiet?

31:36.528 --> 31:38.862
Frankie, I got
to show you something.

31:38.997 --> 31:41.198
(sighing)

31:44.202 --> 31:46.002
- You owe me for that table.

31:46.805 --> 31:47.738
- Bill me.

31:48.974 --> 31:50.340
(sighing)

31:53.612 --> 31:54.678
It's still wet.

31:54.813 --> 31:56.546
- Which means it couldn't
have been sebastian.

31:56.615 --> 31:58.682
- Ghosts don't have footprints.

32:02.754 --> 32:03.820
(clanking)

32:06.358 --> 32:07.757
- There!

32:07.793 --> 32:10.126
(dramatic music)

32:12.298 --> 32:15.064
Where is it?
- We were just on its heels.

32:21.740 --> 32:24.474
♪♪

32:26.912 --> 32:29.179
- I bet you think you're
pretty smart, don't you?

32:29.248 --> 32:32.449
Take off the mask, you've got
some explaining to do.

32:42.094 --> 32:44.261
- Well, whoever's messing
with us, it isn't sebastian.

32:44.396 --> 32:47.731
- Or a ghost.
- My gut was wrong.

32:47.800 --> 32:49.332
- So, what I'm hearing is
both your strong leads

32:49.401 --> 32:51.334
Turned out to be bupkis,
is that right?

32:51.370 --> 32:53.936
- I wouldn't say it was bupkis.
- And it doesn't mean

32:53.973 --> 32:56.139
Something bad didn't happen
in the building.

32:58.410 --> 33:00.476
The landlady said andrea's
been missing since Tuesday.

33:00.512 --> 33:02.813
- Let me guess, right after her
interview with michael whinder?

33:02.948 --> 33:05.749
- Oh, so it was the handsy
watchmaker all along?

33:05.751 --> 33:08.151
- No, I don't think he has
anything to do with it.
- Why is that?

33:08.286 --> 33:09.786
- Well, he said when he met
with her, she was really nervous

33:09.822 --> 33:12.556
And she was in such a rush
to leave, she left this behind.

33:12.558 --> 33:14.824
Apparently she had an
unexpected run-in with someone.

33:16.094 --> 33:18.528
- Speaking of unexpected
run-ins...

33:20.432 --> 33:22.065
I found our ghost.

33:22.200 --> 33:25.568
- That pipsqueak gave me
the fright of my life?

33:25.604 --> 33:27.904
- He's responsible for
everything that's been going on.

33:27.940 --> 33:29.705
He even used his mother's
pickled beets

33:29.742 --> 33:32.509
To make the water run red.
Ingenious, really.

33:34.580 --> 33:37.847
And also very, very wrong.
- I'm sorry if I scared anyone.

33:37.916 --> 33:40.117
And, I swear,
the shelf that broke?

33:40.119 --> 33:42.719
It was an accident.
I was only trying

33:42.721 --> 33:44.921
To help you find out
what happened to the lady.

33:44.923 --> 33:46.322
- Can you tell us
what you saw?

33:46.358 --> 33:49.225
- She was in a stairwell
with someone. A man, I think.

33:49.294 --> 33:51.861
- The unexpected run-in?
- What did he look like?

33:51.930 --> 33:55.198
- He had dark hair
and a dark coat.

33:55.333 --> 33:57.634
- And what happened?
- The man pushed the lady

33:57.769 --> 34:01.271
And she disappeared.
Then, the man went downstairs,

34:01.273 --> 34:03.473
And I didn't see
the lady again.

34:03.475 --> 34:06.876
- Did he leave the building?
- Not for a long time.

34:06.945 --> 34:08.678
- Well, why did you get
all dressed up as a ghost?

34:08.747 --> 34:11.347
You could have just told us.
- I didn't think you'd
believe me.

34:11.383 --> 34:13.116
- He tried to tell his mom,

34:13.118 --> 34:14.885
But she assumed
he was imagining things.

34:16.488 --> 34:19.956
- I knew you were detectives,
and I thought if I left clues,

34:20.025 --> 34:22.225
Then maybe you could
find out what happened?

34:24.429 --> 34:26.329
- Nora, can you take
christopher home?

34:26.331 --> 34:28.431
- What? What am I,
the babysitter?

34:28.500 --> 34:29.899
- Just do it, please.

34:31.503 --> 34:33.035
- Do you want to see
what you can find out

34:33.072 --> 34:35.305
About andrea's personal life?
- Thinking the man

34:35.307 --> 34:37.273
In the stairwell was
the boyfriend?
- Exactly.

34:37.342 --> 34:41.177
- So where does that
leave us, frankie?
- In the basement.

34:44.716 --> 34:46.916
- Christopher said that
he saw the man come downstairs,

34:46.952 --> 34:49.118
But he didn't leave
the building until much later.

34:49.154 --> 34:51.388
- No better place to hide
a body than a basement.

34:51.390 --> 34:53.390
- (sighing): I hope
I'm wrong, but...

34:54.493 --> 34:56.526
- Oof. The smell
says you're not.

34:56.661 --> 34:59.329
And it seems to be coming...

35:02.134 --> 35:03.133
From here.

35:03.202 --> 35:06.803
(dramatic music)

35:06.872 --> 35:08.872
Broken neck.

35:08.941 --> 35:11.741
Maybe from a fall down
the stairs, but who pushed her?

35:11.810 --> 35:13.276
- I'd say we're looking
for a redhead.

35:13.345 --> 35:15.879
I'm guessing those came
from whoever did this to her.

35:16.014 --> 35:18.648
- Sure, but not
necessarily a redhead.

35:18.650 --> 35:21.117
These... Are animal hairs.

35:22.821 --> 35:25.221
(dramatic music)

35:25.290 --> 35:27.023
- How dare you?

35:27.025 --> 35:29.225
Just because I make my living
stuffing creatures

35:29.361 --> 35:30.961
Doesn't mean
I could ever kill one.

35:30.963 --> 35:33.496
- So, you had nothing to do
with the death of andrea holmes?

35:33.532 --> 35:35.498
- I had nothing to do
with the death of anyone!

35:35.501 --> 35:37.166
- Then explain these hairs.

35:37.202 --> 35:40.537
- Well, first of all,
that's fur, not hair.

35:40.539 --> 35:42.839
Let me have a look.

35:44.342 --> 35:46.109
It's just as I suspected.

35:46.178 --> 35:48.044
Tell me, detectives,

35:48.046 --> 35:50.914
Do you see any taxidermied
housecats in here?

35:50.983 --> 35:52.516
- Just because there's
nothing out front

35:52.651 --> 35:53.984
Doesn't prove anything.
- Miss drake,

35:54.119 --> 35:56.653
I have not stuffed a cat
since 1916.

35:56.655 --> 36:00.156
I couldn't bear to touch one
after my beloved tabby died.

36:01.426 --> 36:02.726
- Felix.

36:02.861 --> 36:05.027
- They call-- no!
Her name was maxwell!

36:05.063 --> 36:07.063
I called her martha maxwell,
after the founder

36:07.132 --> 36:09.799
Of modern taxidermy.
- That is fascinating.

36:09.935 --> 36:12.668
- (sighing): She ruined me
for every other cat.

36:12.704 --> 36:13.803
I loved her--

36:15.174 --> 36:17.107
- Robert was holding
an orange tabby cat

36:17.242 --> 36:19.676
When I saw him the other day.
- Ooh!

36:19.678 --> 36:23.279
Suddenly shuttering a business!
Yeah, I'd say that's suspicious.

36:23.348 --> 36:26.882
- What are you doing here?
- Hey. Andrea's landlady told me

36:26.919 --> 36:28.851
That she had a beau named robert
up until about a month ago.

36:28.887 --> 36:30.420
- I thought robert
was dating laura.

36:30.555 --> 36:32.822
- He is, but he did mention
going through

36:32.891 --> 36:35.091
A tough breakup recently.
- She couldn't confirm it was

36:35.093 --> 36:37.294
The same robert, so I went to
check it out, and I found this.

36:37.296 --> 36:39.696
- The missing glove.
- I'm thinking robert is the man

36:39.698 --> 36:42.031
That christopher saw
in the stairwell, so I thought

36:42.067 --> 36:43.700
I'd come and check, and then
by the time I got here...

36:43.769 --> 36:46.136
- Cleared out.
- What did you guys
find in the basement?

36:46.271 --> 36:48.605
- Andrea's body.
- Speaking of which, the coroner

36:48.740 --> 36:50.506
Will be here any minute.
I'll see you back at the office.

36:50.542 --> 36:53.143
- Ok. So, how do we
track down robert?

36:53.278 --> 36:55.445
- He practically swooned over
laura when I spoke with him.

36:55.580 --> 36:58.381
- You think
she'll help us find him?
- It's worth a shot. Let's go.

36:58.516 --> 37:00.583
(hammering)

37:03.989 --> 37:05.255
- (sebastian): Damn it!
- Whoa!

37:08.460 --> 37:12.395
I'm guessing this is yours?
- Yeah, it... Got away from me.

37:12.464 --> 37:14.264
There's a really stubborn
nail sticking out

37:14.399 --> 37:16.399
Of the banister, I didn't
want anyone to get hurt.

37:16.534 --> 37:19.135
- So, you're the building's
handyman as well?

37:19.271 --> 37:21.404
- It's already ruined
some lady's dress.

37:21.473 --> 37:24.073
(intriguing music)

37:25.611 --> 37:27.610
- This isn't from a dress.

37:27.646 --> 37:29.845
And robert didn't kill andrea.

37:31.516 --> 37:33.483
- Do you ever say anything
that makes sense?

37:33.618 --> 37:36.686
- It wasn't a man
that christopher saw at all.

37:36.688 --> 37:39.355
- But-- but where
are you going?

37:39.391 --> 37:42.224
- I'm going to start a life
of my own, far away from you.

37:42.261 --> 37:44.827
- Oh, laura, I know we've had
our differences, but please!

37:46.698 --> 37:48.564
- (frankie): Short hair,
dark coat.

37:48.634 --> 37:50.399
- No wonder christopher
mistook her for a man.

37:51.570 --> 37:54.103
- What are you talking about?
Who's christopher?

37:54.139 --> 37:56.439
- The eyewitness who saw you
murder andrea holmes.

37:56.574 --> 37:59.909
-<i> Murder?</i> No!
My laura would never!

38:03.181 --> 38:05.181
- Andrea's... Dead?

38:05.183 --> 38:07.550
And-and laura, you...?

38:08.987 --> 38:10.420
I-I knew you were jealous of our
history, but I didn't think--

38:10.555 --> 38:12.922
- These women don't know what
they're talking about,
sweetheart.

38:12.958 --> 38:15.458
- Actually, we have a very good
idea of what's going on.

38:15.593 --> 38:18.260
When you met robert, you figured
that he was your ticket away

38:18.297 --> 38:19.596
From your overbearing mother.

38:19.731 --> 38:22.699
-<i> Until you ran into his ex,</i>
<i> andrea, all dressed up,</i>

38:22.701 --> 38:25.568
Leaving his office on Tuesday.
- She-she was only there...

38:25.704 --> 38:27.737
Dropping off
the last of my things.

38:27.806 --> 38:29.406
- You thought that she was
trying to maneuver back

38:29.408 --> 38:31.441
Into his life.
- Oh, please!

38:31.443 --> 38:33.076
- Instead of just
telling robert about it,

38:33.145 --> 38:35.678
You waited until after her
interview at the watchmaker's.

38:35.681 --> 38:37.614
- (frankie):<i> You confronted her,</i>
<i>told her to leave robert alone.</i>

38:37.749 --> 38:40.015
<i> One thing led to another,</i>
<i> and the next thing you know,</i>

38:40.052 --> 38:41.684
<i>She ends up dead at your feet.</i>

38:41.753 --> 38:43.987
You convinced robert to run away
with you because you're afraid

38:44.122 --> 38:45.555
Someone's going to
find out what you did.

38:45.690 --> 38:47.690
- Is this-- is this all true?

38:47.759 --> 38:50.226
Laura?
- Not now, mother, not now.

38:51.897 --> 38:55.031
Nice story.
Where's your proof?

38:55.033 --> 38:57.500
- How does laura
get along with felix?

38:57.569 --> 38:59.502
- She... She loves him,

38:59.538 --> 39:01.437
But what does that have
to do with anything?

39:01.506 --> 39:03.373
- Well, we found cat hair
all over andrea's body.

39:03.442 --> 39:06.041
- That doesn't prove anything.
- No, but this does.

39:06.078 --> 39:07.944
Found at the scene
of the crime.

39:07.946 --> 39:10.246
Why don't we take a look
at that beautiful coat of yours

39:10.282 --> 39:11.915
And see if there's any
recent repairs?

39:12.050 --> 39:14.351
- Oh, dear lord!
Sweet jesus--

39:14.486 --> 39:15.919
- Mother!
- What are we gonna do?

39:15.921 --> 39:16.986
- Mother!

39:17.055 --> 39:18.321
- I'll call your uncle saul.
He knows a good lawyer--

39:18.456 --> 39:20.323
- Mother, will you
please shut up!

39:21.793 --> 39:24.394
(siren wailing)

39:24.396 --> 39:26.863
Take me to the station.
At least in jail

39:26.932 --> 39:28.731
I won't have to listen
to all her fussing.

39:43.014 --> 39:45.148
- This headpiece is a lot
heavier than I expected.

39:45.217 --> 39:47.617
- Well, at least
your armour isn't chafing.

39:47.686 --> 39:49.952
- Ah, the perils of being
the goddess of war!

39:50.021 --> 39:52.422
I'm sure alessandro will
sweep you out of that party

39:52.557 --> 39:55.358
And that armour
as soon as possible.

39:55.427 --> 39:58.828
(giggling)
- who's got time for mortal men?

39:58.963 --> 40:00.563
Personally,
I'm looking for something

40:00.632 --> 40:03.700
A little more godlike
in my next suitor.

40:03.702 --> 40:05.234
- And who are you
supposed to be?

40:05.270 --> 40:07.837
- Aphrodite, obviously!

40:07.873 --> 40:10.106
- I thought you had
sworn off love.

40:10.108 --> 40:13.309
- Well, I tried your costume on
when I was here the other night,

40:13.345 --> 40:15.979
And I thought, "wouldn't
it be fun to coordinate?"

40:15.981 --> 40:17.914
And speaking of which,

40:17.916 --> 40:21.518
What's that beefcake italian
boyfriend of yours coming as?

40:21.653 --> 40:23.720
Ares? Adonis?

40:23.855 --> 40:26.689
Oh! Ooh! Ooh! Ah... Hercules?

40:26.691 --> 40:29.592
- If intel from
my sources is correct,

40:29.727 --> 40:32.028
He will arrive
dressed as odysseus.

40:32.163 --> 40:33.662
(all laughing)

40:33.698 --> 40:36.466
Which only leaves
one question. Where's mary?

40:36.535 --> 40:38.801
- She didn't come with you?
- I haven't seen her all day.

40:38.804 --> 40:39.869
- Boo!

40:39.871 --> 40:42.405
(laughing)
- mary, you scared me!

40:42.540 --> 40:44.941
- I know! I'm just trying
to conquer my fears.

40:44.943 --> 40:46.342
- Oh, good!

40:46.478 --> 40:48.545
(knocking on door)
must be our ride.

40:48.680 --> 40:50.312
- Oh!
(flo laughing)

40:53.785 --> 40:56.419
No, it's our ghost.
- My mom told me

40:56.488 --> 40:58.288
You found that bad man
from the stairwell...

40:58.423 --> 41:01.023
Except the bad man
was really a lady?

41:01.092 --> 41:03.226
- That's right.
- Sorry I was wrong about that.

41:03.295 --> 41:05.495
And for all
the trouble I caused.

41:05.497 --> 41:06.762
- You helped us catch a killer.

41:06.798 --> 41:08.898
You have nothing
to be sorry for.

41:09.033 --> 41:11.834
- That may be true,
but these might help you

41:11.837 --> 41:13.369
See a little more clearly
next time.

41:13.405 --> 41:16.606
- For me? Thanks!

41:16.608 --> 41:18.774
(flo chuckling)

41:22.247 --> 41:24.780
- You really don't do things
by half, do you?

41:24.850 --> 41:27.183
- Where's the fun in that?

41:32.924 --> 41:35.558
- (whispering): Oh my god!
(mouth popping)

41:35.693 --> 41:38.728
- Is that your new neighbour?
- That is sebastian.

41:39.764 --> 41:41.798
- Well, he can bevel
my edges any time.

41:41.933 --> 41:43.466
Get it, 'cause
he's a carpenter?

41:43.468 --> 41:45.601
- Yes, I get it.

41:45.637 --> 41:49.739
I will be right back.
(all laughing)

41:55.813 --> 41:58.481
- Knocking.
That's an improvement.

41:58.483 --> 42:00.382
- I deserve that.

42:01.686 --> 42:05.555
Look, I just-- I wanted
to apologize for my...

42:05.690 --> 42:06.889
- Insane behaviour?

42:07.926 --> 42:09.826
- I was gonna say
"unneighbourly".

42:09.828 --> 42:12.095
- Oh, it was definitely
closer to insane.

42:12.230 --> 42:14.230
- Fine, but you were
being cagey.

42:14.232 --> 42:17.767
- Yeah, I'm just not a big fan
of people knowing my business.

42:17.769 --> 42:20.636
- Is that why you go around
advertising that you're married?

42:21.940 --> 42:23.238
- Maybe.

42:24.375 --> 42:25.608
- Well.

42:27.412 --> 42:29.712
Is this a home brew?
- Maybe.

42:29.847 --> 42:32.915
Consider it a "welcome
to the building" present.

42:34.252 --> 42:37.120
- You're a very unusual woman,
you know that?

42:37.122 --> 42:39.655
- I'll take unusual
over insane any day.

42:40.725 --> 42:42.859
- Do you wanna maybe...

42:42.861 --> 42:44.527
- (alessandro): Ah!
There you are!

42:44.662 --> 42:46.362
The car is waiting, goddess.

42:46.364 --> 42:48.297
- I'll be right there.

42:53.305 --> 42:54.536
See you around?

42:55.340 --> 42:56.472
- Maybe.

43:04.649 --> 43:08.618
(soft flute playing)

43:15.060 --> 43:17.426
