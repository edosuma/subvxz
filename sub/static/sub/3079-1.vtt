You might go
get a girl pregnant
with a shirt like that on.

my shirt off first,

more of a virgin now

we started dating

It is.
You're like
a super-virgin.

And so do you.
And we need to fix that.
Dude, we are due.

04:47.454 --> 04:52.491

05:28.896 --> 05:31.997

This relationship's
not progressing
quickly enough,

05:37.905 --> 05:39.805
physically-speaking.

05:39.807 --> 05:42.674
Look at you,
and then look at me.

05:42.676 --> 05:46.611
You're beautiful,
and I'm just
kind of a mess.

05:46.613 --> 05:49.648
Are you breaking up
with me because I won't
have sex with you?

05:49.650 --> 05:53.018
You call it sex.
I call it a physical
expression of our bond.

05:53.020 --> 05:55.754
I haven't
showered in six days.

05:55.756 --> 05:58.657
Like Indians
becoming blood brothers,

05:58.659 --> 06:01.493
or football teammates
getting matching tattoos.

06:01.495 --> 06:03.395
Except sex isn't
even as permanent
as a tattoo.

It's nine minutes,
tops.

06:04.898 --> 06:07.099

06:10.903 --> 06:13.672
That's what I am to you?
A hole for you
to go in and out of?

06:13.674 --> 06:15.540
No, no, no.

06:15.542 --> 06:19.144
I value the person
built around that hole.

06:20.580 --> 06:22.581
I'm really sorry.

06:22.583 --> 06:25.751
Okay. I get it.

06:25.753 --> 06:28.620
Are we okay? Yeah?
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

06:28.622 --> 06:29.721
Can I get a little
hug going on here?

06:31.958 --> 06:34.159
AVA: You can be
a real asshole,
you know that?

06:34.161 --> 06:36.762
I could get any
fucking guy I want!

06:36.764 --> 06:40.465
I'm so much hotter than you!
Do you even fucking
realize how hot I am?

06:40.467 --> 06:41.933
Not the gummy bears.

06:41.935 --> 06:44.836
Why don't you just
go outside and chill out
for a sec?

06:44.838 --> 06:47.105
Fuck you, Matty.
Why don't you guys
fucking blow each other?

06:47.107 --> 06:49.074
It's the most action
you're ever
gonna get anyway.

06:55.882 --> 06:57.582
How was your breakup?

07:02.722 --> 07:05.157
I can't believe we wasted
so much time with those two.

07:05.159 --> 07:08.727
The high school
chapter of our sexual lives
is rapidly coming to a close.

07:08.729 --> 07:10.162
We need to begin phase two.

07:10.164 --> 07:13.899
We need to get
our dicks wet by prom.

07:13.901 --> 07:15.500
Mmm. I don't approve
of that language at all.

07:15.502 --> 07:18.470
I'm going crazy, dude.
18 years and nothing?

07:18.472 --> 07:21.773
I don't want to wake
up 20 years from now
with regrets.

07:21.775 --> 07:25.010
"Hey, buddy,
sorry I didn't put
you in more things."

07:26.979 --> 07:29.448
Oops.
Whoa!

07:29.450 --> 07:32.984
Man! That is a metric
ton of weed. Shit!

07:32.986 --> 07:35.220
If we eat that whole brownie,
we're gonna immediately
grow dreadlocks.

07:42.195 --> 07:45.797
We should go to cooking
school and learn how
to make real weed cuisine.

07:45.799 --> 07:50.001
I'm talking
leg of lamb with a weed
reduction sauce or some shit.

07:50.003 --> 07:51.903
Dude.

07:51.905 --> 07:56.475
What! I have a genius idea.
We should save this brownie

07:56.477 --> 08:00.011
and eat it as a reward
for getting laid at prom.

08:00.013 --> 08:03.482
Okay. So, it's like our pot
at the end of the rainbow.

08:03.484 --> 08:06.184
Except instead
of a pot full of gold,
it's a pot full of pot.

08:06.186 --> 08:07.886
Yeah, I think that was
implied with what I said.

08:07.888 --> 08:10.055
Dude, I got it
all planned out!

08:10.057 --> 08:14.125
We go to prom,
have sex, eat this brownie,
be high for a week straight.

08:14.127 --> 08:16.628
Then we go to college.
People are gonna be like,

08:16.630 --> 08:19.865
"Those two guys
are so awesome they're
definitely not virgins."

08:19.867 --> 08:23.535
Yeah, then we move back here,
we get dead-end jobs,

08:23.537 --> 08:26.071
we retire,
and we fucking die.

08:26.073 --> 08:27.873
If we time it right,
we make it a double funeral.

08:27.875 --> 08:29.774
Oh, my God.
That's a great plan.

08:33.913 --> 08:35.647
Isn't your dad
going to see this?

08:35.649 --> 08:37.549
Oh, he's a pussycat.
He'll love it.

08:37.551 --> 08:40.751
And he's got
a new girlfriend now,
so he's a happy boy.

08:40.754 --> 08:42.754
All right, man,
I'm gonna head out,

08:42.756 --> 08:45.290
but I will see you tomorrow
at band practice.

08:45.292 --> 08:46.791
All right, dude.
All right.

08:52.999 --> 08:55.300
Hey, you want
to go for a drive?

08:55.302 --> 08:57.903
Um, I was just gonna go
to sleep after finishing
this pair of tits.

08:57.905 --> 08:59.738
(MUMBLES)

08:59.740 --> 09:01.606
We should definitely
go for a drive.

09:14.120 --> 09:15.820
Yo, something
wrong, dude?

09:15.822 --> 09:18.156
No, just going
for a drive.

09:26.966 --> 09:28.266
(SIGHS)

09:32.705 --> 09:36.241
All right, listen, man.
All this talking
we've been doing

09:36.243 --> 09:41.279
about sex, and the future,
and the rest of our
lives and all that shit

09:41.281 --> 09:43.114
has got me feeling
a little guilty.

09:43.116 --> 09:45.684
Why?

09:45.686 --> 09:49.220
Look, you're
my best friend.
You know that.

09:49.222 --> 09:52.657
And so,
I owe this to you.

09:52.659 --> 09:53.992
Yeah, what is it?

09:56.963 --> 09:58.096
I'm a gay dude.

09:59.098 --> 10:00.165
What?

10:01.634 --> 10:03.101
I'm a gay dude.

10:04.804 --> 10:06.171
I'm a gay.

10:08.641 --> 10:15.013
Like "gay" gay?
Like "dicks in butts"
gay or "retarded" gay?

10:15.015 --> 10:18.183
Like, "Man, Nicolas Cage
movies are gay."

10:18.185 --> 10:22.854
No, like "I'm a dude
who's attracted
to other dudes" gay.

10:22.856 --> 10:25.323
What? No, you're
just a dude.

10:25.325 --> 10:27.258
No, exactly.
A gay dude.

10:29.362 --> 10:32.297
Fuck. You're all
out of shape and shit.

10:32.299 --> 10:34.366
Really? No, dude,
I fucking know.

10:34.368 --> 10:37.135
Look, I'm not into curtains.
I've never watched the Tonys.

10:37.137 --> 10:40.105
I'm never gonna wear
a deep V-neck t-shirt,

10:40.107 --> 10:42.140
but I am gay.

10:42.142 --> 10:45.176
When did you first
realize this? Is this
a recent development?

10:45.178 --> 10:46.945
No. Fuck, no.

10:46.947 --> 10:49.247
Remember when we were kids,
six or seven years old,

10:49.249 --> 10:51.349
we used to give that guy
half of our sandwiches

10:51.351 --> 10:52.851
through the chain-link
fence at school?

10:52.853 --> 10:55.053
Yeah, that guy
was a homeless guy.

10:55.055 --> 10:57.822
Yeah, and I kind of
had a crush on him.

10:57.824 --> 11:00.291
You were gay for
the homeless guy?

11:00.293 --> 11:02.427
He was ruggedly handsome.

11:02.429 --> 11:05.063
You wanted to fuck a hobo
when you were seven?

11:05.065 --> 11:06.297
That's what
you're telling me?

11:06.299 --> 11:08.033
That's what
I'm telling you, man.

11:08.035 --> 11:11.102
I wanted to feel the touch
of his dirty, hobo hands.

11:11.104 --> 11:16.374
This is crazy!
You've dated more
girls than I have!

11:16.376 --> 11:18.243
I think that's more
of a you-problem,
to be honest.

11:18.245 --> 11:20.345
Did you tell Em?
Did you tell her
before you told me?

11:20.347 --> 11:23.014
Yeah. Yeah.
Look, dude,
she's super-cool.

11:23.016 --> 11:25.016
I don't want
to fuck up her life with
unnecessary falsehoods.

11:26.018 --> 11:27.919
Wow. Fuck.

11:30.089 --> 11:31.222
You're a gay dude.

11:31.224 --> 11:33.425
Yeah, I'm a gay dude.

thing's out the window.

11:43.437 --> 11:45.837
No, I want to eat
that brownie.

have broken up with Ava
without our whole big plan.

11:47.207 --> 11:48.406

11:48.408 --> 11:50.141
Yeah, and so out
of your league.

11:50.143 --> 11:52.811
Dude, have you seen her boobs
and her stomach area?

11:52.813 --> 11:55.847
Her stomach is almost
as hot as her boobs.

11:57.950 --> 12:01.086
Right? Can you
even wrap your brain
around that?

12:01.088 --> 12:05.490
Yeah, yeah.
I mean, it's
a tight stomach.

12:05.492 --> 12:08.226
I don't know
what to tell you.
It's nice.

12:09.795 --> 12:12.864
No, no, no. Dude,
this is fine. It's good.

12:12.866 --> 12:14.999

Yeah.

about the thing.

The thing about the gayness
in his "pay-nis."

I said "pay-nis."
That was weird.

I'm glad he told you.

A cake, you should
get him a cake.

You're gonna want some E.

23:02.548 --> 23:04.115
No, we don't want
any ecstasy.

23:04.117 --> 23:07.518
I'll get you some E,
and then we'll talk.

23:07.520 --> 23:08.652
Whoo!

23:08.654 --> 23:10.588
E for enthusiasm.
Certainly.

23:14.459 --> 23:15.593
This is useless.

23:15.595 --> 23:17.428
You're super-lucky.

23:17.430 --> 23:20.398
When you're gay,
you get nonstop
sex all the time.

23:20.400 --> 23:22.166
No strings attached.
It's amazing.

23:22.168 --> 23:25.035
I'm not gonna just
have sex with anyone
because I'm gay.

23:25.037 --> 23:26.737
I'm gay.
I'm not a whore.

23:26.739 --> 23:28.739
I'm back
with your ecstasy,
boys!

23:28.741 --> 23:31.509
Jared,
we were very specific.
We don't want it.

23:31.511 --> 23:34.078
Have you even
tried it before?

23:34.080 --> 23:37.715
Oh, my God! Uh-oh.
You're really good
at dancing.

23:37.717 --> 23:39.083
I don't think
I'm dancing.

23:39.085 --> 23:42.052
Jared! Get out of here.
Leave those guys alone.

23:42.054 --> 23:44.789
Mr. Vernon? You're here.

23:45.791 --> 23:48.092
Yeah, so are you.

23:48.094 --> 23:51.796
We're all here.

23:51.798 --> 23:55.633
Chris, you remember
Michael and Matty
from school?

23:55.635 --> 23:56.767
Hey, guys.

23:56.769 --> 23:58.736
Mr. Dennis.

23:58.738 --> 24:00.438
You used to be
in my fourth period.

24:00.440 --> 24:02.173
You gave me a C.

24:05.610 --> 24:07.745
So, you're not
gonna talk about this
to anyone?

24:07.747 --> 24:09.680
Oh, no, of course not.

24:09.682 --> 24:11.949
Though I think
it'd be a good idea
if you guys went home.

24:11.951 --> 24:14.752
I can't really talk
to you while you're
underage drinking.

24:14.754 --> 24:16.654
Of course.
Yeah.

24:16.656 --> 24:18.789
And it would be
nice to keep this quiet

24:18.791 --> 24:20.858
on both ends,
if that makes sense.

24:20.860 --> 24:23.694
Totally understand.
Yeah.

24:23.696 --> 24:25.496
I really look
forward to not making

24:25.498 --> 24:27.498
eye contact with you
tomorrow at school.

24:28.700 --> 24:31.168
Dude, Mr. Vernon.
I had no idea.

24:31.170 --> 24:34.505
Yeah, and Mr. Dennis.
You think they've
done it at school?

24:34.507 --> 24:36.140
Come on, man.

24:36.142 --> 24:38.075
By the way,
I appreciate the sentiment,

24:38.077 --> 24:41.178
but this is
the worst and only gay bar
I've ever been to.

MICHAEL:
What were you doing?

24:52.191 --> 24:54.158
I'm driving, man.
It's not my fault

24:54.160 --> 24:55.960
that you drive the smallest
car in the universe.

24:55.962 --> 24:58.162
What is that?
Is that a Diet Kia?

24:58.164 --> 25:00.130
You could have
really injured us.

25:00.132 --> 25:02.199
Ha-ha-ho! Ho-ho.
You just said "could have."

25:02.201 --> 25:05.503
You've officially acknowledged
that no harm has been done.
Okay.

25:05.505 --> 25:08.172
This thing is trashed.
I'm gonna need a new thing.

25:08.174 --> 25:10.074
Look at this!

25:10.076 --> 25:13.210
This is the time
when we get our
insurance information.

25:13.212 --> 25:15.579
Um... Uh-uh-uh...

25:15.581 --> 25:18.015
No. I'm gonna go
ahead and leave now.
Okay?

25:18.017 --> 25:20.684
Dude. Come on!
What the fuck?

25:21.686 --> 25:23.587
Yo!
Hey! Stop!

25:23.589 --> 25:24.788
You're not gonna
run me over.

25:27.826 --> 25:29.193
Be cool.

25:29.195 --> 25:30.928
Let's talk.
Chill, man.

25:30.930 --> 25:32.897
I'm totally chill.
Super chill.
I'm very cool.

25:34.165 --> 25:35.266
You smell
like an old tent.

25:35.268 --> 25:36.667
What's wrong with you?

25:36.669 --> 25:37.902
Honestly, I have
a Baconator in the car,

25:37.904 --> 25:39.069
and I want to get
home and eat it.

25:39.071 --> 25:40.838
What the fuck
is a Baconator?

25:40.840 --> 25:42.773
It's a really
delicious sandwich
from Wendy's.

25:44.142 --> 25:46.176
Dude, just give me
your information.

25:46.178 --> 25:48.312
Mike, maybe
we should just
call the cops.

25:48.314 --> 25:50.948
We can't call the cops.
We're underage,
and we had a bunch of beers.

25:52.083 --> 25:54.218
Did you just push me?
Maybe.

25:54.220 --> 25:56.787
Okay. Then it's
gonna be go time.

25:56.789 --> 25:58.956

You tripped me?

26:02.562 --> 26:04.028
GREG: Yeah, I did.

26:04.030 --> 26:06.597
You tripped me?
Who the fuck trips people?

26:06.599 --> 26:09.633
I do. I took a vow
recently that I would
stop punching people,

26:09.635 --> 26:11.902
because I was
doing that too much.

26:11.904 --> 26:14.805
I'm trying to be
less violent in general.
So, okay.

26:14.807 --> 26:16.774

really well.

I think that's
the audition song.

26:40.266 --> 26:42.166
Yeah, yeah. Well,

26:42.168 --> 26:44.201
Mike, we've actually
been having some

26:44.203 --> 26:46.136
discussions about
the direction of the band.

26:46.138 --> 26:47.738
What does that mean?

26:47.740 --> 26:49.807
Well, we've been talking,

26:49.809 --> 26:51.842
and we think it's
about time we add

26:51.844 --> 26:53.944
some songs
with vocals
to the set list.

26:53.946 --> 26:56.046
Like <i> Cheers</i> and

<i>Saved by the Bell:</i>
<i>College Years.</i>

26:59.085 --> 27:00.951
Yeah, the list
goes on and on.

27:00.953 --> 27:02.987
And more importantly,
Mr. Vernon
straight-up told me,

27:02.989 --> 27:06.156
"You're not playing prom
unless you have a singer."

27:06.158 --> 27:09.193
Yeah, well, that's not
what we are. That's
not what we do.

27:09.195 --> 27:11.095
Who would even sing?
You would.

27:11.097 --> 27:13.964
What? No, I can't.

27:13.966 --> 27:15.799
You have
a beautiful voice, man.

of that musical
in third grade.

33:35.414 --> 33:37.381
I knew it!
You're all
chatty and shit.

33:37.383 --> 33:38.749
I killed a bunch
of my dad's bourbon.

33:38.751 --> 33:40.450
Nice.

33:40.452 --> 33:42.519
And then you came over.

33:42.521 --> 33:46.790
And now we're here
with cheese and bread.

33:46.792 --> 33:49.559
You, me, cheese,
bread here.

33:52.030 --> 33:53.263
(CHUCKLES)

33:55.767 --> 33:57.801
Life sucks.

34:00.204 --> 34:01.705
Yeah, life sucks.

34:04.208 --> 34:06.376
But I guess
sometimes it doesn't.

34:20.291 --> 34:21.425
Wait, wait, wait.

34:22.659 --> 34:24.261
What are we doing?

34:25.496 --> 34:27.731
I don't know.
What are you doing?

34:29.467 --> 34:31.068
I don't know.

34:46.684 --> 34:47.818
What are you doing?

34:47.820 --> 34:48.819
Oh, hey.

34:49.821 --> 34:51.521
Ahhh.

34:52.623 --> 34:53.824
I should go.

34:53.826 --> 34:55.125
Yeah, you should.

34:55.127 --> 34:56.126
Yeah.

34:57.195 --> 35:00.730
My clothes are over there.

35:01.732 --> 35:03.733
So can you turn around?

35:05.336 --> 35:06.403
Okay.

35:15.813 --> 35:17.414
Should we talk
about what
happened last night?

35:18.416 --> 35:19.683
We were fucked up.

35:22.620 --> 35:25.789
We are, in general,
fucked up.

35:25.791 --> 35:29.392
If it had to be with a girl,
I'm glad it was with you.

35:29.394 --> 35:30.594
Thank you?

35:31.696 --> 35:33.163
(CHUCKLES)

35:41.906 --> 35:42.906
Yeah.

35:44.275 --> 35:45.342
Bye.

35:52.617 --> 35:55.152
Reading? I love books.

35:55.154 --> 35:57.921
Books are
like word movies.

35:57.923 --> 36:00.223
What do you want,
Michael?

36:00.225 --> 36:03.793
Nothing. Just two friends
hanging out, talking,
swapping stories.

36:03.795 --> 36:06.163
You just spit on me.
Did I?

36:06.165 --> 36:08.398
Sorry. Sometimes that
happens when I start
talking too fast.

36:08.400 --> 36:11.368
I think some
of it got in my mouth.

36:11.370 --> 36:12.602
Do you wanna go
to prom with me?

36:12.604 --> 36:13.770
What? No.

36:16.207 --> 36:20.210
Okay, I know I dumped
you, and that was
probably painful,

36:20.212 --> 36:22.879
but I realized
that was a mistake,

36:22.881 --> 36:24.681
and I think we
can get past that.

36:25.683 --> 36:26.750
I'm going with Anthony.

36:26.752 --> 36:28.818
Really?

36:28.820 --> 36:33.323
Or Lucas or Damien.
There's a lot of balls
in the air right now.

36:33.325 --> 36:35.492
There are?
What happened?

36:35.494 --> 36:37.594
I'm dating around.

36:37.596 --> 36:40.797
Dating around?
You don't date around.

36:40.799 --> 36:42.365
That's not... (STUTTERS)

36:44.602 --> 36:46.436
We didn't even
get past third base.

36:46.438 --> 36:49.506
We never got past second.

36:49.508 --> 36:52.943
It's an imprecise
metaphorical system.
It's open to interpretation.

36:52.945 --> 36:54.611
You just spit
on me again.

36:54.613 --> 36:56.379
Sorry.

36:56.381 --> 36:57.814
I have to go.
I'm late for color guard.

36:57.816 --> 37:00.717
You can't guard colors.
It's a stupid name.

37:02.286 --> 37:04.554
It should be
called flag spinning.

37:07.858 --> 37:09.793
Hey, welcome to
Catch-a-Burger. Those are
sweet cargo shorts.

37:09.795 --> 37:11.294
Thank you.

37:11.296 --> 37:13.330
Can I take your order?
My name is Pete.

37:13.332 --> 37:15.398
Yes, I would like a
Bacon Symphony and
a large order of fries.

37:15.400 --> 37:16.866
Okay. $5.66.

37:16.868 --> 37:18.235
Here you go.

37:19.704 --> 37:21.404
And can I give
your change

37:21.406 --> 37:23.540
to the Catch-a-Burger
Courageous Kids program?

37:23.542 --> 37:24.941
No, thank you.
I'll just take the change.

37:24.943 --> 37:27.978
I guess you can't
afford the 34 cents?

37:27.980 --> 37:29.679
Or you wanted
to put it to better use

37:29.681 --> 37:30.914
than giving it
to courageous kids?

37:34.685 --> 37:37.787
Yeah, I'll give my money
to the kids' program. Sure.

37:37.789 --> 37:39.556
For an additional
two dollars,

37:39.558 --> 37:42.459
I can make you
a Catch-a-Burger
Courageous Kids Ambassador.

37:42.461 --> 37:44.527
Thank you,
but I would just
like to eat my food.

37:44.529 --> 37:46.730
Yeah, yeah.

37:46.732 --> 37:48.298
Hey, do you have parents?

37:48.300 --> 37:49.599
Yeah, of course.
Everyone has parents.

37:49.601 --> 37:51.935
Not the Catch-a-Burger
Courageous Kids.

37:51.937 --> 37:54.371
They're orphans, man.
That's what makes
them so courageous.

37:54.373 --> 37:55.805
It's two dollars?
It's two dollars.

37:55.807 --> 37:57.574
Yeah, I have two dollars.
Thanks so much.

37:57.576 --> 38:00.377
Just put it in the box.
Fill out one
of those guys for me.

38:00.379 --> 38:02.479
Can I order while
he's doing this?

38:02.481 --> 38:03.813
Yeah.
Okay.

38:03.815 --> 38:05.615
Hey, you know what
would be really cool?

38:05.617 --> 38:07.617
If you would do
what he's doing
preemptively.

38:07.619 --> 38:09.552
It's just two bucks.
Really help a lot of kids.

38:09.554 --> 38:11.688
I haven't
ordered yet.

38:11.690 --> 38:14.557
Big man here is doing it,
and he looks like he
has fucking no money.

38:14.559 --> 38:15.759
Okay, let's do it.

38:15.761 --> 38:17.060
Thanks, bro.

38:20.298 --> 38:21.798
I met you
at the place before.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.433
Yes,
I struck you
with my truck.

38:23.435 --> 38:25.869
Hey, do you guys
have little brothers?

38:25.871 --> 38:27.837
I have an older brother.

38:27.839 --> 38:29.439
No, I'm talking
about the Big Brother
Big Sister program.

38:29.441 --> 38:30.640
You guys are
the right age for it.

38:30.642 --> 38:32.742
I've been doing
it for three years,

38:32.744 --> 38:35.378
and it has been
the best experience
of my whole life.

38:35.380 --> 38:37.781
It really changed me.

38:37.783 --> 38:39.416
I gotta tell you
about my little brother,
Phiram.

38:39.418 --> 38:40.750
He's from Cambodia.

38:40.752 --> 38:43.053
He came over here on a boat
when he was a baby.

38:43.055 --> 38:45.689
He lost his father
when he was two.

38:48.492 --> 38:51.328
Now he plays
the fucking cello, man.
(EXHALES)

38:51.330 --> 38:52.662
Imagine that!

38:56.701 --> 38:58.535
That guy's incredible.

38:58.537 --> 39:00.804
That guy's like a drug dealer
for the concept of charity.

39:02.873 --> 39:05.975
Um, I think I owe you
an apology for my behavior
the other night.

39:05.977 --> 39:07.944
I was not
in a good place.

39:07.946 --> 39:09.879
I'd just taken
my dog to the vet

39:09.881 --> 39:12.615
because he ate
an entire soccer ball.

39:12.617 --> 39:14.651
Oh, man.

39:14.653 --> 39:17.987
Well, I'm sorry, too.
My buddy gets
really nervous sometimes.

39:17.989 --> 39:19.489
Or all the time.

39:19.491 --> 39:21.424
I'm very intimidating.

39:21.426 --> 39:23.126
Yeah, I'm by far
the toughest guy
you're ever

39:23.128 --> 39:25.562
gonna meet outside
Reflections, okay?

39:25.564 --> 39:27.030
Right here. All right.

39:28.999 --> 39:30.800
You like that place?
You like that scene?

39:32.670 --> 39:35.605
It was interesting. Yeah.

39:35.607 --> 39:37.640
It was my first
time there.

39:37.642 --> 39:43.847
Is that a place
that you often are
around or inside of?

39:43.849 --> 39:45.949
Well,
it's not much
on ambience,

39:45.951 --> 39:48.418
but they do have
this one incredible craft
beer that you gotta try.

39:48.420 --> 39:51.521
It's not to be missed.
It's called Bud Light.

39:51.523 --> 39:53.089
It's so good.

39:53.091 --> 39:54.624
I'm Greg.

39:54.626 --> 39:55.892
I'm Matty.
Nice to meet you.

39:55.894 --> 39:57.994
(CELL PHONE RINGS)
Nice to meet you.

39:57.996 --> 40:00.830
PETE: Let me tell you
about my little brother,
Phiram.

40:00.832 --> 40:02.065
Do you wanna watch
this happen one more time?

40:02.067 --> 40:03.066
Yes.
Okay.

40:05.703 --> 40:07.704
Em! Em!

40:09.140 --> 40:10.140
Hey.

40:12.143 --> 40:13.843
Can you do me
a huge favor?
What?

40:13.845 --> 40:15.478
I need a ride.

40:15.480 --> 40:17.814
Thanks for driving
me to the shop.

40:17.816 --> 40:19.582
No problem.

40:19.584 --> 40:21.418
I got in an accident
the day I got my license,

40:21.420 --> 40:22.585
and my parents
totally freaked out,

40:22.587 --> 40:24.587
so I know what it's like.

40:24.589 --> 40:25.722
How many accidents
have you been in?

40:26.724 --> 40:28.691
Five or six.

40:28.693 --> 40:30.760
Wait, seriously?
Should I be
driving with you?

40:30.762 --> 40:32.495
Shit, I got a text.
Hold on.

40:32.497 --> 40:33.830
No, no, no!

40:33.832 --> 40:35.198
(LAUGHS)

40:35.200 --> 40:38.001
I'm kidding.
I've only been in four.

40:38.003 --> 40:39.436
Watch the road, please!
(CHUCKLES)

40:44.108 --> 40:45.742
Hey, have you
talked to Matty recently?

40:45.744 --> 40:47.710
No.

40:47.712 --> 40:48.978
He's been acting
really weird.

40:48.980 --> 40:51.181
Really?

40:51.183 --> 40:55.118
Yeah. I mean,
I know it's not an easy time,
but... I don't know.

40:59.523 --> 41:01.191
(SPEAKS IN SPANISH)

41:01.193 --> 41:03.226
No English?
Can you...

41:03.228 --> 41:08.097
The bumper,
bumpero, is no good.
It needs changing.

41:08.099 --> 41:10.934
Come back.
You can't just do this.
My bumper is messed up.

41:10.936 --> 41:12.769
Does anyone
here speak English?

41:12.771 --> 41:14.471
EM: What's going on?

41:14.473 --> 41:18.475
I'm screwed.
No one here
speaks any English.

41:18.477 --> 41:20.109
So you're just
gonna drive around

41:20.111 --> 41:22.846
with a big, old, red bumper
on your little periwinkle car?

41:23.848 --> 41:25.748
It's gunmetal.

41:25.750 --> 41:28.251
And it might not be so
bad if I drive at night.

41:28.253 --> 41:30.687
No, they messed up your car.
That's unacceptable.

41:30.689 --> 41:31.754
Excuse me.

41:31.756 --> 41:33.823
(SPEAKS IN SPANISH)

41:35.226 --> 41:36.559
You don't have to...

41:36.561 --> 41:37.760
(SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

41:38.762 --> 41:40.029
Don't yell at him.

41:40.031 --> 41:42.031
(SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

41:44.869 --> 41:46.102
Thank you.

41:46.104 --> 41:48.104
(SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

41:51.008 --> 41:53.109
(CROWD CHEERING)

41:55.145 --> 41:57.747
This shit is so much better
than that American shit.

41:57.749 --> 41:59.916
These guys are Mexican.
They are hard-core.

42:01.819 --> 42:03.686
Who's this guy?

42:03.688 --> 42:06.189
That is the Super <i> Gato.</i>

42:06.191 --> 42:07.190
He's a man/cat thing.

42:07.192 --> 42:08.658
MATTY: Shit.

42:08.660 --> 42:10.226
His thing is when
he beats somebody,

42:10.228 --> 42:12.862
he pours milk on them,
and then he licks it off.

42:12.864 --> 42:14.898
He calls it
"licking the <i> leche."</i>

42:14.900 --> 42:15.899
No, I'm not into that.

42:15.901 --> 42:16.966
It's not okay.

42:16.968 --> 42:19.035
It's weird.

42:19.037 --> 42:20.270
What about this
gentleman right here?

42:20.272 --> 42:22.939
Yeah! Yeah!

42:22.941 --> 42:26.543
That's <i> El Cientifico Loco,</i>
<i>the Mad Scientist.</i>
<i>He's my favorite.</i>

42:26.545 --> 42:29.579
He's the Mexican version
of Stephen Hawking.

42:29.581 --> 42:32.115
He rolls around
the ring in his little chair,
acting like a bitch,

42:32.117 --> 42:34.250
and then he gets bullied.

42:34.252 --> 42:36.686
He just rises up
and regulates.
It's awesome.

42:38.556 --> 42:40.256
Dude, how are you
a gay guy?

42:43.027 --> 42:45.261
I don't know.
I just am.

42:45.263 --> 42:47.130
How are you
a gay guy?

42:47.132 --> 42:48.331
I don't know, man.

43:01.812 --> 43:02.946
This is fun.
It's a good time.

43:02.948 --> 43:04.647
Yeah.

43:04.649 --> 43:07.083
I enjoy hanging
out with you, man.

43:08.352 --> 43:13.656
You're a good friend-type
dude-person thing.

43:13.658 --> 43:15.592
Thank you, Matt.

43:15.594 --> 43:17.827
Yes.

43:17.829 --> 43:22.131
It's easy to get a quick lay,
but the friendship part
is hard to come by.

43:25.803 --> 43:27.837
Yeah! Yeah!

43:27.839 --> 43:29.238
That's it!
Fuck him up!

43:29.240 --> 43:31.207
(CROWD CHEERING)

43:35.846 --> 43:36.879
Oh, shit!

43:46.857 --> 43:48.358
Yeah!

43:51.362 --> 43:52.362
That's a pin!

43:54.732 --> 43:57.734
Fuck, yeah!
Fuck you, cat!

43:57.736 --> 43:59.202
Here comes
the robot voice.
What?

43:59.204 --> 44:00.370
Here comes the robot voice.

44:00.372 --> 44:02.639
Just hold on.
Hold on. And...

44:02.641 --> 44:03.940
EL CIENTIFICO
LOCO'S ROBOT VOICE:
<i>Soy el campeon.</i>

44:07.978 --> 44:09.979
Yes, you are <i> el campeon!</i>
<i>Yeah, you are el campeon!</i>

44:09.981 --> 44:11.080
Oh, shit!

44:11.082 --> 44:12.749
Bring it in right here!

44:12.751 --> 44:14.884
Yeah,
I shouldn't have
had a drink.

44:14.886 --> 44:17.320
I shouldn't have
had a drink.

44:17.322 --> 44:19.122
Meet me
in the parking lot!

44:19.124 --> 44:21.924
Yeah. You got it, man.

44:24.962 --> 44:26.896
Hey, Dad.
Hey.

44:26.898 --> 44:28.431
Whoa!

44:28.433 --> 44:30.133
What is that?

44:30.135 --> 44:32.301
That is your mom's
anniversary gift.

44:32.303 --> 44:35.138
Another reminder that I
got life by the balls.

44:35.140 --> 44:36.973
Check it out.

44:36.975 --> 44:38.374
Is that one
of those rotisserie grills?

44:38.376 --> 44:41.811

She is gonna love it.

You know why?
Women love kitchen stuff.

to deny it in this PC day

at home and stuff.

go to stylists.

even matter

been avoiding me?

55:37.635 --> 55:39.501
(SCREAMING)

55:42.806 --> 55:44.540
Bye-bye, scalp.

55:44.542 --> 55:46.508
Does it have
to do with bumping?

55:46.510 --> 55:47.843
No bumping!

55:47.845 --> 55:52.681
Bumping is a one-way ticket
to injury land USA.

55:52.683 --> 55:55.651
And if the karts
don't injure you, I will.

55:55.653 --> 55:58.687
I will come out there
and punch you in the face

55:58.689 --> 56:00.656
so you don't injure
any of our other drivers.

56:00.658 --> 56:02.758
That's how much I care
about the rest of you.

56:02.760 --> 56:04.993
Wait, wait, wait.
Let me get this straight.

56:04.995 --> 56:07.062
We should or we
shouldn't bump?

56:07.064 --> 56:08.931
Looks like we got
ourselves a comedian.

56:08.933 --> 56:11.767
Let me ask you this,
Mr. Comedian.
Is this hilarious?

56:13.470 --> 56:14.870
It's kind of funny.

56:14.872 --> 56:20.943
Go-kart accident!
Stuttgart, Germany! 2007.

56:20.945 --> 56:22.378
It doesn't even
look like a real leg.

56:22.380 --> 56:24.446
It's not real.

56:24.448 --> 56:26.715
It's a mock-up that
I made because no one
took photos that day.

56:26.717 --> 56:28.083
Makes sense.

56:28.085 --> 56:29.952
Bump once,
I kick you the F out.

56:29.954 --> 56:32.955
You bump twice,
what happens?

56:32.957 --> 56:35.124
Trick question.
You can't bump twice,

56:35.126 --> 56:37.760
because if you bump once,
I've already
kicked your ass out.

56:37.762 --> 56:40.929
And you're at home
sitting on your couch alone,

56:40.931 --> 56:45.033
watching the Food Network,
wishing you hadn't bumped.

56:47.737 --> 56:50.172
(CHEERS)

56:50.174 --> 56:52.007
Hey!
Keep your hands
on the wheel!

56:52.009 --> 56:53.542
(SCREAMS)

56:53.544 --> 56:55.577
Put your legs
back in the kart!

56:55.579 --> 56:56.979
It's your last warning!

56:56.981 --> 56:58.614
Get over here!

56:58.616 --> 57:00.682
Why, hello, old friend!

57:00.684 --> 57:02.518
Would you like to partake
in some light
bumping this afternoon?

57:02.520 --> 57:04.420
I would say
that we should
definitely do that.

57:04.422 --> 57:05.854
Okay, then we should bump!

57:08.091 --> 57:09.625
I'm gonna bump
the shit out of you!

57:09.627 --> 57:11.427
You're dead, bro!

57:11.429 --> 57:12.428
MATTY: Shit!

57:13.663 --> 57:15.664
No bumping! No bumping!

57:15.666 --> 57:18.700
(LAUGHING)

57:18.702 --> 57:21.203
I remember you motherfuckers!
You used to bump
more than anyone!

57:21.205 --> 57:22.704
I told you never
to come back here.
You're dead!

57:24.474 --> 57:25.474
MATTY: Fuck!

57:40.957 --> 57:42.624
(PANTING)

57:45.695 --> 57:46.862
Why didn't we
just run to our cars?

57:46.864 --> 57:48.497
I don't know.
I just panicked.

57:48.499 --> 57:50.032
Yeah, me, too.

57:50.034 --> 57:51.867
He was fucking pissed!
Yeah.

57:51.869 --> 57:53.001
He was more
pissed than I've ever
seen him before,

57:53.003 --> 57:55.003
and that's saying a lot.

57:55.005 --> 57:56.004
I don't think
we can go back there
for 10 years.

57:56.006 --> 57:57.072
No way. (CHUCKLES)

58:00.844 --> 58:03.745
Dude, I'm sorry about
saying all that stuff,

58:03.747 --> 58:07.783
wishing you were
straight and all that.

58:07.785 --> 58:11.220
Oh. It's okay, man.
I'm sorry that I said
your brownie was shitty.

58:11.222 --> 58:14.056
Oh, I know it's not.
It's amazing.

58:14.058 --> 58:16.124
Yeah.

58:16.126 --> 58:18.794
It's actually still in
the freezer by the way.

58:18.796 --> 58:21.163
You think this
Greg guy is the one?
He could be your brownie guy.

58:21.165 --> 58:22.598
Man, I don't know.

58:22.600 --> 58:23.866
Have you
touched his balls yet?

58:23.868 --> 58:25.200
Oh, come on.

58:25.202 --> 58:27.970
What? You like balls.
You're a ball guy.

58:27.972 --> 58:29.538
I never said that.
You said that.

58:29.540 --> 58:31.039
I think you made
that up actually.

58:31.041 --> 58:33.509
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I did do that.

58:33.511 --> 58:36.044
What about you, man?
What have you
got going on?

58:36.046 --> 58:38.580
Me?

58:38.582 --> 58:40.816
I actually got someone
I'm thinking about.

58:40.818 --> 58:41.917
Nice!

58:44.754 --> 58:45.888
You're over Em, right?

58:47.524 --> 58:48.657
Dude.
What?

58:48.659 --> 58:49.958
Seriously?

58:49.960 --> 58:52.060
What, dude?
You're seriously
gonna do this?

58:52.062 --> 58:54.663
You're gonna call dibs
on her even after you've
broken up with her,

58:54.665 --> 58:56.732
and you're not into persons
with her sexual organs?

58:56.734 --> 58:59.668
No, I'm not calling dibs.

58:59.670 --> 59:02.204
I feel like it's weird.
Tell me it's not weird.

59:02.206 --> 59:04.907
It's not weird.
It's not weird.

59:04.909 --> 59:07.042
I think it's
a little weird.
All right.

59:07.044 --> 59:09.077
I'm gonna go.
I'm supposed to meet up
with Greg in a little bit.

59:09.079 --> 59:10.913
But this was super-fun.

59:10.915 --> 59:12.314
Good to see you, man.
Great to see you, man.

59:12.316 --> 59:14.917
What if I call
dibs on Greg?

59:14.919 --> 59:16.785
Mmm.
That makes no sense.

59:16.787 --> 59:18.020
No. I'll see you
later, brother.

59:18.022 --> 59:19.154
All right.

59:22.559 --> 59:24.826
Actually, I'm parked
over there, too.

59:33.937 --> 59:35.103
Yeah, that's happening.

59:35.105 --> 59:36.972
MICHAEL: So she's
not an angel.

59:38.575 --> 59:39.775
Okay, let's go.

59:39.777 --> 59:42.578
Yep.

59:42.580 --> 59:48.350
Thanks for hanging out
with me and dealing
with my shit recently.

59:48.352 --> 59:49.918
It's been fun.

59:49.920 --> 59:52.220
Yeah,
it's been fun
for me, too.

59:53.923 --> 59:57.759
Why is this the only spot
that people drive up to?

59:57.761 --> 59:59.361
Because it's Glen Ellen.

59:59.363 --> 01:00:02.331
This abandoned
construction lot

01:00:02.333 --> 01:00:04.299
is the most romantic
place in town.

01:00:06.002 --> 01:00:09.204
So you brought us here
because it's romantic?

01:00:09.206 --> 01:00:12.107
Oh, yes, I did. I did.

01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:16.612
Those beautiful porta-potties,
and the broken glass,

01:00:16.614 --> 01:00:20.148
and used condoms
really just get me
right in the mood.

01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:21.149
(CHUCKLES) That's good.

01:00:26.389 --> 01:00:28.924
Wait, Michael,
I need to tell you
something.

01:00:28.926 --> 01:00:30.225
What?

01:00:32.195 --> 01:00:35.697
After Matty and I broke up,
we hooked up one more time.

01:00:38.701 --> 01:00:39.768
When?

01:00:41.671 --> 01:00:44.239
After you guys
went to that club.

01:00:50.913 --> 01:00:52.948
And we...

01:00:56.285 --> 01:00:57.386
We had sex.

01:00:58.955 --> 01:01:00.255
What?

01:01:00.257 --> 01:01:01.657
Yeah.

01:01:01.659 --> 01:01:03.659
You what? (STUTTERS)

01:01:03.661 --> 01:01:05.761
Yeah, I know.

01:01:05.763 --> 01:01:09.831
I was drunk,
and we both had
really weird nights.

01:01:09.833 --> 01:01:11.400
How can that happen?
It just did.

01:01:11.402 --> 01:01:14.403
He's gay. He's gay.

01:01:14.405 --> 01:01:16.338
Well, you're not
the only one in the world

01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:17.806
with confused feelings,
Michael.

01:01:17.808 --> 01:01:19.775
I'm not confused.

01:01:19.777 --> 01:01:21.843
I definitely wouldn't
have sex with a gay guy.

01:01:21.845 --> 01:01:23.412
Okay, now,
you're just
being an asshole.

01:01:23.414 --> 01:01:25.313
You're an asshole.

01:01:27.917 --> 01:01:29.151
(SIGHS) I can't do this.

01:01:29.153 --> 01:01:30.152
Michael...

01:01:31.421 --> 01:01:32.721
Michael!

01:02:12.495 --> 01:02:14.329
(GRUNTING)

01:02:22.038 --> 01:02:23.238
Shit.

01:02:58.074 --> 01:02:59.808
(DOOR BELL RINGS)

01:03:02.812 --> 01:03:04.946
Oh, hey, Michael.
Oh, is Matty home?

01:03:04.948 --> 01:03:07.115
Yeah, he sure is.
We're just getting ready
to sit down to dinner.

01:03:07.117 --> 01:03:09.317
You want to join us?

01:03:09.319 --> 01:03:10.886
Yes, I would.
Okay, great.

01:03:10.888 --> 01:03:12.854
Well, come on in.
What have you got there?

01:03:12.856 --> 01:03:14.856
This is a private thing.

01:03:17.226 --> 01:03:19.394
Oh. Mmm.

01:03:24.367 --> 01:03:26.802
LARS: Mom, this
chicken is incredible.

01:03:26.804 --> 01:03:28.136
This skin is so...

01:03:28.138 --> 01:03:29.571
Crispy?
Crispy!

01:03:29.573 --> 01:03:31.973
You're damn right it is.
(CHUCKLES)

01:03:31.975 --> 01:03:36.044
That is the Ronco
Showtime Rotisserie
doing its thing.

01:03:36.046 --> 01:03:37.245
It's just fucking great.

01:03:37.247 --> 01:03:39.047
Lars. Language, please.

01:03:39.049 --> 01:03:41.049
Oh. This is a great meal.
(CHUCKLES)

01:03:41.051 --> 01:03:42.551
DWAYNE: And all because
of a great gift.

01:03:42.553 --> 01:03:43.552
(MOUTHING) Are you okay?

01:03:43.554 --> 01:03:45.353
(MOUTHING) I hate you.

01:03:45.355 --> 01:03:46.955
Why don't we thank your mother
by going around the table

01:03:46.957 --> 01:03:49.891
and saying
what our favorite
part of the meal is?

01:03:49.893 --> 01:03:51.526
I'll go first.

01:03:51.528 --> 01:03:53.428
The chicken.

01:03:53.430 --> 01:03:56.498
But more specifically,
the skin.

01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:58.300
How did I know you
were going to say that?

01:03:58.302 --> 01:04:00.268
Lars?
Skin.

01:04:00.270 --> 01:04:01.536
Matty?

01:04:01.538 --> 01:04:03.438
Yeah, skin.

01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:05.340
Pat?

01:04:05.342 --> 01:04:06.441
(LAUGHS)

01:04:06.443 --> 01:04:08.276
Michael?

01:04:08.278 --> 01:04:11.880
My favorite part of this meal
is how Matty fucked a girl!

01:04:11.882 --> 01:04:13.114
(LAUGHS)

01:04:13.116 --> 01:04:14.516
Michael, language.

01:04:14.518 --> 01:04:18.253
Well, that's not really
the answer to the question.

01:04:18.255 --> 01:04:19.554
I am kind of curious.
Is that true, Matty?

01:04:22.425 --> 01:04:24.392
I'm sorry.
Can I please be excused

01:04:24.394 --> 01:04:25.560
to speak with Michael
in the other room?

01:04:25.562 --> 01:04:28.997
Well, we are
having a family dinner.

01:04:28.999 --> 01:04:29.998
Why don't you let
them talk it out?

01:04:34.871 --> 01:04:36.605
(WHISPERS) Dwayne. Dwayne.

01:04:36.607 --> 01:04:37.639
Ask him.

01:04:40.042 --> 01:04:41.576
Dude, what the fuck?

01:04:41.578 --> 01:04:43.144
You had sex with Em.

01:04:43.146 --> 01:04:44.446
So what?

01:04:44.448 --> 01:04:46.047
So I like her a lot.

01:04:46.049 --> 01:04:47.249
She was my girlfriend.
You're gay.

01:04:47.251 --> 01:04:49.184
Shh! Shut up!

01:04:49.186 --> 01:04:52.287
You don't deserve her.
You don't deserve any girl.

01:04:52.289 --> 01:04:54.322
Why did you do that?

01:04:54.324 --> 01:04:57.058
Why are you even
at my house? What the fuck
are you doing here?

01:04:58.094 --> 01:04:59.527
You're gay.

01:04:59.529 --> 01:05:00.629
I need you to shut up
for the rest of dinner.

01:05:00.631 --> 01:05:04.032
Can you please
just do that for me?

01:05:04.034 --> 01:05:07.335
LARS: What?
You don't like that movie?
I don't believe it.

01:05:07.337 --> 01:05:09.037
DWAYNE: When you're married,
I'll let you know what that...

01:05:09.039 --> 01:05:10.639
Hi, Matty.
Welcome back.

01:05:10.641 --> 01:05:12.340
DWAYNE: Okay, boys.

01:05:12.342 --> 01:05:15.410
Family meal.
Anything going
on with you two?

01:05:15.412 --> 01:05:17.312
Yeah, a lot, actually.

01:05:17.314 --> 01:05:19.247
Today was
a crazy day at PacSun.

01:05:19.249 --> 01:05:20.515
We got these huge
new shipments in.

01:05:20.517 --> 01:05:23.151
I had tons and tons
of board shorts.

01:05:23.153 --> 01:05:25.520
So I took a look
at the different styles,
and I said to Laurie,

01:05:25.522 --> 01:05:30.258
I said, "Laurie, I will
sell all of these lace-up
board shorts today.

01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:32.460
"Not this week, today."

01:05:32.462 --> 01:05:34.629
And she was like,
"Yeah, right, Lars! No way."

01:05:34.631 --> 01:05:36.631
And by the end of the day,
get this, Dad.
(MOUTHING) What are you doing?

01:05:36.633 --> 01:05:38.633
(MOUTHING) I hate you.
(MOUTHING) Stop!

01:05:38.635 --> 01:05:40.468
LARS: I sold all
of the lace-ups and some
of the non-lace-ups.

01:05:40.470 --> 01:05:43.138
So I was like,
"Suck it, Laurie!"
(LAUGHS)

01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:44.406
PATRICIA: That's fantastic.
DWAYNE: Great work, son.

01:05:44.408 --> 01:05:46.341
Very ambitious,
just like your dad.

01:05:46.343 --> 01:05:50.979
LARS: I got something
else that I really want to
share with you guys.

01:05:50.981 --> 01:05:54.482
First off, I wanna thank you
for keeping me so
humble on this journey.

01:05:54.484 --> 01:05:55.717
I know it's been tough,
but something

01:05:55.719 --> 01:05:57.185
really great
happened to me today.

01:05:57.187 --> 01:05:58.386
(MOUTHING) You're gay.

01:05:58.388 --> 01:06:00.255
(MOUTHING) You are an asshole.

01:06:00.257 --> 01:06:03.325
I just found out my band,
we're playing the prom!

01:06:03.327 --> 01:06:05.226
Matty's gay!

01:06:05.228 --> 01:06:08.129
That's great!
Congratulations!

01:06:08.131 --> 01:06:09.597
Daddy.
Wait.

01:06:09.599 --> 01:06:11.366
What did you say?
Nothing.

01:06:11.368 --> 01:06:13.368
Matty's gay.
Shut the fuck up, Michael.

01:06:13.370 --> 01:06:14.736
Language.
What is he talking about?

01:06:14.738 --> 01:06:16.471
Matty's a gay guy.
You have a gay son.

01:06:16.473 --> 01:06:18.340
Language.
Gay is not a bad word.

01:06:18.342 --> 01:06:20.342
It's debatable.

01:06:20.344 --> 01:06:22.711
All right, everyone
just cut the bullshit!
What is going on?

01:06:22.713 --> 01:06:25.981
It's a milestone
in my musical career, Dad,
is what's going on!

01:06:25.983 --> 01:06:27.282
Matthew...

01:06:27.284 --> 01:06:28.316
Matty, is this true?

01:06:28.318 --> 01:06:30.085
No!

01:06:30.087 --> 01:06:31.987
Matthew, answer your mother.
I said no!

01:06:31.989 --> 01:06:33.722
He's not gay.

01:06:33.724 --> 01:06:35.256
DWAYNE: No.

01:06:35.258 --> 01:06:36.758
All right, why don't
you excuse yourself

01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:38.293
to your room, and
I will meet you there.

01:06:38.295 --> 01:06:39.427
Michael, this
dinner is over right now.

01:06:39.429 --> 01:06:40.695
Fine.

01:06:40.697 --> 01:06:43.298
Seriously?
DWAYNE: You heard me.

01:06:55.044 --> 01:06:56.745
It's gonna be awesome.

01:06:56.747 --> 01:06:59.614
I know it's a prom,
but I think
I can get you two in.

01:07:16.232 --> 01:07:17.332
(GROANS)

01:07:33.582 --> 01:07:34.582
Did you out Matty
to his parents?

01:07:35.584 --> 01:07:36.785
Hold on.

01:07:36.787 --> 01:07:38.486
Did you tell
them that he's gay?

01:07:38.488 --> 01:07:40.288
It's complicated.

01:07:40.290 --> 01:07:42.157
Did you think for a second
about what that meant to him?

01:07:42.159 --> 01:07:43.658
Let me explain!

01:07:43.660 --> 01:07:44.659
Do you have any idea
what's happening
to him right now?

01:07:44.661 --> 01:07:46.061
Wait!

01:07:46.063 --> 01:07:47.362
He was your best
friend, Michael!

01:07:47.364 --> 01:07:50.298
Your best friend!

01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:52.333

01:09:04.573 --> 01:09:06.307
This looks good, right?

01:09:06.309 --> 01:09:08.609
It is perfect.

not my business,

but I thought you
really liked that guy.

01:09:25.328 --> 01:09:27.228
Yeah,
I just can't do
that anymore.

Him specifically or...

01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:34.469
Just all of it.

01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:36.571
Matthew, we found
the most darling cufflinks.

01:09:36.573 --> 01:09:37.705
They're little pigs.

01:09:37.707 --> 01:09:39.841
Why would I
want those, Mom?

01:09:39.843 --> 01:09:42.710
I'm sorry.
I gave you the wrong jacket.
Let me get you the right one.

01:09:42.712 --> 01:09:45.813
Oh. Get this off.
It's two sizes too small.
Silly. (CHUCKLES)

01:09:47.716 --> 01:09:49.684
There we go.

01:09:49.685 --> 01:09:51.486
Uh-oh.

01:09:51.488 --> 01:09:52.787
Yes, yes, yes.

01:09:53.856 --> 01:09:55.957
Now you look
good enough to eat.

01:09:55.959 --> 01:09:57.859
Mmm. (CHUCKLES)

01:09:57.861 --> 01:10:01.796
Yes. Very handsome.

01:10:01.798 --> 01:10:06.734
Oh. Matthew, this reminds
me of your dad when
we went to our prom.

01:10:06.736 --> 01:10:09.671
You went to the prom
with your husband, and
you're still together?

01:10:09.673 --> 01:10:11.773
We sure are. 32 years.

01:10:11.775 --> 01:10:14.375
Congratulations!

01:10:14.377 --> 01:10:17.612
I wish I could say the
same, but old Linda
is still playing the field.

01:10:17.614 --> 01:10:21.282
Oh. That's okay. It's fun
being single. Live it up!

01:10:21.284 --> 01:10:25.620
Oh. Thirty-two years.
Wow. Maybe you can
give me some advice.

01:10:25.622 --> 01:10:29.557
I'm dating a Colombian man.
We have very little in common.

01:10:29.559 --> 01:10:34.462
We hardly understand
each other, but the sex
is really amazing.

01:10:34.464 --> 01:10:37.365
He's only willing
to see me on Tuesdays.
Now, what is that about?

01:10:37.367 --> 01:10:39.234
Might be a cultural thing.

01:10:39.236 --> 01:10:41.736
Then there's Gene.
Gene's very bright.

01:10:41.738 --> 01:10:44.339
He's got a skin condition,
but that's not
a deal-breaker for me.

01:10:44.341 --> 01:10:48.443
And the sex is ridiculous!
Oh. What do I do?

01:10:48.445 --> 01:10:50.845
High school prom,
we're getting fitted for.

01:10:50.847 --> 01:10:53.314
Then there's Claude.

01:10:53.316 --> 01:10:57.018
He's 5'6'',
he owns a sailboat,
and he's my mailman.

01:10:57.020 --> 01:10:59.287
The sex is amazing!

01:10:59.289 --> 01:11:00.955
But only on the sailboat.

01:11:02.424 --> 01:11:04.859
When it's rocky.

01:11:04.861 --> 01:11:07.595
But I think that's because
Claude is a little lazy.

01:11:07.597 --> 01:11:09.831
What do I do?

01:11:09.833 --> 01:11:12.333
I'm not even really sure
what we're talking
about at this point.

01:11:12.335 --> 01:11:16.804
You're not kidding.
Relationships are hard.
They are complicated.

01:11:16.806 --> 01:11:19.307
Although, you two kids
seem to have it
figured out, right?

01:11:19.309 --> 01:11:20.775
You look so
cute together.

01:11:20.777 --> 01:11:22.610

all figured out.

But she's right.

01:11:36.359 --> 01:11:40.328
You two kids make
the most adorable couple.

01:11:40.330 --> 01:11:43.031
Matthew, look at you!

01:11:43.033 --> 01:11:46.834
You're going to the prom
with the most beautiful girl.

01:11:46.836 --> 01:11:51.639
Yes. Beautiful girl,
prom. We're doing it.

01:11:52.641 --> 01:11:53.875
Yay.

to the bathroom.

Matthew, is anything
the matter?

01:12:06.389 --> 01:12:07.722
No.

01:12:07.724 --> 01:12:09.957
Okay.

01:12:09.959 --> 01:12:13.661
Well, you know that
you can always come
to me to talk, right?

01:12:13.663 --> 01:12:15.430
About anything,
anything at all.

01:12:15.432 --> 01:12:16.764
Yeah.

01:12:16.766 --> 01:12:18.399
You tell me. Okay?

01:12:18.401 --> 01:12:20.001

I don't want to tell you
how to live your life,

01:12:34.818 --> 01:12:37.719
but it's 4:00 p.m.

01:12:37.721 --> 01:12:40.488
You haven't left the house,
except to go to school,
for days.

01:12:43.459 --> 01:12:45.960
Okay.

taking no for
an answer, mister.

and you talk to me now.

stay the same?

Do you remember
when your mom
and I split up?

01:13:16.558 --> 01:13:17.825
Yeah.

01:13:17.827 --> 01:13:18.993
What happened?

01:13:21.630 --> 01:13:24.699
You cried and built
a lot of birdhouses.

01:13:25.968 --> 01:13:29.036
And then what happened?

01:13:29.038 --> 01:13:31.038
You took me to Disney
World for two weeks,

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:33.174
and even I thought
it was too long.

01:13:34.977 --> 01:13:36.544
And then what happened?

01:13:38.781 --> 01:13:42.016
You became friends
with Mom again.

01:13:42.018 --> 01:13:44.652
And why do you
think we did that?

01:13:44.654 --> 01:13:47.555
For me?
No.

01:13:47.557 --> 01:13:49.690
We did it
because we loved
each other very much,

01:13:49.692 --> 01:13:50.958
and that's a rare thing.

01:13:58.867 --> 01:14:01.068

thing, Michael.

What are you doing here?

01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:33.701
I just needed a drink,
and I knew this place
would let me in.

01:14:33.703 --> 01:14:34.936
I hear that.

01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:39.740

with you and Matty?

my calls as of late.

It's not easy to come
out of the closet and
then stay there.

When I came out
in high school,

01:15:02.031 --> 01:15:04.098
my best friend,
he basically disowned me.

01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:06.167
And he was
a water polo player.

01:15:06.169 --> 01:15:09.804
It's the faggiest sport
there is. Those guys
wax their assholes.

01:15:09.806 --> 01:15:13.808
When I came out,
my best friend stopped
sharing sodas with me,

01:15:13.810 --> 01:15:17.144
stopped giving me
rides to school,
de-friended me on Facebook,

01:15:17.146 --> 01:15:19.614
and then moved to Germany.

01:15:19.616 --> 01:15:24.085
The moving part was unrelated
to me coming out, he claims.

01:15:24.087 --> 01:15:28.956
I don't want to be
one of those guys.
I've been just a huge jerk.

Have you talked
to Matty about it?

01:15:30.527 --> 01:15:32.026
I've tried to.
He won't talk to me.

01:15:32.028 --> 01:15:33.661
Maybe you need to try
a little bit harder.

01:15:33.663 --> 01:15:35.796
Maybe you need to find out
where he's gonna be,

01:15:35.798 --> 01:15:39.267
you need to corner him,
and make him hear
what you have to say.

01:18:14.190 --> 01:18:16.357
Get the fuck off the stage.
Yeah.

01:18:16.359 --> 01:18:19.927
Hey, potty mouth.
You get off the stage,
or I'm cutting the power off.

01:18:19.929 --> 01:18:20.961
Shit, it's the principal.

01:18:20.963 --> 01:18:22.263
Go.

01:18:22.265 --> 01:18:23.964

01:18:25.801 --> 01:18:27.802
Don't kill our momentum, bro.

01:18:29.304 --> 01:18:30.438
Thanks.

01:18:44.287 --> 01:18:48.956
<i>I just wanted to sing a song,</i>

01:18:48.958 --> 01:18:51.058
<i>if you don't mind.</i>

01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:53.994
<i>The song is about</i>

01:18:53.996 --> 01:18:56.397
<i>which I am not very good at.</i>

01:18:57.399 --> 01:18:58.466
<i>Um...</i>

01:19:01.069 --> 01:19:04.371
<i>I've done a lot</i>

<i>the last couple of months,</i>

01:19:07.476 --> 01:19:11.378
<i>and, uh, I think</i>
<i>I'm learning</i>

01:19:13.882 --> 01:19:15.216

01:20:22.285 --> 01:20:24.018

01:20:26.388 --> 01:20:28.389
<i>Okay. Good, actually.</i>

01:20:28.391 --> 01:20:30.357
<i>Because that ties</i>

01:20:30.359 --> 01:20:32.927
<i>I wanted to mention</i>
<i>while I'm up here,</i>

01:20:32.929 --> 01:20:36.330
<i>that even though I'm not gay,</i>
<i>I'm a straight man,</i>

01:20:36.332 --> 01:20:42.069
<i>I brought a guy</i>
<i>to prom tonight,</i>
<i>a really cool guy.</i>

01:20:42.071 --> 01:20:43.504
<i>I did that because</i>

01:20:46.141 --> 01:20:50.010
<i>it shouldn't matter</i>
<i>who you bring to prom.</i>

01:20:50.012 --> 01:20:52.446

<i>attracted to in life</i>

01:20:52.448 --> 01:20:54.348
<i>or who you fall in love with.</i>

01:20:54.350 --> 01:20:57.852
<i>Just bring whoever</i>
<i>you want to prom.</i>

01:20:57.854 --> 01:20:59.987
<i>And as for the gay thing,</i>

01:20:59.989 --> 01:21:04.124
<i>gay people are just people</i>
<i>who have sex</i>
<i>a little bit differently.</i>

01:21:06.061 --> 01:21:08.462
<i>And I'm sure that it</i>
<i>still feels amazing.</i>

01:21:10.498 --> 01:21:13.467
<i>So, yeah, call me gay.</i>
<i>I don't care. Doesn't</i>
<i>bother me one bit.</i>

01:21:13.469 --> 01:21:16.237
BOY: Gay!

01:21:16.239 --> 01:21:20.374
<i>Okay. Well, I got through</i>
<i>to you then, I guess.</i>

01:21:20.376 --> 01:21:25.012
<i>So thank you</i>
<i>guys for listening.</i>
<i>Enjoy your prom.</i>

01:21:39.227 --> 01:21:42.596
That took big,
King Kong-sized
donkey balls.

01:21:42.598 --> 01:21:45.232
Thanks. Thank you.

01:21:45.234 --> 01:21:47.301
Hey, man,
are you sure
you're not gay?

01:21:47.303 --> 01:21:50.037
Yeah, pretty sure.

01:21:50.039 --> 01:21:52.139
Because a lot
of people are going to think
you're gay after tonight.

01:21:52.141 --> 01:21:55.075
I know.
It's okay.

01:21:55.077 --> 01:21:59.179
Aw, man, I let her
out of my sight
for one second.

01:21:59.181 --> 01:22:02.483
Check it out. Here comes Ava.
She's gonna be so pissed!

01:22:02.485 --> 01:22:04.184
DAN: Oh.
MICHAEL: Wow.

01:22:08.223 --> 01:22:10.557
Oh!
Ah!

01:22:10.559 --> 01:22:12.126
GREG: That girl is a freak.

01:22:12.128 --> 01:22:13.694
I need some air.

01:22:16.564 --> 01:22:17.631
Hey.

01:22:19.401 --> 01:22:20.634
Hey.

01:22:20.636 --> 01:22:21.635
MATTY: Hey.

01:22:24.039 --> 01:22:25.039
Hey.

01:22:27.342 --> 01:22:29.043
I liked what
you said up there.

01:22:31.079 --> 01:22:34.648
It's not enough.
It doesn't make
up for everything.

01:22:34.650 --> 01:22:36.550
It's a start.

01:22:36.552 --> 01:22:40.487
I know I was
super-weird
in there earlier.

01:22:40.489 --> 01:22:44.258
But I'm really glad
to see you here.

01:22:44.260 --> 01:22:46.193
It's good
to see you, too.

01:22:46.195 --> 01:22:50.164
Even if it is at a prom,
because they are terrible.

01:22:50.166 --> 01:22:53.334
A prom is like one gigantic,
shitty wedding between
500 idiotic teenagers.

01:22:53.336 --> 01:22:55.135
Yeah, it's bad.

01:22:55.137 --> 01:22:58.405
That first day
when we were talking
about Matty coming out,

01:22:58.407 --> 01:23:01.308
I should have
gotten him that cake
that said "you're gay."

01:23:01.310 --> 01:23:03.444
It would have been
better than all
the stupid stuff I did.

01:23:03.446 --> 01:23:05.012
There's still time.

01:23:05.014 --> 01:23:06.981
There's a bakery
right around the corner

01:23:06.983 --> 01:23:09.083
that specializes in
gay apology cakes.

01:23:09.085 --> 01:23:13.320
Really?
Where is it?
Just kidding.

01:23:13.322 --> 01:23:17.057
I know you're
fucking with me this time.
Always fucking with me.

01:23:17.059 --> 01:23:18.425
And I'm sorry that I
stopped calling you.

01:23:18.427 --> 01:23:20.094
I'm really sorry
for freaking out on you.

01:23:20.096 --> 01:23:21.762
Don't be sorry.

01:23:21.764 --> 01:23:25.566
And if there's anything
that I can do to help,
you let me know.

01:23:25.568 --> 01:23:27.601
You're doing it right now.

01:23:27.603 --> 01:23:29.269
Do you think you and I
could ever hang out again?

01:23:29.271 --> 01:23:30.371
Yeah, I'd like that.

01:23:37.212 --> 01:23:40.681
Actually, I have to go
do one more thing tonight.

01:23:40.683 --> 01:23:43.083
There's something I need
to do before this whole
thing gets wrapped up.

01:23:43.085 --> 01:23:44.218
Good luck.

01:23:44.220 --> 01:23:45.219
Go.

01:24:00.568 --> 01:24:01.769
(CHUCKLES)

01:24:39.140 --> 01:24:41.475
Yo. Are you
leaving already?

01:24:41.477 --> 01:24:45.846
No, I was just gonna
grab this and then find you.

01:24:45.848 --> 01:24:48.248
(CHUCKLES) You brought
the brownie to prom?

01:24:48.250 --> 01:24:50.818
I bring it everywhere.
It's like my baby.

01:24:50.820 --> 01:24:53.687
I'm sorry about
all the stuff I did.

01:24:53.689 --> 01:24:55.422
I actually brought
this here tonight

01:24:55.424 --> 01:24:57.724
because I want you and I
to get rid of this together.

01:24:57.726 --> 01:25:00.160
This brownie
represents the old me

01:25:00.162 --> 01:25:02.496
who was just afraid
things wouldn't
stay the same,

01:25:02.498 --> 01:25:04.231
and that we wouldn't
be the same kind of
friends anymore.

01:25:04.233 --> 01:25:06.366
I know it's stupid,
but that's how it felt.

01:25:06.368 --> 01:25:08.469
So, you and I need
to destroy this
thing tonight.

01:25:08.471 --> 01:25:09.636
Fuck, no!

01:25:09.638 --> 01:25:11.205
What?

01:25:11.207 --> 01:25:13.307
This brownie is
fucking beautiful.

01:25:13.309 --> 01:25:16.777
And what you said
tonight on stage, dude,
that was so awesome.

01:25:16.779 --> 01:25:18.512
(CHUCKLES)

01:25:18.514 --> 01:25:20.747
I think I'm going
to come out
to my parents.

01:25:20.749 --> 01:25:22.716
Really?
Yeah.

01:25:22.718 --> 01:25:25.119
I mean, I think it's
gonna be all right.

01:25:25.121 --> 01:25:26.720
That is great, man.

01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:30.724
So, are we gonna eat
this thing or what?

01:25:30.726 --> 01:25:32.726
Right now?

01:25:32.728 --> 01:25:35.829
Yeah, it's amazing.
Look at the artistry
on all these dicks.

01:25:35.831 --> 01:25:38.432
You frosted veins
on this one's shaft.

01:25:38.434 --> 01:25:40.734
Well, I used a pastry bag
with a special nozzle.

01:25:40.736 --> 01:25:44.138
And this one over here,
the pubes are gorgeous.

01:25:44.140 --> 01:25:45.139
I want to put
the pubes in my mouth.

01:25:45.141 --> 01:25:46.406
You love pubes?

01:25:46.408 --> 01:25:47.407
You're goddamn right,
I love pubes!

01:25:47.409 --> 01:25:49.143
Cool.

01:25:49.145 --> 01:25:51.812
I love this brownie,
and I love you.

01:25:51.814 --> 01:25:53.814
In a totally non-gay way.

01:25:53.816 --> 01:25:55.516
I love you, too, non-gay.

01:25:55.518 --> 01:25:57.484
Let's bring it in.

01:25:59.254 --> 01:26:00.654
Oh, man!
Non-gay!

01:26:00.656 --> 01:26:03.657
Extremely non-gay.
Not interested at all.

01:26:03.659 --> 01:26:04.658
What are you doing?

01:26:04.660 --> 01:26:06.293
I'm picking you up!

01:26:06.295 --> 01:26:07.628
Put me down!

01:26:07.630 --> 01:26:09.897
Don't punch me, man.
I'm sensitive.

01:26:09.899 --> 01:26:10.898
EM: Hey.

01:26:12.834 --> 01:26:16.803
Is this the famous brownie?
How old is this thing?

01:26:16.805 --> 01:26:20.674
Super-old.
But I kept it in the freezer,
so it's cool.

01:26:20.676 --> 01:26:24.311
And I only poured beer on it
a couple of times,
and I cried on it once.

01:26:24.313 --> 01:26:26.613
That's cool.

01:26:26.615 --> 01:26:27.848
Is there enough for four?

01:26:32.654 --> 01:26:34.555
(ALL CHUCKLING)

01:26:37.292 --> 01:26:40.627
Oh, my God,
I'm so high! (LAUGHS)

01:26:40.629 --> 01:26:42.496
What should we do now?

01:26:42.498 --> 01:26:45.232
I mean,
we cannot go back
into prom like this.

01:26:48.736 --> 01:26:51.805
There's only one
place you can go
when you're this high.

01:26:54.642 --> 01:26:55.943
(SCREAMING)

01:26:57.812 --> 01:26:59.246
MICHAEL: I love foam!

01:26:59.248 --> 01:27:01.582
This is the best
night of my life!
