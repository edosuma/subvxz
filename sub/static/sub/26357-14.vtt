(horns honking)

00:07.875 --> 00:10.078
Sorry, little dudes,
we're gonna be here a while.

00:10.111 --> 00:12.513
A truck broke down, and the cops
are taking their sweet time

00:12.546 --> 00:14.148
clearing it up.

00:14.182 --> 00:16.917
(laughing) He thinks
my tummy is a mountain.

00:16.950 --> 00:19.087
Lou, Lou, quick, take a selfie.

00:19.120 --> 00:20.988
It's not a selfie if I take it.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.856
He's kissing me.

00:22.890 --> 00:24.925
Take a selfie! Take a selfie!

00:24.958 --> 00:27.528
Oh, man, my phone's dead.

00:27.561 --> 00:29.430
Milhouse, what am I missing
in the group text?

00:29.463 --> 00:31.065
It's awesome.

You're never gonna get
caught up.

00:35.035 --> 00:38.739
What kind of jazz you
listening to, stupid or boring?

00:38.772 --> 00:40.674
It's Marc Maron's podcast.

00:40.708 --> 00:44.178
He does cool interviews
with really interesting people.

00:44.212 --> 00:46.180
Lame, lame, don't know him.

00:46.214 --> 00:48.182
Lame, lame,

00:48.216 --> 00:50.118
Loudon Wainwright, lame, lame.

00:50.151 --> 00:53.887

This guy interviewed Krusty?

00:53.921 --> 00:59.193
Yeah. Hey, no, aw,
that's my ear bu... Ew.

00:59.227 --> 01:00.561
It's yours now.

01:00.594 --> 01:03.231
MARC MARON:
Wow. That's incredible, Krusty.

01:03.264 --> 01:05.032
I mean, really, I'm blown away.

01:05.065 --> 01:07.968
Yeah, well, it's true.
It's absolutely true.

01:08.001 --> 01:10.871
I have a phobia... of pies.

01:10.904 --> 01:13.941
That's so crazy because,
I mean, we've all seen you get

01:13.974 --> 01:16.043
hit in the face with pies
on your show.

01:16.076 --> 01:19.313
No, no, no, those are cakes
decorated as pies.

01:19.347 --> 01:23.151
Oh, right, so that's how you
make yourself feel safe.

01:23.184 --> 01:26.220
It's not the crust;
it's the fillings.

01:26.254 --> 01:28.055
Krusty, I got to ask you
about something,

01:28.088 --> 01:30.224
and-and I don't want you
to get defensive,

01:30.258 --> 01:32.226
but it's something
you've never talked about.

01:32.260 --> 01:35.396
Can you tell me about
The Sands of Space?

01:35.429 --> 01:38.166
Oh, no.
That's off-limits, soul patch!

01:38.199 --> 01:40.268
We could talk about
the exploding milkshakes

01:40.301 --> 01:41.435
in your Laffy Meals.

01:41.469 --> 01:43.171
Did they ever find
those kids' noses?

01:43.204 --> 01:46.274
Okay, okay, I'll tell you about
The Sands of Space,

01:46.307 --> 01:50.178
the movie that almost
consumed my soul.

01:50.211 --> 01:51.179
(electric can opener whirring)

01:51.212 --> 01:53.113
-(cats mewling)
-Yeah, yeah, keep talking.

01:53.147 --> 01:54.682
I'm just feeding the cats.

01:54.715 --> 01:58.186
(loudly): It all began back in
the golden age of Hollywood,

01:58.219 --> 02:02.490
the late 1980s,
when high concept was king.

02:02.523 --> 02:05.293
You'd mix two kooky words
together in the title,

02:05.326 --> 02:08.128
put a rap song at the end
that explains the plot,

02:08.162 --> 02:12.666
and bam-- you're on the cover
of Premiere magazine.

02:12.700 --> 02:15.603
I had starred in the hit
action buddy comedy

02:15.636 --> 02:17.137
Good Cop, Dog Cop,

02:17.171 --> 02:20.174
where I played
a murdered police officer

02:20.208 --> 02:23.377
who is reincarnated as his
partner's pet Saint Bernard.

02:23.411 --> 02:27.147
Five smashed squad cars,
100 exploded helicopters,

02:27.181 --> 02:29.350
and the mayor's wife has fleas.

02:29.383 --> 02:31.185
Turn in your badge
and your collar.

02:31.219 --> 02:33.321
You're suspended for a month!

02:33.354 --> 02:35.189
For me,
that's like seven months.

02:35.223 --> 02:37.225
Dog Cop!

02:37.258 --> 02:38.992
(grunting)

02:39.026 --> 02:40.994
KRUSTY:
Suddenly, everyone in town

02:41.028 --> 02:43.130
was dying to be
in the Krusty business,

02:43.163 --> 02:46.166
and I was dipping shrimp
with all the big talents

02:46.200 --> 02:49.136
I once longed to see fail.

02:49.169 --> 02:52.573
And, of course, what the studio
wanted most was a sequel.

02:52.606 --> 02:54.342
Okay, Krusty, we've got

02:54.375 --> 02:57.878
Good Cop, Dog Cop 2:
Golden Revolver all lined up.

02:57.911 --> 02:59.713
We, uh... who-who did the...

02:59.747 --> 03:02.316
The two Terrys, they just
turned in a great script.

03:02.350 --> 03:04.818
Savage Sam Borgberg
is all set to direct.

03:04.852 --> 03:06.420
So when do we start?

03:06.454 --> 03:09.056
I get it.
You think I'm just some hack,

03:09.089 --> 03:12.260
out to churn out lazy sequels
for a quick buck.

03:13.294 --> 03:14.495
Yes.

03:14.528 --> 03:17.197
This is my next movie.

03:17.231 --> 03:19.267
The Sands of Space?

03:19.300 --> 03:20.501
Krusty, are you kidding me?

03:20.534 --> 03:23.571
This is the most famously
un-filmable book in history.

03:23.604 --> 03:27.408
It made Kubrick a recluse.
It-it drove Coppola to wine.

03:27.441 --> 03:29.343
The four Jeffs tried
to write a script,

03:29.377 --> 03:31.279
but even they couldn't crack it.

03:31.312 --> 03:34.748
When I bought this at
an adult bookstore by mistake,

03:34.782 --> 03:36.717
it changed my life.

03:36.750 --> 03:39.287
"There's a light that shines
from star to star,

03:39.320 --> 03:43.223
from soul to soul, connecting
everyone in the universe."

03:43.257 --> 03:45.759
Wow.

03:45.793 --> 03:48.562
It's not landing for me
that the hero doesn't

03:48.596 --> 03:52.300
refuse the quest
before he accepts the quest.

03:52.333 --> 03:53.534
Is that landing for you?

03:53.567 --> 03:56.236
Look, I'm not drinking
out of one more toilet

03:56.270 --> 03:58.306
until you green-light
this movie.

03:58.339 --> 04:01.208
And I'm not playing
a dog, either. (grunts)

04:01.241 --> 04:03.577
All right, we got a comic
who wants to make

04:03.611 --> 04:06.246
a hippie-dippie
science-fiction vanity project.

04:06.280 --> 04:10.284
Here's what we do: we humor him,
and we make it dirt cheap.

04:10.318 --> 04:12.152
We could shoot it
in Mexico for nothing.

04:12.185 --> 04:14.221
We hire a has-been to direct it

04:14.254 --> 04:16.324
and never-wases
to do everything else.

04:16.357 --> 04:19.993
After it bombs, that clown will
come scooting his butt back here

04:20.027 --> 04:24.231
to make all the Dog Cop movies
we want. Two more.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.266
KRUSTY:
The Sands of Space was a go,

04:26.300 --> 04:29.069
and the studio hired
the least-qualified crew

04:29.102 --> 04:31.639
they could find,
including a young couple

04:31.672 --> 04:34.308
whose love was just
starting to bloom.

04:34.342 --> 04:36.276
She was full of optimism,

04:36.310 --> 04:39.580
and he was slightly less fat
than he was going to be.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.114
What could be cooler?

04:41.148 --> 04:44.685
You and me working on a movie
together all summer long

04:44.718 --> 04:47.254
as production assistants.

04:47.287 --> 04:49.323
It's so romantic.

04:49.357 --> 04:51.659
We'll be like Elizabeth Taylor

for everybody.

-to direct it: me.
-(all gasp)

06:58.586 --> 07:01.288

have I taken on too much

07:01.321 --> 07:03.591
by starring
and directing a movie

07:03.624 --> 07:06.159
that I was also tricked
into cofinancing?

07:06.193 --> 07:09.663
No, because this story
must be told.

the grips want
their hot dogs boiled,

08:17.665 --> 08:19.366
but the gaffers
want them grilled.

08:19.399 --> 08:22.502
Either way, I don't got no
hot dogs, so, uh, which is it?

-You're hired.

10:07.174 --> 10:08.608
Oh!

10:08.642 --> 10:10.110
(indistinct chatter)

10:10.143 --> 10:12.746
Add more dynamite.

10:12.780 --> 10:15.983
Uh, those explosives are
really close to those extras.

10:16.016 --> 10:17.584
So? We got plenty of them.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.853
That's why they're called
"extras," right?

10:21.154 --> 10:22.723
(Krusty grunting)

10:24.157 --> 10:26.994
You tell that lox
to go to acting school

10:27.027 --> 10:29.997
and work there as a janitor.

10:30.030 --> 10:33.633
Krusty loves what you're doing.
Same energy, little quicker.

10:33.667 --> 10:36.269
Tell him to sod off.

10:36.303 --> 10:38.538
He says, "You got it, baby."

10:38.571 --> 10:41.641
It's so much pressure.
The whole movie depends on it.

10:41.675 --> 10:44.277
Tell the story
that needs to be told.

10:44.311 --> 10:45.813
That butt double
for the action scene,

10:45.846 --> 10:48.716
that butt double for the
love scene. Let's make art!

10:48.749 --> 10:50.650
♪

10:50.684 --> 10:52.052
Sorry I'm late,

10:52.085 --> 10:55.055
but Krusty and I were
storyboarding tomorrow's shots.

10:55.088 --> 10:59.793
Close-up, medium, long, long,
establishing, close,

10:59.827 --> 11:03.964
POV, wide, and then--
get this-- medium.

11:03.997 --> 11:07.467
You've been so busy with
that director, I never see you.

11:07.500 --> 11:10.570
Krusty needs me.
He's under so much pressure.

11:10.603 --> 11:14.074
You wouldn't believe how much
directing dust he's sniffing.

11:14.107 --> 11:15.743
Everyone's working hard.

11:15.776 --> 11:18.712
We had to repaint all the sets
black and white for a flashback.

11:18.746 --> 11:20.380
We wouldn't have been
able to do it

11:20.413 --> 11:22.149
if not for all the crew powder.

11:22.182 --> 11:23.751
Well, it'll all be worth it

11:23.784 --> 11:25.853
when this movie touches
people's hearts,

11:25.886 --> 11:29.723
as Peabo Bryson sings
the theme song over the credits.

11:29.757 --> 11:31.491
You got Peabo?

11:31.524 --> 11:34.694
-Well, he hasn't committed.
-He's not the only one.

11:34.728 --> 11:36.663
This was supposed to be
a romantic adventure,

11:36.696 --> 11:39.666
but whenever we have a moment
alone, your beeper goes off.

11:39.699 --> 11:43.737
Why don't we have
a romantic adventure right now?

11:43.771 --> 11:45.906
-Oh, yeah, baby.
-(moaning)

11:45.939 --> 11:47.841
(pager beeps)

11:47.875 --> 11:50.710
(both moaning)

11:50.744 --> 11:52.112
Wahh-wahh.

11:52.145 --> 11:53.981
(humming a tune)

11:55.916 --> 11:58.786
-Where were you?
-(gasps)

11:58.819 --> 12:02.589
I had to watch the dailies
without you.

12:02.622 --> 12:04.858
Greetings. Welcome.

12:04.892 --> 12:08.695
Greetings. Welcome.
Greetings. Welcome. Greetings.

12:08.728 --> 12:11.698
I've been going back and forth
all night. Which is better?

12:11.731 --> 12:14.768
-Did you get one with "Hello"?
-(screams)

12:16.069 --> 12:19.406
I'm sorry, I was with Homer,
my boyfriend.

12:19.439 --> 12:22.742
Boyfriend? You can't have
a boyfriend. I want you!

12:22.776 --> 12:23.977
Krusty!

12:24.011 --> 12:25.745
Not like a lady.

12:25.779 --> 12:30.117
Like a "mother slash therapist
slash rabbi" who xeroxes things.

12:30.150 --> 12:31.651
Dump the boyfriend.

12:31.684 --> 12:36.656
I believe in this movie, but I
also believe in Homer and Marge.

12:38.291 --> 12:40.660
Me, I'm Marge.

12:40.693 --> 12:44.464
Oh, yes, Marge.
Marge, I knew that.

12:44.497 --> 12:47.634
Marge. Marge.

12:47.667 --> 12:51.138
I'm not going to break up
with Homer. He's my soul mate.

12:51.171 --> 12:54.107
Hmm. You know what? I get it.

12:54.141 --> 12:56.443
Your life has to come first.

12:56.476 --> 12:59.813
Yet again, you're the only one
who can set me straight.

12:59.847 --> 13:02.916
-Thank you.
-(laughs) That's all right.

13:02.950 --> 13:04.651
It's not all right.

13:04.684 --> 13:07.120
I'm gonna grind
that boyfriend down finer

13:07.154 --> 13:09.756
than this movie's red sand...

13:09.789 --> 13:11.959
that I now wish
was sand-colored.

13:11.992 --> 13:14.261
-(intercom buzzes)
-Send in my anesthesiologist

13:14.294 --> 13:16.196
so I can take a nap.

13:16.229 --> 13:18.131
Dreams or no dreams?

13:18.165 --> 13:20.100
Surprise me.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.169
(gas hissing)

13:22.202 --> 13:23.670
(Homer grunts, Marge gasps)

13:23.703 --> 13:24.972
(laughs)

13:29.509 --> 13:30.777
Wow, it's crazy, man, right?

13:30.810 --> 13:32.980
How narcissism and insecurity
go hand in hand?

13:33.013 --> 13:34.781
I mean, you couldn't function

13:34.814 --> 13:36.816
because your assistant
had a boyfriend.

13:36.850 --> 13:38.351
Where does that jealousy
come from?

13:38.385 --> 13:40.053
How would I know?
I fired my shrink

13:40.087 --> 13:43.223
after I found out she was seeing
other patients. Anyway...

13:43.256 --> 13:45.225
KRUSTY:
I made sure the boyfriend

13:45.258 --> 13:48.195
had all the most dangerous jobs
on the set.

13:48.228 --> 13:51.064
I'm out of breakfast burritos.

13:51.098 --> 13:53.867
-(overlapping shouting)
-(Homer screams)

13:55.335 --> 13:57.504
(tires screech)

13:57.537 --> 13:59.539
Bring in the stunt dummy.

14:02.943 --> 14:04.144
(Homer screams)

14:04.177 --> 14:05.545
-(thud)
-(Homer grunts)

14:05.578 --> 14:08.115
Perfect. Let's get
one more for safety.

14:10.417 --> 14:13.820
I'm telling you, your crazy boss
is out to get me.

14:13.853 --> 14:16.990
No, he's not.
Krusty loves our relationship.

14:17.024 --> 14:18.926
Every day,
he says it would be a shame

14:18.959 --> 14:23.063
if something happened to you,
then laughs and laughs.

14:23.096 --> 14:25.899
Then why are they sending me out
to the middle of the desert

14:25.933 --> 14:28.936
to find a lizard for a new scene
about a space lizard?

14:28.969 --> 14:31.504
Hmm, that does sound
a little dangerous.

14:31.538 --> 14:34.407
No, I'm sure it's super safe.

14:34.441 --> 14:36.977
I'll see you
when I get back alive.

14:41.214 --> 14:43.850
(groans)

14:43.883 --> 14:45.185
(wind whistling)

14:45.218 --> 14:47.087
Here, lizard, lizard, lizard.

14:47.120 --> 14:48.888
Who wants to be famous?

14:48.922 --> 14:50.790
Look at all those skeletons.

14:50.823 --> 14:53.626
Mexicans sure love Halloween.

14:53.660 --> 14:54.928
Whoa!

14:54.962 --> 14:57.965
D'oh! (grunts)
What the...? (grunts)

14:59.066 --> 15:01.068
♪

15:03.336 --> 15:05.405
(groans) Wha...

15:05.438 --> 15:07.874
Oh, I'm trapped in a ravine.

15:07.907 --> 15:12.112
Only one thing to do:
wait patiently for death.

15:13.947 --> 15:16.649
-Dad, wake up!
-(mumbles) What?

15:16.683 --> 15:18.285
Yeah, get up, fat-ass.

15:18.318 --> 15:20.487
Who the hell are you,
talking cactuses?

15:20.520 --> 15:22.455
We're the kids
you're never gonna have

15:22.489 --> 15:25.092
if you don't you get your
lazy butt out of that hole.

15:25.125 --> 15:27.995
And technically, it's "cacti."

15:28.028 --> 15:30.430
-Ow!
-(laughs)

15:30.463 --> 15:32.799
Why should I climb out of here
and have you?

15:32.832 --> 15:36.069
Marge spends all her time
taking care of that needy clown.

15:36.103 --> 15:38.571
I thought I was
her passion project.

15:38.605 --> 15:40.940
You know, someday
you might appreciate a wife

15:40.974 --> 15:42.842
who's developed
empathy and patience

15:42.875 --> 15:45.112
for chubby, selfish men.

15:45.145 --> 15:47.647
(laughs)
Look at that bald guy.

15:47.680 --> 15:50.083
(laughs) He's so bald!

15:50.117 --> 15:51.518
I don't think
we'll ever be born.

15:51.551 --> 15:53.520
Sorry, Maggie.

15:53.553 --> 15:55.488
Eat my thorns. (hums)

15:55.522 --> 15:57.024
Why, you prickly...!

15:57.057 --> 15:59.059
-(shouting angrily)
-(choking)

16:04.397 --> 16:06.033
(panting)

16:07.967 --> 16:10.637
A casa. I'm saved.

16:12.872 --> 16:14.641
Ay, caramba!

16:16.243 --> 16:19.979
The Pain Lords forced me to mine
every quarry on this planet,

16:20.013 --> 16:24.417
but they never imagined
I had the Love Gem all along.

16:26.053 --> 16:28.055
And... cut.

16:29.322 --> 16:31.024
That was amazing.

16:31.058 --> 16:32.959
And you remembered
all your lines.

16:32.992 --> 16:35.295
Aw, thanks...

16:35.328 --> 16:37.130
Marge.

16:37.164 --> 16:39.999
You've helped me become
what every director should be:

16:40.033 --> 16:43.070
an amiable guy
who makes everyone suffer

16:43.103 --> 16:44.971
through his hellish process.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.873
Homer's been kidnapped.

16:46.906 --> 16:49.142
-(gasps)
-There's a note.

16:49.176 --> 16:51.978
(speaking Spanish)

16:52.011 --> 16:54.714
"We have taken
your blubbering coward."

16:54.747 --> 16:56.749
(speaking Spanish)

17:01.354 --> 17:03.056
"The ransom is $1 million

17:03.090 --> 17:06.059
or 100 Los Angeles Raiders
season tickets."

17:06.093 --> 17:09.028
-(speaking Spanish)
-"Go, Raiders."

17:09.062 --> 17:11.064
Oh, geez, I'm sorry, everyone.

17:11.098 --> 17:13.533
We don't have the cash
to ransom that kid,

17:13.566 --> 17:15.568
but I think I know
what he'd want:

17:15.602 --> 17:18.105
a special thanks
in the closing credits

17:18.138 --> 17:21.541
right before which kind
of film stock we used.

17:21.574 --> 17:22.875
Back to work.

17:23.976 --> 17:26.179
No. This crew
looks after its own.

17:26.213 --> 17:27.414
We're gonna save Homer,

17:27.447 --> 17:31.251
and I don't care how much
golden time they have to pay us.

17:35.655 --> 17:37.757
We don't have
a million-dollar ransom,

17:37.790 --> 17:39.359
but we do have one thing:

17:39.392 --> 17:41.128
movie magic.

17:41.161 --> 17:43.230
Powder up, everyone.

17:44.564 --> 17:46.566
(all shouting)

17:49.269 --> 17:50.703
-(laughs)
- Ay, ay, ay! (speaks Spanish)

17:50.737 --> 17:52.239
"Ay ay ay," indeed.

17:52.272 --> 17:54.774
(crowd gasping)

17:54.807 --> 17:56.943
Give us back our P.A.!

17:56.976 --> 18:00.547
The Americans, they have weapons
from the future.

18:00.580 --> 18:03.316
Yar!

18:03.350 --> 18:06.353
These weapons from the future,
they are not real.

18:10.357 --> 18:12.192
(imitating laser gun firing)

18:13.293 --> 18:14.894
(imitating laser gun firing)

18:14.927 --> 18:16.263
(groans)

18:16.296 --> 18:20.133
Stop shooting.
Stop shooting. Cut!

18:20.167 --> 18:23.236
Okay, that's a five.

18:23.270 --> 18:25.472
We don't have
your million dollars,

18:25.505 --> 18:28.275
but we can give you something
much more valuable:

18:28.308 --> 18:30.076
a Hollywood movie.

18:30.109 --> 18:33.980
All we want back is the
lowliest member of our crew.

18:34.013 --> 18:36.749
We could sell it to
the highest bidder at MIFED!

18:36.783 --> 18:37.984
You have a deal.

18:38.017 --> 18:41.588
No, no! You can't give away
my masterwork.

18:41.621 --> 18:44.991
"There's a light that shines
from star to star,

18:45.024 --> 18:49.262
from soul to soul, connecting
everyone in the universe."

18:49.296 --> 18:51.931
Be the man who believes
in those words,

18:51.964 --> 18:56.403
and let the light between me and
Homer give life to our universe.

18:59.206 --> 19:02.242
Gentlemen, the film is yours.

19:08.481 --> 19:10.617
You're a good man, Krusty.

19:10.650 --> 19:12.385
Only when I'm with you,

19:12.419 --> 19:15.888
which is why I never
want to see you again.

19:15.922 --> 19:18.291
I want that, too.

19:18.325 --> 19:20.993
I've done a lot of interviews,
man, but wow.

19:21.027 --> 19:24.063
I-I am so glad
that Byron Allen canceled.

19:24.096 --> 19:26.399
And after that,
my movie career was kaput.

19:26.433 --> 19:28.401
I was sent back to kids TV

19:28.435 --> 19:32.171
and never cared about making
anything good ever again.

19:32.205 --> 19:35.242
Well, folks, you heard it.
Who could ever forget it?

19:35.275 --> 19:39.579
A heartbreaking story about a
selfish man's one selfless act.

19:39.612 --> 19:41.080
Do you like hot cashews

19:41.113 --> 19:43.316
but don't have the time
to heat them up?

19:43.350 --> 19:46.686
'ShewBlasters is disrupting
the heated nut business.

19:46.719 --> 19:49.155
If the 'Shew heats, eat it!

19:49.188 --> 19:51.258
(Krusty groans)

20:03.102 --> 20:04.937
-BART: Mom! Dad!
-You guys never told us

20:04.971 --> 20:06.205
you worked on a movie together.

20:06.239 --> 20:07.674
So that's why
you've been wearing

20:07.707 --> 20:09.509
that crew jacket
all these years.

20:09.542 --> 20:12.445
That crazy movie? Oh, man,
that was a long time ago.

20:12.479 --> 20:13.946
We were just kids.

20:13.980 --> 20:15.181
What was it like?

20:15.214 --> 20:16.916
Well, working on that movie set

20:16.949 --> 20:19.252
turned out to be
a lot like our marriage.

20:19.286 --> 20:22.355
Long days, stupid fights
you don't remember,

20:22.389 --> 20:24.357
but damn good breakfasts.

20:24.391 --> 20:27.193
A good breakfast
can get you through a lot.

20:27.226 --> 20:30.363
But what happened to the movie?
Did Krusty ever see it?

20:30.397 --> 20:32.299
I don't know.
I guess we'll never know.

20:32.332 --> 20:33.366
(light buzzing)

20:33.400 --> 20:36.436
The love crystal
is whole once more.

20:36.469 --> 20:40.907
The prophecy is fulfilled.

20:50.317 --> 20:52.285
(laughter)

20:52.319 --> 20:55.588
-What? Why are they laughing?
-They think it's a comedy.

20:55.622 --> 21:00.159
(groans) It was supposed to show
how we're all connected.

21:00.192 --> 21:04.464
Look around, man.
Maybe it did, maybe it did.

21:04.497 --> 21:07.600
If you think this is closure,
you're nuts.

21:30.390 --> 21:32.492
CREW GUY:
Wahh-wahh.
