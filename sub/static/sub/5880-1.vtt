<i>I want to tell you about a man
I once knew.</i>

00:17.501 --> 00:22.690
<i>He lived in a land so beautiful
and white and silent,</i>

00:22.790 --> 00:25.943
<i>that if you scraped
a harpoon on the ice,</i>

00:26.043 --> 00:28.813
<i>you could hear it for miles and miles.</i>

01:42.020 --> 01:44.655
<i>We give thanks...</i>

01:44.755 --> 01:47.959
<i>for what the Earth provides.</i>

01:55.132 --> 01:58.366
<i>My people, the Inuit</i>

01:58.466 --> 02:01.875
<i>have lived here for thousands of years.</i>

02:05.376 --> 02:10.282
<i>But the land my forefathers knew
is disappearing.</i>

02:11.515 --> 02:17.622
<i>We can see the changes happening
before our very eyes.</i>

02:36.083 --> 02:38.342
<b>We have something to discuss...</b>

02:39.584 --> 02:45.619
<b>When you were a boy
you were taken from us.</b>

02:45.838 --> 02:49.447
<b>Even though you were schooled
by the southerners...</b>

02:49.547 --> 02:53.588
<b>we still loved you.</b>

02:54.337 --> 02:58.075
<b>But now, knowing their ways
will help you...</b>

02:58.175 --> 03:01.813
<b>for what lies ahead.</b>

03:03.467 --> 03:07.004
<i>They told him of a dream
passed down by the Elders.</i>

03:07.104 --> 03:11.476
<i>It would change his life and mine.</i>

03:12.436 --> 03:16.406
<b>...and then the Sun grew angry.</b>

03:17.196 --> 03:20.187
<b>It came down from the heavens
and it kissed the earth...</b>

03:21.691 --> 03:25.056
<b>and with that fatal kiss,
all things were ended.</b>

03:26.723 --> 03:31.512
<b>Now the ice is retreating.</b>

03:31.839 --> 03:37.158
<b>The dream is coming to pass.</b>

03:37.672 --> 03:39.614
<b>It is much to ask...</b>

03:39.674 --> 03:44.022
<b>but there is no one else
who speaks their tongue.</b>

03:45.094 --> 03:47.610
<b>You must go South.</b>

03:48.885 --> 03:50.648
<b>This is all that we could raise.</b>

03:50.748 --> 03:53.808
<b>These are tickets for air travel also.</b>

03:53.908 --> 03:57.264
<b>Do this thing, for our sake</b>

03:57.364 --> 03:59.917
<b>if not theirs.</b>

04:01.333 --> 04:03.838
<b>Tell their Elders of the dream</b>

04:04.386 --> 04:06.852
<b>so they understand that they must stop.</b>

04:08.395 --> 04:11.580
<b>If they do not</b>

04:12.308 --> 04:14.396
<b>we are finished.</b>

07:22.760 --> 07:26.664
<i>He lived his whole life
under a big open sky,</i>

07:26.764 --> 07:30.013
<i>hunting and fishing in the wilderness.</i>

07:30.868 --> 07:34.072
<i>But he found himself
in an unknown world.</i>

08:07.037 --> 08:10.407
<i>So he left his homeland
at the top of the Earth</i>

08:10.507 --> 08:12.743
<i>and he came to the South...</i>

08:12.843 --> 08:15.246
<i>where the rest of us live.</i>

09:54.111 --> 09:56.513
<i>Where is the silence?</i>

09:58.849 --> 10:01.218
<i>All these people.</i>

10:02.519 --> 10:04.762
<i>All this noise.</i>

10:06.023 --> 10:09.193
<i>It's getting closer and closer,</i>

10:09.827 --> 10:13.931
<i>and I am getting smaller and smaller.</i>

10:26.143 --> 10:29.364
<i>I must see the sky above me...</i>

10:30.147 --> 10:33.550
<i>in order to feel the ground beneath me.</i>

10:39.022 --> 10:41.926
<i>But here, with all this...</i>

10:43.760 --> 10:46.913
<i>it is difficult to feel anything.</i>

11:16.309 --> 11:20.431
<i>My parents call me Catherine,
but on the streets, I go by Chloe.</i>

11:20.931 --> 11:24.735
<i>And for me, that morning
was just like any other.</i>

11:35.412 --> 11:37.355
<i>Except...</i>

11:37.655 --> 11:39.631
<i>for one thing.</i>

11:45.622 --> 11:47.725
A freakin' Eskimo?

12:03.206 --> 12:05.146
Thank you.

12:29.466 --> 12:32.035
Yo... my man.

12:32.235 --> 12:33.671
- Hello!
- You lost?

12:33.771 --> 12:36.966
Lost, can't find your way home?

12:38.358 --> 12:41.545
Do you speak English?
Speak English? Good.

12:42.045 --> 12:43.547
Right, what we're going to do is...

12:43.747 --> 12:47.185
We're going to take you to wherever
you got to go, you feel me?

12:48.185 --> 12:50.714
I need to speak to your Elders.

12:55.323 --> 12:57.554
You want to speak to my momma?

12:58.695 --> 13:00.925
I have an important message.

13:02.432 --> 13:06.837
But listen here, so you could talk
to my moms, right... that's cool...

13:06.937 --> 13:11.491
but you got to pay me, alright?
<i>Dinero</i>... money.

13:11.591 --> 13:15.462
You understand that? Yes? Good.

13:15.562 --> 13:17.392
But you don't understand.

13:18.715 --> 13:23.554
No, homey, you see... see baby,
you don't understand.

13:24.054 --> 13:27.708
I understand, I understand
you're getting robbed, man.

13:27.808 --> 13:31.440
- Now give me your freakin' money.
- Yo, Mike! What'd I tell you, man?

13:32.400 --> 13:34.531
You all right?

13:34.631 --> 13:37.117
What are you doing?
Can't you see he's a friggin' bum?

13:37.217 --> 13:39.537
No, 'cause he... he was just
looking like a flippin' tourist.

13:39.637 --> 13:43.006
- He was like this, looking up at the sky.
- What's so good about looking down anyway?

13:43.106 --> 13:45.709
Would a tourist be dressed
like a friggin' Eskimo?

13:45.809 --> 13:49.847
No, he would not. Now why don't you go on
and find a yo-yo with some real dough.

13:50.247 --> 13:52.149
- Go on!
- Dude...

13:52.249 --> 13:53.978
Get out! Go on!

13:54.818 --> 13:56.653
You all right?

13:56.753 --> 13:57.854
- You okay?
- Yes.

13:57.954 --> 14:02.392
<i>Thanks to her. Yes, I think so.</i>

14:02.692 --> 14:05.723
<i>And that's when she agreed
to be my guide.</i>

14:07.398 --> 14:12.596
<i>For a small payment, she said
she would lead me to the Elders.</i>

14:13.069 --> 14:14.432
I got to start Miming.

14:18.775 --> 14:22.206
In here are all the old people
you'll ever want to meet.

14:23.246 --> 14:26.283
- These are your Elders?
- Not mine.

14:26.383 --> 14:29.079
But they'll do
for your age fetish, I think.

14:33.924 --> 14:36.159
Here's what we'll do,
I'll create a distraction.

14:36.259 --> 14:37.227
I don't understand.

14:37.327 --> 14:39.763
And you run in and talk
to all the elders you want.

14:40.263 --> 14:42.065
They look like prisoners.

14:42.165 --> 14:43.466
Now, pay attention,

14:43.566 --> 14:46.270
once I've taken out the first one,
I'll signal to you to "Go, go, go!"

14:46.370 --> 14:48.949
And that'll be your chance
and you'll explode into the common room

14:49.049 --> 14:51.119
and I'll block the door behind you.

14:51.808 --> 14:53.310
On three.

14:53.410 --> 14:56.647
One... two... three!

15:08.091 --> 15:09.329
Abandon the plan!

15:10.226 --> 15:12.747
Hey! Hey!

15:23.840 --> 15:26.670
Oh, man, I'm going to ache tomorrow.

15:27.944 --> 15:30.474
Those weren't the right Elders.

15:31.114 --> 15:34.284
- How did you get here?
- I walked.

15:34.384 --> 15:37.821
Look, you wanted to see old folks,
and I showed you old folks.

15:37.921 --> 15:40.752
Is that what happens
to people here when they get old?

15:46.113 --> 15:47.764
<i>In the city,</i>

15:47.864 --> 15:50.767
<i>life is very unfamiliar to me.</i>

15:51.067 --> 15:53.370
<i>But this interesting one,</i>

15:53.470 --> 15:58.502
<i>I hope she can help me make my way
in this strange wilderness.</i>

15:59.142 --> 16:00.971
This is it.

16:04.397 --> 16:06.158
Close the hatch when you come down.

16:22.132 --> 16:23.966
Tyler?

16:24.951 --> 16:27.615
Tyler! Lights.

16:32.342 --> 16:35.345
We agreed, it's just the three of us.

16:35.445 --> 16:38.238
Relax, Sancho. This is Teddy.

16:38.338 --> 16:39.343
Theo.

16:41.351 --> 16:43.003
- He's an Eskimo.
- Inuk.

16:43.103 --> 16:46.156
- On a mission to see old people.
- Oh, good.

16:46.256 --> 16:50.454
We agreed it's just the three of us
and you bring home a grandpa journeyman.

16:51.728 --> 16:55.454
He ripped off a mime today
and gave us 38 bucks.

16:56.399 --> 16:59.720
- You know how I feel about thieves.
- Yeah, you can't trust them.

16:59.820 --> 17:00.921
You can't trust them.

17:01.071 --> 17:04.574
Yeah, well, he didn't know he was
doing it at the time, so that makes it okay.

17:04.674 --> 17:06.576
- I'm not getting involved.
- With what?

17:06.675 --> 17:10.773
With anything.
I know how your mind works, Chloe.

17:16.685 --> 17:18.855
- We're married, you know.
- No, we're not.

17:18.954 --> 17:20.424
- We're getting married.
- No.

17:20.523 --> 17:22.192
- She's my girlfriend.
- Tyler!

17:22.291 --> 17:23.381
She's my friend.

17:24.327 --> 17:25.583
Let me show you your room.

17:29.399 --> 17:31.155
VoilÃ !

17:31.255 --> 17:32.936
- This is my room?
- Yep!

17:33.036 --> 17:34.537
- But I have a...
- Not another word.

17:34.637 --> 17:37.474
Tonight you are my guest,
so make yourself at home.

17:37.974 --> 17:39.292
Unbelievable.

17:39.392 --> 17:42.388
And this is my room.

17:45.582 --> 17:47.584
And who is this?

17:47.684 --> 17:49.352
Where've you been living,
the North Pole?

17:49.452 --> 17:51.955
- Close.
- Really?

17:52.255 --> 17:55.881
This is Bruce Lee. The great one.

17:55.981 --> 17:58.508
The master. The dragon!

17:58.608 --> 18:00.831
- He's dead.
- Or is he?

18:00.931 --> 18:04.227
- Six feet under, Chloe.
- Shut up!

18:05.318 --> 18:07.837
- Was he a warrior?
- The greatest!

18:07.937 --> 18:11.641
He was like... I don't know,
who's your greatest warrior?

18:11.741 --> 18:14.461
- We don't have warriors.
- You don't have warriors?

18:14.561 --> 18:16.030
What kind of people are you?

18:17.013 --> 18:20.383
Who's like, the baddest hunter
there's ever been in the North Pole?

18:20.483 --> 18:23.600
- Nanuk.
- Nanuk! He's like Nanuk, times a thousand.

18:23.700 --> 18:25.338
Nanuk is the Lord of the North.

18:25.438 --> 18:30.404
And Bruce is the Lord of everything else.
Here endeth the lesson.

18:30.927 --> 18:33.596
Sancho, what day is it?

18:33.696 --> 18:35.365
Tuesday.

18:35.465 --> 18:39.903
Monday's we eat Thai food.
Wednesday is Chinese.

18:40.003 --> 18:43.640
Thursday is Indian. Tuesday is Italian.

18:44.240 --> 18:46.395
Hey, here he comes.

18:52.749 --> 18:54.465
Pizza!

18:56.519 --> 18:58.182
Thanks.

19:00.940 --> 19:03.310
Come here. Food on your face.

19:03.960 --> 19:05.526
Good?

19:05.895 --> 19:09.453
- Are you sure you don't want any?
- Really good!

19:10.400 --> 19:14.354
- So what's the deal with the old people?
- It's a long story.

19:14.454 --> 19:16.456
- Is it a love story?
- No.

19:16.806 --> 19:20.010
- Kung Fu, yeah?
- I don't think so.

19:20.710 --> 19:23.546
Tell it anyway.
It's not like there's much on TV.

19:23.646 --> 19:25.202
Okay.

19:25.649 --> 19:31.988
Imagine a land so vast,
and beautiful, and silent,

19:32.088 --> 19:35.592
that if you take a harpoon
and scrape the ice with it,

19:35.692 --> 19:40.150
you can hear the sound
for miles and miles.

19:40.663 --> 19:44.436
<i>He talked about the oneness
his people have with the Earth.</i>

19:45.536 --> 19:49.593
<i>How they watched the moon
to determine when the animals migrate.</i>

19:50.340 --> 19:52.008
<i>But history isn't written,</i>

19:52.108 --> 19:56.679
<i>but is passed down verbally
from generation to generation.</i>

19:56.779 --> 20:00.016
<i>And then, he told us
about the Elder's dream.</i>

20:00.116 --> 20:02.585
<i>The legend of the angry sun.</i>

20:04.921 --> 20:09.408
<i>They told me,
these are the beginning of things.</i>

20:12.128 --> 20:16.499
<i>They told me I will live
on the never ending ice,</i>

20:16.599 --> 20:18.962
<i>under the midnight sun.</i>

20:21.871 --> 20:25.529
<i>They told me of Hysa,
the men of the South.</i>

20:25.925 --> 20:28.782
<i>Their capacity for destruction.</i>

20:36.753 --> 20:39.184
<i>Their need for expansion.</i>

20:40.356 --> 20:43.948
<i>Building structures
that scraped the clouds,</i>

20:45.495 --> 20:48.965
<i>and stopped the sun
from seeing the Earth,</i>

20:49.065 --> 20:53.624
<i>from seeing the planets,
from seeing the people.</i>

20:54.270 --> 20:58.591
<i>And the men of the South
grew sick and ugly.</i>

20:58.691 --> 21:02.950
<i>But still the refuse
of their ambitions spilled out.</i>

21:07.850 --> 21:13.423
<i>Burning the ocean and spreading across
the great country itself.</i>

21:14.123 --> 21:17.781
<i>And then, the sun grew angry.</i>

21:27.003 --> 21:29.627
Wait! Let me take this from the top.

21:30.807 --> 21:32.809
- Your name is Teddy.
- Theo.

21:32.909 --> 21:34.711
- And you are an Eskimo?
- Inuk.

21:34.811 --> 21:38.881
- From Antarctica?
- The Arctic. North, not south.

21:38.981 --> 21:41.384
- On a mission from God?
- From my Elders.

21:41.484 --> 21:43.874
About the end of the world?

21:46.690 --> 21:49.959
I need to speak to your Elders,
your leaders.

21:50.059 --> 21:52.416
The ones who the people listen to.

21:53.696 --> 21:55.732
You mean the President.

21:55.832 --> 21:59.790
- You want to speak to the President!
- If he is the leader of the south.

22:00.503 --> 22:01.672
The South?

22:02.939 --> 22:05.175
But... let me get this straight.

22:05.675 --> 22:07.386
Where you're from...

22:07.486 --> 22:09.379
- everything is south, right?
- Yes.

22:09.479 --> 22:14.304
So you want to speak to every president.
Every single one?

22:16.352 --> 22:19.289
- You're screwed.
- No, he's not. No, he's not screwed.

22:19.389 --> 22:22.892
Sancho, you're missing the one
crucial piece of this jigsaw puzzle.

22:22.992 --> 22:24.927
- Really?
- Yeah.

22:25.027 --> 22:28.051
- What?
- Me!

22:31.834 --> 22:33.986
You're screwed.

22:57.827 --> 23:00.884
My body is a friggin' temple.

23:06.436 --> 23:08.438
- You play chess?
- No.

23:08.538 --> 23:13.264
Mr. Sweet does.
He's like the best player in New York.

23:13.910 --> 23:18.678
He makes a pretty good living
hustling college kids and tourists.

23:19.415 --> 23:21.766
He's helped me out a lot in the past.

23:24.554 --> 23:27.790
- Did you sleep okay?
- I adapt.

23:27.890 --> 23:31.361
Yeah. You got to adapt, like water.

23:31.761 --> 23:34.547
You put water in a glass,
it becomes a glass.

23:34.647 --> 23:36.833
You put it in a bottle,
it becomes a bottle.

23:36.933 --> 23:40.036
You put water in a teapot,
it becomes a teapot.

23:40.236 --> 23:42.051
Be water, my friend.

23:42.703 --> 23:45.830
- Bruce said that.
- He was wise.

23:47.243 --> 23:49.871
Chloe! Come over here, girl!

23:52.348 --> 23:54.417
He's kind of mad. I...

23:54.817 --> 23:57.353
- Tyler.
- Hey, Theo.

23:57.453 --> 24:03.646
He wasn't too happy to hear
Chloe was picking up strays again.

24:16.906 --> 24:18.494
- What state you from?
- Non Ugak.

24:18.594 --> 24:20.092
- Language?
- Inuktitut.

24:20.192 --> 24:21.844
- Ever see a penguin?
- Only in books.

24:21.944 --> 24:25.035
- Ever build an igloo?
- Yes. Many.

24:28.117 --> 24:29.789
Yep.

24:29.889 --> 24:33.022
- He's an Eskimo all right.
- Inuk.

24:33.122 --> 24:36.859
In your what? Boy, I wasn't signifying,
I was testing you.

24:36.959 --> 24:41.118
That was a test. And you passed.

24:58.180 --> 25:00.717
That was one crazy story.

25:01.217 --> 25:03.319
But I don't buy that end
of the world nonsense.

25:03.419 --> 25:04.420
Look at him.

25:04.520 --> 25:07.157
I've been looking and it looks
like he's telling the truth.

25:08.363 --> 25:11.761
It may not end. It may simply change.

25:12.011 --> 25:13.668
But we will all suffer.

25:14.897 --> 25:17.266
Suffer? Have you seen
where we're sitting?

25:17.366 --> 25:20.758
- It's time for a revolution.
- No, it ain't.

25:21.571 --> 25:23.227
Okay.

25:24.340 --> 25:25.896
So...

25:26.609 --> 25:30.614
we in the south
is doing some real bad stuff,

25:30.714 --> 25:34.550
and the sun got ticked
and is coming down to bust heads.

25:34.650 --> 25:38.471
Now some dead dude is dreaming all this,

25:38.571 --> 25:41.224
leaving your people to send you here
to warn the President.

25:41.324 --> 25:46.720
- Every President.
- Yeah, yeah. Every President.

25:46.879 --> 25:49.732
- Why New York?
- I don't understand.

25:49.832 --> 25:53.803
- Why are you here in New York?
- They gave me a ticket.

25:54.203 --> 25:56.472
They didn't explain.

25:56.572 --> 25:59.192
- You didn't ask?
- No.

25:59.292 --> 26:02.478
Why not London, or Paris, or Tokyo?

26:02.578 --> 26:04.614
Do I need to be somewhere else?
I will go.

26:04.714 --> 26:08.351
How, brother? How?
You got some wings I don't know about?

26:08.951 --> 26:13.023
- I have legs.
- You can't be walking to Europe.

26:13.573 --> 26:15.266
Ain't you never seen a map?

26:18.027 --> 26:20.263
Where are you going now?

26:20.363 --> 26:21.298
Away.

26:21.398 --> 26:24.751
Ain't you been listening to me?
You need a plan.

26:24.851 --> 26:27.353
- No.
- No?

26:27.453 --> 26:31.307
- What will be, will be.
- Oh, come on.

26:31.507 --> 26:35.077
What am I doing here?
What will be, will be?

26:35.177 --> 26:38.898
Who do you think you are?
Some divine and glorious Buddha?

26:38.998 --> 26:41.884
And I'm taking you serious.
I tell you what...

26:41.984 --> 26:45.618
Why don't you stay here and Mr. Sweet
will split, 'cause I'm a busy man.

26:45.888 --> 26:50.447
I've got things to do and you need
to stop picking up strays.

27:00.069 --> 27:01.825
Thank you.

27:11.914 --> 27:13.870
What a shame.

27:15.785 --> 27:19.342
Hey, why are you so interested
in this guy?

27:20.556 --> 27:23.653
Chloe. Chloe!

27:25.161 --> 27:27.431
<i>What I see in this guy?</i>

27:27.980 --> 27:31.506
<i>I see innocence, and purpose,</i>

27:31.606 --> 27:33.360
<i>and meaning.</i>

27:33.836 --> 27:38.695
<i>I haven't believed in anything
for way too long.</i>

28:06.135 --> 28:09.505
So... you've been living here
the whole time?

28:09.605 --> 28:11.003
Been here one time.

28:11.103 --> 28:14.744
Once? How the hell did you find
your way back here from Harlem?

28:14.844 --> 28:19.515
Inuksuks. On the tundra, there are
no landmarks, so we build them.

28:19.615 --> 28:23.840
Here, there are many,
I don't need to build any.

28:25.287 --> 28:29.192
Why are you so down? Mr. Sweets'
a smart guy, but he ain't always right.

28:30.092 --> 28:34.363
This time he is. I don't know
anything about this place.

28:34.463 --> 28:36.999
That's what you're worried about?

28:37.099 --> 28:41.170
Look, right here is everything
you need to know about America.

28:41.270 --> 28:45.008
It's the standard form of education.
Schools are just used for socializing.

28:46.308 --> 28:48.622
<i>...unbelievable riches.</i>

28:55.651 --> 28:59.856
<i>The prize is the largest
in television history.</i>

29:01.123 --> 29:03.880
<i>Over ten million dollars.</i>

29:04.627 --> 29:06.005
<i>The stakes...</i>

29:07.121 --> 29:09.578
<i>are everything you've got.</i>

29:13.669 --> 29:15.305
I got to go.

29:15.405 --> 29:19.596
Bring the others.
There is plenty of room here.

29:29.685 --> 29:31.575
Teach me.

29:36.792 --> 29:40.847
<i>I needed to learn more
about my new environment...</i>

29:40.947 --> 29:42.619
<i>New York.</i>

29:46.368 --> 29:49.492
<i>I have to observe my surroundings...</i>

29:49.592 --> 29:51.622
<i>and the people.</i>

29:52.474 --> 29:54.610
<i>When I was a boy...</i>

29:55.010 --> 29:58.264
<i>we were taught
that we are stronger as a group.</i>

29:58.364 --> 30:00.082
<i>For example,</i>

30:00.182 --> 30:03.518
<i>I cannot harvest a Walrus all by myself.</i>

30:03.618 --> 30:05.275
<i>I must have help.</i>

30:11.293 --> 30:13.362
<i>Even with all this information,</i>

30:13.462 --> 30:17.867
<i>the Elders have so much to learn,
so much is discarded.</i>

30:18.567 --> 30:21.467
<i>But by using our resources,</i>

30:21.567 --> 30:23.922
<i>we can find our place.</i>

30:26.442 --> 30:31.447
<i>What I am realizing is that
when you are in an unfamiliar place</i>

30:31.547 --> 30:34.514
<i>you must establish community</i>

30:34.614 --> 30:36.650
<i>by reaching out.</i>

30:37.753 --> 30:40.110
<i>Connecting with nature.</i>

30:41.891 --> 30:45.220
<i>Communicating with the people
of the village.</i>

30:47.296 --> 30:48.595
<i>And finally,</i>

30:50.457 --> 30:52.164
<i>you can adapt.</i>

30:57.873 --> 31:01.231
<i>This way you can find people
who believe.</i>

31:02.611 --> 31:07.950
<i>I've been entrusted by my Elders
to deliver an important message.</i>

31:08.050 --> 31:10.626
<i>And I cannot do this alone.</i>

31:19.228 --> 31:22.031
A lot of people are starting
to listen to your boy.

31:22.131 --> 31:25.835
You think he's good for his cause?
A bunch of bums getting behind him?

31:26.135 --> 31:29.493
It ain't a cause, it's a quest.

31:32.174 --> 31:34.310
Tell him I know
why they sent him to New York.

31:34.410 --> 31:37.535
- Why?
- Just tell him.

31:41.517 --> 31:45.955
Check mate. That's fifty bucks, kid.
Double or nothing.

31:46.055 --> 31:50.426
<i>Isn't this the one area us girls
have never found a solution for?</i>

31:50.926 --> 31:53.924
<i>Well, now we have,
with the Shake Weight.</i>

31:54.024 --> 31:57.619
<i>Now we can shake our weight of firm
and fabulous arms and shoulders</i>

31:57.719 --> 31:59.656
<i>in just six minutes a day...</i>

32:00.402 --> 32:02.425
I need to walk.

32:07.843 --> 32:10.212
<i>When I think about this place,</i>

32:10.312 --> 32:12.366
<i>it's so easy to get lost,</i>

32:13.207 --> 32:15.348
<i>to lose your way.</i>

32:16.152 --> 32:20.656
<i>The people of the south
seem to be trying to find themselves...</i>

32:20.756 --> 32:22.858
<i>find their grounding.</i>

32:22.958 --> 32:27.163
<i>It's like they're being pulled away
from their center.</i>

32:27.663 --> 32:30.199
<i>They have every convenience
in the world,</i>

32:30.299 --> 32:35.304
<i>but they do not know what it is like
to walk under the big sky.</i>

32:35.404 --> 32:38.273
<i>So I must learn to live in their world,</i>

32:38.373 --> 32:40.964
<i>in the shadow of the skyscrapers.</i>

32:50.651 --> 32:52.588
An Eskimo.

32:52.988 --> 32:55.157
He's an Inuk.

32:55.457 --> 32:57.209
What are you doing here?

32:57.459 --> 32:59.276
I'm listening.

33:01.230 --> 33:04.434
He's here to save the world.

33:05.134 --> 33:07.178
From what?

33:07.278 --> 33:08.971
The sun.

33:09.571 --> 33:13.396
Why don't you guys sit down
and tell us about it.

33:14.877 --> 33:17.294
<i>If you really think about it,</i>

33:17.880 --> 33:22.351
<i>the environment is a school,
but without walls.</i>

33:22.751 --> 33:26.255
<i>We must be open to everything
it is teaching us.</i>

33:26.755 --> 33:28.791
<i>It really is a giver of life,</i>

33:29.591 --> 33:31.627
<i>and we must protect it,</i>

33:31.927 --> 33:35.652
<i>because things are changing
way too fast.</i>

33:38.934 --> 33:40.751
New York.

33:40.851 --> 33:43.462
You were sent here for a reason.

33:43.562 --> 33:45.441
- He's going to save the world!
- Easy, Tyler.

33:45.541 --> 33:48.744
No, no, no, no. I said, "Here."

33:48.844 --> 33:51.080
Now, why was he sent here

33:51.180 --> 33:55.084
if he needed to speak
to all the leaders of the world?

33:55.184 --> 33:58.041
- That's a good question.
- Why?

33:58.854 --> 34:00.995
Mr. Inuk...

34:01.095 --> 34:04.637
meet Mr. United Nations.

34:17.773 --> 34:22.911
<i>Of course, I'd already worked that out,
but coming from Sweet, it sounded better.</i>

34:23.011 --> 34:26.614
- ...but you still need a plan.
- And a suit.

34:26.715 --> 34:29.217
She's right, you're going
to need a suit.

34:29.318 --> 34:31.719
You can't go into that joint
looking like a...

34:31.820 --> 34:35.090
well, like a friggin' Eskimo.
You got to look cool.

34:35.190 --> 34:36.725
Or else they'll think you're crazy.

34:36.824 --> 34:39.594
Though, they're going to think that anyway
as soon as you open your mouth.

34:39.695 --> 34:41.797
Yeah, people think I'm crazy.

34:41.897 --> 34:43.866
We'll go shopping tomorrow.

34:43.966 --> 34:46.969
Okay. I'm outta here.

34:47.069 --> 34:49.905
I got to go before they close
the shelter.

34:50.005 --> 34:52.908
You're welcome to stay here
if you want to.

34:53.007 --> 34:56.378
What... and lose my bed?

34:56.777 --> 34:59.915
What'll happen
when you're not around anymore?

35:01.712 --> 35:03.973
But I'll be thinking.

35:32.714 --> 35:35.537
- We're close?
- Yes.

35:45.294 --> 35:47.917
I guess you'll be heading back after?

35:49.431 --> 35:51.967
- You miss it?
- Yes.

35:52.067 --> 35:55.625
The silence. The simplicity.

35:57.172 --> 36:00.329
Simplicity is the key to brilliance.

36:01.276 --> 36:02.999
Bruce.

36:07.516 --> 36:10.920
What about you. Do you miss your home?

36:11.420 --> 36:14.023
This is my home. Nothing to miss.

36:14.123 --> 36:16.110
What about your family?

36:18.093 --> 36:19.914
My dad...

36:21.144 --> 36:22.852
but...

36:22.952 --> 36:25.588
these guys are my family now.

36:27.803 --> 36:29.705
I've been on the streets so long,

36:29.805 --> 36:33.285
I can barely remember
why I ran away in the first place.

36:36.878 --> 36:38.585
I was a junkie,

36:39.185 --> 36:41.312
and a thief,

36:42.065 --> 36:46.328
until a couple of years ago.
That's when Mr. Sweet found me.

36:49.191 --> 36:51.805
Anyway, I chose to run,

36:52.205 --> 36:57.228
and I'm not saying that this is
the sweet life, but it was my choice.

36:57.649 --> 36:59.806
I can live with that.

37:10.612 --> 37:13.832
<i>Life is so full of difficulties,</i>

37:13.932 --> 37:16.051
<i>but in my homeland,</i>

37:16.151 --> 37:19.359
<i>our sense of family bunches together</i>

37:19.459 --> 37:22.637
<i>like a warm coat against the cold wind.</i>

37:22.752 --> 37:23.989
<b>Uncle!</b>

37:31.076 --> 37:32.496
<b>Uncle!</b>

37:33.307 --> 37:35.210
<b>God gave you legs.</b>

37:35.310 --> 37:39.555
<b>Yes, but my wife gave me this,
I know who I'm more afraid of.</b>

37:42.640 --> 37:46.721
- <b>You'll need some things.</b>
- <b>I can adapt.</b>

37:53.161 --> 37:55.255
<b>Take them anyway.</b>

37:59.112 --> 38:03.185
<b>For your mother's sake.</b>

38:23.685 --> 38:27.724
<i>We were taught that to waste resources
is a form of stealing,</i>

38:28.924 --> 38:31.361
<i>and we should never over harvest.</i>

38:32.461 --> 38:34.730
<i>I have observed that in New York,</i>

38:34.830 --> 38:37.902
<i>over harvesting has a special name.</i>

38:38.002 --> 38:40.023
<i>It's called shopping.</i>

38:45.807 --> 38:48.367
Would you like change?

38:49.010 --> 38:50.846
How much you got?

38:51.146 --> 38:53.949
No. We want a suit.

38:54.049 --> 38:55.859
A suit?

38:57.819 --> 39:01.077
Okay. Am I being filmed?

39:01.823 --> 39:04.126
- What?
- What?

39:04.296 --> 39:06.232
- What?
- What?

39:06.662 --> 39:08.751
- What?
- What?

39:10.050 --> 39:12.534
We just want a suit, please.

39:12.634 --> 39:15.829
- Yes, I heard that, but...
- But what, Tinkerbell?

39:15.929 --> 39:19.007
We want a frickin' suit! You need me
to slap the wax out of your ears?

39:19.107 --> 39:20.876
You want to try it, sister?

39:20.976 --> 39:23.296
<i>I chose to let that comment slide.</i>

39:23.396 --> 39:26.568
<i>To be the bigger person
in this situation.</i>

39:27.649 --> 39:28.751
I hate you!

39:28.851 --> 39:32.097
<i>We decided on somewhere
a little more reasonable.</i>

39:34.773 --> 39:36.379
Okay, let's shop.

39:56.798 --> 39:59.047
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Tyler, sit down.

39:59.147 --> 40:00.803
Okay.

40:02.117 --> 40:04.673
Presenting, Theo.

40:07.556 --> 40:08.690
Don't he look fly?

40:08.790 --> 40:13.323
- He looks so good. I would just...
- Yeah, super fly.

40:13.962 --> 40:15.897
You got the suit. I got the plan.

40:15.997 --> 40:19.576
Now all these degenerates
you've been talking to around town,

40:19.676 --> 40:23.192
I think they just might come in handy.

40:51.933 --> 40:54.793
Alright, I got your back.

40:55.136 --> 40:58.807
Don't take no for an answer
and keep your eyes peeled.

40:58.907 --> 41:01.243
You're not coming in with me?

41:01.343 --> 41:04.400
I think one freak at a time
is all they can handle.

41:06.214 --> 41:07.870
Come here.

41:08.183 --> 41:10.246
You can do this, Theo.

41:10.649 --> 41:14.581
- Just be you. Good luck.
- All right.

41:15.390 --> 41:17.145
Sorry.

42:14.549 --> 42:17.986
- Which one?
- Your first name.

42:18.086 --> 42:20.088
My first name...

42:20.188 --> 42:24.926
The day I was born in an igloo,
my mother gave me a name,

42:25.026 --> 42:28.385
naming me after her mother, Julia.

42:30.565 --> 42:32.922
Why were you at the U.N.?

42:38.473 --> 42:40.892
Because I was on a mission.

42:40.992 --> 42:43.280
A mission.

42:44.412 --> 42:48.850
You realize that just barging
into the U.N. is illegal.

42:48.950 --> 42:50.406
No.

42:52.087 --> 42:54.089
Well, you know...

42:54.189 --> 42:56.858
you call the King, the King.

42:56.958 --> 43:00.061
You call the Queen the Queen.
You call Mr. Sweet...

43:00.161 --> 43:01.297
- Mr. Sweet?
- ...Mr. Sweet.

43:01.397 --> 43:03.031
- Mr. Sweet?
- Yes, sir.

43:03.131 --> 43:05.855
What is your given name?

43:06.217 --> 43:07.216
Tyler.

43:07.802 --> 43:09.859
You're in trouble.

43:10.171 --> 43:13.508
Why were you at the U.N.?
What is her relation to you?

43:13.608 --> 43:15.977
- What's her name?
- Her name is Chloe.

43:16.077 --> 43:17.512
Chloe is not violent.

43:17.612 --> 43:21.883
I didn't mean to break the law,
but your stupid guards got in my way.

43:21.983 --> 43:24.753
We were trying to get in
to talk to the Elders,

43:24.853 --> 43:27.522
but for some reason
they wouldn't let us in.

43:27.622 --> 43:31.993
Who were the people that you
showed up to the U.N. with?

43:32.093 --> 43:33.975
Who are these people?

43:34.075 --> 43:37.265
They're my friends. They're my tribe.

43:37.365 --> 43:39.422
They're my nation.

43:42.070 --> 43:46.229
The sun is going
to create chaos in the world.

43:47.509 --> 43:49.865
We have angered the sun.

43:50.445 --> 43:54.770
So your message is based
on the sun's anger?

43:55.684 --> 43:58.181
And you're being sent by...

43:58.281 --> 44:02.134
a group of people to the U.N.?

44:02.557 --> 44:04.059
You were going there to hurt someone.

44:04.159 --> 44:05.728
- No! I was not...
- Let me tell you what I think.

44:05.828 --> 44:08.848
You were going there to hurt someone.
Do you understand what's going on here?

44:08.948 --> 44:11.299
I want to know why you
and the rest of your party

44:11.399 --> 44:14.169
decided to go to the U.N. unauthorized.

44:14.269 --> 44:16.354
You have serious problems.

44:16.454 --> 44:18.940
Why are you here?
That's what I need to know.

44:19.040 --> 44:20.595
- I'm not playing games with you.
- I'm not...

44:20.695 --> 44:23.248
You are in serous trouble.

44:24.446 --> 44:27.261
- Let go of me!
- Chloe?

44:35.056 --> 44:39.227
<i>I came to deliver a message
from the Inuit people.</i>

44:39.327 --> 44:41.426
<i>Are you listening?</i>

44:48.336 --> 44:51.606
<i>I screwed everything up,
like I always do.</i>

44:51.706 --> 44:53.334
Hey, yo.

44:53.434 --> 44:55.679
How's the Eskimo, man?

45:09.290 --> 45:11.126
Hey.

45:11.226 --> 45:13.862
Hi. Did you talk with the police?

45:13.962 --> 45:17.665
Yes, my lawyers did. Are you alright?

45:17.765 --> 45:19.634
I have some friends still in there.

45:19.734 --> 45:22.487
I know, I know. And I'm not sure
what I can do for them

45:22.587 --> 45:24.956
because we have to see
what they're charged with, but...

45:25.056 --> 45:28.420
the young girl,
she might be in a little trouble.

45:29.577 --> 45:31.734
Can we go some place and talk?

45:33.648 --> 45:36.317
You know, I heard your story
about the sun.

45:36.417 --> 45:40.722
I was listening at the U.N.
and I found it fascinating.

45:41.122 --> 45:44.312
I was sent here to deliver a message.

45:45.293 --> 45:46.178
But...

45:46.278 --> 45:50.082
The message I should be delivering
is to my own people.

45:50.732 --> 45:53.101
What is the message?

45:53.201 --> 45:55.103
We are too late.

45:55.203 --> 45:58.506
Your leaders don't have the power
to change anything.

45:58.606 --> 46:01.459
Your television sets
have the real power.

46:01.559 --> 46:04.513
They compel you to buy things
that you do not need.

46:04.863 --> 46:07.412
And envy things that are worthless.

46:07.512 --> 46:10.735
They tell you to drive cars
that cannot even move

46:10.835 --> 46:13.088
because everyone else is driving one,

46:13.188 --> 46:15.907
in cities where there is no clean air.

46:16.007 --> 46:18.434
They mock the way you look...

46:19.010 --> 46:20.986
and affect your happiness.

46:23.214 --> 46:25.650
What can your leaders do
about your nature,

46:25.750 --> 46:28.339
when it is so corrupted
that when you live each day,

46:28.439 --> 46:32.462
it's based on consuming,
devouring and wasting?

46:32.562 --> 46:35.802
Never happy until nothing is left.

46:42.567 --> 46:45.854
My message should be for my own people.

46:45.954 --> 46:48.406
We must prepare for the sun's kiss...

46:48.506 --> 46:52.598
for it is surely coming
sooner than we think.

46:57.615 --> 47:00.175
Theo! Wait...

47:00.275 --> 47:04.217
if you would agree to say exactly
what you just said in front of an audience,

47:04.317 --> 47:07.647
I swear that I will do everything
in my power to get your friends out of jail.

47:09.661 --> 47:15.221
Look, here's my card.
If you agree, that's my address.

49:18.723 --> 49:21.216
I heard what happened today.

49:27.732 --> 49:29.754
Are you pleased?

49:33.046 --> 49:34.686
No.

49:36.507 --> 49:38.309
So what next?

49:38.409 --> 49:41.129
I have Chloe's pictures.
Should I return...

49:41.229 --> 49:44.599
That's not what I'm talking about.
No, I mean, what are you going to do?

49:44.699 --> 49:47.122
I feel I should go home.

49:49.187 --> 49:51.990
Really? Go home?

49:52.090 --> 49:54.509
No, no, no, no, no.
That's not an option.

49:54.609 --> 49:57.395
You're the one that got
their hearts into this.

49:57.495 --> 50:01.420
I'm not saying that's a bad thing,
I mean, alright...

50:02.400 --> 50:05.837
Look around you. This is what we got.

50:05.937 --> 50:08.072
It's never going to get
any better than this.

50:08.172 --> 50:14.145
But you... you come into our lives,
it's different. Everything changes.

50:14.245 --> 50:17.615
For a minute, they get to feel
like they were somebody.

50:18.082 --> 50:21.586
They're not thinking about what they can't
do, they're thinking about what they can.

50:21.686 --> 50:23.942
You inspired them.

50:24.989 --> 50:27.056
You need to fix this.

50:27.458 --> 50:30.009
You started it, you finish it.

50:30.545 --> 50:31.902
You understand me?

50:59.924 --> 51:01.914
Good job.

51:05.263 --> 51:08.086
<i>So we talked almost all night.</i>

51:09.267 --> 51:12.403
<i>Monica wants to organize an event,</i>

51:12.503 --> 51:16.429
<i>so the leaders of the south
can hear my message.</i>

51:17.175 --> 51:21.712
<i>And I couldn't wait to share
the good news with my friends.</i>

51:21.812 --> 51:23.468
Theo!

51:43.534 --> 51:47.133
- Please have as much as you'd like.
- Check this out.

51:47.438 --> 51:49.073
Persian,

51:49.173 --> 51:51.776
about mid-eighteen century.

51:51.876 --> 51:55.134
From the look of it,
it's got to weigh at least 60 pounds.

51:56.481 --> 51:59.690
Well, I don't know how much
it weighs actually, but...

51:59.790 --> 52:03.255
you're dead on about the country of origin
and the age. How did you know that?

52:04.055 --> 52:06.758
I used to be in the rug business
when I was younger.

52:06.858 --> 52:09.028
- Selling?
- Stealing.

52:11.295 --> 52:13.000
Okay, well...

52:13.100 --> 52:16.301
thanks for getting us out and all that,
but we really got to get going.

52:16.401 --> 52:18.903
Tyler. Tyler!

52:19.003 --> 52:23.107
But there's lots of room here.
We will all be comfortable.

52:23.207 --> 52:27.278
- What... do you mean that...
- Oh, come on, we can't impose.

52:27.378 --> 52:30.915
Yeah, no, we can't impose.
Tyler, Sweet...

52:31.015 --> 52:34.152
It would make great use
of all this wasted space.

52:34.252 --> 52:36.456
Is that not true?

52:39.573 --> 52:44.116
Please, I insist. All of you,
you must be my guests while I...

52:44.216 --> 52:46.635
- arrange for Theo to speak.
- What?

52:48.149 --> 52:49.352
Juicy.

52:49.452 --> 52:51.185
<i>But who was this person?</i>

52:51.285 --> 52:55.990
<i>I mean, who lets four homeless people
just move into their house?</i>

53:01.946 --> 53:04.258
No!

53:04.899 --> 53:08.254
A knight moves like this...

53:08.654 --> 53:10.864
in an "L" shape,

53:10.964 --> 53:13.325
and it can jump other pieces.

53:14.208 --> 53:15.897
Okay.

53:17.578 --> 53:20.002
No! A Queen don't jump!

53:22.016 --> 53:24.385
She moves like this.

53:25.753 --> 53:28.182
- What about the King?
- A King is a lazy fool.

53:28.282 --> 53:30.829
He don't get nowhere fast.

53:31.926 --> 53:34.456
This is a Rook...

53:34.556 --> 53:36.597
or a Castle.

53:36.697 --> 53:40.455
He moves up and down or side to side.

53:42.136 --> 53:46.194
- But castles don't move.
- Are you messing with me?

53:54.181 --> 53:55.926
Hey!

53:56.026 --> 53:58.203
Want to take a seat?

53:58.753 --> 53:59.662
Why?

54:00.254 --> 54:02.390
I could show you how to use this thing.

54:02.490 --> 54:05.313
You could make yourself
useful around here.

54:05.726 --> 54:08.150
Oh, come on, it's fun.

54:13.167 --> 54:16.312
So, what we're trying to do here
is we're looking for companies

54:16.412 --> 54:21.065
that want to sponsor an event that Theo
would speak at, alright? So...

54:21.165 --> 54:25.880
What you do... so you have this little
box over here with the cursor,

54:26.180 --> 54:27.955
type in, say...

54:32.853 --> 54:34.455
And then you get a whole list.

54:34.555 --> 54:38.527
And you just click on one of them
with the tracking pad...

54:39.527 --> 54:43.097
and that's how you find
a list of potential sponsors.

54:43.197 --> 54:45.433
You think you could do that for me?

54:47.902 --> 54:49.770
You don't like me very much,
do you Chloe?

54:49.870 --> 54:51.860
What's there to like?

54:51.960 --> 54:55.177
Your money? Your house?

54:58.412 --> 55:00.782
So you think you're the only one
who's had it tough?

55:01.182 --> 55:04.825
I don't know you, I don't know your story,
I don't know what you've been through,

55:04.925 --> 55:07.822
and maybe it's been
very dark for you, but...

55:07.922 --> 55:09.933
but living on the street
does not automatically

55:10.033 --> 55:12.825
make you morally superior, Sugar.

55:19.467 --> 55:23.311
Yeah, castles don't move.
Once you build it,

55:23.411 --> 55:28.142
if the cornerstone is fixed properly,
solid foundation, it's not going anywhere.

55:28.242 --> 55:31.846
Look, man! I know the physics,
and I'm saying it don't matter!

55:31.946 --> 55:33.915
'Cause it's a game!

55:34.215 --> 55:37.835
- But it has no purpose.
- Of course it has a purpose!

55:37.935 --> 55:40.921
It's a game, its purpose is fun,

55:41.021 --> 55:46.248
and fun is what we having right now!
This is fun!

55:48.162 --> 55:50.230
I don't like fun.

55:51.165 --> 55:52.898
Jesus!

56:01.876 --> 56:04.178
Chloe, please open the door.

56:04.278 --> 56:06.981
Go away, Monica.

56:07.281 --> 56:09.750
I think you should come out here
so we can talk about this.

56:09.850 --> 56:13.387
If I come out there,
I won't be responsible for my actions.

56:13.487 --> 56:16.745
I am prepared to take
that chance if you are.

56:17.725 --> 56:20.785
- Seriously?
- Yes.

56:21.061 --> 56:24.165
Look... you don't trust me, right?

56:24.265 --> 56:26.000
No, I don't.

56:26.100 --> 56:29.837
Alright, I understand that.
But what can I do?

56:29.937 --> 56:32.440
You can start by telling me
why you're helping him.

56:32.540 --> 56:35.397
- Helping Theo?
- Yeah.

56:37.244 --> 56:40.528
Why do people always want
simple answers?

56:49.657 --> 56:52.049
Her name is Baruti.

56:53.761 --> 56:57.786
She was 18 months old in South Africa
when that picture was taken.

56:59.533 --> 57:01.936
Look at those bright eyes.

57:03.237 --> 57:07.808
When Baruti was two years old,
she developed full-blown AIDS.

57:07.908 --> 57:12.403
She was one of my patients
and our treatment could have saved her.

57:15.032 --> 57:18.205
But in the real world
things aren't that simple.

57:19.086 --> 57:23.958
Children are excluded from clinical trials
because it's considered child abuse

57:24.058 --> 57:27.361
to expose them
to experimental treatments.

57:27.461 --> 57:31.019
The powers that be
have their agendas and...

57:33.267 --> 57:37.171
and so instead of saving
this beautiful girl's life,

57:37.271 --> 57:40.608
I sat by her bedside every day,

57:40.708 --> 57:42.638
and watched...

57:42.738 --> 57:46.656
as the light went out
of those little eyes.

57:48.182 --> 57:50.417
And she was gone.

57:50.517 --> 57:53.220
Just as I sat and watched
countless others die,

57:53.320 --> 57:57.980
people I could have saved but I didn't
because the rules said I couldn't.

57:59.860 --> 58:01.498
So...

58:01.598 --> 58:04.140
after Baruti, I made myself a pact.

58:04.240 --> 58:08.085
No more rules, if I could help, I would.

58:08.185 --> 58:11.934
There's so much indifference in this world
that I can barely sleep at night,

58:12.034 --> 58:15.109
and if I could make one
tiny difference in something,

58:15.209 --> 58:17.532
I have to.

58:18.946 --> 58:21.409
That's the least I can do, right?

58:33.027 --> 58:34.682
Check.

59:40.060 --> 59:43.346
<i>I went to residential school,
and my Elders...</i>

59:43.446 --> 59:46.635
<i>had noticed that I could speak
your language a bit,</i>

59:46.735 --> 59:48.702
<i>so they sent me here.</i>

59:48.802 --> 59:52.606
<i>And you know, in their day...</i>

59:52.706 --> 59:56.977
<i>the Missionary run school,
so therefore religion was taught.</i>

59:57.077 --> 59:59.880
<i>Probably the first thing
that they taught us...</i>

59:59.980 --> 01:00:01.515
<i>I learned about God.</i>

01:00:01.615 --> 01:00:05.269
<i>And in the beginning
was the Earth, which is a gift.</i>

01:00:05.369 --> 01:00:09.523
<i>We have a responsibility
to look after what we have been given.</i>

01:00:09.623 --> 01:00:14.845
<i>But far too often, the inhabitants
are taking, and not giving back.</i>

01:00:14.945 --> 01:00:20.209
<i>So I was chosen by my Elders to bring
this message to the people of the South,</i>

01:00:20.709 --> 01:00:22.757
<i>and their leaders.</i>

01:00:27.541 --> 01:00:30.398
Okay, everybody, it's time to go.

01:00:30.978 --> 01:00:33.248
<i>It all sounded promising...</i>

01:00:33.747 --> 01:00:36.953
<i>Monica set up a meeting with people
who might support an event</i>

01:00:37.053 --> 01:00:39.823
<i>for Theo to deliver his message.</i>

01:00:40.304 --> 01:00:43.094
Okay, good. Come on then.
Come on, guys. Here we...

01:00:43.791 --> 01:00:46.827
All right guys, remember
this is really important, okay?

01:00:46.927 --> 01:00:51.486
Let's just let Theo do all the talking.
Alright? Come on.

01:01:04.545 --> 01:01:06.635
Come on in.

01:01:08.649 --> 01:01:10.384
Are there no stairs?

01:01:10.484 --> 01:01:13.487
- Yes, but we have to take the elevator.
- I'll take the stairs.

01:01:15.363 --> 01:01:17.831
- Don't be silly, it's on the 62nd floor.
- I'll find it.

01:01:36.794 --> 01:01:38.416
Great.

01:01:38.612 --> 01:01:41.034
- Michel Victor...
- Welcome.

01:01:45.836 --> 01:01:47.905
- This is Mr. Sweet.
- Okay.

01:01:55.963 --> 01:01:58.198
So... where's our guy?

01:01:58.298 --> 01:02:01.101
He's on his way,
he'll be here any minute.

01:02:01.601 --> 01:02:03.973
He just took the stairs.

01:02:04.872 --> 01:02:06.774
Is there a problem with the elevator?

01:02:06.874 --> 01:02:09.393
He's doing his part
to reduce his carbon footprint.

01:02:09.493 --> 01:02:11.831
- There you go.
- Good for him.

01:02:12.331 --> 01:02:16.934
You do realize, Monica, that the reason
that we have been waiting here for you

01:02:17.034 --> 01:02:20.020
is because we would like
to meet this Mr. Theo.

01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:24.692
Yes, I completely understand,
and I truly apologize for the delay.

01:02:24.792 --> 01:02:28.366
I was not aware that he had an issue
with that sort of mechanical conveyance.

01:02:28.466 --> 01:02:33.605
But... he is an amazing person
and fully worth the wait, I promise you all.

01:02:35.002 --> 01:02:36.351
Look, at the end of the day,

01:02:36.451 --> 01:02:40.107
your individual companies have made
great contributions to the world.

01:02:40.207 --> 01:02:44.094
But all of you sitting at this table
right now, if you joined forces,

01:02:44.194 --> 01:02:49.316
and help us elevate Theo to a place where
he can spread his message with his voice,

01:02:49.416 --> 01:02:52.586
- you all have a chance to save...
- I've had enough.

01:02:52.686 --> 01:02:55.439
I'm sure Theo is a great guy,
but I have another meeting I have...

01:02:55.539 --> 01:02:58.542
- Sit yourself down, lady!
- Excuse me?

01:02:58.642 --> 01:03:01.677
We came a long way to talk to you guys,
and right now the little guy

01:03:01.777 --> 01:03:04.698
is struggling up 62 flights
of stairs to talk to you.

01:03:04.798 --> 01:03:09.353
Look, this has gotten really uncomfortable
and very unprofessional.

01:03:09.453 --> 01:03:12.940
- I'm sorry, she shouldn't have spoken...
- No need to be sorry. Chloe is right.

01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:16.910
You've got the money, we all know that,
but do you have the heart?

01:03:17.010 --> 01:03:22.149
See, you've got to understand one thing,
you are not the only game in this town.

01:03:22.249 --> 01:03:23.884
You think you're checking us out?

01:03:23.984 --> 01:03:27.337
Every player in this city
wants a piece of us.

01:03:27.437 --> 01:03:32.526
But the question is,
do we want a piece of you? Okay?

01:03:32.626 --> 01:03:34.650
Now, I don't mean any offense.

01:03:34.750 --> 01:03:37.531
And nor do I, but waiting for him
to walk up 62 flights of stairs...

01:03:37.631 --> 01:03:41.169
Okay. Alright. Okay.
Just give me two minutes.

01:03:41.269 --> 01:03:44.125
- Two minutes.
- Two minutes.

01:03:46.073 --> 01:03:48.997
- Monica, can I have your computer?
- Come on, Chloe.

01:03:56.550 --> 01:04:02.056
<i>You see, the ice my people
depend on to survive is vanishing.</i>

01:04:03.056 --> 01:04:05.726
<i>It might seem insignificant to you,</i>

01:04:05.826 --> 01:04:08.328
<i>but if I don't bring you this message,</i>

01:04:08.428 --> 01:04:11.886
<i>our way of life will be gone.</i>

01:04:12.900 --> 01:04:16.870
<i>Here in the south,
you have not seen these changes,</i>

01:04:16.970 --> 01:04:18.993
<i>but you will.</i>

01:04:19.473 --> 01:04:23.707
<i>Our forefathers were wise
and taught us well.</i>

01:04:23.807 --> 01:04:26.011
<i>But the day will come</i>

01:04:26.111 --> 01:04:29.581
<i>when we ourselves will be forefathers.</i>

01:04:29.967 --> 01:04:32.890
<i>Are we being wise?</i>

01:04:33.854 --> 01:04:36.801
<i>My people ask you to act</i>

01:04:36.901 --> 01:04:40.163
<i>or it will be too late.</i>

01:04:45.198 --> 01:04:47.655
It was a long walk.

01:04:49.069 --> 01:04:51.189
Oh, Theo.

01:04:51.289 --> 01:04:53.711
The meeting's over.

01:04:54.942 --> 01:04:58.500
Yeah, they all waited
like half an hour for you.

01:04:59.946 --> 01:05:01.910
Lucky for you,

01:05:02.010 --> 01:05:05.711
your friends were there...
'cause they're going to back us!

01:05:13.927 --> 01:05:16.572
<i>It was an indescribable feeling.</i>

01:05:16.672 --> 01:05:18.582
<i>After everything we had been through,</i>

01:05:18.682 --> 01:05:22.974
<i>Theo's message was going to be heard
by people who can actually do something.</i>

01:05:28.008 --> 01:05:30.865
- To Theo.
- To Theo!

01:05:51.431 --> 01:05:55.457
I have something for you
since you won't accept my alcohol.

01:06:02.943 --> 01:06:05.412
- Oh, a box.
- It's not just a box.

01:06:05.512 --> 01:06:08.125
- Oh, okay.
- There's something in it.

01:06:14.454 --> 01:06:17.378
Take a look at this, guys.

01:06:21.411 --> 01:06:24.435
- You like them?
- Yes, I do.

01:06:25.232 --> 01:06:27.267
Just like walking on clouds.

01:06:27.367 --> 01:06:29.804
- We won't mention the sweatshops then.
- Sorry?

01:06:29.904 --> 01:06:32.260
No. What? Never mind. They're so cool.

01:06:33.473 --> 01:06:35.530
Makes me even taller.

01:06:37.497 --> 01:06:39.980
Theo! Come on, boy!

01:06:46.586 --> 01:06:49.309
Momma told me there'd be days like this.

01:07:00.834 --> 01:07:05.005
<i>You know... sometimes Theo
just needed to walk.</i>

01:07:05.405 --> 01:07:07.662
<i>To be under the sky.</i>

01:07:09.359 --> 01:07:13.247
<i>He helped me see the beauty
in the smallest things.</i>

01:07:13.897 --> 01:07:16.313
<i>To see the good in everyone.</i>

01:07:18.204 --> 01:07:22.624
<i>But it's hard to see the good
in what happened next.</i>

01:07:23.716 --> 01:07:27.094
<i>There are days
when I feel responsible...</i>

01:07:27.594 --> 01:07:29.951
<i>and my heart aches...</i>

01:07:31.031 --> 01:07:34.390
<i>because if I had known
what would happen to him,</i>

01:07:35.118 --> 01:07:38.047
<i>I never would have let him
out of my sight.</i>

01:08:56.732 --> 01:08:58.942
- <b>Where are you going?</b>
- <b>I'm leaving.</b>

01:09:00.002 --> 01:09:03.417
- <b>Why?</b>
- <b>Because you ask too many questions.</b>

01:09:04.334 --> 01:09:05.937
<b>Really?</b>

01:09:07.368 --> 01:09:09.687
<b>But I'll be back.</b>

01:10:46.393 --> 01:10:48.599
<i>What was I thinking?</i>

01:10:48.962 --> 01:10:52.353
<i>Something stupid and pointless.</i>

01:10:53.466 --> 01:10:57.391
Something wasteful
as Theo would have said.

01:11:00.373 --> 01:11:02.839
<i>Once you know the story...</i>

01:11:03.610 --> 01:11:07.197
<i>how this little Inuit guy</i>

01:11:07.297 --> 01:11:10.154
thought he could change
the course of history...

01:11:12.886 --> 01:11:16.756
and it wasn't because he wanted
to be rich or famous,

01:11:16.856 --> 01:11:21.319
it was just because he wanted
the world to stay beautiful.

01:11:22.195 --> 01:11:25.882
Because he wanted
to keep being an Inuit guy

01:11:25.982 --> 01:11:29.786
<i>living an Inuit life
like his Pa and his Grandpa.</i>

01:11:29.936 --> 01:11:32.411
<i>He just didn't know he could do it.</i>

01:11:34.541 --> 01:11:38.789
You know... I asked Theo
about his homeland one night,

01:11:39.179 --> 01:11:41.835
and I'll never forget what he said.

01:11:44.284 --> 01:11:47.117
<i>It is unlike anything you've ever seen.</i>

01:11:48.421 --> 01:11:50.416
<i>The snow...</i>

01:11:50.916 --> 01:11:52.818
<i>the stillness...</i>

01:11:53.693 --> 01:11:57.505
<i>it teases you and never lets you go.</i>

01:11:58.598 --> 01:12:00.211
<i>In this moment...</i>

01:12:01.311 --> 01:12:05.836
<i>you realize that you are standing
on sacred ground.</i>

01:12:07.340 --> 01:12:11.291
<i>Underneath you are cathedrals of ice,</i>

01:12:11.561 --> 01:12:14.462
<i>home to life we will never see.</i>

01:12:15.415 --> 01:12:18.134
<i>What song are they singing?</i>

01:12:18.818 --> 01:12:20.829
<i>What story are they telling?</i>

01:12:22.322 --> 01:12:24.700
<i>Will we care for them?</i>

01:12:25.325 --> 01:12:27.984
<i>Will we care for each other?</i>

01:12:28.461 --> 01:12:31.531
<i>This is my hope.</i>

01:12:31.631 --> 01:12:34.049
<i>This is my prayer.</i>

01:12:35.702 --> 01:12:38.945
If there's a heaven
like they say there is,

01:12:40.073 --> 01:12:43.252
<i>and it's all beautiful and white,</i>

01:12:44.377 --> 01:12:46.651
<i>then maybe he's home,</i>

01:12:47.547 --> 01:12:50.764
hunting and fishing and...

01:12:50.864 --> 01:12:53.650
walking friggin' everywhere.

01:12:59.959 --> 01:13:02.186
I know one thing though...

01:13:02.779 --> 01:13:05.418
it's time for a revolution...

01:13:06.316 --> 01:13:08.518
a revolution of the mind.

01:13:08.968 --> 01:13:11.404
Well, I must say you make
quite an impact with this story.

01:13:11.504 --> 01:13:14.694
<i>And I'm sure the people at home
will be thinking a little more</i>

01:13:14.794 --> 01:13:17.707
<i>about what it was that Theo said...
let me get it right...</i>

01:13:17.807 --> 01:13:20.347
"Caring for one another."

01:13:20.447 --> 01:13:23.149
<i>Now, if you don't mind my saying it,</i>

01:13:23.249 --> 01:13:27.037
<i>you yourself, you've come a long way.</i>

01:13:29.022 --> 01:13:32.719
I got a lot of people who... I love,

01:13:34.227 --> 01:13:36.484
<i>and who love me.</i>

01:13:37.397 --> 01:13:39.753
<i>And I'm tired of running.</i>

01:13:40.717 --> 01:13:43.242
<i>This is the sweet life,</i>

01:13:44.003 --> 01:13:47.440
and I have the rest of mine
to look forward to.

01:13:47.540 --> 01:13:49.898
Have any last words for our viewers?

01:13:55.315 --> 01:13:58.852
Don't think... feel.

01:13:59.302 --> 01:14:01.988
It's like a finger pointing to the moon,

01:14:02.088 --> 01:14:04.674
don't concentrate on the finger,

01:14:04.774 --> 01:14:07.712
or you'll miss all the heavenly glory.

01:14:09.062 --> 01:14:11.402
That was a profound statement.

01:14:13.266 --> 01:14:15.623
That was Bruce Lee.
