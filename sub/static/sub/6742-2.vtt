I have a test today.

to succeed, son?

09:09.067 --> 09:11.233
Why do you want
to do well in school?

09:17.433 --> 09:19.133

to my school.

Your goals
are directed outward.

09:28.233 --> 09:31.467
A boy like Randolph

09:31.500 --> 09:33.600

to gratify himself.

09:33.633 --> 09:37.233
This is the path
to moral decay.

The decadence
ruined this country

headed to Canon City,

it was safe.

about a film?

to ask questions, Joe.

17:19.567 --> 17:20.767
before his death.

17:20.800 --> 17:22.333
We've heard rumors

17:22.367 --> 17:24.167
the Man In the High Castle
is still alive.

17:24.200 --> 17:26.800
No, he's dead. We've
known for some months.

17:26.833 --> 17:28.433
We understand
a fourth suspect

17:28.467 --> 17:29.633
fled with the films
they were smuggling.

17:29.667 --> 17:31.100
A woman.

17:31.133 --> 17:33.567
You seem very well
informed,

17:33.600 --> 17:35.433
OberfÃ¼hrer Diels.

17:35.467 --> 17:37.333
What else do you
wish to know?

17:37.367 --> 17:40.400
Uh, we assume she fled
to the Neutral Zone.

17:40.433 --> 17:42.400
We need to know where
precisely.

17:42.433 --> 17:45.033
We are making inquiries.

17:45.067 --> 17:47.800
The FÃ¼hrer has decreed
these films be confiscated.

17:47.833 --> 17:50.767
Let me speak plainly,
Tagomi-san.

17:50.800 --> 17:53.533
If you don't find
this woman, we will.

17:57.200 --> 18:00.033
Duly acknowledged,
Ambassador.

18:02.333 --> 18:06.500
But, respectfully,
gentlemen,

18:06.533 --> 18:10.500
please be aware
you're on Japanese soil.

18:10.533 --> 18:16.233
We recognize the sovereignty of
the Pacific States, Minister,

18:16.267 --> 18:18.700
but this is a matter
of state security.

18:18.733 --> 18:20.133
Good day, gentlemen.

18:42.800 --> 18:44.367
Check, please.

18:46.300 --> 18:47.233
[cash register rings]

18:50.233 --> 18:51.600
3 marks.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.200
Here you go.

18:55.233 --> 18:57.400
You know what I was
reading just now?

18:59.233 --> 19:01.233
The Book of Ecclesiastes.

19:01.267 --> 19:02.533
Oh, yeah?

19:02.567 --> 19:05.467
It says all life
under the sun is futile,

19:05.500 --> 19:06.567
pointless,

19:06.600 --> 19:08.467
so we should
dedicate our life

19:08.500 --> 19:10.100
to what's beyond the sun.

19:11.667 --> 19:13.533
Sounds interesting.

19:13.567 --> 19:15.333
What's beyond the sun?

19:17.167 --> 19:20.467
The Japanese say
it's the emperor himself,

19:20.500 --> 19:23.200
beyond which there's only
duty to one's country.

19:23.233 --> 19:25.100
Self-sacrifice.

19:25.133 --> 19:26.567
And the Nazis?

19:28.100 --> 19:29.667
They say
there's nothing at all.

19:29.700 --> 19:31.200
What do you say?

19:31.233 --> 19:34.200
Chapter 12, verse 5.

19:38.733 --> 19:41.167
You can pick up a copy
at the bookstore.

19:53.533 --> 19:55.133
Raeder: You spoke
to Joe Blake this morning.

19:55.167 --> 19:56.633
Smith: I did.

19:56.667 --> 19:59.167
He should have been
contacted by now.

19:59.200 --> 20:01.700
Well, it appears
his contact
is being cautious.

20:03.233 --> 20:05.067
You don't think
they suspect him.

20:05.100 --> 20:06.033
They suspect everyone.

20:08.067 --> 20:10.233
Steady, Erich.

20:10.267 --> 20:11.533
The bigger the fish,

20:11.567 --> 20:13.567
the greater the patience
to catch it.

20:13.600 --> 20:15.233
This so-called Man
In the High Castle.

20:15.267 --> 20:16.533
Reich Minister Goebbels says

20:16.567 --> 20:18.733
that not even
Fraulein Riefenstahl

20:18.767 --> 20:20.500
could make films
of such sophistication.

20:20.533 --> 20:22.367
If he made them.

20:22.400 --> 20:23.800
I don't understand.

20:23.833 --> 20:25.400
If he didn't, who did?

20:30.700 --> 20:32.733
I've heard strange rumors.

20:32.767 --> 20:34.233
Rumors?

20:34.267 --> 20:36.067
That the FÃ¼hrer
considers the films

20:36.100 --> 20:39.067
a threat to the very
existence of the Reich.

20:39.100 --> 20:40.567
That's why he's so
obsessed with them.

20:42.300 --> 20:44.300
Preposterous, isn't it?

20:44.333 --> 20:46.567
The FÃ¼hrer is not inclined
to idle obsession.

20:47.667 --> 20:50.100

22:34.067 --> 22:35.300
Hey, Ed.

22:40.733 --> 22:42.733
Mr. Windham-Matson, sir.

22:42.767 --> 22:44.367
Hey, good morning, Ed.
How's your grandfather?

22:44.400 --> 22:45.567
He's fine, sir,
thank you.

22:45.600 --> 22:47.767
That should have
two more cases on it.

22:47.800 --> 22:49.167
What can I help you with?

22:49.200 --> 22:50.800
It's Frank Frink, sir.

22:50.833 --> 22:52.333
I was wondering if he
phoned in sick today.

22:52.367 --> 22:54.233
No, he hasn't.

22:54.267 --> 22:57.067
It's just that his phone
doesn't pick up.

22:57.100 --> 23:00.033
Do you mind if I check
to see if he's okay?

23:00.067 --> 23:01.433
You can dock my pay,
of course.

23:01.467 --> 23:02.800
Go on.

23:02.833 --> 23:04.600
Thank you, sir.

23:04.633 --> 23:06.200
And don't worry.
I will!

23:14.167 --> 23:14.967
Frank.

23:18.833 --> 23:21.733
Frank.
Is that your name?

23:24.567 --> 23:25.767
Over here.

23:41.133 --> 23:42.533
It's okay.
I'm a friend.

23:42.567 --> 23:45.300
I gave that film
to Trudy Walker.

23:45.333 --> 23:47.400
Then you're definitely
not a friend.

23:47.433 --> 23:50.733
You got to tell them I have
nothing to do with this.

23:50.767 --> 23:52.467
I'd save you if I could.

23:52.500 --> 23:54.133
I can't.

24:05.467 --> 24:07.433
Who the hell are you?

24:07.467 --> 24:09.667
A man, just like you.

24:09.700 --> 24:11.367
A man who wants
to breathe free.

24:11.400 --> 24:14.367
Spare me the propaganda
bullshit, all right?

24:14.400 --> 24:15.667
I meant your name.

24:18.800 --> 24:20.133
Randall.

24:20.167 --> 24:21.433
Well, Randall,

24:21.467 --> 24:22.667
I don't want
your type of freedom.

24:22.700 --> 24:24.333
I don't want anything.

24:25.600 --> 24:30.167
It takes a lot of effort
not to be free--

24:30.200 --> 24:32.700
keeping your head down,
holding your tongue.

24:32.733 --> 24:36.467
I'm all for
keeping my head down
and my mouth shut,

24:36.500 --> 24:38.467
as long as I get to live.

24:38.500 --> 24:41.200
There's things worth
more than your life,
and you know it.

24:46.133 --> 24:48.033
You know where Trudy's
sister went.

24:52.767 --> 24:55.100
Don't you?

24:55.133 --> 24:57.333
What do you know about that?

24:57.367 --> 24:59.433
The question is
what do you know?

25:04.467 --> 25:07.533
Yeah, you know
where she went.

25:07.567 --> 25:09.400
Why don't you tell them?

25:13.200 --> 25:15.333
They'll kill me anyway.

25:15.367 --> 25:16.367
Maybe.

25:17.833 --> 25:21.233
Why don't you tell them
and see what happens?

25:21.267 --> 25:24.300
If you can believe
they'll keep their word.

25:30.500 --> 25:32.233
Hey, can I take a break?

25:34.633 --> 25:36.767
- Ten minutes.
- Thank you.

Mm-hmm.

26:02.267 --> 26:07.767

26:20.600 --> 26:22.267
Hello.

26:26.100 --> 26:28.500
I'm, uh, I'm looking
for a Bible.

26:31.100 --> 26:32.433
A Bible?

26:32.467 --> 26:35.767
Old Testament, please.

26:35.800 --> 26:37.600
King James translation.

26:40.233 --> 26:42.500
What makes you think
I have one of those?

26:42.533 --> 26:44.333
Someone told me you did.

26:48.733 --> 26:50.233
It's not like they're
illegal or anything.

26:50.267 --> 26:52.000
Right?

26:54.567 --> 26:56.567
No laws around here.

26:57.767 --> 27:00.700
They may not be illegal,
but, uh,

27:00.733 --> 27:03.100
that doesn't exactly
make them legal,

27:03.133 --> 27:05.567
if you know what I mean.

27:05.600 --> 27:07.467
Of course.

27:11.833 --> 27:13.500
Do you have one?

27:15.733 --> 27:17.033

28:03.767 --> 28:05.700
Are you all right,
ObergruppenfÃ¼hrer?

28:05.733 --> 28:07.400
- How's Erich?
- He's in critical condition.

28:07.433 --> 28:09.767
One of the bullets
lodged only 2 inches
from his heart.

28:09.800 --> 28:11.300
I'm afraid I have
more bad news, sir.

28:11.333 --> 28:12.567
Don't be coy, Lawrence.

28:12.600 --> 28:14.100
It's HauptaturmfÃ¼hrer
Lautz.

28:14.133 --> 28:15.167
His vehicle's
gone missing.

28:15.200 --> 28:16.567
Missing when?

28:16.600 --> 28:18.400
Last seen crossing
the Pelham Bridge at 8:41.

28:18.433 --> 28:19.633
No sign of him
or his driver since.

28:19.667 --> 28:21.333
These were
coordinated attacks,

28:21.367 --> 28:23.533
reprisals for the Resistance
leader we killed.

28:23.567 --> 28:25.400
What about the man
I apprehended?

28:25.433 --> 28:27.467
A Semite, sir,
known as Doc,

28:27.500 --> 28:28.600
Born Jason Meyer.

28:28.633 --> 28:30.567

Cincinnati Camp,

28:30.600 --> 28:32.533

28:32.567 --> 28:33.767
We wipe them out,

28:33.800 --> 28:35.433
yet they keep coming
back like lice.

28:35.467 --> 28:38.233
Lice don't assassinate
Nazi officers.

28:38.267 --> 28:39.333
I only meant--

28:39.367 --> 28:40.667
It may reassure you

28:40.700 --> 28:43.100
to liken terrorists
to insects,

28:43.133 --> 28:45.467
but they inflicted great
damage on us today.

28:45.500 --> 28:46.800
Never underestimate them.

28:46.833 --> 28:48.600
Yes, ObergruppenfÃ¼hrer.

28:48.633 --> 28:51.367
I vary my route
every day,

28:51.400 --> 28:54.600
and yet this Semite
knew exactly
where to find us.

28:54.633 --> 28:56.633
- How could he, sir?
- I don't know.

28:58.633 --> 29:00.467
But I intend to find out.

29:07.367 --> 29:09.000

the chains,

going to get out of here?

29:42.133 --> 29:44.433
Fuck! [grunting]

29:51.200 --> 29:52.767
Was it worth it?

29:52.800 --> 29:57.067
All so you could pass on
that stupid film of yours.

29:57.100 --> 29:59.333
That film can
change the world.

29:59.367 --> 30:01.600
Yeah, it certainly
changed mine.

30:01.633 --> 30:03.800
Why do you think
they torture us?

30:03.833 --> 30:05.800
I got a feeling you're
going to tell me.

30:05.833 --> 30:08.167
Because they know that
that film shows the world

30:08.200 --> 30:11.100
not as it is
but as it could be.

30:11.133 --> 30:12.533
Yeah, well,
in this world,

30:12.567 --> 30:13.667
they flattened D.C.
with an A bomb.

30:13.700 --> 30:14.733
How do you people
think a film

30:14.767 --> 30:16.100
is going to fight
against that?

30:16.133 --> 30:18.133
- "You people"?
- Yeah, you people.

in the Resistance.

anyway, huh?

30:21.400 --> 30:23.333
What, like seven,
ten, 12?

30:23.367 --> 30:26.367
You really think
you're going to defeat
the Japanese?

30:26.400 --> 30:28.467
The Nazis?

30:28.500 --> 30:30.267
Of course.

That's not the way
it looks from here!

He's 10.

- How much?
- 3 marks.

who just came in here,

31:38.267 --> 31:39.467
what did she buy?

31:39.500 --> 31:41.300
What gal?

31:41.333 --> 31:42.467
The pretty one? You know?

31:42.500 --> 31:43.667
She was just in here
a few minutes ago.

31:45.800 --> 31:48.033
I'm sorry. I don't
remember any gal.

33:55.367 --> 33:57.800
Ah, Mr. Baynes,
good to se you again.

33:57.833 --> 33:59.233
Mr. Tagomi.

33:59.267 --> 34:00.533
- Please.
- Thanks.

34:06.367 --> 34:08.133
I see you've
brought me something.

34:08.167 --> 34:10.300
Textile samples.

34:10.333 --> 34:12.700
Finest

34:12.733 --> 34:15.067
Oh!

34:15.100 --> 34:18.000
Our distributors
will be delighted.

34:24.833 --> 34:27.800
I trust your visit has been
uneventful, Colonel Wegener.

34:27.833 --> 34:31.233
Until I received your call
this afternoon.

34:31.267 --> 34:33.200
Is everything all right
with the Crown Prince?

34:33.233 --> 34:37.133
Yes. His ship will dock
tomorrow morning as scheduled.

34:37.167 --> 34:38.667
Then why have I been called?

34:38.700 --> 34:41.233
Your meeting
must be canceled.

34:41.267 --> 34:42.533
Canceled?

34:42.567 --> 34:44.533
Ambassador Reiss
came to see me today,

34:44.567 --> 34:46.633
along with an S.S.
officer-- Diels.

34:46.667 --> 34:48.133
I know who he is.

34:48.167 --> 34:50.467
He reports directly
to Heydrich in Berlin.

34:50.500 --> 34:52.367
They're determined
to find a woman

34:52.400 --> 34:55.600
smuggling a film
destined for the Man
In the High Castle.

34:55.633 --> 34:57.400
What does that
have to do with us?

34:57.433 --> 34:59.633
We did not inform them
about the smuggler,

34:59.667 --> 35:01.033
and yet they knew.

35:01.067 --> 35:02.733
It's clear
your Nazi colleagues

35:02.767 --> 35:05.300
have infiltrated our
security services.

35:05.333 --> 35:07.200
It's hardly a surprise.

35:07.233 --> 35:09.333
To this degree
the risk is too great.

35:11.300 --> 35:13.033
Is that what your sticks
tell you?

35:13.067 --> 35:15.800
Do you know
how long I've worked

35:15.833 --> 35:17.400
to organize this meeting?

35:17.433 --> 35:19.333
The risk I've taken
to come here?

35:19.367 --> 35:21.500
- I understand.
- I don't think you do.

35:21.533 --> 35:24.233
The FÃ¼hrer is ill,
and he could die,

35:24.267 --> 35:26.200
and when he does,

35:26.233 --> 35:29.667
there will be a war
between our empires,
Mr. Tagomi.

35:29.700 --> 35:32.100
There will be another time.

35:32.133 --> 35:34.500
I cannot travel twice on
a forged Swedish passport.

35:34.533 --> 35:35.667
I'll be shot.

35:35.700 --> 35:38.233
Give me the secrets.

35:38.267 --> 35:39.500
Let me deliver them.

35:40.733 --> 35:42.433
And if that oracle of yours

35:42.467 --> 35:45.233
tells you not to go
through with it?

35:50.567 --> 35:53.267
You said it yourself,
Mr. Tagomi.

35:53.300 --> 35:56.367
Destiny
is in the hands of men.

35:56.400 --> 36:00.600
I'm afraid this time
that means me.

36:23.567 --> 36:25.433
Mrs. Crothers, isn't it?

36:25.467 --> 36:26.467
Yes.

36:26.500 --> 36:27.600
I'm Chief Inspector Kido.

36:27.633 --> 36:29.033
Thank you for coming in.

36:31.367 --> 36:34.400
Well, we weren't given
a choice, actually.

36:34.433 --> 36:36.467
We appreciate
your cooperation.

36:36.500 --> 36:40.633

What's this about, Inspector?

36:54.800 --> 36:56.333
Oh, it's a formality.

36:56.367 --> 36:58.333
We're reviewing the records
of your brother.

36:58.367 --> 37:00.067
Frank? Is he okay?

37:00.100 --> 37:01.633
He's fine. Please,

37:01.667 --> 37:04.267
we have a very comfortable
waiting room down the hall.

37:04.300 --> 37:06.367
I'll be with you
as soon as possible.

37:06.400 --> 37:08.200
How long will we be here?

37:08.233 --> 37:09.467
Not long,

37:09.500 --> 37:10.500
I hope.

Yes. Yes, of course.

37:44.367 --> 37:46.667

comfortable.

38:29.500 --> 38:32.000
You've heard of Zyklon D?

38:36.800 --> 38:39.800
It's a gas. It's a gas.

38:39.833 --> 38:42.800
It is much improved

39:08.167 --> 39:11.633
We know Miss Walker
met her at an herb shop.

39:11.667 --> 39:15.500
We know she gave her
the film.

39:15.533 --> 39:18.800
We even know she took it
to the Neutral Zone.

39:18.833 --> 39:22.133
We believe she was
at the bus terminal.

39:22.167 --> 39:25.767
So all you need to tell us
is which bus she boarded.

39:28.467 --> 39:30.467
Where is Juliana Crain?

39:35.667 --> 39:38.200
Is it worth dying for her?

you are a failure?

I don't make it back,

do you think I could
ask you to get this

50:51.100 --> 50:53.467
Not one of ours.

50:53.500 --> 50:57.700
He's probably eliminated
quite a few subversives.

50:57.733 --> 50:59.167
I see.

50:59.200 --> 51:02.400
Your mission's
off the books, Joe.

51:02.433 --> 51:04.400
I suggest you steer
clear of him.

51:04.433 --> 51:05.400
I'll do that, sir.

51:05.433 --> 51:07.033
Good.

51:07.067 --> 51:08.033
Heil Hitler.

51:08.067 --> 51:09.233
Heil Hitler.

51:23.833 --> 51:25.067
[guard shouting in Japanese]

51:25.100 --> 51:27.267
No! Not them!

51:27.300 --> 51:28.567
Laura!

51:28.600 --> 51:30.500
You can't kill them!

51:30.533 --> 51:32.500
You can't kill them!

52:25.600 --> 52:27.200
[shouting in Japanese]

52:35.200 --> 52:36.567
[shouting]

52:46.833 --> 52:48.800
Interesting spot
for a chat.

52:48.833 --> 52:51.333
I wanted to make sure
we were alone.

52:57.133 --> 52:59.400
She was picked up a few
hours ago in Oakland.

52:59.433 --> 53:02.067
We found this
among her things.

53:02.100 --> 53:04.433
Trudy Walker's satchel.

53:04.467 --> 53:05.567
And the film?

53:05.600 --> 53:07.700
Three counterfeit
newsreels.

53:10.367 --> 53:12.500
We've been
chasing a dead end.

53:20.700 --> 53:22.733
No. No. No.

53:37.300 --> 53:38.467
The film.

53:56.067 --> 53:57.800
Excellent work, Trudy.

53:57.833 --> 53:58.767
No!

53:59.833 --> 54:01.367
[Japanese order]

54:02.600 --> 54:04.267
Uhh!

54:04.300 --> 54:06.467
No!

54:08.200 --> 54:10.067
[gibbering]

54:11.533 --> 54:12.567
No!

54:13.633 --> 54:15.167
[Japanese order]

54:39.633 --> 54:42.367
Aah!

54:49.300 --> 54:51.567
[Japanese orders]

54:54.800 --> 54:57.367
[panting]

55:23.333 --> 55:24.767
Hey.

55:24.800 --> 55:26.367
Hey, hey.

55:26.400 --> 55:29.367
It's me. Okay?

55:38.433 --> 55:40.400
It's okay.

55:41.633 --> 55:43.433
It's okay.

55:43.467 --> 55:45.567
Here.

55:53.667 --> 55:57.433
- [sobbing]
- Hey. It's okay.

55:58.500 --> 55:59.433
It's okay.

56:02.200 --> 56:04.800
Come on.

56:04.833 --> 56:06.167
- Come on.
- [sobbing]

56:06.200 --> 56:07.600
I got you.
It's okay.

56:46.400 --> 56:48.367
Hey, Frank.

56:48.400 --> 56:50.067
They said
you can go home.

56:54.067 --> 56:56.267
Kido: Our suspect
has been arrested.

56:56.300 --> 56:58.367
What?

56:58.400 --> 57:00.133
A suspect was arrested.

57:00.167 --> 57:02.233
A woman
who's a known smuggler

57:02.267 --> 57:04.267
carrying Trudy Walker's
satchel.

57:04.300 --> 57:06.633
Juliana doesn't
have the film.

57:06.667 --> 57:10.233
So it would appear.

57:10.267 --> 57:12.500
My sister? Her kids?

57:22.100 --> 57:24.667
No, no.
No, my sister. Her kids.

57:27.433 --> 57:30.700
We found out too late,
Mr. Frink.

57:30.733 --> 57:32.467
But you are free to go.

57:32.500 --> 57:35.167
No, no, no.
I-- I'm free to go?

57:35.200 --> 57:37.633
I am free to go?

57:44.767 --> 57:47.267
You have suffered enough,

57:47.300 --> 57:49.333
and I am not a monster.

57:52.300 --> 57:55.433
If you ever need
any more Jews to kill,

57:55.467 --> 57:57.433
you know where to find me.

58:00.467 --> 58:03.700
Yes. I do.
