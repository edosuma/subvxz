00:26.360 --> 00:28.320
This is Fauzi Nidal.

00:28.390 --> 00:30.260
Leave a message and
I'll call you back.

00:32.159 --> 00:35.000
Fauzi, it's, uh... it's me again.
Barry.

00:35.070 --> 00:36.600
Um... Bassam.

00:36.670 --> 00:40.070
Uh, I'm not sure if you're
getting my messages,

00:40.140 --> 00:44.070
but, um, I'm coming for
my nephew's wedding.

00:44.140 --> 00:46.240
Uh, arriving tomorrow.

00:46.310 --> 00:50.580
My US cell number
should work, so, uh...

00:50.650 --> 00:52.310
so call me.

00:52.380 --> 00:55.920
It would be good to see you.

01:33.420 --> 01:38.330
Jamal, fix your button.

01:38.390 --> 01:42.030
How do you expect people to respect
you if you can't dress yourself?

01:50.440 --> 01:52.840
Jamal. Bassam.

01:52.910 --> 01:54.140
Come on, Jamal. Come out.

01:54.210 --> 01:56.910
Khaled! Khaled! Khaled!

01:56.980 --> 02:01.380
Khaled! Khaled! Khaled! Khaled!

02:01.450 --> 02:04.150
Khaled! Khaled!

02:04.220 --> 02:06.120
Wave, Jamal.

02:07.190 --> 02:10.360
Not like a girl. Wave.

02:16.460 --> 02:18.630
Jamal, go stand over there.

02:23.320 --> 02:24.680
Mr. President.

02:24.710 --> 02:27.310
My son will cut the ribbon.

02:33.410 --> 02:38.720
It is a great honor... to
be standing here with you,

02:38.790 --> 02:41.120
the good people of Ma'an.

02:49.460 --> 02:54.530
This ground, once stained
with the blood and tears

02:54.600 --> 03:01.410
of conflict, has been cleansed
by the sweat of your good work.

03:03.510 --> 03:07.680
This bridge is more than
just steel and concrete.

03:07.750 --> 03:12.750
It is a symbol that despite
our differences...

03:18.270 --> 03:20.060
Get down, Bassam!

03:38.440 --> 03:40.810
Hello, Mrs. Shapiro.

03:40.880 --> 03:43.280
I'm sorry to
call so early, Doctor, but

03:43.350 --> 03:44.650
Danny's been coughing all night.

03:44.720 --> 03:47.750
Uh, well, uh, Dr. Chang

03:47.780 --> 03:50.120
is covering my patients this week,
so let me give you his service number...

03:50.190 --> 03:53.420
I'm sure he's
fine, but I really trust you.

03:53.490 --> 03:54.620
I'm glad you trust me,

03:54.690 --> 03:58.460
but he's an excellent doctor and
I'm about to leave town, s...

03:58.530 --> 04:02.200
I get that you're busy,
but what if he has strep?

04:02.270 --> 04:06.900
No, I, uh, I
understand, I do, uh...

04:06.970 --> 04:08.940
I'll be at my office
in ten minutes.

04:09.010 --> 04:10.570
Thank you, Dr. Al Fayeed.

04:10.640 --> 04:12.440
Okay. Bye.

04:14.750 --> 04:17.050
I can't believe you're
making us go to this wedding

04:17.110 --> 04:18.850
when they're burning pictures
of Grandpa on the street.

04:18.920 --> 04:19.980
Emma, get off the Internet.

04:20.050 --> 04:23.190
And they burned down the bakery
where the wedding cake was being made.

04:25.360 --> 04:28.320
And you think this is funny?
What if they attack us?

04:28.390 --> 04:29.490
No one's attacking us.

04:29.560 --> 04:31.760
And if they do, we'll
have armed escorts.

04:31.830 --> 04:33.460
Dad's father's like a king.

04:33.530 --> 04:36.460
Em, we're royalty over there.

04:36.530 --> 04:39.100
You know, you'll be like Kate Middleton.
Just fat.

04:39.170 --> 04:40.970
Hey, don't talk to
your sister like that.

04:41.040 --> 04:41.770
Come on.

04:41.840 --> 04:43.440
What part of what I
said isn't true?

04:43.510 --> 04:45.540
- Emma...
- Aw, it's cute.

04:45.610 --> 04:47.510
Seriously, can you just
stop with the attitude

04:47.580 --> 04:49.410
and try to appreciate what an
amazing opportunity this is?

04:49.480 --> 04:50.350
Yeah.

04:50.410 --> 04:52.180
It's not just me, you know.

04:52.250 --> 04:54.020
- Dad doesn't want to go either.
- He told you that?

04:54.080 --> 04:55.520
He didn't have to.
Isn't it obvious?

04:55.580 --> 04:58.250
Why do you think he hasn't
been back in 20 years?

04:58.320 --> 05:00.490
He doesn't want to go, and
I don't want to go either.

05:00.560 --> 05:02.160
So I'm not going.

05:02.220 --> 05:04.060
You're going.

05:11.570 --> 05:12.730
That was a long run.

05:12.800 --> 05:14.640
You missed all the fun.

05:14.700 --> 05:16.500
Medical emergency.

05:16.570 --> 05:18.140
Danny Shapiro's got strep.

05:18.210 --> 05:20.440
That's why I don't give out
my cell number to patients.

05:23.510 --> 05:25.580
Sammy, clear your plate.

05:25.615 --> 05:27.580
Got to finish packing.

05:28.330 --> 05:32.000
Honey, you do realize Emma's
manifesting your negativity.

05:32.060 --> 05:35.070
Maybe on the plane ride, you
can think of something nice

05:35.130 --> 05:36.070
to tell her about your family.

05:36.105 --> 05:37.910
They're not my family.
You're my family.

05:37.945 --> 05:39.840
No, see, this is exactly
what I'm talking about.

05:39.890 --> 05:40.790
Of course she's acting out.

05:40.825 --> 05:43.030
All she hears about is how
you don't want to go.

05:43.065 --> 05:44.980
Just promise me we'll come back.

05:45.015 --> 05:46.660
What?

05:49.370 --> 05:52.940
Very funny.

05:57.430 --> 06:00.070
I told you not to take the
405... I mean, come on, who

06:00.140 --> 06:01.400
takes the 405?

06:01.470 --> 06:04.640
All right, let's
go, let's move it.

06:06.510 --> 06:08.480
Come on!

06:15.250 --> 06:18.550
Great. You happy now?

06:18.620 --> 06:19.890
We missed our flight.

06:19.960 --> 06:21.720
I'm sure there's another one.

06:21.790 --> 06:23.690
Or maybe it's a sign
from Allah that we should go

06:23.760 --> 06:26.760
to Disney World like
every other family.

06:26.830 --> 06:28.760
I'll call the airline. See
if there's another flight.

06:28.830 --> 06:31.460
- Mr. Al Fayeed?
- Yes.

06:31.495 --> 06:34.630
- Are you ready to board?
- The plane's still here?

06:34.665 --> 06:35.690
Of course.

06:35.760 --> 06:37.600
I'm sorry. Has
everyone else boarded?

06:37.660 --> 06:40.700
You are the only
passengers, sir.

06:40.770 --> 06:43.770
Your father bought all the
other seats on the plane.

06:47.910 --> 06:51.080
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

06:51.140 --> 06:53.810
Oh, wow.

06:53.880 --> 06:55.750
This is what I'm talking about.

06:57.020 --> 06:58.180
I think I like this.

06:58.215 --> 06:59.110
A whole plane?

06:59.180 --> 07:02.780
Oh, no. No, wait, wait.
All right, this one.

07:02.900 --> 07:04.880
Oh, man. Look at this.

07:04.915 --> 07:06.280
Thank you, Grandpa.

07:06.340 --> 07:08.380
Okay, guys, get up, please.

07:08.450 --> 07:09.850
These aren't our seats.

07:11.180 --> 07:13.050
Y... You're kidding, right?

07:13.120 --> 07:14.320
No, get up.

07:14.390 --> 07:16.790
We're gonna sit in the
seats that we paid for.

07:19.240 --> 07:20.300
Isn't this a little crazy?

07:20.370 --> 07:22.340
This is what's crazy.

07:22.375 --> 07:24.840
I say no to his private
jet, so he does this.

07:24.875 --> 07:27.750
And I'm... I'm not gonna be
manipulated like that.

07:27.785 --> 07:29.150
No way.

07:29.210 --> 07:32.150
Honey, your father'll
never know.

07:34.790 --> 07:36.390
Fine.

07:36.450 --> 07:38.320
Sit wherever you want.

07:47.500 --> 07:49.430
It's okay.

07:49.500 --> 07:51.330
I'll go sit with Dad.

07:51.400 --> 07:52.770
No. Stay here.

08:10.390 --> 08:13.290
I'm in the window seat.

Couple hours.

Mmm.

09:06.840 --> 09:09.640

really happy we're doing this.

Well, I'm happy when you're happy.

09:20.680 --> 09:23.450
See, I see a real
opportunity here.

09:23.520 --> 09:26.460
To finally sit down
with your father.

09:26.520 --> 09:28.290
Tell him everything you've
been carrying around

09:28.360 --> 09:30.430
in your head all these years.

09:32.590 --> 09:36.430
Yeah, you don't know my father.

09:36.500 --> 09:38.430
I know you.

09:38.500 --> 09:40.470
I see you're awake.

09:40.540 --> 09:42.500
Yes.

09:42.570 --> 09:43.640

What's the matter?

No sun in California?

12:57.130 --> 13:01.800
When we went to Disney,
there was plenty of sun.

Molly.

13:21.020 --> 13:23.080
So tall.

13:23.150 --> 13:25.250
I just bought a Mikelson Nomad.

13:25.320 --> 13:26.750
Have you heard of this boat?

13:26.820 --> 13:27.490
No.

13:27.560 --> 13:29.560
Fastest thing
you've ever seen.

13:29.620 --> 13:32.130
After the wedding, we'll take
her out and catch some tuna.

13:32.165 --> 13:33.400
All right.

13:33.435 --> 13:35.000
Come. Let's go to the palace.

13:49.280 --> 13:52.810
Look, Em, there's a Subway.

13:52.880 --> 13:54.950
And I read they just built
a great mall downtown.

13:55.020 --> 13:57.550
It's really not that
different from home.

13:57.620 --> 13:59.590
Except there's no traffic.

13:59.650 --> 14:02.520
They're holding it, stupid.
Because of us.

14:07.530 --> 14:09.460
Sweet.

14:16.790 --> 14:18.890
Check out Grandpa
on the billboard.

14:25.200 --> 14:26.530
You can't kill me!

14:28.370 --> 14:30.170
Here I am!

14:37.310 --> 14:39.380
I'm right here!

14:39.450 --> 14:41.450
You can't kill me!

15:03.970 --> 15:06.910
Holy shit.

15:06.970 --> 15:10.040
You grew up here?

15:11.880 --> 15:13.110
Yeah.

15:13.180 --> 15:15.080
I can't believe you'd ever leave.

15:29.730 --> 15:31.860
I was already at the
airport when you called.

15:31.930 --> 15:34.370
Mm-hmm.

15:36.940 --> 15:38.170
Hello, Bassam.

15:38.240 --> 15:39.070
Leila.

15:40.470 --> 15:43.110
Molly. Welcome.

15:43.170 --> 15:45.540
Congratulations
on the wedding.

15:45.610 --> 15:47.040
You must be so proud.

15:47.110 --> 15:49.280
We are very proud, yes.

15:49.350 --> 15:51.920
And we're so happy you've come.

15:51.980 --> 15:54.950
All of you.

15:55.020 --> 15:57.160
Your father is waiting.

16:00.100 --> 16:03.290
We're fine.
Go ahead.

16:07.940 --> 16:10.270
Who wants to
jump in the pool?

16:10.340 --> 16:13.640
I don't mind.
I... I could do that.

16:52.910 --> 16:55.810
Bassam.

16:57.380 --> 16:59.350
Father.

17:21.109 --> 17:22.910
You look well.

17:22.970 --> 17:24.910
Been so long.

17:26.810 --> 17:29.880
Too long.

17:29.950 --> 17:33.980
Well, um... between, uh,
between work and the kids' schedules,

17:34.050 --> 17:34.950
it's, um...

17:35.020 --> 17:36.520
I'm sure.

17:36.590 --> 17:38.720
You're a busy man.

17:40.120 --> 17:45.630
Your father's been so excited
to see you, he's barely slept.

17:48.130 --> 17:50.430
I need a
moment with Jamal.

17:51.470 --> 17:53.570
Then we'll take a walk.

17:53.640 --> 17:56.640
Just you and me.

18:13.460 --> 18:18.030
Jamal. We just heard from
our sources in Ma'an.

18:18.100 --> 18:21.530
Terrorists are planning
to attack the wedding.

18:21.600 --> 18:24.470
I don't understand.

18:24.530 --> 18:29.100
I told Yussef to pay Walid
to keep them quiet.

18:29.170 --> 18:31.510
Did I ask
you for excuses?

18:35.240 --> 18:38.510
I'll have Ziad round
up the troublemakers.

18:38.580 --> 18:40.120
And tomorrow, 10,000

18:40.180 --> 18:43.220
people will be protesting
in the square.

18:43.290 --> 18:46.820
Don't be a fool, Jamal.

18:46.890 --> 18:49.090
Talk to Walid yourself.

18:49.160 --> 18:52.060
Make sure he understands
there will be consequences

18:52.130 --> 18:55.000
if he can't control
his own people.

18:57.300 --> 18:59.200
And bring your brother.

19:02.240 --> 19:03.570
Why?

19:03.640 --> 19:05.740
Because I told you to.

19:10.510 --> 19:13.210
I wish you'd reconsider.

19:13.280 --> 19:18.190
You're... You're here
for such a short time.

19:18.250 --> 19:21.360
It seems silly for you to
be staying in a hotel.

19:21.420 --> 19:24.190
Well, we, uh, we already
made the... the reservations, so...

19:24.260 --> 19:25.560
Cancel them.

19:25.630 --> 19:31.870
Mother, please, you... You
asked me to come here and I'm here.

19:36.540 --> 19:40.070
He's changed, Bassam.

19:40.140 --> 19:45.610
As hard as that may be for
you to accept, it's true.

19:51.020 --> 19:55.990
How does it feel, being,
uh, home after all these years?

20:00.030 --> 20:03.760
Coming through the city,
I barely recognized the place.

20:03.830 --> 20:06.330
Everything's changed.

20:06.400 --> 20:09.230
Yes, it has.

20:09.300 --> 20:11.640
Saddam and Gaddafi are dead.

20:11.710 --> 20:13.440
Mubarak is on trial.

20:13.510 --> 20:15.940
Ben Ali, in exile.

20:16.010 --> 20:18.910
You're still here.

20:18.980 --> 20:22.810
For now. Inshallah.

20:22.880 --> 20:29.550
After everything I've given the
people, they're still not satisfied.

20:29.620 --> 20:32.160
They say they want freedom.

20:34.160 --> 20:36.130
Freedom.

20:36.200 --> 20:38.000
To do what?

20:38.060 --> 20:40.230
Kill each other?

20:43.500 --> 20:51.610
I give them order and prosperity,
and all they want is chaos.

20:55.380 --> 21:02.350
Listen, um... Molly and the
kids are still waiting for me.

21:02.420 --> 21:05.390
We need to check into the hotel.

21:05.460 --> 21:08.460
Of course.

21:08.530 --> 21:12.660
You didn't come all this way
to hear an old man complain.

21:19.340 --> 21:24.270
It's good to have you
home again, Bassam.

21:24.340 --> 21:28.450
We've been living here for five
years, and as far as we're concerned,

21:28.510 --> 21:30.180
it's paradise, right, baby?

21:30.250 --> 21:31.280
Mm-hmm.

21:31.350 --> 21:33.380
Beaches? Best in the world.

21:33.450 --> 21:37.650
Horses? They've got a racetrack
that blows away Churchill Downs.

21:37.720 --> 21:39.690
We could make a day of it.

21:39.760 --> 21:41.490
Hey, how was it?

21:41.560 --> 21:44.730
Uh, it was good.

21:44.800 --> 21:45.830
John Tucker.

21:45.900 --> 21:47.330
I'm with the embassy.

21:47.400 --> 21:48.700
Nice to finally meet you.

21:48.770 --> 21:49.930
Finally?

21:50.000 --> 21:53.340
Your father talks
about you all the time.

21:53.400 --> 21:54.700
I'm Dana.

21:54.770 --> 21:55.640
I'm with him.

21:55.710 --> 21:57.470
- Hi.
- Hi.

21:57.540 --> 21:59.340
Uh, we should
get to the hotel.

21:59.410 --> 22:01.340
Oh, sure. Okay.

22:01.410 --> 22:03.780
See you at the wedding, right?

22:06.220 --> 22:08.520
Hey, guys, time to go.

22:08.590 --> 22:10.690
Sammy, out of the pool, please.

22:10.725 --> 22:11.720
They're
staying at a hotel?

22:11.790 --> 22:12.850
I just got in!

22:12.920 --> 22:14.290
It's complicated.

22:14.325 --> 22:16.220
So how was it to see your father?

22:16.290 --> 22:19.290
- I told you. It was good.
- It was good?

22:19.360 --> 22:21.230
Yeah, we, um...
we went for a walk.

22:21.300 --> 22:22.400
And?

22:22.460 --> 22:25.530
He got old. I'm not sure
what else you want me to say.

22:25.600 --> 22:29.300
Sammy, get out of the pool.

22:29.370 --> 22:32.340
Sammy, you heard
your father. Let's go.

22:35.410 --> 22:41.280
Oh. Well, this is... this
is so much better than the palace.

22:41.350 --> 22:43.920
Look, a minibar.

22:43.990 --> 22:48.620
You know, I don't really want to go
to this thing tonight. I'm kind of tired.

22:48.660 --> 22:51.190
Aw, come on, Emma. It'll be fun.
We'll get our hands and feet painted.

22:51.260 --> 22:52.960
You always say you
want a tattoo.

22:53.030 --> 22:56.430
Yeah, on my own terms,
not as some creepy patriarchal tradition.

22:56.465 --> 22:57.970
Okay, it's a bachelorette party.

22:58.005 --> 22:59.430
There's nothing
patriarchal about it.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.870
If you're gonna be unbearable,
at least be accurate.

23:01.940 --> 23:04.900
Does that mean our
thing is the bachelor party?

23:04.970 --> 23:06.240
Yeah.

23:06.310 --> 23:08.240
Without the strippers
and the booze.

23:08.310 --> 23:11.410
It's, uh... it's pretty much a
bunch of guys in a steam room

23:11.480 --> 23:13.080
watching the groom get shaved.

23:13.150 --> 23:14.310
Tip the bellboy when he comes.

23:14.380 --> 23:16.920
I'll see you in the lobby at 6:00.

23:16.980 --> 23:19.350
Hating.

23:23.560 --> 23:26.230
Bunch of guys
in a steam room.

23:26.290 --> 23:28.890
Bummer.

23:28.960 --> 23:30.900
You better be careful.

23:30.960 --> 23:32.200
This isn't America.

23:32.270 --> 23:34.870
Thanks, Mom.

23:47.210 --> 23:48.810
See?

23:48.880 --> 23:50.280
It's pretty.

23:53.550 --> 23:55.520
She says it's your turn.

23:55.590 --> 23:57.690
Oh, that's okay.
I'm good.

23:57.760 --> 24:01.290
Go ahead. It doesn't hurt.

24:07.430 --> 24:12.140
So tell me, how did you
finally convince Bassam to come?

24:12.200 --> 24:16.270
I told him it's crazy,
we've been married for 19 years

24:16.340 --> 24:18.410
and I've never seen
where he's from.

24:18.480 --> 24:21.380
He doesn't like to talk
about his childhood much.

24:21.450 --> 24:26.420
I thought by coming here, maybe...

24:26.480 --> 24:30.820
Bassam has always
been a very private person.

24:35.630 --> 24:38.930
Remember, Sammy, the whole
time we were catching fish

24:39.000 --> 24:42.270
and your father was standing
over the railing and...

24:46.840 --> 24:49.040
Like it?

24:49.110 --> 24:51.340
Good, huh?

24:55.280 --> 24:58.380
Bassam, come with me.

25:16.600 --> 25:18.030
Where are we going?

25:18.100 --> 25:20.400
To talk to a
tribal leader from Ma'an,

25:20.470 --> 25:22.670
which is still the
asshole of the country.

25:22.740 --> 25:25.240
Yussef paid him to keep things
quiet during the wedding,

25:25.310 --> 25:26.310
but it didn't work.

25:26.380 --> 25:28.540
And now I have to handle it.

25:28.610 --> 25:31.510
What do you
mean it didn't work?

25:31.580 --> 25:35.180
Walid's terrorist nephew,
Ihab, he's been causing

25:35.215 --> 25:38.920
trouble ever since he
came back from Syria.

25:38.990 --> 25:42.020
Now he's threatening to
blow up the wedding.

25:42.090 --> 25:45.230
Blow up the wedding? Jamal, I
brought my whole family here.

25:45.265 --> 25:47.030
No worries, Bassam.

25:47.100 --> 25:48.030
I'll handle it.

25:48.100 --> 25:51.000
My friend, the minute I
heard you wanted to see me,

25:51.070 --> 25:52.670
I dropped everything
and came here.

25:52.730 --> 25:56.170
You didn't come,
Walid, my men brought you.

25:56.240 --> 25:58.210
And here I am.

25:58.270 --> 26:01.040
My father is troubled
by what he's been hearing

26:01.110 --> 26:03.640
about your terrorist
nephew, Ihab.

26:03.710 --> 26:06.280
People are always
spreading rumors about Ihab.

26:06.350 --> 26:12.050
So he has no plans to
blow up my son's wedding?

26:14.820 --> 26:17.090
N... Not that I've heard.

26:17.160 --> 26:20.560
But you don't
know for sure.

26:20.630 --> 26:22.730
Well, look, it's true
that Ihab doesn't share my

26:22.800 --> 26:26.200
- goodwill for your son's wedding...
- I pay you to control him.

26:26.270 --> 26:27.330
I can only
do what I can do.

26:27.365 --> 26:30.240
- I... I tried talking to him...
- Not hard enough.

26:30.300 --> 26:31.870
No!

26:47.350 --> 26:48.760
Jamal! Please!

26:48.820 --> 26:52.320
You think you can take our money?
Well, you...

26:52.380 --> 26:53.490
Jamal.

26:53.520 --> 26:55.600
I'll take your
fingers one at a time.

26:57.295 --> 26:58.100
Jamal! Stop!

26:58.160 --> 26:59.270
Stop! Stop it!

27:01.170 --> 27:02.130
Get off!

27:02.200 --> 27:03.170
Listen to me!

27:03.240 --> 27:06.270
You're giving him more reason
to attack than he already has.

27:06.340 --> 27:08.310
You don't
understand, Bassam.

27:08.380 --> 27:11.740
You've been gone too long.

27:11.810 --> 27:15.110
This asshole and his nephew need
to learn there are consequences.

27:15.180 --> 27:17.150
Okay, but not like this.

27:17.220 --> 27:18.520
Then how? Tell me.

27:18.580 --> 27:19.380
I'm listening.

27:23.220 --> 27:26.090
Talk to him.

27:26.160 --> 27:27.530
Talk to him?

27:27.590 --> 27:29.060
You mean like Oprah.

27:29.130 --> 27:30.400
"How do you feel, Walid?

27:30.460 --> 27:31.730
You had a bad childhood?

27:31.800 --> 27:33.400
Oh, me, too. Let's hug it out."

27:33.470 --> 27:36.400
- No, that's not what I mean.
- Then what do you mean?

27:36.470 --> 27:38.200
Invite him
to the wedding.

27:38.270 --> 27:40.640
Him and his nephew, Ihab.

27:40.710 --> 27:44.340
Invite his whole family and put one
of them at every single table.

27:44.410 --> 27:47.040
He'll find a way to make
sure no one attacks.

28:09.470 --> 28:15.670
My brother Bassam would
like you and your family

28:15.740 --> 28:19.580
to come to the wedding
as his honored guests.

30:33.500 --> 30:35.430
Bassam.

30:35.500 --> 30:38.540
What the hell are
you doing here?

30:46.480 --> 30:48.610
She's beautiful.

30:48.680 --> 30:51.080
Looks just like her mom.

30:51.150 --> 30:53.220
Thank you.

30:53.280 --> 30:55.790
She's very intelligent.

30:58.790 --> 31:02.860
So how come
you never called me back?

31:04.730 --> 31:08.600
Do you have any idea
what's happening here, Bassam?

31:08.670 --> 31:12.170
I read what you write,
if that's what you're asking.

31:13.540 --> 31:16.510
After the protests
started last year,

31:16.570 --> 31:19.510
your father sent his
tanks into Ma'an.

31:19.580 --> 31:22.340
Dozens of people were
killed, hundreds wounded.

31:22.410 --> 31:26.540
All the international web sites
and papers carried my articles,

31:26.580 --> 31:28.590
yet I never heard
anything from you.

31:28.620 --> 31:31.490
- Well, we never talk about politics.
- 'Cause you don't want to.

31:36.530 --> 31:40.500
If there was ever a time
to come back, it was then.

31:40.560 --> 31:44.370
Instead, you come
back for a wedding.

31:44.430 --> 31:48.570
A wedding that's
costing ã10 million.

31:53.140 --> 31:55.840
Your father claims that he's
defending us from the infidels,

31:55.910 --> 32:00.310
the Brotherhood and the Zionists,
while the people in Ma'an go hungry.

32:00.380 --> 32:01.920
Come on, you know how
corrupt they are there.

32:01.980 --> 32:03.750
My father is not the
only one to blame.

32:03.820 --> 32:06.050
Of course
you're defending him.

32:06.120 --> 32:08.260
Fauzi, what
do you want from me?

32:08.320 --> 32:10.890
- I... I'm a pediatrician.
- You're an Al Fayeed.

32:10.960 --> 32:12.860
They are your family.

32:12.930 --> 32:14.860
Yes.

32:14.930 --> 32:17.500
That's why I left.

32:19.830 --> 32:22.870
After I wrote
about the protests,

32:22.940 --> 32:25.840
<i>the mukhabar took me in
the middle of the night</i>

32:25.910 --> 32:29.810
and kept me in prison
for three days.

32:29.880 --> 32:36.280
While you're living your American
dream, I dream about this.

32:45.930 --> 32:50.060
I'm sorry if I interfered
with your nostalgia, Bassam.

32:53.500 --> 32:56.500
You should finish your tea.

32:56.570 --> 32:58.710
I have a deadline.

32:58.770 --> 33:01.270
And you have a wedding.

33:33.040 --> 33:35.870
It's a little over
the top, don't you think?

33:35.940 --> 33:37.580
Are you kidding?

33:37.640 --> 33:41.950
Barry... people can see these
fireworks from 20 miles away.

33:42.010 --> 33:45.920
The fireworks are the
key to the whole thing.

33:45.990 --> 33:50.520
Forget those pricks
from Amnesty.

33:50.590 --> 33:53.020
What your father's done
here is a miracle.

33:53.090 --> 33:55.930
Not counting the Saudis, the
mean per capita income's

33:55.990 --> 34:01.030
18% higher here than any other
country in the Arab League.

34:01.100 --> 34:04.270
Syria, Egypt... firefights.

34:04.340 --> 34:05.940
Here... fireworks.

34:07.010 --> 34:08.670
Me, I'll take fireworks.

34:24.989 --> 34:27.889
My name's Sammy, by the way.

34:27.960 --> 34:30.290
I know who you are.

34:30.360 --> 34:32.130
Abdul.

34:34.199 --> 34:38.770
So, what's your connection?

34:38.840 --> 34:42.100
My father runs security
for your grandfather.

34:43.440 --> 34:47.510
My grandfather was the head of
security for your great-grandfather.

34:47.580 --> 34:49.980
And my great-grandfather
was the head of security

34:50.050 --> 34:52.350
- for your great-great...
- I get it.

34:54.750 --> 34:57.520
I was just making sure
we're not related.

35:01.220 --> 35:03.630
Whoa-ho-ho!

35:03.690 --> 35:07.060
There he is! My man... Walid!

35:07.130 --> 35:09.870
It's good you are here.

35:09.930 --> 35:13.530
May Allah keep the bride and
groom in prosperity, and confer

35:13.600 --> 35:15.570
his blessings upon them.

35:15.640 --> 35:17.640
Do you know my
uncle, General Tariq?

35:17.710 --> 35:20.410
Good to see you,
as always, General.

35:20.480 --> 35:23.040
And you both know
my wife, Nadia.

35:23.110 --> 35:25.850
- And my nephew...
- Ihab.

35:25.910 --> 35:27.980
Did you enjoy the fireworks?

35:28.050 --> 35:29.820
Of course.

35:29.890 --> 35:32.090
Who doesn't enjoy fireworks?

35:32.150 --> 35:34.990
Boom, boom, boom.

36:19.130 --> 36:21.300
Bassam!

36:21.370 --> 36:23.070
Come!

36:23.140 --> 36:24.700
Let's go.

36:24.770 --> 36:26.200
No, no, I'm... I'm good.

36:26.270 --> 36:30.540
Hey. You've come all
this way after 20 years.

36:30.610 --> 36:33.380
Go on.

36:41.350 --> 36:44.060
You were right.

36:44.120 --> 36:45.060
About what?

36:45.120 --> 36:46.990
No attacks.

36:47.060 --> 36:52.000
Look at Walid and his terrorist
nephew, standing like scarecrows.

36:54.530 --> 36:56.500
It's because of you.

36:56.570 --> 36:58.600
You did this.

37:33.940 --> 37:35.810
Wait! Wait! Wait!

37:35.870 --> 37:37.980
Take him. Take him.

37:38.040 --> 37:39.280
Jamal.

37:39.340 --> 37:41.950
Jamal... come out here.

37:42.980 --> 37:45.150
Come here.

37:45.220 --> 37:47.280
Come out here, Jamal.

37:48.890 --> 37:50.090
Come out here.

37:50.150 --> 37:54.160
Sometimes you have to make hard
choices to be a good leader.

37:54.230 --> 37:56.860
These are the people who
shelter these dogs,

37:56.930 --> 37:59.060
these traitors who tried to kill us.
Give me this.

37:59.130 --> 38:00.800
Take this. Do it.

38:02.200 --> 38:03.700
Do it, Jamal.

38:03.770 --> 38:05.000
Please. I have a family.

38:10.370 --> 38:13.280
Your turn.

38:58.020 --> 38:59.820
Uh, excuse me.

39:04.330 --> 39:06.090
Where are you going?

39:06.160 --> 39:08.230
Uh, just, uh, just,
uh, getting some air.

39:08.300 --> 39:10.300
You were just on the
dance floor with your brother.

39:10.360 --> 39:11.230
What happened?

39:11.300 --> 39:13.250
It doesn't matter.

39:13.290 --> 39:16.200
Barry, please stop
telling me it doesn't matter.

39:47.970 --> 39:51.300
He's a good
boy, my Ahmed.

39:51.370 --> 39:53.470
You love him?

39:55.380 --> 39:57.940
That's good. Good.

40:01.210 --> 40:07.820
A girl this beautiful, I'm
sure you had many suitors.

40:12.060 --> 40:14.860
The wedding night
is very special.

40:16.230 --> 40:19.230
It's important to be pure.

40:20.970 --> 40:26.600
It would break Ahmed's heart if
the woman he married wasn't pure.

40:39.290 --> 40:41.220
There.

40:41.290 --> 40:43.490
There it is.

40:47.530 --> 40:49.290
Good girl.

40:53.270 --> 40:55.530
Good girl.

41:04.410 --> 41:08.040
I'm beginning
to think he's insane.

41:08.110 --> 41:13.120
The thing is, I don't even...
blame Jamal.

41:13.180 --> 41:15.390
I blame our father.

41:15.450 --> 41:18.360
The reason that Jamal is so

41:18.420 --> 41:20.260
broken is because...

41:20.320 --> 41:22.960
my father broke him.

41:23.030 --> 41:25.060
That's what he does.

41:25.130 --> 41:26.900
And...

41:28.430 --> 41:29.830
I'm sorry, I...

41:29.900 --> 41:32.040
I don't want
to dump all this on you.

41:32.100 --> 41:33.400
No. This is good.

41:33.470 --> 41:35.840
It's good that you did.

41:35.910 --> 41:37.870
Now, you need to
tell your father.

41:37.940 --> 41:39.880
- Tell him what?
- Everything.

41:39.940 --> 41:41.880
That's not gonna
change anything.

41:41.950 --> 41:43.880
It's certainly not
gonna change him.

41:43.950 --> 41:46.880
I'm not asking you to do it
for him, I'm asking you to do it

41:46.950 --> 41:49.220
for you. For us.

41:49.290 --> 41:50.190
Us?

41:50.250 --> 41:54.160
Barry... you ran away from
your father when you were 16,

41:54.220 --> 41:55.920
and you're still running.

41:55.990 --> 41:58.430
Since I've known you,
you've been carrying around

41:58.490 --> 42:02.260
this weight that's just
gotten heavier, and...

42:02.330 --> 42:05.400
it's left you... joyless.

42:05.470 --> 42:08.440
I don't know how else to say it.

42:08.500 --> 42:11.410
And if you think that hasn't
affected your relationship

42:11.470 --> 42:13.780
with Emma and Sammy...

42:13.840 --> 42:15.780
with me...

42:19.480 --> 42:20.620
Bassam.

42:21.550 --> 42:24.350
It's your father.

42:24.420 --> 42:26.020
He's collapsed.

42:38.680 --> 42:45.680
I am afraid the president has
suffered a cerebrovascular injury.

42:45.750 --> 42:47.680
What does that mean?

42:47.750 --> 42:49.290
It means a stroke.

42:49.350 --> 42:50.820
Yes.

42:50.890 --> 42:52.720
He'll be fine.

42:52.790 --> 42:54.990
We are doing everything we can.

42:55.060 --> 42:58.060
If he dies, you die.

42:58.130 --> 43:01.100
You are a doctor; you fix him.

43:06.240 --> 43:08.370
Your father asked to see you.

43:20.820 --> 43:24.890
My son will cut the ribbon.

43:29.830 --> 43:30.990
I'm right here!

43:31.060 --> 43:33.230
You can't kill me!

43:38.400 --> 43:39.470
Bassam...

43:45.880 --> 43:47.310
Bassam...

43:48.840 --> 43:51.610
It's okay.

43:51.680 --> 43:52.680
Don't try to talk.

43:52.715 --> 43:55.320
Listen to me.

43:55.380 --> 44:01.660
Without you, they'll
kill us all.

44:08.060 --> 44:10.200
I was wrong.

44:14.870 --> 44:17.210
It should have been you.

44:22.380 --> 44:25.350
It should have been you, Bassam.

44:40.430 --> 44:41.790
How is he?

44:41.860 --> 44:43.000
What did he say?

44:43.060 --> 44:47.530
He wants to talk to you.
You and Mother.

44:56.940 --> 44:59.050
You okay?

45:02.920 --> 45:05.080
Barry?

45:05.150 --> 45:08.790
You should
check on the kids.

45:08.860 --> 45:10.960
Okay.

45:37.880 --> 45:39.380
He's gone.

45:43.390 --> 45:45.120
He's gone.

45:45.190 --> 45:46.490
Jamal.

45:46.560 --> 45:47.830
Jamal, come...

45:47.890 --> 45:49.230
Where are you going?

45:49.300 --> 45:52.560
Look at me. Look at me.

45:52.630 --> 45:54.930
Now you are in charge.

45:55.000 --> 45:56.800
Okay?

45:56.870 --> 45:59.900
Now it's your time.

45:59.970 --> 46:02.070
You need to be a man.

46:03.340 --> 46:05.340
You're telling
me to be a man?

46:05.410 --> 46:08.510
When was the last time
you were a woman to me?

46:08.580 --> 46:10.610
Oh!

46:10.680 --> 46:11.620
Stop it.

46:11.655 --> 46:12.880
You hate me.

46:12.950 --> 46:14.120
I know that.

46:14.190 --> 46:15.620
I love you.

46:15.690 --> 46:16.650
And you hate me.

46:16.720 --> 46:18.920
This is... Jamal.

46:18.990 --> 46:21.060
Jamal.

46:21.130 --> 46:23.260
Jamal!

46:39.140 --> 46:42.680
President Khaled Al Fayeed's condition
is still unknown at this time.

46:42.750 --> 46:44.880
No official word from the
presidential palace.

46:44.950 --> 46:47.520
The president collapsed at his
grandson's wedding celebration

46:47.580 --> 46:49.620
five hours ago.

46:49.690 --> 46:51.820
He's dead.

46:51.890 --> 46:55.090
I'm so sorry.

47:04.170 --> 47:05.670
Come on. Let's go.

47:05.740 --> 47:07.800
Okay.
Back to the hotel?

47:07.870 --> 47:10.730
- To the airport.
- What...?

47:10.765 --> 47:12.710
- We're leaving.
- What are you talking about?

47:12.780 --> 47:13.680
We're going home.

47:13.740 --> 47:14.640
Barry.

47:14.710 --> 47:16.900
- We can't just leave.
- Come on. Get up.

47:16.930 --> 47:18.610
Honey, we don't
have our passports.

47:18.640 --> 47:19.750
That's fine.
We'll stop at the hotel.

47:20.120 --> 47:22.580
Get up, Sammy. Now.

47:22.650 --> 47:26.490
So, what, we're not even
staying for Grandpa's funeral?

47:26.560 --> 47:29.580
Sammy, for once,
you do what I tell you.

47:29.620 --> 47:30.840
I want to
see Uncle Jamal.

47:30.880 --> 47:32.030
No, I said we're going now.

47:32.090 --> 47:33.060
Sammy, listen to Dad.

47:33.130 --> 47:35.000
I'm not leaving here
until I see Uncle Jamal.

47:35.035 --> 47:36.200
Forget Uncle Jamal.

47:36.260 --> 47:37.300
No.

47:37.370 --> 47:38.770
I'm staying here.

47:48.210 --> 47:49.440
Now.

47:57.650 --> 47:59.950
What is the
matter with you?

48:28.500 --> 48:30.600
Meet me downstairs.

48:56.090 --> 48:58.890
I need four seats on the
next flight to Los Angeles.

48:58.960 --> 49:00.330
In coach, please.

49:00.390 --> 49:01.330
Any airline?

49:01.390 --> 49:02.430
Yeah.

49:02.500 --> 49:05.000
Passports.
Come on.

49:38.500 --> 49:43.470
What are you looking at?

49:43.530 --> 49:46.000
You want to look at something?

49:46.070 --> 49:47.240
Look at this.

49:47.310 --> 49:49.570
Look at this. Come on.

49:50.840 --> 49:51.880
Yeah.

49:51.940 --> 49:53.610
Mmm.

49:55.750 --> 49:56.450
Yeah.

49:58.120 --> 50:00.550
Good girl.

50:08.030 --> 50:09.090
That's good.

50:11.230 --> 50:12.630
Oh, yeah.

50:14.300 --> 50:15.200
What is this?

50:56.710 --> 50:59.640
And once we've reached an
altitude of 10,000 feet,

50:59.710 --> 51:03.280
you'll be able to use all
approved electronic devices.

51:11.850 --> 51:15.020
Okay, we're on the plane.

51:15.090 --> 51:17.090
We're going home.

51:17.160 --> 51:21.400
Are you ready to explain
to me what that was about?

51:21.460 --> 51:24.400
- Barry.
- Not now.

51:24.440 --> 51:26.400
Oh, what do
you mean, not now?

51:26.470 --> 51:29.300
You leave without saying
good-bye to your family

51:29.370 --> 51:32.610
- after your father dies. I'm...
- They're not my family.

51:32.670 --> 51:35.610
You hit our son.

51:35.680 --> 51:37.610
Molly, not now.

51:37.680 --> 51:41.210
No. I'm sick of it.

51:41.280 --> 51:43.620
I never know what
you're thinking.

51:43.680 --> 51:45.950
I never know how you feel
because you never tell me.

51:47.420 --> 51:49.460
We've been married for 19 years.

51:49.520 --> 51:52.190
And you force me to be like
some kind of a mind reader.

51:52.260 --> 51:55.330
Please, look at me.

51:55.400 --> 51:59.330
I feel like I don't know
who you are anymore.

51:59.400 --> 52:00.970
I'm not sure I ever did.

52:04.640 --> 52:05.600
Please.

52:05.670 --> 52:06.410
Do it.

52:06.470 --> 52:07.110
Please.

52:07.170 --> 52:08.070
Shoot him.

52:08.105 --> 52:11.280
I have a family, please, no, please.

52:11.315 --> 52:13.110
Do it, Jamal.

52:13.145 --> 52:14.080
Please, no.

52:17.550 --> 52:18.820
Jamal.

52:18.880 --> 52:21.050
Jamal!

52:25.160 --> 52:26.690
Come back here.

52:29.730 --> 52:32.000
Jamal.

52:32.060 --> 52:34.830
Get out right now.

52:36.500 --> 52:38.540
Get out.

52:53.990 --> 52:57.820
Right now... get out of the car.

52:57.890 --> 53:01.090
- Jamal, do as I say.
- No, please, please.

53:01.160 --> 53:03.090
Get out of
the car, Jamal.

53:03.160 --> 53:05.830
Out of the car!

53:05.900 --> 53:06.660
Get out, Jamal!

53:06.730 --> 53:07.700
No, no, no.

53:07.770 --> 53:12.340
Oh!

53:18.240 --> 53:22.310
It should have
been you, Bassam.

53:23.950 --> 53:27.120
I mean it, Barry.

53:27.180 --> 53:29.750
I can't do this anymore.

53:29.820 --> 53:35.460
If you don't tell me what's going
on, I don't know what I'm gonna do.

53:35.530 --> 53:38.590
I don't know what
we're gonna do.

53:40.660 --> 53:43.300
Hello, this is your
captain speaking.

53:43.360 --> 53:46.200
Um, sorry for the delay,
but the tower has asked us

53:46.260 --> 53:48.660
to sit tight for a few minutes.

54:10.230 --> 54:12.430
Mr. Al Fayeed?

54:25.750 --> 54:27.740
I told you we
shouldn't have come.
