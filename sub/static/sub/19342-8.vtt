00:09.333 --> 00:12.583
Danny fucking Margolis.
What brings you back?

00:12.583 --> 00:13.583
I have some ideas,

00:13.583 --> 00:15.500
and I'd love
to share them with you.

00:15.500 --> 00:16.708
Did you hear it okay?

00:16.708 --> 00:19.250
Hello.
I'm Taylor.

00:19.250 --> 00:21.291
My pronouns are they,
theirs, and them.

00:21.291 --> 00:23.875
-How long you been here?
-I'm an intern.

00:23.875 --> 00:27.250
Just breathing the air here
can be discomforting.

00:27.250 --> 00:29.333
The air is thinner.

00:31.041 --> 00:34.125
That is a picture of a man
running for office.

00:34.125 --> 00:36.959
Which mansion will it be,
Gracie or the Governor's?

00:36.959 --> 00:38.250
Relax, dad.

00:38.250 --> 00:40.083
You need some personal time
with Black Jack Foley.

00:40.083 --> 00:42.708
You must be talking
about Sandicot.

00:42.708 --> 00:45.041
The proposed
location of a casino.

00:45.041 --> 00:47.041
- Does it have to go there?
- If the town defaults,

00:47.041 --> 00:49.834
I know
what you stand to lose.

00:49.834 --> 00:52.250
You need that casino as soon
as goddamned possible.

Go, do whatever the fuck
you want, and so will I.

00:54.792 --> 00:55.875
You want the freedom
to see other people.

00:55.875 --> 00:58.583
Consider that door open.

00:59.041 --> 01:00.959
I am committed

01:00.959 --> 01:03.208
to complete transparency
between us.

01:03.208 --> 01:07.667
So you can either quit
right now... or you can stay.

01:07.667 --> 01:10.208
Sandicot's not getting
the gaming license. It's over.

01:10.208 --> 01:12.959
So, why would Foley
want to fuck me?

01:12.959 --> 01:15.625
The committee chose
the location

01:15.625 --> 01:17.208
that would bring
the greatest benefit to

01:17.208 --> 01:19.375

01:19.375 --> 01:22.083
What do you know
about Sandicot?

01:22.083 --> 01:23.375
Go ahead, seize their assets.

01:23.375 --> 01:25.291
- What kind of assets?
- Sandicot also has

01:25.291 --> 01:27.542
- an original Remington.
- The fuck's a Remington?

01:27.542 --> 01:29.917

to hurt all of these people

01:33.417 --> 01:34.583

And then we go in with charter
schools and outreach,

we capture the tax write-off,

01:42.375 --> 01:45.000
and those kids will be better
off than their parents,

01:45.000 --> 01:45.625

Look, I know why  is among
the more tantalizing questions,

11:13.875 --> 11:15.583
Back to chasing ambulances,
Chuck?

11:15.583 --> 11:17.417
Bobby boy.

11:17.417 --> 11:20.333
All wrapping wounds

11:20.333 --> 11:24.333
and pressing flesh,
or have you got a minute?

11:24.333 --> 11:27.417
The state has
a lieutenant governor, an AG,

11:27.417 --> 11:29.875
influential
university presidents.

11:29.875 --> 11:30.959
All are a tick or two
ahead of you.

11:30.959 --> 11:33.500
And some of them,
Hell, maybe all  of them,

11:33.500 --> 11:35.708
are gonna get
in this thing.

11:35.708 --> 11:37.291
Foley thought
you were the one

11:37.291 --> 11:38.875
that would cede
the most control.

11:38.875 --> 11:42.333
A few months from now,
when you and all those others

11:42.333 --> 11:44.291
are in the gubernatorial
scrum,

11:44.291 --> 11:48.250
churning, gasping,

11:48.250 --> 11:50.708
drowning on dry land,

11:50.708 --> 11:51.959
you know where I'll be?

11:51.959 --> 11:55.291
Sitting in the corner,
watching, jerking off.

11:57.208 --> 11:58.834
Gliding above you.

11:58.834 --> 12:01.500
Sailing straight
into every debate.

12:01.500 --> 12:03.417
A mainstay
of every conversation.

12:03.417 --> 12:04.917
You've been polling.

12:04.917 --> 12:09.208
No, but I've seen numbers.
They're encouraging.

12:09.208 --> 12:10.875
I bet you've seen
the same numbers.

12:10.875 --> 12:12.708
I know which end
of the poll is up.

12:12.708 --> 12:15.250
Mm-hmm.
So then you know

12:15.250 --> 12:17.875
that there are some areas
where I could use some help.

12:19.542 --> 12:22.208
-Upstate.
-Your backyard.

12:22.208 --> 12:23.208
Oh, shit.

12:23.208 --> 12:27.041
You want me to be
your lieutenant governor.

12:27.041 --> 12:29.792
Come on,
I'm here with you.

12:29.792 --> 12:34.083
Man to man,
sketching the way forward.

12:34.083 --> 12:36.333
You know,
I have won the lowliest

12:36.333 --> 12:38.458
fucking elected offices
we've got.

12:38.458 --> 12:39.375
Hell, I was the goddamned

12:39.375 --> 12:41.583
sanitation commissioner
for a year.

12:41.583 --> 12:43.375
Yeah,
and I rode the trucks.

12:43.375 --> 12:45.959
I've done it right.
I've done it hard.

12:45.959 --> 12:48.792
And this...
this is my time.

12:48.792 --> 12:53.834
My name recognition
is eight times yours.

12:55.083 --> 12:57.750
Don't underestimate
Black Jack Foley... or me.

12:57.750 --> 13:00.583
And name recognition
means dick.

13:00.583 --> 13:02.083
Nobody knew
George Pataki's name,

13:02.083 --> 13:04.417
and then they elected him
three times, Chuck.

13:04.417 --> 13:06.542
So when I've been governor
for 12 years,

13:06.542 --> 13:08.750
they'll know
my fucking name.

13:08.750 --> 13:09.917
♪ suspenseful music  ♪

13:27.875 --> 13:30.166
-This is insubordinate.
-Oh?

13:30.166 --> 13:32.792
And what would you call
snaking someone else's lead?

13:32.792 --> 13:34.708
Don't say
you were protecting me.

13:34.708 --> 13:36.542
Protecting you?

13:36.542 --> 13:37.750
This is the kind of shit
that made me--

13:37.750 --> 13:41.291
What,
like me or dump me?

13:41.291 --> 13:42.834
Both.

13:45.041 --> 13:46.792
Well, since we're here...

13:51.208 --> 13:52.291
We can wait out here
till they're done.

13:52.291 --> 13:54.834
Yeah.

13:56.291 --> 13:58.291
I'm offering
to buy your product.

13:58.291 --> 13:59.166
I'm offering to buy
the product

13:59.166 --> 14:00.583
from all seven
of your scrap yards

14:00.583 --> 14:03.458
at a considerable premium.

14:03.458 --> 14:05.000
And you're saying no?

14:05.000 --> 14:07.083
I'm saying I already
have a buyer.

14:07.083 --> 14:09.500
You didn't take this meeting
to tell me no.

14:09.500 --> 14:10.834
Actually, I did.

14:10.834 --> 14:14.250
But to tell you no nicely.

14:14.250 --> 14:16.083
I don't know what's going on
between you and Foley,

14:16.083 --> 14:18.917
but I know it's enough that
you're taking aim on him,

14:18.917 --> 14:20.875
and I don't want
to do you disrespect

14:20.875 --> 14:23.792
because I don't want you
taking aim on me.

14:23.792 --> 14:25.959
Okay,
I'm gonna skip the part

14:25.959 --> 14:27.500
where I say, "Who's Foley?"

14:27.500 --> 14:29.500
or, "What does he have to do
with this?"

14:29.500 --> 14:32.125
I'm gonna go straight
to doubling the offer.

14:32.125 --> 14:36.166
370 percent
of what you normally make.

14:36.166 --> 14:37.041
I'm basically
extorting myself.

14:37.041 --> 14:39.458
And I wish I could
take advantage,

14:39.458 --> 14:40.917
but this isn't
a negotiation.

14:40.917 --> 14:43.417
-There's no magic number.
-There's always a number.

14:43.417 --> 14:45.875
Not in this case.
I do business in this state.

14:45.875 --> 14:47.208
I live in this state.

14:47.208 --> 14:49.583
Foley could make
both of those more unpleasant

14:49.583 --> 14:51.542
than six hours
on the cross at Calvary.

14:51.542 --> 14:52.375
I get out of bed
one morning

14:52.375 --> 14:54.542
and find overnight
I'm jammed up

14:54.542 --> 14:56.083
with licenses
and unions and taxes

14:56.083 --> 14:56.875
and he's found
a dozen other ways

14:56.875 --> 14:59.750
to hurt me
I didn't see coming.

15:01.583 --> 15:03.166
I thank you
for your offer.

15:04.750 --> 15:07.375
Hopefully we part
on good terms,

15:07.375 --> 15:09.750
but if not...

15:09.750 --> 15:11.417
♪ suspenseful music  ♪

15:11.417 --> 15:14.458
You're more afraid of him
than you are of me.

15:24.291 --> 15:25.792
A billion dollars.

15:25.792 --> 15:28.834
Are you offering me that?

15:28.834 --> 15:31.875
No.
I'm not fucking insane.

15:31.875 --> 15:34.750
But you would have taken it.

15:37.625 --> 15:39.375
I do something
that's valuable.

15:39.375 --> 15:42.083
I strip people naked
to the elements,

15:42.083 --> 15:44.750
and then I help rebuild them
out of solid fucking rock.

15:44.750 --> 15:47.708
-Now, can you appreciate that?
-I can.

15:47.708 --> 15:50.375
Nope.
Don't believe you.

15:50.375 --> 15:51.250
Because if you did,

15:51.250 --> 15:55.166
you wouldn't be asking me
to snitch.

15:55.166 --> 15:58.375
Axelrod banished you.

15:58.375 --> 15:58.834
He made you a ronin.

16:01.083 --> 16:03.792
I'm willing to bet he didn't
give it a moment's thought,

16:03.792 --> 16:06.834
while you've been thinking about
it every second of the day,

16:06.834 --> 16:09.875
suffering from something
you've never felt before.

16:09.875 --> 16:11.291
Doubt.

16:11.291 --> 16:14.083
And all because
you pledged yourself

16:14.083 --> 16:17.166
to an unworthy lord.

16:17.166 --> 16:20.250
Axelrod lacks five of the eight
virtues of the Bushido.

16:27.417 --> 16:30.291
Six.

16:30.291 --> 16:32.667
Oftentimes,
he wasn't even polite.

16:32.667 --> 16:36.083
Under these circumstances,

16:36.083 --> 16:37.792
honor doesn't demand
silence or self-harm.

16:37.792 --> 16:40.125
It demands vengeance.

16:51.375 --> 16:55.041
I can't deliver
that vengeance.

16:55.041 --> 16:57.333
I didn't have that much
one-on-one time with Axe.

16:57.333 --> 16:59.500
He was used to flirting
with Wendy Rhoades.

16:59.500 --> 17:03.000
I offered a different
kind of medicine.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.083
So I didn't have access

17:06.083 --> 17:09.708
to the kind of conversations
that you're interested in.

17:12.458 --> 17:16.000
But I know who did.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.583
His chief of staff.

17:17.583 --> 17:19.750
Steph Reed.
That's her name.

17:19.750 --> 17:22.417
She was in on every pitch,

17:22.417 --> 17:25.917
and she doesn't work there
anymore, either.

17:27.375 --> 17:30.542
-Taylor, right?
-Right.

17:36.500 --> 17:38.166
How can I help you?

17:38.166 --> 17:41.583
I have to tell you, I've had
927 hours of therapy.

17:42.542 --> 17:45.708
So you've seen cognitive,
humanistic,

17:45.708 --> 17:48.750
probably some holistic.

17:48.750 --> 17:50.375
What do you think you need?

17:50.375 --> 17:53.875
I need to know...

17:53.875 --> 17:56.792
Mafee.
He's struggling.

17:56.792 --> 17:59.917
He's our executing trader.
He needs to be "on." He's not.

17:59.917 --> 18:02.208
And his fall-off coincided
with my advancement,

18:02.208 --> 18:04.333
which makes me...

18:04.333 --> 18:05.583
I was his intern.

18:05.583 --> 18:08.000
He could have taken credit
for my work. He didn't.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.917
So now you're feeling
guilty.

18:11.917 --> 18:14.291
And you're wondering
if that's healthy?

18:14.291 --> 18:16.583
More than that.

18:16.583 --> 18:19.125
I want to know
if it's useful.

18:19.125 --> 18:21.750
Do you care about

18:21.750 --> 18:23.375
your relationships at Axe Cap?

18:27.000 --> 18:30.333
How are those relationships?

18:30.333 --> 18:32.250
Good.

18:34.667 --> 18:36.750
-Why do you think that is?
-I know why.

18:36.750 --> 18:38.875
Because the culture
is set from the top.

18:38.875 --> 18:41.792
Since Axe likes me,
other people do, or pretend to.

18:41.792 --> 18:44.333
Why do you think
he likes you?

18:44.333 --> 18:47.333
One of the two reasons
anyone likes anyone else.

18:47.333 --> 18:50.417
Either they recognize
a part of themselves,

18:50.417 --> 18:52.875
or they see
something they can use.

18:52.875 --> 18:54.291
In this case,
I imagine it's both.

18:54.291 --> 18:57.625
There's another reason
people like each other.

18:57.625 --> 18:59.583
They see something
they're lacking,

18:59.583 --> 19:01.417
and they want to be near it.

19:01.417 --> 19:03.125
Is that what's between
the two of you?

19:03.125 --> 19:08.500
I've noticed a... connection.

19:11.625 --> 19:14.291
Everyone always just assumes
we were fucking.

19:14.291 --> 19:17.000
I didn't.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.041
No.

19:23.500 --> 19:27.333
We met at a similar moment,
when we were both trying

19:27.333 --> 19:30.208
to figure out
who we were going to be.

19:31.834 --> 19:34.542
-And did you?
-What?

19:34.542 --> 19:37.250
Turn out the way you figured
back then?

19:39.959 --> 19:42.333
In some ways, we did.

19:42.333 --> 19:45.375
And in other important ways,
we maybe fell a little short.

19:46.959 --> 19:51.417
You're at a similar moment

19:51.417 --> 19:55.917
with a similar unlimited
possibility.

19:57.792 --> 20:00.417
-Okay.
-In all my years here,

20:00.417 --> 20:02.333
no one has walked
through that door

20:02.333 --> 20:05.875
because they were worried
how another person was feeling.

20:05.875 --> 20:08.125
If you were anyone else,
I'd think you were pranking me.

20:08.125 --> 20:12.667
I am different.

20:12.667 --> 20:14.333
Uh, yeah.

20:17.417 --> 20:20.750
As far as Mafee goes,
maybe just tell him

20:20.750 --> 20:22.625
you think he's doing
a good job.

20:23.708 --> 20:25.917
He's not.

20:25.917 --> 20:28.500
And I don't like to lie.
To myself, to others.

20:28.500 --> 20:30.750
I've been there,
and I'm past that.

20:30.750 --> 20:35.708
Well, then encourage him
without words.

20:35.708 --> 20:37.208
Let him know you care.

20:37.208 --> 20:39.250
How?

20:40.750 --> 20:42.875
Just buy him something.

20:47.208 --> 20:48.875
Look, I'm just saying.

20:48.875 --> 20:49.959
How many major banks
have had their CEOs

20:49.959 --> 20:51.375
sent to fucking jail?

20:51.375 --> 20:55.166
Jail!
It's a small list, isn't it?

20:55.166 --> 20:56.583
Spartan-Ives is tainted.

20:56.583 --> 20:59.583
A lot of shops don't want them
walking through the door.

20:59.583 --> 21:02.291
I get the anti-them.
What's the pro-you?

21:02.291 --> 21:04.250
Industry leaders,
like Axe Capital,

21:04.250 --> 21:06.417
need to get away
from the gilded cage.

21:06.417 --> 21:08.792
-That's why we host--
-How much will you undercut

21:08.792 --> 21:10.667
Spartan-Ives
over the next two years?

21:10.667 --> 21:11.667
Ten percent.

21:11.667 --> 21:14.375
That's promising.
On the money.

21:14.375 --> 21:17.041
But on the pleasure end,
it's not gonna cut it.

21:17.041 --> 21:20.291

Kind of mangy.

37:20.125 --> 37:22.417
I understand
it's the coyote blood.

37:22.417 --> 37:25.166
Terrific organization, though.

37:41.000 --> 37:45.125
So, are we shaking hands?

37:45.125 --> 37:47.625
Humbled as I am

37:47.625 --> 37:49.834
I must decline.

So, you got what you came for.

37:59.166 --> 38:00.625
You now know--

38:00.625 --> 38:02.583
That you weren't trying
to fuck me over

38:02.583 --> 38:04.792

38:04.792 --> 38:07.083

38:13.750 --> 38:16.041
Would you mind telling me who?

38:18.500 --> 38:21.583
Inelegant of you to even ask.

38:21.583 --> 38:24.583
Because it forces me to say
that the Location Board

38:24.583 --> 38:26.041
combs through many factors.

38:26.041 --> 38:29.291
Sandicot submitted a proposal
and was under consideration,

38:29.291 --> 38:31.375
as were many other locations.
Ultimately--

38:31.375 --> 38:33.625
The committee chose the location
that would bring

38:33.625 --> 38:36.333
the greatest benefit to
the greatest number of people.

38:36.333 --> 38:37.708
Yes, I know the party line.

38:37.708 --> 38:39.166
You could have written
something more stylish.

38:39.166 --> 38:41.750
It's not
supposed to be stylish.

38:41.750 --> 38:44.291
It's supposed to make you feel
a little bit ill,

38:44.291 --> 38:46.750
like an out-of-season oyster.

38:48.125 --> 38:50.333
You got into this room,
Mr. Axelrod,

38:50.333 --> 38:53.959
because I appreciated the, uh,
fluidity of your tactics.

38:53.959 --> 38:56.667
Thank you.

38:56.667 --> 39:00.333
But our relationship ends
right there.

39:00.333 --> 39:03.166
If we'd come together
some other way, I'd feel certain

39:03.166 --> 39:05.291
we might have been
something like friends,

39:05.291 --> 39:07.166
but that can never
happen now,

39:07.166 --> 39:09.792

of your gifts.

39:09.792 --> 39:12.500
I hold to a code of loyalty,

39:12.500 --> 39:15.125
which may very well be outmoded,
but has served me well.

39:15.125 --> 39:18.708
And to be honest,

39:18.708 --> 39:22.333
I like the way it makes me feel
when I choose sides.

39:22.333 --> 39:26.500
Well, that's something
I can understand.

39:26.500 --> 39:29.667
Understand this, too, then.

39:31.542 --> 39:35.333
I know you're not satisfied
with what you've learned.

39:35.333 --> 39:37.208
Your search will continue,

39:37.208 --> 39:40.750

I was closing off,

Whatever's meant to happen
always does.

50:37.166 --> 50:39.834
I know. I know.
It's starting to feel real.

50:39.834 --> 50:42.250
Heavy lies the head that...

50:44.500 --> 50:47.875
The hesitation
is still about Axelrod.

50:47.875 --> 50:49.250
Yes.

50:51.542 --> 50:52.917
Ah.

50:54.375 --> 50:58.041
You know the joke about
the two bulls on top of the hill

50:58.041 --> 50:59.750
and the cows down below?

50:59.750 --> 51:02.208
The young bull wants
to run down and fuck one.

51:02.208 --> 51:04.500
And the old bull says, "Let's
walk on down and fuck 'em all."

51:04.500 --> 51:08.959
That has been repeated so many
times in movies, TV shows.

51:08.959 --> 51:10.083
It's taken
as received wisdom,

51:10.083 --> 51:14.250
except the thing is
you can't.

51:16.667 --> 51:20.834
Nobody gets to fuck 'em all.

51:20.834 --> 51:24.875
You got to choose
which one you're gonna fuck,

51:24.875 --> 51:29.708

53:01.750 --> 53:04.041
I really don't know
what you're talking about.

53:04.041 --> 53:06.208
You thought moving that casino
would, what, fuck me up?

53:06.208 --> 53:09.375
Get me to sell off
one of my jets?

53:09.375 --> 53:11.291
Well,
guess what I'm doing now.

53:11.291 --> 53:14.625
Losing your religion

Drinking that town's

will be mine,

53:20.000 --> 53:22.500
sold off, recycled,

53:22.500 --> 53:25.125
stuck on a pedestal
in my office, doesn't matter.

53:25.125 --> 53:27.834
In the end, I will not lose

53:27.834 --> 53:30.333
one single penny from Sandicot.

53:30.333 --> 53:33.542
In fact, I will be made whole,
more than whole,

53:33.542 --> 53:38.708
but you will have spent all that
political capital for nothing.

53:38.708 --> 53:41.166
Well, as I said,
I really have no idea

53:41.166 --> 53:43.333
what you're talking about.

53:43.333 --> 53:46.708
But, Dad, isn't there a dress
code in the common areas?

53:46.708 --> 53:51.125
Did Morgan at the front desk
not offer you a courtesy blazer?

53:51.125 --> 53:54.333
-Hmm.
-We apologize on his behalf.

53:54.333 --> 53:57.500
That type of rudeness
is unacceptable.

54:01.000 --> 54:03.667

54:03.667 --> 54:06.708
that a boy never
really becomes a man

54:06.708 --> 54:09.000
until he's buried
his father.

54:09.708 --> 54:11.542
Now,
mine's been dead to me

54:11.542 --> 54:14.417
since the moment he walked out
when I was 12 years old.

54:14.417 --> 54:15.875
I don't remember if I cried,

54:15.875 --> 54:18.625
but I do remember that I was
forced to grow the fuck up.

54:20.125 --> 54:23.500
So it always warms my heart
when I see a boy

54:23.500 --> 54:27.917
who still has his father's
shoulder to lean on,

54:27.917 --> 54:30.542
his father's contacts
to deploy,

54:30.542 --> 54:34.708

around in place of his own,

quite dropped yet.

if it was part of your plan
