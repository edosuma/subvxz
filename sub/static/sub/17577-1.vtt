00:00.255 --> 00:03.338
(smooth jazz music)

01:34.467 --> 01:39.467
(vehicles whooshing)
(metallic rattling)

01:43.859 --> 01:47.276
(pedestrians chattering)

01:54.209 --> 01:56.483
(music drowns out voices)

01:56.483 --> 01:59.051
- [Man] This one, (music
drowns out voice) here,

01:59.051 --> 02:03.310
got the automatic (music
drowns out voice).

02:03.310 --> 02:08.310
(groovy jazz music)
(truck beeping)

02:20.027 --> 02:24.476
- Hi, Melanie.
- Oh, hey, Jim, I'm sorry.

02:24.476 --> 02:27.760
I can't believe how late I'm running.

02:27.760 --> 02:31.010
(thudding)
- I'm early.

02:34.170 --> 02:35.520
- [Melanie] Come on, Billy.

02:37.663 --> 02:40.151
- (faint speaking) It's
like a war out there.

02:40.151 --> 02:42.870
(thudding)

02:42.870 --> 02:44.293
- Well, stay warm.
- 'Night, Marty.

02:47.059 --> 02:48.809
- Bye, Jim.
- 'Night.

02:57.620 --> 03:02.404
- [Marty] Hey, Jim, Howard
can't make it tonight.

03:02.404 --> 03:03.700
- Why, he's working overtime again?

03:03.700 --> 03:05.973
- Oh, no, his wife is sick.

03:09.270 --> 03:12.123
He was gonna speak for me tonight.

03:14.410 --> 03:15.840
- Hey, listen, man, you don't wanna know

03:15.840 --> 03:17.040
what's goin' on with me.

03:18.489 --> 03:20.963
- When was the last time
you spoke at a meeting?

03:22.378 --> 03:24.878
- About seven months ago,
why, you don't remember?

03:28.061 --> 03:28.894
- You need it.

03:31.600 --> 03:34.201
- Hey (chuckles).
- Hi, how you doin'?

03:34.201 --> 03:37.362
- Okay, I'm okay, how you doin'?

03:37.362 --> 03:39.197
(exclaims)

03:39.197 --> 03:40.788
(faint speaking)
Doing good.

03:40.788 --> 03:41.922
- Yeah.
- I'm doing good.

03:41.922 --> 03:44.755
- Doing all right, you look great.

03:50.437 --> 03:51.862
- Hey, Marty.

03:51.862 --> 03:54.709
- Hey, Tony, well, it's day 25.

03:54.709 --> 03:56.027
- 26.
- 26, great.

03:57.755 --> 03:59.705
Your sponsor's in the kitchen.
- Okay.

04:01.894 --> 04:05.144
- Get the fuck outta here, fucking way.

04:07.130 --> 04:08.321
Hey.
- How you doing, Jimmy?

04:08.321 --> 04:10.388
- How you doing, good to see you.

04:10.388 --> 04:12.520
Listen, I called you back,
but I got your machine

04:12.520 --> 04:15.420
so, uh, you know, it didn't
pick up or something, you know?

04:15.420 --> 04:16.980
- Yeah, well, I didn't
get the message but--

04:16.980 --> 04:19.220
- No, no, I called you.
- All right, whatever, you--

04:19.220 --> 04:21.029
- How you doin'?
- I'm all right.

04:21.029 --> 04:23.120
Well, I'm upset, I'm
angry, I'm, I'm nervous.

04:23.120 --> 04:26.009
I'm angry, you know--
- Why, the resume again?

04:26.009 --> 04:28.510
- (sighs) The resume, man,
you know, the resume already,

04:28.510 --> 04:30.740
you know, I'm like I go
to the computer place

04:30.740 --> 04:32.520
or the printing whatever
the hell it is, I go there

04:32.520 --> 04:36.080
to pick it up, I hand over the 25 bucks.

04:36.080 --> 04:37.913
- Right.
- Which is ridiculous.

04:38.880 --> 04:42.718
Then I go to a diner to pick
up my 579th cup of coffee

04:42.718 --> 04:44.970
you know, I gotta refuel, gotta refuel,

04:44.970 --> 04:47.066
another cup of coffee, it's 11
o'clock and I'm still tired,

04:47.066 --> 04:48.193
but I'm wired, tired and wired.

04:49.400 --> 04:52.660
So, I leave, I walk two
blocks, look at this hand,

04:52.660 --> 04:56.240
then I look at this hand,
shaking, oops, no resume--

04:56.240 --> 04:57.310
- Hey, Tony, let me ask you--
- Back in the diner--

04:57.310 --> 04:58.243
- Tony.
- What?

04:59.315 --> 05:00.630
- You wanna hear this?
- Yeah, I heard it already.

05:00.630 --> 05:01.580
- You don't care, then I don't care.

05:01.580 --> 05:03.323
- Tony, hey, did you drink today?

05:05.361 --> 05:06.770
- (exhales sharply) No,
but I'll tell ya, I'd love

05:06.770 --> 05:08.473
a nice Mexican with a lime, you know,

05:08.473 --> 05:10.443
I just wanna get wasted, man.

05:11.380 --> 05:13.153
- So what, you're an alcoholic.

05:14.570 --> 05:16.630
- Yeah, definitely.
- Yeah.

05:16.630 --> 05:17.640
So then why don't you go out there and put

05:17.640 --> 05:20.053
some fuckin' ashtrays on
the chairs, all right?

05:20.930 --> 05:21.783
Go on.
- Yeah.

05:27.150 --> 05:28.690
- Hey, Tony, help me out here.

05:30.910 --> 05:32.926
Let's move the chair.
- No, no, no, leave it--

05:32.926 --> 05:34.370
- You're just, you're making it harder.

05:34.370 --> 05:35.887
- Leave it, leave it.

05:37.454 --> 05:38.896
- [Debbie] Hey Marty, what's up?

05:38.896 --> 05:41.009
- [Marty] Debbie, glad you made it.

05:41.009 --> 05:42.583
- Yeah, right.
- Hey.

05:42.583 --> 05:43.830
- Hey there, how you doin', Jasmine?

05:43.830 --> 05:45.593
- (chuckles) I'm doin' good, what is this?

05:45.593 --> 05:48.180
- It's a cotton animal
that I slaughtered and--

05:48.180 --> 05:49.907
- Uh-huh (laughs).
- No, I don't like fur.

05:49.907 --> 05:52.569
I don't wear fur, I'm
against it, I love this lame.

05:52.569 --> 05:53.470
- Child, isn't it nice?
- Jasmine, I'm,

05:53.470 --> 05:55.970
I'm reading the Bible.
- You readin' the Bible?

05:55.970 --> 05:58.340
- Mm-hm.
- Where, where'd you start?

05:58.340 --> 06:00.380
- In the beginning.
- Uh-huh, good.

06:00.380 --> 06:01.920
- Yeah, you think that's good?
(Jasmine laughs)

06:01.920 --> 06:03.550
I'm still smoking though, Marty did you

06:03.550 --> 06:06.021
bust out and buy some hot cocoa--

06:06.021 --> 06:07.061
- [Marty] Put some more in the baskets.

06:07.061 --> 06:08.905
- The little packages, they're very cheap.

06:08.905 --> 06:10.862
- [Marty] Yeah.

06:10.862 --> 06:14.200
- Yeah, Marty, she's readin' the Bible.

06:14.200 --> 06:16.370
- Well, don't tell her how it turns out.

06:16.370 --> 06:17.720
- No, they've known since this morning

06:17.720 --> 06:21.340
that Dr. Rubin was gonna
cover for me, mm-hmm.

06:21.340 --> 06:23.843
Now I'm sure he's there,
yes, just page him.

06:24.740 --> 06:26.916
Yes, I'll be back in an hour, okay.

06:26.916 --> 06:29.816
- Hey, skinny, you spare some
change for alcohol research?

06:30.654 --> 06:32.257
Fine, you can keep it.
(Jasmine laughing)

06:32.257 --> 06:35.800
- Come on (faint speaking).
- All right.

06:35.800 --> 06:37.311
(people chattering)

06:37.311 --> 06:39.561
(laughing)

06:40.808 --> 06:44.050
- [Marty] Carol, can you
read the preamble for us?

06:44.050 --> 06:46.035
Shelley, would you (faint speaking)?

06:46.035 --> 06:48.099
- [Shelley] Oh yes.

06:48.099 --> 06:51.016
(group chattering)

06:53.410 --> 06:55.513
- These always go first, you know?

06:55.513 --> 06:58.180
- Yeah.
- Get a long black coat.

07:03.200 --> 07:04.890
- [Marty] Change your mind yet?

07:04.890 --> 07:05.763
- Marty, no.

07:07.070 --> 07:07.903
- [Marty] Why?

07:08.790 --> 07:10.840
- 'Cause I'm not in the mood, that's why.

07:14.130 --> 07:15.990
- What's eatin' you?

07:15.990 --> 07:18.640
- I just don't feel like
talkin' about it, all right?

07:19.550 --> 07:22.860
- When you're asked to talk,
you say yes, you know that.

07:22.860 --> 07:26.597
- Yeah, there are no rules in AA (scoffs).

07:28.505 --> 07:29.973
- Now come on, help me out.

07:29.973 --> 07:32.533
I need, I need to hear a
real war story tonight.

07:32.533 --> 07:34.280
- Then go fuckin' rent Apocalypse Now,

07:34.280 --> 07:35.533
really, get off my back.
- Shh.

07:35.533 --> 07:36.383
- Come on, Marty.

07:43.890 --> 07:46.563
Jesus Christ, all right, happy?

07:48.910 --> 07:50.027
- Gotcha (faint speaking).

07:52.687 --> 07:56.760
And here to share his experience, strength

07:56.760 --> 07:59.801
and hope with us tonight is Jim.

07:59.801 --> 08:04.801
- Come on, Jim.
(group clapping)

08:12.640 --> 08:15.070
- Hi, I'm Jim, and I'm an alcoholic.

08:15.070 --> 08:16.140
- [Group] Hi Jim.

08:16.140 --> 08:20.343
- And there's no escaping from
that because that's who I am.

08:22.240 --> 08:24.970
Yeah, you know, I could,
I could take a little kid

08:24.970 --> 08:27.450
to the zoo or I could make an egg cream

08:27.450 --> 08:29.953
or I can even ride a
fucking camel if I wanted,

08:30.800 --> 08:33.659
but what I can't do is have a
fucking drink, and that's all

08:33.659 --> 08:36.663
that matters, one drink, just
one, you know what I mean?

08:37.610 --> 08:39.917
I've been a drunk and a
drug addict for 25 years

08:39.917 --> 08:42.750
and I'm sick of it, I really
didn't wanna be up here

08:42.750 --> 08:47.260
tonight, but Marty cornered
me, so what's my story?

08:47.260 --> 08:51.203
I was born an only child to a really,

08:52.570 --> 08:55.080
really sweet angelic Italian woman

08:56.220 --> 09:00.633
and to a poor, fucking
embarrassed-to-be-Jew father,

09:01.800 --> 09:05.410
Saul, or as he preferred to
be called in the neighborhood,

09:05.410 --> 09:09.053
Sal, when I was nine, I made a xylophone

09:09.053 --> 09:11.490
out of Saul's empties.

09:11.490 --> 09:14.060
I took them to school for show and tell,

09:14.060 --> 09:17.810
and that was the very first
time and the only time

09:17.810 --> 09:20.240
that my father beat the shit out of me,

09:20.240 --> 09:22.203
pulled the belt right out of his pants,

09:23.040 --> 09:25.400
had a Joe DiMaggio buckle on it.

09:25.400 --> 09:28.833
Imagine that, Joe D, and he
whipped the shit outta me.

09:29.960 --> 09:34.299
That night, I stole a bottle
from my dad, a whole pint.

09:34.299 --> 09:36.043
(chuckles softly) Scotch.

09:37.380 --> 09:40.803
Man, did I sleep, like a fucking top.

09:42.160 --> 09:45.350
By the time I got outta high
school, I was a daily drinker.

09:45.350 --> 09:47.580
Thank God I landed a job at a steakhouse

09:47.580 --> 09:51.670
in the Theater District, I
could drink around the clock.

09:51.670 --> 09:53.993
I was hiding it, you
know, I'd be pouring it

09:53.993 --> 09:55.873
in a fucking styrofoam cup.

09:56.780 --> 09:59.430
You know, we figure like
no one ever fucking knows.

09:59.430 --> 10:01.240
Trust me, by, you know,
midnight, I was seating

10:01.240 --> 10:02.590
people on the fucking roof.

10:04.300 --> 10:06.350
I started getting up
to about a quart a day

10:06.350 --> 10:09.830
after about three years, a quart a day,

10:09.830 --> 10:12.677
that's all, that ain't
nothin', you know why?

10:12.677 --> 10:15.530
'Cause I wasn't even gettin' drunk anymore

10:15.530 --> 10:18.370
on a quart a day, I mean I
wasn't even gettin' high,

10:18.370 --> 10:19.453
where is that at?

10:20.420 --> 10:22.720
That's when I started doing heroin.

10:22.720 --> 10:27.580
I wasted 10 years of my life,
strung out, broke, alone,

10:27.580 --> 10:30.890
except for my only friend, some
Ninth Avenue hooker, Tanya.

10:30.890 --> 10:33.200
I mean, I knew about AA and all that shit.

10:33.200 --> 10:35.730
I had some little
shit-faced neighbor of mine,

10:35.730 --> 10:37.880
he took me to a meeting, ah, fuck that.

10:37.880 --> 10:40.230
I thought it was for boozers, man.

10:40.230 --> 10:44.683
Holy rollers, Bowery bums,
I didn't need it, fuck that.

10:45.560 --> 10:48.630
Do it on my own, man, kick dope.

10:48.630 --> 10:51.370
Shit, I once went a whole
month, just to prove to myself

10:51.370 --> 10:52.690
that I could do it on my own.

10:52.690 --> 10:54.930
I didn't even smoke a fucking cigarette,

10:54.930 --> 10:59.930
that's how cool I was and
then, I met my goddess.

11:01.580 --> 11:03.773
Oh, man, did we fall in love.

11:04.780 --> 11:08.780
It was the greatest, the greatest feeling.

11:09.809 --> 11:14.280
Gawd, we started going out, couple weeks,

11:14.280 --> 11:16.183
boom, moved in with her.

11:17.500 --> 11:19.100
I mean I was still drinking
and she didn't know

11:19.100 --> 11:21.360
that I was an alcoholic, I mean
she used to drink champagne

11:21.360 --> 11:23.810
with friends and I used
to join her, you know,

11:23.810 --> 11:26.410
it's a celebration, she
didn't know, what did she have

11:26.410 --> 11:27.480
to know, you know what I mean?

11:27.480 --> 11:30.167
I wasn't druggin' or
anything, just drinkin'.

11:31.270 --> 11:32.720
Then I asked her to marry me.

11:33.900 --> 11:38.900
She said yes, wow, oh, Jesus Christ,

11:39.120 --> 11:40.143
I was in heaven.

11:43.000 --> 11:46.690
Till I had one of those disasters.

11:46.690 --> 11:50.250
She took me to meet her
family, all 200 of them.

11:50.250 --> 11:53.170
I couldn't deal with it,
I guess I just freaked.

11:53.170 --> 11:56.483
I go upstairs and I never, ever come back.

11:57.330 --> 12:00.690
I passed out, boy, that pint went fast.

12:00.690 --> 12:02.820
She got me into a cab,
we got back to New York

12:02.820 --> 12:03.767
and she looked at me and she says,

12:03.767 --> 12:08.217
"I love you, I'll marry
you, but you're going

12:08.217 --> 12:10.820
"into rehab or I'm history."

12:10.820 --> 12:12.953
Well, I checked right in.

12:14.360 --> 12:17.100
I had no choice, I loved her.

12:17.100 --> 12:20.793
I was sober, we were like
a regular married couple.

12:20.793 --> 12:22.860
(chuckles softly) We went
on picnics and took rides

12:22.860 --> 12:24.283
on the Staten Island Ferry.

12:25.500 --> 12:27.100
That was almost three years ago.

12:28.942 --> 12:32.130
A lot of you know about
eight months ago, Janie died.

12:34.760 --> 12:36.473
Just like that, brain aneurism.

12:38.420 --> 12:41.490
Oh, man, sometimes I go home now

12:41.490 --> 12:43.877
and I still expect to
see her there, you know?

12:45.050 --> 12:47.800
Gawd, I wish I would've made
love to her a little more.

12:49.740 --> 12:50.963
If only I woulda known.

12:52.920 --> 12:55.170
You know, I guess I'm
just fighting it today.

12:56.576 --> 13:00.870
(exhales sharply) Christ,
you wanna know the truth?

13:00.870 --> 13:02.143
I just wanna get high!

13:04.110 --> 13:06.280
I just don't understand
it anymore, you know?

13:06.280 --> 13:07.513
I just don't get it.

13:09.137 --> 13:12.440
I mean I know that Janie just
had to go, I guess, you know?

13:12.440 --> 13:15.623
But I mean I, I never knew love like that,

13:18.000 --> 13:18.873
before her.

13:21.660 --> 13:23.751
I just don't wanna be with anybody else.

13:23.751 --> 13:27.668
Fuck!
(bangs)

13:37.338 --> 13:39.233
(sighs)

13:39.233 --> 13:42.493
But, hey, you know, the guy
that brought me into this room,

13:44.078 --> 13:46.463
(sighs) he said you know don't think,

13:47.800 --> 13:51.313
don't drink, and go to a meeting.

13:52.650 --> 13:55.030
And that's, that's worked for me

13:57.792 --> 13:58.693
a day at a time.

14:00.913 --> 14:05.913
Thanks.
(group clapping)

14:10.142 --> 14:13.070
- In accordance with
the seventh tradition,

14:13.070 --> 14:16.070
it's time to pass the
baskets, so give what you can.

14:16.070 --> 14:18.600
If you can't, keep coming back.

14:18.600 --> 14:20.600
We need you more than we need the money.

14:21.840 --> 14:26.613
Okay, now, any visitors from--
- Gonna get some air.

14:27.830 --> 14:30.490
- Uh, visitors from out
of town or anybody new

14:30.490 --> 14:32.570
that's been in these rooms
that wants to say hi?

14:32.570 --> 14:35.480
- I knew you had money.
- Hi, my name is Rachel.

14:35.480 --> 14:37.356
I'm an alcoholic and an addict.

14:37.356 --> 14:39.630
- Hi Rachel.
- Welcome.

14:39.630 --> 14:41.700
- Anybody counting days?

14:41.700 --> 14:44.540
- Yeah, my name's Tony
and I'm a drunk and I have

14:44.540 --> 14:46.609
26 days today.
(group applauding)

14:46.609 --> 14:47.442
- Yay.

14:49.559 --> 14:51.490
- [Tony] Thanks.

14:51.490 --> 14:54.670
- Yeah, hi, my name is
Dennis and I'm an alcoholic.

14:54.670 --> 14:55.960
- Hi, Dennis.
- Hi.

14:55.960 --> 14:58.401
And I have 72 days.
(group applauding)

14:58.401 --> 15:02.984
- [Woman] All right (faint speaking).

15:04.650 --> 15:09.400
- Look, Jim, I just want
you to know that I know it,

15:09.400 --> 15:12.273
I know it was hard for you,
but it meant so much to me.

15:13.200 --> 15:14.797
You spoke the truth.

15:16.852 --> 15:18.519
- It was fairy tale.

15:20.320 --> 15:22.660
A big lie.
- Wait a minute.

15:22.660 --> 15:25.720
What can we do, all right,
we got one day at a time,

15:25.720 --> 15:27.523
that's all we do, c'mon.

15:29.097 --> 15:31.013
(group clapping)

15:31.013 --> 15:33.890
(applause drowns out voice)
- Substance abuser.

15:33.890 --> 15:38.127
- Hey, put those cookies
back, shame on you.

15:39.423 --> 15:42.570
(clapping drowns out voice)

15:42.570 --> 15:45.961
- Debbie, alcoholic, I got 90 days.

15:45.961 --> 15:47.411
(group clapping)
Rock, rock!

15:54.430 --> 15:56.950
- [Marty] Anybody else counting days?

15:56.950 --> 16:00.198
- [Charlie] Hi, my name is
Charlie and I'm an alcoholic.

16:00.198 --> 16:05.198
(heels clicking)
(group clapping)

16:09.237 --> 16:11.987
(doors rattling)

16:13.496 --> 16:17.913
- Is anybody else celebrating
an anniversary tonight?

16:18.900 --> 16:22.030
- Hi, my name is Terry
and I'm an alcoholic.

16:22.030 --> 16:22.980
- [Group] Hi Terry.

16:24.402 --> 16:28.620
- (chuckles softly) And I'm
confused about my anniversary

16:28.620 --> 16:30.780
because I'm not sure if
I should count the days

16:30.780 --> 16:33.560
I was tied up in a straitjacket or not.

16:33.560 --> 16:36.145
If not, tonight's a year.

16:36.145 --> 16:38.501
(group clapping)

16:38.501 --> 16:40.168
- I think it counts.

16:42.100 --> 16:45.253
- Joseph, drug addict, alcoholic.

16:46.560 --> 16:50.988
By the grace of God, one day
at a time, I got two years.

16:50.988 --> 16:54.118
- All right.
(group clapping)

16:54.118 --> 16:57.285
(chuckles) All right.

16:59.586 --> 17:04.530
- Now, okay, according
to the 12th Tradition,

17:04.530 --> 17:09.530
anonymity is the chief
spiritual foundation

17:10.260 --> 17:12.700
of our program, ever reminding us

17:12.700 --> 17:15.203
to place principles above personalities.

17:16.160 --> 17:18.733
What you see here and what
you hear here, leave here.

17:21.450 --> 17:24.083
Where the hell is Jim, hey, Jim!

17:27.069 --> 17:30.053
All right, we'll continue the
meeting with a show of hands.

17:35.060 --> 17:38.371
- Hi, I'm Shelley and I'm an alcoholic.

17:38.371 --> 17:40.600
- [Group] Hi Shelley.

17:40.600 --> 17:44.610
- My mother is in town
and she is staying with me

17:44.610 --> 17:48.337
in my bedroom in my bed
with me (chuckles softly).

17:50.820 --> 17:53.753
I'm just a little too old to
be sleeping with my mother.

17:56.159 --> 17:58.743
(grunts softly)

17:58.743 --> 18:00.500
You know, if I could crawl
out of my skin, I would.

18:00.500 --> 18:04.220
I would, I would, I would,
and as it is, I hardly breathe

18:04.220 --> 18:07.730
and I pray to God that
she's not able to hear me

18:07.730 --> 18:10.253
when I'm lying down next to her.

18:12.290 --> 18:15.440
Today, I am running all over the place

18:15.440 --> 18:18.290
'cause (faint speaking) is my
mother's birthday coming up

18:19.628 --> 18:23.340
(exhales sharply) tomorrow
and she doesn't need anything.

18:23.340 --> 18:25.733
She's loaded, loaded.

18:27.200 --> 18:29.270
And you know what I'd like to get her?

18:29.270 --> 18:34.200
I'd like to get her exactly,
I would like to get her

18:35.360 --> 18:39.043
chocolate-covered (blows
raspberry) Valium--

18:39.043 --> 18:41.710
(group chuckles)
Or (scoffs) I know what,

18:41.710 --> 18:44.940
a good hit of Ecstasy, now
that, that, I would like to see

18:45.919 --> 18:50.167
on something like that.
(group chuckling)

18:51.670 --> 18:54.390
I know I'm overreacting, and
she tells me enough times

18:54.390 --> 18:58.660
that I'm overreacting, so
but I'm in the middle of it

18:58.660 --> 19:03.600
right now and I can't
see my way out, you know?

19:05.125 --> 19:09.560
So but I have to remember
that I am a survivor,

19:09.560 --> 19:13.868
that I survived alcoholism
and not to mention

19:13.868 --> 19:16.193
the tender loving care of my mother,

19:17.600 --> 19:20.312
so I can survive this, right?

19:20.312 --> 19:22.363
(chuckles) I'm shaking like crazy.

19:24.654 --> 19:28.110
I think, I think, I think,
I think, I really think

19:28.110 --> 19:31.200
that my, my parents are fine people

19:31.200 --> 19:34.623
and they're just not the way
that I wanted them to be.

19:36.478 --> 19:37.817
Thanks (chuckles).

19:39.956 --> 19:41.556
- Thanks for sharing.
- Thanks.

19:44.983 --> 19:49.066
(smooth jazz instrumental music)

20:34.185 --> 20:36.670
- [Man] I don't know
what's going on with Jim.

20:36.670 --> 20:39.623
- Yeah, yeah, I'm sure he's
fine, I'm gonna find him.

20:39.623 --> 20:41.920
I'll find him.
- Okay, well,

20:41.920 --> 20:44.235
let's go back to the show of hands.

20:44.235 --> 20:47.902
(groovy instrumental music)

21:16.386 --> 21:20.538
- Jimmy, Jimmy, it's Tony,
pick it up, pick it up.

21:20.538 --> 21:23.540
You screen your calls,
come on, pick it up.

21:23.540 --> 21:27.273
Okay, listen, do me a favor,
I want you to call 555-1234

21:27.273 --> 21:30.507
when you get in, it's the
phone booth in the hall.

21:30.507 --> 21:32.543
Just wanna know that
you're okay, all right?

21:39.107 --> 21:41.781
(record scratching music)

21:41.781 --> 21:44.903
- (sighs) Hi, my name is Jim
and I want a pint of bourbon.

21:50.500 --> 21:51.693
Fuck, ah (grunts) fuck.

21:55.686 --> 21:58.341
(cars honking in the distance)

21:58.341 --> 22:00.766
(glass thudding)

22:00.766 --> 22:05.090
Man, fuck!

22:05.090 --> 22:07.203
Oh, gah, son of a bitch.

22:09.913 --> 22:12.333
It's the first drink that gets you drunk.

22:13.840 --> 22:16.752
It's the first drink that--
(glass thudding)

22:16.752 --> 22:17.585
Ah.

22:22.400 --> 22:26.083
Oh, fuck you in the ass, you fuck.

22:29.860 --> 22:34.313
- See, two years ago
today, I had my last drink,

22:35.750 --> 22:40.140
my last blackout, and it was the last time

22:40.140 --> 22:42.013
I saw my wife and little boy.

22:43.540 --> 22:46.920
I, uh, was drinking all morning

22:48.220 --> 22:53.000
and I had to go up to to the
Bronx, check my little boy

22:53.000 --> 22:55.310
and drop him off with his grandmother

22:55.310 --> 22:57.560
and then I had some
business to take care of.

23:06.150 --> 23:08.647
Next thing I knew, I, uh,

23:11.890 --> 23:14.433
I woke up in jail in a cell by myself.

23:17.860 --> 23:21.830
I, I, I said oh, shit, when I woke up,

23:21.830 --> 23:25.610
you know, like oh,
fuck, done got picked up

23:25.610 --> 23:27.793
for drunk driving or some shit like that,

23:28.710 --> 23:33.710
so I walked over to where,
um, the guard was standing

23:33.990 --> 23:36.660
and I said, uh, give me a cigarette

23:38.272 --> 23:42.297
and he wouldn't turn around
and he wouldn't say nothing.

23:43.220 --> 23:46.113
So I said, come on, man,
give me a fucking cigarette!

23:49.410 --> 23:52.763
He still wouldn't, uh, turn around,

23:53.950 --> 23:58.860
so I said, okay, man, let me
make my fucking phone call.

23:58.860 --> 24:03.260
Let me call my wife, she
don't know where I'm at.

24:03.260 --> 24:05.890
She's worried, she don't
know where the fuck I am.

24:05.890 --> 24:07.790
Let me call my wife and my little boy.

24:09.790 --> 24:14.790
Then (exhales sharply) this
motherfucker turned around

24:16.390 --> 24:19.577
and he looked at me and he said,

24:19.577 --> 24:22.423
"What the fuck are you talking about!

24:25.497 --> 24:28.900
"Don't you remember what you did?"

24:28.900 --> 24:32.263
I said, remember what?

24:33.670 --> 24:34.543
He said, um,

24:39.500 --> 24:43.537
he said, "Your little
boy was in car with you

24:43.537 --> 24:45.267
"and he went through
the windshield and now,

24:45.267 --> 24:48.127
"he's at the ICU at Bellevue."

24:50.240 --> 24:52.823
Now, I love my little boy.

24:53.800 --> 24:57.980
I used to put him in a stroller,
push him around for people

24:57.980 --> 25:02.707
to see and now, I had his
blood on my hands, you know?

25:08.990 --> 25:13.130
I am feeling fucking crazy tonight.

25:13.130 --> 25:14.493
I am scared!

25:16.220 --> 25:19.560
I'm scared, Jim freaked the fuck outta me.

25:19.560 --> 25:22.583
We used to get fucked up together,

25:23.740 --> 25:26.983
and now, I'm afraid I'm gonna
do something crazy to somebody

25:26.983 --> 25:30.310
or maybe to myself and
I don't wanna do that.

25:30.310 --> 25:33.460
I just don't wanna do that,
goddamn, my little boy.

25:33.460 --> 25:35.543
He was only five years old.

25:40.000 --> 25:43.690
I'm just so mad

25:43.690 --> 25:47.203
at my fucking self 'cause I cannot drink!

25:51.590 --> 25:52.423
Dammit.

25:56.600 --> 26:01.450
Uh, I think I better stop talking now.

26:01.450 --> 26:02.820
I think I better...

26:05.110 --> 26:07.410
it'll be better if I
just listen to y'all talk

26:08.410 --> 26:13.410
because if I hadn't a-been a
fucking blackout alcoholic,

26:15.380 --> 26:19.393
none of this would've happened,
am I gonna pick up again?

26:20.280 --> 26:21.263
Fuck if I know.

26:23.690 --> 26:27.420
I'm gonna try, I'm gonna try
not to, that's all I can say.

26:27.420 --> 26:31.999
Just thanks.
(group muttering)

26:31.999 --> 26:32.990
- Hey, Jimmy.
- How are you?

26:32.990 --> 26:34.520
- Long time.
- Yeah.

26:34.520 --> 26:37.295
- Good to see you.
- Give me a pint, will you?

26:37.295 --> 26:38.520
- You don't need it, Jim.
- Oh, don't tell me

26:38.520 --> 26:39.540
what I fucking need, come on.

26:39.540 --> 26:41.250
- [Harry] Why are you
gonna do this to yourself?

26:41.250 --> 26:42.810
It's been two years.
- Oh, come on.

26:42.810 --> 26:44.650
I don't need a fucking lecture.

26:44.650 --> 26:46.430
- Take your business somewhere
else, I don't need it.

26:46.430 --> 26:47.630
- Spare me the bullshit.

26:49.747 --> 26:51.983
(metallic rattling)
What the fuck is this

26:51.983 --> 26:54.233
all about
- What's the magic word?

27:00.090 --> 27:00.923
- Oh.

27:02.262 --> 27:03.490
Holy mackerel.

27:03.490 --> 27:06.190
- What are you doing, Jim?
- What am I doing?

27:06.190 --> 27:08.507
I'm comparison shopping.
- Well, you're not drinking

27:08.507 --> 27:10.760
(faint speaking)
- I lived, Harry.

27:10.760 --> 27:12.650
I fucking lived, you
wore that vest every day

27:12.650 --> 27:16.000
18 hours behind that fucking
register, man, not me.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.760
You're the sucker.
- You're a lousy

27:17.760 --> 27:20.347
fucking drinker and a
pain-in-the-ass drunk, Jim.

27:20.347 --> 27:21.180
- Oh, yeah?

27:22.050 --> 27:24.640
Holy Christ, you got that
good shit from Passaic,

27:24.640 --> 27:28.160
New Jersey, you son of a bitch,
Harry, you motherfucker you.

27:28.160 --> 27:30.540
- You wanna walk out or
you wanna bounce out, Jim?

27:30.540 --> 27:32.940
- Come on, let's celebrate,
you motherfucker.

27:32.940 --> 27:36.790
Happy new year, Harry,
happy fucking new year.

27:36.790 --> 27:38.917
- All right, come on.
- What?

27:38.917 --> 27:41.317
- His machine (faint speaking) machine.

27:41.317 --> 27:43.440
- Yeah, hello, Jimmy, you boob.

27:43.440 --> 27:45.320
What did you go running outta here for?

27:45.320 --> 27:48.040
Come on, man.
- Yeah, come on, man.

27:48.040 --> 27:49.530
We get, go.
- (chuckles) Go, you--

27:49.530 --> 27:52.150
- People here love you,
man, I mean, but, you know,

27:52.150 --> 27:53.647
I can't handle these whiners
without you, man, so come on.

27:53.647 --> 27:55.770
You gotta call.

27:55.770 --> 27:56.603
- We love you.

27:56.603 --> 27:57.990
- We love you.
- We love you.

27:57.990 --> 28:02.100
- Yeah, so call 555-1234, all right?

28:02.100 --> 28:04.097
Shelley's here.
- Bye-bye, bye-bye.

28:04.097 --> 28:04.930
- Bye-bye.

28:06.461 --> 28:10.167
(exhales sharply) I'm worried, you know?

28:10.167 --> 28:12.000
I'm worried about him.

28:13.118 --> 28:14.941
- It's okay.
- Yeah.

28:14.941 --> 28:17.007
- It's okay, we're okay.

28:17.007 --> 28:19.757
(faint speaking)

28:20.680 --> 28:23.330
- Hi, I'm Francine and I
got a drinking problem.

28:23.330 --> 28:26.778
I'm also a spend-aholic
and I'm fun at parties.

28:26.778 --> 28:28.530
I'm really in a tizzy today.

28:28.530 --> 28:31.480
I was at Strawberries today
twice and I couldn't find

28:31.480 --> 28:33.230
anything to buy, I mean, I'm just looking

28:33.230 --> 28:35.940
for that perfect pair of
boots and the salesgirl

28:35.940 --> 28:37.910
was useless, but I was nice to her

28:37.910 --> 28:39.830
'cause I'm such a people pleaser.

28:39.830 --> 28:41.460
I mean, I did, I wanted to yell at her,

28:41.460 --> 28:44.490
but I'm trying to keep
the focus on myself.

28:44.490 --> 28:48.180
I mean, this is a selfish
program, and through this program,

28:48.180 --> 28:51.830
I've gotten to know me
and frankly, I love her.

28:51.830 --> 28:53.710
You know, it feels really
good to be here tonight.

28:53.710 --> 28:56.210
It feels like a party actually,
I mean, since I've been

28:56.210 --> 28:58.210
coming to AA, I haven't
been to any parties.

28:58.210 --> 29:00.050
I haven't needed to,
I mean all you people,

29:00.050 --> 29:01.930
you're like my entertainment committee.

29:01.930 --> 29:04.230
I mean I hardly even watch
TV anymore, I used to.

29:04.230 --> 29:06.360
I used to tape all of my
soap operas 'cause I'm such

29:06.360 --> 29:08.630
like a drama queen, but
I don't need to anymore

29:08.630 --> 29:11.720
because of all the drama
that goes on in this room.

29:11.720 --> 29:15.430
Last week, I was at a
meeting and I saw, you know,

29:15.430 --> 29:17.417
what's that George guy,
that hunk who plays

29:17.417 --> 29:20.260
that brain surgeon guy
on General Hospital?

29:20.260 --> 29:22.680
I mean in the flesh, right?

29:22.680 --> 29:26.020
And the way Jimmy is
struggling with a tragedy

29:26.020 --> 29:28.520
in his life, it's just
horrible, it almost,

29:28.520 --> 29:31.420
it's like too much for me
sometimes, like I can't bear it

29:31.420 --> 29:33.690
'cause like I never drank like that.

29:33.690 --> 29:35.892
I mean I was like, what
do you call where I was

29:35.892 --> 29:38.700
a social imbiber, that's what I was.

29:38.700 --> 29:40.210
Hey, but since I've been
coming to these rooms,

29:40.210 --> 29:43.780
I haven't touched one drop and
I've got a couple of months.

29:43.780 --> 29:45.670
I love listening to all your stories.

29:45.670 --> 29:47.960
They're really, they're so sweet.

29:47.960 --> 29:49.440
I wasn't that bad of an alcoholic.

29:49.440 --> 29:51.080
Actually, to tell you the
truth, sometimes, I think

29:51.080 --> 29:53.500
I'm not really an alcoholic
at all, I was just born,

29:53.500 --> 29:55.100
you know, thirsty, you know what I mean?

29:55.100 --> 29:58.103
Like thirsty.
(group laughing)

30:07.786 --> 30:12.786
(steps clicking)
(cars whooshing)

30:31.636 --> 30:33.636
(sighs)

30:50.109 --> 30:52.859
(train rattling)

31:03.560 --> 31:04.393
- Right now,

31:06.290 --> 31:07.590
I'm living with my mother.

31:08.680 --> 31:12.160
My little brother Malik,
he's 16, and my daughter,

31:12.160 --> 31:17.160
she's four and we're one
on top of each other.

31:17.550 --> 31:21.133
It's a railroad flat and the
bathroom is in the hallway.

31:22.330 --> 31:24.930
And I'm out of the house
most of time at least.

31:24.930 --> 31:27.353
I go to school at night and I try to work

31:27.353 --> 31:30.190
at Macy's as much as I can

31:30.190 --> 31:34.382
and I'm even taking singing lessons.

31:34.382 --> 31:37.133
(chuckles softly) It's
something I always wanted to do.

31:39.062 --> 31:44.062
But I, I, I came home
early last night though,

31:44.130 --> 31:46.053
and when I went into the bathroom,

31:46.970 --> 31:50.490
I saw my little brother Malik
sitting on the toilet bowl

31:50.490 --> 31:55.110
and he had his belt tied around his arm

31:55.110 --> 31:56.260
and he was shooting up.

31:57.570 --> 32:00.320
He's using my mother's
needles, she's a diabetic

32:00.320 --> 32:05.080
so she uses the needles for
insulin and it threw me back,

32:05.080 --> 32:08.970
you know, 'cause I used to
steal her needles too (scoffs)

32:08.970 --> 32:13.970
when I was using, she knew,
but what she gonna do?

32:15.870 --> 32:19.898
She told me she loved me
and she's gonna find out

32:19.898 --> 32:22.663
about Malik, you know,
it's just a matter of time.

32:23.750 --> 32:25.720
It's gonna break her heart,
you know, she doesn't need

32:25.720 --> 32:29.560
this kind of problem, but so I slapped him

32:29.560 --> 32:33.430
and we had a fight and he hasn't
been home since last night.

32:33.430 --> 32:34.603
My mother's mad at me.

32:36.960 --> 32:39.480
I don't know what I would say to him,

32:39.480 --> 32:40.730
you know, when I see him.

32:44.020 --> 32:46.520
Well, what hurts is
that I feel responsible

32:47.670 --> 32:49.693
because I remember when he was a kid,

32:50.590 --> 32:54.840
he, uh, he busted me in the
same situation in the bathroom,

32:54.840 --> 32:57.750
you know, he saw me, threatened to tell

32:57.750 --> 33:00.797
but he didn't because he said
he loved me (chuckles softly).

33:02.360 --> 33:04.690
He thought his big sister was cool.

33:04.690 --> 33:09.410
Well, his big sister is not cool

33:09.410 --> 33:12.013
because his big sister is HIV positive.

33:14.340 --> 33:17.170
He knows, you know, I want him to stop,

33:17.170 --> 33:20.060
but he won't listen to me 'cause I'm, I'm,

33:20.060 --> 33:23.813
no example to listen to, you know.

33:27.630 --> 33:29.330
I'm not afraid of dying, you know.

33:32.040 --> 33:34.450
I'm afraid of getting sick
'cause I know what that's like.

33:34.450 --> 33:36.878
I seen some of my friends go through that

33:36.878 --> 33:39.150
and I don't wanna go
through that, you know?

33:39.150 --> 33:41.907
I want the cycle to end here, you know?

33:41.907 --> 33:43.593
I want it to end with me.

33:46.070 --> 33:47.950
I don't know how I got it,
you know, it could've been

33:47.950 --> 33:51.860
through sex, it could've been
through needles, who knows?

33:51.860 --> 33:53.270
It doesn't matter, you know, all I know

33:53.270 --> 33:57.590
is I keep thinking, you
know, why not have a drink

33:57.590 --> 34:00.800
when you got AIDS
(chuckles) right, you know?

34:00.800 --> 34:05.800
But that's just my
alcoholism talking, you know,

34:06.330 --> 34:11.092
looking for any excuse to
have a drink, you know?

34:12.870 --> 34:17.870
But the fact is I'm gonna die,
you know, so is everybody.

34:18.619 --> 34:21.452
(chuckles softly)

34:28.739 --> 34:31.583
(sniffles) I feel good,
you know, right now.

34:35.188 --> 34:40.188
(sniffles) And I wanna
watch my little girl

34:40.560 --> 34:45.560
grow up, and drinking's not
gonna cure me, you know?

34:45.850 --> 34:49.870
It's only gonna (sniffles)
make me die sooner,

34:49.870 --> 34:53.409
so I mean, you know, I
don't have time, you know,

34:53.409 --> 34:57.027
but, but (sniffles) you know, I do know

34:59.360 --> 35:02.933
that I wanna die sober,
that's it (chuckles softly).

35:16.550 --> 35:18.000
(thudding)

35:18.000 --> 35:21.473
- Tanya, oh, Tanya.

35:22.530 --> 35:24.913
Come on, you know who this is.

35:25.860 --> 35:28.373
It's your knight and shining vodka, baby.

35:29.240 --> 35:31.883
Tanya, come on, it's Jim, let me in.

35:32.870 --> 35:37.133
I'm in love with you again,
Tanya, come on, come on out.

35:38.000 --> 35:41.773
I'm having a party, Tanya, come on.

35:42.660 --> 35:45.690
Come on, I meant to call
you, but I lost your hallway,

35:45.690 --> 35:49.793
Tanya, honey, that's a joke, remember me?

35:50.992 --> 35:55.240
Oh, Tanya, Tanya (faint speaking).

36:02.051 --> 36:03.513
(answering machine beeping)

36:03.513 --> 36:06.144
- [Tony] Jimmy, Jimmy,
it's Tony, pick it up.

36:06.144 --> 36:08.652
Come on, pick it up, hey, listen.

36:08.652 --> 36:11.639
Do me a favor, want you to call 555-1234

36:11.639 --> 36:14.638
when you get in, it's the
phone booth in the hall.

36:14.638 --> 36:17.468
Just wanna know that
you're okay, all right?

36:17.468 --> 36:20.816
Okay, gave us a little surprise
there (faint speaking).

36:20.816 --> 36:24.864
(answering machine beeping)
(faint speaking)

36:24.864 --> 36:28.957
- [Shelley] You boob what did
you go running outta here for?

36:28.957 --> 36:30.957
- Come on, man, go.
- Go.

36:32.397 --> 36:35.040
- [Tony] People here love you,
man, I mean, but you know,

36:35.040 --> 36:37.516
I can't handle these whiners
without you, man, so come on.

36:37.516 --> 36:39.620
You gotta call.
- We love you.

36:39.620 --> 36:41.032
- We love you.
- Love you.

36:41.032 --> 36:44.640
Love you.
- Yeah, so call 555-1234,

36:44.640 --> 36:46.606
all right, Shelley's here.
- Bye-bye, bye-bye.

36:46.606 --> 36:48.022
- [Tony] Bye-bye.

36:48.022 --> 36:49.658
(answering machine beeps)

36:49.658 --> 36:53.658
(gulps)
(sighs)

36:57.330 --> 36:58.313
- Oh, shit.

36:59.961 --> 37:03.356
(glass rattles)
(exhales sharply)

37:03.356 --> 37:05.840
- You wanna talk about bad blackouts?

37:05.840 --> 37:07.830
I was married in one.
(woman laughs)

37:07.830 --> 37:09.840
I was married in a blackout, I'm serious.

37:09.840 --> 37:12.973
I was 19 years old, I was
married for six weeks, yeah.

37:12.973 --> 37:15.230
I was married to this guy named Wild Bob.

37:15.230 --> 37:17.920
That was his full name,
Wild Bob, so I guess

37:17.920 --> 37:20.734
I was Mrs. Wild Bob, hi
everyone, welcome to my life.

37:20.734 --> 37:24.010
(chuckles) Do you, Debbie, take Wild Bob

37:24.010 --> 37:26.083
to be your lawfully wedded husband, I do.

37:26.990 --> 37:28.400
Gawd, he was a rock musician

37:28.400 --> 37:30.910
like Gregg Allman, now what could I do?

37:30.910 --> 37:34.650
I'm a sucker for musicians,
yeah, so I've been in

37:34.650 --> 37:38.090
and out of these rooms about
four or five times now.

37:38.090 --> 37:41.880
I'd say it took me 2 1/2 years

37:41.880 --> 37:43.863
to get 90 days of sobriety.

37:45.410 --> 37:46.783
That's a lot of drinking.

37:47.900 --> 37:49.540
I don't know, I think I was pissed off

37:49.540 --> 37:52.670
that I didn't grow up
in the '60s and partied

37:52.670 --> 37:55.010
with Janis Joplin, you know what I mean?

37:55.010 --> 37:58.710
And everyone had that long
hair and the music was great,

37:58.710 --> 38:01.033
peace, love, the clothes, you know?

38:02.250 --> 38:05.633
You know what pisses
me, hi, hi, how are you?

38:06.500 --> 38:09.050
Good, great, you're late,
you know, I wanted to speak

38:09.050 --> 38:11.400
about this two weeks ago
and no one called on me

38:11.400 --> 38:14.380
and now, whatever, so what was I saying?

38:14.380 --> 38:18.720
I think what I was doing, I
was trying to relive the '60s

38:18.720 --> 38:22.800
in the '80s and it just didn't
work out for me, you know?

38:22.800 --> 38:25.700
I got stuck somewhere
in the middle, but gawd,

38:25.700 --> 38:29.890
I wanted to be Janis
Joplin so bad, so bad, man.

38:29.890 --> 38:33.663
She was great, she was so great, gawd.

38:34.880 --> 38:39.880
She was incredible, but
whatever, whatever I did, I did,

38:40.890 --> 38:45.890
you know, I had a good time
doing it and now, it's over.

38:46.900 --> 38:51.730
Oh my god (chuckles) I'm
so sad, no I'm strange.

38:51.730 --> 38:54.230
I'm a strange bird, I know, I'm weird.

38:54.230 --> 38:57.740
I've started doing physical
things to relieve the stress.

38:57.740 --> 39:00.453
I've gotten into sports
now, watching them.

39:01.290 --> 39:04.860
I love NFL football, I love NFL football.

39:04.860 --> 39:08.830
Jerry Rice of the 49ers, he is so great.

39:08.830 --> 39:12.820
He is so great, and Barry
Sanders, I love him.

39:12.820 --> 39:15.820
Gawd, he's great, I love watching football

39:15.820 --> 39:19.493
and I've become political for
the first time in my life.

39:19.493 --> 39:22.340
I went to the march in
Washington, the pro-choice march.

39:22.340 --> 39:25.580
It was exhilarating, Helen
Reddy sang I Am Woman.

39:25.580 --> 39:28.610
I freaked, I freaked, it was incredible.

39:28.610 --> 39:33.510
I swear, I'm such a dyke
sometimes, I'm such a dyke.

39:33.510 --> 39:36.330
You know, I mean I'm
not attracted to women,

39:36.330 --> 39:39.950
but I feel like politically
that I could be a lesbian,

39:39.950 --> 39:43.670
you know, that whatever, but
yeah, the march was great.

39:43.670 --> 39:45.130
The march was really great, I think it was

39:45.130 --> 39:47.470
like the closest thing that I ever got

39:47.470 --> 39:50.120
to living in the '60s, you know?

39:50.120 --> 39:52.190
And I met some people in these rooms

39:52.190 --> 39:54.620
who were active drinkers
and users in the '60s

39:54.620 --> 39:57.550
and they said that all that peace and love

39:57.550 --> 40:01.410
that they were looking
for and, and, whatever,

40:01.410 --> 40:05.403
hoping to find, that they
found in these rooms.

40:06.310 --> 40:08.060
I think I know what they mean, you know,

40:08.060 --> 40:09.943
I see what they mean, I mean I can,

40:12.010 --> 40:14.710
I could be the Janis Joplin

40:14.710 --> 40:18.163
of the Holiday Inn circuit if I want to.

40:20.010 --> 40:22.960
If I want to, I'll just be
her clean and sober, you know?

41:42.380 --> 41:46.460
of a record store with
seven CDs in his backpack

41:47.862 --> 41:52.862
and Steven's 12 now and he
has a record of misdemeanors.

41:53.870 --> 41:56.150
His therapist, who's known
him since he was six,

41:56.150 --> 42:00.150
and whose children I think
I've put through school

42:00.150 --> 42:03.160
several times (chuckles)

42:03.160 --> 42:06.480
thinks that maybe he should
go live with his father.

42:06.480 --> 42:08.040
I'm scared out of my mind

42:08.040 --> 42:11.223
that if Steven moves out that I'll drink.

42:12.400 --> 42:15.530
When I got sober, I made
a secret vow to myself.

42:15.530 --> 42:19.450
I promised myself that I would stay sober

42:19.450 --> 42:23.193
as long as Steven was there and I did.

42:24.400 --> 42:26.773
One day at a time, I did, you know?

42:29.230 --> 42:32.140
But there's a wall calendar
(chuckles) in my head

42:35.090 --> 42:40.090
with, um, very big red letters, it says:

42:40.380 --> 42:43.933
when he leaves, you can drink.

42:45.864 --> 42:49.620
You know, I used my, I
used my boy, I used him

42:49.620 --> 42:52.480
to (chuckles) hang on to
my husband, I used him

42:52.480 --> 42:54.660
to stay sane when I was I was drinking.

42:54.660 --> 42:59.193
I used him to get sober and stay sober.

43:01.710 --> 43:02.653
What about him?

43:08.924 --> 43:13.341
You know (scoffs) he was life to me.

43:15.795 --> 43:18.880
And I'd come home and I'd
feel his warmth and I,

43:21.360 --> 43:26.020
it'd take away some of the
emptiness that I felt (sighs)

43:28.129 --> 43:31.440
(chuckles) I could read
him a nursery rhyme

43:31.440 --> 43:33.290
or I could cuddle with him, you know.

43:37.400 --> 43:40.273
The trouble was that I was drunk,

43:42.190 --> 43:44.680
you know, four-year-old
boy cuddling every night

43:45.820 --> 43:46.963
with a drunken mother.

43:51.128 --> 43:52.460
I remember him sitting
at the kitchen table,

43:52.460 --> 43:54.800
you know, me coming
in, guzzling big bottle

43:58.160 --> 43:59.313
and his face,

44:03.133 --> 44:05.133
you know, his face (chuckles
softly) looking at me,

44:07.465 --> 44:08.615
I knew it wasn't right.

44:12.970 --> 44:15.500
Even after all this
time, I find it so hard,

44:15.500 --> 44:17.453
so hard to accept this.

44:18.350 --> 44:22.320
I mean why, why do I have to be powerless.

44:22.320 --> 44:23.433
Why do I have to?

44:26.804 --> 44:29.320
(sighs) Why do I got to go
to AA to tell me how to be

44:29.320 --> 44:33.583
with my son, you know, it's
an instinct for Christ's sake!

44:36.890 --> 44:38.517

45:11.870 --> 45:16.870
How can I be of service to him?

45:20.770 --> 45:22.820
I think I'll ask him what he wants to do.

45:25.727 --> 45:27.077
What a concept (chuckles softly).

45:30.320 --> 45:31.973
If it would be better for him,

50:16.030 --> 50:19.163
- I'm working 18 hours a day.

50:21.440 --> 50:24.470
Most nights, I just sleep
on the sofa in my office,

50:24.470 --> 50:28.810
but, um, last night,
I, I wanted to go home

50:28.810 --> 50:33.810
and um, so I left the
hospital about 2:00 a.m.

50:35.960 --> 50:38.440
And I walked across the
parking lot to my car

50:39.780 --> 50:44.780
and um, I got in the car and
um, the next thing I know,

50:44.820 --> 50:49.820
a policeman is rapping
on the window saying,

50:52.347 --> 50:54.637
"Let me see your license, let
me see your registration, what

50:54.637 --> 50:58.137
"are you doing in the parking
lot at 4:30 in the morning?"

50:59.180 --> 51:03.450
I was freezing cold, I
just sort of felt numb

51:03.450 --> 51:07.430
and I couldn't think and I couldn't talk

51:09.350 --> 51:14.350
and uh, flashlight, you know,

51:14.820 --> 51:18.420
searching the car and looking
at me and finally, he noticed

51:18.420 --> 51:22.990
the sticker on my windshield, he said,

51:22.990 --> 51:25.946
"Are you a doctor at this hospital?"

51:25.946 --> 51:30.946
(chuckles) I said, yep, that's it,

51:31.200 --> 51:33.290
that's what I'm doing here, I said, yeah,

51:33.290 --> 51:35.080
that I was a doctor at this hospital.

51:35.080 --> 51:38.323
I've been working long hours
and I fallen asleep in the car.

51:41.850 --> 51:43.390
He walked me back to the hospital

51:43.390 --> 51:45.750
and then gave me a long
lecture on the danger

51:45.750 --> 51:49.070
of parking lots and get some coffee

51:49.070 --> 51:53.200
and get some sleep, so I
was sitting in my office

51:55.919 --> 52:00.919
this morning and I was thinking a lot

52:01.410 --> 52:05.030
about the last time I passed out in a car

52:06.240 --> 52:09.143
and I thought of this man here, Joseph,

52:10.660 --> 52:12.960
because I had two kids in the back.

52:12.960 --> 52:15.527
I wasn't driving, I just passed out

52:15.527 --> 52:18.360
but the windows were rolled
up and the car was locked

52:18.360 --> 52:22.320
and the kids were screaming
and it was sweltering hot

52:22.320 --> 52:25.127
and the people who heard
the kids couldn't wake me up

52:25.127 --> 52:29.753
and the police woke me up that time too.

52:33.820 --> 52:37.660
I, uh, turned myself into
the hospital and I told them

52:37.660 --> 52:40.590
that I had been stealing
Demirel from my patients

52:40.590 --> 52:44.760
for about two years and I had always been

52:44.760 --> 52:46.333
a big scotch drinker.

52:48.700 --> 52:51.490
In the hospital, put me
in detox and they put me

52:51.490 --> 52:55.790
in rehab and they put
me in a halfway house

52:55.790 --> 52:59.200
with other doctors like me

53:00.430 --> 53:02.620
and then they took me back.

53:02.620 --> 53:05.540
They put me on probation
but they took me back

53:05.540 --> 53:09.923
to the hospital and I worked,
I worked, I worked, I worked.

53:12.970 --> 53:17.600
I stayed straight, stayed clean,

53:17.600 --> 53:22.600
I stayed sober and I worked.

53:24.960 --> 53:28.850
Now, I was thinking that I lost

53:30.250 --> 53:32.750
my children and I lost my husband,

53:32.750 --> 53:36.440
I lost my home (exhales sharply)

53:37.870 --> 53:39.613
but I've always had my work.

53:41.310 --> 53:45.450
It's never let me down, but this morning,

53:45.450 --> 53:49.480
I was thinking about the similarity

53:49.480 --> 53:54.150
between what my life is now

53:55.950 --> 53:59.910
as a well-respected doctor

54:01.020 --> 54:05.180
and what my life was then and it came

54:06.130 --> 54:10.143
sort of clear to me that
I have isolated myself,

54:11.120 --> 54:16.120
um, in this crowd of doctors
and crowd of patients

54:18.730 --> 54:22.350
who were always needing me (sighs)

54:22.350 --> 54:25.840
that I've isolated myself the same way

54:25.840 --> 54:30.840
as I used to do when I was
taking Demirel and scotch

54:33.580 --> 54:36.543
and then I thought to myself,
you know, why would I do this?

54:37.600 --> 54:39.393
Why would I do this?

54:41.170 --> 54:44.300
And then I thought to myself,
well, I think the reason

54:44.300 --> 54:49.273
is because I have not done the work of AA.

54:52.630 --> 54:57.630
I have not done the thing of looking

54:59.390 --> 55:01.263
at how I blew up my life.

55:06.710 --> 55:11.710
And um, I guess that's why I'm here

55:12.140 --> 55:16.420
because I need help to get back

55:17.740 --> 55:22.040
to my sponsor and I need
help to get back home

55:24.440 --> 55:29.440
to my home group and I
need to do the real work,

55:30.150 --> 55:32.863
the real work, which I had never done.

57:43.360 --> 57:44.840
Does Mother Teresa hang here too?

57:44.840 --> 57:47.560
I knew she drank.
(chuckles softly)

57:47.560 --> 57:51.980
Thank you, okay, here is to everyone

57:53.370 --> 57:55.860
and fuck everything.

57:55.860 --> 57:56.810
- No good (laughs).

58:00.310 --> 58:04.530
- I, um, feel like I should say
something, I (clears throat)

58:04.530 --> 58:07.790
my name is Louis Tingley and I'm not,

58:07.790 --> 58:09.490
I don't, I think I'm an alcoholic.

58:10.702 --> 58:14.293
I'm, I'm stunned, actually, by this.

58:15.154 --> 58:17.254
I came to this church for a choir practice

58:18.412 --> 58:21.730
and when I came, I guess I
was a bit fuzzy on the dates.

58:21.730 --> 58:26.730
No one was there, so it was
only second, second time,

58:26.730 --> 58:30.070
so my eyesight isn't the
greatest and I wandered downhill

58:30.070 --> 58:34.030
looking for the men's
room and well, I thought

58:34.030 --> 58:37.320
all of you were the choir taking
a break at first, you see,

58:37.320 --> 58:39.160
and I got drawn into the stories.

58:39.160 --> 58:42.000
I have to say, I've never, they're so real

58:42.000 --> 58:46.270
and honest, they're, they're,
I mean nothing compares

58:46.270 --> 58:48.660
to it on television or in most movies.

58:48.660 --> 58:51.240
I got pulled in and I
thought, my god, I had no idea

58:51.240 --> 58:54.573
that the choir had so many problems.

58:54.573 --> 58:57.750
(group chuckles)
And then the more I listened

58:57.750 --> 58:59.040
to your stories, the more I realize

58:59.040 --> 59:02.010
that, uh, well, I'm really not a drunk.

59:02.010 --> 59:07.010
I'm not a sober either, I'm,
I'm, I guess I'm a fuzzy.

59:09.070 --> 59:11.860
That's what I'd call
it, I drink to get fuzzy

59:11.860 --> 59:14.423
and I like getting fuzzy every day.

59:15.310 --> 59:17.210
It's not that I don't
don't know what sober is.

59:17.210 --> 59:19.800
I mean I come from New England,
I come from a long line

59:19.800 --> 59:23.610
of sober people, when
they're drunk, they're sober.

59:23.610 --> 59:25.710
Most of them are a
little drunk every night

59:25.710 --> 59:29.153
after five, but I have to say, um,

59:30.620 --> 59:34.173
I will be honest, I
admit it, I'm a hophead.

59:36.000 --> 59:39.470
I like beer, sometimes boilermakers,

59:39.470 --> 59:42.540
you know, one or two shots
Irish, not on the side,

59:42.540 --> 59:45.120
but I like to drop the
shot right into the mug

59:45.120 --> 59:49.353
and watch it boil and foam up.

59:50.503 --> 59:53.190
And if there's a higher
power, I can't believe

59:53.190 --> 59:56.036
that higher power didn't
create barley and hops

59:56.036 --> 59:58.680
and allow them to sit there and ferment

59:59.880 --> 01:00:03.500
and God created beer, but not light beer.

01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:05.380
(group laughs)

01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:08.190
It's the devil's work or man's work.

01:00:08.190 --> 01:00:10.510
Actually, I grew up with the
Bible, you wouldn't believe it.

01:00:10.510 --> 01:00:13.130
My mother read the Bible
to me and I like that.

01:00:13.130 --> 01:00:14.860
I remember that stuff in the Bible.

01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:17.840
There is a season for
everything under heaven

01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:21.440
and a time and I think
there's a time for drinking,

01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:26.440
you know, every day between
five and 10:00 or six and 11:00,

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:30.540
but I never drink alone,
no, I drink at the,

01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:32.480
around the corner at the Pegasus.

01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:36.010
They have, gawd, I think they
have seven draft beers there,

01:00:36.010 --> 01:00:38.873
including the queen of
beers, the Guinness Stout,

01:00:40.244 --> 01:00:43.730
but you see, it's so
nice to have an activity

01:00:43.730 --> 01:00:46.890
to keep me away, to celebrate, like I,

01:00:46.890 --> 01:00:49.250
that's part of why I'm staying
here, why I wanted to go

01:00:49.250 --> 01:00:51.140
to choir practice, I
needed something, you know,

01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:55.650
like in the Bible or in
the beer ads on television,

01:00:55.650 --> 01:00:57.960
we've had a great ballgame,

01:00:57.960 --> 01:01:00.530
now let's have a cold one to celebrate.

01:01:00.530 --> 01:01:02.513
A cold one is a euphemism, I guess.

01:01:02.513 --> 01:01:04.760
I don't imagine having one beer.

01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:07.260
I can't imagine anyone
just drinking one beer

01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:10.990
if it was any good, what am I saying?

01:01:10.990 --> 01:01:13.270
Everyone's quiet, I'm
thrown back on myself.

01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:18.100
Perhaps I'm saying that I need
like an objective constraint

01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:21.490
outside of myself to
stop me from, you know,

01:01:21.490 --> 01:01:25.350
like in the case of the
choir, a singing super ego

01:01:25.350 --> 01:01:28.180
to stop me from rushing off to the bar

01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:29.630
and then I'll have something to celebrate.

01:01:29.630 --> 01:01:33.960
I, I, I, what I'm saying, I think,

01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:37.273
is that I prefer your
narratives to their hymns.

01:01:38.570 --> 01:01:41.900
I'd like to come here every
night and listen to stories

01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:46.900
and tell stories, I really
never talked like this before.

01:01:50.060 --> 01:01:52.870
You see, what I wanted to
ask if I could stay on here

01:01:52.870 --> 01:01:55.880
is, well, I know you're
supposed to be special

01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:58.360
and I do have that feeling, I wanted to be

01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:00.930
a nondrinking drinker, I'm
not drinking now, you see.

01:02:00.930 --> 01:02:04.483
I don't have any, it's,
I don't, it's not on me,

01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:08.510
but I will drink, I will, after I leave

01:02:08.510 --> 01:02:10.070
this special occasion, I will go

01:02:10.070 --> 01:02:12.010
onto the next special
occasion around the corner,

01:02:12.010 --> 01:02:16.240
the Pegasus, and watch
Henry pour a slow draft

01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:20.890
of Double Diamond and watch
its amber head foam up

01:02:20.890 --> 01:02:25.440
and lift it to my lips and
feel its foam on my mustache

01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:30.270
and slide down like liquid bread

01:02:31.408 --> 01:02:33.550
and then to bed and...

01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:42.453
but thank you for letting me talk.

01:02:45.570 --> 01:02:48.403
I'm, I didn't,

01:02:49.930 --> 01:02:52.173

01:02:54.100 --> 01:02:57.103

before I went to those fucking places.

now, more than anything

wanna do is I wanna drink.

wanna drink, I wanna drink

01:07:00.460 --> 01:07:02.433

hate to tell you this,

01:07:37.270 --> 01:07:40.880
but it helped me, you
know, I only had one.

01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:44.320
I didn't black out, but I
needed that one to just get me

01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:46.220
through it, you know, to calm me down.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.170
And I don't think

01:07:52.470 --> 01:07:55.930
anybody can really understand me for that.

See, uh, I was gonna go out
and I was gonna get drunk

01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:09.630
tonight but, you know, I had
this plan, but for some reason,

01:08:09.630 --> 01:08:13.500
I came here and I guess I'm here

01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:15.820
because I really want somebody to stop me

01:08:18.319 --> 01:08:21.542
because I just can't do it.

01:08:30.729 --> 01:08:34.202
You know, don't fucking
stare at me like that,

01:08:34.202 --> 01:08:36.510
all right, because I do not need

01:08:36.510 --> 01:08:40.212
your goddamn pity.
(group muttering)

01:08:48.466 --> 01:08:51.966
(smooth jazz piano music)

01:09:02.542 --> 01:09:03.376
- Hello.

01:09:07.291 --> 01:09:10.354
You know where Felix is?

01:09:10.354 --> 01:09:13.029
Did you see, you know who Felix is?

01:09:13.029 --> 01:09:13.930
Did you see Felix?

01:09:17.566 --> 01:09:18.810
(mumbles)

01:09:18.810 --> 01:09:20.273
Oh, all right.

01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:26.051
- [Man] Yeah, what's up, homes?

01:09:26.051 --> 01:09:28.870
- You see Felix?
- Felix who?

01:09:28.870 --> 01:09:30.410
- [Jim] You don't know who Felix is?

01:09:30.410 --> 01:09:33.819
- I said Felix who, right,
I say, home, you sure

01:09:33.819 --> 01:09:35.256
I can't help you out
with (faint speaking)?

01:09:36.836 --> 01:09:37.669
You sure?

01:09:43.390 --> 01:09:48.390
- Excuse me, princess, oh,
Jesus fuck, oh, honey pie.

01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:52.750
- Yeah, baby.
- You know where Felix is?

01:09:52.750 --> 01:09:55.690
- Yeah, Felix got busted last
week, he's in Rikers now.

01:09:55.690 --> 01:09:57.280
- Oh.
- Unfortunately.

01:09:57.280 --> 01:09:58.817
- He's in Rikers?
- Yeah.

01:09:58.817 --> 01:09:59.863
- Oh, fuck!

01:10:01.195 --> 01:10:04.028
(exhales sharply)

01:10:05.468 --> 01:10:08.920
(door creaking)

01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:11.857
- [Woman] Before I came to
these rooms, I was afraid

01:10:13.634 --> 01:10:16.587
(faint speaking) I was
afraid of my own shadow.

01:10:16.587 --> 01:10:19.807
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.

01:10:20.935 --> 01:10:24.307
I feel like a jerk (scoffs)
I'm sorry I acted out.

01:10:27.260 --> 01:10:31.127
- You know, you said you
wanted us to stop you.

01:10:32.995 --> 01:10:34.113
We can't stop you.

01:10:35.150 --> 01:10:36.660
- Yeah, I know.

01:10:36.660 --> 01:10:39.263
- We can help you, but we can't stop you.

01:10:41.310 --> 01:10:43.723
Been making meetings?
- Yeah.

01:10:46.660 --> 01:10:50.430
- (chuckles softly) Got a sponsor?

01:10:50.430 --> 01:10:53.130
- Yeah, I have a sponsor, I have an idiot

01:10:53.130 --> 01:10:55.053
for a sponsor, I have myself.

01:10:55.970 --> 01:11:00.413
- You can't sponsor
yourself, that's my number.

01:11:02.010 --> 01:11:03.710
Instead of picking up a
drink, pick up the phone

01:11:03.710 --> 01:11:04.543
and call me.

01:11:07.660 --> 01:11:09.683
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:13.393
- Thanks.

01:11:27.481 --> 01:11:32.398
Look at you, you're so together,
you're so fucking perfect.

01:11:35.660 --> 01:11:37.850
- I'm just a garden-variety drunk

01:11:40.456 --> 01:11:42.427
and in one day, same as you.

01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:51.460
- Oh gawd (chuckles) look
at me, I look like shit.

01:11:51.460 --> 01:11:53.313
- No, you (chuckles) you look fine.

01:11:53.313 --> 01:11:56.440
I mean, listen, mirrors,
you can't trust this mirror

01:11:56.440 --> 01:12:01.440
and these lights (laughs) no,
make everybody look horrible.

01:12:01.820 --> 01:12:05.410
Squint, you look beautiful,
try it, come on, squint.

01:12:05.410 --> 01:12:07.290
Say, I look fabulous.

01:12:07.290 --> 01:12:08.190
- I look fabulous.

01:12:09.829 --> 01:12:13.197
- You look fabulous.
- You look fabulous.

01:12:13.197 --> 01:12:15.484
- We look fabulous.

01:12:15.484 --> 01:12:20.484
(cars whooshing)
(steps crunching)

01:12:36.644 --> 01:12:40.227
(dogs barking in distance)

01:12:41.410 --> 01:12:44.827
(disjointed piano music)

01:13:11.470 --> 01:13:13.387
- Do I put money in for this or?

01:13:13.387 --> 01:13:16.114
- No, no, no, no, this is free.

01:13:16.114 --> 01:13:18.010
- Oh.
- Yeah, free.

01:13:18.010 --> 01:13:19.910
- You know, actually not an alcoholic.

01:13:20.833 --> 01:13:22.931
- Yeah, you said that.
- So I don't know if I--

01:13:22.931 --> 01:13:24.390
- Would you like some?

01:13:24.390 --> 01:13:25.833
- It's all right to--
- Yeah.

01:13:27.302 --> 01:13:29.228
'Cause it's just tea.

01:13:29.228 --> 01:13:30.928
- Oh, of course.
(Jasmine laughing)

01:13:30.928 --> 01:13:32.805
Well, I'll be having beer afterwards--

01:13:32.805 --> 01:13:34.110
- Right.
- As I said at the meeting.

01:13:34.110 --> 01:13:36.310
- So you want it or not?
- What?

01:13:36.310 --> 01:13:37.680
- The tea.
- Oh, yeah.

01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:39.949
- Okay.
- Make it herbal, it's fine.

01:13:39.949 --> 01:13:42.030
- All right, now--
- Something different.

01:13:42.030 --> 01:13:43.830
I haven't had that since I was a hippie.

01:13:43.830 --> 01:13:46.780
I like it at night though 'cause
I don't like to get wired.

01:13:47.850 --> 01:13:48.683
That's--
- Here.

01:13:48.683 --> 01:13:51.330
- Oh, thank you.
- Keep coming back, okay?

01:13:51.330 --> 01:13:53.460
- For tea? (chuckles)
- At meetings.

01:13:53.460 --> 01:13:54.793
- Oh, oh, meeting, yeah.

01:13:56.140 --> 01:13:59.320
- I'd like to thank you
all for being here tonight

01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:03.380
because I needed you,
okay, I'd like to end

01:14:03.380 --> 01:14:07.090
the meeting with, yes?

01:14:07.090 --> 01:14:12.090
- Hi, uh, my name is Kathy
and I'm an alcoholic.

01:14:13.620 --> 01:14:14.570
- [Group] Hi Kathy.

01:14:15.420 --> 01:14:17.120
- I came here tonight because, um,

01:14:18.470 --> 01:14:23.230
not knowing if I was, um, you
know, an alcoholic and stuff

01:14:23.230 --> 01:14:25.693
but, uh, after listening to all of you,

01:14:27.130 --> 01:14:28.430
I'm pretty sure that I am

01:14:29.930 --> 01:14:34.810
or, uh, I think we've done

01:14:34.810 --> 01:14:37.170
a hell of a lot of the same things,

01:14:37.170 --> 01:14:41.150
like blackouts and
everything and, um, or felt

01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:45.950
a lot of the same way or something.

01:14:45.950 --> 01:14:48.293
We, um, we definitely drink a lot.

01:14:49.930 --> 01:14:54.013
I, uh, I came here tonight because, um,

01:14:58.260 --> 01:14:59.810
I didn't know where else to go.

01:15:01.100 --> 01:15:04.970
I don't really have
friends because I drink.

01:15:04.970 --> 01:15:09.970
I don't, I don't have
a home because I drink.

01:15:10.780 --> 01:15:15.780
I, uh, I live in a
women's shelter and, uh,

01:15:17.270 --> 01:15:22.270
and I'm pregnant and I don't
know what I'm going to do,

01:15:24.190 --> 01:15:27.710
but I know that, um, that
I need to stop drinking

01:15:28.870 --> 01:15:30.470
and I wanna be able to keep the baby

01:15:30.470 --> 01:15:34.943
because I have so much inside me, I just,

01:15:36.190 --> 01:15:40.633
I just need someone to give
it to, that's why I'm here.

01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:45.143
The father, he left.

01:15:47.264 --> 01:15:50.333
I woke up and he was gone, that hurts.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.602
I was sleeping in a car, he drinks.

01:15:57.602 --> 01:15:59.680
I was, um, I was sleeping in doorways

01:16:00.650 --> 01:16:03.970
and I don't want my baby like
that but it's like I keep

01:16:03.970 --> 01:16:05.700
drinking with any money that I get,

01:16:05.700 --> 01:16:09.513
I can help it and I need help.

01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:13.073
I'm scared.

01:16:16.210 --> 01:16:20.450
But um, who knows, I mean I'm here tonight

01:16:22.420 --> 01:16:25.970
and, um, I don't really
like to talk because I know

01:16:25.970 --> 01:16:27.233
that I don't talk right.

01:16:30.190 --> 01:16:31.023
I'm done.

01:16:33.710 --> 01:16:36.510
- Kathy, all you have to have to come here

01:16:36.510 --> 01:16:40.133
is a desire to stop drinking
and you've got that, okay?

01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:43.730
I don't know what's gonna happen to me.

01:16:43.730 --> 01:16:45.800
This meeting hasn't
given me all the answers,

01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:49.593
but I know when I'm here, I won't drink,

01:16:52.629 --> 01:16:57.629
Okay, all right, let's end
the meeting with a moment

01:16:58.020 --> 01:17:00.430
of silence for those
still sick and suffering,

01:17:00.430 --> 01:17:03.240
both outside and the other rooms,

01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:05.407
followed by the Serenity Prayer.

01:17:11.203 --> 01:17:12.890
- God.
- God.

01:17:12.890 --> 01:17:16.012
- [Group] God, grant me
the serenity to accept

01:17:16.012 --> 01:17:19.753
the things I cannot change,
the courage to change

01:17:19.753 --> 01:17:24.753
the things I can and the
wisdom to know the difference.

01:17:25.015 --> 01:17:28.503
Keep coming back, it works if you work it,

01:17:28.503 --> 01:17:31.403
so work it, you're worth it.

01:17:31.403 --> 01:17:34.153
(group clapping)

01:17:39.951 --> 01:17:44.951
- You wanna get a coffee?
- Yeah, a coffee sounds good.

01:17:45.226 --> 01:17:48.798
- You wanna hit the diner?
- Yeah (faint speaking).

01:17:48.798 --> 01:17:52.529
- [Woman] Jasmine, Jasmine, Jasmine?

01:17:52.529 --> 01:17:53.799
- Yeah?
- I'll walk (faint speaking).

01:17:53.799 --> 01:17:55.589
- [Jasmine] Oh, okay, okay.

01:17:55.589 --> 01:17:58.506
(group chattering)

01:18:00.284 --> 01:18:04.951
- [Man] Yeah, yeah, I (faint speaking).

01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:08.891
- [Man] You know, why don't you
stop fucking lying about it?

01:18:08.891 --> 01:18:11.724

01:20:02.550 --> 01:20:03.663
I'm a hero.

01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:10.240
I stopped drinking and I become,

01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:15.240
oh, I become the ideal
fucking husband for two years

01:20:15.730 --> 01:20:19.183
and my beautiful darling Janie, I am,

01:20:20.703 --> 01:20:25.150
like Father Knows Best, man,
I mean I'm talking breakfast

01:20:25.150 --> 01:20:30.150
in bed, kisses on the Staten Island Ferry.

01:20:30.273 --> 01:20:33.145
Oh, I did it all, you know?

01:20:33.145 --> 01:20:38.143
(chuckles softly) And
then the little lady dies.

01:20:41.024 --> 01:20:43.063
Poor Jimmy Epstein.

01:20:43.970 --> 01:20:48.810
Pity the poor sober martyr.

01:20:48.810 --> 01:20:49.643
Huh, huh?

01:20:53.010 --> 01:20:54.310
That's what I told myself.

01:20:56.610 --> 01:20:58.383
It is a lie.

01:20:59.670 --> 01:21:04.670
I mean I didn't drink, but I
didn't know who the fuck I was.

01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:07.420
I didn't know who the fuck she was.

01:21:07.420 --> 01:21:09.460
I didn't even know what to say to her.

01:21:09.460 --> 01:21:12.530
I mean I had to just, I was
just sorta hanging around.

01:21:12.530 --> 01:21:17.530
I was just staring at her with
this blank fucking expression

01:21:18.940 --> 01:21:22.957
All I was thinking about was
drinking (chuckles softly).

01:21:24.530 --> 01:21:26.536
- That can't be true, man,
I mean you turned your life

01:21:26.536 --> 01:21:28.100
around, she must've been proud of you.

01:21:28.100 --> 01:21:30.340
- Oh, don't tell me what
was true, what was true.

01:21:30.340 --> 01:21:34.800
It was too goddamn late, I
mean I turned into a ghost,

01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:37.940
come on, I mean I
might've been sober, okay,

01:21:37.940 --> 01:21:39.980
but I tell you something, I was sober,

01:21:39.980 --> 01:21:42.900
but we had two of the most painful,

01:21:42.900 --> 01:21:47.413
empty slow years anyone could ever have.

01:21:50.370 --> 01:21:52.500
We never connected

01:21:54.228 --> 01:21:58.673
and that was so fucking true
that you couldn't even say it.

01:22:00.310 --> 01:22:01.433
We were a hoax.

01:22:03.890 --> 01:22:06.900
I couldn't even help her
'cause I didn't even know
