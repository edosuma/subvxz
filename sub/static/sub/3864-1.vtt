00:15.524 --> 00:16.816
Quiet on the set.

00:18.194 --> 00:21.029
- Okay, everybody, quiet on the set.
- Scene 1, Take 10, marker.

00:27.745 --> 00:30.955
And action.

00:32.791 --> 00:34.417
Joel Levison's office.

00:34.627 --> 00:37.921
No, I'm sorry, he's not in yet.
May I take a message?

00:38.172 --> 00:40.798
- Yes, I'll tell him you called.
- Sandy, never say that.

00:41.008 --> 00:44.177
He's either in conference, in a meeting.
He's always in.

00:44.428 --> 00:47.430
- Now, who was that?
- A Larry Levy?

00:48.098 --> 00:50.350
I hope there was nothing
in the trades. Was there?

00:50.559 --> 00:51.976
I don't know. The mail's late.

00:52.186 --> 00:54.270
- Well, go get them. Now!
- Yes, ma'am.

00:54.438 --> 00:57.649
I want them back here
before he arrives.

01:12.456 --> 01:14.499
Griffin. Griffin, hi.

01:14.708 --> 01:17.627
Adam Simon. I know we're
not supposed to meet till next week...

01:17.795 --> 01:20.338
...but a lot of heat...
- Didn't realize we were meeting.

01:20.506 --> 01:23.007
I wanted to plant the seed
in your head just so that...

01:23.217 --> 01:24.926
I'm booked up. I can't hear a pitch.

01:25.094 --> 01:28.221
Picture this. It's a planet in
the far, far future with two suns.

01:28.389 --> 01:30.640
- Who plays the sons?
- No, suns. Large solar disks.

01:30.808 --> 01:32.684
You gotta run this idea
by Bonnie Sherow.

01:32.851 --> 01:36.020
Pictures they make these days
are all MTV. Cut, cut, cut, cut.

01:36.188 --> 01:39.816
The opening shot of Welles' Touch of Evil
was six and a half minutes long.

01:39.984 --> 01:41.192
Six and a half minutes, Walter?

01:41.402 --> 01:45.488
Well, three or four. Anyway, he set up the
whole picture with that one tracking shot.

01:45.656 --> 01:47.865
My father was the key grip on that shoot.

01:48.033 --> 01:52.036
Hey, what about Absolute Beginners?
Man, that was an extraordinary shot.

01:52.204 --> 01:55.540
- What was that? Never heard of it.
- Julien Temple. It's an English film.

01:55.708 --> 01:58.001
- Morning.
- We're talking about American movies...

01:58.168 --> 01:59.711
...and Orson Welles was a master.

01:59.920 --> 02:02.839
- Can I have a Pellegrino, please?
- I've got Calistoga.

02:03.007 --> 02:05.091
- Hi, Buck, how are you?
- Good, how you doing?

02:05.259 --> 02:09.512
- Good. What do you got for me?
- Okay, here it is.

02:09.680 --> 02:12.515
- The Graduate Part Two.
- Oh, good, good.

02:12.683 --> 02:15.518
Now, listen.
The three principals are still with us.

02:15.686 --> 02:18.688
Dustin Hoffman, Anne Bancroft,
Katharine Ross.

02:18.856 --> 02:19.856
Mm-hm.

02:20.024 --> 02:23.359
Twenty-five years later,
and so are the characters.

02:23.569 --> 02:26.195
Ben, Elaine and Mrs. Robinson.

02:26.405 --> 02:28.197
Ben and Elaine are married still.

02:28.365 --> 02:32.827
They live in a big, old, spooky house
up in northern California somewhere...

02:33.037 --> 02:35.538
...and Mrs. Robinson lives with them.

02:35.706 --> 02:40.043
- Mm.
- Her aging mother, who's had a stroke...

02:40.210 --> 02:42.754
- Mrs. Robinson's had a stroke?
- Had a stroke, so she can't talk.

02:42.921 --> 02:44.756
- Is this gonna be funny?
- Yeah, it'll be funny.

02:44.923 --> 02:47.258
Dark, and weird, and funny
and with a stroke.

02:47.426 --> 02:48.968
- Okay.
- Maybe it's not a stroke.

02:49.178 --> 02:51.304
- Maybe it's... I don't know what it is.
- Anyway, go on.

02:51.472 --> 02:52.805
- It's a malady of some sort.
- Okay.

02:52.973 --> 02:56.225
She's up there in the bedroom upstairs,
listening to everything that happens.

02:56.393 --> 02:59.103
They've got a daughter
who's just graduated from college.

02:59.313 --> 03:01.564
- Young blood.
- Twenty-two, 23-year-old.

03:01.732 --> 03:03.441
- Like a Julia Roberts.
- Julia Roberts. Great.

03:03.651 --> 03:04.734
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

03:04.902 --> 03:07.862
- What do I do with these scripts?
- Uh, that goes to Bonnie Sherow.

03:08.030 --> 03:11.199
And, uh, find out from studio security
how Adam Simon got on the lot.

03:11.367 --> 03:14.243
- I wanna know.
- Okay. Adam Simon? Okay.

03:14.411 --> 03:16.579
- Okay? Julia Roberts comes home.
- Yes, go ahead.

03:16.747 --> 03:18.164
Their daughter, the graduate.

03:18.332 --> 03:20.500
- And she brings her...
- The new graduate.

03:20.668 --> 03:22.877
Griffin loved it.
He wanted me to run it by you.

03:23.045 --> 03:26.172
A band of human survivors,
generations removed from the mother ship.

03:26.340 --> 03:29.008
They have no history.
They've lost their technological knowledge.

03:29.176 --> 03:31.678
I can't process this.
Could you write it down?

03:31.845 --> 03:33.513
It's not about words, it's about pictures.

03:36.100 --> 03:37.225
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, man.

03:38.185 --> 03:41.104
Jimmy? Jimmy, are you okay?

03:41.313 --> 03:43.648
- What happened?
- Twenty-five words or less?

03:43.857 --> 03:44.899
Are you all right?

03:45.067 --> 03:46.901
I'd like to say, my name is Jimmy Chase.

03:47.069 --> 03:49.112
You all right? Open your eyes. You okay?

03:49.279 --> 03:51.823
He just came out of nowhere,
ran right into the car.

03:51.990 --> 03:54.200
- Take it slow.
- It's okay.

03:55.577 --> 03:56.994
Yeah, it's okay.

03:57.162 --> 03:58.913
Hey. Hey, that's Adam Simon.

03:59.081 --> 04:01.207
How you doing, kid? I just had a meeting.

04:01.375 --> 04:02.959
- You all right?
- It was good.

04:03.127 --> 04:05.044
- Yeah, yeah.
- You sure you're okay?

04:09.717 --> 04:12.510
Rebecca De Mornay.
Actually, you're much better looking.

04:12.678 --> 04:14.595
- As a matter of fact, we...
- Um, no.

04:14.763 --> 04:16.471
- I'm not Rebecca De Mornay.
- Dead ringer.

04:16.640 --> 04:17.890
Thank you. Thank you very much.

04:18.058 --> 04:20.601
You know where Joel Levison's office is?

04:20.769 --> 04:23.354
The Mr. Levison, head of the studio? Yeah.

04:23.522 --> 04:25.773
But it's quite moving.
It'll rip your heart out.

04:25.941 --> 04:30.278
This is the area where we make decisions
to give a green light to a picture like that.

04:30.446 --> 04:33.197
Right here. We're gonna go
about 17 stories high, if we can.

04:33.365 --> 04:37.994
We're gonna continue using Sony products.
Domo arigato to the Sony products, really.

04:38.203 --> 04:40.997
In fact, if you need someone
to eat some sashimi with you...

04:41.206 --> 04:42.749
...you give me a ring because...

04:42.916 --> 04:44.834
- Levison's right here.
- Write it down.

04:45.002 --> 04:47.754
I have to know that you're just seeing it.

04:48.380 --> 04:49.422
Good girl.

04:49.590 --> 04:51.340
Traffic from Malibu was impossible.

04:51.508 --> 04:53.301
- Morning, Joel.
- Morning, Celia.

04:53.469 --> 04:55.261
- Sandy, park the car, please.
- Okay.

04:55.429 --> 04:57.221
- Morning, Marty.
- Morning, Joel.

04:57.389 --> 04:58.765
Hi.

04:59.308 --> 05:03.728
- What are the Japs doing here?
- So, what's this talk about heads will roll?

05:03.896 --> 05:05.646
The bank's putting the screws to us.

05:05.814 --> 05:08.357
Harvey Goldman's son's coming out,
and I don't like it.

05:08.567 --> 05:12.236
Reggie Goldman's a pipsqueak.
You can't be serious.

05:12.446 --> 05:15.364
You know, some changes
are going on around here.

05:15.532 --> 05:19.368
It's always the way.
Happened at Paramount three years ago.

05:19.536 --> 05:21.412
Columbia's going through it now.

05:21.622 --> 05:23.706
I hear we're looking to replace Griffin.

05:23.916 --> 05:26.417
Griffin? I don't believe it. With who?

05:26.627 --> 05:28.544
Berg, Kirkpatrick. Maybe Larry Levy.

05:28.712 --> 05:33.424
Yeah. Yeah, well, I wanna know why
the security is so lax, that's why.

05:33.634 --> 05:36.511
I'll talk to you about it later.
I'm in the middle of a pitch.

05:36.678 --> 05:38.721
- Listen. Go ahead.
- Yeah, okay, okay.

05:38.889 --> 05:41.724
It's a TV star and she goes on safari
in Africa.

05:41.892 --> 05:44.227
You're talking about a TV star
in a motion picture?

05:44.394 --> 05:46.938
Not a real TV star.
It would be played by a movie star.

05:47.105 --> 05:50.525
- A movie star playing a television star.
- Goldie, Julia, Michelle...

05:50.734 --> 05:52.235
...Bette, Lily.
- Dolly Parton.

05:52.402 --> 05:54.278
- Dolly.
- She would be very good.

05:54.488 --> 05:56.572
- I like Goldie.
- Goldie Goes to Africa.

05:56.740 --> 05:57.949
Great. We have a relationship.

05:58.116 --> 06:01.285
- That would be great. Goldie Goes to Africa.
- Goldie Goes to Africa.

06:01.453 --> 06:03.412
- She becomes worshiped.
- Worshiped?

06:03.580 --> 06:05.581
- Well, she's found by this tribe...
- Yes?

06:05.749 --> 06:07.542
Of small people. But then she has to...

06:07.709 --> 06:10.378
She's found by this tribe
and they worship her. But then...

06:10.546 --> 06:12.672
I see. It's like a Gods Must Be Crazy...

06:12.840 --> 06:14.924
...except the Coke bottle's
now a television actress.

06:15.092 --> 06:17.552
Yeah, exactly right.
It's Out of Africa meets Pretty Woman.

06:17.719 --> 06:19.136
And she has to decide...

06:19.304 --> 06:23.182
...whether to stay with the TV show
or save this entire African tribe.

06:23.392 --> 06:24.433
It could be a man.

06:24.601 --> 06:26.853
Hey, where's Griffin Mill's office?
- Right here.

06:27.020 --> 06:30.064
- Hey, you're Martin Scorsese.
- No, but I know Harvey Keitel.

06:30.232 --> 06:33.776
Yeah, I know you do.
Hey, I loved Cape Fear. Ha, ha.

06:33.944 --> 06:36.279
- My old man worked for Hitchcock too.
- Yeah?

06:36.488 --> 06:40.074
Rope. It was a masterpiece.
The story wasn't any good.

06:40.242 --> 06:43.369
He shot the whole thing without cuts.
I hate all this cut, cut, cut.

06:43.537 --> 06:47.039
Oh, yeah, well, what about, uh, Bertolucci,
that great tracking shot...

06:47.291 --> 06:51.002
...with Winger in Sheltering Sky?
- I didn't see it.

06:52.421 --> 06:54.630
Touch of Evil, that was the one.
Welles...

06:54.798 --> 06:56.716
I been here since 8:00. Honest I have.

06:56.884 --> 06:59.802
I stuck my neck out for you to get this job.
Who were you with?

06:59.970 --> 07:04.056
- I was there with, um, Alan Rudolph.
- What were you doing with Alan Rudolph?

07:04.224 --> 07:07.393
Well, no, he asked me to have coffee.
He was telling me this idea.

07:07.561 --> 07:09.270
- What do I say?
- You're my assistant.

07:09.438 --> 07:13.107
- Don't get involved with writers.
- I wasn't. I was just listening to this idea.

07:13.275 --> 07:15.902
- I told him he should give it to you.
- What's your pitch?

07:16.069 --> 07:17.737
Well, does political scare you?

07:17.946 --> 07:20.990
Political doesn't scare me.
Radical political scares me.

07:21.158 --> 07:24.493
- "Political" political scares me.
- This is politely politically radical.

07:24.661 --> 07:25.870
- Is it funny?
- It's funny.

07:26.079 --> 07:28.205
- It's a funny political thing.
- It's a thriller too.

07:28.415 --> 07:30.082
- It's a thriller?
- All at once.

07:30.334 --> 07:31.584
So, uh, what's the story?

07:31.835 --> 07:34.128
Well, I want Bruce Willis.
I think I can talk to him.

07:34.296 --> 07:37.757
Um, it's a story about a senator.
A bad-guy senator at first.

07:37.966 --> 07:40.593
He's traveling around the country
on the country's dime.

07:40.761 --> 07:44.847
- Like that Sununu guy used to do.
- Sort of a cynical, political thriller-comedy?

07:45.057 --> 07:47.266
Yeah, but it's got a heart, uh,
in the right spot.

07:47.476 --> 07:49.936
And anyway, he has an accident.

07:50.145 --> 07:53.230
- An accident?
- Yeah, and he becomes clairvoyant.

07:53.440 --> 07:55.066
- Like a psychic. Yeah.
- Oh, I see.

07:55.275 --> 07:58.402
So it's kind of a psychic, political
thriller-comedy with a heart.

07:58.612 --> 08:02.907
With a heart. And, uh, not unlike Ghost
meets Manchurian Candidate.

08:03.116 --> 08:05.993
- Go on, I'm listening.
- He can start to read people's minds...

08:06.161 --> 08:11.040
...and when he gets to the president's mind,
it's completely blank. Completely blank.

08:11.208 --> 08:13.501
- Can I get you anything?
- I'd like a beer, please.

08:13.669 --> 08:17.380
- We don't have beer.
- Uh, wine. Red wine, please.

08:18.256 --> 08:22.093
Of course, someone gets killed at the end.
They always do in political thrillers.

08:23.887 --> 08:24.887
Griffin Mill's office.

08:25.055 --> 08:26.722
I know. Can you put him on?

08:26.890 --> 08:29.433
- It's an intriguing idea, Jim.
- May I ask who's calling?

08:29.601 --> 08:31.560
I'd like to speak to Griffin Mill.

08:31.728 --> 08:34.105
He's in a meeting.
I'll have him get back to you.

08:34.272 --> 08:35.940
- I'll get back to you.
- Thanks.

08:36.107 --> 08:37.900
- Excuse me, sir?
- Bullshit.

08:38.068 --> 08:39.568
- He'll get back to me?
- Seen my Binaca?

08:39.736 --> 08:41.404
Do you know how many times
I've heard that?

08:41.571 --> 08:44.115
- Who is this?
- If he don't get back to me...

08:44.282 --> 08:45.908
- I read that script.
- Who was that?

08:46.076 --> 08:47.368
I don't know. He didn't say.

08:47.536 --> 08:50.496
- What do you mean, he didn't say?
- How are you gonna cast it?

08:50.706 --> 08:53.666
The lead character is a 50-year-old
female circus performer.

08:53.834 --> 08:56.627
- A fire-eater.
- Let me read the coverage.

08:56.920 --> 08:59.005
Are we still having lunch
with Aaron Camp?

08:59.172 --> 09:01.924
- Yeah, what time?
- I made it for 1:00.

09:02.259 --> 09:04.635
- Bad day?
- He's having writer's block.

09:06.930 --> 09:09.974
You have a meeting with Harders
and Frank South this afternoon.

09:10.142 --> 09:12.268
- What time? I'll be here.
- At 3:00. Okay.

09:12.436 --> 09:13.936
Put the meetings on the computer.

09:14.104 --> 09:15.938
- All right.
- Thanks.

09:16.106 --> 09:18.482
- You going now? I'll go with you.
- I'm going to see Levison.

09:18.650 --> 09:21.152
I'll meet you there.
Order me a salad and Crystal Geyser.

09:21.361 --> 09:22.611
- Okay. Bye.
- Thanks.

09:22.779 --> 09:23.946
Bonnie, can I please...?

09:24.114 --> 09:26.323
We gotta have a time to meet. I'm sorry.

09:30.454 --> 09:33.622
- Okay, by 5? Thanks, Sandy.
- Bye.

09:33.790 --> 09:35.166
- Hi, Sandy. Hi, Celia.
- Oh, uh...

09:35.375 --> 09:37.460
You can't go in there. He's in a meeting.

09:37.627 --> 09:40.171
I think, you know,
dime a dozen out here, don't you?

09:40.380 --> 09:42.715
- It's all right, Celia.
- You know this one?

09:42.883 --> 09:44.967
Griffin, I don't think
you've met Reg Goldman.

09:45.177 --> 09:48.512
- You know his father, Harvey.
- Yes, of course. Hi. Hi, Reg.

09:48.680 --> 09:50.681
- Nice to meet you.
- From the bank in Boston.

09:50.849 --> 09:53.976
- Reg is out here for a couple of weeks.
- Great.

09:54.186 --> 09:57.813
- Business or pleasure?
- A little of both, I hope.

09:58.231 --> 10:00.858
Reg is thinking of getting
into production, Griffin.

10:01.068 --> 10:02.401
Oh, really?

10:02.611 --> 10:04.862
Yeah. It beats work, doesn't it, Griffin?

10:05.072 --> 10:07.323
Like to play some tennis though.
You play tennis?

10:07.532 --> 10:09.742
Tennis? No, no, no. I, uh, ha, ha...

10:09.910 --> 10:12.495
- I'm too busy for...
- I was just asking Walter here.

10:12.996 --> 10:14.872
Uh, do you know Meg Ryan?

10:15.082 --> 10:16.874
Do you know if she's seeing somebody?

10:18.335 --> 10:21.670
Um, yeah, Reg, she's married.

10:21.838 --> 10:23.214
Shit.

10:23.673 --> 10:26.008
What about Winona Ryder?

10:26.843 --> 10:30.888
Um, well, uh, you know,
actually Walter is the guy to talk to.

10:31.098 --> 10:32.807
Walter's got everybody's number.

10:32.974 --> 10:36.852
- Was there anything?
- Uh, no. You're real busy.

10:37.521 --> 10:40.773
I want that number, goddamn it.
I want that number.

10:41.024 --> 10:44.568
Oh, boy. What about this one here?
Has she done anything?

10:45.737 --> 10:47.404
Celia.

10:48.532 --> 10:51.325
Griffin, don't ask.

10:51.535 --> 10:55.871
Don't ask, "You don't know"
or don't ask, "I don't wanna know"?

10:56.081 --> 10:58.582
Just don't ask.

10:59.543 --> 11:04.171
Look, if it's... If it's Reggie Goldman
you're concerned about, forget it.

11:04.381 --> 11:06.715
But be nice to him.
He represents a lot of money.

11:06.883 --> 11:09.885
It's not Reggie Goldman
I'm worried about.

11:10.095 --> 11:13.389
- It's Larry Levy.
- Larry Levy?

11:13.598 --> 11:15.057
Larry Levy's at Fox, isn't he?

11:17.978 --> 11:19.937
Oh, come on, Celia.

11:20.147 --> 11:23.232
Sandy, there's a call for Celia on Line 1.

11:23.441 --> 11:26.735
- Should I be looking for a job?
- Celia, are you there?

11:26.987 --> 11:28.737
Joel Levison's office.

11:28.905 --> 11:32.783
Oh, Brad. Yeah. What?

11:32.993 --> 11:35.578
No, we couldn't sign Anjelica Huston
for that project.

11:35.745 --> 11:37.454
She's booked for the next two years.

11:37.747 --> 11:41.750
Yeah, like a ghost story,
but that's not like Ghost.

11:41.960 --> 11:43.419
- Well, now...
- Um, in which, maybe...

11:43.587 --> 11:44.879
We should be somewhere...

11:45.046 --> 11:49.091
...but I understand what you're saying.
- Unnatural Lives. It's a supernatural thing.

11:50.260 --> 11:51.844
Joel. Griffin Mill.

11:52.095 --> 11:54.180
- Friend of Jennifer's.
- No, no.

11:54.389 --> 11:55.848
- You're Griffin Mill?
- Yes.

11:56.099 --> 11:57.308
- Really?
- Good to see you.

11:57.517 --> 11:59.018
- I'm a big fan.
- I have that tie.

11:59.227 --> 12:01.395
- You do?
- Mr. Mill, how are you today?

12:01.563 --> 12:04.899
- Okay. How are you doing, Natalie?
- Fine. Have a seat.

12:05.066 --> 12:07.109
Where's Bonnie?

12:07.319 --> 12:10.487
- Did you order for me?
- Oh, my gosh. I'm shocked.

12:10.655 --> 12:11.822
- Hi, Griffin.
- Hi.

12:11.990 --> 12:13.199
- Hi, buddy.
- Hi. How are you?

12:13.366 --> 12:14.450
Lunching with the enemy.

12:15.827 --> 12:17.620
Oh, come on.

12:17.787 --> 12:20.706
So, uh,
what's this we hear about Larry Levy?

12:20.957 --> 12:24.752
Larry Levy?
If he had half a brain, he'd be dangerous.

12:26.546 --> 12:28.964
Aaron says he's coming to the studio.

12:29.132 --> 12:32.468
Aaron says, eh? Why would
you believe anything he says?

12:32.636 --> 12:34.637
I don't know. The way he said it.

12:34.804 --> 12:37.640
The authority he said it with.
He's over there with...

12:37.807 --> 12:40.351
- Who?
- Anjelica Huston and John Cusack.

12:40.518 --> 12:41.810
- Levy?
- Yep.

12:41.978 --> 12:45.189
He's in over his head.
They're gonna drown over there.

12:45.398 --> 12:47.858
Quite the golden boy at Fox these days.

12:48.068 --> 12:50.110
Did you see that thing on him
in Variety?

12:50.278 --> 12:51.820
- The big spread?
- Oh, two pages.

12:51.988 --> 12:53.948
- Sure.
- Anjelica. Griffin Mill.

12:54.115 --> 12:55.324
- Oh, hi.
- Good to see you.

12:55.492 --> 12:56.700
- You too.
- Looking great.

12:56.910 --> 12:59.453
Hey, Johnny.
Griffin Mill, I'm a big fan of yours.

12:59.621 --> 13:02.665
- Gonna be in Telluride this year?
- I'm probably gonna be in Park City.

13:02.832 --> 13:06.043
- Oh, great. We'll see you there.
- Okay.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.837
What's happening with Glass Box?

13:09.005 --> 13:11.590
Can we talk about something
other than Hollywood for a change?

13:11.800 --> 13:13.259
- Yes.
- We're educated people.

13:13.426 --> 13:16.053
- Sure.
- Sure, Griffin.

13:20.100 --> 13:22.226
- I'll call you later.
- Okay.

13:54.467 --> 13:56.302
Shouldn't you talk to somebody about this?

13:56.469 --> 13:57.886
- What?
- These postcards.

13:58.054 --> 13:59.847
- You've gotten five in two weeks.
- Seven.

14:00.015 --> 14:02.516
Why don't you just talk
to studio security?

14:02.684 --> 14:04.935
I'm supposed to call
Walter Stuckel and say what?

14:05.103 --> 14:07.563
"Walter, listen, someone's sending me
poison pen letters...

14:07.731 --> 14:11.400
...and I would like for you to make me
the object of more ridicule and abuse...

14:11.568 --> 14:14.737
...now that things are really shaky
for me." No, I don't think so.

14:14.904 --> 14:16.613
I think they're coming from a writer.

14:16.823 --> 14:18.866
- Which one?
- Take your pick.

14:21.328 --> 14:23.746
- Is there anything else?
- Yes, your attorney phoned.

14:23.913 --> 14:27.750
- Wants you to come to a party at his house.
- Get me out of it. I'm in a screening.

14:27.959 --> 14:29.793
Not that attorney. It's Dick Mellen.

14:30.003 --> 14:32.379
- Oh, Dick. What time?
- Cocktails at 7:30.

14:32.547 --> 14:33.881
Dinner at 8. Bring a date.

14:34.049 --> 14:37.509
- And Bonnie Sherow is here to see you.
- One more sensitive male-bonding script.

14:37.677 --> 14:39.553
Send her in. Oh, there she is.

14:39.763 --> 14:42.556
Griffin, can we go
to the springs this weekend?

14:42.766 --> 14:44.266
I wanna have a massage...

14:44.476 --> 14:47.353
...I wanna have a long soak
in a hot mineral tub...

14:47.562 --> 14:50.481
...and I wanna have margaritas
administered intravenously.

14:50.690 --> 14:52.816
I have a party at Dick Mellen's.
Wanna come?

14:52.984 --> 14:56.779
- Oh, God, movie stars and power players.
- And vodka.

14:56.946 --> 14:58.364
Sure.

14:58.656 --> 15:01.617
It'll be an early dinner
and we'll go to my place afterwards.

15:01.826 --> 15:03.660
- Can we?
- Yeah.

15:16.383 --> 15:20.177
Brokaw looks like
he has absolutely no retention.

15:20.387 --> 15:23.597
Ted Koppel looks loose,
and he goes after it, and he digs in...

15:23.807 --> 15:26.141
...and he doesn't get thrown very easy.

15:27.477 --> 15:29.353
- You remember?
- Sure.

15:29.562 --> 15:32.064
Hi. How are you? Ha, ha.

15:32.315 --> 15:34.316
- Marlee, this is Bonnie Sherow.
- Hi.

15:34.526 --> 15:36.944
- She read, um, Tales of Fury.
- How are you?

15:37.112 --> 15:40.656
- I loved it. I loved it. I read your script.
- That's great.

15:40.865 --> 15:43.534
It was wonderful.
And I think you're perfect for Ariel.

15:43.743 --> 15:45.369
- Thank you.
- Perfect for the part.

15:45.578 --> 15:49.415
Yeah. We're gonna make just
a couple of changes in the third act.

15:49.624 --> 15:51.583
- Just...
- You should set up a meeting.

15:51.835 --> 15:52.835
Yeah.

15:53.044 --> 15:54.336
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, sure.

15:54.546 --> 15:56.088
- Yes.
- You have my number?

15:56.256 --> 15:58.674
- Yes, absolutely.
- Yes, I'll speak to you next week.

15:58.842 --> 15:59.842
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

16:00.009 --> 16:01.593
Go say hello to some people here.

16:01.761 --> 16:03.887
You don't talk about script changes
at parties.

16:04.055 --> 16:05.180
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.

16:05.348 --> 16:06.640
It was good of you to come.

16:06.808 --> 16:09.017
- Don't you look beautiful?
- Thank you.

16:09.227 --> 16:11.019
- You know Bonnie Sherow.
- Of course.

16:11.229 --> 16:13.355
How are you?
Good to see you. TriStar, right?

16:13.523 --> 16:15.357
- Watch your step.
- She's at the studio.

16:15.525 --> 16:19.528
Yeah, that's what I meant.
How about...? Uh, bring Mr. Mill a martini.

16:19.696 --> 16:22.197
- Bunny, how about you?
- Actually, I'll take a RamlÃ¶sa.

16:22.365 --> 16:23.699
- I'll have a martini.
- Okay.

16:23.867 --> 16:27.161
Okay. One of each. Rod Steiger's here.

16:27.328 --> 16:30.747
Why don't you, uh...? Why don't you
talk to him about the Rudolph project?

16:30.957 --> 16:35.127
He's not that hot on it, but, uh, see if you
can get him to at least, you know, read it.

16:35.295 --> 16:37.421
- Okay.
- You know who's here is Harry Belafonte.

16:37.589 --> 16:39.173
- Harry?
- I love Harry Belafonte.

16:39.340 --> 16:42.718
- I love him.
- Come and say hello. Harry, say hello.

16:42.886 --> 16:44.595
- Griffin Mill and Bunny.
- How are you?

16:44.762 --> 16:46.096
- Good to see you.
- Hi.

16:46.264 --> 16:48.390
- Bonnie Sherow.
- She's just gaga over you.

16:48.558 --> 16:49.683
I'm a big fan of yours.

16:49.893 --> 16:52.519
I saw you accept
the Nelson Mandela Courage Award.

16:53.563 --> 16:55.189
Who's the guy in Ghostbusters?

16:55.398 --> 16:57.566
Uh, you know, the villain in Ghostbusters.

16:57.734 --> 17:00.444
Uh... I... You got me. That wasn't...

17:00.904 --> 17:03.071
I got this, uh...

17:04.156 --> 17:06.992
This p... I got this postcard.

17:07.202 --> 17:09.243
You know, harassment kind of...
But you know.

17:09.412 --> 17:12.498
I don't. Tell me,
what are you talking about?

17:12.790 --> 17:15.959
Well, it's some writer
I must have brushed off.

17:16.169 --> 17:17.627
Folks, get something to eat.

17:17.795 --> 17:19.296
- Good idea.
- There's lovely stuff.

17:19.464 --> 17:21.757
- We will. In a few minutes.
- We're wasting away.

17:21.925 --> 17:23.925
- Your hands are as cold as mine.
- Freezing.

17:24.093 --> 17:25.719
I think... Would you like one of these?

17:25.887 --> 17:28.597
- Um, I don't think I do.
- That one right there.

17:28.806 --> 17:30.933
Not threats?
You talking about threats?

17:31.100 --> 17:32.935
Well, no.

17:33.269 --> 17:35.479
Y... Yes. I don't know.

17:35.688 --> 17:37.272
He's pissed off.

17:37.482 --> 17:39.274
I thought writers were your long suit.

17:39.442 --> 17:41.944
You're the writer's executive,
aren't you?

17:42.111 --> 17:43.820
Are you pitching me a dream? Ha, ha.

17:43.988 --> 17:45.989
The way you say that,
that makes me think...

17:46.157 --> 17:49.743
...you're not really interested.
- It depends how good the dream is, Jeff.

17:50.286 --> 17:51.995
Levy's here.

17:55.375 --> 17:58.502
- People over there, okay?
- Dick, Dick. What's he doing here?

17:58.711 --> 18:01.296
- Goldblum? He's a friend.
- No, Larry Levy.

18:01.464 --> 18:04.716
He came with Sally. He's a buddy...
- What's going on with my job?

18:04.968 --> 18:07.261
I mean, you know,
Larry Levy, everywhere I look.

18:07.470 --> 18:09.638
- He's in my face.
- Larry Levy's a comer.

18:09.847 --> 18:12.474
That's what comers do,
they get in your face.

18:12.642 --> 18:15.602
You're a comer too. You can handle him.
Stop worrying about it.

18:15.770 --> 18:17.688
So the rumors are true?

18:17.897 --> 18:21.650
- Rumors are always true, you know that.
- I'm always the last to hear about them.

18:21.818 --> 18:24.987
You're the last one to believe.
I told you that before.

18:25.154 --> 18:26.363
So am I out?

18:26.948 --> 18:29.283
Not out,
but start thinking about a roommate.

18:29.450 --> 18:32.828
Relax, you can handle this.
You know, you can make him work for it.

18:32.996 --> 18:34.705
- Excuse me...
- Larry?

18:34.914 --> 18:36.999
Dick. Sorry to crash your party.

18:37.166 --> 18:39.835
- Do you know everybody?
- I will before the night's out.

18:40.003 --> 18:43.839
You will. You will indeed.
It's a good crowd of people.

18:45.633 --> 18:48.552
- Great party, Dick.
- Good. Did you get some food?

18:48.720 --> 18:50.345
- Actually, we're gonna...
- Not yet.

18:54.434 --> 18:55.892
Listen to this. Listen to this.

18:56.102 --> 18:58.770
"He lifts her dress.
She kisses him harder.

18:59.022 --> 19:02.608
He puts his hands in her underpants.
She grabs his shoulders.

19:02.817 --> 19:04.651
He pulls her dress above her waist.

19:04.861 --> 19:07.362
He rubs against her wide, soft belly.

19:07.572 --> 19:12.075
Slowly, he pushes her panties down to
her knees. She is faint with passion.

19:12.285 --> 19:15.370
She arches her back and he lowers
her down onto the buckboard.

19:15.580 --> 19:17.372
The horses snort and whinny.

19:17.582 --> 19:19.958
They too seem to be feeling
her passion.

19:20.168 --> 19:22.794
The camera moves in
on the nostrils of the horse...

19:22.962 --> 19:27.049
...as the buckboard begins to shake."
Oh, my God.

19:27.216 --> 19:30.177
Can you believe that?
Steve recommended that script.

19:30.345 --> 19:32.471
He says they're hot for it
over at Universal.

19:32.639 --> 19:36.016
- They're gonna have a bidding war.
- I heard a pitch today. It wasn't bad.

19:36.184 --> 19:39.227
- I'm stuck on a story point though.
- I'm the story editor. Go.

19:39.395 --> 19:42.064
New York City, Madison Avenue.
Big advertising agency.

19:42.231 --> 19:45.567
Account executive makes a presentation
to someone he wants as a client.

19:45.735 --> 19:47.903
The client promises to get back to him.

19:48.071 --> 19:50.739
- Does it have to be advertising?
- That's not the problem.

19:50.907 --> 19:54.534
The account executive keeps waiting
for the client to call him back...

19:54.702 --> 19:58.413
...to tell him what he thought of the idea,
tell him if he got the job or not...

19:58.581 --> 20:00.457
...but the client never calls.

20:00.667 --> 20:03.794
So the account executive
gets so pissed off, so frustrated...

20:03.961 --> 20:07.923
...that he becomes obsessive,
and he decides to drive the client crazy.

20:08.132 --> 20:11.551
- What does he do?
- Sends him threatening postcards.

20:11.719 --> 20:13.595
It's not important.

20:13.930 --> 20:15.013
Here's the problem.

20:15.223 --> 20:21.144
How long do you think
the account executive harasses the client...

20:21.354 --> 20:23.605
...before he becomes dangerous?

20:23.815 --> 20:26.692
- Does it have to be advertising?
- How long?

20:26.901 --> 20:29.319
All right, if it were me...

20:29.612 --> 20:32.114
- One month?
- Three months.

20:32.281 --> 20:33.782
No, no, no, more. Five months.

20:33.950 --> 20:36.993
- To be dangerous, five months.
- Five months. That's what I thought.

20:37.161 --> 20:38.912
- Who's the writer?
- I don't know.

20:39.122 --> 20:42.040
You don't know the writer
who pitched you the idea?

20:42.208 --> 20:46.169
I don't know his name. I don't know.
It's a couple of kids. Uh...

20:46.879 --> 20:49.631
- TV writers.
- Hmm.

20:49.799 --> 20:51.383
Can we go to bed now?

20:51.634 --> 20:54.302
I'm starting to wrinkle.

21:01.310 --> 21:03.228
- See you tomorrow afternoon.
- Absolutely.

21:03.396 --> 21:05.480
Burt. Larry Levy.
I hope you don't remember me.

21:05.648 --> 21:07.649
If you do,
I hope there are no hard feelings.

21:07.817 --> 21:10.652
- I was only working for Kastner at the time.
- Yeah, right.

21:15.867 --> 21:17.743
- Bye.
- Take care.

21:17.910 --> 21:20.579
- Who's that?
- Uh, an exec over at Fox.

21:20.747 --> 21:22.789
- Or was until this breakfast anyways.
- Yeah.

21:31.507 --> 21:36.094
- Morning, Mr. Mill. Welcome to Geoffrey's.
- Hi, Susan. How are you? I'm with Joel.

21:36.846 --> 21:38.096
Hi, Burt. Griffin Mill.

21:38.264 --> 21:39.806
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

21:40.016 --> 21:42.184
Griffin. Nice to see you this morning.
Bye-bye.

21:42.351 --> 21:46.062
- Asshole.
- Ha, ha. One of a breed, yes.

21:46.773 --> 21:49.816
Actually, he's not one of a breed.
There's a whole breed of them.

21:49.984 --> 21:52.694
- They're breeding them actually.
- You're losing your touch.

21:52.862 --> 21:56.865
Scheduling these meetings so close together.
Guy didn't have time to finish breakfast.

21:57.033 --> 22:00.118
- He'd already eaten. Gets up early.
- Yeah.

22:00.286 --> 22:03.622
- You went to Mellen's last night.
- Would you take this away? Yes, I did.

22:03.790 --> 22:06.416
- How is he?
- I would like a Vittel water.

22:07.543 --> 22:09.461
He's fine.

22:09.712 --> 22:11.713
You left early, why?

22:12.006 --> 22:15.550
We had to work on the, uh...
On the museum party.

22:16.052 --> 22:18.595
I will not work for Larry Levy.

22:18.805 --> 22:20.889
I'm not asking you to.

22:22.391 --> 22:26.228
I report to you.
If I have to report to Larry Levy, I quit.

22:28.189 --> 22:29.606
You can't quit.

22:29.816 --> 22:33.193
I won't let you quit.
You have a year and a half on your contract.

22:33.361 --> 22:38.490
And I will sue you for breach if you don't
show up in the office every day with a smile.

22:39.200 --> 22:41.034
Why Levy?

22:41.494 --> 22:46.331
Levy was available. He's good on
material, you're good with writers.

22:46.499 --> 22:50.001
We're a team. He's a new member
of the team, that's all.

22:50.169 --> 22:53.547
- He can make us all look good.
- This is a red-wine glass.

22:53.714 --> 22:56.508
Can I have my water
in a water glass, please?

22:56.884 --> 22:58.260
Well?

22:58.970 --> 23:01.388
I'll have to think about it, Joel.

23:01.597 --> 23:03.306
I want an answer this afternoon.

23:03.641 --> 23:05.976
Well, I have to go out to Palmdale.

23:06.185 --> 23:09.646
The director of The Lonely Room
is giving Lily a hard time.

23:10.356 --> 23:11.648
I'll be back around 5.

23:11.858 --> 23:14.985
- So call after 5.
- I'll get back to you.

23:15.152 --> 23:18.572
But I said, "You know, you
haven't gone... You haven't died enough."

23:18.739 --> 23:20.657
So he's still hanging on.

23:33.170 --> 23:34.588
- Griffin.
- Yeah.

23:34.755 --> 23:37.549
- Joel Levison on Line 2. Put him through?
- No. I'll get back to him.

23:37.717 --> 23:39.467
Tell Joel Levison
you'll get back to him?

23:39.635 --> 23:41.094
- Yeah.
- Yes, sir.

23:41.262 --> 23:43.513
I wanna hear what he's gotta say.

23:52.857 --> 23:55.817
- How did this get here?
- The mail.

23:56.027 --> 23:58.820
But this does not have a postmark.
This was hand-delivered.

23:59.155 --> 24:02.574
Not to me. It came with the mail.
Jimmy?

24:02.992 --> 24:04.492
Huh?

24:04.952 --> 24:08.038
You know anything about this?
Who delivered it, where it came from?

24:09.332 --> 24:10.373
Mailroom?

24:10.583 --> 24:13.001
But I wanna know how it got
to the goddamn mailroom.

24:13.169 --> 24:14.961
Find out for me and get back to me.

24:15.129 --> 24:16.838
- Okay, sure.
- You go with him.

24:17.924 --> 24:21.176
- You want me to go to the mailroom?
- Yes. I want you to go to the mailroom.

24:21.344 --> 24:25.555
And while you're there, I would like a, uh,
copy of The Lonely Room rewrites.

24:25.765 --> 24:28.099
In white pages, no color.

24:28.351 --> 24:30.894
- And find out how this got in my mail.
- Yes, sir.

24:31.270 --> 24:35.357
- You'll get your own phones, I take it?
- Yes, I can get my own phone, Jan.

24:41.822 --> 24:43.740
Son of a bitch. Five months.

24:43.908 --> 24:48.662
One, two, three, four, five. April.

24:50.247 --> 24:52.123
"Pitches. Richard Fielder, David Lucas...

24:54.001 --> 24:55.377
...Adam Silverstein...

24:56.587 --> 24:58.380
...Bill Lindstrom, David Kahane...

24:58.547 --> 25:00.674
...Sandra Potenza."

25:06.055 --> 25:08.014
Incoming.

25:11.394 --> 25:14.771
Incoming. Unreturned calls.

25:14.981 --> 25:17.732
Bill Lindstrom again.

25:17.900 --> 25:22.195
Nancy Franklin. Wouldn't be a woman.
Wouldn't be a woman. David Kahane.

25:23.906 --> 25:28.493
Oh, come on. Sort, sort, sort. Come on.

25:30.955 --> 25:34.791
Come on. Kahane, Kahane, Kahane.
Lindstrom. Lindstrom. White pages.

25:35.835 --> 25:40.005
Lindstrom. Disney, strategic planning.

25:40.172 --> 25:44.259
It wouldn't be him.
And what was that other guy's name?

25:44.760 --> 25:48.221
Kahane. Kahane. J-K.

25:48.431 --> 25:50.265
"Kalchime.

25:50.474 --> 25:51.933
Kahane."

25:52.143 --> 25:54.227
Unproduced. Got you!

26:51.994 --> 26:55.121
- Hello?
- Yes. Is David Kahane there, please?

26:55.331 --> 26:56.372
David?

27:01.045 --> 27:02.670
Dave?

27:03.839 --> 27:06.716
Hello? I'm really sorry, I forgot.
He's gone out.

27:06.926 --> 27:08.176
- Oh, I see.
- Who's this?

27:08.385 --> 27:10.220
This is Griffin Mill.

27:10.513 --> 27:13.890
- Oh, the dead man.
- What did you just say?

27:14.100 --> 27:16.559
- About... About me being a dead man.
- Oh, nothing.

27:16.811 --> 27:20.605
Just a nickname David has for you.

27:20.815 --> 27:24.484
Oh, I see. That's a funny nickname.

27:24.777 --> 27:28.154
So I suppose your husband
doesn't like me very much.

27:28.697 --> 27:30.740
I don't have a husband.

27:30.908 --> 27:32.992
I suppose David doesn't like me
very much.

27:33.160 --> 27:35.411
David's, uh, gone to the cinema.

27:35.621 --> 27:37.247
When will he be back?

27:37.456 --> 27:39.457
When the film's over, I presume.

27:39.667 --> 27:41.960
And you are?

27:42.586 --> 27:45.171
- June.
- June...

27:45.381 --> 27:47.590
Here we go.
You want to know my last name.

27:47.800 --> 27:49.884
You won't be able to pronounce it.
No one can.

27:50.052 --> 27:53.138
- Try me.
- Gudmundsdottir.

27:53.347 --> 27:54.681
Goodmanzdaughter.

27:54.890 --> 27:58.059
- Gudmundsdottir.
- Gudmundsdottir.

27:58.269 --> 28:00.895
- How's that?
- Hey, you're very good.

28:01.063 --> 28:02.647
Thanks.

28:03.816 --> 28:06.151
What do people usually say?

28:06.777 --> 28:12.699
Don't ask. Like anything
from Goodogzwater to Goulashwallop.

28:14.535 --> 28:15.869
You English?

28:16.078 --> 28:19.080
Yeah. Well, no, no, not really.

28:19.290 --> 28:22.125
Well, where are you
kind of sort of not from?

28:22.334 --> 28:26.087
Well, do you want the long story
or the short one?

28:26.380 --> 28:28.464
- The long one.
- No, you'd never believe it.

28:28.674 --> 28:30.633
The short one's Iceland.

28:30.843 --> 28:32.427
Iceland.

28:32.636 --> 28:36.222
I didn't know anyone came from Iceland.
I thought it was just a block of ice.

28:36.390 --> 28:38.641
It's very green, actually.

28:38.809 --> 28:41.102
Really? I thought that was Greenland.

28:41.312 --> 28:45.607
No. Greenland's very icy.
Iceland's very green.

28:46.025 --> 28:49.777
They switched names to fool the Vikings,
who were trying to steal their women.

28:49.987 --> 28:51.029
Oh, I see.

28:51.238 --> 28:54.032
No. Blue sea.

28:54.241 --> 28:56.034
- Red sea.
- No, no, no.

28:56.368 --> 28:59.287
- No red.
- You're a painter.

28:59.455 --> 29:01.497
How did you guess?

29:03.167 --> 29:05.501
So, what movie did David go to see?

29:05.669 --> 29:09.255
Um, he went to the Rialto in Pasadena.
He always goes there.

29:09.465 --> 29:11.216
What's showing?

29:12.301 --> 29:14.636
Bicycle Thief, I think.

29:15.638 --> 29:17.931
It's a good movie. Have you seen it?

29:19.225 --> 29:21.476
No, I don't go to the movies.

29:21.644 --> 29:23.853
You don't? Why not?

29:25.814 --> 29:27.523
Oh...

29:30.945 --> 29:33.154
Life is too short.

29:33.447 --> 29:35.698
I've gotta hang up now.

31:00.993 --> 31:02.827
David Kahane.

31:02.995 --> 31:05.246
No, you have the wrong guy, man.

31:22.306 --> 31:24.932
- You didn't like it?
- It's a foreign film.

31:26.602 --> 31:30.146
David Kahane. Griffin Mill.

31:30.981 --> 31:34.525
Griffin Mill. Yeah?

31:34.735 --> 31:36.903
Great movie, huh?

31:37.071 --> 31:41.032
It's so refreshing to see something
like this after all these cop movies...

31:41.241 --> 31:45.078
...and, you know, things we do.

31:45.579 --> 31:47.038
Maybe we'll do a remake of this.

31:47.247 --> 31:50.541
- You'd probably give it a happy ending.
- Oh, no, no. We'd keep it pure.

31:50.751 --> 31:52.627
Sure, right.

31:52.795 --> 31:54.462
Do you wanna write it?

31:55.339 --> 31:57.507
- Don't fuck with me.
- I'm not fucking with you.

31:57.716 --> 32:01.386
- I said that I'd get back to you, didn't I?
- Yeah. About six months ago.

32:01.553 --> 32:03.721
- I thought you'd forgotten.
- You were angry.

32:05.766 --> 32:08.351
- Maybe.
- Do you wanna talk about it?

32:09.395 --> 32:11.896
- Okay, sure.
- Great.

32:12.648 --> 32:15.233
Let's let the studio buy us a drink.

32:17.611 --> 32:21.489
Well, if you don't mind a place where you
don't have any suck with the maÃ®tre d'...

32:21.698 --> 32:24.784
...I know a bar down the street.
- Let's go.

32:31.750 --> 32:34.168
Have you ever been to Japan?

32:34.378 --> 32:38.631
Yes, I was there once
on a location scout with Steven Spielberg.

32:38.799 --> 32:40.967
I lived there for a year.

32:41.427 --> 32:43.261
- Student year abroad.
- Great.

32:43.470 --> 32:46.222
You know, I wish I'd done that.

32:46.432 --> 32:49.684
Well, I think about it a lot.
I'll never forget it.

32:49.852 --> 32:51.811
You should write about it.

32:52.354 --> 32:55.356
I did. Don't you remember?

32:56.191 --> 32:57.650
What?

32:59.903 --> 33:04.699
My idea about the American
student who goes to Japan.

33:05.117 --> 33:08.202
That was my pitch, the one you
were supposed to get back to me on.

33:08.412 --> 33:09.495
You don't remember, do you?

33:10.873 --> 33:12.748
Of course I remember.

33:13.917 --> 33:15.126
You never got back to me.

33:16.295 --> 33:17.920
Listen.

33:18.464 --> 33:21.966
I was an asshole, all right?

33:22.176 --> 33:23.634
It comes with the job.

33:24.011 --> 33:26.429
I'm sorry, I really am.

33:28.056 --> 33:30.308
I know how angry you must've been.

33:30.517 --> 33:32.977
I'll make it up to you.
That's what I'm here for.

33:33.687 --> 33:36.063
I wanna give you a deal, David.

33:36.648 --> 33:40.943
I'm not gonna guarantee I'm gonna make
the movie, but I am gonna give you a shot.

33:43.614 --> 33:48.576
Let's just, um, stop all the postcard shit,
all right?

33:49.286 --> 33:51.871
I'm here to say that I would like...

33:52.039 --> 33:54.081
...to start over.

33:55.626 --> 33:56.667
Friends.

33:56.835 --> 33:58.711
Let's begin again

33:58.879 --> 34:03.633
- Fuck you, Mill. You're a liar.
- You're stepping over the line, David.

34:03.800 --> 34:05.927
You didn't come here
to see The Bicycle Thief.

34:06.637 --> 34:09.096
You came in five minutes
before the picture ended.

34:09.306 --> 34:11.641
You nearly tripped over my feet.

34:13.393 --> 34:16.812
What'd you do, call my house? Huh?

34:17.188 --> 34:18.773
Did you speak to the ice queen?

34:20.567 --> 34:23.777
You'd like her, Mill. She's a lot like you.

34:24.404 --> 34:26.280
All heart.

34:27.491 --> 34:31.284
Before love had really taken hold

34:31.453 --> 34:33.746
You're on my list, pal.

34:34.081 --> 34:35.540
Nothing's gonna change that.

34:39.585 --> 34:41.128
See you in the next reel, asshole.

34:41.295 --> 34:43.089
Let's start over from the start

34:43.799 --> 34:46.300
Let's forget the time

34:46.467 --> 34:49.094
That you nearly broke my heart

34:49.304 --> 34:53.891
Go everywhere we've been again

34:54.268 --> 34:58.604
Let's begin again

35:16.081 --> 35:18.207
Let's begin again

35:19.459 --> 35:22.253
Let's start over from the start

35:30.971 --> 35:34.223
That's a nice boat
you got there, movie exec.

35:34.891 --> 35:38.019
It's me, the writer.
You still wanna buy my story?

35:38.186 --> 35:40.855
I told you I'd give you a deal.
Stop by the studio in the morning.

35:41.064 --> 35:44.483
- We'll work something out.
- And who will I ask for?

35:44.901 --> 35:46.819
Larry Levy?

35:48.572 --> 35:50.406
What's Larry Levy got to do with this?

35:51.199 --> 35:53.659
- How you know about Levy?
- Don't you read the trades?

35:53.827 --> 35:56.871
New York Times business section?
He's moving in, you're moving out.

35:57.039 --> 35:59.040
You can't make a deal,
that's what they say.

35:59.207 --> 36:02.710
- Yesterday's news.
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

36:03.170 --> 36:05.796
Can I borrow your mobile phone? Huh?

36:05.964 --> 36:09.216
Hi. Larry Levy.
Yeah, Larry, David Kahane here.

36:09.426 --> 36:11.969
Listen, Larry,
guess who's making promises...

36:12.179 --> 36:16.057
...about getting pictures made
to writers in parking lots.

36:16.558 --> 36:19.143
Guess what dumb,
son-of-a-bitch executive...

36:19.353 --> 36:23.105
...is trying to take advantage of me.

36:23.315 --> 36:26.984
I mean, do you realize
how unstoppable this guy is?

36:27.194 --> 36:31.030
You know, I cannot wait
to tell the world...

36:31.239 --> 36:34.659
...that when Griffin Mill
can't cut the pressure at work...

36:35.118 --> 36:37.703
...he drives out to Pasadena...

36:37.871 --> 36:40.790
...to pick fights with writers!

36:42.209 --> 36:43.959
You tell Larry Levy to give me a call.

36:44.127 --> 36:47.213
The word is out that he's gonna
start making meaningful pictures...

36:47.381 --> 36:49.298
...at the studio for a change.

36:49.508 --> 36:52.551
Let's... Let's forget this.
Just stop all the postcard shit.

36:52.719 --> 36:54.553
- I don't write postcards!
- Let's forget this!

36:54.721 --> 36:56.597
- I write scripts!
- We're both wrong! Okay?

36:56.765 --> 36:59.433
No, you're wrong, buddy.
You're in over your head.

36:59.601 --> 37:03.437
That's why you're losing your job.
And then what are you gonna do?

37:03.605 --> 37:06.941
Huh? I can write. What can you do?

37:11.613 --> 37:13.864
I said, let's forget this.

37:18.870 --> 37:20.913
Ah, shit.

37:22.999 --> 37:26.627
Mill, you okay? Are you all right?

37:33.719 --> 37:38.889
Keep it to yourself!

37:39.433 --> 37:41.892
Keep it to yourself.

38:04.916 --> 38:06.751
Kahane?

39:26.998 --> 39:28.499
You know what's interesting?

39:28.708 --> 39:30.668
I mean, who's writing this new ending?

39:30.836 --> 39:32.920
Who wrote the new ending
of Fatal Attraction?

39:33.088 --> 39:34.505
- The audience.
- In that case...

39:34.673 --> 39:37.383
A million-plus screenwriters,
the audience wrote that ending.

39:37.551 --> 39:40.761
Who's to say what it would have
done if you left the original ending?

39:40.971 --> 39:42.388
- You can't say.
- You're right.

39:42.556 --> 39:45.140
But you can say that
it's done 300 million worldwide...

39:45.308 --> 39:47.768
...with the ending selected
from the test screening.

39:48.603 --> 39:51.689
Larry, I don't believe that
you've met my assistant, Whitney Gersh.

39:51.898 --> 39:54.400
- No, I haven't.
- It's a great pleasure to meet you.

39:56.611 --> 39:58.571
- What are you doing?
- How's your picture?

39:58.738 --> 40:00.865
- It just tested last week.
- Doing well.

40:01.032 --> 40:02.867
- How well?
- It was our first test.

40:03.076 --> 40:04.618
Excuse me, Walter.

40:04.786 --> 40:09.164
Um, Joel, Griffin still isn't in, but I really
think we have to start this meeting.

40:09.332 --> 40:11.917
Okay, Celia. Thank you.

40:14.212 --> 40:16.338
You remember a movie called D.O.A.?

40:16.548 --> 40:18.799
Sure I do.
Eddie O'Brien and Pam Britton.

40:18.967 --> 40:22.136
Disney did a remake in '87 or '88.

40:22.387 --> 40:25.139
Yeah, well, I think we got, uh,
pretty much the same situation.

40:25.307 --> 40:27.808
Keep our noses clean, Walter.

40:31.062 --> 40:33.731
It's a shame to waste the picture.
It's a great picture.

40:33.899 --> 40:35.983
- It's a great story.
- Who said we're wasting it?

40:36.151 --> 40:39.320
- Where did that come from?
- You know what's interesting?

40:39.487 --> 40:42.990
- We're all too busy to go see movies...
- Griffin, you're really late.

40:43.158 --> 40:45.284
- They're waiting inside.
- You ought to try it.

40:45.452 --> 40:48.370
- What's this?
- It's a script from Todd Smith.

40:49.414 --> 40:52.333
We need to give them
the kind of pictures they want...

40:52.500 --> 40:54.668
...not the kind these writers
wanna give them.

40:54.878 --> 40:58.130
I know you guys
spend a lot of time with writers.

40:58.298 --> 41:01.967
- Believe me, you have my deepest sympathy.
- Excuse me.

41:02.177 --> 41:05.930
- Hello. Sorry I'm late.
- You certainly are.

41:06.598 --> 41:09.016
- Jan, can I talk to you, please?
- Yeah.

41:09.267 --> 41:11.518
Just a couple minutes
in your office is fine.

41:12.395 --> 41:17.274
Griffin, you missed the formal
welcoming ceremony. You know Larry Levy.

41:17.901 --> 41:19.985
Of course. Hi, Larry.

41:21.655 --> 41:23.530
- Hi.
- Larry was able to get out of Fox...

41:23.782 --> 41:26.992
...earlier than he thought
and has come aboard as of this morning.

41:27.160 --> 41:30.329
Great. Well, let's, uh... Let's start.

41:30.830 --> 41:33.248
- Larry was in the middle of something.
- No. I wasn't.

41:33.416 --> 41:35.668
I was just killing time waiting for Griffin.

41:35.877 --> 41:38.837
Well, no. Finish. What were you saying?

41:39.047 --> 41:41.548
I was just saying that
I've yet to meet a writer...

41:41.758 --> 41:46.053
...who could change water into wine, and
we have a tendency to treat them like that.

41:46.388 --> 41:48.639
- As soon as you're finished.
- Not at this studio.

41:49.391 --> 41:52.142
Million, million and a half
for these scripts. It's...

41:52.310 --> 41:53.394
It's nuts.

41:53.895 --> 41:55.854
And I think avoidable.

41:56.773 --> 41:59.858
When was the last time you actually
bought a ticket to see a movie?

42:00.026 --> 42:02.903
- Actually paid your own money to see it?
- Last night.

42:03.905 --> 42:05.864
Pasadena. The Bicycle Thief.

42:06.032 --> 42:09.410
- You went to see The Bicycle Thief?
- I love that film. It's a great film.

42:09.577 --> 42:13.080
It's art movie. Doesn't count.
We're talking about "movie" movies.

42:13.248 --> 42:14.289
Jesus, people.

42:14.457 --> 42:17.459
All I'm saying is I think
a lot of time and money can be saved...

42:17.627 --> 42:19.878
...if we came up with these stories
on our own.

42:20.046 --> 42:21.755
Where are these stories coming from?

42:21.923 --> 42:24.383
Anywhere, anywhere.
It doesn't matter. Anywhere. Um...

42:24.592 --> 42:27.428
The newspaper. Pick a story. Any story.

42:29.055 --> 42:30.514
All right.

42:30.807 --> 42:33.934
"Immigrants Protest Budget Cuts
in Literacy Program."

42:34.102 --> 42:37.563
Human spirit overcoming adversity.
Horatio Alger in the barrio.

42:37.731 --> 42:40.441
Put Jimmy Smits in it
and you got a sexy Stand and Deliver.

42:40.608 --> 42:43.902
- Next. Come on.
- Larry, this isn't my field.

42:44.112 --> 42:47.156
Marty, it doesn't matter.
Just give it a shot. You can't lose here.

42:47.323 --> 42:49.283
Okay.

42:49.743 --> 42:53.787
How about, uh,
"Mudslide Kills 60 in Slums of Chili"?

42:54.039 --> 42:57.583
That's good. Triumph over tragedy.
Sounds like a John Boorman picture.

42:57.792 --> 43:00.669
You slap a happy ending on it,
the script will write itself.

43:00.920 --> 43:04.757
- Bon. Here, give me the paper.
- Gee, I don't know, Lar.

43:04.966 --> 43:06.550
Give it a shot.

43:08.386 --> 43:11.680
"Further Bond Losses
Push Dow Down 7. 15."

43:12.140 --> 43:14.725
- Okay.
- I see Connery as Bond.

43:14.893 --> 43:17.519
Funny. A good thing Oliver Stone
wasn't listening to you.

43:17.687 --> 43:20.147
- Where would we have been?
- We would have been spared...

43:20.315 --> 43:22.107
...having to sit through Wall Street.

43:22.275 --> 43:24.318
Marty, what did Wall Street do worldwide?

43:24.486 --> 43:27.029
Seventy, 75, maybe 80.

43:27.197 --> 43:30.449
Eighty million dollars,
a couple of Oscars. Nothing to sneeze at.

43:30.617 --> 43:33.827
Okay. I think Larry's point is well taken.
Let's move on now.

43:33.995 --> 43:37.748
Griffin, uh, can you give us an update
on the Taylor Hackford project?

43:38.166 --> 43:39.750
Griffin?

43:40.168 --> 43:41.627
Yeah.

43:42.879 --> 43:46.715
I was just thinking what an interesting
concept it is to eliminate the writer...

43:46.925 --> 43:50.260
...from the artistic process.

43:50.845 --> 43:55.224
If we can just get rid of these actors and
directors, maybe we got something here.

44:01.189 --> 44:02.648
Hello, Walter.

44:03.274 --> 44:06.026
- Make yourself at home.
- Mr. Mill.

44:06.194 --> 44:08.862
I understand you were kind of late
coming in this morning.

44:09.197 --> 44:12.533
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

44:12.742 --> 44:15.035
Appreciate your concern.

44:16.371 --> 44:18.664
What can I do for you, Walter?

44:18.873 --> 44:22.042
Don't tell me you came here
to pitch me a story.

44:22.210 --> 44:24.837
Ha, ha.
That's exactly what I've come to do.

44:25.004 --> 44:30.050
It's a good one too. It's about a writer.
Sort of. David Kahane.

44:32.554 --> 44:33.595
David Kahane.

44:33.805 --> 44:36.598
- Who's David Kahane?
- Oh, you met him.

44:37.183 --> 44:38.559
Well, I meet a lot of writers.

44:39.018 --> 44:41.979
Uh-huh. But this particular writer
that you met was murdered last night...

44:42.147 --> 44:45.816
...in back of the Rialto Theater in Pasadena.
- Murdered?

44:46.276 --> 44:49.903
Well, come to think of it,
Pasadena's as good a place to die as any.

44:51.698 --> 44:53.240
So, what's the story?

44:53.449 --> 44:55.409
Twenty-five words or less?

44:55.618 --> 44:58.745
Okay. Movie exec calls writer.

44:58.913 --> 45:02.624
Writer's girlfriend says he's at the movies.
Exec got to the movies, meets writer...

45:02.792 --> 45:07.212
...drinks with writer. Writer gets conked
and dies in 4 inches of dirty water.

45:07.422 --> 45:09.756
Movie exec is in deep shit.

45:10.925 --> 45:12.634
What do you think?

45:12.969 --> 45:15.929
That's more than 25 words
and it's bullshit.

45:17.307 --> 45:20.434
Pasadena Homicide doesn't think
it's bullshit. They got a complete report.

45:21.269 --> 45:24.521
You met Kahane at the Rialto.
You got drunk with him at a restaurant.

45:24.689 --> 45:27.941
He left before you did.
That's the last time anyone saw him alive...

45:28.109 --> 45:29.943
...except you maybe.

45:30.236 --> 45:32.321
Why are you denying this?

45:33.156 --> 45:36.533
Well, what do the police think?

45:36.784 --> 45:40.787
They think it's a botched robbery.
You know...

45:41.122 --> 45:42.623
...window of his car was busted.

45:42.832 --> 45:45.959
He surprised someone
trying to take the radio.

45:46.169 --> 45:48.503
There was a fight, he was killed.

45:48.671 --> 45:50.797
I didn't kill him, Walter...

45:51.674 --> 45:53.634
...but I went to see him.

45:54.510 --> 45:56.136
I know I said I didn't, but I did.

45:56.804 --> 45:59.890
- Why'd you lie to me?
- Well...

46:00.141 --> 46:02.351
...now's not a very good time for me.

46:02.560 --> 46:05.896
Haven't you heard the rumors?
I'm on my way out.

46:06.147 --> 46:08.982
Just what I need,
a little more controversy.

46:09.150 --> 46:10.776
Just not a good time, Walter.

46:12.153 --> 46:13.779
Look.

46:14.530 --> 46:17.991
I am in charge of studio security
in every definition of the word...

46:18.159 --> 46:21.536
...which means it is my job
to take care of a studio executive...

46:21.788 --> 46:25.457
...should he be, uh, shall we say,
under suspicion of murder...

46:25.625 --> 46:29.503
...at a time when profits are down and
the company is vulnerable for a takeover.

46:29.712 --> 46:32.798
It is my job to keep this
very, very, very, very quiet!

46:34.175 --> 46:35.884
You wanna help?

46:36.386 --> 46:39.179
- Of course.
- Then stop lying.

46:40.014 --> 46:42.849
- How many meetings did you have?
- One.

46:43.059 --> 46:45.686
- Not counting last night?
- Not counting last night.

46:45.853 --> 46:48.021
Why'd you go all the way
to Pasadena to meet?

46:48.189 --> 46:51.024
He had an idea I was interested in.
I wanted to talk to him.

46:51.192 --> 46:52.359
His girlfriend.

46:52.568 --> 46:55.696
I guess she was a friend of yours too.
Think fast!

46:55.863 --> 46:58.532
Jesus Christ, Walter,
what do you think? What is this?

46:58.741 --> 47:01.827
The third degree. If you don't like it,
wait till the police start asking.

47:01.995 --> 47:03.954
- I'll go right now.
- They'll be a lot less polite!

47:04.122 --> 47:07.749
- You come with me!
- You're acting like someone's who's guilty.

47:08.084 --> 47:09.710
You're not guilty, are you?

47:10.044 --> 47:12.045
For the last time, I'm not a murderer.

47:29.397 --> 47:31.148
Bad news?

47:31.899 --> 47:35.485
- What?
- The fax. Is it bad news?

47:35.737 --> 47:36.862
No.

47:38.448 --> 47:39.865
Business as usual.

47:41.451 --> 47:44.953
The Hollywood system
did not murder David Kahane.

47:45.371 --> 47:48.415
Not the $98-million movie,
not the $12-million actor.

47:48.583 --> 47:54.087
Not even the million-dollar deal
that David Kahane never landed.

47:54.255 --> 48:00.510
No, the most that we can pin on Hollywood
is assault with intent to kill.

48:01.012 --> 48:05.891
Because society is responsible
for this particular murder...

48:06.100 --> 48:11.688
...and it is to society that we must look
if we are to have any justice for that crime.

48:11.856 --> 48:14.149
Because someone in the night...

48:14.692 --> 48:19.613
...killed David Kahane, and that person
will have to bear the guilt.

48:20.823 --> 48:26.703
And if David were here right now,
I know in my heart that he would say:

48:27.413 --> 48:29.956
"Cut the shit, Phil.

48:30.208 --> 48:34.169
What did you learn from all of this?
Did you learn anything from this?"

48:34.420 --> 48:37.381
And I'd say,
"Uh, yeah, David, uh, I've learned a lot.

48:37.548 --> 48:40.467
We here, uh... We'll take it from here."

48:40.843 --> 48:44.638
And the next time we sell a script
for a million dollars...

48:44.931 --> 48:48.308
...the next time we nail some
shit-bag producer to the wall, we'll say:

48:48.476 --> 48:50.811
"That's another one for David Kahane."

48:54.440 --> 48:58.735
David was working on something the day
he died. I'd, uh, like to share it with you.

48:59.654 --> 49:02.656
"Blackness. A mangy dog barks.

49:03.449 --> 49:08.453
Garbage can lids are lifted
as derelicts in the street hunt for food.

49:08.663 --> 49:11.081
Buzzing, as a cheap alarm clock
goes off.

49:11.457 --> 49:14.584
Interior. Flophouse room. Early morning.

49:14.836 --> 49:17.838
A tracking shot moves
through the grimy room.

49:18.047 --> 49:21.550
Light streams in through holes
in the yellowing window shades.

49:21.759 --> 49:24.344
Moths dance in the beams of light.

49:24.554 --> 49:27.681
Track down along the floor.
The frayed rug.

49:27.849 --> 49:30.725
Stop on an old shoe.

49:30.977 --> 49:32.602
It's empty."

49:37.233 --> 49:39.025
That's as far as he got.

49:40.236 --> 49:42.529
That's the last thing he wrote.

49:43.614 --> 49:45.407
So long, Dave.

49:46.075 --> 49:47.742
Fade out.

49:48.453 --> 49:49.703
Thank you.

50:05.928 --> 50:09.222
Who are you? You're not a writer.

50:10.141 --> 50:12.392
No. I'm Griffin Mill.

50:12.602 --> 50:17.230
- We spoke the night David was...
- Blue sea, white sea. Yes.

50:17.440 --> 50:18.982
It turned out you were right.

50:19.150 --> 50:21.943
- What?
- It was a red sea.

50:22.528 --> 50:24.905
Oh. Yeah.

50:26.532 --> 50:29.159
You're the only person I know here.

50:29.744 --> 50:32.454
Listen, I'm really sorry about David.

50:32.747 --> 50:34.539
He was, uh...

50:34.957 --> 50:36.708
...a talent.

50:37.043 --> 50:39.085
You really think so?

50:39.420 --> 50:42.130
I always suspected he was...

50:42.590 --> 50:45.842
...uniquely untalented.

50:46.719 --> 50:48.094
It's nice of you to say that.

50:48.262 --> 50:51.556
- Nice of you to come. You didn't have to.
- Well, I did.

50:51.933 --> 50:55.602
You know, I was probably
the last person to see him alive.

50:55.770 --> 50:58.146
Yeah. The police told me.

50:58.606 --> 51:02.192
- Well, not quite the last, surely.
- No.

51:03.819 --> 51:06.780
I'm sure this is a terrible time for you.

51:07.114 --> 51:09.157
Is there anything you need or?

51:09.367 --> 51:11.576
No, really. I...

51:11.744 --> 51:13.995
I don't feel bad.

51:14.205 --> 51:16.957
It's like when my parents died.

51:17.124 --> 51:21.378
I didn't feel anything at all.
They were just gone.

51:22.380 --> 51:25.507
Well, I'm sure it hasn't sunk in yet.

51:25.716 --> 51:28.969
- That was years ago.
- No, I meant David.

51:29.136 --> 51:30.387
Oh.

51:30.555 --> 51:32.013
Oh, God.

51:32.223 --> 51:35.225
These people. I don't like it here.

51:35.476 --> 51:41.648
They're all expecting me to grieve
and mourn, and I can't talk to them.

51:43.150 --> 51:45.318
David's gone...

51:45.653 --> 51:47.988
...and I'm somewhere else already.

51:48.322 --> 51:51.116
- Will you take me home?
- What?

51:51.284 --> 51:53.243
Will you take me home?

51:54.036 --> 51:57.038
Sure. I'm right here.

52:33.909 --> 52:36.202
These are very interesting. I like them.

52:36.370 --> 52:40.040
- Would you like a drink?
- No, thanks.

52:40.374 --> 52:42.417
- Where do you show?
- Hmm?

52:42.585 --> 52:43.710
Gallery. What gallery?

52:43.878 --> 52:46.546
- Who's your dealer?
- I don't have a dealer.

52:46.756 --> 52:49.090
I couldn't sell these.
They're never finished.

52:49.258 --> 52:50.884
Bicky?

52:51.469 --> 52:54.179
No, thanks. They're never finished?

52:54.388 --> 52:58.683
No, they're just what I do, for myself.

52:58.893 --> 53:00.727
What I feel.

53:01.937 --> 53:04.230
You ask lots of questions, Mr. Mill.

53:04.732 --> 53:08.735
You're just like the police.
That's all they did, ask questions.

53:09.904 --> 53:11.571
They asked me a lot about you.

53:11.739 --> 53:13.531
- Did they?
- Mm-hm.

53:13.699 --> 53:17.369
How long we've known each other,
if you'd ever been to the house before.

53:17.536 --> 53:20.455
Well, I suppose they have to ask
those questions.

53:20.748 --> 53:22.415
I don't see why.

53:22.750 --> 53:25.085
Because that's what police do.

53:25.795 --> 53:28.505
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

53:29.090 --> 53:31.466
Why was it so important
to see David that night?

53:31.717 --> 53:33.593
What was so urgent?

53:35.721 --> 53:38.348
Well, he pitched me a story
a few months ago and...

53:38.599 --> 53:40.725
- The Japan story, right?
- Yes, the Japan story.

53:40.935 --> 53:44.604
I liked it at the time, but it needed work,
especially the ending.

53:44.772 --> 53:47.273
And I was sitting in my office that day...

53:47.441 --> 53:50.318
...and it suddenly occurred to me
how to make the ending work.

53:50.528 --> 53:52.612
So, what was it?

53:52.947 --> 53:56.449
- What?
- Your idea for the ending?

53:57.284 --> 53:58.785
Up.

53:59.495 --> 54:00.995
- "Up"?
- Up.

54:01.247 --> 54:04.165
- What does that mean?
- As opposed to down. Moods.

54:04.458 --> 54:07.627
You know, happy as opposed to sad,
hopeful as opposed to depressing.

54:08.546 --> 54:11.464
- What did you think of his ending?
- I never read it.

54:13.300 --> 54:15.969
- You never read it?
- Nope.

54:16.178 --> 54:18.179
I don't like reading.

54:18.472 --> 54:21.558
- Do you like books?
- I like words...

54:21.809 --> 54:23.476
...and letters...

54:23.686 --> 54:26.062
...but I'm not crazy
about complete sentences.

54:26.689 --> 54:27.814
Hmm.

54:27.982 --> 54:29.691
So, what did he think?

54:30.651 --> 54:34.195
He walked out on me, actually.
I don't think David liked me very much.

54:34.697 --> 54:38.908
I think he just didn't like happy endings.

54:42.204 --> 54:44.164
Put your face here.

54:45.541 --> 54:47.333
Great.

54:49.170 --> 54:51.713
What are you doing?
You're not gonna paint me, are you?

54:51.881 --> 54:55.049
I might put you in one of my paintings.

54:55.342 --> 54:58.678
There's one that I want to do
of an Icelandic hero.

54:58.888 --> 55:01.931
He's a thief and he's made of fire.

55:02.183 --> 55:04.517
- Hmm, but you might not like that.
- Why not?

55:05.311 --> 55:08.271
Because you're in the movies...

55:08.439 --> 55:11.357
...and in the movies, you can't
have thieves as heroes, can you?

55:11.901 --> 55:15.487
I don't know about that. We have
a long tradition of gangsters in the movies.

55:15.654 --> 55:18.865
Oh, yes, but they always have to
suffer for their crimes, don't they?

55:20.367 --> 55:22.535
We should pay for our crimes,
shouldn't we?

55:22.745 --> 55:27.332
I don't know. Knowing that you've
committed a crime is suffering enough.

55:27.541 --> 55:32.378
If you don't suffer,
maybe it wasn't a crime after all.

55:32.880 --> 55:35.381
Anyway, what difference does it make?

55:35.591 --> 55:38.718
It has nothing to do
with how things really are.

55:43.057 --> 55:44.599
You don't really believe that, do you?

55:45.976 --> 55:48.895
I don't know what I believe, Mr. Mill.

55:49.230 --> 55:52.065
That is just what I feel.

55:53.776 --> 55:57.403
You know what you are,
June whatever-your-name-is?

55:57.905 --> 55:59.364
You're a pragmatic anarchist.

56:00.616 --> 56:02.659
- Is that what I am?
- That's what you are.

56:02.910 --> 56:04.911
I never was sure.

56:09.583 --> 56:13.002
Could I just pick this up? Yeah?

56:13.170 --> 56:15.797
- Ooh, it's heavy.
- Thirty-seven ounces.

56:16.006 --> 56:18.174
Really? Oh, look, look.

56:18.425 --> 56:20.760
I wanna thank my mother,
and her mother...

56:20.970 --> 56:23.263
...and her father's mother,
who was the...

56:24.640 --> 56:27.141
- Hello.
- Hello. Ha, ha.

56:27.434 --> 56:28.893
Meet Detective Susan Avery.

56:29.103 --> 56:30.144
- How do you do?
- Hello.

56:30.396 --> 56:31.771
- My partner.
- Willa Broom.

56:31.981 --> 56:33.940
My pleasure. Let's go in here.

56:34.108 --> 56:37.026
This is the first real movie studio
Detective Avery's been to.

56:37.194 --> 56:39.946
- Oh, really?
- Well, aside from the Universal tour.

56:40.155 --> 56:42.699
When my family comes in,
I always take them out there.

56:42.950 --> 56:46.286
Been out there so often,
I kind of feel like I'm ready to direct.

56:46.453 --> 56:48.621
You'll probably do better
than the film grads...

56:48.831 --> 56:50.957
...they're handing the cameras
out to nowadays.

56:51.125 --> 56:53.793
I'm sorry I didn't call you
when I heard Kahane was dead.

56:53.961 --> 56:55.336
- Heard or read?
- Read.

56:55.546 --> 56:56.963
Why didn't you?

56:57.131 --> 57:00.508
Walter asked me the same question.
I wish I had a better answer for it...

57:00.718 --> 57:03.303
...but all I can say
is that I didn't think about it.

57:03.470 --> 57:04.929
Hmm.

57:05.723 --> 57:09.309
- How did you know where he would be?
- His wife told me...

57:09.476 --> 57:11.895
...he was seeing The Bicycle Thief.
- Girlfriend.

57:12.313 --> 57:13.646
Girlfriend.

57:13.856 --> 57:15.773
Girlfriend. I didn't know either of them.

57:15.941 --> 57:18.443
I was feeling restless.
I thought I'd go see the movie.

57:18.611 --> 57:21.821
If he was there, I was gonna
talk to him about a job he was good for.

57:21.989 --> 57:24.115
So you got to the theater,
you saw him and...?

57:24.325 --> 57:27.243
We went and had a drink
at a Japanese place he knew about.

57:27.411 --> 57:30.538
It was a wild, incredible scene.
It was like Tokyo.

57:30.748 --> 57:33.666
But he left before you did.
Why didn't you leave together?

57:33.876 --> 57:36.461
It was an incredible scene.
I was having a great time.

57:36.670 --> 57:38.338
Then why didn't you stay longer?

57:38.547 --> 57:42.675
Well, the people stopped singing and
then it was just a bar, and I don't drink.

57:42.843 --> 57:45.678
- You drank with him.
- Well, when in Rome...

57:46.347 --> 57:48.222
- Did you know him socially?
- No.

57:48.390 --> 57:49.682
- Been to his house?
- No.

57:49.892 --> 57:52.560
- Know anything about him personally?
- No.

57:52.770 --> 57:56.606
Griffin. Guess we're gonna
let you get back to work now.

57:59.234 --> 58:02.862
- Something's bothering you. What is it?
- Well, I...

58:03.072 --> 58:08.034
I just have to ask you, did you see him
in the parking lot after you left?

58:08.243 --> 58:10.036
No. I parked on the street.

58:10.204 --> 58:13.373
I drive a Range Rover
so I always feel safer when it's visible.

58:13.582 --> 58:15.792
Out on the street,
who's gonna smash a window?

58:15.960 --> 58:17.001
Hmm.

58:17.169 --> 58:20.505
If you had a shitty car, you would
have been parked in the parking lot?

58:20.714 --> 58:23.466
If I had a shitty car,
I might be a dead man.

58:24.134 --> 58:26.636
Somehow, I think
you're a little too lucky for that.

58:26.887 --> 58:28.513
Thank you.

58:28.722 --> 58:29.973
- Okay.
- Come on.

58:30.140 --> 58:32.558
- Sixty-three, Take 3, mark.
- Wait one second.

58:32.726 --> 58:34.060
Now.

58:35.145 --> 58:36.562
Action.

58:38.107 --> 58:40.566
No, goddamn it, Peterson,
you listen to me.

58:40.776 --> 58:43.903
I been around a while. I got a nose.
This situation stinks.

58:44.113 --> 58:46.155
It stinks of The Company.

58:46.407 --> 58:48.241
That's right, Peterson, the fucking CIA.

58:48.409 --> 58:50.243
- You ever heard of it?
- Lily understands.

58:50.411 --> 58:52.537
It's the kind of operation
those whiz-kid fucks...

58:52.746 --> 58:54.580
You don't understand
what he's going for.

58:54.748 --> 58:56.416
- I guess I don't.
- I find it hard...

58:56.583 --> 58:58.668
...to listen to you
when you don't understand.

58:58.919 --> 59:01.462
- Would you shut up, please? Could you?
- Oh, kiss my ass.

59:01.630 --> 59:03.089
You can't even see anything.

59:03.257 --> 59:05.591
I have to cut because
my robe caught on the drawer.

59:05.801 --> 59:08.052
- Oh, for chrissakes.
- I couldn't help it.

59:08.220 --> 59:10.471
- I like this guy. He's great.
- Scotty Glenn?

59:10.639 --> 59:13.516
- What kind of water is that?
- A cowboy, an FBI, priest, lover.

59:13.684 --> 59:14.934
Can I have some Volvic, please?

59:15.144 --> 59:18.271
- Action.
- No, goddamn...

59:18.439 --> 59:21.482
I heard the police
came to see you about this dead writer.

59:21.650 --> 59:23.151
Who was this guy?

59:23.360 --> 59:25.278
His name was David Kahane.

59:25.487 --> 59:28.281
I never heard of him.
Did we ever hire him for anything?

59:28.449 --> 59:30.742
I was thinking about it.

59:31.410 --> 59:34.120
He pitched me a story.
I went out to talk to him about it.

59:34.288 --> 59:36.247
- I don't have to endure your mouth.
- Jesus.

59:36.498 --> 59:40.710
Poor bastard. His ship is about to come in,
some black kid wants his money for crack.

59:40.878 --> 59:43.004
I'm sorry.
I don't wanna criticize you, babe...

59:43.172 --> 59:45.465
...but I'm supposed to
be having a conversation.

59:45.674 --> 59:48.634
- Are you talking to me?
- Are the cops still bothering you?

59:48.844 --> 59:51.387
- Action.
- No. No, I don't think so.

59:51.638 --> 59:55.141
Let Stuckel handle it. He'll
give them a couple passes to a screening...

59:55.309 --> 59:59.020
...where they can sit two rows behind
Michelle Pfeiffer. They'll leave you alone.

59:59.354 --> 01:00:00.855
- Griffin?
- Yes.

01:00:01.023 --> 01:00:06.027
Um, a guy named Joe Gillis called
and he said he wants you to meet him...

01:00:06.195 --> 01:00:09.363
...at the St. James Club
around 10:00 on the patio.

01:00:09.656 --> 01:00:11.407
- Know who this is?
- Never heard of him.

01:00:11.658 --> 01:00:15.161
- He said you'd know him.
- Anybody know who Joe Gillis is?

01:00:15.329 --> 01:00:18.122
He's the character William Holden
played in Sunset Boulevard.

01:00:18.290 --> 01:00:20.249
The writer who gets killed
by the movie star.

01:00:20.417 --> 01:00:22.668
- Gloria Swanson.
- That is a fantastic movie.

01:00:22.836 --> 01:00:25.463
All I know is we're doing this
my way. I happen to think...

01:00:26.924 --> 01:00:30.843
Oh, that guy. Last week he said
he was Charles Foster Kane.

01:00:31.428 --> 01:00:33.513
Week before that it was Rhett Butler.

01:00:33.722 --> 01:00:36.516
Why would they think that
I'd kill my own sister's husband?

01:00:36.683 --> 01:00:38.684
You wanna compare grosses, Bonnie?

01:00:38.852 --> 01:00:40.978
I was in love with him.

01:01:21.979 --> 01:01:23.271
Griffin?

01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:24.814
- Griffin.
- Malcolm McDowell.

01:01:24.982 --> 01:01:26.732
- Hi. How are you?
- Hi. Good to see you.

01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:30.278
Listen, the next time
you wanna badmouth me...

01:01:30.487 --> 01:01:32.905
...have the courage to do it to my face.

01:01:33.115 --> 01:01:35.408
You guys are all the same.

01:01:45.419 --> 01:01:47.837
- You love it there?
- I love it. It's just wonderful.

01:01:48.005 --> 01:01:50.464
You love your career too,
don't you? What is it, Tom?

01:01:50.716 --> 01:01:54.093
A complete disaster. Look at what
happened in Heaven's Gate with Cimino.

01:01:54.261 --> 01:01:56.762
- It just ended.
- We both are concerned about your ca...

01:01:56.930 --> 01:01:58.764
I knew an actor,
won't mention his name.

01:01:58.932 --> 01:02:01.559
MacDOWELL: Where I live, I know
how people think and how they feel.

01:02:01.727 --> 01:02:03.603
- But it's Montana.
- Montana will end you.

01:02:03.770 --> 01:02:06.439
- It ended Cimino on Heaven's Gate.
- Excuse me.

01:02:06.690 --> 01:02:07.982
Griffin Mill.

01:02:08.192 --> 01:02:10.526
- Hi. Andy Civella.
- Andy. How are you?

01:02:10.777 --> 01:02:14.280
Hey, I've got Andie MacDowell sitting
over here. You know her? She's so hot.

01:02:14.448 --> 01:02:16.616
- Come over, meet her.
- Still living in New York?

01:02:16.783 --> 01:02:19.368
Well, I couldn't live here.
I'm allergic to happiness. Ha, ha.

01:02:19.578 --> 01:02:21.037
- Andie, Griffin Mill.
- Hi, Andie.

01:02:21.205 --> 01:02:22.663
- How are you?
- She's my namesake.

01:02:22.831 --> 01:02:24.874
- How are the kids?
- She's the smart Andie...

01:02:25.042 --> 01:02:27.627
...and I'm the pretty one.
- He's wonderful. Thank you.

01:02:27.794 --> 01:02:29.670
You geniuses know each other.
Tom Oakley.

01:02:29.838 --> 01:02:32.465
- Of course we do. Hi. How are you?
- Oh, yes. Hi, Tom.

01:02:33.050 --> 01:02:35.551
Funny. I just ran into
Malcolm McDowell in the lobby.

01:02:35.719 --> 01:02:37.303
- Oh, really?
- Roddy McDowall...

01:02:37.471 --> 01:02:39.639
...is related to a cousin
of my brother-in-law.

01:02:39.806 --> 01:02:42.391
Well, I'm not related
to either one of them.

01:02:52.736 --> 01:02:54.237
If I write it, I direct it.

01:02:54.446 --> 01:02:56.822
The last three pictures you directed
were bombs.

01:02:56.990 --> 01:02:58.074
- One broke even.
- Bombs!

01:02:58.242 --> 01:03:00.326
- Thank you for the drink.
- Worst of the bunch.

01:03:00.535 --> 01:03:02.495
- I really have to go.
- You gotta go, Andie?

01:03:02.663 --> 01:03:04.830
- Come on, let's go.
- We'll walk you to the car.

01:03:04.998 --> 01:03:07.541
- No, it's okay. Don't worry about it.
- Hang on. Griffin.

01:03:07.709 --> 01:03:09.335
Griffin, we'd like to buy you a drink.

01:03:09.503 --> 01:03:11.170
- I am sorry. I can't.
- Have a drink.

01:03:11.338 --> 01:03:13.839
- I'm meeting someone. Business.
- Should've told him...

01:03:14.007 --> 01:03:16.550
...about Habeas Corpus.
- Of course, but he's busy.

01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:19.512
- Is there anyone waiting for me?
- No one's asked.

01:03:19.721 --> 01:03:23.474
Well, I'm expecting someone.
I'll, uh, be out by the pool.

01:03:23.850 --> 01:03:26.394
But he'll get back to us, right, Griffin?

01:03:26.561 --> 01:03:28.437
- Griffin.
- Andie?

01:04:02.347 --> 01:04:05.016
- Oh, sorry. Sorry, Griffin. Ha, ha.
- Jesus, Andy, it's you.

01:04:05.225 --> 01:04:07.935
- Of course it's me.
- Listen, I can't ask you to join me.

01:04:08.145 --> 01:04:11.355
- I told you, I'm meeting somebody.
- Yeah, you're meeting me.

01:04:11.523 --> 01:04:14.400
- We got some big business.
- You? You?

01:04:14.568 --> 01:04:17.278
- Why not me?
- Jesus, Andy, you think this is funny?

01:04:17.446 --> 01:04:20.114
- Think this is fucking funny?
- What are you talking about?

01:04:20.324 --> 01:04:21.949
Wouldn't she make a great Nora?

01:04:22.159 --> 01:04:24.910
God, I'd love to write
another Doll's House for her.

01:04:25.078 --> 01:04:27.705
Oh, did you meet Tom Oakley?

01:04:27.956 --> 01:04:29.248
Yes.

01:04:29.458 --> 01:04:32.084
- You mean, you didn't call me?
- No, I didn't call you.

01:04:32.627 --> 01:04:35.629
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

01:04:36.089 --> 01:04:39.383
Listen. I really am meeting somebody.

01:04:39.593 --> 01:04:41.761
There's no way I can hear a pitch
right now.

01:04:41.928 --> 01:04:44.388
- You'll have to call me tomorrow.
- No, I can't do it tomorrow.

01:04:45.766 --> 01:04:47.016
I've got a meeting at Paramount.

01:04:47.184 --> 01:04:49.477
- I've got a meeting at Universal.
- Congratulations.

01:04:49.644 --> 01:04:51.520
If you don't hear it now,
you'll lose it.

01:04:51.688 --> 01:04:53.689
- Then I lose it, all right?
- It'll take 20 seconds.

01:04:53.857 --> 01:04:56.192
- When your friend gets here...
- What friend? Who?

01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:57.818
Whoever you're gonna meet here.

01:05:00.572 --> 01:05:02.198
Twenty-five words or less.

01:05:02.407 --> 01:05:06.035
Absolutely. Tom, you...
No, you sit here, Tom. Go.

01:05:06.953 --> 01:05:08.954
District attorney's
at a moral crossroads...

01:05:09.122 --> 01:05:11.624
- Tom. Jesus Christ!
- Okay. Okay, okay. Uh...

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.835
We open outside the largest
penitentiary in California.

01:05:15.045 --> 01:05:18.422
It's night, it's raining.
A limousine comes in through the gate...

01:05:18.632 --> 01:05:21.801
...past a tight knot of demonstrators
holding a candlelight vigil.

01:05:22.010 --> 01:05:25.805
The candles under the umbrellas
make them glow like Japanese lanterns.

01:05:26.473 --> 01:05:28.808
That's nice. I haven't seen that before.
Good.

01:05:28.975 --> 01:05:32.561
A lone demonstrator, a black woman,
steps in front of the limousine.

01:05:32.771 --> 01:05:35.022
The lights illuminate her like a spirit.

01:05:35.232 --> 01:05:39.443
Her eyes fix upon
those of the sole passenger.

01:05:40.904 --> 01:05:42.822
The moment is devastating
between them.

01:05:43.031 --> 01:05:46.158
He's the DA, she's the mother
of the person that's being executed.

01:05:46.326 --> 01:05:48.786
You're good. See, I told you. He's good.

01:05:48.995 --> 01:05:50.246
- Go on.
- Okay.

01:05:50.455 --> 01:05:52.832
The DA believes in the death penalty.

01:05:53.041 --> 01:05:57.503
And the execution is a hard case.
Black, 19 and definitely guilty.

01:05:57.671 --> 01:05:59.505
We're in the greatest democracy
in the world...

01:05:59.714 --> 01:06:02.341
...and 36 percent of the people
on death row are black.

01:06:02.551 --> 01:06:04.385
- Poor, disadvantaged black.
- More. More.

01:06:04.594 --> 01:06:07.263
And he swears that
the next person he sees to die...

01:06:07.472 --> 01:06:09.849
...is gonna be smart, rich and white.

01:06:10.016 --> 01:06:12.518
- You, me, whoever.
- What a hook, huh?

01:06:12.727 --> 01:06:15.855
- Beauty hook. Cut to the chase, Tom.
- Okay. Okay, okay.

01:06:16.022 --> 01:06:20.359
Cut from the DA to
an upmarket suburban neighborhood.

01:06:20.569 --> 01:06:21.986
A couple have a fight.

01:06:22.195 --> 01:06:25.906
He leaves in a fit, gets in a car.
It's the same rainy night.

01:06:26.116 --> 01:06:28.784
The car spins out on a road,
goes into a ravine.

01:06:29.286 --> 01:06:30.870
The body is swept away.

01:06:31.037 --> 01:06:33.581
Now, when the police examine the car...

01:06:33.790 --> 01:06:36.125
...they find the brakes
have been tampered with.

01:06:36.334 --> 01:06:39.587
It's murder and the DA
decides to go for the big one.

01:06:40.088 --> 01:06:42.214
He's gonna put the wife
in the gas chamber.

01:06:42.424 --> 01:06:44.258
But the DA falls in love with the wife.

01:06:44.426 --> 01:06:47.720
Of course he falls in love, but he
puts her in the gas chamber anyway.

01:06:47.929 --> 01:06:50.639
Then he finds out the husband is alive...

01:06:50.849 --> 01:06:53.058
...that he faked his death.

01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:56.854
The DA breaks into the prison,
runs down death row...

01:06:57.063 --> 01:06:58.772
...but he gets there too late.

01:06:58.982 --> 01:07:01.317
The gas pellets have been dropped.

01:07:01.651 --> 01:07:03.319
She's dead.

01:07:03.778 --> 01:07:05.446
I'll tell you...

01:07:05.822 --> 01:07:07.907
...there's not a dry eye in the house.

01:07:08.450 --> 01:07:10.701
- She's dead?
- She's dead.

01:07:10.911 --> 01:07:14.413
She's dead.
Because that's the reality.

01:07:14.623 --> 01:07:17.082
The innocent die.

01:07:18.126 --> 01:07:20.753
- Who's the DA?
- Ah. No one.

01:07:20.962 --> 01:07:23.214
- No one?
- "No stars on this project."

01:07:23.381 --> 01:07:27.801
- We're going out on a limb on this one.
- You know, like unknown stage actors...

01:07:27.969 --> 01:07:29.929
...or maybe somebody English
like what's-his-name.

01:07:30.096 --> 01:07:31.388
Mm-hm.

01:07:32.724 --> 01:07:34.642
- Why?
- Why? Why?

01:07:34.851 --> 01:07:37.645
Because this story
is just too damned important...

01:07:37.812 --> 01:07:39.813
...to risk being overwhelmed
by personality.

01:07:40.023 --> 01:07:42.733
Yeah, that's fine for action pictures,
but this is special.

01:07:42.901 --> 01:07:44.568
We want real people here.

01:07:44.778 --> 01:07:47.613
We don't want people coming in
with any preconceived notions.

01:07:47.822 --> 01:07:51.367
- We want them to see a district attorney.
- Bruce Willis.

01:07:51.576 --> 01:07:54.245
No. Not Bruce Willis, not Kevin Costner.

01:07:54.454 --> 01:07:57.289
This is an innocent woman
fighting for her life.

01:07:57.457 --> 01:07:59.166
- Julia Roberts.
- If we can get her.

01:07:59.376 --> 01:08:01.877
- Of course we can get her.
- If I'm perfectly honest...

01:08:02.045 --> 01:08:05.339
...if I think about this,
this isn't even an American film.

01:08:07.592 --> 01:08:10.844
- It's not?
- No, no. There are no stars.

01:08:11.054 --> 01:08:12.596
No pat happy endings.

01:08:12.764 --> 01:08:16.559
No Schwarzenegger, no stickups,
no terrorists.

01:08:16.768 --> 01:08:20.479
This is a tough story. A tragedy
in which an innocent woman dies.

01:08:20.647 --> 01:08:24.524
Why? Because that happens.

01:08:26.819 --> 01:08:28.821
Habeas Corpus.

01:08:29.029 --> 01:08:31.865
That's what we're calling it.
"Produce the corpse."

01:08:32.075 --> 01:08:33.576
What do you say? Yes or no?

01:08:34.743 --> 01:08:36.495
That pitch was more than 25 words.

01:08:36.705 --> 01:08:39.582
Yeah, but it's brilliant.
What's the verdict, Griffin?

01:08:39.791 --> 01:08:41.792
Mr. Mill, for you.

01:08:42.419 --> 01:08:45.212
- Who gave this to you?
- I received it at the front desk.

01:08:45.421 --> 01:08:47.046
What is it?

01:08:50.301 --> 01:08:51.801
It's, um...

01:08:51.970 --> 01:08:55.139
It's from the person I was meeting.
He's not coming.

01:08:55.307 --> 01:08:57.558
Well, do we have a shot? Griffin.

01:08:57.767 --> 01:09:00.269
It's an intriguing idea.
Give me a call at the studio.

01:09:00.437 --> 01:09:01.770
- Yeah!
- There's a scene...

01:09:01.938 --> 01:09:04.023
...in Throne of Blood
that has exactly the texture.

01:09:04.189 --> 01:09:06.692
- Tom. Just say "thank you."
- If you wanna... Okay.

01:09:06.859 --> 01:09:08.277
She has to die. No Hollywood ending.

01:09:08.444 --> 01:09:10.237
- Tom, "thank you," say.
- God!

01:11:05.645 --> 01:11:08.605
Fuck you! You fucking dog-shit writer!

01:11:08.815 --> 01:11:10.232
You fucking try to kill me!

01:11:11.568 --> 01:11:12.609
Fuck.

01:11:34.007 --> 01:11:37.301
Oh, God. You gave me such a scare.

01:11:37.510 --> 01:11:39.344
What are you doing here?

01:11:40.722 --> 01:11:43.932
You gave me such a fright. Come in.

01:11:44.434 --> 01:11:46.018
Come on in.

01:11:47.729 --> 01:11:51.565
What's the matter? You look terrible.

01:11:51.983 --> 01:11:53.275
What's up?

01:11:55.904 --> 01:11:58.030
Sit down. I'll get you a drink.

01:12:09.250 --> 01:12:11.168
Something happened?

01:12:12.504 --> 01:12:13.837
Is it too late? I...

01:12:14.047 --> 01:12:15.047
- No, no, no.
- Sorry.

01:12:15.215 --> 01:12:16.757
It's not too late. No.

01:12:16.966 --> 01:12:20.719
- I don't even know what time it is.
- What's wrong?

01:12:26.226 --> 01:12:28.060
What are you painting? Is that me?

01:12:28.228 --> 01:12:31.146
Yep. It's you.

01:12:32.816 --> 01:12:34.149
See?

01:12:34.359 --> 01:12:36.610
Do you have snakes in Iceland?

01:12:36.778 --> 01:12:38.570
Snakes? No, I don't think so, no.

01:12:38.822 --> 01:12:40.447
Are you afraid of snakes?

01:12:40.615 --> 01:12:43.450
I don't know.
I've never come close to a real one.

01:12:43.660 --> 01:12:45.828
They scare the shit out of me.

01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:55.546
- Here, have another.
- I don't usually drink.

01:12:59.342 --> 01:13:01.885
Something happened tonight.

01:13:02.470 --> 01:13:04.638
Yes, but, uh...

01:13:06.558 --> 01:13:09.226
...there's something else
I have to tell you.

01:13:11.729 --> 01:13:13.897
This isn't easy for me.

01:13:15.275 --> 01:13:16.358
Yes?

01:13:23.199 --> 01:13:25.868
How about if I just
get on with my work...

01:13:26.494 --> 01:13:30.414
...and you talk to me
when you feel like, okay?

01:13:37.088 --> 01:13:39.756
I came very close to dying tonight.

01:13:43.469 --> 01:13:45.095
All I could think about was you.

01:13:46.723 --> 01:13:48.932
I don't even know you.

01:13:49.642 --> 01:13:52.019
But you came into my mind...

01:13:54.355 --> 01:13:58.650
...and I couldn't...
I couldn't think of anything else.

01:14:01.738 --> 01:14:04.489
Remember that first night
we spoke on the phone?

01:14:06.826 --> 01:14:09.036
I was outside these windows...

01:14:10.330 --> 01:14:12.623
...watching you and, um...

01:14:15.460 --> 01:14:18.170
It was so exciting and so...

01:14:19.672 --> 01:14:21.757
...new and...

01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:25.844
...strange.

01:14:28.765 --> 01:14:31.516
I can't get you out of my mind.

01:14:34.604 --> 01:14:37.272
Are you making love to me?

01:14:39.817 --> 01:14:42.194
Yes, I guess I am.

01:14:43.696 --> 01:14:45.572
I guess I am.

01:14:49.035 --> 01:14:58.043
I wanna make love to you.

01:14:59.087 --> 01:15:01.046
It's too soon.

01:15:04.342 --> 01:15:06.593
It's too soon, isn't it?

01:15:08.554 --> 01:15:11.139
It's so strange how things happen.

01:15:13.142 --> 01:15:15.227
David was here...

01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:17.479
...then he left.

01:15:18.606 --> 01:15:20.607
You arrived.

01:15:22.986 --> 01:15:25.779
Maybe it's just the timing,
but I feel like...

01:15:25.947 --> 01:15:29.533
...I would go anywhere with you...

01:15:30.827 --> 01:15:32.744
...if you asked.

01:15:36.499 --> 01:15:38.750
But we mustn't hurry things.

01:15:38.918 --> 01:15:44.881
You know, we can't hurry things
any more than we can stop them.

01:15:47.093 --> 01:15:49.386
I think you better go now.

01:15:49.721 --> 01:15:52.139
I think I'm going to cry now.

01:15:56.602 --> 01:15:59.146
Better go, quick.

01:16:05.361 --> 01:16:06.737
I'm sorry.

01:16:06.946 --> 01:16:10.282
No, no, no, don't be sorry.
Just go home...

01:16:10.908 --> 01:16:13.035
...and get some sleep...

01:16:13.745 --> 01:16:15.370
...and call me.

01:16:16.289 --> 01:16:17.956
Tomorrow.

01:16:19.250 --> 01:16:21.710
Invite me on a proper date.

01:16:22.795 --> 01:16:24.671
I'd like that.

01:16:39.687 --> 01:16:41.188
Jan?

01:16:41.481 --> 01:16:42.481
- Jan!
- Yeah?

01:16:42.648 --> 01:16:44.107
Get Larry Levy on the phone.

01:16:44.275 --> 01:16:47.069
- I don't think he's on the lot.
- Try his car.

01:16:47.820 --> 01:16:48.945
Isn't he at Fox?

01:16:49.155 --> 01:16:51.156
He used to be. Not anymore.

01:16:51.324 --> 01:16:54.618
I pitched him something a few months ago
and he hated it.

01:16:55.119 --> 01:16:57.245
- Yeah, Griffin.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:16:57.413 --> 01:16:58.872
Listen, I've got Tom Oakley...

01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:01.833
...and Andy Civella.
I wouldn't be bothering you if I didn't...

01:17:02.085 --> 01:17:04.002
...think they had an idea
you should hear.

01:17:04.170 --> 01:17:06.588
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Larry.

01:17:06.798 --> 01:17:09.591
Uh, the next voice you're gonna hear
has got an English accent.

01:17:09.801 --> 01:17:11.635
Tom Oakley. I'm Andy Civella.

01:17:11.844 --> 01:17:14.304
Hi, Andy. I know Tom.
How are you, Tom?

01:17:14.472 --> 01:17:16.473
Uh, very well, Larry. And yourself?

01:17:16.849 --> 01:17:18.642
Fine. What's your story?

01:17:19.727 --> 01:17:22.437
We open outside San Quentin. It's night.

01:17:24.023 --> 01:17:26.983
It's raining.
A limousine enters through the front gate...

01:17:27.151 --> 01:17:31.321
...past a tight knot of demonstrators holding
a candlelight vigil. The candles are...

01:17:31.531 --> 01:17:34.699
...flickering underneath the umbrellas,
glowing like Japanese lanterns.

01:17:35.201 --> 01:17:38.495
A lone demonstrator, black woman,
steps in front of the limousine.

01:17:38.704 --> 01:17:41.039
Her eyes connect
with the lone passenger.

01:17:41.249 --> 01:17:45.710
It's a devastating moment
for both of them. Incredibly potent.

01:17:47.713 --> 01:17:51.216
No stars, no Schwarzenegger,
no pat Hollywood endings...

01:17:51.384 --> 01:17:54.511
...no car chases.
This is an American tragedy...

01:17:54.720 --> 01:17:56.680
...in which an innocent woman dies.

01:17:56.889 --> 01:18:00.559
Because that happens. That's reality.

01:18:01.602 --> 01:18:03.895
Take me off the speakerphone, Griffin.

01:18:05.189 --> 01:18:06.314
Yeah?

01:18:06.524 --> 01:18:11.027
I don't know. It's a really hot story,
but what is this bullshit, no stars?

01:18:11.237 --> 01:18:15.073
Let me give you a little tip, Larry.
Levison came to power on two movies.

01:18:15.241 --> 01:18:17.534
They made $300 million
and had no stars in them.

01:18:17.702 --> 01:18:20.162
He's gonna love this idea.
It'll remind him of his youth.

01:18:20.329 --> 01:18:23.373
You know what his motto used to be?
No stars, just talent.

01:18:23.583 --> 01:18:27.294
- Has anyone else heard this?
- I don't think so. No.

01:18:28.045 --> 01:18:29.379
We should make a deal now.

01:18:29.755 --> 01:18:32.507
Tomorrow may be too late.
Can we get ahold of Levison?

01:18:32.717 --> 01:18:35.093
Yeah, I'll get Levison.
Uh, when can you be back?

01:18:35.303 --> 01:18:37.804
- I'll be there right after my AA meeting.
- Oh, Larry.

01:18:37.972 --> 01:18:40.348
I didn't realize you, uh,
had a drinking problem.

01:18:40.516 --> 01:18:41.725
Well...

01:18:41.934 --> 01:18:46.438
...I don't really, but that's where all the
deals are being made these days. See you.

01:18:48.316 --> 01:18:51.568
Tom, that was a hell of a pitch.

01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:54.905
Good work. I think you sold Larry.

01:18:55.114 --> 01:18:57.282
Great. When are we gonna hear?

01:18:57.450 --> 01:18:59.951
I want you to go home,
put some champagne on ice.

01:19:00.119 --> 01:19:01.786
I'll give you an answer by tonight.

01:19:01.954 --> 01:19:05.582
- Jan, come in here.
- Griffin, you move in mysterious ways...

01:19:05.791 --> 01:19:08.460
...but I like it. I like it.
- Okay.

01:19:08.628 --> 01:19:10.420
Did Levy understand? No stars?

01:19:10.588 --> 01:19:13.048
Yes, he was particularly attracted
to that notion.

01:19:13.257 --> 01:19:16.051
- No Hollywood ending?
- No Hollywood ending.

01:19:18.554 --> 01:19:20.472
They looked happy.

01:19:20.932 --> 01:19:23.725
They have a completely fucked-up idea
that has no second act.

01:19:23.893 --> 01:19:26.645
If I hadn't heard it myself,
I never would have believed it.

01:19:26.812 --> 01:19:29.981
Larry Levy liked it
because he's a dick-brain.

01:19:30.149 --> 01:19:32.317
Levy will sell the idea to Levison...

01:19:32.485 --> 01:19:35.070
...and then I will let Levison
have the brilliant idea...

01:19:35.238 --> 01:19:38.406
...of letting Larry
take over the project for me.

01:19:38.574 --> 01:19:39.783
You will?

01:19:39.992 --> 01:19:42.744
See, Levison can't wait
to get in bed with Levy.

01:19:43.329 --> 01:19:47.082
This piece-of-shit idea
will blow up in both their faces.

01:19:47.291 --> 01:19:51.503
And then I will step in and save the day.

01:19:53.673 --> 01:19:55.590
- Score!
- Yes!

01:19:56.467 --> 01:19:58.343
Three points.

01:19:58.803 --> 01:20:00.553
Great shot.

01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:06.309
She's receiving the last rites.

01:20:06.477 --> 01:20:09.062
The DA discovers that
the husband faked his own death.

01:20:09.230 --> 01:20:12.524
She's innocent. He races to
the penitentiary, but it's too late.

01:20:12.692 --> 01:20:15.026
The pellets have dropped. She's dead.

01:20:15.278 --> 01:20:17.779
He helped kill the woman he loved.

01:20:17.989 --> 01:20:21.283
- Who are the stars?
- No stars, just talent.

01:20:21.659 --> 01:20:23.326
No stars?

01:20:23.536 --> 01:20:27.205
What kind of ending do you call that?
It's depressing. It'll bring everybody down.

01:20:27.373 --> 01:20:29.624
Depressing? Joel, what about
Terms of Endearment?

01:20:29.834 --> 01:20:31.334
Love Story? Steel Magnolias?

01:20:31.544 --> 01:20:33.003
E.T. Grossed what? What, Marty?

01:20:33.170 --> 01:20:36.548
Three hundred nineteen million dollars.
There wasn't a dry eye in the house.

01:20:36.716 --> 01:20:39.050
- Depressing? I don't think so.
- Yeah, but...

01:20:39.218 --> 01:20:41.928
Normally I'd agree,
but this is an entirely different deal.

01:20:42.096 --> 01:20:44.139
It is a matter of taking a risk.

01:20:44.348 --> 01:20:45.849
Rolling the dice.

01:20:46.058 --> 01:20:48.977
But if they come up seven, bingo.

01:20:50.062 --> 01:20:51.313
It's Oscar time.

01:20:52.565 --> 01:20:54.774
- Do they screw?
- Who?

01:20:54.942 --> 01:20:57.360
The DA, whoever it is, and the woman.
Do they screw?

01:20:57.528 --> 01:21:01.698
If I'm looking at jail cells and gas chambers,
we're gonna have sex in this picture.

01:21:01.866 --> 01:21:04.075
Sure, of course.
We'll get it there. No problem.

01:21:04.243 --> 01:21:07.746
Okay. Who's gonna shepherd
this thing?

01:21:09.582 --> 01:21:12.375
Larry, you have a good feel for this.
You wanna run with it?

01:21:12.585 --> 01:21:14.544
Wait. This project originated
with Griffin.

01:21:14.712 --> 01:21:16.755
- Bonnie.
- Oh, no. I don't wanna dance...

01:21:16.922 --> 01:21:20.675
...in somebody else's wedding.
If it's Griffin's project, it's Griffin's project.

01:21:20.843 --> 01:21:24.095
- I just think we should write...
- Bonnie, this'll have to be my call.

01:21:26.098 --> 01:21:27.891
It's fine with me.

01:21:28.100 --> 01:21:31.728
My plate is full anyway.
Larry, it's yours.

01:21:32.271 --> 01:21:34.898
Hit a home run.
Win an Oscar for the home team.

01:21:37.276 --> 01:21:39.110
- I've got something else for you.
- Yeah?

01:21:39.278 --> 01:21:40.570
- New York tomorrow.
- Yeah?

01:21:40.780 --> 01:21:43.114
Tom Wolfe's book will be
at the Sherry-Netherlands.

01:21:43.282 --> 01:21:44.991
- Read it, make your bid.
- Send Bonnie.

01:21:45.159 --> 01:21:47.619
She'll know if it's a movie.
If it is, bid a million.

01:21:47.787 --> 01:21:50.622
- Me?
- A million? Oh, that's kind of high, isn't it?

01:21:51.957 --> 01:21:53.708
- It's Tom Wolfe. Why not you?
- Yeah?

01:21:53.876 --> 01:21:55.835
I'm a story editor.
That's a vice president's job.

01:21:56.003 --> 01:21:59.089
- You don't wanna be vice president?
- Bonnie. Pack your bags.

01:21:59.590 --> 01:22:01.216
- Congratulations.
- Yeah?

01:22:01.425 --> 01:22:03.843
That was the most amazing pitch
I've ever heard.

01:22:04.011 --> 01:22:06.763
- If you don't want the responsibility, fine.
- No, I'm going.

01:22:06.972 --> 01:22:08.681
I really wanna be one of your soldiers.

01:22:08.849 --> 01:22:10.809
I'm glad you're on the team,
believe me.

01:22:10.976 --> 01:22:13.895
- Thank you for the support.
- Bonnie's gonna be gone. I'm here.

01:22:14.814 --> 01:22:16.648
Whitney, now.

01:22:17.942 --> 01:22:19.401
Frank, Marty. You wanna come in?

01:22:20.945 --> 01:22:22.654
- May I have a word?
- I have a meeting.

01:22:22.905 --> 01:22:25.323
- Find the time. What is going on?
- What do you mean?

01:22:25.574 --> 01:22:28.243
I mean, handing Larry Levy
your project like that.

01:22:28.452 --> 01:22:30.912
Well, I just thought Larry had...

01:22:31.122 --> 01:22:33.665
...a firm grasp on...

01:22:33.833 --> 01:22:36.167
...the style of the piece.
- The only thing Levy...

01:22:36.335 --> 01:22:38.461
...has a firm grasp on is his dick.
You know it.

01:22:38.629 --> 01:22:40.338
I'm not Oz. I can't do everything.

01:22:40.506 --> 01:22:43.591
If Larry has what it takes to
get a picture made, why not use him?

01:22:43.759 --> 01:22:45.635
- Everybody wins.
- Why bullshit me?

01:22:45.803 --> 01:22:49.139
- I'm not bullshitting you.
- Yes, you are. Griffin, I know you.

01:22:49.306 --> 01:22:51.558
I know you.
You've been stringing me along...

01:22:51.767 --> 01:22:53.852
- Habeas Corpus, Griffin.
- Habeas Corpus.

01:22:54.061 --> 01:22:56.104
Habeas Corpus.

01:22:56.689 --> 01:22:59.274
You've been stringing me along
like one of your writers.

01:22:59.442 --> 01:23:01.985
What is this, getting Levison to send me?
What is that?

01:23:02.153 --> 01:23:04.571
- Are you trying to get rid of me?
- Get rid of you?

01:23:04.738 --> 01:23:06.739
I'm trying to help you.
If you score in New York...

01:23:06.907 --> 01:23:09.242
...Levison has to make you
a vice president.

01:23:09.410 --> 01:23:12.495
Jesus, Bonnie, what's the matter?
Are you afraid of success?

01:23:12.705 --> 01:23:16.332
- Are you seeing someone else?
- Oh. That's what this is about?

01:23:16.500 --> 01:23:17.750
- It's not just this.
- Jesus.

01:23:17.918 --> 01:23:20.211
It's a lot of things.
The way you've been acting.

01:23:20.379 --> 01:23:22.505
Something is going on.
I wanna know what it is.

01:23:22.673 --> 01:23:24.132
- Jesus Christ.
- You're not even...

01:23:24.300 --> 01:23:26.551
You're not even looking at me
when you're talking.

01:23:26.719 --> 01:23:30.221
I want you to look at me. Please look
me right in the eyes and just tell me.

01:23:30.473 --> 01:23:34.142
No bullshit. Is there someone else?

01:23:34.310 --> 01:23:35.894
No.

01:23:38.147 --> 01:23:40.023
Have a good trip.

01:23:46.530 --> 01:23:50.200
Our top story this evening
involves Hollywood's three favorite G's.

01:23:50.409 --> 01:23:53.244
A glamorous, glitzy,
gala night on the town.

01:23:53.496 --> 01:23:57.874
It is a who's who of stars,
no IDs necessary. Household names...

01:23:58.083 --> 01:24:00.418
...one and all.
Leeza Gibbons reporting here.

01:24:00.669 --> 01:24:04.380
And right this minute, you could fire
a cannon down Sunset Boulevard...

01:24:04.590 --> 01:24:06.758
...and not come close
to hitting a celebrity.

01:24:06.926 --> 01:24:09.469
Everybody who is anybody is right here...

01:24:09.720 --> 01:24:12.889
...rubbing elbows and making big talk
in this ballroom.

01:24:13.098 --> 01:24:14.599
All the movers, all the shakers.

01:24:14.767 --> 01:24:16.726
Behind the scenes and on the screens.

01:24:17.102 --> 01:24:19.896
We'll leave it to Cher
to wear fire-engine red...

01:24:20.105 --> 01:24:22.315
...when the impossible-to-come-by
invitations...

01:24:22.566 --> 01:24:24.651
...call for black and white only, please.

01:24:24.818 --> 01:24:27.237
- Hello, nice to see you.
- Hi, Teri. Nice to see you.

01:24:27.446 --> 01:24:28.613
- June Gudmundsdottir.
- Hi.

01:24:28.781 --> 01:24:30.198
- Teri Garr. Buck Henry.
- Hello.

01:24:30.366 --> 01:24:31.783
The occasion this evening...

01:24:31.951 --> 01:24:34.285
...just as big and important
as the all-star turnout.

01:24:34.495 --> 01:24:38.414
The studio world-famous for the slogan
"Movies, now more than ever"...

01:24:38.624 --> 01:24:43.002
...is donating prints of 25 of its classic
black-and-white films to the museum.

01:24:43.254 --> 01:24:47.298
Now, they'll be able to say,
"Movies, now more than ever, forever."

01:24:47.508 --> 01:24:48.800
Thank you.

01:24:49.301 --> 01:24:54.639
It's wonderful to see so many
familiar and friendly faces around.

01:24:54.807 --> 01:25:00.144
As you know, the L.A. County Museum
has always been close to our hearts.

01:25:00.354 --> 01:25:03.064
And especially the Motion Department...

01:25:03.232 --> 01:25:05.733
Uh, Motion Picture Department.

01:25:06.986 --> 01:25:10.488
Uh, we're happy to make possible
this donation.

01:25:11.031 --> 01:25:15.618
Now I'd like to introduce the man
whose idea this all was.

01:25:15.828 --> 01:25:17.495
Griffin Mill. Please.

01:25:24.336 --> 01:25:26.337
Thank you, Joel.

01:25:27.131 --> 01:25:28.464
Grab another drink.

01:25:33.012 --> 01:25:35.346
I'd like to extend my thanks...

01:25:35.514 --> 01:25:37.849
...to the patrons of
the Los Angeles County Museum.

01:25:38.684 --> 01:25:41.978
You have long fostered
the art of motion pictures...

01:25:42.187 --> 01:25:46.899
...as a serious and valuable art form
in this community.

01:25:47.151 --> 01:25:49.902
Many people across the country
and around the world...

01:25:50.154 --> 01:25:54.073
...have for too long thought of movies
as a popular entertainment...

01:25:54.325 --> 01:25:56.534
...more than a serious art.

01:25:56.785 --> 01:26:00.913
And I'm afraid a large majority
of the press supports this attitude.

01:26:01.165 --> 01:26:04.876
We want great films
with long shelf lives.

01:26:05.044 --> 01:26:07.503
We want the films
of the new John Hustons...

01:26:07.713 --> 01:26:10.548
...Orson Welles, Frank Capra.

01:26:10.799 --> 01:26:15.887
We and the other major film studios
have a responsibility to the public...

01:26:16.055 --> 01:26:19.932
...to maintain the art
of motion pictures...

01:26:20.184 --> 01:26:22.894
...as our primary mandate.

01:26:23.187 --> 01:26:26.314
Movies are art...

01:26:26.523 --> 01:26:29.734
...now more than ever.

01:26:30.694 --> 01:26:32.111
Thank you.

01:26:39.912 --> 01:26:42.872
Griffin, a hell of a job.
I couldn't have done it better myself.

01:26:43.082 --> 01:26:45.708
I'll know all of your lines soon.

01:26:47.628 --> 01:26:52.048
- Well, are we having fun yet?
- I'm having a great time.

01:26:56.595 --> 01:26:58.429
Yes, I do.

01:26:58.639 --> 01:27:00.556
I did too.

01:27:06.271 --> 01:27:08.856
Is this a friend of a friend?

01:27:09.024 --> 01:27:10.817
- I'm sorry.
- How did you meet?

01:27:10.984 --> 01:27:14.070
How did we meet?
Well, at a funeral. Yes.

01:27:14.279 --> 01:27:16.989
- Isn't that right? Funeral?
- Absolutely. Excuse us.

01:27:17.241 --> 01:27:20.284
Steve. Steve, whose daughter is he with?

01:27:20.452 --> 01:27:21.786
Seriously, I...

01:27:23.163 --> 01:27:25.707
I think she's with his cousin...

01:27:25.874 --> 01:27:28.000
Said he was sure
she was somebody's daughter.

01:27:28.168 --> 01:27:30.920
- I wanna know whose daughter she was.
- No. I don't know.

01:27:52.526 --> 01:27:54.402
BOTH CHUCKLING]

01:27:55.654 --> 01:27:58.656
- Don't make a scene.
- You're doing it all wrong. Ha, ha.

01:27:59.491 --> 01:28:00.700
Here we go.

01:28:00.868 --> 01:28:03.828
Oops. That was a good one.

01:28:04.997 --> 01:28:08.541
Well, that's what I call a real date.

01:28:13.464 --> 01:28:15.339
Should I come in?

01:28:15.716 --> 01:28:17.925
Uh, well...

01:28:18.093 --> 01:28:20.511
- Hmm, well...
- Not tonight.

01:28:20.679 --> 01:28:22.847
- No, not tonight.
- But soon.

01:28:24.183 --> 01:28:26.142
Very soon.

01:28:28.479 --> 01:28:30.688
- How about Mexico?
- Mexico?

01:28:30.939 --> 01:28:32.523
Neutral territory. Acapulco.

01:28:32.733 --> 01:28:34.317
I've never been to Acapulco.

01:28:34.526 --> 01:28:35.735
We'll go.

01:28:35.903 --> 01:28:38.112
- Is that the thing to do?
- That's a thing to do.

01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:40.948
- Let's do it, then.
- We'll go this weekend.

01:28:41.158 --> 01:28:42.700
Really?

01:28:45.370 --> 01:28:48.456
- Do I need a passport?
- Yes.

01:29:37.005 --> 01:29:40.258
Mr. Mill, I'm Detective DeLongpre,
Pasadena Police.

01:29:40.425 --> 01:29:42.093
Yes, I recognize you.

01:29:42.261 --> 01:29:44.554
Did you have a good time
at the party last night?

01:29:44.721 --> 01:29:48.432
No, I didn't. I'm not supposed to
have a good time when I'm on duty.

01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:51.060
Great, well, what do you want,
Detective DeLongpre?

01:29:51.270 --> 01:29:54.105
- I'd like you to come down to the station.
- Why?

01:29:54.314 --> 01:29:56.315
- To look at some pictures.
- Pictures?

01:29:56.567 --> 01:29:59.902
Mug shots.
You know, like in the movies.

01:30:00.070 --> 01:30:02.989
Ah, mug shots. Yes, well, all right.

01:30:03.156 --> 01:30:05.116
- Will you follow me to Pasadena?
- Pasadena.

01:30:05.325 --> 01:30:06.951
- Pasadena.
- Right.

01:30:07.119 --> 01:30:09.787
Will you fasten your safety belt, please?

01:30:13.959 --> 01:30:15.293
- Come, let's go.
- No!

01:30:15.460 --> 01:30:17.461
- Take your hands off her!
- Hush.

01:30:17.671 --> 01:30:19.839
- I want my baby.
- Where's her baby at?

01:30:20.090 --> 01:30:21.883
- Let me go!
- No.

01:30:22.050 --> 01:30:23.968
- Mr. Mill.
- Hello. How are you?

01:30:24.136 --> 01:30:26.220
Good to see you.
Everybody, this is Mr. Mill.

01:30:26.388 --> 01:30:29.974
- Good to see you again.
- He makes movies. Have a seat, Mr. Mill.

01:30:30.392 --> 01:30:33.311
Where the fuck is he going?
Excuse, me, sir. Mr. Mill. Mr. Mill.

01:30:33.520 --> 01:30:35.521
Not in here.
This is my lieutenant's office.

01:30:35.731 --> 01:30:38.691
- Have a seat in my seat. Right here.
- I'm sorry.

01:30:39.192 --> 01:30:40.234
All right, now.

01:30:40.402 --> 01:30:42.653
Uh... Willa.

01:30:42.863 --> 01:30:43.905
- Could you?
- Sorry.

01:30:44.156 --> 01:30:45.865
Your desk. Thank you.

01:30:46.116 --> 01:30:47.491
Sorry. Have a seat, Mr. Mill.

01:30:47.701 --> 01:30:50.077
Listen, um, before we start, I just...

01:30:50.245 --> 01:30:53.247
Paul went to see a movie last night
he came in here raving about.

01:30:53.498 --> 01:30:54.957
What was the name of that movie?

01:30:55.125 --> 01:30:57.668
Changed the lady into a chicken
at the end. What did you see?

01:30:57.836 --> 01:30:59.420
- Freaks.
- Freaks.

01:30:59.671 --> 01:31:01.714
- Have you seen this?
- Tod Browning. Yes.

01:31:01.924 --> 01:31:05.760
"One of us, one of us, one of us,
one of us."

01:31:05.928 --> 01:31:08.179
He came in doing that.
He was raving about it.

01:31:08.388 --> 01:31:12.516
He loved it. He loved it. It was thrilling
for me. Um, Willa. Excuse me.

01:31:12.684 --> 01:31:15.519
Did you happen to see where the tampons
went that were in here?

01:31:15.687 --> 01:31:18.648
- Because I can't seem to find them.
- I didn't take them.

01:31:18.857 --> 01:31:20.149
Who took them? Did he?

01:31:20.359 --> 01:31:22.151
- I don't know. I didn't.
- Who did?

01:31:22.361 --> 01:31:25.196
- I didn't take them.
- You see this? Damn.

01:31:26.531 --> 01:31:29.033
Um, so do you have a break in the case?

01:31:29.242 --> 01:31:31.035
Oh, what makes you say that?

01:31:31.203 --> 01:31:34.038
Well, why else
would you bring me here?

01:31:35.290 --> 01:31:36.415
Why else, indeed.

01:31:37.793 --> 01:31:43.214
Paul. Paul, why have you brought Mr. Mill
in here today?

01:31:43.382 --> 01:31:45.883
- To look at some pictures.
- Willa.

01:31:46.385 --> 01:31:47.927
Pictures?

01:31:48.178 --> 01:31:52.807
Listen, could you...? If you remember,
what were you, uh, wearing that night?

01:31:53.058 --> 01:31:56.894
I was wearing a double-breasted suit,
I believe.

01:31:57.729 --> 01:31:59.563
Oh, it's all right. What's the matter?

01:31:59.731 --> 01:32:02.233
- Mr. Mill, you're so jumpy. Sit down.
- I'll get it.

01:32:02.401 --> 01:32:05.945
No, no, she... That's what she's here for.
It's all right. Have a seat.

01:32:06.196 --> 01:32:07.822
- Sorry.
- No problem.

01:32:08.490 --> 01:32:09.907
Okay.

01:32:10.075 --> 01:32:12.076
Will you take a look at this gentle...?

01:32:12.285 --> 01:32:13.786
- Where were they?
- Right here.

01:32:13.996 --> 01:32:16.497
She found them, look.
You're right. Ha, ha.

01:32:16.748 --> 01:32:19.458
Oh, wait a minute. No, no.
These aren't mine.

01:32:19.626 --> 01:32:21.669
These are slender regular.
These are yours.

01:32:21.837 --> 01:32:23.254
Yeah, I guess you have jumbo.

01:32:24.589 --> 01:32:26.465
Well, I do use jumbo. These are not mine.

01:32:26.842 --> 01:32:29.510
God. Just trying to help you out.

01:32:29.678 --> 01:32:33.305
Um, look, did you see this guy
the night of the murder?

01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:38.019
Sorry, ha, ha. Um...

01:32:38.186 --> 01:32:41.772
No. Uh, you're putting me
in a terrible position here.

01:32:41.940 --> 01:32:43.816
I would hate to get
the wrong person arrested.

01:32:43.984 --> 01:32:47.236
Oh, please. This is Pasadena.
We do not arrest the wrong person.

01:32:47.446 --> 01:32:50.573
That's L.A. See, L.A., they kick
your ass and then they arrest you.

01:32:50.741 --> 01:32:53.409
That's what they do. We don't do that.
Remember last year?

01:32:53.577 --> 01:32:55.953
What was that guy's name?
They put him on the tape.

01:32:56.163 --> 01:32:57.455
- King.
- That's right, King.

01:32:57.664 --> 01:32:59.874
- BLT.
- He was the wrong guy.

01:33:03.128 --> 01:33:05.880
- Do you have a witness?
- Now, I can't answer that.

01:33:06.131 --> 01:33:10.217
Well, either you have a witness
or these are suspects in similar murders.

01:33:10.385 --> 01:33:12.636
Mr. Mill, have you been going
to detective school?

01:33:12.846 --> 01:33:17.224
No, actually, we're doing a movie right
now called The Lonely Room. Scott Glenn...

01:33:17.392 --> 01:33:19.810
...plays a detective like you.
- Is he a black woman?

01:33:20.020 --> 01:33:21.353
- No.
- Don't give me turkey.

01:33:21.521 --> 01:33:25.191
- Lily Tomlin's in that? I heard about that.
- Actually I was drawing a comparison...

01:33:25.400 --> 01:33:27.902
...not based on race or gender.

01:33:28.153 --> 01:33:32.823
Speaking of which,
did you go out with, uh, June, uh...?

01:33:33.700 --> 01:33:34.909
What is that woman's name?

01:33:36.203 --> 01:33:37.411
Gudmundsdottir.

01:33:37.996 --> 01:33:41.749
Ha. What is it? Who? Spell it for me.

01:33:41.917 --> 01:33:44.376
G-U-D-M-U-N-D-S-D-O-T-T-l-R.

01:33:44.586 --> 01:33:46.170
Well, that really helps.

01:33:46.338 --> 01:33:48.422
Could you...?
Uh, did you go out with June...?

01:33:48.590 --> 01:33:50.508
- Gudmundsdottir.
- Yeah. Her. Last night?

01:33:50.675 --> 01:33:51.967
Yes, I did.

01:33:52.135 --> 01:33:53.969
You guys known each other
a long time?

01:33:54.179 --> 01:33:57.181
No, I spoke to her for the first time
the night Kahane was killed.

01:33:57.349 --> 01:33:58.557
Wow.

01:33:58.725 --> 01:34:00.684
- So you didn't know her before this?
- No.

01:34:00.894 --> 01:34:02.520
We met over the phone.

01:34:02.687 --> 01:34:04.688
We got to talking,
one thing led to another.

01:34:04.898 --> 01:34:06.690
You fuck her?

01:34:07.692 --> 01:34:11.529
- What kind of question is that?
- I think it's pretty direct. Did you fuck her?

01:34:12.239 --> 01:34:15.157
I wouldn't answer that question
without a lawyer in the room.

01:34:15.325 --> 01:34:17.701
Then I probably wouldn't
even answer that question.

01:34:17.911 --> 01:34:20.329
Why don't you ask your friend?
He's been following me.

01:34:20.497 --> 01:34:22.623
- He'll probably know.
- All right.

01:34:22.874 --> 01:34:27.878
Paul, did Mr. Mill
fuck June Hudmuuhunta?

01:34:28.088 --> 01:34:29.338
I didn't see him.

01:34:29.506 --> 01:34:32.299
- Got away with it. He didn't see you.
- What are you implying?

01:34:32.467 --> 01:34:35.553
I'm not implying. I asked a direct question.
Did you fuck her?

01:34:35.762 --> 01:34:38.055
I told you I wouldn't answer that
without a lawyer.

01:34:38.223 --> 01:34:41.058
- Why you getting hot under the collar?
- You're being rude.

01:34:41.226 --> 01:34:42.393
Oh, well, excuse me.

01:34:42.602 --> 01:34:46.564
But I think it's kind of soon for her
to be gallivanting in the streets with you.

01:34:46.773 --> 01:34:49.024
I'm there for her as a friend, Miss Avery.

01:34:49.192 --> 01:34:51.360
- Mm.
- Why don't you call her?

01:34:51.570 --> 01:34:54.738
I'm sure she'll be happy to pick over
the horror of what's happened...

01:34:54.906 --> 01:34:58.367
...and tell you how we became friends.

01:34:58.577 --> 01:35:00.202
What is this, fucking Iran?

01:35:00.370 --> 01:35:03.998
Since when does the state tell us how long,
and with whom we can share our grief?

01:35:05.876 --> 01:35:08.002
Or do you hold June Gudmundsdottir...

01:35:08.170 --> 01:35:10.588
...to a special code of conduct
reserved for women?

01:35:17.888 --> 01:35:19.930
What the fuck are you laughing at?

01:35:20.098 --> 01:35:22.266
It's just, just...

01:35:22.434 --> 01:35:24.435
- I'd like to talk to my lawyer.
- Oh, my God.

01:35:24.603 --> 01:35:27.521
DeLONGPRE: "One of us. One of us."
- Can't even say the bitch's name!

01:35:27.689 --> 01:35:31.400
DeLONGPRE:
"One of us. One of us. One of us."

01:35:41.703 --> 01:35:44.121
It's time for you
to get yourself a real good lawyer.

01:35:44.331 --> 01:35:47.541
I had a drink with the guy, Walter.
That's all.

01:35:47.792 --> 01:35:52.922
If you went to Pasadena with the intent
to kill, you could go to the gas chamber.

01:35:53.632 --> 01:35:56.300
I went to Pasadena
with the intent to hire.

01:35:57.052 --> 01:35:58.177
So you say.

01:35:58.345 --> 01:36:01.138
- Griffin, the Schecter brothers are here.
- Griffin. Griffin.

01:36:01.306 --> 01:36:03.224
Griffin. Don't make us wait.

01:36:03.475 --> 01:36:04.642
Who is this man?

01:36:04.809 --> 01:36:06.644
A travel agent called. You're confirmed.

01:36:06.811 --> 01:36:08.145
He grabbed the phone from me.

01:36:08.355 --> 01:36:11.565
- Travel agent?
- I'm going to Puerto Vallarta.

01:36:12.150 --> 01:36:14.652
- You're leaving the country?
- For the weekend.

01:36:14.819 --> 01:36:15.986
It's a risk.

01:36:16.321 --> 01:36:17.571
Why?

01:36:17.822 --> 01:36:20.824
Because Larry Levy
could have my office in three days.

01:36:21.034 --> 01:36:24.495
- That's what Walter thinks.
- You know something I don't know?

01:36:26.831 --> 01:36:27.831
You're pretty smooth.

01:36:28.458 --> 01:36:30.668
I sleep at night.

01:36:31.753 --> 01:36:34.004
- You really should run the studio.
- Tell a friend.

01:36:34.214 --> 01:36:36.840
Yeah, Walter, it's been real.

01:36:37.008 --> 01:36:39.343
Griffin. We're tired of shopping
everything around.

01:36:39.511 --> 01:36:42.930
We wanna go exclusive to one studio.
How much have our three pictures made?

01:36:43.098 --> 01:36:45.224
- $105 million.
- I know some people do better.

01:36:45.392 --> 01:36:47.017
We're consistent and under budget.

01:36:47.185 --> 01:36:49.186
He's not listening. Let's go to Columbia.

01:36:49.354 --> 01:36:52.356
- We already went to Columbia.
- Oh, yeah. What did they say?

01:36:52.524 --> 01:36:53.607
- Bonnie.
- Hey, Bon.

01:36:53.775 --> 01:36:55.693
Hey. I got the Tom Wolfe book.

01:36:56.403 --> 01:36:58.028
Congratulations.

01:36:58.238 --> 01:37:00.864
Bonnie, make him give us a deal.
We want a home.

01:37:01.032 --> 01:37:03.033
We're tired of shopping everything around.

01:37:03.201 --> 01:37:05.494
I thought that's how
you guys like to do business.

01:37:05.704 --> 01:37:07.371
Well, we changed our minds.

01:37:08.623 --> 01:37:09.707
I'll talk to you later.

01:37:11.209 --> 01:37:13.377
Levison says you're
going out of town tomorrow.

01:37:14.045 --> 01:37:15.879
For the weekend.

01:37:16.548 --> 01:37:19.800
Are you going with someone
named June something?

01:37:20.552 --> 01:37:22.136
Yes.

01:37:22.595 --> 01:37:26.932
You took her to a party, Griffin,
with several hundred of my best friends.

01:37:27.142 --> 01:37:29.059
She's recently widowed.

01:37:29.227 --> 01:37:31.645
You weren't in town, so I took her.

01:37:32.897 --> 01:37:35.816
And now you're taking her
to Mexico for the weekend.

01:37:37.527 --> 01:37:39.653
Let's get out of here.
Mom and Dad are fighting.

01:37:39.821 --> 01:37:43.741
Guys, have your lawyer give me a call.

01:37:43.908 --> 01:37:45.909
- You've got a deal.
- Yes!

01:37:46.119 --> 01:37:47.995
Let's get out
before he changes his mind.

01:37:48.163 --> 01:37:49.830
We have witnesses.

01:38:02.844 --> 01:38:04.595
Have a good trip.

01:38:11.603 --> 01:38:14.188
The white zone is for immediate loading...

01:38:14.356 --> 01:38:16.982
...and unloading of passengers only.

01:38:17.192 --> 01:38:18.442
No parking.

01:38:18.651 --> 01:38:24.114
Do not leave your car unattended
due to the current security alert.

01:38:24.324 --> 01:38:28.786
All unattended cars may be towed away
immediately.

01:38:28.953 --> 01:38:30.329
For your safety...

01:38:30.497 --> 01:38:32.498
- Uh, did you bring your passport?
- Yeah.

01:38:32.665 --> 01:38:35.292
You wanna hear something funny?
I forgot mine.

01:38:35.460 --> 01:38:36.543
Oh.

01:38:36.711 --> 01:38:38.962
- We have to go back and get it.
- So stupid of me.

01:38:39.130 --> 01:38:41.673
- We'll miss the plane.
- We'll never make another plane.

01:38:41.841 --> 01:38:43.300
Damn it!

01:38:43.802 --> 01:38:46.136
It's all right.
Anyway, I got a better idea.

01:38:46.304 --> 01:38:48.847
- Do you like the desert?
- I've never been to the desert.

01:38:49.015 --> 01:38:51.141
Never been to the desert?
I know this hideaway...

01:38:51.309 --> 01:38:52.643
...in Desert Hot Springs.

01:38:52.811 --> 01:38:56.480
We'll go there. It's a two-hour drive.
I know the people. We'll call ahead.

01:38:56.648 --> 01:38:58.315
Are we hiding?

01:38:58.525 --> 01:39:01.860
Yeah. Yeah. We're hiding.
We're hiding from everybody.

01:39:03.822 --> 01:39:06.198
You'll like it there.
It'll remind you of Iceland.

01:39:38.857 --> 01:39:43.026
Evening, Mr. M. You're all checked in.
Capone Villa. You know where it is.

01:39:43.236 --> 01:39:45.654
- Yep. Thanks, Walter.
- You're welcome.

01:40:12.682 --> 01:40:15.392
Hey, look.
The water looks like it's steaming.

01:40:15.560 --> 01:40:17.936
Comes out of the ground that way.

01:40:39.918 --> 01:40:42.294
There aren't many people around.

01:40:42.921 --> 01:40:44.963
Well, they're fully booked, actually.

01:40:45.215 --> 01:40:47.257
There's 50 rooms, 100 people.

01:40:47.425 --> 01:40:49.343
Where are they all?

01:40:49.928 --> 01:40:51.637
Hiding.

01:40:51.888 --> 01:40:53.931
Ahem. Sir?

01:40:54.349 --> 01:40:56.475
Couple of Banning Springs water please.

01:40:56.726 --> 01:40:58.435
Right away, Mr. M.

01:41:01.105 --> 01:41:03.524
Do places like this really exist?

01:41:05.109 --> 01:41:06.735
Only in the movies.

01:41:37.475 --> 01:41:40.561
Tell me about the movies you make.

01:41:40.812 --> 01:41:42.479
Why?

01:41:42.981 --> 01:41:47.150
Because I want to know what you do.

01:41:48.152 --> 01:41:53.991
Well, I listen to stories and decide
if they'll make good movies or not.

01:41:54.325 --> 01:41:56.535
I get 125 phone calls a day.

01:41:56.786 --> 01:42:00.372
And if I let that slip to 100...

01:42:00.582 --> 01:42:03.917
...I know I'm not doing my job.

01:42:04.085 --> 01:42:05.502
Oh.

01:42:06.296 --> 01:42:09.590
Everyone that calls,
they wanna know one thing.

01:42:10.383 --> 01:42:13.677
They want me to say yes to them
and make their movie.

01:42:13.928 --> 01:42:16.930
If I say "Yes, I'll make the movie,"
they think come New Years...

01:42:17.098 --> 01:42:21.602
...it's just gonna be them and
Jack Nicholson on the slopes of Aspen.

01:42:22.353 --> 01:42:24.313
That's what they think.

01:42:26.941 --> 01:42:28.692
Problem is...

01:42:28.860 --> 01:42:33.530
...I can only say yes... My studio
can only say yes 12 times a year.

01:42:33.698 --> 01:42:38.368
And collectively,
we hear about 50,000 stories a year.

01:42:38.578 --> 01:42:40.537
So it's hard.

01:42:42.874 --> 01:42:45.751
And I guess sometimes I'm not nice...

01:42:47.253 --> 01:42:49.254
...and make enemies.

01:42:50.715 --> 01:42:53.216
And that's what I was to David.

01:42:54.052 --> 01:42:55.636
Enemy.

01:42:56.387 --> 01:42:58.972
Was his story one of the 12?

01:42:59.223 --> 01:43:01.058
No, it wasn't.

01:43:01.726 --> 01:43:02.934
Why?

01:43:03.144 --> 01:43:07.856
It lacks certain elements that we need
to market a film successfully.

01:43:08.399 --> 01:43:10.442
What elements?

01:43:12.570 --> 01:43:17.574
Suspense, laughter, violence.

01:43:19.369 --> 01:43:21.745
Hope, heart.

01:43:24.082 --> 01:43:26.500
Nudity, sex.

01:43:28.086 --> 01:43:29.586
Happy endings.

01:43:31.172 --> 01:43:33.799
Mainly happy endings.

01:43:37.095 --> 01:43:38.929
What about reality?

01:43:40.640 --> 01:43:42.516
You're not from Iceland, are you?

01:43:44.477 --> 01:43:46.436
Did I say that?

01:43:47.563 --> 01:43:48.855
Hmm.

01:43:49.774 --> 01:43:53.777
Why don't you put me in the hot springs
and see if I melt?

01:44:42.034 --> 01:44:43.577
I love you.

01:44:43.828 --> 01:44:47.748
I know. I know.

01:44:55.173 --> 01:44:57.257
I know.

01:44:57.884 --> 01:44:59.843
There's something you have to know.

01:45:00.011 --> 01:45:02.888
- I love you. I know I love you.
- Something I have to tell you.

01:45:03.055 --> 01:45:04.973
That's all I need.

01:45:05.183 --> 01:45:06.725
Nothing can change that.

01:45:06.976 --> 01:45:08.393
June.

01:45:08.603 --> 01:45:10.353
- David's death.
- No. Shh.

01:45:10.521 --> 01:45:12.397
It's in the past.

01:45:12.607 --> 01:45:15.609
Don't. Don't. It's another life.

01:45:15.860 --> 01:45:18.862
I have to tell you something.
Something you have to know.

01:45:19.071 --> 01:45:22.991
Don't, don't, don't say anymore. Don't.

01:45:23.367 --> 01:45:25.410
- I was responsible.
- I love you. Don't.

01:45:25.620 --> 01:45:28.705
- It was my fault.
- Don't say that.

01:45:28.915 --> 01:45:32.876
Don't, don't, don't. I love you.

01:46:51.289 --> 01:46:52.497
Mr. M?

01:46:52.874 --> 01:46:54.749
Mr. M, sorry to disturb you.

01:46:54.917 --> 01:46:57.168
There's a telephone call
and it sounds important.

01:46:57.336 --> 01:46:59.212
- Who is it?
- A Mr. Dick Mellen.

01:46:59.380 --> 01:47:01.339
He says he's your lawyer.

01:47:23.154 --> 01:47:24.738
Dick, how'd you fine me?

01:47:24.947 --> 01:47:28.158
Come on, Griff.
Who the hell do you think you're talking to?

01:47:28.326 --> 01:47:29.993
Yeah. What's going on?

01:47:30.202 --> 01:47:33.496
- Levison's out.
- Out?

01:47:33.664 --> 01:47:35.874
They gave him six hours
to clean out his office.

01:47:36.083 --> 01:47:38.168
- Who's taking over?
- Nothing's been decided.

01:47:38.336 --> 01:47:41.671
All we know is Reggie Goldman
went home with the clap or something.

01:47:42.590 --> 01:47:46.301
- Listen, am I in a position to...?
- I don't wanna talk about studio politics.

01:47:46.469 --> 01:47:48.720
Why didn't you tell me about this
Kahane business?

01:47:50.181 --> 01:47:51.723
Kahane.

01:47:51.933 --> 01:47:53.391
I tried to, Dick, but...

01:47:53.601 --> 01:47:55.226
You didn't try hard enough.

01:47:55.394 --> 01:47:58.396
You better be at the Pasadena
Police Station in about four hours.

01:47:59.815 --> 01:48:02.192
Pasadena? What for?

01:48:02.401 --> 01:48:05.320
A fucking lineup, that's what for.

01:48:05.488 --> 01:48:06.863
They got a witness, evidently.

01:48:07.073 --> 01:48:09.699
Now, look, I found you a guy,
his name is Gar Girard.

01:48:09.867 --> 01:48:12.535
He's a top-flight criminal lawyer.
He's tough, hard-nosed.

01:48:12.703 --> 01:48:15.455
Don't you talk to anybody else.
Just get there.

01:48:16.207 --> 01:48:19.876
- I'll be there.
- Griffin, this is a tough one.

01:48:20.086 --> 01:48:21.419
Good luck.

01:48:22.964 --> 01:48:24.589
Thanks.

01:48:32.974 --> 01:48:37.394
Mr. Mill, the studio's very upset
about the publicity this might generate.

01:48:37.561 --> 01:48:40.438
But I'll handle the press, the police,
the judge and the witness.

01:48:40.606 --> 01:48:43.066
Mr. Mill. Thank you for coming down
without a fight.

01:48:43.234 --> 01:48:45.819
It's in your best interest.
You sleep in that suit?

01:48:45.987 --> 01:48:47.946
Get away from that woman.
She's the enemy.

01:48:48.114 --> 01:48:50.490
- Follow me.
- Susan, I had a lovely time at the Mint.

01:48:50.658 --> 01:48:52.242
I can't believe you remembered it.

01:48:52.451 --> 01:48:54.786
Mr. Mill, Gar Girard.
I'm here to represent you.

01:48:54.996 --> 01:48:57.622
Dick Mellen called me in on this.
Here's the situation.

01:48:57.832 --> 01:49:00.250
They've got a witness.
They want you to do a lineup.

01:49:00.418 --> 01:49:02.544
If you say no, they'll arrest you.

01:49:02.753 --> 01:49:05.588
And even if you get identified,
I'll get you off on bail.

01:49:05.798 --> 01:49:09.592
Now, this witness lives across the street
from the parking lot.

01:49:09.760 --> 01:49:12.679
Even if she makes an identification,
a positive ID right now...

01:49:12.888 --> 01:49:16.975
...even if that happens, it was very late
at night. By the time I'm finished with her...

01:49:17.143 --> 01:49:20.603
...the world will have a new legal
standard for blindness. Keep the faith...

01:49:20.813 --> 01:49:23.314
This is just like they do it on television.

01:49:23.524 --> 01:49:25.608
Excuse me, Susan. Good luck.

01:49:25.818 --> 01:49:29.029
You don't have to worry.
You can see them but they can't see you.

01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:31.197
- Fine. Fine.
- Just tell the truth.

01:49:31.407 --> 01:49:35.869
Oh, I will. Because
I saw him clearly. There's no problem.

01:49:37.413 --> 01:49:39.372
All right, Allen. Fire it up.

01:49:39.582 --> 01:49:41.791
Number 1, step forward.

01:49:42.084 --> 01:49:44.794
Make a quarter turn to the right.

01:49:45.504 --> 01:49:48.006
- Are those prescription glasses?
- You can't ask her that.

01:49:48.174 --> 01:49:49.883
- Fine.
- It's very hard, you know.

01:49:50.092 --> 01:49:52.927
- Oh, yeah. I know.
- Number 2, take one step forward.

01:49:53.137 --> 01:49:56.306
- I wouldn't wanna pick the wrong one.
- No. God forbid.

01:49:56.849 --> 01:49:58.141
You just take your time.

01:49:58.309 --> 01:50:01.352
Oh, I know.
Anybody look, uh, vaguely familiar?

01:50:01.562 --> 01:50:03.146
Take a quarter turn to the left.

01:50:05.066 --> 01:50:06.816
- Face forward.
- Take your time.

01:50:06.984 --> 01:50:09.235
Step back into position.
Number 3, take one step.

01:50:09.403 --> 01:50:10.987
- This is not easy.
- I know.

01:50:11.155 --> 01:50:13.406
- It never is.
- I mean, I am trying.

01:50:13.616 --> 01:50:15.366
Yes. Just take your time.

01:50:15.534 --> 01:50:17.869
- And I did see him clearly.
- Face forward.

01:50:18.037 --> 01:50:19.329
Make a quarter turn to the left.

01:50:22.875 --> 01:50:25.168
- Step back as...
- No, no, no. I don't know.

01:50:25.419 --> 01:50:26.711
- Well.
- Look hard.

01:50:26.921 --> 01:50:31.382
- Look really... Take a good look.
- No. I did, I did, I am. Um...

01:50:31.592 --> 01:50:33.802
Could I see, um...

01:50:34.762 --> 01:50:36.721
...Number 3 again?
- Call Number 3.

01:50:36.931 --> 01:50:38.973
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.
- Um, could I...?

01:50:39.183 --> 01:50:41.476
- Could she call her own numbers?
- Excuse me.

01:50:41.685 --> 01:50:45.313
- Maybe she wants to see again.
- Number 5, take one step forward.

01:50:45.481 --> 01:50:46.815
- Listen...
- Excuse me.

01:50:46.982 --> 01:50:48.066
Number 5.

01:50:48.275 --> 01:50:50.860
Susan, I think she can call
who she's interested in.

01:50:51.028 --> 01:50:54.781
- You're absolutely right.
- No, the other one. That one.

01:50:54.949 --> 01:50:56.533
- By the number.
- Which one?

01:50:56.700 --> 01:51:00.286
- Oh, um, uh, it's not Number 6.
- Not Number 6.

01:51:00.454 --> 01:51:02.080
- How about Number 5?
- Three.

01:51:02.289 --> 01:51:04.207
- Three.
- What do you mean, Number 3?

01:51:04.375 --> 01:51:06.709
- She can request who she wants.
- Just a second.

01:51:06.877 --> 01:51:08.419
You wanna see what number?

01:51:08.587 --> 01:51:12.632
Him! That's him.
I'd swear on my mother's grave.

01:51:12.842 --> 01:51:15.218
Number 3.
I think we're concluded, Ms. Avery.

01:51:15.386 --> 01:51:17.887
- The one, Number 3.
- Number 3. On her mother's grave.

01:51:18.055 --> 01:51:19.556
- Yes.
- Number 3?

01:51:20.057 --> 01:51:21.975
Number 3.
I think we heard what she said.

01:51:22.184 --> 01:51:24.727
- Yeah, I would say so.
- Okay, Doug, take them out.

01:51:24.895 --> 01:51:27.814
- Number 3, thank you.
- Just relax. You're in a chair.

01:51:28.482 --> 01:51:30.525
- Ma'am, may I be personal?
- Yes.

01:51:30.693 --> 01:51:32.443
Where the fuck is your mother buried?

01:51:33.821 --> 01:51:36.239
- Let's get out of here.
- Let's get out of this sauna.

01:51:41.245 --> 01:51:44.831
I don't know who got to that witness,
but she sure wrapped up my case.

01:51:45.040 --> 01:51:47.917
- You're a lucky man, Mr. Mill.
- Goddamn it, no ramp again.

01:51:48.127 --> 01:51:49.502
Witnesses can't be relied on.

01:51:49.712 --> 01:51:53.047
Remember Witness for the Prosecution,
Marlene Dietrich and Tyrone Power?

01:51:53.257 --> 01:51:55.842
That's it. You're free as a bird.
No witness, no crime.

01:51:56.051 --> 01:51:58.553
That Avery woman thinks
you just got away with murder.

01:51:58.721 --> 01:52:01.014
Everybody does, Mr. Mill.

01:52:48.437 --> 01:52:53.191
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed by thy name.

01:52:53.400 --> 01:52:58.238
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

01:52:58.697 --> 01:53:01.950
Give us this day our daily bread...

01:53:02.159 --> 01:53:05.078
...and forgive us our trespasses...

01:54:43.635 --> 01:54:47.638
You've made a wonderful movie.
It's perfect.

01:54:47.848 --> 01:54:50.641
It's Oscar time, Larry.

01:54:55.731 --> 01:54:58.691
- What?
- We're too late. Come on.

01:54:58.901 --> 01:55:01.194
I gotta get the door open.

01:55:02.571 --> 01:55:04.072
Come on.

01:55:07.326 --> 01:55:09.619
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Get back!

01:55:27.846 --> 01:55:31.057
Oh. What took you so long?

01:55:31.266 --> 01:55:32.725
Traffic was a bitch.

01:55:43.320 --> 01:55:44.654
It's outstanding.

01:55:44.863 --> 01:55:48.282
- The audience is gonna love it.
- You sold it out.

01:55:48.450 --> 01:55:51.994
How could you let him sell you out?
What about truth? What about reality?

01:55:52.162 --> 01:55:54.914
What about the way
the old ending tested in Canoga Park?

01:55:55.124 --> 01:55:56.457
Everybody hated it.

01:55:56.667 --> 01:55:59.669
We reshot it. Now everybody loves it.
That's reality.

01:55:59.837 --> 01:56:02.630
You had an ending which was true.
You didn't give it a chance.

01:56:02.798 --> 01:56:06.217
Who is this person? Does she know
anything about working with grown-ups?

01:56:06.427 --> 01:56:08.594
Bonnie, goddamn it, goddamn it.

01:56:08.804 --> 01:56:11.764
This is a hit.
This is what we're here for.

01:56:11.974 --> 01:56:14.016
Yeah, well, it didn't have
to end this way.

01:56:14.226 --> 01:56:17.520
- I want you out of here.
- Good thinking, Larry.

01:56:17.729 --> 01:56:19.730
I'm going over your head, Larry.

01:56:19.940 --> 01:56:22.233
Bonnie, you're fired.

01:56:23.944 --> 01:56:25.278
Fuck you.

01:56:25.487 --> 01:56:28.281
It takes more to make it
in this business than a dirty mouth.

01:56:28.449 --> 01:56:30.324
The campaign.

01:56:52.431 --> 01:56:53.764
Two points.

01:56:59.062 --> 01:57:01.314
Celia, it's important.
I need to talk to him now.

01:57:01.523 --> 01:57:03.274
- No, Bonnie, he's very busy.
- Please.

01:57:03.442 --> 01:57:05.443
- No, you... Bonnie.
- Please, it's me, Bonnie.

01:57:05.652 --> 01:57:07.862
- We're friends.
- Bonnie, you don't understand.

01:57:08.071 --> 01:57:12.742
- I am not just me, I'm also the job.
- Please. Please. Please.

01:57:12.951 --> 01:57:17.955
Oh, honey. All right, all right.
I'll try, okay?

01:57:20.417 --> 01:57:22.335
Three points.

01:57:22.711 --> 01:57:26.297
- Great shot.
- Oh, Walter, stop that nonsense.

01:57:26.507 --> 01:57:29.258
Griffin, it's Bonnie.

01:57:29.468 --> 01:57:31.302
She's here.

01:57:33.222 --> 01:57:35.223
Great shot.

01:57:35.933 --> 01:57:37.058
Levy fired her?

01:57:37.267 --> 01:57:39.685
Yes, sir. I guess he did.

01:57:41.188 --> 01:57:43.272
Well, I can't see her now.

01:57:43.732 --> 01:57:46.025
I promised I'd be home early.

01:57:47.319 --> 01:57:48.736
Tell her I'll get back to her.

01:57:48.946 --> 01:57:51.489
Walter, get your foot
off the fucking couch.

01:57:51.698 --> 01:57:52.782
Tell her yourself.

01:57:52.950 --> 01:57:55.952
- Yes. Okay, well, could you hold, please?
- Griffin. Griffin.

01:57:56.119 --> 01:57:57.203
I have to talk to you.

01:57:57.412 --> 01:57:58.746
- Please!
- It's very important.

01:57:58.914 --> 01:58:02.833
- Griffin, please. Can we talk about it?
- Bonnie, you'll land on your feet. I know it.

01:58:03.001 --> 01:58:05.878
- You're a survivor.
- It's Larry Levy's office. It's important.

01:58:06.088 --> 01:58:08.089
Oh, put it in the front seat.

01:58:08.423 --> 01:58:10.967
Give it a minute and
transfer it to the car phone.

01:58:23.438 --> 01:58:26.482
- Yeah?
- Griffin, I have Larry Levy on the line.

01:58:26.650 --> 01:58:29.026
Larry, how'd the screening go?
How's my new ending?

01:58:29.194 --> 01:58:31.737
Fantastic. Fantastic.
Worked like gangbusters.

01:58:31.947 --> 01:58:35.908
- That's why you get the big bucks, Griff.
- Yeah, yeah. Stop kissing my ass, Larry.

01:58:36.118 --> 01:58:38.995
- What? Can't this wait?
- I don't think it should. This is hot.

01:58:39.162 --> 01:58:41.497
I got a writer who's got a pitch
you ought to hear.

01:58:41.665 --> 01:58:44.000
It's something we should go for.
It's a great idea.

01:58:44.167 --> 01:58:47.670
- Yeah? Who's the writer?
- I'll put him on the speaker. Hold on.

01:58:47.838 --> 01:58:49.463
Hi, Griff. Remember me?

01:58:49.631 --> 01:58:52.967
I'm the asshole who used to be
in the postcard business.

01:58:53.176 --> 01:58:54.802
- You?
- Yeah, that's right.

01:58:55.012 --> 01:58:57.471
The king of suspense himself.
You remember me?

01:58:57.681 --> 01:58:59.515
I haven't heard from you in a while.

01:58:59.725 --> 01:59:02.184
Well, I've been busy.
I've been writing a script.

01:59:02.352 --> 01:59:04.061
- I got inspired.
- Give him the pitch.

01:59:04.271 --> 01:59:06.230
You'll love this, Griffin. It's great.

01:59:06.440 --> 01:59:09.191
All right, it's a Hollywood story,
Griff. A real thriller.

01:59:09.401 --> 01:59:12.695
It's about a shit-bag producer
studio exec...

01:59:12.863 --> 01:59:16.240
...who murders a writer
he thinks is harassing him.

01:59:16.450 --> 01:59:19.368
Problem is, he kills the wrong writer.

01:59:19.578 --> 01:59:22.872
Now he's got to deal with blackmail
as well as the cops.

01:59:23.081 --> 01:59:27.001
But here's the switch.
The son of a bitch, he gets away with it.

01:59:27.169 --> 01:59:29.545
Larry, get off the speaker.
I wanna talk privately.

01:59:29.713 --> 01:59:32.506
Sure thing. This is a winner, Griffin.
It's a winner.

01:59:32.716 --> 01:59:34.675
- He gets away with it?
- Absolutely.

01:59:34.843 --> 01:59:38.220
It's a Hollywood ending, Griff.
He marries the dead writer's girl...

01:59:38.388 --> 01:59:42.099
...and they live happily ever after.
- Can you guarantee that ending?

01:59:42.267 --> 01:59:45.728
- If the price is right, you got it.
- If you can guarantee me that ending...

01:59:45.896 --> 01:59:48.272
...you got a deal.
- I guarantee it, Griff.

01:59:48.482 --> 01:59:51.776
- What do you call this thing anyway?
- The Player.

01:59:51.985 --> 01:59:53.611
The Player.

01:59:56.865 --> 01:59:57.907
I like that.

02:00:01.286 --> 02:00:03.329
What took you so long?

02:00:03.538 --> 02:00:05.998
Traffic was a bitch.
