WEBVTT

00:02.961 --> 00:06.795
J‘ This is the way we play,
this is the way we love J‘

00:06.840 --> 00:08.250
J‘ This is the way J‘

00:08.300 --> 00:12.509
(groans)
Excuse me. Excuse me.

00:14.139 --> 00:15.754
Officers.

00:15.807 --> 00:18.298
Sorry. (clears throat)
Beautiful evening.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.092
Is it? Move.

00:20.145 --> 00:22.352
— Wow.
— What?

00:22.397 --> 00:24.308
— Nothing.
— Good.

00:24.358 --> 00:26.974
J‘ This is the way he works,
this is the way she plays J‘

00:27.027 --> 00:28.312
J‘ This is the way J‘

00:28.362 --> 00:30.478
Ahem.

00:30.531 --> 00:31.987
(cashier, quietly)
See that man over...

00:32.032 --> 00:33.363
Aisle five.

00:33.408 --> 00:34.944
You go long.
l'll cut him off.

00:34.993 --> 00:36.449
Right.

00:38.330 --> 00:40.321
(man and woman)
J‘ He helps you dive real tight J‘

00:41.875 --> 00:44.161
J‘ He helps you get rearranged J‘

00:44.920 --> 00:45.830
Sir, you have a minute?

00:48.507 --> 00:49.838
| just want to talk to you.

00:49.883 --> 00:51.794
Sorry, I can't.
I'm in a bit of a rush.

00:51.843 --> 00:55.882
5'8", athletic build, dark clothes,

00:55.931 --> 00:57.637
and a pretty funky skin condition.

00:57.683 --> 00:59.890
I'm guessing you got
a dye pack in the face,

00:59.935 --> 01:03.473
one of the many hazards
of robbing a bank. McNally?

01:03.522 --> 01:06.059
Definitely matches
the description we gave.

01:06.108 --> 01:07.939
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:10.529 --> 01:11.939
Watch it, watch it, watch——

01:13.365 --> 01:15.071
You head across!
We'll box him in!

01:15.117 --> 01:16.197
Watch that corner!

01:18.245 --> 01:20.907
(McNally) Stop! Don't move!

01:20.956 --> 01:24.574
Get your hands where I can
see 'em, now! Get 'em up!

01:24.626 --> 01:26.082
— He's swallowing!
— Hey, hey!

01:26.128 --> 01:27.538
What did you swallow?

01:27.588 --> 01:28.998
My pride.

01:29.047 --> 01:32.756
Oh, yeah. That's really hilarious.
I am not in the mood.

01:34.386 --> 01:37.002
No, really.
'Cause you're having a bad day?

01:37.431 --> 01:38.716
I'm the one who's blue.

01:40.851 --> 01:42.057
(handcuffs click)

01:42.102 --> 01:43.808
(woman) J‘ Overtime J‘

01:45.272 --> 01:46.637
J‘ Overtime J‘

01:46.690 --> 01:48.931
(police radio chatter)

01:48.984 --> 01:50.224
J‘ Overtime J‘

01:50.277 --> 01:52.268
(thunder rumbles)

01:52.321 --> 01:54.653
Uh, no, ma'am, we can't
send another officer over.

01:54.698 --> 01:56.689
Yeah, because we just sent one
out an hour ago,

01:56.742 --> 01:58.949
and he didn't hear a single thing
coming from your neighbor's party, so——

01:58.994 --> 02:00.655
(dial tone)

02:02.372 --> 02:04.033
Which is exactly
where I'm going after work,

02:04.082 --> 02:05.868
to crank music and annoy you,
you bee—yotch.

02:05.917 --> 02:08.875
Wow, them's fighting words,
if you're 9.

02:08.920 --> 02:11.536
ljust called an old lady
a bee—yotch.

02:11.590 --> 02:12.579
Hey, you not loving desk duty?

02:12.633 --> 02:14.589
— I love everything about this job.
— Good.

02:14.635 --> 02:17.547
But seriously?
Desk duty three shifts in a row?

02:17.596 --> 02:18.881
— Hey, Shaw.
— Yeah.

02:18.930 --> 02:20.841
— Blue guy in booking.
— Ooh. Blue guy?

02:20.891 --> 02:23.507
Settle down, Diaz.
Shift's almost over.

02:23.560 --> 02:25.266
You know what?

02:25.312 --> 02:27.769
My wife is sliding by in a bit
to pick me up.

02:27.814 --> 02:30.271
Flirt with her. Okay?
lt'll make her day.

02:32.194 --> 02:35.106
Thanks. It's Zoe,
but you call her Mrs. Shaw.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.486
(under breath)
Zoe, Mrs. Shaw. Okay.

02:36.531 --> 02:38.067
(telephone rings)

02:38.116 --> 02:39.902
Yeah. 15 Division.

02:41.078 --> 02:44.161
(Gail) Can you stop the car?
Can you stop the car, please?

02:48.669 --> 02:50.660
Do l have barf on me?

02:50.712 --> 02:53.124
You might want
to wash your hair.

02:54.466 --> 02:56.502
I really thought
drunk guys puking on me

02:56.551 --> 02:58.542
would be over after high school.
Mr. Lee!

02:58.595 --> 03:01.712
Easy,easy.
He's having a rough night.

03:01.765 --> 03:04.256
Oh, he's having a rough night.
We've got the smell of booze and barf

03:04.309 --> 03:06.550
in the back of our squad car.
Frank's gonna kill us.

03:06.603 --> 03:08.389
Just as long as he doesn't
make us stay late to clean it up,

03:08.438 --> 03:10.554
'cause I got Leo in the morning,
and I'm taking him for dim sum.

03:10.607 --> 03:11.972
Don't talk about food right now.

03:12.025 --> 03:15.062
Gail, when you are a mother——
and God help that child——

03:15.112 --> 03:17.899
you are gonna realize a little puke
is not such a big deal.

03:17.948 --> 03:20.735
All right. Let's go.
Wakey, wakey.

03:20.784 --> 03:22.900
One foot in front of the other.
Let's go.

03:22.953 --> 03:25.786
You... there we go, here we go.

03:25.831 --> 03:27.617
You're gonna have
a nice, long nap...

03:27.666 --> 03:29.782
Aren't you just the mother
of the frickin' year?

03:32.838 --> 03:34.453
That's it, then?
Nothing else in your pockets?

03:34.506 --> 03:37.998
— That's all I got.
— 80, watch, belt, 40 bucks.

03:38.051 --> 03:41.339
And 40 cents.
And what's left of my dignity.

03:41.388 --> 03:43.128
You robbed a bank
and pistol—whipped a manager.

03:43.181 --> 03:44.921
We don't care about
your dignity, blue guy.

03:44.975 --> 03:47.387
Or your freedom...Braveheart.

03:47.436 --> 03:49.597
(Traci) Excuse us.
Excuse us, clear the way.

03:49.646 --> 03:52.103
Oh! That's disgusting!

03:52.149 --> 03:54.140
(Gail) Oh, you don't like
the smell of barf?

03:54.192 --> 03:55.773
We picked this guy up
on Yonge Street.

03:55.819 --> 03:58.060
He was kicking cars
and screaming at pedestrians.

03:58.113 --> 04:00.195
Yeah, well, he shouldn't be here.
Should be at the hospital.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.231
We didn't know how messed up he was
until we got him in the car.

04:02.284 --> 04:03.490
(coughing)

04:03.535 --> 04:05.446
— Whoa. Whoa!
— Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

04:05.495 --> 04:08.578
— Get his head. Get him on his side.
— He's on his side, sir.

04:08.623 --> 04:10.579
Good. Call an ambulance, Peck.

04:12.836 --> 04:14.042
(groaning)

04:14.087 --> 04:15.873
(siren wailing in distance)

04:15.922 --> 04:17.458
Dos cervezas.

04:19.718 --> 04:21.549
Epstein. You off duty?

04:21.595 --> 04:24.587
— Uh, swapped out my shift.
— What, you got a big date?

04:24.639 --> 04:28.006
Hey, you got a big date.
Nice. She's cute.

04:28.059 --> 04:30.641
She's, uh, ETF.
A bomb tech.

04:30.687 --> 04:32.643
We met while she was
talking me off a bomb.

04:32.689 --> 04:35.726
Well, hey, good strategy,
dating someone outside the division.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.016
That way, when it all goes to hell,

04:37.068 --> 04:39.059
you won't have to
see her face every day.

04:39.112 --> 04:41.649
Right. Good talk.

04:47.329 --> 04:49.866
So... what do you want
to do tonight?

04:49.915 --> 04:50.825
I don't know.

04:50.874 --> 04:52.990
Well, it's a lot of pressure.
lhearyou.

04:53.043 --> 04:54.533
Well, there's a lot
of people at work,

04:54.586 --> 04:56.827
uh, waiting to hear
how this hookup goes, so...

04:56.880 --> 04:58.620
— Really?
— Mm—hmm.

04:58.673 --> 05:02.211
Well, uh, I was just thinking
that we could hang out here

05:02.260 --> 05:04.091
until we go somewhere else,
and then,

05:04.137 --> 05:07.629
when we go somewhere else,
we could do... whatever?

05:07.682 --> 05:09.934
(chuckles) Works for me.

05:13.522 --> 05:15.433
(police radio chatter)

05:20.362 --> 05:21.852
Hey, watch his head.

05:21.905 --> 05:24.738
Yeah, thank you.
I know what I'm doing, Charlotte.

05:24.783 --> 05:27.240
Yeah? Until you smash his skull
into the seat back again.

05:27.285 --> 05:28.991
Oh, that's nice, really.

05:29.037 --> 05:30.652
Which one of you
want to go along for a ride?

05:30.705 --> 05:31.865
To the hospital?

05:31.915 --> 05:33.871
To the observation deck
of the CN Tower.

05:33.917 --> 05:37.250
Yes, the hospital. You arrested him
for public intoxication.

05:37.295 --> 05:38.580
Just because he's under the weather,

05:38.630 --> 05:40.120
doesn't make his charge go away.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.879
All right, I got to get up early
in the morning.

05:41.925 --> 05:43.335
l have upchuck in my hair.

05:43.385 --> 05:45.000
You can wash it out at the hospital.

05:45.053 --> 05:46.918
— Evaluations are next month.
— I'll do it.

05:48.932 --> 05:50.672
Hi. Traci.

05:50.725 --> 05:52.886
Martin.
That's my wife, Charlotte.

05:53.979 --> 05:55.594
Yeah, she's in the mood.

05:57.816 --> 06:01.024
Peck, you smell.
You smell real bad.

06:04.155 --> 06:07.522
Our system doesn't have
any record of your fingerprints,

06:07.576 --> 06:11.444
and you got no lD,
so, uh... let's start with your name.

06:11.496 --> 06:13.032
Oh.

06:13.081 --> 06:15.163
Grouchy Smurf.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.119
I'm sure you're aware that yesterday,

06:17.168 --> 06:21.457
two men wearing ski masks
robbed Broadway Mutual Bank

06:21.506 --> 06:23.792
at King and Church with a pistol,

06:23.842 --> 06:27.630
which, in turn,
they used to beat Sunil Dhawan,

06:27.679 --> 06:30.295
branch manager, father of three.

06:30.348 --> 06:33.181
— Recognize him?
— No.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.888
You beat him so bad,
he's still in the hospital.

06:38.356 --> 06:39.186
Where's the money?

06:40.150 --> 06:41.014
What money?

06:41.067 --> 06:42.318
The money you stole from the bank.

06:42.360 --> 06:43.975
— What bank?
— Really?

06:45.780 --> 06:47.236
Come on. What did you swallow
when we caught you?

06:47.282 --> 06:49.068
Have no idea
what you're talking about.

06:49.117 --> 06:50.482
All right.

06:52.537 --> 06:54.073
Here's an easy one.

06:55.206 --> 06:56.195
Why are you blue?

06:56.249 --> 06:58.740
I picked up a bad skin condition,

06:58.793 --> 07:02.001
or I like blueberries...a lot.

07:02.047 --> 07:06.211
Or a security dye pack
blew up in your face

07:06.259 --> 07:08.170
45 seconds after you left the bank.

07:08.219 --> 07:11.757
(chuckles) Well, that's a bit far—fetched,
don't you think?

07:11.806 --> 07:13.888
Yeah. You know,

07:13.934 --> 07:17.802
if you think denying everything
is gonna get you released, it's not.

07:17.854 --> 07:19.139
Here's how it works.

07:19.189 --> 07:21.430
Tomorrow you go to court,
then you go to jail.

07:22.901 --> 07:24.687
In the meantime...

07:25.987 --> 07:28.444
we can sit.

07:28.490 --> 07:32.233
We can look at Sunil's photo.

07:32.285 --> 07:34.071
Oh, and you.

07:35.538 --> 07:38.120
We can look at big, blue you.

07:41.753 --> 07:43.459
What do we do?

07:43.505 --> 07:46.042
Uh, we wait till Jerry gets bored,
runs out of steam,

07:46.091 --> 07:48.252
then we throw blue guy back
in his cell, and, uh,

07:48.301 --> 07:49.757
start again tomorrow.

07:51.930 --> 07:54.137
Here, you want some?

07:54.182 --> 07:55.922
Jo's hand cream.

07:55.976 --> 07:58.262
— It's not Jo's.
— Oh. Smells like Jo's.

07:58.311 --> 08:00.222
Fine, it's Jo's.

08:01.231 --> 08:02.562
It's really good hand cream.

08:02.607 --> 08:04.347
She left it behind...

08:05.694 --> 08:07.980
with three pens, hairbrush,
and a burned CD.

08:08.029 --> 08:09.815
— You need to move on.
— l have moved on.

08:09.864 --> 08:11.855
You're snooping around in her desk.
You really want to move on?

08:11.908 --> 08:13.944
Get an ax, smash it to pieces.

08:13.994 --> 08:16.406
No, 'cause I'm not angry anymore.
I was angry last week.

08:16.454 --> 08:18.365
Okay? I'm at bargaining now.

08:18.415 --> 08:20.121
Which is why I thought
that if I cleaned out her desk,

08:20.166 --> 08:22.248
then I would feel a lot better.

08:22.293 --> 08:24.420
— Well, do you?
— No. No, I don't...

08:24.462 --> 08:26.953
which makes me feel like I've maybe
moved on to depression,

08:27.007 --> 08:28.963
with acceptance
right around the corner.

08:29.592 --> 08:30.923
You need an ax.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.218
(cell phone rings)

08:33.263 --> 08:35.424
I gotta get this. It's Traci.

08:37.851 --> 08:39.011
Hey, Trace. What's up?

08:39.060 --> 08:41.927
Hypothetically speaking,
if you were trying to prevent

08:41.980 --> 08:44.392
two newly married people
from murdering each other,

08:44.441 --> 08:46.727
would you use your baton,
or go straight for your gun?

08:46.776 --> 08:49.518
...followed my instructions, guy'd be in Triage
by now, instead of Emergency.

08:49.571 --> 08:50.811
(Andy) Mood I'm in, I'd use both.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.274
I thought you weren't angry anymore.

08:52.323 --> 08:55.656
Of course I'm angry,
but I'm working on it.

08:55.702 --> 08:58.034
You know, I used to actually
love coming to work.

08:58.079 --> 09:00.070
You know?
I used to feel safe here.

09:00.123 --> 09:01.203
(Martin) Just because we're married,

09:01.249 --> 09:03.956
doesn't give you free license
to be mean.

09:04.002 --> 09:06.459
I'm sorry you got turned down
for med school again.

09:06.504 --> 09:07.334
Where are you?

09:07.380 --> 09:10.463
Uhh! I'm in hell. They stuck me
in a room with the Bickersons,

09:10.508 --> 09:11.884
told us all to wait.

09:11.926 --> 09:14.212
— You're still at the hospital?
— We brought the guy in.

09:14.262 --> 09:15.547
They took him off to Emergency,

09:15.597 --> 09:17.053
and now they won't let us
go anywhere.

09:17.098 --> 09:20.056
— What was it again, Martin?
— Of course, you're blaming me.

09:20.101 --> 09:21.216
What the hell is going on?

09:22.395 --> 09:23.384
Hey.

09:23.980 --> 09:24.844
Hey.

09:24.898 --> 09:27.230
— (Martin) No, no, no, no, no.
— (Charlotte) What?

09:27.275 --> 09:28.856
Hey!

09:28.902 --> 09:30.858
— Traci?
— What's going on?

09:33.239 --> 09:34.945
Sir, | just got off the phone
with Traci.

09:34.991 --> 09:36.606
She seems a little stressed out.

09:38.620 --> 09:40.110
Hey, uh, what's happening?

09:40.163 --> 09:42.074
Nobody leaves.
Nobody comes in until further notice.

09:42.123 --> 09:43.829
(Chris and Andy) Why?

09:43.875 --> 09:46.912
As of now,
this division's under quarantine.

09:53.676 --> 09:56.383
(siren wails)

10:02.018 --> 10:04.179
Gail Peck, my personal hero.

10:04.229 --> 10:06.094
Why? 'Cause I screwed up
everyone's night?

10:06.147 --> 10:09.014
Well, my wife did have concert tickets,
front row, center,

10:09.067 --> 10:10.603
which is not the kind of place
you want to be

10:10.652 --> 10:11.892
when you're a 30—something,

10:11.945 --> 10:13.606
and the concert
happens to be Taylor Swift.

10:13.655 --> 10:14.815
Best excuse ever.

10:14.864 --> 10:16.900
Tell me about it.
I don't have to host Book Club.

10:16.950 --> 10:19.566
I hate Book Club.
I'm so quitting Book Club.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.325
All right, everyone, let's get this going.

10:21.371 --> 10:23.703
Everyone, this is Barb
from Public Health.

10:23.748 --> 10:24.988
(all) Hey, Barb.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.656
Hi, everybody.

10:26.709 --> 10:30.042
Basically, Henry Lee is sick.
They don't know why.

10:30.088 --> 10:32.875
And since everyone from the division
has been exposed

10:32.924 --> 10:34.380
to whatever it is he has,

10:34.425 --> 10:35.926
Barb wants to make sure
we don't spread it.

10:35.969 --> 10:38.506
And it's just a precaution.
There's no reason to panic.

10:38.555 --> 10:40.967
It's all procedure. We're working
really hard to figure this out,

10:41.015 --> 10:43.506
so, with any luck,
you should be out of here soon.

10:43.560 --> 10:46.802
And, yes, you all will be paid
your overtime rates

10:46.855 --> 10:49.562
for the duration of the quarantine,
just like last time.

10:49.607 --> 10:50.892
Any other questions?

10:50.942 --> 10:52.557
(Sam and Jerry)
Yeah. When's the pizza get here?

10:52.610 --> 10:54.316
— (Oliver) Who's got the cards?
— (Jerry) Right here.

10:54.362 --> 10:56.353
Everybody loves a snow day.

10:57.365 --> 10:58.980
Is it contagious?

10:59.033 --> 11:01.649
Uh, we're not sure yet.

11:01.703 --> 11:04.911
I brought him in. He barfed on my head.
Am I gonna get sick?

11:04.956 --> 11:06.571
I mean, do you even know
what he's got?

11:06.624 --> 11:08.740
As soon as the disease is defined,

11:08.793 --> 11:13.082
Barb here will start you on any appropriate
medication... if you need it.

11:13.131 --> 11:15.087
In the meantime, uh, Diaz,

11:15.133 --> 11:18.000
I need you directing all calls
to the nearest division.

11:18.052 --> 11:20.714
Williams, with me.

11:26.269 --> 11:29.352
l have to phone the next shift,
have 'em report to 27.

11:29.397 --> 11:31.262
So you want me
to take half the list?

11:31.316 --> 11:33.978
Nope. Just like
having you around.

11:34.027 --> 11:36.734
It's like we're having a——
we're having a spa day.

11:36.779 --> 11:38.519
I'm on the puck, buddy.

11:38.573 --> 11:43.033
Well, this isn't, uh,
this isn't like "my ball, my call."

11:43.077 --> 11:45.409
Don't be such a baby, buddy.

11:45.455 --> 11:48.322
Hey, awfully eager
for the fish that always loses.

11:48.374 --> 11:52.868
Luck runs in streaks,
and mine is about to change.

11:55.632 --> 11:58.874
Oh, yeah. Where's Sammy?
I need to make some money.

11:58.927 --> 12:00.963
(mocking) "Where's Sammy?
I need to make some money."

12:01.012 --> 12:05.597
So I thought, uh, before I settle in
and take everybody's money,

12:05.642 --> 12:09.726
why don't we see if the threat of
imminent death gets blue guy talking?

12:09.771 --> 12:11.227
I thought there was
nothing to worry about.

12:11.272 --> 12:12.728
Blue guy doesn't know that.

12:12.774 --> 12:15.106
Okay, wait. There really is nothing
to worry about, right?

12:15.151 --> 12:17.483
We got quarantined for SARS in '03.
You know what happened?

12:17.528 --> 12:20.110
Snack machine ran dry,
Jerry started growing himself a goatee,

12:20.156 --> 12:22.238
and I took everybody's
money in poker.

12:22.283 --> 12:24.615
If Frank says don't worry,
don't worry.

12:24.661 --> 12:27.403
— Okay, but what if it is something?
— Then worry.

12:30.500 --> 12:33.788
Quarantine, huh?
That old chestnut.

12:33.836 --> 12:36.578
The guy you saw collapse earlier
is in the hospital,

12:36.631 --> 12:38.496
he's sick,
and he's contagious.

12:38.549 --> 12:40.926
Well, if we're in such grave danger,
why isn't she crying?

12:40.969 --> 12:42.960
You should be hysterical, right?

12:43.012 --> 12:45.503
Calling your boyfriend,
saying goodbye to mom and dad.

12:45.556 --> 12:47.262
Do I look like
I'm suppressing emotion?

12:47.308 --> 12:49.094
Is that the problem here?

12:49.143 --> 12:51.520
Maybe that's because, uh, well,

12:51.562 --> 12:53.268
my fiance just slept with his ex,

12:53.314 --> 12:54.815
I haven't seen my mother in years,

12:54.857 --> 12:56.438
my father is six months
off the bottle,

12:56.484 --> 12:58.224
and three weeks ago,
I almost died in a storage locker.

12:58.278 --> 13:02.772
So please... this quarantine thing?
Piece of cake.

13:04.367 --> 13:06.779
I like her. She got spunk.

13:06.828 --> 13:08.113
Yeah, can I punch him in the face?

13:08.162 --> 13:09.948
And fire, lots of fire.

13:09.998 --> 13:11.488
Just tell us where your partner is.

13:11.541 --> 13:13.247
— Just tell me what time it is.
— You first.

13:13.293 --> 13:15.625
— Can't do it.
— Okay.

13:15.670 --> 13:18.161
Protect your buddy.
Let him spend your cut

13:18.214 --> 13:20.956
while you die alone in jail.
I'm done here.

13:21.009 --> 13:24.217
McNally, take his dinner order.

13:27.098 --> 13:28.383
What do you want?

13:28.433 --> 13:30.970
— Your fiance slept with his ex?
— What do you want?

13:31.019 --> 13:32.475
Come on.
Seriously, what time is it?

13:32.520 --> 13:33.976
Fine, I'm gonna order for you.

13:34.605 --> 13:36.812
(door release buzzes, beeps)

13:36.858 --> 13:39.315
— I'm more than happy to split it.
— You saved my life.

13:39.360 --> 13:40.896
Good point.

13:40.945 --> 13:42.526
Hey. Did you get the message?

13:42.572 --> 13:44.153
— What?
— 15's on lockdown.

13:44.198 --> 13:45.324
What's the code?

13:45.366 --> 13:47.948
It's not a bomb. It's a quarantine.
I'm heading over now.

13:47.994 --> 13:49.154
They're not gonna let you inside.

13:49.203 --> 13:50.579
Well, we can sit here
and do nothing,

13:50.621 --> 13:52.236
or we can go over
and see if we could help.

13:52.290 --> 13:54.531
Uh,Luke,Sue.
Sue,Luke.

13:54.584 --> 13:57.166
Hey, how much have you had
to drink? l'll drive.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.374
You sure you're all right with this?

14:00.423 --> 14:02.163
Hey, near death, yellow tape...

14:02.216 --> 14:04.548
you and me,
it's becoming a thing for us.

14:09.057 --> 14:12.845
Okay, what——what about SARS?
Uh, "flu—like symptoms,

14:12.894 --> 14:16.102
"sudden onset of high fever,
chills, shivering..."

14:16.147 --> 14:18.103
lt——|t doesn't explain
the seizures, though.

14:18.149 --> 14:21.482
So SARS is out. Any other diseases
you want her to check?

14:21.527 --> 14:24.769
Shivering, nausea, difficulty breathing.

14:24.822 --> 14:26.687
— Try plague.
— (both) Plague?

14:26.741 --> 14:31.075
Yes, plague——bubonic,
pneumonic, cepticemic...

14:31.120 --> 14:33.236
Okay, uh, "plague." Um...

14:33.289 --> 14:35.530
"Symptoms include chills..." check,

14:35.583 --> 14:37.084
"fever. . check,

14:37.126 --> 14:40.459
"seizures..." double check,
and "swollen lymph nodes"?

14:40.505 --> 14:43.212
Did his nodes look swollen to you?

14:43.257 --> 14:45.213
I wasn't looking at his nodes.

14:45.259 --> 14:46.715
What about smallpox?

14:46.761 --> 14:49.218
Oh, please.
They eradicated smallpox.

14:49.263 --> 14:51.390
Did they? Because there's
two labs in the world

14:51.432 --> 14:54.265
that still have it——
Russia and Atlanta.

14:54.310 --> 14:56.722
If you knew that, maybe they would
have let you into medical school.

14:58.439 --> 14:59.724
"Smallpox."

15:00.441 --> 15:01.977
I'm feeling lucky.

15:03.444 --> 15:08.484
Oh, my God. Why didn't you let me
take him to the hospital?

15:08.533 --> 15:09.898
You didn't want to go to the hospital.

15:09.951 --> 15:11.441
You wanted to wash your hair.

15:11.494 --> 15:13.359
This is so not my fault, Traci.

15:13.413 --> 15:16.405
lt's nobody's fault. The guy was sick,
and we didn't know.

15:16.457 --> 15:18.573
Well, you should have known.
You're——You're a mom,

15:18.626 --> 15:20.582
and kids are like little petri dishes
of diseases.

15:20.628 --> 15:22.619
l'm hanging up now!

15:25.425 --> 15:26.289
Yeah.

15:26.384 --> 15:27.499
(Chris) Yeah.

15:29.303 --> 15:31.510
Would you still date me
if! looked like this?

15:31.556 --> 15:35.094
Yeah, probably.
No, not you, sir. Yeah.

15:35.143 --> 15:37.600
Hey. Who's calling in dinner?
I got blue guy's order.

15:37.645 --> 15:40.011
Oh. Just hold on, sir.

15:40.064 --> 15:42.271
Hey. So is he looking
navy blue or sky blue?

15:42.316 --> 15:45.274
— You haven't seen him?
— No, I've been stuck here all night.

15:45.319 --> 15:46.820
Really?

15:49.198 --> 15:51.940
— You want to put Chris in holding?
— Yeah.

15:51.993 --> 15:53.949
Uh, have you ever been undercover?

15:53.995 --> 15:56.953
Yeah. You remember? I, you know,
I was, uh, the——the gay...

15:56.998 --> 15:58.283
The prostitute.

15:58.332 --> 16:00.163
Oh, yeah. That's right.

16:00.209 --> 16:02.120
— White pants.
— (laughter)

16:02.170 --> 16:05.128
Well, uh, we appreciate
the initiative, but——

16:05.173 --> 16:07.755
You know what? I'm folding anyway.
We got nothin' to lose.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.415
McNally, you ready to prep him?

16:09.469 --> 16:10.925
— Yeah.
— Let's go.

16:12.597 --> 16:15.885
Okay, so blue guy really screwed up,
you know? He got caught.

16:15.933 --> 16:17.764
He's blue, obviously,

16:17.810 --> 16:19.141
and, uh, he's feeling
a bit embarrassed,

16:19.187 --> 16:21.303
so just make him like you, you know?

16:21.355 --> 16:22.435
Pretty likeable guy.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.097
(chuckles)

16:24.150 --> 16:26.983
Uh, swoosh this
like it's mouthwash.

16:27.028 --> 16:29.895
Good idea. That way, blue guy'll think
you pulled me in for being drunk.

16:29.947 --> 16:32.859
Okay, there's three things
we're looking for. Chris.

16:32.909 --> 16:34.319
— Name...
— Mm—hmm.

16:34.368 --> 16:36.324
his partner's name,
and his motive.

16:36.370 --> 16:38.235
Also, uh, he keeps asking
what time it is,

16:38.289 --> 16:40.575
so we think that maybe
his accomplice has another plan.

16:40.625 --> 16:42.581
That's why we have
to get to him now.

16:42.627 --> 16:44.663
— Mm—hmm.
— You can swallow now.

16:44.712 --> 16:47.704
Ahh. Wow. Burns.

16:47.757 --> 16:49.088
Yeah. Cuff him.

16:49.133 --> 16:50.964
(handcuffs click)

16:51.010 --> 16:52.250
Ooh.

16:52.303 --> 16:55.420
Ow, ow.

16:55.473 --> 16:56.929
Jeez.

16:56.974 --> 16:59.511
Hey, what's up.
Chris Diaz. Nice to meet ya.

17:01.729 --> 17:03.594
Got a little somethin' there.

17:03.648 --> 17:05.764
Cool.

17:05.816 --> 17:07.556
(sighs)

17:11.197 --> 17:12.607
What, are you kidding me?

17:16.536 --> 17:17.992
What?

17:22.166 --> 17:24.282
So you worried about
this quarantine thing?

17:24.335 --> 17:26.576
Know anything about it?

17:26.629 --> 17:28.039
No offense, man,

17:28.089 --> 17:30.330
but you look like you're
in pretty rough shape.

17:30.383 --> 17:33.420
Must hurt or, you know, itch.

17:33.469 --> 17:34.834
I don't know if you've
seen yourself lately,

17:34.887 --> 17:39.130
but you have blue all over,
all over your face and your hands.

17:39.183 --> 17:40.514
It's kind of like
that fake suntan stuff.

17:40.560 --> 17:41.925
You know, you ever heard
those people?

17:41.978 --> 17:43.593
You picked a real chameleon,
McNally.

17:43.646 --> 17:45.978
(chuckles) He's just charming him.
He's warming him up.

17:46.023 --> 17:48.730
Sam, you're missing a real
donk—fest over here, pal.

17:48.776 --> 17:50.858
You know, l'mjust——
I'm just getting loose here.

17:50.903 --> 17:53.485
Yeah? Just flopping a set ofjacks,
right under the gun.

17:53.531 --> 17:54.862
— You lead out?
— Of course.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.898
Then I filled it up on the turn.
Barber here——

17:56.951 --> 17:59.533
sorry, buddy——pushes all in,
last week's paycheck.

17:59.579 --> 18:02.286
Okay, you know what? Do me a favor.
Call, or shut your mouth.

18:02.331 --> 18:05.289
Looks like someone's getting
run over by the deck again.

18:05.334 --> 18:07.825
Yeah, well, if you ask me,
leading out's a bit amateur.

18:07.878 --> 18:09.960
They were my cards, I would have
checked—raise, smooth call,

18:10.006 --> 18:11.962
and taken the lead on the turn.

18:12.008 --> 18:13.919
(cell phone ringing)

18:16.554 --> 18:18.215
Callaghan.

18:18.264 --> 18:19.925
Buddy, what's going on in there?
Is everybody okay?

18:19.974 --> 18:22.465
Yeah, real good.
I just flopped a nut flush.

18:22.518 --> 18:24.429
You are never gonna guess
who I just took to the bank.

18:24.478 --> 18:26.514
Jerry followed you
all the way to the river.

18:26.564 --> 18:29.306
Yeah. You know,
we're fine. Go home.

18:29.358 --> 18:30.768
Like a B—movie out here.

18:30.818 --> 18:33.355
We got ambulances,
people in masks, it's——

18:33.404 --> 18:35.440
That's out of our control.
That's why we're playing poker.

18:35.489 --> 18:37.025
How's Andy?

18:37.074 --> 18:38.860
Um... great.

18:38.909 --> 18:42.197
She's, uh, working a case with Swarek.

18:42.246 --> 18:44.157
Just, uh...

18:45.541 --> 18:48.123
Just... you know,
just tell her I said hi.

18:48.169 --> 18:49.705
Okay.

18:51.631 --> 18:53.917
They're testing for all
the hemorrhagic fevers.

18:53.966 --> 18:57.129
It's not Ebola, Marburg,
Rift Valley. It's not hantavirus.

18:57.178 --> 18:59.169
They're gonna call as soon
as they know anything.

18:59.221 --> 19:01.633
I know Andy's in there, but there's nothing
we can do from out here,

19:01.682 --> 19:02.797
so can we drive you home?

19:02.850 --> 19:04.932
Yeah. Thanks.

19:06.187 --> 19:07.927
"Steak frites is a revelation——

19:07.980 --> 19:11.347
"tender angus beef adorned
with tiny matchstick fries."

19:11.400 --> 19:13.652
— Okay, Frank.
— Reservations.

19:15.029 --> 19:17.645
We have dinner together
every Friday.

19:17.698 --> 19:20.440
At first, we went dutch,
and we had a burger,

19:20.493 --> 19:24.827
but after that it got fancy.
You——You started paying.

19:24.872 --> 19:26.828
You have a problem with me
buying you dinner?

19:26.874 --> 19:28.990
(chuckles) No, it's great.
It's wonderful.

19:29.043 --> 19:31.284
I could eat steak every Friday.

19:31.337 --> 19:34.670
I could eat steak
every Friday with you.

19:34.715 --> 19:35.795
It's just...

19:35.841 --> 19:37.126
(knock on door)

19:37.176 --> 19:39.007
Uh, pizza?

19:39.053 --> 19:40.634
That's great.

19:40.680 --> 19:43.672
Uh, I'm actually starving.
Thank you.

19:43.724 --> 19:45.510
— Uh—huh.
— Thank you.

19:45.559 --> 19:47.470
(laughs nervously)

19:52.316 --> 19:54.147
Did you get any pizza?

19:54.193 --> 19:56.684
I'm not eating.

19:56.737 --> 19:59.854
My stomach is killing me,
and I'm sweating,

19:59.907 --> 20:01.363
and my nodes are swollen.

20:01.409 --> 20:04.071
Your nodes are swollen?

20:04.120 --> 20:05.985
Or you could be
freaking yourself out.

20:06.038 --> 20:07.574
What do you know?

20:07.623 --> 20:10.114
I worked SARS, swine flu, bird flu.

20:10.167 --> 20:11.907
I spent more time calming people down

20:11.961 --> 20:13.826
than I did treating people
who were sick.

20:13.879 --> 20:15.540
You need to eat something.

20:15.589 --> 20:19.923
Okay, fine, but if I'm patient zero,
shouldn't I be isolating myself?

20:19.969 --> 20:22.255
If it gets worse,
we'll deal with it then.

20:22.304 --> 20:23.760
Eat.

20:29.937 --> 20:31.928
Okay.

20:31.981 --> 20:33.096
What time is it?

20:33.149 --> 20:35.060
Meat lovers for the blue guy.
Hawaiian for the hustler.

20:35.109 --> 20:36.224
Thanks.

20:39.196 --> 20:41.903
— You're a prostitute?
— Don'tjudge me.

20:41.949 --> 20:43.780
Yeah, 'cause I'm
in a real position to mock.

20:43.826 --> 20:45.236
All right. Enjoy your dinner.

20:45.286 --> 20:47.993
Hey. Come on.
Just tell me what time it is.

20:48.038 --> 20:49.653
Tell me your name,
I'll tell you what time it is.

20:50.833 --> 20:52.323
Yeah. I didn't think so.

20:54.420 --> 20:56.160
You robbed a bank.

20:57.214 --> 20:58.750
You like pineapple
on your pizza?

20:59.550 --> 21:00.539
How much money you get?

21:00.760 --> 21:02.250
(blue guy) How much money you get?

21:03.012 --> 21:04.252
Why are you blue?

21:04.305 --> 21:06.512
God help me, is this what
it's gonna be like in jail?

21:06.557 --> 21:07.967
I couldn't tell ya.
I've only been there once.

21:08.017 --> 21:09.097
Couple weeks for possession.

21:09.143 --> 21:10.724
Tell me something,
if! kill you right now,

21:10.770 --> 21:12.431
you think I'll get a room to myself?

21:13.731 --> 21:17.315
(chucang)

21:17.359 --> 21:19.771
If I robbed a bank,
the first thing I'd buy is a dog.

21:19.820 --> 21:22.436
Then a Harley. Then I'd probably
move down to California

21:22.490 --> 21:24.902
and get one of those trailer things
by the beach, you know,

21:24.950 --> 21:27.111
and a surfboard, wet suit——
a couple of 'em.

21:27.161 --> 21:28.446
I think I'd look pretty good
in one of those.

21:28.496 --> 21:29.861
Would you please shut up?!

21:29.914 --> 21:33.031
I'm just saying, man, that's what I'd do
if I stole a whole whack of cash.

21:33.083 --> 21:35.290
Well, hey, I didn't steal anything,
all right?!

21:40.633 --> 21:43.170
(sighs)

21:43.219 --> 21:45.710
Bank took something from me.

21:45.763 --> 21:48.300
| just took it back.

21:48.349 --> 21:49.304
Okay. My deal.

21:49.350 --> 21:52.137
You know the guy that was beat up——
is he a branch manager?

21:52.186 --> 21:53.642
Yeah, he is.

21:53.687 --> 21:55.473
So he's responsible
for mortgages, loans?

21:55.523 --> 21:57.559
— Yeah.
— Maybe he was targeted.

21:57.608 --> 21:59.724
I mean, maybe this guy has a beef
with his neighborhood branch.

21:59.777 --> 22:01.187
Did blue guy say somethin'?

22:01.237 --> 22:03.023
Yeah, Chris just got him talking.
He said he didn't steal anything.

22:03.072 --> 22:04.482
He just took it back.

22:04.532 --> 22:06.523
Is the branch manager
still at Victoria Mercy?

22:06.575 --> 22:08.531
Yeah, as far as I know.

22:12.289 --> 22:14.280
— Who are you calling?
— 27 Division.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.198
They might as well head over there
with blue guy's mug shot,

22:16.252 --> 22:17.583
see if they can get an ID.

22:17.628 --> 22:19.414
No! Hang up.
Hang it up! Hang it up!

22:19.463 --> 22:21.579
— What, what, what?!
— Just... listen.

22:21.632 --> 22:23.873
We're on quarantine, right,
and as far as we know,

22:23.926 --> 22:27.259
this might be our last case,
so do we really want to give it up?

22:27.304 --> 22:30.341
I played hockey
against those guys last season.

22:30.391 --> 22:32.427
Bunch of cheatin' bitches at 27.

22:32.476 --> 22:34.512
All right, so then who's out there
that's on our team?

22:34.562 --> 22:37.349
Callaghan...
and, uh, I think he's with Dov.

22:37.398 --> 22:41.186
Luke, huh? Well, might as well,
uh, give him a call.

22:48.033 --> 22:49.409
(keying numbers)

22:50.995 --> 22:52.735
(ring, beep)
Callaghan.

22:52.788 --> 22:55.700
Hey, we have a lead on
the Broadway Mutual Bank robbery.

22:55.749 --> 22:57.159
— Andy?
— Yeah, um, listen...

22:57.209 --> 22:59.495
I'm gonna e—mail you guys
over a mug shot.

22:59.545 --> 23:02.378
I need you to go over there and get an ID
from the branch manager.

23:02.423 --> 23:03.583
Is the quarantine over?

23:03.632 --> 23:05.543
What's going on?
Are you guys okay?

23:05.593 --> 23:07.879
Uh, the branch manager's
at Victoria Mercy.

23:07.928 --> 23:10.590
Uh, we think he might know
the suspect.

23:11.724 --> 23:12.884
You got all that?

23:12.933 --> 23:15.800
Yeah. Broadway Mutual Bank.
Suspect lD.

23:15.853 --> 23:17.718
I'll call you if we get anything.

23:17.771 --> 23:21.639
— Okay. Good.
— Hey, Andy. I miss you.

23:21.692 --> 23:23.774
Yep. Yep. Yeah, okay.

23:24.904 --> 23:26.314
How'd that go for ya?

23:33.704 --> 23:37.117
Henry Lee is not responding
to any of the medication

23:37.166 --> 23:38.997
that they're giving him.

23:39.043 --> 23:41.204
So, what if I have what he has?

23:41.253 --> 23:42.914
I gotta call Leo. l have to.

23:42.963 --> 23:45.340
No,no,no,no,no,no.
You don't want to wake him up

23:45.382 --> 23:47.247
in the middle of the night
and scare him to death

23:47.301 --> 23:50.919
over something that's probably, uh——
Look, nothing's gonna happen.

23:50.971 --> 23:53.804
You're right. You're right.
You're right. (sighs)

23:53.849 --> 23:56.761
Okay, well, is there any other news
on this Henry Lee guy?

23:56.810 --> 24:00.428
27 sent a car over to the guy's house.
He's got no friends.

24:00.481 --> 24:02.312
No Friday night at the neighbors'.
No next of kin.

24:02.358 --> 24:04.189
Did you track down any co—workers?

24:04.234 --> 24:06.225
— Game, set, match! Shaw!
— I knew it!

24:06.278 --> 24:07.438
Okay, wait. Hold on.

24:07.488 --> 24:08.978
You donkey!
You spiked the king!

24:09.031 --> 24:12.068
Uh, no the guy works 9—to—5
skimming ponds

24:12.117 --> 24:13.948
at the filtration plant, alone.

24:13.994 --> 24:15.985
See, that's the thing. Nobody
knows anything about this guy.

24:16.038 --> 24:17.699
You're telling me
this poor guy's entire life

24:17.748 --> 24:19.613
is spent wading through pond scum?

24:19.667 --> 24:23.910
That just opens up a whole new
world of biochemical horror.

24:23.963 --> 24:26.545
Jerry, if anything
happens to me...

24:26.590 --> 24:29.423
Nothing is gonna happen to you.

24:29.468 --> 24:31.424
| just wish I was there with you.

24:34.264 --> 24:36.926
Hang on a second.
The doctor's back.

24:40.938 --> 24:42.394
How long ago?

24:42.439 --> 24:43.895
Just now.

24:43.941 --> 24:45.772
— What is he saying?
— Still don't know what it is?

24:45.818 --> 24:47.524
No. We're still running tests.

24:49.405 --> 24:51.270
Traci, what's happening?

24:51.323 --> 24:53.188
Henry Lee...

24:55.411 --> 24:57.242
he just died.

25:02.960 --> 25:06.452
All right, listen up, everyone!
Barb has got some news for us.

25:06.505 --> 25:08.996
All right, right.
What, 40—ounce flu?

25:09.049 --> 25:10.880
Henry Lee died.

25:10.926 --> 25:11.756
VVhen?

25:11.802 --> 25:14.259
About 20 minutes ago.
Uh, the good news is,

25:14.304 --> 25:16.841
we can do an autopsy now,
start figuring this thing out.

25:16.890 --> 25:18.926
I think that makes us all
feel a lot better, Barb.

25:18.976 --> 25:21.763
Well, what did he die of?
What did he have?

25:21.812 --> 25:23.677
We don't know yet.
I'm sorry.

25:23.731 --> 25:25.517
I know this must be very stressful,

25:25.566 --> 25:26.976
but until we know what it is,

25:27.026 --> 25:29.233
I'm afraid no one's going
anywhere.

25:29.278 --> 25:32.395
Now, listen, Peck has been
in primary contact with the victim.

25:32.448 --> 25:34.484
Until further notice,
she's staying in my office,

25:34.533 --> 25:36.148
not to be disturbed.

25:36.201 --> 25:38.863
My team is gonna be
setting up over there.

25:38.912 --> 25:41.995
We want to start taking
temperatures, blood pressure.

25:42.041 --> 25:44.077
We just want to monitor
what's happening.

25:46.420 --> 25:49.287
I'm gonna hit the snack machine
before Oliver empties it.

25:49.339 --> 25:51.250
— Do you want anything?
— No.

25:51.300 --> 25:52.380
No? You sure?

25:52.426 --> 25:53.632
— Yeah.
— Okay.

25:53.677 --> 25:56.635
You know, if that guy had just
come in an hour later,

25:56.680 --> 25:59.797
I would've been
at the Taylor Swift concert...

25:59.850 --> 26:02.842
teasing my wife about
her middle—aged lady dancing.

26:02.895 --> 26:04.726
Yeah, well, I would've
been at Book Club,

26:04.772 --> 26:07.013
dissecting Jonathan Franzen.

26:07.066 --> 26:10.024
Come on, sweetie.
Answer the phone.

26:10.069 --> 26:11.855
You're not calling anybody?

26:11.904 --> 26:15.146
My parents are asleep.
So's my sister.

26:15.657 --> 26:17.397
Guess I should get checked out.

26:20.621 --> 26:21.610
What if we're sick?

26:23.582 --> 26:24.662
Then we're sick.

26:25.501 --> 26:26.411
Okay, try your wife again.

26:26.460 --> 26:28.576
— No, she's not answering.
— Third time's a charm.

26:31.048 --> 26:33.414
(keys numbers)

26:36.845 --> 26:39.928
Hey! Hi, darlin'.

26:40.432 --> 26:42.263
(deep exhalation)
It's good to hear your voice.

26:42.309 --> 26:44.174
Yeah. Yeah.

26:44.895 --> 26:46.931
So maybe I should take this one?

26:46.980 --> 26:48.561
I got it, Epstein.

26:48.607 --> 26:51.565
No, I know you do,
but you've had a couple, so...

26:54.321 --> 26:55.606
Okay.

26:56.615 --> 26:57.900
Sorry.

26:57.950 --> 27:01.067
Hey, nobody's exploded.
For me, that's a pretty good night.

27:02.329 --> 27:04.615
Mr. Dhawan,
I'm sorry to wake you.

27:04.665 --> 27:06.030
It's okay. What do you need?

27:06.083 --> 27:08.244
l'm Detective Luke Callaghan
from 15 Division.

27:08.293 --> 27:10.033
We believe we may have
one of the men in custody

27:10.087 --> 27:11.577
who robbed your bank yesterday.

27:11.630 --> 27:13.586
That's great,
but I already told you guys,

27:13.632 --> 27:15.873
I didn't see their faces.
They had masks on.

27:15.926 --> 27:17.632
Right, but they took them off
when they went outside,

27:17.678 --> 27:19.259
which is when
the dye pack went off.

27:19.304 --> 27:21.260
We have a photo. Epstein?

27:25.853 --> 27:27.434
This guy's a client.

27:27.479 --> 27:29.720
We foreclosed on his mortgage
three months ago.

27:29.773 --> 27:32.014
He lost his job.
He couldn't make his payments.

27:32.067 --> 27:34.479
— Was he angry?
— We took his house away.

27:35.654 --> 27:38.066
It was bank policy.
I told him that.

27:38.115 --> 27:39.400
What was his name?

27:39.449 --> 27:43.738
Mitchell. James Mitchell.

27:43.787 --> 27:45.652
You think I like waking up
every morning

27:45.706 --> 27:47.537
next to a woman
who doesn't respect me?

27:47.583 --> 27:50.325
Maybe l'd respect you more
if you supported me more.

27:50.377 --> 27:52.834
Well, maybe l'd support you more
if you were nicer to me,

27:52.880 --> 27:55.587
if I wasn't the source of
every problem you've ever had.

27:55.632 --> 27:57.213
Shut up!

27:57.259 --> 27:59.215
I'm scared, all right?

27:59.261 --> 28:02.378
And all I can hear is you two
screaming at each other,

28:02.431 --> 28:03.420
hating each other,

28:03.473 --> 28:05.054
when right now I would give anything

28:05.100 --> 28:06.965
to be with the people that I love!

28:07.644 --> 28:09.509
(sighs) Sorry.

28:09.563 --> 28:11.269
We're sorry, Traci.

28:11.315 --> 28:14.807
My son is 7 years old, and he's asleep,
and I can't call him.

28:16.195 --> 28:18.811
Maybe you could
write him a letter.

28:18.864 --> 28:21.856
You know, it might
make you feel better.

28:21.909 --> 28:25.743
Or you could make him a video.

28:27.873 --> 28:30.660
(Martin) All right.
Uh, ready when you are.

28:30.709 --> 28:32.665
It's not a goodbye.

28:32.711 --> 28:36.420
Okay. You're right.
It's not a goodbye.

28:36.465 --> 28:38.376
— Okay.
— Okay.

28:38.425 --> 28:40.290
We're rolling.

28:41.762 --> 28:44.174
Hi, sweetie.

28:44.223 --> 28:45.963
I'm at work right now,

28:46.016 --> 28:48.928
um, and I don't know why,

28:48.977 --> 28:51.354
but I keep thinking...

28:51.396 --> 28:53.682
you know how when it's raining

28:53.732 --> 28:55.893
and, um, you're stuck inside,

28:55.943 --> 28:58.025
and I won't let you watch TV,

28:58.070 --> 29:01.528
but, um, I always tell you
that you have to make something,

29:01.573 --> 29:04.781
and you do, and it's fantastic,

29:04.826 --> 29:07.693
because you have made
a car out of a box

29:07.746 --> 29:10.362
or a bus out of a box

29:10.415 --> 29:13.873
or a rocket ship out of a box?

29:13.919 --> 29:16.251
Well, here's a little secret.

29:16.296 --> 29:18.878
I love the rain.

29:18.924 --> 29:20.915
I can't wait for the rain,

29:20.968 --> 29:23.550
because then I can be ready

29:23.595 --> 29:26.052
with a cardboard box,

29:26.098 --> 29:30.262
because that is my favorite thing
to watch you do.

29:33.146 --> 29:36.058
I love you so much, my darling.

29:36.108 --> 29:37.939
I do.

29:47.035 --> 29:48.411
That okay?

29:48.453 --> 29:52.321
Yeah. It was great.

30:01.466 --> 30:02.797
What are you doing?

30:02.843 --> 30:05.380
I'm just trying to put
the pieces together... James.

30:08.473 --> 30:11.590
Or do you prefer "Jim"
or "Jimmy"?

30:11.643 --> 30:16.478
'Cause we got a branch manager
who just lD'd you as James Mitchell,

30:16.523 --> 30:18.479
but whatever you wanna go by.

30:18.525 --> 30:21.483
Personally I kinda like, uh, blue guy.

30:21.528 --> 30:23.610
What else do we know about you?

30:23.655 --> 30:26.738
Uh, you're married... for eight years.

30:26.783 --> 30:29.775
You and your wife Julie
just got evicted from your house,

30:29.828 --> 30:32.444
and pretty much
all you have in the world

30:32.497 --> 30:34.704
is, uh, one belt,

30:34.750 --> 30:37.116
one watch...

30:37.169 --> 30:38.659
$40...

30:38.712 --> 30:41.374
and, uh, 40 cents.

30:43.342 --> 30:45.549
Wait. Where's his ring?

30:45.594 --> 30:46.925
What ring?

30:46.970 --> 30:49.507
Well, there's a line around his finger
where a ring used to be.

30:49.556 --> 30:51.296
I mean, I tried talking to him
about his wife,

30:51.350 --> 30:53.181
but he wouldn't say anything.

30:57.647 --> 30:59.933
(door release buzzes, beeps)

30:59.983 --> 31:02.360
Hey, uh, can I talk to you
for a second?

31:04.363 --> 31:07.446
Excuse me, blue guy.
I'll be right back.

31:14.748 --> 31:15.828
What is it?

31:15.874 --> 31:17.910
So if you look at his hand,
you can tell

31:17.959 --> 31:20.450
that he was wearing a wedding ring
when the dye pack exploded.

31:20.504 --> 31:22.540
Yeah, I know.
It's not in his bag.

31:22.589 --> 31:25.547
Yeah, remember when we arrested him,
he swallowed something?

31:25.592 --> 31:27.548
Guess he didn't want us
to know about his marriage.

31:27.594 --> 31:30.631
No wonder
he's protecting his partner.

31:30.680 --> 31:33.171
Because his partner is his partner.

31:33.225 --> 31:35.136
His wife.

31:40.899 --> 31:44.983
Uh, we think Mitchell's partner
on the bank job was his wife.

31:45.028 --> 31:47.690
Yeah, her name's Julie.
She's 42. No kids.

31:47.739 --> 31:48.819
Okay, where is she now?

31:48.865 --> 31:50.821
Well, looking at Mitchell's
credit card statements,

31:50.867 --> 31:52.858
they were staying
at a Super 8 Motel

31:52.911 --> 31:54.526
just outside the city
for almost two months,

31:54.579 --> 31:56.535
and the credit ran out
four days ago.

31:56.581 --> 31:58.572
So, let's think this through.

31:58.625 --> 32:00.365
— Who's that?
— That's Sue from Bomb Squad.

32:00.419 --> 32:01.750
Dov's on a date.

32:01.795 --> 32:04.377
Okay, you're my husband.

32:04.423 --> 32:05.959
Okay.

32:06.007 --> 32:09.135
We rob a bank. Dye pack goes off.
I'm blue. Maybe you're blue.

32:09.177 --> 32:11.589
Well, at least we're blue together.
I mean, that's good.

32:12.722 --> 32:13.757
Augh.

32:13.807 --> 32:16.549
— But we still have to hide.
— 'Cause the fuzz is on our tail.

32:16.601 --> 32:18.216
Right. Five—O.
Can't shake 'em.

32:18.270 --> 32:19.385
So, where do we go?

32:19.438 --> 32:21.053
Well, we can't go back to the motel.

32:21.106 --> 32:22.892
No, and can't call our friends.
I mean, why risk it?

32:22.941 --> 32:25.227
Give me that.

32:25.277 --> 32:27.563
The, uh, the drugstore
where you picked him up——

32:27.612 --> 32:29.227
was it anywhere
around his house?

32:29.281 --> 32:31.943
Yeah, same area.
What, like, four blocks away?

32:31.992 --> 32:33.402
That's it, then.

32:33.452 --> 32:35.943
Our house.
Our foreclosed house.

32:35.996 --> 32:38.032
Nobody's in it. It's perfect.

32:38.081 --> 32:40.618
So, would you and | go home?

32:40.667 --> 32:42.203
(chuckles)

32:42.252 --> 32:44.584
— Andy, you got an address?
— 339 Cowan.

32:44.629 --> 32:46.620
All right. Call 27 Division.

32:46.673 --> 32:48.629
Get 'em to meet us there
with a couple of units.

32:48.675 --> 32:51.087
lwill do that. Will do.

32:53.180 --> 32:54.920
(sighs) What a night, huh?

32:54.973 --> 32:56.759
Tell me about it.

33:01.897 --> 33:02.977
I want to have a baby.

33:06.067 --> 33:06.931
Excuse me?

33:06.985 --> 33:09.067
lt's——lt's not just that
I want to have one,

33:09.112 --> 33:11.728
I'm actually trying——
have been trying.

33:11.781 --> 33:15.319
That's why I work so much overtime.
Saving up for lVF.

33:15.368 --> 33:16.904
And I'm gonna do one last round,

33:16.953 --> 33:19.490
and, uh, you know,
since we started having dinner to——

33:19.539 --> 33:21.075
Okay, I don't know
where I'm going with this.

33:21.124 --> 33:24.662
Anyway, ljust wanted you
to know, before we...

33:25.504 --> 33:26.584
have any more dinners.

33:26.630 --> 33:28.461
Oh, okay.

33:28.507 --> 33:30.293
Okay... what?

33:34.471 --> 33:36.962
Frank, what are we doing here?

33:39.976 --> 33:41.136
I don't know. (laughs nervously)

33:42.395 --> 33:43.805
Okay.

33:43.855 --> 33:45.186
Noelle.

33:45.232 --> 33:46.472
Wait!

33:55.367 --> 33:56.857
Don't.

33:56.910 --> 33:58.241
No.

33:58.286 --> 33:59.947
I might have infected everybody,

33:59.996 --> 34:01.577
and I don't want to get you sick——
especially not you.

34:01.623 --> 34:02.988
Gail, open the door.

34:03.041 --> 34:04.406
— No.
— Gail.

34:04.459 --> 34:07.041
— No!
— Open the door.

34:10.006 --> 34:11.837
(lock clicks)

34:13.677 --> 34:15.167
— Chris, seriously...
— Come here.

34:15.220 --> 34:17.461
— No. I don't want to get you sick.
— Why?

34:17.514 --> 34:19.050
Because then you're
gonna get infected...

34:19.099 --> 34:20.930
— Shut up.
— and you're gonna die.

34:28.692 --> 34:31.183
Let's just say we did
some police work,

34:31.236 --> 34:32.976
and we found out
where your partner is,

34:33.029 --> 34:35.111
who your partner is——

34:35.156 --> 34:37.693
Julie, your wife.

34:38.451 --> 34:39.577
You keep guessing.

34:39.619 --> 34:40.950
No, you know what?
We're done guessing.

34:40.996 --> 34:44.159
We've got units on their way
over to your old house right now,

34:44.207 --> 34:45.993
and they need to know
what they're walking into.

34:46.042 --> 34:47.543
You robbed a bank with a gun,

34:47.586 --> 34:49.668
and if you don't have it,
your wife does.

34:49.713 --> 34:51.499
If she makes a move to use it,
they're gonna shoot her.

34:51.548 --> 34:54.836
That's how it works,
so you better start talking now.

34:56.261 --> 34:58.047
The gun was fake.

34:58.096 --> 35:00.052
You told us nothing all night.
Why would we believe that?

35:00.098 --> 35:01.929
We didn't use a real gun.

35:03.018 --> 35:04.474
We didn't want to hurt anybody.

35:04.519 --> 35:05.884
Yeah, especially
the branch manager.

35:05.937 --> 35:07.643
Wasn't supposed to happen that way.
We were supposed to go in,

35:07.689 --> 35:09.600
we were supposed to get
the money and get out.

35:11.234 --> 35:13.520
(sighs)

35:13.570 --> 35:16.653
| just wish he hadn't been there.

35:16.698 --> 35:18.609
| wish I hadn't seen him,
but I did.

35:18.658 --> 35:20.523
I saw him, and ljust——| lost it.

35:20.577 --> 35:22.283
You put him in the hospital.

35:22.329 --> 35:23.739
He put us on the street.

35:27.167 --> 35:28.327
We had a house...

35:28.376 --> 35:29.912
jobs...

35:29.961 --> 35:32.168
a life...

35:32.213 --> 35:34.374
and then within a month,

35:34.424 --> 35:36.085
we both got laid off.

35:36.134 --> 35:37.840
That was a year ago.

35:37.886 --> 35:41.549
(laughs to himself)
Yeah, what a year.

35:41.598 --> 35:44.806
We asked the bank to help.
We asked him. We begged him.

35:44.851 --> 35:46.591
"Please give us a break.
Give us...

35:46.645 --> 35:48.681
"Just give us
a little more time."

35:48.730 --> 35:52.894
Nope. Nope, nope, nope.

35:52.942 --> 35:55.809
Do you have any idea
what it's like to lose everything?

35:55.862 --> 36:00.105
You don't exist. Nobody cares.

36:00.158 --> 36:01.944
Please don't hurt her.

36:03.578 --> 36:05.660
She's it.

36:05.705 --> 36:07.696
She's all I got.

36:12.420 --> 36:14.285
So should I take you home now?

36:14.339 --> 36:16.751
Yeah, I guess you should, 'cause,
you know, this is really boring.

36:16.800 --> 36:18.882
All right. Let's do this.

36:18.927 --> 36:21.043
Name's Julie Mitchell.
42. Brunette.

36:21.096 --> 36:22.757
She may be armed,
so let's look sharp.

36:22.806 --> 36:25.593
Back's already covered,
so we're going in the front door.

36:25.642 --> 36:27.678
We'll clear the main floor
before working our way up.

36:27.727 --> 36:29.683
— Any questions?
— (Dov and Sue) No, sir.

36:29.729 --> 36:32.220
— Dov, you wanna take this?
— Are you serious?

36:32.273 --> 36:34.400
Just don't make me look bad.

36:53.837 --> 36:55.452
Main floor's clear.

37:16.067 --> 37:17.682
Julie Mitchell?

37:17.736 --> 37:19.476
Hands in the air
where I can see 'em.

37:19.529 --> 37:20.985
Now.

37:23.199 --> 37:25.064
Looks like you're going somewhere.

37:25.118 --> 37:29.077
l was supposed to leave
if he wasn't back by sunrise.

37:29.122 --> 37:31.158
l was supposed to get away.

37:31.207 --> 37:33.163
Where was I gonna go?

37:33.209 --> 37:35.074
This house is the whole reason
we took the money.

37:35.128 --> 37:36.743
It's everything we had.

37:38.256 --> 37:39.336
Couldn't leave it.

37:41.843 --> 37:43.049
Couldn't leave him.

37:49.350 --> 37:50.681
Suspect in custody.

37:50.727 --> 37:52.934
(dispatcher) Copy that.

37:59.486 --> 38:01.898
(telephone ringing)

38:04.199 --> 38:05.814
H—Hello?

38:07.368 --> 38:09.450
Really?

38:09.496 --> 38:10.702
Okay.

38:11.956 --> 38:13.662
Yeah. Okay.

38:13.708 --> 38:16.290
Uh... thank you.

38:20.089 --> 38:21.704
Charlotte?

38:23.468 --> 38:25.174
It's not contagious.

38:25.220 --> 38:26.505
What?

38:26.554 --> 38:28.385
We're getting out of here.

38:28.431 --> 38:30.217
(sighs)

38:33.978 --> 38:35.843
Dex, hey. Hi. I'm sorry.

38:35.897 --> 38:39.389
I know that it's early,
but, um, when Leo wakes up,

38:39.442 --> 38:41.057
can you please tell him
that I am coming

38:41.110 --> 38:43.146
to pick him up for breakfast?

38:43.196 --> 38:45.938
Yes, everything is fine.

38:48.117 --> 38:51.860
Henry Lee cleaned the ponds
at the filtration plant.

38:51.913 --> 38:56.327
Somehow he contracted primary
amoebic meningoencephalitis.

38:56.376 --> 38:57.786
What is that?

38:57.836 --> 39:00.669
It's an amoeba you get
from warm water.

39:00.713 --> 39:01.964
And it's not contagious.

39:02.006 --> 39:04.463
It's not at all contagious.
Everybody can go home.

39:04.509 --> 39:08.093
(cheenng)

39:08.137 --> 39:10.093
Bud, I'll see you.

39:10.139 --> 39:12.755
— I'll see you tomorrow, brother.
— Yes, so will I.

39:12.809 --> 39:14.015
That was a long day.

39:17.981 --> 39:20.597
(man chuckles)
I shouldn't be laughing.

39:20.650 --> 39:22.561
Listen, uh, I'm thinking about
going to the Black Penny

39:22.610 --> 39:24.146
for breakfast. You in?

39:24.195 --> 39:28.438
I can't, but, uh, I have something
you need to do right now.

39:28.491 --> 39:29.822
Come here.

39:32.912 --> 39:35.153
(Jerry) Got someone here
to see you, James.

39:38.001 --> 39:39.537
You're safe.

39:41.296 --> 39:43.457
(The Mostar Diving Club's
"Forever Goodbye" playing)

39:44.424 --> 39:47.086
You okay? Yeah?

39:47.385 --> 39:50.001
I'm so sorry.

39:50.054 --> 39:51.669
Me, too.

39:51.723 --> 39:55.932
J‘ I said all I needed to say J‘

39:57.604 --> 40:02.314
J‘ Now we can both be
on our way J‘

40:09.282 --> 40:12.615
J‘ Hello to you, sunny road J‘

40:15.038 --> 40:19.998
J‘ Was it as good
as l have been told? J‘

40:20.043 --> 40:24.377
J‘ I heard that the stars
are so bright J‘

40:26.132 --> 40:29.295
J‘ I hear that it was
such a sight J‘

40:29.344 --> 40:31.756
Too bad Dov's not here
for the lockdown.

40:31.804 --> 40:33.340
Wonder how his date went.

40:33.389 --> 40:36.051
— It's Dov.
— Yeah, you're right.

40:36.100 --> 40:38.512
Poor Dov.

40:40.021 --> 40:41.352
Wow.

40:41.397 --> 40:43.604
We're having breakfast together.

40:43.650 --> 40:46.938
|——| don't actually——| don't always
do that on a first date.

40:46.986 --> 40:49.193
Well, it wasn't exactly
how I planned it, but...

40:49.238 --> 40:51.775
Yeah, but that's why
I had so much fun.

40:51.824 --> 40:53.985
J‘ Show me the good times J‘

40:55.912 --> 40:58.494
J‘ Just make it come alive J‘

41:01.209 --> 41:04.827
J‘ | only want one night J‘

41:07.674 --> 41:09.084
What are we doing?

41:14.514 --> 41:15.924
You need to hit something.

41:15.974 --> 41:17.555
Hit what?

41:21.270 --> 41:22.851
Me.

41:22.897 --> 41:26.105
(scoffs)
