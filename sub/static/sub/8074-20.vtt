00:03.871 --> 00:08.742
[theme music]

00:49.583 --> 00:52.520
[roseanne laughing]

00:52.553 --> 00:55.456
[car engine starts]

00:59.527 --> 01:00.494
All right.

01:00.528 --> 01:01.895
So I'll lock up.

01:01.929 --> 01:03.397
I've just got to put
some more chairs up.

01:03.431 --> 01:05.333
See you later Bye, Rob.

01:16.510 --> 01:18.045
Wow!

01:18.078 --> 01:20.047
(TOGETHER) Hi, Roseanne!

01:20.080 --> 01:21.549
How are you?

01:21.582 --> 01:24.051
Hello, dear.

01:24.084 --> 01:26.354
ROSEANNE: Oh no,
not June Cleaver!

01:26.387 --> 01:27.188
Wow.

01:31.225 --> 01:32.092
Wow.

01:32.126 --> 01:35.363
Beautiful pearls, June.

01:35.396 --> 01:39.633
My god, it's Lassie's
mom and the 'don't eat

01:39.667 --> 01:41.369
the daisies' mom.

01:41.402 --> 01:46.840
And the mom from the Wonder
Bread, Wonder Bra, whatever.

01:46.874 --> 01:50.043
And Wheezy!

01:50.077 --> 01:52.146
I love all you guys, I
can't believe you're here.

01:52.180 --> 01:53.414
What are you doing here?

01:53.447 --> 01:54.882
We're the sitcom
mom welcome wagon.

01:54.915 --> 01:55.783
Well, yeah.

01:55.816 --> 01:57.218
Well it's been seven years.

01:57.251 --> 01:59.587
What took you so long?

01:59.620 --> 02:01.455
We had to make
sure you'd last.

02:01.489 --> 02:04.158
So many families move
into our neighborhood

02:04.192 --> 02:07.761
and they're gone in 13 weeks.

02:07.795 --> 02:09.330
I can't tell you
what this means to me.

02:09.363 --> 02:12.900
I'm so honored that
you guys like my show.

02:12.933 --> 02:17.838
Well actually, we
haven't seen your show.

02:17.871 --> 02:19.973
But we heard a few things.

02:25.045 --> 02:30.451
Elizabeth Montgomery was
shocked, and she's a witch.

02:30.484 --> 02:34.054
You see, Roseanne, we've all
worked very hard to promote

02:34.087 --> 02:36.390
the image of motherhood.

02:36.424 --> 02:38.959
And if what we've heard
about your show is true,

02:38.992 --> 02:44.332
well, we're about as mad as
H-E double hockey sticks.

02:44.365 --> 02:47.301
You'll excuse my French.

02:47.335 --> 02:51.405
Well, whatever you heard
is a hell of a damn lie.

02:51.439 --> 02:54.775
Well, I'm afraid you're going
to have to prove it, dear.

02:54.808 --> 02:58.011
Hey, I'm just as
wholesome as any of you.

02:58.045 --> 02:59.513
I ain't the one that
named my kid Beaver.

03:05.319 --> 03:06.320
I'm serious, mother.

03:06.354 --> 03:09.223
Bacon is loaded with
sodium, nitrites,

03:09.257 --> 03:12.260
grease, and animal fat.

03:12.293 --> 03:13.160
Breakfast!

03:17.164 --> 03:20.067
Hey, I thought you
had pep squad today.

03:20.100 --> 03:21.702
I'm quitting pep squad,
I'm quitting school,

03:21.735 --> 03:23.537
I'm never going back again.

03:23.571 --> 03:25.839
And if anybody calls
me tell them I'm dead!

03:25.873 --> 03:27.508
Well, it must be serious.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.610
She's not taking phone calls.

03:29.643 --> 03:30.544
Where is she?

03:30.578 --> 03:32.079
Where is my sister?

03:32.112 --> 03:33.146
She went upstairs.

03:33.180 --> 03:34.047
Aha!

03:34.081 --> 03:35.283
I'll nail her on her home turf.

03:35.316 --> 03:37.485
Nah, you're not
nailing nobody.

03:37.518 --> 03:38.586
What happened?

03:38.619 --> 03:40.454
This is according to
Cheryl Brewer, who's

03:40.488 --> 03:43.357
older sister not only
goes to Lanford High,

03:43.391 --> 03:45.459
but is also on the
student council

03:45.493 --> 03:48.829
and had a ringside seat for
the event of the century.

03:48.862 --> 03:51.965
Get to the point, Edna.

03:51.999 --> 03:55.936
Well, just as she
completes the line,

03:55.969 --> 03:59.640
"I'd like to thank the student
council for allowing me

03:59.673 --> 04:02.009
to speak my mind," it happened.

04:02.042 --> 04:03.611
What happened?

04:03.644 --> 04:05.613
Becky cut the cheese.

04:13.987 --> 04:18.191
Tell us about this stud we're
going to be meeting tonight.

04:18.225 --> 04:20.428
Mother, you're not
going to meet him.

04:20.461 --> 04:21.995
Well, we're going to
be at the bowling alley

04:22.029 --> 04:27.935
and Chip's going to be
at the bowling alley.

04:27.968 --> 04:30.037
We're bound to run
into one another.

04:33.707 --> 04:37.578
Please don't
embarrass me, please.

04:37.611 --> 04:40.247
Oh, honey, there's no
way we'd embarrass you.

04:46.186 --> 04:47.588
Mom?

04:47.621 --> 04:48.656
Yeah?

04:48.689 --> 04:50.324
If you want it, I
still have some birthday

04:50.358 --> 04:52.760
money I hid in my closet.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.495
Oh, no you don't.

04:54.528 --> 04:55.396
But thanks, anyway.

04:58.165 --> 05:02.536
Well, I was
thinking, you know,

05:02.570 --> 05:09.577
just in case we decide
to, that it's time for me

05:09.610 --> 05:13.313
to get some birth control.

05:33.000 --> 05:38.338
Isn't it great, Roseanne,
that Becky has such

05:38.372 --> 05:42.510
a wonderful, progressive,
open minded mom that she

05:42.543 --> 05:44.077
can talk to about that?

05:49.617 --> 05:50.518
Oh, sure!

05:53.220 --> 05:55.456
Darlene, you can't just
sit there and be kissed.

05:55.489 --> 05:57.525
You got to kiss back.

05:57.558 --> 05:59.059
Or you can be the one
doing the kissing,

05:59.092 --> 06:00.293
but boys don't like that.

06:00.327 --> 06:01.194
How come?

06:01.228 --> 06:02.396
I don't know.

06:02.430 --> 06:04.364
It's like they think it's
their job or something.

06:04.398 --> 06:05.999
Well, how do you
know when to breathe?

06:06.033 --> 06:07.535
You can breathe
whenever you feel like it.

06:07.568 --> 06:08.802
So basically you just do this?

06:13.507 --> 06:14.542
No, no, no, no.

06:14.575 --> 06:15.375
No, you kind of--

06:21.982 --> 06:23.517
Then you open your
mouth a little bit.

06:23.551 --> 06:27.087
You open your mouth?

06:27.120 --> 06:29.490
For what?

06:29.523 --> 06:31.859
So you can slip
them the tongue.

06:35.829 --> 06:37.731
Oh, my.

06:37.765 --> 06:42.169
I'm glad I don't stay up past 9.

06:42.202 --> 06:44.972
We moved on up to get
away from people like you.

06:52.746 --> 06:56.116
You're supposed to teach
your children valuable lessons.

06:56.149 --> 06:59.019
Do you have an episode
where your son breaks

06:59.052 --> 07:01.755
a window with a baseball and
your husband makes him go out

07:01.789 --> 07:04.224
and get a job and pay for it?

07:04.257 --> 07:05.392
Well, no.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.194
We couldn't do an episode
like that, you know?

07:07.227 --> 07:08.328
The network doesn't like it.

07:08.361 --> 07:09.697
Too risky.

07:09.730 --> 07:13.233
But we did have this one show
that the network just loved.

07:13.266 --> 07:17.505
It was about me finding some
old reefer down in the basement.

07:17.538 --> 07:18.338
Reefer?

07:21.709 --> 07:23.343
Ask Eddie Haskell.

07:23.376 --> 07:25.178
So anyway, so I thought
it was David's-- you know,

07:25.212 --> 07:28.015
that's the guy that's
sleeping with my daughter--

07:28.048 --> 07:30.818
but anyway, it turns out
that it was my old pot.

07:30.851 --> 07:32.419
So we started
smoking it, you know?

07:36.456 --> 07:37.324
Roseanne?

07:37.357 --> 07:38.626
Hmm.

07:38.659 --> 07:45.599
You are the most wonderful,
beautiful, sexy, you know,

07:45.633 --> 07:46.433
thing.

07:50.237 --> 07:52.239
I really, really love you.

07:55.843 --> 07:56.644
What?

08:03.083 --> 08:05.385
I thought this stuff
would make me feel younger.

08:05.418 --> 08:08.589
All I feel is old
and tired and hungry.

08:08.622 --> 08:10.290
Man.

08:10.323 --> 08:12.359
Maybe this is how we got fat.

08:17.565 --> 08:18.431
JACKIE: Nobody loves me.

08:30.377 --> 08:31.812
Oh, hi, Jackie!

08:31.845 --> 08:33.180
We thought you went home.

08:33.213 --> 08:36.283
Look at me, I got nothing.

08:36.316 --> 08:38.285
No boyfriend, no
meaningful job, no husband,

08:38.318 --> 08:41.121
no family, it's just me.

08:41.154 --> 08:42.189
It's just me and my ganja.

08:56.136 --> 08:57.170
[loud thud]

08:57.204 --> 08:59.707
Did you hear that?

08:59.740 --> 09:02.109
Sound like somebody is coming
through the front door.

09:02.142 --> 09:03.611
You tease me.

09:03.644 --> 09:06.647
I'm paranoid, Dan.

09:06.680 --> 09:10.117
Ooh, birds, birds, birds!

09:10.150 --> 09:11.985
Don't you hate that
when you're stoned?

09:12.019 --> 09:12.953
I don't like it any time!

09:17.991 --> 09:19.059
[loud thud]

09:19.092 --> 09:22.262
Now, don't tell me
you didn't hear that.

09:22.295 --> 09:23.731
Is this the sink?

09:23.764 --> 09:24.865
Am I shrinking?

09:30.904 --> 09:32.372
[knock on door]

09:32.405 --> 09:34.842
DJ: Mom?

09:34.875 --> 09:36.744
The jig is up!

09:38.345 --> 09:53.093
DJ DJ DJ DJ DJ Did you ever
notice how weird that sounds?

09:53.126 --> 09:54.061
DJ

09:54.094 --> 09:55.028
Shh!

09:55.062 --> 09:55.963
Dan, maintain.

10:07.307 --> 10:10.711
(SHRILLY) What
do you want, DJ?

10:10.744 --> 10:13.180
God, you're right.

10:13.213 --> 10:15.115
DJ: I forgot my sleeping bag.

10:15.148 --> 10:18.118
Where is it?

10:18.151 --> 10:20.520
(SHRILLY) Oh, well, it
is out behind the house.

10:20.553 --> 10:21.889
Past the yard.

10:21.922 --> 10:25.525
You know, in that building back
there where your dad always

10:25.558 --> 10:29.562
is with the tools and a car?

10:29.596 --> 10:30.497
DJ: Thanks, mom!

10:36.069 --> 10:38.305
Oh my god, I'm
like the worst mother

10:38.338 --> 10:39.306
on the face of the earth.

10:39.339 --> 10:42.175
- No you're not.
- Yes I am, Dan.

10:42.209 --> 10:43.777
I don't even know
where I sent my kid.

10:47.080 --> 10:49.783
Well, say he falls
down, you know,

10:49.817 --> 10:52.552
and he breaks one of his organs
and he needs a transplant

10:52.585 --> 10:54.755
from me, you know, but I can't
give him any of my organs

10:54.788 --> 10:56.990
because they're all full of pot.

11:00.593 --> 11:03.296
That's not going
to happen, honey.

11:03.330 --> 11:04.664
I just know.

11:04.698 --> 11:09.236
There's just no way I could
handle any kind of crisis, Dan.

11:09.269 --> 11:13.506
Well, maybe I could.

11:13.540 --> 11:17.610
Oh god, I just want
our normal lives back.

11:17.644 --> 11:21.414
Were we ever really
stupid enough to enjoy this?

11:21.448 --> 11:23.250
Yes we were, Dan.

11:23.283 --> 11:26.286
But you know, that was
a very different time.

11:26.319 --> 11:28.521
There was there
was a war going on.

11:28.555 --> 11:30.123
Everything was just
a lot more fun.

11:32.993 --> 11:35.462
Could someone please
get me a cold towel?

11:38.631 --> 11:40.968
Oh come on, we
learned our lesson.

11:41.001 --> 11:42.803
We got the message across.

11:42.836 --> 11:45.839
Drugs are bad, especially
really old stuff that's

11:45.873 --> 11:48.275
been sitting there for awhile.

11:48.308 --> 11:52.545
But that's the wrong
image for a TV mom.

11:52.579 --> 11:53.914
She's right, you know.

11:53.947 --> 11:58.285
Once Timmy went off to
explore an old, abandoned mine

11:58.318 --> 12:00.553
after I had told him not to.

12:00.587 --> 12:04.091
My husband gave him
a good talking to.

12:04.124 --> 12:06.593
Well, see, now that is
the difference between us.

12:06.626 --> 12:09.662
In my house I yell
at the kids and Dan

12:09.696 --> 12:13.733
is the one whose job it is to
just sit there looking pretty.

12:13.767 --> 12:16.703
You mean, you're the
boss in your own family?

12:16.736 --> 12:17.905
Yep.

12:17.938 --> 12:21.141
And I get all the
good jokes, too.

12:21.174 --> 12:22.910
Pretty sweet, ain't it?

12:22.943 --> 12:25.478
On my show the dog
got all the good lines.

12:29.549 --> 12:31.251
I just translated.

12:31.284 --> 12:34.154
And then they shot me
off into outer space

12:34.187 --> 12:38.959
and I had that annoying Dr.
Smith and that damned robot.

12:38.992 --> 12:40.994
Well, see, nobody upstages me.

12:41.028 --> 12:44.397
That's why they call
the show "Roseanne."

12:44.431 --> 12:47.034
They named the show after you?

12:47.067 --> 12:48.301
The wife?

12:48.335 --> 12:51.238
I didn't know they
could do that.

12:51.271 --> 12:57.710
Now those bastards
told me that there

12:57.744 --> 13:02.315
were too many letters in
June to be on the screen.

13:02.349 --> 13:03.984
(VOICEOVER) It
was at that moment

13:04.017 --> 13:06.686
I realized I had
been ripped off.

13:06.719 --> 13:09.256
I should have been
the star of my show.

13:09.289 --> 13:10.924
I should have had
the voice-overs.

13:13.894 --> 13:15.863
I still don't like it.

13:15.896 --> 13:19.799
You know, in my day mothers
did not have tattoos.

13:19.833 --> 13:24.771
Yeah, well you obviously
never saw Harriet Nelson naked.

13:24.804 --> 13:28.575
Anyways, the important thing
is on my show I'm the boss

13:28.608 --> 13:32.012
and father knows squat.

13:32.045 --> 13:34.547
All right, I'll stay.

13:34.581 --> 13:37.050
Oh, poor Dan.

13:37.084 --> 13:39.987
He has to sit here on the
bed with me for two minutes

13:40.020 --> 13:45.125
and do nothing while me
and God create a life.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.526
Maybe my sperms
are just waiting

13:46.559 --> 13:47.594
for your egg to shut up.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.532
Oh Dan, I know
that we're both just

13:52.565 --> 13:54.734
sick to death of all
this lovemaking crap,

13:54.767 --> 13:56.904
but we've got to do it.

13:56.937 --> 13:58.038
You know, I've been thinking.

13:58.071 --> 14:01.041
When this kid graduates
high school I'll be 60.

14:01.074 --> 14:02.175
Well, it's one
of our kids, Dan,

14:02.209 --> 14:04.211
so you'll probably be
more like 65 or 70.

14:07.614 --> 14:10.483
I'll be too old even
to play ball with him.

14:10.517 --> 14:12.452
Odds are half my
life's over already.

14:12.485 --> 14:14.587
If this kid has to grow
up without a father,

14:14.621 --> 14:16.924
is that fair to him?

14:16.957 --> 14:18.125
I'm scared, Roseanne.

14:18.158 --> 14:20.293
This whole thing is making
me think about death.

14:20.327 --> 14:21.995
Well, think about
whatever you have to, Dan.

14:22.029 --> 14:23.196
We're going again in 20 minutes.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.535
Wake up, sleepyhead.

14:28.568 --> 14:29.436
Dan?

14:29.469 --> 14:30.437
Hi, honey.

14:30.470 --> 14:31.738
How do you feel?

14:31.771 --> 14:33.406
How did everything go?

14:33.440 --> 14:35.175
Oh, the operation went great.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.344
The surgeon said it
was his best work ever.

14:37.377 --> 14:38.245
I want to see.

14:38.278 --> 14:39.446
I want to see.

14:39.479 --> 14:40.380
OK.

14:40.413 --> 14:41.949
There's a mirror
over by the wall.

14:41.982 --> 14:42.882
Let me help you up.

14:50.423 --> 14:51.824
[screaming]

14:53.893 --> 14:55.362
Great, huh?

14:55.395 --> 14:59.832
They were supposed
to make them smaller!

14:59.866 --> 15:02.835
This is better!

15:02.869 --> 15:06.539
Oh my God!

15:06.573 --> 15:07.874
You know, come on, Dan.

15:07.907 --> 15:10.377
It's been, like, a while.

15:10.410 --> 15:11.211
I know.

15:14.047 --> 15:16.716
What's the matter?

15:16.749 --> 15:19.586
I'm not sure this
is the right time.

15:19.619 --> 15:20.487
No, no.

15:20.520 --> 15:21.521
It's the perfect time.

15:21.554 --> 15:22.855
I haven't even made the bed yet.

15:25.792 --> 15:27.927
I don't know, Roseanne,
I feel kind of weird.

15:27.961 --> 15:29.396
Well it's still me.

15:32.265 --> 15:34.767
I'm nervous, hon.

15:34.801 --> 15:36.203
Well, don't be.

15:45.712 --> 15:46.679
They're higher now.

15:50.750 --> 15:54.154
Look, it's not that we think
anything is wrong with nudity.

15:54.187 --> 15:56.990
As a matter of fact,
me and Mr. Connor

15:57.024 --> 15:59.192
used to have sex that way.

15:59.226 --> 16:01.761
I feel sorry for you people.

16:01.794 --> 16:04.431
Nudity is our chosen lifestyle.

16:04.464 --> 16:07.967
But you can't help yourselves.

16:08.001 --> 16:11.004
You're compulsive,
sick perverts.

16:14.074 --> 16:17.777
Well it's not that
easy not to look.

16:17.810 --> 16:20.547
Well, I certainly
think we could manage.

16:20.580 --> 16:23.250
Oh yeah?
What color are my eyes?

16:23.283 --> 16:25.685
Oh my god!

16:25.718 --> 16:29.156
Come on, dear!

16:29.189 --> 16:32.492
We're going to plant
that hedge, believe me.

16:32.525 --> 16:34.927
And we'll tell all
your neighbors just

16:34.961 --> 16:37.464
what kind of people you are.

16:37.497 --> 16:39.132
Well, it's too late.

16:39.166 --> 16:40.600
They already know.

16:43.570 --> 16:46.906
Honest to god, this
broad was so hot I thought

16:46.939 --> 16:48.608
that she was going to kill me.

16:48.641 --> 16:50.577
Oh, man.

16:50.610 --> 16:52.245
Yeah, bada bing, bada boom.

16:55.315 --> 16:59.586
So then she brings out this
suitcase full of sex toys,

16:59.619 --> 17:01.221
and I'm thinking
this broad is freaky.

17:01.254 --> 17:02.389
Oh, yeah.

17:02.422 --> 17:03.923
As long as you're getting
your battery charged

17:03.956 --> 17:05.792
what's the damn difference?

17:05.825 --> 17:07.094
Yeah.

17:07.127 --> 17:08.861
I mean, while you're getting
your car washed you might

17:08.895 --> 17:12.599
as well get the hot wax, right?

17:12.632 --> 17:13.633
Yeah.

17:13.666 --> 17:15.001
One thing I want to
know is what does

17:15.034 --> 17:17.370
she want with you when she's
got a suitcase full of sex toys?

17:21.007 --> 17:23.410
Is that supposed to be a joke?

17:23.443 --> 17:24.244
OK.

17:41.394 --> 17:43.830
[man groans]

17:43.863 --> 17:45.732
[roseanne groans]

17:50.737 --> 17:53.673
So, how you doing?

17:53.706 --> 17:55.142
Fine.

17:55.175 --> 17:59.912
You watch that
Blackhawks game on TV?

17:59.946 --> 18:01.080
Nope.

18:01.114 --> 18:03.716
Oh, you're a Bulls fan, eh?

18:09.922 --> 18:11.191
Oh, I get it.

18:11.224 --> 18:13.059
It's like being in an elevator.

18:16.429 --> 18:18.731
You know, Roseanne, we
ought to hang out more often.

18:18.765 --> 18:19.832
I was thinking that, too.

18:19.866 --> 18:24.571
But next time let's
leave the wives at home.

18:24.604 --> 18:28.575
You read my mind.

18:28.608 --> 18:29.409
Huh?

18:51.164 --> 18:53.866
Oh come on, Barbara.

18:53.900 --> 18:55.568
Wasn't that fun?

18:55.602 --> 18:56.769
Yeah.

18:56.803 --> 18:58.104
You know, maybe if you
would have spoke your mind

18:58.137 --> 18:59.339
once in a while
Beav wouldn't have

18:59.372 --> 19:02.442
had to go get killed in 'Nam.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.477
Oh, that was just a rumor.

19:04.511 --> 19:06.145
Beaver's alive.

19:06.179 --> 19:08.515
Yeah, well, he ain't working.

19:08.548 --> 19:11.318
I don't like any of this.

19:11.351 --> 19:17.457
Like girls kissing girls and
foul language and teenage sex.

19:17.490 --> 19:20.593
Yeah, I know that
stuff's kind of bad.

19:20.627 --> 19:23.196
But you guys want to hear
how much money I make?

19:26.766 --> 19:30.203
[women exclaiming]

19:30.237 --> 19:32.205
Oh my god!

19:32.239 --> 19:34.941
Why, I'd make out with a
chick for that kind of dough.

19:41.448 --> 19:43.283
Any one of you.

19:43.316 --> 19:45.918
Right now.

19:45.952 --> 19:47.654
All right, well,
come on, ladies.

19:47.687 --> 19:49.422
Let's go toss back a few
and raise a little hell.

19:49.456 --> 19:51.524
Give them something to make
a movie of the week about.

19:51.558 --> 19:53.926
I'll call that
Partridge girl and she

19:53.960 --> 19:55.595
can pick us up on her bus.

19:55.628 --> 19:56.829
Ah, screw that.

19:56.863 --> 19:57.997
We'll take my limo.

19:58.030 --> 19:58.965
You have a limo?

19:58.998 --> 19:59.999
Yeah.

20:00.032 --> 20:01.901
Yeah, and look what
my driver gave me.

20:14.547 --> 20:16.583
There's nothing
wrong with my driving.

20:16.616 --> 20:17.484
Uh-huh.

20:17.517 --> 20:18.885
Right.

20:18.918 --> 20:21.954
That's why you throw me all over
the car pumping those brakes.

20:21.988 --> 20:25.191
I pump the brakes to
make sure they grab.

20:25.224 --> 20:28.461
Because if they don't
grab I rear end the guy

20:28.495 --> 20:29.896
in front of me, I get a ticket.

20:29.929 --> 20:31.264
They raise our
insurance premiums,

20:31.298 --> 20:32.732
we go broke trying to pay them.

20:32.765 --> 20:35.201
We end up in the poor horse--

20:35.234 --> 20:38.671
[neighs] Wilbur!

20:38.705 --> 20:41.741
We end up at the poor
house, our children starve.

20:41.774 --> 20:45.378
I pump those brakes to
make sure they grab.

20:45.412 --> 20:48.448
If the don't grab I rear
end the guy in front of me,

20:48.481 --> 20:49.682
I get a ticket.

20:49.716 --> 20:51.751
Our insurance premiums go up.

20:51.784 --> 20:53.553
We go broke trying to pay them.

20:53.586 --> 20:55.422
Our children end
up in a poor house.

20:55.455 --> 20:56.523
We starve.

20:56.556 --> 20:58.591
That's why I pump the brakes.

20:58.625 --> 21:00.293
OK, well just
tell me one thing.

21:00.327 --> 21:01.193
What?

21:01.227 --> 21:03.930
Why do you pump the brakes?

21:03.963 --> 21:07.266
[laughter]

21:09.802 --> 21:10.970
You know, Rosie.

21:13.773 --> 21:17.310
[music playing]
