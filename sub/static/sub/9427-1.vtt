00:30.364 --> 00:33.566
Welcome back to
the Greenpatch Cricket Ground.

00:33.568 --> 00:36.435
Yes, Rich. A few
dark clouds around earlier on.

00:36.437 --> 00:37.937
But thankfully,
they've passed.

00:37.939 --> 00:40.773
Well, what a thrilling test 
this is turning out to be, Tony!

00:40.775 --> 00:43.943
Eight hours of play
and not a single run scored!

00:43.945 --> 00:45.611
You could cut the tension with your beak!

00:45.613 --> 00:48.514
If this was any more absorbing, Rich,
it'd be a tea-towel!

00:53.688 --> 00:55.187
Yes,
he's giving him the eye,

00:55.189 --> 00:57.189
and he's giving him
the finger too!

00:57.191 --> 01:00.426
Well, this could be trouble.
He's going back for the long run-up.

01:00.428 --> 01:01.827
Yes, well,
aren't these players

01:01.829 --> 01:03.929
looking delicious out there
this afternoon, Rich?

01:03.931 --> 01:05.698
Yes, they certainly
are, Tony!

01:05.700 --> 01:07.433
I'd lick my lips
if I had any.

01:07.435 --> 01:11.237
Tommo steaming in hard and
fast now from the Billabong end.

01:11.239 --> 01:13.906
Well, that's a marvelous
shot indeed!

01:13.908 --> 01:16.842
Yes he's got under that one
and really given it some stick!

01:16.844 --> 01:18.644
That's a knockout!

01:18.646 --> 01:20.146
That's just not cricket.

01:21.783 --> 01:24.316
Hyah! Got Him!
Ha-ha! Howzat!

01:24.318 --> 01:28.387
<i>That deadset legend</i>
<i>is my dad, Bill Koala!</i>

01:28.389 --> 01:30.022
<i>Yeah, maybe</i>
<i>you've heard of him.</i>

01:30.024 --> 01:34.026
<i>He's, paws-down,</i>
<i>the best explorer in the whole outback.</i>

01:34.028 --> 01:37.129
<i>But of all the places he's ever been,</i>
<i>he reckons our home,</i>

01:37.131 --> 01:39.832
<i>Greenpatch, is the best.</i>
Hi, fellas! Nice!

01:39.834 --> 01:42.401
<i>In Greenpatch,</i>
<i>everyone's welcome.</i>

01:42.403 --> 01:44.003
Hi, Bill!

01:44.005 --> 01:45.971
<i>Furry. Feathered.</i>
<i>Two legs. Four legs.</i>

01:45.973 --> 01:51.944
<i>Even fun-spoiling,</i>
<i>snot-sucking goannas like old Crankypants.</i>

01:51.946 --> 01:54.547
<i>But dad keeps him in check.</i>

01:59.487 --> 02:02.188
<i>My dad's always going out</i>
<i>into the Great Desert</i>

02:02.190 --> 02:04.824
<i>to rescue lost</i>
<i>and injured animals.</i>

02:04.826 --> 02:06.292
<i>He's a real hero.</i>

02:06.294 --> 02:07.726
Here you go, Bill.
Cheers, love.

02:07.728 --> 02:09.094
<i>Kind of a bit like me!</i>

02:09.096 --> 02:11.397
Son! Getcha fluffy
little butt down here!

02:11.399 --> 02:14.667
I'm heading off.
Coming! Wha... Ouch!

02:14.669 --> 02:16.802
Oh! Just a sec!

02:16.804 --> 02:20.105
Here I am!

02:20.107 --> 02:22.775
Ready when you are, Dad.

02:22.777 --> 02:25.377
Where are we going?
Erm, right.

02:25.379 --> 02:27.379
Your boof-head father's
got it in his head

02:27.381 --> 02:29.815
that the Sea of White Dragons
really exists.

02:29.817 --> 02:32.051
The Sea of White Dragons?

02:32.053 --> 02:34.453
Whoa, Dad,
can I come with you?

02:34.455 --> 02:37.890
I...
Steady on, champ.

02:37.892 --> 02:40.826
I've got this
trip covered.

02:40.828 --> 02:43.329
The desert's not
Greenpatch, mate.

02:43.331 --> 02:48.734
It's a wild, rugged land
full of mystery and danger.

02:48.736 --> 02:51.637
It's no place
for a little koala.

02:51.639 --> 02:52.905
When you're bigger, aye?

02:52.907 --> 02:55.708
But I am big!
And strong. Look.

02:57.278 --> 03:00.012
And I hardly ever
fall over anymore.

03:00.014 --> 03:02.448
Except just then.
Stupid grass!

03:02.450 --> 03:04.783
This is called
the Koala Flyer.

03:04.785 --> 03:08.721
I made it to help us explore.
Whoa! It's like you say,

03:08.723 --> 03:11.290
"The higher you go,
the further you see."

03:11.292 --> 03:13.659
It's great, mate.

03:13.661 --> 03:16.762
But, you know,
koalas can't fly.

03:19.166 --> 03:21.433
We can work on your kite
while your dad's away.

03:21.435 --> 03:24.470
Cheer up, cheeky chops.

03:24.472 --> 03:26.805
What do us
adventurers always say?

03:26.807 --> 03:29.408
Don't drink
the yellow water?

03:29.410 --> 03:30.776
Yeah, the other thing.

03:31.879 --> 03:34.446
An adventurer
never gives up.

03:34.448 --> 03:36.749
An adventurer always
helps those in need.

03:36.751 --> 03:37.983
And?

03:37.985 --> 03:39.218
Always...

03:39.220 --> 03:40.653
Keeps his promise!

03:40.655 --> 03:42.054
Too right!

03:42.056 --> 03:46.759
I promise that one day
I'll take you on an adventure.

03:46.761 --> 03:49.662
If you promise to look after
your mum while I'm gone.

03:51.065 --> 03:53.465
And you promise
not to get yourself eaten.

03:53.467 --> 03:55.067
I'll be right, Betty.

03:55.069 --> 03:58.537
You know me.
Yes.

03:58.539 --> 04:00.105
I do know you.

04:00.107 --> 04:01.740
Paws in!

04:03.577 --> 04:05.311
Paws in!

04:11.886 --> 04:13.953
See ya, mate

04:13.955 --> 04:16.522
I'll be back in two shakes
of a bilby's whisker.

04:18.959 --> 04:21.093
<i>But he wasn't.</i>

04:21.095 --> 04:22.795
<i>It's been a year</i>
<i>since he left.</i>

04:24.231 --> 04:25.664
<i>I wish he'd hurry up.</i>

04:26.934 --> 04:29.501
<i>Without dad around,</i>
<i>Cranky's gone troppo.</i>

04:31.205 --> 04:32.604
<i>Thinks he owns the place.</i>

04:32.606 --> 04:34.306
Did I say "stop"?

04:37.578 --> 04:42.047
<i>When my dad gets back,</i>
<i>he's gonna kick his scaly butt.</i>

04:42.049 --> 04:44.550
But right now,
he's out exploring,

04:44.552 --> 04:47.619
the Sea of White Dragons.

04:47.621 --> 04:51.023
Probably surrounded by a million hungry tooth monsters.

04:51.025 --> 04:54.093
Takin' em down to
Koala Town one by one.

04:54.095 --> 04:57.062
Here comes the big one!

05:01.035 --> 05:03.535
Robert, stop doing that!
What?

05:03.537 --> 05:06.638
Kangaroos hop,
lyre birds mimic! Deal with it.

05:07.942 --> 05:10.409
Birds!
Splodge, fruit bombs.

05:18.953 --> 05:20.753
Er, thanks.

05:21.722 --> 05:25.190
Operation Goanna Splat is, go!

05:25.192 --> 05:26.658
Hey, kids.
I'm heading out.

05:28.429 --> 05:32.431
Did I hear something
about goannas?

05:32.433 --> 05:34.867
Er, yeah.

05:34.869 --> 05:37.503
I was saying we should
go-anna get some lunch.

05:37.505 --> 05:40.272
Blinky, let me
worry about Cranklepot.

05:40.908 --> 05:43.475
Please. Be good.

05:43.477 --> 05:46.311
'Course, Mum.
I'm always good. Huh?

05:46.313 --> 05:48.781
Blinky...
I promise.

05:53.654 --> 05:56.121
Come on. Cranky's speech
is about to start.

05:56.123 --> 05:58.757
Yeah... Whoa!
Didn't you just promise to be good?

05:58.759 --> 06:01.827
Good?
I'm gonna be great!

06:09.003 --> 06:11.136
Comin' through!

06:15.643 --> 06:17.242
Robert!
Code red!

06:17.244 --> 06:18.343
On it, Blinky!

06:22.116 --> 06:23.515
Marcia! Wind check!

06:23.517 --> 06:25.651
She's slow
and steady, Blinky.

06:25.653 --> 06:26.852
Perfect day to fly a kite.

06:26.854 --> 06:29.088
And rain
on Cranky's parade!

06:32.026 --> 06:34.293
And you really
are sure about this, Blinky?

06:34.295 --> 06:35.928
Yep,
It says "No climbing!"

06:35.930 --> 06:38.230
Dad says an adventurer
makes his own rules.

06:38.232 --> 06:39.932
But, what if your
kite crashes?

06:39.934 --> 06:42.167
Yeah. Like all the others.

06:42.169 --> 06:45.504
Yeah! It's gonna go...

06:46.373 --> 06:47.473
Your brains will...

06:50.845 --> 06:52.111
And then your mum
will start...

06:53.380 --> 06:54.813
Yeah, thanks, Robert!

06:54.815 --> 06:57.516
Trust me,
there's nothing to worry about.

07:00.087 --> 07:02.955
I'll show them,
this kite will fly.

07:02.957 --> 07:04.223
Ooh.

07:04.225 --> 07:06.692
Just like you one day.

07:17.271 --> 07:19.638
My fellow
Greenpatchians!

07:19.640 --> 07:23.709
Have no fear,
Cranklepot's here!

07:27.481 --> 07:30.482
Where was I? Oh, yes.

07:30.484 --> 07:35.521
We're all gathered here to honor me,
your most beloved lizard.

07:46.066 --> 07:47.499
Whoa!

07:57.645 --> 07:59.611
Just a humble reptile.

08:00.814 --> 08:03.081
I hope you like fruit,
Crankypants!

08:03.083 --> 08:05.751
In your face!

08:05.753 --> 08:08.987
Whoa! Change of plan!

08:08.989 --> 08:10.522
Sure thing, Blinky!

08:10.524 --> 08:12.558
What's the new pla...

08:12.560 --> 08:18.363
Today marks one year since the
so-called founder of Greenpatch,

08:18.365 --> 08:21.867
the traitorous
Bill Koala abandoned us

08:21.869 --> 08:25.537
like a cowardly
little vegetarian!

08:25.539 --> 08:28.907
Pull your snout in,
Wilberforce Cranklepot!

08:28.909 --> 08:32.510
My husband didn't
abandon anyone.

08:32.513 --> 08:37.582
He went out into the Great Desert to save lost animals!

08:37.585 --> 08:40.284
Oh, really?
And where is he now?

08:40.287 --> 08:43.822
I'll tell you where he is,
he's dead.

08:43.823 --> 08:46.258
He's an ex-koala.

08:47.494 --> 08:49.161
Beware, I say!

08:49.163 --> 08:54.233
The saber-toothed dingo-dogs and
flying fang serpents are coming!

08:54.235 --> 08:57.502
What? Don't listen to him!
He's making it up!

08:57.504 --> 09:00.639
Closing our borders to the
foreign menace is our only hope!

09:00.641 --> 09:03.575
Don't you dare!
Greenpatch is a refuge for all animals!

09:03.577 --> 09:05.844
Pah! Bleeding-hearted
jibber-jabber!

09:05.846 --> 09:08.814
I'll give you jibber-jabber,
you walking handbag!

09:08.816 --> 09:11.717
It's a cold-blooded
world out there, Mrs. Bill.

09:11.719 --> 09:14.953
And it's time we all embraced our inner reptile.

09:14.955 --> 09:19.191
Which is why I, your new leader,
King Wilberforce Cranklepot,

09:19.193 --> 09:23.562
henceforth rename
Greenpatch, Goannasburg.

09:23.564 --> 09:26.598
What?
Behold the Statue of Lizardy!

09:31.872 --> 09:33.272
Crikey!

09:33.274 --> 09:36.975
Striking, isn't he?
I carved him myself...

09:38.646 --> 09:41.213
Take that, termite breath!

09:41.215 --> 09:44.349
Whoa!

09:44.351 --> 09:46.685
Whoo-hoo! Incoming!
This is not a drill!

09:48.022 --> 09:50.622
That's a drill!

09:50.624 --> 09:52.991
I'm flying!

09:52.993 --> 09:55.060
Whoa! I'm falling!

09:58.999 --> 10:00.766
Blinky!

10:00.768 --> 10:01.933
Marcia!
What?

10:02.536 --> 10:03.802
Marcia!

10:06.674 --> 10:10.442
What have you
done, Koala? My statue!

10:14.381 --> 10:17.382
Marcia, are you okay?
No!

10:17.384 --> 10:19.918
You know I can't stand
paddy melon juice.

10:22.122 --> 10:25.724
Blinky Bill!

10:25.726 --> 10:28.627
This was my favorite shirt!
Typical Blinky.

10:28.629 --> 10:33.298
See? This is what happens
when someone breaks my rules.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.534
Everyone suffers.

10:38.138 --> 10:41.273
Time to teach you
a lesson, tree-rat.

10:43.510 --> 10:44.843
Have to catch me first!

10:44.845 --> 10:47.045
You malignant marsupial!

10:49.683 --> 10:52.951
The border swamp
is out of bounds!

10:52.953 --> 10:55.387
My dad says
adventure has no bounds!

10:55.389 --> 10:57.522
Stop, fluff ball!

10:58.392 --> 10:59.725
Insolent!

11:01.862 --> 11:03.695
I'm warning you!

11:03.697 --> 11:05.764
Leaving Greenpatch
is forbidden!

11:05.766 --> 11:07.399
Forbid this!

11:09.670 --> 11:11.903
In your snout, Cranky!

11:11.905 --> 11:14.606
I am the king
of Goannasburg!

11:14.608 --> 11:16.708
There's no such place
as Goannasburg.

11:16.710 --> 11:20.445
My dad discovered this valley
and he named it Greenpatch!

11:20.447 --> 11:24.282
But your dad's not here
anymore, is he?

11:27.054 --> 11:29.588
What's so funny?

11:29.590 --> 11:33.024
The look on your face,
in about three seconds.

11:33.026 --> 11:36.661
Three, two, one.
Uh-oh. Huh?

12:12.132 --> 12:13.432
Whoa!

12:20.474 --> 12:21.673
Oh!

12:22.443 --> 12:23.942
You're a keeper.

12:27.247 --> 12:28.447
Dad?

12:29.550 --> 12:31.216
So this is
where you went.

12:31.218 --> 12:34.219
Gotcha!
Let me go!

12:34.221 --> 12:38.557
It's a disgrace! As your king,
I demand punishment forthwith!

12:38.559 --> 12:41.259
Cranky, you are not the king.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.595
You're just
a jumped-up skink...

12:43.597 --> 12:45.497
Yeah, with
termite breath. Ouch!

12:45.499 --> 12:50.435
Tell it to the claw, Koalas.
The whole town's behind me now,

12:50.437 --> 12:53.472
thanks to your
little stunt.

12:53.474 --> 12:58.944
First thing tomorrow,
I'm sealing up Goannasburg from the outside world.

12:58.946 --> 13:02.514
And then...

13:02.516 --> 13:05.884
I'm turning this tree
into my castle.

13:05.886 --> 13:08.286
You just try it,
you stupid ant-licker!

13:09.356 --> 13:11.189
Blinky!
Where are your manners?

13:11.191 --> 13:14.192
Shut your snout,
you stinking,

13:14.194 --> 13:17.262
scaly, stupid
little ant-licker!

13:19.533 --> 13:21.933
Start packing, Koalas!

13:21.935 --> 13:24.703
I'll be back
and you better be out!

13:24.705 --> 13:26.872
Blinky Bartholomew Bill!

13:26.874 --> 13:30.275
You promised me you'd be good.
Marcia was nearly squished.

13:30.277 --> 13:32.878
I know. She shouldn't
have been standing there.

13:32.880 --> 13:34.613
But now's not the time
for finger-pointing,

13:34.615 --> 13:37.949
we've gotta go save Dad before
Cranky shuts up the valley forever.

13:37.951 --> 13:41.253
Blinky!
Greenpatch needs us here.

13:41.255 --> 13:43.822
If we don't stand up
to Cranky, who will?

13:43.824 --> 13:45.924
Dad will! I know
which way he went,

13:45.926 --> 13:48.793
I saw his marker!
Mum, come on.

13:49.796 --> 13:51.596
Mum?
It's been a year, love.

13:51.598 --> 13:53.498
Exactly!

13:53.500 --> 13:55.033
We have to go to the Sea of
White Dragons and save him!

13:55.035 --> 13:57.802
There's no
such place, Blinky.

13:57.804 --> 13:59.838
There's nothing
out there but desert.

14:00.974 --> 14:02.941
It's just a myth!
But...

14:02.943 --> 14:06.011
What if it's not?
I can't lose you too, Blinky.

14:06.747 --> 14:08.413
I'm sorry.

14:08.415 --> 14:11.583
But I forbid you to go.
That's not fair.

14:11.585 --> 14:14.152
You might have given up on Dad,
but I haven't.

14:15.355 --> 14:18.323
And Dad says
you never give up!

14:18.325 --> 14:19.457
Blinky!

14:19.993 --> 14:21.359
Never give up!

14:38.011 --> 14:40.312
Blinky?
Blinky's not here!

14:40.314 --> 14:44.015
Well, can you give him a message
that his mum loves him?

14:44.017 --> 14:46.284
I'll think about it.

14:57.764 --> 14:58.930
Dad.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.967
I'm not giving up.

15:01.969 --> 15:04.903
If the Sea of White Dragons
really exists,

15:05.639 --> 15:06.805
I'll find you.

15:23.790 --> 15:27.292
Blinky, this is crazy!
You don't even know what's out there!

15:27.294 --> 15:30.028
It's dangerous!
Remember what Cranky said?

15:30.030 --> 15:32.864
That old fossil!
He's just trying to scare us.

15:32.866 --> 15:36.434
And it worked!
What if the flying fanged serpents get you?

15:36.436 --> 15:40.105
Or the toothy beasts
with their slobbery teeth?

15:40.107 --> 15:41.272
It's madness, Blinky!

15:41.274 --> 15:43.808
Come on,
this is where Dad went.

15:45.545 --> 15:46.845
Whoa.

15:46.847 --> 15:48.980
This is amazing!

15:53.520 --> 15:55.387
But Blinky,
what if...

15:55.389 --> 15:56.821
It's okay, Splodge.

15:56.823 --> 15:59.824
As long as we stick to the plan,
everything's gonna be fine.

15:59.826 --> 16:01.259
The plan? What plan?

16:01.261 --> 16:04.596
The plan where you
cover for me, "Blinky".

16:04.598 --> 16:07.766
"Blinky"?
I'm Robe... Oh.

16:07.768 --> 16:09.134
I remember now.

16:09.136 --> 16:12.170
I sure hope this works.
It'll work, trust me.

16:12.172 --> 16:14.072
Mum won't even know
I'm gone.

16:14.074 --> 16:15.840
Paws in.

16:21.581 --> 16:24.816
Operation White Dragons
is, go.

16:24.818 --> 16:27.619
But you're just a little...
Trust me, I'll be fine.

16:27.621 --> 16:29.254
Ooh! Didn't hurt!

16:30.691 --> 16:32.590
See ya later, bush potatoes!
In a while, marsupial.

16:32.592 --> 16:34.025
See ya, Blinky.
Please come back.

16:39.132 --> 16:42.634
I bet ya 100 yams
he's back before lunch.

16:42.636 --> 16:45.403
Guys! I can still hear you!

16:45.405 --> 16:46.538
Sorry, Blinky.

16:46.540 --> 16:48.039
Keep going, mate.

16:49.042 --> 16:50.542
Double or nothing.

16:50.544 --> 16:52.477
Ha! Walk in the park, guys!

16:52.479 --> 16:55.480
Whoa! Missed that one!
Oh, yeah.

16:58.285 --> 17:00.452
Get it off!

17:00.454 --> 17:01.920
Are you okay, Blinky?

17:03.223 --> 17:05.623
Huh? Oh, yeah! Ha-ha!

17:06.093 --> 17:07.559
I...

17:07.560 --> 17:08.727
Think.

17:12.132 --> 17:13.865
Just walking.

17:14.734 --> 17:16.166
It's not creepy.

17:17.237 --> 17:19.137
Not creepy at all.

17:20.674 --> 17:22.941
Not creepy.

17:27.047 --> 17:30.815
<i>¶ Hey, hey, Blinky Bill,</i>
<i>you'll never catch me standing still ¶</i>

17:36.156 --> 17:38.456
Whoa. Yes.

17:41.495 --> 17:42.594
Wow!

17:50.504 --> 17:53.471
Ugh. What animal
did you come out of?

17:59.279 --> 18:00.578
Huh! Water!

18:30.944 --> 18:32.710
The adventure begins.

18:47.661 --> 18:48.927
Oh.

18:52.799 --> 18:54.065
What happened to you?

19:09.282 --> 19:10.481
Oh.

19:24.831 --> 19:26.664
You stupid... Ow!

19:47.921 --> 19:49.954
Hans! Beautiful day.

19:49.956 --> 19:52.724
Sure is.
Let me give you a hand with that, love.

19:52.726 --> 19:55.026
How have you been keeping?
Ah, can't complain.

19:55.028 --> 19:58.062
On my own again today, though.
Gert called in sick again.

19:58.064 --> 19:59.831
All that boy does
is party all night.

20:03.870 --> 20:05.236
Wow.

20:30.163 --> 20:35.500
You know, mother always said it was
rude for me to play with my food.

20:35.502 --> 20:38.503
But I despise my mother.

20:38.505 --> 20:41.940
There's only one thing
I despise more than her.

20:41.942 --> 20:43.775
Can you guess what that is?

20:43.777 --> 20:45.043
Uh-uh.

20:47.447 --> 20:48.713
Koala.

20:50.283 --> 20:54.252
Oh! Good day, little fella!
Yah!

21:46.139 --> 21:48.473
Hot, hot, hot, hot!

22:05.458 --> 22:07.625
Water!

22:07.627 --> 22:09.460
Water, water,
water, water!

22:09.462 --> 22:10.661
I need water!

22:10.663 --> 22:12.196
Water, water,
water, water!

22:24.377 --> 22:25.543
Koala!

22:28.214 --> 22:29.514
Huh?

22:33.520 --> 22:36.254
Are you all right?
Let me help you up.

22:39.893 --> 22:41.659
You're up!

22:41.661 --> 22:44.729
Finally! I shall
have my revenge!

22:44.731 --> 22:47.231
But, but I don't
even know you.

22:47.233 --> 22:50.935
Really?
My sincerest apologies.

22:50.937 --> 22:54.505
Sir Claude.
Purebred British Shorthair.

22:55.708 --> 22:57.508
Eater of small animals.

22:57.510 --> 23:01.079
Tormentor of birds.
And your worst nightmare, Koala.

23:20.600 --> 23:24.235
Lunch is served! Yum!

23:57.971 --> 23:59.837
What's going on here?

24:03.610 --> 24:04.809
You!

24:17.023 --> 24:20.224
I will destroy you, Koala.

24:20.226 --> 24:23.327
If it's the last thing I do.

24:27.400 --> 24:30.568
Whoa!
First time? In a truck?

24:34.207 --> 24:35.873
I guess so.

24:35.875 --> 24:37.241
Whoa!
What?

24:37.977 --> 24:39.377
What're you looking at?

24:39.379 --> 24:42.180
Okay, that's
a little too close.

24:42.182 --> 24:46.317
Personal space! Act cool.
Don't make eye contact.

24:46.319 --> 24:49.887
You're a girl.
Er, last time I looked.

24:49.889 --> 24:52.223
In a cage.
You just say what you see, huh?

24:52.225 --> 24:54.926
How did you get in there?
How'd you get out there?

24:56.763 --> 24:58.763
Wait a second.

24:58.765 --> 25:02.700
That sweaty unwashed smell...
You're wild!

25:03.870 --> 25:07.805
Are you a stowaway?
Whoa. That's so cool.

25:07.807 --> 25:09.907
You had enough
of the great outdoors, huh?

25:09.909 --> 25:12.410
I know this is
all new and strange,

25:12.412 --> 25:15.112
just sit tight and the humans will take care of us.

25:15.114 --> 25:17.548
Whoa!
There's no need to freak out.

25:17.550 --> 25:20.585
Oh, I'm not freaking out.
You kind of look like you're freaking out.

25:20.587 --> 25:22.119
Well, I'm not
freaking out.

25:22.121 --> 25:23.521
Well, good.

25:23.523 --> 25:24.689
Whoa!

25:26.759 --> 25:29.160
Wait here.
Definitely freaking out.

25:35.602 --> 25:38.402
Oh, no! It's gonna
gobble us up!

25:38.404 --> 25:42.373
We've gotta get off this thing!
Ow! Hey! No! What're you doing?

25:42.375 --> 25:44.542
Just stop it! I'm saving you,
it's going to eat us!

25:44.544 --> 25:48.079
What's going to eat us?
Crazy guy back here! Help me!

25:48.081 --> 25:49.347
I am helping you!

25:50.917 --> 25:53.217
You can thank me later,
just hold on!

25:53.219 --> 25:54.986
No, no, no, no!

25:54.988 --> 25:56.787
Don't you dare.

26:04.497 --> 26:06.030
That was some rescue, huh?

26:10.036 --> 26:12.870
Whoa!
What have you done?

26:12.872 --> 26:15.072
They were taking me to my zoo!
Your what?

26:15.074 --> 26:16.173
Wait!

26:16.175 --> 26:17.575
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Wait!

26:17.577 --> 26:20.077
You can't go in there.
It's not safe! You're not safe!

26:20.079 --> 26:22.179
Get off! Stop!

26:22.181 --> 26:24.715
Wait for me!

26:24.717 --> 26:29.086
Oh, she's gonna get eaten!
Okay. Whew. Okay. Whew.

26:29.088 --> 26:31.222
I gotta save her, again.

26:46.105 --> 26:47.204
Oh, no!

26:48.274 --> 26:50.007
No, no, no, no!

26:50.009 --> 26:54.378
This isn't happening.

26:54.380 --> 26:59.016
Happy thoughts.
Deep blue sky. Deep blue sky.

27:00.586 --> 27:02.453
Oh.

27:02.455 --> 27:05.456
It's just a cave
with a hole in it.

27:05.458 --> 27:10.895
Come back! Please!
Don't leave me out here with him!

27:10.897 --> 27:17.101
What is this place?
We are in the middle of nowhere because of you!

27:17.103 --> 27:20.171
Ah!
You know you're pretty strong for a cage.

27:20.173 --> 27:21.972
Koala.

27:28.114 --> 27:31.015
Hey, what's so great
about this zoob anyway?

27:31.017 --> 27:35.319
Zoo, fuzz-nut.
It's just the best place in the world.

27:35.321 --> 27:39.423
Somewhere you definitely
do not need saving from.

27:39.425 --> 27:43.461
We have heated spa baths,
cafes and movie nights,

27:43.463 --> 27:46.864
manicures and
little leafy treats.

27:48.901 --> 27:51.869
Hey! My dad will know
where your zoo is.

27:51.871 --> 27:54.105
I'll take you to him!

27:54.107 --> 27:58.008
Trust me.
He's the best explorer in the outback.

27:58.010 --> 28:01.912
Know who's the second best?
You're looking at him.

28:01.914 --> 28:06.117
The name's Blinky Bill!
I'm pretty legendary around here.

28:06.119 --> 28:07.785
Maybe you've heard of me?
Nope.

28:07.787 --> 28:11.188
Well, trust me. Any trouble comes our way,
I'll give it my famous

28:11.190 --> 28:15.793
whip-kick
to the guts. Hyaaa!

28:17.663 --> 28:19.697
You get the idea.
Yes.

28:19.699 --> 28:23.334
- Yes, I do.
- Paws in?

28:23.336 --> 28:25.936
I promise,
I'll get you to your zoo.

28:27.740 --> 28:29.807
Okay. Deal.

28:30.777 --> 28:34.011
But if you get us lost,
I smash you.

28:34.013 --> 28:37.681
Fine. And if we get eaten,
I smash you.

28:37.683 --> 28:38.816
Okay, okay.

28:38.818 --> 28:40.584
I got it, cagey.
It's Nutsy.

28:40.586 --> 28:42.787
Nutsy? That's your name?

28:42.789 --> 28:45.222
It suits you. Ow!

28:45.224 --> 28:47.658
You make fun of my name...
You smash me?

28:47.660 --> 28:48.926
You're learning.

29:02.575 --> 29:04.975
Knock, knock!
Who's there?

29:04.977 --> 29:06.911
Mum!
Mum who?

29:07.713 --> 29:09.547
Very funny, Blinky.

29:11.117 --> 29:14.652
Oh, er, don't come in.
I'm very naked.

29:14.654 --> 29:17.588
Blinky, it's nothing
I haven't seen before.

29:17.590 --> 29:20.291
Oh, you'd be surprised.
Hey,

29:20.293 --> 29:23.828
I'm going to rally the villagers against Cranky.
I could use your help.

29:23.830 --> 29:25.563
Er, I'd love to, Mum.

29:25.565 --> 29:28.999
But I need to
clean my room.

29:29.001 --> 29:32.236
Hmm? Really?
Are you feeling okay, Blinky?

29:33.439 --> 29:34.572
Coming!

29:35.775 --> 29:36.841
Phew!

29:37.910 --> 29:39.310
Okay! Okay!

29:39.312 --> 29:40.511
Don't get your pouch
in a knot!

29:42.281 --> 29:43.814
Kids!

29:55.127 --> 30:00.030
What kind of a koala's
scared of heights?

30:00.032 --> 30:01.699
A zoo koala!

30:01.701 --> 30:06.036
The tallest thing I've ever climbed
up is a concrete stump, okay?

30:06.038 --> 30:09.573
Sorry! Just making
conversation.

30:13.546 --> 30:16.280
Well, don't!

30:16.282 --> 30:18.616
I know what you're
thinking, anyway!

30:18.618 --> 30:21.418
Zoo koalas can
read minds! Yeah!

30:21.420 --> 30:23.420
Like, right now,
you're thinking...

30:23.422 --> 30:25.489
"Can she really
read my thoughts?"

30:25.491 --> 30:27.324
Hey! How did you kn...

30:31.264 --> 30:34.398
Hmm.
Well, can zoo koalas jump? Huh?

30:34.400 --> 30:36.133
'Cause you're standing
on an ants' nest.

30:36.135 --> 30:40.971
What? Ants! Where? What?
Who? Relax, they're harmless.

30:40.973 --> 30:44.742
Unless they get into your ears and eat out your brains.

30:55.154 --> 30:57.021
Ants don't build nests!

30:57.023 --> 30:59.990
You got a lot
to learn about the wild!

31:01.961 --> 31:05.796
Stupid rock!
Where are we going?

31:06.666 --> 31:07.831
Up!

31:10.303 --> 31:14.038
Dad says the higher you go,
the further you see!

31:14.040 --> 31:15.839
Ergh!
Can someone please tell me

31:15.841 --> 31:19.577
what's so great
about the Great Outdoors?

31:19.579 --> 31:22.212
Seriously,
you've got dirt, ants,

31:22.214 --> 31:24.915
no toilets,
weird little flies.

31:24.917 --> 31:27.484
The things that eat
the weird little flies.

31:27.486 --> 31:28.752
Did I mention dirt?

31:29.989 --> 31:35.225
Relax, cagey.
You've got to trust your wild side.

31:35.227 --> 31:38.562
Right now,
my wild side wants to tear you a new pouch.

31:38.564 --> 31:42.366
Come on, mo-poke. Hey!
Would you just wait?

31:44.837 --> 31:46.236
Wait!

31:50.643 --> 31:51.942
Wow!

32:05.591 --> 32:08.325
Dad never said
the desert was this...

32:08.327 --> 32:11.228
Big.
Whoa! Beep, beep.

32:11.230 --> 32:14.431
Back the truck up.
You've never been in the desert before?

32:14.433 --> 32:16.066
I thought you were wild.

32:16.068 --> 32:20.304
I am wild!
I can run and jump and kick and stuff...

32:20.306 --> 32:22.406
Argh! You're lost!

32:22.408 --> 32:25.709
Admit it! You've got no idea
where your dad is!

32:25.711 --> 32:27.511
Huh?
I've gotta get back to the road.

32:27.513 --> 32:30.447
Wait! No, no, no, no!
I really know where he is!

32:30.449 --> 32:34.018
He's at the
Sea of White Dragons.

32:34.020 --> 32:36.720
What sea?
I don't see a sea.

32:36.722 --> 32:39.757
You're just making this up as we go along!
No.

32:39.759 --> 32:41.792
I promise,
it's a real place.

32:41.794 --> 32:45.462
I can find it. Pah!
You couldn't find your nose with your finger.

32:45.464 --> 32:47.431
Can too! See!

32:50.002 --> 32:52.569
Shh! Wait here.

33:02.848 --> 33:07.685
What can I say
about dear old Jacko?

33:07.687 --> 33:11.755
Such a great little guy.
Hero.

33:11.757 --> 33:15.592
Lover. Teller of classic jokes.
What a weird little lizard?

33:18.464 --> 33:22.132
But if he had one drawback,
just one little drawback...

33:22.134 --> 33:26.103
It's his "Freaking-out-of-control..."
Are you okay?

33:28.074 --> 33:31.775
- Am I okay? Am I okay?
- Oh, yeah.

33:31.777 --> 33:34.278
I'm great. I'm great.
I'm just hangin' around,

33:34.280 --> 33:38.415
shooting the breeze here.
For six freaking days!

33:38.417 --> 33:40.217
She wants to know
if I'm okay?

33:40.219 --> 33:43.187
Am I okay, Jorge?
Jorge says I'm okay.

33:44.457 --> 33:45.923
Where are you
gumsuckers off to?

33:45.925 --> 33:47.357
The zoo.
The Sea of White Dragons.

33:48.894 --> 33:52.262
The Zoo of White Dragons!
I know exactly where that is!

33:53.599 --> 33:55.966
Let me down
and I'll show you.

33:55.968 --> 33:57.935
He's bluffing.

33:57.937 --> 34:01.972
How dare you!
Frill neck lizards never bluff!

34:01.974 --> 34:04.641
Don't listen to the lizard-hater toots.
I'm a tracker.

34:04.643 --> 34:07.945
If I can't find it,
it doesn't exist.

34:07.947 --> 34:10.813
Definitely bluffing.
Come on, Blinky, just get him out.

34:10.815 --> 34:14.083
I suppose. Dad says
always help those in need.

34:14.085 --> 34:16.987
Oh, not the tail! Very sensitive there!
Ah! Let go! Let go! Let go!

34:16.989 --> 34:20.491
Okay. Ah!
Why'd you let go?

34:21.527 --> 34:22.693
Okay.

34:22.695 --> 34:24.895
See ya, suckers! Ha-ha!

34:24.897 --> 34:26.295
What did I tell you?

34:27.699 --> 34:29.366
Time I hit the trail!

34:33.672 --> 34:37.174
What's that about
my tail, huh?

34:37.176 --> 34:40.744
Nothing, nothing.
I said hit the trail. Not the tail!

34:40.746 --> 34:43.614
Please, please! Have mercy.
I already have enough issues!

34:43.616 --> 34:46.183
Oh, poor dear.

34:46.185 --> 34:48.652
Got a reptile dysfunction,
have we?

34:48.654 --> 34:51.021
At least my tail grows back.
Goodbye!

34:52.257 --> 34:54.690
Run Nutsy!

34:54.693 --> 34:57.828
Hmm.
What do we have here?

34:57.830 --> 35:01.365
Entree and main course.

35:01.367 --> 35:03.500
Leave her alone!
Or what?

35:03.502 --> 35:05.602
Or he'll smash you!

35:05.604 --> 35:07.604
This is Blinky Bill.

35:07.606 --> 35:12.843
The meanest,
toughest explorer in the whole outback.

35:12.845 --> 35:14.311
Maybe you've
heard of him.

35:15.648 --> 35:17.447
Oh my!

35:18.050 --> 35:19.616
Really?

35:19.618 --> 35:22.586
Not the Blinky Bill.

35:22.588 --> 35:27.124
Behold the great and
wonderful Blinky Bill!

35:27.126 --> 35:28.759
Whip-kick him, Blinky.

35:30.462 --> 35:34.064
Oh, yes.
Whip-kick me, Blinky.

35:34.066 --> 35:35.265
Okay.

35:35.267 --> 35:37.601
Okay, you asked for it!

35:37.603 --> 35:40.737
Is that it?

35:42.208 --> 35:43.407
Well?

35:46.846 --> 35:47.945
Huh?

35:49.381 --> 35:51.448
- Yuck!
- Blinky!

35:51.450 --> 35:53.483
I'm going to
tear you apart!

35:53.485 --> 35:54.618
Run for it!

35:58.858 --> 36:00.791
No one panic.
I'm okay!

36:07.666 --> 36:09.266
Help!

36:15.140 --> 36:17.608
No, stop! Stop the ride!
I wanna get off now!

36:21.647 --> 36:24.114
Hey, see anything
you like?

36:25.184 --> 36:26.550
My cage!

36:32.524 --> 36:34.124
Leave it.
We gotta go.

36:34.126 --> 36:36.860
- I'm scared, Blinky.
- Ah!

36:36.862 --> 36:39.830
Everybody gets scared right?
Ow!

36:39.832 --> 36:41.565
Okay...

36:41.567 --> 36:42.866
How about you, Jacko?

36:43.969 --> 36:45.235
Are you scared?

36:45.237 --> 36:47.371
Me? Always.

36:47.373 --> 36:48.538
Ha! See?

36:49.875 --> 36:52.009
Now, come on.
Let's get out of here.

36:53.545 --> 36:58.148
Oh. Oh, right. That's it?
Not even a goodbye?

36:58.150 --> 37:02.552
Don't worry about little Jacko,
he'll be just fine...

37:07.293 --> 37:10.994
Hey! Hey! Wait for me! Come on,
I'll join you. I can be your sidekick.

37:10.996 --> 37:14.431
I'm very funny, you know,
I can tell lots of jokes. I'll keep you laughing,

37:14.433 --> 37:18.035
I'll keep it amusing, I'm very good company!
I promise! I'll keep you up!

37:18.037 --> 37:20.604
Not at night, but I mean up,
up in spirits...

37:36.088 --> 37:38.021
You know, I wasn't
always like this.

37:38.023 --> 37:42.159
Once my frill was
the pride of my family log.

37:42.161 --> 37:46.763
But all that changed the day Jorge came to town.

37:46.765 --> 37:50.834
And I will not rest until I've had my revenge on that

37:50.836 --> 37:53.870
jumped-up son of a...
Now which way?

37:53.872 --> 37:54.938
Erm...

37:54.940 --> 37:57.941
We'll never find your dad!

37:57.943 --> 37:59.943
Well, sure we will.
Watch and learn.

38:04.683 --> 38:09.219
Goodness gracious me!
That's not how you track!

38:09.221 --> 38:12.122
Work with me,
work with me you stupid thing!

38:13.525 --> 38:15.359
This rock is...

38:15.361 --> 38:17.094
Not a rock!

38:18.564 --> 38:20.497
Okay!

38:20.499 --> 38:23.133
Meep, meep, meep.

38:26.105 --> 38:29.306
Check out the lay
of the land.

38:29.308 --> 38:32.075
Position yourself
with the sun.

38:32.077 --> 38:34.077
Follow wild animal tracks.

38:36.815 --> 38:38.315
Croc, damper, lizards.

38:39.351 --> 38:40.717
Just hold on!

38:40.719 --> 38:41.818
No...

38:41.820 --> 38:44.755
Try, try, try.
Oh, yeah!

38:44.757 --> 38:46.757
That way!

38:46.759 --> 38:48.825
That way!
Oh, sure,

38:48.827 --> 38:50.894
if you want to die.
Ignore him.

38:50.896 --> 38:53.663
That frill's sucking all the blood
out of his tiny little brain.

38:53.665 --> 38:57.034
Hey, back up,
fluff-knuckle.

38:57.036 --> 39:00.904
This desert's full of crazy-eyed nut-jobs with big teeth.

39:00.906 --> 39:03.673
I'll find your Seam of Wild Drongos.
Trust me.

39:03.675 --> 39:06.610
I'm Jacko and I track-o!
You're a whack-o!

39:06.612 --> 39:09.379
Come on, Nutsy.
Nutsy?

39:09.381 --> 39:13.750
No offense,
but everything you've done so far has kind of

39:13.752 --> 39:15.352
ended in disaster.

39:17.823 --> 39:20.090
Hey! She's not
coming back-o.

39:20.092 --> 39:22.659
'Cause you just
got the sack-o.

39:24.296 --> 39:26.296
Come on, Sulky Bill!

39:26.298 --> 39:28.632
Who's sulking?
You're sulking!

39:28.634 --> 39:30.434
I'm glad I'm on my own!

39:30.436 --> 39:31.668
Yep!

39:31.670 --> 39:33.937
You go your way,
I'll go mine.

40:00.566 --> 40:03.166
I told you we should've gone with Blinky.
What?

40:12.277 --> 40:14.444
- Knock. Knock.
- What? Who's there?

40:14.446 --> 40:16.847
No, really.
I've forgotten my lines...

40:16.849 --> 40:18.615
Who am I?
Bad news, Blinky.

40:18.617 --> 40:19.816
Ah, yes.

40:19.818 --> 40:21.284
Blinky!
No-one will stand up to Cranky.

40:21.286 --> 40:23.587
- They're all scared.
- Ah, I'm sorry, Mum.

40:23.589 --> 40:26.056
I've been
a very naughty koala.

40:26.058 --> 40:29.192
Ha, well,
you do have your moments.

40:29.194 --> 40:32.028
I just wish I was
more like Robert

40:32.030 --> 40:33.930
so clever
and handsome.

40:33.932 --> 40:36.700
Well, I wouldn't
go that far.

40:36.702 --> 40:39.169
Robert has his
problems too.

40:39.171 --> 40:41.538
I wish we could go
looking for your father.

40:41.540 --> 40:43.807
But you're all I've got.

40:43.809 --> 40:47.010
If I lost you,
I don't know what I'd do.

40:48.247 --> 40:51.882
You won't lose me, Mum.
I'm right here.

40:51.884 --> 40:54.484
Behind this door.
Oh, Son.

40:54.486 --> 40:56.720
Oh, Mum.
I love you, Blinky.

40:56.722 --> 40:59.256
Oh, Mummy,
I love you too...

40:59.258 --> 41:02.392
I mean,
ah, Blinky loves you.

41:02.394 --> 41:03.760
Well, I do too, but...
Robert?

41:03.762 --> 41:06.263
Where? Who?
Oh, me!

41:06.265 --> 41:09.132
Woop! Woop!
Woop! Mum alert!

41:09.134 --> 41:10.767
<i>Attenzione! Achtung!</i>

41:10.769 --> 41:11.902
<i>C'est une catastrophe!</i>

41:11.904 --> 41:13.069
<i>Emergenza</i> koala!

41:13.071 --> 41:15.438
She knows too much!
Robert! Hide!

41:15.440 --> 41:18.074
Er, hi, Mrs. Bill.
Kids!

41:19.011 --> 41:20.210
Where's Blinky?

41:24.583 --> 41:28.685
You two think you're so smart,
don't you, cagey?

41:30.622 --> 41:34.224
I'm glad you and old freaky-frill aren't slowing me down.

41:36.528 --> 41:39.729
Gotta be tough,
tough to survive out here.

41:39.731 --> 41:43.099
That desert sun can make you a little crazy.

41:43.769 --> 41:45.235
Right, guys?

41:59.051 --> 42:01.284
Yep, yep, yep,
you shouldn't have given up on

42:01.286 --> 42:03.220
old Blinky rinky dinky Bill.

42:03.222 --> 42:05.488
Because you never
give up on your mates!

42:12.030 --> 42:14.231
But I didn't give up
on her, Dad,

42:14.233 --> 42:15.565
she gave up on me.

42:17.402 --> 42:18.501
Dad!

42:22.374 --> 42:23.940
Dad, wait!

42:30.582 --> 42:34.184
Looks like I'm having
koala for lunch.

42:44.196 --> 42:45.362
Wha...

42:50.802 --> 42:53.036
Lunch is served.

42:55.040 --> 42:57.474
Care for some pie?

42:57.476 --> 42:58.608
Huh?
Huh?

42:58.610 --> 43:01.011
Mmm! Pie!

43:01.013 --> 43:04.214
It's mainly rotten
wattle seeds and dogwood.

43:04.216 --> 43:07.717
'Course the maggots get in so there's a bit of protein.

43:11.990 --> 43:15.625
Sorry about the whole net thing,
there's a lot of predators out there.

43:15.627 --> 43:16.926
Hmm!

43:19.531 --> 43:22.499
Oh, sorry, Suzy!
Where are my manners?

43:22.501 --> 43:24.601
Let me introduce you
to the others.

43:26.038 --> 43:27.504
This is Fred.

43:27.506 --> 43:30.807
Fred runs the cafe
down by the creek.

43:30.809 --> 43:33.810
Don't order
the lunch special,

43:33.812 --> 43:35.211
not worth the aftertaste,

43:35.213 --> 43:36.346
if you know what I mean.

43:38.750 --> 43:41.384
His aftertaste,
or ours?

43:42.854 --> 43:45.255
And this is Suzy!

43:45.257 --> 43:47.891
Ah, she used to play
flamenco in a band.

43:47.893 --> 43:49.526
<i>¶ The old gray strings</i>

43:49.528 --> 43:51.661
<i>¶ They ain't what</i>
<i>they used to be... ¶</i>

43:51.663 --> 43:54.631
What? It's nothing to be
ashamed of, love.

43:57.102 --> 43:58.968
So, call me Wombo.

43:58.970 --> 44:02.105
I'm Nutsy.
Nutsy!

44:02.107 --> 44:04.140
Very nice. Classy.

44:04.142 --> 44:06.343
You're obviously
the leader of this mob.

44:06.345 --> 44:08.445
Well that's a load of old... Yes.

44:08.447 --> 44:12.916
And these are my sidekicks,
Jacko, and Fleabag.

44:12.918 --> 44:16.319
Nice to meet ya, Fleabag.

44:16.321 --> 44:19.522
Blinky, Blinky Bill.

44:19.524 --> 44:23.526
Well, shave my belly and call me a dugong!

44:23.528 --> 44:26.830
Are you Old Bill's boy?
Yes! You know him?

44:26.832 --> 44:29.666
Do I? We go way back.

44:29.668 --> 44:31.601
How is the old
budgi-smuggler?

44:31.603 --> 44:36.039
I don't know.
He went off to find the Sea of White Dragons and...

44:36.041 --> 44:39.376
Never came back.
The Sea of White Dragons?

44:39.378 --> 44:42.011
Oh, you mean, Croc Canyon?

44:42.013 --> 44:43.513
So it is a real place?

44:43.515 --> 44:47.617
Oh, my oath, it's real.
Ah, crazy Bill.

44:47.619 --> 44:50.186
Always took things
one step too far.

44:50.188 --> 44:53.022
So, where is it
and how do we get there?

44:53.024 --> 44:55.058
Why, it's just
the deepest, darkest

44:55.060 --> 44:58.495
most terrifying hell-hole
in the entire desert.

44:58.497 --> 45:03.633
Way off in the Never Never,
where the galahs don't even go.

45:03.635 --> 45:08.037
Nobody who goes in
ever comes out,

45:08.039 --> 45:11.040
alive that is.

45:11.042 --> 45:14.177
Take my advice
and turn back now.

45:14.179 --> 45:15.745
Yeah, yes, yes,
yes, great advice.

45:15.747 --> 45:18.081
Listen to the crazy
fat old wombat, Blinky.

45:19.951 --> 45:23.753
No! We have to find my dad.
Yeah. And my zoo.

45:25.223 --> 45:27.457
Crazy koalas.

45:27.459 --> 45:31.461
Well, if you're going to Croc Canyon,
you'll need a ride.

45:31.463 --> 45:33.296
Yay!

45:40.105 --> 45:41.971
Come on, girls!

45:45.410 --> 45:49.012
Erm, maybe
we can walk from here.

45:49.014 --> 45:51.381
What's that?
You want a little radio?

45:53.718 --> 45:56.486
And they're away!
Tutankhamun, an early leader.

45:56.488 --> 45:59.122
Yesterday's Lunch threatening to come
up on the outside and Pinocchio...

45:59.124 --> 46:00.757
On three,
we run for it.

46:00.759 --> 46:03.827
One, two... Ahhh!
Good day, petals!

46:03.829 --> 46:08.998
Where youse off to? I must apologize for Beryl.
She was dropped as an egg.

46:09.000 --> 46:11.668
<i>Je m'appelle</i> Cheryl.
The classy one.

46:11.670 --> 46:14.737
Pull the other one, sis.

46:14.739 --> 46:16.439
You're about as fancy
as an indoor dunny.

46:16.441 --> 46:20.410
Beryl! Manners!
Excuse the French, kiddies.

46:21.446 --> 46:25.081
Well, hello, ladies.

46:25.083 --> 46:26.249
Oh dear!

46:26.251 --> 46:27.884
Who's the frog?
Frog? What?

46:27.886 --> 46:30.854
Here's your ride.
Whatever floats your boat.

46:30.856 --> 46:33.756
What? You didn't think
I was crazy, did you?

46:35.560 --> 46:39.896
Thanks for coming so fast, girls.
Blinky and Nutsy here,

46:39.898 --> 46:41.865
well, they need
a lift to Croc Canyon.

46:41.867 --> 46:44.734
Croc Canyon!

46:51.543 --> 46:54.544
Croc Canyon!
Ah, that's a good one.

46:54.546 --> 46:56.279
Seriously, where youse going?

46:56.281 --> 46:57.747
Croc Canyon.

46:57.749 --> 46:59.315
Oh...

46:59.317 --> 47:04.854
I tried to warn them. But you know koalas,
stubborn as a box of rocks.

47:04.856 --> 47:07.824
They're looking
for Blinky's dad, old Bill.

47:07.826 --> 47:10.326
<i>Sacrebleu!</i>

47:10.328 --> 47:13.763
You don't mean old Bill,
the cane toad?

47:13.765 --> 47:18.568
No, droopy draws!
He's talking about old Bill, the echidna.

47:18.570 --> 47:21.638
The koala, remember?

47:21.640 --> 47:24.574
He saved you
from the quicksand, twice.

47:24.576 --> 47:26.409
Oh, Bill Koala!

47:26.411 --> 47:28.878
Emus, big hearts,
tiny brains.

47:28.880 --> 47:31.180
Don't worry,
they'll get you there.

47:31.182 --> 47:34.384
Oh, we owe Bill
a feather or two.

47:34.386 --> 47:36.853
Hop aboard, darls.

47:36.855 --> 47:39.422
Oi, Careful! My feathers
can get a bit...

47:39.424 --> 47:41.190
Slippery.

47:41.192 --> 47:44.127
Hey, wait for Jacko!
I'll sit up the front with you, toots.

47:47.098 --> 47:48.998
The other end's prettier.
Huh?

47:52.103 --> 47:55.872
Wombo, you coming?
Nah. Suzy'd hit the roof.

47:55.874 --> 47:57.707
Good luck,
young fella.

47:57.709 --> 48:00.476
Thanks, Wombo!
Ready, Nutsy?

48:00.478 --> 48:01.578
Time to make tracks!

48:01.580 --> 48:03.446
Let's get this
party started!

48:03.448 --> 48:05.348
Go on, get out
of here, you lot.

48:05.350 --> 48:07.750
Bye-bye!

48:09.654 --> 48:12.121
That's the last
we'll see of them!

48:12.123 --> 48:13.990
They've got no chance!

48:13.992 --> 48:16.526
Ah, they'll be
all right. I hope.

48:21.199 --> 48:24.133
- Cranky, stop!
- Blinky's gone bush.

48:24.135 --> 48:25.902
I have to save him.

48:25.904 --> 48:28.905
Out there? Impossible!

48:28.907 --> 48:32.408
By Royal decree, I strictly,
categorically and absolutely

48:32.410 --> 48:35.411
forbid all residents
from leaving Goannasburg,

48:36.314 --> 48:38.681
except koalas.

48:38.683 --> 48:42.385
Yes, I forgot.
How silly of me.

48:42.387 --> 48:47.290
May you have a long and eventful,
one-way journey, Mrs. Bill.

48:50.295 --> 48:52.629
This isn't over, Cranklepot.

48:52.631 --> 48:54.097
You kids
look after each other.

48:54.099 --> 48:55.465
Bye, Mrs. Bill.
Careful, Mrs. Bill!

48:55.467 --> 48:56.666
Good luck!

48:56.668 --> 48:59.135
Quickly, seal it.
Seal it!

49:05.043 --> 49:08.678
And then I see
Trevor on the dancefloor

49:08.680 --> 49:11.214
and he's giving me
that look, you know?

49:11.216 --> 49:13.049
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

49:13.051 --> 49:15.652
So I strolls over,
looking all chic.

49:15.654 --> 49:17.286
Mmm-hmm.

49:17.288 --> 49:20.990
Oh,
you look ridiculous!

49:20.992 --> 49:23.092
All right. Watch
and learn, sister.

49:23.094 --> 49:26.729
This is how you
strut up to a bloke.

49:26.731 --> 49:29.465
Hello, Trevor!

49:29.467 --> 49:31.467
Ha! You've got Buckley's,

49:31.469 --> 49:33.803
getting a bloke's attention
like that!

49:33.805 --> 49:38.241
You got to prowl
like a Tassie tiger.

49:38.243 --> 49:41.678
All slinky like.

49:41.680 --> 49:45.481
No.
You got to lay it on much smoother than that, sis. Oh!

49:45.483 --> 49:47.850
You got to
swerve the curves.

49:47.852 --> 49:49.986
Oh, my goodness.
That works for me!

49:49.988 --> 49:52.588
I'm swerving it.
I'm swerving it.

49:52.590 --> 49:54.323
I'm swerving it,

49:54.325 --> 49:59.562
Oops. Oh, sorry, darl.
I'll keep it straighty 180 for you.

49:59.564 --> 50:02.098
First time on an emu?
It's okay.

50:02.100 --> 50:04.934
- Don't freak out.
- I'm not freaking out.

50:04.936 --> 50:07.437
Well, it kind of looks like you're freaking out.

50:07.439 --> 50:10.073
So funny
I forgot to laugh.

50:10.075 --> 50:11.741
Oh, come on, cagey.

50:11.743 --> 50:13.943
It's time to get
a little wild.

50:16.748 --> 50:18.881
Yee-ha!
Whoo-hoo!

50:18.883 --> 50:20.283
I feel so alive!

50:22.787 --> 50:24.587
Get it off! Get it off!

50:24.589 --> 50:26.823
I could get lost
in those eyes.

50:29.294 --> 50:30.593
Beryl...

50:34.566 --> 50:35.765
Oh, wow!

50:36.634 --> 50:38.101
Whoo-hoo!

50:40.071 --> 50:42.438
I'm doing it. I'm doing it!

50:44.075 --> 50:47.510
That's great, but
you're doing it too slow.

50:49.547 --> 50:51.380
Take them!

50:51.382 --> 50:52.915
Go, buddy, go!

50:56.454 --> 50:58.921
Yeah,
let's fly baby, fly!

51:00.759 --> 51:02.058
Eat my dust!

51:02.060 --> 51:04.894
Go, Cheryl, go,
you good thing! Fly, girl!

51:07.932 --> 51:11.134
You lie, wombat!

51:11.136 --> 51:15.271
Okay! Okay,
the koalas were here!

51:15.273 --> 51:18.608
But you'll never catch them!
They're on emus!

51:18.610 --> 51:21.144
Really? Thanks for the tip.

51:21.146 --> 51:23.813
Wait! Wait! Did I say emus?
I meant tigers.

51:23.815 --> 51:26.516
Say goodbye
to Suzy, freak!

51:26.518 --> 51:28.951
Ferocious Tasmanian tigers.

51:28.953 --> 51:32.388
No! You filthy feral feline!

51:45.003 --> 51:47.503
Ah.

51:47.505 --> 51:50.106
Zoo water never tasted this good.
Yeah.

51:50.108 --> 51:52.809
My dad says the possum poop
gives it a real kick.

51:55.880 --> 51:57.747
Mum never laughs
at Dad's jokes either.

51:57.749 --> 51:59.916
She must really trust you.

51:59.918 --> 52:01.717
Letting you come out here
on your own.

52:01.719 --> 52:04.420
Er, yeah.

52:04.422 --> 52:06.889
Well, the thing is,
I kind of maybe,

52:06.891 --> 52:08.991
didn't tell her I was leaving.
Blinky!

52:08.993 --> 52:10.726
You little
frog-sucking wretch!

52:10.728 --> 52:13.996
Yes, Jorge!
We meet again!

52:13.998 --> 52:15.998
And this time,
the advantage is...

52:16.000 --> 52:17.300
Oh, butterfly!

52:19.604 --> 52:21.737
Crazy lizard!

52:21.739 --> 52:23.573
I can't believe
you ran off on your mum!

52:23.575 --> 52:26.175
I didn't!
I'm going back!

52:26.177 --> 52:30.146
Anyway, you can talk.
Where's your mum?

52:30.148 --> 52:35.117
I hardly
remember her or Dad.

52:36.254 --> 52:39.021
We lived in this
huge green forest.

52:40.191 --> 52:42.725
Until the fire came.

52:42.727 --> 52:45.761
I remember flames
and smoke everywhere.

52:45.763 --> 52:48.998
And when it cleared,
they were gone.

52:50.001 --> 52:52.568
Some humans found me
in a burnt-out tree.

52:53.571 --> 52:55.004
I've been in zoos ever since.

52:55.707 --> 52:57.106
You're all alone?

52:58.076 --> 53:00.476
I've had
lots of families,

53:00.478 --> 53:02.378
just not my own.

53:02.380 --> 53:07.416
Well, there's always room in
Greenpatch for another koala.

53:07.418 --> 53:09.852
Even a cagey one.

53:09.854 --> 53:14.223
I belong in a zoo.
You feel pretty wild to me!

53:45.623 --> 53:47.356
What about
Errol, Cheryl?

53:47.358 --> 53:49.058
He's dating
Meryl, Beryl.

53:49.060 --> 53:52.328
Meryl? Ugh.
She's totally feral.

53:52.330 --> 53:54.363
How about Daryl?
He's with Carol.

53:54.365 --> 53:56.399
Gerald?
Mmm-mmm.

53:56.401 --> 53:59.535
Harold!
Oh, you don't say!

54:00.571 --> 54:05.408
This is it, <i>mon cheries!</i>
Croc Canyon!

54:05.410 --> 54:06.742
Whoa!

54:06.744 --> 54:08.511
It's just like
Dad said it would be.

54:08.513 --> 54:12.949
Except a million times bigger and deeper and scarier.

54:17.889 --> 54:19.722
Are you sure
about this, Blinky?

54:19.724 --> 54:21.090
Er... Yep!

54:21.092 --> 54:22.992
Remember what Wombo said,

54:22.994 --> 54:24.927
"No one ever
comes out of here."

54:24.929 --> 54:26.796
Alive, that is!

54:26.798 --> 54:28.798
Not too late
to back out, kids.

54:28.800 --> 54:30.633
Excellent. Excellent.
Yes, yes, back out.

54:30.635 --> 54:32.234
There's no shame
in being a coward.

54:35.006 --> 54:36.339
Well, there's
a little shame,

54:36.341 --> 54:39.008
but not like
the shame of being dead!

54:39.010 --> 54:41.677
My dad's alive
and I'm gonna find him.

54:41.679 --> 54:44.613
But if you want to turn back,
I don't blame you.

54:44.615 --> 54:46.949
Really? Oh, phew! Great.

54:46.951 --> 54:49.852
Okay, but if you
get us munched.

54:49.854 --> 54:53.823
I smash you.
Okay. We're going in.

54:53.825 --> 54:54.957
We?

54:54.959 --> 54:58.394
Bon voyage, kids!
It was nice knowing you!

55:01.532 --> 55:02.898
If I don't make it,

55:02.900 --> 55:06.035
just remember
I've always loved you, Beryl.

55:06.037 --> 55:08.971
<i>Je m'appelle</i> Cheryl.
She's Beryl.

55:10.475 --> 55:12.241
Hmm, same diff...

55:12.243 --> 55:13.943
Hey, wait for Jacko!

55:13.945 --> 55:16.579
This is why koalas
are going extinct.

55:19.917 --> 55:21.617
Oh, no!

55:23.921 --> 55:27.123
Oh, Wombo!

55:27.125 --> 55:29.358
What happened?
Are you okay?

55:29.360 --> 55:33.829
Oh, Betty!
Betty, you're a sight for squinty eyes.

55:33.831 --> 55:35.498
Be a mate and unclip us,
would you?

55:39.170 --> 55:41.037
Suzy! Hang in there, Suze.

55:41.506 --> 55:43.172
I'm coming.

55:43.174 --> 55:45.341
Wait a minute.

55:45.343 --> 55:47.576
Did Blinky do this?
Goodness, no.

55:47.578 --> 55:50.312
That crazy cat
who's hunting him did.

55:50.314 --> 55:52.148
What?
Oh, don't worry!

55:52.150 --> 55:54.150
Blinky's got
a good head start on him.

55:54.152 --> 55:56.685
He's on his way to Croc Canyon.
What?

55:56.687 --> 55:58.421
Wombo! We have to stop him!

55:58.423 --> 56:00.256
Stop him, how?

56:00.258 --> 56:03.526
'Course she's not my girlfriend.
Don't be so dippy.

56:03.528 --> 56:07.263
Jeez, here we go,
the waterworks. Don't cry, love.

56:07.265 --> 56:10.833
Don't cry, I'll bring you
back something nice!

56:11.803 --> 56:13.302
How about
a new hat?

56:13.304 --> 56:15.304
Wombo, we're taking your car.

56:15.306 --> 56:19.642
Yeah good id... Wait a whisker.
I'm the crazy one here.

56:35.526 --> 56:37.593
Blinky, not so fast.

56:37.595 --> 56:38.928
You're doing fine.

56:38.930 --> 56:40.162
Just don't look down.

56:40.164 --> 56:42.665
Don't look down?
It's all down!

56:42.667 --> 56:45.167
Oh, I should have
stayed in my log.

57:08.993 --> 57:12.328
Dad? Dad?

57:14.432 --> 57:15.698
Dad?

57:19.470 --> 57:20.669
Dad?

57:20.671 --> 57:23.272
I wonder why they
call it Croc Canyon?

57:23.274 --> 57:25.241
Maybe they mean
rock canyon.

57:25.243 --> 57:28.110
Where are you?

57:28.112 --> 57:32.114
What's that smell?
It's kind of like rotten...

57:32.116 --> 57:33.849
...lizard.
Not me...

57:33.851 --> 57:36.952
Hmm,
well, perhaps it is me.

57:37.655 --> 57:39.255
Dad?

57:39.257 --> 57:40.689
Oops.

57:40.691 --> 57:43.125
I've got
a bad feeling, Blinky.

57:43.127 --> 57:44.627
I second that emotion.

57:52.136 --> 57:53.502
Hey, look!

57:55.206 --> 57:56.438
Dad!

57:56.440 --> 57:58.741
Hey, Dad!
Down here! Dad! Shh!

57:58.743 --> 57:59.975
Dad!
Blinky!

58:02.780 --> 58:03.846
Run!

58:03.848 --> 58:05.548
Wait for me!

58:13.090 --> 58:15.391
- We're related!
- We're related!

58:15.393 --> 58:17.059
Hey, we're just brothers from another mother!

58:27.738 --> 58:29.505
Come on!
Come on! Come on!

58:30.174 --> 58:32.641
Climb! Climb!

58:32.643 --> 58:35.477
I am climbing,
I am climbing!

58:39.584 --> 58:40.716
Blinky!

58:49.360 --> 58:51.894
How did...

58:51.896 --> 58:53.162
Surprise!

58:53.164 --> 58:54.763
Doesn't he ever give up?

59:07.078 --> 59:08.677
He's gone! Come on!

59:11.449 --> 59:13.048
We've almost
made it, guys!

59:13.050 --> 59:14.350
No, you don't!

59:24.061 --> 59:26.695
Come on Nutsy,
we got this! No, wait!

59:26.697 --> 59:28.430
Really?

59:34.505 --> 59:36.171
Nutsy! Jump!

59:36.173 --> 59:38.307
I can't. It's too far!

59:40.077 --> 59:41.710
Blinky!

59:41.712 --> 59:42.811
Come on!

59:43.881 --> 59:45.514
Oh, no!

59:45.516 --> 59:46.582
Yes!

59:47.218 --> 59:48.817
Nutsy, back up!

59:57.094 --> 59:59.428
Don't move.
Oh, I can't look.

59:59.430 --> 01:00:01.130
Ho, ho, ho. I can.

01:00:01.132 --> 01:00:02.331
What?

01:00:02.333 --> 01:00:04.833
It's too far for me to
carry us both across.

01:00:05.770 --> 01:00:07.336
Ah! Bulls-eye!

01:00:07.338 --> 01:00:10.239
Do that again
and I'll eat you first!

01:00:11.609 --> 01:00:13.208
Nutsy, I've got a plan.

01:00:14.879 --> 01:00:19.915
Hey! Fish-face! Yeah, you!
What's the matter, croc got your tail?

01:00:20.885 --> 01:00:22.084
Now!

01:00:24.955 --> 01:00:26.522
Whoo-hoo!

01:00:26.524 --> 01:00:29.058
Oh, yeah!
Whoo-hoo! You did it!

01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:33.562
Hey, guess what?
I think you just invented the cat-apult!

01:00:35.066 --> 01:00:36.565
Back off, dinosaurs.

01:00:38.703 --> 01:00:43.172
Oh, those Crocs will be coughing up some big fur balls.

01:00:43.174 --> 01:00:47.710
Blinky, does saving me always
have to be this scary and painful?

01:00:47.712 --> 01:00:48.977
Dad! Ha!

01:00:53.517 --> 01:00:54.650
Dad!

01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:57.419
Dad! It's me!

01:00:57.421 --> 01:00:59.988
It's Blinky...

01:01:07.832 --> 01:01:09.798
This...

01:01:11.302 --> 01:01:13.736
This is his hat.
What the...

01:01:17.074 --> 01:01:18.340
Blinky?

01:01:20.111 --> 01:01:21.310
Huh?

01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:23.846
No...

01:01:24.281 --> 01:01:25.547
Dad.

01:01:28.686 --> 01:01:30.452
Th... Th...
That's his swag.

01:01:30.454 --> 01:01:33.255
Dad! Dad!
Dad, where are you?

01:01:33.257 --> 01:01:36.325
Dad? Oh.

01:01:39.663 --> 01:01:42.398
Yoo-hoo? Mr. Bill?

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:44.366
- Oh!
- No...

01:01:45.302 --> 01:01:48.871
Dad. It can't be.

01:01:48.873 --> 01:01:51.440
Hey, those bones
could be anyone's.

01:01:51.442 --> 01:01:52.875
This is his hat.

01:01:52.877 --> 01:01:54.643
You can't give up!

01:01:54.645 --> 01:01:58.547
Yeah.
Dad used to say that too.

01:02:03.387 --> 01:02:04.553
Come on, Jacko.

01:02:18.969 --> 01:02:20.636
I'm sorry, Mum.

01:02:47.097 --> 01:02:48.597
You were right.

01:02:49.633 --> 01:02:53.202
Everything I do
ends in disaster.

01:03:00.344 --> 01:03:02.044
I'm sorry, Nutsy.

01:03:04.982 --> 01:03:07.216
But I'm gonna do
one thing right.

01:03:18.629 --> 01:03:20.562
I'm going to get you home.

01:03:22.700 --> 01:03:24.566
It's what Dad
would have done.

01:04:07.278 --> 01:04:08.777
Oh, no.
I'm not a crocodile.

01:04:18.255 --> 01:04:20.088
Oh, Blinky.

01:04:20.090 --> 01:04:23.625
I've been watching lights going in and out of there,
all night.

01:04:24.628 --> 01:04:26.361
I think that's your zoo.

01:04:26.363 --> 01:04:28.830
Really? You think so?

01:04:28.832 --> 01:04:30.332
Only one way to find out!

01:04:32.937 --> 01:04:34.069
What's for breaky,
sweet-cheeks?

01:04:36.106 --> 01:04:38.240
Hmm, what?
What'd I miss?

01:04:41.512 --> 01:04:44.580
Oh, now that is
definitely a lake.

01:04:44.582 --> 01:04:47.182
Er, it's a mirage.

01:04:47.184 --> 01:04:50.052
What about those
shady trees, then?

01:04:50.054 --> 01:04:52.554
Mirage.

01:04:57.761 --> 01:05:01.563
What about that opera house-shaped
car being driven by a wombat?

01:05:02.633 --> 01:05:04.800
Definitely a mirage.

01:05:10.374 --> 01:05:13.308
Hello, me little lovelies!
Where are the kids?

01:05:24.154 --> 01:05:27.389
Well, I guess this is it.

01:05:27.391 --> 01:05:31.026
Ahem, well,
I guess this is it.

01:05:31.028 --> 01:05:34.463
Uh-huh. Yep.
Indeedy-do.

01:05:34.465 --> 01:05:38.266
End of the road.
The old zoo-mcgoo.

01:05:38.268 --> 01:05:39.968
Home-sweet-home...

01:05:39.970 --> 01:05:42.004
Yay.

01:05:42.006 --> 01:05:43.639
I'm actually gonna
miss you, Jacko.

01:05:43.641 --> 01:05:45.273
Oh, cheer up, toots.

01:05:45.275 --> 01:05:47.542
We'll always
have Croc Canyon.

01:05:47.544 --> 01:05:48.877
Are you sure
about this?

01:05:49.847 --> 01:05:52.180
Whoa!

01:05:53.817 --> 01:05:55.584
Thanks, Blinky.

01:05:55.586 --> 01:05:58.654
It's been an adventure.
Yep.

01:05:58.656 --> 01:06:00.255
Definitely an adventure.

01:06:02.159 --> 01:06:03.425
Bye.

01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:12.000
I guess you're a real
explorer, after all.

01:06:12.002 --> 01:06:13.535
That makes two of us.

01:06:14.738 --> 01:06:16.471
Hey...

01:06:16.473 --> 01:06:19.007
I'm not scared
of heights anymore.

01:06:22.212 --> 01:06:25.313
Is there still room in Greenpatch for a cage koala?

01:06:25.315 --> 01:06:26.648
Nope.

01:06:26.650 --> 01:06:29.351
You're not a cage koala.
You're wild.

01:06:29.353 --> 01:06:31.586
So get your fluffy
butt down here.

01:06:31.588 --> 01:06:32.788
We're going home.

01:06:32.790 --> 01:06:34.589
Lost, little guy?

01:06:34.591 --> 01:06:36.158
Don't worry.

01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:37.826
Huh!
We'll look after you.

01:06:39.396 --> 01:06:41.296
Oh, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no!

01:06:43.067 --> 01:06:44.299
Huh?

01:06:45.869 --> 01:06:48.870
Hey, brainiac,
you got the wrong one!

01:06:48.872 --> 01:06:50.906
Quick, Jacko,
we have to save him! Oh!

01:06:58.782 --> 01:07:00.782
Easy, little guy.

01:07:00.784 --> 01:07:03.819
Once you get your shots,
you can join the other koalas.

01:07:10.060 --> 01:07:11.760
Let me out!

01:07:13.731 --> 01:07:16.865
<i>¶ Swing me higher,</i>
<i>baby-cakes ¶</i>

01:07:16.867 --> 01:07:18.633
Oh, yes. That's nice.

01:07:18.635 --> 01:07:21.937
Hey! Hey, buddy!
Over here! Help me!

01:07:23.874 --> 01:07:26.074
I don't belong here!
I'm wild!

01:07:26.076 --> 01:07:27.509
Hey, new guy. Zip it.

01:07:27.511 --> 01:07:29.611
You don't want to wake
old feather-brain.

01:07:29.613 --> 01:07:32.481
You zip it!
I have to get back to Greenpatch.

01:07:32.483 --> 01:07:35.250
Greenpatch? Blinky?
Dad?

01:07:35.252 --> 01:07:36.451
Get out of here!

01:07:36.453 --> 01:07:37.886
Dad!
Blinky Bill?

01:07:37.888 --> 01:07:39.321
Where are you, Dad?
I'm here, Son.

01:07:40.524 --> 01:07:42.891
Oh, Dad!
Blinky! How'd you get here?

01:07:42.893 --> 01:07:44.960
Are you okay, Son? You first.
What are you doing here?

01:07:44.962 --> 01:07:46.495
What happened
to you, Dad?

01:07:46.497 --> 01:07:50.665
Oh, mate.
The Sea of White Dragons happened.

01:07:50.667 --> 01:07:52.934
Some call it Croc Canyon,

01:07:52.936 --> 01:07:55.036
some call it
the Down-underworld.

01:07:55.038 --> 01:07:58.774
Most take one look
and call it a day.

01:07:58.776 --> 01:08:02.878
It's, paws-down,
the most blood-curdling pit of despair

01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:05.013
I have ever clapped eyes on.

01:08:05.015 --> 01:08:08.550
With giant rock walls
all the way up to the sky.

01:08:08.552 --> 01:08:10.852
Oh, further, mate.

01:08:10.854 --> 01:08:13.255
And filled with
scaly tooth monsters

01:08:13.257 --> 01:08:14.656
with beady little eyes.

01:08:14.658 --> 01:08:16.892
But you can't
show them any fear!

01:08:16.894 --> 01:08:19.795
Oh, no.
They smell fear.

01:08:19.796 --> 01:08:22.464
All you can do is
grab your gumnuts and run.

01:08:22.466 --> 01:08:23.965
Yeah! And jump!

01:08:23.966 --> 01:08:26.334
From rock...
...to rock. Nearly there.

01:08:26.336 --> 01:08:30.438
One more jump.
It's a biggie. One, two...

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:31.573
Three!

01:08:31.575 --> 01:08:33.475
And you
make the other side!

01:08:33.477 --> 01:08:35.710
Oh, just!

01:08:35.712 --> 01:08:38.279
I was chewed up real bad.

01:08:38.282 --> 01:08:40.381
Croc teeth sticking out
all over me

01:08:40.384 --> 01:08:43.518
like some kind of
crazy echidna.

01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:45.821
I guess I must've passed out.

01:08:45.823 --> 01:08:50.258
When I woke up,
I was here. But...

01:08:50.260 --> 01:08:52.694
Hang on a bilby whisker.

01:08:52.696 --> 01:08:54.229
How'd you know about...

01:08:54.231 --> 01:08:55.964
Were you there?
Yeah.

01:08:55.966 --> 01:08:57.332
Shut your leaf hole!

01:08:57.334 --> 01:08:59.667
My boy got through
Croc Canyon?

01:08:59.670 --> 01:09:01.303
Are you okay, Son?
Yep.

01:09:01.305 --> 01:09:03.037
We were nearly
croc snacks, too.

01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:06.575
We? Is Mum
with you? Betty?

01:09:06.577 --> 01:09:08.475
Love! It's okay.
Mum's at home!

01:09:08.478 --> 01:09:09.978
She doesn't even know
I'm gone.

01:09:15.519 --> 01:09:17.786
Well, it's good to hear
Mum's safe and sound.

01:09:17.787 --> 01:09:19.888
Erm, not quite.

01:09:19.890 --> 01:09:22.290
Cranky's taken
over Greenpatch.

01:09:22.292 --> 01:09:25.060
He's gonna throw Mum out of our tree.
What?

01:09:25.062 --> 01:09:27.595
Oh, that slug-sucking
bilby-tickler.

01:09:27.598 --> 01:09:28.964
If I could only
get my paws on him.

01:09:28.966 --> 01:09:34.135
But you can! Let's go kick
some Goanna butt! Dad?

01:09:34.136 --> 01:09:36.438
Come on! Greenpatch needs us.

01:09:36.907 --> 01:09:38.506
Mate,

01:09:38.508 --> 01:09:42.077
I've been trying to come
home since I got here.

01:09:42.078 --> 01:09:45.046
I did this last week trying to jump the boundary wall.

01:09:45.048 --> 01:09:46.715
It can't be done.

01:09:46.716 --> 01:09:50.819
There's cameras,
zoo-keepers, alarms,

01:09:50.821 --> 01:09:54.189
that big-mouth parrot.
No one ever gets out.

01:09:54.191 --> 01:09:56.424
But what about Mum?

01:09:56.426 --> 01:09:58.693
Oh, I'm sorry, Blink.

01:09:59.730 --> 01:10:03.131
No! There's got to
be a way out!

01:10:03.133 --> 01:10:06.334
You promised Mum,
you said you'd come home!

01:10:06.336 --> 01:10:10.005
I promised
a lot of things.

01:10:11.942 --> 01:10:15.310
Mum.
Blinky? Mate?

01:10:16.146 --> 01:10:18.513
Oh, Blink.

01:10:35.432 --> 01:10:37.198
Shh!

01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:39.000
Come on, Jacko.
Huh?

01:10:39.002 --> 01:10:40.635
The first place they take you is quarantine.
Oh!

01:10:40.637 --> 01:10:42.837
Warren who?

01:10:42.839 --> 01:10:48.376
No escape. If I don't get out,
nobody does.

01:10:48.378 --> 01:10:50.946
Oi, parrot,
would you shut your...

01:10:57.554 --> 01:10:58.853
Hmm.

01:10:59.222 --> 01:11:00.755
Hey, Dad.

01:11:01.692 --> 01:11:03.892
Blinky?
I think we can do this.

01:11:03.894 --> 01:11:06.861
Oh, mate, I've tried.

01:11:06.863 --> 01:11:08.430
You never had me.

01:11:08.432 --> 01:11:09.731
Yeah, well, that's true.

01:11:09.733 --> 01:11:11.933
What do us adventurers
always say?

01:11:11.935 --> 01:11:13.668
Always fart downwind?

01:11:13.670 --> 01:11:15.403
Yeah, the other thing.

01:11:15.405 --> 01:11:18.273
An adventurer
never gives up.

01:11:18.275 --> 01:11:20.976
And? An adventurer...

01:11:20.978 --> 01:11:23.345
Keeps his promise!

01:11:23.347 --> 01:11:26.648
Too right!
And you promised Mum you'd come home!

01:11:26.650 --> 01:11:28.783
Grab your gumnuts, Dad.

01:11:28.785 --> 01:11:32.354
- We're busting outta here.
- Paws in?

01:11:32.356 --> 01:11:35.623
- That's my boy.
- Paws in!

01:11:38.862 --> 01:11:39.761
So I says to Prince Charming,
if you like it,

01:11:39.763 --> 01:11:40.862
put a ring on it.

01:11:40.864 --> 01:11:42.030
The kids were
definitely here.

01:11:44.134 --> 01:11:46.835
You said something
about a zoo, right?

01:11:48.238 --> 01:11:49.738
Got it!
Okay.

01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:51.806
Yes!

01:12:05.522 --> 01:12:06.888
That's it!

01:12:12.129 --> 01:12:15.864
Higher. Cripes.
What's mum been feeding you?

01:12:15.866 --> 01:12:17.365
Nearly there.

01:12:17.367 --> 01:12:19.300
Dad, the fan!

01:12:19.302 --> 01:12:20.535
Stop!

01:12:33.683 --> 01:12:35.183
I'll just go grab it
out of the truck.

01:12:35.185 --> 01:12:37.018
Ca-caw! Ca-caw!

01:12:37.020 --> 01:12:39.087
Birdy num...

01:12:40.991 --> 01:12:42.357
Come on, mate!

01:12:43.794 --> 01:12:45.927
Okay. Here goes.

01:12:55.372 --> 01:12:58.073
Ah, yes, the drain,
what a brilliant idea.

01:13:01.845 --> 01:13:04.179
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Almost! Almost!

01:13:04.181 --> 01:13:05.713
Push the thing!

01:13:06.650 --> 01:13:07.949
Whoa!

01:13:17.194 --> 01:13:19.360
Come on, Son,
get a wriggle on!

01:13:21.598 --> 01:13:22.664
Got it!

01:13:22.666 --> 01:13:23.731
Blinky?
Huh?

01:13:23.733 --> 01:13:24.899
Who's that?

01:13:24.901 --> 01:13:26.534
Whoa! Blinky!

01:13:27.370 --> 01:13:28.703
Blinky!

01:13:30.907 --> 01:13:33.942
I'm a bad boy

01:13:37.547 --> 01:13:39.380
Oh, I've missed you, Son!

01:13:39.382 --> 01:13:42.083
I've missed you
so much too, Dad!

01:13:42.085 --> 01:13:45.286
Shake, Nose.
Boomerang returns.

01:13:45.288 --> 01:13:46.754
Cheeky.

01:13:46.756 --> 01:13:49.057
Right left.
Whip-kick. Whoa!

01:13:49.059 --> 01:13:52.427
Easy there.

01:13:52.429 --> 01:13:55.396
So you going to introduce me to your girlfriend then?

01:13:55.398 --> 01:13:58.466
What? Oh. Er...

01:13:58.468 --> 01:14:00.401
She's not my girlfr...
We're not...

01:14:01.304 --> 01:14:03.805
This is my friend, Nutsy.

01:14:03.807 --> 01:14:05.874
I've heard so much
about you, Mr. Bill!

01:14:05.876 --> 01:14:07.108
Don't believe
any of it!

01:14:07.677 --> 01:14:08.977
Oh!

01:14:09.946 --> 01:14:11.846
Intruders!

01:14:11.848 --> 01:14:15.183
<i>Wild animals!</i>
<i>Help! Security!</i> Oh!

01:14:15.185 --> 01:14:17.785
That is
one crazy bird.

01:14:17.787 --> 01:14:20.255
Good afternoon,
welcome to Parrot Radio.

01:14:20.257 --> 01:14:22.724
For your listening pleasure,
may I present to you,

01:14:22.726 --> 01:14:25.426
a breakout people!

01:14:25.428 --> 01:14:27.896
Security!
Dad?

01:14:27.898 --> 01:14:29.531
Right! We're going
out the window!

01:14:29.533 --> 01:14:32.934
Move! Ah! Okay,
maybe the door.

01:14:32.936 --> 01:14:35.336
With their backs against the wall,
our koalas look cooked.

01:14:35.338 --> 01:14:37.906
Will they climb their way to freedom,
dear listeners?

01:14:37.908 --> 01:14:41.476
Of course not! Are you crazy?
No one ever gets out!

01:14:41.478 --> 01:14:44.445
Hey, check camera two.
Security! Security!

01:14:44.447 --> 01:14:46.114
I'm okay! Don't panic!

01:14:46.116 --> 01:14:47.849
Quick, everyone in there!

01:14:47.851 --> 01:14:49.951
Mmm, I like her.

01:14:49.953 --> 01:14:53.354
One, two, three.

01:14:53.356 --> 01:14:56.491
Go, go, go!
I wouldn't go down that way if I were you.

01:14:56.493 --> 01:15:00.061
A break-out, people!
This is not a drill! Jacko!

01:15:00.063 --> 01:15:01.262
You!

01:15:01.264 --> 01:15:02.430
You!

01:15:09.139 --> 01:15:11.005
Whoa! Phew!

01:15:11.007 --> 01:15:12.207
Clear.

01:15:14.744 --> 01:15:16.578
Let us never
speak of that again.

01:15:16.580 --> 01:15:18.646
Hmm, well, I did
try to warn you.

01:15:18.648 --> 01:15:21.082
Check the perimeter.
They can't have gone far.

01:15:33.597 --> 01:15:36.130
Those koalas have got to be around here, somewhere.
Check over there!

01:15:36.132 --> 01:15:38.066
Cripes. They're onto us.

01:15:38.068 --> 01:15:39.901
We'll never get through.
I think they're over here somewhere.

01:15:39.903 --> 01:15:41.970
Maybe we can go over?
Over?

01:15:41.972 --> 01:15:44.973
How? You mean, like fly?

01:15:44.975 --> 01:15:46.941
Son, that's crazy!

01:15:46.943 --> 01:15:48.076
I like it.

01:15:48.078 --> 01:15:50.912
Well, well, well.

01:15:51.648 --> 01:15:53.982
Hello, Jacko.

01:15:53.984 --> 01:15:56.351
Hello, Jorge.

01:15:56.353 --> 01:15:58.052
Wait a minute,
you two know each other?

01:15:58.054 --> 01:16:01.222
Oh, yes.
Yes, we do.

01:16:02.459 --> 01:16:06.394
You go. I'll deal
with the parrot.

01:16:06.396 --> 01:16:08.162
Are you sure?
Yes, go!

01:16:11.034 --> 01:16:13.868
This ends now, gibbet!

01:16:13.870 --> 01:16:17.538
You said that
last time, grub-sucker,

01:16:17.540 --> 01:16:19.707
yet here we are.

01:16:19.709 --> 01:16:21.309
How did it come to this?

01:16:21.311 --> 01:16:24.445
I loved you like a brother!

01:16:24.447 --> 01:16:27.415
You fool! I am your brother!

01:16:27.417 --> 01:16:29.917
What? That's impossible!

01:16:29.919 --> 01:16:32.287
Is it, Jacko? Is it?

01:16:44.134 --> 01:16:46.200
Come on, Dad!

01:16:49.472 --> 01:16:51.172
<i>All personnel to sector four.</i>

01:16:51.174 --> 01:16:53.041
<i>We have a marsupial escape</i>
<i>in progress.</i>

01:16:53.043 --> 01:16:56.177
<i>I repeat, wild koalas</i>
<i>in sector four.</i>

01:16:56.179 --> 01:16:58.313
Dad, grab some rope
to tie things together.

01:16:58.315 --> 01:16:59.447
Over there.
Yeah, got it.

01:16:59.449 --> 01:17:01.482
Nutsy, something
wide and strong.

01:17:01.484 --> 01:17:03.284
Er, that wavy
see-through stuff.

01:17:03.286 --> 01:17:04.986
Are you sure
about this, Blinky?

01:17:04.988 --> 01:17:06.888
It'll work. Trust me.

01:17:06.890 --> 01:17:08.923
Return
what you have stolen!

01:17:08.925 --> 01:17:11.292
Return what you
have stolen!

01:17:11.294 --> 01:17:12.827
Ow! Ah! I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:17:12.829 --> 01:17:14.128
Do you take me
for a turkey?

01:17:14.130 --> 01:17:16.497
Ow! Ah! Stop!
Stop, stop, stop!

01:17:16.499 --> 01:17:21.436
Liar! I saw you!
Flashing your frill at my beautiful Consuela!

01:17:21.438 --> 01:17:23.371
How could you?

01:17:23.373 --> 01:17:26.074
Con, Consuela? What? No, no, no,
you've got it all wrong.

01:17:26.076 --> 01:17:29.243
Do I, lover boy?
Yes, yes, yes you do.

01:17:29.245 --> 01:17:31.446
She wasn't interested
in me. Or you.

01:17:31.448 --> 01:17:33.881
She said she was leaving.
With Trevor.

01:17:33.883 --> 01:17:37.151
Not Trevor!

01:17:37.153 --> 01:17:40.955
With those infernal
fancy tail feathers!

01:17:40.957 --> 01:17:44.926
Oh, I'll track down that
over-stuffed bush turkey!

01:17:44.928 --> 01:17:49.097
And when I do,
I'll be doing the plucking.

01:17:49.099 --> 01:17:51.632
Trevor!
Yeah, yeah that's great.

01:17:51.634 --> 01:17:55.269
Hey, Jorge.
Yes, brother?

01:17:55.271 --> 01:17:58.339
Er, with you having a new
nemesis and everything.

01:17:58.341 --> 01:18:02.176
Hmm?
Would you mind getting off me now?

01:18:02.178 --> 01:18:03.945
Where the heck
are those koalas?

01:18:03.947 --> 01:18:05.313
They can't have just vanished.

01:18:05.315 --> 01:18:07.315
Hey! What the...
I don't believe it!

01:18:07.317 --> 01:18:08.916
Cop a gander of this,
would you?

01:18:08.918 --> 01:18:10.351
Who's driving
that thing?

01:18:10.353 --> 01:18:12.019
That's the hairiest cabbie
I've ever seen.

01:18:12.021 --> 01:18:13.254
Wasn't your missus,
was it?

01:18:17.060 --> 01:18:18.960
They'll give a license
to anyone these days.

01:18:18.962 --> 01:18:21.329
Once we get inside,
we'll split up. Come on!

01:18:24.467 --> 01:18:27.135
Done. Hmm, I think.

01:18:27.137 --> 01:18:30.004
Jorge!

01:18:30.006 --> 01:18:31.939
Hey!
It's okay.

01:18:31.941 --> 01:18:33.808
- The parrot's with me.
- Huh?

01:18:33.810 --> 01:18:35.576
Sweet shining skink eggs.

01:18:35.578 --> 01:18:36.644
What is that?

01:18:36.646 --> 01:18:38.012
This is our way
out of here.

01:18:38.014 --> 01:18:40.581
What!
He's joking, right?

01:18:40.583 --> 01:18:42.250
It'll work.
Come on!

01:18:42.252 --> 01:18:44.719
Huh, and I thought you were nuts.
Hold me, brother.

01:18:44.721 --> 01:18:46.354
I'm too young to fly!

01:18:46.356 --> 01:18:48.389
Er, guys,
we need to hurry.

01:18:48.391 --> 01:18:50.792
What in the blue blazes?
How did...

01:18:50.794 --> 01:18:52.193
We're gonna
need a ladder!

01:18:53.630 --> 01:18:55.129
The humans have
seen us!

01:18:55.131 --> 01:18:58.099
Everyone, on my count
push as hard as you can.

01:18:58.101 --> 01:19:01.903
Got it?
Now this is what I call an adventure!

01:19:01.905 --> 01:19:03.738
Yes, indeed.

01:19:03.740 --> 01:19:07.475
An epic tale of a peppy
little kitten's struggle

01:19:07.477 --> 01:19:09.710
against the forces
of koala-dom.

01:19:09.712 --> 01:19:15.249
Sweet mother of dog!
The tail-biter!

01:19:15.251 --> 01:19:18.286
Fair go, mate.
I was trying to save you from a trap!

01:19:18.288 --> 01:19:19.420
You would've died.

01:19:19.422 --> 01:19:21.055
Dad?
Stay behind me, Blinky!

01:19:21.057 --> 01:19:22.990
I would never
ask for your help.

01:19:23.593 --> 01:19:27.628
And now, you'll pay.

01:19:29.766 --> 01:19:31.399
Back off, kitty!

01:19:32.802 --> 01:19:33.968
Dad!

01:19:37.740 --> 01:19:40.508
I'm going to turn you
into a snuggy.

01:19:40.510 --> 01:19:42.109
Get off him!

01:19:42.111 --> 01:19:43.244
Go, Dad!

01:19:43.246 --> 01:19:44.879
Blinky!

01:19:44.881 --> 01:19:46.013
Blinky! No!

01:19:46.015 --> 01:19:47.915
No, you don't!
The koala is mine!

01:19:47.917 --> 01:19:49.984
Blinky!

01:19:49.986 --> 01:19:53.387
To the flyer!
We're not leaving without my boy!

01:19:55.325 --> 01:19:56.924
Whoa, look out, cat!

01:19:56.926 --> 01:19:59.160
Everyone, push
as hard as you can.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:05.533
Push harder, Jacko!

01:20:05.535 --> 01:20:08.636
If I push any harder,
something's gonna come out.

01:20:12.108 --> 01:20:15.643
It worked! Don't worry, Son!
We're coming for you!

01:20:22.886 --> 01:20:25.119
Oh!
Oh, right! What now?

01:20:25.121 --> 01:20:26.254
Whoa!

01:20:26.256 --> 01:20:28.422
- Need a lift?
- Ladies!

01:20:29.726 --> 01:20:32.360
After my boy!
<i>Tout de suite,</i> Mr. Bill.

01:20:35.231 --> 01:20:37.231
Stop running, meat snack.

01:20:37.233 --> 01:20:38.566
You're only
making me hungrier!

01:20:38.568 --> 01:20:40.401
Come on, girls,
crack the whip!

01:20:40.403 --> 01:20:42.470
Go, baby cakes, go!

01:20:42.472 --> 01:20:44.138
It's working, Cheryl!

01:20:44.140 --> 01:20:48.175
We're flying!
Oh, we're really flying!

01:20:48.177 --> 01:20:50.278
Whoa!
How do you control this?

01:20:51.781 --> 01:20:52.947
Come on!

01:20:52.949 --> 01:20:55.016
Blinky! We're coming, mate!

01:20:55.018 --> 01:20:56.884
Just try
not to get eaten!

01:20:57.687 --> 01:20:59.420
Dad!
Grab the rope!

01:21:06.496 --> 01:21:09.897
Right, well, that worked
better in my head.

01:21:09.899 --> 01:21:11.365
I'm going to go down
and get him.

01:21:11.367 --> 01:21:13.267
Are you crazy?
They don't call her Nutsy for nothing.

01:21:17.073 --> 01:21:19.974
Remember how you used to be
completely terrified of heights?

01:21:19.976 --> 01:21:22.677
Well, forget that,
don't remember it.

01:21:22.679 --> 01:21:25.446
Not helping!
Nutsy!

01:21:27.617 --> 01:21:28.749
Huh?

01:21:30.954 --> 01:21:33.187
Whoa!

01:21:33.189 --> 01:21:35.256
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!
We have to get out of here!

01:21:35.258 --> 01:21:36.791
I'll swing you in!

01:21:40.964 --> 01:21:43.798
Shh. I don't think
we're alone.

01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:46.701
Oh, don't worry.
I soon will be.

01:21:46.703 --> 01:21:49.604
Blinky! Whoa!

01:21:49.606 --> 01:21:51.072
Nutsy!

01:21:58.748 --> 01:22:01.716
Oh! Not again!

01:22:01.718 --> 01:22:03.751
Grab the rope, Blinky!
Okay!

01:22:09.759 --> 01:22:12.927
Oh, yes.

01:22:14.597 --> 01:22:17.431
Playtime's over.

01:22:17.433 --> 01:22:19.834
Time to explore the afterlife!

01:22:21.270 --> 01:22:23.304
Get your paws
off my son!

01:22:25.441 --> 01:22:29.243
Mum! Oh!
You are so grounded.

01:22:34.417 --> 01:22:37.385
This time,
I've definitely got you!

01:22:38.988 --> 01:22:40.488
Grab, the rope...

01:22:40.490 --> 01:22:43.190
Hang on tight!
Grab the rope.

01:22:43.192 --> 01:22:44.792
Oh! Help!

01:22:44.794 --> 01:22:47.728
Mum, this is
my friend Nutsy.

01:22:47.730 --> 01:22:48.829
It's a pleasure.

01:22:50.700 --> 01:22:54.035
I will devour
every last one of you!

01:22:59.075 --> 01:23:01.175
Huh?

01:23:01.177 --> 01:23:02.810
Take her up!

01:23:02.812 --> 01:23:04.645
Ah, yep. On it!

01:23:04.647 --> 01:23:06.881
Come on,
you son of a skink!

01:23:13.623 --> 01:23:15.423
Quick! My friends
will save us!

01:23:15.425 --> 01:23:19.093
Pah! Who needs friends
when you've got nine lives?

01:23:22.799 --> 01:23:24.231
Huh?

01:23:24.233 --> 01:23:25.366
Mummy.

01:23:27.870 --> 01:23:29.203
Whoa!

01:23:31.841 --> 01:23:34.308
Mum, Nutsy,
are you okay?

01:23:34.310 --> 01:23:35.576
Yes.

01:23:41.117 --> 01:23:42.883
I knew you'd
make it, Blinky!

01:23:42.885 --> 01:23:46.654
Looks like
koalas can fly!

01:23:48.491 --> 01:23:50.591
Love!
Bill!

01:23:50.593 --> 01:23:52.326
Oh!

01:23:52.328 --> 01:23:55.029
Oh, you're in trouble!

01:23:55.031 --> 01:23:56.997
I know, I know. Ow.

01:23:56.999 --> 01:23:59.467
But just let me explain.

01:24:05.641 --> 01:24:07.174
It was like this...

01:24:07.176 --> 01:24:12.279
I, er, well,
the thing is...

01:24:12.281 --> 01:24:15.116
I kind of maybe stuffed up.

01:24:18.621 --> 01:24:22.456
I love you,
you old gumnut!

01:24:22.458 --> 01:24:25.392
I love you too, sweet leaf.

01:24:25.394 --> 01:24:29.196
I swear I'll never
leave home again.

01:24:29.198 --> 01:24:33.400
Anyway, Greenpatch has
got a new adventurer now.

01:24:33.402 --> 01:24:34.668
He saved us all.

01:24:34.670 --> 01:24:36.670
I had a little help.

01:24:36.672 --> 01:24:39.306
A little?

01:24:42.345 --> 01:24:44.178
Beryl, you okay, darls?

01:24:44.180 --> 01:24:47.648
Sorry. I'm not
a very good flyer...

01:24:49.452 --> 01:24:53.387
Er, hate to break up the party.
But who's steering this thing?

01:24:53.389 --> 01:24:55.589
MRS. - Paws on the wheel!

01:24:55.591 --> 01:24:57.491
Paws on the wheel!

01:24:57.493 --> 01:24:59.894
Me? I can barely
fly horizontal!

01:24:59.896 --> 01:25:01.495
Blinky! It's yours!

01:25:12.642 --> 01:25:14.975
Wacko, the Diddlo!

01:25:14.977 --> 01:25:18.045
You don't see that
every day!

01:25:19.816 --> 01:25:23.384
Whoo-hoo!
Greenpatch, here we come!

01:25:33.596 --> 01:25:35.396
My dear Goannasburgers.

01:25:35.398 --> 01:25:40.201
I am honored and deeply humbled
to be here before you today.

01:25:43.372 --> 01:25:47.508
- Now bow!
- Bow before your king.

01:25:47.510 --> 01:25:50.110
On your knees, wretches!

01:25:55.718 --> 01:25:58.953
Hello, Crankypants.

01:25:58.955 --> 01:26:02.122
William! You're alive.

01:26:02.124 --> 01:26:04.058
Ready, Blinky?

01:26:04.060 --> 01:26:07.061
Operation Goanna Splat is, go!

01:26:09.398 --> 01:26:10.998
Extraordinary!

01:30:41.036 --> 01:30:42.870
Whee!

01:30:42.872 --> 01:30:44.705
Higher, Uncle Cranky! Higher!

01:30:45.841 --> 01:30:49.543
Whee!

01:30:49.545 --> 01:30:53.380
Uh-uh! Not so fast!

01:30:53.382 --> 01:30:56.517
The kid said higher.

01:30:57.653 --> 01:30:59.486
My turn! Me!
