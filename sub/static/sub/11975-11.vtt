00:21.900 --> 00:24.233
Cute face for Mom.

00:24.233 --> 00:27.400
- Cute face for Mom.
- Cute face.

00:27.400 --> 00:29.433
Cute face.
Ooh, yes.

00:29.433 --> 00:31.433
Where did
he learn that?

00:31.433 --> 00:32.767
He just, like,
did it on his own.

00:32.767 --> 00:34.100
And then we've been
saying it, so...

00:34.100 --> 00:35.767
We were like,
"Make a cute face."

00:35.767 --> 00:37.133
...so now he, like,
will do it on command.

00:37.133 --> 00:38.800
Shake your head.
Mase, you know, we used to say

00:38.800 --> 00:40.800
that to you all the time.
"Shake your head."

00:40.800 --> 00:43.133
And then we would say,
"Say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you

00:43.133 --> 00:45.333
boot."
That was, like, when we brought

00:45.333 --> 00:47.333
you home from the hospital.
I had no idea how to treat

00:47.333 --> 00:49.000
- a kid like you.
- You put me in the

00:49.000 --> 00:50.367
garbage and then you let me
poop in it.

00:50.367 --> 00:52.133
Yeah, I should put you
in the garbage and let you

00:52.133 --> 00:54.167
poop all over the place, so I
wouldn't have to deal with it.

00:54.167 --> 00:56.367
And Mommy was like, "You better
figure this out; figure out how

00:56.367 --> 00:59.433
to handle this kid."
I was like, "I'm only 25!

00:59.433 --> 01:01.733
I don't know what to do!"

01:01.733 --> 01:04.200
- I want to yell...
- Stop it!

01:04.200 --> 01:06.200
How would I know what
to do?

01:06.200 --> 01:08.333
How?!
Tell me, man!

01:08.333 --> 01:11.800
We're gonna put him back in the
garbage can where we found him.

01:11.800 --> 01:14.833
Right in Mom's... Mom's thing,
where you came from.

01:14.833 --> 01:16.833
- Aah, Daddy!
- That's the garbage

01:16.833 --> 01:18.900
- can?
- It's the Dumpster.

01:38.267 --> 01:41.633
Let's snap before we

01:41.633 --> 01:43.733
- take off.
- Yeah, totally.

01:43.733 --> 01:45.567
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:45.567 --> 01:47.800
- How are you?
- Good, thank you.

01:47.800 --> 01:49.933
- I guess we'll sit here.
- Yeah, I'll sit

01:49.933 --> 01:51.933
- next to you.
- I am, like, so excited

01:51.933 --> 01:53.933
- to go.
- Kim, it's been a

01:53.933 --> 01:55.767
minute since we've been in Vegas
together.

01:55.767 --> 02:12.400
I'm really excited about
it.

02:12.400 --> 02:14.067
- Kimmy.
- Hi.

02:14.067 --> 02:16.133
- How was the ride?
- I'm, like, so tired now.

02:16.133 --> 02:17.833
Oh, yeah, I fell
asleep.

02:17.833 --> 02:20.100
It's, like, so annoying.
Stephanie, stand behind me,

02:20.100 --> 02:22.300
'cause the back of my dress is
not it.

02:22.300 --> 02:25.667
Like, my ass is so  huge.
I still have, like, 25 pounds to

02:25.667 --> 02:28.767
go.
The fact that I'm, like, doing

02:28.767 --> 02:30.833
appearances, like, blows my
mind.

02:30.833 --> 02:33.267
I was not even out of the house,
last time.

02:33.267 --> 02:35.700
Last time, I had, like, 50
pounds to go.

02:35.700 --> 02:39.333
I've definitely had my fair
share of the press just, you

02:39.333 --> 02:42.967
know, attacking me over things
that they think are

02:42.967 --> 02:46.100
inappropriate because I'm a mom.
Right before I got pregnant for

02:46.100 --> 02:49.167
the second time, I posted a nude
selfie.

02:49.167 --> 02:52.367
I mean, I was so proud of
myself; like, I had gotten in

02:52.367 --> 02:54.667
such great shape.
But people had such a problem

02:54.667 --> 02:58.733
- with it.
- I've watched 50

02:58.733 --> 03:00.733
things on everything about this
today.

03:00.733 --> 03:02.067
- Insane, right?
- That's the crazy

03:02.067 --> 03:03.400
- part.
- It looked like I was

03:03.400 --> 03:04.700
- wearing a bikini.
- Did Piers Morgan

03:04.700 --> 03:06.333
- respond to you?
- He wrote, like, a whole

03:06.333 --> 03:10.367
blog about why don't I try to be
successful with my clothes on.

03:10.367 --> 03:13.400
Like, why don't you try to be
successful with your clothes

03:13.400 --> 03:15.633
off?
It's actually really hard.

03:15.633 --> 03:19.000
I'll never stop posting photos
that I like of myself.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.033
If anything, I feel more
empowered.

03:21.033 --> 03:23.400
Like, if you're not into what
I'm posting, don't look.

03:23.400 --> 03:25.667
I don't pay too much attention
to it.

03:25.667 --> 03:27.567
- You look divine.
- Thank you.

03:27.567 --> 03:29.367
Is this your first...?
This is your first... yeah.

03:29.367 --> 03:31.367
Yeah, that's why they're
gonna be, like, so annoying.

03:31.367 --> 03:33.700
Ten years from now,
you're gonna be, like,

03:33.700 --> 03:36.000
"Oh, remember when I went to
Vegas?"

03:36.000 --> 03:38.600
- Totally.
- "10,000 people came

03:38.600 --> 03:40.500
to see me."

03:51.033 --> 03:54.633
This is my first real
night out since I had, you know,

03:54.633 --> 03:57.633
my baby, so it's gonna be a
fun night with all my friends.

03:57.633 --> 04:00.933
You do, like, spend so much time
prepping for a night out when

04:00.933 --> 04:04.400
you, uh, are a mom.
I was able to, you know, put my

04:04.400 --> 04:07.533
kids to bed, read them, you
know, their stories,

04:07.533 --> 04:10.933
then go out, and, you know,
make it home before they wake

04:10.933 --> 04:12.733
- up.
- Make some noise

04:12.733 --> 04:16.200
for Kim Kardashian; Kardashian
in the  right now!

04:16.200 --> 04:20.067
What's up, kids?

04:20.067 --> 04:24.233
I haven't been to Vegas for,

04:24.233 --> 04:27.833
like, years, so I'm excited.
You guys have to show me a

04:27.833 --> 04:31.000
good time.

04:45.633 --> 04:48.067
What are you looking
for?

04:48.067 --> 04:49.900
I don't know.
Just seeing what kind of snack

04:49.900 --> 04:51.533
- she has.
- How about a cookie?

04:51.533 --> 04:53.900
- I'm scared to take one.
- Okay, this is

04:53.900 --> 04:57.800
something that I rarely eat.
Kylie?

04:57.800 --> 05:00.467
- Hmm?
- I'm making myself a

05:00.467 --> 05:02.633
Pop-Tart.
Do you want one?

05:02.633 --> 05:05.033
- I'm good.
- Hey.

05:05.033 --> 05:06.867
- What are you guys doing?
- Making ourself at

05:06.867 --> 05:08.633
- home.
- Making a Pop-Tart.

05:08.633 --> 05:11.133
- Do you want one?
A Pop-Tart?

05:11.133 --> 05:13.400
- Yeah.
- You, who won't allow,

05:13.400 --> 05:16.367
like, a plastic dish in
someone's kitchen, because God

05:16.367 --> 05:18.667
forbid if it's not natural and
organic.

05:18.667 --> 05:21.333
But I'm at Kylie's
house, and she had no healthy

05:21.333 --> 05:24.000
snacks.
The only snack that sounded

05:24.000 --> 05:27.267
- appetizing to me was a Pop-Tart.
- There's fruit right

05:27.267 --> 05:29.167
- there.
- Yeah, there's lots of

05:29.167 --> 05:30.667
healthy snacks.
There's tangerines...

05:30.667 --> 05:32.700
Fine, I'll eat half
of the Pop-Tart, and then I'll

05:32.700 --> 05:34.867
eat a  pear, everyone,
so just relax.

05:34.867 --> 05:37.700
- Eat a banana.
- Okay?

05:37.700 --> 05:41.633
So, Kylie, I needed to
swing by, because I was down the

05:41.633 --> 05:43.600
street.
What's going on with the

05:43.600 --> 05:45.633
- stalker?
- He's out of the

05:45.633 --> 05:47.300
- psychiatric ward.
- I know, but...

05:47.300 --> 05:49.400
Is it the same
stalker?

05:49.400 --> 05:52.833
Yeah. It's a situation
where he didn't just get

05:52.833 --> 05:56.167
released from the psychiatric
ward, I just found out that he

05:56.167 --> 05:58.867
escaped from the psychiatric
ward.

05:58.867 --> 06:02.867
And he really thinks that he can
just keep following her around

06:02.867 --> 06:06.267
and coming to this community
and trying to get in.

06:06.267 --> 06:11.300
- How crazy is that?
- I think we take our

06:11.300 --> 06:14.167
security, like, really
seriously.

06:14.167 --> 06:19.367
Kylie has had a few incidents
with stalker-type situations in

06:19.367 --> 06:22.133
- the past.
- Oh,.

06:22.133 --> 06:24.833
- What is it?
- This isn't funny.

06:24.833 --> 06:27.967
- No, this is  nuts.
- This is really weird.

06:27.967 --> 06:29.967
"Will you marry me?"
She's 17.

06:29.967 --> 06:33.167
There has been a
guy that's been following Kylie,

06:33.167 --> 06:36.867
- and I am definitely worried.
- All right, you guys,

06:36.867 --> 06:38.433
- I'll see you later.
- I'll see you at

06:38.433 --> 06:39.933
- dinner.
- You know, we had a dog

06:39.933 --> 06:42.333
that we got, like, one of those
Forbes-trained German Shepherds.

06:42.333 --> 06:45.100
But you have to learn, like,
German commands, which you

06:45.100 --> 06:47.100
could easily learn, like, five
things in German.

06:47.100 --> 06:49.800
You need, like, a mean dog.
What do you think, Kourt?

06:49.800 --> 06:51.633
- What?
- Do you think I should

06:51.633 --> 06:55.133
get this German Shepherd?
How cool would, like, our photos

06:55.133 --> 06:59.433
be, like, of me and the dog?
I can tell the dog to sit here,

06:59.433 --> 07:03.267
- and just have the dopest photos.
- If Kylie's just so

07:03.267 --> 07:06.700
concerned that her dog's gonna
make great photos, like,

07:06.700 --> 07:09.667
she's definitely not taking this
seriously.

07:09.667 --> 07:11.667
I just think she needs to be
careful.

07:11.667 --> 07:13.533
You want to come for
me, bitch?

07:13.533 --> 07:15.000
- Come for me.
- Bring it.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.533
It would be hilarious.

07:26.767 --> 07:29.567
- Look what I have.
- Why do you have this

07:29.567 --> 07:31.567
- already?
- Because I wanted

07:31.567 --> 07:33.400
samples.
Would you like a gingerbread

07:33.400 --> 07:35.233
- cookie?
- Not really.

07:35.233 --> 07:36.833
Are you gonna see
the kids later?

07:36.833 --> 07:38.433
I got Mason new
clothes though.

07:38.433 --> 07:41.133
- So cute. Is he into it?
- I got him a bunch of

07:41.133 --> 07:43.033
vintage bombers, vintage
T-shirts.

07:43.033 --> 07:44.633
I went to that What Comes
Around Goes Around, where,

07:44.633 --> 07:46.700
- like...
- Oh, I need to, like,

07:46.700 --> 07:50.167
brace you.
Kanye is going to shoot a music

07:50.167 --> 07:54.933
video for this song "Famous."
And the people that the video's

07:54.933 --> 08:02.067
about, it's, like, Amber Rose,
Ray J, Chris Brown, Rihanna,

08:02.067 --> 08:04.400
- Taylor Swift and Caitlyn.
- Caitlyn.

08:04.400 --> 08:06.367
- Caitlyn?
- Caitlyn Jenner.

08:06.367 --> 08:09.267
There's nudity, technically.
There's sheets over everyone.

08:09.267 --> 08:12.333
I think he's obsessed
with Caitlyn though.

08:12.333 --> 08:14.967
He just, like, likes
people that do... that are

08:14.967 --> 08:17.400
authentic, that do what they
want to do.

08:17.400 --> 08:19.733
Well, he wasn't doing
what he wanted to do his whole

08:19.733 --> 08:22.267
- life.
- Yeah, but now he is.

08:22.267 --> 08:25.967
I am still trying to
understand the whole... feud

08:25.967 --> 08:29.533
between Taylor Swift and Ye that
happened about this whole song.

08:29.533 --> 08:31.600
'Cause I thought she knew about
it.

08:31.600 --> 08:35.200
She did, but she was
acting like she didn't.

08:35.200 --> 08:36.967
But didn't they--
weren't they, like, recording Ye

08:36.967 --> 08:38.900
when he was talking to her for
his, like, blog?

08:38.900 --> 08:41.200
For-- no, like, for,
like, a documentary one day.

08:41.200 --> 08:45.633
Kanye, every time he's recording
an album, he always has

08:45.633 --> 08:49.467
videographers with him 24/7,
recording everything.

08:49.467 --> 08:51.300
So Madison Square
Garden-- nobody never heard it.

08:51.300 --> 08:54.500
- It starts off Rihanna voice.
- That's the first

08:54.500 --> 08:56.533
- song you're gonna play?
- Yeah.

08:56.533 --> 09:00.433
- And then, like, whoo...
- ♪ All my South Side  that

09:00.433 --> 09:03.000
know me best
I feel like Taylor Swift might

09:03.000 --> 09:05.867
♪ owe me sex
Why? I made that bitch famous ♪

09:05.867 --> 09:09.233
♪ I made that bitch famous. ♪

09:32.800 --> 09:35.767
It's really important to
him when he was writing this

09:35.767 --> 09:39.567
song "Famous" that he, you know,
spoke to her, and they knew it

09:39.567 --> 09:43.233
was gonna be controversial.
The camera crew filmed him

09:43.233 --> 09:45.867
speaking to Taylor and got their
whole conversation.

09:45.867 --> 09:48.533
So, I think he definitely
really, you know, cared about

09:48.533 --> 09:50.867
how she felt.
I think she got freaked out by

09:50.867 --> 09:53.900
the reaction, and all of a
sudden she flipped.

09:53.900 --> 09:55.833
So many fake things
that go on.

09:55.833 --> 09:57.933
- So many fake things.
- It's just too much.

09:57.933 --> 10:01.133
- He's just over it.
- It's like, why bother?

10:01.133 --> 10:03.833
Yeah, why bother?

10:06.833 --> 10:10.433
I have to do Fergie's video.
It's about MILFs.

10:10.433 --> 10:13.367
Fergie asked me to be in the
video, and I've got to get it

10:13.367 --> 10:16.667
- together.
Kylie-- you know how

10:16.667 --> 10:19.100
she always tags her freakin'
location.

10:19.100 --> 10:21.200
Even the police
told her to stop.

10:21.200 --> 10:23.067
We really got to do
something that's gonna, like,

10:23.067 --> 10:25.967
- terrify her.
- You know someone

10:25.967 --> 10:29.000
recorded you when you were,
like, upset.

10:29.000 --> 10:36.133
- Someone has the audio.
- I don't care.

10:42.633 --> 10:46.133
- Kim, where are you?
- Hey, I'm in here.

10:46.133 --> 10:49.100
My God, look at
this place. Jesus.

10:49.100 --> 10:51.867
This is like a... this is a
store, by the way.

10:51.867 --> 10:53.933
We could open up DASH Home
Collection.

10:53.933 --> 10:56.333
That's just, like, what
I can fit me now.

10:56.333 --> 10:58.133
Wow.
What's up with you?

10:58.133 --> 11:00.267
You're, like, hiding in here.

11:00.267 --> 11:02.567
I am going over all of
my e-mails.

11:02.567 --> 11:07.233
I'm, like, so tired.
I have a cover to shoot that I

11:07.233 --> 11:09.700
think I have to go to New York
for for a day.

11:09.700 --> 11:11.800
- All right.
- It's, like, a big one.

11:11.800 --> 11:14.867
Also, I have to do Fergie's
video.

11:14.867 --> 11:18.767
- It's about MILFs.
- What are you gonna

11:18.767 --> 11:20.367
- do?
- I don't know.

11:20.367 --> 11:23.167
It's, like, she just wants,
like, her-her group of friends

11:23.167 --> 11:25.300
- in it.
- Oh, that's fun.

11:25.300 --> 11:33.367
Fergie and I have been
friends forever.

11:33.367 --> 11:36.800
We're hanging out one day, and
she was playing me her music,

11:36.800 --> 11:40.033
and I loved the song "MILF
Money," so she asked me to be in

11:40.033 --> 11:44.333
the video, and I'm so excited.
I'm so honored.

11:44.333 --> 11:47.900
It's gonna be so much fun.
I wish I had, like, a few more

11:47.900 --> 11:49.567
- months.
- You say that all

11:49.567 --> 11:52.000
the time, but you look great.
And nobody thinks you don't

11:52.000 --> 11:53.700
look great.
You're good.

11:53.700 --> 11:55.133
Now, does your butt shrink when
you lose weight?

11:55.133 --> 11:56.433
- Yeah.
- Is that what

11:56.433 --> 11:58.100
happens?
I just can't believe it shrinks

11:58.100 --> 11:59.933
- from the weight.
- Like, it goes...

11:59.933 --> 12:02.767
Yeah.
I measured it today, so...

12:02.767 --> 12:04.667
What, do you do it
by watermelons?

12:20.433 --> 12:24.200
You're a beast.
You drink tap water.

12:24.200 --> 12:26.667
- Good for you. Calabasas...
- It's not tap water.

12:26.667 --> 12:30.300
Oh, my God, okay.
Damn, girl, you rich in this

12:30.300 --> 12:32.500
house.
So, what, like, it's already

12:32.500 --> 12:34.267
- filtered?
- I don't know.

12:34.267 --> 12:37.800
The whole house has a system.

12:37.800 --> 12:39.533
- Hello.
- You sound like

12:39.533 --> 12:42.467
- Adele when you answer the phone.
- I sound like a what?

12:42.467 --> 12:44.400
- Adele.
- She doesn't know who

12:44.400 --> 12:45.933
- Adele...
- What is going on?

12:45.933 --> 12:50.033
Um, so, Kylie-- you
know how she always posts.

12:50.033 --> 12:53.433
And tags her freakin'
location.

12:53.433 --> 12:55.867
- Yeah.
- So, she, like...

12:55.867 --> 12:58.900
- Her signatures are wild.
- ...has a stalker.

12:58.900 --> 13:01.933
Even the police told her to stop
posting, and she's still doing

13:01.933 --> 13:05.067
it.
Kylie is so huge on social

13:05.067 --> 13:07.733
media.
I think she's, like, one of the

13:07.733 --> 13:10.400
most followed people on
Snapchat, which shows your

13:10.400 --> 13:14.833
location instantly.
It's just... it's not safe, and

13:14.833 --> 13:19.500
I want to make sure that, you
know, she is careful.

13:19.500 --> 13:21.833
Yeah, I remember this
guy used to show up to every

13:21.833 --> 13:24.400
appearance of mine.
And he was, like, mentally

13:24.400 --> 13:26.833
disturbed.
And it was, like, so scary.

13:26.833 --> 13:29.700
- Like, if anyone knows, we know.
- I don't think she

13:29.700 --> 13:31.267
- realizes that we know.
- It's just, there's

13:31.267 --> 13:32.800
- a way to talk to her.
- Wait, so what are you

13:32.800 --> 13:35.000
- gonna do?
- We really got to do

13:35.000 --> 13:36.833
something that's gonna, like,
terrify her, 'cause she's

13:36.833 --> 13:38.733
obviously not taking it
seriously.

13:38.733 --> 13:40.967
I feel like she'll
only learn that way.

13:40.967 --> 13:43.200
Like, she won't listen.
Like, any time we tell her

13:43.200 --> 13:45.667
anything, she wants to do the
opposite.

13:45.667 --> 13:47.333
Should we get her held
up at gunpoint and we can dress

13:47.333 --> 13:49.000
- up like...
- No.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.733
I mean us, not a real
person.

13:50.733 --> 13:52.700
No, that's too
crazy.

13:52.700 --> 14:02.433
That's the best form.

14:02.433 --> 14:04.800
Okay, I'll call you
back.

14:04.800 --> 14:06.400
- Oh, my God.
- Bye.

14:09.733 --> 14:11.667
There's new ones that I
haven't seen today.

14:14.967 --> 14:16.867
Wait.

14:19.167 --> 14:22.433
Hi.

14:22.433 --> 14:24.200
Your eyes weirdly look
big.

14:24.200 --> 14:26.467
Yeah, my eyes look
bizarre, and I think

14:26.467 --> 14:28.267
it's your phone.
Like, I thought the app was on.

14:28.267 --> 14:29.967
So that's just what my eyes look
like?

14:29.967 --> 14:31.633
Yeah.
We can't change that.

14:31.633 --> 14:35.467
There's no filter for that.

14:35.467 --> 14:37.667
- Hi.
- They have an audio

14:37.667 --> 14:41.167
- recording.
- Shut the  up.

14:41.167 --> 14:43.667
- I'm not.
- Shut the  up.

14:43.667 --> 14:47.000
Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.
It's Kanye, hold on.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.467
- Oh.
- Hey, babe.

14:48.467 --> 14:52.200
Um, so, you know someone
recorded you.

14:52.200 --> 14:53.867
- Okay.
- Um...

14:53.867 --> 14:56.100
He said, "Okay."
When you were, like,

14:56.100 --> 14:58.933
upset about Taylor.
The guy recorded the whole thing

14:58.933 --> 15:02.333
- and someone has the audio.
Uh-huh.

15:02.333 --> 15:05.367
And you just, like, are,
like, upset.

15:05.367 --> 15:08.400
I don't care.
Like, I was mad.

15:08.400 --> 15:09.933
Is that illegal for them to
record me?

15:09.933 --> 15:11.633
- Not in New York.
- See, that's what I'm

15:11.633 --> 15:13.500
- talking about.
- Not in New York.

15:13.500 --> 15:15.267
- Not in...
- Yeah, so, what-what--

15:15.267 --> 15:18.667
I mean, does it start to seem
unfair now?

15:18.667 --> 15:20.933
I mean, if you think it's a big
deal, I'm gonna follow your

15:20.933 --> 15:22.467
- lead.
- I don't think it's a big

15:22.467 --> 15:24.667
deal.
It's just the way the perception

15:24.667 --> 15:26.567
- is.
- Well, yeah.

15:26.567 --> 15:28.933
All right, let me see
what the team wants to do and

15:28.933 --> 15:32.767
says and all that.
Not that you care, but I'm just

15:32.767 --> 15:36.333
saying I care what people think.
I'm just like, my full-time job

15:36.333 --> 15:39.600
is your publicist.
Kanye definitely just always,

15:39.600 --> 15:42.467
like, speaks the truth, says
what he feels, says what he

15:42.467 --> 15:44.700
wants.
He has no filter, he just says

15:44.700 --> 15:48.033
what he, you know, believes in.
And some people might not

15:48.033 --> 15:51.333
understand that, and so, like,
he has a bad guy reputation.

15:51.333 --> 15:53.500
If you want to do
something to help it out or fix

15:53.500 --> 15:55.267
- it, I'm down.
- Maybe just, like, lay

15:55.267 --> 15:59.067
off Twitter for a little bit.
Let me see what the team says.

15:59.067 --> 16:02.533
Usually, you know, I always try
to stay neutral, and, you know,

16:02.533 --> 16:06.433
really think about where Kanye's
coming from and just, you know,

16:06.433 --> 16:09.233
definitely try to give, like,
moral support and input.

16:09.233 --> 16:11.533
Don't you think, like, I have to
think smarter for him?

16:11.533 --> 16:13.067
Mm-hmm.
- 'Cause he's gonna say,

16:13.067 --> 16:15.367
"I don't care."
The wife of Pablo?

16:15.367 --> 16:20.367
- The wife of Pablo.
- You look so good.

16:20.367 --> 16:24.933
I'm having so much fun
doing this video with the girls.

16:24.933 --> 16:26.267
We pulled your car up
here.

16:26.267 --> 16:28.133
- What's on my car?
- Uh, what is on your

16:28.133 --> 16:29.567
- car?
- Who did that to your

16:29.567 --> 16:31.733
- car. Is that your car?
- I am freaking out.

16:31.733 --> 16:38.000
Let's go look at
it.

16:45.767 --> 16:48.000
- Hi.
- Hi. How are you?

16:48.000 --> 16:49.800
- I'm great.
- Nice to meet you.

16:49.800 --> 16:51.633
- Nice to meet you.
- Oh, my goodness, who is

16:51.633 --> 16:53.867
- this?
- This is my baby.

16:53.867 --> 16:56.533
- What's his name?
- This is Beelzebub.

16:56.533 --> 17:00.600
- Hey, welcome to my world.
- This is so cool.

17:00.600 --> 17:06.467
B. Akerlund is an amazing
stylist, creative director.

17:06.467 --> 17:10.700
She is doing the Fergie video.
So cool.

17:10.700 --> 17:13.333
Love this.
I'm excited to meet with her

17:13.333 --> 17:16.867
today and, you know, just see
what her vision is for me,

17:16.867 --> 17:19.867
- 'cause I really have no idea.
- I mean, just to

17:19.867 --> 17:22.367
give you, like, a general, like,
overlook of the video, we

17:22.367 --> 17:25.900
really, like, want to, like,
lift up all the women.

17:25.900 --> 17:28.467
If it's a woman breast-feeding,
or whatever they're doing, that,

17:28.467 --> 17:30.733
I mean, they still look like
Vogue.

17:30.733 --> 17:33.000
That's, like, so been my
motto.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.900
If anything, I felt, like,
sexier after becoming a mom.

17:35.900 --> 17:38.267
I had a curvier body after
becoming a mom.

17:38.267 --> 17:40.100
You can be hot and
be a mom.

17:40.100 --> 17:42.500
That's what the whole concept is
powerful moms.

17:42.500 --> 17:45.867
And obviously you're one of
them, so we want to, you know,

17:45.867 --> 17:49.033
showcase you and, sort of--
But I could show you.

17:49.033 --> 17:52.333
So, we want you to have your own
"Got MILF" ad, which will, like,

17:52.333 --> 17:55.067
pop up on the TV.
I don't know what speaks to

17:55.067 --> 17:58.367
you the most as a person.
Like, if you had to explain

17:58.367 --> 18:00.900
yourself in, like, three words
what would it be?

18:00.900 --> 18:02.767
I hate describing
myself, but...

18:02.767 --> 18:04.967
I mean, I would definitely say
sexy is one of them.

18:04.967 --> 18:06.900
Mm-hmm.
- And I think, if I were

18:06.900 --> 18:11.067
to do an ad like this, like, I
like the ones when the girls

18:11.067 --> 18:13.833
are, like, wet and, like,
dripping milk on them, and,

18:13.833 --> 18:15.267
- like, that vibe.
- Okay.

18:15.267 --> 18:16.900
Should be in the
shower.

18:16.900 --> 18:18.800
Like, should we do
a swimsuit?

18:18.800 --> 18:20.800
- Yeah, I think so.
- Like, a special

18:20.800 --> 18:22.100
- swimsuit that...
- Yeah.

18:22.100 --> 18:23.367
...sucks everything
in.

18:23.367 --> 18:24.867
Do whatever you want
with me.

18:24.867 --> 18:26.500
- Okay.
- You know, just make me

18:26.500 --> 18:29.767
look skinny.

18:29.767 --> 18:32.300
Meeting with B., I definitely
know that I'm in really good

18:32.300 --> 18:34.600
hands.
Like, she's got it.

18:34.600 --> 18:38.033
Her references were insane.
What she's planning on having,

18:38.033 --> 18:40.833
you know, custom-made is just
gonna look so good.

18:40.833 --> 18:43.933
So I feel like this is gonna
be so major.

18:43.933 --> 18:46.767
I'm-I'm really getting excited
now.

18:46.767 --> 18:49.133
- Hello.
- Hi.

18:49.133 --> 18:52.767
- Hey.
- I'm, like, obsessing.

18:52.767 --> 18:55.833
I know.
It's gonna be so fun.

18:55.833 --> 18:58.800
Well, you are in good hands with
B.

18:58.800 --> 19:01.300
Uh, I can't wait to see what you
guys come up with.

19:01.300 --> 19:03.433
- It's gonna be so good.
- She'll take the milk

19:03.433 --> 19:05.833
shower, you'll take the milk
bath.

19:05.833 --> 19:07.500
Okay, perfect.

19:07.500 --> 19:08.933
- Yes.
- Perfect.

19:08.933 --> 19:11.333
- Okay.
- Well, we'll get in a

19:11.333 --> 19:23.167
bath together.

19:23.167 --> 19:25.800
What are you gonna
get?

19:25.800 --> 19:28.400
- Salad?
- I have no idea if they

19:28.400 --> 19:30.167
- have anything else.
- They do.

19:30.167 --> 19:32.067
I mean, they have, like,
sandwiches and stuff.

19:32.067 --> 19:35.133
I used to get a tuna sandwich
once in a while.

19:35.133 --> 19:39.467
Okay, so while we're
at lunch, we're basically trying

19:39.467 --> 19:41.333
to teach Kylie, like, a lesson.

19:41.333 --> 19:44.000
And Kim-- I swear to God.
Oh, it's Kim, speak of the

19:44.000 --> 19:47.167
devil.
Hey.

19:47.167 --> 19:49.100
Hey.
So, Steph is gonna come and

19:49.100 --> 19:50.933
- she's gonna set it all up.
- Oh, my God, that's

19:50.933 --> 19:52.767
amazing.
Okay, we'll be there distracting

19:52.767 --> 19:54.567
- her.
- It'll be so good.

19:54.567 --> 19:57.033
- So good.
- Because Kylie has

19:57.033 --> 20:02.000
been so casual about this
security issue, my sisters and I

20:02.000 --> 20:06.800
decide to do a little prank on
her to give her a wake-up call.

20:06.800 --> 20:09.467
I think Kylie needs to
understand that this is not a

20:09.467 --> 20:11.967
- joke.
- We're gonna make sure,

20:11.967 --> 20:14.400
like, when we walk out with her,
that we think, like...

20:14.400 --> 20:15.900
That we're like...

20:15.900 --> 20:17.433
- Like it's serious.
- And, like, make it

20:17.433 --> 20:19.767
a serious thing, instead of
being like, "Ha-ha-ha-ha."

20:19.767 --> 20:21.567
Right. She's not
gonna know, at this point,

20:21.567 --> 20:24.533
- that it's us doing it.
- Yeah, we got to, like,

20:24.533 --> 20:27.100
scare her into it.
She needs to take this

20:27.100 --> 20:29.300
- seriously.
- Agreed.

20:29.300 --> 20:33.600
I don't think it's a bad idea to
play a harmless prank on Kylie.

20:33.600 --> 20:36.800
Hi. What a cute bag.
And hopefully, kind of scare her

20:36.800 --> 20:39.067
a little.
I think just showing Kylie how

20:39.067 --> 20:43.500
easy it is to reach her might,
like, rattle her up a little

20:43.500 --> 20:45.333
- bit.
- Are you buying

20:45.333 --> 20:47.567
- horny goat weed extract?
- Yeah.

20:47.567 --> 20:50.067
Mm-hmm.
- Horny goat weed

20:50.067 --> 20:52.367
- extract-- what is this?
- Yeah, I saw...

20:52.367 --> 20:54.467
I saw "horny" and I
got excited.

20:54.467 --> 20:56.667
And then I saw "goat."
"Goat" made me

20:56.667 --> 20:58.167
- really excited.
- Yeah.

20:58.167 --> 21:07.067
And the "extract" part, yeah.
Oh.

21:07.067 --> 21:10.767
- Cute.
- I'm not surprised

21:10.767 --> 21:15.767
Kylie is Snapchatting and not
concerned about our location

21:15.767 --> 21:18.800
being known.
And so this is exactly why we're

21:18.800 --> 21:20.633
- doing the prank.
- Okay, Kourt, we got

21:20.633 --> 21:26.667
- to go.
- Okay.

21:26.667 --> 21:28.467
- Ky... where's Kylie?
- Say what?

21:28.467 --> 21:30.367
Oh.

21:31.967 --> 21:33.867
This way.

21:36.500 --> 21:38.267
Right over here.

21:38.267 --> 21:40.300
- My car? You moved it?
- Uh, Kourtney, we pulled

21:40.300 --> 21:42.433
- your car up here.
- What's on my car?

21:42.433 --> 21:46.100
Uh, what is on your
car?

21:46.100 --> 21:48.733
Who did that to your
car? Is that your car?

21:48.733 --> 21:51.000
Oh, my God.
I have no idea what's going on.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.333
I am freaking out.
I'm just gonna wait till they

21:53.333 --> 21:54.867
- take it off.
- Come here.

21:54.867 --> 21:56.900
- Let's go look at it.
- Why?

21:56.900 --> 21:59.067
'Cause, let's go
see what it is.

21:59.067 --> 22:02.267
- You only live once.
- No, you guys did this.

22:02.267 --> 22:04.967
It was nothing
about us.

22:04.967 --> 22:08.233
Very funny.
I can't really understand why

22:08.233 --> 22:12.333
Kourtney would do this.
The paparazzi are definitely

22:12.333 --> 22:15.867
gonna release these photos.
It's embarrassing.

22:15.867 --> 22:26.433
Kylie.
Kylie.

22:26.433 --> 22:29.300
- So Kourt.
- Huh?

22:29.300 --> 22:33.567
What were you saying
about  fast?

22:33.567 --> 22:36.733
I said some guys
jerk it, so they can last

22:36.733 --> 22:38.667
- longer.
- Yeah, but I don't

22:38.667 --> 22:40.167
think there's anything wrong
with that.

22:40.167 --> 22:42.033
I'm not saying
there is at all.

22:42.033 --> 22:43.933
We're going to Hef's
at 12:30.

22:43.933 --> 22:46.700
What do you do if you
bump into Taylor Swift tonight?

22:46.700 --> 22:49.067
I don't know Taylor
Swift; why do I care?

22:49.067 --> 22:51.167
Call Kim.

22:51.167 --> 22:54.667
Okay.

22:54.667 --> 22:57.067
Hi.
Uh, whatever happened with the

22:57.067 --> 22:59.767
- Taylor Swift video?
- The clip is so good.

22:59.767 --> 23:03.700
So the line, when she said, "I
made her famous," or whatever,

23:03.700 --> 23:06.467
I heard she told everyone at the
table, like, "Well, I mean, it's

23:06.467 --> 23:08.633
true, whatever.
Kanye totally, like, made me

23:08.633 --> 23:12.633
more famous."
And so that's what Kanye came

23:12.633 --> 23:15.233
- up with the line, but whatever.
- So why don't you...?

23:15.233 --> 23:16.600
I'll put it out.
What's wrong with you?

23:16.600 --> 23:18.333
Yeah, but it's
like, why-- I don't know.

23:18.333 --> 23:20.867
'Cause, like, why do you even
want to get into this battle?

23:20.867 --> 23:23.067
I just wanted to, like,
kind of stay out of it.

23:23.067 --> 23:25.200
Don't let Khloe
post it.

23:25.200 --> 23:27.167
No, don't.
I don't want any of us to get

23:27.167 --> 23:28.833
- involved.
- Yeah.

23:28.833 --> 23:38.333
- Okay, bye.
- Kourt, come here.

23:38.333 --> 23:42.067
I don't really feel like saying
much, because the Taylor Swift

23:42.067 --> 23:44.933
fans love her, and I'm all for
that.

23:44.933 --> 23:48.300
And all I know is, I saw the
video.

23:48.300 --> 23:52.000
I heard Taylor, and I think that
Kanye did the right thing.

23:52.000 --> 23:55.033
So please Taylor Swift fans,
don't kill me.

23:55.033 --> 23:56.500
Who did your
makeup?

23:56.500 --> 24:00.233
That's not okay.
I know how it is when people

24:00.233 --> 24:03.200
are, like, attacking your
husband, and I know that Kim

24:03.200 --> 24:04.867
feels that Kanye did the
right thing.

24:04.867 --> 24:06.967
You don't have to do that as a
songwriter.

24:06.967 --> 24:08.767
You could really just say
whatever you want.

24:08.767 --> 24:11.367
It's so easy to just go ahead
and attack Kanye, 'cause they

24:11.367 --> 24:13.567
already perceive him in a
negative way anyway.

24:13.567 --> 24:17.800
I really hate that he gets such
a bad rap for everything.

24:17.800 --> 24:21.433
I mean, what do you think about
the video?

24:21.433 --> 24:23.833
It's just
funny.

24:23.833 --> 24:27.233
- Everyone's so full of.
- So full of

24:27.233 --> 24:29.167
that it pisses me off.

24:30.800 --> 24:33.700
- Three, drop, good.
- I've got to get it

24:33.700 --> 24:37.067
together, and get myself in
shape for this "MILF Money"

24:37.067 --> 24:39.700
- music video.
- Yeah, come on, come on.

24:39.700 --> 24:41.500
What is going on with
Kylie?

24:41.500 --> 24:43.767
She felt, like, really
disrespected.

24:43.767 --> 24:45.500
Well, we were
trying to get her to take it

24:45.500 --> 24:47.333
- seriously.
- Well, maybe there was a

24:47.333 --> 24:49.500
better way to show her that.

25:00.533 --> 25:02.667
- Hello, Don.
- How your body feeling?

25:02.667 --> 25:04.700
Fine, but you know my
quad.

25:04.700 --> 25:06.733
- Right.
- We got to just see.

25:06.733 --> 25:09.700
Mm-hmm.
Mind right, body ready.

25:09.700 --> 25:13.700
Mentally zone in, focus.
I'm gonna start doing the, uh,

25:13.700 --> 25:16.233
upper body with me.
So just cushion down, when

25:16.233 --> 25:18.367
the arms go down, light jump.
Let's go.

25:18.367 --> 25:21.567
One, drop.
Two, perfect.

25:21.567 --> 25:24.700
Three, drop.
Good, four.

25:24.700 --> 25:27.433
That's the pace I want.
Five, don't speed that up. Six.

25:27.433 --> 25:30.433
I've got to get it
together, and get myself in

25:30.433 --> 25:32.900
shape for this "MILF Money"
music video.

25:32.900 --> 25:36.600
I'm really nervous though.
But if Chrissy can do this, and

25:36.600 --> 25:41.133
she had a baby two weeks ago,
I definitely can get it

25:41.133 --> 25:44.067
together, like, four months
later.

25:44.067 --> 25:46.933
Four, cushion.
Five, cushion.

25:46.933 --> 25:49.767
Let's go.
One, drop, up.

25:49.767 --> 25:52.467
Two, drop.
Squeeze the arms.

25:52.467 --> 25:55.000
- Good.
- You know, with Kim,

25:55.000 --> 25:59.133
she just, like, you know, puts
being a mom first, but she takes

25:59.133 --> 26:05.333
time to work out, eat well and
just feel her best.

26:05.333 --> 26:07.300
Oh, the roll down.
Let me see this.

26:07.300 --> 26:09.667
- Let's see it.
- I remember those days.

26:09.667 --> 26:18.933
- Good job!
- Yeah. Come on, come on.

26:18.933 --> 26:21.200
- Hey.
- Hi.

26:21.200 --> 26:23.333
Hi, Reigny.
What are you doing?

26:23.333 --> 26:27.300
Give me a little kiss.
Show me the face.

26:27.300 --> 26:29.633
Did he do it?

26:29.633 --> 26:31.833
Yes.
You're so cute.

26:31.833 --> 26:35.167
How come you're so cute?
Show me the face.

26:35.167 --> 26:38.367
Your mama used to do that.
Yeah.

26:38.367 --> 26:43.900
You're so cute.
So what is going on with Kylie?

26:43.900 --> 26:46.933
She was so upset.
Called me, hysterical, crying.

26:46.933 --> 26:50.100
Said she never wanted to go out
and hang out with you guys

26:50.100 --> 26:52.867
again, because she felt, like,
really disrespected.

26:52.867 --> 26:54.633
And then we were
walking out to the car.

26:54.633 --> 26:58.367
It just was a bad day.
There was so many people around,

26:58.367 --> 27:01.333
so many paparazzi, and so I
think she was just like, "What's

27:01.333 --> 27:03.733
going on?" and then I was like,
"Come on, let's go to your car

27:03.733 --> 27:05.567
and see it."
You know, I think she's

27:05.567 --> 27:10.300
just young still and trying to
do so much, and she's got so

27:10.300 --> 27:14.633
much on her plate.
It's still a really new, big

27:14.633 --> 27:17.867
world for her because she just
turned 18, so she's got this

27:17.867 --> 27:20.567
world of responsibility that
she's trying to get used to.

27:20.567 --> 27:22.367
One of the things that's
stressing her out, and she

27:22.367 --> 27:24.800
doesn't really talk about it at
all, is the whole stalker

27:24.800 --> 27:28.833
situation.
She's had to change her whole

27:28.833 --> 27:32.167
computer system, she's had to up
her security, hire more

27:32.167 --> 27:36.333
bodyguards and get a new phone.
It's a lot to go through when

27:36.333 --> 27:39.800
someone starts threatening your
existence and just the way you

27:39.800 --> 27:42.133
live your life.
Everything had to change.

27:42.133 --> 27:44.200
Well, we were
trying to get her to take it

27:44.200 --> 27:47.333
- seriously, so hopefully she is.
- Well, maybe there was a

27:47.333 --> 27:52.133
- better way to show her that.
- I do feel bad that

27:52.133 --> 27:57.300
our idea to teach Kylie about
posting her location, you know,

27:57.300 --> 27:59.867
it kind of freaked her out,
especially with so many people

27:59.867 --> 28:02.800
around.
Everything about it went wrong.

28:02.800 --> 28:07.700
And so, clearly, that was not
the best idea.

28:07.700 --> 28:10.367
I just want you guys to
watch out for her because she is

28:10.367 --> 28:13.933
the baby, and just be sensitive
to, you know, the fact that

28:13.933 --> 28:15.833
- she's still growing up.
- Yeah.

28:15.833 --> 28:18.933
Next time just get some
Silly String and call it a day.

28:18.933 --> 28:20.833
Mm, sure.

28:26.267 --> 28:28.800
- Hello.
- Oh, my God, you're

28:28.800 --> 28:32.200
getting skinnier and skinnier.
Don't eat those cookies.

28:32.200 --> 28:35.633
You won't-- you don't need--
like, you look so good.

28:35.633 --> 28:37.333
Here, I'll split the
difference.

28:37.333 --> 28:39.200
I don't want it.
Why-- that's how I know you're

28:39.200 --> 28:41.300
not a real friend.
Real friends don't give friends

28:41.300 --> 28:43.600
Vienna wafers.

28:43.600 --> 28:45.800
I'm so nervous about the
Fergie video.

28:45.800 --> 28:48.400
It's, like, called "MILF Money."
So it's gonna be, like, us,

28:48.400 --> 28:51.300
like, walking with the big pram
strollers, like, down the street

28:51.300 --> 28:54.200
in this neighborhood, and I'm
gonna be in, like, a "Got MILF"

28:54.200 --> 28:56.500
ad, and then there's, like, a
diner, and then there's, like, a

28:56.500 --> 28:58.933
- beauty salon, and...
- How cool.

28:58.933 --> 29:01.000
There's, like, different
scenes, all with MILFs.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.100
Well, you definitely
are a MILF right now.

29:03.100 --> 29:06.067
- What other MILFs are in it?
- Chrissy Teigen.

29:06.067 --> 29:08.700
Oh, duh.
That's fun that you guys all get

29:08.700 --> 29:10.467
- to do that.
- Um, yeah, it'll be

29:10.467 --> 29:13.733
really fun, but I have, like,
such anxiety.

29:13.733 --> 29:15.833
You're really a crazy
person.

29:15.833 --> 29:18.100
You look so good.
I think better than you did

29:18.100 --> 29:21.967
- before you had kids.
- I definitely am not at

29:21.967 --> 29:25.800
my weight goal yet, but since
Fergie and I were friends before

29:25.800 --> 29:30.400
we had kids, and now our kids
are friends and have playdates,

29:30.400 --> 29:34.733
we totally get the mom struggle.
We get how hard it is to really

29:34.733 --> 29:37.833
work out and feel good about
yourself again.

29:37.833 --> 29:42.500
So I'm proud to be a part of
her, like, mom MILF pack and

29:42.500 --> 29:45.133
music video.
I love the, like, message behind

29:45.133 --> 29:48.200
it, and I would never miss it
for the world.

29:48.200 --> 29:51.000
I mean, I think it's just, like,
we both, like, think it's, like,

29:51.000 --> 29:55.267
super empowering to, you know,
have kids and then, like, still

29:55.267 --> 30:00.467
be a hot, sexy MILF, you know?
There's, like, the mommy-moms

30:00.467 --> 30:02.000
- though that, like...
- Kourtney, at first,

30:02.000 --> 30:03.533
- was the mommy-mom.
- Totally.

30:03.533 --> 30:05.967
After Reign, she's
like, "I'm gonna be a MILF."

30:05.967 --> 30:07.600
- Totally. She's a MILF.
- Thank God. I thought

30:07.600 --> 30:10.533
- we lost her to the mommy-moms.
- Yeah, me, too.

30:10.533 --> 30:12.767
I'm gonna FaceTime her
again.

30:12.767 --> 30:15.400
So I just have a

30:15.400 --> 30:19.033
The first time I
FaceTimed you, was your phone

30:19.033 --> 30:21.033
- near you?
- No, I didn't know

30:21.033 --> 30:23.633
FaceTimed me. When?

30:23.633 --> 30:25.800
I like your acting
abilities; you're good.

30:25.800 --> 30:27.900
It was honest.
What are you doing?

30:27.900 --> 30:31.767
Looking at this MILF.
Seriously, she looks so good.

30:31.767 --> 30:33.533
- No joke.
- That is not a good

30:33.533 --> 30:36.533
- angle, sorry.
- It's all good.

30:36.533 --> 30:38.467
- Well, she...
- No, she's the

30:38.467 --> 30:41.000
ultimate MILF.
She looks amazing, but that--

30:41.000 --> 30:44.267
and I'm just keeping it real--
that angle was not what's up.

30:44.267 --> 30:54.400
- Um...
- Love you. Got to go.

30:54.400 --> 30:58.067
Hey.
So do you-- yeah, do you want

30:58.067 --> 31:01.100
hair up in, like, the rollers,
or do you want it, like, softly

31:01.100 --> 31:05.300
- out and then we tie the bandana?
- We need va-va-voom.

31:05.300 --> 31:08.933
We need pinup.
Should we give her a moosh?

31:08.933 --> 31:10.233
A little
beauty mark?

31:10.233 --> 31:11.900
Chrissy has normal
hair and makeup.

31:11.900 --> 31:14.133
I think we should, like,
try to, like, really make it

31:14.133 --> 31:16.800
look normal Kate Moss-y hot.
Vogue.

31:16.800 --> 31:18.867
Your brand.
Just be concerned about your

31:18.867 --> 31:21.800
- brand.
- Like, thank God Kanye is

31:21.800 --> 31:26.400
here, because he definitely says
what's on his mind, and he's

31:26.400 --> 31:28.833
definitely not feeling the,
like, blonde wig with the red

31:28.833 --> 31:30.933
lips.
I'm actually, like, happy that

31:30.933 --> 31:33.267
he even said something, 'cause I
wouldn't have had the balls to.

31:33.267 --> 31:35.100
So should we
just do our own thing?

31:35.100 --> 31:40.167
I think so.
GQ.

31:40.167 --> 31:44.400
And she was like, "What about
when Kanye said him and Taylor

31:44.400 --> 31:47.467
might still have sex?"
I just don't care really anymore

31:47.467 --> 31:55.067
and I'm gonna say how I feel.
So wild.

32:03.767 --> 32:05.400
Walking up,
walking up.

32:05.400 --> 32:07.867
Make a hole guys, coming in.
Make a hole, please.

32:07.867 --> 32:10.100
- Hi, babe.
- Hi.

32:10.100 --> 32:13.400
How are you?
You look so good.

32:13.400 --> 32:15.567
You look so good.

32:15.567 --> 32:17.333
- Oh, yeah.
- Is that the diva Chrissy

32:17.333 --> 32:19.533
- over there?
- Yeah.

32:19.533 --> 32:22.267
- Such a diva.
- I know.

32:22.267 --> 32:24.167
She's been giving  all
day.

32:25.600 --> 32:27.200

Good stuff.

34:35.267 --> 34:51.267
- Bye.
- Yup.

34:51.267 --> 34:54.200
Cosmo
interview coming up.

34:54.200 --> 34:56.267
Do you get nervous for
them?

34:56.267 --> 34:59.033
I never did.
I'm like, "Why do I care?"

34:59.033 --> 35:02.533
Yeah, who cares?
GQ.

35:02.533 --> 35:04.100
- How was it?
- It was good.

35:04.100 --> 35:07.967
She asked me questions like
Rob and Chyna, random O.J.

35:07.967 --> 35:10.633
questions that no one really
asks me, but maybe 'cause that

35:10.633 --> 35:13.200
show came out.
My publicist is gonna die.

35:13.200 --> 35:18.167
She asked me how do I feel when
Kanye, like, raps about having

35:18.167 --> 35:21.567
- sex with other girls.
Mm-hmm.

35:21.567 --> 35:22.967
GQ.

35:27.667 --> 35:30.667
The interviewer straight
up asks me, like, how do I feel

35:30.667 --> 35:37.933
that Kanye talked about having
sex with Taylor Swift.

35:37.933 --> 35:40.733
I kind of just was really
truthful and said how I felt.

35:40.733 --> 35:44.133
I never talk  about
anyone, like, publicly, like,

35:44.133 --> 35:48.000
especially in interviews, but I
was just like, "I've so had it."

35:48.000 --> 35:50.600
I just felt like I wanted to,
like, defend him in it.

35:50.600 --> 35:53.700
Mm-hmm.
- 'Cause it's like, she

35:53.700 --> 35:58.967
legitimately...
quote, says, "As soon as I get

35:58.967 --> 36:02.467
on that Grammy red carpet, I'm
gonna tell all the press, like,

36:02.467 --> 36:04.633
I was in on it."
And then she just

36:04.633 --> 36:08.200
- didn't like the reaction?
- Yeah, and, you know,

36:08.200 --> 36:10.900
just another way to play the
victim.

36:10.900 --> 36:13.833
Definitely got her a lot of
attention the first time.

36:13.833 --> 36:16.767
I just don't think that he
should be punished for it still

36:16.767 --> 36:20.267
to this day.
I feel like I've had it with

36:20.267 --> 36:23.700
people blatantly treating my
husband a certain way and making

36:23.700 --> 36:26.500
him look a certain way.
Kanye is always so honest and

36:26.500 --> 36:29.700
speaks his mind, and, you know,
when we were first dating,

36:29.700 --> 36:32.300
everyone would talk  and
he always had my back.

36:32.300 --> 36:34.467
At this point, I really don't
give a , so I'll do

36:34.467 --> 36:37.900
whatever to protect my husband.
Yeah, Kanye, you know,

36:37.900 --> 36:42.433
definitely, like, hurt her years
ago when he did that, and it

36:42.433 --> 36:45.300
wasn't meant to be personal.
It could've been anyone.

36:45.300 --> 36:48.367
'Cause, like, we all know that
"Single Ladies" was the biggest

36:48.367 --> 36:50.700
- song of the year.
- Yeah.

36:50.700 --> 36:53.700
So I think when she
didn't win, he just wanted to

36:53.700 --> 36:56.667
- stand up for it.
- I'm so glad that

36:56.667 --> 36:59.767
- you said the truth.
- Yeah, I'm just, like,

36:59.767 --> 37:02.833
speaking the truth.
Like, he called her, spoke to

37:02.833 --> 37:04.567
her.
She even helped him, like,

37:04.567 --> 37:06.733
- rewrite.
- Yeah.

37:06.733 --> 37:12.100
- It's so wild.
- What if you just called

37:12.100 --> 37:13.900
- Taylor up?
- I'm just over it.

37:13.900 --> 37:16.533
At this point, like, I know the
truth.

37:16.533 --> 37:18.500
- Thank you for your advice.
- You're welcome.

37:18.500 --> 37:25.000
But I'm not gonna take
it.

37:31.967 --> 37:35.367
You are so gorgeous.

37:35.367 --> 37:38.900
I'm so lavender.
Is my boob hanging out the

37:38.900 --> 37:40.200
- bottom?
- You are so

37:40.200 --> 37:41.600
- gorgeous.
- You look so cute.

37:41.600 --> 37:43.000
No filter?
You didn't...

37:43.000 --> 37:44.600
I put a filter on it,
you freak.

37:44.600 --> 37:46.167
Oh, thank God.
I love your hair.

37:46.167 --> 37:47.867
- Is my boob hanging out?
- No.

37:47.867 --> 37:50.800
- I think lavender's your color.
- I think white's

37:50.800 --> 37:53.933
- your color.
- What's going on?

37:53.933 --> 37:55.467
Um...

37:55.467 --> 37:58.700
I just wanted to apologize for
that prank.

37:58.700 --> 38:00.167
Mm-hmm.
- I just don't think

38:00.167 --> 38:04.033
that we realized, like, what a
scene-- I feel like we should've

38:04.033 --> 38:06.567
known the second we got there,
and there was, like, thousands

38:06.567 --> 38:08.467
- of people outside.
- It was just too many

38:08.467 --> 38:09.933
- people.
- It was too much to

38:09.933 --> 38:12.200
do that, so we should've, like,
stopped it.

38:12.200 --> 38:14.900
The restaurant to the
car situation when there's too

38:14.900 --> 38:17.467
many fans and paparazzi is
already stressful.

38:17.467 --> 38:18.900
And then the
balloons, and the guy was

38:18.900 --> 38:21.633
videoing, and then, like, you
just, like, weren't sure, like,

38:21.633 --> 38:24.833
who was in on it.
Like, it was just too much.

38:24.833 --> 38:29.800
So, I just wanted to say sorry,
but I think it is, you know,

38:29.800 --> 38:32.833
important to, like, take it
seriously with the stalker.

38:32.833 --> 38:35.933
My new thing is, like, if I'm
out public with the snapping,

38:35.933 --> 38:39.333
like, I'll turn to airplane mode
and then you post them later.

38:39.333 --> 38:43.800
I always do that.
I take it seriously.

38:43.800 --> 38:45.967
Good,
yes, good.

38:45.967 --> 38:49.733
I'm just not trying to
be, like, a hermit my whole

38:49.733 --> 38:52.333
life, you know?
They can't stop me.

38:52.333 --> 38:54.600
We can't be scared of these
things.

38:54.600 --> 39:01.367
But I appreciate you being
concerned and apologizing.

39:01.367 --> 39:05.133
Even though Kylie
is my younger sister, she's 18

39:05.133 --> 39:08.233
years old.
I think sometimes we do forget

39:08.233 --> 39:12.100
she is a mature adult.
We don't give her enough credit.

39:12.100 --> 39:15.800
She is really smart, and I
realize she wouldn't put herself

39:15.800 --> 39:18.767
in a dangerous situation.
She's being cautious, and I'm

39:18.767 --> 39:20.667
really proud of her.

39:22.767 --> 39:26.467
- Ah, this angle.
- Oh, it's a video.

39:42.867 --> 39:44.667
- Hi. Hi.
- Where you going?

39:44.667 --> 39:46.300
- You're going to London?
- For the day.

39:46.300 --> 39:48.267
- Why?
- Because Kendall had a

39:48.267 --> 39:51.867
really awful night last night
flying to Paris, 'cause she gets

39:51.867 --> 39:55.467
- really bad panic attacks.
- Oh, come on.

39:55.467 --> 39:57.633
- And anxiety.
- Seriously.

39:57.633 --> 39:59.300
I don't know what to
do.

39:59.300 --> 40:01.733
Wait, isn't it so funny
that people think Saint, like,

40:01.733 --> 40:04.200
doesn't exist or something's
wrong with him 'cause I don't

40:04.200 --> 40:06.500
- show pictures of him?
- I need to come over--

40:06.500 --> 40:09.833
you need to move back here.
Enough is enough.

40:09.833 --> 40:11.533
- Relax.
- No, I am.

40:11.533 --> 40:15.667
I'm loving life.
Oh, my God, with Taylor Swift's

40:15.667 --> 40:17.500
- team...
- How did this all start

40:17.500 --> 40:20.533
- up again anyway?
- Just because I did an

40:20.533 --> 40:23.600
GQ.
that's sitting

40:23.600 --> 40:25.533
- right there?
- Yeah.

40:25.533 --> 40:27.200
Thanks, you didn't read the
article.

40:27.200 --> 40:29.067
- No.
- Well, if you had, you

40:29.067 --> 40:32.800
- would've known.
- What would happen if

40:32.800 --> 40:37.367
you just called Taylor up?
And just say, "What-- just,

40:37.367 --> 40:47.633
you know, what happened?
How did this go so south?"

40:47.633 --> 40:50.633
How did this all start
up again anyway?

40:50.633 --> 40:54.267
Just because I did an
GQ.

40:54.267 --> 40:55.967
that's sitting
right there?

40:55.967 --> 40:58.167
Yeah.
Thanks, you didn't read the

40:58.167 --> 40:59.733
- article.
- No.

40:59.733 --> 41:01.800
Well, if you had, you
would've known.

41:01.800 --> 41:06.400
What would happen if
you just called Taylor up?

41:06.400 --> 41:09.567
And just say, "What-- just,
you know, what happened?

41:09.567 --> 41:13.133
How did this go so south?"
I just, this is what I don't

41:13.133 --> 41:17.500
understand, because truly I
really do like her, and I really

41:17.500 --> 41:20.233
like her team, and I really like
her mom.

41:20.233 --> 41:25.867
I guess I don't understand the
motivation to...

41:25.867 --> 41:28.433
- flip so quickly.
- Me neither, especially

41:28.433 --> 41:32.633
'cause Kanye went, like, so far.
Like, no rapper is gonna call

41:32.633 --> 41:35.033
someone that they're, like,
rapping about and get their

41:35.033 --> 41:36.567
- permission.
- Yeah.

41:36.567 --> 41:38.600
Like, he really wanted
to just, like, because they've

41:38.600 --> 41:41.333
had their issues in the past,
like, he really did want to do

41:41.333 --> 41:43.000
- the right thing.
- And be respectful.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.933
Maybe she just took it the wrong
way.

41:45.933 --> 41:48.133
I mean, at this point,
I'm just over it.

41:48.133 --> 41:52.067
Like, yeah, am I annoyed that
people try to pin my husband as

41:52.067 --> 41:54.900
this bad guy to, like, take
advantage a little bit?

41:54.900 --> 41:59.300
But, at this point, like, I know
the truth, I know everyone

41:59.300 --> 42:02.333
around me knows the truth, we
all do, so it is what it is.

42:02.333 --> 42:04.600
You know, there's nothing we can
really do about it.

42:04.600 --> 42:09.500
My advice is that you
give Taylor a call and try to

42:09.500 --> 42:11.133
- make amends.
- Thank you for your

42:11.133 --> 42:13.333
- lovely advice.
- You're welcome.

42:13.333 --> 42:18.100
But I'm not going to
take it.

42:18.100 --> 42:20.600
Keeping Up with the
Kardashians...

42:20.600 --> 42:22.067
Are you excited for
Cuba?

42:22.067 --> 42:23.900
It feels like we're
in a dream.

42:23.900 --> 42:26.233
Dorothy, you're not in
Canada anymore.

42:26.233 --> 42:28.800
- Canada?
- Hey, Kylie.

42:28.800 --> 42:31.233
- You look so cute and pretty.
- All my sisters are in

42:31.233 --> 42:33.633
Cuba, and she doesn't know what
to do with herself.

42:33.633 --> 42:35.433
Mom, you're acting a
little crazy.

42:35.433 --> 42:37.333
- Okay.
- He was, like, waiting

42:37.333 --> 42:39.633
for me to leave town.
I've been trying to contact

42:39.633 --> 42:43.700
Lamar, but I am unable to.
Definitely makes me nervous.
