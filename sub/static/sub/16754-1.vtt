36:22.347 --> 36:24.932
You're like a crocodile--
fat crocodile, fat bastard.

36:25.016 --> 36:27.935
You're like fucking Idi Amin, you know what I mean?

36:28.019 --> 36:32.022
Stay here? You should be
ashamed of yourself.

36:33.400 --> 36:36.360
Who do you think you are?

36:36.444 --> 36:38.487
King of the castle?

36:38.572 --> 36:40.573
Cock of the walk?
[Grunts]

36:42.701 --> 36:45.369
What, you think this is the wheel of fortune?

36:45.453 --> 36:48.706
You think you can just
make your dough and fuck off,
leave the table?

36:48.790 --> 36:50.708
"Thanks, Don.
See ya, Don.

36:50.792 --> 36:53.002
Off to sunny Spain now.
Fuck off, Don."

36:53.086 --> 36:57.298
You lie in your pool like
a fat blob laughing at me.
You think I'm gonna have that?

36:57.382 --> 37:00.759
Do you really think I'm gonna have that, ya ponce?

37:00.844 --> 37:03.888
All right, I'll make it easy for you.

37:05.557 --> 37:08.058
God, you're fucking trying.

37:08.143 --> 37:11.312
Are you gonna do the job?

37:11.396 --> 37:15.149
It's not a difficult question.
Yes or no?

37:15.275 --> 37:17.443
Don--
Say it.

37:18.987 --> 37:22.406
No.
Yes. Fuck off, wanker.
You're doing it.

37:29.664 --> 37:33.125
Know what I've noticed?
You know what stands out
crystal clear?

37:33.209 --> 37:35.294
You haven't asked about anybody.

37:35.378 --> 37:38.923
Everyone's always asking
after you. "How's Gal?
Heard from him?"

37:39.007 --> 37:42.301
"No, not for a while."
"Is he all right?"

37:42.385 --> 37:44.929
Leaves me wondering,
"Have I done something
to upset him?"

37:45.013 --> 37:48.182
Must have. I'll ask him.
Have I done something
to upset you?

37:48.308 --> 37:50.601
Of course not.
Meaning?

37:50.727 --> 37:54.605
Well, you haven't.
You were born in Britain.
You're not a fucking Spaniard.

37:54.731 --> 37:58.067
Don't kid yourself.
You look like a laughingstock.
[Tires Skidding]

38:04.115 --> 38:07.034
What's that?
[Goat Bleating]

38:07.118 --> 38:09.453
It's a goat.

38:09.537 --> 38:11.789
They're a fucking nuisance.

38:11.873 --> 38:14.291
What's it looking at me for?

38:14.376 --> 38:18.128
Don, the steak was enormous.

38:18.213 --> 38:20.172
Size of it.
Couldn't finish it.

38:23.385 --> 38:26.303
And he were nice,
weren't he?
The waiter.

38:26.388 --> 38:28.555
Oh, yeah, very attentive.

38:30.725 --> 38:32.559
He liked you, Deedee, didn't he?

38:32.644 --> 38:36.814
- Liked you.
- He's got good taste.

38:36.898 --> 38:38.357
[Aitch]
Handsome fucker, weren't he?

38:38.441 --> 38:40.526
Bloody Adonis.

38:40.610 --> 38:43.570
- Wasn't very expensive.
- You sound nice on
the phone, Jack.

38:45.323 --> 38:48.075
Nice telephone voice.

38:50.203 --> 38:52.579
Sound like you work in an office.

38:55.959 --> 38:58.335
You ever worked in an office?

38:58.420 --> 39:00.337
No.

39:00.422 --> 39:02.256
No?

39:05.260 --> 39:07.219
Nice telephone voice.

39:09.305 --> 39:11.598
I've worked in an office.

39:12.809 --> 39:16.687
I was 17.
Does that surprise you?

39:16.771 --> 39:18.897
What, that you were 17?

39:24.446 --> 39:26.530
You got very nice eyes, Deedee.

39:26.614 --> 39:29.116
Never noticed them before.

39:29.200 --> 39:31.618
They real?

39:34.122 --> 39:37.958
- I'll get us all a drink, eh?
- I'll give you a hand.

39:43.339 --> 39:46.759
He's staying the night.
Have you told him?

39:47.969 --> 39:51.013
Have you told him?
Yeah, I've told him.

39:51.097 --> 39:53.057
And?

39:53.141 --> 39:55.350
Well, it's not that simple.

39:55.435 --> 39:58.020
Did you know he fucked Jackie?

39:58.104 --> 40:00.064
Yeah.

40:03.526 --> 40:06.320
[Footsteps Receding]

40:08.698 --> 40:11.033
What the fuck was she playing at?

40:11.117 --> 40:13.577
[Aitch]
This is a fuckin' nightmare.

40:13.661 --> 40:15.996
The man's a fuckin' nightmare.

40:16.081 --> 40:18.916
All right, then, what'd he say?

40:19.000 --> 40:20.959
You told him?

40:21.044 --> 40:23.337
He knows.

41:58.183 --> 42:00.142
[Turns Faucet On]

42:02.604 --> 42:04.897
I shouldn't have told him that.

42:04.981 --> 42:07.024
I shouldn't have said anything there.

42:07.108 --> 42:09.693
Where? Back there in the bar,
about Jackie.

42:09.777 --> 42:11.904
Jackie the Paki.

42:11.988 --> 42:13.906
What, Gal?
He's all right.

42:13.990 --> 42:17.034
Still giving too much
of yourself away, mate.
Fucking mouth.

Big mouth.
Fucking big mouth,

You all right, mate?

42:48.274 --> 42:50.192
Don't look it.

What, that cunt through there?

43:03.873 --> 43:07.167
Is he insulting you?
What's he said to you?
It's all right, mate.

43:07.252 --> 43:09.753
You can tell me.

43:09.837 --> 43:11.755
He said that?

43:14.217 --> 43:16.260
Just like that?
No.

43:16.344 --> 43:20.514
That lump of shit said that?
Expects you to take that?
Just swallow that?

What, does he think you're a cunt?

I'll sort him out for you.
That's no problem.

agrees with her.
Still game for a laugh?

you could have had,
and you had to pick her.

but he's still operatin'

45:56.504 --> 45:59.840
I won't let you be happy!
Why should I?

46:01.592 --> 46:04.511
- Friday. The Grosvenor.
You'll be there.
- I won't.

You will.
I told Ted you're doing it.
Don't you show me up.

- No, I won't be there.
- You will.

Yes, Roundtree.

- No, Don.
- Friday!

- I won't be there.
- You will!

- No, Don.
- Yes! Yes! Yes!
Yes! Yes!

46:21.863 --> 46:25.615
Don, let's... stop
kidding ourselves, eh?

46:25.700 --> 46:29.161
We both know the reason
you're here, and it's not
just because of me.

46:33.624 --> 46:35.125
What did you say?

46:35.209 --> 46:37.335
It's not just because of me.

46:37.420 --> 46:39.045
What are you talking about?

46:39.130 --> 46:42.132
You didn't come here to--

just because of me.

This is astounding.

[Snorts]
Repeat.

46:54.979 --> 46:56.897
Let's be honest.

46:58.983 --> 47:01.276
This is about Jackie.

47:13.748 --> 47:16.166
I come over here...

47:16.250 --> 47:18.168
for professional reasons, nothing else.

47:18.252 --> 47:20.170
On a professional mission.

47:20.254 --> 47:22.589
I've gotta get
a team together.
Gotta handpick a team.

47:22.673 --> 47:25.091
And I have you in mind for that team.

47:25.176 --> 47:27.093
But, quite frankly, your attitude appalls me.

47:27.178 --> 47:28.678
It's not what you're saying.

47:28.763 --> 47:32.265
It's all the stuff
you're not saying.
"Insinnuendos."

47:32.350 --> 47:34.935
You really are demonstrating
some whopping great ego,
my friend!

47:35.019 --> 47:37.187
I'd keep that in check if I were you!

47:37.271 --> 47:40.524
'Cause that sort of
big-headedness can be
a right turnoff!

47:40.608 --> 47:43.527
If you don't want to do
the job, fair enough!
I can accept that!

47:43.611 --> 47:45.529
We'll leave it at that.

47:45.613 --> 47:49.157
And considering what I know
about you and the outrageousness
of what's inside of your head,

47:49.242 --> 47:51.326
whatever stinking thoughts you're having,

47:51.410 --> 47:55.330
which I don't want to know 'cause they're so disgusting!

47:58.626 --> 48:01.336

Fucking hell!

48:01.420 --> 48:05.006

this minute, please.

48:42.211 --> 48:44.588
Sir, I'm afraid you can't smoke.

48:44.672 --> 48:46.548
What?
What do you want?

48:46.632 --> 48:48.883
Your cigarette.
You have to
put it out.

48:48.968 --> 48:52.053
Cigarette? What, this?
No, I'm not gonna put it out.

48:52.138 --> 48:54.055
You must.
Why's that?

48:54.140 --> 48:57.058
If you don't, we can't take off.

48:57.143 --> 48:59.894
Well, that's your problem, isn't it?

48:59.979 --> 49:01.938
It's your move.

49:03.524 --> 49:06.443
- I'm afraid you can't--
- No, I'm not gonna put it out.

49:06.527 --> 49:09.446
You're just gonna have to
wait till I've finished it.
Simple as that.

49:11.032 --> 49:14.409
Why don't you just put the cigarette out?

49:14.493 --> 49:17.287
[Chuckles]
What's that, Sancho?

49:17.371 --> 49:20.123
You want me to cut your hands off, use it as an ashtray?

49:20.207 --> 49:24.419
Yeah, I'll put it out, providing
you're prepared to let me
stub it out on your eyeball.

49:24.503 --> 49:26.463
I'll put it out.
Agreeable?

49:27.923 --> 49:29.883
No.

Here come the gay brigade.
Look. [Chuckles]

49:37.308 --> 49:40.143
I'll tell you what.
I'll get off the plane.

49:40.227 --> 49:43.563
You happy with that?
I'm happy with that.

49:43.648 --> 49:45.565
I'll smoke it outside.

49:47.401 --> 49:49.402
Open the door.
[Bell Dinging]

49:50.446 --> 49:52.364
I hope this crashes.

49:52.448 --> 49:54.407
Open the fucking door!

50:07.213 --> 50:09.422
[Door Opens]

50:15.930 --> 50:18.098
This is very serious,
Mr. Logan.

50:18.182 --> 50:22.102
You're right, sir.
It's very serious.
I've been here for five hours.

50:22.186 --> 50:24.604
As you may know, all European airlines--

50:24.689 --> 50:28.108
Before you start,
I wanna say something.
Let me ask you something.

50:32.488 --> 50:34.406
Have you ever been sexually assaulted?

50:34.490 --> 50:37.409
No, neither have I, until today, on that plane.

50:37.493 --> 50:39.411
What?
Yeah, that's what I said.

50:39.495 --> 50:42.372
There's me putting my bag up in the cupboard.

50:42.456 --> 50:45.375
Next thing you know,
I feel hands on me.
Someone's touched me.

50:45.459 --> 50:48.169
Touched my front--
my front bottom.

50:48.254 --> 50:50.880
I can't believe it.
I've gone all cold.
I look round.

50:50.965 --> 50:55.635
He's standin' there,
that steward with
the guilty look on his face.

50:55.720 --> 50:57.721
I was shocked.
I didn't know what to say.

50:57.805 --> 51:00.223
I had to sit down, I was that perturbed.

51:00.307 --> 51:04.894
And then his mate, the other one
who was giving lessons on what
we do if we land in the sea,

51:04.979 --> 51:07.397
how to wear your life jacket, et cetera,

51:07.481 --> 51:10.400
he starts looking at me all funny, suggestive.

51:10.484 --> 51:13.111
Now, I don't know
whether they wanted me
for a two's-up or something,

51:13.195 --> 51:14.904
I don't know how they work it.

51:14.989 --> 51:16.906
But I tell you what, it scared me.

51:16.991 --> 51:18.908
I was shaking like a leaf.

51:18.993 --> 51:22.412
So, without thinking,
I lit up a cigarette
to calm me nerves.

51:22.496 --> 51:25.415
I was tremblin'.
I was very emotional.

51:25.499 --> 51:29.961
That's when
all the rest of it happened.
It's very regrettable.

51:30.045 --> 51:33.715
Now, I don't want to
kick up a fuss. Right?

51:33.799 --> 51:36.718
Press charges, contact the British embassy.

51:36.802 --> 51:38.720
I'd rather not pursue those channels.

51:38.804 --> 51:41.639
It's not my style.
