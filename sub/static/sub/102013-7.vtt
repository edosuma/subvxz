The case, what...

09:19.475 --> 09:21.310
Um, alleged ghost abduction.

09:21.352 --> 09:22.728
Ghost abduction.
See, that would've been, like,

09:22.770 --> 09:24.063
my third guess.

09:26.649 --> 09:29.068
The infamous Murder Room.

09:29.110 --> 09:32.530
And it's all ours
until 12:00 p.m. today.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.532
Lucky us.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.826
Every year, we book this room
for the weekend

09:36.867 --> 09:38.411
and do initiation here.

09:38.452 --> 09:41.080
Isabel did it on Friday,
and nothing happened.

09:41.122 --> 09:43.749
Nothing ever happens
except we freak ourselves out.

09:43.791 --> 09:45.835
Plenty to freak out about.

09:45.876 --> 09:47.378
Three people died
in this room.

09:47.420 --> 09:48.879
Four, actually.

09:48.921 --> 09:51.799
Legend says, when
the hotel claims a new victim...

09:51.841 --> 09:54.468
Blood weeps from
the walls. I know.

09:54.510 --> 09:56.887
But that's just stories.

09:56.929 --> 09:59.724
Oh, the windows
only open two inches now.

09:59.765 --> 10:01.142
In the '70s,
people who stayed here

10:01.183 --> 10:03.352
were so overcome by despair,

10:03.394 --> 10:04.729
they kept jumping out.

10:04.770 --> 10:08.190
Sure, but this security rod

10:08.232 --> 10:10.484
on the window is bent.

10:10.526 --> 10:14.363
Jennifer didn't get taken
by a ghost. She ghosted you.

What happened?

10:25.499 --> 10:26.959
Did you cut your hand?

10:28.127 --> 10:30.838
This is not my blood.

10:30.880 --> 10:33.049
Oh, man.

10:34.342 --> 10:38.054
This is feeling
less alleged.

If one of the spirits
took Jennifer,

10:40.389 --> 10:43.392

Well?

10:53.819 --> 10:56.280
Yo, please, please tell me
you found something.

10:56.322 --> 10:57.865
You've had Tiffany's drive
for two weeks.

10:57.907 --> 10:59.241
It's not good, man.

10:59.283 --> 11:00.868
I mean, I always knew

11:00.910 --> 11:03.746
that my father wasn't
exactly aboveboard, but...

11:03.788 --> 11:05.539
I cross-referenced the drive

11:05.581 --> 11:08.542
with some files that I found
in the Hudson vault, and...

11:08.584 --> 11:10.795
I don't think that the
was the first time

11:10.836 --> 11:12.380
he's killed in business.

11:12.421 --> 11:14.507
I don't think it was
the last, either.

11:14.548 --> 11:16.342
But that is good.

11:16.384 --> 11:17.593
Th-That's what we need.

11:17.635 --> 11:19.428
Yeah, but it's not enough.

11:19.470 --> 11:21.305
Now, I'm connecting some dots,
but I don't have everything.

11:21.347 --> 11:24.350
I need to get access
to his offshore accounts.

11:24.392 --> 11:25.768
Okay, so you're
following the money.

11:25.810 --> 11:27.353
That's smart.

11:27.395 --> 11:29.605
Problem is, is that his
private wealth manager

11:29.647 --> 11:31.691
won't give me access, so now
I got to find another way

11:31.732 --> 11:33.401
to go around and
get the records.
Wait, wait, wait.

11:33.442 --> 11:34.819
You called Everett's
wealth manager?

11:34.860 --> 11:37.071
Does your dad know?
No.

11:37.113 --> 11:39.782
I mean, I... I don't know.

11:39.824 --> 11:41.575
Yeah, yeah, but could
this guy tell Everett

11:41.617 --> 11:42.993
you were asking
to get access?

11:43.035 --> 11:44.370
If your father realizes

11:44.412 --> 11:46.664
you're poking around
in his secrets...

11:46.706 --> 11:48.541
Okay, we-we,
we got to get ahead of him

11:48.582 --> 11:50.459
before he figures out
what we're doing.

11:50.501 --> 11:51.752
Hey, hey,
where you going?

11:51.794 --> 11:53.003
I'm going to get some advice.

11:53.045 --> 11:54.255
Do not get
cold feet on me.

11:54.296 --> 11:55.464
Listen, just trust me

11:55.506 --> 11:57.591
a little while longer, please.

11:57.633 --> 11:59.510
(door closes, engine starts)

12:00.469 --> 12:03.347
(tires screech)

12:04.974 --> 12:06.225
If we can narrow down
which spirit took her,

12:06.267 --> 12:07.727
it could help us figure out how.

12:07.768 --> 12:09.979
Maybe the, uh,
Crying Child.

12:10.020 --> 12:11.313
Or the Woman in Red.

12:11.355 --> 12:13.023
She wants a companion.

12:13.065 --> 12:14.066
Mm, keep looking.

12:14.108 --> 12:15.693
ISABEL:
"4.5 stars:

12:15.735 --> 12:16.902
"Ghostly chains
rattled for hours.

12:16.944 --> 12:18.738
Didn't sleep a wink.
Best trip ever."

12:18.779 --> 12:21.282
"Five stars: Slept all through
a hot summer night in room 413."

12:21.323 --> 12:23.576
ISABEL (laughs):
Sounds so nice.

12:23.617 --> 12:25.411
We had to be on campus
in August for volleyball.

12:25.453 --> 12:27.413
It was deadly.

12:27.455 --> 12:29.707
The AC barely works
in my dorm.

12:29.749 --> 12:32.418
When did, uh, when did
your semester start?

12:35.504 --> 12:38.966
Let's just focus
on the haunted hotel, okay?

12:39.008 --> 12:40.509
It says the place
was a private mansion.

12:40.551 --> 12:43.053
A bunch of people died
just building it.

12:43.095 --> 12:44.972
I thought it was always a hotel.
Yeah, I did, too.

12:45.014 --> 12:48.225
Apparently, the original
servants' bell system,

12:48.267 --> 12:50.686
on display in the hotel bar.

12:50.728 --> 12:52.354
Oh.
So cool.

12:52.396 --> 12:53.856
It's like
Downton Abbey.

12:55.357 --> 12:56.692
You know what?

12:56.734 --> 12:58.903
I have to go back to the hotel.

12:58.944 --> 13:01.071
Uh, no way, we can't
go back there.

13:01.113 --> 13:02.531
A ghost already
got one of us.

13:02.573 --> 13:04.116
Okay.

13:04.158 --> 13:09.079
Uh... can you stay
with them?

13:09.121 --> 13:10.956
I just don't want to leave
three scared strangers

13:10.998 --> 13:12.208
alone in my house.

13:12.249 --> 13:13.751
I'll text Bess and George.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.002
Nancy.

13:15.044 --> 13:17.296
Downton Abbey.

13:17.338 --> 13:19.131
(door closes)

13:19.173 --> 13:20.800
♪ ♪

13:27.264 --> 13:29.934
Hey, hey, hey.
Here, let me help.

13:29.975 --> 13:31.685
Are you all right?

13:31.727 --> 13:34.313
It's just you've been,
you've been so tired lately.

13:34.355 --> 13:37.566
Please. The bags under your eyes
could carry groceries.

13:39.318 --> 13:41.362
I mean, sorry. I'm-I'm...

13:41.403 --> 13:43.364
Seriously, I'm fine.

13:43.405 --> 13:46.867
I just had a bug,
but now I got rid of it.

13:46.909 --> 13:48.786
Okay.

14:01.340 --> 14:03.467
(gasps)

14:03.509 --> 14:05.678
Menteuse.

14:09.098 --> 14:10.140
George.

14:11.600 --> 14:13.018
You okay?

14:14.520 --> 14:16.689
Bess, I...
(phone buzzing)

14:17.648 --> 14:19.191
Oh, it's Nancy.

14:19.233 --> 14:22.444
She needs us to meet her
at the Breaker Hotel ASAP.

14:22.486 --> 14:24.321
Something about
a missing college student?

14:24.363 --> 14:26.031
Okay.

14:26.991 --> 14:28.242
Okay.

14:30.077 --> 14:32.872
I'll deal with you later.

14:40.713 --> 14:43.132
(exhales)

14:44.842 --> 14:47.011
So, I need to undo my
grandfather's will.

14:47.052 --> 14:49.471
Wait. Give me a dollar.

14:49.513 --> 14:51.682
To reengage my services.

14:51.724 --> 14:54.184
Okay. Yeah, um...

14:55.769 --> 14:58.647
Let's see, I've got, uh...

14:58.689 --> 15:00.733
All I got is 50s.

15:02.693 --> 15:05.362
(sighs)
Fine. Here.

15:06.322 --> 15:07.698
Congratulations.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.491
You have attorney-client
privilege again.

15:09.533 --> 15:11.660
Thank you.

15:11.702 --> 15:14.580
So, my grandfather,
he founded Hudson Enterprises.

15:14.622 --> 15:17.207
He-he wanted it to be run
like a monarchy,

15:17.249 --> 15:18.834
so the corporate structure is...

15:18.876 --> 15:21.086
It's laid out in his will.
Right. Exactly.

15:21.128 --> 15:24.590
After my grandfather, the
company passes down to my father

15:24.632 --> 15:26.926
and my uncle, Josiah.

15:26.967 --> 15:29.053
Fifty-fifty split.

15:29.094 --> 15:32.431
But Josiah, he drank himself
into an early grave, so...

15:32.473 --> 15:35.851
By the way, that's why
my father's so messed up.

15:35.893 --> 15:37.895
So Everett got full control
of Hudson Enterprises,

15:37.937 --> 15:40.814
and if he dies, as I recall,

15:40.856 --> 15:42.650
or is otherwise unable
to continue as CEO,

15:42.691 --> 15:44.944
then Hudson Enterprises
goes to you,

15:44.985 --> 15:47.237
unless you trigger
the forfeiture clause

15:47.279 --> 15:51.325
by making a move against
Hudson Enterprises or its CEO,

15:51.367 --> 15:53.661
in which case
you get cut off entirely,

15:53.702 --> 15:56.497
and the company goes
to your heir.

15:56.538 --> 15:58.415
And that's the part
that I want to undo.

15:58.457 --> 16:01.043
Well, your grandfather
is deceased,

16:01.085 --> 16:03.253
which means his will
can't be changed.

16:03.295 --> 16:04.797
Yeah, okay, but
the problem is,

16:04.838 --> 16:07.841
is that I have an heir
now-- right, Nancy--

16:07.883 --> 16:10.719
and she's the reason that
he's on trial for murder.

16:10.761 --> 16:12.137
He hates her for that.

16:12.179 --> 16:13.847
If he finds out that
I tried to trigger

16:13.889 --> 16:15.933
this forfeiture clause...
Okay, hang on.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.810
The last time we spoke
about your dad,

16:17.851 --> 16:19.812
you were staying
on the sidelines.

16:19.853 --> 16:21.605
What changed?

16:21.647 --> 16:23.607
Are you making
a move against him?

16:23.649 --> 16:25.567
It's possible I am.

16:25.609 --> 16:27.194
And if I do,

16:27.236 --> 16:29.822
and if Hudson Enterprises
gets passed down to Nancy,

16:29.863 --> 16:32.157
she's gonna burn that place down
before anybody can stop her,

16:32.199 --> 16:34.368
and Everett knows that.

16:34.410 --> 16:37.162
And if Everett finds out
who Nancy really is...

16:37.204 --> 16:38.789
He would destroy her.

16:38.831 --> 16:41.250
One phone call.

16:41.291 --> 16:42.876
That's how he does it.

16:42.918 --> 16:45.295
I mean, he'll have her dying
in some mysterious accident.

16:45.337 --> 16:47.297
That's how he does it--
it-it doesn't matter

16:47.339 --> 16:50.134
if he's in jail or if he's on
the moon, he'll make it happen.

16:50.175 --> 16:52.970
Okay, then whatever it is
you're planning,

16:53.012 --> 16:55.723
whatever would trigger
the forfeiture clause,

16:55.764 --> 16:57.266
don't do it.

16:57.307 --> 16:59.977
I might have already done it.

17:00.019 --> 17:02.479
There's a chance that I...

17:02.521 --> 17:05.482
might not be able
to cover my tracks.

17:07.484 --> 17:10.320
(sighs)

17:10.362 --> 17:14.158
Then there's only one option.

17:14.199 --> 17:17.536
Make sure Everett
never finds out about Nancy.

17:17.578 --> 17:19.079
Ever.

17:23.959 --> 17:26.086
Everyone who stayed here
in the winter

17:26.128 --> 17:28.589
complained that no matter how
much they turned the heat up,

17:28.630 --> 17:30.549
it was always drafty.

17:30.591 --> 17:33.218
BESS:
Well, yeah, that makes sense
then, doesn't it? Ghosts.

17:33.260 --> 17:36.513
Also Maine, winter.
old-ass building, cold.

17:36.555 --> 17:38.140
And everyone who stayed
in this room in the summer

17:38.182 --> 17:40.184
said how beautifully cool
it was.

17:40.225 --> 17:42.519
Yeah. Ghosts.

17:42.561 --> 17:45.064
Also, again, Maine, ocean,
air-conditioning.

17:45.105 --> 17:47.107
Ghosts cannot be your go-to
for everything. Stop.

17:47.149 --> 17:49.902
Or a draft from a hidden door.

17:49.943 --> 17:51.570
Ace said that the hotel
was originally built

17:51.612 --> 17:54.406
as a family home,
and what do rich families have?

17:54.448 --> 17:55.699
If you say ghosts
one more time...

17:55.741 --> 17:58.577
No. Uh, I was going
to say servants.

17:58.619 --> 18:00.621
But back then, families
didn't want their guests

18:00.662 --> 18:02.456
to see their maids and butlers
coming and going,

18:02.498 --> 18:05.709
so they built servants'
corridors and hidden doors

18:05.751 --> 18:07.920
so that the staff could access
most to the building

18:07.961 --> 18:11.173
while remaining
relatively unseen.

18:11.215 --> 18:12.883
Yeah, the Marvin Estate
has a drawing room

18:12.925 --> 18:15.552
modeled after the Queen's
White Drawing Room,

18:15.594 --> 18:17.596
but it has a servants'
hidden door.

18:17.638 --> 18:19.014
Why does that not surprise me?

18:19.056 --> 18:21.016
I mean, it's kind of like this,

18:21.058 --> 18:22.976
but way more expensive,

18:23.018 --> 18:26.396
and it has, like,
a latch behind the...

18:26.438 --> 18:27.981
(clicking)

18:28.023 --> 18:30.150
(hinges creaking)
(gasps)

18:30.192 --> 18:31.860
No way.
(gasps): Oh, my God.

18:31.902 --> 18:33.821
Are you kidding me?

18:33.862 --> 18:35.489
Thank you, Bess Marvin,

18:35.531 --> 18:38.075
and thank you, Queen Elizabeth.

18:38.117 --> 18:40.202
Our pleasure.

18:40.244 --> 18:44.081
So, we-we gotta
go in there, right?

18:44.123 --> 18:45.833
Yeah.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.503
Okay, we're going in now.

18:51.463 --> 18:53.674
(hinges creaking)

18:53.715 --> 18:54.925
(clicks)

18:54.967 --> 18:56.844
(knocking)

18:56.885 --> 18:58.262
Hey, I got your SOS.

18:58.303 --> 18:59.763
What's up?
Is that Nancy?

18:59.805 --> 19:01.265
Did she find Jen?
What did she say?

19:01.306 --> 19:02.766
Oh, I'm-I'm just
gonna text her.

19:02.808 --> 19:04.643
Can anyone make an omelet?

19:05.602 --> 19:07.354
Never mind.

19:07.396 --> 19:09.815
They were really scared
about their friend

19:09.857 --> 19:11.650
being kidnapped by a ghost,
so I told them

19:11.692 --> 19:13.193
about all the ghosts
that we've dealt with.

19:13.235 --> 19:14.862
Now they feel...

19:14.903 --> 19:16.530
a lot better.

19:16.572 --> 19:18.782
Help me.

19:25.497 --> 19:28.083
(groans): Oh, that's
the longest hallway ever.

19:28.125 --> 19:31.253
It must run behind every room.
Uh...

19:34.047 --> 19:36.175
GEORGE:
All that's missing
are the pervy peepholes,

19:36.216 --> 19:39.386
and this hotel is officially
my worst nightmare.

19:41.847 --> 19:44.183
(electrical buzzing)

19:46.059 --> 19:47.686
Do you hear that?

19:49.605 --> 19:51.523
Ooh.
(scoffs)

19:51.565 --> 19:53.400
(sighs heavily)

19:55.152 --> 19:57.196
(quietly):
Awesome.

20:01.491 --> 20:02.993
That's a piece
of Jennifer's shirt.

20:03.035 --> 20:06.580
Isabel sent me a picture of her
from last night.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.501
Whoa.

20:20.135 --> 20:22.179
What's at the bottom
of the shaft?

20:22.221 --> 20:23.639
GEORGE:
Dumbwaiter.

20:23.680 --> 20:25.515
Looks very broken.

20:28.352 --> 20:30.604
What if Jennifer
was running, scared,

20:30.646 --> 20:33.649
and then she jumped into
the dumbwaiter to hide,

20:33.690 --> 20:35.317
and the whole thing crashed
into the basement?

20:35.359 --> 20:37.736
And nobody heard?

20:37.778 --> 20:39.613
Oh, well, maybe whatever
she was running from did.

20:39.655 --> 20:42.491
Uh, or she's still
down there, trapped, hurt.

20:42.532 --> 20:45.369
Either way, we need
to get to the basement now.

20:50.582 --> 20:52.292
Jennifer?

20:53.543 --> 20:55.545
Perfect. The lights are broken.

20:55.587 --> 20:57.673
(exhales)

21:25.075 --> 21:26.326
She was here.

21:26.368 --> 21:27.536
GEORGE:
She couldn't
have gotten out

21:27.577 --> 21:28.578
from over here.

21:28.620 --> 21:29.746
It's locked from the outside in.

21:29.788 --> 21:31.164
Just like the door
we came through.

21:31.206 --> 21:33.333
She couldn't have
gotten out that way, either.

21:43.885 --> 21:45.762
(gasps)

21:45.804 --> 21:47.055
Blood.

21:47.097 --> 21:49.141
Blood? Where?
Yeah.

21:57.816 --> 22:01.320
What if this doesn't have
anything to do with ghosts?

22:01.361 --> 22:04.698
What if someone is using the
hotel's history as a way to...

22:04.740 --> 22:07.617
Mm, kidnap and
murder people?

22:07.659 --> 22:09.786
Secret access to rooms.

22:09.828 --> 22:13.332
Old legends of-of missing guests
written off as ghost stories?

22:13.373 --> 22:14.541
Wait. Tapes,

22:14.583 --> 22:16.335
of victims screaming?

22:16.376 --> 22:18.295
I mean...

22:19.796 --> 22:21.423
Hey!
(screaming)

22:21.465 --> 22:22.758
You shouldn't be in here.

22:30.015 --> 22:31.308
(grumbles)

22:32.225 --> 22:34.561
He caught us.

22:34.603 --> 22:36.188
(whispers):
That is the hotel owner.

22:36.229 --> 22:37.856
(whispers):
You mean hotel murderer.

22:40.233 --> 22:42.694
Hi! Oh, God,
I'm so glad you're here.

22:42.736 --> 22:44.488
Thank God. We...

22:44.529 --> 22:46.156
We got so lost.

22:46.198 --> 22:48.116
Lost?
We were so lost,

22:48.158 --> 22:49.409
because it was so dark.

22:49.451 --> 22:50.702
(whispers):
Stop overselling it.

22:50.744 --> 22:52.245
Yeah. Okay.

22:56.875 --> 22:58.960
Come on, Nancy.

23:00.295 --> 23:01.588
Excuse you.

23:01.630 --> 23:03.173
Oh.

23:03.215 --> 23:04.591
Wait. Hold on.

23:04.633 --> 23:05.801
So we can give him
a second chance

23:05.842 --> 23:07.219
to murder us and
drain our blood?

23:07.260 --> 23:08.720
No, thank you, Nancy.

23:08.762 --> 23:10.222
He is not a killer.

23:10.263 --> 23:11.765
Mr. Holmes would've
locked us in that room

23:11.807 --> 23:13.266
if he was a killer.

23:13.308 --> 23:15.185
I've seen that logo before.

23:15.227 --> 23:17.646
I saw Mr. Holmes talking
to the butcher this morning.

23:17.687 --> 23:20.982
The blood is from
Frank's Butcher Shop on Main.

23:21.024 --> 23:22.484
The chains are for rattling
behind the walls

23:22.526 --> 23:24.403
in the servants' passage,
and the scream tapes

23:24.444 --> 23:26.947
are not from victims,
they are sound effects.

23:26.988 --> 23:28.448
Oh, my God.

23:28.490 --> 23:30.450
That guy's a freaking genius.
Think about it.

23:30.492 --> 23:32.327
Horseshoe Bay's
two biggest tourist draws

23:32.369 --> 23:33.995
are lobster rolls and ghosts.

23:34.037 --> 23:36.248
People come to this hotel
because they want to be scared.

23:36.289 --> 23:38.708
I'm willing to bet
nobody was ever murdered here.

23:38.750 --> 23:41.211
Maybe one or two natural deaths
became old legend,

23:41.253 --> 23:42.921
so they capitalized on it.

23:42.963 --> 23:46.675
But our hotel owner was guilty
of faking a haunting.

23:46.716 --> 23:48.343
I don't think
that he hurt Jennifer.

23:48.385 --> 23:50.679
Okay, but how can
we be so sure?

23:50.720 --> 23:52.389
There was a camera
in the basement.

23:52.431 --> 23:53.849
It's where they keep
their liquor for the hotel bar,

23:53.890 --> 23:55.392
so they're required
to have a security feed.

23:55.434 --> 23:56.893
If we can get ahold
of that footage,

23:56.935 --> 23:59.104
we can find out
what happened to Jennifer.

23:59.146 --> 24:01.857
(clatters)
(groans) Come...

24:07.195 --> 24:08.780
Hi.

24:08.822 --> 24:11.116
You're about to ask me
for something, aren't you?

24:11.158 --> 24:15.120
I am. There is a security camera
in your basement.

24:15.162 --> 24:17.998
I was wondering
if I could get my hands

24:18.039 --> 24:19.833
on the tapes from last night.

24:19.875 --> 24:22.252
I would if I could, but the boss
password-protects that stuff.

24:22.294 --> 24:24.754
And sadly, I'm a thief,
not a hacker.

24:24.796 --> 24:26.965
Oh, but I can get you
a discount on a room

24:27.007 --> 24:28.300
or some minibar snacks.

24:28.341 --> 24:29.718
That's okay.

24:29.759 --> 24:31.219
Though I do know someone
who could help you

24:31.261 --> 24:32.596
with your computer woes.

24:33.889 --> 24:35.223
Oh, Zoe--

24:35.265 --> 24:37.559
You don't cook
pancakes in the oven.

24:37.601 --> 24:39.394
Who raised you?

24:40.812 --> 24:42.355
Really?
(phone chimes)

24:42.397 --> 24:43.899
Is that Nancy?

24:43.940 --> 24:45.233
NICK:
Uh, no.

24:46.151 --> 24:47.319
Son of a...

24:47.360 --> 24:48.445
(phone chimes)

24:48.487 --> 24:50.405
Nancy?
Uh, yes.

24:50.447 --> 24:52.324
Did she find Jennifer?
What'd she say?

24:52.365 --> 24:54.034
ZOE:
Which ghost was it?

24:54.075 --> 24:55.535
Nick, Nancy
needs me.
(alarm sounds)

24:55.577 --> 24:58.288
So I'm gonna, I'm gonna go!
You have fun.

24:58.330 --> 25:00.790
Ace? Ace, no. Don't you...
Don't you dare.

25:00.832 --> 25:02.167
Ace, don't--

25:02.209 --> 25:04.377
Ace, please don't go.
Please. God...

25:05.962 --> 25:07.339
Somebody ask
for a friendly

25:07.380 --> 25:08.924
neighborhood computer guy?

25:08.965 --> 25:10.592
Please, kind sir, help me.

25:10.634 --> 25:12.886
What's the problem?
Uh, it keeps
freezing,

25:12.928 --> 25:15.430
and percussive maintenance
hasn't helped.

25:19.184 --> 25:20.644
Uh... Uh... yeah.

25:20.685 --> 25:22.062
You know what?
Actually, I'm gonna...

25:22.103 --> 25:24.189
Sorry.

25:29.110 --> 25:31.446
You know, I'm just gonna
run a debugging program

25:31.488 --> 25:34.199
and do a hard reboot.
It'll only take a sec.

25:34.241 --> 25:37.202
Oh. That quick?

25:41.081 --> 25:43.041
I can type more slowly...

25:43.083 --> 25:45.210
if you want.

25:45.252 --> 25:47.254
I mean...

25:47.295 --> 25:49.130
I wouldn't mind.

25:50.298 --> 25:54.052
Ace finally uploaded the hotel
security footage to our FTP.

25:54.094 --> 25:57.430
You and Ace have
a private server?

25:57.472 --> 25:59.766
The teammates said
that the hazing started

25:59.808 --> 26:01.935
at the top of the witching hour.

26:06.439 --> 26:08.733
(gasps)
Yikes.

26:12.612 --> 26:14.489
Wait. Wait.
What is that?

26:22.539 --> 26:24.165
Wait. Who is that?

26:29.462 --> 26:31.548
George?

26:44.978 --> 26:46.896
You need to explain
right now.

26:46.938 --> 26:48.898
Okay, I was trying to find the
right time to tell you guys,

26:48.940 --> 26:50.900
but I... I didn't
want to worry anyone,

26:50.942 --> 26:52.777
and I thought that I could
take care of it, and then I did,

26:52.819 --> 26:54.404
and it worked,
but then it didn't work,

26:54.446 --> 26:55.488
and I...
NANCY: Slower,

26:55.530 --> 26:56.906
with more specific words.

26:59.200 --> 27:03.580
Odette Lamar's ghost has been...

27:03.622 --> 27:05.540
time-sharing in my body
right now.

27:05.582 --> 27:06.958
Huh?
What?!

27:07.000 --> 27:08.835
(sighs)

27:08.877 --> 27:11.004
When I died and you brought me
back to life with the shroud,

27:11.046 --> 27:12.047
I didn't come back alone.

27:12.088 --> 27:14.132
You're possessed?
Well,

27:14.174 --> 27:15.759
this feels different.

27:15.800 --> 27:17.427
With Tiffany, I was almost dead
within 24 hours.

27:17.469 --> 27:19.679
Odette has been with me
for weeks. I've tried

27:19.721 --> 27:21.973
a bunch of different exorcisms,
and nothing has worked.

27:22.015 --> 27:24.434
Wait. Wait. Wait. You did
an exorcism without me?

27:24.476 --> 27:26.311
NANCY:
So that's not you
on the video.

27:26.353 --> 27:27.729
Not really. It's Odette.

27:27.771 --> 27:29.147
And I have no
memory of it.

27:29.189 --> 27:31.775
It's like
when Odette takes over,

27:31.816 --> 27:33.777
the switch goes off,
and I'm unconscious.

27:33.818 --> 27:36.529
Did you tell your mom?
Did you talk to her about it?

27:36.571 --> 27:38.948
What did she say?
No, I haven't
told anyone until now.

27:38.990 --> 27:40.867
And before you yell
at me, I know.

27:40.909 --> 27:42.535
Okay? Just save me
the lecture.

27:42.577 --> 27:45.830
George, we need to get
Odette out of your body.

27:45.872 --> 27:47.791
We have to. A possession
could kill you.

27:47.832 --> 27:49.209
Uh, maybe
the possession rules

27:49.250 --> 27:51.002
are different
with an older ghost.

27:51.044 --> 27:53.588
Maybe they don't, you know,
kill you as fast. I don't know.

27:53.630 --> 27:55.215
All right, well,
we have the time

27:55.256 --> 27:57.676
to figure out the problem
with my... passenger.

27:57.717 --> 27:59.969
Right now, we need
to focus on finding Jennifer.

28:00.011 --> 28:02.138
And in order to do that...
We have to talk to Odette.

28:02.180 --> 28:04.099
Yeah.

28:04.140 --> 28:06.643
(clears throat)

28:06.685 --> 28:08.853
(loudly):
Odette, can you hear us?

28:08.895 --> 28:10.980
No.
Okay.

28:11.898 --> 28:15.735
How... do you
make her come out?

28:15.777 --> 28:18.655
(scoffs)
If I knew, I wouldn't be
the most likely suspect

28:18.697 --> 28:21.199
in Jennifer's disappearance,
now, would I?

28:21.241 --> 28:23.451
I'm so hungry.
Oh, my God.

28:23.493 --> 28:26.538
Uh, George, um,
call me back when you get this.

28:26.579 --> 28:30.417
I'm just, um...
I'm just ch-checking in.

28:32.127 --> 28:35.088
Okay. Uh, love you.
Okay. Bye.

28:35.130 --> 28:38.133
Mm. You called
her again?

28:38.174 --> 28:41.594
Smells like girl trouble to me.

28:41.636 --> 28:44.180
We can help.
Tell us everything.

28:44.222 --> 28:46.641
Um...

28:46.683 --> 28:47.892
Okay, okay.

28:47.934 --> 28:51.104
Um, there was
a-a freak accident,

28:51.146 --> 28:54.274
and my girlfriend
almost died.

28:54.315 --> 28:56.443
But she's fine now.

28:56.484 --> 28:58.570
We're all fine.
You know, it's fine.

28:59.904 --> 29:01.865
But...

29:01.906 --> 29:03.992
it was scary.

29:04.909 --> 29:06.703
And I'm worried.

29:06.745 --> 29:09.330
Well, if I survived
a freak accident,

29:09.372 --> 29:11.291
I wouldn't want
anyone hovering.

29:11.332 --> 29:12.917
You know, I'd want
to move on,

29:12.959 --> 29:14.294
and I'd want the people
I love to move on, too.

29:14.335 --> 29:15.462
ISABEL:
I don't know.

29:15.503 --> 29:16.755
I think I'd want
people to keep

29:16.796 --> 29:18.173
checking in on me,
even if I wasn't ready

29:18.214 --> 29:19.591
to talk
about it yet.

29:19.632 --> 29:21.426
It's nice to know
people care.

29:21.468 --> 29:23.720
So, should I send
a follow-up text or-or not?

29:27.182 --> 29:29.267
(man speaking French on TV)

29:31.269 --> 29:34.105
I can't. I am so full.

29:34.147 --> 29:36.232
Well, then
we've tried everything.

29:36.274 --> 29:39.360
I mean, pastries,
portraits of Odette,

29:39.402 --> 29:42.322
pictures of her vineyard,
18th-century novels.

29:42.363 --> 29:45.074
I mean, I've read
Candide,

29:45.116 --> 29:47.827
and I still have no idea
what this book is about.

29:48.953 --> 29:50.997
What are we gonna do, George?

29:51.039 --> 29:52.665
We-we... we have
to talk to her.

29:52.707 --> 29:55.168
We-we have to find Jennifer.

29:55.210 --> 30:00.340
(groans)
Yeah, I... I hate
to say this, but...

30:00.381 --> 30:03.092
maybe it's time
we go to the cops.

30:03.134 --> 30:06.596
What? Y-You can't be serious.

30:06.638 --> 30:08.932
The-the only lead
that we have is a video

30:08.973 --> 30:10.600
of the missing person
and you.

30:10.642 --> 30:12.352
Well...
Detective Tamura
will arrest you

30:12.393 --> 30:13.978
before you can say
"nice jawline."

30:14.020 --> 30:15.396
(door opens)
NANCY:
I found it!

30:15.438 --> 30:17.607
It was under the
passenger seat in my car.

30:17.649 --> 30:19.526
(inhales, exhales)

30:19.567 --> 30:21.778
Odette, when you were
the Aglaeca, you burned most

30:21.820 --> 30:24.072
of the letters you wrote
to your beloved Englishwoman

30:24.113 --> 30:26.366
because they had the power to
destroy the monster you became.

30:26.407 --> 30:29.536
But now, you're a human spirit,
which means

30:29.577 --> 30:31.704
I am betting
that you would

30:31.746 --> 30:34.582
not like me
to destroy the last connection

30:34.624 --> 30:37.585
you had to the love
of your life.

30:57.647 --> 30:59.732
Hello, Odette.

30:59.774 --> 31:02.026
What happened last night?

31:02.068 --> 31:04.696
What did you do
with the girl at the hotel?

31:04.737 --> 31:07.448
(with French accent):
I was taking in the night air.

31:07.490 --> 31:09.993
I followed the sound
of her screams.

31:10.034 --> 31:11.911
She's with the hounds now.

31:11.953 --> 31:14.831
She won't be coming back.
With the hounds?

31:14.873 --> 31:16.624
BESS:
That's not just George
doing...

31:16.666 --> 31:18.751
(panting):
a French accent, is it?

31:18.793 --> 31:21.212
No, Bess, that's Odette.

31:24.591 --> 31:26.301
(normal accent):
Oh, my God, it-it worked?

31:26.342 --> 31:28.428
What'd she say?

31:28.469 --> 31:31.890
Well...
Um, that she's
with the hounds now.

31:31.931 --> 31:33.600
Like the hounds of hell?

31:33.641 --> 31:36.436
Okay, George,
don't panic, okay?

31:36.477 --> 31:39.647
But, um,
I'm 99.9% sure

31:39.689 --> 31:42.692
that you killed Jennifer.

31:50.867 --> 31:52.911
I mean, I really don't know
why I'm so surprised.

31:52.952 --> 31:55.413
When she was the Aglaeca,
she killed a bunch of people.

31:55.455 --> 31:58.708
Bess, Bess,
calm down, okay?

31:58.750 --> 32:01.210
George, you said sometimes
Odette can watch you

32:01.252 --> 32:03.212
when you look
in the mirror.

32:03.254 --> 32:05.214
And can you watch her
when she's in control?

32:05.256 --> 32:07.759
No, I-I'm telling you,
I don't remember anything.

32:07.800 --> 32:09.677
I-I mean...

32:09.719 --> 32:12.388
well, is she just gonna stay
in your body forever?

32:12.430 --> 32:14.474
I mean, what does
she even want?

32:14.515 --> 32:16.476
What, to murder us all?

32:16.517 --> 32:19.187
And-and why was she at the hotel
in the first place?

32:19.228 --> 32:21.773
Odette's been stuck
in George's body for weeks.

32:21.814 --> 32:23.942
I mean, maybe she
got full control

32:23.983 --> 32:26.194
and wanted to
go for a walk.

32:26.235 --> 32:28.404
Give me your phone.

32:29.530 --> 32:31.616
We can track
Odette's whereabouts--

32:31.658 --> 32:34.702
where she went,
where she took Jennifer.

32:34.744 --> 32:36.871
Let's see
what her Maps app says.

32:37.830 --> 32:39.332
(sighs)

32:40.625 --> 32:44.087
Odette did take Jennifer
to the hounds.

32:44.128 --> 32:46.089
(sighs)

32:54.222 --> 32:56.307
(indistinct announcement
over P.A.)

33:09.237 --> 33:12.323
Your teammates asked
me to find you.

33:14.784 --> 33:16.786
I'm Nancy.

33:21.541 --> 33:24.043
Did you know there's
a hidden compartment

33:24.085 --> 33:26.421
in the windowsill in room 413?

33:26.462 --> 33:29.298
The hotel staff fills
it with chicken blood.

33:30.341 --> 33:32.218
So gross.

33:32.260 --> 33:34.846
I think what happened was,
whoever filled the compartment

33:34.887 --> 33:37.098
didn't close the hidden door
all the way.

33:37.140 --> 33:39.350
So when you were in
there alone by yourself

33:39.392 --> 33:41.728
in the dark, scared,

33:41.769 --> 33:44.105
you saw a sliver of light,

33:44.147 --> 33:45.648
and you ran.

33:50.820 --> 33:53.156
(scoffs softly)

33:53.197 --> 33:56.200
Crashed is more like it.

33:58.786 --> 34:02.206
Right into the basement.

34:02.248 --> 34:06.252
And then this weird,
angry French girl found me,

34:06.294 --> 34:09.088
and she didn't seem to know
what a cell phone was,

34:09.130 --> 34:12.759
but she had one on her
and she let me use it.

34:12.800 --> 34:16.721
You made sure that the servants'
door was shut behind you.

34:18.514 --> 34:20.725
So your teammates
couldn't follow.

34:20.767 --> 34:22.769
That was pretty extreme.

34:22.810 --> 34:25.271
I was wondering why.

34:27.231 --> 34:29.317
I wanted to vanish.

34:32.779 --> 34:35.615
College isn't
what I thought it would be.

34:35.656 --> 34:39.160
I'm not who I thought
I would be.

34:39.202 --> 34:41.120
I can relate.

34:42.872 --> 34:47.376
My whole life, all I cared about
was getting into a good college.

34:47.418 --> 34:50.213
And when I did,
I realized my whole identity

34:50.254 --> 34:52.673
was built around that.

34:52.715 --> 34:54.258
I didn't know

34:54.300 --> 34:56.385
who I was supposed to be now.

34:56.427 --> 34:57.845
That secret door,

34:57.887 --> 35:00.264
that was my ticket home.

35:00.306 --> 35:02.767
A way to just...
(takes deep breath)

35:02.809 --> 35:04.435
disappear.

35:04.477 --> 35:06.729
Without being...

35:06.771 --> 35:08.940
that girl that
dropped out of college.

35:08.981 --> 35:10.983
Then why haven't you left?

35:11.025 --> 35:13.945
I checked the schedule--
there have been three buses

35:13.986 --> 35:15.988
that could have taken you home
by now.

35:16.030 --> 35:18.366
Never mind.

35:18.407 --> 35:20.493
You don't understand.

35:20.535 --> 35:21.828
I do understand.

35:21.869 --> 35:24.539
(takes deep breath)

35:24.580 --> 35:27.708
You don't want to be
the "college dropout."

35:27.750 --> 35:29.335
Well...

35:29.377 --> 35:33.297
you are talking to the
"high school burnout."

35:33.339 --> 35:35.466
Big dreams of going
to a fancy school

35:35.508 --> 35:37.885
totally abandoned,
because...

35:37.927 --> 35:39.846
my...

35:39.887 --> 35:42.807
my mom got sick...

35:42.849 --> 35:44.934
and she died.

35:46.144 --> 35:48.104
And so I stopped trying.

35:48.146 --> 35:50.731
And then I found
out some pretty...

35:50.773 --> 35:53.359
some pretty messed-up stuff
about my family.

35:53.401 --> 35:55.236
And my...
my boyfriend

35:55.278 --> 35:56.946
was murdered.

35:56.988 --> 35:58.739
And then I
realized that

35:58.781 --> 36:02.118
I am not who I should be.

36:04.245 --> 36:07.874
No college wants
this version of me.

36:11.210 --> 36:14.964
You went through all of that?

36:17.008 --> 36:19.594
You solved a freaking mystery

36:19.635 --> 36:22.180
after all of that?

36:23.639 --> 36:28.352
Here I am, struggling
with a minor existential crisis.

36:29.270 --> 36:32.607
Why did you let me talk
for so long?

36:35.401 --> 36:38.362
I think there's a reason
you didn't go on that bus.

36:40.364 --> 36:42.325
I think there's a reason

36:42.366 --> 36:45.036
you keep thinking
about going to school.

36:47.038 --> 36:51.918
Maybe you're not who you thought
you should be, but...

36:51.959 --> 36:55.755
who you are now
is still pretty badass.

36:58.216 --> 37:00.426
(sniffles, exhales)

37:05.389 --> 37:07.767
You took a job with him?

37:07.808 --> 37:09.393
Just let me
explain.
No.

37:09.435 --> 37:11.145
No, no, no. No, no.
I think I got it.

37:11.187 --> 37:13.522
You ran back to Daddy
the first chance you got.

37:13.564 --> 37:14.982
Everett's using you.

37:15.024 --> 37:16.651
He wants the public to think
you've forgiven him

37:16.692 --> 37:18.527
for what he did to Lucy.
And my forgiveness

37:18.569 --> 37:21.864
is only useful for him
ahead of his murder trial.

37:21.906 --> 37:24.367
But that gives me
all the power, Nick.

37:24.408 --> 37:27.119
Look, when I was 11,
there was this bully named Max.

37:27.161 --> 37:29.288
Oh, my God.
I do not need some sob story

37:29.330 --> 37:31.040
about Max the bully.
Listen to me.

37:31.082 --> 37:32.833
I came home from
school one day.

37:32.875 --> 37:34.460
I was all scared
because Max said

37:34.502 --> 37:35.962
he was gonna beat me up.

37:36.003 --> 37:37.713
So Everett decides
that he's gonna teach me

37:37.755 --> 37:39.090
how to throw a punch, right?

37:39.131 --> 37:40.967
So he says, "You got
to let him in close.

37:41.008 --> 37:43.135
That's how you deal
the fatal blow."

37:43.177 --> 37:45.263
Then he punches me.

37:46.555 --> 37:49.100
He thought I was gonna block it,
but I didn't.

37:49.141 --> 37:51.978
So instead, I start crying.

37:52.019 --> 37:54.772
He tells me he's disgusted
with me, I'm useless.

37:54.814 --> 37:56.774
So I go to school
the next day

37:56.816 --> 37:58.901
just expecting to
get my ass kicked,

37:58.943 --> 38:00.528
only Max wasn't even there.

38:00.569 --> 38:02.321
'Cause Everett paid his family

38:02.363 --> 38:04.657
to have him transferred
to another school.

38:06.200 --> 38:08.119
Hell of a dad.

38:09.078 --> 38:10.454
Yeah.

38:10.496 --> 38:13.207
Hell of a dad.

38:13.249 --> 38:16.460
Nick, that's
why I took this job.

38:16.502 --> 38:20.131
'Cause I got to get close to him
so I can deal a fatal blow.

38:20.172 --> 38:22.174
But if he finds out it's me,

38:22.216 --> 38:25.303
then Nancy's life is
in serious danger.

38:25.344 --> 38:27.930
So the only way
I'm gonna pull this off

38:27.972 --> 38:30.057
is if you help me.

38:31.183 --> 38:33.561
And then your life's
in serious danger.

38:34.562 --> 38:36.605
I'm all in.

38:36.647 --> 38:40.109
I made a promise to Tiffany,
and I intend to keep it.

38:42.278 --> 38:43.988
EVIE:
And even though
you didn't complete

38:44.030 --> 38:46.699
the initiation, we're still glad
to have you on the team.

38:46.741 --> 38:48.367
You're officially

38:48.409 --> 38:50.494
a Polar Bear.
(laughs)

38:50.536 --> 38:51.787
(laughs)

38:53.539 --> 38:58.085
I've had a lot of time
to think, and...

38:58.127 --> 39:01.130
this isn't for me.

39:01.172 --> 39:05.051
Playing volleyball was something
that I thought I had to do,

39:05.092 --> 39:07.011
but...

39:07.053 --> 39:09.221
I don't feel that way anymore.

39:10.181 --> 39:12.058
EVIE:
Well, that's okay, too.

39:12.099 --> 39:14.226
Come here.

39:14.268 --> 39:16.604
(laughing)

39:16.645 --> 39:17.688
Let's go.

39:17.730 --> 39:19.357
Let's go.
Bye, Nancy.

39:19.398 --> 39:20.733
Bye.

39:20.775 --> 39:22.401
(door opens)

39:22.443 --> 39:24.028
(door closes)

39:24.070 --> 39:25.446
(sighs)

39:32.036 --> 39:34.455
(taps key)

39:44.757 --> 39:46.258
(sighs heavily)

39:48.719 --> 39:50.429
I don't think it
should be a secret.

39:50.471 --> 39:51.847
I think you
should tell him.

39:51.889 --> 39:53.682
I'm asking you to wait,
Bess, okay?

39:53.724 --> 39:55.559
Nick deserves
to know.

39:55.601 --> 39:57.269
You want to know why Nick
is so tired?

39:57.311 --> 39:59.730
He wakes up every night
screaming, okay?

39:59.772 --> 40:01.774
He has nightmares
about me dying in his arms.

40:01.816 --> 40:04.235
So I would really like to
hold off on adding anything else

40:04.276 --> 40:05.861
to his plate right now,
if that's okay

40:05.903 --> 40:07.405
with you.
Okay. I'm sorry.

40:07.446 --> 40:09.365
(sighs)
I'm sorry. We'll wait.

40:09.407 --> 40:12.243
Uh, we can do some more research
in the meantime and...

40:12.284 --> 40:14.245
figure out a way
of getting rid of Odette.

40:14.286 --> 40:17.331
♪ ♪

40:18.833 --> 40:21.377
(breath trembles)
Odette.

40:21.419 --> 40:24.213
(with French accent):
The only way to get rid of me

40:24.255 --> 40:26.507
is to kill your friend.

40:26.549 --> 40:28.843
Is that actually true?

40:28.884 --> 40:31.720
Or are you just saying that
'cause you don't want to leave?

40:40.604 --> 40:41.730
Hey.

40:41.772 --> 40:44.066
Just wanted to
swing by and see

40:44.108 --> 40:46.902
how my patient was doing.
Running like a dream.

40:47.862 --> 40:49.780
Did Nancy get what she needed?

40:53.451 --> 40:54.910
It's fine.

40:54.952 --> 40:56.412
Just...

40:56.454 --> 40:58.664
next time,
you don't have to trick me.

40:58.706 --> 41:00.583
With the flirting and charm,
you know?

41:00.624 --> 41:02.751
You could just tell me
what the plan is.

41:02.793 --> 41:04.962
I've heard I'm extremely chill.

41:05.004 --> 41:08.048
The flirting wasn't a ruse.

41:08.090 --> 41:09.758
MAN:
Excuse me.

41:09.800 --> 41:11.802
(quietly):
Don't go anywhere.

41:11.844 --> 41:13.512
Hi. Checking in?

41:13.554 --> 41:14.930
MAN:
Yeah.

41:14.972 --> 41:16.891
What brings you
to Horseshoe Bay, sir?

41:16.932 --> 41:18.559
I'm here to find my wife.

41:18.601 --> 41:20.978
I don't suppose
you know her, do you?
