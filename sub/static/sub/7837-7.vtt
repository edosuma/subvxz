That last one

Marge, TV and nightmares
have joined forces
to teach me a lesson.

11:37.447 --> 11:41.075
From now on,
l will stop being selfish
and start being good.

11:41.159 --> 11:44.495
ln fact, l'll be
the nicest man in town.

11:44.829 --> 11:46.663

this last pork chop?

12:38.133 --> 12:40.843

13:26.598 --> 13:28.640
l'm not looking
for glory or wealth.

13:28.725 --> 13:31.810
