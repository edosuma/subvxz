WEBVTT

00:16.920 --> 00:19.800
Man, you're gorgeous.

00:19.880 --> 00:21.960
You never cry.
You like it here, huh?

00:22.040 --> 00:25.440
You know you could've been
on the other side of the globe right now?

00:25.520 --> 00:28.040
Like in China,
America, or India...

00:28.120 --> 00:30.080
where now it's day
instead of night?

00:31.000 --> 00:34.520
Where the language is weird,
and the food even weird.

00:34.960 --> 00:39.680
It was a close call.
Instead, we're here in the Eternal City.

00:40.200 --> 00:43.040
A bit on the outskirts, but still
in the world's most gorgeous city.

00:43.120 --> 00:44.440
You have your dad
to thank for it.

00:46.240 --> 00:50.480
Mom helped a bit, I guess.
Without her...

00:53.560 --> 00:55.200
...you wouldn't be here.

00:55.920 --> 00:58.280
And I may have done
something reckless.

01:01.680 --> 01:04.640
-Number 1, Wojciech...
-Szczęsny!

01:05.600 --> 01:09.120
-Number 2, Antonio...
-Rüdiger!

01:09.720 --> 01:12.800
-Number 20, Federico...
-Fazio!

01:12.880 --> 01:16.800
-Number 44, Kostas...
-Manōlas!

01:17.520 --> 01:20.440
-Number 33, Emerson...
-Palmieri!

01:20.520 --> 01:24.160
-Number 16, Daniele...
-De Rossi!

01:24.640 --> 01:28.280
-Number 6, Kevin...
-Strootman!

01:28.360 --> 01:31.800
-Number 11, Mohamed...
-Salah!

01:31.880 --> 01:35.600
-Number 92, Stephan...
-El Shaarawy!

01:35.680 --> 01:39.840
-Number 4, Radja...
-Nainggolan!

01:39.920 --> 01:43.600
-Number 9, Edin...
-Džeko!

01:44.960 --> 01:45.960
On the sidelines...

01:47.040 --> 01:50.720
He was born a soccer player,
grew up a myth

01:50.800 --> 01:52.920
and then, a legend.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.920
Thank you, Captain.
Number 10, Francesco...

01:57.000 --> 01:58.160
TOTTI: ONE CAPTAIN

01:58.240 --> 01:59.960
Totti!

02:03.440 --> 02:06.280
To Romans and Roma fans,
Totti means soccer.

02:06.360 --> 02:07.240
He's an icon.

02:09.560 --> 02:14.440
The kings of Rome
won wars and turned the city

02:14.520 --> 02:17.640
into one of history's
greatest empires.

02:17.720 --> 02:20.400
Totti turned the Roma team...

02:20.480 --> 02:22.520
into Italy's greatest soccer empire.

02:23.080 --> 02:25.960
We'll never forget he won us
a Championship all by himself.

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
Totti's name was yelled the loudest.
It shook the stadium.

02:35.080 --> 02:39.600
Tomorrow we'll wake up,
open the sports papers, and read

02:39.680 --> 02:41.320
that Totti got renewed
for four more years.

02:41.400 --> 02:42.680
Take my word for it.

02:52.440 --> 02:53.720
-Hi, Captain.
-Hey.

02:53.800 --> 02:55.760
You made me cry
with those two goals.

02:55.840 --> 02:57.280
-Nice, huh?
-A dream come true.

02:57.720 --> 02:59.680
-What's all this?
-You know how Americans are.

02:59.760 --> 03:01.360
They want a job well done.

03:02.520 --> 03:03.920
-Francesco.
-Good morning.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.720
Hey, how are the others?

03:08.360 --> 03:09.840
So, Francesco...

03:10.240 --> 03:12.120
We were half expecting
to see you in a tie.

03:12.400 --> 03:14.440
-Instead...
-Like an executive...

03:14.520 --> 03:15.960
But you'll keep
your soccer shoes instead.

03:16.600 --> 03:18.520
In three matches
you changed everyone's mind.

03:18.600 --> 03:21.160
-Everyone?
-Everyone, Francesco. Everyone.

03:21.480 --> 03:24.960
That's why we have decided
to put controversies aside,

03:25.040 --> 03:27.400
let bygones be bygones
and look ahead.

03:27.880 --> 03:30.480
-You deserved the renewal.
-I agree.

03:30.560 --> 03:31.680
For another year.

03:32.560 --> 03:33.640
The last one.

03:38.840 --> 03:40.880
We'll make the announcement
at the end of the Championship.

03:41.360 --> 03:44.600
We'll give the end of your career
the tribute it deserves

03:44.680 --> 03:47.000
avoiding a repeat of the last year's
tiresome uncertainties

03:47.080 --> 03:49.560
then we'll begin a new chapter
and you'll step over to our side

03:49.840 --> 03:52.120
bringing some youth
to the executive branch.

03:55.440 --> 03:56.560
One year...

03:57.240 --> 03:58.480
The last one.

03:59.720 --> 04:00.760
The last one.

04:05.080 --> 04:06.240
You're almost 40.

04:11.680 --> 04:15.040
We'll give the end of your career
the tribute it deserves.

04:15.120 --> 04:16.680
A glorious career.

04:17.160 --> 04:20.840
-One year.
-The last one.

04:22.840 --> 04:23.800
Aren't you happy?

04:24.240 --> 04:27.520
It's still the same story, though.
I'm the one quitting, right?

04:28.080 --> 04:29.920
Shouldn't I decide when?

04:30.000 --> 04:32.600
-Sure.
-Why should someone else decide?

04:32.960 --> 04:34.800
These guys come in and say,
"One last year."

04:34.880 --> 04:35.760
What does that mean?

04:36.720 --> 04:37.760
Don't sign, then.

04:40.040 --> 04:41.400
What do you mean?

04:41.480 --> 04:45.400
If a year isn't enough, go somewhere else
and take a longer contract.

04:45.480 --> 04:46.560
Are you kidding me?

04:46.640 --> 04:51.760
You could play in Japan,
China, America, even Dubai.

04:51.840 --> 04:53.560
They'd treat you like a star.

04:53.640 --> 04:57.760
You wouldn't have to fight
to play five minutes, as you would here.

04:57.840 --> 05:01.680
You would have fun, and that's it.
I'd think about it.

05:09.160 --> 05:10.360
Francesco, what is it?

05:39.720 --> 05:41.160
Moving on to Roma

05:41.240 --> 05:45.560
Higuain propels it near the top,
scoring two decisive goals.

05:45.640 --> 05:46.960
Roma isn't giving up

05:47.040 --> 05:50.040
as a splendid Totti
makes Spalletti cheer again in Genoa.

05:50.120 --> 05:51.040
ROMA BELONGS TO TOTTI

05:51.120 --> 05:53.240
His renewal now appears
a mere formality.

05:53.320 --> 05:54.840
We're waiting for Francesco.

05:55.560 --> 05:58.560
His renewal is well deserved,
but I'd like to stress.

05:58.640 --> 06:01.680
how much credit,
on behalf of the whole club

06:01.760 --> 06:05.920
goes to our coach, because Spalletti
was a great motivator for him.

06:06.280 --> 06:09.080
Baldy gets the credit?
These guys are mental.

06:09.160 --> 06:11.000
Totti's role
in Roma's next season

06:11.080 --> 06:13.360
is now taken for granted.

06:13.440 --> 06:16.320
We asked Spalletti
about his draft intentions.

06:16.400 --> 06:17.400
Here's what he told us.

06:18.040 --> 06:22.080
I'm happy if Francesco is happy,
and more than that, the club knows...

06:22.160 --> 06:23.400
He talks
as if he's the player.

06:23.480 --> 06:27.440
If Francesco wants a contract,
I'm on his side and eager to help.

06:27.520 --> 06:29.280
So is Totti still useful?

06:30.280 --> 06:33.800
You see,
Totti is like a diamond.

06:33.880 --> 06:38.200
You can't wear it all the time.
You save him for special occasions.

06:38.880 --> 06:42.440
"Special occasions"?
I'll show him a special occasion.

06:42.520 --> 06:45.560
I feel like saying you're right
and telling everyone to fuck off.

06:45.640 --> 06:48.440
-So you're thinking about it?
-Would I be here if I wasn't?

06:48.520 --> 06:49.800
I always am.

06:52.360 --> 06:53.760
Not about not signing.

06:54.800 --> 06:56.160
How could I?
That's impossible.

06:56.960 --> 06:59.640
After a life spent here,
just 'cause of these guys...

06:59.720 --> 07:02.560
It's precisely because you spent
a life here, Francesco.

07:02.880 --> 07:06.120
In a four-point pen between
Vetulonia, Axa, EUR and Trigoria.

07:06.200 --> 07:08.120
-What's this, now?
-It's the truth.

07:08.680 --> 07:10.440
The truth about what?
What are you saying?

07:11.880 --> 07:13.440
What are you talking about?
You're crazy.

07:13.720 --> 07:16.440
Why am I crazy?
I'll take a sabbatical.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.920
I'll take a break from work
and follow you abroad with the kids.

07:22.400 --> 07:25.080
I can't believe this.
Let's hear it again.

07:25.600 --> 07:31.520
I'll take a sabbatical,
a break from work.

07:31.600 --> 07:33.280
No way.
She really said it.

07:34.720 --> 07:37.640
To understand the reason
for my baffled look

07:38.120 --> 07:41.640
we must go back about 15 years,
to this other look.

07:55.520 --> 07:56.520
25 years old.

07:58.640 --> 08:01.240
Captain of the Roma team,
fresh off the Championship.

08:03.520 --> 08:07.200
A hell of a player,
on and off the field.

08:11.800 --> 08:14.600
Look how many.
Where did they put them?

08:15.560 --> 08:17.440
Hear this one, listen.

08:17.520 --> 08:19.640
"Hi, I'm Anna.
I want to be your penalty kick mark."

08:19.720 --> 08:21.320
Who says something like this
to a soccer player?

08:21.400 --> 08:23.800
-Anna... You remember her?
-No, it can't be.

08:23.880 --> 08:26.280
-Are you kidding? It's her handwriting.
-You've got it wrong.

08:26.360 --> 08:31.240
"Hi, I'm Marina. With me,
you'll never raise the offside flag."

08:31.320 --> 08:33.600
-Wow!
-What does that mean?

08:33.680 --> 08:37.840
With Ilary, it was love
at first sight... on TV.

08:44.160 --> 08:46.400
Don't look at quiz shows.
You don't understand them.

08:46.560 --> 08:47.880
I'm going to marry her.

08:50.360 --> 08:51.560
INTERVIEW

08:51.840 --> 08:53.800
I lived in Milan,
I had my own TV show.

08:53.880 --> 08:54.800
I had a boyfriend.

08:54.880 --> 08:56.720
-One day Silvia called me.
-Her sister.

08:56.800 --> 09:00.320
"There's this guy in Rome
who likes you a lot."

09:00.400 --> 09:02.160
-"Francesco Totti."
-"Who's that?"

09:02.240 --> 09:03.480
-She's a Lazio fan.
-Get out.

09:03.560 --> 09:06.760
-A little. Almost a lot.
-This guy was a bit weird.

09:06.840 --> 09:08.480
You can't just stare at her.

09:08.560 --> 09:11.880
She lives in Milan, has a boyfriend,
and doesn't care about soccer.

09:11.960 --> 09:13.080
You've got to woo her.

09:13.160 --> 09:16.120
Do something, Fra'.
Show her there's life on Earth.

09:16.200 --> 09:18.680
I'm no longer used to it.
Girls put the moves on  me  now.

09:18.760 --> 09:21.840
I'm out of practice.
Plus she has a strange effect on me.

09:21.920 --> 09:24.000
When I was with her,
my legs wobbled.

09:24.360 --> 09:26.920
I was...
a total dunce.

09:31.360 --> 09:33.680
-Nice to meet you, I'm Francesco.
-Hi, Francesco.

09:35.240 --> 09:36.240
Hi, Francesco.

09:37.400 --> 09:38.360
Yeah, I got that.

09:42.160 --> 09:43.280
Francesco is a nice name.

09:45.080 --> 09:47.720
-What did you say your name was?
-It's Ilary still.

09:48.360 --> 09:49.840
"Still" is your family name?

09:49.920 --> 09:51.760
My brain goes blank
when I think of her.

09:52.960 --> 09:55.160
-Don't look at her.
-You're such a moron.

09:55.240 --> 09:57.080
His best material
came from texting.

09:57.160 --> 09:58.040
"Hi, how are you?"

09:58.120 --> 10:00.160
"Hi, what are you doing?"
"Hi, what's shaking?"

10:00.640 --> 10:02.560
-Sent.
-What did you write?

10:03.960 --> 10:04.800
"Hi...

10:06.040 --> 10:07.080
How are you?"

10:11.040 --> 10:12.880
-And then?
-That's it.

10:12.960 --> 10:15.320
-That's it?
-I don't want to put pressure on her.

10:17.720 --> 10:19.920
-No pressure, huh?
-We don't know each other yet.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
She came to Rome
on the weekends.

10:22.400 --> 10:24.080
For a soccer player,
weekends are hard.

10:24.160 --> 10:25.680
So I went all-in.

10:25.760 --> 10:26.840
"Wanna come
to the stadium?"

10:26.920 --> 10:30.240
It has to be something... understand?
Something she's never seen before.

10:30.320 --> 10:31.560
Like what?
What do you want to do?

10:31.640 --> 10:34.960
Something with punch,
to sweep her off her feet.

10:35.040 --> 10:38.120
Gotcha. Something she's
never seen before.

10:38.200 --> 10:41.000
Not the usual trashy t-shirt, got it?
Something...

10:41.080 --> 10:43.200
-Yes, something unique.
-Yeah, that's it.

10:43.280 --> 10:45.840
-Something unique, got it.
-As unique as she is. All right?

10:45.920 --> 10:47.440
-Leave it to me.
-Something like...

10:47.800 --> 10:50.480
She's not like any other.
When I raise it she has to...

10:51.840 --> 10:52.720
Wait...

10:55.520 --> 10:57.360
-It's the city derby.
-Yeah, I know.

10:58.640 --> 11:00.840
-It's the derby.
-Yeah, the derby! I know!

11:02.400 --> 11:04.440
"March 10th", she said.

11:05.640 --> 11:07.800
-She's coming to the derby.
-Yeah. And?

11:08.080 --> 11:11.120
-What if we lose?
-You'll clobber them! No way!

11:11.200 --> 11:13.760
-The derby's not your usual game.
-Fine, but...

11:13.840 --> 11:15.320
What if I don't score?

11:16.640 --> 11:20.360
She's coming all the way from Milan.
Let's write "I'm sorry".

11:37.760 --> 11:40.040
Roma had not
won a derby

11:40.120 --> 11:43.480
with a 4-goal advantage
since 1934.

11:43.560 --> 11:46.840
I knew she was there
so I felt nervous.

11:46.920 --> 11:48.200
Victory like that

11:48.320 --> 11:50.240
wasn't even in
my wildest dreams.

11:50.320 --> 11:52.840
Instead,
it was a dream come true.

12:16.520 --> 12:19.000
It was utter chaos.

12:19.080 --> 12:21.840
The stadium
was full of people yelling.

12:21.920 --> 12:23.880
They looked like
they were mad.

12:23.960 --> 12:26.000
Then at a certain point,
Giancarlo and Angelo

12:26.080 --> 12:29.120
made me stand up,
and I saw.

12:31.880 --> 12:33.760
YOU'RE THE ONE

12:33.840 --> 12:36.120
It was all just
for that moment.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.400
I asked her out,
and she said yes.

12:39.480 --> 12:42.920
And we went to...
I took her to a place.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.600
You can imagine
how nervous I was.

12:44.640 --> 12:46.360
Because it's not as if
I can go anywhere.

12:49.920 --> 12:52.480
"The Mushroom."
So-called because...

12:53.720 --> 12:55.680
Well, it's self-explanatory.

12:57.640 --> 12:58.760
Do you like it here?

12:58.840 --> 13:00.480
-Yes, it's lovely.
-Nice, huh?

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
-Ever been here before?
-No, never.

13:04.880 --> 13:07.960
Me neither.
I mean, only a few times.

13:08.160 --> 13:10.160
On special occasions.

13:12.240 --> 13:15.120
It's beautiful by day.
You can see all of Rome.

13:16.240 --> 13:17.240
What's so funny?

13:22.320 --> 13:23.320
May I ask you a question?

13:25.040 --> 13:26.240
Do you still have a boyfriend?

13:27.720 --> 13:28.640
Why do you ask?

13:28.840 --> 13:31.440
Since I saw you on TV,
all I do is think about you.

13:35.280 --> 13:37.760
-Listen, I've heard.
-Heard what?

13:37.840 --> 13:39.120
That you're a womanizer.

13:39.960 --> 13:45.040
Me, a womanizer? No.
In the past. It's impossible now, I swear.

13:45.360 --> 13:46.680
No, it's really impossible.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.400
Look, I'm not playing around.

13:51.160 --> 13:54.560
You're not a trophy to me.
You're not like the others.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
You're special.
I saw that right away.

13:58.920 --> 14:01.560
Forget what they say about soccer players
and everything else.

14:02.440 --> 14:05.880
I took the Ferrari
'cause my mother got the small car

14:05.960 --> 14:07.560
and I couldn't find the keys
to the sedan.

14:08.360 --> 14:11.640
I'm just a 26-year-old guy
who has fallen in love with you.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.920
Francesco, I knew straight away
that you were special.

14:21.160 --> 14:22.440
That you have a good heart.

14:23.760 --> 14:24.720
It's something.

14:26.000 --> 14:30.600
I like the way you look at me,
you make me feel desired.

14:31.720 --> 14:32.680
But...

14:34.840 --> 14:35.720
But?

14:35.800 --> 14:38.800
But I can't forget
who I am and who you are.

14:39.560 --> 14:41.120
The showgirl
and the soccer player.

14:41.200 --> 14:44.000
Nothing's more taken for granted
in Italy, it's banal.

14:44.080 --> 14:46.920
Forget about the showgirl
and the soccer player.

14:49.720 --> 14:51.320
I'm not good at talking.

14:52.120 --> 14:55.640
I'm saying that we are
Ilary and Francesco.

14:56.720 --> 15:00.800
That's what we are. And it's up to us
to make our story special.

15:04.800 --> 15:05.960
I promise.

15:06.040 --> 15:08.320
And we kept that promise.

15:09.120 --> 15:11.120
It felt natural to keep dating.

15:11.720 --> 15:12.680
Well?

15:13.400 --> 15:15.400
-"Well" what?
-What?

15:15.480 --> 15:19.320
The beach, the castle, the sea.
You got something to tell me?

15:22.360 --> 15:24.040
-Ila...
-Yes?

15:24.120 --> 15:25.520
Will you marry me?

15:31.880 --> 15:34.320
-You have to think about it this much?
-No...

15:34.400 --> 15:36.680
No, you won't marry me?

15:36.760 --> 15:38.600
No, I don't have
to think about it much.

15:39.560 --> 15:40.440
So?

15:41.680 --> 15:44.000
-So, yes.
-Yes?

15:45.040 --> 15:47.080
-You'll marry me?
-Yes.

15:47.600 --> 15:49.200
Can I kiss you? Huh?

15:50.360 --> 15:51.360
You said yes,
didn't you?

15:51.440 --> 15:53.080
-I said yes.
-Yes?

15:55.760 --> 15:56.800
Forever, right?

16:00.320 --> 16:02.280
-Say yes again.
-Yes!

16:03.520 --> 16:04.560
The ring?

16:04.640 --> 16:06.000
-Huh?
-The ring.

16:07.000 --> 16:07.880
I'll give you mine.

16:08.560 --> 16:10.000
Get out!
You don't have a ring?

16:10.480 --> 16:12.120
Everything was closed today.

16:12.480 --> 16:16.240
-You decided today?
-I'll buy you a ring.

16:21.160 --> 16:22.400
I'm hearing music.

16:22.480 --> 16:23.360
You are?

16:24.840 --> 16:27.040
"I will be sincere with you,
I will stay..."

16:27.120 --> 16:29.040
-You hear it, too?
-I hear it, too.

16:29.120 --> 16:30.320
"... just as I am."

16:31.080 --> 16:32.440
-Where is it?
-It's Celentano!

16:32.520 --> 16:35.600
-They're selling tacos?
-"It's Celentano," I said. You dumbo.

16:37.200 --> 16:40.680
Celentano, the singer?
Can't argue, then.

16:40.760 --> 16:42.080
All right.

16:42.160 --> 16:43.360
Your shoes are untied.

16:43.920 --> 16:45.440
-I don't have shoestrings.
-I'll tie them.

16:47.680 --> 16:53.560
# Here in my arms
you will sleep serenely #

16:54.440 --> 16:58.800
# And that's the important thing,
you know #

16:58.880 --> 17:01.760
# If we really wanna be ourselves... #

17:05.880 --> 17:09.840
I had been perfect until then.
Nailed it all.

17:09.920 --> 17:13.040
From the "Mushroom" to the castle,
a triumphal march.

17:13.120 --> 17:14.720
Even Celentano in the background.

17:14.800 --> 17:18.760
But there's always something
waiting to strike at such times.

17:19.760 --> 17:20.960
Being a jackass.

17:21.320 --> 17:22.560
I was thinking...

17:24.000 --> 17:25.640
Now that we're getting married...

17:27.480 --> 17:28.840
You could quit your job.

17:30.800 --> 17:32.560
Excuse me?
I didn't catch that.

17:32.960 --> 17:36.400
Second jackass move:
thinking she really hadn't

17:36.960 --> 17:39.480
and digging my hole
even deeper.

17:39.920 --> 17:41.280
I mean...

17:41.360 --> 17:43.000
Now that you'll be my wife...

17:44.120 --> 17:46.440
With like, a family...

17:48.240 --> 17:49.600
We'll have children, right?

17:50.200 --> 17:54.640
You could quit TV
and take care of our children.

17:55.760 --> 17:58.360
Building a family together
would be nice, right?

17:58.960 --> 18:00.000
It's normal.

18:00.080 --> 18:04.480
This is what you, Francesco Totti,
in 2005, think about the role of women?

18:05.320 --> 18:07.440
-What? I don't understand.
-Let's go. It's late.

18:07.520 --> 18:11.880
-Are you angry? Hey, I was kidding.
-But I wasn't, Francesco.

18:12.440 --> 18:14.840
I want to make this clear
right from the start.

18:14.920 --> 18:18.240
-I will never put my work aside.
-Of course.

18:18.320 --> 18:21.200
Not even if you go play abroad
in the future.

18:21.280 --> 18:24.400
My life won't be just that
of a soccer player's wife, got it?

18:24.720 --> 18:29.080
Of course not.
You got it wrong. I said that, but...

18:30.160 --> 18:33.000
Now, can you see
why Ilary's words...

18:33.480 --> 18:39.000
I'll take a sabbatical,
a break from work.

18:39.480 --> 18:40.720
...were so incredible?

18:43.520 --> 18:45.280
All right, I can't accept that.

18:45.960 --> 18:48.360
-What do you mean?
-What do I mean?

18:48.440 --> 18:51.880
You're crazy.
At the height of your career?

18:52.520 --> 18:54.360
-No. It's absolute madness.
-It's not madness.

18:54.440 --> 18:56.280
You don't realize how crazy this is.

18:56.360 --> 18:58.800
Francesco, TV won't go anywhere.
It's nothing.

18:58.880 --> 19:01.280
That's not true.
Things don't always stay the same.

19:01.360 --> 19:03.800
Not my point.
You're what's most important now.

19:03.880 --> 19:05.640
You don't realize
what a sacrifice it would be.

19:06.080 --> 19:09.600
It's not like going
from San Giovanni to EUR.

19:09.680 --> 19:10.600
Yes, I know.

19:11.080 --> 19:13.720
We're talking across the planet.
You know what that means?

19:13.800 --> 19:14.760
-Sure.
-No, you don't.

19:14.840 --> 19:16.520
-You wouldn't be the first.
-Yes, I would.

19:16.600 --> 19:20.160
-Lots of soccer players do it.
-That isn't true. Name one.

19:20.240 --> 19:23.240
Come on, a lot of people.
I don't have names on me.

19:23.320 --> 19:25.400
-It's different.
-Why don't you call one of them?

19:25.480 --> 19:26.840
I'm not calling anyone.
Stop it.

19:26.920 --> 19:30.800
Why not? Call them,
it may help make up your mind.

19:30.880 --> 19:32.360
-I'm not calling anyone.
-Just try.

19:32.440 --> 19:34.040
-No!
-Lower your voice.

19:34.120 --> 19:36.680
I'm not calling anyone.
Enough of this.

19:40.480 --> 19:41.520
So you're renewing?

19:42.800 --> 19:44.960
Andre',
I'm thinking about it.

19:46.160 --> 19:47.760
Also because...

19:47.840 --> 19:51.240
I don't want
to have any regrets later.

19:51.320 --> 19:53.680
I thought I'd better call a friend.

19:54.160 --> 19:55.760
-Good idea.
-You know?

19:57.880 --> 20:00.480
Listen, isn't being abroad...
a bit of a rip-off?

20:00.920 --> 20:02.360
I wouldn't
put it that way.

20:02.880 --> 20:04.080
So, a total rip-off?

20:04.160 --> 20:06.560
France', playing abroad
has many upsides.

20:06.960 --> 20:08.880
It's not like in Italy,
where soccer's an obsession.

20:08.960 --> 20:11.000
The game ends
at the 90th minute. Period.

20:11.760 --> 20:13.160
What do you do
during the week?

20:13.240 --> 20:15.280
If you want me to say
Rome is better

20:15.360 --> 20:17.040
tell me right away
and I'll oblige.

20:17.120 --> 20:20.560
-No, of course not. Don't get upset.
-All right.

20:20.720 --> 20:21.560
Bye-bye.

20:21.640 --> 20:22.600
Okay, bye.

20:25.680 --> 20:30.280
Listen, in India you could play
even one-legged.

20:30.360 --> 20:33.680
Not just five, ten minutes,
like with Spalletti.

20:33.760 --> 20:36.080
You need to play.
At your age you need to play.

20:36.160 --> 20:39.880
Alessa', I didn't even know
they had soccer in India.

20:40.640 --> 20:43.320
It sounds like something
for retired players, you know?

20:43.400 --> 20:45.520
Andrea was right.
You're prejudiced.

20:45.600 --> 20:47.040
You talked to Andrea?

20:47.480 --> 20:50.280
Andrea? No.
Haven't heard from him in ages.

20:51.080 --> 20:54.800
Listen, India is a lovely place.
Wonderful country.

20:54.880 --> 20:58.880
It's rich in culture,
bursting with spirituality.

21:00.800 --> 21:01.840
Can you eat that?

21:02.600 --> 21:04.240
-What?
-Spirituality.

21:05.480 --> 21:06.560
Good grief.

21:07.560 --> 21:08.880
France', come on.

21:09.000 --> 21:13.200
Speaking of food,
I learned to make chicken curry.

21:13.720 --> 21:16.160
It's good but so spicy.

21:16.560 --> 21:20.960
I can't eat it. I'd need
gallons of water on hand.

21:21.160 --> 21:24.160
-But I mean...
-Chicken curry?

21:27.040 --> 21:29.680
Alessa', you've turned me around.
I'll think about it.

21:29.760 --> 21:33.800
-If you need me, I'm here. Let me know.
-Bye, thanks.

21:34.920 --> 21:36.760
-So?
-So...

21:36.840 --> 21:41.120
I told him everything,
I also mentioned the chicken curry.

21:42.720 --> 21:44.520
What can I say?
He wavered for a moment.

22:17.280 --> 22:18.280
Hi.

22:24.920 --> 22:26.440
-Hey.
-Are you evicting me?

22:27.280 --> 22:30.080
-Didn't cross my mind.
-I didn't say I was leaving.

22:30.160 --> 22:33.280
I'm putting up
this year's jersey, the 24th.

22:33.360 --> 22:36.840
It's two days away,
I'm getting a head start. Is it straight?

22:41.880 --> 22:42.920
Huh, is it straight?

22:45.400 --> 22:46.760
It's straight.

22:49.520 --> 22:53.440
If you'd like, I can lower it
and cover the wall.

22:56.560 --> 23:01.480
-I think it's fine where it is.
-I agree. Leave it there.

23:03.760 --> 23:08.200
I'll fix it later.
It's a bit of a rush job.

23:08.280 --> 23:09.280
Sure.

23:09.880 --> 23:11.680
-Nice, huh?
-Nice.

23:12.720 --> 23:14.200
I'll wait for you on the bus.

23:14.280 --> 23:16.600
24 jerseys,
all of the Roma team.

23:16.680 --> 23:18.520
And not because
I lacked for opportunities.

23:18.600 --> 23:21.760
Ever since I was a kid, they've tried
to take me away from here.

23:23.160 --> 23:25.360
-Phone.
-Will you take it?

23:29.000 --> 23:30.120
I'll take it.

23:37.280 --> 23:38.320
Hello?

23:39.080 --> 23:40.120
Yes.

23:44.280 --> 23:45.360
Yes, hi.

23:46.520 --> 23:47.600
All right.

23:49.160 --> 23:50.680
All right, we'll be waiting for you.

23:51.720 --> 23:54.080
Good evening, then. Bye.

23:56.800 --> 23:58.960
Enzo, what is it? Who was it?

24:01.080 --> 24:03.840
A Milan team executive.
For Francesco.

24:04.600 --> 24:07.440
-What did he say?
-He's coming tomorrow.

24:07.560 --> 24:10.120
-Tomorrow?
-Give me a minute.

24:13.120 --> 24:14.080
Breathe.

24:15.040 --> 24:19.880
1988. Milan's coach at the time
was Arrigo Sacchi.

24:19.960 --> 24:21.680
He had a team
of world-class stars.

24:21.760 --> 24:25.880
I was just a kid playing
for Lodigiani, a small local team.

24:26.440 --> 24:27.840
Need I say more?

24:28.440 --> 24:31.160
President Berlusconi
is investing a lot in Milan.

24:31.240 --> 24:35.040
The Championship we just won
shows we're on the right track.

24:35.200 --> 24:38.280
Francesco
is destined for a huge career.

24:39.160 --> 24:41.320
You can be certain
that many will knock on your door.

24:41.640 --> 24:45.920
But we at Milan know
how to nurture his potential.

24:46.760 --> 24:50.520
It's just so unexpected,
I don't...

24:50.600 --> 24:54.920
These are important decisions,
Mr. Braida, that's all.

24:55.320 --> 24:58.560
As you can see,
we're a very close-knit family.

24:59.520 --> 25:00.560
I understand that, of course.

25:00.880 --> 25:03.360
If you think
it's too early for him to move

25:03.440 --> 25:06.280
we'll wait and leave him
with Lodigiani for another year.

25:07.960 --> 25:11.120
What matters to us is knowing
Francesco's headed our way.

25:11.720 --> 25:15.240
And to that end, we're putting
on the table... 150 million lire.

25:22.240 --> 25:23.480
They have a lot of money.

25:27.800 --> 25:29.640
Rationally, we should accept.

25:31.120 --> 25:35.240
I'm also very proud that they came
from Milan for Francesco.

25:36.120 --> 25:38.600
But on the other hand,
I wish they hadn't.

25:39.760 --> 25:40.760
Do you understand me?

25:41.840 --> 25:42.840
I really do.

25:45.040 --> 25:50.160
Francesco is so shy... All alone in Milan.
Can you imagine?

25:52.720 --> 25:54.000
He's still a kid.

25:55.600 --> 25:58.840
I don't know.
I really don't.

25:59.840 --> 26:01.360
I don't know either.

26:03.120 --> 26:05.680
We agree that his career's important.

26:05.760 --> 26:09.360
But at his age,
family's important too, isn't it?

26:09.440 --> 26:10.880
He's so young, so fragile.

26:12.200 --> 26:15.080
He said so himself,
that gentleman.

26:15.880 --> 26:19.800
Many will knock on our door, so...

26:21.600 --> 26:26.520
But it's a lot of money. Today.
'Cause in the future...

26:32.400 --> 26:33.920
We must talk to him.

26:35.400 --> 26:36.400
It's his life.

26:38.120 --> 26:41.560
What do you think?
I mean, what would you like to do?

26:42.440 --> 26:45.040
I... Mom, I don't know.
I mean...

26:45.120 --> 26:47.520
If we went...
I don't know, going alone...

26:47.800 --> 26:50.920
If we went together...
Being all alone, that's bad for you.

26:53.560 --> 26:55.120
You know what I think, France'?

26:56.080 --> 26:59.240
You have it so good here with Mom and Dad,
all warm and coddled.

26:59.320 --> 27:01.840
Why go to Milan?
Are we kidding?

27:01.920 --> 27:04.560
In fact, give him seconds.
He's looking thin.

27:05.360 --> 27:08.400
Did you wash your hands
after you touched that jersey?

27:09.080 --> 27:11.360
Many other such offers came.

27:11.920 --> 27:15.320
Even from the wildest dream
of any soccer player:

27:15.400 --> 27:16.320
Real Madrid.

27:16.520 --> 27:20.480
The best team in the world,
a cavalcade of top-tier players.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.040
So star-studded,
they call them the "galacticos".

27:23.840 --> 27:28.160
For those who don't know Spanish,
it means "galactic team".

27:28.280 --> 27:29.360
I was thinking...

27:32.280 --> 27:35.440
Had they offered me 12 billion a year
to play for Real Madrid...

27:35.520 --> 27:37.720
-Holy shit...
-I would have danced on the table.

27:37.800 --> 27:40.040
Yeah, but she's pregnant.
We aren't playing around here.

27:40.120 --> 27:41.200
They'll give you a private jet.

27:41.280 --> 27:44.560
The hell do I need a jet for?
Mom's taken the 709 bus at most.

27:44.640 --> 27:47.920
-Write that on the wing: "709".
-Should I write "Centocelle" on the ticket?

27:48.000 --> 27:50.240
Think about it, though.
You'd win it all there.

27:50.320 --> 27:52.120
Can you imagine
lifting the Champions cup?

27:52.200 --> 27:53.080
Not necessarily.

27:53.160 --> 27:55.280
-But you'd have a shot.
-Just like the other teams.

27:55.360 --> 27:58.400
-You could become captain.
-Captain to... Zidane!

27:58.480 --> 28:00.120
-Awesome.
-Beckham, Roberto Carlos.

28:00.200 --> 28:01.480
You'd be etched in history.

28:01.560 --> 28:04.360
You're only made captain
after two or three years. Don't...

28:04.440 --> 28:07.880
-I smell something good.
-Haven't you eaten already?

28:08.560 --> 28:11.200
-I want this, too.
-You just had coffee, Uncle.

28:12.840 --> 28:14.200
What do you say, Dad?

28:15.760 --> 28:17.840
Why go there?
You're so well off here.

28:18.360 --> 28:20.520
-He said it.
-You're asking him?

28:20.600 --> 28:24.080
He feels lost going
from Porta Metronia to Casal Palocco!

28:25.160 --> 28:28.760
A lot has been said.
That I didn't go because I'm lazy.

28:29.480 --> 28:31.320
Or feared not being
on their level.

28:31.800 --> 28:34.880
Or that I'm "just a big baby"
unable to leave his family.

28:38.920 --> 28:40.680
Maybe I did stay in Rome

28:40.960 --> 28:43.600
with the Roma team,
for all those reasons.

28:44.080 --> 28:48.720
But all those reasons together,
I swear, are not enough.

29:18.440 --> 29:19.760
O Captain, my captain!

29:23.920 --> 29:25.200
Daniele, sit down.

29:26.200 --> 29:29.800
Will you sit down?
All of you, sit down.

29:31.280 --> 29:32.840
O Captain, my captain!

29:32.920 --> 29:36.040
Mire, stop it, will you?
Won't you listen?

29:36.280 --> 29:40.240
-O Captain, my captain!
-Come on! Radja!

29:41.000 --> 29:42.280
Stop it, guys!

29:43.080 --> 29:46.640
-O Captain, my captain!
-What are you all doing? Sit down!

29:47.720 --> 29:50.160
-O Captain, my captain!
-Stop it!

29:50.240 --> 29:52.640
-O Captain, my captain.
-O Captain, my captain.

29:52.720 --> 29:55.360
You can't act like this.
Go sit down.

29:56.320 --> 30:00.840
Understood? Sit down!
Sit down, damn you!

30:03.880 --> 30:06.560
Enough! Are we clear?

30:07.360 --> 30:08.840
Are we clear?

30:12.000 --> 30:17.000
Don't you dare, Rudi.
You hear me? Sit down. Sit down!

30:18.720 --> 30:19.760
Thank you.

30:21.680 --> 30:22.640
Thank you.

30:31.600 --> 30:32.840
France'.

30:33.360 --> 30:34.480
Hey.

30:34.560 --> 30:38.360
-Where are the others?
-They're on the bus waiting for you.

30:46.640 --> 30:48.120
FOREVER TOTTI

30:58.080 --> 31:00.160
WRITE "TOTTI"... READ "ROMA"

31:04.240 --> 31:06.080
YOU'RE COOL, UNCLE CECCO!

31:06.160 --> 31:07.640
THERE'S ONLY ONE CAPTAIN

31:09.800 --> 31:11.240
TOTTI 4 EVER

31:13.800 --> 31:15.680
I GREW UP ON TOTTI

31:15.760 --> 31:17.720
600 GAMES

31:37.960 --> 31:39.120
Come on! Come on!

31:56.880 --> 32:01.120
WE ARE ROMA

32:13.760 --> 32:14.840
Everything fine?

32:16.600 --> 32:17.440
Yeah, fine.

32:17.520 --> 32:20.080
-Excited?
-As always.

32:27.760 --> 32:29.080
Do you remember?

32:30.040 --> 32:31.280
What do you think?

32:34.680 --> 32:36.800
I think we made it
special together, after all.

32:38.040 --> 32:39.200
What did you decide?

32:39.280 --> 32:41.600
Wait a minute.
We haven't even ordered water.

32:41.680 --> 32:43.000
I know, but if we're here

32:43.080 --> 32:45.400
you must have
something important to tell me.

32:46.160 --> 32:47.200
Well...

32:50.720 --> 32:52.960
-I'm renewing.
-I knew it.

32:55.400 --> 32:57.040
-Are you disappointed?
-No.

32:59.280 --> 33:01.840
I just wanted you
to think it over before deciding.

33:02.760 --> 33:05.640
Well, I did. My head hurts
from all the thinking.

33:06.560 --> 33:09.000
I'm with you, Francesco.
I will always be with you.

33:10.080 --> 33:11.840
It's just that
a year goes by quickly.

33:11.920 --> 33:15.440
And when this year is over,
you must be ready.

33:16.280 --> 33:20.240
I know. Look, I'm fine.
I still feel like a kid.

33:20.880 --> 33:24.080
Another season like the last,
I may get a chance at one more year.

33:24.160 --> 33:26.080
Maybe you will.
I hope so too, Francesco.

33:26.160 --> 33:28.640
I'm cheering for you.
All the way.

33:29.240 --> 33:31.120
But if that doesn't happen,
you must be ready.

33:31.560 --> 33:32.880
That goes without saying.

33:33.920 --> 33:36.600
Then... we'll see.

33:38.720 --> 33:41.560
-But maybe it will happen.
-Of course.

33:46.280 --> 33:48.040
I wonder if you can see
our home from here.

33:49.240 --> 33:50.920
I don't know. Maybe.

34:02.960 --> 34:04.080
MANAGER

34:25.200 --> 34:27.400
-Is there a gathering?
-Did you sign?

34:27.480 --> 34:28.360
I did.

34:28.440 --> 34:31.600
Is this your last year as a player?
Then you'll be an executive?

34:31.680 --> 34:34.880
Yes. I'm very happy.
It's a dream come true.

34:35.760 --> 34:38.800
Francesco, one last question.
What's beyond Rome for you?

34:39.160 --> 34:40.800
Orte, if I'm not mistaken.

34:45.800 --> 34:46.800
Don't listen to them.

34:47.200 --> 34:50.920
They say "just one year,"
and we'll let them say it.

34:53.000 --> 34:53.960
Hey, Isabel.

34:55.560 --> 34:59.400
When we're almost there,
I'll go wild and get another year.

35:03.280 --> 35:04.440
Maybe another two.

35:04.520 --> 35:07.680
-Yeah, as if.
-What do you mean, "as if"?

35:07.880 --> 35:11.840
You don't think Dad can make it?
You still don't know me.

35:13.240 --> 35:16.600
Don't count me out yet.
You really take after your mother!
