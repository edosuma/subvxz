And I only had to pretend
with one man.

13:59.907 --> 14:02.976
And he'd give me things,
he'd give me nice things.

14:03.076 --> 14:06.313
And then,
I'd want more nice things.

14:06.413 --> 14:09.049
And then I'd say nice things
to get nice things

14:09.149 --> 14:11.684
and then I'd feel like
I was owed nice things.

14:11.784 --> 14:13.853
And then I'd stop.

14:13.954 --> 14:15.889
Being honest about
how I really felt.

14:17.524 --> 14:21.528
And then he started saying
really horrible things.

14:21.628 --> 14:23.496
And he started saying
horrible things all the time.

14:26.033 --> 14:30.137
And it all started sounding
like white noise to me.

14:30.237 --> 14:33.040
And I'd give an inch,
I'd give an inch.

14:33.140 --> 14:34.674
and start to think
it was all normal

14:34.774 --> 14:36.343
but it wasn't normal.

14:36.443 --> 14:38.345
- I'm sorry.
- Wasn't normal at all.

14:39.546 --> 14:40.847

- Okay, your turn.

14:49.122 --> 14:51.091
- I should be going home.
- Oh, come on, Stuart.

14:51.191 --> 14:53.126
We're here to have fun.
Three shots.

14:53.226 --> 14:54.294
- I've gotta be home by si--
- Three shots.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.229
Come on, you don't...
You don't want to play?

14:57.897 --> 14:58.865
Come on, then we'll fuck.

14:58.966 --> 15:00.200

What the fuck did you just do?

16:04.097 --> 16:05.398
Put the gun on the ground.

16:07.167 --> 16:08.101
Put the gun on the ground,
then you can go home

16:08.201 --> 16:09.902
to your lovely wife
and your two kids.

16:10.003 --> 16:11.204
Put it on the ground.

16:13.040 --> 16:14.374
Okay.

We... We could still walk away.
I could still help you.

17:06.593 --> 17:08.161
If you kill me,
you'll be on your own.

17:09.262 --> 17:11.598
I don't need you.

17:11.698 --> 17:12.999
And I don't need your help.

17:13.100 --> 17:16.403
