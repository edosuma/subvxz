Well, not exactly
"straight" Starlight.

We've been popping
all around Equestria

have to walk.

last thing is real?

understanding of each other.

20:25.858 --> 20:27.291
He did it!

20:27.326 --> 20:29.460
He transformed!

20:29.495 --> 20:31.695
I always knew you
had it in you!

20:31.730 --> 20:34.598
Really? Because I thought you
said I was a lost cause

20:34.633 --> 20:36.934
and you were going to tell
Thorax he should kick me out.

20:37.803 --> 20:39.937
Starlight!

20:39.972 --> 20:42.273
How could you say that?

20:42.308 --> 20:43.841
Wha? that's...

20:43.876 --> 20:45.376
I mean...

20:45.411 --> 20:46.944
but you...

20:46.979 --> 20:50.014
Lucky for us, you
weren't a lost cause.

20:50.049 --> 20:52.650
Lucky for me, you
didn't give up on me.

[happy chatter]

20:56.755 --> 21:00.858
So... Glad everything
worked out.

21:00.893 --> 21:03.994
Yeah. Let's talk about how you
not only lead the Maulwurf

21:04.029 --> 21:08.399
to the hive, but also drove
my brother away from it?

21:08.434 --> 21:11.769
I am so sorry about that.

21:11.804 --> 21:14.905
But I would like to point out
that my admittedly terrible plan

21:14.940 --> 21:17.775
did bring everything
together in the end.

21:17.810 --> 21:19.843
Hey, do you guys want
to hear the story

21:19.878 --> 21:22.046
about how I used to make
Thorax hit himself?

21:22.081 --> 21:24.381
Absolutely. Yes. Right now!

21:24.416 --> 21:26.383
Well, when we were young,

21:26.418 --> 21:28.585
every changeling wanted
to be a warrior.

21:28.620 --> 21:30.421
Except for Thorax...

21:30.456 --> 21:32.690
He was a little weak..
but I had to protect...
