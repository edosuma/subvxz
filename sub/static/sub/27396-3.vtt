WEBVTT

00:01.627 --> 00:04.630
(indistinct chatter)

00:10.169 --> 00:11.971
There he is. Let's go.

00:12.005 --> 00:13.639
Oh, yeah. Here we go.
Let's do this.

00:13.673 --> 00:15.474
Oh, come on, you guys,
I'm eating here.

00:15.508 --> 00:17.811
Oh, Alara, this is now an
official Friday night tradition.

00:17.844 --> 00:19.879
-You cannot deprive us.
-Isaac,

00:19.913 --> 00:22.048
get your shiny butt over here.
It's go time.

00:22.081 --> 00:23.649
I still fail to comprehend

00:23.683 --> 00:25.651
the purpose of this ritual.

00:25.685 --> 00:27.353
We're circus animals, Isaac.

00:27.386 --> 00:28.855
-I hate to break it to you.
-OLIX: All right.

00:28.888 --> 00:30.824
Come on, everybody.
Place your bets.

00:30.857 --> 00:34.160
Use comscanner code
7-4-9-9-alpha-6.

00:34.193 --> 00:35.661
Hey, what's the score?

00:35.695 --> 00:37.663
Alara's won 16, Isaac's at 14.

00:37.697 --> 00:39.298
All right, let's just
get this over with.

00:39.332 --> 00:41.500
I have wagered on you,
Lieutenant.

00:41.534 --> 00:43.069
Do not fail me.

00:44.237 --> 00:45.671
And go.

00:45.705 --> 00:47.774
-Come on, Alara!
-(people shouting)

00:49.776 --> 00:52.511
Don't let me down!
Isaac!

00:52.545 --> 00:56.149
You are nothing!
Come on, concentrate!

00:56.182 --> 00:58.885
(shouting continues)

00:58.918 --> 01:00.920
(speaks alien language)

01:06.926 --> 01:08.161
MALE:
Isaac!

01:08.194 --> 01:09.729
FEMALE:
Alara!

01:09.763 --> 01:11.497
-(bones crack)
-(screams)

01:11.530 --> 01:13.366
(cheering, booing)

01:13.399 --> 01:15.769
Boom! And it's Isaac
for the win.

01:15.802 --> 01:18.104
(quietly):
God.

01:18.137 --> 01:19.739
What's the matter?

01:19.773 --> 01:22.876
-Alara, are you okay?
-Call Dr. Finn.

01:22.909 --> 01:25.979
I think my arm is broken.

01:28.447 --> 01:30.249
How's that?

01:30.283 --> 01:33.052
It's... much better, thanks.

01:33.086 --> 01:35.088
Well, it was a clean break,
so it should be fine

01:35.121 --> 01:36.790
in a half hour or so.

01:36.823 --> 01:39.826
Just don't put too much stress
on it before then.

01:40.894 --> 01:42.561
Claire, how did this happen?

01:42.595 --> 01:45.598
I mean, I know Isaac and I
are evenly matched,

01:45.631 --> 01:47.033
but to break my arm?

01:47.066 --> 01:49.268
In Earth gravity? I...

01:49.302 --> 01:51.704
Alara, uh...

01:51.737 --> 01:53.306
how have you been
feeling otherwise?

01:53.339 --> 01:55.909
Any unusual soreness
or inflammation?

01:55.942 --> 01:58.311
Yeah. I mean, maybe a little,

01:58.344 --> 02:01.114
but I've also been
working out more lately.

02:01.147 --> 02:03.082
Wh-Why?

02:03.116 --> 02:05.318
Well, your muscle mass
is down 20%.

02:05.351 --> 02:07.086
No.

02:07.120 --> 02:09.789
And your bone density
is down five percent.

02:11.024 --> 02:12.125
Alara...

02:13.159 --> 02:15.494
your strength is deteriorating.

02:22.936 --> 02:24.938
*

02:54.968 --> 02:56.970
*

03:31.837 --> 03:33.806
Physical deterioration
as a result

03:33.839 --> 03:35.808
of changes in gravity
is nothing new.

03:35.841 --> 03:38.544
It happened to the earliest
human astronauts.

03:38.577 --> 03:41.747
Even with extensive physical
training while in microgravity,

03:41.780 --> 03:44.750
muscle volume and peak power
inevitably decrease.

03:44.783 --> 03:46.385
Has it ever happened
with a Xelayan?

03:46.419 --> 03:48.754
There have been
several cases, yes.

03:48.787 --> 03:51.324
But the atrophy seems
to be affecting Alara

03:51.357 --> 03:52.725
at a faster rate than most,

03:52.758 --> 03:54.894
probably because
she left home so young.

03:54.928 --> 03:57.096
So, uh, what do I do?

03:57.130 --> 04:00.166
The good news is the effects
aren't permanent yet.

04:00.199 --> 04:02.268
If you can reacclimate
to Xelayan gravity,

04:02.301 --> 04:05.338
there's a 90% chance
you'll regain your strength.

04:05.371 --> 04:07.240
How would she reacclimate?

04:07.273 --> 04:09.775
She's gonna have to return
to her home planet.

04:09.808 --> 04:11.577
Well, for how long?

04:11.610 --> 04:13.012
Well, there's no way to know.

04:13.046 --> 04:14.413
There have been documented cases

04:14.447 --> 04:16.415
of Xelayans reacclimating
within weeks.

04:16.449 --> 04:19.685
-Some took longer.
-How much longer?

04:19.718 --> 04:21.687
Well, the longest
recovery period on record

04:21.720 --> 04:23.522
was about four years.

04:23.556 --> 04:27.793
And there was one subject
who never recovered.

04:27.826 --> 04:29.562
He never left Xelayah again.

04:29.595 --> 04:32.298
I'm not trying to scare you.

04:32.331 --> 04:34.033
I'm just giving you the data.

04:34.067 --> 04:36.902
And if I don't go back?

04:36.936 --> 04:41.774
In time, your body will adjust
fully to Earth normal gravity.

04:41.807 --> 04:44.877
After that, if you tried
to go back to Xelayah...

04:44.910 --> 04:47.146
Crushed like a grape.

04:47.180 --> 04:48.747
Without protection, yes.

04:48.781 --> 04:50.383
When would she have to leave?

04:50.416 --> 04:53.652
To maximize her chances?
Soon as possible.

05:04.463 --> 05:06.865
(grunts)

05:09.002 --> 05:10.603
-(sighs)
-(door chimes)

05:11.870 --> 05:13.506
Come in.

05:18.611 --> 05:20.013
(grunts)

05:22.281 --> 05:23.949
When I first got here,

05:23.983 --> 05:26.485
I could lift a hundred kilos
more than that.

05:26.519 --> 05:29.588
That's still a hell of a lot
better than the rest of us.

05:29.622 --> 05:32.158
(scoffs)

05:32.191 --> 05:34.027
Look, I have a thought. Okay?

05:34.060 --> 05:36.129
Now, whatever you decide to do,
I'm gonna support you.

05:36.162 --> 05:37.630
But if you did decide to stay...

05:37.663 --> 05:39.765
Then you'd have a security chief

05:39.798 --> 05:42.768
who could get beaten up
by a high schooler.

05:42.801 --> 05:44.870
Captain, look at me.

05:44.903 --> 05:47.173
We both know the only reason
I got this job

05:47.206 --> 05:48.607
is because I'm Xelayan.

05:48.641 --> 05:51.010
Alara, your skill set
as chief of security

05:51.044 --> 05:52.778
covers more
than just busting heads.

05:52.811 --> 05:54.180
We could expand your staff,

05:54.213 --> 05:55.814
give you as much manpower
as you need,

05:55.848 --> 05:57.850
but you would still
call the shots.

05:57.883 --> 06:00.319
Yeah, like they'd want
to take orders from me.

06:00.353 --> 06:02.788
-That's their job.
-They'd never respect me.

06:02.821 --> 06:06.292
And the ones who didn't resent
me would just feel sorry for me.

06:06.325 --> 06:09.995
I... I don't need
charity, Captain.

06:10.029 --> 06:12.065
So what are you gonna do?

06:12.098 --> 06:14.667
What else can I do?

06:15.901 --> 06:18.237
I'm going home.

06:18.271 --> 06:20.073
Well, who knows--

06:20.106 --> 06:23.242
maybe you'll recover
faster than anyone in history

06:23.276 --> 06:24.677
and you'll be back here
in a week.

06:24.710 --> 06:26.412
What if it's longer?

06:26.445 --> 06:29.982
Your job will be
waiting for you.

06:30.015 --> 06:32.218
What if it's...

06:32.251 --> 06:35.054
a lot longer?

06:35.088 --> 06:38.724
Just get better, okay?

06:57.543 --> 06:59.345
I'll say it again.

06:59.378 --> 07:01.880
Best-looking planet
in the Union.

07:04.717 --> 07:06.785
Alara.

07:08.887 --> 07:13.025
I just... I wanted to take
one last look at the bridge.

07:13.058 --> 07:14.760
How are you feeling?

07:19.598 --> 07:21.567
I'm gonna beat this.

07:21.600 --> 07:23.269
I promise.

07:23.302 --> 07:27.373
And I am going to come back
to you tougher than ever.

07:27.406 --> 07:29.308
I know you will.

07:29.342 --> 07:31.610
We're gonna miss you so much.

07:31.644 --> 07:34.079
I'm gonna miss you guys, too.

07:57.102 --> 07:59.071
Now entering atmosphere.

07:59.104 --> 08:01.440
Activating gravity shield.

08:04.343 --> 08:06.345
*

08:28.334 --> 08:30.336
*

08:33.406 --> 08:35.708
God, I just can't...

08:35.741 --> 08:38.311
I mean, look at that.

08:38.344 --> 08:40.379
Nothing like it.

08:42.581 --> 08:45.318
You know, it's places like this
that make me realize...

08:45.351 --> 08:48.554
God, I'm trash.
My family is trash.

08:55.394 --> 08:58.197
It's that one, straight ahead.

08:58.231 --> 09:00.065
Can I just park anywhere?

09:00.098 --> 09:02.668
Yeah, just park out front.

09:29.228 --> 09:31.096
Okay. Open the hatch.

09:41.274 --> 09:42.541
Alara!

09:42.575 --> 09:44.743
(laughs)

09:44.777 --> 09:45.744
-(grunts)
-(shouts)

09:45.778 --> 09:47.446
-Honey!
-Honey! Are you okay?

09:47.480 --> 09:49.882
ALARA (grunts):
Yeah.

09:49.915 --> 09:53.118
I'm fine. It's just the gravity.

09:53.151 --> 09:55.721
Looks like it's more serious
than we were told.

09:55.754 --> 09:58.757
Alara, are you sure you're okay?
I can have Dr. Finn sent down.

09:58.791 --> 10:00.559
We have doctors
on Xelayah, Captain.

10:00.593 --> 10:02.628
Far superior to any
you can provide.

10:02.661 --> 10:04.630
Dad, for God's sake.

10:04.663 --> 10:06.932
Oh, you were always
a fragile one. Poor thing.

10:06.965 --> 10:08.367
ED:
Mr. and Mrs. Kitan,

10:08.401 --> 10:10.403
it's no secret to anyone

10:10.436 --> 10:12.438
that Xelayans don't think much
of the military.

10:12.471 --> 10:14.540
But you should know
that your daughter

10:14.573 --> 10:18.076
has distinguished herself
beyond all expectations.

10:18.110 --> 10:20.078
She has saved a lot of lives.

10:20.112 --> 10:21.747
Including mine.

10:21.780 --> 10:23.549
ILDIS:
Yes, well, thanks

10:23.582 --> 10:25.618
for dropping her off.
We'll take it from here.

10:25.651 --> 10:27.920
Captain.

10:27.953 --> 10:30.055
Thank you.

10:30.088 --> 10:31.657
For everything.

10:31.690 --> 10:34.293
I'll see you soon.

10:34.327 --> 10:37.563
Thank you, Lieutenant.

10:37.596 --> 10:40.132
Come inside, sweetheart.

10:40.165 --> 10:41.767
You can lie down.

10:41.800 --> 10:43.802
(Alara grunts)

10:52.345 --> 10:55.147
It's no wonder she's so hard
on herself all the time.

10:55.180 --> 10:57.483
God, I'd like to punch
that guy in the face.

10:57.516 --> 10:59.318
All right, come on, let's go.

10:59.352 --> 11:04.122
Oh, hang on. I've always wanted
to try something on this planet.

11:04.156 --> 11:05.791
Brought this with me.

11:11.464 --> 11:13.098
Wow!

11:13.131 --> 11:15.868
Oh, man. Thank God
for gravity shields.

11:25.844 --> 11:28.013
-Hi, honey.
-Up and around?

11:28.046 --> 11:29.382
Feeling any better?

11:29.415 --> 11:31.049
Yes. Thanks.

11:31.083 --> 11:33.318
Wow, this looks great.

11:33.352 --> 11:35.187
DRENALA:
I hope you're hungry.

11:35.220 --> 11:36.955
I know, I'm late. Sorry.

11:36.989 --> 11:38.824
Hi, sweetie. Look who's here.

11:38.857 --> 11:42.027
Alara. Oh, my God.

11:42.060 --> 11:44.397
-Hi, hon.
-Solana, hi.

11:44.430 --> 11:47.299
Uh, I thought you were out
on Jintann 8.

11:47.332 --> 11:49.535
-Jintann 9.
-I was,

11:49.568 --> 11:52.304
but the lab's all set up, and
they don't technically need me

11:52.337 --> 11:54.072
for a few days, so of course

11:54.106 --> 11:55.708
I'm gonna come see
my baby sister.

11:55.741 --> 11:57.175
Especially if she's sick.

11:57.209 --> 11:58.977
(sighs) I'm not sick.

11:59.011 --> 12:00.913
I was saying earlier,
she already looks

12:00.946 --> 12:02.681
healthier than she did
on the Orville.

12:02.715 --> 12:05.150
DRENALA: Well, that recycled air
wasn't doing you any favors.

12:05.183 --> 12:08.020
They worked you
way too hard out there.

12:08.053 --> 12:09.422
You always looked tired.

12:09.455 --> 12:10.889
I don't know how you did it.

12:10.923 --> 12:12.525
Cooped up on that ship
all the time?

12:12.558 --> 12:14.393
I would lose my mind.

12:14.427 --> 12:16.161
Actually, the Orville's great.

12:16.194 --> 12:18.030
I like working there.

12:20.766 --> 12:24.202
Well, now that you're back,

12:24.236 --> 12:26.271
the important thing
is to stay busy.

12:26.304 --> 12:28.340
In fact, this could be
the perfect time

12:28.373 --> 12:31.109
for you to go back to school,
get your degree.

12:31.143 --> 12:33.078
I'm not gonna be here that long.

12:33.111 --> 12:34.379
Well, honey,
you don't know that.

12:34.413 --> 12:36.682
ILDIS: If you're worried
about competing,

12:36.715 --> 12:38.016
I've already talked to some of

12:38.050 --> 12:39.752
the professors
at the university.

12:39.785 --> 12:41.920
They know you're going to need
a little extra attention,

12:41.954 --> 12:43.922
but they are all up
for the challenge.

12:43.956 --> 12:45.891
Oh, thanks.

12:47.059 --> 12:48.894
SOLANA:
Is gravity readjustment

12:48.927 --> 12:50.429
kind of different for everybody?

12:50.463 --> 12:51.897
Because I was reading
that some people

12:51.930 --> 12:53.732
take a really long time
to recover.

12:53.766 --> 12:55.400
You know, it'd be
really great if everyone

12:55.434 --> 12:57.503
could just stop rooting
for me to fail.

13:00.305 --> 13:03.709
(sighs) I'm... I'm sorry.

13:03.742 --> 13:06.445
It's just... look,
even if I were staying,

13:06.479 --> 13:07.980
I'm not going back to school.

13:11.349 --> 13:15.454
Honey, why don't you tell her
about you and Terlus?

13:15.488 --> 13:18.223
-What is it?
-We're getting married.

13:18.256 --> 13:20.225
You are?

13:20.258 --> 13:22.628
That's amazing. Congratulations.

13:22.661 --> 13:24.630
Took him long enough to propose.

13:24.663 --> 13:27.265
You'll be my maid of honor,
of course.

13:27.299 --> 13:29.668
And now that you're home,
who knows--

13:29.702 --> 13:32.838
maybe you'll have some luck
in the romance department.

13:32.871 --> 13:34.773
(chuckles)

13:38.110 --> 13:40.112
*

13:58.130 --> 13:59.832
(door chimes)

13:59.865 --> 14:02.034
Come in.

14:04.837 --> 14:07.039
Enjoying your old room?

14:07.072 --> 14:08.874
It's like a flashback.

14:08.907 --> 14:10.943
You hardly changed anything.

14:10.976 --> 14:13.045
Yes, well, we always knew
you'd come back.

14:13.078 --> 14:16.148
-Or at least we hoped.
-Because you missed me?

14:16.181 --> 14:19.317
Of course we missed you.
And we want what's best for you.

14:19.351 --> 14:23.021
(chuckles) God, you just
can't help yourself, can you?

14:23.055 --> 14:24.189
What?

14:24.222 --> 14:25.457
Did you ever stop to think

14:25.490 --> 14:26.992
that maybe there
are people who might

14:27.025 --> 14:28.894
possibly prefer
a different lifestyle than you?

14:28.927 --> 14:32.130
Or is that just completely
beyond your ability to imagine?

14:32.164 --> 14:35.300
Look, sweetheart...

14:35.333 --> 14:38.537
you were born with certain...
disadvantages.

14:38.571 --> 14:41.073
-(chuckles)
-We both know if you hadn't been

14:41.106 --> 14:43.041
slower than the other children,

14:43.075 --> 14:45.243
you wouldn't have felt trapped
into joining the fleet.

14:45.277 --> 14:47.746
Dad, I was well aware
of my intellectual weaknesses.

14:47.780 --> 14:50.482
I had you to remind me
every day.

14:50.515 --> 14:51.884
What, was I supposed
to lie to you?

14:51.917 --> 14:53.151
You're my daughter.

14:53.185 --> 14:55.353
Yeah, exactly.
I'm your daughter.

14:55.387 --> 14:57.355
You're supposed to offer me--
I-I don't know--

14:57.389 --> 14:58.657
encouragement, support.

14:58.691 --> 15:00.158
Things a father
is supposed to do.

15:00.192 --> 15:02.060
Now, hold on, that's not fair.

15:02.094 --> 15:04.229
Your mother and I did the best
we could with you.

15:04.262 --> 15:05.931
Oh, the best you could. Wow.

15:05.964 --> 15:08.200
I am sorry I was such a project.

15:08.233 --> 15:10.502
We put in a lot of time
and a lot of energy.

15:10.535 --> 15:13.071
Do you know why?
Because we love you.

15:13.105 --> 15:15.507
It broke our hearts
to see you join the military.

15:15.540 --> 15:17.876
Those people inspired me
more in a year

15:17.910 --> 15:19.578
than anyone on Xelayah did
my entire life.

15:19.612 --> 15:21.046
Now, that is
the gravity sickness talking.

15:21.079 --> 15:22.948
No, Dad, that's me talking!

15:22.981 --> 15:25.117
Open your stupid ears
and listen.

15:25.150 --> 15:28.020
All I ever needed to hear
from you was, "You can do it."

15:28.053 --> 15:30.122
That's all. Just once.

15:30.155 --> 15:33.358
And-and maybe it would've been
a lie, but I needed that, Dad.

15:33.391 --> 15:35.393
I really needed it.

15:35.427 --> 15:37.395
And do you know who said it
to me instead?

15:37.429 --> 15:39.364
Captain Mercer,
Commander Grayson

15:39.397 --> 15:41.133
and everyone on the Orville,

15:41.166 --> 15:43.802
but not my own father.

15:48.240 --> 15:50.375
The doctor doesn't know how long

15:50.408 --> 15:51.944
you're going to be
in that chair.

15:51.977 --> 15:54.379
Your mother and I
have decided that a trip

15:54.412 --> 15:57.315
out to the beach house
might do us all some good.

15:57.349 --> 15:59.217
Pull the family back together.

15:59.251 --> 16:02.154
Trip to the beach
isn't gonna fix 20 years.

16:12.264 --> 16:14.667
(sighs)

16:14.700 --> 16:16.702
*

16:25.443 --> 16:27.445
*

16:53.638 --> 16:55.841
*

17:08.987 --> 17:11.724
-SERRIS: Hello, hello.
-DRENALA: Hi, Serris.

17:11.757 --> 17:14.126
I've got the house
all set up for you.

17:14.159 --> 17:15.560
Thank you.
Anything we need to know?

17:15.593 --> 17:16.829
The island is all yours.

17:16.862 --> 17:18.831
Deserted for the off-season.

17:18.864 --> 17:20.498
I'm headed back to the mainland,

17:20.532 --> 17:22.667
but don't hesitate to contact me
if you need anything.

17:22.701 --> 17:24.837
Thank you so much.
My best to your family.

17:24.870 --> 17:26.671
Thank you, sir.

17:28.006 --> 17:30.542
Alara! Look!

17:39.885 --> 17:41.586
(both chuckle)

17:41.619 --> 17:43.889
It's so beautiful.

17:43.922 --> 17:46.458
I haven't seen
a wild eevek in ages.

17:52.397 --> 17:54.399
*

18:15.153 --> 18:17.555
*

18:45.583 --> 18:47.585
*

18:56.261 --> 18:58.563
-Hi, honey.
-Didn't Serris say we're

18:58.596 --> 18:59.898
the only ones on the island
right now?

18:59.932 --> 19:01.566
Yes.

19:01.599 --> 19:04.669
I saw a light on in one
of the houses down the beach.

19:04.702 --> 19:06.438
Well, maybe someone else

19:06.471 --> 19:08.406
wanted to take advantage
of the off-season.

19:08.440 --> 19:10.809
It's so peaceful here
when it isn't crowded.

19:10.843 --> 19:13.078
(chuckling):
I can hardly blame them.

19:13.111 --> 19:14.779
(sighs) So what do we think?

19:14.813 --> 19:17.916
-Bedtime?
-Absolutely. I'm exhausted.

19:17.950 --> 19:19.517
(Ildis sighs)

19:22.287 --> 19:24.289
*

19:42.640 --> 19:45.010
*

20:01.259 --> 20:04.897
So, short-term request
for a DNA specialist in medical,

20:04.930 --> 20:08.500
staff reviews in armory
and communications.

20:08.533 --> 20:10.135
Anything new in engineering?

20:10.168 --> 20:11.836
Nothing departmental,

20:11.870 --> 20:13.906
but Yaphit's six-month
evaluation was last week

20:13.939 --> 20:16.508
and he asked what
our parental leave policy is.

20:16.541 --> 20:18.476
Why? Is he thinking
of splitting in half?

20:18.510 --> 20:20.145
We can't legally ask him that.

20:20.178 --> 20:22.514
-(door chimes)
-Come in.

20:24.182 --> 20:27.019
Captain, the interim
security chief has arrived.

20:27.052 --> 20:30.355
-Okay. Send him in.
-Aye, sir.

20:33.425 --> 20:35.360
You miss her, don't you?

20:35.393 --> 20:38.330
I just hope she's okay.

20:38.363 --> 20:40.232
Yeah.

20:40.265 --> 20:42.567
-(door chimes)
-Come in.

20:44.402 --> 20:46.338
Lieutenant Tharl
reporting for duty.

20:46.371 --> 20:48.273
Tharl, come on in.

20:48.306 --> 20:51.076
This ship is totally sick, man.

20:51.109 --> 20:52.677
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

20:52.710 --> 20:54.612
I was checking it out
on the way up here.

20:54.646 --> 20:56.414
I'm like,
"Man, this is bitchin'."

20:56.448 --> 20:57.849
I like all the carpets.

20:57.882 --> 20:59.751
Your references are terrific.

20:59.784 --> 21:01.586
You come very
highly recommended.

21:01.619 --> 21:05.190
Yeah, my last captain
had a total boner for me.

21:05.223 --> 21:07.625
Not a boner-boner.
A professional boner.

21:07.659 --> 21:10.895
Um, we only have standard-issue
uniforms on board,

21:10.929 --> 21:13.398
so if you need
something specific...

21:13.431 --> 21:15.867
No, it's all good.
I got a few of these.

21:15.900 --> 21:18.536
So... can I take my station?

21:18.570 --> 21:20.572
Yes. I'll show you
to the bridge.

21:21.639 --> 21:22.975
Hey, what is that?

21:23.008 --> 21:25.277
Uh, Kermit the Frog.

21:25.310 --> 21:27.645
Sick.

21:44.029 --> 21:45.897
No, don't help me.

21:45.930 --> 21:48.833
I'm not. I'm here just in case.

21:51.869 --> 21:53.905
Alara, you're doing great.

21:53.938 --> 21:55.940
(grunts)

21:55.974 --> 21:57.675
Not great enough.

21:57.709 --> 22:00.979
No. That was so much better
than yesterday.

22:06.351 --> 22:08.686
Hello. May I help you?

22:08.720 --> 22:10.288
Yes. Hi.

22:10.322 --> 22:12.190
I'm Cambis Borrin,
and this is my wife, Floratta.

22:12.224 --> 22:14.292
We own the gray house
just up the beach,

22:14.326 --> 22:15.660
the one with
the silver railings.

22:15.693 --> 22:17.962
Oh, yes.
That's a beautiful home.

22:17.996 --> 22:19.697
-Thank you.
-Come on in.

22:19.731 --> 22:21.333
-Thank you.
-I'm Drenala,

22:21.366 --> 22:23.768
and these are my daughters,
Solana and Alara.

22:23.801 --> 22:26.804
Hi. We're so sorry
to bother you.

22:26.838 --> 22:28.973
We just arrived this morning,

22:29.007 --> 22:31.043
and we think someone's
been in our house.

22:31.076 --> 22:33.045
So we were wondering
if you'd noticed

22:33.078 --> 22:36.281
-anyone or anything unusual.
-Someone broke into your house?

22:36.314 --> 22:38.516
Well, we don't know for sure,
but we think so.

22:38.550 --> 22:40.118
Was there any sign
of forced entry?

22:40.152 --> 22:42.987
No. No, not that we saw,
but when we got inside,

22:43.021 --> 22:45.890
it looked as if several items
had been moved around,

22:45.923 --> 22:47.892
like someone was looking
for something.

22:47.925 --> 22:50.195
-Was anything missing?
-Well, not that we could see.

22:50.228 --> 22:51.363
Did you call the police?

22:51.396 --> 22:52.864
Oh, of course.
They came right away.

22:52.897 --> 22:54.299
Did they scan for DNA?

22:54.332 --> 22:57.001
I'm actually not sure.

22:57.035 --> 22:59.471
Alara was a security officer
on board a Union starship.

22:59.504 --> 23:01.906
Am. Not was.

23:01.939 --> 23:03.741
I know that it's the off-season,

23:03.775 --> 23:06.211
but do you know if there's
anyone else on the island?

23:06.244 --> 23:07.745
Our caretaker
was here yesterday,

23:07.779 --> 23:09.747
but he already left
for the mainland.

23:09.781 --> 23:12.717
Forgive me for asking,
but how well do you know him?

23:12.750 --> 23:15.187
Serris?
He's been with us for years.

23:15.220 --> 23:17.689
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to imply anything.

23:17.722 --> 23:20.158
We're just, uh,
a little bit rattled.

23:20.192 --> 23:23.228
No, it's fine.
I mean, I'm happy to call.

23:23.261 --> 23:25.363
Thank you.

23:25.397 --> 23:27.765
(comm chiming)

23:32.204 --> 23:35.207
No answer.

23:35.240 --> 23:36.908
Why don't I go check
his cottage?

23:36.941 --> 23:38.576
Oh, honey, no.
Not in your condition.

23:38.610 --> 23:41.012
Mom, it's what I do.

23:41.045 --> 23:42.980
I can go with her.

24:11.976 --> 24:13.978
Hey, you know, Tharl,
you can, uh,

24:14.011 --> 24:16.714
take a break if you want,
go eat in the mess hall.

24:16.748 --> 24:18.516
Oh, yeah, I'm good.
I like to work through lunch.

24:19.917 --> 24:23.321
May I ask, what is that?

24:23.355 --> 24:24.756
This? It's stew.

24:24.789 --> 24:26.991
No, your appendage.

24:27.024 --> 24:29.627
Oh, yeah. This is my esophagus.

24:29.661 --> 24:32.397
My species has
a crazy high metabolism,

24:32.430 --> 24:34.566
so we evolved two esophaguses--

24:34.599 --> 24:36.401
one on the inside,
one on the outside--

24:36.434 --> 24:38.703
so we can just pound food.

24:39.771 --> 24:41.673
Just pound it.

24:46.043 --> 24:50.114
Bam. Taking the tube
to Tummy Town.

24:50.148 --> 24:53.151
Captain, Commander,
we have an idea.

24:53.185 --> 24:55.853
-About what?
-It's about Alara.

24:55.887 --> 24:58.122
We may have figured out
a way to help her.

24:58.156 --> 25:00.758
Now, there are
no guarantees, but...

25:00.792 --> 25:02.527
can you come to Simulator 3?

25:02.560 --> 25:04.329
Bortus, you have the conn.

25:19.744 --> 25:24.115
So... any cute guys
on that ship?

25:24.148 --> 25:25.750
Some, yeah.

25:27.752 --> 25:29.554
Cool.

25:32.324 --> 25:35.727
Your life must be
pretty interesting out there.

25:35.760 --> 25:37.629
You could say that.

25:37.662 --> 25:40.632
You know,

25:40.665 --> 25:42.834
I kind of envy you.

25:42.867 --> 25:45.703
You envy me?

25:45.737 --> 25:47.639
Yeah.

25:47.672 --> 25:50.708
I mean, I know we haven't talked
that much in the past year,

25:50.742 --> 25:52.544
but every time we did,

25:52.577 --> 25:55.179
you always had
some crazy, wild story

25:55.213 --> 25:58.182
about something you'd seen
or some new place you'd been.

25:58.216 --> 26:00.385
Well, there's a lot to tell.

26:00.418 --> 26:02.687
-I mean, two-dimensional space?
-(chuckles)

26:02.720 --> 26:05.690
I can't even imagine
what that must have been like.

26:05.723 --> 26:07.925
I thought you guys
hated the military.

26:08.960 --> 26:10.562
I have a theory.

26:10.595 --> 26:13.731
I think the soldiers
and the intellectuals

26:13.765 --> 26:16.067
all secretly want
what the other has.

26:16.100 --> 26:18.403
The muscle wants the brains,

26:18.436 --> 26:20.538
and the brains wish
they had what it takes

26:20.572 --> 26:24.008
to clobber the barroom drunk
who gets out of line.

26:24.041 --> 26:26.043
Why can't a person have both?

26:27.945 --> 26:31.349
I guess a lot of us
look at people like you

26:31.383 --> 26:34.719
and we think that we're better,
more evolved.

26:34.752 --> 26:36.554
(chuckles) But...

26:36.588 --> 26:39.457
you know I'm proud of you, sis.

26:43.328 --> 26:45.330
*

26:57.809 --> 27:00.978
*

27:15.159 --> 27:16.661
What is all this?

27:16.694 --> 27:18.896
It's all of Serris' stuff.

27:18.930 --> 27:21.265
He never left.

27:22.367 --> 27:24.702
He must still be on the island.

27:38.516 --> 27:41.285
Ildis, how much longer is this
gonna take? We're starving.

27:41.319 --> 27:44.021
Trivalve sauce
is a delicate thing.

27:44.055 --> 27:46.758
You can't eat it
before it's completely boiled.

27:46.791 --> 27:48.593
-He thinks he's
a celebrity chef.
-(laughter)

27:48.626 --> 27:50.362
Drenala,
thank you again for this.

27:50.395 --> 27:51.663
Oh, please,
I wouldn't want to go

27:51.696 --> 27:53.431
back to that house tonight,
either.

27:53.465 --> 27:56.000
Well, we're gonna head across
to the mainland tomorrow.

27:56.033 --> 27:58.603
Do you think Serris
could've done something?

27:58.636 --> 28:00.438
Well, if we don't
hear from him by morning,

28:00.472 --> 28:02.273
-I'm calling the police.
-At least it's the off-season.

28:02.306 --> 28:04.275
If they do need
to search for him,

28:04.308 --> 28:05.510
they'll have an easier time.

28:05.543 --> 28:07.278
That is true.

28:07.311 --> 28:09.447
The high season
always so crowded.

28:09.481 --> 28:11.282
You can actually see
sand and water now

28:11.315 --> 28:12.717
instead of umbrellas and towels.

28:12.750 --> 28:14.185
(laughter)

28:14.218 --> 28:16.053
FLORATTA: Oh, I do like
the crowds sometimes.

28:16.087 --> 28:18.189
Our house is usually
just the two of us.

28:18.222 --> 28:19.691
It can get a little lonely.

28:19.724 --> 28:20.992
Do you have children?

28:21.025 --> 28:22.794
We do-- a son.

28:22.827 --> 28:25.029
He's so busy, though, he can't
usually can't find the time

28:25.062 --> 28:26.831
-to join us out here.
-ILDIS: How old is he?

28:26.864 --> 28:29.333
FLORATTA: Oh, he just turned 30.
He had a birthday last week.

28:29.367 --> 28:31.403
Oh, that's great.
Did you do anything fun?

28:31.436 --> 28:33.571
No, no, no. Galdus isn't
a birthday kind of guy.

28:33.605 --> 28:35.206
Very serious.

28:35.239 --> 28:38.410
Doesn't really like when
he's the center of attention.

28:38.443 --> 28:40.845
Except when he's teaching,
of course.

28:40.878 --> 28:43.347
Oh, where does he teach?

28:43.381 --> 28:44.749
He is an associate professor

28:44.782 --> 28:46.384
at the University of Xenara
Medical School.

28:46.418 --> 28:48.152
Really? I've done a few stints

28:48.185 --> 28:50.187
as a visiting lecturer there
over the years.

28:50.221 --> 28:51.889
-Lovely campus.
-FLORATTA: It is.

28:51.923 --> 28:54.091
It's beautiful. Galdus loves it.

28:54.125 --> 28:56.528
CAMBIS: Yes, he started teaching
there when he was just 21.

28:56.561 --> 28:57.829
-Bit of a prodigy.
-Mm-hmm.

28:57.862 --> 28:59.230
Not to brag or anything.

28:59.263 --> 29:00.998
Oh, please, brag away.

29:01.032 --> 29:03.835
Talking about Solana's PhD
is our favorite topic.

29:03.868 --> 29:05.437
-(laughter)
-SOLANA: Come on, Mom.

29:05.470 --> 29:06.904
-DRENALA: It's true.
-(device chimes)

29:06.938 --> 29:09.674
Oh, yes, there we go.
The sauce is ready.

29:09.707 --> 29:10.875
Oh, finally.

29:10.908 --> 29:12.343
CAMBIS:
I can't wait to try it.

29:12.376 --> 29:13.377
Here, give me your plate.

29:13.411 --> 29:14.546
You'll have to let me know

29:14.579 --> 29:16.380
if it's spicy enough.

29:16.414 --> 29:19.517
-Is that ladle clean?
-Yes, of course it is.

29:19.551 --> 29:20.718
It looks a little dirty.

29:21.886 --> 29:23.921
No, it's fine, I promise.

29:23.955 --> 29:26.257
Just the same, maybe you could
use something else.

29:26.290 --> 29:28.359
Okay, uh,

29:28.392 --> 29:31.395
I'm sure I must have a spoon
around here somewhere.

29:31.429 --> 29:33.064
Why don't you use your hand?

29:34.265 --> 29:35.600
(laughter)

29:35.633 --> 29:38.903
-Right.
-I mean it.

29:38.936 --> 29:41.606
What are you talking about?
It's boiling hot.

29:41.639 --> 29:44.742
Use your hand.

29:44.776 --> 29:46.644
What the hell is this?

29:46.678 --> 29:48.813
Okay, what is going on,
and who are you?

29:48.846 --> 29:53.384
I'm a hungry man asking my host
to serve him some trivalve sauce

29:53.417 --> 29:55.419
with his hand.

29:57.088 --> 29:59.457
-Ildis.
-Mom, sit down.

30:00.492 --> 30:02.159
Better do as you're told.

30:02.193 --> 30:04.529
Ildis.

30:25.449 --> 30:28.052
(Ildis screaming)

30:33.525 --> 30:36.628
Oh, I would say
that is indeed spicy enough.

30:47.338 --> 30:49.140
FLORATTA:
Look what I found.

30:49.173 --> 30:51.175
Frizzian champagne?

30:51.208 --> 30:53.444
Oh, Ildis, you've been
holding out on us.

30:53.477 --> 30:55.680
Saving this
for higher-class company?

30:55.713 --> 30:57.749
Listen,
whatever it is you want...

30:59.884 --> 31:02.554
Shut up, Ildis.

31:02.587 --> 31:05.022
I propose a toast, sweetie.

31:05.056 --> 31:07.625
To Galdus' birthday.

31:07.659 --> 31:10.494
Happy birthday
to our little boy.

31:12.363 --> 31:14.498
Mmm.

31:14.532 --> 31:18.235
It's too bad Galdus can't share
this wonderful champagne,

31:18.269 --> 31:21.305
but he died last year.

31:21.338 --> 31:22.974
Suicide.

31:23.007 --> 31:26.410
But you were just talking
about him earlier.

31:26.443 --> 31:29.080
FLORATTA: I can see how
that would be misleading.

31:29.113 --> 31:31.315
We talk about Galdus often.

31:31.348 --> 31:33.985
I'm so sorry about your son.

31:34.018 --> 31:35.987
That must be terrible,
to lose a child.

31:36.020 --> 31:38.155
It is.

31:38.189 --> 31:41.525
The worst pain a parent
could ever imagine.

31:41.559 --> 31:43.828
He held on for a while,
as long as he could,

31:43.861 --> 31:46.263
a few years, actually,
after you destroyed his career,

31:46.297 --> 31:48.700
destroyed his life.

31:48.733 --> 31:50.702
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

31:50.735 --> 31:52.604
Professor Ildis Kitan.

31:52.637 --> 31:54.438
Author of a paper
first published

31:54.471 --> 31:56.073
in the Xelayan Journal
of Science,

31:56.107 --> 31:58.075
"The Mellara Vaccine
and Its Effects

31:58.109 --> 32:01.112
on the Risk of Torin's Syndrome:
A Formal Dispute."

32:01.145 --> 32:02.546
Galdus Harona.

32:02.580 --> 32:05.349
Ah, it all comes back to him.

32:05.382 --> 32:06.718
Dad, who is he?

32:06.751 --> 32:08.452
A medical researcher,

32:08.485 --> 32:10.788
a very outspoken opponent
of the Mellara vaccine.

32:10.822 --> 32:13.424
Galdus' research revealed
that the vaccine

32:13.457 --> 32:15.760
was putting children at risk
of Torin's Syndrome.

32:15.793 --> 32:17.762
He published his findings,

32:17.795 --> 32:19.764
was on the verge of becoming
a household name

32:19.797 --> 32:23.534
for exposing the dangers,
for protecting the children.

32:23.567 --> 32:25.803
Please listen to me
very carefully.

32:25.837 --> 32:28.439
I never set out
to deliberately ruin your son.

32:28.472 --> 32:29.874
It wasn't personal.

32:29.907 --> 32:31.475
It was about the science.

32:31.508 --> 32:34.045
His methodology was flawed.
Incomplete.

32:34.078 --> 32:36.580
Every credible researcher
in the field knew it.

32:36.614 --> 32:39.250
He needed more peer review.
He was wrong about...

32:39.283 --> 32:42.119
No, no, no.
You were wrong.

32:42.153 --> 32:44.321
And you are going to admit
that you were wrong.

32:44.355 --> 32:46.658
Your son was a very smart man.

32:46.691 --> 32:49.393
Too smart to rush publication
of his research without...

32:49.426 --> 32:51.095
You are going to renounce
your position.

32:51.128 --> 32:52.730
Thousands of people would've
died without that vaccine.

32:52.764 --> 32:54.899
You are going to tell the world
that you lied.

32:54.932 --> 32:56.267
He was right.
You were wrong.

32:56.300 --> 32:59.103
And you can't
live with the guilt anymore.

32:59.136 --> 33:01.338
-Sweetie.
-ILDIS: This is insane.

33:01.372 --> 33:03.941
I will not go on record
declaring a vaccine is dangerous

33:03.975 --> 33:05.176
when it isn't.

33:05.209 --> 33:07.912
All right.
All right.

33:07.945 --> 33:09.480
I-I'll do it.

33:09.513 --> 33:11.115
Dad, the second you make
that retraction,

33:11.148 --> 33:13.685
they'll have no reason
to keep any of us alive.

33:16.620 --> 33:18.823
(sighs)

33:18.856 --> 33:21.993
All right. That does create
a bit of a stalemate,

33:22.026 --> 33:23.527
yes. (chuckles)

33:23.560 --> 33:26.864
Sweetie, it seems we need
a less absolute incentive.

33:26.898 --> 33:29.366
I have an idea.

33:29.400 --> 33:32.737
Ildis, I noticed you have
a lovely garden.

33:40.812 --> 33:43.647
-Solana, your hand, please.
-No, no, please.

33:43.681 --> 33:46.718
-Please don't. I...
-Your hand or your head.

33:50.587 --> 33:52.023
(cries)

33:53.991 --> 33:56.193
Which one, sweetie?

33:56.227 --> 33:59.363
Don't do this.
I'll make the statement.

33:59.396 --> 34:01.632
-I'll say what...
-I know you will, Ildis,

34:01.665 --> 34:03.801
but I do want you
to have a small taste

34:03.835 --> 34:06.003
of what it feels like
to watch your child suffer.

34:07.872 --> 34:10.074
Let's start with the little one.

34:16.781 --> 34:18.716
(whimpers)

34:26.057 --> 34:28.025
-(screams)
-(spaceship whooshing)

34:35.399 --> 34:37.935
It's a Union shuttle.
What have you done?

34:37.969 --> 34:39.536
-Nothing. I swear.
-Who is it?

34:39.570 --> 34:42.073
-I swear, I don't know.
-The point is, they're here.

34:42.106 --> 34:44.541
If I were you, I'd make a break
for it while you still can.

34:46.043 --> 34:49.213
Come here. Come here.
Sweetie.

34:50.247 --> 34:51.715
Get rid of them.

34:57.154 --> 34:59.590
Nobody makes a sound.

35:05.963 --> 35:07.531
Professor Kitan,

35:07.564 --> 35:10.134
I'm sorry to just drop in
unannounced like this,

35:10.167 --> 35:12.136
but your comm seems to be down.

35:12.169 --> 35:14.405
Yes, we've been having
some trouble with it.

35:14.438 --> 35:17.474
-Should be repaired by tomorrow.
-Well, I need to speak to Alara.

35:17.508 --> 35:19.443
Uh, she's resting right now.

35:19.476 --> 35:21.145
The gravity's
been getting to her,

35:21.178 --> 35:22.814
but we'll let her know
you were here.

35:22.847 --> 35:25.149
-She'll call you tomorrow.
-It's very important

35:25.182 --> 35:26.918
that I talk to her.
I promise you

35:26.951 --> 35:29.720
-she's gonna want to hear
what I have to say.
-I'm sorry,

35:29.753 --> 35:31.422
it's not a good time.

35:31.455 --> 35:33.390
Look, Ildis,

35:33.424 --> 35:35.793
I know you don't think much
of me or the fleet,

35:35.827 --> 35:37.628
but please believe me
when I tell you

35:37.661 --> 35:40.731
that I care about your daughter
just as much as you do.

35:40.764 --> 35:42.967
Now, I need to speak to her
right away,

35:43.000 --> 35:45.036
and I'm not leaving until I do.

35:48.672 --> 35:50.207
(grunts, pants)

35:57.281 --> 35:59.650
(grunting)

36:21.973 --> 36:23.875
-Everyone get upstairs
and lock the doors.
-Alara, what-what...

36:23.908 --> 36:25.776
Dad, get 'em upstairs now!

36:25.809 --> 36:27.244
Come on. Go.

36:34.151 --> 36:35.686
(grunts)

36:41.758 --> 36:44.495
(panting)

36:51.502 --> 36:52.803
Ed!

36:52.836 --> 36:54.238
Ed, can you hear me?

36:54.271 --> 36:56.807
Yeah. I can't move.

36:56.840 --> 36:59.110
Contact the Orville.

37:02.013 --> 37:04.381
Ed, I'm reading a problem
with your gravity field.

37:04.415 --> 37:05.849
Check your gauge.

37:06.850 --> 37:09.053
Power's low.

37:09.086 --> 37:10.821
It must have been
overloaded by the shot.

37:10.854 --> 37:12.556
Malloy to Orville.

37:12.589 --> 37:13.991
Ed's gravity field
is malfunctioning.

37:14.025 --> 37:15.392
He's got about three minutes

37:15.426 --> 37:17.394
until the Xelayan gravity
gets through.

37:17.428 --> 37:19.396
(footsteps approach)

37:19.430 --> 37:21.933
(panting)

37:21.966 --> 37:24.435
Dad, I can take this guy,

37:24.468 --> 37:26.037
but I need you to go help Ed.

37:26.070 --> 37:28.572
-What?
-You have to go over the balcony

37:28.605 --> 37:30.141
and get him inside the shuttle.

37:31.142 --> 37:33.044
What...

37:33.077 --> 37:36.380
-What is it?
-Can't you go?

37:36.413 --> 37:39.583
My legs are about to give out
on me. I won't make it.

37:39.616 --> 37:43.220
Dad, you can do this.

37:43.254 --> 37:45.822
Okay? You can do it.

37:48.225 --> 37:49.626
Let's go.

38:09.280 --> 38:11.282
*

38:36.707 --> 38:38.709
(grunts, pants)

38:55.859 --> 38:58.295
(grunting)

39:06.703 --> 39:08.739
Just a... a little further.
Little further.

39:11.375 --> 39:13.177
-(bones crack)
-(screams)

39:13.210 --> 39:14.178
Come on!
Come on, a little further.

39:14.211 --> 39:16.613
A little further, come on!

39:16.647 --> 39:17.681
(bones crack)

39:27.391 --> 39:30.127
Ed. Ed, are you okay?

39:30.161 --> 39:32.696
He's unconscious but stable.

39:32.729 --> 39:34.331
You'll have to get him
back to your ship,

39:34.365 --> 39:35.966
but he'll be all right.

39:35.999 --> 39:38.235
Are you gonna be all right?

39:38.269 --> 39:40.003
Alara took care of it.

39:40.037 --> 39:42.406
She always does.

40:02.025 --> 40:04.161
ILDIS:
Alara? Are you okay?

40:04.195 --> 40:06.597
-I'm fine. How's Ed?
-A few broken bones,

40:06.630 --> 40:08.031
-but he'll make it.
-Good.

40:08.065 --> 40:10.334
Alara, you...
we would all have been...

40:10.367 --> 40:12.569
You don't have to say it.

40:12.603 --> 40:15.038
Dad, it's my job.

40:15.072 --> 40:18.175
It's what I've been trying
to tell you for years.

40:18.209 --> 40:20.211
They would have killed us.

40:20.244 --> 40:22.613
All of us.

40:22.646 --> 40:24.548
Probably.

40:26.783 --> 40:29.253
I don't know you.

40:29.286 --> 40:32.022
I never even tried to know you.

40:32.055 --> 40:36.593
I wanted you to know me, Dad.

40:36.627 --> 40:37.961
All I ever wanted

40:37.994 --> 40:41.098
was for you to be proud of me.

40:43.167 --> 40:45.469
I am so proud.

40:45.502 --> 40:48.004
So very proud
that you are my daughter.

40:51.275 --> 40:54.245
And I'm so sorry
that you got me for a father.

40:57.514 --> 40:59.750
(crying)

41:22.005 --> 41:24.007
*

41:27.010 --> 41:29.746
We've managed
to create a finite area

41:29.780 --> 41:32.683
of stabilized synthetic graviton
particles in the simulator.

41:32.716 --> 41:34.685
And you're sure this will work?

41:34.718 --> 41:37.288
Two hours a week of high-gravity
treatments, and you'll be able

41:37.321 --> 41:39.190
to maintain your strength
aboard the Orville.

41:39.223 --> 41:41.525
Sounds so simple.

41:41.558 --> 41:43.994
Not entirely.
The gravity is amplified,

41:44.027 --> 41:46.463
even from what you're used to
on Xelayah.

41:46.497 --> 41:49.166
The treatments will be painful
at first, very painful.

41:49.200 --> 41:51.168
But you'll be able
to keep your posting.

41:51.202 --> 41:54.871
You're our chief of security
as long as you want to be.

42:07.484 --> 42:09.486
-(door chimes)
-Come in.

42:11.655 --> 42:13.624
Hey.

42:13.657 --> 42:15.025
How you feeling?

42:15.058 --> 42:16.727
Not bad.

42:16.760 --> 42:17.994
Claire said you're scheduled

42:18.028 --> 42:19.463
for your first treatment
this afternoon.

42:19.496 --> 42:22.065
That's actually what I came
to talk to you about.

42:22.098 --> 42:26.470
Uh, Captain...

42:26.503 --> 42:28.004
What's wrong?

42:28.038 --> 42:31.074
I've decided not to do
the treatments.

42:31.107 --> 42:33.844
Claire said they were painful,
but I didn't think that...

42:33.877 --> 42:37.548
No, it's not that. It's...

42:37.581 --> 42:40.484
Sir, I joined the fleet

42:40.517 --> 42:43.254
because I never
really had a family.

42:43.287 --> 42:46.490
And I wanted
to belong to something

42:46.523 --> 42:48.692
larger than myself.

42:50.261 --> 42:51.762
Captain, the Orville

42:51.795 --> 42:53.664
has been so much more

42:53.697 --> 42:56.600
than I ever could've wished for.

42:56.633 --> 43:00.237
It was warm.
It was welcoming.

43:00.271 --> 43:01.738
I was needed.

43:03.440 --> 43:06.843
You were my family.

43:06.877 --> 43:11.282
You and this entire crew, but...

43:11.315 --> 43:15.386
I found something on Xelayah.

43:15.419 --> 43:19.523
Something I'd only ever seen
from afar.

43:19.556 --> 43:22.726
I always thought it was just for
other people, but not for me.

43:22.759 --> 43:26.930
And now I have a chance
to experience it for myself.

43:28.999 --> 43:31.067
I've already missed out
on so much time.

43:31.101 --> 43:34.771
I... I don't want
to miss out anymore.

43:34.805 --> 43:37.007
You're going back.

43:38.141 --> 43:40.777
I need to be with my family.

43:40.811 --> 43:44.247
That's two goodbyes
so close together.

43:46.683 --> 43:49.753
I won't forget this place.

43:49.786 --> 43:51.555
I promise.

43:51.588 --> 43:54.758
We won't forget you.

43:56.092 --> 43:59.162
And if you ever decide...

43:59.195 --> 44:01.465
that you miss that little chair
on the bridge...

44:01.498 --> 44:02.833
(chuckles)

44:02.866 --> 44:04.868
...it'll be there for you.

44:08.305 --> 44:10.807
This is for you.
(laughs softly)

44:13.977 --> 44:17.013
It's been a pleasure
serving with you, Lieutenant.

44:17.047 --> 44:19.983
Likewise, Captain.

44:29.025 --> 44:31.027

44:48.645 --> 44:50.647

45:18.709 --> 45:20.711

45:47.270 --> 45:49.272
*

46:19.302 --> 46:21.304
*

46:36.186 --> 46:38.188
(shuttle door closes)

46:50.467 --> 46:53.169
*

47:20.897 --> 47:22.966
*

48:22.593 --> 48:24.561
