00:04.235 --> 00:06.217
<i>(Frankie) High school</i>
<i>is chock full of land mines.</i>

00:06.305 --> 00:08.002
<i>But Axl had made it through</i>
<i>his four years</i>

00:08.131 --> 00:09.403
<i>pretty much unscathed...</i>

00:09.532 --> 00:11.580

00:11.697 --> 00:13.016

(School bell rings)

00:13.112 --> 00:14.378
- Foster.
(Girl) - Here.

00:14.517 --> 00:15.462
Randall?

00:15.580 --> 00:16.376
(Boy) Here.

00:16.486 --> 00:17.778
- Heck.
- Here.

00:18.326 --> 00:20.521
- Heck.
- Still here.

00:20.880 --> 00:23.389
Uh, no, it says I have
two Hecks in this class.

00:23.498 --> 00:24.605
Well, that must be a typo,

00:24.715 --> 00:26.084
'cause there's no other Heck...

00:26.369 --> 00:27.317
except...

00:27.485 --> 00:29.205
Sorry I'm late.

00:29.883 --> 00:31.376
(Gasps) Axl!

00:31.549 --> 00:33.370
I didn't know we were
in the same class.

00:33.518 --> 00:35.001
Oh, my God. (Laughs)

00:35.136 --> 00:36.632
This is my brother.

00:36.793 --> 00:38.097
(Laughter)

00:38.357 --> 00:39.253
(Door opens)
(Axl) And another thing--

00:39.363 --> 00:40.477
why are you always raising your hand...
(Door closes)

00:40.584 --> 00:41.815
and asking questions
like a dork?

00:41.955 --> 00:42.752
Stare at the clock,

00:42.867 --> 00:44.470
and wait for the bell to ring
like a normal person.

00:44.583 --> 00:46.862
Excuse me
if I like to participate.

00:46.963 --> 00:47.881
What's going on?

00:47.969 --> 00:49.248
So I was sitting
in my life skills class,

00:49.344 --> 00:50.668
minding my own business,

00:50.793 --> 00:52.592
when hurricane Sue rolls in,

00:52.712 --> 00:54.595
blowing geek
and raining nerd everywhere!

00:54.706 --> 00:55.981
What are you even doing
in that class?

00:56.084 --> 00:57.502
It's for freshmen
and sophomores only,

00:57.625 --> 00:59.652
not loser seniors who missed it

00:59.763 --> 01:01.575
'cause they were
taking math two times.

01:01.682 --> 01:04.583
Ha! It was English I took twice.
Who's the idiot now?

01:05.525 --> 01:07.829
Make her drop out.
It's not just me.

01:07.948 --> 01:10.062
There's 30 innocent lives
in there she's ruining.

01:10.182 --> 01:12.926
Okay, clearly, you two shouldn't
be in the same room... ever.

01:13.084 --> 01:14.780
Can't one of you switch
to a different period

01:14.905 --> 01:16.305
or school or something?

01:16.426 --> 01:17.601
Look, I'd say
try getting along,

01:17.764 --> 01:19.266
but I'd never
keep a straight face.

01:19.369 --> 01:21.076
Why don't you pretend
you don't know each other?

01:21.209 --> 01:23.138
That was my plan, too,
but Sue kept talking to me.

01:23.255 --> 01:24.528
You pushed my desk
into the hallway!

01:24.642 --> 01:25.434
You left me no choice!

01:25.544 --> 01:27.196
Enough. The whole reason
we send you to school

01:27.306 --> 01:28.278
is so we don't have to
deal with you

01:28.394 --> 01:29.899
for seven hours a day.
Now go do your homework.

01:30.002 --> 01:31.043
(Axl) I don't have any.
(Sue laughs)

01:31.138 --> 01:31.891
Yes, we do.
(Gasps)

01:31.991 --> 01:34.254
See?! That's exactly
what I'm talking about!

01:34.390 --> 01:36.424
Look, like it or not,
life is full of stuff,

01:36.547 --> 01:38.004
and you just have to
roll with it.

01:38.154 --> 01:40.370
(Clatter and crash in distance)

01:47.945 --> 01:49.341
What was that
we're supposed to do again?

01:49.448 --> 01:50.685
When the stuff happens?

01:51.484 --> 01:52.491
(Sighs)

01:53.398 --> 01:55.090
<i>Meanwhile,</i>
<i>Axl wasn't the only one</i>

01:55.248 --> 01:57.614
<i>with an unwanted guest</i>
<i>in his class.</i>

02:03.535 --> 02:05.519

02:25.862 --> 02:27.302
(Door squeaks)

02:27.595 --> 02:28.892
Have you been spying on me?

02:29.012 --> 02:30.450
<i>Whoa.</i> Whoa.

02:30.602 --> 02:32.049
(Door closes)
Stop the interrogation.

02:32.178 --> 02:35.021
I'll spill.
Here, have-- have a seat.

02:38.316 --> 02:39.658
Hi.

02:40.159 --> 02:42.606
I'm Dr. Fulton,
the school therapist.

02:42.750 --> 02:43.807
Your social skills teacher

02:43.922 --> 02:46.999
gave me the heads up
about this guy named Brick.

02:47.152 --> 02:48.601
Look, if this is gonna
turn into a whole thing,

02:48.711 --> 02:51.135
I'm gonna need cookies.
The nurse gives you cookies.

02:51.262 --> 02:52.841
Can I be straight
with you, Brick?

02:53.191 --> 02:55.590
You don't seem to have
many friends.

02:55.684 --> 02:56.853
And I get that.

02:57.014 --> 02:59.532
You know, I didn't have
a girlfriend until I was 30.

02:59.661 --> 03:02.032
(Chuckles) But this is no time
to bring up Shelly.

03:02.332 --> 03:04.716
- Let me cut to the chase.
- Please.

03:04.851 --> 03:06.747
In all my observing,
I don't think I once saw you

03:06.862 --> 03:09.357
having a conversation
with another student.

03:09.782 --> 03:10.866
Well, I don't know.

03:10.991 --> 03:13.521
I'm pretty sure I said,
"take one and pass it back."

03:13.670 --> 03:14.643
You know, making a connection

03:14.758 --> 03:16.823
is not as tough
as you might think.

03:16.968 --> 03:18.874
Have you watched
the kids in the hall?

03:19.053 --> 03:22.183
They have this whole unspoken
language of communication

03:22.300 --> 03:24.170
that helps them to link up.

03:24.329 --> 03:25.833
Sometimes it can be
something as small

03:25.991 --> 03:28.185
as just, like, a tiny head nod.

03:28.380 --> 03:29.339
They also think it's fine

03:29.467 --> 03:31.058
to punch each other
in the privates.

03:31.188 --> 03:34.504
(Laughs) Well, that is
always a classic.

03:34.667 --> 03:36.114
But the good news is,

03:36.283 --> 03:38.646
I think I can teach you
some strategies

03:38.759 --> 03:42.288
that might help you
to score some amigos.

03:42.416 --> 03:44.826
- Are you game for that?
- Do I have a choice?

03:44.937 --> 03:46.324
No, you do not.

03:46.517 --> 03:47.915
I think the best way to proceed

03:48.034 --> 03:50.164
would be
to schedule our sessions

03:50.294 --> 03:52.277
during your library time.

03:52.394 --> 03:53.286
What?

03:53.407 --> 03:54.771
No, not my library time.

03:54.879 --> 03:56.938
You can't do that.
I know how this works.

03:57.080 --> 03:59.775
You can't do anything
without my parents' permission.

03:59.912 --> 04:01.466
Oh, but, Brick...

04:01.983 --> 04:03.716
I already have it.

04:05.312 --> 04:06.288
(Dog barking in distance)

04:06.371 --> 04:08.122
Hello, mother.
Hello, father.

04:08.282 --> 04:11.181
So now I need a therapist?
Am I really that weird?

04:11.303 --> 04:12.915
Look, you're no weirder
than you've ever been,

04:13.034 --> 04:15.298
it's just that suddenly,
the school seems to care.

04:15.524 --> 04:17.913
Don't you think that's something
we should talk about?

04:18.076 --> 04:19.706
What happened to
"you're growing up, Brick,"

04:19.846 --> 04:22.242
"we should include you
in the conversations, Brick"?

04:22.376 --> 04:23.628
It's good for you,
and it's free.

04:23.756 --> 04:25.058
You're doing it.

04:28.235 --> 04:29.470
It is free, right?

04:29.597 --> 04:31.159
Oh, yeah.
Checked twice.

04:31.280 --> 04:32.302
Good, 'cause I finally
got through

04:32.411 --> 04:34.262
to the insurance company.
Apparently they're backed up,

04:34.402 --> 04:35.544
and it's gonna be
at least a week

04:35.652 --> 04:36.928
before they can
process our claim.

04:37.047 --> 04:39.606
What? A week with no windshield?
(Door closes)

04:39.682 --> 04:41.115
This is not
convertible weather, Mike.

04:41.224 --> 04:42.580
What are we supposed to do?

04:43.247 --> 04:44.797
(Wind blowing)

04:46.051 --> 04:48.065
For your first
life skills project,

04:48.183 --> 04:49.987
you will be assigned a career.

04:50.107 --> 04:52.295
In addition
to a 10-page written paper,

04:52.431 --> 04:53.740
you will create a resume

04:53.892 --> 04:56.205
and have visual aids
for your presentation.

04:56.338 --> 04:57.844
You will have two weeks
to research

04:57.983 --> 04:59.962
and present your findings
to the class.

05:00.111 --> 05:01.927
Remember,
my young professionals,

05:02.059 --> 05:04.482
<i>the</i> most important
life skill of all--

05:04.643 --> 05:06.370
have fun!

05:06.543 --> 05:08.427
We're gonna be doing
this assignment in pairs,

05:08.547 --> 05:11.144
so why doesn't everyone
go ahead? Find a partner.

05:12.057 --> 05:14.807
(Indistinct conversations)

05:19.851 --> 05:21.910
(Axl) And they said
it couldn't be done.

05:22.082 --> 05:23.866
Mega-shoelace.
(Camera shutter clicks)

05:23.994 --> 05:24.832
So, is there anyone

05:24.955 --> 05:26.585
who still doesn't
have a partner?

05:27.342 --> 05:29.794
Perfect.
You two are now a team.

05:32.506 --> 05:33.996
No!

05:34.374 --> 05:35.633
(Thud)

05:42.799 --> 05:43.845
Look, Axl,

05:44.013 --> 05:46.618
it's no picnic for me
being your partner, either.

05:46.762 --> 05:47.875
You don't think
I would have rather

05:47.987 --> 05:49.160
been paired up
with Spencer Hegman

05:49.288 --> 05:51.328
and his notorious
attention to detail?

05:51.460 --> 05:53.724
I would.
But I got you instead.

05:53.863 --> 05:56.305
So let's just try
to make the best of it.

05:57.139 --> 05:58.930
So do you have any ideas
for the paper?

05:59.041 --> 06:00.027
(Mouth full) - No.
- Resume?

06:00.143 --> 06:01.130
Negatory.

06:01.265 --> 06:02.485
Food demonstration?

06:02.563 --> 06:03.653
Bleh.

06:03.761 --> 06:04.728
Oh.

06:04.832 --> 06:06.789
Axl, stop screwing around!

06:06.885 --> 06:09.374
Vijal Bawa and Connie Wong
have already started.

06:09.504 --> 06:11.066
- I know this for a fact!
- Oh, my God.

06:11.194 --> 06:13.079
School Sue is even more annoying
than home Sue.

06:13.212 --> 06:14.711
Would you just relax?
We got two weeks.

06:14.813 --> 06:17.051
Come find me in 13 1/2 days.
(Bag rustles)

06:17.157 --> 06:18.482
N-- Axl,

06:18.627 --> 06:20.264
you cannot wait
till the night before!

06:20.377 --> 06:21.884
Sure I can. That's what
they want us to do.

06:22.771 --> 06:23.682
<i>What?</i>

06:23.809 --> 06:24.938
(Turns on TV) It's true, Sue.

06:25.039 --> 06:26.009
Teachers are lazy.

06:26.126 --> 06:27.615
They know it only takes
a day to do a project,

06:27.728 --> 06:28.921
but if they gave us
assignments every day,

06:29.052 --> 06:30.356
they'd have to
grade 'em every day.

06:30.507 --> 06:31.731
They don't want it,
we don't want it.

06:31.836 --> 06:33.468
It's an unspoken agreement.
Who are you to mess

06:33.578 --> 06:34.986
with the American
educational system?

06:35.074 --> 06:36.266
We're not number one
in the world for nothing.

06:36.348 --> 06:37.442
Suck it, China!

06:37.550 --> 06:39.407
That's why they gotta
make all our stuff for us.

06:39.555 --> 06:42.400
(Groans and squeals loudly)

06:43.192 --> 06:44.482
Okay, Brick.

06:44.824 --> 06:48.565
Here's a little trick
I like to call eye contact.

06:48.678 --> 06:50.258
Try using those peepers

06:50.377 --> 06:54.624
and really opening yourself up
to the other students, hmm?

06:55.388 --> 06:57.603
(Indistinct conversations)

07:02.267 --> 07:04.604
Another thought--
you like books.

07:04.845 --> 07:07.046
Why don't you find
some fellow book buddies

07:07.177 --> 07:09.298
and try to connect with them?

07:09.886 --> 07:11.798
So, what kind of story
you looking for?

07:11.913 --> 07:14.143
Man versus man?
Man versus nature?

07:14.315 --> 07:17.216
How about
a nice epistolary novel?

07:18.285 --> 07:19.243
(Sighs)

07:22.453 --> 07:24.518
One surefire way
of making friends?

07:24.619 --> 07:25.976
Finding something
the other kids are into

07:26.156 --> 07:28.543
and gettin' on board
with that program.

07:30.289 --> 07:32.360
Hey, Brick. Uh...

07:33.437 --> 07:36.488
I thought today's assignment
was playing tag.

07:36.608 --> 07:37.590
I am.

07:37.725 --> 07:40.956
I've achieved the highest
level of tag. I'm it.

07:47.465 --> 07:50.090
You know, I went on
kickinitteenstyle.com

07:50.238 --> 07:52.313
and took the "rate your
assignment partner" quiz,

07:52.456 --> 07:56.130
and you are a "severe
collaboration limitation."

07:56.252 --> 07:59.055
With no due respect, I disagree.
(Paper wad thumps)

07:59.185 --> 08:00.590
I thought you might
say something like that,

08:00.717 --> 08:02.473
so I also ranked you
on the sibling scale,

08:02.606 --> 08:04.526
and guess what?

08:04.686 --> 08:06.369
You're a "bummer brother."

08:06.517 --> 08:09.044
So... yeah.

08:09.171 --> 08:11.559
(Scoffs) Whatever.
This whole thing is lame.

08:11.941 --> 08:12.539
(Thumps)

08:12.648 --> 08:13.899
Except kitchen floor hoops,

08:14.013 --> 08:16.011
which I just invented,
and is totally awesome.

08:16.122 --> 08:19.403
I know you fancy yourself
some kind of rebel, Axl,

08:19.546 --> 08:22.316
but sometimes in life, you just
have to follow the rules.

08:22.492 --> 08:25.737
<i>I</i> put on sunscreen
an hour before going outside.

08:25.875 --> 08:29.327
I wait till the bus comes to
a complete stop before standing.

08:29.457 --> 08:32.390
You don't think I would love
to fill up on bread? I would.

08:32.528 --> 08:34.265
But that's not
how the world works.

08:34.388 --> 08:35.524
The rule of this project

08:35.652 --> 08:37.267
is that you and I
take the allotted two weeks

08:37.393 --> 08:39.184
and do it <i>together.</i>

08:39.332 --> 08:41.460
And that's just what
we're gonna do, mister.

08:41.596 --> 08:43.924
'Cause a "D" might fly
in Ax Land,

08:44.066 --> 08:46.401
but it doesn't work
in Sue City.

08:46.532 --> 08:49.568
And not the one in Iowa.
The one right here.

08:52.591 --> 08:54.014
(Sighs)

08:54.152 --> 08:56.590
<i>So Sue was making about</i>
<i>as much progress with Axl</i>

08:56.727 --> 08:58.678
<i>as we were</i>
<i>with the insurance company.</i>

08:58.811 --> 09:01.382
<i>But I was not gonna drive</i>
<i>around without a windshield.</i>

09:01.653 --> 09:04.174
<i>I just needed to be</i>
<i>a little creative.</i>

09:04.354 --> 09:05.839
(Wind whistling)

09:05.955 --> 09:08.426
(Squeaks)

09:09.641 --> 09:12.084
(Squeaks, snaps)

09:12.551 --> 09:13.891
(Wind howling)

09:14.133 --> 09:15.752
(Ripping)

09:25.303 --> 09:27.050
So I <i>don't</i> want to be it?

09:27.183 --> 09:28.088
Right.

09:28.204 --> 09:29.546
But doesn't <i>it</i>
have all the power?

09:29.691 --> 09:31.565
If you're it,
you have to chase people.

09:31.724 --> 09:35.081
Who says? If I'm it,
don't I make all the decisions?

09:35.257 --> 09:36.684
(Whispers) It.

09:37.281 --> 09:39.300
(Slurps) Okay. I'm calling it on boredom.
(Sets down can)

09:39.404 --> 09:40.667
- Night.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

09:40.801 --> 09:42.843
Not so fast. It's your turn
to do the dishes.

09:42.966 --> 09:44.882
<i>Oh.</i> Right.

09:45.003 --> 09:47.499
Oh, wish I could, but I can't.

09:47.620 --> 09:48.718
Got a really big project
tomorrow,

09:48.840 --> 09:50.341
so I'm just gonna go watch
a few hours of TV

09:50.467 --> 09:52.855
to get the brain fired up
and then get started.

09:52.969 --> 09:54.269
Don't bother.
It's already done

09:54.380 --> 09:56.280
and tied up and stuffed
in a bag by the door.

09:56.449 --> 09:59.292
As should <i>you</i> be
for your lackluster effort.

09:59.450 --> 10:02.440
Wait. Wasn't this project
both of yours?

10:02.565 --> 10:03.362
- Yes.
- Yes.

10:03.523 --> 10:06.110
But I guess she went ahead
and did it without me.

10:06.260 --> 10:07.410
Can you believe this?

10:07.534 --> 10:08.710
I was so looking forward
to learning,

10:08.837 --> 10:10.667
and she robbed me of that.
She's so selfish.

10:10.796 --> 10:12.610
Guess that frees you up
to do the dishes, then.

10:12.723 --> 10:14.852
Unless...
Tag. You're it. (Laughs)

10:14.951 --> 10:16.368
See, Brick?
That's how it works.

10:16.493 --> 10:18.146
- Wait, Axl, we still need to decide...
- I'm not gonna do the dishes for you.

10:18.283 --> 10:19.541
...who's saying what when!

10:19.672 --> 10:21.205
(Brick) You can't
pawn stuff off on me...

10:21.337 --> 10:23.102
Brr!
I cannot get warm.

10:23.227 --> 10:24.586
Seriously, I've been
in the house for hours.

10:24.682 --> 10:26.850
I'm still freezing.
Feel my face.

10:26.954 --> 10:28.839
H-hey!
Get your cold nose off me.

10:28.963 --> 10:30.691
(Sighs) It's not my fault.

10:30.809 --> 10:32.601
People need windshields.

10:32.959 --> 10:35.630
Well, you may get one
soon enough.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.525
Here's the check
from the insurance company.

10:37.692 --> 10:38.662
(Click)

10:38.796 --> 10:39.902
Hang on.

10:40.004 --> 10:41.520
They're denying our claim?

10:41.618 --> 10:43.027
<i>What?</i> Wh--

10:43.208 --> 10:45.012
let me see that.

10:46.877 --> 10:49.954
Where's the money?
There's no check in here.

10:50.141 --> 10:51.836
Not putting a check
in the envelope is our trick.

10:51.961 --> 10:53.336
I don't want it done to me.

10:53.452 --> 10:56.256
We're denied 'cause of
code 426E.

10:56.379 --> 10:58.066
What's 426E?
(Dog barking in distance)

10:58.253 --> 10:59.623
"Act of God."

10:59.758 --> 11:01.359
We <i>have</i> act of God.

11:01.508 --> 11:03.169
We have
the comprehensive policy.

11:03.297 --> 11:05.088
Remember? You thought
it was too expensive,

11:05.236 --> 11:06.957
and I said the only
other safety net we have

11:07.074 --> 11:09.219
is the Hoosier Lotto,
so we ended up getting it.

11:09.358 --> 11:10.179
You know what?

11:10.296 --> 11:12.273
I know those receipts
are around here somewhere.

11:12.433 --> 11:14.295
'Cause we paid those premiums.

11:14.415 --> 11:16.680
I remember, because
we were a little late,

11:16.835 --> 11:19.108
and the guy was really nice
about taking it.

11:19.213 --> 11:20.706
Yeah, they're real nice
about taking your money,

11:20.822 --> 11:22.499
it's giving it back
they have a problem with.

11:22.613 --> 11:23.848
Well, we are going down there,

11:23.952 --> 11:25.221
and we're bringing our car

11:25.340 --> 11:27.338
so that they can see what they've done to us.
(Papers rustling)

11:27.440 --> 11:29.480
I am not taking this lying down.
(Thud)

11:32.288 --> 11:33.936
Had a thought, Brick.

11:34.418 --> 11:36.236
I've been sending you
out to talk to other kids

11:36.366 --> 11:38.642
with nothing in your toolbox.

11:38.799 --> 11:40.187
And that was my bad.

11:40.302 --> 11:41.905
So I've taken the liberty
of scripting up

11:42.024 --> 11:43.806
a little practice conversation

11:43.961 --> 11:47.310
that I think might just
get the old ball rolling, huh?

11:49.100 --> 11:50.327
"Hey."

11:50.696 --> 11:51.984
"What's up, dude?"

11:52.348 --> 11:54.514
"Oh, you know.
Just chillin'."

11:54.635 --> 11:56.140
"That's cool."

11:56.739 --> 11:58.876
"Hey, man, I like your style.

11:59.025 --> 12:00.970
You seem like a cool guy."

12:01.121 --> 12:02.582
"You seem cool, too.

12:02.744 --> 12:06.495
And hey. I totally appreciate
the eye contact, buddy."

12:06.639 --> 12:08.942
"Thanks. Maybe we could
hang out sometime.

12:09.089 --> 12:10.892
What do you say, bro?"

12:11.088 --> 12:12.709
I really don't think
I would say "bro."

12:12.873 --> 12:14.551
Oh. Oh, okay.
Well, that's no big.

12:14.693 --> 12:17.632
We'll just, uh, change that...

12:18.129 --> 12:20.753
to "ace," hmm?

12:20.886 --> 12:22.402
Can I ask you a question?

12:22.670 --> 12:25.005
Why do I need to make friends
with kids, anyway?

12:25.124 --> 12:26.601
I mean-- I mean,
what's the point?

12:26.757 --> 12:28.414
They're not interested
in what I have to say,

12:28.538 --> 12:30.871
and I'm certainly not interested
in their conversations.

12:31.021 --> 12:32.532
You've seen them in the halls.

12:32.649 --> 12:34.146
They shove, they kick.

12:34.288 --> 12:36.856
They take delight
in screaming for no reason.

12:37.042 --> 12:39.594
If somebody farts,
it's the highlight of their day.

12:39.737 --> 12:41.052
They chase each other around

12:41.189 --> 12:43.484
so that way, they may in turn
be chased themselves.

12:43.630 --> 12:45.231
I still don't understand
that one.

12:45.367 --> 12:48.491
Well, y-yeah, Brick,
but... everyone needs friends.

12:48.625 --> 12:49.703
Well, I do have friends--

12:49.826 --> 12:51.644
the librarian,
the crossing guard,

12:51.787 --> 12:52.882
you.

12:53.070 --> 12:54.054
Oh.

12:54.550 --> 12:56.190
Oh, well, thank you, Brick.

12:56.362 --> 12:59.620
That-- oh. (Chuckles)
That gets me right here.

12:59.752 --> 13:02.171
But I really mean
friends your own age.

13:02.295 --> 13:03.714
But if you look at
the entirety of my life,

13:03.839 --> 13:05.312
won't I actually be
spending more time

13:05.439 --> 13:07.241
with adults than kids, anyway?

13:07.420 --> 13:08.193
Sure, but--

13:08.329 --> 13:09.339
Think about it.

13:09.490 --> 13:10.913
If the whole point of this
is to prepare me

13:11.048 --> 13:13.634
to be able to make connections
with adults later in my life,

13:13.792 --> 13:16.964
aren't I actually ahead of
the other kids in that regard?

13:17.097 --> 13:18.640
Uh, I-in <i>theory...</i>

13:18.772 --> 13:20.850
So... why is it so important
for me

13:20.969 --> 13:22.585
to make friends with kids?

13:26.390 --> 13:28.139
Mr. Flurry! Rocking the gray...

13:28.263 --> 13:29.301
(Slaps) as usual.

13:29.439 --> 13:32.005
Thanks, Axl.
Great game the other day. (Snaps)

13:32.361 --> 13:33.414
(Chuckles)

13:33.517 --> 13:34.918
Axl! Where have you been?

13:35.056 --> 13:36.397
Have you even gone over
the note cards?

13:36.517 --> 13:38.810
We are presenting
first today. <i>First!</i>

13:38.937 --> 13:39.879
Calm it down, school Sue.

13:39.993 --> 13:40.945
I'll practice
during the announcements.

13:41.060 --> 13:42.102
It's the Axl method.

13:42.209 --> 13:44.013
No, that is
the failing-the-class method.

13:44.142 --> 13:46.216
Just stick to the note cards
and follow my lead.

13:46.337 --> 13:48.751
No improvising.
Let me get you your apron.

13:50.980 --> 13:52.076
Oh, no.

13:52.224 --> 13:53.282
Oh, no!

13:53.594 --> 13:55.716
- Oh, <i>no!</i>
- What?

13:55.912 --> 13:57.179
I grabbed the wrong bag.

13:57.303 --> 14:00.429
This is your stupid stuff!
Oh! (Board thuds)

14:00.558 --> 14:01.772
Oh, my God.

14:02.297 --> 14:03.789
Oh, my God. We're dead!

14:03.949 --> 14:06.182
Everything was in there--
the paper, the resume,

14:06.292 --> 14:08.437
the note cards, the menus,
the aprons.

14:08.560 --> 14:10.800
(Gasps) The note reminding me
to get the food for the class

14:10.899 --> 14:11.914
out of the fridge.

14:12.063 --> 14:13.502
I gave you one job to do...

14:13.664 --> 14:16.529
You gave me <i>every job!</i>

14:16.944 --> 14:18.655
(School bell rings) Okay.

14:18.846 --> 14:20.076
Okay.

14:20.812 --> 14:21.864
That's it.

14:22.426 --> 14:23.846
We're gonna get an "F."

14:23.975 --> 14:25.426
I'm the kid who gets F's now.

14:25.546 --> 14:26.659
That's who I am.

14:26.812 --> 14:28.634
Maybe I'll just get a tattoo.

14:28.755 --> 14:30.256
That's it?
You're just gonna give up?

14:30.371 --> 14:31.394
Oh, my God.
What is your problem?

14:31.514 --> 14:32.804
It's not even due yet.
We got, like, five minutes.

14:32.908 --> 14:33.938
We can do this.

14:35.184 --> 14:36.604
Hey. Steve.

14:36.743 --> 14:38.022
(Laughs) What's up?

14:38.165 --> 14:39.279
What up, Ax?

14:39.408 --> 14:40.774
Not much. Hey, remember
that time at the lake

14:40.885 --> 14:42.544
I introduced you
to Lindsay Sullivan?

14:42.736 --> 14:43.546
How's that going?

14:43.661 --> 14:44.874
Dude, she's my girlfriend now.

14:44.973 --> 14:45.959
I owe you one.

14:46.091 --> 14:48.432
Yeah. You do.
And don't forget that.

14:48.769 --> 14:50.413
Okay. (Chuckles nervously)

14:51.332 --> 14:52.209
(Door opens)

14:52.886 --> 14:54.225
(School bell rings)

14:56.718 --> 14:57.857
(Woman) All right.

14:58.001 --> 15:00.547
(Keypad clicking)
"Hey, Michelle. Need a favor."

15:00.729 --> 15:03.364
Okay. I'm looking forward

15:03.479 --> 15:04.971
to hearing
everyone's presentations.

15:05.095 --> 15:07.568
We don't have a lot of time,
so let's get started.

15:07.682 --> 15:09.812
Let's see-- Sue Heck
signed up to go first?

15:09.972 --> 15:11.164
<i>(Tone sounds over PA, click)</i>

15:11.293 --> 15:12.379
<i>(Girl) Hi. This is Michelle</i>

15:12.495 --> 15:13.622
<i>with your morning</i>
<i>announcements.</i>

15:13.742 --> 15:16.503
<i>But first, will Axl Heck</i>
<i>please report to the office?</i>

15:16.678 --> 15:18.781
Well, Axl, we had
a presentation ordered,

15:18.894 --> 15:21.253
but if you can find someone
who'd be willing...

15:21.402 --> 15:23.004
Uh, right here.
I'll switch.

15:23.094 --> 15:25.103
Okay. Steve,
you and your partner go first,

15:25.215 --> 15:28.874
Axl, you can go to the office,
but make it quick.

15:31.234 --> 15:32.496
<i>The class</i>
<i>was called life skills,</i>

15:32.619 --> 15:34.437
<i>and Axl sure put his</i>
<i>to good use.</i>

15:34.540 --> 15:36.686
Hey, Erica.
Look at you making posters.

15:36.780 --> 15:38.554
- You're crazy good.
- Thanks.

15:38.674 --> 15:39.687
Know what I could use?

15:39.828 --> 15:40.918
One of these, about...
(Exhales)

15:41.045 --> 15:43.476
Alan Hung!
What's up, buddy?

15:43.615 --> 15:45.211
You can, like, hack into
people's computers, right?

15:45.325 --> 15:46.898
'Cause there's this paper
on my sister's computer,

15:47.016 --> 15:49.095
the password
is "I heart trying."

15:49.210 --> 15:50.815
(Boy) So, you see,
there are many aspects

15:50.937 --> 15:53.314
to a dry cleaning business--
tagging, treatment,

15:53.435 --> 15:55.673
pressing, tailoring,
collection, and...

15:55.781 --> 15:58.209
Beth. That's business class,
isn't it?

15:58.327 --> 15:59.518
Yeah. It's so boring.

15:59.645 --> 16:01.601
I bet. Know what could
be fun for you?

16:02.857 --> 16:04.115
Hey, Bernice.

16:04.243 --> 16:05.786
Nice work
on the tater tots yesterday.

16:05.927 --> 16:07.089
Can I help you with this?

16:07.453 --> 16:08.565
(Bag rustles) I need a favor.

16:12.050 --> 16:14.963
(Playing scales)

16:15.118 --> 16:20.261
Okay, it's time
for our final presentation.

16:22.732 --> 16:24.365
Nope. Nope. No, no,
no, no, no, no.

16:24.488 --> 16:25.366
Where you going,
Mr. Heck?

16:25.465 --> 16:26.243
What's all this?

16:26.376 --> 16:27.550
Hey, Principal Cameron.

16:27.688 --> 16:29.293
I'm actually on my way
to my life skills presentation,

16:29.419 --> 16:31.245
and I'm sorta late, so...

16:31.350 --> 16:33.676
I see. Well, do you
<i>sorta</i> have a hall pass?

16:33.782 --> 16:36.491
'Cause if not, you're gonna
<i>sorta</i> need to roll that cart

16:36.634 --> 16:38.553
all the way down to detention.

16:38.672 --> 16:39.886
Uh...

16:40.147 --> 16:41.242
Oh.

16:41.750 --> 16:42.884
Here it is.

16:43.015 --> 16:44.203
Must have been
in my back pocket.

16:44.315 --> 16:46.189
You know, you might want
to turn those into badges,

16:46.332 --> 16:49.251
so you can clip them
right here, or here.

16:50.235 --> 16:51.341
All right. Get to class.

16:51.462 --> 16:54.573
Uh...
I like the badge idea.

16:54.852 --> 16:56.236
You're sharper than you look.

16:56.841 --> 16:58.221
Yes.

16:58.680 --> 17:01.008
Sue, where's Axl?

17:01.296 --> 17:02.630
(Door opens)

17:03.018 --> 17:04.364
Ladies and gentlemen,

17:04.484 --> 17:06.012
The Ax is back.

17:06.191 --> 17:07.461
(Laughs)

17:08.094 --> 17:09.146
Hey!

17:10.877 --> 17:14.171
Oh, Sue.
Dropped her resume. Silly.

17:14.290 --> 17:15.557
That would have been a mess.

17:15.778 --> 17:17.027
All right, Sue.

17:17.964 --> 17:19.671
Okay. And do you
have your report?

17:19.780 --> 17:21.221
Of course.

17:21.526 --> 17:23.190
And it's ten pages?

17:23.323 --> 17:25.213
Actually 11.
Hope that's okay.

17:25.336 --> 17:26.631
(Laughs)

17:36.013 --> 17:38.703
Hello. This is Sue,
my name is Axl,

17:38.834 --> 17:40.831
and we will be
your chefs today.

17:42.006 --> 17:43.879
(Gasps) (Students) Ooh!

17:44.021 --> 17:45.193
Mmm.

17:45.338 --> 17:49.168
(Playing Italian music)

17:51.153 --> 17:54.192
Imagine yourselves
in an Italian restaurant.

17:54.330 --> 17:56.907
How do you think something
like this comes together?

17:57.115 --> 17:58.759
I don't <i>know!</i>

17:58.896 --> 18:01.202
Thank you, Sue, for expressing
what we're all thinking.

18:01.355 --> 18:03.032
♪

18:09.035 --> 18:11.091
So we have paid our premiums,

18:11.286 --> 18:13.956
on time.
We are organized people.

18:14.087 --> 18:16.600
Just bear with me.
I have it right here.

18:17.327 --> 18:19.767
Whoops-- that's a warranty
for the popcorn popper.

18:19.886 --> 18:21.404
(Laughs) And this is the record

18:21.532 --> 18:23.556
for Brick's
chicken pox vaccine.

18:23.715 --> 18:24.924
Sorry.

18:25.195 --> 18:26.912
Takeout menu.

18:27.103 --> 18:28.930
Oh. Another
chicken pox vaccine.

18:30.409 --> 18:32.082
This one's Brick, too.

18:32.249 --> 18:35.359
Oh, so Sue's the one that hasn't
been vaccinated. Huh.

18:35.569 --> 18:37.613
Actually, I just pulled up
your file.

18:37.766 --> 18:41.441
Yep. You are paid up
and covered for acts of God.

18:41.561 --> 18:44.953
See? Thank you. So do we get
the check from you,

18:45.079 --> 18:48.383
or, uh, maybe from that other
cubby over there by the coffee?

18:48.507 --> 18:50.322
And are those doughnuts
for everybody?

18:50.457 --> 18:51.675
Hold on now.

18:51.798 --> 18:53.686
Looks like the incident
of January 10th

18:53.815 --> 18:56.653
is <i>not</i> covered
under acts of God.

18:56.840 --> 18:57.769
(Both) What?

18:57.877 --> 18:59.828
A tree branch
fell down on our car.

18:59.939 --> 19:02.059
How is that not an act of God?

19:02.174 --> 19:03.940
Tree-- made by God,

19:04.071 --> 19:05.712
blown down by the wind--
more God.

19:05.809 --> 19:07.231
That's actually
double act of God.

19:07.347 --> 19:08.656
We should be
getting two checks.

19:08.764 --> 19:10.565
Well, according
to the inspection,

19:10.717 --> 19:12.688
your tree
wasn't trimmed properly.

19:13.018 --> 19:16.763
Did you ever have it looked at
by a certified arborist?

19:16.999 --> 19:18.068
Oh, I'm sorry.

19:18.188 --> 19:20.061
We're in between
arborists right now.

19:20.181 --> 19:21.640
What are you talking about?

19:21.756 --> 19:22.690
Here's the deal--

19:22.812 --> 19:24.159
unless you trimmed
your tree branches

19:24.272 --> 19:26.817
to the acceptable length,
it's negligence.

19:26.930 --> 19:28.913
And how are we supposed to know
what the acceptable length is?

19:29.172 --> 19:30.608
I'm just gonna guess here,

19:30.707 --> 19:32.968
but I'm thinking
it's the length of a branch

19:33.129 --> 19:34.661
that when the wind blows,

19:34.811 --> 19:36.765
doesn't fall down on your car.

19:36.911 --> 19:37.967
(Sighs)

19:38.111 --> 19:41.931
Look, we know an act of God
when we see one, okay?

19:42.044 --> 19:43.798
We've had rain
from our ceiling.

19:43.914 --> 19:45.595
We've had floods
from our dishwasher.

19:45.719 --> 19:48.674
We've had bedbugs,
tornadoes, black mold,

19:48.809 --> 19:51.322
red ants, a frog infestation!

19:51.436 --> 19:52.242
Yeah. Frogs.

19:52.381 --> 19:53.885
It's the end of days
at our house.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.336
I am not kidding you!

19:55.467 --> 19:56.913
Look, in other people's cases,

19:57.051 --> 19:58.633
God works in mysterious ways,

19:58.767 --> 19:59.869
but not in ours.

19:59.980 --> 20:01.640
With us,
he's pretty straightforward.

20:01.774 --> 20:04.039
And we are not people
who ask for a lot.

20:04.156 --> 20:07.730
But we <i>are</i> people who demand
what is ours and what is right,

20:07.851 --> 20:09.235
and if you
cannot get with that,

20:09.364 --> 20:11.203
then maybe you need
to get your supervisor,

20:11.336 --> 20:12.822
because I don't think
that you want

20:12.943 --> 20:17.364
good, paying customers like us
driving away angry.

20:17.839 --> 20:20.298
(Wind whistling) I'm so angry.

20:21.123 --> 20:23.372
Brick, you asked me why

20:23.501 --> 20:25.483
you have to be friends
with other kids, all right?

20:25.607 --> 20:27.888
And I ran it through
the old think tank,

20:28.010 --> 20:30.196
and here's what I came up with.

20:31.693 --> 20:33.549
I have no idea.

20:34.132 --> 20:35.416
But I'm gonna be
applying for a job

20:35.552 --> 20:37.256
cutting keys
down at the hardware store

20:37.391 --> 20:38.940
if you don't show
some signs of improvement,

20:39.077 --> 20:41.854
so I'm just asking you
as a friend... (Sighs)

20:41.973 --> 20:43.001
Can you help me out?

20:43.116 --> 20:45.577
Can you-- can--
can you do me a solid?

20:46.399 --> 20:49.553
Can we move our sessions
so I don't miss library time,

20:49.682 --> 20:51.547
but I do miss gym?

20:52.057 --> 20:53.235
Done.

20:54.420 --> 20:56.356
<i>So how do we get life skills?</i>

20:56.935 --> 20:58.609
<i>Sometimes you learn 'em.</i>

21:03.675 --> 21:05.962
<i>Sometimes you're born</i>
<i>with 'em...</i>

21:08.422 --> 21:10.595
<i>and sometimes</i>
<i>you just have to rely</i>

21:10.725 --> 21:12.134
<i>on an act of God.</i>

21:12.283 --> 21:13.089
Hi.

21:13.212 --> 21:15.619
We heard you were having
a little trouble with your car

21:15.766 --> 21:18.365
and hope you'll feel free
to use the church van

21:18.518 --> 21:19.909
for the next few weeks.

21:20.025 --> 21:20.771
Aw.

21:20.874 --> 21:23.859
But we will need you
to drive the saintly seniors

21:23.982 --> 21:25.899
to the beauty shop
on Wednesday.

21:26.294 --> 21:27.743
(Keys jingle)

21:29.165 --> 21:31.320
Hey. It's got a windshield.
