00:19.584 --> 00:21.626
(P Orchestral Intro)

01:41.417 --> 01:43.834
(Horse approaches)

02:38.626 --> 02:40.042
(Chokes)

02:47.209 --> 02:49.167
(Chuckles)

04:00.334 --> 04:01.709
(Woman screams)

04:02.751 --> 04:04.501
Help!

04:05.626 --> 04:08.251
Help! Police!

04:08.376 --> 04:10.042
Help!

04:25.209 --> 04:27.042
(Blows whistle)

04:51.126 --> 04:53.334
(P Whistling cheerful tune)

04:59.001 --> 05:01.626
Don't see no one
taking that house yet awhile.

05:01.751 --> 05:03.376
Nor me.

06:06.751 --> 06:08.959
Blimey, it works.

06:16.751 --> 06:19.876
Nancy, hurry. Hurry!
They're coming along now.

06:20.001 --> 06:23.417
I saw the cab down the square.
Go on. Give me the duster.

06:54.001 --> 06:55.876
- Good afternoon, Nancy.
- Good afternoon, ma'am.

06:56.001 --> 06:58.501
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Good afternoon.

07:04.334 --> 07:07.126
(D Organ plays)

07:16.417 --> 07:18.876
What a beautiful voice he has,
hasn't he?

07:21.167 --> 07:23.292
Those are the Mallens
from Number 12.

07:23.417 --> 07:27.417
- Yes. I thought we might call on them.
- Not in London. It wouldn't be correct.

07:27.542 --> 07:29.709
- Oh, but...
- My dear, I said no.

07:31.584 --> 07:33.667
Only two maids.

07:46.751 --> 07:50.959
- I hear he's a foreigner.
- But he looks most respectable.

07:53.126 --> 07:55.001
Come on, Cobb.

08:15.667 --> 08:17.542
All right behind?

08:34.376 --> 08:37.708
- Seen Mr Rough, John?
- Over there, with Hannibal.

08:41.208 --> 08:44.626
Excuse me, sir, the message from the vet
about the mare. He says...

08:45.459 --> 08:47.334
You all right, sir?

08:48.626 --> 08:51.667
- I've seen a ghost, Cobb.
- What, here, sir?

08:51.792 --> 08:54.626
The ghost of a man out of my past.

08:54.751 --> 08:56.876
Oh, you mean when you were
in the police force, sir.

08:57.001 --> 09:00.417
Most of my ghosts are criminals,
but this one wasn't.

09:00.542 --> 09:03.334
I know the story
of the house he lives in.

09:03.459 --> 09:06.501
I was on a case there once,
when I was a young peeler.

09:07.042 --> 09:08.459
Louis Bauer!

09:08.584 --> 09:12.042
The nephew of old Alice Barlow
that was murdered 20 years ago.

09:12.167 --> 09:13.792
Louis Bauer.

09:13.917 --> 09:16.834
A foreigner he was,
and very cut up, I remember.

09:16.959 --> 09:20.792
Funny he should come back
to 12 Pimlico Square after all these years.

09:20.917 --> 09:23.042
12 Pimlico Square
is Mr Mallen's house, sir.

09:23.167 --> 09:26.376
Nonsense. Louis Bauer.
Right face, right house.

09:26.501 --> 09:29.001
- No, you're wrong, sir.
- Impossible.

09:29.126 --> 09:31.126
What do you know about it, anyway?

09:31.251 --> 09:34.459
It's the parlour maid, sir.
You see, she's a friend of mine.

09:34.584 --> 09:36.209
The family's name is Mallen.

09:36.334 --> 09:38.459
- And they live at Number 12?
- Yes, sir.

09:39.001 --> 09:40.751
Leastways, part of it.

09:40.876 --> 09:43.834
Nancy says they don't use
the top two storeys.

09:43.959 --> 09:46.209
A bit queer, Nancy says.

09:46.334 --> 09:48.251
It means less dusting for her, though.

09:49.042 --> 09:51.251
Mrs Mallen's queer, too.

09:51.376 --> 09:54.667
Queer, is she? Mm...
In what way?

09:55.251 --> 09:59.709
Well, she's sort of odd in her mind.
She does strange things.

09:59.834 --> 10:04.334
Nancy says Mr Mallen gets very upset.
He goes out every night.

10:04.459 --> 10:09.667
- It's a very queer place.
- Yes, it does sound queer.

10:11.792 --> 10:13.667
I want you to see
as much of her as you can.

10:13.792 --> 10:15.876
- What, the mare, sir?
- No, no, your Nancy.

10:16.001 --> 10:18.667
Oh, she's not mine.
I'm only one of the pebbles on the beach.

10:18.792 --> 10:23.209
Well, you play up to her.
I want to know everything that goes on.

10:23.334 --> 10:27.917
I believe I'm going to be
very interested in Number 12.

10:38.917 --> 10:41.209
A dirty evening for a stroll, sir.

10:41.334 --> 10:43.417
There's a lot of dirty things in London.

10:43.542 --> 10:45.501
(Bell rings)

11:04.334 --> 11:08.084
- Bella, what are you doing?
- Nothing, Paul. Don't wake up.

11:08.209 --> 11:11.542
- What are you doing, Bella?
- I thought I heard the muffin man.

11:11.667 --> 11:14.417
Then why didn't you ring for Nancy
to find out?

11:14.542 --> 11:18.626
- It would mean two journeys for her...
- Ring for Nancy, Bella.

11:27.126 --> 11:28.334
(Bell rings)

11:28.459 --> 11:30.376
What do you suppose
the servants are for?

11:31.126 --> 11:33.751
To serve us, I suppose, dear.

11:35.417 --> 11:37.584
Nancy, I rang. The muffin man.

11:37.709 --> 11:40.834
Oh, I thought you rang for tea, ma'am.
I was just bringing it up.

11:40.959 --> 11:43.209
Then it's too late for muffins.

11:43.334 --> 11:45.667
Not at all, my dear, not at all.

11:45.792 --> 11:48.917
Nancy, spread the cloth,
then lay the tea things,

11:49.042 --> 11:51.376
go down and get the muffins,
cook the muffins,

11:51.501 --> 11:53.959
and bring up the muffins.

11:54.084 --> 11:56.417
You see, my dear, it's all quite simple.

11:58.126 --> 12:00.459
- Light the gas, Nancy.
- Yes, sir.

12:04.876 --> 12:08.084
You're looking very impudent
and pretty tonight, Nancy.

12:09.709 --> 12:12.459
- More broken hearts?
- I don't know, I'm sure, sir.

12:12.584 --> 12:14.542
Where do you get
the colour for your cheeks, Nancy?

12:14.667 --> 12:16.709
Could you not give the recipe
to Mrs Mallen?

12:16.834 --> 12:19.792
Oh no, sir. I'm natural.

12:19.917 --> 12:22.167
(Paul laughs)

12:22.292 --> 12:26.292
- Will that be all you're wanting, sir?
- Yes, Nancy. That'll do for the present.

12:32.501 --> 12:36.167
Paul, as though I'd do anything to my face,
or ask for her assistance if I did.

12:36.292 --> 12:38.959
Oh, Bella,
I was only trifling with her.

12:39.626 --> 12:42.001
It's so humiliating for me.

12:42.126 --> 12:45.542
- That girl laughs at me enough, as it is.
- Nonsense, Bella.

12:45.667 --> 12:48.917
You know perfectly well
how you imagine things.

12:50.001 --> 12:52.167
Don't say that.

12:52.292 --> 12:54.626
I have been better
the last two weeks, haven't I?

12:54.751 --> 12:57.167
- What do you mean?
- You know very well what I mean.

12:57.292 --> 12:59.501
I've been trying so hard,

12:59.626 --> 13:03.001
and I have been better
because you've been kind to me.

13:07.292 --> 13:10.834
I'll be perfectly all right, if only
you'll be patient and gentle with me.

13:10.959 --> 13:14.126
Of course, my dear, of course.

13:23.542 --> 13:26.251
- Shall I stay in this evening?
- Would you?

13:26.376 --> 13:27.876
Mm-hmm.

13:28.001 --> 13:30.292
- What shall we do?
- Tea first.

13:30.417 --> 13:32.209
And then I'll play for you.

13:33.334 --> 13:36.667
We'll have an evening
just like we used to.

13:39.376 --> 13:41.751
(D Plays waltz)

14:01.376 --> 14:03.501
(P Paul sings along)

14:13.834 --> 14:15.501
Oh, Bella!

14:16.501 --> 14:18.167
What is it?

14:19.084 --> 14:21.542
I've just noticed something.

14:21.667 --> 14:25.626
If you put it right while I'm not looking,
I will say no more about it.

14:25.751 --> 14:29.126
What's the matter?
I don't understand.

14:32.751 --> 14:35.167
Paul, don't turn your back on me.

14:35.292 --> 14:37.709
Look on the wall behind you.

14:42.959 --> 14:45.334
The picture, it's gone again.

14:45.459 --> 14:48.126
Yes. Where have you hidden it
this time?

14:48.251 --> 14:50.667
I didn't take it. Why should I take it?
It's no use to me.

14:50.792 --> 14:54.001
Why should you take other things?
Pencils, knives...

14:54.126 --> 14:55.417
Paul, don't.

14:55.959 --> 14:58.792
Bella, where's the picture?

15:00.084 --> 15:02.834
I didn't take it, I swear I didn't.

15:04.792 --> 15:07.334
Come. Get the picture.

15:11.126 --> 15:14.251
I'd know if I touched it.
I'd remember.

15:14.376 --> 15:16.417
I've been better lately.

15:16.542 --> 15:19.709
You've missed nothing for days.

15:19.834 --> 15:24.459
Two weeks, I've been well.
I've had no headaches, no dreams.

15:24.584 --> 15:26.876
Why should I take the...?

15:54.459 --> 15:56.459
So you did know where it was.

15:57.751 --> 15:59.834
(Bella) I promise you, I didn't.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.667
I supposed it was here
because it was found here twice before.

16:02.792 --> 16:06.001
- Why do you persist in lying to me, Bella?
- It's the truth.

16:06.126 --> 16:08.667
Bella, if you're not lying,
there's only one alternative.

16:08.792 --> 16:11.126
- You're losing your wits!
- (She drops painting)

16:13.917 --> 16:16.751
You promised
you'd never say that to me again.

16:16.876 --> 16:19.501
No control even of your hands.

16:21.501 --> 16:24.584
- You'd better go to your room.
- No, no, not my room.

16:24.709 --> 16:26.792
I can't bear to be alone.

16:27.626 --> 16:29.501
Oh, God, help me.

16:29.626 --> 16:31.584
God help you, indeed.

17:10.584 --> 17:13.001
I'm going to appeal to you, Paul.

17:14.626 --> 17:18.041
Please...
Please don't be angry with me.

17:19.084 --> 17:20.959
I've never lied knowingly to you.

17:21.084 --> 17:23.626
If I took the picture,
or your ring, or your pencil, I...

17:24.834 --> 17:26.791
I didn't know.

17:28.001 --> 17:30.709
You must bear with me, Paul.

17:36.126 --> 17:39.501
I don't know how much longer
I can keep my patience.

17:41.209 --> 17:42.876
($Obs)

18:28.292 --> 18:29.959
- Eavesdropping, Nancy?
- No, sir.

18:30.084 --> 18:32.167
I didn't hear anything.
I was just carrying the muffins...

18:32.292 --> 18:35.251
Your mistress is
a very unusual woman.

18:35.376 --> 18:37.209
Quite strange, you know.

18:37.959 --> 18:42.001
You mustn't let things
you hear and see in this house upset you.

18:44.251 --> 18:48.042
You are a young girl.
Inexperienced.

18:50.084 --> 18:52.751
You are inexperienced, aren't you?

18:54.751 --> 18:57.251
It depends how you mean, sir.

18:57.376 --> 18:59.042
(Paul chuckles)

19:02.334 --> 19:04.376
Thank you, Nancy.

19:12.917 --> 19:15.376
(P Whistles cheerful tune)

22:34.334 --> 22:37.542
(Bella) Tillie, don't.
You know he doesn't like it.

22:41.334 --> 22:45.792
Isn't it a lovely day, Paul?
Look at the sunshine out in the square.

22:45.917 --> 22:49.167
- Where's my letter?
- What letter?

22:49.292 --> 22:53.126
I haven't had one for such a long time.
I do hope it's from Cousin Vincent.

22:54.334 --> 22:57.376
- It isn't here.
- Why should there be a letter for you?

22:57.501 --> 22:59.209
Nancy told me there was one.

22:59.334 --> 23:01.292
- Oh, Bella.
- Oh, she did. She did, Paul.

23:01.417 --> 23:05.542
You've been through them yourself, dear.
You see they're all addressed to me.

23:05.667 --> 23:08.251
I had so hoped...

23:08.376 --> 23:10.792
- There must be a letter, Paul.
- (Clock chimes)

23:10.917 --> 23:12.001
Nine o'clock.

23:12.126 --> 23:13.792
Good morning, ma'am.
Good morning, sir.

23:13.917 --> 23:15.292
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Elizabeth.

23:15.417 --> 23:17.542
The dog, Bella.

23:25.417 --> 23:28.542
(Bella) I'm sorry, Tillie.
It won't be for long.

23:40.042 --> 23:43.376
I will read from the 127th Psalm.

23:44.876 --> 23:47.209
"Except the Lord build the house..."

23:47.334 --> 23:49.334
(Whimpers)

23:51.876 --> 23:54.959
"...but they speak with their enemies
in the gate."

23:56.542 --> 23:58.542
Let us pray.

24:02.917 --> 24:05.167
(Mr Rough)
Pimlico Square, I was after.

24:05.292 --> 24:09.292
Number 14 is the only empty house
in the square, I'm afraid.

24:09.417 --> 24:12.376
We are the sole agents.
(Coughs)

24:12.501 --> 24:14.917
- My pipe worrying you?
- Not at all.

24:15.042 --> 24:17.709
Faces south.
A little alley runs along the back.

24:17.834 --> 24:20.292
Nothing to block out the light.

24:21.876 --> 24:24.834
But we'll have some difficulty,
I'm afraid, Mr Rough.

24:24.959 --> 24:26.167
Why's that?

24:26.292 --> 24:30.542
The remainder of the lease of No.14
is in the hands of Mr Mallen of No.12.

24:30.667 --> 24:33.334
And he's already refused
three good offers.

24:33.459 --> 24:36.042
Mr Mallen of Number 12?
Why won't he let?

24:36.167 --> 24:38.751
Do you know,
I have often wondered.

24:38.876 --> 24:40.834
A queer profession, mine,
Mr Rough.

24:40.959 --> 24:44.001
So near to so many people's lives,

24:44.126 --> 24:47.751
and yet...
always on the doorstep, as it were.

24:47.876 --> 24:49.542
Yes. Yes, indeed.

24:49.667 --> 24:52.501
A fascinating study,
human nature, Mr Rough.

24:52.626 --> 24:54.459
Fascinating.

24:55.584 --> 24:58.834
You don't think there's much chance
of that house being on the market?

24:58.959 --> 25:02.042
If you want to make an offer,
do so, by all means.

25:02.167 --> 25:05.792
I sometimes wonder
if it's the noise he's afraid of.

25:05.917 --> 25:09.251
The wife's a delicate woman.
Just had a breakdown, I understand.

25:09.376 --> 25:11.126
A charming creature.

25:11.251 --> 25:15.542
I've seen her often walking in the gardens
of the square with her dog.

25:15.667 --> 25:18.751
- Gardens? Sounds very pleasant.
- They're charming, they are.

25:48.042 --> 25:49.292
(Child) I'm sorry.

25:49.417 --> 25:53.292
Oh... I wonder
how that happened, eh?

25:54.751 --> 25:56.626
Oh... Oh, dear!

25:57.542 --> 26:00.209
- Oh, my dear lady!
- I'm all right, thank you.

26:00.334 --> 26:02.167
- Where's my little dog?
- Little savages.

26:02.292 --> 26:04.626
- I hope you're not hurt, ma'am?
- No, not a bit.

26:04.751 --> 26:07.334
- You come and sit down over here.
- Oh... No, I'm all right.

26:07.459 --> 26:11.084
Oh, you can't possibly tell if you're hurt
until you've had time to think it over.

26:11.209 --> 26:14.501
It doesn't matter much when
you've soft bones like those little rascals.

26:14.626 --> 26:17.751
- I should complain to their nurses.
- It wasn't their fault. It was...

26:17.876 --> 26:21.126
- Oh, thank you. That is kind of you.
- Fond of children, I see.

26:21.251 --> 26:24.042
- Got any of your own?
- No.

26:25.667 --> 26:28.667
- I must go.
- You haven't counted all your bones yet.

26:28.792 --> 26:32.042
Don't worry about me.
I'm old enough to be your father.

26:32.167 --> 26:33.417
They're not what they used to be.

26:33.542 --> 26:35.001
- Who aren't?
- Children.

26:35.126 --> 26:37.834
I'd be ashamed
if I couldn't bowl a better hoop than that.

26:37.959 --> 26:40.751
I never bothered about hoops.
I was brought up in the country.

26:40.876 --> 26:43.584
- So was I. Whereabouts?
- Devonshire.

26:43.709 --> 26:45.834
Devonshire? What part?

26:45.959 --> 26:50.167
- I lived with some cousins near Exmouth.
- I know Exmouth very well.

26:50.292 --> 26:53.251
- I wonder if I've met them.
- Their name was Ullswater.

26:55.084 --> 26:58.251
Don't go yet.
I was just getting interested.

26:58.376 --> 26:59.751
(Children squabbling)

26:59.876 --> 27:02.459
Stop it! Stop it, you rude little boys!
It's disgraceful!

27:02.584 --> 27:03.626
How dare they!

27:03.751 --> 27:07.042
Hmm... Poor little devils.
I'd like to give them a taste of Devonshire.

27:07.167 --> 27:11.667
Yes, a grass bank to roll down
and some nice, clean mud.

27:11.792 --> 27:13.876
Well, thank you for being so kind.

27:14.001 --> 27:15.709
- Toy shop!
- I beg your pardon?

27:15.834 --> 27:18.376
Something for those little objects
to play with.

27:21.376 --> 27:22.917
There is a toy shop across the road.

27:23.042 --> 27:25.334
Oh, what a lovely idea.
They do look so miserable.

27:25.459 --> 27:28.667
Well, you'll have to come along, too.
I mean, that's the whole idea.

27:28.792 --> 27:31.667
Must have a woman about
where brats are concerned, you know?

27:31.792 --> 27:35.001
I mean, they'd run a mile
if I were to so much as call to them.

27:35.126 --> 27:37.792
- I'd love to see them enjoy themselves...
- What's to stop you?

27:37.917 --> 27:40.167
My husband is out
and he won't be back till teatime.

27:40.292 --> 27:42.126
Then you'll be in time
to have it with him.

27:42.251 --> 27:44.501
I don't want to be silly,
but I don't know you.

27:44.626 --> 27:48.917
Oh, this is charity, ma'am.
That blows convention out of the window.

27:49.042 --> 27:50.251
Hey!

27:50.376 --> 27:52.501
I mean you children
out there in the street.

27:52.626 --> 27:54.667
Come along. Don't be afraid.

27:54.792 --> 27:56.917
I've got something for you.

28:03.334 --> 28:05.292
Would you like some toys
to play with?

28:05.417 --> 28:07.459
It is such a shame
you can't go into the square.

28:07.584 --> 28:10.001
- This gentleman thought...
- There's a toy shop over there.

28:10.126 --> 28:13.584
- Tops, if you like, or hoops.
- Do let's go across, shall we?

28:35.459 --> 28:37.542
Good afternoon.

28:37.667 --> 28:39.417
We've come to the wrong shop.

28:39.542 --> 28:42.084
- Buns and ice cream are what they want.
- Do you think we should?

28:42.209 --> 28:45.542
Nonsense! Make them all sick.
Do them a world of good.

28:45.667 --> 28:47.709
You know what you want, don't you?
Come on in.

28:51.626 --> 28:53.876
Here we are. Help yourselves.

28:55.167 --> 28:58.667
- Blimey, look at them lovely tarts!
- There's plenty more.

28:58.792 --> 29:02.251
Anything you like, in reason.
That's right.

29:17.001 --> 29:21.251
- And what exactly can we do for you?
- Knock his block off.

29:21.917 --> 29:25.042
You, who cannot control yourself
in your own home,

29:25.167 --> 29:27.542
to risk such a thing
with a complete stranger!

29:27.667 --> 29:31.667
- It was the children, Paul.
- A horde of noisy street urchins.

29:31.792 --> 29:34.959
When you know the only hope for you
is rest and quiet.

29:36.209 --> 29:38.251
Put the dog down.
You're not listening to me.

29:38.376 --> 29:40.626
I am listening.
What are you going to do?

29:40.751 --> 29:43.292
I've told you before.
I can't stand the dog in the drawing room.

29:43.417 --> 29:48.459
- I'm very fond of her, Paul.
- It's not natural, the fuss you make over it.

29:48.584 --> 29:51.751
Sometimes I wonder
if you even want to be like other people.

29:52.751 --> 29:54.751
Why did you ever marry me, Paul?

29:55.501 --> 29:58.167
When I married you, Bella,
you were a normal woman.

29:58.292 --> 29:59.917
Or so I thought.

30:02.001 --> 30:05.834
It's only since we came to this house
that I've changed.

30:06.667 --> 30:08.876
I never wanted to come here.

30:10.251 --> 30:13.709
Yet it was my money
that made it possible for you to buy it.

30:15.167 --> 30:17.542
Is that why you married me, Paul?

30:17.667 --> 30:19.501
You have changed, Bella.

30:19.626 --> 30:23.126
What's made me change?
What's made you change, Paul?

30:24.167 --> 30:26.542
Because you have,
in the way you treat me.

30:27.709 --> 30:30.709
I believe
it's ever since that day when...

30:30.834 --> 30:35.084
I found that old envelope
addressed to Louis Bauer.

30:36.626 --> 30:40.334
That was the first time that
you were angry with me like this.

30:41.959 --> 30:45.209
Bella, I told you
I had forgotten that incident.

30:47.292 --> 30:51.042
My only anxiety has always been
to get you well.

30:53.001 --> 30:55.251
I must get away from here.

30:55.376 --> 30:58.709
I'll never be well
till I get away from this house.

30:58.834 --> 31:01.459
(Puppeteer imitating
Punch & Judy voices)

31:02.792 --> 31:04.834
Come outside, Judy. Come along.

31:04.959 --> 31:07.376
Hello, Judy. How do you do?

31:08.459 --> 31:10.126
Guess what?

31:12.001 --> 31:14.001
Paul, I could.

31:14.126 --> 31:16.126
My cousins, the Ullswaters.

31:17.292 --> 31:20.376
It would be lovely
to smell Devonshire again.

31:20.501 --> 31:25.042
Your cousin, Mr Vincent Ullswater,
had the effrontery to oppose our marriage.

31:25.167 --> 31:27.501
Oh, but that's over and done with.
Vincent won't mind now.

31:27.626 --> 31:31.459
But I mind. I have no desire
to reopen our acquaintance.

31:31.584 --> 31:34.042
Besides, I don't care
to drag strangers into our troubles.

31:34.167 --> 31:37.126
They're not strangers,
they're my own people. They're all I have.

31:37.251 --> 31:40.501
I want to see them, I...
I will see them.

31:40.626 --> 31:43.792
If you see anyone, it will be a doctor.

31:43.917 --> 31:47.292
No. No, not a doctor, Paul, I...

31:47.417 --> 31:50.001
I'm well. I'm better.

31:50.751 --> 31:53.251
Please leave me alone, Paul.

31:53.376 --> 31:55.834
(Punch & Judy voices)

31:55.959 --> 31:59.417
- Whatever should I do?
- Be quiet.

31:59.542 --> 32:02.584
- Oh, my poor head!
- That was very cruel.

32:03.792 --> 32:08.126
But I don't see how I can take
the responsibility for you any longer.

32:15.251 --> 32:17.501
Oh, Bella.

32:19.751 --> 32:21.584
Don't cry.

32:23.292 --> 32:25.834
You'll spoil your looks,

32:25.959 --> 32:29.501
and I wanted you
to look very beautiful tonight.

32:31.501 --> 32:35.001
Have you any objections
to being seen out with your husband?

32:36.001 --> 32:38.042
Why?
Are you going to take me out?

32:38.167 --> 32:40.959
There's a charity concert tonight
at Winterbourne House.

32:41.084 --> 32:43.167
I could get tickets.
I know Lady Winterbourne.

32:43.292 --> 32:46.209
- A concert, and you'd take me?
- I should enjoy it, my dear...

32:46.334 --> 32:47.876
Oh, how wonderful!

32:48.001 --> 32:49.751
...provided that you promise
to control yourself,

32:49.876 --> 32:51.709
to behave as you know
I'd wish my wife to behave.

32:51.834 --> 32:56.334
- I promise. What shall I wear?
- Whatever you look prettiest in, my dear.

32:57.084 --> 33:01.417
Bella, wear the cameo brooch
I gave you when we got engaged.

33:01.542 --> 33:03.167
I will.

33:20.626 --> 33:22.376
My brooch, please, Nancy.

33:22.501 --> 33:24.792
- The big cameo.
- Yes, ma'am.

33:29.792 --> 33:33.667
- It's not here, ma'am.
- It must be. Look underneath.

33:35.584 --> 33:38.167
Of course it's here. Let me look.

33:41.501 --> 33:43.084
Perhaps I left it in another dress.

33:49.876 --> 33:51.501
Bella!

33:51.626 --> 33:53.334
- Time to start, Bella.
- Coming, Paul.

33:53.459 --> 33:55.417
- Nancy, my cloak.
- Which one, ma'am?

33:55.542 --> 33:58.876
- Which one do you think?
- Couldn't say, I'm sure, ma'am.

33:59.001 --> 34:00.417
Oh.

34:01.917 --> 34:03.584
This will do.

34:18.917 --> 34:21.583
What a very lovely person!

34:25.501 --> 34:27.876
Charming. But not my brooch?

34:29.292 --> 34:31.417
I would've worn it.
You know how fond I am of it...

34:31.542 --> 34:34.626
only it didn't go with this dress.

34:34.751 --> 34:37.417
I wouldn't presume
to criticise your taste.

34:37.542 --> 34:40.583
But your hair, is it quite right?
Come, I'll hold that.

34:48.958 --> 34:50.958
It's a quarter to eight, Bella.

34:52.792 --> 34:57.001
I think I'm making it worse.
My hand's quite shaky with excitement.

34:57.751 --> 34:59.167
(Bell rings)

34:59.292 --> 35:01.292
(Paul) Ah, there's the cab.

35:06.959 --> 35:09.626
I think I'm going
to enjoy myself tonight.

35:10.667 --> 35:12.876
(indistinct chattering)

35:19.917 --> 35:24.459
- (Man) Mr John and Mr Hogan.
- How do you do?

35:24.584 --> 35:27.042
Mr and Mrs Blair.

35:29.167 --> 35:31.667
Prince Hanawa and Mr Ryan.

35:33.459 --> 35:35.667
Mr and Mrs Mallen.

35:36.709 --> 35:38.084
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

35:38.209 --> 35:40.042
- May I introduce my wife?
- How do you do?

35:40.167 --> 35:42.084
- How do you do?
- A very good cause, isn't it?

35:42.209 --> 35:44.292
(Man) Lady Frinton, Miss Frinton.

35:44.417 --> 35:46.084
(Woman) Splendid cause,
don't you think?

35:46.209 --> 35:48.459
(Man) Mr Rollings, Miss Rollings.

35:49.126 --> 35:50.667
Charming. Quite a complexion.

36:04.292 --> 36:06.209
You are the most beautiful of all.

36:06.334 --> 36:07.709
(Applause)

36:18.667 --> 36:21.751
- I hope the stool is right.
- Thank you.

37:31.834 --> 37:33.501
Bella...

37:34.167 --> 37:36.084
Bella, my watch.

37:38.751 --> 37:40.709
My watch is gone.

37:41.667 --> 37:43.792
You must have forgotten it.

37:47.459 --> 37:49.584
Don't worry about it now.

37:53.834 --> 37:56.292
I don't know anything about it, Paul.

37:56.417 --> 37:59.459
But it was in my pocket
when we left the house.

38:01.417 --> 38:03.459
Paul, don't look at me like that.

38:05.459 --> 38:07.751
Let me have a look at your bag.

38:22.501 --> 38:24.251
(Gasps)

38:25.042 --> 38:26.667
I didn't put it there. I swear I didn't.

38:26.792 --> 38:28.834
Will you be quiet, please?

38:32.334 --> 38:34.459
Control yourself, Bella.

38:34.584 --> 38:36.417
Please spare me a scene in public.

38:36.542 --> 38:40.209
- Paul... a scene, no...
- Shh. Come.

38:50.417 --> 38:53.501
- (Sobbing)
- Lady Winterbourne, I do apologise.

38:53.626 --> 38:56.376
- My wife had an attack.
- Let me send for a doctor.

38:56.501 --> 38:58.917
No, thank you.
It's nothing unusual, unfortunately.

38:59.042 --> 39:01.001
Come along, darling.
Come along.

39:29.751 --> 39:31.792
Paul, speak to me.

39:32.792 --> 39:35.334
Don't sit there silent. I can't stand it.

39:37.251 --> 39:39.709
Hit me, hurt me, do anything, but...

39:41.084 --> 39:43.751
...for pity's sake, speak to me.

39:55.209 --> 39:56.626
Oh, dear.

40:00.751 --> 40:02.417
(Driver) Thank you, sir.

40:11.167 --> 40:13.001
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

40:28.376 --> 40:31.459
Paul, how can you
torture me like this?

40:31.584 --> 40:33.709
And have you not tortured me?

40:33.834 --> 40:38.667
You make my life a misery at home,
and now you shame me in public.

40:38.792 --> 40:42.001
At least let's keep your stealing,
pickpocketing and lying to ourselves.

40:42.126 --> 40:44.042
I haven't lied to you.
I didn't take your watch.

40:44.167 --> 40:46.167
- What about the brooch?
- Brooch?

40:46.292 --> 40:49.626
The one I asked you to wear tonight.
The one that didn't go with your dress.

40:49.751 --> 40:53.126
- It's upstairs in my room.
- More lies.

40:53.251 --> 40:55.792
It is. It must be.
It's only mislaid, Paul.

40:55.917 --> 40:58.042
You've hidden it away
in one of your mad dreams.

40:58.167 --> 41:01.084
I have not. If it's gone,
someone else has taken it.

41:01.209 --> 41:02.334
Someone else?

41:04.126 --> 41:06.709
We'll see about someone else.

41:09.501 --> 41:13.709
Elizabeth, Nancy, come up
to the drawing room at once, please!

41:18.626 --> 41:22.126
Paul, please don't question the servants
in front of me.

41:22.251 --> 41:24.459
Oh, dear, dear.
What's happened now?

41:24.584 --> 41:26.501
Mistress been playing him up again,
I suppose.

41:26.626 --> 41:30.167
There you are, Tillie.
Go into your basket. There you are.

41:30.292 --> 41:33.876
- Stop titivating yourself. Come on.
- Right.

41:34.001 --> 41:37.501
Paul, please
don't have that girl up here.

41:37.626 --> 41:40.167
At least let me look again first.

41:46.959 --> 41:48.917
(indistinct chattering)

41:57.626 --> 42:00.667
(Elizabeth) Don't you giggle so much.
Behave yourself.

42:04.292 --> 42:06.792
It may have fallen
behind the dressing table.

42:06.917 --> 42:09.417
Let's talk this over between ourselves.

42:09.542 --> 42:13.292
Please!
Please don't let the servants know.

42:13.417 --> 42:15.584
- (Knocking on door)
- Come in!

42:17.417 --> 42:20.001
Shut the door, please, Elizabeth.
Come into the room.

42:24.709 --> 42:27.251
You know the cameo brooch
your mistress often wears?

42:27.376 --> 42:29.334
- Yes, sir.
- And you, Nancy?

42:29.459 --> 42:31.459
- Yes, sir.
- It is missing.

42:32.709 --> 42:34.251
Do you know anything about it?

42:35.042 --> 42:39.292
I want you to think carefully
before you answer, Elizabeth.

42:44.417 --> 42:47.084
No, sir, I don't.

42:47.209 --> 42:51.001
You will please kiss the Bible
in token of your truthfulness.

43:01.126 --> 43:02.917
Thank you.

43:07.001 --> 43:09.584
And you, Nancy,
have you ever touched the brooch?

43:09.709 --> 43:11.542
No, sir, of course I haven't.

43:20.167 --> 43:22.084
Thank you. You may go.

43:33.001 --> 43:35.626
Be careful what you do.
Don't commit sacrilege as well.

43:35.751 --> 43:37.876
This is no sacrilege.

43:39.126 --> 43:42.084
I swear by Almighty God
that I neither took your watch,

43:42.209 --> 43:44.334
nor hid away the brooch.

43:44.459 --> 43:48.167
Then you are mad,
you unhappy creature.

43:48.292 --> 43:51.917
And you'll get worse until you die,
raving in an asylum!

44:11.751 --> 44:13.834
And where the devil
are you going, Nancy?

44:13.959 --> 44:17.126
I came to see if there were any letters
for the post, sir.

44:17.251 --> 44:21.042
Are you expecting to meet somebody
on your way to the post?

44:21.167 --> 44:25.251
- Only a gentleman friend, sir.
- So I supposed.

44:25.376 --> 44:28.667
Well, are there any letters, sir?

44:29.667 --> 44:31.417
Come in here for a moment, will you?

44:37.751 --> 44:40.209
Let me have a look at your hair.

44:40.334 --> 44:42.167
Very good, sir.

44:45.209 --> 44:47.626
Is there anything more you want, sir?

44:47.751 --> 44:49.251
Perhaps.

44:50.042 --> 44:51.917
Come closer, will you?

44:52.667 --> 44:54.251
Yes, sir.

44:57.709 --> 45:00.792
Is there anything you want, sir?

45:08.792 --> 45:12.126
- There. Can she do that for you?
- (Paul chuckles)

45:12.251 --> 45:14.501
I believe you're jealous
of your mistress, Nancy.

45:14.626 --> 45:17.876
Her? (Scoffs)
She's a poor thing.

45:21.751 --> 45:25.834
- It's better than one of us to get excited.
- Yes, Nancy, I believe it is.

45:25.959 --> 45:28.751
You're mine now, aren't you?
'Cause you want me.

45:30.167 --> 45:31.959
And do you want me?

45:32.084 --> 45:34.126
I've always wanted you.

45:34.584 --> 45:36.542
When shall we meet?

45:36.667 --> 45:38.084
I'll let you know.

45:38.209 --> 45:40.667
- Not tonight?
- No, I have to go out again.

45:40.792 --> 45:43.167
Go along now. There's a good girl.

45:43.292 --> 45:44.792
Very well.

45:44.917 --> 45:48.001
You shall be master for a bit longer.

45:55.751 --> 45:57.876
Good night, your lordship.

46:04.542 --> 46:06.501
- Is that you, Cobb?
- Yes, sir.

46:06.626 --> 46:08.001
All quiet?

46:08.126 --> 46:10.001
The constable passed
about 10 minutes ago, sir.

46:10.126 --> 46:13.001
I reckon they can't get back
from that concert before 11:00.

46:13.126 --> 46:16.751
That will give me time to find out
what he gets up to in Number 14.

46:16.876 --> 46:18.334
The only thing is, sir,

46:18.459 --> 46:21.834
I usually meet Nancy when she comes
out at nine o'clock to post the letters.

46:21.959 --> 46:24.584
- She never came.
- We'll have to risk it.

46:38.292 --> 46:40.251
You wait about.

46:41.042 --> 46:45.042
If Nancy does come out,
squeeze her dry...

46:45.167 --> 46:47.209
of information, I mean.

47:35.376 --> 47:37.959
- Good evening, Nancy. You're late.
- Hello, nice of you to wait.

47:38.084 --> 47:39.376
Such goings-on.

47:39.501 --> 47:42.334
Master made us swear things,
kissing the Bible and all.

47:42.459 --> 47:44.501
The master? But I thought
they were at the concert.

47:44.626 --> 47:46.917
Oh, they came back early.
Must've had another row.

47:47.042 --> 47:48.501
Come along,
I've got to take the letters.

47:48.626 --> 47:51.167
Well, look, let me take them for you.
It will save you the trouble.

47:51.292 --> 47:55.001
No, I like a bit of air and a change.

48:19.417 --> 48:22.167
(Door opens and closes)

49:39.209 --> 49:41.626
(Footsteps above)

50:01.459 --> 50:05.251
Upstairs. There's someone moving.
Elizabeth!

50:06.251 --> 50:11.542
- Oh, dear, is there no one?
- It's all right, ma'am. I'm coming.

50:11.667 --> 50:15.792
Elizabeth, there is someone upstairs.
Someone moving.

50:15.917 --> 50:18.209
There, there, ma'am.
Don't take on so.

50:18.334 --> 50:21.792
There isn't anybody in the house.
Only you and me.

50:21.917 --> 50:25.084
You mustn't let yourself imagine things.

50:25.209 --> 50:28.042
Come into your room
and drink your milk.

50:29.334 --> 50:33.876
But I don't imagine things, Elizabeth.
It's true. You can hear it.

50:34.001 --> 50:35.792
Listen.

50:40.251 --> 50:42.167
A moment ago,
the wires on the gas dimmed

50:42.292 --> 50:44.917
as it does when someone turns on
another light in the house.

50:45.042 --> 50:47.501
- Did you turn on another light, Elizabeth?
- No, ma'am.

50:47.626 --> 50:51.751
There's no one in the house but us.
Nancy's out, and the master.

50:51.876 --> 50:54.042
But it did a minute ago.

50:58.959 --> 51:00.292
There, there, ma'am.

51:00.417 --> 51:03.126
There's only something wrong
with the pipes.

51:03.251 --> 51:07.709
You must have dropped off
and been dreaming you heard something.

51:08.792 --> 51:12.042
That's right, Elizabeth. Dreaming.

51:13.334 --> 51:16.709
If I dream things when I'm awake...

51:16.834 --> 51:19.376
I'm going out of my mind, Elizabeth.

51:19.501 --> 51:23.001
Oh, ma'am,
you mustn't say such things.

51:23.126 --> 51:24.376
You know, Elizabeth.

51:24.501 --> 51:28.834
Well, the master
did say something, but...

51:30.001 --> 51:33.626
I once knew a girl
who died in a lunatic asylum.

51:34.709 --> 51:36.959
I remember her eyes.

51:38.751 --> 51:40.959
That was how they first knew.

51:41.917 --> 51:44.501
If there's anything I can do, ma'am?

51:44.626 --> 51:46.667
No, thank you, Elizabeth.

51:47.751 --> 51:50.126
There isn't anything anybody can do.

52:08.459 --> 52:10.584
(Footsteps above)

52:30.667 --> 52:33.584
(D Music box plays)

52:39.626 --> 52:42.042
(Footsteps above)

52:51.876 --> 52:53.417
(Screams)

53:28.584 --> 53:30.876
- Yes, Cobb?
- There's a letter from Australia, sir.

53:31.001 --> 53:33.459
Australia? Give it to me.

53:40.167 --> 53:44.001
- Cobb, I really am a remarkable man.
- Yes, sir?

53:44.126 --> 53:46.126
It's my memory. Amazing.

53:46.251 --> 53:48.959
They shall have it for the museum
when I die.

53:49.084 --> 53:52.251
With any luck, this should help us.

53:54.251 --> 53:56.542
When is Nancy's next night out?

53:56.667 --> 54:01.042
- Well, tonight, sir.
- Yes. I wish it was Mrs Mallen's instead.

54:01.167 --> 54:04.751
Still, it all goes to show that
I'm on the right lines, as usual.

54:04.876 --> 54:08.417
- All I want now is evidence.
- Evidence of what, sir?

54:08.542 --> 54:10.959
Well, I'm certain
that he is Louis Bauer,

54:11.084 --> 54:13.459
and I've a shrewd idea
of what he's up to in that house.

54:13.584 --> 54:15.126
Can't prove it, of course.

54:15.251 --> 54:17.501
The only one who can help us
is that poor woman.

54:17.626 --> 54:18.751
And she's crazy.

54:18.876 --> 54:21.876
She will be
if she stays there much longer.

54:22.376 --> 54:24.792
- Does she know that he's not Mallen?
- I don't think so.

54:24.917 --> 54:27.417
But she knows something.
That's her danger.

54:27.542 --> 54:30.459
That's why we've got to get her
away from him, out of that house.

54:30.584 --> 54:33.126
- That's easier said than done, sir.
- Cobb?

54:33.251 --> 54:35.917
- What is it?
- A gentleman to see the governor.

54:37.417 --> 54:40.626
- It's a stranger, sir. Shall I take...?
- Thank God you're here, sir! Come in!

54:40.751 --> 54:44.167
- I didn't know he was a friend of yours.
- Never seen him in my life before.

54:44.292 --> 54:45.876
- Are you Mr Rough?
- That's right.

54:46.001 --> 54:48.876
- I got your letter. I'm...
- Mr Vincent Ullswater from Devonshire.

54:49.001 --> 54:52.167
Come along and sit down, sir.
I've got a lot to talk to you about.

54:53.084 --> 54:55.251
- Your boots, sir.
- Mm-hmm.

54:57.167 --> 55:00.001
- Mrs Mallen is in her room?
- Yes, sir.

55:00.126 --> 55:02.042
I think she's got a headache, sir.

55:02.167 --> 55:04.959
Did you ever know a time when
Mrs Mallen did no! have a headache?

55:05.084 --> 55:06.501
Hardly ever, sir.

55:06.626 --> 55:08.792
And when is your next evening out,
Nancy?

55:08.917 --> 55:10.542
Tonight, sir.

55:10.667 --> 55:14.209
And where do you usually pass
the evenings with your gentlemen friends?

55:14.334 --> 55:18.209
Walking around the square, sir.
Or in the park.

55:18.334 --> 55:20.834
Then perhaps it would be
departing too much from tradition

55:20.959 --> 55:23.251
if you were to come with me
to a music hall.

55:23.376 --> 55:25.584
Ooh! Do you mean it?

55:26.376 --> 55:28.917
I always mean what I say.

55:29.042 --> 55:32.126
I shall meet you at 7:50
at the corner of the square.

55:32.251 --> 55:34.876
You're a rum 'un. I thought
you was never going to do nothing.

55:35.001 --> 55:36.501
(Bell rings)

55:36.626 --> 55:39.042
That will do, Nancy. Answer the bell.

55:47.792 --> 55:49.667
(Ullswater) ls Mrs Mallen at home?

55:49.792 --> 55:53.626
- (Nancy) What name should I say, sir?
- Her cousin, Mr Ullswater.

55:53.751 --> 55:55.876
Very good, sir.

56:10.751 --> 56:12.792
How do you do?

56:12.917 --> 56:14.584
How do you do?

56:14.709 --> 56:17.167
Will you come in here for a moment?

56:26.167 --> 56:28.876
See that Mrs Mallen
is not informed of this call.

56:29.001 --> 56:30.417
Very good, sir.

56:30.542 --> 56:32.751
I hope you'll forgive me
for calling at this hour,

56:32.876 --> 56:35.334
but I happened to be in London,
and I'd hoped to see Bella.

56:35.459 --> 56:39.292
I'm sorry,
but my wife is unable to see you.

56:41.792 --> 56:45.001
Mr Mallen,
this is a little difficult to explain,

56:45.126 --> 56:47.292
but you may remember
that at the time of your marriage,

56:47.417 --> 56:49.876
there was a slight friction
between us.

56:50.001 --> 56:52.417
I was peculiarly alive to the fact.

56:52.542 --> 56:54.917
My sister and I have long regretted
these differences.

56:55.042 --> 56:57.876
They've kept us separated
from Bella too long.

56:58.001 --> 57:00.251
In your opinion.

57:00.376 --> 57:03.084
We're anxious to see her again,
have her stay with us in Devonshire.

57:03.209 --> 57:05.876
The air always used to do her
so much good down there.

57:06.001 --> 57:08.459
- You're under the impression she's ill?
- Well...

57:08.584 --> 57:10.709
And what has given you
that impression?

57:10.834 --> 57:15.209
- She was never strong.
- I'm the best guardian of my wife's health.

57:15.334 --> 57:17.376
All the same,
I should like to see my cousin.

57:17.501 --> 57:20.584
Bella was with me
when we heard you arrive.

57:20.709 --> 57:22.292
If she had wished to see you,

57:22.417 --> 57:25.792
she wouldn't have asked me
to speak to you down here.

57:25.917 --> 57:27.792
She refused to see me?

57:27.917 --> 57:30.876
The inference appears to me
perfectly clear.

57:31.751 --> 57:33.626
I don't think I like your tone, Mallen.

57:35.334 --> 57:39.167
You're under no obligation
to listen to it, Mr Ullswater.

57:43.209 --> 57:46.667
I'm not going to leave this house
until I see my cousin.

57:48.042 --> 57:51.376
Do you propose to interfere
between a husband and wife?

57:53.251 --> 57:56.376
It would require physical force,
Mr Ullswater.

57:57.584 --> 57:59.834
Nancy, will you please
show this gentleman out?

57:59.959 --> 58:01.917
(Nancy) Yes, sir.

58:19.542 --> 58:21.126
Vincent!

58:31.001 --> 58:33.459
Paul! I've just seen Vincent
out in the square.

58:33.584 --> 58:36.001
- Has he been here?
- Yes, he's been here.

58:39.209 --> 58:41.834
And you let him go
without seeing me.

58:44.417 --> 58:46.334
Paul, why didn't you tell me?

58:47.709 --> 58:50.667
- So you did write to him?
- Write?

58:51.917 --> 58:53.709
Against my express orders,

58:53.834 --> 58:57.251
you went behind my back
and complained to your cousins.

58:57.376 --> 59:00.209
But I didn't.
I've never written to them.

59:00.334 --> 59:03.626
- How did he know this address?
- I don't know.

59:03.751 --> 59:07.292
- Or that you'd been ill?
- I don't know.

59:07.417 --> 59:10.251
- What else did you tell him?
- Nothing. I never wrote.

59:10.376 --> 59:12.751
What lies about me
have you told him?

59:12.876 --> 59:15.459
Paul, if I had written, which I didn't,

59:15.584 --> 59:18.584
do you suppose I'd have said a word
to my cousins against my husband?

59:18.709 --> 59:22.167
Do you think I can trust
the insane ravings of a madwoman?

59:26.542 --> 59:29.667
- Paul, don't say that.
- Your mind is diseased!

59:30.584 --> 59:32.917
You are as witless as an animal!

59:38.042 --> 59:39.542
Paul.

59:39.667 --> 59:40.959
I'm desperate.

59:41.084 --> 59:43.542
If I do the things you say,
then I am going mad.

59:44.834 --> 59:47.334
It's when you're angry
with me like this...

59:48.167 --> 59:51.667
My head aches,
and my mind gets tired.

59:52.876 --> 59:55.126
You must help me, Paul.

59:55.251 --> 59:57.917
If you were afflicted,
I would be gentle.

59:58.042 --> 01:00:00.126
I should love you more.

01:00:00.251 --> 01:00:02.167
Let go of my arm.

01:00:03.459 --> 01:00:05.876
Paul, how can you be so cruel?

01:00:07.542 --> 01:00:09.292
You used not to be.

01:00:10.126 --> 01:00:14.626
It's only since we came
to this hateful, horrible house

01:00:14.751 --> 01:00:16.876
that everything's changed.

01:00:18.876 --> 01:00:21.626
It must be
because of that envelope I found.

01:00:23.876 --> 01:00:25.376
Who was Louis Bauer?

01:00:25.501 --> 01:00:29.167
There's no such person
as Louis Bauer.

01:00:29.292 --> 01:00:31.792
Then why should that
have changed our lives,

01:00:31.917 --> 01:00:34.084
just a name on an old envelope?

01:00:34.209 --> 01:00:36.417
There was never even an envelope!

01:00:38.042 --> 01:00:40.001
That was the beginning
of your madness,

01:00:40.126 --> 01:00:42.251
when I realised
you were a half-witted creature

01:00:42.376 --> 01:00:45.126
who pried through my desk
and my papers.

01:00:45.251 --> 01:00:47.001
But this is the end.

01:00:47.126 --> 01:00:49.751
You're not only mad,
you are dangerous!

01:00:50.834 --> 01:00:52.959
You are going
to see a doctor, madam.

01:00:53.084 --> 01:00:55.501
No, Paul, not a doctor.

01:00:55.626 --> 01:00:58.667
More than one doctor
tomorrow morning.

01:00:58.792 --> 01:01:00.667
I'm too tired.

01:01:01.834 --> 01:01:03.667
Paul, did you ever love me?

01:01:04.834 --> 01:01:06.792
I hate you.

01:01:06.917 --> 01:01:09.209
You are utterly repulsive to me.

01:01:16.959 --> 01:01:18.751
Louis Bauer.

01:01:27.917 --> 01:01:30.792
What I can't understand
is my cousin not wanting to see me.

01:01:30.917 --> 01:01:32.376
You've only got his word for it.

01:01:32.501 --> 01:01:34.751
She's his wife.
I couldn't force him to let me see her.

01:01:34.876 --> 01:01:36.917
Surely there must be something
we can do to help her.

01:01:37.042 --> 01:01:38.584
Nothing you can do now.

01:01:38.709 --> 01:01:42.042
It won't do to let him get really afraid
of your interference.

01:01:42.167 --> 01:01:45.501
- My cab will take you back to your hotel.
- It's very kind of you.

01:01:45.626 --> 01:01:48.334
I hate leaving you to deal with this.
After all, I am her cousin.

01:01:48.459 --> 01:01:50.834
Well, I can perhaps use methods
that you can't.

01:01:50.959 --> 01:01:54.084
I may need your influence to get
a warrant, if I can't get my evidence.

01:01:54.209 --> 01:01:55.209
Good.

01:01:55.334 --> 01:01:58.126
But he won't risk anything
that'll lead to an inquiry afterwards.

- What's the trouble?

01:02:11.626 --> 01:02:13.126
- It's Mrs Mallen.
- What's happened?

01:02:13.251 --> 01:02:15.292
- He's going to have her certified.
- How do you know?

01:02:15.417 --> 01:02:18.251
- Well, Nancy heard...
- Come to the point, boy.

01:02:18.376 --> 01:02:20.834
Well, I waited, and I saw Nancy
and Mr Mallen get into a cab.

01:02:20.959 --> 01:02:23.876
- Where have they gone?
- To Canterbury Music Hall.

01:02:24.001 --> 01:02:25.792
- This is our chance.
- Where are we going?

01:02:25.917 --> 01:02:28.084

The whole of this house
was ransacked.

01:05:47.376 --> 01:05:50.251
The murderer had searched
for those rubies all through the night.

01:05:50.376 --> 01:05:53.584
And the opinion of the police was that
he'd found them and vanished with them.

01:05:53.709 --> 01:05:56.626
- And they never caught him?
- No.

01:05:56.751 --> 01:06:00.001
But suppose he didn't find
those rubies after all.

01:06:00.126 --> 01:06:01.876
Suppose they were concealed

01:06:02.001 --> 01:06:06.376
in the walls or the floor
of old Alice Barlow's bedroom,

01:06:06.501 --> 01:06:08.834

just starting.

I've had enough.
Come along now, please.

01:06:49.376 --> 01:06:51.917
That's what's made me sure
my mind is going.

01:06:52.042 --> 01:06:53.917
Lying in my room
watching the gaslight,

01:06:54.042 --> 01:06:56.792
listening for someone
in a place where no one can go.

01:06:56.917 --> 01:06:59.917
Yes, they can. Along the roof
from the empty house next door.

01:07:00.042 --> 01:07:03.459
- But what are you saying?
- It fits. It all fits.

01:07:03.584 --> 01:07:06.917
Tell me, have you ever heard
the name Louis Bauer?

01:07:07.042 --> 01:07:09.001
It's a trap!
I never said I found that envelope.

01:07:09.126 --> 01:07:11.292
- No, no.
- It's a lie. Go away. Leave this house.

01:07:11.417 --> 01:07:14.042
Come, come. Good girl.

01:07:14.751 --> 01:07:17.542
What do you know
about Louis Bauer?

01:07:17.667 --> 01:07:19.334
I found...

01:07:19.459 --> 01:07:22.584
I thought I found an envelope
addressed to him.

01:07:22.709 --> 01:07:24.459
It was when we first came here.

01:07:24.584 --> 01:07:27.667
- That's what started my...
- I've got it. I've solved it. I've saved you!

01:07:27.792 --> 01:07:31.501
- God, what a marvellous man I am!
- What are you talking about?

01:07:31.626 --> 01:07:34.542
Your Mr Mallen is my Mr Louis Bauer.

01:07:34.667 --> 01:07:37.126
A criminal maniac
who murdered his aunt

01:07:37.251 --> 01:07:39.917
and steals back
to his own house at night,

01:07:40.042 --> 01:07:44.251
still searching for those rubies
he couldn't find 20 years ago.

01:07:44.376 --> 01:07:48.876
And every time he lights the gas up
in that room, so it dims down here.

01:07:51.001 --> 01:07:53.459
And when the light brightens, I...

01:07:53.584 --> 01:07:57.584
I hear his key in the door
a few minutes afterwards.

01:07:57.709 --> 01:08:00.334
I can't stand it. My mind...

01:08:00.459 --> 01:08:03.751
No, you are not going out of your mind,
Mrs Mallen.

01:08:03.876 --> 01:08:06.709
You're slowly and methodically
being driven out of your mind.

01:08:06.834 --> 01:08:09.709
Why? Because, quite by accident,
you got onto his identity,

01:08:09.834 --> 01:08:11.501
and that made you dangerous to him.

01:08:11.626 --> 01:08:15.001
He couldn't get rid of you
by ordinary means, for fear of an inquiry.

01:08:15.126 --> 01:08:19.459
So he's driving you mad, in order
to discredit anything that you say

01:08:19.584 --> 01:08:21.792
as the ravings of a lunatic.

01:08:21.917 --> 01:08:24.584
Thank God you're not married to him.

01:08:25.792 --> 01:08:28.042
- Not married to him?
- Certainly not.

01:08:28.167 --> 01:08:32.042
He married another lady long before
he met you, and she's still alive.

01:08:38.501 --> 01:08:39.501
How do you know?

01:08:39.626 --> 01:08:42.709
I've been finding out things
about Mr Louis Bauer.

01:08:42.834 --> 01:08:45.792
- Where is this woman?
- That's the trouble. Australia.

01:08:45.917 --> 01:08:49.209
That's three months away.
By then it would be too late to save you.

01:08:49.334 --> 01:08:51.751
That's why you've got to give me
the evidence we need.

01:08:51.876 --> 01:08:54.709
- What evidence?
- Any proof of Louis Bauer's identity.

01:08:54.834 --> 01:08:57.459
- But I don't know where to find it.
- Tell me where to look.

01:08:57.584 --> 01:08:59.584
- Yes, but...
- In here?

01:09:01.084 --> 01:09:03.334
You don't understand.

01:09:03.459 --> 01:09:05.334
To me, he's still my husband.

01:09:06.251 --> 01:09:07.792
I couldn't betray my husband.

01:09:07.917 --> 01:09:11.001
You mean the man who betrayed you
into thinking you were married to him?

01:09:11.126 --> 01:09:14.042
That's different.
That was before I knew him.

01:09:14.167 --> 01:09:16.917
We've lived together
as husband and wife.

01:09:17.042 --> 01:09:19.334
If I betrayed him,
I'd be betraying myself.

01:09:19.459 --> 01:09:21.209
Even though I tell you at this moment

01:09:21.334 --> 01:09:24.251
he's sitting in a music hall
with another woman?

01:09:24.376 --> 01:09:26.209
Your parlour maid.

01:09:27.209 --> 01:09:28.792
Is that true?

01:09:28.917 --> 01:09:32.709
It's hard to take everything from you,
but I'm afraid it is.

01:09:39.959 --> 01:09:42.084
You go straight in,
and I'll follow you in a moment.

01:09:42.209 --> 01:09:45.459
- What you gonna do?
- Take a little stroll.

01:09:45.584 --> 01:09:47.876
Will we go out again?

01:09:48.001 --> 01:09:49.792
I'll let you know.

01:09:49.917 --> 01:09:53.126
(D Humming

01:09:53.251 --> 01:09:54.876
I know you will.

01:10:00.417 --> 01:10:04.542
- He keeps his papers in there.
- Then this is where we start.

01:10:04.667 --> 01:10:06.084
- But it's locked.
- Good!

01:10:06.209 --> 01:10:09.084
That means there are probably some
things inside that are very interesting.

01:10:09.209 --> 01:10:10.584
Do you mind if I take me coat off?

01:10:10.709 --> 01:10:13.584
I always work much better
with me coat off.

01:10:13.709 --> 01:10:16.334
- Saucy shirt, isn't it?
- What are you going to do?

01:10:16.459 --> 01:10:18.501
There's only two things
I've ever wanted to be.

01:10:18.626 --> 01:10:22.792
A gardener or a burglar.
Both of them nice, quiet occupations.

01:10:31.917 --> 01:10:34.501
This is tougher than I thought.

01:10:37.167 --> 01:10:39.251
- You mustn't force it.
- Afraid I'll have to.

01:10:39.376 --> 01:10:40.959
But what shall I say
when he comes back?

01:10:41.084 --> 01:10:44.501
Don't you realise it's tonight or never?
Tomorrow he wants to get you certified.

01:10:44.626 --> 01:10:48.751
If we go back, we're lost.
We must gamble on finding something.

01:10:48.876 --> 01:10:52.209
- Now, are you with me?
- All right. Force it, but be quick.

01:10:52.334 --> 01:10:55.459
There's no hurry, ma'am.
He's quite happy where he is.

01:10:55.584 --> 01:10:59.667
I don't like these violent methods.
Makes me feel like a dentist.

01:11:01.667 --> 01:11:03.334
All over now.

01:11:09.001 --> 01:11:10.626
Drawn a blank so far.

01:11:10.751 --> 01:11:12.376
Give me the keys.

01:11:12.501 --> 01:11:15.042
I suppose he keeps his papers in here.

01:11:16.126 --> 01:11:17.876
(Grunts)

01:11:20.542 --> 01:11:22.251
Huh!

01:11:23.417 --> 01:11:26.417
Look! He's back. He's upstairs.

01:11:26.542 --> 01:11:28.876
- Oh, I'm afraid.
- How long does he usually stay?

01:11:29.001 --> 01:11:32.959
- Any time. An hour, 10 minutes.
- We shall want longer than that.

01:11:34.584 --> 01:11:36.042
There.

01:11:37.334 --> 01:11:40.417
That's done for, I'm afraid,
but we shall have to risk it. Come along.

01:11:40.542 --> 01:11:41.751
Come along.

01:11:41.876 --> 01:11:43.876
- I can't see him. I daren't.
- You shan't.

01:11:44.001 --> 01:11:46.084
Go right up to your room,
lock yourself in,

01:11:46.209 --> 01:11:49.709
and don't come out,
in any circumstances, until I tell you.

01:11:50.459 --> 01:11:52.459
You're not going.
You won't leave the house?

01:11:52.584 --> 01:11:54.292
- Of course not.
- But Elizabeth?

01:11:54.417 --> 01:11:56.709
Don't you worry about Elizabeth.
I've squared her.

01:11:56.834 --> 01:12:00.459
And remember, you're all right
so long as you stay in your room.

01:12:15.376 --> 01:12:17.501
(Door opens)

01:12:42.417 --> 01:12:44.376
Bella?

01:13:05.417 --> 01:13:07.334
I brought you milk.

01:13:08.084 --> 01:13:11.542
Go upstairs and tell Mrs Mallen
she's to come down here at once.

01:13:11.667 --> 01:13:13.542
Just like that, sir?

01:13:14.667 --> 01:13:16.417
Very good, sir.

01:13:30.792 --> 01:13:33.251
(Nancy) Are you there, ma'am?

01:13:34.292 --> 01:13:37.667
Master says you're to come
to the drawing room at once.

01:13:49.792 --> 01:13:52.751
She won't answer.
She's got the door locked. I tried it.

01:13:52.876 --> 01:13:57.792
- All right, Nancy. Go to bed.
- I've got to let the dog out first.

01:13:57.917 --> 01:14:01.167
You needn't worry about the dog.
Go to bed.

01:14:02.292 --> 01:14:04.792
What's the game?
What are you up to, eh?

01:14:04.917 --> 01:14:08.876
Will you kindly remember that
you're not a guest in this house?

01:14:09.001 --> 01:14:10.834
All right, all right.

01:14:24.376 --> 01:14:27.042
(Paul) Bella, I have your dog here.

01:14:27.167 --> 01:14:29.751
I found it in the drawing room
where you know it is not allowed.

01:14:29.876 --> 01:14:31.667
Dog? Paul, no!

01:14:31.792 --> 01:14:34.792
No! Don't hurt it, I'm coming!

01:14:35.834 --> 01:14:37.459
I'm coming.

01:14:40.792 --> 01:14:42.876
Give me the dog.

01:14:43.001 --> 01:14:45.334
- What have you done with it?
- Dog? What dog?

01:14:45.459 --> 01:14:47.834
You said you had it. Have you hurt it?

01:14:47.959 --> 01:14:50.209
I haven't seen your dog.

01:14:50.334 --> 01:14:52.292
Another of your dreams.

01:14:52.417 --> 01:14:56.042
Like the one in which
you dared break open my desk!

01:14:56.167 --> 01:14:57.834
Dream?

01:15:00.584 --> 01:15:05.376
Don't tell me it was a dream,
that he never came here.

01:15:05.501 --> 01:15:07.209
He?

01:15:07.334 --> 01:15:09.542
Who came?

01:15:09.667 --> 01:15:11.876
Tell me about this dream of yours.

01:15:12.959 --> 01:15:16.626
I dreamed that a man came in here.

01:15:18.667 --> 01:15:22.126
- A dream.
- I know you dreamed.

01:15:22.251 --> 01:15:24.667
But tell me about the man.

01:15:26.501 --> 01:15:28.709
Speak, will you?

01:15:28.834 --> 01:15:32.167
- I want to know more about the man!
- I dreamed and I...

01:15:33.417 --> 01:15:36.876
- A dream!
- Was I a part of this curious dream?

01:15:38.042 --> 01:15:39.292
Who are you?

01:15:39.417 --> 01:15:42.626
Apparently a mere figment
of this lady's imagination.

01:15:44.917 --> 01:15:46.417
How did you get in?

01:15:46.542 --> 01:15:49.042
We ghosts don't have
to bother about doors.

01:15:49.167 --> 01:15:53.167
- If you don't tell me your business...
- I came to call upon another ghost.

01:15:53.292 --> 01:15:57.709
The ghost of the man who murdered
Alice Barlow in this very room.

01:15:59.334 --> 01:16:02.334
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

01:16:02.459 --> 01:16:06.334
Haven't you, Mr Louis Bauer?

01:16:09.834 --> 01:16:13.126
- My name is Mallen.
- No, it isn't.

01:16:14.542 --> 01:16:18.209
You've been listening
to my wife's insane ramblings?

01:16:18.876 --> 01:16:22.709
Correct. Except that she isn't insane,
nor is she your wife.

01:16:23.917 --> 01:16:28.626
You dare to break into my house.
You tamper with my desk!

01:16:29.376 --> 01:16:34.876
Where you and I know lies the evidence
that you are Louis Bauer.

01:16:37.042 --> 01:16:38.334
(Laughs)

01:16:49.584 --> 01:16:51.334
Here's what you want.

01:16:51.459 --> 01:16:53.751
It will give me great pleasure
to see you make a fool of yourself

01:16:53.876 --> 01:16:56.459
before I throw you out of the house!

01:16:58.167 --> 01:17:00.334
Hmm. Seems to be nothing here.

01:17:02.501 --> 01:17:04.167
(Bella) My brooch.

01:17:11.209 --> 01:17:14.709
Then it's true.
You did hide my things.

01:17:14.834 --> 01:17:17.751
You laid traps for me
and said that I lied to you.

01:17:19.001 --> 01:17:22.917
I found the brooch only today and put it
aside until I could give it back to you.

01:17:23.042 --> 01:17:25.167
Give it to me.

01:17:25.292 --> 01:17:26.917
This isn't your brooch.

01:17:27.042 --> 01:17:28.917
I gave it to my wife
as an engagement present.

01:17:29.042 --> 01:17:30.376
Where did you get it from?

01:17:30.501 --> 01:17:31.917
- It's second-hand.
- How do you know?

01:17:32.042 --> 01:17:34.167
- There's an inscription in it.
- Where? Where?

01:17:35.334 --> 01:17:38.126
(Bella) Inside. It's a trick.
I discovered it by accident.

01:17:38.251 --> 01:17:39.959
Show me.

01:17:41.626 --> 01:17:43.792
"To A.B."

01:17:43.917 --> 01:17:46.834
- What are these?
- There were some sort of stones in it.

01:17:46.959 --> 01:17:48.334
Stones? Where are they? Quick.

01:17:48.459 --> 01:17:51.917
They were loose, so I took them out
and put them in here.

01:17:54.001 --> 01:17:55.334
There you are!

01:17:55.459 --> 01:17:59.251
Alice Barlow's brooch,
Alice Barlow's rubies.

01:17:59.376 --> 01:18:01.751
£20,000 worth.

01:18:01.876 --> 01:18:06.626
This brooch and these rubies
are going to send you to the gallows.

01:18:06.751 --> 01:18:08.626
Give them to me.

01:18:12.292 --> 01:18:14.334
Get out of the room quickly.

01:18:17.376 --> 01:18:18.792
Look!

01:18:24.334 --> 01:18:26.459
Help! Oh, quick, hurry!

01:19:10.626 --> 01:19:12.917
That will hold him.
We shan't need any more.

01:19:13.042 --> 01:19:14.667
Did you get my message
through to Mr Ullswater?

01:19:14.792 --> 01:19:17.292
- Yes, sir.
- You go for the police now, and hurry.

01:19:17.417 --> 01:19:19.626
Very good, sir.

01:19:19.751 --> 01:19:22.917
It's all over now, ma'am.
You can go along up to your room.

01:19:23.042 --> 01:19:26.251
- I'll deal with the servants.
- (Paul moans)

01:19:34.042 --> 01:19:38.167
I want to speak to my wife. Alone.

01:19:38.292 --> 01:19:40.167
You go up to your room.

01:19:41.084 --> 01:19:46.167
-I, too, want to speak to my husband.
- No, you'll only be torturing yourself.

01:19:46.292 --> 01:19:48.626
I want to speak to him alone.

01:19:49.584 --> 01:19:51.959
Very well, if you insist.

01:19:52.084 --> 01:19:55.376
I don't suppose...
I'll hear you if you call.

01:20:02.084 --> 01:20:05.209
Bella. Quick, Bella, the rubies.

01:20:05.334 --> 01:20:08.001
Help me to get away,
and give me them.

01:20:09.917 --> 01:20:11.542
Rubies?

01:20:12.792 --> 01:20:14.626
How you lusted for them.

01:20:18.376 --> 01:20:19.876
Look at them.

01:20:20.751 --> 01:20:22.834
- Look.
- Bella, hurry.

01:20:24.126 --> 01:20:28.292
Get the knife there in the drawer.
Cut me free and give them to me.

01:20:29.292 --> 01:20:31.792
Quick, Bella. Cut the rope here.

01:20:33.001 --> 01:20:34.542
Take the knife.

01:20:40.876 --> 01:20:42.292
Knife?

01:20:43.876 --> 01:20:45.626
What knife?

01:20:48.001 --> 01:20:51.792
Are you suggesting this is a knife
I have in my hand?

01:20:53.876 --> 01:20:57.001
Have you gone mad,
my sane husband?

01:20:58.834 --> 01:21:01.334
There was a knife, but I lost it.

01:21:02.417 --> 01:21:07.417
I always hide things away,
because I'm mad.

01:21:07.542 --> 01:21:10.376
- Bella, what are you saying?
- Rubies.

01:21:10.501 --> 01:21:12.834
You killed a woman for them.

01:21:14.167 --> 01:21:17.167
And me, you tried to kill my mind.

01:21:18.292 --> 01:21:22.626
You made me mad.
"Witless as an animal," you said.

01:21:25.542 --> 01:21:29.501
Now you're helpless, and I'm mad.

01:21:31.084 --> 01:21:33.376
(Shouts) Bella!

01:22:03.459 --> 01:22:06.334
- No!
- Better let him hold them.

01:22:22.834 --> 01:22:24.917
The rubies.
