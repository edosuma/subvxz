00:24.153 --> 00:27.589
Stan-my-man!
You should really check this out.

00:33.313 --> 00:35.304
Ah, never mind.

00:59.873 --> 01:01.864
And they call us crazy.

01:25.193 --> 01:27.229
It's my chance! I'm outta here.

01:27.313 --> 01:30.146
Huh? Yeah, I'm gonna miss our talks too.

01:30.793 --> 01:32.590
Take care, OK?

02:23.913 --> 02:25.904
Agent White?

02:26.913 --> 02:29.746
It's beautiful, isn't it?

02:29.833 --> 02:33.348
Yes, sir. I just wanted to remind you,

02:33.433 --> 02:38.143
you've got an eight o'clock with the chief
of police to discuss jurisdictional issues.

02:38.233 --> 02:40.428
Right.

02:40.713 --> 02:43.944
Is it just me, or was this job
more fun when we were covert,

02:44.033 --> 02:46.593
hunting transgenics all on our own?

02:47.393 --> 02:50.624
It's getting late, sir.
You should probably knock off.

02:50.713 --> 02:52.669
What, and miss the show?

02:53.393 --> 02:57.432
- It only happens once a year.
- Really?

02:57.513 --> 02:59.549
Didn't know you were into astronomy.

02:59.633 --> 03:03.592
There's a fair number of things
you don't know about me, Otto.

03:03.673 --> 03:06.028
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

03:12.233 --> 03:14.588
Gas up the generator.

03:14.673 --> 03:17.824
- Got anything?
- It's all quiet on the transgenic front.

03:17.913 --> 03:20.950
- Let's hope it stays that way.
- Hey, little fella.

03:21.033 --> 03:25.948
Logan managed to grab this out of
his apartment before White's guys trashed it.

03:26.553 --> 03:28.828
- I'll have to thank him.
- What is that symbol?

03:28.913 --> 03:31.552
Father told me
the two snakes interwind together.

03:31.633 --> 03:36.263
Sort of a Caduceus. You know the wand
carried by Hermes, messenger of the gods?

03:36.353 --> 03:37.991
Messenger. Like you.

03:38.073 --> 03:43.352
The Greeks adapted it from a more ancient
Babylonian symbol representing fertility.

03:43.433 --> 03:44.953
I read a lot.

03:44.953 --> 03:45.430
I read a lot.

03:46.433 --> 03:50.187
All I know is it's the same symbol
White's breeding cult uses.

03:50.273 --> 03:53.788
I hate to say this but maybe Sandeman
was involved with them somehow.

03:54.113 --> 03:55.102
No, Max.

03:55.273 --> 03:59.266
- These are major bad guys. I'm wondering...
- I don't like you wondering.

03:59.353 --> 04:01.344
Father was a good guy.

04:02.633 --> 04:05.272
- I remember.
- If you say so.

04:07.593 --> 04:11.427
Good or bad, if Sandeman did create
Manticore, he was one strange dude.

04:11.513 --> 04:14.550
- Look at us. What was he thinking?
- And why did he bother?

04:14.633 --> 04:17.351
- Humans hate us.
- Feeling's mutual.

04:18.153 --> 04:20.713
People afraid of things they don't understand.

04:20.793 --> 04:23.261
We have a transgenic heading eastbound...

04:23.353 --> 04:26.231
- What's goin' on?
- Transgenic. Cops got him on the run.

04:26.313 --> 04:30.465
- Location?
- Sector Five. Heading east on Fourth.

04:30.633 --> 04:32.863
- White's men are on their way.
- So are mine.

04:35.753 --> 04:40.588
No. First thing we did together was the
Volkovitch job, in Kezmikistan or wherever.

04:40.673 --> 04:45.064
Oh, yeah. That's right. The off-hours were
definitely the highlight of that mission.

04:45.393 --> 04:47.463
- Lola.
- Yeah.

04:47.553 --> 04:49.862
Hang on.

04:49.953 --> 04:51.944
Yeah?

04:52.913 --> 04:54.790
We'll meet her there. Let's go.

04:56.673 --> 04:59.267
Just a few more minutes
till we get the all clear.

04:59.353 --> 05:02.345
There's something going down
in Sector Five.

05:06.673 --> 05:08.868
- Ready?
- I'm always ready.

05:09.033 --> 05:11.024
Funny. That's what Lola said.

05:19.393 --> 05:23.545
- Jam Pony messenger!
- Got a pick-up for Harbor Lights Hospital.

05:30.793 --> 05:33.466
This is White. All units, form a perimeter.

05:43.753 --> 05:45.744
- Don't move!
- Freeze!

05:58.753 --> 06:00.744
Come on!

06:42.313 --> 06:44.543
Here they come! Open the gate!

06:52.873 --> 06:54.431
Way to go, guys.

06:54.513 --> 06:56.663
- You OK, pal?
- I am now.

06:56.753 --> 06:58.584
Welcome to Terminal City.

07:38.593 --> 07:40.584
What ya got there, boss?

07:42.953 --> 07:45.751
"Coalition for a Transgenic-free Seattle."

07:45.833 --> 07:48.506
The mutants are getting organised.
We are too.

07:48.593 --> 07:50.231
Yeah. It's a good idea.

07:50.313 --> 07:54.431
It's not the ones that look like monsters
we gotta worry about, it's the X-series.

07:54.513 --> 07:57.311
They look just like you and me,
so you really can't tell.

07:58.113 --> 08:01.901
Hey! Don't ride the motorcycle inside!

08:01.993 --> 08:06.111
Cut him some slack, Normal. Biggs has
already been on three runs this morning.

08:06.193 --> 08:09.503
- I'm ready for my next one, boss.
- I told you he was a good worker.

08:09.593 --> 08:13.791
And my idea to do deliveries on motorcycles
has upped our efficiency by, what, 15%?

08:13.873 --> 08:18.742
Yes, Moto-Pony is a huge success.
Doesn't mean you can ride the hogs indoors.

08:19.553 --> 08:22.272
Did you get those sector passes
I wanted for these guys?

08:22.353 --> 08:24.992
- What? Yeah. Here.
- Perfect.

08:25.073 --> 08:27.587
There you go. Happy riding.

08:33.352 --> 08:35.582
That is one fine transgenic sister.

08:36.793 --> 08:40.547
Vigilance, yeah? They're everywhere, people.

08:40.633 --> 08:43.022
Fair city's become Transgenic Central.

08:43.113 --> 08:45.673
Don't be afraid to rat out
friends and neighbours.

08:45.753 --> 08:48.825
Normal, how do we know
that you're not a transgenic

08:48.913 --> 08:52.303
that's just running a game
so nobody'll suspect you?

08:55.793 --> 08:58.227
Normal's calling for vigilance.

08:58.313 --> 09:01.828
Meanwhile, Jam Pony's home
to the transgenic underground.

09:03.513 --> 09:05.868
Keeps backfiring on me.

09:05.953 --> 09:08.706
Timing must be off. I'll take care of it.

09:11.553 --> 09:14.306
Anybody home?

09:14.593 --> 09:18.506
Hey, Logan. Adjust your camera.
You're a little off-centre.

09:20.393 --> 09:22.782
- How's that?
- Much better.

09:22.993 --> 09:24.870
How's the new digs, Logan?

09:24.953 --> 09:27.262
Pretty sweet. Thanks for letting me crash.

09:27.353 --> 09:29.787
No problem. You need anything?

09:29.953 --> 09:33.992
Yeah. Talked to Eyes Only. He's trying
to get his operation up and running again.

09:34.073 --> 09:37.622
Takes some sophisticated hardware
to pull off his cable hacks.

09:38.473 --> 09:42.466
Getting on the air isn't the hard part.
It's not getting traced.

09:42.553 --> 09:43.393
- What does he need?
- IT server.

09:43.393 --> 09:44.985
- What does he need?
- IT server.

09:46.073 --> 09:48.382
A couple of C-34 processors, for starters.

09:48.793 --> 09:52.468
I'll look around.
You Ordinaries - no offence -

09:52.553 --> 09:56.068
left a lot of good stuff behind
when you cleared outta Terminal City.

09:56.153 --> 10:00.066
- Appreciate it.
- Hey, Mole! Look what I got.

10:00.513 --> 10:02.981
Hey, little fella.

10:03.073 --> 10:05.633
- What's up?
- Logan's on TV.

10:12.153 --> 10:14.667
- Hey, you.
- Hey yourself.

10:14.793 --> 10:17.830
It doesn't exactly have
the penthouse view. How's it going?

10:18.473 --> 10:20.543
Warm and dry. Can't complain.

10:21.513 --> 10:23.868
- How you doing?
- All right.

10:24.113 --> 10:25.990
Good.

10:26.393 --> 10:28.384
Is that Alec I heard?

10:30.233 --> 10:31.461
Yeah.

10:31.553 --> 10:34.306
- How's he doing?
- Good.

10:34.433 --> 10:36.025
Good.

10:36.353 --> 10:40.551
So... catch you later?

10:42.233 --> 10:44.588
Yeah. See ya, Max.

10:44.953 --> 10:46.784
See ya.

10:52.033 --> 10:54.024
Each place worse than the last.

10:54.113 --> 10:57.549
We'll never find anything
Logan can use in this dump.

10:57.633 --> 10:59.624
Here we go.

11:01.633 --> 11:04.466
- This looks salvageable.
- Good. Can we go now?

11:04.993 --> 11:08.224
"Advanced Recombinant Genetics" -
wonder who they were.

11:10.873 --> 11:13.433
So how are you and Logan?

11:14.353 --> 11:16.503
I'm just making conversation, Max.

11:16.593 --> 11:18.629
It's over. I already told you that.

11:18.713 --> 11:22.706
- Why was he asking about me?
- Just making conversation, Alec.

11:26.393 --> 11:28.748
- What?
- Look at that.

11:30.233 --> 11:33.748
- What the hell's that doing here?
- I don't know. Can we please go now?

11:33.833 --> 11:35.630
What is it with these snakes?

11:35.713 --> 11:39.501
It's like Ames White and his Familiars
are following me around.

11:39.593 --> 11:43.302
Ames White and his Familiars.
Kinda sounds like a rock band.

11:49.553 --> 11:51.748
They hurt you, George?

11:54.113 --> 11:56.832
I know. Does sound like a rock band.

11:56.913 --> 12:01.350
Question is, how do they know about all that?

12:01.433 --> 12:03.708
It's a good thing you scared them off.

12:03.793 --> 12:06.591
Now we got the place to ourselves.

12:12.833 --> 12:15.472
- So what am I looking at here?
- Thermal imager.

12:15.553 --> 12:19.944
- Fifth generation, very high sensitivity.
- And I should care about this because?

12:23.913 --> 12:26.143
- Why is he in here?
- Take a look.

12:26.513 --> 12:28.424
See how the image is whiter?

12:28.513 --> 12:32.392
The X-series run an average
basal body temperature of a 101.8°.

12:32.513 --> 12:34.663
Three degrees higher than a human being.

12:34.753 --> 12:37.472
Scan the crowd with
the thermal gating set at 100...

12:37.553 --> 12:39.544
It picks up transgenics.

12:39.633 --> 12:43.228
Otto, my friend,
you have earned your pay this week.

12:43.673 --> 12:47.029
Requisition as many of these as you can.
Get 'em in the field ASAP.

12:47.113 --> 12:48.751
- White.
- He's escaped.

12:48.833 --> 12:49.353
Escaped? When?

12:49.353 --> 12:51.025
Escaped? When?

12:51.113 --> 12:53.422
Last night. During the ceremony.

12:53.513 --> 12:56.073
- Any leads?
- No. But we'll find him.

12:56.153 --> 12:58.542
We'd better. He knows too much.

13:09.073 --> 13:12.907
- Will you quit doing that?
- It's hot as hell in here.

13:12.993 --> 13:16.110
These Arctic Division guys,
always complaining.

13:16.193 --> 13:18.991
Listen to him,
with his little space heater over there.

13:19.153 --> 13:23.226
When we took out Saddam, we did
50 clicks across the desert in one day.

13:23.313 --> 13:27.067
The Siberian campaign, we did
60 clicks through the snow in one night.

13:27.153 --> 13:31.112
- I'm talking 115°.
- Wind chill 30 below.

13:31.233 --> 13:33.224
- Baking sun.
- Driving snow.

13:34.513 --> 13:37.823
What do I know?
They made me to dig trenches.

13:40.753 --> 13:43.347
We got to get this over
to Logan right away.

13:45.033 --> 13:47.422
Can't see me near the mutant parade. I'll do it.

13:47.513 --> 13:49.105
- You don't have to.
- I don't mind.

13:49.193 --> 13:53.345
I can ask Biggs to bring it when he gets here.

13:53.433 --> 13:56.789
I understand why you won't go, but I can go.
The sooner the better.

13:56.873 --> 13:59.068
- Leave it.
- What's your problem?

14:00.713 --> 14:04.069
I guess you're gonna find out sooner or later.

14:04.633 --> 14:07.386
- I told Logan you and me were together.
- What?

14:07.553 --> 14:09.987
- I'm sorry, I had to.
- Are you kidding?

14:10.073 --> 14:15.466
This virus thing isn't going anywhere
and I can't afford any more accidents.

14:16.313 --> 14:19.589
- Why do you have to drag me into it?
- I had to push him away.

14:19.673 --> 14:24.383
So blame Alec, cos he's just the kind
of jerk that'd steal another guy's girl.

14:25.633 --> 14:27.430
Please don't.

14:27.513 --> 14:31.791
Max, whatever's going on with you
and Logan has nothing to do with me, OK?

14:31.873 --> 14:33.864
I'm not gonna be the bad guy.

15:09.353 --> 15:10.513
Thought you didn't need
that thing to walk any more.

15:10.513 --> 15:12.071
Thought you didn't need
that thing to walk any more.

15:12.153 --> 15:14.826
- I don't.
- So is it more like an enhancer, then?

15:14.993 --> 15:18.827
Something like that.
What are you doing here?

15:18.913 --> 15:22.110
- I got that computer hardware you wanted.
- Thanks.

15:22.193 --> 15:24.184
Yeah, no problem.

15:25.993 --> 15:30.464
- Listen. This thing with Max and I...
- Yeah, she told me.

15:31.073 --> 15:35.430
If you're here to apologise or explain
how it happened, I'm not real interested.

15:35.513 --> 15:38.152
- No, no. You've got it all wrong.
- Listen.

15:38.233 --> 15:41.623
We've been through
some rough times, me and Max,

15:42.713 --> 15:44.704
but I never gave up on us.

15:48.593 --> 15:50.584
I always figured we'd get through it.

15:51.073 --> 15:55.225
Now I guess...
I dunno, I'm thinking maybe...

15:56.033 --> 15:58.024
I've been selfish.

15:59.113 --> 16:02.947
With everything that's going on in the world,

16:03.033 --> 16:06.469
maybe she should be with someone like her.

16:07.313 --> 16:10.111
Someone who understands
what she's going through.

16:10.193 --> 16:13.549
But the funny part is it never mattered to me

16:13.633 --> 16:17.182
what she was or where she was from.

16:18.593 --> 16:20.823
- Not to me.
- Logan...

16:20.913 --> 16:22.824
Just treat her right.

16:31.793 --> 16:33.943
It had to come out sooner or later.

16:35.073 --> 16:37.064
Yeah, I guess so.

16:39.073 --> 16:42.668
Don't make her feel any worse
than she already does.

16:52.153 --> 16:55.589
- So you gonna tell me what happened?
- I didn't say anything.

16:57.673 --> 17:00.233
Thanks. Why'd you change your mind?

17:01.793 --> 17:05.422
Cos you were right.
You had to say something.

17:05.512 --> 17:09.631
Only you didn't push him away.
I'm not sure what could.

17:09.713 --> 17:11.704
He let go.

17:12.633 --> 17:15.101
Because he wanted you to be happy.

17:16.633 --> 17:20.865
Don't start crying on me
cos he said I had to take care of you.

17:21.913 --> 17:26.224
What is that? Your bar code's not enough,
you're getting tattoos now?

17:28.673 --> 17:30.789
- Oh, my God.
- What the hell are they?

17:31.513 --> 17:33.504
I don't know.

17:42.873 --> 17:44.511
Huh.

17:44.593 --> 17:47.903
"Huh" as in "Strange,
but I know exactly what it is huh"

17:47.993 --> 17:51.349
- or "Huh, what the hell is going on?"
- Closer to the second one.

17:51.433 --> 17:53.867
They just popped up?
You didn't do anything?

17:53.953 --> 17:57.343
Come into contact with anyone?
Drink anything?

17:57.873 --> 18:01.183
Yeah, I drank from a bottle that said
"Tattoos from within".

18:01.273 --> 18:04.345
- Was that wrong?
- Hey, take it easy.

18:04.433 --> 18:06.663
Sorry, it's just freakin' me out.

18:06.753 --> 18:10.223
They look a little like
the symbol on Joshua's medallion.

18:10.313 --> 18:12.873
Maybe they're like your bar code.

18:12.953 --> 18:15.990
Some sort of genetically encoded imprint

18:16.073 --> 18:18.462
designed to appear on your skin
at a given time.

18:18.593 --> 18:22.791
- What for and why now?
- I don't know. Maybe it's a message.

18:22.913 --> 18:24.904
From who?

18:25.593 --> 18:27.584
Father.

18:29.833 --> 18:34.031
- It's pretty freaky.
- Logan'll figure it out. He always does.

18:35.513 --> 18:38.505
Your donation will help
keep this neighbourhood clean!

18:38.593 --> 18:40.345
Thank you, sir.

18:40.433 --> 18:42.424
Hello? Hey, boss.

18:43.033 --> 18:46.105
One of those freaks
could be dating your daughter.

18:46.313 --> 18:49.271
All right. You better put me
on the clock now. Bye.

18:49.353 --> 18:52.823
- I gotta go for a pick-up in Sector Nine.
- All right.

18:55.593 --> 18:59.302
Those trannie freaks.
They're all over the place, man.

19:13.113 --> 19:15.343
- How we doing?
- Nothing yet.

19:15.433 --> 19:18.709
- Control, this is position 12.
- Got something?

19:20.713 --> 19:22.749
Think so.

19:26.113 --> 19:28.343
Never mind. Just an old lady with the flu.

19:29.433 --> 19:31.503
Roger, position 12.

19:39.673 --> 19:41.664
Wait a minute.

19:41.993 --> 19:43.426
Check it out.

19:43.913 --> 19:47.622
- Copy, position 12. We see him. Stay on him.
- I'll do that.

20:05.353 --> 20:09.028
Listen up, people, you've been made.
All units, converge.

20:09.433 --> 20:11.993
Control, this is position nine.
We're in pursuit.

20:12.073 --> 20:15.668
Copy, position nine. Calling in backup now.

20:17.633 --> 20:19.624
Freeze!

20:23.353 --> 20:25.662
Stop right there! Police!

20:31.913 --> 20:34.347
Move! Move! Move!

20:36.393 --> 20:39.146
Control, this is position nine. We lost him.

20:46.113 --> 20:48.183
That should do the trick.

20:51.193 --> 20:53.184
Wish me luck.

20:54.033 --> 20:56.547
All right! You can come.

21:10.713 --> 21:14.422
Logan says it's some branch
of ancient Minoan language.

21:14.513 --> 21:17.425
- He figure out what it says?
- He's working on it.

21:17.513 --> 21:20.903
The problem is no one's
ever deciphered the whole alphabet.

21:20.993 --> 21:25.350
That doesn't make sense.
If Sandeman is involved with this cult

21:25.433 --> 21:27.901
and he did encode whatever that is into you,

21:27.993 --> 21:31.065
then why did he do it
in a language you can't understand?

21:31.153 --> 21:34.225
Maybe he was gonna teach her before he left.

21:34.313 --> 21:37.828
- Why not just plain English?
- So no one else could read it.

21:38.273 --> 21:40.264
Sort of makes sense.

21:40.353 --> 21:42.583
Are we sure he's one of the good guys?

21:43.473 --> 21:45.748
He left Manticore, didn't he?

21:45.833 --> 21:49.064
- Did he ever tell you why he left?
- No.

21:49.153 --> 21:51.269
But he just left in a hurry.

21:51.353 --> 21:56.029
Hey, all. Say hello
to the newest resident of Terminal City.

21:56.113 --> 21:58.024
CJ, everyone.

21:58.113 --> 22:01.662
- Everyone, this is CJ.
- Hey, CJ.

22:01.753 --> 22:03.584
Welcome.

22:03.673 --> 22:06.471
What are you, X3? X4?

22:07.033 --> 22:10.343
I'm X5-411.

22:10.473 --> 22:12.065
X5?

22:12.633 --> 22:14.988
The few. Proud.

22:16.913 --> 22:19.552
You don't believe me? OK!

22:19.633 --> 22:22.625
You want a little? You want a piece?

22:32.953 --> 22:35.262
Did you see that? The way I blurred?

22:35.753 --> 22:37.311
No.

22:37.393 --> 22:39.384
Exactly. That's cos I'm so fast.

22:42.153 --> 22:44.144
Still don't believe me?

22:58.673 --> 23:00.868
- Where'd you get that?
- Why?

23:04.033 --> 23:05.751
No reason.

23:05.833 --> 23:08.506
- Is that something you've seen before?
- No.

23:09.073 --> 23:12.349
- Guys! Hey, guys!
...identified as a transgenic

23:12.433 --> 23:15.345
- but were unable to apprehend the subject.
- It's Biggs.

23:15.433 --> 23:16.393
If you see this individual,
alert the authorities immediately.

23:16.393 --> 23:18.907
If you see this individual,
alert the authorities immediately.

23:18.993 --> 23:22.190
This alleged transgenic
is considered to be dangerous

23:22.273 --> 23:25.390
and should not be approached
under any circumstances.

23:25.473 --> 23:27.782
It is unclear if the suspect is armed.

23:32.593 --> 23:35.232
You won't believe what just happened to me.

23:35.393 --> 23:37.463
- Where are you?
- Near your place.

23:37.553 --> 23:40.226
The suspected transgenic...

23:40.313 --> 23:42.463
Get back to Terminal City right now, pal.

23:42.553 --> 23:45.147
- Why, what's wrong?
- Excuse me!

23:46.233 --> 23:48.428
Hang on a sec, Alec.

23:48.513 --> 23:49.662
Yeah?

23:49.753 --> 23:53.382
- Wanna help keep the area trannie-safe?
- Some other time.

23:57.873 --> 23:59.864
Hey! He's one of 'em!

24:01.713 --> 24:03.544
How d'you like that, freak?

24:03.633 --> 24:05.112
Biggs?

24:05.193 --> 24:07.184
- He's in trouble.
- Let's go.

24:10.833 --> 24:12.630
Hey, what the hell's going on?

24:12.713 --> 24:16.103
Neighbourhood guys got a hold
of that mutant that was on the news.

24:16.193 --> 24:20.550
- What do you mean "got a hold of'?
- Gave him hell. What do ya think?

24:26.273 --> 24:29.026
That oughta teach them freaks a lesson.

24:42.873 --> 24:45.307
The suspected transgenic met a violent end

24:45.393 --> 24:49.022
when it was confronted by members
of a local neighbourhood watch group.

24:49.113 --> 24:51.422
We take you live to Senator James McKinley,

24:51.513 --> 24:55.347
chairman of the Congressional
Task Force on the transgenic threat.

24:55.433 --> 24:58.311
Obviously I don't condone
this sort of vigilantism.

24:58.393 --> 25:01.590
Though I understand the fear and anger
that drove these people

25:01.673 --> 25:03.664
to take matters into their own hands,

25:03.753 --> 25:07.985
I have to ask you to remember,
these transgenics are dangerous.

25:08.713 --> 25:10.713
- Let the authorities do their job.
- Leave the trannie-killing to the experts.

25:10.713 --> 25:13.546
- Let the authorities do their job.
- Leave the trannie-killing to the experts.

25:13.633 --> 25:15.828
Progress is being made.

25:15.913 --> 25:19.144
A technological breakthrough
helped us identify and capture

25:19.233 --> 25:21.463
three transgenics in the city of Seattle.

25:21.553 --> 25:23.862
We anticipate many more arrests soon.

25:23.953 --> 25:26.911
Where are the captured
transgenics being held?

25:26.993 --> 25:30.349
I'm afraid that information is classified.

25:30.433 --> 25:35.268
They'll be transported to a central
and secure facility within the day.

25:35.353 --> 25:40.063
We are winning the war,
ladies and gentlemen. You have my word.

25:40.153 --> 25:44.351
- Is the public in danger?
- Senator, tell us more about the technology...

25:45.153 --> 25:48.270
Imagine, an old-fashioned lynching.

25:48.353 --> 25:51.231
I hope I didn't sound too disapproving.

25:51.313 --> 25:54.464
So he escaped.
During the Katara ceremony, no less.

25:54.553 --> 25:57.351
Could be bad for us. For you.

25:57.433 --> 26:00.231
- I'll take care of it.
- See that you do.

26:05.233 --> 26:10.307
We'll have more on Senator McKinley's
comments from last night's incident.

26:11.353 --> 26:13.821
Are you still tight with
the arms dealer in Koreatown?

26:13.913 --> 26:15.107
Yeah.

26:15.193 --> 26:17.582
Tell him we need the nastiest stuff he's got.

26:17.673 --> 26:21.507
TK67s, grenade launchers, whatever.
Money's no object.

26:21.593 --> 26:24.346
- Sorta is when you don't got any.
- Then we'll get some.

26:24.433 --> 26:25.752
What's the plan?

26:25.833 --> 26:28.984
Hit his HQ and get the transgenics out
before White ships 'em off.

26:29.073 --> 26:30.188
Sounds good to me.

26:30.273 --> 26:33.345
That "X5" you brought here, where's he from?

26:33.753 --> 26:35.823
Met him outside on the street. Why?

26:35.913 --> 26:40.384
I think he's connected to White's breeding
cult. I wanna know what he was doing here.

26:40.793 --> 26:42.784
I dunno. But...

26:44.953 --> 26:46.944
he left this behind.

27:04.873 --> 27:06.909
Reagan Ronald.

27:06.993 --> 27:10.429
Special Agent Gottleib.
How you doin'? Good to see you.

27:10.513 --> 27:12.902
Wish I could say the same.

27:14.713 --> 27:16.829
- You OK?
- That's the guy.

27:17.673 --> 27:20.585
- What guy?
- The government guy.

27:20.673 --> 27:26.464
He roughed me up when I was covering the
story about the transgenic living in the sewer.

27:26.673 --> 27:31.064
- You recognise this?
- That appears to be a Jam Pony ID badge, sir.

27:31.153 --> 27:35.624
- We found it on the body of a transgenic.
- How do you suppose it got there?

27:38.353 --> 27:43.143
Look. I had no idea he was one of them.
If I had, I never would've hired him.

27:52.233 --> 27:55.509
- How many transgenics are employed here?
- None. That I know of.

27:55.593 --> 27:57.584
That you know of?

27:57.913 --> 28:00.222
Yeah. I mean, how can anybody be sure?

28:00.313 --> 28:03.066
Listen, I gotta tell ya... I hate them.

28:03.153 --> 28:06.270
I loathe them.
Like any God-fearing American should.

28:06.353 --> 28:08.947
Then you'll let us look at your personnel files.

28:09.033 --> 28:12.025
No. That'd be OK, sir. Go ahead.

28:12.113 --> 28:14.104
Take your time.

28:23.113 --> 28:26.105
What'd you just do?
I saw you go into Normal's office.

28:26.193 --> 28:29.549
- There are more transgenics here.
- You're trippin'.

28:34.313 --> 28:37.703
- Why'd you take Max and Alec's files?
- Why do you think?

28:47.353 --> 28:50.789
Hey, George! You found me.

28:50.873 --> 28:54.024
- So did I.
- Why'd you bring her here?

28:54.113 --> 28:56.673
Who are you
and what are you doing in Terminal City?

28:56.753 --> 28:58.709
Same as you. Hiding out.

28:58.793 --> 29:00.784
Why? You're not a transgenic.

29:04.153 --> 29:06.713
- Don't make me slap you around!
- They're after me.

29:06.793 --> 29:08.112
- Who?
- Familiars!

29:08.193 --> 29:10.388
Think I wanna go back to their loony bin?

29:10.473 --> 29:10.753
- Don't look like that. I'm not crazy.
- Right.

29:10.753 --> 29:12.869
- Don't look like that. I'm not crazy.
- Right.

29:12.953 --> 29:16.502
They locked me up because of my dad.
He was part of it all until he got out.

29:16.593 --> 29:19.061
Turned his back on the whole damn thing.

29:19.153 --> 29:22.862
- Why'd he leave the breeding cult?
- Because...

29:25.753 --> 29:31.111
He knew I wouldn't survive
and he didn't want me to die.

29:31.313 --> 29:35.101
You mean the whole initiation thing
with the snake blood?

29:37.233 --> 29:39.349
- How did you know about that?
- Never mind.

29:39.433 --> 29:41.742
How did he know you wouldn't survive?

29:43.073 --> 29:45.871
He was a scientist. This place was his.

29:46.073 --> 29:47.984
He tested my DNA.

29:48.073 --> 29:52.385
But that's not allowed, see.
Everyone has to be initiated, they said.

29:52.473 --> 29:57.945
Thousands of years of tradition, they said.
He said "Screw tradition" and sent me away.

29:58.193 --> 30:00.866
Until they caught you and locked your ass up.

30:05.033 --> 30:07.422
They're everywhere.

30:07.513 --> 30:11.347
You never know who's part of it.

30:11.433 --> 30:15.142
- The initiation thing, what's it for?
- I dunno.

30:15.753 --> 30:19.792
They don't tell you
unless you take it and survive.

30:21.433 --> 30:26.188
My dad wanted to change things
with science and technology

30:26.273 --> 30:28.548
but they said that was heresy.

30:28.633 --> 30:31.705
So your dad got sick
of the whole selective-breeding thing

30:31.793 --> 30:33.784
and decided to get into gene splicing?

30:33.873 --> 30:36.341
He only came here
when the government took over.

30:36.433 --> 30:39.072
- Took over what?
- Hello! Manticore.

30:39.953 --> 30:43.343
- What?
- Who do you think made you?

30:44.513 --> 30:47.073
Sandeman.

30:47.913 --> 30:51.701
- Sandeman's your father?
- Haven't you heard a word I've said?

30:54.313 --> 30:58.101
- Is he alive? Do you know where he is?
- Maybe.

30:58.193 --> 30:59.945
- I gotta find him.
- Why?

31:00.033 --> 31:02.991
Got a lot of questions. Like why he made us.

31:03.073 --> 31:05.382
Why he left. And what are these?

31:07.633 --> 31:09.749
Ancient Minoan.

31:09.833 --> 31:12.791
- Do you know what it says?
- I don't read Minoan.

31:12.873 --> 31:15.262
Why don't you ask whoever drew them?

31:15.353 --> 31:17.548
That's the thing. Nobody "drew them".

31:17.633 --> 31:20.591
- They just popped up.
- That's kinda weird.

31:21.913 --> 31:25.064
I think they're a message from your father.

31:25.273 --> 31:29.789
- What kind of message?
- If you help me find him, I can find out.

31:30.673 --> 31:34.427
- Will you set up a meet?
- I don't know.

31:35.473 --> 31:40.103
Come on! I mean, we're kind of related.

31:43.553 --> 31:48.024
Well, when you put it that way...

31:54.473 --> 31:56.350
Sorry about Biggs.

31:57.593 --> 31:59.709
Yeah.

31:59.793 --> 32:03.069
- Like to have a talk with whoever did that.
- Me too.

32:03.233 --> 32:06.430
There were some guys there,
talking crap about transgenics.

32:06.513 --> 32:08.583
Think it was them?

32:09.073 --> 32:10.950
Wanna go find out?

32:11.273 --> 32:13.070
Donations here, please.

32:13.153 --> 32:15.144
Thank you, sir.

32:15.913 --> 32:17.949
Y'all wanna make a donation?

32:18.033 --> 32:21.423
Yeah, but my friend here
thinks you're running a scam.

32:21.513 --> 32:24.471
- I guess you haven't seen the news.
- What about it?

32:24.553 --> 32:25.873
Who strung the trannie up
on that bridge over there?

32:25.873 --> 32:27.670
Who strung the trannie up
on that bridge over there?

32:30.073 --> 32:32.587
- I've got a problem with that.
- Oh, yeah?

32:33.513 --> 32:35.504
Yeah.

32:40.593 --> 32:42.788
He was a friend of ours.

33:00.953 --> 33:04.309
You and your friends
need to get out of town tonight.

33:04.633 --> 33:07.511
I see you around here again, I'm gonna kill ya.

33:10.873 --> 33:13.182
Let's go, Josh. Come on.

33:13.993 --> 33:15.984
Leave it.

33:30.433 --> 33:35.109
- Where is he?
- Dad drives kinda slow.

33:36.473 --> 33:39.192
Always made our poor mother crazy.

33:46.073 --> 33:48.746
Hello, 452.

33:54.793 --> 33:57.102
My brother.

34:02.433 --> 34:06.062
Poor Sandeman.
One son's a loon, the other's a psychopath.

34:07.273 --> 34:11.710
- Be nice. We're practically family.
- Don't remind me.

34:11.793 --> 34:14.101
I'm not happy about it either.

34:14.193 --> 34:18.152
Did I do the right thing, Ames?
Did I do good?

34:18.233 --> 34:20.224
Yeah, you did real good, CJ.

34:20.313 --> 34:23.748
So you're not gonna send me back there?
To that place?

34:23.833 --> 34:27.143
No, no worries. Nothin' like that, little brother.

34:27.233 --> 34:30.384
If you're wondering about the name,
I changed it.

34:30.793 --> 34:33.353
Sort of a symbolic thing.

34:34.913 --> 34:37.302
White as in unsullied.

34:37.393 --> 34:40.783
Free of my father's betrayal and shame.

34:41.112 --> 34:43.103
What do they say?

34:45.233 --> 34:47.224
Ames, what do they say?

34:48.473 --> 34:50.464
- What do they say, Ames?
- Answer him.

34:50.553 --> 34:55.581
What do you think they say? They say the
same stuff that he was spouting off for years.

34:55.672 --> 34:59.871
How all life is sacred, blah blah blah.
How the meek will inherit the earth...

34:59.953 --> 35:03.343
You know what?
The meek will not inherit the earth.

35:03.433 --> 35:07.267
The strong will take what is theirs
and crush the meek.

35:07.353 --> 35:10.709
After our long wait, our time has come.

35:11.473 --> 35:13.270
Good. Can I go now?

35:13.353 --> 35:16.663
He wanted to destroy our destiny.

35:18.273 --> 35:21.345
5,000 years of planning.

35:22.433 --> 35:24.742
Destroy? How?

35:25.793 --> 35:28.148
By creating her.

35:28.673 --> 35:31.346
She's the one he used to talk about?

35:31.593 --> 35:33.629
Now...

35:33.713 --> 35:36.386
Before I kill you and end this little story,

35:37.753 --> 35:39.630
I have to ask you about my son.

35:39.713 --> 35:42.273
Oh, boy. This changes everything.

35:42.913 --> 35:43.273
- Is he alive?
- No.

35:43.273 --> 35:45.423
- Is he alive?
- No.

35:45.513 --> 35:47.549
Yeah. Well, what was the question?

35:49.433 --> 35:51.663
Made a big mistake.

35:53.313 --> 35:56.783
Is he alive? Answer me.

35:56.873 --> 36:00.149
- But it's not too late.
- Will you shut up?

36:04.913 --> 36:08.826
Sorry, brother. But if what you said is true,
she's the only chance I've got.

36:11.953 --> 36:14.592
Oh, he's gonna be mad.
He's gonna be really mad.

36:14.673 --> 36:17.426
He's got a will to him like you won't believe.

36:20.993 --> 36:24.349
Not that I'm complaining,
but why the change of heart?

36:24.433 --> 36:27.630
Don't you ever listen? You're it, man.

36:28.313 --> 36:31.066
Time's running out. It's coming.

36:31.513 --> 36:33.743
What's coming?

36:33.833 --> 36:35.664
Sir?

36:35.753 --> 36:36.868
Yeah.

36:37.033 --> 36:40.503
Prisoners are ready for transport.

36:40.593 --> 36:43.426
- Five minutes.
- Very good, sir.

36:55.353 --> 36:58.425
- You ready?
- You kidding? I'm sticking with you.

36:58.753 --> 37:00.983
I'll take that as a yes.

37:22.753 --> 37:24.744
CJ, come on!

37:25.433 --> 37:28.072
- Stop!
- Hi! Hold on! Hold on!

37:28.153 --> 37:29.433
I was wrong. Mistakes were made here!

37:29.433 --> 37:31.947
I was wrong. Mistakes were made here!

37:32.033 --> 37:34.866
- Move.
- Come on, bro. It's all good!

37:35.033 --> 37:36.830
I said move!

37:40.313 --> 37:43.703
Go! Go!

38:06.713 --> 38:10.422
- How long have you known?
- About a year.

38:10.513 --> 38:14.392
- Why didn't you tell me?
- What difference would it make?

38:14.473 --> 38:16.862
How can you say that? She's one of them.

38:19.033 --> 38:21.786
She's been a good friend to you.

38:23.033 --> 38:26.742
You gonna believe what you hear on TV
or what's in your heart?

38:27.713 --> 38:30.068
So what if she was made in a lab?

38:30.153 --> 38:32.508
She's the best person you know.

38:38.593 --> 38:43.064
You're right. She is. It's all good.

38:50.953 --> 38:52.784
All right, let's do this.

38:52.873 --> 38:55.182
Let's see what you've got, Igloo.

38:55.273 --> 38:58.106
Salamander Boy trying to be cool?
Come on!

38:58.353 --> 39:00.389
So Sandeman is White's father.

39:00.473 --> 39:03.988
And I guess in some twisted kinda way,
it means he's my brother.

39:05.393 --> 39:09.181
One thing's for sure. If Sandeman
tried to leave the cult, Joshua was right.

39:09.273 --> 39:12.663
- He's one of the good guys.
- So's CJ in his own crazy way.

39:12.753 --> 39:16.462
Whatever Sandeman was telling me
with these things, it freaked White out.

39:16.673 --> 39:20.666
He made it sound like I was the Second
Coming, here to foil his big, evil plan.

39:20.753 --> 39:22.630
Like I even know what it is.

39:22.833 --> 39:24.824
Three, two, one...

39:27.993 --> 39:31.269
Hey, Max. Check it out!
We got a little bet going on over here.

39:31.353 --> 39:34.663
- See who can last the longest. You want in?
- No.

39:38.393 --> 39:41.146
- I'll let you get back to the party.
- Logan.

39:47.793 --> 39:49.784
Take care.

39:57.833 --> 39:59.824
I'm disappointed in you, CJ.

40:01.113 --> 40:03.104
You did a bad thing.

40:03.793 --> 40:05.784
A very bad thing.

40:06.153 --> 40:09.748
You had a chance to redeem yourself,
to redeem our family.

40:10.073 --> 40:13.145
And you threw it away, like garbage.

40:26.153 --> 40:28.587
But I'll find her,

40:28.673 --> 40:30.664
now that I know what she is.

40:33.313 --> 40:35.304
I have to.

41:03.873 --> 41:06.671
