WEBVTT

00:03.337 --> 00:05.965
Whoa!
Total domination!

00:06.173 --> 00:08.892
I am the master of
attic-stuff mini-golf!

00:09.092 --> 00:10.685
From the mighty
Swiss Alps

00:10.886 --> 00:13.230
to the badlands of
Dipper's old laundry

00:13.430 --> 00:15.148
where man
fears to tread.

00:15.349 --> 00:17.101
All right,
let a pro on the field.

00:17.309 --> 00:18.606
Uh, floor. Whatever.

00:19.394 --> 00:20.065
(grunts)

00:24.608 --> 00:25.484
Stan:
Ow! My head!

00:25.692 --> 00:27.535
It hit me
right in the head!

00:27.736 --> 00:29.989
Yes! Stan shot!
Is that legal?

00:30.489 --> 00:31.456
(snorts)

00:31.657 --> 00:33.159
The judges say
it's out of bounds.

00:33.367 --> 00:35.119
- You're out of bounds!
- Hey! Stop it!

00:35.327 --> 00:36.328
(both laughing)

00:38.372 --> 00:41.091
Hey, Dipper, I gotta go hang out
with Candy and Grenda tonight.

00:41.291 --> 00:43.339
Aw, again?
You can't leave mid-game!

00:43.627 --> 00:45.254
Don't be silly,
I'm not leaving!

00:45.504 --> 00:47.552
My friends are
coming to me!

00:47.756 --> 00:48.598
Wait, what?

00:48.840 --> 00:50.137
Oh, no.
No, no, no!

00:50.342 --> 00:52.344
Sleeping bags?
Rom-come?

00:52.803 --> 00:54.555
<i>Calling All Boys</i>
preteen edition?

00:55.013 --> 00:56.185
You're not having a...

00:56.723 --> 00:58.316
both:
Sleepover!

00:58.642 --> 01:00.770
(screaming)

01:01.186 --> 01:02.938
I â™ª

01:41.518 --> 01:43.612
Mabel: Okay, so
how much do you like boys?

01:43.979 --> 01:45.322
So much!

01:45.522 --> 01:47.616
Boys make me
think about kissing.

01:47.816 --> 01:49.864
- Candy, oh my gosh!
- Oh.

01:50.068 --> 01:52.696
We are so
crazy tonight!

01:52.904 --> 01:55.874
(girls shrieking)

01:56.074 --> 01:57.826
(Grenda hitting floor)

02:00.537 --> 02:02.380
Who wants to smear
makeup on my face?

02:02.623 --> 02:05.001
Ugh, you're already
so beautiful, Grenda.

02:05.208 --> 02:06.300
What would be the point?

02:06.501 --> 02:08.469
(chanting while smashing)
Beautiful! Beautiful!

02:08.878 --> 02:09.755
-(chanting and smashing continue)
-(groaning)

02:09.963 --> 02:12.182
Mabel! Do you think you
can do this somewhere else?

02:12.382 --> 02:14.601
You're laughing at frequencies
only clogs should hear!

02:14.801 --> 02:16.724
Come on,
it's not that bad.

02:16.928 --> 02:17.895
You know what
your brother needs?

02:18.138 --> 02:20.266
(gasps)
A makeover?

02:22.225 --> 02:23.522
(Dipper screaming)

02:23.727 --> 02:24.603
(goat bleating)

02:25.896 --> 02:28.866
(sighs) Hey, Soos, can I sleep
in your break room tonight?

02:29.316 --> 02:30.363
Of course, dude.

02:31.443 --> 02:34.037
You've just gotta make your body
go like a video game puzzle block.

02:34.237 --> 02:37.116
Beep-e-do-boop. Boop. Beep.
Beepy-de-boop. Bop-boop. Boop

02:37.491 --> 02:38.913
The trick is to
hold perfectly still.

02:39.117 --> 02:40.289
-(hissing)
- Ow! Wait, wait.

02:40.535 --> 02:41.582
-(hissing)
- Ow! Wait, wait.

02:41.787 --> 02:42.583
-(hissing)
- Ow! Wait, wait.

02:42.871 --> 02:44.339
I think I'll sleep somewhere else.

02:44.539 --> 02:45.210
-(hissing)
- Ow! Ow! Ow!

02:45.415 --> 02:47.042
- Actually felt good that time. Ow! Wait, wait.
-(hissing)

02:48.293 --> 02:50.637
(sighs)
Sleeping under the stars.

02:51.004 --> 02:52.130
Not bad.

02:54.591 --> 02:56.468
(screaming) Get off!
(screaming) Get away!

02:57.511 --> 02:59.263
(shrieking and laughing)

02:59.471 --> 03:00.472
all: You go, girl!

03:02.474 --> 03:03.441
This is still better.

03:08.313 --> 03:10.862
Ugh.
What happened last night?

03:11.316 --> 03:11.987
Whoa!

03:12.484 --> 03:13.701
What's up, party girl?

03:14.361 --> 03:17.615
I don't know what I was kissing
in there, but I have no regrets.

03:17.823 --> 03:19.496
Candy falls down now!
(grunts)

03:21.910 --> 03:24.834
That was awesome, girls.
See you again soon!

03:26.873 --> 03:29.797
Hey, brother. You want any
of this leftover pizza?

03:30.001 --> 03:31.924
It's got glitter on it!

03:32.129 --> 03:34.803
Mabel, last night an owl
tried to eat my tongue.

03:35.006 --> 03:36.349
(chuckles)
That's great.

03:36.550 --> 03:40.305
No, it's not great!
This is impossible to live with!

03:40.512 --> 03:42.981
What? I'm delightful
to live with!

03:43.181 --> 03:46.060
Get ready to be poked
by the fun stick!

03:46.268 --> 03:47.144
_Boop!
_Aah!

03:47.686 --> 03:49.063
Mabel, I've had it
with the fun stick.

03:49.271 --> 03:50.739
You've totally
wrecked our room.

03:51.022 --> 03:53.491
And (gasps) oh no!
Our mini golf course!

03:53.692 --> 03:54.864
(chuckles) Yeah.

03:55.026 --> 03:56.778
Grenda sure loves
breaking things.

03:56.987 --> 03:58.705
Mabel, we need to lay down
some ground rules

03:58.905 --> 04:00.532
if we're going to be
living in this room together.

04:00.782 --> 04:02.500
First of all:
no sleepovers.

04:02.701 --> 04:05.545
What? If I
can't have sleepovers,

04:05.746 --> 04:08.875
then <i>you</i> can't keep me up every night
with your summer reading.

04:09.082 --> 04:11.050
How does reading
keep you up?

04:12.669 --> 04:17.140
(gasps) Oh.
(chuckles) Interesting.

04:17.339 --> 04:20.344
-(pen clicking)
- But who stole the capers?

04:20.552 --> 04:22.429
_(c"cki"9 De n) Tch <i>I</i>
tch <i>I</i> tCh, tch, tch-

04:22.637 --> 04:24.935
Well, at least my braces
don't whistle when I breathe.

04:25.140 --> 04:27.313
At least <i>I</i> wash my clothes
once in a while.

04:27.517 --> 04:30.236
Washing clothes is a waste of time.
I'm a busy guy.

04:30.437 --> 04:31.313
(mocking) Meow, meow,
meow, meow, meow.

04:31.521 --> 04:33.023
All right, if you "meow"
one more time...

04:33.231 --> 04:34.357
(mocking)
Meow, meow, meow!

04:34.566 --> 04:36.318
Okay, that's it!
That's the final straw!

04:36.651 --> 04:38.198
Maybe we shouldn't
share a room any more.

04:38.487 --> 04:40.990
Well... (grunts)
Well, maybe we shouldn't.

04:41.198 --> 04:43.200
- Fine by me.
- Double-fine by me.

04:43.408 --> 04:45.786
Then we need to talk to
Grunkle Stan about moving rooms.

04:45.994 --> 04:47.541
Yeah, he's a reasonable guy.

04:47.746 --> 04:49.965
(grunting)

04:50.165 --> 04:51.508
Fight! Fight! Fight!

04:51.875 --> 04:52.501
(remote control clicking)

04:54.377 --> 04:55.629
Fight! Fight! Fight!

04:55.837 --> 04:56.554
(remote control clicking)

04:58.006 --> 04:59.223
Fight! Fight! Fight!

04:59.716 --> 05:01.218
Fight! Fight! Fight!

05:01.426 --> 05:02.678
Announcer on TV:
<i>Baby</i> Fights!

05:03.261 --> 05:05.013
TV.
It knows what I want.

05:05.472 --> 05:07.645
Grunkle Stan,
we want different rooms.

05:07.849 --> 05:10.193
Ha! And I want
a pair of magic money pants.

05:10.393 --> 05:11.064
It's not gonna happen.

05:11.269 --> 05:12.441
Magic money pants?

05:12.646 --> 05:15.069
Come on, Grunkle Stan. Can't
we work something out?

05:15.273 --> 05:17.446
Look, kid, there's my room
and the attic. That's it.

05:17.651 --> 05:20.700
Whaddya think, there's some kind
of secret, hidden room in the Shack?

05:22.322 --> 05:25.201
Soos: Dudes, I found some kind of
secret, hidden room in the Shack!

05:27.244 --> 05:28.871
Okay, so I was cleaning up
behind this bookcase

05:29.079 --> 05:32.583
when boom! Mystery door!
This old shack is full of weird secrets.

05:35.252 --> 05:37.004
(mouse chittering)

05:38.588 --> 05:41.432
- Whoa!
-(gasps) Classy.

05:42.843 --> 05:44.220
(inhales and blows)

05:44.386 --> 05:45.933
(coughs)

05:48.473 --> 05:50.225
"Experiment seventy-eight."

05:51.226 --> 05:52.728
Grunkle Stan?
What is this place?

05:52.936 --> 05:55.155
I don't know. Just another
room I gotta clean up now.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.574
This carpet is amazing!

05:57.816 --> 05:59.568
Yeah, if you're into
things that are terrible.

06:02.070 --> 06:03.492
Problem solved!
I'll move in here.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.995
What? Why do you
automatically get the room?

06:06.199 --> 06:07.701
We both saw it
at the same time.

06:07.909 --> 06:11.038
Wait a second. So you
both want this room, huh?

06:11.454 --> 06:14.298
I guess I'll give it to whichever
one of you I like more.

06:15.709 --> 06:18.087
Uh-oh.
Looks like my shoe's untied.

06:18.795 --> 06:19.967
-(both struggling)
- Dipper: Give it to me!

06:20.171 --> 06:21.718
(evil laughter)
To the kitchen!

06:22.090 --> 06:23.842
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

06:24.217 --> 06:25.343
-(both panting)
- Soos: Whoa.

06:25.677 --> 06:28.647
I don't know, dudes. This room
gives me major creep-o vibes.

06:28.847 --> 06:30.349
You know, the attic
is a pretty good space.

06:30.557 --> 06:32.355
Maybe you two should
appreciate what you've got.

06:34.102 --> 06:35.854
- I gotta have that room!
- Grunkle Stan!

06:36.605 --> 06:38.357
Huh. Hey, what do I know?

06:38.565 --> 06:40.567
Maybe there's nothing creepy
going on in this room.

06:46.114 --> 06:48.708
-(both grunting)
- Stan: All right kids, here's how it's gonna go down.

06:48.950 --> 06:51.499
Whoever sucks up the hardest
gets the key to the new room.

06:51.703 --> 06:54.673
Grunkle Stan, we're not gonna suck
up to you just to get the new room.

06:54.873 --> 06:57.001
- Yeah we are!
- Ten suck up points for Mabel.

06:57.208 --> 06:59.176
I mean, uh,
yeah we are. (chuckling)

06:59.377 --> 07:01.596
Trying too hard.
Minus 15 suck up points.

07:01.796 --> 07:03.673
- What?!
- Good decision, Grunkle Stan!

07:03.882 --> 07:07.307
Trying way too hard!
Plus 5O suck up points! Ha ha!

07:08.386 --> 07:11.936
Now, who wants to re-tile the roof
in searing a hundred and five degree heat?

07:12.223 --> 07:14.692
- Me, me, me! No, Dipper, give it here!
- Me, me! I'll do it!

07:15.268 --> 07:15.939
(chuckling)

07:16.144 --> 07:18.112
- Ah, Stan, you're a good uncle.
-(kids fighting)

07:18.313 --> 07:19.439
Mabel:
I'll kill you!

07:20.982 --> 07:21.608
(sighs)

07:21.816 --> 07:24.035
Dipper, you're
phoning it in!

07:25.320 --> 07:26.993
(smacks lips) Ah.
Man, that's refreshing.

07:27.238 --> 07:28.785
Ten suck up points
for this lemonade.

07:29.074 --> 07:30.291
(high-pitched voice)
Thank you, Stan.

07:30.492 --> 07:32.540
Ho-ho! Ten more
for politeness.

07:32.744 --> 07:34.712
(slurping)
Oh, and so sweet!

07:35.956 --> 07:36.673
(sighs)

07:37.123 --> 07:39.717
All these chores will be
worth it when I get this room.

07:39.918 --> 07:41.670
Shag carpeting?
Come on.

07:43.713 --> 07:45.636
Hey brother,
don't get too comfortable.

07:45.840 --> 07:48.935
I just made Stan an omelet
shaped like his own face.

07:50.178 --> 07:51.930
I have seen
the face of beauty.

07:52.847 --> 07:55.225
Face it.
I'm like a suck up ninja.

07:55.433 --> 07:56.525
This room's
as good as mine.

07:56.726 --> 07:58.148
You might as well give up now.

07:58.353 --> 08:01.323
- What do you say?
- I say I'm gonna win this room somehow,

08:01.523 --> 08:03.696
and when I do, I'll
finally have my own space

08:03.900 --> 08:06.278
I will never have to share
anything ever again!

08:06.486 --> 08:08.238
Both screaming)

08:10.991 --> 08:13.119
dipper (as Mabel):
Ugh... What happened?

08:14.077 --> 08:16.705
Mabel (as Dipper): Dipper? Why
are you wearing my clothes?

08:17.038 --> 08:18.790
And my...
Face!

08:19.082 --> 08:20.709
Mabel (as Dipper):
Am I in your body?

08:20.917 --> 08:22.419
Dipper (as Mabel):
Am I in your body?

08:23.461 --> 08:27.261
(both screaming)

08:27.841 --> 08:29.559
(vomits and screams)

08:30.093 --> 08:30.969
(Dipper screaming)

08:31.177 --> 08:32.895
(panting, screaming)

08:33.138 --> 08:35.982
Mabel (as Dipper):
Get out! Get out! Get out!

08:36.224 --> 08:38.192
Dipper (as Mabel): This isn't happening.
This isn't happening. This isn't happening.

08:38.393 --> 08:39.895
(Mabel screaming)

08:42.522 --> 08:45.492
Dipper (as Mabel): Great, just what we need.
More Gravity Falls weirdness.

08:45.692 --> 08:46.944
Mabel (as Dipper):
This is stupid!

08:47.193 --> 08:50.743
Sharing a room was bad enough.
Now we're sharing bodies?

08:50.947 --> 08:54.247
Dipper (as Mabel): Ugh, braces are
horrible. It's like my mouth hates me!

08:54.534 --> 08:56.127
And what are these things?

08:56.327 --> 08:59.171
Mabel (as Dipper): I wanna know
why you're so sweaty! And awkward.

08:59.372 --> 09:01.921
Dipper (as Mabel):
Hey, look! Experiment seventy-eight!

09:03.043 --> 09:06.013
"Electron Carpet."
Atoms can swap electrons.

09:06.254 --> 09:10.259
This carpet must build up a static charge
so powerful it can swap minds.

09:10.467 --> 09:13.346
It was the static electricity. Maybe,
we could use it to switch back!

09:13.678 --> 09:16.181
Mabel (as Dipper):
Phew. (chuckles) Glad I'm switching back.

09:16.347 --> 09:19.897
(chuckles) If I was you,
I would totally lose the contest.

09:20.101 --> 09:25.232
Dipper (as Mabel): And if I was you,
which I am, I could sabotage myself!

09:25.440 --> 09:27.863
Then Mabel would lose all her points
and the room would go to Dipper!

09:28.068 --> 09:28.944
Mabel (as Dipper):
Wait, what?

09:29.152 --> 09:33.328
Dipper (as Mabel): Oh, Stan!
I've always hated you! (laughs)

09:33.531 --> 09:34.953
See who he gives
the room to now!

09:35.158 --> 09:38.332
Mabel (as Dipper): No! Wait!
(grunts) Tie your shoes!

09:38.787 --> 09:42.132
Mm. Those cannibals are onto
something, I taste delicious!

09:42.499 --> 09:43.125
Dipper (as Mabel):
Grunkle Stan!

09:43.333 --> 09:44.175
What's the word, Mabel?

09:44.375 --> 09:46.753
Dipper (as Mabel):
That's right! It's me, (grunts) Mabel!

09:46.961 --> 09:51.182
If you like that omelet, you'll love this:
a sandwich made out of rocks!

09:51.549 --> 09:52.516
Candy rocks?

09:53.009 --> 09:54.477
Dipper (as Mabel):
Regular rocks!

09:55.428 --> 09:57.806
Keep that up, and I'll be
giving your brother this key.

09:58.014 --> 10:00.108
Dipper (as Mabel):
(laughs) I mean, darn.

10:00.308 --> 10:03.152
Mabel (as Dipper): Hey, Grunkle Stan!
Your face looks like a butt!

10:03.353 --> 10:05.401
- What?
- Mabel (as Dipper): Breaking stuff is so much fun!

10:05.605 --> 10:07.403
I am Dipper and I stink!

10:08.149 --> 10:12.404
Dipper (as Mabel): Mabel's gone
bananas! Bing! Zow! Balow! (laughing)

10:12.612 --> 10:14.034
Well! This is getting weird.

10:14.823 --> 10:16.416
Dipper (as Mabel): Wait! Are you gonna
dock Mabel points?

10:16.616 --> 10:18.334
Mabel (as Dipper): Dipper should
lose all his points! Ah!

10:18.576 --> 10:19.452
Dipper (as Mabel):
Grunkle Stan!

10:19.828 --> 10:21.580
(grunting)

10:22.664 --> 10:25.087
Waddles, you got it good, bro.
You got no worries.

10:25.291 --> 10:28.670
I mean, nobody thinks it's cute
when I lie naked on the living room floor.

10:29.003 --> 10:30.220
I wish I could be a pig.

10:32.674 --> 10:33.641
(Soos yelPS)

10:36.845 --> 10:39.189
Soos (as Waddles): Yes! I should
do out loud wishing more often.

10:39.389 --> 10:41.733
(sniffs)
Is that a corn cob I spy?

10:42.767 --> 10:44.110
(grunts)
I got little legs!

10:45.562 --> 10:47.314
Waddles (as Soos):
(snorts)

10:48.648 --> 10:49.490
(squeals)

10:57.073 --> 10:58.290
(slurps)

11:04.372 --> 11:06.124
Hey, Soos, what's up?
Have you seen my--

11:11.212 --> 11:12.964
Uh, I'll come back later.

11:13.464 --> 11:16.434
Dipper (as Mabel): Grunkle Stan,
come back! I have more terrible things to do!

11:16.634 --> 11:18.807
You're toast, Mabel!
That room's as good as mine!

11:19.012 --> 11:19.888
(pants, grunts)

11:20.096 --> 11:20.767
There you are, Mabel!

11:20.972 --> 11:21.894
Attack her with love!

11:22.098 --> 11:22.815
Yeah!

11:23.016 --> 11:24.814
Candy and Grenda:
Sleepover!

11:25.018 --> 11:26.986
Dipper (as Mabel): What?
No! No, no, no! (screams)

11:27.187 --> 11:30.487
Mabel (as Dipper): Dipper?
Hey, wait! Wait, come back!

11:31.608 --> 11:35.238
Hey! Uh, could I talk to my,
um, sister for a sec?

11:35.445 --> 11:38.449
This is a sleepover, buddy.
No boys allowed!

11:39.908 --> 11:41.125
(Candy and Grenda laughing)

11:41.326 --> 11:44.671
Dipper (as Mabel): Look, guys, I'm not
really in a sleepover mood right now.

11:44.871 --> 11:47.590
One of my irrational girl
mood swings, you know?

11:47.790 --> 11:48.882
Right? Don't we have those?

11:49.083 --> 11:51.962
Come on! My mom's
age-inappropriate romance novels

11:52.170 --> 11:54.264
<i>aren't going to
read themsewes! Whoa-hoe!</i>

11:54.547 --> 11:56.345
"Wolf man Bare Chest."

11:56.716 --> 11:57.888
Mabel (as Dipper):
Ooh.

11:58.092 --> 11:59.435
Dipper (as Mabel): (nervous chuckle)
Really, I should probably, uh-- (gasps)

11:59.636 --> 12:01.388
Come on! You know
you love it!

12:01.804 --> 12:05.183
"My name is Gerard. I am a
werewolf, creature of the night,

12:05.391 --> 12:07.189
but I am also a creature of passion."

12:07.393 --> 12:08.360
(laughing)

12:08.561 --> 12:09.278
(nervous grunt)

12:09.479 --> 12:11.231
Mabel (as Dipper):
Gerard is just so fierce.

12:11.439 --> 12:12.361
What's going on, Dipper?

12:12.774 --> 12:13.616
(gasps)

12:14.067 --> 12:17.287
Ah. You're at that creepy age
where you spy on girls, huh?

12:17.487 --> 12:19.535
Guess it's time we had
a man-to-man talk

12:19.739 --> 12:21.116
about the birds
and the bees, you know.

12:24.285 --> 12:25.377
Mabel (as Dipper):
(stutters) I, I should really be goi--

12:25.578 --> 12:26.454
No way out of it!

12:26.704 --> 12:30.254
Look, it all begins with this
little fella, the pituitary gland.

12:30.458 --> 12:33.632
He may be little,
but he has big plans.

12:33.836 --> 12:35.088
(screaming)

12:37.382 --> 12:39.976
Soos (as Waddles): I wonder what
rollicking adventures I'll stumble into.

12:41.135 --> 12:44.514
A mud puddle! Do I dare
live out the clichÃ©?

12:45.682 --> 12:46.308
(laughing)

12:46.516 --> 12:48.393
McGucket, McGucket,
McGucket! Wow!

12:48.601 --> 12:51.445
Soos (as Waddles): (laughs) I'm a pig!
Oink, oink, right? (chuckles)

12:51.646 --> 12:52.818
Free meal!

12:53.731 --> 12:56.325
Soos (as Waddles): No! Don't eat me!
I'm a man trapped in a pig's body!

12:56.567 --> 12:58.319
That's what they all say!

12:59.279 --> 13:02.203
Soos (as Waddles):
(huffs and puffs) Help! Police!

13:02.448 --> 13:05.247
(gasps) A bearded witch
chasing a talking pig!

13:05.868 --> 13:07.711
My horoscope came true.

13:07.912 --> 13:08.959
Now read mine!

13:09.163 --> 13:10.585
- What are you? Gemini?
- You knew?

13:10.790 --> 13:11.837
Yeah, of course, I knew!

13:12.583 --> 13:14.631
And now you know
where babies come from.

13:15.420 --> 13:16.797
Mabel (as Dipper):
Goodbye, childhood.

13:17.171 --> 13:19.549
You know, I find you
more likable today than usual.

13:19.757 --> 13:21.475
Maybe you could still win
that game after all.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.895
- Mabel (as Dipper): Huh? -I was gonna
give that new room to Mabel--

13:24.095 --> 13:25.972
Mabel (as Dipper): No, you should!
Give it to Mabel!

13:26.180 --> 13:27.602
You big jerk!

13:28.266 --> 13:29.518
What did you say to me?

13:29.726 --> 13:32.070
Mabel (as Dipper):
I said, uh, shut up, old man!

13:32.270 --> 13:35.240
You're fat and dumb, and
you're a dummy, and take that!

13:37.525 --> 13:39.448
Finally standing up to me, huh?

13:40.111 --> 13:41.613
(laughs)
I love it!

13:41.821 --> 13:45.746
You know, I've made up my mind.
The room belongs to you, Dipper.

13:45.950 --> 13:47.873
Mabel (as Dipper): You can't!
You have to give it to Mabel!

13:48.077 --> 13:51.297
Shh. You had me at
"shut up, old man."

13:51.497 --> 13:53.545
Mabel (as Di No! ppel'):

13:53.833 --> 13:54.800
The end.

13:55.251 --> 13:55.877
Dipper (as Mabel):
Phew.

13:56.085 --> 13:57.632
Grenda: Now for
the thirty-eight sequels!

13:57.920 --> 14:00.014
dipper
No! e'):

14:00.298 --> 14:02.266
'm gonna make you into bacon!

14:02.467 --> 14:04.561
Soos (as Waddles): (chuckles)
That sounds pretty good. Wait, I mean,

14:04.761 --> 14:06.809
"O!

14:09.140 --> 14:13.816
Three, four, five. It's him!
My dream date!

14:14.020 --> 14:14.691
Hello?

14:14.896 --> 14:19.026
Hello, baby, this is Kevin.
My beach house has room for two.

14:19.442 --> 14:21.069
Kevin has the voice of a robot.

14:21.277 --> 14:24.747
Don't ruin this for me, Candy!
It's your turn, Mabel.

14:25.740 --> 14:27.367
(panting)

14:27.575 --> 14:28.827
Dipper (as Mabel):
I gotta win the room.

14:29.369 --> 14:32.589
Stan! It's me, Mabel!
I'm doing things you hate!

14:33.414 --> 14:34.165
(grunts)

14:36.793 --> 14:40.263
Mabel (as Dipper): (sighs) It's over,
Dipper. Stan gave you the room.

14:40.630 --> 14:43.008
Dipper (as Mabel):
(laughs) Yes! All right!

14:44.050 --> 14:48.351
(clearing throat) Well, let's switch
bodies then, and I can start moving in!

14:48.554 --> 14:52.479
Mabel (as Dipper): Wait a minute. You can't
have the room, if you can never get in!

14:53.059 --> 14:54.060
Dipper (as Mabel):
Hey, come back!

14:54.602 --> 14:55.945
(grunting, panting)

14:56.646 --> 14:58.614
dipper (as Mabel):
Come on! (grunts)

14:58.815 --> 15:01.568
Open the door, Dipper!
I mean, Mabel.

15:02.735 --> 15:05.329
(sighs) How am I ever
gonna get in there?

15:06.697 --> 15:07.368
Hmm.

15:07.657 --> 15:10.786
Kevin, for the last time,
I am not interested!

15:11.119 --> 15:12.496
How could you
say that to Kevin?

15:12.745 --> 15:14.418
Dipper (as Mabel);
Hey, girls!

15:14.622 --> 15:17.341
Who wants to give
my brother a makeover?

15:18.042 --> 15:18.759
(gasps)

15:35.476 --> 15:38.855
Oh, good, Soos.
You got a second?

15:40.064 --> 15:43.534
Look, times are tough, uh,
economy or something, etcetera.

15:43.734 --> 15:45.907
Basically, I have to
cut your pay.

15:49.407 --> 15:50.624
Wh-what are you doing?

15:51.284 --> 15:53.036
(snorts)

15:53.786 --> 15:56.585
Is this some sort of negotiating tactic?
'Cause it's not gonna work!

15:59.208 --> 15:59.879
(growls)

16:00.084 --> 16:03.429
Fine! I was lying! I'll give you a
raise! Just never do that again.

16:03.629 --> 16:04.755
Ugh! Nightmare!

16:06.382 --> 16:08.555
Can you help me?
I'm looking for directions.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.943
Oh, you'll show me the way?
Such a gentleman!

16:17.143 --> 16:18.144
(panting)

16:20.313 --> 16:21.860
Candy and Grenda:
It's Candy and Grenda!

16:22.064 --> 16:23.031
Mabel (as Dipper):
Friends!

16:23.733 --> 16:25.360
Hey, guys! What's up?

16:26.235 --> 16:27.987
Dipper? W-wait!
Don't let him in here!

16:28.196 --> 16:29.914
- Makeover!
- Mabel (as Dipper): No, no, no! Stop! Stop!

16:30.114 --> 16:31.115
Whoa! Whoa! No!

16:31.324 --> 16:33.076
We're gonna make you
so hot!

16:33.326 --> 16:38.082
Mabel (as Dipper):Wait, no! Stop!
Guys, you have to listen to me! No!

16:38.748 --> 16:43.800
Dipper (as Mabel): Good job, ladies!
Now, let me just add one final touch!

16:47.381 --> 16:48.132
Ooh, uh.

16:48.341 --> 16:51.936
Ah. My body! I'm a genius!
(chuckles)

16:52.136 --> 16:54.730
Ugh. All right, Mabel,
the room is mine.

16:54.931 --> 16:56.729
Wait, hold on here.
What just happened?

16:56.933 --> 16:59.061
Ugh. I barely understand it.

16:59.268 --> 17:01.896
All I know is if you shuffle
your feet on this carpet,

17:02.104 --> 17:04.071
you can switch
bodies or whatever.

17:06.317 --> 17:07.739
'Zip-zip!
'No!

17:10.530 --> 17:12.281
Dipper (as Candy):
Aw, come on!

17:12.740 --> 17:13.832
Candy (as Dipper):
I am a boy now!

17:14.032 --> 17:16.377
(deep voice) What's up, bro?
Lets grow some moustaches!

17:16.577 --> 17:18.329
Dipper, give me
that key back!

17:18.538 --> 17:19.209
(grunting)

17:19.413 --> 17:20.790
Guys! Stop fighting!

17:22.500 --> 17:25.720
Dipper (as Grenda): Oh, no! Then again,
I like having muscles for once.

17:25.920 --> 17:28.263
Grenda (as Mabel): Wow! Now
I have tiny little doll hands!

17:28.548 --> 17:32.394
Mabel (as Candy): Everybody, look.
Swap back in three, two...

17:32.593 --> 17:35.847
- Soos (as Waddles): Oh, dude!
- Come back! I wanna deep fry your ears!

17:36.472 --> 17:37.724
Dipper (as Grenda):
No! Give me my body back!

17:37.932 --> 17:40.685
(indistinct yelling)

17:40.977 --> 17:42.570
TV announcer:
Tonight on Baby Fights!

17:42.770 --> 17:46.115
Tensions rise between Madison
and Avery at Baby <i>Fight</i> headquarters.

17:49.193 --> 17:50.661
- Mabel (as Candy): Give me my body back!
- Candy (as Dipper): I want my body!

17:50.861 --> 17:51.612
(grunts)

17:54.824 --> 17:56.371
Grenda (as Old Man McGucket):
Cool! I'm Santa Claus!

17:56.659 --> 17:59.503
Old Man McGucket (as Candy):
Whoo-ee! (laughs) I've regained my innocence!

17:59.829 --> 18:03.083
Dipper (as Waddles): (sighs) Well,
I guess I'm a pig now. So that's a thing.

18:03.874 --> 18:04.966
(chomping)

18:05.167 --> 18:06.919
Soos (as Grenda):This body's
not that different from my old one.

18:07.378 --> 18:09.426
We got some reports
of excessive giggling.

18:09.630 --> 18:12.383
(giggling)

18:12.592 --> 18:14.811
Blubs (as Old Man McGucket): My horoscope
didn't say anything about this!

18:15.011 --> 18:20.233
Durland (as Dipper): (yelps) What's
happening to me? Ow! Ow! (laughing)

18:20.683 --> 18:23.152
Candy (as Blubs):
I am a police officer now! (giggles)

18:23.352 --> 18:24.945
Grenda (as Durland):
Let's go get some perps, Candy!

18:25.146 --> 18:26.693
- Dipper (as Waddles): Give me that key, Mabel!
- Never!

18:26.897 --> 18:28.649
(indistinct yelling)

18:35.072 --> 18:36.369
Mabel, are you you?

18:36.741 --> 18:38.288
Yeah, I'm me.

18:38.576 --> 18:39.623
Well, I've got the key!

18:40.578 --> 18:42.330
(huffing and puffing)

18:45.708 --> 18:48.177
Mabel! The room's mine!
Give it to me!

18:48.377 --> 18:50.095
(fighting, grunting)

18:50.546 --> 18:53.049
What's with you? Why do you
need that room so bad?

18:53.257 --> 18:55.134
I never even wanted to move out!

18:55.343 --> 18:56.219
Me either!

18:56.427 --> 18:58.771
Wait, what? Say that again.

18:58.971 --> 19:01.724
I-- I never wanted to move out.

19:01.932 --> 19:03.684
Then what was all this?

19:04.727 --> 19:07.731
Everything was fine until you started bringing
your friends around every night.

19:07.938 --> 19:10.282
I mean, hanging out with you
this summer has been fun.

19:10.483 --> 19:16.206
But-- now, you're always with Candy and Grenda.
And I'm, like, just left behind.

19:16.656 --> 19:18.704
(clicks tongue)
Aw, Dipper...

19:19.116 --> 19:21.369
It's okay. I've just been
having a hard time.

19:21.577 --> 19:23.045
You wouldn't understand
what I'm going through.

19:23.245 --> 19:26.795
You're probably feeling
awkward and sweaty, huh?

19:27.375 --> 19:29.127
Yeah. How did you know?

19:29.543 --> 19:31.671
Here. I won't fight you for it.

19:33.214 --> 19:34.010
Thanks.

19:36.634 --> 19:38.887
Well, it looks like
everyone's back to normal!

19:39.095 --> 19:40.017
(gasping, breathing)

19:40.221 --> 19:43.441
Except for Soos, who may
be a pig permanently?

19:43.641 --> 19:44.984
(chomping)

19:45.184 --> 19:47.687
Oh, no, I changed back.
At least, I think I did.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.397
I'll still eat ya.

19:49.605 --> 19:50.902
Okay, pal, that's enough
of that. Move it along.

19:51.107 --> 19:52.233
Mabel: Move it along,
weird old man.

19:52.441 --> 19:53.533
(snorting)

19:53.734 --> 19:56.112
Huh, I guess being a pig
wasn't that great after all.

19:56.445 --> 19:58.243
Hey, let me get that spot
you can never reach.

19:58.447 --> 19:59.073
(snorts)

20:00.741 --> 20:04.962
Hey, I've been thinking, and
the answer is yes! I will marry you!

20:05.162 --> 20:06.505
Wait, (stutters) I don't
remember anything about a--

20:08.624 --> 20:09.466
(through closed mouth)
Oh, all right.

20:10.167 --> 20:13.091
(grunts and sighs)
Ah. There.

20:13.295 --> 20:16.390
Ah, a man in his own space.
(sips)

20:16.632 --> 20:18.134
That's right! Finally.

20:18.426 --> 20:20.178
So what are you gonna do
with this old thing?

20:20.553 --> 20:21.395
Get rid of it.

20:21.595 --> 20:25.771
(chuckles) You got it.
Yeesh, this carpet's ugly.

20:27.601 --> 20:31.526
Ah. Finally, my own room.
Good night, Mabel.

20:37.653 --> 20:38.779
Good night, Dipper.

20:48.873 --> 20:51.092
Hey, um, do you wanna
have a sleepover?

20:54.170 --> 20:54.921
Fore!

20:56.088 --> 20:57.260
(laughs)

20:59.925 --> 21:02.428
Stan: (yells)
Why am I even out here at night?

21:02.636 --> 21:03.558
(laughing)

21:03.846 --> 21:05.814
So, what are we gonna do
with that new room?

21:06.432 --> 21:09.311
I gave it to Soos to replace
that horrible break room he has.

21:09.727 --> 21:11.855
Hey, do you know what
the deal was with that lady?

21:13.564 --> 21:15.692
(crying) I just don't think
I can do this anymore.

21:15.941 --> 21:17.784
You just seem so different.

21:17.985 --> 21:19.737
(crying)

21:20.029 --> 21:21.781
Look, dude, uh, I'm playing
a little bit of catch up here.

21:21.947 --> 21:23.540
I was in a pig's body for most of the day.

21:23.699 --> 21:24.951
(stutters) What's going on?

21:27.745 --> 21:29.668
Can we kiss again?
Is, is that an option?

21:32.416 --> 21:33.258
Ow! Wait, wait.
