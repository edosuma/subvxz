FEBRUARY 2020

00:18.480 --> 00:21.760
MANIACI'S DEFENSE STRATEGY MEETING
WITH A VIDEO EXPERT

00:25.400 --> 00:28.360
I've compared the full video
to the one given to the media.

00:32.200 --> 00:33.680
Look what happens here.

00:36.560 --> 00:38.680
In the full video, there's a third person.

00:43.440 --> 00:46.760
-Who was that, Pino?
-It looks like Gioacchino Polizzi.

00:47.640 --> 00:48.640
Gioacchino Polizzi?

00:52.680 --> 00:54.960
In this one,
you hear Mr. Maniaci say…

00:55.480 --> 00:57.840
The Prefect has a dossier on you.

00:57.920 --> 00:58.800
…that sentence.

01:00.240 --> 01:02.760
It was added to the video,
it's not there.

01:06.200 --> 01:08.560
So they dubbed it
onto a different clip.

01:10.080 --> 01:13.960
The video released to the media
and the full video, are totally different.

01:18.840 --> 01:21.960
In Sicily, we say "farfantaria,"
bullshit. You know what I mean?

01:23.760 --> 01:25.400
Who the fuck can we trust?

01:27.640 --> 01:29.200
A NETFLIX DOCUMENTARY SERIES

02:05.840 --> 02:06.840
Sicily

02:07.360 --> 02:09.400
is the land of light.

02:18.880 --> 02:21.720
But there's also a lot of darkness.

02:24.120 --> 02:25.280
There are shadows.

02:31.520 --> 02:37.520
And hatred, danger, accusations, and traps
are hiding in those shadows.

02:38.480 --> 02:40.400
Because it's a land of great passion,

02:42.320 --> 02:44.600
positive and negative.

02:48.200 --> 02:51.440
It's not easy to predict
how the trial will end for Maniaci.

02:53.040 --> 02:55.120
I think that the verdict should be drawn

02:55.200 --> 02:57.000
from the investigations,

02:57.080 --> 02:59.520
PINO MANIACI'S LAWYER

02:59.600 --> 03:02.040
from the witness statements that we heard,

03:02.120 --> 03:04.120
and the evidence that was gathered.

03:05.720 --> 03:07.800
Pino Maniaci should be acquitted.

03:09.360 --> 03:13.200
FEBRUARY 2020

03:14.320 --> 03:16.280
MANIACI TRIAL

03:16.360 --> 03:19.120
DEFENSE'S VIDEO EXPERT TESTIMONY

03:21.240 --> 03:24.080
So, you were able to watch
this video that was submitted

03:24.160 --> 03:26.360
as part of
the public prosecutor's evidence.

03:26.880 --> 03:27.720
Yes.

03:30.560 --> 03:34.840
And you compared it with the one
that was broadcast through various media.

03:34.920 --> 03:36.440
Yes, it's also on YouTube.

03:37.520 --> 03:39.840
Can you explain
this discrepancy you noticed?

03:42.760 --> 03:48.000
The discrepancy… is that we see
something is said in the full-length video

03:48.680 --> 03:51.080
when there are three people in the room.

03:53.120 --> 03:57.480
In the video provided to the media,
there are only two people in the frame.

03:59.880 --> 04:02.880
If I understand correctly,
you are saying that it was edited,

04:02.960 --> 04:05.320
that the sound was edited
separately to the video,

04:05.400 --> 04:07.960
so it no longer
corresponds to the original version.

04:08.560 --> 04:10.320
Yes, that's the discrepancy.

04:10.400 --> 04:14.680
So, in the video, the one distributed
by the Carabinieri,

04:14.760 --> 04:17.640
where the so-called
alleged extortion happens

04:17.720 --> 04:21.960
between Maniaci and the mayor,
you're saying that in reality,

04:22.040 --> 04:25.280
there could also be a third person there,
who isn't in the video.

04:25.360 --> 04:26.680
Exactly.

04:30.640 --> 04:34.640
Surely, if there is evidence
of tampering with the video,

04:35.120 --> 04:40.200
it would prove… prove there was
a conspiracy against Pino Maniaci.

04:41.880 --> 04:46.560
A video like that has only one aim,
and that is to shut down,

04:47.320 --> 04:49.240
to quote Pino's infamous wiretaps,

04:49.960 --> 04:51.960
"Shut down Pino Maniaci's inquiries,

04:52.520 --> 04:54.720
and take Telejato off the air."

05:04.960 --> 05:06.240
We want to focus

05:07.400 --> 05:08.280
all our attention

05:08.360 --> 05:10.640
on the illegal accumulation of wealth

05:11.560 --> 05:14.520
because the Mafia
wants to accumulate wealth illegally.

05:14.640 --> 05:16.480
That's the goal of their operation,

05:16.560 --> 05:20.440
so that's the activity
that we have to shine a spotlight on.

05:21.480 --> 05:22.640
Hi, Monica.

05:24.280 --> 05:26.200
I was the leading authority

05:26.280 --> 05:28.240
on preventive measures in Italy.

05:30.480 --> 05:32.200
Thank you. I needed that.

05:34.320 --> 05:37.320
It's not a witch hunt anymore.
It's a conspiracy.

05:39.280 --> 05:43.280
Of course Pino Maniaci didn't orchestrate
all this. Someone used him.

05:44.080 --> 05:47.720
Let's talk about the seized assets,
and clearly, we're here…

05:48.560 --> 05:50.360
Who did it? I don't know.

05:54.280 --> 05:57.000
But I can tell you
it was an orchestrated plan

05:57.080 --> 06:00.240
to put an end to the work
of the preventive measures department.

06:01.960 --> 06:02.840
It's true.

06:04.720 --> 06:07.280
I dare to hope
that I'll be acquitted of everything

06:09.480 --> 06:11.880
because I haven't done anything wrong.

06:15.640 --> 06:17.880
I've spent my whole life
fighting the Mafia,

06:18.960 --> 06:20.760
the sentences that I gave out,

06:20.840 --> 06:22.560
the trials that I presided over,

06:24.000 --> 06:25.200
nobody can ever say

06:26.120 --> 06:28.960
even with the accusations
I'm on trial for,

06:29.520 --> 06:31.640
that I have ever tried to help the Mafia.

06:35.960 --> 06:39.200
SILVANA SAGUTO'S FATHER,
HER HUSBAND LORENZO CARAMMA

06:39.280 --> 06:42.840
AND HER SON EMANUELE
ARE CO-DEFENDANTS IN HER TRIAL

06:42.920 --> 06:45.400
THEY ARE ALL AWAITING THE VERDICT

06:47.880 --> 06:50.440
We have to support each other.
That's all.

06:54.960 --> 06:56.640
Because we all know each other.

06:59.240 --> 07:01.920
And we all know
what we've all done and haven't done.

07:03.080 --> 07:06.680
Being treated like this
leaves you confused and very, very sad.

07:14.400 --> 07:18.080
Last time I spoke to him, my son said,
"You made our lives impossible

07:18.160 --> 07:22.200
chasing an ideal that doesn't exist
because only you believe in it.

07:22.280 --> 07:24.680
No one else did,
and they didn't believe in you."

07:27.360 --> 07:29.600
Our lives were nothing
like other people's.

07:35.320 --> 07:38.640
I made them live in fear,
it wasn't right for kids of that age.

07:39.160 --> 07:40.320
In the end,

07:40.400 --> 07:41.800
it wasn't worth it.

07:44.840 --> 07:48.640
SAGUTO TRIAL
VERDICT

07:50.840 --> 07:52.240
So, the long wait

07:52.320 --> 07:55.280
for the verdict from
the presiding Judge Andrea Catalano,

07:55.360 --> 07:58.800
here at the bunker courtroom
of Caltanissetta, begins.

07:58.880 --> 08:02.280
Prominent defendant, former judge
Silvana Saguto, won't be present…

08:09.200 --> 08:12.640
OCTOBER 2020

08:16.480 --> 08:19.600
I'm waiting calmly for the verdict,
with a lot of faith.

08:22.600 --> 08:25.160
We showed
that the magic circle didn't exist.

08:25.720 --> 08:26.880
SILVANA SAGUTO'S LAWYER

08:26.960 --> 08:29.520
I'm confident
we've done everything possible

08:30.240 --> 08:34.520
to show the inconsistencies
and lack of substance of the claims.

08:58.720 --> 09:00.840
It's a matter
of minutes, Lorenzo.

09:14.640 --> 09:16.760
I didn't go,
I don't want to stand

09:16.840 --> 09:18.920
and wait while the court decides my fate.

09:21.560 --> 09:24.880
What happens, happens,
whether I'm there or not won't change it.

09:29.400 --> 09:31.520
I'd rather not think or talk about it.

09:34.560 --> 09:36.600
We'll see what happens soon enough.

09:37.960 --> 09:38.920
Phone is there,

09:41.320 --> 09:46.440
and if Emanuele texts me,
it will be to… to give me some news.

10:10.840 --> 10:14.280
ALL ARE EQUAL BEFORE THE LAW

10:25.320 --> 10:26.200
What?

10:28.120 --> 10:29.000
Is it out?

10:30.840 --> 10:31.680
What?

10:34.200 --> 10:35.200
The verdict?

10:36.480 --> 10:37.520
And what is it?

10:44.520 --> 10:45.440
Conviction?

10:47.440 --> 10:48.280
Yes?

10:51.520 --> 10:55.320
"In the name of the Italian people,
the Court of Caltanissetta

10:55.400 --> 10:57.000
finds Silvana Saguto

10:57.640 --> 10:59.320
guilty of the charges,

11:02.240 --> 11:05.880
and sentences her to eight years,
six months in prison."

11:09.400 --> 11:11.600
"Sentenced to eight years and six months."

11:22.680 --> 11:25.080
"Lorenzo Caramma, guilty of charges,

11:25.160 --> 11:29.040
and sentenced to six years,
two months and ten days in prison.

11:30.480 --> 11:34.760
Gaetano Cappellano Seminara,
seven years, six months in prison."

11:38.320 --> 11:40.720
So basically, they convicted everyone.

11:43.160 --> 11:46.520
The verdict can't be final.
There's no proof. It's not possible.

11:48.080 --> 11:49.200
Reina's talking.

11:54.280 --> 11:55.120
Hello?

11:55.960 --> 11:58.520
Mama, everyone's convicted, except Papa.

12:00.320 --> 12:03.200
Everyone convicted, I said.
Everyone convicted.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.760
Emanuele's sentenced to six months.

12:08.960 --> 12:11.560
Mama, listen,
if you talk nonsense… I'll hang up.

12:12.440 --> 12:15.920
I already said… I said,
there's nothing more to tell you. Bye.

12:18.360 --> 12:20.440
I think they've seized our house.

12:22.400 --> 12:24.640
I don't have any money,
so I can't pay them.

12:25.360 --> 12:27.320
I don't understand what they're saying.

12:27.400 --> 12:30.000
SILVANA SAGUTO IS ORDERED TO PAY

12:30.080 --> 12:33.640
THE RELEVANT PARTIES
A TOTAL OF OVER 850,000 EUROS

12:35.760 --> 12:38.520
I already told you
I'm not interested in public opinion.

12:41.480 --> 12:45.160
If I'd been acquitted, people would say
there was some secret deal.

12:47.680 --> 12:49.480
Do you realize how insane this is?

12:52.840 --> 12:54.960
The Court of Caltanissetta has sentenced

12:55.040 --> 12:58.600
the former president of the preventive
measures department of Palermo court.

12:58.680 --> 13:01.040
SILVANA SAGUTO
WAS FOUND GUILTY OF CORRUPTION,

13:01.120 --> 13:02.960
ABUSE OF POWER
AND FORGERY OF PUBLIC DOCUMENTS

13:03.040 --> 13:06.120
SHE WAS ACQUITTED OF THE ACCUSATIONS
OF CRIMINAL ASSOCIATION AND EMBEZZLEMENT

13:29.200 --> 13:32.680
NEWSROOM

13:33.360 --> 13:37.160
What do you think? What do you think?
What do you think?

13:37.680 --> 13:40.360
What do you think
of Saguto's sentence, huh?

13:41.600 --> 13:42.600
Fuck!

13:44.520 --> 13:46.040
What do I get out of this?

13:49.480 --> 13:50.840
Okay, go, scram

13:52.240 --> 13:53.520
before you piss me off.

13:57.120 --> 13:59.360
Look, 59,000 people,

14:00.840 --> 14:05.400
hundreds of comments, on Facebook alone,
saying, "Thanks to me--"

14:07.200 --> 14:10.960
But there's not one fucking newspaper
or journalist

14:11.560 --> 14:14.400
saying that everything started
with Pino Maniaci.

14:16.320 --> 14:18.720
Am I wrong, or has no one reported on it?

14:18.800 --> 14:21.080
What a fucking country, unbelievable.

14:22.960 --> 14:27.280
Silvana Saguto, former president
of the preventive measures department,

14:27.360 --> 14:30.080
has been sentenced
to eight and a half years in prison.

14:30.600 --> 14:33.040
She's accused
of running a corrupt administration

14:33.120 --> 14:37.120
and appointing judicial administrators
in exchange for money and favors…

14:39.400 --> 14:40.800
I'm proud of carrying out

14:40.880 --> 14:44.840
this investigation
and bringing about the convictions

14:44.920 --> 14:47.200
of the bad apples in the Court of Palermo

14:47.720 --> 14:50.840
and of this "magic circle," as we call it.

14:55.400 --> 14:57.960
Obviously, it leaves a bad taste
in your mouth

14:58.040 --> 15:02.200
because it's hard to tell people,
"Look, instead of administering justice…

15:02.280 --> 15:03.840
…they stole money."

15:05.400 --> 15:09.520
And if they don't review the laws,
there will be more Silvana Sagutos,

15:09.600 --> 15:11.280
who will do what she's done.

15:13.240 --> 15:16.640
-Is this good for my trial?
-Certainly, for your image.

15:17.880 --> 15:20.560
All this cash she has to pay out,
and none for me?

15:22.000 --> 15:23.480
For all the time I spent on her…

15:23.560 --> 15:28.440
We'll see, we'll see.
We could sue her in civil court.

15:29.080 --> 15:29.920
Really?

15:30.000 --> 15:32.760
-Let's wait for the outcome of the trial.
-Ah.

15:35.000 --> 15:39.000
In Italy, people say
the anti-Mafia is having a crisis.

15:39.680 --> 15:44.280
They use this label to refer to
the judiciary that works on Mafia cases,

15:44.800 --> 15:47.840
to the various groups
fighting the Mafia, etc.

15:49.280 --> 15:52.080
And they refer to the trials
like the Saguto trial,

15:52.160 --> 15:54.320
like Pino Maniaci's trial, like my trial

15:54.400 --> 15:58.320
because it involves
an anti-Mafia magistrate like Saguto,

15:58.400 --> 16:03.000
like myself, and an anti-Mafia journalist,
like Pino Maniaci.

16:03.680 --> 16:05.480
I think it's wrong to generalize.

16:06.800 --> 16:08.680
Each case has its own story.

16:16.320 --> 16:19.160
The prosecution
is seeking a four-year sentence

16:19.240 --> 16:23.840
for former public prosecutor,
Antonio Ingroia, for alleged embezzlement.

16:23.920 --> 16:27.160
According to the prosecutor,
he embezzled €100,000…

16:27.240 --> 16:29.800
ANTONIO INGROIA AWAITS
THE VERDICT OF HIS OWN TRIAL

16:31.720 --> 16:33.880
I've been accused
of embezzlement.

16:36.240 --> 16:39.320
This angers me, and… it offends my honor.

16:45.200 --> 16:46.920
-Hello?
-I'm here, my love.

16:47.680 --> 16:50.880
-Good morning, or rather goodnight.
-Good morning, love.

16:51.400 --> 16:54.680
I'm driving, I'm in my car,
I'm going to the hearing, as you know.

16:56.200 --> 16:58.040
I know, I was waiting for your call.

16:58.120 --> 17:00.080
VOICE OF GISELLE OBERTI

17:00.160 --> 17:04.360
I wanted to say hello,
and tell you that I'm very proud of you.

17:06.320 --> 17:10.600
You risked your own life for 30 years
fighting the Mafia, going up against them,

17:10.680 --> 17:12.760
and that bothered people so much,

17:12.840 --> 17:15.320
people who…
who didn't risk anything for 30 years.

17:15.400 --> 17:18.840
-It's all insane. It's crazy.
-Okay, okay. Come on.

17:18.920 --> 17:22.880
-Mm-hmm.
-Don't make me even more… nervous.

17:26.720 --> 17:29.040
I know I haven't made
any mistakes.

17:29.120 --> 17:30.800
I haven't committed any crimes.

17:32.440 --> 17:34.080
They should be thanking me.

17:34.880 --> 17:39.840
INGROIA TRIAL
VERDICT

17:41.320 --> 17:42.240
NOVEMBER 2020

17:42.320 --> 17:43.560
Of course…

17:47.320 --> 17:49.640
It's a little strange
coming back to this court

17:49.720 --> 17:52.920
where I was an anti-Mafia prosecutor
for a long time,

17:53.440 --> 17:55.200
and where I now work as a lawyer,

17:57.000 --> 17:58.800
it seems like a joke, you know,

18:00.240 --> 18:03.200
being here as a defendant in a trial
that's been…

18:03.280 --> 18:06.040
…going on for years.

18:09.200 --> 18:11.440
I always carry my lucky charm,

18:12.440 --> 18:14.920
my lucky coin, which I have with me

18:15.000 --> 18:16.600
in my most difficult times.

18:16.680 --> 18:19.640
I trust it as much
as I trust the justice system.

18:26.560 --> 18:28.360
ANTONIO INGROIA HAS REQUESTED

18:28.440 --> 18:30.280
ABBREVIATED JUDGMENT PROCEDURE

18:30.360 --> 18:32.600
WHICH TAKES PLACE BEHIND CLOSED DOORS

18:37.680 --> 18:41.800
Former Public Prosecutor Antonio Ingroia
has been sentenced by the Palermo Court

18:41.880 --> 18:44.560
to one year and ten months in prison
for embezzlement.

18:45.080 --> 18:47.320
The investigation that led to the trial…

18:48.120 --> 18:51.960
There are two charges against me,
one was about the performance bonus

18:52.040 --> 18:55.400
that I allegedly took illegally,
and I was acquitted of that.

18:58.240 --> 19:00.600
The other was
the reimbursement of expenses,

19:01.320 --> 19:03.200
and the judge sentenced me for that.

19:04.040 --> 19:04.960
It's disgusting.

19:07.400 --> 19:09.280
It's revolting to me.

19:09.360 --> 19:12.840
It should have been a complete acquittal,
which I believe I deserve.

19:20.880 --> 19:24.000
Italy is becoming
more and more out of balance.

19:27.120 --> 19:29.440
Lots of false things have been said today.

19:32.160 --> 19:34.960
I'm sorry to say that I see my future…

19:35.040 --> 19:36.360
…the rest of my days

19:36.440 --> 19:38.080
far away from Italy.

19:40.040 --> 19:42.840
I've always had a love for Latin America.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.440
In these last few years,

19:49.040 --> 19:50.480
something has broken.

19:54.680 --> 19:57.040
I lost faith in the justice system

19:57.840 --> 20:01.520
and its ability
to only indict guilty parties,

20:01.600 --> 20:04.240
having seen what is happening
to me and Pino.

20:05.120 --> 20:07.080
What I am certain of is,

20:07.160 --> 20:11.920
whatever the outcomes
of all the… the trials I'm involved in,

20:13.440 --> 20:16.200
I know that I will never relent.

20:17.400 --> 20:21.120
I'll always continue my work
to affirm the principles I believe in,

20:21.200 --> 20:23.280
the principles of justice and truth.

20:32.160 --> 20:34.680
DECEMBER 2020

20:35.800 --> 20:39.000
MANIACI TRIAL
THE PROSECUTION'S CLOSING STATEMENTS

20:48.320 --> 20:51.080
Can we have
the prosecution's closing statements?

20:53.400 --> 20:54.440
Your Honor,

20:56.880 --> 20:58.400
in the case of Pino Maniaci,

21:00.240 --> 21:03.920
we are not dealing with
the usual, crude methods of extortion

21:04.000 --> 21:06.120
carried out by lowly crooks.

21:08.720 --> 21:11.880
Pino Maniaci's technique
is far more refined.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.440
He sends a message in his news reports

21:17.520 --> 21:20.840
that over time breaks the spirit
of local officials,

21:20.920 --> 21:23.960
who basically succumb
to what can be described as

21:24.040 --> 21:27.320
a sort of "Chinese water torture effect,"

21:28.720 --> 21:33.160
a steady drip of reports through which
their reputation is continuously attacked

21:33.240 --> 21:34.280
and broken down.

21:35.640 --> 21:38.240
Dear Mr. Mayor,
do you know what the problem is?

21:38.760 --> 21:40.920
While you argue over responsibilities,

21:41.000 --> 21:42.800
the town is drowning in trash.

21:44.880 --> 21:47.520
Maniaci uses
a persistent pincer technique.

21:48.760 --> 21:53.320
He uses the media to either glorify
or denigrate local politicians,

21:53.400 --> 21:57.520
depending on the status
of the payments he attempts to coerce.

22:00.080 --> 22:01.960
He uses the stick and carrot method,

22:02.040 --> 22:04.840
some times praising
and some times attacking them…

22:06.240 --> 22:11.160
to make clear that the extorted money
maintains their image in the media.

22:12.280 --> 22:17.280
The support of a TV station claiming
to represent the voice of the anti-Mafia.

22:19.720 --> 22:21.400
He starts with defamation.

22:25.200 --> 22:30.000
The Mayor's visit to the United States
and his meetings are eyebrow-raising.

22:30.800 --> 22:32.760
Then he extorts money.

22:36.160 --> 22:40.240
Pino Maniaci presents himself
as a credible anti-Mafia hero.

22:43.920 --> 22:46.600
But the wiretaps reveal this image
to be a fraud.

22:49.360 --> 22:52.040
You have no idea
how powerful Pino Maniaci is.

22:52.120 --> 22:54.040
They reveal Pino Maniaci's method.

22:55.280 --> 22:58.360
This is a threat.
Do the interview and then fuck off.

23:00.040 --> 23:02.440
In other conversations,
Maniaci claims

23:02.520 --> 23:04.800
he has administration
in the palm of his hand

23:04.880 --> 23:07.320
through the power
of constant media pressure.

23:07.840 --> 23:10.800
These assholes have to do as I say.
Do you understand?

23:12.400 --> 23:15.240
He has shown himself
to be a two-faced journalist

23:15.320 --> 23:17.440
who has shamelessly abused his profession.

23:17.960 --> 23:19.440
She's so full of shit.

23:21.240 --> 23:22.800
In light of this,

23:24.000 --> 23:26.640
I ask that Pino Maniaci be sentenced

23:26.720 --> 23:32.400
to 11 years and six months in prison
and face a fine of €6,500,

23:33.840 --> 23:37.520
and we ask that the defendant
be declared a career con artist,

23:37.600 --> 23:39.320
as permitted by law.

23:40.280 --> 23:41.680
Fuck.

23:42.840 --> 23:45.160
A bit too much, I was expecting less.

23:50.320 --> 23:53.560
She drove me nuts
with all her bullshit. It drove me nuts.

23:53.640 --> 23:56.600
It's the prosecution's job.
She has an obligation.

23:57.120 --> 24:00.800
It may be her job, but she's made
a big mess of everything that happened

24:01.320 --> 24:03.280
because she's gone and distorted it.

24:04.280 --> 24:08.400
She was doing her duty,
drawing conclusions from the evidence

24:08.480 --> 24:12.440
to support the levied charges,
however founded or unfounded they may be.

24:13.480 --> 24:17.880
It's her right. And you shouldn't
have made those comments or faces.

24:32.120 --> 24:33.640
Who is Pino Maniaci?

24:36.360 --> 24:39.360
Pino Maniaci
is a very creative individual,

24:40.400 --> 24:42.640
who hasn't achieved much in his life.

24:48.320 --> 24:51.120
If he didn't have his TV station,

24:52.120 --> 24:54.880
he'd probably have become
a small time crook,

24:55.400 --> 24:58.320
a local scammer, trying to make ends meet.

24:59.760 --> 25:02.960
However, through television,
what he really wanted to achieve

25:03.960 --> 25:05.240
started to happen.

25:07.560 --> 25:10.080
He wanted to be a… protagonist.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.840
Pino loves investigative journalism.

25:18.120 --> 25:21.640
The fact is that he wasn't equipped
for such a big fight,

25:22.160 --> 25:26.640
and now he's paying the price.
It's become a crusade… he might not win.

25:33.400 --> 25:35.240
It's like a game of chess.

25:36.960 --> 25:39.800
Pino is the whole game,
not a single piece.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.920
The white, the prosecutor,
makes the first move.

25:47.360 --> 25:48.280
Now I'm using

25:49.640 --> 25:51.560
what we call, "The Sicilian defense."

25:53.760 --> 25:57.240
Defending while counter-attacking
to win the upper hand.

26:00.120 --> 26:03.240
FEBRUARY 2021

26:05.200 --> 26:10.480
MANIACI TRIAL
DEFENSE'S CLOSING STATEMENTS

26:13.640 --> 26:15.600
Why are we here?

26:17.440 --> 26:19.960
We are here to defend Pino Maniaci

26:20.040 --> 26:22.120
from an accusation that is absurd,

26:22.640 --> 26:27.400
unfounded, unjust, unproven, illogical,

26:28.280 --> 26:30.600
and to a large extent, ridiculous.

26:35.280 --> 26:41.920
I personally find it hard to understand…
since in my career as a prosecutor,

26:42.720 --> 26:44.600
and then a lawyer,

26:45.760 --> 26:48.240
I have never seen a request

26:48.320 --> 26:52.040
for eleven years and six months in prison
for charges like this.

26:57.480 --> 27:00.280
They are seeking a bigger sentence
than what was given

27:00.360 --> 27:03.640
to make an example
in the State versus the Mafia.

27:05.760 --> 27:09.880
Even bigger than Silvana Saguto's sentence
of eight and a half years in prison

27:10.880 --> 27:14.120
for corruption, forgery,
and abuse of power.

27:17.040 --> 27:18.920
Something isn't right.

27:20.520 --> 27:23.880
In this trial,
it is Pino Maniaci, the accused,

27:24.520 --> 27:26.040
who is the victim.

27:27.960 --> 27:28.840
It's them,

27:29.360 --> 27:31.480
the so-called victims,

27:32.440 --> 27:36.680
that pushed money on Maniaci
in the hope of buying his silence.

27:37.840 --> 27:40.920
It's they who are the corrupt ones.

27:41.440 --> 27:46.920
Of his own will, De Luca chose to sign
an advertising contract with Maniaci.

27:47.800 --> 27:50.800
He pushed it in the hope
of buying some improper leverage,

27:52.480 --> 27:54.720
and yet Maniaci resisted.

27:55.240 --> 27:57.000
He didn't wanna be corrupted.

27:57.520 --> 28:00.080
He carried on working on his news reports.

28:03.440 --> 28:05.160
Forget "The carrot and the stick."

28:06.440 --> 28:10.360
With Maniaci, there was only "the stick,"
accountability,

28:10.880 --> 28:13.120
and despite
the many attempts to bribe him,

28:14.320 --> 28:18.600
in particular by De Luca
and his entourage, Maniaci never gave up.

28:19.240 --> 28:21.680
That is the reason De Luca got angry

28:22.200 --> 28:23.720
because De Luca failed

28:25.000 --> 28:27.160
at his attempts to corrupt Maniaci.

28:29.200 --> 28:30.200
That is the reason

28:30.280 --> 28:32.880
Polizzi on the phone called him
"an extortioner"

28:34.360 --> 28:36.400
because he thought
that by buying t-shirts,

28:36.480 --> 28:38.520
he could buy Maniaci's silence.

28:38.600 --> 28:39.840
But he couldn't!

28:41.640 --> 28:43.840
Pino Maniaci is not for sale.

28:51.760 --> 28:53.640
How did it come to this?

28:54.200 --> 28:57.600
When did we get to this trial,
and why did it come to this?

28:59.080 --> 29:03.200
There are names that are hiding
in the shadows behind this story.

29:04.960 --> 29:07.080
Big names that are embarrassing

29:07.160 --> 29:09.080
for the judicial institutions.

29:10.720 --> 29:12.120
First and foremost,

29:12.840 --> 29:14.440
is Silvana Saguto.

29:18.480 --> 29:20.240
They wanted to protect Saguto.

29:22.160 --> 29:23.600
Mission failed.

29:25.320 --> 29:26.560
Mission failed.

29:33.560 --> 29:35.880
MARCH 2021

29:51.400 --> 29:54.200
-No sugar. It is sugared.
-It's not.

29:54.720 --> 29:56.680
No one wants to work?

29:56.760 --> 29:58.520
-…boy?
-No, no, no.

29:58.600 --> 30:01.280
Okay.

30:03.360 --> 30:04.440
Are the dogs out?

30:06.240 --> 30:09.520
-Let Chira out.
-Chira, let's go. Come on.

30:09.600 --> 30:10.680
Good girl.

30:15.480 --> 30:17.160
Now, I'm just waiting…

30:19.160 --> 30:21.280
I trust in the magistracy.

30:24.280 --> 30:26.080
Some people don't, but…

30:29.760 --> 30:31.560
But I think it will all be fine.

30:33.080 --> 30:35.320
Giulia! Come here. Here, Giulia.

30:35.840 --> 30:36.720
Giulita!

30:38.600 --> 30:43.040
I'd do it all again.
I'll never regret any of it.

30:45.480 --> 30:46.880
I've got nothing to lose.

30:48.840 --> 30:51.880
Come here. Let's go. Come on.

30:53.200 --> 30:55.440
I was 16 when I started
going out with Pino,

30:56.280 --> 30:59.760
so I know how to deal with him,
how not to deal with him, you know?

31:00.680 --> 31:01.880
Stay. Stay down.

31:01.960 --> 31:03.200
Stay. What is it?

31:04.000 --> 31:06.720
I can't say
that he was a saint before,

31:07.320 --> 31:08.800
nor is he a devil now.

31:09.560 --> 31:12.360
He's always been someone
who stands up for what's right.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
Nobody is perfect,

31:16.520 --> 31:17.680
he isn't perfect.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.320
But to be accused of extorting money,

31:22.400 --> 31:28.360
doing everything he's been accused of,
to me it all seems a little bit absurd.

31:28.880 --> 31:29.720
Too absurd.

31:30.840 --> 31:32.960
We'll see how it ends.
I hope it goes well.

31:34.000 --> 31:34.840
We'll see.

31:40.640 --> 31:43.400
My family knows
that I'm being crucified

31:45.080 --> 31:47.560
to make me pay the price
for my fight for justice.

31:51.160 --> 31:52.720
They've weathered the storm.

31:54.520 --> 31:57.480
They love me so much,
they've put up with it all.

31:59.240 --> 32:01.520
And obviously, they want to move forward,

32:02.280 --> 32:03.640
especially Letizia,

32:04.240 --> 32:05.600
with the TV station,

32:06.440 --> 32:08.520
so we're moving forward.

32:21.840 --> 32:26.280
-Let's dance. Let's dance!
-Dance. It's his birthday.

32:28.400 --> 32:30.400
Come on. We can do better than that.

32:32.320 --> 32:34.280
Come here. We can hear it better here.

32:51.240 --> 32:54.400
We all make
lots of mistakes in life,

32:56.080 --> 32:59.000
and I think that this… is one of those.

33:01.640 --> 33:04.320
It has been incredibly tough for them

33:04.840 --> 33:05.680
because…

33:13.600 --> 33:16.280
If I haven't apologized
or asked for forgiveness,

33:18.400 --> 33:21.800
it's because I don't even have
the strength to look them in the eye.

33:23.920 --> 33:24.800
Let's go!

33:32.760 --> 33:35.760
APRIL 2021

33:47.560 --> 33:48.440
Okay.

33:52.080 --> 33:53.960
I'm calm, very relaxed.

33:57.600 --> 34:02.640
I didn't do what they're accusing me of,
so I'm very calm,

34:02.720 --> 34:05.680
despite a possible
eleven-and-a-half-year sentence.

34:08.800 --> 34:13.240
What's important for me,
is that I have… peace of mind.

34:20.000 --> 34:23.920
MANIACI TRIAL
THE VERDICT

34:29.120 --> 34:31.400
In 15 or 20 minutes,
they'll have the verdict.

34:31.480 --> 34:33.920
-They called us.
-Great. Here we are.

34:34.000 --> 34:37.360
-Can we go?
-Yes. Did they tell you too?

34:37.440 --> 34:38.280
Okay.

34:39.920 --> 34:40.760
Let's go.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.360
What's your prediction?

34:55.880 --> 34:58.080
-What?
-What's your prediction?

34:59.040 --> 35:02.040
I'm moderately optimistic.
Moderately.

35:02.120 --> 35:03.480
Fuck. Moderately?

35:03.560 --> 35:06.120
-Can't be too…
-Optimistically optimistic?

35:06.200 --> 35:07.040
…too optimistic.

35:10.120 --> 35:13.040
It's good to be… to be cautious.

36:18.480 --> 36:20.400
"In the name of the Italian people,

36:20.480 --> 36:22.880
the Court of Palermo,
second criminal division,

36:22.960 --> 36:26.200
presided by a sole judge,
has issued the following sentence."

36:26.640 --> 36:30.240
DEFAMATION CHARGE - TWO COUNTS

36:34.600 --> 36:38.320
"We declare Giuseppe Maniaci
guilty of the charges.

He is sentenced to

as well as the payment of the court fees."

36:49.280 --> 36:52.360
EXTORTION CHARGE - FOUR COUNTS

37:05.440 --> 37:07.240
Thank you, hearing adjourned.

37:07.840 --> 37:13.120
PINO MANIACI IS ACQUITTED
OF ALL CHARGES FOR EXTORTION

37:14.520 --> 37:18.160
Sentenced to a year and a half
for defamation

37:18.240 --> 37:20.000
and made to pay some court fees…

37:20.080 --> 37:22.400
And acquitted of all charges of extortion.

37:23.360 --> 37:26.000
The prosecution of Palermo
has made a fool of itself.

37:29.320 --> 37:31.920
Acquitted of the charge of extortion,
Pino Maniaci,

37:32.000 --> 37:34.600
journalist and founder of Telejato,
was first hit

37:34.680 --> 37:37.880
with an anti-Mafia Department inquest
back in 2016.

37:40.480 --> 37:41.400
Thanks.

37:41.480 --> 37:44.160
Will Pino Maniaci
continue in journalism?

37:44.800 --> 37:48.200
Always.
And I ask you to do the same

37:48.280 --> 37:51.400
because these are the risks
we take being journalists.

37:52.680 --> 37:56.200
The verdict is a victory
for Pino Maniaci, director of Telejato,

37:56.280 --> 38:00.000
the TV station in Partinico that's been
fighting the Mafia for many years.

38:02.160 --> 38:05.440
I never thought of myself
as an anti-Mafia journalist.

38:06.000 --> 38:07.720
It's a label that others gave me.

38:08.880 --> 38:10.360
But having said that,

38:12.680 --> 38:15.240
I have been destroyed by private wiretaps

38:15.320 --> 38:18.160
that had nothing to do
with the fight against the Mafia.

38:18.240 --> 38:19.720
What do you think about that?

38:24.680 --> 38:29.320
I'm overjoyed…
because there was a real fear

38:29.400 --> 38:31.640
of receiving a harsher sentence.

38:31.720 --> 38:36.640
This verdict shows you can get justice.
You can't give up, you have to believe it.

38:36.720 --> 38:40.280
I never stopped believing there would be
light at the end of the tunnel.

38:40.360 --> 38:42.760
Today, we have reached that light.

38:43.640 --> 38:44.760
Be good now…

38:46.880 --> 38:48.000
and behave yourself.

38:51.080 --> 38:51.960
You're live.

38:53.280 --> 38:55.040
We never bowed down. Never.

38:55.120 --> 38:58.200
Not at all.
We have to be stronger from now on.

38:59.600 --> 39:01.640
Welcome to today's Telejato News.

39:01.720 --> 39:04.120
9TH OF APRIL 2021

39:04.200 --> 39:05.880
Today, I hope you'll forgive us

39:05.960 --> 39:08.240
for taking up most of the airtime

39:08.320 --> 39:11.080
to talk about ourselves
and obviously, the…

39:11.160 --> 39:12.880
Telejato never stopped.

39:14.160 --> 39:17.080
Telejato moves forward,
we know what my dad is like,

39:17.160 --> 39:18.560
he won't give up easily.

39:20.320 --> 39:21.560
Come on. I'll kill them.

39:21.640 --> 39:22.640
Letizia!

39:25.720 --> 39:27.440
Get everything out of the printer!

39:30.320 --> 39:32.800
Throughout this long and ugly story…

39:36.240 --> 39:38.440
I was used to fighting criminals,

39:38.520 --> 39:41.800
mafiosos, small crooks,
and organized crime.

39:43.200 --> 39:44.560
Let's film the TV antenna.

39:44.640 --> 39:46.840
No one realized Provenzano had a TV.

39:46.920 --> 39:49.160
Look, he might have watched Telejato.

39:54.080 --> 39:56.360
Now, I've learned
to fight the powers that be.

39:57.720 --> 39:59.160
We've called you thieves.

40:00.240 --> 40:01.800
We've called you vultures.

40:02.440 --> 40:03.560
Look at this.

40:05.200 --> 40:07.680
My character, my way of doing things,

40:07.760 --> 40:10.640
my balls of steel
allow me to move forward,

40:10.720 --> 40:12.320
and we will continue our fights,

40:12.400 --> 40:14.760
as long as my health allows me to do so.

40:18.200 --> 40:21.600
AFTER THE VERDICT
TELEJATO EXPANDED ITS AUDIENCE

40:21.680 --> 40:25.000
AND IT IS NOW AVAILABLE  ALL ACROSS SICILY

40:38.480 --> 40:40.400
When I heard they'd acquitted Maniaci,

40:40.920 --> 40:42.480
I almost laughed out loud.

40:45.960 --> 40:47.920
I really find justice to be…

40:48.000 --> 40:50.240
um… um…

40:51.440 --> 40:52.520
incomprehensible.

40:55.120 --> 40:58.640
It's absurd for Maniaci to say
he's the victim of a vendetta…

41:00.880 --> 41:02.360
of the system that I managed

41:02.440 --> 41:05.640
because it's like saying
I orchestrated my own demise.

41:08.360 --> 41:11.040
It's so ridiculous.
It's a contradiction in terms.

41:11.960 --> 41:13.200
If I had been acquitted,

41:15.600 --> 41:18.600
that might make more sense
because it would show a sort of…

41:18.680 --> 41:20.160
honor among thieves.

41:26.280 --> 41:29.560
Everyone was always saying to me,
"Why don't you write a book?"

41:29.640 --> 41:31.680
And I would say, "I don't have time."

41:32.280 --> 41:34.920
Now, unfortunately, I have time.

41:37.520 --> 41:41.000
I have faith that I'll be able
to overturn the verdict in an appeal.

41:42.720 --> 41:45.880
We'll have to see. It doesn't end here.

41:47.160 --> 41:49.320
I've dealt with many hardships in my life.

41:50.920 --> 41:51.920
I'll deal with this.

41:54.760 --> 41:57.960
THE SENTENCES OF PINO MANIACI,
ANTONIO INGROIA, SILVANA SAGUTO

41:58.040 --> 42:00.240
AND HER CO-DEFENDANTS ARE NON-BINDING

42:00.720 --> 42:04.080
ALL PARTIES CAN APPEAL

42:04.720 --> 42:07.680
IN MOST CASES DEFENDANTS ARE IMPRISONED

42:07.760 --> 42:11.120
ONLY AFTER THE FINAL SENTENCE
FROM THE HIGH COURT

42:23.400 --> 42:26.760
WE WILL CARRY ON
WITH PEPPINO'S IDEAS AND COURAGE

42:29.600 --> 42:32.480
The Mafia isn't invincible.
It's a human creation,

42:32.560 --> 42:36.360
and like all human creations, it has
a beginning, and it will have an end.

42:42.720 --> 42:45.240
They can't be defeated
by everyday heroes alone,

42:46.360 --> 42:50.720
but by gathering all the best forces in
the institutions involved in the battle.

42:55.800 --> 42:57.240
I have said very often

42:57.320 --> 42:58.480
ANTI-MAFIA JUDGE

42:58.560 --> 43:01.680
that the existence
of the Mafia is an alibi,

43:03.280 --> 43:04.280
a scapegoat…

43:06.240 --> 43:10.000
used to justify wrongdoings
in all parts of our society.
