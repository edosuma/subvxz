The army manipulated us.

something from the tech area?</i>

00:35.668 --> 00:37.771

00:39.906 --> 00:43.109
There isn't always a medical
explanation in these cases.

00:43.143 --> 00:47.213
So it was an act of God?

00:47.246 --> 00:50.216
The longer that it takes
anyone to deliver a weapon,

00:50.250 --> 00:53.653
the less chance anyone has of
dropping it over a city full of kids.

<i>( knocks on door )</i>

And now, now we're doing our most
dangerous work yet... criticality.

03:32.545 --> 03:34.215
Pushing the gadget to the brink

03:34.247 --> 03:36.049
of an explosive chain reaction.

03:45.292 --> 03:47.260
down off the blackboard and into the world,

03:47.294 --> 03:48.896
and we deserve better.

03:48.929 --> 03:50.765
All: Yeah! Yeah!

03:50.798 --> 03:53.134
- We need strict exposure limits.
- Yes!

03:53.167 --> 03:56.771
- And hazard pay!
- And we're going to demand it.

03:56.804 --> 03:58.472
But first I want to tell you

03:58.504 --> 04:00.373
about something that's happening right now

04:00.407 --> 04:01.909
in Washington, DC.

04:01.942 --> 04:03.444
While we are risking our necks,

04:03.477 --> 04:05.513
President Roosevelt is
assembling a committee.

04:05.545 --> 04:07.981
It's going to decide how the gadget's used,

04:08.014 --> 04:09.783
if and when it's dropped,

04:09.817 --> 04:11.385
and who it's going to be dropped on.

04:11.418 --> 04:14.320
And this committee includes
no scientists or engineers.

04:14.354 --> 04:16.357
- Wait, is this a safety board?
- No.

04:16.389 --> 04:17.957
- Are they setting new health standards?
- No, no, no.

04:17.990 --> 04:19.425
It's called the Target Committee,

04:19.459 --> 04:21.829
and as it stands, no one
who helped build the bomb

04:21.862 --> 04:25.165
will have any say in how
or where it's deployed.

04:25.199 --> 04:28.401
But... but if we'd all write
a letter to our supervisor...

04:28.435 --> 04:30.403
Let them deploy it up Eva Braun's ass.

04:30.437 --> 04:32.038
We have bigger problems here on the Hill.

04:39.213 --> 04:40.980
You didn't even read them my sample letter.

04:41.014 --> 04:43.016
These guys don't care about sample letters.

04:43.050 --> 04:45.451
They care about getting their balls
fried off in a criticality experiment.

04:45.485 --> 04:47.254
You're supposed to make them care, Helen.

04:47.286 --> 04:48.588
You're supposed to make them see

04:48.622 --> 04:51.225
it's all part of the same question.

04:51.257 --> 04:52.892
Well, you know what Mussolini says,

04:52.925 --> 04:54.829
"If you want something
done right, do it yourself."

04:54.862 --> 04:58.265
Well, I can't do that right now.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.533
Not while I'm wearing this uniform.

05:00.567 --> 05:02.903
They already look at
me like I'm a secretary.

05:02.935 --> 05:06.472
And you want me to stand up
there, lecture them about politics?

05:06.505 --> 05:08.074
You should find an inside man

05:08.108 --> 05:10.944
who's actually on the inside.

05:10.978 --> 05:12.213

who missed work this morning?

05:32.598 --> 05:34.901
I know about your little meeting.

05:37.103 --> 05:40.406
- What's the hay for?
- Horses.

05:40.439 --> 05:42.041
Horses? Are we Amish?

05:42.074 --> 05:43.343
We have jeeps on the site.

05:43.377 --> 05:45.946
Oh, a corps of engineers
set up a polo league.

05:45.978 --> 05:47.947
- It's good for morale, I guess.
- Jesus.

05:47.980 --> 05:49.916
Well, make sure they clean up the shit.

05:49.949 --> 05:52.185
I want the site spit-shined by Thursday.

05:52.218 --> 05:54.254
Mm, you know it's a desert, right?

05:54.288 --> 05:56.557
What happens Thursday?

05:56.589 --> 06:01.194
Just, um, make sure it doesn't
look like a rodeo out there.

06:01.228 --> 06:03.264
Aye, aye.

06:03.297 --> 06:05.232
Um, I was thinking...

06:05.264 --> 06:07.967
after our
not-so-secret meeting,

06:08.000 --> 06:09.135
we should be studying

06:09.168 --> 06:11.337
the radiological effects of the test.

06:11.370 --> 06:13.072
On what?

06:13.105 --> 06:16.175
The planet. People.

06:16.209 --> 06:19.379
I swallowed 24 micrograms
of plutonium in 1943.

06:19.413 --> 06:23.050
Now it's 1945. I still make
the Geiger counter sing.

06:24.951 --> 06:27.153
Find me a PhD-level subject matter expert

06:27.187 --> 06:28.989
who's already on the Hill.

06:29.021 --> 06:30.324
If he's willing to run the study

06:30.357 --> 06:32.192
during his free time,

06:32.225 --> 06:34.061
you have my blessing.

06:34.093 --> 06:35.995
Thank you.

06:36.028 --> 06:38.966
You meet Charlie's qualifications...
that's the good news.

06:38.999 --> 06:40.701
I asked for the bad news first.

06:40.733 --> 06:43.103
Security clearance for the test site.

06:43.136 --> 06:44.471
Holiest of Holies.

06:44.504 --> 06:46.640
The only person who
can authorize that is...

06:46.673 --> 06:49.375
- The colonel.
- Correct.

06:49.408 --> 06:52.278
He's got to listen to reason, right?

06:52.312 --> 06:55.615
Fritzy, this is a man who
sent a boy to his death

06:55.649 --> 06:57.350
to stop me from speaking to my husband.

06:57.384 --> 06:59.153
I don't think he's gonna turn around

06:59.185 --> 07:00.620
and hand me a security badge.

07:00.653 --> 07:02.588
Look, we need you.

07:02.622 --> 07:04.625
Last week three engineers
nearly barbecued themselves

07:04.658 --> 07:06.360
doing the criticality experiment.

07:06.392 --> 07:09.296
Blammo, a month's exposure
in three seconds flat.

07:11.098 --> 07:13.334
- In the tech area?
- Yeah.

07:13.367 --> 07:16.237

- Don't know.

Do you think that God
still punishes people?

12:26.011 --> 12:27.814
What personal reasons?

12:30.917 --> 12:33.552
Come to G group.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.621
Don't screw around with me, Charlie.

12:35.654 --> 12:37.257
We need you.

12:38.725 --> 12:40.694
I need you.

12:43.028 --> 12:44.331
Why now?

12:45.498 --> 12:46.833
The test is three months off,

12:46.865 --> 12:49.195
we're shorthanded and underbrained,

12:49.230 --> 12:50.877
and this Thursday...

12:50.912 --> 12:53.339
Jesus, as if we didn't
have enough to worry about.

12:53.373 --> 12:54.875
What? What happens Thursday?

12:54.908 --> 12:56.909
- Someone's coming.
- Who?

12:56.942 --> 12:58.745
Vannevar Bush.

12:58.778 --> 13:02.047
F.D.R.'s science advisor
is coming to the Hill?

13:02.082 --> 13:04.016
Sits at the right tire of God the Father.

13:04.049 --> 13:06.319
Here to review the test preparations.

13:06.352 --> 13:07.654
You can't tell anyone.

13:11.024 --> 13:12.926
The job doesn't come with a raise.

13:15.128 --> 13:16.562
Okay, boss.

13:17.864 --> 13:19.500
( Helen chuckles )

13:27.207 --> 13:28.943
I heard they liberated another camp.

13:28.976 --> 13:30.745
That must put a spring in your step.

13:30.778 --> 13:33.147
Yes.

13:33.179 --> 13:35.482
And to think we're on the other
side of the world doing our bit.

13:35.515 --> 13:37.751
( board buzzes)

13:38.851 --> 13:40.920
Operator.

13:40.953 --> 13:43.957
Paul: <i>I want to make you wetter
than Dartmoor in November.</i>

13:43.991 --> 13:46.393
Yes, sir. I'll put you right through.

13:46.425 --> 13:48.762
Put me right through? Patience, Constance.

13:48.795 --> 13:51.030
Roll your skirt up
first. Give us a forecast.

13:51.063 --> 13:53.134
<i>( line ringing )</i>

13:53.167 --> 13:55.035
<i>Bingham here. Clear?</i>

13:55.068 --> 13:57.037
Clear as a bell, Site
X. Stand by one chorus?

13:57.069 --> 13:59.073
<i>"Roast Beef of Old England."</i>

14:10.449 --> 14:12.352
( machine humming )

14:24.236 --> 14:26.640
_

14:35.542 --> 14:37.411
So it's an assistant directorship

14:37.443 --> 14:39.078
out at the test site.

14:39.111 --> 14:41.115
I'm going to be refining lens design.

14:41.148 --> 14:43.350
There's still some asymmetries to work out.

14:43.382 --> 14:45.852
Isaacs just threw you a bone.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.921
What happened?

14:47.954 --> 14:49.956
Nothing happened.

14:49.990 --> 14:52.159
He just realized he made a mistake.

14:54.193 --> 14:56.963
Well, that's great, Helen. You deserve it.

14:56.996 --> 15:00.000
Enjoy your last day
under the British Empire.

15:04.036 --> 15:05.538
Hey, Frank?

15:09.610 --> 15:12.480
F.D.R.'s science advisor is
touring the test site this week.

15:15.882 --> 15:18.284
Vannevar Bush is coming west?

15:18.318 --> 15:20.187
Yes.

15:20.220 --> 15:21.856
No one can find out I told you.

15:21.889 --> 15:24.225
Hey, you have to... well,
you have to get him alone.

15:24.257 --> 15:26.226
He's Roosevelt's brain.

15:26.260 --> 15:28.428
He can get us a seat
on the Target Committee.

15:28.462 --> 15:31.030
I can't do that, Frank. I mean...

15:31.063 --> 15:32.967
I need some time to settle it.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.635
The test is in 90 days.

15:34.668 --> 15:38.038
You need time to, what, climb the ladder?

15:38.071 --> 15:40.441
I can't petition the White
House on my first day of the job.

15:40.473 --> 15:43.076
I'll wind up straight back where I started.

15:44.977 --> 15:47.147
Yeah. You're right.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.885
Don't make me regret telling you.

15:58.896 --> 16:02.349
_

16:06.565 --> 16:08.995
_

16:11.296 --> 16:13.498
_

16:13.533 --> 16:14.741
_

16:14.775 --> 16:17.819
_

16:31.558 --> 16:33.994
Liza: <i>I have followed
your orders to the letter.</i>

16:34.026 --> 16:36.529
I haven't spoken to my
husband in months, as you know.

16:38.198 --> 16:40.333
Please send him my best next time you do.

16:40.366 --> 16:43.069
But you're still a known
agitator, Mrs. Winter.

16:43.102 --> 16:45.405
I prefer "rogue botanist."

16:45.438 --> 16:47.341
And you want me to grant you access

16:47.374 --> 16:49.710
to the most secure site
in the Western Hemisphere

16:49.742 --> 16:52.011
- so that you can...
- Determine the health effects

16:52.044 --> 16:53.514
of atomic radiation and debris.

16:53.547 --> 16:56.417
I think the Axis is gonna
find that out soon enough.

16:56.449 --> 16:59.020
Colonel, it's not the
Axis I'm worried about.

17:01.188 --> 17:02.488
What am I looking at?

17:02.522 --> 17:06.126
Well, this is your office here,

17:06.159 --> 17:08.194
and right here,

17:08.227 --> 17:10.531
only 20 yards away, is Building E.

17:10.563 --> 17:12.465
Now, do you know what
happens in Building E?

17:12.498 --> 17:14.734
Something above your clearance.

17:14.767 --> 17:18.204
Well, that wouldn't stop it from
killing me if it went fast critical

17:18.237 --> 17:22.075
and I was sitting in your chair.

17:22.108 --> 17:25.145
I heard you had an event last week...

17:25.178 --> 17:27.080
a couple of graduate students

17:27.113 --> 17:29.048
set off a fast-neutron chain reaction.

17:29.082 --> 17:31.718
I believe they call it
"tickling the dragon's tail."

17:31.752 --> 17:34.154
I know what it's called.

17:34.187 --> 17:36.622
The dragons I know
don't like to be tickled.

17:36.656 --> 17:40.561
Four seconds longer, and it
would have become self-sustaining.

17:41.594 --> 17:43.363
So now let's assume

17:43.397 --> 17:46.400
fast criticality sustained
for two to three minutes.

17:46.432 --> 17:51.204
Radiant intensity is the
inverse square of distance.

17:51.237 --> 17:53.474
Factoring in the lack of concrete walls

17:53.506 --> 17:57.276
that mitigate exposure...

17:57.310 --> 18:00.014
you and your staff would most likely be...

18:00.046 --> 18:02.315
well, dead.

18:02.349 --> 18:05.085
I say "most likely" because, Colonel,

18:05.118 --> 18:09.049
we don't actually know, but we could.

18:37.583 --> 18:39.753
Oh, I'm just a stagehand.

Well, we're on a desert island here.

19:06.246 --> 19:07.814
There's a petition going around.

19:07.848 --> 19:09.249
F.D.R. is forming a committee

19:09.282 --> 19:11.418
to decide how the gadget gets used.

19:11.450 --> 19:13.319
We want a seat at the table.

19:13.352 --> 19:15.322
We?

19:15.354 --> 19:17.524
You didn't sign it, did you?

19:17.556 --> 19:19.159
This is a good thing.

19:19.191 --> 19:21.861
No. No, not for you, it's not.

19:21.894 --> 19:25.331
You don't sign anything.
You don't stand for anything.

19:25.364 --> 19:27.500
You need to earn Charlie Isaacs' trust.

19:27.534 --> 19:29.870
That is your role.

19:29.902 --> 19:31.604
Stick to the script.

19:34.708 --> 19:35.574
Well...

19:35.609 --> 19:37.778
you didn't congratulate me, by the way.

19:37.811 --> 19:41.448
For what? Getting the
lead in a racialist play?

19:41.480 --> 19:43.717
Well, "The Mikado" isn't really about Japan.

19:43.749 --> 19:46.886
It's a satire of British social mores.

19:46.919 --> 19:49.656
You need to lay off that pitch pipe.

19:49.688 --> 19:52.592
It's cutting off the
oxygen to your brain.

20:04.204 --> 20:05.953

20:08.941 --> 20:10.710
There's something you ought to know.

20:13.580 --> 20:16.183
He's circulating some
kind of protest screed.

20:16.216 --> 20:17.793
Is that right?

20:17.828 --> 20:20.720
It's a petition, Colonel,
advancing the revolutionary idea

20:20.754 --> 20:22.421
that the people who built the gadget

20:22.455 --> 20:23.657
might have some say in how it's used.

20:23.689 --> 20:24.824
You're a physicist,

20:24.858 --> 20:26.726
not an expert in geopolitics.

20:26.759 --> 20:28.661
You think the guys why
designed the B-29 bomber

20:28.695 --> 20:30.397
got to pick their targets?

20:30.429 --> 20:31.765
He doesn't just want a seat at the table.

20:31.797 --> 20:34.134
He wants to shut down the project.

20:39.505 --> 20:42.242
Let Dr. Winter run his
BVDs up the flagpole.

20:42.275 --> 20:44.611
<i>We'll see who salutes.</i>

20:44.643 --> 20:46.813
Now, if we're done
second-guessing democracy,

20:46.845 --> 20:48.582
you're both dismissed.

21:00.627 --> 21:03.117
You can't dismiss me. I'm not a soldier.

21:04.046 --> 21:07.501
Why don't you go focus on
your criticality experiments?

21:07.534 --> 21:08.705
It sounds like you have your hands full

21:08.740 --> 21:11.171
not blowing us to kingdom come.

21:20.246 --> 21:21.515

21:25.752 --> 21:27.655
Get me an outside line.

21:30.724 --> 21:32.307
Justice Department.

21:32.342 --> 21:35.042
Colonel Emmett Darrow for Director Hoover.

21:40.934 --> 21:42.703
I told you to be discreet!

21:42.736 --> 21:46.305
Now you're unionizing the tech area?

21:46.339 --> 21:47.679
I didn't involve you.

21:47.714 --> 21:48.886
What, you think Charlie won't figure out

21:48.921 --> 21:50.161
who told you that Bush was coming?

21:50.196 --> 21:51.423
A couple of my bunk mates

21:51.458 --> 21:52.897
are acting as his military escort.

21:52.932 --> 21:54.111
Maybe I heard it from them.

21:54.146 --> 21:55.682
Helen, we won't get another chance.

21:55.715 --> 21:57.551
Well, neither will I.

22:01.920 --> 22:04.423
The colonel's running
some kind of game on me.

22:04.457 --> 22:06.892
Isaacs won't let me
anywhere near Vannevar Bush.

22:06.926 --> 22:09.362
So, here, you have to give it to him.

22:09.396 --> 22:12.332
Or burn it on Isaacs' altar.

22:12.364 --> 22:14.467
Keep your chair in G group.

22:18.753 --> 22:20.656
I know you'll do the right thing.

22:31.717 --> 22:34.420
<i>( man speaking over P.A. )</i>

22:37.269 --> 22:38.815
Hang back there, Private.

22:41.087 --> 22:43.796
Look, if the colonel sent you, I
already kissed the ring, all right?

22:43.830 --> 22:45.351
No, not the colonel, soldier.

22:45.386 --> 22:47.701
You're on the head of the tech area's dime.

22:47.734 --> 22:49.770
Pack your bivouac gear, Winter.

22:49.803 --> 22:51.772
<i>You'll be spending a couple
nights in the desert.</i>

22:53.773 --> 22:55.509
Let me guess...

22:55.542 --> 22:57.077
I'm not returning until the weekend

22:57.110 --> 22:59.813
after our distinguished visitor is gone.

22:59.845 --> 23:03.015
What are we gonna do out
there, water some cactus?

23:03.048 --> 23:05.885
You're gonna tickle the dragon's tail.

23:23.089 --> 23:24.068
Engineer: <i>Shit.</i>

23:24.103 --> 23:27.039
<i>That's the spook's car.</i>

23:27.073 --> 23:29.042
You know I heard they found
him floating in the back

23:29.074 --> 23:30.611
just like a canned sardine?

24:05.620 --> 24:08.122
( clicking )

24:40.611 --> 24:43.748
So, you beat Tosa.

24:43.781 --> 24:45.583
Got out of Texas.

24:45.617 --> 24:47.353
Congratulations.

24:59.319 --> 25:01.500
Although if I'm here,

25:01.532 --> 25:04.002
that means you're not all there.

25:04.036 --> 25:07.974
So, maybe Tosa beat you after all.

25:10.908 --> 25:13.330
Let's go.

25:13.365 --> 25:15.748
Some lady biologist got
in the colonel's craw.

25:15.780 --> 25:18.350
He banned criticality
work inside the gates.

25:18.384 --> 25:21.520
- You say lady biologist?
- Yeah.

25:21.552 --> 25:23.139
Now you got to irradiate yourself

25:23.174 --> 25:25.891
30 miles from the nearest doctor.

25:25.924 --> 25:28.426
How close did we get to fast critical

25:28.460 --> 25:30.047
before the incident?

25:30.082 --> 25:32.131
Uh, 88%.

25:32.164 --> 25:33.589
The goal today is to get to 90

25:33.624 --> 25:35.232
without waking the dragon
and killing yourself.

25:35.267 --> 25:37.001
Well, let's hope that happens.

25:40.882 --> 25:42.941
- You're not coming?
- <i>Doctor's orders.</i>

25:42.974 --> 25:45.010
Last week... five roentgens, three seconds.

25:45.042 --> 25:47.847
Whole team maxed out
exposure for the month.

25:47.879 --> 25:49.482
That's why you're here.

25:55.788 --> 25:57.123
"Tickling the dragon's tail."

25:57.155 --> 25:59.992
Nice phrase, very evocative.

26:00.024 --> 26:02.394
Your wife's boyfriend would love it.

26:04.061 --> 26:07.699
This is how you
double-check a critical mass?

26:07.732 --> 26:10.502
Play chicken with an
unshielded atomic pile?

26:10.536 --> 26:12.153
Me, I'd go AWOL

26:12.188 --> 26:16.376
before I hit 60% of fast
critical on the neutron counter.

26:45.686 --> 26:48.389
I preferred the trunk of my car.

27:32.717 --> 27:34.586
Dr. Crosley has a scheduled call.

27:34.619 --> 27:36.121
I'd best put him through.

27:41.659 --> 27:44.829
Operator. I have Site X for you.

27:44.863 --> 27:47.533
Yes, sir. Go ahead.

27:52.203 --> 27:55.107
<i>( printer clacking )</i>

28:23.762 --> 28:25.262
Oh! Oh, dear.

28:25.366 --> 28:26.224
Oh.

28:27.739 --> 28:29.107
Carry your books, Mrs. Isaacs?

28:29.140 --> 28:31.009
Yes, please. Thank you.

28:31.042 --> 28:32.810
Oh!

28:32.844 --> 28:34.547
- I'll get these.
- Thank you.

28:34.579 --> 28:35.981
- You get that.
- Oh!

28:36.013 --> 28:37.982
( chuckles ) Paul Crosley.

28:38.015 --> 28:39.885
Yes, I remember.

28:40.930 --> 28:42.878
Long day crossing wires?

28:42.913 --> 28:46.058
Uh, it's better than sitting at home.

28:46.090 --> 28:47.325
Tom Lancefield's wife used to work

28:47.358 --> 28:49.093
at the switchboard, didn't she?

28:49.126 --> 28:51.030
Attractive girl. French, of course,

28:51.062 --> 28:53.232
but that's a venial sin nowadays.

28:53.264 --> 28:55.700
You two were friendly, weren't you?

28:55.733 --> 28:57.667
Yes, well, we were very sad to see her go.

28:57.702 --> 28:59.656
But then Constance
Faraday joined our ranks,

28:59.691 --> 29:02.189
and she's just wonderful.
Do you know Constance?

29:02.224 --> 29:03.214
Mm...

29:03.249 --> 29:05.711
I just assumed that all
you Brits know each other.

29:05.743 --> 29:07.812
Well, the empire has dwindled, to be sure,

29:07.846 --> 29:11.016
but it's not a Shropshire village just yet.

29:11.049 --> 29:13.552
- Yes.
- Fancy a ride, Mrs. Isaacs?

29:14.242 --> 29:15.078
Uh...

29:20.479 --> 29:23.161
Hey, I didn't see your
name on the petition.

29:23.194 --> 29:25.630
- What gives?
- Oh, uh...

29:25.664 --> 29:28.634
maybe I don't agree with Frank.

29:28.666 --> 29:31.035
- Really?
- What did I miss?

29:31.069 --> 29:32.671
Oh, just guy stuff.

29:32.703 --> 29:34.205
Baseball, Ava Gardner, you know?

29:34.239 --> 29:36.809
Oh, well, speaking of Mickey Rooney,

29:36.841 --> 29:40.078
another toast to our newly
minted star of the stage.

29:40.111 --> 29:41.813
- Yeah. Hear, hear.
- Oh.

29:41.847 --> 29:43.682
Thank you.

29:43.714 --> 29:45.317
Do you guys, uh... do you guys think

29:45.349 --> 29:47.218
that Gilbert and Sullivan were racialists?

29:47.251 --> 29:49.024
No, just different times.

29:49.059 --> 29:52.124
Are there any good geishas in the chorus?

29:52.156 --> 29:54.489
Wait till they hear that
plummy baritone of yours, huh?

29:54.524 --> 29:56.828
Jimmy, I've never heard you sing.

29:56.861 --> 29:59.194
That's a crime. Will you, please?

29:59.229 --> 30:02.367
- Oh, yeah. Sing. Sing.
- I couldn't possibly.

30:02.401 --> 30:04.336
- Okay!
- Come here, wife.

30:04.368 --> 30:06.038
- Oh. Oh.
- Sit. Sit.

30:06.070 --> 30:07.384
Could do that for you here.

30:07.419 --> 30:09.340
It's in the key of A. ( blows )

30:09.374 --> 30:11.242
Whoa. Watch where you point that A.

30:11.276 --> 30:13.278
This is my wife.

30:13.310 --> 30:15.780

30:37.469 --> 30:39.205
We'll see you tomorrow.

30:45.476 --> 30:46.778
Glass of water?

30:49.380 --> 30:52.417
Glass of anything. I'm at your mercy.

30:58.389 --> 31:00.425
This used to be the Winters' palace, no?

31:00.459 --> 31:03.095
- Mm.
- Yeah.

31:03.127 --> 31:06.197
You've certainly warmed the place up.

31:18.831 --> 31:21.146
- Cheers.
- Mm.

31:21.443 --> 31:22.545
( glasses clink )

31:25.015 --> 31:26.418
I know what you're doing.

31:28.850 --> 31:30.381
Line 135.

31:33.436 --> 31:35.194
I haven't the foggiest idea what you mean.

31:35.229 --> 31:37.162
Sorry.

31:37.194 --> 31:40.064
Wait, your scheduled calls.

31:40.098 --> 31:42.233
Clicks and clacks.

31:42.267 --> 31:44.870
Mrs. Isaacs, the clicks
and clacks are technical.

31:44.903 --> 31:48.373
They're rather tedious, I'm
afraid. It's part of the work.

31:48.405 --> 31:50.700
The telephone isn't just for
gossip and grocery lists, you know?

31:50.735 --> 31:53.345
- I'm not sure what Constance has told you.
- So, you do know Constance?

31:53.377 --> 31:55.098
- Well, of course, uh...
- Of-Of course you know her.

31:55.133 --> 31:57.181
She connects your calls every day.

31:57.214 --> 31:58.919
And what are the chances of that, I wonder.

31:58.954 --> 32:01.595
- She's not assigned to that line.
- I misspoke.

32:01.630 --> 32:04.005
When you were writing
sonnets with your tongue.

32:05.666 --> 32:08.460
There's no record of those
calls in the logbooks.

32:08.492 --> 32:11.797
Even Dr. Oppenheimer's calls are logged.

32:11.829 --> 32:14.165
Mrs. Isaacs... Abby... sorry, if I may,

32:14.198 --> 32:17.044
if you think I've done something
wrong, why lure me here?

32:17.079 --> 32:19.471
Am I to, what, confess?

32:19.503 --> 32:23.074
Is Inspector Lestrade going
to jump out, pistol drawn?

32:30.878 --> 32:32.350
I don't mean to sound flip.

32:32.384 --> 32:33.919
( clears throat )

32:35.757 --> 32:37.326
Truth is you've caught me.

32:39.176 --> 32:41.779
I'm on a mission...

32:41.814 --> 32:43.083
of vengeance.

32:44.642 --> 32:47.162
Not that she seems to
have noticed, of course.

32:48.708 --> 32:50.031
Constance?

32:52.392 --> 32:54.494
Helen Prins.

32:55.524 --> 32:56.744
And I won't pretend that you don't know

32:56.779 --> 32:59.243
what she did to both of us.

32:59.277 --> 33:01.805
Switchboard girl knows everything.

33:01.840 --> 33:04.382
Where your husband was
last evening, for example.

33:07.721 --> 33:08.823
Ah...

33:09.829 --> 33:11.098
you didn't know.

33:14.662 --> 33:16.725
Well, seems that he and Helen

33:16.760 --> 33:19.064
have fallen back into one another's orbit.

33:23.045 --> 33:24.881
I'm so sorry.

33:26.860 --> 33:29.712
Marriage is a bit of business
in this part of the world.

33:29.747 --> 33:32.610
I mean, ask Constance's husband.

33:32.644 --> 33:35.443
I'm not proud.

33:35.478 --> 33:38.416
But I'm baffled, frankly, by your husband.

33:38.450 --> 33:42.421
How he manages to keep straying
so far afield with you at home?

33:47.399 --> 33:48.562
These great minds...

33:48.597 --> 33:51.830
and I'm not one, I don't flatter myself...

33:53.498 --> 33:56.568
they're quite mad, you know?

33:56.600 --> 33:59.588
Always chasing after the invisible.

33:59.623 --> 34:02.373
And they're missing what's
right in front of them.

34:14.061 --> 34:16.030
<i>( door opens )</i>

34:18.271 --> 34:21.717
Dr. Crosley just helped
me... he gave me a ride home.

34:24.922 --> 34:27.058
I heard you dried out, Paul.

34:27.364 --> 34:29.216
Right, yes.

34:29.251 --> 34:31.469
Gosh, I knew I'd forgotten something.

34:31.502 --> 34:34.106
- Thank you, Mrs. Isaacs.
- Thank you.

34:38.085 --> 34:39.717
Mr. Isaacs.

34:52.389 --> 34:55.127
<i>( counter clicking )</i>

35:13.280 --> 35:14.819
86.

35:20.551 --> 35:21.997
<i>( clicking continues )</i>

35:22.032 --> 35:23.794
<i>87.</i>

35:23.829 --> 35:25.382
<i>Well, look at the bright side...</i>

35:25.417 --> 35:27.725
<i>if you poke the dragon,
we boil together.</i>

35:27.758 --> 35:29.081
Stop it. Stop talking.

35:29.116 --> 35:33.030
You know, there were times
that I envied the spies.

35:33.064 --> 35:34.566
They never worked alone.

35:34.598 --> 35:37.068
<i>Rendezvouses, meetings,
signals, betrayals...</i>

35:37.102 --> 35:39.071
<i>one big, happy family.</i>

35:39.104 --> 35:40.705
- Wanna hear a joke?
- No.

35:40.738 --> 35:42.307
How do you catch a Communist?

35:42.339 --> 35:44.376
Hold a meeting.

35:44.408 --> 35:47.044
Not a joke, actually, a real tactic.

35:47.077 --> 35:49.080
The FBI... a bunch of amateurs...

35:49.113 --> 35:52.016
but even they know how
to read a hotel registry

35:52.050 --> 35:54.482
or a passenger manifest.

35:54.517 --> 35:56.754
Or a petition.

35:56.787 --> 36:00.562
The best blacklists, Frank,
are the ones the traitors sign

36:00.597 --> 36:03.529
all by themselves.

36:07.358 --> 36:10.171
Darrow wanted to see
who signed the petition

36:10.206 --> 36:13.110
so... so he could use it against us.

36:13.145 --> 36:14.962
And you thought I abused my badge.

36:14.997 --> 36:16.640
Devil you knew.

36:16.673 --> 36:20.010
<i>( clicking continues )</i>

36:20.045 --> 36:22.613
Where do you think you're going, Frank?

36:22.647 --> 36:24.024
Do you think those fellas out there

36:24.059 --> 36:26.024
are going to let you go back?

36:26.059 --> 36:29.521
With Bush in town and all
this work here left to do?

36:29.553 --> 36:32.156
Sorry, Cinderella, no ball for you.

36:35.523 --> 36:37.358
<i>Now, Frank,</i>

36:37.492 --> 36:40.155
now, that might be the worst
idea you've had all year,

36:40.231 --> 36:41.475
and that is saying something.

36:41.510 --> 36:43.635
What, poke the dragon, get a sick-out?

36:43.667 --> 36:45.537
<i>Medical evacuation back to the Hill?</i>

36:45.569 --> 36:47.738
Save the day? No.

36:47.772 --> 36:50.342
No, Frank, no. Don't, don't, don't, don't.

36:50.374 --> 36:53.480
Frank, don't.

36:57.281 --> 36:59.846
Hey, the, eh... Jesus, Frank. Every
time you nudge the thing,

36:59.881 --> 37:02.753
the temperature jumps
another three degrees.

37:02.787 --> 37:04.911
90!

37:04.946 --> 37:06.450
<i>93!</i>

37:06.485 --> 37:07.825
97!

37:07.859 --> 37:08.936
( beeping )

37:08.971 --> 37:12.297
Oh, shit, let's go.

37:12.330 --> 37:14.665
This is it. Come on, guys, go!

37:14.698 --> 37:16.434
( grunting )

37:19.504 --> 37:22.274
( panting )

37:27.274 --> 37:29.210
What was that, 99%?

37:31.133 --> 37:32.578
<i>Get the car.</i>

37:38.305 --> 37:40.876
Morning. Thank you.

38:03.038 --> 38:04.880
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

38:09.037 --> 38:11.813
- Where's Frank Winter, please?
- This is his room.

38:26.809 --> 38:29.245
Get the staff...

38:29.504 --> 38:30.973
all of them.

38:39.711 --> 38:42.542
Colonel, may we have a word in private?

38:43.638 --> 38:45.540
My office.

38:50.423 --> 38:54.362
I'm sorry to interrupt you, sir,
but I have something to report.

38:57.185 --> 38:59.844
I... I work the switchboard, you know.

38:59.879 --> 39:01.525
Well, of course you know,

39:01.560 --> 39:06.028
and, um, sometimes we hear things.

39:06.060 --> 39:08.704
Paul Crosley... Dr. Crosley.

39:10.178 --> 39:12.665
Well, I had to employ

39:12.700 --> 39:15.447
some fairly unorthodox tactics

39:15.482 --> 39:16.655
to draw him out.

39:16.690 --> 39:20.419
But he and Constance Faraday,
our new British transfer,

39:20.454 --> 39:23.389
are involved in something
with the telephone,

39:23.424 --> 39:25.480
line 135, every day like clockwork

39:25.513 --> 39:28.836
with some kind of signal on the other line.

39:28.871 --> 39:31.419
Thank you, Mrs. Isaacs.

39:31.452 --> 39:35.290
America is strongest when
her citizens do their duty.

39:39.809 --> 39:42.077
Well...

39:42.165 --> 39:46.289
all right, then. Thank you, sir.

39:48.352 --> 39:51.842
- I was so glad to see you at the Seder.
- Yes.

39:51.877 --> 39:55.176
This Hill suffers from a lack
of faith, you may have noticed.

39:55.209 --> 39:58.513
- I blame all the scientists.
- So do I.

40:00.160 --> 40:03.597
We have such great need of
faith in these difficult times.

40:05.810 --> 40:07.978
Yes.

40:08.034 --> 40:10.069
Yes. It's...

40:10.104 --> 40:14.590
been a very hard year
with the war and the camp.

40:14.625 --> 40:16.060
And the baby.

40:18.633 --> 40:21.510
- Yes.
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you.

40:21.545 --> 40:24.205
No, you didn't really. It's, um...

40:24.238 --> 40:26.663
I... I... I can't hear it again.

40:26.698 --> 40:29.868
<i>Hear what?</i>

40:30.104 --> 40:33.941
That these things just happen.

40:34.302 --> 40:36.604
And that there's no reason for it.

40:38.318 --> 40:41.722
Of course there's a reason.

40:41.756 --> 40:44.225
You're in pain.

40:44.258 --> 40:45.559
Don't fight it.

40:45.593 --> 40:47.729
Pain is His voice,

40:47.761 --> 40:50.041
reminding you that you're alive

40:50.076 --> 40:52.316
and at His mercy.

40:52.351 --> 40:53.898
In difficult times most of all,

40:53.933 --> 40:56.070
His voice is everywhere.

40:59.189 --> 41:02.875
My wife was thrown through
the windshield of a car.

41:02.910 --> 41:05.312
- Oh...
- She lived, Mrs. Isaacs.

41:05.345 --> 41:07.882
And her pain is constant

41:08.007 --> 41:09.788
for a reason.

41:11.140 --> 41:13.476
We can know His reason

41:13.626 --> 41:15.796
if we have the strength to listen.

41:18.125 --> 41:21.129
Will you?

41:21.396 --> 41:22.731
Listen?

41:24.566 --> 41:25.801
With me?

42:04.372 --> 42:07.274
( knocks )

42:07.307 --> 42:10.545
Sir? M.I.T. is landing.

42:24.191 --> 42:26.888
<i>( overlapping chatter )</i>

42:26.993 --> 42:30.163
We're all here for a reason.

42:30.365 --> 42:31.375
We're all here for a reason.

42:31.410 --> 42:34.581
<i>We all know what that reason is.</i>

42:34.935 --> 42:38.272
<i>To drop an atomic weapon
on a Japanese city,</i>

42:38.305 --> 42:40.911
<i>killing 30 to 50 thousand people.</i>

42:41.004 --> 42:44.753
Mostly civilians, women and children.

42:49.350 --> 42:52.254
If that's not why you're here,

42:52.287 --> 42:54.656
you're in the wrong room.

42:54.689 --> 42:57.359
If you thought you were racing
the Nazis to a super weapon,

42:57.392 --> 43:00.794
your ignorance has been engineered.

43:00.827 --> 43:02.671
You've been sold a comic book.

43:02.706 --> 43:04.441
Charlie: <i>Frank?</i>

43:06.211 --> 43:08.346
There is no German bomb.

43:08.535 --> 43:10.283
The Army has known that for a long time

43:10.318 --> 43:12.561
and so has Dr. Isaacs.

43:14.876 --> 43:19.090
Is there a German bomb, Dr. Isaacs?

43:23.450 --> 43:26.353
- I don't know.
- You don't know.

43:26.386 --> 43:29.557
- And how long have you not known?
- <i>It doesn't matter.</i>

43:29.591 --> 43:31.826
The gadget is gonna end this war.

43:31.859 --> 43:34.037
It's gonna save lives.

43:34.072 --> 43:35.413
Hitler is finished.

43:35.448 --> 43:37.899
Every industrial center
in Germany is an ash heap.

43:37.932 --> 43:40.202
The Russians are rolling in.

43:40.234 --> 43:42.437
Yet I haven't noticed
a second sun over Moscow

43:42.470 --> 43:45.540
or Stalingrad or London, have you?

43:45.573 --> 43:47.943
What does that tell you as a scientist?

43:53.281 --> 43:56.251
Ignorance is forgivable.

43:56.283 --> 43:59.253
It's what comes next that is not.

44:00.854 --> 44:02.790
Less than a quarter of
you signed this petition.

44:02.823 --> 44:04.693
I don't blame anybody who didn't.

44:04.725 --> 44:09.396
For one thing, I've been a son of a bitch.

44:09.430 --> 44:12.667
I've disrespected half
the people in this room.

44:15.970 --> 44:17.571
A lot of you have good reasons

44:17.604 --> 44:21.008
not to put your names on something I wrote.

44:21.042 --> 44:24.412
For another thing...

44:24.444 --> 44:28.249
this petition...

44:28.283 --> 44:30.352
this petition is a blacklist.

44:32.653 --> 44:35.784
Anybody know the half-life of an FBI file?

44:37.057 --> 44:40.517
It's longer than any of our natural lives.

44:41.210 --> 44:41.915
Heaven.

44:41.950 --> 44:45.582
They've been using me to divide us.

44:45.617 --> 44:47.654
But instead...

44:47.707 --> 44:51.445
instead we're going to surprise them.

44:51.571 --> 44:54.376
All of us or none.

44:54.408 --> 44:57.711
F.D.R.'s scientific
advisor is here on the Hill.

44:57.745 --> 45:01.069
This is our last chance to
send the president a message.

45:01.120 --> 45:04.884
They can build this bomb without...
without statesmen, without generals,

45:04.919 --> 45:07.346
but they can't build it without us.

45:07.404 --> 45:08.789
So I'm...

45:08.865 --> 45:12.436
I'm gonna walk out the door right now.

45:12.627 --> 45:15.430
I'm probably gonna wind up in the brig.

45:15.463 --> 45:18.667
But I'm asking you to follow me.

45:18.700 --> 45:20.769
If you believe we have
a moral responsibility

45:20.801 --> 45:24.506
for the future of what we
are building here, follow me.

45:24.539 --> 45:27.464
If you believe Japan deserves
whatever it gets, follow me.

45:27.499 --> 45:29.911
Follow me no matter what you
believe so long as you believe

45:29.943 --> 45:32.376
the scientists who designed this gadget

45:32.411 --> 45:36.068
should have some say in how it is used!

45:40.088 --> 45:44.825
All of us or none.

45:44.859 --> 45:49.531
But any ignorance from
here on out is willful.

45:51.899 --> 45:53.702
And won't be forgiven.

45:53.734 --> 45:56.570
Not by any God worth inventing.

45:56.604 --> 45:59.573
Not by any democracy worth fighting for.

46:09.450 --> 46:11.520
( murmuring )

47:18.019 --> 47:20.722
( whispers ) Sir, the president is dead.

48:10.136 --> 48:14.278
Man on radio: <i>We interrupt this
program with a "World News" update.</i>

48:14.365 --> 48:17.143
<i>President Roosevelt has died.</i>

48:17.178 --> 48:21.115
<i>Reports have emerged suggesting
he suffered a cerebral hemorrhage.</i>

48:21.147 --> 48:23.017
<i>The president was
sitting for a portrait</i>

48:23.050 --> 48:26.220
<i>when he complained of
a "terrific headache."</i>

48:28.155 --> 48:29.823
<i>Vice President Harry S. Truman</i>

48:29.858 --> 48:31.658
<i>received the news at the Capitol,</i>

48:31.691 --> 48:34.884
<i>whereupon the Secret Service
rushed him to the White House</i>

48:34.919 --> 48:37.890
<i>and he was sworn in by
Chief Justice Harlan Stone.</i>

48:39.834 --> 48:43.004
Man #2: <i>He has been one of the
greatest leaders of this country.</i>

48:43.037 --> 48:46.006
<i>He has been one of the
greatest leaders of humanity.</i>

48:46.039 --> 48:49.643
<i>And his name will be left
to us as a lover of men,</i>

48:49.676 --> 48:51.745
<i>as a servant of their freedom,</i>

48:51.778 --> 48:54.081
<i>and as a wise and patient leader</i>

48:54.115 --> 48:57.651
<i>in the greatest war
ever fought for freedom.</i>

48:57.685 --> 48:59.114
Man: <i>What we know at this hour</i>

48:59.149 --> 49:01.559
<i>is that the president
died at his home</i>

49:01.594 --> 49:03.857
<i>in Warm Springs, Georgia.</i>

49:03.890 --> 49:06.660
Man #2: <i>Mr. Roosevelt
has piloted the nation,</i>

49:06.693 --> 49:10.406
<i>if not through victory, to
within sight of victory.</i>

49:10.441 --> 49:12.966
<i>Lincoln's death removed
him from leadership</i>

49:12.999 --> 49:15.202
<i>in the time of Reconstruction.</i>

49:15.236 --> 49:17.869
<i>President Roosevelt's
death has removed him</i>

49:17.904 --> 49:20.941
<i>from the greatest
task ever faced by men</i>

49:20.975 --> 49:23.745
<i>of making peace and
building a secure</i>

49:23.778 --> 49:25.780
<i>and neighborly world.</i>
