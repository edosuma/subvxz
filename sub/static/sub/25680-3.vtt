She's doing a segment about a being a
guest at a fancy dinner.

11:46.790 --> 11:51.086
Nice! I've got two outfits that I think
are perfect for a fancy dinner.

11:53.963 --> 11:56.925
Now, I like the astronaut suit
because the sleeves are missing,

11:57.008 --> 11:59.469
but the cowboy outfit
has got a sheriff's badge,

11:59.552 --> 12:01.888
and that's an unexpected twist.

12:03.139 --> 12:04.683
You're fun.

12:05.892 --> 12:08.728
Either one will be great
for Amelia's new brand.

12:08.812 --> 12:11.815
Uh, wait. What do you mean "new brand"?

12:11.898 --> 12:15.610
Amelia's show now celebrates people's
flaws and imperfections.

12:15.694 --> 12:17.946
That's why you're a perfect guest.

12:19.239 --> 12:20.615
Flaws and imperfections?

12:20.699 --> 12:23.076
You know, like intense upper-lip sweat.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.014
See you tonight.

12:47.017 --> 12:49.644
Wait. So the only reason
Amelia wants me on her show

12:49.728 --> 12:52.147
is because she thinks I'm uncool?

12:52.230 --> 12:54.357
No! No, I'm cool.
Right, Horse Face Guy?

13:03.158 --> 13:05.118

You know, the louder you say it,

13:54.959 --> 13:58.129
the less cool you seem to be keeping it.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.091
'Cause this is not cool!

14:01.174 --> 14:03.510
The music is too loud!
There are too many people!

how to use a coaster!

thrown that party.

ever since you called us moms.

17:10.905 --> 17:13.033

is really, really not perfect.

So, to celebrate all of our flaws,

17:25.837 --> 17:31.134

flawed guest, Bernie Schotz.

I'm just excited to have an elegant
dinner with my dear friend.

17:54.449 --> 17:56.743
I'm talking too much.
Please, lead the conversation.

17:57.869 --> 18:01.456
Okay, I don't know why you
haven't tripped over yourself

18:01.539 --> 18:02.707
or broken anything yet,

18:02.791 --> 18:06.002
but let's bring out the messy food

18:06.086 --> 18:08.797
and use this
expensive glassware,

18:08.922 --> 18:12.676
and I'm sure the real Bernie Schotz
will make an appearance.

18:17.263 --> 18:19.099
Okay, Bernie,

18:19.182 --> 18:22.560
that's a big plate
of red, sloppy spaghetti.

18:22.644 --> 18:23.478
Dig in,

18:23.561 --> 18:27.107
and don't worry about being perfect.

18:34.155 --> 18:36.157
Ooh! Yum!

18:38.201 --> 18:40.412
This reminds me of my last trip to Italy.

18:40.495 --> 18:41.830
[speaking in Italian]

18:45.959 --> 18:49.337
Okay, those were obviously
just random words.

18:49.421 --> 18:53.008
What did you say?
"Ice cream, donkey, suspender teeth"?

18:54.801 --> 18:58.054
He actually said,
"The sun in Tuscany shines like gold."

18:58.138 --> 19:00.724
And his pronunciation was flawless.

19:02.892 --> 19:05.103

19:31.254 --> 19:33.590

19:33.673 --> 19:35.300

19:35.383 --> 19:37.260
and for me to say, "That's okay.
Flaws are fine."
