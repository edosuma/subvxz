01:42.317 --> 01:45.150
[Minnie]
Hi everybody! When our story began,

01:45.233 --> 01:49.317
Mickey was decorating the Clubhouse
for a special Clubhouse Day celebration

01:49.400 --> 01:50.692
for all our friends.

01:51.108 --> 01:54.900
But the party was interrupted
by a great whirling wind.

01:55.275 --> 01:57.733
Pluto and I took shelter
in the Shoe Garage,

01:57.817 --> 02:01.108
but the wind was too strong
and it carried us away.

02:01.858 --> 02:04.358
We landed safely in the Land of Dizz

02:04.733 --> 02:06.817
and met Good Witch Clarabelle.

02:07.108 --> 02:10.775
She gave me a pair of magic shoes
and told us to journey

02:10.858 --> 02:14.192
to the City of Handy Helpers
to meet the Wizard of Dizz.

02:14.650 --> 02:18.650
She also told us
to beware of Bad Witch Pete

02:18.733 --> 02:21.025
who wanted my magic shoes for himself.

02:22.275 --> 02:26.192
Along the way Pluto and I
met some wonderful new friends.

Scarecrow Goofy, who needs a brain,

02:29.525 --> 02:31.733

02:32.025 --> 02:35.858
and Donald the Lion,
who wants to be King of the Jungle.

Together we're going
to the City of Handy Helpers

02:39.400 --> 02:41.817

03:12.442 --> 03:14.817
[Goofy] I don't see a wizard anywhere.

03:19.483 --> 03:24.150
[Von Drake] Who is coming to visit
the amazing Wizard of Dizz?

03:24.900 --> 03:26.650
And what do you want?

03:28.483 --> 03:30.442
Uh... How do you do?

03:32.983 --> 03:36.192
I'm Minnie Mouse.
I came to ask for your help,

03:36.275 --> 03:38.983
so Pluto and I can go back home
to the clubhouse.

03:39.067 --> 03:40.983

I'm Scarecrow Goofy,

I'm Mickey the Tin Mouse,

and a jungle and a lion and a thing. Ooh.

04:07.483 --> 04:10.317
You people are asking a lot
from the Wizard.

04:10.400 --> 04:13.108
I don't know about if I can help you.

04:13.733 --> 04:17.442
Oh, such a sad face you got. Boo-hoo.

04:17.733 --> 04:19.733
I tell you what we're going to do.

04:19.817 --> 04:23.650
I will going to help you
if you prove your courage

04:23.733 --> 04:26.650
and meet the Wiz of Dizz challenge.

04:27.233 --> 04:30.900
We have courage. What's your challenge?

04:31.233 --> 04:35.317
All right. Bring me back Witch Pete's hat.

04:35.775 --> 04:36.775
What?

04:37.067 --> 04:38.817
The witch's hat?

04:38.900 --> 04:40.483
You got to be kidding.

04:40.983 --> 04:45.067
It's no joke.
Without the magic power of his hat,

04:45.150 --> 04:49.233
Witch Pete can't be a bad
and sneaky witch anymore.

Goodbye now, toodle-loo. Over and out.

04:53.858 --> 04:56.525
Oh, no, what should we do now?

04:56.942 --> 04:58.900
There's only one thing to do.

04:58.983 --> 05:02.650
We've got to go to Witch Pete's castle
and ask him for his hat.

I really like those sparkly shoes.

Why don't you let me try them on
for size? Pretty please?

06:04.317 --> 06:08.817
Okay, Witch Pete,
as long as I can borrow your hat.

06:09.483 --> 06:11.400
Oh! My hat?

06:11.858 --> 06:12.858
Uh-huh.

06:13.275 --> 06:18.108
Well, I don't know about that.
I'll have to think it over.

06:18.192 --> 06:19.858
Okay, you got a deal. Give me the shoes.

06:21.858 --> 06:24.275
Now you can take a few steps,

06:24.358 --> 06:27.942
but then you've got to give them
back to me. Promise?

06:28.233 --> 06:30.192
Oh, yes, yes, of course. Sure, sure, sure.

06:30.275 --> 06:32.192
I mean it, promise.

06:32.525 --> 06:36.400
I promise on Coco's whiskers.

06:36.525 --> 06:37.525
Ook?

Ooh-hoo-hoo! [humming]

06:42.192 --> 06:43.900
The shoes are mine!

06:43.983 --> 06:46.983
Now I have a magic hat and magic shoes.

06:47.067 --> 06:49.233
And I'm keeping them both.

06:49.567 --> 06:51.108
Eek! Ook!

06:51.233 --> 06:54.150
But you promised. We had a deal.

06:54.483 --> 06:56.775
Not anymore. [cackles]

06:57.025 --> 07:00.900
Oh, you really are a bad and sneaky witch.

07:00.983 --> 07:02.775
What can we do?

07:03.317 --> 07:06.692
Maybe a Mouseketool
can help us get Witch Pete's hat.

07:08.275 --> 07:09.942

All we've got left are the beach towel

07:22.525 --> 07:24.483
and the Mystery Mouseketool.

07:25.317 --> 07:26.942
[Minnie] Well, the beach towel

07:27.025 --> 07:29.358

going to help us?

forgot about me.

14:13.317 --> 14:15.442

Yeah, what about them?

15:19.733 --> 15:22.775
Well, how are they going to get back
to the clubhouse?

15:24.025 --> 15:26.983
Good Witch Clarabelle said
these shoes could help me.

15:27.358 --> 15:31.400
Wow-wee! Those really
are nice shoes you got there,

15:31.483 --> 15:34.483
but I don't know a thing about them.
[laughs]

15:34.567 --> 15:37.358
What I do know is that
to get back to the clubhouse,

15:37.442 --> 15:39.900
you going to need to cross over
a great desert.

15:40.358 --> 15:42.942
Because when I first arrived
in the Land of Dizz,

15:43.275 --> 15:47.317
I flew over that very desert
in a glove balloon.

15:47.817 --> 15:49.358
A glove balloon?

15:49.442 --> 15:52.733
Yes! Follow me and I will show you.

15:58.900 --> 16:01.483
All right, here it is.

16:01.858 --> 16:05.900
Look at that, there's a great big hole
in the pinkie finger.

16:06.692 --> 16:09.983
This is more of a floppy leotard
than a balloon.

16:11.733 --> 16:13.983
Maybe there's a Mouseketool
that can help us.

16:14.067 --> 16:15.317
Everybody say,

16:15.400 --> 16:17.275
[sing-song] "Oh, Woodles!"

16:17.733 --> 16:20.192
[sing-song] Oh, Woodles!

16:21.067 --> 16:22.400
[bell rings]

16:27.275 --> 16:31.233
[Minnie] Oh, look, our last Mouseketool
is the pink beach towel.

16:31.525 --> 16:34.775
Can the beach towel help us patch
the glove balloon and fix it?

16:36.817 --> 16:38.317
Let's find out.

16:39.942 --> 16:42.025
We've picked all our Mouseketools.

16:42.442 --> 16:44.567
Say, "Super Cheers!"

16:50.692 --> 16:54.150
Whoop-de-do!
The glove balloon is ready to go.

16:59.858 --> 17:01.275
[Clarabelle] Whoo!

17:01.358 --> 17:02.567
Ooh!

17:02.650 --> 17:03.858
[grunts]

17:04.233 --> 17:05.942
[chuckles]

17:06.025 --> 17:08.067
Oh, my goodness, that was fun.

17:08.733 --> 17:10.358
Good Witch Clarabelle.

17:10.650 --> 17:12.108
Hello, my dear.

17:12.192 --> 17:14.608
I see that you have
the Wizard's glove balloon

17:14.692 --> 17:16.358
to take you back home.

17:17.608 --> 17:19.775
Come along now, Minnie, hurry up.

17:19.858 --> 17:24.275
Okay, [gasps] but where's Pluto?
I can't leave without him.

17:25.275 --> 17:28.983
[barks]

17:29.067 --> 17:30.983
-Pluto.
-[all] Pluto.

17:31.067 --> 17:32.900
-[Goofy] Come here, boy.
-[Pete] Pluto.

17:32.983 --> 17:35.775
-[barking]
-[Minnie] Pluto, come here.

17:36.150 --> 17:37.358
[barks]

17:37.442 --> 17:38.858
[howling]

17:38.942 --> 17:41.192
Good boy, Pluto, come on.

17:41.275 --> 17:43.525
It's time for us to go back
to the clubhouse.

17:46.400 --> 17:47.400
[grunts]

17:50.192 --> 17:52.400
Whoa! There goes the glove balloon.

17:52.733 --> 17:56.608
Oh! Wait, come back, we want to go, too.

17:56.692 --> 18:00.483
I can't stop the balloon.
Sorry about that, Minnie.

18:00.900 --> 18:05.442
Bye-bye. Don't forget to write.
Send a postcard.

18:06.483 --> 18:07.817
Oh, Pluto,

18:07.900 --> 18:11.108
now how are we going to get back
to the clubhouse? [sobs]

18:11.192 --> 18:13.233
That balloon was our last chance.

18:13.567 --> 18:16.983
I'm afraid we'll never see
our clubhouse friends again.

18:17.067 --> 18:18.233
[whimpers]

18:18.317 --> 18:22.233
Oh, don't worry, Minnie,
I have some good news for you.

18:22.608 --> 18:25.942
I finally remembered
what I forgot to remember.

18:26.275 --> 18:28.692
I know how those magic shoes work.

18:29.817 --> 18:31.067
How?

18:31.150 --> 18:35.525
All you need to do is make a wish
and tap a little dance.

18:36.317 --> 18:41.817
[musical notes playing]

18:41.900 --> 18:45.400
And the shoes will take you
wherever you want to go.

18:45.942 --> 18:47.692
Really?

18:47.775 --> 18:53.067
Then Pluto and I can go back home
to the clubhouse. Oh.

18:53.692 --> 18:56.150
But I'm going to miss
all of my new friends.

18:56.692 --> 19:01.067
Aw. Don't worry, Minnie,
you'll always be in my heart.

19:01.358 --> 19:04.692
And you'll always be in the thoughts
inside my brain.

19:06.150 --> 19:09.525
We'll celebrate the day we met you.

19:09.942 --> 19:12.983
Yeah, we'll celebrate the day we met you,

19:13.067 --> 19:15.608
and I promise to be as nice as...

19:16.150 --> 19:18.817
Well, as nice as you, Minnie.

19:20.108 --> 19:24.108
Oh, thank you, thank you.
You're all so wonderful.

19:24.483 --> 19:26.525
And I'll never ever forget you.

19:40.483 --> 19:44.108
Well, goodbye, everybody, goodbye.

19:44.650 --> 19:46.358
Goodbye, my dear.

19:46.442 --> 19:49.608
Now make your wish
and do the special tap dance.

19:50.775 --> 19:54.275
I wish we could go back home
to the clubhouse.
