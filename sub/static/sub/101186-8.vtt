WEBVTT

00:07.708 --> 00:09.142
‐ Where are you from, Charlie?

00:09.176 --> 00:11.512
‐ All I wanna do is help people.
‐ He's not Charlie.

00:11.545 --> 00:12.813
He's Julian. He's my father.

00:12.846 --> 00:14.982
I am a fully grown half angel.

00:15.015 --> 00:16.517
‐ Are you real?

00:16.550 --> 00:17.718
‐ To Nicole and Waverly.

00:17.751 --> 00:19.753
‐ The only problem
you really have

00:19.786 --> 00:20.821
is people adore you.

00:20.854 --> 00:23.023
‐ Too busy to celebrate
your sisters' engagement?

00:23.056 --> 00:25.826
‐ Well, slap my ass and call me
the sister‐in‐law.

00:25.859 --> 00:27.661
‐ Jeremy, where is Robin?

00:27.694 --> 00:29.229
‐ Just keep him out
of this, okay?

00:29.263 --> 00:31.231
‐ Time's up, beast.
‐ You found your gun.

00:31.265 --> 00:32.733
I thought you wanted
to kill me.

00:32.766 --> 00:36.136
‐ All I want is to stop feeling
guilty for what I am.

00:38.405 --> 00:41.174
(soft eerie music)

00:55.589 --> 00:58.625
‐ Why is there a breeze
all up in my kitchen?

01:00.060 --> 01:02.062
Where am I?

01:04.898 --> 01:06.633
Oh no, I didn't.

01:09.603 --> 01:11.872
Good morning.

01:11.905 --> 01:16.109
Good "morgen",
as they say in Germany.

01:16.910 --> 01:20.380
Just curious if anybody
has seen...

01:20.414 --> 01:23.050
a pair of...

01:23.083 --> 01:25.485
leather pants?

01:25.519 --> 01:27.087
Black leather pants?

01:27.120 --> 01:28.755
(clearing throat)

01:28.789 --> 01:30.490
(grunting)

01:32.759 --> 01:34.428
‐ Wynonna!

01:34.928 --> 01:36.697
You're still here.

01:37.664 --> 01:39.066
Well...

01:39.099 --> 01:41.234
Happy Halloween to me.

01:41.902 --> 01:43.770
‐ Prick or treat.

01:43.804 --> 01:46.707
‐ Let me help you to the street.

01:47.941 --> 01:49.910
Let's get you up.

01:49.943 --> 01:51.778
‐ This boa's just
chaffing my vag.

01:51.812 --> 01:54.147
Hang on. Please, thank you.

01:55.749 --> 01:57.918
‐ It was a treat.

01:57.951 --> 01:59.920
And let me say,

01:59.953 --> 02:01.922
if you were thinking
of Doc the whole time,

02:01.955 --> 02:04.124
it's okay, because I know I was.

02:05.559 --> 02:08.295
‐ I'd just back off a tidge
if I were you.

02:08.862 --> 02:11.832
Remember the time I got
my demon‐killing gun back?

02:11.865 --> 02:13.700
(chuckling)

02:18.972 --> 02:20.807
(suspenseful music)

02:20.841 --> 02:23.043
‐ You're going to need it.

02:28.982 --> 02:31.885
(whistling)
‐ Evans! Keep it quiet!

02:31.918 --> 02:33.620
‐ There's nothing out here, man.

02:33.654 --> 02:34.955
‐ You remember last year?

02:34.988 --> 02:36.790
Eyes open.

02:36.823 --> 02:40.093
(insects chirping,
crows cawing)

02:42.596 --> 02:44.965
(suspenseful music)

02:44.998 --> 02:48.368
(metal clinking)

02:48.402 --> 02:50.604
(creaking)

02:52.706 --> 02:53.940
(thudding)

02:53.974 --> 02:56.043
Did you hear that?

02:58.845 --> 03:00.447
‐ Do you see that?

03:00.480 --> 03:02.983
Put your hands on your...
pumpkin!

03:03.016 --> 03:04.418
(high‐pitched giggling)

03:04.451 --> 03:06.720
‐ Fuck this, man,
I hate Halloween!

03:06.753 --> 03:08.755
(gunfire)

03:09.389 --> 03:10.757
(giggling)

03:11.992 --> 03:14.161
(shouting)

03:14.594 --> 03:16.463
(soft eerie music)

03:16.496 --> 03:17.764
(giggling)

03:22.035 --> 03:24.471
♪ 'Cause I gave you
all I got to give ♪

03:24.504 --> 03:27.140
♪ I know that ain't
no way to live ♪

03:27.174 --> 03:31.778
♪ I told that devil
to take you back ♪

03:32.579 --> 03:37.250
♪ I told that devil
to take you back ♪

03:41.722 --> 03:43.690
‐ Wow!

03:43.724 --> 03:47.661
You really smacked the Homestead
with the Halloween stick.

03:47.694 --> 03:49.329
And hard.
‐ Yeah.

03:49.362 --> 03:51.832
Let me tell you about Halloween
with my daddy.

03:53.066 --> 03:55.302
We'd cower in our rooms

03:55.335 --> 03:58.405
while Daddy sat on the porch
with his bourbon and guns,

03:58.438 --> 04:00.307
ranting about The Devil's Night.

04:00.340 --> 04:02.843
‐ Hey, well I'm glad
you're reclaiming it.

04:02.876 --> 04:04.377
‐ Yeah.

04:04.411 --> 04:06.046
I need some Earp sister time.

04:06.079 --> 04:08.348
Let her know that things
aren't gonna change

04:08.381 --> 04:10.050
just 'cause we're engaged.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.785
‐ Yeah. Well...

04:11.818 --> 04:13.286
except that next Halloween,

04:13.320 --> 04:16.790
I'm going to be
monster mashing my wife.

04:20.494 --> 04:22.028
‐ Have fun in the big city!

04:22.062 --> 04:24.598
‐ Ugh, shopping.

04:25.031 --> 04:27.033
But Rachel is insisting.

04:27.067 --> 04:30.070
Something about a white dress?

04:30.103 --> 04:31.872
‐ You know I'd be
perfectly happy

04:31.905 --> 04:34.074
if you wore your old Stetson.

04:34.107 --> 04:37.144
Maybe un‐retire the khakis?

04:38.779 --> 04:40.447
(phone chiming)

04:45.118 --> 04:47.187
Speaking of slacks:

04:47.220 --> 04:49.956
"Come to BBD. Bring pants."

04:49.990 --> 04:52.159
Is that code?

04:53.126 --> 04:54.861
‐ That's Wynonna.

05:00.634 --> 05:02.936
‐ Remember when you gave
that big speech to my boss

05:02.969 --> 05:04.404
about being
Wynonna Fucking Earp,

05:04.437 --> 05:07.240
demon‐hunting queen?
‐ How is Naomi?

05:07.274 --> 05:08.308
‐ She's on leave.

05:08.341 --> 05:09.276
‐ Since when?

05:09.309 --> 05:11.278
‐ Since she thought she saw
a baby Bigfoot

05:11.311 --> 05:12.312
and couldn't stop crying.

05:12.345 --> 05:13.980
Now her former assistant Albert

05:14.014 --> 05:15.448
is the boss of the whole...

05:15.482 --> 05:16.983
why are you wearing curtains?

05:17.017 --> 05:18.418
‐ Vagina curtains.

05:19.052 --> 05:20.821
Repurposed as my
Walk‐of‐Shame muumuu.

05:20.854 --> 05:24.057
‐ Wynonna, you haven't delivered
a supernatural bad guy

05:24.090 --> 05:25.325
in three weeks.

05:25.358 --> 05:27.928
‐ Tell me the truth,
did Naomi get guac'd?

05:27.961 --> 05:30.297
‐ Happy Halloween!

05:31.598 --> 05:34.000
Are you wearing... curtains?

05:34.034 --> 05:35.569
‐ Guys, I'm late.

05:35.602 --> 05:38.138
(sighing)
Let me introduce you

05:38.171 --> 05:40.340
to the perpetrator
of Purgatory's last

05:40.373 --> 05:42.909
Halloween massacre:
Te Deum Cleobis.

05:43.977 --> 05:45.145
‐ Rotten Jack!

05:45.178 --> 05:47.147
He's the reason we carve
Jack O'Lanterns.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.149
(deep voice): Once he begins
his slaughter,

05:49.182 --> 05:52.485
he does not stop until dawn!

05:52.519 --> 05:54.120
‐ He's killed twice today.

05:54.721 --> 05:56.690
Two good BBD agents
skewered too soon.

05:56.723 --> 05:58.291
‐ Peacemaker will mash him
into pie filling.

05:58.325 --> 06:00.093
‐ No, no. This is strictly
a no‐kill mission.

06:00.126 --> 06:01.294
BBD wants him alive.

06:01.328 --> 06:03.163
‐ Bu...
‐ Oh, no.

06:03.196 --> 06:05.398
Wynonna's not doing a mission.
Not today.

06:05.432 --> 06:07.133
No. We have Halloween plans!

06:07.167 --> 06:08.401
I just didn't tell you
about them yet.

06:08.435 --> 06:10.170
‐ You're gonna need to obtain
an extractor,

06:10.203 --> 06:12.038
paralyze Rotten Jack,
then deliver him to me.

06:12.072 --> 06:14.374
‐ What?
‐ You have three hours.

06:14.407 --> 06:16.443
‐ Uh...
‐ Or what?

06:19.679 --> 06:21.882
‐ Wait! You're not coming with?

06:21.915 --> 06:23.583
‐ I have an appointment.

06:24.551 --> 06:26.186
‐ Jesus.

06:26.219 --> 06:29.589
Who swapped his Snickers out
for a toothbrush?

06:30.423 --> 06:32.759
‐ So is Haught already
busy tonight or something?

06:32.792 --> 06:36.029
‐ No. I just want some time
with my sister.

06:36.062 --> 06:37.197
‐ Hmm.
‐ Hmm.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.032
Your costume.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.737
(gasps)
‐ C'mon Waves!

06:43.770 --> 06:45.872
As if I've been shaving
above the knee!

06:48.108 --> 06:50.210
(pop music)

06:50.243 --> 06:51.811
‐ I love Halloween.

06:57.550 --> 06:59.552
‐ On the house, Mr. Mercury.

06:59.586 --> 07:01.821
‐ Oh, much obliged.
Oh, and Kippy?

07:01.855 --> 07:05.125
This fell off the back
of a BBD supply truck.

07:05.158 --> 07:06.726
For your sciatica.

07:06.760 --> 07:09.963
Just a dab will do.
‐ You are a peach, Holliday.

07:09.996 --> 07:11.998
‐ I'm ready for you, Holliday.

07:12.032 --> 07:13.667
Now.

07:14.868 --> 07:17.470
(sighing)

07:20.040 --> 07:21.574
You're known to be a gambler.

07:21.608 --> 07:23.476
‐ I like to game now and then.

07:23.510 --> 07:26.446
Well, a new demon...
actually a very old one,

07:26.479 --> 07:28.248
has arrived in Purgatory.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.417
He's had many names
over many Hallow's Eves,

07:30.450 --> 07:31.451
the only time he's active.

07:31.484 --> 07:34.354
But we just call him
Rotten Jack.

07:34.387 --> 07:35.956
‐ I have heard the rumours.

07:35.989 --> 07:37.090
‐ Good.

07:37.123 --> 07:40.493
So, all of these images
represent possible targets.

07:40.527 --> 07:44.664
'Cause he gets more bloodthirsty
every Hallow's Eve.

07:44.698 --> 07:46.666
So we just try to stay clear.

07:46.700 --> 07:49.869
‐ But you bet on his...
activities?

07:49.903 --> 07:50.971
‐ Oh yeah, yeah.

07:51.004 --> 07:52.639
This Hallow's Eve, we're online.

07:52.672 --> 07:54.641
Yeah, we're taking bets
from demons

07:54.674 --> 07:57.344
all around the world.
‐ Does he know that?

07:59.312 --> 08:00.680
‐ So, you care to venture

08:00.714 --> 08:04.751
which one of these
will be his last victim?

08:07.153 --> 08:09.489
‐ The sorcerer, the warrior,

08:09.522 --> 08:12.325
the healer, the mother...

08:12.359 --> 08:14.294
The angel.
‐ Rare breed.

08:14.327 --> 08:17.564
And I too have recently
heard some rumours.

08:18.331 --> 08:20.300
‐ I should get back to my party.

08:20.333 --> 08:23.003
‐ Your party? In my bar?

08:23.036 --> 08:25.905
Holliday, you haven't
brought me booze in weeks.

08:25.939 --> 08:29.709
Yet you sit there,
drinking my wares.

08:29.743 --> 08:32.278
‐ As a once proprietor myself,

08:32.312 --> 08:33.680
may I offer this:

08:33.713 --> 08:36.883
employees will work
harder for honey.

08:37.350 --> 08:38.752
‐ Well, speaking of honey,

08:38.785 --> 08:43.790
can you give this
to your "friend" Wynonna?

08:44.391 --> 08:47.927
It's funny. I thought
she would taste sweeter.

08:49.929 --> 08:52.098
(snickering)

08:54.334 --> 08:55.568
‐ Oh, you poor fool.

08:55.602 --> 08:59.305
The only thing Wynonna detests
more than demons is her exes.

08:59.339 --> 09:00.874
‐ Oh, I think
I've bought immunity

09:00.907 --> 09:02.509
since I helped her
find her gun.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.878
‐ Which she will happily
turn on you.

09:04.911 --> 09:06.346
Front or back.

09:06.379 --> 09:09.549
‐ She was happy
when I turned her,

09:09.582 --> 09:12.619
front and back.

09:14.587 --> 09:16.489
We're not done here.

09:17.424 --> 09:19.259
‐ We most certainly are.

09:19.292 --> 09:20.994
‐ You work for me.

09:21.027 --> 09:22.262
‐ Not anymore.

09:22.295 --> 09:25.098
‐ Don't be an idiot, Holliday.

09:25.131 --> 09:27.634
I'll take what is mine,
one way or another.

09:27.667 --> 09:30.136
(wheel clicking, dinging)

09:30.170 --> 09:31.571
‐ The prey is marked!

09:31.604 --> 09:33.239
He's close to another kill!

09:33.273 --> 09:35.608
‐ Shh! That's my line.

09:39.946 --> 09:44.617
And Rotten Jack's
next potential victim is...

09:45.852 --> 09:47.454
...the mother!

09:48.254 --> 09:50.190
(knocking)

09:51.858 --> 09:53.326
‐ Ah!

09:53.359 --> 09:55.395
Now, aren't you a tall one?

09:55.428 --> 09:58.231
That is an excellent costume.

09:58.264 --> 10:00.567
I was hoping the rumours
of Halloween being cancelled

10:00.600 --> 10:01.701
this year were false.

10:01.734 --> 10:04.804
It's such a wonderful way
to get to know the neighbours!

10:07.974 --> 10:11.244
But... I have brownies
in the oven.

10:18.785 --> 10:20.687
Is this where you left
your pants?

10:20.720 --> 10:22.522
(Wynonna scoffs)
‐ As if I'm telling you.

10:22.555 --> 10:25.125
I thought you'd be happy
to celebrate Halloween together.

10:25.158 --> 10:26.259
‐ Yeah, oh yeah.
‐ Finally.

10:26.292 --> 10:29.629
‐ Love thinking about how hard
our childhood sucked.

10:31.164 --> 10:32.765
‐ Look, I know
I'm getting married,

10:32.799 --> 10:34.667
but things aren't
gonna change, Wynonna.

10:34.701 --> 10:37.637
‐ Can we just do
the mission? Okay?

10:37.670 --> 10:39.539
‐ Jer seemed more tightly
wound than usual.

10:39.572 --> 10:41.508
‐ He won't even say
what happened with Robin.

10:41.541 --> 10:43.376
‐ Yeah, well there's a lot
of not saying

10:43.409 --> 10:44.677
going around today.

10:44.711 --> 10:46.446
‐ Can you just let me be petty

10:46.479 --> 10:48.648
on this shittiest
of fake holidays?

10:49.249 --> 10:51.618
You're in love,
and your life is so perfect,

10:51.651 --> 10:54.320
just stop being
so goddamn angelic.

10:54.354 --> 10:56.456
‐ Ouch.

10:56.489 --> 10:59.092
I guess things are changing.

10:59.125 --> 11:00.660
Mostly you.

11:00.693 --> 11:02.996
(man): No trick or treaters!
‐ Ow!

11:03.029 --> 11:04.731
‐ Hey! Oi!

11:04.764 --> 11:07.367
It's Britney, bitch.
I'm here for the extractor.

11:07.934 --> 11:12.372
‐ Hey! Chili cook‐off,
back from the cruise!

11:12.972 --> 11:14.440
(both): Casey?

11:17.410 --> 11:20.813
‐ What are you doing here,
Agent Chetri?

11:20.847 --> 11:23.483
I promised management
we'd have our best minds

11:23.516 --> 11:25.552
working on neutralizing
Rotten Jack.

11:25.585 --> 11:27.420
‐ Yeah, but it's Tuesday,
Albert.

11:27.453 --> 11:29.189
My... My group meets
on Tuesdays.

11:29.222 --> 11:30.456
‐ You can't put it off?

11:30.490 --> 11:32.158
‐ Days of the week tend to be

11:32.192 --> 11:33.459
pretty set in stone.

11:33.493 --> 11:35.094
But, uh, Agent Earp
will handle it.

11:35.128 --> 11:36.930
‐ Code Orange, Jeremy.

11:36.963 --> 11:40.867
We're a hair's breadth away
from lockdown.

11:40.900 --> 11:42.835
‐ No.
‐ Excuse me?

11:42.869 --> 11:45.471
‐ I don't ask for much.
One hour a week, that's it.

11:46.239 --> 11:48.174
Don't take this
away from me too.

11:48.575 --> 11:50.777
‐ How is the... situation?

11:50.810 --> 11:54.113
Any possible reversals?
Control measures?

11:55.215 --> 11:57.317
‐ Yeah, I'm working on it.

11:58.151 --> 12:01.221
‐ I still see those oozing teeth
every time I close my eyes.

12:01.254 --> 12:03.223
‐ Could you pass
the veggie sticks?

12:03.256 --> 12:04.657
Didn't mean to startle you.

12:04.691 --> 12:06.826
Just all this talk of...

12:06.859 --> 12:08.294
oozing and teeth
makes me hungry.

12:08.328 --> 12:10.597
‐ S'all good! It's all good!

12:10.630 --> 12:12.699
I am just like,
over‐caffeinated.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.467
You know what,
how about you take mine?

12:14.500 --> 12:16.502
I'm trying to cut down.
‐ Thanks.

12:16.536 --> 12:19.272
‐ My wife says I can't sleep
in my body armour anymore.

12:19.305 --> 12:20.840
‐ Poor dude...
‐ Is she even my wife?

12:20.873 --> 12:22.909
‐ He tells the same story
every meeting.

12:22.942 --> 12:24.143
‐ Yeah.

12:24.177 --> 12:27.146
Probably the only place he can
be honest about his trauma.

12:27.180 --> 12:28.715
‐ Yeah.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.150
How have you been holding up?

12:31.184 --> 12:33.753
‐ Yeah, you know, it's nice
to be back in town.

12:33.786 --> 12:35.822
They're opening up
a new cat café.

12:35.855 --> 12:37.023
‐ That's right!

12:37.056 --> 12:40.560
BBD let you move your base
of operations back to Purgatory?

12:40.593 --> 12:42.328
‐ Yes! You remembered.

12:42.362 --> 12:44.330
Yeah! And you?

12:44.364 --> 12:46.466
‐ They have me working
in accounting.

12:46.499 --> 12:48.468
‐ I know. I remember.

12:49.235 --> 12:50.603
You okay?

12:50.637 --> 12:53.539
‐ What? Yeah, it's just...

12:53.573 --> 12:55.708
My dad loved cats.

12:56.743 --> 12:59.245
I still can't believe
I missed his funeral.

12:59.779 --> 13:03.950
‐ I am sorry about
a lot of things, Robin.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.619
‐ Sure wasn't your fault.

13:06.653 --> 13:09.722
And Black Badge is on the case.

13:09.756 --> 13:12.625
They helped me once.
They'll help me again.

13:12.659 --> 13:15.995
‐ Yeah. Yeah, we will.

13:19.399 --> 13:20.533
‐ So, uh, we're looking

13:20.566 --> 13:22.335
for something called
an extractor.

13:22.368 --> 13:25.038
You heard of it?
‐ You weren't followed, right?

13:26.172 --> 13:27.707
‐ Not as far as we know.

13:27.740 --> 13:29.642
‐ Shit. Thing is...

13:29.676 --> 13:31.944
if they're good, you don't know.

13:32.779 --> 13:35.014
‐ You afraid of anyone
in particular?

13:35.048 --> 13:36.949
FBI? NCIS? Big foot?

13:36.983 --> 13:39.385
‐ Ha! Big foot wouldn't
come out this time of year.

13:39.419 --> 13:40.953
NCIS sounds bad, though.

13:40.987 --> 13:44.424
I mean, not Black Badge bad,
but...

13:44.457 --> 13:46.426
(birds chirping)

13:46.459 --> 13:48.661
‐ Listen, we don't want to cause
you any trouble,

13:48.695 --> 13:50.730
we'll pay you for the extractor,
whatever it is.

13:50.763 --> 13:54.067
‐ It's not an "it".
It's a me.

13:54.767 --> 13:57.170
‐ Yeah, well, then...

13:57.203 --> 14:01.107
you're what, or who, we need.

14:01.140 --> 14:03.376
There's a monster on the loose.
(beeping)

14:03.409 --> 14:05.311
‐ Already? Okay, we gotta move.

14:05.345 --> 14:08.314
Look. Alright, not to scare you,
but boo, we're BBD,

14:08.348 --> 14:09.882
and we need you
to take out Rotten Jack.

14:09.916 --> 14:11.584
‐ Wait, you're Black Badge?

14:11.617 --> 14:14.120
How could you?
We cooked chili together!

14:14.153 --> 14:16.756
‐ I'm afraid the call's coming
from inside the house.

14:16.789 --> 14:18.358
‐ Yeah, but we're outside, man!

14:18.925 --> 14:21.227
(high‐pitched ringing,
screaming)

14:22.395 --> 14:23.363
‐ Geez!

14:23.396 --> 14:25.431
What is that?!

14:25.465 --> 14:27.900
We cooked chili together!

14:28.368 --> 14:30.069
Ugh!

14:32.138 --> 14:34.574
(eerie music)

14:37.744 --> 14:39.445
(Waverly): You could have had
more finesse.

14:39.479 --> 14:42.315
‐ I don't do kid gloves.
Just big angry mittens.

14:42.348 --> 14:45.184
(eerie ethereal music)

14:45.218 --> 14:47.153
(birds chirping)

14:48.488 --> 14:50.022
(voices echoing): What the hell?

14:50.056 --> 14:50.890
‐ Where did he go?

14:50.923 --> 14:53.593
I don't remember
which way we came in.

14:55.995 --> 14:59.065
(echoing): Hold my hand,
baby girl.

15:00.099 --> 15:02.435
‐ Wait. Which way
is the trailer?

15:02.468 --> 15:04.070
‐ What trailer?

15:04.103 --> 15:05.471
(echoing): Hello?!

15:05.505 --> 15:07.473
What is this place?

15:07.507 --> 15:09.342
‐ I have no idea.

15:10.143 --> 15:12.278
‐ And who are you?

15:12.311 --> 15:14.747
‐ I have no idea!

15:20.153 --> 15:22.188
‐ No shit, ladybug.

15:22.221 --> 15:23.823
‐ Are you late for school?

15:26.092 --> 15:27.427
‐ Whore school?

15:27.460 --> 15:28.761
‐ Okay, let's stay calm.

15:28.795 --> 15:30.496
What was the last thing
we remember?

15:30.530 --> 15:32.432
(sniffing)
‐ Running.

15:32.465 --> 15:34.033
(distant music)
‐ I know that song.

15:34.066 --> 15:35.168
‐ Me too.

15:35.201 --> 15:37.370
Whoever I am, I hate it.

15:41.073 --> 15:43.376
(upbeat music playing)

15:43.409 --> 15:45.378
♪ They're gone. They're gone ♪

15:45.411 --> 15:47.780
♪ The big, bad monster's gone ♪

15:47.814 --> 15:50.750
♪ Yeah, the big, bad
monster's gone ♪

15:50.783 --> 15:52.251
Ahh!

15:53.619 --> 15:54.454
‐ Oh!

15:54.487 --> 15:57.156
You're supposed to be
the nice one!

15:57.190 --> 15:59.525
‐ It was a reflex!
‐ Who are you?!

15:59.559 --> 16:01.794
Do we know you?
Do you know us?

16:01.828 --> 16:03.029
‐ I thought I knew you.

16:03.062 --> 16:04.363
‐ What are we doing here?

16:04.397 --> 16:06.232
‐ Just Hallow‐hangin'.

16:07.066 --> 16:09.035
‐ Our outfits are pretty choice.

16:09.068 --> 16:10.703
Why didn't I shave my legs?

16:11.237 --> 16:13.072
‐ Okay, we were lost.

16:13.105 --> 16:15.708
There was fog,
and then suddenly, poof!

16:15.741 --> 16:17.376
No fog.
‐ Fog?

16:17.410 --> 16:19.312
You guys are spiralling.

16:19.345 --> 16:20.646
‐ What?
‐ Wilin'.

16:20.680 --> 16:21.514
‐ Huh?
‐ High.

16:21.547 --> 16:25.051
‐ Hello!
‐ You're both very, very high.

16:25.084 --> 16:26.252
See, here's what happened.

16:26.285 --> 16:27.820
I sold you some weed...

16:27.854 --> 16:30.356
‐ Okay.
‐ Then you smoked the weed...

16:30.389 --> 16:32.525
‐ Okay, so far
this is all checking out.

16:32.558 --> 16:34.694
‐ Hybrid.
Really lets you disconnect.

16:34.727 --> 16:36.696
Forget about all your troubles.

16:36.729 --> 16:38.397
‐ Even your name?

16:38.431 --> 16:41.601
‐ Man, you really hauled
on that thing.

16:41.634 --> 16:42.702
‐ Nice.

16:43.302 --> 16:46.506
‐ 'Kay. Go home, find snacks.

16:47.106 --> 16:49.108
Do not watch the movie Cats.

16:49.141 --> 16:50.643
They say it's hilarious,

16:50.676 --> 16:52.745
but you'll never look
at Dame Judi Dench

16:52.778 --> 16:54.347
the same ever again.

16:54.380 --> 16:58.718
‐ Okay, okay. How...
how do we know where home is?

16:59.151 --> 17:00.887
‐ Oh, uh...

17:01.754 --> 17:03.589
‐ Wait. What's this?

17:04.257 --> 17:05.525
‐ Oh!

17:05.558 --> 17:07.693
Yeah, okay.
‐ That's convenient.

17:08.194 --> 17:10.530
‐ Okay, well, um, I live here.

17:10.563 --> 17:13.466
And I'm pretty sure you two
live here, so...

17:14.066 --> 17:15.868
‐ You know how to drive?

17:15.902 --> 17:17.803
‐ Let's find out.

17:18.771 --> 17:20.640
(birds chirping)

17:20.673 --> 17:22.408
(eerie music)

17:22.441 --> 17:23.843
‐ Which way's the car?

17:23.876 --> 17:25.912
‐ I don't know!
Let's go this way and see!

17:33.686 --> 17:35.788
(door closing)
(Wynonna): Hello?

17:38.491 --> 17:40.493
This is definitely our house.

17:40.993 --> 17:42.395
Are we roommates?

17:42.428 --> 17:43.930
‐ Sisters.

17:43.963 --> 17:45.965
‐ And we live together?

17:45.998 --> 17:47.833
Aww, so cute!

17:49.135 --> 17:51.470
‐ Guess neither of us
likes laundry.

17:51.504 --> 17:53.673
‐ Well, probably,
we're too busy

17:53.706 --> 17:55.641
getting ready
for this epic Halloween!

17:55.675 --> 17:58.344
‐ I fucking hate Halloween.
‐ What?

17:58.377 --> 18:00.513
It's so fun!

18:01.881 --> 18:04.684
Uh‐oh. Okay.

18:04.717 --> 18:06.152
Okay!

18:06.185 --> 18:09.422
Uh, I have a Wynonna Earp.

18:09.455 --> 18:11.123
Okay, alright,

18:11.157 --> 18:14.627
and I have a Waverly Earp!

18:15.194 --> 18:16.662
‐ A little loose, but...

18:16.696 --> 18:19.532
these buttons
are definitely familiar.

18:21.801 --> 18:24.437
Waverly!

18:24.870 --> 18:29.041
‐ You're a cop, Wynonna!

18:29.075 --> 18:30.509
‐ Mmm!
‐ Now it makes sense

18:30.543 --> 18:32.111
why you punched that guy!

18:32.144 --> 18:33.779
And you're bossy!
(Waverly gasps)

18:33.813 --> 18:35.781
‐ My training just
kicked right in.

18:35.815 --> 18:37.416
‐ Like a pro!

18:37.450 --> 18:39.418
‐ To be honest,

18:39.452 --> 18:42.321
hitting that guy felt good.

18:42.355 --> 18:45.191
Like, there was this rush...

18:45.224 --> 18:46.926
What does that say about me?

18:46.959 --> 18:50.062
‐ That your teeny tiny body
was pumped full of adrenaline!

18:51.831 --> 18:53.699
(sniffing)

18:53.733 --> 18:55.668
Whisky.

18:55.701 --> 18:57.069
(sucking)

18:58.237 --> 18:59.872
I like whisky!

19:00.740 --> 19:03.943
(gasps)
‐ Maybe it's a bar.

19:04.477 --> 19:07.813
Maybe you work there!

19:07.847 --> 19:14.387
‐ Maybe there's
a Halloween party!

19:21.494 --> 19:22.728
(door closing)

19:22.762 --> 19:24.830
‐ Talk about a ghost town.

19:24.864 --> 19:27.099
‐ Well, probably 'cause there's
no hot wench here

19:27.133 --> 19:28.834
to serve the booze.

19:29.735 --> 19:31.070
Geez...

19:31.103 --> 19:33.272
No wonder I'm so poor.

19:33.305 --> 19:34.974
‐ What?

19:35.808 --> 19:37.076
It's a shame.

19:37.109 --> 19:39.145
That shirt was made for tips.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.447
‐ Thank ya!

19:42.048 --> 19:43.015
(gasps)

19:43.049 --> 19:44.684
‐ Wynonna?
‐ What?

19:44.717 --> 19:47.720
‐ Well, Happy Halloween,
Premium Rhapsody.

19:47.753 --> 19:50.022
‐ Nedley tell you to come help?

19:50.056 --> 19:52.324
‐ Shh... yes.

19:52.358 --> 19:55.161
She said...

19:55.194 --> 19:56.595
you were short‐staffed.

19:56.629 --> 19:59.432
Hey, just remind me,
what's our drug‐testing policy?

19:59.465 --> 20:00.733
‐ I have business to attend to,

20:00.766 --> 20:02.234
I would prefer
to do it alone.

20:02.268 --> 20:03.903
I'm in no mood for your games.

20:05.271 --> 20:08.607
‐ Are you her boyfriend?
‐ We've def smashed, right?

20:08.641 --> 20:10.476
‐ Oh, you are as mature
as ever.

20:10.509 --> 20:12.244
You also in
on whatever this is?

20:12.278 --> 20:15.214
‐ Look. Don't step on my nuts,
man, I'm off duty.

20:15.247 --> 20:17.216
(door thudding open)

20:17.249 --> 20:19.552
(Waverly gasps)
Those are...

20:19.585 --> 20:22.321
‐ ...the best Halloween costumes
I've ever seen!

20:22.354 --> 20:23.756
‐ Holliday.

20:23.789 --> 20:25.958
Amon sent us to fetch the booze.

20:25.991 --> 20:29.795
If you resist, your vampire ass
can kiss these stakes.

20:34.200 --> 20:35.768
(growling)

20:35.801 --> 20:38.871
(screaming)
‐ Wynonna, use your gun, dammit!

20:38.904 --> 20:39.839
‐ What gun?!

20:39.872 --> 20:42.074
‐ Not you, her!
The demon‐killing one!

20:42.808 --> 20:44.543
(growling, screaming)

20:44.577 --> 20:48.013
‐ Ah!
‐ Dude, I will write you up!

20:50.015 --> 20:51.984
(growling, roaring)

20:52.017 --> 20:55.020
‐ Geez, Louise!
What is going on with you two?

20:55.054 --> 20:56.956
(gasps)
He's a...

20:56.989 --> 20:59.325
(both): Vampire!
(Wynonna and Waverly screaming)

20:59.358 --> 21:00.993
‐ Wynonna! Waverly!

21:01.026 --> 21:04.263
Do not go out there!
It is not safe!

21:04.296 --> 21:07.199
(suspenseful music)

21:07.233 --> 21:08.834
Wynonna?

21:13.005 --> 21:14.874
Wynonna!

21:20.212 --> 21:23.149
‐ His voice... it's so familiar.

21:24.216 --> 21:26.552
‐ Are his fangs familiar too?

21:27.386 --> 21:30.956
‐ It's gotta be a hallucination.
We're high, remember?

21:30.990 --> 21:32.858
(beeping)

21:33.793 --> 21:35.528
What's that for?
‐ All that came up

21:35.561 --> 21:37.263
was a tiny skull emoji.

21:38.164 --> 21:39.398
‐ Good skull? Bad skull?

21:39.431 --> 21:41.867
‐ It's always a bad skull!

21:42.668 --> 21:45.938
(intense music)

21:45.971 --> 21:48.274
(grating)

21:56.649 --> 21:57.716
(demon mumbling)

21:57.750 --> 22:01.854
I asked you for the whole lot,
and Holliday's head!

22:01.887 --> 22:03.656
Well, batter up, buttercup.

22:03.689 --> 22:05.858
(muffled exclamation)

22:06.826 --> 22:08.861
‐ Come again?
(muffled answer)

22:08.894 --> 22:09.962
(choking)

22:09.995 --> 22:12.398
(clearing throat)

22:12.431 --> 22:14.333
(gasping)

22:14.366 --> 22:15.634
(coughing)

22:15.668 --> 22:17.102
One more time.

22:17.136 --> 22:18.838
‐ The Earp girls were there,

22:18.871 --> 22:21.173
but they weren't themselves.
‐ Meaning?

22:21.207 --> 22:22.675
‐ Wynonna didn't even
have her gun!

22:22.708 --> 22:25.878
‐ She already lost
Peacemaker again?

22:25.911 --> 22:28.113
God Dallas!

22:29.048 --> 22:32.151
They were acting like
their brains were scrambled.

22:32.184 --> 22:34.019
Not just scrambled, erased!

22:34.053 --> 22:36.355
‐ They must have tried
to cross the border.

22:36.388 --> 22:38.591
‐ Yeah...
(laughing)

22:39.525 --> 22:41.927
(hollering)

22:41.961 --> 22:44.230
‐ Well, Happy Halloween to me!

22:45.164 --> 22:47.299
Hey, Kippy? Gas up the limo!

22:47.333 --> 22:49.668
‐ You mean the Corolla?
‐ Just do it!

22:49.702 --> 22:51.136
(laughing)

22:51.170 --> 22:53.172
‐ So what's it like for you?
‐ Hm?

22:53.205 --> 22:54.907
‐ Do you get the headaches too?

22:54.940 --> 22:57.509
‐ Uh, you know,
it's more like a heartache.

22:58.077 --> 23:01.413
‐ Huh?
‐ B. T. dubs, I love that tie.

23:01.447 --> 23:02.681
‐ Oh, yeah.

23:02.715 --> 23:06.018
Don't know why I thought a town
that literally fights demons

23:06.051 --> 23:07.620
would do Halloween.

23:09.154 --> 23:11.590
And I already
wear a mask every day.

23:21.033 --> 23:22.001
(phone chiming)

23:22.034 --> 23:24.603
‐ Uh, I'm sorry, one second.

23:25.771 --> 23:27.406
Not great timing, bro.

23:27.439 --> 23:30.342
‐ The Earp sisters have lost
their Earp‐lovin' minds!

23:30.376 --> 23:31.744
‐ Okay, what would that
even look like?

23:31.777 --> 23:33.212
Staying inside
for knitting and tea?

23:33.245 --> 23:35.214
‐ They do not seem
to know their own names.

23:35.247 --> 23:38.417
They do not seem to know
that vampires and demons exist,

23:38.450 --> 23:40.085
let alone that they
are the forces

23:40.119 --> 23:42.254
meant to deal with said demons!

23:42.288 --> 23:43.289
‐ Oh, shit.

23:43.322 --> 23:45.157
No, they haven't
lost their minds,

23:45.190 --> 23:46.725
they've lost their memories.

23:46.759 --> 23:48.060
‐ A spell?

23:48.093 --> 23:50.329
A curse?
‐ No, it's too much to explain.

23:50.362 --> 23:53.065
Doc, this is important:
Was anybody else with them?

23:53.098 --> 23:54.133
‐ They were alone.

23:54.166 --> 23:56.335
‐ I'm gonna need you to run
an emergency errand.

23:56.368 --> 23:58.704
And listen, we're gonna need
to come up with a signal.

23:59.672 --> 24:00.973
Okay.

24:02.308 --> 24:04.643
Hey, I am so sorry, I gotta go.

24:04.677 --> 24:05.945
‐ Someone special?

24:05.978 --> 24:08.113
‐ Ah, just an enigma,
wrapped in a mystery,

24:08.147 --> 24:09.515
wrapped in a moustache.

24:09.548 --> 24:12.051
‐ Hoo, boy. I been there.

24:12.518 --> 24:14.486
‐ What?
(beeping)

24:14.520 --> 24:16.188
Shit! Skull emoji.

24:16.221 --> 24:18.490
I... I gotta go.
We'll catch up, okay?

24:18.524 --> 24:20.526
(voice over speaker):
Code Orange! Code Orange!

24:20.559 --> 24:22.328
‐ Code Orange?
‐ We are officially in lockdown.

24:22.361 --> 24:24.129
Jeremy, please tell me
your agent has eyes

24:24.163 --> 24:25.130
on the monster.

24:25.164 --> 24:27.232
‐ I'll go check. I'll go check.

24:27.633 --> 24:28.634
Oh, man.

24:28.667 --> 24:32.271
Are you freaking out?
'Cause I am freaking out.

24:32.304 --> 24:33.939
‐ Shh!
(both giggling)

24:34.373 --> 24:36.075
‐ I'll get you. I'll get you.

24:36.108 --> 24:37.276
Don't fall.
‐ You got me?

24:37.309 --> 24:38.644
You spot me? You spot me?

24:38.677 --> 24:39.712
‐ Yeah!

24:42.848 --> 24:44.383
‐ Darling!

24:44.817 --> 24:47.019
I came as soon as I heard.

24:47.052 --> 24:49.521
‐ Okay. Which one of us
is "darling"?

24:49.555 --> 24:50.823
‐ What was it this time?

24:50.856 --> 24:52.358
Tequila and Trammies?

24:52.391 --> 24:54.560
Cocaine and Chardonnay?

24:55.094 --> 24:57.296
You Earp Sisters
do love to party.

24:57.863 --> 24:59.498
‐ I just want to go
trick‐or‐treating.

24:59.531 --> 25:01.400
‐ Well, it's not safe
for you out here.

25:01.433 --> 25:03.402
For any of us.
Which is why...

25:03.435 --> 25:06.638
I'm hosting a Halloween bash
at my place.

25:06.672 --> 25:08.207
‐ Yay!
‐ Okay...

25:08.240 --> 25:11.110
One sec, "darling".
‐ Yeah.

25:11.143 --> 25:12.678
Wait.

25:12.711 --> 25:13.979
‐ Geez.

25:14.013 --> 25:16.682
‐ What's wrong?
‐ Huh?

25:16.715 --> 25:19.051
He seems kinda sleazy
and I kinda want to punch him,

25:19.084 --> 25:21.053
but that also
feels like my type.

25:21.086 --> 25:23.522
‐ Oh geez, I hope not.

25:23.555 --> 25:26.592
Blegh.
My sister deserves better.

25:26.625 --> 25:27.393
‐ Aw!

25:27.426 --> 25:29.828
‐ I was trying
to be a gentleman.

25:29.862 --> 25:31.530
‐ Blegh...

25:31.563 --> 25:35.300
‐ If you need proof
that I know you...

25:37.403 --> 25:40.305
‐ Okay! That could be anyone's.

25:40.339 --> 25:42.508
‐ There's a rhinestone
donut on the back.

25:42.541 --> 25:44.176
‐ Yas! Gimme!

25:44.209 --> 25:45.544
‐ Shall we?

25:52.551 --> 25:54.720
(Wynonna): We're gonna
get candy!

25:54.753 --> 25:56.055
(laughing)

25:56.088 --> 25:57.623
(Waverly): We forgot.
‐ Woo‐hoo!

25:57.656 --> 25:59.158
(Amon): Let's go!

25:59.191 --> 26:01.860
(Wynonna): Trick or treat,
motherfucker!

26:05.097 --> 26:06.899
(sniffing)

26:10.936 --> 26:13.405
‐ I‐I can override the security
system with your phone.

26:13.439 --> 26:15.074
And just a quick
control‐alt‐delete,

26:15.107 --> 26:16.442
and I'll be back
in Purgatory before‐‐

26:16.475 --> 26:19.745
‐ Absolutely not.
We stay here, follow procedure.

26:19.778 --> 26:21.580
(alarm blaring)

26:22.247 --> 26:23.782
‐ Okay, then.

26:24.950 --> 26:27.219
‐ Robin, last year was a mess.

26:27.252 --> 26:29.855
Remember how we ran
out of body bags?

26:29.888 --> 26:32.157
‐ I'm in accounting so... no.

26:32.191 --> 26:34.493
‐ Last year
we didn't have Wynonna.

26:34.526 --> 26:36.728
‐ Can Wynonna stop
upper management?

26:36.762 --> 26:39.064
The fog? My panic attack?

26:39.098 --> 26:40.365
‐ What fog?

26:40.399 --> 26:42.434
‐ Agent St. Cloud! Here.

26:45.637 --> 26:46.939
Better?

26:46.972 --> 26:49.308
‐ I didn't mean to seem crass...

26:49.341 --> 26:52.377
about your friends out there
on the front lines.

26:52.411 --> 26:53.946
‐ I'm, I'm sorry too.

26:53.979 --> 26:56.148
(alarm blaring continues)

26:56.181 --> 26:57.449
(eerie music)

26:57.483 --> 26:59.084
‐ For what?

26:59.118 --> 27:01.153
(gasping)

27:02.654 --> 27:04.656
You... you put...

27:04.690 --> 27:06.658
almond milk in here?

27:06.692 --> 27:08.494
‐ Mm‐hmm.
(gasping)

27:08.527 --> 27:10.496
‐ Soy?
‐ Yeah, yeah. A bit of both.

27:10.529 --> 27:13.132
‐ I can only consume pure,

27:13.165 --> 27:14.633
pure dairy!

27:14.666 --> 27:16.969
‐ Yeah, yeah.
Call it vegan revenge.

27:17.002 --> 27:18.303
‐ He doesn't sound very good.

27:18.337 --> 27:20.472
‐ Either you hand over
your phone to me now

27:20.506 --> 27:22.241
so I can bypass
the security system,

27:22.274 --> 27:24.510
or I take your meds, dump them
in some oat milk,

27:24.543 --> 27:26.345
and watch you balloon
like the Kool‐Aid Man.

27:26.378 --> 27:29.715
‐ Oh, no!
‐ Oh yeah!

27:32.918 --> 27:34.987
(coughing)
Great. Thank you!

27:35.020 --> 27:36.989
So sorry to rope
accounting into this.

27:37.022 --> 27:39.024
‐ We gotta save
your friends, right?

27:39.057 --> 27:41.727
‐ Yeah. Thanks, Robin.

27:41.760 --> 27:43.295
‐ Of course.

27:43.328 --> 27:45.764
Good luck.
‐ Yeah.

27:47.766 --> 27:49.468
‐ He's so sweet.

27:49.501 --> 27:50.936
(gasping)

27:50.969 --> 27:52.771
Oh. Okay.

27:53.672 --> 27:55.641
(choking)

27:57.509 --> 28:00.012
‐ Lucky for you,
Mercedes has extra costumes.

28:00.045 --> 28:02.281
‐ Yes! Love that bitch.

28:03.015 --> 28:04.683
I do remember Mercedes.

28:04.716 --> 28:07.219
Red hair, 'tude like if
Godzilla was a lady boss.

28:07.252 --> 28:09.021
‐ Fuck, her memory's
coming back.

28:09.054 --> 28:10.789
‐ I like red hair.
‐ Ah!

28:10.822 --> 28:12.391
‐ It reminds me of love.

28:12.958 --> 28:14.626
And handcuffs.

28:14.660 --> 28:17.796
‐ Bit weird,
but you do you, baby girl.

28:18.197 --> 28:20.332
(Wynonna): Fuck it up!
Fuck it up!

28:20.365 --> 28:22.000
(Waverly and Wynonna giggling)

28:22.034 --> 28:23.602
(sniffing)

28:23.635 --> 28:25.637
‐ Oh!

28:26.205 --> 28:28.774
It's time for you to rise up!

28:30.943 --> 28:32.511
Okay...

28:32.945 --> 28:34.313
The Clantons are gone.

28:34.346 --> 28:36.215
Holliday is on the run.

28:36.248 --> 28:38.517
The Earp sisters are blank.

28:38.550 --> 28:39.918
Now...

28:39.952 --> 28:42.254
What is the right move?

28:42.287 --> 28:43.789
What is the smart move?

28:43.822 --> 28:46.692
‐ I think your boyfriend
might be a cokehead.

28:46.725 --> 28:49.294
‐ God, why wouldn't you
save me from him?

28:49.328 --> 28:51.964
Ready? Reveal time!

28:51.997 --> 28:53.599
‐ Okay!

28:54.066 --> 28:55.634
‐ Casey.

28:55.667 --> 28:57.703
(birds chirping)

28:57.736 --> 28:59.538
Casey?

29:06.278 --> 29:08.080
‐ I'm so glad you're here.

29:08.113 --> 29:09.748
‐ Are you, now?

29:09.781 --> 29:11.316
‐ I've been working
on something.

29:11.350 --> 29:12.985
Let me know what you think.

29:14.119 --> 29:16.722
(struggling grunts)

29:18.323 --> 29:19.691
'Kay...

29:19.725 --> 29:22.861
"Dear Wyn and Waves,
I'm sorry about what I did,

29:22.894 --> 29:25.097
but my body went
into fog or flight mode.

29:25.130 --> 29:26.431
I really hope you made it home

29:26.465 --> 29:28.233
before Rotten Jack
murdered you.

29:28.267 --> 29:30.068
Your pal, Casey.

29:30.102 --> 29:32.571
P. S. Dance like
no one's watching."

29:34.439 --> 29:36.575
‐ I am here on behalf
of Agent Chetri

29:36.608 --> 29:38.844
who requires
your extraction services.

29:40.078 --> 29:42.281
‐ Dude, I'm not a hero.

29:42.314 --> 29:44.116
I'm a fuck‐up.

29:44.149 --> 29:45.817
‐ You can be both.

29:47.286 --> 29:49.021
Do you know what the opposite
of fear is?

29:49.821 --> 29:50.989
‐ Raef?

29:51.023 --> 29:53.158
‐ It's love.
‐ Oh.

29:53.191 --> 29:56.328
‐ I have literally been
to hell and back.

29:56.361 --> 29:57.663
I lost my best friend.

29:57.696 --> 29:59.865
I've never even known
my own daughter.

29:59.898 --> 30:03.101
All that loss and the fear
of losing so much more

30:03.135 --> 30:05.337
has been a yolk on my neck.

30:06.171 --> 30:08.140
But love...

30:08.173 --> 30:10.709
It's always lightened the load.

30:12.477 --> 30:16.014
And I'm not ready to lose
my greatest love of all.

30:16.848 --> 30:18.850
W...

30:18.884 --> 30:20.519
The Earp sisters.

30:20.552 --> 30:23.355
Both of them, of course.

30:23.789 --> 30:24.656
‐ Damn.

30:24.690 --> 30:27.025
That's way better
than the shit I wrote.

30:29.895 --> 30:31.963
‐ Come with me.

30:31.997 --> 30:33.932
Let me protect you.

30:33.965 --> 30:36.468
And help me protect them.

30:37.536 --> 30:39.171
‐ Let's go kick
some pumpkin ass!

30:39.971 --> 30:42.941
Also, the woman
you're totally not in love with

30:42.974 --> 30:44.810
left this behind.

30:45.510 --> 30:47.913
(intense music)

30:50.048 --> 30:51.416
‐ Yeah!

30:52.217 --> 30:56.621
‐ A cursed All Hallow's Eve,
my patrons!

30:56.655 --> 30:59.925
And to our fellow bettors
around the world,

30:59.958 --> 31:03.128
it's a shame you can't be here,
because this crowd...

31:03.161 --> 31:05.530
Wow! Wish you could see it.

31:05.564 --> 31:08.467
Now, I have decided...

31:08.500 --> 31:13.538
to give you
the show of a lifetime!

31:16.007 --> 31:19.177
‐ Are we... are we
the guests of honour?

31:20.112 --> 31:23.548
‐ Aw, no, my dear Waverly Earp.

31:23.582 --> 31:25.117
You are the main attraction.

31:25.150 --> 31:29.688
Because what could be more
exciting than an auction?

31:29.721 --> 31:32.090
‐ Yeah!
‐ Literally anything?

31:32.124 --> 31:34.259
‐ Wait, I'm Waverly?

31:34.292 --> 31:36.928
‐ My dear Wynonna Earp.

31:36.962 --> 31:39.231
You are the greatest
demon‐hunter

31:39.264 --> 31:41.199
that has ever lived.
Until tonight,

31:41.233 --> 31:45.203
when you and your baby sister

31:45.237 --> 31:47.439
will be torn limb from limb

31:47.472 --> 31:50.942
by the highest bidder!

31:50.976 --> 31:52.277
‐ Yeah!

31:52.778 --> 31:54.679
‐ He either needs to do
less drugs,

31:54.713 --> 31:56.581
or way, way, way more.

32:02.053 --> 32:03.321
‐ I thought you were a cop.

32:03.355 --> 32:06.625
‐ One thousand!
Do I hear one thousand?

32:06.658 --> 32:07.959
‐ A thousand?

32:07.993 --> 32:11.430
For the greatest
demon‐hunter of all time?

32:11.463 --> 32:12.998
‐ Five thousand dollars!

32:13.031 --> 32:15.000
‐ Five thousand dollars!

32:15.033 --> 32:17.002
‐ You're cool.
‐ They're bidding to kill you!

32:17.035 --> 32:19.805
‐ I know, but low‐key? Fuck you.

32:19.838 --> 32:21.506
‐ Ten thousand dollars!

32:21.540 --> 32:23.208
‐ Nope. No, you, you can't bid.

32:23.241 --> 32:25.277
‐ She's my most important thing.
‐ Gross.

32:25.310 --> 32:28.113
Oh! Twenty thousand
from the cryptoid!

32:28.146 --> 32:30.749
‐ I have a name. It's Remy.

32:30.782 --> 32:33.418
‐ Do I hear thirty thousand?
Thirty thousand!

32:33.452 --> 32:36.154
Going once.

32:36.188 --> 32:37.088
Going twice!

32:37.122 --> 32:41.126
‐ Fifty thousand dollars
to kill the Earps!

32:42.294 --> 32:43.829
‐ Wow!

32:47.399 --> 32:49.434
‐ I may not know who I am,

32:49.468 --> 32:51.369
but I know I'm not alone.

32:52.037 --> 32:54.539
‐ You were the best sister
I ever had.

32:55.340 --> 32:56.741
‐ How do you know?

32:56.775 --> 32:58.243
‐ I know.

32:58.276 --> 33:00.178
‐ Remy.
‐ Doc!

33:00.212 --> 33:02.214
‐ The winner...

33:02.247 --> 33:04.749
with a bid
of fifty thousand dollars

33:04.783 --> 33:07.853
to execute
these twisted sisters...

33:07.886 --> 33:09.354
‐ Underrated band.

33:09.387 --> 33:12.557
‐ I will hang Amon
with his own cravat!

33:12.591 --> 33:13.825
(coughing)

33:13.859 --> 33:15.427
‐ On with the show!

33:15.460 --> 33:16.962
(coughing)

33:19.498 --> 33:20.866
A gun. Really?

33:20.899 --> 33:24.169
It's a bit pedestrian,
but... fine.

33:26.104 --> 33:27.572
‐ No, no, no, no, no.

33:27.606 --> 33:29.174
‐ Shh, it's okay.

33:29.207 --> 33:31.109
‐ It's happening!
What are you waiting for?

33:31.142 --> 33:32.110
‐ Ready!

33:32.143 --> 33:34.446
Aim!

33:34.479 --> 33:35.514
Fire!

33:35.547 --> 33:37.249
(screaming)

33:37.816 --> 33:38.783
(snickering)

33:38.817 --> 33:40.185
(panting)

33:44.022 --> 33:46.625
‐ We had a signal!

33:46.658 --> 33:48.326
‐ Yes!
‐ Jeremy!

33:48.360 --> 33:50.228
‐ Hey! Wynonna!
Do you remember who you are?

33:50.262 --> 33:52.831
‐ Who else would I be, dipshit?
‐ Okay, good! It worked!

33:52.864 --> 33:54.499
Now go kick some ass!

33:54.533 --> 33:56.835
‐ Auction this, asshole!

33:58.403 --> 33:59.437
You know what I mean.

33:59.471 --> 34:00.739
‐ Murder her.

34:00.772 --> 34:02.073
(growling)

34:02.774 --> 34:04.109
‐ Ah! Ugh!

34:04.843 --> 34:06.611
(ticking)

34:06.645 --> 34:07.812
‐ You going somewhere?

34:07.846 --> 34:10.148
(dinging)
‐ Holy shit!

34:10.181 --> 34:12.617
Rotten Jack's
going after an angel!

34:12.651 --> 34:13.852
(laughing)

34:13.885 --> 34:16.855
‐ Finally, after
all these years!

34:16.888 --> 34:18.356
I'm rich!

34:18.390 --> 34:19.858
(thudding)

34:20.458 --> 34:21.626
(giggling)

34:25.297 --> 34:27.432
‐ Kippy? No!

34:27.465 --> 34:28.900
‐ Rotten Jack's here.

34:28.934 --> 34:30.569
Which means the angel
must be too.

34:31.670 --> 34:32.871
(growling)

34:32.904 --> 34:35.006
(objects clattering)

34:35.540 --> 34:37.842
Uh, just a little betting game.

34:37.876 --> 34:39.244
Nothing personal, Jackie.

34:39.277 --> 34:41.246
They're yours. All of them.

34:41.279 --> 34:43.014
Y‐You take them.

34:43.048 --> 34:44.983
Just let me go.

34:46.217 --> 34:47.018
‐ No.

34:47.052 --> 34:48.520
(door creaking)

34:49.688 --> 34:51.389
(lock clunking)

34:51.423 --> 34:53.525
‐ Amon's locked us in!

34:53.558 --> 34:56.695
‐ Now, damn it.
You're the extractor!

34:56.728 --> 34:58.263
Wynonna!

34:59.965 --> 35:02.100
‐ Wait, Wynonna!
We need him alive!

35:03.268 --> 35:04.302
(giggling)

35:04.336 --> 35:05.904
‐ Hey!

35:05.937 --> 35:07.839
(intense music)

35:07.872 --> 35:09.541
(growling)

35:10.342 --> 35:12.143
‐ It's time
for smashing pumpkins!

35:12.711 --> 35:14.212
‐ Ah!

35:26.091 --> 35:29.294
‐ No! You'll burn! It's my job.

35:32.464 --> 35:34.666
(suspenseful music)

35:54.452 --> 35:57.589
(loud bong)

35:57.622 --> 35:59.924
‐ So that's why they call you
the extractor.

35:59.958 --> 36:02.694
‐ Oh my God,
I had sex with Amon.

36:03.294 --> 36:05.463
‐ I guess Dad was right.

36:05.497 --> 36:08.266
Nothing good happens
on Halloween.

36:12.070 --> 36:13.705
‐ Innards!

36:13.738 --> 36:18.076
‐ I appreciate the gesture,
but I don't bake.

36:18.109 --> 36:20.445
‐ From your Te Deum Dead
Pumpkin Spice.

36:20.979 --> 36:22.213
You wanted demon deliveries.

36:22.247 --> 36:24.649
‐ We wanted him extracted.

36:24.683 --> 36:26.618
Agent Earp, is it?

36:26.651 --> 36:28.420
As in, his hell fire itself.

36:28.453 --> 36:30.755
‐ Yeah, well I got you
something better:

36:30.789 --> 36:32.390
less dead people.

36:32.991 --> 36:34.693
‐ We killed the dude.
Saved Halloween.

36:36.361 --> 36:37.696
‐ Do I...

36:37.729 --> 36:39.297
put this in the fridge?

36:39.330 --> 36:41.166
‐ Listen... That fog
at the edge

36:41.199 --> 36:43.201
of the Ghost River Triangle,

36:43.234 --> 36:45.203
is that a BBD
containment strategy?

36:45.236 --> 36:46.604
‐ You're hilarious.

36:46.638 --> 36:49.307
We can't even get
the popcorn machine to work.

36:50.942 --> 36:52.644
‐ Hey.

36:53.244 --> 36:56.081
C'mon, I wanna show you
something.

36:56.114 --> 36:58.783
Truth is, we've been
monitoring and studying

36:58.817 --> 37:00.185
the fog for months now.

37:00.218 --> 37:02.320
‐ Where's it coming from?
‐ Best guess? The Garden.

37:02.353 --> 37:04.089
Those darts I shot you with,

37:04.122 --> 37:06.191
a small dose of the serum
can speed up recovery

37:06.224 --> 37:07.559
if exposure is limited.

37:07.592 --> 37:10.161
But too much,
and it's lights out.

37:10.195 --> 37:11.463
Permanently.

37:12.197 --> 37:14.399
You remember Robin Jett, right?

37:18.970 --> 37:20.572
‐ I thought I did.

37:20.605 --> 37:22.173
‐ Nice to meet you?

37:22.207 --> 37:24.809
‐ This is Wynonna.

37:26.044 --> 37:27.412
Agent Earp.

37:27.445 --> 37:29.814
Robin helped me avert
the lockdown.

37:29.848 --> 37:32.016
‐ I got to EpiPen my boss.

37:32.050 --> 37:33.284
Big day.

37:33.318 --> 37:36.321
Sorry, I'm in a rush
to clock out.

37:36.354 --> 37:39.457
My boyfriend and I have a date
to watch The Babadook.

37:40.325 --> 37:41.459
Again.

37:43.762 --> 37:46.631
(soft music)

37:50.135 --> 37:53.638
‐ At the Homestead,
during the evacuation...

37:55.006 --> 37:57.242
we were taken by soldiers.

37:58.543 --> 38:00.145
They put us in the back
of their truck,

38:00.178 --> 38:02.380
headed out of
the Ghost River Triangle.

38:03.248 --> 38:06.084
They tasered me, tied me up.

38:07.252 --> 38:09.220
I was so worried about you

38:09.254 --> 38:11.089
being stuck
in the garden that...

38:11.122 --> 38:14.492
I asked Robin to find you.

38:14.526 --> 38:16.194
To help you.

38:17.128 --> 38:18.630
To jump.

38:20.632 --> 38:22.433
And he did.

38:22.467 --> 38:24.435
Right into
that mind‐altering fog

38:24.469 --> 38:26.704
that suddenly surrounded
the Triangle.

38:31.075 --> 38:33.244
He was in it for weeks.

38:34.412 --> 38:36.781
And when they finally
pulled him out...

38:38.817 --> 38:41.319
he had torn his own face off.

38:47.692 --> 38:49.794
I've been going
to these meetings every Tuesday

38:49.828 --> 38:52.797
just so I can slip small doses
of serum into his coffee,

38:52.831 --> 38:55.567
hoping it will build up
in his system over time.

38:57.368 --> 39:00.538
‐ I can't believe you've been
carrying all this on your own.

39:01.840 --> 39:04.075
‐ I just want him to be happy.

39:04.108 --> 39:05.810
(crying)

39:08.146 --> 39:10.782
Even if it's with a new face

39:10.815 --> 39:13.518
or in the arms of someone else.

39:14.085 --> 39:16.621
‐ You'll figure it out.

39:16.654 --> 39:17.488
‐ No.

39:17.522 --> 39:19.357
‐ And we'll help you
any way we can.

39:19.390 --> 39:21.125
‐ Oh, no.
That's just it, Wynonna.

39:21.159 --> 39:22.861
This mind fog...

39:22.894 --> 39:24.696
it's spreading.

39:33.004 --> 39:35.573
and I wanted
a sc

39:35.607 --> 39:37.275
(chuckling)

39:37.308 --> 39:40.211
‐ So I stole a pair
of Ward's overalls

39:40.245 --> 39:42.814
and two fistfuls of straw,
and smuggled them to school

39:42.847 --> 39:44.482
in my backpack.

39:47.085 --> 39:49.187
‐ When Daddy found out,

39:49.220 --> 39:51.956
he locked you in the cellar
for three days.

39:52.523 --> 39:54.292
‐ Yup.

39:54.325 --> 39:56.494
But you looked cute as hell,

39:56.527 --> 39:59.097
and you finally got some candy.
So fuck him.

40:02.300 --> 40:04.435
‐ I'm getting married.

40:05.737 --> 40:08.006
‐ Yeah, you are.

40:10.875 --> 40:13.244
‐ And Nicole is my person.

40:14.913 --> 40:16.547
‐ She's a good one.

40:22.921 --> 40:25.156
‐ But you're my sister.

40:28.526 --> 40:31.696
Nothing will ever
change that, Wynonna.

40:32.130 --> 40:34.032
You are...

40:34.565 --> 40:37.302
and have always been...

40:37.335 --> 40:38.836
my hero.

40:39.671 --> 40:41.906
‐ It's easy when you know
exactly who you're fighting for.

40:41.940 --> 40:45.443
‐ What have we here?

40:45.944 --> 40:49.047
Loitering on private property.

40:53.518 --> 40:55.320
‐ Oh...

40:55.353 --> 40:57.488
My...

40:57.522 --> 40:58.456
God.

40:58.489 --> 41:00.692
‐ Suddenly, I'm in the middle
of a porno.

41:01.392 --> 41:02.760
Yup.

41:04.329 --> 41:07.031
God, yup. It's gonna happen.

41:07.065 --> 41:09.267
It's gonna happen
right beside me.

41:10.101 --> 41:11.769
‐ You taste like marshmallows.

41:12.570 --> 41:14.939
Hey, you mind if I steal her
for a minute?

41:14.973 --> 41:16.741
‐ A minute?

41:17.942 --> 41:19.978
Woman, you'd better
make her happy

41:20.011 --> 41:22.513
for the rest of her damn life.

41:23.815 --> 41:25.283
‐ I will.

41:28.987 --> 41:31.122
(laughing)

41:33.958 --> 41:36.027
‐ Hey.
‐ Hmm?

41:36.060 --> 41:38.296
You could just call him,
you know?

41:40.431 --> 41:42.767
‐ Happy Halloween, baby girl.

41:52.810 --> 41:54.679
(Nicole and Waverly laughing)

41:54.712 --> 41:56.948
(struggling grunts)

41:57.281 --> 41:59.484
‐ Why the hell are we out here,
Dallas?

41:59.517 --> 42:02.720
‐ You are here because I called.

42:03.087 --> 42:06.324
We almost died at the hands
of Rotten Jack

42:06.357 --> 42:10.261
because your boss risked
your necks to fudge a bet.

42:10.294 --> 42:12.063
‐ Amon rigged the game?

42:12.096 --> 42:14.732
‐ I suppose he dressed
Waverly Earp

42:14.766 --> 42:17.268
as an angel just for kicks?

42:17.301 --> 42:20.171
‐ I mean, yeah, she's cute,

42:20.204 --> 42:21.639
but an angel?

42:21.672 --> 42:24.242
‐ He also locked us in
while he fled.

42:25.476 --> 42:27.178
‐ Dallas!

42:27.211 --> 42:30.014
You dipshit, untie me!

42:30.048 --> 42:31.849
(growling, man laughing)

42:31.883 --> 42:33.851
‐ What are we supposed
to do with him?

42:33.885 --> 42:35.420
‐ I ain't your boss.

42:35.453 --> 42:39.290
You are free to do with him
as you please.

42:43.094 --> 42:44.462
‐ Free?

42:44.495 --> 42:45.897
Shit, boys,

42:45.930 --> 42:48.232
that sounds like
a fine deal to me!

42:48.266 --> 42:49.867
(men laughing)

42:49.901 --> 42:51.669
(growling)

42:53.137 --> 42:55.506
(screaming, screeching)

42:56.140 --> 42:59.177
Subtitling: difuze
