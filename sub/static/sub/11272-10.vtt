00:12.001 --> 00:15.335
I'm looking for Sam Malone,
the ex-Red Sox player.

00:15.505 --> 00:17.663
Over there behind the bar.

00:17.840 --> 00:23.296
- Boy, has he gotten old.
- No, son, I'm Sam Malone.

00:23.471 --> 00:25.878
I know.

00:27.392 --> 00:30.392
Your mother knows
you hang around in bars?

00:30.561 --> 00:33.811
My brother, Doug,
is the biggest Red Sox fan ever.

00:33.981 --> 00:36.686
He's in hospital having his tonsils out.

00:36.859 --> 00:40.062
It would mean a lot
if he could have an autograph.

00:40.237 --> 00:42.645
- Sure thing.
- Here you go.

00:42.823 --> 00:47.781
Not yours. I figured you'd know
where to find Carl Yastrzemski.

00:47.953 --> 00:50.361
No, but I'll start you on your way.

00:50.539 --> 00:52.579
Sam, hold it.

00:52.750 --> 00:57.411
Just kidding. Here's your ball. I'm sorry.
We don't keep in touch.

00:57.587 --> 01:01.502
Doug will be disappointed.
I don't know what to do.

01:01.675 --> 01:04.343
Could you sign it? lt's almost as good.

01:04.510 --> 01:07.880
You sure your brother won't mind?

01:08.890 --> 01:13.220
Yeah. He doesn't know what
Yastrzemski's handwriting looks like.

01:15.104 --> 01:17.144
Good point.

02:30.762 --> 02:35.720
OK, cut the crap. Today's my birthday.
You all know that.

02:35.892 --> 02:39.391
If you're planning a party for me,
and you better be,

02:39.562 --> 02:41.602
Iet's get the show on the road.

02:41.773 --> 02:44.892
If that's not a cue for merriment, what is?

02:45.067 --> 02:47.737
Just a small token of my appreciation.

02:47.904 --> 02:50.311
A very small token.

02:50.489 --> 02:53.823
Good things come in small packages.

02:53.993 --> 02:59.449
Little things come in small packages.
Perfume.

03:00.540 --> 03:03.328
No, toilet water.

03:09.090 --> 03:13.254
Gag gift, I went for it. OK.

03:15.598 --> 03:17.673
All right, Carla.

03:18.767 --> 03:23.393
- Maybe this will make it up to you.
- Now, this is more like it. All right.

03:34.949 --> 03:36.989
A jelly bean.

03:39.454 --> 03:44.579
Thank you, Norm. Another gag gift.
You guys are too much.

03:44.751 --> 03:49.911
And garlic flavoured. Nice touch, Norm.

03:50.089 --> 03:52.128
All right. Come on, stop.

03:52.299 --> 03:56.344
You know how these clowns
have to get their gags in.

03:56.512 --> 04:00.177
We saved the best for last.
This is from me and from Coach.

04:04.270 --> 04:06.309
Silverware.

04:11.110 --> 04:15.189
- Lone Ranger?
- You wear it to ride on Silver.

04:20.410 --> 04:24.325
Don't you get it, Carla?
You wear it to ride on Silver.

04:24.498 --> 04:30.121
- Silverware.
- Hilarious. Thanks a bunch, guys.

04:30.295 --> 04:32.537
Don't thank us, it's the thought.

04:34.132 --> 04:36.374
Can we throw a party or what?

04:39.763 --> 04:43.760
- There he is.
- Can't we put this off till tomorrow?

04:43.934 --> 04:47.137
It's such a lovely evening.
Let's not despoil it.

04:47.312 --> 04:52.388
You only inflame violent emotional
confrontations by putting them off.

04:53.776 --> 04:56.398
Your intelligence inflames me.

04:56.571 --> 05:01.114
Really? Well, e = mc squared.

05:03.035 --> 05:05.822
Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.

05:05.996 --> 05:08.036
Baby!

05:10.168 --> 05:12.206
How about a couple of brandies?

05:12.377 --> 05:15.379
Where were you?
You missed Carla's party.

05:15.548 --> 05:19.415
We discovered this
French-Japanese restaurant.

05:19.593 --> 05:21.633
Very chic, dark, romantic.

05:21.804 --> 05:24.176
Be careful about unlighted joints.

05:24.348 --> 05:27.515
You don't know
what grubby food they'll slip you.

05:27.685 --> 05:29.677
Not Chez Fujimoto.

05:30.771 --> 05:36.062
Sam, Frasier and l
have something important to tell you.

05:36.235 --> 05:38.274
Sam, this may be rough going.

05:38.445 --> 05:42.028
Despite your vehement protests
to the contrary,

05:42.199 --> 05:44.986
and without disparaging your sincerity,

05:45.160 --> 05:48.575
we believe you're suffering
some emotional residue

05:48.746 --> 05:51.498
from your relationship with Diane.

05:51.666 --> 05:56.791
I'm sorry, Frasier, I must have dozed off
for a paragraph or two.

05:56.963 --> 05:59.003
What was he saying?

05:59.174 --> 06:02.708
We came to
an important decision tonight.

06:02.885 --> 06:07.179
Sam, brace yourself.
Diane and I are going to cohabitate.

06:07.348 --> 06:11.974
Right here in the bar?
I guess it's cheaper than a piano player.

06:15.105 --> 06:18.475
This is predictable.
Making jokes to mask the pain.

06:18.651 --> 06:21.320
I don't understand.

06:21.487 --> 06:24.820
I'm moving into Frasier's
fashionable townhouse.

06:24.990 --> 06:27.114
Where's Frasier moving to?

06:28.243 --> 06:31.161
You're being deliberately opaque...

06:31.330 --> 06:34.284
Frasier, he's making a joke.

06:34.458 --> 06:36.783
Shoot.

06:39.504 --> 06:41.912
You two will be shacked up together?

06:42.090 --> 06:44.130
Yes, I decided it was time.

06:44.301 --> 06:48.678
What spoiled an evening with Diane
was having to say good night.

06:48.847 --> 06:52.679
Really? That was one of my highlights.

06:52.851 --> 06:54.890
We know how much this hurts you,

06:55.061 --> 06:57.896
but your defensiveness is annoying.

06:58.064 --> 07:01.564
I don't know what you
expected me to do when you told me,

07:01.735 --> 07:05.435
but this doesn't bother me.
I am very happy for you kids.

07:05.613 --> 07:08.697
Thank you, Sam.
We couldn't be happier.

07:08.866 --> 07:14.536
The only thing standing in the way of a
total commitment is Pavlov's response.

07:14.705 --> 07:17.659
You see, that's my little joke, Sam.

07:17.833 --> 07:22.294
Pavlov is my dog, you see,
and I couldn't resist the witticism.

07:22.463 --> 07:26.377
- Let me explain. Pavlov...
- I know all about Pavlov.

07:26.550 --> 07:30.002
Drooling at the sound of a dinner bell.

07:30.179 --> 07:33.714
I've done that before,
but I never knew what to call it.

07:34.933 --> 07:42.181
I had a puppy once. My ex-wife took her.
Little bitch. About this high.

07:44.151 --> 07:47.271
Frasier,
we left Carla's present in the car.

07:47.446 --> 07:50.363
I'll get it.
I hope I remember where I parked.

07:50.532 --> 07:53.533
I'm inebriated with joy over this situation.

07:53.702 --> 07:56.537
Or else the sake made me crocky.

07:58.665 --> 08:00.704
Nobody told me he was funny.

08:00.875 --> 08:02.915
Now you know why.

08:05.547 --> 08:08.547
It's pretty exciting news.

08:08.716 --> 08:13.378
- Yes, we felt it was time.
- I wish you all the luck in the world.

08:15.849 --> 08:17.888
Because we'll need it?

08:18.058 --> 08:22.436
You're a pair made in heaven.
I don't care what the sceptics say,

08:22.605 --> 08:27.232
I say the two of you will last...
Let's see, what time is it now?

08:28.319 --> 08:32.697
Sam, you're hurting now, aren't you?
Admit it.

08:33.698 --> 08:38.408
It's not surprising that you're bitter.
I never took this step with you,

08:38.578 --> 08:42.826
but what Frasier and I have together
is more substantial.

08:43.000 --> 08:48.243
What you and I had was exciting,
tempestuous at times,

08:48.422 --> 08:50.664
but there was no future in it.

08:50.841 --> 08:54.625
You've got to be careful
about that excitement stuff.

08:54.803 --> 09:00.805
Too much of that and soon you're
starting to expect life to be enjoyable.

09:00.975 --> 09:05.602
Then one day you wake up and all those
years of pleasure have gone by

09:05.772 --> 09:08.892
and what have you got to show for it?
Happiness.

09:11.069 --> 09:13.109
How true.

09:14.197 --> 09:16.984
Here it is. Where's our birthday girl?

09:17.158 --> 09:19.696
In the back. She'll be out in a minute.

09:19.869 --> 09:21.909
Sam, would you call her?

09:22.080 --> 09:25.780
I've lots to do.
I want to start moving my clothes in.

09:25.958 --> 09:28.414
Do you have enough closet space?

09:28.586 --> 09:30.745
Loads. Don't worry about that.

09:30.922 --> 09:34.041
Frasier and Diane here
have a gift for you.

09:34.216 --> 09:38.166
- Be still, my heart.
- Many happy returns, Carla.

09:38.346 --> 09:42.178
- Beautiful wrapping.
- Yes, Coach, exquisite wrapping.

09:42.350 --> 09:44.556
Now, let's get to the joke.

09:51.191 --> 09:55.854
- Diane, these are beautiful.
- Frasier picked them out.

09:56.030 --> 09:57.938
Thank you.

09:58.114 --> 10:02.195
- How about vino to break them in?
- Yeah, I want to make a toast.

10:02.369 --> 10:07.992
I want to toast the two people who had
enough class to get me a real gift.

10:08.166 --> 10:11.084
To Diane and Frasier.

10:21.638 --> 10:28.139
No matter how many times I give
fine-dribble crystal, I never tire of it.

10:35.401 --> 10:39.150
So how's it going, Carla?

10:39.322 --> 10:45.609
Fine. But don't think I don't appreciate
busy guys like you caring enough to ask.

10:49.206 --> 10:51.911
She's still sore about the gag gifts.

10:52.084 --> 10:56.082
She's more than sore.
She's hurt, offended and resentful.

10:56.255 --> 11:00.418
If she were wearing dirty bunny
slippers, she could be Vera.

11:03.428 --> 11:08.221
It's our fault.
We could have got her something nice.

11:08.392 --> 11:13.350
It's not too late. We can still give her
a surprise. Just buy her a real gift.

11:13.522 --> 11:16.227
Well, I'm a knowledgeable shopper.

11:16.400 --> 11:19.519
I'll take charge of
Operation Make-Good.

11:19.694 --> 11:25.199
We sure we want Cliff to handle this?
He's likely to buy something tasteless.

11:25.367 --> 11:28.617
Yeah, but none of us
will know the difference.

11:29.620 --> 11:31.697
Cliffie, you're our man.

11:36.628 --> 11:39.996
Afternoon, everyone.
Isn't it a beautiful day?

11:40.173 --> 11:44.467
- How are the new living arrangements?
- Like a charm.

11:48.723 --> 11:51.676
I don't know why we didn't do it
from the start.

11:51.851 --> 11:55.469
- ls that right?
- I couldn't be happier, absolutely.

11:59.650 --> 12:03.350
- Diane...
- Yeah, I know, I'm sorry.

12:03.529 --> 12:07.029
You'll have to excuse that.
I have some...

12:07.199 --> 12:11.528
...some kind of an itch,
sort of in the back of my throat.

12:11.703 --> 12:13.945
Have you ever had one of those?

12:15.791 --> 12:21.129
Boy, it's almost as if it's inside my ear,
but not there either. You know?

12:21.297 --> 12:24.665
That must be maddening.
Let me get you the ice pick.

12:27.219 --> 12:31.003
I was sneezing all morning.
At least that's stopped.

12:31.181 --> 12:36.555
- I wonder what causes it.
- That adorable puppy of Frasier's.

12:36.728 --> 12:40.891
- Little Pavlov?
- She's very sweet, but I'm a cat person.

12:41.065 --> 12:44.648
I obviously have some kind
of an allergy to dogs.

12:44.819 --> 12:48.484
- Are you sure it's the dog?
- What else could it be?

12:48.656 --> 12:51.906
You've been around that dog before.
You must have.

12:52.076 --> 12:56.703
Moving in with Frasier
is a big commitment.

12:56.914 --> 13:02.122
I wonder if this whole so-called allergy
thing might not be psychosomatic.

13:04.881 --> 13:07.585
Sam, I'm very impressed.

13:07.758 --> 13:11.507
That's a complex psychological concept
coming from a man

13:11.679 --> 13:15.546
who has to write L and R
on the bottom of his shoes.

13:17.893 --> 13:22.887
- Does that mean you agree with me?
- Don't be ridiculous.

13:23.065 --> 13:29.779
I just had this thought. Could it be that
you still love somebody from your past?

13:31.156 --> 13:34.157
- You?
- Well, not necessarily.

13:34.326 --> 13:36.947
It could have been Sumner or anybody,

13:37.120 --> 13:40.702
but isn't it interesting
that I spring to mind?

13:40.873 --> 13:46.034
No. You automatically spring to mind
whenever I hear something stupid.

13:47.923 --> 13:50.876
- Hello, my dearest darling.
- Frasier!

13:52.176 --> 13:56.803
Gesundheit. l've reconsidered.
I was unyielding this morning.

13:56.973 --> 14:00.840
I realise your happiness comes first.
I must give up Pavlov.

14:01.018 --> 14:05.265
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

14:05.439 --> 14:08.642
I can't just put the little tyke
out on the streets.

14:08.901 --> 14:12.686
I've must find the best home.
That's a lengthy process.

14:12.864 --> 14:16.446
- I'll take her.
- Frasier, I realise that this may...

14:16.617 --> 14:19.820
If the dog' s the only thing
standing between you,

14:19.995 --> 14:24.492
then if I take her away,
everything will be fine for Diane, right?

14:24.667 --> 14:27.917
I love dogs.
I'll give her a great home. I will.

14:28.087 --> 14:33.081
There we are, then. Done, Sam,
done and by golly, done. She's yours.

14:33.259 --> 14:37.172
Good. That should clear
just about everything up.

14:37.345 --> 14:41.046
I should say so.
We're mighty grateful too. Aren't we?

14:41.225 --> 14:44.724
Yes. ln fact, do you want
to hear something funny?

14:44.895 --> 14:49.271
Just knowing that the dog is going,
I'm already feeling better.

14:49.440 --> 14:51.848
No more allergies.

14:54.946 --> 14:56.773
Gesundheit.

15:08.834 --> 15:13.082
- Hello, Sam.
- Frasier, what can I get you?

15:13.881 --> 15:16.455
I've got a heavy patient load.

15:16.634 --> 15:20.003
Make it a triple stinger
and a beer chaser.

15:20.179 --> 15:22.635
No, let me have a club soda.

15:24.183 --> 15:28.726
Sam, listen. Fill me in.
I'm hungry for news of little Pavlov.

15:28.896 --> 15:32.146
Pavlov? You must mean little Diane.

15:35.528 --> 15:38.529
- I beg your pardon?
- I renamed the puppy Diane.

15:38.697 --> 15:43.691
I figured you wouldn't mind. lt's my
puppy now. I tell you, it's so wonderful.

15:43.868 --> 15:47.320
Any trouble,
I swat her on the rear end and say,

15:47.498 --> 15:51.958
''Shut up, Diane.''
And she does. lt's heaven.

15:55.213 --> 15:58.796
Changing the dog's name
hurts me a little.

15:58.967 --> 16:01.921
Don't you think
two Dianes will be confusing?

16:02.095 --> 16:06.044
Maybe. We'll just have to call
your girlfriend Pavlov.

16:07.392 --> 16:11.057
How are Pavlov's allergies
now that I got Diane?

16:12.146 --> 16:15.230
These things don't clear up overnight.

16:15.399 --> 16:19.693
The latest symptom
is a recurring voice change.

16:19.862 --> 16:23.694
- A what?
- You'll have to hear it.

16:23.866 --> 16:26.487
I don't think words can do it justice.

16:32.332 --> 16:34.372
Where's Carla?

16:35.670 --> 16:38.124
I did it.

16:38.296 --> 16:43.124
I went out.
I got her a great birthday present.

16:43.302 --> 16:46.386
You mean it's Carla's birthday
already again?

16:47.473 --> 16:50.094
The older you get, time goes...

16:50.267 --> 16:54.893
No. This is a real gift
to make up for those gag gifts we got.

16:55.063 --> 16:57.933
A real gift which better be good.

16:59.359 --> 17:01.566
Hi, sweetheart.

17:01.737 --> 17:06.397
Hey, Carla. Many happy returns.

17:06.574 --> 17:13.076
No thanks. No more hilarious gifts, OK?
My sides are still sore from last week.

17:13.248 --> 17:17.411
- Carla, it's a very nice gift.
- Yeah?

17:17.585 --> 17:23.374
What does it do? Explode,
stink, or make disgusting sounds?

17:23.549 --> 17:28.591
No, this is the real gift, Carla,
which better be good.

17:38.981 --> 17:44.189
This is beautiful. I love this. lt's perfect.

17:45.571 --> 17:49.734
This makes up for everything, I think.

17:51.618 --> 17:58.332
It's not easy for me
to say thanks, but thanks, guys.

18:01.420 --> 18:03.459
Way to go, Cliff!

18:04.673 --> 18:07.544
You haven't heard
the best part though.

18:07.718 --> 18:11.086
The longer you wear it,
body heat makes the words,

18:11.263 --> 18:15.925
''l am horny as a hoot owl''
appear right on the back.

18:16.101 --> 18:18.888
Get him out of here.

18:27.987 --> 18:31.688
- See you tomorrow, gang.
- Good night, Cliff.

18:31.866 --> 18:35.317
Excuse me, Sam.
Something's been troubling me.

18:35.494 --> 18:39.872
I gave you the wrong impression
that Diane and I are unhappy.

18:40.041 --> 18:43.990
- No.
- We're going through an adjustment.

18:44.170 --> 18:47.705
In fact, today I think
she's shown some improvement.

18:51.177 --> 18:55.922
- Hello, everyone. Hello, sweetheart.
- Hello, Diane.

19:00.435 --> 19:04.647
- You're going to say gesundheit?
- We've moved past gesundheit.

19:04.815 --> 19:08.433
We're now on our way to
''stuff a sock in it''.

19:10.362 --> 19:13.149
I'm sorry. You know I was joking.

19:13.323 --> 19:16.775
How come you still have allergies
if l've got Diane?

19:17.535 --> 19:21.581
- Diane?
- That's what he calls Pavlov.

19:21.748 --> 19:26.125
Don't ask.
Diane, are you feeling any better?

19:27.879 --> 19:33.502
There are obviously still traces of Pavlov
in the apartment, which I cannot remove.

19:33.677 --> 19:35.087
She's tried.

19:35.261 --> 19:40.468
I've had it fumigated,
I've had all the furniture reupholstered,

19:40.641 --> 19:43.049
I've had the wallpaper steamed off.

19:43.227 --> 19:45.932
Looks darned good, incidentally.

19:46.105 --> 19:49.059
We discovered natural brick on one wall.

19:49.233 --> 19:51.439
The place needed redecorating.

19:51.610 --> 19:55.193
How would you feel
about linoleum in the living room?

19:55.364 --> 19:58.400
- What?
- A lot of people have done it.

19:58.576 --> 20:04.579
- I'm almost sure l've seen pictures...
- That's it! I can't take it any more!

20:04.749 --> 20:09.825
Denial and repression. I devoted
myself professionally to fighting these

20:10.004 --> 20:12.624
and now I'm wading in them upstream.

20:12.798 --> 20:14.956
OK, keep the carpet!

20:15.133 --> 20:19.546
We're both know allergic reactions
are psychosomatic.

20:19.721 --> 20:22.010
There's a thought.

20:24.142 --> 20:28.934
Maybe on some subconscious level,
you don't want to be living with me.

20:29.105 --> 20:33.103
Frasier, it's the dog. I keep telling you.
It's the dog!

20:35.319 --> 20:37.727
The voice.

20:37.905 --> 20:41.489
Diane, the damn dog is gone.

20:41.660 --> 20:46.285
She's halfway across the city!
I don't want to put you through all this.

20:46.455 --> 20:52.161
Frasier, we've made a commitment here.

20:52.336 --> 20:56.085
You're not ready yet
for this kind of commitment.

20:56.257 --> 20:59.424
Perhaps some day you will be.
We'll wait and see.

20:59.594 --> 21:01.752
No, I'm going to make this work.

21:05.850 --> 21:10.346
Diane, please, don't hold on to this
for me. I love you.

21:10.521 --> 21:13.522
But I think your health is more important.

21:14.942 --> 21:16.981
Maybe you're right.

21:17.152 --> 21:22.692
I'm sure I'm right. Now, listen.
Go and gargle and spray your throat.

21:22.866 --> 21:28.109
Use your inhaler, take your antihistamine
and put your nose drops in.

21:28.288 --> 21:32.202
Use whatever else you find
in that pharmacy you call a purse.

21:37.297 --> 21:41.425
Well, Sam, aren't you going to gloat?

21:41.593 --> 21:44.428
I like to think I'm above that, Diane.

21:50.602 --> 21:53.852
Am I nuts, or is that kind of sexy?

21:57.692 --> 22:00.776
Frasier, that's a tough break.

22:00.945 --> 22:04.943
Damn it. I thought we were
going to make it work in a big way.

22:05.116 --> 22:09.196
I bet you do and I bet you do it
pretty soon. Will you excuse me?

22:09.370 --> 22:14.328
- The problem is now I'm entirely alone.
- Yeah, that's tough.

22:14.500 --> 22:17.038
I want my doggy back!

22:18.086 --> 22:21.337
Frasier, l've grown accustomed
to the old girl.

22:21.507 --> 22:24.840
My emotional need for her
is stronger than yours.

22:25.010 --> 22:27.217
- She's mine.
- But I love her.

22:27.388 --> 22:30.922
- Find another one.
- I don't want to talk about this.

22:31.100 --> 22:33.804
Nothing can make me change my mind.

22:33.977 --> 22:37.476
She's mine.
You were just a port in the storm.

22:37.647 --> 22:39.687
I want her and I'll have her.

22:39.858 --> 22:44.900
Don't stand in my way or you'll suffer
my wrath. Do I make myself clear?

22:45.072 --> 22:48.440
Frasier, this is so exciting.

22:49.534 --> 22:55.204
You are the only man to proclaim his
feelings for me with such eloquence.

22:55.373 --> 22:57.946
What we were talking about...

22:58.125 --> 23:01.709
She knows what and who
we were talking about.

23:01.880 --> 23:06.007
She's a clever girl and a beautiful one.

23:07.302 --> 23:12.508
Frasier, do you know that there's
a Kurosawa film festival at Cambridge?

23:12.681 --> 23:15.089
I'm not really in the mood to go...

23:16.185 --> 23:19.056
Kurosawa, you say?

23:19.230 --> 23:22.266
Kurosawa and I'm really in the mood.

23:22.441 --> 23:25.976
I could see his films again and again...

23:26.153 --> 23:30.234
Sam, could I have the afternoon off,
please?

23:30.408 --> 23:34.701
You wouldn't want to stand between me
and Diane and ''The Seven Samurai''?

23:34.870 --> 23:38.820
No. I hope all nine of you
have a wonderful time.

23:49.300 --> 23:56.134
Sammy, Frasier walks out of here with
Diane and you get to go home to a dog.

23:57.100 --> 24:00.433
Yeah, somebody up there likes me.

24:01.305 --> 24:07.492
