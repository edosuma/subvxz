01:15.819 --> 01:39.280
passed underneath my board

01:35.099 --> 01:42.579
we can't let that happen

01:39.280 --> 01:45.040
Jesse jason edward you have to control

01:42.579 --> 01:46.359
this topic before it starts Jamie or how

01:45.040 --> 01:48.670
do you want me to handle it

01:46.359 --> 01:51.009
Jason we can't afford to have a panic

01:48.670 --> 01:54.280
anyone hears what this is you know

01:51.009 --> 01:58.750
what'll happen top that just read me

01:54.280 --> 01:59.950
I read you already have its body yeah

01:58.750 --> 02:02.140
I've got it

01:59.950 --> 02:05.170
what are our options not many it's a

02:02.140 --> 02:07.899
good 15 feet moving slowly toward the

02:05.170 --> 02:10.000
beach to any way you can cut it off turn

02:07.899 --> 02:12.969
now the waters too deep into outside the

02:10.000 --> 02:14.530
breakline my move to Jackie what I'll do

02:12.969 --> 02:16.569
is I'll put into the exhaust novel

02:14.530 --> 02:17.590
sounds laughs McCallum affair at it may

02:16.569 --> 02:20.919
be scared away

02:17.590 --> 02:35.659
it's worth a try work for never this

02:20.919 --> 02:41.299
close to a beach i'm on my way

02:35.659 --> 02:43.400
I'm afraid of the movement

02:41.300 --> 03:10.480
stop moving at all must be something

02:43.400 --> 03:24.430
wrong with it

03:10.479 --> 03:27.579
Oh terrible

03:24.430 --> 03:29.080
no I mean you have to tell it to defend

03:27.580 --> 03:34.269
yourself maybe i can understand

03:29.080 --> 03:45.110
mutilated sighs we gotta get some freaks

03:34.269 --> 03:48.170
do something catchy

03:45.110 --> 03:52.250
can't get the image out of my mind it

03:48.169 --> 03:55.729
was so sad so tragic I understand that

03:52.250 --> 03:58.939
we fish to eat when we harvest the ocean

03:55.729 --> 04:00.919
how could anybody do that how could

03:58.939 --> 04:01.849
anybody cut off its fins and just leave

04:00.919 --> 04:06.169
it there to die

04:01.849 --> 04:08.299
it's disgusting some seem to me like any

04:06.169 --> 04:11.208
animal like that to slaughter a great

04:08.300 --> 04:15.860
fish just for its fans is immoral

04:11.209 --> 04:17.779
what about morality just about money

04:15.860 --> 04:20.000
that's right just it's a big market

04:17.779 --> 04:23.719
shocking the completed an aphrodisiac

04:20.000 --> 04:26.209
does that justify it to you guys so that

04:23.720 --> 04:28.850
some guy in New York or hongkong can get

04:26.209 --> 04:32.449
a little help with his girlfriend please

04:28.850 --> 04:36.740
fire box of chocolates

04:32.449 --> 04:38.719
it's not just sex medicinal shark fins

04:36.740 --> 04:39.680
are supposed to stop aging cure certain

04:38.720 --> 04:41.960
illnesses

04:39.680 --> 04:44.300
yes i'm sorry i just cannot get

04:41.959 --> 04:46.639
sentimental about a shark to me it's

04:44.300 --> 04:48.139
like a poisonous snake you see it you

04:46.639 --> 04:50.180
kill it because the next person that

04:48.139 --> 04:52.719
comes along may not be so lucky

04:50.180 --> 04:56.079
tongues

04:52.720 --> 04:57.970
buffalo were killed for their tongues

04:56.079 --> 04:58.810
and their entire carcasses left there to

04:57.970 --> 05:00.730
rot

04:58.810 --> 05:02.860
this isn't about harvesting you guys

05:00.730 --> 05:05.620
it's about slaughtering and you're right

05:02.860 --> 05:07.689
it is about money and that is exactly

05:05.620 --> 05:11.680
what makes it so disgusting because it's

05:07.689 --> 05:16.000
also about murdering and mutilation and

05:11.680 --> 06:32.639
it's wrong and it's not just wrong it's

05:16.000 --> 07:27.029
evil just evil

06:32.639 --> 07:30.180
ok

07:27.029 --> 07:32.729
you okay you mentioned that the Sharks

07:30.180 --> 07:34.860
won't go away get out of my head right

07:32.730 --> 07:37.500
now when I assume he's alive but he's

07:34.860 --> 07:42.629
like noodley well maybe he's looking for

07:37.500 --> 07:44.879
your help you think so i don't know i

07:42.629 --> 07:46.529
mean it's very possible but i still

07:44.879 --> 08:02.649
think you should talk to someone

07:46.529 --> 08:05.619
let's get out i don't want to be here

08:02.649 --> 08:10.989
Jesse what are you doing following the

08:05.620 --> 08:12.430
money money for what the shark fins you

08:10.990 --> 08:14.259
want to know how something works all you

08:12.430 --> 08:17.050
have to do is follow the money

08:14.259 --> 08:21.759
who's buying who's selling and what's

08:17.050 --> 08:30.728
being paid and then what stopped him

08:21.759 --> 08:37.830
Jesse Jesse what getting carried away we

08:30.728 --> 08:42.389
have our own work to do right

08:37.830 --> 08:43.230
right just curious you know will forget

08:42.389 --> 08:45.870
about it

08:43.230 --> 08:50.159
that's not our job or lifeguards not a

08:45.870 --> 08:52.049
college is not an environmentalist right

08:50.159 --> 08:54.000
so what's up for today

08:52.049 --> 08:58.079
you know me and ali are on jet ski

08:54.000 --> 09:00.929
patrol and can do great you know me

08:58.080 --> 09:03.810
that's it we are fascinated by the mark

09:00.929 --> 09:06.809
we everyone loves Shark Week on the

09:03.809 --> 09:08.639
Discovery Channel but it's more people

09:06.809 --> 09:11.339
like us people working on the water

09:08.639 --> 09:15.240
probably because we know he's down there

09:11.340 --> 09:16.800
you know what I think it's like you know

09:15.240 --> 09:18.389
that feeling you sometimes have when you

09:16.799 --> 09:20.969
look down from the ledge a tall building

09:18.389 --> 09:24.929
now that you're gonna fall but that you

09:20.970 --> 09:29.730
want to jump that morbid fascination you

09:24.929 --> 09:31.829
ever get that feeling okay i know it's

09:29.730 --> 09:32.940
weird but I equate that to my feeling

09:31.830 --> 09:35.490
about sharks

09:32.940 --> 09:38.280
I would love to be in the water with a

09:35.490 --> 09:40.769
shark a big tiger and not in a cage

09:38.279 --> 09:43.379
alongside it

09:40.769 --> 09:52.490
this great predator to feel its energy

09:43.379 --> 09:56.460
and power to make that sound sexual

09:52.490 --> 10:00.779
isn't that interesting

09:56.460 --> 10:05.129
rips you up to see it more than i

10:00.779 --> 10:07.829
expected understand I mean I'm not

10:05.129 --> 10:15.029
emotional about that seen it and moulds

10:07.830 --> 10:18.360
humans this this was different comic or

10:15.029 --> 10:22.110
the Sharks are spiritual and sisters

10:18.360 --> 10:28.570
that watch over living descendants to

10:22.110 --> 10:34.339
our solution said it was sharp

10:28.570 --> 10:36.710
so I felt so torn apart perhaps

10:34.339 --> 10:38.870
what do you mean perhaps

10:36.710 --> 10:40.009
I mean he said my mom was hot in the

10:38.870 --> 10:43.039

than that people see Jesse you think

16:44.700 --> 16:50.340
beautiful California athletic but

16:48.029 --> 16:52.709

16:50.340 --> 16:55.950
see it often but when it comes it's

16:52.710 --> 16:57.210
scary certain things set her off like a

16:55.950 --> 17:00.330
shot concept

versus evil right against wrong

17:05.250 --> 17:11.430
protecting the innocent shock innocent

17:08.400 --> 17:13.769
and Jesse's eyes it's an injustice she's

17:11.430 --> 17:16.230
gonna sit right regardless of the cops

17:13.769 --> 17:19.858
stopped Carlos of the cost of her yeah

just tablet

26:06.179 --> 26:24.980
ok

26:23.329 --> 26:29.308
let's find this guy who dumped the child

26:24.980 --> 26:33.120
and make sure he never does it again

26:29.308 --> 26:34.769
chasing this guy's a waste of time

26:33.119 --> 26:36.869
you've got to be in the harbor just past

26:34.769 --> 26:38.549
those clips he grabbed me on the jetski

26:36.869 --> 26:40.558
left me in the middle of the ocean i

26:38.549 --> 26:42.750
guarantee you he called the Coast Guard

26:40.558 --> 26:44.759
from a landline the minute he got in

26:42.750 --> 26:46.650
said that his radio without talking

26:44.759 --> 26:48.119
about some crazy woman on a jet ski and

26:46.650 --> 26:49.470
made up some excuse why you couldn't

26:48.119 --> 26:50.639
help you what's going to be your word

26:49.470 --> 26:52.160
against his

26:50.640 --> 26:55.130
what about the shark fin

26:52.160 --> 26:56.600
just isn't illegal maybe it should be

26:55.130 --> 26:57.740
and we should do something about what

26:56.599 --> 26:59.629
what are you gonna do

26:57.740 --> 27:00.890
look no matter how much you eat here for

26:59.630 --> 27:04.679
how much he deserves it there's nothing

27:00.890 --> 27:10.230
you can do

27:04.679 --> 27:11.820
maybe I can accept that it's wrong

27:10.230 --> 27:15.240
there are a lot of things that are wrong

27:11.819 --> 27:23.079
in the school we can't fix them all but

27:15.240 --> 27:34.669
