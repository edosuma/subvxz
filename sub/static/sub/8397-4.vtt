00:02.120 --> 00:04.919
I need what I asked for...today.

00:05.960 --> 00:07.919
Or we'll pop round, pay Jenny a visit.

00:08.840 --> 00:09.799
Whatever he was doing,

00:09.920 --> 00:14.239
he didn't want anyone else to know
he was doing it. Tell me that's not dirty.

00:14.360 --> 00:18.439
He's making a decision on the roll
of a dice. Who to kill, when to kill...

00:18.560 --> 00:20.679
...whether or not to kill.

00:23.920 --> 00:25.279
Jenny.

00:30.360 --> 00:32.119
I'm sorry.

00:32.240 --> 00:34.239
I'm really, really sorry.

00:42.920 --> 00:46.639
- Justin, I can't talk tonight.
- We've got another one.

00:46.760 --> 00:49.039
It's started again.
There's two of them.

01:06.920 --> 01:09.279
Somebody stop him!

01:19.680 --> 01:21.479
Somebody stop that man!

02:16.760 --> 02:22.479
♪ Love is like a sin, my love

02:24.080 --> 02:30.199
♪ For the ones that feel it the most

02:31.280 --> 02:36.319
♪ Look at her with her eyes like a flame

02:38.440 --> 02:43.279
♪ She will love you
like a fly will never love you. ♪

03:00.400 --> 03:01.719
I've got to go to work.

03:01.840 --> 03:04.399
- Oh.
- Yes, I have to.

03:05.600 --> 03:08.479
Cos if I don't show up,
they're gonna wonder why.

03:09.520 --> 03:11.119
Can't afford that.

03:14.880 --> 03:18.319
The police are not our biggest worry
right now.

03:19.480 --> 03:21.599
Toby's grandmother is.

03:23.600 --> 03:24.639
We have to move his car.

03:49.040 --> 03:50.239
Hey.

03:51.360 --> 03:52.439
Oi.

03:52.560 --> 03:54.919
I know what you're going through.

03:56.720 --> 03:58.319
I don't think you do.

04:00.280 --> 04:03.359
- I just...
- Only two things matter right now.

04:03.480 --> 04:06.239
And one...is, this was self-defence.

04:06.360 --> 04:08.239
And two...

04:10.240 --> 04:12.159
...I'll never let anyone hurt you.

04:12.280 --> 04:14.239
Ever.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.719
Now, Toby's car is still downstairs.

04:20.839 --> 04:21.999
I don't think I can do that.

04:22.120 --> 04:25.919
Jenny, listen to me. When we're scared,
we don't think straight.

04:26.040 --> 04:27.159
Are you scared?

04:27.280 --> 04:28.719
Yeah.

04:28.840 --> 04:31.799
But if we act like scared people,
we're gonna get caught.

04:31.920 --> 04:33.239
We don't want that, do we?

04:33.360 --> 04:35.159
No.

04:35.280 --> 04:39.079
So I'm gonna need you to help me carve
some time to think this thing through.

04:39.200 --> 04:40.559
Yeah?

04:40.680 --> 04:42.199
What about him?

04:45.120 --> 04:47.759
All right.

04:47.880 --> 04:52.319
Listen to me. Jenny, while I'm gone,
you've got to clean this place.

04:52.440 --> 04:54.719
Use the stuff in this bucket.

04:55.840 --> 04:57.599
OK? Get rid of the bucket.

04:57.720 --> 05:00.639
And I'll be back as soon as I can, OK?

05:13.160 --> 05:15.319
- I know what I saw.
- I'm not saying you don't.

05:15.440 --> 05:17.759
- So what was Luther doing?
- I don't know.

05:17.880 --> 05:19.639
- But you asked him?
- I did, yeah.

05:19.760 --> 05:21.959
Well, what did he say?
"Not to worry, just a misunderstanding"?

05:22.080 --> 05:24.239
At which point, you rolled over
and let him tickle your tummy.

05:24.360 --> 05:26.439
- It wasn't like that.
- Then what was it like?

05:26.560 --> 05:29.919
You've gotta help me, Justin. I'm twisting
in the wind here. I don't know what to do.

05:30.040 --> 05:32.959
I don't know which way to turn. I'm asking
for help and you're giving me nothing.

05:34.320 --> 05:35.439
How bad?

05:35.560 --> 05:37.839
Three dead, four injured.

05:37.960 --> 05:39.679
Stab wounds and chemical burns.

05:39.800 --> 05:41.999
This is the last known victim,
Richard Gardiner.

05:42.120 --> 05:45.479
Younger brother, brother's fiancée
among the injured.

05:47.080 --> 05:48.959
- Killer?
- No sign.

05:49.080 --> 05:51.679
SOCO found this a few hundred yards
down that way.

05:51.800 --> 05:53.559
The killer dropped his wallet
in the chase.

05:54.960 --> 05:56.799
No ID, just cash and a keycard.

05:56.920 --> 05:59.399
Do we know to what hotel?

05:59.520 --> 06:01.039
No. There's a lot of myths
about those things.

06:01.160 --> 06:02.919
All they contain is
a check-in and check-out date.

06:03.040 --> 06:05.679
There's no way to identify
the hotel it came from.

06:07.320 --> 06:11.519
So what do you think's going on?
Do you think we've got a copycat?

06:13.400 --> 06:16.319
No, I think we've got two killers
in competition.

06:18.160 --> 06:21.799
If we can find out the rules
to the competition, then we can stop 'em.

06:21.920 --> 06:24.559
Find out what door that opens.

06:24.680 --> 06:27.759
- Sir, show me the other side, please.
- There's an advert on there.

06:27.880 --> 06:30.399
Got anything I can clean that up with?

06:30.520 --> 06:32.479
I'll see if Benny
can do something with it.

06:33.680 --> 06:37.719
- Brothers?
- No. More than that.

06:38.800 --> 06:40.359
They're twins.

06:40.480 --> 06:43.359
Twins with a shared psychosis.

06:43.480 --> 06:45.799
Turning one will not be easy.

06:45.920 --> 06:49.039
It might not even be possible
without a map into their heads.

06:49.160 --> 06:51.279
We don't even know what their names are.

06:52.720 --> 06:54.319
- I think you're right.
- About what?

06:54.440 --> 06:56.639
It's a scoring system.

06:56.760 --> 06:59.999
You score a certain amount of points
for who you kill,

07:00.120 --> 07:03.359
and then you get bonuses for
where you kill 'em and how you kill 'em.

07:03.480 --> 07:05.479
So it's a sort of a tally
of experience points.

07:05.600 --> 07:07.079
- Experience points?
- Yeah, a way

07:07.200 --> 07:08.679
to measure your progress
through a game.

07:08.800 --> 07:13.359
So...these men are...

07:13.480 --> 07:17.159
killing with hammers, knives, acid,

07:17.280 --> 07:21.879
because they have yet to score enough
points to graduate to better weapons?

07:22.000 --> 07:24.599
- That's definitely a possibility, yeah.
- And when this man

07:24.720 --> 07:28.119
has bludgeoned and stabbed
enough people to death,

07:28.240 --> 07:34.079
then he qualifies to kill even more people
with, what - guns, bombs?

07:34.200 --> 07:36.399
We'll catch him
before it gets to that point.

07:36.520 --> 07:38.639
- Ideas as to how?
- We've got this.

07:38.760 --> 07:41.119
- We think it's an encrypted password.
- To what?

07:41.240 --> 07:44.719
- If we can decode it, we can tell you.
- What do you need?

07:44.840 --> 07:47.039
Well, it's a non-repeating,
randomised sequence.

07:47.160 --> 07:49.839
- Like a book code?
- Exactly like an old book code.

07:49.960 --> 07:50.919
To break the code...

07:51.040 --> 07:53.159
We need to know the book
he's used to make the encryption.

07:53.280 --> 07:55.359
But not just the right title,
we need the exact edition.

07:55.480 --> 07:59.199
So it's the password,
is the way into this.

08:03.120 --> 08:04.679
- What have you got?
- Er, the advert's

08:04.800 --> 08:06.279
for the Frangipani restaurant.

08:06.400 --> 08:08.079
I'm checking with the owners
to see if they can remember

08:08.200 --> 08:09.719
which hotel advertised them
on their keycards.

08:09.840 --> 08:11.319
Find it, call me and I'll meet you there.

08:11.440 --> 08:13.319
- Will do.
- I won't be long.

08:15.040 --> 08:17.039
Er, Mr Kasemsarn?

08:17.160 --> 08:19.719
This is DS Gray from
the Serious and Serial Crimes Unit.

08:19.840 --> 08:23.839
I'm enquiring about an advert
you put out on a hotel keycard.

08:37.880 --> 08:39.639
You know what you're doing
and where you're going?

08:39.760 --> 08:40.799
I think so.

08:40.919 --> 08:43.879
What if I get stopped?
Does this look like it's my car?

08:44.000 --> 08:45.719
Don't get stopped, all right?

08:45.840 --> 08:47.679
Buy some SIM cards.

08:47.800 --> 08:50.079
Don't use one SIM card more than once.

08:52.600 --> 08:55.839
If you do get stopped,
don't say a word, not even your name.

08:55.960 --> 08:58.239
Tell the duty solicitor to call me
and I'll come get you.

08:58.360 --> 08:59.959
Okey-dokey.

09:00.080 --> 09:01.599
Oi! Don't get stopped.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.599
All right, go on, then.

09:06.600 --> 09:08.359
Easy on the accelerator.

09:13.560 --> 09:16.559
All right, go on. Put your seatbelt on!

11:13.400 --> 11:15.039
Not very good, are you, Frank?

11:15.160 --> 11:18.519
No, but apparently it's what you do
when you get to my age.

11:18.640 --> 11:21.279
So what happened to your pet polecat?

11:22.320 --> 11:23.919
How do you mean?

11:24.040 --> 11:25.519
Where's Toby?

11:25.640 --> 11:27.079
He didn't show?

11:28.440 --> 11:30.679
What can I say?
The kid's an embarrassment.

11:30.800 --> 11:33.399
Do me a favour, Frank.
You tell him

11:33.520 --> 11:36.359
I need more time,
more consultation

11:36.480 --> 11:38.359
and way better manners.

11:54.040 --> 11:55.079
Sir.

12:00.880 --> 12:02.959
Right, good news is, we found this laptop.

12:03.080 --> 12:04.839
Oh, yeah? So what's the bad news?

12:04.960 --> 12:06.199
We need to find a particular book

12:06.320 --> 12:07.839
- to break the password, yeah?
- Yeah.

12:07.960 --> 12:09.879
- Yeah, well, wait till you see this.

12:20.400 --> 12:21.719
It'll take weeks.

12:23.080 --> 12:24.799
But it's not right, though, is it?

12:24.920 --> 12:26.759
Not right, how?

12:26.880 --> 12:31.359
Well, I mean, in order for a book code
to work, you need the exact edition.

12:31.480 --> 12:33.039
That way, if you lose your book...

12:33.160 --> 12:34.799
You can get another copy
of the exact same edition.

12:34.920 --> 12:38.719
Right, but all this, this lot here,
this is all

12:38.840 --> 12:41.879
second-hand junk shop copies, innit?
I mean, how are you gonna get

12:42.000 --> 12:43.479
an exact copy of that?

12:44.760 --> 12:47.399
Eh? Or...or that?

12:49.960 --> 12:51.359
No.

13:01.040 --> 13:02.679
I need to see another room.

13:19.360 --> 13:20.559
Gideon's Bible.

13:20.680 --> 13:23.759
There's one of these in every hotel room
in the country.

13:25.800 --> 13:28.119
The key to breaking that code
is in this book.

13:29.360 --> 13:31.319
Get that and that laptop back to Benny.

13:35.080 --> 13:37.959
Are you...
You know, are things all right?

13:38.080 --> 13:39.959
You solve your problem?

13:42.480 --> 13:43.839
I'm on top of it.

13:46.680 --> 13:48.479
I'll meet you back at the shop.

14:03.640 --> 14:05.119
Toby's missing.

14:06.160 --> 14:07.599
What do you mean, he's missing?

14:07.720 --> 14:09.839
Nobody's seen him since yesterday.

14:09.960 --> 14:12.439
That's not missing. That's...late.

14:12.560 --> 14:13.759
Not for Toby.

14:13.880 --> 14:15.519
He's had an argument with Frank,

14:15.640 --> 14:18.919
so he's probably embarrassed,
had a drink

14:19.040 --> 14:21.439
and decided
to screw himself into a coma.

14:21.560 --> 14:23.159
What kind of argument with Frank?

14:23.280 --> 14:26.839
You can't blame Frank.
I mean, he was doing a decent job.

14:26.960 --> 14:29.199
Toby...Toby is out of control.

14:35.280 --> 14:37.279
Best I can do
is keep my ear to the ground

14:37.400 --> 14:38.639
and if I hear anything,
I'll let you know.

14:38.760 --> 14:39.999
- Yeah, you do that.
- All right.

14:54.480 --> 14:55.119
John?

14:55.240 --> 14:57.919
Listen, I need you
to get out of the flat now.

14:58.040 --> 15:00.559
- But I haven't finished.
- Finish and get out.

15:00.680 --> 15:03.039
- Do they know?
- They know something's not right.

15:03.160 --> 15:05.159
- What if they find him?
- They won't find him.

15:05.280 --> 15:08.439
- But what if they do?
- I need you to get out of the flat,

15:08.560 --> 15:10.679
keep your head down for a while, OK?

17:31.120 --> 17:32.319
Sorry, Toby.

18:10.640 --> 18:11.759
Wotcha!

18:17.680 --> 18:19.999
Frank, what are you doing here?

18:20.120 --> 18:23.159
Waiting for you.
What are you doing here?

18:27.200 --> 18:29.159
What's in the boot, John?

18:29.280 --> 18:31.519
None of your business
what's in my boot.

18:31.640 --> 18:33.639
Open it.

18:33.760 --> 18:37.159
So what are you saying,
I open the boot or you shoot me?

18:37.280 --> 18:39.919
- Don't make me answer that.
- Frank, you really wanna do this?

18:40.960 --> 18:42.239
All right.

18:42.360 --> 18:44.799
All right. You win.

18:48.120 --> 18:49.159
Step back.

18:54.680 --> 18:57.319
- What's in that bag?
- It's my work gear, all right?!

18:57.440 --> 18:58.519
My stabby, my body armour.

18:58.640 --> 19:00.599
- Zip it open.
- Come on, Frank!

19:00.720 --> 19:02.039
Just do it!

19:20.320 --> 19:21.879
What a performance.

19:24.440 --> 19:26.799
You happy now, Frank?

19:26.920 --> 19:29.039
Listen, I'm gonna go now.

19:29.160 --> 19:32.199
Before you embarrass yourself
with another senior moment,

19:32.320 --> 19:33.839
why don't you do yourself a favour?

19:33.960 --> 19:36.999
Find your boy, slap him,
take him back to his nan.

19:37.120 --> 19:39.919
And while you're at it,
you give him a slap from me.

19:40.040 --> 19:42.639
I'm about done with all this.

19:48.720 --> 19:49.879
Shit!

19:53.880 --> 19:55.879
What do you want?

19:56.000 --> 19:57.559
To help you out.

19:57.680 --> 19:59.439
I've heard that one before.

19:59.560 --> 20:01.079
I'm still laughing.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.399
Listen, you've got bigger things
to worry about.

20:04.760 --> 20:07.479
What do you mean?
I don't know what you mean.

20:07.600 --> 20:13.359
It means, I want five minutes alone
with Jenny, ask her some questions.

20:13.480 --> 20:16.679
She's not in trouble -
I just need a chat, that's all.

20:16.800 --> 20:20.999
You help me get that and I'm out of
your hair for good. So's John Luther.

20:21.120 --> 20:22.399
Right.

20:22.520 --> 20:25.319
And how do you intend
to make that happen?

20:27.680 --> 20:29.879
- How do you think?
- Oh.

20:32.200 --> 20:33.319
Look...

20:33.440 --> 20:34.919
she's not here.

20:36.440 --> 20:38.319
I don't know where she is.

20:59.040 --> 21:00.519
How did I do?

21:02.320 --> 21:03.919
Did I do OK?

21:04.040 --> 21:05.399
You did great.

21:09.160 --> 21:10.679
Did great.

21:10.800 --> 21:12.119
Well done.

21:12.240 --> 21:13.399
All right?

21:13.520 --> 21:16.159
But this isn't over.

21:16.280 --> 21:17.519
Not yet.

21:20.320 --> 21:22.439
I need you to find a place to hide.

21:22.560 --> 21:24.239
Think you can do that?

21:27.960 --> 21:29.959
Think I might want my mum.

21:31.960 --> 21:34.359
Jenny, I don't think
you should go back there.

21:34.480 --> 21:36.319
But if it makes you feel better...

21:39.480 --> 21:40.879
You're so nice.

21:42.040 --> 21:43.639
Why aren't you married?

21:46.600 --> 21:47.999
You should be, though.

21:50.080 --> 21:51.599
You should be married.

21:53.360 --> 21:54.839
All happy and everything.

21:56.800 --> 21:58.599
No-one'll have me.

22:00.880 --> 22:01.879
Go on.

22:03.080 --> 22:04.399
Let's go.

24:10.280 --> 24:12.439
- When did it happen?
- Six minutes.

24:12.560 --> 24:14.319
- Uniform got there two minutes ago.
- And the killer?

24:14.440 --> 24:16.479
He ran onto Lyntall Street, but he could
be north, south, anywhere, really.

24:16.600 --> 24:19.079
- How we doing with the rest of it?
- Warm off the press.

24:20.320 --> 24:21.679
All right, cool.

24:21.800 --> 24:23.159
Excellent.

24:23.280 --> 24:25.479
- Get that other stuff and get in here.
- OK.

24:27.320 --> 24:30.519
Your password was pretty secure.

24:33.480 --> 24:34.919
Cracked it.

24:40.520 --> 24:43.199
Liverpool Street, this happened.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.879
See, what he's done,
to compensate for a low-scoring weapon,

24:49.000 --> 24:52.079
- he's used a high-scoring strategy.
- Mm.

24:52.200 --> 24:55.799
Then this. People carrier. Broad daylight.

24:55.920 --> 24:59.519
Males, right -
that's good, isn't it, males?

24:59.640 --> 25:01.599
Um...loads of witnesses.

25:01.720 --> 25:05.279
- Again, another high-scoring tactic.
- His name's Nicholas.

25:07.160 --> 25:08.879
Your name's Robert.

25:14.800 --> 25:19.079
The Japanese have got a great word
for it, "hikikomori".

25:19.200 --> 25:22.679
It means people
that withdraw from the world.

25:22.800 --> 25:25.559
That's what you and your brother
have been doing, right?

25:25.680 --> 25:27.199
Now look at you.

25:27.320 --> 25:29.399
Banged up, in here. Game over.

25:29.520 --> 25:30.879
- While Nick...
- Nicholas.

25:35.040 --> 25:36.839
...Nicholas...

25:36.960 --> 25:38.639
is out there,

25:38.760 --> 25:41.719
making up for all the times
he was the quiet one.

25:43.680 --> 25:46.359
- He's scoring very high for audacity.
- So?

25:46.480 --> 25:48.159
- So what do you think about that?
- What do you think?

25:48.280 --> 25:50.879
Oh, I'll tell you what I think.
I'm glad you asked that.

25:51.000 --> 25:54.199
I think that you and Nicholas
are very, very close.

25:54.320 --> 25:58.159
Outstandingly so, even for twins.

25:58.280 --> 26:00.479
You want to know what else I think?

26:00.600 --> 26:04.719
I think there's a limit
to that closeness.

26:04.840 --> 26:06.119
A limit.

26:07.240 --> 26:10.639
I mean, after all, you are one of two.

26:10.760 --> 26:12.199
Eh, Robert?

26:12.320 --> 26:14.479
You are a man in your own right.

26:14.600 --> 26:17.079
- Do you know what else you are?
- What else am I?

26:17.200 --> 26:19.919
- You're winning.
- I don't care about winning.

26:20.040 --> 26:22.599
You and your brother

26:22.720 --> 26:24.999
get them strangers all right.

26:25.120 --> 26:27.319
But when it's down
to the last men standing,

26:27.440 --> 26:29.479
it's you against him, isn't it, Robert?

26:29.600 --> 26:32.119
And I think you do actually care who wins,

26:32.240 --> 26:35.399
because you really, really want it
to be you.

26:36.640 --> 26:38.279
What are you asking me?

26:38.400 --> 26:42.519
I'm saying that the way Nicholas
is racking up a great score,

26:42.640 --> 26:44.679
you won't be winning
for much longer, will you?

26:44.800 --> 26:47.839
- So?
- So why don't you help me catch him?

26:49.240 --> 26:50.639
Before he beats you.

26:57.440 --> 26:58.759
I'll play you for it.

27:02.040 --> 27:03.839
I can't do that.

27:03.960 --> 27:06.399
Then it isn't going to happen.

27:12.360 --> 27:13.959
What are the rules of the game?

27:14.080 --> 27:15.559
It's a dilemma throw.

27:15.680 --> 27:19.039
That makes it a straight 50/50,
meaning I roll 1 to 10,

27:19.160 --> 27:20.759
I help you catch my brother.

27:20.880 --> 27:23.319
I roll 11 to 20, you're on your own.

27:26.280 --> 27:27.999
Go on, then.

27:48.240 --> 27:50.879
- If you do catch him...
- Yeah?

27:52.680 --> 27:54.359
...tell him I love him.

28:11.440 --> 28:12.759
Sorry.

28:12.880 --> 28:14.439
Don't be.

28:17.200 --> 28:18.839
This is your home.

28:18.960 --> 28:20.959
You're welcome here any time.

28:25.600 --> 28:27.439
Do you want to tell me what's wrong?

28:33.440 --> 28:34.839
Are you on drugs?

28:36.040 --> 28:37.319
Is it drugs again?

28:39.360 --> 28:41.679
Did he hurt you?

28:41.800 --> 28:43.319
Did that man hurt you?

28:43.440 --> 28:44.439
No!

28:45.840 --> 28:47.359
Then what is it, love?

28:51.120 --> 28:53.439
I really want to tell you, but I can't.

28:54.680 --> 28:56.159
Why not?

28:57.760 --> 28:59.239
I just can't.

29:05.960 --> 29:12.279
So, if Nicholas Millberry believed
that his brother had escaped...

29:12.400 --> 29:15.679
This is how he would communicate -
via the blog.

29:15.800 --> 29:19.159
Run it past me -
exactly how do they communicate?

29:19.280 --> 29:21.599
Robert and Nicholas
set up an everyday blog -

29:21.720 --> 29:24.439
by design,
the most boring blog in the world.

29:24.560 --> 29:26.919
All but guaranteed to attract no traffic.

29:27.040 --> 29:28.639
But if it does attract a passer-by...

29:28.760 --> 29:30.199
Well, they password-protected it.

29:30.320 --> 29:31.599
- But you cracked it.
- Benny cracked it.

29:31.720 --> 29:33.559
- By breaking the book code?
- Yeah.

29:33.680 --> 29:37.239
Yeah. Once you're in,
the blog just consists of boring posts.

29:37.360 --> 29:40.279
So what, these posts are coded?

29:40.400 --> 29:41.959
Well, no, they speak via the comments.

29:42.080 --> 29:44.079
Nicholas'll have an RSS feed
on his phone.

29:44.200 --> 29:46.519
So as soon as a new comment's
posted, he'll receive an alert.

29:46.640 --> 29:49.919
Which means we can control
and trace the communications.

29:51.320 --> 29:53.439
Have you got any better ideas?

30:22.520 --> 30:25.279
- Who was that?
- God. Sorry, did I wake you?

30:25.400 --> 30:26.879
No.

30:29.200 --> 30:30.519
So who was it?

30:31.880 --> 30:33.959
- Esther.
- Who?

30:35.600 --> 30:37.039
Esther.

30:37.160 --> 30:40.119
Used to live down the road from us,
on Cavalry Close.

30:40.240 --> 30:41.799
The ginge?

30:41.920 --> 30:43.919
No. Esther.

30:45.480 --> 30:47.519
The one with all the boobs?

30:47.640 --> 30:49.159
That's her.

30:49.280 --> 30:51.559
I was supposed to go over and see her.

30:51.680 --> 30:54.399
But I cancelled for my girl.

30:54.520 --> 30:55.999
Thanks, Mum.

31:21.840 --> 31:25.359
John. I think my mum
may have done something stupid.

31:25.480 --> 31:29.199
Give me two minutes and I'll call you
back as soon as I leave this building.

31:45.200 --> 31:46.319
Where's he going?

31:46.440 --> 31:48.239
He's working the case.

31:49.520 --> 31:52.959
Yeah, in mysterious ways,
his wonders to perform.

31:53.080 --> 31:55.119
Why don't you just cut him some slack?

31:55.240 --> 31:57.359
And this feels right to you, does it?

31:57.480 --> 31:59.879
Deliberately feeding lies to the media.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.759
Because, correct me if I'm wrong,

32:01.880 --> 32:03.559
but it looks like that's what he's doing.

32:03.680 --> 32:06.439
The media don't care if it's lies,
as long as there's a good story in it.

32:06.560 --> 32:09.399
Well, that's not the point, is it?

32:09.520 --> 32:11.599
Can you think of a better way
to get Nicholas Millberry off the streets?

32:25.760 --> 32:28.279
Touch a hair on her head
and I'll rip your balls out.

32:38.440 --> 32:40.959
Don't worry -
you're doing the right thing.

32:41.080 --> 32:42.559
Where is she?

32:44.120 --> 32:45.399
Jen?

32:47.680 --> 32:49.159
Jen!

32:52.920 --> 32:56.879
Genevieve...
can you come out a minute, please?

32:58.520 --> 33:00.239
- Jen?
- Where is she?

33:02.240 --> 33:03.319
I don't know...

33:03.440 --> 33:05.559
I don't know.

33:10.120 --> 33:13.479
What is going on here? If there is
some kind of setup going on here,

33:13.600 --> 33:15.719
you are gonna be the first to suffer,
let me tell you now. Get her for me!

33:15.840 --> 33:17.719
- Get her for me! Where is she?
- I don't know!

33:17.840 --> 33:20.159
- Call her!
- I've been trying. I don't where she is!

33:20.280 --> 33:22.599
- Call her again!
- He's in there. Do I do it now?

33:22.720 --> 33:25.679
Yes. Do it now. Call the police.

33:25.800 --> 33:27.799
- Don't worry about your mum.
- Promise?

33:27.920 --> 33:30.359
If you want to help your mum,
you need to keep it together

33:30.480 --> 33:32.119
and do as we agreed.

33:32.240 --> 33:33.879
And don't go back in there,

33:34.000 --> 33:36.319
cos Frank might not hurt your mum,
but he will hurt you.

33:36.440 --> 33:37.839
- All right?
- OK.

33:37.960 --> 33:41.839
I've got to go. Keep it together, do it.

33:41.960 --> 33:43.999
You all right?

33:44.120 --> 33:47.599
It has to come
from an anonymous police source.

33:47.720 --> 33:51.479
Police, please.
I-I just seen a car pull up to this house.

33:51.600 --> 33:53.999
It's a silver...how do you say it?
Hyund...

33:54.120 --> 33:55.679
Hyundai, yeah.

33:55.800 --> 34:01.359
This bloke got out
and he was holding this gun or something.

34:01.480 --> 34:03.239
No, yeah, it was definitely a gun.

34:04.800 --> 34:07.559
Well, there's this other thing.
I know this might sound a bit mental...

34:07.680 --> 34:09.119
Shut up! All right, listen.

34:09.239 --> 34:11.199
Call your daughter.

34:11.320 --> 34:14.879
Tell her to be back here
in ten minutes

34:15.000 --> 34:18.159
or I am gonna go to work on you.
Have you got that?

34:38.679 --> 34:40.799
Who called the police?
Is there another way out?

34:40.920 --> 34:43.599
Yeah. Up...out there. Up...

35:10.840 --> 35:14.639
- Guv, got a body.
- John, you clever bastard.

35:34.600 --> 35:37.759
- Are we prepped?
- Yeah.

35:37.880 --> 35:41.519
OK, so I've prepared some entries, based
on some of Robert's previous postings.

35:41.640 --> 35:44.519
OK. What does that say?

35:44.640 --> 35:48.359
- Um, hello, basically.
- Hello. Nothing wrong with saying hello.

35:48.480 --> 35:49.559
Were you never young?

35:49.680 --> 35:54.119
- DS Gray...if you wouldn't mind?
- Yes, ma'am.

35:54.240 --> 35:59.199
DS Gray, you apprised me that DCI Luther
used the fire alarm the other day

35:59.320 --> 36:01.559
as a pretext to gain access

36:01.680 --> 36:05.039
to Detective Superintendent Schenk's
personal computer.

36:06.480 --> 36:07.879
Yes, ma'am, I did.

36:08.000 --> 36:13.759
I had IT run a report
on Schenk's computer.

36:16.560 --> 36:18.639
It shows no activity
during the fire alarm.

36:20.400 --> 36:22.719
What angle are you trying to work, Erin?

36:22.840 --> 36:24.679
Is there a plan? I hope you've got a plan,

36:24.800 --> 36:28.079
- this isn't just random game playing.
- Ma'am, I'm confused. I don't...

36:28.200 --> 36:30.199
If you're so keen
to smear a superior officer,

36:30.320 --> 36:33.279
you're gonna have to be smarter than that,
a lot smarter.

36:35.480 --> 36:37.079
Now get out of my sight.

36:37.200 --> 36:38.879
Go for a walk.

36:39.000 --> 36:42.279
Do some serious thinking
about your future in this department...

36:44.160 --> 36:45.719
...and this service.

37:24.120 --> 37:25.279
Sorry.

37:28.240 --> 37:29.839
Once we've posted a comment,

37:29.960 --> 37:32.919
his alert comes in on an RSS feed
on his laptop or his mobile.

37:33.040 --> 37:35.919
As soon as he responds,
I can trace his connection.

37:38.520 --> 37:40.679
- How did you do it?
- How did I do what?

37:40.800 --> 37:44.239
- Guv, come on.
- No, DS Gray, you come on.

37:44.360 --> 37:47.439
Was it you? Did you do it for him?

37:47.560 --> 37:49.039
Um...

37:49.160 --> 37:53.279
Sorry...what he says, Erin.
You lost me at hello.

37:56.400 --> 37:58.639
Erin, what is going on?

38:00.440 --> 38:03.559
The creatures outside looked
from pig to man, and from man to pig,

38:03.680 --> 38:06.079
and still it was impossible to tell...

38:07.320 --> 38:08.639
...which was which.

38:13.440 --> 38:15.519
What was that about?

38:15.640 --> 38:17.639
I'm not sure.

38:17.760 --> 38:20.359
I do know that Carroway had IT

38:20.480 --> 38:22.919
crawling all over Schenk's
computer archives earlier.

38:23.040 --> 38:25.159
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

38:25.280 --> 38:27.599
What do you think he's been up to?

38:27.720 --> 38:31.159
I don't know.
I expect we'll find out soon enough.

38:31.280 --> 38:32.839
Right...

38:32.960 --> 38:34.639
let's get started.

38:34.760 --> 38:36.639
Type in "hello".

38:41.520 --> 38:43.879
Robert Millberry was arrested
and taken into custody

38:44.000 --> 38:46.799
in connection with two brutal attacks
in London two days ago.

38:46.920 --> 38:49.559
Police have refused to comment
on reports that Robert Millberry

38:49.680 --> 38:52.839
escaped from custody today
and is currently at large in the capital.

38:52.960 --> 38:56.319
The story has appeared
in several internet news sites

38:56.440 --> 39:00.519
but no official report has yet been
published by the Metropolitan Police.

39:00.640 --> 39:03.679
Millberry allegedly escaped
from a prisoner transfer van

39:03.800 --> 39:05.439
after overpowering a guard.

39:05.560 --> 39:08.599
Fears are growing that
there's a link between Robert Millberry

39:08.720 --> 39:11.919
and the violent massacre that took place
on a London Underground station

39:12.040 --> 39:13.679
the night of his arrest.

39:42.360 --> 39:43.679
I did it.

39:44.800 --> 39:46.319
You did what, Justin?

39:46.440 --> 39:49.759
Hacked into the database, cleared
all the history on Schenk's computer.

39:49.880 --> 39:53.679
So when Carroway went digging,
there was nothing to find.

39:53.800 --> 39:55.639
Oh...

39:55.760 --> 39:58.439
She was only trying
to do the right thing.

39:58.560 --> 40:01.919
She doesn't deserve
to be punished for it - it's wrong.

40:02.040 --> 40:04.719
- Yeah, it is wrong.
- I need to make it right.

40:04.840 --> 40:06.039
Justin, I will.

40:06.160 --> 40:09.039
Not you, me - I did it,
so I need to make it right.

40:44.920 --> 40:46.999
Right, he's answering. He's live.

40:47.120 --> 40:48.759
All right, Benny, what we got?

40:48.880 --> 40:52.839
Just give me a moment. He's connected
to the blog. I'm tracing his ISP.

40:52.960 --> 40:54.439
Got him.

40:54.560 --> 40:57.119
He's at the Enspire Coffee Bar,
Endymion Way.

40:57.240 --> 41:00.079
John, we're closer than you.
I'll see you there.

41:00.200 --> 41:01.479
All right.

41:01.600 --> 41:03.039
Gotcha.

41:06.040 --> 41:07.639
- All right, what's he saying?
- He's joking,

41:07.760 --> 41:10.599
saying Robert should have stuck
to the no-capture zone.

41:16.240 --> 41:21.479
Benny's asking him what his next move is.
He's typed "SEAL".

41:21.600 --> 41:24.559
- Slaying Everyone And Laughing.
- Stay with him, Benny.

41:27.840 --> 41:28.999
What's he saying now?

41:29.120 --> 41:31.719
Benny's asking him
to be more specific.

41:33.920 --> 41:37.199
OK. "Grinding MOBS".
So he's talking about massacre.

41:49.480 --> 41:51.199
Something's wrong.
He's stopped responding.

41:53.560 --> 41:54.719
Benny, we're almost there.

42:26.040 --> 42:28.839
I don't think he's talking
about knives and hammers, guv.

42:30.520 --> 42:32.639
He's talking about carnage.

42:32.760 --> 42:34.079
We've got to stand these men down.

42:34.200 --> 42:35.399
It's too late.

42:36.440 --> 42:39.879
Nicholas Millberry, do not move!

42:40.000 --> 42:42.119
Police marksmen have you in their sights.

42:42.240 --> 42:47.479
Please stand, placing your hands
slowly on your head.

42:57.800 --> 42:59.839
He's got something under his coat.

42:59.960 --> 43:02.319
It's not right, is it?

43:08.720 --> 43:12.479
- All right, stand down, hold your fire.
- Hold fire!

43:13.560 --> 43:17.159
Right, that's a dead man's switch.

43:17.280 --> 43:21.199
We take a shot,
his hand loosens on the trigger.

43:22.720 --> 43:24.239
Vest detonates.

43:24.360 --> 43:26.159
How big of a blast are we looking at?

43:27.480 --> 43:33.079
Given the bulk of that vest, we're
looking at a hundred-foot kill radius.

43:49.320 --> 43:51.479
Boss, setting up.

44:10.600 --> 44:16.519
Assuming he maintains general bearing,
we need roadblocks here, here, here.

44:16.640 --> 44:20.039
We designate this area the hot zone.

44:20.160 --> 44:22.639
Evacuate buildings
outside the hot zone only.

44:22.760 --> 44:26.159
Minimise bodies on the streets,
clear a space, take him out.

44:26.280 --> 44:30.999
- Take him out? What about the bomb?
- We're clearing the streets as best we...

44:31.120 --> 44:32.799
What about the buildings?
Look at all these buildings round here.

44:32.920 --> 44:36.039
Everybody in the shops and offices
inside this hot zone,

44:36.160 --> 44:37.639
they just fend for themselves?

44:37.760 --> 44:40.799
What's the alternative? Cross your fingers
and hope he walks right out of London?

44:40.920 --> 44:44.439
Much more likely he's got
a target in mind. They usually do.

44:44.560 --> 44:47.239
Say he's en route to a hospital
or planning to blow himself up

44:47.360 --> 44:51.039
- in a primary school, what do we do then?
- If you shoot him, people will die.

44:51.160 --> 44:52.759
The question I have to live with is,

44:52.880 --> 44:55.199
how can I keep that number
as small as possible?

44:55.320 --> 44:56.999
Get out of the square now!

44:57.120 --> 45:00.119
- Come on!
- Fast as you can.

45:00.240 --> 45:02.359
Move it! Leave it! Leave it!

45:31.680 --> 45:35.039
John, I can't intervene, it's not my call,
and part of me thanks God that it's not,

45:35.160 --> 45:37.199
because I don't know
what I would do differently.

45:37.320 --> 45:41.879
Look, um, whatever you've got in mind,
we've got to do it quickly.

47:09.360 --> 47:10.759
What's the plan, then?

47:12.360 --> 47:13.799
There is a plan, right?

47:51.200 --> 47:52.799
Wotcha.

47:57.280 --> 47:58.479
I'm John.

48:00.280 --> 48:03.239
- Do you want to play a game?
- I already am.

48:03.360 --> 48:04.959
Oh, I know.

48:05.080 --> 48:07.999
- He's wired.
- See, I've been reading...

48:08.120 --> 48:09.719
Did we know he was wired?

48:09.840 --> 48:11.279
What have you done?

48:11.400 --> 48:14.959
In order to get to the next level,
you need a lot more points.

48:15.080 --> 48:18.239
And correct me if I'm wrong,
but you need a...a boss.

48:18.360 --> 48:20.279
You need to kill a boss.

48:22.120 --> 48:24.319
I am the man at the end of that level,
aren't I?

48:24.440 --> 48:27.199
I'm the man that's chasing you.
I'm that boss.

48:27.320 --> 48:29.679
So if you beat me,

48:29.800 --> 48:32.199
you get to play on.

48:36.360 --> 48:37.599
You're gonna like this.

48:42.520 --> 48:43.559
Check it out.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.119
Now you roll the dice.

49:14.240 --> 49:17.199
I guess the number -
I beat you...

49:17.320 --> 49:19.759
you disarm that switch.

49:19.880 --> 49:22.039
If I lose...

49:22.160 --> 49:24.639
You're not serious.

49:26.360 --> 49:27.559
Look at me.

49:32.640 --> 49:34.959
Do I look like I'm joking?

49:36.200 --> 49:37.599
OK.

49:43.480 --> 49:45.719
Let's play in there.

50:11.600 --> 50:14.319
Joe, those men are gonna
have to come down from that roof

50:14.440 --> 50:16.439
because they have to have
a clear line of fire.

50:18.160 --> 50:21.279
Joe, I need you to issue that order.

50:24.440 --> 50:26.959
Bring five shooters down from the roof.

50:27.080 --> 50:30.719
Make a perimeter round that truck
and wait.

50:30.840 --> 50:33.359
Have I just authorised the death
of a police officer?

50:42.920 --> 50:46.999
You know...I used to do this thing.

50:47.120 --> 50:49.759
Used to...used to play Russian roulette.

50:49.880 --> 50:51.959
And why was that?

50:52.080 --> 50:53.159
Well...

50:54.480 --> 50:56.439
...I guess because I was scared,
you know.

50:56.560 --> 51:01.559
I could control my actions,
but not the consequences of my actions.

51:01.680 --> 51:03.319
- Does that make any sense to you?
- Yes.

51:03.440 --> 51:07.399
A few weeks ago, I realised that
nobody can...nobody can control that.

51:07.520 --> 51:11.919
An action leads to a reaction
that leads to a reaction

51:12.040 --> 51:14.479
and it all becomes one chaotic system.

51:14.600 --> 51:19.559
That's why I can see how
you and your brother made it simple.

51:19.680 --> 51:21.519
Turned it into a game.

51:22.640 --> 51:24.119
Right?

51:24.240 --> 51:29.879
I can...I can see that, it makes sense
to me. Leave it to fate, to God.

51:30.960 --> 51:32.639
To a roll of the dice.

51:32.760 --> 51:34.759
The rest of that fuel...

51:36.400 --> 51:37.519
...on you.

51:38.600 --> 51:41.399
I mean, it...it's tiny in here.

51:41.520 --> 51:43.839
Just do it.

51:59.880 --> 52:01.519
Yeah.

52:03.160 --> 52:03.879
Roll it.

52:12.880 --> 52:16.439
Well, why don't you
put the detonator down?

52:16.560 --> 52:18.519
Oh, no, I can't do that.

52:18.640 --> 52:20.479
Yes, you can.

52:20.600 --> 52:24.839
Listen to me.
You're at that end, I'm at this end.

52:24.960 --> 52:28.519
I'm covered in fuel
and you have a lighter.

52:32.680 --> 52:33.959
OK.

52:50.560 --> 52:51.759
Close your eyes.

52:58.120 --> 52:59.039
Ready?

52:59.160 --> 53:00.959
Come on!

53:03.560 --> 53:05.159
OK, go.

53:09.000 --> 53:11.079
One guess.

53:15.520 --> 53:16.519
Are you scared?

53:18.240 --> 53:20.359
No, I'm not scared. Are you scared?

53:23.040 --> 53:24.479
No.

53:26.760 --> 53:28.639
So...

53:30.800 --> 53:32.439
...what do you say?

53:36.880 --> 53:38.199
What do you say?

53:38.320 --> 53:41.239
All right, here's what I say.

53:45.840 --> 53:48.559
The A between the L and the R.

53:48.680 --> 53:50.199
Aim low.

53:50.320 --> 53:51.519
What?

53:51.640 --> 53:52.679
You heard the man.

55:18.600 --> 55:20.999
He hated the boy,
but he wouldn't kill him.

55:21.120 --> 55:23.039
I want you to find him.

55:24.160 --> 55:26.119
Find Frank and bring him to me.

55:28.560 --> 55:29.799
No.

55:30.680 --> 55:32.359
No, this is done.

55:32.480 --> 55:33.719
We're done.

55:33.840 --> 55:35.359
That's not for you to say.

55:35.480 --> 55:38.959
You see, you made a mistake
coming to me, cos I'm not Frank.

55:39.080 --> 55:41.719
I never was Frank and I'll never be Frank.

55:41.840 --> 55:42.959
What are you, then?

55:43.080 --> 55:44.839
This is what I am.

55:46.120 --> 55:48.999
I spoke to a good friend of mine
last night.

55:49.120 --> 55:52.919
Now, if anything happens to Jenny
or anything happens to me,

55:53.040 --> 55:56.319
she is gonna come for you
with the wrath of God.

55:56.440 --> 55:58.639
She'll take whatever
you've got left to love

55:58.760 --> 56:01.679
and make you regret the day
you ever came across my path.

56:04.800 --> 56:05.879
Are we done?

56:06.000 --> 56:07.679
We're done.

56:22.880 --> 56:26.719
- You didn't really do that, did you?
- Do what?

56:26.840 --> 56:29.879
Like, call up
some totally psycho killer girl.

56:30.000 --> 56:32.319
- Her name's Alice.
- Whatever.

56:32.440 --> 56:34.559
I don't know. What do you think?

56:34.680 --> 56:36.959
Hmm... Dunno.

56:38.480 --> 56:40.719
I do know you were totally epic, though.

56:42.920 --> 56:44.079
Totally.

57:14.640 --> 57:16.319
So, now what?
