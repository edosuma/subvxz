[Dunbar on TV] <i>...supporting my efforts</i>
<i>to reform the Democratic Party...</i>

01:52.487 --> 01:55.658
<i>and to restore integrity
to the Oval Office.</i>

01:55.741 --> 01:56.784
[Hannah sighing]

01:56.867 --> 02:01.496
<i>Unfortunately, I won't be able
to complete the work I set out to achieve.</i>

02:01.579 --> 02:04.541
<i>It has become clear
that my candidacy has become</i>

02:04.625 --> 02:06.835
<i>a distraction rather than a solution...</i>

02:07.961 --> 02:10.756
<i>that controversy has trumped the issues.</i>

02:13.258 --> 02:15.427
<i>And for that reason,
I am ending my bid...</i>

02:15.510 --> 02:17.137
- [volume increases]
<i>- ...to be the Democratic nominee</i>

02:17.220 --> 02:18.221
<i>for president.</i>

02:18.305 --> 02:21.058
<i>That was Heather Dunbar from her campaign
headquarters in Washington.</i>

02:21.141 --> 02:23.686
<i>With Dunbar out,
that leaves President Underwood</i>

02:23.769 --> 02:25.520
<i>as the presumptive nominee.</i>

02:25.603 --> 02:28.732
<i>The focus now is on
who President Underwood's running--</i>

02:28.816 --> 02:30.984
[electric razor whirring]

02:37.074 --> 02:38.075
Good morning.

02:44.456 --> 02:46.624
- Good morning.
- [chuckles]

02:52.505 --> 02:53.966
[Hannah moans]

02:58.428 --> 03:01.056
[breathing heavily]

03:18.115 --> 03:20.033
[sighing]

03:34.506 --> 03:37.467
- [moans]
- [both breathing heavily]

03:39.845 --> 03:41.221
[Charlie] Mommy?

03:41.805 --> 03:43.724
- [Hannah sighs]
- [both panting]

03:44.599 --> 03:45.809
[Hannah chuckles]

03:52.482 --> 03:54.401
[sighs] Hello, darling.

03:54.484 --> 03:56.862
- I want breakfast.
- You want breakfast?

03:56.945 --> 03:59.823
- Where's Daddy?
- Oh, he's getting ready for work.

03:59.907 --> 04:02.242
- [electric razor whirring]
- I'm gonna cut your hair.

04:02.325 --> 04:04.828
- No! No! No!
- [chuckling] I'm gonna cut your hair.

04:05.746 --> 04:09.707
- No! No! No! No! [laughing]
- [chuckling] What do you mean "no"?

04:09.792 --> 04:13.628
- [laughing] No!
- [Conway growling]

04:13.711 --> 04:15.923
I'm gonna make you a little bald boy.

04:16.005 --> 04:18.841
- No! No, shave Mom's head, not mine!
- Shave Mom's head? Okay.

04:18.926 --> 04:20.343
- [gasps] No! No!
- I'll shave Mom's head.

04:20.427 --> 04:22.429
- [Hannah laughing] No.
- I'll shave Mom's head.

04:22.512 --> 04:24.306
[Charlie and Hannah laughing]

04:31.688 --> 04:33.398
[Claire] We've been moving so quickly.

04:35.358 --> 04:38.987
Maybe we should take a step back.
Think this through again.

04:40.238 --> 04:43.700
We can't afford to be weird
with each other, Claire.

04:44.701 --> 04:45.994
Weird?
What do you mean?

04:47.120 --> 04:50.999
I saw you in the bathroom...
looking at me.

04:52.918 --> 04:54.627
It's not the first time.

04:57.755 --> 05:01.426
Sometimes I want to say something,
I just don't know what to say.

05:02.635 --> 05:05.931
- It's uncomfortable.
- Maybe it will always be like that.

05:07.599 --> 05:11.854
But we have to separate that out.
It can't affect our plan.

05:13.021 --> 05:19.486
Because that's the one thing...
that we have figured out.

05:29.579 --> 05:34.376
When Walker and Vasquez...
betrayed us,

05:34.459 --> 05:37.462
pulled the Secretary of State
right out from under my feet,

05:37.545 --> 05:41.633
there was no room for doubt,
and you made me remember that.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.137
We took a path...

05:46.096 --> 05:49.807
a difficult one, because we had no
guarantee where it was going to lead us.

05:49.892 --> 05:53.145
It took a steel goddamn stomach,

05:53.228 --> 05:55.772
and so has everything else
we had to do since.

05:58.233 --> 06:01.153
So don't worry about you and me now.

06:03.405 --> 06:05.240
Find your steel, Claire.

06:26.553 --> 06:28.513
Thank you all very much for coming.

06:28.596 --> 06:29.932
Have you seen this?

06:30.974 --> 06:32.142
Hmm?

06:33.977 --> 06:37.981
[Brockhart] ICO.
Islamic Caliphate Organization.

06:38.065 --> 06:40.442
Ahmed and Yusuf Al Ahmadi.

06:40.525 --> 06:43.987
They've been smart about keeping split up.
If one dies, the other takes over.

06:44.071 --> 06:46.406
But they're holding
a planning session in northern Syria.

06:46.489 --> 06:47.699
Both are there right now.

06:47.782 --> 06:49.909
[Frank] I got my ass handed to me
over the Jordan Valley.

06:49.993 --> 06:51.744
I'm not gonna launch a missile strike

06:51.828 --> 06:54.456
unless I believe that there's
an overwhelming national security threat,

06:54.539 --> 06:57.375
and I'm just not convinced
that they pose one.

06:57.459 --> 06:59.669
The president believes
ICO to be a serious threat.

06:59.752 --> 07:03.215
We believe they are actively
recruiting American citizens.

07:03.298 --> 07:08.553
Accordingly, the government is requesting
a Section 702 upstream surveillance order.

07:08.636 --> 07:13.100
- Domestic surveillance.
- Monitoring traffic, not individuals.

07:13.183 --> 07:15.018
Approach the bench.

07:15.102 --> 07:17.729
The FISA Court.
Classified rulings behind closed doors.

07:17.812 --> 07:20.357
Not even these men know
we have a lawyer in there this morning.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.151
ICO already has three oil fields
under their control.

07:23.235 --> 07:26.321
They made a fortune selling crude
when Russia cut down production.

07:26.404 --> 07:29.741
It's blowback, sir.
It's our responsibility to address it.

07:31.284 --> 07:35.163
If we launch strikes,
we radicalize even more extremists.

07:35.247 --> 07:37.165
Sir, their army will grow.

07:37.249 --> 07:40.668
The Ahmadis are former Baathists
with strong business ties.

07:40.752 --> 07:43.505
We can cut the head off before
they get bigger if we strike now.

07:43.588 --> 07:45.840
If the threat level increases,
we'll reassess.

07:45.923 --> 07:47.968
[Brockhart] Sir,
we have a very limited window.

07:48.051 --> 07:50.887
General, the president's
made his decision.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.973
[Frank] Thank you very much, gentlemen.

07:54.391 --> 07:58.061
I have rubber-stamped some borderline
requests, Steve, but this is very--

07:58.145 --> 08:01.398
I know. I was surprised, too.
But it's straight from the White House.

08:01.481 --> 08:04.567
Well, this is going to take some time.
I have to do a proper review.

08:04.651 --> 08:09.322
[Claire] This gun was illegally
obtained by a career criminal

08:09.406 --> 08:13.285
at a gun show
where background checks aren't mandatory.

08:14.702 --> 08:18.456
This gun killed Officer Dempsey's partner
at a routine traffic stop.

08:19.832 --> 08:24.129
This one was ordered on the Internet.
No background checks.

08:25.130 --> 08:28.300
This gun killed Bob and Sue Grant's
14-year-old son.

08:31.719 --> 08:36.140
And this is the gun
that killed Agent Edward Meechum.

08:36.224 --> 08:40.312
[Frank] Not many Secret Service agents
buried at Arlington.

08:40.395 --> 08:42.522
I'd say he earned his place.

08:42.605 --> 08:45.900
I took it for granted,
how important he was to me,

08:45.983 --> 08:47.569
how much I leaned on him.

08:48.486 --> 08:51.364
It's clear to me now,
now that he's gone.

08:54.576 --> 08:56.869
I don't wanna make
the same mistake with you, Donald.

08:57.370 --> 09:01.708
- How do you mean?
- I didn't realize how much I lean on you.

09:01.791 --> 09:07.255
The way you handled everything
after I was shot, it was masterful.

09:08.423 --> 09:12.177
Well, I... I guess
I kept my head above water.

09:12.260 --> 09:17.349
Claire told me how supportive you were,
what a natural leader you proved to be.

09:17.432 --> 09:20.602
I want that by my side, Donald,

09:20.685 --> 09:24.897
the same way that Meechum was,
as my running mate.

09:25.857 --> 09:27.900
You want me on the ticket?

09:27.984 --> 09:31.738
A heartbeat away from the presidency
is a serious matter now.

09:31.821 --> 09:34.031
Conway is a tough opponent.

09:35.408 --> 09:39.412
I never expected you'd want me.
I thought I was just a placeholder.

09:39.496 --> 09:43.166
No, we can win, Donald.
You and I, together.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.377
I don't know, Frank.

09:46.711 --> 09:51.258
You need someone who's hungry for this.
I'm not a great campaigner.

09:51.341 --> 09:54.802
- Vermont doesn't help you.
- You have a deep sense of duty,

09:54.886 --> 09:59.599
like all the men and women here
who served their country,

09:59.682 --> 10:02.560
and that's far more important
to me than strategy.

10:03.936 --> 10:05.230
[Blythe sighs]

10:06.939 --> 10:10.693
To be honest,
I don't know if I want it, Frank.

10:11.611 --> 10:15.823
When I had to take over,
the stress, the responsibility...

10:17.617 --> 10:20.745
Two weeks as president
was about as much as I can handle.

10:31.173 --> 10:32.590
[Frank sighs]

10:35.593 --> 10:37.053
I'm disappointed, Donald.

10:38.763 --> 10:40.182
But I understand.

10:40.682 --> 10:43.017
And I won't pressure you.

10:46.729 --> 10:48.648
Should we do this?

10:50.150 --> 10:51.651
[agent] Okay.

10:58.700 --> 11:01.369
[camera shutters clicking]

11:03.788 --> 11:06.583
[Blythe] Do you have
other folks in mind, if it isn't me?

11:06.666 --> 11:08.668
Well, we should probably
reach out to the leadership,

11:08.751 --> 11:10.795
and get their advice.

11:10.878 --> 11:12.129
But you're right.

11:13.047 --> 11:16.676
Whoever it is,
they need to be hungry for it.

11:17.844 --> 11:20.012
All of these deaths
could have been prevented.

11:20.096 --> 11:21.431
- [camera shutters clicking]
- And that's why

11:21.514 --> 11:24.141
I'm working with a coalition of senators
to introduce a law

11:24.226 --> 11:25.977
that will extend background checks

11:26.060 --> 11:30.565
to all gun transactions,
including gun shows and online sales.

11:30.648 --> 11:33.610
And let me be clear,
this is not an assault on gun ownership.

11:33.693 --> 11:36.404
It's an assault on illegal gun ownership.

11:37.905 --> 11:40.492
- I'll now take questions.
- [all clamoring]

11:40.575 --> 11:43.578
[Hannah] The next President
of the United States,

11:43.661 --> 11:47.081
the love of my life, the best father
a mother could hope for,

11:47.164 --> 11:50.627
- my husband, Will Conway.
- [all cheering]

11:53.421 --> 11:56.674
- [all clapping]
- [chanting] Conway! Conway! Conway!

12:00.052 --> 12:01.888
[all cheering loudly]

12:05.099 --> 12:06.100
Hello, New York!

12:06.183 --> 12:08.520
[LeAnn] <i>He's ahead by double digits</i>
<i>in every battleground state.</i>

12:08.603 --> 12:10.522
[Patricia] <i>The RNC is raising</i>
<i>two-to-one what we have.</i>

12:10.605 --> 12:13.275
<i>- This guy is a rock star.</i>
- [Womack] <i>We need our own rock star.</i>

12:13.358 --> 12:15.318
[Bob] Who are you thinking of,
Mr. President?

12:15.402 --> 12:16.611
Donald Blythe.

12:19.614 --> 12:23.200
Uh, don't you think
there's a more strategic choice?

12:23.285 --> 12:25.287
I am being strategic.

12:25.370 --> 12:27.830
Look, it's one thing
that Dunbar's dropped out,

12:27.914 --> 12:29.332
but we have to get her supporters.

12:29.416 --> 12:32.043
And Donald Blythe, he oozes integrity.

12:32.126 --> 12:35.505
He can help us get all of those
disillusioned people back into our camp.

12:35.588 --> 12:36.964
[Bob] What about moderates in the general?

12:37.048 --> 12:40.009
- We need somebody from a swing state.
- With deep fundraising pockets.

12:40.092 --> 12:42.429
[Frank] Well, look,
we can sell Donald's experience.

12:42.512 --> 12:45.723
He's filled the shoes. I see no reason
to change horses midstream.

12:45.807 --> 12:49.727
- He doesn't check off enough columns.
- [Bob] We want a fighter, not a professor.

12:49.811 --> 12:51.729
I agree, sir.
We can do better than Blythe.

12:53.105 --> 12:55.650
Well, I am hard-pressed
to come up with anyone better

12:55.733 --> 12:58.403
than a man who actually knows
what it's like to sit at that desk.

12:59.696 --> 13:01.614
We can offer you some names.

13:02.365 --> 13:04.283
- He'll be devastated.
- Let me talk to him.

13:04.367 --> 13:06.118
No, it's better that I do.
Let me talk to him.

13:06.202 --> 13:07.704
We'll get you that list right away.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.914
Well, all right. If you can come up
with some alternatives,

13:09.997 --> 13:12.334
I'm certainly willing to listen.
Thank you all very much.

13:12.417 --> 13:16.128
And I believe the best government
is that which governs least.

13:16.212 --> 13:17.714
[all cheering]

13:20.216 --> 13:23.428
That's not a new idea.
It's an old one.

13:23.511 --> 13:25.847
The founder of our party,
Jefferson, said it.

13:26.931 --> 13:29.016
We need to make it new again.

13:29.100 --> 13:32.729
We need a government that doesn't
interfere with people's lives,

13:32.812 --> 13:35.773
with their liberty,
with their pursuit of happiness.

13:35.857 --> 13:39.235
- [all cheering]
- Isn't that what we need to protect?

13:40.277 --> 13:46.534
Yes. And that's where President Underwood
is failing us the most.

13:46.618 --> 13:48.202
Doug, where are we on the, uh--

13:48.285 --> 13:50.455
FISA Court could take a while.
The judge was reluctant.

13:50.538 --> 13:54.291
- I should set up a meeting anyway.
- I've never liked this plan, sir.

13:54.376 --> 13:57.128
I don't think we should do anything
until we get the court ruling.

13:57.211 --> 13:59.589
Plan A is in motion,
let's let that pan out first.

13:59.672 --> 14:03.009
If plan A works, then fine,
Pollyhop is no longer a problem,

14:03.092 --> 14:05.011
but if it doesn't, I need to start
laying the groundwork.

14:05.094 --> 14:08.515
- Macallan could take some convincing.
- We don't know this man--

14:08.598 --> 14:11.684
Yeah, we don't absolutely need
to widen the circle right now.

14:11.768 --> 14:12.769
[LeAnn] We do, sir.

14:12.852 --> 14:15.312
Just to get this sort of surveillance
operational can take weeks.

14:15.397 --> 14:18.525
Yeah, but Doug is right.
We don't know him. He's a stranger to us.

14:19.150 --> 14:22.612
He is the top data scientist
in the country, maybe the world.

14:22.695 --> 14:25.365
- He was exploring behavior adoption and--
- Stop.

14:27.742 --> 14:31.413
We are talking
domestic surveillance, LeAnn.

14:31.496 --> 14:34.999
And the only theory
I'm interested in is risk versus votes.

14:35.082 --> 14:37.334
And he gets us the votes.

14:38.002 --> 14:41.297
Didn't you hear the leadership?
They said Conway is destroying us.

14:41.381 --> 14:44.384
Macallan reverses that,
he wins us the election.

14:45.301 --> 14:46.469
[sighs]

14:49.096 --> 14:51.516
"ICO occupies Kurdish stronghold."

14:52.809 --> 14:54.769
How many of you have heard of ICO?

14:55.853 --> 14:59.315
They're Muslim extremists
taking over oil fields in Syria.

15:00.232 --> 15:02.151
The media is barely covering them

15:02.234 --> 15:05.572
because the White House
is turning a blind eye.

15:05.655 --> 15:07.532
As the Governor of New York...

15:08.533 --> 15:10.993
I can't turn a blind eye to terrorism

15:11.077 --> 15:13.871
because it's been right here
on our doorstep.

15:14.789 --> 15:17.459
You know what I did
when 9/11 happened?

15:17.542 --> 15:21.003
I joined the Air Force
because I wanted to serve my country,

15:21.087 --> 15:22.505
just like my grandfather did

15:22.589 --> 15:25.382
when he boarded a transport ship
on this very dock

15:25.467 --> 15:28.553
and sailed to the Pacific
to fight the Japanese.

15:29.929 --> 15:31.598
When my children grow up...

15:33.641 --> 15:35.226
Charlie and Lily...

15:37.269 --> 15:41.190
I wanna be able to...
to look them in the eye...

15:42.442 --> 15:44.902
and tell them that I fought for you.

15:44.986 --> 15:47.238
I fought for your future.

15:49.156 --> 15:51.408
And to me, that future is clear.

15:52.577 --> 15:58.750
Less government, less taxes,
more freedom, protect that freedom!

15:58.833 --> 16:00.627
[all cheering]

16:01.961 --> 16:05.465
Thank you so much.
Thank you, thank you.

16:05.548 --> 16:07.008
Governor, can you comment

16:07.091 --> 16:09.552
on your relationship with
the search engine Pollyhop?

16:10.762 --> 16:13.515
Is it true Pollyhop is providing you
with voter data?

16:14.807 --> 16:17.894
- I want Grant here, right away.
- Uh, he's in California I think.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.729
He's got two Gulf Streams.
Have him pick one.

16:19.812 --> 16:22.982
Thank you so much, thank you.
Thank you, take care.

16:23.065 --> 16:25.943
[reporter on tablet] <i>Is it true</i>
<i>Pollyhop is providing you with voter data?</i>

16:26.027 --> 16:28.362
- The question was caught on camera.
- Did he answer it?

16:28.445 --> 16:32.158
No. It's getting a lot of traction online.
Should be all over the news by morning.

16:32.241 --> 16:34.869
Have Seth send me
all the stories and clips so far.

16:35.912 --> 16:37.872
I don't think I have to meet
LeAnn's guy now.

16:38.790 --> 16:39.999
- Plan A's gonna work.
- No, no, no.

16:40.082 --> 16:42.544
Meet with him.
Look, it doesn't commit us to anything.

16:42.627 --> 16:44.045
- Sir--
- Look, I don't wanna go down this route

16:44.128 --> 16:46.631
any more than you do,
but at least we'll have our bases covered.

16:47.549 --> 16:48.716
Yes, sir.

16:51.468 --> 16:52.762
[sighs]

16:54.471 --> 16:58.350
Imagine a duel.
Me and Conway.

16:59.268 --> 17:03.397
Now, Conway has a powerful gun,
a search engine.

17:03.480 --> 17:08.778
And it's powerful because with it,
he can tell what you think, what you want,

17:08.861 --> 17:11.531
where you are and who you are.

17:11.614 --> 17:13.907
He can turn all those searches into votes,

17:13.991 --> 17:17.078
and that's enough bullets
to kill my chances of winning.

17:18.746 --> 17:21.790
But I have an even bigger gun.
It's called the NSA.

17:21.874 --> 17:23.626
It's one of the perks of being president.

17:23.710 --> 17:27.128
That is, if the courts allow
my surveillance request.

17:28.673 --> 17:31.175
I imagine the men hanging on these walls

17:31.258 --> 17:33.886
wished they'd had a gun like that
available to them.

17:33.970 --> 17:37.932
Your phone, the phone of the person
sitting next to you,

17:38.015 --> 17:39.809
your neighbor's phone
and everyone you know

17:39.892 --> 17:42.770
and the 300 million Americans
you don't know.

17:43.771 --> 17:49.611
I can see you, and I can use
what I see to rig this election.

17:49.694 --> 17:53.656
Now, of course, a weapon like that,
well, you can imagine how risky it is.

17:53.740 --> 17:56.533
Huh, it might have even given pause
to an old crook like him.

17:56.618 --> 17:58.494
I mean, they roasted him on the spit

17:58.578 --> 18:00.872
for tapping into a few rooms
at the Watergate.

18:00.955 --> 18:04.876
I'm talking about tapping into
every single home in America.

18:04.959 --> 18:08.379
And a weapon like that
could blow up in my hand

18:08.462 --> 18:12.842
and that's why it's plan B.
Plan A is much safer.

18:12.925 --> 18:16.137
Expose that Conway
is using his gun illegally

18:16.220 --> 18:18.681
and remove the weapon from his hand.

18:24.854 --> 18:27.815
Hmm...
All three of us took bullets.

18:29.191 --> 18:31.778
Well, I know why we're smiling.
We survived.

19:15.029 --> 19:16.989
[sighs]

19:28.084 --> 19:30.712
[LeAnn sighing] Aidan.
This is Doug Stamper.

19:30.795 --> 19:32.922
[Aidan] Yeah, I know who he is.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.632
Tell me why I'm here.

19:35.717 --> 19:39.345
Domestic surveillance.
We need to win an election.

19:45.977 --> 19:49.814
- You serious?
- What if we were?

19:49.897 --> 19:53.234
The NSA... [scoffs]

19:55.737 --> 19:58.572
- You'd take that risk?
- [Doug] If you can be trusted.

19:58.655 --> 20:04.078
Every theory you have ever had,
everything you have ever wanted to test.

20:04.996 --> 20:09.375
And in return, you get what?
Voter data? So you know who to target?

20:09.458 --> 20:11.794
And how to target them, to influence them.

20:11.878 --> 20:13.462
To brainwash them?

20:15.882 --> 20:18.259
Oh, this is about Conway,
the Pollyhop thing.

20:18.342 --> 20:21.178
- I never should've told you that.
- Are we wasting our time?

20:22.638 --> 20:25.307
I couldn't put a single person on this.

20:25.391 --> 20:27.727
- No. It's radioactive.
- We're done.

20:27.810 --> 20:29.729
- This is over.
- How would this even work?

20:29.812 --> 20:31.522
To get backbone access requires--

20:31.605 --> 20:34.025
[LeAnn] We're getting a FISA ruling,
counter-terrorism.

20:34.108 --> 20:35.526
[Aidan] I've never won
a bid from the NSA--

20:35.609 --> 20:37.403
- LeAnn, let's go.
- [LeAnn] You'd win the bid.

20:37.486 --> 20:40.782
This is what you want, Aidan.

20:42.449 --> 20:43.785
Jesus.

20:50.875 --> 20:54.420
You came here to see if you can trust me.
How do I know I can trust you?

20:56.798 --> 20:59.550
I don't care whether you trust me or not.

20:59.633 --> 21:04.388
But if we go down this road,
you take the fall if anything goes wrong.

21:04.471 --> 21:07.558
Not us, not the president.
You.

21:07.641 --> 21:11.896
It's the only way this works.
So you tell me if you think it's worth it.

21:13.647 --> 21:15.149
The worth.

21:18.986 --> 21:21.322
You have no idea.

21:21.405 --> 21:23.991
Thank you so much for coming.

21:24.075 --> 21:25.993
- Jeffrey!
- Governor.

21:26.077 --> 21:28.204
How you doing?
Thank you so much.

21:28.287 --> 21:31.165
Buying a whole table.
I mean, you've just been so great to us.

21:31.248 --> 21:33.375
Anything for you, Governor.
Can I get a photo?

21:33.459 --> 21:34.626
Of course.

21:37.463 --> 21:38.672
How you doing, Rich?

21:38.755 --> 21:43.469
- Is this, uh, Pollyhop thing true?
- Let's get Hannah in this. Hannah.

21:46.388 --> 21:47.639
- Oh, Jeff.
- Hannah, good to see you.

21:47.723 --> 21:49.016
- Good to see you. How are you?
- Mr. Grant is here.

21:49.100 --> 21:50.184
I'm good, how are you?

21:50.267 --> 21:52.186
Jeffrey, I'm gonna come find you, okay?
I'll be right back.

21:52.269 --> 21:53.855
- Okay.
- Let's do it.

21:53.938 --> 21:55.982
I'm getting calls from <i>The New York Times.</i>

21:56.065 --> 21:58.192
There is no way
we can keep a lid on this now.

21:58.275 --> 21:59.443
We're getting calls from everyone.

21:59.526 --> 22:03.447
If the media really digs their feet in,
forget about the public response.

22:03.530 --> 22:05.032
We need to worry about
the Justice Department.

22:06.283 --> 22:07.952
You said
what we're doing wasn't illegal.

22:08.035 --> 22:10.204
[Marshall] No, I said it was gray,
that it's unregulated.

22:10.287 --> 22:12.414
[Benjamin] Our data is proprietary.

22:12.498 --> 22:14.166
How we want to use it,
it's our prerogative.

22:14.250 --> 22:17.336
If they put a value on the benefits
of sharing all that data,

22:17.419 --> 22:20.631
the figure would break
all campaign finance caps there are.

22:20.714 --> 22:22.133
How the fuck did this get out?

22:23.425 --> 22:25.677
Sir? That reporter's not
in our press pool.

22:25.761 --> 22:28.430
- We didn't credential him ourselves.
- So, who does he work for?

22:28.514 --> 22:30.141
We're still trying to track that down.

22:31.517 --> 22:32.768
Give me your phone.

22:36.438 --> 22:39.400
[woman] <i>I'll connect you now, sir.</i>
<i>You are now on with the president.</i>

22:39.483 --> 22:41.152
[Frank] <i>I must say, I'm disappointed.</i>

22:41.235 --> 22:44.071
<i>I was hoping the first time
we met would be in person.</i>

22:44.155 --> 22:46.823
- We've met before.
<i>- Oh, yes, that's right.</i>

22:46.908 --> 22:48.910
<i>You know why I'm calling, Mr. President.</i>

22:48.993 --> 22:51.913
No, but I have been reading
some curious articles.

22:51.996 --> 22:55.082
How long before you think
it becomes mainstream?

22:55.166 --> 22:56.833
<i>You planted that reporter.</i>

22:56.918 --> 23:00.504
I did not. You're giving me
far more credit than I deserve.

23:00.587 --> 23:03.174
If you bring
the Justice Department into this,

23:03.257 --> 23:05.426
I'll come down hard on you
for abuse of power,

23:05.509 --> 23:07.970
and that'll hurt you
just as much as it hurts me.

23:08.054 --> 23:11.223
<i>I won't have to. They read the newspapers,
just like everyone else.</i>

23:12.141 --> 23:13.767
Well, then you better hold them back.

23:13.850 --> 23:17.646
<i>Let me remind you, Governor,
in case you do become president one day,</i>

23:17.729 --> 23:19.856
the Justice Department is autonomous.

23:19.941 --> 23:21.943
If I were to intervene,
it would be illegal.

23:22.026 --> 23:24.111
<i>Just like when you raided FEMA?</i>

23:24.195 --> 23:26.613
<i>See, the country wants to believe
that you're corrupt,</i>

23:26.697 --> 23:28.950
<i>and I'll draw a very clear line
between you--</i>

23:29.033 --> 23:31.243
Go ahead.
The more volume on this, the better.

23:31.327 --> 23:35.081
You hurl accusations,
I'll let the press hurl facts.

23:35.998 --> 23:40.169
<i>But what did you really hope to achieve?
I think you've wasted your time.</i>

23:40.252 --> 23:43.005
<i>You should have called me
when you had some actual leverage.</i>

23:43.089 --> 23:45.924
<i>But I must say,
it is a treat to hear you so worked up.</i>

23:46.008 --> 23:47.384
<i>I do thank you for that.</i>

23:47.468 --> 23:50.721
"Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln.

23:50.804 --> 23:54.141
<i>Tall men make good presidents."
You said that when we first met.</i>

23:54.225 --> 23:56.268
Yes, I remember what I said.

23:57.603 --> 23:59.146
<i>You were intimidated.</i>

23:59.230 --> 24:03.025
I don't underestimate you, Governor.
But intimidated?

24:03.109 --> 24:07.238
<i>Takes a lot more than height and arrogance
to intimidate me.</i>

24:07.321 --> 24:09.115
<i>You better get back to all your lawyers.</i>

24:09.198 --> 24:10.282
[line disconnects]

24:13.202 --> 24:14.745
[pumping blood pressure cuff]

24:14.828 --> 24:18.415
When the Roman general Sulla,
who was about the same age I am now,

24:18.499 --> 24:21.585
marched on Rome
to purge the city of usurpers,

24:21.668 --> 24:23.254
it was a bloodbath.

24:23.337 --> 24:26.173
His greatest rival
was a young man named Marius,

24:26.257 --> 24:28.300
who was just 26 years old.

24:28.384 --> 24:29.968
And after Sulla had him killed,

24:30.052 --> 24:34.515
he held up his head in the forum
and looked into the boy's dead eyes

24:34.598 --> 24:37.601
and said,
"First, you must learn to pull an oar.

24:37.684 --> 24:40.229
Only then can you take the helm."

24:40.312 --> 24:42.064
[air hissing]

24:44.150 --> 24:48.529
Hmm. 110 over 80.
Not bad.

24:50.322 --> 24:51.657
- Will.
- Hey.

24:54.451 --> 24:55.827
[sighing]

24:55.911 --> 24:57.204
Hey.

24:57.288 --> 25:01.250
[sighs] I called the president.

25:02.834 --> 25:04.503
It was a mistake.

25:05.462 --> 25:06.880
- Okay.
- Mmm.

25:09.007 --> 25:14.638
Look, um...
why don't we go back upstairs

25:14.721 --> 25:16.390
- and collect some money?
- [Will chuckling]

25:16.473 --> 25:19.810
Okay?
Everyone wants to see you.

25:26.483 --> 25:28.777
[breathing deeply]

25:28.860 --> 25:31.072
- Let's go.
- You'll figure it out.

25:42.541 --> 25:46.128
Conway called.
He wanted to make a deal.

25:47.171 --> 25:48.964
I'm sure that was enjoyable.

25:49.047 --> 25:52.093
It will be even more so once
the Justice Department gets involved.

25:55.304 --> 25:56.638
Is that the, uh...

25:57.556 --> 25:59.641
Same model.
Not the actual one.

26:06.357 --> 26:10.068
- Surprised the Secret Service let--
- Well, they removed the firing pin.

26:10.986 --> 26:12.613
[Frank] It's lighter than I imagined.

26:13.780 --> 26:17.243
It's amazing something this small
could do that much damage.

26:19.911 --> 26:23.707
I was gonna bring it tomorrow,
but I think it might be too theatrical.

26:30.464 --> 26:31.840
[sniffs]

26:34.050 --> 26:37.346
You want me to help you practice?

26:39.390 --> 26:40.724
All right.

26:44.353 --> 26:45.937
Good morning, Mrs. Underwood.

26:46.855 --> 26:48.357
Good morning, Ms. Melman.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.901
- No, what's her first name?
- Julia.

26:50.984 --> 26:53.570
- Use that.
- We've never met before.

26:53.654 --> 26:56.114
Remind her who the First Lady is.

26:59.910 --> 27:01.162
Good morning, Julia.

27:02.078 --> 27:04.122
Good morning, Mrs. Underwood.

27:04.206 --> 27:05.624
Please, have a seat.

27:09.461 --> 27:13.924
We want to be inclusive.
We'd like the NRA to work with us

27:14.007 --> 27:15.467
on getting this bill passed.

27:15.551 --> 27:18.554
We have major support
on both sides of the aisle.

27:18.637 --> 27:21.056
Well, you do for now,
but not for long.

27:21.139 --> 27:23.850
You can have 20 kids massacred
in a school shooting.

27:23.934 --> 27:26.895
There's always the usual public outcry,
demands for gun reform.

27:26.978 --> 27:29.398
[Frank] But a few months go by
and people forget.

27:29.481 --> 27:31.192
Well, this will move
through Congress quickly.

27:31.275 --> 27:33.985
We've got major support
on both sides of the aisle.

27:34.069 --> 27:35.696
Not enough to break a filibuster.

27:35.779 --> 27:37.989
[Frank] <i>We'll drag this out</i>
<i>till the election.</i>

27:38.073 --> 27:40.116
We'll tie up every other bill
in the Senate.

27:40.201 --> 27:41.827
Well, I've spoken
to a lot of Senators and they--

27:41.910 --> 27:44.496
[Frank] No, don't get bogged down there.
Pivot right to the Supreme Court.

27:44.580 --> 27:47.541
You plan on holding up
the Supreme Court nomination, as well?

27:47.624 --> 27:49.751
Unless you're going to nominate
an NRA member.

27:49.835 --> 27:52.629
- You know we can't do that.
- Jacobs was unpredictable.

27:52.713 --> 27:54.506
This time we're not taking any chances.

27:54.590 --> 27:56.425
[Claire] If you bring the government
to a standstill,

27:56.508 --> 27:58.594
we're gonna make this election
about the NRA.

27:58.677 --> 28:01.305
You can't match $100 million in ad buys.

28:01.388 --> 28:03.349
[Julia] Go for it.
Flush your money down the drain.

28:03.432 --> 28:06.393
The Democrats lost that battle
decades ago.

28:06.477 --> 28:07.519
<i>And you'll lose it again.</i>

28:07.603 --> 28:11.982
The president never offered up
one gun reform bill while he was whip.

28:12.065 --> 28:13.692
Well, because it wasn't
a top priority for him--

28:13.775 --> 28:15.777
No, no, no, no, no.
Make it, uh, stronger.

28:15.861 --> 28:19.448
Say, uh, "The president took a bullet!"
Make it personal.

28:19.531 --> 28:22.576
I'm sorry your husband got shot.
But not enough to roll over.

28:22.659 --> 28:24.870
[Claire] Oh, we're not asking you to.

28:24.953 --> 28:27.873
We're inviting you
to be on the right side of history.

28:27.956 --> 28:30.709
Yeah, that's good,
but you wanna go in for the kill.

28:30.792 --> 28:33.086
We want this woman
storming out of that door,

28:33.169 --> 28:34.338
foaming at the mouth.

28:34.421 --> 28:36.590
All right.
Don't disgrace yourself, Julia.

28:36.673 --> 28:38.467
- Think about the future--
- [Frank] No, tougher.

28:38.550 --> 28:39.926
Stronger, tougher!

28:42.679 --> 28:43.722
All right, what about...

28:43.805 --> 28:46.933
Thirty years from now
when you're dying in hospice care...

28:47.559 --> 28:50.854
you can look back
and be proud of all the lives you saved.

28:50.937 --> 28:53.857
Or you can be forgotten...

28:53.940 --> 28:56.693
clutching onto the past
with your cold, dead hands.

28:57.486 --> 28:58.612
I'll show myself out.

28:58.695 --> 29:02.366
That's exactly the steel goddamn stomach
I was talking about.

29:02.449 --> 29:03.867
Was it Pete Dreyer?

29:03.950 --> 29:06.745
[Conway] <i>Congressman Dreyer's</i>
<i>been a mentor for years.</i>

29:06.828 --> 29:09.998
- He had no right to tell you.
- He had every right.

29:10.081 --> 29:11.708
If a member
of the House Intelligence Committee

29:11.792 --> 29:15.211
chooses to share information with me,
he's at liberty to do so.

29:15.296 --> 29:16.838
[Brockhart] <i>Our conversation</i>
<i>was in confidence.</i>

29:16.922 --> 29:18.507
<i>I don't feel comfortable with this.</i>

29:18.590 --> 29:20.926
The Congressman
is just as frustrated as you are,

29:21.009 --> 29:23.554
and he spoke to me
because he wants to help.

29:23.637 --> 29:25.264
And so do I, General.

29:25.347 --> 29:27.891
<i>Governor, I'm a soldier.
I'm not going to play politics.</i>

29:28.850 --> 29:32.813
You played politics the moment
you opened your mouth to Pete.

29:35.732 --> 29:39.320
<i>- Did you see my speech yesterday?</i>
- Yes, I did.

29:39.403 --> 29:41.071
<i>I meant every word of it.</i>

29:41.154 --> 29:43.532
<i>Now, you and I have
both fought for our country.</i>

29:43.615 --> 29:45.158
Underwood hasn't.

29:46.076 --> 29:48.412
He has no idea.
He doesn't understand.

29:49.621 --> 29:54.501
And that's why I need to be president,
so we can strike when we need to strike.

29:54.585 --> 29:58.422
<i>Look, I can help you,
but I need your help to do so.</i>

29:59.340 --> 30:03.760
I've never leaked classified information
to the press. Not once.

30:03.844 --> 30:06.513
My colleagues have. I haven't.

30:06.597 --> 30:08.181
[Conway] <i>There's a better way.</i>

30:08.264 --> 30:10.183
<i>You're not gonna like
the sound of this at first,</i>

30:10.266 --> 30:14.270
<i>but if you hear me out,
we can fight back on this.</i>

30:14.355 --> 30:15.939
- General.
- Mr. President.

30:18.650 --> 30:20.026
[door closes]

30:20.110 --> 30:23.530
You can take this back.
I am not accepting your resignation.

30:23.614 --> 30:24.865
Please, sit.

30:26.241 --> 30:28.327
I fought in Lebanon, sir.

30:28.410 --> 30:32.706
Commanded troops in Somalia, in Bosnia,
in both Gulf Wars, in Afghanistan.

30:32.789 --> 30:35.876
I just don't wanna see us bogged down
in another conflict like those.

30:35.959 --> 30:39.087
ICO is the next Al Qaeda and Taliban.

30:39.170 --> 30:42.466
And you accomplish nothing
by resigning your commission.

30:42.549 --> 30:45.761
We've accomplished nothing
with your current policy.

30:45.844 --> 30:49.014
[inhaling sharply] You know,
I just can't help but think that...

30:49.097 --> 30:53.018
the timing of this,
it's just a bit coincidental.

30:53.101 --> 30:56.438
- Sir?
- Well, Conway gave a big speech yesterday.

30:56.522 --> 30:59.315
I mean, he made a big meal out of ICO,
didn't he?

30:59.400 --> 31:02.444
I suppose he realizes
just how dangerous they are.

31:02.528 --> 31:05.656
Hmm. I wonder where
he's getting that information.

31:05.739 --> 31:07.323
I've no idea, sir.

31:07.408 --> 31:11.036
I've never spoken to the man, nor would I.
It's classified.

31:11.119 --> 31:13.497
And you're speaking from your conscience.

31:15.290 --> 31:16.625
Yes, sir.

31:17.459 --> 31:19.420
Conscience has
an unmistakable stink to it,

31:19.503 --> 31:22.130
sort of like raw onions
and morning breath.

31:22.213 --> 31:24.508
But a lie stinks even more

31:24.591 --> 31:26.760
when it's coming from someone
who isn't used to lying.

31:26.843 --> 31:29.846
It's more like rotten eggs and horseshit.

31:33.434 --> 31:36.770
- How soon can we move on this?
- You want to conduct the mission?

31:36.853 --> 31:38.480
Would it keep you from resigning?

31:39.481 --> 31:40.524
Well, I--

31:40.607 --> 31:45.195
I need your expertise and your experience,
and if both are telling me I'm wrong,

31:45.278 --> 31:47.656
I'd rather trust your instincts than mine.

31:48.490 --> 31:50.200
Do we still have an open window?

31:52.536 --> 31:54.496
The gathering is set to end
by tomorrow night.

31:54.580 --> 31:56.582
Let me talk to the Chairman
and the Secretary of Defense

31:56.665 --> 31:59.292
- before I sign off on the order.
- Of course, sir.

32:01.127 --> 32:04.548
General, it takes a brave man
to stand up to a president.

32:05.424 --> 32:07.759
If you authorize the mission,
we won't get our court ruling.

32:07.843 --> 32:11.638
There is no way to justify domestic
surveillance once ICO is eliminated.

32:11.722 --> 32:14.433
Which is fine,
because media pressure is mounting.

32:14.516 --> 32:16.893
Conway has no choice
but to distance himself from Pollyhop.

32:16.977 --> 32:19.145
We don't know how that's gonna play out.

32:19.229 --> 32:22.065
Oh, I can tell you how Brockhart's
resignation is gonna play out.

32:22.148 --> 32:24.735
Thirty-second ads in every swing state.

32:24.818 --> 32:28.489
A decorated war veteran pulverizing us
for being weak on national security.

32:28.572 --> 32:31.700
Pollyhop is gonna pulverize us more
than Brockhart ever could.

32:31.783 --> 32:33.910
Not if Conway is busy
fighting public outcry.

32:33.994 --> 32:35.912
Think about the data
they have already gathered.

32:35.996 --> 32:38.874
When you sold us this,
you said it was going to be a last resort,

32:38.957 --> 32:40.083
not the only resort.

32:40.166 --> 32:42.043
There is no risk
in getting surveillance approved.

32:42.127 --> 32:43.754
Then we either use it or we don't.

32:43.837 --> 32:46.632
But if you order this strike, sir,
we don't even have the option.

32:47.549 --> 32:50.385
- You've met with him, Macallan.
- Yes, sir.

32:50.469 --> 32:52.929
- So, can he be trusted?
- I honestly can't say.

32:53.013 --> 32:55.682
[LeAnn] He understands the risks
even better than you do.

32:58.977 --> 33:01.563
- I'm gonna authorize the strike.
- [LeAnn] Sir...

33:01.647 --> 33:04.691
- Your guy's an unknown. Brockhart isn't.
- [LeAnn] Ma'am...

33:05.316 --> 33:08.278
- I agree with Francis.
- [Frank] Get me the Secretary of Defense.

33:08.361 --> 33:10.572
[sighs]

33:10.656 --> 33:12.323
I've asked Claire to join us today

33:12.407 --> 33:14.409
because this directly affects
the legislation

33:14.493 --> 33:15.952
she's trying to get passed.

33:16.036 --> 33:19.706
Your top three choices for running mate,
they're all tight with the gun lobby.

33:19.790 --> 33:20.957
[clears throat] Mrs. Underwood...

33:21.041 --> 33:24.503
You know everyone in this room
agrees with the reforms you want,

33:24.586 --> 33:26.713
but we're thinking about
the general election,

33:26.797 --> 33:30.216
and the NRA is a terrible enemy
for us to make.

33:30.300 --> 33:33.554
Yeah, now Whittaker's gonna focus
on swing states, fundraising...

33:33.637 --> 33:35.221
That's where I'll play the bad cop.

33:35.305 --> 33:38.642
You play the worse cop.
Then when we get them off balance...

33:38.725 --> 33:41.061
You come back in again as the good cop.

33:41.144 --> 33:43.438
Exactly.
So I will start with...

33:43.522 --> 33:46.650
Well, I feel that these choices
send mixed messages.

33:46.733 --> 33:48.527
We're for gun reform, they're not.

33:48.610 --> 33:53.156
If both names on the ticket
are gun-control fanatics,

33:53.239 --> 33:55.033
then the whole election becomes about...

33:55.116 --> 33:57.327
Get personal,
the way you told me to with Melman.

33:57.410 --> 33:59.663
One out of four presidents gets shot at.

33:59.746 --> 34:02.457
One out of every ten
dies from a bullet wound.

34:02.541 --> 34:04.084
Better than that.

34:04.167 --> 34:07.087
I saw Edward Meechum die
before my very eyes.

34:07.170 --> 34:09.755
- Good. You were lucky.
- I'm lucky.

34:09.840 --> 34:12.300
[Patricia] Statistics don't mean
anything to these people.

34:12.382 --> 34:15.178
They see this as a one-way road
to confiscation.

34:15.261 --> 34:17.388
I lose my seat in a heartbeat
if I take this stance.

34:17.472 --> 34:21.601
- Now, this is where I will play good cop.
- Okay, so Birch goes,

34:21.685 --> 34:25.521
"We're asking you to look at the bigger
picture here, Mr. President."

34:25.606 --> 34:27.065
You're right, Bob.

34:27.148 --> 34:29.943
- Claire!
- They're all right. They are.

34:30.025 --> 34:32.904
My meeting with the NRA did not go well.

34:32.987 --> 34:34.280
They're going to fight this
tooth and nail.

34:34.364 --> 34:35.616
[Bob] Well, of course they are.

34:35.699 --> 34:38.619
And... and the chances are
the legislation won't pass.

34:38.702 --> 34:40.954
[Claire] Oh, it'll pass.
Because you are going to push it

34:41.036 --> 34:43.915
until it goes through both houses
and gets on the books.

34:43.998 --> 34:45.208
We may have support now...

34:45.291 --> 34:48.128
But by the time
this bill gets onto the floor...

34:49.045 --> 34:51.422
You focus on the language, Congressman.

34:51.505 --> 34:54.009
Leave convincing
the American people to us.

34:54.092 --> 34:55.969
Now, if you wanna
work with us on this bill,

34:56.052 --> 34:59.014
I can stomach a gun-friendly candidate.

34:59.097 --> 35:00.515
What about you, Francis?

35:01.683 --> 35:03.101
The kill.

35:03.184 --> 35:06.813
Only on one condition, Claire.
I don't want us to work our asses off

35:06.897 --> 35:10.358
getting this bill passed just to see it
knocked down in the courts.

35:10.441 --> 35:13.737
- We don't have any control over that, sir.
- We still need to fill Jacobs' seat.

35:13.820 --> 35:18.784
If you can confirm an anti-gun justice,
I'll put a gun-lover on the ticket.

35:18.867 --> 35:22.788
A Supreme Court confirmation
in the middle of an election?

35:22.871 --> 35:24.080
Oh, come on, grow a pair, Bob.

35:24.164 --> 35:26.041
We're giving you what you want.
Give us what we want.

35:26.124 --> 35:27.583
[sighs]

35:28.919 --> 35:30.420
Who are you thinking about?

35:33.256 --> 35:34.758
[Janine] Nobody followed you?

35:35.967 --> 35:37.886
[Tom] No one.
I'm positive.

35:40.180 --> 35:44.350
[Janine] You know, sometimes
I have a student and something seems off.

35:44.434 --> 35:48.021
They look a little too old, you know?
To be in college.

35:53.777 --> 35:55.946
- [Tom] What is that?
- Xanax.

35:59.700 --> 36:03.078
[breathing deeply]

36:06.039 --> 36:07.582
Lucas came up here.

36:09.334 --> 36:10.585
To the campus.

36:14.005 --> 36:16.091
He wanted my help and I said no.

36:19.427 --> 36:21.763
Maybe if I had, he wouldn't have...

36:21.847 --> 36:23.807
[sighing heavily]

36:25.016 --> 36:26.517
So stupid.

36:28.436 --> 36:29.771
He got out.

36:31.857 --> 36:33.274
Why did he do this?

36:34.567 --> 36:38.029
- [Tom] That's what I'm trying to find out.
- [sighs]

36:43.952 --> 36:45.411
[sighs]

36:45.495 --> 36:47.038
It's all true, Tom.

36:47.122 --> 36:49.750
- How do you know?
- Because I know.

36:52.377 --> 36:55.714
Lucas didn't mention you
in his suicide letter.

36:55.797 --> 36:57.758
I'm sure it was to protect me.

37:00.676 --> 37:03.179
If you have any proof,
now's the time to share it.

37:03.263 --> 37:06.099
If I did, do you think
any of this would've happened?

37:10.353 --> 37:13.439
- You could go on record--
- I signed an affidavit.

37:13.523 --> 37:16.526
Anything I say now is worth shit.

37:18.820 --> 37:20.947
That's probably why they've left me alone.

37:21.031 --> 37:22.532
[Janine shudders]

37:26.577 --> 37:29.622
No, no. No.
No more pills.

37:30.874 --> 37:33.459
- Promise me you'll be careful.
- I promise.

37:34.419 --> 37:35.962
I would help if I could, I--

37:36.046 --> 37:38.965
You just focus on taking care of yourself.

37:40.675 --> 37:42.218
[sniffling]

37:46.514 --> 37:48.266
Come here. Come here.

37:48.349 --> 37:50.435
[sniffling]

37:52.728 --> 37:55.440
[Conway] Is there anything I can do
to make you reconsider?

37:56.399 --> 37:59.986
Yes, sir, I understand.
I'm pleased the strike's on, as well.

38:00.070 --> 38:02.197
Thank you for the heads up.
Bye.

38:03.114 --> 38:04.532
Fuck!

38:04.615 --> 38:06.827
- [Hannah] What's wrong?
- He caved.

38:06.910 --> 38:08.744
- [sighs] The general?
- Yes.

38:08.829 --> 38:10.663
Daddy, when is it?

38:11.664 --> 38:14.000
[Conway] When is it?
[grunts] Ben?

38:14.709 --> 38:17.337
I'm not sure about this, Will.
Maybe we should cancel it.

38:17.420 --> 38:19.047
My lawyers are saying
it's a terrible idea.

38:19.130 --> 38:21.132
If it's not us,
it's the Justice Department.

38:21.216 --> 38:24.928
- I've put everything into this company.
- Just trust me on this.

38:25.011 --> 38:26.972
- Hey, Will.
- Mmm-hmm?

38:27.055 --> 38:28.473
- For my Insta.
- Yeah.

38:28.556 --> 38:30.266
Okay.
Smile, Charlie.

38:30.809 --> 38:32.102
Smile.

38:32.727 --> 38:34.395
- [Conway chuckles] All right.
- Great.

38:34.479 --> 38:36.314
[Conway] Here we go.

38:36.397 --> 38:39.400
- You little...
- [Charlie giggling]

38:40.568 --> 38:42.737
- Scoot over.
- [laughing]

38:42.821 --> 38:43.864
Are we all set?

38:43.947 --> 38:47.200
Yes, sir.
Ready whenever you are.

38:47.283 --> 38:49.119
[Hannah] Here we go.

38:51.746 --> 38:53.248
[cell phone chimes]

38:53.331 --> 38:55.333
Okay.

38:55.416 --> 38:56.709
[Conway gruffly]
You ready? You ready?

38:56.792 --> 38:58.503
- [Charlie] Yep.
- [both chuckling]

39:00.088 --> 39:01.297
[Hannah] Here we go.

39:01.923 --> 39:05.718
Hello, America. I'm Will Conway,
Republican candidate for president,

39:05.801 --> 39:09.764
and this is my son, Charlie.
You wanna say hi to everyone, Charlie?

39:09.848 --> 39:12.308
- A little hi. Can we get a little hi?
- [Hannah laughing]

39:12.392 --> 39:14.185
No? That's all we get?
That's all we get.

39:14.269 --> 39:19.565
And this is Hannah, my wife.
And our little rascal Lily.

39:19.649 --> 39:22.402
[laughing]
Well, she's not so little anymore,

39:22.485 --> 39:24.529
but definitely still a rascal.

39:24.612 --> 39:26.031
- [Conway chuckles]
- Aren't you, sweetheart?

39:26.114 --> 39:29.910
And we are webcasting
from our home here in Albany.

39:29.993 --> 39:33.454
As you can see, we don't live
in the governor's mansion.

39:33.538 --> 39:36.374
We live in a regular house,
just like many of you.

39:36.457 --> 39:41.462
And this is our living room.
Hannah has decorated everything herself.

39:41.546 --> 39:43.924
- [both chuckling]
- Well, except for the toys.

39:44.007 --> 39:46.301
That's the...
That's the kids' addition to the decor.

39:46.384 --> 39:48.428
A lot of toys.

39:48.511 --> 39:52.140
Now, many of you have seen
or read in the news

39:52.223 --> 39:56.769
rumors about my campaign teaming up
with the search engine Pollyhop,

39:56.852 --> 39:59.189
and I'd like to speak to you today
about those rumors

39:59.272 --> 40:01.232
because they're not rumors at all.

40:01.316 --> 40:04.152
They're facts.
One hundred percent accurate.

40:04.235 --> 40:08.198
And here is my good friend Benjamin Grant.
He's the founder of Pollyhop,

40:08.281 --> 40:10.951
and he's gonna tell you
about our partnership.

40:11.034 --> 40:14.454
Well, a lot of big companies
stay out of politics.

40:14.537 --> 40:18.041
They don't want to offend anyone.
But not Pollyhop.

40:18.124 --> 40:22.295
We're not shy about who we support,
and we're proud to support Will Conway.

40:22.378 --> 40:25.340
He knows what this country needs
and where it's going.

40:27.092 --> 40:29.719
Now...

40:29.802 --> 40:33.431
I realize this might scare
a lot of people.

40:34.349 --> 40:38.269
Do we know your personal information?
Can we see what you're searching for?

40:38.353 --> 40:40.730
Are we reading your emails?

40:40.813 --> 40:44.900
The answer is no.
We're not tracking individuals.

40:44.985 --> 40:46.527
We're looking at metadata,

40:46.611 --> 40:51.574
large-scale browsing patterns,
search trends, regional portraits.

40:51.657 --> 40:53.868
'Cause Ben is right.

40:53.952 --> 40:57.247
A president should know his constituents.

40:57.330 --> 40:59.915
And the Internet
is the best tool for that.

41:00.000 --> 41:04.087
Now, I've met thousands of people
and shaken a lot of hands,

41:04.170 --> 41:06.881
but I can't meet everyone.

41:06.965 --> 41:10.926
So this is my way of listening
to millions of you.

41:11.011 --> 41:15.015
Now, it's only fair
if I get to know you better,

41:15.098 --> 41:16.724
you should get to know me better.

41:16.807 --> 41:20.811
So while I'm not reading
your personal correspondence,

41:20.895 --> 41:22.855
I want you to have access to mine.

41:22.938 --> 41:27.818
So, from this point forward, every email,
text message, photo, or video

41:27.902 --> 41:29.487
that I use on this phone,

41:29.570 --> 41:32.782
you can see it all, including everything
since I became governor.

41:34.659 --> 41:38.997
Now, all you have to do
is go into my campaign website at...

41:39.080 --> 41:41.707
Conway2016.com.

41:41.791 --> 41:45.170
That's correct.
And you'll find a link right there.

41:45.253 --> 41:48.089
Our life is your life.

41:48.173 --> 41:51.384
And your future is our future.

41:51.467 --> 41:54.845
Thank you, and God bless America.

41:56.639 --> 41:58.099
[Conway exhaling]

41:58.183 --> 42:00.851
- That was good.
- Yeah, that was good.

42:00.935 --> 42:03.146
Well done. Well done.

42:03.229 --> 42:04.480
- You got it, Governor.
- [Hannah sighing]

42:04.564 --> 42:06.941
All right. Now we wait and see.

42:07.025 --> 42:09.360
His honesty and openness
have made quite an impact,

42:09.444 --> 42:10.986
and America is paying attention.

42:11.071 --> 42:13.489
Just three hours since Conway's webcast,

42:13.573 --> 42:16.034
over two million people
have visited his website...

42:16.117 --> 42:20.246
The massive public interest
has driven traffic to Pollyhop.com.

42:20.330 --> 42:25.501
Pollyhop CEO Benjamin Grant is reporting
three times its normal volume of searches.

42:25.585 --> 42:28.338
All of the cell phone footage
is on the Conway campaign website.

42:28.421 --> 42:30.005
There's a ton of archived clips.

42:30.090 --> 42:33.051
Some have already gone viral,
including this one,

42:33.134 --> 42:37.638
filmed just this morning, of Conway
with his gorgeous wife Hannah, so jealous,

42:37.722 --> 42:39.849
and his totally adorable son Charlie.

42:39.932 --> 42:41.267
- [Conway grunting]
- [Charlie laughing]

42:41.351 --> 42:42.685
[Conway] Whee!

42:45.230 --> 42:48.149
- Shave Mom's head, not mine!
- Shave Mom's head?

42:48.233 --> 42:49.400
- Okay.
- [Hannah squealing] No!

42:49.484 --> 42:52.112
You guessed it.
I still hate children.

42:57.617 --> 43:00.786
People don't care about their privacy.
They want him to have access.

43:00.870 --> 43:03.038
He's still breaking
campaign finance regulations.

43:03.123 --> 43:06.251
But he's getting good press,
not the public outcry we had hoped for.

43:06.334 --> 43:08.253
You can't let
the Justice Department investigate.

43:08.336 --> 43:09.795
It'll backfire on us.

43:09.879 --> 43:12.006
What you need to do
is call off the air strike.

43:12.090 --> 43:14.717
Sir, you've already signed the order.
We've got planes in the air.

43:14.800 --> 43:16.844
My job is to win a campaign,
I need to have--

43:16.927 --> 43:19.639
- And my job is to protect the president.
- Enough!

43:24.477 --> 43:25.978
Jesus Christ.

43:29.149 --> 43:31.359
Go. I need to speak with him.

43:41.869 --> 43:43.496
[Claire] What are you thinking?

43:44.580 --> 43:47.167
That I was fine with this
when it was just plan B,

43:47.250 --> 43:50.253
but this is...
domestic surveillance.

43:50.336 --> 43:52.422
I mean, we don't even know this guy.

43:52.505 --> 43:56.717
[Claire] You're right, we don't know him.
What we do know...

43:57.385 --> 43:59.887
is we'll lose if we do nothing.

44:03.057 --> 44:05.726
They're beautiful, aren't they?
The Conways.

44:07.353 --> 44:10.815
- Their youth, their two little children.
- [Frank sighs]

44:10.898 --> 44:13.234
The country is falling in love with them.

44:16.362 --> 44:20.783
They won't fall in love with us like that,
but we have something they don't.

44:23.203 --> 44:27.373
We are willing to go one step farther
than everyone else.

44:35.047 --> 44:36.632
General, a word.

44:38.718 --> 44:40.261
[Brockhart] We're approximately
two hours out--

44:40.345 --> 44:41.804
- Abort the mission.
- Mr. President?

44:41.887 --> 44:44.265
- I'm ordering you to abort.
- But you said--

44:44.349 --> 44:47.310
Don't make me say it a third time,
and don't threaten to resign,

44:47.393 --> 44:48.644
because I know you won't,

44:48.728 --> 44:51.981
because you can't even fathom
what it means to be a civilian.

44:52.064 --> 44:54.191
- Execute my order.
- Yes, sir.

44:55.735 --> 44:56.986
- [Doug] Sir.
- It's done.

44:57.069 --> 44:58.696
- Sir.
- I aborted.

45:26.724 --> 45:28.476
[cell phone chiming]

45:35.358 --> 45:36.401
You're up late.

45:36.484 --> 45:40.696
[Claire] <i>Go to Conway's website.</i>
<i>December 31st, 2012.</i>

45:47.161 --> 45:49.664
[Conway] <i>Hannah's last moments of 2012.</i>

45:49.747 --> 45:52.333
<i>- Oh.</i> [laughing]
- [Conway chuckling]

45:52.417 --> 45:54.209
<i>Stop, I'm stuffing my face.</i>

45:54.294 --> 45:57.297
[Conway] <i>You're feeding a growing girl.</i>
<i>Hello, little baby.</i>

45:57.380 --> 46:00.090
[Hannah] <i>Mmm.</i>
<i>Yes, I am.</i>

46:00.174 --> 46:02.593
<i>She's kicking like a maniac, too.
Will, please, stop.</i>

46:02.677 --> 46:03.719
<i>- No, come on.
- No.</i>

46:03.803 --> 46:05.638
<i>You've got... You have...
You have a little something...</i>

46:05.721 --> 46:07.348
[Frank] <i>Mr. Governor-elect.</i>

46:09.016 --> 46:10.810
Congressman, such an honor to meet you.

46:10.893 --> 46:13.228
- Well, the honor is mine.
- This is my wife, Hannah.

46:13.313 --> 46:15.022
It's a pleasure.
And this is Claire.

46:15.105 --> 46:16.231
Hello.

46:16.316 --> 46:18.776
- Oh, wow. How far along are you?
- Almost seven months.

46:18.859 --> 46:22.947
Thank you so much for inviting us here.
This is a real treat for us.

46:23.030 --> 46:25.783
Well, I'm glad you came. I thought
you'd be in Times Square tonight.

46:25.866 --> 46:28.202
It's Governor De Luca's
last year in office.

46:28.285 --> 46:30.079
I thought he should have
the spotlight to himself.

46:30.162 --> 46:31.539
Well, that's very classy of you.

46:31.622 --> 46:34.500
And I didn't wanna miss the chance
to make some new friends in Washington.

46:34.584 --> 46:37.670
Well, that was a smart idea.
Have you met Garrett, yet?

46:37.753 --> 46:38.796
No. No, sir.

46:38.879 --> 46:41.048
Well, come on.
Ladies, we'll be back.

46:49.014 --> 46:53.102
Mr. President-elect,
Governor-elect Conway.

46:53.185 --> 46:55.355
- Congratulations.
- You, too, sir.

46:55.438 --> 46:58.899
So here he is, the boy wonder.
He isn't a myth after all.

46:58.983 --> 47:00.818
- [Frank chuckling]
- More like a pariah.

47:00.901 --> 47:04.780
- There's a lot of Democrats here.
- [chuckling] Plenty of Republicans, too.

47:04.864 --> 47:06.073
Frank made sure of that.

47:06.156 --> 47:08.409
Well, if you wanna push the sludge
through Congress,

47:08.493 --> 47:10.620
it's best to have grease
on both sides of the aisle.

47:10.703 --> 47:12.538
- [Conway chuckles]
- [whispering indistinctly]

47:12.622 --> 47:14.749
Oh, I'm sorry, I have to go.
It's almost time.

47:15.416 --> 47:17.710
- Thank you for your service.
- [Conway] Thank you, sir.

47:21.130 --> 47:24.884
So, is it true that you joined up
a day after 9/11,

47:24.967 --> 47:26.594
or is that just something you say?

47:26.677 --> 47:30.890
- Within 24 hours, honest to God.
- That's incredible.

47:31.474 --> 47:35.060
Hey... I was 25, just out of law school.

47:36.186 --> 47:40.525
You want a career in politics
and the Twin Towers fall in your lap?

47:42.109 --> 47:43.360
Timing couldn't have been better.

47:43.444 --> 47:47.364
- Oh, I see how you won.
- [both chuckling]

47:48.741 --> 47:53.413
- Well, he must be on top of the world.
- I... I can't imagine.

47:53.954 --> 47:56.206
Oh, really?
How old are you? Thirty-five?

47:56.290 --> 47:57.291
Thirty-six.

47:57.374 --> 47:58.834
Oh, you've never thought about it,
late at night?

47:58.918 --> 48:01.336
- The White House?
- What else?

48:01.421 --> 48:03.464
- Have you?
- Haven't we all?

48:04.715 --> 48:06.300
[sighs]

48:06.383 --> 48:10.680
I'm in no rush.
Who knows? Maybe, one day.

48:12.097 --> 48:16.852
Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln.
Tall men make great presidents.

48:16.936 --> 48:19.063
[laughing] It's like you want me to run.

48:19.146 --> 48:20.606
Oh, goodness, no.
You running?

48:20.690 --> 48:22.692
That would be a disaster
for the Democrats.

48:24.777 --> 48:25.986
- I better see my wife.
- [crowd] Ten...

48:26.070 --> 48:27.196
- Me, too.
- [crowd] ...nine,

48:27.279 --> 48:32.201
eight, seven, six, five, four,

48:32.284 --> 48:35.329
three, two, one!

48:35.412 --> 48:39.875
Happy New Year!
[all cheering]

48:41.669 --> 48:43.713
["Auld Lang Syne" playing]

48:49.384 --> 48:51.887
- That was before everything.
- [Claire] <i>I know.</i>

49:06.986 --> 49:08.613
Francis, are you there?

49:10.990 --> 49:12.449
[door opens]

49:23.418 --> 49:25.630
We're going to destroy them.

49:26.130 --> 49:27.673
Yes, we are.
