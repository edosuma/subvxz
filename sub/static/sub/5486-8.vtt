00:01.533 --> 00:03.336
When your fiancee
is across the country

00:03.337 --> 00:04.770
caring for his sick dad,

00:04.771 --> 00:06.572
it's important he knows
that everything back home

00:06.573 --> 00:08.274
is smooth sailing.

00:08.275 --> 00:09.509
Hey, Leo, sweetheart,

00:09.510 --> 00:10.877
you gotta chill, okay?

00:10.878 --> 00:12.578
People are not
liking the screaming.

00:12.579 --> 00:15.448
It's not a good look.

00:15.449 --> 00:16.616
Damn it.

00:16.617 --> 00:18.784
Okay, no one...
no one reach for it or anything.

00:18.785 --> 00:20.286
Just a single mom trying to...

00:20.287 --> 00:23.257
trying to pick up her fruit.

00:25.567 --> 00:27.113
Hey, what's up?

00:27.114 --> 00:28.287
Everything sucks!

00:28.288 --> 00:31.150
Leo's screaming and my first time
buying fruit was a total disas...

00:31.990 --> 00:33.869
Things are tough here.
Dad said he saw Jesus

00:33.870 --> 00:36.247
for a seconds last night.
How are you?

00:37.237 --> 00:39.372
The last thing you want to be
is another problem for him,

00:39.373 --> 00:41.107
so best to just
pretend everything is

00:41.108 --> 00:43.676
smiley face emoji
wearing sunglasses.

00:43.677 --> 00:46.312
What can I say to you?

00:46.313 --> 00:49.348
But Annette, I don't have
anyone else who can watch Leo

00:49.349 --> 00:51.551
and I'm in the middle
of a delivery right now.

00:51.552 --> 00:53.686
No, I do not care if you
have a very important

00:53.687 --> 00:55.922
sweatshirt decorating class.

00:55.923 --> 00:58.157
Hello? Hello?

00:58.158 --> 01:00.534
Damn it.

01:00.535 --> 01:03.263
Danny, you gotta talk to your mom.
I can't do this by myse...

01:03.264 --> 01:06.449
Hey, hon. The Doctor thought dad might
be strong enought for physical therapy.

01:06.450 --> 01:07.699
Oh, thank God.

01:07.700 --> 01:10.350
But then he fell and soiled himself.
How are you?

01:12.000 --> 01:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:19.213 --> 01:22.381
Leo, I think your mom
just made you a playpen.

01:22.382 --> 01:24.150
Oh, God. Okay.

01:24.151 --> 01:25.918
But, it's not easy
running two businesses,

01:25.919 --> 01:28.054
raising a child alone,
and doing Danny's share

01:28.055 --> 01:30.223
of the chores which,
as it turns out,

01:30.224 --> 01:31.624
was all of the chores.

01:34.371 --> 01:37.663
Another turn for the worse.
I need a pep talk babe.

01:37.664 --> 01:39.742
Okay.

01:39.743 --> 01:41.692
You can do this.
I love you!

01:44.062 --> 01:46.339
Why isn't it wearing sunglasses?
Is everything ok?

01:46.340 --> 01:47.807
Oh, come on.

01:48.875 --> 01:51.277
No, no, Leo,
the drill is for Mommy.

01:51.278 --> 01:53.613
Anyway, God, all that I'm asking

01:53.614 --> 01:57.483
is that you let me have this
one bath with no interruptions.

01:57.484 --> 02:00.720
And if you don't, I'm seriously
switching religions to Kabbalah

02:00.721 --> 02:03.289
and then Madonna
can be my god. Okay.

02:03.290 --> 02:04.323
Open up!

02:04.324 --> 02:05.791
It's the masturbation police.

02:05.792 --> 02:07.593
God?

02:07.594 --> 02:09.729
Great news.
I'm your houseguest for the week.

02:09.729 --> 02:12.231
Take care of me.

02:12.232 --> 02:14.796
Oh, my God. Oh no!

02:23.896 --> 02:26.012
Peter,
now is not a good time for me.

02:26.013 --> 02:27.713
- I should have called first.
- Yeah.

02:27.714 --> 02:29.181
I'm sorry.
It was a spur of the moment thing.

02:29.182 --> 02:30.683
- Yeah.
- My wife took the kid

02:30.684 --> 02:33.319
out of town for the week,
so I thought I'd head over here

02:33.320 --> 02:34.987
and party like it's 1999,

02:34.988 --> 02:37.923
which is also the year I briefly
died from alcohol poisoning.

02:37.924 --> 02:39.859
I'm just super busy
and I don't have time

02:39.860 --> 02:41.060
to take care of a houseguest.

02:41.061 --> 02:42.828
As crazy Uncle
Peter to your child,

02:42.829 --> 02:44.964
I demand that you come
out with me and party.

02:44.965 --> 02:47.300
I want to get drunk and climb
the Statue of Liberty.

02:47.301 --> 02:49.001
I want to get hammered
and ride the Cyclone.

02:49.002 --> 02:52.538
I want to sneak beers onto the...
do I have a problem?

02:52.539 --> 02:53.606
Eh.

02:53.607 --> 02:55.141
I cannot talk about
this right now, okay?

02:55.142 --> 02:57.977
I'm very tired, it's very late,
I'm going to go to bed.

02:57.978 --> 03:00.513
No need.
I put caffeine pills in your water,

03:00.514 --> 03:02.281
which is dangerous and scary.

03:02.282 --> 03:03.449
Damn it, Peter.

03:03.450 --> 03:05.430
Oh, God. Leo.

03:06.520 --> 03:07.787
Okay, I don't want
you to be scared,

03:07.788 --> 03:09.188
but I'm going to go
to a meeting right now

03:09.189 --> 03:10.790
and it's very important
so I want you to stay here

03:10.791 --> 03:12.325
and color for a bit.

03:12.326 --> 03:14.327
Mindy, you don't have to
babysit me like a child.

03:14.328 --> 03:16.028
And do you know where
the good crayons are

03:16.029 --> 03:18.464
'cause I lost the ones
the stewardess gave me.

03:18.465 --> 03:20.266
- Peter.
- Hi, Jeremy.

03:20.267 --> 03:22.535
I thought I smelled
Hooters body spray.

03:22.536 --> 03:24.804
High fives. Yeah!

03:24.805 --> 03:25.771
Never quite figured
that one out.

03:25.772 --> 03:27.306
God, where to start.

03:27.307 --> 03:28.507
You know, ever since my breakup,

03:28.508 --> 03:30.776
Jody has been setting me
up with a ton of women.

03:30.777 --> 03:35.014
Just empty, meaningless,
acrobatic sex, Peter.

03:35.015 --> 03:37.216
- Hmm.
- I've never felt more alone.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.851
That can be tough.

03:38.852 --> 03:40.653
Well, listen, we should have
a gentlemen's catch up dinner.

03:40.654 --> 03:42.254
I think we just
gentlemanly caught up.

03:42.255 --> 03:44.090
And besides, Mindy and I have
some quality time booked,

03:44.091 --> 03:45.725
so she's really been
looking forward to it.

03:46.960 --> 03:48.361
Mindy just texted
the entire office saying,

03:48.362 --> 03:51.330
"Can someone take
Peter off my hands?"

03:51.331 --> 03:55.101
- Tonight it is.
- Okay, okay. Looking forward.

03:55.102 --> 03:58.170
Melville, let's talk turkey.

03:58.171 --> 03:59.572
Tell me how much money

03:59.573 --> 04:01.640
the practice has
brought in this quarter,

04:01.641 --> 04:02.775
and I hope it's
at least 3 million

04:02.776 --> 04:04.210
because we have
committed quite a bit

04:04.211 --> 04:06.846
to Zach Braff's
newest Kickstarter.

04:06.847 --> 04:10.847
After expenses, this is how
much your practice has netted.

04:11.651 --> 04:14.019
- Oh, my God. That's great.
- How is that possible?

04:14.020 --> 04:16.922
- It's a negative number!
- What?

04:16.923 --> 04:18.824
You have more money going
out than you have coming in.

04:18.825 --> 04:20.926
- It's as simple as that.
- How did this happen?

04:20.927 --> 04:22.294
Well, you spent
most of your revenue

04:22.295 --> 04:25.431
on something called
the "Later Baby Launch Party."

04:25.432 --> 04:26.465
In retrospect, we shouldn't have

04:26.466 --> 04:27.666
rented out Governor's Island.

04:27.667 --> 04:29.635
Nobody came,
because someone wrote

04:29.636 --> 04:31.704
Riker's Island by accident
on the invitation.

04:31.705 --> 04:33.038
It was me.

04:33.039 --> 04:34.740
If you don't get more
patients in immediately,

04:34.741 --> 04:36.909
your practice will
definitely go under.

04:36.910 --> 04:38.144
If we wanted predictions
on the future,

04:38.145 --> 04:40.312
we'd go to my psychic,
Lady Mysterioso.

04:40.313 --> 04:42.081
We pay you for
accounting advice.

04:42.082 --> 04:44.116
Actually,
you haven't paid me in months,

04:44.117 --> 04:45.951
which is the other
reason I'm here.

04:45.952 --> 04:47.586
Did you see this
negative number?

04:47.587 --> 04:48.788
I just learned what that meant.

04:48.789 --> 04:50.389
Can you just take
your money out of this?

04:53.727 --> 04:55.728
Morning.

04:55.729 --> 04:57.129
Are we looking for something?

04:57.130 --> 04:59.532
My energy drink.
It's called Heart Attack Fuel.

04:59.533 --> 05:00.933
It's in a big red can.

05:00.934 --> 05:02.935
There's a picture of a heart
on it giving the finger.

05:02.936 --> 05:04.103
I threw it out.

05:04.104 --> 05:05.805
FDA banned that stuff
after those teens

05:05.806 --> 05:07.206
danced themselves to death.

05:07.207 --> 05:09.141
How dare you throw
out my energy drink?

05:09.142 --> 05:11.644
That's the only way I know how
to wake up in the morning, Jody.

05:11.645 --> 05:13.846
I spent half the night awake
because my baby was crying

05:13.847 --> 05:16.148
and the other half awake
because Peter was crying.

05:16.149 --> 05:18.083
He decided to play Danny's
piano with his penis

05:18.084 --> 05:20.152
and the lid shut right on it.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.287
Are you all right?

05:21.288 --> 05:22.688
I feel like since
your fiancee left,

05:22.689 --> 05:25.057
you've really started
dressing down.

05:25.058 --> 05:26.325
Exsqueeze me?

05:26.326 --> 05:27.893
I liked how you used to dress,
all bright and colorful

05:27.894 --> 05:29.395
like the homosexual flag.

05:29.396 --> 05:31.497
I do not need to
take fashion advice

05:31.498 --> 05:33.365
from some guy who's
wearing the same clothes

05:33.366 --> 05:34.600
as he did yesterday.

05:34.601 --> 05:36.535
My slovenly appearance
is the result

05:36.536 --> 05:38.070
of an erotic exploit,

05:38.071 --> 05:39.572
not the early warning
signs of depression.

05:39.573 --> 05:42.074
Depression?
I don't think so, pal.

05:42.075 --> 05:43.709
Would a depressed
person have the energy

05:43.710 --> 05:45.478
to drink two bottles
of wine a night?

05:45.479 --> 05:46.745
Is there anything
I can do to help?

05:46.746 --> 05:48.180
There's a lot you could do,
actually.

05:48.181 --> 05:49.849
You could maybe convince
my fiancee to come back

05:49.850 --> 05:51.851
from California and help
take care of our kid,

05:51.852 --> 05:54.386
you get me some more patients
for my fertility clinic,

05:54.387 --> 05:56.121
you can take out
my episiotomy stitches,

05:56.122 --> 05:59.191
which it turns out are
not the dissolvable kind.

05:59.192 --> 06:00.960
Now, I need to go wake up.

06:00.961 --> 06:04.363
Morgan? Come here.
I need you to slap me in the face.

06:04.364 --> 06:06.966
Dr. Reed,
you know I'm not a dramatic person.

06:06.967 --> 06:09.134
With respect,
you started an office drama club

06:09.135 --> 06:10.469
but then didn't put on a play

06:10.470 --> 06:12.605
because there was too much
behind-the-scenes drama.

06:12.606 --> 06:14.373
Nonetheless...

06:14.374 --> 06:16.208
I can't share
an office with Colette.

06:16.209 --> 06:17.676
She keeps pranking me.

06:17.677 --> 06:20.546
It's not my fault Tamra
doesn't have a sense of humor

06:20.547 --> 06:22.147
and she's like, "Ugh."

06:22.148 --> 06:25.251
I just don't think leaving
this on my chair is funny.

06:25.252 --> 06:27.486
It was so funny.

06:27.487 --> 06:30.623
I like smart comedy
that says something about society.

06:30.624 --> 06:31.857
Or Tosh.

06:31.858 --> 06:33.792
Anything exciting
going on in this room?

06:33.793 --> 06:35.060
Peter, you'll enjoy this.

06:35.061 --> 06:37.129
I'm setting a little
nurse dispute.

06:37.130 --> 06:41.400
Okay, back at boarding school,
whenever two boys had a spat,

06:41.401 --> 06:43.602
matron would make them hold
a bean against the wall

06:43.603 --> 06:46.205
with their noses
until they were friends again.

06:46.206 --> 06:48.440
So, observe.

06:48.441 --> 06:50.543
I got a better idea
than holding all these beans.

06:50.544 --> 06:54.213
Why don't you two come to
dinner with Jeremy and I tonight

06:54.214 --> 06:55.748
and we can talk this all out?

06:55.749 --> 06:58.150
That was meant to be a guy's
dinner just for us to catch up.

06:58.151 --> 07:00.019
Now ladies, bean your nose.

07:00.020 --> 07:01.020
What do you guys say?

07:01.021 --> 07:03.188
- Whatevs.
- I love food.

07:03.189 --> 07:05.724
Somebody going to pick
me up or just Uber there?

07:05.725 --> 07:08.527
You're quiet because
you're beaning your noses?

07:08.528 --> 07:09.762
Ha, right there.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.263
How much money did you
spend on this again?

07:11.264 --> 07:12.598
- One grand.
- Oh, God.

07:12.599 --> 07:16.368
I know, but all of a sudden,
circular motion,

07:16.369 --> 07:18.537
like the over-the-back
stand kind of like...

07:18.538 --> 07:21.574
Oh! Oh, God. Oh, God, Morgan.

07:21.575 --> 07:23.909
Fear no more.
You savior has arrived.

07:23.910 --> 07:25.110
Is the Rapture here?

07:25.111 --> 07:27.079
Thank God,
'cause this business is going under.

07:27.080 --> 07:28.347
I've come up with a genius plan

07:28.348 --> 07:30.849
to save your practice, Mindy.
As you requested.

07:30.850 --> 07:32.451
When I said that,
I was obviously being sarcastic,

07:32.452 --> 07:34.153
like whenever
I complement a woman.

07:34.154 --> 07:35.254
Morgan and I don't
need your help.

07:35.255 --> 07:37.089
Ooh, a Rumpelstiltskin
promotion.

07:37.090 --> 07:39.625
We get you pregnant for free,
we keep the first baby.

07:39.626 --> 07:40.793
We're not doing that.
I hate it when you bring it up.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.294
It's illegal.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.330
I know I'm a doctor,
but I'm also an entrepreneur.

07:44.331 --> 07:46.165
I've invested in several
businesses in Georgia,

07:46.166 --> 07:49.101
including a barbecue restaurant
I co-own with Annie Potts.

07:49.102 --> 07:51.103
She's just as nice
as you might suspect.

07:51.104 --> 07:52.871
Talk to me about
the side dishes there.

07:52.872 --> 07:54.239
Wait, what is your idea?

07:54.240 --> 07:55.507
If you want to attract
younger patients

07:55.508 --> 07:57.209
to Later, Baby,
go to the source.

07:57.210 --> 07:59.244
Start doing presentations
in colleges.

07:59.245 --> 08:00.913
Ooh. That's good.

08:00.914 --> 08:03.515
I've taken the liberty
of calling NYU.

08:03.516 --> 08:05.684
I'll be taking a 50%
stake in your business.

08:05.685 --> 08:08.220
Thank you.
We'd be ruined without you.

08:08.221 --> 08:09.655
Abso-tute-ly not.

08:09.656 --> 08:12.558
Morgan and I would never go into
business with someone like you.

08:12.559 --> 08:14.593
Someone like...
I'm a decent fellow.

08:14.594 --> 08:16.295
Earlier today
I winked at a fat woman.

08:16.296 --> 08:18.564
You're a creep,
and I think your pocket square

08:18.565 --> 08:20.933
is a pair of women's panties,
and you know what else?

08:20.934 --> 08:22.801
Your crappy idea
wasn't even that good,

08:22.802 --> 08:24.203
so why don't you
hit the road, Jack?

08:24.204 --> 08:25.404
Hit the road, Jack.

08:25.405 --> 08:27.006
All right, suit yourself.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.374
- Just cut it out.
- Go, go, go, go.

08:28.375 --> 08:29.541
Get out of here, you loser.

08:29.542 --> 08:30.609
That was an amazing idea.

08:30.610 --> 08:32.144
Obviously that was
an awesome idea

08:32.145 --> 08:33.145
and we're definitely
going to do it.

08:33.145 --> 08:34.847
We're just not
going to tell Jody.

08:34.847 --> 08:37.982
- But that's stealing.
- You can steal an idea, Morgan.

08:37.984 --> 08:40.419
It's like stuff in the drugstore
that can fit in your pocket.

08:40.419 --> 08:42.254
It's up for grabs.
Now, call NYU.

08:42.255 --> 08:43.255
I'm sorry,
how is that not stealing?

08:43.256 --> 08:44.255
Just call NYU!

08:48.699 --> 08:50.396
I'm no professional therapist,
but I did help

08:50.397 --> 08:52.931
my frat brother Pube
come out to his parents.

08:52.932 --> 08:54.533
He's now known as Vag.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.035
So why don't you tell
me what's going on here?

08:56.036 --> 08:57.870
Colette is constantly
pranking me.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.972
She dipped my braid in paint.

08:59.973 --> 09:01.607
That's some Tom Sawyer-ish.

09:01.608 --> 09:04.510
If you hated it so much,
why didn't you wash it out?

09:04.511 --> 09:06.845
To make it look like
an intentional fashion choice.

09:06.846 --> 09:08.547
Now the Style Section want
to write a blurb about it

09:08.548 --> 09:09.982
and I don't have time for that.

09:09.983 --> 09:11.483
Ow! I'm not as strong as I look.

09:11.484 --> 09:15.287
All right.
Ladies, ladies. Please.

09:15.288 --> 09:17.956
Let me tell you guys
a story about two people

09:17.957 --> 09:20.025
who didn't get along at first

09:20.026 --> 09:22.294
but grew to be
the closest of friends.

09:22.295 --> 09:23.896
Me and Jeremy.

09:23.897 --> 09:26.098
This should be good.
Let's hear it.

09:26.099 --> 09:27.800
Well, when I first
started working here,

09:27.801 --> 09:29.368
Jeremy and I hated each other.

09:29.369 --> 09:31.503
Did we? News to me.

09:31.504 --> 09:34.006
Came to be,
he was the best man at my wedding.

09:34.007 --> 09:35.307
I was your fourth choice,

09:35.308 --> 09:38.510
and I got only one dance
with you the whole night.

09:38.511 --> 09:40.713
Well, now we're all good.

09:40.714 --> 09:42.114
What I'm trying to say...

09:42.115 --> 09:44.116
We're not that good.

09:44.117 --> 09:45.552
Oh.

09:47.821 --> 09:49.755
It is very challenging to
prepare for this presentation

09:49.756 --> 09:51.090
when we have so little time.

09:51.091 --> 09:53.158
Yeah, I know.
Okay, and guess what?

09:53.159 --> 09:54.259
- Ow!
- You gotta nail it.

09:54.260 --> 09:56.395
You, madam,
are a downright dirty thief.

09:56.396 --> 09:58.664
Damn it!
Where did you find that?

09:58.665 --> 10:01.467
I just followed
the stench of a rotten deed.

10:01.468 --> 10:03.001
I deserve a piece
of your business.

10:03.002 --> 10:06.105
A piece of my business?
I don't think so, pal.

10:06.106 --> 10:07.539
He doesn't even have
a piece and he does, like,

10:07.540 --> 10:08.640
- half the work.
- Yeah.

10:08.641 --> 10:10.509
- So...
- We should talk about that.

10:10.510 --> 10:11.910
I've been cleaning.

10:11.911 --> 10:13.479
I've been doing custodial
stuff a lot on the side.

10:13.480 --> 10:14.646
Hold on. I've got a call. Okay.

10:14.647 --> 10:15.881
It's Annette.
I've got to take this.

10:15.882 --> 10:17.015
It's a family thing.
You have to wait.

10:17.016 --> 10:19.785
Hey, Annette. What's going on?

10:19.786 --> 10:21.620
You're sick?

10:21.621 --> 10:24.256
Why didn't you get the flu shot?

10:24.257 --> 10:25.958
No, you can't get autism.
You're too old. Okay.

10:25.959 --> 10:28.727
Yes, I'll be over. I'll get Leo.

10:28.728 --> 10:29.962
Everything okay?

10:29.963 --> 10:31.764
I have to go pick up
Leo from Annette's.

10:31.765 --> 10:33.232
I don't know how I'm going to
prepare for this presentation.

10:33.233 --> 10:34.266
Okay, you're not going anywhere.

10:34.267 --> 10:35.267
You're going to sit
there on your butt

10:35.268 --> 10:36.702
and you're going to practice.

10:36.703 --> 10:39.438
If you don't have time to prepare,
you could let, say,

10:39.439 --> 10:41.740
your new partner give
the presentation.

10:41.741 --> 10:43.876
I don't know how to explain
this to you but, like,

10:43.877 --> 10:45.177
you're not my partner,

10:45.178 --> 10:46.845
I'm going to be doing this
presentation by myself,

10:46.846 --> 10:48.480
it's going to be
as compelling as a TED Talk,

10:48.481 --> 10:51.116
and as funny as "Ted 2." Okay?
Good-bye.

10:51.117 --> 10:55.087
This isn't over!
I will not be cheated!

10:55.088 --> 10:57.193
This is Annie Potts
all over again.

10:58.424 --> 10:59.558
You complain about
Mindy being a bad friend

10:59.559 --> 11:00.893
'cause she won't drop everything

11:00.894 --> 11:02.828
the second you waltz into town.

11:02.829 --> 11:04.530
What about what you did to me?

11:04.531 --> 11:07.099
What'd he do? Say it's weird
for an adult man to own a bird?

11:07.100 --> 11:08.667
No, this has nothing
to do with Roger.

11:08.668 --> 11:11.537
Okay, I went to stay with
Peter in Austin last month,

11:11.538 --> 11:12.938
and I had a terrible time.

11:12.939 --> 11:14.339
Of course,
'cause the chain stores

11:14.340 --> 11:17.109
are sapping Austin's quirk.
It's a real dilemma.

11:17.110 --> 11:18.777
No, because you were
a terrible host.

11:18.778 --> 11:21.180
He insists I stay with him,
then the second I arrive

11:21.181 --> 11:24.283
- he dumps me at a motel.
- That sucks nard.

11:24.284 --> 11:26.585
Colette,
you have no idea the nard it sucked.

11:26.586 --> 11:29.822
Every activity I had planned
that weekend, Peter ruined.

11:29.823 --> 11:31.123
Like, we went to dinner

11:31.124 --> 11:33.158
and you just stared at
your phone the whole time.

11:33.159 --> 11:35.027
I was live-Tweeting
how mad at me you were.

11:35.028 --> 11:37.062
Then the Saturday night,
I get tickets for us

11:37.063 --> 11:40.699
to see the Dixie Chicks, halfway
through "Cowboy Take Me Away"

11:40.700 --> 11:42.835
you leave, knowing full well

11:42.836 --> 11:45.270
that that song has
always reminded me of us.

11:45.271 --> 11:46.738
Damn, that's cold.

11:46.739 --> 11:49.041
At least wait until Natalie
Maines starts talking politics

11:49.042 --> 11:50.809
and everyone gets up
to go to the snack bar.

11:50.810 --> 11:52.177
Wait till she starts
talking politics.

11:52.178 --> 11:54.513
Is that so hard?
And here we are again.

11:54.514 --> 11:56.281
You can't even have
a dinner alone with me

11:56.282 --> 11:59.518
without inviting two buffers.
No offense.

11:59.519 --> 12:02.855
You, sir, should not be
giving friendship advice,

12:02.856 --> 12:06.425
'cause you're a horrible friend.

12:06.426 --> 12:07.593
Oh, no, Jeremy, don't go.

12:07.594 --> 12:09.515
No!

12:10.930 --> 12:12.397
Do you guys want to
get the souffle,

12:12.398 --> 12:14.533
'cause if we want it,
we have to...

12:14.534 --> 12:17.069
gotta act fast.

12:17.070 --> 12:19.204
Ovulation is triggered
with an injection

12:19.205 --> 12:22.875
of human chorionic gonadotropin.

12:22.876 --> 12:25.744
Okay, I know, my speech is
very boring, Leo, right?

12:25.745 --> 12:28.614
It's just
that the material is so dry.

12:28.615 --> 12:31.583
Unlike you, who is very wet.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.986
Okay.

12:33.987 --> 12:37.590
- Come on.
- We out of diapers?

12:41.761 --> 12:43.228
Oh, come on!

12:43.229 --> 12:46.131
You know what, Leo? We all gave
Precious's mom a hard time,

12:46.132 --> 12:49.201
but I get it now.
This single mom stuff sucks.

12:49.202 --> 12:50.736
Two hours later,
your diaper's on,

12:50.737 --> 12:53.506
and you're finally ready
to get back to work.

12:55.675 --> 12:59.675
Oh, cool. I just wiped
you with my presentation.

13:00.713 --> 13:03.015
What's wrong with you,
you butthole?

13:03.016 --> 13:04.416
Yeah, you're a bad friend,

13:04.417 --> 13:06.018
and one time I didn't
pick up cousin Sheena

13:06.019 --> 13:07.486
from the airport for two days.

13:07.487 --> 13:09.888
I am not a bad friend.
I just had other stuff going on.

13:09.889 --> 13:12.591
You don't leave a delicate
British man alone in Texas.

13:12.592 --> 13:14.393
He carries a parasol in the sun.

13:14.394 --> 13:16.862
Yeah, and it sucks to be
alone in a strange city.

13:16.863 --> 13:20.632
Last weekend I went out on
a Central Park rowboat by myself.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.534
People thought I was
trying to dump a body.

13:22.535 --> 13:25.070
- You did?
- I didn't dump a body, but...

13:25.071 --> 13:26.538
I was by myself.

13:26.539 --> 13:28.907
Well, maybe if you
weren't always pranking me

13:28.908 --> 13:30.676
then you'd actually have
a friend to do stuff with.

13:30.677 --> 13:32.678
Well, maybe that's why
I keep pranking you,

13:32.679 --> 13:36.415
- so you can't ignore me.
- Really?

13:36.416 --> 13:38.016
That's hella counter-intuitive.

13:38.017 --> 13:41.687
I know. I'm really sorry.

13:41.688 --> 13:44.589
It's just,
Southern people are complicated.

13:44.590 --> 13:47.626
The two things we're known for
are being friendly and slavery.

13:47.627 --> 13:50.262
- Okay, don't say that.
- Oh.

13:50.263 --> 13:51.863
But, you know, Colette,
I'd rather be a good friend

13:51.864 --> 13:54.199
than be a jerk like Dr. P.

13:54.200 --> 13:55.367
I told you guys
bringing you here

13:55.368 --> 13:56.702
would solve all your problems.

13:56.703 --> 13:58.638
- We hate you.
- Shut up.

14:04.210 --> 14:06.078
- Hey, sleepy head.
- What time is it?

14:06.079 --> 14:08.714
It's about 11:00. I let you
sleep in, took care of Leo.

14:08.715 --> 14:09.948
You've been so busy lately.

14:09.949 --> 14:12.117
Oh, my God!
I'm missing my presentation!

14:12.118 --> 14:13.585
Peter,
why didn't you wake me up?

14:13.586 --> 14:14.720
Because you've
been so exhausted,

14:14.721 --> 14:15.787
I thought I'd let you rest.

14:15.788 --> 14:17.022
Aren't I a good friend?

14:17.023 --> 14:19.825
No, you are not a good friend.
Watch Leo!

14:19.826 --> 14:21.647
A lot of people been
saying that lately.

14:23.029 --> 14:25.030
And that's the best
part about Later, Baby.

14:25.031 --> 14:27.733
You give
your future self options.

14:27.734 --> 14:29.067
And your future self can use
all the help she can get,

14:29.068 --> 14:30.569
am I right?

14:30.570 --> 14:31.603
She'll be coming out of here
with a pile of student debt...

14:31.604 --> 14:32.771
Hey!

14:32.772 --> 14:34.506
A useless degree
and French literature

14:34.507 --> 14:36.775
four years of regrettable
Facebook photos.

14:38.644 --> 14:40.345
- How's it going?
- He is killing it.

14:40.346 --> 14:42.647
Jody's a totally
captivating performer,

14:42.648 --> 14:44.483
and the audience isn't nervous
for him when he's on stage

14:44.484 --> 14:45.484
like they are with you.

14:45.485 --> 14:48.186
Yeah, he actually
is pretty good.

14:48.187 --> 14:49.254
Thank you for coming today.

14:49.255 --> 14:50.789
Are there any
questions I can answer?

14:50.790 --> 14:52.858
- I have a question.
- Yes, miss.

14:52.859 --> 14:54.292
Why did you have sex with me

14:54.293 --> 14:56.495
if you were also having sex
with three others in my dorm?

14:58.598 --> 15:01.100
Nope, I was right the first time.
He's a bad guy.

15:06.105 --> 15:07.105
He can bail himself out.
Recover, recover.

15:07.106 --> 15:09.241
He slept with me too.

15:09.242 --> 15:10.809
Me, too. How could you do that?

15:10.810 --> 15:13.478
Maddie and I are roommates.
We share a Brita.

15:13.479 --> 15:16.448
It's true,
I have made love to a lot of you.

15:16.449 --> 15:18.150
Distract them.

15:18.151 --> 15:22.687
- Please, if you'd hold on...
- No, no, no. Nobody move.

15:22.688 --> 15:24.623
Don't leave.

15:24.624 --> 15:28.293
Prepare to be amazed
and distracted

15:28.294 --> 15:32.497
as I, Morgan Fairchild Tookers
do something I've never done:

15:32.498 --> 15:33.999
Nail a backflip.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.101
That's who you've been
having erotic exploits with?

15:36.102 --> 15:37.402
These college girls?

15:37.403 --> 15:40.105
Yes, but the silver
lining is that

15:40.106 --> 15:42.808
by making love with
Maddie and her dorm mates

15:42.809 --> 15:45.410
I got this great idea
for your business.

15:45.411 --> 15:47.846
It is not acceptable to
have sex with 18-year-olds.

15:47.847 --> 15:49.481
I agree, it was distasteful.

15:49.482 --> 15:51.149
No, it was gross, you old perv.

15:51.150 --> 15:52.751
The only reason you're
even with these girls

15:52.752 --> 15:53.819
is that they're the only
ones that can stand you

15:53.820 --> 15:55.253
for more than a night.

15:55.254 --> 15:59.925
You're right, I am,
as you say, an old perv.

15:59.926 --> 16:03.728
Oh, God. Are you crying?

16:03.729 --> 16:04.796
What is this weird move?

16:04.797 --> 16:08.033
I made love with these girls

16:08.034 --> 16:10.769
because I'm in love with a woman
that I can never have again.

16:10.770 --> 16:12.871
- Who?
- Anne-Marie...

16:12.872 --> 16:16.141
the wife of my brother.

16:16.142 --> 16:17.275
Why didn't you gasp?

16:17.276 --> 16:19.177
Honestly,
that seems on-brand for you.

16:19.178 --> 16:21.346
I've been quietly in
love with her for years,

16:21.347 --> 16:24.683
but a few months ago,
I began to quietly do her.

16:24.684 --> 16:26.585
That's why I had to leave
Georgia with such haste,

16:26.586 --> 16:29.354
because my brother would never
forgive me if he found out

16:29.355 --> 16:31.823
that I'd been defiling his wife.

16:31.824 --> 16:33.992
Oh, and I do me defiling.

16:33.993 --> 16:37.295
Oh, God. Gross, stop it.

16:37.296 --> 16:39.531
I sleep with these co-eds
to fill the void in my heart

16:39.532 --> 16:41.666
left by Anne-Marie,

16:41.667 --> 16:44.002
and because they're
hot and it's fun.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.004
What a weird story.

16:46.005 --> 16:48.073
Why not just go after
a woman your own age?

16:48.074 --> 16:49.774
You know who's like
your intellectual peer?

16:49.775 --> 16:51.309
No, I'm tall and handsome.

16:51.310 --> 16:53.311
I'm sure it won't
come to that, but...

16:53.312 --> 16:56.648
I am sorry that I messed up
your chance to save your practice.

16:56.649 --> 16:58.950
- Well...
- Your company is a joke!

16:58.951 --> 17:00.686
Come on, Morgan, you can do it.

17:02.388 --> 17:03.688
- Come on already!
- That...

17:03.689 --> 17:06.324
- Get... get into it, you know?
- Hey, seriously?

17:06.325 --> 17:09.426
Maybe I still can.

17:09.428 --> 17:12.365
Ah! Ah! Ah!

17:14.599 --> 17:16.800
That was... Did you see it?

17:16.801 --> 17:18.002
Did you see it?
I did a back flip.

17:18.003 --> 17:19.436
No, I didn't see it.
It was probably bad.

17:19.438 --> 17:21.272
Just go... go, go, go.
No, it probably sucked.

17:21.273 --> 17:22.473
I didn't see it.
It probably sucked.

17:22.474 --> 17:24.209
Just get off the stage.
Thank you.

17:24.210 --> 17:25.644
Hey, everybody.

17:25.645 --> 17:27.479
Um, my name is Dr. Mindy Lahiri

17:27.480 --> 17:29.548
and I just want to apologize

17:29.549 --> 17:31.049
for my colleague
Jody's behavior.

17:32.785 --> 17:35.253
I know, I know, I know, he sucks.
All right?

17:35.254 --> 17:37.222
But let's be honest, guys.

17:37.223 --> 17:39.991
- Most men are complete garbage.
- It's true!

17:39.992 --> 17:41.726
We are!

17:41.727 --> 17:43.528
Okay, listen, listen.

17:43.529 --> 17:45.697
When I was your age, I thought
that I was gonna be married

17:45.698 --> 17:47.732
by the time I was 25,

17:47.733 --> 17:49.367
but it took a lot
longer than that,

17:49.368 --> 17:51.469
and unfortunately,
your body does not care

17:51.470 --> 17:53.371
if you are dating the wrong guy

17:53.372 --> 17:54.973
or the guy you're
with is also sleeping

17:54.974 --> 17:56.641
with the rest of your dorm.

17:56.642 --> 17:59.911
Your body and your eggs
just keep getting older

17:59.912 --> 18:04.049
which is why freezing them is
actually a pretty smart idea,

18:04.050 --> 18:06.017
'cause it gives you
a little bit more time

18:06.018 --> 18:08.887
so that you can try to
find that one diamond

18:08.888 --> 18:11.423
in the crap heap
of American men,

18:11.424 --> 18:13.491
because even if you
find the right guy,

18:13.492 --> 18:15.627
you're going to want
a little extra time.

18:15.628 --> 18:16.861
I mean, look at me.

18:16.862 --> 18:19.231
I'm so busy I wear
my pajamas everywhere,

18:19.232 --> 18:22.133
and I'm pretty convinced that I will
take my episiotomy stitches

18:22.134 --> 18:23.602
with me to the grave.

18:23.603 --> 18:27.603
It's because being
adult is messy and hard.

18:28.908 --> 18:32.815
It's not just all smiley face
emojis wearing sunglasses.

18:35.581 --> 18:37.582
Seriously?

18:37.583 --> 18:40.219
Whoa, you like that?

18:49.028 --> 18:50.963
Were you expecting anyone,
Roger?

18:54.500 --> 18:58.632
♪ Cowboy, take me away ♪

18:58.892 --> 19:01.973
♪ Fly this girl as high
as you can into the... ♪

19:01.974 --> 19:03.308
I can't do this.
It's so embarrassing.

19:03.309 --> 19:07.212
Peter. Come in.

19:07.213 --> 19:09.948
Make it quick though.
This is Roger time.

19:09.949 --> 19:11.950
Look, I'm sorry
that I was such a terrible host

19:11.951 --> 19:13.218
when you were in Austin.

19:13.219 --> 19:16.421
I wasn't blowing you off.
I was embarrassed.

19:16.422 --> 19:17.522
Of what?

19:17.523 --> 19:19.858
My chaps?
My little red cowboy hat?

19:19.859 --> 19:22.927
No, not those things
specifically, but...

19:22.928 --> 19:23.962
Thank you.

19:23.963 --> 19:25.463
I was embarrassed about myself.

19:25.464 --> 19:27.299
I mean, I used to be,
like, a cool dude.

19:27.300 --> 19:28.800
Now I'm just a whipped-ass dad.

19:28.801 --> 19:30.702
You're just saying
that to make me feel better.

19:30.703 --> 19:32.137
Do you know why you couldn't
stay with me in Austin?

19:32.138 --> 19:33.838
It's 'cause
my in-laws were in town,

19:33.839 --> 19:36.341
I had to sleep on the porch,
and I got peed on by a coyote.

19:36.342 --> 19:38.043
What about the phone at dinner?

19:38.044 --> 19:39.444
What about the concert?

19:39.445 --> 19:41.046
I was doing my fantasy
football draft at dinner

19:41.047 --> 19:42.614
'cause I can't mention
sports in the house

19:42.615 --> 19:45.417
or I lose TV for a week.

19:45.418 --> 19:47.218
Such are the depths
of my whipped-ness.

19:47.219 --> 19:48.920
You thought I would
think less of you?

19:48.921 --> 19:52.023
When I lived here,
I was so much cooler than you,

19:52.024 --> 19:55.260
and now your nips deep in all
this schnizz, and I'm like,

19:55.261 --> 19:57.462
"Where does
that leave me?" You know?

19:57.463 --> 19:59.731
Less cool
than my least cool friend.

19:59.732 --> 20:02.600
Friend?

20:02.601 --> 20:04.836
Oh, my God, Peter.

20:04.837 --> 20:06.304
Thank you for saying that.

20:06.305 --> 20:08.373
You know what?
I've been ignoring you on this trip.

20:08.374 --> 20:09.774
And that ends now.

20:09.775 --> 20:12.110
From this moment forward,
I'm going to stay with you

20:12.111 --> 20:13.712
while I'm in New York City.

20:13.713 --> 20:15.513
That's... great.

20:15.514 --> 20:16.681
I mean, tonight might be tricky

20:16.682 --> 20:17.816
'cause I kind of
have a date coming.

20:17.817 --> 20:19.818
A date, great.
Tell her to come by.

20:19.819 --> 20:21.419
I'll do nothing but listen.

20:21.420 --> 20:24.856
Unrelated,
where do you keep the lotion?

20:24.857 --> 20:26.659
- Bathroom.
- The bathroom.

20:28.094 --> 20:29.661
Well, the good news
is you're not dying

20:29.662 --> 20:31.730
which is frankly
quite a surprise.

20:31.731 --> 20:34.032
Thanks for taking
out my stitches.

20:34.033 --> 20:36.234
You were right. I have not
been taking care of myself.

20:36.235 --> 20:39.437
Well, your vajazzlement
could use some maintenance.

20:39.438 --> 20:41.806
There's nothing but a thicket
of rhinestones down there.

20:41.807 --> 20:43.842
It was once cool, though.
It said "Eat here."

20:43.843 --> 20:45.176
Mm-hmm.

20:45.177 --> 20:47.312
Hey, do you think that you
can be my OB-GYN from now on?

20:47.313 --> 20:48.580
Sure.

20:48.581 --> 20:51.082
And, uh,
I'm sorry about earlier.

20:51.083 --> 20:53.184
I should have disclosed
that my business idea

20:53.185 --> 20:54.986
was borne of ignominy.

20:54.987 --> 20:56.354
I actually have a secret too.

20:56.355 --> 20:57.622
Your trip to Europe last year

20:57.623 --> 20:59.824
was actually a brief stint in jail?
They told me.

20:59.825 --> 21:02.160
Since Danny's been gone,
I've been pretending I'm fine,

21:02.161 --> 21:04.162
but you know what? I'm not.

21:04.163 --> 21:05.563
I'm really struggling.

21:05.564 --> 21:09.868
Listen, admitting you need
help is no sign of failure.

21:09.869 --> 21:11.469
No one can do it alone.

21:11.470 --> 21:13.304
Mother had a fleet
of help to raise us,

21:13.305 --> 21:16.841
and she still spiraled
into insanity.

21:16.842 --> 21:18.676
Thanks, Jody.

21:18.677 --> 21:22.847
- Wait, are you nice?
- Shh.

21:22.848 --> 21:24.816
Well, I do need your help.

21:24.817 --> 21:27.585
I want you to be my partner,

21:27.586 --> 21:29.821
and we will split
the profits 50-50.

21:29.822 --> 21:33.291
No, no, 50-40,
because Morgan deserves 10%.

21:33.292 --> 21:36.261
Oh, God, oh God, thank you.
Thank you!

21:36.262 --> 21:38.129
Morgan,
are you listening outside the door?

21:38.130 --> 21:41.900
Always! I'm so happy
I'm going to do a back flip.

21:43.702 --> 21:45.170
- Oh.
