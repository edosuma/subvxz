01:05.098 --> 01:10.614
# Once a native maiden and a stranger met

01:10.656 --> 01:15.571
# Underneath a blue Tahitian moon

01:15.616 --> 01:18.528
# The stars were in her eyes

01:18.576 --> 01:21.850
# Gardenias in her hair

01:21.894 --> 01:27.208
# And they vowed to care forever

01:27.255 --> 01:32.930
# Then one lonely day
the stranger sailed away

01:32.973 --> 01:36.602
# With a parting kiss that came too soon

01:37.973 --> 01:40.612
# And now the trade winds sigh

01:40.653 --> 01:43.529
# When ships go sailing by... #

01:43.571 --> 01:47.849
<i>This country is at war with Germany.</i>

01:53.089 --> 01:57.719
# Once a native maiden and a stranger met

01:58.369 --> 02:02.406
# Underneath a blue Tahitian moon

02:03.287 --> 02:06.360
# The stars were in her eyes

02:06.408 --> 02:09.479
# Gardenias in her hair #

02:09.527 --> 02:12.916
<i>Down here
on the platform of Piccadilly Tube station</i>

02:12.966 --> 02:16.402
<i>in the heart of London's West End....</i>

02:16.446 --> 02:19.085
<i>Many are bombed out of their homes...</i>

02:19.126 --> 02:22.356
<i>... today of the evacuation
of London's schoolchildren.</i>

02:24.364 --> 02:27.401
<i>... two attacks against London
and Southeast England.</i>

02:27.444 --> 02:30.481
<i>... 200 feet below ground,
but they feel safe here.</i>

02:30.524 --> 02:32.320
# When ships go sailing by

02:32.363 --> 02:36.799
# Underneath a blue Tahitian moon #

03:06.237 --> 03:09.434
But you're not a coward.
- I don't want to die.

03:09.477 --> 03:12.116
And why should I? And if I don't,
why should anyone else?

03:12.157 --> 03:14.988
Yet, still,
you wouldn't make peace now.

03:15.035 --> 03:18.823
Not now. You wouldn't support that.
You couldn't.

03:18.875 --> 03:21.709
You've only got the one life, Anita. Just the one.

03:21.756 --> 03:22.950
Dylan?

03:23.955 --> 03:25.512
Is it?

03:26.754 --> 03:28.472
Dylan Thomas. It is, isn't it?

03:28.514 --> 03:30.152
Oh, my God.

03:31.474 --> 03:34.670
- You might at least have lifted my veil!
- Oh, my God. Still love me?

03:34.713 --> 03:37.180
- Did I ever?
- Lift the bloody veil, Vera.

03:40.712 --> 03:43.146
Look at you.

03:43.192 --> 03:45.465
Look at you. Not been called up?

03:45.510 --> 03:49.423
Just because I haven't got a uniform.
It's me that puts the heart in the nation.

03:49.470 --> 03:51.381
Ammo factories, I sing in.

03:51.430 --> 03:54.785
- Down the tubes right now.
- I always loved your voice. Always.

03:54.829 --> 03:57.467
- Amongst other things, I loved...
- Don't you come it, Dylan Thomas!

03:57.508 --> 03:59.578
- You haven't changed.
- Course I have, thank God.

03:59.628 --> 04:01.859
You can't. And don't. Not ever.

04:01.909 --> 04:04.423
If you do, I won't let you.

04:04.469 --> 04:06.697
I heard you on the radio.

04:07.507 --> 04:11.136
Like going home, it was, your poems.
Like going back.

04:12.067 --> 04:14.978
- Where's the posh accent from?
- You should've looked me up.

04:15.026 --> 04:16.902
- Should I?
- Mm.

04:18.584 --> 04:22.703
If I can get all my friends to donate
five bob each, this is the plan, see.

04:22.745 --> 04:26.941
If I get them all to do that, I don't have to sell
my soul writing bloody propaganda films.

04:26.983 --> 04:30.259
- I can write my bloody poetry.
- You'd have to join the army.

04:30.303 --> 04:32.942
Grade Three sitting here before you, Vera.

04:32.983 --> 04:36.213
Lungs raddled like a Sunday whore.

04:38.741 --> 04:42.132
So... lend us five bob.

04:42.982 --> 04:46.451
- I'll give you a snout, that's all you'll get.
- Oh. Give us, then.

04:47.820 --> 04:52.098
- Silver's for the lonely, Vera Bera.
- Who says I'm lonely?

04:52.140 --> 04:55.291
- Well, where's the man who'll give you gold?
- That an offer, is it?

04:55.340 --> 04:58.614
- It's always been shares with us.
- You never had anything to share.

04:58.658 --> 05:02.207
Yes, but if I did,
if ever I did, you'd be the first.

05:02.258 --> 05:06.535
There's no folks like home folks.
And folks you've grown up with...

05:08.616 --> 05:10.846
...they're the best of all.

05:13.176 --> 05:15.451
- You win.
- Goody.

05:20.615 --> 05:22.207
Forever and always.

05:24.735 --> 05:26.373
You won't, will you?

05:26.415 --> 05:28.973
- Won't what, lovely?
- Get lost again?

05:41.131 --> 05:42.803
Ta, mate.

06:01.008 --> 06:04.205
Hello, love!

06:13.006 --> 06:15.520
<i>I have longed to move away</i>

06:15.566 --> 06:18.398
<i>From the hissing of the spent lie</i>

06:18.445 --> 06:21.914
<i>And the old terrors' continual cry</i>

06:21.964 --> 06:23.397
<i>Growing more terrible</i>

06:23.444 --> 06:27.323
<i>As the day goes over the hill
into the deep sea</i>

06:28.123 --> 06:30.398
<i>I have longed to move away</i>

06:30.443 --> 06:33.320
<i>From the repetition of salutes</i>

06:33.362 --> 06:35.831
<i>For there are ghosts in the air</i>

06:35.883 --> 06:37.953
<i>And ghostly echoes on paper</i>

06:39.922 --> 06:43.516
<i>This is Dylan Thomas
for the BBC Home Service.</i>

06:50.400 --> 06:53.072
- Hello, darling!
- Where you going?

06:53.119 --> 06:54.472
<i>Tension, four hundredweight.</i>

06:54.519 --> 06:58.671
The commentary has to persuade
women to join the balloon defences.

06:58.719 --> 07:02.676
"Shaft a Jerry and maybe one of our
boys will shaft you." That do you?

07:02.717 --> 07:05.948
Your talents really are wasted here, Dylan.

07:05.997 --> 07:09.147
We could have a drink if you like? After.

07:09.196 --> 07:12.346
- Course we could.
- I'm not a bloody dog, Dylan.

07:12.395 --> 07:14.466
It's the brunette, isn't it?

07:16.556 --> 07:21.026
I had a golden childhood, Anita.
And here it is turning up all unexpected.

07:21.075 --> 07:24.430
Now I can't look a golden childhood
in the mouth, can I?

07:24.474 --> 07:26.510
The commentary, please, Dylan.

07:31.473 --> 07:33.428
Myselves

07:33.472 --> 07:35.702
The grievers grieve among the street

07:35.752 --> 07:38.710
Burned to tireless death

07:38.752 --> 07:40.104
A child of a few hours

07:40.151 --> 07:41.470
With its kneading mouth

07:41.511 --> 07:43.785
Charred on the black breast of the grave

07:43.830 --> 07:45.502
The mother dug

07:45.550 --> 07:47.620
And its arms full of fires.

07:47.670 --> 07:52.106
Spare us the bloody tragedy, man.
I need something hopeful here.

07:54.189 --> 07:56.464
The lion once known as Jehovah

07:56.509 --> 07:59.387
- Oh...
- Rose up and cocked its leg over

07:59.429 --> 08:01.384
The lioness roared,
Jehovah had scored

08:01.428 --> 08:03.020
All over the living room sofa

08:03.068 --> 08:05.217
Dylan, I require a commentary.

08:05.267 --> 08:08.418
Dylan! Dylan!

08:27.023 --> 08:28.422
Caitlin?

08:28.463 --> 08:31.579
- You told me you couldn't live without me.
- Where's our son?

08:31.622 --> 08:35.740
Chopped up in little bits and packed
with my knickers in the suitcase.

08:35.782 --> 08:37.659
The police'll be chasing you.

08:37.702 --> 08:40.455
- Don't pretend you want him here.
- There's bombs!

08:40.501 --> 08:45.052
It's nothing to do with bombs.
You don't want him. So I didn't bring him.

08:46.620 --> 08:50.977
I've never been a father before, Cat.
It's not straightforward.

08:51.020 --> 08:54.170
- Still the light of your life, am I?
- In the New Forest, is he?

08:54.219 --> 08:58.177
Why are you asking, Dullun?
You know damn well our son's with my mother.

08:58.218 --> 09:00.254
I love you, Cat.

09:00.298 --> 09:02.686
Give us a fag, then.

09:02.737 --> 09:06.775
I'm out of bleeding fags.
Give my head a good scratch. Please?

09:09.016 --> 09:10.894
Oh, lovely!

09:10.937 --> 09:12.767
- Where are we living?
- Nowhere.

09:12.816 --> 09:15.967
- Ow! Velvet your bloody claws!
- Scratch your own bloody head!

09:16.016 --> 09:17.414
- Come here.
- No.

09:17.455 --> 09:19.127
Kiss me.

09:30.253 --> 09:33.369
Excuse me.
You dropped your handkerchief.

09:34.732 --> 09:37.325
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did. Right there.

09:38.691 --> 09:40.363
It's not mine, sorry.

09:40.411 --> 09:44.119
You're supposed to take the hankie,
I'm supposed to introduce myself,

09:44.170 --> 09:46.843
- buy you a drink.
- I don't want a drink.

09:49.449 --> 09:52.806
- Nice try, though.
- I've never done this before.

09:52.850 --> 09:56.239
No. You've just never
been caught out before.

10:02.248 --> 10:03.805
Hello, darling.

10:06.327 --> 10:10.478
- Sod you, then!
- Oh, dear. Picky, picky, picky.

10:10.526 --> 10:14.404
- You're late.
- I know. It's all her fault.

10:18.085 --> 10:20.882
- Who's your friend?
- Queen of Ireland,

10:20.924 --> 10:25.678
love of my life, mother of my child,
Caitlin Thomas.

10:27.163 --> 10:28.676
Your wife, Dylan?

10:30.443 --> 10:32.513
The one and only.

10:33.963 --> 10:38.910
- He didn't mention...
- Well, he wouldn't, would he?

10:43.001 --> 10:45.434
You made that, didn't you?

10:47.440 --> 10:49.191
I might like you.

10:49.239 --> 10:51.833
Then again, I might not.

10:52.999 --> 10:55.353
I'll await your decision, shall I?

10:56.238 --> 10:58.706
I won't hold my breath, mind.

11:00.077 --> 11:03.911
- Got a mansion we could share?
- Yes. Two little homeless orphans.

11:03.957 --> 11:08.712
- I've only got a room.
- Bugger. Condemned to her sister's.

11:08.757 --> 11:10.826
I'll be having that, sailor boy.

11:10.876 --> 11:14.266
- Needn't let...
- Small matter of a wife?

11:16.235 --> 11:20.705
- Nothing should ever come between us.
- Oh, God, Dylan.

11:20.754 --> 11:23.143
Soul mates, we are, Vera. Always were.

11:23.194 --> 11:27.027
- Don't.
- Stop talking about me.

11:29.233 --> 11:32.861
There's a phone in the hall
where I stay. You know.

11:34.152 --> 11:37.188
If you want me, he's got my number.

11:41.750 --> 11:43.468
What does it mean when she smiles?

11:45.070 --> 11:47.026
I don't know. Never did.

11:52.549 --> 11:56.223
God help us.
It's the Visigoths from Wales.

11:57.028 --> 11:58.905
Your sister's here.

11:59.828 --> 12:02.660
Back from strangling Germans, then, are you?

12:02.707 --> 12:05.221
Left the other boys playing with their little pistols.

12:05.267 --> 12:08.702
All ging-gang-gooley and yo-ho-ho.

12:08.746 --> 12:11.021
That what you call poetry, is it?

12:11.066 --> 12:14.057
Look, give us a bed
and we'll stay out from under your feet.

12:15.425 --> 12:23.615
# Maybe it's because I kissed you too much

12:26.864 --> 12:34.018
# Maybe that is why
my kiss means too little

12:39.301 --> 12:50.210
# Maybe with a love so great
and a love so small

12:51.619 --> 13:01.936
# Maybe I'll be left with no love at all

13:04.337 --> 13:15.803
# Maybe I'll be left with no love at all #

13:33.412 --> 13:37.768
Sometimes I can nurse a single pint
all night. But that's sometimes.

13:38.770 --> 13:40.442
Thank you.

13:40.690 --> 13:43.603
Oh, yeah! I thought it was hilarious.

13:45.130 --> 13:48.520
I'll get them in.
You pay, though, Vera, eh? Fair dos.

13:48.770 --> 13:51.920
- Support the starving poet.
- You are not a bloody poet, Dylan.

13:51.969 --> 13:55.244
You write films about barrage
sodding balloons for your living.

13:55.288 --> 13:56.767
There is a war on.

13:56.808 --> 13:58.799
You know, you're not the man I married.

13:58.848 --> 14:03.079
I did cartwheels in a rubber corset in Peter
Robinson's window when I was hungry.

14:03.127 --> 14:05.640
You were never hungry.
You've always had a man to feed you.

14:05.686 --> 14:08.883
Demonstration purposes it was.
Bet you can't beat that.

14:08.926 --> 14:10.961
Bet I can't.

14:14.125 --> 14:16.115
He's following me.

14:17.804 --> 14:20.158
Don't you have all the luck!

14:20.203 --> 14:21.522
Watch this.

14:33.162 --> 14:36.438
- Causing chaos, my lovely.
- What do you need knickers for?

14:36.482 --> 14:39.518
Looking for a good time
with a couple of showgirls?

14:42.560 --> 14:44.755
Three more, please.
Your drinks, chaps.

14:44.800 --> 14:49.714
- Chief stag sees off the competition.
- William Killick.

14:53.478 --> 14:56.709
Vera Phillips.
She's very pleased to meet you.

14:56.758 --> 14:59.032
- Rums all round?
- Mmm, goody!

14:59.077 --> 15:00.591
Four rums, please.

15:04.317 --> 15:06.911
- Do you do cartwheels?
- On the seashore I might.

15:06.957 --> 15:09.595
Ah. I'll take you there.

15:10.276 --> 15:13.824
- You're busy, by the looks of you.
- I could do with some sea air.

15:14.475 --> 15:16.352
I'd like to sit on the beach with you.

15:17.155 --> 15:19.145
Don't you know a brush-off
when you get one?

15:19.194 --> 15:21.229
Got any smokes?

15:21.273 --> 15:23.548
I enjoyed your show.

15:23.593 --> 15:25.231
- Did you?
- Yes.

15:27.473 --> 15:29.861
- Hey?
- Hay's for horses.

15:29.912 --> 15:31.629
Come for a gallop.

15:32.951 --> 15:36.182
Used to call it busking,
singing in the tube stations.

15:36.231 --> 15:38.698
Coppers used to move you on.

15:40.111 --> 15:42.021
I'll come again, if I may.

15:43.030 --> 15:44.463
Free world.

16:03.986 --> 16:08.502
Keeping those rums to yourself?
We're in danger of breaking a thirst.

16:08.546 --> 16:11.582
I don't melt at the sight of a uniform, that's all.

16:11.625 --> 16:16.300
- Sod it. I don't like nosy parkers.
- It was a civil question.

16:16.344 --> 16:19.143
I could have said,
"Are you after my husband?" But I didn't.

16:21.584 --> 16:25.098
Heartache, that's what I see in a uniform.

16:25.143 --> 16:27.532
I won't love someone
just to have them die on me.

16:27.583 --> 16:30.733
Who's talking about love?
Don't you ever get lonely?

16:30.782 --> 16:34.091
- My work's all I need.
- I used to think I'd be a dancer.

16:34.141 --> 16:36.177
Danced night and day.

16:38.501 --> 16:41.094
I know, you're one of those.

16:41.140 --> 16:44.370
No. No! God!

16:44.419 --> 16:47.092
Not one of those, for God's sake!
Not that I'm averse.

16:47.139 --> 16:50.449
One of the ones
that never got over her first love.

16:51.458 --> 16:54.017
Course I am.

16:57.218 --> 17:00.016
Didn't your mother
teach you any manners?

17:00.058 --> 17:03.094
- All I said...
- You can walk on your own, I know.

17:03.137 --> 17:05.969
Keep your hand on your ha'penny,
that's what my mother taught me.

17:06.016 --> 17:10.009
- I'm not touching you.
- Well, don't look at me either.

17:10.056 --> 17:11.727
Fine.

17:11.775 --> 17:14.083
No, don't do that!

17:15.454 --> 17:18.412
What have you got against me,
Vera Phillips?

17:19.574 --> 17:21.644
You might be dead tomorrow.

17:21.694 --> 17:24.525
Live while you can, live all you can.

17:26.692 --> 17:30.128
- I won't see you again.
- Of course not.

17:33.411 --> 17:35.480
I'd like my torch back.

17:40.251 --> 17:41.809
Please.

17:51.849 --> 17:54.646
Don't let the light out!

17:54.688 --> 17:57.155
Light of your life.

17:58.887 --> 18:02.197
Has to wipe its feet
before it comes back in again.

18:06.285 --> 18:07.798
No!

18:10.085 --> 18:11.996
Cat! Cat!

18:14.444 --> 18:17.277
Little dog needs the toilet.

18:17.324 --> 18:19.554
Go bark somewhere else.

18:30.162 --> 18:31.675
Come on, Catty.

18:34.881 --> 18:37.440
Have you got a poem for me?

18:37.480 --> 18:40.711
You still owe me for the last one.

18:41.960 --> 18:46.429
I am not a sodding deposit box, Dylan.

18:54.879 --> 18:57.311
What do you think this is?

19:00.597 --> 19:02.827
- It could be a scribble!
- Could be.

19:02.877 --> 19:05.549
- It could be a bloody limerick, Dullun!
- Could be.

19:08.395 --> 19:13.423
Among Those Killed In The Dawn Raid
Was A Man Aged A Hundred.

19:13.475 --> 19:16.272
- Happy piece, is it?
- Do you want to hear it?

19:17.793 --> 19:19.590
Do you?

19:19.633 --> 19:21.703
Do you want to hear it?

19:23.873 --> 19:25.670
Oh, heavy!

19:33.392 --> 19:36.667
When the morning
was waking over the war

19:36.711 --> 19:41.386
He put on his clothes
and stepped out and he died

19:42.550 --> 19:46.861
The locks yawned loose
as a blast blew them wide

19:46.909 --> 19:49.468
He dropped where he loved
on the burst pavement...

19:49.508 --> 19:51.703
- Lived.
- What?

19:51.748 --> 19:54.137
Lived.

19:54.188 --> 19:56.463
Oh, no, it's loved.

19:56.508 --> 19:59.145
You can't read your own bloody writing.
Lived! Lived!

19:59.186 --> 20:01.575
- Loved!
- He's a hundred sodding years old!

20:01.626 --> 20:03.025
He can't remember love.

20:03.066 --> 20:05.341
The bloody word's only
there because I wrote it!

20:05.386 --> 20:07.104
Dropped where he loved

20:07.146 --> 20:09.374
- on the burst pavement stone
- Shh!

20:13.385 --> 20:15.819
It's mine, isn't it?

20:16.905 --> 20:19.019
What you write.

20:19.903 --> 20:22.098
All my words.

20:22.143 --> 20:24.816
And every heartbeat.

20:24.863 --> 20:27.172
They're all for you.

20:27.223 --> 20:28.893
Me?

20:31.141 --> 20:33.291
Come here, then.

20:34.581 --> 20:36.811
Come on, you!

20:41.419 --> 20:47.255
Get out of bed and come and see
what he's done this time!

20:50.097 --> 20:53.215
Oh, dear. Naughty doggy Dylan.

20:53.258 --> 20:55.818
Do you know what that is?

20:55.858 --> 20:59.849
That's animal behaviour, that's what it is.

20:59.896 --> 21:01.966
Nicolette, I'm...

21:02.016 --> 21:05.645
I'm...

21:08.016 --> 21:09.845
Is Vera Phillips there, please?

21:09.894 --> 21:12.169
<i>- Just a moment.
- Thank you.</i>

21:16.294 --> 21:18.125
<i>- Hello?
- Hello, darling.</i>

21:18.174 --> 21:19.970
<i>- Dylan?
- Course it is.</i>

21:22.172 --> 21:25.005
There was a young hero called Killick

21:25.052 --> 21:28.328
Who marched to the top of a... hillick

21:29.133 --> 21:31.691
He stood legs astride
and whipped out his pride

21:31.731 --> 21:34.199
And spread Brylcreem all over his fillick

21:34.251 --> 21:36.207
What's a fillick?

21:36.251 --> 21:39.926
- Showing your ignorance now, Cat.
- William's will be nice, whatever it is.

21:39.971 --> 21:42.278
Not that you're seeing him again.

21:42.329 --> 21:46.117
- He'll still have a nice one.
- Come here, Vera Bera.

21:48.529 --> 21:50.916
Come on. Come and have a cuddle.

21:51.967 --> 21:55.642
Go on, you're welcome to it. I don't want him.

22:03.885 --> 22:06.683
Don't change, Vera Bera.

22:08.486 --> 22:11.601
You're the star in my dark sky.
Don't you ever change.

22:11.644 --> 22:15.717
- What am I in your sky?
- You're on my earth, Caitlin.

22:15.764 --> 22:17.959
Just where I want you to be. Come on.

22:18.004 --> 22:20.199
Come and have a cuddle.

22:29.802 --> 22:32.109
What are you laughing at? What?

22:32.160 --> 22:33.718
What?

22:33.760 --> 22:34.988
What is it?

22:35.040 --> 22:38.510
What? What?

22:50.119 --> 22:52.427
It's like living with children.

22:56.997 --> 22:59.636
- Oh, God!
- I'm going to the pub.

23:05.835 --> 23:07.905
What's it like having a son?

23:07.955 --> 23:09.911
Oh, exhausting.

23:11.715 --> 23:13.704
I can't imagine it.

23:14.713 --> 23:17.910
He's a whole world away from here.

23:18.953 --> 23:22.946
Safe and sound.

23:26.952 --> 23:29.261
You could die in an air raid.

23:29.312 --> 23:31.428
- I'm not going to.
- You might.

23:31.472 --> 23:33.985
This is not
how I would choose to seduce someone.

23:34.030 --> 23:37.340
My firm intention is to live forever.

23:37.390 --> 23:40.223
- Is that a promise?
- Cross my heart.

23:51.588 --> 23:55.499
You only think you're in love with the poet.
You know that, don't you?

23:55.546 --> 23:58.299
His name's Dylan.
You can say Dylan, can't you?

23:58.346 --> 24:01.497
- So, you admit you're in love with him?
- Bloody lawyer, are you?

24:01.546 --> 24:06.096
I'm not saying I'm the better man,
but I'm not married, Vera.

24:06.145 --> 24:09.342
And you'll admit that gives me an advantage.

24:09.385 --> 24:11.057
I'll admit nothing.

24:11.105 --> 24:13.744
On the grounds that it may incriminate you?

24:13.785 --> 24:16.661
You're trying to provoke me, aren't you?

24:19.103 --> 24:22.300
First love's all right as far as it goes.

24:22.343 --> 24:25.731
Last love, that's what I'm interested in.

24:25.781 --> 24:29.296
Oh, you think you're so damn wise.

24:48.738 --> 24:51.206
- What do you want, Vera?
- Oh...

24:51.258 --> 24:55.137
the moon from out of the skies,
the stars in all their glitter.

24:55.178 --> 24:57.326
What else?

24:57.376 --> 25:01.449
It makes you know you're alive, wanting.
That's what I think.

25:01.496 --> 25:03.327
Oh, I'm alive all right.

25:03.376 --> 25:05.332
Every last bit of me.

25:07.814 --> 25:10.203
Oh! Stay there.

25:13.854 --> 25:16.731
- Right, stay still.
- All right!

25:18.732 --> 25:21.530
Still!

25:26.452 --> 25:29.124
- I'm as good as he is.
- Good as who is?

25:29.171 --> 25:31.605
Dylan. The bugger.

25:32.731 --> 25:37.167
He thinks that I am put on this earth
to nurture his talent.

25:37.210 --> 25:42.806
Cook for him, have his children, clean for him.
That's all I'm here for.

25:44.009 --> 25:47.557
Who's nurturing my bloody talent?

25:48.368 --> 25:51.916
- Will William nurture your talent?
- I'll nurture my own.

25:53.487 --> 25:56.524
Cut off his trigger finger, that's what I'd do.

25:56.567 --> 25:59.125
I would, I'd come up quietly in the night

25:59.165 --> 26:03.478
and I'd tie him down and I'd... maim him.

26:12.804 --> 26:16.240
Look at us. How do they live up to us?

26:16.284 --> 26:19.513
They don't, dirty tarts!

26:31.960 --> 26:35.270
- My brother died for the likes of you!
- I didn't bloody ask him to, did I?

26:35.320 --> 26:38.516
Bleeding conchie! Lick my bleeding boot!

26:38.559 --> 26:40.754
Welsh seamen. You can smell them a mile off.

26:41.959 --> 26:44.268
- I ain't got no quarrel with you!
- Damn right!

26:44.319 --> 26:46.435
What are you protecting him for? Scum, he is!

26:46.479 --> 26:50.153
Get back to your drinking. Now. Go on.

26:54.157 --> 26:58.116
He's right, you know.
Contamination, that's what I am.

26:58.157 --> 27:00.226
I'd stay well clear.

27:00.276 --> 27:05.110
No, no, no. I'm just gonna stay down here
a moment. Just... just a little moment.

27:05.155 --> 27:09.511
- You're lying in piss, Dylan.
- I've had worse beds.

27:12.833 --> 27:15.028
I wouldn't like to get
on the wrong side of you.

27:15.073 --> 27:18.702
Well, see you don't, then.

27:18.753 --> 27:20.869
You bloody warriors.

27:20.913 --> 27:24.700
You're a bunch of buggering yes men.
You don't even know what you're fighting for.

27:24.752 --> 27:28.540
- To live without fear, me and mine.
- Ta.

27:35.550 --> 27:37.108
Oh, God!

27:39.230 --> 27:45.064
Terrified, I am, of not... not doing.

27:45.108 --> 27:48.942
War, see, it's useful.
It gives the terror a focus.

27:48.988 --> 27:51.865
Is she in there? Vera?

27:53.786 --> 27:59.339
All you heroes, you think the women just
fall at your feet at the sight of you, don't you?

27:59.387 --> 28:00.785
You think they don't?

28:02.386 --> 28:06.173
Of course, if I could be born again,
I'd have a word with God.

28:06.225 --> 28:10.217
"Make me a hero", I'd say.
This way is far too much bloody hard work.

28:10.264 --> 28:12.573
- Come on.
- What, go on living?

28:13.783 --> 28:16.013
I've a cure for funk.

28:16.063 --> 28:18.577
- Death, that's the only cure.
- Double?

28:18.623 --> 28:20.738
You offering?

28:20.782 --> 28:24.490
# There was a young poet called Dylan

28:24.541 --> 28:29.171
# Who swore that he never would kill 'em

28:29.221 --> 28:34.247
# When called by his country
to serve at the front

28:34.299 --> 28:37.736
# He said he would rather make...

28:37.780 --> 28:40.453
# Fillums! #

28:45.698 --> 28:48.371
<i> Possessed by the skies</i>

28:50.098 --> 28:55.409
<i>And taken by light in her arms
at long and dear last</i>

28:55.456 --> 28:58.368
<i>I may without fail</i>

28:58.416 --> 29:04.684
Suffer the first vision
that set fire to the stars

29:07.054 --> 29:09.363
Touch her and I'll kill you.

29:10.814 --> 29:13.088
Caitlin's territory, is she?

29:16.413 --> 29:18.847
Caitlin's friend.

30:09.964 --> 30:13.717
# Hang out the stars in Indiana

30:14.843 --> 30:18.391
# Up in the sky of midnight blue

30:19.522 --> 30:22.798
# Hang out the stars in Indiana

30:22.842 --> 30:27.675
# To light my way back home to you #

30:27.720 --> 30:29.472
Here.

30:29.520 --> 30:32.557
- I can buy my own drink.
- Just take the bloody thing.

30:32.600 --> 30:36.912
# A melody just meant for two #

30:36.960 --> 30:39.678
- Care to dance?
- I'd love to, thank you.

30:41.439 --> 30:43.509
Don't worry, they won't get us down here.

30:46.638 --> 30:51.233
# How could I find in things I sought for?

30:51.277 --> 30:53.871
# No wonder they were all denied

30:55.796 --> 30:58.185
# The very happiness I fought for #

30:58.236 --> 31:00.544
- My round.
- Don't be childish.

31:00.595 --> 31:04.473
- Gin drinkers, are they, the children you know?
- Dance. Come on.

31:04.514 --> 31:07.551
I'm an independent woman.
I can buy a round if I want to.

31:07.594 --> 31:10.710
- And a fight, you can have that too.
- All right, then.

31:12.234 --> 31:14.145
After a dance.

31:14.194 --> 31:17.583
# Hang out the stars in Indiana

31:17.633 --> 31:21.545
# To light my way back home to you #

31:25.991 --> 31:29.347
- I won't always do as you say.
- Thank you for the warning.

31:29.391 --> 31:33.178
- I won't.
- Just dance.

32:09.344 --> 32:11.459
Where are you? Mary?

32:23.821 --> 32:26.255
Come on!

32:26.301 --> 32:29.098
- This way.
- I need help over here, now.

32:37.019 --> 32:42.251
Vera! Vera. Vera, you can leave her now.

32:42.298 --> 32:45.654
- No, the pavement's wet!
- No, she won't feel it.

32:45.698 --> 32:47.892
Hmm? Leave her now.

32:52.456 --> 32:56.005
Come on. It's all right. It's all right.

32:56.056 --> 32:58.523
It's all right.

32:58.575 --> 33:01.169
Come on. It's all right. It's all right.

33:08.734 --> 33:13.124
# Have every robin sing a love song

33:15.773 --> 33:20.004
# A melody just made for two

33:21.932 --> 33:26.721
# For in my heart there'll be a love song

33:28.570 --> 33:34.166
# A song I long to sing to you #

33:44.367 --> 33:46.835
I bet you lay this on the ground.

33:48.208 --> 33:52.598
- Why would I do that?
- For all the girls.

33:52.647 --> 33:55.114
You won't get me on...

34:00.965 --> 34:03.035
Those people, William.

34:04.884 --> 34:07.557
- Shh.
- All those people.

34:16.002 --> 34:19.630
You've got a raindrop
running down down your cheek.

34:21.281 --> 34:23.351
Just like a tear.

34:31.760 --> 34:33.830
Make love to me.

35:30.070 --> 35:32.902
No harm will ever come to you.

35:32.949 --> 35:36.942
Not from me. Not from anyone else.

35:36.989 --> 35:39.297
Not while I'm here.

35:40.308 --> 35:43.140
No word of mine will ever hurt you.

35:44.468 --> 35:46.743
That sounds like a vow.

36:25.181 --> 36:27.649
A stranger has come

36:27.701 --> 36:30.373
<i>To share my room in the house</i>

36:58.975 --> 37:00.646
<i>A stranger has come</i>

37:00.694 --> 37:03.129
<i>To share my room in the house</i>

37:03.175 --> 37:05.085
<i>Not right in the head</i>

37:06.014 --> 37:08.608
<i>A girl mad as birds</i>

37:08.654 --> 37:10.644
<i>She has come possessed</i>

37:10.693 --> 37:13.650
<i>Who admits the delusive light
through the bouncing wall</i>

37:13.692 --> 37:15.922
<i>Possessed by the skies</i>

37:19.132 --> 37:23.249
<i>And taken by light in her arms
at long and dear last</i>

37:23.291 --> 37:25.884
<i>I may, without fail</i>

37:25.930 --> 37:30.879
Suffer the first vision
that set fire to the stars

37:33.209 --> 37:35.847
I don't like it, Dylan.

37:39.688 --> 37:43.522
I've another couple of lines in my head
I'm not sure where to put.

37:43.568 --> 37:47.526
- It's not finished, then?
- No, strictly speaking.

37:48.927 --> 37:51.805
Don't write poems for me any more?

37:51.847 --> 37:54.962
It's just a phase.

37:57.325 --> 37:59.395
Come here.

38:00.885 --> 38:03.921
Bring that body back to me.

39:02.475 --> 39:04.033
- Oh.
- Now...

39:04.075 --> 39:06.190
Shh!

39:16.352 --> 39:19.548
- It's a marriage licence.
- Special one.

39:19.591 --> 39:21.741
- No.
- What?

39:21.791 --> 39:24.669
You can't make me.
What if I can't love you?

39:24.711 --> 39:28.338
- I've been posted, Vera.
- Well, that's a hell of a proposal.

39:29.829 --> 39:32.263
I... love... you.

39:32.309 --> 39:34.664
I am not marrying you.

39:34.709 --> 39:38.860
- No. You don't make the decisions any more.
- No.

39:38.908 --> 39:40.819
- Say it. Say it.
- Uh-uh. No.

39:40.868 --> 39:43.063
- Say, "I'll marry you."
- No.

39:43.108 --> 39:46.144
Say it. Say yes. Say yes. Yes!

39:46.187 --> 39:49.940
- Yes! Say yes!
- Yes!

39:49.986 --> 39:53.456
- Say yes!
- Oh, for God's sake, say yes!

39:56.665 --> 39:59.576
My first was Augustus John.

39:59.624 --> 40:02.616
Seduced me when I was 15, the old goat.

40:03.584 --> 40:06.336
It doesn't mean anything, fucking. It's not love.

40:06.383 --> 40:08.612
I get an itch, it's gotta be scratched.

40:08.662 --> 40:10.732
I'd do it myself, only I'm too lazy.

40:10.782 --> 40:14.297
Why bother, when you can get
someone else to do it for you?

40:14.342 --> 40:18.380
- Nothing to do with love, fucking?
- Uh-uh. Nothing.

40:20.021 --> 40:25.175
- Who was your first?
- What?

40:25.221 --> 40:28.212
You don't need to tell me. I know it was Dylan.

40:30.299 --> 40:33.371
We were kids. Tents piled in a beach hut.

40:33.419 --> 40:37.048
- Nice and comfy, then.
- We were children, still innocent.

40:37.099 --> 40:39.930
We are still innocent, me and Dylan.

40:41.017 --> 40:43.577
I only want it as a memory. I don't want it back.

40:43.617 --> 40:45.209
Does William know?

40:46.457 --> 40:49.891
Don't ever tell him.
I can forgive the past, he won't.

40:53.735 --> 40:55.488
The past I can forgive.

40:58.775 --> 41:00.730
You warning me?

41:15.092 --> 41:19.369
- You love William, don't you?
- You have to love someone these days.

41:19.411 --> 41:22.004
You sure you want to marry him?

41:24.970 --> 41:30.998
I've never had a best friend before.
Here. See if I look like a mermaid?

41:41.007 --> 41:44.079
We've a couple of cleaners
who'd be pleased to act as witnesses.

41:44.127 --> 41:46.482
They'll be here, they will.

41:48.487 --> 41:51.158
I'm sorry, we've got couples queuing up.

41:51.205 --> 41:53.958
Sorry!

41:54.005 --> 41:57.281
- About bloody time.
- See?

42:00.164 --> 42:03.235
- Look. Bend down, can't you?
- Three guineas that cost.

42:03.283 --> 42:06.400
How many words is that for
a few feathers and a piece of cloth?

42:06.443 --> 42:10.152
- Where did you get three guineas?
- He wrote a cheque. It'll bounce, of course.

42:10.203 --> 42:13.114
You look beautiful!
Tell her she looks beautiful.

42:13.162 --> 42:15.232
She is beautiful. Come on. Let's get married.

42:15.282 --> 42:19.480
- It was Dylan's idea. He chose it.
- You always did have hats.

42:29.240 --> 42:32.196
Would you mind awfully?

42:32.238 --> 42:37.392
I'm terribly sorry. Purely for old times' sake.

42:47.836 --> 42:50.748
- Sorry, old chap.
- Call of duty.

42:50.796 --> 42:52.706
Carry on, Sergeant.

42:57.195 --> 43:00.028
Oh, treat me right, can't you?

43:00.595 --> 43:02.788
Oh, no, no! I want to give a toast.

43:02.833 --> 43:05.301
I'll squeeze the life out of you.

43:05.353 --> 43:06.502
- Yes, after the toast.
- Go on!

43:06.553 --> 43:07.668
You're killing me.

43:07.713 --> 43:11.308
Oh, go on, you great
Welsh bastard, or I'll break you in two!

43:14.271 --> 43:17.308
To all the things that really matter.

43:17.351 --> 43:19.626
- And bugger the ones that don't.
- Hear, hear.

43:19.671 --> 43:21.662
- Can you please get down?
- Sing, and I might.

43:21.711 --> 43:23.142
- Oh, God.
- Sing, Dullun!

43:27.229 --> 43:33.497
# Myfanwy boed yr holl o'th fywyd

43:33.548 --> 43:41.228
# Dan heulwen disglair canol dydd

43:41.268 --> 43:49.139
# Boed i rosyn gwridog iechyd

43:49.186 --> 43:55.373
# I ddawnsio ganmlwydd ar dy rudd #

43:55.424 --> 43:58.097
It's that old heiryth,

43:59.104 --> 44:02.380
that old Welsh thing
they're always banging on about.

44:02.424 --> 44:05.061
He hates the bloody place, doesn't he?

44:06.102 --> 44:07.820
Who doesn't?

44:10.823 --> 44:14.780
But all he wants, see,
he wants back there.

44:15.501 --> 44:17.492
She's no different.

44:18.501 --> 44:22.130
No, you'll never come between them,
not with them being Welsh together.

44:22.181 --> 44:27.128
- Why should I come between them?
- Course, you've always got me.

44:30.659 --> 44:32.331
Perfect.

44:34.338 --> 44:37.807
<i>"For old times' sake."
That's what he said.</i>

44:37.857 --> 44:40.974
<i>- No harm will ever come to you.
- He'll always be my friend.</i>

44:41.017 --> 44:44.804
<i>No word of mine will ever hurt you.
- I can still have friends.</i>

44:51.496 --> 44:54.249
You're crying.

44:54.296 --> 44:56.808
Dreaming, that's all.

44:56.854 --> 44:59.368
- You're shaking.
- It'll pass.

45:00.934 --> 45:04.927
You'll come back to me. I know you will.

45:06.892 --> 45:09.565
Tell me the truth.

45:09.612 --> 45:11.728
You're hurting me.

45:13.292 --> 45:16.124
I want everything to be open between us.

45:17.650 --> 45:20.722
- And fresh and clean.
- Stop it.

45:20.770 --> 45:23.364
You and your friend.

45:23.410 --> 45:25.401
Tell me.

45:27.089 --> 45:29.649
We were kids, William.

45:29.689 --> 45:34.080
We were on a beach
and it happened, once. That's all.

45:36.488 --> 45:38.318
William.

45:39.527 --> 45:41.643
Tell me you love me.

45:43.767 --> 45:46.280
Come back alive and I'll say it.

45:47.406 --> 45:51.364
Come back to me,
I'll say anything you want.

45:51.405 --> 45:53.714
And mean it?

45:54.725 --> 45:57.363
Come back and see.

46:12.242 --> 46:18.873
# Drifting and dreaming

46:20.200 --> 46:26.389
# While shadows fall

46:27.599 --> 46:34.834
# Softly at twilight

46:35.598 --> 46:42.149
# I hear you call

46:43.276 --> 46:50.909
# Love's old sweet story

46:50.955 --> 46:56.746
# Told with your eyes

46:58.674 --> 47:06.751
# Drifting and dreaming

47:06.793 --> 47:12.741
# Sweet paradise #

47:23.510 --> 47:27.389
- Sergeant, get these men off the aircraft, now!
- Everybody off the plane!

47:27.430 --> 47:30.102
<i>"Of course
you told me because I asked.</i>

47:30.149 --> 47:32.218
<i>"I should have bitten out my tongue.</i>

47:33.228 --> 47:36.584
<i>"You're all I love. You're all my need.</i>

47:37.668 --> 47:39.817
<i>"You're what I see in front of me.</i>

47:39.867 --> 47:43.575
<i>" And if I look over my shoulder, there...</i>

47:43.626 --> 47:46.379
<i>"There, I can see your smile.</i>

47:47.066 --> 47:50.182
<i>" All honour I would give up for you.</i>

47:50.225 --> 47:53.614
<i>"I could accept defeat
if you were by my side."</i>

48:06.623 --> 48:09.012
Vera.

48:25.299 --> 48:28.894
- Do you want me to hold your head?
- Christ, no!

48:37.817 --> 48:41.332
Now you'll get fat
and Dylan won't love you any more.

48:41.377 --> 48:45.494
You're a bitch.

48:45.536 --> 48:48.767
It's the past Dylan loves.

48:48.816 --> 48:50.806
And you.

48:51.975 --> 48:53.169
Doesn't love me at all.

48:53.215 --> 48:55.682
When's William get back?

48:57.054 --> 48:59.045
I keep writing. No word.

49:00.893 --> 49:02.929
Think he's dead?

49:04.012 --> 49:06.845
I'm still getting his pay.

49:06.892 --> 49:09.531
Army wouldn't pay a dead man.

49:11.052 --> 49:13.849
You'll have to stop singing.

49:13.891 --> 49:15.562
I'll sing if I want.

49:15.610 --> 49:17.760
They won't let you.

49:17.810 --> 49:20.041
Not pregnant, they won't.

49:20.931 --> 49:24.445
Oh, I can't do this. I can't.

49:24.489 --> 49:26.445
A mother, me? Look at me.

49:26.489 --> 49:28.719
Well, get rid of it, then.

49:30.649 --> 49:33.526
- It's William's.
- Ah.

49:33.568 --> 49:35.956
You love him.

49:36.927 --> 49:40.806
I hate him. Oh, God, I hate him so much.

49:40.847 --> 49:43.155
Look what he's done to me.

49:43.206 --> 49:47.721
Don't laugh. Don't damn well laugh!

49:48.685 --> 49:53.439
- I can't do this alone. I can't.
- I'm here, aren't I?

49:53.484 --> 49:56.600
- Let's go home, Caitlin.
- I don't have a home.

49:56.643 --> 50:00.114
- Wales, Caitlin.
- Are you insane, woman?

50:00.164 --> 50:03.758
- I've got money.
- What, William's pay?

50:06.682 --> 50:09.913
I've savings. Of course I have.

50:12.841 --> 50:15.230
Hold him! Bloody hold him!

50:18.440 --> 50:22.558
- The whole town will hear you!
- Shut your damn mouth!

50:24.799 --> 50:27.551
- You see this here?
- Yes.

50:35.717 --> 50:38.754
Give it here.

50:44.676 --> 50:47.110
- Don't let go!
- It's only a baby.

50:47.156 --> 50:49.510
You scream if you want to, Vera. You hear me?

50:59.393 --> 51:01.748
<i>"Please write to me."</i>

51:03.912 --> 51:07.029
<i> "They tell us what to write
to our boys, so we keep your morale up.</i>

51:07.072 --> 51:12.225
<i>"It's our duty. Damn duty, I say.
I'm no heroine, you see.</i>

51:12.271 --> 51:15.740
<i>"I'm fed up to the back teeth of being on my own.
It's not what I married you for.</i>

51:17.431 --> 51:19.580
<i>"Come home.</i>

51:19.630 --> 51:24.828
<i>"I've got something I might want
to say to you. Remember?</i>

51:24.869 --> 51:27.588
<i>"You do remember, don't you?</i>

51:27.629 --> 51:30.222
<i>"Come home. I want to touch you.</i>

51:30.268 --> 51:33.340
<i>"Where the rain fell on your skin.</i>

51:33.388 --> 51:35.776
<i>"Damn you for making me feel this way.</i>

51:35.827 --> 51:38.500
<i>"Damn you to hell and back.</i>

51:39.866 --> 51:41.982
<i>" And back, William.</i>

51:42.026 --> 51:43.982
<i>"And back."</i>

51:54.024 --> 51:57.903
Down. Down!

51:57.944 --> 52:00.252
Man down!

52:10.941 --> 52:13.011
No, sir.

52:18.060 --> 52:20.334
<i>Forgive us</i>

52:20.379 --> 52:23.849
<i>Forgive us your death
that myselves the believers</i>

52:23.899 --> 52:26.207
<i>May hold it in a great flood</i>

52:26.258 --> 52:28.567
<i>Till the blood shall spurt</i>

52:28.618 --> 52:31.211
<i>And the dust shall sing like a bird</i>

52:32.451 --> 52:37.525
<i>As the grains blow,
as your death grows, through our heart</i>

52:37.571 --> 52:38.720
<i>Crying</i>

52:38.771 --> 52:39.760
<i>Your dying</i>

52:39.811 --> 52:40.800
<i>Cry</i>

52:40.851 --> 52:44.604
<i>Child beyond cockcrow by the fire-dwarfed</i>

52:44.650 --> 52:49.040
<i>Street we chant the flying sea</i>

52:49.089 --> 52:51.556
<i>In the body bereft</i>

53:08.045 --> 53:10.161
Come on. Sleep tight.

53:14.045 --> 53:16.878
- I'm hungry.
- Shh.

53:16.925 --> 53:19.233
Baby is sleeping.

53:28.242 --> 53:32.678
It's bloody freezing! Bloody Wales!

53:36.521 --> 53:39.751
When I was little, my da always
used to warm me like this.

53:39.800 --> 53:42.712
- You loved him?
- Adored him.

53:42.760 --> 53:46.035
- I hated mine.
- You didn't hate him. Not hate.

53:46.079 --> 53:48.387
He was loathsome.

53:48.438 --> 53:52.796
Pity you're not a man.
If you were a man, I'd fancy you.

53:55.838 --> 53:57.715
Don't think I didn't know you were there.

53:57.758 --> 54:00.430
- I didn't.
- I could smell him.

54:00.477 --> 54:04.435
Come here, Dylan. Let Vera smell you,
smell the woman on you.

54:04.476 --> 54:06.944
- Stop it.
- She thinks I should twiddle my thumbs while...

54:06.996 --> 54:10.544
- What? What?
- Don't wake the kids, Dylan.

54:10.595 --> 54:13.553
So where are they, Caitlin, hm?
Where are your little friends?

54:13.595 --> 54:18.110
Come on, boys. Out you come.
Feeding time.

54:18.154 --> 54:21.065
Ow! She's killing me! Vera!

54:21.113 --> 54:23.069
I will kill you! I will!

54:23.113 --> 54:24.909
If I catch you at it again, I will!

54:24.952 --> 54:27.989
Why don't you see to the kids, Caitlin? Go on.

54:30.791 --> 54:33.704
- Why do you do it?
- I don't do anything.

54:35.311 --> 54:39.099
I do it, sleep with other women...

54:39.151 --> 54:41.744
- Hello.
- Morning.

54:41.790 --> 54:45.065
...because I'm a poet, and a poet feeds off life.

54:45.109 --> 54:47.259
What?

54:47.309 --> 54:49.663
Pompous sod, aren't you?

54:49.708 --> 54:52.700
I do it because she does it.

54:52.748 --> 54:55.978
She always has. She can't help herself.

54:56.027 --> 54:58.541
It doesn't mean anything to her.

54:58.587 --> 55:02.374
You don't need William. You've got me.

55:03.546 --> 55:06.013
Nothing but you and me with time on our hands

55:06.065 --> 55:08.625
and each other to spend it with.

55:16.384 --> 55:18.420
Hello, Daisy.

55:23.223 --> 55:26.692
Come back with me. Come on.

55:27.902 --> 55:32.133
I'll take you back to a time
when we were safe.

55:32.181 --> 55:37.208
Where no bombs fell from the sky
and no one died, ever.

55:37.260 --> 55:39.490
You can't go back.

55:42.099 --> 55:44.090
We can.

55:45.179 --> 55:47.646
You and me.

55:47.698 --> 55:49.849
It's not real.

55:50.579 --> 55:52.808
It is if we want it to be.

56:07.655 --> 56:10.123
Pity about the poor bloody husband.

56:10.175 --> 56:13.610
Off bleeding for his country
and paying for the fun back home.

56:16.694 --> 56:18.843
Don't mind if I join you, do you?

56:43.969 --> 56:46.437
Room for a small one?

56:49.088 --> 56:52.796
Ooh, wartime luxury.

57:08.646 --> 57:10.442
You can drop me here.

57:16.564 --> 57:19.283
Cat?
That looks nasty.

57:21.083 --> 57:23.471
Catty, Catty. Cat, Cat, Cat.

57:25.472 --> 57:27.781
Cat, Catty.

57:29.872 --> 57:32.305
God, you're drunk in charge of a bike.

57:32.351 --> 57:35.820
And what are you drunk in charge of?

57:38.270 --> 57:40.465
Am I hurting you?
- You can't hurt her.

57:40.510 --> 57:43.387
She's got skin like a rhinoceros hide.

57:47.629 --> 57:51.416
We're only friends, Dylan and me,
you know that, don't you?

57:52.388 --> 57:57.666
- Don't ever lie to me.
- I won't. Not ever.

57:57.707 --> 58:00.221
Friends don't lie to each other.

58:00.267 --> 58:02.860
Still as you can now.

58:12.224 --> 58:15.056
Tell him to come back, Rowatt.

58:19.423 --> 58:23.620
Tell your daddy to come back to me.

58:23.662 --> 58:25.573
Think he sees it, lovely?

58:25.622 --> 58:27.499
Your daddy?

58:28.462 --> 58:30.692
You think he sees the rain?

58:32.302 --> 58:34.053
Hmm?

58:34.101 --> 58:37.456
Mama, Dada.
- Caitlin, shut it up!

58:37.500 --> 58:41.049
You're its father! Play with him!
That's what he wants.

58:41.100 --> 58:43.852
- I'm writing!
- Damn it!

58:43.899 --> 58:46.412
Daddy! Mummy!

58:46.458 --> 58:48.528
That's my only...

58:48.578 --> 58:50.887
- Dada.
- That's my only draft!

58:50.938 --> 58:54.373
You'll find it in the cesspit, then,
along with my only life!

58:54.417 --> 58:56.168
Cat! Cat!

58:57.896 --> 58:59.966
Cat!

59:33.651 --> 59:36.766
<i>When I was a windy boy and a bit</i>

59:36.809 --> 59:39.642
<i>And the black spit of the chapel fold</i>

59:39.689 --> 59:44.445
<i>Sighed the old ram rod dying of women</i>

59:47.088 --> 59:50.160
<i>I tiptoed shy in the gooseberry wood</i>

59:50.208 --> 59:54.247
<i>The rude owl cried like a telltale tit</i>

59:54.288 --> 59:57.915
<i>I skipped in a blush as the big girls rolled</i>

59:57.966 --> 01:00:01.242
<i>Ninepin down on the donkeys' common</i>

01:00:01.286 --> 01:00:04.722
<i>And on seesaw Sunday nights I wooed</i>

01:00:04.766 --> 01:00:07.642
Whoever I would with my wicked eyes

01:00:07.684 --> 01:00:10.721
The whole of the moon I could love and leave

01:00:10.764 --> 01:00:13.642
For God's sake, don't wake Rowatt.

01:00:13.684 --> 01:00:16.720
All the green leaved
little weddings' wives

01:00:16.763 --> 01:00:21.632
In the coal black bush and let them grieve

01:00:24.803 --> 01:00:26.997
Wash my back for me?

01:00:34.681 --> 01:00:38.115
There is nothing
like a proper sponge.

01:00:42.599 --> 01:00:44.430
Give us a kiss, Vera Phillips.

01:00:44.479 --> 01:00:46.867
- Give us a penny, then.
- I haven't got a penny.

01:00:48.437 --> 01:00:50.871
Like we used to be.

01:00:51.837 --> 01:00:54.271
Little dog says, "Play with me."

01:00:55.157 --> 01:00:58.193
That's all you'll get.

01:00:58.995 --> 01:01:00.987
And don't you wet my jumper.

01:01:01.036 --> 01:01:04.472
- We've had baths together before.
- We were children then.

01:01:04.516 --> 01:01:08.508
- I made love to you on a beach.
- Once. And it was cold.

01:01:09.714 --> 01:01:12.353
- So lonely.
- Not for you.

01:01:12.394 --> 01:01:14.624
- Aching with it, you are.
- No, Dylan.

01:01:14.674 --> 01:01:17.666
- No what?
- Don't make mischief.

01:01:17.713 --> 01:01:19.703
There's no harm in it.

01:01:19.752 --> 01:01:22.903
You're getting me wet.

01:01:24.712 --> 01:01:27.067
Walk away, then.

01:01:27.832 --> 01:01:30.469
Go on, Vera Phillips.

01:01:30.510 --> 01:01:33.661
Hmm? Walk away.

01:01:35.070 --> 01:01:39.109
- You want us all to love you.
- Hmm. So I can love you back.

01:01:45.069 --> 01:01:47.219
All right, then.

01:01:48.629 --> 01:01:50.857
Love me.

01:02:20.503 --> 01:02:23.812
Look at me. I'm soaking!

01:02:23.862 --> 01:02:25.932
Shh!

01:03:40.610 --> 01:03:43.122
Vera!

01:04:35.639 --> 01:04:37.516
Hello.

01:04:49.117 --> 01:04:54.873
- Where have you been?
- Nowhere.

01:04:59.316 --> 01:05:02.547
I'm going to make laver bread. Look.

01:05:05.154 --> 01:05:07.543
No, don't.

01:05:08.994 --> 01:05:11.269
You been crying?

01:05:13.834 --> 01:05:16.300
They're sending William home.

01:05:23.392 --> 01:05:26.985
I've never seen a man love anyone
the way I saw that man love you.

01:05:27.030 --> 01:05:29.590
I'm not that me any more.

01:05:32.791 --> 01:05:34.986
I've got Rowatt.

01:05:37.429 --> 01:05:40.023
Just tell him you love him, Vera.

01:05:41.029 --> 01:05:43.065
What if it's too late?

01:05:44.909 --> 01:05:47.979
It's never too late.

01:05:54.227 --> 01:05:58.901
- It's cold! It's cold!
- Of course it's bloody cold!

01:05:58.945 --> 01:06:00.822
Catty!

01:06:07.104 --> 01:06:09.458
I'm pregnant, you know.

01:06:11.144 --> 01:06:13.260
Oh, God, Cat.

01:06:14.264 --> 01:06:16.334
Whose is it?

01:06:17.143 --> 01:06:19.656
Don't know.

01:06:19.702 --> 01:06:22.819
Can't have it, of course. I won't have it.

01:06:25.902 --> 01:06:28.812
- I need money, Vera.
- Do you know someone?

01:06:30.980 --> 01:06:32.379
- He costs.
- Is he safe?

01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:35.935
Just say if you can't help. I'll do it myself.

01:06:37.819 --> 01:06:39.774
Maybe Wilfred knows how, he's a vet.

01:06:39.818 --> 01:06:43.208
- What did you bother with him for?
- He's no bother.

01:06:44.658 --> 01:06:47.330
Come on, we'll go to the bank.

01:06:59.575 --> 01:07:03.454
I'd tell you you'd get it back
but you wouldn't believe me.

01:07:03.495 --> 01:07:05.884
Treats. Come on.

01:07:26.251 --> 01:07:28.845
<i> It's like I only half remember him.</i>

01:07:28.891 --> 01:07:30.562
<i>Dark.</i>

01:07:30.610 --> 01:07:34.205
Good-looking. Dangerous.

01:07:34.250 --> 01:07:38.209
Can't live on memories, can you?
There's only so many of them.

01:07:38.250 --> 01:07:40.887
Use yourself up living on memories.

01:07:41.768 --> 01:07:44.407
It'd be a better place, a world without men.

01:07:44.448 --> 01:07:50.397
- Possibly.
- Dylan, see, sex for him's a giggle.

01:07:50.447 --> 01:07:54.724
He makes a joke of it, whoever it's with.

01:08:00.085 --> 01:08:02.075
Bet William's romantic.

01:08:05.004 --> 01:08:07.314
I can't remember.

01:08:39.917 --> 01:08:44.115
I'll tell you what I think.
I think your daddy is very lucky.

01:08:45.997 --> 01:08:47.988
Hmm.

01:08:53.395 --> 01:08:55.466
Oh, God, look, Rowatt.

01:08:57.316 --> 01:09:00.035
Who's that funny woman? Who is she?

01:09:11.513 --> 01:09:13.787
William.

01:09:16.152 --> 01:09:17.665
It's me.

01:09:21.310 --> 01:09:23.618
I know.

01:09:28.350 --> 01:09:30.261
Well, then.

01:10:14.303 --> 01:10:16.452
Can't you put him down?

01:10:17.622 --> 01:10:19.852
He'll only cry.

01:10:32.460 --> 01:10:34.654
What's that?

01:10:36.418 --> 01:10:39.728
It's a collage. For you.

01:10:55.096 --> 01:10:57.655
Hold me, William.

01:10:59.535 --> 01:11:02.811
- I should deal with the post.
- Let them wait.

01:11:29.770 --> 01:11:33.206
<i>In my craft or sullen art</i>

01:11:33.250 --> 01:11:36.127
<i>Exercised in the still night</i>

01:11:36.169 --> 01:11:38.636
<i>When only the moon rages</i>

01:11:38.688 --> 01:11:40.883
<i>- And the lovers lie abed
- William?</i>

01:11:40.928 --> 01:11:44.966
<i>With all their griefs in their arms</i>

01:11:45.007 --> 01:11:47.726
<i>I labour by singing light</i>

01:11:47.767 --> 01:11:50.599
<i>Not for ambition nor bread</i>

01:11:50.646 --> 01:11:55.799
<i>Or the strut and trade of charms
on the ivory stages</i>

01:11:55.845 --> 01:12:02.114
<i>But for the common wages
of their most secret heart</i>

01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:30.155
You all right?

01:12:30.999 --> 01:12:34.753
- Are you?
- I will be.

01:12:34.799 --> 01:12:37.187
Will you?

01:12:38.238 --> 01:12:42.026
- I don't know where he is.
- Give him time.

01:12:42.078 --> 01:12:46.468
- He's changed.
- So have you.

01:12:46.517 --> 01:12:48.906
He doesn't love me any more.

01:12:48.957 --> 01:12:53.427
Everybody loves you.
And Dylan. Everybody loves him.

01:12:57.875 --> 01:13:00.389
Oh, God!

01:13:00.435 --> 01:13:02.743
Oh, Catty.

01:13:05.634 --> 01:13:07.624
Does it hurt?

01:13:08.713 --> 01:13:11.863
I didn't think it would mean anything.

01:13:12.832 --> 01:13:15.346
Course, it's a relief.

01:13:19.312 --> 01:13:21.506
I'll stop.

01:13:23.591 --> 01:13:26.059
In a minute I will.

01:13:31.150 --> 01:13:35.062
There, see? Happy Caitlin.

01:13:45.827 --> 01:13:49.819
<i># Whistling a tune all the live long day</i>

01:13:49.866 --> 01:13:52.254

01:13:52.305 --> 01:13:54.500
<i># I can truthfully say</i>

01:13:54.545 --> 01:13:57.299
<i># I've got a feeling about her</i>

01:13:57.346 --> 01:13:59.939

01:14:05.304 --> 01:14:07.295
<i># All my troubles are mended</i>

01:14:07.344 --> 01:14:09.538

<i># Cos she's got me walking

01:14:15.142 --> 01:14:16.780
Sorry, I...

01:14:26.580 --> 01:14:31.607
I'm sorry. I can't remember when I last...

01:14:35.499 --> 01:14:37.729
<i># I've got a feeling I've found her</i>

01:14:37.779 --> 01:14:41.054
<i># It was something she said #</i>

01:14:41.098 --> 01:14:43.214
Shall we have some tea?

01:14:43.258 --> 01:14:45.532
<i># And my hat's on the side of my head</i>

01:14:45.577 --> 01:14:48.330

<i>He'll always be my friend, Dylan.</i>

01:15:29.050 --> 01:15:32.121
It's a fox. It's a fox, that's all.

01:15:39.968 --> 01:15:42.356
What's wrong, William?

01:15:42.407 --> 01:15:45.160
Talk to me.

01:15:45.207 --> 01:15:47.879
Please.

01:15:56.206 --> 01:16:00.278
# Bye baby bunting

01:16:01.404 --> 01:16:05.397

<i># Gone to get a rabbit skin</i>

01:16:10.803 --> 01:16:15.751
# To wrap his baby bunting in #

01:17:03.473 --> 01:17:05.907
What did you want me for?

01:17:05.953 --> 01:17:10.343
Was it the money? Was that it? Was that all?

01:17:10.392 --> 01:17:12.986
Don't... don't wake Rowatt.

01:17:14.072 --> 01:17:18.429
My money to keep your tame poet.

01:17:18.472 --> 01:17:24.386
- Oh, I had better offers. Richer offers.
- You? Have you looked at yourself?

01:17:28.030 --> 01:17:31.180
They're my friends. I bought them food.

01:17:31.229 --> 01:17:34.937
- You have to feed people.
- I've nothing left.

01:17:36.348 --> 01:17:37.747
You've got Rowatt!

01:17:37.788 --> 01:17:41.746
At least look at him, William!
Why can't you hold him?

01:17:41.787 --> 01:17:44.095
Is he Dylan's?

01:17:44.146 --> 01:17:48.105
That's what they're saying out there, Vera.
"He's Dylan's child."

01:17:50.986 --> 01:17:52.863
I love you.

01:17:52.906 --> 01:17:54.463
When did that happen?

01:17:54.505 --> 01:17:58.054
I said come back and I'd say it. I said!

01:18:00.424 --> 01:18:03.257
You've been with him.

01:18:04.143 --> 01:18:06.293
Haven't you?

01:18:11.222 --> 01:18:14.611
Hey!

01:18:14.661 --> 01:18:16.617
Hey.

01:18:16.661 --> 01:18:22.656
Hey. Hey.

01:18:22.700 --> 01:18:25.771
- What do they want, blood?
- A finished script.

01:18:25.819 --> 01:18:28.253
- You've been paid for it!
- Yes, but not enough.

01:18:28.299 --> 01:18:30.416
- Be that as it may...
- It's like doing my homework.

01:18:30.460 --> 01:18:32.654
It's not even broken down into scenes yet.

01:18:32.699 --> 01:18:36.452
- I'm not a secretary, Anita!
- Well, I'm not a bloody writer!

01:19:19.651 --> 01:19:22.848
- I'm looking for Dylan Thomas.
- On the house, Captain Killick.

01:19:24.330 --> 01:19:28.527
- Ah, yes, the returning hero.
- There'll be another when you've finished.

01:19:28.569 --> 01:19:31.367
The least we can do.

01:19:34.648 --> 01:19:36.558
Where is he?

01:19:36.607 --> 01:19:39.405
There it is. Waiting for you, see?

01:19:39.447 --> 01:19:42.007
It's the spectre of communism.

01:19:42.047 --> 01:19:44.241
That's what frightens them, the Allies.

01:19:44.286 --> 01:19:47.676
- Two pints of bitter and a gin and tonic.
- Make mine brains.

01:19:47.726 --> 01:19:50.001
Greece. Now, Greece.

01:19:50.046 --> 01:19:53.356
It's the communist partisans that risk their lives

01:19:53.406 --> 01:19:55.521
to fight the Germans, not the British Tommy.

01:19:55.565 --> 01:19:59.523
What they're aiming for, secretly, the Allies,

01:19:59.564 --> 01:20:02.522
is for the Germans to wipe out the partisans,

01:20:02.564 --> 01:20:04.599
wipe out the communists,

01:20:04.643 --> 01:20:08.555
so they won't have to deal with them
after the war.

01:20:11.202 --> 01:20:13.670
You listen to me.

01:20:13.722 --> 01:20:17.872
I held a boy while my sergeant
hacked his arm off.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:22.993
Later I held him while he died.
British boy, he was.

01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:24.792
That was in Greece.

01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:30.471
- I beg your pardon?
- We fight! Out there.

01:20:30.519 --> 01:20:36.150
So you and your friends can sit around
in Hampstead and theorise.

01:20:36.198 --> 01:20:39.553
You do that while we bleed our lives away.

01:20:40.517 --> 01:20:42.951
What do you know about war?

01:20:45.157 --> 01:20:48.465
You people,
what do you know about war, hmm?

01:20:53.075 --> 01:20:56.271
Drink up, boys and girls, drink up.

01:20:56.314 --> 01:20:58.907
Introduce me
to your knowledgeable friends, Dylan.

01:20:58.953 --> 01:21:02.912
- Please, introduce me. I'd be charmed.
- I will as soon as you calm down.

01:21:02.953 --> 01:21:05.104
Oh, you can take my money.

01:21:05.154 --> 01:21:09.668
Hmm? You can take my bloody money
but you can't even introduce me to your friends?

01:21:10.952 --> 01:21:13.147
I'm just a bloody Tommy.

01:21:13.192 --> 01:21:15.308
Time, gentlemen!

01:21:15.352 --> 01:21:17.740
Gentlemen, please. It's time.

01:21:17.791 --> 01:21:19.508
- Whisky, double.
- Time's called.

01:21:19.550 --> 01:21:21.063
Are you refusing to serve me?

01:21:21.110 --> 01:21:23.419
- I said time's called.
- What do you mean, time?

01:21:23.470 --> 01:21:26.030
Go home, Captain Killick.

01:21:27.829 --> 01:21:30.900
No, don't you laugh at me.

01:21:30.948 --> 01:21:33.143
Oh, play the big man.

01:21:33.188 --> 01:21:36.817
Come on.
Easy in front of a woman, isn't it?

01:21:36.868 --> 01:21:41.223
We only have your word for it
that you weren't skulking at the back...

01:21:41.266 --> 01:21:43.303
... with urine running down your leg.

01:21:49.226 --> 01:21:50.863
William, come on.

01:21:50.905 --> 01:21:53.544
Don't bother with them, Captain Killick.

01:21:54.785 --> 01:21:57.174
Best off home.

01:22:19.460 --> 01:22:22.577
- William? What in heaven's name...
- Take your hands off me.

01:22:22.620 --> 01:22:25.259
- Put it down!
- Please! Take your hands off.

01:22:25.300 --> 01:22:27.052
- Put the damn thing down!
- Vera!

01:22:29.819 --> 01:22:32.332
Vera? Vera?

01:22:44.616 --> 01:22:48.404
Give me words... and I'm a giant.

01:22:49.496 --> 01:22:52.691
Above all women. Hmm? Words.

01:22:52.734 --> 01:22:54.611
Beyond the bottle.

01:22:54.654 --> 01:22:56.884
More than love. Better than sex.

01:22:57.894 --> 01:22:59.646
Words... for me.

01:22:59.694 --> 01:23:02.366
<i>- Hmm?
- # Shout, shout, shout for happiness! #</i>

01:23:06.293 --> 01:23:10.081
... tell you about our first night together
at the Wheatsheaf?

01:23:10.133 --> 01:23:13.646
She offered her honour
so I honoured her offer!

01:23:13.691 --> 01:23:16.569
I've still got her on offer.

01:23:16.611 --> 01:23:18.249
Very easily entertained, this one.

01:23:18.291 --> 01:23:21.009
Thinks a pint of Guinness with a potato in it
is a cocktail.

01:23:21.050 --> 01:23:23.517
Don't you, my darling?

01:23:30.489 --> 01:23:32.284
William, no!

01:23:32.327 --> 01:23:33.555
No! No!

01:23:40.368 --> 01:23:41.766
No.

01:23:43.686 --> 01:23:44.835
No! No! No!

01:23:44.886 --> 01:23:46.365
- No! No!
- William!

01:23:46.406 --> 01:23:48.442
William, stop, please!

01:23:48.486 --> 01:23:50.044
Please stop!

01:23:52.524 --> 01:23:55.914
No one here means you any harm. Please.

01:23:57.364 --> 01:23:59.832
Don't you care?

01:23:59.884 --> 01:24:03.238
Your husband and my wife.

01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:16.115
My son.

01:24:28.119 --> 01:24:30.474
You've got a bruise.

01:24:30.519 --> 01:24:32.987
Take me home.

01:24:33.039 --> 01:24:35.267
Did I do that?

01:24:37.757 --> 01:24:41.067
Take her home, William.

01:24:42.437 --> 01:24:44.869
Not without my gun.

01:24:46.355 --> 01:24:51.827
Give me the gun. Or I'll pull the pin
on this and kill the lot of us.

01:24:53.155 --> 01:24:55.223
My son.

01:25:00.554 --> 01:25:03.512
What'd you give it to her for, you daft sod?

01:25:06.712 --> 01:25:08.464
There isn't a pin in it, William.

01:25:10.792 --> 01:25:12.942
Either it's faulty or...

01:25:12.992 --> 01:25:16.699
it's just gone off and we're
standing here dead looking at it.

01:25:27.028 --> 01:25:28.746
Look, the boy's screaming.

01:25:37.787 --> 01:25:40.347
Come home, William.

01:25:40.387 --> 01:25:42.457
William.

01:26:09.061 --> 01:26:13.976
All they care about
is keeping the lid on it, but...

01:26:14.021 --> 01:26:16.376
that's Wales for you.

01:26:16.421 --> 01:26:18.650
Doesn't want the world
knowing its business.

01:26:18.700 --> 01:26:20.577
We could have been killed!

01:26:21.940 --> 01:26:23.498
Cat.

01:26:23.540 --> 01:26:25.815
I haven't got any more money.

01:26:29.818 --> 01:26:32.776
I've nothing left, Dylan.

01:27:19.609 --> 01:27:23.841
Got your toe. Got your toe!

01:27:46.766 --> 01:27:49.597
- Can I...
- Hold him, then.

01:27:59.003 --> 01:28:00.720
See?

01:28:03.362 --> 01:28:06.035
You won't hurt him.

01:28:13.081 --> 01:28:15.117
Thank you.

01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:21.949
Shall we take him out?

01:28:23.959 --> 01:28:26.348
Now.

01:28:39.956 --> 01:28:42.344
You're an expert.

01:28:45.515 --> 01:28:49.712
Eyelashes like feathers. Like yours.

01:28:51.515 --> 01:28:54.665
Captain Killick, it's the police. Open up.

01:28:54.714 --> 01:28:56.864
Oh, God.

01:28:56.914 --> 01:28:59.382
- One way to get rid of me, eh?
- William.

01:29:01.193 --> 01:29:03.581
I love you.

01:29:06.872 --> 01:29:09.067
Come here.

01:29:51.065 --> 01:29:55.614
Don't think I don't understand.
His kind of violence, I mean.

01:29:56.503 --> 01:29:57.572
I do.

01:29:57.623 --> 01:30:00.615
It's just I've never had a Sten gun handy.

01:30:02.342 --> 01:30:04.377
Tea's got scum on it.

01:30:11.861 --> 01:30:15.216
Does William think he's Dylan's?

01:30:17.580 --> 01:30:21.289
- Is he Dylan's?
- No.

01:30:30.978 --> 01:30:32.808
Were you sleeping with him?

01:30:34.777 --> 01:30:36.767
I love my husband.

01:30:43.015 --> 01:30:45.528
I should kill you.

01:30:46.774 --> 01:30:48.970
You're my friend.

01:30:49.975 --> 01:30:52.852
For lying, I mean.

01:30:57.333 --> 01:31:00.882
For lying to me... Vera.

01:31:26.888 --> 01:31:29.448
You look smart. Quite your old self.

01:31:38.806 --> 01:31:41.240
The walls being made
of wood and asbestos,

01:31:41.286 --> 01:31:44.357
the bullets had penetrated through
to the living room,

01:31:44.405 --> 01:31:48.192
where I also found
five more empty bullet cases.

01:31:52.044 --> 01:31:55.877
- At Captain Killick's bungalow...
- I'm the bard. They've just met him.

01:31:55.923 --> 01:31:57.117
Shh.

01:31:57.163 --> 01:32:02.077
...a revolver, a grenade, and 100 rounds
of nine-millimetre ammunition.

01:32:09.081 --> 01:32:13.472
When he left an area, he used
to dig up the mines he'd laid.

01:32:14.960 --> 01:32:17.235
Why don't you take the witness box

01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:19.315
and sing Killick's praises to his judgeship?

01:32:19.359 --> 01:32:21.748
- Why don't you do that?
- Everybody loves a hero.

01:32:21.799 --> 01:32:25.393
Are you telling me Killick didn't know
he had to hand in his weapons?

01:32:25.438 --> 01:32:27.998
Captain William Killick is an expert marksman.

01:32:28.038 --> 01:32:30.676
If he'd been intent on murder,
he couldn't have failed.

01:32:30.717 --> 01:32:34.630
I'd be obliged if you just answer
the questions I ask, Lieutenant Colonel.

01:32:34.677 --> 01:32:37.190
<i>Scratch my head, Cat.</i>

01:32:37.236 --> 01:32:38.987
Can't.

01:32:47.795 --> 01:32:50.024
Is there any reason

01:32:50.074 --> 01:32:54.386
why a man of your rank
should strike a woman in the face?

01:32:54.434 --> 01:32:55.866
No, sir.

01:32:55.913 --> 01:32:58.985
Why did you go
to the Thomas bungalow so late at night?

01:32:59.033 --> 01:33:02.866
I have no idea why. They cut me dead.

01:33:04.272 --> 01:33:07.547
I suppose they didn't want to see
the goose that laid the golden egg.

01:33:08.871 --> 01:33:11.668
I thought I'd show them that war is real.

01:33:11.710 --> 01:33:16.942
I could see there was no one in my line of fire,
so I fired at a partition.

01:33:16.989 --> 01:33:19.628
I never imagined the bullets
would penetrate the wall.

01:33:19.669 --> 01:33:23.059
- The walls were asbestos, Captain Killick.
- I didn't know that.

01:33:23.109 --> 01:33:25.418
I wanted to frighten them, that's all.

01:33:25.469 --> 01:33:27.459
There was a child present.

01:33:29.708 --> 01:33:32.744
Is... is that a question, sir?

01:33:43.585 --> 01:33:46.053
I can't live without him.

01:33:48.024 --> 01:33:52.414
Did you know the entire unit
were killed when they went back out there?

01:33:53.583 --> 01:33:57.370
Wiped out. That would have been him.

01:33:58.542 --> 01:34:00.817
I'm begging you to help him.

01:34:00.862 --> 01:34:03.899
It saved his life, this trial.

01:34:03.942 --> 01:34:06.217
Did him a favour.

01:34:08.701 --> 01:34:12.329
Dylan... please.

01:34:26.258 --> 01:34:28.896
You were the star in my sky.

01:34:30.697 --> 01:34:35.611
- You can't stay the same all your life.
- I can.

01:34:39.015 --> 01:34:41.576
You'll help him, won't you?

01:34:43.135 --> 01:34:45.603
It means that much to you?

01:34:45.655 --> 01:34:47.930
William's my world.

01:34:49.614 --> 01:34:52.253
Him and Rowatt.

01:34:52.294 --> 01:34:54.648
I've no room for anyone else.

01:34:54.693 --> 01:34:59.004
I don't want... anyone else.

01:35:05.971 --> 01:35:07.882
I see.

01:35:09.130 --> 01:35:11.360
I do, I see.

01:35:18.809 --> 01:35:20.561
<i> Mr Thomas?</i>

01:35:33.927 --> 01:35:39.444
Captain Killick and I were...
no more than acquaintances.

01:35:39.486 --> 01:35:42.443
We would occasionally stand
next to each other at the bar.

01:35:42.485 --> 01:35:46.523
Captain Killick was stone-cold sober
on the night of the shooting

01:35:47.204 --> 01:35:50.673
and it is my firm belief that he tried to kill me,

01:35:50.723 --> 01:35:54.318
that he tried to kill my wife,
and that he tried to kill my son.

01:36:01.282 --> 01:36:03.034
<i> Why?</i>

01:36:03.762 --> 01:36:05.797
You.

01:36:08.041 --> 01:36:10.838
Leave Caitlin.

01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:14.589
Go on. Leave Caitlin.

01:36:16.239 --> 01:36:19.231
You've got rid of the opposition.
Now you come on.

01:36:20.399 --> 01:36:23.470
Leave your wife and live with me.

01:36:28.717 --> 01:36:30.833
Do you see?

01:36:33.876 --> 01:36:37.630
You want a 15-year-old girl back on the beach.

01:36:39.036 --> 01:36:40.708
Not me.

01:36:43.315 --> 01:36:46.193
You don't even see me, do you?

01:36:46.235 --> 01:36:48.384
Dylan!

01:36:51.034 --> 01:36:56.107
All you've got is stories in your head. Words.

01:36:56.153 --> 01:36:58.950
And I have to be real.

01:37:00.512 --> 01:37:05.301
William... makes me real.

01:37:12.109 --> 01:37:15.101
If you have sent
my beloved husband to jail...

01:37:17.750 --> 01:37:20.468
I will never forgive you.

01:37:41.665 --> 01:37:45.452
It is my opinion that it is not
an innocent hand that wields a gun

01:37:45.504 --> 01:37:48.382
against a civilian household.

01:37:49.223 --> 01:37:53.738
It is, however, your peers who judge you,
Captain Killick, and not I.

01:37:53.782 --> 01:37:58.015
They have found that there is no evidence
to support the charge of attempted murder.

01:37:59.422 --> 01:38:04.256
I have, therefore, no choice
but to pronounce you free to go.

01:40:15.119 --> 01:40:17.313
There's that smile.

01:40:19.278 --> 01:40:21.348
I never meant to hurt you.

01:40:22.798 --> 01:40:24.947
Might as well, I suppose.

01:40:26.077 --> 01:40:28.146
Smile, I mean.

01:40:30.117 --> 01:40:32.756
Write, Catty.

01:40:32.797 --> 01:40:36.391
- I'll leave that to Dylan.
- Write to me.

01:40:49.113 --> 01:40:51.707
Don't be lonely.

01:40:55.992 --> 01:40:58.459
Don't you, Catty.

01:41:02.191 --> 01:41:04.102
Don't you.

01:41:19.388 --> 01:41:21.902
<i> Not for the proud man apart</i>

01:41:21.948 --> 01:41:24.416
<i>From the raging moon I write</i>

01:41:24.468 --> 01:41:26.935
<i>On these spindrift pages</i>

01:41:26.987 --> 01:41:28.977
<i>Nor for the towering dead</i>

01:41:29.026 --> 01:41:32.177
<i>With their nightingales and psalms</i>

01:41:33.266 --> 01:41:37.144
<i>But for the lovers, their arms</i>

01:41:37.185 --> 01:41:39.573
<i>Round the griefs of the ages</i>

01:42:03.781 --> 01:42:08.854
<i># Was it a marriage made in heaven?</i>

01:42:10.379 --> 01:42:15.453
<i># Was it a gift from God above?</i>

01:42:17.659 --> 01:42:24.096
<i># Do you believe the things you told me?</i>

01:42:24.977 --> 01:42:30.892
<i># Or was it simply careless love?</i>

01:42:32.576 --> 01:42:38.367
<i># You told me once when we were dreaming</i>

01:42:39.615 --> 01:42:45.689
<i># Through life together we would walk</i>

01:42:46.974 --> 01:42:53.366
<i># Those words of love seemed set in starlight</i>

01:42:54.452 --> 01:43:01.561
<i># But now it seems like careless talk</i>

01:43:01.610 --> 01:43:07.368
<i># All your lies are jolly melancholy</i>

01:43:09.211 --> 01:43:14.488
<i># Your eyes were always slightly sad</i>

01:43:16.769 --> 01:43:22.922
<i># But now you're always saying sorry</i>

01:43:23.927 --> 01:43:32.321
