WEBVTT

00:01.667 --> 00:04.208
[dramatic music]

00:10.625 --> 00:14.292
Please. If I can just..

00:14.375 --> 00:16.750
- If I can just finish!
- 'No!'

00:18.000 --> 00:19.583
We have before us
an opportunity

00:19.667 --> 00:23.125
to strike at our mutual enemy,
The Shadows.

00:23.208 --> 00:24.917
If our information is correct

00:25.000 --> 00:26.625
this could be
the biggest engagement

00:26.708 --> 00:28.542
of the war to date.

00:28.625 --> 00:30.917
We do not know how many
of their ships will be involved

00:31.000 --> 00:34.625
so our only chance is to have
as many as possible on our side.

00:34.708 --> 00:36.583
We need all of you
to cooperate.

00:36.667 --> 00:40.500
If you wish cooperation
then why do you not tell us

00:40.583 --> 00:42.625
what the mission is?

00:42.708 --> 00:44.042
- Right!
- I agree with you.

00:44.125 --> 00:46.500
If we discuss this openly

00:46.583 --> 00:49.458
there is every chance that the
enemy will learn of our plans.

00:49.542 --> 00:50.958
You must trust us.

00:51.042 --> 00:53.958
How can we trust you
when you will not trust us?

00:54.042 --> 00:57.458
Because so far we have kept
every promise we've made.

00:57.542 --> 00:58.958
We told you that telepaths

00:59.042 --> 01:01.083
could be used to slow
the advance of the Shadows.

01:01.167 --> 01:03.792
We supplied you with telepaths
if you didn't have your own.

01:03.875 --> 01:07.708
We have saved the lives
of many of your people.

01:07.792 --> 01:11.792
If we haven't earned your trust
by now...then please go.

01:11.875 --> 01:14.500
'Nothing more will be
required of you.'

01:22.708 --> 01:27.625
Ambassador Delenn, if we give
you all the ships you ask for

01:27.708 --> 01:31.000
it will weaken our defenses
around homeworld.

01:31.083 --> 01:34.917
I know it's a risk,
but it's necessary.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.458
The ships will gather
in a holding area in hyperspace

01:37.542 --> 01:40.750
approximately two hours
from their final destination.

01:40.833 --> 01:43.583
They will stand by
until the signal is given.

01:43.667 --> 01:46.875
Then, and only then, will their
destination be revealed.

01:46.958 --> 01:50.958
bring
to this engagement?

01:51.042 --> 01:54.125
As many Minbari cruisers
as can be spared.

01:54.208 --> 01:58.375
And some additional forces
you have not yet seen.

01:58.458 --> 02:01.667
Let us know when you've
finished your deliberations.

02:01.750 --> 02:03.333
But do not take too long.

02:03.417 --> 02:05.125
Our time is short

02:05.208 --> 02:06.792
and growing shorter.

02:08.500 --> 02:10.583
[indistinct chattering]

02:12.750 --> 02:15.292
(John)
'So we don't have
a lot of time.'

02:15.375 --> 02:18.292
The Shadows have been driving
refugees and support ships

02:18.375 --> 02:21.708
into Sector 83
for two months now.

02:21.792 --> 02:23.167
My guess is when
enough of these ships

02:23.250 --> 02:24.458
are gathered at one place

02:24.542 --> 02:27.250
the enemy will hit them
and hit them hard.

02:27.333 --> 02:29.250
Which would demoralize
all sides.

02:29.333 --> 02:30.542
(John)
'Exactly.'

02:30.625 --> 02:33.083
The number of refugees
escaping into Sector 83

02:33.167 --> 02:36.417
has dropped off considerably
for the past few days.

02:36.500 --> 02:38.542
So they may strike
anytime now.

02:38.625 --> 02:41.417
That anytime now
could be today, tomorrow

02:41.500 --> 02:42.875
a few days from now.

02:42.958 --> 02:44.417
If we wait until we hear
about an attack

02:44.500 --> 02:46.292
it'll be too late
to strike back.

02:46.375 --> 02:48.250
They'll be long gone
by the time we get there.

02:48.333 --> 02:51.125
Hmm. Delenn is working
out that part right now.

02:51.208 --> 02:52.417
We'll have
as many ships as we can

02:52.500 --> 02:54.708
standing by in hyperspace.

02:54.792 --> 02:56.792
But for this to work..

02:56.875 --> 03:00.458
...we have to know
the second the enemy shows up.

03:00.542 --> 03:02.458
That means
having an advance scout

03:02.542 --> 03:05.083
on patrol in that area.
One ship.

03:05.167 --> 03:06.333
Any more would draw attention

03:06.417 --> 03:08.042
and they might
change their plans.

03:09.125 --> 03:11.125
And that ship?

03:11.208 --> 03:12.250
That would be us?

03:12.333 --> 03:14.125
'Correct.'

03:14.208 --> 03:17.583
You are to enter Sector 83
and maintain radio silence

03:17.667 --> 03:19.500
until the enemy
comes out of hyperspace.

03:20.750 --> 03:23.000
Now, they may come out
all at once

03:23.083 --> 03:24.542
or in small groups.

03:24.625 --> 03:26.750
Either way,
as soon as you see them

03:26.833 --> 03:29.500
notify the fleet
and get the hell out of there.

03:30.958 --> 03:35.333
You are not, repeat,
not to engage their forces

03:35.417 --> 03:36.958
unless fired upon first.

03:37.042 --> 03:40.167
Now, if that should happen,
do what you have to do

03:40.250 --> 03:42.375
but get out fast.

03:42.458 --> 03:43.667
Understood.

03:43.750 --> 03:44.750
Anything else?

03:44.833 --> 03:46.333
'Yes.'

03:46.417 --> 03:48.500
We've all seen how fast
those ships can move.

03:49.708 --> 03:51.708
If they see you
before you can escape..

03:54.500 --> 03:55.625
'...you'll take the White Star.'

03:55.708 --> 03:57.458
'It's the fastest ship
we've got.'

03:57.542 --> 03:58.625
You'll need it.

03:59.875 --> 04:01.625
'Cause even
if everything goes right

04:01.708 --> 04:04.417
our best guess is
you've only got a 50-50 chance

04:04.500 --> 04:06.208
of getting back alive.

04:12.542 --> 04:17.042
(Ivanova)
The Babylon project was our
last best hope for peace.

04:20.792 --> 04:22.125
It failed.

04:22.208 --> 04:25.042
[intense music]

04:37.583 --> 04:39.250
But in the year
of the Shadow War

04:39.333 --> 04:41.750
it became something greater

04:41.833 --> 04:44.625
our last best hope
for victory.

04:49.583 --> 04:52.000
The year is 2260.

04:52.083 --> 04:54.750
The place Babylon 5.

04:57.583 --> 05:00.625
[theme music]

05:24.625 --> 05:27.708
[music continues]

05:56.708 --> 05:59.250
The others have gone to speak
with their governments.

05:59.333 --> 06:02.417
They have authorized me
to speak in their place.

06:05.208 --> 06:08.792
You will have all the ships
we can spare, Delenn.

06:08.875 --> 06:10.458
I only hope
that you are right

06:10.542 --> 06:14.125
because it will cost us
greatly if you are wrong.

06:23.417 --> 06:25.500
I've got Commander Ivanova
on channel 4.

06:27.042 --> 06:28.250
Put her through.

06:28.333 --> 06:29.958
(Ivanova)
'We're ready to go, captain.'

06:30.042 --> 06:32.167
Any last minute instructions?

06:32.250 --> 06:34.292
Aside from an old
Egyptian blessing

06:34.375 --> 06:36.792
I can't think of a thing.

06:36.875 --> 06:40.125
Then we'll see you
when we see you.

06:40.208 --> 06:42.917
- Full ahead.
Fayzen shok.

06:46.292 --> 06:49.333
[intense music]

06:52.875 --> 06:54.542
An old Egyptian blessing?

06:56.125 --> 06:59.125
"May God stand
between you and harm.

06:59.208 --> 07:01.708
In all the empty places
where you must walk."

07:14.250 --> 07:16.083
Hey, chief.
I'm gonna get some lunch.

07:16.167 --> 07:17.375
- You wanna come along?
- No.

07:17.458 --> 07:18.958
I gotta get back to the office.

07:19.042 --> 07:21.833
You sure? I can bring you back
something. Some small sandwich--

07:21.917 --> 07:24.708
No, thanks. I'm fine.

07:24.792 --> 07:27.000
Anything wrong, chief?

07:27.083 --> 07:28.833
I don't know. Have you seen

07:28.917 --> 07:30.625
or heard anything
about Stephen lately?

07:30.708 --> 07:33.958
Dr. Franklin? No, not in five,
maybe, six days.

07:34.042 --> 07:35.708
He's still out on that,
uh, what do you call it?

07:35.792 --> 07:38.833
- Walkabout.
- Oh, yeah. Right. Ha ha.

07:38.917 --> 07:40.250
He told one of the guys

07:40.333 --> 07:43.458
that he's got to keep walking
until he meets himself.

07:43.542 --> 07:45.542
Kind of weird, but around here,
what isn't?

07:45.625 --> 07:47.500
Yeah. You know,
I've just be thinking.

07:47.583 --> 07:48.875
He shouldn't be doing this.

07:48.958 --> 07:50.042
He shouldn't
have to be doing this.

07:50.125 --> 07:52.333
I-I feel like, I screwed up.

07:52.417 --> 07:53.542
Hey, come on, chief.

07:53.625 --> 07:56.042
It's not your fault.
I heard what happened.

07:56.125 --> 07:58.958
You offered to help,
he walked away.

07:59.042 --> 08:00.583
Yeah, I know, the thing is

08:00.667 --> 08:03.458
sometimes people walk away
because they wanna be alone.

08:03.542 --> 08:05.417
Sometimes they walk away
because they wanna see

08:05.500 --> 08:07.792
if you care enough
to follow them into hell.

08:07.875 --> 08:09.375
I think I went the wrong way.

08:09.458 --> 08:13.375
Look, he's got to get his head
screwed on straight.

08:13.458 --> 08:15.375
You can't do that for him.

08:15.458 --> 08:17.417
Ah, you're right, it's just..

08:18.792 --> 08:21.083
...uh, I've had my own problems.

08:21.167 --> 08:23.583
I've been where he is. I..

08:23.667 --> 08:25.667
I've walked away from
a lot of things in my life.

08:27.167 --> 08:29.000
I just hope he can
find his way back again.

08:50.417 --> 08:52.583
(Barbara)
'Now, according
to the station map'

08:52.667 --> 08:55.875
'this is Downbelow.
Stay close, Jessie.'

08:55.958 --> 08:57.375
'Well, I don't understand.'

08:57.458 --> 08:59.542
It says here,
this is a marketplace.

08:59.625 --> 09:02.667
Well, I don't see much
house.

09:02.750 --> 09:04.792
You'd think they could take
better care of the place.

09:04.875 --> 09:06.375
Don't stray, Jessie.

09:06.458 --> 09:08.917
Uh, it says
this is the kind of place

09:09.000 --> 09:11.292
to mind your purse
and your wallet.

09:11.375 --> 09:13.208
Well, I heard all this

09:13.292 --> 09:15.458
is because of their
so called revolution.

09:15.542 --> 09:18.208
Breaking away from Earth like
that. What were they thinking?

09:18.292 --> 09:21.125
Well, Barbara, we do have
homeless back home.

09:21.208 --> 09:22.250
Shh!

09:23.417 --> 09:25.167
'James Cooper,
I've told you before'

09:25.250 --> 09:27.292
'not to contradict me
in front of Jessie.'

09:27.375 --> 09:29.542
'It's not good for her.'

09:29.625 --> 09:31.625
President Clark
says that people like this

09:31.708 --> 09:33.292
are the result
of social problems

09:33.375 --> 09:34.875
'not economic problems.'

09:34.958 --> 09:37.917
'They've fixed the economy,
and that's good enough for me.'

09:38.000 --> 09:39.625
You know, ever since you came
back from your mother's

09:39.708 --> 09:41.375
'it's been the same thing.'

09:41.458 --> 09:43.292
(James)
'But she reads a lot, and--'

09:43.375 --> 09:46.333
(Barbara)
'Oh, she reads trash,
just like you do sometimes.'

09:46.958 --> 09:48.333
Jessie!

09:49.958 --> 09:52.167
I told you to stay away
from strange people.

09:52.250 --> 09:54.750
'You don't know where he's been.
Now, come on.'

10:13.667 --> 10:14.708
Marcus.

10:15.583 --> 10:17.167
Marcus.

10:17.250 --> 10:19.000
- Marcus!
- What?

10:19.083 --> 10:21.458
- I'm awake.
- It's your watch.

10:21.542 --> 10:24.292
Right. I knew that.
I was just resting my eyes.

10:26.208 --> 10:27.875
Nascen fek.

10:27.958 --> 10:30.708
'Si dromo.'
- What was that?

10:30.792 --> 10:32.208
I told the computer
to run another check

10:32.292 --> 10:34.042
on the weapons systems

10:34.125 --> 10:35.792
just to be sure they're ready.

10:35.875 --> 10:37.458
You seem pretty fluent
in Minbari.

10:37.542 --> 10:38.833
You can't finish your training

10:38.917 --> 10:42.083
until you can speak
and think in their language.

10:43.333 --> 10:45.042
I am surprised.

10:45.125 --> 10:46.375
When they were training
the rangers

10:46.458 --> 10:48.375
I figured
they'd emphasize infiltration

10:48.458 --> 10:51.250
and combat techniques.
Not language skills.

10:51.333 --> 10:53.000
For them it's all
the same thing.

10:53.083 --> 10:54.458
I could teach you, if you like.

10:54.542 --> 10:56.083
No. I don't have the time.

10:56.167 --> 10:58.708
It would take me a year.

10:58.792 --> 11:01.083
And assuming we survive this

11:01.167 --> 11:03.292
how old will you be in a year

11:03.375 --> 11:05.792
if you don't learn
to speak Minbari?

11:07.750 --> 11:09.292
- The same.
- 'Exactly.'

11:11.292 --> 11:13.458
[speaking Minbari]

11:16.333 --> 11:18.417
And what does that mean?

11:18.500 --> 11:20.625
It's...just a greeting.

11:22.750 --> 11:25.083
It means..

11:25.167 --> 11:28.542
...my words are inadequate
to the burden of my heart.

11:29.958 --> 11:31.917
Well, that's
an unusual greeting.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.167
Well, they're an unusual people.

11:36.667 --> 11:39.333
- Well..
- I'll wake you in four hours.

11:39.417 --> 11:41.583
Thanks. I was assuming
I can get any sleep in these.

11:41.667 --> 11:45.292
The captain warned me about
these things but I had no idea.

11:45.375 --> 11:47.750
They're very restful.
Good for the back.

11:47.833 --> 11:49.750
Well, someday I'd like to be
stationed somewhere

11:49.833 --> 11:53.750
big
four-poster bed canopy

11:53.833 --> 11:57.958
and maybe a window
with a view of a garden.

11:58.042 --> 11:59.500
I like gardens.

12:00.958 --> 12:02.792
And big four poster beds.

12:07.708 --> 12:10.250
Right. See you in four hours.

12:14.500 --> 12:15.750
[sighs]

12:18.917 --> 12:19.958
Oh.

12:35.042 --> 12:36.667
Ah, that's better.

12:39.625 --> 12:40.667
[sighs]

12:43.417 --> 12:44.833
[clanking]

12:50.000 --> 12:51.083
[Ivanova sighs]

12:54.000 --> 12:55.125
[machine beeps]

12:55.208 --> 12:56.292
Come.

12:57.792 --> 12:58.875
'Delenn.'

13:01.042 --> 13:02.292
What's our status?

13:07.542 --> 13:09.625
They're still holding back.

13:09.708 --> 13:11.333
(Delenn)
'It will have to do.'

13:11.417 --> 13:13.042
'Getting them was hard enough.'

13:13.125 --> 13:15.458
Keeping them as this drags on..

13:15.542 --> 13:18.542
...that's going to be
really hard.

13:18.625 --> 13:21.208
The Dogato is standing by,
waiting for us.

13:21.292 --> 13:22.708
As soon as we're aboard

13:22.792 --> 13:24.208
they'll join
the rest of the fleet.

13:24.292 --> 13:26.625
I still think
you should stay here.

13:26.708 --> 13:30.125
With Ivanova, Marcus,
and me gone, I mean..

13:30.208 --> 13:31.875
And Garibaldi's up to his ears.

13:31.958 --> 13:33.333
Franklin's still
on walkabout--

13:33.417 --> 13:35.542
John, we've been over this.

13:35.625 --> 13:38.708
I should be there.
With you and with the fleet.

13:38.792 --> 13:40.792
- We're in this together.
- I know.

13:40.875 --> 13:43.833
And...afterward..

13:43.917 --> 13:46.167
...when we've finished
with this..

13:46.250 --> 13:47.708
...we will spend
the night together.

13:51.125 --> 13:53.417
Not like that.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.833
You see, when Minbari become

13:55.917 --> 13:58.375
close as we have become close.

13:58.458 --> 14:01.833
It is tradition that they spend
three nights together.

14:01.917 --> 14:03.417
The male sleeps

14:03.500 --> 14:05.000
and the female watches.

14:05.083 --> 14:07.083
W-watches what?

14:07.167 --> 14:10.042
During the day,
we all put on the face

14:10.125 --> 14:12.583
we think will do us
the most good.

14:12.667 --> 14:15.917
But at a certain point
in your sleep, as you relax

14:16.000 --> 14:18.542
your true face is revealed.

14:18.625 --> 14:21.875
If the female approves
of his true face

14:21.958 --> 14:24.917
she will stay two more nights
and continue to observe.

14:25.000 --> 14:29.625
Mmm. Well, what if she doesn't
like what she sees?

14:29.708 --> 14:32.083
Then they go
their separate ways.

14:32.167 --> 14:35.208
If he insists
she stay one more night

14:35.292 --> 14:37.292
she can leave
when he falls asleep

14:37.375 --> 14:39.292
file a complaint
with the elders

14:39.375 --> 14:42.083
even cut off his, um

14:42.167 --> 14:44.375
his access to her family.

14:46.500 --> 14:47.708
Oh.

14:48.917 --> 14:50.625
Uh..

14:50.708 --> 14:52.833
What if she does

14:52.917 --> 14:54.875
like what she sees?

14:54.958 --> 14:56.000
Later.

14:57.125 --> 14:58.333
History awaits.

14:58.417 --> 15:01.375
[instrumental music]

15:15.458 --> 15:16.708
(male #1)
'No!'

15:16.792 --> 15:17.833
(male #2)
'Hey, you leave him for me'

15:17.917 --> 15:19.333
'Leave him for me.'

15:19.417 --> 15:22.000
[grunting]

15:22.083 --> 15:23.833
(male #1)
'Get away.
Get the hell away from me.'

15:23.917 --> 15:25.708
- 'Get away from me.'
- 'Get the bag.'

15:25.792 --> 15:28.500
[grunting]

15:28.583 --> 15:31.417
- 'Stop it. No, stop don't.'
- 'Come on.'

15:31.500 --> 15:32.708
- 'Stop it!'
- 'Aw! Man, he bit me.'

15:32.792 --> 15:34.500
[grunting]

15:34.583 --> 15:37.458
(male #3)
'Give me the bag, or I'll cut
your freakin' throat.'

15:37.542 --> 15:39.958
- 'Get away from me!'
- 'No!'

15:40.042 --> 15:42.167
Give me the bag, damn it.

15:42.250 --> 15:44.333
Let it go, or I'm gonna cut
your freakin' throat.

15:44.417 --> 15:46.583
Hey, hey, hey!
Leave him alone.

15:46.667 --> 15:49.083
Huh?

15:49.167 --> 15:51.708
Now, look, if-if there's a
problem, we can handle it

15:51.792 --> 15:54.500
some other way. Aah.

15:54.583 --> 15:55.667
Hey! No!

15:55.750 --> 15:57.000
'Wait! Let-let's talk!'

15:57.083 --> 15:59.333
No! No! Wait, wait. Aah!

16:01.167 --> 16:02.500
What the hell
did you do that for?

16:02.583 --> 16:04.208
You want him getting
into our business?

16:04.292 --> 16:06.000
You're nuts, man, you know that?

16:06.083 --> 16:07.083
Come on, let's get out of here.

16:07.167 --> 16:08.750
- Ha, ha, ha!
- Come on.

16:12.583 --> 16:13.792
[coughs]

16:15.958 --> 16:17.000
Help me.

16:18.042 --> 16:19.208
Help me.

16:19.292 --> 16:21.708
- I can't.
- Ohh. Help me.

16:21.792 --> 16:23.333
I can't. I was selling.

16:23.417 --> 16:24.875
They'd arrest me, too.

16:24.958 --> 16:26.083
Please help me.

16:26.167 --> 16:28.292
[heavy breathing]

16:29.458 --> 16:31.792
- I'm sorry. I can't.
- Help me.

16:31.875 --> 16:33.583
[groaning]

16:37.625 --> 16:39.625
[groaning]

16:43.708 --> 16:45.375
Help me!

16:45.458 --> 16:48.375
Help! Somebody!

16:48.458 --> 16:50.625
Is anybody, can you hear me?

16:50.708 --> 16:52.333
I, I need help.

16:52.417 --> 16:55.458
[groaning]

17:02.875 --> 17:04.417
Oh, man.

17:04.500 --> 17:06.083
Oh, God.

17:06.167 --> 17:08.083
Oh, this is not good.

17:10.542 --> 17:11.583
[grunts]

17:17.708 --> 17:18.875
Oh.

17:20.333 --> 17:21.917
Ah, finally.

17:25.750 --> 17:26.792
[machine beeps]

17:26.875 --> 17:27.958
(Marcus on PA)
'Ivanova to the bridge.'

17:28.042 --> 17:29.583
'Ivanova to the bridge.'

17:34.208 --> 17:35.417
- Are they here?
- Not exactly.

17:35.500 --> 17:36.708
But you'd better
take a look at this.

17:36.792 --> 17:38.375
We picked it up
a few minutes ago.

17:38.458 --> 17:40.333
Scanners indicate
it's composed of materials

17:40.417 --> 17:42.542
similar to the Shadow vessels,
but it's much smaller.

17:42.625 --> 17:44.083
(Ivanova)
'A scout ship?'

17:44.167 --> 17:45.375
(Marcus)
'Our opposite number,
sent in to'

17:45.458 --> 17:46.958
'make sure the area's clear'

17:47.042 --> 17:48.667
'before the main Armada
comes in.'

17:48.750 --> 17:50.292
It's close.
Has it seen us yet?

17:50.375 --> 17:52.917
I don't think so. We're not
picking up any transmissions.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.792
Good. Anything else?

17:54.875 --> 17:57.292
Well, yes, you see,
I spotted this

17:57.375 --> 17:58.792
just as we were
about to correct course

17:58.875 --> 18:00.583
to stay in the shadow
of that moon.

18:00.667 --> 18:01.958
Good, don't.

18:02.042 --> 18:03.208
It could read the energy
if we use the engines.

18:03.292 --> 18:04.917
It would be like
sending up a flare.

18:05.042 --> 18:08.167
Yes, but unfortunately, we're
about to move out of eclipse.

18:08.250 --> 18:10.375
And as soon as we're
out in the light..

18:13.083 --> 18:14.250
(Ivanova)
'Oh, hell.'

18:20.875 --> 18:23.000
- It's seen us.
- Picking up a transmission.

18:23.083 --> 18:25.667
- Looks like a warning signal.
- Jam it. Engines at maximum.

18:25.750 --> 18:27.667
We have to stop it before
it can warn the others.

18:30.917 --> 18:33.125
The other White Star
class ships have been alerted.

18:33.208 --> 18:34.625
They'll meet us
at the other end.

18:34.708 --> 18:36.833
- Good. And the telepaths?
- Safe below decks.

18:36.917 --> 18:39.333
All the other cruisers have at
least one telepath onboard

18:39.417 --> 18:41.208
to help them slow down
the enemy.

18:41.292 --> 18:42.917
I'll go check to make sure.

18:45.833 --> 18:48.292
- Anything yet from Ivanova?
- No.

18:48.375 --> 18:51.208
It probably means the enemy
hasn't appeared yet, but..

18:51.292 --> 18:52.917
They can take care
of themselves.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.708
They'll be fine.

19:08.958 --> 19:11.167
this place?

19:11.250 --> 19:12.625
It's our tactical center.

19:12.708 --> 19:14.875
From here, we can
keep track of the battle.

19:16.125 --> 19:18.292
How? I-I don't see any displays.

19:19.625 --> 19:22.208
You will see
when the time comes.

19:31.125 --> 19:33.042
(Franklin)
'Hey.'

19:34.375 --> 19:36.125
'Anybody?'

19:38.417 --> 19:39.667
'Hey!'

19:41.833 --> 19:43.583
Somebody!

19:46.833 --> 19:48.125
[coughs]

19:49.458 --> 19:51.042
Stupid.

19:52.750 --> 19:55.000
Grade A stupid.

19:55.083 --> 19:58.833
that, wasn't it?

20:00.000 --> 20:02.792
Always trying to be the hero.

20:02.875 --> 20:04.250
Never stopping to think first.

20:04.333 --> 20:06.500
Now, now, look
where it's got you. Hmm?

20:08.125 --> 20:09.917
Must be going into shock.

20:10.042 --> 20:12.792
You said you had to keep walking
until you met yourself.

20:14.667 --> 20:17.375
Well? Here I am.

20:17.458 --> 20:21.417
So, if we're gonna talk,
let's talk.

20:21.500 --> 20:23.583
But I don't think you have
a lot of time.

20:23.667 --> 20:24.792
Ohh.

20:24.875 --> 20:27.667
[intense music]

20:30.917 --> 20:32.125
[zapping]

20:33.708 --> 20:34.958
- No damage.
- Keep on his tail.

20:35.042 --> 20:36.375
If he gets out of jamming range,
we've had it.

20:36.458 --> 20:38.083
Standby weapons system,
prepare to fire.

20:38.167 --> 20:39.750
What happens
if he doesn't report in?

20:39.833 --> 20:41.625
I don't know, but I do know
what happens if he gets away.

20:41.708 --> 20:43.667
Let's just hope they're only
supposed to break radio silence

20:43.750 --> 20:45.292
if there was a problem.

20:46.958 --> 20:48.042
Stand by.

20:49.208 --> 20:50.167
Fire!

20:50.250 --> 20:51.875
[zapping]

20:52.000 --> 20:53.167
[explosion]

20:55.792 --> 20:58.500
- It's gonna ram us.
- Hard to port. Fire!

21:04.625 --> 21:06.458
- Damage report.
- Engines hit.

21:06.542 --> 21:08.583
Automatic repair
systems engaged.

21:08.667 --> 21:10.542
It'll take a while, won't it?
Wait a minute.

21:10.625 --> 21:13.417
I'm picking up an energy surge.
Distance, 5,000 kilometers.

21:13.500 --> 21:15.083
Show me!

21:16.292 --> 21:18.000
[whooshing]

21:27.708 --> 21:30.042
That's a lot of ships.

21:30.125 --> 21:32.417
That's a bloody awful
lot of ships.

21:32.500 --> 21:34.208
Jump engines, back on line yet?

21:34.292 --> 21:37.875
No. If I signal the fleet,
this lot might pick it up.

21:37.958 --> 21:40.125
If they do
and we can't get away.

21:41.125 --> 21:43.917
Well, who wants
to live forever?

21:45.292 --> 21:48.458
I do, actually.
But what the hell?

21:50.083 --> 21:51.250
Signal away.

21:58.125 --> 21:59.667
[electricity crackling]

22:02.125 --> 22:03.417
- The signal.
- I heard.

22:03.500 --> 22:05.375
Tell the others to follow us in.

22:05.458 --> 22:07.250
I just hope Ivanova
got out in time.

22:10.958 --> 22:12.625
- 'Engines?'
- 'Not yet.'

22:12.708 --> 22:13.875
They're getting closer.

22:13.958 --> 22:15.667
I know, estimate
they're three hours

22:15.750 --> 22:17.042
from this system's
primary target

22:17.125 --> 22:19.375
less than 20 minutes from us.

22:19.458 --> 22:20.750
Uh-huh.

22:28.500 --> 22:30.333
(Franklin)
'You know what your problem is?'

22:31.750 --> 22:33.458
All your life

22:33.542 --> 22:35.042
you've run away
from everything.

22:36.708 --> 22:38.458
Home didn't work out.

22:38.542 --> 22:39.708
Wouldn't talk to your father.

22:39.792 --> 22:42.167
So you just...walked away.

22:44.083 --> 22:46.917
'You didn't have the patience
for a long internship back home'

22:47.000 --> 22:50.792
'so you just ran off and started
hitchhiking on starships.'

22:51.958 --> 22:53.417
You didn't want to turn over

22:53.500 --> 22:56.708
your precious notes on Minbari
biology during the war

22:56.792 --> 23:00.958
so you just burned them instead
and walked away again.

23:01.042 --> 23:04.625
You use work to run away
from your personal life

23:04.708 --> 23:07.208
'and stims to run away
from your work.'

23:08.583 --> 23:10.125
'And right now..'

23:11.542 --> 23:13.667
...you are running away

23:13.750 --> 23:15.250
from everything.

23:15.333 --> 23:16.833
[coughs]

23:16.917 --> 23:19.375
Don't you die on me yet.

23:19.458 --> 23:21.167
I'm not through with you.

23:22.708 --> 23:24.750
You finally had it all,
didn't you?

23:25.833 --> 23:27.958
You had a good job.

23:28.042 --> 23:30.875
'People who cared about you
and you messed it up.'

23:32.333 --> 23:34.625
"I have to leave
before they fire me."

23:34.708 --> 23:36.042
"I have to go find myself."

23:36.125 --> 23:37.833
What a bunch of mealy-mouthed

23:37.917 --> 23:40.000
self-indulgent,
foundationist crap.

23:40.083 --> 23:41.625
[groaning]

23:41.708 --> 23:45.667
Take responsibility for your
actions, for crying out loud.

23:45.750 --> 23:48.875
You go in there and you fight
for what matters to you.

23:48.958 --> 23:51.250
Don't just walk away
because it's easier.

23:51.333 --> 23:53.708
- I didn't..
- 'What'd you say?'

23:53.792 --> 23:57.458
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot.

23:57.542 --> 23:59.542
You're too busy dying,
aren't you?

23:59.625 --> 24:02.042
I guess that's a little bit
more important to you right now.

24:02.125 --> 24:03.750
[gasping]

24:03.833 --> 24:06.583
Well, fine,
you do what you want

24:06.667 --> 24:09.958
because you and I,
time ago.

24:10.042 --> 24:11.417
So you go ahead and you die

24:11.500 --> 24:14.208
because I really
don't care anymore.

24:14.292 --> 24:15.583
[gasping]

24:21.500 --> 24:23.417
A little longer, and we'll have
power to engines. We--

24:23.500 --> 24:24.667
[beeping]

24:24.750 --> 24:26.250
Uh-oh.

24:30.458 --> 24:32.208
One of them has picked us up.
Moving to intercept.

24:32.292 --> 24:33.667
Okay, this is it.
Stand by to--

24:33.750 --> 24:35.292
Picking up an energy spike.

24:35.375 --> 24:38.167
[intense music]

24:57.833 --> 24:59.458
They can hear me from here?

24:59.542 --> 25:00.875
Yes.

25:06.833 --> 25:10.083
This is Captain John Sheridan
to attack fleet.

25:10.167 --> 25:13.125
Have your telepaths start
jamming their capital ships.

25:22.000 --> 25:25.167
Fighters...take point.

25:25.250 --> 25:26.750
'They've put escort ships
in front'

25:26.833 --> 25:30.208
'as buffers between our
telepaths and their big ships.'

25:30.292 --> 25:32.833
'Take them out any way you can
and clear the way.'

25:32.917 --> 25:34.792
'Sunhawks
and other medium-class ships'

25:34.875 --> 25:37.292
'provide escort
for our big guns.'

25:37.375 --> 25:39.083
Everyone else..

25:39.167 --> 25:41.250
...break and attack.

25:41.333 --> 25:44.417
[zapping]

25:49.042 --> 25:52.542
(Franklin)
'Blood pressure's
dropping fast.'

25:52.625 --> 25:55.042
You should be getting
real cold right about now.

25:55.125 --> 25:56.792
Yeah, that's shock and trauma.

25:56.875 --> 25:58.667
And the rest will follow soon.

25:58.750 --> 26:00.500
You know, so we can
get this over with.

26:00.583 --> 26:02.458
I mean, you weren't that happy
with your life

26:02.542 --> 26:04.375
in the first place, were you?

26:04.458 --> 26:06.750
'This one's hardly been used.'

26:06.833 --> 26:10.292
- I wa-I want..
- 'You want what?'

26:10.375 --> 26:12.167
I mean, what-what do you want?

26:12.250 --> 26:13.958
What could you possibly want?

26:14.042 --> 26:18.625
I-I, I, I want to do it
all again.

26:18.708 --> 26:21.042
Why?
You'd just mess it up again.

26:21.125 --> 26:22.708
You..

26:22.792 --> 26:24.917
[groaning]

26:25.042 --> 26:26.875
'Now, where do you
think you're going?'

26:29.875 --> 26:32.417
I wanna,
I wanna do it again.

26:34.625 --> 26:36.500
I want..

26:36.583 --> 26:38.042
I wanna do it again.

26:38.125 --> 26:39.500
Is that right?

26:40.917 --> 26:43.042
Well, then get up
off the damn floor.

26:44.542 --> 26:46.833
I don't care
how much it hurts.

26:46.917 --> 26:48.333
Don't you go passing out on me

26:48.417 --> 26:50.833
'cause that's just
another kind of running away.

26:50.917 --> 26:52.958
Now, you take responsibility.

26:53.042 --> 26:54.667
Show me that you want it.

26:54.750 --> 26:56.583
Get up off the damn floor.

26:58.333 --> 26:59.583
That's it. Come on.

26:59.667 --> 27:02.333
Come on. Get up
on your own two feet.

27:02.417 --> 27:04.917
Stand up. You stand up.

27:06.667 --> 27:09.875
I wanna do it all over again.

27:12.542 --> 27:14.250
Engines online.

27:31.125 --> 27:34.250
- Damage report!
- Targeting system hit!

27:34.333 --> 27:35.792
Go manual!

27:41.792 --> 27:43.167
They're trying to outflank us.

27:43.250 --> 27:45.208
Carrier groups,
come about and engage.

27:45.292 --> 27:48.083
[intense music]

27:49.667 --> 27:51.667
[zapping]

27:54.458 --> 27:56.042
[explosion]

27:56.125 --> 27:57.875
The Drazi ships are surrounded.

27:59.375 --> 28:03.292
Minbari cruiser and Enfili
pull back. Protect the Drazi.

28:03.375 --> 28:06.208
[music continues]

28:19.750 --> 28:21.250
Ohh!

28:30.250 --> 28:32.083
[groans]

28:42.250 --> 28:45.042
[zapping]

28:51.208 --> 28:54.250
[music continues]

29:34.333 --> 29:36.542
(Franklin)
'Help me!'

29:36.625 --> 29:38.500
'Help me!'

29:38.583 --> 29:40.250
Help me. Help me.

29:41.833 --> 29:45.000
I wanna do it again.
Help me.

29:45.083 --> 29:47.542
[indistinct chatter]

29:50.375 --> 29:52.333
[intense music]

29:52.417 --> 29:53.917
[inaudible dialogue]

30:40.250 --> 30:41.583
[intense music]

30:41.667 --> 30:43.458
[indistinct chatter]

30:53.167 --> 30:55.750
(Franklin)
'Guess I really
screwed up, huh?'

30:55.833 --> 30:58.000
Guess we're all entitled to one.

31:05.875 --> 31:07.458
(John)
They'll need
immediate treatment.

31:07.542 --> 31:10.375
'Mostly burns, but there may be
some radiation scarring.'

31:10.458 --> 31:12.042
Take over whatever
space you need.

31:12.125 --> 31:14.417
We've got four more shuttles
with wounded coming through.

31:14.500 --> 31:15.667
I'll accompany them.

31:15.750 --> 31:17.292
I heard about Franklin.
How is he?

31:17.375 --> 31:18.958
Serious but stable.
He lost a lot of blood.

31:19.042 --> 31:20.042
Dr. Hobbs said it's practically

31:20.125 --> 31:21.292
a miracle
he could walk that far.

31:21.375 --> 31:22.458
The knife cut pretty deep into

31:22.542 --> 31:24.125
the muscle tissue on the way in.

31:26.875 --> 31:27.917
So how'd it go out there?

31:28.000 --> 31:29.917
We did okay
not great, but okay.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.125
We turned back their attack,
but we lost a lot of ships.

31:32.208 --> 31:33.792
For every one of
their ships we killed

31:33.875 --> 31:35.208
two of ours were destroyed.

31:35.292 --> 31:36.583
This time we had the advantage.

31:36.667 --> 31:38.125
We knew where they were
going to attack.

31:38.208 --> 31:39.458
Next time,
we won't be so lucky.

31:39.542 --> 31:40.625
Still, it's the first time
we've managed

31:40.708 --> 31:42.000
to bring all
the league worlds together

31:42.083 --> 31:43.750
and organize them
into a fighting force.

31:43.833 --> 31:45.333
That counts for a lot.

31:46.667 --> 31:47.958
So here's the big question.

31:48.042 --> 31:49.417
Now that we've shown them
we can hurt them

31:49.500 --> 31:52.417
how long until they come
knocking at our front door?

31:54.542 --> 31:56.125
That's what worries me.

32:23.583 --> 32:26.292
(Garibaldi)
'It's about time you woke up.'

32:26.375 --> 32:29.167
We were taking bets on when
you were gonna come around.

32:29.250 --> 32:31.333
I want you to know
I've lost 30 credits already.

32:31.417 --> 32:34.500
I guess I'm just
too much of an optimist.

32:34.583 --> 32:36.417
So how do you feel?

32:36.500 --> 32:38.542
Like I was stabbed in the back
and left to die.

32:38.625 --> 32:40.333
How the hell should I feel?

32:40.417 --> 32:43.375
Well, he's back to normal.
As grouchy as ever.

32:45.750 --> 32:47.750
You know, with all this,
I just hope you found

32:47.833 --> 32:49.875
what you were looking for
out there.

32:49.958 --> 32:51.375
I don't know.

32:52.708 --> 32:54.917
Guess I found what I..

32:55.000 --> 32:57.583
...what I needed,
not what I wanted.

32:57.667 --> 32:58.750
Which was?

32:58.833 --> 33:00.375
A short, sharp kick
to the head.

33:00.458 --> 33:01.958
Oh, well, hell,
I could've done that for you.

33:02.042 --> 33:03.208
All you had to do was ask.

33:03.292 --> 33:05.542
Yeah, well, you would've
enjoyed it too much.

33:07.167 --> 33:09.333
So you didn't, uh

33:09.417 --> 33:10.875
meet yourself?

33:10.958 --> 33:13.208
Yeah, I did.

33:13.292 --> 33:15.917
Found out I didn't
like myself, either.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.625
Well, as revelations go,
I guess I've heard worse.

33:20.292 --> 33:22.167
'I'd better let you get
some rest. You need it.'

33:24.000 --> 33:26.708
Oh, one last thing.

33:28.167 --> 33:29.292
I know you had to do this

33:29.375 --> 33:31.083
and I know you learned
a lot by doing it.

33:31.167 --> 33:34.583
But just don't ever
do this to me again.

33:34.667 --> 33:36.958
You were concerned.
I'm touched.

33:37.042 --> 33:38.542
Hell, no.

33:38.625 --> 33:41.042
I just can't afford
to lose another 30 credits.

33:41.125 --> 33:42.458
[chuckles]

34:07.375 --> 34:10.625
I've been giving a lot of
thought to Garibaldi's question.

34:10.708 --> 34:13.458
We have done all we can
to keep a low profile.

34:13.542 --> 34:16.417
But the enemy
loss.

34:16.500 --> 34:19.125
They've got to know
we're responsible.

34:19.208 --> 34:21.500
Now it's only a matter of time
before they come after us.

34:21.583 --> 34:24.542
So the only questions
are how and when.

34:24.625 --> 34:26.792
Perhaps
they're reluctant to try.

34:26.875 --> 34:28.250
Draal has made the great machine

34:28.333 --> 34:30.958
on the planet below
available to our defense.

34:31.042 --> 34:33.750
I suspect his weapons
could stop even a Shadow vessel.

34:33.833 --> 34:35.167
Maybe, but that's
the odd thing about this.

34:35.250 --> 34:36.583
I mean, they could've hit us
at any time

34:36.667 --> 34:38.542
during the last year.
We're a sitting duck.

34:38.625 --> 34:39.958
So what are you saying

34:40.042 --> 34:41.667
they're deliberately
leaving us alone?

34:41.750 --> 34:43.458
It's possible, I mean,
they haven't exactly been

34:43.542 --> 34:45.500
shy about hitting
anybody else around here.

34:45.583 --> 34:48.292
'And if that's true,
the obvious question is why?'

34:50.375 --> 34:52.083
Captain?

34:54.833 --> 34:56.500
Do you know who I am?

34:59.833 --> 35:01.167
Are you okay?

35:02.333 --> 35:04.167
I'm not sure.

35:04.250 --> 35:05.167
Ever since Kosh died

35:05.250 --> 35:07.833
I've been remembering a dream.

35:07.917 --> 35:09.458
Last year, when I was hurt

35:09.542 --> 35:11.833
he got inside my head.
He spoke to me.

35:11.917 --> 35:15.083
Sent me these images.

35:15.167 --> 35:19.167
One of them was you saying,
"Do you know who I am?"

35:19.250 --> 35:22.833
'A week later, you tell me
you're a latent telepath.'

35:22.917 --> 35:25.708
Said you sometimes
don't know who you are.

35:25.792 --> 35:27.500
Is it possible he knew?

35:27.583 --> 35:30.375
I don't see how,
but the image fits.

35:30.458 --> 35:31.833
Do you remember anything else?

35:32.917 --> 35:34.417
No, just fragments.

35:35.708 --> 35:37.083
Oh, at one point

35:37.167 --> 35:39.292
I was wearing
the uniform of a Psi Cop.

35:40.750 --> 35:42.167
Well, we're working
with Bester now

35:42.250 --> 35:44.042
and that was unexpected.

35:44.125 --> 35:45.708
So that tracks.

35:45.792 --> 35:46.958
Anything else?

35:47.042 --> 35:49.750
He sent me an image
of Garibaldi saying..

35:49.833 --> 35:52.000
The man in between
is searching for you.

35:53.292 --> 35:56.917
"The man in between"
he could've meant...Sinclair.

35:57.000 --> 35:58.583
Maybe, but I don't think so.

35:58.667 --> 36:01.583
Somehow it doesn't feel right.

36:01.667 --> 36:03.708
The last thing was you,
dressed all in black

36:03.792 --> 36:06.708
as if for a funeral. You said..

36:06.792 --> 36:08.458
"You are the hand."

36:08.542 --> 36:09.667
"You are the hand?"

36:09.750 --> 36:11.167
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

36:11.250 --> 36:13.000
Why would I say anything
as dopey-sounding as that?

36:13.083 --> 36:14.875
I don't know.

36:14.958 --> 36:17.417
But if Kosh sent it,
it must've meant something.

36:17.500 --> 36:19.708
Odd that he would use
that image, though.

36:19.792 --> 36:20.917
Why?

36:21.000 --> 36:23.333
Well, you have
two hands, do you not?

36:23.417 --> 36:25.083
Each equal and opposite.

36:25.167 --> 36:27.292
So you're saying
that the man in between

36:27.375 --> 36:30.250
is your equal and opposite?

36:38.125 --> 36:39.000
Maybe.

36:39.083 --> 36:40.500
Well, if that's what it is

36:40.583 --> 36:42.750
then the man in between
knows who you are

36:42.833 --> 36:44.792
now that we've kicked him hard
and where it hurts.

36:44.875 --> 36:47.458
Assuming it means anything.

36:47.542 --> 36:50.042
Signs, portents, dreams.

36:50.125 --> 36:53.292
Next we'll be reading tea leaves
and chicken entrails.

36:53.375 --> 36:56.042
All we do know
is that we are vulnerable now.

36:57.250 --> 36:59.792
I want squadrons on flyby
at all times.

36:59.875 --> 37:01.125
'We should expect something'

37:01.208 --> 37:03.667
'to be coming our way
sooner or later.'

37:03.750 --> 37:07.708
And the way our luck works,
it'll probably be sooner.

37:15.458 --> 37:17.625
(Franklin)
'Alright, we're still short on
Minbari blood, type R-negative.'

37:17.708 --> 37:20.375
Nadia, I want you to check
with Ambassador Delenn

37:20.458 --> 37:22.625
see if you can organize
some more blood donors.

37:22.708 --> 37:24.500
The synthetics
aren't cutting it.

37:24.583 --> 37:27.250
Now the rest of you,
we've got trauma cases

37:27.333 --> 37:29.000
overloading Medlabs
two and five.

37:29.083 --> 37:30.542
I want you to get down
there see if you can move

37:30.625 --> 37:32.167
some of the
noncritical patients

37:32.250 --> 37:34.625
into other quarters
on a temporary basis.

37:34.708 --> 37:36.833
Take over the rotunda and
the sanctuary if you have to.

37:36.917 --> 37:38.417
Now go on.

37:41.667 --> 37:45.125
They told me you wouldn't be
up and about for a while.

37:45.208 --> 37:47.458
Well, I'm not.

37:47.542 --> 37:49.042
I won't be for a few days.

37:50.042 --> 37:52.833
Legs are still a little wobbly.

37:52.917 --> 37:54.375
I can only stand
for a few minutes

37:54.458 --> 37:58.250
but, uh, I don't need
to stand to talk, to advise

37:58.333 --> 38:01.000
and generally make
a pain in the ass of myself.

38:01.083 --> 38:03.167
'They know
it's unofficial, but..'

38:03.250 --> 38:05.542
...they can use
all the help they can get.

38:05.625 --> 38:08.125
That's why I came down
to see you, Stephen.

38:09.917 --> 38:11.792
Your job is waiting for you

38:11.875 --> 38:13.333
if you want it.

38:13.417 --> 38:14.792
Sure you wanna do this?

38:14.875 --> 38:16.500
If you're sure
you wanna take it.

38:19.792 --> 38:21.042
I want it.

38:22.583 --> 38:24.375
I think now I can do better.

38:25.708 --> 38:26.833
I mean, that was the problem.

38:26.917 --> 38:29.708
The stims, they..

38:29.792 --> 38:30.958
...they let me do more

38:31.042 --> 38:33.167
but what I needed
was to do better.

38:33.250 --> 38:34.375
I wish you'd come,
talked to me

38:34.458 --> 38:36.333
before you made
your decision to resign.

38:38.125 --> 38:39.750
I was running away.

38:41.083 --> 38:42.750
Same as I've always done.

38:44.750 --> 38:46.917
I didn't wanna face
how I'd feel if you fired me

38:47.000 --> 38:48.708
so I just quit.

38:48.792 --> 38:50.417
You had to find your own way.

38:50.500 --> 38:51.958
I ran away.

38:53.792 --> 38:56.750
I realized
that I always defined myself

38:56.833 --> 38:59.583
in terms of what I wasn't.

38:59.667 --> 39:01.875
I wasn't a good soldier
like my father.

39:01.958 --> 39:04.250
I wasn't the job. I, uh..

39:04.333 --> 39:06.625
I wasn't a good prospect
for marriage or kids.

39:06.708 --> 39:08.958
Always what I wasn't

39:09.042 --> 39:10.542
never what I was.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.542
And when you do that,
you miss the moments.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.833
And the moments
are all we've got.

39:20.500 --> 39:23.250
When I thought
I was gonna die

39:23.333 --> 39:25.292
even after everything
that's happened..

39:28.083 --> 39:29.750
...I realized
I didn't wanna let go.

39:31.500 --> 39:33.167
I was willing
to do it all over again.

39:33.250 --> 39:36.000
And this time, I could
appreciate the moments.

39:36.083 --> 39:37.833
I-I-I can't go back.

39:39.292 --> 39:42.958
But I can appreciate
what I have right now.

39:43.042 --> 39:45.625
And I can define myself
by what I am

39:45.708 --> 39:47.333
instead of what I'm not.

39:47.417 --> 39:49.000
And what are you?

39:50.208 --> 39:51.333
Alive.

39:53.083 --> 39:54.792
Everything else is negotiable.

39:54.875 --> 39:56.875
[machine beeps]

39:56.958 --> 39:58.125
Sheridan, go.

39:58.208 --> 39:59.583
(female #1)
'Captain, I have a message'

39:59.667 --> 40:01.042
'from Ambassador Delenn.'

40:01.125 --> 40:03.333
'She says she awaits
your pleasure.'

40:05.208 --> 40:07.042
Tell her I'll be right there.

40:08.458 --> 40:11.208
[sighs]
Well, it's getting late

40:11.292 --> 40:13.125
and you better get some rest.

40:13.208 --> 40:15.042
Don't worry. I intend to.

40:15.125 --> 40:16.792
It's good
to have you back, Stephen.

40:16.875 --> 40:18.333
Thank you.

40:18.417 --> 40:20.250
It's good to be back.

40:21.750 --> 40:23.125
Goodnight.

40:24.792 --> 40:27.458
Now where on Earth
did you learn

40:27.542 --> 40:29.167
to hold a cauterizer like that?

40:29.250 --> 40:30.958
Let me show you how to do this.

40:31.042 --> 40:32.333
Watch carefully.

40:46.167 --> 40:47.250
[beeping]

40:54.667 --> 40:57.458
[intense music]

41:29.958 --> 41:33.000
[music continues]

41:39.375 --> 41:41.208
(Zack)
'Commander?'

41:41.292 --> 41:42.750
'Commander Ivanova?'

41:43.792 --> 41:46.750
[sighs]
Give me a break.

41:46.833 --> 41:49.250
Receive transmission,
audio only.

41:49.333 --> 41:50.375
Yes?

41:50.458 --> 41:52.167
'Commander, just thought
you ought to know'

41:52.250 --> 41:55.083
'we just had somebody
come on board.'

41:55.167 --> 41:57.292
Zack, this is a space station.

41:57.375 --> 41:59.042
We get 50 ships a day.

41:59.125 --> 42:00.792
There's always someone
coming on board.

42:00.875 --> 42:03.750
'Yeah, but this is major.'

42:03.833 --> 42:05.792
'It concerns the captain.'

42:05.875 --> 42:07.250
Who is it?

42:08.500 --> 42:11.333
[instrumental music]

42:35.708 --> 42:37.125
[door opens]

42:40.708 --> 42:43.917
Hello. You must be Delenn.

42:44.000 --> 42:47.042
I'm Anna Sheridan,
John's wife.

42:50.250 --> 42:51.417
[glass shatters]

43:04.917 --> 43:06.875
[theme music]
