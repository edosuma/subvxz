Most mornings I wake up
thinking about the list.

00:06.974 --> 00:10.811
But sometimes I have more
important things on my mind,
like court.

I'm gonna ask the judge
to smash this walnut
with his judge hammer.

I bet it explodes
like a Death Star.

You might be disappointed,
like when you got that tow truck

He drove off before
I could get the wig on it.

Earl, thanks again
for loaning us all this money.
No problem, Crabman.

Besides,
what kind of man doesn't help
his ex-wife make bail?

00:31.232 --> 00:34.502
Recently, Joy and Bargain Bag
had a difference of opinion
on their return policy.

00:34.568 --> 00:36.937
- You can't return this.
- I have returned it.

00:37.004 --> 00:39.940
- And somehow or another,
I'm gonna get my $3,000 back.
- No, you won't.

- Yes, I will.
- No. You won't.

00:42.176 --> 00:45.246
- Yes, I will!
- In Joy's opinion, they were
being a little unethical.

- So she stole their truck.

in the Bargain Bag truck
than she bargained for.

00:55.022 --> 01:00.128
I tried to help Joy,
but she was goin' down a path
I could not follow.

01:00.194 --> 01:03.164
That path eventually
led her to jail.

- Settle down.

01:20.681 --> 01:24.552
I saw a guy back there
with pistachios, and I don't
want him to go before me.

I wasn't about to put my mouth
near that pay phone after

at one million dollars.

[ Earl Narrating ] Apparently,
this incident wasn't Joy's first
serious run-in with the law.

01:58.186 --> 02:01.522
Back in 1996,
Joy had a bright idea on how
to make some extra money.

Can we get some more green ink
in this machine?

Are you copying money?

I don't know how you're
gonna make bail, Joy.

I don't even have
that much money left.
But you still have some.

03:10.924 --> 03:14.728
We can take it and copy it
and then have a hundred grand.

you called me a whore.

No, you just misunderstood
what I said.
