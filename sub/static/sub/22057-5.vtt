WEBVTT

00:07.621 --> 00:08.898
Hey, don't you
give me that look.

00:08.899 --> 00:11.590
You know what you did.

00:14.728 --> 00:15.961
Yeah, all right.

00:15.963 --> 00:17.329
Right, I should've
taken you out sooner.

00:17.331 --> 00:18.330
Okay, this one's on me.

00:21.769 --> 00:23.569
Stay.

00:29.276 --> 00:31.777
You're not Steve.
No.

00:32.913 --> 00:35.180
Sorry, buddy. You, uh...
you must be Junior, right?

00:35.182 --> 00:37.449
Yes, sir.
Well, happy, uh...

00:37.451 --> 00:38.917
happy Halloween, Junior.

00:38.919 --> 00:41.920
Uh, you must be Detective
Danny Williams, aka Danno.

00:41.922 --> 00:43.255
Oh, that's funny.

00:43.257 --> 00:45.090
Did, uh... did Steve
tell you to say that?

00:45.092 --> 00:46.425
Yes, he did, sir.
Yeah.

00:46.427 --> 00:48.193
And I heard
about your fall.

00:48.195 --> 00:50.929
Yeah, well, this-- see,
Steve bought a cheap ladder

00:50.931 --> 00:52.264
for our restaurant
because he's cheap.

00:52.266 --> 00:53.732
And if he ordered
a nice ladder,

00:53.734 --> 00:55.100
this wouldn't have
happened. What, uh...

00:55.102 --> 00:56.635
you got a little accident
yourself over here?

00:56.637 --> 00:58.303
Yes, sir.

00:58.305 --> 00:59.571
He responsible or you?

00:59.573 --> 01:00.706
Him, sir.

01:00.708 --> 01:02.407
Yeah.

01:02.409 --> 01:04.242
Where's, uh...
where's Steve?

01:04.245 --> 01:06.111
He, uh... he went up
to the North Shore

01:06.113 --> 01:07.813
to escort Dr. Brown
to the courthouse.

01:07.815 --> 01:09.581
Oh, that's right.

01:09.583 --> 01:12.751
Well, I wasted $75 on
this beautiful mask

01:12.753 --> 01:14.753
and gas money to get
here to scare the guy,

01:14.755 --> 01:16.455
and he didn't even
have the courtesy

01:16.457 --> 01:17.144
to be here when I
got here, right?

01:17.168 --> 01:18.758
I'm sorry, sir.

01:18.759 --> 01:20.792
- Do me a favor.
- Yeah.

01:20.794 --> 01:22.728
You don't have to
call me “sir” so much.

01:22.730 --> 01:23.996
Maybe once every...
every couple sentences

01:23.998 --> 01:25.397
or... no, once every
three minutes.

01:25.399 --> 01:26.798
Something like that
would be fine.

01:26.800 --> 01:28.333
Yes, sir.

01:28.335 --> 01:30.435
Yes. Yeah.

01:30.437 --> 01:32.838
Yeah.

01:32.840 --> 01:35.374
Good to meet you, buddy.
All right, you too.

01:45.186 --> 01:47.085
Nice pumpkin.

01:48.222 --> 01:49.888
Thank you.

01:49.890 --> 01:53.525
Probably won't be any kids
coming this far out, but...

01:53.527 --> 01:56.395
it's tradition, right?

01:56.397 --> 01:58.997
Yeah.

01:58.999 --> 02:01.033
Yeah, you know,
Danny's daughter dropped one

02:01.035 --> 02:02.901
at my place yesterday.

02:05.239 --> 02:07.506
Ready to go?

02:08.642 --> 02:10.542
It's gonna be a
walk in the park.

02:10.544 --> 02:13.779
You got nothing
to worry about, okay?

02:25.392 --> 02:27.192
Remember, um...

02:27.194 --> 02:31.396
in my statement to the HPD,
I said that Gray

02:31.398 --> 02:33.699
came at me with a knife?

02:35.436 --> 02:37.202
That's not what happened.

02:37.204 --> 02:39.838
I need you to send officers
to my home right away.

02:39.840 --> 02:41.974
You're gonna put me in jail?
Come now, Alicia.

02:41.976 --> 02:44.276
Do you really think
that's gonna put an end to it?

02:44.278 --> 02:45.944
Ma'am, hello?

02:45.946 --> 02:48.981
There's only one way
to put an end to this.

02:48.983 --> 02:50.782
What's the nature
of your emergency?

02:50.784 --> 02:53.518
I need to report a murder.

02:53.520 --> 02:57.489
I could have held my gun on Gray
until HPD got there.

02:57.491 --> 03:00.392
I knew...

03:00.394 --> 03:02.995
that she was never
gonna let me go

03:02.997 --> 03:05.697
unless I put
a stop to it.

03:05.699 --> 03:07.733
Okay, um...

03:07.735 --> 03:09.635
first of all,
I didn't hear any of that.

03:09.637 --> 03:11.870
Okay? Second of all, Alicia,
you can never

03:11.872 --> 03:13.805
tell anybody
what you just told me.

03:13.807 --> 03:15.540
Do you understand?
You can't tell your lawyer.

03:15.542 --> 03:17.442
Not your daughter.
Nobody ever.

03:17.444 --> 03:19.311
Well, maybe they'll think of it
as self-defense

03:19.313 --> 03:21.313
and they'll let me go.

03:21.315 --> 03:23.248
Are you willing
to take that chance?

03:23.250 --> 03:25.684
I can't take the stand
and commit perjury.

03:26.820 --> 03:28.754
Then you don't take the stand.

03:28.756 --> 03:30.088
Okay? You don't testify.

03:30.090 --> 03:31.456
When a defendant

03:31.458 --> 03:33.792
in a murder trial
doesn't take the stand,

03:33.794 --> 03:35.060
it's basically
an admission of guilt.

03:35.062 --> 03:36.528
I just have
to tell the truth.

03:36.530 --> 03:37.929
If I don't,

03:37.931 --> 03:40.465
I'm just as bad
as the people I put away.

03:40.467 --> 03:41.733
Well, you know what?
You're wrong.

03:41.735 --> 03:43.268
That woman was a
serial killer.

03:43.270 --> 03:44.436
She deserved to die.

03:44.438 --> 03:45.771
And let me tell you
something else.

03:45.773 --> 03:46.772
The young lady in that house...

03:46.774 --> 03:47.906
Alicia, that young lady
in there,

03:47.908 --> 03:49.541
she lost her mother
for five years.

03:49.543 --> 03:50.942
She does not deserve

03:50.944 --> 03:52.077
to lose you again.

03:52.079 --> 03:53.512
Have you thought about that?

03:54.682 --> 03:56.648
I'm gonna put my faith
in the system.

03:56.650 --> 03:58.517
It was self-defense.

03:58.519 --> 03:59.851
What if that jury doesn't see it

03:59.853 --> 04:01.620
the way you see it?

04:04.458 --> 04:10.228
Then I... then I need to ask you
to take care of her.

I'm so glad
you accepted my invitation.

05:09.390 --> 05:11.890
How's Hawaii been treating you?

05:12.726 --> 05:15.160
Do I know you?

05:16.730 --> 05:19.197
Be thankful that you don't.

05:22.403 --> 05:23.769
I don't know you.

05:23.771 --> 05:26.371
You don't know me.
Why am I here?

05:26.373 --> 05:29.408
Do you like fried chicken, Lou?

05:30.377 --> 05:31.777
It's just
an innocent question.

05:31.779 --> 05:34.413
No cultural significance
implied.

05:37.684 --> 05:39.284
Yes.

05:39.286 --> 05:41.319
Yes, I do.

05:41.321 --> 05:43.955
But at my age,
I try to avoid it.

05:43.957 --> 05:46.158
Shame.

05:46.160 --> 05:48.593
I'm having Gus's World Famous
for dinner.

05:48.595 --> 05:50.796
Flown in special from Memphis.

05:52.166 --> 05:55.000
Best fried chicken
on the planet.

05:55.002 --> 05:57.369
Well, don't feel bad.
I had a lot of grape soda

05:57.371 --> 05:59.304
and watermelon on the plane.

05:59.306 --> 06:02.741
A plane that I rode on
for 11 uncomfortable hours

06:02.743 --> 06:06.545
to come see a man
who I've never met or heard of

06:06.547 --> 06:08.547
be executed tonight.

06:08.549 --> 06:10.382
You're perplexed.

06:10.384 --> 06:12.117
And you're Sebastian Wake.

06:12.119 --> 06:14.352
Former East Coast gun for hire.

06:14.354 --> 06:15.687
Convicted of multiple homicides

06:15.689 --> 06:18.023
and suspected
in dozens more.

06:18.025 --> 06:20.225
You don't wear
a hockey mask

06:20.227 --> 06:21.560
or have knives on your fingers

06:21.562 --> 06:24.996
because, well,
you're the real deal.

06:24.998 --> 06:26.965
You've done your homework.

06:26.967 --> 06:29.868
Yeah, well, they had
Wi-Fi on the plane, too.

06:29.870 --> 06:34.039
What I can't wrap my mind
around, though, is, um...

06:34.041 --> 06:38.043
why you demanded to talk to me
before you, uh,

06:38.045 --> 06:41.246
ride the electric horseman
into the afterlife.

06:42.816 --> 06:45.650
You have a wonderful way
with words, Lou.

06:45.652 --> 06:48.587
I'm not a big fan
of wasting time.

06:48.589 --> 06:49.921
That's why,
with so little left,

06:49.923 --> 06:51.556
I thought it prudent
we finally meet.

06:51.558 --> 06:53.658
The local D.A. mentioned
to me something about you

06:53.660 --> 06:54.926
wanting to make
an 11th-hour confession.

06:54.928 --> 06:56.461
Is that the reason I'm here?

06:56.463 --> 06:59.264
Fine, if that's it,
let's get on with it.

06:59.266 --> 07:00.532
Patience, Lou.

07:00.534 --> 07:02.000
All in good time.

07:02.002 --> 07:03.768
But trust me, after we're done,

07:03.770 --> 07:07.072
you're going to be glad
you watched me die.

07:12.946 --> 07:14.913
This guy's name was
Tyler Riggins. Uh...

07:14.915 --> 07:16.448
he had a business
importing livestock

07:16.450 --> 07:18.216
from the mainland--
mostly pigs.

07:18.218 --> 07:20.285
Apparently, he was on his
way to a slaughterhouse

07:20.287 --> 07:22.287
in Kaneohe, uh,
and he texted ahead

07:22.289 --> 07:25.524
saying that his truck
had... had broken down.

07:25.526 --> 07:27.192
Okay.

07:27.194 --> 07:29.828
Well, he has a
close-contact gunshot wound.

07:29.830 --> 07:31.229
I checked his wallet.

07:31.231 --> 07:33.832
His, uh, cash and cards
are still inside.

07:33.834 --> 07:36.935
All right, so, uh,
probably not a robbery.

07:36.937 --> 07:39.804
Uh, my guess--
uneducated at this point--

07:39.806 --> 07:42.307
is that he, uh...

07:42.309 --> 07:44.509
he had somebody mess
with his truck beforehand.

07:44.511 --> 07:47.212
So the killer waits
for him to break down,

07:47.214 --> 07:49.114
get stranded, uh...

07:49.116 --> 07:51.950
Oh, I'm sorry. Do you... .
do you have a theory?

07:51.952 --> 07:53.418
You got a theory? No?
No. No.

07:53.420 --> 07:54.886
Oh, yeah, I see your
wheels spinning.

07:54.888 --> 07:56.588
What-what is it?
Well, I just...

07:56.590 --> 07:59.224
It's just, I have a little...
a case of the willies.

07:59.226 --> 08:01.393
Why? Why do you have
a case of willies?

08:01.395 --> 08:02.827
It's stupid.
Forget it.

08:02.829 --> 08:04.496
No, no, no.
Now I'm very interested.

08:04.498 --> 08:06.164
What?

08:06.166 --> 08:08.366
All right, well, you've
obviously not heard

08:08.368 --> 08:10.669
the tale of Pele
and the Pali Road.

08:10.671 --> 08:12.304
No, I... because
I'm from New Jersey.

08:12.306 --> 08:13.672
So I have not.

08:13.674 --> 08:16.041
Okay. Well, it's an
old Hawaiian myth.

08:17.377 --> 08:20.011
Pele was the goddess of fire.

08:20.013 --> 08:22.581
And she had this
really hot relationship

08:22.583 --> 08:24.950
with a demigod named Kamapua'a.

08:24.952 --> 08:26.084
Ah.

08:26.086 --> 08:28.119
He was half man, half pig.

08:28.121 --> 08:30.622
Top or bottom?
What?

08:30.624 --> 08:32.691
Well, was the top half the pig
or the bottom half?

08:32.693 --> 08:34.058
I-I think it's kinky,
it sounds kinky,

08:34.061 --> 08:35.393
and I like details, so I'm...

08:35.395 --> 08:36.760
I'm interested.

08:36.763 --> 08:38.196
I don't... I don't know.

08:38.198 --> 08:40.599
I don't know.
Okay.

08:40.601 --> 08:41.900
Anyway, their relationship

08:41.902 --> 08:44.198
was full of drama,
and one day they decide to call it quits.

08:44.200 --> 08:46.271
'Cause he's-he's
tracking hoof mud

08:46.273 --> 08:48.206
all through the kitchen
and the living room

08:48.208 --> 08:49.341
like an animal, right?

08:49.343 --> 08:50.342
I get it.

08:50.344 --> 08:51.643
I'm genuinely surprised

08:51.645 --> 08:53.945
that McGarrett
hasn't shot you yet.

08:53.947 --> 08:55.213
He's tried inadvertently.

08:55.215 --> 08:56.514
A bunch of different times.

08:56.516 --> 08:57.983
Anyway, please continue.
I'm riveted.

08:57.985 --> 09:00.018
What, uh... what happened?
They got into a beef?

09:00.020 --> 09:02.554
They never wanted to
see each other again.

09:02.556 --> 09:05.390
They even split
the island in half.

09:05.392 --> 09:07.659
So Kamapua'a got
the Windward side.

09:07.661 --> 09:10.362
And everything
that's now Honolulu is Pele's.

09:10.364 --> 09:12.597
This is a... I mean,
it's a fascinating story,

09:12.599 --> 09:15.233
but what does it have to do
with the... the dead guy?

09:15.235 --> 09:16.935
Well, the legend says
that you're not supposed

09:16.937 --> 09:18.603
to bring pork over the Pali.

09:18.605 --> 09:20.372
Because it'd be like bringing,

09:20.374 --> 09:23.708
uh, Kamapua'a's stuff over
to Pele's turf, right?

09:23.710 --> 09:25.610
Yes. Exactly.
Got it.

09:25.612 --> 09:28.346
And if you do it,
you will break down somewhere,

09:28.348 --> 09:30.582
at which point an old woman
will appear

09:30.584 --> 09:32.717
with a white dog,
and the only way

09:32.719 --> 09:35.587
to safely move on
is if you feed the pork

09:35.589 --> 09:37.722
to the dog.

09:37.724 --> 09:39.751
Do you have any idea
how crazy that sounds?

09:39.775 --> 09:41.093
Yeah, well,

09:41.094 --> 09:42.961
laugh all you want,
but there's dozens of reports

09:42.963 --> 09:44.462
of people just breaking down
mysteriously

09:44.464 --> 09:45.697
on the Pali for no reason.

09:45.699 --> 09:47.766
Yo.

09:47.768 --> 09:49.534
Hey, yo, Uncle D.

09:49.536 --> 09:51.436
D... Uncle Detective Williams.

09:51.438 --> 09:52.937
Uh-huh.

09:52.939 --> 09:54.739
Officer Rey.

09:54.741 --> 09:57.308
<i>Hau'oli La Heleui.</i>

09:57.310 --> 09:59.277
Did he just completely
mangle that or what?

09:59.279 --> 10:00.745
Yeah, I don't know
what he said.

10:00.747 --> 10:02.213
What do you got?
Check it out.

10:02.215 --> 10:04.416
Fresh prints.

10:04.418 --> 10:06.718
These are too small to be
our vic's, so I'm thinking

10:06.720 --> 10:08.953
they belong to our shooter.
Looks like he came

10:08.955 --> 10:10.989
out of the woods,
walked up back behind the truck,

10:10.991 --> 10:12.223
approached
the driver-side window

10:12.225 --> 10:14.459
and pulled the trigger.

10:14.461 --> 10:17.562
Considering shoe size
is generally 15%

10:17.564 --> 10:19.097
of a person's average height,

10:19.099 --> 10:21.066
I'm guessing our shooter
was around five-eight.

10:21.068 --> 10:22.467
Okay. What else?

10:22.469 --> 10:24.703
Uh... oh, yeah,
shooter wasn't alone.

10:24.705 --> 10:26.337
You think there
was an accomplice?

10:26.339 --> 10:28.106
A four-legged one.

10:29.409 --> 10:30.775
I'm sorry?

10:30.777 --> 10:33.011
I found paw prints, too.

10:36.216 --> 10:38.016
What kind of animal?

10:38.018 --> 10:39.851
A dog.

10:49.828 --> 10:51.694
I came as soon as I heard.

10:52.196 --> 10:54.296
What the hell?

10:54.598 --> 10:56.131
Oh...

10:56.133 --> 10:58.300
Why-why, um,
are you dressed

10:58.302 --> 11:00.302
like Marie Antoinette?

11:00.304 --> 11:01.770
Actually, I'm Chevalier Danceny.

11:01.772 --> 11:03.505
Oh. <i>Dangerous Liaisons.</i>

11:03.507 --> 11:05.841
Correct.
Keanu Reeves

11:05.843 --> 11:07.409
played Chevalier in that film.

11:07.411 --> 11:09.278
You-you know that,
uh, that was Max's thing--

11:09.280 --> 11:10.746
dressing up like
Keanu Reeves characters, right?

11:10.748 --> 11:12.781
Right, and before he left,
I made him a vow.

11:12.783 --> 11:14.216
I swore I'd keep up
his tradition.

11:14.218 --> 11:15.918
He said that you
and McGarrett loved it.

11:15.920 --> 11:17.653
Mmm, I don't think
we said that.

11:17.655 --> 11:19.321
But if we did,
we were lying.

11:19.323 --> 11:21.089
And this is
three years ago.

11:21.091 --> 11:23.625
Max dressed up
as Chevalier before?

11:23.627 --> 11:25.627
Three years ago.
Damn.

11:25.629 --> 11:27.062
I knew I should've asked him
for a list.

11:27.064 --> 11:28.096
Okay. What's going on?

11:28.098 --> 11:29.832
Oh. Can you believe it?

11:29.834 --> 11:31.800
Dead driver on the Pali?
This is huge.

11:31.802 --> 11:33.836
Hey, do you mind
if I run point on this?

11:33.838 --> 11:35.370
I mean, it's kind of
in my wheelhouse.

11:35.372 --> 11:37.272
Wait, wh-why is it
your wheelhouse?

11:37.274 --> 11:39.441
'Cause I'm an expert on
Oahu's most haunted places.

11:39.443 --> 11:42.811
Kaimuki House, Kipapa Gulch,
Morgan's Corner, the Pali.

11:42.813 --> 11:44.012
The Pali is...

11:44.014 --> 11:45.447
is not haunted.
Yes, it is.

11:45.449 --> 11:46.849
I know for a fact
the Pali is haunted.

11:46.851 --> 11:48.083
You want to know how I know?

11:48.085 --> 11:49.718
Uh-huh.
1983.

11:49.720 --> 11:51.220
My buddy Gordie Lachance
calls me up.

11:51.222 --> 11:52.654
He's got the new <i>Bantha Tracks.</i>

11:52.656 --> 11:54.556
He says there's
something in it I gotta see.

11:54.558 --> 11:56.792
So I grab my bike,
and I pedal over there.

11:56.794 --> 11:58.760
I take the Pali.
So I'm rocking out,

11:58.762 --> 12:00.996
listening to Journey,
“Separate Ways.”

12:00.998 --> 12:02.231
Definitely my
favorite track

12:02.233 --> 12:03.765
on the <i>Frontiers</i> album.

12:03.767 --> 12:05.334
- Spent six weeks at number eight...
- Jerry!

12:05.336 --> 12:07.703
Right. So, I'm burning rubber.

12:07.705 --> 12:08.937
Got my headlight on.

12:08.939 --> 12:10.072
Then suddenly
the fog rolls in.

12:10.074 --> 12:11.540
I hear static.

12:11.542 --> 12:13.208
Then my headlight goes out.

12:13.210 --> 12:14.877
What's going on?
I don't know.

12:14.879 --> 12:16.512
I hit a pothole.
The chain comes off.

12:16.514 --> 12:18.213
I dismount
to get the chain back on.

12:18.215 --> 12:20.549
I fumble around in the darkness,
and then I hear it.

12:20.551 --> 12:21.583
Growling.

12:21.585 --> 12:23.819
Could be canine.

12:23.821 --> 12:25.954
I'm thinking,
it's getting closer.

12:25.956 --> 12:27.990
Oh, no, this is it.
This is how I end.

12:27.992 --> 12:29.725
What do I do?
And then I remember...

12:29.727 --> 12:32.027
I got the answer
in my fanny pack.

12:34.365 --> 12:37.165
Um, you-you...
you owned a fanny pack?

12:37.167 --> 12:38.567
1983-- they were cool back then.

12:38.569 --> 12:40.202
I don't think fanny packs
were ever really cool.

12:40.204 --> 12:41.870
Ever.
Agree to disagree.

12:41.872 --> 12:43.372
Can I continue with my story?

12:43.374 --> 12:46.341
Sure. So, what was in
your butt bag?

12:46.343 --> 12:47.876
Spam. Good old Spam.

12:47.878 --> 12:50.479
I pop open the can,
I toss it into the fog.

12:50.481 --> 12:51.980
The growling stops.

12:51.982 --> 12:53.649
I get the chain
on my bike,

12:53.651 --> 12:55.384
and I race over
to Gordie's house.

12:55.386 --> 12:57.486
But I never set foot
on the Pali again.

12:57.488 --> 13:00.556
Trust me, that road is cursed.

13:00.558 --> 13:02.491
Dude, you...
you're preaching.

13:02.493 --> 13:03.825
Uh-huh. Okay.

13:03.827 --> 13:05.961
Listen, maybe you had a
supernatural encounter

13:05.963 --> 13:08.096
on the Pali, but our
victim did not. Okay?

13:08.098 --> 13:09.965
The lab said that someone
messed with his truck.

13:09.967 --> 13:11.934
They put diesel in his tank.

13:11.936 --> 13:13.435
Okay?

13:14.305 --> 13:16.471
What's going on?

13:16.473 --> 13:18.840
We, uh... we just caught
another homicide.

13:18.842 --> 13:20.642
What a shock.

13:20.644 --> 13:22.511
Mark my words--
it's gonna be a busy night.

13:22.513 --> 13:26.315
Studies show that violent crimes
spike around Halloween.

13:29.353 --> 13:32.254
You sure I can't
offer you some?

13:32.256 --> 13:34.289
I'm good.

13:39.897 --> 13:42.130
I met this chicken farmer once.

13:42.132 --> 13:44.433
He raised what you call broilers

13:44.435 --> 13:46.301
in these huge,
ammonia-filled,

13:46.303 --> 13:49.871
windowless sheds
with lights on 24-7

13:49.873 --> 13:53.075
to make his birds eat
as often as possible.

13:54.745 --> 13:57.713
But that wasn't enough.

13:57.715 --> 13:59.681
Pumped these animals
with steroids

13:59.683 --> 14:03.118
to make these things huge.

14:03.120 --> 14:05.654
Only problem was,
they kept dying on him.

14:05.656 --> 14:07.956
He had pictures
on his phone.

14:07.958 --> 14:10.125
These things
were freaks of nature.

14:10.127 --> 14:12.694
They went from
zero to 60 so fast,

14:12.696 --> 14:14.896
their hearts
just gave out.

14:16.200 --> 14:18.867
So, naturally,
I asked this fellow,

14:18.869 --> 14:21.503
“Do you hate birds?

14:21.505 --> 14:24.106
“Because I guess you gotta

14:24.108 --> 14:27.676
if you're gonna go into
the chicken-raising business.”

14:30.614 --> 14:33.248
What did he say?

14:34.618 --> 14:37.686
I shot him
before he could answer.

14:38.722 --> 14:41.289
I'm starting to lose patience.

14:41.291 --> 14:43.525
Well, then good thing

14:43.527 --> 14:45.694
we've only got a few hours
on the clock

14:45.696 --> 14:47.429
before we have to end this...

14:47.431 --> 14:48.964
pleasant exchange.

14:48.966 --> 14:51.166
That ain't
what this is.

14:51.168 --> 14:52.834
This is me

14:52.836 --> 14:55.604
sitting around, watching you
consume a 4,000-calorie

14:55.606 --> 14:56.872
fried heart attack.

14:56.874 --> 14:58.140
I'm going to miss your wit.

14:58.142 --> 14:59.975
I don't like my
time wasted.

14:59.977 --> 15:02.344
You're not telling me
what I want to know, I'm done.

15:02.346 --> 15:03.578
Oh, we was right
about you.

15:03.580 --> 15:05.947
Sharp tongue,
short temper.

15:10.621 --> 15:12.854
Last one, buddy.

15:12.856 --> 15:14.623
Who?

15:16.193 --> 15:18.326
Clay Maxwell.

15:22.099 --> 15:24.733
What do you know
about Clay Maxwell?

15:24.735 --> 15:26.401
Your ex-partner, Clay Maxwell.

15:26.403 --> 15:29.805
He told me everything there was
to know about you.

15:31.075 --> 15:32.507
Chicago.

15:32.509 --> 15:33.775
Then Hawaii.

15:33.777 --> 15:37.279
How you accused him
of killing his wife.

15:39.616 --> 15:42.617
He did kill his wife.

15:43.721 --> 15:45.587
And he knew
that you wouldn't stop

15:45.589 --> 15:48.790
looking for evidence
until you proved that he did,

15:48.792 --> 15:51.426
so he hired me to kill you.

15:54.665 --> 15:57.099
His name's Bryan Hansen.

15:57.101 --> 15:58.767
His body was found
partially entombed

15:58.769 --> 16:00.936
in fresh concrete outside
of his home this morning.

16:00.938 --> 16:03.004
There was blunt-force trauma
to the back of the head,

16:03.006 --> 16:05.373
so I'm thinking he was
probably knocked out first,

16:05.375 --> 16:07.109
then submerged in the cement.

16:12.216 --> 16:14.349
He then suffocated
as it dried.

16:14.351 --> 16:16.118
Okay. Time of death?

16:16.120 --> 16:17.252
Around midnight.

16:17.254 --> 16:18.854
Seems, like,
pretty complicated.

16:18.856 --> 16:20.722
Why-why go through
all the trouble?

16:20.724 --> 16:22.691
Well, forgive me
for overstepping,

16:22.693 --> 16:24.292
but I actually think
this homicide

16:24.294 --> 16:26.828
could be connected to the one
on the Pali Highway.

16:26.830 --> 16:28.797
How's that?

16:28.799 --> 16:30.565
You've heard of the Menehune?

16:30.567 --> 16:31.967
I have not. I assume...

16:31.969 --> 16:33.969
Oh, yeah, she has.

16:33.971 --> 16:35.537
In Hawaiian folklore,
the Menehune

16:35.539 --> 16:37.005
were trolls
who inhabited the island

16:37.007 --> 16:38.573
before the first
Polynesian settlers arrived.

16:38.575 --> 16:40.675
Okay. Wh-What's the, uh...?

16:40.677 --> 16:43.245
Well, the Menehune were known
to be expert craftsmen.

16:43.247 --> 16:45.580
They built roads
and temples and fishponds

16:45.582 --> 16:46.848
and houses.

16:46.850 --> 16:49.484
The thing is,
they were very shy.

16:49.486 --> 16:51.086
And legend has it

16:51.088 --> 16:53.255
that if they ever caught anyone
watching them work,

16:53.257 --> 16:56.892
they would turn them
into stone pillars.

16:59.830 --> 17:01.563
Okay. So the idea--

17:01.565 --> 17:04.299
the connection would be
that, uh, both these crimes

17:04.300 --> 17:06.501
were inspired by
Hawaiian folklore, yeah?

17:06.502 --> 17:08.170
Just a shot in the dark.

17:08.172 --> 17:10.872
- I think she's onto something.
- You do?

17:14.511 --> 17:16.310
<i>And you responded</i>

17:16.313 --> 17:17.945
to the defendant's 911 call.

17:17.948 --> 17:19.047
What happened
when you arrived?

17:19.049 --> 17:20.281
I entered the premises

17:20.284 --> 17:22.983
where I discovered
the victim, Dr. Madison Gray,

17:22.986 --> 17:25.619
dead on the floor from a single
gunshot wound to the head.

17:25.622 --> 17:26.988
Did you see a knife?

17:26.990 --> 17:28.290
Yes, sir, I did.

17:28.291 --> 17:29.457
On the butcher block.

17:29.459 --> 17:31.993
The butcher block?

17:31.995 --> 17:34.529
So the knife was not
in the victim's hand.

17:34.531 --> 17:36.164
No, sir.

17:37.234 --> 17:39.234
Where was the defendant?

17:39.236 --> 17:42.537
She was out on the lanai
with her daughter.

17:42.539 --> 17:48.276
How would you describe
the defendant's state of mind?

17:48.278 --> 17:50.145
Danny's up at the house
with Eric right now.

17:50.147 --> 17:53.515
They found footprints that match
the ones that we found

17:53.517 --> 17:55.884
on the Pali Highway.
So Noelani was right.

17:55.886 --> 17:58.353
These two murders are
linked. It's serial.

17:58.355 --> 18:00.455
There's no witnesses
at either scene?

18:00.457 --> 18:03.225
No witnesses, no... no prints,
no DNA, no ballistics, nothing.

18:03.227 --> 18:04.359
So we got zero leads?

18:04.361 --> 18:05.861
Yeah.

18:12.035 --> 18:16.371
Quote, “I need
to report a murder”"

18:16.373 --> 18:18.607
Unquote.

18:18.609 --> 18:20.642
But when you asked her
what had happened,

18:20.644 --> 18:21.877
she claimed
self-defense.

18:21.879 --> 18:23.411
That is correct.

18:23.413 --> 18:26.414
Can you tell us
exactly what she said?

18:26.416 --> 18:27.883
Excuse me, Your Honor.

18:27.885 --> 18:29.351
I apologize for
the interruption.

18:29.353 --> 18:32.654
May we approach?
It's urgent.

18:41.231 --> 18:42.497
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

18:42.499 --> 18:43.832
court is adjourned for the day,

18:43.834 --> 18:45.800
and we will resume
at a later date

18:45.802 --> 18:47.235
to be determined by the court.

18:47.237 --> 18:48.570
Let's go.

18:48.572 --> 18:49.938
Steve, what's going on?

18:49.940 --> 18:51.940
Five-O needs your help.

18:52.709 --> 18:54.843
- Right now?
- Right now.

19:16.283 --> 19:19.284
My father was bald, like you.

19:20.754 --> 19:23.922
I'm told alopecia
skips a generation.

19:23.924 --> 19:26.558
Or perhaps he was just
crazy as cat poop.

19:26.560 --> 19:28.893
Which I hear does not
skip a generation.

19:30.998 --> 19:33.999
That tongue again.

19:34.001 --> 19:38.036
I so wish we had met earlier
in my non-incarcerated life.

19:39.006 --> 19:40.472
I'll be back.

19:40.474 --> 19:42.407
Take your time.

19:55.789 --> 19:57.989
How do I know you're
telling me the truth?

19:57.991 --> 19:59.724
I have proof.

19:59.726 --> 20:02.494
You have proof
that Clay Maxwell

20:02.496 --> 20:04.863
hired you to kill me?

20:04.865 --> 20:07.665
He offered me $250,000
for your life.

20:07.667 --> 20:09.367
Money I can only imagine

20:09.369 --> 20:12.070
he obtained
through ill-gotten gains.

20:13.840 --> 20:15.940
I was arrested for an
earlier indiscretion

20:15.942 --> 20:17.776
before I could fulfill
the contract.

20:17.778 --> 20:19.110
Well, consider
yourself lucky.

20:19.112 --> 20:20.578
The guys he
sent after you,

20:20.580 --> 20:22.113
I put 'em all
in the ground

20:22.115 --> 20:24.516
except one,
and he's at supermax.

20:26.119 --> 20:28.053
Amateurs.

20:28.055 --> 20:29.354
Yeah, well, maybe

20:29.356 --> 20:31.322
I'm just that good.
Or it was luck,

20:31.324 --> 20:33.558
which is bound to run out.

20:33.560 --> 20:37.262
It's why you avoid
the Windy City these days.

20:37.264 --> 20:38.730
Chicago is

20:38.732 --> 20:40.465
a dangerous place for you.

20:40.467 --> 20:42.901
Because your ex-partner
does not want you

20:42.903 --> 20:45.070
to prove he killed his wife.

20:45.072 --> 20:46.337
He said that to you?

20:49.816 --> 20:51.883
That's why you're here, Lou.

20:51.885 --> 20:54.753
Because I'm the only one
who can prove Clay killed Diane.

20:54.755 --> 20:57.756
How can you prove that?

20:57.758 --> 21:01.192
Extend my stay of execution,
and I'll tell you.

21:12.372 --> 21:14.506
What do you think?
Your unsub is smart.

21:14.508 --> 21:15.774
Patient.

21:15.776 --> 21:17.676
One murder
right on top of the other.

21:17.678 --> 21:19.511
Different M.O.'s,
different parts of the island.

21:19.513 --> 21:21.379
No witnesses. This, uh...

21:21.381 --> 21:24.215
this had to be
meticulously planned.

21:24.217 --> 21:27.786
And they're both male,
so that's interesting.

21:27.788 --> 21:29.421
Why is that interesting?

21:29.423 --> 21:31.856
70% of serial killer
victims are female.

21:33.326 --> 21:34.793
And, uh...

21:34.795 --> 21:37.796
they have something
else in common.

21:37.798 --> 21:39.731
They're both white.

21:39.733 --> 21:41.766
Well, he's gone
to great lengths

21:41.768 --> 21:42.967
to make this look

21:42.969 --> 21:45.070
like the work of
Hawaiian spirits,

21:45.072 --> 21:47.238
and he might be trying
to make a statement.

21:47.240 --> 21:48.740
Maybe he's
Hawaiian himself,

21:48.742 --> 21:52.077
got something against
those who aren't.

21:52.079 --> 21:54.112
Steve.
Hmm?

21:54.114 --> 21:56.581
I can't help but
think that maybe

21:56.583 --> 21:59.217
you brought me
onto this case to, um...

21:59.219 --> 22:03.221
stop me from telling the truth
about what happened with Gray.

22:04.791 --> 22:06.858
Well, I'm not that clever.

22:06.860 --> 22:08.626
We really need your help
on this,

22:08.628 --> 22:11.896
because I don't think whoever
killed these two is done.

22:11.898 --> 22:13.031
But hopefully,
with the delay,

22:13.033 --> 22:15.300
I can talk some sense into you.

22:16.837 --> 22:18.203
Hi. Sorry to interrupt.

22:18.205 --> 22:20.538
Eric's here.
He's got something to show us.

22:21.508 --> 22:23.808
All right,
so I did a thorough search

22:23.810 --> 22:27.512
of Bryan Hansen's place,
and I found more footprints--

22:27.514 --> 22:28.680
this time
in the rafters.

22:28.682 --> 22:29.914
Looks like our suspect

22:29.916 --> 22:32.183
must have been up there.
Okay, we got fingerprints?

22:32.185 --> 22:34.819
Negative, but I did
find traces of DNA.

22:34.821 --> 22:37.021
Lab's running it now.

22:37.023 --> 22:39.657
Okay, so our suspect,
he's sitting up there,

22:39.659 --> 22:41.259
he's watching Hansen,
and he is waiting

22:41.261 --> 22:42.961
for the best time to strike.

22:42.963 --> 22:45.029
And I did find
something else.

22:45.031 --> 22:46.364
Something kind of weird.

22:46.366 --> 22:48.066
Moss and seaweed.

22:50.303 --> 22:52.270
Sea... You say seaweed?

22:52.272 --> 22:54.105
Yeah. Not really sure
what the presence

22:54.107 --> 22:56.241
of that stuff means,
if anything, but I figured

22:56.243 --> 22:57.809
I'd better mention it.

22:57.811 --> 23:00.178
Tani, call HPD. Have them send
all available units

23:00.180 --> 23:01.713
to Wahiawa Academy right away.
Yeah, on it.

23:01.715 --> 23:03.381
Right now.
I'll reach out to the administration.

23:03.383 --> 23:05.350
Whoa, what's, uh...
what's going on?

23:05.352 --> 23:07.418
I think there's about
to be a kidnapping.

23:15.562 --> 23:16.828
Hi.

23:32.946 --> 23:35.413
<i>Okay, explain.</i>

23:35.415 --> 23:37.448
All right, look,
it's an old legend--

23:37.450 --> 23:38.650
the Green Lady of Wahiawa.

23:38.652 --> 23:40.151
It's a story about a woman

23:40.153 --> 23:42.120
<i>who took her kids down</i>
<i>to the Wahiawa Gulch.</i>

23:42.122 --> 23:43.755
<i>One of the children</i>
<i>went missing,</i>

23:43.757 --> 23:44.756
and she was never found.

23:44.758 --> 23:45.890
Now, the mom, she died

23:45.892 --> 23:47.959
of heartbreak
soon thereafter.

23:47.961 --> 23:50.195
And legend has it that
the ghost of the mother,

23:50.197 --> 23:53.331
she wanders around Wahiawa
looking for the missing child.

23:53.333 --> 23:56.234
And she grabs any child
that she comes across.

23:56.236 --> 23:58.269
Now, for years,
locals have claimed

23:58.271 --> 24:00.772
to have seen that ghost
at Wahiawa Academy.

24:00.774 --> 24:03.241
She's always covered
in moss and seaweed.

24:04.778 --> 24:06.311
<i>Jerry, what do you got?</i>

24:06.313 --> 24:08.346
HPD's at the school,
but they were too late.

24:08.348 --> 24:09.581
We got a missing girl.

24:09.583 --> 24:11.616
A seven-year-old
named Lacey Bell.

24:11.618 --> 24:13.785
She was outside on the
playground after school waiting

24:13.787 --> 24:16.054
for her nanny to pick her up
when she got snatched.

24:16.056 --> 24:17.889
A MAILE AMBER Alert's
going out.

24:17.891 --> 24:19.958
The good news is she's got
a cell phone with her today.

24:19.960 --> 24:21.192
She's going
trick-or-treating later,

24:21.194 --> 24:22.794
and her mom wanted
to be able track her.

24:22.796 --> 24:24.596
All right, we got a lock
on that cell phone?

24:24.598 --> 24:26.064
I'm working on it.

24:31.037 --> 24:33.371
Okay, got it.

24:33.373 --> 24:34.706
Koko Crater Botanical Garden.

24:47.487 --> 24:49.053
You're close.

24:49.055 --> 24:51.055
Like ten yards.

24:57.664 --> 24:59.364
Got something right here.

24:59.366 --> 25:01.566
Tani, I got something.
Yeah.

25:01.568 --> 25:02.901
Is it Lacey?

25:02.903 --> 25:04.903
No, but it's her backpack.

25:07.274 --> 25:08.506
They're on the move.

25:08.508 --> 25:10.775
So are we. Let's go.

25:37.244 --> 25:39.958
- Hey.
- Hey. HPD questioned everyone

25:39.959 --> 25:41.926
who's been through here
in the last 30 minutes.

25:41.928 --> 25:43.027
Any of them see Lacey?

25:43.029 --> 25:44.429
No, but they
spoke to a hiker

25:44.431 --> 25:46.130
who saw a woman walking
around here earlier.

25:46.132 --> 25:47.331
She was wearing a hoodie.

25:47.333 --> 25:48.866
She looked like
she was in a rush,

25:48.868 --> 25:50.802
but, you know, her hood was up,
her head was down.

25:50.804 --> 25:52.011
They couldn't get
a good look at her face.

25:52.035 --> 25:53.038
Well, I got Jerry.

25:53.039 --> 25:54.539
Just talked to Eric.

25:54.541 --> 25:57.208
Lab got a hit off the DNA
from the second crime scene.

25:57.210 --> 25:58.443
You're not gonna believe this.

25:58.445 --> 26:00.078
It belongs to Marissa Walker.

26:00.080 --> 26:01.813
Marissa Walker?

26:01.815 --> 26:03.614
You sure?
Why? Who is that?

26:03.616 --> 26:05.717
She was a
12-year-old girl

26:05.719 --> 26:07.318
who got abducted
20 years ago.

26:07.320 --> 26:08.519
She was on her way home
from school.

26:08.521 --> 26:10.722
A guy grabbed her.
He dragged her into the forest.

26:10.724 --> 26:13.357
He raped her, tied her to
a tree, and he left her there.

26:13.359 --> 26:14.360
My God.

26:14.384 --> 26:15.961
Yeah, but it
doesn't end there.

26:15.962 --> 26:18.596
While she was tied up,
she got attacked by wild boars.

26:18.598 --> 26:19.997
She suffered
various facial injuries,

26:19.999 --> 26:22.533
which left her
horribly disfigured.

26:23.970 --> 26:26.104
They never caught the guy
responsible, but the papers

26:26.106 --> 26:27.538
were calling her
the Half-Face Girl.

26:27.540 --> 26:30.208
Everybody was treating her
like she was some kind of freak.

26:30.210 --> 26:31.809
Right, Half-Face Girl,
like the legend.

26:31.811 --> 26:33.478
That explains motive.

26:33.480 --> 26:35.413
She's re-creating the legends

26:35.415 --> 26:36.881
as a form of revenge.

26:36.883 --> 26:38.816
How do we find her?
I don't know if we can.

26:38.818 --> 26:40.418
I mean, nobody's
seen Marissa in years.

26:40.420 --> 26:43.321
Is that right, Jerry?
Just pulled up her old case.

26:43.323 --> 26:46.090
She may still have family
on the island. Maybe they know.

26:46.092 --> 26:47.191
Okay, got something.

26:47.193 --> 26:48.526
She's got an older sister

26:48.528 --> 26:49.808
named Hannah, and... Oh, my God.

26:50.308 --> 26:51.573
What?

26:52.343 --> 26:53.543
Guys...

26:53.545 --> 26:55.878
Hannah's married name
is Hannah Bell.

26:55.880 --> 26:57.313
She's Lacey's mom.

26:57.315 --> 27:00.683
Why would Marissa
go after her own niece?

27:00.685 --> 27:02.652
I haven't seen Marissa in years.

27:02.654 --> 27:07.557
She left the house one morning
when she was a teenager,

27:07.559 --> 27:09.592
went into the woods and...

27:09.594 --> 27:11.027
never came out.

27:11.029 --> 27:13.162
I looked for
her for months,

27:13.164 --> 27:14.897
but...

27:14.899 --> 27:17.099
I don't think
she wanted to be found.

27:20.038 --> 27:23.372
This is all my fault.

27:25.143 --> 27:27.109
What do you mean?

27:29.547 --> 27:33.149
There are things
about what happened that...

27:33.151 --> 27:35.718
people don't know about.

27:35.720 --> 27:39.222
Details that never made it
into the newspaper.

27:41.693 --> 27:43.292
The day that Marissa was taken,
I was supposed

27:43.294 --> 27:44.727
to walk home
with her from school,

27:44.729 --> 27:47.129
but I went off with
some friends instead,

27:47.131 --> 27:50.933
and I just told her
to go home by herself.

27:54.038 --> 27:55.905
<i>If I had just been there,</i>

27:55.907 --> 27:57.673
<i>you know, maybe he</i>
<i>would have moved on.</i>

28:02.313 --> 28:04.447
What's she gonna do with Lacey?

28:07.051 --> 28:08.618
We're gonna do
everything we can

28:08.620 --> 28:10.219
to get her back safe, okay?

28:10.221 --> 28:12.321
You have my word.

28:13.191 --> 28:15.758
Steve, can I talk to you?

28:15.760 --> 28:18.194
Excuse us
for a minute, please.

28:19.964 --> 28:21.397
I think that Marissa's done

28:21.399 --> 28:23.232
with the Legend
of the Green Lady.

28:23.234 --> 28:25.468
I think she's moving
on to a new one.

28:25.470 --> 28:27.970
Yeah, the Half-Face Girl.

28:29.307 --> 28:32.275
What if Marissa wants to
take revenge on her sister

28:32.277 --> 28:36.212
by re-creating what happened
to her 20 years ago?

29:02.840 --> 29:05.474
Oh. There, there.

29:05.476 --> 29:07.543
I have to go now.

29:07.545 --> 29:09.545
But you won't
be alone

29:09.547 --> 29:11.414
for very long.

29:16.487 --> 29:18.888
The monsters will be here soon.

29:32.919 --> 29:34.252
Junior, right?

29:34.254 --> 29:35.453
Yeah.

29:35.455 --> 29:36.654
I'm Tani Rey.

29:36.656 --> 29:37.722
I'm with Five-O.

29:37.724 --> 29:39.224
Oh, yeah, right.

29:39.226 --> 29:41.192
Yeah, Commander McGarrett's
mentioned you.

29:41.194 --> 29:43.461
Right. So I guess you're living
with him now?

29:43.463 --> 29:46.831
Yeah, for the time being.
He kind of took me in.

29:46.833 --> 29:48.500
Looking after this guy?

29:48.502 --> 29:49.734
I try to.

29:49.736 --> 29:52.737
So, how long you been
with the unit?

29:52.739 --> 29:54.205
Not long.
Six weeks.

29:54.207 --> 29:57.342
And before that,
you were with, uh, HPD?

29:57.344 --> 29:59.444
The police academy.

29:59.446 --> 30:01.212
Ah, really?

30:01.214 --> 30:02.647
When'd you graduate?

30:02.649 --> 30:04.649
Uh, I didn't really graduate.

30:04.651 --> 30:07.385
It's kind of a long story.
I got kicked out.

30:07.387 --> 30:08.887
Whatever.

30:08.889 --> 30:10.889
Wait. Hang on.

30:10.891 --> 30:13.591
So, you were kicked out
of the police academy,

30:13.593 --> 30:15.960
and then hired by Five-O?

30:17.564 --> 30:20.131
Yeah. Crazy, right?

30:22.702 --> 30:24.669
Yeah. That's crazy.

30:24.671 --> 30:26.504
<i>This is not open</i>
<i>for discussion.</i>

30:26.506 --> 30:28.740
Unfortunately,
your jurisdiction

30:28.742 --> 30:30.063
isn't recognized in
the state of Florida.

30:30.087 --> 30:30.910
Okay, listen, listen.

30:30.911 --> 30:32.944
Then can I spend a couple
more minutes with him?

30:32.946 --> 30:34.579
Just a little more time
with him, please.

30:34.581 --> 30:36.481
There are people
out there, Captain.

30:36.483 --> 30:37.615
Victims of this monster.

30:37.617 --> 30:38.883
You want to go out
there and tell them

30:38.885 --> 30:40.952
you're delaying
their justice?

30:40.954 --> 30:42.854
There was a murder

30:42.856 --> 30:45.223
that I've been trying to crack
for three years.

30:45.225 --> 30:46.891
Sebastian Wake
is the only witness.

30:46.893 --> 30:48.159
I understand.

30:48.161 --> 30:49.527
But have you taken
into account

30:49.529 --> 30:50.862
that he might be lying?

30:50.864 --> 30:53.832
What if he's not?
What if he's not

30:53.834 --> 30:56.367
and this is the only thing
he wants

30:56.369 --> 31:00.038
to get off his chest
before he dies?

31:00.040 --> 31:02.841
I'm sorry.

31:02.843 --> 31:04.976
Sebastian Wake will be
executed at midnight

31:04.978 --> 31:06.778
and not a minute after.

31:13.954 --> 31:15.620
I think I know another way out.

31:15.622 --> 31:17.388
What?
Your trial.

31:17.390 --> 31:19.357
I know another way
out of it.

31:19.359 --> 31:21.226
You want to talk
about this right now?

31:21.228 --> 31:23.761
Just listen to me, all right?
Steve, come on.

31:23.763 --> 31:25.730
We recruited you to help
with the Gray case.

31:25.732 --> 31:28.399
Now, Five-O
has immunity and means.

31:28.401 --> 31:31.769
Your lawyer can argue that you
were still under that umbrella.

31:31.771 --> 31:33.738
My work for Five-O
was over by then,

31:33.740 --> 31:34.487
and we both know it.

31:34.511 --> 31:36.108
And I'd have no problem
telling the judge

31:36.109 --> 31:36.644
you were still working for us.

31:36.668 --> 31:38.544
Steve, I'm not gonna let
you get involved in this.

31:38.545 --> 31:40.011
Hey, listen to me.
You're already involved,

31:40.013 --> 31:41.279
all right, because of me.

31:41.281 --> 31:42.513
It was because of me, Alicia.

31:42.515 --> 31:43.982
I asked for your help.

31:43.984 --> 31:45.250
Don't you remember?

31:45.252 --> 31:46.751
Hey, I recruited you.

31:46.753 --> 31:48.953
Alicia, I brought
you into this.

31:48.955 --> 31:51.356
I'm the one who
asked for your help.

31:51.358 --> 31:53.358
And giving that
almost killed you.

31:53.360 --> 31:55.627
Let me help you.

31:55.629 --> 31:57.462
That's all I'm saying.

31:57.464 --> 32:00.832
Steve, you don't
owe me anything.

32:00.834 --> 32:02.634
You got my daughter back.

32:03.603 --> 32:05.637
I'm not gonna
let you lie for me.

32:05.639 --> 32:06.971
Steve. Hey.

32:08.375 --> 32:09.807
Look.

32:09.809 --> 32:11.242
Hannah Bell said her sister

32:11.244 --> 32:13.711
came in the woods
and never came out, right?

32:17.350 --> 32:19.584
Scary house, Halloween. Great.

32:46.246 --> 32:48.012
Move in.

32:48.014 --> 32:50.081
Please, after you.

33:08.935 --> 33:10.468
My God.

33:12.772 --> 33:15.773
She's re-created her family.

33:20.513 --> 33:21.879
Danny.

33:21.881 --> 33:24.282
I got movement.

33:42.302 --> 33:44.402
Steve. You okay?

33:44.404 --> 33:47.338
Danny, take the ridge
in case she heads to the river.

33:53.847 --> 33:55.847
Think he's got something.

33:57.317 --> 33:59.417
Okay, boy.

34:08.594 --> 34:10.995
Hey, hey. You're okay.
I got you.

34:10.996 --> 34:12.263
You're all right.
You're all right.

34:12.264 --> 34:13.264
You're safe now, okay?

34:13.266 --> 34:14.264
Come here, come here.

34:14.266 --> 34:16.734
You okay? You okay?

34:16.735 --> 34:18.268
You okay?
Are you all right?

34:59.079 --> 35:01.479
Where the hell is she?

35:01.481 --> 35:02.780
Damn it.

35:02.782 --> 35:04.215
Commander, you there?

35:04.217 --> 35:05.349
Yeah, Jerry, go ahead.

35:05.351 --> 35:07.118
We got Lacey.

35:07.120 --> 35:08.386
She's okay.

35:09.456 --> 35:11.189
Thank God.

35:11.191 --> 35:13.925
Okay, look, we,
uh... we just had

35:13.927 --> 35:16.861
a visual on Marissa.
Unfortunately, we lost her.

35:16.863 --> 35:18.563
Okay, I'll lock onto your GPS

35:18.565 --> 35:20.064
and get the dogs over
to your location,

35:20.066 --> 35:21.732
see if they can't pick up
her scent.

35:21.734 --> 35:23.234
All right.

35:23.236 --> 35:25.503
All right, come on.
We'll find her, huh?

35:25.505 --> 35:26.771
I don't know about that.

35:26.773 --> 35:28.506
Okay, saw a trail
20 yards back.

35:28.508 --> 35:29.907
She might have taken it.

35:29.909 --> 35:31.409
Steve, come on.

35:31.411 --> 35:33.277
Yeah.

36:20.727 --> 36:22.760
“They tell me you are wicked

36:22.762 --> 36:24.829
“and I believe them,

36:24.831 --> 36:27.798
“for I have seen
your painted women

36:27.800 --> 36:31.869
“under the gas lamps
luring the farm boys.

36:31.871 --> 36:33.804
“And they tell me
you are crooked

36:33.806 --> 36:37.675
“and I answer:
Yes, it is true,

36:37.677 --> 36:42.079
“for I have seen the gunman kill

36:42.081 --> 36:45.416
and go free to kill again.”

36:51.324 --> 36:53.291
Sebastian Wake.

36:53.293 --> 36:55.493
Any last words?

36:59.432 --> 37:02.767
Boy, am I gonna miss Chicago.

37:19.819 --> 37:21.552
All yours.

37:52.485 --> 37:54.585
He's still alive.

38:05.198 --> 38:07.231
Almost forgot.

38:08.768 --> 38:10.735
This is for you.

38:12.805 --> 38:14.472
What is this?

38:14.474 --> 38:17.375
Sebastian Wake wanted you to
have it after he was gone.

38:18.211 --> 38:19.644
Hmm.

38:19.646 --> 38:21.345
Thank you.

38:38.064 --> 38:39.897
Lacey!

38:58.351 --> 38:59.884
Good job.

38:59.886 --> 39:01.185
Thanks.

39:01.187 --> 39:02.753
Hey.

39:02.755 --> 39:04.588
You, too, buddy boy.

39:06.626 --> 39:08.225
Hey. Come here.

39:08.227 --> 39:09.794
Come on.

39:09.796 --> 39:11.429
My guys scoured the woods.
No sign of Marissa.

39:11.431 --> 39:13.331
All right, I want you guys
back out here first light,

39:13.333 --> 39:14.365
and have CSU
process that house.

39:14.367 --> 39:15.599
You got it.
All right. Hey.

39:15.601 --> 39:17.401
- You all right?
- Yeah.

39:18.271 --> 39:20.304
Hello?

39:21.874 --> 39:24.175
S-Seriously?

39:24.177 --> 39:25.643
You're a hero.

39:25.645 --> 39:27.144
Nah. Eddie here is.

39:27.146 --> 39:29.180
He did all the
heavy lifting.

39:29.182 --> 39:31.082
Yeah.

39:31.084 --> 39:35.152
So, um, how do you feel
about pancakes?

39:35.955 --> 39:37.688
Pancakes?
Yeah.

39:37.690 --> 39:39.123
I love 'em.

39:39.125 --> 39:40.424
Oh, good. Me, too.

39:40.426 --> 39:42.660
We could, uh, split a stack.

39:44.030 --> 39:46.063
You mean, like,
in the morning, right? 'Cause...

39:46.065 --> 39:47.565
No, I don't mean
in the morning.

39:47.567 --> 39:49.567
That was not an invitation
to come home with me.

39:49.569 --> 39:52.536
I meant the Wailana
Coffee House.

39:52.538 --> 39:54.105
The Wailana?

39:54.107 --> 39:56.273
Yeah, it's open 24 hours.

39:56.275 --> 39:57.341
They serve pancakes
all day.

39:57.343 --> 39:58.442
It's the best
on the island.

39:58.444 --> 39:59.810
Sounds good.

39:59.812 --> 40:01.645
I'm in.
Okay.

40:01.647 --> 40:02.780
Good.

40:04.384 --> 40:06.350
Yes. Thank you.

40:08.454 --> 40:10.721
Thank you.

40:10.723 --> 40:14.358
The P.A.'s offered a deal--
18 months probation.

40:14.360 --> 40:16.527
That's it?
Yes, that's it.

40:16.529 --> 40:18.195
That's it? It's over?

40:18.197 --> 40:20.398
Yes.

40:20.400 --> 40:22.466
- It's over.
- That's amazing.

40:22.468 --> 40:24.535
Yeah, I mean,
there are some strings attached.

40:24.537 --> 40:27.738
As part of the probation,
I have to be available if...

40:30.276 --> 40:32.777
...to Five-O as needed.

40:32.779 --> 40:36.147
Right, so we... it's like we got
you on speed dial, right?

40:36.149 --> 40:37.782
Right?
Yeah. Yeah, Danny.

40:37.784 --> 40:39.817
That means you've got me
on speed dial.

40:39.819 --> 40:41.285
Hey, lucky us, huh?

40:41.287 --> 40:44.288
- All right.
- Well, congratulations to you, too.

40:44.290 --> 40:46.223
I'm happy for you.

41:17.723 --> 41:18.889
Steve.

41:18.891 --> 41:20.024
I got your message. What's up?

41:20.026 --> 41:21.859
Listen.

41:21.861 --> 41:23.928
I need you to get in touch
with the Chicago D.A.

41:23.930 --> 41:27.364
He ain't gonna take my call,
but he'll take yours.

41:27.366 --> 41:31.569
I want you to tell him
that we got Clay Maxwell

41:31.571 --> 41:34.104
for murdering his wife.

41:34.941 --> 41:36.207
Wait a minute.

41:36.209 --> 41:38.409
What are you talking about, Lou?
Proof.

41:40.079 --> 41:42.112
Proof, baby.

41:43.716 --> 41:46.650
I got Clay confessing
to killing Diane

41:46.652 --> 41:50.821
and putting a hit on me
because I wouldn't let it go.

41:53.392 --> 41:54.892
All right, buddy.

41:54.894 --> 41:56.560
I'll meet you in Chicago.

41:56.562 --> 41:58.629
Mahalo.
