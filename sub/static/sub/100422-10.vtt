is consistent with the wound.

10:27.059 --> 10:29.527
But given the size and the shape
of the fractured area,

10:29.595 --> 10:33.122
it suggests the blow came
from an overhead swing.

How tall is Rookwood?

10:34.967 --> 10:36.935

10:54.120 --> 10:56.680
lf he was hit from behind
with an overhead swing,

on the back of the head?

But this is an adult shoe.

13:03.215 --> 13:05.809
Yes, but sometimes street

13:05.885 --> 13:06.909

13:06.986 --> 13:08.886
and stuff rags in the toes
to make them fit.

Hence much more weight
in the heel.

14:06.979 --> 14:09.573
Because we have proof
that your shoes were.

14:09.648 --> 14:12.811
How do you suppose they got
there without you in them?

14:14.053 --> 14:15.077
Run !

14:15.821 --> 14:17.686
Oi ! Here!

14:29.401 --> 14:30.766
Come here, you little brat.

14:30.836 --> 14:33.498
Ow! Jesus!

14:33.572 --> 14:34.937
MURDOCH :
l lost them, George.

14:35.007 --> 14:36.998
CRABTREE: They gave me the slip
as well, sir.

14:37.076 --> 14:40.443
l fear our killer
may have gotten away.

14:40.512 --> 14:43.276
l fear he may have done so
on your bicycle, sir.

14:43.349 --> 14:45.374
Oh, for the love of --

14:45.451 --> 14:46.884
Lord's name, sir.

14:48.520 --> 14:51.387
Yes, George, thank you.

15:00.499 --> 15:01.761
BRACKENREl D:
Let me get this straight.

15:01.834 --> 15:04.428
You found the suspects,
you couldn't get them to talk,

15:04.503 --> 15:07.233
they wounded a constable,
nicked a detective's bicycle,

15:07.306 --> 15:08.466
and then got away on it?

15:08.540 --> 15:09.973
Yes, sir.

15:10.042 --> 15:12.010
A stellar performance.

15:12.077 --> 15:13.510
l believe l can identify
the ringleader.

15:13.579 --> 15:14.807
BRACKENREl D:
Well, that's a start.

15:14.880 --> 15:16.279
Any other riveting insights?

15:16.348 --> 15:18.043
Yes, he had an accent.
British.

15:18.117 --> 15:21.211
-Home children.
-Most likely.

15:21.287 --> 15:22.447
Not surprising.

15:22.521 --> 15:24.489
Probably trash off the streets
of East London.

15:24.556 --> 15:26.956
What makes you say that?

15:27.026 --> 15:28.755
Have you ever been to
the East End of London, Murdoch?

15:28.827 --> 15:30.351
No, l haven't.

15:30.429 --> 15:33.398
lt's a filthy, dirty place
full of criminals and derelicts

15:33.465 --> 15:35.729
who do nothing
but drink and breed.

15:35.801 --> 15:36.893
Well, then, sir, l thank God

15:36.969 --> 15:39.199
for places like the
Barnardo Homes and Baker Houses

15:39.271 --> 15:41.262
for rescuing children
from such places.

15:41.340 --> 15:43.968
And sending them to Canada,
where we have to look after 'em.

15:47.413 --> 15:49.347
ls that the little toe rag?

15:53.719 --> 15:56.153
You can see the glint of trouble
in his eye.

15:57.489 --> 15:59.923
Sir, the cards
are without expression.

16:00.492 --> 16:04.223
Oh, it's there, Murdoch.
Look close.

16:07.032 --> 16:09.159
WATT: Sorry, Detective,
l don't know who this is.

16:09.234 --> 16:11.031
l'm afraid they all look
the same to me.

16:11.103 --> 16:12.934
But this boy claims to have
worked here.

16:13.005 --> 16:16.338
That may well be, but it was
Howard who dealt with them.

16:16.408 --> 16:18.535
l don't suppose you have
any employment records?

16:18.610 --> 16:19.872
He paid them in cash.

16:19.945 --> 16:22.470
Enough to put something
in their stomachs.

16:22.548 --> 16:25.244
Do you think this boy was
involved with Howard's death?

16:25.317 --> 16:26.784
lt's very likely.

16:26.852 --> 16:29.013
Those little bastards.

16:29.088 --> 16:31.420
After everything
he did for them.

16:31.490 --> 16:32.457
Do you have any idea

16:32.524 --> 16:34.549
where l might be able to find
these boys?

16:34.626 --> 16:37.186
All l can think of is you
might speak to Calvin Baker.

16:37.262 --> 16:39.696
What does Mr. Baker have to do
with this?

16:39.765 --> 16:41.528
His home
only accommodates girls.

16:41.600 --> 16:45.366
Baker House also has a home
for boys.

16:45.437 --> 16:46.563
lt's in Peterborough.

16:46.638 --> 16:49.072
Now, if there's nothing else...

16:49.141 --> 16:50.870
Actually, there is.

16:50.943 --> 16:53.741
We believe this boy
may be involved

16:53.812 --> 16:55.006
in Mr. Rookwood's murder.

16:55.080 --> 16:56.672
Do you recognize him?

16:56.749 --> 16:58.273
No, sorry.

16:58.350 --> 16:59.681
You barely looked at it.

16:59.752 --> 17:03.483
So many children come through
our doors, Detective.

17:03.555 --> 17:04.749
And l'm in the middle
of organizing

17:04.823 --> 17:06.119
another important fund-raiser.

17:06.191 --> 17:07.282
Well, l'm terribly sorry

17:07.358 --> 17:09.122
if Mr. Rookwood's
murder investigation

17:09.194 --> 17:10.957
is upsetting your schedule.

17:14.599 --> 17:16.464
l'm sorry.
l'll ask my staff.

17:16.535 --> 17:19.299
Perhaps they'll remember him.
May l keep this?

17:19.371 --> 17:20.598
Of course.

17:20.672 --> 17:23.003
Good day, sir.

17:26.545 --> 17:28.843
Miles Gorman's address.

17:28.914 --> 17:31.781
Well done, George.

17:39.258 --> 17:41.192
Mr. Gorman.
Toronto Police.

17:41.260 --> 17:42.852
A word, please.

17:44.196 --> 17:47.461
Oi, Gorman.
Open up.

17:47.533 --> 17:50.161
[ Clinking ]

17:50.235 --> 17:52.430
[ Thudding ]

17:52.504 --> 17:54.028
He appears not to be home.

17:54.106 --> 17:56.131
l guess not, sir.

18:00.679 --> 18:02.943
[ Lock rattling ]

18:06.819 --> 18:09.344
Mr. Gorman, a word.

18:11.156 --> 18:13.090
[ Coughing ]

18:17.362 --> 18:19.830
lt's positively rank in here.

18:19.898 --> 18:20.990
l'm sure you'll be fine.

18:21.066 --> 18:23.933
l'm sure l'll catch glanders
or head lice or some such thing.

18:24.002 --> 18:25.094
You'll catch much worse

18:25.170 --> 18:27.798
if l throw you in the drunk tank
for not cooperating.

18:30.876 --> 18:34.277
Your former employer,
Howard Rookwood, was murdered.

18:34.346 --> 18:36.177
Terrible shame.

18:36.248 --> 18:38.011
Where were you
the night of the murder?

18:38.083 --> 18:41.280
l attended ''The Mikado''
at the opera,

18:41.353 --> 18:45.551
and then l took a spot of
ginger beer at the Rossin House.

18:45.624 --> 18:48.957
Such an extravagant lifestyle
for an unemployed valet.

18:49.027 --> 18:51.359
l save a few pennies
here and there

18:51.430 --> 18:53.421
for some of the finer things
in life.

18:53.499 --> 18:55.660
You were Mr. Rookwood's valet
for four years?

18:55.734 --> 18:57.133
And l must say a superior one.

18:57.202 --> 19:00.171
And what constitutes superior
in the world of valets?

19:00.239 --> 19:03.208
A skilled valet is always
at his employer's service,

19:03.275 --> 19:06.711
conducting himself with
civility, morality, and decency.

19:06.778 --> 19:08.405
And which were you lacking?

19:08.480 --> 19:09.412
l beg your pardon?

19:09.481 --> 19:12.382
When Mr. Rookwood fired you for
theft, which were you lacking?

19:12.451 --> 19:13.918
Civility, morality, or decency?

19:13.986 --> 19:15.613
Those accusations were false.

19:15.687 --> 19:17.552
ltems of value did go missing
from the home?

19:17.623 --> 19:18.647
Yes.

19:18.724 --> 19:19.816
How do you explain that?

19:19.892 --> 19:21.723
There was a boy loitering about.

19:21.793 --> 19:23.385
A boy?

19:24.429 --> 19:26.897
l caught glimpses of him
near the house,

19:26.965 --> 19:28.865
but he vanished
before l could catch him.

19:34.306 --> 19:36.137
ls this the boy?

19:36.208 --> 19:37.766
So, we're back to the boy,
are we?

19:37.843 --> 19:38.775
So it would seem.

19:38.844 --> 19:41.108
Gorman's shoes don't match any
of the ones at the crime scene.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.977
However, he could simply
have disposed of them.

19:43.048 --> 19:45.312
But he spotted the boy loitering
outside the victim's home.

19:45.384 --> 19:47.079
From a place where he was let go
for theft.

19:47.152 --> 19:49.677
-Hardly an impartial witness.
-Suspected theft.

19:49.755 --> 19:51.484
Gorman could be innocent
in all of this.

19:51.557 --> 19:54.151
Yes, but how does a child go
from theft to murder?

19:54.226 --> 19:55.158
l already told you.

19:55.227 --> 19:56.751
Kids like this,
it's in their blood.

19:56.828 --> 19:58.693
-l can't believe that.
-Take my word for it.

19:58.764 --> 20:00.288
Now, what you need to do
is go back to Rookwood House

20:00.365 --> 20:03.732
and see if anyone else
saw this lad hanging around.

20:16.081 --> 20:17.639
MAN :
Whoa!

20:17.716 --> 20:20.150
Thank you.

20:21.119 --> 20:22.950
MAN :
Hyah !

20:27.960 --> 20:30.622
And you say this boy was seen
near the house?

20:30.696 --> 20:32.596
Yes, Mr. Gorman claims to have
recognized him

20:32.664 --> 20:33.596
from this picture.

20:33.665 --> 20:35.724
Hardly a reliable witness.

20:35.801 --> 20:38.235
Nonetheless,
do you recognize him?

20:41.573 --> 20:43.165
Why, that's Charlie.
l'm sure of it.

20:43.242 --> 20:44.436
Eva?

20:44.509 --> 20:45.806
lt is.

20:45.877 --> 20:46.935
Who's Charlie?

20:47.012 --> 20:48.775
Charlie Dunlap.

20:48.847 --> 20:51.873
He's my brother, sir.

20:56.588 --> 20:58.556
He looks older.

21:00.325 --> 21:02.850
Do you think he had something
to do with Howard's death?

21:02.928 --> 21:04.054
Possibly.

21:04.129 --> 21:06.063
We also think he may be involved
in the robberies

21:06.131 --> 21:07.029
here at the home.

21:07.099 --> 21:08.657
There must be some mistake.

21:08.734 --> 21:10.759
lt can't be Charlie.

21:10.836 --> 21:12.736
-Why not?
-lt just can't be!

21:12.804 --> 21:15.398
-Eva.
-Mrs. Rookwood.

21:15.474 --> 21:16.634
l have to see to her.

21:16.708 --> 21:18.972
Just a few more questions,
please.

21:21.513 --> 21:24.607
Clearly, Charlie's not your son,
yet he's Eva's brother?

21:24.683 --> 21:26.446
Eva's adopted.

21:26.518 --> 21:29.419
Her real name is Polly Dunlap.

21:29.488 --> 21:32.685
lf her name is Polly,
why do you call her Eva?

21:32.758 --> 21:35.818
She's named
after our first daughter.

21:35.894 --> 21:37.486
Your first daughter?

21:40.499 --> 21:44.731
She died in an accident
two years ago.

21:44.803 --> 21:46.361
l'm sorry.

21:46.438 --> 21:50.374
l was very lonely afterwards.

21:50.442 --> 21:52.876
Howard suggested a lady's maid.

21:52.944 --> 21:55.640
-So you took in Polly?
-Yes.

21:55.714 --> 21:57.773
From Baker House.

21:57.849 --> 22:01.615
We hired her.
We got close.

22:01.687 --> 22:04.554
Eventually, we adopted her.

22:04.623 --> 22:06.454
And Charlie?

22:07.326 --> 22:09.817
l've only seen him in pictures.

22:10.562 --> 22:13.725
So, you know nothing about him?

22:13.799 --> 22:17.428
l'm sorry.
Eva almost never spoke of him.

22:21.239 --> 22:23.605
l suppose l was trying to forget
about him.

22:23.675 --> 22:26.542
lt was easier than worrying
about what might have happened.

22:26.611 --> 22:29.705
When was the last time
you saw Charlie?

22:29.781 --> 22:31.442
After Father died,

22:31.516 --> 22:34.076
Mother felt she couldn't provide
for us.

22:34.152 --> 22:36.211
So she took Charlie and me
to the Baker House people.

22:36.288 --> 22:37.277
l n London.

22:37.356 --> 22:39.824
They have a home there
where you stay

22:39.891 --> 22:42.155
and a school where they make
sure you can read and write.

22:42.227 --> 22:44.491
And when you were ready,
you were sent here?

22:44.563 --> 22:47.157
They gave us a trunk
for the trip.

22:47.232 --> 22:49.860
l n it was everything
they thought we'd need.

22:49.935 --> 22:53.996
l n mine was a dress, a dolly,
and a Bible.

22:54.072 --> 22:56.472
MURDOCH :
Then you were put on the boat?

22:56.541 --> 22:58.406
Charlie and l had never seen
a boat,

22:58.477 --> 22:59.944
let alone been on one.

23:00.011 --> 23:02.241
None of the children had.

23:02.314 --> 23:04.908
We were all so sick
from the waves.

23:04.983 --> 23:06.712
But then we got used to it.

23:06.785 --> 23:08.810
Things got better.

23:08.887 --> 23:11.822
We saw dolphins and whales
and icebergs.

23:11.890 --> 23:13.983
-The Lord's wonders.
-Yes.

23:14.059 --> 23:16.152
lt was so different than home.

23:16.228 --> 23:18.389
So bright and sunny.

23:18.463 --> 23:21.296
lt all seemed so grand.

23:21.366 --> 23:24.267
But then something happened.

23:24.336 --> 23:26.304
After the boat docked
in Quebec City,

23:26.371 --> 23:28.601
we were put on a train
to Cobourg.

23:28.673 --> 23:30.664
We didn't know anyone.

23:30.742 --> 23:32.710
We missed Mother so.

23:32.778 --> 23:36.646
l was holding Charlie's hand
when we were pulled apart.

23:36.715 --> 23:39.707
And you came here to Toronto,
and he went on to Peterborough.

23:39.785 --> 23:43.414
No one told us
we'd be separated.

23:43.488 --> 23:45.649
We didn't even get to say
goodbye.

23:47.426 --> 23:48.893
And you haven't seen him since?

23:48.960 --> 23:50.052
No.

23:50.629 --> 23:54.326
lf Charlie was here,
why wouldn't he come see me?

23:59.204 --> 24:01.035
What do you have for me, George?

24:01.106 --> 24:03.165
Charlie Dunlap stayed

24:03.241 --> 24:04.708
at the Baker House for Boys
in Peterborough

24:04.776 --> 24:05.640
for about eight months.

24:05.710 --> 24:07.439
He was placed with a family,

24:07.512 --> 24:08.877
but vanished
about six months ago.

24:08.947 --> 24:10.437
Roughly when the robberies
started to occur

24:10.515 --> 24:11.880
at the Rookwood home.

24:11.950 --> 24:14.111
Now, by my way of thinking,
that's far too coincidental.

24:19.057 --> 24:20.319
Wouldn't you agree, sir?

24:47.118 --> 24:50.019
[ Horses neighing,
hooves clopping ]

24:56.027 --> 25:00.088
George, we'll need to return
to the scene of the crime.

25:00.165 --> 25:01.894
-We will?
-Yes.

25:01.967 --> 25:03.935
And we'll need the shoeprint
impression kit again.

25:04.002 --> 25:05.492
Sir, we've taken casts
of all the prints.

25:05.570 --> 25:07.731
Not all of them.

25:10.242 --> 25:12.233
BRACKENREl D: A hoofprint?
And this proves what?

25:12.310 --> 25:13.641
That there were horses
at a glue factory?

25:13.712 --> 25:16.647
Wearing horseshoes, sir.

25:16.715 --> 25:18.205
Horseshoes.

25:18.283 --> 25:20.843
Why would anyone waste
a perfectly good horseshoe

25:20.919 --> 25:21.943
on a nag?

25:22.020 --> 25:23.544
Exactly.
And if that's the case,

25:23.622 --> 25:25.112
what were healthy horses
doing there?

25:25.190 --> 25:27.624
Stolen.
All right, l see your point.

25:27.692 --> 25:29.557
Something's going on
at the glue factory.

25:29.628 --> 25:31.118
But what's it got to do
with this case?

25:31.196 --> 25:33.323
That's what l intend
to find out.

25:35.600 --> 25:38.569
Several shoed horses were sent
to your rendering vats.

25:40.071 --> 25:41.629
Obviously,
there's been a mistake.

25:41.706 --> 25:44.231
Why would a glue factory
be slaughtering

25:44.309 --> 25:46.038
perfectly healthy animals?

25:46.111 --> 25:48.341
ls it because
you were buying stolen ones

25:48.413 --> 25:49.539
for virtually nothing?

25:49.614 --> 25:50.546
Absolutely not.

25:50.615 --> 25:52.742
Tell me,
did you steal them yourself,

25:52.817 --> 25:55.411
or did you engage others
to steal them for you?

25:55.487 --> 25:56.886
Perhaps street children.

25:56.955 --> 26:00.356
l think this meeting is over,
sir, unless l'm under arrest.

26:00.425 --> 26:01.551
No.

26:01.626 --> 26:02.650
But consider this.

26:02.727 --> 26:05.753
Last year, a man in Wyoming
was caught stealing horses.

26:05.830 --> 26:08.390
The courts would have given him
jail time,

26:08.466 --> 26:11.162
but, sadly, his neighbors
got to him first.

26:15.073 --> 26:17.439
lt was Howard's idea
to use the children.

26:17.509 --> 26:20.239
The boy.
Where do l find him?

26:20.312 --> 26:21.779
l don't know.

26:21.846 --> 26:24.872
As l told you, it was Howard
who dealt with them.

26:24.950 --> 26:27.976
l never thought
it would end like this.

26:28.053 --> 26:30.214
Never.

26:30.288 --> 26:32.552
CRABTREE: l nspector,
l believe l've come up

26:32.624 --> 26:33.556
with a plan of attack.

26:33.625 --> 26:34.819
BRACKENREl D:
Have you now?

26:34.893 --> 26:38.158
Ah, your protégé's been thinking
again, Murdoch.

26:38.229 --> 26:39.161
lt's dangerous.

26:39.230 --> 26:41.391
There have been
16 reported horse thefts

26:41.466 --> 26:42.899
in the last five months.

26:42.968 --> 26:44.401
All of which have taken place

26:44.469 --> 26:48.701
within a 2-mile radius
of the glue factory.

26:49.808 --> 26:53.574
Now, the first question is
''When do they strike?''

26:53.645 --> 26:55.442
Every 10th night.

26:55.513 --> 26:57.708
Tonight is the 10th night.

26:57.782 --> 27:02.276
The second question, obviously,
is ''Where?''

27:02.354 --> 27:04.083
Now, there are only two barns.

27:04.155 --> 27:05.645
-Two what?
-Barns.

27:05.724 --> 27:06.952
-Barns.
-Oh, barns, yeah.

27:07.025 --> 27:12.190
Two stables within this target
area that have not yet been hit.

27:12.263 --> 27:15.699
Right here and here.

27:15.767 --> 27:20.170
Now, l propose we stake out
these two locations.

27:20.238 --> 27:22.433
Wait for the perpetrators
to strike.

27:22.507 --> 27:24.839
Let me get this straight.

27:24.909 --> 27:27.537
You're suggesting
we stake out a location

27:27.612 --> 27:29.375
where something might happen?

27:29.447 --> 27:31.381
Yes.

27:31.449 --> 27:33.576
Brilliant.

27:33.652 --> 27:37.053
George, perhaps we should work
from what we already know.

27:37.122 --> 27:38.214
Such as?

27:38.289 --> 27:39.813
Well, we know for certain

27:39.891 --> 27:42.519
where the stolen horses
will end up, don't we?

27:43.561 --> 27:46.155
-The glue factory.
-BRACKENREl D: Yes.

27:46.231 --> 27:48.665
That's good work anyway, George.

27:48.733 --> 27:50.098
BRACKENREl D:
Good work?

27:50.168 --> 27:52.932
You're going to turn him
into another bloody Murdoch.

27:58.910 --> 28:00.468
Bloody hell, this thing's heavy.

28:00.545 --> 28:01.773
Mm-hmm.

28:01.846 --> 28:04.781
Sir, may l ask you a question?

28:04.849 --> 28:05.713
What?

28:05.784 --> 28:08.048
From the beginning
of this investigation,

28:08.119 --> 28:10.713
you've been singularly hard
on these children.

28:10.789 --> 28:12.814
-No, l haven't.
-Yes, sir, you have.

28:12.891 --> 28:14.620
You've assumed their guilt
right from the start.

28:14.693 --> 28:16.684
These children are given
every chance in the world

28:16.761 --> 28:17.887
and look what they do with it.

28:17.962 --> 28:19.589
They live in abject poverty.

28:19.664 --> 28:21.825
They're torn from their parents,
shipped to another country.

28:21.900 --> 28:23.731
What about the kids
who aren't quite poor enough?

28:23.802 --> 28:25.360
Whose parents work themselves
into an early grave?

28:25.437 --> 28:26.369
What do they do?

28:26.438 --> 28:27.564
l don't know.

28:27.639 --> 28:29.436
They pack school in
after 3 years

28:29.507 --> 28:31.600
and start work to support
four brothers,

28:31.676 --> 28:32.768
that's what they do.

28:38.516 --> 28:39.915
Aye, aye.

28:39.984 --> 28:41.611
What have we got here?

28:46.391 --> 28:47.323
MURDOCH :
That's Charlie.

28:47.392 --> 28:49.155
You nick Charlie,
and l'll grab the others.

28:49.227 --> 28:51.354
And don't let him get away
this time.

29:47.085 --> 29:48.484
CHARLl E:
What did you bring me?

29:48.553 --> 29:50.487
Charlie.

29:50.555 --> 29:52.785
[ Whispering ]

30:07.739 --> 30:09.229
BRACKENREl D:
Well?

30:09.307 --> 30:12.105
l compared the boy's shoes
to the castings we took.

30:12.177 --> 30:13.109
They match.

30:13.178 --> 30:14.805
So he was at the crime scene.

30:14.879 --> 30:16.744
And his sister lied to you

30:16.815 --> 30:18.373
about not knowing
where her brother was.

30:18.449 --> 30:20.883
Clearly, they were robbing
the family home.

30:20.952 --> 30:22.749
But why murder Mr. Rookwood?

30:22.821 --> 30:24.482
That's what
we're about to find out.

30:24.556 --> 30:28.322
This little toe rag's
about to get an eye-opening.

30:30.461 --> 30:32.588
l want to speak with my sister,
sir.

30:32.664 --> 30:34.859
''Sir. ''
You have to talk to me first.

30:34.933 --> 30:37.265
Start with Rookwood.
Did you kill him?

30:37.335 --> 30:38.267
No, sir.

30:38.336 --> 30:39.928
Your footprints were found
all around his body.

30:40.004 --> 30:41.904
Funny that.
How'd they get there? By magic?

30:41.973 --> 30:43.770
-l don't know.
-Well, how about this, then?

30:43.842 --> 30:45.673
You went to rob him, smacked him
on the back of the head.

30:45.743 --> 30:46.835
He died.
You ran.

30:46.911 --> 30:49.004
-That's not how it happened !
-Then how did it?

30:49.080 --> 30:52.208
The lads and me
was bringing a horse back.

30:52.283 --> 30:53.341
Rookwood was lying there.

30:53.418 --> 30:55.716
We thought he was passed out
drunk, so we rolled him.

30:55.787 --> 30:57.618
-Was your sister involved?
-No.

30:57.689 --> 31:00.021
Really? Because we know
you're a little tea leaf.

31:00.091 --> 31:01.718
And, clearly,
it runs in the family.

31:01.793 --> 31:03.226
-You take that back!
-Or what?

31:03.294 --> 31:04.659
Or l'll take a round out of you.

31:04.729 --> 31:06.697
-Oh, will you, now?
-Sir.

31:07.665 --> 31:08.757
[ Clears throat ]

31:08.833 --> 31:10.562
Take a seat.

31:11.970 --> 31:14.530
Let's start at the beginning,
shall we?

31:14.606 --> 31:17.439
How did you get
out of your placement?

31:17.508 --> 31:19.305
l was sent to this farm.

31:19.377 --> 31:21.538
They made me work
until my hands bled.

31:21.613 --> 31:23.945
They wouldn't let me eat
with their children

31:24.015 --> 31:25.505
and made me sleep in the barn.

31:25.583 --> 31:28.211
So one day,
l just left to find Polly.

31:28.286 --> 31:29.480
How did you find her?

31:29.554 --> 31:32.284
l knew she was in Toronto,
so l made my way here.

31:32.357 --> 31:34.621
But l didn't know where to look.
lt's a big city.

31:34.692 --> 31:35.624
Then what did you do?

31:35.693 --> 31:37.752
l heard about this factory
where lads like me

31:37.829 --> 31:38.955
could make an honest buck.

31:39.030 --> 31:40.088
And a dishonest one.

31:40.164 --> 31:42.359
They thought the horses up,
not me.

31:42.433 --> 31:43.400
Right, then.

31:43.468 --> 31:46.164
So, you were working
in the factory.

31:46.237 --> 31:48.068
One day, a carriage rolls up

31:48.139 --> 31:50.733
and, through the window,
l see Polly,

31:50.808 --> 31:52.901
only she's all swank.

31:52.977 --> 31:54.569
So l followed her home.

31:54.646 --> 31:57.376
You must have been surprised to
see her in all that fancy setup.

31:57.448 --> 32:00.440
l was happy for her, sir,
but l was hungry.

32:00.518 --> 32:02.452
She started to bring me food
from the house.

32:02.520 --> 32:04.715
And then you wanted more, maybe?
You got greedy.

32:04.789 --> 32:06.552
Got her to steal stuff
from the house.

32:06.624 --> 32:07.556
That's not true!

32:07.625 --> 32:10.594
Charlie,
l'm sure that you are not bad,

32:10.662 --> 32:14.063
and l don't think
your sister Polly is either.

32:14.132 --> 32:16.657
But a man did get fired
because of you.

32:16.734 --> 32:20.795
l know it's wrong,
but we needed the money.

32:20.872 --> 32:22.772
So Polly took little things
from the house

32:22.840 --> 32:24.068
and gave them to me to pawn.

32:24.142 --> 32:26.667
Your sister wanted for nothing.
Why would she need money?

32:26.744 --> 32:27.938
We were planning to run away.

32:28.012 --> 32:29.206
From all that luxury?

that house, away from him.

-Mr. Rookwood.

Was he beating her?

32:38.089 --> 32:39.681
No.

32:40.558 --> 32:42.617
Not like that.

32:50.735 --> 32:52.726
You have to tell me the truth,
Polly.

32:52.804 --> 32:55.238
Because it's not looking good
for your brother.

32:55.306 --> 32:57.399
We think he killed your father.

32:57.475 --> 32:59.466
That man wasn't my father.

33:00.878 --> 33:02.971
My father is dead and buried.

33:04.649 --> 33:06.583

33:21.132 --> 33:25.569
At first, it was just the way
he looked at me.

And then it got worse.

He came into my room one night.

33:57.735 --> 33:59.794
How could the mother
let that go on?

33:59.871 --> 34:01.133
Maybe she didn't know.

34:01.205 --> 34:02.968
She couldn't have been
that naive.

34:03.041 --> 34:05.271
Perhaps she was too frightened
to do anything.

She could have been in on it.

How dare you treat my daughter

She claims he made advances
on her.

35:17.615 --> 35:20.914
That is a monstrous thing to say
about my husband.

So, now your daughter is a liar
as well as a thief?

35:23.521 --> 35:25.079
How dare you?

35:25.156 --> 35:27.056
Mrs. Rookwood...

35:28.860 --> 35:31.624

what you're looking for, sir.

36:04.195 --> 36:08.393
Yes, this is precisely
what l'm looking for.

36:24.215 --> 36:27.878
Well, cigars, steak, fine wine.

36:27.952 --> 36:29.579
To what do l owe this pleasure?

36:32.590 --> 36:33.614
Bank statements?

36:33.691 --> 36:35.215
Howard Rookwood's
bank statements.

36:35.293 --> 36:36.225
Your point?

36:36.294 --> 36:39.127
Howard Rookwood had been
withdrawing $50 a month

36:39.197 --> 36:40.129
for some time.

36:40.198 --> 36:41.392
Coincidentally,

36:41.465 --> 36:44.525
the same amount had been being
deposited into your account.

36:44.602 --> 36:46.331
You were blackmailing him,
weren't you?

36:46.404 --> 36:48.668
That's how you could afford
this lavish lifestyle.

36:48.739 --> 36:49.933
Why are you wasting my time?

36:50.007 --> 36:52.532
You knew he had a proclivity
for young girls, didn't you?

36:52.610 --> 36:54.475
Probably starting
with his own daughter,

36:54.545 --> 36:56.069
but certainly
with his adopted one.

36:56.147 --> 36:58.081
-What of it?
-''What of it?''

36:58.149 --> 37:00.413
How many wealthy households
do we both know

37:00.484 --> 37:03.214
where the master takes advantage
of his station?

37:03.287 --> 37:06.916
A maid, a cook, a daughter.

37:06.991 --> 37:08.720
So you admit
to blackmailing him, then?

37:08.793 --> 37:09.725
Yes.

37:09.794 --> 37:13.252
But let me give you a little
lesson in blackmail, Detective.

37:13.331 --> 37:17.199
You must have something
truly damaging on your victim

37:17.268 --> 37:19.668
in order to make him pay.

37:32.149 --> 37:34.845
So, Eva Rookwood.
14 years.

37:34.919 --> 37:36.181
Cause of death?

37:36.254 --> 37:38.950
A broken neck incurred during
a fall down the stairs.

37:39.023 --> 37:40.888
Stairs.
Most convenient.

37:40.958 --> 37:43.688
Bruising to the temporal lobe,
thighs, back.

37:43.761 --> 37:45.661
Gorman claims he suffocated her.

37:45.730 --> 37:47.994
ls there anything
to support that?

37:48.633 --> 37:50.260
There's petechial hemorrhaging.

37:50.334 --> 37:52.268
That would be consistent
with suffocation.

37:52.336 --> 37:55.669
So, Howard Rookwood
was molesting his own daughter.

37:55.740 --> 37:57.037
He then killed her.

37:57.108 --> 37:59.338
And later brought another girl
into the home.

37:59.410 --> 38:00.877
Starts all over again.

38:00.945 --> 38:05.006
Are you suggesting that he would
have killed Polly as well?

38:05.082 --> 38:06.572
lt's a reasonable extrapolation.

38:06.651 --> 38:08.846
Well, the killer
certainly wasn't Mr. Gorman.

38:08.919 --> 38:10.386
Why kill your blackmail victim?

38:10.454 --> 38:12.684
And you seem to have ruled out
the children.

38:12.757 --> 38:14.691
That leaves only...

38:17.728 --> 38:20.697
You knew what Howard
was doing to Polly.

38:20.765 --> 38:22.255
Howard doted on that child.

38:22.333 --> 38:24.460
And what about
your first daughter?

38:24.535 --> 38:26.025
Did he dote on her as well?

38:26.103 --> 38:31.336
l will not defile my daughter's
name by talking about this.

38:31.409 --> 38:32.501
You knew he killed her,
didn't you?

38:32.576 --> 38:33.508
No.

38:33.577 --> 38:35.408
You were worried he was going
to do the same thing to Polly,

38:35.479 --> 38:36.411
weren't you?

38:36.480 --> 38:38.175
This is ridiculous.

38:38.249 --> 38:40.274
MURDOCH :
All right.

38:42.753 --> 38:44.220

38:52.596 --> 38:55.690

of your husband's murder.

38:55.766 --> 38:57.393
At first l thought it was
a child's boot,

38:57.468 --> 39:00.266
but you have very small feet.

39:04.542 --> 39:06.772
You were there that night.

39:06.844 --> 39:08.812
You killed your husband.

39:10.748 --> 39:13.182
The doctor said Eva's death
was an accident.

39:13.250 --> 39:15.684
But you knew something
wasn't quite right.

39:17.154 --> 39:19.452
l suspected.

39:19.523 --> 39:22.890
And, still, you took
in Polly Dunlap?

39:22.960 --> 39:27.363
l was so distressed
after Eva's death.

39:31.736 --> 39:36.173
lt was Howard's idea
to procure a girl.

39:36.240 --> 39:39.232
lt was his idea to adopt her
as well.

39:39.310 --> 39:41.744
Everything was his idea.

39:44.081 --> 39:47.539
What happened
after the fund-raiser?

39:50.588 --> 39:53.648
Howard took us back
to the house.

39:53.724 --> 39:58.684
He wanted to say good night
to Eva before he went to work.

39:58.763 --> 40:00.663
He told me to go to bed.

40:00.731 --> 40:02.062
But you didn't.

40:03.501 --> 40:06.766
l'd noticed
how he looked at her.

40:08.038 --> 40:10.268
So l waited.

40:10.341 --> 40:12.536
And l followed him.

40:13.744 --> 40:16.508

40:29.427 --> 40:31.156
l couldn't let him do it again.

40:31.228 --> 40:33.389
So you followed him
