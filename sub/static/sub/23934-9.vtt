Your situation needs to be
handled with discretion.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.721
<i>Look at the intelligence structure
that you've put together.</i>

00:15.390 --> 00:16.972
<i>Should you hand over
the keys to this house</i>

00:17.059 --> 00:18.516
<i>so soon after its construction?</i>

00:18.644 --> 00:20.510
VINCE: <i>They sent a fucking cable</i>

00:20.604 --> 00:23.347
<i>saying that this guy is
coming into our country.</i>

00:23.440 --> 00:25.227
Fifty-three people from the CIA
have read it.

00:25.317 --> 00:28.435
- We're not sharing this yet?
- Vince, you got to trust the process.

00:28.529 --> 00:30.316
Diane will tell us when we can share.

00:30.405 --> 00:33.113
They're not passing anything on.
They're saying it's not pertinent.

00:33.367 --> 00:35.859
"Not pertinent"?
What the fuck does that mean?

00:35.994 --> 00:38.077
<i>If they've got something,
it's pertinent.</i>

00:38.163 --> 00:40.906
DIANE: <i>Yes, I saw Agent Soufan's cable.</i>

00:41.083 --> 00:42.494
MAUREEN:
<i>We were wondering if you'd like us</i>

00:42.584 --> 00:44.917
to pull the relevant intel,
draft a response.

00:45.337 --> 00:49.502
DIANE: <i>Let's find out why
I-49 wants this information,</i>

00:49.591 --> 00:50.923
and we'll go from there.

00:51.510 --> 00:52.500
Sound good?

00:53.095 --> 00:56.338
- You recognize any of these goobers?
- Nope. Who are they?

00:56.723 --> 00:58.840
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

00:59.184 --> 01:01.517
No, they just want me
to see if you guys know.

01:01.687 --> 01:04.599
- Anything to add, George?
- No.

01:05.524 --> 01:07.811
I'd like to say that covers it,
but when can we ever say that?

01:08.569 --> 01:11.027
We never can say that,
which is why we keep working.

01:12.364 --> 01:14.777
You reported directly
to President Clinton, did you not?

01:14.866 --> 01:15.856
I did.

01:15.951 --> 01:18.284
You won't be needed
to report directly to President Bush.

01:26.503 --> 01:28.711
QAMISH: (IN ENGLISH) <i>You think flattery
will get you Abu Jandal?</i>

01:29.006 --> 01:29.996
It will not.

01:30.257 --> 01:31.839
Why can't I speak to him?

01:32.175 --> 01:33.461
Because there is no need.

01:33.719 --> 01:36.177
<i>The New York Times</i>
is gonna publish a story on you.

01:36.471 --> 01:38.963
- So, kill it.
- You need to resign.

01:39.308 --> 01:41.675
I've been here 25 years.

01:42.185 --> 01:43.596
You need to resign today.

worrying about right now,

01:52.404 --> 01:56.774
<i>Because the President has told me
he has no interest in swatting flies.</i>

It appears we've lost our two Saudis,
al-Mihdhar and al-Hazmi.

02:24.728 --> 02:26.094
I thought responsible eyes were on them.

02:26.188 --> 02:27.178
I thought so, too.

02:27.272 --> 02:29.184
These guys are obviously
craftier than we thought.

02:31.485 --> 02:32.475
Hmm.

02:37.658 --> 02:38.648
Interesting.

02:41.411 --> 02:43.152
You know the definition of art?

02:47.125 --> 02:49.458
Boiled spaghetti thrown
against a clean white wall.

02:49.920 --> 02:50.910
Add sauce.

02:51.254 --> 02:54.167
It's the expression
or application of human creative skill

02:55.300 --> 02:56.586
and imagination.

02:56.843 --> 02:58.960
And you might be the most
artistic person I know.

03:28.667 --> 03:30.374
On March 5th of 2000,

03:30.460 --> 03:33.328
the CIA learns that Hazmi
had entered the United States

03:33.422 --> 03:35.004
on January 15th,

03:35.882 --> 03:39.125
seven days after leaving
the al-Qaeda meeting in Malaysia.

03:40.011 --> 03:42.594
But the CIA still doesn't put him

03:42.681 --> 03:43.967
or Mihdhar on the watch list,

03:44.641 --> 03:47.884
and still doesn't notify the FBI
about a very critical fact.

03:49.146 --> 03:50.978
A known al-Qaeda operative...

03:51.064 --> 03:54.182
We're at war with al-Qaeda.
A known al-Qaeda operative

03:54.943 --> 03:56.434
got into the United States.

03:56.528 --> 04:00.272
My question is,
do you know specifically why

04:00.407 --> 04:04.367
the FBI wasn't notified about
that critical fact at that time?

04:05.162 --> 04:07.154
The cable that came in from the field

04:07.247 --> 04:09.785
at that time, sir, was labeled
"information only,"

04:09.875 --> 04:11.332
and I know nobody read that cable.

04:11.418 --> 04:14.456
But my question is,
do you know why the FBI

04:14.546 --> 04:17.914
was not notified to the fact
that this al-Qaeda operative

04:18.007 --> 04:20.466
was now known,
in March of the year 2000,

04:20.552 --> 04:21.884
to have entered the United States?

04:22.053 --> 04:25.637
Why did the CIA
not specifically notify the FBI?

04:25.724 --> 04:28.182
Sir, if we weren't aware of it
when it came into headquarters,

04:28.268 --> 04:29.975
we couldn't have notified them.

04:30.061 --> 04:32.724
Nobody read that cable in March...
In the March time frame.

04:32.814 --> 04:35.022
So that this cable that said
that this al-Qaeda operative

04:35.108 --> 04:36.440
came into the United States

04:36.568 --> 04:38.730
came to your headquarters,
nobody read it.

04:39.196 --> 04:42.530
It was an "information only"
cable from the field,

04:42.616 --> 04:44.903
and nobody read that
"information only" cable.

04:45.160 --> 04:47.903
- Should it have been read?
- Yes, of course, in hindsight.

04:48.163 --> 04:50.280
And should it have been read
at the time?

04:50.916 --> 04:52.703
Of course it should have
been read at the time.

04:52.793 --> 04:55.160
All right, so my question is,
do you know who should have read it?

04:55.796 --> 04:57.458
I don't know that, sir,
but I can find out...

04:57.547 --> 04:59.163
Was somebody responsible
to have read it?

04:59.257 --> 05:01.294
Well, a group of people.
Somebody should have read it.

05:01.384 --> 05:02.420
Yes, sir.

05:02.511 --> 05:05.049
We need to also look at

05:05.138 --> 05:07.004
where it came in to, but I can
find that out for you.

05:07.098 --> 05:08.555
You don't know who that person was?

05:08.642 --> 05:10.429
- No, I do not.
- Should they've been watch-listed?

05:10.519 --> 05:11.805
At the time? Both of them?

05:11.895 --> 05:13.636
Now we're talking
March of the year 2000.

05:14.189 --> 05:15.851
Yes, sir, we've acknowledged that fact.

05:16.191 --> 05:18.774
Do we know why, at that specific time,

05:19.152 --> 05:20.984
now we know that Hazmi
has entered the United States,

05:21.071 --> 05:22.653
- this is another trigger point...
- GEORGE: Yes, sir.

05:22.739 --> 05:24.025
They should've been watch-listed.

05:24.115 --> 05:25.481
Who was responsible

05:25.951 --> 05:27.237
for watch-listing at the time?

05:28.328 --> 05:29.910
I don't know the answer to that,

05:29.996 --> 05:32.079
but I will provide an answer.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.742
- Good morning, Dr. Rice.
- Good morning.

05:36.127 --> 05:37.493
I want to ask you some questions

05:37.587 --> 05:41.080
about the August 6th, 2001,
President's Daily Brief.

05:42.551 --> 05:44.133
You've said to us that the President

05:44.427 --> 05:47.170
directed the CIA
to prepare the August 6th PDB.

05:47.639 --> 05:50.757
The extraordinarily high
terrorist-attack threat level

05:50.851 --> 05:53.810
in the summer of 2001
is well-documented.

05:54.354 --> 05:56.846
You acknowledge that
Richard Clarke told you

05:56.940 --> 05:59.557
that al-Qaeda cells
were in the United States.

06:00.569 --> 06:04.188
Did you tell the President at any time
prior to August 6th

06:04.739 --> 06:08.073
of the existence of al-Qaeda cells
in the United States?

06:09.411 --> 06:12.529
Um, first, let me just make certain...

06:12.622 --> 06:13.908
If you could just answer that question,

06:13.999 --> 06:15.615
because I only
have a very limited amount of time here.

06:15.834 --> 06:17.120
Did you tell the President?

06:17.210 --> 06:18.951
(AUDIENCE CLAPPING)

06:19.087 --> 06:20.749
No, no, please. Please.

06:21.756 --> 06:24.715
Commissioner, it's important
that I also address

06:24.801 --> 06:27.009
the other issues that you have raised.

06:27.095 --> 06:28.381
If you will just give me a moment...

06:28.471 --> 06:30.804
Well, my only question to you
is whether you told the President...

06:30.891 --> 06:34.134
If you will just give me a moment,
I will address fully

06:34.227 --> 06:35.468
the questions that you have asked.

06:35.687 --> 06:37.394
First of all, yes,

06:37.731 --> 06:40.223
the August 6th PDB

06:40.317 --> 06:43.776
was in response to questions
from the President.

06:43.862 --> 06:47.856
There was no recommendation
that we do something about this,

06:47.949 --> 06:50.157
the FBI was pursuing it.

06:50.243 --> 06:52.280
I really don't remember

06:52.746 --> 06:54.533
whether I discussed this
with the President.

06:54.831 --> 06:57.039
- Thank you.
- I remember very well

06:57.125 --> 06:58.991
that the President was aware

06:59.127 --> 07:01.335
that there were issues
inside the United States.

07:01.588 --> 07:03.204
He talked to people about this.

07:03.590 --> 07:05.673
But I don't remember the al-Qaeda cells

07:05.759 --> 07:08.752
as being something we were told
we needed to do something about.

07:09.095 --> 07:12.429
KEARNS: Isn't it a fact, Dr. Rice,
that the August 6th PDB

07:12.682 --> 07:15.971
warned against possible attacks
in this country?

07:16.061 --> 07:20.977
And I ask you whether you recall
the title of that PDB.

07:22.984 --> 07:24.350
I believe the title was,

07:24.444 --> 07:27.562
"Bin Laden Determined to Attack
Inside the United States."

07:27.906 --> 07:29.442
(ALL MURMURING)

07:57.060 --> 07:58.517
There's no way that we...

07:59.062 --> 08:00.052
Can I help you?

08:01.231 --> 08:03.848
Sir, you're not supposed to be in here.

08:03.942 --> 08:06.309
The cockpit is off-limits.
Please return to your seat.

08:06.486 --> 08:07.476
My apologies.

08:07.570 --> 08:09.857
I thought this was
the door to the lavatory.

08:10.281 --> 08:11.897
Please forgive the intrusion.

08:30.552 --> 08:31.918
Here are your drinks, gentlemen.

08:32.345 --> 08:33.756
Put this on your tab, Mr. O'Neill?

08:33.847 --> 08:35.429
Sure, thank you, Brenna.

08:35.515 --> 08:36.505
Thank you.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.216
(JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING)

08:42.355 --> 08:44.847
Here's to being downgraded,

08:45.859 --> 08:48.943
like an aging center fielder
who's lost his legs.

08:59.873 --> 09:03.412
It would appear the new regime
no longer requires my services.

09:05.628 --> 09:07.369
I've lost my cabinet-level status.

09:07.922 --> 09:10.209
I report to the Deputies Committee now.

09:11.342 --> 09:12.753
But they need you, Dick.

09:13.094 --> 09:14.301
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

09:14.387 --> 09:16.970
If there's one person they need
in the White House right now, it's you.

09:18.099 --> 09:20.466
It's got nothing to do with your legs,
by the way.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.428
It's your mind,
which they're probably afraid of.

09:23.646 --> 09:25.683
Fucking bozos aren't interested in

09:25.940 --> 09:29.854
subtlety or actually learning anything
about how al-Qaeda thinks.

09:29.944 --> 09:32.186
I feel like I'm screaming
from the rooftops

09:32.280 --> 09:33.612
and nobody's listening.

09:37.035 --> 09:38.492
Who's replacing you?

09:38.870 --> 09:40.657
I was actually going to suggest you.

09:44.542 --> 09:45.908
I'm serious, John.

09:48.797 --> 09:51.210
I have to admit
I'm flattered, Dick, but...

09:52.425 --> 09:55.168
I'm the last person
the White House wants to see.

09:55.845 --> 09:58.679
Those bastards don't want me
anywhere near a cabinet meeting.

09:58.765 --> 10:00.472
But when you talk, people listen.

10:00.600 --> 10:01.932
You mean when I shout.

10:02.018 --> 10:04.852
This position needs a bull.

10:08.191 --> 10:09.853
You could make a real difference.

10:11.778 --> 10:13.690
I have a few offers I'm considering.

10:13.863 --> 10:18.153
Mmm. So quickly he pivots
to the private sector.

10:18.910 --> 10:22.620
Well, government salary is not exactly
a huge incentive.

10:22.705 --> 10:24.867
- (CHUCKLES)
- I do have a wardrobe to keep up.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.492
Who's courting you?

10:30.547 --> 10:33.460
Larry Silverstein down at the
World Trade Center, for one.

10:33.716 --> 10:36.709
A few consulting gigs
are offering top dollar.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.927
Financial firms, that type of thing.

10:39.097 --> 10:41.555
I really wish you'd consider
coming to Washington.

10:42.392 --> 10:45.135
- I'd happily make a few calls.
- Richard.

10:45.812 --> 10:48.054
My finances are in shambles.

10:49.566 --> 10:52.434
Plus, burned too many bridges.

10:54.112 --> 10:56.399
I don't have any friends left in D.C.

10:56.489 --> 10:57.946
You might be the only person
who actually thinks

10:58.032 --> 10:59.022
I'm worth a damn.

11:02.245 --> 11:04.157
What about one Martin Schmidt?

11:04.247 --> 11:06.034
I hear he's also out of a job.

11:08.042 --> 11:09.578
Supposed to be some kind of test?

11:10.587 --> 11:13.421
He knows bin Laden, al-Qaeda.
He practically speaks Arabic.

11:14.174 --> 11:16.461
- The guy's passionate.
- You know damn well

11:16.551 --> 11:19.089
you don't want Martin Schmidt
anywhere near the White House.

11:21.723 --> 11:24.181
I think your eyes just turned
the color of hemlock.

11:24.434 --> 11:26.346
(LAUGHS)

11:34.986 --> 11:37.524
- What's up?
- This just in from HQ.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.233
It appears that one

11:39.324 --> 11:41.941
Zacarias Moussaoui,
he is an al-Qaeda Frenchman,

11:42.368 --> 11:44.655
he was apprehended in Eagan, Minnesota,

11:44.913 --> 11:46.905
after it was reported
by his flight-school advisor

11:46.998 --> 11:49.240
that he wasn't interested
in the landing part

11:49.334 --> 11:50.495
of the flying process.

11:51.461 --> 11:54.374
Uh, says local police found
a laptop computer,

11:54.464 --> 11:56.626
two knives, Boeing 747 flight manuals,

11:56.716 --> 11:59.129
flight simulator, fighting gloves,
and shin guards,

11:59.219 --> 12:01.302
and a computer disk
with information about crop dusting.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.762
What's with the shin guards?

12:04.807 --> 12:06.093
Floor hockey enthusiast?

12:07.936 --> 12:10.679
- I don't know what to make of this.
- Yeah, you and me both.

12:12.482 --> 12:15.646
Let's generate a list of all Arabs
enrolled in domestic flight schools.

a remote connection to terrorism.

radicals from every mosque.

Copy that.

a few more options.

in US flight schools.

13:34.856 --> 13:36.643

That's a lot of Arabs
in our flight schools.

Minnesota was just busted

but he wasn't interested
in landing the plane.

13:47.493 --> 13:50.201
And what does I-49 want us
to do with this list?

13:50.455 --> 13:52.822
They'd like us to run it
against our al-Qaeda database.

and anyone remotely connected.

- How many years did he put in?
- Twenty-five.
