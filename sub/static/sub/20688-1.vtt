00:43.126 --> 00:45.918
No. Lennon's lemon liniment.

00:46.043 --> 00:48.459
- A touch more powder, Mr Thorncroft.
- Okay.

00:52.543 --> 00:53.834
There he is.

00:56.876 --> 00:59.209
- Okay, Clive, let's do this.
- Hey, Richie.

00:59.334 --> 01:01.834
I'm just prepping
for the stunt later on, okay?

01:01.918 --> 01:04.334
So, Pat, she's gonna faint.

01:04.459 --> 01:06.793
Okay? And then you pull her up like this.

01:06.918 --> 01:09.043
- Keep this very strong.
- Yeah.

01:09.209 --> 01:11.418
Pelvis close and go for the kiss. Watch this.

01:11.543 --> 01:13.501
Clive, okay, I have read the script.

01:13.626 --> 01:15.209
Something like this?

01:16.126 --> 01:19.251
- I've got you.
- You've got me all right.

01:23.876 --> 01:25.668
Save it for the take, baby.

01:25.751 --> 01:28.501
- Plenty more where that came from.
- That was okay.

01:28.668 --> 01:30.584
But don't open your mouth when you kiss,

01:30.709 --> 01:32.959
because it spreads germs all around the set.

01:33.084 --> 01:37.043
- When you're acting, purse your lips...
- Clive, Clive!

01:37.209 --> 01:38.751
We weren't acting.

01:38.876 --> 01:40.876
- I was acting.
- What?

01:41.543 --> 01:44.709
Ooh, hoo, hoo! Hello!

01:44.834 --> 01:45.793
Pow!

01:45.918 --> 01:48.959
This little firecracker is
the real star of Mindhorn.

01:49.084 --> 01:52.251
- Maybe I could get more lines next time.
- That's a good one!

01:52.376 --> 01:55.751
- That's your handbrake there.
- Okay, walk away, Clive.

01:55.876 --> 01:57.668
Ready to shoot.

01:57.793 --> 01:59.501
Shoes, Clive!

01:59.626 --> 02:02.501
Shoes coming in. Shoes are safe.

02:05.959 --> 02:07.709
Shoes going on.

02:08.709 --> 02:10.043
Shoes on.

02:11.709 --> 02:13.376
Okay, let's go.

02:14.668 --> 02:17.001
Okay, guys, first positions.

02:17.126 --> 02:19.376
- You know I love you.
- Turn over.

02:19.501 --> 02:22.251
- I love you too, honey.
- Sound running.

02:22.376 --> 02:23.793
- Truth time.
- Action!

02:24.918 --> 02:28.501
'In 1983, Special Agent
Bruce P Mindhorn was captured

02:28.626 --> 02:30.918
'during a secret operation
on the Siberian border.

02:31.584 --> 02:35.001
'Communist doctors performed
experimental cybernetic surgery upon him.

02:35.126 --> 02:40.209
'They removed his eye and replaced it
with a super-advanced optical lie detector

02:40.334 --> 02:44.293
'which meant he could
literally see the truth.

02:44.876 --> 02:48.334
'He escaped Russia
and returned home to the Isle of Man.

02:50.293 --> 02:52.959
'Bruce Mindhorn became
the best plain-clothes detective

02:53.084 --> 02:55.709
'the Isle of Man had ever seen.

02:56.376 --> 02:59.918
'In a world of lies, one man has had enough.

03:01.334 --> 03:04.793
'You can't hide the truth from Mindhorn.'

03:09.293 --> 03:12.876
'Richard Thorncroft is an actor
on the crest of a wave.'

03:13.001 --> 03:16.876
'Richard, he's strong
and sprints like a panther.'

03:18.793 --> 03:22.584
'Acting is 95% physicality.

03:23.626 --> 03:25.459
'That's why I practise Capoeira.'

03:26.751 --> 03:29.751
'Here we see Richard demonstrating the Ginga

03:29.834 --> 03:32.043
'that gives him flexibility as an actor.'

03:32.209 --> 03:36.459
Your mouth's saying no,
but your brain's saying yes.

03:36.584 --> 03:40.293
'In real life, Richard's eye
has fallen on part-time actress

03:40.376 --> 03:43.043
'and full-time lovely, Patricia Deville.'

03:43.209 --> 03:45.626
'Richard and I are a wonderful team,

03:45.709 --> 03:50.043
'both at work and hopefully in life forever.'

03:50.251 --> 03:52.084
'Such is the success of Mindhorn,

03:52.251 --> 03:54.709
'it's rumoured that Windjammer
played by Peter Easterman

03:54.834 --> 03:57.001
'may even get his own show.'

03:58.793 --> 04:03.876
'Er, no, I can't envisage
any kind of spin-off.'

04:04.001 --> 04:07.501
'Spin-offs or not,
Richard's star is burning bright

04:07.626 --> 04:10.334
'thanks to publicity genius
Jeffrey Moncrief.'

04:10.459 --> 04:13.793
'We work hard on Mindhorn,
but we play hard too.

04:13.918 --> 04:16.793
'Sometimes too hard. Hello, rehab!'

04:17.793 --> 04:21.709
'To stay at the top, you need to be
remarkable on screen and off,

04:21.834 --> 04:24.626
'and Richard certainly knows
how to play that game.'

04:25.126 --> 04:27.501
The Isle of Man is a... hole.

04:27.626 --> 04:28.834
What?

04:30.084 --> 04:32.293
Peter Easterman is not a great actor.

04:33.043 --> 04:37.751
But when he is acting, at least
he stands there and does stuff.

04:37.876 --> 04:40.418
'Whether Richard's winning awards for acting

04:40.543 --> 04:43.418
'or courting controversy
on top-rated chat shows

04:43.543 --> 04:47.418
'it seems nothing can stop him
heading all the way to the top.'

04:47.584 --> 04:49.626
'I'm going to Hollywood. Bye.'

05:02.501 --> 05:04.418
'Police in the Isle of Man
say they have discovered

05:04.543 --> 05:07.751
'the body of a young woman
washed up on Douglas Beach.'

05:07.876 --> 05:10.876
'Police are treating
Katya Lipinskii's death as murder.'

05:13.043 --> 05:16.709
'Police confirm they have received
phone calls from the suspect,

05:16.793 --> 05:19.626
'but have refused to divulge the content.'

05:40.709 --> 05:42.834
It's Plasticine.

05:43.959 --> 05:45.293
It's here.

05:51.334 --> 05:53.626
- Hello.
- 'I've told you before.

05:53.709 --> 05:57.834
'There's only one person I will speak to:
Detective Mindhorn.'

05:57.959 --> 06:00.043
- Melly?
- 'My name is the Kestrel.'

06:00.209 --> 06:02.334
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

06:03.251 --> 06:05.418
- The Kestrel.
- 'Thank you.

06:05.543 --> 06:08.043
'I'll call the police station
tomorrow at 4:00pm.

06:08.209 --> 06:10.918
'If I'm not talking
to Detective Mindhorn in person,

06:11.043 --> 06:13.001
'more people are going to die.

06:13.126 --> 06:15.418
'Signing off.'

06:20.084 --> 06:23.043
- Chief?
- Oh, great.

06:23.209 --> 06:26.584
Our chief suspect wants to talk
to a fictional fucking detective.

06:29.251 --> 06:32.043
Mindhorn! It was fucking shite an' all.

06:33.918 --> 06:35.584
'Heard of haemotracteathosis?'

06:35.709 --> 06:39.126
'I think it was on the menu
at my local Indian restaurant last night.'

06:40.418 --> 06:42.918
'Bruce, let me help you with this case.'

06:43.043 --> 06:44.959
'I told you before, I work alone.'

06:45.084 --> 06:47.126
What are we going to do, Chief?

06:47.334 --> 06:50.251
We got 24 hours to produce
a convincing Detective Mindhorn.

06:50.376 --> 06:54.418
We're going to have to bring
the actor over to take the call.

06:54.543 --> 06:57.293
- Let's think about this.
- Green's right.

06:57.418 --> 07:00.251
Believe me, I wish that he wasn't.

07:00.334 --> 07:02.584
Get me Mindhorn.

07:04.668 --> 07:06.668
'It's truth time.'

07:13.876 --> 07:17.959
Baboons. Baboons bring bliss.

07:18.084 --> 07:20.959
The Benedict Cumberbatch backlash has begun.

07:25.959 --> 07:29.584
You are exactly where you need to be.

07:34.251 --> 07:37.376
You are a powerful tiger.

07:38.251 --> 07:41.918
Let's do this!

07:42.001 --> 07:44.918
- Bugger, bugger.
- Oi, keep it down, will you?

07:45.043 --> 07:47.501
- Sorry.
- What are you doing in there?

07:52.334 --> 07:54.668
# You can't handcuff the wind

07:57.543 --> 08:00.293
Ah, hello, lovely. Here for the casting.
Richard Thorncroft.

08:00.418 --> 08:03.668
Oh, great. Mr Branagh's
nearly ready for you, Richard...

08:03.751 --> 08:05.876
- Crowthorne?
- Thorncroft.

08:06.001 --> 08:08.709
The B-Man! Kenny B!

08:10.043 --> 08:12.293
Bloody good to see you!

08:12.918 --> 08:14.834
Let's crack this baby open.

08:17.668 --> 08:20.501
Hi. Richard Crowthorne, 11 o'clock.

08:21.543 --> 08:22.584
Oh.

08:23.626 --> 08:24.751
Right.

08:24.876 --> 08:27.126
I speak the truth!

08:27.334 --> 08:29.709
I am afeared of no man.

08:29.834 --> 08:32.083
I am afeared of no creature.

08:32.251 --> 08:34.251
I am my own man.

08:34.376 --> 08:37.333
I am Clifton of Port Antonio.

08:37.458 --> 08:39.083
Do you feel me?

08:40.708 --> 08:43.668
Yeah, that's incredible.
That's literally incredible.

08:43.751 --> 08:45.626
Thank you.

08:45.709 --> 08:47.543
You're welcome, really.

08:47.626 --> 08:49.584
I don't know what to say, but thank you.

08:49.668 --> 08:51.084
I want to try something.

08:51.293 --> 08:53.876
I'd like to do it again,
but this time with a brogue.

08:54.001 --> 08:56.626
No, I think we're good. We've got everything.

08:56.709 --> 08:58.959
I've seen everything I could possibly want.

08:59.043 --> 09:01.084
- Are you sure?
- Oh, yeah.

09:01.251 --> 09:05.293
Well, acting aside,
it's been great to catch up.

09:05.376 --> 09:08.709
Kenny B! This guy was
one crazy hombre back in the day.

09:08.793 --> 09:13.126
- Remember that hotel in Maidstone?
- Oh, who can forget that?

09:13.293 --> 09:16.793
We did a tour of the Medway Basin,
and this fella...

09:16.918 --> 09:19.918
Well, they'll have to repaper
that hotel room.

09:20.043 --> 09:22.959
I love what you're doing these days.
Ken, I admire your balls.

09:23.793 --> 09:25.959
Okay. The B-Man!

09:26.084 --> 09:28.418
- All righty.
- The Killer B!

09:29.584 --> 09:31.209
The Bran Flake!

09:32.959 --> 09:35.751
- Who was that?
- Not a fucking clue.

09:36.543 --> 09:38.043
Hey, brother.

09:38.251 --> 09:40.709
You got my details? Lovely.

09:47.584 --> 09:50.793
'Sorry, Sarah. Front desk
say Richard Thorncroft is here.'

09:50.918 --> 09:53.626
Oh, Christ. I'm with Simon.
Tell him to wait outside.

09:54.334 --> 09:56.584
Ah, Richard, darling. How are you?

09:56.709 --> 09:58.293
'It's too late. I couldn't stop him.'

09:58.418 --> 10:01.501
How am I? Let me think.
I haven't had an audition in 18 months.

10:01.584 --> 10:03.793
And you put me up for a schizophrenic yardie.

10:03.918 --> 10:07.459
- Sounds like a good part to me.
- If you're a 60-year-old Jamaican man.

10:07.584 --> 10:10.084
I'm so sorry, Simon.
I didn't realise it was you.

10:10.251 --> 10:12.793
Big fan, big fan.
Caught your Equus in Chichester.

10:12.918 --> 10:15.459
- Powerful piece of work.
- Great, thank you.

10:15.584 --> 10:17.959
And you were fantastic in, um...

10:18.084 --> 10:20.293
Oh, God, my memory's gone these days.

10:20.418 --> 10:22.543
- Anyway, you were fantastic.
- Thank you.

10:22.668 --> 10:24.709
Sorry about the cock-up. New assistant.

10:24.834 --> 10:27.293
How can you mix me up with Crowthorne?
Do I not exist anymore?

10:27.418 --> 10:30.459
- No one seems to know who I am.
- Me and the Branster go way back.

10:30.584 --> 10:32.668
- I don't suppose you could...
- Simon sweetie...

10:32.751 --> 10:34.626
Could you just give us a few moments?

10:34.709 --> 10:37.251
- I could have this salad.
- Come back, two minutes.

10:40.126 --> 10:43.418
- What the hell's going on?
- You're going through a transitional phase.

10:43.543 --> 10:45.084
You said that five years ago, Sarah.

10:45.251 --> 10:47.918
I mean, you're moving
from young, handsome hero

10:48.043 --> 10:50.668
to older, still very handsome...

10:50.751 --> 10:54.376
What about my autobiography?
Are there any takers, any bites?

10:54.501 --> 10:57.084
'It's a quiet time
for actors' autobiographies.'

10:57.251 --> 10:59.418
It's not very quiet for Peter Easterman.

10:59.543 --> 11:01.376
No, I don't think so. Volume three?

11:01.543 --> 11:04.418
What's this one called?
"What I Did Yesterday"? Ha!

11:04.543 --> 11:06.459
Windjammer's on its 16th season.

11:06.584 --> 11:08.293
'He's built a franchise.

11:08.418 --> 11:11.251
'He's even got his own range
of weatherproof clothing.'

11:11.334 --> 11:13.751
I did not get into this business
to sell kagoules.

11:13.876 --> 11:17.126
- Well, you've got to sell something.
- Sell this, hmm?

11:17.293 --> 11:20.584
This is a map of human emotion. Sell it!

11:20.709 --> 11:22.709
Nobody can. You haven't got profile.

11:22.793 --> 11:25.293
That's why you made me
do the Thrombi-Sox ads.

11:25.459 --> 11:28.084
To give me profile.
Thank God for Thrombi-Sox.

11:28.251 --> 11:30.584
And that is not a sentence
I thought I'd ever utter.

11:30.709 --> 11:32.418
About Thrombi-Sox...

11:32.918 --> 11:35.376
- What?
- They've gone in a different direction.

11:35.501 --> 11:37.376
'John fucking Nettle?'

11:37.459 --> 11:39.709
'You told the director he was an embryo.'

11:39.834 --> 11:41.626
'Well, he's about 12.'

11:41.709 --> 11:44.418
Sit down and calm down. Come on.

11:44.543 --> 11:47.671
All is not lost.
I had a very interesting offer for you.

11:47.751 --> 11:50.251
- An offer?
- From the police.

11:50.834 --> 11:53.418
- What do you mean?
- They want you to talk to a suspect...

11:53.584 --> 11:56.001
See if you can lure him into custody.

11:56.084 --> 11:58.668
What, so this is a voiceover or something?

11:58.793 --> 12:00.918
Yeah, a bit like a voiceover.

12:01.043 --> 12:03.668
- 'He thinks Mindhorn is a real detective.'
- 'What?'

12:03.751 --> 12:05.001
Mindhorn! That was it.

12:05.126 --> 12:07.418
You were wonderful. That was your Amadeus.

12:07.543 --> 12:09.543
Well, I mean, Amadeus was my Amadeus.

12:09.668 --> 12:13.626
'Fuck off, Callow! This is a private
conversation with my agent!'

12:13.709 --> 12:15.584
Just calm down and sit down.

12:15.709 --> 12:18.043
- I don't want to sit down.
- Then stand up, but calm down.

12:18.209 --> 12:19.668
I'll sit down.

12:19.751 --> 12:21.084
Sit down, then.

12:21.251 --> 12:23.793
Okay, so let's focus on this Mindhorn thing.

12:23.918 --> 12:26.584
- I was bloody good in Mindhorn.
- You'll be even better now.

12:26.709 --> 12:29.084
You've matured like a fine wine.

12:29.251 --> 12:31.834
- A man could get drunk on that wine.
- Great.

12:31.959 --> 12:34.084
So go to the Isle of Man, take the call...

12:34.293 --> 12:36.709
- Sorry, where?
- The Isle of Man.

12:36.834 --> 12:40.126
This isn't going to work for me.
I do not go backwards in my career.

12:40.293 --> 12:42.709
- I move ever forwards...
- Like a shark.

12:42.793 --> 12:45.793
Yes, but maybe going backwards
is the new going forwards.

12:46.334 --> 12:48.334
Why don't you hook up with the old gang?

12:49.251 --> 12:51.959
Jeffrey Moncrief has got his own PR firm now.

12:52.084 --> 12:54.668
Jeffrey Moncrief?
He went off the rails, I'm afraid.

12:54.751 --> 12:56.543
Looks kosher to me.

12:56.668 --> 12:59.501
You need all the publicity
you can get from this.

12:59.626 --> 13:02.084
What about Pat Deville, your old flame?

13:02.251 --> 13:05.834
Works for Manx TV now. Profile, Richard.

13:05.918 --> 13:09.251
'Imagine: TV cop helps real cop solve crime.

13:09.376 --> 13:11.834
'It's PR gold. You'd be a hero!

13:11.959 --> 13:15.209
'Do the interviews, get in the papers,
remind people who you are,

13:15.293 --> 13:17.084
'and bang, you're back on the map.

13:17.251 --> 13:20.043
'Just play Mindhorn one last time.'

13:27.043 --> 13:28.459
Profile!

13:56.834 --> 13:58.793
'Isle of Man Constabulary.'

13:58.918 --> 14:01.334
- I'm in.
- 'Sorry, who is this?'

14:06.668 --> 14:10.501
'Hello. Moncrief Public Relations
International Limited.'

14:10.626 --> 14:13.834
- Jeff!
- 'Richie! Are you here?'

14:13.959 --> 14:16.501
Yep, I'm here.
Two o'clock ferry, like we said.

14:16.626 --> 14:19.834
- Where are you?
- 'I'm working my butt off here for you.

14:19.959 --> 14:23.834
'Why don't I see you at the police station
once I finish up here at the office?'

14:23.959 --> 14:26.293
Okay, sounds good. What about the newspapers?

14:26.418 --> 14:28.376
The Manx Express loves it.

14:28.501 --> 14:33.209
They're sending a photographer
to get some shots of you doing the call.

14:33.334 --> 14:37.418
Now, we've got to get to Pat
at Manx TV before she knocks off.

14:37.543 --> 14:41.209
You know what? I think I might have time
to squeeze that in before the gig.

14:41.376 --> 14:43.709
I bet you have, you devil!

14:43.793 --> 14:45.876
'Hey, come on!

14:46.001 --> 14:50.043
She's not married
and you're the thinking woman's crumpet!

14:50.126 --> 14:51.918
Bye, Jeff.

14:52.043 --> 14:53.418
Ahoy, there!

14:54.709 --> 14:58.709
This is the old stomping ground,
back in the old wild-oats-sowing days.

14:58.793 --> 15:01.084
Yeah, there's very good soil here.

15:01.251 --> 15:03.626
'Welcome to the Isle of Man,

15:03.709 --> 15:07.584
'isle of adventure, isle of romance...
I'll have some of that!'

15:07.709 --> 15:11.918
- Mr Thorncroft, DS Baines.
- Enchanté. Call me Richard.

15:12.001 --> 15:14.709
PC Green and I will be
overseeing your stay here.

15:14.793 --> 15:16.876
- Roger that.
- We really appreciate this.

15:17.001 --> 15:19.543
- I know you're a busy man.
- I had to move things around.

15:19.668 --> 15:22.376
But work is work. This is more important.

15:22.501 --> 15:23.959
Let's save some lives.

15:25.084 --> 15:26.709
- This us?
- Yeah, yeah.

15:34.959 --> 15:36.209
Thanks.

15:38.209 --> 15:39.793
- You in?
- Yeah, yeah, great.

15:42.001 --> 15:44.251
Melly thought Mindhorn was real.

15:44.334 --> 15:48.209
Yeah, well, three years at RADA
give a man some skills.

15:48.334 --> 15:50.501
- Were you a fan of the show?
- My mum liked it.

15:50.584 --> 15:53.126
Ah, a woman of taste.

15:53.293 --> 15:55.834
- Is she single?
- She's dead.

15:55.959 --> 15:58.959
We'll give you a knock in 20 minutes.

15:59.084 --> 16:02.043
- Lovely.
- Stay in the room for your safety.

16:02.209 --> 16:04.126
Sure thing, big guy.

16:17.209 --> 16:19.834
- You gonna be there the whole time?
- That's right.

16:19.959 --> 16:22.709
Good, really good news.

16:22.793 --> 16:26.709
I'm gonna be doing some meditating, so...

16:26.834 --> 16:28.376
- Do you meditate?
- No.

16:28.501 --> 16:30.376
- Something to think about.
- Thanks.

16:30.501 --> 16:32.543
Sorry about your mum.

16:33.668 --> 16:34.876
Shit!

16:52.626 --> 16:54.126
I'm just meeting someone here.

16:54.293 --> 16:57.293
- She let you do that to her?
- Not for the first time.

16:57.418 --> 17:00.834
Anyway, download that footage
and get that sent over.

17:00.959 --> 17:04.709
Yeah, it's an offer or nothing.
Just the way I play it, Jeremy.

17:04.834 --> 17:07.209
Bloody hell! I'll call you back.

17:07.751 --> 17:09.417
Patricia Deville.

17:10.459 --> 17:11.501
Don't tell me.

17:12.834 --> 17:14.709
- Sorry, it's gone.
- You're joking?

17:14.834 --> 17:17.459
We did live together
for over two and a half years.

17:18.334 --> 17:19.876
We certainly did.

17:20.001 --> 17:21.584
What are you doing here?

17:21.709 --> 17:24.834
Oh, you know, work, meetings.
Busy, busy. You know how it is.

17:24.959 --> 17:28.668
- What are you doing here?
- I'm a journalist now. I work here.

17:28.751 --> 17:30.251
Get out of town!

17:31.543 --> 17:35.251
That's amazing. Actually,
I might just have something for you.

17:35.376 --> 17:36.793
Is it weed killer?

17:37.418 --> 17:39.793
- Hmm?
- You left our house to get weed killer...

17:39.876 --> 17:43.084
...24 years ago. I haven't seen you since.

17:43.251 --> 17:46.834
- I see what you're doing.
- The weeds are really out of control now.

17:46.959 --> 17:49.876
- I explained my departure in the letters.
- The letters?

17:50.001 --> 17:52.418
Yeah, the letters that
you failed to respond to.

17:55.251 --> 17:57.668
- Let's not do this.
- Let's not even go there.

17:57.751 --> 18:01.126
I'm only here for a couple of days
and I'm about to launch something big.

18:01.334 --> 18:04.626
- I was thinking...
- You want to use me for publicity, right?

18:04.709 --> 18:06.501
You need some profile. Is that it?

18:06.626 --> 18:09.459
Way off, Pat.
I can't talk about the details right now.

18:09.626 --> 18:12.918
Let's just say,
it's an interesting little acting job.

18:13.043 --> 18:15.459
Right. I thought maybe you'd given up acting.

18:15.584 --> 18:17.793
Obviously didn't catch me
in Midsummer Murders.

18:17.959 --> 18:20.376
That's what made me think you'd given up.

18:21.501 --> 18:23.543
Pow! Ooh, you got me.

18:23.626 --> 18:26.084
Look at this.
Laughin' and a-jokin' like old times.

18:26.293 --> 18:27.834
Got to run.

18:27.959 --> 18:31.918
You'd be foolish to walk away from what
I'm about to plonk down on the table.

18:32.001 --> 18:33.959
I'm a serious journalist now.

18:34.043 --> 18:36.709
Maybe catching
the psychotic killer, Paul Melly,

18:36.793 --> 18:38.959
isn't a serious enough story for you.

18:44.584 --> 18:47.709
There's a press gag on that case.
How do you know about it?

18:47.793 --> 18:52.459
Why don't we grab a bite
and I'll give you the full exposé?

18:52.584 --> 18:56.084
- You mean exclusive.
- Whatever you say.

18:57.126 --> 18:59.751
- Let's talk later.
- Let's do that.

19:07.251 --> 19:09.459
Still got it. Ha-ha!

19:09.543 --> 19:10.709
Shit!

19:16.459 --> 19:19.251
- Where is he?
- He said he was meditating.

19:20.918 --> 19:23.418
Went pretty deep, threw in a bit of Capoeira.

19:24.543 --> 19:25.876
Right.

19:26.001 --> 19:27.418
Let's nail this mother!

19:27.543 --> 19:28.751
Sorry.

19:30.001 --> 19:32.001
The suspect's name is Paul Melly,

19:32.126 --> 19:35.751
and he might be using the island's
extensive mine system to evade capture.

19:35.876 --> 19:37.709
Mine system? Clever bugger.

19:37.834 --> 19:39.918
Do you recognise him, Richard?

19:40.751 --> 19:43.709
Oh, my God. It's my agent.

19:43.793 --> 19:45.668
Only joking!

19:45.751 --> 19:48.584
Could I get an Americano with hot milk?

19:48.709 --> 19:51.876
Tragically, the boy's parents were killed
in a car crash when he was nine.

19:52.001 --> 19:54.834
And when he was informed,
he was watching Mindhorn,

19:54.959 --> 19:58.209
so he has developed a sort
of morbid obsession with the show.

19:58.334 --> 20:00.501
Could've been worse,
could've been Windjammer.

20:00.626 --> 20:03.293
Yeah, well, he is calling
in 15 minutes, Richard,

20:03.418 --> 20:06.626
and... he's calling himself the Kestrel.

20:06.709 --> 20:10.126
Now, he might make
some sort of kestrel noises.

20:10.293 --> 20:11.543
Kestrel noises, good.

20:11.668 --> 20:14.668
Look, I've got friends coming.
Can I put a list on reception?

20:14.751 --> 20:17.751
- A list at reception?
- Yeah, Jeffrey Moncrief plus one.

20:17.876 --> 20:19.918
This is Chief Inspector Newson.

20:20.043 --> 20:23.709
Ah, the head honcho.
El honcherino. The Big Cheese.

20:23.834 --> 20:26.501
- You look familiar. Did we golf?
- No.

20:26.584 --> 20:29.418
I wanted to talk to you
about the press conference.

20:29.543 --> 20:31.629
We could co-host, but I'm camera trained.

20:31.709 --> 20:34.876
Sometimes, police can come across
as weird and sweaty-looking.

20:35.001 --> 20:38.834
Mr Thorncroft, you are aware
of the seriousness of the situation?

20:38.959 --> 20:41.959
Big time. Yes, indeed.
We'll hash out the details later.

20:42.084 --> 20:45.668
- Is there a dressing room?
- You know how phones work, right?

20:45.751 --> 20:48.459
- Do you know how acting works?
- I'm not interested.

20:48.584 --> 20:50.251
We all have our process.

20:50.376 --> 20:53.668
Sometimes an item of clothing
or footwear can define a character.

20:53.751 --> 20:55.751
You have your costume, I have mine.

20:55.876 --> 20:57.671
This isn't a costume.

20:57.751 --> 21:01.376
This is an officially sanctioned uniform
denoting rank and civic responsibility.

21:01.543 --> 21:04.751
It's still a kind of costume.
You put it on to play the Chief.

21:04.876 --> 21:08.209
Then later on, you take it off
when you go home to your wife.

21:08.293 --> 21:09.709
Or maybe you don't.

21:09.876 --> 21:11.918
- All the world's a stage.
- No, it isn't.

21:12.043 --> 21:13.876
A young woman has been murdered.

21:14.043 --> 21:17.459
We're trying to catch her killer
before he does it again.

21:17.584 --> 21:19.709
- Okay.
- Do you want to get changed in here?

21:20.834 --> 21:23.668
What's wrong with him? Lost his truncheon?

21:25.376 --> 21:29.043
Jeff, the cops are being a bit
bloody stingy with their door policy.

21:29.209 --> 21:30.376
Ah, bastards!

21:30.501 --> 21:34.709
We'll have to get the photographer
to take the photos outside, looking in.

21:34.834 --> 21:37.376
I'm on the first floor.
I'll favour the north side.

21:37.501 --> 21:39.084
'North windows. Got it.'

21:39.251 --> 21:42.084
- 'Are you nearly here?'
- I'm running a tad late, Richie.

21:42.251 --> 21:44.959
I had to tidy up the Glendale account.

21:45.084 --> 21:47.334
Will you speed things up there, Barbara?

21:47.459 --> 21:50.751
'It's great to be heading back
to the big time with you, Richie.'

21:50.876 --> 21:54.501
- 'Wish me luck.'
- You are going to be great, Richie.

21:54.668 --> 21:56.084
Tits and teeth, eh?

21:59.501 --> 22:01.876
Hello, old friend.

22:30.084 --> 22:31.668
- Richard.
- Bainesy.

22:31.751 --> 22:34.709
When Melly calls,
stay in character at all times.

22:34.793 --> 22:36.876
Don't worry. When I go in, I go deep.

22:37.001 --> 22:39.709
Ah, the old two-way mirrors.
I love these things.

22:41.043 --> 22:44.001
Okay, here's a list of prompts.
Just stick to script.

22:44.084 --> 22:46.418
And avoid any of these trigger words.

22:46.543 --> 22:50.293
"Insane, nutjob, mental."
Blah, blah, blah, usual stuff.

22:50.418 --> 22:52.293
- This the phone?
- That is the phone.

22:52.376 --> 22:53.584
- Great.
- Yeah.

22:57.834 --> 22:59.043
Yeah.

23:00.501 --> 23:02.626
It's going to be okay.

23:11.584 --> 23:13.751
If you could just keep it in the cradle.

23:13.876 --> 23:15.709
Just connecting with the props.

23:15.834 --> 23:19.876
So, when he calls,
keep him on the line, keep him talking,

23:20.501 --> 23:22.709
arrange to meet and we'll take it from there.

23:23.751 --> 23:26.629
Here you go, Richard.
I couldn't find any Manuka honey.

23:26.709 --> 23:29.126
- Oh. Two teabags, though?
- Yeah, like you said.

23:29.293 --> 23:31.709
Good. A little tip I picked up
from Sean Bean.

23:31.793 --> 23:33.876
Double-bag Bean, we called him. The Bean Bag!

23:38.501 --> 23:40.126
This is it.

23:40.293 --> 23:42.293
Shoes going on.

23:44.834 --> 23:46.668
Shoes on.

23:48.334 --> 23:50.959
Yeah, whenever you're ready, Richard.

24:01.293 --> 24:04.001
Yep, whenever you're ready, Richard.

24:06.126 --> 24:07.709
Oh, Jesus! Answer it.

24:07.793 --> 24:11.251
- Fucking clown!
- Mindhorn makes people wait.

24:11.376 --> 24:14.626
And when they wait, they become angry
and they become vulnerable,

24:14.709 --> 24:18.043
and when they're vulnerable,
they make mistakes.

24:18.209 --> 24:20.918
Yo, what's going down?

24:21.043 --> 24:22.709
Hello? Hello?

24:22.793 --> 24:24.709
He's hung up.

24:24.834 --> 24:27.126
You might want to try 1471.

24:29.001 --> 24:30.751
Yo, what's going down, Kestrel?

24:30.918 --> 24:34.293
- 'Do you remember me?'
- Course I do. What do you want, sir?

24:34.418 --> 24:38.293
- 'I have something for you, Mindhorn.'
- That's nice. Is it my birthday?

24:38.418 --> 24:40.376
He's close, maybe in a phone box.

24:40.501 --> 24:43.501
The only present I'm interested in
is the truth.

24:43.626 --> 24:47.834
And don't bother wrapping it,
because I don't care for pretty packaging.

24:47.959 --> 24:50.376
'How do I know this is really you?'

24:50.501 --> 24:54.793
How do I know it's really you, Kestrel,
and not some insane, mental nutjob?

24:55.709 --> 24:58.876
'Why would you say that? I'm the Kestrel!'

25:01.751 --> 25:05.751
- 'More people are going to die.'
- We're all going to die. Get over it.

25:05.876 --> 25:08.209
Some with a bang, some with a whimper,

25:08.376 --> 25:10.459
some with a weird wasting disease.

25:12.751 --> 25:15.459
- 'Oh, it really is you.'
- Gold star, Kestrel.

25:15.584 --> 25:18.376
Now tell me something
I don't already bloody know.

25:18.501 --> 25:23.209
'You want to catch Katya's killer,
don't you? Well, get this...

25:24.543 --> 25:26.709
'What's that noise?
Is there anyone else there?

25:26.834 --> 25:28.876
Negative, sir. Mindhorn works alone.

25:29.001 --> 25:32.668
Listen, big guy, why don't we grab
some face-to-face time?

25:32.751 --> 25:35.209
- Where are you calling from?
- 'No, it's not safe.

25:35.334 --> 25:37.709
'The piggies are listening.
You know the quarry?'

25:37.793 --> 25:40.584
- Of course I know.
- 'Good. I'll meet you outside it.'

25:40.709 --> 25:42.334
- See you there.
- 'Come alone.'

25:42.459 --> 25:44.459
- I always do.
- Which quarry?

25:44.584 --> 25:46.293
- No idea. Did you get a trace?
- No.

25:46.376 --> 25:49.209
What kind of an outfit is this?
That is a rookie mistake.

25:49.834 --> 25:50.918
Hey.

25:51.084 --> 25:55.959
- You were meant to keep him on the line.
- That's not the way the scene played out.

25:56.084 --> 25:59.834
- There's a quarry at Vazon Edge.
- That's where we did all our car chases.

25:59.918 --> 26:02.584
That's where he'll be. Go get him, team.

26:03.459 --> 26:06.043
- Prick!
- Oh, dear.

26:06.126 --> 26:07.918
Someone's not a happy bunny.

26:08.043 --> 26:10.834
I remember now, it was his wife
I used to play golf with,

26:10.959 --> 26:12.751
if you catch my drift.

26:14.251 --> 26:16.834
Hole in one. Didn't think he knew.

26:16.959 --> 26:20.334
Er... Why did Melly say outside the quarry?

26:21.709 --> 26:25.293
Do you think "the quarry" meant
something different on Mindhorn?

26:25.459 --> 26:28.376
A quarry's a quarry.
I wouldn't overthink these things.

26:28.501 --> 26:30.501
Just going to go and drain the python.

26:31.084 --> 26:33.959
Then we can have a natter
about the press conference.

26:35.876 --> 26:38.709
'ETA to Vazon Edge quarry: four minutes.'

26:47.043 --> 26:50.626
All cars, the quarry is the police station.
Melly is here. Over.

26:50.709 --> 26:53.418
'Roger that. Diverting.'

26:53.584 --> 26:56.459
Turn around. Do it now!

26:56.584 --> 27:00.251
- What are you doing?
- Move the fucking van, you prick!

27:01.084 --> 27:02.334
Richard!

27:13.918 --> 27:18.293
Thorncroft's gone. I repeat,
I have lost eyes on Thorncroft.

27:18.418 --> 27:19.376
Shit.

27:19.501 --> 27:21.918
Okay, you got the action shot
through the window.

27:22.043 --> 27:24.584
- Why don't we hit the park?
- Good plan.

27:24.709 --> 27:28.793
'Thorncroft may be in danger.
The suspect was outside the station.'

27:29.459 --> 27:31.793
That'd be a great backdrop. I'll be here.

27:31.918 --> 27:33.876
Obviously I'll pull this in on the day.

27:34.001 --> 27:37.126
- Good to go.
- Your face has fallen down.

27:37.334 --> 27:40.251
- It's all baggy.
- Yeah. Do you mind? We all age.

27:40.376 --> 27:44.834
Use back light, soften the focus.
I'm not going to tell you your job. Jesus!

27:44.959 --> 27:46.876
- Jeff?
- 'Richie, where are you?'

27:47.001 --> 27:49.959
I'm with the photographer.
He's a bit weird. Where are you?

27:50.084 --> 27:52.668
'I'm with the photographer
outside the station.'

27:52.751 --> 27:54.709
You must have made quite an impression.

27:54.834 --> 27:57.709
There's police running about
like headless chickens.

28:00.376 --> 28:03.459
'Are you celebrating already? Richie?'

28:04.418 --> 28:06.834
Clever Mindhorn.

28:06.918 --> 28:09.209
It's time.

28:10.501 --> 28:14.418
Time for the apocalypse of justice.

28:19.251 --> 28:21.376
Aargh! Ooh!

28:33.709 --> 28:35.251
Mindhorn.

28:35.376 --> 28:37.126
Please, no.

28:37.293 --> 28:39.584
Look into my eyes.

28:40.834 --> 28:43.543
- Can you see the truth?
- Yeah.

28:43.668 --> 28:46.793
Did you receive the evidence
I sent to your house?

28:46.918 --> 28:48.876
Yes, definitely.

28:49.001 --> 28:51.209
You did? Then you know I'm innocent.

28:51.376 --> 28:53.751
- Are you on the case?
- Yes, sir.

29:02.293 --> 29:06.084
- It's pretend, see?
- Melly, step away from the actor.

29:06.251 --> 29:09.459
- Stay down, Richard.
- See you at the wheel, Mindhorn.

29:09.584 --> 29:11.918
Shoot him! Shoot him in the head!

29:23.668 --> 29:28.751
My next guest is a celebrated actor
and now an award-winning writer.

29:28.876 --> 29:31.501
Richard Thorncroft, welcome to the show.

29:31.626 --> 29:33.043
Hello.

29:33.209 --> 29:36.793
So you've finished your book,
which is not only deeply entertaining,

29:36.918 --> 29:40.876
it is also the first actor's autobiography
to be nominated for a Booker Prize.

29:41.668 --> 29:44.834
You've embarked on a production
of Hamlet with Kenneth Branagh,

29:44.959 --> 29:49.251
and become a hero by making this island
safe for vulnerable women like myself.

29:49.376 --> 29:51.418
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

29:52.126 --> 29:55.043
Apparently, after the shock
of the accident, your hair grew back.

29:55.209 --> 29:58.459
Yes, it's a medical phenomenon
known as follicle neogenesis.

29:58.584 --> 30:01.293
'And conversely,
when I heard about the accident,

30:01.418 --> 30:02.751
'all my hair fell out.'

30:02.876 --> 30:06.001
Thanks, Ken, but we're talking
about Richard at the moment.

30:06.126 --> 30:09.459
- 'Oh, I'm so sorry. Sorry, Rich.'
- No probs, Ken.

30:09.584 --> 30:11.293
'Okay.'

30:11.418 --> 30:14.626
- May I?
- Fill your boots.

30:15.126 --> 30:17.376
- Mm, that's it.
- Oh.

30:17.501 --> 30:18.918
Don't be afraid.

30:19.584 --> 30:24.834
'With that audition, he changed the way
that people think about making art.

30:25.709 --> 30:27.959
'Politically, he's become very important.

30:28.126 --> 30:30.418
'For me, there is no one else.

30:30.543 --> 30:35.043
'It's, like, Mandela, Ben Kingsley,
and then there is Richard.'

30:35.209 --> 30:36.543
Richard...

30:36.668 --> 30:40.293
I'm going to give you the best
Manx Day you've ever had.

30:42.001 --> 30:45.584
'Of course, the parade is
at the heart of Manx Day.

30:45.709 --> 30:48.209
'Always has been, always will be...'

30:57.668 --> 31:00.334
- Richie, baby!
- Jeffrey Moncrief!

31:00.501 --> 31:02.459
Good to see you!

31:03.584 --> 31:06.501
Look at you! The years have treated you well.

31:06.626 --> 31:09.543
- You too.
- Ah, don't lie. I'm a fucking wreck.

31:09.668 --> 31:11.793
- But who cares? You did it.
- That's right.

31:11.959 --> 31:14.001
They got him. You're a hero.

31:14.126 --> 31:16.501
I don't think you can smoke
in hospitals, Jeff.

31:16.584 --> 31:18.626
- Since when?
- Since the '50s.

31:18.709 --> 31:20.793
Oh, right. How did it go with Pat?

31:20.918 --> 31:23.709
Very well, actually.
I think we might just be in there.

31:23.793 --> 31:26.293
- I'll bet you are, eh?
- Strictly business.

31:26.418 --> 31:29.918
Oh, good, because when
your heroics hit the front page,

31:30.043 --> 31:32.084
you'll have minge coming out your arse.

31:32.209 --> 31:33.543
Ah, lovely.

31:33.668 --> 31:35.584
You remember these guys?

31:35.709 --> 31:38.126
"Nutmeg, the druid detective."

31:38.293 --> 31:41.834
"Moonshaft: he's blind,
he's black and he's back."

31:41.959 --> 31:43.543
They're out on DVD?

31:43.626 --> 31:46.043
Ten grand apiece they got,
and they were shite!

31:46.209 --> 31:49.459
Mindhorn had a metal eye
that could see the truth.

31:49.584 --> 31:52.543
What did Nutmeg have?
Some fucking joss sticks!

31:52.668 --> 31:56.459
- This is interesting, Jeff.
- Aye, and Pete thinks so too.

31:56.584 --> 32:00.459
He even wants to release it
through his production company.

32:00.584 --> 32:03.126
- Pete Easterman?
- The Windjammer himself.

32:03.293 --> 32:06.293
This is a bad idea, Jeff.
Pete and I have a history.

32:06.418 --> 32:09.629
- Things have been said.
- That's all water under the bridge.

32:09.709 --> 32:13.043
Pete insisted you come
to his country club this evening.

32:13.209 --> 32:14.793
He wants to make it happen.

32:14.876 --> 32:18.418
Mindhorn, series one to three on DVD.

32:18.584 --> 32:21.459
How do you like those apples?

32:21.584 --> 32:24.001
This is actually a bloody good idea.

32:24.126 --> 32:26.334
I told you, eh? Lovely.

32:26.418 --> 32:28.501
Seven o'clock, Jammer's club.

32:28.626 --> 32:33.709
Lock up your pussy.
The wolf pack is back on the prowl!

32:33.793 --> 32:36.418
It's a hospital, Jeff.
Keep it down a little bit.

32:36.543 --> 32:39.834
Flange ahoy, Richie. Flange ahoy.

32:39.918 --> 32:41.251
Yes, indeed.

32:42.293 --> 32:45.876
'More on that unfolding tragedy later.

32:46.001 --> 32:48.626
'Why does the Manx cat have no tail?

32:49.376 --> 32:53.043
'Some say they swam ashore
during a shipwreck in the 16th century.

32:53.209 --> 32:55.334
'Others say it's a genetic mutation...'

32:59.543 --> 33:01.459
Chekhov!

33:01.584 --> 33:02.918
Chekhov!

33:06.959 --> 33:09.418
- Hello.
- 'Hello, you.'

33:09.543 --> 33:11.084
- Hello, Richard.
- 'Hello.'

33:11.209 --> 33:13.459
So, you're still at the Heights.

33:14.376 --> 33:16.709
Yes, that's a good guess.

33:16.876 --> 33:18.626
So, I hear they caught Melly.

33:18.709 --> 33:22.834
'Yeah, that lunatic won't be troubling
the women of this island no more.

33:22.959 --> 33:25.543
- Quite a story.
- 'I like to think so.'

33:25.668 --> 33:28.418
Richard Thorncroft does something
for somebody else.

33:28.543 --> 33:30.626
'Pow. I walked into that.'

33:30.709 --> 33:34.459
- 'Where are you at the moment?'
- Oh, I'm staying at the Grand.

33:34.626 --> 33:38.501
That's where they've put me up,
anyway, you know, for my sins.

33:38.626 --> 33:43.293
It's nice, you know, a little suite.
One of those little... suites.

33:43.418 --> 33:47.126
Ooh, sorry, just slipped on a breakfast tray.

33:47.293 --> 33:49.584
Ha! Bloody room service.

33:49.668 --> 33:52.084
Yeah, I mean, who'd have thought

33:52.251 --> 33:56.334
you and I would've ended up drifting
like two lonely boats on the sea of life?

33:57.751 --> 34:01.001
Just two boats who crossed once before

34:01.084 --> 34:03.876
and are now crossing again
on the return charter,

34:04.001 --> 34:07.376
looking for that safe harbour,
that magical other person.

34:07.501 --> 34:11.543
That other person can be staring you
in the face and you never even realise it.

34:11.668 --> 34:12.668
Hey, Richie.

34:15.126 --> 34:17.543
- Clive.
- Wow!

34:17.668 --> 34:20.626
- Wow, so good to see you!
- It's so good to see you.

34:20.708 --> 34:22.918
What are you doing in my garden, man?

34:23.001 --> 34:25.418
- What are you doing in the garden?
- I live here.

34:25.543 --> 34:28.126
Yeah... What, in the garden?

34:28.251 --> 34:31.208
No, silly. I live here with Pat.

34:31.333 --> 34:34.126
We've been together
for many years now, since you left.

34:34.293 --> 34:35.751
- You know that, right?
- Yeah.

34:35.876 --> 34:38.043
- You're joking with me.
- That's old news.

34:38.251 --> 34:39.583
- Joke.
- Oh, wow!

34:39.668 --> 34:42.583
So, what are you doing in the garden?

34:42.708 --> 34:43.833
Yeah.

34:44.958 --> 34:46.876
Just coming to get some fan mail.

34:46.958 --> 34:49.751
- I popped round to get it.
- We get that from time to time.

34:49.876 --> 34:52.126
- So I thought...
- What's with the flowers?

34:52.751 --> 34:55.293
I've got a funeral later to do.

34:55.376 --> 34:57.459
- I guess you're at that age.
- Yeah, sad.

34:57.584 --> 34:59.668
- Anyone I know?
- John Nettles.

34:59.751 --> 35:02.293
John Nettles? Shit. I know John really well.

35:02.418 --> 35:05.793
- Not that John Nettles, another one.
- Oh, okay, that's a relief.

35:05.918 --> 35:07.459
Come in. My God, come in!

35:07.584 --> 35:09.626
- Pat's gonna love to see you.
- Yeah...

35:09.709 --> 35:12.626
- Everyone wants to see you.
- That's very nice of you.

35:12.709 --> 35:15.709
- Everyone?
- Keys to the Range Rover, please.

35:15.834 --> 35:17.668
Hey, Jasmine, look who it is.

35:17.793 --> 35:19.001
It's Mindhorn.

35:21.001 --> 35:23.459
I used to be his stuntman.
Can you believe it?

35:23.584 --> 35:25.376
Look at him now. Look at this.

35:25.501 --> 35:28.501
- What is this here?
- It's called living the high life.

35:28.626 --> 35:30.126
Yeah? Too many biscuits.

35:30.334 --> 35:33.376
- Ah, champagne, you know.
- Too many Garibaldis.

35:33.501 --> 35:36.626
- Steak and rich cheese.
- At least he covers himself up.

35:36.709 --> 35:39.209
- Can you put some trousers on?
- She's joking.

35:39.334 --> 35:42.209
She's very funny.
She has her mother's tongue.

35:43.668 --> 35:46.709
- Richard Thorncroft.
- Yeah, look at him. There he is.

35:46.793 --> 35:49.501
- I've heard a lot about you.
- All of it good, I hope.

35:50.251 --> 35:52.376
Oh, watch out!

35:53.376 --> 35:54.668
This guy, okay,

35:54.751 --> 35:58.834
this guy used to make me tell everybody
he did his own stunts.

35:58.959 --> 36:02.001
- Well, I did a few.
- No, no, you naughty liar.

36:02.126 --> 36:04.334
- That's not lying.
- You never did any.

36:04.459 --> 36:06.709
- You naughty, naughty boy.
- I did some.

36:06.793 --> 36:09.418
- He couldn't even drive a car.
- But now I have passed.

36:09.543 --> 36:13.293
I'd love to stay and watch you two
verbally sparring, but I have to go.

36:13.418 --> 36:14.834
Mum, are you ready?

36:15.709 --> 36:18.501
Hey, Pat, look what I found in the garden.

36:18.626 --> 36:20.459
It's a Richard Thorncroft tree.

36:20.584 --> 36:22.918
I cut him down and brought him in the house.

36:24.418 --> 36:27.959
Richard, what are you doing here?
You said you were at the Grand.

36:28.043 --> 36:30.668
Oh, I can answer that.
He's come for some fan mail.

36:30.751 --> 36:33.626
You're getting your fan mail?
Oh, I'm really touched.

36:33.751 --> 36:36.668
There's some in the garage.
I'll go and fetch it for you.

36:37.709 --> 36:39.709
Oh, don't go getting back together.

36:39.834 --> 36:42.918
I'm kidding. Look at him.
He's so fat now. He's a mess.

36:43.043 --> 36:44.668
Oh, he's great.

36:45.959 --> 36:47.209
Um...

36:48.876 --> 36:50.668
Clive.

36:50.751 --> 36:52.084
Clive.

36:52.251 --> 36:53.709
Clive, hm...

36:53.834 --> 36:56.543
- You want to talk about Clive?
- I don't, no.

36:56.709 --> 37:00.293
I mean, obviously he's a great bloke.
Lovely bloke, great choice.

37:00.418 --> 37:02.501
Look, I think I might scoot.

37:02.626 --> 37:05.501
- We should do that interview, though.
- Sure.

37:05.626 --> 37:08.626
Why don't you pop round to Manx TV tomorrow?

37:08.709 --> 37:09.959
Okay.

37:15.043 --> 37:16.876
- See you tomorrow.
- Wrong way.

37:16.959 --> 37:17.959
Yeah.

37:19.793 --> 37:21.001
Hey, Richie.

37:21.084 --> 37:23.834
I want to show you something.
You're gonna like it.

37:23.959 --> 37:27.626
- I've got to get to this funeral.
- Oh, hey, look at this, huh?

37:29.376 --> 37:31.376
- Memories, huh?
- Yes, sir.

37:31.501 --> 37:35.251
When I found her, she was on
the scrap heap. Can you believe that?

37:35.376 --> 37:39.959
She was pretty busted up. One careless owner.

37:40.084 --> 37:42.709
But then I brought her here, fixed her up,

37:42.793 --> 37:45.043
gave her the care and attention she needed,

37:45.126 --> 37:48.001
and now she goes like a dream.

37:49.001 --> 37:53.709
Take her out for a ride every single day.

37:55.084 --> 37:57.793
And then I fixed up the car.

38:01.459 --> 38:03.709
- I was talking about Pat.
- Yeah.

38:03.793 --> 38:05.709
- Not the car.
- Mm-hm, got it.

38:05.793 --> 38:08.584
- It was a double meaning and I was...
- Very good.

38:08.709 --> 38:10.043
- ...being funny.
- Yes.

38:10.209 --> 38:13.001
- But you didn't laugh.
- No, I'll laugh later.

38:13.126 --> 38:16.084
- That's okay.
- Well, thank you for the joke.

38:16.251 --> 38:18.709
Oh, no, no, no. Come and get your fan mail.

38:18.793 --> 38:20.959
Yes, just through here. Come on.

38:21.126 --> 38:23.293
- Yeah, step into my office.
- Okay.

38:23.418 --> 38:26.876
I didn't realise the show was so popular.
You get so many letters.

38:27.001 --> 38:30.043
Yeah, over the years
it's acquired a certain cachet.

38:31.709 --> 38:33.668
There.

38:35.709 --> 38:38.918
Phew! You want me to call a man with a van?

38:39.043 --> 38:41.209
- Very witty.
- Yeah.

38:41.334 --> 38:42.709
- Yeah.
- I did two jokes.

38:42.793 --> 38:46.418
- One over there and one just now.
- I see you're very proud of yourself.

38:46.543 --> 38:48.626
- A little bit.
- You know what you are?

38:48.709 --> 38:51.626
You are my stuntman.
That's all you'll ever be.

38:51.709 --> 38:54.584
- That's my job, though, so...
- What, to be my stand-in?

38:54.709 --> 38:57.209
I stand in when people
can't do things physically.

38:57.334 --> 38:58.834
That's when they call me.

38:58.959 --> 39:00.876
I'm at the top of my physical game.

39:01.001 --> 39:03.376
Well, you're hiding it
really well these days.

39:03.501 --> 39:05.376
Don't make me unleash the Ginga.

39:05.501 --> 39:08.418
Ginga? You're going to play
giant wooden blocks with me?

39:08.501 --> 39:10.709
Ginga not Jenga. It's a Capoeira term.

39:10.793 --> 39:12.793
It could get messy, sir.

39:12.918 --> 39:15.418
Enjoy the fan mail.
Don't read it all at once.

39:17.959 --> 39:20.084
You forgot your flowers.

39:21.709 --> 39:23.293
Oh, sweet.

39:24.959 --> 39:27.959
Hey, baby, I got you some flowers.

39:28.084 --> 39:29.418
Thanks.

39:29.543 --> 39:31.918
You know, just to say good luck
with the golf.

39:32.043 --> 39:34.834
"It's time to get some pussy."

39:37.418 --> 39:40.629
Well, it's been a while.

39:40.709 --> 39:43.376
- I'm going to play golf.
- I'll do some gardening.

39:47.709 --> 39:49.959
- Oh, it's nice.
- Don't.

39:54.251 --> 39:57.209
- Do you, er, fancy a toot?
- I'm going to say no to that.

39:57.334 --> 39:58.709
In public, especially.

39:58.793 --> 40:01.668
I had to give that up
due to adverse chemical reactions.

40:01.751 --> 40:04.543
- Let's make some fucking deals!
- Yes, let's do that.

40:04.668 --> 40:07.584
Listen, I might take a lead in there,
do the talking.

40:07.709 --> 40:10.626
- You could perhaps hang back.
- Me? I'm not going in.

40:10.709 --> 40:12.209
- You're not?
- No, I'm barred.

40:12.334 --> 40:14.126
Oh, you didn't mention that either.

40:14.293 --> 40:15.793
- It's a long story.
- Okay, Jeff.

40:15.918 --> 40:17.584
- See you after.
- See you later.

40:17.709 --> 40:19.793
- Still got some stuff...
- Oh, right.

40:22.376 --> 40:24.251
Hello, sir.

40:34.001 --> 40:35.501
What a twat!

40:37.584 --> 40:39.709
Richard Horncroft!

40:40.668 --> 40:42.293
The Beastman.

40:42.418 --> 40:44.834
Be careful, ladies.
This guy is a real live wire.

40:44.959 --> 40:46.584
Dangerous to know.

40:47.376 --> 40:48.959
- Twang!
- Ooh!

40:52.209 --> 40:55.251
Ah... So, where have you been hiding?

40:55.376 --> 40:57.001
Inside a busy schedule.

40:57.126 --> 40:58.834
- Really?
- Mm.

41:00.001 --> 41:02.001
- How am I looking?
- You're looking good.

41:02.126 --> 41:03.334
Yeah, I know.

41:03.459 --> 41:07.293
A little dick bird tells me you got an idea
floating around in the old bonsai.

41:07.418 --> 41:08.668
I certainly do.

41:08.793 --> 41:11.459
The heat I'm about to generate
from the police thing,

41:11.584 --> 41:15.418
I think could be funnelled through
into a DVD release.

41:15.501 --> 41:18.709
- That's where you come in.
- That's a sweet angle.

41:18.793 --> 41:21.751
So, what do you think?
Are we in business on this?

41:25.543 --> 41:27.584
I say, yeah, let's do it, let's sign.

41:28.751 --> 41:30.209
All right.

41:31.376 --> 41:33.126
Thanks, Coco.

41:33.251 --> 41:35.709
Pete, I like the way you do business.

41:36.626 --> 41:39.709
- We're heading back to the big time.
- There you are.

41:41.209 --> 41:43.584
Before we seal this puppy,

41:43.668 --> 41:46.209
is there anything else you want to run by me?

41:46.376 --> 41:49.543
No. I think we're good to go, yeah?

41:49.668 --> 41:53.334
I mean, nothing that
you might have said, er... publicly?

41:55.126 --> 41:57.584
You called me "a stinking ham" on Wogan,

41:57.709 --> 42:00.084
"with the emotional range of a chair leg".

42:01.418 --> 42:04.709
- Did I say that?
- You've got brass balls, coming in here.

42:04.793 --> 42:06.793
I'll give you that.

42:06.918 --> 42:09.001
Okay, look, I just wanted to come here

42:09.209 --> 42:11.584
with an opportunity
for you to get involved in.

42:11.709 --> 42:14.043
In your pathetic career?

42:14.209 --> 42:17.543
You've gone too far.
I've got offers all over this island.

42:17.668 --> 42:20.876
- I don't need to go to you.
- I'm sure you're inundated

42:21.001 --> 42:24.876
with requests for the greatest actor
of his generation. Behold!

42:25.001 --> 42:27.918
'When you're head
of a busy multinational corporation,

42:28.043 --> 42:30.418

- Yeah? Something funny?
- You're finished.

42:45.709 --> 42:48.334
You fucked off to Hollywood 25 years ago,

42:48.459 --> 42:51.626
because some LA windbag said
you were the next Burt Reynolds.

42:51.709 --> 42:55.793
Yeah, you gambled and you lost.
You lost at life.

- You're in a dream world.
- I'm in a dream world?

43:00.293 --> 43:02.584
That's funny, because this is a dream world.

43:02.709 --> 43:06.918
You're living in a plastic palace.
None of this is real. This is not real.

43:07.001 --> 43:09.084
That's real, but this is not real!

43:09.251 --> 43:13.209
It's full of sycophants and prostitutes.

43:14.709 --> 43:17.251
You're a joke, Richard.

43:19.668 --> 43:21.543
Pat never charged me.

43:21.668 --> 43:23.668
That one was on the house.

43:30.251 --> 43:31.876
Sorry, I was not aiming for you.

43:31.959 --> 43:34.793
- Get Richard a skinny green.
- Shove it up your arse!

43:34.918 --> 43:37.126
Somebody call the police.

43:37.293 --> 43:39.251
- Eh?
- Get that cocaine.

43:39.376 --> 43:42.709
He's made one of the biggest
mistakes of his career.

43:43.459 --> 43:46.043
That's it, Richie. Get it down you!

43:46.793 --> 43:48.876
I love you.

43:52.084 --> 43:53.876
Do you remember this?

44:00.793 --> 44:03.376
And, action!

44:12.959 --> 44:14.876
'Up yours!'

44:15.001 --> 44:17.709
This island is a shithole!

44:29.126 --> 44:31.584
That was a classic night, Jeff.

44:36.751 --> 44:39.668
Can I get you an Alka-Seltzer?

44:39.751 --> 44:41.084
Oh, shit.

44:42.709 --> 44:46.626
If you ever set foot on this island again,
you're going to jail.

44:46.709 --> 44:49.543
- Is this about your wife?
- What?

44:49.709 --> 44:53.376
We've never forgotten what you said
about the Isle of Man on Wogan.

44:53.501 --> 44:57.501
You said that we had a limited gene pool.

44:57.626 --> 44:59.501
Well, you do.

44:59.626 --> 45:02.751
And you have nothing on me, because...

45:04.209 --> 45:06.334
You're joking, aren't you?

45:06.459 --> 45:09.626
I could bang you up
just for the vandalism alone.

45:09.709 --> 45:11.334
Yes!

45:12.959 --> 45:14.584
What vandalism?

45:14.709 --> 45:17.918
On this side, we have a penis here.
You can see the scrotum.

45:18.043 --> 45:20.001
In Holland, we call this the acorn.

45:20.126 --> 45:22.959
You've got breasts.
A phallus, this time with sputum.

45:23.084 --> 45:25.793
I don't know what this is.

45:25.918 --> 45:29.543
- That's an anus.
- No, I think it's a titty.

45:29.668 --> 45:33.668
All right, Richard.
You just wait here and I will get the car.

45:33.751 --> 45:38.251
Oh, hey, Rich. Hey, settle an argument.
What is this here? Is it an anus?

45:38.376 --> 45:41.001
I don't know what that is.
It's nothing to do with me.

45:41.084 --> 45:43.251
You signed it, you moron.

45:43.376 --> 45:46.084
- Well, I can speak English.
- And now he's racist.

45:46.251 --> 45:48.626
So, write this down: racist.

45:52.959 --> 45:54.876
I nearly believed you for a minute.

45:55.001 --> 45:58.751
Look, I came here to help the police
and just things went a bit wrong.

45:58.834 --> 46:01.084
You came back to get publicity from a murder.

46:01.251 --> 46:04.876
- That's not why I came back.
- Stop lying to yourself, Richard.

46:05.001 --> 46:08.501
And you're not lying to yourself?
Serious journalism?

46:08.626 --> 46:12.043
Manx cats with no tails?
Pat, you used to be an artist.

46:12.209 --> 46:14.334
I was a piece of totty in a shit TV show.

46:14.459 --> 46:16.918
Mindhorn was not a shit TV show.

46:22.709 --> 46:27.043
Hey, Richie, you keep
leaving things at the house,

46:27.209 --> 46:29.709
your jacket, Pat, your dignity.

46:29.793 --> 46:32.959
You think you've got it all.
You think you've got it all sewn up.

46:33.084 --> 46:34.959
What you've got is a domestic prison.

46:35.084 --> 46:38.334
- Better than a real prison.
- You've got your wife and daughter.

46:38.418 --> 46:40.293
I've got freedom. I go with the wind.

46:40.418 --> 46:41.834
- Jasmine isn't mine.
- What?

46:41.959 --> 46:44.084
Jasmine isn't mine. Pat never told you?

46:44.293 --> 46:45.959
Pat didn't tell me what?

46:46.084 --> 46:47.876
What about Jasmine?

46:48.001 --> 46:50.209
Richard.

46:50.793 --> 46:53.668
Yeah, bye, Richard. Nice to see you.

46:53.751 --> 46:56.251
- He's a very confused man.
- Tell me about it.

46:56.376 --> 46:59.584
- He didn't even know about Jasmine.
- Your daughter?

46:59.709 --> 47:02.418
She's not my daughter. I've had the snip.

47:02.543 --> 47:05.376
No, she's Peter Easterman's daughter.

47:06.293 --> 47:08.668
- You had the snip, Green?
- No.

47:08.751 --> 47:10.668
Something to think about.

47:30.293 --> 47:34.251
Well, we got our man.
Hopefully that makes up for the graffiti.

47:34.376 --> 47:38.251
- Maybe under different circumstances...
- Yeah, thanks. Bye.

51:06.293 --> 51:08.959
Oh, he lives in a flat.

51:09.084 --> 51:12.418
Well, what about me?
I want what is due to me.

51:12.543 --> 51:17.584
I want a Bentley convertible.
I want a trophy wife.

51:17.668 --> 51:23.709
I want a fucking infinity pool.

51:25.251 --> 51:29.709
Jeff, it's okay.
It's not as bad as you think, okay?

51:29.793 --> 51:33.251
Things aren't that bad.
There's a silver lining to every cloud.

51:33.376 --> 51:36.293
No, you don't, you sneaky bastard.

51:36.376 --> 51:38.793
Not this time. You owe me.

51:38.918 --> 51:41.209
We need to take a step back here, Jeff.

51:41.334 --> 51:45.043
A mentally fragile young man
is calling for my help.

51:45.209 --> 51:46.959
Yesterday you said he was a retard.

51:47.084 --> 51:50.626
I've seen a few things since then.
Maybe my eyes have been opened.

51:50.709 --> 51:53.459
- What are you talking about?
- I'm a father, Jeff.

51:54.001 --> 51:57.459
- I've sired a daughter, with Pat.
- What, Jasmine?

51:58.668 --> 52:01.334
You idiot! She could have been anyone's,

52:01.459 --> 52:03.918
the way Pat put it about after you left!

52:05.709 --> 52:07.584
You take that back.

52:07.668 --> 52:11.626
- Aye, I'm sorry.
- You take a long hard look at yourself.

52:11.709 --> 52:15.126
I'm sorry, I'm not thinking straight.

52:15.293 --> 52:17.334
- Give me the tape.
- Okay.

52:20.626 --> 52:23.001
You're doing the right thing, Jeff.

52:25.584 --> 52:26.584
Truth time.

52:30.501 --> 52:34.251
'Mindhorn, the best detective
the Isle of Man had ever seen.'

52:34.918 --> 52:37.959
Out of the way! Coming through!

52:43.043 --> 52:45.543
Oh, God, no.

52:45.709 --> 52:47.126
Jasmine.

52:47.251 --> 52:48.418
I'm sorry.

52:48.543 --> 52:50.251
What for?

52:50.334 --> 52:51.918
Everything.

52:52.043 --> 52:54.043
You know about me and your mother

52:54.209 --> 52:56.626
- and who I am?
- Yes, yes, sadly I do.

52:56.709 --> 52:59.584
I want you to know I'm proud of you, Jas.

52:59.668 --> 53:01.209
- Can I call you Jas?
- No.

53:01.376 --> 53:04.043
Jasmine, I want us to get to know
each other really well.

53:04.209 --> 53:06.126
- This is weird.
- I know it's weird.

53:06.293 --> 53:08.293
I want us to set up regular phone calls.

53:08.418 --> 53:10.043
That's never going to happen.

53:10.126 --> 53:11.668
Okay, we'll go at your pace.

53:11.793 --> 53:16.709
Watch the news. You're going to see
your daddy blow the lid off this island.

53:24.376 --> 53:27.918
'So, to sum up, do we have a deal, then?'

53:28.043 --> 53:32.876
- I don't take very kindly to blackmail.
- 'All right, keep your wig on.'

53:34.001 --> 53:36.043
Okay, I'll see you there.

53:36.751 --> 53:40.084
- So the simpleton was filming us?
- Yeah, looks like it.

53:41.918 --> 53:46.334
I'm starting to think
framing Melly was a really bad idea.

53:46.459 --> 53:48.293
Get me Mindhorn!

53:48.418 --> 53:50.793
Mindhorn!

53:50.918 --> 53:53.543
Do you have a statement to make about this?

53:53.668 --> 53:57.959
'The Isle of Man is still one of the safest
and most tranquil tourist destinations.'

53:58.084 --> 53:59.084
Hello!

54:01.709 --> 54:05.293
Mindhorn's here!
I've got this, Chief. Stand your men down.

54:07.418 --> 54:09.001
'Is this the camera?

54:09.126 --> 54:11.376
'This man is innocent.

54:11.501 --> 54:14.001
'This tape will be the proof of my words.

54:15.043 --> 54:16.709
'You might want to swing a lens.'

54:16.793 --> 54:19.668
- Richard, what the hell are you doing?
- Trust me.

54:20.251 --> 54:23.834
Get one of your boffins to play this.
It shows that Melly's innocent.

54:23.959 --> 54:25.459
How do I look?

54:25.584 --> 54:27.376
Like you might need some help.

54:27.501 --> 54:29.626
Too late. I work alone.

54:31.334 --> 54:34.709
I'm coming, Melly,
Detective Mindhorn's on the case.

54:34.834 --> 54:36.334
Mindhorn!

54:39.834 --> 54:42.043
Shit, Jesus.

54:44.043 --> 54:45.668
Oh, God.

54:47.376 --> 54:49.001
Hiya, Mindhorn.

54:49.126 --> 54:50.876
Mindhorn?

54:51.001 --> 54:53.459
Is this still Operation
Apocalypse of Justice?

54:53.584 --> 54:55.501
I know you're innocent.

54:55.626 --> 54:57.709
This man is innocent. Play the tape.

54:57.834 --> 55:00.751
We'll play the tape at the station.

55:00.876 --> 55:03.668
No, I'm not going down the station.
Play the tape now.

55:03.751 --> 55:06.918
- Play it now.
- He's serious, Patricia.

55:07.043 --> 55:09.751
And so am I. Okay, people.

55:09.834 --> 55:12.626
Get ready to witness some truth bombs.

55:12.709 --> 55:16.001
'Ho, ho, ho!
You know how to do it, don't you?'

55:16.709 --> 55:17.501
What?

55:17.626 --> 55:19.751
'I'm gonna shit the truth out, bang!'

55:19.918 --> 55:23.084
- This is the wrong tape.
- 'My name is Bruce Mindhorn.'

55:23.251 --> 55:24.626
He swapped the tapes, okay?

55:24.709 --> 55:28.043
Jeff Moncrief, who I will kill,
has got the real tape.

55:28.251 --> 55:31.043
It's in the caravan.
We have to go to the caravan.

55:31.793 --> 55:34.001
We'll do that when you both come down.

55:34.709 --> 55:37.001
Richard, is Melly armed?

55:37.126 --> 55:39.084
No, no, no, negative.

55:39.251 --> 55:40.501
No, I have got a gun.

55:42.126 --> 55:44.126
This is not a gun, it's not real.

55:44.251 --> 55:46.709
- It is real.
- It's not real.

55:46.793 --> 55:48.751
- It's a toy.
- It's not a toy.

55:49.543 --> 55:50.834
See? Told you.

55:50.959 --> 55:52.251
- Go, man.
- Shoot.

55:54.084 --> 55:56.876
- Quick! This way, Mindhorn.
- This is not the way to go.

55:58.543 --> 56:00.751
- 'Call Equity!'
- What's the hoo-ha?

56:00.876 --> 56:04.251
- Thorncroft's gone insane.
- This is terrible.

56:04.376 --> 56:06.918
- Wait, did he sign that DVD thing?
- Yeah.

56:07.043 --> 56:08.543
In which case it's fantastic.

56:09.084 --> 56:10.709
Stop shooting.

56:10.876 --> 56:12.334
I haven't done anything.

56:12.418 --> 56:15.459
Stop making that stupid bird noise.

56:15.543 --> 56:16.834
Stop there.

56:18.001 --> 56:19.959
- Stop.
- They're heading into the mine.

56:21.709 --> 56:22.876
Stop right there.

56:34.834 --> 56:36.793
They've gone again, Chief.

56:36.959 --> 56:37.959
For now.

56:59.001 --> 57:01.293
DS Baines?

57:01.376 --> 57:03.251
Clever boy.

57:03.376 --> 57:05.501
You're coming with me.

57:06.376 --> 57:09.501
All I want to know is,
who else has seen this tape?

57:09.626 --> 57:13.501
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I can't reveal my sources.

57:13.626 --> 57:17.751
It was Richard Thorncroft.
This whole thing was his idea.

57:17.876 --> 57:20.543
- And possibly Pat Deville.
- Pat Deville?

57:20.709 --> 57:22.876
He picked it up from her house.

57:23.626 --> 57:25.293
How about 30 grand?

57:25.376 --> 57:26.918
Oh, Jeff.

57:27.584 --> 57:30.751
The last person who tried to blackmail me

57:30.876 --> 57:32.376
is on this tape.

57:32.501 --> 57:36.501
Only I haven't had
a torrid affair with you, Jeff.

57:36.626 --> 57:39.459
Let's call it 50 quid.
Then everybody's happy, eh?

57:43.293 --> 57:44.293
Oh, great.

57:44.418 --> 57:47.459
This isn't the Bronx,
this is the Isle of Man.

57:57.709 --> 58:00.334
- You okay, Mindhorn?
- Oh, God. I'm going to be sick.

58:00.459 --> 58:02.459
Come on, this way to safety.

58:02.584 --> 58:04.084
- Where are we going?
- The nest.

58:04.251 --> 58:07.209
It's lucky you're Special Forces.

58:08.626 --> 58:11.084
- How much further?
- It's just here.

58:12.584 --> 58:14.584
- What's this?
- You've got to jump.

58:14.709 --> 58:17.709
Oh, yeah. Yeah, let's just jump off a cliff!

58:17.834 --> 58:19.751
Yeah! You first.

58:19.876 --> 58:22.043
No!

58:30.043 --> 58:32.668
'It now seems certain
actor Richard Thorncroft,

58:32.751 --> 58:35.709
'who disappeared two days ago, is dead.

58:35.834 --> 58:37.543
'Thorncroft is the chief suspect

58:37.668 --> 58:40.876
'in the murder of Mindhorn PR guru,
Jeffrey Moncrief.

58:41.001 --> 58:45.209
'It is now accepted that Thorncroft could
be suffering a severe mental breakdown

58:45.334 --> 58:48.334
'after a long career lull
since the hit show ended.'

58:48.459 --> 58:51.209
'Even a short walk can take its toll
on the lower legs.

58:51.376 --> 58:53.459
'That's why I use Thrombi-Sox.'

58:53.584 --> 58:55.709
'Jeffrey Moncrief, who I will kill...'

58:56.709 --> 59:02.293
'You can never say it's a good thing
when someone is dead,

59:02.418 --> 59:07.668
'but maybe with Richard
this has been for the best.'

59:07.751 --> 59:12.126
'I keep expecting him
to walk through the door and say,

59:12.293 --> 59:15.334
""Hey, Pete, old buddy,
how are the DVD sales going?"

59:15.459 --> 59:20.126
'Because, of course, Mindhorn
is finally released today on DVD.

59:20.293 --> 59:21.376
'Yeah.

59:21.543 --> 59:24.584
'Actually, could you stop filming?
I think I'm about to cry.'

59:24.709 --> 59:29.293
'Time in the recording studio
yielded this album from 1990.

59:29.418 --> 59:32.543
'His signature tune,
"Can't Handcuff The Wind",

59:32.668 --> 59:36.001
'reached No.1
in several East European countries.'

59:47.668 --> 59:50.709
Oh, yeah. Oh, you're gonna love this.

59:51.293 --> 59:54.709
I've made you look exactly how you used to.

01:00:00.334 --> 01:00:02.543
Oh, it's perfect.

01:00:04.709 --> 01:00:06.959
- I can't move.
- I glued you into your clothes.

01:00:07.084 --> 01:00:09.834
There's three rolls of masking tape
around your neck.

01:00:09.959 --> 01:00:14.043
- You glued me into my clothes?
- Your hair came off in the sea.

01:00:14.209 --> 01:00:17.543
- But it's okay because I stuck it back on.
- I can't breathe.

01:00:17.668 --> 01:00:20.584
With superglue
so it will never come off again.

01:00:22.834 --> 01:00:24.084
Good, isn't it?

01:00:25.209 --> 01:00:27.209
And your eye patch.

01:00:27.334 --> 01:00:30.584
- Where are we?
- We are in an underground lair, the nest.

01:00:30.709 --> 01:00:33.876
And this is where we complete

01:00:34.001 --> 01:00:37.209
Operation Apocalypse of Justice.

01:00:37.334 --> 01:00:39.793
Right, first we need a penknife

01:00:39.918 --> 01:00:42.543
and this recorder belt.

01:00:42.668 --> 01:00:44.626
'Recorder belt.'

01:00:44.709 --> 01:00:46.751
Fake blood for fooling the baddies.

01:00:46.918 --> 01:00:49.584
And... a pretend gun.

01:00:50.459 --> 01:00:52.709
I'm your partner and we're working on a case.

01:00:52.793 --> 01:00:54.918
And it's a good case, isn't it, Mindhorn?

01:00:55.043 --> 01:00:57.501
Yeah, it's a really good case.

01:00:57.626 --> 01:01:01.126
Just one small problem is, I'm not Mindhorn.

01:01:01.293 --> 01:01:04.043
There is no Mindhorn. Mindhorn isn't real.

01:01:04.209 --> 01:01:06.126
It is real.

01:01:07.334 --> 01:01:09.876
- Truth powder.
- That is merchandise, okay?

01:01:10.001 --> 01:01:13.543
Do you know what merchandise is?
Cheap rubbish we sell to idiots.

01:01:13.668 --> 01:01:18.709
And by the way, that nearly blinded
four teenagers in Whitby in 1989.

01:01:18.793 --> 01:01:22.751
Mindhorn is a fictional character
in a show I did a quarter of a century ago.

01:01:23.501 --> 01:01:25.834
- What's a fictional character?
- I'm an actor.

01:01:25.918 --> 01:01:28.668
I used to be.
Now I just advertise orthopaedic socks.

01:01:28.751 --> 01:01:31.709
I don't even do that now
because John Nettle's got the gig!

01:01:32.334 --> 01:01:34.751
I don't... I don't understand.

01:01:34.918 --> 01:01:37.209
You don't understand? Let me clear things up.

01:01:37.334 --> 01:01:40.293
Your parents carked it,
you lost your marbles,

01:01:40.418 --> 01:01:43.543
you got fixated with me
in some weird, creepy way

01:01:43.626 --> 01:01:45.001
I don't want to get into,

01:01:45.126 --> 01:01:49.293
you think I'm here to rescue you
but I am a self-obsessed arsehole.

01:01:49.459 --> 01:01:50.793
Does that clear things up?

01:01:50.876 --> 01:01:54.501
'Paul Melly, wanted in connection
with the murder of Katya Lipinskii,

01:01:54.668 --> 01:01:56.084
'is also presumed dead.

01:01:56.251 --> 01:01:59.459
'Melly, 32, is believed
to have a mental age of nine.'

01:01:59.584 --> 01:02:01.293
Who's going to clear my name?

01:02:01.376 --> 01:02:02.376
Nobody.

01:02:03.751 --> 01:02:05.251
There's no evidence.

01:02:05.376 --> 01:02:07.793
We had a tape. The tape's gone. It's over.

01:02:10.126 --> 01:02:12.126
Both of them?

01:02:13.084 --> 01:02:14.668
Both of them?

01:02:14.751 --> 01:02:17.376
- What do you mean, both of them?
- I made a copy.

01:02:18.126 --> 01:02:21.084
You taught me that. Always make a copy.

01:02:21.251 --> 01:02:25.126
Well, Mindhorn did, only you're not Mindhorn.

01:02:25.293 --> 01:02:26.501
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:02:26.626 --> 01:02:28.043
I am Mindhorn.

01:02:28.709 --> 01:02:31.668
- What? But you said...
- You passed the test.

01:02:31.751 --> 01:02:33.251
Kestrel, well done.

01:02:34.293 --> 01:02:36.209
- Did I?
- You made promotion, partner.

01:02:36.376 --> 01:02:39.793
From now on you shall be known as the Falcon.

01:02:39.876 --> 01:02:41.376
No, I prefer Kestrel.

01:02:41.543 --> 01:02:43.293
Kestrel's fine. Where's the tape?

01:02:43.418 --> 01:02:47.084
I made a copy of the tape and
put it in your car at Mindhorn Heights.

01:02:47.209 --> 01:02:48.209
Yes!

01:02:48.293 --> 01:02:51.918
I'm going to pack the bag
for the finale when we kill the baddies.

01:02:52.043 --> 01:02:55.709
Sounds like a plan, partner.
I'll give you a signal when I need you.

01:02:55.834 --> 01:02:57.876
- What's the signal?
- You'll hear it.

01:02:58.001 --> 01:03:00.584
I need to hear it now.

01:03:00.709 --> 01:03:02.668
No.

01:03:02.751 --> 01:03:04.459
- Better.
- Good, okay.

01:03:04.584 --> 01:03:06.876
- Here, make sure you wear it.
- What is that?

01:03:06.959 --> 01:03:09.376
- It's a recorder belt.
- Recorder belt, okay.

01:03:09.501 --> 01:03:11.626
- Strapping that on now.
- And this.

01:03:11.751 --> 01:03:13.793
Roger that. Weird plastic radio. Got it.

01:03:13.918 --> 01:03:16.751
- Er, does this work?
- No.

01:03:16.918 --> 01:03:19.751
- It does work, actually, FYI.
- Oh, right.

01:03:22.418 --> 01:03:23.918
Who are you calling?

01:03:24.043 --> 01:03:25.793
The only person we can trust.

01:03:36.418 --> 01:03:38.418
- Baines.
- Richard, wow!

01:03:38.543 --> 01:03:40.043
- Don't ask.
- You're alive.

01:03:40.209 --> 01:03:41.751
- Where's Melly?
- In a cave.

01:03:41.918 --> 01:03:43.543
He hid a copy of the tape at Pat's.

01:03:44.376 --> 01:03:45.418
Whereabouts?

01:03:45.501 --> 01:03:48.626
In the garage, in the glove compartment
of the Mindhorn car.

01:03:49.918 --> 01:03:53.084
- What have you got the gun for?
- You know too much, Richard.

01:03:54.043 --> 01:03:57.126
I don't know anything.
I'm actually quite confused.

01:03:57.293 --> 01:04:01.084
- You know that I killed Moncrief, right?
- I did not know that.

01:04:01.209 --> 01:04:04.126
- Well, you do now.
- Not a problem. I can blank it out.

01:04:04.251 --> 01:04:07.418
I have that capacity.
I've blanked out huge chapters of my life.

01:04:07.543 --> 01:04:10.209
- This is just one more thing.
- Sorry, Richard.

01:04:10.334 --> 01:04:11.334
Final curtain.

01:04:20.876 --> 01:04:22.668
Truth powder.

01:04:24.834 --> 01:04:26.459
- Quick, the gun.
- What is that?

01:04:26.584 --> 01:04:27.668
Come on!

01:04:29.293 --> 01:04:32.709
- Jesus Christ!
- She's left the keys in the bike.

01:04:34.418 --> 01:04:35.918
Yes!

01:04:36.084 --> 01:04:37.584
Why did you do that?

01:04:37.668 --> 01:04:41.209
We could have used the bike
to get away, you stupid berk!

01:04:51.251 --> 01:04:54.334
- Hello.
- 'Hi, Pat, it's DS Baines here.'

01:04:54.459 --> 01:04:57.584
I just thought I should tell you
that Richard is alive.

01:04:58.793 --> 01:05:01.959
- He's alive?
- 'Alive, yeah, yeah. Great news.'

01:05:02.126 --> 01:05:05.293
Um, mixed bag, though. He is delusional.

01:05:05.418 --> 01:05:07.459
Oh, God, he's seriously ill, isn't he?

01:05:07.584 --> 01:05:10.084
'He is, he is. He's on his way to you now.

01:05:10.251 --> 01:05:12.709
'He thinks he's in an old episode of Mindhorn

01:05:12.793 --> 01:05:15.251
'and I need you to keep him there

01:05:15.376 --> 01:05:18.626
'and I will come to you, okay,
so just wait there.'

01:05:22.501 --> 01:05:24.084
Where's the car?

01:05:25.668 --> 01:05:27.459
Oh, where is it?

01:05:27.584 --> 01:05:29.918
Where's the bloody car?

01:05:30.043 --> 01:05:32.209
It should be here.

01:05:45.293 --> 01:05:46.334
Richard?

01:05:48.334 --> 01:05:49.501
Are you okay?

01:05:53.293 --> 01:05:54.293
No.

01:05:54.418 --> 01:05:57.709
I'm having a really bad day. Where's my car?

01:05:57.793 --> 01:05:59.876
Why don't you just come and sit down?

01:06:00.001 --> 01:06:02.209
I can't sit down. I'm glued in.

01:06:02.334 --> 01:06:03.876
Just calm down and...

01:06:04.001 --> 01:06:05.751
Baines is trying to kill me.

01:06:05.876 --> 01:06:08.668
She's corrupt. There's a bald man.

01:06:08.793 --> 01:06:12.084
He's... he's got cats on his shoes.
I've seen them.

01:06:12.251 --> 01:06:15.043
Not real cats, false cats,
tiny false cats on his shoes.

01:06:15.209 --> 01:06:17.126
Richard, none of this is real.

01:06:17.293 --> 01:06:19.876
It's all real, it's come real.

01:06:20.001 --> 01:06:21.671
Where's my car? Where's it gone?

01:06:21.751 --> 01:06:26.834
The car? Clive is bringing the car.
It will be here in a few minutes.

01:06:26.918 --> 01:06:30.084
Now, just calm down and talk to me.

01:06:30.251 --> 01:06:33.418
- They're coming. I can't wait.
- Let's talk about us.

01:06:33.543 --> 01:06:34.626
There is no us.

01:06:34.709 --> 01:06:38.418
I blew it. I walked out.
The only thing that ever meant anything.

01:06:38.501 --> 01:06:39.834
You.

01:06:40.959 --> 01:06:45.334
Since I left you,
my life has been... really quite bad.

01:06:45.459 --> 01:06:48.793
Richard, it's all right. It's all right.

01:06:48.876 --> 01:06:51.918
Leaving you was
the biggest mistake of my life.

01:06:54.334 --> 01:06:55.751
What is that?

01:06:56.584 --> 01:06:57.584
The Kestrel.

01:06:58.793 --> 01:07:01.751
Sorry, I'm so sorry.

01:07:05.418 --> 01:07:09.043
So he's not dead,
he just fell asleep on the sunbed.

01:07:09.251 --> 01:07:10.959
Put down the gardening equipment.

01:07:11.084 --> 01:07:16.459
Get out of my house before I strim
that stupid fucking wig off.

01:07:16.626 --> 01:07:20.126
Where's my car?

01:07:20.293 --> 01:07:21.959
Don't tell him, Clive.

01:07:23.043 --> 01:07:26.626
- Pete took it for the parade.
- What's going on?

01:07:26.709 --> 01:07:28.543
Stay away. His brain's come loose.

01:07:28.668 --> 01:07:30.668
Whatever happens next,

01:07:30.751 --> 01:07:32.709
I want you to remember two things.

01:07:32.793 --> 01:07:34.543
One, I'm innocent.

01:07:35.584 --> 01:07:36.918
And two,

01:07:37.876 --> 01:07:39.334
Daddy loves you.

01:07:45.418 --> 01:07:47.459
Oh, shit. Oh, no. Oh, dear.

01:07:47.584 --> 01:07:50.709
These are nothing to do with me.
Dirty, dirty Richard.

01:07:50.876 --> 01:07:53.918
- You're pathetic.
- These aren't mine.

01:07:54.084 --> 01:07:55.501
What are all these?

01:07:55.584 --> 01:07:57.876
They're from my pen pal in France.

01:08:02.668 --> 01:08:04.584
These are all from Richard.

01:08:04.709 --> 01:08:06.543
I was trying to protect you, Pat.

01:08:08.084 --> 01:08:09.751
The man is poison.

01:08:11.709 --> 01:08:13.209
I'm going to work.

01:08:18.584 --> 01:08:22.251
- There she blows.
- And a load of fake Mindhorns.

01:08:27.542 --> 01:08:30.876
I really do think this could be
the best Manx Day we've ever had.

01:08:30.959 --> 01:08:34.334
- Sorry I'm late.
- Better late than never.

01:08:35.834 --> 01:08:40.001
I'll be making my speech
slightly later than scheduled.

01:08:40.126 --> 01:08:43.084
Um, I provided copies for you all.

01:08:43.251 --> 01:08:46.126
They're on the table in the entrance hall.

01:08:46.292 --> 01:08:49.792
Thanks, everyone. Go and join the madness.

01:08:49.917 --> 01:08:51.251
All right?

01:08:51.417 --> 01:08:52.959
Okay, thanks.

01:08:56.126 --> 01:08:58.126
Pat, could I have a word?

01:09:11.334 --> 01:09:13.084
Pat, Pat, Pat, Pat, Pat, Pat...

01:09:14.751 --> 01:09:17.584
You know, don't you?

01:09:22.709 --> 01:09:25.459
I'm in a bit of a pickle, aren't I?

01:09:25.584 --> 01:09:29.251
I mean, you're a journalist,
you're not going to keep it to yourself,

01:09:29.334 --> 01:09:30.917
something this big.

01:09:31.792 --> 01:09:34.667
How can I let you leave this room?

01:09:34.751 --> 01:09:39.459
I absolutely cannot have people
finding out that I am bald.

01:09:46.917 --> 01:09:50.001
I think bald men are sexy.

01:09:51.876 --> 01:09:53.084
I think you're right.

01:09:53.209 --> 01:09:56.709
Oh, I'll have to take this.

01:09:57.751 --> 01:10:01.293
'The tape's in the parade.
I'm going after them.'

01:10:03.918 --> 01:10:05.751
She knows.

01:10:12.418 --> 01:10:16.626
Welcome, one and all, to the Manx Day parade.

01:10:16.751 --> 01:10:19.293
We're going to have some great fun.

01:10:19.418 --> 01:10:21.418
Thank you.

01:10:22.001 --> 01:10:26.084
I wonder who's going to win
today's Float of the Year competition.

01:10:26.251 --> 01:10:29.001
Could it be the really big spider,

01:10:29.126 --> 01:10:32.251
or the two massive papier-mâché heads?

01:10:32.418 --> 01:10:35.626
Or perhaps the crazy caterpillar,
runner-up last year?

01:10:35.709 --> 01:10:38.959
Fingers crossed for no more trapped ankles.

01:10:39.043 --> 01:10:43.709
And there's Trevor
in his intergalactic mobility scooter.

01:10:44.251 --> 01:10:48.126
The Windjammer float there, always good fun.

01:10:48.293 --> 01:10:52.626
It's the most successful TV programme
ever made on the Isle of Man.

01:10:52.709 --> 01:10:55.709
Oh, and look, it's the villain,

01:10:55.793 --> 01:10:59.084
but Windjammer disarms him and saves the day.

01:10:59.251 --> 01:11:00.834
Super stuff.

01:11:00.918 --> 01:11:04.543
And, new this year, the Mindhorn contingent.

01:11:04.709 --> 01:11:06.876
Remember Mindhorn, folks?

01:11:07.001 --> 01:11:10.876
Mindhorn, of course,
originally played by, um...

01:11:11.001 --> 01:11:14.001
Oh, and who's this? Another Mindhorn.

01:11:14.126 --> 01:11:18.251
And a crazy person, a sort of chicken man.

01:11:26.293 --> 01:11:29.876
I don't remember the episode,
"Mindhorn and the Chicken Man".

01:11:30.001 --> 01:11:32.543
What's Mindhorn doing now?

01:11:32.668 --> 01:11:38.126
No doubt finding some crucial piece
of evidence to uncover the truth.

01:11:39.251 --> 01:11:43.293
And here comes the baddie. Oh, no!

01:11:46.626 --> 01:11:48.001
Wonderful lookalike.

01:11:48.126 --> 01:11:53.293
Doesn't she look like Manx TV's
very own Pat Deville?

01:11:55.584 --> 01:11:57.668
- Go, go, go!
- I can't make it go.

01:11:57.793 --> 01:12:00.584
I knew you hadn't passed your test,
you naughty liar.

01:12:01.084 --> 01:12:05.834
You can take my woman,
but you can't take my fucking car.

01:12:05.959 --> 01:12:07.709
- It won't go.
- The handbrake's on.

01:12:07.834 --> 01:12:09.084
Where's the handbrake?

01:12:09.293 --> 01:12:11.001
- There!
- Like a Formula 1 champion!

01:12:12.293 --> 01:12:14.918
Oh, shit!

01:12:15.959 --> 01:12:19.709
Fantastic! Full marks to the stuntman.

01:12:19.834 --> 01:12:22.334
- I wasn't ready.
- I can't actually drive.

01:12:22.459 --> 01:12:23.959
- Get out!
- I never learned.

01:12:24.084 --> 01:12:26.251
- Oh, shut up!
- Never had to.

01:12:26.334 --> 01:12:28.876
I was driven everywhere
so I didn't have to bother.

01:12:29.043 --> 01:12:30.501
Hi, yep, hello.

01:12:32.918 --> 01:12:36.209
And here's the baddie retrieving her gun.

01:12:36.376 --> 01:12:38.584
- Get in the car!
- What?

01:12:38.709 --> 01:12:40.793
- Oh!
- Classic!

01:12:43.043 --> 01:12:45.876
And now for the nail-biting finale...

01:12:48.709 --> 01:12:51.043
Oh, bad luck, baddie.

01:12:51.209 --> 01:12:54.293
And that's Mindhorn,
winner of the day in my view.

01:12:55.418 --> 01:12:56.751
Great stuff!

01:13:02.251 --> 01:13:05.876
We're flying to the truth!

01:13:22.834 --> 01:13:27.001
What are we doing? It's a dead-end.
Where are we?

01:13:28.126 --> 01:13:30.376
- This is your cove, Mindhorn.
- What?

01:13:30.543 --> 01:13:33.709
- Where do we go from here?
- Well, the tunnels!

01:13:34.751 --> 01:13:36.251
- Melly.
- Melly, come on.

01:13:41.126 --> 01:13:43.001
What's wrong?

01:13:44.043 --> 01:13:47.001
That was... That was great, wasn't it?

01:13:48.251 --> 01:13:50.001
You've been shot.

01:13:50.126 --> 01:13:52.543
- You're bleeding.
- No, no, no. Don't worry.

01:13:52.668 --> 01:13:54.918
It's fake blood.

01:13:55.043 --> 01:13:58.376
- Oh, no, that's there.
- We have to get you some help.

01:13:59.001 --> 01:14:01.834
- I'm dying, Mindhorn.
- No, no, you're not.

01:14:01.959 --> 01:14:03.709
- This is the end.
- No.

01:14:03.876 --> 01:14:07.626
- Go on without me. Leave me here.
- I'm not leaving you.

01:14:09.793 --> 01:14:11.709
Because I'm a good partner?

01:14:11.793 --> 01:14:15.459
You're the best damn partner
a man could ask for, Kestrel.

01:14:15.584 --> 01:14:17.751
Your parents would be proud of you.

01:14:17.834 --> 01:14:19.626
I'm proud of you.

01:14:20.876 --> 01:14:22.459
Thanks, Mindhorn.

01:14:23.668 --> 01:14:26.334
It's been an honour to be your partner.

01:14:27.834 --> 01:14:30.668
Well, it's the best 15 minutes of my life.

01:14:32.668 --> 01:14:35.793
Here's a copy of the tape. Now, go.

01:14:35.918 --> 01:14:40.209
Promise me you'll clear my name, Mindhorn.

01:14:40.793 --> 01:14:43.126
- I promise.
- And promise me...

01:14:43.293 --> 01:14:46.459
you two will finally get it together.

01:14:46.626 --> 01:14:49.459
- Mm-hm.
- I'm sorry, I can't promise you that.

01:14:49.584 --> 01:14:52.251
I mean... yes.

01:14:53.043 --> 01:14:55.293
Give him a kiss, Angela.

01:15:04.001 --> 01:15:07.084
One last thing, Mindhorn.

01:15:07.251 --> 01:15:11.293
Tell me the truth about Richard Thorncroft.

01:15:12.709 --> 01:15:14.793
Who is he?

01:15:16.834 --> 01:15:19.834
Let's just say, he's someone I used to know.

01:15:19.959 --> 01:15:21.834
Right, that's...

01:15:31.543 --> 01:15:33.793
You poor deluded fool.

01:15:35.418 --> 01:15:38.084
I am Richard Thorncroft.

01:15:50.251 --> 01:15:52.959
At least he didn't die in vain.

01:15:55.126 --> 01:15:56.793
What the hell is this?

01:15:59.834 --> 01:16:01.918
Yep, it's Plasticine.

01:16:03.209 --> 01:16:06.209
Yep, it's a Plasticine copy.

01:16:06.334 --> 01:16:09.376
Ha-ha! It's Plasticine!

01:16:20.793 --> 01:16:23.043
- Pat!
- Quick.

01:16:46.126 --> 01:16:48.668
'It's time for the apocalypse of justice.'

01:17:01.084 --> 01:17:02.709
Baines, don't shoot.

01:17:04.334 --> 01:17:08.543
We've got the tape. Richard has it.
It's safe. I'll take you to him.

01:17:08.626 --> 01:17:12.293
Maybe we can strike a deal. I don't want
to see the mayor go down any more...

01:17:12.459 --> 01:17:15.209
Jesus, Pat! Is that the best you can do?

01:17:15.334 --> 01:17:18.668
- I thought you were a good actress.
- She's good enough.

01:17:19.334 --> 01:17:21.001
Lose the piece.

01:17:24.376 --> 01:17:26.293
Turn around, slowly.

01:17:27.543 --> 01:17:29.251
Hands in the air.

01:17:30.959 --> 01:17:32.793
Now who's holding all the aces?

01:17:32.918 --> 01:17:34.709
- Aargh!
- Me, I think.

01:17:34.834 --> 01:17:38.459
- Richard, you bloody idiot!
- I didn't know she was going to do that.

01:17:40.543 --> 01:17:42.793
No! Patricia!

01:17:44.209 --> 01:17:45.751
Patricia, Patricia.

01:17:45.876 --> 01:17:47.334
Richard.

01:17:47.459 --> 01:17:50.293
- I'm so sorry.
- No, I'm sorry.

01:17:51.043 --> 01:17:54.626
- I never knew you wrote me those letters.
- Shh, that doesn't matter now.

01:17:54.709 --> 01:17:57.668
- Clive hid them from me.
- What a wanker.

01:17:58.793 --> 01:18:00.834
I'm sorry that I never believed you.

01:18:00.959 --> 01:18:02.751
And I'm sorry.

01:18:04.376 --> 01:18:06.918
I love you, Richard.

01:18:13.584 --> 01:18:16.668
Fucking hell. Where's the tape, Richard?

01:18:18.793 --> 01:18:20.501
There is no tape.

01:18:21.126 --> 01:18:24.668
It's fake, like everything else in my life!

01:18:25.709 --> 01:18:28.209
Without her, I may as well be dead.

01:18:29.709 --> 01:18:31.876
That was just a figure of speech.

01:18:34.709 --> 01:18:35.959
Why?

01:18:37.209 --> 01:18:39.001
Why?

01:18:40.584 --> 01:18:44.543
The Mayor's my uncle,
so I've got to clean up his mess.

01:18:44.668 --> 01:18:46.543
Family's family.

01:18:47.876 --> 01:18:50.459
- My family runs Man.
- Call an ambulance.

01:18:51.418 --> 01:18:53.709
It's not too late. I can forget.

01:18:53.793 --> 01:18:57.084
- What, that I killed Moncrief?
- Yeah, that.

01:19:00.793 --> 01:19:03.084
I can pretend I don't know that.

01:19:03.209 --> 01:19:06.376
- I can pretend!
- You're not that good an actor.

01:19:13.543 --> 01:19:16.334
Baines, are you all right?

01:19:16.459 --> 01:19:18.251
He shot Pat.

01:19:19.126 --> 01:19:23.251
He killed her and
then he tried to kill me and I...

01:19:23.376 --> 01:19:27.126
I had to take him down.
I had to take him down!

01:19:30.959 --> 01:19:32.501
- Baines.
- Chief.

01:19:32.626 --> 01:19:34.834
There was nothing I could do, it was, er...

01:19:34.959 --> 01:19:36.959
There was nothing I could do.

01:19:40.418 --> 01:19:42.043
Nice working with you again.

01:19:42.918 --> 01:19:45.376
What's going on, Thorncroft?

01:19:45.543 --> 01:19:47.876
'The Mayor's my uncle,
so I've got to clean up his mess.'

01:19:47.959 --> 01:19:49.209
'I can forget.'

01:19:49.334 --> 01:19:52.418
'What, that I killed Moncrief?
You're not that good an actor.'

01:19:52.543 --> 01:19:54.543
Aren't I?

01:19:56.626 --> 01:19:57.751
Mum!

01:19:57.876 --> 01:19:59.543
- Jasmine!
- Not cool.

01:19:59.668 --> 01:20:02.959
- Both sets of keys, give them to me.
- Think about what you're doing, Baines.

01:20:03.084 --> 01:20:04.876
Keys now or I'll blow her away.

01:20:05.001 --> 01:20:07.751
Get your filthy hands off my daughter!

01:20:09.126 --> 01:20:12.876
She's not your daughter,
she's Windjammer's daughter.

01:20:14.293 --> 01:20:17.834
- Clive, do something.
- I'm not wearing appropriate footwear.

01:20:17.959 --> 01:20:21.334
Stand down, Clive.
It's time I did my own stunts.

01:20:28.793 --> 01:20:30.668
It's Ginga time.

01:20:46.001 --> 01:20:50.126
This is the Ginga.

01:21:01.084 --> 01:21:05.501
I'm moving between the air.

01:21:12.709 --> 01:21:14.459
I'm here.

01:21:16.876 --> 01:21:20.334
I'm the bringer of the Ginga.

01:21:23.334 --> 01:21:25.418
And that's Capoeira.

01:21:29.251 --> 01:21:30.584
Jas.

01:21:32.626 --> 01:21:34.251
Ah, the Mayor was her uncle.

01:21:34.376 --> 01:21:37.834
Seems I was right
about the limited gene pool.

01:21:38.001 --> 01:21:40.543
I'm sorry that I rode you so hard back then.

01:21:40.668 --> 01:21:43.084
I hope we can put our differences behind us.

01:21:43.293 --> 01:21:45.959
I will if you will, and if it helps at all,

01:21:46.084 --> 01:21:49.709
I was pretty wasted, I don't even
remember that night with your wife.

01:21:49.793 --> 01:21:52.751
- What night with my wife?
- That's the spirit.

01:21:53.751 --> 01:21:57.751
My God, Richard. That was so brave.
It's a miracle you weren't shot.

01:21:57.876 --> 01:22:00.209
Ah, no more lies. I have to be honest.

01:22:00.293 --> 01:22:02.751
The truth is, I knew
there were blanks in that gun.

01:22:02.876 --> 01:22:06.293
No, no, this was Baines' gun.
That was live ammunition.

01:22:09.834 --> 01:22:11.209
Richard?

01:22:12.543 --> 01:22:13.918
I've got you.

01:22:14.626 --> 01:22:16.418
You got me all right.

01:22:17.626 --> 01:22:20.084
And that is the truth.

01:24:44.293 --> 01:24:46.584
# We had some fun together

01:24:46.709 --> 01:24:48.334
# But I never

01:24:48.459 --> 01:24:51.293
# I never promised you forever

01:24:52.376 --> 01:24:54.418
# No, no, no

01:24:54.543 --> 01:24:58.376
# You can't handcuff the wind

01:24:58.459 --> 01:25:01.709
# And if you try, you're gonna fail

01:25:03.001 --> 01:25:06.251
# It's like trying to put thunder in jail

01:25:06.418 --> 01:25:09.959
# You can't handcuff the wind

01:25:10.709 --> 01:25:13.793
# And if you try, you're gonna fail

01:25:15.126 --> 01:25:18.584
# It's like trying to put thunder in jail

01:25:18.709 --> 01:25:20.209
# You can't handcuff the wind

01:25:20.293 --> 01:25:23.001
# I feel the pull of the open road

01:25:23.126 --> 01:25:25.959
# I'm heading out into the night

01:25:26.126 --> 01:25:28.709
# You got to loosen up your grip, girl

01:25:28.834 --> 01:25:32.084
# You're holding on a little too tight

01:25:32.251 --> 01:25:34.751
# We rolled the dice, we played the game

01:25:34.834 --> 01:25:37.959
# Now every card's been turned

01:25:38.084 --> 01:25:40.959
# Girl, if you're trying to hold onto fire

01:25:41.084 --> 01:25:46.376
- # You're gonna get burnt
- # You can't handcuff the wind

01:25:46.501 --> 01:25:49.584
# And if you try, you're gonna fail

01:25:51.251 --> 01:25:54.543
# It's like trying to put thunder in jail

01:25:54.668 --> 01:25:56.209
# You can't handcuff the wind

01:25:56.376 --> 01:25:58.459
# And if you're trying to fence me in

01:25:58.584 --> 01:26:02.918
# I'll break down those fences
and run like a stallion in the night

01:26:03.001 --> 01:26:06.293
# I'm gonna burn so bright
like a white-hot flame

01:26:06.418 --> 01:26:09.251
# Till everybody knows my name

01:26:20.001 --> 01:26:22.751
# The open road, she calls my name

01:26:22.834 --> 01:26:26.209
# This itching in my feet

01:26:26.334 --> 01:26:28.626
# I got an engine that you can't tame

01:26:28.709 --> 01:26:30.876
# Even with your mouth so sweet

01:26:32.418 --> 01:26:34.376
# A thousand kisses and sad goodbyes

01:26:34.501 --> 01:26:37.709
# But it's too late for any more

01:26:37.834 --> 01:26:40.543
# The ferry to the mainland leaves at six

01:26:40.668 --> 01:26:45.584
- # I got to be there 20 minutes before
- # You can't handcuff the wind

01:26:46.584 --> 01:26:49.543
# And if you try, you're gonna fail

01:26:51.209 --> 01:26:54.418
# It's like trying to put thunder in jail

01:26:54.543 --> 01:26:57.209
# You can't handcuff the wind... #
