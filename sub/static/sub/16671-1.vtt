00:11.560 --> 00:13.927
Ash: Thirty years ago,
I found the Book of the Dead.

00:14.720 --> 00:16.768
Now, because I read
from the book...

00:16.920 --> 00:18.365
Misartra.

00:18.520 --> 00:20.363
...evil has found me.

00:20.520 --> 00:22.045
- (screams)
- (chainsaw revving)

00:22.200 --> 00:24.441
Ash:
All roads to destroying this evil

00:24.600 --> 00:27.444
lead to where it all began...
the cabin.

00:27.600 --> 00:29.967
- Let's go back there and end it all.
- You know I'm down.

00:30.120 --> 00:32.122
The sooner this book
is six feet under, the better.

00:32.280 --> 00:33.361
(yells)

00:34.920 --> 00:38.288
Here's the plan--
shoot first, think never.

00:39.440 --> 00:40.566
Whoa.

00:43.640 --> 00:44.641
That didn't work.

00:44.800 --> 00:46.723
Present the book to me,
and we'll finally end this.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.962
(speaks foreign language)

00:49.120 --> 00:50.724
- Pablo!
- (groans)

00:50.880 --> 00:53.850
- You have no idea what you're doing!
- Of course I know what I'm doing...

00:54.000 --> 00:55.490
I wrote this book.

00:58.160 --> 01:01.323
Your stupid mortal toys
mean nothing to me.

01:01.480 --> 01:04.211
Take the deal and go back to Jacksonville.

01:04.360 --> 01:07.807
I am offering you
the undo button you wanted.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.482
Normal life, in Jacksonville,
the three of us?

01:11.640 --> 01:13.210
- I can do that.
- Truce.

01:13.360 --> 01:16.967
- (music playing on radio)
- Yeah. (laughing)

01:18.160 --> 01:19.321
Whoo!

01:20.440 --> 01:22.966
Jacksonville, here we come.

01:33.040 --> 01:34.451
(growling)

01:43.360 --> 01:45.362
(roars)

01:54.320 --> 01:55.845
(distorted)
Mama.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.129
(speaking foreign language)

02:18.400 --> 02:21.210
(speaking foreign language)

02:37.400 --> 02:40.131
I have fought with Attila the Hun
and Genghis Khan...

02:42.360 --> 02:44.249
and this type shit
is my only hope?

02:44.400 --> 02:46.607
Oh, fuck.
What a mess.

02:47.560 --> 02:49.562
(groaning)

02:54.080 --> 02:55.969
(speaking foreign language)

03:14.120 --> 03:15.326
(screaming)

03:15.480 --> 03:17.084
(yells)

03:18.640 --> 03:20.608
- (cheering)
- (music playing)

03:24.120 --> 03:27.647
- Jacksonville, I love you!
- All: We love you, too!

03:27.800 --> 03:30.565
I know you do.
Hey, I love me, too.

03:32.640 --> 03:34.881
(chanting "Ash")

03:44.800 --> 03:46.325
Ah, Jefe.

03:46.480 --> 03:48.960
You know, you don't have to
call him that anymore, Pablo.

03:49.160 --> 03:52.482
'Cause now, he's just water trash,
like everyone else in this town.

03:52.640 --> 03:54.802
Especially non-tippers
like you, buddy.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.401
- Yeah, thanks.
- Hey, come on, Kel.

03:57.560 --> 04:00.040
Ash did what he had to do.
He saved us.

04:00.200 --> 04:02.168
And left Ruby in charge.
You know what?

04:02.320 --> 04:04.209
I don't trust that bitch
as far as I can throw her.

04:04.360 --> 04:06.931
Kelly, there's someone wanting to pay.

04:08.720 --> 04:10.210
Pull.

04:17.360 --> 04:18.690
Looking good, Eli.
(clicks tongue)

04:18.839 --> 04:21.446
Hey, sailor.

04:22.640 --> 04:25.530
- I had fun last night.
- I think I remember that.

04:26.600 --> 04:29.524
- This is my daughter Hannah.
- Oh, how nice for you to meet me.

04:30.760 --> 04:32.649
Can I, um, touch it?

04:36.800 --> 04:38.689
My God...

04:38.880 --> 04:40.882
How does it work?

04:41.040 --> 04:44.442
Uh, well, I think it's pretty obvious.

04:44.600 --> 04:46.762
Ladies, I'm gonna be
honest with you,

04:46.920 --> 04:50.163
I'm not drunk enough to know
if this is good weird or bad weird.

04:50.320 --> 04:52.846
- But I'll get there, though.
- (laughs)

05:04.720 --> 05:05.846
F...

05:06.720 --> 05:09.200
- Whoa.
- (clamoring)

05:09.360 --> 05:11.283
(thunder rumbling)

05:18.120 --> 05:19.690
Oh, shit!

05:27.600 --> 05:29.489
My God...

05:29.680 --> 05:32.126
I left the windows down
in the Delta.

05:32.280 --> 05:33.805
- (roars)
- Whoa!

05:33.960 --> 05:36.042
(screaming)

05:37.480 --> 05:39.801
Hey, hey, timeout.
You're not supposed to be here.

05:41.440 --> 05:43.169
Ash!
(grunts)

05:44.920 --> 05:46.763
Didn't you get the memo?
There's a truce!

05:46.920 --> 05:50.163
(distorted)
Talk to Ruby, she sent us.

05:51.400 --> 05:53.209
- Ah!
- Balls to the wall!

05:55.800 --> 05:57.484
(grunts)

06:00.080 --> 06:03.641
(distorted)
Your truce is over, Ashy Slashy.

06:04.920 --> 06:06.126
What did you call me?

06:06.280 --> 06:09.966
Ashy Slashy hatchet and saw,

06:10.120 --> 06:13.806
takes your head
and skins you raw.

06:13.960 --> 06:17.328
Ashy Slashy heaven and hell,

06:17.520 --> 06:21.764
cuts out your tongue
so you can't yell!

06:28.600 --> 06:30.523
What the fuck is this?!

06:30.680 --> 06:32.205
Shoot it in the head!

06:33.840 --> 06:36.411
_ (Scream-
<i>'</i> No! mg)

06:58.200 --> 07:00.931
Jefe! Your blade!

07:22.280 --> 07:24.089
- Give me your eyes!
- (screaming)

07:25.360 --> 07:27.488
Don't you wanna fuck me now?

07:34.000 --> 07:35.490
Ah...

07:42.800 --> 07:44.325
Get off me!

07:47.400 --> 07:48.686
I think we're good, Kel.

07:51.560 --> 07:53.801
Fucking skank.

08:24.160 --> 08:26.083
(distorted laughter)

08:27.600 --> 08:30.206
You will die like all the others.

08:30.400 --> 08:33.085
One by one, we will take you.
All of you!

08:33.280 --> 08:35.248
(laughing)

08:37.159 --> 08:38.160
Ladies first.

08:40.799 --> 08:42.529
(music playing)

08:45.720 --> 08:49.281
Well, I guess it's safe to say
the truce is over.

08:49.440 --> 08:50.965
Told you Ruby couldn't be trusted.

08:51.120 --> 08:53.600
We gotta put our little thinking caps on
and do something.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.609
Yes! You know I'm in.

08:55.800 --> 08:57.802
I have been waiting to kick her ass.

08:57.960 --> 08:59.405
Yeah, amen to that.

08:59.600 --> 09:02.046
But how?
Ruby could be anywhere.

09:05.160 --> 09:07.322
I know where she is.

09:07.520 --> 09:10.490
Ruby is in Elk Grove, Michigan.

09:10.640 --> 09:13.769
- That's my hometown.
- Okay, that's a very specific guess.

09:13.920 --> 09:16.730
The Deadite gave it away
with that song.

09:16.880 --> 09:19.804
That damn song.

09:19.960 --> 09:22.964
All right,
we're gonna go to Elk Grove,

09:23.160 --> 09:24.525
we're gonna find Ruby,

09:24.680 --> 09:26.250
and I'm gonna bury
that Kandarian Dagger

09:26.400 --> 09:29.529
deep into her strangely beautiful neck
and kill her where she stands.

09:29.680 --> 09:31.569
We'll be back
in Jacksonville by Friday.

09:31.720 --> 09:34.007
Pablo, first round
of 'ritas is on you,

09:34.160 --> 09:36.003
- because...
- Oh!

09:36.160 --> 09:37.969
Because it's the drink
of my people.

09:38.120 --> 09:40.964
That's a little racist, don't you think?
(chuckles)

09:41.120 --> 09:43.202
Well, yeah.

10:22.880 --> 10:25.042

You think Ruby's here?
In a crack house?

11:11.600 --> 11:14.683
No... this is my house.

11:15.640 --> 11:17.927
Or at least it used to be.

Oh...

it's-- it's... nice.

seems to really haunt him.

11:41.280 --> 11:44.568

- Where?

11:48.960 --> 11:50.928
He was right...
Dude, he was right there.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.809

12:39.400 --> 12:42.210
- Think I won't fight back?
- I'm not robbing you.

12:45.240 --> 12:47.561
- Ashley?
- Hello, Dad.

12:48.960 --> 12:51.691
Been a long time.

12:51.840 --> 12:54.650
You look, uh...

12:54.800 --> 12:56.484
old.

12:56.640 --> 12:59.246
- Bloated like a sack of...
- Yeah, I get the idea.

12:59.400 --> 13:01.641
- How you been, Pop?
- What do you want?

13:01.840 --> 13:04.491
Nothing. Can't a guy
come and see his own father?

13:06.600 --> 13:10.605
- What the hell is that?
- Oh, it's, um, an utility hand.

13:10.760 --> 13:12.728
A friend made it for me.
Check it out.

13:12.880 --> 13:14.689
- I'm better, stronger.
- Faster?

13:14.840 --> 13:16.001
- Yeah.
- Bullshit.

13:16.160 --> 13:17.889
Looks like some piece of crap
made in China.

13:18.040 --> 13:20.407
- Kelly: What was that gunshot?
- All right, put the guns down.

13:20.560 --> 13:23.040
- What is going on?
- You got a green card, kid?

13:23.200 --> 13:25.851
Kelly, Pablo, meet my father.

13:26.880 --> 13:28.723
Whoa, filthy and fine.

13:28.880 --> 13:32.009
Brock Williams,
but you can call me "Cock."

13:32.200 --> 13:34.771
- He's your father all right.
- Um...

13:34.920 --> 13:36.729
thought you said
your dad was dead.

13:36.880 --> 13:39.247
Dead?
He's the one that died, not me.

13:39.400 --> 13:41.880
Uh, we were sort of
dead to each other.

13:42.040 --> 13:43.804
- What have you done now?
- Nothing.

13:43.960 --> 13:45.405
We're just looking for someone.
Pablo.

13:45.560 --> 13:49.281
I drew most of it
while the car was moving, but...

13:51.440 --> 13:54.603
- You're looking for Bigfoot?
- It was a bumpy ride.

13:54.760 --> 13:56.967
Okay, you know what, forget it.
You don't wanna help, that's fine.

13:57.120 --> 14:00.249
- Some things never change.
- Still the victim with you, huh?

14:00.440 --> 14:01.885
Always somebody else's fault.

14:02.040 --> 14:03.929
Somebody else made you
go to that cabin.

14:04.080 --> 14:06.481
- Somebody else chopped your hand off.
- Uh, no, I did that.

14:06.640 --> 14:08.927
- Somebody else killed your girl.
- No, I did that, too.

14:09.080 --> 14:11.321
Come on, Dad.
You know exactly what happened.

14:11.480 --> 14:12.970
Why didn't you
set those people straight?

14:13.160 --> 14:14.446
Because you should have.

14:14.600 --> 14:15.931
Instead, you let 'em
beat you down

14:16.120 --> 14:18.487
and you ran away
with your tail between your legs.

14:18.640 --> 14:20.290
Thank God your mother
wasn't here to see that.

14:20.440 --> 14:22.044
I did what I had to do.

14:23.360 --> 14:27.285
Ashley, it's taken me a long time
to get my life back together.

14:28.200 --> 14:32.808
I think it's best that
you and the illegal here just leave.

14:32.960 --> 14:35.122
Kelly, would you like
to have dinner with me?

14:35.280 --> 14:37.009
That's a hard pass.

14:38.640 --> 14:40.563
Get out.

14:42.720 --> 14:45.929
(sighs)
Let's go.

14:49.520 --> 14:51.090
Man on radio:
Oh, blitz on McNabb.

14:51.280 --> 14:52.725
Somehow he...

15:12.160 --> 15:15.164
Elk Grove... hasn't changed a bit.

15:15.320 --> 15:18.130
- What's the plan?
- We split up, ask around.

15:18.280 --> 15:20.647
YOu!

15:23.120 --> 15:26.203
You ruined my life.

15:26.400 --> 15:29.210
- I've ruined a lot of people's lives.
- Here, man, I got some change.

15:36.720 --> 15:39.644
(stammers)

15:40.840 --> 15:42.524
How do--.

15:42.680 --> 15:44.125
Thanks.

15:45.400 --> 15:46.890
Okay, let's go.

15:47.040 --> 15:48.565
Jacksonville's waiting.

15:57.120 --> 15:59.009

16:04.320 --> 16:06.049

16:06.200 --> 16:08.567
Man: It's him.
Woman: No way.

16:09.440 --> 16:11.044
Woman: Ash?

16:11.240 --> 16:13.891
Ash Williams, is that you?

16:14.040 --> 16:15.530
Linda Bates!

16:15.680 --> 16:18.251
Holy hell! Wow.

16:18.400 --> 16:20.129
It's been so long.

16:20.280 --> 16:22.123
You look great
in that waitress getup.

16:22.280 --> 16:24.931
- Probably even better out of it.
- Ooh, same Ash.

16:25.080 --> 16:27.765
- All okay here?
- Yeah.

16:27.960 --> 16:31.760
- Little Tommy Emery?
- It's Sheriff Emery now.

16:31.920 --> 16:34.446
And I'm all grown up.
You can ask around.

16:34.600 --> 16:36.284
Oh...

16:37.160 --> 16:38.924
Oh, you--

16:39.080 --> 16:41.970
- No, you married safety boy?
- Who?

16:42.120 --> 16:44.122
That's what we called him
back when he was a hall monitor.

16:44.280 --> 16:46.408
Remember the time you peed your pants
outside the locker room?

16:46.560 --> 16:48.403
- 'Cause you were leaning on the door.
- Guilty.

16:48.560 --> 16:50.927
Hey, that was such a long time ago.

16:51.080 --> 16:52.889
- Right, honey?
- No.

16:53.040 --> 16:55.884
- Can you give us a second?
- Sure.

16:57.040 --> 16:59.486
- Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.
- Hey.

16:59.640 --> 17:01.881
- Mmm.
- Hey!

17:02.080 --> 17:04.765
You got some huge balls
showing your face in this town.

17:04.960 --> 17:06.484
Yeah, I do.

17:06.640 --> 17:08.085
Notice I never wore gym shorts?

17:08.240 --> 17:10.402
I'm here on business--
looking for a woman.

17:10.560 --> 17:11.607
She's bad news.

17:11.800 --> 17:14.280
If I don't find her, you might actually
have something to do around here.

17:14.440 --> 17:16.282
Well, then, let's find her for you.

17:16.440 --> 17:18.646
Everyone!

17:18.800 --> 17:20.801
This is Ash.

17:20.960 --> 17:23.281
Some of you may know him
as Ashy Slashy,

17:23.440 --> 17:25.807
because he went crazy
and chopped up his friends.

17:25.960 --> 17:27.484
Okay, that's not true.

17:27.640 --> 17:29.005
I did not go crazy.

17:29.160 --> 17:32.448
I knew exactly what I was doing
when I chopped up my friends.

17:32.600 --> 17:36.491
And now,
Ashy Slashy is back in town

17:36.640 --> 17:38.165
looking for a new woman.

17:38.320 --> 17:40.322
So, what do people think?

17:40.480 --> 17:43.165
Should we help Ash
find another victim?

17:43.320 --> 17:46.324
Or should we kick him back
to whatever rock he was hiding under?

17:46.480 --> 17:48.164
Fuck this sicko.
He's gotta go.

17:48.320 --> 17:49.481
- Man: Yeah! Get him out!
- (crowd jeering)

17:49.640 --> 17:52.803
(chanting "Ashy Slashy")

18:01.440 --> 18:03.124
No.

18:03.280 --> 18:05.601
No more running away.

18:07.640 --> 18:09.802
All right, get the gum
out of your ears and listen up,

18:09.960 --> 18:12.167
you inbred,
degenerate screwheads.

18:12.360 --> 18:15.045
Except you, Linda.
You're so not like them.

18:15.200 --> 18:19.489
Yes, I am "Ashy Slashy."

18:19.640 --> 18:21.881
The boomstick butcher
with the chainsaw hand,

18:22.040 --> 18:24.202
but you nimrods got me all wrong.

18:24.360 --> 18:26.089
I'm here to save this town--

18:26.240 --> 18:28.322
to save my town
whether you like it or not.

18:28.480 --> 18:30.482
Now, I'm here looking
for somebody.

18:34.600 --> 18:37.046
Check it out.
She goes by the name of Ruby.

18:37.200 --> 18:38.725
anybody?

18:38.880 --> 18:40.928
You use your chainsaw
to draw that?

18:41.080 --> 18:43.208
(laughter)

18:43.360 --> 18:45.044
Time to leave, Ash.

18:45.200 --> 18:47.328
Oh, I'm gonna leave, all right.

18:47.520 --> 18:48.726
And don't you worry.

18:48.880 --> 18:50.882
After I save all your sorry asses,

18:51.040 --> 18:54.681
you won't see me again
for another 30 years, dicksticks!

18:54.840 --> 18:57.366
- Man: Loser!
- (jeering, laughter)

19:06.240 --> 19:08.242
(cat screeching)

19:12.960 --> 19:14.769
(gasps)

19:50.160 --> 19:51.650
Oh!

19:54.720 --> 19:57.087
No!
(Screaming)

20:05.440 --> 20:08.125
Hey!Hey!
Takeiteasy!

20:09.640 --> 20:11.722
- Ash: Pablo.
- What's wrong?

20:12.840 --> 20:15.002
I just saw Ruby!

20:15.160 --> 20:16.969
- Saw Ruby? Where?
- I don't know.

20:17.120 --> 20:19.088
I just had a weird vision of her

20:19.240 --> 20:21.971
in front of a big,
brick building.

20:22.120 --> 20:24.805
There were, uh,
these smoke stacks there.

20:24.960 --> 20:27.042
- Two big smoke stacks?
- Yeah.

20:28.440 --> 20:30.329
That sounds like
the crematorium.

20:30.800 --> 20:32.848
(organ playing)

20:37.560 --> 20:39.528
This is it.

20:40.440 --> 20:42.010
I saw it so clearly.

20:42.160 --> 20:45.004
Pablo, how long you been
having these visions?

20:45.160 --> 20:47.003
Ever since Ruby
put that book on my face,

20:47.160 --> 20:50.323
I've been having nightmares,
but they happen while I'm awake.

20:50.480 --> 20:53.609
- How come you never said something?
- I was afraid.

20:54.800 --> 20:56.848
I don't know
what's happening to me, Jefe.

20:57.840 --> 21:00.002
Let's go get some answers.

21:00.160 --> 21:02.401
(music playing)

21:18.960 --> 21:21.008
We gave peace a chance...

21:21.160 --> 21:23.162
now it's time for war.

21:38.680 --> 21:40.125
(low groan)

21:43.080 --> 21:45.560
All right, you two, go that way.

21:45.720 --> 21:47.768
But remember, these weapons
are only gonna stun Ruby,

21:47.920 --> 21:49.524
so use them to
knock her down or whatever.

21:49.680 --> 21:51.887
Then before she heals,

21:52.080 --> 21:54.367
I'm gonna put an end to this
horse pucky once and for all.

22:03.240 --> 22:05.766
(grunts)
Oh, God. Damn.

22:05.920 --> 22:07.843
(low groaning)

23:00.360 --> 23:02.931
Ruby! I know you're out there!

23:14.440 --> 23:15.885
Hey!

23:17.080 --> 23:19.401
Creepy kid?
You grew up quick.

23:19.560 --> 23:21.164
(distorted) You should not have
come back, Ashley.

23:21.320 --> 23:23.084
(screams)

23:24.960 --> 23:26.803
(laughing)

23:34.080 --> 23:35.206
Ash?

23:36.200 --> 23:37.690
- Ash?
- It's that way.

23:37.840 --> 23:39.649
'(Yelling
<i>'</i> Kelly! )

23:39.800 --> 23:42.167
Kelly!

23:42.320 --> 23:43.401
Kel!

23:47.160 --> 23:48.924
(gasping)

24:01.440 --> 24:03.010
Kelly?

24:29.360 --> 24:32.091
Yeah, that's it!

24:32.280 --> 24:34.282
Run home and cry to mama!

24:34.440 --> 24:37.250
You tell her Ashley J. Williams
is looking for her!

24:37.400 --> 24:39.323
(grunts)

24:40.520 --> 24:41.760
Oh!

24:43.000 --> 24:44.684
Why you...

24:47.280 --> 24:49.362
(coughs)

24:49.520 --> 24:51.443
My goodness...

24:54.480 --> 24:56.164
(whispering)

25:03.920 --> 25:06.491
(whispering)

25:18.760 --> 25:20.728
(distant screech)

25:47.960 --> 25:49.769
Kelly...

25:49.920 --> 25:52.161
you're stronger than Ash.

25:52.360 --> 25:54.362
Why do you follow

25:54.520 --> 25:56.761
when you should lead?

26:03.280 --> 26:04.520
Join us.

26:50.520 --> 26:53.524
Help! Help!

26:53.680 --> 26:55.364
Ash!

26:58.360 --> 27:00.601

27:06.040 --> 27:08.122
(voice whispers, echoes "Ash")

27:20.560 --> 27:22.403
- Ash.
- Ah!

27:22.560 --> 27:24.722
Oh, you actually found me.

27:24.880 --> 27:27.884
Don't be so surprised, you know,
I do have my moments...

27:28.080 --> 27:29.730
- like this one.
- Hey.

27:29.880 --> 27:31.928
You broke our truce, why?

27:32.080 --> 27:35.084
I had no option.
I had to summon you.

27:35.240 --> 27:37.322
What, so you can sic
your creepy ass kids on me?

27:37.480 --> 27:38.481
No.

27:38.640 --> 27:41.610
My children have turned on me.
I've lost control of them.

27:41.800 --> 27:43.962
They want the Necronomicon.
They're trying to destroy me.

27:44.120 --> 27:45.804
(sarcastic crying)
Poor Ruby.

27:45.960 --> 27:48.122
Yeah, welcome to my world,
sweet cheeks.

27:48.280 --> 27:49.770
Doesn't feel so good, does it?

27:49.920 --> 27:51.922
At least you still have
all your appendages!

27:52.080 --> 27:54.890
Now, Ash, I need your help.

27:55.040 --> 27:57.646
Oh... oh, you need my help?

27:57.800 --> 28:00.929
Okay, first of all,
screw you and your ugly ass kids.

28:01.080 --> 28:03.606
Here's what I need--
I need to be back in Jacksonville

28:03.760 --> 28:06.286
on my second keg of beer,
putting my spicy man meat

28:06.440 --> 28:09.091
into a mother-daughter sandwich,
that's what I need.

28:09.240 --> 28:13.086
As unappetizing as that sounds,
you can still have all of that.

28:13.240 --> 28:15.163
Just trust me.

28:15.320 --> 28:16.481
- Help me stop my children--
- (growls)

28:16.640 --> 28:18.642
- (screams)
- Hey!

28:18.840 --> 28:21.571
I wasn't done with her!

28:22.560 --> 28:24.005
Help!

28:25.200 --> 28:28.602
Help! Pablo, help!

28:28.760 --> 28:30.762
(gasps)

28:38.040 --> 28:40.042
- (coughing)
- (grunts)

28:51.600 --> 28:54.126
(distorted)
Mama.

28:59.720 --> 29:02.200
Three creepy kids.

29:02.360 --> 29:06.251
Well, Ruby's a big girl.
I'm sure she can handle herself.

29:17.480 --> 29:20.324
- (screams)
- Where is the Necronomicon?

29:20.480 --> 29:23.723
- What have you done with it?
- I'll never tell you.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.287
(groans)

29:30.880 --> 29:33.326
Oh, those damn radar eyes.

29:34.400 --> 29:37.961
Do I save her 'cause I should?
Or cause she's hot?

29:39.240 --> 29:41.242
(distorted)
Mama.

29:41.400 --> 29:43.880
(Ash whistles)

29:44.040 --> 29:45.565
All right, you naked assholes,

29:45.760 --> 29:48.047
time to pick on
someone your own size.

29:48.200 --> 29:49.645
(growls)

29:54.080 --> 29:56.082
(growls)

29:58.200 --> 30:00.407
(revs chainsaw)

30:00.560 --> 30:01.800
You want some?!

30:10.280 --> 30:11.884
You feel that? Huh?

30:12.080 --> 30:14.890
Do you? You feel that?
(laughs)

30:15.080 --> 30:16.491
Do you?

30:27.880 --> 30:31.521
(distorted) The Necronomicon
says you are humanity's true savior.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.970
This is where your story ends, Jefe!

30:37.560 --> 30:39.927
(shrieking)

30:46.080 --> 30:48.003
(grunting, gurgling)

30:52.240 --> 30:53.730
Spawn: Ma...

30:57.000 --> 30:58.490
I'm sorry.

31:07.040 --> 31:08.166
Sorry, creepy kid...

31:08.320 --> 31:09.970
playtime's over.

31:10.120 --> 31:11.201
Night-night.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.650
Told you you could trust me.

31:40.800 --> 31:42.962
- Jefe!
- Stay the fuck away from him!

31:43.120 --> 31:44.121
I got this.

31:45.440 --> 31:47.044
I've made a huge mess.

31:47.200 --> 31:50.329
Yeah, you really fudged the bowl
this time, didn't you?

31:50.480 --> 31:54.166
Now you want me to put the old rubber
gloves on and help you scrub it clean.

31:54.320 --> 31:56.288
Part of me is already
regretting calling you here.

31:56.440 --> 31:57.965
Get used to that feeling.
Where's the book?

31:58.120 --> 31:59.167
- Hid it.
- Go get it.

31:59.320 --> 32:02.563
My children are too powerful
for me alone.

32:02.720 --> 32:05.371
Ash, I need you.

32:05.520 --> 32:09.650
All of you, help me retrieve the book
and send them back to hell.

32:09.800 --> 32:11.882
Give me a second.

32:12.040 --> 32:14.646
You guys good with that? Huh?

32:15.560 --> 32:17.483
Okay, we get the book,

32:17.640 --> 32:19.529
send your loser kids back to hell,

32:19.680 --> 32:21.523
we're back in Jacksonville by Friday.

32:21.680 --> 32:24.490
Pablo, first round of 'ritas
is on you, because...

32:24.640 --> 32:26.881
Uh, yeah,
you already used that one.

32:27.040 --> 32:28.371
- Really?
- Word-for-word.

32:28.520 --> 32:29.885
Wow.

32:30.040 --> 32:31.690
Maybe I'm getting that
bad memory disease.

32:31.880 --> 32:33.086
- Alzheimer's?
- Alzheimer's?!

32:33.240 --> 32:35.527
That's a bad memory disease.
Why would you mention that?

32:35.720 --> 32:38.166
Focus up, we got work to do.

32:39.720 --> 32:41.449
