00:23.156 --> 00:24.748
No one ever hired Turbo Man...

00:24.824 --> 00:27.315
for driving through
the front gate like a tourist.

00:27.394 --> 00:29.123
"Turbo Man"?

00:29.662 --> 00:32.631
Welcome to Circus Major.
Terrific.

00:32.698 --> 00:33.961
My friends call me Michael.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.594
She says you're going to give
Circus Major a real shot in the arm.

00:36.669 --> 00:39.832
Why do I get the feeling someone
doesn't want Turbo Man in your circus?

00:39.906 --> 00:43.865
Together they'll pass through
the ring of fire.

00:43.943 --> 00:48.812
If he's that interested in fires, maybe
you should give him one he won't forget.

00:49.182 --> 00:51.480
Incendiary bomb, Michael.
Jump.

01:05.498 --> 01:07.159
Knight Rider...

01:07.233 --> 01:10.634
a shadowy flight into the
dangerous world of a man...

01:10.703 --> 01:12.432
who does not exist.

01:20.480 --> 01:22.607
Michael Knight,
a young loner...

01:22.682 --> 01:25.116
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent...

01:25.185 --> 01:27.346
the helpless, the powerless...

01:27.420 --> 01:30.651
in a world of criminals
who operate above the law.

02:33.520 --> 02:36.387
All right. The circus,
the circus, the circus.

02:36.456 --> 02:38.788
You know, you can take the boy
out of the circus, KITT...

02:38.858 --> 02:41.088
but you can't take the circus
out of the boy.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.992
Michael, would you
kindly explain to me...

02:43.062 --> 02:44.461
what people find so amusing...

02:44.531 --> 02:48.433
about 20 grown men, wearing
red noses and baggy pants...

02:48.501 --> 02:50.901
climbing out of a car
the size of a baby carriage.

02:52.305 --> 02:55.069
Well, it's kind of like
a pie in the face.

02:55.141 --> 02:58.235
If you have to explain it,
it's just not funny.

02:58.344 --> 02:59.743
"A pie in the face?"

02:59.812 --> 03:01.837
Don't tell me that's
another form of circus humor.

03:01.915 --> 03:05.681
Absolutely not. Well, I'm
certainly glad of that.

03:05.752 --> 03:08.778
They use tomatoes,
eggs, ice cream.

04:00.473 --> 04:04.034
Oh, the magic
and wonder of it all, Bonnie.

04:04.110 --> 04:05.577
Did I ever tell you
about the time...

04:05.645 --> 04:10.014
You went undercover in occupied
France as Valentino the Knife Thrower.

04:10.383 --> 04:12.647
Well, well, well,
you remember.

04:12.719 --> 04:15.586
Yes, I spent three months
with Circus Major.

04:15.655 --> 04:19.557
As a matter of fact, my senior OSS
officer, may he rest in peace...

04:19.625 --> 04:23.494
was Gunther Major, whose
father founded this very show.

04:23.563 --> 04:26.964
Now, Gunther's two children
are the star attractions.

04:37.243 --> 04:39.768
And here comes
our star attraction.

04:44.751 --> 04:46.275
Yo, Devon.

04:46.352 --> 04:48.752
Michael, I am so glad you could
make it to the dress rehearsal.

04:48.821 --> 04:51.756
A herd of dancing elephants
couldn't keep me away.

04:51.824 --> 04:52.813
Hi, sweetie.

04:53.993 --> 04:56.791
KITT, would you tape the
Flying Majors for me, please?

04:56.863 --> 04:57.887
Of course, Devon.

04:57.964 --> 05:00.626
I'll even use
my new image-enhancement lens.

05:01.834 --> 05:03.233
Thank you, I appreciate it.

05:05.038 --> 05:09.236
And now, Circus Major
is proud to present...

05:09.309 --> 05:11.209
our star attraction.

05:11.944 --> 05:14.208
Ladies and gentlemen.

05:14.580 --> 05:17.640
The Flying Majors.

05:26.292 --> 05:28.954
Only a handful of fliers
have mastered the art...

05:29.028 --> 05:31.758
of the triple somersault,
and Peter Major's one of them.

05:31.831 --> 05:35.733
I think I'd feel a lot better
if they used a net. So would I.

05:35.935 --> 05:39.029
But I don't think
they'd sell as many tickets.

05:43.576 --> 05:45.635
Watch, she's about to fly.

06:07.433 --> 06:09.298
Hey, way to go.
Yeah.

06:10.036 --> 06:12.027
All right, Terry.
Nice going.

06:12.105 --> 06:14.665
All right, Terry.
Great, Terry, it's a good one.

06:14.741 --> 06:17.972
Now wait till you see Peter.
You think he'll try the triple?

06:18.044 --> 06:20.979
Yes, knowing his father as
well as I did, I'm sure of it.

06:21.047 --> 06:25.916
And now, ladies and gentlemen, Peter
Major will perform the very difficult...

06:26.285 --> 06:29.686
triple somersault
without a net.

06:30.490 --> 06:32.856
We request your silence...

06:33.459 --> 06:37.725
so he can
maintain his concentration.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.332
Ladies and gentlemen...

06:40.433 --> 06:45.063
the seldom performed
triple somersault.

06:53.813 --> 06:57.340
Is it my imagination, or does
he look a little unsteady?

07:02.422 --> 07:04.788
Well, no, I don't think so.

07:04.857 --> 07:07.348
No, I'm sure
it's part of the act.

07:34.821 --> 07:35.879
No!

07:37.356 --> 07:39.256
KITT, scan his vitals.

07:51.904 --> 07:55.465
Michael, I'm sorry.
He's dead. Oh, dear God.

08:04.150 --> 08:06.118
Devon, you're looking
at that tape for hours.

08:06.185 --> 08:07.743
You want to tell me
what you're looking for?

08:07.820 --> 08:09.287
I wish I knew.

08:09.355 --> 08:12.119
All I am certain of is that I
have a nagging feeling that...

08:12.191 --> 08:13.783
Peter's fall
was not an accident.

08:13.860 --> 08:15.555
Well, you lived
with the family.

08:15.628 --> 08:17.323
I don't think
anybody's more entitled.

08:17.396 --> 08:18.863
Look at this.

08:20.533 --> 08:23.934
He is putting rosin on his hands.
There's nothing unusual about that.

08:24.003 --> 08:24.992
No.

08:25.071 --> 08:28.734
But watch what he does just
before he catches the trapeze.

08:30.309 --> 08:31.503
He wipes his brow.

08:31.577 --> 08:32.908
Yes, with the
palm of his hand.

08:32.979 --> 08:35.708
Thereby rubbing off some,
if not all, of the rosin.

08:35.780 --> 08:39.511
Something a man whose life
depended on his grip wouldn't do.

08:40.686 --> 08:43.553
KITT, give me a close up of his
upper chest and head area, will you?

08:43.623 --> 08:45.386
Right away, Michael.

08:47.126 --> 08:49.458
He looks like
he's gasping for air.

08:49.529 --> 08:52.259
That's strange behavior for a
perfectly conditioned athlete.

08:52.331 --> 08:54.561
That still isn't
any proof of foul play.

08:54.634 --> 08:58.365
He might've suffered a brief seizure, of
some kind, or maybe even a heart attack.

08:58.437 --> 09:02.203
Or maybe he was drugged. Did the
authorities perform an autopsy?

09:02.275 --> 09:06.541
They're convinced his death was
accidental. They saw no reason for one.

09:06.612 --> 09:08.546
Do you think you can get them
to change their minds?

09:08.614 --> 09:11.947
I can certainly try. Yeah, well,
for Terry's sake, try real hard.

09:12.585 --> 09:14.075
I'll see you.

09:21.928 --> 09:23.793
Michael, if you're expecting
circus people...

09:23.863 --> 09:25.728
to bare their souls to you,
forget it.

09:25.798 --> 09:28.767
My research tells me that they're
an extremely close-knit group...

09:28.834 --> 09:33.203
who are about as open to strangers
as a convention of crime figures.

09:33.272 --> 09:36.673
Ah, but I'm not going in as a stranger.
I'm going in as one of their own.

09:36.742 --> 09:38.607
Good idea. How about...

09:38.678 --> 09:42.170
"The Magnificent Michael and
his Colossal Cotton Candy."

09:42.281 --> 09:44.476
A bit sticky, maybe, but safe.

09:44.550 --> 09:48.213
I was thinking of something
a little more flamboyant.

09:48.287 --> 09:50.983
What do you hope to gain
by going undercover anyway?

09:51.057 --> 09:53.890
KITT, the only people who were
around him before he fell...

09:53.960 --> 09:55.291
were his fellow performers.

09:55.361 --> 09:57.522
You think one of them might've
had something to do with it?

09:57.597 --> 09:59.087
I don't know.

09:59.165 --> 10:02.464
The only way I'm going to find out
is by being able to move among them.

10:02.535 --> 10:05.060
In the meantime, give me
everything you got on Circus Major.

10:05.137 --> 10:07.230
Hidden assets, hidden debts.

10:07.306 --> 10:08.830
Most of all...

10:08.908 --> 10:11.706
anyone who might have had
a grudge against Peter.

10:27.627 --> 10:30.460
Bombo, don't you... Don't
you dare. I am warning you.

10:30.529 --> 10:32.622
If you get
one drop of water on me...

10:32.698 --> 10:34.222
Water?

10:34.300 --> 10:38.760
I'm not in any mood for confetti,
either. Confetti? How about greens?

10:40.773 --> 10:44.573
Where'd all that come from?
The sky. It rained money.

10:45.578 --> 10:47.739
Now, come on, Bombo,
it hasn't rained in a month.

10:47.813 --> 10:49.303
Money or anything else.

10:49.382 --> 10:51.907
Okay, okay, okay.
Bang found it. Right, Bang?

10:54.253 --> 10:56.153
Bombo, I am warning you.

10:58.357 --> 11:00.951
Okay, Terry.
Sweetheart, it's a gift.

11:01.927 --> 11:05.124
It's from us. Your
friends who love you. Yeah.

11:05.431 --> 11:08.059
We admit it's not much,
but it's something.

11:09.068 --> 11:10.160
And what the heck...

11:10.236 --> 11:13.535
if it keeps this crazy circus
going one more day, right, gang...

11:13.606 --> 11:15.699
we can afford it, huh?
Sure. Right.

11:16.709 --> 11:18.074
Thank you.

11:19.378 --> 11:21.812
Thank you,
every last one of you.

11:21.881 --> 11:24.782
Ah, don't mention it, Terry. We
were glad to do it, huh, gang?

11:24.850 --> 11:25.839
You bet.

11:27.887 --> 11:30.287
But I'm afraid, it's going to
take a lot more than this...

11:30.356 --> 11:32.984
to keep Circus Major
from going under.

11:34.393 --> 11:37.624
What we need...
Well, we need another big act.

11:43.202 --> 11:44.191
All right, KITT...

11:44.270 --> 11:47.501
I think it's time we made our
big entrance on two wheels.

11:47.573 --> 11:51.009
Michael, you're not... But
the front gate's wide open.

11:51.077 --> 11:52.601
There's plenty of room.

11:52.678 --> 11:54.305
No one ever hired Turbo Man...

11:54.380 --> 11:57.178
for driving through
the front gate like a tourist.

11:57.249 --> 11:59.183
"Turbo Man"?

11:59.785 --> 12:02.253
Wow. How'd he do that?

12:02.988 --> 12:03.977
Two wheels?

12:06.058 --> 12:07.548
He's gonna hit the clown.

12:09.028 --> 12:10.017
Wow.

12:11.664 --> 12:13.063
Oh, my God.

12:20.139 --> 12:23.131
I've never seen anything
like it. You know what I mean?

12:37.456 --> 12:40.323
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

12:40.392 --> 12:42.121
For those of you who haven't
already heard of me...

12:42.194 --> 12:44.458
allow me introduce myself.

12:44.730 --> 12:47.756
I'm the world-renowned
Turbo Man...

12:48.601 --> 12:51.661
and this is
my flying carpet, KITT.

12:51.737 --> 12:53.432
Your "flying carpet"?

12:53.506 --> 12:54.973
Excuse me,
ladies and gentlemen...

12:55.040 --> 12:58.009
my talking flying carpet,
KITT.

12:58.077 --> 13:00.443
Who can also crash through
solid walls...

13:00.513 --> 13:03.209
jump fences in a single bound,
drive by itself...

13:03.282 --> 13:05.978
and imitate any sound
known to mankind.

13:06.552 --> 13:08.918
Give them an example,
O great KITT.

13:08.988 --> 13:11.889
Michael, really...
KITT.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.752
All right, you asked for it.

13:30.743 --> 13:33.837
Michael, will you kindly take
this poor man's King Kong...

13:33.913 --> 13:35.437
off my person?

13:38.417 --> 13:40.817
Well, don't say
I didn't warn you.

13:46.592 --> 13:51.120
Come on, Bang, let's go.
Bang? An orangutan named Bang?

13:53.199 --> 13:54.188
Let's go.

13:58.604 --> 14:01.038
Well, you certainly
have some act.

14:02.875 --> 14:05.241
Wait a minute, didn't I see
you at the dress rehearsal?

14:05.311 --> 14:08.872
Yes, as a matter of fact, you
did. I came by to audition.

14:09.315 --> 14:11.840
But under
the circumstances...

14:11.917 --> 14:13.714
I'm very sorry
about your brother.

14:14.486 --> 14:16.579
Yeah. Yeah, I am, too.

14:17.189 --> 14:18.713
But what's the saying?
You know...

14:18.791 --> 14:22.352
"Tears are as much a part of
the circus as the laughter."

14:22.828 --> 14:24.819
Well, maybe even more so.

14:26.765 --> 14:29.325
Look, I can't afford
to pay you much.

14:29.401 --> 14:31.631
Truth is, I don't even
know how much longer...

14:31.704 --> 14:33.103
I can keep this show going.

14:33.172 --> 14:35.367
Well, the truth is, if I did
this for just the money...

14:35.441 --> 14:36.738
I'd find another line of work.

14:36.809 --> 14:39.869
Oh, well, then you've come
to the right place, Turbo Man.

14:39.945 --> 14:42.607
Welcome to Circus Major.
Terrific.

14:42.681 --> 14:44.581
My friends call me Michael.

14:44.650 --> 14:48.086
Let's go sign the contract,
Michael. You got a deal.

14:52.458 --> 14:56.519
This is the last picture ever
taken of Peter during a performance.

14:58.097 --> 15:00.258
There'll never be
another flyer like him.

15:00.332 --> 15:02.357
Circus is really
in your blood, isn't it?

15:02.434 --> 15:04.925
It's in the blood
of this town.

15:05.204 --> 15:08.503
Majorville has been our
winter home for over 50 years.

15:09.141 --> 15:12.577
We help support the school, the
hospital, we give jobs to people...

15:12.645 --> 15:15.842
and even help take care
of them when they get old.

15:17.049 --> 15:19.040
Without this circus
in this town...

15:19.118 --> 15:22.144
we'd just dry up and blow
away. It's as simple as that.

15:22.221 --> 15:24.746
Well, we're not going
to let that happen, are we?

15:24.823 --> 15:27.121
I'll believe that
when I see it.

15:28.894 --> 15:31.920
So, ready to sign, Turbo Man?
With pleasure.

15:32.298 --> 15:34.528
On the dotted line, I presume.

15:36.368 --> 15:39.804
Do you smell something burning? Yes.

15:41.173 --> 15:42.936
KITT, we got a fire.

15:46.512 --> 15:49.072
Hurry! Jump in. Call out
the fire brigade, pal.

15:49.148 --> 15:50.809
Attention, circus crew...

15:50.883 --> 15:53.215
there's a fire
in the costume tent.

16:00.292 --> 16:01.418
All our costumes are in there.

16:01.493 --> 16:03.154
If they're destroyed,
we'll have to close down.

16:03.228 --> 16:05.162
Hit it with the C02,
will you, pal?

16:05.230 --> 16:06.219
Terry!

16:11.737 --> 16:12.931
Terry.

16:27.219 --> 16:30.313
All right, take some deep
breaths. She'll be okay.

16:33.726 --> 16:37.526
Oh, Michael, first my brother,
now this. Why?

16:38.097 --> 16:41.362
I don't know, Terry,
but I'm gonna to find out.

16:41.433 --> 16:43.867
Believe me,
I'm gonna to find out.

16:59.284 --> 17:03.414
Looks like this is the flash point,
KITT. Scan the ashes, will you?

17:05.790 --> 17:08.453
I'm picking up a high
concentration of phosphorescence...

17:08.527 --> 17:11.428
only a few feet
from where you're standing.

17:26.412 --> 17:28.607
See anything interesting
down there?

17:28.680 --> 17:31.672
Nothing that doesn't
get better on the way up.

17:32.451 --> 17:35.818
I'm Tiger.
Huh, you're kidding?

17:35.888 --> 17:38.857
And you must be Turbo Man.
The one with the magic car.

17:38.924 --> 17:40.482
Oh, yeah, well...

17:40.559 --> 17:44.825
He just sits there. I mean, I do
all the work. I heard that, Michael.

17:44.897 --> 17:47.491
And speaking of work,
don't we have some to do?

17:47.566 --> 17:48.624
Not now, KITT.

17:48.700 --> 17:50.361
Michael?
Not now.

17:51.003 --> 17:54.404
He's a workaholic. You know,
practice, practice, practice.

17:54.473 --> 17:57.840
I see, and you're the type who
enjoys his relaxation, right?

17:58.177 --> 18:00.475
Like cuddling up
with a nice...

18:00.913 --> 18:03.643
soft, kitten in his lap?

18:05.384 --> 18:09.286
Maybe my partner
is right after all.

18:09.354 --> 18:11.345
Practice does make perfect.

18:11.423 --> 18:15.883
The show must go on. There's
no business like show business.

18:15.961 --> 18:18.088
Maybe some other time.

18:18.163 --> 18:20.427
I'm gonna hold you to that,
Turbo Man.

18:20.499 --> 18:22.592
You really
played her along, Michael.

18:22.668 --> 18:26.832
That's one tiger that will never
be on the endangered species' list.

18:36.782 --> 18:38.750
What was that all about?

18:39.084 --> 18:41.075
He's snooping around the fire.

18:41.153 --> 18:43.246
I think he found something.

18:44.223 --> 18:47.021
Look, if he's that interested
in fires...

18:48.227 --> 18:51.219
maybe you should give him one
he won't forget.

18:55.701 --> 18:57.896
Michael, I have that
information you requested.

18:57.970 --> 18:58.994
Shoot.

18:59.071 --> 19:00.732
It's a self-contained,
auto-delay fuse.

19:00.806 --> 19:03.138
I'll try to find out which
company manufactured it...

19:03.208 --> 19:06.109
and to whom it was sold.
Also on Circus Major...

19:06.178 --> 19:08.078
although they have
no hidden assets...

19:08.147 --> 19:10.479
it appears they have
plenty of visible debts.

19:10.549 --> 19:14.451
All of which they barely manage to pay
the interest on by the first of each month.

19:14.520 --> 19:17.512
Just in time to keep the
wolf away from the door, huh?

19:17.589 --> 19:19.716
That's a very good way
of putting it, Michael.

19:19.791 --> 19:22.988
Thank you very much.
What about Peter?

19:23.061 --> 19:25.552
Did you find out if there's anybody
who held a grudge against him?

19:25.631 --> 19:26.655
Not to my knowledge.

19:26.732 --> 19:29.496
In fact, it seems he didn't
have an enemy in the world.

19:29.568 --> 19:32.560
There is one thing I found
curious, though. What?

19:32.638 --> 19:34.128
There has been
a good deal of activity...

19:34.206 --> 19:36.265
on the part of
a European holding company...

19:36.341 --> 19:39.504
called ITZ
to buy Circus Major.

19:39.578 --> 19:42.979
Now, I realize holding companies
are always buying something or other.

19:43.048 --> 19:46.984
But seldom bankrupt circuses.
Exactly.

19:47.052 --> 19:51.546
Plus the fact it appears no offer was
ever made directly to Peter or Terry.

19:51.623 --> 19:55.753
Who'd they make it to? Someone
by the name of Jeff Barnes.

19:55.827 --> 19:59.524
Jeff Barnes, huh? See what you
can find out about him, will you?

19:59.865 --> 20:01.389
Oh, there's Terry.

20:08.173 --> 20:09.470
Hi.
Hi.

20:09.541 --> 20:12.408
Where are you off to?
To the bank.

20:12.477 --> 20:15.241
The old mortgage payment,
huh? Oh, you got it.

20:15.314 --> 20:18.647
And as nice as Jeff Barnes is,
he's still a banker inside and out.

20:18.717 --> 20:22.118
Wait a minute, did you say
Jeff Barnes? Yeah, you know him?

20:22.187 --> 20:25.645
No, but I'd certainly like
to make his acquaintance.

20:25.724 --> 20:26.986
Well, come on.

20:28.894 --> 20:31.124
Well, the feeling's mutual,
it's nice meeting you, too.

20:31.196 --> 20:32.788
I'm sorry,
I didn't catch your name.

20:32.864 --> 20:35.196
Well, my fans call me
Turbo Man.

20:35.500 --> 20:36.592
Turbo Man.

20:36.668 --> 20:39.933
Of course, Terry's told me all
about you. Please, sit down.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.834
She says you're going to give
Circus Major a real shot in the arm.

20:43.909 --> 20:46.537
Actually, I was hoping to give
it a shot in the box office.

20:48.213 --> 20:50.511
A shot in the box office.
That's a good one, real good.

20:50.582 --> 20:52.277
Glad you like it.
Tell you the truth...

20:52.351 --> 20:54.979
there isn't anything about
the circus I don't like.

20:55.053 --> 20:56.816
Terry knows this, but...

20:56.888 --> 20:59.379
well, I wanted to be
a lion-tamer myself.

20:59.458 --> 21:03.189
Ran away with the circus four
or five times when I was a boy.

21:03.595 --> 21:07.554
Trouble is my father was a
banker, as was his father...

21:07.633 --> 21:10.261
and I'm kind of stuck
lion-taming this desk.

21:10.335 --> 21:14.431
Plus I have a deep responsibility to
each and every one of my depositors.

21:14.506 --> 21:18.670
Look, if that's a hint, Jeff, say
no more. Here's this month's payment.

21:18.744 --> 21:20.336
Thank you, Terry.

21:20.412 --> 21:24.508
Believe me, if there was any way I
could make this easier, you know I would.

21:24.583 --> 21:29.520
What about finding an outside investor
until Circus Major can get on its feet again?

21:29.888 --> 21:31.651
An outside investor?

21:31.723 --> 21:34.692
Well, you may be good at jumping
through fiery hoops, Turbo Man...

21:34.760 --> 21:38.093
but, I'm afraid you're
not much of a businessman.

21:38.163 --> 21:41.326
No investor in his right mind
would be interested in Circus Major.

21:41.400 --> 21:43.925
I mean, as it is now.

21:44.002 --> 21:46.903
Now, that's funny, because when
I was appearing back East...

21:46.972 --> 21:50.908
I heard rumors
about a company named ITZ.

21:50.976 --> 21:54.309
They said they were interested
in buying out Circus Major.

21:54.379 --> 21:56.108
Is that true, Jeff?

21:56.515 --> 21:58.983
Yes. Yes, somebody from I...

22:00.052 --> 22:03.818
TZ. TZ did contact me a while back...

22:03.889 --> 22:07.620
but I told them that you wouldn't
sell under any conditions.

22:08.360 --> 22:11.090
You wouldn't, would you?
Are you kidding?

22:11.163 --> 22:12.790
Even if my life
depended on it.

22:12.864 --> 22:15.833
Well, that's what I figured. So
I told them to forget about it...

22:15.901 --> 22:18.426
and I haven't
heard from them since.

22:19.137 --> 22:20.968
Does that
answer your question?

22:21.039 --> 22:23.667
I'll think about it
and let you know.

22:24.009 --> 22:27.069
Nice to meet you.
Nice meeting you.

22:27.546 --> 22:29.036
See you at the show tonight,
Jeff.

22:29.114 --> 22:30.513
Oh, yeah, wouldn't miss it
for the world.

22:30.582 --> 22:32.641
Thank you.
Okay. Bye-bye.

22:35.153 --> 22:37.883
Terry, how long have you known
Jeff Barnes?

22:37.956 --> 22:40.982
Since I was old enough
to grab hold of the trapeze.

22:41.059 --> 22:43.755
Don't you ask me
how long ago that was.

22:44.463 --> 22:45.555
Why?

22:46.365 --> 22:47.832
Just curious.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.525
Well, that makes
two of us, Michael.

22:51.970 --> 22:55.269
Me about you.
Oh, I see.

22:56.375 --> 23:01.210
Why is it that I have this suspicion that
you're not really who you say you are?

23:01.613 --> 23:04.343
Probably just
your fertile imagination.

23:05.484 --> 23:06.542
No.

23:07.152 --> 23:11.179
No, it's the way you seem concerned
about what's going on around here.

23:11.256 --> 23:13.918
About what's happening to me.

23:13.992 --> 23:16.859
Well, Terry, the circus is
just one big, happy family.

23:16.928 --> 23:20.364
I mean, if we don't look
out for each other, who will?

23:20.866 --> 23:22.834
Is that the only reason?

23:23.068 --> 23:25.195
I'd be a liar, if I said yes.

23:26.371 --> 23:28.134
I'm glad you didn't.

23:30.442 --> 23:32.535
Okay, I've got
some good news for you.

23:32.611 --> 23:34.272
Couldn't come
at a better time.

23:34.346 --> 23:36.678
We're sold out for tonight.

23:36.748 --> 23:37.908
No kidding?

23:37.983 --> 23:41.441
And tickets are going like cotton
candy for the remaining performances.

23:41.520 --> 23:44.387
Well, terrific. What've you
got to say to that, buddy?

23:44.456 --> 23:45.923
Well, Michael,
with Terry in the air...

23:45.991 --> 23:49.256
and us on the ground,
what can you expect?

23:49.327 --> 23:51.557
I've got a little surprise
for you.

23:52.364 --> 23:55.595
We're not going to be
on the ground for very long.

23:55.667 --> 23:59.103
Michael, that's one surprise
I think I can do without.

24:25.664 --> 24:27.154
All right, Tiger Lady.

24:47.552 --> 24:50.350
Isn't she great,
ladies and gentlemen?

24:53.692 --> 24:57.594
Now, focus your attention
on ring number 3...

24:58.296 --> 25:02.733
for Bombo
and the Fire Brigade.

26:08.066 --> 26:09.590
And now...

26:09.668 --> 26:14.230
direct from the continents
of Europe and Asia...

26:15.206 --> 26:18.972
a daredevil
who has risked his life...

26:19.110 --> 26:20.975
over a thousand times.

26:21.880 --> 26:23.245
And now...

26:23.615 --> 26:27.551
ladies and gentlemen...

26:27.786 --> 26:30.721
the great, the fabulous...

26:30.989 --> 26:33.219
the incomparable...

26:33.925 --> 26:37.622
Turbo Man.

26:52.110 --> 26:54.374
Michael, going undercover
is one thing...

26:54.446 --> 26:57.176
but do I really have to get
lit up like a Christmas tree?

26:57.248 --> 26:59.182
I know how you feel,
partner...

26:59.250 --> 27:01.377
but if they're planning
on closing this circus...

27:01.453 --> 27:04.479
there's no better time to
do it than on opening night.

27:27.779 --> 27:32.011
I have to admit, Devon,
he looks fantastic. Yes.

27:32.083 --> 27:34.881
In spite of that ridiculous
costume he's wearing.

27:34.953 --> 27:37.046
No, I'm talking about KITT.

27:38.990 --> 27:41.390
And now,
ladies and gentlemen...

27:42.093 --> 27:46.427
Turbo Man, will perform
his death-defying feat...

27:47.098 --> 27:49.726
with no protection
whatsoever...

27:50.301 --> 27:53.737
fearless Turbo Man
and his faithful KITT...

27:54.139 --> 27:56.266
will attempt the impossible.

27:56.975 --> 28:01.241
Together they will leap
10 feet into the air...

28:01.312 --> 28:05.578
pass through
the ring of fire unscathed.

28:06.785 --> 28:10.881
Now, Turbo Man, can you do it?

28:26.771 --> 28:31.470
All right, partner. Like they
say in show biz, "Break a leg."

28:31.543 --> 28:33.841
In my case it's "blow a tire."

28:49.527 --> 28:51.961
Turbo Man, here he comes.

28:58.069 --> 29:01.800
Here he comes.

29:16.521 --> 29:18.819
Incendiary bomb, Michael.
Jump.

29:33.872 --> 29:35.863
Michael, are you all right?

29:35.940 --> 29:37.430
Say something.

29:38.710 --> 29:40.837
Anything particular in mind?

29:43.181 --> 29:46.844
Ladies and gentlemen,
the amazing Turbo Man.

29:53.625 --> 29:56.423
It's funny. Very funny.

29:59.931 --> 30:02.866
Don't tell me that was part of
your act. Nobody's that good.

30:02.934 --> 30:07.268
Why do I get the feeling someone
doesn't want Turbo Man in your circus?

30:16.114 --> 30:17.809
You can't imagine
how afraid I was...

30:17.882 --> 30:20.180
when I saw you flying
through the air like that.

30:20.251 --> 30:22.913
It wasn't the flight.
It was the landing.

30:22.987 --> 30:26.923
Michael, will you be serious?
All right, all right.

30:26.991 --> 30:29.255
You have any idea
who planted the bomb?

30:29.327 --> 30:30.988
No.
No.

30:31.062 --> 30:33.553
Did you see
anything unusual tonight?

30:33.631 --> 30:36.122
Opening night at the circus
everything's unusual.

30:36.201 --> 30:38.101
No, you know
what I'm talking about.

30:38.169 --> 30:40.637
No, I didn't see
anything unusual.

30:42.006 --> 30:43.337
Look, I'm sorry.

30:43.942 --> 30:45.705
I just don't want to
see anything happen to you.

30:45.777 --> 30:47.768
Can you understand that?
Yes, I can.

30:47.846 --> 30:50.144
But you don't have to
worry about me.

30:50.215 --> 30:53.207
You don't have to be
afraid for me. But I am.

30:54.118 --> 30:55.710
That's just it.

30:58.323 --> 31:01.884
You know, Terry, in many ways,
you and I are a lot alike.

31:03.027 --> 31:06.394
We live with risk in our lives
so much...

31:06.464 --> 31:08.796
that it's become
second nature to us.

31:08.867 --> 31:12.701
If we stop and think about it,
I don't think we could go on.

31:13.404 --> 31:15.895
That's all there is
to it, huh?

31:16.241 --> 31:17.299
No.

31:29.554 --> 31:31.681
Good night.
Good night.

31:32.857 --> 31:34.848
What's that?
Stay here. Stay here.

31:52.343 --> 31:55.335
Who was it? I don't know.
But, look, I promise you...

31:55.413 --> 31:58.576
I'm going to find out
what's going on here, okay.

31:59.817 --> 32:01.307
Okay. Come on.

32:16.634 --> 32:19.432
Oh, well, if it isn't
the amazing Turbo Man.

32:19.504 --> 32:21.836
Don't rub it in.

32:22.340 --> 32:24.501
I'm not sure
all the parts still work.

32:24.575 --> 32:27.100
You could've gone undercover
as a peanut vendor...

32:27.178 --> 32:29.078
or a roustabout, but no.

32:30.515 --> 32:33.109
I just hope KITT's all right.
She hopes KITT's all right.

32:33.184 --> 32:36.415
My self-diagnostic indicator
suggests only minor damage.

32:36.487 --> 32:38.751
I hope Turbo Man
is as fortunate.

32:38.823 --> 32:40.950
Don't start on me
with Turbo Man.

32:41.025 --> 32:44.017
Any idea who might have done
it? Someone in the circus.

32:44.696 --> 32:47.961
Oh, that's very good, Michael.
Very good. But seriously, folks...

32:48.032 --> 32:51.433
there's a banker in town
that I'm very curious about.

32:51.936 --> 32:55.394
Did you have any luck with the coroners
performing the autopsy on Peter?

32:55.473 --> 32:57.941
Yes, the report
has just come back.

32:58.009 --> 33:00.375
I think we may have something.

33:00.445 --> 33:02.072
"Muscle relaxant."

33:02.146 --> 33:04.842
There's nothing unusual about
that, not for an athlete.

33:04.916 --> 33:08.818
Wait a minute. It's
a very, very large amount.

33:08.886 --> 33:12.720
Enough to cause a shock to his system,
and make him lose his balance...

33:12.790 --> 33:15.281
which according to the tape
is exactly what happened.

33:15.360 --> 33:17.692
There's also a trace of DMSO.

33:17.762 --> 33:21.198
And it's my guess that it is
was used to administer the drug.

33:21.265 --> 33:24.166
At the rate DMSO is absorbed
into the bloodstream...

33:24.235 --> 33:25.395
it had to be...

33:25.470 --> 33:28.462
applied no longer than a couple of
minutes before the reaction occurred.

33:28.539 --> 33:32.703
Anyone patting him on the shoulder
with a small sponge hidden in his hand?

33:32.777 --> 33:33.801
Exactly, Michael.

33:33.878 --> 33:37.006
You know, someone wants to
destroy this circus awfully bad.

33:37.081 --> 33:41.677
When killing Peter didn't do the job,
they turned their sights on Turbo Man.

33:42.453 --> 33:45.718
KITT, did you have any luck in
locating the manufacturer of that fuse?

33:45.790 --> 33:48.987
I'm sorry, Michael, the search of
my data banks turned up negative.

33:49.060 --> 33:50.493
That's all right, partner.

33:50.561 --> 33:54.019
I think I have an idea where
to locate one just like it.

33:55.700 --> 33:58.965
You want me to tell Terry?
Thank you, Michael.

33:59.037 --> 34:01.801
I think I should do
so myself. All right.

34:02.373 --> 34:05.399
I'm gonna set
a little fire of my own.

34:07.612 --> 34:09.239
Catch you later.

34:23.995 --> 34:26.793
KITT, I keep coming back
to one question.

34:27.532 --> 34:28.590
Why?

34:28.666 --> 34:31.498
Michael, we're dealing with
individuals who eat fire...

34:31.569 --> 34:34.231
hang by their hair,
and swallow swords.

34:34.304 --> 34:36.705
If you want to know
why these people do things...

34:36.774 --> 34:40.107
you're asking the wrong
computer. Come on, will you?

34:41.079 --> 34:44.139
I mean, it can't be personal.
They came after me, too.

34:45.650 --> 34:47.583
What's the market value
of that circus land?

34:47.652 --> 34:50.621
It's never been on the market,
so it's hard to project.

34:50.688 --> 34:54.179
No minerals, no natural water,
no unusual value.

34:54.257 --> 34:58.285
It's just another piece of
land. Yeah, well, not to Terry...

34:58.362 --> 35:00.353
and not to the town...

35:00.431 --> 35:03.662
and not to the kids
who come year after year.

35:04.135 --> 35:07.901
And not to ITZ.
Dig a little deeper, will you?

35:11.576 --> 35:14.044
Then who is he?
How should I know?

35:14.545 --> 35:19.346
All I do know is that I have checked
with every circus in operation today...

35:19.417 --> 35:23.183
and this so-called Turbo Man has
never worked for any one of them.

35:23.754 --> 35:26.120
He's bringing in bigger crowds
than Peter did.

35:26.190 --> 35:29.216
It's not the size of the
crowds I'm worrying about now.

35:29.293 --> 35:34.094
Forcing this circus into bankruptcy
is a luxury we can no longer afford.

35:34.432 --> 35:35.626
Meaning?

35:35.700 --> 35:39.363
Meaning we have to take a
more direct route to ownership.

35:41.172 --> 35:44.198
Terry. You're learning,
Bombo. You're learning.

35:44.275 --> 35:45.936
You know, underneath
that makeup you wear...

35:46.010 --> 35:49.468
beats the heart
of a true entrepreneur.

35:49.547 --> 35:51.742
All right, take it easy,
Barnes. Do you want her or not?

35:51.816 --> 35:54.842
I want her. Now.

36:05.463 --> 36:07.590
It looks like Turbo Man's
getting popular.

36:07.665 --> 36:10.759
Let's see how popular he is
with the Tiger Lady, huh?

36:11.435 --> 36:13.528
There's her tent
right over there.

36:19.544 --> 36:21.671
Anyone inside?
Negative, Michael.

36:22.213 --> 36:23.202
All right.

36:23.781 --> 36:25.874
Keep your scanner peeled, huh?

36:42.266 --> 36:44.200
No question about that.

37:16.434 --> 37:17.458
What do you think
you're doing?

37:17.535 --> 37:19.901
Trying to get
your undivided attention.

37:19.971 --> 37:23.668
I'm rehearsing.
No kidding. I'm not.

37:25.376 --> 37:27.207
Well, if you want
my undivided attention...

37:27.278 --> 37:29.075
there are much
better ways of getting it.

37:29.146 --> 37:32.343
Well, why don't you drop the
act? You've lost your audience.

37:32.416 --> 37:35.317
I don't know what you mean.
You know exactly what I mean.

37:35.386 --> 37:37.479
You set the fire yesterday.

37:37.588 --> 37:41.285
Success has gone to your head,
Turbo Man. It's giving you delusions.

37:56.474 --> 37:58.032
All right, get up.

37:58.109 --> 38:00.942
How about it, Tiger?
You're ready to talk?

38:01.012 --> 38:03.003
You're wasting your time.

38:03.080 --> 38:07.414
Speaking of time, I wonder how much time
you're gonna get for killing Peter Major?

38:10.054 --> 38:12.579
First the fire, and now Peter.

38:12.657 --> 38:14.557
You have quite an imagination.

38:14.625 --> 38:18.061
Imagination won't put you
behind bars, but the facts will.

38:18.763 --> 38:22.460
The way I figure it, you're gonna
be about 50 when you get out.

38:22.533 --> 38:25.468
Give or take a year or two
for good behavior.

38:28.372 --> 38:30.203
I didn't kill anybody.

38:30.274 --> 38:32.936
But you know who did.
I don't...

38:33.978 --> 38:35.809
I thought it was an accident.

38:36.647 --> 38:40.583
Then who hired you to start the
fire? I didn't start anything.

38:40.651 --> 38:44.417
Tiger, Tiger, Tiger,
I found the fuse in your tent.

38:44.488 --> 38:46.183
Now who hired you?

38:46.424 --> 38:47.755
All right.

38:48.359 --> 38:51.658
Either you talk to me, or
you talk to the state police.

38:51.729 --> 38:53.128
Your choice.

38:54.765 --> 38:55.925
Bombo.

38:57.401 --> 38:58.459
Why?

38:59.670 --> 39:03.436
I don't know. He just
said I'd be paid well.

39:03.774 --> 39:07.710
What's Bombo's connection
with this banker, Jeff Barnes?

39:07.778 --> 39:10.246
Jeff Barnes?
I don't know any Jeff Barnes.

39:10.314 --> 39:12.612
Tiger.
I don't.

39:12.783 --> 39:14.808
Okay, now will you let me go?

39:14.885 --> 39:17.115
Wait, wait, wait. You've
got one more performance.

39:18.689 --> 39:21.089
KITT, call the police
and have them pick her up.

39:21.158 --> 39:22.955
Right away, Michael.

39:26.731 --> 39:28.028
But why? Who?

39:28.099 --> 39:29.361
I wish we knew, Terry.

39:29.433 --> 39:32.527
Devon, everyone loved Peter.
A circus is family.

39:32.603 --> 39:35.504
You can't mean it was
someone here, one of us?

39:35.573 --> 39:37.564
I'm afraid everything
points to that.

39:37.641 --> 39:40.576
Peter's murder, the fire,
the attempt on Michael's life.

39:40.644 --> 39:42.805
But why now? I don't
understand. What's the point?

39:42.880 --> 39:44.814
This circus has no real value.

39:44.882 --> 39:48.443
Except to the people who love it, the
people who struggle to keep it alive...

39:48.519 --> 39:53.286
in a world of pay TV, satellite
dishes, and Michael Jackson concerts.

39:53.357 --> 39:56.656
I have no answers to your
questions, Terry. Not yet.

39:57.962 --> 39:59.554
But I will have, I promise.

39:59.630 --> 40:01.928
Not only because of what
your father did for me...

40:01.999 --> 40:05.867
but because I have always loved
you, too. And I love the circus.

40:05.936 --> 40:08.871
And the world needs
all the circuses it can get.

40:08.939 --> 40:10.099
Thank you, Devon.

40:10.174 --> 40:12.699
I don't know what I'd do
without you and Turbo Man.

40:12.777 --> 40:13.903
Bombo!

40:26.857 --> 40:28.415
Michael.
Yeah, what is it?

40:28.492 --> 40:31.859
My sensors detect an
unconscious body in the trailer.

40:32.363 --> 40:33.523
Terry.

40:36.000 --> 40:39.265
Devon, what happened?
Where's Terry?

40:39.336 --> 40:42.203
That awful clown.
Bombo?

40:42.807 --> 40:46.436
Yeah, I guess so.
He must have taken her.

40:46.510 --> 40:49.172
He zapped me before I
had a chance, Michael.

40:49.246 --> 40:50.907
You gonna be all right?
Yes, of course.

40:50.981 --> 40:54.417
I'll find him. Believe me,
I'll find him. All right.

41:14.238 --> 41:16.866
Michael, I have that
information you wanted on ITZ.

41:16.941 --> 41:18.067
Lay it on me.

41:18.142 --> 41:20.940
It's not exactly what you'd
call a high-profile corporation.

41:21.011 --> 41:24.777
It has more puzzling twists and
turns than an Agatha Christie novel.

41:24.849 --> 41:27.147
Just get to the heart
of the issue.

41:27.218 --> 41:29.584
Tell me if banker Barnes
is on the payroll?

41:29.653 --> 41:33.145
Yes, Michael. He's a rather
highly paid consultant.

41:33.224 --> 41:35.818
No kidding.
That's exactly what I figured.

41:36.293 --> 41:37.351
Anything else?

41:37.428 --> 41:40.397
I also learned that because of
the proximity of Circus Major...

41:40.464 --> 41:43.058
to a large container port
and a rail terminus...

41:43.133 --> 41:47.467
ITZ wants the land to build a
new computerized assembly plant.

41:47.638 --> 41:50.698
Which means they'll eventually have
to buy up all the surrounding land...

41:50.774 --> 41:52.742
for their warehouses.
Exactly.

41:52.810 --> 41:56.473
And maybe employ
two dozen people at best.

41:56.547 --> 42:00.881
While all the people who lived there all
their lives are gonna have to move elsewhere.

42:00.951 --> 42:04.387
KITT, has ITZ acquired any
other property around here?

42:04.455 --> 42:05.513
Yes, Michael.

42:05.589 --> 42:08.387
They recently purchased a
warehouse just outside of town.

42:08.459 --> 42:10.222
Bingo. Let's hit it.

42:14.398 --> 42:15.831
Can't let you do it.

42:15.900 --> 42:18.994
I can't let you and your circus stand
in the way of this kind of progress.

42:19.069 --> 42:21.230
Progress?
What are you talking about?

42:21.305 --> 42:23.102
You killed Peter.
I had no choice.

42:23.173 --> 42:26.574
You wouldn't sell the circus,
not in a million years.

42:26.877 --> 42:28.367
And you helped him.

42:29.146 --> 42:31.774
After all these years, all the
struggles we went through together.

42:31.849 --> 42:33.146
How could you?

42:33.217 --> 42:37.210
Well, the circus is dying.
It's a dinosaur.

42:39.023 --> 42:40.854
I got my future to think of.

42:42.860 --> 42:45.761
Now, you gonna sign that
contract or not? Never.

42:45.829 --> 42:49.026
This isn't a negotiation.
You don't have a choice.

42:53.437 --> 42:55.701
Michael, why would a man
in Barnes' position...

42:55.773 --> 42:59.766
resort to these kind of
tactics? Good question, pal.

42:59.843 --> 43:03.904
Maybe he sees it as one last shot
to do what his father never could do.

43:03.981 --> 43:06.973
Turn a one-stop town
into a personal fortune.

43:07.051 --> 43:10.145
He knew Terry would never
abandon the circus or Majorville.

43:10.220 --> 43:13.986
My guess is ITZ offered him millions
to get her to change her mind.

43:14.058 --> 43:17.892
I do hope we get there in time,
Michael. So do I, partner. So do I.

43:29.506 --> 43:30.495
Well...

43:32.543 --> 43:34.340
I'm glad you saw reason.

43:44.388 --> 43:45.480
Bombo.

43:46.223 --> 43:48.623
Take her out to the desert.
Michael.

43:48.692 --> 43:49.681
No.

43:53.364 --> 43:55.889
Stop him, stop him.
Come on, move. Move.

44:02.940 --> 44:06.103
There are three people in
that garage, Michael, and...

44:06.176 --> 44:07.302
What?

44:08.812 --> 44:10.939
Now I have seen everything.

44:11.015 --> 44:13.483
What are they going to do?
Kill us with confetti?

44:13.550 --> 44:16.280
Don't count on it, pal.
This is no joke.

44:31.301 --> 44:32.962
Michael, those flames
are a mixture of

44:33.037 --> 44:35.130
phosphorus, gasoline,
and napalm.

44:35.205 --> 44:37.196
They explode, burn,
and stick to their target.

44:37.274 --> 44:40.334
Tiger's crowning achievement,
huh? I'm glad you admire it...

44:40.411 --> 44:44.245
but the heat's too intense
for my pyroclastic lamination.

45:01.131 --> 45:04.692
Can't you hit him? I would if
you could hold this thing still.

45:15.079 --> 45:17.411
That was close.
It's getting hot in here.

45:17.481 --> 45:18.539
You'd better keep me moving.

45:18.615 --> 45:21.379
Our speed is the only thing
keeping those flames from spreading.

45:21.452 --> 45:24.080
All right, let's show him
how you can move, buddy.

45:28.759 --> 45:30.556
Michael,
if we hit his fuel tank...

45:30.627 --> 45:33.255
We won't, pal.
Just the flame thrower.

45:51.548 --> 45:54.483
Get the clown, KITT.
With pleasure, Michael.

46:15.706 --> 46:18.834
You always wanted to be in the
circus, huh? Let's see you fly.

46:24.915 --> 46:26.143
Oh, Michael.

46:27.117 --> 46:31.713
Oh, Michael, thank God. I'm still shaking.
It's okay, babe. It's over. It's over.

46:33.824 --> 46:37.282
I don't know how you do it. Hey,
practice makes perfect, you know.

46:37.361 --> 46:39.226
The roar of the grease paint,
the smell of the crowd.

46:39.296 --> 46:41.992
Michael. There's no
business like show business.

46:57.881 --> 47:01.510
Michael tells me that you're
hiring a new flyer for your act.

47:01.585 --> 47:04.247
I hired the great
Alfredo Mancini.

47:04.321 --> 47:08.451
I lured him away from the Circus Roma by
promising him a percentage of the gate.

47:08.525 --> 47:12.757
Well, I'm sure that he'll be a
very rich man in no time at all.

47:13.764 --> 47:17.461
Michael, do you mind? Hey,
that's what the circus is about.

47:17.534 --> 47:20.230
Sharing the good things in life with
the people you really care about.

47:20.304 --> 47:21.669
Then let me have
some of your cotton candy.

47:21.738 --> 47:25.333
Forget it. It's sticky, and
it's messy, and it's all for me.

47:25.409 --> 47:27.877
Michael, will you please
come here at once?

47:27.945 --> 47:29.708
What's the problem?

47:29.780 --> 47:32.977
The problem is I don't like
bananas in my scanner.

47:33.650 --> 47:35.777
He's just
trying to be friendly.

47:35.853 --> 47:37.047
That's the second problem.

47:37.120 --> 47:39.554
I don't like orangutans,
either.

47:43.794 --> 47:47.423
I want to thank you, Michael.
Or should I say Turbo Man?

47:47.497 --> 47:50.523
Turbo Man is history.
It's Michael from now on.

47:51.401 --> 47:54.564
Anytime you need anything,
you call me, okay?

47:54.638 --> 47:55.662
Okay.

47:57.808 --> 47:59.935
All right, here we go again.
