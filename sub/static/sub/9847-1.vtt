- Yeah.

for Don Atari.

17:24.359 --> 17:26.078
I've been working for him since I was 10.

17:26.160 --> 17:27.512
How old are you now?

17:27.920 --> 17:28.920
Eleven.

17:28.960 --> 17:30.188
Should we go to the hotel?

17:45.160 --> 17:47.230
Pretty strange, you and I
both getting called back

17:47.320 --> 17:49.231
to the big stage like this.

17:49.520 --> 17:52.637

I'm just doing this to get my son back.

gonna accomplish that.

18:06.600 --> 18:07.874
What? You don't think I could be one?

No, it just brings up
some junk from the past.

18:10.880 --> 18:11.915
I didn't have a father.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.956
It's kind of my big issue right now.

- You didn't have a father?
- Nah.

was my dad was a beat cop.

19:44.720 --> 19:46.119
I just have one question.

19:46.200 --> 19:47.235
Yeah?

What in the world is farm-to-table Wi-Fi?

"I totally know
what farm-to-table Wi-Fi is!"

20:00.760 --> 20:03.035

'cause I thought you knew.

20:03.120 --> 20:04.473
I thought you knew!

No, I just didn't want Vip
to think I was uncool! (LAUGHS)

20:11.880 --> 20:13.711

20:13.800 --> 20:15.392
Why didn't we do this sooner?

20:15.640 --> 20:16.960
Because we've both been in hiding

20:18.120 --> 20:19.473

28:49.520 --> 28:52.080
I think we got to shake off
some of the rust.

28:52.160 --> 28:53.388
I was trying out a few new looks,

28:53.480 --> 28:54.708

28:54.800 --> 28:57.360

was it, you know, prunes?

28:57.440 --> 28:59.396

We're going to be the center

30:45.640 --> 30:48.598
I can only pray that nobody from
Child Services attended the show

30:48.680 --> 30:50.591

30:51.040 --> 30:52.109

30:52.200 --> 30:54.111
This is exactly
what we were talking about!

30:54.640 --> 30:57.473
No, Hansel. It's exactly
what you were talking about.

30:57.840 --> 30:59.114

31:48.880 --> 31:50.154
I need to talk to you.

31:51.160 --> 31:53.230
It has to do with
the death of Justin Bieber.

31:53.320 --> 31:55.151
His death is not my problem.

31:55.240 --> 31:58.994
Look, I'm trying to find out
who's killing the pop stars of the world.

31:59.080 --> 32:01.150
And I think you're my only chance.

32:02.080 --> 32:05.231
What part of "not my problem"
did you not understand?

32:05.360 --> 32:06.360
None of it.

32:08.960 --> 32:11.269
So you did understand
the part about it not being my problem,

32:11.360 --> 32:14.670
or you didn't understand any part of it
not being a part of my problem?

32:15.760 --> 32:16.988
No, no, no, Derek.

32:17.120 --> 32:19.634
I think what she's saying is that
she understands what you're saying,

32:19.720 --> 32:20.869
but she doesn't accept it.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.036
Hansel! It's all too confusing.

would help me find myself,

32:25.800 --> 32:27.597

If you help me.

32:46.560 --> 32:48.312
I think we got to play ball with her.

32:48.400 --> 32:49.992
She's got some kind of database

32:52.080 --> 32:53.752
will help us find little Derek.

just because your son is fat

I think so.

01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:22.795
To tell you the truth, we were having
so much sex, I can't remember.

01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:24.717
T ell me about it, muchacho.

01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:25.920
Ugh!

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:29.549
You're beautiful. You have the fire.
You just need to believe it.

01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:30.795
The fire?

01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:32.313
The fire in your face.

01:20:32.840 --> 01:20:35.115
I lost it the day I killed your mom.

01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:39.269
Oh, look. It's a sad, scared little boy

01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:42.796
talking to his fat son
about their feelings.

01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:45.751
You are responsible for all this!

01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:48.149
You lured me to Italy
so you could escape from prison.

01:20:48.280 --> 01:20:50.919
You made Don Atari
and Alexanya hire me to set this trap.

01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:52.708
But enough is enough!

It just doesn't hold up, does it?

01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:30.951
You sleuthed the whole thing out, Derek,

01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:34.396
but failed to de-sleuth
the most important piece of the puzzle.

01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:36.311
I owned the construction company

01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:38.868

Kids Who Can't Read Good.

01:21:57.160 --> 01:21:58.275
It wasn't...

01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:01.313
Wait. You called me "Dad".

01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:03.552
Oh, I guess I did.

01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:06.236
Now you don't have the ceremonial knife!

01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:08.914

Come on, Derek! We need the blood!

01:22:12.280 --> 01:22:14.350
Stop being so emotional, Derek.

01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:16.317
Just give him the goddamn knife.

You actually believed that crap?

Without me, you'd still
be cutting patterns at Men's Wearhouse.

Oh, look,
it's the White Witch from Narnia!

You're saying the legend isn't true?

Why are you doing all of this, then?

01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:31.473
Because Marc, by Marc Jacobs...

01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:35.079

one thing that would gather

01:30:54.480 --> 01:30:55.480
What?

01:30:55.960 --> 01:30:57.598
I lost my baby.

01:30:58.160 --> 01:30:59.309
No.

01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:02.792
I guess kicking the door
down wasn't such a good idea.

01:31:03.800 --> 01:31:06.473
We're going to be a family,
that's all that matters.

01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:07.880
(LAUGHING)

01:31:14.520 --> 01:31:17.273
Wait. Are you sure?

01:31:17.960 --> 01:31:20.474
You're right. We shouldn't.

01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:26.037
Hey. It's okay, Dad.
I don't think Mom would mind.

01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:34.389
Matilda.

01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:36.718
Go to her, Derek.

01:31:37.560 --> 01:31:38.993
You're cool with it?

01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:41.151
I'm totally cool with it.

01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:42.674
I'm dead.

01:31:42.760 --> 01:31:45.069
Literally nothing bothers me anymore.

01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:47.235
MATILDA: Oh, and guess what?

01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:48.992
Mugatu live-streamed all of this

01:31:49.080 --> 01:31:51.150
to every fashion blog on the planet.

01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:53.830
Everybody loves you guys again.

01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:55.429
Did you hear that?

01:31:55.520 --> 01:31:57.397
We did it. We're back.

01:31:57.480 --> 01:31:59.914
And famous. And totally self-realized.

01:32:00.480 --> 01:32:02.277
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

01:32:02.920 --> 01:32:04.273
If you're thinking...

01:32:04.440 --> 01:32:06.908
BOTH: Lava pool party!

01:32:08.760 --> 01:32:10.318
BOTH: No!

01:32:13.760 --> 01:32:14.829
They're back!

01:32:14.920 --> 01:32:17.070
After six weeks in the burn ward,

01:32:17.160 --> 01:32:19.310
their disgusting facial scars healed

01:32:19.400 --> 01:32:21.709
by a miraculous hot lava treatment

01:32:21.800 --> 01:32:24.997

<i>now Zoolander's wife.</i>

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:38.479

<i>Who Want To Be Taken Seriously</i>

<i>And Maybe Transition

01:32:45.240 --> 01:32:48.994
Hansel, definitely back
and fully self-realized.

01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:51.753
<i>Now a model parent. And father of ten.</i>

01:32:51.840 --> 01:32:53.751

(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

01:33:15.880 --> 01:33:17.393
<i>Pumped up with the sex appeal</i>

01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:19.112
