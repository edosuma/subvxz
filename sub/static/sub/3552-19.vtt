WEBVTT

00:01.172 --> 00:02.173
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.173 --> 00:04.135
RENEE HAD GOOD NEWS.

00:04.135 --> 00:05.376
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED.

00:05.376 --> 00:07.678
OH, HOW WONDERFUL.

00:07.678 --> 00:10.381
GABY'S TALENT FOR SHOPPING
BECAME AN OPPORTUNITY.

00:10.381 --> 00:12.083
THE PERSONAL SHOPPER JOB?

00:12.083 --> 00:13.614
FOR YOU, MY DEAR,
IT IS A CALLING.

00:13.614 --> 00:16.347
THINGS HEATED UP
BETWEEN TOM AND LYNETTE.

00:16.347 --> 00:18.049
OH, MY GOD. I'M ON FIRE!
 OH!

00:18.049 --> 00:21.021
AAH! OH! (gasps)

00:21.021 --> 00:23.254
M.J. AND SUSAN BEGAN
THEIR RECOVERY

00:23.254 --> 00:25.256
AFTER MIKE'S DEATH.

00:25.256 --> 00:26.797
(whispers) OH, SWEETIE.

00:26.797 --> 00:31.202
THE POLICE QUESTIONED BREE
AND ADVANCED THEIR CASE.

00:31.202 --> 00:32.103
JUDGE KEMP JUST SIGNED OFF
ON THAT WARRANT.

00:32.103 --> 00:33.564
THAT WAS FAST.

00:33.564 --> 00:35.106
SOONER I CAN PROVE
SHE'S GUILTY,

00:35.106 --> 00:37.408
SOONER I CAN WATCH HER
PAY FOR IT.

00:43.614 --> 00:46.377
(Mary Alice) WHEN IT CAME
TO THROWING A BRIDAL SHOWER,

00:46.377 --> 00:48.048
BREE VAN DE KAMP BELIEVED

00:48.048 --> 00:52.823
THAT EVERYTHING SHOULD BE DONE
WITH TASTE AND DIGNITY.

00:52.823 --> 00:57.258
THERE SHOULD BE
PERSONALIZED PARTY FAVORS...

00:57.258 --> 01:01.832
DELICATE PASTEL FLOWERS...

01:01.832 --> 01:06.397
ELEGANT REFRESHMENTS...

01:06.397 --> 01:09.670
AND SHE INSISTED
ON TRADITIONAL GIFTS,

01:09.670 --> 01:14.675
EVEN IF THEY RECEIVED
AN UNTRADITIONAL RESPONSE.

01:14.675 --> 01:17.308
WHAT THE HELL? MIXING BOWLS?

01:17.308 --> 01:18.809
NESTING MIXING BOWLS.

01:18.809 --> 01:20.611
COME ON. THIS IS A SHOWER.

01:20.611 --> 01:24.215
ISN'T THERE ONE GIFT OVER THERE
THAT'S, UH,

01:24.215 --> 01:26.857
YOU KNOW, BUZZING?

01:26.857 --> 01:28.359
OH! I KNOW JUST THE ONE.

01:28.359 --> 01:30.221
(Renee) OH, HERE WE GO.

01:30.221 --> 01:31.792
I USE MINE ALL THE TIME.

01:31.792 --> 01:33.564
I USED TO DO IT BY HAND,

01:33.564 --> 01:36.227
BUT THIS GETS THE JOB DONE
SO MUCH FASTER.

01:36.227 --> 01:38.799
AH. NOW WE'RE TALKING.

01:38.799 --> 01:42.373
IT'S A BRAND-NEW...

01:42.373 --> 01:44.635
IMMERSION BLENDER?

01:44.635 --> 01:47.608
NOW YOU CAN PUREE SOUPS
RIGHT IN THE POT.

01:47.608 --> 01:52.143
SO IS EVERY GIFT GONNA BE
KITCHEN-RELATED?

01:52.143 --> 01:53.444
WELL, THAT'S THE THEME

01:53.444 --> 01:55.186
THAT I HAD LETTERPRESSED
ON THE INVITATIONS.

01:55.186 --> 01:58.149
OKAY, I MIGHT HAVE TO SEND
SOMEONE OUT ON A BEER RUN.

01:58.149 --> 02:00.251
WELL, I AM SORRY TO DISAPPOINT
YOU, BUT IF YOU'RE LOOKING

02:00.251 --> 02:03.123
FOR THAT KIND OF SHOWER,
YOU'RE IN THE WRONG PLACE.

02:03.123 --> 02:05.196
OH, BREE, CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

02:06.227 --> 02:09.259
(sighs)

02:09.259 --> 02:11.162
(sets glass down)

02:11.162 --> 02:13.664
OKAY, SO I HAD A FEELING YOUR
SHOWER MIGHT BE KIND OF A DUD,

02:13.664 --> 02:17.137
SO I MAY HAVE SORT OF HIRED
A MALE STRIPPER.

02:17.137 --> 02:18.309
GABY, YOU DIDN'T.

02:18.309 --> 02:21.172
(doorbell rings)
 THERE HE IS, SO YAY!

02:21.172 --> 02:23.544
NO. MALE STRIPPERS ARE
BEYOND DEGRADING,

02:23.544 --> 02:26.146
AND I DON'T CHOOSE TO BE
HUMILIATED IN MY OWN HOME.

02:26.146 --> 02:28.148
NOW PLEASE, GET RID OF THEM.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.821
(sighs)

02:33.924 --> 02:37.157
BREE VAN DE KAMP, WE HAVE
A WARRANT FOR YOUR ARREST.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.729
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. SHE ALSO HAS
THE RIGHT TO REMAIN HORNY.

02:38.729 --> 02:40.291
LISTEN, CHANGE OF PLANS--

02:40.291 --> 02:42.293
MA'AM, I'M GONNA NEED
YOU TO STAND ASIDE.

02:42.293 --> 02:44.335
JUST TAKE THE MONEY AND GO.
AND TELL THE AGENCY

02:44.335 --> 02:46.837
THREE DUMPY STRIPPERS
DOES NOT EQUAL ONE HOT ONE.

02:49.340 --> 02:50.901
WHAT?

02:50.901 --> 02:53.344
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST
FOR THE MURDER OF RAMON SANCHEZ.
 (handcuffs click)

02:53.344 --> 02:55.446
WHAT? OH, MY GOD.

02:55.446 --> 02:57.578
BREE, WHAT'S GOING ON?

02:57.578 --> 03:00.251
OH, I'M SURE IT'S JUST
A MISUNDERSTANDING.

03:00.251 --> 03:02.182
IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO?

03:02.182 --> 03:03.614
YES. I JUST PUT THE MINI QUICHES
IN THE OVEN.

03:03.614 --> 03:06.257
WOULD YOU BE A DEAR AND TAKE
THEM OUT BEFORE THEY BURN?

03:10.190 --> 03:13.224
YES, BREE VAN DE KAMP BELIEVED

03:13.224 --> 03:15.666
IN DOING EVERYTHING
WITH DIGNITY...

03:17.528 --> 03:34.545
EVEN IN THE MOST UNDIGNIFIED
OF CIRCUMSTANCES.

03:34.545 --> 03:38.719
SOMETIMES NO MATTER
HOW MUCH WE PLAN...

03:40.251 --> 03:44.525
THINGS DON'T TURN OUT
THE WAY WE EXPECT.

03:44.525 --> 03:48.259
A STERLING REPUTATION...

03:48.259 --> 03:51.702
MAY BECOME TARNISHED.

03:51.702 --> 03:55.406
A CLEAR EXPLANATION...

03:55.406 --> 03:58.238
MIGHT GET MESSY.

03:58.238 --> 04:01.812
AN IDEAL ARRANGEMENT...

04:01.812 --> 04:05.716
COULD FALL APART IN A FLASH.
 (camera shutter clicks)

04:05.716 --> 04:09.750
AND ONE PERSON
MAY END UP PAYING THE PRICE...

04:11.282 --> 04:14.955
FOR A CRIME THAT EVERYONE
THOUGHT WAS SHARED.

04:17.958 --> 04:19.560
HONEY, ARE YOU OKAY?

04:19.560 --> 04:22.262
YEAH, THANKS TO BOB.
HE BAILED ME OUT.

04:22.262 --> 04:25.035
WHAT HAPPENED?
WHAT DO THEY HAVE ON YOU?
 VERY LITTLE--

04:25.035 --> 04:27.838
ORSON'S RIDICULOUS LETTER,
WHICH IS INADMISSIBLE IN COURT,

04:27.838 --> 04:30.301
SINCE HE'S... GONE,

04:30.301 --> 04:32.503
AND A VERY CRYPTIC
PHONE CONVERSATION

04:32.503 --> 04:34.545
WHICH CAN EASILY
BE EXPLAINED AWAY.

04:34.545 --> 04:36.006
OH, THANK GOD.

04:36.006 --> 04:38.679
WELL, THEY ALSO HAVE
BREE'S FINGERPRINT.

04:38.679 --> 04:39.880
ON WHAT?

04:39.880 --> 04:41.812
A BUTTON
ON THE VICTIM'S SHIRT.

04:41.812 --> 04:43.283
(gasps)

04:43.283 --> 04:44.815
WHEN WE WERE WRAPPING HIM UP
IN THE TABLECLOTH,

04:44.815 --> 04:47.057
I NOTICED THAT HIS SHIRT
WAS UNBUTTONED.

04:47.057 --> 04:48.719
YOU TIDIED UP THE DEAD GUY?

04:48.719 --> 04:50.290
I FELT IT WAS RESPECTFUL
AT THE TIME.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.763
OBVIOUSLY, I SEE THINGS
DIFFERENTLY NOW.

04:52.763 --> 04:54.024
(sighs)

04:54.024 --> 04:56.066
WH--

04:56.066 --> 04:58.369
WELL, WE'RE NOT GONNA LET HER
TAKE THE BLAME FOR THIS.

04:58.369 --> 05:00.571
YEAH, WE'RE ALL IN THIS
TOGETHER.
 WHOA, WHOA. WHOA. WHOA.

05:00.571 --> 05:02.703
IF WE CONFESS,
THEY'LL FIND OUT ABOUT CARLOS,

05:02.703 --> 05:04.605
AND THEY COULD PUT HIM
AWAY FOREVER.

05:04.605 --> 05:07.478
SO WHAT? WE LET BREE
TAKE THE FALL FOR US?

05:07.478 --> 05:08.979
YEAH, THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

05:08.979 --> 05:11.311
NO, I'M JUST SAYING,
WE SHOULD THINK THIS THROUGH.
 WELL--

05:11.311 --> 05:12.843
LADIES, STOP.

05:12.843 --> 05:15.816
NOTHING IS GONNA HAPPEN TO ME.
THE POLICE HAVE NO CASE.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.388
AND OF ALL OF US,

05:17.388 --> 05:20.320
I AM IN THE BEST POSITION
TO TAKE THIS ON RIGHT NOW.

05:20.320 --> 05:23.824
I HAVE NO JOB, NO SMALL CHILDREN
TO LOOK AFTER.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.826
BUT YOU DO HAVE A HALO
OVER YOUR HEAD.

05:25.826 --> 05:30.501
YEAH, BREE.
IT'S INCREDIBLY GENEROUS.

05:30.501 --> 05:32.763
BOB, YOU SWEAR YOU'RE GONNA
GET HER OFF, RIGHT?

05:32.763 --> 05:35.406
ACTUALLY, SHE NEEDS
A CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY.

05:35.406 --> 05:37.908
I KNOW THE PERFECT GUY.
HE'S A REAL SHARK.

05:37.908 --> 05:39.770
HE'S NOT CHEAP,
BUT HE'S WORTH IT.

05:39.770 --> 05:42.473
WELL, OBVIOUSLY,
WE'RE GONNA PAY FOR IT.

05:42.473 --> 05:44.475
YES.
 YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

05:44.475 --> 05:48.449
NO ARGUING. YOU ARE DOING
SOMETHING HUGE FOR US.

05:48.449 --> 05:50.381
WELL, THANK YOU, BUT I PROMISE
YOU, IT'S NOT GOING TO BE HUGE

05:50.381 --> 05:54.555
BECAUSE NOTHING IS
GOING TO HAPPEN.

05:54.555 --> 05:57.357
I SWEAR TO GOD,
THIS WOMAN IS GUILTY.

05:57.357 --> 05:59.059
IF SHE WALKS,
I AM GONNA LOSE IT.

05:59.059 --> 06:00.461
YOU DON'T HAVE TO CONVINCE ME,

06:00.461 --> 06:01.662
BUT A JURY'S
A WHOLE NOTHER STORY.

06:01.662 --> 06:03.363
THERE'S NO MOTIVE,
NO CONNECTION TO THE VICTIM.

06:03.363 --> 06:07.398
THEN WE HAVE TO FIND ONE,
ALL RIGHT? FAST.

06:07.398 --> 06:08.669
ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE NOT OVERREACTING

06:08.669 --> 06:09.900
BECAUSE SHE DUMPED
YOUR PARTNER?

06:09.900 --> 06:12.803
I DON'T THINK
SHE JUST DUMPED HIM.

06:12.803 --> 06:14.645
I THINK SHE MIGHT BE THE REASON
CHUCK'S DEAD.

06:14.645 --> 06:16.106
COME ON.

06:16.106 --> 06:17.748
WE NEED TO KEEP DIGGING.

06:24.415 --> 06:26.817
NO. NO WAY.

06:26.817 --> 06:27.888
CARLOS!

06:27.888 --> 06:29.520
I AM NOT GONNA LET BREE

06:29.520 --> 06:31.492
TAKE THE FALL
FOR A CRIME I COMMITTED.

06:31.492 --> 06:33.393
OKAY. WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING STUPID

06:33.393 --> 06:36.396
AND MACHO AND NOBLE, JUST SIT
YOUR ASS DOWN AND LISTEN TO ME!

06:37.528 --> 06:38.699
OR STAND YOUR ASS THERE
AND LISTEN TO ME.

06:38.699 --> 06:40.471
YOU CAN'T TURN YOURSELF IN.

06:40.471 --> 06:42.503
WHY NOT?
I'M THE ONE WHO DID IT.

06:42.503 --> 06:44.174
YOU'VE ALREADY BEEN TO JAIL
TWICE.

06:44.174 --> 06:46.106
YOU GET A THIRD STRIKE, THEY'RE
GONNA PUT YOU AWAY FOR LIFE.

06:46.106 --> 06:48.439
SO WHAT, I'M SUPPOSED TO
SEND BREE IN MY PLACE?

06:48.439 --> 06:49.640
BREE'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

06:49.640 --> 06:51.442
THE EVIDENCE AGAINST HER
IS VERY FLIMSY,

06:51.442 --> 06:54.044
AND WE'RE GETTING HER
SOME HOTSHOT DEFENSE ATTORNEY.

06:54.044 --> 06:55.486
WE?

06:55.486 --> 06:57.017
WHO IS "WE"?

06:57.017 --> 06:58.549
THE GIRLS AND I.

06:58.549 --> 07:00.591
WE DECIDED SINCE BREE'S
IN THE HOT SEAT,

07:00.591 --> 07:01.922
THE LEAST WE COULD DO IS
PAY HER LEGAL FEES.

07:01.922 --> 07:05.726
YEAH, A--AND I'M
ALL IN FAVOR OF THAT, BUT...

07:05.726 --> 07:08.759
(sighs) HOW ARE
WE SUPPOSED TO AFFORD THIS?

07:08.759 --> 07:12.603
I JUST QUIT MY JOB AND I HAVE
A LEAD ON A NONPROFIT,

07:12.603 --> 07:14.905
BUT IT IS HARDLY
GONNA PAY ANYTHING.

07:14.905 --> 07:17.968
OKAY, RELAX.
RELAX. SIT DOWN.

07:19.540 --> 07:20.711
LOOK...

07:20.711 --> 07:24.044
I'M WORKING NOW.

07:24.044 --> 07:25.846
NO OFFENSE, BUT I DON'T THINK
PERSONAL SHOPPERS

07:25.846 --> 07:28.048
MAKE HOTSHOT DEFENSE ATTORNEY
MONEY.

07:28.048 --> 07:30.080
OKAY, SERIOUSLY, YOU NEED TO
KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT AND LIE LOW

07:30.080 --> 07:31.622
UNTIL THIS BREE THING
PLAYS OUT.

07:31.622 --> 07:34.124
I JUST WISH THAT THERE WAS
SOMETHING I COULD DO.

07:34.124 --> 07:36.156
CARLOS,

07:36.156 --> 07:38.458
LOOK...

07:38.458 --> 07:41.632
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE TIMES
WHEN THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO

07:41.632 --> 07:43.494
IS DO NOTHING.

07:49.540 --> 07:52.503
WHAT ABOUT HIS SUITS?

07:52.503 --> 07:54.905
I'M GIVING IT ALL AWAY.

07:56.577 --> 07:58.609
IT'S WHAT MIKE
WOULD'VE WANTED.

08:01.752 --> 08:04.114
I THINK I'LL KEEP THESE.

08:04.114 --> 08:08.559
M.J. ALWAYS SAYS HE'S GOTTA
FILL DADDY'S SHOES.

08:08.559 --> 08:11.622
SO IF I SAVE A PAIR,
SOMEDAY...

08:11.622 --> 08:13.664
HE WILL KNOW THAT HE DID.

08:17.127 --> 08:18.128
ARE YOU CRYING?

08:18.128 --> 08:19.970
NO. NO.

08:21.802 --> 08:23.674
(sniffles)

08:23.674 --> 08:26.837
CAN YOU GRAB THAT STUFF
ON THE SHELF?
 YEAH.

08:28.979 --> 08:30.681
WHAT'S THIS?

08:31.842 --> 08:33.683
I DON'T KNOW.

08:33.683 --> 08:35.885
NEVER SEEN IT BEFORE.

08:35.885 --> 08:39.119
HMM. I'LL GRAB MIKE'S KEYS.

08:39.119 --> 08:42.823
UM, MAYBE YOU OPENING IT
IS NOT A GOOD IDEA.

08:42.823 --> 08:43.994
WHY NOT?

08:43.994 --> 08:45.596
BECAUSE IT'S IN YOUR HOUSE,

08:45.596 --> 08:47.097
IN YOUR BEDROOM,
BUT IT'S LOCKED.

08:47.097 --> 08:49.730
SO MAYBE MIKE DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO KNOW WHAT WAS IN IT.

08:49.730 --> 08:51.702
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

08:51.702 --> 08:53.063
I HAVE A BOX LIKE THIS
IN MY HOUSE

08:53.063 --> 08:54.935
THAT I WOULD NOT WANT
BOB TO SEE.

08:54.935 --> 08:58.008
WHY? WHAT'S IN IT?
NO. DON'T ANSWER THAT.

08:58.008 --> 09:00.741
(sighs)

09:00.741 --> 09:04.244
IT'S PROBABLY
JUST PAPERS AND STUFF.

09:04.244 --> 09:05.776
YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT,

09:05.776 --> 09:10.621
BUT IF IT'S SOMETHING ELSE,
YOU MAY NOT WANT TO KNOW.

09:12.723 --> 09:15.726
WELL,
WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST I DO?

09:15.726 --> 09:17.828
THROW IT AWAY?

09:17.828 --> 09:19.630
KEEP IT ON THE SHELF?

09:21.692 --> 09:24.564
OKAY, HOW ABOUT THIS--YOU GO
MAKE YOURSELF A NICE CUP OF TEA,

09:24.564 --> 09:27.668
I WILL OPEN IT, AND IF IT'S
JUST PAPERS, I'LL TELL YOU?

09:27.668 --> 09:29.299
AND IF IT'S SOMETHING ELSE?

09:29.299 --> 09:31.702
I WILL DECIDE
IF YOU SHOULD SEE IT.

09:31.702 --> 09:33.273
I'M JUST TRYING
TO PROTECT YOU, SUSAN.

09:33.273 --> 09:34.775
MEN HAVE SECRETS.

09:34.775 --> 09:36.607
MIKE DIDN'T.

09:36.607 --> 09:39.880
HE KINDA DID.

09:44.955 --> 09:46.957
HEY, THANKS FOR
BRINGING THAT OVER.

09:46.957 --> 09:48.588
YOU CAN KEEP IT.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.691
WHO THINKS A CAKE STAND'S
A GOOD GIFT FOR A BRIDAL SHOWER?

09:50.691 --> 09:52.322
ME. I GAVE IT TO YOU.

09:52.322 --> 09:55.766
OH. WELL, YOU OWE ME
A LESS SUCKY PRESENT.

09:55.766 --> 09:58.669
(refrigerator door opens)
 AND BY THE WAY, I THINK YOU GUYS
OWE ME A WHOLE NEW SHOWER.

09:58.669 --> 10:00.671
I MEAN, WHEN THE HOST
GETS ARRESTED FOR MURDER,

10:00.671 --> 10:01.972
IT KINDA PUTS A DAMPER
ON THINGS.

10:01.972 --> 10:03.804
YEAH, WEIRD.

10:03.804 --> 10:05.806
AND WHAT'S UP
WITH THE COPS IN THIS TOWN?

10:05.806 --> 10:08.138
LAST WEEK, THEY HAULED BEN
IN ABOUT SOME BODY THEY FOUND.

10:08.138 --> 10:09.640
NOW BREE?

10:09.640 --> 10:11.682
I'M SURE THEY'LL STRAIGHTEN IT
OUT. THANKS AGAIN FOR THIS.

10:11.682 --> 10:13.343
WHO'S THE CAKE FOR?

10:13.343 --> 10:14.915
TOM.
IT'S HIS BIRTHDAY TOMORROW,

10:14.915 --> 10:18.889
AND I AM IMPLEMENTING PHASE TWO
OF OPERATION GET TOM BACK.

10:18.889 --> 10:21.722
I'M GUESSING PHASE ONE
WAS A SUCCESS.

10:21.722 --> 10:24.194
IT WAS GREAT, RIGHT UP
UNTIL HE CAUGHT ON FIRE

10:24.194 --> 10:27.798
AND THEN REALIZED THE ENTIRE
EVENING HAD BEEN A WEB OF LIES.

10:27.798 --> 10:29.199
BUT RIGHT BEFORE THAT,

10:29.199 --> 10:33.063
THERE WAS THIS MOMENT,
THIS LOOK BETWEEN US,

10:33.063 --> 10:35.405
LIKE WE WERE
TOM AND LYNETTE AGAIN.

10:35.405 --> 10:37.167
REALLY?

10:37.167 --> 10:39.740
I COULD SEE IT IN HIS EYES.

10:39.740 --> 10:42.312
TOM STILL LOVES ME.

10:43.674 --> 10:45.315
SO BIRTHDAY BOY,

10:45.315 --> 10:47.217
WHAT DO YOU WANNA DO
FOR YOUR BIG DAY TOMORROW?

10:47.217 --> 10:49.780
OH, LET'S JUST, UH, GO OUT
FOR DINNER OR SOMETHING.

10:49.780 --> 10:51.682
THAT'S IT?
I COULD HAVE A PARTY.

10:51.682 --> 10:52.953
(chuckles)

10:52.953 --> 10:56.056
INVITE YOUR FRIENDS OVER,
OPEN UP SOME CHAMPAGNE.

10:56.056 --> 10:57.287
OH, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT THAT.

10:57.287 --> 10:58.989
THE KIDS ARE THROWING ME
A LITTLE PARTY THURSDAY.

10:58.989 --> 11:01.361
OH. WELL, THEN I GUESS

11:01.361 --> 11:04.795
WE'LL HAVE TO COME UP WITH
SOME OTHER WAY TO CELEBRATE.

11:04.795 --> 11:06.837
SOUNDS GOOD.

11:06.837 --> 11:09.669
HEY. AREN'T YOU
FORGETTING SOMETHING?

11:09.669 --> 11:10.941
OH.

11:12.672 --> 11:13.904
MWAH.

11:13.904 --> 11:16.176
THANK YOU, BUT I MEANT
YOUR DIVORCE PAPERS.

11:16.176 --> 11:17.878
OH.

11:17.878 --> 11:19.780
AS MUCH AS I HAVE ENJOYED
SLEEPING NEXT TO THEM

11:19.780 --> 11:21.211
FOR THE PAST THREE WEEKS,

11:21.211 --> 11:23.814
MAYBE THEY COULD MAKE THEIR WAY
OVER TO LYNETTE SOMETIME SOON?

11:23.814 --> 11:25.756
(sighs) IT'S JUST BEEN
SO HECTIC AT WORK.

11:25.756 --> 11:27.718
I HAVEN'T HAD A SECOND TO CALL
THE PROCESS SERVER.

11:27.718 --> 11:29.259
NO, BUT ANYBODY
CAN DELIVER THEM, RIGHT?

11:29.259 --> 11:30.791
I MEAN, WHAT ABOUT
YOUR ASSISTANT?

11:30.791 --> 11:33.724
I DON'T THINK THAT
THAT'S APPROPRIATE.

11:33.724 --> 11:36.166
WELL, I COULD...
HAVE A MESSENGER?

11:36.166 --> 11:39.169
JANE, HONEY, IT'LL GET DONE.

11:39.169 --> 11:41.732
I'M JUST REALLY BUSY
RIGHT NOW. (chuckles)

11:41.732 --> 11:44.775
OKAY.

11:44.775 --> 11:46.706
I LOVE YOU,
AND I LOOK FORWARD

11:46.706 --> 11:48.979
TO SPENDING MANY MORE BIRTHDAYS
TOGETHER.

11:48.979 --> 11:52.712
YOU ARE THE BEST,
AND NOW I REALLY AM LATE.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.845
I WILL SEE YOU TONIGHT.

11:57.788 --> 12:01.221
(door opens and closes)

12:03.493 --> 12:05.255
BOB JUST CALLED.
I GOTTA RUN.

12:05.255 --> 12:08.258
WHOA. WHOA. HANG ON.
WHAT ABOUT THE BOX?

12:08.258 --> 12:09.399
HUH? THE WHAT?

12:09.399 --> 12:11.331
THE BOX...

12:11.331 --> 12:13.333
THAT'S IN YOUR HANDS?

12:13.333 --> 12:15.465
OH, THE BOX. I...

12:15.465 --> 12:17.307
ACTUALLY COULDN'T OPEN IT.

12:17.307 --> 12:18.769
YOU WERE UP THERE
FOR 20 MINUTES.

12:18.769 --> 12:21.912
I FEEL ASLEEP.
MAN, YOU HAVE A COMFORTABLE BED.

12:21.912 --> 12:23.914
TALK TO YOU LATER.

12:23.914 --> 12:25.445
OH, MY GOD.

12:25.445 --> 12:27.517
IS IT THAT BAD?

12:27.517 --> 12:29.980
LISTEN TO ME.

12:29.980 --> 12:34.785
MIKE IS NOT DEFINED BY WHAT IS
OR ISN'T INSIDE THIS BOX.

12:34.785 --> 12:37.757
OKAY. I HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW.
I'M HIS WIFE.

12:37.757 --> 12:40.791
I KNOW. I'M JUST TRYING
TO PROTECT BOTH OF YOU GUYS.

12:40.791 --> 12:41.892
LEE--

12:41.892 --> 12:44.134
SUSAN, PLEASE,
TRUST ME ON THIS.

13:04.214 --> 13:06.216
(indistinct conversations)

13:06.216 --> 13:07.517
(elevator bell dings)

13:07.517 --> 13:09.019
(elevator doors open)

13:10.360 --> 13:12.562
HI!

13:12.562 --> 13:15.395
WELCOME TO CUMBERLY'S
PERSONAL SHOPPING SERVICE.

13:15.395 --> 13:16.526
CAN I HELP YOU
WITH SOMETHING?

13:16.526 --> 13:20.300
I SEE WE HAVE
VERY... SIMILAR TASTE.

13:20.300 --> 13:23.373
I ALWAYS WORK WITH MARGARET.
IS SHE HERE?

13:23.373 --> 13:24.234
OH,
YOU DON'T WANT MARGARET.

13:24.234 --> 13:25.906
HER IDEA OF FASHION IS

13:25.906 --> 13:28.178
WEARING ONE NORMAL SHOE
AND ONE CLUNKY SHOE.

13:28.178 --> 13:30.240
SHE HAS A PROSTHETIC LEG.

13:30.240 --> 13:32.512
AND THAT'S WHY
SHE'S MY HERO.

13:35.245 --> 13:37.918
(sighs) LAZARO! WHAT GIVES?

13:37.918 --> 13:39.249
YOU SAID I'D BE KICKING ASS
AT THIS JOB.

13:39.249 --> 13:42.022
IT TAKES TIME TO BUILD
A CLIENT BASE, GABY.

13:42.022 --> 13:43.423
STICK WITH IT, OKAY?

13:43.423 --> 13:45.355
FIVE, SIX MONTHS FROM NOW,
YOU'LL BE OUR TOP SELLER.

13:45.355 --> 13:47.327
SIX MONTHS? I DON'T HAVE
THAT KIND OF TIME.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.129
I NEED MONEY QUICK.

13:49.129 --> 13:51.331
I'M SORRY. MOST OF THE LADIES
WHO COME IN HERE

13:51.331 --> 13:52.602
ALREADY HAVE
A PERSONAL SHOPPER.

13:52.602 --> 13:54.364
OH.

13:54.364 --> 13:57.237
YOU KNOW, YOU COULD TRY
THE MEN'S DEPARTMENT.

13:57.237 --> 13:59.839
YOU WOULD BE VERY PERSUASIVE
OVER THERE.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.371
HUH.

14:01.371 --> 14:03.914
WELL, I'VE ALWAYS BEEN ABLE
TO GET MEN TO BUY THINGS FOR ME.

14:03.914 --> 14:05.445
HOW HARD COULD IT BE
TO GET THEM

14:05.445 --> 14:07.347
TO BUY THINGS FROM ME?
(chuckles)

14:07.347 --> 14:08.949
MM-HMM. JUST WEAR SOMETHING
SEXY, SHOW A LITTLE CLEAVAGE,

14:08.949 --> 14:11.151
AND MAYBE LOSE
THE WEDDING RING.

14:11.151 --> 14:12.182
SERIOUSLY?

14:12.182 --> 14:14.424
OH, YES.
GUYS TEND TO SPEND MORE

14:14.424 --> 14:16.526
WHEN THEY THINK THEY HAVE A SHOT
WITH THE HOT SALESGIRL.

14:16.526 --> 14:18.488
LAZARO--
 I KNOW. IT'S DEMEANING
AND DEGRADING.

14:18.488 --> 14:22.292
I SHOULDN'T HAVE EVEN--
 NO, NO, NO, NO. I JUST NEED
TO KNOW, SHOW I LOSE THE JACKET?

14:22.292 --> 14:24.294
'CAUSE THESE THINGS ARE
A LOT MORE PERSUASIVE

14:24.294 --> 14:26.336
WHEN THEY'RE OUT.

14:26.336 --> 14:29.169
MM-HMM.
 (chuckles)

14:29.169 --> 14:33.273
(indistinct conversations,
telephone ringing in distance)

14:33.273 --> 14:36.306
I DON'T CARE
WHAT THE D.A. SAYS.

14:36.306 --> 14:39.479
THERE'S NO CASE.
MY GUY'S INNOCENT.

14:39.479 --> 14:42.152
PLEASE STOP CALLING IT
A BODY.

14:42.152 --> 14:45.315
IT'S A FOOT, AN EAR,
AND A FLAP OF SKIN.

14:45.315 --> 14:47.557
DO THESE HAVE RAISINS?
'CAUSE THAT GROSSES ME OUT.

14:47.557 --> 14:49.089
NO.

14:49.089 --> 14:51.321
NO. OKAY. LOOK, I GOTTA GO.
UM, MY 11:00's HERE.

14:51.321 --> 14:52.462
YEAH. OKAY.

14:52.462 --> 14:54.664
(beep)
 SORRY I'M LATE.

14:54.664 --> 14:56.496
UH, NOT A PROBLEM, MR. WESTON.

14:56.496 --> 14:59.970
(mouth full) MMM.
CALL ME TRIP.

14:59.970 --> 15:01.301
THIS IS AMAZING.

15:01.301 --> 15:02.472
WELL, I DON'T LIKE TO BRAG,

15:02.472 --> 15:04.904
BUT I AM FAMOUS
FOR MY ORANGE-GLAZED MUFFINS.

15:04.904 --> 15:08.278
YEAH. UH, BOB SAID THAT
YOU WERE ONE HELL OF A BAKER,

15:08.278 --> 15:10.440
BUT HE DIDN'T TELL ME MUCH
ABOUT YOUR CASE.

15:10.440 --> 15:13.543
WELL, THE WHOLE THING IS
QUITE RIDICULOUS.

15:13.543 --> 15:16.316
THE POLICE FOUND A DEAD MAN
AT A CONSTRUCTION SITE,

15:16.316 --> 15:18.488
AND THEY THINK
THAT I KILLED HIM.

15:18.488 --> 15:21.391
YEAH. EVERYONE'S GUILTY
UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT.

15:21.391 --> 15:23.453
THEY MUST HAVE SOMETHING
ON YOU.

15:23.453 --> 15:25.425
WELL, THEY DID RECEIVE
A LETTER FROM MY EX-HUSBAND

15:25.425 --> 15:27.197
SAYING I DID IT.

15:27.197 --> 15:28.528
WELL, THAT'S NOTHING.

15:28.528 --> 15:30.300
THE GUY'S GOT A VENDETTA
AGAINST YOU, RIGHT?

15:30.300 --> 15:31.931
YES, HE DOES.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.303
UH, AND THEN THERE'S

15:33.303 --> 15:35.405
A SLIGHTLY MORE DAMNING
PHONE CONVERSATION

15:35.405 --> 15:37.337
IN WHICH I EXPRESSED REMORSE

15:37.337 --> 15:40.510
FOR, UM, PUTTING A BODY
IN THE GROUND.

15:40.510 --> 15:42.342
BIG DEAL.

15:42.342 --> 15:45.445
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT
BURYING A DEAD PET.

15:45.445 --> 15:48.078
I SUPPOSE I WAS.

15:48.078 --> 15:50.420
AND THEN... (clears throat)
THE POLICE CLAIM TO HAVE FOUND

15:50.420 --> 15:53.183
ONE OF MY FINGERPRINTS
ON THE DEAD MAN'S SHIRT.

15:53.183 --> 15:54.484
HMM.

15:54.484 --> 15:57.427
THAT'S BAD, RIGHT?

15:58.428 --> 16:00.530
ACTUALLY...

16:00.530 --> 16:02.532
I THINK THAT IT'S NOBLE--

16:02.532 --> 16:05.996
NOBLE THAT YOU DONATE SO MUCH
OF YOUR CLOTHING TO GOODWILL...
 (thud)

16:05.996 --> 16:10.570
AND A SHAME THAT THAT POOR SAP
ENDED UP WITH YOUR SHIRT.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.272
(gasps)

16:12.272 --> 16:13.403
BOB WAS WRONG.

16:13.403 --> 16:16.076
YOU'RE NOT GOOD.
YOU'RE AMAZING.

16:16.076 --> 16:17.547
SO YOU'LL TAKE MY CASE?

16:17.547 --> 16:19.449
NOPE.

16:19.449 --> 16:21.411
"NOPE"?

16:21.411 --> 16:24.714
NO OFFENSE, BUT, UM,
IT'S KIND OF A SNOOZE.

16:24.714 --> 16:27.117
EXCUSE ME, BUT I HAVE BEEN
ACCUSED OF MURDER.

16:27.117 --> 16:28.488
MY LIFE IS ON THE LINE HERE.

16:28.488 --> 16:31.421
OH, PLEASE. WHAT JURY IS
GONNA CONVICT YOU,

16:31.421 --> 16:34.394
WITH YOUR--YOUR PEARLS
AND YOUR PERFECT HAIR

16:34.394 --> 16:37.367
AND YOUR SUBTLE SCENT
OF LAVENDER?

16:37.367 --> 16:38.698
WELL, I WOULD THINK
THAT A LAWYER

16:38.698 --> 16:41.101
WOULD ENJOY DEFENDING
AN INNOCENT CLIENT.

16:41.101 --> 16:42.132
YOU WOULD THINK SO,
WOULDN'T YOU?

16:42.132 --> 16:44.404
BUT I LOVE A CHALLENGE.

16:44.404 --> 16:47.477
LAST YEAR, I DEFENDED A GUY
WHO WAS FOUND STANDING

16:47.477 --> 16:50.440
OVER HIS DEAD FATHER
WITH A BLOODY KNIFE IN HIS HAND.

16:50.440 --> 16:53.743
NOT ONLY DID I EXONERATE
HIS GUILTY ASS,

16:53.743 --> 16:57.187
(chuckles) I GOT HIM
50% OF THE ESTATE.

16:57.187 --> 16:59.489
THAT IS REPREHENSIBLE.

16:59.489 --> 17:00.720
THANK YOU.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.522
(sighs)

17:02.522 --> 17:04.223
I'M SORRY, MS. VAN DE KAMP,

17:04.223 --> 17:06.626
BUT THIS IS JUST--
IT'S TOO EASY.

17:06.626 --> 17:10.630
I MEAN, PEOPLE WHO ARE FAMOUS
FOR THEIR MUFFINS--

17:10.630 --> 17:12.502
NOT GENERALLY KILLERS.

17:16.435 --> 17:18.208
(clears throat)

17:24.544 --> 17:27.547
(cash register beeping
and whirring)

17:38.688 --> 17:40.130
GOOD MORNING.

17:40.130 --> 17:41.661
MY NAME'S GABRIELLE.

17:41.661 --> 17:44.264
I'M A PERSONAL SHOPPER HERE.
CAN I HELP YOU?

17:44.264 --> 17:47.667
NO, NO, NO. I'M JUST TRYING
TO FIND THE MEN'S DEPARTMENT.

17:47.667 --> 17:49.269
I NEED SOME SOCKS.

17:49.269 --> 17:52.672
OH, I CAN HELP YOU WITH THAT.
MAY I?

17:56.606 --> 17:58.448
OH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

17:58.448 --> 18:01.281
THESE ANKLES DESERVE...
(whispers) SO MUCH BETTER.

18:01.281 --> 18:02.512
YOU THINK?

18:02.512 --> 18:04.854
I-I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT
THEY WERE JUST AVERAGE ANKLES.

18:04.854 --> 18:08.458
AVERAGE? THEY'RE EXQUISITE.

18:08.458 --> 18:09.589
OOH!

18:09.589 --> 18:11.521
DO YOU WORK OUT?

18:11.521 --> 18:15.094
I DO
A LITTLE MALL WALKING, YES.

18:16.426 --> 18:20.370
WELL, I DON'T SAY THIS
TO EVERY MAN,

18:20.370 --> 18:24.234
BUT YOU'VE GOT THE PERFECT
ANKLES FOR CASHMERE.

18:24.234 --> 18:26.436
LET ME SHOW YOU A FEW PAIRS.

18:30.340 --> 18:32.282
40 BUCKS FOR SOCKS?

18:32.282 --> 18:35.885
I KNOW. THERE'S JUST SOMETHING
IRRESISTIBLE ABOUT CASHMERE.

18:35.885 --> 18:38.248
PROMISE ME YOU WON'T BUY
ONE OF THESE CASHMERE SWEATERS.

18:38.248 --> 18:40.520
I WOULDN'T BE ABLE
TO KEEP MY HANDS OFF YOU.

18:40.520 --> 18:41.691
WELL...

18:43.493 --> 18:46.156
I REALLY JUST NEED THE TIE.

18:46.156 --> 18:48.158
HOW CAN YOU TAKE THE TIE
WITHOUT THE BLAZER?

18:48.158 --> 18:49.659
WITH YOUR SHOULDERS?

18:49.659 --> 18:54.234
AND THIS COLOR UP AGAINST
THAT BEAUTIFUL SILVER HAIR...

18:54.234 --> 18:58.468
I'M SORRY. I LOST MYSELF THERE
FOR A MOMENT.

18:58.468 --> 19:01.311
OOH! HELLO, GEORGE CLOONEY!

19:01.311 --> 19:03.473
IT'S JUST SO EXPENSIVE.
I DON'T KNOW.

19:03.473 --> 19:04.614
YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:04.614 --> 19:08.718
MAYBE I SHOULD MEASURE
THAT INSEAM ONE MORE TIME.

19:10.580 --> 19:13.253
WHAT IF IT WAS DRUGS?

19:13.253 --> 19:16.756
SERIOUSLY?
I JUST FELL ASLEEP.

19:16.756 --> 19:19.859
OH. THIS BABY'S BEEN WORKING
ON HER BLACK BELT.

19:19.859 --> 19:22.592
I'M JUST SAYING,
MIKE HAD A DRUG PROBLEM.

19:22.592 --> 19:24.594
THOSE THINGS NEVER GO AWAY.

19:24.594 --> 19:26.736
I'M SURE IT WAS
NOTHING LIKE THAT.

19:26.736 --> 19:28.738
YOU'RE RIGHT.

19:28.738 --> 19:30.740
(sighs)

19:30.740 --> 19:32.902
IT'S PROBABLY PORN.

19:32.902 --> 19:36.406
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M COOL WITH THAT.

19:36.406 --> 19:39.679
AS LONG
AS IT WAS NOTHING WEIRD.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.911
OH, GOD. YOU THINK
IT WAS SOMETHING WEIRD?

19:41.911 --> 19:43.283
STOP.

19:43.283 --> 19:45.285
JUST TRUST LEE.

19:45.285 --> 19:48.718
IF HE THINKS YOU SHOULDN'T
SEE IN THE BOX,

19:48.718 --> 19:50.360
WELL, YOU DON'T WANT
TO FIND SOMETHING

19:50.360 --> 19:52.592
THAT WOULD TARNISH
YOUR MEMORIES OF MIKE.

19:54.794 --> 19:58.468
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

19:58.468 --> 19:59.929
I SHOULD JUST LEAVE
THIS ALONE.

19:59.929 --> 20:01.631
(knock on door)

20:03.473 --> 20:04.804
SUSAN, IT'S--

20:04.804 --> 20:06.836
2:00 IN THE MORNING. I KNOW.
BUT I CAN'T SLEEP,

20:06.836 --> 20:09.709
AND I AM NEVER GONNA SLEEP UNTIL
I KNOW WHAT'S INSIDE THAT BOX.

20:09.709 --> 20:12.342
SO YOU CAN EITHER LET ME IN NOW
OR WE CAN DO THIS AGAIN AT 3:00

20:12.342 --> 20:15.345
AND THEN AT 4:00
AND THEN AT--THANK YOU.

20:17.687 --> 20:20.690
SO THERE'S HIS PASSPORT,
LETTERS FROM HIS MOM,

20:20.690 --> 20:22.722
A REALLY CUTE PICTURE
OF YOU AND M.J.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.524
JUST GET TO IT.

20:24.524 --> 20:26.826
AND A CHECKBOOK.

20:26.826 --> 20:30.800
APPARENTLY, HE SET UP AN ACCOUNT
EIGHT YEARS AGO.

20:30.800 --> 20:32.832
THAT'S
WHEN WE WERE DIVORCED.

20:32.832 --> 20:34.834
AND EVERY MONTH SINCE,
HE'S WRITTEN A CHECK

20:34.834 --> 20:37.337
TO SOME WOMAN NAMED
JENNIE HERNANDEZ.

20:40.370 --> 20:42.542
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF HER.

20:42.542 --> 20:44.814
THIS IS HER ADDRESS.

20:44.814 --> 20:47.817
SOMEWHERE IN MOUNT PLEASANT.

20:56.926 --> 20:58.958
OH, MY GOD.

20:58.958 --> 21:00.690
ANY CHANCE THOSE ARE M.J.'s?

21:00.690 --> 21:02.492
NO.

21:02.492 --> 21:04.434
WELL, MAYBE IT'S--

21:04.434 --> 21:08.538
WE BOTH KNOW WHAT IT IS.

21:08.538 --> 21:10.269
THERE'S A CHILD OUT THERE.

21:11.701 --> 21:14.844
MIKE'S CHILD.

21:22.512 --> 21:24.414
77, 78, 79, 80.

21:24.414 --> 21:25.855
HI, LYNETTE.

21:25.855 --> 21:28.287
81, 82, 83...

21:28.287 --> 21:29.389
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

21:29.389 --> 21:31.961
84, 85. MAKING TOM A CAKE.
86, 87...

21:31.961 --> 21:36.426
GOSH, HOW OLD IS HE GONNA BE?
46? 47? 48?
 92, 93, 94, 95...

21:36.426 --> 21:38.598
I MADE DINNER RESERVATIONS
AT 7:15.

21:38.598 --> 21:40.500
OR WAS IT 7:16? 7:17?

21:40.500 --> 21:44.504
NICE TRY, BUT I AM LIKE
RAIN MAN. 98, 99, 100.

21:44.504 --> 21:45.805
SORRY TO BOTHER YOU.

21:45.805 --> 21:47.837
PENNY AND PARKER LEFT THIS STUFF
OVER AT OUR PLACE,

21:47.837 --> 21:49.539
SO I THOUGHT I'D DROP IT BY.

21:49.539 --> 21:51.781
THANKS. I SEE
THEY'RE MAKING LAB COATS

21:51.781 --> 21:53.713
A LOT TIGHTER
THAN THEY USED TO.

21:53.713 --> 21:55.915
(chuckles) I SEE
THEY'RE MAKING SWEATPANTS

21:55.915 --> 21:58.047
JUST AS BAGGY AS ALWAYS.

21:58.047 --> 21:59.549
(chuckles)

21:59.549 --> 22:00.920
(chuckles) BESIDES,
I'M NOT GOING TO WORK.

22:00.920 --> 22:02.822
I'M TAKING TOM
TO HIS FAVORITE RESTAURANT,

22:02.822 --> 22:06.626
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
IT'S HIS BIRTHDAY.

22:06.626 --> 22:08.528
YEAH, I KNOW.

22:08.528 --> 22:11.601
THAT'S WHY I'M MAKING HIM
HIS FAVORITE CAKE.

22:11.601 --> 22:13.403
LOOKS APPETIZING.

22:13.403 --> 22:15.435
DON'T FORGET TO ADD
THE EYE OF NEWT.

22:15.435 --> 22:17.907
OH, 'CAUSE IT'S GREEN?
IT'S A FUNNY STORY.

22:17.907 --> 22:19.569
WHEN TOM AND I WERE
FIRST DATING,

22:19.569 --> 22:22.341
HE WANTED A RED VELVET CAKE
FOR HIS BIRTHDAY,

22:22.341 --> 22:24.544
BUT I ONLY HAD
GREEN FOOD COLORING,

22:24.544 --> 22:27.517
AND HE LIKED IT ANYWAY,
SO IT'S BECOME A TRADITION,

22:27.517 --> 22:32.382
ONE WE HAVE SHARED
 FOR 25 YEARS.

22:32.382 --> 22:34.684
I THINK WE'RE
GONNA KEEP SHARING IT.

22:34.684 --> 22:36.426
LYNETTE,
STOP EMBARRASSING YOURSELF.

22:36.426 --> 22:38.558
TOM IS THROUGH WITH YOU.

22:38.558 --> 22:40.630
WE HAVE A FAMILY TOGETHER.

22:40.630 --> 22:42.632
YOU DON'T JUST THROW
THAT AWAY.

22:44.564 --> 22:46.536
UNTIL YOU DO.

22:46.536 --> 22:48.498
MM-HMM. WHAT IS THAT?

22:48.498 --> 22:49.669
YOUR DIVORCE PAPERS.

22:52.502 --> 22:54.474
TOM ALREADY SIGNED THEM.

22:54.474 --> 22:55.975
NOW IT'S YOUR TURN.

22:58.508 --> 23:00.610
(gasps)

23:00.610 --> 23:03.953
WHAT THE HELL?!

23:03.953 --> 23:06.586
OH, MY GOD!

23:06.586 --> 23:09.789
(scoffs)

23:15.695 --> 23:17.897
(whistles)
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

23:17.897 --> 23:20.670
OH. YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT
'CAUSE IT'S OBVIOUS.

23:20.670 --> 23:22.071
(laughs) MWAH.

23:22.071 --> 23:24.173
I'LL BE HOME FOR DINNER.

23:25.875 --> 23:28.107
OH, BY THE WAY, THINK YOU
COULD MIX THINGS UP?

23:28.107 --> 23:30.039
GETTING A LITTLE TIRED
OF CHICKEN.

23:30.039 --> 23:31.941
YOU FORGOT SOMETHING.

23:31.941 --> 23:34.784
OH. THAT.

23:34.784 --> 23:36.145
HERE'S THE THING--

23:36.145 --> 23:38.888
IT'S BETTER FOR BUSINESS
IF I DON'T WEAR IT.

23:38.888 --> 23:39.919
REALLY?

23:39.919 --> 23:41.621
I HAVE A LOT OF RICH MEN
AS CLIENTS.

23:41.621 --> 23:43.092
IF I FLIRT WITH THEM,
THEY BUY MORE STUFF,

23:43.092 --> 23:45.054
WHICH MEANS I MAKE MORE MONEY,

23:45.054 --> 23:48.458
AND YOU CAN COOK SOMETHING
OTHER THAN CHICKEN FOR DINNER.

23:48.458 --> 23:50.700
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M NOT COMFORTABLE

23:50.700 --> 23:53.633
WITH YOU DRESSING LIKE THAT
AND FLIRTING WITH THOSE GUYS.

23:53.633 --> 23:55.735
OH, HONEY, YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

23:55.735 --> 23:57.767
THEY'RE JUST A BUNCH OF NERDS
WITH MONEY.

23:57.767 --> 23:59.469
THIS JUST HELPS.

23:59.469 --> 24:01.741
YOU CAN'T DRESS FOR CHURCH
IF YOU WANT TO MOVE THE MERCH.

24:01.741 --> 24:03.142
GABY...

24:03.142 --> 24:05.044
YOU GOTTA SHAKE YOUR REAR
TO GET THEM TO BUY THE GEAR.

24:05.044 --> 24:07.617
GABY...
 YOU WANNA SELL SOME KNITS,
YOU BETTER FLASH YOUR--

24:07.617 --> 24:09.819
GABY! I GOT IT.

24:09.819 --> 24:12.882
TOO BAD.
I HAVE, LIKE, 15 MORE.

24:12.882 --> 24:14.524
(kiss)
 SEE YOU TONIGHT.

24:17.186 --> 24:18.658
(sighs deeply)

24:18.658 --> 24:21.661
(indistinct conversations,
piano playing)

24:27.937 --> 24:29.599
LYNETTE?

24:29.599 --> 24:31.000
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

24:31.000 --> 24:33.703
LOOK, JANE'S MEETING ME
FOR MY BIRTHDAY.

24:33.703 --> 24:34.844
UH, JANE'S RUNNING LATE.

24:34.844 --> 24:39.048
SHE HAD A LITTLE TROUBLE
WITH YOUR CAKE.

24:39.048 --> 24:40.179
YOU SIGNED THIS?

24:40.179 --> 24:42.712
HOW DID YOU GET THESE?

24:42.712 --> 24:47.186
THEY WERE HANDED TO ME
PERSONALLY BY YOUR NEW ROOMMATE.

24:47.186 --> 24:48.718
ANSWER THE QUESTION.

24:48.718 --> 24:51.721
I DID NOT ASK JANE TO BRING
THESE TO YOU, I SWEAR.

24:51.721 --> 24:54.624
IT DOESN'T MATTER
IF JANE BROUGHT THEM.

24:54.624 --> 24:57.266
HE'S GONNA NEED
A FEW MORE MINUTES.

24:57.266 --> 25:00.069
LOOK, I'M--I'M--I'M--I'M TAKEN
A-A LITTLE OFF GUARD HERE.

25:00.069 --> 25:01.771
CAN WE TALK
ABOUT THIS LATER?

25:01.771 --> 25:04.003
THIS IS YOUR SIGNATURE,
ISN'T IT?

25:04.003 --> 25:05.034
YES.

25:05.034 --> 25:06.576
WHEN DID YOU SIGN IT?

25:07.937 --> 25:10.540
I DON'T KNOW.
A WHILE AGO, I GUESS. I--

25:10.540 --> 25:12.141
YOU GUESS? JEEZ.
THIS ISN'T A GYM MEMBERSHIP.

25:12.141 --> 25:14.814
THIS IS FOR THE DISSOLUTION
OF OUR MARRIAGE.

25:14.814 --> 25:16.616
LOOK, I KNOW.

25:16.616 --> 25:18.247
(lowers voice)
YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW?

25:19.889 --> 25:21.921
THIS IS HARD FOR ME, TOO,
OKAY?

25:24.123 --> 25:25.825
BUT YOU GOTTA BELIEVE ME.

25:25.825 --> 25:28.658
THERE IS NO WAY I MEANT FOR JANE
TO BRING THIS TO YOU.

25:28.658 --> 25:32.732
THEN JUST TELL ME,
WHAT IS IT YOU DO MEAN?

25:37.236 --> 25:40.139
DO YOU WANT
TO END OUR MARRIAGE?

25:52.822 --> 25:54.724
(sighs)

26:00.760 --> 26:02.592
(sets pen down)

26:11.140 --> 26:12.802
(sighs)

26:12.802 --> 26:14.744
(horn honks, tires screech)

26:14.744 --> 26:16.976
SORRY.

26:16.976 --> 26:19.208
(shifts gears)
 SORRY.

26:19.208 --> 26:20.710
I'M SORRY.

26:20.710 --> 26:22.852
(crying) I'M SORRY.

26:22.852 --> 26:26.786
I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.

26:26.786 --> 26:30.159
I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY. I'M S--

26:47.076 --> 26:49.679
PLEASE TALK TO ME.

26:51.741 --> 26:53.142
YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST
THAT YOU'VE HAD

26:53.142 --> 26:55.114
SO MUCH GOING ON LATELY,

26:55.114 --> 26:57.947
I-I-I, YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT--
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE HELPFUL

26:57.947 --> 27:00.249
IF I TOOK THE PAPERS OVER
FOR YOU.
 (jacket rustles)

27:00.249 --> 27:02.952
ON WHAT PLANET IS

27:02.952 --> 27:08.027
YOU SERVING MY WIFE
DIVORCE PAPERS A GOOD IDEA?

27:08.027 --> 27:10.159
I THOUGHT I WAS
DOING YOU A FAVOR.

27:10.159 --> 27:12.231
ME A FAVOR?

27:12.231 --> 27:14.664
REALLY? ME?!

27:14.664 --> 27:16.235
FINE. US!

27:16.235 --> 27:18.868
I JUST WANT US
TO MOVE FORWARD.

27:18.868 --> 27:21.010
I CAN'T STAND THIS "ONE FOOT IN,
ONE FOOT OUT" THING

27:21.010 --> 27:22.942
THAT YOU'VE GOT GOING
WITH YOUR EX.

27:22.942 --> 27:24.213
IT'S NOT WHAT
I SIGNED UP FOR.

27:24.213 --> 27:27.176
I TOLD YOU
I WOULD TAKE CARE OF IT.

27:27.176 --> 27:29.819
NOW IS NOT THE TIME.

27:29.819 --> 27:32.351
IT'S NEVER THE TIME, TOM,
UNTIL YOU MAKE IT THE TIME.

27:32.351 --> 27:34.784
YOU DON'T JUST TH-THROW PAPERS
AT SOMEONE

27:34.784 --> 27:36.255
AND SAY, "HERE. SIGN THIS.

27:36.255 --> 27:39.228
EVERYTHING THAT WE HAVE KNOWN
AND WORKED FOR IS OVER."

27:39.228 --> 27:41.260
IT'S NOT THAT EASY.

27:41.260 --> 27:44.133
IT IS WHEN YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU WANT.

27:46.195 --> 27:48.898
(crying) TOM...

27:48.898 --> 27:50.399
I LOVE YOU.

27:50.399 --> 27:52.071
BUT IF WE'RE GONNA
BE TOGETHER,

27:52.071 --> 27:53.873
YOU'VE GOT TO STOP
THINKING ABOUT HER NEEDS

27:53.873 --> 27:56.746
AND START THINKING
ABOUT MINE.

27:56.746 --> 28:00.349
I AM ALWAYS GONNA CARE
ABOUT LYNETTE.

28:02.712 --> 28:06.986
SHE'S THE MOTHER
OF MY CHILDREN.

28:09.458 --> 28:13.863
SO YOU NEED TO DECIDE
WHETHER YOU CAN LIVE WITH THAT.

28:23.132 --> 28:26.035
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

28:34.113 --> 28:35.915
HI. I'M LOOKING FOR JENNIE.

28:35.915 --> 28:37.987
I'M JENNIE. AND YOU ARE?

28:37.987 --> 28:41.150
SUSAN DELFINO, MIKE'S WIFE.

28:41.150 --> 28:43.122
OH.

28:43.122 --> 28:44.223
YEAH.

28:44.223 --> 28:47.196
I'M SO SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

28:47.196 --> 28:50.099
THANK YOU FOR YOUR SYMPATHY,

28:50.099 --> 28:54.163
BUT WHAT I REALLY NEED FROM YOU
IS AN EXPLANATION.

28:54.163 --> 28:56.766
WHY WAS MIKE SENDING YOU
CHECKS EVERY MONTH?

28:56.766 --> 28:59.138
THEY WEREN'T FOR ME.
THEY'RE FOR LAURA.

28:59.138 --> 29:02.772
OKAY. (sighs)

29:02.772 --> 29:04.743
WHO'S LAURA? MIKE'S DAUGHTER?

29:04.743 --> 29:06.245
NO. HIS SISTER.

29:13.122 --> 29:15.324
SO... THIS IS A GROUP HOME?

29:15.324 --> 29:16.956
FOR AUTISTIC ADULTS.

29:16.956 --> 29:18.988
LAURA'S ONE
OF OUR MORE SEVERE CASES.

29:18.988 --> 29:20.089
SHE CAN'T SPEAK.

29:20.089 --> 29:22.291
LOVES PAINTING THOUGH.

29:22.291 --> 29:24.934
SPENDS HOURS EVERY DAY
AT THAT TABLE.

29:24.934 --> 29:27.396
DID MIKE EVER MENTION
HAVING A SISTER?

29:27.396 --> 29:29.068
NO. NEVER.

29:29.068 --> 29:30.769
HE WAS GREAT WITH HER.

29:30.769 --> 29:32.771
HE CAME BY EVERY MONDAY NIGHT
TO VISIT.

29:32.771 --> 29:35.274
TOLD ME HE HAD SOFTBALL.

29:35.274 --> 29:38.107
(telephone rings)
 EXCUSE ME A MOMENT.

29:38.107 --> 29:40.379
THIS IS CRAZY.

29:40.379 --> 29:42.051
NO. THIS IS GOOD.

29:42.051 --> 29:43.913
THERE'S NO OTHER WOMAN,
NO KID.

29:43.913 --> 29:46.986
WHY WOULDN'T MIKE TELL ME
HE HAD A SISTER?

29:46.986 --> 29:49.118
I DON'T KNOW.

29:49.118 --> 29:50.519
DID HE THINK I'D BE UPSET
ABOUT THE MONEY?

29:50.519 --> 29:52.121
BECAUSE I WOULDN'T.

29:52.121 --> 29:53.292
I'M SURE HE KNEW THAT.

29:53.292 --> 29:57.166
BUT WHY DID HE THINK HE HAD
TO HIDE THIS FROM ME?

29:57.166 --> 29:59.168
I MEAN, DID HE THINK
I WAS THE KIND OF PERSON

29:59.168 --> 30:00.569
THAT WOULDN'T ACCEPT HER?

30:00.569 --> 30:02.401
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

30:02.401 --> 30:04.073
WOULD YOU LIKE TO MEET LAURA?

30:04.073 --> 30:06.335
WE'D LOVE TO.

30:17.216 --> 30:20.219
HIS NAME IS, UH,
RAMON SANCHEZ.

30:20.219 --> 30:22.391
HE WOULD'VE STAYED HERE
AROUND, UH, SIX MONTHS AGO.

30:22.391 --> 30:23.452
MM-HMM.

30:23.452 --> 30:26.155
HMM. DOESN'T RING A BELL.

30:26.155 --> 30:28.958
BUT HE COULD BE
IN MY TREASURE CHEST.

30:28.958 --> 30:32.131
I KEEP ALL THE ITEMS
GUESTS LEAVE BEHIND.

30:32.131 --> 30:35.204
MY HUSBAND CALLS IT HOARDING.

30:35.204 --> 30:38.267
BUT I FANCY MYSELF
MORE OF A COLLECTOR.

30:38.267 --> 30:39.608
(chuckles)

30:41.370 --> 30:45.174
20 BUCKS SAYS WE'RE BARKING UP
THE WRONG CRAZY HERE.

30:45.174 --> 30:46.876
IF THE PROSECUTOR
NEEDS MORE CONNECTION

30:46.876 --> 30:49.618
TO THAT VAN DE KAMP BROAD.
TRUST ME. I'LL FIND IT.

30:49.618 --> 30:51.550
MUST BE YOUR LUCKY DAY.

30:51.550 --> 30:54.353
ROOM 208. RAMON SANCHEZ.

30:54.353 --> 30:55.254
THANK YOU.

30:55.254 --> 30:59.058
MAGAZINE WITH A MAP,
SOME RECEIPTS.

30:59.058 --> 31:00.859
I DON'T THINK
THERE'S ANYTHING HERE.

31:03.392 --> 31:05.364
HE CIRCLED WISTERIA LANE.

31:05.364 --> 31:07.997
SO WHAT? IT DOESN'T CONNECT HIM
TO HER. NOT DIRECTLY.

31:17.977 --> 31:21.180
IT DOES IF HE WAS GOING
TO HER ADDRESS.

31:38.467 --> 31:40.599
BOB SHOULD BE HERE ANY MINUTE.

31:40.599 --> 31:43.102
YOU REALLY DON'T NEED
YOUR LAWYER.

31:43.102 --> 31:46.035
I JUST WANTED TO SHOW YOU
SOMETHING THAT WE FOUND.

31:46.035 --> 31:47.406
WHAT IS IT?

31:47.406 --> 31:50.509
IT WAS WITH SOME
OF MR. SANCHEZ'S THINGS.

31:50.509 --> 31:53.042
AS YOU CAN SEE,
HE WROTE YOUR ADDRESS ON IT.

31:53.042 --> 31:55.985
BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.
WHY WOULD HE--

31:55.985 --> 31:57.916
LOOK, IF THIS GOES
TOO MUCH FARTHER,

31:57.916 --> 31:59.448
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO
TO HELP YOU.

31:59.448 --> 32:01.020
BUT IF YOU COME FORWARD NOW,

32:01.020 --> 32:03.222
TELL ME EVERYTHING
THAT HAPPENED,

32:03.222 --> 32:05.394
THINGS WILL GO A LOT EASIER
FOR YOU.

32:08.127 --> 32:10.399
I THINK I SHOULD WAIT
FOR MY LAWYER.

32:11.600 --> 32:13.302
(clears throat)
IS THERE SOMEPLACE

32:13.302 --> 32:14.433
I COULD GET SOME WATER?

32:14.433 --> 32:16.365
RIGHT OUTSIDE.

32:23.712 --> 32:29.478
MR. CONKLIN'S PAROLE HEARING
IS TOMORROW AT... 10:00.

32:29.478 --> 32:30.579
DO YOU REALLY WANT ME
TELLING THE BOARD

32:30.579 --> 32:32.251
THAT YOU COULDN'T FIND

32:32.251 --> 32:34.483
THE DOCUMENTS
THAT I REQUESTED A WEEK AGO?

32:34.483 --> 32:36.025
I-I'LL CHECK AGAIN,
MR. WESTON.

32:36.025 --> 32:38.657
DON'T CHECK. FIND.

32:41.490 --> 32:44.463
(swallows)

32:44.463 --> 32:46.535
(exhales deeply)

32:54.203 --> 32:58.377
MS. VAN DE KAMP.

32:58.377 --> 33:00.279
YOU OKAY?

33:00.279 --> 33:01.980
I THINK SO.

33:01.980 --> 33:05.384
JUST, UH, WAITING FOR BOB.

33:05.384 --> 33:07.056
THEY FOUND SOME
OTHER EVIDENCE,

33:07.056 --> 33:09.018
AND I'M JUST NOT SURE
WHAT TO MAKE OF IT ALL.

33:16.525 --> 33:18.267
LOOK, UH,

33:18.267 --> 33:20.569
I'M TRYING
TO HELP YOU OUT HERE.

33:20.569 --> 33:22.431
BUT THERE IS A CLOCK
ON THIS DEAL,

33:22.431 --> 33:24.533
SO I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH LONGER
YOU WANNA WAIT FOR YOUR LAWYER.

33:24.533 --> 33:27.606
YOU MUST HATE
BEING A DETECTIVE, HUH?

33:27.606 --> 33:29.138
MR. WESTON.

33:29.138 --> 33:31.540
EVEN A ROOKIE COP KNOWS
THAT INTERROGATING A SUSPECT

33:31.540 --> 33:34.583
WITHOUT COUNSEL PRESENT IS
A VIOLATION OF THEIR RIGHTS,

33:34.583 --> 33:38.747
SO THIS MUST BE YOUR WAY OF
TRYING TO LOSE YOUR GOLD SHIELD,

33:38.747 --> 33:41.420
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK IT'S GONNA WORK.

33:41.420 --> 33:43.552
WE'RE JUST MAKING SMALL TALK,
WAITING FOR HER LAWYER.

33:43.552 --> 33:45.794
WELL, SMALL TALK'S OVER.

33:45.794 --> 33:48.297
I'M HER LAWYER.

33:48.297 --> 33:49.598
LET'S GO.

33:51.029 --> 33:53.232
YOU DON'T NEED HIS PERMISSION.

33:53.232 --> 33:55.664
YOU WANNA TALK TO HER,
YOU TALK TO ME FIRST.

33:55.664 --> 33:58.567
IS THAT CLEAR,
SOON-TO-BE-A-PATROLMAN MURPHY?

33:58.567 --> 34:00.439
GOOD EVENING, DETECTIVE.

34:08.246 --> 34:10.619
I THOUGHT MY CASE WAS
TOO BORING FOR YOU.

34:10.619 --> 34:15.083
IT WAS, BUT I REALIZED SOMETHING
THAT MADE IT INTERESTING.

34:15.083 --> 34:17.525
YOU MAY NOT HAVE DONE THIS,

34:17.525 --> 34:20.329
BUT YOU SURE AS HELL KNOW
WHO DID.

34:26.264 --> 34:28.536
(indistinct conversations)

34:28.536 --> 34:31.199
THANK YOU. OOH. WINE LIST.
I'LL TAKE THAT.

34:31.199 --> 34:32.471
AND BE SURE TO BRING ME
 THE CHECK.

34:32.471 --> 34:35.643
TONIGHT'S MY TREAT.

34:35.643 --> 34:37.106
WHOA. KINDA PRICEY.

34:37.106 --> 34:39.248
I THOUGHT WE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE
SAVING FOR BREE'S LAWYER.

34:39.248 --> 34:41.610
WE ARE, BUT I'M STARTING
TO DO REALLY WELL,

34:41.610 --> 34:43.752
SO I THINK WE CAN AFFORD
ONE SPLURGE.

34:43.752 --> 34:45.583
I DON'T KNOW.

34:45.583 --> 34:48.117
OH, COME ON, CARLOS.
I WANT TO DO THIS FOR YOU.

34:48.117 --> 34:49.818
CAN'T YOU JUST ENJOY IT?

34:49.818 --> 34:53.422
(sighs)
I GUESS I CAN DO THAT.

34:53.422 --> 34:54.563
(man) GABY?
 JASON!

34:54.563 --> 34:56.165
HEY! I THOUGHT THAT WAS YOU.

34:56.165 --> 34:57.396
WOW!

34:57.396 --> 34:58.567
HI! (laughs)

34:58.567 --> 34:59.628
OH!

34:59.628 --> 35:00.829
WHOA!

35:02.201 --> 35:03.372
WHO ARE YOU?

35:03.372 --> 35:06.605
OH, THIS IS JASON,
ONE OF MY CLIENTS.

35:06.605 --> 35:09.338
JASON, THIS IS CARLOS, MY...

35:09.338 --> 35:10.379
BROTHER.

35:10.379 --> 35:11.610
(chuckles)

35:11.610 --> 35:12.741
OH, HEY, MAN.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

35:16.185 --> 35:18.317
GRAB A CHAIR. JOIN US.
(chuckles)

35:18.317 --> 35:19.748
THANKS.

35:20.849 --> 35:22.621
SO, UH,

35:22.621 --> 35:25.654
YOUR SISTER HERE IS
QUITE THE LITTLE SALESWOMAN.

35:25.654 --> 35:27.596
YOU BELIEVE SHE TALKED ME
INTO A $4,000 SUIT TODAY?

35:27.596 --> 35:28.657
I MEAN... (scoffs)

35:28.657 --> 35:32.501
THAT IS SO... SIS.

35:32.501 --> 35:36.405
CARLOS, MAYBE YOU SHOULD GO TO
THE BAR AND GET US SOME DRINKS.

35:36.405 --> 35:39.338
NAH. I'M NOT THIRSTY.

35:39.338 --> 35:41.840
SO, UH, I'M WEARING ONE
OF THE SHIRTS YOU PICKED OUT.

35:41.840 --> 35:43.472
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

35:43.472 --> 35:46.245
OH. I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT
I THINK IN FRONT OF MY BROTHER.

35:46.245 --> 35:48.477
(laughs)
 YOU'RE SO FUNNY.

35:48.477 --> 35:49.618
HEY, CARLOS,
HOW IS IT POSSIBLE

35:49.618 --> 35:52.721
THAT SOMEONE AS AWESOME
AS YOUR SISTER

35:52.721 --> 35:54.453
HASN'T BEEN SCOOPED UP
ALREADY?

35:54.453 --> 35:55.454
(laughs)

35:55.454 --> 35:57.856
MY GUESS IS IT'S THE HERPES.

36:00.229 --> 36:02.591
(chuckles) SIBLING HUMOR.

36:02.591 --> 36:05.194
YOU'RE RIGHT. ALL THOSE TRIPS
TO THE FREE CLINIC

36:05.194 --> 36:07.436
COULD'VE BEEN FOR ANYTHING.

36:07.436 --> 36:08.697
SERIOUSLY, CARLOS,

36:08.697 --> 36:10.469
SOME DRINKS FOR THE TABLE
WOULD BE REALLY GOOD.

36:10.469 --> 36:11.700
YOU KNOW, WHAT THE HELL?

36:11.700 --> 36:13.502
I'LL TAKE
A SCOTCH ON THE ROCKS.

36:13.502 --> 36:15.173
UH, A SINGLE MALT.

36:15.173 --> 36:18.577
ACTUALLY, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
GET THAT ONE YOURSELF.

36:18.577 --> 36:21.380
I AM GOING HOME TO MY WIFE.

36:21.380 --> 36:22.651
I'M MARRIED.

36:30.188 --> 36:31.590
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU JUST DID THAT.

36:31.590 --> 36:33.522
THAT GUY'S
ONE OF MY BEST CUSTOMERS.

36:33.522 --> 36:35.594
OH, ARE WE TALKING ABOUT
THAT "NERD" YOU SELL TO?

36:35.594 --> 36:37.596
OKAY, MAYBE HE'S A LITTLE
BETTER-LOOKING THAN THE OTHERS,

36:37.596 --> 36:39.568
BUT IT'S MY JOB, CARLOS.

36:39.568 --> 36:41.630
FINE. WHATEVER.
LET'S JUST GET OUT OF HERE.

36:41.630 --> 36:43.532
YOU ARE SUCH A HYPOCRITE.

36:43.532 --> 36:45.634
HOW MANY TIMES DID YOU TELL ME
TO SHOW A LITTLE CLEAVAGE

36:45.634 --> 36:47.406
WHEN MEETING
YOUR OUT-OF-TOWN CLIENTS?

36:47.406 --> 36:50.379
MY BREASTS WERE PRACTICALLY
A TOURIST STOP.

36:50.379 --> 36:51.940
THIS IS DIFFERENT,

36:51.940 --> 36:53.542
AND I DON'T LIKE IT,.

36:53.542 --> 36:55.213
WELL, TOO BAD.
WE NEED THIS JOB.

36:55.213 --> 36:56.485
I'M THE BREADWINNER NOW.

36:56.485 --> 36:58.687
YEP. THROW THAT
IN MY FACE AGAIN.

36:58.687 --> 36:59.718
WHAT?

36:59.718 --> 37:02.721
"MAKE ME DINNER, CARLOS."
"GET ME DRINKS."

37:02.721 --> 37:04.393
"BRING ME THE CHECK."

37:04.393 --> 37:07.456
YEAH, CARLOS,
I DID OFFER TO TREAT.

37:07.456 --> 37:10.459
AND YOU KNOW WHAT I WAS
THINKING? HOW GOOD IT FELT,

37:10.459 --> 37:12.431
HOW FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN 19 YEARS

37:12.431 --> 37:13.702
I WAS ABLE TO TREAT YOU,

37:13.702 --> 37:15.764
AND I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT WOULD BOTHER YOU.

37:15.764 --> 37:18.637
WELL, IT DOES.

37:18.637 --> 37:20.769
IT'S DRIVING ME CRAZY
THAT YOU'RE THE ONE

37:20.769 --> 37:22.911
MAKING ALL THE MONEY
AND CALLING ALL THE SHOTS.

37:22.911 --> 37:25.574
WELL, GET USED TO IT,
BECAUSE I DID ALL THIS FOR YOU.

37:25.574 --> 37:27.316
THIS IS WHAT YOU WANTED.

37:30.379 --> 37:32.351
UH, GIVE 'EM TO HER.
SHE'S DRIVING NOW.

37:37.426 --> 37:39.658
(sighs)

37:45.594 --> 37:48.567
(Susan sighs)

37:48.567 --> 37:49.738
YOU'RE UP EARLY.

37:49.738 --> 37:52.641
I'M UP LATE.

37:52.641 --> 37:54.673
(paper rustles)
 ONCE, IN COLLEGE,

37:54.673 --> 37:57.576
I WROTE MIKE A LETTER
ABOUT HOW HORRIBLE YOU ARE.

37:57.576 --> 38:00.449
AND GOOD MORNING TO ME.

38:00.449 --> 38:02.351
WE'D JUST HAD A FIGHT
ON THE PHONE,

38:02.351 --> 38:04.953
AND I NEEDED TO PUT MY ANGER
SOMEWHERE.

38:04.953 --> 38:07.055
ANYWAY, WHEN YOU SAID

38:07.055 --> 38:08.887
THAT MIKE HAD SOME OLD LETTERS
IN THAT BOX,

38:08.887 --> 38:11.720
I WANTED TO MAKE SURE
MINE WASN'T IN IT,

38:11.720 --> 38:13.992
SO I CHECKED...

38:13.992 --> 38:16.595
AND I FOUND THESE.

38:16.595 --> 38:18.597
THEY'RE FROM
MIKE'S MOM ADELE.

38:20.669 --> 38:22.531
IT TURNS OUT YOU WEREN'T
THE ONLY ONE

38:22.531 --> 38:24.503
WHO WAS IN THE DARK
ABOUT MIKE'S SISTER.

38:24.503 --> 38:27.075
HE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW SHE EXISTED
UNTIL EIGHT YEARS AGO.

38:27.075 --> 38:29.978
WHAT? WHY?

38:29.978 --> 38:32.611
IT WAS CLEAR EARLY ON

38:32.611 --> 38:35.644
THAT LAURA WAS GOING TO HAVE
SPECIAL NEEDS.

38:35.644 --> 38:39.688
I GUESS MIKE'S PARENTS
WEREN'T UP FOR IT.

38:41.650 --> 38:46.395
"SO, YES, MICHAEL,
I AM ASHAMED OF MYSELF,

38:46.395 --> 38:48.827
"AND I LIVE WITH THAT DECISION
EVERY DAY.

38:48.827 --> 38:51.900
"BUT LIFE WITH YOUR FATHER
WAS ALWAYS HARD,

38:51.900 --> 38:55.434
"AND KEEPING LAURA WOULD HAVE
BEEN AN INCONVENIENCE

38:55.434 --> 38:58.006
THAT MIGHT HAVE DESTROYED
EVERYTHING."

39:01.770 --> 39:04.713
THIS WAS THE LAST LETTER
SHE WROTE MIKE.

39:04.713 --> 39:08.677
"AND SO NOW YOU KNOW
THE WORST SECRET OF MY LIFE,

39:08.677 --> 39:10.879
"BUT I BEG OF YOU,
LET IT REMAIN A SECRET.

39:10.879 --> 39:13.051
"YOUR BEAUTIFUL NEW FAMILY

39:13.051 --> 39:15.784
"IS ONE OF THE ONLY JOYS
I HAVE.

39:15.784 --> 39:19.388
"DON'T LET THEM KNOW THE KIND
OF PERSON I REALLY AM."

39:20.659 --> 39:23.662
MIKE WASN'T KEEPING A SECRET
FROM YOU.

39:23.662 --> 39:26.795
HE WAS KEEPING A SECRET
FOR HER.

39:29.738 --> 39:34.372
WELL, I KNOW WHAT MIKE
WOULD'VE WANTED ME TO DO.

39:34.372 --> 39:37.546
I AM GONNA KEEP WRITING
THOSE CHECKS,

39:37.546 --> 39:40.549
AND I'M GONNA KEEP LAURA
IN MY LIFE.

39:42.581 --> 39:44.813
MY GOD.

39:44.813 --> 39:48.887
ADELE HAD TO LIVE WITH THAT
ON HER CONSCIENCE.

39:51.990 --> 39:53.622
YEAH.

39:53.622 --> 39:55.123
HOW DO YOU DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

39:55.123 --> 39:57.866
HOW DO YOU GIVE AWAY
YOUR OWN CHILD

39:57.866 --> 39:59.928
JUST BECAUSE
IT'S INCONVENIENT?

39:59.928 --> 40:04.873
(crying)

40:04.873 --> 40:08.006
OH, NO, NO, NO. NO,
UM, I-I DIDN'T MEAN--

40:08.006 --> 40:09.908
IT'S--IT'S NOT LIKE THAT
WITH YOU.

40:09.908 --> 40:13.682
NO, MOM, IT IS.

40:17.015 --> 40:22.050
ALL THE STUFF I'VE SAID
ABOUT BEING PREGNANT...

40:22.050 --> 40:24.723
THAT I'M NOT READY,

40:24.723 --> 40:27.896
OR THAT I'M NOT SURE
I'D BE A GOOD MOM...

40:30.629 --> 40:32.060
IT'S ALL BULL.

40:34.162 --> 40:38.837
WHAT THIS BABY REALLY IS TO ME
IS INCONVENIENT.

40:40.839 --> 40:43.672
(sniffles)

40:43.672 --> 40:47.716
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS
ALL NIGHT.

40:50.579 --> 40:53.181
I DON'T WANT
TO MAKE A DECISION

40:53.181 --> 40:58.757
THAT I'M GOING TO BE ASHAMED OF
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

40:58.757 --> 41:00.759
I CAN'T LIVE WITH THAT.

41:03.091 --> 41:05.133
I WON'T.

41:06.865 --> 41:08.066
JULIE, ARE YOU SAYING--

41:08.066 --> 41:09.598
YEAH.

41:11.600 --> 41:13.842
I'M GONNA KEEP HER.

41:16.074 --> 41:21.810
YES, IN LIFE,
WE ALL MAKE PLANS,

41:21.810 --> 41:26.585
BUT SOMETIMES THEY DON'T
TURN OUT THE WAY WE EXPECTED.

41:27.786 --> 41:33.722
BY TRYING TO HELP OUT,
WE MAY DAMAGE A RELATIONSHIP.

41:33.722 --> 41:37.025
BY ATTEMPTING TO REACH OUT,

41:37.025 --> 41:40.929
WE MAY PUSH SOMEONE
FURTHER AWAY.

41:40.929 --> 41:44.603
BY DIGGING INTO THE PAST,

41:44.603 --> 41:48.937
WE MAY ENRICH OUR PRESENT.

41:48.937 --> 41:51.139
BUT THEN THERE ARE THOSE

41:51.139 --> 41:54.142
WHO REFUSE TO LET GO
OF THEIR PLANS,

41:54.142 --> 41:57.886
NO MATTER HOW BADLY
THEY'RE TURNING OUT.

41:57.886 --> 41:58.847
HEY.

41:58.847 --> 42:00.819
CAN I BUY YOU A BEER?

42:00.819 --> 42:02.591
I FIGURE YOU COULD USE ONE.

42:02.591 --> 42:03.822
WHY?

42:03.822 --> 42:05.794
TRIP WESTON'S TAKING
THE VAN DE KAMP CASE.

42:05.794 --> 42:08.156
THE GUY WON'T QUIT
TILL HE GETS WHAT HE WANTS.

42:08.156 --> 42:11.700
YEAH, NEITHER WILL I.

42:11.700 --> 42:13.301
SO HOW ABOUT
YOU BUY ME THAT BEER

42:13.301 --> 42:15.834
WHEN THE BITCH GOES TO JAIL?
