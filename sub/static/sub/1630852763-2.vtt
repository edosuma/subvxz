WEBVTT

00:12.471 --> 00:14.140
Where do you think you're going?

00:14.140 --> 00:15.850
Reacher!

00:15.850 --> 00:17.226
Reacher, get back here!

00:17.226 --> 00:19.603
Maybe give him some space.

00:19.687 --> 00:22.982
I don't need 250 pounds
of frontier justice

00:22.982 --> 00:24.942
tearing up this town.

00:26.444 --> 00:28.696
Follow him, make sure
he doesn't ruin our case.

00:28.696 --> 00:30.030
Why me?

00:30.114 --> 00:32.867
Outside the morgue,
he actually listened to you.

00:34.034 --> 00:35.619
And what if he doesn't now?

00:35.703 --> 00:37.413
Shoot him.

01:11.906 --> 01:14.283
We got
a stranded vehicle

01:14.283 --> 01:16.619
<i>around 80 on the eastbound side.</i>

01:25.044 --> 01:27.797
247. About ten out.

01:39.141 --> 01:40.601
Shit!

01:42.311 --> 01:44.563
The hell?
I could have hit you.

01:44.647 --> 01:46.273
I don't need a babysitter
and I don't need you

01:46.357 --> 01:47.858
screwing up my investigation.

01:47.942 --> 01:51.111
Okay, first...
this is not your investigation.

01:51.195 --> 01:53.197
Second, babysitting
some giant vagrant

01:53.197 --> 01:55.199
is hardly my dream assignment.

01:55.199 --> 01:57.409
I could be out there looking
for who killed your brother.

01:57.493 --> 01:59.495
So stand down
and let me do my job,

01:59.495 --> 02:01.413
because I'm very good at it.

02:01.497 --> 02:03.499
If you were very good at it,
you wouldn't have been trying

02:03.499 --> 02:05.918
to follow a man on foot
in a police car.

02:06.961 --> 02:08.963
I figure your plan's to go
to Hubble's house

02:08.963 --> 02:10.548
and dig your thumb into his eye
until he tells you

02:10.548 --> 02:12.299
why he confessed to a murder
he didn't commit.

02:12.383 --> 02:13.884
- Something like that.
- Yeah, well, I'm gonna be there

02:13.968 --> 02:15.135
to make sure
that doesn't happen.

02:15.219 --> 02:17.012
Now, I can either follow you
the whole way,

02:17.096 --> 02:20.391
or you can save the shoe leather
and get in the damn car.

02:29.400 --> 02:30.609
Fuck.

02:38.534 --> 02:42.538
For the record,
I'm not a vagrant, I'm a hobo.

02:44.456 --> 02:45.916
Whatever.

02:51.547 --> 02:54.466
Officer Conklin, uh,
Mr. Reacher, please come in.

02:57.761 --> 03:00.806
I'm so sorry,
Paul won't be back till late.

03:00.890 --> 03:04.393
But at least now I get a chance
to thank you, Mr. Reacher.

03:04.393 --> 03:06.562
- It's just Reacher.
- Well.

03:06.562 --> 03:07.980
Reacher.

03:07.980 --> 03:10.107
My husband told me
that you looked out for him

03:10.107 --> 03:12.818
in that awful prison.

03:12.902 --> 03:14.904
Please, have a seat.

03:18.282 --> 03:20.784
Do you, uh...
do you know where Paul is?

03:21.827 --> 03:23.913
No, not specifically.

03:23.913 --> 03:25.915
He's dealing
with that embezzlement mess.

03:25.915 --> 03:27.750
Thank God he was cleared
of all that.

03:27.750 --> 03:29.335
Can you imagine?
Paul, a criminal?

03:29.335 --> 03:31.879
Man's never
so much as jaywalked.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.756
I assume that's why you're here.
The bank stuff?

03:33.756 --> 03:35.424
No.

03:35.424 --> 03:37.259
My brother was murdered.

03:37.343 --> 03:40.012
Dear God. I...

03:40.012 --> 03:42.348
I don't know what to say.

03:42.348 --> 03:44.558
That the man they found
by the highway?

03:44.642 --> 03:46.393
He was.

03:46.477 --> 03:48.520
And he had your husband's
telephone number on him.

03:49.563 --> 03:51.148
Well, that doesn't make
any sense. Why?

03:51.148 --> 03:53.067
Well, that's what we're here
to find out.

03:53.067 --> 03:55.611
Why my dead brother had your
live husband's number on him.

03:56.654 --> 03:58.072
Well, I have no idea.

03:58.072 --> 03:59.365
Momma?

04:01.617 --> 04:03.202
Is it 8:30 already?

04:03.202 --> 04:05.412
I'm sorry, but I've got to get
these two to bed.

04:05.496 --> 04:08.874
Girls, say hi to Officer Conklin
and Mr. Reacher.

04:08.958 --> 04:10.376
- Hello, Mr. Conklin.
- Hello, Mr. Reacher.

04:10.376 --> 04:11.835
- Hello, Mr. Reacher.
- Hello, Mr. Conklin.

04:11.919 --> 04:15.047
- Mm-hmm.
- It's just... Reacher.

04:15.047 --> 04:17.716
Well, this is Lucy and Tally.

04:17.800 --> 04:20.511
- Have y'all brushed your teeth?
- Yes.

04:20.511 --> 04:22.221
All right, then get on.
I'll be up in a minute.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.474
Well, Tally's growing
like a weed.

04:25.474 --> 04:26.809
Yeah, I know.

04:26.809 --> 04:29.144
She's the one with the glasses.

04:29.228 --> 04:32.898
Can you believe she's
a year younger than Lucy?

04:32.982 --> 04:34.525
May I use your restroom?

04:34.525 --> 04:35.818
Yeah, of course.
Through the kitchen,

04:35.818 --> 04:37.403
down the hall and to the left.

05:31.832 --> 05:33.542
...something
like this happens.

05:36.587 --> 05:38.505
We've taken up enough
of your time.

05:38.589 --> 05:39.757
Have a nice evening.

05:39.757 --> 05:41.383
Roscoe.

05:44.595 --> 05:47.181
Um...
well, guess we're going.

05:47.181 --> 05:49.016
- Sorry about that.
- No.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.768
Have a good evening.
Thank you for your time,

05:50.768 --> 05:52.186
and, uh...

05:52.186 --> 05:55.064
- I'll see you.
- Yes. Good night.

06:01.070 --> 06:02.821
That was an exit.

06:02.905 --> 06:06.200
Two things. One, she said Tally
is the one in the glasses.

06:06.200 --> 06:08.202
Glasses is the main difference
between the girls.

06:08.202 --> 06:09.912
Everything else was
a matter of degree,

06:09.912 --> 06:12.039
taller, shorter,
but glasses was absolute.

06:12.039 --> 06:13.832
One wears them, one doesn't.

06:13.916 --> 06:15.125
And?

06:15.209 --> 06:16.794
Right before I was attacked
in prison,

06:16.794 --> 06:18.712
a guy pointed at me
and said, "Him."

06:18.796 --> 06:20.297
I'd taken a guy's glasses.

06:20.297 --> 06:23.008
- Why?
- 'Cause he wasn't a nice man.

06:23.092 --> 06:25.886
I still had them on
when these cons came at me.

06:25.886 --> 06:28.180
Their instructions were clearly
to find the new boys

06:28.180 --> 06:30.516
and take out the one in glasses.

06:30.516 --> 06:33.519
Hubble's had been smashed.
He was the target, not me.

06:33.519 --> 06:36.271
Hubble's on the run,
or they've already got him.

06:36.355 --> 06:37.981
Okay.

06:38.065 --> 06:39.566
You said there were two things.

06:39.650 --> 06:41.777
This is some kind of seed.

06:41.777 --> 06:44.738
Why would a banker have them
on his dress shoes?

06:44.822 --> 06:46.156
You went in his closet?

06:46.240 --> 06:48.826
No. Mud room.

06:48.826 --> 06:50.244
It's an agrimony burr.

06:50.244 --> 06:51.995
They grow on tall grass
all around here.

06:52.079 --> 06:53.914
We call them hitchhikers,
'cause they stick on you

06:53.914 --> 06:55.249
and they go for a ride.

06:57.167 --> 06:59.545
They grow
where my brother was killed?

07:07.469 --> 07:09.138
This is cogongrass.

07:09.138 --> 07:11.807
Had it on my uncle's farm.
It doesn't produce burrs.

07:11.807 --> 07:13.183
Okay.

07:13.267 --> 07:16.019
Still some reason
they were on his laces.

07:17.062 --> 07:20.440
You don't pick up hitchhikers
in bank hallways.

07:26.155 --> 07:28.323
I told Finlay the shooter was
someone who knew firearms well,

07:28.407 --> 07:30.117
but it was more than that.

07:30.117 --> 07:31.827
Killer was a skilled marksman.

07:31.827 --> 07:33.328
What makes you think that?

07:33.412 --> 07:35.205
Second victim was sprinting away
in the dark.

07:35.289 --> 07:36.498
Gun had a silencer on it,

07:36.582 --> 07:37.833
which makes even
close-range work inaccurate,

07:37.833 --> 07:39.251
but he got a kill shot.

07:42.796 --> 07:44.548
Prints are Joe's.

07:44.548 --> 07:46.008
Size 13. See the divot?

07:46.008 --> 07:47.509
Heard someone coming up
behind him.

07:47.593 --> 07:48.886
Tried to turn.
Took two in the head

07:48.886 --> 07:50.304
before he could do anything
about it.

07:54.600 --> 07:57.144
Shooter came through here.

07:57.144 --> 07:59.062
Waiting for Joe.

07:59.146 --> 08:01.440
Knew he was coming.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.447
Two days ago,
moon would have been

08:08.447 --> 08:11.116
about 26 degrees further west.

08:13.619 --> 08:15.954
This area
would have been darker.

08:17.915 --> 08:20.167
This is where he hid.

08:27.174 --> 08:29.718
He enjoyed it.

08:30.761 --> 08:32.971
Sniper shot from the tree line
would have done the job

08:33.055 --> 08:35.515
with less risk.

08:35.599 --> 08:37.559
The shooter wanted to be close.

08:37.643 --> 08:39.311
Maybe it was personal.

08:39.311 --> 08:41.813
Someone takes your life,
it's always personal.

08:50.906 --> 08:52.908
Tell me about Joe.

08:53.909 --> 08:55.911
Were you guys tight?

09:01.124 --> 09:03.126
Did he have a family?

09:03.210 --> 09:05.212
What'd he do for a living?

09:05.212 --> 09:07.214
Small talk to see
if I say something

09:07.214 --> 09:09.049
to help your investigation?

09:10.092 --> 09:11.969
I'm being nice to a guy
who just lost his brother.

09:11.969 --> 09:13.512
But, you know,
now that you brought it up,

09:13.512 --> 09:15.597
you might as well answer
my questions.

09:15.681 --> 09:17.307
when we were kids; no family;

09:17.391 --> 09:19.685
last time we spoke he was
working in Homeland Security.

09:19.685 --> 09:21.270
That's interesting.

09:21.270 --> 09:23.772
You think that this might have
been connected to his job?

09:23.772 --> 09:26.316
terrorism, drugs,

09:26.400 --> 09:27.985
guns, border crimes.

09:27.985 --> 09:30.529
- What department was your brother in?
- Don't know.

09:31.905 --> 09:33.907
We hadn't spoken in a while.

09:33.991 --> 09:35.909
Why?

09:37.327 --> 09:40.455
Time passed.

09:40.539 --> 09:43.041
- Where you going?
- To find a motel.

09:43.125 --> 09:46.003
- I'll give you a ride.
- Don't want one.

10:10.027 --> 10:12.237
Hey. Mister.

10:12.321 --> 10:14.197
Why don't you come here?
We want to talk to you.

10:14.281 --> 10:16.616
- No, you don't.
- "No, you don't."

10:16.700 --> 10:18.118
Hey, come here.

10:18.118 --> 10:20.162
We just want to talk to you.

10:20.162 --> 10:23.165
Heard you got arrested
for murder.

10:23.165 --> 10:25.959
What kind of bullshit
you bring into our town?

10:33.008 --> 10:35.302
There's two sixers' worth
of empties around your car.

10:35.302 --> 10:36.762
You've been waiting a while.

10:36.762 --> 10:38.722
And since this isn't
the most exciting spot in town,

10:38.722 --> 10:40.724
I got to assume
you've been waiting for me.

10:41.767 --> 10:44.227
Let me guess.
Rich guy in a fancy pickup

10:44.311 --> 10:47.147
put a fifty in each of your
pockets to take care of me?

10:48.190 --> 10:49.691
Hundred.

10:49.775 --> 10:52.027
Right. Well, this is
the wrong day to ask me

10:52.027 --> 10:53.653
to humor your bullshit.

10:53.737 --> 10:54.654
Hey!

10:56.156 --> 10:58.033
We're talking to you, man.

11:04.414 --> 11:06.124
Oh, Graham, you idiot.

11:06.208 --> 11:07.876
You're about to get
your ass kicked.

11:07.876 --> 11:09.586
No.

11:09.586 --> 11:12.214
I'm just gonna break the hands
of three drunk kids.

11:12.214 --> 11:14.633
There's four of us here.

11:14.633 --> 11:16.802
One of you has got to drive
to the hospital.

11:16.802 --> 11:18.220
Ooh...

11:25.519 --> 11:28.313
I-I know where the hospital is.

11:35.112 --> 11:38.031
What the hell
just rolled into Margrave?

12:44.222 --> 12:46.808
Hey, buddy.

12:46.892 --> 12:48.643
You okay?

12:54.483 --> 12:57.027
- Good boy.
- Hey. Hey.

12:57.027 --> 12:58.653
- Can I help you?
- No.

12:58.737 --> 13:00.655
Just giving your dog some water.

13:00.739 --> 13:02.449
I must've knocked the bowl over,

13:02.449 --> 13:04.451
'cause I gave him water
this morning.

13:05.494 --> 13:06.953
No, you didn't.

13:07.037 --> 13:08.497
Bowl was bone-dry.

13:08.497 --> 13:11.291
You calling me a liar?

13:13.752 --> 13:16.087
Yes.

13:17.797 --> 13:20.383
Well, I suggest
you leave my property.

13:24.054 --> 13:25.472
Good boy.

13:44.991 --> 13:46.993
What are you doing here?

13:47.077 --> 13:48.370
Wanted to check in,

13:48.370 --> 13:50.163
see if there's any official
progress on Joe's case

13:50.247 --> 13:51.540
before I head back out
to Hubble's.

13:51.540 --> 13:52.999
I can't talk right now.

13:53.083 --> 13:54.543
There's been another murder.

13:54.543 --> 13:56.086
Police Chief Morrison.

13:57.712 --> 13:59.714
For the record, I didn't do it.

13:59.798 --> 14:00.924
I know.

14:00.924 --> 14:02.551
What, did you stake me out
all night?

14:13.478 --> 14:15.981
Last night you wanted
to go everywhere with me.

14:32.247 --> 14:33.582
Captain.

14:33.582 --> 14:35.125
What did they do to the chief?

14:35.125 --> 14:36.751
Baker won't talk about it.

14:36.835 --> 14:39.713
Just keep the lookie-loos away,
all right?

14:43.425 --> 14:45.385
Yes, sir.

14:49.806 --> 14:52.017
- What is he doing here?
- You told me to keep an eye on him.

14:52.017 --> 14:53.435
I'm keeping an eye on him.

14:53.435 --> 14:55.270
Look. There he is.

14:56.521 --> 14:59.024
Crime scene's worse than
anything I ever saw in Boston.

14:59.024 --> 15:01.276
And I saw things in Boston.

15:01.276 --> 15:03.403
Was he nailed to a wall?

15:04.446 --> 15:06.239
How did you know that?

15:08.992 --> 15:11.202
Hey.

15:30.180 --> 15:32.140
These lacerations
appear to be shallow

15:32.140 --> 15:33.683
and were possibly done
with a serrated blade,

15:33.767 --> 15:36.061
which leads me to believe
that they were intended

15:36.061 --> 15:38.313
to inflict pain
rather than cause death.

15:38.313 --> 15:41.274
Preliminary examination
of Police Chief Edward Morrison.

15:41.358 --> 15:44.069
Subject has been nailed
to the wall contralaterally

15:44.069 --> 15:45.779
with six spikes,

15:45.779 --> 15:48.573
two of which were driven
between the ulna and the radius

15:48.657 --> 15:50.617
- near the wrist and...
- Jesus Christ.

15:50.617 --> 15:53.662
One laceration
to the left cheek.

15:53.662 --> 15:55.121
Prints?

15:55.205 --> 15:57.165
I ask the questions,

15:57.165 --> 15:59.292
how'd you know about the nails?

15:59.376 --> 16:01.795
Even in Margrave,
word doesn't travel that fast.

16:03.546 --> 16:06.675
They wore rubber overshoes
and gloves. Latex.

16:06.675 --> 16:08.343
Like whoever killed my brother.

16:08.343 --> 16:09.678
What makes you say that?

16:09.678 --> 16:11.554
Well, three people killed
my brother.

16:11.638 --> 16:13.890
At least four to do that
to a guy Morrison's size.

16:13.890 --> 16:16.142
Holy shit,
his fucking balls are gone!

16:16.226 --> 16:18.478
Keep it professional, Jasper.

16:18.478 --> 16:20.313
Cursing's the sign
of a weak mind

16:20.397 --> 16:22.857
- and a weaker character.
- Sorry, I'm just not used to this.

16:22.941 --> 16:25.443
You don't see this kind of thing
every day.

16:25.527 --> 16:26.778
Pardon my French, but...

16:26.778 --> 16:28.822
where the heck
are his testicles?

16:28.822 --> 16:30.115
In his stomach.

16:33.451 --> 16:35.620
You'll find them
during the autopsy.

16:37.414 --> 16:39.999
Okay, Reacher, outside.

16:46.965 --> 16:48.883
No more games.

16:48.967 --> 16:50.427
How do you know what you know?

16:50.427 --> 16:52.554
The people Hubble worked for
said they'd nail him to a wall

16:52.554 --> 16:54.723
and cut his balls off
if he caused problems.

16:54.723 --> 16:57.225
You said Hubble didn't tell you
anything in jail.

16:57.225 --> 17:01.020
I lied. My brother didn't trust
Margrave cops enough to tell you

17:01.104 --> 17:02.856
he was tracking something
down here. Why should I?

17:02.856 --> 17:04.858
Ever think your brother
didn't reach out to the cops

17:04.858 --> 17:06.818
because he <i>couldn't</i> reach out
to the cops?

17:06.818 --> 17:09.821
- Maybe he was dirty. Maybe...
- Think real hard before you finish that sentence.

17:09.821 --> 17:12.198
It'll determine how well your
jaw works the rest of your life.

17:12.282 --> 17:14.117
Joe was clean.

17:14.117 --> 17:15.910
Unlike that modern art piece
hanging inside.

17:15.994 --> 17:17.954
So you're saying
that Morrison was working

17:17.954 --> 17:20.331
with the same killers
Hubble was mixed up with?

17:20.415 --> 17:23.960
That or we just saw a big fat
coincidence nailed to the wall.

17:25.003 --> 17:27.714
What I want to know is who else
in Margrave PD's in on it.

17:27.714 --> 17:30.341
Stevenson seems suspicious,
and Baker wouldn't go

17:30.425 --> 17:32.302
into the bathroom with me
at the station house.

17:32.302 --> 17:33.762
A bathroom with a window in it.

17:33.762 --> 17:35.221
I was a murder suspect.

17:35.305 --> 17:36.765
Baker wasn't concerned

17:36.765 --> 17:38.224
'cause he knew you didn't do it.

17:38.308 --> 17:39.476
Which means he knows who did.

17:39.476 --> 17:41.895
Want to tell me who else
on my team is crooked?

17:41.895 --> 17:43.563
Sure. Roscoe checks out,

17:43.563 --> 17:45.940
'cause she dug in
to get me out of prison.

17:46.024 --> 17:47.317
But you're hiding something.

17:47.317 --> 17:49.402
Tell me, why does
a Black cop from Boston

17:49.486 --> 17:52.155
with a 20-year pension come work
in a Southern backwater town

17:52.155 --> 17:54.157
in the middle of nowhere?

17:54.157 --> 17:56.034
You next in line
for Morrison's job?

17:56.034 --> 17:57.410
For your information,

17:57.494 --> 17:58.953
Mayor Teale
didn't promote Finlay.

17:59.037 --> 18:00.663
He just appointed himself
acting chief.

18:00.747 --> 18:02.040
Since when?

18:02.040 --> 18:04.209
This morning.
Came here to tell you.

18:04.209 --> 18:06.544
Whoever's running this
had Morrison under his thumb.

18:06.628 --> 18:09.547
No one sits in the chief's chair
unless they're under it, too.

18:09.631 --> 18:11.716
They skipped you
to get to Teale.

18:14.385 --> 18:16.513
So I guess that means
he's dirty and you're okay.

18:16.513 --> 18:19.516
Nothing means more to me
than your vote of confidence.

18:21.059 --> 18:22.977
But you're probably right.

18:23.061 --> 18:26.397
At least we know
who we can trust.

18:26.481 --> 18:29.150
I'm gonna call my buddy
at the FBI...

18:29.234 --> 18:31.402
no staties, no Feds.

18:31.486 --> 18:33.613
- He wants this kept in-house.
- Outside investigators

18:33.613 --> 18:35.657
will send whoever did this
into hiding.

18:35.657 --> 18:37.992
We'll let them think they've
got it under control for now.

18:38.076 --> 18:39.744
There's no "we" here.

18:41.955 --> 18:44.290
The Morrisons were killed
for a misstep--

18:44.374 --> 18:46.042
not pinning the murder on me,

18:46.042 --> 18:47.710
Hubble walking out
of prison alive--

18:47.794 --> 18:49.254
but the way they were killed
sent a message

18:50.380 --> 18:52.465
Don't screw up
and don't cross us.

18:52.549 --> 18:54.467
You two think
you can go it alone?

18:54.551 --> 18:56.010
You can't go it alone.

18:56.094 --> 18:57.637
There's only "we" here.

18:57.637 --> 19:00.557
You don't see that, I'll find
whoever killed Joe on my own.

19:04.936 --> 19:07.438
Great. Teale's called
an emergency town meeting.

19:07.522 --> 19:09.399
Be careful around him.

19:09.399 --> 19:11.526
Came down South
for peace and quiet.

19:11.526 --> 19:13.653
Now I've caught four bodies.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.029
Five.

19:15.113 --> 19:16.990
Hubble, probably.

19:16.990 --> 19:19.951
If they'd do this to a cop,
why not a banker?

19:19.951 --> 19:21.703
Roscoe...

19:21.703 --> 19:23.037
On my way there now.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.711
Oh. I thought
you might've been Paul.

19:29.711 --> 19:31.045
That's why I left the gate open.

19:31.129 --> 19:32.463
He never came home?

19:32.547 --> 19:34.716
He called late last night,
said that he had to speak

19:34.716 --> 19:36.843
to some people about sorting out
this bank madness,

19:36.843 --> 19:39.304
and when I woke,
I realized he'd never come home.

19:39.304 --> 19:41.723
His phone goes to voice mail.

19:41.723 --> 19:43.892
Listen, I...
I have been with Paul

19:43.892 --> 19:45.935
since freshman year, UGA.

19:46.019 --> 19:48.980
He has never once not come home.

19:48.980 --> 19:51.733
Okay, all right, just a minute.

19:51.733 --> 19:53.526
Um...

19:54.569 --> 19:56.112
I'll stay here since I'm armed.

19:56.112 --> 19:57.488
You go find Finlay.

19:57.572 --> 19:58.781
He'll know what to do with them,

19:58.865 --> 20:00.074
but they need
some kind of protection.

20:02.493 --> 20:04.370
I need your car.

20:14.672 --> 20:18.801
You see anyone under six five
come near this house...

20:18.885 --> 20:20.303
- shoot 'em.
- Finlay's five eight.

20:20.303 --> 20:21.971
- Yup.
- Are you taking that knife?

20:22.055 --> 20:23.890
You want to give me your gun?

20:26.225 --> 20:28.227
That's what I thought.

20:29.312 --> 20:31.648
We will find
the person or persons

20:31.648 --> 20:33.232
responsible for these crimes.

20:33.316 --> 20:35.401
And we will punish them

20:35.485 --> 20:38.071
to the fullest extent
of the law.

20:38.071 --> 20:41.199
If they're killing cops
in their own homes,

20:41.199 --> 20:42.659
then what chance
do any of us got?

20:42.659 --> 20:45.203
A damn good chance.
Because as of today,

20:45.203 --> 20:46.955
per the powers given to me

20:46.955 --> 20:48.748
by the town charter,

20:48.748 --> 20:52.168
I have appointed myself
chief of police.

20:52.168 --> 20:54.545
And I will not sleep

20:54.629 --> 20:57.173
until we have the perpetrators
behind bars

20:57.173 --> 20:59.926
and on their way
to getting the needle!

21:02.929 --> 21:04.555
But what the hell
do you know

21:04.639 --> 21:05.890
- about law enforcement?
- That's right!

21:05.974 --> 21:07.934
We need us a real police chief

21:07.934 --> 21:09.769
and a real chief detective, too.

21:09.769 --> 21:12.063
- Yeah!
- Think he's talking about you.

21:12.063 --> 21:13.731
All due respect,

21:13.815 --> 21:16.192
but what does some Yankee cop
know about Margrave?

21:16.192 --> 21:17.276
- Yeah!
- That's right.

21:17.360 --> 21:19.278
We ain't seen a murder
in 20 years,

21:19.362 --> 21:22.073
and now there's four--
four!-- in two days.

21:22.073 --> 21:25.326
Do we have a serial killer
in Margrave or not?

21:25.410 --> 21:27.578
These killings are not related.

21:27.662 --> 21:30.331
Oh? What about that animal
you arrested out at the diner?

21:30.415 --> 21:31.916
- Yeah!
- I think she's talking about you.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.252
He comes to town,
and people just start dying?

21:34.252 --> 21:37.171
Y'all had him in jail.
Why'd you let him go?

21:37.255 --> 21:39.424
Order!

21:41.009 --> 21:43.261
Order!

21:43.261 --> 21:44.595
Everyone, please!

21:44.679 --> 21:47.265
Please. Calm down. Sit down.

21:47.265 --> 21:49.058
Sit down.

21:49.142 --> 21:51.269
I know you're all scared.

21:51.269 --> 21:54.689
But Mr. Reacher has
a rock-solid alibi.

21:54.689 --> 21:57.025
And for those of you
who don't know,

21:57.025 --> 21:59.902
one of the victims was
Mr. Reacher's brother, Joseph.

21:59.986 --> 22:02.238
So he has as much invested

22:02.238 --> 22:05.450
in finding these murders
as any one of us here.

22:07.493 --> 22:09.495
You know...

22:09.579 --> 22:13.416
when I moved Kliner Industries
to this town five years ago,

22:13.416 --> 22:15.960
Margrave was run-down.

22:16.044 --> 22:18.087
Broken.

22:18.171 --> 22:20.048
- Main Street boarded up. Right?
- Yeah.

22:20.048 --> 22:22.008
But I said to myself,

22:22.008 --> 22:25.344
these are the kind of people
who can bounce back.

22:25.428 --> 22:28.264
Right? Who can survive anything.

22:28.264 --> 22:30.725
I have faith
in our police force.

22:30.725 --> 22:33.436
I have faith
in Chief Detective Finlay.

22:33.436 --> 22:36.481
I have faith
in our new chief of police,

22:36.481 --> 22:38.608
Mayor Teale.

22:38.608 --> 22:41.152
And I promise I will provide
whatever funds,

22:41.152 --> 22:45.323
whatever resources
to find whomever is responsible

22:45.323 --> 22:47.909
for these heinous acts.

22:47.909 --> 22:49.827
You have my word.

23:05.259 --> 23:06.928
Mayor Teale.

23:07.970 --> 23:10.223
A word?

23:10.223 --> 23:12.225
<i>Chief</i> Teale now, Captain.

23:12.225 --> 23:14.477
Mm, of course. My mistake.

23:14.477 --> 23:16.437
I just wanted to let you know

23:16.521 --> 23:18.314
that I'm gonna start
cross-referencing forensics

23:18.314 --> 23:20.566
from both murder sites
to establish pattern.

23:20.650 --> 23:22.944
Pattern? What the hell
has Morrison and his wife

23:22.944 --> 23:24.487
got to do with an out-of-towner

23:24.487 --> 23:26.572
and some fella he was probably
diddlin' under an overpass?

23:26.656 --> 23:28.366
Well, that's
what I want to find out.

23:28.366 --> 23:30.451
These killings are not related.

23:30.535 --> 23:32.078
Over the course of his career,

23:32.078 --> 23:34.789
Morrison took countless
criminals out of circulation.

23:34.789 --> 23:36.249
Comb the archives,

23:36.249 --> 23:39.085
track down the biggest scumbags
he ever arrested

23:39.085 --> 23:41.546
who have since been released
or paroled, pardoned,

23:41.546 --> 23:42.839
everything in between...

23:42.839 --> 23:44.632
that's how you're gonna find
his killer.

23:44.632 --> 23:46.592
Those are your orders.

23:46.676 --> 23:47.802
You copy, Captain?

23:48.845 --> 23:50.638
And the bodies by the highway?

23:50.638 --> 23:52.431
A police officer was crucified!

23:54.433 --> 23:56.686
I think that takes priority.

23:56.686 --> 23:58.855
Or did they do things
differently

23:58.855 --> 24:01.274
up there in Massachusetts?

24:01.274 --> 24:02.942
Hmm?

24:02.942 --> 24:04.610
Copy that.

24:13.870 --> 24:15.913
Teale's trying to frame
the Morrison hit

24:15.997 --> 24:17.915
as a revenge killing.

24:17.999 --> 24:20.209
Just sent me off
to chase my tail.

24:20.293 --> 24:22.628
- Told you he's dirty.
- I'm prone to agree,

24:22.712 --> 24:24.714
but incompetence
can look like malevolence,

24:24.714 --> 24:26.549
and it's
a whole lot more common.

24:26.549 --> 24:28.551
You know who's not incompetent?

24:28.551 --> 24:30.261
Kliner.

24:32.221 --> 24:34.515
You one
of those conspiracy nuts?

24:34.599 --> 24:36.851
Guys with the kind
of money and power Kliner wields

24:36.851 --> 24:38.269
are rarely angels.

24:38.269 --> 24:39.979
We need to look into him.

24:39.979 --> 24:41.606
You want this town to hate you
more than it already does?

24:41.606 --> 24:43.691
Then start smearing Kliner.
And I'm not gonna be able

24:43.691 --> 24:45.526
to look into anyone
except the losers

24:45.610 --> 24:47.153
in Morrison's old case files.

24:47.153 --> 24:49.655
No, that's what you'll pretend
to do. Roscoe, too.

24:49.739 --> 24:51.866
Give us cover
while we work the real angles.

24:51.866 --> 24:53.868
Like Joe's rental car.

24:53.868 --> 24:57.163
Must have had one, but none
was left at the murder scene.

24:57.163 --> 24:59.373
You're handing out
assignments now?

24:59.457 --> 25:02.501
Yes. And the next one has to do
with Hubble's wife and kids.

25:02.585 --> 25:05.338
They need protection,
even if Hubble's already dead.

25:05.338 --> 25:07.256
These guys get antsy,
think Charlie has

25:07.340 --> 25:09.258
even a one percent chance
of knowing anything...

25:09.342 --> 25:11.093
I get it.

25:11.177 --> 25:14.513
My FBI buddy I wanted
to reach out to earlier...

25:14.597 --> 25:17.350
name's Picard,
Atlanta field office.

25:17.350 --> 25:19.393
I'll call you when it's set up.

25:19.477 --> 25:21.854
- I don't have a phone.
- Get one.

25:21.938 --> 25:23.689
Can we trust Picard?

25:23.773 --> 25:25.233
Known him for years.

25:25.233 --> 25:27.944
Gave me the best advice
I ever got.

25:27.944 --> 25:30.905
Don't take the Margrave job.

25:35.952 --> 25:37.578
Mr. Reacher?

25:37.662 --> 25:40.623
I'd like to offer my apologies
for your arrest.

25:40.623 --> 25:43.000
My condolences for your brother.

25:43.084 --> 25:47.171
Tragedy when a person is struck
down in his prime like that.

25:47.255 --> 25:50.132
But my hand to God,
we'll find the killer.

25:52.677 --> 25:54.637
We'd be happy to keep you
updated on the investigation.

25:54.637 --> 25:56.472
Just leave
your contact information

25:56.472 --> 25:58.516
with the department
before you head out.

25:58.516 --> 26:00.851
- I'm not leaving.
- Oh.

26:00.935 --> 26:02.853
It was my understanding
you were just passing through.

26:02.937 --> 26:04.105
You understood wrong.

26:04.105 --> 26:06.357
I figured
I'd stick around a while.

26:06.357 --> 26:09.068
Margrave's such a nice town.

26:10.444 --> 26:12.154
Used to be.

26:13.698 --> 26:15.700
Not so much lately.

26:25.293 --> 26:27.420
Heard about
your brother.

26:27.420 --> 26:29.088
May the Lord bless him

26:29.088 --> 26:31.924
and keep him
in a plastic container.

26:33.551 --> 26:35.177
You looking for payback?

26:35.261 --> 26:38.097
Payback, justice, vengeance.

26:38.097 --> 26:41.058
Looking for the whole gang.

26:41.142 --> 26:43.060
You might not be the only one.

26:43.144 --> 26:45.229
- Meaning?
- Meaning...

26:45.313 --> 26:46.772
you wouldn't happen to have

26:46.856 --> 26:49.817
a couple of Spanish-speaking
amigos in town, would you?

26:49.817 --> 26:51.944
- No.
- Makes sense.

26:52.028 --> 26:55.072
'Cause the two fellas
come by my shop asking about you

26:55.156 --> 26:57.533
didn't seem all that friendly.

26:57.533 --> 26:59.702
Watch your back, Mr. Reacher.

26:59.702 --> 27:01.829
Are you worried about me,
Mr. Mosley?

27:01.829 --> 27:05.291
Worried about my bottom line.

27:05.291 --> 27:09.378
Uh, you might need another shave
'fore you leave town.

27:09.462 --> 27:11.088
Very true.

27:11.172 --> 27:13.466
My husband
trusted Reacher.

27:13.466 --> 27:15.760
Is he a good person?

27:18.262 --> 27:20.014
I think so.

27:21.057 --> 27:24.143
We don't really have the luxury
of certainty right now, but...

27:24.143 --> 27:27.855
bad things are happening
and Reacher can help us.

27:27.855 --> 27:29.732
I'm back.

27:29.732 --> 27:32.193
We're in here.

27:33.235 --> 27:35.613
Get some food together,
pack your bags for the kids.

27:35.613 --> 27:37.531
- Where we going?
- Got a call from Finlay.

27:37.615 --> 27:39.658
FBI agent named Picard is
on his way.

27:39.742 --> 27:41.660
He's taking you
into protective custody.

27:41.744 --> 27:43.204
I bought a burner.

27:43.204 --> 27:45.247
Here's the number.

27:45.331 --> 27:47.708
I'd feel safer if we stayed
with the two of you.

27:47.792 --> 27:49.752
We've got to work the case.

27:49.752 --> 27:51.128
Picard'll keep you safe.

27:51.212 --> 27:52.922
It's what your husband
would have wanted.

27:53.964 --> 27:56.384
Why are you talking about him
in the past tense?

28:03.933 --> 28:05.851
We have to assume Paul's dead.

28:05.935 --> 28:07.228
They tried to kill him
in prison.

28:07.228 --> 28:08.938
They killed
Morrison and his wife.

28:08.938 --> 28:10.231
Your husband's gone missing,

28:10.231 --> 28:12.233
so they most likely
killed him, too.

28:12.233 --> 28:13.484
There'll be time
to grieve later.

28:13.484 --> 28:15.027
You have to think
about your kids.

28:16.070 --> 28:18.072
You need to pack.

28:19.073 --> 28:20.616
Okay?

28:20.616 --> 28:23.035
- Okay?
- Okay, okay.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.002
I'll go wait for Picard.

28:52.440 --> 28:54.024
Dance!
Dance! Dance! Dance!

28:54.108 --> 28:56.193
Dance! Dance! Dance! Dance!

28:57.987 --> 28:59.780
Let's go, Billy! Dance!

28:59.864 --> 29:01.031
Dance! Dance!

29:02.867 --> 29:05.161
Okay, Mr. Predicto,

29:05.161 --> 29:07.204
should Billy keep dancing?

29:08.247 --> 29:10.249
"All signs indicate yes."

29:10.249 --> 29:12.001
Come on, man!

29:14.003 --> 29:15.463
Hey!

29:20.885 --> 29:22.428
You boys looking
for a dance partner?

29:22.428 --> 29:25.431
You think you can take
all of us?

29:28.184 --> 29:30.603
Let's find out.

29:31.729 --> 29:34.398
It's Billy's dad! Go, go, go, go, go!

30:08.098 --> 30:10.059
We're on the move.

30:10.059 --> 30:11.894
It's not safe anymore. Let's go.

30:11.894 --> 30:13.479
- I'm not ready.
- Let's go. Now.

30:14.522 --> 30:15.940
Girls!

30:15.940 --> 30:18.651
Lucy, come get your backpack.

30:21.403 --> 30:23.322
Okay, you got
everything you need, right?

30:26.742 --> 30:28.702
Hey, hey, hey. Easy.

30:28.786 --> 30:30.496
I'm Picard.

30:36.335 --> 30:38.045
Mind putting the cannon down?

30:43.551 --> 30:45.636
Told you I need my own gun.

30:47.805 --> 30:49.598
I'll get the bags.

30:49.682 --> 30:52.476
All right.
Come on, girls, come on.

30:52.560 --> 30:55.229
Hop in.

30:55.229 --> 30:58.566
Here, help your sister
with her seat belt.

30:58.566 --> 31:01.110
- Got it?
- Okay, this is off the books.

31:01.110 --> 31:03.445
To get a family into
an actual protection program

31:03.529 --> 31:05.155
would take time and red tape.

31:05.239 --> 31:07.116
Finlay said he can't get the FBI
officially involved yet,

31:07.116 --> 31:09.076
so I'm gonna take
a few personal days,

31:09.076 --> 31:10.744
watch the family myself.

31:10.828 --> 31:13.330
Bottom line, do not let this
bite me in the ass.

31:13.414 --> 31:15.749
We are talking
about my career here.

31:15.833 --> 31:18.168
Finlay and I are tight;
we ain't that tight.

31:18.252 --> 31:19.503
We won't let you get burned.

31:19.587 --> 31:21.547
Better not.

31:24.550 --> 31:27.052
I told him not to take this job.

31:32.141 --> 31:34.685
- Now we get to work.
- I'm gonna make some calls,

31:34.685 --> 31:36.312
find out what Joe was doing
with Homeland.

31:36.312 --> 31:38.105
You're gonna have to do it
on the side.

31:38.105 --> 31:39.398
Teale's got everyone
on a snipe hunt.

31:39.398 --> 31:41.317
- Finlay'll fill you in.
- Okay.

31:41.317 --> 31:44.278
- What about you?
- I'm gonna go see that guard Spivey at Warburton.

31:44.278 --> 31:46.363
Whoever paid him
to set up Hubble to be killed

31:46.447 --> 31:48.532
is who's running this thing.
Spivey's the key.

31:48.616 --> 31:50.784
He won't tell you anything.

31:50.868 --> 31:52.870
Depends on how I ask.

32:01.754 --> 32:02.880
Taylor Spivey.

32:02.880 --> 32:04.882
Chief Detective Finlay,
Margrave PD.

32:04.882 --> 32:06.884
Calling on account
of Jack Reacher.

32:06.884 --> 32:08.927
Yeah, well, he's pissed.

32:09.011 --> 32:11.305
Says he got tuned up pretty good
while under your roof,

32:11.305 --> 32:12.765
and now he's suing.

32:12.765 --> 32:14.683
Well, he was your prisoner,

32:14.767 --> 32:17.311
and I'm not losing my job
over this.

32:17.311 --> 32:19.521
Is there somewhere
we can meet up,

32:19.605 --> 32:22.775
get our stories straight before
lawyers start sniffing around?

32:25.944 --> 32:27.112
Okay.

32:29.365 --> 32:31.575
See you there, jackass.

32:40.959 --> 32:43.003
Hey, Spivey.

32:43.087 --> 32:45.839
Eh, look who it is.

32:45.923 --> 32:48.676
You know,
I never met Detective Finlay,

32:48.676 --> 32:50.844
but I heard all about him.

32:50.928 --> 32:52.846
And you sure as hell don't sound
like a Black man from Boston

32:52.930 --> 32:54.056
on the phone.

32:54.056 --> 32:57.017
Figured you were setting me up,

32:57.101 --> 32:59.728
so I thought
I'd return the favor.

33:04.566 --> 33:06.944
You should've let those boys
kill you in the prison.

33:06.944 --> 33:10.531
It would've been
a lot less painful.

33:10.531 --> 33:12.157
Adios.

33:19.540 --> 33:21.500
Let's go.

33:26.088 --> 33:27.965
No.

33:29.007 --> 33:30.718
It's too small.

33:30.718 --> 33:32.428
It'll be uncomfortable.

33:32.428 --> 33:35.305
Not as uncomfortable as a bullet
to the stomach, <i>pendejo.</i>

33:35.389 --> 33:37.725
Well, the smart move would be
to shoot me right here,

33:37.725 --> 33:39.476
but you haven't done that yet.

33:39.560 --> 33:41.478
Maybe you don't want
to draw attention

33:41.562 --> 33:43.272
firing outside a crowded bar.

33:43.272 --> 33:45.566
Or maybe you have orders
to take me to your boss

33:45.566 --> 33:47.526
so he can find out
how much I know.

33:50.571 --> 33:52.823
Whatever it is, it means
that when I make my move,

33:52.823 --> 33:54.491
you're gonna hesitate.

33:54.575 --> 33:58.036
And you guys know what Cato said
about hesitation, right?

33:59.079 --> 34:00.998
"He who hesitates..."

34:09.339 --> 34:11.800
<i>Puta,</i> I'm gonna cut you.

34:42.164 --> 34:43.290
Stop where you are!

34:44.583 --> 34:46.627
This is Mike-7. I need backup
at the Blue Cat.

34:46.627 --> 34:49.421
Foot pursuit of one suspect.
Second at large.

34:55.469 --> 34:58.347
All right, yep. Th-Thank you.

34:58.347 --> 35:00.390
Bye, now.

35:00.474 --> 35:03.060
Both Avis and Hertz confirmed,
no unaccounted-for

35:03.060 --> 35:04.853
rental cars in the entire state.

35:04.937 --> 35:08.106
How many more are we waiting
on answers from, six?

35:08.190 --> 35:10.400
In the Atlanta
airport alone.

35:13.487 --> 35:15.489
It didn't go as planned.

35:16.740 --> 35:19.743
Well...

35:19.827 --> 35:22.037
this one's special.

35:22.037 --> 35:23.413
You need stitches.

35:23.497 --> 35:25.290
No, I don't.

35:27.084 --> 35:29.086
Fine. Superglue it is.

35:29.086 --> 35:32.714
Just got off the phone
with the Georgia State Police.

35:32.798 --> 35:35.717
No suspects from the Blue Cat
brawl were apprehended.

35:35.801 --> 35:38.595
Would've been nice
to question them.

35:38.679 --> 35:41.390
Maybe next time don't pull
something like this by yourself.

35:41.390 --> 35:44.017
I said you could work with us.

35:44.101 --> 35:46.144
It's not my fault
Spivey didn't buy it.

35:46.228 --> 35:48.355
I shoved a pole
as far up my ass as I could;

35:48.355 --> 35:50.148
I still couldn't
sound like you.

35:50.232 --> 35:52.401
You've been here a couple
of days and you've already

35:52.401 --> 35:54.486
thrown down in Warburton,
beaten up some locals

35:54.570 --> 35:56.780
and fought a couple of goons
in a parking lot.

35:56.864 --> 35:58.448
They weren't goons.

35:58.532 --> 36:00.117
Probably military
or ex-military.

36:00.117 --> 36:02.661
- South American.
- How could you know that?

36:02.661 --> 36:03.662
'Cause if they weren't
I would've killed them

36:03.662 --> 36:04.663
within ten seconds.

36:04.663 --> 36:05.998
How'd you know they were

36:05.998 --> 36:07.332
South American military?

36:07.416 --> 36:09.334
Spoke Spanish, had Glock-17s

36:09.418 --> 36:10.878
and the technique one guy used
to head-butt me

36:10.878 --> 36:12.337
was from a martial art
called Reisy.

36:12.421 --> 36:14.172
Hardly anyone uses
except branches of

36:14.256 --> 36:16.633
South American special forces.

36:16.717 --> 36:18.093
Plus, if they weren't,

36:18.093 --> 36:19.803
I would've killed them
within ten seconds.

36:19.887 --> 36:22.389
Why would South American
military be involved in this?

36:22.389 --> 36:23.932
Don't know.

36:24.016 --> 36:25.642
You ever see anyone
like that around Margrave?

36:25.726 --> 36:27.561
Not till you showed up.

36:27.561 --> 36:29.730
Then they're hired muscle.
Not running the show.

36:29.730 --> 36:33.567
- You're all set.
- I have no idea what the hell's going on around here.

36:33.567 --> 36:35.777
Well, I might,
if you're done talking

36:35.861 --> 36:37.654
about Spivey
and South American military.

36:37.738 --> 36:40.574
Turns out Joe was working for
the Secret Service's division

36:40.574 --> 36:42.784
- of Homeland.
- Doing what?

36:42.868 --> 36:45.078
- No one could or would give me any answers, but...
- Secret Service covers

36:45.162 --> 36:47.748
everything from mail fraud
to protecting the president

36:47.748 --> 36:49.333
to child exploitation.

36:49.333 --> 36:52.377
Your brother could've been
involved in almost anything.

36:52.461 --> 36:54.463
Counterfeiting?
Hubble specialized

36:54.463 --> 36:56.381
- in currency management.
- Yeah, maybe.

36:56.465 --> 36:58.508
But money's at the root
of every crime there is.

36:58.592 --> 37:00.677
Drugs, guns,
human trafficking...

37:00.761 --> 37:03.096
- all rotates around cash.
- Well...

37:03.180 --> 37:05.933
I left a voice mail with
the Office of Investigations.

37:05.933 --> 37:07.893
Figure people usually get hurt
when they're looking

37:07.893 --> 37:10.604
into something others don't
want 'em to, assumed maybe

37:10.604 --> 37:12.564
Joe was an investigator
like you.

37:12.648 --> 37:14.650
Good logic.

37:16.068 --> 37:17.778
Thanks, Doc.

37:17.778 --> 37:19.363
Where do you think you're going?

37:19.363 --> 37:22.032
Homeland Security won't
call back till tomorrow

37:22.032 --> 37:24.368
and by now Spivey's heard things
have gone sideways at the bar.

37:24.368 --> 37:26.620
Since his bosses feed screwups
their own testicles,

37:26.620 --> 37:28.914
my guess is he's gotten
out of Dodge for a while.

37:28.914 --> 37:31.166
I'm gonna find his house
and search it.

37:31.166 --> 37:33.168
Prison guard's
home address won't be public.

37:33.168 --> 37:35.587
And county offices won't be open
till morning.

37:35.671 --> 37:38.173
I'll chase it down then
and handle it myself.

37:38.173 --> 37:40.008
You?

37:40.092 --> 37:41.843
Go get some rest.

37:41.927 --> 37:43.929
I'm getting a beer.

37:43.929 --> 37:45.514
Absolutely not.

37:45.514 --> 37:47.099
You saw those people
at town hall.

37:47.099 --> 37:48.475
They were ready to grab torches

37:48.475 --> 37:50.018
and come after you
like Frankenstein.

37:50.102 --> 37:52.270
Frankenstein was
the doctor.

37:52.354 --> 37:54.189
They went after
Frankenstein's monster.

37:54.189 --> 37:56.400
Details matter.

37:56.400 --> 37:59.736
You're going back to your motel.

37:59.820 --> 38:02.280
I'm just gonna sit in a bar,

38:02.364 --> 38:04.408
have a beer
and think all this through.

38:04.408 --> 38:06.660
And then someone will say
something you don't like

38:06.660 --> 38:08.787
and you'll break
their head open... again.

38:08.787 --> 38:11.039
Not gonna happen.

38:11.123 --> 38:13.375
Now you can go to your motel
right now and sleep

38:13.375 --> 38:15.961
in a comfortable bed
or I can arrest you for vagrancy

38:15.961 --> 38:18.422
and you can sleep
in my holding cell.

38:18.422 --> 38:20.215
He's not a vagrant. He's a hobo.

38:22.217 --> 38:24.094
What?

38:30.809 --> 38:32.894
Just tail him.

38:32.978 --> 38:35.480
Make sure he goes
straight back to the motel.

38:47.993 --> 38:50.245
Hey, I get it.

38:50.245 --> 38:51.747
In the past few days,
you've lost

38:51.747 --> 38:53.165
one brother and had four fights.

38:53.165 --> 38:55.375
If anybody needs a drink,
it's you.

38:59.546 --> 39:01.715
There's a roadhouse.

39:01.715 --> 39:03.800
Just across the border
in Alabama.

39:03.884 --> 39:05.552
Nobody knows you there.

39:05.552 --> 39:07.846
Cold beer, hot music.

39:07.846 --> 39:10.098
But you got to behave.

39:13.143 --> 39:15.896
Maybe they'll even play
that blues stuff you like.

39:19.399 --> 39:20.567
Okay.

39:20.567 --> 39:22.611
Follow me to my place.

39:22.611 --> 39:24.863
I got to change into something
less "law enforcement."

39:24.863 --> 39:27.074
And we got to stop
by a gas station,

39:27.074 --> 39:29.534
and get you a T-shirt
with a little less blood on it.

39:31.036 --> 39:32.829
You're
listening to WGUT,

39:32.913 --> 39:34.372
<i>blues that hit you
right in the gut.</i>

39:34.456 --> 39:37.125
<i>Here's "Police Dog Blues"

39:37.209 --> 39:40.921
<i>originally recorded

39:40.921 --> 39:42.964
Hey, isn't that your guy, Blake?

39:43.048 --> 39:45.801
Yep.

39:45.801 --> 39:48.720

Feeling any better?

40:35.851 --> 40:37.978
Not feeling worse.

40:39.563 --> 40:41.731
Well, that's a start, ain't it?

40:48.321 --> 40:50.323
Uh-oh.

40:50.407 --> 40:52.117
They're playin' Patsy.

40:52.117 --> 40:53.952
You know what that means.

40:53.952 --> 40:56.663
- No.
- <i>♪ I'm crazy...</i>

40:56.663 --> 40:59.541

Practically the law.

40:59.541 --> 41:01.585
I don't dance.

41:01.585 --> 41:03.253
You're telling me
that your mama

41:03.253 --> 41:04.754
never taught her sons
how to dance?

41:04.838 --> 41:07.757
She did, but when I ask
people to dance,

41:07.841 --> 41:09.759
it usually precedes
a lot of punching.

41:09.843 --> 41:12.053
Good thing I'm doing the asking.

41:12.137 --> 41:13.889

Move your ass, big guy.

42:53.363 --> 42:55.782
You should've taken my jacket.

42:57.242 --> 42:59.577
I'm a big girl.

43:03.790 --> 43:06.126
Whoa, look at this.

43:08.920 --> 43:10.880
Hey, take a beat, champ.

43:10.964 --> 43:13.091
We're far from Margrave.

43:13.091 --> 43:14.676
Not far enough.

43:14.676 --> 43:16.636
I say go, you duck.

43:43.204 --> 43:44.956
What's goin' on?

43:45.040 --> 43:47.167
Road east to the highway's
flooded.

43:47.167 --> 43:49.252
No one's
getting through tonight.

43:55.884 --> 43:58.136
Is there a motel near here?

44:07.354 --> 44:10.315
Sorry I didn't have anything
in my truck your size.

44:10.315 --> 44:12.734
Could've sworn I had
a paint tarp

44:12.734 --> 44:14.903
or a circus tent.

44:14.903 --> 44:16.571
Funny.

44:16.571 --> 44:19.574
I got a sampling
from the vending machine.

44:19.574 --> 44:21.576
Wow.

44:23.119 --> 44:25.705
- You always eat this well?
- I was hungry.

44:25.789 --> 44:27.916
Didn't think room service
would deliver this late.

44:27.916 --> 44:29.876
Hmm.

44:29.876 --> 44:31.836
Oh, yeah.

44:31.920 --> 44:34.381
Going straight
for the Clark Bar.

44:34.381 --> 44:36.424
Clark Bars are the best.

44:36.508 --> 44:38.968
Had these at every PX
on every base

44:39.052 --> 44:41.388
I ever lived at
when I was a kid.

44:41.388 --> 44:43.932
No matter where we were at
the time, Joe and I could always

44:43.932 --> 44:46.184
find a Clark Bar.

44:47.894 --> 44:49.813
- You want half?
- No.

44:49.813 --> 44:51.398
Prefer Zagnut.

44:51.398 --> 44:53.024
No one prefers Zagnut.

44:53.108 --> 44:55.944
- Excuse me?
- What are you eating right now?

44:55.944 --> 44:57.112
Read me the flavor.

44:57.112 --> 44:58.780
Spi...

44:58.780 --> 45:00.115
Read it out loud.

45:00.115 --> 45:02.033
"Spicy Cajun Crawtators."

45:02.117 --> 45:03.660
There you go.

45:03.660 --> 45:05.412
I'll take a Clark Bar.

45:10.834 --> 45:12.836
You okay down there?

45:14.462 --> 45:16.464
I've slept in worse places.

45:18.508 --> 45:21.094
Been all over, huh?

45:21.094 --> 45:23.179
Barely left Margrave.

45:25.348 --> 45:27.684
Never really wanted to.

45:27.684 --> 45:30.979
My family's been here
since the town was founded.

45:30.979 --> 45:33.857
Like the Teales.

45:33.857 --> 45:35.733
Fuck the Teales.

45:35.817 --> 45:37.861
Conklins built this town,
Teales stole it.

45:37.861 --> 45:41.197
Old Casper Teale got in bed
with the railroads.

45:41.281 --> 45:43.283
Swindled farmers
out of their land

45:43.283 --> 45:46.494
and laid tracks
right through their crops.

45:46.578 --> 45:48.872
You still have family
in Margrave?

45:48.872 --> 45:50.957
My parents died
when I was a kid.

45:50.957 --> 45:53.251
But I had Gray.

45:53.251 --> 45:55.211
Gray?

45:55.295 --> 45:57.547
Had Finlay's job before Finlay.

45:57.547 --> 46:01.092
He was my parents' best friend.

46:04.512 --> 46:07.557
Always... looked out for me.

46:07.557 --> 46:09.559
Kind of like a second dad.

46:09.559 --> 46:11.686
Taught everything I know
about being a cop.

46:11.686 --> 46:16.024
How to work a case, keep
your notes and files organized.

46:16.024 --> 46:18.943
He was the most

46:19.027 --> 46:22.155
fastidious person
I have ever met.

46:23.907 --> 46:25.783
I mean, the man only had
a horseshoe of hair,

46:25.867 --> 46:27.911
and he still had Mosley trim it
for him once a week.

46:29.871 --> 46:32.582
But he had a dark side, too.

46:34.709 --> 46:38.004
He... was depressed a lot.

46:38.004 --> 46:40.131
Never married.

46:40.215 --> 46:42.091
No kids. Drank.

46:44.344 --> 46:48.056
Hung himself from the rafters
in his garage about a year ago.

46:48.056 --> 46:50.934
I'm sorry.

46:50.934 --> 46:53.978
Always gave me daisies
on my birthday.

46:55.522 --> 46:58.191
Daisies are my favorite.

46:58.191 --> 47:00.944
What about you?

47:00.944 --> 47:03.655
Snapdragons.

47:03.655 --> 47:05.615
Cool name, hard to kill.

47:06.908 --> 47:08.826
Yeah, yeah.

47:08.910 --> 47:11.454
That sounds
like somebody I know.

47:11.538 --> 47:13.706
No, that wasn't
what I was asking you.

47:13.790 --> 47:15.750
I was...

47:15.750 --> 47:18.086
I was wondering if you had
any family I didn't know about?

47:18.086 --> 47:21.381
No. Was basically down to Joe.

47:21.381 --> 47:23.466
Hmm.

47:25.218 --> 47:27.345
If I hadn't have walked
in that bar a few days ago,

47:27.345 --> 47:29.055
heard that Blind Blake song,

47:29.055 --> 47:31.474
probably would've been years
before I found out he was dead.

47:33.685 --> 47:37.063
Well... in spite
of the circumstances...

47:39.732 --> 47:42.485
...it's been nice
getting to know you.

47:42.569 --> 47:45.613
Nice getting to know you, too.

47:45.697 --> 47:48.283
Night, Reacher.

47:52.787 --> 47:54.789
Good night, Roscoe.

48:29.198 --> 48:32.201
You know, before we get into it,
I could use a real breakfast.

48:32.285 --> 48:34.203
That Zagnut ain't cuttin' it.

48:34.287 --> 48:35.955
Should've had the Clark Bar.

48:36.039 --> 48:37.915
Yeah?

49:21.042 --> 49:22.960
All clear.

49:24.837 --> 49:26.214
Clear.

49:27.215 --> 49:30.134
When they came in, they tracked
through the flower bed.

49:30.218 --> 49:31.761
Rubber overshoes.

49:32.762 --> 49:34.681
They were gonna kill me?

49:34.681 --> 49:37.266
Could've been here for me.
My car was parked out front.

49:50.530 --> 49:52.699
Looks like they plan
on coming back.

49:52.699 --> 49:55.076
I'm really gonna need a gun.
