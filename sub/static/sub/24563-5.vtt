Can you save him?

[P.I.X.A.L.]
I've diverted power
to critical life functions.

04:41.846 --> 04:43.979
But Zane will have to do
most of the work.

04:44.066 --> 04:46.764
He must reconfigure his system
and reboot himself.

04:46.851 --> 04:49.071
Isn't there anything we can do?

04:49.158 --> 04:52.814
We have to keep moving, or the
Sons of Garmadon will find us.

04:52.901 --> 04:54.729
They'll do anything
to get their hands on the child.

04:54.816 --> 04:57.340
I just don't get
how a baby can be a key.

04:57.427 --> 04:59.690
I don't either.
But that's what they said.

04:59.777 --> 05:02.519
They called him,
"The Key to the Third Mask."

05:02.606 --> 05:04.956
If Cole's right,
we need to disappear.

Get as far away
from Ninjago City as we can.

Doesn't seem right.

05:10.397 --> 05:11.920
Abandoning Ninjago City.

05:12.007 --> 05:13.661
We're not abandoning.

05:13.748 --> 05:15.358
There are others
who will protect her.

Give him some milk.

I tried. He doesn't like milk.

05:40.949 --> 05:42.298
What else do babies drink?

05:42.385 --> 05:44.387
Don't ask me. Ask him.

05:44.474 --> 05:47.085
He's a baby! He hasn't
learned how to talk yet.

05:47.172 --> 05:48.652
Oh, maybe he needs
a diaper change.

05:48.739 --> 05:51.089
Oh, my gosh.
Do we even have diapers?

We're ninja.

one of our hoods instead.

12:30.097 --> 12:31.402
What are you talking about?

12:31.489 --> 12:32.708
[P.I.X.A.L.]
This would be a good time

12:32.795 --> 12:35.493
to make a minor confession.

12:35.580 --> 12:39.323
I am Samurai X.

12:39.410 --> 12:40.977
- What? Are you serious?
- How is that possible?

12:41.064 --> 12:42.631
How can you be Samurai X?

12:42.718 --> 12:43.850
Totally called it.

12:43.937 --> 12:45.939
- You did not.
- Did too.

12:47.375 --> 12:49.290
boom

12:50.117 --> 12:52.119
[rumbling]

12:52.206 --> 12:54.643
[powering down]

12:54.730 --> 12:57.428
We probably needed that, right?

12:57.515 --> 12:58.952
[baby crying]

12:59.039 --> 13:01.693
The neck is targeting
the second thruster.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.391
Lloyd, if we lose the second--

13:03.478 --> 13:04.696
I know, I know.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.698
We'll drop out of the sky
like a brick.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.570
Nya, try to find
the foreign agent.

13:08.657 --> 13:10.572
Jay, keep that lightning
off our back.

13:10.659 --> 13:13.270
The rest of us,
get ready to fight.

13:13.357 --> 13:15.229
[intense music]

13:17.753 --> 13:18.972
Stay safe, little buddy.

13:19.059 --> 13:20.147
I'll be back to get you

13:20.234 --> 13:22.236
before you know it.

13:22.323 --> 13:24.194
[rain pattering]

13:26.980 --> 13:28.633
[rumbling]

13:31.114 --> 13:32.812
Everyone, be on alert.

13:32.899 --> 13:35.075
[thunder rumbling]

13:35.162 --> 13:37.817
That lightning is getting
way too close for comfort.

13:37.904 --> 13:40.645
- Jay, try to hold them off.
- Got it.

13:40.732 --> 13:41.821
[grunting]

13:42.865 --> 13:43.953
[crackling]
Whoo!

13:45.825 --> 13:47.478
Uh, you're welcome.

13:47.565 --> 13:49.480
[whooshing]

13:51.047 --> 13:52.919
boom

13:53.006 --> 13:54.616
There!

13:54.703 --> 13:56.313
Can't see a thing in this storm.

13:56.400 --> 13:58.359
Time to light this place up.

13:58.446 --> 14:00.361
[grunting]

14:04.234 --> 14:05.670
Harumi, stand back
and take this.

14:05.757 --> 14:07.368
But I don't know how to fight.

14:07.455 --> 14:09.326
But you want to live, right?

14:10.850 --> 14:11.807
There!

14:11.894 --> 14:13.200
whoosh

14:22.339 --> 14:23.863
[clattering]

14:39.704 --> 14:41.097
[static crackling]

14:55.024 --> 14:56.634
[intense music]

14:56.721 --> 14:58.636
[screaming]

15:03.337 --> 15:05.208
[groaning]

15:12.650 --> 15:14.000
Don't let her get the thruster.

15:14.087 --> 15:15.653
Yeah.

15:15.740 --> 15:17.046
[screams]

15:19.266 --> 15:21.137
[grunting]

15:24.749 --> 15:25.794
[groans]

15:25.881 --> 15:27.796
[whirring]

15:30.103 --> 15:31.974
[grunting]

15:34.194 --> 15:35.456
[thunder rumbling]

15:42.724 --> 15:44.030
[clinks]

15:47.207 --> 15:49.426
[gasping]
Lloyd!

15:49.513 --> 15:51.385
[thunder rumbling]

15:52.603 --> 15:54.344
Harumi!

15:55.606 --> 15:57.521
[intense music]

16:06.922 --> 16:08.228
whoosh

16:10.447 --> 16:12.667
- He did not just--
- He just did.

16:13.581 --> 16:14.712
[grunts]

16:16.453 --> 16:18.455
P.I.X.A.L.,
you have to stop this.

16:18.542 --> 16:19.935
There is no P.I.X.A.L.

16:20.022 --> 16:21.632
Only The Quiet One.

16:21.719 --> 16:23.547
I am sorry about this

16:23.634 --> 16:27.203
but you're gonna set me
in the right frame of mind.

16:27.290 --> 16:28.509
Whoa!

16:28.596 --> 16:30.946
[crackling]

16:35.820 --> 16:37.997
I did not think that through.

16:38.084 --> 16:39.999
[screaming]

16:46.440 --> 16:48.311
You're supposed
to be our friend!

16:48.398 --> 16:49.921
[grunting]

16:50.009 --> 16:51.488
[Harumi screams]

16:53.229 --> 16:54.448
We're, we're gonna--

16:54.535 --> 16:56.493
Look at me.
We're gonna get out of this.

16:56.580 --> 16:57.929
You hear me?

16:58.017 --> 16:59.931
[music continues]

17:03.413 --> 17:06.286
The map. Maybe we can use it
to parachute down.

17:06.373 --> 17:09.202
What is this, a cartoon?
That's never gonna work.

17:09.289 --> 17:11.160
[Harumi screaming]

17:15.469 --> 17:17.340
The suit should break your fall.

17:17.427 --> 17:19.212
What? No. What about you?

17:19.299 --> 17:20.604
Sorry. Only room for one.

17:20.691 --> 17:22.389
No. I need you.

17:22.476 --> 17:24.173
And I need that map.

17:27.785 --> 17:29.222
[screaming]

17:29.309 --> 17:31.180
I didn't think
this through either.

17:33.704 --> 17:35.619
[screaming]

17:40.798 --> 17:42.670
[groans]

17:42.757 --> 17:44.846
[screaming]

17:44.933 --> 17:46.674
[groaning]

17:49.981 --> 17:51.461
[intense music]

17:51.548 --> 17:53.811
[grunting]
Get off me!

17:53.898 --> 17:55.639
Get off!

17:55.726 --> 17:57.598
[screaming]

17:58.381 --> 18:00.340
[squealing]

18:00.427 --> 18:02.255
What in the name of Ninjago

18:02.342 --> 18:03.908
was happening around here?

18:03.995 --> 18:05.519
[panting]

18:05.606 --> 18:07.173
P.I.X.A.L.

18:07.260 --> 18:09.349
'You kind of missed a lot.'

18:09.436 --> 18:11.655
[P.I.X.A.L.]
Foreign agent has been purged
from my system.

18:11.742 --> 18:14.223
Commencing system reboot
in 30 seconds.

18:14.310 --> 18:16.138
[intense music]

18:16.225 --> 18:17.531
[grunting]

18:28.977 --> 18:31.545
Drop your sword!

18:31.632 --> 18:34.330
I shall comply.

18:38.726 --> 18:41.555
[P.I.X.A.L.]
Reboot complete. Systems online.

18:41.642 --> 18:43.513
[music continues]

18:50.564 --> 18:53.044
boom

18:53.132 --> 18:55.046
[all screaming]

18:59.964 --> 19:01.705
[grunts]
She got the last thruster.

19:01.792 --> 19:04.012
- Uh! You got any ideas?
- Not a one.

19:04.099 --> 19:05.883
- Yeah, me neither.
- Where do I..

19:05.970 --> 19:07.929
That is not helpful.

19:08.016 --> 19:10.149
Perhaps if we could
reel in those dragon sails

19:10.236 --> 19:12.281
we maybe able to achieve
a controlled crash.

19:12.368 --> 19:13.674
What sails?

19:19.245 --> 19:21.856
The rain.
It could slow our fall.

19:21.943 --> 19:23.466
It's worth a try.

19:23.553 --> 19:25.294
[intense music]

19:26.687 --> 19:28.210
[grunts]

19:41.223 --> 19:42.485
[grunting]

19:42.572 --> 19:44.444
[instrumental music]

19:46.054 --> 19:47.969
[whooshing]

19:53.975 --> 19:56.586
Yes! It's working! Huh?

20:02.331 --> 20:03.898
Brace for impact!

20:05.639 --> 20:07.510
[baby crying]

20:20.131 --> 20:22.046
[all screaming]

20:34.494 --> 20:36.539
[instrumental music]

20:36.626 --> 20:38.498
[all groaning]

20:41.588 --> 20:43.546
Everyone okay?

20:43.633 --> 20:46.332
[groaning]

20:46.419 --> 20:48.247
You okay too, little buddy?

20:48.334 --> 20:50.118
[babbles]

20:50.205 --> 20:51.511
[Samurai X]
'Zane.'

20:55.428 --> 20:58.039
All this time, it was you.

20:58.126 --> 20:59.736
Why didn't you tell me?

20:59.823 --> 21:01.738
I had to keep
my identity a secret

21:01.825 --> 21:03.740
to protect those I cared about.

21:03.827 --> 21:05.568
You don't have to lie to me.

21:05.655 --> 21:08.092
You didn't like being stuck
in my head.

21:08.179 --> 21:09.616
There was that too.

21:09.703 --> 21:12.401
From now on, no more secrets.

21:15.709 --> 21:17.580
What about Lloyd and Harumi?

21:25.588 --> 21:27.286
- Ow!
- There.

21:30.376 --> 21:33.466
I think we're on our own.

21:46.348 --> 21:48.263
[theme music]
