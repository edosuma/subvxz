00:29.112 --> 00:32.991
BASED ON A SPACE EPOS
BY HARRY MARTINSON

01:53.321 --> 01:55.657
No!
- He'll be here later.

01:55.865 --> 01:57.265
No.

01:58.743 --> 02:02.122
Want to wave goodbye to Earth?
- No.

02:02.831 --> 02:04.582
You'll regret it if you don't.

02:05.959 --> 02:07.877
Want to say bye-bye to Earth?

02:08.086 --> 02:10.588
Bye-bye, Earth.
- Bye-bye...

02:39.743 --> 02:42.537
We will now begin
docking with Aniara.

02:42.746 --> 02:46.291
Please remain with your belts
fastened until the gangway is ready

02:46.499 --> 02:48.585
and the seat-belt sign
is switched off.

02:49.127 --> 02:51.004
Please note that checked containers

02:51.254 --> 02:53.298
will not be available
during the voyage.

02:53.673 --> 02:55.759
We hope you've had a pleasant ascent

02:55.967 --> 02:59.471
and wish you a happy,
new life on Mars.

03:09.147 --> 03:10.565
Excuse me, I work here.

03:37.300 --> 03:38.700
Hi.

03:52.315 --> 03:54.442
FOREBODY

06:05.573 --> 06:07.909
Welcome aboard Aniara.

06:08.785 --> 06:11.246
A state-of-the-art transport ship

06:11.413 --> 06:15.208
which will take you all the way
from Earth to Mars in three weeks.

06:15.333 --> 06:16.733
ASTRONOMER

06:17.419 --> 06:21.715
The air we breathe on the craft
is completely natural.

06:21.923 --> 06:24.843
It derives from our extensive
algae farms.

06:25.093 --> 06:27.178
And our 21 restaurants...

06:31.266 --> 06:33.518
also feature a spa,
a tanning salon...

06:37.063 --> 06:39.774
You'll want for nothing.

06:42.944 --> 06:44.487
As we enter our set course,

06:44.738 --> 06:47.115
please lie down
with your seat belts fastened

06:47.282 --> 06:50.035
until the gravitational load
has adapted to our cruising speed.

06:50.160 --> 06:52.579
All communication systems
will be down

06:52.746 --> 06:54.956
until we've reached our destination.

06:57.667 --> 06:59.067
Hi!
- Hi.

06:59.210 --> 07:01.421
So you're in my room now?
- Yes, here I am.

07:02.547 --> 07:04.799
Served my whole life.
Still have to bunk.

07:05.884 --> 07:07.844
That's how they treat
astronomers here.

07:09.220 --> 07:10.263
Yes.

07:10.638 --> 07:13.975
Leave people behind on Earth instead
so I can have my own closet.

07:14.184 --> 07:16.644
I don't care if they melt
into the tarmac.

07:16.853 --> 07:19.064
I was only kidding.
- I wasn't.

07:19.689 --> 07:22.025
I've never been very impressed
by people.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.319
Sorry to hear that, but...

07:25.487 --> 07:26.905
you sure seem to enjoy books.

07:27.906 --> 07:29.324
I took the top shelves.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.535
I hope you don't snore?
- No.

07:36.122 --> 07:38.958
Or, a little, maybe.

07:39.876 --> 07:43.546
Then I'll have to change cabins
on the way back.

07:47.092 --> 07:48.492
Goddamn it!

07:55.850 --> 07:58.603
HOUR 1

07:58.770 --> 08:04.025
ROUTINE VOYAGE

08:12.617 --> 08:15.912
This is your Captain Chefone
speaking.

08:16.996 --> 08:20.834
We are now cruising at a speed
of 64 kilometers per second

08:21.084 --> 08:24.796
and are expected to dock
with the space lift Valles Marineris

08:25.005 --> 08:29.509
in 23 days, 7 hours,
and 25 minutes.

08:32.846 --> 08:36.599
It's a pressure suit.
- Not exactly designer stuff.

08:37.225 --> 08:41.895
I guess these are all you have,
so I'd like a size 104.

08:42.397 --> 08:44.190
Please wrap it for me...

08:53.408 --> 08:56.202
Mima Hall introduction?
- I'm good, thanks.

08:57.370 --> 09:00.373
Care to do the Mima Hall
introduction, starting now?

09:00.999 --> 09:01.958
No, thanks.

09:02.167 --> 09:05.670
Okay then. Might as well get started.

09:06.254 --> 09:10.050
I'm called MR.
I work as a Mimarobe here on Aniara.

09:11.259 --> 09:12.260
Quick back story:

09:12.469 --> 09:14.512
Mima was originally created

09:14.721 --> 09:17.349
for the first settlers
on Mars, who...

09:19.934 --> 09:26.358
Simply put, she transports us
back to Earth as it once was.

09:28.777 --> 09:32.197
Right, shall we?
Let's go inside.

10:02.727 --> 10:06.856
If you tilt your head down.
No one else do it.

10:07.899 --> 10:10.193
You can tell,
it gets more intense.

10:12.237 --> 10:13.780
Is it okay if I have a look?

10:30.714 --> 10:32.114
And look up.

10:36.428 --> 10:38.930
What you see is personal to you,

10:39.264 --> 10:42.058
since Mima has access
to your memory banks.

10:44.561 --> 10:48.148
Now, let me explain
how to use this space.

10:48.648 --> 10:51.651
Once you go into the images,
you won't feel your...

11:01.786 --> 11:03.186
Stabilization initiated!

11:03.371 --> 11:05.081
Two, one...

11:06.291 --> 11:08.293
We've got protruding sections
by the Saba reactor.

11:08.418 --> 11:09.878
Stand by for cooling results.

11:10.003 --> 11:12.088
Passing field SARI-17!
- Return to course.

11:13.340 --> 11:14.758
Hondo, initiate course return.

11:15.967 --> 11:17.135
Hondo!

11:17.344 --> 11:22.223
Captain, initiating course return.
Field egress ICE-12.

11:32.442 --> 11:33.842
What's happening?

11:34.819 --> 11:36.237
Not sure, but don't worry.

11:36.446 --> 11:39.407
Why don't you lie down
on the Mima pillow.

11:40.367 --> 11:42.952
You can lie here
for as long as you want.

12:01.429 --> 12:03.056
What happened?
- No idea.

12:07.519 --> 12:09.396
Nuclear fuel ejected.
- Good.

12:09.813 --> 12:12.982
Status on the back-up system?
- Techs are working on it.

12:14.150 --> 12:16.528
Copy that.
Isagel, course?

12:17.737 --> 12:21.950
Field SARI-16, angle YKO-9.
Lyra constellation ahead.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.143
Copy that.

12:30.583 --> 12:33.169
Just keep still!
Everything is under control.

12:39.050 --> 12:41.928
Nobody move.
Just keep still.

12:44.347 --> 12:45.747
Now, all is in order.

12:59.320 --> 13:00.720
Need help?

13:04.743 --> 13:06.828
IMPORTANT INFORMATION
FROM CAPTAIN CHEFONE

13:06.953 --> 13:08.788
We will soon be going live

13:09.039 --> 13:11.708
with Captain Chefone
from the Light-year Hall.

13:12.834 --> 13:18.006
The broadcast will also be delivered
across all audiovisual devices.

13:34.939 --> 13:37.442
Excuse me, could you scooch over?

14:09.224 --> 14:11.851
Good evening, dear passengers.

14:14.145 --> 14:16.981
We've had an incident,
and I understand your concern.

14:19.067 --> 14:20.527
Let me get straight to it.

14:22.570 --> 14:26.282
Something highly unlikely
has occurred.

14:28.159 --> 14:30.286
We had to make an emergency maneuver

14:30.578 --> 14:33.123
to avoid a collision
with space debris.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.501
It saved our lives.

14:38.044 --> 14:39.587
But our reactor took a hit,

14:39.796 --> 14:42.298
as a screw penetrated the hull.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.010
The power station caught fire

14:45.385 --> 14:49.347
and we had no choice
but to eject all our fuel.

14:53.560 --> 14:57.480
This unfortunately means
we can no longer steer Aniara.

14:58.690 --> 15:02.902
We've been knocked off-course
and cannot turn back.

15:05.030 --> 15:07.490
But... you can remain calm.

15:08.616 --> 15:10.285
Once we pass a celestial body

15:10.452 --> 15:13.913
we'll use its gravity
to get back on course.

15:16.499 --> 15:19.544
I can't tell you exactly
when this will happen.

15:20.795 --> 15:24.257
But you should prepare for the fact
that it could be a couple...

15:24.966 --> 15:26.634
Definitely no more than two years.

15:31.431 --> 15:35.602
Hey. Excuse me?
It was supposed to take three weeks.

15:35.977 --> 15:39.230
I'm afraid things have changed.
Listen to the captain now.

15:39.439 --> 15:44.569
That's not possible. I told my son
I'd be there for his fourth birthday.

15:44.778 --> 15:47.364
You will of course be duly
compensated upon arrival.

15:47.822 --> 15:51.951
But for now we need to cooperate
and be there for one another.

15:52.994 --> 15:55.705
Remember we have much
to be grateful for.

15:56.122 --> 15:58.958
No one was hurt,
and our voyage is still ahead of us.

15:59.668 --> 16:01.419
In that sense, we've been lucky.

16:04.631 --> 16:06.031
Come.

16:08.343 --> 16:09.743
Come here.

16:12.222 --> 16:17.018
Was her name Chebeba?
- No, that's me. Her name is Libidel.

16:21.106 --> 16:25.652
Libidel? Listen to me.
Just let the images come to you.

16:25.860 --> 16:28.571
Tilt your head down
and they'll come at once.

16:30.448 --> 16:31.848
Breathe slowly.

16:51.136 --> 16:53.388
Lie down here.
That's it...

17:06.151 --> 17:09.279
I'll let you know as soon
as I have more information.

17:09.487 --> 17:12.741
In the meantime, help yourself
to a night snack from the management.

17:13.074 --> 17:15.993
Have some snacks,
courtesy of the captain.

17:18.704 --> 17:22.709
How soon can we increase algae
production to cover our food needs?

17:22.916 --> 17:26.087
Immediately. It won't burden
the oxygen system.

17:26.796 --> 17:30.300
Restaurants? How long can we last?
When do we run out of supplies?

17:30.467 --> 17:34.721
It depends, but in two months
we'll start noticing a difference.

17:34.971 --> 17:38.016
Including the algae?
- We can survive on it.

17:38.224 --> 17:39.934
But it's not exactly tasty.

17:57.118 --> 17:58.518
How are you?

17:59.954 --> 18:03.625
Good.
- Nice repression.

18:08.421 --> 18:10.507
I don't really have anyone
waiting for me...

18:14.094 --> 18:16.596
No family?
- No. None still living.

18:20.225 --> 18:21.625
You've got Mima.

18:24.187 --> 18:27.440
Is anyone waiting for you?
- I'm separated.

18:28.692 --> 18:32.028
After 31 years, in total.
- Shit!

18:32.320 --> 18:35.073
What?
- I'm sorry! It just sounds so...

18:35.782 --> 18:36.825
long.

18:37.033 --> 18:40.370
Of course, 31 years is a long time
in a human life span.

18:40.829 --> 18:43.206
How come it ended?
- I don't know.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.959
It's so hard to tell
when you're involved.

18:48.003 --> 18:49.421
You're right about that.

18:49.963 --> 18:53.258
You usually need to view it
from a distance.

18:54.884 --> 18:56.396
Guess I'll be able to do that now.

18:57.262 --> 19:00.223
So check back with me
in a few years' time.

19:06.438 --> 19:10.191
WEEK 3

19:10.358 --> 19:16.031
WITHOUT A MAP

19:38.136 --> 19:41.514
Excuse me. Where can I
find the Mima Hall?

19:41.931 --> 19:45.393
Once you're inside the images,
you won't feel your body.

19:45.602 --> 19:49.689
That's why you need to lie
on one of these.

19:49.898 --> 19:51.649
Then you can spend hours in here.

19:54.027 --> 19:56.696
Hey! You can't come in here!
I'll be right back.

19:57.405 --> 20:00.867
No shoes in here! You need
to take the introduction first.

20:01.326 --> 20:02.726
I'm sorry.

20:06.122 --> 20:10.085
There we go. Lie down,
face down and just relax.

20:12.545 --> 20:16.132
Now you lie down as well.
Let me take your glasses.

20:41.408 --> 20:43.493
I need to speak to the captain.

20:44.035 --> 20:45.537
He's busy.
What's it about?

20:45.704 --> 20:47.706
This past week
I've had more visitors

20:47.914 --> 20:50.750
than I usually get
for an entire trip.

20:52.002 --> 20:54.421
I need help.
- I'll pass it on.

20:54.629 --> 20:56.715
They need training too.
- I'll write that down.

20:57.007 --> 21:00.593
Do you know how long it'll be
before we can... turn around?

21:44.387 --> 21:47.265
You can't sleep either?
- No.

22:07.243 --> 22:08.643
Sorry!

22:53.206 --> 22:55.125
Can I ask you something,
as an astronomer?

22:55.500 --> 22:56.900
Ask away.

22:57.836 --> 22:59.087
Do you have any idea

22:59.212 --> 23:01.840
which celestial body
we'll be able to turn at?

23:06.636 --> 23:08.036
What did you say?

23:08.179 --> 23:09.597
I didn't say anything.

23:10.265 --> 23:13.518
Because I'm not...
anticipating anything.

23:14.853 --> 23:17.063
Okay. I thought you knew
about that stuff.

23:17.605 --> 23:19.065
I do know about that stuff.

23:20.191 --> 23:21.860
The answer is, "none."

23:22.068 --> 23:24.571
None?
- No.

23:26.406 --> 23:27.323
What?!

23:27.449 --> 23:29.117
There's no celestial body to turn at.

23:31.036 --> 23:32.245
You're kidding?

23:32.454 --> 23:37.584
GM-54 is the closest we'll get to.
But we'll never reach its mass.

23:40.253 --> 23:42.547
The pilots must have figured
that out too.

23:43.798 --> 23:46.198
I don't get what they're doing
on the captain's bridge.

23:49.763 --> 23:51.163
Will you turn off the light?

24:03.526 --> 24:05.111
Turn off the light, please.

26:59.327 --> 27:02.163
Is he okay?
- It looked quite brutal to us...

27:06.418 --> 27:08.378
Let him out!
- Can I get by?

27:08.586 --> 27:10.839
I work here. Excuse me.

27:13.550 --> 27:15.510
It's some kind of panic attack
or psychosis.

27:17.053 --> 27:18.453
Hi.

27:19.764 --> 27:22.851
I work as a Mimarobe,
I'd like you to come with me.

27:26.146 --> 27:28.023
He's asking if you're a devil?

27:32.527 --> 27:34.738
A woman at the Planetarium told him

27:34.946 --> 27:36.823
she's an astronomer and she knows...

27:41.202 --> 27:43.413
She says we won't be able
to turn around.

27:44.289 --> 27:45.689
No, that's not true.

27:51.671 --> 27:53.071
Tell him...

27:54.841 --> 27:58.011
Tell him to come with me,
I promise he'll feel better.

28:07.437 --> 28:11.024
What do you think life on Mars is?
Some kind of paradise?

28:12.025 --> 28:13.425
It's not.

28:14.319 --> 28:15.278
It's cold.

28:15.612 --> 28:18.948
Nothing grows except for a small
frost-proof tulip, this small.

28:20.241 --> 28:23.036
Want me to translate?

28:27.457 --> 28:31.002
Just say we may as well live here.

29:01.408 --> 29:03.076
Further in. This way.

29:09.165 --> 29:11.751
You need to put your head down.
Put it down.

29:21.136 --> 29:22.536
There.

29:31.104 --> 29:32.981
You'll have to come back
another time.

29:33.857 --> 29:35.257
No!

29:45.660 --> 29:48.788
I really need some help.
This is untenable.

29:49.122 --> 29:50.522
I need to train them as well.

29:50.665 --> 29:54.419
Teach them to resist the images
to maintain focus in the room.

29:55.170 --> 29:56.796
Sounds reasonable.

29:57.797 --> 29:59.007
How many do you need?

29:59.257 --> 30:01.134
How many...?
- To help you out.

30:01.468 --> 30:03.887
Right... five? Six.

30:05.513 --> 30:08.516
People will freak out when they learn
we'll never be able to...

30:09.351 --> 30:10.769
Never be able to do what?

30:15.732 --> 30:17.132
Who told you that?

30:28.244 --> 30:31.289
Right, I'll get you
at least eight people.

30:32.165 --> 30:33.958
Thanks.
- Good.

30:37.337 --> 30:41.174
Once the passengers get used
to eating algae,

30:41.633 --> 30:43.218
we'll go public with the situation.

30:43.468 --> 30:45.303
I mean, the fact is...

30:48.306 --> 30:49.706
The fact is what?

30:50.058 --> 30:52.060
We've built our own little planet.

30:56.231 --> 31:00.485
YEAR 3

31:00.652 --> 31:05.407
THE YURG

32:32.869 --> 32:34.269
What's your name?

32:36.081 --> 32:37.665
What's that?
- Daisi!

32:55.850 --> 32:57.435
Come on, don't be so lori.

32:58.978 --> 33:00.772
Lori?
- Don't get all gammed down.

33:13.660 --> 33:15.060
What?

33:15.704 --> 33:17.104
Finish yourself off!

33:22.085 --> 33:25.588
An important message
for all passengers.

33:25.797 --> 33:27.632
Right now we're offering
double points

33:27.799 --> 33:30.719
for new algae-plant employees.

33:31.011 --> 33:33.513
Sign up for duty
at your nearest desk.

33:36.057 --> 33:37.457
Nasty.

33:37.642 --> 33:39.042
Sulfate?

33:40.895 --> 33:42.647
I don't smell anything.
- It stinks.

33:44.357 --> 33:46.484
We need more people
on the water purification plant.

33:46.609 --> 33:48.028
Copy that.
- Shit!

33:48.236 --> 33:49.738
This is not good.
- No.

33:52.365 --> 33:56.578
All the food we eat on the craft
comes from here.

33:56.786 --> 33:58.186
Come in.

33:59.581 --> 34:00.981
Keep walking.

34:02.417 --> 34:04.169
Look at that beautiful color.

34:05.170 --> 34:08.465
If it's brown, it's no good.
It must be washed.

34:09.632 --> 34:12.217
Shall we continue into the next room?

34:13.719 --> 34:16.139
See? This is good stuff.

34:16.348 --> 34:19.516
The only hard thing about this job
is getting up in the morning.

34:27.609 --> 34:29.485
Thank you.
- Thank you.

34:31.029 --> 34:33.156
Thank you.
- Thank you. See you tomorrow.

34:37.202 --> 34:40.871
Beautiful.
- It's a tree, a duck, and a sea.

34:41.331 --> 34:43.375
You think I could stay
a little longer?

34:43.583 --> 34:44.751
I'm afraid not.

34:45.001 --> 34:47.545
What if I transfer points
to your card?

34:47.962 --> 34:51.382
No, sorry. Come back tomorrow!
- It's like that?

34:52.717 --> 34:54.386
Fine then...
- Thank you.

35:31.339 --> 35:32.739
Thank you.
- Sure.

35:40.890 --> 35:42.290
Wait!

35:44.853 --> 35:47.022
The guy you saw me with
this morning...

35:47.772 --> 35:49.172
It meant nothing.

35:53.153 --> 35:54.553
Just so you know.

36:05.206 --> 36:08.877
There's much to be ashamed of
in life, but that's nothing.

36:09.294 --> 36:12.922
I don't get her!
It's like she has no emotions.

36:13.423 --> 36:15.884
You need to understand,
that's how pilots are.

36:16.509 --> 36:19.346
They're a new kind of fatalists.
- What?

36:19.679 --> 36:22.265
They're experts at repressing
their emotions.

36:24.851 --> 36:26.251
Isagel...

36:26.853 --> 36:28.730
represses her feelings!

36:29.981 --> 36:32.108
The utter nonsense of living.

36:32.317 --> 36:34.444
What? Being in love is nonsense?

36:34.944 --> 36:38.865
It's all so peripheral,
what we're doing.

36:39.741 --> 36:42.452
It's so futile, so meaningless.

36:45.497 --> 36:47.457
You see this bubble?

36:49.125 --> 36:52.629
If you think of it as Aniara,

36:53.046 --> 36:57.008
maybe you'll understand
the vastness of space.

36:57.217 --> 37:01.429
You see, the bubble actually
moves through the glass.

37:01.638 --> 37:03.890
Infinitely slowly.

37:05.517 --> 37:08.019
We move forward in the same way

37:08.895 --> 37:12.273
Even if we drift
at an incredible speed,

37:13.608 --> 37:16.069
it's as if were standing
perfectly still.

37:19.531 --> 37:23.785
That's us: a little bubble
in the glass of Godhead.

38:45.283 --> 38:46.683
Welcome.

38:47.035 --> 38:48.703
Good morning.
- Good morning.

38:53.249 --> 38:54.649
Welcome!

39:28.159 --> 39:29.559
What are you doing?

39:33.415 --> 39:37.627
Three-VEB is fighting
a cloud of shame.

39:39.129 --> 39:43.133
How terror blasts in,
how horror blasts out.

39:44.634 --> 39:47.053
Deliver me from the vision.

40:19.669 --> 40:21.296
There. It's okay.

41:12.222 --> 41:17.102
I'm sorry, I'm going to have
to close early today.

41:20.814 --> 41:22.524
You can't just send us away...

41:24.442 --> 41:26.653
What's going on?
- She's sending us away!

41:26.861 --> 41:28.571
We're not allowed in there.

41:32.867 --> 41:34.267
Everybody back up.

41:39.624 --> 41:41.167
What do you think you're doing?

41:43.461 --> 41:45.630
Sit. Sit down!

41:47.007 --> 41:49.342
How can you throw people
out of the Mima Hall?

41:49.592 --> 41:50.992
Mima needs to rest.

41:51.136 --> 41:53.680
How do you know?
- She tells me.

41:54.889 --> 41:56.057
She tells you?
- Yes.

41:56.307 --> 41:59.227
And that she reduces herself
to human speech is worrying.

41:59.728 --> 42:01.563
She sees everyone's memories,

42:01.813 --> 42:04.213
what they've been through...
- I know how a Mima works.

42:04.733 --> 42:09.529
Right, but people are starting
to see awful things.

42:09.779 --> 42:11.698
I need to close up for a week,

42:11.865 --> 42:14.034
preferably a month.
- That's too rash.

42:14.451 --> 42:16.286
We've got a system in place
that works.

42:16.536 --> 42:18.872
People go to work,
most of them contribute...

42:19.039 --> 42:22.459
So we're not changing things
or dictating over Mima images!

42:23.209 --> 42:25.128
Right?
- It's untenable.

42:30.216 --> 42:31.616
Get out of here.

42:32.886 --> 42:34.286
Get out!

42:37.349 --> 42:42.645
My conscience aches
for the stones...

42:44.314 --> 42:47.400
I've heard them cry
their stonely cries,

42:47.984 --> 42:52.614
seen the granites
white-hot weeping...

42:53.114 --> 42:54.514
Do you understand?

42:55.325 --> 42:58.745
I've been troubled by their pains.

43:00.372 --> 43:03.750
In the name of Things,
I want peace.

43:05.335 --> 43:08.171
I will be done with my displays.

43:13.176 --> 43:16.680
There is protection
from nearly everything...

43:17.847 --> 43:21.267
Stop! You can't be in here!
Stop!

43:22.852 --> 43:25.689
But there is no protection
from mankind.

43:25.897 --> 43:27.297
Get out!

43:29.567 --> 43:31.569
Get out!
Get out, you can't be in here!

43:32.529 --> 43:35.782
Prolonging the very second
when you burst.

43:36.408 --> 43:41.037
How terror blasts in,
how horror blast out.

43:41.413 --> 43:42.414
Mima!

43:42.622 --> 43:45.875
How grim it always is,
one's detonation.

43:46.084 --> 43:47.484
No!

45:40.031 --> 45:41.491
Unbelievable...

45:42.909 --> 45:44.828
The Mimarobe stayed
in there at night

45:45.120 --> 45:47.122
and kept Mima all to herself.

45:48.248 --> 45:49.666
How dare she?

45:51.876 --> 45:53.461
Has Isagel been here?

45:55.714 --> 45:57.757
I ran into her out in the corridor.

45:58.717 --> 46:00.117
I need to get back.

46:00.510 --> 46:03.680
Rumor has it you will be punished.

46:06.057 --> 46:07.457
Punished?
- Yes.

46:20.030 --> 46:24.534
You can't blame the Mimarobe.
It's not her fault.

46:27.370 --> 46:28.413
Two things.

46:28.872 --> 46:30.999
One: we can do whatever we want.

46:31.332 --> 46:34.461
Two: she's gotten
a number of complaints.

46:35.295 --> 46:36.296
What has she done?

46:36.504 --> 46:41.259
She's been locking herself
in the hall to sabotage Mima.

46:41.468 --> 46:42.969
You know that's not true.

46:45.764 --> 46:47.676
I don't think I've ever
seen you this upset.

46:47.807 --> 46:50.296
Nice to see you've got a little heart
beating in there...

46:56.316 --> 46:57.716
Stop her!

47:08.036 --> 47:09.704
We're headed for her cabin now.

47:11.664 --> 47:13.083
It's 3151.

47:15.752 --> 47:18.380
Hey! We want to talk to you!

47:18.588 --> 47:21.132
What are you doing?
Stop! Stop!

47:41.653 --> 47:43.446
Emergency stop is activated.

47:44.656 --> 47:47.826
The operator has been notified
and will arrive shortly.

50:03.044 --> 50:06.840
YEAR 4

50:07.007 --> 50:12.220
THE CULTS

50:14.848 --> 50:18.601
Come closer. Give us light.

50:19.352 --> 50:22.772
Come closer. Give us light.

50:23.732 --> 50:27.360
Come closer. Give us light.

50:28.278 --> 50:31.823
Come closer. Give us light...

50:49.507 --> 50:51.468
He does not, and I quote,

50:52.177 --> 50:55.263
"want his body to be buried
in the Light-year grave."

50:58.600 --> 51:00.000
What exactly does that mean?

51:01.686 --> 51:03.313
Seems he was frightened of space.

51:03.688 --> 51:06.524
What's the suicide count?
- Forty-eight.

51:08.151 --> 51:10.153
Forty-eight this month?
- Yes.

51:10.737 --> 51:13.823
That includes the family in 32?
- Yes.

51:20.872 --> 51:22.272
You.

51:24.292 --> 51:25.692
You.

51:31.049 --> 51:32.449
You.

51:34.803 --> 51:36.203
You.

51:38.181 --> 51:39.581
You...

51:40.183 --> 51:41.583
and you.

51:44.854 --> 51:46.254
Let's go!

51:52.529 --> 51:57.283
Come on. Go inside.
Get in, get in!

51:57.867 --> 52:01.037
We're in need of staff.
You'll be reassigned to your jobs.

52:01.579 --> 52:04.749
Algae. Deoxidation. Algae.

52:10.255 --> 52:12.215
You can stay down there, up to you.

52:17.137 --> 52:18.680
Just take it! Come on!

52:19.723 --> 52:21.224
Please, Isagel.

52:24.019 --> 52:25.812
You'll be going back to Logistics.

52:27.188 --> 52:29.190
MR, you're going to teach.

52:29.566 --> 52:33.611
We need to focus on kids
with a talent for tensor theory.

52:36.031 --> 52:38.825
Find the right size uniform.
And make us proud.

53:01.264 --> 53:05.560
How can you even consider
staying down there?

53:07.771 --> 53:11.316
I've got my principles.
- You don't say.

55:05.680 --> 55:10.226
Let's talk about artificial
gravitation. I'm quoting:

55:11.561 --> 55:14.773
"Only with the new era's fifth
tensor theory"

55:15.023 --> 55:17.859
did it become possible
to outsmart gravity.

55:21.404 --> 55:25.492
Previously we had tried shooting
ourselves out of the curve vectors

55:26.076 --> 55:29.704
or, which worked slightly better,
pulsating the spaceships

55:30.080 --> 55:33.041
"out of the fields
using force cadences."

55:43.760 --> 55:46.304
Forgive us! Forgive us!

55:48.181 --> 55:50.809
Forgive us! Forgive us!

55:52.811 --> 55:55.522
Forgive us! Forgive us!

55:56.523 --> 55:57.982
Forgive us...!

56:27.429 --> 56:28.829
I won!

56:37.230 --> 56:38.630
Hello.

56:55.915 --> 56:58.168
Libidel wants you
to carry the lantern.

57:01.296 --> 57:04.132
Libidel and her Libidellas.

57:05.425 --> 57:08.970
Sorry, I didn't get it. What?
- Libidel and her Libidellas...

57:09.679 --> 57:11.389
We're going to canonize Mima.

57:11.598 --> 57:14.559
You what?
- We're going to canonize Mima.

57:15.477 --> 57:18.355
We'll form a choir at her grave.

57:23.026 --> 57:26.363
Then what?
You'll sacrifice me for killing Mima?

57:27.906 --> 57:29.741
Mima killed herself.

57:33.286 --> 57:34.686
She died of grief.

57:37.374 --> 57:38.875
She died of grief.

57:41.544 --> 57:43.088
You have to come with us.

58:38.685 --> 58:43.440
Mima, we pray at your grave.

58:45.400 --> 58:48.945
Mima...
- Our day of days.

01:01:52.754 --> 01:01:56.132
YEAR 5

01:01:56.341 --> 01:02:01.971
THE CALCULATION

01:02:41.511 --> 01:02:42.911
What did you say?

01:02:44.681 --> 01:02:46.349
There are no possibilities...

01:02:49.728 --> 01:02:51.730
There are no possibilities here.

01:02:54.691 --> 01:02:56.276
I'll give birth to a prisoner.

01:02:57.402 --> 01:02:58.802
Why do you say that?

01:03:00.196 --> 01:03:01.596
Because it's true.

01:03:03.450 --> 01:03:05.095
I'll deliver someone
to eternal night.

01:03:05.410 --> 01:03:06.810
It's going to be fine.

01:03:07.704 --> 01:03:11.833
I promise, it's going to be fine.
You'll feel better.

01:03:12.042 --> 01:03:13.710
You can't promise that.
- Yes, I can.

01:03:20.258 --> 01:03:21.968
I'm going to get rid of the darkness.

01:04:10.475 --> 01:04:11.875
What are you doing here?

01:04:13.228 --> 01:04:15.063
Why aren't you with Isagel?

01:04:17.857 --> 01:04:20.276
I said, why aren't you with Isagel?!

01:04:20.860 --> 01:04:22.260
She wants to be alone.

01:04:23.113 --> 01:04:26.533
I'm sneaking into the reception.

01:04:27.325 --> 01:04:29.369
What reception?

01:04:29.953 --> 01:04:32.455
I think it's called "Eternal Spring".

01:04:33.039 --> 01:04:35.834
Want to come?
- Eternal Spring...

01:04:39.379 --> 01:04:42.424
What's the point of it?

01:04:43.925 --> 01:04:45.677
I want to talk to the captain.

01:04:48.304 --> 01:04:50.765
I want to build a beam-screen
outside the windows.

01:04:51.558 --> 01:04:52.976
To escape the darkness.

01:04:55.979 --> 01:04:59.774
You want to build a substitute
for Mima.

01:05:00.442 --> 01:05:04.029
A substitute for the substitute!

01:05:29.554 --> 01:05:32.265
Excuse me. Got a minute?

01:05:34.642 --> 01:05:37.812
It's about a beam-screen.
I'd like to build one.

01:05:38.730 --> 01:05:40.130
Instead of teaching?

01:05:40.982 --> 01:05:43.485
Yes. It would display images,
like Mima.

01:05:44.235 --> 01:05:48.156
But outside the windows,
so we're shielded off from... space.

01:05:48.323 --> 01:05:50.408
You don't grasp how serious this is.

01:05:50.700 --> 01:05:51.743
But I do!

01:05:51.868 --> 01:05:55.413
We must think of future generations.
Make a home for them here.

01:05:55.580 --> 01:05:57.457
Absolutely.
- I guess you want that too?

01:05:57.665 --> 01:06:00.043
Yes, and that's why...
- Then nothing is more important

01:06:00.168 --> 01:06:02.379
than the work you do.

01:06:02.796 --> 01:06:05.423
The kids you teach,
every little piece of shit...

01:06:05.590 --> 01:06:07.092
are our best and brightest.

01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:08.700
Understand?
- Yes...

01:06:10.261 --> 01:06:12.097
I just...
- You won't be allowed

01:06:12.263 --> 01:06:14.474
to build your invention. Okay?

01:06:20.814 --> 01:06:22.214
No!

01:06:23.191 --> 01:06:25.485
I don't want to...
I don't want to!

01:06:26.152 --> 01:06:28.947
I don't want to!
- You're doing great.

01:06:33.451 --> 01:06:34.953
No!

01:06:35.412 --> 01:06:37.497
One more push, Isagel,
and it's over.

01:06:39.374 --> 01:06:41.334
Give it all you've got. Come on!

01:06:49.676 --> 01:06:52.595
Hello! Welcome, little buddy!

01:07:09.738 --> 01:07:11.138
You're so big.

01:07:13.825 --> 01:07:15.225
But you need to sleep!

01:07:22.917 --> 01:07:24.878
You don't need
to keep feeding, right?

01:07:25.337 --> 01:07:26.737
No.

01:07:28.673 --> 01:07:31.885
Look here. Now, it's night!

01:07:34.679 --> 01:07:38.516
Two children play
In a field of wheat

01:07:39.059 --> 01:07:42.270
Play with the thought
That they might with their eyes

01:07:42.854 --> 01:07:45.607
Walk high atop the spikes

01:07:46.316 --> 01:07:48.485
Walking on water is hard...

01:07:48.735 --> 01:07:50.135
Stop singing.

01:07:53.281 --> 01:07:55.992
If you just let
Your eyes wander round

01:07:56.326 --> 01:08:00.914
And allow you to turn
Into a butterfly or a wind

01:08:01.122 --> 01:08:03.416
You'll be able to go...

01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:21.059
But then came Gopta through QWI.

01:08:22.310 --> 01:08:29.024
Without this major discovery
we wouldn't be where we are today.

01:08:49.629 --> 01:08:51.256
Hello, Isagel!

01:09:02.559 --> 01:09:05.060
Here.
- How do I do it?

01:09:10.608 --> 01:09:13.153
Where's Isagel? Tell me!

01:09:13.819 --> 01:09:15.654
She was called up to the bridge.

01:09:16.573 --> 01:09:19.158
How come?
- They've discovered a rescue ship.

01:09:19.367 --> 01:09:20.952
We're being rescued?

01:09:34.799 --> 01:09:37.218
Fourteen arcseconds.
It's moving closer.

01:09:37.426 --> 01:09:38.428
Seventy-six kps.

01:09:38.511 --> 01:09:41.305
How fast was Samara supposed to go?
- Upwards of 73 kps.

01:09:41.473 --> 01:09:42.872
What's going on?

01:09:43.015 --> 01:09:44.416
I've discovered an anomaly

01:09:44.809 --> 01:09:46.810
using one of the star deck
telescopes.

01:09:47.020 --> 01:09:49.439
It displays a clearly deviating
spectral signature.

01:09:50.023 --> 01:09:52.399
It's not big enough
to be a rescue ship.

01:09:53.109 --> 01:09:56.696
It's about 100 meters long,
two meters wide. Linear.

01:09:57.030 --> 01:09:59.157
Then it's probably
a high-speed probe.

01:09:59.366 --> 01:10:00.766
Containing fuel?

01:10:01.576 --> 01:10:03.870
Is it big enough
to contain fuel rods?

01:10:04.621 --> 01:10:06.915
Affirmative.
- Enough to turn the ship around?

01:10:08.291 --> 01:10:09.876
Yes.
- Yes!

01:10:12.045 --> 01:10:14.214
That's amazing!
How far off is it?

01:10:14.422 --> 01:10:15.822
Fourteen months.

01:10:28.186 --> 01:10:29.586
Dear passengers,

01:10:30.355 --> 01:10:34.109
I'm happy to announce help
is finally on the way.

01:10:34.818 --> 01:10:36.945
An emergency fuel probe
is headed our way

01:10:37.112 --> 01:10:39.614
and will be here
in about a year's time.

01:10:40.365 --> 01:10:43.368
Then we can restart the engines
and turn back home.

01:10:44.494 --> 01:10:47.122
Tonight we have every reason
to celebrate.

01:11:11.479 --> 01:11:15.233
YEAR 6

01:11:15.442 --> 01:11:20.655
THE SPEAR

01:11:29.914 --> 01:11:31.958
Let's go, A-6.
Full aperture.

01:11:36.546 --> 01:11:37.946
Nice.

01:11:42.802 --> 01:11:44.202
Focus, A-2.

01:11:49.642 --> 01:11:51.042
Rotate out.

01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:53.920
Rotate out!

01:11:56.941 --> 01:11:58.360
Damn it! What are you doing?

01:11:59.027 --> 01:12:01.613
Want to be stuck here
for the rest of your lives?

01:12:02.238 --> 01:12:03.638
Stop the simulation.

01:12:03.907 --> 01:12:07.202
You just shattered the probe
and tore a hole in the craft.

01:12:07.619 --> 01:12:10.163
We're all dead.
God help us.

01:12:11.790 --> 01:12:14.167
We just need to keep practicing.

01:12:14.584 --> 01:12:17.837
And you're supposed to be our best?
Unbelievable.

01:12:19.422 --> 01:12:22.884
Do it again! Goddamn it!

01:12:42.237 --> 01:12:46.533
Look! It's your favorite Chebeba!

01:12:47.117 --> 01:12:49.619
Not okay to be this late today.
- Sorry.

01:12:52.539 --> 01:12:54.124
Wanna say bye?

01:12:56.584 --> 01:12:59.129
You'll see it grow bigger.
Soon you'll...

01:12:59.421 --> 01:13:00.880
What?
- No Swedish.

01:13:05.635 --> 01:13:08.346
This is your Captain Chefone.

01:13:09.055 --> 01:13:11.850
We will soon begin docking,

01:13:12.058 --> 01:13:15.020
so we ask you
to return to your cabins.

01:13:15.770 --> 01:13:19.441
To slow down the probe,
artificial gravity levels

01:13:19.691 --> 01:13:23.194
may have to be increased
up to seven or 9g.

01:13:31.911 --> 01:13:34.122
Ready for manual increase
in T-minus ten.

01:13:34.539 --> 01:13:37.876
Magnetrons aport,
astern of frame 370 disengaged.

01:13:40.879 --> 01:13:43.923
Three... two... one.

01:13:47.594 --> 01:13:50.180
NG in the stern.

01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:55.000
Point-three...

01:13:55.894 --> 01:13:57.294
five...

01:13:59.481 --> 01:14:00.881
seven...

01:14:04.194 --> 01:14:06.488
Deceleration achieved at 1.7g.

01:14:06.738 --> 01:14:08.406
Neutralizing gravity levels.

01:16:00.977 --> 01:16:03.772
We're only getting a read
on the cosmic radiation.

01:16:06.191 --> 01:16:07.591
Listen up!

01:16:08.068 --> 01:16:11.654
Pack up our analytical instruments,
all of them.

01:16:30.590 --> 01:16:33.093
We need to report to Chefone now.
- Okay.

01:16:35.804 --> 01:16:38.014
You, too! Hey!

01:16:38.765 --> 01:16:41.685
We need to report to the captain.
- Quiet, I'm busy.

01:16:42.102 --> 01:16:45.230
Hello!
- Leave her. She's more useful here.

01:16:52.112 --> 01:16:56.366
Neither the initial spectral analyses

01:16:57.075 --> 01:17:03.289
nor the goptic-STEM could determine
the elemental composition.

01:17:04.207 --> 01:17:05.750
It's not necessarily an issue.

01:17:05.917 --> 01:17:10.547
I mean, our method of measuring
may be... out of date.

01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:14.843
Maybe we shouldn't have said
it's a rescue probe?

01:17:16.428 --> 01:17:19.097
Have you seen
what that information has done?

01:17:21.349 --> 01:17:25.186
How motivated everyone has become.
We should have said it was coming

01:17:25.437 --> 01:17:28.106
long before we even knew
it was coming.

01:17:29.357 --> 01:17:32.485
So we're not ruling out
that it can contain fuel?

01:17:32.777 --> 01:17:34.362
Absolutely not.

01:17:35.488 --> 01:17:39.409
Probably the material itself
can be turned radioactive...

01:17:39.868 --> 01:17:41.745
though we don't know exactly how.

01:17:43.496 --> 01:17:45.081
But we'll find a solution.

01:17:49.502 --> 01:17:50.902
What does the horse say?

01:17:53.214 --> 01:17:54.614
No!

01:17:55.091 --> 01:17:58.553
That's how the horse goes!
Want to go riding?

01:17:59.387 --> 01:18:01.890
Maybe you'll be a jockey one day?
Who knows?

01:18:09.689 --> 01:18:11.089
What does the horse say?

01:18:13.651 --> 01:18:16.237
I don't know.
- What does the horse say?

01:18:24.079 --> 01:18:25.479
No.

01:18:26.456 --> 01:18:28.583
I need to get her home.
- Of course.

01:18:31.586 --> 01:18:33.922
Hello? Time to go home?

01:18:35.298 --> 01:18:37.676
How's his vocabulary coming?

01:18:38.635 --> 01:18:42.013
Is he learning anything?
Has he mentioned spiral galaxies?

01:18:42.263 --> 01:18:44.182
Come on, let's go.
- No. Why?

01:18:44.557 --> 01:18:47.435
We need to get to work
in a few hours. It's important!

01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:51.731
It's a goddamn waste of time.

01:18:52.774 --> 01:18:55.276
Hey! Do you believe in the probe?

01:18:55.944 --> 01:18:59.072
Cut it out! You can't act
like this in public! Come!

01:19:18.383 --> 01:19:20.218
Let's take a 20-minute break.

01:19:23.722 --> 01:19:25.974
In any case,
this is a revolutionary discovery.

01:19:26.891 --> 01:19:30.520
It's a miracle.
If only we could extract some data.

01:19:32.772 --> 01:19:34.941
Did you say it was a miracle?

01:19:36.192 --> 01:19:38.361
Don't you know that "miracle"
and "chance"

01:19:38.528 --> 01:19:40.613
come from the same source?

01:19:40.822 --> 01:19:42.222
Okay, that's great.

01:19:42.532 --> 01:19:46.286
That thing showing up
has nothing to do with us.

01:19:46.703 --> 01:19:49.456
It's chance.
Devoid of any meaning.

01:19:49.664 --> 01:19:51.666
Damn...
- Let's just stop right there!

01:19:51.875 --> 01:19:53.335
Why don't you hit me?

01:19:54.127 --> 01:19:57.672
What's this?
What is this thing?

01:19:57.881 --> 01:19:59.924
You think it'll save you?
- Let go!

01:20:00.216 --> 01:20:01.760
Let go!
- So hit me!

01:20:01.968 --> 01:20:04.346
Tell us what's going on!
- I don't know.

01:20:04.554 --> 01:20:06.181
We demand you tell us!

01:20:07.682 --> 01:20:11.394
Back up! Back up!
- Why haven't we turned around yet?

01:20:11.603 --> 01:20:13.003
Back up!

01:20:17.275 --> 01:20:18.985
It wasn't even cranked up that high!

01:20:19.569 --> 01:20:21.321
I'm burning!
- Back up!

01:20:21.529 --> 01:20:23.782
I'm burning!
- Everybody back up!

01:20:31.956 --> 01:20:33.416
What are you doing?

01:20:37.879 --> 01:20:42.509
You'll be receiving an award
for your discovery tonight.

01:20:43.259 --> 01:20:44.803
Award?

01:20:45.261 --> 01:20:48.807
So you're going to use it as a prize?

01:20:50.183 --> 01:20:52.435
You're not going to spread any fear.

01:20:54.312 --> 01:20:55.712
Listen up!

01:20:56.356 --> 01:20:59.234
We've all had high hopes
for this object.

01:21:00.402 --> 01:21:03.780
And until we have certainty,
we don't say anything.

01:21:04.239 --> 01:21:07.075
The last thing we want
is for people to lose hope.

01:21:07.701 --> 01:21:11.371
So tonight I'll say everything
is going as planned.

01:21:11.913 --> 01:21:15.625
And we'll need to present
a united front. Is that clear?

01:21:20.797 --> 01:21:24.342
We are in a sarcophagus... a coffin.

01:21:24.509 --> 01:21:26.511
That's all we know with certainty.

01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:30.348
I won't have that tone.
- I won't have any hypocrisy.

01:21:31.099 --> 01:21:33.226
You're not spreading
any rumors this time!

01:22:02.422 --> 01:22:03.822
I knew she wrote...

01:22:05.216 --> 01:22:07.135
but not that she wrote poems.

01:22:13.850 --> 01:22:16.061
"We came from Earth,
from Dorisland,"

01:22:17.729 --> 01:22:19.773
the gem in our solar system.

01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:25.362
The only orb where life could grow,

01:22:26.237 --> 01:22:28.198
a land of milk and honey.

01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:32.452
Describe the landscapes
we found there,

01:22:33.495 --> 01:22:35.455
the days which there dawned.

01:22:36.956 --> 01:22:41.670
Describe the man who sewed the garb
for the funeral of his spawn,

01:22:42.796 --> 01:22:45.006
till God and Satan hand in hand

01:22:46.424 --> 01:22:48.635
through a ravaged, poisoned land

01:22:49.928 --> 01:22:52.222
took to hills, fled up and down

01:22:53.473 --> 01:22:55.433
"from man: a king with ashen crown."

01:24:16.431 --> 01:24:18.308
It was during autumn time.

01:24:19.434 --> 01:24:21.353
Stones were glazed.

01:24:22.145 --> 01:24:24.189
All that could burn turned to ash.

01:24:40.372 --> 01:24:41.831
This is our punishment.

01:24:44.292 --> 01:24:46.419
I'm living through my own funeral.

01:24:49.756 --> 01:24:51.712
If you're going to scream,
you need to leave!

01:25:00.266 --> 01:25:01.666
I'm off.

01:25:06.314 --> 01:25:07.899
I don't want to live here.

01:25:09.984 --> 01:25:13.279
Daisi, Daisi Doody!
Don't go!

01:25:14.572 --> 01:25:17.575
Wait, I'm coming with you.
I want to dance!

01:26:29.522 --> 01:26:33.151
Return immediately to your cabins
and fasten your seat belts.

01:26:33.651 --> 01:26:38.156
I repeat.
Return to your cabins immediately.

01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:43.787
Everyone buckle up!
Hurry up! Buckle up!

01:26:43.953 --> 01:26:46.456
Yes, I'm on it.
- What's happening?

01:26:46.706 --> 01:26:49.417
The bow shock is killing
all our equipment.

01:26:49.626 --> 01:26:51.461
Run... birdie!

01:26:52.754 --> 01:26:54.154
I'll handle this.

01:27:32.002 --> 01:27:33.402
Isagel!

01:27:39.676 --> 01:27:41.076
I'm so sorry!

01:27:44.305 --> 01:27:45.890
She calls out to me.

01:27:49.394 --> 01:27:50.794
Who?

01:27:52.355 --> 01:27:56.151
She cries out to me,
but she calls me by another name.

01:28:00.989 --> 01:28:02.389
Listen to me, Isagel.

01:28:02.824 --> 01:28:05.702
You're high. But you'll come down.

01:28:09.039 --> 01:28:10.439
Mama.

01:28:11.666 --> 01:28:13.066
Hi!

01:28:23.845 --> 01:28:27.390
Make sure to gather sheets...
and clothes.

01:28:32.020 --> 01:28:33.420
Yeah.

01:29:38.086 --> 01:29:39.486
Careful now.

01:29:40.922 --> 01:29:43.508
Connect this with the focus-works.
- Sure.

01:29:44.384 --> 01:29:46.011
Go play with your toys.

01:29:54.728 --> 01:29:57.522
No, no, no!
You cannot play with that!

01:29:57.814 --> 01:29:59.566
It's very dangerous.

01:30:01.234 --> 01:30:03.153
I know, I'm sorry.

01:30:03.653 --> 01:30:05.530
Don't be angry.

01:30:08.700 --> 01:30:12.078
I think you're very tired.
- Mommy!

01:30:13.204 --> 01:30:15.999
We're going home.
It's looking great!

01:30:20.170 --> 01:30:22.213
Want to do it yourself?
There!

01:31:02.337 --> 01:31:03.893
I'm on the verge of making it work.

01:31:04.214 --> 01:31:06.883
That's great. Congratulations.

01:31:18.728 --> 01:31:20.128
What's wrong?

01:31:21.564 --> 01:31:22.964
You're so talented.

01:31:23.483 --> 01:31:25.110
At brushing my teeth?

01:31:26.695 --> 01:31:30.240
The corners of your mouth...
I love how they point upward.

01:31:31.700 --> 01:31:33.118
It's like you can't be sad.

01:31:40.583 --> 01:31:43.586
I admire you. How you persevere.

01:31:44.629 --> 01:31:50.593
Wait till you see the result.
I want you both to be proud of me.

01:32:10.655 --> 01:32:12.824
Should I go with another image?

01:32:13.867 --> 01:32:16.244
No, this one's great. Really.

01:32:17.162 --> 01:32:18.872
Really?
- Yes.

01:32:22.208 --> 01:32:24.210
God, I don't know
why I'm so nervous.

01:32:24.961 --> 01:32:28.548
I want it to be a paradise...

01:32:31.217 --> 01:32:32.635
Let's do it. Turn it on.

01:32:43.938 --> 01:32:45.338
Yes!

01:33:20.767 --> 01:33:23.311
Have you seen the image?
What do you think?

01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:24.938
It's nice.
- Isn't it?

01:33:25.397 --> 01:33:26.797
I can change images too.

01:33:41.246 --> 01:33:42.646
Isagel!

01:33:47.085 --> 01:33:48.485
Isagel!

01:33:52.924 --> 01:33:54.324
No...

01:33:54.926 --> 01:33:56.678
No. No!

01:33:56.761 --> 01:33:59.097
You asshole! You asshole!

01:35:03.370 --> 01:35:04.770
Get up!

NASA and Aniara.

01:36:51.728 --> 01:36:53.938
We are pioneers
who have gone further into space

01:36:54.064 --> 01:36:55.940
than anyone before us.

01:36:56.649 --> 01:36:58.234
That's worth a round of applause.

01:37:07.827 --> 01:37:10.121
I would now like
to hand out an honorary medal.

01:37:11.039 --> 01:37:13.375
May I ask you, MR,
to come up on stage?

01:37:41.945 --> 01:37:44.197
MR is awarded
the Aniara Honorary Medal

01:37:44.656 --> 01:37:45.949
for her beam-screen,

01:37:46.074 --> 01:37:48.868
which has helped us
remember our origins

01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:51.663
and transported us
to glittering waterfalls,

01:37:51.913 --> 01:37:55.500
wonderful pine forests,
and glorious summer meadows.

01:39:01.399 --> 01:39:05.070

On Earth I saw the light...

01:39:59.749 --> 01:40:01.149
with my skin.

01:40:03.795 --> 01:40:06.381
The vision seared me...

01:40:10.635 --> 01:40:12.035
my skin.

01:40:14.639 --> 01:40:18.018
I was blinded by a god.

01:40:19.519 --> 01:40:21.146
Give us light.

01:40:23.106 --> 01:40:27.068
Give us light.
Give us light.
