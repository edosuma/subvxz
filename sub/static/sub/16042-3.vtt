00:07.330 --> 00:09.400
- I want my money, Isabelle.
- Your money's safe.

00:09.500 --> 00:10.899
Nick's invested in a startup.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.150
-Agent Rask?
Special Agent Madeline Pierce.

00:13.160 --> 00:15.617
-Pleasure.
Today's all about
Andrew Talman.

00:15.660 --> 00:17.651
So,
who gave you that money?
My dad!

00:17.660 --> 00:19.287
He launders money
through his bank.

00:19.330 --> 00:22.151
I swore I would
never be that person.

00:22.200 --> 00:24.156
-I was this close
to losmg you today.

00:24.160 --> 00:26.993
--You kill one of us,
we gonna kill 10 of y'all!

00:27.000 --> 00:28.820
We're gonna get
the rest tomorrow.

00:28.830 --> 00:30.821
-No, you're not.
I wanna be your partner.

00:30.830 --> 00:33.287
-We still need eight million
to get GenCoin on its feet.

00:33.330 --> 00:34.900
- I know a lot of people.
- And so does he.

00:34.950 --> 00:36.030
Why not give him a shot?

01:01.040 --> 01:02.826
Jesus Christ.

01:05.120 --> 01:06.826
Pass to...
three on one.

01:06.910 --> 01:08.787
Takes it down
to the net, shoots.

01:11.910 --> 01:12.990
Welcome, my friend.

01:14.540 --> 01:16.246
Please, would you like a drink?
Give me the glass.

01:27.540 --> 01:30.327
-You like this girl?
This is a good girl, huh?

01:30.370 --> 01:31.689
Karina.
-Where's Daewon?

01:34.000 --> 01:35.399
-Daewon?
I don't know who this is.

01:36.700 --> 01:39.328
-Vadik, you do.
You know how I know?

01:39.330 --> 01:42.322
-Tell me.
-'Cause after
the last time I was here,

01:42.330 --> 01:44.821
I went back to my desk,
I watched, and I waited

01:44.870 --> 01:47.748
until four million US suddenly
vanished from Deutsche Bank

01:47.790 --> 01:50.441
and magically reappeared
in six different shell companies

01:50.500 --> 01:52.400
from Malaysia
to the Virgin Islands.

01:52.450 --> 01:54.862
- Oh yes.

01:56.160 --> 01:57.696
I retraced
each one of them--

01:57.750 --> 01:59.399
where it moved, how it moved.

01:59.450 --> 02:01.327
And there's _
only one person In my mInd

02:01.370 --> 02:04.191
who could manage all of that
so quickly, so cleanly.

02:04.250 --> 02:07.071
- Daewon?

02:07.120 --> 02:09.611
He's not here. Look around.

02:09.660 --> 02:11.992
My guy traced the IP address
back here...

02:12.040 --> 02:13.359
this morning.

02:16.580 --> 02:18.741
You, my friend,
look like someone
who works very hard, huh?

02:18.830 --> 02:21.116
Maybe you should have
a little fun.

02:21.160 --> 02:23.993
- Please, take Karina.
Don't do that.
Don't do that.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.194
I said don't do that!

02:26.540 --> 02:27.859
Don't do that.

02:30.450 --> 02:32.327
- Sure, okay.

02:35.830 --> 02:38.697
- What? What?

02:40.660 --> 02:43.538
-Feds. We have to go now.
-Two minute, almost done.

02:43.580 --> 02:46.151
-Show me.
-Show you what?

02:46.200 --> 02:48.657
-That he's not here. Show me.

02:50.660 --> 02:52.400
-Do you have a warrant?

02:55.410 --> 02:56.570
-Be smart.

03:00.500 --> 03:03.867
- Let's go!

03:03.950 --> 03:07.329
Every time
you come here, you bust
my balls for information,

03:07.330 --> 03:08.820
and I give it to you,
don't I? Don't I?

03:08.830 --> 03:10.991
Come on, hurry. Let's go!

03:11.080 --> 03:13.241
Put it away. Come on.

03:13.290 --> 03:14.325
Let's go.

04:06.450 --> 04:08.247
Get-- get down!

04:08.290 --> 04:10.155
- Arms!

04:16.040 --> 04:20.579
- Jesus. Yeah. Ooh.

05:28.450 --> 05:33.535
-Unfortunately, I-I-I--
I have to resign here.

05:35.450 --> 05:36.747
-Oh, wow.
-Yeah.

05:36.790 --> 05:37.825
-Okay.

05:38.910 --> 05:41.401
Okay.

05:41.500 --> 05:43.036
-Wasn't expecting that.

05:46.660 --> 05:49.493
-You know, half this world
ain't got access to banking.

05:49.540 --> 05:53.442
You go to some messed up village
in Sudan where a nigga ain't got
two coins to rub together,

05:53.500 --> 05:55.320
guarantee you,
he still got a cell phone.

05:55.370 --> 05:58.157
-Thanks for making it.
When'd you get in?
-Saturday.

05:58.250 --> 06:01.902
It's-- it's lunches,
dinners, and just--
-Lunches, dinners.

06:01.950 --> 06:04.407
Look, I know
the powder been good to y'all,

06:04.450 --> 06:07.112
but it's 2016.
The feds are locking
that shit down.

06:07.160 --> 06:08.320
It's time to start
looking ahead.

06:08.370 --> 06:11.908
-I got like $200,000
in student loans,

06:11.950 --> 06:13.577
I have interest
climbing every day,

06:13.620 --> 06:16.908
and I can't even
justify why I got 'em
in the first place.

06:16.950 --> 06:20.113
So, the difference
between BitCoin and this
and other cryptocurrencies

06:20.160 --> 06:21.536
is that we have the best one.

06:21.580 --> 06:24.367
And I know that we have
a better than the best one,

06:24.410 --> 06:26.492
we have "the" one, and...

06:26.540 --> 06:29.691
quality and class
tells over time.

06:29.750 --> 06:32.822
- Digital currency.
- Free from government.

06:32.830 --> 06:35.321
All you need is this here.

06:35.370 --> 06:39.249
We've actually already raised
2.2 million very fast,

06:39.290 --> 06:41.497
and we're looking
for an additional eight
to launch.

06:41.500 --> 06:42.944
-So, what type of team
do you have?

06:43.000 --> 06:44.285
-We're just starting
to assemble that,

06:44.330 --> 06:47.037
so the team is being built
as we speak.

06:47.080 --> 06:49.241
- Okay.
- What does Taylor have to say?

06:49.290 --> 06:51.781
Have you talked to her about it?

06:51.830 --> 06:53.786
-Things been quiet
between us for a minute,

06:53.830 --> 06:55.616
so this ain't no olive branch
or nothin' like that.

06:55.660 --> 06:57.787
Straight up business.
You feel me?

06:57.830 --> 07:02.574
-Um, we are gonna put
5.3 towards marketing and PR.

07:02.620 --> 07:04.656
The goal with these things
always has to be

07:04.700 --> 07:06.827
to generate
a massive awareness
before the launch.

07:06.870 --> 07:08.246
I just wanted to see
if you wanted

07:08.330 --> 07:09.866
to get in on the ground floor
of something big.

07:09.910 --> 07:12.492
A'ight, check this out.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:12.500 --> 07:15.367
-Your PR expertise
and, to put it bluntly,

07:15.450 --> 07:17.031
your PR capital
would go a long way,

07:17.120 --> 07:19.281
'cause that's what we want
to put a lot of the money Into.

07:19.330 --> 07:22.948
-Cryptocurrency.
What you think?

07:23.000 --> 07:24.820
-I'll have some of my guys
take a look at her code,

07:24.910 --> 07:26.320
and we'll just-- we'll--
we'll circle back

07:26.410 --> 07:27.786
in a couple of weeks, okay?

07:27.830 --> 07:29.900
-Well, here's what I would say.
Definitely do that,

07:29.950 --> 07:34.319
but the sooner the better,
only because we're moving
very, very fast

07:34.370 --> 07:37.191
-I'm sorry. I gotta go.
-All right. Feel better.

07:37.250 --> 07:39.650
-Come up here, think you gonna
take us for some sorta ride?

07:39.700 --> 07:41.076
-I'm just offering you
a little piece.

07:52.330 --> 07:55.151
-This the kinda game,
bring the Puerto Ricans up
like the Cubans?

07:56.660 --> 07:59.538
-This company is
truly the future of currency.

07:59.620 --> 08:01.781
-It's a pleasure.

08:14.410 --> 08:16.901
I got
plenty more trees to shake.
Y'all don't fret.

08:16.950 --> 08:19.532
-No, it's fine.
We'll just launch in 2056.

08:19.580 --> 08:22.572
-Bitch, it's only been
a few days.

08:22.620 --> 08:25.282
-Tru|y, "the currency
of the future."

08:25.330 --> 08:27.321
- Yeah, what about you?
- A family of dry foots?

08:27.370 --> 08:29.998
-Family doesn't have money.
I thought I told you
that already.

08:30.040 --> 08:31.996
-Yeah, but they know
some folks that do.
Ain't that right?

08:33.160 --> 08:35.367
-I can't do that.

08:35.450 --> 08:37.111
-What about the first three
you gave Nick's dad?

08:37.160 --> 08:39.321
You can't get more?
-More?

08:39.330 --> 08:41.286
That first three,
that was everything.

08:41.330 --> 08:42.786
Our entire hood,
that was our stash.

08:42.830 --> 08:44.821
Ain't come from one of us.
Came from all of us.

08:50.080 --> 08:51.650
But you gimme
some time, I can...

08:51.660 --> 08:53.321
I can make shit work.

08:55.040 --> 08:57.440
The DR's and us, we working
on an alliance.
-What's that?

08:57.500 --> 08:59.570
-The gang?
-What's the D--?

08:59.620 --> 09:01.827
the D-- No.

09:01.870 --> 09:06.079
No. No more gang money.
This is supposed to be
a legitimate business.

09:06.120 --> 09:07.747
-Oh yeah, South Beach,
'cause your--

09:07.790 --> 09:10.998
your seed money looking
real legit right now.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.695
-That is different.
-How is it different?

09:12.750 --> 09:15.150
-It's-- just trust me,
it's different.

09:15.200 --> 09:16.656
-Boy, you are tripping.

09:16.660 --> 09:18.150
-Rona|d, we made you a partner

09:18.160 --> 09:19.491
because you'd secure
more investors!

09:19.540 --> 09:21.997
-Made him a partner 'cause he
hit me in the head with a gun.
-Man up! Nick!

09:22.040 --> 09:24.156
-Yeah, I'll do it again,
you don't watch your
goddamn mouth, son.

09:24.200 --> 09:25.997
-All right, you see?
I don't need that.
-Shit!

09:26.000 --> 09:28.491
- I don't--
You just gonna
walk away like that, white boy?

09:28.580 --> 09:32.493
-Yes! I don't need
some, some...
-Some what?

09:32.580 --> 09:34.741
Go on. Spit, South Beach.

09:34.790 --> 09:36.360
Just say "nigga,"
be done with it.

09:36.410 --> 09:37.900
- God, I was not gonna say that!
- No! No!

09:37.950 --> 09:39.861
-Listen! Do me _a favor.
-That's not what this-- shut up!

09:39.910 --> 09:42.868
-Let me know when there's
no one making threats to me
or my entire family.

09:42.910 --> 09:45.242
We can talk about business.
-Let me know when you grow
a sack of nuts.

09:45.290 --> 09:47.781
-Rea|ly?
-Listen, I believed
in GenCoin, Izzy.

09:47.830 --> 09:49.991
I still do, but not like this.
-Nick.

09:50.040 --> 09:51.655
-Not if it's gonna be
like this, no.
-Nick.

09:57.370 --> 09:59.656
Do we even need that cracker?

09:59.700 --> 10:01.440
You're an asshole.

10:20.250 --> 10:23.492
Right, well,
they didn't confirm yet
officially, though, did they?

10:23.540 --> 10:26.828
Y-y-- honestly,
I think we can just scrap
the chairs altogether.

10:26.870 --> 10:30.579
People are gonna be out there
for like five, 10 minutes tops.

10:30.620 --> 10:33.828
Yeah. No, let's-let's, uh,
let's just scrap it.

10:35.330 --> 10:38.037
-Umm... okay, have a good one.

10:38.080 --> 10:39.650
Bye.

10:39.660 --> 10:41.651
Hey, sorry about that.

10:41.660 --> 10:44.367
This thing on Saturday's gotten
way bigger than I expected.

10:44.450 --> 10:45.860
-No, it's good.
Your dad's thing?

10:45.950 --> 10:47.998
-Yeah, his fundraiser.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.743
I was thinking about putting you
in a foursome with him.

10:54.330 --> 10:57.151
-I just don't want him
to try and hook me up
with a job or anything.

10:57.200 --> 10:59.862
-I know, I know,
but look, that's my dad, okay?

10:59.910 --> 11:02.822
-It's literally the only way
he knows how to show people
he cares about 'em.

11:02.870 --> 11:04.906
He likes you.
-No, he doesn't.

11:04.950 --> 11:06.247
-Yes, he does.
-No, he doesn't.

11:06.290 --> 11:08.246
-Trust me,
compared to other Nick,

11:08.290 --> 11:10.326
all those tattoos--
-Don't talk to me

11:10.370 --> 11:13.362
about other Nick.
-If you really don't want to go,

11:13.410 --> 11:15.492
you don't have to.

11:15.540 --> 11:17.531
I just thought you might want
to rub some elbows.

11:28.200 --> 11:30.156
- Okay.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.149
I'll go.

11:34.830 --> 11:37.572
-You sure?
-Yeah, absolutely.

11:37.620 --> 11:39.781
I just gotta find my clubs,
gotta learn how to be racist.

11:39.830 --> 11:41.900
-Oh, that's so sweet.

11:41.950 --> 11:43.497
Thank you
for doing that for me.

11:43.540 --> 11:44.575
-You're welcome.
-Yeah.

11:47.790 --> 11:51.157
I'm open for business again,
by the way.

11:51.200 --> 11:52.827
-So am I.
-Oh, really?

11:52.870 --> 11:53.996
-Mm-hmm.
-Mmm.

11:55.290 --> 11:56.325
Okay.

12:21.250 --> 12:22.615
-Who is that?

12:22.660 --> 12:24.616
-Are you expecting someone?

12:24.660 --> 12:26.321
-No. Are you?
-Are you sure?

12:26.370 --> 12:29.032
--No.

12:29.080 --> 12:30.820
-Just-- damn it.
-Ignore It.

12:30.870 --> 12:32.189
No, come on.
-Damn it.

12:32.250 --> 12:33.615
-No. Babe.
-No, one second.

12:33.660 --> 12:35.787
Let me just--
I think I know. Let me...
-Babe. Babe.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.492
-Don't. No.
-Just wait for me.

12:53.500 --> 12:55.149
- Nick.
- Not here.

12:55.160 --> 12:57.242
I'll meet you in the car.
I'll meet you in the car.

13:01.160 --> 13:03.697
You can't just come to my house.
Why would you come to my house?

13:03.750 --> 13:05.820
-The phone would've been worse.

13:05.870 --> 13:08.031
-N-no one followed me,
I made sure of it.

13:08.080 --> 13:11.823
-Whose money did you give me?
Who else's money was that?
You said it was your money.

13:11.870 --> 13:14.077
I had no idea
what I was walking into!
-Did someone talk to you?

13:14.120 --> 13:16.361
-Yeah, someone talked to me!
Ronald talked to me!

13:16.410 --> 13:18.492
We had a very nice talk!
-Oh Christ, the Haitian?

13:18.540 --> 13:22.032
He came after you?
-He dragged me out
to the fucking Everglades.

13:22.080 --> 13:23.490
Look at my head.
-Oh!

13:23.540 --> 13:25.826
-He was about to kill me!
-It's cracked. Don't...

13:25.870 --> 13:28.998
-Then the FBI came to my office.
Guess how much that sucked.

13:29.040 --> 13:31.861
-Was it an Agent Rask?
-Yeah, a friend of yours?

13:31.950 --> 13:34.498
-What'd you tell him?
-I didn't tell him anything,

13:34.540 --> 13:36.440
but he could see it
all over my face.

13:36.500 --> 13:38.786
-Yeah, it's okay. You did good.
-I'm not well-versed
in this like you!

13:38.830 --> 13:41.446
-Look, he-- he won't do
anything to you, okay?

13:41.500 --> 13:43.946
He can't.
-He's FBI!

13:44.000 --> 13:46.821
-It's... complicated with Rask.

13:46.870 --> 13:49.111
Just put it this way, he...

13:50.200 --> 13:52.407
He's not what you think he is.

14:00.120 --> 14:02.827
-You doing okay?
-I wasn't looking at her.

14:02.830 --> 14:04.991
-You need anything?

14:05.000 --> 14:06.695
-I need you
to stop ignoring me.

14:06.750 --> 14:08.149
- Sure.

14:16.330 --> 14:18.651
-Hey.
-Sorry it took me so long.

14:18.660 --> 14:20.446
There's still traffic here
at 10:00?

14:20.500 --> 14:22.070
-So, what do you drink?

14:22.120 --> 14:25.078
-Umm, no, I'm okay.
-What, you don't drink?

14:25.120 --> 14:27.748
- Not when I'm working.

14:27.790 --> 14:30.532
-Nat? Two Zippers. Thanks.

14:32.040 --> 14:33.610
_ Here we mix
busmess With pleasure,

14:33.660 --> 14:35.571
otherwise there's
no time for pleasure.

14:37.370 --> 14:40.157
-How'd he get on?
-Actually, better
than I thought.

14:40.200 --> 14:43.909
-Mm-hmm.
-I tailed Nick, 'cause I was
thinking you're probably right.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.651
If all the accounts
I grabbed from BFO went cold,

14:46.660 --> 14:48.651
then the only way
Andrew could've moved the money

14:48.660 --> 14:50.241
was through another banker.
-Yeah, I told you.

14:50.330 --> 14:51.786
He's pissing himself.
-Right.

14:51.830 --> 14:53.866
And also...
-What's that?

14:56.330 --> 14:58.491
Diverse group
of friends he's got.

14:58.500 --> 15:00.991
W-what is this?
- A UN meeting on the beach?

15:01.080 --> 15:03.787
--Thanks, Nat.

15:03.830 --> 15:05.400
-Oh, Jesus.
-Mmm.

15:05.450 --> 15:07.998
-What is this?
-This? It's a Zipper.

15:08.040 --> 15:11.862
- Enjoy.
- It looks like a shot
of tequila and a beer.

15:11.910 --> 15:13.366
-It kinda does, huh?

15:17.580 --> 15:18.695
--Salud.

15:24.250 --> 15:26.150
You all right there?

15:26.160 --> 15:27.240
- Yeah.

15:28.700 --> 15:32.329
The girl is Izzy Morales
from Hialeah, no priors.

15:32.370 --> 15:35.828
That's all I've got so far.
-Find out who the black guy is.

15:35.870 --> 15:37.155
Oh, uh, Nat?

15:37.200 --> 15:39.657
Two more, please.
-Wait. No. Wait.

15:39.660 --> 15:41.787
-No, you wait. Thanks, Nat.

15:43.160 --> 15:45.321
- You're trouble.

15:47.330 --> 15:50.288
-That's what they say.

15:50.330 --> 15:53.242
-Why don't you just--
why don't you just give him
what he wants?

15:53.290 --> 15:55.997
-'Cause it's not my money!
-I know that.

15:56.040 --> 15:59.612
-I'm screwed either way!
I can run or go to jail!

15:59.660 --> 16:01.696
-Maybe you should've
gone to jail then!

16:01.750 --> 16:05.151
-Nick, you are holding
onto a time bomb.

16:05.200 --> 16:07.657
You've got to move it
into that account I gave you

16:07.660 --> 16:09.321
before somebody else--
-I invested it.

16:11.660 --> 16:13.571
-You invested it?
-Yeah, in a startup,

16:13.660 --> 16:15.787
small tech
company called GenCoin.
I thought maybe I could--

16:15.830 --> 16:18.321
-All 2.2 million?
-I thought I could do something
good with that money!

16:18.370 --> 16:20.998
-You've gotta get it back, Nick.
That money isn't yours.

16:22.830 --> 16:25.116
It wasn't mine either!
-Yeah, I know.

16:25.160 --> 16:27.321
-You were supposed to move it.
You were supposed to put it--

16:27.410 --> 16:29.947
-Well, I didn't,
did I? I didn't!
-Shit.

16:32.370 --> 16:33.655
-You still don't get it.

16:34.870 --> 16:38.112
You like to_ think
you're so... righteous

16:38.160 --> 16:40.151
all these years,
never taking my money,

16:40.200 --> 16:42.942
but it wasn't
because it was dirty.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.240
-No?
-No.

16:44.290 --> 16:45.939
It's out of spite.

16:47.370 --> 16:50.533
So... where's that
gotten you, huh?

16:50.580 --> 16:51.695
How's that working out?

16:54.660 --> 16:57.823
-Money'll all be there tomorrow,
all but the Haitian's cut.

16:57.870 --> 17:00.031
It's just gonna be the last
you'll ever hear from me.

17:57.410 --> 17:58.399
-Hey.

17:59.410 --> 18:00.399
Here.

18:00.450 --> 18:03.749
-Mmm. You're a saint.
-Mm-hmm.

18:08.830 --> 18:11.071
I smell bacon.
-That's 'cause there is bacon.

18:13.500 --> 18:15.991
-Mmm.
-There's plenty
if you're hungry.

18:18.160 --> 18:21.493
-I work the day shift today.
-I'll box it up for you.

18:21.500 --> 18:25.152
-I'm not hungry, really.
Thank you.

18:25.160 --> 18:26.491
It's sweet.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.532
- Isabelle?

18:46.910 --> 18:49.401
I need help
with my computer, mija.

18:52.750 --> 18:56.151
Look, don't get
all grumpy with me.
It's almost noon.

18:56.160 --> 18:58.993
- I worked all night.
- Yeah, it must've
been hard work,

18:59.040 --> 19:00.940
drinking all
of your father's Heineken.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.194
-Hey, Izzy.
-Hey.

19:02.290 --> 19:04.190
- Hey.

19:04.290 --> 19:05.860
You trying
to play "Oregon Trail"?

19:05.950 --> 19:08.828
What?
Ma, this computer's
as old as me.

19:08.830 --> 19:12.652
-Okay, look,
I've been trying to email
this video to Heidi, okay?

19:12.750 --> 19:16.151
I never have a problem with it.
-Well, right, obviously. Move.

19:25.660 --> 19:27.696
What are you doing?
I'm not doing
nothing yet.

19:27.750 --> 19:29.615
This shit's having
a damn aneurysm.

19:32.540 --> 19:33.575
I got it!

19:35.830 --> 19:37.900
- Hey, Izz.
- What, Del?

19:38.000 --> 19:39.490
Someone's here for you.

19:43.450 --> 19:46.157
-How much?
-All of it,

19:46.160 --> 19:48.537
except for Ronald's 300.

19:48.620 --> 19:50.656
Look, it was...

19:52.580 --> 19:55.117
Do you wanna get
some food or something?
-Food? It was what?

19:55.160 --> 19:58.903
-Okay, okay, okay, obviously,
I wasn't 100% transparent
with you...

19:58.950 --> 20:00.941
-C|early!
-...in the beginning.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.197
And there was one other thing
that I neglected to mention,

20:04.250 --> 20:05.615
which is...

20:06.910 --> 20:08.537
And I should've.
I definitely should've,

20:08.580 --> 20:11.868
but this FBI guy came
to my office a week ago

20:11.910 --> 20:14.037
looking for my dad
and apparently the money,

20:14.080 --> 20:16.401
so we should
just definitely give it back.
-Don't you think that you

20:16.500 --> 20:18.365
should've been straight up
with me about shit like this?

20:18.410 --> 20:19.695
-Yes, of course I should've.

20:19.750 --> 20:21.490
Of course, and I'm--
I'm very sorry I didn't.

20:21.500 --> 20:23.570
-I'm not going to prison, Nick.
-No, of course not.

20:23.660 --> 20:25.821
Look, you didn't even know.
This can go away.

20:25.830 --> 20:28.867
We just have to give it back.
Okay? That's all we have to do.

20:28.950 --> 20:31.657
We give the money to my dad,
FBI guy finds my dad,

20:31.660 --> 20:34.447
he goes to jail,
we get left alone.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.651
-That's cold.
-Well, it's a long story.

20:42.370 --> 20:44.076
-So, I'd be back at zero.

20:44.120 --> 20:47.362
-No. No, no, no, 'cause we
would still have the 300--
-Who is we?

20:47.410 --> 20:49.571
-Well, I would still very much
like to be involved.

20:49.620 --> 20:51.531
-Invo|ved in what?
-In the company!

20:51.580 --> 20:53.070
-In m
y com
-Yes! pany?

20:53.120 --> 20:56.192
-You are a guy in a suit
who gave me cash!
-Oh. Oh. Okay.

20:56.250 --> 20:59.071
Okay. Put the money back,
I'll be on my way, all right?

20:59.160 --> 21:01.321
And good luck finding
another fundraiser.
-A fundraiser?

21:01.370 --> 21:02.746
-Yes.
-You didn't bring shit
to the table!

21:02.830 --> 21:04.650
-Actually, no,
I have a lot of good leads.

21:04.660 --> 21:07.322
-Actually, you have dick!
-Fine. You know what?
That's fucking fine.

21:07.370 --> 21:08.997
--Keep...

21:12.950 --> 21:16.909
You want to go to prison?
Do you want to be around
to see GenCoin through?

21:16.950 --> 21:18.941
Then you have to give
the money back, all right?

21:22.870 --> 21:24.861
So, is that a yes?
Are you gonna give it--

21:24.910 --> 21:27.492
are you gonna put it back
in the account? Okay, I would
like to clean that up--

21:27.540 --> 21:28.575
-Get out!
-All right.

21:48.290 --> 21:51.032
-Hi.
-Oh. You could've waited.

21:51.120 --> 21:52.860
I was gonna come--
-No, I-- I just didn't want you

21:55.540 --> 21:57.747
-Come on in.
-Yeah, thanks.

21:57.790 --> 21:59.826
It-- it's just a little...

21:59.830 --> 22:02.321
welcome gift.
I've been meaning
to do something, you know?

22:03.330 --> 22:05.491
_-Rum?
-Not just any rum.

22:05.540 --> 22:07.826
That there is
Haitian five-star sipping rum.

22:07.870 --> 22:09.861
It's aged eight years.
This is really nice.

22:11.290 --> 22:13.440
-It looks fancy.
-Oh, it's so not fancy.

22:13.500 --> 22:14.785
Tastes good, though.

22:14.830 --> 22:16.786
Now you can mix business
with pleasure.

22:18.040 --> 22:20.827
-Right. Thank you.

22:24.330 --> 22:26.992
-What?
-Nothing.

22:29.080 --> 22:32.322
-Okay, come on.
Get your shit, let's go.
-Right.

22:38.330 --> 22:40.491
-Just give me one sec.
-All right.

24:53.250 --> 24:54.399
-Same tomorrow?

24:55.870 --> 24:57.360
-Not gonna be here tomorrow.

24:59.450 --> 25:04.114
-Thank you, Carmen,
for... keeping me company.

25:05.580 --> 25:06.945
Meant the world.

25:13.910 --> 25:14.990
Get out.

26:37.080 --> 26:38.490
-Whoo!

26:40.200 --> 26:42.998
You the man.
I ain't got that much left
in the tank.

26:43.040 --> 26:45.691
- Defense! Defense!
Let's go.

26:45.790 --> 26:48.111
Enjoy. Thank you.
Thank you.

26:48.160 --> 26:50.788
What's up, family?
Thanks for coming out.

26:50.830 --> 26:52.821
-There you go. Hey.
-Thanks. Thank you very much.

26:52.910 --> 26:55.071
-Oh, how touching.
Thank you. Enjoy it.

26:55.120 --> 26:59.113
- What's up, Lance?
- Big Ronnie!

26:59.160 --> 27:00.866
What's going on, baby?

27:00.910 --> 27:04.038
-Oh, bruh.
Hey, man, good to see you.
-It's good to see you.

27:04.080 --> 27:06.321
It's been, what,
10, 15 years at least, right?

27:06.370 --> 27:08.782
-You still looking good, bruh.
-No, man, 10, 15 years

27:08.830 --> 27:11.822
on the knees and ankles
ain't that good.

27:11.870 --> 27:14.156
Damn, it's good
to see you, bruh.
-Good to see you too, dawg.

27:14.200 --> 27:15.997
Hey, can I holla at you
for a minute, dawg?

27:16.040 --> 27:18.156
-Come on, man.
Come on. All day.

27:18.200 --> 27:21.192
How's Tam doing?
-She a'ight, she good. She good.

27:21.290 --> 27:24.032
Got two now, you know?
-No shit?

27:24.120 --> 27:26.497
I remember meeting
your boy a long time ago.
-Yeah, Toussant.

27:26.500 --> 27:28.036
-That's right.
You brought him
to a game, right?

27:28.120 --> 27:29.826
-Yeah, you was in town
against the Heat.

27:29.830 --> 27:33.573
He got to go down to the floor,
he was five years old,

27:33.620 --> 27:35.827
blew his goddamn mind.

27:46.160 --> 27:47.570
-So, what you got for me, Ron?

27:47.620 --> 27:49.497
You said you're trying
to help the neighborhood out?

27:49.540 --> 27:51.826
What you got for me? Come on.
-All right, check this out.

27:51.870 --> 27:54.828
You in the real estate game.
That's a solid game.

27:54.830 --> 27:56.741
Everybody know it.
Safest game there is.

27:58.330 --> 28:00.036
But it ain't
what the future about.

28:01.250 --> 28:02.569
Cryptocurrency.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.651
That's the next game.

28:06.660 --> 28:09.151
-What you talking about?
-I'm talking about
a new currency.

28:10.370 --> 28:13.908
Unregulated,
untaxed, incorruptible.

28:13.950 --> 28:16.612
Not part of no government
or economy,

28:16.660 --> 28:18.116
'cause it's its own economy.

28:18.160 --> 28:20.788
Give every man, woman,
and child in Little Haiti,

28:20.830 --> 28:23.993
across the world,
a level playing field.
Check this out.

28:26.950 --> 28:29.942
Pretend like you one of us
coming up the way
we done come up.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.820
You a boy fixing to become
a man, right quick,

28:31.870 --> 28:34.441
trying to go into business
for yourself instead
of slinging rocks.

28:34.500 --> 28:36.741
How you supposed
to lock down one of them loans?

28:36.830 --> 28:38.900
Bank ain't gonna touch you.
You ain't got no credit score.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.651
Breaking your back to get even.

28:41.660 --> 28:45.778
GenCoin. You can apply
for that money right here.

28:45.830 --> 28:48.617
A loan that
ain't got nothing to do
with profit on the other end,

28:48.660 --> 28:51.823
because you not borrowing
from a corporation, you not
borrowing from no bank.

28:51.870 --> 28:54.498
You borrowing
from the currency itself.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.649
A currency owned by the people.

29:03.620 --> 29:05.576
You smoking
that pipe again, man?

29:06.910 --> 29:09.367
-You know
I ain't for that, dawg.

29:09.410 --> 29:12.152
Shit is serious, dawg.
-Yeah, yeah, you know
what it takes

29:12.200 --> 29:15.112
to put something
like this out there?
-We already got the seed money,

29:15.160 --> 29:19.153
but first I figured I'd give
some folks the opportunity
to get in early.

29:19.160 --> 29:21.196
I figured, shit,
it might be somebody
from the hood.

29:26.200 --> 29:29.158
-You come here
to ask me for money?
That's what's up?

29:32.620 --> 29:35.612
-I came here to offer you
an opportunity, dawg.

29:37.830 --> 29:39.320
-I'm gonna tell you
what I'm gonna do.

29:48.500 --> 29:53.369
You take that home
to Tam and the kids...

29:53.410 --> 29:56.243
and you do whatever
you need to do to get
your life back on track.

29:56.290 --> 29:58.497
Go buy yourself a nice suit,

29:58.540 --> 30:01.498
apply for a real job.
-I ain't for no charity, dawg.

30:01.540 --> 30:04.498
-What, you think I'm a sucker?
You know how many
broke-ass niggas

30:04.540 --> 30:07.247
come knocking on my damn door
every day with their hands out?

30:07.330 --> 30:10.822
Trying to sell me
a bullshit line about _
some busmess opportunity?

30:12.500 --> 30:13.865
You better than that, Ronald.

30:15.160 --> 30:16.650
Shit, at least I thought so.

30:26.700 --> 30:27.997
-See you later.

30:28.040 --> 30:30.440
-Awesome.
Thank you, Brett.

30:32.620 --> 30:34.326
-Hey.
-Hey.

30:34.370 --> 30:37.442
Thank you.
Got an ID on the Haitian.

30:37.500 --> 30:40.742
Ronald Dacey,
major player with the LH7.

30:40.790 --> 30:44.999
-Hmm. Okay, Andrew Talman--
been doing this half his life.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.571
But his son has no priors,
no previous experience

30:47.660 --> 30:49.867
in this kind of thing
as far as we know.

30:49.950 --> 30:52.032
-Maybe he was just nervous.

30:52.120 --> 30:54.827
Most people get nervous
like that, even if they
haven't done anything.

30:54.870 --> 30:57.156
-Nah. I know nervous,
and I know liars.

30:57.200 --> 30:59.077
He's hiding
something for sure.

30:59.120 --> 31:01.247
-Maybe that's all he's doing.

31:01.290 --> 31:03.747
He could know something,
and he's protecting his dad,

31:03.790 --> 31:05.496
but it doesn't mean
he's helping him with money.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.444
-Come on,
let me show you something.

31:22.080 --> 31:23.820
-Nestor!
-What's up, my man?

31:23.830 --> 31:25.320
-What up, man? Good to go?
-Let's do this.

31:25.370 --> 31:26.860
-All right.

31:30.370 --> 31:34.158
-Hey, how's the wife?
-Ah, she's great. She left me.

31:34.200 --> 31:35.531
- Oh.

31:36.700 --> 31:38.327
-Thanks, Nestor.
Won't be a minute.

31:38.370 --> 31:39.610
-Long as you need.

31:39.660 --> 31:41.571
--What are we doing?

31:42.950 --> 31:45.498
-How long you been in Miami now?
Is it... two weeks?

31:45.580 --> 31:47.821
-Three.
-Three? Right.

31:47.830 --> 31:51.288
Well, the first thing
you gotta understand
is that Miami

31:51.330 --> 31:53.742
is a haven for dirty money.

31:54.950 --> 31:56.531
Florida's homestead exemption

31:56.580 --> 31:58.400
_ means that_
white-collar criminals

31:58.450 --> 32:00.441
can dump all of their money
into real estate

32:00.500 --> 32:02.741
and the government's
not allowed to touch any.

32:02.790 --> 32:04.075
-Even if they're convicted.
-Even--

32:04.120 --> 32:06.076
-I know.
-Good.

32:07.160 --> 32:10.698
Good. Now, pay attention.

32:10.750 --> 32:12.991
Here we got
Miami Beach, obviously.

32:13.040 --> 32:15.156
But all these houses
that we can see from here,

32:15.200 --> 32:18.033
I would say about 18% of them,
bought with dirty money.

32:18.120 --> 32:20.497
A lot of that money flows
from over there.

32:20.500 --> 32:24.493
Brickell, Miami's shiny new
financial district.

32:24.500 --> 32:27.116
You thought Wall Street
was sleazy? Jesus.

32:27.160 --> 32:29.572
Try pulling
a few recent files on Brickell.

32:29.620 --> 32:33.863
Now, as well as being a mecca
for unclean wealth,

32:33.910 --> 32:37.368
Miami is also bringing in
more guns, drugs, and hot cars

32:37.410 --> 32:39.867
than any other city
on the East Coast,

32:39.910 --> 32:43.073
mainly through
Port Miami just there.

32:43.120 --> 32:45.998
These days
it's largely controlled
by the Cubans.

32:46.040 --> 32:47.826
Speaking of--
let me show you.

32:47.830 --> 32:51.573
Miami is_also_ home
to more Immigrants
than anywhere else in the US.

32:51.660 --> 32:54.823
Next year,
half the babies
born in this city

32:54.830 --> 32:56.445
_ will be born
to Immigrant parents--

32:56.500 --> 33:00.197
Dominicans, Haitians,
Nigerians, Russians, Chinese--

33:00.290 --> 33:02.827
the list goes on.
But of all those populations,

33:02.870 --> 33:07.569
the one group that has climbed
the socioeconomic ladder
startlingly well

33:07.620 --> 33:10.999
is the Cubans.
Like those houses
out on Biscayne Bay?

33:11.000 --> 33:14.618
The big ones?
A lot of that is Cuban coin.

33:14.660 --> 33:17.367
But their roots?
You know, where they started?

33:18.450 --> 33:19.656
Over here. Look.

33:19.700 --> 33:22.328
See that?
With the park in the middle?

33:22.370 --> 33:24.406
-Yeah.
-That's Hialeah.

33:24.450 --> 33:28.329
Biggest population of Cubans
outside of Cuba itself.

33:28.330 --> 33:29.820
Everyone thinks
that's Little Havana,

33:29.870 --> 33:31.406
but that's just
the postcard version.

33:31.500 --> 33:34.492
You want the real Cuba,
you gotta cross the river.

33:34.540 --> 33:37.282
Now the Haitians--
oy, that's something different.

33:37.330 --> 33:38.991
Unlike when
the Cubans came here--

33:39.000 --> 33:41.150
they're granted asylum,
they're welcomed in--

33:41.160 --> 33:43.321
the Haitians come,
they're told to go back.

33:43.370 --> 33:46.112
So, anyone who does stay
is going to be persecuted,

33:46.160 --> 33:48.321
demeaned, relegated
to this patch of land

33:48.410 --> 33:52.619
just across the 195 there.
That's Little Haiti,

33:52.660 --> 33:55.037
some of the most desperate
people in all of Miami-Dade.

33:55.080 --> 34:00.029
Drugs, gangs,
turf wars, poverty--
all day, every day.

34:03.910 --> 34:05.320
So, you got your bearings?

34:06.910 --> 34:08.491
-Almost.
-All right.

34:08.540 --> 34:11.191
So, standing up here,
looking around at all this,

34:11.250 --> 34:13.195
you've got to think
about one thing:

34:13.250 --> 34:16.071
What does
a banker from Brickell,
a hacker from Hialeah,

34:16.160 --> 34:18.151
and a thug from Little Haiti
have in common?

34:19.870 --> 34:23.158
-I don't know.
-Me neither.

34:23.200 --> 34:26.192
But once we do,
that's where the money went.

34:39.040 --> 34:40.359
They're just a little bit late.

34:40.410 --> 34:41.616
Oh, oh, oh, reintroduce me.

34:41.660 --> 34:43.196
-Afternoon. How are you?

34:43.250 --> 34:44.319
-Hi.
-Lovely to see you.

34:44.370 --> 34:46.247
-Welcome. _
So glad you could make it.

34:46.290 --> 34:49.157
-Hi, how are you?
Taylor. Good to meet you.
Thank you so much for coming.

34:49.200 --> 34:51.612
-What a spectacular event
you've put on this year.

34:51.660 --> 34:53.321
-No, no, no, I had--
I had nothing to do with it.

34:53.330 --> 34:55.150
-My daughter is my--
-It's what I do.

34:55.200 --> 34:58.033
-She own_s her own
event planning company.
She's very successful.

34:58.080 --> 35:00.036
Don't be shy.
-Thank you, Dad.

35:00.120 --> 35:01.860
You can sign in
right over there.

35:01.950 --> 35:03.998
Get a couple of extra tickets
and a drink afterwards.

35:10.080 --> 35:11.820
...so we're not
bombarding people...

35:15.000 --> 35:17.070
-Uh, one second.
Hey.Hoo!
-Hi.

35:17.120 --> 35:18.405
-You made it.
-Did you get my text?

35:18.450 --> 35:19.940
Yeah.
-I did, yeah.
You wanna go in the back?

35:20.000 --> 35:22.321
-I'll show you
kind of around.
-Okay.

35:22.370 --> 35:23.826
- My dad's here.
- Nick.

35:23.870 --> 35:26.077
Hey, did you meet Benedict yet?

35:26.120 --> 35:27.997
No.
- Hey, Benny Blush.
How you doing?

35:28.040 --> 35:29.746
_-Nick Talman.
Nice to meet you.

35:29.790 --> 35:32.691
-Hey, is this the one that's
shacking up with your daughter?

35:32.750 --> 35:36.572
- Yeah, that's the one.

35:36.660 --> 35:39.037
-All right, kid.
Great to meet you.

35:39.080 --> 35:41.492
- You too.
- Ben here owns Bark & Beak.

35:41.500 --> 35:44.492
-Oh really?
The pet store chain?
-Yeah.

35:44.500 --> 35:47.992
-Yeah, the guy prints money.
Makes real estate look
like a fool's errand.

35:50.330 --> 35:52.901
-Ooh, nice one, Leonard!

35:57.500 --> 35:59.616
-Uh, maybe.
-Huh?

35:59.660 --> 36:01.036
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

36:01.080 --> 36:03.537
Uh-huh.
-I'm good, thank you.

36:03.580 --> 36:05.741
-Well, well.
-All right.

36:05.790 --> 36:08.782
-Uh, you know that if you don't
make it past the women's,

36:08.830 --> 36:10.900
you play the rest of the hole
with your dick out.

36:10.950 --> 36:12.998
--You know that, right?

36:13.040 --> 36:14.860
-Yeah. No, I-- I was aware.
-Just-- just relax.

36:14.910 --> 36:17.071
All right, good.
He's good, he's good.
Yeah, yeah.

36:18.830 --> 36:19.990
- All right!

36:20.000 --> 36:22.491
-It's all right!
-God.

36:22.500 --> 36:26.152
-You dodged a bullet.
You missed it by that much.

36:26.160 --> 36:29.323
--I'll still show you my dick
if you wanna see it.

36:29.370 --> 36:33.079
Leo tells me
that you work at a bank.
Yeah, I do. Valencia.

36:33.120 --> 36:35.327
- What do you do there?
- Small business loans.

36:35.330 --> 36:37.491
What, he didn't--
he didn't tell you all about it?

36:37.500 --> 36:39.400
- He did.
- Yeah.

36:39.450 --> 36:42.328
-Actually, yeah.
Oh man, that man is
a piece of work.

36:42.370 --> 36:45.328
You know,
I don't think I ever had
a conversation with him

36:45.370 --> 36:47.782
that we didn't come around
to the bottom line.

36:47.830 --> 36:51.789
_-Uh-huh_.
-Me, I just got involved
with something I care about,

36:51.830 --> 36:54.993
and I got lucky.
-Yeah, so you love dogs, huh?

36:55.040 --> 36:57.156
- No, I love money.
- Oh, I see.

36:58.910 --> 37:02.323
- Oh.

37:04.080 --> 37:06.446
-Hey, nice round.
Great playing with you, kid.

37:06.500 --> 37:10.197
-Yeah, likewise.
-Let me know if you ever want to
get out from behind that desk.

37:10.290 --> 37:12.497
-Okay. Yeah.
-Earn some real scratch,
you know?

37:12.540 --> 37:15.657
_ And I'm not
saying that 'cause of Leo.
-I know, I know.

37:16.910 --> 37:18.946
Actually, Ben,
let me ask you something.

37:20.660 --> 37:23.868
You ever do any investing
in small businesses or startups?

37:23.910 --> 37:26.151
That sort of thing?
-Well, it depends.

37:26.200 --> 37:28.657
Why? You got some clients
that need partners?

37:28.700 --> 37:31.612
-No, no, I'm talking about
something for myself, actually.

37:31.660 --> 37:34.868
I'm starting my own company.
It's a tech company.

37:34.910 --> 37:37.947
It's called GenCoin.
It's the future of currency.

39:17.790 --> 39:18.996
-Baby.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.321
We don't sit like that. What?

39:25.410 --> 39:27.696
- Better eat, better eat.

39:27.750 --> 39:29.365
-Yo, Big Man Ronnie.

39:29.410 --> 39:31.742
-What you do, man?
Hey, pull up a chair, man.

39:31.790 --> 39:35.328
Food getting cold. Come on.
-Hey, Touie. Go ahead and take
your sister to bed.

39:35.370 --> 39:38.862
-What? You gonna send
your kids to bed hungry?

39:38.910 --> 39:40.787
-They're my kids, Jey.
I'll do whatever
the hell I want.

39:40.830 --> 39:42.616
-Come on, little.
Let's leave 'em.

39:42.660 --> 39:45.402
-Hey, hey, hey, hey.
You straight, man?

39:46.700 --> 39:48.656
-I'm straight.

39:48.700 --> 39:51.828
-Bye, Uncle Jey.
-I'|| catch y'all later. Bye.

40:01.000 --> 40:04.572
Emmanuel told me you been
meeting up with the DR's,
the Ricans.

40:04.620 --> 40:08.442
Word is you went to Lib City.
What's up with that?

40:08.500 --> 40:10.900
-Working on this new deal.
It's all good.

40:12.700 --> 40:13.689
-Mmm.

40:14.750 --> 40:18.402
Like Mark Cuban, huh?
My nigga.

40:18.450 --> 40:21.078
Entrepreneurial-ass motherfucker
right here.

40:21.120 --> 40:23.782
You know about that, Tam?
-Yeah, course she know
about that.

40:23.830 --> 40:26.651
That's my girl, dawg.
Tell her everything.

40:26.660 --> 40:29.322
-Okay, everybody know?
Who else know?

40:29.370 --> 40:31.827
Frantz know? Oskar know?
-No, they don't know yet.

40:31.830 --> 40:34.867
I'm still trying to work
on a few details, so...

40:34.950 --> 40:36.497
-All right.
That's what's up.

40:37.500 --> 40:39.149
That's what's up.

40:39.160 --> 40:41.321
This business is a big step up
for this community, dawg.

40:41.370 --> 40:43.907
And I ain't talking about
no Lance Cherelus bullshit.

40:43.950 --> 40:46.327
I ain't for no bearded,
skinny-jean-wearing cracker

40:46.410 --> 40:48.150
moving up in this neighborhood,
be turning this place

40:48.160 --> 40:50.572
into Wynwood.
You feel me?

40:50.620 --> 40:54.579
-That's what's up,
but here's the deal.

40:54.620 --> 40:57.077
Both you and Lance,
you gotta be outta your mind,

40:57.120 --> 40:58.906
thinking all that cheddar
gonna be moving through here

40:58.950 --> 41:01.407
without it coming
through me first.
Coming through Jey.

41:07.160 --> 41:08.570
-Let me ask you this then.

41:10.580 --> 41:12.400
Who went and decided that part?

41:13.660 --> 41:14.740
-What's that, bruh?

41:16.040 --> 41:17.780
-This neighborhood
don't need no king.

41:18.830 --> 41:20.149
So who decided--

41:22.160 --> 41:25.493
-When's the last time
you actually opened your eyes
and looked around, dawg?

41:25.500 --> 41:28.742
We in a war.
This hood don't need
no Lance Cherelus.

41:28.790 --> 41:31.327
This hood don't need
no Mark Cuban.

41:31.330 --> 41:33.946
Man, this hood need
a general! A king!

41:41.910 --> 41:43.070
- Hey.

41:44.660 --> 41:45.695
-Wanna play Transformers?

41:45.750 --> 41:46.785
-Mm-hmm.
-Come on.

41:46.830 --> 41:50.903
-I think it's time
that you get going.

41:51.000 --> 41:54.151
-You gonna kick me out
of your dinner table like that?
-I never invited you.

42:02.950 --> 42:04.656
-You gotta respect
a man home, right?

42:07.660 --> 42:08.900
But here's what's up.

42:11.790 --> 42:14.031
You either with me
or you against me.

42:15.370 --> 42:18.157
You against me,
Tam against me.

42:22.500 --> 42:26.948
You against me,
your boy against me.

42:27.000 --> 42:30.197
And that's
a whole lot of against me
I gotta deal with now.

42:39.830 --> 42:43.493
Thanks for the food, Tam.
It was so delicious.

43:46.330 --> 43:49.788
- Turn back,
remember that we had

43:49.830 --> 43:52.446
A pact,
was never broken

43:55.250 --> 43:57.536
Let the players play

43:57.580 --> 43:59.696
It's the boy's birthday

43:59.750 --> 44:01.035
If they're hungry

44:01.080 --> 44:04.152
Then just let them
eat cake

44:04.200 --> 44:06.327
That's how I get my bang

44:06.330 --> 44:08.537
- We're going darker ages

44:08.620 --> 44:10.827
- That's how I get my bang

44:10.830 --> 44:12.991
- I wanna feel outrageous

44:13.000 --> 44:15.616
- That's how I get my bang

44:15.660 --> 44:17.821
- I feel it, the real id

44:17.910 --> 44:22.028
- That's how I get my bang

44:22.080 --> 44:25.572
Turn back,
all that we love

44:25.620 --> 44:29.943
Still intact, mm-hmm

44:31.450 --> 44:32.610
No getting it right

44:32.660 --> 44:34.150
No getting wrong

44:34.200 --> 44:38.648
Just getting it on

44:40.500 --> 44:42.650
That's how I get my bang

44:42.700 --> 44:44.782
- We're making mega fauna

44:44.830 --> 44:47.287
- That's how I get my bang

44:47.330 --> 44:49.195
- And I can tell you wanna

44:49.290 --> 44:51.781
- That's how I get my bang

44:51.830 --> 44:53.946
- I feel it, the real id

44:54.000 --> 44:57.902
- That's how I get my bang
