WEBVTT

00:10.524 --> 00:12.291
No, we're not there yet,

00:12.292 --> 00:15.027
but it should be just past
this ridge, Bumblebee.

00:22.803 --> 00:24.670
I don't get it.

00:24.671 --> 00:26.572
These readings
are off the meter.

00:28.000 --> 00:34.074

00:38.151 --> 00:41.053
I told you, doc, we're fine.

00:41.054 --> 00:43.823
The only way to be certain
you're fine, bulkhead,

00:43.824 --> 00:46.659
is to endure standard
defrosting procedure.

00:46.660 --> 00:49.929
You know prolonged exposure
to sub-zero conditions

00:49.930 --> 00:52.298
can cause permanent
system damage.

00:52.299 --> 00:54.967
Ratchet, have you learned
anything more

00:54.968 --> 00:56.469
about our arctic find?

00:56.470 --> 00:57.837
Not yet.

00:57.838 --> 01:01.707
The pod can't be opened
while it's frozen solid.

01:15.586 --> 01:19.225
Sync by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

02:05.979 --> 02:08.646
Arcee and I will search
for any clue

02:08.648 --> 02:11.884
which might explain the origin
of our arctic find.

02:11.885 --> 02:14.520
Only until your sensors sound.

02:14.521 --> 02:16.889
Remember,
once your core temperature

02:16.890 --> 02:18.491
drops into the blue zone,

02:18.492 --> 02:20.893
<i>system failures
aren't likely --</i>

02:20.894 --> 02:22.495
<i>They're imminent.</i>

02:26.399 --> 02:28.033
Miss us, doc bot?

02:28.034 --> 02:30.569
Shouldn't they be in school?

02:30.570 --> 02:31.904
On Saturday?

02:31.905 --> 02:35.040
We have the whole weekend off
to spend with you.

02:35.041 --> 02:37.843
I wasn't expecting to carpool.

02:37.844 --> 02:39.111
What gives, Arcee?

02:39.112 --> 02:40.246
Tag team, Jack.

02:40.247 --> 02:42.681
It's my turn
for exploration duty.

02:42.682 --> 02:43.983
Oh, too bad.

02:43.984 --> 02:45.885
It's a beautiful day
for a ride.

02:45.886 --> 02:48.988
Would hate for you to feel
guilty for leaving me indoors.

02:48.989 --> 02:51.023
<i>Arctic exploration duty.</i>

02:51.024 --> 02:52.992
Indoors where it's warm.

02:52.993 --> 02:56.595
The arctic? I've always
wanted to see snow.

02:56.596 --> 02:59.298
I would invite you to join,
Rafael,

02:59.299 --> 03:02.334
but the conditions
are much too extreme,

03:02.335 --> 03:04.770
even for we autobots.

03:04.771 --> 03:07.039
I...Understand.

03:09.042 --> 03:12.778
But I will bring you back
a snowball.

03:12.779 --> 03:14.213
That would be awesome.

03:19.619 --> 03:21.754
Transport complete.

03:23.423 --> 03:26.392
By the allspark!

03:28.295 --> 03:31.163
So, what do you guys think
we should do today?

03:34.000 --> 03:37.002
Video game tournament!
Last one standing wins!

03:37.003 --> 03:38.971
Bulkhead, Bumblebee!

03:38.972 --> 03:40.806
Here! Now!

03:47.314 --> 03:49.181
Prepare to be destroyed.

03:49.182 --> 03:52.918
Yeah,
not really my thing, Miko.

03:52.919 --> 03:55.554
Oh?
Scared of losing?

03:55.555 --> 03:57.456
To a girl?

03:57.457 --> 03:59.558
Bring it!

03:59.559 --> 04:01.894
No mercy.

04:03.363 --> 04:05.564
Hey, raf...

04:05.565 --> 04:07.399
You want to take on Miko
for me?

04:07.400 --> 04:09.401
Nah.

04:09.402 --> 04:12.871
I have stuff to do.

04:12.872 --> 04:15.174
Hoo-yeah!

04:16.942 --> 04:19.678
You can't boss us around
just because the boss is out.

04:19.678 --> 04:22.915
I need some heavy lifting.
The ground bridge is down.

04:25.151 --> 04:27.553
Optimus and Arcee
made it through just fine.

04:27.554 --> 04:29.655
<i>It's bringing them back
that concerns me.</i>

04:29.656 --> 04:31.890
Now, remove those panels --
Chop-chop.

04:36.129 --> 04:38.931
Temperatures sub-zero
and dropping.

04:38.932 --> 04:41.967
Got to...Get back...

04:41.968 --> 04:43.402
To base!

04:54.414 --> 04:56.148
Hello?

05:10.664 --> 05:13.265
Where did you come from?

05:17.137 --> 05:19.538
The autobots never said
anything about pets.

05:20.940 --> 05:22.508
You want to play fetch?

05:27.914 --> 05:30.182
Good boy.
Go get it!

05:32.952 --> 05:37.323
No! Don't eat that!
You're gonna choke!

05:37.324 --> 05:39.091
Or...Not.

05:53.139 --> 05:55.974
Ah, come on. Come on.
You want some?

05:57.344 --> 05:59.244
In...Your...Face!

06:00.980 --> 06:02.548
Whoa!
What the...?!

06:02.549 --> 06:04.416
Great.
Power failure.

06:04.417 --> 06:07.586
Aw.
It wiped out our game.

06:09.422 --> 06:11.824
But I was winning!

06:11.825 --> 06:13.292
Bummer.

06:15.695 --> 06:18.130
We most definitely
have a problem.

06:18.131 --> 06:20.632
But what could have
caused this?

06:20.633 --> 06:22.000
Or that?

06:22.001 --> 06:23.569
Might be the main grid.

06:23.570 --> 06:26.472
Hopefully, it isn't
a substation malfunction.

06:26.473 --> 06:28.774
Hey, guys.
Look what I found.

06:28.775 --> 06:31.009
We're busy!
Aah!

06:33.580 --> 06:35.681
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

06:35.682 --> 06:38.217
Hey, hey!
What's with you guys?

06:38.218 --> 06:40.152
Scraplet! Scraplet!

06:40.153 --> 06:41.987
What's a Scraplet?

06:41.988 --> 06:43.756
The most dangerous vermin

06:43.757 --> 06:46.125
ever to crawl
upon the face of Cybertron.

06:48.061 --> 06:50.863
This?
Are you kidding me?

06:50.864 --> 06:52.765
You're giant robots.

06:52.766 --> 06:55.067
Scrappy here is...
Teeny.

06:55.068 --> 06:58.704
You have no idea of the damage
that teeny thing can do!

06:58.705 --> 07:02.541
Aw, he wouldn't hurt anything.

07:33.476 --> 07:35.844
Whoa, easy there, killer.

07:38.715 --> 07:41.350
Whoa. I did not
see that coming.

07:41.351 --> 07:43.952
I'm sorry, Bumblebee.

07:45.255 --> 07:46.622
Is he gonna be okay?

07:46.623 --> 07:49.858
Only a mesh wound.
He'll live.

07:49.859 --> 07:51.560
<i>Now do you believe me?</i>

07:51.561 --> 07:53.729
All Scraplets do
is dismantle machinery

07:53.730 --> 07:57.699
<i>and eat anything metal --
Especially living metal.</i>

07:57.700 --> 08:01.069
Well, bug squashed,
game over, right?

08:01.070 --> 08:02.437
No.

08:02.438 --> 08:06.174
When it comes to Scraplets,
there's never just one.

08:06.175 --> 08:10.279
And I fear I know
how they got in here.

08:12.615 --> 08:15.918
It's a trap --
A Scraplet trap.

08:15.919 --> 08:19.488
<i>Uh, an empty Scraplet trap.</i>

08:19.489 --> 08:23.058
Most likely ejected
into space eons ago,

08:23.059 --> 08:25.027
only to wind up in the arctic,

08:25.028 --> 08:27.596
where the temperature
kept them in stasis.

08:27.597 --> 08:29.364
Until we brought the thaw.

08:29.365 --> 08:32.100
Now they're wide awake
and ready to brunch.

08:32.101 --> 08:35.703
So...How many
are we talking about?

08:35.705 --> 08:37.205
Thousands.

08:37.206 --> 08:40.375
And the power malfunctions
and ground bridge damage

08:40.376 --> 08:45.480
are sure signs that their
infestation is well underway.

08:54.691 --> 08:57.292
Arcee, what's your status?

08:57.293 --> 08:59.962
My sensor's going off.

08:59.963 --> 09:02.564
Guess we should call for pickup
before things get chilly.

09:02.565 --> 09:04.800
Optimus to base,

09:04.801 --> 09:07.469
core temperature readings
have reached the blue zone.

09:07.470 --> 09:09.805
Prepare to activate
ground bridge.

09:14.477 --> 09:16.712
Ratchet to Optimus,
do you read me?

09:16.713 --> 09:18.747
We have a situation.

09:18.748 --> 09:21.984
The Scraplets have gotten
into the com-link system!

09:21.985 --> 09:24.820
If we don't eradicate
these creatures immediately,

09:24.821 --> 09:28.590
they will reduce the entire base
to a scrap heap!

09:28.591 --> 09:30.592
I say we bug out of here
and let them keep it!

09:31.728 --> 09:34.029
Evacuation is not an option.

09:34.030 --> 09:37.432
If we don't get the
ground bridge back online stat,

09:37.433 --> 09:40.102
Optimus and Arcee will perish.

09:40.103 --> 09:41.570
They...Will?

09:43.539 --> 09:46.074
Bulkhead, you never run!

09:46.075 --> 09:48.443
Miko, you haven't seen
a swarm of these things

09:48.444 --> 09:49.945
devour a bot.

09:49.946 --> 09:51.680
I have.

09:51.681 --> 09:54.716
They pick you apart
from the inside out,

09:54.717 --> 09:57.653
going for the small,
juicy bits first --

09:57.654 --> 10:00.822
Fuse by fuse,
circuit by circuit,

10:00.823 --> 10:02.691
till there's nothing left,

10:02.692 --> 10:05.060
<i>and I mean nothing...</i>

10:05.061 --> 10:07.462
Not even your optics.

10:09.132 --> 10:10.832
You have to let us help.

10:10.833 --> 10:13.035
We're not made of metal.

10:13.036 --> 10:15.203
Yeah.
The Scraplets can't hurt us.

10:15.204 --> 10:17.506
Typically,
I find your fleshiness

10:17.507 --> 10:19.975
to be your
least engaging quality...

10:19.976 --> 10:24.046
But it would appear
to provide an advantage

10:24.047 --> 10:25.781
under these extremes.

10:25.782 --> 10:27.115
Okay, good.

10:27.116 --> 10:29.418
So we pair off --
One bot, one human.

10:29.419 --> 10:31.853
I'll watch your back while
you repair the ground bridge.

10:31.854 --> 10:34.256
And we go on a bug hunt.

10:35.825 --> 10:38.160
Oh, boy.

10:43.266 --> 10:46.234
Optimus to base.
Do you read?

10:50.339 --> 10:52.908
Are you sure a nice long drive
wouldn't help?

10:52.909 --> 10:55.210
I hear Miami's beautiful
this time of year.

10:55.211 --> 10:58.480
The nearest temperate climate
is too distant, Arcee.

10:58.481 --> 11:01.550
Attempting to reach it
would expend too much energy

11:01.551 --> 11:04.386
and hasten
the freezing process.

11:04.387 --> 11:09.057
<i>Until Ratchet sends for us --
And he will --</i>

11:09.058 --> 11:11.827
Our best option would be
to seek shelter

11:11.828 --> 11:13.829
and insulate ourselves.

11:13.830 --> 11:16.965
<i>I get to be your bodyguard
for once.</i>

11:16.966 --> 11:18.734
How cool is that?!

11:18.735 --> 11:21.837
Raf found the first one here,
right?

11:23.639 --> 11:26.041
Did you just scream
like a little girl?

11:26.042 --> 11:27.375
No!

11:27.376 --> 11:29.044
Maybe.

11:29.045 --> 11:30.946
Can we talk about this later?

11:40.690 --> 11:43.091
Take 'er easy, bulkhead.
Just stay focused.

11:43.092 --> 11:44.359
Everything's
gonna be --

11:52.135 --> 11:54.703
Aah! Look out!
Aaaah!

11:54.704 --> 11:57.139
<i>Okay.
Wish I hadn't seen that.</i>

11:57.140 --> 12:01.176
Bulkhead, you're fine.
It's just a bunch of cables.

12:02.845 --> 12:05.814
Oh. Right. Cables.

12:17.460 --> 12:19.928
Don't these things
ever stop eating?

12:50.159 --> 12:52.928
How's it going over there?

12:54.230 --> 12:56.031
I've repaired
the damaged conductors

12:56.032 --> 12:57.933
and rerouted
the central conduits,

12:57.934 --> 13:01.436
but the ground bridge
still won't receive power!

13:24.064 --> 13:27.600
They fly?!
You never said they could fly!

13:34.474 --> 13:36.175
Ratchet!

13:46.419 --> 13:48.053
The fire extinguisher!

14:11.077 --> 14:13.646
Ratchet, get the patch kit.

14:13.647 --> 14:15.914
We're leaking energon
like -- Whoa!

14:25.292 --> 14:27.092
<i>Eat this!</i>

14:51.584 --> 14:55.154
Arcee, wake up.

14:55.155 --> 14:58.524
Just resting my eyes.

14:58.525 --> 15:03.362
The longer we remain alert,
the longer we remain alive.

15:03.363 --> 15:04.697
What do you suggest?

15:04.698 --> 15:07.333
Wait.
How about a game?

15:07.334 --> 15:11.603
Let's play "who screwed
things up back at base?"

15:11.604 --> 15:16.175
Our predicament could be the
result of a simple malfunction.

15:16.176 --> 15:18.210
Caused by bulkhead.

15:18.211 --> 15:20.212
Let's see.

15:20.213 --> 15:22.981
No com-link.
Maybe even no power.

15:22.982 --> 15:25.718
The big lug probably
tripped over a cord.

15:25.719 --> 15:27.820
He's never been too graceful.

15:27.821 --> 15:29.955
Remember when we
first arrived on earth

15:29.956 --> 15:32.291
and bulkhead walked
into those power lines?

15:33.727 --> 15:35.527
Who knew he could dance
like that?

15:35.528 --> 15:39.798
Bulkhead may be...
Too large for this world,

15:39.799 --> 15:43.369
but his inner strength
is without bounds.

15:43.370 --> 15:47.506
One should not be measured
by size alone.

15:57.984 --> 15:59.885
We get them all?

16:10.196 --> 16:11.697
Hardly.

16:11.698 --> 16:13.532
These were just scouts.

16:15.969 --> 16:19.171
So, the rest of them
know we're in here?

16:19.172 --> 16:22.207
And if we allow ourselves
to become their next meal,

16:22.208 --> 16:25.277
Optimus and Arcee
will never make it home.

16:25.278 --> 16:28.781
We must get the ground bridge
operational.

16:28.782 --> 16:32.184
Then we can use it to send
the Scraplets anywhere on earth.

16:32.185 --> 16:33.819
Why not back to the arctic?

16:33.820 --> 16:35.821
We already know
they don't do cold.

16:35.822 --> 16:37.990
Sweet!
One-stop shopping.

16:37.991 --> 16:40.092
Given the body mass
of the Scraplets,

16:40.093 --> 16:43.662
sub-zero temperature
should freeze them on contact.

16:43.663 --> 16:46.465
So think, Ratchet.
Think!

16:46.466 --> 16:49.668
If the ground bridge
is still down,

16:49.669 --> 16:53.806
there must be a breach
in the energon fuel line.

16:58.378 --> 17:00.546
<i>If we weren't breaching,</i>

17:00.547 --> 17:03.449
one of us could get
back over there and fix it.

17:03.450 --> 17:04.983
Where do we find it?

17:04.983 --> 17:07.219
And how do we fix it?

17:10.890 --> 17:13.425
Remember, we're okay.

17:13.425 --> 17:15.394
We're not metal.

17:16.996 --> 17:18.830
There's the breach.

17:18.832 --> 17:20.833
Come on.

17:20.834 --> 17:23.135
We have to work fast.

17:24.838 --> 17:26.972
So, if we get --

17:26.973 --> 17:29.741
<i>When we get
the ground bridge open,</i>

17:29.742 --> 17:32.778
do we send
the creepy-crawlies out

17:32.779 --> 17:35.113
or bring our bots in?

17:35.114 --> 17:38.016
Optimus and Arcee
will be fresh meat.

17:38.017 --> 17:39.685
If we bring them in first,

17:39.686 --> 17:41.787
the Scraplets will have
no reason to leave.

17:41.788 --> 17:44.356
We'll need bait.

17:44.357 --> 17:45.924
Where are we gonna get bait?!

17:45.925 --> 17:47.593
The Scraplets already
helped themselves

17:47.594 --> 17:48.927
to everything in here!

17:56.236 --> 17:57.903
They're getting ready to feed!

18:08.581 --> 18:10.349
You know the worst part?

18:10.350 --> 18:13.018
After battling 'cons
all these years --

18:13.019 --> 18:15.988
Getting smacked down,
shot at, blown up --

18:15.989 --> 18:18.891
<i>This is how our lights go out?</i>

18:18.892 --> 18:24.963
Arcee, this may not be
the finish that we had planned,

18:24.964 --> 18:28.567
but if this is indeed the end,

18:28.568 --> 18:32.437
if we are to become one
with the allspark...

18:37.577 --> 18:42.214
It's been an honor serving
with you, Optimus prime.

18:44.284 --> 18:47.719
Ratchet, all systems go!

18:47.720 --> 18:49.054
Fire it up!

18:50.823 --> 18:52.724
Ground bridge...

18:52.725 --> 18:55.027
Activated.

19:11.644 --> 19:13.545
Bait, huh?

19:18.551 --> 19:20.319
Ready for the main course?

19:22.055 --> 19:23.589
Come and get it!

19:47.213 --> 19:50.148
Down! Down!

20:20.913 --> 20:24.983
I'd invite you in,
but the place is a mess.

20:37.864 --> 20:40.399
Report
bio-circuitry status.

20:40.400 --> 20:41.833
Levels are rising.

20:41.834 --> 20:43.001
Excellent.

20:43.002 --> 20:45.037
Rafael, keep a close watch

20:45.038 --> 20:47.172
on Bumblebee's
electro-pulse monitor.

20:47.173 --> 20:50.175
Miko, check bulkhead's
interface patch.

20:50.176 --> 20:52.511
It's steady.
Looking good.

20:52.512 --> 20:56.548
<i>Perhaps you should get some rest
yourself, old friend.</i>

20:56.549 --> 20:59.518
You saved quite a few lives
today.

20:59.519 --> 21:02.120
It...
Wasn't all my doing.

21:04.524 --> 21:08.093
We're just fortunate that
this infestation happened...

21:08.094 --> 21:10.095
On a Saturday.

21:10.096 --> 21:13.432
Our human friends may be small,

21:13.433 --> 21:15.233
but they are strong.

21:18.337 --> 21:19.638
Scraplet?!

21:19.639 --> 21:21.640
Spider!
Is it on me?!

21:23.743 --> 21:25.711
Aah! Get off!

21:25.712 --> 21:29.201
Did she just scream
like a little girl?

21:30.945 --> 21:35.230
