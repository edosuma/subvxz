09:28.569 --> 09:29.717
Oh, sweetie.

09:29.811 --> 09:32.720
It sounds like you just need
to slow down.

09:32.739 --> 09:34.147
(sighs)

09:34.299 --> 09:37.058
I actually have
six identical Ferraris.

09:37.077 --> 09:39.652

all the blue ones.

09:39.821 --> 09:41.496
(crying)

09:42.398 --> 09:43.990
I know what's wrong with you.

09:44.142 --> 09:45.992
Not enough Ferraris.

09:46.144 --> 09:48.812
What this boy needs
is a home-cooked meal

09:48.830 --> 09:50.814
and a good night's sleep.

09:50.832 --> 09:52.073
At my house.

09:52.167 --> 09:54.909
A partnership
betwixt a man and a woman

09:54.986 --> 09:57.411
to provide for the care
of a young person.

09:57.505 --> 09:59.505
You supply
the nurturing home life,

09:59.658 --> 10:01.433
and I'll be
the emotionally-withholding

10:01.584 --> 10:03.660

father figure.

10:03.678 --> 10:05.829
It's a deal.

10:05.847 --> 10:07.664
You're coming home with me.

10:07.757 --> 10:08.681
I really want to,

10:08.775 --> 10:10.108
but I'm kind of supposed
to get into it

10:10.259 --> 10:12.518
with some hockey players
outside a strip club later.

10:12.671 --> 10:15.447
I'll call them
and tell them you're sick.

10:17.843 --> 10:20.026
Yo. Two parents and some kids?

10:20.178 --> 10:22.287
This is a straight-up family.

10:22.364 --> 10:23.529
For real.

10:23.624 --> 10:25.457
I guess we are.

10:25.684 --> 10:28.943
So, Grayson, you just graduated
from college, right?

10:28.962 --> 10:30.629
What did you major in?

10:30.780 --> 10:32.038
Oh, they never told me.

10:32.190 --> 10:35.041
(sighs)
That means communications.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.543
You see, I grew up
on the Florida-Texas border,

10:37.638 --> 10:39.379
where football is king.

10:39.531 --> 10:42.289
<i> One day, I saw this other baby</i>
<i> crawling a post pattern,</i>

10:42.384 --> 10:43.883
<i>and I hit him with my pacifier.</i>

10:44.035 --> 10:46.293
<i> Perfect spiral. 20 yards.</i>

10:46.313 --> 10:48.554
<i> My folks did what</i>
<i> any loving parents would do--</i>

10:48.707 --> 10:50.815
<i> they packed me off</i>
<i> to football academy.</i>

10:50.967 --> 10:52.375
<i> I'm real grateful.</i>

10:52.394 --> 10:54.727
<i> If you keep a kid at home</i>
<i> till he's two,</i>

10:54.821 --> 10:56.379
<i>it can screw up his development.</i>

10:57.382 --> 10:59.140
<i> Growing up in an</i>
<i> all-football environment</i>

10:59.217 --> 11:02.385
<i>helped me avoid the distractions</i>
<i> that come with being a kid--</i>

11:02.478 --> 11:04.979
<i> friends, laughing, that junk.</i>

11:05.073 --> 11:07.999
<i> For college, Alabama Tech</i>
<i> was an easy choice.</i>

11:08.076 --> 11:10.059
<i> Coach is an amazing recruiter.</i>

11:10.078 --> 11:11.986
<i> You really feel his passion.</i>

11:12.063 --> 11:15.156
Wait, so you never
see your parents?

11:15.250 --> 11:16.916
Oh, I see them all the time!

11:17.010 --> 11:17.917
<i> I see them at games,</i>

11:18.011 --> 11:19.585
<i> in documentaries about me,</i>

11:19.738 --> 11:20.753
<i> in the Campbell's Soup</i>
<i> commercial</i>

11:20.830 --> 11:22.922
<i>my mom did without my knowledge.</i>

11:23.074 --> 11:24.498
Oh, Grayson,

11:24.518 --> 11:26.500
growing up with nothing
but football

11:26.520 --> 11:28.244
can't have been healthy.

No, no, I'm good.

coaches and minders

11:57.776 --> 12:01.202
watching your every move doesn't
mean you can act selfishly.

12:01.296 --> 12:04.447
In a family, you don't do you.

Grayson Mathers.

19:19.993 --> 19:21.066
-♪ ♪
-(cheering, applause)

19:22.162 --> 19:24.978
You all know I've had
some personal struggles lately.

19:24.998 --> 19:28.482
I was losing
the football game of emotions.

19:28.501 --> 19:31.002
But there's one person
who got me through it.

19:31.153 --> 19:32.503
He's talking about you.

19:32.655 --> 19:33.896
You're the nurturer.

19:34.065 --> 19:36.007
But you're his inspiration.

19:36.158 --> 19:37.758
It's got to be you.

19:38.753 --> 19:39.752
(groans)

19:39.921 --> 19:41.070
And that person is...

19:41.088 --> 19:44.924
-my fiancée Kaitlyn!
-(all gasp)

19:45.018 --> 19:47.410
The three days I've known her
have seemed like a lifetime.

19:47.428 --> 19:50.079
An Instagram model,
a YouTube reactor

19:50.172 --> 19:52.172
and the creator of Yoga Yogurt,

19:52.192 --> 19:54.433
the faith-based yogurt
you eat while yoga-ing.

19:54.527 --> 19:57.344
Kaitlyn is so much more
than a business manager to me.

19:57.438 --> 20:00.089
Though she's that, too!
As of this morning!

20:00.182 --> 20:02.867
Hope you can handle
total financial control, baby!

20:03.094 --> 20:04.260
Good news, babe!

20:04.353 --> 20:05.778
You're fighting Floyd Mayweather

20:05.930 --> 20:07.930
on a Valentine's Day
pay-per-view!

20:07.949 --> 20:09.432
(whoops)

20:09.450 --> 20:11.100
She's getting me out
of the brandy business,

20:11.118 --> 20:13.285
into something
more wholesome, y'all:

20:13.438 --> 20:16.380
our new line
of all-ages hard seltzers.

20:16.499 --> 20:18.216
@Katilicious_97,

20:18.367 --> 20:20.033
I can't wait to marry you.

20:20.127 --> 20:21.610
Tell me there's a prenup.

20:21.629 --> 20:22.611
No prenup!

20:22.630 --> 20:24.280
That's how I roll!

20:24.298 --> 20:26.206
Who wants some seltzers?

20:26.226 --> 20:27.374
Dime for you!

20:27.393 --> 20:29.969
And just like that,
we've been replaced.

20:30.063 --> 20:32.921
One day, they're these sweet,
innocent creatures

20:32.923 --> 20:34.974
who are totally reliant on you.

20:35.126 --> 20:37.476
Then, suddenly,
it's two weeks later

20:37.628 --> 20:39.612
and they're gone.

20:51.734 --> 20:54.252
