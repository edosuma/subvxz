wool and linen together.

00:03.360 --> 00:05.520
"When men fight one another,

00:05.520 --> 00:07.960
"and the wife of one draws near

00:07.960 --> 00:09.680
"from the hand of him

"you shall cut off her hand.

"You shall not lie with a male

00:16.560 --> 00:18.720
"It is an abomination."

00:18.720 --> 00:21.120
All verses from the Old Testament,

00:21.120 --> 00:25.600
since perfected by Christ's new law
of love and forgiveness.

00:25.600 --> 00:29.280
What is the value of outdated
rituals and conventions,

00:29.280 --> 00:32.720
of attitudes that condemn more
people than they save?

00:32.720 --> 00:35.640
I am imploring you, imploring us...

00:35.640 --> 00:38.760
to perfect our rules
in the same way.

00:38.760 --> 00:40.600
And to reaffirm our commitment

00:40.600 --> 00:43.400
to redemption,
to compassion, to love.

00:43.400 --> 00:48.000
And be a force for change in
the law, the country and ourselves.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.840
I think it's admirable
to demand change.

00:50.840 --> 00:54.160
But a shepherd has to be conscious
of how fast his flock can move.

00:54.160 --> 00:56.320
Too fast, and some may fall behind.

00:56.320 --> 00:58.240
And too slow,
and we'll be left in the dark.

00:59.880 --> 01:01.480
Good morning, Bishop.

01:01.480 --> 01:03.240
Mr Jones.

01:03.240 --> 01:06.280
Mr Davenport, thank you
for sending me your speech.

01:06.280 --> 01:08.800
But I'm afraid
you won't be speaking today.

01:08.800 --> 01:12.120
Attitudes to sexual morality
are not on the agenda this year.

01:12.120 --> 01:13.680
I have a right to speak.

01:15.320 --> 01:18.000
They're taking their seats,
Mr Jones.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.480
Bishop.

01:21.800 --> 01:23.520
I'll be making an appointment

01:23.520 --> 01:25.920
to visit your parish
in the next day or two.

01:25.920 --> 01:29.200
I'll need to take everything
into account, so it would be wise

01:29.200 --> 01:30.960
not to have any more
half-naked girls

01:30.960 --> 01:33.520
parading themselves when I visit.
That was my sist...

01:34.840 --> 01:36.040
How do you...?

01:42.520 --> 01:45.400
Rules, reputations -
that is all they care about.

01:45.400 --> 01:46.800
Well, if they don't wanna change,

01:46.800 --> 01:49.400
then maybe I don't
want to be there anyway. Drink?

01:49.400 --> 01:51.280
Have you been listening?

01:51.280 --> 01:54.000
SIGHS
It's a job, Will.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.560
And sometimes jobs have rules
that you don't agree with.

01:57.560 --> 01:59.120
Trust me, I know.

01:59.120 --> 02:00.760
KNOCKING

02:00.760 --> 02:03.200
There's a call, a woman saying
her husband attacked her.

02:03.200 --> 02:04.440
Where?

02:04.440 --> 02:06.240
What, a domestic? Send Larry.

02:06.240 --> 02:08.600
Er, she asked for you specifically.

02:22.920 --> 02:24.520
Nice place.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.800
So was mine, from the outside.

Oh, sorry!
I'll be with you in a minute.

CLANGING CONTINUES

02:43.200 --> 02:44.880
Rita Daltrey?

02:46.880 --> 02:48.560
Sorry, sir, I'm just the maid.

02:48.560 --> 02:50.960
Is Mrs Daltrey all right?
No, no, no, no!

02:50.960 --> 02:55.200
Dorie, you need to ask me to disable
it before you open the door!

02:55.200 --> 02:57.040
CLANGING CONTINUES

02:57.040 --> 02:58.560
Mr Daltrey, poli...

02:58.560 --> 02:59.840
CLANGING CONTINUES

02:59.840 --> 03:02.840
Apologies, gentlemen. I just
need to telephone your station.

03:02.840 --> 03:04.160
It's connected directly.

03:04.160 --> 03:07.720
CLANGING CONTINUES
Dorie... where's Rita?

03:07.720 --> 03:10.480
Ah, hello.
Er, yes, this is Gene Daltrey.

03:10.480 --> 03:13.400
No, false alarm, I'm afraid.

03:13.400 --> 03:15.320
Thank you.

03:15.320 --> 03:17.760
CLANGING CONTINUES
Rita.

03:17.760 --> 03:19.880
CLANGING STOPS
What's happening here?

03:19.880 --> 03:24.360
Er, she tripped on the stairs.
Hit her face on the banister.

03:26.840 --> 03:28.800
Is it bad?

03:28.800 --> 03:30.920
I'm still beautiful, aren't I?

03:30.920 --> 03:32.760
Of course you are!

03:32.760 --> 03:34.440
You're my sunny girl.

03:34.440 --> 03:36.160
You always will be.

03:36.160 --> 03:38.760
DOORBELL RINGS
Ah, that'll be the doctor.

03:38.760 --> 03:40.120
Get that, will you, Dorie?

03:41.560 --> 03:44.560
Mrs Daltrey, can you tell us,
in your own words,

03:44.560 --> 03:46.680
how you received that injury?
FRONT DOOR OPENS

03:46.680 --> 03:48.880
It's as Gene said.

03:48.880 --> 03:51.920
But you told the operator
you were being attacked.

03:51.920 --> 03:53.760
Must've been the bump on the head.

03:53.760 --> 03:55.440
And possibly the gin and tonics.

03:56.560 --> 03:58.640
Thank you, Dorie.

03:59.680 --> 04:01.200
Oh, not again!

04:01.200 --> 04:03.240
I'm sorry, Doctor.

04:05.440 --> 04:07.840
So, you're a singer?
Yes

04:07.840 --> 04:11.320
The best in clubland.
The magic's in the production.

04:11.320 --> 04:13.880
That's where my husband's
talents are.

04:13.880 --> 04:16.880
Doctor, do Rita's injuries
look consistent with a fall

04:16.880 --> 04:19.440
or something else?
Perhaps a strike with a fist?

04:19.440 --> 04:23.080
Oh, now, hang on...
DOCTOR: Well, it's a large bruise.

04:23.080 --> 04:24.760
Even contact.

04:24.760 --> 04:27.360
So more likely a banister.

04:27.360 --> 04:29.360
Er, yes.

04:29.360 --> 04:31.200
I'd say so, yes.

04:31.200 --> 04:34.240
Inspector. Er, Vicar.

04:35.280 --> 04:37.800
I understand how this looks,
and I appreciate your concern.

04:37.800 --> 04:40.200
But please be assured...

04:40.200 --> 04:42.080
it was an accident.

04:42.080 --> 04:43.880
Take these.

04:43.880 --> 04:45.320
And rest.

04:51.600 --> 04:54.560
We can't just leave her in there.
Just give it a sec.

04:57.440 --> 04:58.800
Inspector!

05:00.760 --> 05:02.200
Your hat.

05:04.120 --> 05:06.040
What really happened?

05:06.040 --> 05:07.680
I didn't see nothing, sir.

05:08.680 --> 05:10.120
Madam asked me to give you this.

05:27.200 --> 05:28.680
What is it?

05:30.040 --> 05:31.680
It's Johnny's business card.

05:37.040 --> 05:38.080
Thanks for ringing.

05:38.080 --> 05:40.280
This is exactly why I told her
to ask for you.

05:40.280 --> 05:41.880
How long's it been going on for?

05:41.880 --> 05:43.640
HE SIGHS

05:43.640 --> 05:47.120
Will, listen,
I appreciate your interest.

05:47.120 --> 05:48.840
But Rita's a client,

05:48.840 --> 05:51.240
so I think it's better
if I speak to Geordie in private.

05:51.240 --> 05:53.400
I know situations like this.
Oh, don't worry.

05:54.520 --> 05:56.000
We'll nail the bastard.

05:58.400 --> 05:59.720
WILL SIGHS

06:03.760 --> 06:05.240
DOOR CLOSES

06:07.320 --> 06:08.960
I wish I could share your optimism.

06:10.040 --> 06:12.120
I've been trying to nail
Gene Daltrey for years.

06:13.400 --> 06:15.680
There's not much I can do, Johnny,
if Rita won't talk.

06:15.680 --> 06:18.480
I've been looking after her
since she was singing in pubs.

06:18.480 --> 06:19.880
Beautiful voice.

06:21.080 --> 06:24.560
But if she used it to speak out
against him, what would he get?

06:24.560 --> 06:26.360
A slap on the wrist, at best.

06:27.400 --> 06:28.840
So...?
So...

06:29.840 --> 06:32.560
..she wants to get away,
she wants to leave him.

06:32.560 --> 06:34.080
But she's scared.

06:35.920 --> 06:38.600
He's got this alarm.
Yeah, we heard it.

06:38.600 --> 06:40.880
Well, it's got nothing to do
with burglars.

06:40.880 --> 06:42.440
It's all about keeping her in.

06:43.480 --> 06:46.400
It's on a timer, connected directly
to here. And if you could...

06:48.440 --> 06:51.240
If you could find out
what time it goes on and off,

06:51.240 --> 06:53.120
I could help her escape.
What?

06:53.120 --> 06:54.600
He's got her trapped.

06:56.120 --> 06:59.480
Drunk, drugged up,
until he needs another record.

06:59.480 --> 07:01.720
Why can't she give you
the timings herself?

07:01.720 --> 07:03.360
Because she doesn't know them.

07:03.360 --> 07:05.560
He changes them,
and then he won't tell her.

07:07.280 --> 07:09.800
At least, when we were prisoners,
we had each other.

07:40.720 --> 07:42.200
Geordie.

07:42.200 --> 07:43.640
Johnny.

08:01.840 --> 08:03.480
Afang soup?

08:03.480 --> 08:06.480
It's full of vitamins.
Or mutton pie? Full of gravy.

08:06.480 --> 08:07.920
I'm not hungry, thanks.

08:07.920 --> 08:11.120
What's this about you
being thrown out of the conference?

08:11.120 --> 08:13.480
You just can't help yourself,
can you?

08:13.480 --> 08:15.480
Told you not to use that line
about private parts.

08:15.480 --> 08:17.200
I think it has less to do
with my speech

08:17.200 --> 08:19.920
than someone telling the Bishop
about Tamara being here.

08:19.920 --> 08:21.320
Well, it wasn't me.

08:21.320 --> 08:23.600
He's coming here
in the next few days.

08:23.600 --> 08:25.920
He wants me to reconsider
my position.

08:25.920 --> 08:28.320
It wasn't my intention
to get anyone in trouble.

08:28.320 --> 08:29.600
Of course not.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.320
Judas Iscariot!

08:39.840 --> 08:41.920
GROANS

08:48.080 --> 08:49.480
Morning.

09:04.960 --> 09:07.480
Let's arrest Rita Daltrey.
The rules are ridiculous,

09:07.480 --> 09:09.160
so we may as well make them
work for us.

09:09.160 --> 09:10.640
Arrest her for what?

09:10.640 --> 09:14.320
Er, making a false complaint.
At least then we can get her alone.

09:14.320 --> 09:17.120
I think we can move on
from that case, Will.

09:17.120 --> 09:18.480
SHARP KNOCKING

09:18.480 --> 09:20.560
There's a call from the same house
as yesterday.

The maid's hysterical.

CLANGING CONTINUES

09:49.920 --> 09:51.520
DORIE: Someone broke in last night.

09:52.840 --> 09:54.440
They shot Mr Gene.

09:54.440 --> 09:57.160
RITA SOBS INCONSOLABLY

10:07.600 --> 10:09.520
I woke up.

10:09.520 --> 10:11.800
I came downstairs and...

10:11.800 --> 10:14.600
found sir like this.

10:14.600 --> 10:19.240
I woke madam,
and then telephoned Dr Harvey.

10:19.240 --> 10:22.160
I thought...
maybe he could be saved.

10:22.160 --> 10:26.400
Sadly not.
He's been dead for a few hours now.

10:26.400 --> 10:28.440
But you didn't hear the gunshot?

10:28.440 --> 10:30.120
No, sir.

10:30.120 --> 10:32.760
LARRY: They could've used
a silencer.

10:32.760 --> 10:34.560
WILL: Mrs Daltrey...

10:34.560 --> 10:36.720
Rita...

10:36.720 --> 10:40.360
I never really woke up from
the pills Harvey gave me last night.

10:41.400 --> 10:43.600
You didn't hear the alarm either?

10:43.600 --> 10:45.760
DR HARVEY:
That started when I arrived.

10:45.760 --> 10:47.160
So the intruder must've got in

10:47.160 --> 10:49.600
before the alarm was put
on last night.

10:49.600 --> 10:51.080
What time did you go to bed, Dorie?

10:51.080 --> 10:54.120
Early. Around nine.

10:55.240 --> 10:57.920
So between nine
and when the alarm was put on,

10:57.920 --> 11:00.120
which we can get from the station.
Right, boss?

11:02.400 --> 11:04.080
Er, right.

11:04.080 --> 11:06.240
If there was an intruder.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.520
Of course there was.

11:08.520 --> 11:11.000
It's a robbery, weren't it?
Daltrey's walked in on them.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.840
Well, that's what it looks like.

11:12.840 --> 11:15.040
What are you getting at, Vicar?

11:15.040 --> 11:16.080
I'm just saying that

11:16.080 --> 11:18.680
we should explore all possibilities
at this stage.

11:18.680 --> 11:21.680
That's what the Inspector
usually says. Geordie?

11:23.560 --> 11:25.440
Er, Larry, have a look around.

11:25.440 --> 11:29.040
Check all the access points,
you know, broken locks, latches.

11:29.040 --> 11:32.160
And maybe we should continue
this conversation with Mrs Daltrey

11:32.160 --> 11:33.760
down at the police station.

11:33.760 --> 11:36.160
It must be very difficult
for her here.

11:36.160 --> 11:39.080
With your solicitor present,
of course.

11:48.520 --> 11:50.560
How's she doing?

11:50.560 --> 11:53.440
Well, her husband's just been
murdered. How do you think?

11:53.440 --> 11:55.000
Any idea who did it?

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
Well, it looks like a burglary,
but... Thanks, Will.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.800
She's Johnny's client, as you know.
I'm sure they'll want some privacy.

12:05.680 --> 12:08.880
Actually, it might be better
to have a man of the cloth present.

12:09.880 --> 12:11.800
She's just lost her husband,
as you said.

12:15.520 --> 12:16.920
Is she in here?

12:19.360 --> 12:21.000
KNOCKS

12:24.600 --> 12:27.680
As I understand, my client has
outlined her movements last night

12:27.680 --> 12:30.440
and the sad discovery of her husband
this morning.

12:30.440 --> 12:32.880
And you've invited her here

12:32.880 --> 12:36.080
to give a further witness statement
to the best of her knowledge.

12:38.680 --> 12:40.360
Yeah, that's right. Yeah.

12:40.360 --> 12:44.240
We're trying to establish exactly
what happened to Gene Daltrey.

12:44.240 --> 12:47.080
I told you, I was asleep.

12:47.080 --> 12:49.640
Rita, I can imagine
you're experiencing

12:49.640 --> 12:51.880
some quite conflicting emotions.

12:51.880 --> 12:53.560
Primarily shock...

12:54.960 --> 12:57.200
..and anguish, as anyone would feel,

12:57.200 --> 12:59.680
having lost their spouse
in such a...

12:59.680 --> 13:03.000
violent and unexpected way.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.840
Of course.

13:04.840 --> 13:07.240
But in light of your call
to the police yesterday...

13:07.240 --> 13:09.120
I don't see how that's relevant.

13:11.720 --> 13:15.800
Well, erm... if Mr Daltrey
did attack Mrs Daltrey,

13:15.800 --> 13:18.400
I could fully understand if...
Vicar.

13:18.400 --> 13:22.400
Are you saying that my client
is now a suspect...

13:23.920 --> 13:25.560
..rather than a witness?

13:27.840 --> 13:29.280
And didn't the call yesterday

13:29.280 --> 13:31.560
transpire to be nothing more
than an accident?

13:33.080 --> 13:36.360
You said yourself
that Rita had been a victim of abuse

13:36.360 --> 13:38.040
at the hands of Mr Daltrey.

13:41.680 --> 13:43.480
That was off the record.

13:43.480 --> 13:46.240
And not relevant to this case.

13:46.240 --> 13:49.160
You said it was a burglary.

13:49.160 --> 13:51.800
No, I said it LOOKED like
a burglary. Then, surely...

13:51.800 --> 13:54.000
that is the angle
you should be pursuing,

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
instead of making
baseless allegations

13:56.000 --> 13:58.160
against a grieving widow.
Gentlemen, please!

14:05.920 --> 14:09.280
My husband and I
had our ups and downs,

14:09.280 --> 14:11.040
like all couples, I'm sure.

14:12.040 --> 14:14.120
And sometimes I wish I had...

14:15.680 --> 14:17.080
..fought back.

14:19.080 --> 14:20.960
But the truth is...

14:22.920 --> 14:24.760
..I was never strong enough.

14:26.400 --> 14:28.120
Rita...
SHE SOBS

14:32.080 --> 14:34.280
SHE INHALES SHARPLY

14:44.560 --> 14:46.880
Did you see that?
Hmm?

14:46.880 --> 14:48.720
Well, she's a long-time client.

14:48.720 --> 14:51.120
The way he tried to railroad me.
So what?

14:54.120 --> 14:56.880
Look, er... take Rita home.

14:58.760 --> 15:01.320
I'll talk to Johnny.
DOOR OPENS

15:02.520 --> 15:04.160
Sorry about that, Will.

15:04.160 --> 15:07.640
But it's my job to protect
my client. Isn't that right?

15:07.640 --> 15:09.280
May I offer you a lift home?

15:11.200 --> 15:13.040
Yeah.
Thank you.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.600
My office, now.

15:24.880 --> 15:26.240
I'm sorry.

15:31.680 --> 15:33.120
You say you're sorry?

15:34.280 --> 15:35.720
What the hell happened?

15:36.720 --> 15:38.320
He just jumped out on me.

15:38.320 --> 15:40.800
I got in through the back door,
I made it to the living room,

15:40.800 --> 15:43.720
and there he was,
swinging at me like a madman.

15:43.720 --> 15:46.240
So you shot him?
I had no choice.

15:46.240 --> 15:49.280
You took a gun with you!
Just in case.

15:50.320 --> 15:52.240
My old service revolver.

15:52.240 --> 15:54.600
I didn't mean to do it,
it just happened.

15:56.040 --> 15:57.520
"It just happened"?

15:59.000 --> 16:01.240
What do you mean,
"it just happened"?

16:05.400 --> 16:07.320
Have you got a drink?
Hmm?

16:07.320 --> 16:08.600
Have you got a drink?

16:09.880 --> 16:11.160
Top drawer.

16:25.240 --> 16:27.800
I didn't know what to do.
Erm, so I...

16:29.400 --> 16:31.080
..pulled out some drawers.

16:33.360 --> 16:36.160
I took a few trinkets
to make it look like a robbery,

16:36.160 --> 16:37.320
just to...

16:38.560 --> 16:39.960
..you know, give us a get-out.

16:39.960 --> 16:41.160
Us?

16:49.920 --> 16:52.560
Gene Daltrey deserved
everything he got.

16:54.600 --> 16:56.480
What about Rita?
Did she see you?

16:56.480 --> 17:00.120
No, I didn't even make it as far
as her before he jumped out on me.

17:00.120 --> 17:02.640
She didn't know
I was coming last night.

17:02.640 --> 17:05.280
She would never have been able
to keep it from him.

17:06.960 --> 17:09.160
And you're sure she's just a client?

17:11.840 --> 17:13.480
That's not why I did it.

17:13.480 --> 17:15.720
Christ...
You saw what he did to her.

17:17.080 --> 17:19.680
I would have wanted to help her
regardless. And so would you.

17:19.680 --> 17:21.080
MOUTHS: And you...

17:21.080 --> 17:22.640
You did.

17:26.840 --> 17:28.120
We did.

17:29.400 --> 17:30.920
SIGHS

17:34.440 --> 17:35.960
Are you all right?

17:38.200 --> 17:40.040
It's going to feel different
without him.

17:46.760 --> 17:49.440
Madam, how are you?

17:49.440 --> 17:51.320
Would you get me a stiff drink,
please, Dorie?

17:52.560 --> 17:54.240
I don't think that's a good idea,
Rita.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.160
You've had a big shock
to the system.

17:56.160 --> 17:57.840
But I need something.

17:57.840 --> 17:59.520
Well, I can help with that.

18:01.240 --> 18:02.760
Thank you, Vicar.

18:09.960 --> 18:11.320
Dorie.

18:13.280 --> 18:14.920
Might I have a quick word?

18:16.960 --> 18:18.240
Can we get these tested?

18:18.240 --> 18:20.920
For what?
Sedatives.

18:20.920 --> 18:23.240
I took samples of drinks
from the Daltrey house.

18:23.240 --> 18:25.120
You what?
What if that's why Rita and Dorie

18:25.120 --> 18:27.360
were so tired last night,
because they were drugged?

18:27.360 --> 18:30.000
By who?
The doctor.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.320
We know he was giving them to Rita.
And he knew about the alarm.

18:34.600 --> 18:35.840
Larry...

18:39.360 --> 18:41.280
No, thanks, Will. That...

18:41.280 --> 18:43.240
Yeah, that's good work, yeah.

18:49.080 --> 18:51.680
TV: 'Hello there, proud builder.'
'How was the trip?'

18:51.680 --> 18:53.640
'Fine, except for the calluses
on my back

18:53.640 --> 18:55.640
'and the calluses on my hips.'

18:55.640 --> 18:57.640
TV DIALOGUE
CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY

19:00.680 --> 19:01.880
Will...

19:05.600 --> 19:08.320
Did you see Mrs Chapman's note
about the Bishop coming tomorrow?

19:10.200 --> 19:12.520
I guessed from the smell of polish.

19:15.280 --> 19:18.840
Er... I wanted to apologise.

19:19.800 --> 19:22.040
The Bishop asked me to report back
about the Vicarage,

19:22.040 --> 19:24.400
and I couldn't exactly lie,
could I? Clearly not.

19:25.760 --> 19:27.720
You may have the luxury
of bending the rules,

19:27.720 --> 19:30.000
but I've always been held
to a higher standard.

19:33.040 --> 19:34.600
Including by myself.

19:35.880 --> 19:38.320
So, for that, I can't apologise.

19:41.480 --> 19:44.200
Well, maybe my luck's run out now,
too.

19:44.200 --> 19:45.840
It's probably fair enough.

19:49.640 --> 19:54.160
"Paul and Silas were praying
and singing hymns to God...

19:55.280 --> 19:57.920
"..and the prisoners
were listening to them.

19:57.920 --> 20:01.480
"And suddenly,
there was a great earthquake,

20:01.480 --> 20:05.040
"so that the foundations
of the prison were shaken.

20:05.040 --> 20:07.120
"And immediately all the doors
opened..."

20:07.120 --> 20:08.240
DOOR OPENS

20:08.240 --> 20:10.920
"..and everyone's fetters
were unfastened." Finch...

20:14.800 --> 20:16.240
A word...

20:17.280 --> 20:18.560
..if you please.

20:21.720 --> 20:24.640
Bible group seems to be going well.

20:24.640 --> 20:27.560
It's wonderful. Inspiring.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.760
Well, it's not your concern
any more.

20:29.760 --> 20:30.960
Oh?

20:30.960 --> 20:33.160
You've found a new chaplain?

20:33.160 --> 20:35.920
No, but the prison board,
in their infinite wisdom,

20:35.920 --> 20:38.960
have decided to reduce
your sentence.

20:38.960 --> 20:43.120
In the light of your help
exposing the Reverend Mr Byatt.

20:44.160 --> 20:45.520
You must be delighted.

20:46.800 --> 20:48.040
I am.

20:52.400 --> 20:53.920
Morning.

20:55.160 --> 20:56.840
Is, er, Geordie in?

20:56.840 --> 20:58.240
Not yet.

20:58.240 --> 21:00.880
Larry, have you got those
test results back yet?

21:00.880 --> 21:03.840
Oh, the boss changed his mind.
He said not to bother with them.

21:05.360 --> 21:08.160
Do you think Geordie's
been himself recently?

21:08.160 --> 21:10.360
I mean, when was the last time
he was late for work

21:10.360 --> 21:12.040
or didn't follow up leads?

21:12.040 --> 21:15.200
Will, the other day, when
Mrs Daltrey's solicitor was here...

21:15.200 --> 21:17.200
Johnny.

21:17.200 --> 21:20.080
..Inspector Keating
showed him these.

21:25.480 --> 21:27.040
The Daltrey alarm codes.

21:40.280 --> 21:41.800
BOTTLES RATTLE

21:41.800 --> 21:43.960
Are we having a party?
No.

21:43.960 --> 21:45.640
Henry Jones is.

21:45.640 --> 21:47.920
Henry?
I didn't think he had it in him.

21:47.920 --> 21:49.480
Neither does he.

21:49.480 --> 21:52.720
He's had the nerve
to be telling tales about Will.

21:52.720 --> 21:54.480
And now the Bishop's
coming to see us!

21:57.080 --> 21:59.240
She Knelt Before Him?

21:59.240 --> 22:01.000
Obscenity!

22:02.240 --> 22:05.000
Let's see what the Bishop says when
he sees what Henry's been up to.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.400
BOTTLES RATTLE

22:16.920 --> 22:18.520
SNORING

22:18.520 --> 22:20.400
CLEARS HIS THROAT

22:22.400 --> 22:25.160
Excuse me...
GROANING

22:25.160 --> 22:27.160
Er, you're not supposed
to be sleeping here.

22:31.720 --> 22:34.240
Oh... Good morning, Inspector.

22:34.240 --> 22:36.120
I didn't expect to find you here.

22:37.680 --> 22:39.720
Yeah, that makes two of us, yes.

22:42.760 --> 22:44.200
Do you know where he is?

22:44.200 --> 22:47.040
He wasn't with you last night,
then, either?

22:47.040 --> 22:49.600
I wouldn't worry.
He's, er, probably just with Johnny.

22:49.600 --> 22:51.440
Well, that is
what I'm worried about.

22:51.440 --> 22:54.720
Why are you worried?
If I have to answer that,

22:54.720 --> 22:57.880
you're not as good a vicar
as I thought you were.

22:57.880 --> 23:00.040
You're the one who came here.
So, something is up.

23:00.040 --> 23:01.680
You tell me.

23:01.680 --> 23:05.280
I'm just concerned
he's making mistakes at work.

23:05.280 --> 23:07.600
Cos that's the most important thing.

23:07.600 --> 23:09.120
Ha!
What does that mean?

23:09.120 --> 23:11.440
You saw the state of him
at our anniversary.

23:11.440 --> 23:13.520
You didn't come round here then,
did you?

23:13.520 --> 23:15.160
I'm sorry, has something happened?

23:15.160 --> 23:17.600
SHE SIGHS
I shouldn't be telling you this.

23:17.600 --> 23:19.240
You're his friend.

23:19.240 --> 23:21.440
I don't feel much like it
at the moment.

23:22.440 --> 23:23.880
Cathy...

23:23.880 --> 23:25.400
"Just a lover's tiff."

23:25.400 --> 23:27.280
That's what my mother used to say.

23:28.440 --> 23:31.320
Oh, he didn't hit me.
He never has.

23:32.840 --> 23:34.080
But he wanted to.

23:47.880 --> 23:49.200
DOOR BURSTS OPEN

23:49.200 --> 23:51.080
You don't ever raise your hand
to Cathy!

23:51.080 --> 23:52.680
What?

23:52.680 --> 23:55.240
I never touched her!
You shouldn't have even come close!

23:56.200 --> 23:58.920
What, do you want to hit me now?
Well, go on, then!

24:00.040 --> 24:02.000
Fine, I deserve it.

24:03.240 --> 24:04.920
Get off me.

24:08.240 --> 24:09.720
I'm not your father.

24:10.720 --> 24:12.720
No, you're not.

24:12.720 --> 24:14.840
I expected better from you.

24:15.960 --> 24:18.320
Yeah, well, that's your fault,
not mine.

24:19.480 --> 24:21.720
I know you gave Johnny
the alarm timings.

24:24.240 --> 24:26.720
Did you know he was going
to kill Daltrey?

24:26.720 --> 24:29.040
Of course not!

24:29.040 --> 24:31.080
It was self-defence.

24:31.080 --> 24:33.280
But he's seeing Rita.

24:33.280 --> 24:35.080
Let go.

24:35.080 --> 24:38.480
It makes no difference.
You saw the state of her.

24:38.480 --> 24:40.880
You want to be angry with me?

24:40.880 --> 24:42.760
You should be pleased
Daltrey's dead.

24:42.760 --> 24:44.440
That is not our decision to make.

24:44.440 --> 24:45.760
Whose is it?!

24:45.760 --> 24:47.920
It's his?!
It's the law's!

24:49.880 --> 24:51.320
Like it was with Leonard?

24:53.040 --> 24:54.880
You said yourself...

24:54.880 --> 24:57.320
rules, laws, nonsense!

24:57.320 --> 24:58.720
No.

24:58.720 --> 25:00.320
No, the law is who you are.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.160
You have no idea who I am.

25:20.800 --> 25:24.080
I know I will never understand
what you and Johnny went through.

25:25.240 --> 25:26.640
But what is it you owe him?

25:28.120 --> 25:29.640
Geordie?

25:39.760 --> 25:41.240
What's this?

25:41.240 --> 25:42.720
It's a list.

25:47.840 --> 25:51.560
Of the men that died in our time
at the prison of war camp.

25:52.760 --> 25:55.760
It was the last man's job to tell
the families what had happened...

25:56.840 --> 25:58.280
..to their boys.

26:00.240 --> 26:01.880
I was the last man.

26:05.920 --> 26:08.440
By the end of the war,
they knew they were losing.

26:10.840 --> 26:14.320
The guards would take one of us out
every couple of days.

26:15.560 --> 26:18.880
It started with the sick,
those who couldn't work.

26:21.280 --> 26:22.600
And they shot him.

26:26.280 --> 26:28.200
To save food.

26:29.720 --> 26:31.280
Not that we got much.

26:32.840 --> 26:34.920
Keep the rest of us on our toes.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.800
But by the end we were...

26:40.120 --> 26:41.560
..all broken.

26:42.920 --> 26:44.800
So, there was no order, no...

26:45.880 --> 26:47.920
..rhyme nor reason.

26:49.880 --> 26:51.600
They just picked someone.

26:53.240 --> 26:55.480
Until there was only two of us left.

26:57.040 --> 26:58.560
You and Johnny.

27:03.440 --> 27:05.520
That last night...

27:05.520 --> 27:07.440
I said, "I hope they pick me."

27:10.200 --> 27:11.840
And he said the same.

27:15.840 --> 27:19.160
But when I rolled over to sleep that
night, do you know what I did?

27:21.400 --> 27:24.200
I prayed they'd pick Johnny
instead of me.

27:28.280 --> 27:32.360
Can you imagine...
praying for your friend to die?

27:32.360 --> 27:34.600
Geordie...
Then, in the morning, he was gone.

27:37.080 --> 27:38.920
HE SNIFFLES

27:40.560 --> 27:42.920
And then there was a shot.

27:42.920 --> 27:45.120
And then another.

27:46.640 --> 27:48.280
And another.

27:50.320 --> 27:52.960
The Yanks had armed up
the Burmese and...

27:53.960 --> 27:55.680
..and they liberated the camp.

27:56.680 --> 27:59.960
When we got home,
I lost him after demob.

28:01.240 --> 28:03.000
On purpose.

28:04.560 --> 28:07.200
And I never saw him again,
until he turned up here.

28:08.440 --> 28:10.040
But you both survived.

28:11.800 --> 28:15.160
But it doesn't matter.
I prayed for him to die.

28:17.200 --> 28:18.680
I begged for it.

28:21.360 --> 28:22.920
That's who I am!

28:24.840 --> 28:26.840
I know it.

28:28.720 --> 28:30.600
God knows it.
No.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.560
No, God heard your prayer
for what it was.

28:34.560 --> 28:37.240
HE SNIFFLES
Fear, desperation.

28:37.240 --> 28:40.920
You didn't pray for Johnny to die.
You prayed to live.

28:42.120 --> 28:44.440
And look what you've built.

28:44.440 --> 28:47.160
Cathy, the kids, your job.

28:48.440 --> 28:51.480
And you cannot throw that away,
not for anything.

28:58.400 --> 29:00.240
I'll come with you.

29:00.240 --> 29:02.160
And we can talk to him together.

29:02.160 --> 29:04.400
HE SNIFFS
No.

29:07.200 --> 29:08.840
Whatever happens...

29:13.720 --> 29:15.720
..it's between me and Johnny.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.360
SIGHS HEAVILY

29:34.880 --> 29:37.120
There he is!

29:37.120 --> 29:41.120
Daniel told me you didn't want
to be seen with him.

29:41.120 --> 29:43.560
Well...
Very wise.

29:43.560 --> 29:47.240
We don't want you going straight
back in, do we? No.

29:47.240 --> 29:50.680
He also told me that you felt
you were lacking purpose.

29:50.680 --> 29:53.800
Well, look no further.

29:53.800 --> 29:55.800
It's Sylvia.

29:57.080 --> 30:00.360
She needs you. Or rather,
Henry does, the new curate.

30:00.360 --> 30:01.640
SIGHS

30:01.640 --> 30:03.800
She's taken against him.
Whatever for?

30:05.200 --> 30:08.880
He's too tidy.
Too competent, too perfect.

30:08.880 --> 30:11.200
Hmm...
He's just not you.

30:12.480 --> 30:16.200
You have to talk to her, Leonard.
She won't listen to anyone else.

30:24.560 --> 30:26.520
There's, er, some chocolate for you.

30:26.520 --> 30:29.160
And dandelion and burdock.
Oh...

30:31.360 --> 30:33.000
Oh!

30:33.000 --> 30:36.120
Could we just get going?
My knees are killing me.

30:41.240 --> 30:42.920
ENGINE STARTS

30:44.440 --> 30:46.800
LARRY: 'Have you found the boss?'
Not yet.

30:51.520 --> 30:53.200
I got those drinks tested.

30:53.200 --> 30:55.800
'And you were right,
they were spiked.

30:55.800 --> 30:57.520
'Phenobarbitone.

30:57.520 --> 31:00.200
'Looks like the doctor was putting
the whole house to sleep.'

31:15.120 --> 31:16.560
Hey, mate.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.480
Are we in the clear?

31:28.800 --> 31:30.400
DOORBELL RINGS

31:30.400 --> 31:32.560
My lord...

31:32.560 --> 31:33.920
Leonard?!

31:35.240 --> 31:36.800
Uh-uh.

31:41.360 --> 31:44.640
Mrs C, I have heard
some shocking allegations

31:44.640 --> 31:46.520
of bullying during my absence.

31:46.520 --> 31:48.880
You should see what Henry's
done to your room.

32:00.840 --> 32:02.840
And this is all Henry?

32:07.560 --> 32:09.720
HE SIGHS

32:15.320 --> 32:17.600
I'd know this shade anywhere.

32:19.280 --> 32:22.720
He's a tell-tale.
He's going to lose Will his job.

32:22.720 --> 32:24.600
He doesn't even eat meat!

32:24.600 --> 32:26.840
Sidney was a drunk.
Will rides a motorbike.

32:26.840 --> 32:28.400
I've been to prison.

32:28.400 --> 32:30.840
You were very hard on us all.
And rightly so.

32:30.840 --> 32:32.640
But you were always fair.

32:32.640 --> 32:34.480
Well, mostly.

32:36.320 --> 32:38.440
We both need to accept...

32:38.440 --> 32:40.840
this isn't my room any more.

32:40.840 --> 32:44.560
But that doesn't mean
I won't always love you.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.480
Oh, I love you, too.

32:48.480 --> 32:50.680
I've missed you so much!

32:50.680 --> 32:53.200
HENRY: Hello? Mrs Chapman?

32:53.200 --> 32:55.400
You, tidy up. I'll stall him.

33:01.960 --> 33:04.440
Don't worry, I haven't escaped.

33:04.440 --> 33:06.520
The notorious Leonard Finch.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.880
Henry Jones.
DOG BARKS

33:09.880 --> 33:14.520
Oh, hello, boy!
Oh, I've missed you, too.

33:14.520 --> 33:17.760
How do you get him to sit like that?
Oh, it just takes time.

33:17.760 --> 33:19.640
And biscuits.

33:19.640 --> 33:21.360
A bit like Mrs C.

33:23.280 --> 33:24.680
How are you finding it?

33:24.680 --> 33:27.920
Well... The parish is lovely.

33:27.920 --> 33:30.600
And the congregation
seem very nice, but...

33:32.400 --> 33:34.960
..I don't think Mrs Chapman
likes me very much.

33:34.960 --> 33:37.200
Which is credit to you, I'm sure.

33:37.200 --> 33:40.440
Mrs C's a rite of passage.

33:40.440 --> 33:44.360
We have similar things in prison.
You'll come out stronger.

33:45.440 --> 33:49.400
And Will - I accidentally
got him into some trouble and...

33:49.400 --> 33:54.000
Will's more than capable
of getting himself into trouble.

33:54.000 --> 33:58.200
But only because he wants to be
out there saving souls, lives,

33:58.200 --> 34:00.760
helping the police.

34:02.160 --> 34:04.760
He's the kind of vicar
I'd have liked to have been.

34:06.680 --> 34:08.400
Maybe you will be, too.

34:15.040 --> 34:17.240
Single malt?
Hmm?

34:17.240 --> 34:18.800
I'm all right.

34:21.360 --> 34:23.200
I usually get a suite.

34:23.200 --> 34:25.960
But it was only supposed to be
a couple of nights,

34:25.960 --> 34:28.520
then I bumped into you and...

34:28.520 --> 34:30.360
Rita.

34:32.440 --> 34:33.880
Are you sure?

34:33.880 --> 34:36.360
Only the best.
I can't let you get away with it.

34:40.120 --> 34:42.200
I'll help you.

34:42.200 --> 34:44.680
We'll tell them the truth.

34:44.680 --> 34:47.240
That you were protecting Rita,
that it was self-defence.

34:48.520 --> 34:51.720
It'll be manslaughter, not murder.
Geordie, come on.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.720
Gene Daltrey was a bully.

34:56.720 --> 34:59.120
He had it coming.
I can't lie for you.

34:59.120 --> 35:02.320
After everything we went through
together in that hut...

35:03.480 --> 35:05.200
..and you can't let me go?

35:08.920 --> 35:10.160
SCOFFS

35:11.800 --> 35:14.480
You let me go back then all right,
didn't you?

35:26.520 --> 35:28.440
"When we get out."

35:31.640 --> 35:33.720
That's what you used to say.

35:33.720 --> 35:35.320
Do you remember?

35:36.640 --> 35:38.360
"When we get out of this...

35:39.600 --> 35:41.920
"..we're gonna go out every weekend.

35:41.920 --> 35:43.920
"Chicken dinners.

35:45.320 --> 35:46.920
"Dancing.

35:46.920 --> 35:48.160
"Drinking."

35:50.000 --> 35:51.640
You kept me going.

35:54.040 --> 35:55.720
And then you were gone.

35:57.440 --> 35:59.600
I couldn't do it.
What?

36:02.200 --> 36:04.120
I couldn't face you.

36:05.880 --> 36:07.760
Because I'd prayed for you to die.

36:14.920 --> 36:16.600
I'm sorry.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.600
I'd have gone for you.

36:34.120 --> 36:35.720
I really would.

36:40.560 --> 36:42.040
Is Dr Harvey here?

36:43.760 --> 36:45.360
Doctor!
Dorie...

36:45.360 --> 36:46.720
DOOR SHUTS

36:46.720 --> 36:50.960
Do you see much of him and Johnny
together, Rita's solicitor?

36:50.960 --> 36:52.640
We think they drugged you,

36:52.640 --> 36:56.040
that's why you and Rita were
so tired the night of the murder.

36:57.440 --> 36:59.520
Excuse me?

36:59.520 --> 37:04.080
I prescribed those pills solely
and legitimately for Mrs Daltrey.

37:04.080 --> 37:05.520
She's...

37:05.520 --> 37:08.680
She's been very agitated,
hurting herself.

37:08.680 --> 37:11.320
Mr Gene never touched her.

37:11.320 --> 37:13.240
He loved her.

37:13.240 --> 37:14.920
Protected her

37:14.920 --> 37:17.560
Maybe too much sometimes.

37:17.560 --> 37:21.280
He didn't want anyone to know
how bad it was.

37:21.280 --> 37:23.520
Those drinks you brought down
the other day,

37:23.520 --> 37:25.040
they weren't yours and Rita's?

37:25.040 --> 37:27.320
They were mine and Mr Gene's.

37:28.400 --> 37:31.560
So Rita wasn't the one sedated.

37:31.560 --> 37:33.120
Where is she?

37:33.120 --> 37:35.000
KNOCKING

37:35.000 --> 37:37.400
Hello, my love!

37:39.840 --> 37:41.560
It's all right, Geordie understands.

37:41.560 --> 37:44.240
He knows that I did it
to protect you.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.360
Inspector.

37:48.360 --> 37:51.960
I wanted to thank you
for intervening when you did.

37:51.960 --> 37:54.480
And for taking a chance to help us.

37:54.480 --> 37:57.840
I don't know what I would've done
without you both.

37:59.120 --> 38:01.400
Johnny tells me
you have a beautiful family.

38:01.400 --> 38:03.800
Yeah, we...
We just want what you've got.

38:15.960 --> 38:18.440
Where's Geordie?
He's not here.

38:18.440 --> 38:21.160
Hey, you...!
Are you all right?

38:21.160 --> 38:22.800
I know the truth.

38:22.800 --> 38:24.800
Oh, give it up, Will.
He's not sending us down.

38:24.800 --> 38:26.040
You don't owe him anything.

38:26.040 --> 38:28.000
What, and he does you?
No, he owes himself.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.400
Who even is he to you?

38:29.400 --> 38:31.840
You want him to put in
a good word for you, is that it?

38:31.840 --> 38:33.840
Ask him upstairs to take back your
prayers.

38:33.840 --> 38:35.520
We have been through this.
So have we!

38:35.520 --> 38:37.480
When people are trapped
in awful situations,

38:37.480 --> 38:39.960
they do the things they have to.
What does he know?

38:39.960 --> 38:42.520
That's what you'd have us believe,
isn't it, Rita?

38:43.680 --> 38:46.520
Geordie did what he had to.
And then he came back home

38:46.520 --> 38:48.600
and he turned that awfulness
into something good.

38:48.600 --> 38:50.800
A job, a family, a life.

38:50.800 --> 38:53.280
And it takes strength and courage.

38:53.280 --> 38:55.920
More than stealing money
or killing a man ever could.

38:55.920 --> 38:58.680
What do you mean?
Gene never touched you, did he?

38:58.680 --> 39:01.040
But you drugged and killed him.

39:04.960 --> 39:06.560
GUNSHOT

39:06.560 --> 39:09.120
Let me guess,
she had you write Gene's will.

39:09.120 --> 39:10.880
She saw the pain you were in

39:10.880 --> 39:13.240
and told you the story
you wanted to hear.

39:13.240 --> 39:15.480
She is using you, Johnny.

39:15.480 --> 39:17.360
Just like you're using Geordie.

39:21.160 --> 39:23.080
I love you.

39:24.560 --> 39:27.280
They're just words from a song.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.600
You don't get to stand on stage
as long as I have

39:31.600 --> 39:33.960
without getting to know
what men want.

39:35.920 --> 39:40.200
I made Gene that money
and he was never gonna let me go!

39:41.440 --> 39:42.720
Like you say,

39:42.720 --> 39:45.120
people do what they have
to when they're trapped.

39:45.120 --> 39:46.280
Rita...!

39:47.800 --> 39:49.760
Just let them go, Will.

39:49.760 --> 39:51.360
No.

39:52.720 --> 39:54.520
Will...

39:54.520 --> 39:56.480
Fine!
GUNSHOT

39:58.640 --> 40:00.160
SHE STRAINS
Give me that!

40:01.320 --> 40:05.240
Rita Daltrey, I'm arresting you
for the murder of Gene Daltrey.

40:05.240 --> 40:06.920
I'm sorry.

40:09.400 --> 40:11.280
I knew you never had it in you!

40:15.000 --> 40:19.120
Johnny Richards, I'm arresting you
for conspiracy to cover up a murder.

40:24.080 --> 40:25.920
Not too tight, eh?

40:30.800 --> 40:34.200
CLOCK TICKS

40:39.400 --> 40:41.040
DOG WHINES

40:41.040 --> 40:42.960
Another sandwich, my lord?

40:42.960 --> 40:44.880
Where did you say he went?

40:44.880 --> 40:48.480
Urgent police business, I believe.
FRONT DOOR OPENS

40:50.760 --> 40:53.480
I'm so sorry, Bishop.
It's too late for that.

40:53.480 --> 40:55.720
This is exactly the kind of
dereliction

40:55.720 --> 40:57.000
I've come to expect from you.

40:57.000 --> 40:59.880
Disrespect, disobedience,
without even the common courtesy

40:59.880 --> 41:02.280
to arrive on time
to defend your job.

41:02.280 --> 41:04.120
Bishop, if I may be so bold.

41:04.120 --> 41:07.000
I think it's important
we don't mistake my naivety

41:07.000 --> 41:08.520
for Mr Davenport's negligence.

41:10.120 --> 41:12.160
What I mistook for distraction
from work

41:12.160 --> 41:14.280
was actually
the fight against injustice.

41:14.280 --> 41:17.840
I misread the rescue of
a fallen women for wanton lust.

41:17.840 --> 41:20.520
I like to see myself
as a practical clergyman

41:20.520 --> 41:22.840
and I'm very much looking forward
to learning from Will

41:22.840 --> 41:24.560
in the months and years to come.

41:27.240 --> 41:28.360
Well, actually, I think

41:28.360 --> 41:31.000
there's a lot I could learn from
Henry, too...

41:31.000 --> 41:35.400
about temperance, decorum and,
of course, punctuality.

41:37.040 --> 41:39.320
Lardy cake?

41:39.320 --> 41:40.480
BARKS

42:05.240 --> 42:06.960
Are you all right?

42:12.720 --> 42:14.480
What's that?

42:20.320 --> 42:22.280
No, Cathy.

42:24.320 --> 42:26.080
Listen...

42:27.880 --> 42:31.400
I know things haven't been
right recently.

42:32.680 --> 42:34.320
I want some time apart.

42:37.600 --> 42:39.440
How long?

42:41.640 --> 42:43.480
We'll see.

42:48.480 --> 42:49.960
Cathy...

42:52.640 --> 42:54.360
Please...

42:55.760 --> 42:57.760
I'll be better.

42:59.200 --> 43:02.400
I'll tell the kids
it's just for now.

43:22.760 --> 43:24.640
Dear, God...

43:27.080 --> 43:28.960
..it's been a while.

43:31.840 --> 43:34.280
I don't really remember
how this works.

43:37.520 --> 43:39.640
But hopefully you still forgive.

43:47.680 --> 43:50.160
I'm hoping you can make me
a better man.

43:52.480 --> 43:54.240
To my family.

43:58.680 --> 44:00.560
To my friends.

44:02.520 --> 44:04.080
And to you.

44:05.480 --> 44:07.240
Amen.

44:08.680 --> 44:10.320
Mind if I join you?

44:13.720 --> 44:15.320
He's your boss.

44:21.320 --> 44:24.280
I've got Will Davenport on line two,
sir.

44:28.640 --> 44:30.880
He says he'll meet us at the pub.

44:30.880 --> 44:32.560
BOTH CHUCKLE

44:33.640 --> 44:35.840
Are you all right?

44:35.840 --> 44:37.480
No.

44:39.600 --> 44:41.440
But at least I know it now.

44:43.240 --> 44:44.640
Will.

44:46.000 --> 44:49.520
I do not think any less of you
for not serving.

44:49.520 --> 44:52.240
In fact, I'm glad you didn't.

44:54.920 --> 44:58.240
Because you can see the world
as it ought to be.

44:59.960 --> 45:01.720
The only reason I didn't have to...

45:03.080 --> 45:05.560
..is because of men
like you and Johnny.

45:15.000 --> 45:16.920
I'm gonna get her back, you know.

45:16.920 --> 45:19.600
Cathy.
I know.

45:19.600 --> 45:21.160
And I'll help.

45:22.200 --> 45:24.120
What, with your track record?

45:25.160 --> 45:27.200
I'll take my own chances.

45:32.920 --> 45:35.240
