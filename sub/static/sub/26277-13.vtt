WEBVTT

00:00.100 --> 00:01.368
Previously on "Manifest"...

00:01.368 --> 00:04.605
No matter what I do, I'm the bad
guy, and I'm tired of it.

00:04.605 --> 00:06.974
So we're not doing this.

00:06.974 --> 00:09.343
And I love him.
I just hope it'll be enough.

00:09.343 --> 00:11.345
Saanvi: Listen, I discovered
something in Cal's blood.

00:11.345 --> 00:13.714
It's a marker, and it wasn't
there before the plane,

00:13.714 --> 00:15.215
and it turns out
that I have it, too.

00:15.215 --> 00:16.984
Did you get a calling, buddy,
that told you to come here?

00:16.984 --> 00:18.218
-He's coming.
-Cal.

00:18.218 --> 00:19.253
He's almost here.

00:21.455 --> 00:23.457
I was hiking.
There was a blizzard.

00:23.457 --> 00:24.558
I had a vision
of you.

00:24.558 --> 00:26.126
I heard you.
I-I saw you.

00:26.126 --> 00:27.527
I fell in
some sort of cave.

00:27.527 --> 00:29.296
I was burning
literally everything I had

00:29.296 --> 00:30.631
trying to stay warm.

00:30.631 --> 00:32.766
It was like you were giving me
your strength,

00:32.766 --> 00:33.967
willing me to live.

00:33.967 --> 00:35.536
How is it possible
you're here?

00:35.536 --> 00:36.837
What year
did you leave?

00:36.837 --> 00:38.572
2017.

00:39.406 --> 00:41.008
Zeke,
it's 2018.

00:48.015 --> 00:50.651
♪ I woke up this morning ♪

00:50.651 --> 00:53.086
♪ Didn't recognize the man... ♪

00:53.086 --> 00:54.488
That'll be it
for you today?

00:54.488 --> 00:56.089
Unless you got pork rinds
in the back.

00:56.089 --> 01:00.093
Yeah, we get more
on Tuesday, maybe.

01:00.093 --> 01:03.530
Then I'll be back
on Tuesday, maybe.

01:03.530 --> 01:05.966
You look familiar.
You been in before?

01:05.966 --> 01:08.902
Something like that.
You a climber?

01:08.902 --> 01:09.903
If you're gonna do
Gunnar's Hill,

01:09.903 --> 01:11.338
we got some great
new gloves you sh--

01:11.338 --> 01:14.408
Nope.
Just a hike.

01:14.408 --> 01:17.244
Crazy. Still no trace
after, what, four years?

01:17.244 --> 01:18.745
Oh, that plane?
It ain't missing.

01:18.745 --> 01:19.746
Oh, yeah?

01:19.746 --> 01:20.948
The Russians took it.

01:20.948 --> 01:23.083
Plucked it right out
of the sky.

01:23.083 --> 01:24.651
Makes sense.

01:29.623 --> 01:31.258
Okay, you have
a great day.

01:31.258 --> 01:34.361
You bet.
See you soon.

01:37.998 --> 01:41.168
Michaela:
The sleep did you good.
Your color looks better.

01:43.370 --> 01:45.172
You want
some hot chocolate?

01:47.140 --> 01:48.375
Zeke.

01:48.375 --> 01:50.177
Am I dead?

01:50.177 --> 01:51.945
No, but...

01:51.945 --> 01:53.914
that would be easier
to explain.

01:53.914 --> 01:57.818
A person can't freeze to death
in a cave

01:57.818 --> 02:00.620
and then, a year later,
walk out alive.

02:00.620 --> 02:02.356
Not on planet Earth.

02:02.356 --> 02:04.324
This is Earth, right?

02:04.324 --> 02:06.493
Yes, it is.

02:06.493 --> 02:08.195
And you did.

02:08.195 --> 02:10.297
How?

02:10.297 --> 02:13.300
We're still trying
to figure that out.

02:13.300 --> 02:15.068
Look, why don't you
walk me through

02:15.068 --> 02:16.336
everything
that you remember?

02:16.336 --> 02:17.804
You said that you
were hiking, right?

02:17.804 --> 02:20.674
And then this just
monster blizzard hit,
came out of nowhere.

02:20.674 --> 02:22.142
So then you took shelter
in the cave?

02:22.142 --> 02:24.077
I was packed in.
I mean, I didn't have the tools

02:24.077 --> 02:26.513
or the strength to break through
the snow and ice.

02:26.513 --> 02:28.081
I tried.

02:28.081 --> 02:30.250
That's where you got the cuts,
from trying to dig yourself out?

02:30.250 --> 02:32.519
Mm. Didn't work.

02:32.519 --> 02:34.588
Can I change those?

02:35.622 --> 02:37.090
So, then you remember
two weeks passing?

02:37.090 --> 02:39.693
Thought that was it for me.

02:39.693 --> 02:41.528
How'd you get out of the cave?

02:41.528 --> 02:43.697
Earthquake or avalanche
or something.

02:43.697 --> 02:45.699
Whole mountain shook,
and the ice broke away

02:45.699 --> 02:47.100
enough for me
to crawl out

02:47.100 --> 02:50.203
and make my way
to the first place I found.

02:50.203 --> 02:54.107
And to the dead girl I kept
telling myself to find.

02:54.107 --> 02:56.710
Except I wasn't dead.
And I heard you.

02:56.710 --> 02:58.545
And my list
of questions grows.

02:58.545 --> 03:01.415
Ben:
Well, we can talk about all that
on the ride back to the city.

03:01.415 --> 03:04.518
Grace and Cal are loaded in.
Let's hit it.

03:04.518 --> 03:07.087
I-I think I'm actually just
gonna stay up here for a while.

03:07.087 --> 03:09.256
This place
has great cocoa.

03:11.124 --> 03:13.060
We're taking Cal
straight to the hospital.

03:13.060 --> 03:15.662
We know someone there that can
have a look at you as well.

03:15.662 --> 03:17.064
I'm fine, really.

03:17.064 --> 03:19.132
I just need some time
to process everything

03:19.132 --> 03:20.901
before I go back
to civilization.

03:20.901 --> 03:23.437
Zeke, you need to come. We don't
know if that's infected --

03:23.437 --> 03:25.205
Sorry. I'm not going.

03:25.205 --> 03:27.174
Not yet.

03:27.174 --> 03:29.309
I'll stay with him.

03:29.309 --> 03:31.411
What?

03:34.247 --> 03:36.383
Excuse us.

03:41.154 --> 03:42.456
What are you doing?

03:42.456 --> 03:44.858
This guy's got to come with us
so Saanvi can check him out.

03:44.858 --> 03:47.394
He could hold the key to
everything that happened to us.

03:47.394 --> 03:49.996
828 defied the known laws
of physics.

03:49.996 --> 03:52.833
We've got to figure out how the
hell a cave did the same thing.

03:52.833 --> 03:55.635
There has to be a connection.
-Yeah, exactly.

03:55.635 --> 03:57.604
And since he's clearly
not coming,

03:57.604 --> 03:59.473
I'll stay here and figure out
as much as we can.

03:59.473 --> 04:01.341
All right.
I-I-It -- Just...

04:01.341 --> 04:04.244
find out as many details as you
can about what happened to him.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.246
Look for specific times,
locations --

04:06.246 --> 04:08.181
Oh, you mean like
a detective?

04:08.181 --> 04:11.284
Ben, I got this.
Go take care of your family.

04:13.086 --> 04:15.088
What?
Why are you hesitating?

04:16.556 --> 04:18.492
What's the first thing
you wanted to do

04:18.492 --> 04:20.927
when the plane landed
and we found out?

04:20.927 --> 04:23.797
Contact our family
and Jared.

04:23.797 --> 04:25.565
Exactly.

04:25.565 --> 04:28.735
We have been in a cabin
for eight hours with Zeke.

04:28.735 --> 04:32.239
He hasn't even asked
to use the phone?

04:32.239 --> 04:34.441
We don't know anything
about this guy.

04:34.441 --> 04:37.577
He could be part of some
elaborate plan by the Major.

04:37.577 --> 04:40.213
Cal and I had a calling
about him.

04:40.213 --> 04:42.983
Ben, I think
we can trust him.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.221
All right.

04:48.221 --> 04:49.623
I'll call Jared,
see if he can come up --

04:49.623 --> 04:51.191
No. No...

04:52.259 --> 04:54.561
I don't think
we should involve him.

04:54.561 --> 04:56.329
It's complicated.
I just --

04:56.329 --> 04:58.765
I don't want to be around him
right now.

04:58.765 --> 05:00.567
Okay.

05:00.567 --> 05:01.835
You sure
you're all right?

05:01.835 --> 05:04.104
Yeah.
Go. I got this.

05:06.673 --> 05:09.309
Be safe.

05:18.251 --> 05:21.354
He's gonna be fine.
Slight cold symptoms.

05:21.354 --> 05:23.156
Nothing a good night's sleep
won't knock out.

05:23.156 --> 05:25.492
Thank you for coming in
on your day off.

05:25.492 --> 05:26.593
It's no problem.

05:26.593 --> 05:28.528
I wanted to check on
some patients anyway.

05:28.528 --> 05:30.463
Don't you ever
take a vacation?

05:30.463 --> 05:32.499
Well,
I went to Jamaica.

05:32.499 --> 05:33.567
Right.

05:33.567 --> 05:35.302
I guess that kind of
went sideways.

05:35.302 --> 05:36.636
Actually,
it went sideways

05:36.636 --> 05:38.905
even before the plane
disappeared.

05:38.905 --> 05:40.941
The person I was
supposed to go with...

05:40.941 --> 05:42.809
Just didn't work out.

05:42.809 --> 05:44.311
Right. 8B.

05:44.311 --> 05:46.546
The seat beside you was empty.
I can't believe I never --

05:46.546 --> 05:49.249
Yeah. Okay, um, Cal,
I think you're ready to go.

05:49.249 --> 05:51.518
Although I think Bernadette
just refilled

05:51.518 --> 05:54.087
her famous candy jar
at the nurses' station.

05:54.087 --> 05:57.257
-Come straight back.
-One. Only one.

05:59.292 --> 06:03.096
I just -- I can't believe
it happened again.

06:03.096 --> 06:05.198
What's his name?
-Zeke.

06:05.198 --> 06:06.633
Okay. I need to run
the tests on him

06:06.633 --> 06:08.435
to see if he has the same
blood marker that we do.

06:08.435 --> 06:10.070
I was hoping
you'd say that

06:10.070 --> 06:13.473
because I don't normally carry
things like this around with me.

06:13.473 --> 06:16.476
I hope
it's enough to test.

06:17.277 --> 06:19.012
Just please be careful.

06:19.012 --> 06:20.814
We have no idea if
the Major's watching us.

06:20.814 --> 06:24.117
If she finds out how Cal led us
to the cabin and Zeke...

06:24.117 --> 06:25.452
S-She can never know that.

06:25.452 --> 06:27.687
-No one can.
-Know what?

06:28.989 --> 06:30.891
Uh, nothing.

06:30.891 --> 06:32.525
Do you
want to get going?

06:32.525 --> 06:34.394
Yeah.

06:44.437 --> 06:46.740
Thank Danny
for the truck.

06:46.740 --> 06:50.010
If I see him, I will.

06:50.010 --> 06:51.778
Aren't you coming home
with us?

06:51.778 --> 06:55.348
I'm sure Mom would be okay
with that. Right, Mom?

06:56.916 --> 06:59.986
Yeah, I could hang out
for a while.

06:59.986 --> 07:01.821
That works
with your plans, right?

07:01.821 --> 07:03.256
Yes, of course.

07:07.227 --> 07:09.462
What does that mean?

07:12.065 --> 07:15.402
Just that there are some very
ignorant people in the world.

07:27.847 --> 07:30.216
So, if years went by

07:30.216 --> 07:32.052
and we didn't feel it,

07:32.052 --> 07:34.087
where were we?

07:34.087 --> 07:36.589
In some kind of
suspended animation?

07:37.757 --> 07:40.093
Uh, we are still waiting
for the official handbook

07:40.093 --> 07:41.461
to come out on that.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.729
But there are theories,
right?

07:42.729 --> 07:44.631
About the plane?
Oh, yeah. Tons.

07:44.631 --> 07:47.367
Um, aliens, wormholes,

07:47.367 --> 07:50.870
cryogenic freezing,
mass hypnosis...

07:50.870 --> 07:52.539
Honestly,
no one knows.

07:52.539 --> 07:53.707
Hm.

07:53.707 --> 07:55.575
And you just stepped
right back into a life

07:55.575 --> 07:57.410
that had moved forward
half a decade?

07:57.410 --> 07:59.079
Slammed back in,
maybe.

07:59.079 --> 08:03.683
I came back to a world that had
completely moved on without me.

08:03.683 --> 08:06.453
But I had my family
to ground me.

08:09.522 --> 08:11.524
What about you?
Do you have anyone?

08:12.859 --> 08:15.228
Nope. No family.

08:15.228 --> 08:17.530
Tale as old as time.

08:17.530 --> 08:19.999
Someone then?
Friends, co-workers?

08:20.467 --> 08:22.035
And what? I just...

08:22.035 --> 08:24.304
call them out of the blue
and say,

08:24.304 --> 08:26.272
"Hey, remember me?
I went on a hike,

08:26.272 --> 08:28.041
but then a dead lady
from a picture

08:28.041 --> 08:30.310
told me I skipped ahead
a year.

08:30.310 --> 08:32.078
You want to go
to Olive Garden?"

08:32.078 --> 08:33.413
Zeke, look.

08:33.413 --> 08:34.981
I know that
it's a lot to process,

08:34.981 --> 08:36.883
but you have to trust me --
-Look, you're amazing,

08:36.883 --> 08:38.551
and I appreciate everything
you've done for me.

08:38.551 --> 08:40.420
But right now,
I have two options.

08:40.420 --> 08:42.288
Either you're insane
or I am,

08:42.288 --> 08:44.324
and right now,
I prefer the former.

08:44.324 --> 08:46.693
I know that
this sounds crazy,

08:46.693 --> 08:48.862
but something happened to you
in that cave,

08:48.862 --> 08:51.231
and something happened to me
on that plane.

08:51.231 --> 08:53.266
Zeke, somehow,
we're the same.

08:53.266 --> 08:55.101
Zeke:
Go back.

08:55.101 --> 08:56.536
Go back.

08:58.638 --> 09:01.241
Did you just hear
"Go back"?

09:01.241 --> 09:03.443
What the hell
was that?

09:04.711 --> 09:06.413
That was a calling.

09:11.384 --> 09:13.353
You and I, we were both --

09:13.353 --> 09:14.621
Yeah, under the night sky,
filled with stars. I know.

09:14.621 --> 09:16.656
And you -- you heard
my voice say, "Go back"?

09:16.656 --> 09:19.492
Yeah, I heard your voice, which
isn't usually how these work.

09:19.492 --> 09:21.194
Usually?
There's a usually?

09:21.194 --> 09:22.595
Ever since the plane
came back,

09:22.595 --> 09:25.598
a lot of us have been
experiencing...callings.

09:25.598 --> 09:27.901
Callings?
You mean voices in your head?

09:27.901 --> 09:30.370
Voices, visions.
They lead us to uncover things.

09:30.370 --> 09:32.272
That's how Cal knew
where to find you

09:32.272 --> 09:33.907
and how I heard you say,
"Find her."

09:33.907 --> 09:35.275
Right,
there is that.

09:35.275 --> 09:36.910
But we both heard it,
which I think means

09:36.910 --> 09:38.845
we're supposed to figure
this out together.

09:38.845 --> 09:40.413
"Go back"? W-What does
that even mean?

09:40.413 --> 09:41.681
Go back where?
-I don't know.

09:41.681 --> 09:44.951
Maybe you're supposed to
go back to the cave.

09:44.951 --> 09:46.586
How far away is it?

09:46.586 --> 09:49.222
Probably about
an hour hike.

09:49.222 --> 09:51.524
But I almost died
in that cave.

09:51.524 --> 09:53.159
I think I m-might
just sit this one out.

09:53.159 --> 09:56.062
No, we both heard it, which
means we're both gonna go.

09:57.697 --> 09:59.866
Can I rest for a bit first,
tough guy?

10:01.234 --> 10:03.303
Yeah, of course.

10:03.303 --> 10:06.639
And we're gonna
need some supplies.

10:08.041 --> 10:09.876
Okay, I'll go.

10:09.876 --> 10:10.877
Like what?

10:10.877 --> 10:12.846
Water, compass,

10:12.846 --> 10:15.381
um, flashlights...

10:15.381 --> 10:16.850
pork rinds...

10:16.850 --> 10:18.251
I'm sorry. What?

10:18.251 --> 10:20.053
Pork rinds.

10:20.053 --> 10:21.754
Delicious salty snack.

10:21.754 --> 10:23.189
They still make those,
right?

10:23.189 --> 10:24.491
Yeah, unfortunately.

10:24.491 --> 10:26.392
Um, your first craving
back is...

10:26.392 --> 10:28.561
I'm a man
of many mysteries.

10:28.561 --> 10:32.465
Yeah, I don't think I can
handle any more mystery.

10:39.839 --> 10:41.641
Olive?

10:41.641 --> 10:42.709
Cal!

10:42.709 --> 10:46.146
Oh, my gosh. I'm so glad
that you're back.

10:46.913 --> 10:50.383
Ow.
But I'm mad at you
for scaring me like that.

10:50.383 --> 10:54.587
Come here.
Oh, God, you really scared me.

10:55.588 --> 10:58.324
I love you very much.
You know that?

10:58.324 --> 10:59.659
You sure you're okay?
I know.

10:59.659 --> 11:02.929
Well, we made
Rice Krispie treats.

11:02.929 --> 11:05.064
Yep.
Don't eat 'em all.

11:05.064 --> 11:07.267
Well,
we had to do something.

11:07.267 --> 11:09.269
Ben.

11:13.006 --> 11:16.242
Are we gonna tell Olive
about Cal's callings?

11:16.242 --> 11:17.644
We can't take
that risk.

11:17.644 --> 11:19.712
Right, but keeping
Olive isolated

11:19.712 --> 11:22.348
from the rest of the family,
that has its own dangers.

11:22.348 --> 11:24.517
I know, Grace.
But people died.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.419
Until we know for sure
it's unrelated, I --

11:26.419 --> 11:30.523
Wait. The people who died...
that happened right away?

11:30.523 --> 11:33.259
Within a few days of learning
about the callings.

11:34.193 --> 11:36.496
Okay, so...

11:36.496 --> 11:40.166
let's just make sure this theory
is definitively disproven.

11:40.166 --> 11:42.268
All I have to do is...

11:42.268 --> 11:44.304
live, right?

11:47.340 --> 11:49.776
So now what?

11:49.776 --> 11:51.945
I wish I knew.

11:54.214 --> 11:57.050
♪ You shine like a star ♪

11:57.050 --> 11:58.918
♪ You know who you are ♪

11:58.918 --> 12:00.386
Do you have
any pork rinds?

12:00.386 --> 12:03.256
Yeah. Check over there.
There might be one or two left.

12:03.256 --> 12:06.960
♪ She's hot, hot like the sun ♪

12:06.960 --> 12:09.195
♪ The loneliest one ♪

12:09.195 --> 12:12.098
♪ Still everything beautiful ♪

12:19.305 --> 12:21.274
Can I take this?

12:21.274 --> 12:22.809
Sure.

12:22.809 --> 12:25.445
Real tragedy.

12:25.445 --> 12:27.046
Body's never been found.

12:27.046 --> 12:29.449
'Course, I got a pretty good
idea what really happened.

12:31.618 --> 12:32.852
What?

12:32.852 --> 12:34.287
He offed himself.

12:36.522 --> 12:38.024
Yeah?
Why do you think that?

12:38.024 --> 12:42.695
His sister, Chloe, died on
this same mountain in 2006.

12:42.695 --> 12:45.031
Cursed family, I guess.

12:52.538 --> 12:54.440
Zeke?

13:06.853 --> 13:08.454
How'd you get
that many letters?

13:08.454 --> 13:10.390
Wait a second.
-This -- Excuse me.

13:10.390 --> 13:12.625
Mind your own letters.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.127
Peel.

13:14.127 --> 13:15.428
No. What?

13:16.663 --> 13:18.665
You guys keep playing.
I'll get the door.

13:22.301 --> 13:23.770
-Jared.
-Hey, Grace.

13:23.770 --> 13:24.737
Sorry to just show up.

13:24.737 --> 13:26.406
No, not at all.
Come on in.

13:26.406 --> 13:27.907
How's Cal?

13:27.907 --> 13:29.809
See for yourself.

13:29.809 --> 13:31.110
Jared.

13:31.110 --> 13:32.311
Hey.

13:32.311 --> 13:34.013
Hi, guys.

13:34.013 --> 13:36.616
'Sup, little man?
How's it going?

13:36.616 --> 13:39.519
Ugh. I have a "Q."

13:39.519 --> 13:42.221
Other than that,
he's great.

13:42.221 --> 13:43.523
Hey.

13:43.523 --> 13:45.458
Thanks for what you did
yesterday.

13:45.458 --> 13:46.826
Of course.

13:48.394 --> 13:49.729
Have you guys
heard from Mick?

13:49.729 --> 13:52.165
I'm starting to get
worried, actually.

13:52.165 --> 13:53.499
Uh, she's fine.

13:53.499 --> 13:55.435
The cell service up there
is pretty spotty.

13:55.435 --> 13:57.603
Why's she still up there?

13:57.603 --> 14:01.774
Said she wanted some
alone time, decompress.

14:01.774 --> 14:03.076
Really?

14:04.644 --> 14:06.112
Man: Freaks!

14:06.112 --> 14:08.047
Everyone okay?

14:08.047 --> 14:09.515
Stay inside!

14:09.515 --> 14:10.917
Just...don't get up.

14:12.518 --> 14:14.787
Hey!

14:14.787 --> 14:17.056
Hey, stay here.
I'm going after them.

14:40.279 --> 14:42.482
Hey!

14:48.788 --> 14:52.225
They were
out of pork rinds.

14:53.926 --> 14:55.228
Figures.

14:56.295 --> 14:58.030
Look.
I get it, okay?

14:58.030 --> 14:59.665
The first time that
I had a calling,

14:59.665 --> 15:01.267
I wanted to pretend that
it wasn't happening, too.

15:01.267 --> 15:02.935
But you can't just
run away from this.

15:02.935 --> 15:05.638
I'm not.
I just sort of walking away.

15:05.638 --> 15:07.173
To go where?
Your family?

15:07.173 --> 15:08.674
I told you.
I don't have any family.

15:08.674 --> 15:10.343
What about Chloe?

15:15.748 --> 15:19.185
My sister?
Yeah, she was family.

15:19.185 --> 15:21.587
She was the best version
of family.

15:21.587 --> 15:23.422
And she's dead.

15:25.358 --> 15:26.826
How did you...

15:26.826 --> 15:29.295
This was still hanging
at the bait shop.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.765
Guy there really
likes to talk.

15:32.765 --> 15:34.767
Oh, I remember.

15:34.767 --> 15:37.170
Look, Zeke,
I'm sorry, okay?

15:37.170 --> 15:39.238
I know how hard that
kind of loss can be.

15:39.238 --> 15:41.240
No, you don't know.

15:41.240 --> 15:42.575
After Chloe died,

15:42.575 --> 15:44.644
my family was ripped apart
from the inside out,

15:44.644 --> 15:46.913
and this whole area is
a constant reminder of that.

15:46.913 --> 15:48.714
So what I'd really like to do
right now

15:48.714 --> 15:50.883
is to leave this place
and to go find the nearest bar.

15:50.883 --> 15:52.218
Look, I'm sorry, Zeke.

15:52.218 --> 15:53.719
I need you to show me
where the cave is.

15:53.719 --> 15:55.388
I can't explain why
exactly,

15:55.388 --> 15:57.957
but I know that we need
to do it together.

15:57.957 --> 16:01.527
I'm trusting you.
I'm asking for you to trust me.

16:05.731 --> 16:07.867
Fine.
I'll take you to the cave.

16:08.935 --> 16:12.071
But then I need to get the hell
off this mountain, okay?

16:12.071 --> 16:14.073
Okay.

16:14.073 --> 16:17.376
Oh, and, uh,
by the way, I lied.

16:29.288 --> 16:31.824
And that's all it recorded

16:31.824 --> 16:33.059
before they ruined
the camera.

16:33.059 --> 16:34.794
We got the brick
and the paint can.

16:34.794 --> 16:36.329
Hopefully we can get
the prints off them.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.164
Hope so, 'cause we can't I.D.
them from the footage.

16:38.164 --> 16:39.532
They knew what
they were doing.

16:39.532 --> 16:41.067
Yeah, they had
a getaway plan.

16:41.067 --> 16:42.969
I mean, I lost them
pretty quickly.

16:42.969 --> 16:45.037
Kids are coping all right,
I think.

16:45.037 --> 16:46.572
And we'll post a car
outside,

16:46.572 --> 16:48.174
make sure these punks
don't come back.

16:48.174 --> 16:50.309
Thank you.
I mean, who would do this?

16:50.309 --> 16:53.446
Do you think it could be
those crazy people who stand
around, holding up signs,

16:53.446 --> 16:55.681
like that woman who came up
to Cal on the street?

16:55.681 --> 16:57.850
No, they think
we're practically deities.

16:57.850 --> 17:00.119
They're trying to,
I don't know, worship us.

17:00.119 --> 17:02.889
I just don't see them throwing
bricks through our window.

17:02.889 --> 17:04.190
But we need to find out
who did.

17:04.190 --> 17:05.892
Let us do
the police work, okay?

17:05.892 --> 17:08.194
Guys, we'll get them,
all right?

17:13.432 --> 17:15.268
How much farther?

17:15.268 --> 17:17.703
We're close now.
It's just ahead.

17:32.385 --> 17:34.854
Here it is.

17:34.854 --> 17:36.622
It's amazing.

17:36.622 --> 17:39.258
I'm not a big fan.

17:45.498 --> 17:46.966
Got a thing
for rocks?

17:46.966 --> 17:49.168
I'm sending it
to my brother.

17:49.168 --> 17:51.237
Ah. He's got a thing
for rocks?

17:51.237 --> 17:54.040
He's got a thing
for puzzles,

17:54.040 --> 17:55.908
and this cave
just so happens to be

17:55.908 --> 17:57.710
part of a really,
really big one.

17:58.678 --> 18:02.515
Come on. Let's see what
the calling wants us to find.

18:09.188 --> 18:11.724
Hey, Ollie.

18:12.925 --> 18:17.430
How you...holding up
with all this?

18:17.430 --> 18:19.065
I'm okay.

18:19.065 --> 18:20.599
You know, it's kinda hard
to believe

18:20.599 --> 18:24.003
that there are people out there
that hate you and Cal.

18:24.003 --> 18:27.606
They don't hate us.
They...hate an idea.

18:27.606 --> 18:29.875
The idea
that you came back...

18:29.875 --> 18:31.410
different?

18:31.410 --> 18:34.780
But w-we didn't. We're the exact
same people who left.

18:35.948 --> 18:38.985
I know.
Except for the callings.

18:38.985 --> 18:40.653
Olive, how did you --

18:40.653 --> 18:44.290
Cal told me...
a long time ago.

18:45.558 --> 18:47.259
And here you are,
living.

18:47.259 --> 18:50.363
He said it was like trying to
keep a secret from himself.

18:50.363 --> 18:52.331
And he couldn't do it.

18:52.331 --> 18:53.432
The twin thing.

18:53.432 --> 18:55.401
Dad,
you could've told me.

18:55.401 --> 18:57.069
You could've trusted me.

18:57.069 --> 19:01.841
No. Honey, this has nothing
to do with trust.

19:01.841 --> 19:03.376
I trust you infinitely.

19:05.244 --> 19:07.179
I was trying
to protect you.

19:10.082 --> 19:14.954
Look, I know I don't get
the callings like you and Cal.

19:14.954 --> 19:17.089
But this?

19:17.089 --> 19:20.192
This is happening
to all of us.

19:21.494 --> 19:23.562
Okay.

19:23.562 --> 19:27.099
Starting now, it's a wide-open
book between you and me.

19:27.099 --> 19:30.236
No more secrets. Deal?

19:33.105 --> 19:34.507
Deal.

19:43.416 --> 19:46.685
Doesn't look like
a time-space portal, does it?

19:46.685 --> 19:49.622
No,
it looks like a cave.

19:58.164 --> 20:01.534
This is where I decided not
to burn your picture.

20:01.534 --> 20:04.503
Oh, thank you.

20:04.503 --> 20:06.205
No, thank you.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.974
Your photo was the one thing
that kept me going.

20:13.279 --> 20:17.349
I'm, uh, not totally sure
what we're supposed to find.

20:19.452 --> 20:21.387
Yeah, me either.

20:23.055 --> 20:25.191
Hey, Zeke,
you can't just --

20:25.191 --> 20:28.160
Zeke:
Go back. Go back.

20:29.328 --> 20:32.164
What the hell?
Why again?

20:32.164 --> 20:33.499
I don't know.
Maybe I was wrong.

20:33.499 --> 20:35.201
Maybe it's not about the cave.
I don't know.

20:35.201 --> 20:37.002
The calling said to go back,
but to go back where?

20:38.971 --> 20:41.373
The stars.

20:41.373 --> 20:42.975
We were hearing
your voice.

20:42.975 --> 20:45.244
Zeke, what do "stars"
mean to you?

20:49.381 --> 20:51.050
Zeke.

21:03.162 --> 21:06.932
I gave it to Chloe
for her 9th birthday.

21:06.932 --> 21:09.802
She loved it so much.

21:09.802 --> 21:11.871
And after s--

21:11.871 --> 21:13.906
I've worn it ever since.

21:15.141 --> 21:16.742
The calling wasn't
about the cave.

21:16.742 --> 21:18.644
It was about your sister.

21:21.981 --> 21:24.617
You came back here
because of her.

21:29.655 --> 21:31.724
Step 5.

21:31.724 --> 21:32.992
I don't --

21:32.992 --> 21:35.327
Alcoholics Anonymous.

21:35.327 --> 21:37.096
12 steps?

21:37.096 --> 21:40.199
I was stuck at 5 --

21:40.199 --> 21:42.768
"Admit to a higher power,
to ourselves,

21:42.768 --> 21:45.938
and to another human being
the exact nature of our wrongs."

21:48.874 --> 21:51.410
Zeke, what did you come here
to admit?

21:55.514 --> 21:57.316
That I killed her.

21:59.185 --> 22:01.387
I didn't mean to.

22:01.387 --> 22:03.789
But I killed
my little sister.

22:10.296 --> 22:11.564
Hey.

22:11.564 --> 22:12.598
Hey.

22:12.598 --> 22:13.632
Oh.

22:13.632 --> 22:14.733
-Sorry.
-Hi.

22:14.733 --> 22:16.101
Thank you for coming.

22:16.101 --> 22:18.037
Uh, if you couldn't say it
over the phone,

22:18.037 --> 22:20.005
I assume you have news.

22:20.005 --> 22:21.507
He's one of us.

22:21.507 --> 22:23.709
Zeke has the same
eschemic blood marker.

22:25.110 --> 22:27.213
So he wasn't lying.

22:27.213 --> 22:29.582
Whatever happened to us
on that plane

22:29.582 --> 22:31.584
also happened to Zeke
in his cave.

22:31.584 --> 22:32.751
Okay.

22:32.751 --> 22:35.354
Okay, w-we need to look
for any common properties

22:35.354 --> 22:36.722
between the plane
and the cave --

22:36.722 --> 22:38.424
uh, size, dimensions,
uh, I don't know,

22:38.424 --> 22:40.259
mineral composition,
ley lines, anything.

22:40.259 --> 22:42.995
I've already started
cross-referencing
maps of the area

22:42.995 --> 22:44.997
with weather data
from 2017.

22:44.997 --> 22:46.665
There was
an electrical storm

22:46.665 --> 22:48.334
in the center
of this blizzard, Ben.

22:48.334 --> 22:49.868
It's extremely rare,
but it can happen.

22:49.868 --> 22:51.070
Dark lightning?

22:51.070 --> 22:52.671
I can't prove it,
but it tracks.

22:52.671 --> 22:54.673
Zeke said he felt something
like an earthquake.

22:54.673 --> 22:58.244
Maybe that was the terrestrial
equivalent of the turbulence.

22:58.244 --> 22:59.745
This is so huge.

22:59.745 --> 23:01.747
We have an entirely new
data point.

23:01.747 --> 23:04.516
So, we can focus
our research on finding

23:04.516 --> 23:07.953
any similarities between
the two events, maybe more.

23:07.953 --> 23:09.021
Meaning what?

23:09.021 --> 23:10.623
Aftershock theory.

23:12.291 --> 23:14.393
The plane
was the earthquake.

23:14.393 --> 23:16.829
This is the aftershock.

23:25.204 --> 23:26.739
Jared got 'em.

23:26.739 --> 23:28.173
Got who?

23:28.173 --> 23:30.676
Uh, some people spray-painted
an "X" on our front door

23:30.676 --> 23:32.978
and then threw a brick
through our window.

23:32.978 --> 23:35.247
Ben, oh, my God.
Is everyone okay?

23:35.247 --> 23:37.583
Yeah, for now. But these people
seem to really hate us.

23:37.583 --> 23:39.952
They don't even think
we're human.

23:39.952 --> 23:41.920
Please be careful.

23:41.920 --> 23:43.822
I worry about you.

23:43.822 --> 23:46.392
Kind of wishing that 8B
was still around.

23:46.392 --> 23:48.394
Ben, the world
as we know it,

23:48.394 --> 23:51.163
from a scientific standpoint,
has changed.

23:51.163 --> 23:52.364
I am neck-deep in it.

23:52.364 --> 23:54.233
This is exactly where
I want to be.

23:54.233 --> 23:55.734
This is my happy place.

23:55.734 --> 23:57.970
Just please be careful.

24:02.274 --> 24:04.243
What do you mean
you killed her?

24:05.911 --> 24:08.314
I was 15.

24:08.314 --> 24:11.383
I thought I was too old to come
camping with my family.

24:12.217 --> 24:14.019
Chloe wasn't allowed to go
to the ravine,

24:14.019 --> 24:15.954
so I said
I would take her.

24:15.954 --> 24:17.456
But then...

24:17.456 --> 24:21.527
then I got a phone call
from some girl I barely knew.

24:21.527 --> 24:23.662
I should've said,
"I'll call you back in an hour,"

24:23.662 --> 24:26.198
but I was stupid...

24:26.198 --> 24:28.100
and selfish.

24:29.501 --> 24:31.203
And I told
my little sister,

24:31.203 --> 24:33.539
"Stop bugging me.
I'm on the phone."

24:35.274 --> 24:38.410
Those were the last words
I ever said to her.

24:40.779 --> 24:43.849
Less than an hour later,
they pulled her dead body up.

24:46.418 --> 24:49.655
There's a memorial
in her honor where she died,

24:49.655 --> 24:52.624
but I've never had the guts
to go see it...

24:52.624 --> 24:55.461
let alone tell my parents
what I did.

24:55.461 --> 24:58.330
I destroyed
my entire family.

25:00.099 --> 25:02.334
I've never told anyone.

25:02.334 --> 25:05.237
And it is eating me
alive with guilt.

25:05.237 --> 25:07.606
Zeke, you were
15 years old.

25:07.606 --> 25:09.174
No. P-Please, don't --
don't do that.

25:09.174 --> 25:10.743
Don't try to tell me
it wasn't my fault.

25:10.743 --> 25:12.778
No, it was.
It was your fault.

25:16.181 --> 25:19.852
My best friend was killed
in a car accident.

25:22.121 --> 25:24.656
I was driving,

25:24.656 --> 25:27.259
and I had...

25:27.259 --> 25:29.561
I'd been drinking.

25:31.463 --> 25:33.866
So, yeah, no matter what
the world wants to tell me,

25:33.866 --> 25:35.067
it was my fault.

25:38.570 --> 25:41.607
So, how do you move
forward?

25:43.208 --> 25:45.778
Step 5.

25:50.849 --> 25:53.619
I think I might know
what this voice wants.

25:55.354 --> 25:57.956
Maybe I'm supposed to go back
to Chloe's memorial,

25:57.956 --> 26:00.893
to where she died.

26:00.893 --> 26:02.861
Okay.

26:04.963 --> 26:07.833
So, why am I being interrogated
and not these passengers?

26:07.833 --> 26:09.668
Two of them stole
a damn airplane

26:09.668 --> 26:11.737
and were gonna fly into
who knows what

26:11.737 --> 26:14.206
till the military finally
shot it out of the sky.

26:14.206 --> 26:16.442
This guy's prints are
on the paint canister.

26:16.442 --> 26:18.710
He sells 'em,
and he touches all of 'em.

26:18.710 --> 26:21.413
And he says he has an alibi.
We'll look into it.

26:21.413 --> 26:23.081
So you don't think
he's involved?

26:23.081 --> 26:24.416
Oh, he's involved.

26:24.416 --> 26:26.452
Look at this.

26:26.452 --> 26:29.855
A few days ago, he registered
an anti-828 website.

26:29.855 --> 26:31.123
So, what do they do?

26:31.123 --> 26:34.092
They released these passengers,
these imposters,

26:34.092 --> 26:35.894
send them off
like seeds in the wind --

26:35.894 --> 26:38.597
seeds of hate, destruction,
terrorism.

26:38.597 --> 26:40.666
We need to track down
every one of them

26:40.666 --> 26:43.669
and stop them
before it's too late.

26:43.669 --> 26:47.239
If the government won't do it,
the people will.

26:50.809 --> 26:52.911
900 people on this site.

26:52.911 --> 26:55.113
Can we have it shut down?

26:55.113 --> 26:56.415
It's not
the only one, Ben.

26:56.415 --> 26:58.350
Ever since Daly
stole that plane,

26:58.350 --> 27:00.452
the idea that 828 passengers
are terrorists

27:00.452 --> 27:02.120
is starting to spread,
and fast.

27:02.120 --> 27:03.655
We're the terrorists?

27:03.655 --> 27:06.191
Nine of us, who were
experimented on like lab rats,

27:06.191 --> 27:07.793
are laying catatonic
in a facility

27:07.793 --> 27:09.995
under false identities
for their own protection.

27:09.995 --> 27:12.064
Kelly Taylor was murdered
for coming back.

27:12.064 --> 27:13.499
Harvey Stein
jumped off a building.

27:13.499 --> 27:14.733
We're not
the bad guys here.

27:14.733 --> 27:16.468
We just want to be
left the hell alone.

27:18.070 --> 27:21.440
Hey, Vasquez, got an update
on the armored car homicide.

27:21.440 --> 27:23.075
Give me a sec.

27:35.120 --> 27:37.956
Sorry.
Different case.

27:38.957 --> 27:40.459
Look, Ben.
Why don't you go home?

27:40.459 --> 27:41.860
There's nothing you can do here
right now.

27:41.860 --> 27:44.663
Sounds like there's nothing
anyone can do.

27:44.663 --> 27:48.033
We might have to let him walk
today, but we'll get him.

27:48.033 --> 27:49.434
Just give us some time.

28:07.553 --> 28:09.721
Chloe, I, uh...

28:12.624 --> 28:14.259
I...

28:15.460 --> 28:17.863
No, I can't do this.

28:22.000 --> 28:25.203
Okay. Okay.

28:25.203 --> 28:27.806
Why don't you just tell me
about her instead?

28:27.806 --> 28:30.042
Oh, this is where I talk
about how sweet

28:30.042 --> 28:32.277
and kind and smart
she was, right?

28:32.277 --> 28:33.812
I don't know.
Was she?

28:35.147 --> 28:36.815
No.

28:38.350 --> 28:41.553
I mean, she was smart.

28:41.553 --> 28:44.556
But God, she was bossy.

28:44.556 --> 28:46.425
She used to get this look
on her face,

28:46.425 --> 28:49.027
and I swear we would all
just step aside.

28:50.295 --> 28:53.498
One time at dinner, my parents
were onto me about my grades,

28:53.498 --> 28:55.801
not living up
to my potential,

28:55.801 --> 28:58.804
and Chloe summoned
this massive burp.

28:58.804 --> 29:01.740
I mean, like, the mother
of all belches.

29:01.740 --> 29:04.643
Everyone was laughing,
but my mom was like, "Chloe,"

29:04.643 --> 29:07.746
a-and Chloe turned to answer,
but instead let out another one.

29:09.381 --> 29:14.386
And she leaned over to me, and
she said, "You owe me big-time."

29:19.358 --> 29:21.226
And she was right.

29:21.226 --> 29:23.328
I do owe her.

29:31.069 --> 29:33.372
After my parents put this in,
they kept wanting me

29:33.372 --> 29:35.007
to come up here
and build a cairn.

29:35.841 --> 29:38.477
It's a little
stone monument.

29:39.978 --> 29:42.014
I used to build 'em
with Chloe.

29:44.316 --> 29:46.518
She called them
"fairy towers."

29:54.526 --> 29:56.061
Let's build one.

29:56.061 --> 29:57.963
Yeah?

29:59.965 --> 30:02.501
Okay.

30:02.501 --> 30:04.670
Can't just use
any old rock.

30:04.670 --> 30:06.738
We need flat surfaces,

30:06.738 --> 30:09.174
starting with the biggest,
flattest rock we can find.

30:09.174 --> 30:11.376
-Okay.
-And the stacking is precise.

30:11.376 --> 30:12.844
All right.

30:19.451 --> 30:21.019
Well, my plan
may not be much,

30:21.019 --> 30:23.055
but the new doorbell
kicks ass.

30:23.055 --> 30:24.656
Oh, you're crushing it.

30:25.957 --> 30:28.026
Here. I'll get that.

30:28.026 --> 30:29.861
What's this peacock?

30:29.861 --> 30:32.130
It's for
my mythology class.

30:35.500 --> 30:37.469
I think it may be
more than that.

30:37.469 --> 30:39.438
What do you mean?

30:41.406 --> 30:42.674
Okay.

30:42.674 --> 30:45.210
A few weeks ago,
I had a calling --

30:45.210 --> 30:47.045
a vision --
of a peacock.

30:47.045 --> 30:50.348
This -- This can't be
a coincidence.

30:50.348 --> 30:52.751
Well, what do you
want to know?

30:52.751 --> 30:56.521
All this ancient symbolism stuff
is kinda my jam.

30:56.521 --> 30:58.423
Well, I've done
some research,

30:58.423 --> 31:00.525
and peacocks are
an early Christian

31:00.525 --> 31:02.728
and Byzantine symbol
for resurrection.

31:02.728 --> 31:05.964
Well, they probably adopted it
from the Greeks and Romans,

31:05.964 --> 31:09.735
who thought peacocks
represented immortality.

31:09.735 --> 31:12.938
They were also messengers
for the goddess Juno.

31:12.938 --> 31:14.339
Messengers.

31:16.541 --> 31:18.810
This is a message.
Tell me more about Juno.

31:18.810 --> 31:20.879
Ben?
Have you seen your phone?

31:20.879 --> 31:23.281
-No. Why?
-Jared just texted.

31:23.281 --> 31:26.151
They let Cody Webber go.

31:31.623 --> 31:33.325
You know who I am?

31:33.325 --> 31:34.626
Yeah, I do.

31:34.626 --> 31:36.194
What the hell
are you doing here?

31:36.194 --> 31:37.863
You came to my home
to deliver a message.

31:37.863 --> 31:40.332
Now I have one for you.

31:40.332 --> 31:41.967
Stay away
from my family.

31:41.967 --> 31:43.902
Sure, we'll stay away
on one condition.

31:43.902 --> 31:46.872
You explain to us exactly
why you came back.

31:46.872 --> 31:49.174
-I had no control over this.
-Uh-huh.

31:49.174 --> 31:50.909
I suppose your pilot friend
had no control

31:50.909 --> 31:52.611
over the airplane
he stole.

31:53.745 --> 31:58.083
All of you are just
a ticking time bomb.

31:58.083 --> 31:59.818
It's a cute kid.

31:59.818 --> 32:01.486
I wonder if he bleeds.

32:06.892 --> 32:10.529
If you come anywhere near
a member of my family again,

32:10.529 --> 32:12.430
then you will know exactly
what someone

32:12.430 --> 32:13.732
who has already
died once...

32:13.732 --> 32:15.500
...is willing to do.

32:21.973 --> 32:23.842
Officers.

32:23.842 --> 32:25.977
Look. Look at what
they're posting.

32:25.977 --> 32:27.813
These are innocent people
they're threatening.

32:27.813 --> 32:29.147
Is that right?

32:29.147 --> 32:31.016
You come into my place
of business,

32:31.016 --> 32:33.685
threaten me,
destroy my property?

32:33.685 --> 32:36.354
And it was all
live-streamed.

32:55.006 --> 32:56.374
Hey, love?

32:56.374 --> 32:58.844
You should really stay inside
like we talked about.

32:58.844 --> 33:01.313
How long are they
gonna protect us?

33:03.448 --> 33:05.884
I don't know.
A while?

33:07.986 --> 33:11.256
What's up, Calamander?

33:11.256 --> 33:13.458
Sweetie, talk to me.

33:13.458 --> 33:15.760
What is it?
Are you scared?

33:18.196 --> 33:21.733
What's wrong with me?
Am I a freak?

33:21.733 --> 33:25.136
No.
Of course not.

33:26.171 --> 33:28.473
Cal, you can't listen
to those people.

33:28.473 --> 33:29.674
They don't know you.

33:29.674 --> 33:31.276
I don't know me, either.

33:31.276 --> 33:32.510
I do.

33:32.510 --> 33:35.247
I know you.

33:35.247 --> 33:38.450
But you don't know where I went
or how I came back.

33:38.450 --> 33:40.619
How do you know
I'm still me?

33:43.655 --> 33:47.359
Yeah, you're right. There are
a lot of things I don't know.

33:48.260 --> 33:51.162
But I know exactly
who you are.

33:52.697 --> 33:54.733
You're the little boy

33:54.733 --> 33:57.135
who spent the first three weeks
of preschool

33:57.135 --> 34:00.205
peeking out
from behind my leg.

34:00.205 --> 34:03.708
The kid who once put his hand
into this metal grate

34:03.708 --> 34:06.111
to pull out
a Matchbox car

34:06.111 --> 34:10.415
and cut his arm...
right here.

34:11.449 --> 34:13.718
-It was my third --
-Third-best Matchbox car?

34:13.718 --> 34:16.888
I know.
Because I know you.

34:16.888 --> 34:19.324
I would know
if you weren't you.

34:20.525 --> 34:22.127
A mom would know.

34:24.329 --> 34:26.364
I can see

34:26.364 --> 34:29.467
right into your heart,

34:29.467 --> 34:31.937
and you're you.

34:31.937 --> 34:34.539
You're my little boy,

34:34.539 --> 34:38.777
my very same little boy.

34:38.777 --> 34:42.414
But now I can do
some weird stuff.

34:42.414 --> 34:44.549
Some pretty awesome stuff.

34:44.549 --> 34:49.421
You want to know what
my favorite awesome
thing you can do is?

34:49.421 --> 34:51.456
Make a killer lasagna.

34:52.824 --> 34:55.160
What do you say?
You want to help?

35:08.106 --> 35:10.442
We were monitoring
his website.

35:10.442 --> 35:12.277
I had a squad car
posted a block away

35:12.277 --> 35:13.945
just waiting for him
to slip up.

35:13.945 --> 35:15.814
But instead...

35:15.814 --> 35:19.751
If you ever come anywhere near
a member of my family again,

35:19.751 --> 35:21.252
you will know exactly
what someone

35:21.252 --> 35:25.390
who has already died once
is willing to do.

35:25.390 --> 35:27.425
Because of your little
performance,

35:27.425 --> 35:30.228
his website's doubled
its traffic in the last hour,

35:30.228 --> 35:31.863
and it's growing
by the minute.

35:31.863 --> 35:34.065
Ben, you played
right into their hands.

35:34.065 --> 35:36.434
And you used me to get
his information, didn't you?

35:36.434 --> 35:38.269
Took it right off
my police report.

35:38.269 --> 35:40.138
I'm sorry, Jared,
but you know me.

35:40.138 --> 35:42.073
I'm not gonna just sit back
and wait

35:42.073 --> 35:44.342
for the next bad thing
to happen to my family.

35:44.342 --> 35:46.978
You can't go looking for it,
either.

35:46.978 --> 35:49.347
This is a desk appearance
ticket.

35:49.347 --> 35:52.484
They're letting you walk,
but if this happens again,

35:52.484 --> 35:54.019
I can't help you.

35:54.019 --> 35:55.920
Neither can Michaela.

36:28.319 --> 36:30.789
I think this is exactly
what I needed to do,

36:30.789 --> 36:32.957
and yet I don't feel
any better.

36:34.759 --> 36:36.828
Yeah, it's not magic.

36:36.828 --> 36:39.197
It's not gonna change
right away.

36:40.098 --> 36:42.534
But it begins to feel
less heavy.

36:42.534 --> 36:44.202
It's a start.

36:48.239 --> 36:51.676
I don't think there's anyone
else who can understand this,

36:51.676 --> 36:53.712
could understand me.

36:53.712 --> 36:55.346
Thank you.

36:56.714 --> 36:58.650
You're welcome.

36:58.650 --> 37:00.652
Michaela:
Go back. Go back.

37:03.655 --> 37:05.924
-Your voice.
-My voice.

37:08.827 --> 37:10.261
We're not done yet,
are we?

37:10.261 --> 37:11.763
Last time,
we heard your voice.

37:11.763 --> 37:13.331
But this time
we heard mine,

37:13.331 --> 37:15.400
so maybe you're supposed
to come back with me.

37:15.400 --> 37:16.501
Go back where?

37:16.501 --> 37:18.570
I don't know. Back home?
Back to the world?

37:18.570 --> 37:21.005
I'm not sure the world
wants me back.

37:21.005 --> 37:22.474
You have no idea how miserable
I made everyone.

37:22.474 --> 37:24.142
They do not want
to see me again.

37:24.142 --> 37:26.678
Zeke, your parents lost
both of their children.

37:26.678 --> 37:29.614
Could you imagine what
they would do to get
one of them back?

37:29.614 --> 37:31.449
Maybe.

37:31.449 --> 37:33.685
But just not yet.

37:33.685 --> 37:35.420
I need to do
a little work first.

37:35.420 --> 37:38.923
If this truly is my second
chance, I want to make it count.

37:40.725 --> 37:42.994
I'll go back with you.

37:42.994 --> 37:45.830
But me going back
into the world?

37:45.830 --> 37:47.565
That's for another day.

37:49.400 --> 37:51.369
Okay.

37:57.142 --> 37:58.710
Goodbye, Chlo.

37:58.710 --> 38:01.045
I love you.

38:34.412 --> 38:36.648
Sorry.
I should've knocked.

38:36.648 --> 38:38.616
No, it's fine.

38:38.616 --> 38:42.687
Besides, I saw you on
the new camera you installed.

38:42.687 --> 38:44.355
Thank you.

38:46.324 --> 38:47.926
You don't have
to do this.

38:47.926 --> 38:50.195
I do, actually.

38:50.195 --> 38:53.631
'Cause it's the only thing
I can do.

38:53.631 --> 38:56.801
Can't stop people from hating us
for no reason.

38:56.801 --> 38:59.938
I can't tell my son how or why
this is happening to him.

38:59.938 --> 39:02.407
So...the only thing
I can do

39:02.407 --> 39:05.877
is to try to take this ugly mark
off my family's house.

39:05.877 --> 39:09.581
So, please, just...
let me do it.

39:30.168 --> 39:32.570
It's our family.

39:38.142 --> 39:40.311
We're supposed to be
a team.

39:42.313 --> 39:44.315
This is your home.

39:46.684 --> 39:48.853
And I need you here.

39:52.757 --> 39:54.525
I need you here.

40:00.598 --> 40:02.667
I love you so much.

41:00.425 --> 41:03.127
It is beautiful
up here.

41:04.062 --> 41:05.263
I have an idea.

41:06.831 --> 41:09.467
How 'bout we just stay up here
and forget the world?

41:09.467 --> 41:11.636
I'm starting to like
this place again.

41:11.636 --> 41:15.106
But I'm assuming you have
something to get back to.

41:17.308 --> 41:19.344
I'm not exactly sure.

41:19.344 --> 41:21.646
But, yeah, I should
probably go deal with it.

41:23.514 --> 41:27.251
I just keep wishing that I could
redo my whole re-entry,

41:27.251 --> 41:30.822
but I'm not sure
what I would've done

41:30.822 --> 41:32.824
to change the way
that it turned out.

41:32.824 --> 41:36.461
Maybe that's why I was
supposed to find you --

41:36.461 --> 41:38.663
to help me change mine.

41:50.141 --> 41:53.378
Thanks.

41:53.378 --> 41:54.879
Hey.
