10:51.943 --> 10:54.059
I'LL TELL YOU WHY
I CAME, MR. WORDSWORTH.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.895
PERHAPS TO PROVE

10:58.032 --> 11:01.570
TO PROVE TO YOU THAT THE STATE
HAS NO FEARS, NONE AT ALL.

11:01.661 --> 11:04.323
NO, YOU WILL FORGIVE
ME, CHANCELLOR.

11:04.414 --> 11:06.781
THAT HAS ALL THE
ELEMENTS OF A JOKE.

11:06.875 --> 11:10.209
I MEAN, YOU COME TO MY ROOM TO PROVE
THAT THE STATE ISN'T AFRAID OF ME?

11:10.295 --> 11:12.753

YOUR STATE HAS EVERYTHING
CATEGORIZED, INDEXED, TAGGED.

11:37.864 --> 11:41.027

MIDNIGHT, ISN'T IT?

12:23.368 --> 12:25.325
YES, IN ABOUT 4O MINUTES.

12:25.411 --> 12:28.324
SEE, THEY BROUGHT THIS EQUIPMENT
HERE EARLY THIS AFTERNOON.

12:28.414 --> 12:32.499
THESE TWO MEN PUT THAT UP
IN LESS THAN 15 MINUTES.

12:32.585 --> 12:36.123
IT'S REMOTE CONTROL.
VERY EFFICIENT.

12:37.757 --> 12:40.124
WELL, WE'RE BEING
TELEVISED NOW.

12:40.218 --> 12:43.836
IT'S NOT UNUSUAL THAT VVE TELEVISE
EXECUTIONS, MR. VVORDSVVORTH.

12:43.930 --> 12:47.673
LAST YEAR, IN THE MASS EXECUTIONS,
VVE TELEVISED AROUND THE CLOCK.

12:47.767 --> 12:51.260
THIRTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE VVERE PUT
TO DEATH IN LESS THAN SIX HOURS.

12:51.312 --> 12:54.976
YOU NEVER LEARN, DO YOU?
HISTORY TEACHES YOU NOTHING.

12:55.066 --> 12:57.603
<i>ON THE CONTRARY, HISTORY
TEACHES US A GREAT DEAL.</i>

12:57.652 --> 13:00.815
VVE HAD PREDECESSORS VVHO HAD THE
BEGINNINGS OF THE RIGHT IDEA.

13:00.905 --> 13:03.146
YES, HITLER.

13:03.241 --> 13:06.654
HITLER, OF COURSE. STALIN, TOO. BUT
THEIR ERROR VVAS NOT ONE OF EXCESS.

13:06.744 --> 13:11.159
IT VVAS SIMPLY NOT GOING FAR ENOUGH. TOO
MANY UNDESIRABLES VVERE LEFT AROUND,

13:11.249 --> 13:14.367
AND UNDESIRABLES EVENTUALLY
FORM A CORE OF RESISTANCE.

13:14.460 --> 13:18.169
OLD PEOPLE, FOR EXAMPLE, CLUTCH AT
THE PAST AND VVON'T ACCEPT THE NEVV.

13:18.256 --> 13:20.623
THE SICK, THE MAIMED,
AN THE DEFORMED.

13:20.717 --> 13:24.631
THEY FASTEN ONTO THE HEALTHY BODY AND
DAMAGE IT, SO I/I/EELIMINATE THEM.

13:24.679 --> 13:28.638
<i>AND PEOPLE LIKE YOURSELF, THEY CAN PERFORM
NO USEFUL FUNCTION FOR THE STATE,</i>

13:28.725 --> 13:32.218
<i>SO WE PUT AN
END TO THEM.</i>

13:32.312 --> 13:37.182
VVHAT A CHARMING ROOM YOU HAVE, MR.
VVORDSVVORTH. HAVE YOU LIVED HERE LONG?

13:37.275 --> 13:40.313
OVER 2O YEARS. I BUILT
THAT FURNITURE MYSELF.

13:40.403 --> 13:42.519
YES, SO I UNDERSTAND,
MR. WORDSWORTH.

13:42.613 --> 13:45.901
THAT, INCIDENTALLY, HAS KEPT YOU
ALIVE, THAT PARTICULAR TALENT.

13:45.992 --> 13:48.484
CARPENTRY, YOU
SEE, IS A SKILL,

13:48.536 --> 13:52.746
AND THE STATE PROVIDES CONSIDERABLE LEEVVAY
FOR PEOPLE VVHO POSSESS CERTAIN SKILLS.

13:52.832 --> 13:57.668
UNFORTUNATELY, YOU VVENT AS FAR AS YOU
COULD GO, VVHICH VVAS INSUFFICIENT.

13:57.712 --> 14:02.673
SO, IN A FEVV MOMENTS, IT VVILL BE
THE END OF A RATHER FRUITLESS LIFE

14:02.717 --> 14:06.506
AND MR. ROMNEY
WORDSWORTH, LIBRARIAN,

14:08.056 --> 14:11.265
<i>GOES TO HIS
OWN NIRVANA.</i>

14:11.351 --> 14:16.517
THAT'S VVHAT THEY CALL IT IN YOUR
BOOKS, ISN'T IT, MR. VVORDSVVORTH?

14:16.564 --> 14:19.431
YOU AREN'T FACING THE
CAMERA, MR. WORDSWORTH.

14:19.525 --> 14:22.859
YOU'RE CHEATING YOUR AUDIENCE.
THEY VVANT TO SEE HOVV YOU DIE.

14:22.904 --> 14:28.024
PLEASE, MR. VVORDSVVORTH, TURN AROUND,
FACE THE CAMERA. THAT'S RIGHT.

14:28.076 --> 14:31.569
<i>DON'T STIFLE YOUR EMOTIONS. IF YOU
FEEL LIKE CRYING, GO AHEAD AND CRY.</i>

14:31.662 --> 14:34.040
OR IF YOU WANT TO PLEAD,
PLEAD, BY ALL MEANS.

14:34.123 --> 14:36.535
SOME HIGH STATE OFFICIAL
MIGHT TAKE PITY ON YOU.

14:36.626 --> 14:39.960
YES, THAT VVOULD PLEASE YOU, VVOULD IT?
A LITTLE ABJECT HAND-VVRINGING,

14:40.046 --> 14:42.413
CHEST POUNDING, FALLING DOVVN
ON MY HANDS AND KNEES.

14:42.507 --> 14:44.874
SUIT YOURSELF,
MR. WORDSWORTH.

14:44.926 --> 14:48.885
UNFORTUNATELY, I DON'T HA\/E TIME TO BE
ENTERTAINED BY THEM VVHEN THEY DO COME.

14:48.971 --> 14:52.714
I HAVE ANOTHER
APPOINTMENT THIS EVENING.

14:52.809 --> 14:55.016
CHANCELLOR.

14:56.687 --> 14:58.473
MAKE IT BRIEF,
MR. WORDSWORTH.

14:58.564 --> 15:01.932
YOU HAVE PLENTY OF TIME.
YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

15:02.026 --> 15:03.733
HOW'S THAT?

15:03.778 --> 15:06.566
I'M AFRAID I HAVEN'T
BEEN VERY FAIR WITH YOU.

15:06.614 --> 15:09.823
I INVITED YOU HERE
FOR A VERY SPECIAL REASON.

15:09.909 --> 15:14.324
VVOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOVV THE METHOD
THAT I'\/E CHOSEN FOR MY LIQUIDATION?

15:14.414 --> 15:17.748
VVELL, IN A VERY FEVV
MOMENTS, HERE IN THIS ROOM,

15:17.834 --> 15:19.916
<i>A BOMB IS GOING OFF.</i>

15:22.046 --> 15:24.629
VERY THOUGHTFUL,
MR. WORDSWORTH.

15:24.715 --> 15:27.127
RELATIVELY QUICK
AND PAINLESS DEATH.

15:27.218 --> 15:29.676
<i>YES, ISN'T IT? HOWEVER,</i>

15:29.762 --> 15:33.255
<i>KNOWING THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE BLOWN
TO SMITHEREENS IN A FEW MOMENTS,</i>

15:33.307 --> 15:36.436
ISN'T THE HAPPIEST THOUGHT
IN THE VVORLD, IS IT? IS IT?

15:36.477 --> 15:39.185
THAT DEPENDS ON THE INDIVIDUAL, MR.
VVORDSVVORTH.

15:39.272 --> 15:41.058
<i>INDEED IT DOES.</i>

15:47.071 --> 15:50.484
VVHAT KIND OF IDIOOY IS THIS, MR.
VVORDSVVORTH? YOU'\/E LOOKED THE DOOR.

15:50.575 --> 15:55.194
OH, YES, YES, I'\/E LOCKED THE DOOR.
NOVV, QUESTION,

15:55.288 --> 15:58.121
HOW DOES A MAN REACT
TO THE KNOWLEDGE

15:58.207 --> 16:02.371
THAT HE'S GONNA BE BLOVVN TO
BITS VVITHIN A HALF AN HOUR?

16:02.462 --> 16:06.501
ANSWER: THAT DEPENDS
ON THE INDIVIDUAL.

16:10.428 --> 16:12.385
SO, FOR MYSELF,

16:13.681 --> 16:15.888
I'M GOING TO SIT DOWN

16:15.975 --> 16:18.558
<i>AND READ MY BIBLE.</i>

16:18.644 --> 16:21.477
IT'S BEEN HIDDEN
HERE FOR OVER 2O YEARS.

16:21.522 --> 16:24.230
IT'S A CRIME
PUNISHABLE BY DEATH,

16:24.317 --> 16:29.062
SO IT'S THE ONLY POSSESSION THAT I HA\/E
THAT HAS ANY \/ALUE AT ALL TO ME.

16:29.155 --> 16:31.772
SO I'M GOING TO JUST
SIT DOWN AND READ IT

16:33.409 --> 16:36.993
UNTIL THE MOMENT
OF MY DEATH.

16:37.038 --> 16:40.326
HOVV VVILL YOU SPEND YOUR
LAST MOMENTS, CHANCELLOR?

16:40.374 --> 16:43.867
THIS IS INSANE, WORDSWORTH.
LET ME OUT OF HERE.

16:47.840 --> 16:51.253
LET ME OUT OF HERE, SOMEONE!
GUARDS, SOMEONE, ANYONE!

16:51.344 --> 16:55.338
YOU'RE CHEATING THE AUDIENCE.
YOU'RE NOT FACING THE CAMERAS.

16:56.724 --> 16:58.761
GUARDS, SOMEBODY
DOWN THERE!

16:58.851 --> 17:01.684
THERE IS NO SENSE IN VVASTING YOUR BREATH.
THERE'S NOBODY THERE.

17:01.729 --> 17:05.393
THAT'S ONE OF THE RULES YOU MADE UP YOURSELF:
ISOLATE THE PERSONS TO BE LIOUIDATED.

17:05.483 --> 17:08.349
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID.
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.

17:08.444 --> 17:11.527
I THINK THAT THERE'S NO ONE THERE,
SO VVHY DON'T YOU FACE THE CAMERA?

17:11.571 --> 17:14.030
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT.
YOU SAID SO YOURSELF.

17:14.116 --> 17:17.575
I'M BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND, A SHOE ON THE
OTHER FOOT. THAT'S THE IDEA, ISN'T IT?

17:17.662 --> 17:20.950
IT'S ONE THING FOR SOMEONE LIKE YOURSELF
TO DO A LITTLE ORINGING, PLEADING,

17:21.040 --> 17:24.282
BUT VVHAT A CHOICE OPPORTUNITY TO SHOVV
A MEMBER OF THE STATE DOING LIKEVVISE.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.789
BUT YOU'RE INSANE IF YOU THINK
THEY'LL LET ME STAY HERE.

17:26.878 --> 17:30.622
"THEY"? I ASK CLARIFICATION
OF THE TERM "THEY."

17:30.716 --> 17:34.926
AH, YOU MEAN THE STATE! OH, I THINK
THEY'LL SIT ON THEIR HANDS FOR AVVHILE.

17:35.012 --> 17:37.299
THEY WOULDN'T WANNA
MISS THIS SCENE.

17:37.390 --> 17:41.099
<i>BESIDES, THE ACT OF RESCUE WOULD
BE VERY DEMEANING TO THEM.</i>

17:41.185 --> 17:45.804
<i>TO HAVE TO BREAK IN HERE AND RESCUE
A HIGH-RANKING MEMBER OF THE STATE,</i>

17:45.898 --> 17:48.481
TO SNATOH HIM OUT OF
THE SOUP, SO TO SPEAK.

17:48.568 --> 17:50.980
NO, I THINK THEY
WON'T HELP YOU.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.811
I MISJUDGED
YOU, WORDSWORTH.

17:52.905 --> 17:55.067
YOU UNDERESTIMATED ME.

17:55.157 --> 17:58.286
YOU VVANTED THE VVHOLE COUNTRY TO
SEE THE VVAY THAT A LIBRARIAN DIES.

17:58.369 --> 18:02.658
<i>WELL, LET THE WHOLE COUNTRY SEE THE WAY
AN OFFICIAL OF THE STATE DIES, TOO.</i>

18:02.748 --> 18:06.241
FACE THE CAMERAS,
STEP INTO THE LIGHT.

18:06.335 --> 18:09.669
<i>LET THE WHOLE COUNTRY SEE
THE STRENGTH OF THE STATE,</i>

18:09.755 --> 18:12.964
<i>THE RESILIENCE OF THE STATE,
THE COURAGE OF THE STATE.</i>

18:13.050 --> 18:17.169
<i>LET THE WHOLE COUNTRY SEE THE WAYA
VALIANT MAN OF STEEL FACES HIS DEATH.</i>

18:17.263 --> 18:19.630
YOU HAVE A NIRVANA
COMING UP, TOO.

18:19.724 --> 18:24.434
VVHY DON'T YOU JUST SIT DOVVN?
VVE'LL HA\/E A LITTLE CHAT.

18:24.520 --> 18:28.764
JUST YOU AND ME,
AND THE GREAT EQUALIZER,

18:28.816 --> 18:32.855
'CAUSE DEATH IS
A GREAT EQUALIZER.

18:34.739 --> 18:36.980
SO HERE YOU HAVE,

18:37.074 --> 18:40.192
YOU HAVE THIS STRONG,
HANDSOME, UNIFORMED,

18:40.286 --> 18:43.824

OF GIANT AUTHORITY,

18:43.914 --> 18:47.282

INSIGNIFICANT LIBRARIAN,

18:47.376 --> 18:51.711
AND SUDDENLY,
IN THE EYES OF GOD,

18:51.797 --> 18:55.085
THERE IS PRECIOUS
LITTLE TO DISTINGUISH US.

19:07.146 --> 19:10.138
