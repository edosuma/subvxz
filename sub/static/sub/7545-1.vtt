01:43.093 --> 01:45.448
Antwone. He's here.

01:45.613 --> 01:48.411
Antwone's here.

01:49.373 --> 01:51.443
That's Antwone.

01:56.093 --> 01:58.766
Antwone?

02:59.333 --> 03:02.325
First call. First call.

03:18.053 --> 03:21.363
-Damn. Berkley?
-What?

03:21.573 --> 03:24.371
-You been in there 1 0 minutes.
-Shut up.

03:24.533 --> 03:28.526
One day chief's gonna catch you
taking them Hollywood showers.

03:28.853 --> 03:31.890
I should snitch on you.
Come on, move, man.

03:32.053 --> 03:35.363
-Get out of my way, snitch.
-Come on, move. Yeah.

03:36.453 --> 03:37.681
Got you, man.

03:39.653 --> 03:40.802
Quit playing, man.

03:46.933 --> 03:47.968
What's cracking, Fisher?

03:48.133 --> 03:51.091
Your head if you don't
get away from me.

03:51.373 --> 03:52.726
What is that on your face?

03:55.213 --> 03:59.001
Say something else. Say something.
You're always talking.

03:59.173 --> 04:01.004
Get off him.

04:01.213 --> 04:04.728
-Why do you gotta fight? Relax.
-I'm cool, man. I'm cool.

04:06.213 --> 04:07.851
Punk mother--

04:10.973 --> 04:15.046
Petty Officer Fisher, you're accused
of violating article 1 28:

04:15.213 --> 04:19.091
Assault on a superior
non-commissioned officer.

04:19.253 --> 04:21.447
-How do you plead?
-Guilty, sir.

04:21.613 --> 04:26.448
In your statement, you say your attack
on Petty Officer Berkley was provoked. . .

04:26.613 --> 04:30.288
-. . .by a racial slur. Is that correct?
-Yes, sir.

04:30.493 --> 04:33.803
Petty Officer Berkley, did you make
any racial remarks to Officer Fisher?

04:34.013 --> 04:35.048
No, sir.

04:35.213 --> 04:37.124
-Stand at attention!
-Stand at attention.

04:41.013 --> 04:46.167
This is the United States Navy, son.
I find you guilty.

04:46.333 --> 04:51.532
There'll be a forfeiture of $200.
You're restricted to the ship for 45 days.

04:51.933 --> 04:54.447
And you'll perform 45 days extra duty.

04:54.613 --> 04:59.289
I'm reducing you from petty officer
third class to ship serviceman seaman.

04:59.733 --> 05:03.772
And I'm recommending that you be
evaluated at the psychiatric clinic. . .

05:03.933 --> 05:07.448
. . .before our next underway period.
You're dismissed.

05:10.333 --> 05:11.448
-What happened?
-How'd it go?

05:11.613 --> 05:14.173
Same old, same old.
I gotta go to the psych clinic.

05:14.333 --> 05:16.324
-The nut house?
-Farmer, shut up.

05:16.493 --> 05:19.246
Give it up to the shrink?
Damn.

05:33.853 --> 05:36.242
See you next week.

05:38.853 --> 05:41.526
Seaman Fisher.

05:43.013 --> 05:45.368
Right this way.

05:52.173 --> 05:55.290
I understand this is not your first time
here. You saw Dr. Williams?

05:55.493 --> 05:57.006
No, he saw me.

06:00.733 --> 06:02.803
-That's your wife?
-Yes.

06:04.853 --> 06:07.413
Have a seat.

06:13.613 --> 06:18.289
-I understand you like to fight.
-It's the only way some people learn.

06:18.453 --> 06:21.684
But you pay the price
for teaching them.

06:23.373 --> 06:25.841
-You wanna talk about it?
-About what?

06:26.013 --> 06:28.402
Whatever's bothering you.

06:28.573 --> 06:30.848
Why's something gotta be bothering me?

06:31.013 --> 06:36.167
Why? Because I jumped on a white boy,
something must be wrong with me?

06:36.333 --> 06:42.568
"Send him to the psychiatrist. Nigger
tried to kill his master. He must be crazy. "

06:42.973 --> 06:45.282
-You looking for a discharge?
-I ain't looking for nothing.

06:45.453 --> 06:49.446
-That's where you're headed.
-If I want out of the Navy, I'll just leave.

06:49.613 --> 06:53.447
-Unauthorized absence?
-If that's what the Navy calls it.

06:53.733 --> 06:55.325
Running away how you handle problems?

06:55.493 --> 06:58.007
I don't have no problems.

06:58.933 --> 07:01.606
Where you from, Fisher?

07:05.573 --> 07:07.564
-Where'd you spend your childhood?
-Cleveland.

07:07.733 --> 07:09.769
Parents still live there?

07:09.933 --> 07:12.686
-I never had any parents.
-They deceased?

07:14.053 --> 07:16.931
I never h--
I never had parents.

07:17.893 --> 07:21.852
That would make you a medical miracle,
Seaman Fisher. Where you from?

07:22.933 --> 07:25.572
I'm from under a rock.

07:26.813 --> 07:28.849
Okay.

07:29.333 --> 07:30.766
Okay.

07:30.933 --> 07:34.846
All right, I'm gonna see you next week.

07:35.013 --> 07:36.731
-I ain't coming back.
-Why not?

07:36.893 --> 07:40.522
-Because there's nothing wrong with me.
-I agree with you there.

07:40.693 --> 07:42.445
See you next week.

07:43.333 --> 07:46.484
See the receptionist on your way out.

07:53.093 --> 07:54.731
Next Wednesday, 1 400.

08:34.773 --> 08:37.446
Walker. Philip Walker.

08:37.653 --> 08:40.645
That was the name of the last guy
who stalked me.

08:41.253 --> 08:43.049
-I'm busted.
-Yeah, you're busted.

08:43.493 --> 08:45.723
-What's up? Where you been?
-I'm on restriction.

08:45.893 --> 08:47.406
-Again?
-Yeah.

08:48.253 --> 08:52.292
-How did you get off the ship?
-I just came from the medic.

08:52.493 --> 08:54.006
Why?

08:54.173 --> 08:58.246
Well, I'm working on this high priority
paper for this commander.

08:58.413 --> 09:04.045
-What kind of paper?
-I'm not at liberty to talk about it now.

09:04.213 --> 09:07.489
Well, I was gonna invite you
to a party.

09:08.413 --> 09:10.005
Me?

09:10.173 --> 09:11.492
Yeah, you.

09:12.813 --> 09:17.204
-I'm on restriction.
-Yeah, you told me.

09:17.533 --> 09:20.286
I gotta-- You know--
I'm gonna get back to the ship.

09:20.493 --> 09:24.008
They're probably looking for me
right about now, so. . . .

09:24.173 --> 09:28.166
I'll talk to you.
Damn.

09:31.253 --> 09:33.813
See you when you're off restriction.

09:38.093 --> 09:39.526
Yes.

09:41.973 --> 09:43.486
Yeah, send him in.

09:46.013 --> 09:49.164
Get your monkey hands off me, man.

09:51.693 --> 09:56.209
I thought you may have forgotten your
way, so I sent an escort team for you.

09:56.413 --> 10:00.486
You may be able to make me come here,
but you can't make me talk.

10:00.653 --> 10:03.451
Thank you. You're dismissed.

10:07.813 --> 10:10.566
You don't wanna talk to me?

10:11.813 --> 10:15.408
Let me lay this out for you.
This is how many cases I have, okay?

10:15.573 --> 10:20.567
I don't have time to waste.
I get three sessions only. . .

10:20.733 --> 10:23.964
. . .to make an eval and a recommendation
to your commanding officer.

10:24.133 --> 10:26.283
You know he wants to throw you
out of the Navy.

10:26.493 --> 10:30.247
You can sit here and not talk.
But our sessions don't begin. . .

10:30.413 --> 10:33.450
-. . .until you begin talking to me.
-I got nothing to say.

10:33.653 --> 10:34.881
Okay.

10:35.053 --> 10:38.762
Then we'll sit until you do.
We can sit here until the day I retire.

10:38.933 --> 10:41.049
-Doesn't matter to me.
-Me either.

10:41.253 --> 10:42.368
-All right.
-What about the brig?

10:42.533 --> 10:44.808
-What about it?
-Send me to the brig.

10:46.613 --> 10:49.844
There's the brig right there.
Lock yourself up.

11:25.653 --> 11:30.443
What do you know, time's up.
See you next week. 1 400.

12:04.613 --> 12:06.843
Want some chips?

12:51.093 --> 12:53.527
-What?
-I didn't say anything.

12:55.013 --> 12:58.369
-I thought you said something.
-I was just clearing my throat.

12:58.893 --> 13:01.088
Okay.

13:05.693 --> 13:08.332
Maybe you're coming down
with something.

13:08.493 --> 13:10.961
I'm all right.

13:13.813 --> 13:16.407
-It's just. . . .
-Just what?

13:17.813 --> 13:24.048
It's just a waste of time sitting here,
week after week. Wasting time.

13:24.413 --> 13:27.883
I don't want you
to waste your time, Antwone.

13:33.053 --> 13:35.806
So, what you want me to say?

13:36.413 --> 13:39.325
It's not what I want you to say. . .

13:39.493 --> 13:42.405
. . .it's what you wanna tell me.

13:46.413 --> 13:50.008
Maybe you can start by asking me
a question. Get things going.

13:50.173 --> 13:54.849
I can do that. You said you come
from under a rock. What did you mean?

13:55.133 --> 14:00.446
I don't know.
It's the first thing that come to my mind.

14:01.133 --> 14:07.447
-What do you think it means?
-Well, it could mean. . .

14:07.613 --> 14:10.889
. . .that you feel under pressure. . .

14:11.053 --> 14:15.649
. . .that you feel a weight pressing down
on you. That you're in the dark, alone.

14:15.853 --> 14:18.572
-You said you had no parents.
-I had parents.

14:18.773 --> 14:20.764
Okay.

14:21.773 --> 14:24.571
-Only three sessions, right?
-Only three.

14:28.853 --> 14:31.413
My father's name was Edward.

14:33.133 --> 14:35.522
-So you knew him?
-No.

14:36.053 --> 14:39.602
-I didn't even know his last name.
-Do you know where he is?

14:39.773 --> 14:41.729
-Yeah, I know where he is.
-You ain 't--

14:45.613 --> 14:48.252
He went to his ex-girlfriend's house.

14:48.413 --> 14:51.883
They got into an argument.
She killed my father.

14:52.053 --> 14:55.250
-Where was your mother at the time?
-Behind bars.

14:55.413 --> 14:57.131
I see.

14:57.293 --> 15:00.524
I was born in prison two months
after my father was murdered.

15:00.693 --> 15:04.083
-Why was she confined?
-I don't know.

15:04.253 --> 15:07.563
-All I know is what I told you.
-So you were turned over to the state?

15:07.733 --> 15:11.282
Yep. The state placed me
in this orphanage.

15:11.453 --> 15:16.083
It was supposed to be until
my mother got out to claim me.

15:16.253 --> 15:18.448
She got out but she never claimed me.

15:18.613 --> 15:21.889
-How long were you there?
-Two years.

15:22.053 --> 15:24.248
How's that make you feel, Antwone?

15:26.533 --> 15:29.923
-I don't know.
-You must have some feelings about it.

15:30.493 --> 15:33.212
What did it feel like?

15:34.213 --> 15:38.252
-Rainy days.
-Like rainy days? Okay.

15:38.413 --> 15:40.643
Why is that?

15:41.373 --> 15:43.682
You know, in Cleveland. . .

15:43.853 --> 15:47.163
. . .it rains, not all the time. . .

15:47.333 --> 15:50.609
. . .but to a kid who wants
to go out and play. . .

15:50.773 --> 15:54.652
. . .it seems like it rains every day.
But. . . .

15:54.813 --> 15:58.442
Kids expect it to rain sometimes. . .

15:58.613 --> 16:01.730
. . .but for one kid, it rained too much.

16:05.453 --> 16:07.045
Okay.

16:08.773 --> 16:12.448
-You want me to come back next week?
-Yes, I do.

16:12.613 --> 16:16.686
-You ever try to find her, your mother?
-No, sir.

16:17.213 --> 16:19.169
Okay. Next week.

16:25.333 --> 16:27.244
Busy day?

16:28.373 --> 16:30.762
No more than usual.

16:32.973 --> 16:36.761
-These tomatoes are from our garden.
-Yeah?

16:43.533 --> 16:46.605
They're so much better than last year.

16:50.893 --> 16:55.409
I'm no green thumb or anything,
but who knows? Maybe I'm learning.

17:06.893 --> 17:10.169
These tomatoes really are good.

17:27.053 --> 17:30.363
When I was 2, I was placed
in the Tate foster home.

17:30.533 --> 17:33.047
Reverend Tate, he was
a fire-breathing preacher.

17:33.213 --> 17:34.885
He had his own storefront church.

17:35.293 --> 17:39.764
There was only a few members.
There was Mrs. Tate, Cousin Nadine...

17:39.933 --> 17:41.252
...my foster brothers:

17:41.413 --> 17:44.211
Keith. Keith was half-white.

17:44.373 --> 17:48.082
Dwight. And me.

17:50.013 --> 17:53.688
There was church three times on Sunday,
Bible study on Tuesday...

17:53.853 --> 17:58.005
... YPWW meetings on Thursday,
choir rehearsal on Friday.

17:58.213 --> 18:04.402
We learned if we caught the Holy Ghost,
Mrs. Tate would give us vanilla wafers.

18:04.573 --> 18:07.371
So we'd catch it every Sunday.

18:15.533 --> 18:19.242
Good God! Come on, church!
Celebrate!

18:19.413 --> 18:23.531
Reverend Tate, he didn't like Dwight
at all.

18:23.693 --> 18:25.843
He said he had too much pride.

18:26.013 --> 18:29.369
So he tried to beat it out of him.

18:29.533 --> 18:32.445
Sometimes he would even try
to beat him to death.

18:33.093 --> 18:35.004
-Did he beat you?
-No, sir.

18:35.693 --> 18:38.491
I think he pitied me.

18:39.293 --> 18:42.683
I liked him for it.
But I was ashamed of him.

18:44.573 --> 18:47.371
What about Mrs. Tate?

18:48.173 --> 18:50.050
What about her?

18:50.213 --> 18:53.808
I don't know which one of you
no-good, rotten, hard-headed niggers. . .

18:53.973 --> 18:56.692
. . .put your dirty hands on my walls.

19:05.253 --> 19:08.689
But I bet I'll get the right one.

19:09.533 --> 19:13.890
I took you in when your
no-account mammies threw you away.

19:14.173 --> 19:17.370
And this is the thanks I get?

19:19.213 --> 19:22.410
You ungrateful niggers.

19:43.573 --> 19:45.450
Now I know I got the right one.

19:45.653 --> 19:48.213
She used to brag about...

19:49.893 --> 19:53.806
. . .beating me unconscious.

19:58.093 --> 20:01.244
She threatened to do it again.

20:02.173 --> 20:04.607
But she never did.

20:04.813 --> 20:07.407
Why do you think she never did?

20:08.013 --> 20:09.969
Maybe she was scared.

20:11.613 --> 20:14.173
She found a new way
to get me, though.

20:15.453 --> 20:19.412
-So you like fire, huh?
-No, Mu-deah. I don't like fire.

20:23.093 --> 20:29.566
You stay away from things
that don't belong to you.

20:29.973 --> 20:31.964
You hear me?

20:32.453 --> 20:34.011
-You hear me?
-Yes, Mu-deah.

20:34.173 --> 20:36.448
-You hear me?
-Yes.

20:37.973 --> 20:40.692
Dumb nigger.

20:49.493 --> 20:53.008
I tried everything I could
to get her to like me.

20:53.173 --> 20:55.403
Nothing ever worked.

20:55.613 --> 20:58.286
Were you the youngest
of the foster children?

20:58.493 --> 21:01.087
Dwight was the youngest.

21:01.253 --> 21:04.768
I was in the middle,
and Keith was the oldest.

21:04.933 --> 21:08.812
Mrs. Tate used to put us against
each other so much. . .

21:08.973 --> 21:11.009
. . .we started hating each other.

21:11.173 --> 21:14.802
But I think deep down inside,
we really hated ourselves.

21:15.013 --> 21:17.129
-What do you mean?
-Keith was half-white.

21:17.293 --> 21:20.410
She would try to compare Keith
to me and Dwight.

21:20.573 --> 21:23.804
He had the good hair,
we had the bad hair.

21:24.013 --> 21:28.131
She used to say Keith was better than us
because his father was white.

21:31.013 --> 21:33.846
I wished I was Keith.

21:34.013 --> 21:36.971
Not even Keith could escape
from being called a nigger.

21:37.173 --> 21:40.882
She hardly used our names,
she said "nigger" so often.

21:41.053 --> 21:46.252
Called us nigger so often, we could tell
who she meant by the way she said it.

21:46.533 --> 21:50.651
-What happened to Dwight and Keith?
-Dwight's in Lucasville State Penitentiary.

21:50.813 --> 21:53.646
Keith got taken back by his mother.

21:53.813 --> 21:56.885
He was raped by one of her boyfriends.

21:58.533 --> 22:01.809
-Did that ever happen to you?
-Hell, no.

22:02.973 --> 22:05.203
Okay.

22:07.853 --> 22:11.528
Was Mrs. Tate ever. . .?
Was she ever nice to you?

22:11.693 --> 22:16.005
Yeah, there were times.
Sometimes she would tell her friends. . .

22:16.173 --> 22:18.562
. . .that we were good kids.
That she was proud of us.

22:18.733 --> 22:21.850
-Chummy times.
-Chummy times?

22:22.293 --> 22:26.923
I could tell what kind of day it was gonna
be by the scent in the air when I awoke.

22:27.133 --> 22:30.842
-How could you tell?
-If I awoke to the smell. . .

22:31.013 --> 22:36.565
. . .of grits and eggs or water steaming
off pavement as she hosed it down. . .

22:36.733 --> 22:39.293
. . .I had to look out all day.

22:39.453 --> 22:42.092
But if I smelled pancakes,
everything was okay.

22:42.693 --> 22:44.729
She make pancakes very often?

22:44.893 --> 22:46.292
No, sir.

22:46.573 --> 22:50.486
I can delay my next appointment
if you wanna talk some more.

22:50.653 --> 22:51.881
No, sir.

22:55.533 --> 22:57.603
Hey, Slim?

22:57.973 --> 22:58.962
What?

22:59.133 --> 23:02.523
-You going home next leave?
-Yeah, gotta tend to the flock.

23:02.853 --> 23:07.768
When I get leave, I'm gonna be like
a vampire coming to town with his coffin.

23:07.933 --> 23:11.767
-A place to lay down before I get down.
-What's that mean?

23:11.933 --> 23:16.848
-Shut up. People are trying to sleep.
-Shut your grouchy ass up. Jesus!

23:17.453 --> 23:19.171
When you going home, Pork Chop?

23:19.853 --> 23:23.004
When your mama quits tripping
and sends me my money.

23:23.973 --> 23:27.090
What about you, Fish?
When are you going home?

23:27.253 --> 23:30.768
Fish? Fish?

23:50.613 --> 23:53.446
Last night I had a dream about Jesse.

23:53.613 --> 23:56.571
-Who was Jesse?
-He was my best friend.

23:56.733 --> 24:01.170
When I wasn 't at home, I was wherever
Jesse was for three reasons:

24:01.333 --> 24:04.052
One was, being his friend,
he wouldn 't beat me up.

24:04.213 --> 24:05.965
Jesse, look. I got five.

24:06.133 --> 24:09.284
The other reasons were
so he wouldn 't beat me up.

24:09.453 --> 24:11.045
-I only got three.
-I liked him a lot.

24:11.213 --> 24:13.044
Give me yours.

24:24.013 --> 24:26.368
We used to drive
our friend Kenny crazy.

24:26.573 --> 24:28.131
Let's get Kenny.

24:28.293 --> 24:31.763
Kenny hung around me for
the same reasons I hung around Jesse.

24:31.973 --> 24:34.885
-Kenny, let me see.
-Where's Jesse?

24:37.853 --> 24:40.686
Stop! Stop!
Get them out! Get them out!

24:40.853 --> 24:44.163
-Kenny, what's wrong?
-Kenny, don't forget to write.

24:44.493 --> 24:47.405
Mrs. Tate, she hated Jesse.

24:47.573 --> 24:50.645
She hated seeing us together even more.

24:51.493 --> 24:56.044
But she couldn 't keep us apart.
I was so happy when she kicked me out.

24:56.213 --> 24:58.852
Twonny?

25:02.613 --> 25:05.366
That hoodlum nigger Jesse called
here asking for you.

25:05.533 --> 25:07.842
Said y'all are going
to the picture show.

25:08.053 --> 25:10.442
Now that's the devil's work.

25:10.653 --> 25:13.247
Who told you you could go
to the picture show anyhow?

25:13.413 --> 25:16.803
Where'd you get the money, nigger?
Did you steal it?

25:16.973 --> 25:21.285
-I told you, I've been raking lawns.
-Well, you would've stole it.

25:21.453 --> 25:26.322
Give me the money.
I said, give me your money.

25:31.133 --> 25:33.089
You don't know what to do
with no money.

25:33.293 --> 25:35.284
That's why I never let you have none.

25:35.453 --> 25:38.092
Why you always gotta make things
difficult for me?

25:38.253 --> 25:42.087
Difficult. Difficult?

25:42.253 --> 25:45.211
-Where'd you learn such fancy words at?
-Ain't no fancy word.

25:45.413 --> 25:47.051
-Don't sassy me.
-Ain't no one sassing.

25:47.213 --> 25:49.169
-Don't sassy me!
-Ain't no one sassing you.

25:51.893 --> 25:56.569
You ain't gonna beat me no more.
No more!

25:57.613 --> 25:59.843
Lord Jesus.

26:00.573 --> 26:03.645
I want you out of my house.

26:03.813 --> 26:06.247
And who do you think
will take you in, huh?

26:06.413 --> 26:10.008
Retarded nigger.
Don't nobody want you.

26:10.373 --> 26:13.206
Your damn mammy
didn't even want you.

26:13.413 --> 26:16.371
Give me my shoe.

26:16.533 --> 26:20.082
Must have felt pretty good
when you took that shoe from her.

26:20.253 --> 26:22.926
It felt like I was gonna go
right upside her head.

26:23.093 --> 26:25.891
-I just chilled.
-Why'd you chill?

26:26.053 --> 26:27.930
I don't know.

26:28.573 --> 26:31.133
Well, I'm glad you did.

26:31.853 --> 26:33.650
How'd you feel?

26:34.373 --> 26:36.967
I felt like I won a prize.

26:37.133 --> 26:39.647
-But it scared me.
-Why?

26:39.933 --> 26:43.164
It was the first time
I ever felt more powerful than her.

26:43.333 --> 26:46.006
It was like a surprise.

26:46.773 --> 26:50.607
-What ever happened to Jesse?
-We lost touch. You know how it is.

26:51.453 --> 26:55.924
This may be helpful to understand
the mentality of people like the Tates.

26:56.093 --> 27:00.769
Here. It's called The Slave Community.

27:00.973 --> 27:04.807
-Why understand somebody beating me?
-What you went through was, in part. . .

27:04.973 --> 27:08.648
. . .the result of the treatment slaves
received from their masters. . .

27:08.813 --> 27:12.283
. . .and passed on to their children,
generation to generation.

27:12.453 --> 27:15.251
Right on down to the Tates.

27:15.413 --> 27:17.404
Sir, that sounds like an excuse.

27:17.573 --> 27:20.167
-I was a kid.
-I understand.

27:20.333 --> 27:23.882
-Sounds like you're taking up for them.
-What they did was wrong.

27:24.053 --> 27:27.887
They made the wrong choices.
This is not about them, it's about you.

27:28.093 --> 27:30.482
You were sent to me
because you have an anger problem.

27:30.653 --> 27:32.564
Well, you've got the right to be angry.

27:32.733 --> 27:37.170
But you have to learn to channel
that anger, to use it constructively.

27:37.333 --> 27:41.121
Instead of getting into fights,
go to the gym, hit the bag, lift weights.

27:41.813 --> 27:46.045
You have to use that energy
to better yourself.

27:46.213 --> 27:51.287
You're taking Japanese classes, right?
Okay, you're already on the right track.

27:51.453 --> 27:54.092
Can we talk about this next week?

27:54.693 --> 27:58.003
Three sessions, son. That's all
I'm given to make a recommendation.

27:58.213 --> 28:01.569
I'm gonna recommend
that you be given a second chance.

28:01.733 --> 28:05.203
That is what you want, isn't it?
To stay in the Navy?

28:05.373 --> 28:09.446
-Yes, sir.
-Okay. Okay. Stay out of trouble.

28:19.293 --> 28:22.524
-How you doing?
-I'm cool.

28:22.693 --> 28:25.605
-You don't seem cool.
-I'm all right.

28:26.693 --> 28:29.844
-You still working on that paper?
-No, I'm finished.

28:30.013 --> 28:33.688
-I went through there for a shortcut.
-Where you going?

28:33.893 --> 28:36.123
Nowhere.

28:38.253 --> 28:41.882
I gotta go.
Cheryl, I'll talk to you later.

28:48.933 --> 28:50.844
Why you always talking
about somebody's mama?

28:51.013 --> 28:55.404
We ain't talking about somebody's
mama. We're talking about your mama.

28:55.573 --> 29:00.408
Hey, Fish. I bet you won't be fighting
no more honkies on this boat.

29:00.573 --> 29:05.044
-This ain't no boat, this a ship.
-This a ship.

29:05.213 --> 29:07.681
Country-ass Negro.
Who let you in the Navy?

29:08.813 --> 29:13.204
Fish, what's that book you're reading?

29:13.373 --> 29:17.525
Let me see the cover.
The Slave Community?

29:17.693 --> 29:20.730
-What you reading that shit for?
-Because I want to.

29:20.933 --> 29:25.131
This ain't no slave ship.
And these ain't no slavery days.

29:25.333 --> 29:28.564
I can't tell.
You're the only Uncle Tom on the ship.

29:28.733 --> 29:33.488
You're a part-time brother.
Grayson, why you always talking shit?

29:33.653 --> 29:36.611
-What I do got nothing to do with you.
-Better get out of my face.

29:36.773 --> 29:39.924
Either you trying to hang out
with the brothers or the white boys.

29:40.093 --> 29:42.482
-Make up your mind.
-Sit your ass down.

29:42.693 --> 29:45.366
-What you gonna do?
-Come on, Fish. Stop!

29:45.533 --> 29:48.570
-Let him go!
-You're weak, Fish.

29:50.333 --> 29:52.563
Thank you, sir.

29:52.733 --> 29:54.803
Who's next?

29:57.453 --> 30:03.244
So, Dr. Davenport, sent him
to the gym? Hit the punching bags?

30:03.413 --> 30:05.847
Ain't that what you're prescribing?

30:06.053 --> 30:08.613
So why you here?

30:09.813 --> 30:14.284
You feeling under pressure?
You feel like a rock is on top of you?

30:14.453 --> 30:16.444
Come on, speak the hell up.

30:16.613 --> 30:20.003
Better make it snappy,
you only got three sessions coming.

30:20.173 --> 30:24.451
What are y'all looking at?
What you looking at? You feeling sick?

30:24.613 --> 30:26.843
Do you need a healing?
Do you need a healing?

30:27.013 --> 30:29.368
Do you need a healing?
Do you need a healing?

30:29.573 --> 30:32.485
Some of you sick sailors need
to come back after working hours.

30:32.653 --> 30:36.009
That's when the good Dr. Davenport
will lay his hands on you.

30:36.213 --> 30:40.206
Or he may have a book
with the answers to all your questions.

30:40.373 --> 30:43.331
Ain't that right?!

30:44.973 --> 30:47.487
Ain't that right?

30:49.813 --> 30:51.929
Would you like to step into my office?

30:59.373 --> 31:02.092
-Are you finished?
-I thought I was just getting started.

31:02.293 --> 31:04.090
It may have slipped your mind. . .

31:04.253 --> 31:07.529
. . .but you're addressing
a superior officer. You understand me?

31:07.693 --> 31:10.446
-Do you understand me?
-Yes, sir. I slipped up.

31:10.613 --> 31:12.524
You better believe you did.

31:12.693 --> 31:16.447
No, sir. I mean I slipped up
when I talked to you.

31:16.613 --> 31:18.683
-What?
-Three sessions, right?

31:18.853 --> 31:20.969
-That's correct.
-Can't flout regulations.

31:21.133 --> 31:25.365
-That's correct.
-Well, what do I do, commander?

31:25.533 --> 31:27.808
Because I don't know what to do.

31:30.173 --> 31:33.006
I don't know what to do.

31:53.413 --> 31:55.165
Tired?

32:00.653 --> 32:03.247
How was your day?

32:05.213 --> 32:08.205
Long. Not complaining, though.

32:08.373 --> 32:12.651
Well, don't wait up.
I've got a lot of work to do.

32:12.813 --> 32:14.451
I know.

32:17.093 --> 32:19.891
-Good night.
-Good night.

32:23.173 --> 32:28.327
-It's nice to be off restriction.
-Yeah, I'm gonna be squared away for a--

32:28.493 --> 32:31.246
-Want something from the Exchange?
-What's up with the Exchange?

32:31.413 --> 32:33.643
You spend more time there
than on restriction.

32:33.853 --> 32:36.003
-Just trying to be a good shipmate.
-I'm kidding.

32:36.173 --> 32:38.528
-Bring me some Skittles.
-And a Snickers.

32:38.693 --> 32:40.331
-Pork skins.
-And a sandwich. Thanks.

32:40.493 --> 32:42.211
All right.

32:44.573 --> 32:47.007
What are you doing here, sir?

32:47.173 --> 32:50.006
I was in the area and saw your ship. . . .

32:50.373 --> 32:54.730
You just saw this big old ship
moored alongside the pier?

32:56.933 --> 33:01.165
I wanna see you back in my office
next Wednesday, after knockoff.

33:01.733 --> 33:04.486
That is, if you wanna continue.

33:04.653 --> 33:07.531
I think I need to check
my calendar first.

33:07.693 --> 33:10.332
-Sir.
-Okay.

33:10.493 --> 33:13.803
-You let me know, okay?
-Yes, sir.

33:43.013 --> 33:45.163
Hey, Cheryl.

33:46.013 --> 33:48.163
-What's going on?
-Nothing.

33:48.333 --> 33:51.131
-You just getting off work?
-Yeah.

33:53.173 --> 33:55.050
You mad?

33:55.893 --> 33:58.532
Why would I be mad?

34:01.573 --> 34:03.689
I'm sorry.

34:03.853 --> 34:06.287
That's cool.

34:06.453 --> 34:09.286
-So you finally off restriction?
-Yeah.

34:11.373 --> 34:14.045
-So you can hang out now?
-Yeah.

34:14.213 --> 34:17.011
So, what about now? I'm off.

34:17.172 --> 34:22.929
No, I promised I'd meet somebody
in a few minutes, so. . . .

34:23.572 --> 34:27.282
-What's her name?
-No, it ain't like that.

34:28.413 --> 34:30.290
What about tomorrow?

34:32.213 --> 34:36.842
What about the day after tomorrow?
It's a Wednesday. After knockoff?

34:37.013 --> 34:39.891
-That'd be better.
-Okay.

34:40.092 --> 34:43.210
Meet me in the lobby
of the female barracks at 1 700.

34:44.652 --> 34:48.931
-Okay. I'll meet you at 1 700.
-All right.

34:49.132 --> 34:51.522
It's a date.

34:57.413 --> 34:58.926
-Are we done?
-Yes, we are.

34:59.093 --> 35:01.891
-Can I ask you a question?
-Sure.

35:04.053 --> 35:08.968
You think it's possible for somebody
who's had problems all their life. . .

35:09.133 --> 35:11.931
. . .not to stay that way?

35:12.093 --> 35:15.210
-Think it's possible they can change?
-Absolutely. Why?

35:15.413 --> 35:17.643
-No reason.
-Want something to drink?

35:17.933 --> 35:20.891
-No, I'm good.
-Okay.

35:22.413 --> 35:26.326
You know when you
kind of meet somebody. . .

35:26.493 --> 35:29.690
-. . .if you had problems, it wouldn't--
-Who is she?

35:30.293 --> 35:34.332
-What's her name? What's her name?
-Cheryl.

35:34.493 --> 35:38.122
-She works at the Exchange.
-That's a good thing. Keep it Navy.

35:38.293 --> 35:40.204
Right? So?

35:40.973 --> 35:42.770
So. . . .

35:43.413 --> 35:45.881
Have you spoken to her yet?

35:46.053 --> 35:48.647
Yeah, I've spoken to her. . .

35:48.813 --> 35:53.489
-. . .but I get caught up, tongue-tied.
-Everybody's awkward at first.

35:53.693 --> 35:56.127
-Not like me.
-Everybody is, trust me.

35:56.333 --> 35:58.085
-Even you?
-Even me. Everybody.

35:58.573 --> 36:00.086
So?

36:02.573 --> 36:04.689
-We're going out tonight.
-Good.

36:04.853 --> 36:07.526
We were supposed to go out
a couple days ago. . .

36:07.693 --> 36:12.892
. . .but I just wanted to clear my head,
take some time. . .

36:13.053 --> 36:15.408
-. . .talk to you first.
-Okay.

36:16.813 --> 36:21.045
-So, what should I do?
-Well, she's a nice girl?

36:21.213 --> 36:23.363
-Yeah.
-Obviously you like her?

36:23.533 --> 36:26.730
Okay. I think you should just
go out with her.

36:28.373 --> 36:34.846
Sometimes it helps to take the anxiety
out of a future meeting to role-play.

36:35.173 --> 36:38.722
-What's that?
-You play yourself. I'll play Cheryl.

36:38.893 --> 36:42.932
I'll ask some questions.
We'll have a conversation. Okay?

36:43.093 --> 36:46.768
-You'll play Cheryl?
-Okay, now. That's right.

36:46.933 --> 36:48.844
I'm man enough to play Cheryl.

36:49.013 --> 36:52.562
Okay. . . . You go first.

36:53.533 --> 36:56.843
-No.
-I'll go first. So. . . .

36:58.293 --> 37:01.330
-How you doing?
-Fine.

37:01.573 --> 37:05.088
Good. Good.
So where are we gonna go?

37:06.893 --> 37:08.406
Out.

37:11.173 --> 37:12.765
See.

37:15.493 --> 37:17.324
-I'm hungry. You?
-I could eat.

37:17.493 --> 37:19.085
See, that's good. You got it.

37:19.253 --> 37:21.687
-You think so?
-You've got nothing to worry about.

37:21.853 --> 37:26.085
I'm gonna give you my phone number.
If you have any questions. . .

37:26.253 --> 37:29.768
. . .you can call me,
anytime of day or night.

37:30.733 --> 37:34.362
-Have fun. Give me a call, okay?
-We're gonna be fine.

37:34.573 --> 37:38.282
Okay. You never know, son. These
things, sometimes they can escalate.

37:38.493 --> 37:40.245
Escalate into what?

37:40.733 --> 37:43.486
My wife and I went out.
It escalated to marriage.

37:43.693 --> 37:45.524
We're not escalating to marriage.

37:45.693 --> 37:50.562
All right, good. You get out of here.
Have fun. Hey, have fun, okay?

37:50.733 --> 37:53.293
-I will.
-Okay. See you later.

37:54.493 --> 37:57.485
-No escalating.
-No escalating.

38:03.133 --> 38:04.248
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

38:04.413 --> 38:06.005
You're welcome.

38:08.493 --> 38:10.563
-What is this?
-Frappuccino.

38:10.733 --> 38:12.849
-Frappuccino?
-Yeah. You like it?

38:13.013 --> 38:17.404
-Six dollars?
-What do you care how much it costs?

38:17.573 --> 38:21.930
All the money we're making.
That's why I joined the Navy, you know?

38:22.093 --> 38:24.732
See the world. Build a fortune.

38:24.893 --> 38:27.248
I don't know what to do
with all the money I got.

38:27.413 --> 38:30.803
Okay, now tell me why
you really joined the Navy.

38:31.453 --> 38:32.681
-For real?
-Yeah, for real.

38:32.853 --> 38:35.925
All right. Well. . . .

38:36.093 --> 38:39.210
My father's a Navy man,
Vietnam vet. . .

38:39.373 --> 38:44.606
. . .and his boys were gonna grow up
and join and serve just like he did.

38:44.773 --> 38:48.482
Only one little problem.
He didn't have any boys.

38:48.653 --> 38:51.565
-So you. . .?
-So l. . . . Yep.

38:53.533 --> 38:56.809
It's worth it, you know?

38:56.973 --> 39:01.046
Even if I hated the Navy,
which I don't. . .

39:01.213 --> 39:07.686
. . .it's worth it just to see his eyes shine
when I put on that uniform.

39:08.653 --> 39:12.885
-So you and him are close?
-Yeah, we're close.

39:14.653 --> 39:18.612
Can't wait to go home for Thanksgiving.
You going home?

39:18.773 --> 39:20.809
I'm gonna go home.

39:27.213 --> 39:31.365
-I'm kind of hungry. How about you?
-I could eat.

39:33.133 --> 39:34.691
What?

39:36.453 --> 39:39.126
-Nothing.
-What?

39:39.333 --> 39:41.972
-What?
-You sure?

39:43.973 --> 39:47.852
-You should've ordered some.
-I just wanted one.

39:48.013 --> 39:52.052
These are good. Vegetables are good
for you. Wanna try some?

39:52.213 --> 39:53.805
Go on, try it.

39:53.973 --> 39:59.206
It's good. It's got white cabbage,
purple cabbage, yellow cabbage.

40:00.733 --> 40:03.042
Nasty cabbage.

40:05.013 --> 40:06.287
Damn.

40:07.173 --> 40:10.165
It's not that bad.

40:12.893 --> 40:14.531
So. . .

40:16.013 --> 40:19.562
. . .what do you like to do?
Or what do you wanna do?

40:19.733 --> 40:23.009
-What would you like to do?
-What I'd like to do?

40:28.693 --> 40:31.002
-I wanna teach.
-Yeah?

40:31.173 --> 40:34.290
-My mother was a teacher.
-For real?

40:35.413 --> 40:40.851
I think teaching is a powerful position,
you know?

40:41.013 --> 40:45.564
-You get to give to kids and all that.
-I think you'll make an excellent teacher.

40:45.733 --> 40:48.850
Really? Thank you.

40:49.013 --> 40:50.810
I think. . . .

40:52.253 --> 40:53.891
I think you're beautiful.

40:57.213 --> 40:59.773
Thank you.

41:01.253 --> 41:04.370
-What?
-It's just funny. . . .

41:04.533 --> 41:09.368
I mean nice, what happens
to your mouth when you smile.

41:09.973 --> 41:13.090
One side curls up higher
than the other. Did you know that?

41:13.293 --> 41:15.443
-No.
-It's cute.

41:15.853 --> 41:18.447
-Thank you.
-You shouldn't hide it, you know?

41:18.613 --> 41:22.970
You should smile more often.
It's good for you.

41:30.133 --> 41:32.089
Here we are.

41:32.253 --> 41:36.883
-You had a good time?
-Yeah, I had a great time. Thank you.

41:42.493 --> 41:44.688
-Good night.
-Good night.

41:52.013 --> 41:54.243
-What is that?
-Japanese.

41:55.573 --> 41:58.246
That meant,
"It gave me a great pleasure. . .

41:58.413 --> 42:00.608
. . .to spend this evening with you. "

42:00.773 --> 42:03.685
-Cool. That was beautiful.
-Thank you.

42:05.173 --> 42:10.691
So how do they say, "Maybe we can
do this again some time"?

42:10.853 --> 42:13.651
I don't know.

42:14.533 --> 42:19.049
-Well, let me know.
-I will. Good night.

42:22.133 --> 42:25.170
-Good night.
-Good night.

42:31.293 --> 42:33.887
Hell, yeah. I kissed her, man. Shoot.

42:34.053 --> 42:36.726
But I ain't getting
into intimate details with you.

42:36.893 --> 42:39.805
For real. That's just how it is.

42:39.973 --> 42:43.807
That's my girl. I respect her.
And?

42:43.973 --> 42:45.326
Mind yours, mind yours.

42:47.053 --> 42:49.521
God, that made me look like a pizza.

42:58.613 --> 43:02.162
-Hey. How you doing?
-Hey.

43:10.773 --> 43:13.890
-What you doing?
-Organizing.

43:14.053 --> 43:17.602
-Organizing?
-These pile up.

43:18.933 --> 43:21.766
You could start off
by getting rid of that one.

43:21.933 --> 43:24.845
-You're gonna have to get in line.
-Yeah?

43:25.013 --> 43:28.642
I remember that one.
Get rid of that one too.

43:28.973 --> 43:31.328
Look at. . . .

43:32.133 --> 43:36.729
-A lifetime ago.
-Not to me.

43:40.693 --> 43:43.161
Let me see this.

43:47.493 --> 43:49.723
What?

43:51.773 --> 43:55.322
How long are we gonna do this?
Are you gonna keep ignoring me?

43:55.493 --> 43:58.690
Come on, baby.
What are you talking about? I mean--

43:58.853 --> 44:00.730
We just having a good time.
Why--?

44:00.893 --> 44:03.327
You're gonna act like you don't know
what I'm talking about?

44:03.493 --> 44:05.961
I don't know what you're talking about.

44:08.013 --> 44:12.609
-You do know what I mean.
-I'm hungry. I walk in. . . .

44:18.133 --> 44:21.728
Talk to me. Jerome?

44:23.413 --> 44:25.165
-She kissed me.
-What?

44:25.333 --> 44:27.528
She kissed me. I didn't even push her.

44:27.693 --> 44:30.446
I walked her home, threw some
Japanese on her, and she kissed me.

44:30.613 --> 44:34.003
-Listen, Seaman Fisher--
-I'm sorry for knocking on your door. . .

44:34.173 --> 44:37.131
. . .but I had to. I had to talk to you.

44:37.773 --> 44:41.129
-Hello. Sorry for busting in on you.
-This is highly irregular.

44:41.293 --> 44:44.888
I don't know what to do.
We're underway to Mexico next week. . .

44:45.053 --> 44:48.011
-. . .and I'm getting serious with her.
-She'll be here when you get back.

44:48.173 --> 44:51.688
-How do you know?
-If she has a fraction of your bounce. . .

44:51.893 --> 44:53.246
. . .she'll be here. I guarantee.

44:53.453 --> 44:56.126
-I should just chill?
-That's a good suggestion.

44:56.373 --> 45:00.764
-Okay. I won't do this again.
-Thank you very much. Good night.

45:00.933 --> 45:04.164
-Thank you, sir.
-You're welcome.

45:08.493 --> 45:11.883
-Who was that?
-A patient of mine.

45:13.613 --> 45:16.411
He was on his first date.

45:16.573 --> 45:20.088
He was so excited,
he couldn't wait to tell me about it.

45:20.453 --> 45:22.364
Well, don't cure him.

47:12.693 --> 47:17.050
Show me what you're working with.
Show me what you're working with!

47:50.813 --> 47:55.568
I don't know about you, but if my math
is right, we're a lady short at this table.

47:55.733 --> 47:58.691
You didn't know?
Fish just got himself a girlfriend.

47:58.893 --> 48:02.408
-She's in the Navy, right?
-He writes to her every minute he can.

48:02.573 --> 48:04.882
Just so romantic.

48:07.813 --> 48:10.646
-I don't understand.
-You understand.

48:13.533 --> 48:15.125
-I don't--
-She wants to mate.

48:15.333 --> 48:16.925
Do the dance. Understand?

48:17.093 --> 48:20.608
-Come. Come.
-No, I'm fine.

48:20.813 --> 48:24.965
Let her oil the old slave down. What your
girlfriend don't know won't hurt you.

48:25.173 --> 48:27.323
-Come on, get up.
-I don't want to.

48:27.493 --> 48:29.404
You don't what?

48:31.293 --> 48:34.808
-Leave him alone, Grayson.
-He didn't answer my question.

48:34.973 --> 48:39.091
-What question?
-You don't what?

48:39.253 --> 48:44.008
I've never seen you with a girl.
Man says he's got a girlfriend, right?

48:44.213 --> 48:48.206
Well, anybody ever met her?

48:48.413 --> 48:52.452
Anybody? Don't worry about it,
sweetheart.

48:52.613 --> 48:57.209
You see, he's a cherry boy.
Never been to the sugar shack.

48:57.373 --> 48:59.648
-Too scared to go.
-Fuck you, Grayson.

48:59.853 --> 49:02.162
-Huh? What'd you say?
-You heard me.

49:02.373 --> 49:05.922
Fuck me?
With all these women in here. . .

49:06.293 --> 49:09.842
. . .you want me?
See what I mean, brothers?

49:10.173 --> 49:13.324
Hell, I'm worried about you, Fish.
I mean. . .

49:13.493 --> 49:15.882
. . .all this action up in here. . .

49:16.053 --> 49:18.886
. . .why you don't want no woman?

49:19.293 --> 49:21.523
Yeah. Faggot.

49:24.013 --> 49:26.368
Here we go again.

49:27.053 --> 49:28.327
Get off him!

49:37.573 --> 49:39.291
Davenport.

49:47.293 --> 49:50.251
What time does his plane get in?

49:52.493 --> 49:56.042
Okay. No, I understand.

49:56.213 --> 49:58.044
I understand.

49:58.213 --> 50:01.091
Okay, just let me talk to him first.

50:01.253 --> 50:02.971
All right. Thank you.

50:33.493 --> 50:36.803
I thought we were
all done fighting, Antwone?

50:37.733 --> 50:39.610
Let me in.

50:45.093 --> 50:47.766
Your XO wired the statements
of your shipmates.

50:50.053 --> 50:53.090
Now, do you wanna start
at the beginning?

51:00.453 --> 51:03.331
You're gonna have to talk to me, son.

51:05.173 --> 51:07.926
You better tell me something
because I'm all you got right now.

51:08.133 --> 51:11.808
I'm trying to work things out,
but you gotta give me something.

51:11.973 --> 51:14.362
-I don't know what to say.
-Tell me what happened.

51:14.573 --> 51:16.882
-They were fronting me.
-What do you mean?

51:17.053 --> 51:19.851
Some of the guys were bagging on me.

51:20.013 --> 51:22.447
-I couldn't take it.
-How so?

51:26.253 --> 51:28.528
It's just. . . .

51:29.693 --> 51:32.844
Just making jokes.

51:33.213 --> 51:35.204
What kind of jokes?

51:38.293 --> 51:42.445
Jokes about me with women.

51:42.613 --> 51:44.126
I wasn't taking it.

51:45.893 --> 51:50.409
What kind of jokes about you being
with women, Antwone?

51:50.573 --> 51:53.292
Jokes like me being a virgin.

51:56.733 --> 52:01.443
-Are you?
-I don't know. I might be.

52:01.613 --> 52:03.763
Okay.

52:03.973 --> 52:07.170
Why do you think
you haven't been with a woman?

52:15.613 --> 52:18.002
Think about it, son.

52:18.413 --> 52:20.290
There must be a reason.

52:20.453 --> 52:24.492
You're a good-looking young man.
Must have had many opportunities.

52:24.653 --> 52:27.406
-Maybe you don't like women.
-I like women.

52:27.573 --> 52:30.451
-Maybe you don't care about sex.
-I care about sex.

52:30.613 --> 52:34.811
-I think about it all the time.
-We're back where we started.

52:34.973 --> 52:38.807
Then how come you've never been
with a woman?

52:40.293 --> 52:43.205
-I have.
-Okay.

52:44.133 --> 52:46.442
When?

52:48.613 --> 52:51.844
-When?
-When I was young.

52:52.013 --> 52:55.005
-It was a kiss.
-Okay.

52:55.173 --> 52:59.166
-How was it?
-I hated it.

52:59.333 --> 53:02.848
-It was terrible.
-Why?

53:03.013 --> 53:06.528
-I threw up.
-Why?

53:08.413 --> 53:12.645
-Why?
-Because. . . .

53:15.013 --> 53:20.724
Because she put her tongue in my mouth.
She always did.

53:25.333 --> 53:28.803
-That's my mama.
-You said the other lady was yours.

53:28.973 --> 53:31.771
-I changed.
-Boy, you can't change.

53:31.933 --> 53:34.447
-That's my mama.
-Nigger?

53:34.613 --> 53:36.569
-Nigger, you hear me calling?
-That's you.

53:36.733 --> 53:38.803
-I said, nigger.
-Coming, Mu-deah.

53:39.013 --> 53:43.291
-Dwight? Keith?
-Yes, Mu-deah. Here I come.

53:43.733 --> 53:46.122
Get your behinds down here.

53:46.333 --> 53:49.564
I told you all
not to mess up your clothes.

53:49.733 --> 53:54.090
Nadine, we're gonna be downtown
at the Social Service office.

53:54.253 --> 53:57.563
-All right.
-Twonny, you stay with Nadine.

53:58.093 --> 53:59.606
Yes, Mu-deah.

54:33.693 --> 54:37.686
Twonny, what you looking at
out there?

54:41.333 --> 54:42.891
What you looking at?

54:52.493 --> 54:55.087
That's it.

55:00.653 --> 55:03.531
Give me some sugar.

55:11.493 --> 55:14.291
Now get on downstairs.

55:15.013 --> 55:18.403
What did I say?
Get on downstairs.

55:18.573 --> 55:22.043
Get in that basement and drop them.

55:35.453 --> 55:36.852
Hurry up.

55:37.013 --> 55:40.289
Yeah, unbutton them all.
Come on.

55:40.453 --> 55:43.172
I said, come on.

55:43.693 --> 55:45.843
Pull them down.

55:46.013 --> 55:50.291
You heard me, pull them down.
Pull them over my feet.

55:50.453 --> 55:52.762
Now come over here close.

55:52.933 --> 55:56.050
Closer. You don't have to be afraid.

55:56.213 --> 56:00.604
Now touch me.
You know you want to.

56:00.773 --> 56:03.731
Yeah, that's it. Kiss me.

56:03.893 --> 56:07.090
Come on, I said, kiss me.

56:08.493 --> 56:11.326
Baby, give me some sugar.

56:14.013 --> 56:16.971
-Antwone!
-I'm gonna tell on you.

56:32.573 --> 56:35.451
What's up, man? You all right?

56:35.653 --> 56:38.167
Come on in.

56:48.933 --> 56:51.288
You all right?

56:54.933 --> 56:57.845
She did it again?

56:59.653 --> 57:02.531
She hit you too?

57:05.573 --> 57:08.451
It's okay, Antwone.
You can stay here.

57:08.613 --> 57:12.288
I'll look after you. Come on,
let's get you a shirt.

57:19.773 --> 57:24.403
She made me. . . .
She made me do these things.

57:26.373 --> 57:29.683
I was only a little boy.

57:33.293 --> 57:36.603
If there was something I wouldn't do,
she would beat me.

57:37.093 --> 57:40.324
And Jesse was the only one
you ever told?

57:40.493 --> 57:42.324
Yes, sir.

57:43.013 --> 57:45.208
She's the only woman
I've ever seen naked.

57:47.293 --> 57:49.443
I'm almost 25 years old.

57:53.453 --> 57:56.331
I've never done it.

57:56.493 --> 57:58.484
That's embarrassing.

58:00.453 --> 58:03.126
I hate it.

58:26.533 --> 58:30.526
-Yes, can I help you with something?
-Hi, Mrs. Davenport. I'm Seaman Fisher.

58:30.733 --> 58:33.042
-Antwone Fisher.
-What can I do for you?

58:33.213 --> 58:35.443
I'm here to see the commander.
I'm one of his patients.

58:35.613 --> 58:39.970
-He told me to meet him here.
-Well, he's not home yet. But. . . .

58:41.093 --> 58:44.324
Well, come on inside. You can wait.

58:50.573 --> 58:53.963
-Would you like some cider?
-Sure. Thank you.

58:55.373 --> 58:57.648
Seems you're getting ready
for Thanksgiving, ma'am.

58:57.813 --> 58:59.929
Don't call me "ma'am,"
you'll make me feel old.

59:00.093 --> 59:03.483
Call me Berta.
Are you going home for the holidays?

59:03.653 --> 59:07.441
No, but the chief cook on the ship
is planning a big meal. I'll be there.

59:07.653 --> 59:12.249
-That sounds nice. Here you go.
-Thank you very much.

59:13.813 --> 59:19.524
First thing I saw the first time I was
in his office, it was you.

59:19.733 --> 59:24.523
It was your picture. I thought
you had a nice face, a good face.

59:24.693 --> 59:28.572
And that maybe he's all right
if he married a woman like you.

59:28.773 --> 59:30.684
You ready to get started?

59:30.853 --> 59:32.366
Yes, sir.

59:34.533 --> 59:38.162
-Nice meeting you.
-It was very nice to meet you too.

59:43.453 --> 59:45.728
I was just trying to be nice.

59:45.893 --> 59:49.203
Why don't you try being nice
on that ship?

59:49.373 --> 59:51.841
Have a seat.

59:54.853 --> 59:58.812
-I like your house.
-Thank you. Tell me about your house.

59:58.973 --> 01:00:01.726
-Your house the day you left your family.
-Sir?

01:00:01.933 --> 01:00:04.891
The Tates, when they threw you out.
Tell me about that.

01:00:05.093 --> 01:00:08.165
It was back to the orphanage.

01:00:08.333 --> 01:00:12.326
They told me I needed
to develop my social skills.

01:00:12.773 --> 01:00:17.164
Nobody was into adopting
teenage boys.

01:00:19.053 --> 01:00:21.886
They sent me to a reform school
in Pennsylvania.

01:00:22.053 --> 01:00:25.568
That's where I got
my excellent skills I have now.

01:00:25.733 --> 01:00:29.487
-What then?
-I was on my own.

01:00:29.653 --> 01:00:32.929
A social worker took me
to a men's shelter.

01:00:33.093 --> 01:00:36.005
She gave me $67. . .

01:00:37.213 --> 01:00:41.411
-. . .and she said goodbye.
-How long were you at the shelter?

01:00:41.573 --> 01:00:45.088
-Just till the next morning.
-Then?

01:00:45.253 --> 01:00:47.926
I slept on a few park benches
and I came here.

01:00:48.293 --> 01:00:52.081
-To my house?
-No, sir. I joined the Navy.

01:00:55.933 --> 01:00:59.130
That's it.
That's the Antwone Fisher story.

01:01:01.293 --> 01:01:05.809
Okay. That is it.
You're done for the day.

01:01:05.973 --> 01:01:08.885
Don't talk to my wife anymore either.
You hear me?

01:01:09.053 --> 01:01:11.169
-Yes, sir.
-All right.

01:01:25.413 --> 01:01:27.290
-Seaman Fisher.
-Sir?

01:01:27.493 --> 01:01:29.165
Get up here.

01:01:29.413 --> 01:01:33.884
-What'd I do?
-Cut the jaw-jacking. Up here right now.

01:01:34.413 --> 01:01:37.450
I don't know what you think
you're up to, but you better be careful.

01:01:37.613 --> 01:01:39.683
-I didn't do anything.
-You didn't do anything?

01:01:39.853 --> 01:01:42.242
-You didn't do anything?
-I didn't do anything.

01:01:42.453 --> 01:01:45.809
My wife is inviting you to Thanksgiving.
She thinks you're very charming.

01:01:45.973 --> 01:01:49.329
Do you have any idea where she
might have gotten that impression?

01:01:49.493 --> 01:01:52.451
-Huh? Look at me.
-No, sir.

01:01:52.613 --> 01:01:55.923
-Maybe she responds to nice people.
-Okay, nice people. Thanksgiving. . .

01:01:56.093 --> 01:02:00.530
. . .my house, my family, my dinner table.
1 400. Don't be late.

01:02:00.693 --> 01:02:03.253
-Yes, sir.
-Get out of here.

01:02:07.853 --> 01:02:11.368
It's nice out here.
How'd you find this place?

01:02:11.533 --> 01:02:14.172
It's a lighthouse, I'm a sailor.

01:02:14.333 --> 01:02:18.485
-It found me.
-You knucklehead.

01:02:18.653 --> 01:02:23.124
-You come out here a lot?
-Sometimes I come out here to think. . .

01:02:23.293 --> 01:02:26.126
. . .or to work out some problems.

01:02:26.893 --> 01:02:29.407
I know what you mean.

01:02:33.333 --> 01:02:34.846
Can I be honest with you?

01:02:36.333 --> 01:02:37.925
Yeah.

01:02:42.413 --> 01:02:46.929
Remember when I told you
that I was. . .

01:02:48.333 --> 01:02:51.166
. . .I was working on that important paper?

01:02:51.333 --> 01:02:53.483
Yeah.

01:02:53.813 --> 01:02:55.565
Well, I lied.

01:02:56.093 --> 01:02:58.607
-I know.
-You know?

01:02:59.013 --> 01:03:03.370
Yeah. You're seeing
a psychiatrist, aren't you?

01:03:04.333 --> 01:03:08.087
-You knew?
-It wasn't that hard to figure out.

01:03:09.373 --> 01:03:13.161
-You trying to tell me I'm crazy?
-No.

01:03:13.933 --> 01:03:16.049
So?

01:03:17.853 --> 01:03:22.369
So I understand if you don't want
to be bothered no more.

01:03:24.173 --> 01:03:26.368
You're not the only person
that's seen a shrink.

01:03:26.573 --> 01:03:28.768
-Are you seeing one?
-No.

01:03:28.933 --> 01:03:33.882
I told you, my dad's
a Vietnam vet. He has.

01:03:34.093 --> 01:03:36.732
I guess he made it, huh?

01:03:38.413 --> 01:03:42.406
So why are you seeing
a psychiatrist?

01:03:43.133 --> 01:03:46.523
My life before the Navy
was kind of complicated.

01:03:46.693 --> 01:03:50.083
-I was feeling ashamed.
-Of what?

01:03:51.293 --> 01:03:53.932
Of being unwanted.

01:03:55.413 --> 01:04:00.168
And, uh. . . .
I didn't have no parents.

01:04:03.093 --> 01:04:07.723
You know, I was afraid
to even approach you.

01:04:11.533 --> 01:04:16.687
Would you believe that
I was too shy to approach you?

01:04:18.293 --> 01:04:20.761
-No.
-Yeah.

01:04:21.533 --> 01:04:26.209
-Until I realized you were stalking me.
-I wasn't stalking you.

01:04:29.293 --> 01:04:35.243
Well, if there's anything
I can do to help, I'm here.

01:04:35.973 --> 01:04:39.568
-You're doing it already.
-What am I doing?

01:04:40.453 --> 01:04:42.523
Just being you.

01:04:53.573 --> 01:04:56.292
Happy Thanksgiving.

01:04:57.293 --> 01:04:59.523
Happy Thanksgiving.
Happy holidays, sir.

01:04:59.693 --> 01:05:03.891
Happy holidays, ma'am.
I know. . .

01:05:04.733 --> 01:05:07.042
. . .it's Berta.

01:05:07.213 --> 01:05:10.364
Yeah, come on in.

01:05:13.213 --> 01:05:16.250
Hello. I'm Antwone.

01:05:16.413 --> 01:05:20.201
I, uh. . . . Yeah, I'm hungry.

01:05:20.373 --> 01:05:22.841
I could eat.

01:05:24.773 --> 01:05:27.924
-1 400, huh? What took you so long?
-I stopped by to get some cider, sir.

01:05:28.093 --> 01:05:29.572
-Okay, good.
-Happy holidays.

01:05:29.733 --> 01:05:33.282
Thank you. Come on in.
We're about to say grace.

01:05:33.453 --> 01:05:36.684
All right, everybody. This is Antwone.
Antwone, this is my family.

01:05:36.853 --> 01:05:38.525
That's my mother, Johnny Mae.

01:05:38.733 --> 01:05:40.963
-That's my wife's brother, Uncle Duke.
-How you doing?

01:05:41.133 --> 01:05:44.045
-That's my dad, Howard. My sister Gwen.
-How are you?

01:05:44.213 --> 01:05:46.852
-And her full-grown daughter.
-Hi, Antwone.

01:05:47.013 --> 01:05:50.289
-You wanna come and sit next to her?
-Gwen, Gwen. . . .

01:05:50.453 --> 01:05:53.729
Come on, baby.
You can come on over here and sit.

01:05:56.053 --> 01:05:57.691
All right.

01:05:58.453 --> 01:06:03.129
-Duke, why don't you lead us in prayer.
-Okay. Everybody join hands.

01:06:03.613 --> 01:06:06.286
Let's bow our heads.

01:06:06.453 --> 01:06:11.129
Heavenly Father, we come to you
on bent knee and body bowed. . .

01:06:11.293 --> 01:06:13.488
. . .as humble as we know how.

01:06:13.653 --> 01:06:17.851
We are grateful for this opportunity
to share Thanksgiving as a family.

01:06:18.053 --> 01:06:20.487
We thank thee for our health,
Lord. . .

01:06:20.653 --> 01:06:24.532
. . .and for our friends,
who honor us with their presence.

01:06:24.773 --> 01:06:28.288
We also pray for peace in the world
and in our lives.

01:06:28.453 --> 01:06:30.728
-Amen.
-Amen.

01:06:30.933 --> 01:06:34.846
All right. Let's do it. Yeah.

01:06:44.933 --> 01:06:47.970
-There you go, Daddy.
-Thank you.

01:06:48.133 --> 01:06:51.045
-Honey, you want more turkey?
-No, thank you, ma'am.

01:06:51.213 --> 01:06:54.125
Don't you act all bashful around me.

01:06:54.293 --> 01:06:58.923
-Especially at the dinner table.
-Dad, leave that boy alone.

01:07:00.173 --> 01:07:04.689
-I'm okay.
-All right then, dig in. The food is free.

01:07:04.973 --> 01:07:06.292
Howard.

01:07:06.453 --> 01:07:09.365
You know, when I was in the service,
back in the war. . .

01:07:09.573 --> 01:07:12.724
-. . .that was before you were born.
-Howard.

01:07:12.893 --> 01:07:16.408
Anyway, I spent the holidays
in Europe on guard duty.

01:07:16.613 --> 01:07:19.969
I sure did miss my mama's
holiday cooking.

01:07:20.133 --> 01:07:24.126
-Howard, would you leave the boy alone?
-I ain't bothering him.

01:07:24.453 --> 01:07:27.126
-Leave me alone.
-Maybe he wants to eat.

01:07:27.293 --> 01:07:31.172
-I'm just talking to the boy.
-Give your daddy some greens.

01:07:31.733 --> 01:07:34.805
Listen, let me ask you something.
Where you from?

01:07:34.973 --> 01:07:38.010
-Cleveland.
-Cleveland. Yeah?

01:07:38.973 --> 01:07:43.046
I bet you miss your mama's
holiday cooking, don't you?

01:07:53.893 --> 01:07:55.212
Excuse me.

01:07:59.613 --> 01:08:03.606
-Where he going?
-I don't know.

01:08:03.893 --> 01:08:08.125
-That's what always happens.
-Why are you looking at me like that?

01:08:08.293 --> 01:08:12.172
-Why'd you do that to the boy?
-He ran the boy out of here.

01:08:12.333 --> 01:08:14.403
I didn't run the boy out.
I was trying to talk to him.

01:08:14.733 --> 01:08:18.930
-That's why I don't bring my friends.
-You okay?

01:08:19.093 --> 01:08:24.326
Yes. I'm okay. Just never had
a real Thanksgiving at the Tates' before.

01:08:24.533 --> 01:08:27.569
You didn't have a real one
here either, I guess.

01:08:27.773 --> 01:08:30.765
-No, you have a real nice family.
-Thank you.

01:08:31.212 --> 01:08:34.091
I got this for you,
for having me over today.

01:08:35.093 --> 01:08:38.448
-A gift for me? ls it money?
-No.

01:08:41.973 --> 01:08:46.251
It's a poem.
I can't see without my glasses.

01:08:46.412 --> 01:08:51.725
-Why don't you read it for me?
-I'd rather you read it. Please.

01:08:54.133 --> 01:09:00.049
Who will cry for the little boy
Lost and all alone

01:09:00.212 --> 01:09:05.492
Who will cry for the little boy
Abandoned without his own

01:09:05.653 --> 01:09:11.091
Who will cry for the little boy
He cried himself to sleep

01:09:11.252 --> 01:09:16.042
Who will cry for the little boy
Who he never had for keeps

01:09:16.212 --> 01:09:20.729
Who will cry for the little boy
Who walked the burning sand

01:09:20.893 --> 01:09:25.045
Who will cry for the little boy
The boy inside the man

01:09:25.212 --> 01:09:29.649
Who will cry for the little boy
Who knew well hurt and pain

01:09:29.813 --> 01:09:34.283
Who will cry for the little boy
Who died and died again

01:09:34.453 --> 01:09:37.604
Who will cry for the little boy

01:09:38.853 --> 01:09:40.923
A good boy he tried to be

01:09:41.173 --> 01:09:46.372
Who will cry for the little boy
Who cries inside of me

01:09:47.372 --> 01:09:52.082
-Who will cry for the little boy, Antwone?
-I will.

01:09:53.372 --> 01:09:55.887
I always do.

01:10:08.853 --> 01:10:11.811
-It's beautiful, Antwone.
-I know. I told you I was good.

01:10:11.973 --> 01:10:14.726
Yes, you are. You are good
because you're honest.

01:10:14.893 --> 01:10:17.851
More honest than most people,
even in your anger.

01:10:18.053 --> 01:10:22.365
The only thing you're not honest about
is your need to find your own family.

01:10:22.653 --> 01:10:26.362
-Your natural family.
-I don't feel like I need to look for them.

01:10:26.533 --> 01:10:30.685
-It'd answer a lot of questions for you.
-I don't have any questions.

01:10:31.613 --> 01:10:35.572
You're upset with them because
they didn't come to your rescue.

01:10:35.733 --> 01:10:37.724
-Maybe they didn't know.
-How could they not know?

01:10:37.893 --> 01:10:40.407
That's the question you need
to ask them.

01:10:40.573 --> 01:10:43.645
"Regard without ill will
despite an offense. "

01:10:43.813 --> 01:10:45.769
That's Webster's definition
of forgiveness.

01:10:45.973 --> 01:10:49.045
-Why do I have to forgive?
-To free yourself.

01:10:49.733 --> 01:10:53.203
So that you can get on with your life.

01:10:56.813 --> 01:11:00.169
Why do I gotta go look for my family?
I got you, doc.

01:11:14.213 --> 01:11:16.932
I think that he had a good time tonight.

01:11:17.093 --> 01:11:20.324
Antwone. I think that he had
a good time, don't you?

01:11:20.533 --> 01:11:21.761
Yeah, it seemed like it.

01:11:21.933 --> 01:11:28.372
He did the sweetest thing at the door
when he was saying goodbye.

01:11:28.533 --> 01:11:32.048
He invited me to come to his ceremony.

01:11:32.213 --> 01:11:35.046
-He's graduating from his Japanese class.
-Yeah, I know.

01:11:35.213 --> 01:11:39.923
-He wants me to come. To be with you.
-What did you tell him?

01:11:40.093 --> 01:11:43.768
I told him that I would be honored,
Jerome.

01:11:44.893 --> 01:11:46.690
Okay.

01:11:51.173 --> 01:11:52.162
Okay.

01:11:55.613 --> 01:11:58.081
Congratulations.

01:11:58.253 --> 01:12:01.689
-Petty Officer Fisher. Good job.
-Thank you, commander.

01:12:01.853 --> 01:12:04.686
I was waiting. Cheryl, right?
It's a pleasure to meet you.

01:12:04.893 --> 01:12:06.451
-Thank you.
-Heard good things about you.

01:12:06.613 --> 01:12:09.081
-Where's your wife?
-She couldn't make it.

01:12:09.253 --> 01:12:12.086
Sends along her congratulations.
A small gift for you.

01:12:12.893 --> 01:12:16.966
Okay. The Philosophy
and Opinions of Marcus Garvey.

01:12:17.133 --> 01:12:19.010
-Thank you, sir.
-You're welcome.

01:12:19.173 --> 01:12:22.085
Is there somewhere
we can talk in private?

01:12:22.253 --> 01:12:24.926
-Do you mind?
-That's fine. I don't mind.

01:12:25.093 --> 01:12:27.687
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you, sir.

01:12:31.213 --> 01:12:33.443
Hello?

01:12:33.893 --> 01:12:35.849
What's up, doc?

01:12:36.013 --> 01:12:38.686
-How are you?
-I'm good.

01:12:38.853 --> 01:12:41.492
Yes, you are, Antwone.
You're good.

01:12:41.653 --> 01:12:44.725
I've heard nothing
but good things from your CO.

01:12:44.893 --> 01:12:48.329
You're getting along very well
with your shipmates. I'm proud of you.

01:12:48.493 --> 01:12:51.053
Thank you, sir.

01:12:51.213 --> 01:12:53.681
Have you thought any more
about finding your family?

01:12:53.853 --> 01:12:55.491
I don't know. For what?

01:12:55.653 --> 01:12:59.123
I just think that there's nothing
more important than that, Antwone.

01:12:59.533 --> 01:13:01.683
What are you trying to say, sir?

01:13:03.053 --> 01:13:07.046
That I'm proud of you.
That I think you've come a long way.

01:13:07.213 --> 01:13:10.888
Okay. You said that.
What's wrong?

01:13:12.093 --> 01:13:14.687
There's nothing wrong.

01:13:16.533 --> 01:13:19.331
You understand,
this is very difficult for me.

01:13:21.573 --> 01:13:26.203
Our sessions have ended.
Now listen. Just listen to me.

01:13:26.893 --> 01:13:31.489
-What do you mean they've ended?
-It's time for you to move on.

01:13:31.693 --> 01:13:34.924
-We're working out my problems.
-We can't work them out anymore.

01:13:35.093 --> 01:13:36.811
-Listen to me--
-Get off me!

01:13:36.973 --> 01:13:38.691
Get out. Get out!

01:13:38.853 --> 01:13:42.004
-Everybody's always leaving me.
-People grow. People move on.

01:13:42.173 --> 01:13:43.891
You've grown. It's time for you
to move on.

01:13:44.053 --> 01:13:47.443
My mother left me, my father.
Jesse. And you.

01:13:47.613 --> 01:13:51.162
-Jesse? What do you mean?
-We should've never gone, that's what.

01:13:51.333 --> 01:13:53.767
There's cow bells ringing in my--
Fucking head.

01:13:53.933 --> 01:13:59.451
-Cow bells? Tell me about the cow bells.
-Nothing! Can't trust. . . .

01:14:00.893 --> 01:14:03.248
What happened to Jesse, Antwone?

01:14:03.413 --> 01:14:09.045
Stay away from me. Nobody's taking
anything else away from me no more.

01:14:25.053 --> 01:14:27.328
Who is it?

01:14:29.053 --> 01:14:34.491
I just asked who it was at the--
Fish! What's up, dog?

01:14:34.653 --> 01:14:38.441
-What's up with you, man?
-Chill. Stop playing.

01:14:38.613 --> 01:14:42.686
What do you mean, stop playing?
Don't make me kick your ass, man.

01:14:42.853 --> 01:14:45.162
-What's up with you?
-What's up with you?

01:14:45.333 --> 01:14:49.611
Where you been at?
Where you staying? What's up?

01:14:52.653 --> 01:14:56.248
I'm at the men's shelter.
Up on Prospect.

01:14:56.413 --> 01:15:00.565
-Where you staying at? For real.
-I'm on the street.

01:15:00.773 --> 01:15:03.492
-What you doing on the street?
-I got nowhere to go.

01:15:03.653 --> 01:15:06.565
You ain't got nowhere to go?
You couldn't come to my house?

01:15:06.773 --> 01:15:09.128
No. Your mom ain't gonna let me
stay up in here.

01:15:09.293 --> 01:15:12.922
You're tripping. She ain't gotta know.
She work all day, sleep all night.

01:15:13.093 --> 01:15:17.325
Besides, there's so many people here,
she wouldn't know you were here.

01:15:17.493 --> 01:15:19.529
You can stay here. For real.

01:15:19.693 --> 01:15:23.925
-You got something in the refrigerator?
-Yeah, we got something. . . .

01:15:24.853 --> 01:15:26.047
-You hungry?
-I'm hungry.

01:15:26.213 --> 01:15:29.649
-You hungry?
-Yeah, man. Stop playing.

01:15:29.813 --> 01:15:33.408
Smell like you've been
on the streets too, man.

01:15:35.173 --> 01:15:39.371
Slow down, man.
Ain't nobody gonna take your food.

01:15:39.573 --> 01:15:42.212
Remember when Mrs. Tate
wouldn't let you use her lotion?

01:15:42.373 --> 01:15:44.329
She made you oil up
in old cooking grease.

01:15:44.493 --> 01:15:47.849
You smelled like a fried chicken dinner.
You like:

01:15:48.013 --> 01:15:52.450
"I sure is hungry! "
That was so funny. Had me rolling.

01:15:52.613 --> 01:15:55.889
Not as funny as your mother
chasing you with that brick.

01:15:56.053 --> 01:15:58.283
-You remember that? That was funny.
-I remember.

01:15:58.453 --> 01:16:03.163
Dude, that wasn't funny.
I still got a knot on the back of my head.

01:16:04.053 --> 01:16:08.126
-You know you're my best friend, right?
-What you want?

01:16:08.333 --> 01:16:10.369
I can't be happy my dude
back on the block?

01:16:10.533 --> 01:16:13.445
I can't be happy you're back home, man?

01:16:14.173 --> 01:16:16.733
-I want you to do something for me.
-What?

01:16:16.893 --> 01:16:19.726
-Look out for me.
-Is somebody after you?

01:16:19.893 --> 01:16:25.047
Why somebody gotta be after me?
I just want you to look out for me.

01:16:25.213 --> 01:16:27.602
-All right.
-You're my best friend, right?

01:16:27.773 --> 01:16:31.732
-Yeah. Stop tripping, man.
-Let's get you cleaned up, hit the streets.

01:16:32.253 --> 01:16:35.211
You know, Brenda I used to like?

01:16:35.373 --> 01:16:38.410
Brenda you used to like
has got about three kids now.

01:16:38.573 --> 01:16:41.406
She's all swole.
She's big. For real, dog.

01:16:41.573 --> 01:16:44.929
-Ain't little-booty Brenda anymore.
-How's your mama?

01:16:45.093 --> 01:16:49.530
Man, she got knocked up.

01:16:57.733 --> 01:17:01.089
Go ahead and get something.
I got you.

01:17:12.933 --> 01:17:14.491
-Break it off, old man!
-What you doing?!

01:17:14.653 --> 01:17:18.362
This ain't no riddle! Ain't nothing
to figure out. Hold up, Fish.

01:17:18.573 --> 01:17:21.212
You better break off my loot.
Look out for me, Fish.

01:18:01.133 --> 01:18:03.931
By the end of the next day,
I was in boot camp.

01:18:04.093 --> 01:18:06.653
I always felt like Jesse
was the lucky one.

01:18:06.813 --> 01:18:10.283
-I envied him for it.
-How could he be lucky? He's dead.

01:18:10.493 --> 01:18:14.042
Well, he left me and he knew
he was the only one I had.

01:18:14.933 --> 01:18:18.005
So you're angry at him
because you felt he abandoned you?

01:18:18.173 --> 01:18:20.812
Yes. A little bit.

01:18:21.933 --> 01:18:26.211
-How is he the lucky one?
-He don't have to fight no more.

01:18:26.693 --> 01:18:28.684
Neither do you.

01:18:29.853 --> 01:18:32.208
-So you think I'll make it?
-I think you already have.

01:18:32.693 --> 01:18:35.048
What do you think?

01:18:35.213 --> 01:18:39.445
I think maybe in another life or time. . .

01:18:39.613 --> 01:18:41.683
. . .I would have been king.

01:19:00.653 --> 01:19:05.647
When you locate your family,
I want you to contact me.

01:19:05.813 --> 01:19:09.123
All right? I wanna hear all about it.

01:19:10.973 --> 01:19:13.009
Yes, sir.

01:19:16.053 --> 01:19:18.806
I love you, son.

01:19:21.213 --> 01:19:23.932
I love you too.

01:19:55.773 --> 01:19:58.651
-Who's this?
-Guess who.

01:19:59.853 --> 01:20:03.562
No, this is Philip Walker,
the late-night stalker.

01:20:06.253 --> 01:20:08.403
What's up?

01:20:09.453 --> 01:20:12.763
I'm going on leave.

01:20:13.253 --> 01:20:16.051
-When?
-As soon as you put your request in. . .

01:20:16.213 --> 01:20:18.408
. . .and come with me.

01:20:18.573 --> 01:20:21.292
-You serious?
-Yes.

01:20:22.733 --> 01:20:26.726
I just came back. They're not gonna
let me leave again this year.

01:20:26.893 --> 01:20:29.612
Can you ask for emergency leave?

01:20:29.773 --> 01:20:33.846
Tell them somebody close to you
is in desperate need.

01:20:34.413 --> 01:20:37.803
Cheryl, I really want you
to come with me.

01:20:39.133 --> 01:20:43.524
Even got these two open tickets.

01:20:44.733 --> 01:20:47.201
To Cleveland?

01:20:47.373 --> 01:20:51.082
-You're gonna try and find them?
-Yeah. I need to find them.

01:20:52.373 --> 01:20:54.887
But not without your help.

01:20:56.133 --> 01:20:58.488
All right. Let me see what I can do.

01:21:12.373 --> 01:21:16.002
First the light-skinned girls,
they got adopted the quickest.

01:21:16.173 --> 01:21:19.404
Then the light-skinned boys,
then the dark-skinned girls...

01:21:19.573 --> 01:21:22.804
...and then, last but not least,
the dark-skinned boys.

01:21:22.973 --> 01:21:29.321
I'm sorry. All birth records since 1 980
have been moved to Social Services.

01:21:46.413 --> 01:21:49.564
Last contact with your mother?

01:21:50.933 --> 01:21:53.527
I was 2 months old.

01:21:53.693 --> 01:21:57.572
-And with father?
-Never.

01:21:58.253 --> 01:22:00.369
Place of birth?

01:22:00.533 --> 01:22:04.492
Ohio State Correctional Facility
for Women.

01:22:07.293 --> 01:22:10.091
I'll be right back.

01:22:35.893 --> 01:22:39.169
I need you to sign for me.

01:22:42.573 --> 01:22:45.246
-Best of luck, Mr. Fisher.
-Thank you.

01:23:01.653 --> 01:23:04.213
There's nothing in here.

01:23:18.093 --> 01:23:19.924
Why don't you go see
your foster mother?

01:23:20.093 --> 01:23:22.561
Who, Mrs. Tate? I'm not. . . .

01:23:22.733 --> 01:23:25.042
I'm not going back.

01:23:26.053 --> 01:23:30.285
Why not? She might know
something about your family.

01:24:26.213 --> 01:24:29.205
I've never done this before.

01:26:03.693 --> 01:26:05.126
Take a ride with me.

01:26:55.853 --> 01:26:59.562
If you're selling shit,
just keep on walking.

01:27:00.973 --> 01:27:03.487
My God! ls that you, Antwone?
Come here, baby.

01:27:03.653 --> 01:27:05.291
Don't touch me.

01:27:05.453 --> 01:27:08.490
Yeah, it's me. And I'm all grown up.

01:27:09.973 --> 01:27:13.443
I'd like to speak to Mrs. Tate.

01:27:13.613 --> 01:27:16.207
-You wanna come in?
-No.

01:27:16.413 --> 01:27:17.892
Would you like to get her?

01:27:24.293 --> 01:27:27.524
-Antwone's here.
-Lord, have mercy.

01:27:27.693 --> 01:27:32.369
Where's the child?
Nigger, hug me--

01:27:38.413 --> 01:27:40.165
Nigger. . . .

01:27:41.213 --> 01:27:43.727
Don't you know how to come home?
Where you been?

01:27:43.933 --> 01:27:45.764
I came for one thing:

01:27:45.933 --> 01:27:49.926
Whatever you can tell me
about my real family.

01:27:50.253 --> 01:27:55.486
-I don't know nothing about your people.
-A name, a number, anything?

01:27:55.653 --> 01:27:58.725
I said, I don't know.
Now come along. Come on.

01:27:58.893 --> 01:28:01.453
I remember everything.

01:28:01.613 --> 01:28:03.331
Everything.

01:28:03.493 --> 01:28:07.168
You could have helped me,
but instead you beat me. And you?

01:28:07.573 --> 01:28:10.371
-I don't know what you talking about?
-Yes, you do! I was 6!

01:28:10.573 --> 01:28:12.643
-Now you listen--
-No, you listen to me.

01:28:12.853 --> 01:28:15.890
-I think you've forgotten--
-I said, listen to me.

01:28:16.053 --> 01:28:20.490
This is my time.
You understand me?

01:28:21.733 --> 01:28:24.167
It don't matter. . .

01:28:24.333 --> 01:28:27.484
. . .what you tried to do.
You couldn't destroy me.

01:28:27.653 --> 01:28:31.441
I'm still standing. I'm still strong.

01:28:35.253 --> 01:28:38.290
And I always will be.

01:29:07.813 --> 01:29:09.769
Elkins.

01:29:11.773 --> 01:29:16.005
Your father's name
was Edward Elkins.

01:29:27.813 --> 01:29:33.490
Take Shaker Heights and East Cleveland.
I'm gonna take Akron and Cleveland.

01:29:35.493 --> 01:29:39.042
Yeah. 1 976.

01:29:39.213 --> 01:29:44.606
Hello, I'm looking for the family
of Edward Elkins.

01:29:45.573 --> 01:29:47.848
Edward Elkins.

01:29:56.973 --> 01:30:01.967
-I'm looking for family of Edward Elkins.
-Ma'am? No, Edward.

01:30:02.133 --> 01:30:07.366
-E-D-W-A-R-D.
-Yes, Edward.

01:30:07.533 --> 01:30:12.891
-What? I'm speaking clearly, you can't--?
-Okay. Thank you.

01:30:13.053 --> 01:30:16.489
I'm looking for the family
of an Edward Elkins.

01:30:16.653 --> 01:30:21.363
You should have said that
in the first place. Why you. . .?

01:30:35.813 --> 01:30:39.408
Yeah. We're from California.

01:30:39.573 --> 01:30:42.610
Yes, it's very nice there.

01:30:42.893 --> 01:30:47.762
Okay. Thank you for your help, ma'am.
Thank you. Bye.

01:30:47.933 --> 01:30:50.288
Any luck?

01:30:51.373 --> 01:30:55.207
-What you got?
-Chinese.

01:31:10.573 --> 01:31:13.531
-Hello?
-Hello, ma 'am?

01:31:13.693 --> 01:31:17.925
I'm looking for the family
of an Edward Elkins.

01:31:19.053 --> 01:31:22.170
Edward?
Who's this calling about Edward?

01:31:22.653 --> 01:31:27.602
My name is Antwone Fisher.
I'm trying to locate my family.

01:31:28.653 --> 01:31:33.443
-Honey, Edward's been dead a long time.
-Yes, ma 'am, I know.

01:31:33.653 --> 01:31:36.087
A long time. He was my father.

01:31:40.813 --> 01:31:45.045
Wait, wait. Who is this
calling me up out of nowhere?

01:31:45.213 --> 01:31:48.205
-How'd you get this number?
-Out of the phone book.

01:31:49.133 --> 01:31:53.809
I've been calling Elkins all day.
I have no reason to lie to you, ma'am.

01:31:53.973 --> 01:31:57.283
Edward never mentioned no. . . .
What's your name again?

01:31:57.453 --> 01:32:00.411
-Antwone.
-Antwone.

01:32:00.573 --> 01:32:03.770
I don't think he knew my mother
was pregnant. She was away in prison.

01:32:05.413 --> 01:32:07.688
-You know how he died?
-Yes, ma 'am.

01:32:08.133 --> 01:32:11.205
He was murdered
by one of his girlfriends.

01:32:11.373 --> 01:32:14.968
Oh, my God. Wait.

01:32:15.133 --> 01:32:20.253
What made you decide to show up
20 years later in the middle of the night?

01:32:20.933 --> 01:32:24.892
It's a long story.
But I'm in the Navy. . .

01:32:25.053 --> 01:32:28.045
. . .and I'm stationed on the West Coast.
I gotta get back soon.

01:32:28.253 --> 01:32:31.484
-Come by my house before you go.
-Okay.

01:32:31.653 --> 01:32:36.852
Okay, look, you have a pencil?
Take down my address.

01:32:37.053 --> 01:32:40.807
It's 1 089 Drexel.

01:32:41.013 --> 01:32:42.446
1 089 Drexel.

01:32:42.613 --> 01:32:44.285
-You know where that is?
-Yes, ma'am.

01:32:44.493 --> 01:32:48.691
-Come by my house tomorrow, hear?
-Okay. Ma 'am?

01:32:49.253 --> 01:32:53.451
-You mind if I bring my girlfriend?
-I look forward to meeting her.

01:32:53.613 --> 01:32:57.925
-I'm sure she is too.
-Listen, you know. . .

01:32:58.093 --> 01:33:02.609
. . .if Edward was your father,
then you're talking to your auntie, son.

01:33:02.773 --> 01:33:08.484
You are talking to your auntie Annette,
your daddy's baby sister.

01:33:08.813 --> 01:33:11.486
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-I'll see you tomorrow.

01:33:11.653 --> 01:33:13.769
-Good night.
-Bye.

01:33:38.973 --> 01:33:41.726
I found them.

01:33:43.173 --> 01:33:47.086
-I found my family.
-You did?

01:33:48.013 --> 01:33:50.573
Oh, baby.

01:34:02.693 --> 01:34:07.084
-I don't know. What do you think?
-He does look like Eddie.

01:34:07.293 --> 01:34:11.081
-I do?
-Yeah, you look just like him.

01:34:14.493 --> 01:34:17.007
I brought my birth certificate.

01:34:24.013 --> 01:34:27.244
Born '76. That's the year Edward died.

01:34:27.453 --> 01:34:32.163
Yeah. He died in June,
and I was born in August.

01:34:32.333 --> 01:34:35.689
-And your mother's name is Eva. . .?
-Eva Mae Fisher.

01:34:37.973 --> 01:34:39.964
I know Eva. That's Jess' sister.

01:34:40.613 --> 01:34:42.285
-Who?
-Jess.

01:34:42.453 --> 01:34:45.126
-You mean Fish?
-Yeah, Fish. Jess Fisher.

01:34:45.333 --> 01:34:49.246
The boy's name is Antwone Fisher.
That's Jess' sister, Eva Mae.

01:34:49.413 --> 01:34:55.045
-Mae-Mae. She lives on Hodges Street.
-I don't remember no Mae-Mae.

01:34:56.053 --> 01:34:58.886
You know where she lives?

01:35:00.693 --> 01:35:03.651
You don't know her, do you?

01:35:07.213 --> 01:35:10.603
No, l. . . .
No, no.

01:35:10.813 --> 01:35:13.247
Do you wanna meet her?

01:35:21.493 --> 01:35:24.803
Yeah. Yeah.

01:35:25.013 --> 01:35:29.325
Are you sure? Because we can
take care of this right here and now.

01:35:31.053 --> 01:35:33.487
Yeah, I'm sure.

01:35:34.053 --> 01:35:36.442
Let me get my hat.

01:35:42.773 --> 01:35:45.367
You want me to go with you?

01:35:46.213 --> 01:35:48.727
No, why don't you just stay here
with us, baby?

01:35:48.893 --> 01:35:50.804
Okay, let's ride.

01:35:58.813 --> 01:36:00.371
Bye.

01:36:30.093 --> 01:36:32.846
You aren't gonna let nothing
happen to me, are you?

01:36:33.013 --> 01:36:37.052
No, Antwone. I'm not gonna let
nothing happen to you.

01:37:12.773 --> 01:37:17.927
-Who is it?
-It's James Elkins, Edward's brother.

01:37:20.613 --> 01:37:23.810
Did you hear me, Eva? It's James.

01:37:24.413 --> 01:37:28.167
-What you want?
-Can we come in?

01:37:41.293 --> 01:37:44.205
-Hey, Eva.
-Hey.

01:37:45.733 --> 01:37:48.486
It's all right, son. Come on.

01:37:53.213 --> 01:37:55.647
Who's that, Eva?

01:37:56.053 --> 01:37:58.521
-That's Johnny.
-No. . .

01:37:58.693 --> 01:38:02.049
. . .that's Antwone Quenton Fisher.

01:38:12.573 --> 01:38:15.292
Who's Antwone Quenton Fisher, Eva?

01:38:19.453 --> 01:38:22.525
That's my first-born son.

01:38:34.613 --> 01:38:37.685
There's nothing going on around here.

01:38:38.413 --> 01:38:42.964
-You wanna stay?
-I wanna stay.

01:38:43.493 --> 01:38:46.053
I'll be in the car.

01:39:25.173 --> 01:39:28.006
-You want something to eat?
-No.

01:39:31.893 --> 01:39:34.805
Why'd you never come for me?

01:39:37.933 --> 01:39:40.811
Didn't you wonder where I was?

01:39:40.973 --> 01:39:45.012
Or what I was doing?
Or what I've become?

01:39:46.733 --> 01:39:49.167
Even if I was still alive?

01:39:50.133 --> 01:39:52.044
Didn't you?

01:40:09.413 --> 01:40:12.723
I've taken care of myself.
I have.

01:40:13.813 --> 01:40:17.328
I've never been in trouble
with the law.

01:40:18.453 --> 01:40:21.331
I've read hundreds of books. . .

01:40:21.493 --> 01:40:26.123
. . .written poems, painted pictures.

01:40:26.293 --> 01:40:29.046
I've traveled the world.

01:40:29.493 --> 01:40:31.529
I serve my country.

01:40:32.373 --> 01:40:34.841
I speak two languages.

01:40:35.893 --> 01:40:39.090
And I'm working on a third.

01:40:40.493 --> 01:40:43.007
I never fathered any children.

01:40:43.173 --> 01:40:46.529
I've never done drugs
or even smoked a cigarette.

01:41:04.093 --> 01:41:07.165
I used to dream about you.

01:41:08.973 --> 01:41:11.282
My mother.

01:41:11.453 --> 01:41:15.844
My mother, you know,
what you'd be like.

01:41:17.613 --> 01:41:22.243
How you'd look.
Your voice and your smile.

01:41:22.413 --> 01:41:24.608
Even your scent.

01:41:27.173 --> 01:41:31.007
For all these years,
I wondered about you.

01:41:31.533 --> 01:41:36.209
I dreamed about you.
Didn't you miss me?

01:41:38.893 --> 01:41:41.532
On the way to school each day. . .

01:41:41.693 --> 01:41:45.652
. . .I imagined you were
just around the next corner.

01:41:45.813 --> 01:41:50.489
And when I'd get there,
you'd be there.

01:41:50.893 --> 01:41:53.248
And in my mind. . .

01:41:54.053 --> 01:41:56.567
. . .you was always there.

01:41:56.733 --> 01:41:58.325
You just couldn't find me.

01:41:59.733 --> 01:42:03.442
So I'd race to the next corner. . .

01:42:03.613 --> 01:42:07.765
. . .and you'd be there.
I knew you would.

01:42:07.933 --> 01:42:10.242
Then you would. . .

01:42:10.413 --> 01:42:12.973
. . .buy me ice cream.

01:42:14.733 --> 01:42:17.293
And then you would take me home.

01:42:33.293 --> 01:42:35.807
I'm a good person.

01:42:36.973 --> 01:42:39.533
I'm a good man.

01:43:36.893 --> 01:43:41.808
-How you doing? I'm your uncle Horace.
-Out of the way, Horace. Come on, baby.

01:43:42.013 --> 01:43:45.642
-Here he is.
-Look at you. I'm your aunt Eda, baby.

01:43:45.813 --> 01:43:50.329
Me, me! I'm your cousin Jeanette.
Welcome home.

01:43:50.493 --> 01:43:53.451
And I'm your aunt Anna.
How you doing, baby?

01:43:59.453 --> 01:44:01.808
-This is my wife, T.
-How you doing, good-looking?

01:44:01.973 --> 01:44:04.646
I'm your cousin Eddie.
I'm named after your father.

01:44:04.813 --> 01:44:07.452
-This is my brother Ray.
-What's up, dog?

01:44:07.613 --> 01:44:10.923
I'm your cousin Jason, man.
Much love, much love.

01:44:11.293 --> 01:44:13.966
All right, boys. Open up.

01:45:35.253 --> 01:45:38.131
Welcome.

01:45:46.133 --> 01:45:49.762
-All right.
-Come on, let's eat!

01:45:52.293 --> 01:45:57.003
Hey, you want some pancakes?

01:46:01.973 --> 01:46:04.362
There we go.
How about some sausages?

01:46:29.933 --> 01:46:33.084
I'm not a virgin anymore.

01:46:36.693 --> 01:46:39.332
I'm glad to hear that.

01:46:45.693 --> 01:46:47.649
-How you doing, son?
-I'm great, sir.

01:46:47.813 --> 01:46:51.328
Good. Good. Very good to see you.
So?

01:46:51.493 --> 01:46:55.771
I took your advice. I found my family.
And I found my mother.

01:46:57.093 --> 01:47:00.085
Good. So?

01:47:00.253 --> 01:47:04.485
In my heart, I forgive her.
But if I never saw her again. . . .

01:47:05.333 --> 01:47:06.766
I understand.

01:47:06.933 --> 01:47:09.652
It's funny to feel that way
about your mother.

01:47:09.813 --> 01:47:13.408
But I did it and I owe it to you
to tell you that you were right.

01:47:13.653 --> 01:47:17.043
-You owe it to me?
-Yes, sir. I needed to find her.

01:47:19.973 --> 01:47:23.886
If I was right,
it was for all the wrong reasons.

01:47:24.573 --> 01:47:28.282
-This stays between you and me, okay?
-Yes, sir.

01:47:28.453 --> 01:47:32.685
My wife and I were gonna have kids
and found out we couldn't have any.

01:47:32.933 --> 01:47:35.003
It rocked her to the core.

01:47:35.173 --> 01:47:39.246
I knew what to do for her, though.
She needed help. Treatment.

01:47:39.413 --> 01:47:43.406
I made sure she had it. The best
psychiatrist, the one who trained me.

01:47:43.573 --> 01:47:47.202
But l, the well one, the strong one. . .

01:47:47.373 --> 01:47:51.844
. . .at the same time, I went about
the business of shutting down.

01:47:52.013 --> 01:47:56.484
Very subtle, very quiet.
It was my little secret.

01:47:56.693 --> 01:48:01.403
Until one day a young man
came into my office and my life. . .

01:48:01.573 --> 01:48:04.645
. . .and he blew up that little secret.
Right in my face.

01:48:04.813 --> 01:48:09.933
And he put me to shame
in a way I never thought possible.

01:48:11.173 --> 01:48:15.325
Because of you, Antwone,
I'm a better doctor. . .

01:48:16.133 --> 01:48:19.762
. . .and I'm learning
to be a better husband.

01:48:20.653 --> 01:48:23.770
You don't owe me anything.
I owe you.

01:48:24.533 --> 01:48:28.412
You're the champ, son. You've beaten
everybody who was beating you.

01:48:29.693 --> 01:48:31.809
I salute you.

01:48:37.493 --> 01:48:40.485
-You hungry, sailor?
-I could eat, sir.

01:48:43.133 --> 01:48:45.169
Well, let's go.
