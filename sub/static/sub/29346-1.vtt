<i>Hi. This is Diane Gies.</i>

00:33.501 --> 00:36.168
<i>I'm not here right now,
so you know what to do.</i>

00:36.170 --> 00:40.305
<i>Hey, I'm trying to get hold of you guys.
You're not picking up. Um,</i>

00:40.307 --> 00:42.107
<i>so I missed my flight.</i>

00:42.109 --> 00:44.810
<i>- Eddie? This isn't a good time.
- Yeah. What?</i>

00:44.812 --> 00:47.479
<i>- Can I call you back?
- I know, but I'm at the counter, Diane.</i>

00:47.481 --> 00:50.749
<i>I need...</i> I'll call you back.

00:50.751 --> 00:53.252
<i>What the fuck is going on?
Why are you here?</i>

00:53.254 --> 00:55.721
<i>Why don't you just let me talk, okay?
I'm at the airport.</i>

00:55.723 --> 00:56.393
<i>Missed my plane.</i>

00:56.405 --> 00:58.223
<i>Great, that's your
problem, Eddie, not mine.</i>

00:58.225 --> 01:00.392
<i>That is a...</i>

01:00.394 --> 01:02.561
- <i>Doctor's in the room.
- Hey, Zak, how's he doing?</i>

01:02.563 --> 01:06.265
<i>Not great this morning.
He had a bad night.</i>

01:06.267 --> 01:08.534
<i>- Listen, I need your Visa...
- Where you at?</i>

01:08.536 --> 01:10.436
<i>I need your Visa
number, like, right now.</i>

01:10.438 --> 01:12.471
<i>No, problem, buddy.
I've been there.</i>

01:12.473 --> 01:14.139
<i>- Yeah.
- Oh, shit. Something's happening.</i>

01:14.141 --> 01:15.707
<i>- Yeah. No, don't talk...
- What?</i>

01:15.709 --> 01:18.210
<i>- To Andy about it.
- No, I'm not talking to Andy.</i>

01:18.212 --> 01:20.579
<i>- He'd lay it into me.
- But why didn't he give you the...</i>

01:20.581 --> 01:22.064
<i>Yes, don't talk to him about it.
Just leave.</i>

01:22.076 --> 01:22.681
<i>I'm handling it.</i>

01:22.683 --> 01:25.484
<i>Hey, buddy, I'm back. OK.
I'm texting my Visa right now.</i>

01:25.486 --> 01:30.189
<i>Okay, good, thank you.
And don't forget your, um, security code.</i>

02:12.233 --> 02:13.765
Should we start?
I think we should start.

02:13.767 --> 02:15.234
Yeah, who is that guy?

02:15.236 --> 02:16.602
I thought we were getting
a bagpipe player

02:16.604 --> 02:18.237
I thought... but he's
playing a flute.

02:18.239 --> 02:19.771
I mean, that's not
even a real flute,

02:19.773 --> 02:21.440
That's like a frickin'
Native American thing.

02:21.442 --> 02:23.342
Who is this guy?
Do you know him?

02:23.344 --> 02:25.277
That's Tom Running-cloud.
I went to high school with him.

02:25.279 --> 02:26.879
I haven't seen him in 30 years.

02:26.881 --> 02:28.847
I did not invite him,
I wouldn't do this.

02:28.849 --> 02:30.658
It's a Pan flute, OK?
I'll take care of it.

02:30.670 --> 02:31.383
Why is he here?

02:31.385 --> 02:34.286
Hey, Tom? Tom, you mind?

02:34.288 --> 02:38.490
W-We're honored.
Thank you, sir, but we're good. Thank you.

02:40.227 --> 02:42.227
- He's not stopping.
- He's not stopping.

02:42.229 --> 02:43.795
- OK. Go get him. Go.
- Oh, my God.

02:43.797 --> 02:46.498
- He's not stopping.
- Hey, Tom. Tom, friend.

02:46.500 --> 02:49.434
- Dad would have loved a bagpiper.
- Yeah. Yeah.

02:54.475 --> 02:57.910
Give us your poor, your
tired, your huddled masses

02:57.912 --> 03:00.612
yearning to be free,
your Mexicans

03:00.614 --> 03:04.249
yearning for handouts
and entitlements

03:04.251 --> 03:07.352
and free food and bus passes.

03:07.354 --> 03:09.588
I can't stop him. You stop him.

03:09.590 --> 03:13.625
- Mexicans. Mexicans, God bless us.
- Dad. Dad, stop it.

03:13.627 --> 03:16.929
I say put hinges
on that goddamn wall.

03:16.931 --> 03:21.733
Dad. The Diegos live next door.
OK? You're being offensive.

03:21.735 --> 03:23.569
Half of them are undocumented.

03:23.571 --> 03:26.405
Papers.<i> Documentos.</i>
Pay,<i> por favor.</i>

03:26.407 --> 03:27.940
You are a racist son of a bitch.

03:27.942 --> 03:30.442
I am, I am,
and I need another drink.

03:30.444 --> 03:31.132
Great.

03:31.144 --> 03:33.245
Well, we seem to have
silenced the neighborhood.

03:33.247 --> 03:35.214
Happy Fourth of July.

03:41.288 --> 03:42.588
Everyone ready?

03:43.424 --> 03:44.756
- Sure.
- How do I look?

03:44.758 --> 03:47.359
- You look great.
- Great. You look good.

03:47.361 --> 03:50.562
I don't remember what I'm supposed to do.
I'm just... I'm very...

03:50.564 --> 03:53.298
I'm very nervous,
and I can't stop shaking.

03:53.300 --> 03:54.866
What we do, we wait for
the music to start.

03:54.868 --> 03:58.403
Then we walk down the aisle,
and then Eddie gives the eulogy.

03:58.405 --> 04:00.239
Eddie? I'm sorry.
I thought it was Andy.

04:00.241 --> 04:02.407
- Oh, I was ready to, but...
- No.

04:02.409 --> 04:04.943
Bob wanted Eddie
to do the eulogy.

04:04.945 --> 04:08.313
- Edward, you will do the eulogy.
- Yes.

04:09.283 --> 04:11.250
I'll keep it short and sweet.

04:13.520 --> 04:14.720
You all right?

04:16.257 --> 04:18.624
Welcome to this celebration

04:18.625 --> 04:20.759
of the joining
of Robert Joseph Mills

04:20.761 --> 04:22.928
with our lord, our God.

04:22.930 --> 04:25.931
Edward has some thoughts he'd like to
share with us before the Mass begins.

04:25.933 --> 04:28.600
If you're not Catholic,
feel free to come up during Communion.

04:28.602 --> 04:32.638
Just please cross your arms,
and you can receive a blessing.

04:32.640 --> 04:35.674
However, do not partake
in the sacrament.

04:36.810 --> 04:37.843
Welcome, all.

04:41.315 --> 04:43.615
Thank you, Father.

04:45.486 --> 04:50.522
Hi, everybody. Great turnout,
Dad would have liked that. Um...

04:52.526 --> 04:55.627
It just...
It feels funny that he's not here.

04:55.629 --> 04:58.597
I wanna talk to him.
Here, he's got to be down here.

04:59.933 --> 05:03.468
Sorry, just...
I'm gonna bring him down.

05:03.470 --> 05:04.903
I hope it doesn't
offend anybody.

05:08.008 --> 05:10.375
I just...
The Church doesn't like this.

05:10.377 --> 05:13.945
I know the Catholic Church
wants him to stay in the back.

05:13.947 --> 05:15.914
And he only comes in
during the Mass.

05:15.916 --> 05:19.418
That's what they told us,
and I...

05:19.420 --> 05:22.387
I'm not really Catholic anymore.
I mean, I wasn't confirmed.

05:22.389 --> 05:24.356
So I just wanted him
down here, no offense.

05:24.358 --> 05:26.591
Just want to talk to him.
I'm sorry.

05:27.895 --> 05:29.594
Um, yeah.

05:30.931 --> 05:32.331
That feels better.

05:33.801 --> 05:37.869
Well, death is horrible.

05:39.707 --> 05:43.475
Man, we've been through
something, haven't we? Oh, gosh.

05:43.477 --> 05:45.544
It went on and on and on.

05:48.716 --> 05:49.732
Let me tell you.

05:49.733 --> 05:50.749
This man is a fighter.

05:56.423 --> 05:58.490
Hey, great job on the...

05:59.760 --> 06:01.960
- Color.
- OK.

06:01.962 --> 06:04.496
Color or black and white?

06:04.498 --> 06:07.566
Color is more expensive. Dad looks
pretty good in black and white, right?

06:07.568 --> 06:08.967
Zak, Zak, Zak,
we aren't there yet.

06:08.969 --> 06:11.570
We haven't still got
the order for the liturgy.

06:11.572 --> 06:13.105
Eddie, how's the eulogy coming?

06:13.107 --> 06:16.475
Um, well, listen, folks,
we have priorities tonight.

06:16.477 --> 06:19.845
Semifinals,<i> Idol,</i>
is on right now!

06:19.847 --> 06:22.414
Oh, my God,
that pigtailed country girl?

06:22.416 --> 06:23.949
I like what she's cookin'.

06:23.951 --> 06:25.784
You like her boobs,
if that's what you mean.

06:25.786 --> 06:28.086
She's good.
That fat black girl, she's fantastic.

06:28.088 --> 06:29.521
She's gonna win it.

06:29.523 --> 06:30.989
The pigtails, the
boobs, and the voice.

06:30.991 --> 06:32.724
Sorry, that's just how it is.

06:32.726 --> 06:34.793
If you're fat on <i> Idol,</i>
you're gonna win.

06:34.795 --> 06:36.828
Could we stop
with the fat, please?

06:36.830 --> 06:39.765
Guys. We've got to finish
the service in the next hour.

06:41.502 --> 06:44.469
- Jesus. Sorry, Dad.
- Oh, fuck!

06:44.471 --> 06:46.538
Can we watch it
with the F-bombs, please?

06:46.540 --> 06:50.709
You don't wing a fu...
A eulogy, Eddie.

06:50.711 --> 06:52.577
Too many people
are counting on you.

06:52.579 --> 06:53.945
I think I'm gonna wing it.

06:54.848 --> 06:56.181
Father Rose called,

06:56.183 --> 06:57.716
and he wants to see the eulogy

06:57.718 --> 07:00.018
so he can refer to it
for the homily.

07:00.020 --> 07:02.154
"Father Rose sat on a tack.
Father Rose."

07:02.156 --> 07:05.991
OK. OK. I think,
we're all probably pretty low blood sugar.

07:05.993 --> 07:08.660
- So, here we go.
- -Oh, what do we have here?

07:08.662 --> 07:10.629
We have some
delicious sandwiches.

07:10.631 --> 07:12.898
- I've reached Uber Lord Warrior.
- Jay, get off that, please.

07:12.900 --> 07:14.900
It's three echelons above
Black Death Swamp Field.

07:14.902 --> 07:16.635
Did you hear what I said?
Please get off that.

07:16.637 --> 07:18.770
That's until the Black
Death Swamp, right there,

07:18.772 --> 07:20.872
- seeps into an open orifice.
- Oh!

07:20.874 --> 07:23.642
- OK. Enough. Off with that, please!
- Have you seen this?

07:23.644 --> 07:25.710
- These are great, Diane.
- Yes, I've seen it.

07:25.712 --> 07:27.679
- Please. Off.
- My immunity crystal broke.

07:27.681 --> 07:29.047
- You suck.
- Shit.

07:29.049 --> 07:30.949
All right,
what have we got here?

07:30.951 --> 07:34.019
Right here is a vegan surprise,
and it's a cheese steak,

07:34.021 --> 07:38.056
but with hummus and a quinoa
paste which is delicious.

07:38.058 --> 07:42.661
Ooh, and then this one.
Diet, gluten-free Chicken Caesar Wrap.

07:42.663 --> 07:44.963
Huh. I didn't know
that you were vegan.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.531
She is so not.

07:46.533 --> 07:48.200
Attitude and tone, please.

07:48.202 --> 07:50.669
I get them from
Pick-a-Deli-Square.

07:50.671 --> 07:53.104
My Curves trainer is the one
that set me up with them.

07:53.106 --> 07:55.507
- Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
- Funny. Hilarious.

07:55.509 --> 07:58.510
She eats chocolate pretzels every
night, but that's OK, right, Mom?

08:02.583 --> 08:04.983
This family is so judgmental.

08:04.985 --> 08:07.118
I would have made
a delicious family dinner,

08:07.120 --> 08:10.055
but my father just died,
and I'm mourning him, all right?

08:10.057 --> 08:12.924
Diane, I didn't ask you
to cook, OK? This is fine.

08:12.926 --> 08:14.759
- This is great.
- It is fine.

08:14.761 --> 08:16.828
And don't expect waffles
and eggs tomorrow.

08:16.830 --> 08:19.164
- Just cereal, all right?
- Do you want waffles and eggs?

08:19.166 --> 08:21.132
- Just cereal...
- No, we didn't...

08:21.134 --> 08:23.969
Minus the Black Death,
if that's all right with you, Jay!

08:23.971 --> 08:25.904
You suck.

08:27.908 --> 08:29.741
I'm processing!

08:30.711 --> 08:31.743
Fuck!

08:32.679 --> 08:34.712
No, you...

08:34.715 --> 08:38.049
No, just let him go.
He'll be fine.

08:39.253 --> 08:43.955
You know, as devout a Catholic

08:43.957 --> 08:46.958
as Dad was,
he didn't want to go to heaven.

08:48.729 --> 08:51.963
He did not...
want to meet Jesus.

08:51.965 --> 08:54.032
No, he fought...

08:55.035 --> 08:57.135
every day in that hospital.

08:57.137 --> 09:01.673
He fought to stay here.
He wanted another day...

09:01.675 --> 09:04.175
on Earth. Didn't you, Dad?

09:04.177 --> 09:05.677
He wanted another day with you.

09:07.114 --> 09:08.713
He loved you.

09:09.550 --> 09:14.119
He wanted...
my God, a steamed crab.

09:14.121 --> 09:17.155
You know, he wanted a cold beer.

09:17.157 --> 09:20.926
He wanted another day at the beach.
He wanted to walk down that boardwalk.

09:23.997 --> 09:26.064
You know, at the end,
he just wanted...

09:27.034 --> 09:29.167
just another sip of water.

09:29.169 --> 09:31.970
And I wish I could have
given it to him, ya know?

09:32.973 --> 09:36.641
He just wanted one more.
One more breath.

09:44.151 --> 09:45.650
Wow.

09:51.625 --> 09:54.125
Wow. That looks good.

09:56.797 --> 09:59.864
You still doing
the valet thing in Chicago?

09:59.866 --> 10:02.934
I'm a doorman, Dad,
at the Peninsula.

10:02.936 --> 10:06.204
It's a five-star hotel.
It's a pretty big deal.

10:06.206 --> 10:08.306
I told you
get a civil service job.

10:08.308 --> 10:10.175
You never have
to worry about a thing.

10:10.177 --> 10:12.010
Secure. Go for the security.

10:12.012 --> 10:14.813
Security. Yes, sir.
Join the Army.

10:17.718 --> 10:20.085
I fought for my country.
I was half your age.

10:20.087 --> 10:23.622
I stayed in the service
just to sock some cash away.

10:23.624 --> 10:24.823
- Nothing wrong with that.
- Yeah.

10:24.825 --> 10:26.691
Dad, it was
the Vietnam War, remember?

10:26.693 --> 10:30.028
You were drafted,
so I don't really think you had a choice.

10:30.030 --> 10:32.797
When you grow up
with very little,

10:32.799 --> 10:35.233
you learn to appreciate the
security the Army gives you.

10:35.235 --> 10:40.972
Dad, you and I both know I never would
have made it in the fucking Army.

10:43.143 --> 10:47.145
I would have given my left nut
to really... really be an artist,

10:47.147 --> 10:51.116
but we had you kids,
and I had to step up, you know?

10:51.118 --> 10:53.051
A struggling cartoonist?

10:53.053 --> 10:55.654
I mean, you can't feed four mouths.
Forget about it.

10:55.656 --> 10:59.924
Oh, yeah, life is full
of disappointment.

10:59.926 --> 11:02.327
"You're never gonna
get what you want."

11:02.329 --> 11:05.263
You used to tell us
that, Dad, right?

11:06.867 --> 11:08.266
What the hell is this all
about, anyway?

11:08.268 --> 11:10.301
- Nothing, I just said...
- What's up your ass?

11:10.303 --> 11:12.270
Whatever you didn't achieve,
whatever disappointments that you had,

11:12.272 --> 11:13.672
that's your own.

11:13.674 --> 11:14.839
Regrets? I have
no goddamn regrets.

11:14.841 --> 11:16.441
Oh, come on. That's bullshit.

11:16.443 --> 11:18.743
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about, regrets.

11:18.745 --> 11:22.013
Well, look around! The art.

11:22.015 --> 11:24.082
This is what gave you joy.
You're an artist.

11:24.084 --> 11:26.284
You will never understand
that kind of responsibility.

11:26.286 --> 11:29.354
Those kids standing there, looking at you.
"What are you gonna do, Dad?"

11:29.356 --> 11:31.156
It's just you.

11:31.158 --> 11:34.359
Kids. Boom, boom, boom, boom.
There they are.

11:34.361 --> 11:36.461
Feed 'em. Take care of 'em.

11:36.463 --> 11:40.799
Your life is looking at your own
face in the mirror, what the hell?

11:42.035 --> 11:43.435
It's not the same thing, is it?

11:43.437 --> 11:46.037
Because I'm not a dad,
I don't know?

11:46.039 --> 11:49.174
You have to admit,
my friend, you...

11:49.176 --> 11:50.875
You took the low road.

11:50.877 --> 11:52.110
Oh, my God. Well, that's...

11:52.112 --> 11:54.746
You and your whole
goddamn generation.

11:54.748 --> 11:56.381
"Me, me, what do I want?"

11:56.383 --> 11:59.417
I've worked hard ever
since I was 12 years old,

11:59.419 --> 12:01.753
every fucking day,
and you know it.

12:01.755 --> 12:04.089
I've been retired for 24 years.

12:04.091 --> 12:07.859
I work harder now than I ever
did in my life. You see all this?

12:07.861 --> 12:09.794
Where do you think it came from?

12:09.796 --> 12:13.398
It came from my work.
Work! I lived, Eddie.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.233
I'm waiting for
the other part, Dad.

12:16.369 --> 12:18.803
Come on.
I know you want to say it.

12:18.805 --> 12:23.074
I haven't accomplished
anything with my life.

12:23.076 --> 12:24.943
Isn't that what you want to say?

12:27.948 --> 12:29.214
Son...

12:29.215 --> 12:30.481
you're drinking a beer
in the afternoon.

12:30.484 --> 12:32.751
You offered it to me.

12:34.221 --> 12:39.891
Whenever I drink a beer at night,
it's because I've earned it.

12:39.893 --> 12:41.526
You got to build a life, Eddie.

12:41.528 --> 12:43.962
Brick by brick.
You got to build it.

12:43.964 --> 12:47.098
What are you saying?
I didn't fucking earn this beer?

12:47.100 --> 12:50.535
Notre Dame just intercepted
on the five-yard line.

12:50.537 --> 12:52.303
They are going to score.
Come on. Come on.

12:52.305 --> 12:55.306
- I forgot about the game.
- Notre Dame. Go, go.

12:55.308 --> 12:57.108
I'll be right there.

13:04.785 --> 13:07.385
I kind of, um, forgot
what I was gonna say.

13:10.023 --> 13:12.457
Andy, you want to say something?

13:12.459 --> 13:15.059
Yeah, sure, Eddie. Yeah.

13:15.896 --> 13:17.195
Hi, everybody.

13:17.197 --> 13:19.998
I just, uh, happen
to have some notes.

13:20.000 --> 13:25.804
Here. I'm so grateful to God
that Dad was our father.

13:25.806 --> 13:29.240
Because he...
He was also our hero.

13:29.242 --> 13:32.010
He taught us how to be tough

13:32.012 --> 13:34.112
and to stand up
for what we believed in,

13:34.114 --> 13:36.080
and he always supported us,

13:36.082 --> 13:39.918
because he taught us that life is
tough, and you have to be tough.

13:39.920 --> 13:43.288
Because life is scary.
It's not all peace and love,

13:43.290 --> 13:46.324
and everybody doesn't
always win a trophy.

13:46.326 --> 13:47.992
And you got to be tough.

13:47.994 --> 13:50.528
And you got to be a man.
And that was my dad.

13:50.530 --> 13:53.164
I remember when I was came
home from school one day,

13:53.166 --> 13:55.500
and a school bully
had called me fat,

13:55.502 --> 13:57.602
and I was upset, and I told Dad.

13:57.604 --> 13:59.904
And he said,
"You turn your butt around,

13:59.906 --> 14:03.341
you go back to that school, and you
punch that slob right in the nose."

14:03.343 --> 14:06.277
And I knew my dad loved me,
even if he never said it,

14:06.279 --> 14:08.179
because then he gave me
a big hug.

14:08.181 --> 14:11.349
And my dad... my dad's hugs, man,

14:11.351 --> 14:15.286
he gave us those big bearhugs,
you know, didn't he, Diane?

14:15.288 --> 14:18.623
He gave us all the bearhugs,
Right? He... Zak? Eddie?

14:18.625 --> 14:21.359
He gave us bearhugs, 'cause he loved
us, and he was tough.

14:21.361 --> 14:24.195
My dad was a tough guy.
He was a man.

14:24.197 --> 14:27.365
He was tough,
and he didn't need to say he loved us.

14:27.367 --> 14:33.004
We knew it, and he gave us
hugs, and he was a good man.

14:35.508 --> 14:37.275
Thanks, buddy.

14:38.345 --> 14:40.645
I'll just...
I'll put it back now,

14:40.647 --> 14:42.113
Then you can start.

14:42.115 --> 14:44.282
I'll put it right back. OK.

14:45.652 --> 14:47.085
There we go.

14:51.491 --> 14:53.992
Oh, no, jeez. I'm sorry.

14:53.994 --> 14:55.226
All right. It's OK.

14:57.497 --> 14:58.497
Sorry.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.467
All right. I think we're good.
Father.

15:09.609 --> 15:12.176
When's the last time I've been to a Mass?
I don't know.

15:12.178 --> 15:15.146
- You should read it.
- I really don't...

15:15.148 --> 15:17.081
- They want me to read this.
- OK.

15:18.218 --> 15:22.086
Ah! "Intercession Prayers:
In Baptism, Robert Mills"

15:22.088 --> 15:23.454
receive the light of Christ.

15:23.456 --> 15:24.923
Scatter the darkness now,

15:24.925 --> 15:27.625
"and lead him over
the waters of death."

15:27.627 --> 15:29.527
That's very poetic.

15:29.529 --> 15:30.662
Further down.

15:30.664 --> 15:32.230
Uh, "For the sick and dying."

15:32.232 --> 15:33.665
May they find peace
in their suffering."

15:33.667 --> 15:35.700
- That's fine.
- Mm-hmm.

15:35.702 --> 15:37.302
Wait a minute.

15:38.571 --> 15:40.471
"For the unborn?

15:40.473 --> 15:43.238
- "Pray for their mothers
to choose life over death?"

15:43.250 --> 15:44.175
- Unborn?

15:44.177 --> 15:47.011
Yeah, yeah. This is it.

15:47.013 --> 15:49.213
- Yeah.
- Are you kidding me with this?

15:49.215 --> 15:51.282
- What?
- You'd have actually put this in the Mass?

15:51.284 --> 15:53.318
It's what Dad wanted.
He was very pro-life.

15:53.320 --> 15:55.653
We thought the ceremony should
reflect Dad's religious experience.

15:55.655 --> 15:57.155
Right. Right.

15:57.157 --> 15:58.356
My parish says a prayer

15:58.358 --> 16:00.058
for aborted babies every Sunday,

16:00.060 --> 16:01.426
- so they go to heaven.
- I don't care.

16:01.428 --> 16:02.660
So, pro-life Democrats

16:02.662 --> 16:03.695
are all gonna just burn in hell?

16:03.697 --> 16:05.029
Oh, my gosh, I knew you guys

16:05.031 --> 16:06.297
would make this about politics.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.166
Where is the word Democrat
anywhere in there?

16:08.168 --> 16:10.168
You're completely
politicizing Dad's funeral.

16:10.170 --> 16:11.569
This has absolutely nothing
to do with politics,

16:11.571 --> 16:13.438
- all right?
- Oh, it does.

16:13.440 --> 16:15.640
<i>Roe v. Wade</i> is going to be overturned.
Deal with it!

16:15.642 --> 16:18.042
- It's not going to be overturned.
- That's a political stance.

16:18.044 --> 16:20.078
- Why do you always go there?
- Over my dead body.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.714
I don't want to interrupt.
I'm sorry, but you want to go soon?

16:22.716 --> 16:24.349
Oh, yeah. Yeah, we will.

16:24.351 --> 16:27.318
- Come on over.
- I'm just... I'm tired.

16:27.320 --> 16:30.088
I know, baby.
It's been a tough day.

16:30.090 --> 16:32.323
I don't know...

16:32.325 --> 16:37.061
I don't know whether... what
people wear to be cremated,

16:37.063 --> 16:40.732
because this is
his favorite suit, but...

16:40.734 --> 16:43.267
he loved other things, too.

16:43.269 --> 16:46.270
- Loved the one that...
- When he wears the one...

16:46.272 --> 16:49.440
Oh, no, no, no,
you have to let the doggies out.

16:49.442 --> 16:52.477
- OK. We will. We will.
- We'll take care of it.

16:52.479 --> 16:55.213
You'll be all right.

16:55.215 --> 16:57.181
Your dad's been very organized.

16:57.183 --> 16:59.350
I won't have to
worry about a thing.

17:00.353 --> 17:02.286
Why are we even
talking about this?

17:02.288 --> 17:04.288
I don't want to be
a burden on anybody, OK?

17:04.290 --> 17:06.124
And you should all know this.

17:06.126 --> 17:07.492
Look, I'm not getting
any younger,

17:07.493 --> 17:09.727
and I probably won't
get much older either.

17:09.729 --> 17:12.329
And, um, your dad's
gonna be cremated.

17:12.332 --> 17:16.034
- I just want you to know.
- Wow. Cremation?

17:16.036 --> 17:18.102
Wow. Great topic for lunch.

17:18.104 --> 17:20.405
- Look...
- And he doesn't want a viewing either.

17:20.406 --> 17:22.373
Hey, look, it's what I want.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.776
Isn't that right, sweetheart?
You don't want a viewing?

17:24.778 --> 17:26.778
So, don't blame me, any of you.

17:26.780 --> 17:28.512
Really? Why is that, Dad?

17:28.515 --> 17:32.817
Your stepmother doesn't like
being surprised or scared.

17:32.819 --> 17:35.720
Ah, come on, a viewing
is creepy, anyway.

17:35.722 --> 17:40.091
Well, the reason you have a viewing
is so people can pay their respects.

17:40.093 --> 17:42.193
Oh, come on with this.

17:42.195 --> 17:45.663
Your family can have time to process
the loss before jumping into a funeral.

17:45.665 --> 17:48.766
Look she doesn't want it, OK?
That's good enough for me.

17:48.768 --> 17:51.135
I owe my whole life
to this woman.

17:51.137 --> 17:52.270
That's right.

17:52.272 --> 17:54.238
I can't stand surprises.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.541
That's why I always read
the books backwards.

17:56.543 --> 17:59.710
Hold it. You read the
endings of books first?

17:59.712 --> 18:02.480
Yes, I do.
I read the last page first,

18:02.482 --> 18:06.350
because if I don't know the
ending, I get very, very anxious.

18:06.352 --> 18:07.752
- I never knew that.
- Me neither.

18:07.754 --> 18:09.420
Very interesting.

18:09.422 --> 18:12.490
Dad, a viewing is not
about you. It's for us,

18:12.492 --> 18:14.525
the people left behind
who are still grieving.

18:14.527 --> 18:16.494
Can you imagine Dawn
staring down at me?

18:16.496 --> 18:20.832
I'm cold in the coffin, like this...
Stop.

18:20.834 --> 18:22.834
She would have that last
image of me haunting her,

18:22.836 --> 18:25.269
thinking I'm gonna rise up
out of the coffin like...

18:26.739 --> 18:28.573
Stop it, Bob.

18:32.479 --> 18:34.412
Oh, no.
Abner and Dusty, no, wait.

18:34.414 --> 18:37.715
Wait. Dusty. No, no, no, no, no.
Come on. Come on.

18:37.717 --> 18:39.450
They're stealing the...

18:39.452 --> 18:41.452
Pickles. He loves pickles.
Give him a pickle.

18:41.454 --> 18:43.470
Come here, sweetheart.
Come here, baby boy.

18:43.482 --> 18:44.188
Knock it off.

18:44.190 --> 18:46.624
- Knock it off, the two of you.
- Go on. Sit down.

18:46.626 --> 18:50.294
Sit down. Be quiet.
That's right. Look at me.

18:51.131 --> 18:52.296
All right.

18:53.700 --> 18:55.266
Dad, you're looking slim.

18:55.268 --> 18:58.669
Lost three notches on the belt.

18:58.671 --> 19:00.204
Not bad, huh?

19:00.206 --> 19:03.207
- Thank you.
- I listen to the old boss.

19:03.209 --> 19:07.245
- Low sodium, no sugar. Portion control.
- There you go.

19:07.247 --> 19:10.481
- He's lost 18 pounds.
- Hey!

19:10.483 --> 19:13.217
Remind me, honey.
We have to get more fish oil supplements

19:13.219 --> 19:17.522
on the way back from your eye exam
on Friday. We'll get it at Costco.

19:17.524 --> 19:20.758
Your father doesn't
burn enough calories

19:20.760 --> 19:22.627
without exercise anymore.

19:22.629 --> 19:24.896
He can't go on his cardio
walks with me at all.

19:24.898 --> 19:29.400
I just can't breathe. I told her
take the dogs, do it without me.

19:29.402 --> 19:32.370
And Bernie, Bernie's a good man.
He can keep up with her.

19:32.372 --> 19:33.804
Who's this Bernie?

19:33.806 --> 19:36.374
Oh, he's four houses down.

19:36.376 --> 19:38.643
He's that beautiful house
with holly and roses.

19:38.645 --> 19:41.512
I help him with his Greyhound
Rescue every other Sunday.

19:41.514 --> 19:44.215
Bernie is a...
He's a good-looking man.

19:44.217 --> 19:47.418
He's got salt-and-pepper
hair, and he's tall.

19:47.420 --> 19:49.587
And, yeah, he's really handsome.

19:49.589 --> 19:51.322
Mmm. That's Bernie.

19:53.259 --> 19:56.527
Well, I can't give up
my workouts.

19:56.529 --> 19:59.564
- Dad, I had no idea you weren't walking.
- Yeah.

19:59.566 --> 20:02.533
Until we get to the bottom of
this breathing problem, you know?

20:02.535 --> 20:05.670
Yeah, the cardiologist
thinks it's emphysema.

20:05.672 --> 20:08.506
The pulmonary specialist
thinks it's his heart.

20:08.508 --> 20:12.677
Just pray it's not emphysema.

20:12.679 --> 20:15.680
When this man turned 73,
he started falling apart.

20:17.984 --> 20:20.751
Listen, he's the Bionic Man.
What have you got inside there?

20:20.753 --> 20:24.922
You've got a pacemaker,
two valve replacements.

20:24.924 --> 20:26.857
- How many stents you got?
- Five.

20:26.859 --> 20:29.227
- Five.
- They don't last forever.

20:31.497 --> 20:34.865
Diane, those pounds seem
to be sneaking up on you.

20:34.867 --> 20:36.634
Do you ever
get your thyroid checked?

20:38.671 --> 20:40.238
Not recently, Dawn.

20:40.240 --> 20:42.907
Well, I always get
my thyroid checked,

20:42.909 --> 20:45.543
especially when my clothes
are getting a little tight.

20:46.846 --> 20:49.714
Well, maybe I should just
get my jaw wired shut.

20:53.453 --> 20:54.569
Oh, that's an option.

20:54.570 --> 20:55.686
Oh. Oh, you were kidding.

20:56.689 --> 20:58.322
Wow, I'm so sorry.

21:03.263 --> 21:06.330
Spit.

21:06.332 --> 21:07.698
OK.

21:08.868 --> 21:10.034
- Hey, guys.
- Eddie!

21:10.036 --> 21:12.536
Oh, hey, Eddie!

21:12.538 --> 21:14.505
What's this, huh?

21:14.507 --> 21:16.807
I told you on Monday
Eddie was flying in.

21:16.809 --> 21:20.311
He's on so many meds right now,
he can't remember anything.

21:20.313 --> 21:21.712
Nobody told me anything.

21:21.714 --> 21:23.014
Oh, yes, I did.

21:23.016 --> 21:25.283
I must really be in
trouble with you here.

21:25.285 --> 21:27.385
- No. Hi.
- Hi.

21:27.387 --> 21:28.635
Oh, you smell like smoke.

21:28.647 --> 21:30.888
You should be working.
It's a waste of time.

21:30.890 --> 21:32.890
- All I'm doing is sitting here...
- Dad, I was coming anyway.

21:32.892 --> 21:34.058
Getting needles
for Christ sakes.

21:34.060 --> 21:35.860
- I was coming anyway. OK?
- Yeah. Sure.

21:35.862 --> 21:37.862
- You look good.
- Good to see you.

21:37.864 --> 21:39.864
Thanks. I appreciate it.
They're poking me.

21:39.866 --> 21:42.333
They're sticking needles
every place you can think of.

21:42.335 --> 21:45.403
Wow, that looks
like it really smarts, huh?

21:45.405 --> 21:47.505
Heard you missed your flight.

21:47.507 --> 21:49.507
I did. It's a whole story.
It's not important.

21:49.509 --> 21:52.777
- So, you wanna eat?
- Not necessarily.

21:52.779 --> 21:55.379
Well, Andy and Diane are downstairs
at the commissary if you want...

21:55.381 --> 21:56.781
If you're hungry,
you can just...

21:56.783 --> 21:58.516
They're all downstairs
eating lunch.

21:58.518 --> 21:59.784
You're staying
at Diane's, right?

21:59.786 --> 22:01.852
- Yeah.
- There's nothing to do up here.

22:01.854 --> 22:03.854
Might as well go down there and say hello.
I'll tell you,

22:03.856 --> 22:06.624
that 695 is gonna be a shit
show in a couple of hours.

22:06.626 --> 22:08.492
If you want to get going,
now's the time.

22:08.494 --> 22:10.761
Dad. I just got here. I'm not
getting back on the beltway.

22:10.763 --> 22:13.731
You know what happened to me last night?
I couldn't sleep a wink.

22:13.733 --> 22:17.034
Yeah, Abner had diarrhea everywhere
at 1:00 a.m. in the morning.

22:17.036 --> 22:18.769
Sprayed with his tail.
It was unbelievable.

22:18.771 --> 22:20.805
She spent all night cleaning
the carpets for that damn dog.

22:20.807 --> 22:22.344
Dr. Brewster continually
wants us to go on kibble.

22:22.356 --> 22:22.940
He eats too fast,

22:22.942 --> 22:24.775
and he eats too much,
and he's old like me.

22:24.777 --> 22:26.410
He can't eat kibble
without gravy.

22:26.412 --> 22:28.479
You love that dog.
You love that dog.

22:28.481 --> 22:30.448
Oh, come on. You love that dog.

22:30.450 --> 22:32.088
That guy charges as much
as these guys charge here.

22:32.100 --> 22:32.650
You love it.

22:32.652 --> 22:35.119
Hey, you know what?
Maybe I will just let Diane know I'm here.

22:35.121 --> 22:36.554
Okay.

22:36.556 --> 22:38.489
Blood oxygen alarm, Mr. Mills.

22:38.491 --> 22:40.958
No, no, no, don't take the elevator
on the left, it's not working.

22:40.960 --> 22:43.694
- It's not working.
- Well, I'm sure I'll Figure it out.

22:43.696 --> 22:45.463
- See you later.
- Bye.

22:45.465 --> 22:47.698
You in here jibber-jabbering,
when he should be resting?

22:47.700 --> 22:49.767
- He's the jibber-jabberer.
- All right.

22:49.769 --> 22:51.102
You getting
your husband excited?

23:05.852 --> 23:08.119
Dad. Dad. No, no, no.
Don't get up.

23:08.121 --> 23:11.021
D-Dad, no, no, no. Dad. Andy!

23:11.023 --> 23:13.391
- I got to...
- No, no, no. What are you doing?

23:13.393 --> 23:15.426
- I got to take a crap!
- Okay, okay, easy.

23:15.428 --> 23:17.461
Hold on. I got to get behind you.
Over here.

23:17.463 --> 23:19.864
Dad. You doing good.
You're doing good.

23:19.866 --> 23:22.933
Relax, Dad. You're doing great.
Just relax for a second.

23:22.935 --> 23:27.605
Hey, Eddie, be careful of his PICC line,
that goes all the way inside his heart.

23:27.607 --> 23:29.707
- Yeah, be careful.
- I got to move, God damn it!

23:29.709 --> 23:31.008
We're moving. We're moving.

23:31.010 --> 23:32.710
Dad, I need you
to go slower. OK?

23:32.712 --> 23:34.545
Slower? If I go any slower,
I'll shit on your shoes.

23:34.547 --> 23:36.480
Wouldn't be the first time.

23:36.482 --> 23:36.950
I got to back up.

23:36.962 --> 23:38.149
I got you. I got you.
OK. I got you. Sorry.

23:38.151 --> 23:41.419
- OK. Stay with him.
- Stay with him.

23:41.421 --> 23:42.820
- I got it.
- Stay with him.

23:43.723 --> 23:45.589
All right, Dad. Get in there.

23:46.626 --> 23:48.159
I got it. God damn it.

23:48.161 --> 23:50.161
- I got it.
- All right.

23:50.163 --> 23:51.695
Hey, Dad.
It's one more step, Dad.

23:51.697 --> 23:53.431
- Get the hell out of here!
- Okay.

23:53.433 --> 23:55.166
What are you going to do?
Wipe my ass now?

23:55.168 --> 23:58.035
- God!
- Go on!

23:58.037 --> 24:00.838
- Yeah.
- There you go, Dad.

24:04.544 --> 24:06.043
That's my boy.

24:06.045 --> 24:07.178
- Hey!
- Just one more. Oh.

24:07.180 --> 24:08.646
Good morning, Eddie.

24:08.648 --> 24:10.014
- Hey.
- Mornin'. Mornin'.

24:10.016 --> 24:12.516
- How you guys doing?
- Good.

24:12.518 --> 24:15.219
- Phew. Hey, Dad.
- Ready? Ready?

24:15.221 --> 24:17.688
You look great. How you feeling?

24:17.690 --> 24:19.990
- I feel good.
- One more.

24:19.992 --> 24:22.193
You look wonderful, Dawn.

24:22.195 --> 24:25.095
- You do.
- Thank you.

24:25.097 --> 24:29.467
- Oh, sweetheart. Too much.
- Maybe too much sausage.

24:29.469 --> 24:32.770
OK. OK.

24:32.772 --> 24:34.839
Do I need to call
the nurse? You OK?

24:42.515 --> 24:44.715
- You all right?
- You all right?

24:44.717 --> 24:46.183
- All right.
- You want something?

24:46.185 --> 24:48.652
OK. You want something
to drink? Or you're OK?

24:50.089 --> 24:54.725
Oh, you boys... You guys are
really, really great to stay here

24:54.727 --> 24:57.027
and help with your father
like this, but...

24:57.029 --> 24:59.797
- Oh, it's no problem.
- Well, it's not really necessary.

24:59.799 --> 25:01.699
They have a great staff here.

25:01.701 --> 25:03.834
No, the staff here is
not exactly on the ball.

25:03.836 --> 25:07.571
- Well, we love the staff here.
- OK.

25:08.875 --> 25:10.241
You know what? I'm gonna pay you

25:10.243 --> 25:12.109
for all the gas you're using.

25:12.111 --> 25:15.679
- Dawn, you don't have to pay me for gas.
- No, I'm going to.

25:17.550 --> 25:19.984
You know, when I was your age,

25:19.986 --> 25:22.253
I was five years away
from retirement.

25:22.255 --> 25:25.890
I had a full pension
from BATA Shoes.

25:26.792 --> 25:28.993
I'm going to give you the $40.

25:28.995 --> 25:31.228
I'm not taking it.
I'm not taking the cash.

25:31.230 --> 25:32.596
- Take it, Eddie.
- I have my own money.

25:32.598 --> 25:34.865
Take the goddamn $40, will you?

25:34.867 --> 25:37.001
- See?
- OK.

25:37.003 --> 25:39.103
$40 is $40.

25:39.105 --> 25:40.105
Thank you.

25:41.741 --> 25:43.941
So, when are you flying back?

25:43.943 --> 25:47.745
Uh, I just got here.
I flew in yesterday.

25:47.747 --> 25:51.148
- Oh. Ooh. Wait a minute.
- Hold on.

25:51.150 --> 25:54.585
Uh, I got to take this.
I'll be right back.

25:54.587 --> 25:55.653
Be right back, sweetheart.

25:55.655 --> 25:57.021
- Yeah.
- I got him.

25:57.023 --> 25:58.122
- Can you do that?
- Yeah.

25:58.124 --> 25:59.823
- OK.
- Dad.

26:01.327 --> 26:02.927
So you done eating?

26:03.930 --> 26:06.347
Yeah.

26:06.348 --> 26:08.765
You want a little something else?
How about some rice pudding?

26:08.768 --> 26:11.001
You like rice... All right?
A little bit of rice pudding?

26:11.003 --> 26:12.069
- Yeah.
- Here you go.

26:15.741 --> 26:17.608
- Good stuff.
- Right.

26:21.914 --> 26:24.682
Always straight to dessert
for you, right?

26:26.786 --> 26:27.952
Here.

26:29.989 --> 26:32.156
- You like that?
- All right.

26:32.158 --> 26:34.625
That's good. You want to feed
yourself, or you want me to...

26:34.627 --> 26:36.760
- Hand me the goddamn...
- All right.

26:43.169 --> 26:46.937
- God.
- Sorry, Dad. Y-You OK?

26:46.939 --> 26:49.673
You OK? OK. He's choking.

26:49.675 --> 26:51.308
OK. Hold on.

26:51.310 --> 26:53.177
<i>Nursing station. Can I help you?</i>

26:53.179 --> 26:54.945
Yes, my father's choking
on something in here.

26:54.947 --> 26:56.847
- Dad.
- Oh, my God. What's happening?

26:56.849 --> 26:58.882
- Did you call the nurse?
- I did.

26:58.884 --> 27:01.085
- Could you help? Get in here.
- Oh, my God.

27:01.087 --> 27:03.754
God damn it.
Can I get a fucking nurse in here?

27:03.756 --> 27:06.190
- He can only swallow one thing at a time.
- My father's choking to death.

27:06.192 --> 27:08.792
Oh, my God.
Water goes straight to his lungs.

27:08.794 --> 27:11.295
What's happening here?

27:11.297 --> 27:13.731
I was only gone for a second.

27:13.733 --> 27:16.667
- How could you...
- Hang on, Dad.

27:16.669 --> 27:19.637
I'm not...

27:19.639 --> 27:22.272
These hospital staff
don't read anything.

27:22.274 --> 27:24.208
Help me lean him forward.

27:27.747 --> 27:30.814
- That is such a horrible thing to watch.
- I know. Would you please...

27:30.816 --> 27:33.150
Please, Diane,
get a hold of yourself.

27:33.152 --> 27:34.718
Dad, are you OK?

27:34.720 --> 27:37.254
Gentle breaths.
Breathing normally.

27:37.256 --> 27:38.822
Where is the nutritionist?

27:38.824 --> 27:40.658
Would you like to speak
to my supervisor?

27:40.660 --> 27:43.180
Very much. They brought the wrong food?
I mean, that's insanity.

27:45.030 --> 27:46.997
And I would like the
nutritionist up here immediately.

27:46.999 --> 27:48.332
- Right now!
- Thank you.

27:48.334 --> 27:49.900
It's not your fault.

27:49.902 --> 27:52.136
- Dad, you OK?
- Yeah, yeah.

27:52.138 --> 27:56.006
You're all right, sweetheart.
All right. OK, angel.

27:56.008 --> 27:59.943
You're OK. That was scary,
but you're OK, precious.

28:06.018 --> 28:10.187
Until he's re-evaluated,
we need to restrict all foods and liquids.

28:10.189 --> 28:13.424
So, what's that mean?
He can't eat or drink anything?

28:13.426 --> 28:15.959
Well, he's aspirated
into his lungs.

28:15.961 --> 28:18.762
That means...
means a feeding tube?

28:18.764 --> 28:21.699
No, no, no, no, Bob.
He didn't say that.

28:21.701 --> 28:24.068
As a last resort. Yes.

28:24.070 --> 28:26.437
Let's see how the
swallowing test goes,

28:26.439 --> 28:28.305
and we'll go from there.

28:28.307 --> 28:31.208
- Thank you. Thank you, Doctor.
- Thank you, Doctor.

28:33.779 --> 28:35.312
The magic chariot,
it has arrived.

28:35.314 --> 28:37.414
So, hang on a second. Hang on.
Let me explain this to ya.

28:37.416 --> 28:40.250
You're gonna get up real slow.
We got a lot of things to deal with.

28:40.252 --> 28:42.352
I'm gonna put you in there.
Then we go to the swallow clinic.

28:42.354 --> 28:44.755
- All right.
- You're good. You're good.

28:44.757 --> 28:46.924
- You got it.
- There we go. That's good. That's good.

28:46.926 --> 28:48.859
- That's it.
- Okay, I got this.

28:48.861 --> 28:50.928
- Turn. Hang on.
- All right.

28:50.930 --> 28:53.330
- You locked the wheelchair?
- Now get these things.

28:53.332 --> 28:54.865
- I did.
- Oh, God.

28:54.867 --> 28:57.067
- No, no, no.
- Oh, God.

28:57.069 --> 28:59.203
You're on your cables.
You're on your cables.

28:59.205 --> 29:02.039
- That's OK. That's OK.
- Oh, my wrist.

29:02.041 --> 29:05.042
- Diane?
- I'm OK.

29:05.044 --> 29:06.510
What the hell are
you crying for, then?

29:06.512 --> 29:08.212
Because it hurt when I fell.

29:08.214 --> 29:10.114
- Can you get up here, please?
- Oh, my wrist.

29:10.116 --> 29:12.082
Just get to the chair.
Get to the chair, please.

29:12.084 --> 29:15.018
- Hey, Daddy.
- Clear the wires.

29:16.222 --> 29:18.055
There we are. All right.

29:18.057 --> 29:20.023
- How is that?
- Yeah, great.

29:20.025 --> 29:21.992
Nice and easy, guys.
We're gonna go real easy here.

29:21.994 --> 29:23.827
- Dad's connected.
- Let me move this thing.

29:23.829 --> 29:25.462
Move some goddamn thing.

29:25.464 --> 29:27.064
OK. I'm moving it. I got it.

29:27.066 --> 29:28.832
- OK.
- That's perfect.

29:28.834 --> 29:31.001
- You got it?
- All right. Here we go.

29:31.003 --> 29:33.504
OK. Look out. Oh.

29:33.506 --> 29:37.274
No, I understand that, but I can't
work two shifts in a row. No, Zak.

29:37.276 --> 29:41.378
You've got to do a shift.
I can't do 24 hours straight.

29:41.380 --> 29:44.515
So, you call Diane.
Call Andy, 'cause I'm not doing it.

29:44.517 --> 29:47.251
No, someone has
to cover it, not me.

29:47.253 --> 29:49.853
- No. Call Diane. Jesus!
- Hey!

29:49.855 --> 29:52.956
The dude with the broken neck has
the right of way, eh, Dutchy Boy?

29:52.958 --> 29:54.892
God. Brick.

29:54.894 --> 29:57.394
- Man, how are you?
- How am I?

29:57.396 --> 30:00.964
I'm a fucking quadriplegic?
What the fuck? How am I?

30:00.966 --> 30:02.866
Come on. Good to see you.
Pound it out,

30:02.868 --> 30:05.068
right down there
on the right hand. Yup!

30:05.070 --> 30:08.071
Come on. Give me a pound,
give me a pound, give... Ow!

30:08.073 --> 30:10.974
- Oh, my God.
- What the fuck?!

30:10.976 --> 30:12.843
- I'm sorry.
- God, babe, are you...

30:12.845 --> 30:15.879
He can't feel
anything. He can't...

30:15.881 --> 30:18.282
You should have seen your face.
You remember Donna, right?

30:18.284 --> 30:19.950
Yeah, sure, I do.

30:19.952 --> 30:21.285
- Good to see you.
- You don't remember me.

30:21.287 --> 30:24.154
- That's OK. I remember you.
- I do.

30:24.156 --> 30:25.889
- Um...
- What's up, buddy?

30:25.891 --> 30:28.258
I haven't seen you, since...

30:28.260 --> 30:30.227
Since that wave broke
my neck and saved my life.

30:30.229 --> 30:31.895
Best thing that ever
happened to me.

30:31.897 --> 30:33.964
- Praise Jesus.
- Hallelujah.

30:35.100 --> 30:36.567
Brick just aced
his swallow test.

30:36.569 --> 30:38.435
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- Lungs clear.

30:38.437 --> 30:42.072
All the important parts still
working great on my Bricky.

30:42.074 --> 30:44.341
What she's saying,
she mean's my dick is A-OK,

30:44.343 --> 30:47.311
- What? What?
- Oh, gonna get some later. Gonna get some.

30:47.313 --> 30:50.447
Gonna get some. Gonna get some.
Gonna get some.

30:50.449 --> 30:53.217
- Get up. Get up. Get up.
- She gets up on me.

30:53.219 --> 30:55.152
I don't feel nothing.
She just feels everything.

30:55.154 --> 30:57.521
Ten stories tall.
Yeah, we just run me up the flagpole.

30:57.523 --> 31:00.190
- Okay, well, actually...
- Give me some sugar, honey.

31:00.192 --> 31:01.925
- Give me some sugar.
- I, uh...

31:01.927 --> 31:03.327
I can feel that.

31:03.329 --> 31:05.495
My Dad is actually in there
getting a swallow test.

31:05.497 --> 31:06.964
- Oh, yeah? How is he?
- Your dad?

31:06.966 --> 31:08.065
That's why I was here.

31:08.067 --> 31:09.366
Oh, look who the cat dragged in.

31:09.368 --> 31:11.001
- Hey.
- Oh, my God.

31:11.003 --> 31:13.437
- A little high school reunion.
- Hi. How you doing?

31:13.439 --> 31:15.205
- Hi. Wow.
- Sue.

31:15.207 --> 31:17.474
- Yeah. Um...
- Oh. Awkward.

31:17.476 --> 31:19.910
Hey, look at you two.

31:19.912 --> 31:21.411
Why don't you
take her to the prom?

31:21.413 --> 31:24.214
Ask her to the prom.
You could get her a corsage.

31:24.216 --> 31:26.316
Hey, I'm not being a pain in the ass.
I'm just saying.

31:26.318 --> 31:26.798
Yes, you are.

31:26.810 --> 31:28.285
All right. Well, listen.
I'll let you two...

31:28.287 --> 31:30.454
- Van's out front.
- OK. Thank you.

31:30.456 --> 31:33.490
I'll let you two lovebirds do a
little catching up, all right?

31:33.492 --> 31:35.893
Dutchy, we will grab a drink
a little bit later on.

31:35.895 --> 31:38.395
And when I say grab a drink,
I mean you're gonna grab a drink.

31:38.397 --> 31:40.130
You're also gonna
have to grab my drink.

31:40.132 --> 31:42.099
You're gonna have
to also grab me a straw,

31:42.101 --> 31:45.202
- and you might gonna have to maybe grab...
- Get your wallet.

31:45.204 --> 31:47.204
You got to pay
for the drinks, too.

31:47.206 --> 31:50.173
If your feet work, that's the rule.
Don't be a dick, Eddie.

31:50.175 --> 31:52.175
- Walking guys pay.
- Pain in the ass.

31:52.177 --> 31:54.945
I'll see you later.
I can't believe this.

31:54.947 --> 31:58.282
I run into Brick?
Then I run into you.

31:58.284 --> 32:01.652
Yeah. Yeah, I heard
about your dad.

32:01.654 --> 32:03.620
Oh, it's not a big deal.

32:03.622 --> 32:06.390
No, actually it is kind of a big deal.
Actually it sucks.

32:06.392 --> 32:08.358
- Yeah.
- You know.

32:08.360 --> 32:11.361
Yeah, well, I'm just... I'm here
to adjust Brick's PT schedule.

32:11.363 --> 32:13.997
You have to stay on the staff here.
They are so shitty.

32:13.999 --> 32:15.532
I mean, they literally kill
people at this hospital.

32:15.534 --> 32:17.935
- Yeah, I know that.
- Oh, I'm sure they won't.

32:17.937 --> 32:19.469
I'm sure they got
good people in here.

32:19.471 --> 32:22.105
No, they're terrible.
That's why I'm here.

32:22.107 --> 32:23.707
Yeah. We're helping out.

32:23.709 --> 32:25.943
So you're still doing
the nursing thing?

32:25.945 --> 32:27.277
No, I was never a...

32:27.279 --> 32:30.314
Post-op cardiac catheter
lab technician thing.

32:30.316 --> 32:32.616
- OK. OK.
- That's not the same thing.

32:32.618 --> 32:37.020
- How's Dr. Wojowo-whoitz?
- Dr. Daniel Wojowulitz.

32:37.022 --> 32:40.090
- Oh, yeah, Dr. Dan, the proctologist.
- Neurologist.

32:40.092 --> 32:41.558
- Same thing.
- Mmm.

32:41.560 --> 32:44.461
It's not. He's, um...

32:44.463 --> 32:47.497
He's, you know,
finishing up his residency at Columbia.

32:47.499 --> 32:48.966
That's great. Good. Good.

32:48.968 --> 32:50.500
- Kids are great.
- Kids?

32:50.502 --> 32:52.502
- I thought you had one kid.
- Yeah. I got two.

32:52.504 --> 32:56.239
Two boys, Devon and Derek.

32:56.241 --> 32:58.508
- I should go. Brick's my ride.
- OK.

32:58.510 --> 33:00.310
How long are you in town for?

33:00.312 --> 33:02.646
Like, um, a week.

33:02.648 --> 33:06.183
I'm just letting my mom spoil the
kids before they go to sleepaway camp.

33:06.185 --> 33:09.052
- Tell your mom I said hey.
- Yeah. I will.

33:09.054 --> 33:13.023
It's... How are things?
Really. How...

33:13.025 --> 33:15.726
- With me? Oh, great.
- Yeah.

33:15.728 --> 33:18.261
Not so great.
I don't know. The same.

33:18.263 --> 33:21.331
I'm a doorman.
I'm broke, single.

33:21.333 --> 33:24.034
What happened to what's her name?
You know, with the...

33:24.036 --> 33:27.004
Oh, that's been over...
Long time ago.

33:27.006 --> 33:29.740
I-I'm sorry about that.

33:29.742 --> 33:31.742
What are you apologizing for?

33:31.744 --> 33:34.711
I... No idea. I don't know.

33:34.713 --> 33:37.447
I should go.
Brick's waiting and...

33:37.449 --> 33:40.751
You should come by sometime,
meet the kids.

33:40.753 --> 33:42.052
That's not gonna happen.

33:42.054 --> 33:43.320
Yeah, right, why...

33:43.322 --> 33:46.189
Why would you want
to meet my kids?

33:46.191 --> 33:48.358
- Yeah. Take that.
- Hi, honey.

33:48.360 --> 33:52.262
I'm sorry. Yeah. No. I'm,
um, still at the hospital.

33:52.264 --> 33:53.497
Yeah.

34:09.447 --> 34:11.949
Fuck it.

34:37.676 --> 34:40.577
It's all right.
It's OK. It's OK.

34:40.579 --> 34:44.147
How are we doing today, Mr. Mills?
How's it all going here?

34:44.149 --> 34:45.221
We're good.

34:45.233 --> 34:48.485
Oh, I see you've pulled
your feeding tube out.

34:50.789 --> 34:53.790
It's OK, Dad. Dad.

34:53.792 --> 34:58.295
He's moved his feeding tube
out three times.

34:58.297 --> 35:00.464
You know what this means.

35:00.466 --> 35:04.434
I'm gonna get the crew up here,
and we're gonna get dad restrained.

35:04.436 --> 35:07.471
We need another...
Need a change of clothes for him.

35:08.841 --> 35:11.741
Get a crew up here.
Dad, it's all right. Listen to me.

35:11.743 --> 35:13.844
Dad. Dad.

35:13.846 --> 35:17.581
You just pulled out your feeding tube.
It's OK. I'm gonna clean you up.

35:17.583 --> 35:19.516
- OK?
- All right.

35:20.619 --> 35:21.651
I'm gonna clean you up.

35:22.888 --> 35:25.188
I can't...

35:25.190 --> 35:27.591
- That's what I'm saying.
- That's impossible...

35:27.593 --> 35:29.826
in our backyard.
Why can't you guys listen? Listen...

35:29.828 --> 35:32.329
Respiratory is ready to go now.

35:32.331 --> 35:33.830
- So is the cardiac guy.
- Legally, legally,

35:33.832 --> 35:35.398
Dad is like a lawsuit
waiting to happen.

35:35.400 --> 35:37.334
- He's not stable...
- Here's the problem.

35:37.336 --> 35:40.403
Dr. Cho is a fucking hack.
He's just waiting on Dad to die,

35:40.405 --> 35:42.372
so that'll take care
of everything for him.

35:42.374 --> 35:45.242
Bingo. OK. Can we get him
in Hopkins now?

35:45.244 --> 35:46.810
Please. Time is running out.

35:46.812 --> 35:49.479
No. Dawn doesn't want that, Zak.
You know that.

35:49.481 --> 35:51.448
He doesn't want Dawn driving
all the way to Baltimore.

35:51.450 --> 35:53.550
That's insane.
This whole fucking thing is insane.

35:53.552 --> 35:56.486
No. She doesn't want to leave
her fucking dogs is what it is.

35:56.488 --> 35:57.821
Listen, guys.

35:57.823 --> 36:01.358
Dad is fucking starving
right now.

36:01.360 --> 36:02.483
I know. OK, but...

36:02.495 --> 36:05.729
OK. He needs a feeding...
fucking feeding tube today.

36:05.731 --> 36:06.930
Well, fuck me.

36:06.932 --> 36:08.431
Fucking Dr. Cho.

36:10.169 --> 36:11.902
Huh. Interesting.

36:11.904 --> 36:14.571
- Oh, my God. I hope he didn't hear us.
- I don't give a fuck.

36:14.573 --> 36:16.206
- I'm going over there.
- Andy.

36:16.208 --> 36:17.741
Don't go there. Let him eat.

36:17.743 --> 36:19.809
No, I'm gonna go over there
and help you scare him.

36:19.811 --> 36:21.378
Why don't you stay here?

36:21.380 --> 36:23.513
We don't need two hotheads
going over there.

36:23.515 --> 36:25.415
You stay. I'll go with you.

36:25.417 --> 36:29.419
OK. Good, 'cause I need a
witness in case shit goes down.

36:37.496 --> 36:39.262
- Ah. The Mills family.
- Hmm.

36:39.264 --> 36:41.298
- Hello, Doc. Could we get a word with you?
- Yeah.

36:41.300 --> 36:44.267
I'm right in the middle
of my meal break.

36:44.269 --> 36:46.303
That's funny, 'cause our dad,

36:46.305 --> 36:49.406
- he can't get a break at all. Or a meal.
- Yeah.

36:50.943 --> 36:54.411
Do you mind if I finish my bagel and
then we could talk about your father?

36:54.413 --> 36:57.380
- Actually, I do mind.
- Yeah, I mind, too.

36:58.884 --> 37:00.250
OK.

37:01.687 --> 37:02.719
OK.

37:04.423 --> 37:06.556
Your father has
completely blocked lungs,

37:06.558 --> 37:10.594
mass in his upper left lung
caused by the pneumonia.

37:10.596 --> 37:12.829
He's got end-of-life emphysema.

37:12.831 --> 37:17.267
The MRI of his lungs is the worst
I've ever seen on any living patient.

37:17.269 --> 37:19.536
He can barely process oxygen.

37:19.538 --> 37:23.640
He's contracted MRSA,
which is a highly fatal staph infection,

37:23.642 --> 37:26.643
and to combat that,
he's on Zyvox,

37:26.645 --> 37:28.645
which is like interferon.
It's powerful,

37:28.647 --> 37:31.848
and it's so poisonous
that it, too, is fatal.

37:31.850 --> 37:33.850
Your father has diabetes.

37:33.852 --> 37:35.986
His kidneys are failing.

37:35.988 --> 37:38.021
In order to stabilize
his blood sugar,

37:38.023 --> 37:40.490
we have to introduce
nutrients into his body,

37:40.492 --> 37:45.395
and he's lost the ability
to swallow food and water.

37:45.397 --> 37:48.398
How am I supposed to stabilize
your father when I know

37:48.400 --> 37:51.801
that he will die the
second we put him under?

37:58.477 --> 37:59.843
How?

38:00.979 --> 38:03.480
Enjoy your... your lunch.

38:03.482 --> 38:05.548
- Thank you.
- Sorry about that.

38:22.701 --> 38:25.402
He's got a terrible
bedside manner.

38:29.941 --> 38:33.076
- So, Bob's at Chesapeake Memorial?
- -Yeah.

38:33.078 --> 38:34.678
- It's not good.
- I know.

38:34.680 --> 38:36.579
- It's not good, friend.
- I hate it there.

38:36.581 --> 38:38.014
- Death Hospital.
- What do you mean?

38:38.016 --> 38:40.483
Do you know what they call
people that go there?

38:40.485 --> 38:41.651
- What?
- Dead people.

38:41.653 --> 38:42.719
Would you stop it?

38:42.721 --> 38:44.487
I'm just saying.
Did you try Hopkins?

38:44.489 --> 38:46.323
- Of course we tried Hopkins.
- Well, what up?

38:46.325 --> 38:49.059
He didn't want her
to be in Baltimore,

38:49.061 --> 38:50.927
and she wanted to be
close to the dogs.

38:50.929 --> 38:54.064
- Do you mean those space poodles?
- Yes, yes.

38:54.066 --> 38:55.532
- I hate those things.
- They're cute.

38:55.534 --> 38:57.500
- They're gross.
- OK. I know.

38:57.502 --> 39:00.537
Anyway, it's... it's not a good thing.
I'm glad you met with me.

39:00.539 --> 39:03.740
- I'm completely depressed.
- Hmm. Well,

39:03.742 --> 39:05.909
that's what happens when
you go to a Death Hospital.

39:05.911 --> 39:08.945
It's a roach motel. They check in.
They don't check out.

39:08.947 --> 39:11.081
- Are you trying to depress me?
- They come out in gurneys.

39:11.083 --> 39:13.483
Would you stop it?
'Cause you're being a total dick.

39:13.485 --> 39:14.984
- Whoa. OK. You know what?
- Come on.

39:14.986 --> 39:17.887
Look, V-Man?
We need to hit the worm. Now.

39:20.425 --> 39:22.559
- Whoa. Whoa. Hey. Dude.
- What? Yeah?

39:22.561 --> 39:24.761
- Do you believe in miracles?
- What miracles?

39:24.763 --> 39:27.831
- Yeah. 'Cause one just walked in the door.
- Oh, I see.

39:27.833 --> 39:28.998
- Yeah.
- Very nice.

39:29.000 --> 39:30.367
- You recognize her?
- No.

39:30.369 --> 39:31.801
- You don't?
- Oh!

39:31.803 --> 39:33.570
- Velma Lauren.
- No.

39:33.572 --> 39:36.439
- Vinnie's little sister.
- Get out.

39:36.441 --> 39:38.705
Wait a minute.
Didn't she marry Carl Perkins?

39:38.717 --> 39:39.476
That's right.

39:39.478 --> 39:43.046
That's right but she's not with old
Carl now, because he went to jail

39:43.048 --> 39:44.714
- for selling meth.
- Meth?

39:44.716 --> 39:47.784
Yeah. And she used to work
at Suzie-Q's.

39:47.786 --> 39:49.452
- She's a stripper?
- Yes.

39:49.454 --> 39:51.421
- She used to work the pole.
- Holy sh...

39:51.423 --> 39:53.423
- She was a stripper?
- Yes, she was a stripper.

39:53.425 --> 39:56.893
But now she's an inspector,
BG&E and she smells real nice.

39:56.895 --> 39:59.162
- Oh, my God.
- She looks amazing.

39:59.164 --> 40:02.399
- No, would you stop it?
- Yes. Come on. Come on. You're doing this.

40:02.401 --> 40:03.600
- You're Eddie Mills.
- No.

40:03.602 --> 40:05.101
- You deserve this.
- I don't.

40:05.103 --> 40:06.836
- You're doing this.
- I'm not getting that.

40:06.838 --> 40:08.138
- Yes.
- I don't need to get laid.

40:08.140 --> 40:09.639
- Yeah, you do.
- I do not.

40:09.641 --> 40:12.409
You need to take
time off from dying, OK?

40:12.411 --> 40:14.677
Take time off from
this dying stuff.

40:14.679 --> 40:16.913
- I'm not... I don't need this.
- You do need this.

40:16.915 --> 40:18.515
- Buddy, I'm sure.
- Look, I'll pump you up.

40:18.517 --> 40:20.016
- Listen.
- You're Eddie Mills.

40:20.018 --> 40:22.152
- Yeah, Eddie Mills, 25 years ago.
- Senior Class President.

40:22.154 --> 40:23.820
Yeah, 50 pounds heavier.

40:23.822 --> 40:26.055
- Jud from <i> Oklahoma!</i>
- Jud from <i> Oklahoma!</i>

40:26.057 --> 40:29.659
And JV Lacrosse.
You know, you can't win everything.

40:32.464 --> 40:35.131
- Is that Eddie? Eddie Mills?
- Hey.

40:35.133 --> 40:37.434
- Hey.
- Oh, my God. Eddie Mills.

40:37.436 --> 40:38.902
How's it going?

40:38.904 --> 40:41.438
Look... I haven't seen you in...
Oh, my God.

40:41.440 --> 40:43.640
You look so cute.

40:43.642 --> 40:45.842
Oh, wow.
That is quite a welcome.

40:45.844 --> 40:49.045
Eddie frickin' Mills!
What are you doing here?

40:49.047 --> 40:52.916
Just in town. It's great to see you.
You know, back at home.

40:52.918 --> 40:55.485
- You look exactly the same.
- Thank you.

40:55.487 --> 40:58.688
I mean, you know,
he put on a few, right, Matt?

40:58.690 --> 41:00.557
More than a few.

41:00.559 --> 41:02.225
- No, you look really cute.
- You look amazing.

41:02.227 --> 41:03.726
Oh, thanks.

41:03.728 --> 41:05.161
These are new,
do you like these?

41:05.163 --> 41:07.664
Yes, I'm sure I would
have remembered those.

41:07.666 --> 41:10.099
Yeah, I didn't have them when
we were in that show together.

41:10.101 --> 41:11.734
Do you remember what show?

41:11.736 --> 41:13.470
- Yeah.
- Do you remember the show we did together?

41:13.472 --> 41:15.472
It's the <i> South Pacific.</i>

41:15.474 --> 41:16.906
Do you remember when I was in
the show with you? <i>-South Pacific.</i>

41:16.908 --> 41:18.808
- Matt, do you remember?
- What?

41:18.810 --> 41:20.477
OK. It's true. Me and him
never stopped talking about it.

41:20.479 --> 41:22.212
- He prompted me.
- You were so good.

41:22.214 --> 41:24.481
I'm old, and I forget everything,
but how could I forget you?

41:24.483 --> 41:26.583
Yeah, well, my God
I was so obsessed with you.

41:26.585 --> 41:29.085
We need a drink. Vince, we need a drink.
You want to buy me a drink?

41:29.087 --> 41:32.222
Uh, I will buy you a drink. Can I have
a drink here for this lovely lady?

41:32.224 --> 41:34.591
Oh, you've got some. I need a shot.
We got to sit down.

41:34.593 --> 41:36.493
OK. Shot. Sit down. Where?

41:36.495 --> 41:38.228
- I got a booth in the corner.
- Booth.

41:38.230 --> 41:40.063
- It's my favorite place.
- Booth in the corner. Let's go.

41:40.065 --> 41:42.198
- It's kind of like my personal box.
- OK.

41:42.200 --> 41:44.067
Let's go right over here.

41:44.069 --> 41:46.603
- What are you doing here?
- Oh...

41:46.605 --> 41:48.571
it's depressing. My dad's dying.

41:48.573 --> 41:50.240
- Oh, baby.
- Yeah.

41:50.242 --> 41:52.175
- Sorry to hear that.
- But, I'm here to have a good time.

41:52.177 --> 41:53.910
<i>L'chaim.</i>

42:01.019 --> 42:05.188
You want to do a body shot?
Salt, drink, and then lime.

42:05.190 --> 42:06.556
You put it in your mouth.

42:06.558 --> 42:08.725
- OK.
- Mmm.

42:12.931 --> 42:14.864
Wait right here.
I want to get my girls.

42:17.302 --> 42:19.536
Watch yourself.

42:19.538 --> 42:21.004
We'll just do karaoke.

42:21.006 --> 42:22.805
Go with karaoke.

42:28.980 --> 42:33.583
That's good. That's good.
Pick a solo. Pick a solo.

42:44.062 --> 42:47.797
Ah. Well, that's where she was.
She was there.

42:47.799 --> 42:50.800
You know what it's like when you wanna
see someone you don't want to see.

42:50.802 --> 42:52.902
- What's her last name again?
- Deever. Sue Deever.

42:52.904 --> 42:55.939
Yes. Sue Deever.
Oh, she was mean.

42:55.941 --> 42:57.840
- She's a great person.
- No, she's not.

42:57.842 --> 43:00.009
No, she is. She's married.
She's a doctor.

43:00.011 --> 43:02.312
- She's a snob.
- She's a nurse. She has kids.

43:02.314 --> 43:04.314
She's a biatch.

43:04.316 --> 43:06.249
- Would you stop?
- Biatch.

43:06.251 --> 43:07.250
No. I love her.

43:07.252 --> 43:09.586
Screw Sue. Fuck me.

43:11.156 --> 43:13.222
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

43:13.224 --> 43:15.758
Baby. Honey.

43:15.760 --> 43:18.061
- Eddie, stop it. Stop it. Stop it.
- OK. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

43:18.063 --> 43:20.363
- Sorry. I'm sorry.
- OK. Almost, almost, almost.

43:20.365 --> 43:22.732
OK, sing. Sing for me, baby.
Sing for me.

43:22.734 --> 43:24.901
- Sing what?
- Sing something.

43:37.983 --> 43:39.849
Okay, don't move. Wait.
I don't want to leak.

43:41.620 --> 43:43.653
- OK. Oh.
- I got it.

43:48.860 --> 43:50.960
- Phew.
- That's a tight squeeze.

43:50.962 --> 43:52.695
- It is.
- Isn't that fun?

43:52.697 --> 43:55.732
OK. Oh, shit. All right.
I got to get going.

43:55.734 --> 43:57.967
I told Carl like a half hour
ago, I'd be back.

43:57.969 --> 44:01.804
Hold on. Carl Perkins?
You guys are divorced.

44:01.806 --> 44:03.906
Oh, no, sweetie.
We're just separated.

44:03.908 --> 44:06.009
- We're workin' on it.
- What?

44:06.011 --> 44:09.245
He always loved you, by the way.
I'm gonna tell him you say hi.

44:09.247 --> 44:10.813
Thanks, baby. That was fun.

44:13.652 --> 44:15.785
OK. I'll see ya.

44:19.090 --> 44:20.690
Mm.

44:46.151 --> 44:50.019
A-And as I said,
my team is standing by to go

44:50.021 --> 44:52.388
as soon as Dr. Rabinowitz here

44:52.390 --> 44:54.891
can assure me that
Mr. Mills is stable.

44:54.893 --> 44:56.025
PEG.

44:57.328 --> 45:00.897
Percutaneous
endoscopic gastrostomy.

45:00.899 --> 45:02.398
What's that first word again?

45:02.400 --> 45:05.435
Percuta... Percutaneous?
Percutaneous.

45:05.437 --> 45:10.873
Yeah, a feeding tube here,
is inserted through the stomach wall,

45:10.875 --> 45:13.743
Cho's doing this.
I'm not do this. Um...

45:13.745 --> 45:14.977
in order for your father to eat.

45:14.979 --> 45:17.213
And as we've discussed,

45:17.215 --> 45:20.349
this operation has,
at best, at best,

45:20.351 --> 45:22.185
a 5% chance of succeeding.

45:22.187 --> 45:26.789
Well, the numbers increase to
10%, possibly 12%,

45:26.791 --> 45:29.192
depending upon how quickly
Dr. Cho finishes.

45:29.194 --> 45:32.095
After my team inserts the
feeding tube into the stomach,

45:32.097 --> 45:35.064
Respiratory here would like
an extra few minutes

45:35.066 --> 45:37.266
to clear away some of
the bronchial obstructions.

45:37.268 --> 45:42.271
Right. What I would like to
do is open a breathing tract

45:42.273 --> 45:46.242
here, by extracting
some of the diseased...

45:46.244 --> 45:48.211
Excuse me, ma'am.
We'll just do it on you.

45:48.213 --> 45:52.782
Uh, by extracting some of the
diseased tissue at the right quadrant,

45:52.784 --> 45:54.817
uh, which is basically
just above the lungs.

45:54.819 --> 45:58.254
And increased air flow should give
your father more of a fighting chance.

45:58.256 --> 46:03.960
Yeah, but extending the procedure by
even a minute decreases Bob's chances.

46:03.962 --> 46:06.028
And we may never get him back.

46:06.030 --> 46:08.498
We're taking the risk.
We've already discussed it.

46:08.500 --> 46:11.033
We're not doing hospice at home.

46:11.035 --> 46:14.337
Because, I cannot
stand it anymore.

46:16.040 --> 46:18.207
- Listen to me. Listen to me.
- Oh, God.

46:18.209 --> 46:22.445
I watched my brother die,
all right, gasping like a...

46:22.447 --> 46:25.848
Like a beached whale,
and I'm not gonna put her through that.

46:25.850 --> 46:29.886
If we do nothing at all,
he will starve to death.

46:29.888 --> 46:32.922
That'd take, uh,
two to three weeks.

46:32.924 --> 46:34.457
We're doing the feeding tube.

46:34.459 --> 46:36.959
We've already decided.
It's the feeding tube.

46:36.961 --> 46:38.995
And let me tell you
something, children.

46:38.997 --> 46:41.798
I have one life to live,
and I'm going to live it.

46:41.800 --> 46:44.267
This pain and suffering,
no more.

46:44.269 --> 46:47.804
I cannot take it one more day.
It's done. Done.

46:48.873 --> 46:50.072
If this doesn't work...

46:51.276 --> 46:53.943
- if you can't make this work...
- OK.

46:53.945 --> 46:55.444
- You got three days.
- Let me...

46:55.446 --> 46:57.480
After three days,
you pull the plug.

46:57.482 --> 46:59.549
- All right?
- Let me get this on your face. Come on.

46:59.551 --> 47:02.084
- You pull the goddamn plug.
- Sir.

47:02.086 --> 47:04.153
- I'm not gonna put her through this.
- Sir. Sir.

47:04.155 --> 47:06.189
Babe, please,
please, please, please.

47:06.191 --> 47:08.391
You heard it.
That's it. Three days.

47:08.393 --> 47:09.959
That's it.

47:09.961 --> 47:11.427
And I think it's
important for the family

47:11.429 --> 47:13.563
to understand your father
and mother's wishes.

47:13.565 --> 47:16.132
I've seen this
tear families apart.

47:18.102 --> 47:19.402
OK. We good?

47:21.306 --> 47:22.306
All right.

47:31.916 --> 47:34.183
Who's this? Who's this?

47:34.185 --> 47:35.384
- Is that a janitor?
- Maybe.

47:36.988 --> 47:38.988
- How you doing?
- Hi.

47:40.558 --> 47:44.861
How you doing?
Lousy. Sucks, right?

47:44.863 --> 47:47.597
I'm Joey. Uh, Mills,
you're the Mills?

47:47.599 --> 47:49.866
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

47:49.868 --> 47:53.402
My cousin's the boss. He doesn't usually
like me to interact with the... the...

47:54.539 --> 47:58.007
clientele. I'm "in training."

47:58.009 --> 48:02.211
So kind of a mid-life
career sort of a reboot.

48:02.213 --> 48:05.348
What color is
my parachute? Blue.

48:05.350 --> 48:10.119
So, uh, I'm... I'm gonna
be driving your dad.

48:10.121 --> 48:15.358
Uh, his body,
and you're following me, right?

48:15.360 --> 48:16.959
- Yeah.
- OK.

48:16.961 --> 48:18.628
And, uh, thing is we
got to kinda move it along,

48:18.630 --> 48:20.229
'cause we got
a 9:00 a.m. viewing.

48:20.231 --> 48:23.032
Teenage kid. Motorcycle
versus cement truck,

48:23.034 --> 48:26.235
so it's a real... real mess.

48:26.237 --> 48:29.305
Giuseppe, my cousin, the boss,
he's... He's in there right now

48:29.307 --> 48:31.140
trying to figure out
which parts go where.

48:31.142 --> 48:33.409
Um, but he's an artist. I mean,

48:33.411 --> 48:35.544
he could put Humpty Dumpty
back together again.

48:35.546 --> 48:36.946
- Hey!
- Yeah.

48:36.948 --> 48:37.980
Here he is.

48:37.982 --> 48:39.515
- Hey!
- Gotta go.

48:43.254 --> 48:45.221
I told you never, never.

48:45.223 --> 48:48.257
- Not with my clientele.
- What? I was doing fine here.

48:48.259 --> 48:50.459
- Yes. I <i> capisce.</i>
- OK. Go.

48:55.266 --> 48:59.368
<i>Bon giorno.</i> Hello.
Nice to make your acquaintance.

48:59.370 --> 49:00.670
Forgive me to be late.

49:00.672 --> 49:03.439
I apologize.
I had much to put together.

49:03.441 --> 49:07.143
Ah, well if you now gather each
other, we walk in the back.

49:07.145 --> 49:08.377
Your father is waiting.

49:12.383 --> 49:14.317
Are we getting out
of the fucking car?

49:15.553 --> 49:18.387
They can't give him
the Haldol to sleep...

49:19.424 --> 49:21.357
because of the feeding
tube procedure.

49:22.660 --> 49:24.226
He has to be coherent.

49:26.664 --> 49:30.433
He had a terrible night's
sleep last night. Poor baby.

49:30.435 --> 49:33.269
Dad? Dad?

49:35.406 --> 49:38.441
- Is he...
- No, he's... he's... he's sleeping.

49:38.443 --> 49:41.711
Sleeping with his eyes open.
It just started.

49:41.713 --> 49:43.713
He sleeps that way now.

49:43.715 --> 49:48.184
I can't... can't think about it.

49:48.186 --> 49:51.620
Um... Oh, I gave him
a sponge bath.

49:51.622 --> 49:55.358
And he doesn't ask for his bridge
anymore, because at this point

49:55.360 --> 49:57.560
he doesn't eat anymore,
so it doesn't matter.

49:57.562 --> 50:01.630
We only put his teeth in
when we have visitors.

50:01.632 --> 50:03.366
What did they say
about the bedsores?

50:03.368 --> 50:05.334
They don't seem
too concerned about it.

50:05.336 --> 50:06.736
What does that mean?

50:06.738 --> 50:10.239
I don't know. Ask the doctors.

50:10.241 --> 50:13.009
They're sending in
a bed team to evaluate him.

50:14.112 --> 50:15.378
Just I don't know when.

50:17.081 --> 50:20.149
- Where you going, Dawn?
- Chores. Bills.

50:20.151 --> 50:22.118
Abner's diarrhea.

50:22.120 --> 50:27.223
He... Your father did everything
with me for 35 years.

50:29.293 --> 50:31.227
See you later, sweetie pie.

50:32.764 --> 50:34.397
See you.

50:37.301 --> 50:39.201
- Dressed to the nines?
- I know.

50:39.203 --> 50:41.771
She's going to have lunch
with that Bernie.

50:41.773 --> 50:43.305
Oh, the... the dog walker guy?

50:43.307 --> 50:45.241
- That guy. Are you kidding me? Yes.
- Really?

50:45.243 --> 50:47.243
- Have you met him?
- Yeah, I've met him.

50:47.245 --> 50:48.811
- He's like a Dapper Dan.
- OK.

50:48.813 --> 50:51.113
He's horrible, and come on.

50:51.115 --> 50:54.417
I know Dad's gonna need his feeding
tube any minute, and she can't take it.

50:54.419 --> 50:57.386
- Yeah, she's gone through a lot.
- Everyone's going through a lot.

50:57.388 --> 50:59.555
You know what she's doing?
She's afraid to be alone.

50:59.557 --> 51:00.421
That's true.

51:00.433 --> 51:03.059
She's setting up Bernie
for sloppy seconds.

51:03.061 --> 51:04.126
That's harsh of you.

51:04.128 --> 51:05.461
She's processing.

51:05.463 --> 51:07.329
She's got to leave the room
every now and then.

51:07.331 --> 51:08.531
That's what she's doing. I know.

51:08.533 --> 51:10.099
Sloppy seconds. That's not fair.

51:10.101 --> 51:12.168
- You know it's the truth.
- Hey, Dad.

51:12.170 --> 51:14.270
- Dad, how you doing?
- Oh, my God.

51:14.272 --> 51:17.206
- Dad. Hey.
- Take...

51:17.842 --> 51:19.308
Take care of her.

51:21.446 --> 51:23.612
Take care of her.
You promise me.

51:24.515 --> 51:26.482
- Promise!
- I will. I promise.

51:59.283 --> 52:01.851
Bye, Eddie. I love you.

52:01.853 --> 52:04.453
- You, too, Dad.
- I love you.

52:13.197 --> 52:15.831
Plain cremation box.

52:15.833 --> 52:17.299
Hey.

52:20.438 --> 52:22.605
Somebody want to
identify the father,

52:22.607 --> 52:25.207
and then we're gonna be
on our way.

52:25.209 --> 52:26.642
- I'll do it.
- OK.

52:30.314 --> 52:32.515
Ah, that's definitely Bob.

52:32.517 --> 52:36.886
Something exerted enough, uh,
pressure to compress his nasal cavity,

52:36.888 --> 52:39.188
- but it's... it's Bob.
- What?

52:39.190 --> 52:41.257
Well, his nose is flat.

52:41.259 --> 52:43.759
- I'm gonna go wait in the car.
- Oh, honey.

52:43.761 --> 52:46.695
- The nose is flat. No, no, no.
- Oh, yeah.

52:47.865 --> 52:50.499
Oh, my God, yes,
it is very flat.

52:50.501 --> 52:52.601
- I'm very sorry.
- Uh, it happens sometimes.

52:52.603 --> 52:54.703
In the freezer,
we got to make room.

52:54.705 --> 52:57.706
So you stack 'em on top of each other.
That makes perfect sense.

52:57.708 --> 53:00.409
- Yes. And then things shift.
- All right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

53:00.411 --> 53:03.179
But he's dead,
so it doesn't matter, OK?

53:03.181 --> 53:04.747
Joey, should we follow you?

53:04.749 --> 53:06.315
Just one thing.

53:06.317 --> 53:08.651
Well, are you gonna
tell 'em or you want...

53:08.653 --> 53:12.488
Our normal incinerator
in Towson just broke,

53:12.490 --> 53:14.823
so we're going to have
to shift the body

53:14.825 --> 53:17.927
to the backup crematorium
in Dundalk.

53:17.929 --> 53:20.763
A-And why is that a problem?

53:20.765 --> 53:22.798
It also serves a double purpose.

53:22.800 --> 53:27.203
It provides crematorial
services for the animals.

53:28.372 --> 53:30.506
- What? Animals?
- Cats and dogs?

53:30.508 --> 53:33.375
- Animals?
- It's not a bad crematorium.

53:33.377 --> 53:34.977
No, it's very good.

53:34.979 --> 53:37.313
It's just it's not that great.

53:37.315 --> 53:38.881
- Well, it's still...
- The crew is OK.

53:38.883 --> 53:42.418
It's... The thing about it
is the name. It's a little...

53:42.420 --> 53:43.586
- What's the name?
- What's the name?

53:43.588 --> 53:46.589
Peaceful Paws. It's beautiful.

53:46.591 --> 53:49.291
- We only use this furnace in a pinch.
- Peaceful Fucking...

53:49.293 --> 53:50.826
Guys, guys. Come on.

53:50.828 --> 53:53.562
Is there a discount if we're
not using a human crematorium?

53:53.564 --> 53:56.398
What, it's cats,
people, stardust.

53:56.400 --> 53:58.968
It's calcium phosphate
in the end. It just...

53:58.970 --> 54:00.703
- Right.
- Sure. That's it.

54:00.705 --> 54:02.238
- Chop-chop.
- Joey?

54:02.240 --> 54:03.606
- Yeah?
- When we get the ashes back,

54:03.608 --> 54:05.674
it better be my fucking dad
and not Lassie.

54:05.676 --> 54:07.743
- Absolutely.
- Please, don't worry.

54:07.745 --> 54:10.446
- Hey, let's go.
- Everybody. Everybody.

54:10.448 --> 54:15.284
Hindu belief is that the body can
only release the soul through fire.

54:15.286 --> 54:16.819
It's cool, right?
So historically...

54:16.821 --> 54:19.588
Tim, give it
a fucking rest, all right?

54:19.590 --> 54:21.857
- Let me breathe.
- It's ready.

54:21.859 --> 54:23.959
- Last door on the right.
- I got this.

54:23.961 --> 54:26.795
- Go, go, go, go.
- It's OK.

54:26.797 --> 54:28.564
Oh.

54:29.834 --> 54:32.301
Just give me a minute.
Let me breathe.

54:32.303 --> 54:34.270
Let me breathe.

54:34.272 --> 54:36.572
You're all right?

54:36.574 --> 54:38.340
You're OK. You're gonna be OK.

54:38.342 --> 54:40.743
I'm gonna be OK,
but you got to give me a minute.

54:42.647 --> 54:44.480
All right. Here we go.

54:44.482 --> 54:46.432
OK? OK?

54:46.433 --> 54:48.383
- Give her some water.
- Just take one step at a time.

54:48.386 --> 54:49.952
- Yeah, here we go.
- That's the way.

54:49.954 --> 54:52.488
- He's my father. My father.
- That's exactly right.

54:52.490 --> 54:56.558
- I know.
- It's a little dog with angel wings.

54:56.560 --> 55:02.498
Dogs are comforting to people
when they are grieving.

55:02.500 --> 55:05.567
- Another dog? It's sort of strange, but...
- Another dog.

55:05.569 --> 55:07.770
- Must be a collector.
- Yes.

55:07.772 --> 55:09.638
My God, it stinks in here.

55:09.640 --> 55:11.707
Well, typically,
all living things,

55:11.709 --> 55:14.443
after a while, the fats and proteins,
they get to a certain temperature,

55:14.445 --> 55:15.844
- and you know what happens.
- Tim.

55:15.846 --> 55:17.880
- Yeah?
- Interesting, but not right now.

55:17.882 --> 55:20.382
- OK. I'm sorry.
- OK. Guys. We got to go.

55:20.384 --> 55:22.384
- He said the last...
- Get in there. Get in there.

55:22.386 --> 55:23.719
I'll go. I'll go first. I'll go.

55:23.721 --> 55:26.322
- Go, go. Run. Run.
- Come on.

55:28.559 --> 55:30.959
Hey, you can't be in here.

55:35.099 --> 55:39.401
No, no. It's OK, Diane.
Be quiet. It's OK.

55:39.403 --> 55:41.804
Peaceful Fucking Paws.

55:41.806 --> 55:44.540
- What the hell is this?
- OK.

55:44.542 --> 55:47.543
How did I miss it?
There's dogs everywhere.

55:47.545 --> 55:51.080
We didn't want this to happen.

55:51.082 --> 55:55.417
Please, let's take Dad home,
and then we just bury him in the backyard.

55:55.419 --> 55:58.654
Oh, bury him in the backyard?
Oh, so the raccoons could just dig him up?

55:58.656 --> 56:00.856
- Raccoons aren't going to dig him up.
- We can't do that.

56:00.858 --> 56:02.558
- Why not?
- It's illegal.

56:02.560 --> 56:05.894
This was our deal, Diane.
You wanted to come.

56:05.896 --> 56:09.064
This is my father, too.
It's not your deal.

56:09.066 --> 56:10.699
Well, it's all of our father.

56:10.701 --> 56:13.836
I can't believe he's here.
Oh, my God.

56:13.838 --> 56:16.538
Guys. Guys, gentleman wants
to say a couple words.

56:16.540 --> 56:19.074
That was professionally
disgusting.

56:19.076 --> 56:21.510
- I'm so fucking sorry.
- Yeah.

56:21.512 --> 56:23.779
And fuck, shit,
now I'm being vulgar.

56:24.982 --> 56:27.483
I apologize, and look, a woman

56:27.485 --> 56:30.886
owning her grief here, there is
nothing more beautiful. Come here.

56:30.888 --> 56:31.920
Bring it in.

56:32.957 --> 56:34.890
You go ahead. You let it out.

56:34.892 --> 56:37.626
You let it out.

56:39.997 --> 56:42.398
Joey, is it?

56:43.033 --> 56:45.134
You got a real knack for this.

56:45.136 --> 56:47.836
Thank you.

56:47.838 --> 56:52.408
So, I have cleared the
room of all dead animals.

56:52.410 --> 56:55.844
Only your dad in there.
Cross my heart.

56:55.846 --> 56:57.880
Thing is we kinda
got to get it rolling,

56:57.882 --> 56:59.681
'cause the burn takes
about four hours.

56:59.683 --> 57:01.984
And it's a process. We got to...

57:01.986 --> 57:04.953
I don't want to get into it,
but there's a burn then a smash, grind,

57:04.955 --> 57:07.823
and then you do it again, it's like
a lather, rinse, repeat kind of...

57:07.825 --> 57:10.926
- I think... We get it.
- OK. May I?

57:13.631 --> 57:14.897
Don't know why everybody's
so worried about this?

57:14.899 --> 57:17.566
It's like running around
a side of beef.

57:25.810 --> 57:26.842
Anything?

57:32.049 --> 57:33.649
How was chapel?

57:33.651 --> 57:36.084
Well, it's nice.
It's nice little chapel.

57:36.086 --> 57:37.786
Well, I hope it works.

57:37.788 --> 57:39.755
Just 'cause you don't
have a God to pray to?

57:39.757 --> 57:41.207
Oh, my God.

57:41.208 --> 57:42.658
Can we at least pretend
to be a family?

57:42.660 --> 57:44.092
This is not the time
or the place.

57:44.094 --> 57:46.061
We are all under a lot pressure.

57:46.063 --> 57:49.064
I mean, what time is it?
How long has he been under?

57:49.066 --> 57:51.934
Too long. Too fucking long.

57:51.936 --> 57:54.102
Mom and Dad
tried to save him, but...

57:54.104 --> 57:57.873
he started smoking pot
with his sarcastic friends.

57:57.875 --> 57:59.675
Sarcastic friends.

57:59.676 --> 58:01.476
You know what? You should
have smoked some pot, Andy.

58:01.479 --> 58:03.712
First Mills in history
to refuse confirmation.

58:03.714 --> 58:07.082
What did you know
at 15 years old?

58:08.552 --> 58:12.554
And look at you now,
a spiritual disgrace.

58:12.556 --> 58:14.790
A what? A spiritual disgrace?

58:14.792 --> 58:17.593
You know, our thoughts
should be with Dad right now.

58:17.595 --> 58:20.762
Don't you worry, pal. I pray.

58:20.764 --> 58:23.999
- I pray.
- Not to Jesus.

58:24.001 --> 58:25.801
Not to Mary.

58:26.937 --> 58:29.738
You talk to yourself,
and you call it prayer.

58:29.740 --> 58:31.807
Nothing happens when you pray.

58:31.809 --> 58:34.209
You don't deserve real grace.

58:34.211 --> 58:35.777
Because you never earned it.

58:44.555 --> 58:45.954
Dad's out of the O.R.

58:50.594 --> 58:53.929
Look, Bob.
All the kids are here.

58:55.099 --> 58:56.732
Doesn't he look great?

59:00.037 --> 59:04.806
Dad, I'd... I'd kiss you,
but you have sepsis. But I'm here.

59:04.808 --> 59:06.975
No worries. No worries, Bob.

59:06.977 --> 59:09.311
You're on medication
for that. It's all okay.

59:09.313 --> 59:11.280
- Hey, Dad.
- Hi, Daddy.

59:11.282 --> 59:12.848
Hey, Dad, how are you?

59:16.253 --> 59:19.621
So... the procedure,
it was a success?

59:20.291 --> 59:21.890
He did wonderfully.

59:21.892 --> 59:24.626
Okay, but he was
under for two hours?

59:24.628 --> 59:26.662
Well, an hour and 49.

59:26.664 --> 59:29.798
The doctors
did such a great job, Bob.

59:29.800 --> 59:32.100
They cleaned out all your lungs.

59:32.102 --> 59:34.202
Look! Look, kids.

59:34.204 --> 59:38.640
He's eating for
the first time in 18 days.

59:38.642 --> 59:40.709
Well, you know, that's...

59:40.711 --> 59:43.078
that's good that he's
finally getting some food.

59:43.080 --> 59:45.113
Why the fuck was he
under so fucking long?

59:45.115 --> 59:46.782
- I know. I know.
- We need some answers.

59:46.784 --> 59:49.618
Andrew, let the doctors
do their jobs.

59:49.620 --> 59:51.119
He's doing fine.

59:51.121 --> 59:53.055
He's just gonna rest and eat,

59:53.057 --> 59:56.158
and in a few days, he's
gonna... he's gonna wake up.

59:56.160 --> 59:59.761
That's right, Dawn.
Dad's a fighter.

01:00:00.698 --> 01:00:02.364
- I'm calling Cho.
- Yeah.

01:00:02.366 --> 01:00:03.932
- I'm gonna kick his ass.
- Yeah.

01:00:03.934 --> 01:00:05.968
He killed him. He killed him.

01:00:05.970 --> 01:00:09.838
I'm gonna sue everyone
that even touched Dad, okay?

01:00:10.808 --> 01:00:11.940
You guys.

01:00:14.812 --> 01:00:16.712
Dr. Schrader,
you just missed him.

01:00:16.714 --> 01:00:19.047
He's Dad's cardiologist
for 20 years.

01:00:19.049 --> 01:00:21.717
Um, he felt he should
have been consulted,

01:00:21.719 --> 01:00:25.387
and, for the life of me,
I just can't figure out why we didn't.

01:00:25.389 --> 01:00:28.023
But, anyway, he said that, um...

01:00:28.025 --> 01:00:31.259
he doesn't think three days is
enough time for your Dad to respond.

01:00:31.261 --> 01:00:34.029
Dawn, Dad said three days.

01:00:34.031 --> 01:00:35.731
It just isn't right.

01:00:35.733 --> 01:00:38.367
Listen, if he can get
his strength back,

01:00:38.369 --> 01:00:40.769
process all this food...

01:00:40.771 --> 01:00:42.137
Dr. Schraeder thinks that...

01:00:42.139 --> 01:00:45.374
That we should give him
at least a week...

01:00:45.376 --> 01:00:47.643
- Oh!
- Maybe two. Maybe two.

01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:50.946
It's gonna be okay.

01:00:54.418 --> 01:00:56.351
You guys know my Dad.

01:00:56.353 --> 01:00:58.020
He's like a bear.

01:00:58.022 --> 01:01:00.188
Look, he played
defensive tackle.

01:01:00.190 --> 01:01:02.824
To see him now, he's just...

01:01:03.394 --> 01:01:05.260
He's like the water boy.

01:01:05.262 --> 01:01:09.865
Hard to see people
sick and dying and...

01:01:09.867 --> 01:01:11.833
Remember when I was
six years old,

01:01:11.835 --> 01:01:15.671
my favorite aunt was in a coma.

01:01:15.673 --> 01:01:19.107
And we used to go
see her before she died.

01:01:20.010 --> 01:01:23.745
And she kinda looked like a...

01:01:23.747 --> 01:01:26.181
Like an inanimate raisin.

01:01:28.185 --> 01:01:30.952
Does that make sense?
I don't know if...

01:01:30.954 --> 01:01:33.155
I don't know
if raisins are animate,

01:01:33.157 --> 01:01:34.790
but that's what she looked like.

01:01:34.792 --> 01:01:36.024
But a golden raisin. I mean,

01:01:36.026 --> 01:01:38.860
she had a... she had
a nice hue to her.

01:01:38.862 --> 01:01:40.462
It was more about...
It was just that...

01:01:40.464 --> 01:01:45.734
It was just a wrinkled,
kinda deformed just...

01:01:45.736 --> 01:01:47.769
It was like the juice
was taken out of her.

01:01:47.771 --> 01:01:49.004
- Yeah.
- Anyways...

01:01:49.006 --> 01:01:51.206
My parents used
to make me kiss her.

01:01:51.208 --> 01:01:52.474
- Eww!
- God.

01:01:52.476 --> 01:01:55.711
Just had horrifying
nightmares for years.

01:01:55.713 --> 01:01:57.446
Man, you know...

01:01:57.448 --> 01:01:59.715
my dad's running triathlons,

01:01:59.717 --> 01:02:02.050
and your dad's dying.

01:02:02.052 --> 01:02:03.485
I just said that.

01:02:03.487 --> 01:02:05.754
- You're... You're stupid.
- Look, man,

01:02:05.756 --> 01:02:08.023
I fucking love your dad!

01:02:08.025 --> 01:02:10.358
- I know.
- I-I love your dad.

01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:13.361
- He's still alive.
- Okay.

01:02:13.363 --> 01:02:16.331
The Lord has a divine plan
for you and your Dad, Eddie.

01:02:16.333 --> 01:02:18.066
Yeah, good old Jesus.

01:02:18.068 --> 01:02:21.770
Brick, you... you can't move,
and you're religious,

01:02:21.772 --> 01:02:23.071
and you're positive.

01:02:23.073 --> 01:02:27.008
And I can move everything,
and I'm depressed.

01:02:27.010 --> 01:02:29.811
When they pulled my lifeless
body out of the water...

01:02:29.813 --> 01:02:31.446
Oh, I love this story.

01:02:31.448 --> 01:02:35.217
The Lord was floating
above the beach.

01:02:35.219 --> 01:02:36.384
You were dead, and then...

01:02:36.386 --> 01:02:40.088
The love just shot out
of his eyes.

01:02:40.090 --> 01:02:43.959
Bam. It was like
I didn't feel...

01:02:43.961 --> 01:02:45.761
I didn't feel alone
at that moment.

01:02:45.763 --> 01:02:48.764
I just felt loved.
I was glowing,

01:02:48.766 --> 01:02:49.965
and Jesus...

01:02:51.268 --> 01:02:52.534
Jesus hooked me up.

01:02:52.536 --> 01:02:56.338
Hold it. The chair...

01:02:56.340 --> 01:02:59.541
The chair is your cross to bear.

01:02:59.543 --> 01:03:01.810
This chair is my salvation.

01:03:03.147 --> 01:03:06.081
My cross to bear is that
we've run out of beer.

01:03:09.453 --> 01:03:11.219
- Let's go, boys.
- Let's go!

01:03:11.221 --> 01:03:12.888
Don't loiter.

01:03:12.890 --> 01:03:15.390
- Okay.
- Tallyho! Tallyho!

01:03:17.227 --> 01:03:20.061
- Don't let me hit the wall.
- Oh! Don't hit the wall.

01:03:21.031 --> 01:03:24.399
Yeah, so my sister's,
uh, Dr. Dan,

01:03:24.401 --> 01:03:27.435
fucking little demented
fuck, never liked him,

01:03:27.437 --> 01:03:29.337
so she left his sorry ass.

01:03:29.339 --> 01:03:30.906
- You kidding me?
- No.

01:03:30.908 --> 01:03:32.340
Whoa! That's huge.

01:03:32.342 --> 01:03:34.376
There's no fairytale ending
for my sister.

01:03:34.378 --> 01:03:36.945
Yeah, she's... she's really
hurting, and you should know that.

01:03:36.947 --> 01:03:39.147
- I don't believe this.
- Oh, whoa!

01:03:39.149 --> 01:03:40.982
- All right.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

01:03:40.984 --> 01:03:43.285
- So, wait a second. The kids.
- I had a little bit to drink.

01:03:43.287 --> 01:03:45.854
- They're getting divorced.
- Yeah.

01:03:45.856 --> 01:03:48.156
Huh? So everything
that Sue told me

01:03:48.158 --> 01:03:51.059
back at the hospital,
what, is that bullshit?

01:03:51.061 --> 01:03:53.495
Uh, I don't know if everything
she told you was bullshit.

01:03:53.497 --> 01:03:55.530
- Well...
- This is a big custody battle.

01:03:55.532 --> 01:03:57.999
- And he's gonna lose.
- Holy hell!

01:03:58.001 --> 01:04:00.969
Life-changing shit,
and she cries a lot.

01:04:00.971 --> 01:04:02.838
- Hmm.
- I don't believe it.

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:05.574
But I don't know.
The Lord giveth.

01:04:05.576 --> 01:04:07.175
- Hey. Hey.
- Yeah?

01:04:07.177 --> 01:04:08.910
- Who's that man?
- Oh, that's Barney.

01:04:08.912 --> 01:04:10.278
That's my night nurse.

01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:11.947
Hey, Barney,
I'll be there in a second.

01:04:11.949 --> 01:04:13.315
Just give me a minute.

01:04:17.321 --> 01:04:19.888
Hey, Matt, can you, uh, give me
and Eddie a second, please?

01:04:19.890 --> 01:04:21.122
- Okay.
- Yeah.

01:04:21.124 --> 01:04:22.257
- Little...
- Yeah.

01:04:22.259 --> 01:04:23.992
- Private.
- Yeah. Are you hesitant?

01:04:23.994 --> 01:04:25.927
- You want me to run you over?
- Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.

01:04:25.929 --> 01:04:27.229
- I'll run you over.
- But, seriously,

01:04:27.231 --> 01:04:29.564
you're not bullshitting me
today, about Sue?

01:04:29.566 --> 01:04:30.932
I'm not bullshitting you.

01:04:32.502 --> 01:04:34.402
- Eddie.
- Yeah?

01:04:34.404 --> 01:04:36.171
Why don't you crash here?
You're shit-faced.

01:04:36.173 --> 01:04:38.106
What? Nah, dude,
I'll get an Uber.

01:04:38.108 --> 01:04:39.941
- No, don't get an Uber.
- I'll get an Uber.

01:04:39.943 --> 01:04:41.543
No, I got to
come clean with you.

01:04:41.545 --> 01:04:45.447
My body's shot.
Any breath could be my last.

01:04:45.449 --> 01:04:47.582
You... No! Stop that.

01:04:47.584 --> 01:04:50.051
My nephew Devon,
he looks a lot like you.

01:04:50.053 --> 01:04:52.020
I'm sorry. It had to be said.

01:04:53.490 --> 01:04:55.056
What are you... Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:04:55.058 --> 01:04:57.225
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold up.

01:04:57.227 --> 01:04:59.394
What are you talking about?

01:04:59.396 --> 01:05:00.962
- The kid's yours.
- What?

01:05:00.964 --> 01:05:02.497
And it's never been right
you didn't know.

01:05:02.499 --> 01:05:04.366
- You're shitting me.
- I'm not shitting you.

01:05:04.368 --> 01:05:06.401
Remember that fling
you and my sister had

01:05:06.403 --> 01:05:08.069
at the Aberdeen reunion?

01:05:08.071 --> 01:05:09.137
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:05:09.139 --> 01:05:11.206
- Seven years ago.
- Exactly.

01:05:11.208 --> 01:05:13.508
Kid's yours. No question.

01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:16.044
You're a dad. Had to be said.

01:05:16.914 --> 01:05:18.079
Crash here.

01:05:18.081 --> 01:05:19.581
Blueberry pancakes
tomorrow morning.

01:05:19.583 --> 01:05:20.949
You can meet him.

01:05:24.988 --> 01:05:26.321
I'll leave the door open.

01:05:46.677 --> 01:05:49.110
Oh, my God.

01:05:49.112 --> 01:05:50.645
- Hey.
- I was just going down here.

01:05:50.647 --> 01:05:51.646
- And then...
- Uh-huh.

01:05:51.648 --> 01:05:53.148
- And then, boom!
- Yeah.

01:05:53.150 --> 01:05:55.250
Where I didn't even know
how I got here.

01:05:55.252 --> 01:05:57.485
You were hanging out
with Brick last night, huh?

01:05:57.487 --> 01:05:59.421
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:05:59.423 --> 01:06:01.489
- I guess so.
- Yeah.

01:06:01.491 --> 01:06:02.991
He's... That guy is crazy.

01:06:02.993 --> 01:06:05.026
He drank me right
under the table again.

01:06:05.028 --> 01:06:06.294
- Uh-huh. He told you?
- Uh, listen, I...

01:06:06.296 --> 01:06:08.063
- So he told you?
- I'm sorry?

01:06:08.065 --> 01:06:09.364
He told you about my thing,
didn't he?

01:06:09.366 --> 01:06:11.032
- No, no, he didn't tell...
- Yeah, he did.

01:06:11.034 --> 01:06:12.267
No, no, I don't know
anything about it...

01:06:12.269 --> 01:06:15.003
It's okay.

01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:17.505
Ow.

01:06:20.177 --> 01:06:21.609
- Ow.
- You all right?

01:06:21.611 --> 01:06:24.179
Sue, it's okay. You don't
have to mother me, okay?

01:06:24.181 --> 01:06:26.147
- I just hit a little...
- It's okay.

01:06:26.149 --> 01:06:29.050
- What did I hit?
- It's... I'm a highly trained...

01:06:29.052 --> 01:06:30.685
- Move your hands.
- Ah!

01:06:30.687 --> 01:06:32.287
Okay, I think you'll live.

01:06:32.289 --> 01:06:34.055
I think you'll live.

01:06:34.057 --> 01:06:35.323
You're still drunk, huh?

01:06:35.325 --> 01:06:37.192
- Uh, a little drunk.
- Yeah, you are.

01:06:37.194 --> 01:06:38.426
- Here.
- No, I really...

01:06:38.428 --> 01:06:40.295
- I got to go to the hospital.
- Let me see.

01:06:40.297 --> 01:06:42.263
I got to get to the hospital.
Not for me. It's for my Dad.

01:06:42.265 --> 01:06:44.065
- Yeah, I...
- My Dad is in the hospital.

01:06:44.067 --> 01:06:46.001
I work at the hospital now.
Get in, weirdo.

01:06:46.003 --> 01:06:47.402
Come on. Come on.
Just get in the...

01:06:47.404 --> 01:06:50.071
- That's right.
- Come on. You're okay..

01:06:50.073 --> 01:06:51.206
I'm going to get blood
all over the place.

01:06:51.208 --> 01:06:52.741
It's all right. I have kids.

01:06:52.743 --> 01:06:54.142
Oh, jeez.

01:06:55.645 --> 01:06:58.613
So, you know, I'm at the grocery
store, and there's this coed,

01:06:58.615 --> 01:07:00.749
comes up to me, and she
starts saying all this shit,

01:07:00.751 --> 01:07:04.185
you know, like, shit that my husband
has done with, like, multiple people.

01:07:04.187 --> 01:07:05.453
- Uh-huh.
- At the same time.

01:07:05.455 --> 01:07:07.455
- And, they're going public.
- Oh.

01:07:07.457 --> 01:07:10.191
They've gone to the dean.
I'm, like, wh-what is happening?

01:07:10.193 --> 01:07:12.127
Right? My kids are with... My
fucking kids were with me.

01:07:12.129 --> 01:07:13.728
- That's amazing.
- So I go home.

01:07:13.730 --> 01:07:16.364
And, you know, I figured
I'll pull up his computer.

01:07:16.366 --> 01:07:19.534
And I find this, like, folder inside
of a folder inside of a folder

01:07:19.536 --> 01:07:21.169
that says "Private Stuff,"

01:07:21.171 --> 01:07:26.274
and I just find some really,
really just perverted shit.

01:07:26.276 --> 01:07:27.776
- Wow.
- You know, I'm like...

01:07:27.778 --> 01:07:30.378
God damn it, we have kids!
God damn it!

01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:33.648
It's just like he blew up
our lives, you know?

01:07:33.650 --> 01:07:35.050
Yeah.

01:07:36.053 --> 01:07:37.352
So I left him,

01:07:37.354 --> 01:07:39.354
- got a restraining order.
- Of course you did.

01:07:39.356 --> 01:07:41.589
Instead of beating him to death.

01:07:42.559 --> 01:07:43.825
God, Sue, I'm sorry.

01:07:43.827 --> 01:07:46.161
I haven't even told my kids yet.

01:07:46.163 --> 01:07:47.429
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

01:07:47.431 --> 01:07:49.664
How do you say that
to your child?

01:07:49.666 --> 01:07:51.332
"Hey your Dad's a pervert,

01:07:51.334 --> 01:07:53.268
and we can't go home,
'cause everybody knows."

01:07:53.270 --> 01:07:55.470
- Like, how do you even like...
- Are you asking for my opinion?

01:07:55.472 --> 01:07:57.272
About how to speak to children?
'Cause I don't know.

01:07:57.274 --> 01:07:58.540
- I don't know anything about kids.
- No. Calm down.

01:07:58.542 --> 01:08:00.375
I'm not asking you
to talk to my kids.

01:08:00.377 --> 01:08:01.776
- Oh, God, I got to go.
- I have to talk it through.

01:08:01.778 --> 01:08:03.211
- Sue, I got to go.
- Like, we...

01:08:03.213 --> 01:08:04.679
- You got to go?
- Listen, no, listen.

01:08:04.681 --> 01:08:06.781
I'm really sorry about
what you're going through.

01:08:06.783 --> 01:08:09.317
- It's really bad.
- Yeah, it is.

01:08:09.319 --> 01:08:12.587
Um, but my dad
is upstairs, okay?

01:08:12.589 --> 01:08:15.490
There's a whole thing going on,
and I don't feel good. Listen...

01:08:15.492 --> 01:08:17.425
Are you fucking
kidding me right now?

01:08:17.426 --> 01:08:19.160
I know. Dad's upstairs.
I got to go.

01:08:19.162 --> 01:08:21.696
- I'll call you.
- Stop talking, and go.

01:08:21.698 --> 01:08:23.564
I'll call you. Call me!

01:08:24.868 --> 01:08:26.501
Don't call me!

01:08:27.604 --> 01:08:30.305
In the name of Jesus
Christ, Our Lord, you...

01:08:31.374 --> 01:08:32.374
Oh!

01:08:33.443 --> 01:08:34.809
Sorry.

01:08:35.812 --> 01:08:36.845
Sorry.

01:08:36.846 --> 01:08:38.212
Shh!

01:08:39.483 --> 01:08:41.316
Top of the morning
to you, Father.

01:08:41.318 --> 01:08:43.151
Edward.

01:08:43.153 --> 01:08:45.386
- What are you doing?
- Oh.

01:08:46.323 --> 01:08:47.622
Breakfast of champions.

01:08:49.725 --> 01:08:51.626
So last rites again?

01:08:53.130 --> 01:08:54.729
What, third time's
the charm, Father?

01:08:54.731 --> 01:08:56.464
Anointing of the sick.

01:08:56.466 --> 01:08:58.133
Dad's not doing very well.

01:08:58.135 --> 01:09:00.368
Maybe all the
anointing's not helping.

01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:05.206
You need to sober up, son.

01:09:08.444 --> 01:09:09.810
Eddie.

01:09:09.813 --> 01:09:11.779
You're the first.

01:09:11.781 --> 01:09:15.884
Diane just texted that
the 95 is really backed up.

01:09:15.886 --> 01:09:18.286
- Mm.
- Did you hear that, sweetheart?

01:09:18.287 --> 01:09:20.622
Diane's gonna be
just a little bit late.

01:09:20.624 --> 01:09:22.724
- Did you say hello to Eddie?
- Hey, Dad.

01:09:24.361 --> 01:09:27.295
So, what are we
doing today, Dawn?

01:09:27.296 --> 01:09:29.631
Father Rose
is comforting your father.

01:09:29.633 --> 01:09:33.201
Yeah. He doesn't look
very comfortable.

01:09:33.203 --> 01:09:35.203
As a matter of fact,
he looks pretty dead.

01:09:35.906 --> 01:09:37.505
Why would you say that?

01:09:37.506 --> 01:09:39.908
You know what?
How about instead of a prayer,

01:09:39.910 --> 01:09:41.542
why don't we just
give Dad a wish?

01:09:41.545 --> 01:09:46.481
His dying wish,
which was three days, Dawn, okay?

01:09:46.483 --> 01:09:49.250
And that was yesterday.
Today's four.

01:09:49.252 --> 01:09:51.719
Don't you think I know
what today is?

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:54.255
And your drinking
isn't helping anyone, Eddie.

01:09:54.256 --> 01:09:55.857
Son, you're upsetting
your mother.

01:09:55.859 --> 01:09:59.194
She's not my mother,
and I'm not your son.

01:09:59.196 --> 01:10:00.962
Watch our tone, Edward.
That's a warning.

01:10:00.964 --> 01:10:02.897
You know what, Father?

01:10:02.899 --> 01:10:05.600
Unless you specialize
in resurrections,

01:10:05.602 --> 01:10:07.635
I suggest you mind your
own fucking business.

01:10:07.637 --> 01:10:10.605
Stop it! I'm not taking anymore.
I'm not listening.

01:10:15.612 --> 01:10:18.413
Hmm. Uh-oh.
What's going on here?

01:10:19.282 --> 01:10:21.649
What? Hey. Hey! Easy.

01:10:22.686 --> 01:10:24.519
Jesus.

01:10:25.755 --> 01:10:28.423
Hey, easy. Ow!

01:10:28.425 --> 01:10:30.658
Honor thy father,
and honor thy mother

01:10:30.660 --> 01:10:32.927
as the Lord thy God
has commanded you.

01:10:32.929 --> 01:10:34.829
Okay?

01:10:34.831 --> 01:10:37.665
- You want another smack?
- No, no, I don't. The nose.

01:10:38.935 --> 01:10:40.902
Think about doing
the right thing,

01:10:40.904 --> 01:10:42.470
and then apologize
to your stepmother.

01:10:42.472 --> 01:10:44.939
- Okay.
- And then get some coffee.

01:10:44.941 --> 01:10:46.407
I will.

01:11:13.903 --> 01:11:15.603
Thanks a lot.

01:11:15.605 --> 01:11:18.539
He can't do that!
No, that's cheating.

01:11:18.541 --> 01:11:19.574
Derek!

01:11:20.944 --> 01:11:22.343
Jesus!

01:11:24.481 --> 01:11:27.415
Boys. Don't point those guns
at each other.

01:11:28.585 --> 01:11:30.385
Who's that?

01:11:35.625 --> 01:11:36.824
Mister?

01:11:36.826 --> 01:11:37.826
Oh.

01:11:41.564 --> 01:11:44.799
I'm Derek.
This is Devon. You OK?

01:11:44.801 --> 01:11:47.035
Hey, guys. I'm good.

01:11:47.037 --> 01:11:50.471
You live on the street,
like those people we feed at Christmas?

01:11:51.408 --> 01:11:52.840
No, I'm Eddie.

01:11:52.842 --> 01:11:55.677
Uh, I'm Eddie.
Good to meet you guys.

01:11:55.679 --> 01:11:57.779
Hey, why don't you bring that
homeless guy up to the driveway?

01:11:57.781 --> 01:11:59.347
He's an old friend of mine.

01:12:00.717 --> 01:12:02.317
Hi, Brick. No, no.

01:12:02.319 --> 01:12:04.052
- You're, uh, you're Devon?
- Yeah.

01:12:04.054 --> 01:12:05.853
Nice to meet you, Devon.

01:12:05.855 --> 01:12:08.890
Good to meet you... Derek.

01:12:14.564 --> 01:12:18.366
Hey... Is... What's he...
Is he... Brick?

01:12:18.368 --> 01:12:20.001
Go get Mom!

01:12:20.003 --> 01:12:21.002
Brick!

01:12:21.004 --> 01:12:22.637
- Mom!
- Buddy?

01:12:22.639 --> 01:12:25.006
- Check the pump for power.
- What's going on?

01:12:25.008 --> 01:12:26.407
He's not breathing.
He's not breathing.

01:12:26.409 --> 01:12:27.775
Stop the chair.

01:12:30.513 --> 01:12:32.080
Check the portal
for obstructions.

01:12:32.082 --> 01:12:34.415
Uh, turn the blue knob to ten,

01:12:34.417 --> 01:12:35.550
and restart the pump.

01:12:37.087 --> 01:12:38.453
Uncle Brick?

01:12:39.556 --> 01:12:41.689
- Inhaler.
- Inhaler.

01:12:46.796 --> 01:12:47.796
Good?

01:12:49.466 --> 01:12:50.732
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

01:12:50.734 --> 01:12:51.899
Thank you, buddy.

01:12:51.901 --> 01:12:53.368
Thank you, Devon.

01:12:53.370 --> 01:12:55.002
You almost gave me
a fucking heart attack.

01:12:55.004 --> 01:12:56.070
You shouldn't cuss.

01:12:56.072 --> 01:12:58.373
Shit. I'm sorry.

01:12:58.375 --> 01:13:00.475
Devon, you saved
my paralyzed butt yet again.

01:13:00.477 --> 01:13:01.676
You're the best, pal.

01:13:02.846 --> 01:13:04.846
What would you have done
if nobody was here?

01:13:04.848 --> 01:13:06.981
I would have been
having lunch with the Lord.

01:13:09.052 --> 01:13:10.518
Oh, my God.

01:13:13.022 --> 01:13:14.589
Hey, buddy, great job.

01:13:14.591 --> 01:13:16.858
You got some, uh, excellent
little reflexes there.

01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:18.426
You were just all over it.

01:13:18.428 --> 01:13:20.128
- He perfectly sprung over you.
- Hey, a great kid.

01:13:20.130 --> 01:13:22.463
Mom. I started Uncle Brick's
respirator.

01:13:22.465 --> 01:13:24.165
- Right on! Good job. Good job.
- Hey, Sue.

01:13:24.167 --> 01:13:26.167
- Hey, kid. Hey, guys.
- Hey.

01:13:26.169 --> 01:13:27.869
He just had an event
or something.

01:13:27.871 --> 01:13:29.604
- Mm-hmm.
- And he...

01:13:29.606 --> 01:13:31.773
I mean, he scared
the hell outta me.

01:13:31.775 --> 01:13:33.674
Yeah, 'cause he's got asthma

01:13:33.676 --> 01:13:35.443
and he's my stupid smoking,
drinking stoner brother.

01:13:35.445 --> 01:13:36.444
Come on, man.
Don't make me laugh.

01:13:36.446 --> 01:13:37.745
- Ugh.
- Okay? All right.

01:13:37.747 --> 01:13:40.748
He... He saved me.
The little guy saved me.

01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:43.017
Hey, why don't you guys go
inside, wash up for dinner, okay?

01:13:43.019 --> 01:13:44.719
- Can Mr. Eddie stay?
- No.

01:13:44.721 --> 01:13:47.955
- Aw. Why not?
- Yeah? Why not?

01:13:47.957 --> 01:13:50.591
'Cause I said so. Go.
Come on, you little lifesaver.

01:13:50.593 --> 01:13:52.126
- Inside. You, too.
- Hey.

01:13:52.128 --> 01:13:54.529
- Yeah. See?
- Hey.

01:13:54.531 --> 01:13:55.863
Nice to meet you, buddy.

01:13:57.801 --> 01:13:59.634
Hey, look at that. Look at that.

01:13:59.636 --> 01:14:01.969
- Hey. Eddie.
- Yeah?

01:14:01.971 --> 01:14:03.204
What are you doing here, man?

01:14:03.206 --> 01:14:05.173
That's a good question.

01:14:05.175 --> 01:14:06.207
What do you want with me?

01:14:06.209 --> 01:14:07.742
That's a good follow-up.

01:14:07.744 --> 01:14:09.710
Yeah, don't waste my time.

01:14:09.712 --> 01:14:11.846
- Okay.
- I told him, Sue.

01:14:11.848 --> 01:14:13.648
Yeah, I know you told him.
You're a turncoat.

01:14:13.650 --> 01:14:15.817
I don't care.
I know you told him about Daniel...

01:14:15.819 --> 01:14:19.720
No, I, uh, told him... told him.

01:14:22.192 --> 01:14:24.992
You mean, you, like,
you told him that...

01:14:24.994 --> 01:14:25.994
Told him that...

01:14:32.869 --> 01:14:34.168
God, you're a shit.

01:14:34.170 --> 01:14:36.070
God, you're fucking...

01:14:36.072 --> 01:14:39.207
- That doesn't hurt, you know.
- That was my secret to tell.

01:14:39.209 --> 01:14:40.575
God, you're such
a pain in the ass,

01:14:40.577 --> 01:14:41.909
and that was between us.

01:14:41.911 --> 01:14:43.144
Does blood mean nothing?

01:14:43.146 --> 01:14:45.546
God, you're such a dick!

01:14:47.083 --> 01:14:48.616
Secrets suck.

01:14:50.553 --> 01:14:52.753
- Listen, Sue, Sue...
- Don't. Mm-mm.

01:14:54.724 --> 01:14:56.090
No, I won't deal with this.

01:14:57.494 --> 01:14:58.759
- Sue?
- You're gonna go after her?

01:14:58.761 --> 01:15:01.596
No! You saw what she just did.

01:15:01.598 --> 01:15:04.198
She doesn't want anything
to do with me, Brick.

01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:07.001
Well, that might be true,
but you should go double-check.

01:15:25.688 --> 01:15:26.587
Sue!

01:15:26.589 --> 01:15:28.055
God damn it!

01:15:34.731 --> 01:15:36.998
Sue! Sue!

01:15:42.839 --> 01:15:44.038
Damn it.

01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:47.241
These stupid fucking shoe!
It's like...

01:15:47.243 --> 01:15:49.110
That's a hell of a pace
you got going there.

01:15:49.112 --> 01:15:50.912
I'm done with men, you hear me?
All of you.

01:15:50.914 --> 01:15:52.680
- I'm done.
- You all suck.

01:15:52.682 --> 01:15:54.015
- I agree with you.
- If you're here for an apology,

01:15:54.017 --> 01:15:56.717
you're not getting one!
Stay away from me!

01:15:57.687 --> 01:16:00.121
Why? Just tell me, why?

01:16:00.123 --> 01:16:02.723
I don't know, okay? I was...

01:16:02.725 --> 01:16:05.693
I was in New York with Daniel,
and I told everybody this lie

01:16:05.695 --> 01:16:07.728
and after a while,
I started to believe it, okay?

01:16:07.730 --> 01:16:10.898
A secret? For seven years,
you kept a secret?

01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:11.899
Yeah.

01:16:11.901 --> 01:16:13.334
Seven years?

01:16:13.336 --> 01:16:14.869
Yeah.

01:16:16.739 --> 01:16:18.306
- All right.
- Yeah.

01:16:18.308 --> 01:16:20.575
I'm coming closer to you,
all right?

01:16:20.577 --> 01:16:22.176
Please, don't be violent.

01:16:23.780 --> 01:16:27.014
- I don't... Just...
- I will just...

01:16:27.016 --> 01:16:28.056
Just gonna sit right here.

01:16:31.721 --> 01:16:32.853
Hi.

01:16:36.693 --> 01:16:39.060
What would you have said
if I told you...

01:16:39.062 --> 01:16:41.295
- Wh-What would I have said?
- Yeah.

01:16:41.297 --> 01:16:46.734
Oh, I would have said I was in no way,
shape, or form ready to be a father.

01:16:46.736 --> 01:16:47.802
- Yeah.
- No way.

01:16:47.804 --> 01:16:49.804
- I wasn't ready.
- I know.

01:16:51.274 --> 01:16:52.840
I know. I knew that.

01:16:56.245 --> 01:16:58.012
I wanted the baby.

01:17:00.984 --> 01:17:02.149
I wanted the baby.

01:17:03.086 --> 01:17:04.151
And...

01:17:05.688 --> 01:17:08.689
I-I wanted
a little piece of you.

01:17:08.691 --> 01:17:11.759
How did you know it was mine?

01:17:13.196 --> 01:17:15.663
Dan had a vasectomy after Derek,

01:17:15.665 --> 01:17:17.298
- so it was definitely...
- Oh.

01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:19.200
- That's definitive.
- Yeah.

01:17:20.203 --> 01:17:21.636
Did he suspect or...

01:17:21.638 --> 01:17:23.270
Yeah, there's, like, a 1% chance

01:17:23.272 --> 01:17:26.374
you can get knocked up after
you, you know, get your nuts cut.

01:17:26.376 --> 01:17:28.042
- Oh.
- Egotistical asshole

01:17:28.044 --> 01:17:30.878
thought he had, like,
super sperm or something.

01:17:33.916 --> 01:17:35.716
Thanks.

01:17:36.886 --> 01:17:39.987
Little fucker looks and
acts exactly like you.

01:17:39.989 --> 01:17:41.689
He does.

01:17:46.129 --> 01:17:47.361
- Okay.
- Sorry.

01:17:47.363 --> 01:17:49.063
It's okay. Listen.

01:17:52.935 --> 01:17:56.671
I'm gonna say something.
Just hear me out.

01:17:58.074 --> 01:18:03.244
What if I didn't go back
to Chicago right away?

01:18:05.715 --> 01:18:06.981
And I stayed here?

01:18:10.420 --> 01:18:11.852
Don't mess with me.

01:18:11.854 --> 01:18:13.154
Honey, I'm not messing with you.

01:18:13.156 --> 01:18:15.923
I'm not in a place
where I can handle...

01:18:15.925 --> 01:18:17.391
- I'm not messing with you.
- So many...

01:18:17.393 --> 01:18:19.093
I'm not.

01:18:19.095 --> 01:18:20.961
I fucking love you.

01:18:22.732 --> 01:18:23.964
Always have.

01:18:27.303 --> 01:18:29.370
Oh, shit.

01:18:29.372 --> 01:18:30.805
- What is it?
- Well, I just...

01:18:30.807 --> 01:18:32.440
I told them to text me
if anything...

01:18:32.442 --> 01:18:33.874
It is. It's them.

01:18:33.876 --> 01:18:35.976
They're pulling the plug on Dad.

01:18:35.978 --> 01:18:38.079
Listen, I'll call you.
I'll call you later.

01:18:39.182 --> 01:18:40.981
I'll call you.

01:19:01.404 --> 01:19:04.071
How do you do?
I'm Dr. Clarence Grey.

01:19:04.073 --> 01:19:06.240
How are you?
Yeah, sure, come in.

01:19:06.242 --> 01:19:07.475
Oh, it's a nice group.

01:19:07.477 --> 01:19:10.277
- Yeah. Hi. How are you?
- Daddy.

01:19:10.279 --> 01:19:11.846
Thanks for being here.

01:19:11.848 --> 01:19:13.380
- Hey, Dad.
- All right,

01:19:13.382 --> 01:19:16.851
I do assure you your father
is resting comfortably.

01:19:16.853 --> 01:19:19.820
And we're all present?

01:19:21.491 --> 01:19:23.124
What's happening with our Dad?

01:19:23.126 --> 01:19:26.360
Ah, the time is at
hand, all right?

01:19:26.362 --> 01:19:28.262
Let's go over his vitals, okay?

01:19:28.264 --> 01:19:31.132
Ah, right there,
as we can see on the brain.

01:19:31.134 --> 01:19:34.335
Top line, right there.
Nonreactive. Nonresponsive.

01:19:34.337 --> 01:19:39.774
Oxygen is at 15%. The ventilator is
pushing the lungs to bring in air,

01:19:39.776 --> 01:19:42.777
but the body is
unable to convert it.

01:19:42.779 --> 01:19:47.081
Blood pressure, about 10,
20 beats per minute.

01:19:47.083 --> 01:19:51.018
And even on life support,
that's not viable.

01:19:51.020 --> 01:19:54.889
So what are you saying? Uh...

01:19:54.891 --> 01:19:57.191
how much longer
is Bob gonna live?

01:19:58.494 --> 01:20:00.528
His body is rapidly failing,

01:20:00.530 --> 01:20:02.930
and the brain is nonreactive.

01:20:02.932 --> 01:20:08.836
So what are his options
when... when he wakes up?

01:20:10.139 --> 01:20:13.140
I don't... I don't know
how to be more clear. Uh...

01:20:13.142 --> 01:20:15.543
Dawn, it's time for him to go.

01:20:15.545 --> 01:20:17.478
It's time to say goodbye.

01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:20.214
No. Mm-mmm.

01:20:20.216 --> 01:20:22.950
I don't think... I don't think
that's what the doctor is saying.

01:20:22.952 --> 01:20:25.486
No, that's exactly
what I'm saying.

01:20:25.488 --> 01:20:26.987
When we're ready,

01:20:26.989 --> 01:20:29.890
I will administer
the final shot of morphine.

01:20:29.892 --> 01:20:33.093
You mean... pull the plug?

01:20:34.030 --> 01:20:36.297
We don't like to use that term.

01:20:36.299 --> 01:20:38.165
Um, if it helps,

01:20:38.167 --> 01:20:42.036
you can think that Bob
is pulling his own plug.

01:20:44.307 --> 01:20:48.008
I see. Um, I have to...
I have to walk the dogs.

01:20:48.010 --> 01:20:49.610
It's really important.

01:20:49.612 --> 01:20:53.914
What...
- Go with her, Eddie. - Okay.

01:20:53.916 --> 01:20:55.282
I'll help.

01:20:55.284 --> 01:20:58.452
What... What's happening
with the dog?

01:21:01.090 --> 01:21:04.325
Wait. Pull... Pull in
to the 76, because...

01:21:04.327 --> 01:21:06.093
- we're dreadfully low.
- Okay.

01:21:06.095 --> 01:21:07.862
Okay, we got a half tank, Dawn.

01:21:07.864 --> 01:21:12.399
No, Bob always says that's bad
for the catalytic converter.

01:21:12.401 --> 01:21:14.235
Uh, okay.

01:21:14.237 --> 01:21:16.337
Do you... Okay.

01:21:16.339 --> 01:21:18.606
Hey, careful.

01:21:18.608 --> 01:21:22.476
Tim, um, write down the mileage

01:21:22.478 --> 01:21:25.446
and figure out the MPG.

01:21:25.448 --> 01:21:27.014
- Okay.
- Mileage.

01:21:27.016 --> 01:21:28.582
- Bob always says that.
- Can you tell me the mileage?

01:21:28.584 --> 01:21:30.284
Who cares what the mileage is?!

01:21:30.286 --> 01:21:33.020
She's out of her fucking mind.
Just write anything down.

01:21:34.590 --> 01:21:35.956
Okay.

01:21:37.326 --> 01:21:39.293
- Bob always would need that.
- I'm getting it.

01:21:39.295 --> 01:21:41.061
Oh, my awards card!

01:21:41.063 --> 01:21:44.031
My awards card says
I have a quick wash.

01:21:44.033 --> 01:21:47.001
I've been waiting for that.
I've been waiting for a quick wash.

01:21:50.907 --> 01:21:53.274
Kinda fascinating, isn't it?

01:21:53.276 --> 01:21:56.443
- What? Fascinating?
- She's washing the car.

01:21:56.445 --> 01:21:59.179
Bob is dying, and
she's washing the car.

01:22:00.416 --> 01:22:02.049
Thank you, Mr. Spock.

01:22:03.519 --> 01:22:04.952
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

01:22:08.357 --> 01:22:09.623
Thank you.

01:22:09.625 --> 01:22:12.660
What the hell
are you doing in there?

01:22:12.662 --> 01:22:15.629
It was a two-for-one special.
I couldn't pass it up.

01:22:15.631 --> 01:22:16.997
Tim.

01:22:20.002 --> 01:22:21.669
- Need to go to the bank.
- Okay.

01:22:21.671 --> 01:22:24.371
I need to deposit some checks.

01:22:24.373 --> 01:22:27.141
I need to... Wait.

01:22:27.143 --> 01:22:32.046
Oh, I have my social security check?
I need to sign that.

01:22:32.048 --> 01:22:33.948
- I can sign that.
- Okay.

01:22:33.950 --> 01:22:37.184
But who's going to
sign Bob's check now?

01:22:38.087 --> 01:22:40.054
Who's gonna sign Bob's...

01:22:43.092 --> 01:22:44.558
- Grab her! Grab her!
- I can't breathe.

01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:46.260
- You're gonna be okay.
- I can't breathe.

01:22:46.262 --> 01:22:48.529
I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.

01:22:48.531 --> 01:22:50.564
Dawn, hang in there.
You're gonna be okay.

01:22:50.566 --> 01:22:52.433
- I can't breathe.
- You're gonna be okay.

01:22:52.435 --> 01:22:54.535
We're five minutes away.
We're gonna be right there.

01:22:55.538 --> 01:22:56.971
Five minutes away.

01:23:06.215 --> 01:23:08.682
All right. Everyone is back?

01:23:08.684 --> 01:23:12.286
Let's gather around. Here we go.

01:23:14.156 --> 01:23:17.157
All right, you are all
meant to be here, okay?

01:23:17.159 --> 01:23:19.393
Remember, Bob is in no pain.

01:23:20.229 --> 01:23:22.096
He's not feeling any pain.

01:23:22.098 --> 01:23:25.065
We're now going to
shut off the ventilator...

01:23:25.067 --> 01:23:26.533
and then remove the hose.

01:23:27.570 --> 01:23:28.736
It's okay.

01:23:28.738 --> 01:23:30.170
Comfort each other.

01:23:31.474 --> 01:23:32.539
Comfort him.

01:24:49.552 --> 01:24:53.087
Guys, we're going over
to Dawn's, okay?

01:24:53.089 --> 01:24:55.155
- Right.
- Take your time.

01:24:56.158 --> 01:24:58.158
I love you.

01:24:58.160 --> 01:24:59.493
- Love you.
- Love you.

01:25:06.469 --> 01:25:09.136
Could somebody
close his eyes, please?

01:25:09.138 --> 01:25:10.370
Yeah, of course.

01:25:28.724 --> 01:25:30.190
Well.

01:25:35.197 --> 01:25:37.397
You do it. I-I can't do it.

01:25:51.213 --> 01:25:54.214
You know, they took him
away so quick, you know?

01:25:54.216 --> 01:25:56.283
I didn't get a chance
to say goodbye.

01:26:06.929 --> 01:26:10.531
Hey, Dad. Uh...

01:26:13.335 --> 01:26:15.335
Hey, if you're
floating around in here,

01:26:15.337 --> 01:26:17.905
you know, and looking down
or something,

01:26:17.907 --> 01:26:21.742
everything's gonna be okay.
We're gonna take care of Dawn...

01:26:21.744 --> 01:26:23.310
and the dogs.

01:26:23.946 --> 01:26:25.512
They're gonna be fine.

01:26:25.514 --> 01:26:28.782
Oh, and, um, got
a little surprise for you.

01:26:28.784 --> 01:26:31.752
Drumroll.
You're a grandfather again.

01:26:33.522 --> 01:26:36.957
Yeah, it turns out I have a kid.

01:26:36.959 --> 01:26:39.326
- What? Shut up!
- Yeah. I have a kid, it's...

01:26:39.328 --> 01:26:41.395
It's a long story. It's Sue Deever.
It's a whole thing.

01:26:41.397 --> 01:26:46.433
I'll tell you about it, but...
I'm a dad.

01:26:47.403 --> 01:26:49.303
Can you believe it? It's unreal.

01:26:49.972 --> 01:26:52.606
But, um, yeah, he's seven.

01:26:53.642 --> 01:26:55.809
His name's Devon.

01:26:56.812 --> 01:26:58.612
My God, he is so beautiful.

01:27:01.217 --> 01:27:02.816
He's a beautiful boy.

01:27:08.524 --> 01:27:09.623
I'm, uh...

01:27:11.227 --> 01:27:12.659
I'm gonna make a go of it.

01:27:13.829 --> 01:27:15.362
I'm gonna raise him.

01:27:19.501 --> 01:27:22.636
I'm gonna make something
of my life.

01:27:27.977 --> 01:27:29.643
Because I want
to make you proud.

01:27:32.848 --> 01:27:34.514
I want to make you proud, Dad.

01:27:40.589 --> 01:27:41.622
Bye, Dad.

01:27:54.336 --> 01:27:56.903
- How'd I do?
- Good. Just honest.

01:27:56.905 --> 01:27:58.472
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it was beautiful.

01:27:58.474 --> 01:28:00.307
- Your dad would have...
- I scared everybody.

01:28:00.309 --> 01:28:04.411
I did scare them. My Dad would not
have liked this service at all.

01:28:04.413 --> 01:28:05.579
- Edward?
- Um...

01:28:05.581 --> 01:28:07.314
- Oh, hello, Father.
- Mm-hmm.

01:28:07.316 --> 01:28:10.417
Listen. I apologize about
the whole coffin thing.

01:28:10.419 --> 01:28:12.786
- That was, uh...
- It's okay. I understand.

01:28:12.788 --> 01:28:14.021
Yeah.

01:28:14.023 --> 01:28:16.556
Then again, you have
a hell of a left hook.

01:28:16.558 --> 01:28:18.525
At the hospital, you just...

01:28:18.527 --> 01:28:22.029
I apologize for that.
I have a temper. We're not saints.

01:28:22.031 --> 01:28:25.032
I was a drunk prick.
I-I apologize.

01:28:25.034 --> 01:28:27.601
But, if it will make you
feel any better, uh,

01:28:27.603 --> 01:28:29.736
three Hail Mary's and a
benediction, and you're gonna...

01:28:29.738 --> 01:28:31.638
I'm kidding. I kid.

01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:34.574
I don't have a very good sense of humor.
But God does.

01:28:35.644 --> 01:28:36.943
Thank you for everything,
Father.

01:28:36.945 --> 01:28:38.545
I'm gonna miss your father.

01:28:38.547 --> 01:28:40.547
Yeah. Listen,
no offense to the parish,

01:28:40.549 --> 01:28:43.617
but the potato salad and
lemonade ain't cutting it,

01:28:43.619 --> 01:28:46.019
so I booked Bentleys downtown.

01:28:46.021 --> 01:28:48.755
Great. I could use a drink or two.
I'll see you there.

01:28:48.757 --> 01:28:50.457
Derek. Devon.

01:28:50.459 --> 01:28:52.826
- Not so close to the street!
- Oh, shit! Crazy.

01:28:52.828 --> 01:28:55.028
- Hey.
- She's a crazy person.

01:28:55.030 --> 01:28:56.430
- Oh.
- Oh.

01:28:56.432 --> 01:28:58.432
Is, uh, that my new nephew
out there?

01:28:58.434 --> 01:29:00.000
- What do you mean "nephew"?
- Hey, listen.

01:29:00.002 --> 01:29:02.803
He should meet his father
before he meets his uncles.

01:29:02.805 --> 01:29:04.638
- All right? Just...
- Whose father?

01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:06.406
- Are you somebody's father?
- Could you please?

01:29:06.408 --> 01:29:07.507
- Are you kidding?
- Honey, did you...

01:29:07.509 --> 01:29:08.809
- No!
- Did you tell him?

01:29:08.811 --> 01:29:10.610
I thought we were gonna
do one thing at a time.

01:29:10.612 --> 01:29:11.712
I didn't say anything at all.

01:29:11.714 --> 01:29:14.414
- Easy, screamie.
- Hi, sweetheart.

01:29:14.416 --> 01:29:16.483
- I love you, little brother.
- I know. I know.

01:29:18.387 --> 01:29:20.087
- Timothy. Oh.
- That's done.

01:29:20.089 --> 01:29:21.488
- It's done.
- Life moves on.

01:29:22.124 --> 01:29:23.957
Who's next?

01:29:23.959 --> 01:29:25.459
- Honey.
- Who's next, indeed.

01:29:25.461 --> 01:29:26.760
- Next?
- Hey, buddy.

01:29:28.897 --> 01:29:31.765
Sweetie? Diane? Please?

01:29:31.767 --> 01:29:32.767
- Hi.
- This is Bernie.

01:29:34.002 --> 01:29:35.869
- Hi, Bernie. How are you?
- Hi.

01:29:35.871 --> 01:29:38.038
- Everybody loved Bob.
- Oh.

01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:39.439
I cried through the whole thing.

01:29:39.441 --> 01:29:40.607
Oh, you're from
the neighborhood?

01:29:40.609 --> 01:29:41.842
Thank you.

01:29:41.844 --> 01:29:44.578
- He's a hugger.
- You're a hugger.

01:29:44.580 --> 01:29:46.580
I'm sorry.

01:29:46.582 --> 01:29:48.582
- He's a hugger.
- I'm sorry.

01:29:48.584 --> 01:29:50.417
- Okay.
- It's all right.

01:29:50.419 --> 01:29:53.520
We're gonna meet you downtown.
Um, Bernie's gonna drive me.

01:29:53.522 --> 01:29:54.788
- Oh, he is? Okay.
- Yes. We'll see you there.

01:29:54.790 --> 01:29:56.123
All right, we'll see you
at Bentleys.

01:29:56.125 --> 01:29:57.791
- See you there.
- Bye. See you, guys.

01:29:57.793 --> 01:30:00.194
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:30:00.195 --> 01:30:02.596
Um, I'm gonna get the little
monsters out of here, okay?

01:30:02.598 --> 01:30:03.864
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:06.433
Bye.

01:30:07.536 --> 01:30:09.770
Well, well, well.

01:30:09.772 --> 01:30:11.872
- What was that all about?
- Just, uh, nothing.

01:30:11.874 --> 01:30:14.007
Well, then nothing
is blushing, I see.

01:30:14.009 --> 01:30:17.010
- I think I am blushing.
- You are blushing. I like it.

01:30:18.013 --> 01:30:19.413
Oh, my God.

01:30:20.549 --> 01:30:22.916
What are you doing?
This is a funeral home.

01:30:22.918 --> 01:30:25.585
- Oh, my God.
- Okay. That's it. That's it.

01:30:25.587 --> 01:30:27.921
Come on. Bring it here.
Bring it in here.

01:30:27.923 --> 01:30:31.158
You guys are having
way too much fun!

01:30:31.160 --> 01:30:33.460
All right. Here.
You take the ball.

01:30:33.462 --> 01:30:35.762
- Sorry, Mr. Eddie.
- What are you apologizing for?

01:30:35.764 --> 01:30:37.531
We've been careful
about the cemetery

01:30:37.533 --> 01:30:39.866
and not to run on anybody
while they're sleeping.

01:30:39.868 --> 01:30:40.868
Like you said.

01:30:42.771 --> 01:30:44.538
You're a smart kid. You listen.

01:30:44.540 --> 01:30:48.909
Hey, how about you stop
calling me Mr. Eddie...

01:30:48.911 --> 01:30:50.677
Um, that's...

01:30:52.481 --> 01:30:55.515
And you call me...
Peyton Manning

01:30:55.517 --> 01:30:58.051
and you line up
and get ready to go, boys.

01:30:58.053 --> 01:31:00.086
That's it! Line up. On Omaha!

01:31:00.088 --> 01:31:01.488
- Omaha.
- Omaha.

01:31:01.490 --> 01:31:03.723
Three huts. Hang on.
Are you ready?

01:31:03.725 --> 01:31:05.225
- Yeah.
- Long bomb.

01:31:05.227 --> 01:31:07.494
- Okay.
- Ready?

01:31:07.496 --> 01:31:08.695
Come on with these huts!

01:31:08.697 --> 01:31:09.963
Go long!

01:31:09.965 --> 01:31:11.164
All the way!

01:31:11.166 --> 01:31:12.899
- Go! Go! Go!
- Run!

01:31:12.901 --> 01:31:13.934
Yes! Here we go!

01:31:16.038 --> 01:31:18.138
- Oh! Oh!
- Oh!
