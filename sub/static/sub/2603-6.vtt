00:09.609 --> 00:10.910
Harvey, I don't need
a perp walk

00:10.911 --> 00:11.940
or a front page headline.

00:12.008 --> 00:13.173
I just want the person
responsible.

00:13.241 --> 00:15.176
Then hand me the deal
we just negotiated

00:15.244 --> 00:17.643
and justice will be served.

00:17.711 --> 00:21.143
You know what, if this were
anyone else but you,

00:21.211 --> 00:23.380
I wouldn't even be giving
the courtesy of this meeting.

00:23.451 --> 00:26.597
Becky, we're both benefiting
from this.

00:26.665 --> 00:28.032
You've got nothing
on my client.

00:28.099 --> 00:30.668
And I'm gonna help you get
the person responsible.

00:30.736 --> 00:31.973
So let me just go do that?

00:32.040 --> 00:34.813
You better make sure
Miss Stone signs this.

00:34.880 --> 00:36.383
Otherwise, we don't have a deal.

00:36.453 --> 00:37.620
How long
have we known each other?

00:37.687 --> 00:38.721
Since you were
in the D.A.'s office.

00:38.789 --> 00:41.359
Then you know
we'll have a deal.

00:43.532 --> 00:47.369
Talk to ya.

00:54.048 --> 00:56.018
How'd it go
with the Department of Justice?

00:56.085 --> 00:56.954
Follow me,
you'll find out.

00:57.021 --> 00:58.555
I get to sit in?

00:58.623 --> 00:59.956
With your head down
and your mouth shut.

01:00.024 --> 01:01.558
This isn't a usual--
Ah.

01:01.626 --> 01:02.928
- What are you doing?
- Quick.

01:02.996 --> 01:04.163
Act like you're telling me
something important.

01:04.230 --> 01:05.131
I am telling you
something important.

01:05.199 --> 01:06.734
And then after the injunction,

01:06.802 --> 01:09.506
you know, both parties decided
to reassess--

01:09.574 --> 01:10.641
my God.

01:10.708 --> 01:11.975
That woman with Rachel,

01:12.043 --> 01:13.678
I took the LSATs for her
a couple years ago.

01:13.745 --> 01:14.947
If she saw me,
she could blow my cover.

01:15.014 --> 01:17.083
Oh, really?
And how would that go?

01:17.151 --> 01:19.185
"Excuse me, when I was cheating
for my LSATs,

01:19.253 --> 01:20.687
that was the guy
who took the test for me"?

01:20.755 --> 01:22.190
Come on.

01:22.258 --> 01:23.324
It could go down like that.

01:23.392 --> 01:24.792
You don't know.
People say things.

01:24.860 --> 01:27.195
Miss Stone, correct me
if any of this is wrong,

01:27.263 --> 01:28.596
but you and I both know
it's not.

01:28.664 --> 01:30.598
Please address me
and not my client, Mr. Specter.

01:30.666 --> 01:32.433
You mean your client
who purchased $10 million

01:32.501 --> 01:33.535
in Lunardi Pharmaceuticals

01:33.602 --> 01:35.336
and then a day later

01:35.404 --> 01:37.204
word of their FDA approval
got out

01:37.272 --> 01:39.106
and the stock shot up
to $30 million?

01:39.174 --> 01:40.374
She purchased that stock
for your clients,

01:40.442 --> 01:41.942
Burt Kimball
and Dean Morello,

01:42.010 --> 01:43.811
based on a tip sheet
handed out by your clients.

01:43.878 --> 01:46.147
An allegation that tainted
their reputation,

01:46.215 --> 01:48.483
yet the D.O.J. looked into it
and found nothing.

01:48.551 --> 01:49.952
That doesn't mean
it didn't happen.

01:50.020 --> 01:53.155
I'll turn your client over
in person, no handcuffs.

01:53.223 --> 01:54.591
It'll be a country club prison.

01:54.658 --> 01:56.661
And I'll make sure
she's processed

01:56.728 --> 01:58.296
as gently as possible
as long as she admits

01:58.363 --> 02:00.098
that she made this trade
of her own accord.

02:00.165 --> 02:02.934
It's a crappy deal
wrapped in pretty paper.

02:03.002 --> 02:05.404
Why aren't we dealing
with the Department of Justice?

02:05.472 --> 02:06.972
Because the D.O.J. wanted
to put you behind bars

02:07.040 --> 02:11.979
for seven years, and I got 'em
down to 11 months.

02:12.047 --> 02:13.781
Look, it's a great deal.

02:13.849 --> 02:17.018
You're gonna sign it, you're
gonna serve your year in prison,

02:17.085 --> 02:18.853
and every night when you climb
into your bunk,

02:18.921 --> 02:20.221
you're gonna thank
your lucky stars

02:20.289 --> 02:23.726
that Harvey Specter
negotiated on your behalf.

02:29.200 --> 02:30.534
Nobody's ever gonna
believe me,

02:30.601 --> 02:31.702
and I don't have the resources

02:31.770 --> 02:34.473
to fight this thing
forever.

02:34.540 --> 02:37.009
So I'll sign
the goddamn deal.

02:40.981 --> 02:43.416
But I'm not thanking anybody.

02:48.023 --> 02:51.793
Harvey, you came through.

02:51.861 --> 02:54.530
My company's reputation
means everything to me.

02:54.597 --> 02:56.732
Thank you.

02:56.800 --> 02:57.900
So I trust we won't be hearing

02:57.968 --> 02:59.969
from the Department of Justice
again?

03:00.037 --> 03:01.504
Unless you plan
on inviting them

03:01.571 --> 03:04.073
to the company's
Christmas party, Bert, no.

03:04.141 --> 03:06.943
I told Morello
you could fix this for us.

03:07.010 --> 03:08.144
Thank you, Harvey.

03:11.982 --> 03:14.250
Reality's starting
to sink in.

03:14.318 --> 03:16.352
Gabby's a little wound up
right now.

03:16.420 --> 03:17.754
Let's give her a minute.

03:17.821 --> 03:19.822
I've got the pretty papers
in my office

03:19.890 --> 03:22.425
for you to look over.

03:22.493 --> 03:24.394
Keep an eye on her.

03:32.304 --> 03:34.239
You here to make sure
I don't change my mind

03:34.306 --> 03:37.242
about the deal?
No.

03:37.310 --> 03:39.145
Would you?

03:39.212 --> 03:42.916
You know,
my father was a teacher.

03:42.983 --> 03:44.884
He worked hard,
followed the rules.

03:44.952 --> 03:47.287
Last year, the district
cut his pension

03:47.354 --> 03:48.722
to save their budget.

03:48.789 --> 03:51.591
I went to Wall Street
so I could make some money

03:51.659 --> 03:57.430
before getting
into teaching myself.

03:57.498 --> 03:58.865
I never thought
I'd have to worry

03:58.933 --> 04:01.234
if they let
convicted felons teach.

04:04.939 --> 04:06.773
Can I get you some water
or something?

04:09.912 --> 04:13.281
Oh...

04:13.348 --> 04:15.349
I'm just gonna get you
some water.

04:21.290 --> 04:22.523
Hey.
I got it.

04:22.591 --> 04:24.224
Thanks.

04:24.292 --> 04:27.261
So that girl
you were with earlier,

04:27.329 --> 04:28.463
she a friend of yours?
Theresa, yeah.

04:28.530 --> 04:30.131
She used to be a paralegal here.

04:30.199 --> 04:31.966
We were pretty close.

04:32.033 --> 04:33.267
She worked
at Pearson, Hardman?

04:33.335 --> 04:34.702
Mm-hmm.

04:34.770 --> 04:36.704
And I just had the unique
pleasure of giving her

04:36.772 --> 04:39.273
the summer intern tour
for prospective employees.

04:39.341 --> 04:40.474
- Really?
- Yeah.

04:40.542 --> 04:41.709
She's in her second year
of Harvard Law,

04:41.777 --> 04:43.177
meeting with the partners
as we speak.

04:43.245 --> 04:44.946
- Huh.
- I know.

04:45.013 --> 04:46.614
We used to do everything
together.

04:46.682 --> 04:50.184
And now, if she gets this job,
she will technically be my boss.

04:50.252 --> 04:51.686
Oh, God.

04:51.754 --> 04:52.954
I'm so sorry, Rachel.

04:53.022 --> 04:54.456
Do you need to talk about it?

04:54.523 --> 04:57.158
No. Not now.
Thanks.

04:57.226 --> 04:58.226
Oh, no, no.
No.

04:58.294 --> 05:00.329
What?

05:00.396 --> 05:02.864
She's gone.

05:38.141 --> 05:39.408
I was trying to be helpful.

05:39.476 --> 05:41.344
You were very helpful
to her.

05:41.411 --> 05:42.544
You didn't see her, Harvey.
She was scared.

05:42.612 --> 05:44.012
She was a wreck.

05:44.080 --> 05:45.180
Maybe that had to do
with the fact that she was about

05:45.248 --> 05:46.782
to go to prison
for 11 months.

05:46.850 --> 05:48.384
I think she was having the
reaction of an innocent woman.

05:48.452 --> 05:49.685
And what was telling you that?

05:49.753 --> 05:51.220
Your years
of investigative experience?

05:51.288 --> 05:53.923
You know, I just--I listened
to her, that's all.

05:53.991 --> 05:55.425
Let me tell you something,
okay.

05:55.492 --> 05:56.592
Just because a pretty girl
tells you a story

05:56.660 --> 05:58.194
doesn't mean it's true.

05:58.262 --> 05:59.595
If she'd gone to trial,

05:59.663 --> 06:01.164
the burden of proof would be
on the prosecution,

06:01.231 --> 06:02.531
yet her own lawyer

06:02.599 --> 06:03.899
told her to take the deal.

06:03.967 --> 06:05.301
Not to mention
that innocent people

06:05.369 --> 06:09.004
don't run.

06:09.072 --> 06:10.873
I think this fell out
of her purse.

06:10.940 --> 06:13.642
I found it here.

06:13.710 --> 06:15.778
Why are you
telling me this now?

06:15.846 --> 06:17.146
Because you were mad
at me before.

06:17.214 --> 06:18.448
So your answer to that

06:18.515 --> 06:20.249
is to delay giving me
important information?

06:20.317 --> 06:21.885
Well, when you put it
like that.

06:21.953 --> 06:24.054
Okay, I got to smooth things
over with the D.O.J.

06:24.122 --> 06:25.990
That phone is our only lead.

06:26.057 --> 06:27.859

Becky, there's been
a slight hiccup

06:41.005 --> 06:42.371
on the Gabby Stone business.

06:42.439 --> 06:43.473
I don't want to hear
about any hiccups.

06:43.540 --> 06:44.674
Did she sign the deal
or not?

06:44.742 --> 06:46.175
Well, she was about to.

06:46.243 --> 06:48.144
My associate left her alone
for a second,

06:48.212 --> 06:49.812
and she took off.

06:49.880 --> 06:51.147
Gabby Stone's in the wind?

06:51.215 --> 06:54.483
"In the wind"?
Really?

06:54.550 --> 06:56.185
The woman
isn't a world-class felon.

06:56.252 --> 06:58.053
She'll turn up.

06:58.121 --> 06:59.721
Well, it better be soon,
or the deal's off the table

06:59.789 --> 07:01.924
and I'm going
after your clients.

07:01.991 --> 07:03.092
That's funny.

07:03.159 --> 07:04.493
I don't think so.

07:04.560 --> 07:06.261
The SEC decided
they had no case,

07:06.329 --> 07:07.796
and their burden of proof
is lower.

07:07.864 --> 07:09.564
If you had something
on my clients,

07:09.632 --> 07:10.933
you would have charged them
already.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.468
Harvey, I went out
on a limb for you.

07:13.536 --> 07:14.970
You make me look bad

you'll regret it.

Mr. Reger.

- Come on, Reger.

08:09.392 --> 08:11.593
Bradley Reger!

08:14.397 --> 08:16.131
Sorry, can I help you?

about the investigation

08:19.737 --> 08:23.573
regarding Gabby Stone.

08:23.641 --> 08:24.774
Are you
with the Department of Justice?

08:24.842 --> 08:27.544
I...

08:27.612 --> 08:30.147
I have several questions
for you.

08:31.515 --> 08:33.850
Did you help Gabby
when she was charged

08:33.918 --> 08:36.186
with insider trading?

08:36.253 --> 08:37.654
Of course I did.

08:37.721 --> 08:39.789
She wasn't just a trader.
She was my friend.

08:39.857 --> 08:41.524
I recommended a lawyer
and let her borrow some cash

08:41.592 --> 08:42.558
after you guys
froze her account.

08:42.626 --> 08:43.760
That was Henderson.

08:43.828 --> 08:45.395
He's a stickler
for procedure.

08:45.463 --> 08:46.563
Tell me, when was the last time
you saw her?

08:46.631 --> 08:48.866
Bradley, let me inform you

08:48.933 --> 08:50.434
that withholding knowledge
of the whereabouts

08:50.502 --> 08:52.403
of a known fugitive
is a federal offense.

08:52.471 --> 08:55.072
Do you understand me?

08:55.140 --> 08:56.540
Gabby came in here
20 minutes ago.

08:56.608 --> 08:58.676
She asked to borrow my keycard
to Morello Assets offices,

08:58.743 --> 09:00.044
and I gave it to her.

09:00.111 --> 09:03.781
Well, the department
appreciates your honesty.

09:03.848 --> 09:06.483
Oh, and, Mr. Reger, put
a little arc in your jump shot,

09:06.550 --> 09:07.817
all right?
If poor shooting were a crime,

09:07.885 --> 09:09.385
I'd be forced to arrest you
right here.

09:09.453 --> 09:10.854
It's embarrassing.

09:10.921 --> 09:11.988
Go get 'em.

09:16.693 --> 09:20.998
Harvey, I know
where she is.

09:22.867 --> 09:25.603
What are you doing here?
I told you I'd get her.

09:25.671 --> 09:27.171
And I would let you.

09:27.239 --> 09:28.773
I just wanted to make sure
she didn't get away again.

09:28.841 --> 09:31.142
The water was right
outside the room, okay?

09:31.210 --> 09:33.444
And you said innocent people
don't run.

09:33.512 --> 09:35.579
Do guilty people run back
to the scene of the crime?

09:35.647 --> 09:37.014
You don't know
what she's doing.

09:37.081 --> 09:38.982
She could be planning
on taking a baseball bat

09:39.050 --> 09:40.550
to all these computers
for all we know.

09:47.657 --> 09:50.358
Gabby, what are you doing?

09:50.426 --> 09:51.726
That stock
was on my tip sheet.

09:51.794 --> 09:53.227
It was on mine.

09:53.295 --> 09:55.430
If I could find
that tip sheet,

09:55.497 --> 09:57.398
I could prove my innocence.

09:57.466 --> 10:01.570
Is this what guilty people do?

10:01.637 --> 10:03.238
I know
they're your clients,

10:03.306 --> 10:04.606
but can you help me,
please?

10:04.674 --> 10:05.774
I'm sorry.

10:05.842 --> 10:07.275
You can either come with us,

10:07.343 --> 10:09.945
or we'll have the Department
of Justice bring you in.

10:20.188 --> 10:21.655
So I meant to ask you,

10:21.723 --> 10:23.390
how did your friend's interview
go yesterday?

10:23.458 --> 10:26.026
Theresa?
She didn't get the internship.

10:26.094 --> 10:28.428
So how do you feel about that?

10:28.496 --> 10:30.063
To be honest,
I'm relieved.

10:30.131 --> 10:31.598
I mean, she would have been
a daily reminder

10:31.665 --> 10:33.032
of what I couldn't do,

10:33.100 --> 10:34.167
that I'll never score
high enough

10:34.235 --> 10:35.669
on the LSATs
or get into law school.

10:35.737 --> 10:37.605
You know,
that doesn't have to be true.

10:37.672 --> 10:39.240
It is.
I need to accept

10:39.307 --> 10:40.541
that I will always be
a paralegal

10:40.609 --> 10:42.009
because of this stupid test.

10:52.989 --> 10:54.790
I had a hard time
sleeping last night.

10:54.858 --> 10:56.058
You want to know why?
No.

10:56.126 --> 10:57.526
Because Gabby Stone
is innocent.

10:57.594 --> 10:59.195
Oh, I slept like a baby.

10:59.262 --> 11:00.462
I don't think
you believe that.

11:00.529 --> 11:02.030
You think she's innocent too.

11:02.098 --> 11:03.165
You just don't want
to pursue it.

11:03.233 --> 11:04.365
She's not our client.

11:04.433 --> 11:06.301
No, Morello is our client.

11:06.368 --> 11:08.502
And if someone else
in that office is responsible

11:08.570 --> 11:10.571
and they do it again,
won't that put our client

11:10.639 --> 11:11.772
in jeopardy?

11:11.840 --> 11:13.574
Ahh.
Ooh, yep.

11:13.642 --> 11:15.009
I'm right,
and you know it.

11:15.077 --> 11:16.644
And now you have
the responsibility

11:16.712 --> 11:19.548
to investigate.

11:19.616 --> 11:21.617
Did you tell that guy
at the basketball court

11:21.685 --> 11:23.720
that you were an attorney
for the Department of Justice?

11:25.923 --> 11:28.892
Not explicitly.

11:28.960 --> 11:30.894
I mean, people hear
what they want to hear.

11:30.962 --> 11:32.797
I won't impersonate
a federal agent again.

11:32.864 --> 11:35.933
Probably a good idea.

11:36.001 --> 11:38.003
Yeah.

11:48.129 --> 11:50.429
Oh, hey, Mike,
can I give you

11:50.430 --> 11:52.064
my roommate's cat
for the weekend?

11:52.132 --> 11:53.966
Let's get it over with.
I have some actual work to do.

11:54.034 --> 11:55.301
No, no, no,
it's not what you think.

11:55.368 --> 11:56.769
It's just very annoying,

11:56.837 --> 11:58.237
and I figured
if you were looking after it,

11:58.305 --> 11:59.605
the cat's as good as gone,
right?

11:59.673 --> 12:01.874
Gentlemen.

12:01.941 --> 12:03.375
What's going on?

12:03.443 --> 12:05.811
Some sort of shenanigans?

12:05.878 --> 12:07.279
Uh, no, it's nothing.

12:07.347 --> 12:09.047
It's just stuff
between associates.

12:09.115 --> 12:10.315
I said, "What's going on?"

12:10.383 --> 12:13.185
Seth's just giving me
a hard time

12:13.252 --> 12:15.788
for losing Gabby Stone
yesterday.

12:15.855 --> 12:18.056
Oh, but we know
at this firm

12:18.124 --> 12:20.292
that we don't dwell
on our colleagues' mistakes,

12:20.360 --> 12:21.827
right?

12:21.895 --> 12:23.395
I mean,
just because one

12:23.462 --> 12:25.430
of your fellow associates
is incompetent doesn't mean

12:25.497 --> 12:26.731
you have to constantly remind
this moron

12:26.799 --> 12:29.434
what a careless idiot
he really is, right?

12:30.736 --> 12:32.937
You.

12:35.140 --> 12:38.109
Harold, I called you
two nights ago,

12:38.176 --> 12:39.010
and you didn't answer
your phone,

12:39.077 --> 12:40.478
which is really funny,

12:40.545 --> 12:42.079
because you're
a first-year associate,

12:42.147 --> 12:43.647
who's lucky enough
to be working here

12:43.715 --> 12:46.316
at Pearson/Hardman, so, when
I need to get a hold of you,

12:46.384 --> 12:48.619
you will be reachable
at all times.

12:48.686 --> 12:50.154
I don't care
if you're in a coma,

12:50.221 --> 12:51.655
hospital
that's been burning down,

12:51.723 --> 12:53.390
your mother's about to jump
off the Brooklyn Bridge,

12:53.458 --> 12:54.691
you will pick up your phone.

12:54.759 --> 12:55.959
- Absolutely.
- Got it?

12:56.027 --> 12:57.127
Yes.

12:59.830 --> 13:01.597
Okay, thanks.
Can you leave my office, please?

13:07.905 --> 13:10.473
Harvey, once this whole
Morello thing gets fixed,

13:10.541 --> 13:13.209
remind me to be irritated
with you for not billing more

13:13.277 --> 13:15.078
on the Swindon merger.

13:15.146 --> 13:17.314
The fact is mergers
are boring, okay?

13:17.381 --> 13:19.583
Plus, I'm busy.
Also, mergers?

13:19.650 --> 13:20.817
Boring.

13:20.885 --> 13:22.386
How'd you get these?

13:22.454 --> 13:24.789
Oh, you mean tickets to
the Royal Shakespeare Company's

13:24.856 --> 13:25.757
production of <i>King Lear?</i>

13:25.824 --> 13:27.091
This show was sold out

13:27.159 --> 13:28.092
the minute these tickets
went on sale.

13:28.160 --> 13:29.493
I live for <i>King Lear.</i>

13:29.561 --> 13:31.996
- How did you know that?
- It's my job to know that.

13:32.064 --> 13:33.264
But why?

13:33.332 --> 13:36.201
Louis, your billables
are outstanding.

13:36.269 --> 13:39.104
You've landed
three high-profile clients

13:39.172 --> 13:40.873
in a month, and I want
to show you my appreciation.

13:42.375 --> 13:43.809
And I'm very happy
that you're excited.

13:43.877 --> 13:45.910
So should we get dinner
before or after the play?

13:47.781 --> 13:50.148
Uh, um, I-I don't know.

13:50.216 --> 13:51.583
Jessica, do you remember
when we went

13:51.651 --> 13:53.051
to that Yankee game
and you caught that foul ball

13:53.119 --> 13:54.619
and you ate all my nachos?

13:54.687 --> 13:56.054
Did we go to the steakhouse
that night?

13:56.121 --> 13:58.956
Oh, that was a good meal.

13:59.024 --> 14:01.626
That was fun.

14:01.693 --> 14:03.628
Have a good time.

14:03.696 --> 14:06.664
You know what, Louis,
dinner after.

14:06.731 --> 14:08.332
I'll have Norma
make a reservation.

14:08.400 --> 14:11.102
Fantastic.

14:18.477 --> 14:21.712
Dean, Gabby Stone's
still making noises

14:21.780 --> 14:24.015
about these tip sheets.

14:24.082 --> 14:25.883
She insists that she had
a different sheet

14:25.951 --> 14:27.184
on the day she bought Lunardi.

14:27.252 --> 14:28.586
She was lying.

14:28.654 --> 14:30.621
I understand,
but, after she broke

14:30.689 --> 14:31.756
into your offices
last night,

14:31.824 --> 14:33.124
the D.O.J. might be inclined

14:33.192 --> 14:36.661
to start rattling cases again.

14:36.728 --> 14:38.263
So, for the record,

14:38.330 --> 14:39.397
you're telling me the truth,
right?

14:39.465 --> 14:41.600
Harvey,

14:41.667 --> 14:43.001
you work for me,
remember?

14:43.069 --> 14:44.869
Well, as your lawyer,
I need to be able

14:44.937 --> 14:46.771
to tell the D.O.J.
we're all aboveboard.

14:46.839 --> 14:48.339
- Of course.
- So you won't mind

14:48.407 --> 14:49.340
if I look around for myself?

14:49.408 --> 14:50.674
We've had a clean record

14:50.742 --> 14:52.143
for 50 years.

14:52.210 --> 14:56.480
Please, Harvey,
look around.

14:58.450 --> 15:00.284
Why is that
on my desk?

15:00.352 --> 15:02.520
'Cause the LSATs are a week
from Saturday.

15:02.587 --> 15:04.388
Great.
Go away. I'm busy.

15:04.456 --> 15:06.123
There are only four tests
a year, which means,

15:06.191 --> 15:07.424
if you miss this one,
you're gonna have to wait

15:07.491 --> 15:08.525
another three months.
I can do math too,

15:08.593 --> 15:11.161
Good Will Hunting.

15:11.229 --> 15:13.197
When did I say I was ready
to retake the LSATs?

15:13.264 --> 15:14.532
I thought that,
after our talk--

15:14.599 --> 15:15.666
Nothing about our talk
said I'm interested

15:15.734 --> 15:16.801
in bombing the test again.

15:16.869 --> 15:18.169
You're not gonna bomb it
again.

15:18.236 --> 15:19.703
- How do you know?
- Because the first time

15:19.771 --> 15:20.704
you took it,
you were missing

15:20.772 --> 15:22.372
one essential ingredient...

15:22.440 --> 15:23.607
Me.

15:23.674 --> 15:24.741
Not interested.

15:28.913 --> 15:30.247
If I let you help me,

15:30.314 --> 15:31.381
will you leave me alone?

15:31.449 --> 15:32.783
Mm-hmm.

15:32.850 --> 15:35.652
- Okay.
- I'll see you later.

15:35.720 --> 15:37.620
Get excited.

15:37.688 --> 15:42.558
Whoo-hoo.

15:42.626 --> 15:45.494
Hey, I forget, why are we
looking into Gabby Stone again?

15:45.562 --> 15:47.396
Oh, right,
because I said she's innocent,

15:47.464 --> 15:48.664
and now you agree with me.

15:48.732 --> 15:49.732
No, I don't agree
with you

15:49.799 --> 15:51.266
that she's innocent,

15:51.334 --> 15:53.401
but, if there's even
the slightest chance

15:53.469 --> 15:54.870
that someone else
is involved,

15:54.937 --> 15:56.871
they're putting
the whole company at risk,

15:56.939 --> 15:58.239
and I can't have that.

15:58.307 --> 16:01.308
Okay, so you disagree
with what we agree about?

16:01.376 --> 16:02.643
Oh, I'll agree with that.

16:06.716 --> 16:08.617
I don't feel sorry
for Gabby Stone at all.

16:08.685 --> 16:09.618
Because?

16:09.686 --> 16:10.652
I found her.

16:10.720 --> 16:12.087
I was her immediate supervisor.

16:12.155 --> 16:13.523
I nurtured her.

16:13.590 --> 16:15.925
Then she tries to cheat
and give us a bad name.

16:15.993 --> 16:17.960
How commonplace would you say
cheating is here?

16:18.028 --> 16:20.096
It's not. It's not the kind
of shop we run.

16:20.164 --> 16:21.932
So when Miss Stone
made the trade

16:21.999 --> 16:23.366
and the investment tripled
in value,

16:23.434 --> 16:24.634
you weren't suspicious?

16:24.702 --> 16:25.602
My job's not to worry
about the traders

16:25.669 --> 16:27.136
that are making money.

16:27.204 --> 16:30.807
My job's to worry
about the traders who aren't.

16:59.603 --> 17:01.638
So how exactly
does the tip sheet system work?

17:01.705 --> 17:03.606
Our technical analyst
predicts stocks

17:03.674 --> 17:05.907
that are likely to have
larger-than-expected volatility.

17:05.976 --> 17:07.843
These predictions are handed out
to our traders

17:07.911 --> 17:10.712
on a daily basis in the form
of a tip sheet.

17:10.780 --> 17:13.115
All these traders
get the same tip sheet?

17:13.183 --> 17:14.082
Exactly.
They're printed on red paper,

17:14.150 --> 17:15.383
so they can't be copied.

17:15.451 --> 17:16.917
Every trader is responsible
for returning

17:16.986 --> 17:18.720
their sheet
at the end of the day,

17:18.788 --> 17:20.253
so they can be shredded.
So no records exist?

17:20.321 --> 17:21.656
We keep electronic copies.

17:21.723 --> 17:23.390
I'll need to see those copies
for the last year.

17:23.458 --> 17:24.525
I thought you might.

17:24.592 --> 17:25.992
I'm assuming you own a computer.

17:26.060 --> 17:27.493
One more thing.

17:27.561 --> 17:28.729
I'll need to see a list
of all the trades

17:28.797 --> 17:30.330
Morello Assets made
in the last year.

17:30.398 --> 17:32.866
Well, I can't give you that.

17:32.934 --> 17:34.067
Why not?

17:34.135 --> 17:36.102
Tip sheets have expired.

17:36.170 --> 17:39.673
But our current positions--
that's proprietary information.

17:39.740 --> 17:41.675
And I can't release that
on just your say-so.

17:41.743 --> 17:42.943
That's not a request.

17:43.011 --> 17:44.411
We need to protect the company.

17:44.479 --> 17:45.846
And we're covered
under attorney-client privilege.

17:45.914 --> 17:48.382
And I'm telling you
I'm not giving you sh--.

17:48.450 --> 17:51.151
You think I don't know what
attorney-client privilege is?

17:51.219 --> 17:53.588
You know, you corporate lawyers
look down your noses at us

17:53.655 --> 17:55.656
because we didn't go
to Ivy League schools.

17:55.724 --> 17:57.625
Just because I don't have
a fancy degree

17:57.693 --> 17:58.826
doesn't mean you get
to come into my house

17:58.894 --> 18:00.394
and order me around.

18:00.461 --> 18:01.762
And you go whine
to Morello

18:01.829 --> 18:04.831
and I'll knock you on your ass
like the pussy you are.

18:04.899 --> 18:08.469
Well, Sam, I'm sorry
that you feel that way,

18:08.537 --> 18:10.605
but I've been working
for your boss Dean Morello

18:10.672 --> 18:11.739
for a very long time,

18:11.807 --> 18:13.374
and let me tell you something.

18:13.442 --> 18:15.143
You try to stonewall me,

18:15.211 --> 18:17.379
you'll be out on the street
in less than a week.

18:17.447 --> 18:18.781
As for the other stuff,

18:18.849 --> 18:21.251
do I think
that I'm smarter than you?

18:21.318 --> 18:22.585
You're damn right I do.

18:22.653 --> 18:24.488
But if you think that means

18:24.555 --> 18:27.257
that I can't kick your ass
up and down this floor,

18:27.325 --> 18:30.160
take a swing
and see what happens.

18:32.030 --> 18:35.366
I didn't think so.

18:38.237 --> 18:40.104
That was amazing.

18:40.172 --> 18:42.673
It was like he was Mr. T
and you were Rocky,

18:42.741 --> 18:44.975
but not like Rocky at the
beginning when he was all scared

18:45.043 --> 18:46.077
of Mr. T,
but at the end,

18:46.144 --> 18:47.411
when he was all like,

18:47.479 --> 18:48.913
"Ooh, give it your best shot."

18:48.980 --> 18:50.147
You know?

18:50.215 --> 18:52.683
"Adrian!"
Yes!

18:52.751 --> 18:54.885
That's funny, but you might
want to wipe that grin

18:54.953 --> 18:55.987
off your face.
What? Why?

18:56.054 --> 18:57.555
Because without those trades,

18:57.622 --> 18:59.123
we don't have sh--,
and your little girlfriend's

18:59.191 --> 19:00.491
gonna rot in jail.

19:00.559 --> 19:01.425
And by the way, you got to work
on your Stallone.

19:01.493 --> 19:02.793
You need a lower register.

19:02.861 --> 19:04.362
"Uhh."

19:04.429 --> 19:06.063
That was
an incredible Stallone.

19:06.131 --> 19:07.832
I've been doing that since I was
a kid, and you can't touch it.

19:07.900 --> 19:09.200
- "Uhh."
- Don't do that

19:09.267 --> 19:10.501
with food in your mouth.
No, I swallowed it.

19:10.569 --> 19:13.104
"Uhh."
There's food in your mouth.

19:13.172 --> 19:14.338
- "Adrian."
- That's disgusting.

19:16.708 --> 19:18.843
Come on.
You got this one.

19:18.911 --> 19:21.079
It's "A".

19:21.146 --> 19:23.248
No, it's "C".

19:23.315 --> 19:24.983
Actually, it's "D".
It's definitely "D".

19:25.050 --> 19:26.451
Final answer?

19:26.518 --> 19:28.786
Yes, "D".

19:28.854 --> 19:30.187
It's "A".

19:31.389 --> 19:33.190
Rachel, you got to remember

19:33.258 --> 19:35.125
they're asking why the argument
is most vulnerable.

19:35.193 --> 19:36.594
I can make the case

19:36.661 --> 19:37.928
that they're
all vulnerable arguments.

19:37.996 --> 19:39.663
You could, but your
first instinct was "A".

19:39.731 --> 19:40.831
You got to go with your gut.
Right.

19:40.898 --> 19:42.232
So what if my gut can find

19:42.300 --> 19:43.333
the exception
where "A" is wrong.

19:43.401 --> 19:44.367
What am I supposed
to do then?

19:44.435 --> 19:45.535
- You ignore it.
- I can't.

19:45.603 --> 19:46.503
That's easier said than done.

19:46.571 --> 19:48.005
The test isn't trying

19:48.073 --> 19:49.741
to trick you, Rachel.
But sometimes it is, Mike.

19:49.809 --> 19:51.643
- Well, you got to let that go.
- I can't.

19:51.711 --> 19:52.611
- Why not?
- 'Cause I don't want

19:52.679 --> 19:56.182
to get any questions wrong.

19:56.250 --> 19:58.151
Okay.
I think we found your problem.

19:58.218 --> 20:00.987
You're so afraid of getting
fooled by a few trick questions

20:01.055 --> 20:02.422
that you're letting it mess
you up with all the other ones.

20:02.490 --> 20:04.457
Look, Rachel, you want
to get into Harvard,

20:04.525 --> 20:06.592
you need a 170.
Okay?

20:06.660 --> 20:08.961
If you let a few
of these trick questions go,

20:09.029 --> 20:10.562
you're gonna be fine.

20:10.630 --> 20:12.698
But if you keep trying
to be perfect,

20:12.766 --> 20:13.833
you're gonna overthink
this whole thing.

20:13.900 --> 20:16.135
You're gonna end up
with a 130.

20:16.202 --> 20:17.969
Rachel.

20:18.037 --> 20:19.905
Nobody gets
all the trick questions.

20:19.972 --> 20:21.540
What about you?

20:21.607 --> 20:23.942
First grade,

20:24.010 --> 20:25.944
they gave me
an achievement test.

20:26.012 --> 20:28.146
I scored in the 99th percentile,

20:28.214 --> 20:30.215
so they kept giving me
achievement tests

20:30.283 --> 20:32.851
all the way up
to the eighth grade level.

20:32.919 --> 20:35.187
And I kept getting
in the 99th percentile

20:35.255 --> 20:37.089
with every one of 'em.

20:37.157 --> 20:39.092
You couldn't get the 100th?

20:39.160 --> 20:41.295
There is no 100th.

20:43.998 --> 20:47.934
Next question.
Come on.

20:48.002 --> 20:49.435
<i>King Lear.</i>

20:49.503 --> 20:50.903
I happen to like <i>King Lear.</i>

20:50.971 --> 20:52.939
And unlike some people
I know,

20:53.006 --> 20:55.642
Louis's references don't begin
and end with <i>Top Gun.</i>

20:55.709 --> 20:57.510
Hey, I love Louis,
and I don't care

20:57.578 --> 21:00.413
what you say,
I am not leaving my wingman.

21:00.481 --> 21:02.782
See, that's funny,
because that's from <i>Top Gun.</i>

21:02.850 --> 21:06.419
He's a wild card.
Flies by the seat of his pants.

21:06.487 --> 21:08.889
Think I can't quote
<i>Top Gun.</i>

21:08.957 --> 21:10.090
Get the hell out of here.

21:10.158 --> 21:11.391
Oh, that was good.

21:11.459 --> 21:13.394
Hey, Mike.

21:13.461 --> 21:14.695
Burt Kimball's coming
to see me.

21:14.763 --> 21:15.896
I need you in the meeting.

21:15.964 --> 21:17.198
Oh, the number two
at Morello?

21:17.266 --> 21:18.733
Bet he's coming
to yell at you

21:18.801 --> 21:20.602
after your big showdown there
yesterday.

21:20.670 --> 21:21.937
If you need me,
I got your back.

21:22.005 --> 21:25.074
Thinking about finally going
to law school?

21:25.142 --> 21:27.410
Oh, no,
I'm helping Rachel study.

21:27.477 --> 21:28.844
Pretty paralegal.
Got it.

21:28.912 --> 21:30.546
Okay.
It's not like that.

21:30.614 --> 21:32.048
It's exactly like that.

21:32.116 --> 21:33.483
Oh, that reminds me.

21:33.550 --> 21:35.885
How did you manage
to take the LSATs for a woman?

21:35.953 --> 21:37.020
What do you mean?

21:37.087 --> 21:38.588
We took the test the same day.

21:38.656 --> 21:40.423
She signed my name on hers,
and I signed hers on mine.

21:40.491 --> 21:42.092
Why?
What's so funny?

21:42.159 --> 21:45.195
I just pictured you
in drag.

21:45.262 --> 21:46.896
I could pull that off.

21:46.964 --> 21:50.400
I've got soft features.

21:50.468 --> 21:52.135
I want to apologize
for Samuel's behavior.

21:52.203 --> 21:54.504
He's had a chip on his shoulder

21:54.571 --> 21:55.738
ever since
the Department of Justice

21:55.806 --> 21:57.240
investigated Miss Stone's
malfeasance.

21:57.307 --> 22:00.176
He's very protective
of the firm.

22:00.244 --> 22:01.944
That's a good man
to have in your corner.

22:02.012 --> 22:04.147
Well, so are you.

22:04.215 --> 22:05.949
In these folders,
you'll find

22:06.016 --> 22:08.918
every trade made by Morello
Assets in the last year.

22:08.986 --> 22:10.787
Personally delivered by
Burt Kimball, I'm flattered.

22:10.854 --> 22:12.722
Well, we just want
to make sure

22:12.789 --> 22:14.857
you've got everything you need,
Harvey.

22:14.925 --> 22:16.158
We really appreciate
your diligence.

22:16.226 --> 22:18.193
Now I better get back
to the office.

22:18.261 --> 22:21.196
The Australian markets
are just opening up.

22:21.264 --> 22:23.665
Good to see you.
Always a pleasure, Burt.

22:26.136 --> 22:27.703
Harvey, this is great.

22:27.771 --> 22:30.239
We can take
these tip sheets and put them--

22:30.306 --> 22:31.306
what are you doing?

22:31.374 --> 22:32.641
This guy's not that friendly

22:32.709 --> 22:33.876
to his own mother.

22:33.943 --> 22:36.545
He's hiding something,
and I'm pissed.

22:36.613 --> 22:37.946
What are you talking about?

22:38.014 --> 22:39.682
Those aren't the real trades.

22:39.749 --> 22:43.252
Okay.
So how do we get them?

22:43.320 --> 22:47.757
Right.
How do I get them?

22:47.825 --> 22:49.058
Hmm.

22:58.134 --> 22:58.838
Hello?

22:58.839 --> 22:59.446
You figure out how to get

22:59.447 --> 23:00.547
the most profitable trades yet,
Mike?

23:00.615 --> 23:01.782
The Morello brokers hang out
at a bar

23:01.849 --> 23:02.883
called the Closing Bell.

23:02.951 --> 23:04.242
I'm on my way now.
Good.

23:04.243 --> 23:05.210
Just remember you're working.
I'll talk to you later.

You still owe me 20 bucks.

Hey, I need a shot.
What is this?

24:41.669 --> 24:43.637
No, drink mine,
please.

24:43.705 --> 24:45.239
Mm.
Jaeger?

24:45.306 --> 24:46.373
You're better than that, man.

24:52.114 --> 24:56.918
Money!

24:56.986 --> 24:59.421
God, you guys are a bunch
of pussies.

24:59.489 --> 25:02.591
I guarantee you
my biggest trades kick the ass

25:02.658 --> 25:03.592
out of your biggest trades.

25:03.659 --> 25:05.193
I don't think so, brother.

25:05.261 --> 25:10.032
Last month, I made $2 million
on Cahill Metal in one hour.

25:10.100 --> 25:11.266
$2 million?

25:11.334 --> 25:12.768
I made $4 million
off of Montroluxx

25:12.835 --> 25:13.802
back in February.

25:13.870 --> 25:15.337
That stock tripled over night.

25:15.405 --> 25:16.738
What's up?
$4 million?

25:16.806 --> 25:18.172
Oh, that's adorable.

25:18.240 --> 25:20.108
How about the $6 million
I just cleared

25:20.175 --> 25:21.542
on Rypien Micro Devices.

25:21.610 --> 25:23.711
Oh, yeah?
What do you think my boy here

25:23.779 --> 25:25.246
made on Piper Web Systems?
What, this guy?

25:25.314 --> 25:26.781
- Right here.
- Uh-huh.

25:26.849 --> 25:28.216
Uh, I don't know.
A pack of chewing gum

25:28.284 --> 25:30.652

25:33.756 --> 25:35.290
Oh, it's on.

25:35.358 --> 25:37.959
Ohh!

25:38.027 --> 25:39.994
Vince Landis!
$7 million off

25:40.062 --> 25:41.862
of Drogin Limited.

25:41.930 --> 25:44.098
$8 million
off of Epling RTX.

25:44.166 --> 25:48.202
$9 million off
of RMA Integrated Products.

25:48.270 --> 25:50.538
Well, gentlemen,
greed is good.

25:50.605 --> 25:52.706
So is his sister.
Right?

25:52.774 --> 25:54.842
Come on, man.
That's his sister.

25:54.909 --> 25:56.443
That's not cool.

Dude, you just made,
like, the same joke.

Hey, Bradley's finally here.

26:06.655 --> 26:09.089
Uh, all right, ladies.
Listen, I got to split.

26:09.157 --> 26:10.591

Good.
We'll talk tomorrow.

26:40.057 --> 26:41.224
What? No.
I'm coming over now.

26:41.292 --> 26:42.559
You're drunk.
Do not come over.

26:42.626 --> 26:46.763
All right. Cool.
I'll see you in a minute.

26:46.831 --> 26:48.932
Hey.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.467
Harvey, come on.

26:50.535 --> 26:51.869
We got to save Gabby.

26:51.937 --> 26:53.904

26:53.972 --> 26:57.275
Oh.
Oh, you got a sweet place, dude.

26:57.343 --> 26:59.344
Don't ever call me dude.

26:59.412 --> 27:01.246
Do you think that maybe
I could take it off your hands,

27:01.314 --> 27:03.816
like, when you go
out of town?

27:03.883 --> 27:05.350
Like a house-sitting-type
situation?

27:05.418 --> 27:07.552
Remind me to have Donna
get you a spare key.

27:07.620 --> 27:09.054
You have the trades?

27:09.121 --> 27:10.321
Tada.

27:10.389 --> 27:12.023
Good.

27:12.091 --> 27:13.691
Hey, when can we...

27:13.759 --> 27:15.226
I'm still upset that
I didn't get the internship.

27:15.293 --> 27:16.594
It would have been so much fun
to work together,

27:16.661 --> 27:19.763
don't you think?
Oh, absolutely.

27:19.831 --> 27:21.665
Let me ask you something.

27:21.732 --> 27:25.068
How did you turn it around
with the LSATs?

27:25.136 --> 27:26.170
What do you mean?

27:26.237 --> 27:28.072
Well, come on.

27:28.140 --> 27:29.574
You took 'em,
didn't do so well,

27:29.642 --> 27:30.808
and now you're at Harvard Law.

27:30.876 --> 27:33.378
It's exactly what I want
to be doing.

27:33.446 --> 27:34.579
So you can tell me.

27:34.647 --> 27:36.348
What'd you do,
sleep with the grader?

27:37.851 --> 27:39.651
What?

27:43.056 --> 27:46.291
I paid someone
to take them for me.

27:49.862 --> 27:52.030
What?

27:52.098 --> 27:53.031
There's this guy.

27:53.099 --> 27:54.500
I heard about him

27:54.568 --> 27:57.069
from a friend of a friend's.

27:57.137 --> 27:58.504
Paid him 1,000 bucks

27:58.572 --> 28:00.839
and he took the LSATs for me.

28:00.907 --> 28:02.274
He got me a 172.

28:02.341 --> 28:04.643
You cheated on the LSATs?

28:04.711 --> 28:06.612
When we were paralegals,
we were smarter

28:06.680 --> 28:07.846
than half the associates.

28:07.914 --> 28:10.116
Why should I be denied
my chance

28:10.183 --> 28:11.884
because I can't pass
some stupid test?

28:11.952 --> 28:14.654
I'm living my dream,
Rache.

28:14.722 --> 28:16.557
I'm not gonna apologize for it
to anyone.

28:20.496 --> 28:23.098
Come on.
Come on.

28:28.404 --> 28:29.805
Hello?

28:29.873 --> 28:31.506
Mikey, yo,
it's Scott.

28:31.574 --> 28:33.642
Scott?
How are you, man?

28:33.710 --> 28:35.644
I haven't talked to you
in forever.

28:35.712 --> 28:38.180
Are you still taking LSATs
for other people?

28:38.248 --> 28:40.549
I got a customer
for you.

28:40.617 --> 28:41.951
No, man.

28:42.019 --> 28:43.520
I'm not in that business
anymore.

28:43.587 --> 28:45.021
I'm sorry.
Trust me.

28:45.089 --> 28:47.057
You want to take
this meeting, dude.

28:47.125 --> 28:50.227
This chick is smoking hot.

28:50.295 --> 28:51.795
What's her name?

28:51.863 --> 28:54.632
Rachel Zane.

28:54.699 --> 28:56.166
You didn't give her my name,
did you?

28:56.234 --> 28:58.135
No.
Of course not.

28:58.203 --> 28:59.771
I'm not taking
that meeting, man.

29:29.191 --> 29:31.059
What do you want me
to sign now?

29:31.060 --> 29:32.360
A confession
that I killed Kennedy?

29:32.428 --> 29:33.562
I'm not gonna pretend

29:33.630 --> 29:34.576
to be your best friend,
Miss Stone.

29:34.577 --> 29:36.443
But my interests happen to be
aligned with yours right now,

29:36.444 --> 29:38.345
so please sit down.

29:42.851 --> 29:44.652
Your colleagues'
most profitable trades.

29:44.720 --> 29:46.821
Why are you showing them
to me?

29:46.889 --> 29:49.023
Every single one of them
comes from stocks

29:49.091 --> 29:51.326
that Morello Assets
didn't officially recommend.

29:51.394 --> 29:53.728
This is either a hell
of a coincidence,

29:53.796 --> 29:56.198
or these traders were all given
different tip sheets.

29:56.265 --> 29:57.766
So you believe me
when I said

29:57.834 --> 29:59.734
my tip sheet had
Lunardi Pharmaceuticals on it.

29:59.802 --> 30:01.336
Well, I'm getting there,

30:01.403 --> 30:03.404
but you got flagged
by the D.O.J.

30:03.472 --> 30:04.806
And no one else at Morello did,

30:04.873 --> 30:06.006
so I want to know why.

30:06.074 --> 30:09.409
What's different here?

30:09.477 --> 30:11.611
None of these trades
are for more than $9 million.

30:11.679 --> 30:13.413
That's Morello's
recommended amount.

30:13.481 --> 30:16.149
And your Lunardi purchase
was for $10 million.

30:16.217 --> 30:19.353
Maybe someone figured out
that any trade under $10 million

30:19.421 --> 30:20.688
wouldn't draw D.O.J. attention.

30:20.756 --> 30:23.258
Why'd you make a trade
for $1 million more

30:23.325 --> 30:24.826
than the recommended amount?

30:24.894 --> 30:26.995
Look at me.

30:27.063 --> 30:30.032
I'm not exactly
fraternity material.

30:30.100 --> 30:31.734
It's a cutthroat world,

30:31.802 --> 30:34.070
and I wasn't performing well.

30:34.138 --> 30:37.806
So I took a chance,
and I tried to hit it big.

30:37.874 --> 30:40.042
I picked the wrong trade.

30:40.109 --> 30:43.111
Gabby, if you knew
you were innocent,

30:43.179 --> 30:44.980
then why didn't you fight this
harder?

30:47.851 --> 30:50.185
After I saw how much money
the trade made,

30:50.253 --> 30:52.421
I suspected something.

30:52.488 --> 30:53.922
I went to Burt Kimball,

30:53.990 --> 30:57.058
he reassured me that I made
a profitable trade

30:57.126 --> 30:58.326
and did nothing wrong.

30:58.394 --> 31:01.764
He even told me
I had a $300,000 bonus

31:01.831 --> 31:05.067
coming at the end
of the quarter.

31:05.135 --> 31:06.302
I should have gone to someone,

31:06.370 --> 31:10.306
said something.

31:10.374 --> 31:13.443
I made one mistake,

31:13.511 --> 31:15.945
and I'm gonna regret it
for the rest of my life.

31:18.682 --> 31:23.119
Scott.
Yeah, it's Mike Ross.

31:23.187 --> 31:27.391
This Rachel Zane,
tell her I'll take the meeting.

31:27.459 --> 31:29.160
Just don't tell her my name.

31:29.228 --> 31:30.962
Who's that on the phone?

31:31.030 --> 31:35.433
It's nothing.

31:45.144 --> 31:46.579
You thinking about Gabby?

31:46.646 --> 31:49.114
I'm thinking
about her lawyer.

31:49.182 --> 31:50.949
- What?
- Knowing what she said,

31:51.017 --> 31:52.717
why would that Zegan guy
agree to a deal

31:52.785 --> 31:55.119
that puts his client behind bars
without even putting up a fight?

31:55.187 --> 31:56.721
I can't stand
that kind of shoddy work.

31:56.789 --> 31:58.556
It's like the bad version
of both of us.

31:58.624 --> 32:00.625
He doesn't care about his client
and he's not about winning.

32:00.693 --> 32:02.493
He's got even less style
than you.

32:02.561 --> 32:03.961
I don't really see
how that's relevant.

32:04.029 --> 32:04.862
Like at all.
Hold on.

32:04.930 --> 32:06.030
How did she get this lawyer?

32:06.098 --> 32:07.531
Her friend Bradley.

32:07.598 --> 32:08.899
The one who also works
at Morello?

32:08.966 --> 32:10.500
Yeah.

32:10.568 --> 32:12.268
I don't think Bradley's
as good a friend

32:12.336 --> 32:13.436
as she thinks he is.

32:13.504 --> 32:15.871
Here's what you're gonna do.

32:18.242 --> 32:20.843
I looked into it.
You were right.

32:20.911 --> 32:22.378
Put this together fast.

32:22.446 --> 32:24.380
I care about Gabby.

32:24.448 --> 32:27.283
You were right too.

32:29.353 --> 32:30.920
You want me to go with you?

32:33.124 --> 32:34.958
I'm sorry, but I got
to take care of this one myself.

32:44.336 --> 32:45.569
Hot dogs,
hamburgers.

32:45.637 --> 32:47.372
- Thank you.
- Hot dogs, hamburgers.

32:47.439 --> 32:50.108
Rachel?

32:50.176 --> 32:52.209
What are you doing
all the way over here?

32:52.277 --> 32:55.012
This guy has
the best soft pretzels in town.

32:55.080 --> 32:56.047
Do you want to try it?

32:56.114 --> 32:57.315
No, I'm good.

32:57.382 --> 32:59.216
Hey, how are you feeling
about the LSATs?

32:59.284 --> 33:01.118
I was really happy with all
the prep we did yesterday.

33:01.186 --> 33:02.286
I'm really excited for you.

33:02.354 --> 33:03.587
You're excited for me?

33:03.655 --> 33:05.622
Why do you even care?
Hot dogs, hamburgers.

33:05.690 --> 33:07.090
- I was just asking.
- Well, just stop asking.

33:07.158 --> 33:09.159
Look, I came down here

33:09.226 --> 33:10.493
because I just want
to be by myself

33:10.561 --> 33:11.894
and I bump into you,
and the first thing

33:11.962 --> 33:13.730
you want to talk about
is the LSATs.

33:13.797 --> 33:16.366
Hey, sorry.

33:16.434 --> 33:19.403
The truth is, I came down here
to clear my head too.

33:19.470 --> 33:20.771
About what?

33:20.839 --> 33:22.073
Gabby Stone.

33:22.140 --> 33:23.474
The girl who did
the insider trading?

33:23.542 --> 33:25.376
She actually suspected
that something was wrong

33:25.444 --> 33:27.579
after the trade, but she didn't
do anything about it.

33:27.646 --> 33:29.347
She didn't want
to jeopardize her career.

33:29.415 --> 33:31.216
Now she's gonna be paying

33:31.284 --> 33:34.018
for that mistake
for the rest of her life.

33:34.086 --> 33:36.454
Anyway, I'm sorry
I ruined your alone time.

33:36.521 --> 33:39.023
I'll see you back at the office.

33:44.295 --> 33:46.029
Let me ask you something,
Nick.

33:46.097 --> 33:48.331
Does Burt Kimball drag his feet
paying you too?

33:48.399 --> 33:49.699
Excuse me?

33:49.767 --> 33:51.234
'Cause in my experience,
getting money

33:51.302 --> 33:53.503
from that asshole is like
getting blood from a stone.

33:53.571 --> 33:54.871
I don't know
what you're talking about.

33:54.939 --> 33:56.072
Yes, you do.

33:56.140 --> 33:57.674
See, after I saw your client

33:57.742 --> 34:00.311
sitting in jail,
I got to wondering.

34:00.379 --> 34:02.180
How'd she find you?

34:02.247 --> 34:03.981
- I'm gonna call security.
- Absolutely.

34:04.049 --> 34:06.017
See, it turns out
that her friend Bradley

34:06.085 --> 34:07.319
recommended you.

34:07.387 --> 34:08.887
Bradley, who's been
at Morello Assets

34:08.955 --> 34:10.188
for the past seven years.

34:10.257 --> 34:12.091
So I checked.

34:12.159 --> 34:14.559
You know what I found?

34:14.627 --> 34:15.960
You represented Burt Kimball

34:16.027 --> 34:17.829
in a civil suit
12 years ago.

34:17.897 --> 34:20.097
It just so happens
you also represented

34:20.165 --> 34:25.469
Lunardi Pharmaceuticals in
their FDA approval proceedings.

34:25.536 --> 34:26.902
That doesn't mean anything.

34:26.971 --> 34:28.838
You've seen my relationship
with the D.O.J.

34:28.906 --> 34:30.072
Want me to point them
in your direction?

34:30.139 --> 34:31.974
Or do you want to admit to me

34:32.042 --> 34:34.810
that Burt Kimball's
paying you off?

34:49.743 --> 34:51.268
Harvey,

34:51.270 --> 34:53.170
I don't understand.

34:53.239 --> 34:55.507
I thought all this business
was done with.

34:55.574 --> 34:56.809
It's almost sorted out,
Dean.

34:56.876 --> 34:58.043
I'm just here
to let you know

34:58.111 --> 34:59.344
that Burt's a crook.

34:59.412 --> 35:00.812
What did you say?

35:00.880 --> 35:01.813
Harvey.

35:01.881 --> 35:02.914
He used a lawyer

35:02.982 --> 35:04.115
to periodically provide him

35:04.182 --> 35:05.149
with insider information.

35:05.217 --> 35:07.585
Once he got this information,

35:07.652 --> 35:10.687
he handed out one tip sheet
different from all the others,

35:10.755 --> 35:13.089
so the trader, in this instance,
Gabrielle Stone,

35:13.157 --> 35:14.791
would make a trade
not knowing

35:14.858 --> 35:16.492
that she was acting
on an illegal tip.

35:16.560 --> 35:18.661
It was actually ingenious.

35:18.729 --> 35:20.664
If the trade
was ever under suspicion,

35:20.731 --> 35:22.266
even the trader couldn't point
to Burt.

35:22.333 --> 35:24.335
We've heard more than enough,
thank you.

35:24.402 --> 35:25.536
I don't think so.

35:25.604 --> 35:27.372
Miss Stone made two mistakes.

35:27.439 --> 35:30.008
One, she made a trade
for more than $9 million.

35:30.076 --> 35:32.411
And the other was not going
to the D.O.J.

35:32.479 --> 35:33.779
the second the stock shot up
through the roof.

35:33.847 --> 35:35.715
You son of a bitch.

35:35.783 --> 35:37.784
Harvey, this is a lot
to digest.

35:37.852 --> 35:39.920
Well, I'll make it easy
for you, Dean.

35:39.988 --> 35:41.721
He's a cancer.

35:41.789 --> 35:43.857
You don't cut him loose, he's
gonna kill your whole company.

35:43.924 --> 35:45.558
How dare you
walk in here

35:45.626 --> 35:47.360
and accuse me with these things?

35:47.428 --> 35:49.530
I mean, you are my lawyer.

35:49.597 --> 35:52.732
No, Burt, I'm the lawyer
for Morello Asset Management.

35:52.800 --> 35:54.701
As far as the law
is concerned,

35:54.769 --> 35:55.802
Dean Morello's my client,
not you.

35:55.870 --> 35:57.270
Dumb son of a bitch.

35:57.338 --> 35:59.106
Burt, you're fired.

35:59.173 --> 36:00.207
What?

36:00.274 --> 36:01.708
Effective immediately.

36:01.776 --> 36:03.210
You're gonna fire me?
Because of this?

36:04.846 --> 36:06.613
I hope you're happy.

36:06.681 --> 36:09.383
'Cause without me,
this hedge fund's nothing.

36:09.451 --> 36:10.918
I'll be happy
when the Department of Justice

36:10.986 --> 36:12.553
puts your ass in handcuffs.

36:12.621 --> 36:14.789
Enjoy your freedom, Burt,
because they're coming for you.

36:14.856 --> 36:17.625
And since you're a bigger trophy
than Gabrielle Stone,

36:17.693 --> 36:20.895
you're gonna get a whole lot
more than 11 months.

36:23.431 --> 36:25.632
Harvey,
I want you to know

36:25.700 --> 36:28.868
that I knew nothing
about any of this.

36:28.936 --> 36:32.204
Dean,
when I was 13 years old,

36:32.272 --> 36:34.306
my little brother
was getting bullied by a kid

36:34.374 --> 36:35.608
in the neighborhood.

36:35.675 --> 36:37.676
One day, I confronted
the kid's father.

36:37.744 --> 36:39.478
He told me he didn't know
anything about it.

36:39.546 --> 36:42.648
You know what his problem was?

36:42.715 --> 36:46.285
It was his goddamn job
to know.

36:56.596 --> 36:58.397
Thanks for getting me out.

36:58.465 --> 37:00.733
We're just sorry
we couldn't get you your bonus.

37:00.800 --> 37:02.467
It wasn't mine
to begin with.

37:02.535 --> 37:04.836
But without it, I don't know
how I'm gonna pay you.

37:04.904 --> 37:06.137
Don't worry about it.

37:06.205 --> 37:08.806
Dean Morello's
footing this bill.

37:08.874 --> 37:10.441
You believed in me.

37:12.544 --> 37:15.179
I can't tell you how grateful
I am to both of you.

37:15.246 --> 37:17.414
Never doubted you
for a second.

37:19.351 --> 37:22.553
Oh, Gabby, I wanted
to give you something.

37:22.621 --> 37:25.790
Left it on your desk.

37:27.826 --> 37:30.362
Thank you.

37:30.430 --> 37:32.731
All right, well,
I'm gonna find some water.

37:34.935 --> 37:36.135
You don't come back soon,

37:36.203 --> 37:40.005
we're sending out
a search party.

37:40.073 --> 37:42.341
You never doubted her
for a second?

37:42.409 --> 37:43.308
I didn't doubt her
for a second.

37:43.376 --> 37:44.743
I doubted her for days.

37:44.811 --> 37:46.111
Yeah, that's not what
you just led her to believe.

37:46.179 --> 37:47.879
People hear
what they want to hear.

37:47.947 --> 37:49.247
Oh, I meant to ask you,

37:49.315 --> 37:50.849
that big guy
that you got in a fight with,

37:50.916 --> 37:53.317
Mr. T,
was he in on this whole thing?

37:53.385 --> 37:56.620
No, he was just a dick.

38:01.293 --> 38:04.463
That was
the most brilliant portrayal

38:04.531 --> 38:06.565
of <i>King Lear</i>
I have ever seen.

38:06.633 --> 38:08.867
"Come up between the dragon
and his wrath."

38:08.935 --> 38:10.335
That was...

38:10.403 --> 38:12.472
Thank you for tonight,
Jessica, really.

38:12.539 --> 38:13.640
This was nice.

38:13.707 --> 38:15.808
This is really,
really nice.

38:15.876 --> 38:17.443
You're welcome, Louis.

38:17.511 --> 38:19.712
And, yes, this was--
this was really nice.

38:19.780 --> 38:24.117
Listen, I just want you to know
how much I appreciate

38:24.185 --> 38:26.186
everything that you do
for this firm.

38:26.254 --> 38:27.954
I take a lot of pride
in my work.

38:28.022 --> 38:29.890
I know, and you're very good
at what you do.

38:29.957 --> 38:33.560
Okay, can you just please say
that once in front

38:33.628 --> 38:35.195
of Harvey?

38:35.263 --> 38:36.763
Louis, I know
you and Harvey

38:36.831 --> 38:41.167
have a rivalry.

38:41.235 --> 38:43.637
And the truth
is that, right now,

38:43.705 --> 38:46.173
Harvey is more valuable
to the firm.

38:46.240 --> 38:50.576
But that doesn't always mean

38:50.644 --> 38:52.211
that he is going
to be on top.

38:52.279 --> 38:55.714
Because another truth is
is that I can't always count

38:55.782 --> 38:58.150
on Harvey to listen to me,

38:58.218 --> 38:59.318
but I can count on you.

38:59.386 --> 39:01.654
Yeah.
Yes, you can.

39:01.722 --> 39:04.291
So you keep doing
what you're doing, Louis,

39:04.359 --> 39:05.726
and you're gonna be just fine.

39:05.793 --> 39:07.261
And if he doesn't know it
already,

39:07.328 --> 39:10.698
I promise
Harvey is going to understand

39:10.766 --> 39:12.700
just how valuable
you are to me.

39:15.938 --> 39:17.072
You know, next week
there's a revival of <i>Cats.</i>

39:17.140 --> 39:18.574
No.

39:26.116 --> 39:27.816
Nice touch.
Tickets to the Yankee game.

39:27.884 --> 39:29.051
Found 'em on my desk.

39:29.119 --> 39:30.386
Can't wait.
You're welcome.

39:30.453 --> 39:31.987
Nachos are on you this time.

39:32.055 --> 39:33.856
Oh, those tickets
aren't for you and me.

39:33.924 --> 39:36.759
They're for you and Louis.

39:36.826 --> 39:38.060
Sunday the 20th.

39:38.128 --> 39:39.361
Did I mention
that I'm busy that night?

39:39.429 --> 39:40.629
I know you are.

39:40.697 --> 39:42.431
You're busy going
to the Yankee game

39:42.499 --> 39:43.432
with Louis.

39:43.500 --> 39:45.967
Son, your ego's writing checks

39:46.035 --> 39:48.070
that your body can't cash.

39:48.137 --> 39:50.638
Oh, see, that's funny,
because now I'm quoting

39:50.706 --> 39:52.139
<i>Top gun</i> and--
get out of my office.

39:52.207 --> 39:56.577
Very funny.
Very funny.

39:56.645 --> 39:58.278
Very funny.

40:00.448 --> 40:02.049
Mike.

40:02.117 --> 40:04.018
Hey, you got a second?

40:04.085 --> 40:06.220
I just--
I just want to thank you.

40:06.288 --> 40:07.422
Thank me for what?

40:07.490 --> 40:08.823
For going out of your way

40:08.891 --> 40:10.225
to help me with the LSATs.

40:10.292 --> 40:11.593
It's nothing.

40:11.660 --> 40:12.794
I'm sure you'd do
the same for me.

40:12.861 --> 40:14.729
I put a lot of pressure
on myself.

40:14.797 --> 40:16.197
I always have.

40:16.265 --> 40:17.265
You're right.

40:17.333 --> 40:18.600
I'm a perfectionist.

40:18.668 --> 40:20.302
It's okay.

40:20.370 --> 40:21.803
No, it's not okay.

40:21.871 --> 40:25.141
My dad,
he always wanted a son.

40:25.208 --> 40:26.509
Never something
that they brought up.

40:26.577 --> 40:28.611
It was just sort of there.

40:28.679 --> 40:31.915
And I never felt
like I was good enough for him.

40:31.983 --> 40:33.684
Which is why I don't like
to put myself in positions

40:33.752 --> 40:35.786
where I might fail.

40:35.854 --> 40:39.223
So I decided
to just push the LSATs,

40:39.290 --> 40:40.858
give myself
a little more time to study.

40:40.926 --> 40:43.426
That's good.
That's great.

40:43.494 --> 40:45.428
I think you made
the right choice.

40:45.496 --> 40:48.064
Really?
Why?

40:48.131 --> 40:49.465
You were the one that's been
pushing me to take them

40:49.532 --> 40:50.532
next week.

40:50.600 --> 40:51.633
I just meant that I,
you know,

40:51.701 --> 40:53.935
support the decision
you made.

40:54.003 --> 40:56.571
Why are you suddenly changing
your tune?

40:56.639 --> 40:59.374
Because if you're not ready,
you're not ready.

40:59.442 --> 41:01.744
Listen, I got to go.
I'll see you tomorrow.

41:01.811 --> 41:03.045
No, that's not why.

41:03.113 --> 41:04.814
All that interest
in Theresa

41:04.882 --> 41:06.750
and then the other guy
didn't show up, but you did.

41:06.817 --> 41:08.585
You were gonna take
the test for me.

41:08.653 --> 41:10.053
What guy?
What are you talking about?

41:10.121 --> 41:11.054
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

41:11.122 --> 41:13.023
You're the test genius,
right?

41:13.091 --> 41:14.925
- Um...
- Mike, I could pick up

41:14.993 --> 41:16.227
the phone
and find out right now.

41:23.034 --> 41:25.001
Yes, I took the test
for your friend Theresa.

41:25.069 --> 41:27.003
That's the whole reason
you were trying to help me.

41:27.071 --> 41:28.337
Because you thought
if you didn't,

41:28.405 --> 41:29.805
you were gonna get caught.
That's not true.

41:29.873 --> 41:31.607
How am I supposed
to believe that?

41:31.675 --> 41:33.408
Honestly, how am I supposed
to believe anything you say

41:33.476 --> 41:34.576
when the whole time
you were at Harvard

41:34.644 --> 41:35.944
studying to be a lawyer,

41:36.012 --> 41:37.879
you were actually cheating
for other people?

41:37.947 --> 41:39.247
Yes, I was helping people
cheat, okay, but--

41:39.315 --> 41:41.049
But what?

41:49.093 --> 41:51.928
It's not the whole story.
