he just lifted
his leg on me, so yeah.

10:35.133 --> 10:38.000
- Peyton and I dated last year.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.667
Unfortunately,
it didn't work out.

10:39.667 --> 10:42.767
I think I have stronger feelings
for someone else.

10:44.633 --> 10:46.767
- But I have never
not been friends

10:46.767 --> 10:49.533
with anybody I've ever dated
after the fact.

10:49.533 --> 10:51.100
Can we just get
a pepperoni pizza?

10:51.100 --> 10:54.000
- Yeah, sure.
- And then the Yella Pils.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.667
Do you want something?

10:55.667 --> 10:57.233
- Extra dirty martini.
- Yeah. Sure.

10:57.233 --> 10:59.400
- With three olives.
That'd be great.

10:59.400 --> 11:01.400
- As long as you didn't
attack and mortally wound

11:01.400 --> 11:04.166
a family member or friend,
we are going to be fine.

11:04.166 --> 11:06.500
It doesn't have to--it doesn't--
- Awesome, thank you.

11:06.500 --> 11:07.700
- Oh, my gosh, that's so dirty.

11:07.700 --> 11:10.000
- Yeah.
- I like it that way.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.166
- I won in trivia last night.

11:11.166 --> 11:14.433
- Cheers.
- Cheers to you, to us.

11:16.433 --> 11:17.633
- At Home Team at--
on Sullivan's.

11:17.633 --> 11:19.166
- Oh, Home Team.

11:19.166 --> 11:20.567
- That's, like,
my home away from home.

11:20.567 --> 11:22.500
- Mm-hmm.
Have you chilled out on partying

11:22.500 --> 11:24.700
since you've moved,
do you think?

11:24.700 --> 11:27.233
- I--uh, yeah.
I have.

11:27.233 --> 11:29.700
Uh, of course, when, like,

11:29.700 --> 11:32.633
you spend a few days laying low,
you're like, "I'm ready."

11:32.633 --> 11:34.166
- Oh, no, yeah, that's natural.

11:34.166 --> 11:35.266
- I got the Plain Jane
right here.

11:35.266 --> 11:37.033
- Pizza.
- Thank you.

Me too.

11:43.567 --> 11:45.266

11:45.266 --> 11:47.033

11:47.033 --> 11:49.200
a bunch of girls that I know
or something like that?

11:49.200 --> 11:51.667

11:51.667 --> 11:53.200

12:05.734 --> 12:08.667

This is all new to me.

14:05.567 --> 14:07.700
- I mean, I've never met
any of Thomas' girlfriends,

14:07.700 --> 14:10.033
so this is, like, new territory.

14:10.033 --> 14:12.166
But we didn't get a chance
to really speak the other night,

14:12.166 --> 14:13.700
so I just figured
it'd be better for us

14:13.700 --> 14:15.300
to get to know each other.

14:15.300 --> 14:18.700
- I appreciate that
'cause I was kind of expecting,

14:18.700 --> 14:22.633
you know, you to be somewhat...

14:22.633 --> 14:25.300
- I don't know what impression
Thomas has made

14:25.300 --> 14:29.133
about my ability
or lack of ability to, like,

14:29.133 --> 14:32.400
be cooperative or work together,
but that's all that I want.

14:32.400 --> 14:34.400
- He wants that.

14:34.400 --> 14:36.200
- But see, the first step...
- He does.

14:36.200 --> 14:39.200
- To doing that
would have been if he

14:39.200 --> 14:42.200
at least told me
he had a serious girlfriend.

14:42.200 --> 14:45.033
He literally has said zip.

14:45.033 --> 14:46.600
I don't even know how long
you guys have been together.

14:46.600 --> 14:48.333
I don't know
when you met my kids,

14:48.333 --> 14:50.333
so there's a lot
of questions I have.

14:50.333 --> 14:53.734
- You know, I came from parents
of divorce when I was young.

14:53.734 --> 14:56.734
I know what it's like
to have a dad with someone new,

14:56.734 --> 14:58.266
mom with someone new.

14:58.266 --> 14:59.433
I mean, it's tough, Kathryn.

14:59.433 --> 15:01.033
It's tough because

15:01.033 --> 15:03.166
I'm very close with
my mom and my sister.

15:03.166 --> 15:06.033
When I decided to
pick up and move here,

15:06.033 --> 15:07.734
everyone was really shocked.

15:07.734 --> 15:12.667
And we all know you can
Google his name,

15:12.667 --> 15:15.100
Thomas's name, and
not the best things come up.

15:15.100 --> 15:17.100
They were concerned.

15:17.100 --> 15:19.467
And they didn't think I was
making the best decision and--

15:19.467 --> 15:21.100
- Yeah.

15:21.100 --> 15:22.367
We met beginning of May,

15:22.367 --> 15:25.100
and then the next weekend
he flew me out here.

15:25.100 --> 15:28.767
- Mm-hmm.
- And I got to know a lot of,

15:28.767 --> 15:30.233
you know, his friends,
and I think that was

15:30.233 --> 15:31.700
actually--that might
have been the first time

15:31.700 --> 15:35.100
I had an interaction
with your children.

15:35.100 --> 15:36.633
- Oh, wow.

15:36.633 --> 15:38.767
So after a week?
Okay.

15:40.633 --> 15:42.100
All right.

15:42.100 --> 15:43.700
- I think that weekend was--

15:43.700 --> 15:47.100
I remember that weekend was,
like, Mother's Day.

15:47.100 --> 15:50.233
- Per our agreement,
Thomas isn't allowed

15:50.233 --> 15:54.066
to introduce our children
to any romantic prospects.

15:54.066 --> 15:57.100
I follow all of the rules,
and there are plenty.

15:57.100 --> 16:01.233
I slip up even once,
I can't see my kids.

16:01.233 --> 16:06.233
He can do anything he wants,
and he still has full custody.

16:06.233 --> 16:08.767
Does that say anything about the
way things work in Charleston

16:08.767 --> 16:12.000
regarding men with money?

16:12.000 --> 16:16.066
Look, the choices he makes
as a father, as a co-parent,

16:16.066 --> 16:17.333
that's out of my hands.
- Yeah.

16:17.333 --> 16:19.667
- What is in my hands
is what I can do

16:19.667 --> 16:21.400

- Yes.

16:21.400 --> 16:24.734
- Whatever level I can,
and that is meeting you.

16:24.734 --> 16:27.000
You know, if there's a chance
where he, you know,

16:27.000 --> 16:30.333
thinks that he can have
a serious relationship...

16:30.333 --> 16:33.467
- Yeah.
- I mean, I really hope that.

16:33.467 --> 16:38.300
It took me years
and a lot of crazy, crazy fights

16:38.300 --> 16:42.767

got me absolutely nowhere.

16:42.767 --> 16:44.767
For the children's sake, they--

16:44.767 --> 16:46.433
the less, like, people coming in
and out of his life...

16:46.433 --> 16:48.233

- The less transition.

in any manner

21:52.533 --> 21:54.333
With Austen and I,
it was hard for everyone

21:54.333 --> 21:56.266
because it's like losing
a member of the family,

21:56.266 --> 21:57.734
especially with my family.

Like, they take you in,

that my dad's taught me

is to try to remain friends

22:26.033 --> 22:28.567

22:28.567 --> 22:31.400

meant to be married,

22:31.400 --> 22:34.700

28:55.066 --> 28:57.266
- I'll be your waiter tonight.
I'm Shep.

28:57.266 --> 28:59.266
Bonjour!
- Bonjour!

28:59.266 --> 29:01.133
- Yes.

29:01.133 --> 29:02.734
- I'm just going
to the bathroom.

29:02.734 --> 29:05.066
- So the main thing
is that, you know,

29:05.066 --> 29:06.734
Craig has been telling us
all that he's single.

29:06.734 --> 29:08.367
- Yeah.

29:08.367 --> 29:10.100
- I want to reintroduce him
to the wild.

29:10.100 --> 29:12.166
- I mean, I think
it's a fine idea.

29:12.166 --> 29:15.233
I just wonder if
he's got the ----ing nuts

29:15.233 --> 29:16.633
to ----ing make it happen.

29:16.633 --> 29:18.633
- And that's the thing.

29:18.633 --> 29:20.600
I don't want to say that the
best way for Craig to get over

29:20.600 --> 29:22.767
Naomie is to get
under someone else,

29:22.767 --> 29:26.300
but the best way is to
just start introducing him

29:26.300 --> 29:28.066
to as many girls as possible.

29:28.066 --> 29:29.633
- We have a shot of Espolon.
- I don't do shots.

29:29.633 --> 29:32.033
- Okay.
- Hey, Megan. Megan!

29:32.033 --> 29:34.600
- Would you like to take the
shot that Whitney won't take?

29:36.166 --> 29:37.767
- Come, come.
Blonde, brunette, redhead.

29:37.767 --> 29:39.633
What do you like?
What do you want?

29:39.633 --> 29:41.734
All right, gentlemen,
it's good to see you all.

29:41.734 --> 29:43.600
I'm glad we can all have
a night out together.

29:43.600 --> 29:44.767
- Cheers.
- All right.

29:44.767 --> 29:47.033
- Cheers.

29:49.633 --> 29:51.133
- Yes.
Thank you so much.

29:51.133 --> 29:52.367
- No problem.
Y'all enjoy.

29:52.367 --> 29:53.633
- Thank you.
- This is awesome.

29:53.633 --> 29:55.133
Look how beautiful our city is.

29:55.133 --> 29:56.667
- All right, menus.
- Yeah.

29:56.667 --> 29:59.400
I'm really excited
for some cheese.

29:59.400 --> 30:01.200
- Hi.
- Good evening.

30:01.200 --> 30:02.734
- We're doing all right.

30:02.734 --> 30:05.000
- Excellent. I'm Matt.
I'll be your server tonight.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.600
- Hi, Matt.
- Hi, Matt.

30:06.600 --> 30:08.734
Can we get a bottle
of the Massican sauvignon blanc?

30:08.734 --> 30:11.266
- You sure can.

30:11.266 --> 30:12.734
- I have Pacifico.
- Let's do that.

30:12.734 --> 30:15.734
- I'm okay, thank you.

30:15.734 --> 30:18.133
- Of course, just the water.
Be right with y'all.

30:20.600 --> 30:24.200
- Oh, my God, I forgot to tell
you, I saw Austen on Bumble.

30:24.200 --> 30:26.000
- I can't tell you
how many times...

30:26.000 --> 30:27.233
- And I just clicked match
to make him feel awkward.

30:27.233 --> 30:28.767
- I have busted his ass
on Bumble dates.

30:28.767 --> 30:30.633
- I don't know.

30:33.266 --> 30:34.767
- A week and a half ago.

30:37.100 --> 30:38.767
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah.

30:38.767 --> 30:40.700
- You dirty, dirty girl.
- Hey, time out, time out.

30:40.700 --> 30:43.000
- Wait-wait-wait,
y'all are still hooking up?

30:43.000 --> 30:44.433
How many times have y'all
since you broke up?

30:44.433 --> 30:46.033
- Three.
- Who cares.

30:46.033 --> 30:47.300
- I mean, I kind of
just needed--

30:47.300 --> 30:50.100
- I don't know you do that.

30:50.100 --> 30:52.266
- I'm sorry.
- I know, I'm so sorry you--

30:52.266 --> 30:55.633
- No worries.
- Like--

30:55.633 --> 30:57.266
Yes, perfect.
- Oh, my God.

30:57.266 --> 31:00.233
It can't be that much longer.

31:00.233 --> 31:01.433
- Okay.
Um...

31:01.433 --> 31:04.367
Two weeks?

31:04.367 --> 31:08.033
- Six months.

31:08.033 --> 31:10.166
- Shut the--
- Damn.

31:10.166 --> 31:11.700
- Yeah.

31:11.700 --> 31:13.333
Well, listen, because
towards the end

31:13.333 --> 31:15.133
Craig and I were fighting
so much that, like,

31:15.133 --> 31:17.667
I don't want to have sex
with you if I'm mad at you.

31:17.667 --> 31:19.333
- You got that good vibrator.

31:21.734 --> 31:23.467
- I don't even--
I don't even u--

31:23.467 --> 31:25.033
- Oh, sorry, I gotta taste--

31:25.033 --> 31:26.400
Oh, my God.

31:26.400 --> 31:29.266
Mine's even waterproof.
It goes with me everywhere.

31:32.467 --> 31:34.400
- Hi.
- Hello.

31:36.033 --> 31:37.467
- Oh, my God.

31:37.467 --> 31:39.066
- Pretty good.
- I'll--I'll come over.

31:39.066 --> 31:40.133
- Oh, my God.
- I'll come over.

31:42.133 --> 31:44.000
- Oh, well,
I'll talk to your friends.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.200
- Everyone's just gonna snake
all of the girls

31:46.200 --> 31:48.266
that I'm trying
to push onto Craig.

31:48.266 --> 31:50.133
- Here's--here's your approach.

31:50.133 --> 31:52.066
- This is Thomas'
surefire way to meet women.

31:52.066 --> 31:52.600
- Yeah, yeah.
- Go.

31:52.600 --> 31:54.734
- 'Cause they like boldness.

31:54.734 --> 31:56.767
Go right there in front of
everybody, even her boyfriend,

31:56.767 --> 31:59.100
"Excuse me, but I would
like to meet you."

31:59.100 --> 32:00.467
All you want to do is meet her.

32:00.467 --> 32:02.300
The best way to meet
a girl is cut in

32:02.300 --> 32:03.433
on her when she's dancing.

32:03.433 --> 32:06.767
Cut in.
Do a little cut.

32:06.767 --> 32:10.100
- I would never, ever do that.

32:10.100 --> 32:13.433
Thomas is unrelentingly Thomas.
That's just what he does.

32:13.433 --> 32:15.700
I mean, I've never seen him
do anything different.

32:15.700 --> 32:18.367
- Unfortunately, we are
from two different eras,

32:18.367 --> 32:20.166
and sh-- changed.

32:20.166 --> 32:23.066
So now the thing that used
to be gentlemanlike back then,

32:23.066 --> 32:24.767
now some people
would think you're a creep.

32:24.767 --> 32:26.433
- No, no, you got to know
how to work it.

32:26.433 --> 32:30.100
And before you know it,
they will come to you.

32:30.100 --> 32:32.033
- Even though that
Thomas thinks that it's

32:32.033 --> 32:34.233
the year, you know, 1932...

32:34.233 --> 32:36.033
- A good way to get punched too.

32:36.033 --> 32:38.533
- With his style of game,

32:38.533 --> 32:41.000
it's still better than Craig's.

32:41.000 --> 32:44.333
It's not the worst advice.

32:44.333 --> 32:46.066
- When was the last time
you talked to Craiggers?

32:46.066 --> 32:49.000
- At the shower, and
we got in a huge fight.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.467
Even broken up,
we still find a way to fight.

32:51.467 --> 32:54.000
I just see red
when Craig says one thing

32:54.000 --> 32:55.400
'cause I have
zero patience with him.

32:55.400 --> 32:56.734
He could be like,
"The sky's blue,"

32:56.734 --> 32:59.000
and I'd be like,
" you!"

32:59.000 --> 33:02.467
But then he sent me a rant
this long at 2:30 a.m.

33:02.467 --> 33:05.200
- Telling you he still
loves you?

33:05.200 --> 33:07.133
- I mean, like,
he still doesn't understand

33:07.133 --> 33:09.367
why, like, we didn't work

33:09.367 --> 33:12.367
because technically we're,
like, two people that, like,

33:12.367 --> 33:14.533
really do love each other, but--

33:14.533 --> 33:16.500
- You need to talk.
- Yeah.

33:16.500 --> 33:19.233
- Remember when you said you had
a tracker on Craig?

33:20.767 --> 33:22.300
- You steal his phone
when he's asleep,

33:22.300 --> 33:24.767
and you turn
on location indefinitely.

33:24.767 --> 33:27.367
- I love it!
- I'm crazy, y'all.

33:27.367 --> 33:29.266
So I suffer from PEG syndrome.

33:29.266 --> 33:31.166
It's called
Psycho Ex-Girlfriend.

33:31.166 --> 33:33.533
You stalk their
Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook,

33:33.533 --> 33:35.367
any Google search you can find.

33:35.367 --> 33:37.500
You look at all of it.

33:37.500 --> 33:40.166
Right now he's--
he is on the corner

33:40.166 --> 33:43.500
of St. Phillip and Spring
at Warehouse.

33:43.500 --> 33:45.166
- That's a good sh--.

33:45.166 --> 33:46.433
- Do you think they're
sitting around the table

33:46.433 --> 33:49.233
right now
discussing relationships?

33:49.233 --> 33:52.367
- Craig, join us!
Craig, come here. Join us.

33:52.367 --> 33:53.767
- You're gonna make me
do this by myself?

33:53.767 --> 33:55.500
- Yes.

33:55.500 --> 33:57.367
- This is literally the most
hellish night of my life.

33:57.367 --> 33:59.467
- What, why is meeting a bunch
of pretty girls hellish?

34:00.467 --> 34:02.333
- Okay, all right.

34:02.333 --> 34:06.133
- Until I'm sure that
Naomie and I are actually done,

34:06.133 --> 34:09.433
I don't think I'm ready
to sleep with anyone else.

34:10.433 --> 34:12.166
- Yes, he went to
College of Charleston...

34:12.166 --> 34:14.533
- I transferred--
- Undergrad and law school.

34:14.533 --> 34:17.266
And he passed the bar.
He's on the up-and-up.

34:17.266 --> 34:20.333

that throws away,

34:20.333 --> 34:22.533
you know, the last three years
we had together.

34:22.533 --> 34:25.367

Look at him.

with girls, go out with anyone--

37:49.367 --> 37:50.500
- Y'all got to be--yeah.
- I want to know where we're at.

37:50.500 --> 37:52.233
- Yeah.

37:52.233 --> 37:53.367
All right, are you happy
with your hair?

37:53.367 --> 37:55.200
- Yes.

37:55.200 --> 37:56.500
- Now's a good time
to meet with Naomie

37:56.500 --> 37:58.200
'cause you have
a clean neckline.

37:58.200 --> 38:01.500
All right, let's get
this off your neck.

38:01.500 --> 38:02.467
- Thank you.

38:02.467 --> 38:05.367
You think Naomie
will take me back now?

38:05.367 --> 38:07.333
- You better go see her
right now

38:07.333 --> 38:09.333
before you mess up your hair.

38:12.367 --> 38:17.367
♪ ♪

38:18.633 --> 38:19.734
Can I just have a table
for two, please?

38:19.734 --> 38:21.266
- Yeah.
- Perfect.

38:21.266 --> 38:23.266
I'm really tired of being mad

38:23.266 --> 38:25.533
all the time about anything
to do with Craig.

38:25.533 --> 38:27.400
I don't want to feel
that way anymore.

38:27.400 --> 38:28.400
Yeah. Thank you.
- Yeah. Be right back.

38:28.400 --> 38:29.667
- No problem.

38:32.467 --> 38:34.266
- Hey.

38:34.266 --> 38:35.533
What's up?
- Hey.

38:35.533 --> 38:37.367
How are you?

38:37.367 --> 38:38.500
- Good.

38:38.500 --> 38:39.667
- Good to see you.
- You too.

38:39.667 --> 38:42.000
- You smell good.
- Thank you.

38:43.667 --> 38:45.400
- There you go.
- Thank you.

38:45.400 --> 38:47.533
- A Kosh or a Kolsch,
however you say it?

38:47.533 --> 38:48.533
- Kolsch.
- Yeah.

38:48.533 --> 38:50.266
both: Kolsch.

38:50.266 --> 38:51.400
- Um, well, thanks for coming
to meet me.

38:51.400 --> 38:52.700
- Of course.
I don't know.

38:52.700 --> 38:54.700
We're so nice to each other
when we're texting.

38:54.700 --> 38:56.166
And then when we do
see each other,

38:56.166 --> 38:58.300
we can't help but fight.

38:58.300 --> 39:01.700
But if you wanted
to get back together, like,

39:01.700 --> 39:03.567
I would love that.

39:03.567 --> 39:06.367
- Craig, I don't know.

39:06.367 --> 39:08.500
- Because I'm not sure that
the changes that I know

39:08.500 --> 39:12.233
that we both, like,
want to happen can happen.

39:12.233 --> 39:14.000
- Well, I can do a lot more.

39:14.000 --> 39:15.433
I'm getting a life coach
because I am...

39:17.133 --> 39:18.700
- Yeah, because I want
to be more productive.

39:18.700 --> 39:21.533
I want to--I don't want
to stay up as late as I do

39:21.533 --> 39:23.500
and wake up as late as I do.

39:23.500 --> 39:25.567
- If you're really, really,
really

39:25.567 --> 39:27.433
gonna change
your lifestyle and get help,

39:27.433 --> 39:29.700
I mean, that's amazing,
but I can't, like,

39:29.700 --> 39:31.700
get back together with you until
I see you doing it. I can't--

39:31.700 --> 39:33.300
- All right, cool, but then
we're not getting back together.

39:33.300 --> 39:34.433
It's very simple.

39:34.433 --> 39:36.033
- I'm not just gonna base

39:36.033 --> 39:38.200
getting back together
off of your words

39:38.200 --> 39:40.333
'cause I based everything off
your words, and it didn't work.

39:42.333 --> 39:45.333
- I spent three years with you
telling me all this bullsh--,

39:45.333 --> 39:47.467
and it made me
cling onto something

39:47.467 --> 39:49.400
that wasn't even there.
Really

39:49.400 --> 39:52.467
- Yeah, because I remember
passing the bar.

39:52.467 --> 39:54.433
I said I was gonna
graduate law school.

39:54.433 --> 39:57.200
I graduated law school. I said I
was gonna take and pass the bar.

39:57.200 --> 39:59.600
I got in the top 93 percentile
of the entire ----ing country.

39:59.600 --> 40:01.166
I said I was gonna buy
a rental property.

40:01.166 --> 40:02.600
I bought a rental property.

40:02.600 --> 40:06.033
So, those are three big life
accomplishments that I did,

40:06.033 --> 40:07.467
so tell me the things
that I said

40:07.467 --> 40:09.000
I was gonna do that I didn't do.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.467
- You were gonna get up
in the morning

40:10.467 --> 40:12.734
and be a productive
member of society.

40:14.567 --> 40:16.500
Like, something like that,
that's attacking.

40:16.500 --> 40:21.233
- I cannot live my life
the way that you live your life.

40:21.233 --> 40:23.033
- You only focus
on the negative.

40:23.033 --> 40:26.367
- Let me talk. Let me talk.
- Look at that tone. Okay.

40:26.367 --> 40:28.367
- I can't get
a word in with you.

40:28.367 --> 40:30.066
- You want to quit
this relationship.

40:30.066 --> 40:32.367
You want to puss out,
and you don't want to try,

40:32.367 --> 40:33.767
and you're trying
to convince yourself--

40:33.767 --> 40:35.633
- Because you're all talk,
no action.

40:35.633 --> 40:37.367
- That is awful.

40:37.367 --> 40:39.433
- God, you make me so mad
I could cry.

40:39.433 --> 40:40.600
- Because you're trying to

40:40.600 --> 40:41.767
convince yourself
not to be with me.

40:41.767 --> 40:43.633
- No, I'm not trying
to convince myself--

40:43.633 --> 40:45.433
- Okay, then we're not together.
Naomie, then we're done.

40:45.433 --> 40:46.633
- No sh-- we're not together,
Craig. I'm just saying--

40:46.633 --> 40:47.633
- Okay, then why are
we even doing this?

40:47.633 --> 40:49.633
I tried to give you a chance.

40:49.633 --> 40:53.367
- Yes.

40:53.367 --> 40:54.633
You look at me like the devil,

40:54.633 --> 40:56.367
and I haven't done
anything wrong.

40:56.367 --> 40:57.667
- You will never, ever, ever,

40:57.667 --> 40:59.400
ever be accountable
for anything.

40:59.400 --> 41:00.667
- Yes, I do.
- You will always deflect.

41:00.667 --> 41:02.100
You will always
blame other people.

41:02.100 --> 41:03.100
- But you're trying to find
something wr--

41:03.100 --> 41:04.333
- You will always talk over!

41:04.333 --> 41:06.000
It doesn't--it doesn't matter.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.266
There are things wrong,
and I'm not okay with them,

41:08.266 --> 41:09.734
and you cannot see it,

41:09.734 --> 41:12.400
and that's why
we're not together, okay?

41:12.400 --> 41:14.533
- You just tear me down
and tell me what's wrong with me

41:14.533 --> 41:17.100
every day
instead of encouraging me.

41:17.100 --> 41:19.667
And so now that
I see your behavior,

41:19.667 --> 41:22.100
I don't want to be
with you anymore

41:22.100 --> 41:25.000
unless you can work on
your negativity problems.

41:25.000 --> 41:28.400
- After this conversation, I

41:28.400 --> 41:30.667
feel a lot better about
us being not together.

41:30.667 --> 41:32.266
- Well, that's good, Naomie.

41:32.266 --> 41:34.100
I hope that--
I hope you figure stuff out.

41:34.100 --> 41:35.667
- And I'm sorry because
I love you, but

41:35.667 --> 41:37.767
you just don't get it,
and I'm sorry for that.

41:37.767 --> 41:40.000
I'm sorry that I'm so angry.
I will say that.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
- Yeah, me too.
It sucks.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.567
And I don't know
what you're angry about.

41:43.567 --> 41:45.033
I think you're angry
because you can't figure out

41:45.033 --> 41:47.033
a reason we're not together.

41:47.033 --> 41:49.700
- You can't really say
that seriously.

41:49.700 --> 41:51.433
Craig...

41:51.433 --> 41:53.400
- And so there's no point
in me talking, because

41:53.400 --> 41:55.100
we live on different planets.
- Okay.

41:55.100 --> 41:57.667
- All I want to do is spend my
life with you, but you--you--

41:57.667 --> 42:01.433
I mean, you can't
help someone that's--

42:01.433 --> 42:02.667
Oh, okay.

42:02.667 --> 42:05.767
♪ ♪

42:05.767 --> 42:08.367
So I guess that means
we're not getting back together.

42:10.433 --> 42:13.433
- On the next episode
of "Southern Charm"...

42:13.433 --> 42:15.533
But you dropped me
on my head when I was a baby.

42:15.533 --> 42:17.567
- I did not.
- You let me fall off the bed.

42:17.567 --> 42:18.667
- Oh.

42:18.667 --> 42:20.433
- I'd like to explore

42:20.433 --> 42:22.066
the possibility
of making my own beer.

42:22.066 --> 42:23.734
- No.

42:23.734 --> 42:27.467
- I don't want to hear.

42:27.467 --> 42:30.166
- Craig said Peyton was, like,
the first girl that he felt

42:30.166 --> 42:33.000
like there could be
anything at all with.

42:33.000 --> 42:34.467
- I'm trying to breathe
normally right now.

42:34.467 --> 42:35.734
I'm so ----ing pissed.

42:35.734 --> 42:37.333
Let me get her address
and her entire

42:37.333 --> 42:39.600
extended family's address.

42:39.600 --> 42:41.667
- Peyton, you do not
look like yourself.

42:41.667 --> 42:43.667
- That's what I love
about Halloween.

42:43.667 --> 42:45.467
- Where are the kids
gonna be for Halloween?

42:45.467 --> 42:47.000
- I'm taking them
trick-or-treating.

42:47.000 --> 42:50.066
Ashley said
we should invite you?

42:50.066 --> 42:51.600
- You went after Shep.
It didn't work.

42:51.600 --> 42:53.467
Then you tried Austen,
maybe Craig,

42:53.467 --> 42:54.600
just shooting darts
to see what stuck.

42:54.600 --> 42:55.700
- I'm not trying Craig!

42:55.700 --> 42:57.166
You have something against me,

42:57.166 --> 42:58.734
and I feel like
it has to do with Craig.

42:58.734 --> 43:00.667
- It has everything to do
with the fact that

43:00.667 --> 43:02.633
you're a ----ing thirsty bitch.
