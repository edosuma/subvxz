00:02.202 --> 00:03.102
- Previously
on <i>awkward...</i>

00:03.104 --> 00:04.336
- I'm not good enough
for matty,

00:04.338 --> 00:05.938
And everyone
knows it.

00:05.939 --> 00:06.505
Collin?

00:06.507 --> 00:09.174
Was it really possible that,
in an alternate universe,

00:09.176 --> 00:11.877
Jenna hamilton was cooler
than matty mckibben?

00:11.879 --> 00:14.179
- You seem a little
out of his league.

00:14.181 --> 00:16.114
- What do you see
in me?

00:18.218 --> 00:19.752
- It was a magical day,
a day of record.

00:19.754 --> 00:22.321
Matty and I had hit
the six-month mark of coupledom,

00:22.323 --> 00:25.624
And as such, I was reflecting
on how far we'd come,

00:25.626 --> 00:28.260
'cause there was an evolution
to relationships,

00:28.262 --> 00:28.961
And by all accounts,

00:28.963 --> 00:31.030
We were each other's
missing link.

00:31.032 --> 00:32.264
For the first time
in a long time,

00:32.266 --> 00:35.167
I had a sense of peace
about the state of our union.

00:35.169 --> 00:36.668
- [panting]

00:36.670 --> 00:38.937
- Even our honeymoon chapter
had closed.

00:38.939 --> 00:39.571
Gone were the days

00:39.573 --> 00:41.306
Of copious public displays
of affection...

00:41.308 --> 00:42.808
- Go get 'em,
sugar booger.

00:42.810 --> 00:44.309
- I will,
my tiny tiger.

00:44.311 --> 00:45.844
- And uncensored
baby talk.

00:45.846 --> 00:47.679
I definitely didn't
miss those days.

00:47.681 --> 00:49.648
'cause matty and I
were fully evolved,

00:49.650 --> 00:53.252
So much so that we had even
bypassed the era of being--

00:53.254 --> 00:54.686
- Jealous?
- Of what?

00:54.688 --> 00:56.989
- The mckibbenites.

00:56.991 --> 00:57.689
- Those are the girls

00:57.691 --> 00:59.792
That were dancing with matty
at homecoming.

00:59.794 --> 01:00.626
They're harmless.

01:00.628 --> 01:01.960
- No, those are
rabid fan girls

01:01.962 --> 01:03.662
Waiting for you to slip
and crack your head.

01:03.664 --> 01:04.863
Just remember,
today's fan club

01:04.864 --> 01:06.231
Is tomorrow's
console patrol.

01:06.233 --> 01:08.000
- They're just
cheering him on.

01:08.002 --> 01:11.103
[girls screaming]

01:11.105 --> 01:12.504
- That's not cheering,
jenna.

01:12.506 --> 01:13.839
It's 50 shades
of cray.

01:13.841 --> 01:14.540
- I'm not worried.

01:14.542 --> 01:17.443
I can share the glory
of my boyfriend.

01:17.445 --> 01:19.211
[girls screaming]

01:19.213 --> 01:19.745
And I could.

01:19.747 --> 01:22.114
Matty and I were beyond
the plateau of pettiness,

01:22.116 --> 01:24.783
And lived on the highest branch
of the trust tree.

01:24.785 --> 01:25.717
We were secure.

01:25.719 --> 01:30.589
We could handle anything
thrown at us.

01:30.591 --> 01:32.558
Or anyone.

01:35.161 --> 01:38.764
- Sorry about that
strange outburst with dana.

01:38.766 --> 01:40.866
- You have nothing
to apologize for.

01:40.868 --> 01:42.901
You didn't maul her.
She mauled you.

01:42.903 --> 01:43.735
It was cute.

01:43.737 --> 01:44.770
- You're not jealous?

01:44.772 --> 01:46.038
- No, I'm validated.

01:46.040 --> 01:48.373
Clearly, I have
good taste.

01:48.375 --> 01:52.344
- Hey, babe.
Looks like I got a fan too.

01:54.914 --> 01:56.281
- Tamara is living
and breathing,

01:56.283 --> 01:57.716
So if you don't move it,
you'll lose it,

01:57.718 --> 01:58.717
'cause I could
cut a bitch.

01:58.719 --> 02:00.719
- Hello, bodyguard.
- Shut it, rosati.

02:00.721 --> 02:02.187
You are one flirt away
from making me

02:02.189 --> 02:04.289
Mark my territory
the old-fashioned way.

02:04.291 --> 02:04.990
- And that would be?

02:04.992 --> 02:06.325
- With pee, like a dog.
I'll do it.

02:06.327 --> 02:07.426
- You're a maniac.

02:07.428 --> 02:09.193
- I gotta take a shower
before the bell rings.

02:09.196 --> 02:10.762
- Or you could have
your fan club lick you clean.

02:10.764 --> 02:13.532
- That's not necessary,
unless you'd like the job.

02:13.534 --> 02:17.302
- [sniffs]
ugh, pass.

02:17.304 --> 02:18.337
- Bye.

02:18.339 --> 02:21.773
Yo.

02:21.775 --> 02:22.674
- How can you be so cool

02:22.676 --> 02:25.010
With your boyfriend
being mobbed and manhandled?

02:25.012 --> 02:27.813
- It's called trust, t.
You should try it.

02:27.815 --> 02:30.249
- Trust.
None of you trust yourselves.

02:30.251 --> 02:32.851
You guys are writing things
that you think I want to read?

02:32.853 --> 02:34.853
Trust me,
I don't want to read any of it.

02:34.855 --> 02:38.490
So what do you want
to write?

02:38.492 --> 02:39.525
No one has any idea?

02:39.527 --> 02:43.028
You guys are smack dab
in the middle of puberty.

02:43.030 --> 02:43.795
Well, some of you.

02:43.797 --> 02:45.364
You guys have
raging hormones,

02:45.366 --> 02:49.668
Which, unfortunately,
I can smell.

02:49.670 --> 02:52.804
This is the pre-ejaculation
of your lives.

02:52.806 --> 02:56.341
You guys are on the precipice
of exploding.

02:56.343 --> 02:58.677
And then,
in ten years,

02:58.679 --> 02:59.978
It'll all go flaccid.

02:59.980 --> 03:02.047
So if you can't
get inspired now,

03:02.049 --> 03:02.981
Then [bleep]
bull[bleep] me.

03:02.983 --> 03:08.854
Hoodwink me into believing
that you have something to say.

03:08.856 --> 03:10.389
Fine.
You guys need an incentive.

03:10.391 --> 03:12.724
Who wants to eradicate
50% of their grade?

03:12.726 --> 03:14.760
- Mr. Hart
was laying a trap.

03:14.762 --> 03:15.761
He was being underhanded,

03:15.763 --> 03:17.829
And I was far too savvy
to take the bait.

03:17.831 --> 03:20.933
- Big surprise.
You're playing it safe.

03:20.935 --> 03:22.000
- No, I'm not.
- It's okay.

03:22.002 --> 03:24.303
There's a lot
of safe, conventional writers

03:24.305 --> 03:26.271
Who find success
writing textbooks.

03:26.273 --> 03:29.541
- I'm not playing it safe.
- Yeah, you are.

03:29.543 --> 03:30.475
- Shut up, sadie.

03:30.477 --> 03:31.210
- Why should she
shut up?

03:31.212 --> 03:33.212
When I look at you,
I see a girl

03:33.214 --> 03:34.479
Who keeps it all inside.

03:34.481 --> 03:36.582
And then I read you,
and you prove me right,

03:36.584 --> 03:38.584
Because there's nothing personal
on the page.

03:38.586 --> 03:40.285
You never take
any chances.

03:40.287 --> 03:40.852
- Bull[bleep].

03:40.854 --> 03:43.088
- Oh, wow, finally,
something unexpected from you.

03:43.090 --> 03:44.022
- Not true.

03:44.024 --> 03:45.691
I've written
plenty of stuff

03:45.693 --> 03:47.893
That's personal
and unexpected.

03:47.895 --> 03:49.194
I've exposed myself--

03:49.196 --> 03:49.861
- Not in this class.

03:49.863 --> 03:51.797
And I bet
you'll never be able

03:51.799 --> 03:53.298
To read something
out loud

03:53.300 --> 03:54.366
That exposes
vulnerability.

03:54.368 --> 03:55.834
- I can read anything
I've written.

03:55.836 --> 03:57.636
- Oh, so you're accepting
my challenge?

03:57.638 --> 03:58.036
- Yeah.

03:58.038 --> 03:59.104
Do you want me
to do it sitting down,

03:59.106 --> 04:00.138
Or up there,
in front of the class?

04:00.140 --> 04:02.207
- Neither.
You're going to read it here.

04:02.209 --> 04:05.410
At bean there, done that,
tonight, 8:00 p.M.

04:05.412 --> 04:06.211
It's open mic night.

04:06.213 --> 04:08.146
Be there,
or 50% of your grade

04:08.148 --> 04:09.314
Is going
to be a zero.

04:09.316 --> 04:10.582
- He is a lunatic,

04:10.584 --> 04:11.149
And sadistic.

04:11.151 --> 04:12.985
He is literally
holding me hostage.

04:12.987 --> 04:14.519
- You said
you volunteered.

04:14.521 --> 04:16.954
- Only after
he manipulated me.

04:16.957 --> 04:17.990
I am telling you,

04:17.992 --> 04:20.358
He is a cunning
and brilliant sociopath.

04:20.361 --> 04:21.560
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

04:21.562 --> 04:24.763
Those are very strong words.

04:24.765 --> 04:25.397
So break it down.

04:25.399 --> 04:26.732
What's the method
to his madness?

04:26.734 --> 04:28.767
Does he employ
corporal punishment?

04:28.769 --> 04:31.036
Waterboarding?
Soda boarding?

04:31.038 --> 04:31.737
If you think about it,

04:31.739 --> 04:32.938
The bubbles would
make it a lot worse.

04:32.940 --> 04:34.339
- He doesn't
beat me physically,

04:34.341 --> 04:36.408
But emotionally,
I am starting to feel scarred.

04:36.410 --> 04:40.245
He basically called me
a [bleep] in class.

04:40.247 --> 04:41.179
- Well...

04:41.181 --> 04:42.281
- "well" what?

04:42.283 --> 04:43.448
- If it walks
like a duck,

04:43.450 --> 04:44.516
And it talks
like a duck,

04:44.518 --> 04:46.118
It's probably
a [bleep].

04:46.120 --> 04:46.918
- I am not
a [bleep].

04:46.920 --> 04:48.287
- Don't get me wrong,
I love you, girl,

04:48.289 --> 04:50.889
But you do err
on the milkier side of toast.

04:50.891 --> 04:51.423
- Not true.

04:51.425 --> 04:53.158
- Then why are you
in here complaining?

04:53.160 --> 04:54.226
- Because he is asking me

04:54.228 --> 04:57.029
To read something personal
at open mic.

04:57.031 --> 04:59.665
Bean there, done that?
- Well, yeah.

04:59.667 --> 05:02.000
- Ah, I love that place.
Oh, but,

05:02.002 --> 05:03.769
Man, is it a tough crowd.
- Really?

05:03.771 --> 05:05.370
- You better bring
something good to read.

05:05.372 --> 05:08.440
I'd suggest
August 26th, 2011.

05:08.442 --> 05:10.075
Or September 17th.

05:10.077 --> 05:12.110
No, August 26th.

05:12.112 --> 05:13.679
- What are you talking about?

05:13.681 --> 05:15.247
- Your blog.

05:15.249 --> 05:15.914
It's a winner.

05:15.916 --> 05:19.451
- And now I have to go read
at this stupid coffee house.

05:19.453 --> 05:20.085
It's gonna suck.

05:20.087 --> 05:21.687
I'm gonna tank.
- You're gonna be great.

05:21.689 --> 05:24.489
And I will be there
to catch you if you fall.

05:24.491 --> 05:26.158
- No, you won't.
You can't come.

05:26.160 --> 05:27.326
I don't want anyone to come.

05:27.328 --> 05:29.628
- What don't you want us
to come to that we're coming to?

05:29.630 --> 05:30.962
- Nothing.
- She's got a performance

05:30.964 --> 05:32.197
Tonight which she's now
shutting me out of.

05:32.199 --> 05:34.666
- That's not true, I am shutting
all of you out of it.

05:34.668 --> 05:35.634
I am nervous and insecure.

05:35.636 --> 05:38.403
And we don't need
to do everything together.

05:38.405 --> 05:42.474
- Are you implying that I need
to do everything together?

05:42.476 --> 05:43.108
- Well, no.

05:43.110 --> 05:46.278
- Because jake and
I have plans tonight.

05:46.280 --> 05:47.679
Right?
- Right.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.881
- Then why did you want
to catch me if I fall?

05:49.883 --> 05:51.016
- I forgot.

05:51.018 --> 05:52.584
- When did you make plans
without me?

05:52.586 --> 05:54.219
We might have plans tonight.
- Do we?

05:54.221 --> 05:55.721
- No, but the option
was available.

05:55.723 --> 05:58.857
- Look, you do you
and I'll do me.

05:58.859 --> 06:00.125
- That's right,
you do you,

06:00.127 --> 06:02.294
Because you won't be doing me
anytime soon

06:02.296 --> 06:04.062
With a 'tude like that.
- Fine.

06:04.064 --> 06:05.397
- Fine.
- Fine.

06:05.399 --> 06:06.098
- Fine.

06:06.100 --> 06:11.136
We're having a, uh,
"brobecue."

06:11.138 --> 06:12.738
- "brobecue," really?

06:12.740 --> 06:15.207
Since when did matty start
rocking my lexicon?

06:15.209 --> 06:17.109
- Since he started posturing
in an attempt

06:17.111 --> 06:19.644
To cover his codependency,
which is cute.

06:19.646 --> 06:22.481
What's not cute
is this freaking assignment.

06:22.483 --> 06:23.749
What the hell
am I gonna read?

06:23.751 --> 06:25.884
- What about that post
after you went to church camp?

06:25.886 --> 06:28.854
It's topical and safe,
definitely use that.

06:28.856 --> 06:30.655
- Safe was exactly
how mr. Hart

06:30.657 --> 06:31.690
Expected me to play it.

06:31.692 --> 06:33.925
No, I'm not gonna be safe.

06:33.927 --> 06:37.529
Gotta go emotionally
bare naked.

06:37.531 --> 06:39.197
Naked.

06:39.199 --> 06:43.034
August 26th, 2011--
oh, this is perfect.

06:43.036 --> 06:43.902
- I can't wait to hear it.

06:43.904 --> 06:46.204
- Then you're gonna
be waiting a long time,

06:46.206 --> 06:47.606
'cause you're not
coming tonight.

06:47.608 --> 06:49.641
- I thought that show of no go
was just for the boys.

06:49.643 --> 06:53.044
What am I gonna do?
- Sorry, t, you're on your own.

06:53.046 --> 06:55.080
- Ugh.

06:59.051 --> 07:01.119
What do you wanna do tonight?

07:01.121 --> 07:03.355
- Are you girls inviting me
to hang out?

07:03.357 --> 07:05.357
- No, just me.
Jenna has plans.

07:05.359 --> 07:06.324
- Oh. What is she doing?

07:06.326 --> 07:08.827
- She's reading something
at an open mic thingy

07:08.829 --> 07:12.063
At that coffee place with
old people from the '90s.

07:12.065 --> 07:14.699
- Um, those people
are not old.

07:14.701 --> 07:16.501
- Are you hungry?
I'm hungry.

07:16.503 --> 07:19.604
You wanna make us pizza?

07:19.606 --> 07:21.406
Or you could order one.

07:21.408 --> 07:22.574
- Maybe we should
just order pizza.

07:22.576 --> 07:24.743
- We're grilling.
That's what men do.

07:24.745 --> 07:27.512
- Men also order pizza too.
- You know what's weird?

07:27.514 --> 07:29.047
- Besides the fact that
you just put steaks

07:29.049 --> 07:31.583
On a grill that's not hot?

07:31.585 --> 07:33.518

17:24.778 --> 17:25.843
Why'd you come tonight?

17:25.845 --> 17:28.112

Hey.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.551
No, nothing's happening.

18:06.553 --> 18:07.852
- But something
was happening,

18:07.854 --> 18:08.753
And I couldn't explain it.

18:08.755 --> 18:11.389
It was coming fast and swift
and out of the blue.

18:11.391 --> 18:13.691
I was feeling a swirling
deep in my gut

18:13.693 --> 18:16.594
That was exposing my rut.

18:16.596 --> 18:18.463
- Angelique says hi.

18:18.465 --> 18:20.998
She's trying
to make me jealous.

18:21.000 --> 18:21.799
- But it was working on me.

18:21.801 --> 18:24.569
Because suddenly,
I was jealous of angelique,

18:24.571 --> 18:28.172
And looking at her boyfriend
as if he was my own.

18:28.174 --> 18:32.376
- Gotta go.
Call you later.

18:32.378 --> 18:34.212
Sorry about that.

18:34.214 --> 18:35.480
She's out with some friends

18:35.482 --> 18:37.281
And a little peeved
I didn't go,

So she's pulling the old,

18:38.318 --> 18:40.284
"let me tell you
what you're missing" bit.

18:40.286 --> 18:41.686
- Is it working,
making you jealous?

18:41.688 --> 18:45.623
- Strangely, no, which
might be a bit of a problem.

18:45.625 --> 18:46.390
- It's not a problem.

18:46.392 --> 18:48.459
Lack of jealousy
just means you're evolved.

18:48.461 --> 18:50.294
There's trust between you.

to share that story.

Although I sort of
wish it wasn't that story,

19:27.200 --> 19:29.600
So your dad
could've stayed.

19:29.602 --> 19:31.936
He would've been
so proud--

19:31.938 --> 19:33.971

from your class there?

19:49.589 --> 19:50.755
- No.

19:50.757 --> 19:52.123
- Then why did he go?

19:52.125 --> 19:54.192
- I don't know.
Because we're friends?

- Friends, really?

19:56.596 --> 19:58.629
Is that all?

They threaten to go extinct.

20:25.692 --> 20:28.526
Because evolution
was about revolution.

20:28.528 --> 20:32.163
And maybe my lack of jealousy
meant something.
