Vanessa: Anyway, that's probably
more detail than you need.

00:07.808 --> 00:11.310
But the point is the teachers'
union has bent over backwards

00:11.312 --> 00:12.644
to try to solve
this thing,

00:12.646 --> 00:15.347
and the school board
has just dug in.

00:15.349 --> 00:16.281
You know
who suffers?

00:16.283 --> 00:18.884
Me.

00:18.886 --> 00:20.052
The students.

00:20.054 --> 00:21.286
The students --
aren't they supposed to be

00:21.288 --> 00:22.788
the most
important thing?

00:22.790 --> 00:24.456
They're the reason
I became a teacher.

00:24.458 --> 00:26.125
But, no, it's like everybody's
forgotten about them.

00:26.127 --> 00:28.127
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

00:28.129 --> 00:30.462
I hear that diaries are still
a thing with your generation.

00:30.464 --> 00:32.464
Do you want a pen?

00:32.466 --> 00:33.899
I think I fixed
the barbecue grill.

00:33.901 --> 00:35.300
Oh, Dad, thank God!

00:35.302 --> 00:38.404
Oh, Mom needs to vent about her
union strike-y thingy,

00:38.406 --> 00:42.007
but I have
to stop listening.

00:42.009 --> 00:43.308
Listen, listen.
Sit down.

00:43.310 --> 00:44.576
No, come --
Sit, sit.

00:44.578 --> 00:46.712
I actually cannot listen
to your mom vent.

00:46.714 --> 00:48.414
No, but you have to
because you married her.

00:48.416 --> 00:50.682
I just walked
into the kitchen.

00:50.684 --> 00:54.887
I literally<i> can't</i> listen
to your mom vent. Vanessa.

00:54.889 --> 00:57.256
Well, over the years,
your father and I have come up

00:57.258 --> 01:00.159
with a healthy way of dealing
with these situations.

01:00.161 --> 01:03.562
Yeah, we don't deal
with these situations.

01:03.564 --> 01:05.664
Okay, how is that
healthy?

01:05.666 --> 01:08.067
Sometimes, I just need
a sympathetic ear

01:08.069 --> 01:09.601
to listen
to how I'm feeling.

01:09.603 --> 01:12.404
And your dad,
bless his heart,

01:12.406 --> 01:13.705
can't help
but try to fix things.

That's me, the annoying
tool man

things better.

of that book

Women Are from Venus."

is Still Broken."

When I want to share
my feelings,

01:30.524 --> 01:32.458
I find somebody else
to talk to.

01:32.460 --> 01:33.792
And I try to get out
of the house quick

01:33.794 --> 01:35.094
so I don't try
to fix something.

01:35.096 --> 01:36.795
Yeah.

01:36.797 --> 01:38.730
It's how a good marriage
evolves.

01:38.732 --> 01:40.632
You should remember this
when you marry Kyle.

01:40.634 --> 01:42.067
Yeah,
totally unnecessary.

Kyle doesn't have any solutions.

Perfect.

See, she already doesn't
want my advice,

01:48.876 --> 01:50.542

Ah.

At least you're not
doing something

02:20.741 --> 02:24.243
that's just bad for you,
but it looks stupid, too.

02:24.245 --> 02:26.478

how to take care of themselves

All right.

03:29.810 --> 03:32.311
Look, look, as a scientist,
I can tell you

that this is not
just harmless water vapor.

There you go. And no matter
what form it's delivered in,

they put in hot dogs.

But they're still safer
than cigarettes.

This could also be a gateway
to cigarette smoking.

04:05.412 --> 04:07.212
Yes,
a horrible addiction.

04:07.214 --> 04:08.847
Yes. You know, when I
was a grad student,

04:08.849 --> 04:11.049
I started having a cigarette
every now and then

04:11.051 --> 04:12.384
just as
a stress reliever.

how it makes us feel...

is yours.

it would help me

07:58.579 --> 08:00.612
if you were to take me
up to the cabin

off that terrible kayak.

help you, huh?

is, uh, you know, a spa day.

Drought? I don't need
no stinkin' water.

20:42.108 --> 20:43.341
Ice age?

20:43.343 --> 20:47.745
Hey, wooly mammoth,
fur coats are for sissies.

20:47.747 --> 20:50.681
So why is the black rhino
extinct?

20:50.683 --> 20:51.749
Because they fell prey

20:51.751 --> 20:53.718
to the most dangerous predator
of all --

20:53.720 --> 20:56.387
horny humans.

20:56.389 --> 20:59.957
Yeah, a, uh, "far eastern"
business man decided

20:59.959 --> 21:04.362
crushed rhino horn could put
some lead in that tiny pencil.

21:04.364 --> 21:08.232
You know, like the ones
you use on a golf scorecard.

21:08.234 --> 21:09.467
That was that.

21:09.469 --> 21:10.868
His horn
became a problem.

21:10.870 --> 21:12.570
The rhino couldn't
get rid of it.

21:12.572 --> 21:13.804
He didn't evolve.

21:13.806 --> 21:16.073
So, buh-bye.

21:16.075 --> 21:17.541
It's just like
a marriage, really.

21:17.543 --> 21:19.877
If you and your spouse have
a problem and you don't evolve,

21:19.879 --> 21:21.545
then your marriage
will be like this Rhino

21:21.547 --> 21:24.081
and exist only
in pricey photographs.

21:24.083 --> 21:28.152
On sale all this week
