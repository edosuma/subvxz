WEBVTT

00:04.571 --> 00:06.373
We're at a party, Lemon.
Try to loosen up a little.

00:06.373 --> 00:07.574
How can I loosen up?

00:07.574 --> 00:08.742
I'm in Connecticut,
I haven't eaten

00:08.742 --> 00:11.578
and I'm stressed about
an "away toilet" situation.

00:11.578 --> 00:13.179
Do you know how lucky we are?

00:13.179 --> 00:15.281
We are in Gavin Volure's home.

00:15.281 --> 00:16.983
He was the C.E.O. of SunStream.

00:16.983 --> 00:18.518
Yeah, I don't know
what that is.

00:18.518 --> 00:20.086
Is this potpourri
or chips?

00:20.086 --> 00:21.187
'Cause I'm gonna
try to eat it.

00:21.187 --> 00:23.456
Volure's a god.

00:23.456 --> 00:25.058
He was the first man
to be on the cover of

00:25.058 --> 00:27.694
"Fortune" and "Jet" magazine
at the same time.

00:27.694 --> 00:29.029
Of course, that was back when "Jet"

00:29.029 --> 00:31.097
was actually about jet ownership.

00:31.097 --> 00:32.531
That magazine took a weird turn.

00:32.531 --> 00:34.601
These are not chips.

00:34.601 --> 00:36.036
Then, he fell off the face of the earth.

00:36.036 --> 00:39.072
Sold SunStream and shut himself
off from the world.

00:39.072 --> 00:42.075
They say he hasn't left his home
in almost three years.

00:42.075 --> 00:43.309
Well, I hope he
shows up for dinner.

00:43.309 --> 00:45.945
He's already here.

00:48.381 --> 00:49.883
Thank you all for
coming tonight.

00:49.883 --> 00:52.719
Because of my... severe agoraphobia

00:52.719 --> 00:55.321
and my... debilitating wealth...

00:56.790 --> 00:59.025
I am forced to bring the world to me

00:59.025 --> 01:02.562
and host dinners for interesting
people from all walks of life:

01:02.562 --> 01:04.464
the world of fashion...

01:04.464 --> 01:05.698
society...

01:05.698 --> 01:06.933
art collecting and yelling.

01:06.933 --> 01:09.569
Why isn't there any good art
in here? Come on!

01:09.569 --> 01:10.637
Business

01:10.637 --> 01:11.638
and historical fiction.

01:11.638 --> 01:12.672
Really?

01:12.672 --> 01:14.007
What if the Germans
had won the war, Lemon?

01:14.007 --> 01:14.996
And the arts.

01:16.376 --> 01:17.944
I'm glad Jack was able to bring you, Liz.

01:17.944 --> 01:19.979
I asked him about you
after I saw your photo

01:19.979 --> 01:21.581
in the Style section of
"The New York Times."

01:24.417 --> 01:26.586
Funny story-- I was only
wearing that because

01:26.586 --> 01:29.055
the fire alarm went off while
I was getting a haircut.

01:29.055 --> 01:30.147
Well, you looked beautiful.

01:31.424 --> 01:33.193
And, as always

01:33.193 --> 01:34.427
I keep one chair empty

01:34.427 --> 01:37.260
to represent our unfulfilled
hopes and dreams.

01:38.198 --> 01:39.365
I'm just kidding.

01:39.365 --> 01:40.400
Eliot Spitzer's hooker couldn't make it.

01:41.434 --> 01:42.936
Now, I want to send my driver

01:42.936 --> 01:44.337
into Manhattan to pick up dessert.

01:44.337 --> 01:45.405
Anybody know a good place for cupcakes?

01:45.405 --> 01:46.506
I think there's...

01:46.506 --> 01:47.607
McEnroe...

01:47.607 --> 01:48.608
give me a break.
I'm on it.

01:48.608 --> 01:50.877
77th and Amsterdam, 68th and Columbus...

01:50.877 --> 01:52.245
1 25th and President Clinton Boulevard.

01:52.245 --> 01:54.447
Also, don't overthink it.

01:54.447 --> 01:56.347
Sara Lee, frozen. Unbelievable.

01:58.000 --> 02:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:19.038 --> 02:21.141
Mr. Jordan, what are you
still doing here?

02:21.141 --> 02:23.376
I don't want to go home, Ken.

02:23.376 --> 02:26.579
You know my two sons, Tracy Jr.
and George Foreman?

02:26.579 --> 02:28.547
They've been acting really weird lately.

02:34.220 --> 02:35.288
Where you going?

02:35.288 --> 02:38.553
N... nowhere.

02:42.362 --> 02:44.998
Those two have never
paid me any attention.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.499
And rightly so.

02:46.499 --> 02:48.831
I'm a strange man who can't be
taken seriously.

02:49.969 --> 02:51.070
Now, they won't let me out of their sight.

02:51.070 --> 02:53.606
Well, maybe they love you.

02:53.606 --> 02:55.508
Nope. Look what the little one made me.

02:55.508 --> 02:56.676
Aw, that's cute.

02:56.676 --> 02:58.645
This is voodoo, Ken!

02:58.645 --> 03:00.480
Those two are up to something.

03:00.480 --> 03:04.450
Sometimes, kids act out
when there's a big change.

03:04.450 --> 03:07.320
I know I was a handful when my family moved

03:07.320 --> 03:10.456
from our farmhouse to that
militia camp in the woods.

03:10.456 --> 03:12.959
Well, there is all
this new money coming in.

03:12.959 --> 03:14.260
And it's not just
from the video game.

03:14.260 --> 03:16.563
It's the tie-ins, the toys

03:16.563 --> 03:18.298
the life-size Tracy Jordan sex doll

03:18.298 --> 03:20.600
that's selling like hotcakes in Japan.

03:20.600 --> 03:24.170
Well, you know what they say:
money is the root of all evil.

03:24.170 --> 03:26.806
I thought that was just the
tagline for my movie

03:26.806 --> 03:27.830
"Death Bank."

03:29.475 --> 03:32.579
I can't believe you're out of the game.

03:32.579 --> 03:34.681
It's like Picasso not painting

03:34.681 --> 03:37.784
or Bruce Willis not combining
action and rock harmonica.

03:37.784 --> 03:39.118
Don't you miss it?

03:39.118 --> 03:41.586
I do, that's why
I'm forming a new company.

03:42.422 --> 03:44.958
wind power...

03:44.958 --> 03:46.993
bandwidth, Chinese market.

03:46.993 --> 03:48.094
Oh, God!

03:48.094 --> 03:50.296
I'm funding the whole thing myself.

03:50.296 --> 03:51.998
Partners... oy.

03:51.998 --> 03:53.466
Jack...

03:53.466 --> 03:55.602
you're drooling. If you want in

03:55.602 --> 03:57.170
I'll make a little room and
pull some strings.

03:57.170 --> 03:59.939
This is the most exciting day of my life.

03:59.939 --> 04:01.274
And I was pulled

04:01.274 --> 04:03.343
onstage once to dance at
a Bruce Springsteen concert.

04:03.343 --> 04:04.444
Welcome aboard.

04:04.444 --> 04:05.545
Just think...

04:05.545 --> 04:07.180
this time next year, you'll be so rich

04:07.180 --> 04:08.881
you can run for political office
without having to pretend

04:08.881 --> 04:10.250
to be a Fundamentalist.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.784
Jack, the car is here.

04:11.784 --> 04:12.919
Oh.

04:12.919 --> 04:15.455
Liz, thank you for coming.

04:15.455 --> 04:16.649
I really enjoyed
your cupcakes.

04:18.057 --> 04:20.459
And because my agoraphobia-
related germ issues prevent

04:20.459 --> 04:23.162
direct human contact,
I wonder if Carl here

04:23.162 --> 04:24.631
might say good night
to you for me?

04:24.631 --> 04:26.199
Carl?

04:26.199 --> 04:28.434
Good night, Liz.

04:28.434 --> 04:29.696
I hope to see you
again soon.

04:32.205 --> 04:34.901
Okay. Good night.

04:39.212 --> 04:40.947
Guys, listen up.

04:40.947 --> 04:42.248
I just got a memo saying that

04:42.248 --> 04:43.850
every floor in the
building has to designate

04:43.850 --> 04:45.118
a floor emergency marshal

04:45.118 --> 04:46.753
for fires,
terrorist attacks

04:46.753 --> 04:48.021
"Cloverfield" monsters.

04:48.021 --> 04:51.090
I can't do it because my head is
too big for the helmet.

04:51.090 --> 04:52.392
So... any volunteers?

04:52.392 --> 04:54.594
No, but you have
a big head.

04:54.594 --> 04:56.796
That's not a burn. I just said that.

04:56.796 --> 04:57.830
Hey, guys.

04:57.830 --> 05:00.099
Cerie, is my phone ringing?

05:00.099 --> 05:04.203
It is. Wow, you have, like, dog ears.

05:04.203 --> 05:05.872
So, are you going to...

05:06.906 --> 05:09.175
Okay.

05:09.175 --> 05:10.543
Hello?

05:10.543 --> 05:12.679
Hey, Liz. It's Gavin Volure.

05:12.679 --> 05:14.380
Oh, hi.

05:14.380 --> 05:16.015
Listen, I only took that napkin because

05:16.015 --> 05:17.550
I wrapped some chicken in it.

05:17.550 --> 05:18.851
That's not why I'm calling.

05:18.851 --> 05:21.154
I just had a good time
with you the other night

05:21.154 --> 05:23.723
and I wondered if you'd like to
come out again this Saturday.

05:23.723 --> 05:24.891
Are you having another party?

05:24.891 --> 05:26.192
No.

05:26.192 --> 05:28.027
Oh.

05:28.027 --> 05:29.629
Well, this must be
what the kids call

05:29.629 --> 05:30.863
a "booty call."

05:30.863 --> 05:33.199
I haven't been out of
the house since 2004

05:33.199 --> 05:34.767
and even I know the kids don't
call it that anymore.

05:35.768 --> 05:37.670
So, uh... what do you say?

05:37.670 --> 05:41.708
Um... yes, I guess. Right?

05:41.708 --> 05:44.877
Okay, I'll send a helicopter to
take you to the train station.

05:44.877 --> 05:45.945
Okay.

05:45.945 --> 05:47.537
Bye.

05:51.184 --> 05:52.549
What the what?

05:57.123 --> 05:58.925
Well, it's gonna be
a beautiful...

05:58.925 --> 06:00.193
sunny day today
and we can expect...

06:00.193 --> 06:01.527
much more of the same
over the next few days...

06:01.527 --> 06:04.097
Authorities came to believe

06:04.097 --> 06:07.133
that the Menendez brothers acted
out of pure greed.

06:07.133 --> 06:09.068
The only thing
standing between them

06:09.068 --> 06:11.137
and tremendous wealth was...

06:11.137 --> 06:12.538
What?

06:12.538 --> 06:14.207
Say it!

06:14.207 --> 06:17.343
Their father, Jose Menendez.

06:17.343 --> 06:19.312
My kids are going to kill me!

06:23.049 --> 06:24.812
Ooh!

06:28.554 --> 06:29.789
Kenneth, what are you doing?

06:29.789 --> 06:31.324
Oh, hello, sir.

06:31.324 --> 06:33.693
I've been taking in laundry
to make extra money.

06:33.693 --> 06:36.763
I just don't let myself read the
t-shirts with off-color slogans.

06:36.763 --> 06:39.165
Laundry? Kenneth, I know
we pay you a living wage.

06:39.165 --> 06:40.633
I fought against it.

06:40.633 --> 06:43.970
Yes, sir, but I've had to send
more money home lately.

06:43.970 --> 06:45.638
There are problems on the farm.

06:45.638 --> 06:48.441
After years of inbreeding,
the pigs are getting violent

06:48.441 --> 06:50.743
and the pig shield around
the house has worn thin.

06:50.743 --> 06:52.845
Kenneth, how much money do
you have in your savings?

06:52.845 --> 06:55.448
Well, let's see...

06:55.448 --> 06:56.582
$80,000.

06:56.582 --> 06:58.151
If you don't include Confederate money.

06:58.151 --> 06:59.285
$4,000.

06:59.285 --> 07:01.721
I'm going to invest that for you.

07:01.721 --> 07:02.922
A friend has presented me

07:02.922 --> 07:04.657
with a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

07:04.657 --> 07:06.025
and I want to include you.

07:06.025 --> 07:08.227
Oh, Mr. Donaghy! Thank you, sir!

07:08.227 --> 07:09.729
After I invest this money

07:09.729 --> 07:11.864
you'll be able to buy your folks a pig moat.

07:14.033 --> 07:17.161
Well, that would be great if
pigs weren't excellent swimmers.

07:21.140 --> 07:24.844
Jack, Gavin Volure just
called and asked me out--

07:24.844 --> 07:26.779
I mean, in--for the weekend.

07:26.779 --> 07:28.681
I thought he might.
He asked if we were involved.

07:28.681 --> 07:30.016
I said you used to have a thing for me

07:30.016 --> 07:31.184
but you were getting over it.

07:31.184 --> 07:33.085
That is what's happening, right?

07:33.085 --> 07:37.056
Yeah. Listen, I kind of told him I'd go.

07:37.056 --> 07:38.391
You should. What's the problem?

07:38.391 --> 07:40.560
I don't know. I'm still tired
from that dinner.

07:40.560 --> 07:42.094
And meeting someone new?

07:42.094 --> 07:44.397
Ugh, all the nodding and smiling
and sibling listing.

07:44.397 --> 07:45.698
And what's the upside?

07:45.698 --> 07:47.467
It works and you have
to have a bunch of sex?

07:47.467 --> 07:48.901
Lemon, what do you want?

07:48.901 --> 07:50.369
Do you want to be alone for
the rest of your life?

07:50.369 --> 07:54.273
No, I just wish I could start a
relationship about 12 years in

07:54.273 --> 07:55.808
when you really don't have
to try anymore.

07:55.808 --> 07:57.777
And you can just sit around
together and goof on TV shows

07:57.777 --> 08:00.346
and then go to bed without anybody trying

08:00.346 --> 08:02.515
any funny business.

08:02.515 --> 08:04.517
Lemon, don't over-think this.
Gavin is a fabulous guy.

08:04.517 --> 08:06.385
If I were dating a man, he would
be at the top of my list

08:06.385 --> 08:09.121
with Michael Jordan,
Denzel Washington, Taye Diggs...

08:09.121 --> 08:11.624
God, do I have a black thing?

08:11.624 --> 08:13.326
I do like him.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.194
Lemon? You're going to go to Gavin's

08:15.194 --> 08:16.796
and you're going to work this
thing like a Chinese gymnast--

08:16.796 --> 08:20.095
Wear something tight, force a
smile... and lie about your age.

08:25.171 --> 08:29.442
Hey, guys...

08:29.442 --> 08:32.879
Daddy's home.

08:32.879 --> 08:34.403
Don't Menendez me.

08:41.087 --> 08:43.556
We made the hockey team!

08:46.392 --> 08:47.994
And, uh, this is the study.

08:47.994 --> 08:49.462
Oh, this is interesting.

08:49.462 --> 08:51.097
Uh... one of these benches
is a priceless work of art

08:51.097 --> 08:52.865
and the other is

08:52.865 --> 08:54.033
an ordinary bench from which to admire it.

08:54.033 --> 08:55.432
Which one is which?

08:57.036 --> 09:00.406
So you just never
leave this house?

09:00.406 --> 09:01.641
Uh, I'm afraid not.

09:01.641 --> 09:03.109
And it does get lonely.

09:03.109 --> 09:05.511
I'd be lying if I told you
I've never danced with a broom.

09:05.511 --> 09:06.979
That's nothing.

09:06.979 --> 09:08.748
Sometimes, to feel like
I have company during dinner

09:08.748 --> 09:11.751
I dispute credit card
charges on speakerphone.

09:11.751 --> 09:13.319
Thanks for coming up.

09:13.319 --> 09:15.788
I know my situation is complicated

09:15.788 --> 09:17.657
but, uh, I really enjoyed
your company the other night.

09:17.657 --> 09:20.293
I had a great time, too.

09:20.293 --> 09:22.662
So with your
agoraphobia...

09:22.662 --> 09:25.131
how does this... work?

09:25.131 --> 09:27.667
Well... it's not easy.

09:27.667 --> 09:29.602
We can never leave the house.

09:29.602 --> 09:32.638
And we'd just probably sit
around all weekend and watch TV.

09:32.638 --> 09:33.940
Go on.

09:33.940 --> 09:35.775
There's not much else to do up here but eat

09:35.775 --> 09:38.811
and read celebrity gossip on the
internet and nap the day away.

09:38.811 --> 09:40.379
Really?

09:40.379 --> 09:43.282
And, unfortunately, uh, because of my phobias

09:43.282 --> 09:46.352
we could never be physically intimate.

09:46.352 --> 09:48.187
I know.

09:48.187 --> 09:51.023
What woman would
want all that?

09:51.023 --> 09:52.158
Um...

09:52.158 --> 09:53.559
Oh, hello, Kenneth.

09:53.559 --> 09:54.827
Please, sit down.

09:54.827 --> 09:56.662
I'm sorry to bother you, Mr. Donaghy

09:56.662 --> 09:58.998
but I've got another $10 I'd like to invest.

09:58.998 --> 10:02.401
I did some street performing in
my neighborhood this weekend.

10:08.040 --> 10:11.844
Kenneth, I'm very proud of you.
Next stop, home ownership.

10:11.844 --> 10:13.179
I'm just kidding.

10:13.179 --> 10:15.081
The middle class is dying.
You'll be renting forever.

10:16.415 --> 10:19.318
Uh, let's just call my broker.

10:19.318 --> 10:20.987
Hey, Jack.

10:20.987 --> 10:22.488
Hey, Walter, I just want
to check on an investment

10:22.488 --> 10:24.123
I made on Friday.

10:24.123 --> 10:25.157
All right, let's pull it up.

10:26.559 --> 10:28.427
Uh, that... that account
was closed out.

10:28.427 --> 10:29.729
What?

10:29.729 --> 10:31.631
Yeah, zero balance
as of this morning.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.633
I don't know what, uh...
that hot tip was

10:33.633 --> 10:35.034
but you'd have been better off
putting that money

10:35.034 --> 10:36.335
in a coffee can.

10:36.335 --> 10:38.104
Hi, Walter.

10:38.104 --> 10:40.640
This is Kenneth Parcell, NBC page program.

10:40.640 --> 10:45.441
What's the status of my investment?

10:46.879 --> 10:50.182
Gavin,
this was wonderful.

10:50.182 --> 10:53.219
I really enjoyed watching
MTV Canada with you.

10:53.219 --> 10:54.654
Yeah.

10:54.654 --> 10:57.123
They can't seem to get anything
right up there, can they?

10:57.123 --> 10:59.925
I hope you'll come back.
Maybe next weekend?

10:59.925 --> 11:00.960
I'd like that.

11:00.960 --> 11:02.261
Me, too.

11:02.261 --> 11:03.829
Well, I should go.

11:03.829 --> 11:05.765
Do you have everything?
Do you have your cell phone?

11:05.765 --> 11:06.866
Oh, um...

11:06.866 --> 11:09.435
Oh... nerds.
Where is it?

11:09.435 --> 11:11.671
Oh, uh... there it is, in the other room.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.472
Carl?

11:13.472 --> 11:14.774
Could you get Liz's
cell phone for her

11:14.774 --> 11:16.342
so I can say a proper goodbye?

11:16.342 --> 11:18.611
Thanks, buddy.

11:18.611 --> 11:21.546
Anyway, I just...

11:25.284 --> 11:26.819
We don't have much time, Liz!

11:26.819 --> 11:27.953
What?

11:27.953 --> 11:29.422
Look, Liz, I've decided
I can trust you

11:29.422 --> 11:30.489
so I'm going to tell you
the truth.

11:30.489 --> 11:32.291
I'm not really an eccentric agoraphobe.

11:32.291 --> 11:33.993
I just tell people that so they won't know

11:33.993 --> 11:36.195
I'm under house arrest
for tax fraud... and arson.

11:36.195 --> 11:37.897
Volure!

11:37.897 --> 11:40.166
Ah! The wind must have
blown it shut, Carl!

11:40.166 --> 11:41.801
I'm searching for the key!

11:41.801 --> 11:43.098
Carl's a U.S. Marshal.

11:43.869 --> 11:45.234
Come, before they shoot!

11:49.308 --> 11:52.111
I thought Derek was upstairs!

11:52.111 --> 11:54.680
I miscounted the men, Liz!

11:54.680 --> 11:56.807
I miscounted the men!

11:57.883 --> 11:59.085
Gavin, it's Jack.

11:59.085 --> 12:00.419
Please call me immediately.

12:00.419 --> 12:02.655
Also, that joke answering
machine message makes me

12:02.655 --> 12:04.056
really think you've picked up.

12:04.056 --> 12:06.258
So, I start talking and then
it beeps and, uh...

12:06.258 --> 12:07.860
I feel like a fool.

12:07.860 --> 12:10.162
Hey, your friend is a crook.

12:10.162 --> 12:11.997
He's under house arrest
for tax fraud, embezzlement

12:11.997 --> 12:13.933
and racketeering.

12:13.933 --> 12:15.434
What is racketeering?!

12:15.434 --> 12:16.569
No one knows, Lemon.

12:16.569 --> 12:17.837
And he's not
a germaphobe!

12:17.837 --> 12:19.438
I thought I was helping him
when I let him

12:19.438 --> 12:21.607
hold my boob while
we watched "Top Chef."

12:21.607 --> 12:23.142
Oh, I'm sorry.

12:23.142 --> 12:24.577
You should be.
You made me go up there.

12:24.577 --> 12:25.811
Well, I'm going to fix this.

12:25.811 --> 12:27.379
I'm going to get Kenneth
his money back, and for you

12:27.379 --> 12:29.248
I'm going to hit Gavin Volure harder

12:29.248 --> 12:32.651
than a bottle of whiskey
at an Irish wake.

12:32.651 --> 12:33.719
Tracy, get out of the hallway.

12:33.719 --> 12:35.588
Or am I?

12:35.588 --> 12:37.356
Oh, God, this dream again?

12:37.356 --> 12:38.591
That's not me.

12:38.591 --> 12:41.060
That's the Tracy Jordan
Japanese sex doll.

12:41.060 --> 12:42.595
You can tell us apart because

12:42.595 --> 12:44.864
it's not suffering from
a vitamin deficiency.

12:44.864 --> 12:46.465
Other than the natural inclination

12:46.465 --> 12:48.400
to make love to yourself,
why did you get this?

12:48.400 --> 12:49.869
To use as a decoy.

12:49.869 --> 12:51.303
So my greedy children

12:51.303 --> 12:54.373
will murder it and I'll be able
to escape un-Menendezed.

12:54.373 --> 12:55.474
This is insanity.

12:55.474 --> 12:56.609
Or is it?

12:56.609 --> 12:58.077
The parallels between

12:58.077 --> 13:00.112
the Jordans and the "Menendai" are uncanny.

13:00.112 --> 13:04.383
Both families are rich,
both families have two sons

13:04.383 --> 13:07.987
and both families are staples of Court TV.

13:07.987 --> 13:10.823
Money does make people crazy.
Look at Gavin.

13:10.823 --> 13:13.292
And he doesn't have the lifelong
scarring of an absentee father.

13:13.292 --> 13:14.316
Exactly!

13:16.562 --> 13:18.530
You want to get one? I can get you one.

13:20.566 --> 13:22.735
You've got 10 seconds, Volure.

13:22.735 --> 13:24.837
I'm sorry, Jack, but I needed
that money for my escape.

13:24.837 --> 13:25.938
And it's all gone.

13:25.938 --> 13:27.106
I spent it...

13:27.106 --> 13:28.641
on disguises.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.743
What about your billions?
What about SunStream?

13:30.743 --> 13:32.945
SunStream is why I'm trapped here.

13:32.945 --> 13:34.613
It's not a real company.

13:34.613 --> 13:36.877
If you watch our commercials, we
never actually say what we did.

13:38.083 --> 13:39.118
Innovation...

13:39.118 --> 13:40.486
tomorrow...

13:40.486 --> 13:42.588
America...

13:42.588 --> 13:44.490
SunStream.

13:44.490 --> 13:46.725
You can't be broke. What about this house?

13:46.725 --> 13:48.160
The government owns this house.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.896
I share it with three other
white-collar criminals.

13:50.896 --> 13:54.133
Hey, Glenn! That's my peanut butter!

13:54.133 --> 13:55.901
God, you're pathetic.

13:55.901 --> 13:58.637
Creamy? This is, this is not my pea...

13:58.637 --> 14:01.540
I'm sorry, Glenn.

14:01.540 --> 14:03.876
I know. I'm pathetic.

14:03.876 --> 14:07.012
But I never meant to hurt Liz.

14:07.012 --> 14:09.114
I miss her, Jack.

14:09.114 --> 14:11.584
I miss her laughter, her voice...

14:11.584 --> 14:13.219
the sound of
her scratching

14:13.219 --> 14:16.555
her dry elbow skin all the way up... ow!

14:16.555 --> 14:18.257
Damn it!

14:18.257 --> 14:21.393
I have got a serious case of the Mondays!

14:21.393 --> 14:23.229
Gavin, you're going to have
to make this thing right.

14:23.229 --> 14:25.030
I will, Jack,
I promise.

14:25.030 --> 14:27.967
We trusted you, Gavin.

14:27.967 --> 14:29.835
I know,
good point.

14:29.835 --> 14:31.437
And you betrayed us.

14:31.437 --> 14:34.640
Wow, that's
wonderful news!

14:34.640 --> 14:35.664
Gavin?

14:36.842 --> 14:39.411
Gavin, what are you doing in there?

14:39.411 --> 14:41.747
Yep! You and me both, pal!

14:41.747 --> 14:44.016
I'll just be a minute.

14:44.016 --> 14:45.284
Carl!

14:45.284 --> 14:47.386
Gosh, these acoustics
in here are fantastic!

14:47.386 --> 14:51.724
# Tomorrow, tomorrow, I'll love you?

14:51.724 --> 14:55.728
# Tomorrow, it's only a day,
doh-doh-day...?

14:55.728 --> 14:58.288
Uh, Kenneth?

14:59.598 --> 15:01.834
I couldn't get your money
back and I'm sorry.

15:01.834 --> 15:05.137
I feel responsible,
so I want you to have this.

15:05.137 --> 15:07.439
Mr. Donaghy, I can't take that.

15:07.439 --> 15:09.541
Well, what would this country be
if our economy didn't allow

15:09.541 --> 15:11.877
wealthy people to take
advantage of rubes?

15:11.877 --> 15:13.679
Well, yes, that's true, but what
about your family?

15:13.679 --> 15:15.614
Oh, don't worry about us.

15:15.614 --> 15:19.285
We Parcells have eaten our share
of rock soup and squirrel tail.

15:19.285 --> 15:22.554
But we've also known lean times.
We'll get by.

15:22.554 --> 15:24.023
Kenneth!

15:24.023 --> 15:28.160
I need someone to be
our floor emergency marshal.

15:28.160 --> 15:30.062
And you came to me first?

15:30.062 --> 15:31.086
Thank you, sir!

15:32.364 --> 15:35.200
Uh, Pete... doesn't that
responsibility come with

15:35.200 --> 15:36.802
a $4,000 signing bonus?

15:36.802 --> 15:37.791
Uh...

15:38.737 --> 15:40.639
yes?

15:40.639 --> 15:42.808
Oh, right, I remember
that meeting...

15:42.808 --> 15:47.336
where you also said I would get
a per diem for gas.

15:50.649 --> 15:53.919
Yes. Yes, um... 12 cents a mile.

15:53.919 --> 15:56.183
Yes! Hornberger!

15:58.223 --> 16:02.528
Yes... Hornberger.

16:02.528 --> 16:05.931
Tracy Jr: Daddy?

16:05.931 --> 16:08.024
It begins.

16:11.203 --> 16:13.605
Daddy, are you awake?

16:13.605 --> 16:16.408
I keep having this scary dream.

16:16.408 --> 16:18.944
I dreamed that you'll get
so rich that you leave us

16:18.944 --> 16:20.346
and get a new family

16:20.346 --> 16:22.214
and never come back.

16:22.214 --> 16:24.383
And, Daddy, I don't want you to leave us

16:24.383 --> 16:25.782
'cause I love you.

16:26.919 --> 16:28.153
I love you so much.

16:28.153 --> 16:29.421
I love you too, son!

16:31.090 --> 16:32.057
Stop it!

16:33.025 --> 16:36.562
Stop "patriciding!" It's me!

16:36.562 --> 16:38.030
There's nothing to be
freaked out about!

16:38.030 --> 16:40.766
That's just a Japanese
sex doll in Daddy's bed.

16:40.766 --> 16:42.668
Now, you listen.

16:42.668 --> 16:44.470
You don't have to ever
worry about me leaving

16:44.470 --> 16:46.605
'cause I'll always be there
to take care of you.

16:46.605 --> 16:48.574
And there's something else.

16:48.574 --> 16:51.243
If anything ever happens to me...

16:51.243 --> 16:55.680
you and your brother are going to go to jail.

16:59.585 --> 17:00.919
Liz Lemon!

17:00.919 --> 17:02.588
Look!

17:02.588 --> 17:04.857
I'm not dead.

17:04.857 --> 17:06.358
Good to know.

17:06.358 --> 17:08.193
Yes, it is.

17:08.193 --> 17:10.529
Oh, also, everything worked out
with Jenna's dad visiting.

17:10.529 --> 17:11.630
What?

17:11.630 --> 17:13.097
Oh, you weren't really around
for any of that.

17:13.832 --> 17:15.968
Cast to the stage
for rehearsal.

17:15.968 --> 17:18.369
Cast to the stage...

17:18.369 --> 17:19.905
Hello, Liz.

17:19.905 --> 17:22.241
Oh, my God! Gavin?

17:22.241 --> 17:23.275
Shh.

17:23.275 --> 17:24.943
We're supposed to be quiet
during rehearsal.

17:24.943 --> 17:26.912
What are you doing here?

17:26.912 --> 17:28.047
I came back for you, Liz.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.277
I was free. I was across the Canadian border.

17:30.349 --> 17:31.717
No, you weren't. What's the scam?

17:31.717 --> 17:32.885
Do you want money?

17:32.885 --> 17:35.888
No, I'm not lying. I can prove it-- look.

17:35.888 --> 17:38.152
Cheap cholesterol medicine from Canada...

17:39.158 --> 17:42.161
a Paris Hilton film released only in Canada.

17:42.161 --> 17:44.830
"Camp of Approval"?
What does that even mean?

17:44.830 --> 17:47.032
Liz, what's the point of being
free if you're alone?

17:47.032 --> 17:48.233
You get me.

17:48.233 --> 17:50.002
Come with me to Canada.

17:50.002 --> 17:53.005
Toronto is just like New York
but without all the stuff.

17:53.005 --> 17:54.239
Absolutely not.

17:54.239 --> 17:55.228
Volure.

17:56.842 --> 17:59.111
I thought by now, you'd be some
place that U.S. Iaw

17:59.111 --> 18:01.280
couldn't touch you, like Bali or Utah.

18:01.280 --> 18:03.048
What made you come back?

18:03.048 --> 18:04.950
The reason is standing right next to you.

18:04.950 --> 18:06.618
I came back for Liz.

18:06.618 --> 18:07.653
Liz isn't going
anywhere, Volure.

18:07.653 --> 18:08.654
I already told him that.

18:08.654 --> 18:09.988
You've already
done enough damage

18:09.988 --> 18:11.657
taking advantage of
her loneliness

18:11.657 --> 18:13.859
and her Big Ben-sized
biological clock.

18:13.859 --> 18:15.260
Oh, come on.

18:15.260 --> 18:17.029
I'm stopping it.
I can't believe I'm saying this

18:17.029 --> 18:19.431
to the great Gavin Volure, but
Liz Lemon is too good for you.

18:19.431 --> 18:20.766
Oh, well, that is nice.

18:20.766 --> 18:23.135
It's over, Volure. Give me the brush.

18:23.135 --> 18:25.838
You stay back. I swear I will paint you.

18:25.838 --> 18:26.972
I am not going

18:26.972 --> 18:28.140
to real prison.

18:28.140 --> 18:29.441
I've lost everything.

18:29.441 --> 18:31.500
I'm financially ruined. I've lost Liz.

18:32.311 --> 18:34.279
That paint is drying weird.

18:34.279 --> 18:35.747
And now, prison?

18:35.747 --> 18:36.907
Not prison...

18:38.150 --> 18:41.820
not for Gavin Volure.

18:41.820 --> 18:45.557
What are you doing?

18:45.557 --> 18:46.558
Get down from there!

18:46.558 --> 18:47.926
Good God, Volure.

18:47.926 --> 18:49.257
That's gotta be 15, 16 feet!

18:50.195 --> 18:51.930
Everybody, stand back.

18:51.930 --> 18:53.932
Gavin Volure is gonna jump!

18:53.932 --> 18:56.924
We need the floor emergency marshal!

19:03.575 --> 19:07.045
Gavin Volure! Everybody wanted
to be Gavin Volure!

19:07.045 --> 19:08.247
Volure, calm down.

19:08.247 --> 19:09.681
Gavin, don't do this.

19:09.681 --> 19:11.650
All right, everyone, I'm in charge!

19:11.650 --> 19:14.086
Does anyone need
water or saltines?

19:14.086 --> 19:16.588
I would feel safer with some saltines.

19:16.588 --> 19:18.223
I had the money.

19:18.223 --> 19:20.392
I had the yacht, I had the women.

19:20.392 --> 19:22.895
I had it all and then I lost it!

19:22.895 --> 19:25.130
And now... I'm gonna jump!

19:25.130 --> 19:26.632
Gavin, listen to me.

19:26.632 --> 19:28.267
I know you've had some setbacks lately.

19:28.267 --> 19:29.902
Glenn ate all my peanut butter!

19:29.902 --> 19:31.537
Gavin, I'm not gonna lie to you.

19:31.537 --> 19:33.939
You'll probably be killed in
the first six months of prison.

19:33.939 --> 19:35.574
But that's neither here nor there.

19:35.574 --> 19:37.042
The important thing is that you're alive now

19:37.042 --> 19:38.110
which means there's hope.

19:38.110 --> 19:40.445
You know? You're making a lot of sense.

19:40.445 --> 19:42.381
Yes, you have to pay for
the things you've done.

19:42.381 --> 19:44.616
You're not making sense anymore!

19:44.616 --> 19:45.851
In spite of everything

19:45.851 --> 19:47.452
you still have friends who will stand by you.

19:47.452 --> 19:51.423
And, more importantly, perhaps
most importantly of all...

19:51.423 --> 19:52.558
Now, Tracy!

19:54.126 --> 19:58.630
What? But you're down there.

19:58.630 --> 20:00.427
Or am I?

20:04.069 --> 20:05.900
Good job, sex doll.

20:12.077 --> 20:13.977
He miscounted the men.

20:15.314 --> 20:17.749
You know, a lot of people
look down on sex dolls.

20:17.749 --> 20:19.351
But as we saw tonight

20:19.351 --> 20:21.787
they save lives and bring families together.

20:21.787 --> 20:26.325
How am I such an expert?
I'm Tracy Jordan's sex doll.

20:26.325 --> 20:29.590
All right,
let's do this!
