00:55.212 --> 00:57.949
Isaac Lemay
roamed the Great Plains

00:57.982 --> 01:01.919
in western territories,
taking up with whores

01:01.953 --> 01:04.554
and siring children
across the land

01:04.587 --> 01:06.589
without thought to consequence.

01:08.125 --> 01:11.561
He gained employment clearing
Cheyenne for the army

01:11.594 --> 01:13.898
and it was the
ugliness of this task

01:13.931 --> 01:15.199
which turned him to ruin.

01:17.201 --> 01:20.171
For his crimes the Cheyenne
chief White Thunder

01:20.204 --> 01:22.839
cursed him to be
killed by his own seed.

01:24.241 --> 01:28.745
Haunted, he tracked down
his children one by one

01:30.114 --> 01:34.018
to kill them before they
did the same to him.

01:39.015 --> 01:41.515
{\an3}<font color="#FFFFFF">!!! Hope you enjoy the show !!!</font>

02:34.711 --> 02:35.578
Lionel!

03:14.351 --> 03:17.121
Rumor is there's a
man from the plains

03:17.154 --> 03:19.356
goin' around
killing his own kin.

03:21.258 --> 03:25.296
Says he come back here to
wipe his seed from the earth.

03:28.933 --> 03:30.633
You heard this rumor?

03:37.908 --> 03:41.045
The man carries an
ivory handled Colt.

03:42.413 --> 03:44.215
Much like the one
you're carrying.

03:54.691 --> 03:59.696
Finish the whiskey and leave.

04:50.780 --> 04:53.750
What do you want from me?

04:53.783 --> 04:55.452
I've done nothing wrong.

05:16.340 --> 05:18.342
You were born.

06:12.496 --> 06:15.966
Get out. We
ain't finished yet.

06:19.003 --> 06:20.537
What the hell?

06:20.571 --> 06:21.905
Get...

06:21.939 --> 06:22.906
I ain't done.

06:23.607 --> 06:24.942
Go on, here.

06:34.551 --> 06:35.419
Poor Lionel.

06:37.887 --> 06:38.989
He didn't deserve that.

06:42.426 --> 06:44.295
Tell me about the twin.

06:48.399 --> 06:49.400
There is no twin.

07:15.359 --> 07:16.960
What's his name?

07:22.933 --> 07:24.902
You got some bad information.

08:02.439 --> 08:05.142
Look what that fucker did to me!

08:07.444 --> 08:09.246
Somebody kill that motherfucker!

08:11.048 --> 08:12.282
Why don't you kill
yourself, Lemay!

08:12.316 --> 08:13.650
You're the devil!

08:15.552 --> 08:17.154
- You're gonna do something?
- Come on, come on.

08:17.187 --> 08:18.922
You're gonna let him
get away with that!

08:18.956 --> 08:20.057
Are you really gonna let
him get away with that?

08:20.090 --> 08:22.259
He cut off my fucking thumb.

08:22.292 --> 08:26.563
Somebody do something!

08:58.662 --> 08:59.563
Can I help you?

09:03.700 --> 09:04.701
You Coleman?

09:04.735 --> 09:05.936
Yeah, I'm Coleman.

09:08.539 --> 09:09.573
Looking for Claire.

09:11.575 --> 09:12.443
Who are you?

09:18.282 --> 09:20.050
I'm her old friend.

09:42.172 --> 09:43.574
What's that you said outside?

09:43.607 --> 09:45.242
You're old friends with Claire.

09:48.745 --> 09:50.547
Well, those days have passed.

09:52.583 --> 09:54.985
She'll be coming back
from church real soon now.

09:59.356 --> 10:00.224
You sit tight.

10:08.365 --> 10:09.399
Hello, father.

10:10.667 --> 10:11.668
My daughter Megan.

10:48.105 --> 10:49.239
How old are you again?

10:50.874 --> 10:51.742
16.

11:01.518 --> 11:02.553
How do you know mama?

11:15.465 --> 11:16.500
Are you a gold miner?

11:18.502 --> 11:19.436
No, I'm a hunter.

11:56.440 --> 11:57.307
She's mine.

11:58.675 --> 11:59.743
She's not.

12:04.181 --> 12:07.451
She got the mark on her neck?

12:07.484 --> 12:09.519
She doesn't have a mark.

12:12.222 --> 12:15.225
You know what I'm
gonna do to her?

12:18.629 --> 12:20.163
There's rumors about you.

12:22.532 --> 12:23.367
Yeah?

12:23.400 --> 12:24.735
At church.

12:24.768 --> 12:26.403
At church.

12:26.436 --> 12:28.305
You go to church?

12:28.338 --> 12:31.541
They say you've
been cursed by Cheyenne.

12:33.477 --> 12:35.746
That you're to be killed
by the hand of your son.

12:40.217 --> 12:42.185
By my child?

12:42.219 --> 12:43.487
She isn't yours.

12:45.656 --> 12:47.524
She's never hurt a
thing in her life.

12:49.526 --> 12:50.394
Yeah?

12:53.764 --> 12:56.633
She's
nothing like you.

12:59.904 --> 13:01.238
Yeah she is.

13:09.013 --> 13:10.881
In your fucking house!

14:56.087 --> 14:57.454
You scared me.

15:10.101 --> 15:11.434
You're cold.

15:41.698 --> 15:42.766
Come with me.

15:45.102 --> 15:47.972
Tell you something
you wanna know.

16:21.205 --> 16:23.941
Out there, past those mountains,

16:25.642 --> 16:26.877
lies the plains.

16:31.815 --> 16:34.018
And that is where
I met your mama.

16:35.719 --> 16:37.154
And that is where you are from.

16:39.456 --> 16:40.124
There.

16:42.927 --> 16:43.928
You feel it?

17:01.212 --> 17:03.114
We don't have the
power to stop it.

17:11.554 --> 17:12.589
Power to stop what?

17:17.493 --> 17:21.464
What?

17:21.498 --> 17:24.234
I'm not gonna let him
harm our daughter.

17:24.268 --> 17:25.602
My daughter.

17:32.243 --> 17:33.978
You go out there,
he'll kill you.

17:46.157 --> 17:47.024
Here.

17:49.060 --> 17:49.927
Here.

17:51.561 --> 17:52.229
Go on.

18:01.538 --> 18:03.074
You feel it?

18:03.107 --> 18:07.111
You feel it?

18:09.813 --> 18:10.680
Go on.

18:30.167 --> 18:33.570
You're not the one
who's gonna kill me.

19:07.204 --> 19:08.339
What did you do
to my daughter?

19:08.372 --> 19:09.639
She's fine.

20:30.187 --> 20:35.159
Where's the bank manager?

20:43.766 --> 20:46.904
Do you know where
the bank manager is?

20:49.173 --> 20:51.242
You don't know either, huh?

21:04.355 --> 21:05.755
What about you?

21:09.193 --> 21:11.828
Do you know where
the bank manager is?

21:38.422 --> 21:41.025
Can you come on out
here for me, sir?

21:53.370 --> 21:54.238
Nice to meet you.

21:56.106 --> 21:57.341
You got a nice place here.

21:59.210 --> 22:00.810
Aw, chin up man.

22:00.843 --> 22:01.711
You look good.

22:05.149 --> 22:06.016
That's nice.

22:12.456 --> 22:13.324
Ma'am.

22:16.293 --> 22:19.762
Take a kneel for me, sir.

22:21.198 --> 22:22.099
Get on your knees.

22:27.171 --> 22:28.372
Thank you.

22:41.986 --> 22:42.852
Ma'am.

22:55.832 --> 22:58.435
He was born along
with his twin brother Lionel

22:58.469 --> 23:00.404
in the year 1858.

23:02.072 --> 23:04.375
Unwilling to raise
him in a brothel,

23:04.408 --> 23:08.512
his mother abandoned him at the
Virginia City Home for Boys.

23:10.347 --> 23:13.984
Over the years, she would
visit him at the orphanage,

23:14.018 --> 23:15.785
but never requested custody.

23:29.466 --> 23:31.602
Logan's gonna try.

23:31.635 --> 23:32.970
Can't waste the ammo.

24:09.273 --> 24:14.278
Who the hell is out there?

24:16.080 --> 24:17.114
Son of a bitch!

24:17.147 --> 24:18.048
I knew it was you!

24:19.383 --> 24:21.185
You son of a whore!

24:41.271 --> 24:43.340
Would you look at that.

24:45.609 --> 24:47.544
Oh, he's as innocent
as a newborn lamb.

24:51.281 --> 24:52.149
Hi.

24:55.486 --> 24:57.887
Now, why would you do that?

25:11.068 --> 25:13.303
I like your name.

25:13.337 --> 25:14.438
Does the job.

25:56.413 --> 25:58.081
What happened?

26:00.417 --> 26:02.019
You need to leave town.

26:04.254 --> 26:05.122
Who did this?

26:08.225 --> 26:09.092
Your father.

26:10.694 --> 26:11.728
He's looking for you.

26:14.298 --> 26:15.165
What's he want?

26:19.403 --> 26:20.704
Brooks, Canada in a month.

26:21.638 --> 26:23.240
Just as we planned.

26:23.273 --> 26:24.241
Just we can't go
together anymore.

26:24.274 --> 26:25.776
I'll meet you there.

26:25.809 --> 26:26.777
Y'all finished?

26:26.810 --> 26:28.011
Fuck you. Get out.

26:43.360 --> 26:46.296
I want you to come
and live with me.

26:46.330 --> 26:47.431
I need to protect you.

26:48.832 --> 26:50.067
But I'm not the one
in need of protecting.

26:50.100 --> 26:52.035
I ain't scared of him.

26:52.069 --> 26:53.270
I ain't scared of no one.

26:56.673 --> 26:57.641
You go alone.

26:58.575 --> 27:00.277
I'll meet you there.

27:19.563 --> 27:21.732
Why don't I stay here tonight?

27:21.765 --> 27:22.633
You can't.

27:30.240 --> 27:35.245
What if I was a customer?

27:39.683 --> 27:42.419
Why you always want me to leave?

27:43.687 --> 27:45.489
Because I love you.

27:53.497 --> 27:55.365
What does that mean?

27:59.503 --> 28:01.238
What does that mean?

28:08.645 --> 28:10.547
Think Cal got some.

28:10.581 --> 28:11.815
Sure looks like it.

28:11.848 --> 28:12.716
He looks worn.

28:13.817 --> 28:15.452
You with Anna?

28:15.485 --> 28:17.287
Anna is one hell of
a whore, I tell you.

28:17.321 --> 28:18.855
One hell of a whore.

29:13.978 --> 29:15.612
You want a cigarette?

29:20.283 --> 29:24.287
I'm such a fool for thinking
I could've been a mother.

29:25.822 --> 29:26.924
Can't blame yourself.

29:29.493 --> 29:30.694
He wasn't always wrong.

29:31.628 --> 29:32.763
Not when he was little.

29:34.731 --> 29:36.333
I'm sure you done your best.

29:40.404 --> 29:41.672
I just wanna know why.

29:43.273 --> 29:44.675
Why what?

29:47.577 --> 29:49.780
Why the devil
won't leave us alone?

31:21.404 --> 31:26.409
Is the curse over?

31:27.844 --> 31:30.847
It's not a curse.

31:30.881 --> 31:31.748
It's a prophecy.

32:21.431 --> 32:22.833
Some sort of game gun.

32:27.939 --> 32:30.007
Not your standard
Sharp's that's for sure.

32:31.508 --> 32:33.743
Shots done point
blank with a big gun.

32:36.080 --> 32:38.115
Them holes in
Wilson, that's a 45.

32:41.152 --> 32:42.019
No hurry.

32:43.087 --> 32:44.487
Walked straight up to these two.

32:44.521 --> 32:45.923
Boom. Boom.

32:45.957 --> 32:46.823
Three men.

32:48.893 --> 32:50.393
But only one shoots.

32:52.897 --> 32:54.932
Still can't believe
you grew up Indian.

32:56.700 --> 32:57.767
What'd they do to you?

33:00.137 --> 33:01.072
They raised me.

33:04.608 --> 33:06.443
It's a perfect
spot for an ambush.

33:07.178 --> 33:08.845
Not amateurs, then?

33:08.879 --> 33:10.480
Not amateurs.

33:10.513 --> 33:14.718
Whoever did this
to my men, my men.

33:14.751 --> 33:17.121
Not telling what he'll
do with my Gatling gun.

33:17.154 --> 33:18.855
Criminal isn't trained.

33:18.889 --> 33:20.091
Won't be able to work it.

33:21.658 --> 33:24.061
You'd be surprised
at what people can do.

33:36.606 --> 33:38.475
That's the last of 'em.

33:38.508 --> 33:40.844
Every soldier trained on the
Gatling gun in the region.

33:42.213 --> 33:43.680
You want some kind
of help with these?

33:43.713 --> 33:44.681
Look at this.

33:44.714 --> 33:46.650
Name Cal Talisker.

33:46.683 --> 33:48.551
Raised as an orphan
in Virginia City.

33:48.585 --> 33:52.522
Joined the army and trained as
a loader on the Gatling gun.

33:52.555 --> 33:57.560
Discharged for lying about
his age and insubordination.

33:58.795 --> 34:00.463
Look who his
superior officer was.

34:01.999 --> 34:02.866
Wilson.

34:07.905 --> 34:08.804
Where you going?

34:11.275 --> 34:12.742
Virginia City.

34:34.563 --> 34:35.565
The devil,

34:39.070 --> 34:39.937
the devil,

34:41.138 --> 34:42.005
the devil,

34:43.306 --> 34:44.175
the devil,

34:45.742 --> 34:46.609
the devil,

34:47.877 --> 34:48.745
the devil,

34:49.879 --> 34:50.746
the devil,

34:52.116 --> 34:53.050
the devil,

34:53.083 --> 34:54.251
Mama?

34:54.284 --> 34:55.485
The devil,

34:56.553 --> 34:57.221
the devil,

34:59.123 --> 34:59.991
the devil,

35:01.758 --> 35:02.625
the devil,

35:04.561 --> 35:05.229
the devil,

35:06.596 --> 35:07.965
the devil,

35:07.999 --> 35:08.865
the devil,

35:10.001 --> 35:11.235
the devil,

35:11.268 --> 35:12.869
the devil,

35:12.903 --> 35:13.770
the devil,

35:15.239 --> 35:16.107
the devil,

35:17.208 --> 35:18.742
the devil,

35:18.775 --> 35:20.177
the devil,

35:20.211 --> 35:21.078
the devil,

35:22.013 --> 35:22.879
the devil,

35:24.148 --> 35:25.016
the devil,

35:26.716 --> 35:27.584
the devil,

35:28.651 --> 35:29.519
the devil,

35:31.821 --> 35:32.689
the devil!

35:33.823 --> 35:34.959
Oh, the devil!

35:36.894 --> 35:37.761
The devil!

35:39.930 --> 35:40.797
The devil!

35:58.648 --> 36:00.951
Good lord, Solomon.

36:00.985 --> 36:02.119
What brings you by?

36:03.254 --> 36:05.855
Buck, mind if we speak?

36:05.889 --> 36:07.024
Yeah, sure as hell do.

36:08.691 --> 36:09.692
What's on your mind?

36:10.760 --> 36:12.229
I need your help.

36:13.696 --> 36:14.564
Really?

36:15.933 --> 36:17.700
I'm
looking for a man.

36:17.734 --> 36:19.003
A man with a whore mother.

36:20.637 --> 36:22.772
He been causing some
trouble around here

36:22.806 --> 36:25.608
and stole some of
my army equipment.

36:25.642 --> 36:29.712
Oh, I haven't seen anybody
matching that description.

36:31.115 --> 36:32.950
Any other
problems around here?

36:34.251 --> 36:36.020
We did have a murder
the other night.

36:36.053 --> 36:37.354
- Murder?
- Yeah.

36:37.388 --> 36:39.223
Brutal stabbing in the saloon.

36:40.824 --> 36:42.326
I suspect it had to do
with a gambling debt.

36:44.261 --> 36:45.795
You catch the game?

36:45.829 --> 36:46.696
Nope.

36:46.729 --> 36:47.597
No sign of him.

36:48.731 --> 36:50.901
Uh, just a boy, supposedly.

36:50.935 --> 36:52.336
A boy?

36:52.369 --> 36:53.736
Yeah, 19,
maybe 20 years old.

36:54.737 --> 36:55.605
Hmm.

36:59.709 --> 37:01.245
Which saloon?

37:01.278 --> 37:02.146
The Two-One.

37:18.028 --> 37:19.230
Need another?

37:20.464 --> 37:23.234
I wanna meet your whores.

37:23.267 --> 37:28.272
What's your preference?

38:04.909 --> 38:05.775
Her.

38:22.026 --> 38:27.031
Were you here when the murder
happened the other night?

38:29.967 --> 38:30.968
Was it your boy?

38:36.540 --> 38:37.840
That's why you're here?

38:47.117 --> 38:49.486
Yeah.

38:49.520 --> 38:50.387
Kept it?

38:54.158 --> 38:55.025
Eagle feather.

38:57.860 --> 38:59.029
You shouldn't have this.

39:00.797 --> 39:03.833
I thought it was for
courage, during the hard times.

39:05.802 --> 39:07.770
Many
people thought so.

39:07.804 --> 39:09.139
I love that eagle feather.

39:23.020 --> 39:23.886
Hey.

39:25.990 --> 39:26.924
Made lieutenant.

39:32.862 --> 39:33.863
Are you married?

39:37.101 --> 39:37.968
No.

39:46.977 --> 39:48.312
You look tired.

39:53.217 --> 39:54.285
I am tired.

42:09.086 --> 42:10.154
What a shame.

42:12.222 --> 42:13.490
What are you doing?

42:15.125 --> 42:17.361
I'm gonna bury this
innocent creature.

42:17.394 --> 42:18.729
That's someone's catch.

42:20.597 --> 42:22.132
Trapping innocent
animals to get their pelt.

42:23.200 --> 42:24.535
What kind of evil man does this?

42:28.205 --> 42:31.675
Feel like animals deserve
funerals more than humans.

42:38.315 --> 42:40.551
Cal, we don't even
have a pick or a shovel.

42:40.584 --> 42:42.386
And don't you think
we should be going?

42:42.419 --> 42:43.587
Heading North.

42:43.620 --> 42:45.222
We're not going North.

42:45.255 --> 42:46.123
Why not?

42:47.624 --> 42:49.226
We got things to attend to.

42:49.259 --> 42:51.128
Cal, not for nothing,

42:51.161 --> 42:53.764
you just stabbed a man to
death back in Red Bluff.

42:53.797 --> 42:55.399
Law's gonna be looking for us.

42:58.368 --> 42:59.236
You're right.

43:00.404 --> 43:01.572
We ought to be prepared.

43:04.741 --> 43:05.676
For what?

43:07.177 --> 43:08.612
To kill my father.

43:34.204 --> 43:35.072
Morning.

43:55.859 --> 43:58.128
A box of .45's.

44:05.369 --> 44:08.171
Cost you a dollar.

44:09.540 --> 44:11.708
Some youngins
came through town,

44:11.742 --> 44:13.277
just wanna know where they went.

44:17.247 --> 44:19.316
We got lots of
types come in here.

44:29.860 --> 44:32.629
I know when that group
come in, weren't no good.

44:34.798 --> 44:36.433
So these boys were no good,

44:36.466 --> 44:37.568
but you sold them
ammunition anyway.

44:40.137 --> 44:42.372
Not in my position
to do otherwise.

44:49.279 --> 44:52.149
Blood will be
on your hands sir.

44:55.852 --> 44:58.388
You don't know what's coming.

45:47.371 --> 45:49.740
Holy Christ!

48:07.778 --> 48:08.812
You alone out here?

48:18.055 --> 48:20.791
We got a camp right over yonder.

48:22.359 --> 48:23.794
You can join us for
breakfast if you want.

49:21.618 --> 49:25.555
This has always been
my favorite part of you.

49:31.528 --> 49:32.729
Tell me about your boy.

49:36.968 --> 49:38.069
Don't ask me that.

49:38.102 --> 49:39.669
That's not why you're here.

49:40.938 --> 49:41.805
It is.

49:43.941 --> 49:44.841
It's part of it.

49:46.676 --> 49:48.079
I never asked you for what
I know you couldn't give.

49:52.482 --> 49:53.150
He

49:55.585 --> 49:57.989
killed folks.

49:58.022 --> 49:58.889
And I born him.

50:02.592 --> 50:04.061
Where'd he go, Anna?

50:15.239 --> 50:16.439
Let him go.

50:16.473 --> 50:17.108
Just please, please.

50:19.743 --> 50:20.610
Let him go.

50:32.889 --> 50:34.424
Solomon!

50:38.029 --> 50:40.597
Gideon, the man I was
telling you about.

50:40.630 --> 50:42.066
We're looking for a man

50:42.099 --> 50:43.600
who's been wandering
around these parts.

50:43.633 --> 50:45.069
He's killing his own kin.

50:46.971 --> 50:49.439
We're getting rumors out
of Kansas and Nebraska

50:50.807 --> 50:52.209
that he killed six
young men last year.

50:53.543 --> 50:55.779
They were all sired by whores.

50:57.514 --> 50:59.649
I never heard such a thing.

50:59.683 --> 51:02.153
We need a tracker
who knows these parts.

51:02.186 --> 51:03.486
I hear you're that man.

51:05.822 --> 51:07.657
I got problems of my own.

51:08.926 --> 51:10.127
Pay you a dollar a day.

51:12.029 --> 51:13.898
Don't
care about the money.

51:15.166 --> 51:16.499
Then do it for Jesus.

51:20.670 --> 51:22.839
I care about Him even less.

51:54.171 --> 51:56.107
A penny buys you two.

52:02.146 --> 52:03.713
I like your locket there.

52:08.818 --> 52:10.287
Who you got inside?

52:11.355 --> 52:12.223
Inside?

52:13.890 --> 52:15.226
A picture of your parents?

52:17.228 --> 52:18.528
Or a sweetheart?

52:22.866 --> 52:23.733
Nobody.

53:43.447 --> 53:44.781
He was a good friend.

53:48.319 --> 53:49.786
Yeah, he knew the danger.

53:54.691 --> 53:55.859
My hand is killing me.

54:09.106 --> 54:11.408
Yeah, you best get that
bandaged professionally.

54:13.010 --> 54:14.677
In the war, most men
died from infection.

54:16.480 --> 54:18.249
Smart place to go
would be Dillon.

54:30.027 --> 54:30.895
Hey Patty,

54:36.133 --> 54:38.068
you think God loves us?

55:26.951 --> 55:29.086
I need you to fix my hand.

55:30.988 --> 55:32.156
Well, take a cot.

55:32.189 --> 55:33.324
I've got mining to do.

56:01.185 --> 56:04.787
Would you mind putting
a muzzle on that?

56:07.324 --> 56:08.425
What ails you?

56:11.428 --> 56:12.896
My hand.

56:16.066 --> 56:21.038
Myself, I've just returned
from Brazil, godforsaken land.

56:22.539 --> 56:24.874
It's left me with a condition
I'm unable to shake.

56:27.278 --> 56:29.980
The Brazilians are
a disgusting people.

56:33.883 --> 56:34.851
Well, if you don't
like Brazil so much,

56:34.884 --> 56:36.553
why'd you go to Brazil?

56:36.587 --> 56:37.454
The work.

56:39.056 --> 56:40.557
Arab slave traders pay
a mighty penny still.

56:44.328 --> 56:47.231
This land has lost its
taste for violence.

56:47.264 --> 56:48.999
Lost the taste for conquest.

56:50.934 --> 56:52.102
I sought it elsewhere,

56:53.537 --> 56:55.539
the climate and
people, didn't suit me.

56:59.343 --> 57:01.045
Would you like to see something?

57:04.281 --> 57:05.149
Yeah.

57:06.216 --> 57:07.850
My father gave this to me.

57:12.556 --> 57:15.259
Not sure how long I've
had it now, but...

57:15.292 --> 57:19.129
They didn't teach you to
look at people when you talk?

57:21.498 --> 57:22.865
I am looking at you.

57:26.503 --> 57:27.471
Is that an Indian head?

57:27.504 --> 57:29.872
Not just any Indian.

57:29.907 --> 57:31.275
It's Gomez.

57:31.308 --> 57:32.842
The great Apache chief.

57:34.478 --> 57:36.347
This head was worth $2,000
before you and I were born.

57:39.183 --> 57:40.150
Son of a bitch.

57:42.353 --> 57:43.320
Grayton Willets.

57:43.354 --> 57:44.455
Of the Willets clan.

59:25.322 --> 59:28.125
Those three marks on
your chin, they come off?

59:30.527 --> 59:31.395
Nope.

59:36.600 --> 59:39.203
Buck told me
you were taken as a child.

59:42.306 --> 59:43.173
Found.

59:45.075 --> 59:46.343
A better word is found.

59:49.746 --> 59:53.350
They raised me when
my family was killed.

59:55.552 --> 59:56.687
I cannot imagine.

59:59.823 --> 01:00:01.692
You read of the
Scripture, Solomon?

01:00:03.527 --> 01:00:04.394
No.

01:00:06.497 --> 01:00:11.502
The Bible says, "Satan goes
to and fro across the Earth

01:00:14.071 --> 01:00:18.442
like a roaring lion, searching
for someone to devour."

01:00:22.646 --> 01:00:26.083
This man that we're chasing,

01:00:28.151 --> 01:00:29.253
I'm beginning to think

01:00:32.222 --> 01:00:34.157
we might be chasing
the devil himself.

01:00:37.528 --> 01:00:38.795
He's just a man.

01:00:41.298 --> 01:00:42.533
Like the rest of us.

01:00:47.538 --> 01:00:48.805
You don't believe in God?

01:00:55.746 --> 01:00:57.047
What do you believe in?

01:01:05.222 --> 01:01:07.457
I believe we'll catch
a murderer tomorrow.

01:05:57.547 --> 01:05:59.850
Must
admit your proposal

01:05:59.883 --> 01:06:02.586
is one of the more
grotesque I've come across.

01:06:02.619 --> 01:06:04.088
Helping killing your own father.

01:06:05.923 --> 01:06:07.591
Well, he's supposed
to be one of the worst killers

01:06:07.624 --> 01:06:08.758
this land's ever known.

01:06:10.627 --> 01:06:13.064
A little secret
about legendary gunfighters,

01:06:13.097 --> 01:06:16.000
they tend to die like the rest
of us when shot in the head.

01:06:19.036 --> 01:06:22.039
Tell me about this gun
you got your hands on.

01:06:23.174 --> 01:06:24.441
Army issue.

01:06:24.474 --> 01:06:25.709
.45 caliber.

01:06:25.742 --> 01:06:27.044
- 200 rounds a minute.
- Whoa!

01:06:27.078 --> 01:06:29.379
What the fuck is that?

01:06:45.795 --> 01:06:47.831
What are you doing?

01:06:47.864 --> 01:06:49.901
Well, helping a man out.

01:06:51.202 --> 01:06:52.836
Man's got no horse,

01:06:52.869 --> 01:06:53.703
gonna die out here
when the sun sets.

01:06:53.737 --> 01:06:55.438
Ashes to ashes.

01:06:55.472 --> 01:06:57.674
Banged up pretty
bad, aren't you?

01:06:57.707 --> 01:06:58.842
What happened?

01:07:13.790 --> 01:07:14.824
What?

01:07:14.858 --> 01:07:15.927
Get my gun.

01:07:18.862 --> 01:07:20.965
He wants me to get his gun.

01:07:20.998 --> 01:07:24.634
Take me with you.

01:07:24.668 --> 01:07:25.937
Can't do that.

01:07:27.271 --> 01:07:30.074
You got any money on you?

01:07:34.878 --> 01:07:38.149
I'll tell you something
that you wanna know.

01:07:38.182 --> 01:07:41.718
And what the fuck
would I want to know?

01:07:42.752 --> 01:07:43.820
Pray tell me.

01:07:52.229 --> 01:07:53.097
Go on.

01:07:54.664 --> 01:07:56.067
You ain't the one.

01:08:03.140 --> 01:08:03.975
Die.

01:08:48.585 --> 01:08:50.087
You're surrounded
by armed men.

01:08:56.327 --> 01:08:57.861
Don't move or I'll shoot you.

01:09:31.162 --> 01:09:32.629
Easy.

01:09:35.332 --> 01:09:36.267
Cheyenne?

01:09:37.734 --> 01:09:39.803
Yeah, you could say that.

01:09:41.205 --> 01:09:42.705
Only ones
I could never hear.

01:09:56.686 --> 01:10:00.590
If it was me,
we'd burn you alive.

01:10:02.359 --> 01:10:03.928
I know what you really are.

01:10:06.997 --> 01:10:08.731
You may not be
the devil himself,

01:10:08.765 --> 01:10:10.867
but I know you are
familiar with his ways.

01:10:10.901 --> 01:10:12.002
Easy Gideon.

01:10:12.036 --> 01:10:13.636
Solomon, he's got a right

01:10:13.670 --> 01:10:14.771
to give the beast a
piece of his mind.

01:10:14.804 --> 01:10:16.806
Yeah, I'd give him one piece.

01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:17.707
Hey.

01:10:20.177 --> 01:10:23.314
You'd kill
me to protect him?

01:10:25.382 --> 01:10:26.250
Hand it over.

01:10:35.326 --> 01:10:37.094
You don't see
what he really is.

01:10:40.763 --> 01:10:43.067
What are you gonna do
when the Rapture comes?

01:10:45.402 --> 01:10:47.371
Come let's go, come, get.

01:11:02.719 --> 01:11:04.455
What do you think?

01:11:04.488 --> 01:11:07.358
I think it's the most
magnificent thing I've ever seen.

01:11:09.927 --> 01:11:11.462
We best get a move on.

01:11:11.495 --> 01:11:13.663
All those guns could
belong to some law.

01:11:17.301 --> 01:11:18.402
You got some
men we can call on

01:11:18.435 --> 01:11:19.836
to help assist with this task?

01:11:21.238 --> 01:11:22.306
I believe I do.

01:11:50.867 --> 01:11:53.170
Gather round, ye men
of the Willets clan!

01:11:54.338 --> 01:11:55.973
What you got there, brother?

01:11:56.006 --> 01:11:56.907
New friend.

01:11:58.275 --> 01:11:59.176
And a new toy.

01:12:10.421 --> 01:12:12.022
Where, pray tell did you find

01:12:12.056 --> 01:12:13.290
this immaculate
piece of weaponry?

01:12:14.391 --> 01:12:15.993
I didn't find it.

01:12:16.026 --> 01:12:16.893
I took it.

01:12:18.229 --> 01:12:19.862
Killed a lot of men
to get this gun.

01:12:23.367 --> 01:12:24.867
What say we have a drink?

01:13:00.537 --> 01:13:01.838
You trust this clan?

01:13:09.179 --> 01:13:10.981
I don't gotta trust them.

01:13:11.015 --> 01:13:13.250
I just need a few men to
help me kill my father.

01:13:15.852 --> 01:13:17.854
Because he cut your
mama's finger off?

01:13:24.861 --> 01:13:26.829
I can understand
if you're scared.

01:13:26.863 --> 01:13:28.465
Want to get out of
here, cut loose.

01:13:29.933 --> 01:13:31.101
This ain't your problem.

01:13:34.938 --> 01:13:36.040
And go where?

01:13:38.008 --> 01:13:38.875
Do what?

01:14:16.947 --> 01:14:20.217
You really
do what they say?

01:14:23.053 --> 01:14:24.321
What do they say?

01:14:27.558 --> 01:14:28.625
Kill your children?

01:14:32.696 --> 01:14:34.098
Their blood was cursed.

01:14:38.469 --> 01:14:41.305
Not even the Cheyenne
believe these things anymore.

01:14:51.982 --> 01:14:53.283
All my life,

01:14:55.219 --> 01:14:56.653
people been scared of me.

01:15:01.725 --> 01:15:03.026
Disgusted by me,

01:15:06.397 --> 01:15:10.234
but nobody ever asked
me what it means.

01:15:12.569 --> 01:15:14.338
It means safe passage.

01:15:20.043 --> 01:15:22.379
To the afterlife.

01:16:22.406 --> 01:16:24.141
I believe you
and I have found ourself

01:16:24.174 --> 01:16:26.510
in a situation of
mutual interest.

01:16:28.245 --> 01:16:29.379
You know where my father is?

01:16:29.413 --> 01:16:31.014
Yes, I do.

01:16:31.048 --> 01:16:32.249
And I know something
better than that.

01:16:32.282 --> 01:16:33.517
I know where's he going.

01:16:34.785 --> 01:16:36.587
You gotta make me a promise.

01:16:38.155 --> 01:16:40.457
What's that?

01:16:40.491 --> 01:16:41.758
Kill him good.

01:17:45.122 --> 01:17:45.789
When you going?

01:17:45.822 --> 01:17:47.691
Tomorrow.

01:17:47.724 --> 01:17:49.493
Oh. Thought you'd
last longer than a week.

01:17:49.526 --> 01:17:52.362
Just needed some
scratch to get on through.

01:17:52.396 --> 01:17:53.263
You wanna come?

01:17:58.502 --> 01:18:00.771
Your boy killed more men.

01:18:00.804 --> 01:18:02.372
He did not.

01:18:02.406 --> 01:18:03.240
I told you he left.

01:18:03.273 --> 01:18:04.675
Where?

01:18:04.708 --> 01:18:06.343
You're aiding and
abetting a criminal.

01:18:06.376 --> 01:18:07.711
What did you say?

01:18:07.744 --> 01:18:09.613
Aiding a boy I brought
into this world.

01:18:09.646 --> 01:18:11.448
A boy I love so much.

01:18:11.481 --> 01:18:14.251
A boy I couldn't do
anything for, let him go,

01:18:14.284 --> 01:18:17.087
when all I wanted to do was
to take care of him myself.

01:18:25.162 --> 01:18:26.597
No, no, don't.

01:18:27.664 --> 01:18:28.765
What are you doing with him?

01:18:28.799 --> 01:18:30.667
Please don't do this, please.

01:18:30.701 --> 01:18:32.536
Just, just calm down.

01:18:41.178 --> 01:18:42.412
Thanks, soldier.

01:18:51.221 --> 01:18:55.859
What have you done!

01:19:20.250 --> 01:19:22.920
Hey!

01:19:22.954 --> 01:19:23.820
Hey!

01:19:40.905 --> 01:19:42.205
Now pack your things.

01:19:42.239 --> 01:19:43.273
Come on, let's get a move on.

01:19:43.306 --> 01:19:44.408
I can't do this.

01:19:47.477 --> 01:19:48.512
I did this for you.

01:19:49.479 --> 01:19:50.580
You're just like him.

01:19:51.515 --> 01:19:52.349
You're the devil.

01:19:56.319 --> 01:19:57.621
You killed the man...

01:19:59.856 --> 01:20:00.724
Huh?

01:20:02.994 --> 01:20:04.394
Killed the man that what?

01:20:06.998 --> 01:20:08.298
Killed the man that what?

01:20:08.331 --> 01:20:09.666
You killed the man I loved.

01:20:11.401 --> 01:20:12.536
I can't go with you.

01:20:15.907 --> 01:20:18.308
What the hell are
you gonna do here?

01:20:18.341 --> 01:20:19.476
Same as I've always done.

01:20:19.509 --> 01:20:20.377
I'm a whore.

01:20:23.714 --> 01:20:25.582
You are not a whore.

01:20:49.506 --> 01:20:50.975
You're not a whore.

01:21:01.052 --> 01:21:02.285
We're going up North.

01:21:03.386 --> 01:21:04.254
Together.

01:21:13.396 --> 01:21:16.000
What's going on here?

01:21:19.402 --> 01:21:20.604
He's in town.

01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:05.555
I heard you were a legend.

01:26:07.857 --> 01:26:12.862
My family makes their
name killing legends.

01:26:14.231 --> 01:26:16.766
Make a nice head
for my collection.

01:29:57.921 --> 01:30:00.057
You could have loved me.

01:31:03.287 --> 01:31:04.555
Hello, father.

01:31:45.529 --> 01:31:46.463
Let's ride.

01:31:54.705 --> 01:31:57.908
She did not wait
to verify that he was dead.

01:31:58.976 --> 01:32:02.546
Or rather she moved on alone.

01:32:02.579 --> 01:32:04.348
For years.

01:32:04.381 --> 01:32:06.650
Until eventually settling
into a quiet life

01:32:06.683 --> 01:32:08.419
in Carson City, Nevada.

01:32:09.753 --> 01:32:12.456
She married and
bore three children

01:32:12.489 --> 01:32:14.458
who had no knowledge
of their ancestor.

01:32:15.726 --> 01:32:17.361
Two oldest were girls.

01:32:18.495 --> 01:32:19.563
The last child,
