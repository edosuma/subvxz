WEBVTT

00:08.142 --> 00:09.610
-Beth's in the house!
-Oh, my God!

00:09.710 --> 00:11.945
We're old and fabulous.

00:12.046 --> 00:14.082
And hopefully more mature.

00:14.182 --> 00:16.384
Guess who's back, bitches!

00:16.484 --> 00:18.786
I have a very forgiving heart,
but I'm owed an apology.

00:18.886 --> 00:20.421
Give me hugs!

00:20.521 --> 00:22.523
I don't think we'll be
doing a lot of arguing.

00:23.091 --> 00:24.158
Will we?

00:25.626 --> 00:27.295
I mean, I know I've,
like, reached out to you

00:27.395 --> 00:28.596
-on social media...
-You have? Girl, when?

00:28.696 --> 00:30.364
...and you didn't even respond.

00:30.464 --> 00:31.632
I don't think
it was important to her

00:31.732 --> 00:34.735
to have a relationship with me.

00:34.835 --> 00:36.337
Favorite moment, David?

00:36.437 --> 00:38.539
It all went by so fast for me,

00:38.639 --> 00:41.142
then all of a sudden,
it was over.

00:41.242 --> 00:42.443
Yeah.

00:42.543 --> 00:44.011
I think that everybody
was very aware

00:44.112 --> 00:48.182
that David suffered once
he got ousted from the house.

00:48.282 --> 00:50.318
But he wasn't the only one.

00:50.418 --> 00:53.421
Uh-oh. Incoming message!

00:54.522 --> 00:57.291
Don't do that! I swear to God!

00:57.391 --> 01:00.361
-No! No!

01:00.461 --> 01:03.564
You can't understand
the magnitude of why I was like,

01:03.664 --> 01:05.299
"Don't pull these damn covers
off of me."

01:05.399 --> 01:09.737
Y'all did not see me
popping laxatives.

01:09.837 --> 01:12.873
Y'all did not hear me
throwing up.

01:13.507 --> 01:17.478
I'm willing now to give you
a pass on that.

01:17.578 --> 01:19.513
But I don't want it,
and this is why.

01:19.913 --> 01:23.851
Everybody's laughing,
including you.

01:23.951 --> 01:27.555
Right now, I'm being honest,
I was dealing with some shit!

01:27.655 --> 01:29.457
-Okay! I had no idea!
-Okay, so you...

01:29.557 --> 01:32.360
So you sitting here laughing,
it's not funny!

01:32.460 --> 01:33.994
It's still not funny.

01:40.734 --> 01:42.069
This is the true story...

01:43.571 --> 01:44.972
Of seven strangers...

01:45.072 --> 01:47.541
Picked to move
back into a house...

01:47.641 --> 01:49.310
And have
their lives taped again.

01:49.410 --> 01:50.311
Guess who's back.

01:50.411 --> 01:51.579
Find out what happens...

01:51.679 --> 01:52.880
When people stop being polite...

01:52.980 --> 01:54.248
And start getting real.

01:54.348 --> 01:55.649
Westside!

02:09.630 --> 02:11.399
I'm sorry.

02:11.499 --> 02:13.934
-I wasn't here,
but I'm still sorry.
-I appreciate that.

02:14.034 --> 02:16.170
Talking about the blanket
is very uncomfortable for me

02:16.270 --> 02:18.606
because I wasn't there,
but I'm a viewer.

02:18.706 --> 02:21.108
Every bit of what David did
was disrespectful.

02:21.209 --> 02:23.377
That's shit
I'm still dealing with,

02:23.477 --> 02:25.246
and I'm trying to heal.

02:25.346 --> 02:26.547
I know.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.816
That's shit
I'm still dealing with.

02:30.418 --> 02:32.820
Shit has happened to me,
and when I'm opening up...

02:32.920 --> 02:34.522
That's why I don't open up
to people.

02:34.622 --> 02:36.657
'Cause nobody gives a fuck,
anyway!

02:36.757 --> 02:38.025
No, I care.

02:38.125 --> 02:39.393
So, what the fuck
did you say it for?

02:39.493 --> 02:40.794
Nobody cares.

02:40.894 --> 02:42.363
When you wired your mouth shut,

02:42.463 --> 02:44.498
I said to you, "Why can't you
just be who you are?"

02:44.598 --> 02:47.601
-I didn't know how.
-Yeah.

02:48.402 --> 02:49.970
-I had a false image.
-I was trying to tell you.

02:50.070 --> 02:51.805
-I was trying to tell you--
-That you...

02:51.905 --> 02:54.508
That you were understanding
of what I was going through.

02:54.608 --> 02:56.877
I loved you the way
you were. I mean.

02:56.977 --> 02:58.379
I didn't.

02:58.479 --> 03:01.315
It was a trigger for me
seeing her go through that.

03:01.415 --> 03:02.850
I've been through a lot
of things in life.

03:02.950 --> 03:04.585
I've let people walk away

03:04.685 --> 03:06.220
and I just figured
they needed time.

03:06.320 --> 03:08.956
But from my experience
in that situation,

03:09.056 --> 03:10.558
I felt like I had to go
over there

03:10.658 --> 03:12.059
and even if I didn't say
anything to her,

03:12.159 --> 03:14.662
she needed to know
that I was there for her.

03:16.264 --> 03:17.731
She just said
the most vulnerable thing

03:17.831 --> 03:19.099
I've heard her say in her life,

03:19.199 --> 03:21.402
and that does not mitigate
for one moment

03:21.502 --> 03:22.903
what you experienced.

03:23.003 --> 03:25.906
But as someone who watched
her wire her jaw shut,

03:26.006 --> 03:28.008
as a young, beautiful,
Black woman,

03:28.108 --> 03:30.010
the moment
she just had right here,

03:30.110 --> 03:31.645
we don't want to miss that
'cause we've been nervous

03:31.745 --> 03:33.881
about having this conversation.

03:33.981 --> 03:36.016
Because she just showed
a vulnerability

03:36.116 --> 03:37.685
that I didn't think she had.

03:37.785 --> 03:40.254
In that moment,
I felt like she wasn't heard.

03:40.354 --> 03:43.424
I felt that people weren't
concerned about their part

03:43.524 --> 03:46.226
that they played in it,
and that it overstepped

03:46.327 --> 03:50.964
hearing what she really
is sharing with us right now.

03:51.064 --> 03:53.867
Tami, I don't want
to lose the moment.

03:53.967 --> 03:55.536
I just want to make sure
we don't miss that,

03:55.636 --> 03:59.172
that in the heat of that,
that it's not acknowledged.

03:59.273 --> 04:02.510
Let's just move on 'cause
what I feel I just disclosed

04:02.610 --> 04:04.044
was important to me.

04:04.144 --> 04:06.347
-Hugely.
-And that was laughed at.

04:06.447 --> 04:08.982
My shit was comical.

04:09.082 --> 04:11.752
I had no idea that even ever
happened in the house.

04:12.886 --> 04:14.622
What this moment was

04:14.722 --> 04:16.457
was someone thinking
they were funny

04:16.557 --> 04:20.428
because they were a comedian
and not understanding

04:20.528 --> 04:24.031
the person that
they were doing this act with

04:24.131 --> 04:28.669
was battling something
and did not view it as funny.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.742
I get where you coming
from, Tami.

04:35.208 --> 04:36.410
And I just kind of want you
to understand

04:36.510 --> 04:38.011
where I'm coming from.

04:38.111 --> 04:40.714
It was hard for me to judge
when everybody's around me

04:40.814 --> 04:42.616
laughing and banging
on the floor.

04:42.716 --> 04:46.320
I honestly thought we were all
having a good fucking time.

04:46.420 --> 04:48.055
I am so sorry.

04:48.155 --> 04:49.357
I wasn't laughing at that scene

04:49.457 --> 04:51.224
but I'm laughing
at everybody's laughing

04:51.325 --> 04:52.993
and it's just
such a bizarre thing

04:53.093 --> 04:54.362
that it is what it is

04:54.462 --> 04:56.930
and I apologize
for my actions in that.

04:57.030 --> 04:58.799
Like I've done a million times.

04:58.899 --> 05:02.035
And, David,
what I'm saying to you...

05:02.135 --> 05:08.609
was an apology
for that incident...

05:08.709 --> 05:10.878
is not necessarily...

05:12.212 --> 05:14.615
what needed to happen
for me specifically

05:14.715 --> 05:15.816
about that moment.

05:15.916 --> 05:18.151
Because I've come to a place

05:18.251 --> 05:22.122
where I feel like
we were all young.

05:22.956 --> 05:25.726
It was something that happened,

05:25.826 --> 05:29.930
and we both
had different perspectives

05:30.030 --> 05:33.401
of the exact same situation.

05:33.501 --> 05:35.536
What hurt me today,

05:35.636 --> 05:40.908
when I explained to you
why that moment in '93

05:41.008 --> 05:44.077
got the reaction that it did...

05:45.446 --> 05:46.680
instead of you,

05:46.780 --> 05:50.951
if your apology is genuine,
right?

05:51.051 --> 05:53.286
Instead of you saying,
"Damn, T,

05:53.387 --> 05:55.423
I didn't know you
was dealing with that.

05:55.523 --> 05:58.559
Now I really am fucking sorry
for how that happened

05:58.659 --> 06:00.694
and what, you know, I get it."

06:00.794 --> 06:04.097
You chose to still laugh

06:04.197 --> 06:06.366
at me disclosing to you

06:06.467 --> 06:09.369
what I was really dealing with
in my real life.

06:09.470 --> 06:11.004
I said before I laughed

06:11.104 --> 06:12.940
that I had no idea
what you was dealing with.

06:13.040 --> 06:17.411
No, I'm talking about
we had a chain of events.

06:17.511 --> 06:21.181
I say what's going on,
you say, "Roll the clip again."

06:21.281 --> 06:23.684
It plays, you start laughing.

06:23.784 --> 06:25.753
I get annoyed that
you're laughing.

06:25.853 --> 06:30.323
We blow up. I go over there
and now you're apologizing.

06:31.091 --> 06:32.660
The chain of events
should have been,

06:32.760 --> 06:34.528
when I disclosed to you...

06:35.496 --> 06:39.700
some real shit
that's going on in my life...

06:39.800 --> 06:42.402
or that was going on
at the time...

06:43.103 --> 06:45.739
that's where the apology
should have been.

06:45.839 --> 06:47.374
I apologized to Tami.

06:47.475 --> 06:50.844
Some people out there don't
want me apologizing at all,

06:50.944 --> 06:53.747
but the audience didn't know
as well as me,

06:53.847 --> 06:56.517
that she had body dysmorphia.

06:57.217 --> 07:02.422
And if I knew that, no way
that would have went down.

07:02.956 --> 07:05.325
I just wished I would
have known.

07:05.425 --> 07:06.827
You know what?

07:06.927 --> 07:09.563
I'm gonna be responsible
and accountable for my actions.

07:10.297 --> 07:12.199
To some people it was funny...

07:13.133 --> 07:17.905
and... and... and, apparently,
at a moment in time,

07:18.371 --> 07:21.575
it was not no longer funny
to you.

07:22.242 --> 07:26.547
And I apologize
for taking a joke too far.

07:26.647 --> 07:28.516
Yeah, you were pulling
the blanket first,

07:28.616 --> 07:29.717
and y'all were in the room,

07:29.817 --> 07:32.820
but I'm the one
that finished it.

07:32.920 --> 07:34.522
And I deserve holding the bag

07:34.622 --> 07:38.626
and I accept responsibility
for what I did and I apologize.

07:38.726 --> 07:41.194
I had no idea
and if I'd have known that,

07:41.294 --> 07:43.130
none of that would
have went down.

07:43.731 --> 07:45.332
I would like to think

07:45.432 --> 07:49.036
that with David and myself
having this conversation,

07:49.136 --> 07:50.904
reliving that clip,

07:51.004 --> 07:53.507
talking about it
as best we could,

07:53.607 --> 07:56.209
that the moment is passed.

07:57.177 --> 07:59.046
Incoming message.

07:59.146 --> 08:01.181
-Oh, wow.

08:01.281 --> 08:04.484
This incoming message
comes on the screen

08:04.585 --> 08:09.757
and it's a mixture of anxiety
and impending doom.

08:09.857 --> 08:11.491
I can't even believe
that you think

08:11.592 --> 08:13.794
that what you did to her
is nothing!

08:13.894 --> 08:16.429
It just escalated. You know,
one thing led to another.

08:16.530 --> 08:17.831
It seemed like Beth
kept instigating it.

08:17.931 --> 08:19.466
It was like a hot-air balloon.

08:19.567 --> 08:21.368
She kept putting more
hot air into the balloon.

08:21.468 --> 08:23.236
Making Tami
more madder and madder.

08:23.336 --> 08:25.272
You guys were laughing
and giggling when I did it.

08:25.372 --> 08:28.942
-No, I wasn't!
-I was telling you
to leave me the hell alone!

08:29.042 --> 08:30.377
It was not funny, David.

08:30.477 --> 08:32.212
You guys were laughing
and giggling.

08:32.312 --> 08:34.214
You can take off your pants.
I am not like that.

08:34.314 --> 08:36.316
Okay. And you totally
disrespected me.

08:36.416 --> 08:38.586
You don't have any respect
for yourself.

08:38.686 --> 08:40.621
Here you go, hey.
Here you go, hey.

08:40.721 --> 08:42.590
Here you go.
I took off my clothes.

08:42.690 --> 08:44.357
-Don't come in here, David.
-There you go, okay?

08:44.457 --> 08:46.059
-I took off my pants.
-You're such a child.

08:46.159 --> 08:47.828
I'll call the police
and scream rape.

08:47.928 --> 08:50.030
"I'll call the police
and scream rape."

08:50.130 --> 08:51.231
Okay, so who said that?

08:51.331 --> 08:53.033
-I did.
-Okay.

08:53.133 --> 08:55.002
I should have never said that.

08:55.102 --> 08:57.671
I should have done
something else to stop him.

08:58.438 --> 08:59.640
It's ugly.

08:59.740 --> 09:04.678
It's stupid
and I'm embarrassed by it.

09:05.779 --> 09:07.748
She had on her bra
and underwear!

09:07.848 --> 09:09.316
You guys laughed when I was
doing it. I was playing.

09:09.416 --> 09:11.451
I was trying to cover her up.

09:11.551 --> 09:12.352
Oh, my God!

09:12.452 --> 09:14.554
Okay, that is not funny!

09:14.655 --> 09:16.489
Whether you...

09:16.590 --> 09:19.459
Hey, there's no violence
in our bedroom here, ladies.

09:19.559 --> 09:20.828
I don't know what
you did in there,

09:20.928 --> 09:22.362
but she's filing charges.

09:22.462 --> 09:24.197
I just pulled
the cover off of her...

09:24.297 --> 09:25.866
You did not just pull
the cover off of me.

09:25.966 --> 09:28.769
I told you to stop!
My underwears are coming down.

09:28.869 --> 09:30.137
But you're laughing
'cause it's funny.

09:30.237 --> 09:32.906
And it wasn't not funny, okay?

09:33.006 --> 09:34.107
I'll leave the house, all right?

09:34.207 --> 09:35.776
Good! Leave!

09:35.876 --> 09:38.378
We'd be very happy.
We'd feel much safer!

09:38.478 --> 09:40.280
I was really upset
that nobody else

09:40.380 --> 09:41.982
stuck up for Tami except me.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.684
And David tried to turn around

09:43.784 --> 09:45.886
and say that it was all my fault
because I'm the instigator.

09:45.986 --> 09:48.822
I'm the instigator because
nobody else stuck up for Tami

09:48.922 --> 09:50.624
and he thought that
he did nothing wrong.

09:50.724 --> 09:52.359
Sue me for pulling a cover
off of her, playing.

09:52.459 --> 09:53.861
You guys were on the floor.

09:53.961 --> 09:55.896
Oh, yeah, and that's
what a rapist says, too.

09:55.996 --> 09:57.731
"You wanted it, baby."

09:57.831 --> 09:59.166
That's two rapes.

09:59.266 --> 10:00.233
I was playing,
I was pulling a towel.

10:00.333 --> 10:01.702
You ever been at a beach?

10:01.802 --> 10:02.936
Somebody says stop,
you're playing...

10:03.036 --> 10:04.204
She's in her bra and underwear.

10:04.304 --> 10:05.605
Her bra and underwear.

10:05.706 --> 10:07.307
You can see that
in Victoria's Secret.

10:07.407 --> 10:08.742
She's crying, okay!
She's really upset.

10:08.842 --> 10:10.410
You don't understand.

10:10.510 --> 10:12.145
You were right there
on the floor laughing!

10:12.245 --> 10:13.914
You were laughing!

10:14.014 --> 10:15.783
I mean, she was overreacting,
you know what I'm saying.

10:15.883 --> 10:17.918
She says "You know,
you violated her, her privacy.

10:18.018 --> 10:20.553
It's just like rape.
You don't know when to stop."

10:20.654 --> 10:22.255
You know, this, that and...
And that freaked me out.

10:22.355 --> 10:23.857
Because women shouldn't play
with that word.

10:23.957 --> 10:26.126
They think it's just
the funniest thing

10:26.226 --> 10:27.260
that could happen.

10:27.360 --> 10:29.229
Like no meant yes, right?

10:29.329 --> 10:31.631
Yeah. I guess no meant yes.

10:33.566 --> 10:36.169
You always came after me. Why?

10:36.269 --> 10:39.539
David, let's talk
about the clip.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.008
I know, but why?

10:41.108 --> 10:43.110
'Cause you were always
in the middle of something.

10:43.210 --> 10:44.712
Let's start with that, why?

10:44.812 --> 10:48.381
I think it's important, David...

10:49.783 --> 10:52.986
for you to accept responsibility
for what happened.

10:53.086 --> 10:54.321
You can't blame me

10:54.421 --> 10:55.989
for something that you did
in that hallway.

10:56.089 --> 10:59.326
I feel like you're trying
to blame me for your actions.

10:59.426 --> 11:02.362
I didn't make you do
what you did to Tami.

11:02.462 --> 11:06.166
I didn't make Tami
react in a certain way.

11:06.266 --> 11:08.668
Like, everything
is directed toward me.

11:09.837 --> 11:12.405
Yeah, because you're the one
in the hallway.

11:12.505 --> 11:14.708
"That's what a rapist does,
baby." This, that and the other.

11:14.808 --> 11:18.345
And... and... and then I got
a police officer in the house.

11:18.445 --> 11:20.247
"I'll call the police
and scream rape."

11:20.347 --> 11:22.415
I'm like, "What the fuck?"

11:23.316 --> 11:27.420
You had no right
to classify me as a rapist.

11:27.520 --> 11:30.090
None of you did,
and that's dead fucking wrong.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.926
You know what,
fuck you for doing that!

11:33.026 --> 11:35.095
I love you and fuck you too.

11:35.195 --> 11:36.629
-Okay, fuck you too.
-Thank you.

11:48.041 --> 11:50.577
I'm here to say sorry
for what I did.

11:50.677 --> 11:52.780
In my role, in my part.

11:52.880 --> 11:55.148
Because I remember you asked me,
you were up there,

11:55.248 --> 11:57.217
"Irene, will you talk to me?"
and I said "No."

11:57.317 --> 11:59.052
Irene, can I talk to you?

11:59.586 --> 12:02.322
David, we all agreed
we wouldn't say anything.

12:02.422 --> 12:05.058
I wanted to talk to you
without the cameras.

12:05.158 --> 12:07.460
I couldn't get that. Now I want
to talk to you by yourself.

12:07.560 --> 12:08.862
I can't get that.

12:08.962 --> 12:11.264
So either way,
I look like the asshole.

12:11.799 --> 12:13.566
That's 'cause you are.

12:13.934 --> 12:16.536
-Why is that necessary?
-You are, David.

12:17.304 --> 12:19.039
I should have
never said that in the hallway.

12:19.139 --> 12:21.274
But I think
I did it out of fear.

12:22.009 --> 12:24.812
I just jumped in
'cause I was fearful

12:24.912 --> 12:28.115
of what was gonna happen
'cause of my job, my family.

12:28.215 --> 12:30.550
So shame on me
for using that word.

12:31.118 --> 12:34.454
But it was in that moment
of fear

12:34.554 --> 12:36.156
that I didn't know
what else to say

12:36.256 --> 12:38.291
to get you to stop
coming down that hallway.

12:38.859 --> 12:40.693
But I should have never used
that word

12:40.794 --> 12:42.029
and I apologize for that--

12:42.129 --> 12:43.630
Thank you,
and you're not the only one.

12:43.730 --> 12:45.198
I got two women throwing
the word rape around.

12:45.298 --> 12:46.766
Who's the two women?

12:46.867 --> 12:48.701
-Beth and Irene.
-Oh, okay.

12:48.802 --> 12:50.170
-Because I never said that.
-No.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.840
The verbiage that I used was
I was disrespected

12:52.940 --> 12:54.341
and I was humiliated.

12:54.441 --> 12:57.244
That is what I've always said
about that moment.

12:57.344 --> 13:00.580
I never classified you
as a rapist.

13:01.248 --> 13:05.118
But you coming down that hall
with your dick swinging,

13:05.218 --> 13:10.090
you have to openly admit
that if that happened today,

13:10.190 --> 13:11.925
that would be
a Me Too situation--

13:12.025 --> 13:13.894
-But it didn't happen today.
-It did not.

13:13.994 --> 13:15.295
-Thank God it happened in 1993.
-It did not! It did not!

13:15.395 --> 13:17.264
-So it's not a Me Too situation.
-It did not.

13:17.364 --> 13:19.799
So let's get the fuck up off
the Me Too situation

13:19.900 --> 13:21.902
because I'm not going back
to the rapist

13:22.002 --> 13:23.937
-and the...
-But... Okay, child.

13:24.037 --> 13:25.906
Once I had my daughter,

13:26.006 --> 13:29.809
my whole outlook of how to treat
a woman or act around women,

13:29.910 --> 13:31.644
it just changed,
it just did.

13:31.744 --> 13:33.180
I don't know how to explain it,

13:33.280 --> 13:35.448
it's just one of the best
blessings I ever had in my life.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.250
-I believe you.
-You know, so...

13:37.350 --> 13:39.052
My daughter watched it...

13:39.920 --> 13:41.021
and she got so pissed off

13:41.121 --> 13:42.956
at you guys for calling me
a rapist.

13:43.056 --> 13:44.858
Like that really hurt her.

13:44.958 --> 13:46.726
I don't think you're a bad guy.

13:46.826 --> 13:49.262
I said it was a situation
that happened

13:49.362 --> 13:51.831
that everybody had
their own percept...

13:51.932 --> 13:54.034
Beth had her own perception
of why she...

13:54.134 --> 13:55.635
Irene, she said what she said

13:55.735 --> 13:57.270
because she had her own
perception of the situation.

13:57.370 --> 13:59.306
The whole United States
of America

13:59.406 --> 14:00.573
had their own perception.

14:00.673 --> 14:02.409
Yeah, but what I'm saying is

14:02.509 --> 14:05.378
that's why we're having
this conversation

14:05.478 --> 14:08.481
so that everybody can talk
to what they were going through

14:08.581 --> 14:12.019
at the time within that moment.

14:12.119 --> 14:13.386
And when this happened

14:13.486 --> 14:15.622
and I was trying to explain
to you guys

14:15.722 --> 14:17.624
but nobody wanted to hear me.

14:17.724 --> 14:20.460
You guys wanted me out
at all costs.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.029
Nobody wanted to hear my cries,

14:22.129 --> 14:24.264
my begs, my pleas,
how sorry I was.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.299
It was just
"Get the fuck out of here."

14:26.399 --> 14:27.534
And I had to go home--

14:27.634 --> 14:28.535
Because for me,
the damage was done

14:28.635 --> 14:30.938
in terms of how I felt

14:31.038 --> 14:35.943
and how I envisioned people
looking at me being...

14:36.043 --> 14:39.980
to me in my mind, naked,
exposed.

14:40.480 --> 14:43.150
But no one is thinking about
the damage that was done to me

14:43.250 --> 14:46.319
with the false... with the word
rape and stuff thrown around.

14:46.419 --> 14:49.990
That shit, just like me pulling
that blanket,

14:50.090 --> 14:51.925
was not cool
in a mental state.

14:52.025 --> 14:54.327
That rape shit
I got labeled with,

14:54.427 --> 14:57.497
on a mental state,
was not cool either.

14:58.065 --> 14:59.732
I think I need you to understand

14:59.832 --> 15:03.403
that the reason we did not feel
comfortable living with you

15:03.503 --> 15:06.639
or why I did not feel
comfortable living with you,

15:06.739 --> 15:09.809
is because I feel like
there were a lot of incidents

15:09.909 --> 15:12.079
that happened up to that point,

15:12.179 --> 15:15.983
you didn't understand
people's boundaries.

15:16.083 --> 15:18.651
David was super aggressive.

15:19.286 --> 15:21.588
-Tell me, man. Tell me. Tell me.
-Back off.

15:21.688 --> 15:24.992
He would get very upset
about little things.

15:25.092 --> 15:26.593
Why do you keep moving my box?

15:26.693 --> 15:28.795
So I can get over here
and get my clothes.

15:28.895 --> 15:30.130
The bowling incident.

15:30.230 --> 15:31.198
I said I'm on the phone.

15:31.298 --> 15:33.233
All you guys, at the same time,

15:33.333 --> 15:35.235
got, like, this big-ass grunt
and left me in the house.

15:35.335 --> 15:37.537
I was taking care of Beth.
I said, "Wait a minute!"

15:37.637 --> 15:40.540
I said, "Wait, I'm on the
phone." That's what I said.

15:40.640 --> 15:43.176
I said... I said, "Wait."

15:43.276 --> 15:45.045
-Leave!
-I don't have to leave.

15:45.145 --> 15:47.914
You're a embarrassment,
man! .

15:48.015 --> 15:50.017
Yeah, obviously,
piece of .

15:50.117 --> 15:51.284
Midget.

15:51.384 --> 15:54.454
He attacked
my personal appearance

15:54.554 --> 15:55.888
on a number of occasions.

15:55.989 --> 15:57.657
Walk away
because you think you all that.

15:57.757 --> 15:59.959
That's why you got them big ass
hairy ass pimples on your face

16:00.060 --> 16:01.228
because you deserve them!

16:01.328 --> 16:04.297
He could not control
his emotions.

16:05.065 --> 16:09.336
And when
the blanket incident happened,

16:09.436 --> 16:11.938
and then he started
pulling down his pants.

16:12.039 --> 16:13.506
Here you go, hey!

16:14.107 --> 16:16.076
You know, I'm sorry,
yeah, I was scared.

16:16.176 --> 16:19.312
I did not feel safe.
I was afraid.

16:19.412 --> 16:23.816
I immediately felt I needed
to protect myself, guard myself.

16:23.916 --> 16:25.452
I didn't trust him

16:25.552 --> 16:28.288
and I just wanted to be away
from him.

16:28.655 --> 16:29.822
You've always came after me.

16:29.922 --> 16:32.492
David, let's focus
on the situation.

16:32.592 --> 16:33.960
I'm happy to talk to you about--

16:34.061 --> 16:35.428
You know what, if you felt so--
Hold on, hold on!

16:35.528 --> 16:37.997
If you felt so uncomfortable
living with me,

16:38.098 --> 16:39.866
why in the fuck I'm
in this house right now

16:39.966 --> 16:41.334
if you're so uncomfortable?

16:41.434 --> 16:43.403
You're back up under
the same roof with me now!

16:43.503 --> 16:46.173
Listen, I came here because
I wanted to talk to you about it

16:46.273 --> 16:48.975
and I wanted us
to all talk about it and heal

16:49.076 --> 16:51.044
and that's why I'm here.

16:56.149 --> 16:58.651
I've been kinda silent
but, listen,

16:58.751 --> 17:01.954
I think that all of us,
when we watched that,

17:02.055 --> 17:04.424
wish we could take
that whole night back.

17:04.524 --> 17:05.925
Yeah, me too.

17:07.660 --> 17:09.329
Let me say I'm embarrassed

17:09.429 --> 17:11.164
that I was the first one
to tug on your blanket,

17:11.264 --> 17:13.900
I owe you an apology,
it wasn't cool.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.236
Now I stopped
but I'm also embarrassed

17:16.336 --> 17:19.406
that I got down and did the WWE,
one-two-three count.

17:19.506 --> 17:20.907
Also not cool.

17:21.007 --> 17:23.610
And that's why he felt like,
"Oh, we'll keep going,"

17:23.710 --> 17:25.145
because y'all was egging him on

17:25.245 --> 17:28.448
and nobody was recognizing
that it was uncomfortable

17:28.548 --> 17:32.152
and the greatest form
of disrespect to me.

17:32.252 --> 17:33.953
Yeah, it was
and I owe you apology.

17:34.053 --> 17:35.622
All y'all played a part.

17:35.722 --> 17:38.691
Jon turned around
and apologized for his part

17:38.791 --> 17:40.427
and that was huge for me

17:40.527 --> 17:44.264
'cause now I'm not the only one
holding the fucking shit bag.

17:44.364 --> 17:49.502
We're all sorry, I'm sorry,
they're sorry, you're sorry.

17:49.602 --> 17:53.206
You know, what we're saying is,
can we forgive everybody

17:53.306 --> 17:55.742
'cause everybody needs
forgiveness in this incident.

17:55.842 --> 17:58.678
Yeah, yeah. He without sin
casts the first stone.

18:00.280 --> 18:02.615
I think everybody wants
to say, can we have a redo?

18:02.715 --> 18:05.585
Can we undo that crazy stupid
thing that happened

18:05.685 --> 18:08.355
and can we move on
from the situation?

18:08.455 --> 18:10.022
So, in addition
to all the roommates

18:10.123 --> 18:11.991
and all the people
that watched it on TV,

18:12.091 --> 18:14.494
there was producers
that were involved

18:14.594 --> 18:15.895
and gave you guys options

18:15.995 --> 18:19.065
and had the responsibility
of making a TV show.

18:22.869 --> 18:24.604
So do we wanna talk about

18:24.704 --> 18:26.739
what happened the other night
with Tami and Dave

18:26.839 --> 18:28.841
and the whole thing
and how that happened.

18:28.941 --> 18:33.680
I am really uncomfortable
with David's presence.

18:33.780 --> 18:36.216
There have been other times
off camera

18:36.316 --> 18:39.186
that he has like his jokes
or his...

18:39.286 --> 18:43.089
you know, feeling on you
and you know just little things.

18:43.190 --> 18:45.592
And I feel that
I asked him to stop

18:45.692 --> 18:48.261
before the situation
even got started

18:48.361 --> 18:50.563
and he thinks everything
is a joke.

18:50.930 --> 18:53.733
What he did to her, I mean,
it's bordering on criminal

18:53.833 --> 18:57.069
and it could be and I don't
wanna have to be here

18:57.170 --> 18:59.339
to wait until something else
happens.

18:59.706 --> 19:02.409
Tami, when I watched the tape,
once you went into the bathroom,

19:02.509 --> 19:04.177
it seemed to me like then

19:04.277 --> 19:05.612
it occurred to you
what had happened.

19:05.712 --> 19:07.614
No, I knew what was happening

19:07.714 --> 19:11.518
but what am I to do laying
in my bra and my underwear?

19:11.618 --> 19:14.086
You know, what can you do?
I just laid there.

19:14.187 --> 19:15.655
Mm-hmm.

19:15.755 --> 19:17.624
He's really gonna pay
for what he did,

19:17.724 --> 19:20.393
and I really don't think that
the producers of this show

19:20.493 --> 19:22.161
are gonna let him
get away with that.

19:22.262 --> 19:24.197
It's imperative to us,

19:24.297 --> 19:27.099
because we put you here,
that you guys feel safe.

19:27.200 --> 19:29.436
I think the
important distinction to make

19:29.536 --> 19:32.705
is we wouldn't remove anyone
from the house

19:32.805 --> 19:34.207
just because
you didn't like them.

19:34.307 --> 19:36.175
I didn't like him before,

19:36.276 --> 19:40.347
but I feel that this was like
the end.

19:40.447 --> 19:43.816
What he did to Tami
was a major violation

19:43.916 --> 19:45.452
and should not be tolerated,

19:45.552 --> 19:49.322
and Irene and I are afraid
of what he's gonna do.

19:49.422 --> 19:51.758
What else is he going to do
to us?

19:51.858 --> 19:54.294
Are we gonna be able
to sleep here at night?

19:54.394 --> 19:56.729
As long as that distinction
is clear in your minds,

19:56.829 --> 19:58.365
it's not because
you don't like him,

19:58.465 --> 20:00.066
it's not because you don't think
it's funny,

20:00.166 --> 20:03.503
it's because you feel physically
endangered having him here.

20:03.603 --> 20:06.839
I mean, my heart was
pumping with fear that night.

20:06.939 --> 20:09.842
Last time I felt that way
is when I got burglarized,

20:09.942 --> 20:12.645
and that night
I slept with my gun near me.

20:13.613 --> 20:16.816
If you still,
at the end after seeing him,

20:16.916 --> 20:18.351
if you do not feel comfortable,

20:18.451 --> 20:20.787
then we have no choice
but to ask him to leave.

20:23.222 --> 20:25.091
I feel like I'm watching
my own crucifixion.

20:25.191 --> 20:27.694
Yeah, I feel you,
I feel you there.

20:27.794 --> 20:29.061
I don't think
it was the right decision

20:29.161 --> 20:30.196
to ask him to leave.

20:30.297 --> 20:32.031
Even though I was
very, very vocal

20:32.131 --> 20:33.800
on asking him to leave,

20:33.900 --> 20:36.603
looking back now,
we should've talked

20:36.703 --> 20:40.440
and he asked me to talk
and I said no.

20:41.841 --> 20:45.111
I want you to like know
that it wasn't just us

20:45.211 --> 20:47.314
and it wasn't
just this situation

20:47.414 --> 20:50.683
and there were other people
involved in this moment.

20:52.685 --> 20:55.254
Now that the girls say that
they don't feel safe,

20:55.355 --> 20:57.990
we as a production
have to make a decision

20:58.090 --> 20:59.459
and it's not an easy one,

20:59.559 --> 21:01.127
and we understand
the sensitivity overall.

21:01.227 --> 21:06.399
They feel unsafe based upon him
doing that in that night.

21:06.499 --> 21:07.800
-No.
-No.

21:07.900 --> 21:09.669
Not just that event,
accumulative.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.237
I mean, we were surprised

21:11.338 --> 21:14.173
at the adamancy of their fear.

21:14.273 --> 21:16.543
The way this is gonna come off,
you know,

21:16.643 --> 21:19.412
I'm just really concerned about
how my client's gonna look.

21:19.512 --> 21:20.980
Sure. I think there will be
people who look at this

21:21.080 --> 21:23.416
and have the exact same thing
you're saying,

21:23.516 --> 21:25.485
that their fear is unjustified.

21:25.585 --> 21:27.554
But other people
may have other opinions.

21:29.589 --> 21:31.023
You guys can buy me
a hotel or something

21:31.123 --> 21:32.058
until I can get my stuff
together

21:32.158 --> 21:33.660
and go find me up there.

21:33.760 --> 21:35.261
I'm not a piece of shit here,
okay.

21:35.362 --> 21:36.596
-We're not... Dave...
-No, no, no, no.

21:36.696 --> 21:38.097
Don't write me a... check

21:38.197 --> 21:39.031
and you go about your merry way.
Fuck...

21:39.131 --> 21:40.567
No, no.

21:40.667 --> 21:42.268
We are definitely gonna
help you find a place.

21:42.369 --> 21:43.570
We're not putting you out
on the street.

21:44.604 --> 21:46.038
He's gonna have
to recover from this,

21:46.138 --> 21:48.641
so, you know,
it doesn't ruin his career.

21:48.741 --> 21:50.176
I'm not a piece of shit, man,

21:50.276 --> 21:51.578
I'm a human being
up in here, man.

21:52.545 --> 21:54.046
Although we can't have you
living in the house,

21:54.146 --> 21:56.248
we'd like to shoot you
for a couple of weeks.

21:56.349 --> 21:57.717
And one of the reasons

21:57.817 --> 21:59.552
we talked about continuing
to shoot...

21:59.652 --> 22:01.921
-I don't want to...
-Show the audience...

22:23.610 --> 22:26.145
I remember that shit
like it was yesterday.

22:29.482 --> 22:32.585
Them tears came out
because I was scared as shit.

22:35.187 --> 22:37.524
David being kicked out
of the house,

22:37.624 --> 22:40.527
the ramifications really
affected his career.

22:40.627 --> 22:44.564
That hurt to see the pain
that David had.

22:44.664 --> 22:46.833
I'd never seen him that way.

22:58.411 --> 23:01.080
I'm still scared for that
young man right now.

23:03.450 --> 23:06.786
I think that it was a very
extreme for her to bring up

23:06.886 --> 23:09.221
you know, rape
'cause there was nothing alike.

23:09.321 --> 23:13.192
But I think Beth found out that
that bothered David...

23:13.660 --> 23:14.927
that she called him a rapist

23:15.027 --> 23:17.363
and then Beth was doing it
outta spite.

23:20.533 --> 23:22.469
When I left that office,

23:22.569 --> 23:24.704
I went crashing auditions

23:24.804 --> 23:26.372
and booked everything
that I could

23:26.473 --> 23:28.074
because I knew
when this shit dropped,

23:28.174 --> 23:30.342
my whole world
was gonna change.

23:31.343 --> 23:33.045
And it did.

23:34.481 --> 23:36.082
Back in 1993,

23:36.182 --> 23:39.952
I felt like these people really
didn't give a fuck about me.

23:40.052 --> 23:41.921
They could care less
about my career

23:42.021 --> 23:45.157
or how I would handle
the false accusations

23:45.257 --> 23:47.126
of the word rape, you know.

23:47.226 --> 23:50.697
They didn't think
about it at all.

23:51.397 --> 23:52.899
When I threw those keys
on the table

23:52.999 --> 23:54.734
and left that house...

23:55.502 --> 23:57.837
it was a very scary time for me.

24:08.114 --> 24:10.016
I came to LA in '93,

24:10.116 --> 24:11.584
opportunity, lights,
camera, action,

24:11.684 --> 24:13.119
show business, Hollywood.

24:13.219 --> 24:15.922
I was doing stand-up.
I had BET specials.

24:16.022 --> 24:17.389
Yo, these people, like
Freddy Krueger and Jason,

24:17.490 --> 24:19.191
they won't take no
for an answer, right?

24:19.291 --> 24:21.027
You know, he knock
on the door, right.

24:21.127 --> 24:23.029
This is your house you paid for,
you hear that knock on the door,

24:23.129 --> 24:25.197
you hide in your own
fucking house.

24:25.765 --> 24:27.233
Did Showtime at the Apollo.

24:27.333 --> 24:29.401
Everything was just
like perfect timing.

24:40.780 --> 24:43.182
After the show was on TV
when it came out,

24:43.282 --> 24:46.152
I was getting recognized so much
it was like insane.

24:46.252 --> 24:47.920
It was like some rock star shit

24:48.020 --> 24:49.722
that I've never experienced
in my life.

24:49.822 --> 24:51.023
I couldn't go nowhere.

24:51.123 --> 24:52.559
I had already done two movies

24:52.659 --> 24:54.861
and sitting on the last season
of Living Color

24:54.961 --> 24:56.162
before this even came out.

24:56.262 --> 24:57.864
And I was talking
to David Alan Grier,

24:57.964 --> 24:59.532
Jim Carrey and Jamie Foxx.

24:59.632 --> 25:00.633
And those guys was going,

25:00.733 --> 25:01.968
"David, are you on some TV show

25:02.068 --> 25:03.202
pulling some girl's
blanket off?"

25:03.302 --> 25:05.271
And then the whole world
just changed

25:05.371 --> 25:07.073
and it hit like a sonic boom.

25:11.544 --> 25:12.712
Robert.

25:12.812 --> 25:14.080
Hey, what's happening,
baby?

25:14.180 --> 25:16.315
How it is,
and how it feel to be you?

25:16.415 --> 25:18.217
I'm gonna go in here,
get me some hats.

25:18.585 --> 25:20.519
-What's with the hat?
-Oh.

25:20.620 --> 25:23.022
Well, one day I was on a bike

25:23.122 --> 25:24.423
and trying to be fly,

25:24.523 --> 25:26.192
had dreadlocks at the time,
and no helmet

25:26.292 --> 25:28.160
'cause I liked the dreadlocks
blowing through the wind.

25:28.260 --> 25:30.429
And some fool,
I guess he came out

25:30.529 --> 25:32.098
and hit me dead-on

25:32.198 --> 25:35.167
and left me there
bleeding in the street, ran off.

25:36.035 --> 25:37.670
I wake up in the ICU.

25:38.204 --> 25:39.939
This is where I had
the stitches.

25:40.573 --> 25:41.908
So how long ago this happen?

25:42.008 --> 25:43.309
About two or three weeks.

25:43.409 --> 25:45.444
I'm blessed to be here
talking and speaking

25:45.544 --> 25:47.747
and fully functioning
with motor skills.

25:47.847 --> 25:49.616
They had to cut a bone

25:49.716 --> 25:52.384
and make sure the bone
didn't go into my brain.

25:52.484 --> 25:55.254
My surgeons was like, wow,
you're doing remarkable.

25:55.354 --> 25:56.589
What could've happened,
you know,

25:56.689 --> 25:57.957
I could be in a wheelchair.

25:58.057 --> 26:00.126
I'm just lucky and thankful
to be alive.

26:00.226 --> 26:02.128
I really appreciate.

26:05.698 --> 26:07.266
Well, I'm sorry, David.

26:07.366 --> 26:10.870
I want you to know
that I'm genuinely sorry.

26:10.970 --> 26:12.238
And I'm sorry too.

26:12.338 --> 26:14.540
I didn't know what you
was going through.

26:14.641 --> 26:17.109
I would've never done
anything like that.

26:17.209 --> 26:19.178
I should've taken
the time to talk to you

26:19.278 --> 26:21.781
and I didn't give you
that opportunity

26:21.881 --> 26:24.583
to say what you wanted to say.

26:24.684 --> 26:27.553
I was very stubborn
at 23 years old

26:27.654 --> 26:29.421
and it was gonna be my way

26:29.521 --> 26:31.390
and how I felt
about the situation

26:31.490 --> 26:34.293
and not really trying
to even listen

26:34.393 --> 26:36.128
to what somebody else
was saying.

26:36.228 --> 26:37.897
And if I could go back,

26:37.997 --> 26:41.367
there'd be a lot of things that
all of us would do differently.

26:42.434 --> 26:45.672
-And I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry too, baby.

26:46.639 --> 26:48.808
That's all I can say.
I can't take it back.

26:48.908 --> 26:50.576
I accept your apology, baby.

26:50.943 --> 26:54.213
In '93,
all seven of us were talent

26:54.313 --> 26:57.016
and all we could do,
if there was an issue,

26:57.116 --> 26:58.617
is go to the producers

26:58.718 --> 27:02.288
to say what our gripes are
or our concerns.

27:02.388 --> 27:04.556
I think at the time
when people are saying,

27:04.657 --> 27:08.160
like I don't wanna be here
with him being here,

27:08.260 --> 27:09.762
what were they supposed to do

27:09.862 --> 27:14.200
if the concept is
everybody stays in the house.

27:14.300 --> 27:17.169
Yeah, maybe better decisions
could've been made

27:17.269 --> 27:18.805
but, at the time,

27:18.905 --> 27:21.307
I feel like they did
what they felt was necessary

27:21.407 --> 27:24.143
in order for the show
to continue going on.

27:24.243 --> 27:26.545
When y'all saw that young man
crying like that...

27:26.913 --> 27:29.115
I had went to such
a dark place

27:29.215 --> 27:31.250
but I had to fucking
find my way out.

27:31.617 --> 27:33.385
I've been through
some great times,

27:33.485 --> 27:35.121
I've been through
some rough times.

27:35.221 --> 27:36.723
Been married,
living in Beverly Hills.

27:36.823 --> 27:41.160
Got divorced. I've helped raise
my daughter who's 25 now.

27:41.260 --> 27:43.095
Wow,
I have a 25-year-old daughter!

27:43.195 --> 27:44.596
Can you believe that?

27:44.697 --> 27:46.766
And I'm still working
to get my reputation back.

27:46.866 --> 27:48.434
-Me too.
-Right?

27:48.534 --> 27:51.103
I'm the Black girl
who got the only Black guy

27:51.203 --> 27:52.739
-kicked off the show, so...
-Right. Right.

27:54.406 --> 27:57.710
A lot of people like to say
I'm the victim of this.

27:57.810 --> 27:59.545
I am nobody's victim.

27:59.645 --> 28:01.513
It's how you make it
work for you.

28:05.584 --> 28:06.853
I love you, baby.

28:14.994 --> 28:18.931
I mean, look, it was really hard
to see David break down.

28:19.031 --> 28:20.532
I feel terrible about it.

28:20.632 --> 28:24.003
I don't want him to have
any more pain about this.

28:24.103 --> 28:26.305
I can tell that he's going
through a lot

28:26.405 --> 28:27.940
in his life right now

28:28.040 --> 28:30.642
and I just want the best
for David.

28:32.578 --> 28:34.546
-I love you, bud.
-Love you too, man.

28:36.916 --> 28:40.686
I feel that a weight has
been lifted off my shoulders

28:40.787 --> 28:43.655
and you know what, I do feel
better that we got past this.

28:43.756 --> 28:46.292
I can't wait to bury
this son of a bitch

28:46.392 --> 28:48.795
and hope it never jumps
back out the grave again

28:48.895 --> 28:50.196
and just start anew
with everybody.

28:50.296 --> 28:51.798
'Cause I'm really trying

28:51.898 --> 28:54.366
and the reason why I'm trying,
because they're trying.

28:54.466 --> 28:57.536
-That was emotionally draining.
-That's right.

28:57.636 --> 28:59.271
That footage really
enlightened me

28:59.371 --> 29:01.808
on why people didn't like
each other when I got here.

29:01.908 --> 29:04.343
I was like, oh, wow.

29:04.443 --> 29:07.880
We can move forward. Everybody
said everything possible

29:07.980 --> 29:09.281
they could say about it.

29:09.381 --> 29:10.883
I think that really now

29:10.983 --> 29:13.119
everybody can take
a deep sigh of relief

29:13.219 --> 29:17.489
and say,
now finally that's behind us.

29:18.057 --> 29:20.059
David, I wanna talk to you.

29:20.960 --> 29:23.395
Let's go. You and me.

29:24.130 --> 29:25.832
Okay.

29:27.066 --> 29:31.237
So I know that you're hurting.

29:32.304 --> 29:35.842
Do you wanna keep talking
to me about it?

29:35.942 --> 29:38.010
I came because I wanted
to work through this.

29:38.110 --> 29:41.280
I spent a lot of time in therapy
because of that rape shit.

29:41.380 --> 29:42.815
Yeah, I'm sure. Yeah.

29:42.915 --> 29:46.152
It really sent me
to a couple of dark places.

29:46.252 --> 29:49.088
I still take therapy
because of that.

29:50.823 --> 29:52.024
And I apologize.

29:52.124 --> 29:53.759
I should not have used
that analogy.

29:53.860 --> 29:54.861
I apologize.

29:54.961 --> 29:56.128
And I accept your apology.

29:56.228 --> 29:58.397
And I'm not out
to get you at all.

29:58.497 --> 30:01.333
When Tami was upset
and she went into the kitchen,

30:01.433 --> 30:03.035
I wanted to go comfort her

30:03.135 --> 30:06.372
but I didn't because I didn't
want there to be an imbalance,

30:06.472 --> 30:07.806
you know what I mean?

30:07.907 --> 30:10.776
But I just want you to know
and understand,

30:10.877 --> 30:13.645
if you wanna talk to me
about it at any time...

30:13.745 --> 30:15.714
-We're good. Thank you.
-I'm here.

30:15.814 --> 30:17.049
I accept her apology.

30:17.149 --> 30:18.717
I apologized to her, too,

30:18.817 --> 30:22.521
because it's been 28 years
of carrying this stuff around

30:22.621 --> 30:25.324
and it feels good to be able
to say that.

30:25.424 --> 30:27.826
I'm ready to receive love
and give love.

30:27.927 --> 30:29.361
-What I'm saying is--
-The past is the past

30:29.461 --> 30:32.664
and we are here
to work through this.

30:32.764 --> 30:34.566
I just wanna make sure, okay.

30:34.666 --> 30:36.002
There's nothing left
to talk about.

30:36.102 --> 30:37.303
-We got it all out.
-Okay.

30:37.403 --> 30:38.770
Let's go be good
to one another.

30:38.871 --> 30:40.239
-I just wanna make sure, okay.
-It's all done.

30:40.339 --> 30:41.874
I forgive you and we're done.

30:41.974 --> 30:43.475
-We're good.
-Okay. Cool.

30:43.575 --> 30:46.946
-And we're respectful.
We did it.
-Okay.

30:47.779 --> 30:50.082
I know everybody
was all about David

30:50.182 --> 30:52.651
and how we've gotta
apologize to him

30:52.751 --> 30:54.186
and you should.

30:54.286 --> 30:57.089
But I want you to understand
that the moment with David

30:57.189 --> 31:00.826
would be nonexistent if
Tami wasn't fucked up mentally.

31:00.927 --> 31:03.695
I think that everybody
came into the house

31:03.795 --> 31:07.766
focused with removing
the stain from their back

31:07.866 --> 31:11.003
on the part they played
and giving him an apology.

31:11.103 --> 31:15.541
But as it pertains to me,
whatever I said, I really think,

31:15.641 --> 31:18.277
went in one ear
and out the other.

31:21.580 --> 31:23.015
What you got to drink?

31:23.115 --> 31:24.650
They ordered ice cream
and I got a milkshake.

31:24.750 --> 31:26.818
-Do you want some?
-Mm-mm.

31:26.919 --> 31:28.787
-Oh, I...
-I don't.

31:30.056 --> 31:31.823
I've been eating so much
of the wrong shit,

31:31.924 --> 31:33.092
I gave myself a headache,

31:33.192 --> 31:34.426
and I'm drinking
this goddamn beer

31:34.526 --> 31:37.063
that's giving me
all kinda heartburn.

31:37.163 --> 31:39.565
Jon, Beth S. and Irene

31:39.665 --> 31:41.400
should have been the people

31:41.500 --> 31:44.503
to have a little more empathy
for me in this moment,

31:44.603 --> 31:46.838
because they were the people
who were actually there.

31:46.939 --> 31:52.144
It's not easy for me to share,
and I just felt like...

31:52.511 --> 31:54.413
Y'all didn't hear what I said?

31:54.513 --> 31:56.515
That's some real shit for me.

31:56.615 --> 31:59.885
That to this day
I fight myself on it...

31:59.986 --> 32:04.390
to just have it
just not even addressed.

32:04.490 --> 32:06.825
Yeah. I know.

32:07.193 --> 32:08.995
-It was just hurtful.
-Yeah.

32:09.095 --> 32:13.165
I disclosed that I was dealing
with body dysmorphia,

32:13.265 --> 32:14.967
and it just went unaddressed.

32:15.067 --> 32:16.768
It just went ignored,

32:16.868 --> 32:21.840
and everybody in that moment,
to me, is like, full of shit.

32:26.812 --> 32:28.780
Everybody's going through shit,
yeah,

32:28.880 --> 32:30.482
but if anybody is looking
at me like,

32:30.582 --> 32:33.019
"Well, she's gonna be good,
'cause she's so strong."

32:33.119 --> 32:34.320
-Yeah.
-You know, like,

32:34.420 --> 32:35.521
I got feelings too.

32:35.621 --> 32:37.223
We're not all strong
all the time.

32:37.323 --> 32:41.260
Yeah, and just because you see
somebody who looks strong,

32:41.360 --> 32:42.961
does not mean

32:43.062 --> 32:45.731
-that I'm any less human.
-Right.

32:45.831 --> 32:47.466
When someone walks away
from a group,

32:47.566 --> 32:49.335
and they're clearly
emotionally upset,

32:49.435 --> 32:50.736
I give them a minute.

32:50.836 --> 32:52.704
And what that communicated
to Tami was,

32:52.804 --> 32:55.141
nobody else cares
about what I'm going through.

32:55.241 --> 32:56.642
But the truth of the matter is,

32:56.742 --> 32:58.744
I cared deeply about
what she was going through.

32:58.844 --> 33:00.412
And it's just kinda like...

33:02.048 --> 33:05.851
Well, damn,
nobody's gonna stick up for me?

33:06.518 --> 33:07.486
Yeah.

33:07.586 --> 33:09.021
And the two people who got up

33:09.121 --> 33:12.991
and came to talk to me
don't even fucking know me.

33:13.092 --> 33:14.926
-Beth and Glen.
-Right.

33:15.027 --> 33:16.862
In that moment,
it was just about,

33:16.962 --> 33:20.199
-"I'm exposed to the world."
-Right.

33:20.299 --> 33:22.000
And to be brave enough to say

33:22.101 --> 33:23.369
that you're experiencing
body dysmorphia.

33:23.469 --> 33:25.304
Things that people
don't talk about.

33:25.404 --> 33:26.505
Talk about.

33:26.605 --> 33:28.074
I wanna acknowledge
you were hurt.

33:28.174 --> 33:29.575
I was sitting next to you,
I absolutely hear you.

33:29.675 --> 33:30.709
Thank you.

33:31.610 --> 33:35.214
I think that people have
to understand that in 1993,

33:35.314 --> 33:37.349
Tami did not disclose.

33:37.449 --> 33:42.020
Tami was not open enough about
what Tami was going through.

33:42.121 --> 33:45.857
I wasn't very honest
with my body dysmorphia.

33:45.957 --> 33:49.061
No matter
how I looked to others,

33:49.161 --> 33:51.663
I was not happy with myself.

33:51.763 --> 33:56.168
Even today, it's a fight for me
to just wake up and go,

33:56.268 --> 33:59.771
"Sis, you've got it going on.
Love yourself."

33:59.871 --> 34:02.141
I've made that a part
of my mantra,

34:02.241 --> 34:04.843
but I'm still working
on actually believing it.

34:04.943 --> 34:07.913
And so,
having this conversation,

34:08.013 --> 34:12.351
reliving those clips,
it was uncomfortable.

34:12.451 --> 34:16.622
It made me vulnerable.
It was hard for me.

34:20.326 --> 34:22.060
-Hello?
-Hey, Nabs.

34:22.161 --> 34:24.196
-Yeah, what's up?
-So how you doing?

34:24.296 --> 34:27.099
I'm good.
Just been busy, but I'm good.

34:27.199 --> 34:30.169
I decided to call my daughter,
and have lunch with her.

34:30.269 --> 34:32.171
-How's your boyfriend?
-He's good.

34:32.271 --> 34:34.573
-You guys gotta meet soon.
-Yeah.

34:34.673 --> 34:37.008
If Mom approves
then he's a good guy,

34:37.109 --> 34:38.877
-but Mom doesn't like everybody.
-All right.

34:38.977 --> 34:40.679
My daughter's 25 now.

34:40.779 --> 34:44.049
She's a young woman, and
I want to tell her everything,

34:44.150 --> 34:46.752
and see her reaction to it.

34:54.360 --> 34:56.162
-What up, Nabs?
-Hi, Daddy.

34:56.262 --> 34:58.897
-Hey. How you doing?
-Good, how are you?

34:58.997 --> 35:01.800
Good. Good to see you.
You look amazing.

35:01.900 --> 35:03.369
-Thank you.
-How you doing?

35:03.469 --> 35:05.171
Sit over here.

35:06.138 --> 35:07.339
You want me to sit here?

35:07.439 --> 35:09.007
I'm very, very close
to my daughter.

35:09.107 --> 35:12.144
And Black fathers,
we get a bad rep, so...

35:12.244 --> 35:13.612
They can call me
whatever you want,

35:13.712 --> 35:15.781
but you can't call me
a deadbeat dad,

35:15.881 --> 35:18.384
and that to me,
that's the proudest thing ever.

35:18.984 --> 35:20.919
So how's everything been?

35:21.019 --> 35:22.354
I haven't really got
to talk to you much

35:22.454 --> 35:23.955
since you've been in the house.

35:24.055 --> 35:26.458
-It can get emotional at times.
-Yeah?

35:26.825 --> 35:29.828
I'm very proud
of my daughter. I lucked up.

35:29.928 --> 35:32.498
I be hearing horror stories
about other people's daughters.

35:32.598 --> 35:35.467
My daughter's never gave me
any kind of trouble.

35:35.567 --> 35:38.036
It's so spooky.
She is the light of my life.

35:38.404 --> 35:40.439
It's hard, reliving the past,

35:40.539 --> 35:44.343
and yours was recorded,
so I couldn't even imagine.

35:44.710 --> 35:47.479
Everybody is trying to correct
their ways,

35:47.579 --> 35:51.250
and explaining their angle
on shit, and the reason why.

35:51.350 --> 35:53.285
I think that's the most
therapeutic part

35:53.385 --> 35:54.986
about this experience.

35:55.086 --> 35:57.556
It's just been... It's been a
heavy process for me, though.

35:57.656 --> 35:58.990
Yeah.

35:59.090 --> 36:01.360
Keep rehashing this blanket
incident with Tami.

36:02.194 --> 36:03.629
I feel bad for her,

36:03.729 --> 36:05.831
but it doesn't sit well with me
on how she handled it.

36:05.931 --> 36:08.400
She affected your career bad.

36:08.500 --> 36:11.337
She apologized,
and Beth apologized

36:11.437 --> 36:14.240
for labeling me as a rapist,
and so did Irene.

36:14.340 --> 36:16.242
So what are you learning
from the experience?

36:16.342 --> 36:19.411
I'm learning how everybody

36:19.511 --> 36:21.580
has a different perspective
on the same thing.

36:22.781 --> 36:25.183
Everybody sees it
a different fucking way.

36:25.284 --> 36:27.619
And I'm learning,
some people have grown.

36:27.719 --> 36:29.087
I know I've grown.

36:29.187 --> 36:30.589
It takes a lot of courage
to relive that,

36:30.689 --> 36:32.724
'cause I don't think
I could've, you know?

36:32.824 --> 36:35.026
So I'm proud of you for that.

36:35.126 --> 36:36.295
Appreciate it.

36:36.762 --> 36:38.297
I am thankful to hear

36:38.397 --> 36:40.198
my daughter's perspective
on things,

36:40.299 --> 36:43.769
and how much she really,
really, really have my back.

36:43.869 --> 36:46.104
It just made me one proud papa.

36:46.204 --> 36:48.039
I'm still gonna give Beth
the side-eye, though.

36:49.875 --> 36:51.577
I don't trust her.

36:58.384 --> 36:59.318
-Hi.
-Hey.

36:59.418 --> 37:02.488
-Hey.
-Hi. You okay?

37:02.821 --> 37:04.690
-Yeah.
-Good.

37:05.591 --> 37:08.126
-I'm good.
-Okay.

37:08.226 --> 37:09.395
You know,
when we were sitting there,

37:09.495 --> 37:10.996
and you went into the kitchen,

37:11.096 --> 37:12.564
I wanted to go into the kitchen

37:12.664 --> 37:14.300
when you went into the kitchen,
but I was like...

37:14.400 --> 37:16.568
Girl, don't come up here
with that bullshit.

37:16.668 --> 37:17.936
What?

37:18.036 --> 37:19.505
-I'm-a tell you honestly.
-Tell me. What?

37:19.605 --> 37:21.206
I feel like when a person
wants to do something,

37:21.307 --> 37:22.774
they do something.

37:23.442 --> 37:26.011
Beth A wanted to get up,
she got up,

37:26.111 --> 37:28.213
and said, "Tami, I heard you."

37:28.314 --> 37:30.882
Glen wanted to get up,
he got up.

37:30.982 --> 37:33.719
And I felt very, like, hurt,

37:33.819 --> 37:36.988
because I feel like y'all
were the people

37:37.088 --> 37:39.325
that were in the house,
that were there.

37:39.425 --> 37:41.693
In the moment,
if you were listening,

37:41.793 --> 37:44.162
I shared some real shit,
but at the same time,

37:44.262 --> 37:46.898
something was shared
that was minimized

37:46.998 --> 37:48.800
and pushed to the side.

37:48.900 --> 37:52.237
You know what that taught me?
Y'all don't give a fuck.

37:52.604 --> 37:54.005
Okay. Well, that's not true.

37:54.105 --> 37:55.474
I believe that is true,

37:55.574 --> 37:56.808
and nothing you say is gonna
make me change it,

37:56.908 --> 37:58.477
-especially in these two weeks.
-Okay.

37:58.577 --> 38:01.079
So I feel like
it just is what it is.

38:01.179 --> 38:02.781
-Ugh. Wow.
-It just is what it is,

38:02.881 --> 38:05.150
and it's okay.

38:05.250 --> 38:08.487
-Sorry. I'm sorry.
-I don't want no sorries.

38:08.587 --> 38:10.356
I don't want none of that.

38:10.456 --> 38:12.991
Don't do that. I don't want it.
I don't receive it.

38:13.625 --> 38:15.794
This whole situation
is really hard.

38:15.894 --> 38:18.330
I'm obviously on Tami's side,

38:18.430 --> 38:20.532
but I'm a little shocked
that Tami thinks

38:20.632 --> 38:22.968
that I was taking David's side
over her side.

38:23.068 --> 38:28.106
I just... I don't know what the
best thing to do is right now.

38:28.206 --> 38:29.875
Okay, I know you don't
believe me,

38:29.975 --> 38:32.210
-but I mean, I care, Tami.
-But can you...

38:32.310 --> 38:33.845
Can you receive that
we're here now, Tami?

38:33.945 --> 38:35.180
I do care.

38:35.280 --> 38:37.115
Can you receive
that we're here right now

38:37.215 --> 38:38.450
-because we care.
-I do. I do receive

38:38.550 --> 38:39.785
that you guys are here now.

38:39.885 --> 38:41.319
-I mean, I love you, but...
-I receive

38:41.420 --> 38:42.454
that you are here now.

38:42.554 --> 38:45.457
This is just Tami realizing,

38:45.557 --> 38:48.326
I don't let people in,
and there's a reason for that.

38:48.427 --> 38:49.795
And I'm-a go back to that.

38:49.895 --> 38:51.697
Okay. I'm sorry that
you feel that way,

38:51.797 --> 38:54.700
because it's just not true,
Tami.

38:55.100 --> 38:56.602
I do care.

38:56.702 --> 38:58.069
Well, that's how I feel.

38:58.169 --> 38:59.438
It's not true.

38:59.538 --> 39:01.172
Well, I don't fuck
with y'all like that.

39:12.451 --> 39:13.985
I'm used to people
not giving a fuck.

39:14.085 --> 39:16.422
But that's not true.
I do give a fuck, Tami.

39:17.489 --> 39:18.857
You should not let it
hurt your feelings.

39:18.957 --> 39:20.258
We're grown-ass women
right now, okay?

39:20.358 --> 39:21.660
I know, but I mean,

39:21.760 --> 39:23.261
I was really enjoying
to get to know her.

39:23.361 --> 39:26.498
I would love to know
why she feels the need

39:26.598 --> 39:28.133
to have Tami like her so much.

39:28.867 --> 39:31.369
-You still a virgin?
-Am I still a virgin? Yes.

39:31.470 --> 39:34.706
I would like for you to get
some pussy before you die.

39:35.240 --> 39:37.308
It's the same story,
28 years later.

39:40.045 --> 39:41.847
On and on, all the bullshit.

39:41.947 --> 39:44.049
Just keep on...

39:47.586 --> 39:49.087
Gin.

39:50.088 --> 39:52.458
He's going there.
He threw a fucking apple at me.

39:52.558 --> 39:53.825
I ain't fucking doing it.

39:53.925 --> 39:56.027
Has alcohol been
a struggle for you in your life?

39:57.829 --> 40:00.031
No comment!
