WEBVTT

00:00.600 --> 00:02.200
  <i>PREVIOUSLY ON</i>
 <i>"BROTHERS & SISTERS"...</i>

00:02.200 --> 00:05.700
SO WE HAVE A DEAL?
  WE ARE GOING TO MAKE
BEAUTIFUL WINE TOGETHER.

00:05.700 --> 00:08.700
  YOU DO KNOW THAT YOUR HUSBAND
  MADE A PASS AT REBECCA?

00:08.700 --> 00:10.600
IT WAS STUPID, INEXCUSABLE,

00:10.600 --> 00:12.900
AND THE SECOND IT HAPPENED,
I STOPPED.

00:12.900 --> 00:15.200
 YOU BRING ALL YOUR
FIRST DATES HEREDON'T YOU?

00:15.200 --> 00:17.200
YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST WOMAN
  I'VE EVER BROUGHT--

00:17.200 --> 00:21.200
  YOU <i>ARE</i> ANOTHER CHARMING,
  INTELLIGENT LOUSE.

00:21.600 --> 00:25.600
  I AM GUESSING THAT JOE
DID NOT JUST COME ON TO YOU OUT OF THE BLUE.

00:25.600 --> 00:28.300
JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE A WHORE,
 IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT I AM.

00:28.300 --> 00:30.400
YOU THINK THAT MAYBE SHE CAN
  STAY HERE WHILE THINGS,

00:30.400 --> 00:31.600
LIKE, SORT OF CALM DOWN?

00:31.600 --> 00:33.400
YOU'RE WELCOME HERE.
  YOU'RE FAMILY.

00:33.400 --> 00:37.300
WOULD YOU GIVE ME
 THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRY
TO MAKE IT UP TO YOU?

00:37.400 --> 00:38.800
WILL YOU MARRY ME?

00:45.000 --> 00:46.500
  TOMMY, I NEED TO KNOW

00:46.500 --> 00:49.000
  HOW MANY OF THEM
ARE ACTUALLY COMING.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
ALL OF THEM, EXCEPT FOR JOE.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.900
 AT LEAST,
THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN TOLD.

00:53.200 --> 00:55.600
 YOU MAKE THEM SOUND
LIKE AN INVADING ARMY.

00:55.600 --> 00:57.900
  WELL, GIVEN EVERYTHING
 THAT'S HAPPENED,

00:57.900 --> 01:00.100
 I'M SLIGHTLY CONCERNED
  ABOUT THEM ALL BEING HERE

01:00.100 --> 01:02.100
  WITH OUR POTENTIAL INVESTORS.

01:02.100 --> 01:04.400
 I MEAN, THE COMBINATION
  OF THE WALKER FAMILY

01:04.400 --> 01:06.900
  WITH ENDLESS AMOUNTS
  OF ALCOHOL... (laughs)

01:07.700 --> 01:10.100
 OKAY, I GET IT.
IT'S REALLY, REALLY FUNNY.

01:10.100 --> 01:12.100
LOOK, HOLLY,

01:12.100 --> 01:14.600
 THEY'RE NOT TEENAGERS
AT A KEGGER, ALL RIGHT?

01:14.600 --> 01:16.800
THIS... THIS IS OUR OPENING.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.400
 THEY'LL, UH,
THEY'LBEHAVE.

01:18.400 --> 01:20.900
OOH! RIGHT IN THE RIBS.

01:20.900 --> 01:23.000
THEY'RE KICKING?
YEAH, BOTH OF THEM.

01:23.200 --> 01:26.000
IT'S THE ORANGE JUICE.
  THE SUGAR MAKES THEM NUTS.

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
TOMMY, I KNOW THAT THIS
  NEVER WOULD HAVE HAPPENED WITHOUT YOU AND YOUR FATHER.

01:30.900 --> 01:33.500
  YOUR FAMILY COMES
  WITH THE PACKAGE.

01:34.200 --> 01:36.000
  ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS

01:36.000 --> 01:37.800
  YOU CAN SAY
ABOUT MY FAMILY.

01:37.800 --> 01:41.500
BOTTOM LINE--WHEN IT COUNTS,

01:41.600 --> 01:42.800
 THEY SHOW UP.

01:43.600 --> 01:44.600
I'M NOT GOING.

01:45.300 --> 01:49.200
  OHH. SO YOU'RE SENDING
  A STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE AS YOUR PROXY,

01:49.200 --> 01:50.200
 OR IS THIS FOR ME?

01:50.200 --> 01:51.400
I JUST CAN'T RIGHT NOW.

01:51.400 --> 01:53.800
BETWEEN WORK AND THE DISASTER
THAT IS MY MARRIAGE,

01:53.800 --> 01:55.500
THINGS COULDN'T GET ANY WORSE,
  EXCEPT OF COURSE

01:55.500 --> 01:59.000
 IF JOE AND I WERE TO SPEND
A COZY WEEKEND AT A VINEYARD WHERE EVERYBODY KNOWS

01:59.000 --> 02:01.600
  THAT HE TONGUED
MY 20-YEAR-OLD HALF SISTER.
  ALL RIGHT.

02:01.600 --> 02:03.000
  WELL, YOU KNOW, SARAH,
  YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO,

02:03.000 --> 02:04.800
  AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO
  JUSTIFY IT TO ANYBODY.

02:04.800 --> 02:08.199
  EVERYBODY IS GOING
  TO UNDERSTAND, EVEN TOMMY.
EVEN MOM?

02:08.199 --> 02:09.900
  WELL, YOU KNOW,
  DON'T WORRY ABOUT MOM.

02:09.900 --> 02:12.200
  THIS IS ABOUT YOU.
  NOW HOW ARE YOU?

02:12.200 --> 02:15.600
  I'VE BEEN BAKING, AND I
NEVER BAKE. SO YOU TELL ME.

02:15.600 --> 02:17.000
 YOU'RE BAD. IT'S BAD.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.300
HE KEEPS WANTING
TO TALK ABOUT IT,AND I JUST CAN'T HEAR IT.

02:20.300 --> 02:22.200
  AND IT'S NOT EVEN
ABOUT THE KISS ANYMORE.

02:22.500 --> 02:25.200
  THINGS HAVE BEEN SAID.
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO GO BACK.

02:25.200 --> 02:27.100
 I'M TOO SCARED
TO MOVE FORWARD.

02:27.100 --> 02:30.100
IT'S JUST LIKE WE'RE STUCK
IN RELATIONSHIP PURGATORY,

02:30.100 --> 02:32.100
WHICH FEELS MORE LIKE
 RELATIONSHIP HELL.

02:33.700 --> 02:36.400
GOD.  OH, SARAH, 
  I'M SO, SO SORRY.

02:37.200 --> 02:38.800
  IS THERE ANYTHING
 THAT I CAN DO?

02:38.800 --> 02:42.000
JUST KEEP MY CAKE LEVEL.
  WHEELS UP FOR D.C.
  TOMORROW AT 7:00.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.800
  YOU'RE COMING WITH.
  CONSIDER YOURSELF PACKED.

02:45.200 --> 02:46.500
NATOR.
 SARAH.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.600
  WHAT HAPPENS IN D.C.?

02:48.800 --> 02:50.400
  UH, NOTHING.

02:51.100 --> 02:53.900
UM... KITTY, IF YOU CAN'T
DELIVER THE CAKE,

02:53.900 --> 02:55.200
JU TELL ME.
 NO, NO, NO, NO, SARAH.

02:55.200 --> 02:57.800
  I AM YOUR BEARER
  OF ALL THINGS PASTRY.

02:57.800 --> 02:59.100
THANK YOU. OKAY, THEN.

02:59.100 --> 03:03.800
WELL, UM,
I WILL LEAVE YOU TWO TO DISCUSS POLITICS OR...

03:03.800 --> 03:05.900
 JUST STOP.
WHATEVER IT IS
YOU TALK ABOUT.

03:05.900 --> 03:07.200
 SENATOR.

03:08.800 --> 03:10.100
 THANKS FOR COMING BY.

03:11.000 --> 03:11.700
WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?

03:11.700 --> 03:15.200
OH, I CAN'T GO TO D.C.
 I HAVE A FAMILY OBLIGATION.

03:15.300 --> 03:16.900
  TO DELIVER A CAKE?
 WELL...

03:16.900 --> 03:19.300
 OKAY, MAYBE I NEED TO BE
MORE OBVIOUS THAN LINGERIE.

03:19.900 --> 03:23.000
  I'M GOING BACK TO VOTE
IN FAVOR OF SCOL VOUCHERS,

03:23.000 --> 03:26.300
  AND I'M GOING TO HAVE
PLENTY OF TIME TO DISCUSS THE OTHER IMPORTANT
 ISSUES OF THE DAY LIKE 

03:26.500 --> 03:28.300
THE LITTLE QUESTION
  YOU POPPED.

03:29.300 --> 03:31.200
  OH. OH, YEAH.

03:32.400 --> 03:33.000
WOW.

03:34.600 --> 03:35.400
 "WOW"?

03:35.500 --> 03:38.600
WELL, YEAH. I MEAN,
  IT WAS A REALLY BIG QUESTION,

03:38.600 --> 03:41.600
  AND I... YOU KNOW,
I JUST THINK...

03:42.200 --> 03:45.000
  I THINK THAT MY TIMING
 WAS A LITTLE OFF.

03:45.200 --> 03:47.900
KITTY, WHAT ARYOU
  TRYING TO SAY?

03:48.900 --> 03:50.700
MY SISTER'S MARRIAGE
  IS FALLING APART,

03:50.700 --> 03:51.900
  AND I JUST DON'T THINK
  THAT THIS IS THE TIME

03:51.900 --> 03:55.800
TO BE FLASHING SOME BIG ROCK
IN HER FACE.
"FLASHING SOME BIG ROCK

03:55.800 --> 03:58.700
 IT'S A FIGURE OF SPEECH.
  THAT IS--NO, IT'S NOT LITERAL.

03:58.700 --> 04:00.800
THAT'S A LITTLE PRESUMPTUOUS,
  DON'T YOU THINK?
  IT'S AN EXPRESSION.

04:00.800 --> 04:03.400
  ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO ASKED ME.
 YES, I DID.

04:03.400 --> 04:04.600
YOU ASKED ME TO MARRY YOU,

04:04.600 --> 04:07.100
AND NOW YOU ARE COMPLETELY
 TAKING IT BACK.
I'M NOT.

04:07.600 --> 04:10.400
 IT'S--IT'S JUST THAT
  I WANT THINGS TO CALM DOWN

04:10.400 --> 04:12.500
A LITTLE BIT WITH SARAH,
  THAT'S ALL.

04:12.500 --> 04:14.900
SO YOU'RE PUTTING A PIN
  IN YOUR PROPOSAL?

04:15.700 --> 04:16.700
FOR HOW LONG?
 (mutters)

04:18.700 --> 04:21.000
OH, YOU ARE BEING
THE WORST KIND OF POLITICIAN.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.200
OKAY, LOOK, SPEND THE TIME
WITH YOUR FAMILY,

04:23.700 --> 04:25.000
 AND WE'LL TALK
WHEN I GET BACK.

04:28.200 --> 04:29.400
I NEED YOU TO TAKE THE CAKE.

04:29.600 --> 04:31.900
WHY, BECAUSE YOU HAVE A BUSINESS
TRIP WITH YOUR BOYFRIEND?

04:31.900 --> 04:33.200
 WELL, YEAH.

04:33.200 --> 04:36.900
WE'VE--WE'VE GOT SOME VERY
  IMPORTANT ISSUES TO DEAL WITH,

04:36.900 --> 04:40.800
  LIKE <i>WORK</i> ISSUES.
  REALLY? IS IT ABOUT
GLOBAL WARMING? THAT'S FANTAS--

04:40.800 --> 04:42.500
  OH, NO.
WRONG POLITICAL PARTY.

04:42.600 --> 04:44.900
ARE YOU GONNA RESOLVE THE WAR
  IN IRAQ? THAT'S FANT--

04:44.900 --> 04:47.000
  OHAGAIN,
WRONG POLITICAL PARTY.

04:47.000 --> 04:51.800
SO HONESTLY, ANYTHING SHORT
OF THAT ISN'T AS IMPORTANT AS THE OPENING OF
OUR BROTHER'S NEW BUSINESS.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.400
 WHAT ABOUT T SARAH FACTOR
 IN ALL THIS?

04:54.400 --> 04:56.500
  HAVE YOU CONSIDERETHAT?

04:57.000 --> 04:58.900
 I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT.
  OHH.

04:59.100 --> 05:00.900
 HOLLY HAS BASICALLY
  RUINED HER LIFE,

05:00.900 --> 05:04.400
  AND WE'RE SUPPOSED TO SHOW UP
 AND--AND PLAY ALL "NICEY-NICE"?

05:04.400 --> 05:07.400
AND--OH, I MEAN, I KNOW IT'S
  FOR TOMMY AND ALL, BUT...

05:08.600 --> 05:10.900
  (sighs) I REALLY DON'T
  FEEL COMFORTABLE BEING THERE.

05:12.300 --> 05:14.400
WELL, NOW THAT YOU SAY IT LIKE
THAT, IS IT OKAY FOR <i>ME</i> TO GO?

05:14.400 --> 05:16.200
 YEAH. OH, YEAH.
  WHY?

05:16.200 --> 05:18.500
  IT'S TOTALLY DIFFERENT
  BECAUSE, UM,

05:18.500 --> 05:20.600
  BECAUSE, UH,
  YOU'RE A BROTHER.

05:20.800 --> 05:23.500
 YEAH. YOU'RE A BOY. MM!

05:24.900 --> 05:26.200
 I LOVE YOU.

05:30.700 --> 05:34.300
 HERE. WOULD YOU PLEASE
 JUST TAKE IT?
 LOOK,

05:34.300 --> 05:35.800
  I'M NOT GOING
TO A VINEYARD BY MYSELF.

05:35.800 --> 05:38.400
OKAY, LOOK, KITTY AND I JUST THINK IT'S A LITTLE
UNFAIR TO SARAH IF WE GO,

05:38.400 --> 05:40.100
AND YOU'RE NOT
IN THE SAME PICKLE AS--
  PICKLE?

05:40.100 --> 05:41.800
OKAY, FINE, WHATEVER. JAM.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.100
LOOK, YOU'RE FRIENDS
  WITH REBECCA,

05:43.100 --> 05:45.800
SO JUST CONSIDER YOURSELF
  SWITZERLAND.
  OKAY, LOOK,

05:45.800 --> 05:47.300
 SHE DOESN'T EVEN TALK
 TO HOLLY ANYMORE,

05:47.300 --> 05:49.700
  AND YOU ARE NUTS IF YOU THINK
MOM'S GONNA LET YOU OUT OF THIS.

05:49.700 --> 05:50.400
WHAT'S MOM GONNA DO,

05:50.400 --> 05:52.500
 CALL A FAMILY MEETING
AND FORCE US ALL TO GO?

05:52.700 --> 05:55.300
NOW LISTEN, I UNDERSTAND
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GO.

05:55.300 --> 05:58.800
  YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO YOUR
 HEART, ESPECIALLY YOU, SARAH.

05:59.100 --> 06:01.000
 I MEANIT'S GONNA BE
 HARD ON TOMMY,

06:01.000 --> 06:03.100
  BUT HE'S DEALT WITH
 DISAPPOINTMENT BEFORE.

06:03.100 --> 06:05.200
 MOM, WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
 TO DO WITH THAT?

06:05.200 --> 06:06.700
ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
I'LL GO IF YOU GUYS GO,

06:06.700 --> 06:08.700
 BUT I'M NOT SHOWING UP
 ALONE WITH MOM

06:08.700 --> 06:11.800
  AND A STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE.
  THAT SEEMS VERY...
OH! YOU KNOW, I RESENT THAT.

06:11.800 --> 06:13.600
 YOU WERE JUST ABOUT
TO SAY "GAY."
 NO, I WASN'T.

06:13.600 --> 06:14.500
  YES, YOU WERE.
NO, I WASN'T. I WASN'T.

06:14.500 --> 06:16.200
YOU'RE SUCH A CHILD.
  (Nora) HEY, BOYS.

06:16.200 --> 06:18.900
 LISTEN, WHY DID YOU ALL HAVE TO
  TURN THIS INTO A FEDERAL CASE?

06:18.900 --> 06:22.200
  I WAS TRYING
  TO BOW OUT GRACEFULLY.
BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING

06:22.200 --> 06:25.700
 YOU'RE MAKING THINGS WORSE.
  SARAH, I TOLD YOU
 YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO.

06:25.700 --> 06:27.900
  YOU SAY THAT, MOM,
 G@BUT I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA SAY

06:27.900 --> 06:31.900
 HOW I DIDN'T SUPPORT TOMMY.
 <i>SHE'S</i> THE ONE WHO CONVINCED US
THIS IS WHAT YOU'D WANT.

06:31.900 --> 06:33.800
  I BROUGHT YOU A CAKE
  TO DELIVER, KITTY.

06:33.800 --> 06:35.700
I DIDN'T ASK YOU
 TO START A NATIONAL MOVEMENT.

06:35.700 --> 06:38.600
  LISTEN, EVERYONE,
JUST STOP IT. PLEASE GO.

06:38.800 --> 06:40.600
I'M TOTALLY FINE
 WITH IT, OKAY?

06:44.900 --> 06:47.100
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT,
 THIS IS THE THING.

06:47.700 --> 06:50.400
THE THING IS, IS THAT IT'S--
  WELL, THE--THE TRUTH IS,

06:50.400 --> 06:52.400
 IS THAT IT'S A REALLY
BAD WEEKEND FOR ME, TOO.

06:52.400 --> 06:53.800
OH, FOR <i>YOU.</i>

06:54.300 --> 06:58.100
OH! OH, I THOUGHT YOU WERE DOING
  IT OUT OF COMPSION FOR ME.
WELL, I WAS.

06:58.100 --> 07:00.800
 I WAS, BUT I STILL HAVE TO GO
TO WASHINGTON WITH THE SENATOR.

07:00.800 --> 07:03.700
 IT'S--IT'S--
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT.

07:03.800 --> 07:06.900
  OH.
  KITTY, HE'S YOUR BOYFRIEND,
HIS NAME IS BOB,

07:06.900 --> 07:08.700
  AND YOU SEE HIM EVERY DAY.

07:08.700 --> 07:11.700
  WELL, WHAT HAPPENED
TO FOLLOWING OUR HEARTS, MOTHER?

07:11.700 --> 07:14.500
  I WAS REFERRING TO SARAH'S
HEART, NOT YOUR HEART.
NOT--

07:14.500 --> 07:16.800
  MOM, MOM,
IT'S TOP SECRET.

07:16.800 --> 07:18.100
  OH, OH, IT'S NOT...

07:18.800 --> 07:22.800
  IT'S NOT <i>TOP</i> SECRET,
 BUT IT--YES, IT'S, UH, 

07:23.000 --> 07:23.700
IT IS.

07:23.700 --> 07:26.500
 IT'S A VERY SENSITIVE
NATIONAL SECURITY THING,

07:26.500 --> 07:28.900
  AND I'M--I'M SORRY,
 THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY ABOUT IT.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.200
  I'M SORRY. "THING"?

07:32.600 --> 07:36.300
THAT'S WHY McCALLISTER
  GAVE YOU A BAG OF LINGERIE TO TAKE WITH YOU?

07:36.300 --> 07:37.700
 OH, YEAH.
  I CAN SEE THE FATE...
  OH, SARAH.

07:37.700 --> 07:41.700
 OF THE FREE WORLD
  HANGS IN THE BALANCE.
APPARENTLY, THAT'S NOT

07:42.000 --> 07:44.800
  OH, THAT'S FUNNY, JUSTIN.
WHEN DID YOU GET TO BE SO FUNNY?

07:44.800 --> 07:47.400
  KITTY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
 YOUR EXCUSE PALES IN COMPARISON

07:47.500 --> 07:49.200
 WITH ME HAVING TO SPEND
THE WHOLE WEEKEND

07:49.200 --> 07:51.800
  BEING WATCHED BY
  THE WICKED WITCH OF THE WEST.
  SARAH.

07:56.700 --> 07:58.000
 THIS IS A FAMILY THING,
ISN'T IT?

07:58.000 --> 07:59.500
 I-I WAS JUST COMING
 TO MAKE A SANDWICH,

07:59.500 --> 08:01.500
  BUT I'LL COME BACK LATER.
  YOU KNOW WHAT?

08:01.500 --> 08:03.500
I'LL MAKE YOU A SANDWICH
 IN JUST A FEW MOMENTS.

08:03.500 --> 08:04.800
  JUST GIVE US A FEW MOMENTS.

08:04.800 --> 08:05.800
OKAY. SORRY.

08:05.800 --> 08:06.500
 OKAY.

08:11.900 --> 08:15.500
  WOW.
  THAT WAS A REALITY CHECK.

08:15.600 --> 08:17.100
  SARAH, I TOLD YOU,

08:17.300 --> 08:19.600
AND IT'S JUST UNTIL
 SHE FINDS ANOTHER PLACE TO GO.

08:19.600 --> 08:22.400
  LISTEN, I KNOW, AND, UM,
  I THOUGHT I WAS FINE WITH IT.

08:22.400 --> 08:23.600
 I REALLY DID.
  (jingles keys)

08:25.900 --> 08:27.100
  WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
 HOME, MOM.

08:27.100 --> 08:29.100
 I CAN'T SIT AROUND WATCHING
 YOU RUN A BED-AND-BREAKFAST

08:29.100 --> 08:30.300
  FOR THE GIRL
THAT RUINED MY MARRIAGE.

08:30.300 --> 08:32.000
  WOULD YOU MIND
GIVING TMY MY CAKE

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
  AND TELL HIM THAT I LOVE HIM?

08:40.600 --> 08:43.799
SARAH? CAN I TALK TO YOU
  FOR A SECOND?

08:46.200 --> 08:47.900
  WHAT IS IT?
IT'S KIND OF LATE.

08:48.500 --> 08:52.500
 UM... I JUST WANTED
 TO SAY I'M SORRY...

08:54.000 --> 08:56.100
FOR ALL OF THIS. I-I FEEL TERRIBLE.

08:58.100 --> 09:02.100

11:42.600 --> 11:44.200
  I DIDN'T REALIZE
  THAT YOU DIDN'T KNOW.

11:44.200 --> 11:46.800
WELL, I MEAN, SHE COULD HAVE
BEEN IN A DITCH OR ANYWHERE.

11:46.800 --> 11:49.600
HOLD ON, HOLD ON. THERE'S NO
POINT IN BEING UPSET.

12:15.800 --> 12:18.400
REBECCA MOVED OUT OF MY HOUSE,
 AND YOU ASSUMED THAT

12:18.400 --> 12:20.600
  SHE WAS WHAT,
CHECKING IN WITH ME?

12:20.600 --> 12:22.100
 WELL, YOU KNEW SHE WAS

WHY DIDN'T YOU
 JUST PICK UP THE PHONE? HI.
  OH, THANK YOU.

12:25.500 --> 12:27.900
  I DIDN'T REALIZE THERE WAS
 A PARENTAL NOTIFICATN LAW

12:27.900 --> 12:30.100
 THAT REQUIRES THAT I REPORT
  ON A 20-SOMETHING.

12:30.100 --> 12:32.000
 I DIDN'T THINK I NEEDED
 TO GET INVOLVED.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.500
INVOLVED? WELL, LET ME

12:34.500 --> 12:37.600

 BUT THIS IS BETWEEN
  YOU AND REBECCA.

12:45.300 --> 12:47.700
  I HAVE MY OWN CHILDREN
  TO DEAL WITH.
OH, REALLY?

12:47.800 --> 12:51.000

  OF YOUR HOSPITALITY?

12:52.000 --> 12:53.900
  I DON'T APPRECIATE
YOUR ATTITUDE,

12:54.200 --> 12:56.100
AND I WOULD THINK YOU WOULD
  BE JUST A LITTLE BIT GRATEFUL

12:56.100 --> 12:58.500
  TO KNOW THAT YOUR DAUGHTER
  IS SAFE AND SOUND.

12:58.500 --> 13:01.100

THE COMBINATION OF WHICH IS GIVING ME
A COLOSSAL HEADACHE,

14:53.000 --> 14:56.600
and it's only
 gonna be compounded  BY THE AMOUNT OF WINE

14:56.600 --> 14:58.100

15:55.500 --> 15:58.100
 I THOUGHT IN TEXAS,
THEY DRANK WINE OUT OF BOXES.

15:58.300 --> 16:00.900
HAS ANYONE EVER TOLD YOU
 YOU ARE A SNOB?
MM-HMM.

16:01.200 --> 16:01.600
 AH.

16:01.600 --> 16:03.800
I PREFER TO THINK
MY PROBLEM IS GOOD TASTE.

16:04.100 --> 16:05.900
SPEAKING OF WHICH,

16:05.900 --> 16:09.100
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TTAKE A ROMANTIC WALK WITH ME

  I'M FINE.

16:26.900 --> 16:29.000
OH, MY CAKE
IS ALL SMUSHED.

16:30.300 --> 16:31.000
I JUST--YOU KNOW,

16:31.000 --> 16:33.200
I WISH THAT EVERYBODY
 WASN'T TREATING JOE

16:33.200 --> 16:35.300
LIKE HE WAS RADIOACTIVE.

16:35.500 --> 16:38.200
  OH, SWEETHEART, I THINK YOU'RE
 EXAGGERATING JUST A LITTLE BIT.

16:38.200 --> 16:40.600
WELL, YOU DIDN'T KISS HIM,
  AND YOU KISS EVERYONE.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.400
NO ONE THOUGHT YOU WERE
  ACTUALLY GONNA BRING HIM.

16:42.400 --> 16:43.300
WELL, HE WANTED TO COME.

16:43.300 --> 16:46.700
 WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED
  TO DO, SAY NO?
  I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.

16:46.700 --> 16:50.300
 I WILL TRY
TO BMORE PLEASANT.

16:50.300 --> 16:51.200
THANK YOU.

16:51.800 --> 16:53.700
  BUT I'M CONFUSED.
  I'M ANGRY AT HIM.

16:53.700 --> 16:55.400
YEAH, YOU THINK I'M NOT?

16:55.400 --> 17:00.300
JUST PLEASE DON'T THROW
ANY MORE FUEL ON THE FIRE.

17:01.500 --> 17:02.400
  ALL RIGHT.

17:04.099 --> 17:05.300
 I'M SORRY. I...

17:06.400 --> 17:07.900
  I PROBABLY
 SHOULDN'T SAY THIS,

17:07.900 --> 17:09.300
  BUT I KNOW WHAT
  YOU'RE GOING THROUGH,

17:09.300 --> 17:10.200
 LET ME PUT IT THAT WAY,

17:10.200 --> 17:12.200
  AND I WORRY THAT IF A MAN
DOES THIS ONCE,

17:12.200 --> 17:13.599
  HE'S GOING TO DO IT AGAIN.

17:13.599 --> 17:16.200
YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU SHOULD NOT BE SAYING THIS.

17:16.700 --> 17:18.599
SARAH, I CARE ABOUT YOU.

17:20.300 --> 17:22.599
LOOK, MOM, I APPRECIATE
  YOUR POINT OF VIEW,

17:23.700 --> 17:25.300

  WASN'T PERFECT,

17:28.200 --> 17:31.200

17:37.400 --> 17:40.800
I EW UP FEELING LIKE
I WAS PART OF SOMETHING WHOLE,

17:42.400 --> 17:45.000
AND THAT'S ALL I WANTED
  TO GIVE MY KIDS.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.700
  OH, SARAH.

17:50.200 --> 17:51.900

17:53.800 --> 17:55.500

  A QUITTER, SWEETHEART.

17:55.500 --> 17:56.400
I WASN'T EITHER.

17:56.400 --> 17:59.500
  MAYBE THAT'S WHY
  I NEVER LET MYSELF SEE WHAT WAS REALLY HAPPENING.

17:59.500 --> 18:02.800
 I STOOD BY YOUR FATHER
BLINDLY, NO MATTER WHAT.

18:03.600 --> 18:05.900

THE SAME MISTAMES I DID.

18:05.900 --> 18:07.400

CAN EVER TRUST JOE AGAIN OR NOT,

18:53.300 --> 18:55.600
 WITH GLASSES
AND A CARDIGAN SWEATER?

18:56.100 --> 18:58.300
  IT'S A LITTLE WARM
FOR A SWEATER, ISN'T IT?

19:01.200 --> 19:03.500
  EXCUSE ME. I DON'T MEAN
  TO INTERRUPT, MARK. I'M SORRY.

19:03.500 --> 19:05.300
  HOLLY, THE VINTNER
  WANTS TO SEE YOU.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.200
WELL, IT WASOVELY
TO MEET YOU, MARK.

19:08.500 --> 19:09.700
MAYBE I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

19:12.300 --> 19:13.300
  WHAT THE HELL
  ARE YOU DOING?

19:13.400 --> 19:16.300
I AM TRYING TO HOST A PARTY,
 IF YOU DON'T MIND.

19:16.600 --> 19:18.200
OH, COME ON, HOLLY,
  THAT'S A LOT OF CRAP.

19:18.300 --> 19:21.600
  YOU'RE TRYING TO SCREW
  WITH MY SISTER.  I'M WARNING YOU, I WANT YOU
TO DROP IT RIGHT NOW.

19:21.600 --> 19:22.900
OH, I SEE.

19:23.000 --> 19:26.400
TIME TO STAND UP FOR THE FAMILY
  AGAIN, IS IT, SAUL?

19:26.700 --> 19:29.300
DON'T WASTE YOUR ENERGY.
 THEY'RE JUST FRIENDS.

19:29.600 --> 19:32.800
SO IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I HAVE GUESTS TO ATTEND TO.

19:35.800 --> 19:36.500
  NO.

19:37.600 --> 19:38.700
 KITTY,
WHAT'S THE ROOM SITUATION?

19:38.700 --> 19:40.000
WHERE AM I PUTTING MY BAG?

19:40.400 --> 19:41.600
(slurring words)
 WHAT SITUATION?

19:41.600 --> 19:44.100
OH, WHOA. HOW'D YOU GET
 THIS DRUNK THIS FAST?

19:44.100 --> 19:48.100
LET ME KNOW YOUR SECRET.
MY TOE IS STUCK.

19:48.700 --> 19:51.300
  OH, WHOA. OKAY,
YOU'RE CUT OFF, MISSY.

19:51.600 --> 19:52.500
HOW MUCH HAVE YOU HAD?

19:52.500 --> 19:55.100
I'VE HAD SIPS. SIPS!
  (groans)

19:57.400 --> 20:00.000
  WHY DO I ALWAYS HAVE
TO SCREW THINGS UP, KEN?

20:00.900 --> 20:02.200
IT'S <i>KEVIN,</i>

20:02.500 --> 20:03.800
AND WHAT HAVE YOU
 BEEN DRINKING?

20:04.200 --> 20:05.500
 OH, WOULD YOU STOP YELLING?

20:05.500 --> 20:07.200
 IT'S ALWAYS BLAH, BLAH--

20:07.200 --> 20:09.400
AND--AND THANKS FOR THE ASPEN.

20:09.400 --> 20:11.000
ASPEN?
  MY... (laughs)

20:11.800 --> 20:15.800
  NO, I HAD SUCH A BAD HEADACHE,
 AND NOW--
 <i>ASPIRIN?</i> WHAT ASPIRIN?

20:16.100 --> 20:17.200
  I DON'T KNOW.
 IT WAS ASPIRIN.

20:17.200 --> 20:19.700
  IT WAS IN YOUR LITTLE
 KIT--KIT--KITTY THINGY.

20:19.900 --> 20:20.900
IN MY DOP KIT?

20:23.800 --> 20:26.400
 HOW MANY DID YOU TAKE?
 <i>HOW MANY DID YOU TAKE?</i>
NO, THAT WAS IT.

20:26.400 --> 20:29.800
HOW MANY DID YOU TAKE?
 I TOOK--I TOOK THREE
 BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY BAD.

20:29.800 --> 20:31.000
  DO YOU KNOW--
OKAY, THESE--

20:31.000 --> 20:35.600
WAIT, SHUSH!
 ROBERT IS SO MAD AT ME.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
KITTY, THESE AREN'T ASPIRIN.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.200
THEY'RE PRESCRIPTION PAINKILRS
 FROM WHEN I THREW MY BACK OUT.

20:40.200 --> 20:42.200
  OH, WELL, THEN WHAT ARE THEY
 DOING PRETENDING TO BE ASPIRIN

20:42.200 --> 20:43.600
  BECAUSE I DON'T
HAVE CHILDREN, OKAY?

20:43.600 --> 20:45.500
I DIDN'T THINK I'D HAVE TO
  CHILDPROOF MY DOP KIT.

20:45.600 --> 20:47.200
NOW YOU NEED TO LIE DOWN
 AND DRINK SOME WATER.

20:47.200 --> 20:49.300
YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.
 IT'S NOT MY FAULT
  THAT YOU DON'T HAVE CHILDREN.

20:49.300 --> 20:52.200
KITTY--
NOW STOP IT. NOW YOU RELAX.
  YOU SHOULD JUST LET ME SUFFER

20:52.200 --> 20:54.700
  BECAUSE I'M A HORRIBLE PERN.
COME ON, LET'S G

20:54.700 --> 20:57.800
 NO. HOW MANY PEOPLE
 DO YOU KNOW ASK SOMEBODY TO MARRY THEM

20:57.800 --> 21:00.000
AND THEN TAKE IT BACK?

21:00.400 --> 21:02.900
WHAT? WHO--WHO ASKED
 WHO TO MARRY THEM?

21:03.100 --> 21:03.900
  WHAT?
NO, WHO?

21:03.900 --> 21:04.900
 YEAH.
WHO ASD WHO TO MARRY THEM?

21:04.900 --> 21:07.700
WHO?
 WHO ASKED WHO TO MARRY THEM?

21:08.200 --> 21:12.100
  TO--ROBERT. ROBERT. DUMB.

21:12.300 --> 21:15.400
 I ASKED ROBERT TO MARRY ME,
 AND HE WOULD HAVE SAID YES,

21:15.400 --> 21:18.500
  EXCEPT THAT HE'S IN D.C.,
 ANI'M HERE.

21:19.600 --> 21:22.100
  OH, OH, WELL, YOU BETTER--
  YOU BETTER SHUSH. SHUSH!

21:22.100 --> 21:24.400
  SHUSH! BECAUSE IT'S A <i>SEEKIT.</i>

21:24.400 --> 21:28.700
  CAN'T TELL ANYBODY,
 KEVIN--KEVIN, ESPECIALLY SARAH.

21:28.700 --> 21:33.100
YOU--AW. NO, SERIOUSLY,
  WHEN IOOK AT YOU SOMETIMES,

21:33.100 --> 21:34.200
I REMEMBER WHEN I USED TO...

21:34.200 --> 21:36.200
CHANGE YOUR DIAPERS.
KITTY. KITTY.

21:36.200 --> 21:37.200
  YOU WERE SUCH A BABY.
  KITTY.

21:37.200 --> 21:40.500
 WHAT?
  ARE YOU GONNA
MARRY McCALLISTER?

21:40.800 --> 21:42.500
(slurring words)
 YOU KNOW WHAT I NEED TO DO?
WHAT?

21:42.500 --> 21:44.800
I NEED TO PUT MY HEAD DOWN.

21:44.800 --> 21:45.800
KITTY. KITTY!

21:45.800 --> 21:47.300
ALL RIT,
  JUST GIVE ME A SECOND.

21:47.300 --> 21:49.400
KITTY!
 I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
 I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

21:51.100 --> 21:51.800
(man) ...THE WHOLE TRIP!
  (laughter)

21:51.800 --> 21:52.600
 HOW'S IT GOING?

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
 MAN, ARE WE EVER GONNA HAVE
A CIVIL CONVERSATION?

21:57.000 --> 21:59.200
I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY TO YOU.
  HEY, GET OFF ME!

22:00.000 --> 22:03.300
  I TOLD YOU I'M SORRY.
I'M SICK TO DEATH ABOUT IT.
  LOOK, I AM N GONNA SIT HERE

22:03.300 --> 22:04.900
  AND PRETEND NOTHING HAPPENED,
 ALL RIGHT?

22:04.900 --> 22:06.600
  YOU CAME ON TO A GIRL
HALF YOUR AGE, DUDE,

22:06.600 --> 22:08.600
WHICH IS COMPLETELY PATHETIC
 CONSIDERING

22:08.600 --> 22:12.500
 SHE'S YOUR WIFE'S HALF SISTER.
 IT'S DISGUSTING, JOE.
  WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

22:12.600 --> 22:14.700
  NOTHING.
  LOOK, I GAVE YOU A CHANCE TO DO THE RIGHT THING,

22:14.700 --> 22:16.600
AND YOU DIDN'T.
  EXCUSE ME?

22:17.600 --> 22:20.300
SARAH, JUST LET IT GO.
 NO, JOE, I WON'T LET IT GO.

22:20.300 --> 22:22.500
LOOK, I KNEW ABOUT
 THE WHOLE THING, OKAY?

22:22.500 --> 22:25.400
REBECCA TOLD ME,
AND ALL I DID WAS ASK HIM TOE HONEST
 WITH YOU.

22:27.700 --> 22:29.200
THAT WAS NOT YOUR PLACE.

22:32.100 --> 22:35.000
LOOK, I WAS--I WAS CRAZY.
  I SHOULDN'T BE HERE.
  JOE, PLEASE DON'T.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.700
 NO. LOOK, I'M JUST
MAKING THINGS WORSE.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.600
 LOOK, THIS IS ABOUT TOMMY,
NOT ME. I'LL SEE YOU AT HOME.

22:39.600 --> 22:40.500
 OKAY. FINE.

22:44.000 --> 22:44.800
  YOU HAPPY NOW?

22:51.100 --> 22:52.100
  YOU KNOW,
  YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO TASTE IT

22:52.100 --> 22:55.400
 AND THEN POUR THE REST
  INTO THE SPITTOON.
 I KNOW, BUT THAT WOULD MEAN

22:55.400 --> 22:57.500
  OF REMAINING SOBER,
 AND TODAY THAT'S NOT AN OPTION.

22:57.700 --> 23:00.900
  OH, OKAY. WELL, ONE SHOULD
  NEVER DRINK ALONE.
 MM.

23:03.300 --> 23:05.000
SARAH, CAN I TALK TO YOU
  FOR A SECOND?

23:05.400 --> 23:08.300
 NOT UNLESS YOU WANT YOUR HEAD
  HANDED TO YOU ON A PLATTER.

23:10.300 --> 23:12.800
 NO, NO. NONE FOR HIM.
HE'S A FRIEND OF BILL'S.

23:12.800 --> 23:13.800
HE'S NO FRIEND OF MINE.

23:13.800 --> 23:16.100
  LOOK, WILL YOU JUST LISTEN
TO ME? I'M SORRY, OKAY?

23:16.100 --> 23:19.500
 I GOT CARRIED AWAY.
I WAS UPSET.
HE WAS JUST TRYING

23:19.500 --> 23:21.700
YOU KNOW, I CAN STAND UP
  FOR MYSELF, STIN.

23:22.300 --> 23:24.600
NOT IF WE KEEP THIS PACE.
NONE OF US WILL.

23:26.900 --> 23:28.300
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY!
  JUSTIN!

23:29.600 --> 23:31.000
IT'S GRAPE JUICE. RELAX.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.500
OH, GOD, THAT SCARED ME.
  FILL HER UP.

23:33.700 --> 23:36.500
  EXCUSE ME.
 CAN EVERYBODY HEAR ME?
  (guests) YEA YES.

23:37.500 --> 23:40.700
GOOD. WELL, HOLLY AND I WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME
 EVERYBODY HERE TODAY.

23:40.700 --> 23:43.100
  FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVEN'T
 SEEN MY WIFE JULIA, WE'RE, UH,

23:43.100 --> 23:44.500
 WE'RE EXPECTING TWINS.
  (cheering)

23:47.100 --> 23:47.900
  THANK YOU.

23:47.900 --> 23:50.200
 AND THE THING
  ABOUT BECOMING A FATHER...

23:51.700 --> 23:53.800
 IS IT MAKES YOU THINK
  ABOUT YOUR OWN DAD.

23:54.600 --> 23:56.100
  OUR FATHER WASN'T PERFECT.

23:56.100 --> 23:58.100
 MAYBE IT CAME
  WITH THE TERRITORY.

23:58.800 --> 23:59.500
 I DON'T KNOW.

24:00.400 --> 24:03.700
BUT BEFORE WE WERE BORN,
 HE PLANTED AN ORCHARD,

24:03.900 --> 24:06.400
JUST 200 TREES,
AND PRETTY SOON

24:06.400 --> 24:09.300
 IT TURNED INTO
THIS THRIVING BUSINESS.

24:09.900 --> 24:12.700
 WE'RE NAMING THE NEW VINEYARD
 WALKER LANDING

24:13.100 --> 24:15.600
BECAUSE IT'S HIS VISION
 THAT WE'RE CELEBRATING TODAY.

24:15.600 --> 24:19.600
  SO TO FATHERS AND CHILDREN

24:20.400 --> 24:22.200
 AND A GREAT NEW YEAR OF WINE.

24:22.200 --> 24:22.900
CHEERS.

24:22.900 --> 24:24.700
 CHEERS!
(Saul) MAZEL TOV.

24:24.700 --> 24:25.500
 NICE.

24:27.000 --> 24:27.800
WELL DONE.

24:28.600 --> 24:29.700
PUT YOUR NOSE IN IT.

24:31.500 --> 24:32.500
  WHAT DO YOU THINK?

24:35.800 --> 24:37.500
IT'S VERY DELICATE
 FOR A CABERNET.

24:37.700 --> 24:41.600
  CABERNET BLEND. WE LIKE
  TO MIX THINGS UP AROUND HERE.

24:41.800 --> 24:44.200
  PARDON ME. ACTUALLY,
  I DON'T MEAN TO DISAGREE,

24:44.200 --> 24:47.000
  BUT I DON'T THINK
 IT'S DELICATE AT ALL. I THINK IT'S HEAVY-HANDED.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.500
WELL, THEN WHY DON'T YOU TRY
THE WHITE WINE, SAUL?

24:49.500 --> 24:53.000
  YOU MIGHT FIND IT
  LESS THREATENING.
RED WINE DOESN'T

24:53.000 --> 24:54.600
  EXCEPT WHEN
 IT'S TANNIC AND PUSHY.

24:54.700 --> 24:56.600
  SAUL.
 WHAT?

24:57.700 --> 24:59.200
 WELL, PERHAPS
 I SHOULD REPHRASE IT.

24:59.700 --> 25:01.100
 I INK IT'S BAD WINE.

25:01.500 --> 25:03.400
 I THINK IT'S IMMATURE
  AND INAPPROPRIATE.

25:03.700 --> 25:05.900
  FUNNY, I FIND IT
  A BIT OVERBEARING.

25:06.100 --> 25:08.200
  WOULD YOU EXCUSE US A MOMENT?
  SURE.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.800
  WHY ARE YOU BEING
SO RUDE TO HIM?

25:11.800 --> 25:14.200
 NORA, I... I DON'T
LIKE HIM, THAT'S ALL.

25:14.200 --> 25:17.300
 YOU DON'T LIKE--
 GUYS, WOULD YOU ASK HIM TO STOP ACTING
  LIKE A DEN MOTHER?

25:17.300 --> 25:20.200
  OR--OR, YOU KNOW, WHO WANTS

25:20.200 --> 25:21.100
ME! PLEASE.
I WOULD.

25:21.100 --> 25:23.500
COULD WE HAVE MORE PINOT
  ALL AROUND, PLEASE?

25:23.500 --> 25:25.600
  THANK YOU.
  GUYS, STOP IT.
PULL IT TOGETHER.

25:25.600 --> 25:27.600
YOU'RE MAKING A SCENE.
I HAVE INVESTORS HERE.

25:27.700 --> 25:29.900
 GREAT SPEECH, DUDE.
 KILLED 'EM.
THANKS.

25:29.900 --> 25:33.200
LOOK, DINNER'S READY.
LET'S GO.

25:33.300 --> 25:34.300
 WAIT, WAIT.

25:34.600 --> 25:35.400
WHERE'S KITTY?

25:35.400 --> 25:38.900
MM, FORGET IT. SHE'S
  WHACKED OUT ON PAINKILLERS,

25:38.900 --> 25:41.300
DREAMING OF HER PENDING
NUPTIALS WITH McCALLIS--

25:41.400 --> 25:42.300
  HER WHAT?
  I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

25:42.300 --> 25:44.700
PENDING WHAT?
  WHAT WAS THAT?
 YOU KNOW, I'M HUNGRY.
WE SHOULD EAT. I'M STARVING.

25:44.700 --> 25:46.000
 (Justin) WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
  (Sarah) NO, NO, NO. YEAH.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.500
I DON'T KNOW WHY
  I SAY THESE THINGS.

25:47.500 --> 25:49.100
  IT'S LIKE I HAVE TOURETTE'S.

25:49.100 --> 25:50.200
(whimpers)
 THERE'S GONNA BE A WEDDING?

25:50.200 --> 25:52.600
OH, MY GOSH.N'T TELL ME
  THERE'S GONNA BE A WEDDING.

25:52.600 --> 25:55.100
  I'M SO EXCITED!
 THERE'S GONNA BE A WEDDING!
THAT'S JUST CHOICE, MOM.

25:55.200 --> 25:57.000
  YOU ARE DELIRIOUS OVER THE FACT

25:57.000 --> 25:59.500
 THAT KITTY'S GONNA MARRY A REPUBLICAN
 SHE'S KNOWN FOR THREE MONTHS,

25:59.500 --> 26:01.900
BUT YOU'RE PREPARED TO WRITE OFF
MY HUSBAND OF TEN YEARS.

26:01.900 --> 26:04.600
THAT'S JUST LOVELY.
  IT'SO LOVELY!
 SARAH, I--

26:04.600 --> 26:05.500
  NORA?
  YES?

26:05.500 --> 26:08.700
DINNER'S BEING SERVED.
  WOULD YOU LIKE TO JOIN ME?
UH, YOU KNOW,

26:08.700 --> 26:10.400
I'M RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE
OF SOMETHING RIGHT NOW.

26:10.400 --> 26:12.600
I'LL BE WITH YOU
  IN A MOMENT, OKAY?
 I'LL MEET YOU IN THERE.

26:12.600 --> 26:15.800
  OKAY, GOOD.
CAN WE JUST GO EAT, PLEASE?

26:16.100 --> 26:19.000
YOU GUYS GO, OKAY?
 I'M DRINKING MY DINNER.

26:19.200 --> 26:23.200
  SARAH, STOP. I THINK WE ALL
  NEED TO TALK <i>NOW.</i>

26:23.600 --> 26:25.800
THIS IS GREAT, JUST GREAT.

26:26.000 --> 26:29.400
WE THINK THIS CABERNET
  IS ROBUST AND FULL-BODIED,

26:30.000 --> 26:32.600
 BUT, OF COURSE, WE WANT
 THE VINEYARD TO DO THE TALKING.

26:33.200 --> 26:34.500
CAN THE VINEYARD
 WRITE A CHECK?

26:39.500 --> 26:42.700
  YOU OKAY, DEAR?
  YEAH,
  THEY'RE JUST KICKING.

26:42.800 --> 26:45.400
  IT'S THE GARLIC. REMEMBER
  WITH OUR FIRST, STANLEY?

26:45.400 --> 26:48.100
EVERYTHING HAD TO BE
  BLAND, BLAND, BLAND.

26:48.100 --> 26:49.800
 HOW YOU DOING DOWN THERE?

26:49.800 --> 26:51.800
I'M DOING GREAT. AND YOU?

26:52.000 --> 26:53.600
 THIS IS SILLY.

26:53.800 --> 26:56.600
 WHY AM I YELLING AT YOU
  OVER ALL THESE PEOPLE

26:56.600 --> 26:58.300
 AND THESE EMPTY CHAIRS?

26:59.000 --> 26:59.900
DO YOU MIND?

26:59.900 --> 27:01.000
  PLEASE DO. 

27:01.300 --> 27:04.000
YOU KNOW,
I'M FINE WITH EATING SOLO,

27:04.400 --> 27:08.400
BUT I WAS STARTING
TO GET FLASHBACKS OF MY HIGH SCHOOL
CAFETERIA YEARS.

27:09.400 --> 27:12.700
 SOMEHOW I DOUBT
  YOU EVER LACKED A LUNCH DATE.

27:13.600 --> 27:17.000
DO YOU KNOW THAT I HAVE BEEN
DYING TO TAKE A WALK ALL DAY?

27:17.300 --> 27:20.500
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL
 ABOUT GIVING ME A TOUR OF THE VINEYARD?

27:22.000 --> 27:23.800
 I DON'T KNOW
  WHAT I FEEL ABOUT IT.

27:24.100 --> 27:28.100
I MEAN, I CERTAINLY
  WOULDN'T WANT TO LEAVE ANY POTENTIAL INVESTORS.

27:30.300 --> 27:33.200
  THEY'RE SO BLOTTO,
THEY'LL NEVER KNOW YR 'VE GONE.

27:35.600 --> 27:38.000
  I KNOW THAT YOU'RE
ANGRY WITH MY HUSBAND.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.800
  I THINK "ANGRY"
  IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT.

27:39.800 --> 27:42.400
  WELL, I HAVE TO SAY,SARAH, IN OUR DEFENSE,
  WE DO FEEL BETRAYED.

27:42.500 --> 27:45.100
BUT THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU, SAUL,
OR ANY OF YOU.

27:45.500 --> 27:47.300
W-WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO,
 SARAH?

27:48.500 --> 27:50.300
  I MEAN, THAT--THAT'S--
  THAT'S THE QUESTION.

27:51.200 --> 27:52.500
I DON'T KNOW, JUSTIN.

27:53.500 --> 27:57.000
  NOW IS THAT SO HARD
FOR YOU ALL TO UNDERSTAND?

27:58.500 --> 28:02.500
NOW I KNOW THAT YOU ALL
  THINK YOU'RE DOING THIS NOBLE THING,

28:02.600 --> 28:03.500
 PUNISHING HIM,

28:03.500 --> 28:05.300
 BUT I HAVE
TO SORT ALL THIS OUT,

28:05.300 --> 28:07.700
AND ALL I CAN HEAR
ARE <i>YOUR</i> VOICES IN MY HEAD.

28:07.700 --> 28:10.900
SOLEASE JUST EXERCISE
  SOME SELF-CONTROL.

28:11.200 --> 28:14.100
LIKE--LIKE KEVIN WITH KITTY
 AND McCALLISTER.
 AW, NO, NO, NO.

28:14.100 --> 28:15.800
  COME ON, THAT'S--
  THAT'S TOTALLY DIFFERENT.

28:15.800 --> 28:17.400
 YOU KNOW, McCALLISTER'S
 A PUBLIC FIGURE.

28:17.400 --> 28:20.500
  THEY'RE--THEY'RE THERE
 TO BE DUMPED ON.
YEAH, BUT HE'S GONNA

 YEAH, YOU KNOW, WHICH NO ONE IS
  SUPPOSED TO KNOW ABOUT, OKAY?

28:23.500 --> 28:26.900
ESPECIALLY YOU.
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN,
  ESPECIALLY ME?

28:31.300 --> 28:32.700
WAIT, YOU GUYS DON'T THINK

28:32.700 --> 28:35.800
I'VE GOT THE STRENGTH TO HANDLE
  GOOD NEWS ABOUT A SIBLING?

28:35.800 --> 28:37.600
  COME ON, LET'S NOT GENERALIZE.
 IT WAS JUST KITTY, OKAY?

28:37.600 --> 28:40.400
OH, GOD. WHERE ARE
THE BOUNDARIES IN THIS FAMILY?

28:40.700 --> 28:42.600
 LISTEN, I CAN LIVE
WITH YOUR GOOD NEWS,

28:42.600 --> 28:46.500
 BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO LIVE WITH MY BAD NEWS OR LEARN TO SHUT UP!
  OKAY?

28:46.500 --> 28:48.900
OKAY. OKAY, SARAH. WE WILL.
 I CAN PUT UP
  WITH YOUR BAD NEWS.

28:48.900 --> 28:51.300

THIS IS THE KIND OF NIGHT
 THAT POETS DREAM ABOUT.

29:04.800 --> 29:08.800
HE ONLY REASON FOR BEING ALIVE
 IS BEING FULLY ALIVE."

29:08.900 --> 29:11.000
 HMM.
D.H. LAWRENCE SAID THAT.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.900
  I COULDN'T AGREE MORE.

29:12.900 --> 29:15.700
 I COULD STAY OUT HERE FOREVER.

29:15.700 --> 29:17.300
 WHOA! OH!
WHOOP.

29:17.700 --> 29:19.300
  THANK YOU, MISTER.

29:19.700 --> 29:21.100
MY PLEASURE, MADAM.

29:22.400 --> 29:24.900
  "YOU CAME TO ME
ON A SUMMER'S NIGHT,

29:25.400 --> 29:28.900
"AND FROM YOUR BEAM,
 YOU MADE MY DREAM.

29:30.100 --> 29:33.400
"'CAUSE WE LOVE YOU,
  MR. MOONLIGHT."

29:34.200 --> 29:37.400
 OH. WAS THAT

29:38.100 --> 29:39.600
IT'S THE BEATLES.

29:41.500 --> 29:44.100
 (Death Cab for Cutie)
  * SPECTRUM'S "A" TO "Z" *

29:45.900 --> 29:47.400
 * OH *

29:49.500 --> 29:51.800
 * OH *

29:53.400 --> 29:56.500
 WHY DON'T WE
  JUST KEEP WALKING?

29:58.800 --> 30:00.200
  (laughing)
  HEY, SORRY WE'RE LATE.

30:00.200 --> 30:02.700
  WE HAD TO ATTEND TO A LITTLE,
UH, FAMILY BUSINESS.

30:03.600 --> 30:04.600
  WHERE'S HOLLY?

30:04.700 --> 30:06.900
I THINK SHE TOOK A WALK.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.300
OH, YEAH, SHE WANTED TO SH
 THE PROFESSOR HER GRAPES.

30:26.900 --> 30:28.100
  I NEED MY BAG.

30:28.400 --> 30:29.400
WHERE'VE YOU BEEN?

30:30.700 --> 30:31.700
WENT FOR A WALK.

30:31.700 --> 30:34.200
WITH HOLLY, ALL THIS TIME?
 YEAH.

30:35.200 --> 30:37.100
OH, I FEEL LIKE
  I WENT TO THE PROM,

30:37.100 --> 30:39.200
AND MY DATE DITCHED ME
  FOR ANOTHER GIRL.

30:39.200 --> 30:40.300
  TO BE FAIR, NORA,

30:40.300 --> 30:43.600
  YOUR INTERPRETATION OF "DATE"
IS A LITTLE STRANGE.

30:43.600 --> 30:45.100
YOU BASICALLY
 IGNORED ME ALL DAY.

30:45.100 --> 30:47.600
  I DIDN'T IGNORE YOU. I WAS
DEALING WITH A FAMILY SITUATION.

30:47.600 --> 30:49.500
  I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE
THINGS STOOD BETWEEN US.

30:49.500 --> 30:50.900
 YOU GIVE MIXED SIGNALS.

30:50.900 --> 30:53.900
MIXED SIGNALS? I INVITED YOU
  AWAY FOR THE WEEKEND.

30:53.900 --> 30:57.700
  EVERYONE KNOWS WHAT
THAT MEANS--"THE WEEKEND."

30:58.200 --> 31:00.100
AND EVEN IF IT WASN'T
 HAPPENING FOR YOU,

31:00.100 --> 31:02.500
EVEN IF SOMETHING SWITCHED OFF
IN YOU BETWEEN L.A. AND HERE,

31:02.500 --> 31:04.400
  DID YOU HAVE
TO GO OFF WITH <i>HER?</i>

31:05.400 --> 31:06.800
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?

31:10.300 --> 31:12.300
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?

31:13.300 --> 31:15.000
* SLIPPING THROUGH THE BARS... *

31:15.000 --> 31:16.100
  WE KISSED.

31:17.100 --> 31:18.500
I'M SORRY, NORA.

31:18.500 --> 31:21.500
IT WAS--IT WAS
  A SPONTANEOUS CONNECTION.

31:21.500 --> 31:23.800
A SPONTANEOUS CONNECTION.
  (chuckles)

31:25.200 --> 31:27.400
  IS THAT WHAT
YOU THINK THAT WAS?

31:32.000 --> 31:32.900
 WELL, THAT SUCKED.

31:32.900 --> 31:34.700
  NO, IT DIDN'T, TOMMY.
  COME ON.

31:34.700 --> 31:36.600
DUDE, I'M SORRY, MAN. I FEEL
  LIKE I STARTED ALL THIS.

31:36.600 --> 31:38.700
I JUST COULDN'T HELP IT.
  I MEAN, IF YOU'RE NOT HAPPY WITH YOUR LIFE,

31:38.700 --> 31:39.800
 YOU DO SOMETHING
ABOUT IT, RIGHT?

31:39.800 --> 31:42.100
  Y-YOU GET A JOB. YOU DON'T
 CHEAT ON OUR FREAKIN' SISTER.

31:42.100 --> 31:45.600
WHOA. IT'S OVER, OKAY?
JUST DRINK YOUR JUICE.
  I GET IT.

31:45.600 --> 31:48.200
 I MEAN, IT KIND OF FEELS LIKE
  NOW THAT DAD'S NOT AROUND,

31:48.200 --> 31:51.600
 IT'S OUR PLACE TO DO THE WHOLE
MALE PROTECTIVE THING, YOU KNOW?

31:51.600 --> 31:53.300
DAD WOULD'VE BEEN REALLY PROUD

31:53.300 --> 31:55.400
 (Justin) YEAH.
 THANKS, MAN.  OH, ABSOLUTELY.
  LOOK AT US.

31:55.400 --> 31:58.900
WE'RE DRINKING A VERY DECENT
  WALKER LANDING PINOT...
 MM-HMM.

31:59.100 --> 32:00.199
 ALL BECAUSE OF YOU.
 (Kevin) YEAH.

32:00.200 --> 32:02.500
 I DON'T KNOW WHY
 I'M SURPRISED. (laughs)
WHAT?

32:03.900 --> 32:06.800
  WHAT?
 YOU REMEMBER
 THE LEMONADE STAND?

32:07.600 --> 32:09.000
(laughs)
YEAH, YOU RAKED IT IN.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.500
 DO YOU REMEMBER THAT?
  YEAH, HE RAKED IT IN
  BECAUSE YOU BOTH GAVE UP.

32:11.500 --> 32:14.000
 YOU DRANK ALL OF YOUR LEMONADE.
  HE WAS OUT TRE FOR HOURS.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.300
YOU KNEW EXACTLY WHAT
THE HIGH TRAFFIC HOURS WERE.

32:16.300 --> 32:18.500
  YOU KNEW WHERE TO PUT
THE LEMONADE STAND.

32:18.600 --> 32:21.200
YOU WERE ALREADY
A C.E.O., TOMMY.
  YOU DID GOOD, BRO.

32:21.200 --> 32:23.000
YEAH.
 THANKS, MAN.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.100

  TO WALKER LANDING. CHEERS.

32:25.100 --> 32:26.400
CHEERS. CHEE. <i>SALUD.</i>

32:27.300 --> 32:28.800
  THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

32:28.800 --> 32:30.600
 IT WAS GREAT.
 REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

32:39.500 --> 32:42.300
YOU CERTAINLY GOT YOUR MONEY'S
  WORTH TONIGHT, DIDN'T YOU?

32:42.300 --> 32:43.000
  EXCUSE ME?

32:43.000 --> 32:46.000
IT SEEMS YOU MANAGED TO HAVE
 QUITE A GOOD TIME,

32:46.000 --> 32:47.300
EVERYTHING TOLD.

32:47.400 --> 32:48.700
  WELL,
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY--

32:48.700 --> 32:50.300
IF A HOSTESS
CAN'T ENJOY HERSELF,

32:50.300 --> 32:52.100
  WHAT'S THE POINT
OF THROWING A PARTY?

32:52.300 --> 32:53.800
MY GOD, YOU'RE SMUG.

32:54.300 --> 32:56.700
  I THINK THAT'S THE THING
I DISLIKE ABOUT YOU THE MOST.

32:56.700 --> 32:59.700
  I AM SO SICK OF YOUR
  SELF-RIGHTEOUSNESS, NORA.

32:59.700 --> 33:02.800
 I DON'T EVEN LISTEN
  TO YOU ANYMORE.
OH, LOOK AT YOU.

33:02.900 --> 33:05.800
 OH, LOOK AT YOU. YOU'RE SO
PROUD OF YOURSELF, AREN'T YOU?

33:06.000 --> 33:07.700
MAKING OUT IN A VINEYARD.

33:07.700 --> 33:09.500
  THERE WAS NOTHING
TO BE PROUD OF.

33:09.500 --> 33:13.500
 IT WAS JUST A KISS.
THESE THINGS HAPPEN.

33:13.500 --> 33:14.900
 JUST ASK SARAH.

33:15.800 --> 33:18.500
 DON'T YOU DARE BRING
MY DAUGHTER INTO THIS.

33:18.600 --> 33:22.100
 YOU KNOW, AT LEAST THE TWO
  OF US WERE CONSENTING ADULTS.

33:22.100 --> 33:25.900
 ONE MORE WORD,
AND I WILL RIP THE TONGUE RIGHT OUT OF YOUR MOUTH!

33:25.900 --> 33:29.200
 WHEN I THINK OF WHAT YOU'VE
DONE TO HER, IT MAKES ME SICK!

33:29.200 --> 33:31.700
 WHAT <i>I'VE</i> DONE TO <i>HER?</i>
YES!

33:31.700 --> 33:34.300
GUYS! WHAT--ARE YOU OKAY?

33:34.300 --> 33:36.500
YES, YES, FINE.
 WE JUST NEED A LITTLE PRIVACY.

33:36.600 --> 33:37.800
 YEAH, WELL,
  COULD YOU KEEP IT DOWN?

33:37.800 --> 33:39.700
THERE'S INVESTORS
 OUT THERE, MOM.
  AH.

33:39.700 --> 33:42.500
 SAUL, WOULD YOU
 CLOSE THE DOOR, PLEASE?
  (Justin) CLOSE THE DOOR.

33:45.300 --> 33:46.900
I FORGOT ABOUT THAT CHAPTER,

33:46.900 --> 33:49.700
WHEN YOU HAD YOUR PAWS
 ALL OVER MY BROTHER.

33:50.000 --> 33:54.000
YOU SEEM TO BE OBSESSED
WITH THE MEN IN MY LIFE.

33:54.300 --> 33:57.700
  YOU CAN'T GET OVER THE FACT THAT WILLIAM TREATED YOU
 LIKE A HOOKER.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.600
  HE PAID YOU OFF WITH A HOUSE,

33:59.600 --> 34:02.800
WHEREAS HE LOVED ME AND MINE LIKE FAMILY.
FAMILY?

34:02.800 --> 34:05.200
  YES.
YOUR FAMILY IS INSANE.

34:05.400 --> 34:08.199
WHY DO YOU THINK HE ALWAYS
WANTED TO COME TO MY PLACE?

34:08.400 --> 34:11.300
HE WAS STIFLED BY YOU, NORA,

34:11.600 --> 34:14.400
BORED OUT OF HIS MIND!

34:14.699 --> 34:17.500
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN
THE SMILE ON HIS FACE

34:17.500 --> 34:19.500
WHEN HE CAME THROUGH MY DOOR.

34:19.500 --> 34:22.500
 WHY DID HE ALWAYS
  COME HOME TO ME THEN?

34:22.699 --> 34:26.400
  EVEN YOUR OWN DAUGHTER
 WOULD RATHER SLEEP AT MY HOUSE.

34:26.400 --> 34:28.300
YES, BECAUSE YOU'VE
POISONED HER MIND,

34:28.300 --> 34:32.199
YOU AND YOUR WHOLE FAMILY!
OH, NO. SHE HAD NOTHING
  BUT DISDAIN FOR YOU

34:32.199 --> 34:33.900
 FROMHE MOMENT WE MET HER.

34:33.900 --> 34:35.100
  I DON'T WANT TO RUB IT IN,

34:35.100 --> 34:37.500
 BUT REBECCA BEGGED ME
  TO LET HER STAY.

34:37.500 --> 34:40.400
REBECCA IS NONE
  OF YOUR BUSINESS!

34:40.500 --> 34:42.800
 YOUR ONLY JOB WAS TO
  LET ME KNOW WHERE SHE S!

34:42.800 --> 34:46.300
I'D SOONER CALL SOCIAL SERVICES
THAN I'D SEND HER BACK TO YOU!

34:46.600 --> 34:48.800
GUYS, YOU'RE SCREAMING.
 OH!

34:48.800 --> 34:50.900
 ALL OF YOU, OUT! NOW!

34:55.000 --> 34:56.699
YOU ARE A CAR WRECK.

34:56.699 --> 34:59.500
  I'D FEEL SORRY FOR YOU
IF YOU WEREN'T SO VICIOUS.

34:59.500 --> 35:01.200
YOU SPENT YOUR ENTIRE LIFE

35:01.200 --> 35:03.200
  LIVING OFF
OF OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY!

35:03.300 --> 35:05.900
  EVERHING I HAVE,
I HAVE EARNED.

35:05.900 --> 35:09.100
YOU HAVE NOT WORKED A SINGLE DAY
  IN YOUR ENTIREIFE.

35:09.100 --> 35:12.600
  WHAT DO YOU HAVE
  TO SHOW FOR YOURSELF,

35:12.700 --> 35:14.800
  LITTLE MISS PASADENA,

35:15.300 --> 35:17.200
  A BOX FULL OF RECIPES?

35:21.600 --> 35:22.600
  OH, HOLLY?

35:26.900 --> 35:28.200
I CAN'T BELIEVE...

35:28.700 --> 35:30.200
YOU DID THAT!

35:30.200 --> 35:32.700
THIS DRESS IS COUTURE!

35:32.700 --> 35:35.900
  I'M SURE IT'S BEEN
STAINED BEFORE.

35:35.900 --> 35:39.200
(gasps) OH, YOU!
  OH! IS THAT
  ALL YOU'VE GOT, HUH?

35:39.200 --> 35:41.600
  OH, LETTUCE! LETTUCE!
THAT'S REALLY SCARY.
OH!

35:41.900 --> 35:44.100
 HOW VERY SCARY.

35:46.200 --> 35:47.200
OHH.

36:32.600 --> 36:35.100
YOU KNOW WHAT I MISS
  MOST ABOUT HIM?

36:39.000 --> 36:40.100
HIS HAIR.

36:43.700 --> 36:45.200
  HE HAD GREAT HAIR.

36:46.000 --> 36:46.900
(chuckles) YEAH.

36:50.700 --> 36:54.000
I LIVED APART FROM HIM
  SO MUCH...

36:56.500 --> 37:00.400
 THATOMETIMES
I THINK I'M JUST WAITING

37:00.900 --> 37:04.600
FOR HIM TO SNEAK AWAY
  FROM YOUR HOUSE AND COME AND SEE ME.

37:12.000 --> 37:12.800
HOLLY...

37:14.400 --> 37:17.200
I'M GONNA TELL YOU SOMETHING
  YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR.

37:19.600 --> 37:21.300
 YOU HAVE TO LET HIM GO.

37:23.800 --> 37:24.900
  I DID.

37:33.800 --> 37:36.600
CAN I SAY SOMETHING THAT
YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR?

37:37.900 --> 37:38.900
  YEAH.

37:40.700 --> 37:44.300
YOU DON'T WANT MY DAUGHTER
  LIVING IN YOUR HOUSE.

37:53.200 --> 37:54.400
  OH, GOD. WHERE AM I?

37:55.700 --> 37:56.500
 KEVIN?

37:58.400 --> 37:59.300
 KEVIN?

38:00.700 --> 38:01.400
(groans) WHAT TIME IS IT?

38:01.400 --> 38:02.500
 IT'S TIME TO GET UP AND GO,

38:02.500 --> 38:05.700
 AND LOOK, I'VE MADE YOU
  A LOVELY POT OF TEA.

38:05.800 --> 38:06.400

HOW LONG HAVE I BEEN SLEEPING?

38:13.100 --> 38:15.300

YESTERDAY AFTERNOON.

38:15.400 --> 38:17.900
 (gasps) OH, MY GOD. YOU'RE
KIDDING ME. ARE YOU SERIOUS?

38:19.000 --> 38:20.900
KEVIN, DID SOMEBODY
 SLIP ME A ROOFIE?

38:20.900 --> 38:23.600
 UH, YOU KINDA SLIPPED

38:23.600 --> 38:25.900

 APPARENTLY, YOU'RE ENGAGED.

38:45.900 --> 38:48.200

38:58.500 --> 39:00.500
  NO MATTER WHAT IS
GOING ON IN MY LIFE.

  KIND OF "THE."

39:59.800 --> 40:03.400
