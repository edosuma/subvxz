Can you take me to the baseball
card store after school?

09:26.450 --> 09:27.686
Nope. I'm sorry,
I don't have time.

09:27.770 --> 09:29.928
I have errands to run:
grocery store, bank,

09:30.013 --> 09:32.663
library, dry cleaning.
Sorry.

09:32.747 --> 09:34.498
Then, can you give me the money
for my two As?

09:34.582 --> 09:36.333
I want to feel it burning
in my pocket all day.

09:36.417 --> 09:38.538
Hey, Kev, come on,
baseball cards upstairs.

09:38.623 --> 09:40.406
Randall, you remember
I'm picking you up from school?

09:40.490 --> 09:41.505
‐ You got your stuff?
‐ Yeah.

09:41.589 --> 09:42.673
Okay, good. Wait in the car.

09:42.757 --> 09:44.466

09:52.767 --> 09:54.934
I go. I stay.

09:55.019 --> 09:56.604
What does it matter?

09:57.451 --> 09:59.869
I'm gonna go to the market
a little later today.

09:59.962 --> 10:02.256
Do you have any requests
for dinner?

10:02.628 --> 10:04.337
Three‐ cheese macaroni?

10:04.422 --> 10:06.138
You got it.

10:07.002 --> 10:09.428
‐ Hi.
‐ How about after school

10:09.513 --> 10:10.951
I come with you
on your errands,

10:11.035 --> 10:12.703
and then we can swing by
the card store afterwards?

10:12.787 --> 10:14.325
Fine.

10:14.455 --> 10:16.164
Okay, let's go.

10:42.942 --> 10:45.027
I miss that crackle

10:45.111 --> 10:47.905
on the record before the music.

10:47.989 --> 10:49.907
Joni...

10:49.991 --> 10:51.241
I would spend

10:51.325 --> 10:54.829
hours staring
at this album artwork.

10:55.830 --> 10:58.415
Reading all the sleeve notes.

10:58.499 --> 11:00.042
Okay, boomer.

11:00.126 --> 11:02.920
Ha, you can laugh at me
all you want,

11:03.004 --> 11:05.213
but my record collection...

11:05.297 --> 11:08.259
was my whole world.

11:09.677 --> 11:11.929
Kind of like you
and your baseball cards.

11:12.013 --> 11:14.222
‐ (laughs): Oh, okay.
‐ Mm‐ hmm.

11:14.306 --> 11:16.224
All right, no,
my‐ my baseball cards, that,

11:16.308 --> 11:18.060
that was, that was real,

11:18.144 --> 11:19.825
that was a collection, okay?

11:19.910 --> 11:22.068
There‐ there was strategy
involved, there was commerce.

11:22.152 --> 11:23.831
‐ I mean, the whole thing.
‐ Oh, I remember.

11:23.915 --> 11:25.786
‐ Yeah.
‐ Mm‐ hmm.

11:29.822 --> 11:31.698
(laughs)

11:31.782 --> 11:33.951
Did I ever tell you
the first time

11:34.035 --> 11:35.577
your father and I
came out to I. A.,

11:35.661 --> 11:37.621
we tried to find
Joni Mitchell's old house

11:37.705 --> 11:40.124
in, um, Laurel Canyon?

11:42.043 --> 11:45.128
I think we passed Mount Olympus.

11:45.376 --> 11:47.879
You sure the map's
not upside‐ down?

11:48.883 --> 11:51.134
(laughs) No.

11:51.218 --> 11:53.720
We got close, we even

11:53.804 --> 11:55.481
wandered around
Joni's neighborhood,

11:55.566 --> 11:58.083
but we never found the house,

11:58.168 --> 12:00.796
so... we gave up.

12:02.566 --> 12:04.400
Maybe we should
finish the job, you know?

12:04.648 --> 12:06.984
We'll find Joni Mitchell's
old house.

12:07.068 --> 12:08.151
How?

12:08.235 --> 12:09.611
‐ Hey, Siri?
‐ (phone chimes)

12:09.695 --> 12:11.571
Where's Joni Mitchell's
old house?

12:11.655 --> 12:13.657
‐ What are you doing?
‐ SIRI: Here's what I found on the Web.

12:13.741 --> 12:15.325
‐ Is that it? That her house?
‐ (gasps)

12:15.409 --> 12:17.481
‐ Oh, my goodness, yes!
‐ Yeah?

12:17.566 --> 12:19.579
Yes, that‐ that's the house.

12:19.663 --> 12:20.998
Well, uh, do you think
we have time, though,

12:21.082 --> 12:22.295
before your doctor's
appointment?

12:22.379 --> 12:24.583
Well, if we don't have time,
we're gonna make time.

12:24.668 --> 12:26.841
‐ Okay, Carpe Diem Rebecca.
‐ Yes.

12:26.926 --> 12:28.216
Here we go, all right.

12:32.051 --> 12:33.343
Hey, girl.

12:33.427 --> 12:34.929
Get over here.

12:36.097 --> 12:37.755
It's nice to see you.

12:41.052 --> 12:42.811
Isn't this place cute?

12:42.895 --> 12:44.787
I love coming here for brunch.

12:44.872 --> 12:46.773
It's hip but still normal...

12:46.857 --> 12:48.389
Okay, Madison, let's
just cut the preamble.

12:48.473 --> 12:50.818
Okay, let's just
get it over with.

12:50.903 --> 12:52.536
I screwed up.

12:52.754 --> 12:54.169
You are so important to me,

12:54.254 --> 12:56.005
and friends don't
do that to friends.

12:56.090 --> 12:57.442
Or their brothers.

12:57.527 --> 12:59.487
Honestly, I don't know
what I was thinking.

12:59.572 --> 13:01.327
Other than I have never
seen anyone so hot

13:01.412 --> 13:02.856
and so vulnerable
at the same time.

13:02.941 --> 13:04.184
My brain just shorted.

13:04.269 --> 13:05.688
I mean, I know he's
your brother, but...

13:05.772 --> 13:07.064
my God.

13:07.542 --> 13:08.817
I am so sorry.

13:08.902 --> 13:10.820
I am ashamed and embarrassed,

13:10.999 --> 13:13.084
and it'll never happen again.

13:15.302 --> 13:17.888
I really don't know what
to think about all of this.

13:17.972 --> 13:21.058
And it really couldn't have come
at a more terrible time.

13:21.142 --> 13:23.185
Is it that CrossFit bitch?

13:23.269 --> 13:24.352
I'll kill her.

13:24.436 --> 13:25.395
Is it Toby?

13:25.479 --> 13:26.563
I'll kill him.

13:26.647 --> 13:27.898
You just say the word,

13:27.982 --> 13:29.149
I will Kill Bill all of them

13:29.233 --> 13:31.902
and help you raise
that child myself.

13:31.986 --> 13:34.029
Talk to me, Kate.

13:34.113 --> 13:35.781
Please?

13:41.829 --> 13:44.247
So, how we doing this, Doc...
is it Good Will Hunting

13:44.331 --> 13:45.661
or The Sopranos?

13:45.746 --> 13:47.456
No, I'm just playing. I, um...

13:47.835 --> 13:50.879
I'm comfortable
speaking about my emotions.

13:50.963 --> 13:52.395
I'm an emotional man.

13:52.574 --> 13:53.950
No shame.

13:54.035 --> 13:55.077
Uh... (clears throat)

13:55.162 --> 13:57.075
before we start, let me just...

13:57.629 --> 14:00.036
...put this on silent.

14:01.661 --> 14:03.537
(exhales)

14:04.520 --> 14:07.187
My, uh, mom's got a doctor's
appointment today,

14:07.271 --> 14:10.607
but there's no need
for any distractions, right?

14:10.691 --> 14:12.025
Okay.

14:12.109 --> 14:13.735
All yours.

14:13.819 --> 14:15.278
Is she okay?

14:15.362 --> 14:17.113
Ah, she's fine.

14:17.197 --> 14:19.950
Um, early signs of dementia,

14:20.034 --> 14:21.284
but we're on top of it.

14:21.368 --> 14:22.701
Today's just
a follow‐ up appointment,

14:22.785 --> 14:26.705
but that's‐ that's
not why I'm here.

14:27.041 --> 14:29.376
So, why are you here?

14:32.200 --> 14:33.617
Um...

14:34.287 --> 14:36.831
I have anxiety.

14:37.009 --> 14:38.969
Suffer from, is that the...?

14:39.053 --> 14:41.013
Doesn't matter.

14:42.348 --> 14:45.528
Maybe once every decade
things get too...

14:45.613 --> 14:47.447
overwhelming.

14:47.939 --> 14:49.559
I'll have a panic attack.

14:49.644 --> 14:51.061
I'll be hospitalized.

14:51.146 --> 14:53.898
That's happened twice.

14:54.450 --> 14:57.320
My house was
recently broken into.

14:57.825 --> 15:01.492
My wife's worried about
history repeating itself.

15:03.327 --> 15:05.829
So, my‐ my daughter Tess...

15:05.913 --> 15:08.790
uh... I have three daughters.

15:08.874 --> 15:12.502
Anyway, Tess sees a therapist.

15:12.586 --> 15:15.255
(nearby hissing)

15:16.364 --> 15:18.466
Um... (clears throat)
it's really helped her.

15:18.997 --> 15:20.844
So, I think that's

15:20.928 --> 15:22.304
what I'm looking
to get out of this is

15:22.388 --> 15:24.395
coping mechanisms.

15:25.265 --> 15:27.475
Okay, well,
before we get to that,

15:27.559 --> 15:30.520
I'd like to know
a little more about you.

15:30.604 --> 15:32.314
I'm an open book...
where do you want to start?

15:32.398 --> 15:33.773
The beginning?

15:34.067 --> 15:35.739
So, I'm actually adopted.

15:35.824 --> 15:38.443
I was left at a fire station
the day I was born,

15:38.528 --> 15:39.988
and a fireman took me
to the hospital,

15:40.072 --> 15:42.236
- where he met my parents...
- I'm so sorry.

15:42.681 --> 15:46.327
(groans) Before we get
too far into the weeds here,

15:46.412 --> 15:49.372
full disclosure...
I do know who you are.

15:49.689 --> 15:53.673
I've actually heard that story
in one of your speeches.

15:54.111 --> 15:56.964
In many of your speeches,
actually.

16:01.435 --> 16:03.345
Oh, you know...

16:06.244 --> 16:07.828
...my speeches.

16:08.100 --> 16:10.519

16:19.190 --> 16:20.721
(groans) So unfair.

16:20.806 --> 16:24.142
Well, so is life.

16:24.445 --> 16:26.863
Look, you‐ you're making
Kate's favorite dinner

16:26.947 --> 16:28.111
because she got dumped.

16:28.196 --> 16:30.596
And you're returning
Randall's library books

16:30.681 --> 16:31.952
because he's a massive nerd.

16:32.036 --> 16:33.537
The least you could do
is give me

16:33.621 --> 16:35.322
five minutes
at the baseball card store.

16:35.407 --> 16:38.206
Uh, I didn't go to the grocery
store just for Kate.

16:38.291 --> 16:40.745
I also bought groceries,
including two chickens

16:40.830 --> 16:42.837
that I will cook
for the whole family.

16:42.978 --> 16:44.807

Fine. We will go
to the baseball card store.

17:04.068 --> 17:05.569
‐ Yes.
‐ Because I'm fun.

17:05.653 --> 17:07.237
‐ But five minutes only.
‐ Okay.

17:07.320 --> 17:08.696
Five minutes, Kevin,
you hear me?

17:08.781 --> 17:10.160
‐ Got it.
‐ Seriously. We have groceries,

17:10.243 --> 17:11.276

19:14.977 --> 19:17.339
You know, I can't help but feel

19:17.424 --> 19:19.431
like I'm throwing
off my back foot here.

19:19.516 --> 19:22.477
It's like you googled me.
Isn't that against the rules?

19:23.759 --> 19:24.954
I mean, I just find it weird

19:25.039 --> 19:26.502
that you waited
to bring that up.

19:26.587 --> 19:28.255
You knew...

19:30.388 --> 19:31.764
No, I'm sorry.

19:32.004 --> 19:33.143
(takes deep breath)
I'm sorry.

19:33.227 --> 19:36.563
I'm only gonna get out of it
what I put in, right?

19:37.218 --> 19:39.228
Not your fault.

19:39.509 --> 19:42.548
I'm a public figure...
I shouldn't have been surprised.

19:44.156 --> 19:46.199
Where were we?

19:46.885 --> 19:48.377
Family.

19:48.688 --> 19:51.649
(sighs):
Family. Sure. Of course.

19:51.905 --> 19:53.865
(nearby hissing)

19:56.261 --> 19:58.705
I just told him
it‐ it wasn't enough

19:59.073 --> 20:00.783
for him to want to be

20:00.875 --> 20:02.017
a good father.

20:02.102 --> 20:03.712
Just needs to be one.

20:04.412 --> 20:06.163
And now I don't even know
if he's being sincere

20:06.247 --> 20:07.932
or if he's just telling me
what I want to hear.

20:08.016 --> 20:09.934
Could it be both?

20:10.019 --> 20:13.677
I mean... trust me,
I will take whatever position

20:13.762 --> 20:15.180
you take right now.

20:15.389 --> 20:17.877
But is it possible he just took
what you said to heart?

20:19.424 --> 20:21.050
I don't know.

20:22.275 --> 20:24.580
Do you want to know
why I think I slept with Kevin?

20:24.665 --> 20:26.939
‐ Um, no. Mm‐ mm.
‐ It was nice to be

20:27.024 --> 20:29.369
with someone who actually knew
something about me.

20:29.533 --> 20:33.119
As opposed to...
Tinder dates or being set up.

20:33.477 --> 20:36.400
I mean, he has seen me
at the hospital with no makeup.

20:36.485 --> 20:40.238
And at your house not trying
to be perky or appealing.

20:40.713 --> 20:44.596
What you and Toby have,
what I dream of finding,

20:44.681 --> 20:46.349
is that intimacy.

20:47.002 --> 20:49.611
It's letting people see
the worst part of you without...

20:49.696 --> 20:51.615
being scared.

20:52.372 --> 20:56.033
And I am just
gonna say this and duck.

20:56.613 --> 20:59.722
But shouldn't Toby be able
to express his deepest fears

20:59.807 --> 21:01.127
without punishment?

21:01.469 --> 21:03.720
Isn't that what marriage is?

21:03.804 --> 21:04.979
Okay.

21:05.064 --> 21:07.393
When did you become
the counselor of relationships

21:07.478 --> 21:08.986
with Bachelor in Paradise?

21:09.135 --> 21:12.291
I listen to a lot
of relationship podcasts.

21:12.376 --> 21:14.461
I keep hoping
I'll need them someday.

21:14.748 --> 21:16.111
(Kate chuckles)

21:16.196 --> 21:17.823
So, are we good?

21:18.103 --> 21:20.021
(sighs)
Yes.

21:20.106 --> 21:21.773
But you're on probation.

21:21.858 --> 21:23.359
You love me.

21:23.723 --> 21:25.416
Most of the time.

21:25.501 --> 21:27.545
Can I just tell you one thing
your brother did to me?

21:27.629 --> 21:29.756
‐ No. ‐ I was literally
upside‐ down at one point.

21:29.841 --> 21:32.635
‐ Madison.
‐ Just use your imagination.

21:35.760 --> 21:38.918
Hey. You got
any '91s left, Carl?

21:39.003 --> 21:42.047
Ooh, not many.
What are you looking for, Kev?

21:42.131 --> 21:46.551
I need a '91 John Candelaria
to finish off last year's set.

21:46.635 --> 21:48.010
I got ten bucks to do it.

21:48.157 --> 21:51.889
Well, I've got
only 16 packs left,

21:51.974 --> 21:53.307
but I like your chances

21:53.392 --> 21:55.893
‐ of finding it. ‐ Great,
I'll take 'em. Thank you.

21:55.978 --> 21:57.896
Eight dollars and 40 cents.

21:59.072 --> 22:00.614
(Rebecca laughs)

22:00.791 --> 22:03.586
Right.

22:05.112 --> 22:07.156
(Rebecca sighs)

22:14.401 --> 22:16.403
No John Candlemalaria?

22:16.707 --> 22:18.393
No?

22:18.478 --> 22:20.104
(Rebecca sighs)

22:21.096 --> 22:22.963
Well, buck up, sweetheart.

22:23.047 --> 22:25.736
You have, what, 14 packs left?

22:28.719 --> 22:30.846
Here. Blow on this one...
for good luck.

22:30.931 --> 22:33.475
(laughs, blows)

22:36.894 --> 22:39.312
Oh, gosh, this gum is really
not very good.

22:39.396 --> 22:40.815
The flavor only lasts a minute.

22:40.900 --> 22:43.471
You got to replace it,
like, every 60 seconds.

22:47.404 --> 22:48.924
‐ I feel good about this one.
‐ Yeah?

22:49.009 --> 22:51.261
Yeah, yeah. Come on.

22:51.346 --> 22:52.763
‐ Cool.
‐ Hey!

22:52.848 --> 22:54.558
Batter, batter, batter, swing!

22:54.643 --> 22:56.353
Come on.
(rubbing hands together)

22:57.597 --> 23:00.933
Did you know that Graham Nash
wrote the song "Our House"

23:01.392 --> 23:02.976
about this house?

23:03.061 --> 23:04.002
‐ Oh, really?
‐ Mm‐ hmm.

23:04.087 --> 23:05.744
‐ Huh.
‐ One morning

23:05.829 --> 23:08.174
Joni and Graham went down
to the Valley

23:08.259 --> 23:10.011
to have breakfast at Art's Deli.

23:10.096 --> 23:13.894
And after breakfast they were
walking down Ventura Boulevard,

23:13.979 --> 23:15.705
and Joni spotted this vase

23:15.790 --> 23:17.833
in a store window
that she really liked.

23:17.918 --> 23:19.378
Mm‐ hmm.

23:19.648 --> 23:21.357
So they bought it.

23:21.441 --> 23:24.527
And they brought it back home,
and Graham suggested

23:24.611 --> 23:27.989
that Joni pick some flowers
for the vase

23:28.073 --> 23:30.072
while he built a fire.

'cause I am...
I'm right here with you.

24:53.124 --> 24:56.057
You've always had
that quality, Kevin.

24:57.435 --> 24:59.353
You make everything fun.

24:59.484 --> 25:02.534
Which I know you probably think
is a bad thing sometimes,

25:02.619 --> 25:03.835
and maybe people don't
take you seriously.

25:03.919 --> 25:05.502
You're ice cold.
Let me try. Let me try.

25:05.587 --> 25:07.004
Ready?
(exhales sharply)

25:07.443 --> 25:09.487
Okay. Okay.

25:12.552 --> 25:14.220
Nope.

25:16.116 --> 25:18.243
It's not it.

25:19.184 --> 25:20.854
What?

25:23.188 --> 25:26.858
Sometimes making people forget
about their worries,

25:26.942 --> 25:30.190
or what comes next...

25:30.619 --> 25:35.111
that's the most important thing
you can do for someone.

25:38.351 --> 25:41.204
LEIGH: So,
we've talked about your panic attacks

25:41.289 --> 25:44.876
and your relationship
with your two fathers.

25:44.960 --> 25:47.795
How is your relationship
with your mother?

25:47.879 --> 25:49.213
It's good.

25:49.297 --> 25:50.986
I love my mother.

25:52.574 --> 25:54.575
We're very close.
(laughs)

25:54.886 --> 25:57.167
If you sense me tensing up
right now,

25:57.252 --> 25:58.222
it's because of her illness,

25:58.306 --> 26:00.558
not because
of my relationship with her.

26:00.799 --> 26:03.185
Trust me when I say
I'm not here because of her.

26:03.269 --> 26:05.361
I'm here
because I have control issues.

26:05.569 --> 26:08.404
Is that your... self‐ diagnosis?

26:08.566 --> 26:10.799
I think it's kind of obvious.

26:12.303 --> 26:15.162
Like how you're trying
to control the conversation away

26:15.247 --> 26:17.666
from talking about your mom?

26:21.240 --> 26:23.284
Okay, Dr. Melfi.

26:24.129 --> 26:25.705
I get it.

26:26.167 --> 26:28.085
I get what you're doing here.

26:28.169 --> 26:29.424
(nearby hissing)

26:29.509 --> 26:32.463
I mean, is it broke
or something? What's the...?

26:32.688 --> 26:35.815
Do you want to talk about why
that's bothering you?

26:35.900 --> 26:38.652
(sighs heavily)

26:39.179 --> 26:42.572
But then I would have to admit
that it's bothering me.

26:43.122 --> 26:45.182
Ha, ha.

26:45.289 --> 26:48.333
Okay. All right.

26:48.418 --> 26:52.463
So... this is all part of it,
right?

26:52.944 --> 26:55.221
The waiting room, the painting?

26:55.321 --> 26:56.971
Is that how
your operation works?

26:57.056 --> 27:00.486

into having a breakdown?

27:00.571 --> 27:03.322

‐ Ah, apologies.

see me toss the first one out?

28:01.385 --> 28:03.803

the waffle iron is too hot,

it's not hot enough, or,

30:40.570 --> 30:42.284
There's tomorrow,
and I will be here,

30:42.369 --> 30:44.413
and we will do something else.

30:45.495 --> 30:47.073
I promise.

30:50.978 --> 30:54.064
It's not that I need
to be in control.

30:54.313 --> 30:55.980
My mother depends on me.

30:56.308 --> 30:57.887
I'm the only one
who can take care of her.

30:57.971 --> 30:59.472
It's been that way a long time.

30:59.704 --> 31:02.042
And, yes, before you drop Freud
on me, I get it.

31:02.127 --> 31:04.331
I have a very complicated
relationship with my mother.

31:04.489 --> 31:07.112
But if I'm not the one who's
taking care of her, who will?

31:07.328 --> 31:09.246
Her husband?
He's a nice guy,

31:09.331 --> 31:11.249
but he's been missing this thing
for months.

31:11.410 --> 31:13.120
My brother?
(laughs)

31:13.205 --> 31:14.998
Just you wait.
By the end of this session,

31:15.097 --> 31:18.121
I'll get a text saying that
he completely lost track of time

31:18.206 --> 31:19.559
and forgot about
the appointment, all the...

31:19.643 --> 31:21.019
(hissing nearby)

31:27.434 --> 31:30.020
She made me promise
not to tell anyone

31:30.105 --> 31:32.023
when she got diagnosed.

31:32.153 --> 31:33.403
Why?

31:33.488 --> 31:36.074
Because my brother
is a recovering addict.

31:36.259 --> 31:38.510
My sister has a kid
with special needs.

31:38.595 --> 31:40.555
They have enough on their plate.

31:40.640 --> 31:42.516
As if I don't.

31:42.601 --> 31:44.770
And if you think
this is new information to me,

31:44.960 --> 31:46.105
if you think I'm having

31:46.190 --> 31:48.024
some kind of revelation
right now, I'm not.

31:48.229 --> 31:51.065
Which is why
this is a waste of time.

31:51.383 --> 31:52.800
I know my faults.

31:52.940 --> 31:54.284
I know what triggers me.

31:54.369 --> 31:56.745
But I think my faults
are good faults,

31:56.830 --> 31:59.082
and I would rather have them
than to not have them.

31:59.362 --> 32:01.446
And I know you think
I'm spiraling right now.

32:01.585 --> 32:03.337
I've seen the shows.
I know the drill.

32:03.422 --> 32:05.506
But, hey, if it wasn't for me,

32:05.591 --> 32:08.720
this whole family
would have fallen apart.

32:11.026 --> 32:12.320
LEIGH:
Would they?

32:12.404 --> 32:13.800
You...

32:14.125 --> 32:16.543
"Would they?"

32:16.908 --> 32:19.089
You know, um...

32:20.534 --> 32:22.205
You don't get it,

32:22.289 --> 32:24.972
and I don't have time
to explain it.

32:25.328 --> 32:28.247
And, uh, due respect,

32:28.596 --> 32:31.682
how am I supposed to take
mental health advice

32:31.767 --> 32:35.636
from someone who doesn't
throw out magazines from 2017?

32:35.847 --> 32:40.081
From someone who doesn't
refill cups at the water cooler?

32:40.166 --> 32:43.294
‐ From someone who put...
‐ (hissing)

32:47.003 --> 32:48.648
It's not that hard, Doc.

32:48.755 --> 32:50.757
(hissing)

32:53.479 --> 32:56.058
Just turn it off
when you're done.

33:09.550 --> 33:11.704
‐ Hey there.
‐ Hey.

33:12.146 --> 33:15.430
‐ Sorry I missed dinner.
‐ (chuckles)

33:16.617 --> 33:18.055
Where, uh, where are the girls?

33:18.140 --> 33:21.227
Uh, Deja's upstairs,
FaceTiming with Malik.

33:21.312 --> 33:23.524
Tess and Annie
are doing their homework.

33:24.037 --> 33:25.955
Right on.

33:26.234 --> 33:29.028
(grunts)

33:34.349 --> 33:36.009
(sighs)

33:40.902 --> 33:42.626
I tried, babe.

33:46.432 --> 33:48.350
I just don't think it's for me.

33:49.305 --> 33:51.071
I...

33:51.156 --> 33:52.360
Well, not...

33:52.445 --> 33:53.658
At least not right now.

33:53.742 --> 33:55.660
I'm not closing the door on it.

33:56.344 --> 33:58.138
Okay.

33:59.626 --> 34:00.891
You good?

34:00.976 --> 34:03.145
Mm‐ hmm.

34:06.167 --> 34:08.476
I knew you'd find
something wrong with it.

34:08.610 --> 34:10.226
There's nothing wrong with it.

34:10.312 --> 34:11.929
‐ It's just, um...
‐ I think

34:12.014 --> 34:13.933
you should try
to give it a chance.

34:14.154 --> 34:16.563
Maybe you should just go
a couple more times,

34:16.648 --> 34:17.955
‐ and‐and then if you still.
‐ Thank you, Beth,

34:18.039 --> 34:19.415
- think that..
- But I'm okay.

34:19.991 --> 34:21.949
All right? And I know
you think I need this,

34:22.034 --> 34:24.036
‐ but...
‐ Babe?

34:24.362 --> 34:26.447
I need this.

34:27.675 --> 34:29.360
Sorry?

34:32.534 --> 34:33.806
You want to know
why I didn't let you

34:33.889 --> 34:35.735
go through my purse
this morning?

34:38.608 --> 34:39.900
Why?

34:55.018 --> 34:57.603
You bought Annie the iPhone.

34:57.992 --> 34:59.743
It's a bottle of pepper spray

35:00.643 --> 35:04.126
'cause sometimes I have to lock
up the studio alone at night.

35:04.264 --> 35:05.806
And that didn't used
to bother me,

35:05.891 --> 35:07.407
but now it does.

35:11.902 --> 35:13.977
This is doctor‐ prescribed.

35:15.249 --> 35:17.423
You know, I haven't been
sleeping very well.

35:18.499 --> 35:21.149
She gave me three pills
just to get me over the hump.

35:22.597 --> 35:23.743
And yeah.

35:23.885 --> 35:25.102
This is a phone for Annie,

35:25.187 --> 35:26.730
but it's not
because she wants it.

35:27.084 --> 35:29.002
It's because I want her
to have it

35:29.117 --> 35:32.411
because there was a strange man
in our house,

35:32.496 --> 35:35.415
and I need to know
where my baby is at all times.

35:35.500 --> 35:37.084
I'm sorry, Beth, I didn't know.

35:37.416 --> 35:39.334
Of course you didn't.

35:39.442 --> 35:41.360
'Cause I didn't tell you.

35:41.970 --> 35:43.430
Because I was worried

35:43.515 --> 35:45.976
that if I lay anything else
on you,

35:46.244 --> 35:48.071
you were gonna crack.

35:50.045 --> 35:52.129
But I want to tell you.

35:52.837 --> 35:54.407
I need to.

35:55.049 --> 35:56.852
You're my person.

35:57.813 --> 36:00.524
Unless you're gonna get
the help you need...

36:02.272 --> 36:04.118
...I can't.

36:10.522 --> 36:12.524
The MoCA test
ruled out impairment

36:12.609 --> 36:14.118
due to stroke or tumor.

36:14.203 --> 36:16.313
The brain MRI revealed

36:16.408 --> 36:18.910
hippocampal atrophy, which means

36:18.994 --> 36:21.579
shrinkage in the memory centers
of the brain.

36:21.663 --> 36:24.376
We're not making a diagnosis
based solely on the MRI,

36:24.461 --> 36:27.084
but hippocampal atrophy
would support a diagnosis

36:27.169 --> 36:29.087
of mild cognitive impairment,

36:29.171 --> 36:32.215
likely due to Alzheimer's,

36:32.555 --> 36:36.052
suggesting a clear course
of action for us.

36:36.425 --> 36:38.510
[♪ ♪]

36:48.071 --> 36:49.774
So, the truth is,

36:49.858 --> 36:53.111
I didn't clean out the garage
just for you.

36:53.195 --> 36:55.113
I cleaned it out for Jack, too.

36:55.197 --> 36:58.657
See, the music studio is for...

36:58.867 --> 37:00.952
the both of you.
(exhales)

37:01.102 --> 37:03.079
Ta‐ da.

37:03.163 --> 37:04.331
What?

37:06.708 --> 37:08.759
Obviously,
we will have to upgrade it

37:08.844 --> 37:11.993
as he grows, but if any kid
deserves a playroom

37:12.184 --> 37:14.895
with every sound known to man,

37:14.980 --> 37:17.315
it is Jumpin' Jack Damon.

37:20.407 --> 37:22.001
Toby, I love it.

37:22.087 --> 37:23.421
And you're right.

37:23.506 --> 37:25.591
This is the number one gesture.

37:26.368 --> 37:27.766
Thank you.

37:27.882 --> 37:29.466
‐ Told you.
‐ I know.

37:29.551 --> 37:30.844
(chuckles)

37:32.413 --> 37:34.938
Hey, I'm gonna make some tea,

37:35.023 --> 37:37.024
gather up the Swedish Fish
for movie night.

37:37.109 --> 37:38.610
I'm thinking Borat.

37:38.695 --> 37:40.113
Perfect.

37:43.317 --> 37:45.235
‐ Sweetheart?
‐ Yeah.

37:45.538 --> 37:48.555
I have a favor to ask of you,
and it's important.

37:48.710 --> 37:50.128
Yeah, anything.

37:50.610 --> 37:53.985
Please don't start treating me
any differently, okay?

37:54.070 --> 37:55.278
I need the fun.

37:55.363 --> 37:57.282
I need the laughs.

37:58.500 --> 38:01.048
I'm serious, Kevin.

38:02.115 --> 38:04.055
I need that part of you.

38:06.650 --> 38:07.901
Okay.

38:08.454 --> 38:10.021
I also really want to go

38:10.105 --> 38:11.814
to your movie premiere
in New York.

38:11.898 --> 38:13.858
I see Matt Damon
bringing his mom.

38:13.942 --> 38:15.776
That's different.

38:15.938 --> 38:17.290
