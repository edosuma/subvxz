      Afternoon, everyone.      

00:08.500 --> 00:11.000
Woody, may I have               
a beer, please?                 

00:11.000 --> 00:12.300
Oh, just a second,              
Dr. Crane.                      

00:12.400 --> 00:15.300
I'm finishing up this article   
in <i>Newsweek</i> on genetic coding.  

00:15.400 --> 00:16.700
Do you understand it, Woody?    

00:16.700 --> 00:19.000
No. Thank God                   
I'm almost finished.            

00:20.700 --> 00:22.100
                 It says here in
             <i>Scientific American</i>

00:22.200 --> 00:24.900
    they've isolated the gene   
          that causes arthritis.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.100
What have you got there, Sam?   

00:26.100 --> 00:27.800
    Ad for hair conditioner.    

00:29.700 --> 00:33.700
  It says it makes your scalp   
          all tingly.

    Oh, I'm, I'm glad to see    
that you're all making an effort

00:35.400 --> 00:37.300
  to keep yourselves informed.  
                        Yeah,

Sam, what's going on?           

03:01.500 --> 03:02.900
I was enjoying that.            

03:02.900 --> 03:04.800
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.           

03:04.800 --> 03:07.900
            Always leave them   
                wanting more.   

03:08.000 --> 03:09.100
 Guys, listen up for a second.  

03:09.200 --> 03:10.100
    Will you, please?           

03:10.200 --> 03:12.000
    Uh, when Rebecca comes in,  

03:12.100 --> 03:14.000
 she's, uh, probably not going  
    to be feeling too good,     

03:14.100 --> 03:16.000
  so just take it easy on her.  

03:16.100 --> 03:17.500
        All right?              

03:17.500 --> 03:19.300
    What's the problem, Sam?    

03:19.400 --> 03:21.100
            Well, she called off
              the whole wedding.

03:21.200 --> 03:22.600
Get out.                        

03:22.700 --> 03:24.300
SAM:                            
No, it's true.                  
I went over there last night.   

03:24.400 --> 03:25.700
                 I tell you, she
                was a real mess,

03:25.800 --> 03:27.800
            but she was clear   
                about one thing:

03:27.900 --> 03:29.300
                    she does not
                    love the guy

03:29.400 --> 03:31.200
              and there's no way
    she's going to marry him.   

03:31.200 --> 03:33.600
    Good morning, everyone!     

03:35.200 --> 03:36.000
             Jonathan, thank God
                    you're here.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.400
             I'm in such a rush.

03:37.400 --> 03:38.700
      Now, I don't have any time
              for those curlers,

03:38.800 --> 03:40.100
              so you're going to
        have to do your trick   

03:40.200 --> 03:41.600
            with the blow-dryer.

03:41.600 --> 03:45.000
                      Yeah, Sam,
                 she's in agony.

03:45.100 --> 03:48.100
Ordinarily, Sam, people         
don't deal with depression      

03:48.200 --> 03:51.000
 by putting on a wedding dress  
    and acting giddy.           

03:51.000 --> 03:52.800
      Except maybe Clavin.      

03:54.900 --> 03:58.100
      Men don't get giddy.      

03:58.200 --> 04:00.200
              Yeah, right, nice.

04:00.300 --> 04:01.400
         This is crazy.         

04:01.500 --> 04:03.100
      I got to go find out      
        what's happened.        

04:03.200 --> 04:04.700
Way back on my head             
or up forward like this,        

04:04.800 --> 04:06.300
whichever way we decide.        

04:06.400 --> 04:07.500
         Hi, Sam.               

04:07.500 --> 04:08.800
      What are you doing?       

04:08.900 --> 04:10.700
     I know, I know.            

04:10.800 --> 04:12.900
 I said that I would never have 
     a traditional wedding,     

04:13.000 --> 04:14.100
         but, you know,         
    deep down inside,           

04:14.200 --> 04:17.100
    doesn't every girl want     
    to get married in white?    

04:18.200 --> 04:20.899
What about all that stuff       
      you said last night?      

04:21.000 --> 04:22.800
          What stuff?           
 I wasn't even here last night. 

04:22.800 --> 04:23.900
             I know             
  you weren't here last night.  

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
  You were at your apartment.   
     I was there with you.      

04:26.000 --> 04:27.100
                    Remember?   
    Oh, don't be silly, Sam.    

04:27.200 --> 04:28.400
     I wouldn't let anybody     
    in that apartment.          

04:28.500 --> 04:30.200
        It's a mess.            

04:30.200 --> 04:33.400
Oh, my God, she doesn't...      
  you don't remember, do you?   

04:33.400 --> 04:35.300
                      Excuse us.
             We're working here.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.000
        Dear, I'll need         
an extension cord for the dryer.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.400
Oh, sure.                       
                Hey, yo, pal.   

04:38.500 --> 04:40.300
            Listen, I don't care
         what you're doing here.

04:40.400 --> 04:44.100
    Th-This happens to be the   
    most important thing that...

04:44.100 --> 04:46.500
            You use this gel?   

04:46.600 --> 04:47.800
                 I tried this.  

04:47.900 --> 04:49.600
                It just dries   
                    my hair out.

04:49.700 --> 04:51.900
Are you touching it during      
the critical drying stage?      

04:51.900 --> 04:53.800
            What do you think   
                 I am, a rookie?

04:56.600 --> 04:59.000
You guys,                       
I have my new wedding dress     

04:59.000 --> 05:00.600
and now all I need              
is something old,               

05:00.700 --> 05:02.800
something borrowed,             
and something blue.             

05:02.900 --> 05:04.600
    How about Norm's liver?     

05:06.900 --> 05:08.500
                     I <i>am</i> almost
            finished with it.   

05:08.600 --> 05:11.100
                    Uh, Rebecca,

05:11.200 --> 05:13.300
I'm probably way out            
of line here, but, uh...        

05:13.400 --> 05:15.100
              I want you to know
              what a great honor

05:15.100 --> 05:17.800
 it would be for me             
 to sing at your wedding.       

05:17.800 --> 05:19.500
             Okay.              

05:19.600 --> 05:22.400
                  Really? Cool! 

05:22.400 --> 05:24.200
Jonathan,                       
I found the extension cord.     

05:24.300 --> 05:25.800
      We'll have to finish      
    down at City Hall.          

05:25.800 --> 05:27.100
                            SAM:
                     Honey, now,
                  wait a minute.

05:27.100 --> 05:28.300
We were in your apartment       
        together.               

05:28.400 --> 05:30.200
      Don't you remember?       
    You came on to me.          

05:30.300 --> 05:31.700
      You said that you couldn't
            possibly marry Robin

05:31.800 --> 05:33.800
  because in your entire life   

05:33.800 --> 05:36.100
      you never had anyone      
    as exciting as me.          

05:36.100 --> 05:38.200
My! Someone's full              
of himself                      

05:38.200 --> 05:41.400
on my wedding day.              

05:41.400 --> 05:42.800
              Well, Sam, don't  
             just stand there.  

05:42.900 --> 05:44.600
Yeah, you're right;             
I got to find something         

05:44.600 --> 05:45.900
    to jog her memory.          
                         No, no,

05:46.000 --> 05:47.600
          you got to help me get
        this machine in the car.

05:47.600 --> 05:49.600
                 I've got a gig.

05:55.800 --> 05:57.400
         Test, testing.         

05:57.500 --> 05:59.400
        One, two.               

05:59.400 --> 06:00.600
    A-one, two, three, four.    

06:00.700 --> 06:03.000
      ¶ Chong-ka-ka-chong-      
      ka-chong-ka-chong. ¶      

06:07.000 --> 06:09.300
  We're going to <i>cook</i> tonight.  

06:12.100 --> 06:14.000
Hello, Doc.                     

06:14.000 --> 06:16.100
          Yeah, boy, City Hall--

06:16.100 --> 06:19.700
        the civil servant's home
                 away from home.

06:19.700 --> 06:21.700
    Yeah, you know, whenever    
    the job gets me down, Norm, 

06:21.800 --> 06:24.800
    I just come around here     
        and roam the halls.     

06:24.800 --> 06:28.600
 Hey, pal, I thought we told you
        never to come back here.

06:28.600 --> 06:33.100
            How many times we   
        got to throw you out?   

06:33.200 --> 06:34.800
 Look, I-I'm with the wedding.  

06:34.900 --> 06:36.200
    Is that true, sir?          

06:36.200 --> 06:40.500
Uh, yes, yeah, yeah, it is...   
but, uh, stick around.          

06:43.300 --> 06:46.300
        (panting):              
  Oh, great, I'm not too late.  

06:46.400 --> 06:47.500
        Where's Rebecca?        

06:47.500 --> 06:48.400
        She's in there.         

06:48.500 --> 06:49.600
     What's all this junk?      

06:49.700 --> 06:50.800
Oh, this is, uh,                

06:50.800 --> 06:51.800
         just some of her stuff.

06:51.900 --> 06:53.300
                    I broke into
                  her apartment.

06:53.400 --> 06:57.000
And you passed up               
her stereo equipment for this?  

06:57.000 --> 06:58.500
Stay a bartender, Sam.          

06:58.600 --> 06:59.800
                     No, no, no.

06:59.900 --> 07:00.900
      No, I'm just hoping       
      when she sees this--      

07:01.000 --> 07:02.300
    you know, smells the pizza--

07:02.400 --> 07:04.900
that it'll help bring back      
  her memory about last night.  

07:04.900 --> 07:08.000
     Hey... honey, Rebecca?     

07:09.200 --> 07:10.700
     Hi.                        
        Sam, isn't that mine?   

07:10.700 --> 07:12.300
Yeah, you bet it is.            

07:12.400 --> 07:13.700
Here, open the pizza box.       

07:13.700 --> 07:14.900
Look at that, huh?              

07:14.900 --> 07:18.500
Some pizza with Canadian bacon  
and pineapple and...            

07:18.600 --> 07:21.800
look at your robe here with     
Canadian bacon and pineapple.   

07:21.900 --> 07:22.900
      Huh?                      

07:22.900 --> 07:25.300
Now, does this all              
remind you of something?        

07:25.300 --> 07:27.700
                      (gasping):
            Oh, God, oh, God,   
              I just remembered!

07:27.800 --> 07:28.700
Oh, yes!                        

07:28.800 --> 07:29.900
Oh, God, thank you!             

07:29.900 --> 07:31.600
Th... I thought                 
I was going crazy.              

07:31.700 --> 07:33.600
        Yes, I remembered I left
            my garter in my car.

07:33.700 --> 07:34.900
                Would you get it
                 for me, please?

07:35.000 --> 07:37.500
    Well, sure, but...          

07:37.600 --> 07:40.800
          (blubbering)          

07:40.800 --> 07:43.700
I don't know why people get     
so nutty during weddings.       

07:43.800 --> 07:46.100
Hey, compared to some           
cultures, we got it easy.       

07:46.200 --> 07:50.000
Take the Wanobis                
in Central Africa.              

07:50.100 --> 07:51.800
Now, there's a ceremony.        

07:51.900 --> 07:52.800
See, they get                   
the lovebirds                   

07:52.900 --> 07:54.800
and smear them with a mixture   
of honey and sweet oil.         

07:54.900 --> 07:57.900
Then it's off                   
to the anthill.                 

07:58.000 --> 08:00.300
  Uh, this man's bothering me.  

08:02.700 --> 08:04.700
        We're talking...        

08:04.700 --> 08:06.700
              Why don't you come
                with me, pal?   

08:09.000 --> 08:10.400
We're going to that             
little room downstairs?         

08:10.500 --> 08:12.500
                 Yes, yes.      

08:16.200 --> 08:20.000
Hey, Rebecca, this is...        
wow, nice hair.                 

08:20.100 --> 08:22.100
      I brought you some samples
            I had in the car.   

08:22.200 --> 08:23.100
    Oh, yeah, thanks.           

08:23.200 --> 08:25.400
Give us a yoo-hoo               
if you like them.               

08:25.500 --> 08:26.600
        Honey.                  

08:26.600 --> 08:28.100
Honey...                        
         Sam, where's my garter?

08:28.100 --> 08:29.700
Oh, I sent Woody                
after it.                       

08:29.800 --> 08:32.799
Listen, sweetheart, we've been  
friends for a long time, right? 

08:32.900 --> 08:34.500
                        Right.  
I hope you understand           
that what I'm doing,            

08:34.600 --> 08:35.799
I'm doing for you.              

08:35.900 --> 08:37.299
I'm doing it out of our,        

08:37.299 --> 08:40.000
our friendship                  
over the last four years.       

08:40.000 --> 08:41.200
I'm doing it                    
because I care.                 

08:41.200 --> 08:42.500
            Okay, Sam, go ahead.

08:42.500 --> 08:44.400
Snap out of it,                 
will you?!                      

08:44.400 --> 08:46.600
Let the fog lift here!          

08:46.700 --> 08:48.500
You said that you               
didn't love the guy!            

08:48.600 --> 08:50.300
 What the hell are you doing?!  

08:50.400 --> 08:52.100
(knocking)                      

08:52.200 --> 08:55.400
Uh, Miss Howe, I couldn't find  
your garter in your car,        

08:55.500 --> 08:57.800
but I did find                  
these jumper cables.            

09:02.800 --> 09:06.000
          Woody, what am I going
            to do with these?   

09:06.100 --> 09:07.200
    Well, they may not look     
        so great,               

09:07.200 --> 09:09.600
but they, they'll probably      
    hold up your stockings.     

09:10.900 --> 09:13.800
        Of course,              
    they might leave a mark.    

09:13.900 --> 09:16.400
 Great, and what am I supposed  
to do after the ceremony?       

09:16.500 --> 09:18.700
    Throw a tire iron           
      to the bridesmaids?       

09:18.800 --> 09:21.500
 All right, I'll be right back. 

09:21.600 --> 09:24.400
SAM:                            
Oh, hell, I give up.            

09:24.400 --> 09:25.900
  You know, do what you want.   
          Marry Robin.          

09:26.000 --> 09:28.700
I hope you'll be very happy,    
waking up every morning to...   

09:28.700 --> 09:30.200
    (imitating Robin):          
  ..."Good morning, Rebecca."   

09:30.200 --> 09:31.300
Good morning, Rebecca.          

09:31.400 --> 09:33.700
     (chuckles)                 

09:33.800 --> 09:34.900
Darling,                        
I know it's bad luck            

09:35.000 --> 09:36.500
to see the bride                
before the wedding, but,        

09:36.600 --> 09:38.800
well, I've, uh, lost my fortune;
I've been to prison.            

09:38.800 --> 09:40.500
What more could happen to me?   

09:40.500 --> 09:44.200
You know, I can't keep this     
a secret any longer.            

09:44.300 --> 09:46.100
Do you remember                 
the day we first made love      

09:46.200 --> 09:48.300
and I surprised you             
by flying in                    

09:48.400 --> 09:50.400
Bill Medley of the Righteous    
Brothers to sing for you?       

09:50.500 --> 09:51.300
                 Of course I do.

09:51.300 --> 09:52.400
            That was a wonderful
                 present, Robin.

09:52.400 --> 09:54.300
Well, I thought                 
it would be sweet               

09:54.300 --> 09:57.300
if, uh, I could find some way   
to relive that memory           

09:57.300 --> 10:01.400
on our wedding day, and now     
that I'm finally unchained...   

10:01.400 --> 10:04.800
¶ Oh... my love                 

10:04.800 --> 10:06.200
        (gasping)               

10:06.200 --> 10:08.400
     ¶ My darlin' ¶             

10:08.400 --> 10:09.700
¶ I've hungered                 
for your touch... ¶             

10:09.700 --> 10:11.500
                         My God!

10:11.600 --> 10:15.700
         It's the other         
    Righteous Brother!          

10:15.700 --> 10:18.300
                 Bobby Hatfield.

10:18.300 --> 10:19.400
    Oh, no, no, to me           

10:19.400 --> 10:22.400
he'll always be the other       
    Righteous Brother.          

10:22.500 --> 10:24.700
¶ ...so slowly...               
 I'm, uh, ready to start.       

10:24.700 --> 10:25.800
¶ And time...                   

10:25.900 --> 10:27.200
    Who's this bozo?            

10:30.700 --> 10:32.200
I'm Bobby Hatfield.             

10:32.300 --> 10:33.900
             Yes, Robin gave him
             to me as a present.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
              He's going to sing
                  at my wedding.

10:35.100 --> 10:36.700
        Isn't that wonderful?   

10:36.700 --> 10:38.300
                        Oh.     

10:38.400 --> 10:40.800
                      So he's in
                    and I'm out?

10:40.900 --> 10:43.100
                Well, fine.     

10:43.200 --> 10:45.100
                Instead of my   
          personal gift of song,

10:45.100 --> 10:48.400
             I'll just get you a
            set of steak knives.

10:48.500 --> 10:50.700
              So you can cut out
                 my heart again.

10:54.700 --> 10:58.100
Young man, would you make sure  
everyone gets seated?           

10:58.200 --> 10:59.400
        Oh, yes, Father.        

10:59.500 --> 11:00.900
I'm not a priest.               

11:01.000 --> 11:02.700
I'm a government official.      

11:02.800 --> 11:04.600
      Oh. I'm sorry, Your Honor.

11:04.600 --> 11:06.400
No, son, that would be a judge. 

11:06.500 --> 11:08.900
    I'm a Justice               
    of the Peace.               

11:09.000 --> 11:10.600
                Well, then, what
              should I call you?

11:10.700 --> 11:12.500
You can call me Ed.             

11:15.000 --> 11:16.800
             Well, it looks like

11:16.900 --> 11:19.500
         I... I won't be singing
                      after all.

11:19.600 --> 11:22.400
                 But Rebecca has
        graciously invited me   

11:22.500 --> 11:25.000
             to push the buttons
         for Mr. Bobby Hatfield.

11:27.900 --> 11:29.800
                      Let's see.

11:29.900 --> 11:32.300
                  What number is
             "Unchained Melody?"

11:32.300 --> 11:33.500
             U-14.              

11:34.400 --> 11:36.400
                    Yes, master.

11:39.600 --> 11:41.000
("Unchained Melody" plays)      

11:41.100 --> 11:46.700
        ¶ Oh, my love           

11:46.800 --> 11:48.400
         ¶ My darling           

11:48.500 --> 11:49.800
That's a lovely song.           

11:49.900 --> 11:51.100
          ¶ I hunger            

11:51.200 --> 11:52.900
            That's because we're
        close to the speaker.   

11:53.000 --> 11:54.400
     ¶ For your touch...        

11:54.500 --> 11:56.200
Every time I hear that song,    

11:56.300 --> 11:59.800
it reminds me of the first time 
we saw <i>Ghost.</i>                   

11:59.800 --> 12:04.300
Hey, Lilith, songs do make you  
remember things, right?         

12:04.400 --> 12:05.500
Oh, most definitely.            

12:05.600 --> 12:07.600
      Music is perhaps one      
     of the most evocative      

12:07.600 --> 12:08.800
    of the associative          
            stimuli.            

12:08.800 --> 12:10.100
          ¶ And I...            

12:10.200 --> 12:13.300
Some fascinating data-gathering 
was done in 1957                

12:13.400 --> 12:15.000
                    in Brussels,
                     when the...

12:15.100 --> 12:17.100
        ¶ So slowly...          

12:17.200 --> 12:19.700
They always leave when I get    
to the interesting part.        

12:19.800 --> 12:21.400
        ¶ And time...           

12:21.400 --> 12:23.100
(instrumental intro plays       
    for "We've Got Tonight")    

12:23.200 --> 12:24.200
It's okay.                      

12:24.300 --> 12:25.500
It's her other                  
favorite song.                  

12:25.600 --> 12:28.400
¶ We've got tonight... ¶        

12:28.400 --> 12:30.300
            She sang it to me   
                just last night.

12:30.300 --> 12:34.600
             BOBBY:             
    ¶ Who needs tomorrow?       

12:34.600 --> 12:37.200
  ¶ Let's make it last, babe ¶  

12:37.200 --> 12:38.500
      ¶ Let's find a way ¶      

12:38.600 --> 12:40.300
             I know             
  I've heard this song before.  

12:40.400 --> 12:41.900
    ¶ Turn out the lights       

12:42.000 --> 12:44.100
  I just can't remember when.   

12:44.200 --> 12:45.900
  ¶ Come on and hold my hand    

12:46.000 --> 12:47.200
    It seems like it was...     

12:47.300 --> 12:51.400
¶ We got tonight, honey         
            Oh, God!            

12:51.400 --> 12:54.700
    ¶ Why don't you stay? ¶     

12:56.800 --> 12:59.100
    ¶ Why don't you stay? ¶     

13:00.600 --> 13:03.700
¶ Turn out the light...         

13:11.400 --> 13:13.200
                Rebecca, this   
                    is insanity!

13:13.300 --> 13:14.600
                  Open the door!

13:14.700 --> 13:16.700
Is she ready to go on           
with the ceremony?              

13:16.800 --> 13:18.800
We're on a very tight           
schedule here.                  

13:18.900 --> 13:21.300
I have fishing licenses         
to pass out.                    

13:24.200 --> 13:26.900
     Uh, well, there's got to be
      another key someplace, Ed.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.300
  Second floor.                 

13:28.400 --> 13:29.700
        Security.               

13:29.800 --> 13:31.800
            Oh. You know, I just
          don't understand this.

13:31.900 --> 13:34.400
             She's always seemed
            so stable before.   

13:34.500 --> 13:36.500
                Did you two ever
                    really talk?

13:39.800 --> 13:41.500
    Hey, guy, what's, uh...     
        what's going on?        

13:41.600 --> 13:42.700
Did I miss much?                

13:42.800 --> 13:43.900
            Uh, no, not much.   

13:44.000 --> 13:45.900
          Looks like the wedding
                might be off.   

13:46.000 --> 13:47.600
What are you talking about?     

13:47.600 --> 13:50.000
After I spent all that time     
tying tin cans                  

13:50.100 --> 13:51.800
to the back of Robin's car      

13:51.800 --> 13:53.500
and spraying it                 
with shaving cream,             

13:53.600 --> 13:55.200
tying toilet paper to it?       

13:55.200 --> 13:57.400
                Robin doesn't   
                     have a car.

14:01.300 --> 14:03.600
Oh.                             

14:03.600 --> 14:06.000
It just irritates me.           

14:06.100 --> 14:09.200
I mean, I was all ready         
to sing at this wedding,        

14:09.200 --> 14:11.000
            and then you walk   
                    in the door.

14:11.100 --> 14:13.300
         Well, naturally, you're
              the better singer.

14:13.400 --> 14:14.600
          You're a professional.

14:14.600 --> 14:16.300
     Well, I'd be willing to bet

14:16.400 --> 14:18.400
 that I'm a better psychiatrist 
         than you are.          

14:18.500 --> 14:19.600
Really?                         

14:19.700 --> 14:21.700
Uh, how long                    
have you felt this way?         

14:23.900 --> 14:26.100
                Then again, I   
                 could be wrong.

14:26.100 --> 14:28.100
Boy, I could sure go            
for a taste of this cake.       

14:28.100 --> 14:30.900
      We really don't need      
 this congratulations anymore.  

14:32.000 --> 14:33.500
No.                             

14:33.500 --> 14:35.600
    Not if they're not          
        getting married.        
                            Hey.

14:35.700 --> 14:37.800
  Wow, we've really kind of made
a mess of this top part here.   

14:37.800 --> 14:39.200
    CARLA:                      
    Yeah.                       
             Yeah.              

14:39.300 --> 14:40.400
Yeah, well, we'll just take out 
        the whole layer.        

14:40.500 --> 14:42.200
                     Okay.      
            CARLA:              
            Yeah!               

14:43.700 --> 14:45.900
Are you ready to go on          
with the ceremony?              

14:45.900 --> 14:47.000
                    No. Not yet.

14:47.100 --> 14:49.200
                  I need to work
            a few things out.   

14:49.200 --> 14:50.900
            I-I need somebody   
                     to talk to.

14:50.900 --> 14:52.100
                        Anybody.

14:52.200 --> 14:54.400
                 I-I... I really
                 need some help!

14:58.200 --> 14:59.900
    (crowd murmuring)           

15:09.400 --> 15:11.600
                        REBECCA:
                    Not Paul!   

15:16.400 --> 15:19.400
     I can't help somebody      
 who doesn't want to be helped. 

15:22.000 --> 15:23.500
You okay, honey?                

15:23.600 --> 15:25.500
                 No. I need time
                    to think.   

15:25.600 --> 15:27.000
         I have to talk         
    to somebody about this.     

15:27.000 --> 15:28.300
  I-I need to talk to somebody  

15:28.300 --> 15:30.400
 so they can help me figure out 
      what my problem is.       

15:30.500 --> 15:31.900
Did you try talking to Paul?    

15:32.000 --> 15:33.300
                        (scoffs)

15:33.400 --> 15:36.100
  No, I did not talk to Paul!   

15:36.200 --> 15:37.500
Well, he's always helped me.    

15:37.600 --> 15:39.800
He's got a super                
outlook on life.                

15:40.800 --> 15:42.700
                You know,       

15:42.800 --> 15:44.600
          when I heard that song
            starting to play,   

15:44.700 --> 15:46.300
suddenly, it all                
came back to me.                

15:46.300 --> 15:48.200
Everything that I said          
last night.                     

15:48.300 --> 15:49.800
                    Oh!         
    Oh, God, Sam!               

15:49.900 --> 15:52.100
Why is this happening to me?!   

15:52.200 --> 15:53.600
  Because you don't love him.   

15:53.700 --> 15:55.100
I know. I <i>did</i> love him.         

15:55.100 --> 15:57.700
         Well, m-maybe you loved
        him when he was rich,   

15:57.700 --> 15:59.300
but that's different now.       

15:59.400 --> 16:01.100
                 What?! What are
                     you saying?

16:01.100 --> 16:03.400
        Are you saying that I   
          only cared about Robin

16:03.500 --> 16:04.700
              when he had money?

16:04.700 --> 16:06.500
Well, it's the truth, isn't it? 

16:06.600 --> 16:08.400
            How dare you tell me

16:08.400 --> 16:10.800
        that I only loved him   
                  for his money!

16:10.900 --> 16:12.800
          I am not that shallow.

16:12.800 --> 16:13.900
                I am not that   
                    superficial.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
        I am not that creepy!   

16:16.100 --> 16:17.800
        You think that I only   
        loved him for his money.

16:17.900 --> 16:19.200
                Well, you are   
                  wrong, buster,

16:19.200 --> 16:21.100
and I'm gonna prove it.         

16:21.200 --> 16:23.100
Robin! Ed! Bobby!               

16:23.200 --> 16:25.100
        Hit it!                 

16:25.200 --> 16:27.900
("Unchained Melody" plays)      

16:27.900 --> 16:30.600
    ¶ Oh, my love...            

16:30.600 --> 16:33.100
         Cliff, let's try to put
         the cake back together.

16:33.100 --> 16:34.500
Forget the cake.                

16:34.600 --> 16:37.300
How are we going to get         
these presents re-wrapped?      

16:37.400 --> 16:42.600
¶ Hunger for your touch         

16:42.700 --> 16:51.000
¶ A long lonely time...         

16:51.100 --> 16:52.300
    (tape clicks off)           

16:52.300 --> 16:53.900
Under the bylaws                

16:54.000 --> 16:56.700
of the Massachusetts            
Fish and Game Commission...     

16:56.800 --> 16:58.900
             Oops.              

16:59.000 --> 17:00.200
             Sorry.             

17:00.300 --> 17:01.500
That's... that's                
all right, Ed.                  

17:01.500 --> 17:03.900
We've, um...                    
We've prepared our own vows.    

17:03.900 --> 17:05.900
ED:                             
Oh. Go ahead.                   

17:06.000 --> 17:09.599
Shall I compare thee            
to a Summer's day?              

17:09.700 --> 17:13.000
Thou art more lovely            
and more temperate:             

17:13.000 --> 17:15.800
Rough winds do shake            
the darling buds of May         

17:15.900 --> 17:19.200
and Summer's lease have all     
too short a stay:               

17:19.300 --> 17:21.599
Sometime too hot the eye        
of heaven doth shine,           

17:21.700 --> 17:24.500
and often is his                
gold complexion dimmed;         

17:24.599 --> 17:27.400
And every fair from fair        
sometime declines,              

17:27.500 --> 17:31.800
by chance or nature's changing  
course untrimmed;               

17:31.800 --> 17:35.100
But thy eternal Summer          
shall not fade,                 

17:35.200 --> 17:38.300
nor lose possession             
of that fair thou owest;        

17:38.300 --> 17:42.900
Nor shall Death brag            
thou wanderest in his shade     

17:43.000 --> 17:48.300
when in eternal lines           
to time thou owest:             

17:48.300 --> 17:50.400
As long as men can breathe      

17:50.400 --> 17:53.600
or eyes can see,                

17:53.600 --> 17:55.700
so long lives this,             

17:55.700 --> 18:00.400
and this gives life to thee.    

18:04.500 --> 18:06.800
    R-Rebecca?                  

18:13.100 --> 18:16.400
     I only loved you           
     for your money.            

18:27.200 --> 18:29.500
            REBECCA:            
          I'm hateful.          

18:29.500 --> 18:33.700
I am the most awful person      
that I have ever met in my life.

18:35.500 --> 18:37.700
        I don't deserve to live.

18:37.700 --> 18:39.800
      Carla, what am I gonna do?

18:42.000 --> 18:45.100
You could throw yourself        
into the Charles.               

18:48.000 --> 18:50.500
            I don't think so.   

18:50.600 --> 18:53.100
How about heaving yourself off  
the Prudential Building?        

18:54.500 --> 18:56.200
That's a 52-story drop.         

18:56.300 --> 18:57.500
You hit the pavement,           

18:57.600 --> 19:00.300
they'll be scraping you up      
with a spatula,                 

19:00.400 --> 19:02.600
just like they do               
in the cartoons!                

19:02.700 --> 19:04.500
                    Oh!         

19:04.600 --> 19:06.200
You know, Paul was right.       

19:06.200 --> 19:09.300
    You can't help somebody     
 who doesn't want to be helped. 

19:12.500 --> 19:14.800
        Aw, honey.              

19:15.800 --> 19:17.500
Sweetheart?                     

19:17.500 --> 19:20.300
I-I know it's been a hell       
of a day for you,               

19:20.400 --> 19:22.800
and we all really               
feel bad for you,               

19:22.900 --> 19:25.300
but there's just                
one more thing.                 

19:25.300 --> 19:27.000
                 What?          

19:27.100 --> 19:30.700
Well, it's kind of              
a good news-bad news thing.     

19:30.800 --> 19:33.900
        Oh. What's the bad news?

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
Well, the bad news is           

19:36.100 --> 19:38.200
Robin's outside,                
and he wants to talk to you.    

19:38.300 --> 19:40.900
                (groans)        
                Oh, my God.     

19:40.900 --> 19:43.700
        What's the good news?   

19:43.800 --> 19:46.500
I lied about the good news.     

19:51.100 --> 19:53.300
Will you see him?               

19:55.200 --> 19:57.200
Hey, will you look at that!     

19:57.200 --> 19:59.600
Your hair still retained        
its bounce!                     

19:59.600 --> 20:01.700
I mean, that's something,       
isn't it?                       

20:04.100 --> 20:05.800
            Rebecca?            

20:05.900 --> 20:07.900
What's going on?                

20:08.000 --> 20:10.100
  Have I done something wrong?  

20:10.200 --> 20:12.300
  Oh, no. Robin, it's not you.  

20:12.300 --> 20:14.400
            It's me.            

20:14.500 --> 20:16.800
      I don't understand.       

20:16.900 --> 20:20.000
      Oh, I can't say this      
         to your face.          

20:20.000 --> 20:22.100
      Please turn around.       

20:24.700 --> 20:28.500
                 Oh, gee, you've
                got a cute butt.

20:30.800 --> 20:32.300
    Robin, I can't say this     
         to your butt.          

20:32.400 --> 20:34.200
              Turn around again.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.300
    I don't love you, Robin.    

20:43.300 --> 20:45.600
     When did this happen?      

20:45.600 --> 20:47.200
             Well,              

20:47.300 --> 20:48.900
        near as I can figure,   

20:49.000 --> 20:52.400
about the time they sealed      
your safe deposit box.          

20:54.600 --> 20:57.300
 But I thought you were the one 
who didn't care about my money. 

20:57.400 --> 20:59.600
      I thought you were the one
who was going to stand by me.   

20:59.700 --> 21:03.100
I thought I was your sweet baby.

21:03.200 --> 21:04.800
        No.                     

21:04.900 --> 21:06.400
You was my rich baby.           

21:07.300 --> 21:08.700
         All right, so,         

21:08.800 --> 21:10.300
you loved me                    
for my money.                   

21:10.400 --> 21:12.600
Well, what if I were            
to tell you                     

21:12.600 --> 21:14.800
     that I had $6 million      
          stashed away          

21:14.900 --> 21:16.800
        in a money belt         
    before my arrest?           

21:16.800 --> 21:18.600
      Now, would that make      
        any difference?         

21:18.700 --> 21:20.400
              No.               

21:20.500 --> 21:22.200
        No, it wouldn't.        

21:24.600 --> 21:25.800
             I see.             

21:25.800 --> 21:27.000
        (clicks tongue)         

21:27.100 --> 21:29.000
         Well...                

21:32.900 --> 21:34.000
          What's that?          

21:34.100 --> 21:35.700
          $6 million.           

21:37.000 --> 21:38.600
    Farewell, Rebecca.          

21:43.800 --> 21:46.900
Honey, I hope you don't mind,   
but I was listening outside.    

21:46.900 --> 21:49.600
I can't believe                 
you turned down all that cash!  

21:49.700 --> 21:50.600
You're changing, honey.         

21:50.700 --> 21:52.800
That was the bravest thing      
I've ever seen you do!          

21:52.900 --> 21:56.600
        (sobbing):              
I thought he was bluffing,      

21:56.700 --> 21:58.000
        Sam!                    

21:58.100 --> 21:59.300
Just let me go!                 

21:59.300 --> 22:01.300
                  No! <i>No!</i>       

22:01.400 --> 22:02.900
                       <i>No!</i>
