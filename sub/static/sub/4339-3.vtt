WEBVTT

00:02.135 --> 00:05.804
-<i> Previously on</i> The Strain...
- There's no cure. And you can

00:05.806 --> 00:08.206
strike a blow against
this disease, help stop it

00:08.208 --> 00:11.876
for everybody's children.
- Harrison, we have to do this.

00:11.878 --> 00:13.944
- Please, listen to me.
If you go out there,

00:13.946 --> 00:15.779
you will be killed.
- Hey! What are you doing? Stop!

00:15.781 --> 00:18.681
- Nikki!
- Don't!

00:18.683 --> 00:20.783
- The girl I was with
at the store?

00:20.785 --> 00:23.852
We were more than roommates.
We were very close.

00:23.854 --> 00:26.721
- We're gonna take back Staten
Island one block at a time.

00:26.723 --> 00:30.324
Then we're gonna secure the
perimeter so no more can get in.

00:30.326 --> 00:34.227
- We need a human soldier who
can move freely in the daylight.

00:34.229 --> 00:37.897
Someone who can use
the power of the sun.

00:37.899 --> 00:40.199
You have proven
yourself capable.

00:40.201 --> 00:42.801
- I'm listening.

00:54.546 --> 00:57.447
(siren whooping)

01:03.052 --> 01:07.087
(honking)

01:09.390 --> 01:12.959
- Here we go.
(radio chatter)

01:16.663 --> 01:18.597
- What are you doing there, pal?
- Hands above your head!

01:18.599 --> 01:20.432
- What you got in the sack,
buddy?

01:20.434 --> 01:23.234
What you got in there, huh?

01:25.837 --> 01:29.673
(unzipping)
- It's full of dirt.

01:29.675 --> 01:31.574
- What are you doing
in the middle of the night

01:31.576 --> 01:34.410
dragging that
shit around, huh? Hey!

01:34.412 --> 01:37.513
I know you.
You're that singer, Bolivar.

01:37.515 --> 01:39.948
You own this place,
don't you?

01:39.950 --> 01:44.085
- Don't touch that.
You're not worthy to touch it.

01:44.087 --> 01:47.855
- This guy's as high as a kite.
- I wouldn't do that.

01:47.857 --> 01:50.357
It's the Master's
resting ground.

01:53.127 --> 01:55.761
(rustling sound)

01:55.763 --> 01:58.363
(groaning)
(screaming)

01:58.365 --> 02:01.932
(laughing)
(screaming)

02:01.934 --> 02:04.968
- Come here!

02:04.970 --> 02:08.071
(grunting)
Freeze!

02:08.073 --> 02:10.039
(firing)

02:10.041 --> 02:14.042
(shrieking)

02:14.044 --> 02:16.310
(echoing shrieks)

02:19.714 --> 02:21.948
(shattering)
- Officer down!

02:21.950 --> 02:25.785
I repeat, officer down!

02:25.787 --> 02:28.754
- This is 6 Delta 4. Immediate
backup requested at Vestry Hall!

02:28.756 --> 02:31.389
AHH!
Those creatures!

02:31.391 --> 02:33.624
(snarling)

02:33.626 --> 02:36.460
They're all over us! AHH!
(snarling)

02:36.462 --> 02:40.497
(screaming)

02:47.838 --> 02:50.573
(theme music playing)

03:05.321 --> 03:07.755
- Oh, my God.
(low croaking)

03:07.757 --> 03:10.124
- It's working.

03:10.126 --> 03:12.593
- We did it.

03:12.595 --> 03:17.030
(shrieking)
(weak croaking)

03:17.032 --> 03:20.600
- Shit. It's happening too fast.
Come on, hang in there!

03:20.602 --> 03:24.136
Stay with us.
(gasping)

03:24.138 --> 03:26.505
(gasping suddenly stops)

03:33.278 --> 03:35.712
OW! Oh!
(yelping)

03:38.816 --> 03:41.450
(sizzling)

03:41.452 --> 03:45.487
DAMN IT!

03:45.489 --> 03:47.856
- At least we know it works.
- It happened too fast.

03:47.858 --> 03:49.924
If they die on the spot,
we get no transmission.

03:52.027 --> 03:54.795
- Go get some rest.
I'll stay and work on this,

03:54.797 --> 03:56.830
make it less potent.

03:56.832 --> 03:58.898
I haven't been
sleeping much anyway.

03:58.900 --> 04:01.300
- I know.

04:01.302 --> 04:05.470
(rattling gasps)

04:12.544 --> 04:16.113
(helicopter blades whirring)

04:19.250 --> 04:21.251
(low growl)

04:21.253 --> 04:23.086
(hissing and snarling)

04:23.088 --> 04:26.422
(firing)
(sizzling)

04:26.424 --> 04:29.391
(shrieking and croaking)

04:33.996 --> 04:36.297
(sword clattering)

04:55.049 --> 04:57.150
(hissing and squelching)

05:02.588 --> 05:05.422
(panting)

05:08.392 --> 05:12.762
(low growl)

05:18.801 --> 05:23.103
(snarling)

05:23.105 --> 05:27.774
(snorting)

05:32.445 --> 05:35.447
(snarling)

05:40.252 --> 05:42.253
- Hey, how's it going?

05:42.255 --> 05:46.756
(shrieking)
(firing)

05:46.758 --> 05:51.059
(snarling)

05:51.061 --> 05:53.761
- Damn, you look like you had
a rough night.

05:53.763 --> 05:57.231
(clicking)

05:57.233 --> 06:00.100
- All right, now hand-to-hand.

06:00.102 --> 06:04.169
Like I showed you.
- I got you.

06:04.171 --> 06:07.338
Come on! Come on! Come on!

06:07.340 --> 06:10.140
- Offense, not defense!

06:10.142 --> 06:14.410
(shrieking)
(grunting)

06:14.412 --> 06:18.447
(ripping)
(hissing)

06:18.449 --> 06:21.683
Focus!

06:35.196 --> 06:39.198
Excellent.

06:39.200 --> 06:41.967
- This is bullshit!
(panting)

06:41.969 --> 06:44.336
Why you got me running around
here like an asshole?

06:44.338 --> 06:49.273
- We are about to embark
on a most important mission.

06:49.275 --> 06:51.275
- Is that why you give a gun
with only two bullets?

06:51.277 --> 06:53.310
- You should've checked
the magazine.

06:53.312 --> 06:55.378
- I should have
checked my sanity

06:55.380 --> 06:57.513
to ever team up
with a guy like you.

06:57.515 --> 07:00.449
Now you gonna tell me about
this big mission,

07:00.451 --> 07:04.352
the one that's so important,
or I'm outta here.

07:04.354 --> 07:08.189
- Mm...

07:08.191 --> 07:12.526
We're going to kidnap
Eldritch Palmer.

07:30.144 --> 07:33.246
(squealing)

07:54.768 --> 07:57.169
- Oh, God...

07:57.171 --> 07:59.171
- (TV):<i> In Albany, the governor</i>
<i> has signed an order</i>

07:59.173 --> 08:01.072
<i> to deploy state police</i>
<i> to patrol</i>

08:01.074 --> 08:03.040
<i> and close highways</i>
<i> leading to Pennsylvania...</i>

08:03.042 --> 08:04.608
- Is Zack in his room?

08:04.610 --> 08:07.210
- Always about the kid with you,
isn't it?

08:07.212 --> 08:10.246
I thought you were gonna sit
and have a kiki with me.

08:10.248 --> 08:12.615
- I might if I had any idea
what that meant.

08:12.617 --> 08:15.084
- Like, gossip.

08:15.086 --> 08:18.887
We sit, have a chat,
like we're friends.

08:18.889 --> 08:21.089
(rhythmic tapping)

08:29.865 --> 08:32.199
- Thank you, thank you.

08:32.201 --> 08:35.168
I just put up 300 of these
all around Red Hook.

08:37.738 --> 08:41.107
- Did you draw this, Dutch?

08:41.109 --> 08:43.075
That's not bad.

08:43.077 --> 08:46.878
- Mm, thanks.
- His talent is sexy,

08:46.880 --> 08:49.213
don't you think?
- Super sexy. ZACK!

08:53.150 --> 08:55.484
Zack? Hmm!

08:55.486 --> 08:58.119
Flyer's a little subtle for you,
don't you think?

08:58.121 --> 09:00.621
- Ah, well, firepower's
coming, Doc.

09:00.623 --> 09:02.556
Tomorrow we're doing recon

09:02.558 --> 09:05.258
at the subway tunnel right
at the edge of Red Hook.

09:05.260 --> 09:08.794
Time to stop muncher tourists
from coming in from Manhattan.

09:08.796 --> 09:11.596
You know, boom, boom. Bye-bye.

09:11.598 --> 09:13.598
- You're going to
blow up the subway?

09:13.600 --> 09:16.834
- We're just going to seal off
the entrance, you know?

09:16.836 --> 09:21.405
The tunnel will be fine.

09:21.407 --> 09:24.274
- Is this foreplay for you two?
- Vasiliy does love

09:24.276 --> 09:26.609
a good explosion.

09:26.611 --> 09:29.812
- Zack?

09:29.814 --> 09:32.181
- When was the last time
you saw the kid?

09:32.183 --> 09:35.817
- I dunno. About an hour ago
when I left?

09:37.686 --> 09:40.020
- His coat and boots are gone.

09:40.022 --> 09:43.489
- All right, Doc, wait up.
We're coming with you.

09:43.491 --> 09:45.691
(mashing)

10:09.681 --> 10:12.949
(bus engine revving)

10:19.389 --> 10:22.991
- Jesus Christ! ZACK!

10:22.993 --> 10:25.727
STOP!

10:25.729 --> 10:29.897
(slamming)
Hey! Stop the bus!

10:34.168 --> 10:36.402
Whoa! Whoa. Sorry, sorry.
That's my son.

10:36.404 --> 10:40.372
- Oh, thank God!
- This your Daddy?

10:40.374 --> 10:43.007
- Yes.
(clicking tongue)

10:43.009 --> 10:45.643
- Get your ass off my bus!
- Thank you.

10:45.645 --> 10:50.347
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHERE WERE YOU GOING?

10:50.349 --> 10:52.582
- Queens.

10:52.584 --> 10:55.585
- It's too dangerous to travel
alone, Zack. You know that.

10:55.587 --> 10:57.853
- I want Mom to see me again.

10:57.855 --> 10:59.988
I think she misses me.

10:59.990 --> 11:03.257
- (Dutch): Holy shit! What?

11:03.259 --> 11:05.659
(sighing)

11:05.661 --> 11:08.894
- Who put this up? - Is that your
friend from the convenience store?

11:10.997 --> 11:15.033
The one that stole all your money, huh?
- Yeah, who would put this up?

11:16.702 --> 11:19.203
- Hey, you gave
your pop a scare.

11:19.205 --> 11:22.606
You at least carrying?

11:22.608 --> 11:26.276
- You're coming to the lab
with me tomorrow.

11:26.278 --> 11:31.214
- What for?
- You'll see.

11:42.225 --> 11:45.126
- Hey, Professor, how you doing?
You all right?

11:45.128 --> 11:47.962
- I... I'm fine. I'm reading.

11:47.964 --> 11:50.397
Don't bother me.
- All right.

11:50.399 --> 11:53.066
You have a good night, too.

12:04.644 --> 12:08.580
(sighing and groaning softly)

12:37.876 --> 12:41.278
(sirens wailing)
(tires screeching)

12:46.417 --> 12:48.718
- Setrakian, I'm going
to the lab.

12:48.720 --> 12:52.788
I left some coffee
on the hot plate for you.

12:52.790 --> 12:56.258
(knocking)
Professor?

13:00.562 --> 13:03.230
Professor? Shit!

13:03.232 --> 13:06.633
(rattling)

13:06.635 --> 13:09.802
(clattering)
(sliding)

13:09.804 --> 13:12.104
Oh, God.

13:12.106 --> 13:16.074
No, no...

13:16.076 --> 13:19.844
Come on!

13:25.917 --> 13:27.918
Come on.

13:27.920 --> 13:32.154
(coughing)

13:33.656 --> 13:36.557
Oh, thank God.
(coughing)

13:59.947 --> 14:02.014
One more.
(groaning)

14:02.016 --> 14:04.116
What did you do?

14:04.118 --> 14:07.852
This blood is from your eyes.

14:07.854 --> 14:10.454
- My... My eyes are old.

14:10.456 --> 14:13.356
They... They bleed.

14:13.358 --> 14:15.524
Things give way at my age.

14:15.526 --> 14:17.959
- People's eyes
don't just bleed.

14:17.961 --> 14:20.161
What was in the eyedropper?

14:20.163 --> 14:22.530
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

14:22.532 --> 14:24.665
I need rest!

14:24.667 --> 14:27.567
Please!

14:58.331 --> 15:00.532
- (woman on PA): [Current
wait time for entry]

15:00.534 --> 15:02.500
[is approximately 90 minutes.]

15:02.502 --> 15:05.035
[Current wait time for entry]

15:05.037 --> 15:07.570
[is approximately 90 minutes.]

15:09.472 --> 15:11.473
- Hi.

15:11.475 --> 15:13.208
- Next, please.

15:13.210 --> 15:16.644
- Fitzwilliam. Isn't that
an Irish name? - Yes, it is.

15:16.646 --> 15:18.045
- What's your business
on Staten Island?

15:18.047 --> 15:19.846
- I'm here to visit my brother.

15:19.848 --> 15:22.081
- Is that a "brother" brother
or your real brother?

15:22.083 --> 15:25.751
- Curtis Fitzwilliam
is my biological brother.

15:25.753 --> 15:28.854
He's a firefighter,
Ladder 84, Drundegle Road.

15:28.856 --> 15:31.289
He lives in Tauntenville.

15:35.027 --> 15:37.895
- Mr. Fitzwilliam, put
your toes on the yellow line,

15:37.897 --> 15:39.363
put your arms out
to the side.

15:39.365 --> 15:42.032
Now, please, open your mouth
and tilt your head back.

15:42.034 --> 15:44.234
- And if I refuse?
- Buddy, you left your

15:44.236 --> 15:47.237
civil rights on the other side
of the Hudson.

15:51.207 --> 15:54.042
- All clear.
- You're good to go.

15:54.044 --> 15:56.244
Welcome to Staten Island.

16:05.186 --> 16:08.755
(elevator dinging)

16:11.859 --> 16:14.794
- Mr. Eichhorst.

16:14.796 --> 16:16.962
(lock beeping)
I'm afraid I don't see you

16:16.964 --> 16:19.030
on the schedule.
- That's right.

16:19.032 --> 16:22.733
That is because I am never
on the schedule.

16:22.735 --> 16:26.970
- Eldritch!
- Herr Eichhorst.

16:26.972 --> 16:31.473
State your business.
- Your encounter with Setrakian.

16:31.475 --> 16:35.076
He was able to get
way too close.

16:35.078 --> 16:37.078
That could've ended
very badly for us.

16:37.080 --> 16:39.814
- But it didn't.
- Nonetheless, your

16:39.816 --> 16:42.950
security detail
has gotten sloppy.

16:42.952 --> 16:46.987
- You are very important
to us, Eldritch,

16:46.989 --> 16:51.657
so we're leaving Mr. Bolivar
here to keep an eye on things.

16:51.659 --> 16:54.459
(slamming book down)

16:54.461 --> 16:56.561
- Will you excuse us, please,

16:56.563 --> 16:59.797
Ms. Marchand?
- Certainly.

16:59.799 --> 17:02.299
- Thank you.

17:06.336 --> 17:09.738
The man is a pop star,
am I correct?

17:09.740 --> 17:12.474
- I'm a servant, just like you.

17:12.476 --> 17:15.410
The Master wants me
to stay here,

17:15.412 --> 17:17.445
I'll stay here until
he says otherwise.

17:17.447 --> 17:21.315
- I appreciate the offer,
but I must decline.

17:21.317 --> 17:23.650
Respectfully, of course.

17:23.652 --> 17:26.252
- This is not a matter
of declining or accepting,

17:26.254 --> 17:29.154
it is a statement of fact.

17:31.023 --> 17:35.192
He stays.

17:39.864 --> 17:42.098
- Very well.

17:42.100 --> 17:45.935
He stays.

17:52.341 --> 17:55.208
(knocking)

17:57.144 --> 17:59.612
- Reggie!

18:05.685 --> 18:07.886
- Do you want to tell me
what's going on?

18:07.888 --> 18:12.657
- I quit my job.
- You're shitting me.

18:12.659 --> 18:13.724
- Yeah, you were
right about Palmer.

18:13.726 --> 18:16.193
I should've listened to you

18:16.195 --> 18:18.528
years ago.
- Good for you, man.

18:22.732 --> 18:24.833
- During the Revolutionary War,

18:24.835 --> 18:28.336
the Americans held you limeys
off right here in Red Hook.

18:28.338 --> 18:32.473
There was a fort that covered
most of the Red Hook peninsula.

18:32.475 --> 18:35.342
They called it Fort Defiance.

18:35.344 --> 18:38.211
That's us.
(chuckling)

18:38.213 --> 18:40.880
We're gonna do
the same thing.

18:40.882 --> 18:42.882
There.

18:42.884 --> 18:46.518
If we just take out these
columns over here, you know,

18:46.520 --> 18:48.520
that should do the trick.
Structurally, those are

18:48.522 --> 18:51.723
the critical parts.

18:59.531 --> 19:03.267
You wanna go look
for your friend? - Yeah.

19:03.269 --> 19:08.871
It's that, if her mother
didn't put those flyers up,

19:08.873 --> 19:12.207
then I gotta know who did.

19:12.209 --> 19:15.543
- You chicks like closure,

19:15.545 --> 19:18.445
so we're gonna get you closure.

19:18.447 --> 19:22.114
But right now, I need
your head in the game!

19:22.116 --> 19:25.350
Let's go.

19:25.352 --> 19:29.020
- It's not easy to get around
our city these days.

19:29.022 --> 19:32.690
Trust me, it's worth it
to come out here.

19:32.692 --> 19:37.094
I give you Councilwoman
Justine Feraldo.

19:37.096 --> 19:39.729
(cheers and applause)

19:39.731 --> 19:41.864
- Well, you know it's an
occasion when His Honor

19:41.866 --> 19:44.132
crosses the Verrazano Bridge.

19:44.134 --> 19:47.068
(polite laughter)
- I am pleased to announce

19:47.070 --> 19:49.103
that as of 9:00 AM this morning,

19:49.105 --> 19:52.139
Staten Island
is a plague-free zone.

19:52.141 --> 19:55.942
(applause)
- Now, this would not have

19:55.944 --> 19:58.544
been possible without the
leadership of my Police Captain,

19:58.546 --> 20:02.147
my field general here,
Frank Kowalski.

20:02.149 --> 20:04.949
(applause)
- Good going, Frank.

20:04.951 --> 20:07.418
(camera shutters clicking)

20:07.420 --> 20:09.453
Captain, please do the honors.

20:09.455 --> 20:11.588
- Hey, Mikey,
get the other side.

20:11.590 --> 20:14.657
- Yes, boss.

20:14.659 --> 20:17.292
- Mikey's my nephew.

20:17.294 --> 20:19.227
His dad -- my brother --
was a firefighter

20:19.229 --> 20:22.396
with my late husband, Tommy,
in Tower 2 when it went down.

20:22.398 --> 20:24.765
(applause and murmurs)

20:24.767 --> 20:26.800
He's working for us
night and day

20:26.802 --> 20:30.302
as one of New York City's
finest. All right.

20:30.304 --> 20:33.071
Pull it down.

20:33.073 --> 20:35.506
(gasps and murmuring)

20:35.508 --> 20:37.608
- (woman): What the hell
do you think you're doing?

20:37.610 --> 20:40.310
- (man): Murderer! - (woman):
You can't do this, Feraldo!

20:40.312 --> 20:42.011
- (man): This is crazy!

20:42.013 --> 20:44.446
- This is our message.

20:44.448 --> 20:46.481
- (woman): Yeah!

20:46.483 --> 20:48.749
- (man): Do it!

20:48.751 --> 20:50.250
We're with you!

20:50.252 --> 20:51.684
- (woman):
Let's nail the bastards!

20:51.686 --> 20:53.619
- And we're going
to leave it

20:53.621 --> 20:56.288
right at the entrance
to our borough.

20:56.290 --> 21:00.258
This is who we are.
This is Staten Island.

21:00.260 --> 21:02.660
(whooping and cheering)

21:12.604 --> 21:15.205
- I want you to do
what you've done here

21:15.207 --> 21:17.307
for the rest of the city.

21:17.309 --> 21:21.611
- I don't think so.
- Justine,

21:21.613 --> 21:24.313
there are eight and a half
million people out there

21:24.315 --> 21:26.315
who need our help.

21:26.317 --> 21:29.784
You can be a hero to them.

21:29.786 --> 21:31.752
Not just here

21:31.754 --> 21:34.755
on the island,

21:34.757 --> 21:38.958
but over there, to all of them
on the big island.

21:38.960 --> 21:41.894
They need you.

21:41.896 --> 21:46.064
They need you, Justine.

21:46.066 --> 21:48.466
You can rise.

21:48.468 --> 21:52.002
- No interference.

21:52.004 --> 21:55.271
None. I call the shots,

21:55.273 --> 21:57.405
end of story.

22:00.242 --> 22:02.610
- I have one condition.

22:02.612 --> 22:05.446
- What's that?

22:05.448 --> 22:08.582
- This has to look like

22:08.584 --> 22:11.451
it comes from both of us.

22:11.453 --> 22:13.619
We present as a team.

22:13.621 --> 22:16.321
- All right.

22:18.791 --> 22:22.894
- Great, great. Thank you.

22:31.269 --> 22:33.603
- Suddenly you're healthy?

22:33.605 --> 22:36.939
- Yes, so therefore you

22:36.941 --> 22:39.708
needn't concern
yourself anymore.

22:39.710 --> 22:43.344
- I was the first
to believe in you, to trust you.

22:43.346 --> 22:46.914
To bring you with us.
And I just saved your life!

22:50.685 --> 22:54.487
- You might be more disappointed
in me if I told you the truth.

22:54.489 --> 22:57.723
- I don't care!
You won't treat me like this!

22:57.725 --> 23:00.092
I'm your friend.

23:05.564 --> 23:07.965
- All right.

23:07.967 --> 23:10.400
But you must promise
not to tell anyone --

23:10.402 --> 23:12.635
including Ephraim.

23:12.637 --> 23:15.404
- You have my word.

23:18.641 --> 23:22.043
- I've...

23:22.045 --> 23:24.078
I've never confided this

23:24.080 --> 23:27.247
to anyone.

23:30.750 --> 23:32.717
I consume the worms

23:32.719 --> 23:34.818
to maintain my health.

23:37.488 --> 23:39.322
- You've been eating the worms?

23:39.324 --> 23:42.191
- Well, you can't
ingest them orally.

23:42.193 --> 23:44.726
I discovered
I needed to, uh,

23:44.728 --> 23:47.929
absorb them in solution
through the eyes.

23:53.702 --> 23:56.837
Did you ever see this
number on my arm?

23:56.839 --> 23:59.272
Did it not make you wonder

23:59.274 --> 24:01.340
about my age?

24:01.342 --> 24:06.544
I was a prisoner in
a German death camp in 1944.

24:06.546 --> 24:09.213
I'm 94 years old.

24:09.215 --> 24:11.414
(scoffing)

24:13.350 --> 24:17.419
I need this to keep living.

24:17.421 --> 24:19.954
I've made my choice.

24:19.956 --> 24:21.922
It may be wicked,

24:21.924 --> 24:25.125
it may mean I go to a fiery
and horrible place when I die,

24:25.127 --> 24:29.028
but it's too late to stop now.
I will not stop.

24:30.630 --> 24:33.965
I'm going to win or die
confronting the Master.

24:33.967 --> 24:36.934
I will not

24:36.936 --> 24:40.369
fade away as a weak old man.

24:42.305 --> 24:45.140
- Thank you for telling me.

25:04.159 --> 25:07.094
- He can see me through you,
can't he?

25:07.096 --> 25:10.130
- Yes, he can.

25:12.666 --> 25:14.933
- Is he watching me now?

25:14.935 --> 25:18.569
- You know, I don't know
what he's doing.

25:18.571 --> 25:22.471
- So, reanimated,
you are still

25:22.473 --> 25:25.841
in many ways
who you were before?

25:25.843 --> 25:29.411
- Yeah, especially the part

25:29.413 --> 25:33.781
that gets annoyed when pompous
pricks ask stupid questions.

25:33.783 --> 25:36.683
- Well, this pompous prick

25:36.685 --> 25:39.152
would like you to wait
in the other room.

25:39.154 --> 25:41.687
I will allow you to be here,

25:41.689 --> 25:44.022
but not in here,

25:44.024 --> 25:46.891
or I will do no further work.

25:54.766 --> 25:57.868
- I'll be nearby.

26:10.681 --> 26:13.382
- I'm sorry about
excusing you earlier.

26:13.384 --> 26:17.119
- My instincts tell me

26:17.121 --> 26:20.489
there's a whole layer here
that I'm missing.

26:20.491 --> 26:23.124
- That's your
writer's brain talking.

26:23.126 --> 26:25.826
- No.

26:25.828 --> 26:29.062
When I was younger,
I modeled.

26:29.064 --> 26:32.065
For five years,
all across Europe.

26:32.067 --> 26:34.400
Met a lot of, uh,

26:34.402 --> 26:37.202
bad people,

26:37.204 --> 26:40.572
had to grow up fast.

26:40.574 --> 26:44.509
And I was lucky I didn't make
a horrible mistake.

26:44.511 --> 26:47.879
Because I could have.

26:47.881 --> 26:49.981
Many times.

26:53.719 --> 26:56.821
In my gut,
everything I've learned

26:56.823 --> 26:59.023
makes me think about these men,

26:59.025 --> 27:01.658
Eichhorst and Bolivar,

27:01.660 --> 27:04.761
and wonder if a horrible mistake
isn't being made here.

27:08.165 --> 27:11.667
- Are they good men?
Hardly. Far from it.

27:11.669 --> 27:15.536
But I am more than capable
of handling them.

27:15.538 --> 27:18.839
We are in a very
serious crisis,

27:18.841 --> 27:22.209
and certain things
have to get done.

27:22.211 --> 27:25.545
Things good men won't do.

27:25.547 --> 27:29.181
- Like what? - Well,
let's just leave it at that.

27:29.183 --> 27:32.784
And to the extent that
I can keep you out of it,

27:32.786 --> 27:34.418
I will.

27:34.420 --> 27:36.420
- I don't need to be
kept out of it.

27:36.422 --> 27:40.991
- Trust me. You do.

27:46.263 --> 27:48.264
- Hey, everything OK?

27:48.266 --> 27:50.799
- Yeah, he's much better.
- Good. I was just about to

27:50.801 --> 27:52.867
go over what we've been doing
with Zack.

27:52.869 --> 27:55.402
So last night we went
through several iterations

27:55.404 --> 27:58.438
of the formula to make the
neurotoxins less potent.

27:58.440 --> 28:01.107
- Uh-huh.

28:01.109 --> 28:04.210
- The poison was too strong,

28:04.212 --> 28:06.312
so we lost our first vamp
before it could

28:06.314 --> 28:08.414
spread the disease to
all the others in their nests.

28:08.416 --> 28:11.083
- You mean the lady?

28:11.085 --> 28:15.419
Mrs. McGeever.
- Yeah. That's right.

28:15.421 --> 28:17.988
This is our version
of a plague,

28:17.990 --> 28:21.624
but a good one, one for
all the right reasons.

28:24.894 --> 28:27.595
You never met my dad, Zack.
He was a doctor

28:27.597 --> 28:30.497
in our small town. And he would
let the patients pay

28:30.499 --> 28:33.233
whatever they could,
he made house calls...

28:33.235 --> 28:35.468
And around Christmastime,
patients would just

28:35.470 --> 28:41.006
leave stuff at our front door:
steaks, hand-knitted sweaters,

28:41.008 --> 28:44.075
keg of beer, fruitcake.

28:47.512 --> 28:49.913
I didn't get that much
time with him.

28:54.851 --> 28:57.819
He meant so much
to so many people.

29:03.992 --> 29:06.093
Uh, excuse me.

29:22.309 --> 29:25.044
Yeah, I don't know where
I was going with that.

29:25.046 --> 29:27.513
(glass shattering)

29:34.120 --> 29:36.955
- Hey!
(shattering)

29:36.957 --> 29:40.291
Stop it! Stop it!

29:40.293 --> 29:42.559
Come here, come here.

29:52.736 --> 29:54.737
(rattling breath)
- Let go of me!

29:54.739 --> 29:56.839
(shrieking)
- See that stinger?

29:56.841 --> 29:59.808
If that wasn't covered, it would
shoot into your neck

29:59.810 --> 30:02.710
and drain all the blood
from your body. No -- Zack.

30:02.712 --> 30:04.511
(shrieking)
This is what

30:04.513 --> 30:07.547
your mother is now.
- All right, Eph! Enough!

30:07.549 --> 30:10.683
That's enough.

30:10.685 --> 30:13.285
(vampire rattling and hissing)

30:25.664 --> 30:27.865
- That's a pretty place.

30:27.867 --> 30:31.068
Late Victorian, probably built
right after--

30:31.070 --> 30:33.070
- Please don't tell me the
history of the building.

30:33.072 --> 30:35.072
I'm not in the mood.

30:35.074 --> 30:38.774
- Hey. You're here
for the right reasons.

30:38.776 --> 30:42.744
Good luck.

30:47.782 --> 30:51.651
(dog barking)

30:54.788 --> 30:58.257
(doorbell ringing)

31:06.399 --> 31:09.267
- You put this up?

31:09.269 --> 31:12.103
- Have you heard from her?

31:15.874 --> 31:19.243
- I checked all the hospitals,
I went to the police,

31:19.245 --> 31:22.546
put those pictures up
everywhere.

31:22.548 --> 31:25.148
I never thought I'd miss
the Internet so much.

31:25.150 --> 31:28.085
We're all in the dark.

31:31.489 --> 31:33.490
You knew we weren't
speaking, right?

31:33.492 --> 31:35.925
- Yeah.

31:35.927 --> 31:39.495
- Had she never gotten
involved with you,

31:39.497 --> 31:41.997
she'd be alive.

31:44.767 --> 31:47.001
It makes me sick

31:47.003 --> 31:50.504
to think of all the time
she wasted crying over you.

31:50.506 --> 31:55.041
- Well, if you hear from Nikki,
can you tell her I came by?

31:55.043 --> 31:57.410
I was worried and I'm alive.

31:57.412 --> 32:02.248
- Well, of course you're alive!
You know, Nicola met a vampire

32:02.250 --> 32:04.516
a very long time ago.

32:04.518 --> 32:06.718
She sucked the good

32:06.720 --> 32:09.120
and the spirit out of her.

32:09.122 --> 32:11.255
And after it was all done,
this vampire

32:11.257 --> 32:13.457
didn't even have the decency
to leave.

32:13.459 --> 32:17.594
No, no, no. She stayed around,
haunting her--

32:17.596 --> 32:21.030
- Who do you think took care of
her when you cut the money off?

32:21.032 --> 32:22.931
- Well, I was not about

32:22.933 --> 32:26.534
to funnel money into a lifestyle
that I didn't approve of.

32:26.536 --> 32:29.136
And I am not talking about
the gay thing.

32:29.138 --> 32:31.771
(laughing bitterly)
You and...

32:31.773 --> 32:34.273
your paintings,

32:34.275 --> 32:37.075
you marked her,

32:37.077 --> 32:39.676
and she was never the same.

32:41.979 --> 32:45.881
When you violate
someone's heart that way,

32:45.883 --> 32:48.116
the universe remembers it.

32:49.918 --> 32:53.687
Life's coming for you,
sweetheart. Count on it.

33:01.595 --> 33:03.562
- (woman on radio):<i> The mayor and
Councilwoman Feraldo had</i> <i> an</i>

33:03.564 --> 33:05.730
important announcement today.
- (Feraldo):<i> Staten Island</i>

33:05.732 --> 33:07.998
<i> is a plague-free zone.</i>

33:08.000 --> 33:10.567
- Amen to that, girl.
- (man):<i> And in related news,</i>

33:10.569 --> 33:12.835
<i> gas lines, curfews... </i>
- That's what I'm talking about.

33:12.837 --> 33:16.171
This councilwoman's
got balls, huh?

33:16.173 --> 33:18.306
She's kicking ass out there
in Staten Island.

33:18.308 --> 33:22.642
(screaming)
(slamming)

33:22.644 --> 33:25.745
(sobbing)
- Hey, hey, hey...

33:25.747 --> 33:27.846
Tell me.

33:29.748 --> 33:32.649
- She thinks Nikki's dead.

33:32.651 --> 33:36.319
- And you don't?

33:36.321 --> 33:38.921
- She thinks it's my fault.

33:38.923 --> 33:41.123
- Oh, well, screw her.

33:41.125 --> 33:43.358
You want me to go tell her
you're innocent?

33:43.360 --> 33:46.694
- I'm not.

33:46.696 --> 33:48.996
I never have been.

33:48.998 --> 33:53.400
- Yeah, you're such
a horrible person.

34:11.985 --> 34:14.219
- I don't know...
I don't know how that bitch

34:14.221 --> 34:16.988
gave birth to someone
so lovely.

34:16.990 --> 34:20.558
- We should get going.

34:20.560 --> 34:23.026
- No.
- Yeah?

34:25.062 --> 34:29.031
(unzipping)
Uh... Or not.

34:29.033 --> 34:31.199
- She's right about me.

34:31.201 --> 34:33.000
- What's that, some kind
of warning?

34:33.002 --> 34:36.870
- I've already warned you.

34:44.378 --> 34:46.779
(croaking and rattling)

35:07.267 --> 35:10.969
- So the Master can see through
all you things, huh?

35:15.607 --> 35:19.776
Are you watching me now?

35:25.448 --> 35:28.916
(bottle clattering)

35:31.185 --> 35:33.386
(chair rolling)

35:33.388 --> 35:35.388
You took my wife.

35:35.390 --> 35:38.324
My son's mother.

35:40.794 --> 35:43.128
I'm gonna take hundreds,

35:43.130 --> 35:45.396
thousands of yours.

35:45.398 --> 35:48.866
I'm gonna work my way

35:48.868 --> 35:51.201
all the way to the top --

35:51.203 --> 35:53.303
to you.

35:53.305 --> 35:57.540
Hey! My eyes are up here.
(snapping)

36:06.749 --> 36:09.117
You planning on sending

36:09.119 --> 36:13.220
my vampire wife after my boy?
Here's the deal,

36:13.222 --> 36:17.123
Master.

36:19.426 --> 36:21.627
I will kill him

36:21.629 --> 36:24.329
and then I'll kill myself

36:24.331 --> 36:28.299
before I let you turn us into
anything like you.

36:44.915 --> 36:46.749
- Hey, what's up, brother?

36:46.751 --> 36:48.751
I'm here to, uh,
inspect the elevator.

36:48.753 --> 36:51.253
- ID, please.
- Oh, yeah, no problem.

36:54.757 --> 36:57.191
- I'm gonna grab my stuff.
Is that cool?

37:04.098 --> 37:07.467
Hey, uh, can you do me a favor?
Can you grab this side for me?

37:07.469 --> 37:10.369
It's kinda heavy. Little more.

37:10.371 --> 37:12.504
Thanks, man.

37:16.442 --> 37:19.177
- You're only the third vendor
making calls today.

37:19.179 --> 37:21.312
- Yeah, man, I got
12 other stops to make

37:21.314 --> 37:24.281
after this. All kind of shit
breaking down everywhere.

37:24.283 --> 37:27.550
- I hear you. This way.

37:29.452 --> 37:31.386
- To the right?
- This way.

37:31.388 --> 37:33.688
- I'll be in and out quick.
(tires screeching)

37:33.690 --> 37:35.656
- You hear about
that councilwoman

37:35.658 --> 37:38.358
out in Staten Island?
Said the place is clean now.

37:38.360 --> 37:40.793
Guess that means
no more vampires.

37:40.795 --> 37:42.961
- Nah, I didn't hear that.

37:42.963 --> 37:45.363
I've been too busy dealing with
all this shit, you know?

37:45.365 --> 37:47.565
- She's changing things.

37:47.567 --> 37:49.700
We're gonna win this thing.

37:49.702 --> 37:53.236
- I'm planning on it.

38:01.478 --> 38:05.447
- We got an outside contractor.
Let's keep eyes on him.

38:11.352 --> 38:14.220
(beeping)

38:27.433 --> 38:29.534
- Access to the elevator
equipment

38:29.536 --> 38:31.502
is around to the left.
- Hey, hold on real quick.

38:31.504 --> 38:32.903
I gotta check a few things
here first,

38:32.905 --> 38:34.237
if that's all right with you.

38:34.239 --> 38:36.772
- Like what?
- Just routine stuff, man.

38:36.774 --> 38:39.107
I gotta update the sensors
every two years.

38:39.109 --> 38:41.675
Not a big deal.
(beeping)

38:44.345 --> 38:47.747
(loud boom)
- What was that?

39:22.715 --> 39:25.383
(beeping)

39:25.385 --> 39:27.451
- What the hell?

39:27.453 --> 39:29.486
- Perry, we show elevator one
heading for the penthouse.

39:29.488 --> 39:31.554
Are you with that
maintenance guy?

39:31.556 --> 39:36.124
Perry, do you have eyes
on the maintenance guy?

39:36.126 --> 39:38.759
- All right, keep trying him.
We've got a situation.

39:38.761 --> 39:40.494
Let's go get the man.

39:40.496 --> 39:42.496
- Well, that seems
a possibility.

39:42.498 --> 39:44.998
- I certainly think so.
- Oh, excuse me...

39:45.000 --> 39:48.001
- Sir, we have a Code One.
- I'm sorry for the disruption.

39:48.003 --> 39:50.136
- Mr. Palmer, thank you
for the meeting.

39:50.138 --> 39:53.005
- You do good work, sir.
God bless you.

39:53.007 --> 39:56.341
- We must all stick together.
Thank you for coming. No!

39:56.343 --> 39:58.843
She stays with me.
- Very well, sir.

40:07.318 --> 40:09.852
- Come on.
(groaning)

40:09.854 --> 40:13.021
You know, I used to know
some guys

40:13.023 --> 40:15.156
who used to ghost-ride
elevators in the projects.

40:15.158 --> 40:21.195
- How'd that work out for 'em?
- How do you think? Let's go...

40:25.433 --> 40:29.335
- Everybody ready? Let's go.

40:31.538 --> 40:33.605
- (Gus): There's nobody here.

40:33.607 --> 40:36.341
- It appears we have
six intruders -- how did

40:36.343 --> 40:39.410
something like this happen?
- I don't know, sir.

40:49.020 --> 40:52.121
- Break down the door.

40:54.390 --> 40:57.258
- Wait.

41:00.629 --> 41:03.931
- I never wanted this to happen.

41:05.633 --> 41:10.336
(beeping)
(sizzling and shrieking)

41:10.338 --> 41:13.005
- UV light!
(lights humming)

41:13.007 --> 41:16.541
(firing)

41:16.543 --> 41:19.243
(shrieking)
(sizzling)

41:30.254 --> 41:33.889
(platform clanking)
(shrieking)

41:38.995 --> 41:41.863
- Come on! Give me your hand!
Come on!

41:41.865 --> 41:43.030
I'll shield you from the light!
Get up!

41:43.032 --> 41:44.664
- Go! I can't be saved!

41:44.666 --> 41:46.298
- What are you talking about?
Come on, get up!

41:46.300 --> 41:50.068
- We need you! Get out!
- I'm outta here.

41:56.708 --> 41:59.843
(beep)

42:06.150 --> 42:08.551
- What's this? Pasta night?

42:08.553 --> 42:11.453
That's good 'cause we've worked
up quite an appetite.

42:11.455 --> 42:13.988
- "We've"?

42:13.990 --> 42:16.156
- I never grow tired

42:16.158 --> 42:18.525
of your flirtatious badinage.

42:18.527 --> 42:21.861
- Someone's feeling better, huh?

42:25.131 --> 42:27.232
- You look different.

42:27.234 --> 42:29.634
- My dear, I believe

42:29.636 --> 42:32.703
I've gotten my second wind.

42:34.739 --> 42:37.741
- Hey!

42:37.743 --> 42:40.577
- I was just trying
to get through to him.

42:40.579 --> 42:42.879
Do you think it worked?
- I do.

42:42.881 --> 42:46.549
But you'll never win with your
son when it comes to his mother.

42:46.551 --> 42:50.586
It's that simple.
(banging and rattling)

42:50.588 --> 42:54.522
(low growl)
- Is he gonna die on us?

42:54.524 --> 42:58.826
(camera clicking)

42:58.828 --> 43:00.928
- There's less swelling,

43:00.930 --> 43:03.897
but he's fully infected.

43:07.201 --> 43:10.869
But I don't think he's dying.
- In other words...

43:10.871 --> 43:13.571
we did it.

43:17.275 --> 43:19.909
- When do we test
transmission?

43:19.911 --> 43:22.244
- Tonight.

43:24.680 --> 43:26.981
We cut him loose.

43:33.888 --> 43:36.455
