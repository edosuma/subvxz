Well, neither do I.

09:48.120 --> 09:49.480
I mean, I'm a dinosaur.

09:49.550 --> 09:52.750
My arms too short to grab tools.

09:52.820 --> 09:54.420
[ROARING]

09:59.820 --> 10:02.400
Okay, here comes another one.

10:03.980 --> 10:07.120
Oh! Ten in a row!

10:07.140 --> 10:08.700
You're amazing.

10:08.770 --> 10:10.270
Are you just saying that?

10:10.340 --> 10:11.470
No, you are.

10:11.500 --> 10:13.480
I mean, you caught ten baseballs

10:13.500 --> 10:14.780
and the butterfly.

10:14.840 --> 10:18.550
Who I'm sure will one day
make a full recovery.

10:18.610 --> 10:21.860
Oh, hey, Calvin, how's it going?

10:21.900 --> 10:24.450
It's going great for me. I'm
going to the scrapyard.

10:24.520 --> 10:26.190
Are you guys done?

10:26.260 --> 10:27.319
I quit.

10:27.320 --> 10:29.999
Malcolm says he can do it with YouTube.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.030
Can he?

10:31.090 --> 10:32.230
You better hope so.

10:32.300 --> 10:34.060
I bet-I better hope so?

10:34.130 --> 10:36.600
Uh, c-can you watch Grover for a second?

10:36.670 --> 10:37.880
Oh, and, um,

10:37.890 --> 10:41.640
if he asks, the
butterfly's taking a nap.

10:45.440 --> 10:46.710
Want to play catch?

10:46.780 --> 10:48.940
Sure. You any good?

10:49.010 --> 10:51.610
- I'm amazing.
- [CHUCKLES]

10:51.680 --> 10:53.739
Eh, you got a lot of swag

10:53.740 --> 10:55.940
for a kid named after a Muppet.

10:55.960 --> 10:58.460
All right, little man.

10:58.540 --> 11:00.150
G-Go on back, get ready.

11:00.220 --> 11:01.820
Let's see what you got.

11:01.890 --> 11:03.319
- Okay. You ready?
- Yeah.

11:03.320 --> 11:06.060
All right, here it goes.

11:06.130 --> 11:08.300
- Oh...
- Ow!

11:11.170 --> 11:15.100

11:42.230 --> 11:43.670
I came to pick up my laundry, and...

11:43.730 --> 11:46.200
[SHOUTS] Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

[EXHALING]: Okay...

12:22.140 --> 12:23.500
So you're not mad?

12:23.570 --> 12:25.310
Of course not.

12:25.370 --> 12:27.370
Nobody can resist Lola.

12:27.440 --> 12:28.710
You named her?

12:28.780 --> 12:30.710
I name all my girls.

12:35.990 --> 12:38.520
This is even better than the washcloth.

12:40.990 --> 12:43.220
Can we be done playing catch?

12:43.290 --> 12:46.760
Done? We haven't started playing catch.

12:46.830 --> 12:50.760
So far, we've just been playing miss.

12:50.830 --> 12:53.200
[CHUCKLES] Let me show you
something, all right?

12:53.270 --> 12:55.740
See, now, this is the best part.

12:55.810 --> 12:57.840
You get to eat it.

12:57.960 --> 13:00.120
I want to quit baseball.

13:00.190 --> 13:03.260
Why? Just because you got hit one time?

13:03.330 --> 13:05.500
How many times do I have to get hit?

13:07.630 --> 13:10.570
Look, trust me, you don't want to quit.

13:10.640 --> 13:13.270
All right? Then you'll go
through life just being a punk.

13:13.340 --> 13:14.510
What's a punk?

13:14.570 --> 13:16.270
Well, someone who quits things

13:16.340 --> 13:17.470
when they get hard.

13:17.540 --> 13:20.510
Oh. So you're a punk.

13:22.260 --> 13:23.659
You know, I'm-a chalk that up to you

13:23.660 --> 13:25.660
getting hit in the head.

13:26.220 --> 13:28.290
I mean, because you
quit fixing the pipe.

13:28.350 --> 13:30.790
Well, that's different. You know...

13:30.860 --> 13:32.260
How?

13:54.080 --> 13:55.880
You okay?

13:55.950 --> 13:57.820
That went inside my mouth.

13:59.520 --> 14:02.320
[SIGHS] I thought we had it this time.

14:02.390 --> 14:06.120
You know what, I can't do this, Dave.

14:06.190 --> 14:07.490
You should call a plumber.

14:07.560 --> 14:09.960
W-What? What are you talking about?

14:10.030 --> 14:11.960
We're so close.

14:12.030 --> 14:13.459
You know, look, let's
just take a breather,

14:13.460 --> 14:14.529
and we'll try again.

14:14.530 --> 14:16.470
No, I don't know why I
thought I could fix this.

14:16.540 --> 14:18.240
You know, guess my dad was right.

14:18.300 --> 14:20.840
I guess I do take the easy way out.

14:20.910 --> 14:25.080
Well, taking the easy way out
is what you're doing right now.

14:25.140 --> 14:26.880
And what's that supposed to mean?

14:26.980 --> 14:28.650
Well, you're quitting,

14:28.710 --> 14:31.120
even though you are so close.

14:31.180 --> 14:32.896
And you have all the tools
you need right here.

14:32.920 --> 14:35.250
You're just, you're missing one thing.

14:38.960 --> 14:41.090
Your confidence.

14:41.160 --> 14:43.560

14:43.630 --> 14:46.760
Dave, how corny can you get?

14:46.840 --> 14:48.730
Well, I'd show you, but...

14:48.800 --> 14:52.000
I'd need both hands.

14:56.980 --> 15:00.180
Mm.

15:00.250 --> 15:02.550
You know who grew up
in this neighborhood?

15:02.620 --> 15:04.180
Jackie Robinson.

15:04.250 --> 15:05.350
Who's that?

15:05.420 --> 15:06.950
"Who is that?"

15:07.020 --> 15:10.020
What do they teach you kids at school?

15:10.090 --> 15:13.090
This week, we learned a new yoga pose.

15:13.160 --> 15:15.790
Wow.

15:15.860 --> 15:19.630
Every child left behind.

15:19.700 --> 15:21.690
Well, Jackie Robinson was

15:21.700 --> 15:24.400
the first black baseball player
to play in the major leagues.

15:24.470 --> 15:26.100
Now, had he been a quitter,

15:26.170 --> 15:28.440
the sport wouldn't be what it is today.

15:28.510 --> 15:30.810
Did you know Jackie Robinson?

15:30.880 --> 15:33.480
How old do you think I am?

15:33.550 --> 15:37.310
I don't know. A lot?

15:39.650 --> 15:44.420
Look, my point is, nothing
worthwhile in life comes easy.

15:44.490 --> 15:46.420
You know, Malcolm and I, we used to

15:46.490 --> 15:48.430
stay out here till it got dark,

15:48.490 --> 15:51.800
you know, just throwing
the ball back and forth.

15:51.860 --> 15:53.900
Turned him into a
pretty good ballplayer.

15:53.970 --> 15:55.830
Am I a pretty good ballplayer?

15:55.900 --> 15:57.400
No, you straight trash.

15:58.870 --> 16:01.610
Now, come on, man.

16:01.670 --> 16:05.510
I'm just saying, if you keep
practicing, you can get better.

16:05.580 --> 16:08.110
Maybe I could be the
next Jackie Robinson.

16:08.180 --> 16:11.620
Sure. Yeah, you'll open
doors of opportunity

16:11.640 --> 16:13.150
to white men everywhere.

16:15.020 --> 16:17.020
Come on, man, let's get
back to playing baseball.

16:17.090 --> 16:18.220
Let's do it.

16:18.320 --> 16:20.220
This time, can I try hitting?

16:20.320 --> 16:21.460
Sure.

16:21.530 --> 16:24.830
Couldn't be much worse
than your catching.

16:24.900 --> 16:26.960
All right.

16:27.030 --> 16:28.600
I want you to set up now.

16:28.670 --> 16:30.270
I'm gonna toss the ball to you,

16:30.340 --> 16:32.500
and I want you to swing hard, all right?

16:32.570 --> 16:34.510
Swing like a man, not a mouse.

16:34.570 --> 16:36.470
- All right.
- You ready?

16:36.540 --> 16:37.840
Here we go.

Get me another popsicle.

16:44.920 --> 16:47.700
Oh, my God.

16:47.720 --> 16:49.450

man in the mirror.

16:59.970 --> 17:02.570
Oh, you know what? That
is your daddy's favorite.

17:02.640 --> 17:04.450
As a matter of fact, I
think I was wearing that

17:04.470 --> 17:05.640
the night we made you.

17:05.700 --> 17:09.210

17:09.280 --> 17:10.810
This is so fun.

17:10.880 --> 17:12.180
I needed a good laugh.

17:12.240 --> 17:13.940
Oh, if you really want a laugh,

17:14.020 --> 17:17.310
you got to try on Kiki.

17:17.380 --> 17:21.150
I totally wanted to, but I
wasn't sure if it was okay.

17:21.170 --> 17:24.520
Oh, sure, but first, you got
to say Black Lives Matter.

17:24.589 --> 17:28.160
Of course Black Lives Matter.

17:28.230 --> 17:30.190
Boy, stop messing with her.

17:30.260 --> 17:33.100
He's joking. But good answer, girl.

- Ah!

written all over it.

18:03.660 --> 18:05.470
So how'd things go with Grover?

18:05.500 --> 18:06.530
What did you guys do?

18:06.650 --> 18:09.420
Well, we continued to
work on his catching.

18:09.490 --> 18:11.450
And then he hit a double.

18:11.520 --> 18:13.290
Really?

18:13.360 --> 18:16.860
Yeah, one inch to the left,
it would've been a triple.

18:16.930 --> 18:21.430
Well, we just finished up,
and... check this out.

18:21.440 --> 18:23.330
Malcolm did an incredible job.

18:24.700 --> 18:26.600
Hmm.

18:31.540 --> 18:33.540
Yeah, it's a'ight.

18:33.610 --> 18:35.880
DAVE: I think it's a little bit

18:35.940 --> 18:37.556
- better than that.
- MALCOLM: Oh, no, no.

18:37.580 --> 18:39.510
That's cool. "A'ight" is my Dad's way

18:39.580 --> 18:42.150
of saying I did a great job and
he's sorry he can't say that

18:42.220 --> 18:44.820
so he says "a'ight."

18:44.890 --> 18:46.220
A'ight.

Hey, I'll come back tomorrow and
help you patch up that hole.

Oh, yeah. Great. Uh,
w-what do I owe you?

18:52.130 --> 18:54.010
Oh, nothing, man. The thing
is, we're neighbors.

18:54.030 --> 18:55.160
Next time, you get me.

19:00.470 --> 19:01.900
Did you see that?

19:01.970 --> 19:03.700
Yeah. I just saw my broke son

19:03.810 --> 19:05.910
turn down perfectly good money.

19:05.970 --> 19:09.350
Really? Because I just saw somebody

19:09.380 --> 19:11.810
who must've been raised
by a pretty good dad.

19:18.700 --> 19:21.490
I mean, Tina did have a little
something to do with it,

19:21.500 --> 19:23.160
I guess.

19:23.230 --> 19:25.750
So Grover's starting to
get better at baseball?

19:25.780 --> 19:26.840
What'd you do?

19:26.880 --> 19:28.100
Well, I stopped

19:28.160 --> 19:30.530
telling him he was amazing,
and made him earn it.

19:32.020 --> 19:34.230
I could probably do a
little bit more of that.

19:34.300 --> 19:35.900
- Mm-hmm.
- Although,

19:35.970 --> 19:39.870
a little positive reinforcement
never hurt, either.

Yeah, maybe not.
