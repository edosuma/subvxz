WEBVTT

00:08.575 --> 00:09.975
Why are we here?

00:10.042 --> 00:12.945
So, you know all those female
problems I've been having,

00:13.012 --> 00:14.050
the cramps,
the heavy bleeding...

00:14.080 --> 00:16.982
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:17.049 --> 00:22.387
They're caused by a large
fibroid tumor on my uterus.

00:23.956 --> 00:25.556
A tumor?

00:25.624 --> 00:27.960
I'm afraid Jill's gonna
need a hysterectomy.

00:28.027 --> 00:30.566
You're just talking about a partial
hysterectomy, right? Not a total?

00:30.596 --> 00:34.599
There...
There is a "totalrectomy"?

00:34.734 --> 00:37.574
If you take my ovaries, then that's
gonna throw me into early menopause.

00:37.604 --> 00:40.639
I'm really... I am not ready for
hot flashes and mood swings.

00:40.706 --> 00:42.874
I know you're not.
Jill, at this point,

00:42.942 --> 00:45.243
I see no reason that I'd
have to take your ovaries.

00:46.412 --> 00:47.479
Are you ready,
Mrs. Taylor?

00:47.546 --> 00:48.580
No.

00:48.648 --> 00:50.348
Yeah, you are.
You'll be fine.

00:50.416 --> 00:53.451
At 9:00, you'll be out,
good as new. You will, honey.

00:53.519 --> 00:55.587
- I love you.
- I love you, honey.

00:55.655 --> 00:57.622
I'll be waiting
for you right here.

00:57.690 --> 01:00.258
The doctor said this procedure
was an hour and a half.

01:00.326 --> 01:03.028
We're going into two hours
and 47 minutes now.

01:03.162 --> 01:06.164
Well, I wouldn't be alarmed.
Surgeries are often delayed.

01:06.299 --> 01:07.799
I hope that's it.

01:07.867 --> 01:09.100
Give me some O chromic.

01:09.168 --> 01:10.602
We've got a problem here.

01:10.670 --> 01:13.538
Her vitals are all over the place.
She's going into shock.

01:18.711 --> 01:22.147
Why don't you just sit down
and have a cup of coffee?

01:22.214 --> 01:25.416
Because I'm going crazy. And I still
don't know what's going on with my wife.

01:25.585 --> 01:27.953
Well, we're all
concerned, Mr. Wong.

01:31.156 --> 01:32.991
Do I look like
Mr. Wong to you?

01:33.058 --> 01:35.093
I'm Mr. Taylor.

01:35.160 --> 01:37.629
I'm sorry. This waiting
is just driving me crazy.

01:37.697 --> 01:41.165
Oh, and I understand. When my
husband Harold went in for surgery,

01:41.233 --> 01:43.735
they said it was only
gonna take three hours.

01:43.803 --> 01:45.136
How long did it eventually take?

01:45.204 --> 01:47.272
15 hours.

01:47.440 --> 01:49.607
Oh, but that included
the autopsy.

01:54.881 --> 01:56.714
I feel a lot better now.
Thank you.

02:02.455 --> 02:04.356
- Hey!
- Oh, sorry, Tim.

02:04.424 --> 02:06.362
Hey. What's going on? It's been three
hours. Tell me what's happening.

02:06.392 --> 02:07.530
Well, we had
a few complications.

02:07.560 --> 02:09.328
What do you mean,
"complications"?

02:09.395 --> 02:11.201
She had an allergic reaction to the
antibiotic and she went into shock.

02:11.231 --> 02:12.264
She's in shock?

02:12.332 --> 02:13.798
No, no, no,
she's gonna be just fine.

02:13.866 --> 02:16.635
We were able to stabilize her.
There's no reason for concern.

02:16.703 --> 02:17.703
So she's okay then?

02:17.770 --> 02:19.404
Yeah, absolutely.

02:19.472 --> 02:22.641
But, unfortunately, I did find
dermoid cysts twisting her ovaries.

02:22.709 --> 02:24.576
Now the cysts
themselves are benign.

02:25.778 --> 02:28.213
But I'm afraid I had
to remove her ovaries.

02:29.849 --> 02:31.149
So she had a total hysterectomy?

02:31.217 --> 02:33.552
Yeah. Sorry.

02:33.620 --> 02:34.757
I just didn't have any choice.

02:34.787 --> 02:36.388
Oh, boy.

02:36.456 --> 02:38.189
What was her reaction
when she found out?

02:38.258 --> 02:39.725
Well, she doesn't know yet.

02:39.792 --> 02:41.226
Oh, boy.

02:41.294 --> 02:42.694
Do we have to tell her?

02:44.864 --> 02:47.632
I think we do.

02:47.700 --> 02:50.702
I'll stop in and talk to her when she's
out of recovery in her regular room.

02:50.770 --> 02:51.837
All right.

02:51.904 --> 02:53.471
- You okay?
- Yeah, thanks, thanks.

02:55.140 --> 02:57.008
- Mr. Taylor?
- Yeah?

02:57.075 --> 02:59.081
Your wife's out of surgery
and the doctor will be out

02:59.111 --> 03:01.012
to talk to you in a few minutes.

03:03.000 --> 03:09.074

03:53.966 --> 03:56.735
Hey, boys, it's Dad.
Mom is A-okay.

03:56.802 --> 03:58.641
When you get home from school,
I want you to give her a call.

03:58.671 --> 04:00.108
Tell her that you love her
or something like that.

04:00.138 --> 04:02.807
But make her think
it was your idea.

04:02.875 --> 04:05.309
Make sure you erase
this message. Gotta go, bye.

04:07.179 --> 04:08.580
Look who's back.

04:10.115 --> 04:11.215
Hey.

04:12.317 --> 04:13.685
How you feeling?

04:13.753 --> 04:15.487
Like hell.

04:15.554 --> 04:18.189
Well, you wouldn't
know to look at you.

04:18.257 --> 04:20.291
I'm sure.

04:20.358 --> 04:21.559
Anything I can do to help?

04:21.627 --> 04:24.228
Yeah, stand back.
I've seen <i>Tool Time.</i>

04:30.536 --> 04:32.704
Have you seen the doctor?

04:32.772 --> 04:34.171
Yeah. Briefly.

04:35.240 --> 04:37.376
What did he say?

04:37.443 --> 04:39.749
He wanted... He was gonna talk to you
as soon as you got back to the room.

04:39.779 --> 04:41.279
Where is the doctor?

04:41.347 --> 04:44.215
He's delivering a baby. But he'll
be here as soon as he's done.

04:44.217 --> 04:45.783
Can I have some water, please?

04:45.851 --> 04:48.687
Not just yet. But I'll get
you some ice you can chew on.

04:48.754 --> 04:50.255
How did the surgery go?

04:50.322 --> 04:51.322
Uh...

04:53.092 --> 04:55.127
Did it go exactly as planned?

04:57.697 --> 04:59.998
How long can it take
to deliver a darn baby?

05:03.435 --> 05:04.903
He took my ovaries?

05:06.672 --> 05:08.139
He said there was
no choice, honey.

05:08.307 --> 05:09.407
Oh, God!

05:10.076 --> 05:11.409
I have cancer?

05:11.476 --> 05:14.545
No, no, no, no. No, no.
You have "twisted sisters."

05:20.920 --> 05:22.086
What?

05:24.222 --> 05:26.724
What is that? What, you
just mean twisted cysts?

05:26.892 --> 05:30.295
Cysts, yes. And they're benign.
So everything is good.

05:31.397 --> 05:33.598
I can't believe it.

05:33.665 --> 05:37.135
He took everything.
I'm gutted like a fish.

05:37.202 --> 05:40.271
Oh, no! We don't look at it that way.
You had surgery.

05:40.339 --> 05:43.474
You had your radiator flushed.
You're gonna be running cool now.

05:44.744 --> 05:46.711
I'm not a car, Tim.

05:48.014 --> 05:49.981
I'm only 42 years old.

05:50.049 --> 05:53.952
I'm gonna go through menopause
10 years before I'm supposed to.

05:54.019 --> 05:57.255
You start early, you know. The
early bird catches the worm.

05:58.357 --> 05:59.390
Honey.

06:04.964 --> 06:07.131
It's hard to tell
what flavor this Jell-O is.

06:07.199 --> 06:08.966
It's either lime or guacamole.

06:12.204 --> 06:14.238
Honey, can you get
me that laptop?

06:14.306 --> 06:16.875
I gotta start working
on the thesis.

06:16.942 --> 06:20.311
Honey, you just had surgery yesterday.
Are you sure this is a good idea?

06:20.379 --> 06:22.981
I don't have a choice.
It's due.

06:23.048 --> 06:24.181
I'm gonna get you the tray.

06:25.450 --> 06:26.618
- Hi, Jill!
- Hi!

06:26.685 --> 06:28.319
Hey, guys.
Hope it's not a bad time.

06:29.855 --> 06:32.424
Not at all. Not at all.

06:32.492 --> 06:34.058
I brought you these.

06:34.126 --> 06:36.660
Oh, they are so beautiful.

06:36.728 --> 06:38.696
And I brought you these!

06:40.632 --> 06:42.767
Oh, Al.

06:42.835 --> 06:45.503
<i>What does he think
this is? A grand opening?</i>

06:47.573 --> 06:51.843
Balloons really cheered up my mother
when she had her hysterectomy.

06:51.911 --> 06:55.012
<i>Please, God, take me now!</i>

06:57.416 --> 06:59.584
When did your mom
have a hysterectomy?

06:59.652 --> 07:01.185
While she was
in her mid-50s.

07:01.254 --> 07:04.889
And she did not react
well to "the change."

07:04.957 --> 07:06.596
But with the help
of hormonal supplements,

07:06.626 --> 07:08.627
she bounced right back.

07:08.794 --> 07:10.928
Put a heck of a dent
in the earth's crust.

07:13.432 --> 07:16.468
I'll go find a vase
for the flowers.

07:16.536 --> 07:18.603
Yeah, you know, taking estrogen,

07:18.671 --> 07:22.006
you know, really helped mother's
hot flashes and her mood swings.

07:22.074 --> 07:23.941
And the side effects
were minimal.

07:24.210 --> 07:26.978
I mean, you know, some
irritability and minor bloating.

07:29.715 --> 07:32.050
Here, I'll get that.

07:32.117 --> 07:33.785
Well, you look great, Jill.

07:33.852 --> 07:36.854
It's hard to believe you just went
through major surgery, you know?

07:36.922 --> 07:38.056
- Really?
- Yeah.

07:38.123 --> 07:39.724
Thanks.

07:41.593 --> 07:46.230
<i>Oh, for God's sake!
Put the coat back on!</i>

07:46.298 --> 07:48.867
<i>I can't believe I have to look at
this perfect young fertile body</i>

07:48.934 --> 07:51.736
<i>while I'm laying up here
like a dried-up old prune.</i>

07:54.373 --> 07:57.108
Now my Aunt Martha,
she didn't take the hormones

07:57.176 --> 07:58.877
and she grew a goatee.

08:00.312 --> 08:03.614
On both her chins.

08:03.682 --> 08:07.452
<i>Not a jury in the land
would convict me.</i>

08:09.588 --> 08:11.790
Hey, honey. Good news.
Got another visitor.

08:11.857 --> 08:14.625
And we can stay all day.

08:14.727 --> 08:17.362
<i>At least the bear doesn't talk.</i>

08:19.665 --> 08:22.934
<i>Get well soon. Get well soon.</i>

08:28.607 --> 08:30.141
Welcome home.

08:31.343 --> 08:34.245
I'm so glad to be home.

08:34.313 --> 08:36.280
It feels like it's
been about a month.

08:36.347 --> 08:38.787
Yeah. That's because it took us a
month to get home from the hospital.

08:38.817 --> 08:42.453
Dad, did you have to drive
two miles an hour?

08:42.520 --> 08:45.423
Your mom just had major surgery.
I was being cautious.

08:45.491 --> 08:47.791
Yeah, I always wondered
what it would take.

08:49.828 --> 08:52.096
Thanks.

08:52.164 --> 08:55.166
What, you brought the spit
things back from the hospital?

08:56.602 --> 08:58.302
They expect you
to take something.

08:58.370 --> 08:59.650
It's like when
you go to a hotel,

08:59.705 --> 09:01.745
you take the little soaps
and the bedroom furniture.

09:02.508 --> 09:03.909
We're home.

09:03.976 --> 09:06.044
Who are you talking to?

09:06.112 --> 09:08.779
Mom? What are
you doing here?

09:08.848 --> 09:11.382
Well, when Tim told me
you had surgery,

09:11.450 --> 09:14.418
there was no way
I was gonna stay at home.

09:14.486 --> 09:16.888
I'm so glad you're here.

09:16.956 --> 09:19.724
Why didn't you tell me
she was coming?

09:19.791 --> 09:21.559
I wanted to surprise you.

09:25.231 --> 09:28.032
You are so incredibly sweet.

09:28.100 --> 09:30.268
Yes, I am.

09:30.335 --> 09:33.704
And so are my boys. God!

09:33.773 --> 09:37.175
Mom, do you know that the second
that they got home from school,

09:37.243 --> 09:39.410
they called the hospital to
tell me that they love me?

09:39.478 --> 09:42.346
Have you ever heard of such
caring and sensitive teenagers?

09:45.083 --> 09:46.618
Yeah, as soon as
we walked in the door,

09:46.685 --> 09:49.587
it was like, there was this
voice saying, "Call your mom."

09:54.426 --> 09:58.029
Why don't you two caring, sensitive teens
take your mom's stuff up to her room?

09:58.830 --> 10:00.031
Thanks, guys.

10:00.098 --> 10:01.399
- Thanks.
- Okay, sweetie.

10:01.467 --> 10:04.769
Now come over here and
sit down and talk to me.

10:17.349 --> 10:19.116
So how are you feeling?

10:19.185 --> 10:20.685
Better.

10:20.752 --> 10:24.322
Well, now, you just don't push it.
You have to take it easy

10:24.390 --> 10:26.491
and give yourself
time to recover.

10:26.558 --> 10:28.760
Mom, I don't have
time to take it easy.

10:28.828 --> 10:30.228
I gotta finish my thesis.

10:30.295 --> 10:32.696
Tim, can you find my book
bag over there somewhere?

10:32.698 --> 10:35.266
Hey, I've got great
news on that front.

10:35.334 --> 10:37.768
If you liked me before,
you're gonna love me now.

10:37.836 --> 10:40.771
I've got you an extension
on your thesis.

10:40.839 --> 10:42.673
- You what?
- Yeah.

10:42.741 --> 10:44.547
Talked to your advisor, told
him about your hysterectomy.

10:44.577 --> 10:46.177
He gave you an extra week.

10:47.412 --> 10:48.813
You what?

10:50.115 --> 10:52.149
I'm not feeling the love.

10:57.123 --> 10:59.324
You told him?

10:59.391 --> 11:01.559
I can't believe it!
I'm so...

11:01.627 --> 11:04.162
Tim, if I had wanted my advisor
to know about the hysterectomy,

11:04.230 --> 11:05.968
I would have told him.
How could you do this to me?

11:05.998 --> 11:08.318
- Well, honey, don't bite his head off...
- Mother, please!

11:09.268 --> 11:12.270
I don't need him
to get me an extension.

11:12.338 --> 11:18.209
I don't need Wilson to tell me
about menopause on the <i>Mayflower!</i>

11:18.277 --> 11:21.346
I don't need Heidi flaunting
her perfect boobs in my face!

11:21.413 --> 11:27.518
And I most especially don't need Al
comparing me to his bearded aunt! God!

11:29.888 --> 11:31.889
Let the mood swings begin.

11:40.165 --> 11:41.232
Whoo-hoo!

11:41.900 --> 11:43.000
Hi.

11:43.068 --> 11:45.836
I brought you a surprise.

11:47.038 --> 11:49.473
Oh, Mom!

11:49.541 --> 11:52.577
You made your
special bread pudding.

11:52.644 --> 11:56.046
Well, when you were a little girl,
it always made you feel better.

11:59.151 --> 12:02.019
Bread pudding's so good.

12:02.087 --> 12:03.921
What was that secret
ingredient you use?

12:03.989 --> 12:05.623
Bread.

12:07.625 --> 12:09.593
Hey, I thought maybe
you'd like some cold milk

12:09.661 --> 12:11.462
to go with your bread pudding.

12:11.529 --> 12:13.164
Thank you, sweetheart.

12:13.232 --> 12:14.303
Sounds like she's
feeling better.

12:14.333 --> 12:16.800
Mama's home cooking
works every time.

12:24.276 --> 12:27.578
This is whole milk. What,
are you trying to kill me?

12:27.645 --> 12:30.681
No. But I could see how
you could think that way.

12:33.451 --> 12:37.021
This is full of
fat and calories.

12:37.089 --> 12:39.256
It's no worse than your
mother's bread pudding.

12:40.025 --> 12:42.060
Damn!

12:42.127 --> 12:43.828
How could you let her
make this for me?

12:43.896 --> 12:45.935
There's like a pound of butter
in here and a dozen eggs.

12:45.965 --> 12:48.771
If it doesn't give me a heart attack, it's
gonna turn me into a big, old, fat sow.

12:48.801 --> 12:50.134
Is it hot in here?

12:50.202 --> 12:51.903
- I don't think so.
- God!

12:51.971 --> 12:56.240
It's hot! It's hot!
I'm sweating. God!

12:56.308 --> 12:58.610
Why is that window closed?

12:58.677 --> 13:02.246
Well, it's a little thing
we call winter, honey.

13:02.314 --> 13:05.616
Honey, maybe this is
one of those hot flashes.

13:05.684 --> 13:07.318
I am not having a hot flash.

13:07.386 --> 13:11.589
- No.
- It is too soon for hot flashes!

13:11.657 --> 13:13.696
Well, didn't your doctor say if
you took some of that estrogen,

13:13.726 --> 13:16.861
it would help these hot
flashes and mood swings?

13:16.928 --> 13:19.297
So now you think
I'm having a mood swing?

13:19.365 --> 13:22.099
I think whatever
you're thinking.

13:22.167 --> 13:24.936
Tim, don't patronize me, okay?

13:25.004 --> 13:26.976
I am not gonna take estrogen
until I've had a chance

13:27.006 --> 13:28.506
- to research it.
- All right.

13:28.574 --> 13:30.179
I can't research it until
I've finished my thesis!

13:30.209 --> 13:32.643
And I can't finish my
thesis 'cause I'm so hot!

13:32.711 --> 13:34.812
Why can't you understand that?

13:34.880 --> 13:36.613
I don't know!

13:41.720 --> 13:44.989
If you want to go back up to her
bedroom, better put on your mukluks.

13:46.992 --> 13:48.793
Is Jill having a hot flash?

13:48.860 --> 13:50.295
I guess that's what it is.

13:50.362 --> 13:52.897
She wants me to go to the
store, get some low-fat milk.

13:54.433 --> 13:57.902
Well, just hang in there.
Things will get better.

13:57.969 --> 13:59.337
I hope so.

13:59.405 --> 14:02.139
I wonder if I'm gonna make
it through menopause.

14:02.207 --> 14:05.142
You're doing a great job, Tim.

14:05.210 --> 14:07.144
A lot better than my husband.

14:07.212 --> 14:09.914
I bet the Colonel had
a problem with this.

14:09.982 --> 14:11.849
When I went through the change,

14:11.917 --> 14:15.286
he slipped a card under my door that
read, "Get well. On the double."

14:16.288 --> 14:18.021
Gutsy move.

14:18.089 --> 14:20.725
Well, the Colonel was even worse
when my mother went through it.

14:20.859 --> 14:22.894
She was living
with us at the time.

14:22.961 --> 14:25.562
He walked in one day,
saw her having a hot flash,

14:25.630 --> 14:31.068
did an about-face and volunteered
to fight in the Korean War.

14:31.136 --> 14:34.071
I didn't see him
again until 1957.

14:35.874 --> 14:37.709
Well, didn't the
Korean War end in '53?

14:37.776 --> 14:39.010
Yes!

14:44.650 --> 14:46.416
Oh, hi, honey.

14:46.484 --> 14:48.085
Hi. Hi.

14:48.153 --> 14:49.219
Where's Tim?

14:49.287 --> 14:52.256
He went out to get
you some low-fat milk.

14:52.323 --> 14:54.692
Low-fat milk...
Oh, great.

14:54.760 --> 14:57.895
Well, that's what he
thought you wanted.

14:57.963 --> 15:01.265
No, Mom. I gotta get this
calcium-fortified stuff.

15:01.333 --> 15:04.602
It's supposed to be good
to prevent osteoporosis.

15:04.669 --> 15:07.671
I just wish that he had asked
me before he went out.

15:07.739 --> 15:09.378
Well, now, Jill, honey,
listen to yourself.

15:09.408 --> 15:13.644
Ever since the surgery, you've
been blaming Tim for everything.

15:13.712 --> 15:14.612
That is not true, Mom.

15:14.680 --> 15:16.481
Well, yes, it is.

15:16.548 --> 15:18.520
Now, he tried to make things
easier for you at school

15:18.550 --> 15:21.719
and you yelled at him. And he
waits on you hand and foot,

15:21.787 --> 15:23.420
and you yell at him
for that, too.

15:23.489 --> 15:26.423
Mom, look, I just came
down here to get a cold drink.

15:26.491 --> 15:28.426
I don't need a lecture.

15:28.493 --> 15:30.361
Well, this is not a lecture.

15:30.429 --> 15:33.898
This is advice that you shouldn't
interrupt until I'm finished.

15:36.768 --> 15:39.603
Well, you're gonna have
to finish it without me

15:39.671 --> 15:41.638
because I have to
work on my thesis.

15:41.707 --> 15:43.307
Oh, that'll solve everything.

15:43.374 --> 15:46.610
Then what are you gonna hide
behind when you're done with that?

15:50.248 --> 15:53.283
Jill, honey,

15:53.351 --> 15:56.120
I know you weren't expecting to
have a hysterectomy at your age.

15:56.188 --> 15:58.389
And I know it must be very hard.

15:58.456 --> 16:00.724
But you've got to stop
taking your anger out

16:00.793 --> 16:03.294
on other people
and deal with your loss.

16:03.361 --> 16:06.697
I am dealing with my loss, Mom.

16:06.765 --> 16:09.900
This is the way
I am dealing with my loss!

16:09.968 --> 16:13.737
I'm sorry! I am very angry!

16:13.805 --> 16:15.640
I hate this!
I hate this! I hate this,

16:15.707 --> 16:19.076
this empty way I feel!

16:19.144 --> 16:21.779
I hate the way
I look to myself now.

16:21.846 --> 16:24.649
I hate that doctor for doing this to me!
I hate my body!

16:24.716 --> 16:29.320
I hate myself! I hate everybody
and everything! Oh, God!

16:30.455 --> 16:33.023
Oh, honey, honey.

16:33.091 --> 16:38.062
I just feel so old and useless.

16:41.700 --> 16:46.237
I felt exactly the same way
when I went through menopause.

16:46.305 --> 16:48.573
- You did?
- Yes.

16:48.640 --> 16:52.176
I remember being around
all those young women

16:52.244 --> 16:54.445
and seeing how all
the men looked at them.

16:54.513 --> 16:57.481
And I felt like I couldn't turn
a head if my hair was on fire.

16:57.549 --> 16:58.782
Well...

17:02.154 --> 17:06.557
I thought because my body had
changed, I was less of a woman.

17:08.358 --> 17:11.060
And what did you do?

17:11.128 --> 17:15.066
Well, one day I sat down
and looked in the mirror,

17:15.133 --> 17:18.169
and I took stock of myself.

17:18.236 --> 17:23.674
And I realized I had my
looks, my health, my brains,

17:23.741 --> 17:26.810
four beautiful daughters.

17:26.877 --> 17:29.313
And the best part is no PMS.

17:31.450 --> 17:32.749
Or periods.

17:32.918 --> 17:34.451
Or cramps.

17:35.086 --> 17:37.555
That's true.

17:37.622 --> 17:40.991
I never knew that it
was so rough on you.

17:41.059 --> 17:43.928
Well, every woman
has a rough time.

17:43.996 --> 17:48.199
And, you know, in my day, we
didn't talk about it so easily.

17:48.267 --> 17:50.868
The only thing we
shared were recipes.

17:50.936 --> 17:53.470
Well, I can't do that.
Nobody wants mine.

17:55.007 --> 17:56.740
That's not true.

17:58.043 --> 17:59.377
Mom,

18:00.512 --> 18:02.313
after

18:02.381 --> 18:04.148
you went through menopause,

18:05.417 --> 18:07.518
did Dad still find you...

18:07.985 --> 18:09.353
Desirable?

18:09.420 --> 18:10.988
Yeah.
You betcha.

18:11.055 --> 18:12.756
Really? Well...

18:12.824 --> 18:14.525
Uh...

18:14.593 --> 18:16.660
What about you? Did you
still have the same...

18:16.728 --> 18:17.928
- Same drive?
- Yeah.

18:17.996 --> 18:19.897
Actually, even more so.

18:19.964 --> 18:23.301
I remember one night he came home
from three months on maneuvers,

18:23.368 --> 18:25.603
and we went up to the bedroom.
And I was just a wild...

18:25.671 --> 18:28.472
That's okay, Mom! Thank you.
That's good! That's good.

18:30.175 --> 18:32.376
He saluted me for a week.

18:52.029 --> 18:53.297
Tim, is that you?

18:53.898 --> 18:55.232
I'll go with no.

18:58.169 --> 19:01.072
What took you so long?
I wanted to talk to you.

19:01.139 --> 19:03.174
I was at the store getting
you some low-fat milk.

19:03.242 --> 19:06.944
  And in anticipation of your ever-changing
moods, I got you a variety.

19:07.012 --> 19:09.413
I got 2%. I got you 1%.

19:09.481 --> 19:10.948
I got you low-fat skims.

19:11.016 --> 19:12.816
I got you lactose-free.

19:12.885 --> 19:16.287
I got soy milk, rice milk,

19:16.355 --> 19:19.656
goat milk, and for me,
milk of magnesia.

19:25.363 --> 19:28.666
I can't believe you got seven
different kinds of milk.

19:28.734 --> 19:30.167
Well, that's all they had.

19:32.103 --> 19:34.805
No. It was really sweet.

19:34.873 --> 19:37.241
Tim, come over here.
I want to talk to you.

19:41.379 --> 19:43.080
I want to apologize.

19:43.581 --> 19:44.581
Uh?

19:47.686 --> 19:50.988
I've been really upset. And I've
misdirected my anger at you.

19:51.056 --> 19:52.661
And it's really not fair,
'cause you've been so

19:52.691 --> 19:54.091
attentive,
and caring and sweet...

19:54.158 --> 19:56.060
Honey, honey, honey.
and patient.

19:56.127 --> 19:58.447
It's okay. You did the same for
me when I got my vasectomy.

19:59.164 --> 20:01.365
But you were the one
who made me get it.

20:04.135 --> 20:05.635
I made you get it?

20:05.703 --> 20:08.505
I strongly urged you to get it.

20:08.573 --> 20:11.608
And once you knew that it wasn't
gonna make you any less of a man

20:11.676 --> 20:14.211
or that I wasn't gonna look
at you any differently,

20:14.980 --> 20:16.680
you were okay with it.

20:17.582 --> 20:18.849
Yeah, I was.

20:20.952 --> 20:23.553
What about me?

20:23.621 --> 20:26.757
Of course you're okay with it.
You're the one that made me do it.

20:29.794 --> 20:33.130
No. I mean, what about, you
know, me with my situation now?

20:33.198 --> 20:36.767
I mean, are you gonna want to
spend the rest of your days

20:36.834 --> 20:39.069
with a hollowed-out
old pumpkin?

20:40.505 --> 20:41.705
Sure!

20:45.877 --> 20:48.979
Are you gonna still
find me desirable?

20:49.047 --> 20:53.316
I didn't marry you because of
your uterus or your ovaries.

20:53.384 --> 20:55.318
I married you
because of what's inside.

21:06.565 --> 21:09.900
You know what? I'm gonna take that
extension that you got for me.

21:09.968 --> 21:11.101
Good.

21:12.037 --> 21:13.370
I love you.

21:13.438 --> 21:15.072
I love you, too.

21:17.442 --> 21:19.113
When do you suppose
you and I will be able to...

21:19.143 --> 21:22.713
No, honey. I think it's gonna be
a while before we can have sex.

21:22.781 --> 21:25.549
No. I mean, turn the
thermostat up a little bit.

21:32.858 --> 21:34.925
It's interesting here, honey.

21:34.992 --> 21:38.562
It turns out that humans aren't the
only mammals to go through menopause.

21:38.630 --> 21:40.331
You're in great company.

21:40.398 --> 21:42.065
Who else?

21:42.133 --> 21:44.134
Whales and elephants.

21:47.038 --> 21:51.408
You're now comparing me to
large, gray, blubbery animals?

21:51.476 --> 21:53.710
In a good way.

21:53.778 --> 21:56.379
I mean, they're friendly,
fun to ride.

21:56.447 --> 21:58.449
They make...

22:00.552 --> 22:03.654
And in the right light
I find them very sexy.

22:03.722 --> 22:05.790
I'll be in my room.
