WEBVTT

00:02.573 --> 00:04.275
(Meredith)
TO A CRITICALLY ILL PATIENT,

00:04.275 --> 00:06.507
AN ORGAN TRANSPLANT MEANS
A NEW START,

00:06.507 --> 00:08.339
A SECOND CHANCE.

00:08.339 --> 00:10.281
BUT THE BODY IS DESIGNED
TO FIGHT OFF

00:10.281 --> 00:12.083
ANY OUTSIDE INVADER,

00:12.083 --> 00:14.085
EVEN ONE THAT'S TRYING
TO SAVE IT.

00:14.085 --> 00:16.087
JACKSON AVERY REALLY HAS
A BIGGER SAY

00:16.087 --> 00:17.718
THAN ANY OF US
IN RUNNING THIS HOSPITAL?

00:17.718 --> 00:19.420
THAT CAN'T BE TRUE.
CAN IT?

00:19.420 --> 00:21.422
WELL, HE'S A VOTING MEMBER
OF THE MANAGEMENT TEAM

00:21.422 --> 00:24.595
AND HE ALSO REPRESENTS
THE HARPER AVERY FOUNDATION.

00:24.595 --> 00:26.427
AND THEIR 175 MILLION BUCKS.

00:26.427 --> 00:28.359
AS OPPOSED TO
OUR $15 MILLION APIECE.

00:28.359 --> 00:29.630
(Callie chuckles)
(Derek) ACCORDING TO STAN,

00:29.630 --> 00:31.162
NOT ONLY DOES HE HAVE
THE DECIDING VOTE,

00:31.162 --> 00:32.333
HE CAN VETO OURS.

00:32.333 --> 00:33.764
BECAUSE A TRANSPLANT
DOESN'T GUARANTEE

00:33.764 --> 00:35.436
THAT IT'S AN EASIER LIFE.

00:35.436 --> 00:38.339
THAT IS RIDICULOUS.
HE'S A FELLOW.

00:38.339 --> 00:39.610
SO ARE YOU.

00:39.610 --> 00:41.612
BUT HE'S A PLASTICS FELLOW.
AND I'M ME.

00:41.612 --> 00:44.115
(Meredith)
WELL, LET'S NOT OVERREACT.

00:44.115 --> 00:45.316
I MEAN, IT'S JACKSON. HE'S NOT
SOME CORPORATE STRANGER.

00:45.316 --> 00:46.647
HE'S ONE OF US.

00:46.647 --> 00:48.279
(Derek) NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.
HE'S A SMART KID.

00:48.279 --> 00:49.480
HE'S GONNA FOLLOW OUR LEAD.

00:49.480 --> 00:51.482
NO. NO.
WE MADE THIS PLAN.

00:51.482 --> 00:52.653
WE PULLED IT TOGETHER.

00:52.653 --> 00:54.185
LOOK, I'M GRATEFUL
TO HARPER AVERY

00:54.185 --> 00:55.326
FOR AN INFUSION OF CASH,

00:55.326 --> 00:57.428
BUT I'M--I'M NOT GONNA LET
SOME--SOME...

00:57.428 --> 00:58.629
PLASTICS FELLOW?

00:58.629 --> 01:00.161
PLASTICS FELLOW
TELL ME HOW TO RUN MY SERVICE

01:00.161 --> 01:01.532
'CAUSE HIS MOMMY
SAID HE COULD.

01:01.532 --> 01:02.693
PREACH.

01:02.693 --> 01:04.064
THERE'S A THREAT
THAT THE BODY

01:04.064 --> 01:05.696
WILL REJECT
THE ORGAN OUTRIGHT.

01:05.696 --> 01:07.067
IT WAS YOUR IDEA.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.239
IT WAS PILLOW TALK.

01:08.239 --> 01:09.400
AND SUDDENLY,
IT'S A BUSINESS PLAN.

01:09.400 --> 01:10.471
YOU WERE ALL FOR IT
AT THE TIME.

01:10.471 --> 01:12.243
YOU INVESTING
IN THE HOSPITAL, SURE.

01:12.243 --> 01:14.205
ANOINTING YOUR SON
BOY KING?

01:14.205 --> 01:15.506
WHAT ON EARTH MAKES YOU THINK
THAT YOUNG MAN'S PREPARED

01:15.506 --> 01:17.308
TO TAKE ON THIS KIND
OF RESPONSIBILITY?

01:17.308 --> 01:18.779
HE'S MY SON.
I KNOW WHAT HE'S CAPABLE OF.

01:18.779 --> 01:20.451
AND HE'S MY STUDENT.
I DO, TOO.

01:20.451 --> 01:23.083
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY,
I SHOULD REVISE THAT.

01:23.083 --> 01:24.255
NOW HE'S MY BOSS,

01:24.255 --> 01:26.086
AND MY GIRLFRIEND
IS MY BOSS' BOSS.

01:26.086 --> 01:27.388
WHAT COULD POSSIBLY
GO WRONG?

01:27.388 --> 01:29.620
YOU ARE FORGETTING
WHO YOU'RE DATING, RICHARD.

01:29.620 --> 01:32.463
I'M THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD
OF A LARGE FOUNDATION.

01:32.463 --> 01:35.696
I HAVE MADE
AN EXTREMELY SAVVY INVESTMENT.

01:35.696 --> 01:38.399
AND I WILL MANAGE MY INVESTMENT
AS I SEE PRUDENT.

01:38.399 --> 01:40.301
I'VE PLACED AT THE TOP
OF THE ORGANIZATION

01:40.301 --> 01:42.473
AN INDIVIDUAL
THAT IS ENERGETIC,

01:42.473 --> 01:44.735
MOTIVATED, AND RESPONSIVE.

01:44.735 --> 01:46.437
(elevator bell dings)

01:46.437 --> 01:50.841
THERE'S ONLY ONE ROOM IN WHICH
I TAKE ORDERS FROM MY BOYFRIEND.

01:50.841 --> 01:53.384
THIS IS NOT IT.

01:53.384 --> 01:54.845
(Catherine) GOOD MORNING,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

01:54.845 --> 01:56.347
(men and women)
GOOD MORNING.

01:56.347 --> 01:59.150
SHALL WE?

01:59.150 --> 02:02.323
OKAY, SO WE'RE AGREED THAT
THE PEDS AND ADULT E.R.s

02:02.323 --> 02:04.225
WILL BE COMBINED
TO SAVE ON PERSONNEL?
(Cristina) YEAH.

02:04.225 --> 02:05.456
MM-HMM.
(Derek) YEAH.

02:05.456 --> 02:06.427
I'M SORRY, GUYS.

02:06.427 --> 02:08.128
I WAS RUNNING ON TIME,

02:08.128 --> 02:12.763
AND THEN MY LAST ROUNDS' PATIENT
TURNED INTO A CRIER.

02:12.763 --> 02:14.435
POW.

02:14.435 --> 02:18.439
(siren wailing)

02:19.740 --> 02:22.813
UH, WE WERE DISCUSSING
THE REOPENING OF THE E.R.

02:22.813 --> 02:24.345
AND THE TRAUMA DEPARTMENT.

02:24.345 --> 02:25.646
OH, YES.

02:25.646 --> 02:28.549
UM, I'M NOT READY
FOR THAT JUST YET.

02:28.549 --> 02:29.720
IF YOU NEED MORE TIME
WITH THE MATERIAL,

02:29.720 --> 02:30.881
WE CAN GO AHEAD--

02:30.881 --> 02:32.253
NO, NO,
I'VE--I'VE READ IT.

02:32.253 --> 02:33.384
UH, IT'S JUST THAT

02:33.384 --> 02:34.725
THE FOUNDATION FEELS LIKE

02:34.725 --> 02:36.457
THE E.R. IS NOT
A FORGONE CONCLUSION.

02:36.457 --> 02:38.158
THEY NEED A SITE VISIT,

02:38.158 --> 02:39.430
A CHANCE TO LOOK OVER
THE NUMBERS.

02:39.430 --> 02:40.791
IT COULD BE A MONTH
BEFORE A DECISION.

02:40.791 --> 02:42.663
OKAY. (chuckles) THE FOUNDATION
KNOWS WE PLAN ON GETTING

02:42.663 --> 02:45.236
OUR LEVEL-I TRAUMA DESIGNATION
BACK, RIGHT?

02:45.236 --> 02:46.597
THEY KNOW THAT'S THE IDEA,
YEAH.

02:46.597 --> 02:48.168
UH, IT'S THE FACT.

02:48.168 --> 02:49.800
I THINK WE SHOULD TABLE THIS
UNTIL WE CAN BRING IN OWEN.

02:49.800 --> 02:51.742
UH, HE'LL HAVE A LOT
OF THOUGHTS ON THIS, TOO.

02:51.742 --> 02:53.944
(Arizona) YEAH--
THAT'S--THAT'S THE OTHER THING.

02:53.944 --> 02:55.506
WHAT THING?

02:59.179 --> 03:01.382
OKAY.

03:02.553 --> 03:05.486
SINCE WE ARE STARTING FRESH,
THE THOUGHT IS THAT

03:05.486 --> 03:08.919
NEW LEADERSHIP WOULD BE
GOOD FOR MORALE.

03:11.292 --> 03:13.464
WHAT, LIKE, UH,
CHIEF OF SURGERY?

03:13.464 --> 03:15.396
OH, NO WAY.
FIRING OWEN?

03:15.396 --> 03:16.967
(Cristina) OKAY,
WE'RE NOT FIRING OWEN.

03:16.967 --> 03:18.299
OKAY, WELL,
THE FOUNDATION THINKS THAT--
(Callie) YOUR MOTHER.

03:18.299 --> 03:19.630
THE HARPER AVERY FOUNDATION--

03:19.630 --> 03:21.372
YOUR MOTHER, AVERY.
JUST SAY IT.

03:21.372 --> 03:22.373
IT'S A RECOMMENDATION.

03:22.373 --> 03:23.634
IT'S AN INAPPROPRIATE ONE.

03:23.634 --> 03:25.336
OH, TELL YOUR MOM THAT.
THIS IS BULL--

03:25.336 --> 03:26.977
AND THIS IS GOING NOWHERE.
I HAVE SURGERY.

03:26.977 --> 03:29.480
YEAH. ME, TOO.
WE SHOULD GET BACK TO THIS.

03:31.842 --> 03:33.213
YOU KNOW, I DON'T CARE

03:33.213 --> 03:34.385
WHO'S GIVING YOU
YOUR MARCHING ORDERS,

03:34.385 --> 03:36.987
THIS THING WITH OWEN
IS NOT HAPPENING.

03:36.987 --> 03:38.319
WELL, SAY WHAT YOU WANT,

03:38.319 --> 03:39.820
BUT WITHOUT
THE HARPER AVERY FOUNDATION,

03:39.820 --> 03:41.822
NONE OF US ARE HERE.

03:41.822 --> 03:43.354
AND WE APPRECIATE THAT.

03:43.354 --> 03:44.895
BUT NO ONE EXPECTED THEM
TO COME IN

03:44.895 --> 03:46.797
AND START DICTATING POLICY.

03:46.797 --> 03:48.329
YEAH, WELL, NO ONE ASKED YOU

03:48.329 --> 03:49.830
TO SUE THE HOSPITAL
INTO BANKRUPTCY EITHER.

03:49.830 --> 03:53.604
FOR THE PLANE CRASH
THAT KILLED LEXIE?

04:07.448 --> 04:09.550
IF WE PUT KEPNER'S DONOR
TO O.R. 1,

04:09.550 --> 04:11.982
THAT MOVES BAILEY'S HERNIA
TO O.R. 5.

04:11.982 --> 04:14.425
ROBBINS IS IN 5.
OKAY, 6.

04:14.425 --> 04:15.856
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH NURSES
TO STAFF 6.

04:15.856 --> 04:17.788
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU WERE GETTING THEM BACK.

04:17.788 --> 04:19.460
I'M TRYING. SOME OF THEM
ARE BITCHIER THAN I AM.

04:19.460 --> 04:20.631
(chuckles)
(Alex) CHIEF.

04:20.631 --> 04:21.992
YEAH.
U.N.O.S. JUST CALLED.

04:21.992 --> 04:23.894
THEY GOT A KIDNEY THAT'S
A MATCH FOR JAELYNN DONOVAN.

04:23.894 --> 04:25.265
YEAH, WE HAVE NO ROOM TODAY,
KAREV.

04:25.265 --> 04:26.737
NO O.R. STAFF.
HALF THE NURSES HAVE QUIT,

04:26.737 --> 04:28.799
INCLUDING
THE TRANSPLANT COORDINATOR.

04:28.799 --> 04:30.371
YOU MAY NEED TO DECLINE
THIS ONE.

04:30.371 --> 04:31.372
THIS GIRL'S 16.

04:31.372 --> 04:32.703
SHE'S BEEN ON DIALYSIS
FOR 3 YEARS.

04:32.703 --> 04:34.004
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

04:34.004 --> 04:36.707
WELL, WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT,
OKAY?

04:36.707 --> 04:39.279
(sighs) OKAY, SO--

04:39.279 --> 04:40.451
OWEN.

04:40.451 --> 04:41.582
UH, JUST A SECOND.

04:41.582 --> 04:43.484
OWEN, THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT
REPLACING YOU.

04:43.484 --> 04:44.685
RUTH, EXCUSE US, PLEASE.

04:44.685 --> 04:47.017
WHAT? W-WHY? WHO IS?

04:47.017 --> 04:48.419
AVERY.

04:48.419 --> 04:49.560
BUT WE'RE NOT
GONNA LET THAT HAPPEN.

04:49.560 --> 04:50.891
I JUST DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO HEAR A RUMOR

04:50.891 --> 04:52.062
AND THINK I DIDN'T TELL--

04:52.062 --> 04:53.394
DR. YANG,
IT'S U.N.O.S.

04:53.394 --> 04:54.625
THEY HAVE A HEART
AND LUNGS.

04:54.625 --> 04:56.497
I'M GONNA TALK
TO CATHERINE AVERY.

04:56.497 --> 04:58.429
YOU'RE NOT GONNA DO ANYTHING.
I AM. TAKE YOUR CALL.

04:58.429 --> 05:00.801
UH...

05:00.801 --> 05:02.373
DR. YANG HERE.

05:02.373 --> 05:03.334
(bell dings)

05:03.334 --> 05:04.675
BRADLEY PARKER,
31 YEARS OLD,

05:04.675 --> 05:05.936
END-STAGE A.L.S.

05:05.936 --> 05:07.307
UH, TRACH-DEPENDENT.

05:07.307 --> 05:08.609
HAD A LAP-CHOLE
THREE WEEKS AGO.

05:08.609 --> 05:10.441
NOW PRESENTS WITH
A CHIEF COMPLAINT

05:10.441 --> 05:11.742
OF HEMATOCHEZIA.

05:11.742 --> 05:13.584
HE ACTUALLY USED THE WORD
"HEMATOCHEZIA."

05:13.584 --> 05:15.386
YEAH, HE WAS AN INTERNAL
MEDICINE RESIDENT

05:15.386 --> 05:17.317
AT MERCY WEST
WHILE I WAS THERE.

05:17.317 --> 05:18.789
HE DID A RESIDENCY
WITH A.L.S.?

05:18.789 --> 05:20.320
HE WAS DIAGNOSED SECOND YEAR

05:20.320 --> 05:21.752
AND WORKED TILL
HE COULDN'T ANYMORE.

05:21.752 --> 05:23.494
HE'S AN AMAZING GUY.
(rap music
playing indistinctly)

05:23.494 --> 05:25.496
IS THAT COMING FROM...

05:25.496 --> 05:26.927
(indistinct conversations)

05:26.927 --> 05:28.759
(man) ♪ TRY TO KEEP US
IN THE MINORS ♪

05:28.759 --> 05:30.100

05:30.100 --> 05:31.402

05:31.402 --> 05:32.933

05:32.933 --> 05:34.935
HEY, COULD YOU TURN THAT DOWN?
♪ YEAH, DOUBLE UP HIS SALARY ♪

05:34.935 --> 05:36.467
(turns music off)
HEY, GUYS. WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON HERE?

05:36.467 --> 05:39.039
THIS IS A HOSPITAL. THERE ARE
VERY SICK PEOPLE HERE.

05:39.039 --> 05:41.472
THAT INCLUDES YOU, TOO, BRAD.

05:41.472 --> 05:43.013
OKAY, EVERYONE OUT.

05:43.013 --> 05:44.344
LET'S GO. OUT. COME ON.
(people speaking indistinctly)

05:44.344 --> 05:45.676
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

05:45.676 --> 05:47.478
I INVITED THEM.

05:47.478 --> 05:48.849
UH-HUH.

05:48.849 --> 05:51.422
WELL, DR. EDWARDS AND I NEED TO
DISCUSS YOUR NEXT STEPS.

05:51.422 --> 05:54.685
SO MAYBE IF EVERYONE
COULD LEAVE--

05:54.685 --> 05:57.488
I ALREADY KNOW MY NEXT STEP.

05:57.488 --> 05:59.860
I'M DONATING MY ORGANS.

05:59.860 --> 06:03.464
WE DO ORGAN DONATION
AFTER A PATIENT'S BRAIN DEAD.

06:03.464 --> 06:05.396
YOU'RE NOWHERE CLOSE
TO BRAIN DEAD.

06:05.396 --> 06:08.138
I'M DOING... (coughs)

06:08.138 --> 06:09.570
MOM. (coughing)

06:09.570 --> 06:11.502
HE'S DOING D.C.D.

06:11.502 --> 06:13.544
UH, DONATION
AFTER CARDIAC DEATH.

06:13.544 --> 06:16.847
HE CAN GIVE
IF HIS HEART STOPS.

06:16.847 --> 06:20.110
(labored breathing)

06:20.110 --> 06:22.753
I'M BEING KEPT ALIVE

06:22.753 --> 06:24.555
BY THIS VENT.

06:24.555 --> 06:27.387
ONCE WE DISCONNECT IT...

06:27.387 --> 06:28.989
BOOYAH.

06:30.521 --> 06:33.123
(coughs)
CHIEF HUNT SIGNED OFF.

06:33.123 --> 06:36.126
WELCOME TO MY FUNERAL.

06:37.498 --> 06:38.469
(huffs)

06:39.900 --> 06:41.632
AVERY...

06:41.632 --> 06:42.973
AM I IN OR OUT?

06:42.973 --> 06:44.505
WHAT? THAT'S--

06:44.505 --> 06:45.806
WORD IS
I MIGHT BE OUT OF A JOB,

06:45.806 --> 06:47.608
SO I'D LIKE TO HEAR IT
FROM YOU.

06:47.608 --> 06:49.540
(sighs)

06:49.540 --> 06:51.411
YEAH,
THERE WAS A THOUGHT THAT

06:51.411 --> 06:54.715
A CHANGE IN LEADERSHIP
COULD BE GOOD FOR STAFF MORALE.

06:54.715 --> 06:55.886
OH, FOR MORALE?

06:55.886 --> 06:57.548
I'VE BEEN KILLING MYSELF
TO KEEP MORALE UP

06:57.548 --> 06:58.889
FOR THE PAST THREE WEEKS,

06:58.889 --> 07:00.451
TO KEEP THIS PLACE OPEN.

07:00.451 --> 07:01.652
AND NO ONE IS SAYING
THAT YOU HAVEN'T--

07:01.652 --> 07:02.823
NOBODY'S SAYING ANYTHING.

07:02.823 --> 07:03.994
I'VE BEEN SHUT OUT
OF EVERY DECISION

07:03.994 --> 07:05.155
THAT YOU PEOPLE MAKE.

07:05.155 --> 07:06.156
AND NOW I HEAR THIS?

07:06.156 --> 07:07.528
ALL RIGHT. CALM DOWN.

07:07.528 --> 07:08.859
DON'T TELL ME
TO CALM DOWN!

07:08.859 --> 07:10.200
GUYS, GUYS, GUYS.
LET'S TAKE THIS SOMEWHERE ELSE.

07:10.200 --> 07:11.562
OH, THIS IS COMING
FROM YOU, TOO?

07:11.562 --> 07:13.133
YOU'RE ALL JUST TALKING ABOUT
A NEW CHIEF?

07:13.133 --> 07:15.506
NO. NO.

07:15.506 --> 07:16.837
IT WAS BROUGHT UP,
AND WE TABLED IT.

07:16.837 --> 07:18.008
OH, YOU TABLED IT?

07:18.008 --> 07:19.540
YOU SHOULDN'T EVEN BE TALKING
ABOUT IT.

07:19.540 --> 07:20.671
LISTEN, THIS IS A DECISION
THAT WE HAVE--

07:20.671 --> 07:22.442
AVERY, ENOUGH.
I'M JUST TRYING TO EXPLAIN--

07:22.442 --> 07:23.974
AVERY, GO!

07:23.974 --> 07:27.978
(indistinct conversations)

07:27.978 --> 07:29.520
(exhales)

07:29.520 --> 07:32.022
YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO
THERE ARE POLITICS HERE.

07:32.022 --> 07:34.755
MM-HMM.
WE'RE TRYING TO FIND OUR WAY.
JUST SIT TIGHT.

07:34.755 --> 07:35.926
I AM THROUGH SITTING TIGHT.

07:35.926 --> 07:37.087
I AM THROUGH LOOKING LIKE
AN IDIOT

07:37.087 --> 07:38.228
WHILE YOU ALL LIE TO ME.

07:38.228 --> 07:39.690
NO, WE'RE NOT LYING TO YOU.

07:39.690 --> 07:41.461
OH, WHEN YOU SAID
THAT WE WERE IN THIS TOGETHER,

07:41.461 --> 07:43.964
I THANKED YOU, AND THEN
ONE HOUR LATER, YOU QUIT.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.536
YOU'RE A LIAR.

07:45.536 --> 07:46.497
NO, NO, NO, NO.
YOU LIED TO THE STAFF.

07:46.497 --> 07:47.838
WE ARE DOING
THE BEST WE CAN.

07:47.838 --> 07:48.999
AND THEN I'M THIS POOR SUCKER
RUNNING AROUND

07:48.999 --> 07:50.501
TRYING TO FIX THIS MESS
THAT YOU ALL MADE!

07:50.501 --> 07:51.842
YOU DON'T!

07:51.842 --> 07:53.844
YOU DO NOT WANT TO GET
INTO WHOSE RESPONSIBILITY

07:53.844 --> 07:55.205
THIS IS.

07:55.205 --> 07:56.777
YOU DON'T WANT TO GET
INTO WHO'S RESPONSIBLE

07:56.777 --> 07:58.478
FOR ALL OF THIS.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.581
YOU DON'T!

08:00.581 --> 08:01.712
(sighs)

08:01.712 --> 08:05.015
(indistinct conversations
continue)

08:05.015 --> 08:08.258
WELL, I CAN MAKE THIS DECISION
EASIER FOR YOU.

08:08.258 --> 08:09.590
I QUIT.

08:09.590 --> 08:11.522
WHOA.

08:11.522 --> 08:13.724
(indistinct conversations
continue)

08:13.724 --> 08:24.805
(siren wailing)

08:26.236 --> 08:27.878
(man) RIGHT THERE.

08:27.878 --> 08:30.981
OWEN, WHAT HAPPENED?

08:30.981 --> 08:32.142
(man shouts indistinctly)

08:32.142 --> 08:33.914
DID YOU GET THE HEART
AND THE LUNGS?

08:33.914 --> 08:35.085
I--YES.

08:35.085 --> 08:36.246
THAT'S GREAT.

08:36.246 --> 08:37.618
TALK TO ME.

08:37.618 --> 08:40.721
(exhales) NOTHING HAPPENED,
I'M JUST...

08:40.721 --> 08:41.892
I'M DONE.

08:41.892 --> 08:43.554
I SHOULD'VE BEEN DONE
A LONG TIME AGO.

08:43.554 --> 08:44.955
OKAY, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

08:44.955 --> 08:48.228
SHEPHERD IS RIGHT.
THIS IS ALL ON ME.

08:48.228 --> 08:49.600
(man shouts indistinctly)

08:49.600 --> 08:50.561
NO ONE BLAMES YOU.

08:50.561 --> 08:51.732
WELL, SOMEBODY DOES.

08:51.732 --> 08:53.734
AND AS LONG AS THAT'S TRUE,
I...

08:53.734 --> 08:56.837
I DON'T SEE
HOW I CAN BE EFFECTIVE HERE.

08:56.837 --> 08:58.669
(woman speaks indistinctly)

08:58.669 --> 09:01.111
(siren wailing)

09:01.111 --> 09:03.213
DEPENDING ON WHEN THE ORGANS
COME IN,

09:03.213 --> 09:05.315
YOU MIGHT NEED TO ADJUST
THE O.R. BOARD,

09:05.315 --> 09:06.977
MOVE THINGS OFF UNTIL TOMORROW.

09:06.977 --> 09:08.148
(engine turns over)

09:08.148 --> 09:09.319
(tires squeal)

09:09.319 --> 09:10.981
SWEETHEART. OWEN...

09:12.583 --> 09:13.724
(bell dings)

09:13.724 --> 09:15.225
NOT THE SAME.

09:15.225 --> 09:16.657
SURGEONS SAVE LIVES.

09:16.657 --> 09:18.128
YOU JUST CATCH IT WHEN IT
FALLS OUT OF SOMEONE.

09:18.128 --> 09:19.690
O.B.s DO SURGERY.

09:19.690 --> 09:20.831
MM.
IF A BABY IS NOT COMING OUT...

09:20.831 --> 09:22.863
MM-HMM.
I GO IN, AND I GET IT.

09:22.863 --> 09:24.334
IT'S NOT THE SAME.

09:24.334 --> 09:26.637
OH, PLUS EVERY PATIENT THAT
I HAVE IS TWO PATIENTS IN ONE.

09:26.637 --> 09:27.998
SO BEAT THAT.

09:27.998 --> 09:30.170
YOU WEAR PINK SCRUBS.

09:30.170 --> 09:31.341
YEAH.

09:31.341 --> 09:32.703
(laughs)

09:32.703 --> 09:33.744
YEAH, YOU WIN.

09:33.744 --> 09:34.975
(laughing)
I HAVE NO RESPONSE FOR THAT.

09:34.975 --> 09:37.648
YOU REALLY PULL IT OFF,
THOUGH.

09:37.648 --> 09:39.009
OH, THANK YOU.

09:39.009 --> 09:40.951
MM-HMM. (giggles)

09:40.951 --> 09:42.112
(ding)

09:42.112 --> 09:43.684
(indistinct conversations)

09:43.684 --> 09:45.656
ALEX, DO YOU KNOW JASON?

09:45.656 --> 09:47.718
YEAH, CHEST PECKWELL.
JASON MYERS.

09:47.718 --> 09:48.989
HAVE YOU SEEN WHERE
JAELYNN DONOVAN'S PARENTS ARE?

09:48.989 --> 09:50.661
ISN'T JAELYNN
UP IN DIALYSIS?

09:50.661 --> 09:52.322
I KNOW WHERE SHE IS.
I ASKED ABOUT HER PARENTS.
EXCUSE ME.

09:52.322 --> 09:53.894
ARE YOU GETTING ON
OR WHAT?

09:53.894 --> 09:55.225
I'LL TAKE THE STAIRS.

09:55.225 --> 09:56.997
(ding)
(man) I'M GOING UP THERE, TOO.

09:56.997 --> 09:58.729
(woman) OH, ARE YOU?
MM-HMM.

09:58.729 --> 10:00.270
TURN TO PAGE SIX, EVERYONE,
THE--

10:00.270 --> 10:01.702
DR. AVERY, COULD YOU--

10:01.702 --> 10:03.233
OH, COME ON IN, SWEETHEART.

10:03.233 --> 10:05.736
WE'RE JUST GOING OVER
THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT

10:05.736 --> 10:07.207
YOU'LL BE SIGNING TONIGHT.

10:07.207 --> 10:09.209
I'M SURE YOU'VE READ
THROUGH THEM.

10:09.209 --> 10:11.982
CAN I SPEAK WITH YOU OUTSIDE
FOR JUST A MOMENT?

10:11.982 --> 10:13.143
OF COURSE. EXCUSE ME.

10:13.143 --> 10:14.314
(woman) OH, OF COURSE.

10:14.314 --> 10:15.816
(man) YEAH, IT'S RIGHT HERE.

10:15.816 --> 10:19.149
(woman speaks indistinctly
over p.a.)

10:19.149 --> 10:20.891
NO, I DID NOT
READ THROUGH THEM,

10:20.891 --> 10:22.653
AS I COULDN'T POSSIBLY
READ THROUGH THEM

10:22.653 --> 10:23.854
AS THEY ARE NOT IN ENGLISH.

10:23.854 --> 10:25.195
I UNDERSTAND.

10:25.195 --> 10:26.727
I AM NOT A LAWYER
AND I AM NOT AN ACCOUNTANT.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.158
STOP. BREATHE.

10:28.158 --> 10:30.630
NOBODY UNDERSTANDS
THOSE DOCUMENTS.

10:30.630 --> 10:33.964
THAT'S WHY THESE SMART PEOPLE
ARE HERE TO EXPLAIN THEM TO US.

10:33.964 --> 10:36.636
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS HEAR WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY.

10:36.636 --> 10:40.370
ASK A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS,
AND TRUST YOUR GUT.

10:40.370 --> 10:42.312
NOW PUT ON YOUR GAME FACE

10:42.312 --> 10:44.715
AND GO IN THERE
AND LISTEN TO THE SUITS.

10:44.715 --> 10:47.047
TRY NOT TO NOD OFF
WHEN THEY START TALKING ABOUT

10:47.047 --> 10:48.318
DEBT-TO-EQUITY RATIOS.

10:48.318 --> 10:49.419
IT'S LIKE A SEDATIVE.
GO ON.

10:49.419 --> 10:50.821
OKAY, ONE MORE THING.

10:50.821 --> 10:53.954
WHEN WE ARE IN THERE,
I AM NOT "SWEETHEART."

10:53.954 --> 10:56.056
(whispers) OKAY, BABY.

10:56.056 --> 10:57.287
OKAY...

10:57.287 --> 10:58.789
(men and women
speak indistinctly)

10:58.789 --> 11:01.792
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

11:01.792 --> 11:03.663
(indistinct conversations)

11:03.663 --> 11:05.896
WHAT THE...

11:05.896 --> 11:08.769
WHO IS THIS?

11:08.769 --> 11:10.100
GOD. IT'S THELONIOUS, DAD.

11:10.100 --> 11:12.102
WE'VE ONLY BEEN GETTING DIALYSIS
FOR, LIKE,

11:12.102 --> 11:13.904
AN ENTIRE YEAR TOGETHER.

11:13.904 --> 11:16.076
I'D BE MORE COMFORTABLE
IF YOU WERE IN YOUR OWN CHAIR.

11:16.076 --> 11:17.808
IT'S BAD ENOUGH
TO BE IN KIDNEY FAILURE.

11:17.808 --> 11:19.679
NOW YOU'RE GONNA SUCK
ALL THE FUN OUT OF IT?

11:19.679 --> 11:20.680
I'M JUST ASKING--

11:20.680 --> 11:22.282
HONEY, LET'S NOT FIGHT.
NOT NOW.

11:22.282 --> 11:24.755
IT'S TOO BIG A DAY.

11:24.755 --> 11:26.957
OH, NO.

11:26.957 --> 11:28.118
WHAT?

11:28.118 --> 11:29.790
WE FOUND A KIDNEY,
JAELYNN.

11:29.790 --> 11:30.861
NO MORE DIALYSIS.

11:30.861 --> 11:32.793
(exhales)

11:32.793 --> 11:33.964
(laughs)

11:33.964 --> 11:37.167
OH, MY GOD, THEO.
I'M GETTING A KIDNEY.

11:37.167 --> 11:38.729
SWEET.

11:38.729 --> 11:40.030
(machine whirring)

11:40.030 --> 11:41.371
YEAH.

11:41.371 --> 11:42.733
SWEET.

11:42.733 --> 11:45.035
DID ANYONE CALL JACKSON
FOR THIS?

11:45.035 --> 11:48.708
WHO CARES? I MEAN, THIS IS--
THIS IS HIS FAULT.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.710
WHY DO WE NEED
AN EMERGENCY MEETING?

11:50.710 --> 11:51.481
HUNT QUIT.

11:51.481 --> 11:53.083
WHAT?

11:53.083 --> 11:54.785
YOU CAN'T KEEP THROWING
THAT PLANE CRASH IN HIS FACE.

11:54.785 --> 11:55.916
OH, DON'T MAKE THIS
MY FAULT.

11:55.916 --> 11:57.387
HE WALKED OUT.
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TOLD HIM.

11:57.387 --> 11:58.889
WH--
WAIT. WAIT. YOU TOLD HIM?

11:58.889 --> 12:00.220
THAT HE MIGHT BE GETTING FIRED?
OF COURSE I DID.

12:00.220 --> 12:01.451
OH.
(Derek) NOTHING WAS DECIDED,
AND BESIDES,

12:01.451 --> 12:02.853
WE WEREN'T GONNA LET AVERY
GET RID OF HUNT.

12:02.853 --> 12:04.294
AVERY HAS HIS OWN AGENDA.

12:04.294 --> 12:05.996
NO, WARNING OWEN
IS THE LEAST WE CAN DO.

12:05.996 --> 12:07.497
WE WENT BEHIND HIS BACK
LONG ENOUGH.

12:07.497 --> 12:09.129
CRISTINA,
WE SHOULD PROBABLY KEEP

12:09.129 --> 12:10.500
WHAT'S SAID IN HERE PRIVATE.
(cell phone chimes)

12:10.500 --> 12:11.962
WELL, THEN COUNT ME OUT.

12:11.962 --> 12:13.934
I HAVE A HEART-LUNG TRANSPLANT
COMING IN.

12:13.934 --> 12:16.206
OH, WELL, KAREV'S KID JUST GOT
A KIDNEY FROM U.N.O.S.

12:16.206 --> 12:17.737
TWO TRANSPLANTS
IN ONE DAY?

12:17.737 --> 12:18.939
THREE WITH KEPNER'S
D.C.D.

12:18.939 --> 12:20.340
THREE?
THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN.

12:20.340 --> 12:21.772
(Arizona)
WELL, IT DID, OKAY?

12:21.772 --> 12:23.013
AND THE O.R.s
ARE FULLY BOOKED.

12:23.013 --> 12:24.214
WE HAVE
HALF THE NURSING STAFF

12:24.214 --> 12:25.275
AND NO TRANSPLANT COORDINATOR.

12:25.275 --> 12:26.446
WHO WAS HANDLING ALL THAT?

12:26.446 --> 12:28.348
(both) HUNT.
OHH.

12:28.348 --> 12:29.820
(telephone rings)

12:29.820 --> 12:30.981
OH. (exhales)

12:30.981 --> 12:32.152
(woman) NURSES' STATION.

12:32.152 --> 12:33.323
NO.

12:33.323 --> 12:34.484
(indistinct conversations)

12:34.484 --> 12:36.486
OH, AVERY.
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU ALL DOING

12:36.486 --> 12:38.488
ABOUT THE, UH,
PEGASUS PROTOCOLS?

12:38.488 --> 12:40.160
THE WHAT NOW?

12:40.160 --> 12:41.832
PEGASUS PUT ALL THESE
PROTOCOLS IN PLACE,

12:41.832 --> 12:44.464
ONE OF WHICH IS TELLING ME
THAT I HAVE TO DO HERNIA REPAIRS

12:44.464 --> 12:46.166
USING THEIR
STUPID VARNER TECHNIQUE.

12:46.166 --> 12:47.497
NOW I HAVE
A HERNIA REPAIR TODAY.

12:47.497 --> 12:49.169
I WOULD LIKE TO DO IT
THE WAY I'VE BEEN

12:49.169 --> 12:51.501
SUCCESSFULLY DOING IT SINCE YOU
WERE SUCKING YOUR THUMB.

12:51.501 --> 12:52.873
WE'LL LOOK AT THAT.

12:52.873 --> 12:54.174
WELL, WHEN?

12:54.174 --> 12:57.107
THERE'S ALL SORTS OF
IDIOTIC RULES HERE,

12:57.107 --> 13:00.410
LIKE THE O.R. LAYOUT
AND ORGAN TRANSPORTS,

13:00.410 --> 13:01.551
BARIATRIC CENTERS.

13:01.551 --> 13:03.253
ISN'T THAT WHY
YOU'RE THE BOSS NOW,

13:03.253 --> 13:04.955
SO THE PLACE
WON'T BE RUN BY IDIOTS?

13:04.955 --> 13:06.156
THANK YOU, BAILEY.

13:06.156 --> 13:07.487
YOU'RE WELCOME, BOSS.

13:07.487 --> 13:08.989
HEY, HAVE YOU GUYS SEEN
CHIEF HUNT?

13:08.989 --> 13:11.161
I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHY HE
SIGNED A DEATH WARRANT

13:11.161 --> 13:12.792
ON ONE OF MY PATIENTS.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.424
WELL, GOOD LUCK.
HE'S GONE. HE QUIT.

13:14.424 --> 13:16.366
HE... WHAT? HUNT?

13:16.366 --> 13:17.968
ASK BOSS MAN OVER HERE.

13:17.968 --> 13:19.129
(elevator bell dings)

13:19.129 --> 13:20.931
THERE WAS A DISAGREEMENT
ABOUT POLICY.

13:20.931 --> 13:22.432
YEAH, WELL, THEN CHANGE
THE STUPID POLICY.

13:22.432 --> 13:24.434
UNH-UNH, NOT BEFORE HE CHANGES
MY STUPID POLICY FIRST.

13:24.434 --> 13:26.806
MY HERNIA'S THIS AFTERNOON.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.578
(huffs)

13:28.578 --> 13:31.211
THEY'RE GOING TO GET
THE DONOR HEART AND LUNG

13:31.211 --> 13:32.542
AS WE SPEAK.

13:32.542 --> 13:34.514
WE SHOULD HAVE YOU IN THE O.R.
SOMETIME THIS AFTERNOON.

13:34.514 --> 13:36.186
OH, NOT A MINUTE TOO SOON.

13:36.186 --> 13:38.418
YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN
WHAT I COUGHED UP THIS MORNING.

13:38.418 --> 13:40.250
I SWEAR TO GOD,
THE THING HAD HANDS.

13:40.250 --> 13:42.292
(groans) DR. YANG.

13:42.292 --> 13:44.254
I WAS HOPING I'D CATCH YOU.

13:44.254 --> 13:47.557
HEY, YOU GET YOUR FAT HEAD
OUT OF MY DOOR.

13:47.557 --> 13:49.960
BAD ENOUGH I GOTTA WATCH YOU
GO BY MY WINDOW

13:49.960 --> 13:53.403
80 TIMES A DAY WHILE YOU WALK
YOUR STUPID LAPS.

13:53.403 --> 13:55.435
I JUST WANT TO KNOW
IF DR. YANG KNOWS

13:55.435 --> 13:58.338
ABOUT THE PEPPERONI PIZZA
YOU'VE BEEN SMUGGLING IN HERE.

13:58.338 --> 13:59.509
SNITCH ALL YOU WANT.

13:59.509 --> 14:01.972
I'M NOT GONNA BE HERE
MUCH LONGER.

14:01.972 --> 14:03.313
NO KIDDING?
YOU'RE DYING.

14:03.313 --> 14:06.046
HEY, THERE IS A GOD,
AND HE'S HEARD MY PRAYERS.

14:06.046 --> 14:08.979
UH, MR. SCHULZ IS GETTING
A HEART-LUNG TRANSPLANT.

14:08.979 --> 14:10.580
A HEART?

14:10.580 --> 14:12.482
WELL,
HE DOESN'T NEED A HEART.

14:12.482 --> 14:14.624
HE'S GOT JUNKY LUNGS.

14:14.624 --> 14:16.356
I'VE BEEN ON THIS MACHINE
FOR THREE MONTHS,

14:16.356 --> 14:18.858
AND YOU'RE GIVING
THAT BASTARD MY HEART?
(elevator bell dings)

14:18.858 --> 14:20.390
YOU'RE NOT LOOKING
TOO GOOD, HERMAN.

14:20.390 --> 14:22.332
SOMEBODY MIGHT BE DYING TODAY.

14:22.332 --> 14:23.493
SHUT UP.

14:23.493 --> 14:24.494
MR. CRUMP,
PLEASE CALM DOWN.

14:24.494 --> 14:26.166
MR. SCHULZ'S HEART
IS COMPROMISED

14:26.166 --> 14:29.269
BECAUSE OF THE STRESS CAUSED BY
HIS PULMONARY HYPERTENSION.

14:29.269 --> 14:31.141
SO A HEART-LUNG TRANSPLANT
IS THE--

14:31.141 --> 14:32.442
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
PULMONARY HYPERTENSION

14:32.442 --> 14:34.474
UNLESS YOU GET
A SUPERVISOR DOWN HERE.

14:34.474 --> 14:36.506
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

14:36.506 --> 14:37.948
A SUPERVISOR, NOW!

14:37.948 --> 14:39.279
ABSOLUTELY. RIGHT AWAY.

14:39.279 --> 14:40.580
YEAH.

14:40.580 --> 14:42.382
(grunts)

14:42.382 --> 14:44.614
SO WHY DO THEY
HATE EACH OTHER SO MUCH?

14:44.614 --> 14:46.156
THEY WERE NEIGHBORS.

14:46.156 --> 14:48.118
CRUMP'S WIFE LEFT HIM
FOR SCHULZ, LIKE, 30 YEARS AGO.

14:48.118 --> 14:49.289
NO.

14:49.289 --> 14:50.590
YES. SHE ENDED UP
LEAVING HIM, TOO,

14:50.590 --> 14:52.522
FOR SOME OTHER GUY
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

14:52.522 --> 14:54.224
NO.
YES.

14:54.224 --> 14:55.395
NO.

14:55.395 --> 14:56.596
CAN YOUR MIND BE BLOWN
ON YOUR OWN TIME?

14:56.596 --> 15:00.100
RIGHT NOW I HAVE TO TALK
WITH MY SUPERVISOR.

15:00.100 --> 15:02.472
UM, WELL,
YOU OWN THE HOSPITAL NOW.

15:02.472 --> 15:04.935
SO DOESN'T THAT MAKE YOU
THE SUPERVISOR?

15:04.935 --> 15:06.236
IT DOES.

15:06.236 --> 15:09.179
SO I WILL HAVE
THAT CONVERSATION WITH MYSELF.

15:09.179 --> 15:12.212
WELL, SHOULD I, LIKE,
STICK AROUND FOR THAT OR...

15:12.212 --> 15:14.114
OH.

15:14.114 --> 15:15.445
YOU'RE PUSHING
ALL OF OUR SURGERIES?

15:15.445 --> 15:17.087
THERE'S NO PLACE TO DO THEM.

15:17.087 --> 15:20.120
MER, I NEED YOU TO DO A KIDNEY
PROCUREMENT IN MISSOULA.

15:20.120 --> 15:22.292
I GOTTA STAY HERE
AND DO THE TRANSPLANT,

15:22.292 --> 15:24.024
AND ROBBINS IS IN SURGERY.

15:24.024 --> 15:25.395
I CAN'T. HUNT IS GONE,

15:25.395 --> 15:26.626
AND I HAVE TO SORT OUT WHERE
ALL THESE PATIENTS ARE GOING.

15:26.626 --> 15:28.228
COME ON. I'M NOT GONNA RISK
SOME MISSOULA HACK

15:28.228 --> 15:29.399
SCREWING UP THE DISSECTION

15:29.399 --> 15:31.131
AND GIVING ME
SOME UNUSABLE KIDNEY.

15:31.131 --> 15:34.064
JAELYNN GOT A KIDNEY?
CAN I DO ANYTHING?

15:34.064 --> 15:36.466
I SAID I NEED A SURGEON.
YOU'RE NOT A SURGEON YET.

15:36.466 --> 15:38.508
(elevator bell dings)
AND I FORGOT.
NEITHER ARE YOU.

15:38.508 --> 15:41.011
UPPER MANAGEMENT'S TOO BUSY
TO GET A KID A KIDNEY.

15:41.011 --> 15:42.172
(slaps countertop)

15:42.172 --> 15:43.513
(woman) DR. IMMERMAN
TO PEDS I.C.U.

15:43.513 --> 15:45.015
DR. IMMERMAN TO PEDS I.C.U.

15:45.015 --> 15:46.616
(sighs)

15:46.616 --> 15:49.449
CALL DR. SHEPHERD
AND ASK HIM TO FIX THIS BOARD,

15:49.449 --> 15:52.652
AND BOOK ME A PLANE
TO MISSOULA.

15:52.652 --> 15:56.526
THE PATIENT'S THIS
REALLY SWEET KID...

15:56.526 --> 15:59.159
WHATEVER.
YOU CAN COME, TOO.

15:59.159 --> 16:01.161
(people speak indistinctly)

16:01.161 --> 16:04.294
(coughing)

16:04.294 --> 16:06.266
I-I'VE HEARD YOUR PLAN,

16:06.266 --> 16:08.368
BUT YOU STILL
HAVEN'T HEARD MINE.

16:08.368 --> 16:10.600
I CAN SEE NOT WANTING
A COLONOSCOPY,

16:10.600 --> 16:12.342
BUT THAT'S NOT
THE ONLY OPTION.

16:12.342 --> 16:15.645
WE COULD DO RADIONUCLIDE SCANS,
ANGIOGRAPHY.

16:15.645 --> 16:18.448
I MEAN, THERE'S A-A BUNCH
OF ENDOSCOPIC PROCEDURES

16:18.448 --> 16:19.749
THAT WE COULD TRY.

16:19.749 --> 16:21.481
THIS IS WHY

16:21.481 --> 16:24.254
I DIDN'T TELL YOU.

16:24.254 --> 16:25.715
I KNEW YOU'D DISAGREE.

16:25.715 --> 16:29.519
AND I DIDN'T WANT TO
HAVE TO SPEND VALUABLE MINUTES

16:29.519 --> 16:31.621
OF MY LIFE

16:31.621 --> 16:33.123
CONVINCING YOU.

16:33.123 --> 16:34.464
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

16:34.464 --> 16:36.696
(ventilator whirring)

16:36.696 --> 16:39.299
(chair wheels rattle)

16:41.471 --> 16:42.732
YOU'RE DEPRESSED,

16:42.732 --> 16:44.434
BUT WE CAN TREAT THAT.

16:44.434 --> 16:46.536
I'M NOT.

16:46.536 --> 16:48.508
I'M...

16:48.508 --> 16:51.381
A.L.S...

16:51.381 --> 16:55.285
IS 100% FATAL.

16:55.285 --> 16:57.587
IF I DONATE MY ORGANS,

16:57.587 --> 17:01.251
MY DEATH CAN MEAN SOMETHING.

17:01.251 --> 17:03.453
IF I KEEP FIGHTING,

17:03.453 --> 17:06.056
I GET AN INFECTION

17:06.056 --> 17:07.797
AND CAN'T DONATE.

17:07.797 --> 17:10.230
I'VE DECIDED

17:10.230 --> 17:11.461
TO STOP FIGHTING IT.

17:11.461 --> 17:13.032
SO...

17:13.032 --> 17:14.534
WE'RE EXTRA CAREFUL

17:14.534 --> 17:16.536
AND WE JUST MAKE SURE

17:16.536 --> 17:18.037
THAT YOU DON'T GET
AN INFECTION.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.039
COME ON.
PLEASE LET ME HELP YOU.

17:20.039 --> 17:22.342
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO LOVE YOU,

17:22.342 --> 17:24.744
WHO NEED YOU.

17:24.744 --> 17:28.548
COME ON. YOU--
YOU ARE STILL ALIVE

17:28.548 --> 17:30.250
AND SO...

17:30.250 --> 17:31.651
(sighs) SO YOU.

17:38.358 --> 17:40.560
APRIL.

17:40.560 --> 17:43.493
YES.

17:43.493 --> 17:45.635
YOU'RE FIRED.

17:53.203 --> 17:54.604
THIS IS WHERE YOU SHOULD
CHECK YOUR MEDS OFF EVERY DAY.

17:54.604 --> 17:55.805
OKAY?

17:55.805 --> 17:57.207
YOU'LL START YOUR MORNINGS
WITH PREDNISOLONE

17:57.207 --> 17:58.548
AND MYCOPHENOLATE
AT 8:00 A.M.

17:58.548 --> 18:01.551
THEN FOLLOW THAT WITH,
UH, FK-506 AT 10:00 A.M.

18:01.551 --> 18:03.683
AND 10:00 P.M.--
THOSE ARE FOR EVERY DAY.

18:03.683 --> 18:05.315
THEN YOU'LL ALSO BE
ON TRIMETHOPRIM-SULFA

18:05.315 --> 18:06.656
THREE TIMES A WEEK.

18:06.656 --> 18:08.218
NOW YOU'RE
JUST MAKING UP WORDS.

18:08.218 --> 18:10.660
LOOK, YOU HAVE TO TAKE THEM
NO MATTER WHAT, ALL RIGHT?

18:10.660 --> 18:12.792
OR YOU'LL LOSE THE KIDNEY.
YOU CAN'T MISS A DOSE.

18:12.792 --> 18:14.294
SHE WON'T.

18:16.566 --> 18:18.868
FINE. I'LL DO
WHATEVER YOU JUST SAID.

18:18.868 --> 18:20.570
OKAY, THE MEDS,
UH, THEY CAN CAUSE

18:20.570 --> 18:23.273
PRETTY DRAMATIC MOOD SWINGS,
UH, HAIR THINNING, WEIGHT GAIN,

18:23.273 --> 18:24.674
DIARRHEA, ACNE.

18:24.674 --> 18:26.206
I MEAN,
THEY DON'T ALWAYS HAPPEN,

18:26.206 --> 18:27.507
BUT IF THEY DO,
DON'T BE ALARMED.

18:27.507 --> 18:30.810
(people speaking indistinctly)

18:30.810 --> 18:32.242
(bottles clink)

18:32.242 --> 18:34.584
IF YOU WERE DYING,
WOULD YOU DONATE YOUR ORGANS?

18:34.584 --> 18:35.545
OF COURSE.

18:35.545 --> 18:36.886
EVEN IF YOU STILL HAD TIME?

18:36.886 --> 18:40.350
MM. THIS THE D.C.D. GUY?

18:40.350 --> 18:42.822
I HAVE A PLAN. HE JUST
WON'T EVEN LISTEN TO IT.

18:42.822 --> 18:44.624
YOU KNOW, HE'S A DOCTOR.
HE KNOWS THE DEAL.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.726
HE'S NOT GONNA GET
ANY BETTER.
YEAH, BUT--

18:46.726 --> 18:47.857
HE'S GONNA SAVE
A CRAPLOAD OF PEOPLE.

18:47.857 --> 18:49.429
I THINK IT'S AWESOME.

18:49.429 --> 18:52.632
HE'S GOT PERFECTLY GOOD ORGANS.
MIGHT AS WELL USE THEM.

18:52.632 --> 18:54.604
(sighs)

18:54.604 --> 18:56.266
OH, MY GOD.

18:56.266 --> 18:58.238
HE HAS GOOD ORGANS.

18:58.238 --> 19:00.510
THAT IS GENIUS.
I AM A GENIUS.

19:00.510 --> 19:02.472
(telephone rings)

19:02.472 --> 19:05.175
(exhales)

19:05.175 --> 19:07.347
SO YOU'LL HAVE TO
PICK UP ZOLA.

19:07.347 --> 19:09.479
DID YOU SORT OUT
THE O.R. BOARD?

19:09.479 --> 19:11.321
I STARTED,
BUT I HAVE A SURGERY.

19:11.321 --> 19:12.782
I HAVE TORRES
LOOKING AT IT RIGHT NOW.

19:12.782 --> 19:14.484
WHY ARE YOU ON A PLANE?

19:14.484 --> 19:17.156
Oh, because Alex wants
his kid's kidney

19:17.156 --> 19:18.488
MOBILIZED BEFORE PERFUSION,

19:18.488 --> 19:20.390
AND HE'S BEING A GIANT BABY
ABOUT IT.

19:20.390 --> 19:22.262
ALL RIGHT. WELL, CALL ME
WHEN YOU GET BACK.
Okay.

19:22.262 --> 19:23.563
(cell phone beeps)

19:23.563 --> 19:26.336
HE DOESN'T MEAN TO BE
A GIANT BABY.

19:26.336 --> 19:28.338
KAREV--I THINK HE JUST
HATES FEELING LIKE

19:28.338 --> 19:30.169
YOU GUYS LEFT HIM
IN THE DARK.

19:30.169 --> 19:32.772
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TEACH ME
HOW TO SPEAK ALEX. I'M FLUENT.

19:32.772 --> 19:34.674
(sighs) I'M JUST LEARNING.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.746
(clears throat)

19:36.746 --> 19:38.248
I SHOULDN'T
TAKE IT PERSONALLY

19:38.248 --> 19:40.850
THAT HE'S ACTING LIKE
HE HATES ME, RIGHT?

19:40.850 --> 19:43.753
I MEAN,
HE'S JUST FEELING ABANDONED

19:43.753 --> 19:45.655
BY EVERYONE IN HIS LIFE
RIGHT NOW,

19:45.655 --> 19:47.657
AND THE FACT THAT I'M DATING
A GUY AND NOT AVAILABLE

19:47.657 --> 19:49.789
TO GO TO JOE'S BAR
EVERY NIGHT IS JUST--

19:49.789 --> 19:51.861
HE'S FEELING HURT

19:51.861 --> 19:55.395
AND LONELY.

19:55.395 --> 19:56.566
OR HE HATES YOU.

19:56.566 --> 19:58.228
THANKS.

19:58.228 --> 19:59.769
YOU'RE WELCOME.

19:59.769 --> 20:01.501
(engine whirs)

20:01.501 --> 20:02.972
WHAT'S WRONG?

20:02.972 --> 20:04.774
SHE LOCKED HERSELF IN THERE.

20:04.774 --> 20:07.607
JAELYNN, SWEETIE.
IT'S OKAY. COME ON OUT.

20:07.607 --> 20:08.938
(knocks)

20:08.938 --> 20:10.910
JAELYNN,
IT'S DR. KAREV.

20:10.910 --> 20:12.582
LOOK, JAELYNN, COME ON.
I KNOW IT'S SCARY.

20:12.582 --> 20:13.743
JUST COME OUT
AND WE'LL TALK.

20:13.743 --> 20:15.585
YOU CAN ASK ME
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

20:15.585 --> 20:17.747
IT'S THE SILENT TREATMENT.

20:17.747 --> 20:18.718
SHE WON'T CRACK.

20:18.718 --> 20:20.420
ONCE WE TOOK HER PHONE
FROM HER.

20:20.420 --> 20:22.292
SHE DIDN'T SPEAK TO US
FOR SEVEN DAYS.

20:22.292 --> 20:23.593
(cell phone chimes)

20:23.593 --> 20:24.754
(chime)

20:24.754 --> 20:27.697
OH, SHE'S TALKING
TO SOMEBODY.

20:29.599 --> 20:33.403
(clicking,
people speaking indistinctly)

20:33.403 --> 20:35.605
SHE TEXTING YOU?
MAYBE.

20:35.605 --> 20:36.966
TELL HER TO COME OUT
OF THE BATHROOM.

20:36.966 --> 20:38.638
I DON'T TELL HER
WHAT TO DO.

20:38.638 --> 20:39.609
JUST DO IT.

20:39.609 --> 20:41.741
MAKE ME.

20:41.741 --> 20:42.942
ARE YOU FOR REAL?

20:42.942 --> 20:44.674
"DR. D.F."?

20:44.674 --> 20:45.775
DR. DOUCHE FACE.

20:45.775 --> 20:46.976
WHO'S THAT SUPPOSED TO BE?

20:46.976 --> 20:48.878
WHO DO YOU THINK?
NOW GIVE IT BACK.

20:48.878 --> 20:50.249
(snaps)

20:50.249 --> 20:51.721
MAKE ME.

20:51.721 --> 20:54.324
(Heather) IT'S CALLED
A DOMINO TRANSPLANT.

20:54.324 --> 20:55.655
BECAUSE YOU GUYS ARE
THE SAME BLOOD TYPE,

20:55.655 --> 20:58.858
WE WILL PUT THE NEW HEART
AND LUNGS INTO MR. SCHULZ,

20:58.858 --> 21:01.030
AND THEN TAKE MR. SCHULZ'S
ORIGINAL HEART

21:01.030 --> 21:02.632
AND GIVE IT TO MR. CRUMP.

21:02.632 --> 21:05.395
SO HIS HEART IN MY BODY?

21:05.395 --> 21:06.636
NOTHING DOING.

21:06.636 --> 21:08.738
IT--IT'S THE BEST SOLUTION
IN THIS CASE.

21:08.738 --> 21:10.600
THE BEST SOLUTION IS
A 62 YEAR OLD

21:10.600 --> 21:12.772
GETTING A 70-YEAR-OLD'S
HAND-ME-DOWNS?

21:12.772 --> 21:16.606
TECHNICALLY, ALL DONOR HEARTS
ARE HAND-ME-DOWNS.

21:16.606 --> 21:18.778
MR. SCHULZ'S HEART
IS 80% FUNCTIONAL.

21:18.778 --> 21:19.979
YOURS IS ONLY 10%.

21:19.979 --> 21:21.851
YEAH,
YOU HEAR THAT? 80%.

21:21.851 --> 21:24.013
YOU'D BE LUCKY TO GET
A TICKER LIKE THIS ONE.

21:24.013 --> 21:25.715
I'D BE LUCKY IF
YOU DROPPED DEAD RIGHT NOW

21:25.715 --> 21:26.986
AND I GOT THE FRESH HEART.

21:26.986 --> 21:28.488
MR. CRUMP, YOU SHOULD
REALLY CONSIDER THIS OP--

21:28.488 --> 21:29.819
LOOK, I WOULD RATHER CROAK

21:29.819 --> 21:32.722
THAN HAVE THIS BASTARD'S
OLD LUMP OF MEAT IN MY CHEST.

21:32.722 --> 21:34.063
HEY.

21:34.063 --> 21:36.596
THIS DAY JUST KEEPS
GETTING BETTER AND BETTER.

21:36.596 --> 21:38.398
YEAH, RIGHT. IT'S GREAT.

21:38.398 --> 21:39.699
OKAY, SIR.
YOU NEED TO SIT DOWN.

21:39.699 --> 21:40.970
NO, I NEED TO GET
OUT OF THIS ROOM.

21:40.970 --> 21:42.772
SIR, CALM DOWN. JUST--
PLEASE. GET OUT OF MY--

21:42.772 --> 21:44.073
(people speak indistinctly)

21:44.073 --> 21:45.905
SO HE'S REJECTING THE HEART
OUT OF SPITE?

21:45.905 --> 21:47.437
(Cristina) Yeah.

21:47.437 --> 21:49.078
I CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO
TALK HIM INTO TAKING IT.

21:49.078 --> 21:50.440
HAVE YOU TALKED TO OWEN?

21:50.440 --> 21:51.741
Uh, no. But I know him.

21:51.741 --> 21:52.782
HE JUST NEEDS TIME.

21:52.782 --> 21:54.414
WHAT IS YOUR HUSBAND'S DEAL
ANYWAY?

21:54.414 --> 21:55.645
OH, CRISTINA.

21:55.645 --> 21:57.717
You know, it's like everyone
has gone crazy.

21:57.717 --> 21:59.419
OWEN AND DEREK ARE
AT EACH OTHER'S THROATS.

21:59.419 --> 22:00.890
AVERY'S ON SOME KIND
OF POWER TRIP.

22:00.890 --> 22:04.023
YOU KNOW, I AM SUPPOSED TO BE
PREPPING FOR A MAJOR TRANSPLANT,

22:04.023 --> 22:05.855
AND CALLIE'S LEFT ME
WITH AN O.R. BOARD

22:05.855 --> 22:07.026
THAT'S LIKE A RUBIK'S CUBE.

22:07.026 --> 22:08.658
Wow. In charge one day,

22:08.658 --> 22:10.059
and already the hospital's
spinning out of control?

22:10.059 --> 22:11.431
Okay, I gotta go.

22:11.431 --> 22:12.762
WE'RE HERE.
(cell phone beeps)

22:12.762 --> 22:13.933
UH, YOU NEED TO STOP LISTENING
TO MY CONVERSATIONS.

22:13.933 --> 22:15.765
IS THE PLACE REALLY SPINNING
OUT OF CONTROL?

22:15.765 --> 22:18.107
WHAT? NO, OF COURSE NOT.
SHUT UP.

22:18.107 --> 22:20.710
EVERYTHING'S PERFECTLY FINE.

22:20.710 --> 22:22.612
(sighs)

22:22.612 --> 22:24.414
WHERE IS EVERYBODY?

22:24.414 --> 22:25.745
(clicks)

22:25.745 --> 22:27.917
THEY'VE GONE.
WE'RE PRETTY MUCH DONE HERE.

22:27.917 --> 22:30.620
WHAT DO YOU MEAN DONE?
WHERE'S OUR KIDNEY?

22:30.620 --> 22:32.121
(instrument clatters)

22:32.121 --> 22:34.524
WHY DO YOU LOOK CONFUSED?

22:34.524 --> 22:37.086
WHERE IS OUR KIDNEY?

22:43.493 --> 22:44.664
HANDS OFF MY KIDNEY!

22:44.664 --> 22:45.835
I'M TELLING YOU,
THIS ISN'T YOUR KIDNEY.

22:45.835 --> 22:46.896
AND I'M TELLING YOU,

22:46.896 --> 22:48.367
SHOW ME THE PAPERWORK
TO PROVE THAT,

22:48.367 --> 22:49.539
OR I'M GONNA REACH DOWN
YOUR THROAT

22:49.539 --> 22:50.740
AND TAKE ONE OF YOURS.

22:50.740 --> 22:51.901
(door opens)

22:51.901 --> 22:53.072
I FOUND OUR KIDNEY.

22:53.072 --> 22:54.804
GREAT. NOW CALL OFF
YOUR ATTACK DOG.

22:54.804 --> 22:55.905
WILSON, STAND DOWN.

22:55.905 --> 22:57.747
WHERE IS IT?
IT HOPPED A FLIGHT TO SEATTLE.

22:57.747 --> 22:58.878
ALL BY ITSELF?
HOW'D IT DO THAT?

22:58.878 --> 23:00.710
I DON'T KNOW.
WE GOTTA GET HOME. COME ON.

23:00.710 --> 23:01.951
(sighs)
LET'S GO.

23:01.951 --> 23:03.813
(door opens)

23:03.813 --> 23:05.655
(people speak indistinctly)

23:05.655 --> 23:06.886
(clicking)

23:06.886 --> 23:08.758
YOU SENT HER AN EMOTICON
OF A BEE AND AN ICE CUBE?

23:08.758 --> 23:09.959
(dings)
IT MEANS "BE CHILL"

23:09.959 --> 23:11.721
AND COME OUT OF THE BATHROOM.

23:11.721 --> 23:13.923
(cell phone chimes)

23:13.923 --> 23:15.465
I KNOW IT'S YOU.

23:15.465 --> 23:16.796
THEO WOULD NEVER
TEXT EMOTICONS.

23:16.796 --> 23:18.898
JUST... (sighs)
GIVE ME FIVE MINUTES,

23:18.898 --> 23:22.432
AND THEN I WILL NEVER
BOTHER YOU ABOUT IT AGAIN.

23:22.432 --> 23:26.706
OKAY. FIVE MINUTES,
BUT IN HERE.

23:31.541 --> 23:34.083
I KNOW YOU'RE SCARED,
BUT YOU NEED THIS KIDNEY.

23:34.083 --> 23:36.115
AT LEAST WITH DIALYSIS,
I WON'T GO BALD,

23:36.115 --> 23:37.817
GET FAT,
AND POOP MY PANTS.

23:37.817 --> 23:39.749
THAT'S NOT THE SOLUTION,
AND YOU KNOW IT.

23:39.749 --> 23:42.592
CAN'T I, LIKE,
TAKE THE NEXT ONE?

23:42.592 --> 23:45.495
I'M, LIKE,
NOT READY FOR THIS.

23:45.495 --> 23:47.196
YES, YOU ARE.

23:47.196 --> 23:48.828
(sighs) LOOK,

23:48.828 --> 23:50.930
JAELYNN, UM,

23:50.930 --> 23:52.462
THERE'S THIS GIRL,

23:52.462 --> 23:54.734
AND I DIDN'T TELL HER
THAT I WAS INTO HER,

23:54.734 --> 23:57.206
AND NOW SHE'S WITH SOME DUDE
WITH BIG ARMS.

23:57.206 --> 23:59.709
UM, ARE YOU, LIKE,
HITTING ON ME?

23:59.709 --> 24:01.841
'CAUSE YOU'RE, LIKE, OLD.

24:01.841 --> 24:02.872
GOD. (chuckles) NO. NO.

24:02.872 --> 24:04.574
NO, MY--MY P-POINT IS,

24:04.574 --> 24:07.446
IS THAT THIS--THIS KIDNEY
IS A GOOD THING,

24:07.446 --> 24:08.918
AND THAT YOU NEED TO TAKE
THE GOOD THINGS

24:08.918 --> 24:10.620
WHEN THEY'RE IN FRONT OF YOU,

24:10.620 --> 24:12.622
BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T,
SOMEONE ELSE WILL.

24:12.622 --> 24:15.154
SO YOU'RE SAYING,
TAKE THIS KIDNEY

24:15.154 --> 24:18.828
SO SOME DUDE WITH BIG ARMS
DOESN'T GET IT?

24:18.828 --> 24:20.560
YEAH.

24:27.537 --> 24:29.569
LET'S GET HER PREPPED.

24:29.569 --> 24:32.101
(lowered voice)
DON'T LEAVE HER SIDE.

24:32.101 --> 24:34.574
GOT IT.

24:38.648 --> 24:39.809
(cell phone beeps)

24:39.809 --> 24:41.180
HEY. HOW'S IT LOOKING?

24:41.180 --> 24:42.812
(Meredith) You sent me all
the way out here to get a kidney

24:42.812 --> 24:44.654
THAT'S ALREADY FLYING COACH
TO SEATTLE

24:44.654 --> 24:46.255
AS AN UNACCOMPANIED MINOR?

24:46.255 --> 24:48.087
WHAT?
I don't even know who's coming
to pick it up.

24:48.087 --> 24:49.759
FIND OUT.
Alex, I--

24:49.759 --> 24:51.791
LOOK, JUST DEAL WITH IT,
OKAY?

24:51.791 --> 24:53.763
(engine whirs,
indistinct radio chatter)

24:53.763 --> 24:55.695
(indistinct conversations)

24:55.695 --> 24:58.027
ARE YOU OKAY THERE?
YOU LOOK A LITTLE OVERWHELMED.

24:58.027 --> 24:59.599
ANYTHING I CAN HELP YOU WITH?

24:59.599 --> 25:01.200
CAN YOU READ EVERYTHING IN
MY ARMS AND OWN THIS HOSPITAL?

25:01.200 --> 25:03.232
YOU ACTUALLY GONNA LOOK
AT THOSE PROTOCOLS

25:03.232 --> 25:05.074
OR JUST KEEP
CARRYING 'EM AROUND?

25:05.074 --> 25:06.806
RIGHT. YOUR HERNIA.
I'M GONNA GET YOU AN ANSWER

25:06.806 --> 25:08.808
JUST AS SOON AS I--
TOO LATE.
I ALREADY DID IT,

25:08.808 --> 25:10.710
MY WAY.
THAT'S NOT--
BAILEY, YOU SHOULDN'T--

25:10.710 --> 25:12.181
WELL, YOU COULDN'T MAKE
A DECISION,

25:12.181 --> 25:13.643
SO I MADE IT MYSELF.

25:13.643 --> 25:15.084
YOU GONNA GET RID OF ME NOW
LIKE YOU DID HUNT?

25:15.084 --> 25:17.246
I DIDN'T GET RID OF HUNT.
WHY--
SIGN THIS.

25:17.246 --> 25:18.618
WHAT IS THIS?

25:18.618 --> 25:19.789
AUTHORIZATION
FOR A DOMINO TRANSPLANT.

25:19.789 --> 25:20.890
YES, WHY AM I--

25:20.890 --> 25:22.251
BECAUSE WHEN YOU
ANOINT YOURSELF KING,

25:22.251 --> 25:23.723
IT COMES WITH
CERTAIN RESPONSIBILITIES.

25:23.723 --> 25:25.094
YOU HAVE TO SIGN THIS.

25:25.094 --> 25:26.726
I NEED TO KNOW
WHAT THIS IS FIRST.

25:26.726 --> 25:28.197
WELL, I COULD TAKE THE TIME
TO EXPLAIN TO YOU

25:28.197 --> 25:29.859
HOW A HEART-LUNG
DOMINO TRANSPLANT WORKS,

25:29.859 --> 25:31.661
BUT BY THEN,
BOTH MY PATIENTS WILL BE DEAD.

25:31.661 --> 25:33.202
I KNOW HOW
A DAMN DOMINO WORKS.

25:33.202 --> 25:35.104
HEY, APRIL.
HERE, TAKE THESE.

25:35.104 --> 25:36.706
WHAT ARE THEY?

25:36.706 --> 25:38.007
HUNT LEFT BEFORE HE COULD
COORDINATE THE RECOVERY TEAMS

25:38.007 --> 25:39.538
FOR YOUR D.C.D. PATIENT.

25:39.538 --> 25:40.840
SO IT'S JUST A LIST OF
WHICH ORGANS ARE GOING WHERE.

25:40.840 --> 25:43.072
YEAH, WELL, HE'S NOT
MY PATIENT ANYMORE,

25:43.072 --> 25:44.874
PER HIS REQUEST--
JUST SIGN THIS.

25:44.874 --> 25:47.717
JUST HANDLE IT, PLEASE.

25:47.717 --> 25:48.818
(clicks pen)

25:48.818 --> 25:50.279
HEY, MAKE SURE YOU SIGN
YOUR OWN NAME,

25:50.279 --> 25:51.821
NOT YOUR MOM'S.
(elevator bell dings)

25:51.821 --> 25:52.952
(Cristina) OOH.
REALLY?

25:52.952 --> 25:54.884
(Alex) AVERY.
WHAT?

25:54.884 --> 25:55.855
I WANT TO KNOW WHO THE HELL
SENT MY KIDNEY

25:55.855 --> 25:57.026
FLYING COACH TO SEATTLE

25:57.026 --> 25:58.788
WHEN I SENT TWO SURGEONS
TO PICK IT UP.

25:58.788 --> 26:00.259
WAIT.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

26:00.259 --> 26:01.761
HE'S TALKING ABOUT
THE PROTOCOLS.

26:01.761 --> 26:03.092
LOOK...

26:03.092 --> 26:05.835
PEGASUS POLICY STATES,
LOOK,

26:05.835 --> 26:09.238
"DONATED KIDNEYS COMING
FROM OUTSIDE A CERTAIN RADIUS

26:09.238 --> 26:10.770
"WILL BE FLOWN UNACCOMPANIED,

26:10.770 --> 26:11.971
SAVING PERSONNEL HOURS."

26:11.971 --> 26:13.673
SO WHEN
THE OTHER HOSPITAL CALLED,

26:13.673 --> 26:15.144
THE NURSE JUST TOLD 'EM
TO PUT IT ON A PLANE.

26:15.144 --> 26:16.305
TOLD YOU THEY WERE
STUPID RULES.

26:16.305 --> 26:17.647
YOU SHOULD READ 'EM
SOMETIME.

26:17.647 --> 26:18.808
OH, GREAT.

26:18.808 --> 26:20.109
DOES ANYBODY KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON?

26:20.109 --> 26:21.651
(indistinct conversations
continue)

26:21.651 --> 26:22.982
TOUGH DAY, BOSS?

26:22.982 --> 26:24.153
(elevator bell dings)

26:24.153 --> 26:25.715
(Richard) HE IS DROWNING,

26:25.715 --> 26:27.016
AND HE IS TAKING
MY HOSPITAL DOWN WITH HIM.

26:27.016 --> 26:28.818
WHERE IS ALL THIS DRAMA
COMING FROM?

26:28.818 --> 26:30.720
HE WILL HANDLE THIS.
JUST GIVE HIM TIME.

26:30.720 --> 26:31.991
HE'S PARALYZED.

26:31.991 --> 26:33.693
DECISIONS ARE LIKE
BUILDING BLOCKS.

26:33.693 --> 26:35.725
HE'LL MAKE ONE,
THEN ANOTHER WILL FOLLOW.

26:35.725 --> 26:37.026
YOU DO NOT DO THIS JOB

26:37.026 --> 26:39.368
ONE CALMLY THOUGHT-OUT
DECISION AT A TIME.

26:39.368 --> 26:41.100
YOU'RE SPINNING PLATES,
TEN AT A TIME,

26:41.100 --> 26:42.371
AND YOU'RE DOING IT
AT A SPRINT.

26:42.371 --> 26:43.733
HE WILL GET THERE.

26:43.733 --> 26:44.904
YOU ACT LIKE I DON'T HAVE
ANY IDEA

26:44.904 --> 26:46.205
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

26:46.205 --> 26:48.708
WHEN I WAS CHIEF, I WORKED
HAND IN HAND WITH THE BOARD.

26:48.708 --> 26:49.839
SO I KNOW WHAT IT TAKES TO--

26:49.839 --> 26:51.340
YOU ARE NOT DOING IT NOW,
RICHARD.

26:51.340 --> 26:52.712
(people speaking indistinctly)

26:52.712 --> 26:55.815
I AM NOT THINKING
OF MYSELF, CATHERINE.

26:55.815 --> 26:57.346
I'M THINKING OF YOUR SON.

26:57.346 --> 26:58.888
LOOK, IF HE FAILS AT THIS,

26:58.888 --> 27:00.619
IT WILL FOLLOW HIM
HIS WHOLE LIFE.

27:00.619 --> 27:02.351
IT'LL DEFINE
HIS ENTIRE CAREER--

27:02.351 --> 27:05.624
THIS FAILURE--
AND HE DIDN'T EVEN CHOOSE IT.

27:05.624 --> 27:07.997
HIS MOTHER CHOSE IT
FOR HIM.

27:09.859 --> 27:11.661
CA--

27:12.902 --> 27:15.064
(sighs)

27:21.671 --> 27:23.312
(battery clicks,
charger beeps)

27:23.312 --> 27:25.074
(click, beeps)

27:25.074 --> 27:26.816
YOU FIND ME
A REAL HEART YET?

27:26.816 --> 27:28.117
I'VE GOT
A REAL HEART FOR YOU.

27:28.117 --> 27:29.779
YOU JUST HAVE TO
GET OVER YOURSELF.

27:29.779 --> 27:31.080
MOVE ON.

27:31.080 --> 27:33.082
WHATEVER IT IS THAT HAPPENED
BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU

27:33.082 --> 27:36.125
IS SO FAR IN THE PAST...

27:36.125 --> 27:38.828
IT'S LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY.

27:38.828 --> 27:41.090
OKAY, FINE.

27:41.090 --> 27:44.193
YOU CAN'T FORGIVE HIM.
SO DON'T.

27:44.193 --> 27:45.935
BEAT HIM.

27:45.935 --> 27:49.839
TAKE HIS PERFECTLY GOOD HEART
AND OUTLIVE HIM WITH IT.

27:49.839 --> 27:51.801
THERE'S, UH...

27:51.801 --> 27:53.873
REALLY ENOUGH JUICE
LEFT IN THAT HEART

27:53.873 --> 27:55.805
TO GET ME TO HIS FUNERAL?

27:55.805 --> 27:57.306
THERE'S ENOUGH JUICE

27:57.306 --> 27:59.749
TO GET YOU DANCING
ON HIS GRAVE.

27:59.749 --> 28:02.681
(laughs)

28:04.313 --> 28:06.956
THEN MY HEART WILL STOP.

28:06.956 --> 28:10.219
THE MONITOR WILL FLATLINE.

28:10.219 --> 28:11.891
(ventilator whirring)

28:11.891 --> 28:14.794
AND YOU GUYS WILL HAVE TO
GET OUT OF THERE.

28:14.794 --> 28:16.926
MM. BECAUSE THE DOCS...

28:16.926 --> 28:20.399
WILL ONLY HAVE FIVE MINUTES
TO OPEN ME UP

28:20.399 --> 28:24.473
OR MY ORGANS
WILL BE NO GOOD.

28:24.473 --> 28:25.905
(whirring continues)

28:25.905 --> 28:27.877
ARE YOU SURE?

28:29.038 --> 28:30.439
ARE YOU SURE?

28:32.181 --> 28:34.844
DON'T DO THIS NOW, MOM.

28:34.844 --> 28:37.216
(crying)
I KNOW IT'S SELFISH,

28:37.216 --> 28:39.849
BUT I WANT MORE MINUTES.

28:39.849 --> 28:42.251
THE CLOSER IT GETS...

28:42.251 --> 28:45.795
I WILL SUPPORT YOU
EITHER WAY.

28:45.795 --> 28:47.196
(continues crying)

28:47.196 --> 28:50.059
BUT IF YOU WANT TO STOP...

28:50.059 --> 28:53.362
WE CAN END THIS RIGHT NOW
AND GO HOME.

28:53.362 --> 28:55.004
MOM.

28:55.004 --> 28:57.266
SHE JUST WANTS TO MAKE SURE
THAT IF YOU HAVE ANY DOUBTS--

28:57.266 --> 28:58.908
YOUR SON IS STILL A DOCTOR.

28:58.908 --> 29:00.840
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

29:00.840 --> 29:02.341
AND...

29:02.341 --> 29:05.945
HE WANTS TO SAVE

29:05.945 --> 29:08.747
WHO IS GONNA GET
ONE OF HIS KIDNEYS.

29:08.747 --> 29:10.219
THE OTHER ONE IS GOING TO

29:10.219 --> 29:14.824

29:14.824 --> 29:17.226

NO, I'M IN 2.
NO, YOU'RE NOT. I AM.

31:47.036 --> 31:48.277
MOVE. I'VE GOT
A DOMINO TRANSPLANT.

31:48.277 --> 31:50.109
AND I'M GETTING A KID
OFF DIALYSIS.

31:50.109 --> 31:51.440
I CAN TOTALLY WAIT.

31:51.440 --> 31:52.982
NO, YOU CAN'T.

31:52.982 --> 31:55.414
WELL, I CAN'T. LET'S GET
THIS SHOW ON THE ROAD.

31:55.414 --> 31:56.915
THIS KID'S A FLIGHT RISK.
FIND SOMEPLACE ELSE.

31:56.915 --> 31:59.648
THIS O.R.'s THE ONLY ONE
THAT'S STAFFED.

31:59.648 --> 32:01.620
COULD YOU GUYS
PLEASE SHUT UP?

32:01.620 --> 32:02.992
MY PATIENT IS TRYING
TO DIE IN HERE,

32:02.992 --> 32:04.323
AND HE'D LIKE TO DO IT
IN SILENCE.

32:04.323 --> 32:05.955
OH, GOD. HE'S DYING
IN THERE?

32:05.955 --> 32:07.997
MAYBE YOU SHOULD GO FIRST.

32:07.997 --> 32:09.558
(Alex) HOW LONG IS HE GONNA BE?

32:09.558 --> 32:11.961
BECAUSE YANG NEEDS THE O.R.
I'VE GOT AN O.R.

32:11.961 --> 32:12.931
SHUT UP!

32:12.931 --> 32:14.233
HEY, ALL OF YOU SHUT UP.

32:14.233 --> 32:16.665
ALL RIGHT, HERE'S WHAT
YOU'RE GONNA DO...

32:16.665 --> 32:20.269
OKAY, JUST, UH,
GIVE ME ONE SECOND.

32:26.145 --> 32:28.117
KEPNER,
GO BACK TO YOUR PATIENT.

32:28.117 --> 32:30.319
HE CAN TAKE AS LONG AS HE NEEDS.
WE WILL WAIT.

32:30.319 --> 32:32.421
YANG, YOU'RE IN O.R. 2.

32:32.421 --> 32:33.952
WHAT? NO.

32:33.952 --> 32:35.084
HEART AND LUNGS TRUMP KIDNEYS.

32:35.084 --> 32:36.455
TAKE THE PATIENT
BACK TO HOLDING,

32:36.455 --> 32:37.987
AND THE NEXT O.R.
THAT'S AVAILABLE IS YOURS.

32:37.987 --> 32:39.989
YOU CAN'T--
THAT IS IT.

32:47.336 --> 32:48.637
WELL, YOU HEARD THE MAN.

32:48.637 --> 32:50.339
HE'S THE BOSS. NOW MOVE.

32:53.342 --> 32:57.006
(gurney wheels clattering)

33:04.353 --> 33:07.016
IT'S ABOUT TIME.

33:07.016 --> 33:08.517
YOU MEAN "THANK YOU, MEREDITH

33:08.517 --> 33:11.060
FOR CARRYING A KIDNEY
ACROSS STATE LINES FOR ME."

33:11.060 --> 33:12.361
WHATEVER. HAND IT OVER.

33:12.361 --> 33:13.762
(Jo) CAN I SCRUB IN?
I'D LOVE TO--

33:13.762 --> 33:15.124
I GOT MURPHY.

33:25.003 --> 33:27.076
YOU WANT ME
TO APOLOGIZE, ALEX?

33:27.076 --> 33:29.078
I'M SORRY.

33:29.078 --> 33:30.539
I'M SORRY WE BOUGHT
THE HOSPITAL.

33:30.539 --> 33:33.512
I'M SORRY YOU HAVE TO THINK
OF US AS YOUR BOSSES NOW.

33:33.512 --> 33:35.744
BUT WE DIDN'T DO IT
FOR JUST US.

33:35.744 --> 33:37.216
WE DID IT FOR EVERYONE--

33:37.216 --> 33:38.547
FOR YOU, FOR WILSON,

33:38.547 --> 33:40.549
WHO, BY THE WAY,
FOUGHT SO HARD FOR YOU TODAY,

33:40.549 --> 33:43.792
I THOUGHT SHE MIGHT CUT SOMEONE
TO GET YOU THAT KIDNEY.

33:43.792 --> 33:45.194
SO DROP THE ATTITUDE

33:45.194 --> 33:48.057
BEFORE NOBODY WANTS
TO WORK WITH YOU ANYMORE.

TO TALK ABOUT, SHEPHERD.

33:57.066 --> 33:58.207
MOVE ON.

33:58.207 --> 34:00.269
OH, COME ON.
THIS IS COSTING ME GAS.

34:00.269 --> 34:01.610
YOU CAN AFFORD IT.

34:01.610 --> 34:03.112

34:14.123 --> 34:16.655
NOBODY BLAMES YOU
FOR HIRING THE PLANE.

34:16.655 --> 34:19.388
NOT ME, NOT ANYBODY ELSE,
AND YOU SHOULDN'T EITHER.

34:19.388 --> 34:21.330
(exhales)

34:21.330 --> 34:23.061
YOU NEVER WOULD'VE SIGNED
THAT PAPER

34:23.061 --> 34:24.763

WHAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN.

34:24.763 --> 34:26.135

34:26.135 --> 34:27.296
YOU BLAME ME.

34:27.296 --> 34:28.467
(hands slap deck)

34:28.467 --> 34:29.638
YOU SAID IT, SHEPHERD.

34:29.638 --> 34:32.101
YOU SAID IT AGAIN
THIS MORNING.

34:32.101 --> 34:33.102
I WAS PISSED.

34:33.102 --> 34:36.505
I'VE BEEN PISSED,
BUT NOT AT YOU.

34:37.776 --> 34:39.608

34:39.608 --> 34:41.550

A MAN WHO CARED ABOUT JACKSON

TO THIS.

40:21.149 --> 40:22.521

WE ARE REOPENING THE E.R.

40:25.624 --> 40:28.697

40:28.697 --> 40:30.929
THAT WILL BE TOP PRIORITY

40:30.929 --> 40:34.102

WILL FOLLOW OUR LEAD.

40:37.636 --> 40:40.909

40:41.870 --> 40:44.012
YEAH.
NO, THAT SOUNDS GOOD.

40:44.012 --> 40:45.213
I'VE GOT ONE MORE THING.

40:45.213 --> 40:46.815
MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T PUSH IT.

40:46.815 --> 40:49.217
THE TRANSPLANT PROCESS
IS VERY SCARY.

40:49.217 --> 40:51.920
WE ARE BUILDING
A NEW HOSPITAL.

40:51.920 --> 40:54.683
AND THAT WAS YOUR VISION,
NOT MINE.

40:54.683 --> 40:57.826
MY PRIORITY IS TO MAKE SURE
YOUR VISION COMES TRUE.

40:57.826 --> 41:00.789
AND WHILE IT IS IMPORTANT
THAT WE BECOME

41:00.789 --> 41:02.791
A LEADING CENTER FOR RESEARCH
AND INNOVATION,

41:02.791 --> 41:04.693
WE HAVE TO REMEMBER SOMETHING--

41:04.693 --> 41:08.767
WE ARE NOW OFFICIALLY
A HOSPITAL RUN BY DOCTORS.

41:08.767 --> 41:10.699
THAT SHOULD MEAN SOMETHING.

41:10.699 --> 41:12.971
IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY

41:12.971 --> 41:15.473
TO BE THE BEST DOCTORS
WE CAN POSSIBLY BE

41:15.473 --> 41:19.508
SO THAT THOSE WHO COME AFTER US
CAN STRIVE TO BE THEIR BEST.

41:19.508 --> 41:21.179
SO...

41:21.179 --> 41:22.951
WITH THAT IN MIND,

41:22.951 --> 41:25.153
I MOVE TO RENAME THE HOSPITAL.

41:25.153 --> 41:26.585
AGAIN?

41:26.585 --> 41:27.786
WHY WOULD WE DO THAT?

41:27.786 --> 41:28.917
TO--TO WHAT?

41:28.917 --> 41:31.219
LET ME GUESS.
THE HARPER AVERY HOSPITAL?

41:31.219 --> 41:32.791
NO.

41:32.791 --> 41:34.623
I PROPOSE THAT WE
GIVE THIS HOSPITAL A NAME

41:34.623 --> 41:37.165
THAT CAN HONOR THE VERY REASON
WE'VE COME TOGETHER

41:37.165 --> 41:38.867
AND BEEN ABLE TO DO THIS,

41:38.867 --> 41:40.529
A NAME THAT EXEMPLIFIES

41:40.529 --> 41:42.531
THE SPIRIT OF THIS HOSPITAL,

41:42.531 --> 41:44.933
BUT ALSO THE DEPTH
OF OUR DEDICATION.

41:44.933 --> 41:49.207
A PATIENT GOES FROM WORRYING
ABOUT GETTING AN ORGAN

41:49.207 --> 41:52.681
TO WORRYING IF THE ORGAN
WILL BE REJECTED.

42:05.093 --> 42:07.856
ALL IN FAVOR?

42:07.856 --> 42:09.828
AYE.

42:09.828 --> 42:12.530
MM-HMM.

42:17.005 --> 42:18.206
AYE.

42:18.206 --> 42:19.908
THE ANXIETY CONTINUES

42:19.908 --> 42:22.941
UNTIL THEY CAN FINALLY OPEN
THEIR EYES AFTER SURGERY

42:22.941 --> 42:24.943
AND SEE THAT THEIR GIFT
HAS BEEN ACCEPTED.
