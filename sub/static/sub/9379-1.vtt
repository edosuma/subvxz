01:23.208 --> 01:24.333
I call it a hit.

01:24.334 --> 01:26.377
- What'll your review say?
- Car, sir?

01:26.378 --> 01:29.213
I like it too,
so I guess I'll pan it.

01:29.214 --> 01:30.381
That's logical.

01:30.382 --> 01:33.843
My publisher resents Cohan impersonating
the president of the United States.

01:33.844 --> 01:36.637
Says our young readers dream
of being president.

01:36.638 --> 01:38.681
"I'd rather be right
than be president."

01:38.682 --> 01:41.601
Cohan may find out
he isn't either one.

01:45.731 --> 01:47.481
I don't see how George does it
at his age.

01:47.482 --> 01:49.775
I remember him
when he was a little boy.

01:49.776 --> 01:52.737
Congratulations, George, old boy.
You did a great job.

01:52.738 --> 01:54.822
- Thanks. Thanks very much.
- Congratulations.

01:54.823 --> 01:58.242
- You had him down to a tee.
- We're still treading on dangerous ground.

01:58.243 --> 02:01.162
Imitating the president,
a lot of people aren't gonna like it.

02:01.163 --> 02:03.623
It's all good, clean fun.
Didn't they enjoy it in Boston?

02:03.624 --> 02:05.958
- Never could do anything wrong in Boston.
- Ha-ha-ha!

02:05.959 --> 02:08.586
Greatest man in the United States
played by the greatest actor.

02:08.586 --> 02:12.131
Nothing wrong with that, especially
when the greatest actor is my husband.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.758
- This could be treason.
- Don't worry.

02:13.759 --> 02:16.052
I know a dollar-a-year man
who'll take care of you.

02:16.053 --> 02:18.429
- A lot would like to shoot actors.
- Save these telegrams.

02:18.430 --> 02:19.930
The government needs paper.

02:19.931 --> 02:22.933
You've got a list like who's who here.
There's everybody but Hirohito.

02:22.934 --> 02:25.144
- We'll bring him in on a shutter.
- Here's mine.

02:25.145 --> 02:28.147
- Won't you read all that cleverness?
- What makes you think I didn't?

02:28.148 --> 02:31.651
I didn't know there was that much love
left in the entire Western Union codebook.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.819
- Hold that. Thank you.
- Uh-oh.

02:33.820 --> 02:37.031
- Don't bother me.
- It's from the White House.

02:37.032 --> 02:38.741
- That bothers me.
- Here.

02:38.742 --> 02:41.452
You read it, Sam. These aren't
my reading glasses. What's it say?

02:41.453 --> 02:43.829
"George M. Cohan,
the Alvin Theater, New York.

02:43.830 --> 02:46.332
The president of the U.S. requests
that you call upon him...

02:46.333 --> 02:49.710
...at your earliest convenience
in regard to a personal matter.

02:49.711 --> 02:53.005
Kindly reply for definite appointment
at White House.

02:53.006 --> 02:55.841
Steven T. Early,
secretary to the president."

02:55.842 --> 02:57.635
Hmm.

02:57.636 --> 02:59.553
There you are, Sam.

02:59.554 --> 03:01.347
There you are. What did I tell you?

03:01.348 --> 03:04.141
Coming at a time like this,
with everything he has on his mind...

03:04.142 --> 03:06.143
...this is not just a
casual invitation.

03:06.144 --> 03:07.436
This is important.

03:07.437 --> 03:09.313
- I think we're in trouble.
- Don't worry.

03:09.314 --> 03:11.774
They don't telegraph you to come
and be shot at sunrise.

03:11.775 --> 03:13.109
He doesn't get up that early.

03:13.110 --> 03:18.364
Besides, I've got a run-of-the-play contract.
Fine time to make lame jokes. Hmm.

03:18.365 --> 03:22.335
I'm worried, Sam. I'm really worried.

03:38.260 --> 03:40.012
Halt!

03:42.806 --> 03:45.516
- Yes, sir. What can I do for you?
- I've got an appointment.

03:45.517 --> 03:48.144
- And the name, please?
- Cohan. George M. Cohan.

03:48.145 --> 03:51.569
All right, sir, if you'll wait
just one moment, I'll call.

03:55.235 --> 03:58.955
Sergeant Lewis
at the Pennsylvania Avenue gate.

03:59.906 --> 04:02.742
- Good evening, Mr. Cohan.
- Good evening.

04:02.743 --> 04:06.042
- We've been expecting you.
- Thank you.

04:08.915 --> 04:12.209
Why, your coat's wet.
Didn't you come in the car?

04:12.210 --> 04:14.044
No, I walked up from the station.

04:14.045 --> 04:17.005
Washington's a great town to walk in.
I always get a kick out of it.

04:17.007 --> 04:20.180
Yes, indeed.
Won't you come with me?

04:22.429 --> 04:25.389
I was supposed to be off-duty
this evening, Mr. Cohan...

04:25.390 --> 04:27.475
...but when I heard you was coming,
I thought...

04:27.476 --> 04:29.435
...I would like to see
if you looked the same.

04:29.436 --> 04:31.395
That depends just
on when you saw me last.

04:31.396 --> 04:34.231
Well, it must have been
30-some years ago.

04:34.232 --> 04:36.942
I was valet for Mr. Teddy Roosevelt.

04:36.943 --> 04:39.278
He got me a seat up in the gallery.

04:39.279 --> 04:41.447
The play was George Washington, Jr.

04:41.448 --> 04:45.785
And you was just singing and dancing
all about the grand old flag.

04:45.786 --> 04:48.996
Mr. Teddy used to sing
it in his bathtub.

04:48.997 --> 04:51.332
- It was a good old song in its day.
- Yes, sir, it was...

04:51.333 --> 04:55.212
...and it's just as good today
as it ever was.

04:59.090 --> 05:01.092
Come in.

05:05.096 --> 05:06.847
Well, hello there.

05:06.848 --> 05:09.558
- How's my double?
- Your double isn't any too sure.

05:09.559 --> 05:10.976
Give me time to work on that one.

05:10.977 --> 05:14.146
Why, I was told you knew
all the answers.

05:14.147 --> 05:17.024
There was a time when I thought so.
Right now, I wish I did.

05:17.025 --> 05:20.569
Yes, so do I. Sit down, Mr. Cohan.

05:20.570 --> 05:22.029
Thanks.

05:22.030 --> 05:24.406
- You know, I'm a little bit nervous.
- Heh-heh-heh.

05:24.407 --> 05:27.159
I'm sorry I missed the opening
of your show.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.536
Maybe just as well.

05:28.537 --> 05:32.498
Don't worry about it.
We understand each other perfectly.

05:32.499 --> 05:35.125
- I think so.
- The Herald Tribune says...

05:35.126 --> 05:38.879
...that you make a better president
and I'd rather be right than I am.

05:38.880 --> 05:40.965
Don't forget,
that's a Republican newspaper.

05:42.342 --> 05:46.846
I can remember you and your family
very well. The Four Cohans.

05:46.847 --> 05:49.265
Do you, really, Mr. President?
That's a long time ago.

05:49.266 --> 05:53.352
Yes. It was while I was
attending school near Boston.

05:53.353 --> 05:54.937
I was a pretty cocky kid those days.

05:54.938 --> 05:57.606
Pretty cocky kid.
A regular Yankee Doodle Dandy.

05:57.607 --> 05:59.775
Always carrying a flag
in a parade or following one.

05:59.776 --> 06:02.862
- I hope you haven't outgrown the habit.
- Not a chance.

06:02.863 --> 06:07.283
That's one thing I always admired
about you Irish-Americans.

06:07.284 --> 06:10.953
You carry your love of country
like a flag, right out in the open.

06:10.954 --> 06:12.329
It's a great quality.

06:12.330 --> 06:15.332
I inherited that,
got that from my father.

06:15.333 --> 06:17.793
He ran away to the Civil War
when he was 13.

06:17.794 --> 06:19.753
Proudest kid in the state
of Massachusetts.

06:19.754 --> 06:23.465
So you've spent your life
telling the other 47 states...

06:23.466 --> 06:25.259
...what a great country it is.

06:25.260 --> 06:27.219
I never thought of it
just that way before...

06:27.220 --> 06:29.054
...but I guess
that's about the size of it.

06:29.055 --> 06:30.890
And I lost no time, either.

06:30.891 --> 06:34.184
It started with a very funny incident,
about 60 years ago.

06:34.185 --> 06:36.729
It was in Providence, Rhode Island,
on the Fourth of July.

06:36.730 --> 06:39.398
There weren't so many stars then,
in the flag or on the stage...

06:39.399 --> 06:41.650
...but folks knew that
more were coming.

06:41.651 --> 06:44.862
They were optimistic,
happy and expectant.

06:44.863 --> 06:47.406
The beginning of the
Horatio Alger Age.

07:01.796 --> 07:04.256
My father was playing in a variety,
breaking in a single.

07:04.257 --> 07:06.091
Nobody was more expectant
than he was...

07:06.092 --> 07:07.760
...unless it was my mother.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.887
She was busy right then
on a smaller production.

07:09.888 --> 07:11.555
Larry O'Leary is me name

07:11.556 --> 07:13.557
By trade I am a dancing master

07:13.558 --> 07:15.684
There's no one can teach the same

07:15.685 --> 07:20.189
Nor teach it any faster

07:20.190 --> 07:23.025
It's easy, very easy

07:23.026 --> 07:25.986
If you watch every twist, every turn

07:25.987 --> 07:29.031
Keep your eyes upon me
And surprised you will be

07:29.032 --> 07:32.368
At the dancing you have yet to learn

07:43.505 --> 07:46.465
Keep your eyes upon me
And surprised you will be

07:46.466 --> 07:48.926
At the dancing you have yet to learn

07:50.762 --> 07:52.304
- Any messages come for me?
- Not yet.

07:52.305 --> 07:54.431
- Better take a bow, Jerry.
- Can't. I gotta leave.

07:54.432 --> 07:56.475
- Watch that water!
- Max, I gotta leave.

07:56.476 --> 07:59.311
- I gotta find out what's happening.
- Oh, for heaven's sake, Jerry.

07:59.312 --> 08:02.106
Take up Number 3.
You're on. Go ahead. Light's up.

08:02.107 --> 08:03.399
- Bye, Sally.
- Good luck.

08:03.400 --> 08:05.484
You can't run through the streets
in that outfit.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.987
- They'll put you in jail.
- Have to catch me first.

08:07.988 --> 08:10.114
Don't forget, Jerry,
you're on again at 4:15.

08:10.115 --> 08:13.033
- Don't worry. I'll be back.
- These things take hours sometimes.

08:13.034 --> 08:15.536
My wife never held up
a show in her life.

08:31.136 --> 08:32.928
Excuse me, can I get through here?

08:32.929 --> 08:35.054
The Irish are at the
head of the parade.

08:35.056 --> 08:38.650
- I'm not in the parade. I want to get through.
- Not a chance, brother.

08:48.153 --> 08:50.487
You don't say so.
We'll get you there in a jiffy!

08:50.488 --> 08:53.241
Here, this'll give
you courage. Charge!

09:05.837 --> 09:07.714
Nellie.

09:08.423 --> 09:09.890
Nellie.

09:18.141 --> 09:19.892
- Is she all right?
- She's doing fine.

09:19.893 --> 09:25.069
- What is it?
- Well, all signs point to its being a boy.

09:31.988 --> 09:34.786
Wait. He just got here
and he's sleeping already.

09:34.991 --> 09:38.791
All babies sleep 20
hours a day, Jerry.

09:39.412 --> 09:41.663
That's why most of them
never amount to anything.

09:41.664 --> 09:43.791
- What'll we call him?
- Oh, I don't know.

09:43.792 --> 09:46.126
- What do you say?
- Well, seeing that he arrived...

09:46.127 --> 09:50.302
...on the Fourth of July,
what about George Washington Cohan?

09:50.632 --> 09:53.300
Well, it has a nice patriotic ring to it.
What do you think?

09:53.301 --> 09:56.386
Oh, the George is fine,
but the Washington...

09:56.387 --> 09:58.685
...may be too long for a billboard.

09:59.224 --> 10:02.318
Well, how about a nice short Irish name?
Dennis or Michael?

10:02.602 --> 10:07.481
George Michael Cohan. Heh.

10:07.482 --> 10:10.405
Yes, I like that name.

10:11.653 --> 10:13.200
Oh, gosh. I forgot.

10:16.950 --> 10:19.999
Hey! It's a boy!

10:22.539 --> 10:24.164
Oh, Jerry.

10:29.587 --> 10:33.216
Heavenly day, Nellie!
He's crying with a brogue.

10:35.593 --> 10:38.428
The first thing I ever had my
fist on was the American flag.

10:38.429 --> 10:42.224
I hitched my wagon to 38
stars and 13 stripes.

10:42.225 --> 10:45.561
I was 6 or 7 years old before I realized
they weren't celebrating my birthday...

10:45.562 --> 10:47.655
...on the Fourth of July.

10:47.814 --> 10:49.398
Then my folks had a real break...

10:49.399 --> 10:51.567
...when my little sister Josie
made her entrance.

10:51.568 --> 10:53.026
She grew to love show business...

10:53.027 --> 10:55.487
...just as she loved everybody
and everything.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.489
We toured the kerosene circuit
in a tank show...

10:57.490 --> 11:00.325
...called Daniel Boone on the Trail.

11:00.326 --> 11:04.496
Everybody doubled in brass.
Dad walloped the bass drum.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.832
For some reason,
they teamed me with a donkey.

11:06.833 --> 11:08.542
I was a good Democrat
even in those days.

11:08.543 --> 11:10.794
Mother and Josie threw out handbills.

11:10.795 --> 11:13.630
Their smiles would've sold tickets
to wooden Indians.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.510
They kept putting new
stars on the flag...

11:18.511 --> 11:21.639
...and the Cohans kept rushing out
to meet them.

11:21.848 --> 11:26.018
We had jokes to match every cornfield.
We sang at every milk station.

11:33.568 --> 11:35.944
Larry O'Leary is me name

11:35.945 --> 11:38.530
By trade, I am a dancing master

11:38.531 --> 11:42.001
There's no one can teach the same

11:42.118 --> 11:44.077
Or teach it

11:44.078 --> 11:47.831
Any faster

11:47.832 --> 11:51.793
It's easy, very easy

11:51.794 --> 11:55.255
If you watch every twist, every turn

11:55.256 --> 11:59.009
Keep your eyes upon me
And surprised you will be

11:59.010 --> 12:02.935
At the dancing you have yet to learn

12:10.230 --> 12:13.982
Keep your eyes upon me
And surprised you will be

12:13.983 --> 12:18.113
At the dancing you have yet to learn

12:37.840 --> 12:39.591
I was taken by surprise

12:39.592 --> 12:41.760
By a pair of roguish eyes

12:41.761 --> 12:45.640
While strolling through
the park one day

12:45.974 --> 12:49.393
We trouped through depression and
inflation, the country's growing pains.

12:49.394 --> 12:51.395
Froze in winter
and roasted in summer.

12:51.396 --> 12:53.272
But it was a good life.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.941
It's a lucky family
that dances together every day.

13:21.718 --> 13:24.386
1891 found our fortunes
flat as a pancake.

13:24.387 --> 13:26.888
Then came a bolt from the blue,
jobs for the whole family...

13:26.889 --> 13:29.099
...in a show called Peck's Bad Boy.

13:29.100 --> 13:32.102
We opened in Brooklyn. Heh-heh-heh.

13:32.103 --> 13:35.698
The town was known for its spirited
audiences even before it had a ball team.

13:39.319 --> 13:42.738
Who keeps hammering
on our opening night?

13:42.739 --> 13:45.115
- What are you doing here?
- I'm the star, ain't I?

13:45.116 --> 13:46.742
You have the leading part, yes.

13:46.743 --> 13:49.244
That means I'm a star,
and there should be a star...

13:49.245 --> 13:51.830
...on my dressing room door.
That's the law of the theater.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.749
Yes, Jerry, give the devil his due.

13:53.750 --> 13:57.627
I know, but I'm nervous. I'll go blank.
I won't be able to remember a line.

13:57.628 --> 13:58.879
Don't worry, Dad.

13:58.880 --> 14:01.631
If you stick, I'll throw you a line.
And you too, mother.

14:27.784 --> 14:31.333
Oh! Thief! Thief! Out! Out!

14:52.433 --> 14:54.726
Why do you do this to me?

14:54.727 --> 14:56.395
It's to jail you're going, me boy!

14:56.396 --> 14:59.231
There, there, there, now.
Henry's not really a bad boy.

14:59.232 --> 15:01.108
He's just mischievous, that's all.

15:01.109 --> 15:04.236
Mr. Schults, I think that should take care
of the damage. Don't you think?

15:04.237 --> 15:06.905
Henry, I want you to promise
the cop and Mr. Schults...

15:06.906 --> 15:09.908
...that from now on
you'll always be a good boy.

15:09.909 --> 15:13.203
I'll promise,
but I can still lick any kid in town!

15:35.768 --> 15:37.936
- Fine work, Georgie.
- I'm proud of you.

15:37.937 --> 15:40.689
- Great, Georgie, great.
- Nice going, kid.

15:40.690 --> 15:43.275
- Real piece of acting there, Georgie.
- You're going places.

15:43.276 --> 15:45.527
- Boy, he sure rolled them in the aisles.
- Thanks.

15:45.528 --> 15:47.446
But what are you all
so surprised about?

15:47.447 --> 15:50.240
You could've told during rehearsals
that I'd be a sensation.

15:50.241 --> 15:53.285
Listen, there's nothing
to this acting business.

15:53.286 --> 15:56.455
I wonder what took me so long
to become a star.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.331
Excuse me. Hey, Vance.

15:58.332 --> 16:00.333
Call a rehearsal for
10:00 tomorrow morning.

16:00.334 --> 16:02.752
Jerry, the time has come
for George's first spanking.

16:02.753 --> 16:04.921
That's right.
I'll hold him while you hit him.

16:04.922 --> 16:07.716
Not me. I don't hit hard enough
to make an impression.

16:07.717 --> 16:10.927
I can't do it. He'd think I'm jealous
because he got more laughs than I did.

16:10.928 --> 16:13.556
Don't think I'm not, either.

16:13.931 --> 16:17.559
Uh, several gentlemen
to see you outside, Mr. Cohan.

16:17.560 --> 16:19.644
Oh.

16:19.645 --> 16:21.855
Gentlemen of the press, I presume?

16:21.856 --> 16:25.701
It's started already.
Will you excuse me?

16:28.738 --> 16:30.785
Let's see how tough he is!

16:34.827 --> 16:37.955
Ow! Ow! Ow!

16:41.667 --> 16:45.128
Ought to be arrested,
every one of those hoodlums.

16:45.129 --> 16:48.215
It seems to me you're taking
all this very calmly, Jerry Cohan.

16:48.216 --> 16:51.384
Your own son almost
murdered in cold blood.

16:51.385 --> 16:54.137
Well, the way I figure, it's a
fine tribute to Georgie's acting.

16:54.138 --> 16:56.848
The way he plays the part,
every kid will want to take a punch...

16:56.849 --> 16:59.100
...at Peck's bad boy
just to see what happens.

16:59.101 --> 17:01.853
What?! Have I got to go
through that every night?

17:01.854 --> 17:05.483
Yes. And matinees Wednesdays
and Saturdays.

17:05.525 --> 17:08.026
Georgie, those boys did
you a great favor...

17:08.027 --> 17:10.444
...and they saved
me a lot of trouble.

17:10.445 --> 17:14.241
You know, most actors give their whole lives
to their profession, not once scoring a hit.

17:14.242 --> 17:16.701
You're lucky.
You're a hit at the age of 13.

17:16.702 --> 17:19.538
I've been in this business a long time
and never met a performer...

17:19.539 --> 17:23.333
...who, in the long run, wouldn't rather
be a great guy than a great actor.

17:23.334 --> 17:25.711
That is, until I made
your acquaintance.

17:26.170 --> 17:27.503
Can't I be both?

17:27.505 --> 17:30.590
Chances are, the way you're going,
you won't be either.

17:30.591 --> 17:33.260
If the hoodlums don't get you,
a committee of actors will.

17:33.261 --> 17:37.013
Actors are considered a very bad
risk by insurance companies.

17:37.014 --> 17:38.974
And any actor with a
conceit like yours...

17:38.975 --> 17:41.935
...well, we just couldn't
afford the premium.

17:41.936 --> 17:44.479
What your father really means
is you're too sensitive.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.606
You're too anxious to make good.

17:46.607 --> 17:48.358
You love the theater too much.

17:48.359 --> 17:51.778
Oh, I know you can improve,
if you want to.

17:51.779 --> 17:53.738
Sure, I can. Just watch me.

17:53.739 --> 17:57.534
From now on I'm Peck's bad boy
only from 8:30 till 11 in the evening.

17:57.535 --> 17:59.953
- That's a boy, Georgie.
- I promise, Mother.

17:59.954 --> 18:03.540
And don't forget Wednesdays
and Saturdays, 2:30 till 5.

18:03.541 --> 18:07.377
Yes, sir! And the other 21 and a half
hours, I pattern myself after dad.

18:07.378 --> 18:09.796
Heh-heh. Well, you could find
a better example...

18:09.797 --> 18:12.516
...but that's the general idea.

18:13.009 --> 18:16.553
Jerry, what do you know.
Ed Albee's coming backstage to see you.

18:16.554 --> 18:19.014
- Albee.
- That's B.F. Keys' partner!

18:19.015 --> 18:21.057
He's big-time vaudeville.
We're in the big time.

18:21.058 --> 18:23.560
He didn't send for us.
He's come here to see us.

18:23.561 --> 18:25.687
Maybe it'd be better
if I spoke business to him.

18:25.688 --> 18:28.440
Georgie, I thought you said
you were going to reform.

18:28.441 --> 18:29.608
I'm sorry.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.818
When he comes in here,
I want you to keep quiet.

18:31.819 --> 18:33.361
Look at the condition of this room.

18:33.362 --> 18:35.739
Josie, get the cheap
makeup off the table.

18:35.740 --> 18:37.616
Hurry up!

18:37.617 --> 18:39.409
Quick, Georgie!

18:39.410 --> 18:42.459
Get the stuff off that shelf there.
That's right.

18:42.622 --> 18:43.955
Hey, Albee'll be right in.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.665
He just stopped at the water cooler.

18:45.666 --> 18:47.834
Jerry, if he offers you a cigar,
don't take it.

18:47.835 --> 18:50.545
I'll take it. That'll impress him
if he thinks I can smoke.

18:50.546 --> 18:52.255
You get behind that curtain.
Hurry up!

18:52.256 --> 18:55.592
I don't want to hear a word out of you.
I don't even want to hear you breathe.

18:55.593 --> 18:58.471
Josie, fix the chairs. The other one.

18:58.679 --> 19:02.183
Here, take this. Oh, Jerry.

19:02.892 --> 19:05.770
- Sit down, Nellie. Sit down.
- All right.

19:12.485 --> 19:13.985
Come in.

19:13.986 --> 19:15.945
Mr. E.F. Albee.

19:15.946 --> 19:17.656
- Hello, Cohan.
- Mr. Albee.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.199
- Meet Mrs. Cohan.
- How do you do?

19:19.200 --> 19:20.825
- How do you do?
- Sit down.

19:20.826 --> 19:22.202
Thank you.

19:22.203 --> 19:25.705
I saw your show tonight. Not bad.

19:25.706 --> 19:27.457
Have a cigar?

19:27.458 --> 19:28.792
Uh, no, thanks.

19:28.793 --> 19:30.794
Your show is no good
for vaudeville...

19:30.795 --> 19:33.046
...but I've seen a lot worse
right here in Brooklyn.

19:33.047 --> 19:34.964
We're opening a new theater
in Philadelphia...

19:34.965 --> 19:36.758
...the Bijou, on the Fourth of July.

19:36.759 --> 19:39.928
If you can fix up a good vaudeville act,
we'll double your present salary...

19:39.929 --> 19:42.806
...give you 10 weeks' guarantee,
and third or fourth billing.

19:42.807 --> 19:45.975
- Double our salary?
- You'll be with the best in the country.

19:45.976 --> 19:49.938
Vesta Victoria, Eddie Foy,
Warren Volk, Charlie Case...

19:49.939 --> 19:51.486
Just a second.

19:52.358 --> 19:53.858
I'm George M. Cohan.

19:53.859 --> 19:56.319
You're opening a theater
in Philadelphia on July 4th?

19:56.320 --> 19:59.197
- Yes, that's right.
- That's my birthday.

19:59.198 --> 20:02.033
Heh. Well, that isn't why
we're opening the theater.

20:02.034 --> 20:04.452
The salary's all right,
but how have you got the nerve...

20:04.453 --> 20:07.672
...to offer us third or fourth billing
after my performance tonight?

20:08.541 --> 20:10.333
Is this kid in your show?

20:10.334 --> 20:11.876
Am I in the show?!

20:11.877 --> 20:13.753
Who do you think was Peck's bad boy?

20:13.754 --> 20:16.673
Oh, I beg your pardon.
I didn't quite recognize you.

20:16.674 --> 20:19.968
You didn't? Then maybe you're not
the showman you're cracked up to be.

20:19.969 --> 20:21.261
George!

20:21.262 --> 20:23.388
Well, now, maybe I'm not.

20:23.389 --> 20:27.143
Maybe you're not quite ready
for the big time yet.

20:27.727 --> 20:31.354
Mrs. Cohan. Mr. Cohan. Good night.

20:31.355 --> 20:33.528
- Good night.
- Uh, Mr. Albee.

20:35.025 --> 20:37.026
- How do you do, Mr. Albee?
- Good evening.

20:37.027 --> 20:38.695
- Call you a carriage?
- If you will.

20:38.696 --> 20:41.119
Carriage for Mr. Albee!

20:41.741 --> 20:44.743
See what happens because you wouldn't
lay a hand on him all these years?

20:44.744 --> 20:47.704
A mother isn't supposed to punish.
She just gives her permission.

20:47.705 --> 20:49.789
Have I your permission?

20:49.790 --> 20:52.625
- You certainly have.
- Ahem.

20:52.626 --> 20:54.627
Don't you ought to get
my permission too, Dad?

20:54.628 --> 20:56.546
Not the hand! He plays the violin.

20:56.547 --> 20:58.256
All right, not on the hand.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.258
Not on the mouth! He has to sing.

21:00.259 --> 21:03.603
All right, not on the mouth.
Come here.

21:04.680 --> 21:06.306
Here's one place without any talent!

21:06.307 --> 21:09.060
Ow! Ow! Ow!

21:13.814 --> 21:16.733
- Who were Lewis and Clark, George?
- Acrobats?

21:16.734 --> 21:18.943
Look at this swell write-up
we got in the clipper.

21:18.944 --> 21:22.030
You'd find us wherever new
states sprouted on the prairie.

21:22.031 --> 21:24.407
We played every town in America
that had a theater.

21:24.408 --> 21:25.867
Any mail for Mr. Cohan?

21:25.868 --> 21:27.619
No. Your father picked up his mail.

21:27.620 --> 21:30.248
I mean, for Mr. George M. Cohan.

21:30.581 --> 21:32.582
The next 10 years rushed
by like a circus train.

21:32.583 --> 21:36.044
Dad seemed content with the sticks,
but I was straining at the leash.

21:36.045 --> 21:37.420
Here's your mail, Mr. Cohan.

21:37.421 --> 21:40.048
Oh, thanks.
A couple of tickets for the show.

21:40.049 --> 21:41.424
We played stock in Buffalo.

21:41.425 --> 21:44.803
Being versatile,
I was playing my mother's father.

21:44.804 --> 21:46.721
Oh, Daddy, he has left me.

21:46.722 --> 21:48.932
All is for the best, my daughter.

21:48.933 --> 21:52.477
In life, we trip,
but right ourselves.

21:52.478 --> 21:55.021
I was correct about man's love.

21:55.022 --> 21:59.025
First, he considers his pleasure
or his honor or his purse.

21:59.026 --> 22:02.737
And only secondly does he think
of the woman he says he loves.

22:02.738 --> 22:05.573
Now I must go life's journey alone...

22:05.574 --> 22:09.494
...and struggle on my weary way
to find peace.

22:09.495 --> 22:12.664
Courage, Emily, courage.

22:12.665 --> 22:15.542
Living has taught your
father many things.

22:15.543 --> 22:19.796
Among them,
to take the bitter with the better.

22:19.797 --> 22:26.135
The road to happiness is paved
with heartaches and stones.

22:48.075 --> 22:51.202
- Good luck, Josie.
- Thanks, Mom.

22:51.203 --> 22:52.704
They're all yours, sweetheart.

22:52.705 --> 22:54.548
Good luck, honey.

23:25.529 --> 23:29.198
Hey, George, there's a young lady,
would like to talk to you.

23:29.199 --> 23:30.666
Show her in.

23:30.951 --> 23:33.124
All right, Miss.

23:33.412 --> 23:36.372
- Mr. Cohan will see you.
- Thank you.

23:36.373 --> 23:38.375
He's all yours.

23:44.089 --> 23:46.841
I'm 18. I sing and I dance,
and I'm going to New York.

23:46.842 --> 23:48.685
Should I?

23:48.886 --> 23:52.931
Oh, Mr. Cohan, you're so old
and so experienced in the theater.

23:52.932 --> 23:55.685
So fatherly.

23:59.980 --> 24:01.689
Do you think it's wise?

24:01.690 --> 24:05.985
I mean, my being 18, singing and dancing,
and going to New York?

24:05.986 --> 24:11.449
Well, ahem, that's very wise.
I mean, being 18 is very wise.

24:11.450 --> 24:12.992
And as for New York...

24:12.993 --> 24:15.954
...The Four Cohans open there
this fall with their new show...

24:15.955 --> 24:18.873
...with a new cyclorama
and 2 carloads of scenery.

24:18.874 --> 24:20.458
Really? When are you leaving here?

24:20.459 --> 24:24.420
- Tomorrow night, right after the show.
- Oh. I can't leave till Wednesday.

24:24.421 --> 24:29.175
- I graduate from high school Tuesday.
- Oh. That's too bad.

24:29.176 --> 24:31.552
Oh, Georgie... Uh, excuse me.

24:31.553 --> 24:33.429
You haven't forgotten
we have a date tonight?

24:33.430 --> 24:35.431
Oh, no, no, no. Of course not.

24:35.432 --> 24:36.933
We're going roller-skating.

24:36.934 --> 24:39.310
Roller-skating on a night like this?

24:39.311 --> 24:40.979
Why, there's a moon out.

24:40.980 --> 24:43.653
I'll be ready in five minutes.

24:46.318 --> 24:47.652
Pipperino, isn't she?

24:47.653 --> 24:51.030
- Yes. Is she your daughter?
- Oh, I'm not married.

24:51.031 --> 24:53.741
- Your niece, perhaps?
- No, she's just a kid with the show.

24:53.742 --> 24:54.909
We've been dating.

24:56.537 --> 24:58.663
Isn't she a little too young for you?

24:58.664 --> 25:02.919
No. She's getting along
in years. She's 17.

25:04.294 --> 25:06.295
Well, shall I sing for you?

25:06.296 --> 25:09.382
I know I have talent,
even if I am from Buffalo.

25:09.383 --> 25:11.342
Well, we haven't got any piano handy.

25:11.343 --> 25:13.561
Well, I'll dance.

25:17.683 --> 25:19.684
Mm-hm. Ahem.

25:19.685 --> 25:21.936
Well, uh, that's rather old,
isn't it?

25:21.937 --> 25:24.981
Everybody's done that. You don't want
to be just an imitator, do you?

25:24.982 --> 25:28.156
Oh, no.
Here's a step I made up myself.

25:31.447 --> 25:32.655
But on the other hand...

25:32.656 --> 25:35.116
...you don't want to be too
original either, do you?

25:35.117 --> 25:36.868
- No.
- Well, I tell you what you do.

25:36.869 --> 25:40.455
You sit right here. You sit right here, and
I will give you an idea of what I mean.

25:40.456 --> 25:43.750
It may not be much. I'm not the dancer
I used to be, but then who is?

25:43.751 --> 25:46.174
Now, watch carefully now.

25:48.547 --> 25:50.006
Oh, no, no!

25:50.007 --> 25:53.181
- Don't you like it?
- Oh, but your heart!

25:55.596 --> 25:58.770
My heart is every bit
as good as it ever was.

25:59.558 --> 26:01.517
Oh, so fast!

26:01.518 --> 26:04.687
Such excitement, at your age.

26:04.688 --> 26:06.022
Sit down and rest.

26:06.023 --> 26:08.107
Maybe I have overdone it a little.

26:08.108 --> 26:11.532
Oh, look at the perspiration
on your brow.

26:11.737 --> 26:14.530
Your wrinkles.
What happened to your wrinkles?

26:14.531 --> 26:18.242
Well, I do have to make up older
than I actually am, you know.

26:18.243 --> 26:20.244
- How old are you?
- Eh...

26:20.245 --> 26:21.871
Not yet 70.

26:22.331 --> 26:24.582
You seem different
from when I first came in.

26:24.583 --> 26:26.084
Even your voice sounds younger.

26:26.085 --> 26:27.710
Well, you see, it's a gift I have.

26:27.711 --> 26:29.670
I'm always as young
as the people I'm with...

26:29.671 --> 26:31.547
...and you've made
me feel very young.

26:32.716 --> 26:35.802
- Very young. Heh-heh-heh.
- I'm glad.

26:35.803 --> 26:37.887
Well, now, let's make plans.

26:37.888 --> 26:39.889
Which manager
should I take you to see first?

26:39.890 --> 26:41.891
Uh, Klaw and Erlanger?

26:41.892 --> 26:45.853
Good old Abe's a very nice fellow,
but maybe a little bit too soon.

26:45.854 --> 26:47.855
Uh, Tony Pastor?

26:47.856 --> 26:49.398
Well, that's better.

26:49.399 --> 26:51.359
Albee, Coster, Beale, and Proctor...

26:51.360 --> 26:53.319
- Oh!
- Huh?

26:53.320 --> 26:55.530
- Ooh!
- Oh!

26:55.531 --> 26:56.781
Wait a minute, little girl.

26:56.782 --> 26:59.450
You're not gonna let a beard
and eyebrows frighten you, are you?

26:59.451 --> 27:01.452
In show business,
you'll see a lot of those.

27:01.453 --> 27:04.122
I'm not sure I want to go
into show business now.

27:04.123 --> 27:05.581
With your talent and ability?

27:05.582 --> 27:08.334
There are very few around
who can sing and dance and act too.

27:08.335 --> 27:11.003
How do you know I can do all those things?
You've never seen me.

27:11.004 --> 27:13.798
I don't have to. I can tell a trouper
a mile away, right on sight.

27:13.799 --> 27:15.883
I feel as though I've
known you for years.

27:15.884 --> 27:17.510
- What's your name?
- Mary.

27:17.511 --> 27:21.097
That's a very pretty name, a very
pretty name. Now, Mary, you calm down.

27:21.098 --> 27:23.766
Let's have a bite to eat, huh?
I always eat after the last show.

27:23.767 --> 27:25.226
- Are you hungry?
- Yes.

27:25.227 --> 27:29.105
I've been here since 2:00 this afternoon,
trying to get up courage to come backstage.

27:29.106 --> 27:31.482
You must be hungry after seven shows.

27:31.483 --> 27:33.610
We'll have a nice cold
bottle and a bird.

27:33.819 --> 27:35.366
What's a cold bottle?

27:36.113 --> 27:39.116
In show business we call that a
piece of pie and a glass of milk.

27:39.825 --> 27:43.202
Aren't you going roller-skating
with that, tlick-tlick, Pipperino?

27:43.203 --> 27:45.204
Nah, I'm tired of picking her up.

27:46.957 --> 27:49.175
- What's the matter, Mary?
- Oh!

27:50.210 --> 27:51.882
Got it.

27:58.468 --> 28:01.470
I was born in Virginia

28:01.471 --> 28:04.265
That's the state that will win ya

28:04.266 --> 28:07.518
If you've got a soul in ya

28:07.519 --> 28:10.521
Ain't no southern frown

28:10.522 --> 28:13.608
In the city of Norfolk

28:13.609 --> 28:16.569
Home of beauties and war talk

28:16.570 --> 28:19.197
- Reckon you'll like it
- If you should strike it

28:19.198 --> 28:23.123
That doggone town

28:46.516 --> 28:49.894
Pretty good. There's a contract
in my desk already made out.

28:49.895 --> 28:52.188
Go and get it. Say.

28:52.189 --> 28:55.566
If any of the Cohans ask you how you like
their act, just tell them it was fair.

28:55.567 --> 28:57.034
I get you.

29:28.892 --> 29:31.269
Reckon you'll like it
If you should strike it

29:31.270 --> 29:34.272
That doggone town

29:52.082 --> 29:54.125
Ladies and gentlemen...

29:54.126 --> 29:56.419
...my mother thanks you...

29:56.420 --> 29:58.754
...my father thanks you...

29:58.755 --> 30:01.098
...my sister thanks you...

30:01.174 --> 30:03.426
...and I thank you.

30:08.849 --> 30:10.266
Nice going.

30:10.267 --> 30:12.810
That's tearing them
out of their chairs.

30:12.811 --> 30:14.437
All set up for you, boys.
Go get them.

30:14.438 --> 30:17.523
Oh, Dad, after the way we went tonight,
we're certainly ready for New York.

30:17.524 --> 30:19.817
If we're a hit here,
it's a cinch in New York.

30:19.818 --> 30:21.485
- Nice going, kid.
- Thanks.

30:21.486 --> 30:24.488
Oh, uh, Mr. Cohan, just a minute.

30:24.489 --> 30:27.158
- Pretty fair act you folks have got.
- They seemed to like it.

30:27.159 --> 30:29.160
That's a soft audience.
Got any open time?

30:29.161 --> 30:31.287
- Yes, from now on.
- I'd like to make you an offer.

30:31.288 --> 30:33.914
- We'd be glad to talk about it.
- Fine. Fine. Heh.

30:33.915 --> 30:37.339
You know, they're always a soft audience
here on Wednesday. Pushover.

30:41.089 --> 30:42.923
- Oh. Mm-hm.
- Did you catch it?

30:42.924 --> 30:44.425
Oh, you were wonderful, George.

30:44.426 --> 30:46.719
- But I don't know. I miss that beard.
- Uh-huh.

30:46.720 --> 30:49.472
- Did you get up on that number?
- Yes. It's a lovely song, George.

30:49.473 --> 30:51.098
- I've learned it by heart.
- Good.

30:51.099 --> 30:53.642
I did it with the orchestra leader,
and you do it this show.

30:53.643 --> 30:56.145
He knows your key,
and you just follow him for tempo.

30:56.146 --> 30:59.565
There's a notice on the call-board. You
can't change your act after the first show.

30:59.566 --> 31:02.526
The manager expects me to sing
"The Wedding of the Lily and the Rose."

31:02.527 --> 31:04.904
Who were they applauding out there,
the manager or me?

31:04.905 --> 31:08.532
- Now, go on out there and do it.
- Oh, George, I can't move.

31:08.533 --> 31:11.202
I can't go out there,
not without rehearsal.

31:11.203 --> 31:12.661
What are you worried about?

31:12.662 --> 31:15.790
You're doing a George M. Cohan
lyric to a George M. Cohan melody.

31:15.957 --> 31:17.500
Yes, but it's my voice.

31:17.501 --> 31:20.880
A George M. Cohan discovery.
Nobody ever had a better start.

31:21.338 --> 31:23.631
There's your introduction. Go on.

31:28.845 --> 31:30.679
Good luck, kid.

31:37.187 --> 31:40.856
When they see it coming
All them babies take a chill

31:40.857 --> 31:44.318
Diamonds glistening all around
And style enough to kill

31:44.319 --> 31:47.947
Her steady fella broke a dice game
Down in Louisville

31:47.948 --> 31:51.826
And buys her chicken every
day for lunch "Come seven"

31:51.827 --> 31:55.496
Dreamy eyes that sparkle
And she rolls them mighty cute

31:55.497 --> 31:58.707
Colored gentlemen say
"That lady certainly is a beaut"

31:58.708 --> 32:00.960
Go broke that she's a hot potato

32:00.961 --> 32:02.878
She's a red-hot radiator

32:02.879 --> 32:06.178
She's the warmest baby in the bunch

32:11.012 --> 32:14.098
Ten consecutive weeks in New York.
That's the big time.

32:14.099 --> 32:16.934
When you leave New York,
Philadelphia, Boston...

32:16.935 --> 32:20.279
- Let me take a look at that.
- Excuse me.

32:20.647 --> 32:22.940
What's going on here?
Take your makeup off.

32:22.941 --> 32:25.192
I'll be back in just a minute.

32:25.193 --> 32:28.279
Colored gentlemen say
"That lady certainly is a beaut"

32:28.280 --> 32:31.407
Go broke that she's a hot potato
She's a red-hot radiator

32:31.408 --> 32:34.618
Hey, Bill. What is this?
What's she singing?

32:34.619 --> 32:36.245
Who told her to switch that number?

32:36.246 --> 32:38.789
She's supposed to sing
"The Wedding of the Lily and the Rose."

32:38.790 --> 32:41.292
- Now, who told her to switch that number?
- I don't know.

32:41.293 --> 32:43.377
You don't know?

32:43.378 --> 32:45.504
Bring down that curtain!

32:45.505 --> 32:48.632
Pull out the houselights
as soon as she finishes the chorus.

32:48.633 --> 32:50.718
Give her a chance.
See how that song goes.

32:50.719 --> 32:52.970
The song is gone.
Pull out the lights.

32:52.971 --> 32:54.930
- No, don't do it.
- Who does she think she is?

32:54.931 --> 32:58.476
Who does she think is running this theater?
What does she mean by changing her number?

32:58.477 --> 33:01.145
The only reason I put her on was
because the dog act got drunk.

33:01.146 --> 33:04.064
- He'll be all right in the morning.
- Oh, she was your idea.

33:04.065 --> 33:07.401
- And a very good idea too.
- Now I know who got the dog act drunk.

33:07.402 --> 33:10.654
Who, me? Why, I've never
been in a saloon in my life.

33:10.655 --> 33:12.490
And style enough to kill

33:12.491 --> 33:16.660
Her steady fella broke a
dice game Down in Louisville

33:16.661 --> 33:19.830
Now look at that. Could you ask
for anything more than that?

33:19.831 --> 33:22.917
Hmm? Just wait. She's wonderful, I think.
Don't you think so?

33:22.918 --> 33:25.294
- Don't do that!
- Ha-ha-ha!

33:25.295 --> 33:28.881
Don't do that! Pull out the lights.
Pull down that curtain.

33:28.882 --> 33:30.633
She...

33:30.634 --> 33:32.384
Get your props together.
You're on next.

33:32.385 --> 33:34.762
Hey, boys, start limbering up.
You follow the jugglers.

33:34.763 --> 33:37.723
You get that curtain up. You can't
ring down on a George M. Cohan song.

33:37.724 --> 33:41.143
A George M....? Oh, I see.

33:41.144 --> 33:43.020
Oh, it's your song. You wrote it.

33:43.021 --> 33:44.813
You can tell that by the applause.

33:44.814 --> 33:46.857
Now, Mary,
go out there and do an encore.

33:46.858 --> 33:49.485
- Do one more chorus, and really do it.
- Oh, no. No, you don't.

33:49.486 --> 33:52.404
Young lady, if you're gonna be
trying out any junk like that...

33:52.405 --> 33:55.950
...do it on a split-fee time, but you'll not
be singing songs like that in my theater.

33:55.951 --> 33:58.285
Now you take a little tip from me:
you start packing.

33:58.286 --> 34:01.705
If you've got any squawks, unload them
on me. I'm the one that started all this.

34:01.706 --> 34:05.709
Listen, squirt, any more interference
on your part and you'll be blacklisted.

34:05.710 --> 34:08.670
You won't even be able to get
into a stage door of any theater...

34:08.672 --> 34:10.839
...and what's more,
as for those songs of yours...

34:10.840 --> 34:12.841
...they won't even be played
on a hurdy-gurdy.

34:12.842 --> 34:15.135
- Are you trying to threaten me?
- Oh!

34:15.136 --> 34:18.013
Mary! Mary! Don't pay
any attention to him now.

34:18.014 --> 34:19.681
Give me the key to
your dressing room.

34:19.683 --> 34:22.351
Drunk or sober,
the dog act goes on in the next show.

34:22.351 --> 34:24.353
And look here...

34:28.024 --> 34:29.400
Bring down the curtain!

34:33.446 --> 34:35.406
Cohan, you're fired.

34:35.407 --> 34:37.449
You're canceled! You're washed up!

34:37.449 --> 34:40.543
You and your whole family!

34:41.746 --> 34:43.914
Oh, things were tough.

34:43.915 --> 34:45.958
Well, at least I was in New York.

34:45.958 --> 34:47.960
I had a trunkful of songs
and play scripts...

34:47.960 --> 34:49.545
...and a heart full of confidence.

34:49.545 --> 34:51.547
I'm glad I had it.

34:52.340 --> 34:55.389
I'm sorry. I can't use this, Cohan.

34:56.219 --> 34:57.845
Youth needs confidence.

34:57.846 --> 35:01.348
I'd learned my job the hard way,
all over the United States.

35:01.349 --> 35:03.767
Guys who had never been past
the corner cigar store...

35:03.768 --> 35:05.811
...were saying my stuff was no good.

35:05.812 --> 35:08.522
A kid had to believe in himself
to buck that.

35:27.834 --> 35:31.211
Who is the man who will spend
Or will even lend?

35:31.212 --> 35:34.506
- Harrigan
- That's me

35:34.507 --> 35:37.760
Who is your friend when you find
That you need a friend?

35:37.761 --> 35:41.055
- Harrigan
- That's me

35:41.056 --> 35:44.808
I'm just as proud of me name, you see
As an emperor, czar, or a king could be

35:44.809 --> 35:48.228
Who is the man helps a man
Every time he can?

35:48.229 --> 35:51.607
- Harrigan
- That's me

35:51.608 --> 35:53.359
- H
- A

35:53.360 --> 35:55.110
Double R-I

35:55.111 --> 35:58.489
G-A-N spells Harrigan

35:58.490 --> 36:01.492
Proud of all the Irish blood
That's in me

36:01.493 --> 36:05.120
And never a man can say
A word against me

36:05.121 --> 36:06.830
- H
- A

36:06.831 --> 36:08.582
Double R-I

36:08.583 --> 36:11.585
G-A-N, you see
Tlick

36:11.586 --> 36:15.255
Is a name that a shame
Never has been connected with

36:15.256 --> 36:18.634
Harrigan
That's me

36:18.635 --> 36:20.302
H-A

36:20.303 --> 36:21.970
Double R-I

36:21.971 --> 36:25.265
G-A-N spells Harrigan

36:25.266 --> 36:28.645
Proud of all the Irish blood
That's in me

36:28.770 --> 36:32.064
Never a man can say
A word against me

36:32.065 --> 36:33.857
H-A

36:33.858 --> 36:35.442
Double R-I

36:35.443 --> 36:38.487
G-A-N, you see

36:38.488 --> 36:42.032
Is a name that a shame
Never has been connected with

36:42.033 --> 36:45.411
Harrigan
That's me

36:45.412 --> 36:48.497
- Well, what do you think?
- I didn't like it. It didn't appeal to me.

36:48.498 --> 36:51.333
What do you mean, you?
I'm the senior partner around here.

36:51.334 --> 36:53.794
- I make the decisions.
- Well, what did you think?

36:53.795 --> 36:55.467
It didn't appeal to me, either.

36:55.630 --> 36:58.132
Which proves, gentlemen,
that you have no ear for music.

36:58.133 --> 37:00.342
He's got no ear for music.
I'm the senior partner.

37:00.343 --> 37:02.561
I have a wonderful ear for music.

37:03.012 --> 37:05.472
But what about the libretto?
It's a grand story, isn't it?

37:05.473 --> 37:07.558
- I laughed all the way through it.
- That's my cue.

37:07.559 --> 37:09.811
If Harold laughs,
then I know it isn't funny.

37:10.603 --> 37:12.896
Have Mr. Cohan sing the
rest of the score for you.

37:12.897 --> 37:15.566
Maybe you didn't like Harrigan
because I haven't got a voice.

37:15.567 --> 37:17.735
Oh, I think you have a lovely voice.

37:17.736 --> 37:20.738
- Don't you think so, Mr. Dietz?
- Yes, you have a very nice voice.

37:20.739 --> 37:22.823
In fact, if you'd like a job
answering our phone...

37:22.824 --> 37:25.492
Are you or are you not going
to produce my play?

37:25.493 --> 37:28.579
If you think I'd put any of my wife's
money into that trash, you're crazy.

37:28.580 --> 37:33.085
That's it, Mary. That's enough.
They've had their chance.

37:33.501 --> 37:35.627
- Have you an appointment?
- Yes. Sam Harris.

37:35.628 --> 37:38.380
I want to see them
about this melodrama I have.

37:38.381 --> 37:40.591
We have no time to
listen to that junk.

37:40.592 --> 37:42.801
You don't know it, boys,
but your days are numbered.

37:42.802 --> 37:44.470
You're making room
for the likes of me.

37:44.471 --> 37:48.350
And someday, Mr. Senior Partner, you're
gonna come to me and admit you were wrong.

37:48.850 --> 37:52.019
In 20 years of show business,
I never once admitted I was wrong.

37:52.020 --> 37:53.270
That's his department.

37:53.271 --> 37:56.064
- And as for your wife's money...
- Excuse me. I have an appointment.

37:56.065 --> 37:58.025
- Who are you?
- My name's Sam Harris.

37:58.026 --> 38:00.444
I have a melodrama
here called Wildflower.

38:00.445 --> 38:02.572
Wildflower.

38:03.031 --> 38:05.657
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

38:05.658 --> 38:08.035
- Horses.
- Oh, and Indians. Uh-oh.

38:08.036 --> 38:10.621
Don't let a couple of Gilberts
like that get under your skin.

38:10.622 --> 38:12.623
There's no sense in crying now.

38:12.624 --> 38:14.458
Buffalo is such a beautiful city.

38:14.459 --> 38:16.168
Is that what you're crying about?

38:16.169 --> 38:18.337
It's a beautiful city,
but I hate to go back to it.

38:18.338 --> 38:20.631
Don't worry. You won't have to.
I'll show them yet.

38:20.632 --> 38:22.800
I'm gonna have my name
up and down Broadway...

38:22.801 --> 38:26.428
until I'm as well known as Hood's Sarsaparilla.
We'll whip them to a standstill.

38:26.429 --> 38:29.097
- Like Grant took Richmond.
- I never really thought of leaving.

38:29.098 --> 38:31.600
We'll make this whole business
sit up and holler for help.

38:31.601 --> 38:35.354
That's what we'll do. They'll all
hear from us, every one of them.

38:35.355 --> 38:37.689
I'm the senior partner.
I'll do the throwing out.

38:37.690 --> 38:39.983
You don't have to throw
me out. I know the way.

38:39.984 --> 38:42.782
That's the last time
I'll ever bring you a play.

38:43.571 --> 38:45.364
That's my department.

38:45.365 --> 38:48.784
Now I will take it to Klaw and Erlanger.
They don't always think of box office.

38:48.785 --> 38:50.494
Thanks.

38:50.495 --> 38:52.996
- Too expensive.
- Didn't even read the second act.

38:52.997 --> 38:55.249
Probably the biggest forest fire
ever put on the stage.

38:56.918 --> 38:59.341
I think he's a little upset.

39:00.046 --> 39:04.642
Five-thirty. We'd have done eight
shows by this time in Buffalo.

39:09.806 --> 39:12.516
The juggler just paid
three weeks' back board.

39:12.517 --> 39:15.018
Put him at the head
so he doesn't have to reach.

39:15.019 --> 39:17.020
Where shall I put the magician?

39:17.021 --> 39:19.731
Until he's paid, he sits at the foot
of the table with the Cohans.

39:19.732 --> 39:21.275
Oh, starvation corner.

39:21.276 --> 39:24.111
And put the goulash at the head of
the table and keep everything...

39:24.112 --> 39:27.030
...but the noodles and the maple syrup
out of the reach of the Cohans.

39:27.031 --> 39:29.741
Noodles and syrup are just enough
to keep them alive.

39:29.742 --> 39:33.620
Anybody who owes me two months'
board bill, I just keep alive.

39:33.621 --> 39:35.706
I don't have to wait on them.

39:40.044 --> 39:42.462
- Good evening, Madame.
- Good evening, Madame.

39:42.463 --> 39:45.007
Oh, no, no, no.

39:45.008 --> 39:47.676
- From now on, this is your seat.
- Oh, thank you.

39:47.677 --> 39:51.680
And you, master magician,
you sit over there with the Cohans.

39:51.681 --> 39:54.474
Heh. Madame, someday I hope
you will give me the pleasure...

39:54.475 --> 39:56.518
...of sawing you in half.

39:56.519 --> 39:58.562
- Ha-ha-ha!
- I just heard today...

39:58.563 --> 40:01.231
...that Hammerstein was bringing over
the Scotch actor...

40:01.232 --> 40:03.525
...Harry Lauter,
at 2500 bucks a week.

40:03.526 --> 40:07.404
Hammerstein's a great showman. A lot
of people have never seen a Scotchman.

40:07.405 --> 40:10.699
- Take some goulash, Mrs. Cohan.
- Thank you.

40:10.700 --> 40:13.577
Did you have that appointment
with that man about your booking?

40:13.578 --> 40:16.246
Oh, yes, he's going to give work
to the act any day now.

40:16.247 --> 40:18.206
What happened
to that Boston offer you got?

40:18.207 --> 40:19.917
That was a mighty sweet proposition.

40:19.918 --> 40:23.211
Four weeks guaranteed at $300 a week
and top billing.

40:23.212 --> 40:25.923
Well, we didn't take it.
See, it just wasn't right.

40:25.924 --> 40:29.009
Any act that lays off as long as
you have, any offer's all right.

40:29.010 --> 40:30.928
Butter?

40:30.929 --> 40:33.513
We just thought we'd
rest a few more weeks.

40:33.514 --> 40:36.224
Yes, you see, my brother's writing
some new material for us...

40:36.225 --> 40:38.727
...and, well, we're just
not ready to open.

40:40.021 --> 40:41.480
You're not fooling anybody.

40:41.481 --> 40:45.400
Everybody knows that you and Nellie and
Josie can get work anytime, anyplace. Heh.

40:45.401 --> 40:46.777
But nobody wants Georgie.

40:46.778 --> 40:50.113
Sure. He's made trouble in every
theater this side of San Francisco.

40:50.114 --> 40:53.867
You can't lay off just because every
manager has blackballed Georgie.

40:53.868 --> 40:56.119
His family hasn't blackballed him.

40:56.120 --> 40:58.830
We may have to take hard knocks
and make a lot of sacrifices...

40:58.831 --> 41:01.249
...but if they want our act,
they'll have to take him too.

41:01.250 --> 41:04.252
We're not breaking up our act
or our family. And besides...

41:04.253 --> 41:07.130
All right, all right, let the
blackballs fall where they may.

41:07.131 --> 41:10.342
Madame Bartholdi,
champagne for everybody!

41:11.719 --> 41:14.012
- If I had it, who would pay for it?
- Dietz and Goff.

41:14.013 --> 41:17.224
- They're producing Little Johnny Jones.
- Oh, George, really?

41:17.225 --> 41:21.478
When Dietz heard the music, he said to heck
with his wife's money, he's gonna use his own.

41:21.479 --> 41:23.647
A second round of champagne on me,
if you had any.

41:23.648 --> 41:26.566
Pass that goulash down
to this end of the table.

41:26.567 --> 41:29.035
Oh, George.

41:29.362 --> 41:31.071
Think of those billboards.

41:31.072 --> 41:35.075
Book, music and lyrics,
all by George M. Cohan.

41:35.076 --> 41:37.661
- Oh, Georgie, I...
- Oh, now, take it easy, Josie.

41:37.662 --> 41:40.497
- There's enough water in the goulash now.
- Heh-heh-heh.

41:40.498 --> 41:43.792
Oh, uh, Dad, I'm gonna be tied up
in rehearsal for the next few months.

41:43.793 --> 41:47.129
Why don't you and mom and Josie take
whatever offers in the meantime to fill in.

41:47.130 --> 41:50.132
Well, I hate to see the act split
up, George, but if you think so.

41:50.133 --> 41:53.176
Oh, sure. You can play all that stuff
around Chicago for Sullivan.

41:53.177 --> 41:54.970
The money's good,
and the jumps are short.

41:54.971 --> 41:58.432
It's a good idea.
You get tired resting too long.

41:58.433 --> 42:01.935
But it won't be the same going back
on the road without you, Georgie.

42:01.936 --> 42:04.896
Why, we'll be like a carriage
with only three wheels.

42:04.897 --> 42:08.525
But you will admit I was a bumpy wheel.
You'll roll along a whole lot easier without me.

42:08.526 --> 42:10.152
- Oh, no, Georgie.
- Oh, but you will.

42:10.153 --> 42:12.320
Is there a part in your play
for a bicycle rider?

42:12.321 --> 42:14.531
I used to be known
as "Venus on wheels."

42:14.532 --> 42:16.241
Mm-hm. I always knew
you weren't a cook.

42:25.918 --> 42:28.754
- How's everything going, George?
- Not so good, kid. Not so good.

42:28.755 --> 42:31.590
I've been pounding the pavement so long,
my socks have bunions.

42:31.591 --> 42:34.468
- Say, Matt, would you put a head on that?
- You bet I will.

42:34.469 --> 42:38.889
The villain says, "I'll tell the girl who you
are unless you help me hold up this train.

42:38.890 --> 42:40.515
Think fast. It's due in 10 minutes."

42:40.516 --> 42:42.809
You'll have the audience standing
with excitement.

42:42.810 --> 42:46.313
I know, I know. The hero helps him,
gets shot in the leg...

42:46.314 --> 42:48.648
...and the girl nurses
him back to health.

42:48.649 --> 42:51.610
No, no, no. He gets shot in the arm,
Mr. Schwab, not the leg.

42:51.611 --> 42:54.738
- You know what happens next?
- I won't be in the theater to find out.

42:54.739 --> 42:57.324
I will be down the street
watching a musical comedy.

42:57.325 --> 43:00.160
Before I put $10,000 into a show...

43:00.161 --> 43:04.122
...it must have songs, dances,
and a lot of girls.

43:04.123 --> 43:08.710
Mmm! Women, women.
Little rose petals.

43:08.711 --> 43:12.130
Now, the big scene is where the hero saves
the girl from a burning forest fire.

43:12.131 --> 43:15.467
It won't be terribly expensive, Mr. Schwab.
I know where I can get a cheap fire.

43:15.468 --> 43:18.887
You don't need much of a fire, just
enough to burn that manuscript.

43:18.888 --> 43:21.556
- Oh, here you are! I've been looking for you.
- What?

43:21.557 --> 43:23.767
We gotta go to Dietz and Goff
and sign those papers.

43:23.768 --> 43:26.103
- Papers? What papers?
- What...? What papers?

43:26.104 --> 43:28.313
You don't want to talk about it
in front of Schwab.

43:28.314 --> 43:30.357
You haven't discussed our musical
with Schwab?

43:30.358 --> 43:32.275
- Music?
- We promised Dietz and Goff.

43:32.276 --> 43:34.027
I haven't said a word
about a musical.

43:34.028 --> 43:36.321
Good. Dietz said it's the
best musical he's ever read.

43:36.322 --> 43:38.073
Even allowed Goff to agree with him.

43:38.074 --> 43:41.284
When I told him about those 20 ponies
and 20 showgirls all coming downstage...

43:41.285 --> 43:43.203
- Ponies and Showgirls?
- Just a minute.

43:43.204 --> 43:45.455
- What are you talking about?
- Waiter, waiter!

43:45.456 --> 43:47.666
- Check for this table.
- No, no, no. That's mine.

43:47.667 --> 43:50.418
Oh, no, no...
Well, we won't argue about it.

43:50.419 --> 43:52.420
- Glad to have met you, Mr. Schwab.
- That's mine.

43:52.421 --> 43:55.340
- Come on, we can't keep Dietz waiting.
- You are a fine guy.

43:55.341 --> 43:56.758
You have girls up your sleeve.

43:56.759 --> 43:59.928
You have ponies and showgirls,
and you don't tell me about it?

43:59.929 --> 44:02.889
- What...? What's it about?
- We gave our word to Dietz.

44:02.890 --> 44:05.267
No time for details.
It's about Todd Sloan in London.

44:05.268 --> 44:07.144
- The famous jockey.
- Yeah. Come on, partner.

44:07.145 --> 44:11.189
Jockey? Jockey sounds swell.
Just my luck to miss out on it.

44:11.190 --> 44:15.615
Mmm. Well, good luck, boys.

44:18.573 --> 44:20.323
Oh, uh, you forgot your manuscript.

44:20.324 --> 44:23.243
Before we sign with Dietz and Goff,
I made some change in the lyric...

44:23.244 --> 44:25.203
- ..of "Yankee Doodle."
- "Yankee Doodle"?

44:25.204 --> 44:27.914
- It was perfect the way it was.
- Oh, you're gonna like this.

44:27.915 --> 44:31.251
- Gives the number added value. Watch...
- May I...? May I listen a little?

44:31.252 --> 44:33.670
- Well, think we should?
- I don't know.

44:33.671 --> 44:36.131
- If you promise to be quiet.
- I promise. I promise.

44:36.132 --> 44:39.217
All right. Come on.
There's a piano in the private room.

44:39.218 --> 44:40.468
"Yankee Doodle."

44:40.469 --> 44:42.437
"Yankee Doodle."

44:42.638 --> 44:44.264
Uh-huh. "Yankee Doodle Candy."

44:44.265 --> 44:45.932
Dandy. "Yankee Doodle Dandy."

44:45.933 --> 44:48.393
"Yankee Doodle Candy."

44:52.106 --> 44:55.400
I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy

44:55.401 --> 44:58.695
Yankee Doodle
Do or die

44:58.696 --> 45:02.240
A real live nephew
Of my Uncle Sam

45:02.241 --> 45:04.993
Born on the Fourth of July

45:04.994 --> 45:09.247
I've got a Yankee Doodle sweetheart

45:09.248 --> 45:12.584
She's my Yankee Doodle joy

45:12.585 --> 45:16.171
Yankee Doodle came to London
Just to ride the ponies

45:16.172 --> 45:20.051
I am that Yankee Doodle boy

45:20.134 --> 45:21.509
I have heard enough.

45:21.510 --> 45:24.930
I will never forgive you for trying
to palm off a forest fire on me...

45:24.931 --> 45:26.848
...when you had that
musical all the time.

45:26.849 --> 45:28.516
Yes, but we gave our word to Dietz.

45:28.517 --> 45:29.935
I can't understand it.

45:29.936 --> 45:33.647
Why is Dietz's wife's money
better than my wife's money?

45:33.648 --> 45:35.525
Why?

45:36.275 --> 45:38.401
Must you give it to Dietz and Goff?

45:38.402 --> 45:41.112
- Must you give it?
- Well, I don't know.

45:41.113 --> 45:42.989
I like Dietz, but I'm not
too fond of Goff.

45:42.990 --> 45:45.408
I'm crazy about Goff,
but I haven't got any use for Dietz.

45:45.409 --> 45:48.745
Gentlemen,
you are in perfect agreement.

45:48.746 --> 45:50.956
I will give you a check
to bind the deal.

45:50.957 --> 45:52.879
Here.

45:53.542 --> 45:57.128
Thank you.
What's your partner's name?

45:57.129 --> 45:58.630
I don't know.

46:00.466 --> 46:02.634
What's my partner's name? Ha-ha-ha!

46:02.635 --> 46:04.844
Well, don't toy with the kid
at a time like this.

46:04.845 --> 46:07.555
Tell him. George M. Cohan.

46:07.556 --> 46:11.268
George M. Cohan. C-O-H-A-N.

46:11.269 --> 46:13.353
And what is my junior partner's name?

46:13.354 --> 46:15.855
Sam H. Harris. Shake.

46:15.856 --> 46:19.359
- Hello. What should I write?
- Uh, Cohan and Harris.

46:19.360 --> 46:20.902
Cohan.

46:20.903 --> 46:24.577
- Mm-hm.
- And Harris.

46:47.430 --> 46:51.266
I'm the kid that's all the candy
I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy

46:51.267 --> 46:52.809
I'm glad I am

46:52.810 --> 46:54.311
So's Uncle Sam

46:54.312 --> 46:57.939
I'm a real-life Yankee Doodle
Made my name on fame and boodle

46:57.940 --> 47:01.067
Just as Mr. Doodle did
By riding on a pony

47:01.068 --> 47:04.988
I love to listen to the Dixie strain
I long to see the girl I left behind me

47:04.989 --> 47:07.741
That ain't a josh
She's a Yankee, by gosh

47:07.742 --> 47:11.036
O say can you see

47:11.037 --> 47:14.789
Anything about a Yankee
That's awful neat

47:14.790 --> 47:18.293
Little Johnny Jones
A jockey from the U.S.A.

47:18.294 --> 47:21.838
Will ride the pony, Yankee Doodle
English derby day

47:21.839 --> 47:25.091
Jones has broken records
Every track at every meet

47:25.092 --> 47:28.636
So Yankee Doodle's gonna be
The boy they have to beat

47:28.637 --> 47:31.890
Sergeant of the British Isles
Who followed his career

47:31.891 --> 47:34.976
Have offered Johnny anything
To keep him over here

47:34.977 --> 47:38.730
But all the money in the Bank of England
Couldn't pay

47:38.731 --> 47:42.400
Enough to keep young Johnny Jones
Away from old Broadway

47:42.401 --> 47:45.820
If you want to take a trip
The surest of sure things

47:45.821 --> 47:49.115
Have your houses mortgaged
Hock your watches, pawn your rings

47:49.116 --> 47:52.410
And put it all on Yankee Doodle
Johnny Jones is up

47:52.411 --> 47:55.872
I'm gonna give America
The English derby cup

47:55.873 --> 47:59.501
He's gonna give
America The English derby cup

47:59.502 --> 48:02.837
I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy

48:02.838 --> 48:06.007
Yankee Doodle
Do or die

48:06.008 --> 48:09.677
A real live nephew
Of my Uncle Sam

48:09.678 --> 48:12.722
Born on the Fourth of July

48:12.723 --> 48:16.434
I've got a Yankee Doodle sweetheart

48:16.435 --> 48:19.896
She's my Yankee Doodle joy

48:19.897 --> 48:23.691
Yankee Doodle came to London
Just to ride the ponies

48:23.692 --> 48:26.903
I am that Yankee Doodle boy

48:26.904 --> 48:30.073
He's a Yankee Doodle Dandy

48:30.074 --> 48:33.410
A Yankee Doodle
Do or die

48:33.411 --> 48:37.038
A real live nephew of his Uncle Sam

48:37.039 --> 48:40.291
Born on the Fourth of July

48:40.292 --> 48:43.878
He's got a Yankee Doodle sweetheart

48:43.879 --> 48:47.340
She's his Yankee Doodle joy

48:47.341 --> 48:50.760
Yankee Doodle came to London
Just to ride the ponies

48:50.761 --> 48:53.935
He is a Yankee Doodle boy

49:21.542 --> 49:24.961
Yankee Doodle came to London
Just to ride the ponies

49:24.962 --> 49:28.339
He is a Yankee Doodle boy

49:55.826 --> 49:59.162
Good luck, Johnny
Success to you

49:59.163 --> 50:02.749
All the best of the best to you

50:02.750 --> 50:05.627
We'll make our bets
And leave the rest to you

50:05.628 --> 50:09.339
Because you've got
What it takes to win

50:15.930 --> 50:19.015
There they are, going to the post
All in good condition

50:19.016 --> 50:21.976
That's Yankee Doodle on the end
A wonderful position

50:21.977 --> 50:25.605
Look at him rear, he's broken line
He's simply wild to run

50:25.606 --> 50:28.525
Now they're back in line again
There's the starting gun

50:28.526 --> 50:30.735
They're off
Come on, Yankee Doodle

50:30.736 --> 50:33.863
We have bet the whole caboodle on you
Run, hurry up, hurry up, hurry up

50:33.864 --> 50:35.323
Yankee takes the lead

50:35.324 --> 50:37.742
Break away there
Show them how to earn their hay there

50:37.743 --> 50:40.662
How to run, hurry up, hurry up, hurry up
Show a little speed

50:40.663 --> 50:44.040
At the quarter, he's gaining
At the turn now, he's reining his horse

50:44.041 --> 50:46.501
Go, go, go, don't hold him back
Let him go

50:46.502 --> 50:49.671
At the half mark, he's cruising
But seems to be losing his lead

50:49.672 --> 50:52.090
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up
You simply have to win

50:52.091 --> 50:54.884
He'll never win, he'll never win
The other nags are closing in

50:54.885 --> 50:57.887
- He's gone to third from second place
- Looks like he's thrown the race

50:57.888 --> 51:00.557
They've got him in a pocket
He can't get in the clear

51:00.558 --> 51:03.393
They're in the stretch, here they come
He's falling to the rear

51:03.394 --> 51:05.061
He's lost the race, but it's a frame

51:05.062 --> 51:08.898
We'll find the blighter who's to blame
And clear the name of Little Johnny Jones

51:08.899 --> 51:10.900
Aw!

51:10.901 --> 51:13.695
Well, that's it, ladies and
gentlemen, it's all over.

51:13.696 --> 51:16.155
Yankee Doodle let them down.

51:16.156 --> 51:18.366
So they'll either pasture
him in clover...

51:18.367 --> 51:21.411
...or have him hauling
rubbish in London Town.

51:21.412 --> 51:23.663
Good-bye, Johnny

51:23.664 --> 51:26.791
We're through with you

51:26.792 --> 51:32.213
We'll have nothing to do with you

51:32.214 --> 51:33.631
You've been dishonest.

51:33.632 --> 51:38.763
And we find that you'll be
suspended for throwing the race.

51:39.680 --> 51:42.390
I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy.

51:44.893 --> 51:48.863
Yankee Doodle, do or die.

51:49.898 --> 51:53.443
Yankee Doodle came to London.

51:53.444 --> 51:56.242
Just to ride the ponies.

51:56.488 --> 52:00.083
I am that Yankee Doodle boy.

52:01.160 --> 52:06.539
For he was that Yankee Doodle

52:06.540 --> 52:10.715
Boy

52:13.756 --> 52:15.840
Women, women. Little rose petals.

52:15.841 --> 52:18.343
Wonderful. You've got them eating
right out of your hand.

52:18.344 --> 52:19.927
- My congratulations.
- Thanks, Sam.

52:19.928 --> 52:22.096
As long as those critics
don't eat off my leg.

52:22.097 --> 52:25.016
Don't worry about the critics.
You got a smash hit. It's in the air.

52:25.017 --> 52:26.893
You can't stop anything
that's in the air.

52:54.421 --> 52:55.922
All aboard

52:55.923 --> 52:58.216
We'll soon be sailing for

52:58.217 --> 53:01.594
The city of old New York

53:01.595 --> 53:04.806
Broadway nights
A million dancing lights

53:04.807 --> 53:08.768
Thrilling sights everywhere you walk

53:08.769 --> 53:12.230
London Town
We're bidding you adieu

53:12.231 --> 53:15.358
Gee, we hate to say good-bye to you

53:15.359 --> 53:16.943
All aboard

53:16.944 --> 53:18.861
Good-bye to London Town

53:18.862 --> 53:23.333
Hello to old Broadway

53:25.619 --> 53:27.662
All right, on the boat.

53:27.663 --> 53:30.164
Now, remember, Jones,
watch for the skyrocket.

53:30.165 --> 53:33.793
If it goes off, you'll know that I've
obtained certain papers from Ansty's cabin...

53:33.794 --> 53:36.504
...that'll prove you innocent
of throwing the English derby.

53:36.505 --> 53:38.464
It'll mean complete vindication.

53:38.465 --> 53:40.717
So stick here on the pier
and watch for the skyrocket.

53:40.718 --> 53:43.220
Thanks, pal. I'll be watching.

53:53.564 --> 53:56.357
Good-bye, Johnny. And don't worry,
we still believe in you.

53:56.358 --> 53:58.067
Thanks, kid. That'll help a lot.

53:58.068 --> 54:00.536
- Good-bye.
- Bye.

54:09.246 --> 54:11.456
Give my regards

54:11.457 --> 54:13.040
To Broadway

54:13.041 --> 54:16.511
Remember me to Herald Square

54:17.421 --> 54:21.799
Tell all the gang
At 42nd Street

54:21.800 --> 54:25.520
That I will soon be there

54:25.763 --> 54:29.307
Whisper of how I am yearning

54:29.308 --> 54:33.853
To mingle with that old-time throng

54:33.854 --> 54:36.230
Give my regards

54:36.231 --> 54:40.902
To old Broadway
And say that I'll be there ere long

54:42.279 --> 54:47.116
We'll give your regards to Broadway

54:47.117 --> 54:51.454
Remember you to Herald Square

54:51.455 --> 54:56.417
We'll tell all the gang
At 42nd Street

54:56.418 --> 55:01.047
That you will soon be there

55:01.048 --> 55:05.593
We'll whisper of how you're yearning

55:05.594 --> 55:09.680
To mingle with the old-time throng

55:09.681 --> 55:12.475
We'll give your regards

55:12.476 --> 55:14.644
To old Broadway

55:14.645 --> 55:20.026
And say that you'll be there ere long

55:37.626 --> 55:42.463
We'll whisper of how you're yearning

55:42.464 --> 55:46.634
To mingle with the old-time throng

55:46.635 --> 55:48.886
We'll give your regards

55:48.887 --> 55:50.805
To old Broadway

55:50.806 --> 55:56.107
And say that you'll be there ere long

56:01.358 --> 56:03.656
Ha-ha!

56:37.394 --> 56:41.355
We'll whisper of how you're yearning

56:41.356 --> 56:45.067
To mingle with the old-time throng

56:45.068 --> 56:48.821
We'll give your regards
To old Broadway

56:48.822 --> 56:53.998
And say that you'll be there ere long

57:04.338 --> 57:06.806
That was your department.

57:08.675 --> 57:11.010
Is it the robin that heralds
the first breath of spring?

57:11.011 --> 57:15.181
How can you think of robins in the spring
when we're freezing to death in Illinois?

57:15.182 --> 57:18.267
Hey, Jerry, did you see the way
they're billing you in Waukegan?

57:18.268 --> 57:21.646
Come here. Look at that.
Funny, isn't it'?

57:21.647 --> 57:23.522
"Jerry, Nellie, and Josie Cohan...

57:23.523 --> 57:26.150
...the family of George M. Cohan,
the new Broadway sensation."

57:26.151 --> 57:28.694
Hey, the kid's doing
all right, isn't he?

57:28.695 --> 57:30.742
Look at that.

57:31.573 --> 57:34.700
Well, that's true.
He is the biggest thing on Broadway.

57:34.701 --> 57:37.620
Yeah, I know, but it ain't right.
We'll build our own reputation.

57:37.621 --> 57:39.914
We'll be billed as we should be:
The Three Cohans.

57:39.915 --> 57:42.333
All right, no need to get excited.

57:42.334 --> 57:44.418
Don't think I'm jealous
of Georgie's success...

57:44.419 --> 57:46.003
...even though I am a better actor.

57:46.004 --> 57:48.714
Of course you're not jealous.
Everybody knows that.

57:48.715 --> 57:50.591
Oh, there'll be no stopping George.

57:50.592 --> 57:53.761
All he needs is a little more experience,
and he'll be a genius.

57:53.762 --> 57:56.931
He mustn't know I'm better. It might
interfere with him becoming a genius.

57:56.932 --> 58:00.643
Still, it does look a little funny:
George being the toast of Broadway...

58:00.644 --> 58:03.104
...and you folks gathering
a few crumbs in the tank towns.

58:03.105 --> 58:06.148
- Is either of you fellas Jerry Cohan?
- I am.

58:15.409 --> 58:17.081
It's from George.

58:18.161 --> 58:21.539
"Impossible to find three
clever actors named Cohan...

58:21.540 --> 58:24.083
...for my new show
anywhere in New York.

58:24.084 --> 58:26.427
Return immediately for rehearsals."

58:26.795 --> 58:29.588
- What'd I tell you?
- The four of us back together again...

58:29.589 --> 58:31.507
...and on Broadway!

58:36.805 --> 58:39.348
Oh, you wonderful girl

58:39.349 --> 58:42.768
What a wonderful girl you are

58:42.769 --> 58:45.730
You made the world appear to me

58:45.731 --> 58:48.774
Near to me, dear to me

58:48.775 --> 58:51.819
Blue skies, gray skies

58:51.820 --> 58:54.739
Main Street or Broadway skies

58:54.740 --> 58:58.034
Under December or May skies

58:58.035 --> 59:00.870
I'll be true to you

59:00.871 --> 59:03.456
Everybody's going
to the barber's ball

59:03.457 --> 59:05.666
There ain't a-gonna
be any sleep at all

59:05.667 --> 59:08.252
Until the stars are gone
Until the break of dawn

59:08.253 --> 59:11.632
We're going to dance
At the barber's ball

59:15.552 --> 59:17.636
Even in the kitchen,
you sound like a tetrazzini.

59:17.637 --> 59:20.473
Heh. In Buffalo, they say
I have a nice little voice.

59:20.474 --> 59:24.695
Yeah. A lot they know in Buffalo.
In Buffalo they thought I was an old man.

59:25.687 --> 59:27.897
Well, how do you like
your part so far?

59:27.898 --> 59:30.107
Oh, I like it.
I like it because it's small.

59:30.108 --> 59:31.984
I'd be afraid to try anything bigger.

59:31.985 --> 59:34.945
You've got something on the leading lady.
You got the best song.

59:34.946 --> 59:37.573
Here it is. It's finished. Come on.

59:37.574 --> 59:39.700
- What about the lyrics?
- Gonna give it to you now.

59:39.701 --> 59:41.874
Sit down and give me a pickup.

59:47.876 --> 59:51.003
My mother's name was Mary.

59:51.004 --> 59:53.882
She was so good and true.

59:54.257 --> 59:57.385
Because her name was Mary...

59:57.886 --> 01:00:00.935
...she called me Mary too.

01:00:02.224 --> 01:00:05.351
She wasn't gay or airy...

01:00:05.352 --> 01:00:08.230
...but plain as she could be.

01:00:08.563 --> 01:00:12.650
I'd hate to meet a Mary...

01:00:12.651 --> 01:00:16.621
...who called herself Marie.

01:00:17.656 --> 01:00:20.329
For it is Mary...

01:00:20.534 --> 01:00:22.701
...Mary...

01:00:22.702 --> 01:00:26.376
...plain as any name can be.

01:00:26.623 --> 01:00:28.791
But with propriety...

01:00:28.792 --> 01:00:31.085
...society...

01:00:31.086 --> 01:00:35.756
...will say, "Hm-hm. Marie."

01:00:35.757 --> 01:00:38.259
But it was Mary...

01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:40.344
...Mary...

01:00:40.345 --> 01:00:44.224
...long before the fashions came.

01:00:44.266 --> 01:00:46.976
And there is something there...

01:00:46.977 --> 01:00:50.813
...that sounds so square...

01:00:50.814 --> 01:00:55.785
...it's a grand old name.

01:00:56.403 --> 01:00:59.613
For it is Mary

01:00:59.614 --> 01:01:01.657
Mary

01:01:01.658 --> 01:01:05.661
Plain as any name can be

01:01:05.662 --> 01:01:08.289
But with propriety

01:01:08.290 --> 01:01:14.211
Society will say, "Marie"

01:01:14.212 --> 01:01:17.298
But it was Mary

01:01:17.299 --> 01:01:19.175
Mary

01:01:19.176 --> 01:01:22.887
Long before the fashions came

01:01:22.888 --> 01:01:26.098
And there is something there

01:01:26.099 --> 01:01:29.685
That sounds so square

01:01:29.686 --> 01:01:36.192
It's a grand old name

01:01:36.193 --> 01:01:38.661
Mm-hm. Yeah.

01:01:39.196 --> 01:01:42.656
Gee, I never cared much for my
name before. It was kind of common.

01:01:42.657 --> 01:01:45.367
Gee, there are millions of
Marys around, but now...

01:01:45.368 --> 01:01:47.453
But I didn't write it
for the millions of Marys.

01:01:47.454 --> 01:01:50.497
I wrote it for one particular,
very special Mary.

01:01:50.498 --> 01:01:53.334
Gee, it's a wonderful feeling having
your name written to music.

01:01:53.335 --> 01:01:56.462
- And not bad music, either, huh?
- Nope, it isn't.

01:01:56.463 --> 01:01:58.672
But how will everybody know
that I'm the Mary?

01:01:58.673 --> 01:02:01.842
I want to make sure that everybody knows
it was written for me.

01:02:01.843 --> 01:02:03.469
They'll know, all right.

01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:07.306
When they look at you singing that song
and then look at me looking at you...

01:02:07.307 --> 01:02:09.725
- ...they'll know.
- Oh, George.

01:02:09.726 --> 01:02:11.393
Take that up an octave.

01:02:11.394 --> 01:02:13.862
- George.
- Better.

01:02:14.397 --> 01:02:17.191
Excuse me for butting in.
I've been looking all over town for you.

01:02:17.192 --> 01:02:19.360
Strange that I should find you here.
Hello, Mary.

01:02:19.361 --> 01:02:22.780
Mr. Harris, George has just written
a new song for me to sing in his show.

01:02:22.781 --> 01:02:25.574
- Think I can do it?
- Of course. You've got a nice little voice.

01:02:25.575 --> 01:02:27.910
That is not a little voice,
and you need an ear trumpet.

01:02:27.911 --> 01:02:31.038
Come on, we've gotta get off to the Lyceum.
We've got to see Fay Templeton.

01:02:31.039 --> 01:02:33.958
- What does she want to see us about?
- She doesn't. We want to see her.

01:02:33.959 --> 01:02:36.543
You need a leading lady.
You've got your ingenue.

01:02:36.544 --> 01:02:39.046
- George.
- Hmm, Fay Templeton. That's not bad.

01:02:39.047 --> 01:02:41.590
She can do four years for us.

01:02:41.591 --> 01:02:43.259
- Think she'll take it?
- I don't know.

01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:46.095
- At least you can get her autograph.
- Or for her to get mine.

01:02:46.096 --> 01:02:48.097
Bring her back to
supper after the show.

01:02:48.098 --> 01:02:50.566
I will if she's still speaking to us.

01:03:03.738 --> 01:03:06.782
Would you like to buy it? Thank you.

01:03:06.783 --> 01:03:09.285
There's one thing in our favor.
Erlanger's on our side.

01:03:09.286 --> 01:03:12.913
- He's got influence with Miss Templeton.
- You talk to him, and I'll tackle Templeton.

01:03:12.914 --> 01:03:14.915
You don't tackle a star
like Miss Templeton.

01:03:14.916 --> 01:03:19.671
- You approach her and very tactfully too.
- Well, if it's tact that does it, it's done.

01:03:21.089 --> 01:03:24.425
If you get me in to see Miss Templeton,
I'll get you two passes to my next show.

01:03:24.426 --> 01:03:27.136
Dan, look. Dietz.
Looks naked without Goff.

01:03:27.137 --> 01:03:29.346
Heh. Yeah. Where's Miss
Templeton's dressing room'?

01:03:29.347 --> 01:03:31.473
- Upstairs.
- I tell you what I'm going to do.

01:03:31.474 --> 01:03:34.143
I'm gonna see to it that Miss
Templeton gets your flowers.

01:03:34.144 --> 01:03:36.772
My respects to Mrs. Dietz.

01:03:37.022 --> 01:03:39.481
Now, that was a very sweet gesture.

01:03:39.482 --> 01:03:42.151
But you've got to remember, Fay,
we're having a tough time...

01:03:42.152 --> 01:03:43.736
...lining up a vehicle for you.

01:03:43.737 --> 01:03:46.113
Now, you should listen to this man.

01:03:46.114 --> 01:03:48.407
- He's just written a big hit.
- One hit.

01:03:48.408 --> 01:03:50.659
He may be a flash in the pan
for all we know.

01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:52.661
And I heard about
Little Johnny Jones.

01:03:52.662 --> 01:03:54.455
And I read the critics... Pfft.

01:03:54.456 --> 01:03:57.124
...Of all the loud,
vulgar flag-waving.

01:03:57.125 --> 01:04:00.627
Well, it was a wow.
I haven't laughed so much in years.

01:04:00.628 --> 01:04:02.212
The fellow's got the golden touch.

01:04:02.213 --> 01:04:04.798
Maybe so, but not
for me, Mr. Erlanger.

01:04:04.799 --> 01:04:07.509
What I want is a quiet,
dignified musical play.

01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:09.845
I want to perform in a theater,
not a boiler factory.

01:04:11.014 --> 01:04:12.639
Come in.

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:15.267
- Hello, Harris. How are you, Cohan?
- Hello, Abe.

01:04:15.268 --> 01:04:17.311
Everything's all right. You'll see.

01:04:17.312 --> 01:04:21.607
Oh, uh, Fay,
uh, may I present Mr. Harris.

01:04:21.608 --> 01:04:24.526
- How do you do?
- And, uh, Fay, this is Mr. Cohan.

01:04:24.527 --> 01:04:26.945
- George M. Cohan.
- How do you do?

01:04:26.946 --> 01:04:30.449
We were just talking about you, George.
Miss Templeton's never seen your work.

01:04:30.450 --> 01:04:32.998
Hmm. Been sick or in Europe?

01:04:35.413 --> 01:04:39.291
No. I've been right here on
this stage for two years.

01:04:39.292 --> 01:04:40.584
Oh, buried.

01:04:40.585 --> 01:04:43.545
Oh, uh, don't misunderstand me,
Miss Templeton. I, uh...

01:04:43.546 --> 01:04:45.756
Well, I've never been
at a loss for words before...

01:04:45.757 --> 01:04:49.760
...but right now standing here
in your presence, why, I hardly...

01:04:49.761 --> 01:04:52.679
Well, I'd prefer to have
these flowers speak for me.

01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:56.058
- Why, Mr. Cohan, how sweet of you.
- Oh, it was nothing at all.

01:04:56.059 --> 01:04:58.685
Excuse me for breaking in on you
like this, Miss Templeton...

01:04:58.686 --> 01:05:01.897
...but I would like to present
my own flowers my own way.

01:05:01.898 --> 01:05:05.025
- But, Mr. Cohan, I thought... Is he?
- Drunk.

01:05:05.026 --> 01:05:08.987
May I have the honor of supping with
you at Rex's tonight after the show...

01:05:08.988 --> 01:05:10.989
...and drinking champagne
out of your...

01:05:10.990 --> 01:05:13.117
- Pardon me.... slipper?
- Excuse me, Mr. Dietz.

01:05:13.118 --> 01:05:16.412
Haven't you forgotten that your junior
partner, Goff, does all the drinking?

01:05:16.413 --> 01:05:19.373
Yes, but on special occasions,
I take over...

01:05:19.374 --> 01:05:21.291
May I put these in water for you?

01:05:21.292 --> 01:05:24.336
- Well, really, I...
- I never saw Dietz drunk before.

01:05:24.337 --> 01:05:26.880
Heh-heh. Well, uh, shall we
get down to business?

01:05:26.881 --> 01:05:28.173
If you like, Abe.

01:05:28.174 --> 01:05:30.300
Well, George,
how would you like to do a play...

01:05:30.301 --> 01:05:32.177
...with one of the biggest stars
in America?

01:05:32.178 --> 01:05:34.304
- What do you think I've been doing?
- Heh. Yes.

01:05:34.305 --> 01:05:37.391
You see what I mean, Fay?
Heh-heh. Isn't he a card?

01:05:37.392 --> 01:05:39.101
Positively a riot.

01:05:39.102 --> 01:05:42.438
Yes, well, George,
what's your new story like?

01:05:42.439 --> 01:05:45.607
That is, I mean,
can you write a play without a flag?

01:05:45.608 --> 01:05:48.652
Miss Templeton, I can write a play
without anything except a pencil.

01:05:48.653 --> 01:05:52.239
- Laugh. Now, look...
- There's really no use discussing anything.

01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:56.285
I would never please the sort of people
who revel in your antics and fireworks.

01:05:56.286 --> 01:05:58.203
Oh, you're just being modest,
Miss Templeton.

01:05:58.204 --> 01:06:01.623
If you'd let yourself go, you'd be just as
noisy and entertaining as the rest of us.

01:06:01.624 --> 01:06:03.250
You might even have fun yourself.

01:06:03.251 --> 01:06:05.711
Abe, isn't it about time
for the curtain to go up?

01:06:05.712 --> 01:06:08.630
Look, if you haven't got time now,
maybe a few minutes after the show.

01:06:08.631 --> 01:06:11.383
I'm sorry. After the show
I'm going home to New Rochelle.

01:06:11.384 --> 01:06:13.093
It's only 45 minutes from here...

01:06:13.094 --> 01:06:16.096
...but it's like a thousand miles
from all the noisy, neurotic people...

01:06:16.097 --> 01:06:18.223
...one has to associate with
in our profession.

01:06:18.224 --> 01:06:20.100
Now, Miss Templeton, you can't...

01:06:20.101 --> 01:06:23.937
- Fay, I warned you.
- That tact of yours. That wonderful tact.

01:06:28.359 --> 01:06:30.577
What are you thinking about?

01:06:42.957 --> 01:06:44.750
Well, have you thought it over, Fay?

01:06:44.751 --> 01:06:46.710
I'm not interested in Mr. Cohan
or his plays.

01:06:46.711 --> 01:06:48.587
Now you're making a
great mistake, Fay.

01:06:48.588 --> 01:06:51.798
He's the most original thing that
ever hit Broadway. You know why?

01:06:51.799 --> 01:06:55.177
Because he's the whole darn country
squeezed into one pair of pants.

01:06:55.178 --> 01:06:58.263
His writing, his song, why,
even his walk and his talk...

01:06:58.264 --> 01:07:00.933
...they all touch something
way down here in people.

01:07:00.934 --> 01:07:04.228
Now, don't ask me why it is, but it
happens every time the curtain goes up.

01:07:04.229 --> 01:07:05.687
It's pure magic.

01:07:05.688 --> 01:07:08.273
I'm bored by magic.
I know his formula.

01:07:08.274 --> 01:07:11.360
A fresh, young sprout gets rich
between 8:30 and 11 p.m.

01:07:11.361 --> 01:07:13.195
Yes, that's just it, Fay.

01:07:13.196 --> 01:07:15.739
George M. Cohan has invented
the success story.

01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:19.576
And every American loves it because
it happens to be his own private dream.

01:07:19.577 --> 01:07:22.162
He's found the mainspring
in the antique clock.

01:07:22.163 --> 01:07:24.331
Ambition, pride, patriotism.

01:07:24.332 --> 01:07:26.708
That's why they call him
the Yankee Doodle boy.

01:07:26.709 --> 01:07:29.795
Now, if you'll take a tip from me, Fay,
you'll do just what I'm doing.

01:07:29.796 --> 01:07:32.506
You'll hitch your wagon
to his star right now.

01:07:32.507 --> 01:07:35.635
Abe, I've got to change
for the second act.

01:07:36.719 --> 01:07:38.762
Now, Fay, don't make up
your mind too quickly.

01:07:38.763 --> 01:07:40.472
Take a little time. Think it over.

01:07:40.473 --> 01:07:41.807
Who's locked my door?

01:07:43.351 --> 01:07:45.894
- Who is it?
- What's going on here?

01:07:45.895 --> 01:07:48.063
He'll be through in a minute.

01:07:48.064 --> 01:07:51.441
Excuse me. I beg your pardon.
I didn't realize who you were. Come in.

01:07:51.442 --> 01:07:53.235
- May I?
- Why, of course.

01:07:53.236 --> 01:07:54.903
What does this mean?

01:07:54.904 --> 01:07:56.989
Would you mind telling me
why you're still here?

01:07:56.990 --> 01:07:58.907
Well, here it is,
ready and dedicated to you.

01:07:58.908 --> 01:08:01.118
- What?
- Well, uh, when you made that exit speech...

01:08:01.119 --> 01:08:02.953
...you said you lived
only 45 minutes away.

01:08:02.954 --> 01:08:05.789
That struck me as being a perfect
title for a show and for a song.

01:08:05.790 --> 01:08:08.333
During the first act,
you've written this new song?

01:08:08.334 --> 01:08:10.085
Strange surrounding.
It took me longer.

01:08:10.086 --> 01:08:12.379
He's worked so hard.
The least you could do is hear it.

01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:15.924
- Yeah, it'll only take a minute, won't it?
- Depends on the encores. Heh.

01:08:15.925 --> 01:08:19.304
Well, you certainly are persistent.
All right, go ahead.

01:08:19.761 --> 01:08:21.555
- Mind if I change?
- Oh, thank you.

01:08:21.555 --> 01:08:25.229
That's wonderful of you. Thank you very,
very much. Go ahead, George. Play it.

01:08:29.147 --> 01:08:33.108
Only 45 minutes from Broadway

01:08:33.109 --> 01:08:36.111
Think of the changes it brings

01:08:36.112 --> 01:08:39.488
For the short time it takes
What a difference it makes

01:08:39.490 --> 01:08:43.035
In the ways of the people and things

01:08:43.036 --> 01:08:46.412
Oh, what a fine bunch of Reubens

01:08:46.413 --> 01:08:49.416
Oh, what a jay atmosphere

01:08:49.417 --> 01:08:52.669
They have whiskers like hay
And imagine Broadway

01:08:52.670 --> 01:08:55.719
Only 45 minutes from here

01:08:56.049 --> 01:08:58.300
Only 45 minutes

01:08:58.301 --> 01:09:01.511
That's good. It's rather different.

01:09:01.511 --> 01:09:03.263
- You liked it, Miss Templeton?
- Ah!

01:09:03.264 --> 01:09:05.765
Excuse me.
That's only a chorus number.

01:09:05.767 --> 01:09:08.185
He's got one number called "Mary"
that's perfect for you.

01:09:08.185 --> 01:09:10.145
- She doesn't sing that.
- She is gonna sing it.

01:09:10.145 --> 01:09:11.520
- No, no, no.
- Shut up.

01:09:11.522 --> 01:09:13.615
It's the best thing he's ever done.

01:09:14.817 --> 01:09:17.069
"Mary," hmm?

01:09:17.069 --> 01:09:18.654
This looks very interesting.

01:09:18.654 --> 01:09:20.697
It's only a so-so number.

01:09:20.698 --> 01:09:22.823
If it's as good as "45 Minutes
from Broadway"...

01:09:22.825 --> 01:09:26.161
- Well, it isn't, and besides, you...
- What do you want to do, spoil everything?

01:09:26.162 --> 01:09:28.872
- I can't let her have that.
- What difference does it make?

01:09:28.872 --> 01:09:31.166
- She's gonna sing it. She will.
- But she can't sing it.

01:09:31.167 --> 01:09:33.919
With Abe's money and your brains,
we'll be able to make a million.

01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:35.629
Shh!

01:09:54.357 --> 01:09:57.651
For it is Mary

01:09:57.652 --> 01:09:59.861
Mary

01:10:07.245 --> 01:10:11.456
Society will say

01:10:11.457 --> 01:10:14.167
"Marie"

01:10:14.168 --> 01:10:17.254
But it was Mary

01:10:17.255 --> 01:10:19.840
Mary

01:10:19.841 --> 01:10:24.437
Long before the fashions came

01:10:26.681 --> 01:10:28.649
Come in.

01:10:29.225 --> 01:10:31.601
Oh! A little early for
Christmas, isn't it?

01:10:31.602 --> 01:10:35.230
Well, I was just passing the flowers,
and they threw in the candy.

01:10:35.231 --> 01:10:37.357
George, I'm sure our
song will live forever.

01:10:37.358 --> 01:10:41.111
I've been playing it ever since you left,
and the neighbors haven't complained once.

01:10:41.112 --> 01:10:42.821
What happened with Fay Templeton?

01:10:42.822 --> 01:10:45.782
Oh, she's dying to play the part.
But I haven't made up my mind yet.

01:10:45.783 --> 01:10:47.325
Mmm. Ham or bacon?

01:10:47.326 --> 01:10:49.745
- Bacon.
- Good. Ham makes me self-conscious.

01:10:49.746 --> 01:10:52.205
You're hesitating about having
Fay Templeton in your show?

01:10:52.206 --> 01:10:55.542
You know how those big stars are.
Temperamental and hard to get along with.

01:10:55.543 --> 01:10:57.294
Asking impossible terms
and conditions.

01:10:57.295 --> 01:10:59.713
- I'll take my coffee black.
- You ought to give in to her.

01:10:59.714 --> 01:11:02.674
But, darling,
no matter what she asks?

01:11:02.675 --> 01:11:06.470
- No matter what she asks.
- Why are you so concerned for Templeton?

01:11:06.471 --> 01:11:09.556
Oh, I don't care for Templeton.
I'm looking out for you.

01:11:09.557 --> 01:11:13.477
Think what it means for you to have
a star like Templeton in your show.

01:11:13.478 --> 01:11:17.403
Mm-hm. Always worried about me,
aren't you? Ever think about yourself?

01:11:18.107 --> 01:11:20.609
Not much lately. Haven't had time.

01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:22.444
The minute I saw you
without your beard...

01:11:22.445 --> 01:11:24.946
...I knew here was a little boy
who needed looking after...

01:11:24.947 --> 01:11:27.949
- ...so I gave myself the job.
- Mm-hm.

01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:31.745
There are a lot of singers, you know,
but very few really good looker-afters.

01:11:31.746 --> 01:11:33.705
Mm-hm.

01:11:33.706 --> 01:11:37.876
Darling, how would you like
a lifetime job of looking after?

01:11:37.877 --> 01:11:39.961
Leading lady, run of the play...

01:11:39.962 --> 01:11:42.255
...maybe a few heartaches
after the curtain goes up...

01:11:42.256 --> 01:11:44.591
...but I can guarantee
you some laughs.

01:11:44.592 --> 01:11:46.765
How does it sound?

01:11:46.928 --> 01:11:49.471
I think I might like it, Mr. Cohan.

01:11:49.472 --> 01:11:52.224
Could I, uh, see some of the script?

01:11:52.225 --> 01:11:54.193
Mm-hm.

01:11:56.646 --> 01:11:58.438
Hmm.

01:11:58.439 --> 01:12:01.112
Not bad for a first reading.

01:12:03.402 --> 01:12:05.449
The coffee's boiling over.

01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:08.323
Darling, there's something
I forgot to tell you.

01:12:08.324 --> 01:12:11.952
- Yes, dear?
- Uh, I gave your song to Templeton tonight.

01:12:11.953 --> 01:12:13.420
Mm-hm.

01:12:14.121 --> 01:12:17.916
Darling, did you hear me? I, uh...

01:12:17.917 --> 01:12:20.293
I gave your song
to Fay Templeton tonight.

01:12:20.294 --> 01:12:25.595
Yes, I know. I knew you did, dear,
when you brought the candy and flowers.

01:12:51.617 --> 01:12:55.620
My mother's name was Mary

01:12:55.621 --> 01:12:59.583
She was so good and true

01:12:59.584 --> 01:13:03.503
Because her name was Mary

01:13:03.504 --> 01:13:08.508
She calls me Mary too

01:13:08.509 --> 01:13:12.512
She wasn't gay or airy

01:13:12.513 --> 01:13:17.350
But plain as she could be

01:13:17.351 --> 01:13:21.771
I'd hate to meet a Mary

01:13:21.772 --> 01:13:28.320
Who calls herself Marie

01:13:28.321 --> 01:13:31.907
For it was Mary

01:13:31.908 --> 01:13:34.242
Mary

01:13:34.243 --> 01:13:38.038
Plain as any name can be

01:13:38.039 --> 01:13:40.707
But with propriety

01:13:40.708 --> 01:13:47.088
Society will say, "Marie"

01:13:47.089 --> 01:13:50.091
For it was Mary

01:13:50.092 --> 01:13:52.302
Mary

01:13:52.303 --> 01:13:56.222
Long before the fashions came

01:13:56.223 --> 01:13:59.935
And there is something there

01:13:59.936 --> 01:14:03.730
That sounds so square

01:14:03.731 --> 01:14:07.692
It's a wonderful song, George, best
you've ever done. It'll live for years.

01:14:07.693 --> 01:14:11.321
Thanks, Sam. But I still think
Mary should have sung it.

01:14:11.322 --> 01:14:16.498
Oh, that's all right. Fay has
the song, but I have the author.

01:14:18.913 --> 01:14:22.666
And there is something there

01:14:22.667 --> 01:14:27.587
That sounds so square

01:14:27.588 --> 01:14:29.923
It's a grand

01:14:29.924 --> 01:14:32.300
Old

01:14:32.301 --> 01:14:35.595
Name

01:14:37.348 --> 01:14:42.143
Only 45 minutes from Broadway

01:14:42.144 --> 01:14:45.773
Think of the changes it brings

01:14:45.982 --> 01:14:51.319
For the short time it takes
What a difference it makes

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:55.323
In the ways of the people and things

01:14:55.324 --> 01:14:58.159
Oh, and things

01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:02.122
Oh, what a fine bunch of Reubens

01:15:02.123 --> 01:15:05.917
Oh, what a jay atmosphere

01:15:05.918 --> 01:15:07.961
They have whiskers like hay

01:15:07.962 --> 01:15:14.265
And imagine Broadway
Only 45 minutes from here

01:15:31.027 --> 01:15:35.030
It's awfully nice of all you boys
To see me to the train

01:15:35.031 --> 01:15:38.742
So long, Mary

01:15:38.743 --> 01:15:42.328
I didn't think you'd care
If you should never see me again

01:15:42.329 --> 01:15:45.749
You're wrong, Mary

01:15:45.750 --> 01:15:49.669
This reminds me of my family

01:15:49.670 --> 01:15:53.339
On the day I left Schenectady

01:15:53.340 --> 01:15:57.010
To the depot
Then they came with me

01:15:57.011 --> 01:16:03.141
I seem to hear them say

01:16:05.102 --> 01:16:09.397
"So long, Mary"

01:16:09.398 --> 01:16:13.359
Mary, we will miss you so

01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:17.155
"So long, Mary"

01:16:17.156 --> 01:16:20.575
How we hate to see you go

01:16:20.576 --> 01:16:24.704
"And we'll all be
longing for you, Mary

01:16:24.705 --> 01:16:28.291
While you roam"

01:16:28.292 --> 01:16:32.045
So long, Mary

01:16:32.046 --> 01:16:35.799
Don't forget to come back home

01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:39.302
So long, Mary

01:16:42.890 --> 01:16:46.351
Oh, oh, oh, oh

01:16:46.352 --> 01:16:49.729
How we hate to see you go

01:16:57.196 --> 01:17:00.740
So long, Mary

01:17:00.741 --> 01:17:04.035
Don't forget to come back home

01:17:04.036 --> 01:17:06.412
And we'll all be
longing for you, Mary

01:17:07.915 --> 01:17:11.084
While you're gone

01:17:11.085 --> 01:17:15.547
So long, Mary

01:17:15.548 --> 01:17:17.971
Don't forget

01:17:18.092 --> 01:17:21.928
To come back

01:17:21.929 --> 01:17:25.557
Home

01:17:32.523 --> 01:17:35.483
Look at Cohan. He's got them
lined up at the box office.

01:17:35.484 --> 01:17:38.695
I've never seen the guy. Got his
name all over the place. Look at that.

01:17:38.696 --> 01:17:41.573
"Cohan and Harris present
George Washington, Jr.

01:17:41.574 --> 01:17:44.951
Starring the author and composer,
George M. Cohan."

01:17:44.952 --> 01:17:47.537
I wonder what the M is for.
Oh, modesty.

01:17:47.538 --> 01:17:49.247
- Hello, Mr. Foy.
- How are you?

01:17:49.248 --> 01:17:50.999
- Enjoyed your show last night.
- Thank you.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.293
You always appear
in the kind of stuff I like.

01:17:53.294 --> 01:17:55.170
Thank you. That's very nice of you.

01:17:55.171 --> 01:17:57.380
"George M. Cohan
and his royal family.

01:17:57.381 --> 01:18:00.967
Books and lyrics, music, and direction
by George M. Cohan.

01:18:00.968 --> 01:18:02.802
Printed by Sam Divensky."

01:18:02.803 --> 01:18:04.929
That must be Cohan's alias.

01:18:04.930 --> 01:18:07.640
Certainly keeps himself in billing,
this George M. Cohan.

01:18:07.641 --> 01:18:10.101
Don't memorize that one.
There's plenty all over town.

01:18:10.102 --> 01:18:14.814
I'd like to forget it. Say, listen,
you connected with this turkey?

01:18:14.815 --> 01:18:16.858
Turkey? I hear it's pretty good.

01:18:16.859 --> 01:18:18.943
It's a malicious rumor
to gyp the public.

01:18:18.944 --> 01:18:21.654
Who is this guy Cohan? Where is he from?
What is he, an upstart?

01:18:21.655 --> 01:18:25.491
Oh, he's been through the mill. Small-time
and big-time vaudeville, rep shows.

01:18:25.492 --> 01:18:28.411
- Even followed dog acts.
- Must have looked like an encore.

01:18:28.412 --> 01:18:31.915
- Say, uh, is he as good as Foy?
- Who?

01:18:31.916 --> 01:18:33.791
Foy, Foy, Eddie Foy.

01:18:33.792 --> 01:18:35.585
Oh, pardon me.

01:18:35.586 --> 01:18:38.755
Pardon me, I didn't quite catch the name.
Would you mind spraying it again?

01:18:38.756 --> 01:18:40.673
Eddie Foy.

01:18:40.674 --> 01:18:43.593
The star that's got the big show
down the street with a chorus of 70.

01:18:43.594 --> 01:18:46.429
Why, I thought they looked
a little younger than that.

01:18:46.430 --> 01:18:49.140
I hear now that Cohan's in town,
Foy's gonna retire.

01:18:49.141 --> 01:18:50.934
Foy won't retire till he's 90.

01:18:50.935 --> 01:18:53.519
Is it gonna take him that long
to discover he has no talent?

01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:56.356
They tell me when he tries to sing,
the orchestra puts up umbrellas.

01:18:56.357 --> 01:19:00.485
Tries to sing? Why, he's a genius.
He keeps his audience glued to the seats.

01:19:00.486 --> 01:19:03.947
That's one way of keeping them in the
theater. Cohan does it with talent. Look.

01:19:03.948 --> 01:19:07.492
Produces his own plays, writes his own
books, lyrics and music, plays the leads...

01:19:07.493 --> 01:19:10.286
- ...and is a great dancer.
- He dances, eh?

01:19:10.287 --> 01:19:11.829
When does he get time to practice?

01:19:11.830 --> 01:19:15.041
When you write your own plays,
you don't have to. Cohan's done all right.

01:19:15.042 --> 01:19:19.137
He's given the world "Yankee Doodle
Dandy." What's Foy done for his country?

01:19:19.380 --> 01:19:21.047
He gave them seven kids.

01:19:21.048 --> 01:19:22.715
- Does he dance?
- One of the best.

01:19:22.716 --> 01:19:25.310
When does he get time to practice?

01:19:25.386 --> 01:19:28.346
Say, listen, young fella,
my name's Eddie Foy.

01:19:28.347 --> 01:19:30.723
I know it. I'm George M. Cohan.

01:19:30.724 --> 01:19:33.434
Oh, so you're Cohan?

01:19:33.435 --> 01:19:35.770
Well, if I said anything accidental
to make you mad...

01:19:35.771 --> 01:19:37.522
...I want you to know
I'm darn glad I did.

01:19:37.523 --> 01:19:41.109
I don't blame you. I'd feel the same way
if I were up against Cohan.

01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:43.278
- What do like to drink?
- Oh, moxie.

01:19:43.279 --> 01:19:46.447
I can supply it. The attraction inside
is a whole lot bigger than I am.

01:19:46.448 --> 01:19:48.950
Come and see when your show closes.

01:20:26.238 --> 01:20:29.907
There's a feeling comes a-stealing
And it sets my brain a-reeling

01:20:29.908 --> 01:20:33.619
When I listen to the music
Of a military band

01:20:33.620 --> 01:20:37.290
Every tune like "Yankee Doodle"
Simply sets me off my noodle

01:20:37.291 --> 01:20:41.461
It's that patriotic something
That no one can understand

01:20:41.462 --> 01:20:43.421
Way down south in the land of cotton

01:20:43.422 --> 01:20:46.132
Melody untiring

01:20:46.133 --> 01:20:48.384
It's so inspiring

01:20:48.385 --> 01:20:52.138
Hurrah, hurrah
We joined the jubilee

01:20:52.139 --> 01:20:55.933
And that's going some
For the Yankees, by gum

01:20:55.934 --> 01:20:59.562
Red, white and blue I am for you

01:20:59.563 --> 01:21:02.857
Honest, you're a grand old flag

01:21:02.858 --> 01:21:06.652
You're a grand old flag
You're a high-flying flag

01:21:06.653 --> 01:21:10.198
And forever in peace may you wave

01:21:10.199 --> 01:21:12.492
You're the emblem of

01:21:12.493 --> 01:21:14.285
The land I love

01:21:14.286 --> 01:21:17.497
The home of the free and the brave

01:21:17.498 --> 01:21:21.292
Every heart beats true
Under red, white and blue

01:21:21.293 --> 01:21:24.837
Where there's never a boast or brag

01:21:24.838 --> 01:21:28.591
But should old acquaintance be forgot

01:21:28.592 --> 01:21:31.469
Keep your eye on that grand old flag

01:21:31.470 --> 01:21:36.146
Rally round the flag
Let us rally round the flag

01:21:37.518 --> 01:21:40.812
We took the red
from the flame of dawn...

01:21:40.813 --> 01:21:42.730
...the dawn of a new nation.

01:21:42.731 --> 01:21:46.984
And the white was the white
of the snow at Valley Forge.

01:21:46.985 --> 01:21:51.155
The blue was the blue
of the free, open sky...

01:21:51.156 --> 01:21:55.118
...and the stars were
the 13 sisters by the sea...

01:21:55.119 --> 01:21:59.038
...who built their home
and called it liberty.

01:21:59.039 --> 01:22:00.957
To symbolize the spirit

01:22:00.958 --> 01:22:02.125
Right!

01:22:02.126 --> 01:22:03.668
The spirit of freedom

01:22:03.669 --> 01:22:05.044
Right again!

01:22:05.045 --> 01:22:07.922
The spirit that gave
birth to American

01:22:07.923 --> 01:22:09.340
Democracy

01:22:09.341 --> 01:22:11.764
That's the spirit!

01:22:21.270 --> 01:22:23.271
You're a grand old flag

01:22:23.272 --> 01:22:26.776
What a grand old flag

01:22:29.027 --> 01:22:34.615
Glory, glory, hallelujah

01:22:34.616 --> 01:22:39.829
Glory, glory, hallelujah

01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:44.417
Glory, glory, hallelujah

01:22:44.418 --> 01:22:50.425
His truth goes marching on

01:22:51.049 --> 01:22:53.676
And that government...

01:22:53.677 --> 01:22:56.137
...of the people...

01:22:56.138 --> 01:22:58.431
...by the people...

01:22:58.432 --> 01:23:02.436
...for the people,
shall not perish...

01:23:02.811 --> 01:23:05.313
...from the earth.

01:23:07.941 --> 01:23:10.359
When Johnny comes marching home again

01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:12.403
Hurrah, hurrah

01:23:12.404 --> 01:23:14.363
We'll give him a hearty welcome then

01:23:14.364 --> 01:23:16.491
Hurrah, hurrah

01:23:16.492 --> 01:23:18.493
The men will cheer
The boys will shout

01:23:18.494 --> 01:23:20.453
The ladies, they will all turn out

01:23:20.454 --> 01:23:25.255
And we'll all feel gay
When Johnny comes marching home

01:23:28.921 --> 01:23:31.088
We're one for all and all for one

01:23:31.089 --> 01:23:33.299
Behind the man
Behind the gun

01:23:33.300 --> 01:23:35.343
And now that we're in it
We're going to win it

01:23:35.344 --> 01:23:37.512
We can't lose a minute
There's work to be done

01:23:37.513 --> 01:23:39.597
We're with them
We're with them

01:23:39.598 --> 01:23:41.724
United we stand
In peace and war

01:23:41.725 --> 01:23:43.851
We're with them
We're with them

01:23:43.852 --> 01:23:45.686
We'll fight as we did before

01:23:45.687 --> 01:23:50.775
My country 'tis of thee

01:23:50.776 --> 01:23:55.571
Sweet land of liberty

01:23:55.572 --> 01:24:00.168
Of thee we sing

01:24:28.355 --> 01:24:32.149
You're a grand old flag
You're a high-flying flag

01:24:32.150 --> 01:24:35.945
And forever in peace may you wave

01:24:35.946 --> 01:24:40.074
You're the emblem of
The land I love

01:24:40.075 --> 01:24:43.578
The home of the free and the brave

01:24:43.579 --> 01:24:47.415
Every heart beats true
Under red, white and blue

01:24:47.416 --> 01:24:51.168
Where there's never a boast or brag

01:24:51.169 --> 01:24:55.172
But should old acquaintance be forgot

01:24:55.173 --> 01:24:58.718
Keep your eye on the grand old flag

01:24:58.719 --> 01:25:03.180
Should old acquaintance be forgot

01:25:03.181 --> 01:25:07.143
Keep your eye on the grand

01:25:07.144 --> 01:25:09.395
Old

01:25:09.396 --> 01:25:13.274
Flag

01:25:31.418 --> 01:25:33.836
Like the wandering minstrel

01:25:33.837 --> 01:25:38.049
I have slouched along the way

01:25:38.050 --> 01:25:41.552
Wandering day by day

01:25:41.553 --> 01:25:45.097
No selection of direction

01:25:45.098 --> 01:25:48.434
Till I heard a lovely voice

01:25:48.435 --> 01:25:52.188
Which seemed to softly say

01:25:52.189 --> 01:25:53.898
Come along with me

01:25:53.899 --> 01:25:58.199
Come along with me away

01:26:01.657 --> 01:26:03.783
May I have your autograph, Mr. Cohan?

01:26:03.784 --> 01:26:07.036
To what do you attribute
your continued success, Mr. Cohan?

01:26:07.037 --> 01:26:10.456
Oh, I'm an ordinary guy who knows
what ordinary guys like to see.

01:26:16.546 --> 01:26:19.465
Front row center, the greatest
show on earth, the people.

01:26:19.466 --> 01:26:21.843
To the people. God bless them.

01:26:27.099 --> 01:26:28.683
Here, chick, chick, chick.

01:26:28.684 --> 01:26:31.394
- Here, chick, chick, chick.
- Heh.

01:26:31.395 --> 01:26:34.563
Oh, it's such fun, Mother,
having cows and chickens.

01:26:34.564 --> 01:26:36.565
And everything's running so smoothly.

01:26:36.566 --> 01:26:38.651
Well, it's always been
a dream of ours, Mary.

01:26:38.652 --> 01:26:42.321
We kept hoping for 20 years
that it might come true someday.

01:26:42.322 --> 01:26:45.825
Imagine knowing how to feed chickens
or how much to feed them.

01:26:45.826 --> 01:26:47.785
And you're a farmer only three weeks.

01:26:47.786 --> 01:26:50.371
Jerry and I have seen
a lot of chickens in train windows...

01:26:50.372 --> 01:26:52.665
...and we always wanted
to raise some of our own.

01:26:52.666 --> 01:26:55.668
You know, watch them hatch
and feed them and eat them.

01:26:55.669 --> 01:26:59.093
If we only could. They're so pretty.

01:27:01.049 --> 01:27:02.675
- Georgie?
- Yeah?

01:27:02.676 --> 01:27:06.053
- What'd you get Dad for his birthday?
- Oh, nothing much. Just a smoking jacket.

01:27:06.054 --> 01:27:08.305
Is it bright? Lots of color?
I mean, will he like it?

01:27:08.306 --> 01:27:10.516
Well, it's silk and very red
and very yellow.

01:27:10.517 --> 01:27:13.861
That'll do it.
Look what I got him, Georgie.

01:27:13.937 --> 01:27:17.064
Well, now, there's a present.
That must have set you back a few.

01:27:17.065 --> 01:27:18.441
Dad needed a new watch.

01:27:18.442 --> 01:27:21.695
His old one's so loud, you can
hear it right through his coat.

01:27:24.239 --> 01:27:27.208
My future husband
helped me pick it out.

01:27:28.994 --> 01:27:30.461
Your future what?

01:27:31.329 --> 01:27:35.174
Husband. We're getting married
as soon as Fred's road tour is over.

01:27:36.460 --> 01:27:38.007
Well...

01:27:39.421 --> 01:27:41.093
Hm.

01:27:46.636 --> 01:27:48.353
Hm.

01:27:53.685 --> 01:27:56.279
Little Josie's gonna
get married, huh?

01:27:56.688 --> 01:27:58.606
Oh, it doesn't seem that long ago...

01:27:58.607 --> 01:28:00.575
Hmm.

01:28:01.151 --> 01:28:03.402
What happens to The Four Cohans?

01:28:03.403 --> 01:28:06.197
Oh, just a simple
case of subtraction.

01:28:06.198 --> 01:28:09.247
You know, one from four leaves three.

01:28:09.284 --> 01:28:11.869
- Three Cohans.
- Mm-mm.

01:28:11.870 --> 01:28:13.746
That's only arithmetic.

01:28:13.747 --> 01:28:17.000
One Cohan from four
Cohans leaves nothing.

01:28:17.375 --> 01:28:19.043
Mom and Pop know?

01:28:19.044 --> 01:28:21.046
Mm-hm.

01:28:21.296 --> 01:28:24.515
Mom's been working on the
wedding dress for weeks.

01:28:32.098 --> 01:28:34.521
What are you thinking about, Georgie?

01:28:39.314 --> 01:28:43.192
I'm gonna write you the most terrific
wedding march ever put on paper.

01:28:43.193 --> 01:28:45.787
It'll pack the pews.

01:28:48.156 --> 01:28:52.701
Say, Dad, will you tell Josie that
there's no reason to break up the act?

01:28:52.702 --> 01:28:55.120
The Four Cohans are as much
an institution as marriage is.

01:28:55.121 --> 01:28:57.790
Oh, Georgie, no one knows that
any better than I do...

01:28:57.791 --> 01:28:59.959
...but we want to settle down
and raise a family.

01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:02.962
What's the matter? Can't he raise a
family and be a stage manager too?

01:29:02.963 --> 01:29:04.755
- Hmm?
- George.

01:29:04.756 --> 01:29:08.806
George, I'm afraid your mother and I
are breaking up the act before Josie is.

01:29:14.432 --> 01:29:17.268
You hear that, Sam?
All three of them walking out on me.

01:29:17.269 --> 01:29:19.186
There's been a 40-year run, remember?

01:29:19.187 --> 01:29:21.564
We're giving you our two
weeks' notice, George. Heh.

01:29:21.565 --> 01:29:24.942
All we'd like to do now is spend
the rest of our days here on this farm.

01:29:24.943 --> 01:29:28.696
But you can't do that. You can't put an
actor out to grass. Fresh air kills him.

01:29:28.697 --> 01:29:30.948
We've gained nearly 10 pounds apiece.

01:29:30.949 --> 01:29:33.450
You can work it off. The show
is ready to go into rehearsal.

01:29:33.451 --> 01:29:35.870
There are grand parts
in it for both of you.

01:29:35.871 --> 01:29:37.580
No, George, I...

01:29:37.581 --> 01:29:39.623
We've had good times together.

01:29:39.624 --> 01:29:43.252
And, well, new shows need new faces
and new feet to go with you.

01:29:43.253 --> 01:29:46.427
From now on,
it's just you alone, son.

01:29:49.092 --> 01:29:50.342
Well, what's this?

01:29:50.343 --> 01:29:53.178
- A surprise, Dad.
- Happy birthday!

01:29:53.179 --> 01:29:56.181
- For me? Heh.
- You get your own birthday.

01:29:56.182 --> 01:29:58.601
- Look at the size of that one.
- Make a wish.

01:29:58.602 --> 01:30:00.060
- Make your wish.
- I have.

01:30:00.061 --> 01:30:01.904
A good one, Dad.

01:30:02.439 --> 01:30:04.773
Which one do you want to open first?

01:30:04.774 --> 01:30:07.401
How about opening this one?
Let me help you.

01:30:07.402 --> 01:30:11.155
- This one will match your suit, Dad.
- Somebody gave me that last year.

01:30:11.156 --> 01:30:12.656
Well, it looks fine.

01:30:12.657 --> 01:30:16.660
Had it made up on that old backdrop you
like so well, fireproofed and everything.

01:30:16.661 --> 01:30:19.038
Oh, darling, that's a
lovely watch. Heh.

01:30:19.039 --> 01:30:20.372
I'm so glad you like it, Dad.

01:30:20.373 --> 01:30:22.499
This is better
than being on next to closing.

01:30:22.500 --> 01:30:24.627
The only trouble is it's
three minutes fast.

01:30:24.628 --> 01:30:28.213
Heh-heh. Dad, press the little button
on the side and see what happens.

01:30:31.718 --> 01:30:34.386
It plays one on one
and segues into "Dixie."

01:30:34.387 --> 01:30:36.430
Here's some more ties
that you won't like, Jerry.

01:30:36.431 --> 01:30:39.434
I'll have to open up a store, huh?
Heh-heh.

01:30:39.768 --> 01:30:41.518
- Oh, uh...
- Here's a letter from George.

01:30:41.519 --> 01:30:44.480
- Don't open that now...
- You haven't written me a letter in 20 years.

01:30:44.481 --> 01:30:46.482
I'm gonna open it now,
and I'm gonna read it.

01:30:46.483 --> 01:30:49.485
George, this isn't your party.
Sit down and let him read his letter.

01:30:58.036 --> 01:31:02.331
"Dear Dad, this is your 62nd
birthday, and God bless you.

01:31:02.332 --> 01:31:06.502
Maybe I've never told you before,
but no son ever had a better dad...

01:31:06.503 --> 01:31:08.796
...or one to be prouder of.

01:31:08.797 --> 01:31:13.175
You and mother have always given me
more love and understanding...

01:31:13.176 --> 01:31:15.010
...than I ever deserved.

01:31:15.011 --> 01:31:19.848
And all the luck I've had is due
to the things you two have taught me.

01:31:19.849 --> 01:31:23.853
Nothing I can do could
ever repay the debt.

01:31:26.314 --> 01:31:30.109
But here's a little present
for you and mother.

01:31:30.110 --> 01:31:34.363
From this day on,
you and I are partners...

01:31:34.364 --> 01:31:39.618
...in every theater and
theatrical property I possess...

01:31:39.619 --> 01:31:41.291
...half and equal.

01:31:42.288 --> 01:31:46.792
The Cohan Theater,
the Astor, the Gaiety...

01:31:46.793 --> 01:31:49.261
...and the Grand Opera
House in Chicago...

01:31:50.630 --> 01:31:54.100
...and all my plays and songs
as long as they...

01:31:54.592 --> 01:31:57.515
...or you and I, live."

01:32:00.682 --> 01:32:03.526
These are not my reading glasses.

01:32:03.643 --> 01:32:07.363
Why didn't somebody give me
some reading glasses for my birthday?

01:32:07.814 --> 01:32:09.987
"Wish you all my love...

01:32:10.900 --> 01:32:14.119
...your son and partner, George."

01:32:16.698 --> 01:32:19.992
Well, George, on behalf
of your mother and myself, I...

01:32:22.412 --> 01:32:24.288
There she goes stealing
the scene again.

01:32:30.045 --> 01:32:31.712
One success followed another...

01:32:31.713 --> 01:32:33.756
...but there was one challenge
I hadn't met.

01:32:33.757 --> 01:32:36.925
Critics kept saying that musicals
and cheap comedies were all I could write.

01:32:36.926 --> 01:32:39.428
I could wave a flag, they said.
Nothing else.

01:32:39.429 --> 01:32:43.348
So I wrote a legitimate drama,
very deep and very significant.

01:32:43.349 --> 01:32:46.894
No music, no gags, no flag-waving.

01:32:46.895 --> 01:32:48.854
I called it Popularity.

01:32:48.855 --> 01:32:51.574
The title showed how
hard I was hoping.

01:32:51.733 --> 01:32:54.401
I couldn't attend the opening
because I was down the street...

01:32:54.402 --> 01:32:56.529
...in The Yankee Prince.

01:32:59.032 --> 01:33:01.450
- Open it up.
- Keep it closed, Buck.

01:33:01.451 --> 01:33:03.911
Cohan, you're surely not going
to your dressing room now.

01:33:03.912 --> 01:33:06.121
You're good for at least
another five curtain calls.

01:33:06.122 --> 01:33:07.539
That's enough for tonight.

01:33:07.540 --> 01:33:09.541
Mr. Cohan, are you sure
you're feeling well?

01:33:09.542 --> 01:33:12.044
I feel all right.
Any news from Popularity?

01:33:12.045 --> 01:33:14.213
No, but they should be
ringing down just about now.

01:33:14.214 --> 01:33:16.048
You'd think my family
would let me know.

01:33:16.049 --> 01:33:19.519
Well, it's a good sign. They probably
couldn't tear themselves away.

01:33:20.845 --> 01:33:22.346
- What time is it?
- Seven-thirty.

01:33:22.347 --> 01:33:23.889
- That clock right?
- Yes, sir.

01:33:23.890 --> 01:33:26.767
That's an early show.
They ought to be here by now.

01:33:26.768 --> 01:33:30.270
- Maybe something wrong with Mom and Dad.
- I've got reports on the minstrel show.

01:33:30.271 --> 01:33:32.898
- What'd we lose this week?
- Oh, 10,000, more or less.

01:33:32.899 --> 01:33:35.692
- What's the total loss so far?
- A few dollars under 200,000.

01:33:35.693 --> 01:33:38.320
Hmm. That include the
cost of the red ink?

01:33:38.321 --> 01:33:41.156
Popularity better be a hit.
Got a lot of dough sunk in that too.

01:33:41.157 --> 01:33:43.450
Eddie, call Wallachs and find out
what's keeping them.

01:33:43.451 --> 01:33:45.452
What did the papers say
about the minstrel show?

01:33:45.453 --> 01:33:47.830
Here they are. Rave notices again.

01:33:47.831 --> 01:33:49.748
Hmm, rave notices. That's bad.

01:33:49.749 --> 01:33:52.584
The better notices you get on minstrel
shows, the more it costs you.

01:33:52.585 --> 01:33:55.546
All except the last act.
Alecson suggests a new finish.

01:33:55.547 --> 01:33:58.257
Hmm, I see. A new finish. Hm.

01:33:58.258 --> 01:34:00.050
How about Saturday night?

01:34:00.051 --> 01:34:02.177
- Close it?
- Close it.

01:34:02.178 --> 01:34:04.096
- Saturday night.
- Mm-hm.

01:34:04.097 --> 01:34:06.431
- Give the company two weeks' salary.
- All right.

01:34:06.432 --> 01:34:08.934
- Oh, good evening, Mrs. Cohan.
- Good evening.

01:34:08.935 --> 01:34:12.146
- Hello, dear.
- Hello, Mom. Hi, darling.

01:34:12.147 --> 01:34:14.439
Dad, I was worried about you.
I wondered what happened.

01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:17.151
Sit down. Right here. You sit down.

01:34:17.152 --> 01:34:20.362
That theater's awfully cold, George.
Better have some more heat put in there.

01:34:20.363 --> 01:34:23.198
- Take care of that right away.
- Remember that skating act in Camden?

01:34:23.199 --> 01:34:25.492
They were there.
I wonder where they got the money.

01:34:25.493 --> 01:34:27.536
Finnegan, Feeney, and Riley.
I remember them well.

01:34:27.537 --> 01:34:29.454
Well, come on, tell me, how'd it go?

01:34:29.455 --> 01:34:32.583
Well, the audience loved it,
every minute of it.

01:34:32.625 --> 01:34:34.293
The sets were beautiful, George.

01:34:34.294 --> 01:34:36.296
Uh...

01:34:40.258 --> 01:34:41.884
Why so quiet, Sam?

01:34:41.885 --> 01:34:43.468
The toughest house I've ever seen.

01:34:43.469 --> 01:34:46.346
The critics walked out at
the end of the second act.

01:34:46.347 --> 01:34:48.099
Hmm.

01:34:49.309 --> 01:34:51.393
Mm-hm.

01:34:51.394 --> 01:34:53.520
Come on, Dad. Come on, let's have it.

01:34:53.521 --> 01:34:56.982
Heh. Well, there's no use
beating around the bush.

01:34:56.983 --> 01:34:58.942
Pretty bad, George.

01:34:58.943 --> 01:35:01.236
Could've been a lot better.

01:35:01.237 --> 01:35:04.948
All right, you write a bad play.
The only thing to do is forget about it.

01:35:04.949 --> 01:35:07.201
Everybody's entitled to one failure.

01:35:07.202 --> 01:35:10.537
Let's go to Delmonico's, have the party,
just as though the show was a hit.

01:35:10.538 --> 01:35:13.832
You take the girls on over there,
and I'll see you in about a half-hour.

01:35:13.833 --> 01:35:16.756
I've got some things I want
to talk over with Sam.

01:35:23.092 --> 01:35:25.177
Those critics have been
after my blood for years.

01:35:25.178 --> 01:35:28.347
They'll gang up on me and do a good
job of it, but I'll beat them to it.

01:35:28.348 --> 01:35:31.016
I'll take an ad in every paper
right alongside their reviews...

01:35:31.017 --> 01:35:33.727
...telling the public we've got
the greatest show in town...

01:35:33.728 --> 01:35:36.271
...sold out for 10 weeks in advance,
we'll run a year.

01:35:36.272 --> 01:35:38.357
The public will believe me.

01:35:38.358 --> 01:35:40.317
- Listen, Georgie, you can't do that.
- Why not?

01:35:40.318 --> 01:35:42.736
Too big a reputation.
You can't disappoint the public.

01:35:42.737 --> 01:35:44.780
They'll never forgive you,
never trust you again.

01:35:44.781 --> 01:35:47.659
We stuck our necks out,
and we got clipped.

01:35:47.951 --> 01:35:49.828
Georgie.

01:35:50.370 --> 01:35:52.329
You can't do this.
You'll always regret it.

01:35:52.330 --> 01:35:55.249
- Sit down and take this.
- We'll be sorry.

01:35:55.250 --> 01:35:57.626
- To the theater-going public.
- George...

01:35:57.627 --> 01:35:59.920
To the theater-going public.

01:35:59.921 --> 01:36:02.714
I wrote a play called Popularity.

01:36:02.715 --> 01:36:05.384
Mr. Harris and I produced that play.

01:36:05.385 --> 01:36:08.684
In the opinion of people we respect,
it is a bad play.

01:36:09.180 --> 01:36:11.223
In this, we heartily concur.

01:36:11.224 --> 01:36:14.022
It is a very bad play.

01:36:14.227 --> 01:36:16.395
I do humbly apologize
and ask forgiveness...

01:36:16.396 --> 01:36:19.648
...for having presented anything of
which you couldn't possibly approve.

01:36:19.649 --> 01:36:21.817
There will be five more performances.

01:36:21.818 --> 01:36:23.610
Please miss them.

01:36:23.611 --> 01:36:25.579
Signed...

01:36:25.947 --> 01:36:27.790
Happy?

01:36:29.117 --> 01:36:31.243
It's a wonderful second-act curtain.

01:36:31.244 --> 01:36:33.662
Send copies of this to all the
papers for the next edition.

01:36:33.663 --> 01:36:37.884
Extra! Lusitania
torpedoed by German sub!

01:36:55.560 --> 01:36:57.227
This is it, George.

01:36:57.228 --> 01:36:59.980
And we were worried about
the success or failure of a show.

01:36:59.981 --> 01:37:02.779
Now we've really got something
to worry about.

01:37:12.493 --> 01:37:13.952
It seems it always happens.

01:37:13.953 --> 01:37:17.289
Whenever we get too high-hat,
too sophisticated for flag-waving...

01:37:17.290 --> 01:37:21.084
...some thug nation decides we're a
pushover, all ready to be blackjacked.

01:37:21.085 --> 01:37:23.462
And it isn't long
before we're looking up anxiously...

01:37:23.463 --> 01:37:26.136
...to be sure the flag's
still waving over us.

01:37:37.018 --> 01:37:38.685
Left foot.

01:37:38.686 --> 01:37:40.187
Right foot.

01:37:40.188 --> 01:37:42.406
On your toes.

01:37:42.899 --> 01:37:44.524
I used to be a model.

01:37:44.525 --> 01:37:46.526
You'll look awful pretty
peeling potatoes.

01:37:46.527 --> 01:37:49.530
- On your way, wise guy.
- Next.

01:37:49.989 --> 01:37:51.907
Left foot. Right foot.

01:37:51.908 --> 01:37:55.577
All right. Take this paper and report to
Sergeant Cooper for your examination.

01:37:55.578 --> 01:37:58.205
Next. Name, please. Oh.

01:37:58.206 --> 01:38:00.499
"George M. Cohan.

01:38:00.500 --> 01:38:04.336
Occupation: actor, author,
composer, and producer.

01:38:04.337 --> 01:38:08.131
- Address: Devonshire Hotel."
- How do you know so much about me?

01:38:08.132 --> 01:38:12.135
Don't you recognize me, Mr. Cohan?
I used to be a clerk at the Friars Club.

01:38:12.136 --> 01:38:15.138
- Oh.
- Heh-heh. "Age: 39."

01:38:15.139 --> 01:38:18.934
- Doesn't even give me a chance to lie about it.
- Thirty-nine? I'm sorry, Mr. Cohan.

01:38:18.935 --> 01:38:23.063
- You're overage. Thirty-one's the limit now.
- What's eight or nine years, more or less?

01:38:23.064 --> 01:38:26.483
- The Germans won't ask for a birth certificate.
- I know how you feel, Mr. Cohan...

01:38:26.484 --> 01:38:28.735
...but you've got to be young
and tough for this army.

01:38:28.736 --> 01:38:30.737
It's no picnic, all those hardships.

01:38:30.738 --> 01:38:33.740
The mental strain, the trenches,
the fighting, the marching.

01:38:33.741 --> 01:38:35.742
- And the mademoiselles.
- I hope.

01:38:35.743 --> 01:38:39.454
- No, you'll never be able to stand it.
- Hardships and physical strain?

01:38:39.455 --> 01:38:41.623
Young man, you don't know
what you're talking about.

01:38:41.624 --> 01:38:44.501
This war's a coffee klatsch compared
to a season with a musical show.

01:38:44.502 --> 01:38:46.253
I'd like to see
these kids do what I do...

01:38:46.254 --> 01:38:48.547
...in a performance
and be on their feet at the finish.

01:38:48.548 --> 01:38:50.675
I'll give you an idea of what I mean.

01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:08.024
Well, thank you very much
for your entertainment, Mr. Cohan...

01:39:08.025 --> 01:39:10.861
...but I'm afraid we have more need
of you here than over there.

01:39:10.862 --> 01:39:12.863
Well, that'll make the war
last a year longer.

01:39:14.031 --> 01:39:16.700
- Good-bye, Mr. Cohan.
- Thank you, major. Thank you.

01:39:16.701 --> 01:39:18.953
- So long.
- Good-bye.

01:40:21.891 --> 01:40:25.602
Johnny, get your gun
Get your gun, get your gun

01:40:25.603 --> 01:40:29.189
Take it on the run
On the run, on the run

01:40:29.190 --> 01:40:32.859
Hear them calling you and me

01:40:32.860 --> 01:40:36.655
Every son of liberty

01:40:36.656 --> 01:40:40.242
Hurry, right away!
No delay. Go today.

01:40:40.243 --> 01:40:43.912
Make your daddy glad
To have had such a fad

01:40:43.913 --> 01:40:47.165
Tell your sweetheart not to pine

01:40:47.166 --> 01:40:50.961
To be proud her boy's in line

01:40:50.962 --> 01:40:54.506
Over there
Over there

01:40:54.507 --> 01:40:58.176
Send the word, send the word
Over there

01:40:58.177 --> 01:41:00.345
That the Yanks are coming

01:41:00.346 --> 01:41:02.138
The Yanks are coming

01:41:02.139 --> 01:41:05.559
The drums rum-tumming everywhere

01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:08.895
So prepare Say a prayer

01:41:08.896 --> 01:41:12.899

Pick it up, soldier.
Keep singing, Nora.

01:41:30.209 --> 01:41:33.044
- Where are the lights?
- The generator's gone again.

01:41:33.045 --> 01:41:35.380
Hit your lights
so we can keep going, will ya?

01:41:35.381 --> 01:41:37.048
- All right.
- Fine, thanks.

01:41:37.049 --> 01:41:39.843
Hit your lights and keep them
on the singer until the others come.

01:41:39.844 --> 01:41:41.636
- Certainly.
- Fine. Thanks very much.

01:41:41.637 --> 01:41:44.389
That the Yanks are coming

01:41:44.390 --> 01:41:46.308
The Yanks are coming

01:41:46.309 --> 01:41:49.644

And we won't come back
Till it's over over there

01:42:04.869 --> 01:42:06.745
Everybody sing!

The Yanks are coming

01:42:22.011 --> 01:42:26.097
The drums rum-tumming everywhere

01:42:26.098 --> 01:42:28.224
So prepare

01:42:28.225 --> 01:42:30.393

Send the word, send the word

01:42:34.482 --> 01:42:36.816
We'll be over

01:42:36.817 --> 01:42:39.152
We're coming over

01:42:39.153 --> 01:42:43.657
And we won't come back
Till it's over over there

01:43:13.521 --> 01:43:14.896
We'd won the World War.

01:43:14.897 --> 01:43:17.357
Manhattan went wild
with postwar hysteria.

01:43:17.358 --> 01:43:19.401
But I spiked my shows
with prewar stuff...

01:43:19.402 --> 01:43:22.362
...the sentiment and humor an older
America had aged in the wood.

01:43:22.363 --> 01:43:25.156
In a kingdom all our own

01:43:25.157 --> 01:43:28.201
With little cupid on the throne

01:43:28.202 --> 01:43:31.830
With a prince
And princess on my knee

01:43:31.831 --> 01:43:34.833
You'll be as happy as can be

01:43:34.834 --> 01:43:38.044
In a love nest

01:43:38.045 --> 01:43:41.256
Cozy and warm

01:43:41.257 --> 01:43:44.426
Like a dove nest

01:43:44.427 --> 01:43:47.595
Down on a farm

01:43:47.596 --> 01:43:51.266
And it's all daylong

01:43:51.267 --> 01:43:52.684
They bray

01:43:52.685 --> 01:43:55.729
Flowers all dripping with dew

01:43:55.730 --> 01:44:00.066
And they join in the chorus
Of Nellie Kelly

01:44:00.067 --> 01:44:04.195
I love you

01:44:04.196 --> 01:44:07.615
He is the man
Who owns Broadway

01:44:07.616 --> 01:44:10.785
That's what the daily papers say

01:44:10.786 --> 01:44:13.371
Oh, where could you find another?

01:44:13.372 --> 01:44:15.373
I'd like to be shown

01:44:15.374 --> 01:44:19.794
Another like Molly Malone

01:44:19.795 --> 01:44:24.507
But I love the name Billie

01:44:24.508 --> 01:44:26.885
My dad's was the same

01:44:26.886 --> 01:44:29.809
Billie

01:44:41.275 --> 01:44:44.152
Still, it was lonely
on the main stem.

01:44:44.153 --> 01:44:46.112
Mother and Josie were gone.

01:44:46.113 --> 01:44:49.032
Dad was by himself on the farm
and had grown very old.

01:44:49.033 --> 01:44:52.202
Every night I went to the theater,
I expected a phone call.

01:44:52.203 --> 01:44:55.047
Well, finally it came.

01:45:03.631 --> 01:45:06.466
You'd better give him two more ccs.

01:45:06.467 --> 01:45:09.052
We might as well try to make
him as comfortable as possible.

01:45:09.053 --> 01:45:11.429
Yes, Dr. Anderson.

01:45:11.430 --> 01:45:15.850
If you have to get back to town,
Dr. Llewellyn, I'll be here all night.

01:45:15.851 --> 01:45:19.145
It's all right. I'll wait till George M.
gets here from the theater.

01:45:19.146 --> 01:45:22.490
- Cigarette, doctor?
- Yes, I will.

01:45:22.817 --> 01:45:24.275
Thanks.

01:45:24.276 --> 01:45:27.028
I remember I was a kid
in medical college in Baltimore...

01:45:27.029 --> 01:45:29.702
...when I first saw The Four Cohans.

01:45:29.824 --> 01:45:31.950
They were a great act.

01:45:31.951 --> 01:45:33.953
Yes, they were.

01:45:36.497 --> 01:45:41.084
I always thought George M.'s sister
was the loveliest dancer I'd ever seen.

01:45:41.085 --> 01:45:45.171
Can't help thinking a theatrical era
is dying in there.

01:45:45.172 --> 01:45:48.591
His sister and his mother gone
and now the old man.

01:45:48.592 --> 01:45:51.803
In some ways, I think he was
the best performer of the lot.

01:45:51.804 --> 01:45:54.806
Well, I'd settle for his age.

01:45:54.807 --> 01:45:57.809
There never was anything dull
about his life, either.

01:45:57.810 --> 01:46:00.562
And he's lived to see his son
an American institution.

01:46:00.563 --> 01:46:02.188
Yeah.

01:46:02.189 --> 01:46:04.236
I'd settle for that too.

01:46:09.697 --> 01:46:11.447
Hello, Mr. Cohan.

01:46:11.448 --> 01:46:13.283
- How is he?
- Resting quietly.

01:46:13.284 --> 01:46:15.786
Oh. I see.

01:46:17.329 --> 01:46:19.831
I think you'd better go in alone.

01:46:24.587 --> 01:46:27.297
We can't... We can't do that.

01:46:27.298 --> 01:46:29.507
Wait till George gets here.
Where's George?

01:46:29.508 --> 01:46:31.976
Here I am, Dad. Here I am.

01:46:32.052 --> 01:46:35.772
Oh, that's good. I'm glad you came.

01:46:36.015 --> 01:46:38.766
The booking office
has been calling up all day...

01:46:38.767 --> 01:46:41.853
...and they want us to play Des
Moines the last half of the week.

01:46:41.854 --> 01:46:45.064
Don't worry about that.
We're not going to. I've canceled it.

01:46:45.065 --> 01:46:47.693
We can pick it up on the way back.

01:46:48.485 --> 01:46:52.572
- How did it go tonight? Mmm.
- Oh, fine. Fine. Yeah.

01:46:52.573 --> 01:46:56.409
It's not every kid gets that gets
the chance to play Peck's bad boy.

01:46:56.410 --> 01:46:58.036
That's right.

01:46:58.037 --> 01:47:02.123
Were you...? Were you nervous?
Did you remember your lines?

01:47:02.124 --> 01:47:03.875
Oh, sure. Every one.

01:47:03.876 --> 01:47:07.004
- "I can lick any kid in town."
- Heh. Good.

01:47:07.963 --> 01:47:12.133
Now, don't you upstage your mother,
or I'll whale the tar out of you.

01:47:12.134 --> 01:47:14.928
Don't worry, Dad. I'll never do that.

01:47:14.929 --> 01:47:17.221
I'll play the whole show
with one foot in the trough.

01:47:17.222 --> 01:47:20.350
No, no, no. We've been
billed as The Four Cohans.

01:47:20.351 --> 01:47:22.268
You're not gonna break up the act.

01:47:22.269 --> 01:47:23.937
Don't worry, Dad. They never will.

01:47:23.938 --> 01:47:26.907
We won't let them. Won't let them.

01:47:27.524 --> 01:47:29.692
How many curtain calls
did you take tonight?

01:47:29.693 --> 01:47:31.736
Six. Six curtains.

01:47:31.737 --> 01:47:34.956
- That's pretty good for a drama.
- Yeah.

01:47:36.033 --> 01:47:40.629
- Did you make a speech?
- Mm-hm. I thanked them for us.

01:47:41.413 --> 01:47:43.623
I said, "My mother thanks you...

01:47:43.624 --> 01:47:46.167
...my father thanks you...

01:47:46.168 --> 01:47:48.796
...my sister thanks you...

01:47:49.296 --> 01:47:51.969
...and I thank you.

01:48:57.990 --> 01:49:00.037
Well...

01:49:01.702 --> 01:49:05.329
...it was a good combination, Sam,
worked well for a long time.

01:49:05.330 --> 01:49:08.124
Yeah, now that it's all over,
who was the senior partner...

01:49:08.125 --> 01:49:09.667
...and who was the junior partner?

01:49:09.668 --> 01:49:11.669
You mean, who was Dietz
and who was Goff?

01:49:11.670 --> 01:49:15.965
Well, I bet it's the first firm in the history
of show business had two senior partners.

01:49:15.966 --> 01:49:18.301
Well, uh, you know how I feel,
don't you, Sam?

01:49:18.302 --> 01:49:20.344
Sure. I understand.

01:49:20.345 --> 01:49:23.639
You know, when Dad died, with him went
the last link with The Four Cohans.

01:49:23.640 --> 01:49:27.602
All the backslapping and the applause,
well, it became unimportant.

01:49:27.603 --> 01:49:29.353
No more fun in it.

01:49:29.354 --> 01:49:32.858
It didn't mean anything anymore
with Dad, Mom and Josie gone.

01:49:33.525 --> 01:49:36.444
So Mary and I are going away
and enjoy ourselves...

01:49:36.445 --> 01:49:38.571
...and visit places
we've always wanted to see...

01:49:38.572 --> 01:49:41.949
...old theaters where nobody
ever even heard of us.

01:49:41.950 --> 01:49:43.952
You'll have to go to Timbuktu.

01:49:44.203 --> 01:49:45.369
We've got it booked.

01:49:45.370 --> 01:49:48.664
George, you've always been
the one with the words.

01:49:48.665 --> 01:49:51.839
I never was much of a hand
at saying things.

01:49:52.127 --> 01:49:55.471
But we've done more
than make a lot of money...

01:49:55.839 --> 01:49:57.807
...and lose a little.

01:49:58.050 --> 01:50:02.020
Sometimes friends drift apart.
Let's not let that happen to us.

01:50:02.429 --> 01:50:05.306
No matter how legal the dissolution
of this partnership is, Sam...

01:50:05.307 --> 01:50:07.809
...50 percent of me will
always be here in this office.

01:50:07.810 --> 01:50:09.936
I'll remember that
when the rent comes due.

01:50:09.937 --> 01:50:11.604
You'll be more successful than ever.

01:50:11.605 --> 01:50:15.274
But if ever the rent does come due
and you can't meet it, well, you know...

01:50:15.275 --> 01:50:17.944
...and by the same token,
if I get stuck in Madagascar...

01:50:17.945 --> 01:50:19.992
Heh-heh. ...you'll hear from me.

01:50:21.657 --> 01:50:23.909
You'd better get out of here.

01:50:25.786 --> 01:50:28.505
That ship will sail without you.

01:50:34.837 --> 01:50:36.963
- Seasick pills.
- Mm-hm.

01:50:36.964 --> 01:50:38.965
I won't go to the boat with you.

01:50:38.966 --> 01:50:41.184
You know how red my nose gets.

01:50:43.428 --> 01:50:46.180
What's this? We thought you guys
weren't speaking to each other.

01:50:46.181 --> 01:50:48.975
Can we have a picture
of you tearing up your contract?

01:50:48.976 --> 01:50:52.150
That's impossible.
We never had a written contract.

01:50:52.604 --> 01:50:54.438
The only contract we've ever had.

01:50:54.439 --> 01:50:56.899
Hold that pose. We want to
show it to our legal department.

01:50:56.900 --> 01:50:58.572
Shoot it, boys.

01:51:03.657 --> 01:51:06.534
Life was less full, but it
was by no means empty.

01:51:06.535 --> 01:51:09.954
I still had Mary,
a playmate as well as a helpmate.

01:51:09.955 --> 01:51:12.674
We set out to rubberneck
at the world.

01:51:18.297 --> 01:51:21.048
Nelson monument. It's a good thing
I wasn't born an Englishman.

01:51:21.049 --> 01:51:24.098
With the history their flag has,
I'd have waved myself to death.

01:51:27.514 --> 01:51:29.891
Oh, George,
I didn't know you could yodel.

01:51:29.892 --> 01:51:33.737
Learned it on the farm.
Nothing but hog-calling with frost on it.

01:51:42.487 --> 01:51:44.864
It takes two men to impersonate
a horse on Broadway.

01:51:44.865 --> 01:51:47.914
And you always have trouble
casting the front end.

01:51:53.540 --> 01:51:56.167
But folks always come back
to where their heart is...

01:51:56.168 --> 01:51:57.835
...so we came back to the farm...

01:51:57.836 --> 01:52:01.715
...the farm we Cohans had dreamed
of when farmers were envying us.

01:52:13.060 --> 01:52:17.360
Hey, mister, our radiator needs some H20.
Can we use your well?

01:52:17.731 --> 01:52:20.024
Sure, go ahead. Help yourselves.

01:52:20.025 --> 01:52:22.568
Come on, Jack.
Let's make this hop-up solid.

01:52:22.569 --> 01:52:26.494
Okay, Jackson, come on.
This isn't any free jitney.

01:52:26.615 --> 01:52:27.823
Radiator busted?

01:52:27.824 --> 01:52:30.076
Nah. It's only got
high blood pressure.

01:52:30.077 --> 01:52:32.203
What are you gonna do about tires
if those give out?

01:52:32.204 --> 01:52:34.330
Oh, it'll run a lot
smoother on the rims.

01:52:34.331 --> 01:52:37.004
"Stix nix hix pix."

01:52:37.251 --> 01:52:39.377
Greek. I'll bet that's Greek talk.

01:52:39.378 --> 01:52:42.296
That ain't Greek. That's Swedish
or Russian. Stix nix hix pix.

01:52:42.297 --> 01:52:44.882
That's show business talk.
Here, I'll translate it for you.

01:52:44.883 --> 01:52:49.262
"Stix," small towns, "nix," refuse,
"hix," rube, "pix," pictures.

01:52:49.263 --> 01:52:52.056
"Small towns refuse rube pictures."
Stix nix hix pix.

01:52:52.057 --> 01:52:53.933
- Stix nix hix pix.
- Stix nix hix pix.

01:52:53.934 --> 01:52:56.644
A-stix a-nix hix a-pix

01:52:56.645 --> 01:52:58.437
A-stix a-nix hix pix

01:52:58.438 --> 01:53:00.856
- I thought that was new jive talk.
- New what talk?

01:53:00.857 --> 01:53:02.608
- Jive talk.
- Oh.

01:53:02.609 --> 01:53:04.610
- Are you an actor, sir?
- Used to be.

01:53:04.611 --> 01:53:06.779
- What were some of your pictures?
- Not in pictures.

01:53:06.780 --> 01:53:08.781
I was on Broadway
in the legitimate theater.

01:53:08.782 --> 01:53:11.033
Oh. What's your name, sir?

01:53:11.034 --> 01:53:12.576
- Cohan.
- Cohen?

01:53:12.577 --> 01:53:14.537
Cohan. George M. Cohan.

01:53:14.538 --> 01:53:17.415
- You must have been before our time.
- Yes, guess I was.

01:53:17.416 --> 01:53:19.083
Were you ever in some big shows?

01:53:19.084 --> 01:53:20.710
- Yeah, a few.
- Like what?

01:53:20.711 --> 01:53:23.546
Oh, uh, like, uh,
Little Nellie Kelly.

01:53:23.547 --> 01:53:25.673
- The Tavern. Ah, Wilderness!
- Uh-uh.

01:53:25.674 --> 01:53:27.925
Mmm. Raised in a vacuum bottle.

01:53:27.926 --> 01:53:31.012
Well, I guess your parents must have
seen me, uh, fathers and mothers.

01:53:31.013 --> 01:53:33.431
Maybe they have. I never
heard them talk about it.

01:53:33.432 --> 01:53:36.309
Have you ever heard a song called, uh,
"Give My Regards to Broadway"?

01:53:36.310 --> 01:53:39.279
- I don't think so.
- Mmm. No, sir. Who sang it?

01:53:39.479 --> 01:53:42.148
- Who sang it?
- Oh, was it a theme song or something?

01:53:42.149 --> 01:53:46.110
- Did that follow "Beat Me Daddy, 8 to the Bar"?
- Yes! Or "Jeepers Creepers."

01:53:46.111 --> 01:53:48.487
Jeepers creepers

01:53:48.488 --> 01:53:50.656
Where'd you get those peepers?

01:53:50.657 --> 01:53:53.159
Jeepers creepers

01:53:53.160 --> 01:53:54.827
Where'd you get those eyes?

01:53:54.828 --> 01:53:56.412
Come on, kids. Time's a-wasting.

01:53:56.413 --> 01:53:58.497
Well, we gotta scram now.
Swinging session.

01:53:58.498 --> 01:54:00.791
Thank you very much, mister...
What was your name again?

01:54:00.792 --> 01:54:03.420
Cohan. George Cohan.

01:54:03.795 --> 01:54:05.296
Good-bye, Georgie.

01:54:05.297 --> 01:54:07.174
You're cute!

01:54:07.257 --> 01:54:09.967
Nice old guy. We gotta get
to that session, let's go.

01:54:09.968 --> 01:54:12.636
Come on, we got places
to go and things to do.

01:54:14.222 --> 01:54:16.190
Bye!

01:54:20.854 --> 01:54:22.981
They did that.

01:54:23.106 --> 01:54:25.191
I'm not angry,
but it is very discouraging.

01:54:25.192 --> 01:54:28.694
Kid asked me my name, and I said Cohan.
He asked me again, and I said Cohan.

01:54:28.695 --> 01:54:32.031
Hm. Never even heard of me. Sixteen
years old, and I bet you he can't read.

01:54:32.032 --> 01:54:34.825
But you've been away from that
theater for years, George. Years.

01:54:34.826 --> 01:54:37.161
Nine or 10 generations
have grown up since then.

01:54:37.162 --> 01:54:40.289
Naturally, they don't remember you.
Nobody's got that good a memory.

01:54:40.290 --> 01:54:43.709
Why not? Many generations remembered
my father and mother in vaudeville.

01:54:43.710 --> 01:54:47.088
That's because they were real troupers.
They stayed with it.

01:54:47.089 --> 01:54:49.673
Your father could do a buck-and-wing
when he was 60 years old.

01:54:49.674 --> 01:54:52.635
- What makes you think I can't?
- I'd hate to see you try it.

01:54:52.636 --> 01:54:56.013
Your father never sat around an orchard
listening to his arteries hardening.

01:54:56.014 --> 01:54:58.557
- Nothing the matter with my arteries.
- No, not right now...

01:54:58.558 --> 01:55:01.560
...because those kids
got you all worked up.

01:55:01.561 --> 01:55:03.687
You're picking on me
for a reason, Mary.

01:55:03.688 --> 01:55:07.032
You're trying to get a rise out of me.
Come on, let's have it. What is it?

01:55:07.359 --> 01:55:09.702
All right. Here it is.

01:55:10.028 --> 01:55:12.905
I got a long-distance call from
Sam Harris this afternoon.

01:55:12.906 --> 01:55:14.365
What about?

01:55:14.366 --> 01:55:16.951
He's producing a new show
by Kaufman and Hart.

01:55:16.952 --> 01:55:19.921
They're good writers.
Nothing I could do to improve their stuff.

01:55:20.122 --> 01:55:22.966
Sam thinks you could,
if you played the lead.

01:55:23.625 --> 01:55:26.377
Play the lead? Now, what is
the matter with that man?

01:55:26.378 --> 01:55:29.839
Hasn't he got any sense at all?
What's he trying to do, spoil our fun?

01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:32.049
But are you having fun, George?

01:55:32.050 --> 01:55:34.510
When we were in Europe,
you haunted every theater...

01:55:34.511 --> 01:55:36.887
...not knowing a word
that was said onstage.

01:55:36.888 --> 01:55:38.806
Going back,
congratulating the actors...

01:55:38.807 --> 01:55:41.142
They didn't even know what
you were talking about.

01:55:41.143 --> 01:55:43.102
...Just to smell that
greasepaint again.

01:55:43.103 --> 01:55:44.645
You think I'm stagestruck.

01:55:44.646 --> 01:55:47.773
The only reason I ever go near a
theater is to get out of the night air.

01:55:47.774 --> 01:55:50.067
Fun? I'm having a wonderful time.

01:55:50.068 --> 01:55:52.662
I have nothing to do with Broadway.

01:55:52.779 --> 01:55:56.449
Sam says it's a great part, no other
actor in the world but you could do it.

01:55:56.450 --> 01:55:58.492
That's just some more
of that Harris con.

01:55:58.493 --> 01:56:01.120
He needs me about as much
as he needs a hole in the head.

01:56:01.121 --> 01:56:03.747
He really does need you, George.
He's in trouble.

01:56:03.748 --> 01:56:08.128
If positions were reversed, he'd help
you out. You know he would.

01:56:08.336 --> 01:56:11.385
Besides, he never said so,
but Sam's broke.

01:56:12.257 --> 01:56:14.509
Can you think of any more reasons?

01:56:16.219 --> 01:56:18.687
Yes. I want you to.

01:56:18.930 --> 01:56:21.807
Well, that settled it.

01:56:21.808 --> 01:56:23.809
I've never refused you
anything, have I?

01:56:23.810 --> 01:56:26.145
We do it. Come on, let's get packing.

01:56:26.146 --> 01:56:28.319
We're all packed.

01:56:28.899 --> 01:56:30.366
What?

01:56:30.942 --> 01:56:33.319
We're all packed, dear.

01:56:33.612 --> 01:56:35.988
Now you can start getting
mad all over again...

01:56:35.989 --> 01:56:39.158
...because I told Sam
I'd talk you into it.

01:56:43.538 --> 01:56:46.165
What are you laughing about?

01:56:46.166 --> 01:56:49.543
Just full of news, aren't you?
Telling me all kinds of things, huh?

01:56:49.544 --> 01:56:51.587
Well, I want you to know
I knew it all the time.

01:56:51.588 --> 01:56:55.466
I was listening in on the phone downstairs
while you were talking to Sam.

01:56:55.467 --> 01:56:58.469
Why, you devil.
You knew it all the time!

01:56:58.470 --> 01:57:01.555
And what's more, I phoned Sam
right back and told him I'd play it.

01:57:01.556 --> 01:57:03.516
Oh, I ought to pop you.

01:57:03.517 --> 01:57:06.143
- You... You...
- Heh-heh-heh. Oh!

01:57:06.144 --> 01:57:08.487
- Oh.
- Oh.

01:57:26.665 --> 01:57:29.293
It's really a wonderful job

01:57:29.793 --> 01:57:32.920
For fellows like George,
Abe and me too

01:57:32.921 --> 01:57:35.839
It's great to shake hands with a mob

01:57:35.840 --> 01:57:39.051
And to hold every kid
on your knee too

01:57:39.052 --> 01:57:42.346
Every word that I speak
Goes into headlines

01:57:42.347 --> 01:57:45.349
When I speak
All the papers hold their deadlines

01:57:45.350 --> 01:57:47.935
But I have found a way
Of dropping a hint

01:57:47.936 --> 01:57:52.022
Or a glint of the truth
That the boys cannot print

01:57:52.023 --> 01:57:53.607
For instance

01:57:53.608 --> 01:57:55.655
For instance

01:57:58.363 --> 01:58:00.072
When I was courting Eleanor

01:58:00.073 --> 01:58:02.950
I told her Uncle Teddy
I wouldn't run for president

01:58:02.951 --> 01:58:04.702
Unless the job was steady

01:58:04.703 --> 01:58:07.626
Don't print it
Strictly off the record

01:58:07.789 --> 01:58:11.041
We entertained the royalty
But we were never flustered

01:58:11.042 --> 01:58:14.253
We gave them Yankee hot dogs
With Colman's English Mustard

01:58:14.254 --> 01:58:17.052
Don't print it
Strictly off the record

01:58:17.299 --> 01:58:20.384
It's pleasant at the White House
But I'll tell you how I feel

01:58:20.385 --> 01:58:23.554
The food is simply terrible
Just sauerkraut and veal

01:58:23.555 --> 01:58:26.724
If Mrs. R. would stay at home
I'd get a decent meal

01:58:26.725 --> 01:58:29.648
But that's off the record

01:59:08.058 --> 01:59:09.642
When I go up to Hyde Park

01:59:09.643 --> 01:59:11.310
It's not for just the ride there

01:59:11.311 --> 01:59:12.853
It's not that I like Hyde Park

01:59:12.854 --> 01:59:14.647
But I love to park and hide there

01:59:14.648 --> 01:59:16.900
Don't print it
It's strictly off the record

01:59:17.651 --> 01:59:20.778
I sit up in my study
Writing gags for Mr. Ickes

01:59:20.779 --> 01:59:22.404
And insults for the gentlemen

01:59:22.405 --> 01:59:24.073
Who'd love to slip him Mickeys

01:59:24.074 --> 01:59:26.997
Don't print that
Off the record

01:59:42.801 --> 01:59:46.095
I scrapped the Prohibition Act
When we required a bracer

01:59:46.096 --> 01:59:49.390
And finished up the Boulder Dam
To give the boys a chaser

01:59:49.391 --> 01:59:52.393
Don't print it
It's strictly off the record

01:59:52.394 --> 01:59:55.604
And for my friends in Washington
Who complain about the taxes

01:59:55.605 --> 01:59:58.857
Who cares as long as we can knock
The ax out of the Axis?

01:59:58.858 --> 02:00:01.902
Don't print it
It's strictly off the record

02:00:01.903 --> 02:00:05.155
I can't forget how Lafayette
Helped give us our first chance

02:00:05.156 --> 02:00:08.242
To win our fight for liberty
And now they've taken France

02:00:08.243 --> 02:00:11.328
We'll take it back from Hitler
And put ants in his Ja-pants

02:00:11.329 --> 02:00:14.081
And that's for the record

02:00:29.681 --> 02:00:32.980
Good work, kids. I'll see
you at 11 in the morning.

02:00:35.437 --> 02:00:38.690
And then came your wire,
and I was really worried.

02:00:38.898 --> 02:00:42.151
Well, here I am going on like Tennyson's
book, giving you the story of my life.

02:00:42.152 --> 02:00:44.278
I'm sorry. You should've stopped me.

02:00:44.279 --> 02:00:46.947
Why, I wanted to hear
the story of your life.

02:00:46.948 --> 02:00:50.534
It has a direct bearing
on my sending for you.

02:00:50.535 --> 02:00:53.003
Do you know what this is?

02:00:54.164 --> 02:00:55.706
The Congressional Medal of Honor.

02:00:55.707 --> 02:00:58.175
Let's see what the inscription says.

02:01:10.889 --> 02:01:13.348
I congratulate you, Mr. Cohan.

02:01:13.349 --> 02:01:17.811
I understand you're the first person
of your profession to receive this honor.

02:01:17.812 --> 02:01:20.063
You should be very proud.

02:01:20.064 --> 02:01:21.774
Oh, I am proud.

02:01:21.775 --> 02:01:23.525
In fact, I'm flabbergasted.

02:01:23.526 --> 02:01:25.778
First time in my life,
I'm speechless.

02:01:25.779 --> 02:01:28.530
Uh... You're sure there
isn't some mistake?

02:01:28.531 --> 02:01:30.749
Quite sure.

02:01:31.618 --> 02:01:35.370
This medal is for people who've given their
lives for their country or done something big.

02:01:35.371 --> 02:01:37.956
I'm just a song-and-dance man.
Everybody knows that.

02:01:37.957 --> 02:01:42.961
A man may give his life to his country
in many different ways, Mr. Cohan.

02:01:42.962 --> 02:01:47.382
And quite often, he isn't the best judge
of how much he has given.

02:01:47.383 --> 02:01:51.053
Your songs were a symbol
of the American spirit.

02:01:51.054 --> 02:01:55.098
"Over There" was just as powerful
a weapon as any cannon...

02:01:55.099 --> 02:01:58.727
...as any battleship we had
in the first World War.

02:01:58.728 --> 02:02:02.356
Today, we're all soldiers.
We're all on the front.

02:02:02.357 --> 02:02:05.484
We need more songs
to express America.

02:02:05.485 --> 02:02:09.363
I know you and your comrades
will give them to us.

02:02:09.364 --> 02:02:13.450
Mr. President, I've just
begun to earn this medal.

02:02:13.451 --> 02:02:15.077
It's quite a thing.

02:02:15.078 --> 02:02:20.630
Well, it's the best material we
could find, what with priorities and all.

02:02:21.626 --> 02:02:23.844
Good-bye, sir.

02:02:23.962 --> 02:02:27.631
And I want you to know
that I'm not the only one that's grateful.

02:02:27.632 --> 02:02:29.758
My mother thanks you,
my father thanks you...

02:02:29.759 --> 02:02:33.136
...my sister thanks you,
and I assure you, I thank you.

02:02:33.137 --> 02:02:36.849
And, uh, I wouldn't worry
about this country if I were you.

02:02:36.850 --> 02:02:38.684
We've got this thing licked.

02:02:38.685 --> 02:02:42.688
Where else could a plain guy like me come
in and talk things over with the head man?

02:02:42.689 --> 02:02:45.190
Well, that's about as good
a definition of America...

02:02:45.191 --> 02:02:47.067
...as any I've ever heard.

02:02:47.068 --> 02:02:49.528
Good-bye, Mr. Cohan, and good luck.

02:02:49.529 --> 02:02:52.282
Good-bye, sir, and good luck to you.

02:03:51.049 --> 02:03:52.966
Over there

02:03:52.967 --> 02:03:55.052
Over there

02:03:55.053 --> 02:03:59.056
Send the word, send the word
Over there

02:03:59.057 --> 02:04:01.391
That the Yanks are coming

02:04:01.392 --> 02:04:03.268
The Yanks are coming

02:04:03.269 --> 02:04:06.897
The drums rum-tumming everywhere

02:04:06.898 --> 02:04:11.151
So prepare
Say a prayer

02:04:11.152 --> 02:04:15.113
Send the word, send the word
To beware

02:04:15.114 --> 02:04:16.907
We'll be over

02:04:16.908 --> 02:04:19.076
We're coming over

02:04:19.077 --> 02:04:21.912
And we won't come back
Till it's over

02:04:21.913 --> 02:04:24.873
What's the matter, old-timer?
Don't you remember this song?

02:04:24.874 --> 02:04:26.792
Seems to me I do.

02:04:26.793 --> 02:04:28.627
Well, I don't hear anything.

02:04:28.628 --> 02:04:31.088
Send the word over there

02:04:31.089 --> 02:04:33.423
That the Yanks are coming

02:04:33.424 --> 02:04:35.092
The Yanks are coming

02:04:35.093 --> 02:04:39.096
The drums rum-tumming everywhere

02:04:39.097 --> 02:04:43.141
So prepare
Say a prayer

02:04:43.142 --> 02:04:47.145
Send the word, send the word
To beware

02:04:47.146 --> 02:04:51.149
We'll be over
We're coming over

02:04:51.150 --> 02:04:55.871
And we won't come back
Till it's over over there

02:04:56.305 --> 02:05:02.576
