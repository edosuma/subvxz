<i>Previously on Devious Maids...</i>

00:01.609 --> 00:03.433
This picture could destroy
his career.

00:03.468 --> 00:04.801
We need to get him married.

00:04.836 --> 00:05.984
I know just the girl.

00:06.019 --> 00:07.778
I've got to get away
from my family, you know?

00:07.813 --> 00:09.900
It's a group of doctors
who go to third world countries.

00:09.935 --> 00:11.076
He wants me to go with him.

00:11.101 --> 00:12.509
I've written a note.

00:12.544 --> 00:14.742
It explains
why you want her to stay...

00:14.777 --> 00:17.055
and why you needed to leave
without saying good-bye.

00:17.090 --> 00:19.533
I'll bet there's a legal way
to get Miguel in the country.

00:19.568 --> 00:21.386
I get to rescue
the little Mexican boy,

00:21.421 --> 00:22.549
not you.

00:23.074 --> 00:25.209
And to think
you wanted me to wait.

00:25.731 --> 00:26.758
What?

00:27.312 --> 00:30.078
This is where Adrian used to
videotape Flora having sex.

00:30.367 --> 00:32.000
Marisol's real name is Suarez.

00:32.036 --> 00:34.563
She's the mother of the boy
that the police arrested.

00:34.598 --> 00:37.039
This woman...
She's trying to hurt me.

00:37.074 --> 00:38.361
Will I need a gun?

00:40.226 --> 00:42.249
Call 911! Now!

00:47.763 --> 00:48.633
What do we got?

00:48.668 --> 00:49.965
Female, early thirties,

00:50.000 --> 00:52.618
gunshot wound to the abdomen,
B.P. is 80 over 40.

00:52.653 --> 00:55.466
- Pulse?
- 120. Respiratory rate 12.

00:55.501 --> 00:56.671
Bay two. Get moving.

00:56.706 --> 00:58.441
Doctor! Doctor!

00:58.776 --> 01:01.627
I thought you should know my wife.
She's pregnant.

01:01.662 --> 01:03.442
We'll do what we can.

01:17.078 --> 01:19.223
I spoke to the doctor.

01:20.135 --> 01:21.621
Did he tell you?

01:22.166 --> 01:24.146
I am so sorry.

01:25.710 --> 01:28.011
I always wanted a little girl.

01:32.163 --> 01:34.535
- Michael, I hate to ask.
- Then don't.

01:34.570 --> 01:36.135
I need to know.

01:36.170 --> 01:38.194
Did Phillipe frame my son
for murderer?

01:38.229 --> 01:39.773
I won't discuss that.

01:39.808 --> 01:43.108
- Why are you still protecting him?
- I'm not. He will pay for this.

01:43.143 --> 01:46.128
But what about Flora?
If he's responsible for her death...

01:46.163 --> 01:48.244
Nothing I could tell you about that
can be used against him.

01:48.279 --> 01:50.295
Don't you get it?
It'd be throwing away my career,

01:50.346 --> 01:52.065
and you still wouldn't be able
to touch Phillipe!

01:52.100 --> 01:54.264
Michael?

01:55.153 --> 01:56.819
Hey.

01:58.146 --> 01:59.860
I thought you were sleeping.

01:59.995 --> 02:01.709
Tell her.

02:02.783 --> 02:04.154
What?

02:04.929 --> 02:08.268
Tell Marisol what she needs
to know.

02:08.695 --> 02:10.463
Honey, I'm his lawyer.

02:10.497 --> 02:12.709
I can lose my license
to practice.

02:13.750 --> 02:16.951
That man killed our baby.

02:28.506 --> 02:30.306
Where should I start?

02:31.237 --> 02:34.452
Tell me about the night
Flora Hernandez was murdered.

Odessa! Welcome home.

02:54.652 --> 02:56.503
It's so good to see you.

02:57.524 --> 02:58.969
How are you feeling?

02:58.973 --> 03:00.946
The doctors say she's made
a full recovery.

03:00.989 --> 03:03.014
Is it nice to be back?

03:03.049 --> 03:05.078
The house is filthy.

03:05.113 --> 03:07.206
You haven't gone inside yet.

03:07.316 --> 03:09.419
I can just tell.

03:14.889 --> 03:16.673
Oh, my God.

03:16.708 --> 03:19.676
- What do you call this?
- Chilaquiles. You like?

03:19.711 --> 03:20.794
Very much.

03:20.828 --> 03:23.764
You want more?
I've got plenty.

03:23.798 --> 03:26.183
Maybe just a little.

03:26.217 --> 03:28.719
You sure are spoiling me lately.

03:28.770 --> 03:30.771
Why shouldn't I?

03:30.805 --> 03:33.557
Everything you've done
for Miguel and me.

03:33.608 --> 03:35.005
My pleasure.

03:35.053 --> 03:36.934
He's such a nice boy.

03:37.178 --> 03:39.229
Oh, that's my phone.

03:39.280 --> 03:41.949
Sweetie, can you bring me
my telÃ©fono?

03:41.983 --> 03:43.951
Por favor?

03:47.121 --> 03:49.706
And he does
just what I tell him.

03:49.741 --> 03:51.708
I love that.

03:51.743 --> 03:52.993
Hi.

03:53.027 --> 03:54.544
Yeah, I'm on my way.

03:54.579 --> 03:56.830
What smells so good?

03:56.864 --> 04:00.133
Rosie made the most
delicious breakfast. Mwah!

04:00.168 --> 04:03.036
I'd have more,
but I gotta run.

04:05.840 --> 04:07.891
So...

04:09.260 --> 04:10.927
Can I have a plate of that?

04:15.083 --> 04:16.983
All gone.

04:17.017 --> 04:20.720
How many times can I say,
"I'm sorry"?

04:20.738 --> 04:22.773
- Never enough for what you did.
- I admit it.

04:22.824 --> 04:25.075
I tried to stop Peri
from bringing Miguel here,

04:25.109 --> 04:27.694
but only because I didn't want you
to feel you owed her something.

04:27.728 --> 04:30.247
Well, I do.
I owe her everything.

04:30.281 --> 04:32.582
Right! I knew it would be
better for our relationship

04:32.617 --> 04:33.784
if you owed me.

04:33.835 --> 04:35.168
What?!

04:35.203 --> 04:37.754
You know what I mean.

04:37.789 --> 04:39.339
I wanted to bring
Miguel here because

04:39.374 --> 04:41.875
I wanted to show you
how much I loved you.

04:41.909 --> 04:44.077
We've been together for months.

04:44.095 --> 04:46.880
And you never got him.

04:46.914 --> 04:49.249
Maybe you don't love me
as much as you think.

04:56.090 --> 04:57.808
Hey, guys!

04:57.859 --> 05:00.961
Good morning, Valentina.
It's so nice to see you.

05:00.995 --> 05:02.355
What are you doing here?

05:02.464 --> 05:03.864
I've been trying
to reach Remi all morning.

05:03.898 --> 05:05.866
He won't pick up.

05:05.900 --> 05:07.784
Oh, he's probably
just sleeping in.

05:07.819 --> 05:09.069
Go knock on his door.

05:09.103 --> 05:11.104
I want to show Valentina
my wedding dress.

05:15.827 --> 05:19.079
Pretty.

05:19.113 --> 05:20.747
But why such a thick veil?

05:20.781 --> 05:23.500
It'll be my fourth wedding
in this church.

05:23.551 --> 05:26.002
If the minister recognizes me,
I'm toast.

05:26.054 --> 05:27.304
Mm.

05:40.518 --> 05:42.936
- Okay. All right.
- Are you good?

05:42.970 --> 05:45.145
- Yes. Yes.
- While you get her settled,

05:45.264 --> 05:46.968
I'll take her suitcases
to her room, okay?

05:46.991 --> 05:48.158
- Thanks, baby.
- All right.

05:48.192 --> 05:50.694
- All right.
- Thank you.

05:50.745 --> 05:54.247
So... I guess
you and Sam are a couple.

05:54.282 --> 05:56.816
We're moving in together.

05:56.834 --> 05:57.951
Are you surprised?

05:57.985 --> 05:59.252
A little.

05:59.287 --> 06:01.788
I thought he had better taste.

06:01.822 --> 06:03.290
Well, you must be
feeling better

06:03.324 --> 06:05.175
if you're insulting me.

06:05.209 --> 06:07.043
Much better.

06:07.095 --> 06:09.129
If I didn't say so before...

06:09.163 --> 06:11.264
thank you for
everything you did.

06:11.299 --> 06:13.266
It's my pleasure.

06:13.301 --> 06:14.501
Alejandro wanted to be here,

06:14.519 --> 06:16.836
but he had a meeting
with his agents.

06:16.854 --> 06:18.855
To do damage control?

06:18.890 --> 06:20.307
So you heard about
the big news.

06:20.341 --> 06:22.058
I have.

06:22.110 --> 06:24.027
Did you know Alejandro was gay?

06:24.061 --> 06:26.029
Didn't have a clue.

06:26.063 --> 06:27.847
I wish I had.

06:27.865 --> 06:29.950
It would have
made things easier.

06:29.984 --> 06:31.034
Easier?

06:31.068 --> 06:34.738
This may shock you, but...

06:34.789 --> 06:38.291
Alejandro is not just
a friend to me.

06:38.326 --> 06:40.160
I have feelings for him.

06:40.194 --> 06:43.246
I'm not shocked.

06:43.297 --> 06:46.133
I kept thinking maybe one day
he would notice me,

06:46.167 --> 06:48.418
but... he never did.

06:48.469 --> 06:50.720
Now you know why.

06:50.755 --> 06:52.422
Honestly, it's a relief.

06:52.473 --> 06:53.974
If I can't have him,

06:54.008 --> 06:56.876
at least no other woman
will take my place.

06:58.262 --> 06:59.896
Are you ready for lunch?

06:59.931 --> 07:01.314
I made you paella.

07:01.349 --> 07:03.150
Mm. It's too spicy.

07:03.184 --> 07:05.185
You haven't tasted it yet.

07:05.219 --> 07:06.987
Mm. I can just tell.

07:10.024 --> 07:12.325
- I love this detail.
- I've never seen that.

07:12.360 --> 07:14.027
Remi's not in his room.

07:14.061 --> 07:16.246
He's not?

07:16.280 --> 07:19.566
All his things are gone.

07:19.584 --> 07:22.402
I found these notes
on his pillow.

07:22.420 --> 07:25.255
There's one for each of you.

07:28.109 --> 07:29.092
Oh, my God.

07:29.126 --> 07:30.961
What is it?

07:31.012 --> 07:33.847
He went to Africa.

07:33.881 --> 07:35.432
He left last night.

07:35.466 --> 07:40.220
He says he wants to help
vaccinate people in the Congo.

07:40.254 --> 07:43.089
Sounds like
the worst vacation ever.

07:43.107 --> 07:45.225
I don't think it's a vacation.

07:45.259 --> 07:46.776
Oh, my God. You're right.

07:46.811 --> 07:49.762
He says he'll be gone
for a whole year.

07:49.780 --> 07:51.531
Valentina,
did you know about this?

07:51.566 --> 07:53.783
He told her he wanted
to join doctors

07:53.818 --> 07:55.869
doing humanitarian work.

07:55.903 --> 07:58.271
Then he asked her
to go with him.

07:58.289 --> 08:00.440
Then why would he leave
without telling her?

08:00.458 --> 08:02.642
This doesn't sound like Remi.

08:02.677 --> 08:05.912
- I need to call him.
- He's not answering his phone.

08:05.946 --> 08:08.081
- Remember?
- Oh.

08:08.115 --> 08:11.134
Well, then I'll just leave
a message for him at his hotel.

08:11.168 --> 08:13.420
Is there a Mandarin Oriental
in the Congo?

08:13.454 --> 08:15.388
I don't know.

08:15.423 --> 08:17.007
I don't understand this.

08:17.058 --> 08:20.343
Africa of all places.

08:20.394 --> 08:21.895
If he wanted to help
poor people,

08:21.929 --> 08:24.431
why couldn't he just
go to Burbank?

08:28.352 --> 08:31.488
What does your note say?

08:34.575 --> 08:36.643
It doesn't matter.
Excuse me.

08:47.343 --> 08:49.561
Uh, next up...

08:49.612 --> 08:51.396
The Lamborghini.

08:51.447 --> 08:53.898
I want that.

08:53.949 --> 08:55.233
No, you don't.

08:55.284 --> 08:58.286
I do. I really do.

08:58.321 --> 09:00.121
It has a stick shift.

09:00.156 --> 09:02.891
- I'll hire a chauffeur.
- I said no.

09:02.925 --> 09:04.559
She gave you the Picasso.

09:04.593 --> 09:07.896
I just had the upholstery
redone... in mohair.

09:07.930 --> 09:09.998
The seats are so soft.

09:10.032 --> 09:11.433
- She's doing it out of spite.
- Okay. Okay.

09:11.467 --> 09:12.967
For God sakes, Evelyn.

09:13.002 --> 09:15.370
What would you ever do
with a Lamborghini?

09:15.388 --> 09:16.721
Well...

09:16.756 --> 09:18.556
I suppose I could have
my new chauffeur

09:18.591 --> 09:20.308
drive me to your house.

09:20.343 --> 09:22.394
And then once we were parked

09:22.428 --> 09:23.708
just beneath
your bedroom window,

09:23.712 --> 09:24.579
my new chauffeur and I
could make love

09:24.613 --> 09:27.349
on your mohair upholstery.

09:27.383 --> 09:29.317
Or if you feel that's spiteful,

09:29.352 --> 09:32.053
I-I really don't know
what to tell you.

09:33.689 --> 09:35.156
Excuse me.
Have you guys heard the news?

09:35.191 --> 09:37.025
We're in a meeting, Rickey.

09:37.059 --> 09:38.226
I'm so sorry, but...

09:38.244 --> 09:40.245
Michael Stappord's wife
was shot.

09:40.279 --> 09:41.855
- What?!
- Yeah, it's on the news.

09:41.940 --> 09:43.507
- She's in the hospital.
- Do they know who did it?

09:43.565 --> 09:45.233
No. It was like
a sniper or something.

09:45.251 --> 09:46.639
Oh, my God!

09:46.752 --> 09:48.909
- You know the Stappords, don't you?
- We do.

09:49.004 --> 09:50.505
And I hear Taylor
lost the baby.

09:50.539 --> 09:52.290
I didn't even know
she was pregnant.

09:52.341 --> 09:53.925
They had just found out.

09:53.959 --> 09:56.391
Well, we've got to send a card
or some flowers or something.

09:56.434 --> 09:57.859
I'll chip in
if you add my name to the card.

09:57.894 --> 10:00.598
Oh, absolutely.

10:00.633 --> 10:02.600
Now I got to tell Mr. Hemstead
what happened.

10:06.255 --> 10:08.423
Adrian?

10:10.617 --> 10:11.786
We're going home now.

10:11.821 --> 10:14.562
Uh...
Shall we reschedule?

10:14.596 --> 10:16.147
We'll call you later.

10:22.037 --> 10:24.289
In other news, a woman
is in critical condition

10:24.323 --> 10:26.441
after she was shot last night

10:26.459 --> 10:28.460
in front
of her Beverly Hills home.

10:28.494 --> 10:30.245
31-year-old Taylor Stappord

10:30.279 --> 10:33.214
suffered a single
gunshot wound to the abdomen.

10:33.249 --> 10:36.617
Police are calling the attack
"bizarre and unmotivated."

10:36.635 --> 10:38.052
A spokesman for the department

10:38.087 --> 10:40.221
says the suspect
is still at large.

10:40.256 --> 10:43.658
Wall Street is riding high
after yesterday's big rally...

10:43.692 --> 10:46.060
Well, if you do hear anything,

10:46.095 --> 10:48.663
please tell him
to call his mother.

10:48.697 --> 10:51.735
Thank you.

10:52.301 --> 10:54.769
I talked to all
of Remi's friends,

10:54.803 --> 10:56.438
and no one knew
what he had planned.

10:56.472 --> 10:59.140
Well, he's a grown man.
He'll be fine.

10:59.158 --> 11:02.076
But to just run off like that...
I don't understand it.

11:02.111 --> 11:04.112
I do.

11:04.146 --> 11:06.915
Yeah, there's something
to be said for...

11:06.949 --> 11:09.534
leaving your responsibilities
behind and...

11:09.585 --> 11:12.003
starting a new adventure.

11:12.037 --> 11:14.655
What are you thinking?

11:14.673 --> 11:17.258
Let's elope.

11:17.293 --> 11:19.177
What?

11:19.211 --> 11:23.515
I feel the need
to be alone with you

11:23.549 --> 11:27.018
in some exotic locale.

11:27.052 --> 11:29.437
That does sound romantic.

11:29.472 --> 11:30.672
When would we leave?

11:30.706 --> 11:33.308
Tonight.

11:33.342 --> 11:35.676
Well, now you're just
being silly.

11:35.694 --> 11:37.695
What about
our engagement party?

11:37.730 --> 11:39.614
Oh, that. Well...

11:39.648 --> 11:42.116
We could go after the party?

11:42.151 --> 11:45.253
Are you sure you don't want
to get married in Beverly Hills?

11:45.287 --> 11:48.039
It will affect the quality
of gifts we receive.

11:48.073 --> 11:49.357
We have each other.

11:49.391 --> 11:52.360
We don't care about
material things anymore.

11:52.378 --> 11:54.395
Oh.

11:54.430 --> 11:57.198
You'll have to remind me of that
from time to time.

11:57.216 --> 11:59.717
So you'll pack your bags?

11:59.752 --> 12:03.054
Of course.

12:05.407 --> 12:08.176
So... where do we want to go?

12:08.210 --> 12:10.311
I've always wanted
to visit Brunei.

12:10.346 --> 12:12.146
That's where
my business manager went.

12:12.181 --> 12:14.349
You know, the man
who stole all my money?

12:14.383 --> 12:16.317
- Really?
- Oh, yes.

12:16.352 --> 12:17.385
Apparently, we don't have

12:17.403 --> 12:19.604
an extradition treaty
with Brunei.

12:20.243 --> 12:23.023
You don't say. Hmm.

12:24.393 --> 12:26.611
Yeah, till she says no,
but she's not gonna say...

12:26.662 --> 12:28.780
You wanted to see me?

12:28.831 --> 12:31.032
Come in, Carmen.

12:31.066 --> 12:33.067
I want to introduce you
to my team.

12:33.085 --> 12:36.120
This is Roger, my publicist,
Max, my agent.

12:36.171 --> 12:38.739
And Gary is my...
my lawyer.

12:38.757 --> 12:41.626
Guys, this is Carmen...
my maid.

12:41.677 --> 12:44.512
Alejandro tell us
you're a very talented singer.

12:44.547 --> 12:46.581
That's nice of you.

12:46.599 --> 12:50.468
He also tell us
that you're very ambitions.

12:50.519 --> 12:52.720
Why would you tell them that?

12:52.754 --> 12:54.939
As you know,
Alejandro's private life

12:54.974 --> 12:57.559
has recently become grist
for the tabloid mill.

12:57.593 --> 12:59.777
- So?
- So...

12:59.812 --> 13:01.863
We have a proposition for you.

13:11.373 --> 13:14.775
As you can see, the contract
is rather straightforward.

13:14.793 --> 13:16.578
And this is all guaranteed.

13:16.612 --> 13:18.162
We will produce your album.

13:18.213 --> 13:20.214
And then you'll go on tour,
appear on talk shows...

13:20.249 --> 13:21.749
And, of course, you'll be paid.

13:21.783 --> 13:25.587
It's everything
you've ever wanted.

13:25.621 --> 13:28.473
If I pretend to be your wife.

13:28.507 --> 13:31.559
You will be his wife.
The ceremony will be legal.

13:31.594 --> 13:33.811
But it'll just be
for two years.

13:33.846 --> 13:35.813
And then you'll have
irreconcilable differences,

13:35.848 --> 13:37.649
and it'll all be over.

13:37.683 --> 13:41.269
You divorced your first husband
for the same reasons.

13:41.303 --> 13:43.354
No one will even think twice.

13:45.608 --> 13:48.276
- What about Sam?
- What about Sam?

13:48.310 --> 13:49.777
We're supposed
to move in together.

13:49.812 --> 13:52.363
Um... you won't be able
to date,

13:52.414 --> 13:54.782
not while you're married
to Alejandro.

13:54.816 --> 13:57.452
What if I saw him...
secretly?

13:57.486 --> 14:00.705
It's risky. The tabloids
are always watching.

14:00.756 --> 14:02.507
So you're asking me
to give him up?

14:02.541 --> 14:04.425
It's just for two years.

14:04.460 --> 14:07.679
And think of what
you're getting in return.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.470
This is a favor to me...

14:15.504 --> 14:18.640
obviously.

14:18.674 --> 14:20.975
And if you say "no,"

14:21.009 --> 14:22.443
we're cool.

14:22.478 --> 14:27.565
But if you do this,
people will hear you sing.

14:27.616 --> 14:30.985
You can finally share
your music with the world.

14:31.019 --> 14:32.820
So what do you say,
Carmen?

14:32.854 --> 14:36.207
Are you ready to be famous?

14:45.701 --> 14:46.834
Can I talk to you?

14:46.869 --> 14:48.503
I'm busy.

14:48.537 --> 14:50.505
Please.

14:50.539 --> 14:52.507
I have something important
I want to say.

14:52.541 --> 14:53.941
I know everything
that you will say,

14:53.976 --> 14:56.260
and none of it is important.

14:56.311 --> 14:57.812
You know that I want
to marry you.

14:57.846 --> 15:00.515
- And I have said "no."
- Rosie...

15:00.549 --> 15:02.817
It does not matter
how much you love me.

15:02.851 --> 15:05.319
I have to do the right thing,
and there is nothing you can say

15:05.354 --> 15:06.938
that will change my mind.

15:06.989 --> 15:09.724
And I also want
to adopt Miguel.

15:22.621 --> 15:23.955
Hola?

15:24.006 --> 15:26.090
Hey, Miguel.
It's Mrs. Westmore.

15:26.125 --> 15:28.376
I need to talk to your mother
about dinner tonight.

15:28.410 --> 15:31.512
Give the telÃ©fono
to your mamacita.

15:31.547 --> 15:33.581
Okay.

15:33.599 --> 15:35.216
Think of it.

15:35.250 --> 15:36.851
If you marry me
and I adopt Miguel,

15:36.885 --> 15:38.052
he'd be an American citizen

15:38.086 --> 15:39.804
and no one could ever
deport him.

15:39.855 --> 15:42.640
And we would be a family.

15:42.691 --> 15:44.776
Can you imagine
a more perfect life?

15:44.810 --> 15:47.445
It sounds wonderful.

15:47.479 --> 15:49.097
So?

15:52.434 --> 15:55.653
I cannot humiliate Mrs. Peri.

15:55.704 --> 15:59.290
But I would make you happy
for the rest of your life.

15:59.324 --> 16:02.577
There is a reason

16:02.611 --> 16:06.297
why they call it, um...

16:06.331 --> 16:09.784
"Doing the right thing."

16:09.802 --> 16:14.305
Because it is always
very hard to do.

16:16.508 --> 16:19.143
I understand.

16:26.852 --> 16:28.903
You're a good person.

16:28.937 --> 16:30.822
That's why I fell
in love with you.

16:30.856 --> 16:33.324
And you're a good man.

16:33.358 --> 16:37.612
That's why I love you.

16:37.646 --> 16:39.113
Mami?

16:42.584 --> 16:45.369
Mijo, you found my phone.

16:58.288 --> 16:59.622
Hey, hey.

16:59.656 --> 17:01.040
It's moving day.

17:02.492 --> 17:04.660
Let me guess.

17:04.694 --> 17:08.030
You haven't started
packing yet.

17:08.065 --> 17:09.698
That is so typical.
But...

17:09.715 --> 17:11.416
No worries.

17:11.468 --> 17:13.553
I will help you.

17:19.226 --> 17:22.144
What's with the velvet box?

17:22.179 --> 17:26.265
And if the first album
sells over 100,000 copies,

17:26.316 --> 17:27.883
the label
is contractually obligated

17:27.901 --> 17:29.986
to produce the second one.

17:30.020 --> 17:33.155
Of course, even if
the album is a huge hit,

17:33.190 --> 17:34.440
the marriage will be done
in two years.

17:34.491 --> 17:35.825
That's definite.

17:39.580 --> 17:43.366
So I guess what
I'm asking is...

17:43.400 --> 17:45.167
Are you willing to...
to wait for me?

17:49.739 --> 17:50.706
Sure.

17:50.740 --> 17:52.675
Really?!

17:52.709 --> 17:55.244
Of course.

17:55.262 --> 17:59.415
I'm more than happy to put
my life on hold for two years

17:59.433 --> 18:02.602
while you enter into a fake
marriage with a celebrity.

18:02.636 --> 18:04.804
I mean what guy
wouldn't agree to that?

18:04.855 --> 18:06.422
- Okay, hold on...
- But I suppose

18:06.440 --> 18:09.425
the men with at least
a molecule of self-respect

18:09.443 --> 18:10.810
might have an issue with this.

18:10.861 --> 18:12.061
But we both know
that I'm a loser

18:12.095 --> 18:13.095
and I'll agree to anything.
Right?

18:13.113 --> 18:14.597
- Sam, you're not a loser.
- Oh.

18:14.631 --> 18:16.115
Well, in that case...

18:16.149 --> 18:18.651
I know.
I know it's a lot to ask,

18:18.702 --> 18:21.137
but these people are offering me
everything I've ever wanted!

18:21.171 --> 18:23.205
I thought I was what
you wanted!

18:23.240 --> 18:25.408
- Well, you are, of course.
- You just said that two days ago.

18:25.442 --> 18:26.742
You want me...

18:26.776 --> 18:29.128
More than a career,
more than success.

18:31.615 --> 18:34.383
Which is it, Carmen?

18:37.504 --> 18:39.288
I want it all.

18:39.306 --> 18:41.724
You can't have it all.

18:41.758 --> 18:43.476
You're gonna have to choose.

19:00.310 --> 19:02.745
Sam. Come here.

19:02.779 --> 19:05.647
Sam, Sam!

19:05.666 --> 19:07.483
Sam, please!

19:07.501 --> 19:09.418
Sam, wait!

19:09.453 --> 19:11.587
Wait!

19:11.621 --> 19:13.706
Sam, let's talk about this.

19:15.042 --> 19:16.258
Why do you have
to go that far?!

19:16.293 --> 19:17.510
It doesn't make any sense!

19:17.544 --> 19:19.295
It... it is for my career.

19:21.548 --> 19:23.349
Odessa, Odessa,
it's already final.

19:23.383 --> 19:26.686
- I don't understand!
- Stop it!

19:29.890 --> 19:31.941
What is going on?

19:36.530 --> 19:37.646
I told Odessa we were
getting married,

19:37.680 --> 19:39.699
and she freaked out.

19:39.733 --> 19:41.617
I don't know what's going on.

19:48.759 --> 19:50.693
Listen, I...

19:58.719 --> 20:00.219
Uvas.

20:00.253 --> 20:01.971
Mango.

20:02.005 --> 20:03.205
So...

20:03.240 --> 20:05.374
Do you want some new outfits?

20:05.392 --> 20:08.978
I thought we could
go shopping later.

20:12.566 --> 20:16.235
Honey...

20:16.269 --> 20:18.854
I know you're sad about Remi.

20:18.888 --> 20:21.023
But he'll be back.

20:21.057 --> 20:23.526
And you'll pick up
where you left off.

20:23.560 --> 20:24.777
Why would you think that?

20:24.828 --> 20:28.397
Because... he adores you.

20:28.415 --> 20:30.583
I don't think he does.

20:30.617 --> 20:32.734
You're wrong.

20:32.753 --> 20:36.071
It's like you said.

20:36.089 --> 20:39.708
Why would a boy like Remi
love me?

20:39.742 --> 20:41.510
I'm nothing.

20:45.849 --> 20:49.885
Remi loves you very much.

20:49.919 --> 20:51.604
I know this.

20:51.638 --> 20:54.473
How?

20:57.611 --> 21:01.063
Because I saw
the look on his face

21:01.097 --> 21:04.533
when I asked him
to write you that note.

21:04.568 --> 21:06.786
What?

21:09.606 --> 21:11.407
It was me.

21:11.441 --> 21:13.993
I begged him to go without you.

21:14.044 --> 21:16.662
He didn't want to go.

21:16.713 --> 21:18.947
Oh, my God.

21:18.965 --> 21:22.751
- I'm so... I'm so sorry.
- Oh, my God.

21:22.785 --> 21:24.720
Sweetheart! Wait. No! Wait!

21:24.754 --> 21:28.674
Wait! Wait! I was only
trying to protect you.

21:28.725 --> 21:30.009
Don't touch me!

22:06.651 --> 22:08.769
- Marisol!
- Hey.

22:08.803 --> 22:10.104
We got your text.

22:10.138 --> 22:11.305
We're in absolute shock.

22:11.356 --> 22:12.473
How is Taylor?

22:12.524 --> 22:14.641
- She's gonna be okay.
- Thank God.

22:14.693 --> 22:15.893
- Did you see what happened?
- I was inside the house.

22:15.927 --> 22:17.695
So this was an accident, right?

22:17.729 --> 22:19.772
Why would anybody want
to shoot Taylor Stappord?

22:19.817 --> 22:22.968
Actually... I think they were trying
to shoot me.

22:23.368 --> 22:24.535
Are you kidding?

22:24.569 --> 22:26.070
No.

22:26.104 --> 22:27.538
Why would anybody want
to shoot you?

22:27.572 --> 22:30.541
Because of what I know,
what I've learned.

22:30.575 --> 22:32.543
What are you talking about?

22:37.248 --> 22:39.449
My real name...

22:39.467 --> 22:42.619
is Marisol Suarez.

22:42.637 --> 22:44.388
And I'm not a maid.

22:44.422 --> 22:45.806
But you work for the Stappords.

22:45.840 --> 22:48.092
I've seen you
take out their trash.

22:48.126 --> 22:50.511
Actually,
I'm a college professor.

22:50.562 --> 22:53.330
And I only took this job
to become friends with all of you.

22:53.365 --> 22:54.898
Why?

22:54.933 --> 22:57.818
So I could learn everything
you knew about Flora Hernandez.

22:57.852 --> 23:00.270
That boy that killed Flora?

23:00.304 --> 23:03.407
- His name was Suarez.
- Yes, Eddie is my son.

23:03.441 --> 23:06.660
But he didn't kill nobody.
He was framed.

23:06.694 --> 23:08.245
You knew about this?

23:11.616 --> 23:13.534
Oh, oh, no. No.

23:13.585 --> 23:15.002
I have evidence.

23:15.036 --> 23:16.453
That's what I've been doing
for the past weeks...

23:16.487 --> 23:17.788
learning about Flora's life.

23:17.822 --> 23:18.789
And lying to us.

23:18.823 --> 23:20.507
Guys, come on.

23:20.542 --> 23:23.544
So if your son didn't
kill Flora Hernandez, who did?

23:23.595 --> 23:26.502
I think it was Phillipe Delatour.

23:27.715 --> 23:30.634
But I'm gonna need help
from all of you

23:30.668 --> 23:32.269
to prove it.

23:38.009 --> 23:40.611
The caterers should be
doing that.

23:40.645 --> 23:42.529
Oh, it's all right.
I need to keep busy.

23:42.564 --> 23:45.783
If you need any help...

23:45.817 --> 23:48.819
I won't. But thank you.

23:48.853 --> 23:50.404
Anybody home?!

23:50.455 --> 23:52.406
Ah!

23:52.457 --> 23:53.957
The man of the hour.

23:53.992 --> 23:56.293
Your housekeeper told me
I'd find you both back here.

23:56.327 --> 23:58.212
Shouldn't you be at home
getting ready for the party?

23:58.246 --> 23:59.746
I'll just be here for a moment.

23:59.798 --> 24:01.381
I have a little favor to ask.

24:01.416 --> 24:02.916
Oh?

24:02.967 --> 24:05.135
As soon as the party is over,
I want to take Genevieve

24:05.170 --> 24:08.255
out of town
for a romantic getaway.

24:08.306 --> 24:10.207
That sounds lovely.
How can we help?

24:10.241 --> 24:13.310
I was wondering
if I could borrow your jet.

24:16.881 --> 24:18.899
Obviously I'd pay for the fuel.

24:18.933 --> 24:22.853
We don't really loan the jet.

24:22.887 --> 24:24.905
Well, I could pay you,
you know, whatever you need.

24:24.939 --> 24:26.389
Then you could lease a plane.

24:26.407 --> 24:27.524
Uh, it's such short notice.

24:27.558 --> 24:28.525
Or fly commercial.

24:28.559 --> 24:29.943
No, it has to be private.

24:31.729 --> 24:34.281
Something happened?

24:34.332 --> 24:37.367
Not at all.

24:37.401 --> 24:41.171
Uh, just trying to do
something nice for Genevieve.

24:41.206 --> 24:45.008
Well, as... as much as
we would like to help,

24:45.043 --> 24:47.344
Oh, there's no need
to apologize.

24:47.378 --> 24:48.712
You're throwing us
an engagement party,

24:48.746 --> 24:50.797
for heaven's sake.

24:50.849 --> 24:53.467
So we'll, uh,
see you at 7:00?

24:53.518 --> 24:55.052
Okay.

24:55.086 --> 24:57.754
I'm so glad you ordered
dahlias again.

24:57.772 --> 24:59.523
They're my favorite.

24:59.557 --> 25:01.308
Again?

25:01.359 --> 25:04.778
Don't you use them
at all your parties?

25:04.812 --> 25:09.366
I've only used dahlias
once before, actually...

25:09.400 --> 25:11.568
The night our maid
was murdered.

25:11.602 --> 25:14.655
Well...

25:14.706 --> 25:16.540
I didn't go to that party.

25:16.574 --> 25:20.377
So... you must have
used them before.

25:20.411 --> 25:23.130
Perhaps.

25:24.916 --> 25:27.050
Okay.
I'll see you tonight.

25:29.971 --> 25:31.889
What a liar.

25:31.923 --> 25:35.125
He's not interested
in a romantic getaway.

25:35.159 --> 25:37.010
He needs to leave town
for some reason.

25:37.061 --> 25:38.845
That's not all he lied about.

25:38.897 --> 25:41.815
He was here
the night Flora was killed.

25:41.849 --> 25:42.816
What?

25:42.850 --> 25:45.068
I saw him...

25:45.103 --> 25:47.237
- in the hallway.
- Well, that was months ago.

25:47.272 --> 25:48.772
How can you remember
something like that?

25:48.806 --> 25:50.691
Because I didn't invite him.
He and Genevieve were...

25:50.742 --> 25:53.360
were not on speaking terms.
I was so annoyed.

25:53.411 --> 25:55.629
Why would Phillipe lie
about something like that?

25:55.704 --> 25:57.378
I don't know.

25:57.413 --> 26:00.417
Unless...

26:00.451 --> 26:01.952
What?

26:01.986 --> 26:06.340
Did you ever involve Phillipe
in your disgusting little hobby?

26:08.676 --> 26:12.296
Oh, my God.

26:12.330 --> 26:15.682
- I say we go to the cops.
- We can't.

26:15.717 --> 26:17.384
But Phillipe confessed.

26:17.435 --> 26:18.852
To Michael Stappord...

26:18.886 --> 26:21.004
His lawyer.
Nothing Phillipe says to him

26:21.022 --> 26:22.973
can be used against him
in a court of law.

26:23.007 --> 26:24.141
Well, I have to tell Genevieve.

26:24.175 --> 26:26.059
I can't let her marry
a murderer.

26:26.110 --> 26:28.028
If Phillipe knows
we're on to him,

26:28.062 --> 26:30.513
he will leave town,
and my son will stay in jail.

26:30.531 --> 26:31.732
No.

26:31.783 --> 26:35.018
We have to keep quiet
until I have absolute proof.

26:35.036 --> 26:36.737
But how are we gonna do that?

26:36.788 --> 26:40.324
Tonight is the Delatours'
engagement party, right?

26:40.358 --> 26:42.909
Yeah.
It's at the Powells' house.

26:42.961 --> 26:44.661
Call Genevieve.

26:44.695 --> 26:46.580
Tell her you're worried
that the caterers

26:46.631 --> 26:48.715
haven't hired enough people
for the party.

26:48.750 --> 26:52.702
Luckily, you have a few friends
who are willing to help out.

26:57.875 --> 27:00.761
He had no right!

27:00.812 --> 27:02.062
None whatsoever.

27:02.096 --> 27:04.848
She was mine.
Flora belonged to me.

27:04.882 --> 27:07.184
And Phillipe took her from you.

27:07.218 --> 27:09.987
She told me
she had been attacked,

27:10.021 --> 27:11.721
but I didn't believe her.

27:11.739 --> 27:13.523
How could you?
She was a liar.

27:13.557 --> 27:16.360
She also showed me a tape
of a meeting with Michael.

27:16.394 --> 27:19.162
How he offered her money.
She seemed so...

27:19.197 --> 27:21.698
calculating, so manipulative...

27:21.732 --> 27:25.419
She was manipulative.
That's what got her killed.

27:27.071 --> 27:28.505
I hate Phillipe.

27:32.010 --> 27:34.878
I want him to suffer
for what he's done.

27:34.912 --> 27:36.630
Is that wrong of me?

27:38.249 --> 27:40.934
Evil is the thing that
takes away the people we love.

27:40.968 --> 27:43.887
It took our son.

27:43.921 --> 27:46.189
And it took Flora.

27:46.224 --> 27:50.060
No. It is never wrong
to punish evil.

27:50.094 --> 27:52.138
I want to be careful.
I don't want to get caught.

27:52.194 --> 27:55.341
Don't worry.
I'll help you.

27:59.603 --> 28:01.104
You would be willing
to do this?

28:03.041 --> 28:05.492
This morning you wanted
to divorce me.

28:05.543 --> 28:09.796
Love can't seem to unite us.

28:09.831 --> 28:12.299
Why not try hatred?

28:20.768 --> 28:22.102
Valentina?

28:24.572 --> 28:27.541
I know you're in there.
Please let me in.

28:27.575 --> 28:30.043
Listen, I have to leave
for the party now.

28:30.078 --> 28:31.945
But when I get home,
we'll talk about what I've done,

28:31.963 --> 28:36.550
and then... I will beg
for your forgiveness.

28:36.584 --> 28:39.136
And I hope with all my heart
you will give it to me.

28:39.170 --> 28:41.221
Okay?

28:51.132 --> 28:53.133
We agree.

28:53.151 --> 28:55.602
- Hey.
- Oh.

29:04.996 --> 29:07.280
So... what do you think?

29:07.314 --> 29:09.750
Everything
is absolutely exquisite.

29:09.784 --> 29:12.536
I think it's going to be
a memorable evening.

29:12.587 --> 29:15.756
You have no idea.

29:17.658 --> 29:19.229
Zoila!

29:19.577 --> 29:20.961
You look stunning!

29:20.995 --> 29:22.763
Well, look at you.

29:22.797 --> 29:24.798
Doesn't she look stunning?

29:24.832 --> 29:26.833
Yes, she does.
She really does.

29:26.851 --> 29:28.335
Thank you, Phillipe.

29:29.250 --> 29:32.574
Oh, you made it.

29:55.880 --> 29:57.631
- Hors d'oeuvre?
- Thank you.

30:01.219 --> 30:03.036
Evelyn.

30:03.054 --> 30:04.638
What are you doing here?

30:04.672 --> 30:07.040
I was... asked
to work the party.

30:07.058 --> 30:08.642
By whom?

30:08.676 --> 30:10.761
Uh...

30:10.812 --> 30:12.345
It doesn't matter.
You have to leave.

30:12.380 --> 30:14.181
Security!

30:14.215 --> 30:16.066
Listen...

30:20.238 --> 30:22.105
Excuse me.

30:22.156 --> 30:23.657
- We have to do it now.
- Already?

30:23.691 --> 30:25.725
Evelyn's seen me.
We don't have much time.

30:25.743 --> 30:28.745
I'll tell the girls.

30:28.780 --> 30:32.532
And a C.E.O. Phillipe knows
is lending us his private jet.

30:32.566 --> 30:34.201
We leave tonight
after the party.

30:34.235 --> 30:36.837
Mm. Brunei sounds like fun.

30:36.871 --> 30:40.073
Phillipe was joking we may not
come back for years.

30:42.627 --> 30:44.711
Later, when you have a moment,
come find me.

30:44.745 --> 30:46.179
I have a gift for you.

30:46.214 --> 30:48.849
You and Evelyn have done
too much for us as it is.

30:48.883 --> 30:51.718
Well, this gift
is just from me, and...

30:51.752 --> 30:53.603
it's only for you.

30:55.423 --> 30:57.691
Mr. Delatour?
People are asking

30:57.725 --> 30:59.776
if you'd like
to say something to the crowd.

30:59.811 --> 31:03.230
That'd be great.
I'd love to say a few words.

31:03.264 --> 31:04.865
We thought you might.

31:09.757 --> 31:12.322
If I could have
everyone's attention, please,

31:12.373 --> 31:15.158
I think it's time to hear
from our guests of honor...

31:15.209 --> 31:17.828
the Delatours!

31:19.964 --> 31:22.883
Thank you. Thank you.

31:22.917 --> 31:25.118
So...

31:25.153 --> 31:27.637
Genevieve and I
are getting married.

31:27.672 --> 31:29.756
- Again.
- It is a miracle to me

31:29.790 --> 31:33.226
that this amazing woman
is giving me a second chance.

31:33.261 --> 31:35.395
But I'm a changed man.

31:35.429 --> 31:39.733
And I'm gonna do
everything I can to...

31:43.304 --> 31:46.156
To make her happy.

31:46.190 --> 31:50.026
And he's off to
a good start.

31:50.077 --> 31:52.812
Have you seen the ring?

31:52.830 --> 31:56.116
Thank you all so much
for coming this evening.

32:00.922 --> 32:03.957
I just want to tell you
how happy I am for you.

32:03.991 --> 32:08.795
And I am ready to give
you and Phillipe my blessing.

32:08.829 --> 32:11.097
- Oh, Zoila!
- Oh!

32:12.266 --> 32:14.667
Oh...

32:16.354 --> 32:17.888
Oh, my God!
I'm so sorry!

32:17.939 --> 32:20.407
We need to get some water on this
before it sets.

32:20.441 --> 32:22.058
I'll be right back.

32:22.109 --> 32:25.695
Come on, come on,
let's get this dry.

32:39.544 --> 32:40.377
So what does this woman
look like?

32:40.411 --> 32:43.079
She's 5'6", 120 pounds, and...

32:43.130 --> 32:46.199
vaguely ethnic.

33:21.369 --> 33:23.003
Do you know who I am?

33:23.037 --> 33:25.455
Oh, yes.

33:25.506 --> 33:28.258
Do you know who I am?

33:28.292 --> 33:32.095
You're the mother of the boy
who killed that maid.

33:32.129 --> 33:36.600
Her name was Flora Hernandez,
and my son didn't kill anyone.

33:38.352 --> 33:40.253
Ah, yes, well...

33:40.271 --> 33:41.688
I hear you've been asking

33:41.722 --> 33:43.256
some unpleasant questions
about me.

33:45.026 --> 33:47.310
And I've been getting
some interesting answers.

33:47.361 --> 33:49.396
From whom?

33:49.430 --> 33:51.781
Michael Stappord.

33:54.235 --> 33:55.902
He's my lawyer.

33:55.936 --> 33:57.237
He can't talk about me.

33:57.271 --> 33:59.939
And yet... he did.

34:03.044 --> 34:04.628
He told me about Adrian

34:04.662 --> 34:08.047
arranging for you
to sleep with Flora.

34:08.081 --> 34:10.833
But when she found out
you were Remi's father,

34:10.885 --> 34:14.554
she refused... because she was
dating your son.

34:14.588 --> 34:16.789
But you're not the kind of man

34:16.806 --> 34:19.092
who likes to take "no"
for an answer.

34:21.178 --> 34:25.532
Weeks later, you found out
she was carrying Remi's child,

34:25.565 --> 34:30.170
and she was demanding millions
to keep it quiet.

34:30.204 --> 34:31.821
So you came here...

34:31.856 --> 34:34.991
to a party
you weren't invited to.

34:35.025 --> 34:38.995
The waiters thought you were
just another guest in a tux.

34:39.030 --> 34:41.150
That's why they didn't notice
when you took the knife.

34:42.649 --> 34:47.286
You then went looking
for Flora.

34:47.321 --> 34:49.121
And you found her.

34:50.524 --> 34:52.592
Even though you had
stabbed her,

34:52.626 --> 34:54.793
somehow Flora managed
to get away.

34:54.828 --> 34:57.330
But before you could
follow her,

34:57.348 --> 34:59.015
my son walked in...

34:59.050 --> 35:01.000
At the wrong moment.

35:01.018 --> 35:03.853
so you hit him.

35:05.672 --> 35:09.442
And put the knife in his hand.

35:09.477 --> 35:15.248
And my son was blamed for
the death of a girl he loved.

35:16.951 --> 35:18.401
I stabbed her...

35:18.452 --> 35:21.154
The next day,
you told Michael what happened,

35:21.188 --> 35:23.039
and he kept your secret.

35:27.078 --> 35:31.381
Until the bullet
you intended for me...

35:31.415 --> 35:34.884
killed his unborn child.

35:36.887 --> 35:40.256
These are pathetic... lies.

35:40.307 --> 35:42.342
I have evidence,

35:42.376 --> 35:44.978
and I'm going to the D.A.
tomorrow.

35:49.183 --> 35:51.985
Come on. Say something.

36:00.394 --> 36:01.611
Then why tell me?

36:01.662 --> 36:05.448
What?

36:05.499 --> 36:08.701
If I'm so dangerous,

36:08.735 --> 36:11.371
why would you be here
with me?

36:11.405 --> 36:15.508
Do you want money?
Is that it?

36:15.543 --> 36:18.211
No.

36:18.245 --> 36:21.181
I just wanted to see your face,

36:21.215 --> 36:23.713
to see if you could
appreciate the irony.

36:23.748 --> 36:25.770
Irony?

36:26.437 --> 36:29.556
You took the life of a maid,

36:29.590 --> 36:33.631
and now a maid
is going to take yours.

36:33.666 --> 36:37.063
I don't think so.

36:40.151 --> 36:42.535
There she is!

36:42.570 --> 36:44.537
Sorry, ma'am...

36:44.572 --> 36:48.124
but you're gonna have
to come with me.

36:51.378 --> 36:54.914
I am so sorry.

36:54.948 --> 36:57.083
I hope she wasn't
bothering you?

36:57.117 --> 36:59.719
Uh, not at all.

37:08.729 --> 37:12.465
Zoila, I have to find Phillipe!

37:12.483 --> 37:13.933
Please stop dabbing me.

37:13.968 --> 37:16.486
You have...
There's still a little left.

37:17.571 --> 37:19.572
Hey, look over there.

37:28.332 --> 37:30.250
There he is.

37:30.284 --> 37:32.085
Adrian.

37:32.119 --> 37:34.787
Listen, uh...

37:34.821 --> 37:37.156
Genevieve and I
will have to be going.

37:37.174 --> 37:38.341
Not so fast.

37:38.375 --> 37:39.709
I have a gift for you.

37:39.760 --> 37:41.961
- Remember?
- I really don't have the time.

37:41.995 --> 37:43.796
We've got a jet waiting for us.

37:43.830 --> 37:49.502
Don't be rude. I put a lot
of thought into this gift.

37:53.774 --> 37:57.861
Nothing on that tape
comes close to a confession.

37:57.895 --> 38:00.313
How am I ever gonna get Eddie
out of jail?

38:04.401 --> 38:07.520
So...

38:07.538 --> 38:09.689
Where is this gift?

38:13.244 --> 38:17.830
Actually, what I have to offer
comes in the form of advice.

38:17.864 --> 38:20.633
Adrian, I told you we...

38:20.668 --> 38:22.467
Is there something wrong?

38:25.172 --> 38:27.140
Just, I don't feel so good.

38:32.229 --> 38:34.397
My advice is this...

38:34.431 --> 38:37.267
The trick to getting away
with murder is not to let people

38:37.318 --> 38:39.152
think it was murder
in the first place.

38:39.186 --> 38:41.070
What?

38:41.105 --> 38:43.573
You must create
a plausible explanation

38:43.607 --> 38:45.224
for an unexpected death.

38:46.727 --> 38:49.112
Such as suicide.

38:53.567 --> 38:56.085
What...
What did you do?

38:56.120 --> 38:57.253
Not much is needed.

38:57.288 --> 38:59.472
Something undetectable
in a glass...

38:59.506 --> 39:01.174
to relax the muscles.

39:02.676 --> 39:06.095
And a witness
to the victim's last words.

39:08.882 --> 39:12.385
Uh, I don't understand.

39:13.687 --> 39:16.922
You killed my maid,
you son of a bitch.

39:16.941 --> 39:20.359
Don't you know how hard it is
to find good help?

39:23.731 --> 39:26.282
Has anybody seen Phillipe?

39:31.372 --> 39:33.623
Aah!

40:02.486 --> 40:04.136
And then he shouted
something to the effect

40:04.154 --> 40:06.739
that he had murdered
Flora Hernandez

40:06.774 --> 40:08.574
and couldn't live
with himself anymore.

40:08.609 --> 40:10.476
And then
he jumped out the window.

40:10.494 --> 40:12.695
We were absolutely stunned.

40:12.746 --> 40:14.197
It was just
the two of you in the room?

40:14.248 --> 40:17.817
There were no other witnesses
to this proclamation?

40:17.835 --> 40:19.335
What are you getting at?

40:19.370 --> 40:21.153
Well, according
to your party guests,

40:21.171 --> 40:23.373
he was only in the water
for a minute.

40:23.424 --> 40:26.492
But when they pulled him out,
he was already dead.

40:26.510 --> 40:27.510
That's odd.

40:29.496 --> 40:31.047
Uh, we heard it, too.

40:31.098 --> 40:34.217
We were in the hall
outside that room...

40:34.268 --> 40:36.335
Picking up napkins
and... and glasses.

40:36.353 --> 40:37.603
I was looking for a bathroom.

40:37.638 --> 40:40.273
And we all heard a man yell,

40:40.307 --> 40:41.891
"I killed Flora Hernandez."

40:41.942 --> 40:44.343
And then there was a splash.

40:47.981 --> 40:49.866
Go call the D.A.

40:49.900 --> 40:52.201
He's gonna want
to know about this.
