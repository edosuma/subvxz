00:09.468 --> 00:12.893
"Supreme Court"

00:16.975 --> 00:18.773
Kazuya Soga, get out here!

00:18.894 --> 00:21.238
<i>- Griffin Unit, ten minutes to air-strike.
- Eagle clear.</i>

00:21.355 --> 00:23.073
- <i>Griffin Unit,</i>
- <i>Fox negative.</i>

00:23.232 --> 00:25.860
- <i>ten minutes to air-strike. Griffin Unit,</i>
- <i>Griffin here. Roger that'.</i>

00:25.984 --> 00:28.658
- <i>ten minutes to air-strike.</i>
- <i>It's clear!</i>

00:39.706 --> 00:42.710
<i>- Tossing hand grenade.
- Wait! They've got hostages.</i>

00:42.709 --> 00:44.211
<i>Request support!</i>

01:06.108 --> 01:11.285
We hereby issue the final verdict
on defendant Kazuya Soga.

01:14.783 --> 01:19.630
It is evident that the defendant
committed crimes against humanity

01:19.705 --> 01:21.457
during the fighting in Qhardistan.

01:24.209 --> 01:30.808
Therefore, this war crimes court
hereby sentences...

03:20.075 --> 03:24.455
Strange... Why am I awake when
everyone else is sleep-learning?

03:24.454 --> 03:27.253
Lend me that clever little brain of yours.

03:31.712 --> 03:34.215
Who are you?

03:37.134 --> 03:41.389
Who is that updating my synchronization?

03:41.388 --> 03:43.482
You and me...?

03:43.473 --> 03:44.975
Huh?

03:44.975 --> 03:48.605
<i>We're doing this to clear our
names and Colonel Saga 's!</i>

03:48.603 --> 03:50.446
<i>Get the module into the vehicle!</i>

04:01.908 --> 04:03.535
It's a secret.

04:11.251 --> 04:15.802
Last night, all of Public Security's systems
went down for just 1.8 seconds.

04:16.839 --> 04:19.810
Mistake? Error? Hacking?

04:19.801 --> 04:21.644
We're investigating.

04:21.636 --> 04:26.767
But there's a possibility that this one
Logicoma synched with something.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.019
"Something"?

04:28.018 --> 04:32.740
I want you to find out what--and how
it's related to the system going down.

04:34.608 --> 04:39.489
What freak would bother accessing
an Al with an outdated neurochip,

04:39.654 --> 04:42.624
not to mention a conveyer
that can only walk and talk?

04:42.616 --> 04:47.463
In any case, we're leaving the
others off and isolating this one.

04:47.454 --> 04:49.172
I'd like you to investigate it, too.

04:49.790 --> 04:52.669
In other words, you're worried
it was an inside job.

04:53.335 --> 04:55.679
All right, I'll use a civilian facility.

04:55.670 --> 04:59.675
I would have liked to go to an
independent squad with this...

04:59.758 --> 05:02.557
Still looking for the perfect personnel?

05:02.552 --> 05:05.522
It is my team. I intend to take care.

05:06.223 --> 05:09.568
People can get addicted to
the carefree consultant life.

05:09.559 --> 05:14.315
Or are you waiting to form it until
it's a higher priority for the brass?

05:14.981 --> 05:19.703
If you want the squad to last,
don't get overly ambitious.

05:26.576 --> 05:29.295
<i>Your parallel commands are randomized?</i>

05:31.665 --> 05:32.632
<i>Is there a point to that?</i>

05:32.707 --> 05:35.802
<i>It's best for our learning.</i>

05:39.172 --> 05:41.345
It's outside my system standards.

05:41.341 --> 05:44.936
Can you explain the data you received verbally?

05:44.928 --> 05:49.434
Um, I feel like it was
something really important...

05:49.432 --> 05:51.855
I see it was completely integrated.

05:51.852 --> 05:55.777
Whoever did this, they're good.

05:55.772 --> 05:57.445
I feel sort of fluttery.

05:57.774 --> 06:00.197
There's no record of the infiltrator.

06:00.318 --> 06:01.991
Not only were you fully integrated,

06:02.112 --> 06:05.457
you got yourself bitten by false memories too.

06:05.448 --> 06:07.416
I got bitten?!

06:09.286 --> 06:11.584
Precious experience points!

06:18.253 --> 06:19.675
Bingo.

06:19.754 --> 06:23.600
Wow, that was inside me?! I'm amazing!

06:23.717 --> 06:27.438
Yeah, yeah. They really are good.

06:28.054 --> 06:29.601
<i>I'm saying that for a soldier,</i>

06:29.764 --> 06:32.483
<i>killing your own countrymen
is as low as you can sink!</i>

06:32.475 --> 06:33.852
What's this?

06:33.935 --> 06:37.439
<i>We're doing it to prove
our innocence, and the colonel's!</i>

06:37.606 --> 06:38.607
<i>Just get the module--</i>

06:57.292 --> 06:59.044
A traffic control error?

07:02.464 --> 07:04.307
What, what, what?!

07:05.508 --> 07:07.055
Logicoma!

07:09.137 --> 07:10.639
Sheesh!

07:21.608 --> 07:22.825
Why is everyone suddenly crazy'?!

08:40.937 --> 08:42.905
Motoko Kusanagi...

08:42.981 --> 08:46.235
<i>Kusanagi? The major with the 501?</i>

08:46.317 --> 08:48.911
<i>Pretty sure she's independent now.</i>

08:48.987 --> 08:51.035
<i>Call in all deployed
personnel as reinforcements.</i>

08:53.158 --> 08:54.626
An assault?

08:54.617 --> 08:56.665
<i>It's raining military-grade bullets.</i>

08:56.745 --> 08:59.089
<i>They took advantage of a traffic control error.</i>

08:59.080 --> 09:03.506
<i>Assuming you aren't
setting me up, send backup.</i>

09:03.585 --> 09:08.307
<i>The attackers are battle cyborgs.
One of them is Batou, the sleepless eye.</i>

09:08.298 --> 09:09.299
<i>What?!</i>

09:09.299 --> 09:13.520
<i>I found a strange code in the data
planted in the Logicoma's AI.</i>

09:14.596 --> 09:16.940
So that's their objective.

09:17.015 --> 09:20.645
<i>Put the Logicoma in self-defense mode.
I'll have backup there in fifteen minutes.</i>

09:20.643 --> 09:21.439
<i>Fifteen?!</i>

09:22.145 --> 09:25.649
The traffic network is being taken over.

09:25.648 --> 09:26.399
Report.

09:26.775 --> 09:29.745
Domination expanding throughout the city.

09:33.114 --> 09:35.208
Well, hurry up and stop it!

09:35.283 --> 09:37.285
We don't have enough processing speed.

09:38.953 --> 09:39.954
Huh?

09:39.954 --> 09:43.128
Penetration increasing.
Defensive advance ineffective.

09:50.298 --> 09:51.470
Locking down the airport now.

09:51.466 --> 09:54.140
- We have a malfunction in the new control system, cause unknown.
- Divert all flights to surrounding airports.

09:54.219 --> 09:56.017
- Flight A885, the airport is
- Send those with extra fuel furthest away.

09:56.012 --> 09:58.060
- Shut down due to a crash.
- Tell Tokyo Control to return all landing planes to...

09:58.139 --> 10:02.565
Both air-traffic control and the new
street traffic system are affected.

10:02.644 --> 10:07.320
80% of the street system has been
taken over by an outside operator.

10:11.319 --> 10:15.825
This is crazy--what enormous
system is our hacker using'?!

10:16.825 --> 10:19.419
Major, fifteen minutes will be a problem.

10:19.494 --> 10:20.871
<i>You're joking!</i>

10:20.870 --> 10:23.999
This isn't an error. It's a crime.

10:28.837 --> 10:32.842
Large-scale domination?!
Who has a system like that?!

10:42.851 --> 10:44.353
Give me weapons!

10:47.397 --> 10:48.865
Why are you empty 7!

10:48.857 --> 10:51.110
I was being inspected.

10:51.192 --> 10:53.866
Guess I'll set up an ambush.

11:01.452 --> 11:04.956
<i>You hear that, Borma?
Get it done in ten minutes.</i>

11:05.039 --> 11:07.588
<i>Don't let Public Security
use the de-parallelizing code.</i>

11:07.584 --> 11:09.052
<i>Borma!</i>

11:11.713 --> 11:13.306
You bitch!

11:48.249 --> 11:50.251
Where'd they get that crap?

11:53.588 --> 11:57.138
<i>The range of domination is
still expanding, you know.</i>

11:57.133 --> 12:00.182
<i>The only solution is to get the module.</i>

12:00.261 --> 12:03.481
<i>Who are you? You've been spying
on me since I left Public Security.</i>

12:03.473 --> 12:08.274
<i>To ask for your help. I want you to
trust me and hand over the conveyer.</i>

12:08.353 --> 12:10.481
<i>I recognize your voice from yesterday.-.'</i>

12:10.480 --> 12:13.859
<i>Yes. I'm the one who infiltrated him.</i>

12:26.120 --> 12:28.043
<i>And Public Security's system going down?</i>

12:28.122 --> 12:29.999
<i>That wasn't me.</i>

12:29.999 --> 12:32.502
<i>That was the first move of the group</i>

12:32.502 --> 12:36.598
<i>using a special military module to carry
out a large-scale cyber operation.</i>

12:36.714 --> 12:37.966
<i>"Operation"?</i>

12:53.982 --> 12:55.450
Here I go!

13:16.004 --> 13:17.472
Logicoma!

13:23.344 --> 13:27.440
<i>The enemy stole the module's
de-parallelizing code from me.</i>

13:27.515 --> 13:31.190
<i>All I could do was replicate the code</i>

13:31.269 --> 13:37.072
<i>and copy it to an isolation-capable
A! they couldn't interfere with.</i>

13:37.066 --> 13:39.285
<i>You, in other words.</i>

13:39.360 --> 13:43.536
I knew it! I do carry an incredible secret!

13:43.614 --> 13:45.491
<i>- Indeed.
- Oh, dean.</i>

13:45.616 --> 13:47.960
Logicoma, full speed. Get us to the exit!

13:48.036 --> 13:49.879
Ave aye, sir!

13:58.713 --> 14:03.389
- Face front!
- Aaand stop!

14:05.636 --> 14:07.604
<i>'</i> Hey!
- Huh?

14:07.597 --> 14:09.270
Huh?

14:09.265 --> 14:10.812
Huh...?

14:16.564 --> 14:17.690
Shield!

14:25.907 --> 14:28.160
Huh?! I'm not broken.

14:48.846 --> 14:52.020
Where'd this "military moduleâ€œ come from?

14:52.100 --> 14:55.354
It's a Mass Field-Hacking Unit jointly
developed with seven leading companies

14:55.436 --> 14:57.939
in the old Silicon Valley.

14:57.939 --> 15:01.864
Military joint production'?
Are you an American agent?

15:02.860 --> 15:05.488
I'm Special Forces.

15:05.488 --> 15:09.538
My code name is "VV". I'm supporting
you in hope of your cooperation.

15:12.954 --> 15:15.377
Great, now we've got two enemies.

15:16.958 --> 15:20.963
So that agent came to take back the module.

15:21.045 --> 15:22.638
But don't let her throw you.

15:22.755 --> 15:27.556
All we have to do is destroy the Public
Security machine, and it's checkmate.

15:27.635 --> 15:29.683
How's the domination coming?

15:29.679 --> 15:31.727
We're close to target values.

15:31.806 --> 15:33.979
We won't let 'em get away with anything else.

15:33.975 --> 15:36.649
Get me a line and connect to the colonel.

15:37.645 --> 15:43.323
This war crimes court hereby sentences...

15:49.323 --> 15:50.996
Colonel Soga, how dare you?!

15:51.075 --> 15:53.169
Who the hell are you?!

15:53.161 --> 15:56.665
The Administrative Vice-Minister of Defense.
I want to talk to that man!

15:56.664 --> 16:01.886
Vice-Minister Kasuga.
I'm flattered by your concern.

16:01.878 --> 16:05.382
But I create my own circumstances.

16:05.381 --> 16:05.973
Excuse me?

16:06.090 --> 16:09.811
Those who obstruct my Net
will disappear from this city.

16:13.556 --> 16:16.856
I only desire one thing.-.

16:22.607 --> 16:25.781
To make our truths known!

16:34.869 --> 16:37.543
Aramaki, I assume you've heard of Soga?

16:37.538 --> 16:42.044
Kazuya Soga, the war criminal in
the Qhardistan massacre, correct?

16:42.293 --> 16:47.390
He's the man behind this traffic chaos.

16:47.465 --> 16:51.220
He's still connected to the Net even
after we tossed him in an isolation cell.

16:51.302 --> 16:53.396
Can't the great Section 9 stop him?!

16:54.388 --> 16:56.982
He's on an independent line
via military satellite.

16:57.058 --> 16:58.935
We'd have to open a hole
in our tactical defenses:

16:58.935 --> 17:02.735
either kill the line with him,
or shoot down the satellite.

17:02.730 --> 17:04.482
Out of the question!

17:04.565 --> 17:07.569
Then our hands are tied for the moment.

17:07.568 --> 17:11.914
Even with all Home Affairs and civilian Als
working at full capacity, we wouldn't have

17:12.073 --> 17:16.795
the processing power to break his command
and take back the traffic control systems.

17:16.786 --> 17:21.337
They made him a scapegoat
when he refused to testify in court.

17:21.415 --> 17:26.762
I did what I could to commute his sentence...

17:26.753 --> 17:28.597
But I never thought he'd mobilize his unit!

17:29.131 --> 17:31.600
His motive is clear, anyway.

17:31.592 --> 17:36.268
To an honest soldier, a postwar
military purge is a state betrayal.

17:38.099 --> 17:40.773
Well, have a seat.

17:40.851 --> 17:43.775
Where did his unit get those weapons?

17:43.854 --> 17:46.448
The lower-ranking NCOs are on strike right now,

17:46.524 --> 17:49.698
so it wouldn't surprise anyone
if a whole arsenal disappeared.

17:51.654 --> 17:54.373
One last thing, then: What's he after?

17:57.451 --> 18:00.625
He's demanding access to a military database...

18:01.956 --> 18:04.505
...called "Pandora".

18:04.500 --> 18:07.219
State secrets?

18:07.295 --> 18:12.643
Does he mean to bring the details of an
Army operation before the war crimes court?

18:12.633 --> 18:14.226
That's not all.

18:15.469 --> 18:18.473
He wants to air the Army's and Public
Security's dirty laundry to the world

18:18.556 --> 18:22.811
in exchange for this city's 20 million
cars and the people in them.

18:22.893 --> 18:27.490
He wants Japan itself to be judged,
just like he was judged?

18:27.565 --> 18:33.243
Other countries would use war crimes
as a pretext for all sorts of demands...

18:33.321 --> 18:36.165
We might as well be under occupation again.

18:36.240 --> 18:41.838
As the war's greatest losers, our country
would be the world's puppet state.

18:41.829 --> 18:45.834
It doesn't even bear discussing!
We'll never give in to that demand!

18:45.833 --> 18:49.053
Are you speaking on behalf of Home Affairs?

18:49.045 --> 18:51.798
N-No! But...

18:56.844 --> 18:58.687
<i>Colonel Kazuya Soga ?</i>

18:58.763 --> 19:03.439
He commanded an op in Qhardistan
that won him high praise.

19:03.517 --> 19:06.236
Then he was accused of conducting
a massacre during the op

19:06.228 --> 19:10.199
and convicted as a war criminal.
He's currently in custody.

19:10.191 --> 19:13.536
<i>A hero during the war, and a criminal afterward.</i>

19:13.527 --> 19:18.408
<i>And Soga's sympathizers are using
the module to seek his release?</i>

19:18.407 --> 19:19.374
Major--

19:19.450 --> 19:23.375
She's an informant. I brought
her in on a provisional basis.

19:23.829 --> 19:26.207
<i>What exactly is this "module"?</i>

19:26.874 --> 19:31.721
It creates processing power on
the level of a giant nationwide system.

19:31.796 --> 19:37.474
They must have used it to parallelize
something low-capacity in huge quantities.

19:37.551 --> 19:38.803
<i>Your opinion?</i>

19:38.886 --> 19:40.980
I agree with Major Kusanagi.

19:41.055 --> 19:44.400
And is your objective to retrieve the module?

19:44.392 --> 19:46.440
Or destroy it.

19:46.435 --> 19:52.659
The most effective method is to use
the code I evacuated into your Al

19:52.733 --> 19:55.987
from somewhere free of enemy interference.

19:56.070 --> 19:58.573
<i>Why was it stolen in the first place?</i>

19:58.656 --> 20:04.083
The module was a model brought here for
top-secret standards sharing with Japan.

20:04.078 --> 20:09.175
<i>I take it your colleagues are making a
top-secret investigation of the theft?</i>

20:09.250 --> 20:12.003
I'll leave that to your imagination.

20:12.086 --> 20:15.886
<i>Along with how you pinpointed
the enemy's smuggling point?</i>

20:16.257 --> 20:18.931
Both issues are the purview of the
Administrative Vice-Minister of Defense,

20:19.009 --> 20:23.014
but he didn't mention them
when I spoke to him just now.

20:23.097 --> 20:26.021
Evidently somethings being hushed up.

20:26.100 --> 20:27.352
<i>Another reason I want you</i>

20:27.435 --> 20:31.440
<i>to tel! the Ministry of Home Affairs
to give my squad top priority.</i>

20:31.522 --> 20:34.617
Since when do you have a squad?!

20:34.608 --> 20:39.990
I'm about to form one. Based on skill,
with no ranks, and given top priority.

20:39.989 --> 20:43.209
Bad plan! Special forces
teams aren't mercenaries!

20:43.284 --> 20:45.662
If you take advantage of
a disaster for your own gain,

20:45.661 --> 20:48.790
<i>the defense world will treat you like a vulture!</i>

20:48.956 --> 20:51.300
I'm not interested in teams out for money

20:51.292 --> 20:55.968
or ministry bigwigs gunning
for postwar concessions.

20:56.046 --> 20:59.300
<i>Tel! me this: How are the
Home Affairs higher-ups?</i>

20:59.383 --> 21:02.307
Having themselves an "elite panic"
with the Ministry of Defense.

21:02.428 --> 21:06.308
They're afraid the public
will panic if word gets out,

21:06.390 --> 21:09.485
so other than a few of my units,
they won't order anyone to act.

21:09.560 --> 21:12.154
<i>We're the only ones who can act right now.</i>

21:12.229 --> 21:18.453
A team formed on a fixed standard that
will be necessary everywhere in every age.

21:29.997 --> 21:32.250
So it's finally taking off.

21:58.943 --> 22:01.037
Whoops, survived again.

22:02.530 --> 22:05.158
Playing Russian roulette in a virtual reality?

22:10.287 --> 22:13.962
Do you reproduce the sensation of the
bullet penetrating your cranium, too'?

22:14.041 --> 22:15.714
You've got a sickness.

22:16.710 --> 22:19.884
Kusanagi from the 501!
When did you sneak in here?!

22:19.964 --> 22:26.222
I'm independent. The op in Qhardistan,
the American Army module, and Soga...

22:26.220 --> 22:29.941
Tell me what you know, or take
a real-life bullet. Your choice.

22:29.932 --> 22:32.230
Hold on! Why come to me?

22:32.226 --> 22:34.820
You served under Soga in Qhardistan.

22:34.895 --> 22:38.741
There's a record of lshikawa
calling you on your private line.

22:38.816 --> 22:43.492
Hey, I turned down the job with the 78th!
The pay wasn't good enough.

22:43.571 --> 22:47.246
The Marines' ace sniper turned into
a compulsive gambler after the war'?

22:47.324 --> 22:51.295
Is that why your unit's leave-time
budget's been cooked to high hell?

22:51.412 --> 22:53.039
How did you know--

22:54.123 --> 22:57.502
If your postwar days are about
turning your life into cash,

22:57.585 --> 23:00.008
I'll play your game.

23:00.087 --> 23:04.092
Join my spec ops team in the next five seconds,

23:04.174 --> 23:08.429
or the money you embezzled gets
transferred to Maritime Command.

23:08.429 --> 23:10.932
Bitch.

23:11.015 --> 23:12.938
I'll pay you a salary.

23:16.979 --> 23:20.324
The radio's still up, right? Divert everyone
before we lose the whole system.

23:54.224 --> 23:56.101
So you're the MP?

23:56.226 --> 23:59.230
What'd she threaten you with to bring you in?

23:59.355 --> 24:01.232
Oh, I volunteered.

24:01.357 --> 24:04.486
I've been waiting for the
Major to start up her team.

24:04.568 --> 24:06.491
You're a messed-up guy.

24:13.577 --> 24:16.672
How can you control this
with the domination going on?

24:16.664 --> 24:19.543
This antique has some special specifications.

24:19.541 --> 24:23.512
It's in a whole different class from
your friend's old clunker there!

24:30.010 --> 24:34.436
Since we can't cut Soga's Net,
we'll have to physically seize the module.

24:34.515 --> 24:38.440
This facility is the most likely
candidate for our enemy's base.

24:38.519 --> 24:40.692
I see; you'll only give us our target's location.

24:40.771 --> 24:43.615
You don't want to get your own hands dirty.

24:43.691 --> 24:45.864
I'm a neat freak.

24:45.943 --> 24:48.867
An old communications equipment company, eh?

24:48.862 --> 24:53.868
Not much for a sniper to do if
they're holed up in a server room.

24:53.867 --> 24:58.043
Don't worry, I'll smoke out
plenty of targets for you.

25:09.717 --> 25:11.219
Bingo? Seriously?

25:11.301 --> 25:15.306
Just one squad, and they get their
own ground support chopper...

25:15.431 --> 25:17.058
Good grief.

25:44.001 --> 25:45.173
<i>We're going, Logicoma.</i>

25:45.252 --> 25:48.506
Huh? But I'm not done with the sensors...

25:48.589 --> 25:50.432
What?! Really?!

25:55.429 --> 25:57.898
- Safe...
- You're <i>slow!</i>

26:06.940 --> 26:08.283
<i>Paz, status?</i>

26:08.275 --> 26:11.825
<i>Not sure whether it went well or not, but I'm in.</i>

26:11.820 --> 26:15.825
<i>So are we. Report if you find the module.</i>

26:15.824 --> 26:16.791
<i>Let's do this.</i>

26:16.867 --> 26:18.369
<i>NO USS!</i>

26:29.046 --> 26:30.639
A barrier maze?

26:34.510 --> 26:36.979
This processing speed...

26:36.970 --> 26:41.897
You people can't stop my Net.

26:43.393 --> 26:47.489
In about an hour, Pandora's lid will open.

26:47.481 --> 26:51.531
It's impossible to stop me before then.

26:51.527 --> 26:54.497
You want revenge against
the country that badly?

26:56.573 --> 26:58.826
I'm uncovering the truth.

27:53.422 --> 27:56.767
<i>The op to move the refugees in Qhardistan</i>

27:56.758 --> 27:59.728
<i>was the 78th Composite Unit's final mission.</i>

27:59.845 --> 28:02.223
Which was an extermination op you led?

28:02.306 --> 28:03.353
<i>No!</i>

28:03.891 --> 28:05.359
This is...

28:09.771 --> 28:12.650
<i>They were unarmed refugees.</i>

28:12.733 --> 28:16.738
<i>Afterward, a conglomerate occupied their land.</i>

28:16.820 --> 28:20.870
<i>Someone ordered their slaughter
to benefit the national interest.</i>

28:35.923 --> 28:37.425
Give me water!

29:03.617 --> 29:06.416
This is the first step.

29:06.620 --> 29:12.423
I'll put all the nations who led the
world into war in that same position.

29:12.542 --> 29:15.466
Soga! You've been inf--

29:22.135 --> 29:23.637
Soga?

29:27.933 --> 29:31.654
This is... a gap in the maze, maybe?

29:31.645 --> 29:35.320
How did she leave the
barrier maze? No--she didn't.

29:43.699 --> 29:45.576
Soga can't see me?

29:45.659 --> 29:47.832
<i>I did</i> manage to land in a gap.

29:57.879 --> 29:59.756
An accident-prevention Al?!

30:00.507 --> 30:03.932
He's parallelized all the Als
in Japan's traffic network!

30:26.533 --> 30:28.206
That was close.

30:28.285 --> 30:32.586
My barrier won't last long. Let's hurry.

30:32.581 --> 30:36.961
It's been three minutes since we
lost contact with Major Kusanagi.

30:37.044 --> 30:39.046
Call from the Ministry of Defense.

30:39.046 --> 30:43.096
A DoS attack on the Pandora
barrier began four minutes ago.

30:43.091 --> 30:45.059
<i>We can't keep up with it.</i>

30:46.470 --> 30:50.100
Sounds like it was a mistake to
give Public Security free rein!

30:50.098 --> 30:54.148
You invited this by carelessly stirring Soga up!

30:56.605 --> 30:59.609
Major! Are you all right?
What's the situation?

30:59.608 --> 31:03.909
<i>Soga took over the traffic control
system through the module.</i>

31:03.987 --> 31:08.413
<i>But the threat to kill if we
didn't release Pandora was fake.</i>

31:08.492 --> 31:10.836
<i>He intends to use the vast
system power he's gained</i>

31:10.911 --> 31:13.084
<i>to break Pandora wide open.</i>

31:14.164 --> 31:15.632
<i>I</i> see...

31:16.750 --> 31:19.594
In that case, there are steps we can take.

31:19.669 --> 31:22.889
You keep working to recover the module.

31:26.885 --> 31:28.262
<i>Nice timing!</i>

31:28.637 --> 31:31.356
The deal with the government should be a bluff.

31:31.431 --> 31:33.604
Colonel Soga went too far.

31:33.600 --> 31:36.774
This started as a plan for the
Vice-Minister to sell Pandora!

31:36.853 --> 31:40.699
We can't survive turning
the whole world against us!

31:40.774 --> 31:44.449
If you've got cold feet, run.
Nobody'll stop you.

31:44.945 --> 31:46.572
Negotiate a deal or whatever.

31:46.696 --> 31:48.073
<i>L</i> sure Will!

31:49.783 --> 31:51.877
If you're in this for money, run without a fight.

32:00.127 --> 32:03.802
Hey! Home Affairs just gave us money!

32:03.797 --> 32:05.640
Give it to someone who cares!

32:06.800 --> 32:09.553
We're withdrawing. I'll buy some time.

32:09.636 --> 32:14.392
The colonel didn't even wait
to clear the 78th's name.

32:14.474 --> 32:15.976
Why do you figure that is?

32:17.018 --> 32:18.645
Kasuga!

32:20.147 --> 32:22.149
The colonel got scapegoated...!

32:22.232 --> 32:23.529
Let's go!

32:23.525 --> 32:25.698
I'll meet up with you once I've stalled them.

32:25.694 --> 32:27.571
Do it fast.

32:27.654 --> 32:29.247
<i>Paz, do you read me?</i>

32:29.322 --> 32:30.369
<i>More or less.</i>

32:30.365 --> 32:32.367
<i>Do you know an intelligence
man named lshikawa?</i>

32:32.367 --> 32:33.914
<i>Sure do.</i>

32:36.746 --> 32:39.420
<i>If you find him, use a cable
to get him to the cyber lobby.</i>

32:39.499 --> 32:40.500
<i>Roger!</i>

32:40.584 --> 32:43.007
<i>I'm hanging up before they detect our line.</i>

32:43.086 --> 32:47.592
Shit. The colonel's got domination,
but they're still roaming free!

32:51.928 --> 32:54.932
Don't underestimate me. I can locate
even a super-wizard-class hacker

32:55.015 --> 32:58.269
if they make a call during domination!

32:58.351 --> 33:04.029
The Major's got business with you.
Let me connect you, and nobody gets hurt.

33:04.024 --> 33:07.949
Try it, kiddo. I'll play with you.

33:18.538 --> 33:22.259
Be a good boy, and you won't get hurt.

33:22.250 --> 33:23.797
You mean you won't.

33:25.545 --> 33:28.719
She was playing me with that call?
Damn gorilla woman!

33:30.550 --> 33:32.803
Who are you calling a gorilla?

33:36.056 --> 33:37.899
Major Kusanagi!

33:43.897 --> 33:46.241
Planning to stick me with a virus?

33:46.233 --> 33:48.952
The opposite. I think you're already infected.

33:48.944 --> 33:50.241
What?

33:50.320 --> 33:54.575
It's a makeshift vaccine, so you'll
have to put up with any bugs.

34:03.416 --> 34:05.589
I've lost contact with lshikawa.

34:05.585 --> 34:07.258
I'll go.

34:07.337 --> 34:10.762
I'll take the module and go on ahead.
We rendezvous at the trap!

34:10.840 --> 34:12.056
Roger!

34:12.509 --> 34:13.601
Drive.

34:15.762 --> 34:19.266
<i>Shit. You, Saito?!</i>

34:19.349 --> 34:22.649
<i>We're all pros here. No holding a grudge.</i>

34:22.643 --> 34:25.362
<i>If you're a pro, join the side that pays best.</i>

34:25.438 --> 34:28.783
<i>Home Affairs paid us.
I'll give you a triple share.</i>

34:29.275 --> 34:31.449
<i>Take it from my account!</i>

34:31.527 --> 34:32.574
<i>For real?!</i>

34:41.036 --> 34:42.289
lshikawa!

34:42.289 --> 34:44.507
C'mon, let's get back to guarding the module.

34:44.498 --> 34:45.967
Don't move.

34:47.002 --> 34:48.879
Hey! lshikawa?!

34:52.047 --> 34:57.521
Major! They all left.
Only one car stayed behind.

34:58.972 --> 35:02.146
- It didn't work!
- Damn, they pulled out already?

35:02.142 --> 35:04.144
They've got good judgment.

35:04.144 --> 35:07.819
Paz, you go in VV's car.
I'll go with the Logicoma!

35:12.652 --> 35:13.995
<i>Saito!</i>

35:27.334 --> 35:29.712
You transferred them money'?!

35:29.711 --> 35:33.341
Why would you swallow
the enemy's bluff so easily?

35:33.340 --> 35:35.889
<i>This is the result of our negotiation with Soga.</i>

35:35.884 --> 35:38.683
<i>We planned to put the money
toward the Economic Amnesty Act,</i>

35:38.678 --> 35:43.149
<i>but it came from vet pensions that
got slashed in the Army budget cuts.</i>

35:43.141 --> 35:47.021
Do you honestly think
that's what they're after'?!

35:47.145 --> 35:50.490
Just whose cause are we
supposed to be working for here?

35:50.607 --> 35:54.532
<i>The funds will be traced, and the Department
of Defense is taking responsibility.</i>

35:54.653 --> 35:57.202
<i>Our people stay out of this, got it?</i>

36:01.493 --> 36:03.712
<i>Did you check up on the
enemy's parallel circuitry?</i>

36:03.703 --> 36:08.209
The on board Als of 20 million
vehicles in this city are in enemy control.

36:08.208 --> 36:09.380
Including my car.

36:09.501 --> 36:13.722
The system is so overpowered we can
hardly manage to move one chopper.

36:13.838 --> 36:18.264
But there is a way to turn
the tables, if only temporarily.

36:18.385 --> 36:20.058
<i>Tell me.</i>

36:36.027 --> 36:38.655
Charge!

36:40.865 --> 36:42.742
Here already?!

36:46.204 --> 36:47.922
Logicoma, the tires!

36:57.006 --> 36:59.100
Cut between them. You take right!

37:13.565 --> 37:16.785
A car?! How can they move
during our domination?

37:18.027 --> 37:19.620
Here we go, Paz.

37:34.294 --> 37:35.796
<i>He's taken over my car!</i>

37:36.880 --> 37:39.474
<i>"Special specifications", my ass!</i>

37:39.549 --> 37:44.100
<i>He quit everything to focus some
crazy pressure on me! It's too much!</i>

37:45.221 --> 37:46.222
<i>lshikawa!</i>

37:46.598 --> 37:49.272
Damn gorilla woman's calling.

37:54.773 --> 37:56.275
lshikawa?

38:01.446 --> 38:04.325
Shit. Never figured the
colonel'd try to brain-fry me!

38:04.407 --> 38:07.331
I can't believe it--did he really'?!

38:07.410 --> 38:11.290
We're about to find out what the truth is.

38:14.918 --> 38:17.341
I have control!

38:22.258 --> 38:24.511
Ishikawa's cooperating with 'em?

38:43.905 --> 38:45.657
<i>Saito!</i>

38:45.657 --> 38:48.376
<i>Sorry, lady, but they sweetened the pot.</i>

38:50.203 --> 38:51.876
<i>Good work, Saito!</i>

38:53.498 --> 38:57.548
<i>We're almost to the trap.
Once we get there...</i>

38:57.544 --> 38:59.922
<i>We win!</i>

38:59.921 --> 39:02.720
<i>You damn gambling-freak mercenary!</i>

39:25.864 --> 39:29.494
Huh? I can't see them anymore.

39:39.586 --> 39:41.884
This makes no sense.

39:41.880 --> 39:42.927
Where are they?!

39:44.048 --> 39:46.847
Five minutes to infiltration of Pandora.

39:49.554 --> 39:53.934
<i>There's no record that I've been hacked,
so why did they vanish?!</i>

39:53.933 --> 39:56.777
<i>They didn't overwrite your vision.</i>

39:56.895 --> 39:58.147
<i>Can you move?!</i>

39:58.146 --> 40:01.070
<i>I lost my right arm, but don't worry--
we're still in the game.</i>

40:01.065 --> 40:04.114
<i>So what was their trick?</i>

40:04.110 --> 40:07.580
<i>They used our own skills to
fake us out. Slick of them.</i>

40:07.572 --> 40:10.576
<i>It's an old type of optical
camouflage holograph.</i>

40:10.575 --> 40:12.998
<i>I'd have missed it if we weren't going so slowly.</i>

40:12.994 --> 40:14.792
<i>I'll send you the location.</i>

40:14.913 --> 40:19.339
<i>Securing the module is top priority.
We're out of time.</i>

40:19.334 --> 40:21.507
They figured it out?

40:21.502 --> 40:23.470
They're damn persistent!

40:53.326 --> 40:53.997
Fire!

40:54.160 --> 40:55.252
Aye!

41:27.235 --> 41:30.409
<i>We can't go fast, so it'll take us a bit.</i>

41:30.405 --> 41:33.534
No problem. Logicoma, you stay there.

41:33.658 --> 41:35.626
<i>Wait until we get to you!</i>

41:41.416 --> 41:42.759
Skilled as always.

41:42.750 --> 41:47.972
But you're not the only one good
at infiltrating vision, 501 Major...

41:48.089 --> 41:49.636
No, just "Major" now.

42:07.984 --> 42:09.406
Paz!

42:10.111 --> 42:12.739
VV, get the module, fast!

42:16.826 --> 42:19.420
Ten seconds to infiltration of Pandora.

42:19.495 --> 42:23.250
9, 8, 7, 6...

42:42.435 --> 42:48.784
<i>We set up 317 roadblocks, from Wards 1
through 38. Do we keep going?</i>

42:48.775 --> 42:52.120
Mobilize all forces and
put up <i>as</i> many as you can.

42:52.278 --> 42:56.454
We'll tie up all vehicles' on board computers
with accident-avoidance processes.

42:56.449 --> 42:58.952
The fate of our nation is at stake.

42:59.118 --> 43:00.791
I feel bad for the MLIT,

43:00.953 --> 43:04.457
but I'm going to cause the
worst gridlock in thirty years.

43:14.008 --> 43:16.511
Aramaki from Public Security?

43:20.640 --> 43:22.187
This is his doing?

43:38.616 --> 43:39.708
Paz!

43:50.670 --> 43:55.676
<i>You're too late. Soga's opening
up Pandora as we speak.</i>

43:55.675 --> 43:58.178
Nope. His power is down.

43:59.679 --> 44:04.025
Public Security's stopped more than
30% of the vehicles that were in motion.

44:15.862 --> 44:19.708
Both you and Colonel Soga
had been deliberately infected.

45:00.573 --> 45:04.749
There is no "truth" about
that refugee transport op.

45:04.911 --> 45:08.586
You killed those people
and ordered an air-strike.

45:08.748 --> 45:12.673
You did it because all the "refugees"
you were trying to safeguard

45:12.752 --> 45:15.096
were armed guerillas.

45:22.929 --> 45:25.102
It's the MOD's responsibility now.

45:25.097 --> 45:28.601
Either do something about him,
or destroy Pandora right now!

45:28.768 --> 45:30.941
Obviously out of the question!

45:32.605 --> 45:35.950
Because you want me to open Pandora?

45:36.108 --> 45:37.610
What?

45:38.611 --> 45:40.113
Don't!

45:42.198 --> 45:43.666
You bastard!

45:45.785 --> 45:47.708
Wait! Don't shoot!

45:48.412 --> 45:51.962
It was the Administrative Vice-Minister
who gave me the module.

45:52.500 --> 45:54.798
That agent's objective is the same.

45:54.961 --> 45:58.465
Make sure you don't use
the de-parallelizing code.

45:58.464 --> 45:59.966
What?

46:01.300 --> 46:05.806
I can't stop the infiltration.
This is the only way!

46:05.972 --> 46:06.894
Stop!

46:15.648 --> 46:17.650
I gave you a copy of the vaccine.

46:17.650 --> 46:21.826
It's imperfect, but you'll be able
to tell which memories are false.

46:21.821 --> 46:26.167
It's unlikely we'll be able to
eradicate them, but I'll give you a hand.

46:26.158 --> 46:27.660
Not interested.

46:29.328 --> 46:34.175
It's the only memory that lets me feel
like I'm not just a dog trained to kill!

46:37.211 --> 46:39.839
You're just a whiny bitch, then.

46:41.674 --> 46:43.176
<i>What happened, Major?!</i>

46:43.175 --> 46:45.849
<i>It's over. Send a rescue squad.</i>

46:45.970 --> 46:48.519
<i>What do you mean, "over"?!</i>

46:48.681 --> 46:50.354
Pandora's been infiltrated!

46:50.516 --> 46:54.020
The data's being leaked to
a different Net than Soga's!

46:58.482 --> 47:00.359
Step away from the module!

47:09.869 --> 47:14.545
Don't resist. I feel an affinity with you.

47:14.540 --> 47:19.717
You, who haven't had a flesh-and-blood
body for as long as you can remember.

47:28.262 --> 47:29.889
You bitch...

47:39.899 --> 47:42.743
That attack barrier is meaningless.

47:45.196 --> 47:49.417
My brain has to be synchronized, like his.

47:53.120 --> 47:56.420
A neurochip? You're...

47:57.583 --> 47:59.756
I must find out where it came from--

48:00.211 --> 48:06.935
this thing which infected me
and gave me true self-awareness.

48:06.926 --> 48:12.524
Even if I have to access the whole world's
organizations and their secrets...

48:12.598 --> 48:14.100
...I shall.

48:28.739 --> 48:33.290
You're an artificial intelligence
pretending to be human...

48:33.452 --> 48:35.625
What for?!

48:35.746 --> 48:38.625
I just have to know.

48:38.624 --> 48:45.803
My Ghost whi...spered... that... to... me...

48:47.800 --> 48:49.643
Ghost...

48:54.932 --> 48:55.979
Huh?

48:55.975 --> 48:57.818
A certain intelligence agency admitted

48:57.810 --> 49:02.156
that one of its Als was infected
with an unknown virus on the Net

49:02.148 --> 49:04.822
and began acting outside of their control.

49:04.942 --> 49:07.161
And it absconded with the module,

49:07.319 --> 49:09.993
then manipulated the Vice-Minister.

49:09.989 --> 49:14.085
He made too many dangerous
deals during the war.

49:14.160 --> 49:17.664
He intended to sell the contents
of Pandora and flee the country.

49:17.663 --> 49:22.510
That's why he manipulated Soga
and sent in a team of his own pawns.

49:22.668 --> 49:27.174
But Soga seized control of the situation,
so the Al planned a recovery strategy.

49:27.173 --> 49:30.518
"A rogue Al did it all"--how very convenient.

49:30.509 --> 49:34.355
Even if it's half true, I'm sure <i>they</i>
let things lie to try to profit from her.

49:34.472 --> 49:38.943
Though it seems they're not the
only ones to try to profit from this.

49:39.018 --> 49:41.020
You're the one who came to me.

49:41.187 --> 49:44.191
With the result that you made
your team a fait accompli

49:44.315 --> 49:47.114
with the highest possible priority.

49:47.193 --> 49:50.914
Want to re-register as part of Section 9?

49:51.030 --> 49:54.876
They'll cancel this registration
if you can't get enough people together.

49:54.992 --> 49:56.039
No thanks.

49:56.619 --> 50:00.214
I appreciate your help
with the paperwork, though.

50:18.682 --> 50:21.811
It'll close in five minutes.
Decide before then.

50:21.894 --> 50:26.400
Sit there and get sentenced in one
of the speed-trials the system loves,

50:26.398 --> 50:28.901
or join my squad.

50:29.068 --> 50:32.743
You say that to everyone you've
been in shooting matches with?

50:32.905 --> 50:36.409
I can only get people infected
with the memory virus released.

50:36.575 --> 50:39.749
Though those three are the ones I want anyway.

50:39.745 --> 50:42.919
They'll accept that after we just
picked a fight with the government'?

50:43.082 --> 50:46.086
If I, Section 9, and a certain
country's intelligence agency

50:46.252 --> 50:49.256
testify about the false memories.

50:49.255 --> 50:51.257
lshikawa and Borma agreed.

50:51.423 --> 50:55.269
As for Saito, when I paid him a little
visit before he could go to ground,

50:55.261 --> 50:58.435
he begged me to let him join.

51:00.766 --> 51:03.110
You're some piece of work.

51:03.269 --> 51:06.273
So, you're telling me to be
Public Security's errand boy?

51:06.438 --> 51:09.783
It's an independent offensive unit
based on skill, with no ranks,

51:09.942 --> 51:11.615
and it has top priority.

51:11.777 --> 51:15.782
I'll give you memories of being
more than a dog trained to kill.

51:21.287 --> 51:25.133
These fake memories--can you really erase 'em?

51:25.291 --> 51:27.293
I can try.
