00:20.969 --> 00:23.303
Aah!

00:23.337 --> 00:25.974
Hank?

00:26.008 --> 00:27.876
Good God, man, you're giving me
the fuckin' willies.

00:27.910 --> 00:29.746
Thought it'd help my cause.

00:29.780 --> 00:31.981
Who can turn their backs
on a sad clown?

00:32.016 --> 00:33.416
[Chuckles]

00:33.450 --> 00:36.185
Let me guess:
My wife and your daughter.

00:36.219 --> 00:38.354
Not even so much as a smile.

00:38.388 --> 00:39.955
You still hittin' the sauce?

00:39.990 --> 00:42.524
Yeah, but, I mean,
I got it under control.

00:42.559 --> 00:43.525
Uh-huh.

00:43.560 --> 00:44.793
Falling off the wagon

00:44.827 --> 00:48.030
is typically followed
by a bit of a bender.

00:48.064 --> 00:51.068
I mean, it usually works
itself out in a week or three.

00:51.103 --> 00:53.271
Ohh.

00:53.305 --> 00:55.674
I'm not worried.

00:55.708 --> 00:57.309
I'm glad to hear that.

00:57.343 --> 00:59.311
I'm sorry, Hank.

00:59.345 --> 01:01.680
Okay?
They'll get over it.

01:01.714 --> 01:03.248
- Eventually.
- Yeah.

01:03.282 --> 01:04.649
Yeah, in a week or three,

01:04.684 --> 01:06.385
but that's the thing about this thing.

01:06.420 --> 01:08.254
- Hmm.
- There's nothing to get over.

01:08.288 --> 01:10.390
- Hey--
- I didn't actually do anything.

01:10.424 --> 01:12.392
Uh, you--you're
preaching to the choir, honey.

01:12.427 --> 01:14.361
Okay?
I wouldn't give two fucks

01:14.396 --> 01:16.163
if you had done it the way
they think you've done it.

01:16.198 --> 01:17.231
But I didn't done it.

01:17.266 --> 01:19.735
Okay. I get it.

01:21.604 --> 01:22.972
Man, you know I'd never tell, right?

01:23.006 --> 01:25.508
That shit would be between
you, me, and the wall.

01:25.543 --> 01:26.910
I'd take a fuckin' blood oath.

01:26.944 --> 01:29.113
- Nothing actually happened.
- Okay.

01:29.147 --> 01:30.248
So there's nothing to tell you.

01:30.282 --> 01:32.050
- I believe you.
- It's due today, so...

01:32.085 --> 01:35.221
Both: I'm sorry, baby.

01:35.255 --> 01:37.390
Come in.
I'll make you some breakfast.

01:37.424 --> 01:39.092
Ooh, yummy--that sounds good.
I could eat.

01:39.126 --> 01:40.761
Can you tell him
I'm not talking to him?

01:40.795 --> 01:42.896
- She's not talking to him.
- What?

01:42.930 --> 01:44.798
Well, that's a fine
how-do-you-do-do.

01:44.832 --> 01:46.433
You'll forgive him, but not me?

01:46.467 --> 01:47.934
I'll work on her for you.

01:47.969 --> 01:49.437
One day at a time, Batesy.

01:49.471 --> 01:52.640
[Cell phone chiming]

01:52.674 --> 01:55.276
Ah, hells to the no!

01:55.310 --> 01:56.644
Hank fuckin' Moody.
[Rap music in background]

01:56.678 --> 01:58.946
No more notes, Sam.
I can't take it.

01:58.980 --> 02:00.414
Just find another writer.

02:00.449 --> 02:02.450
I won't be offended.
I promise.

02:02.484 --> 02:03.817
It ain't about that movie shit, man.

02:03.852 --> 02:06.520
I need to see your ass now, though.

02:06.555 --> 02:08.823
- What about?
- Kali.

02:08.857 --> 02:11.360
What about Kali?

02:11.394 --> 02:12.661
Not over the phone, nigga.

02:12.696 --> 02:15.498
Just get your ass over
to my studio right now.

02:18.002 --> 02:19.803
- You hear me?
- Yeah. I'm coming.

02:19.837 --> 02:21.705
Or else my boys come get you,
nigga--your choice.

02:21.740 --> 02:23.307
No, no, no, no.
No, that--that's okay.

02:23.342 --> 02:25.043
Don't blow me off, Moody.
I'm serious, man.

02:25.077 --> 02:26.477
I'm on my way.

02:26.512 --> 02:27.979
All right, mo'fucker.

03:22.272 --> 03:23.573
I can explain.

03:23.607 --> 03:26.342
You better fuckin'
explain yourself, motherfucker.

03:26.376 --> 03:27.810
Well, it was a long flight.

03:27.844 --> 03:29.478
You know, we got to talking.

03:29.512 --> 03:31.780
One thing led to another.

03:31.814 --> 03:33.514
What the fuck you talkin' about, man?

03:35.851 --> 03:37.017
I don't know, what the fuck
am I talkin' about?

03:37.051 --> 03:38.185
What the fuck am I talk--

03:38.219 --> 03:39.352
What the fuck are you talkin' about?

03:39.387 --> 03:40.987
I'm talkin' about the fact

03:41.022 --> 03:42.889
that you're always fuckin' late, man.

03:42.923 --> 03:44.223
Oh, all right.

03:44.258 --> 03:45.725
That's some real
passive-aggressive shit, right?

03:45.759 --> 03:46.893
You think your time is more valuable

03:46.927 --> 03:48.061
than my time, don't you?

03:48.096 --> 03:49.329
- Actually--
- I sense that shit, man.

03:49.364 --> 03:50.330
Actually, I don't.
I don't.

03:50.365 --> 03:52.166
But--but in a larger sense,

03:52.200 --> 03:54.135
my time will always be my time.

03:54.169 --> 03:55.970
So it will always mean
more to me personally.

03:56.005 --> 03:58.206
Ah, man, shut the fuck up
and buy a watch, nigga.

03:58.240 --> 03:59.207
A'ight.

03:59.242 --> 04:00.208
In the meantime, nigga,

04:00.243 --> 04:01.610
I need your help, Moody.

04:01.645 --> 04:04.146
How can I be of service, my liege?

04:04.181 --> 04:05.515
I got this piece of music here, right?

04:05.549 --> 04:08.517
[Playing slow ballad on piano]

04:26.770 --> 04:29.238
That is... mighty purty.

04:29.273 --> 04:31.541
It's like vintage Elton John there.

04:31.575 --> 04:33.610
Yeah, well, this bitch
ain't no fuckin' Bernie Taupin.

04:33.644 --> 04:35.178
That's why we can't
work together, Calvin.

04:35.213 --> 04:36.380
Because if I'm not sleeping with him,

04:36.414 --> 04:37.448
he's a total fucking asshole.

04:37.482 --> 04:38.782
Yeah, well, you know...

04:38.817 --> 04:40.418
She can't write not
fuckin' lyrics, yo.

04:40.452 --> 04:42.019
Just a pretty face
and a fuckin' smile.

04:42.053 --> 04:43.521
All right, all right, all right.

04:43.555 --> 04:44.889
Well, how can I help?

04:44.923 --> 04:46.924
Help the girl write
some fuckin' lyrics, man.

04:46.959 --> 04:48.392
Oh, no, no.

04:48.427 --> 04:51.862
I write books...
screenplays, emails, uh--

04:51.896 --> 04:53.030
Nigga, writin' is writin', man.

04:53.064 --> 04:55.165
- I don't.
- Help a brother out.

04:59.603 --> 05:01.071
Okay, I'll give it a shot.

05:01.105 --> 05:03.707
But we're gonna have
to get good and drunk first.

05:03.741 --> 05:06.342
See, now, that's the best
fuckin' idea I've heard all day.

05:06.377 --> 05:08.277
Let's go.

05:08.312 --> 05:09.546
All right, so where are we starting?

05:09.580 --> 05:10.780
I don't know.

05:10.815 --> 05:12.282
It's obviously a love song, right?

05:12.317 --> 05:14.451
So what rhymes with love?

05:14.485 --> 05:16.320
Dove, shove.

05:16.354 --> 05:18.989
"Did you just shove a dove
up my ass and call it love?"

05:19.023 --> 05:19.990
Done!

05:20.024 --> 05:22.092
Writing lyrics is easy.

05:22.126 --> 05:23.760
Next!

05:23.794 --> 05:25.128
Okay, the "no fun" face.

05:25.163 --> 05:26.363
What do you wanna write about?

05:26.397 --> 05:27.597
I just don't want it to be cheesy.

05:27.631 --> 05:28.798
I didn't come all the way here

05:28.832 --> 05:30.699
to write cheesy love songs.

05:30.733 --> 05:32.267
Sorry, that's my thing.

05:32.301 --> 05:33.635
I specialize in cheese--

05:33.669 --> 05:35.636
big, gooey globs of it.

05:35.671 --> 05:36.738
You're out of luck.

05:36.772 --> 05:39.307
Okay, I just want it to be...

05:39.341 --> 05:41.108
bittersweet and dark.

05:41.143 --> 05:45.846
Well, you are nothing
if not a semisweet piece of...

05:45.881 --> 05:47.114
Milk chocolate?

05:49.051 --> 05:50.952
You are cheesy.

05:50.986 --> 05:51.986
Yeah.

05:52.020 --> 05:54.188
Speaking of love
and whatnot, um--

05:54.223 --> 05:55.590
Oh, two whiskies, barkeep, please,

05:55.624 --> 05:56.658
and keep 'em coming.

05:56.692 --> 05:58.826
I think the samurai is deep in it.

05:58.861 --> 06:00.128
Wit' you.

06:00.162 --> 06:01.397
God, please.

06:01.431 --> 06:03.265
What the fuck does that guy
know about love?

06:03.299 --> 06:04.834
He's a spoiled man-child.

06:04.868 --> 06:07.736
He gets whatever he wants,
and he can't have me.

06:07.771 --> 06:09.638
He just wants to control his product.

06:09.673 --> 06:11.106
I don't think that's it.

06:11.141 --> 06:13.141
I-I think everybody's
got that special someone

06:13.175 --> 06:15.109
that gets under their skin
and doesn't go away.

06:15.144 --> 06:16.110
I think maybe you have

06:16.145 --> 06:18.079
that particular
fungal property for him.

06:18.113 --> 06:19.980
[Chuckles]

06:20.015 --> 06:22.449
All right,
so if somebody was asking me

06:22.484 --> 06:23.850
about a short story,

06:23.885 --> 06:26.920
I'd ask them,
"What are you trying to say?"

06:28.456 --> 06:29.489
I don't know.

06:29.524 --> 06:33.092
Um...

06:33.127 --> 06:34.995
I'd love to talk about

06:35.029 --> 06:38.465
coming to L.A.
for the first time.

06:38.499 --> 06:41.902
And the fact that you
tend to leave something

06:41.936 --> 06:43.604
or someone behind.

06:43.638 --> 06:45.339
All right.

06:45.373 --> 06:47.742
Now we're getting somewhere.
I can relate to that.

06:47.776 --> 06:52.013
I can remember that shit
as if it were fuckin' yesterday.

06:52.048 --> 06:53.382
[Car horn blares]

06:55.486 --> 06:57.187
So what do you think?

06:57.221 --> 06:58.655
I don't know, you know.

06:58.690 --> 07:00.057
I think we should keep looking.

07:00.091 --> 07:01.292
- Really?
- Yeah.

07:01.326 --> 07:02.994
Oh, I got a good feeling
about this place.

07:03.028 --> 07:04.628
- Really?
- Especially the bedroom.

07:04.663 --> 07:06.697
I think we could get up
to some trouble in there--

07:06.731 --> 07:08.365
You've said that about
every place we've seen.

07:08.399 --> 07:09.433
Well, that's just a tribute

07:09.467 --> 07:11.335
to how warm I am for your form, woman.

07:11.369 --> 07:12.536
You know what?

07:12.571 --> 07:13.737
I'm still chafing
from this morning, so...

07:13.772 --> 07:15.472
I'm sorry.
Hotels make me horny.

07:15.507 --> 07:17.408
What doesn't make you horny, baby?

07:17.442 --> 07:19.710
Um... cockroaches.

07:19.744 --> 07:21.578
Dead babies.

07:21.613 --> 07:22.813
Poop.

07:22.847 --> 07:24.247
[Laughing] Shut up.

07:24.282 --> 07:25.582
Look how close we'd be to the beach.

07:25.616 --> 07:28.151
- And the homeless.
- Which would surely alleviate

07:28.185 --> 07:30.453
any homesickness for New York
that might develop.

07:30.488 --> 07:31.721
- [Groans]
- Oh, God.

07:31.756 --> 07:33.156
You so don't wanna do this, huh?

07:33.191 --> 07:35.358
You know what?
I just think of Becca.

07:35.393 --> 07:36.660
- Yeah?
- And I-I--

07:36.694 --> 07:38.328
and it--
it feels all wrong.

07:38.362 --> 07:40.130
But she's so little and adaptable.

07:40.164 --> 07:42.265
Not to mention
totally dependent on us.

07:42.300 --> 07:43.667
If she complained at all,

07:43.701 --> 07:45.335
we could easily threaten
to abandon her.

07:45.369 --> 07:48.071
I'm pretty sure that would
shut her up immediately.

07:48.105 --> 07:49.606
[Both laughing]

07:49.640 --> 07:51.908
You really sure about this?

07:51.942 --> 07:53.643
I'm not, no.
Not--not at all.

07:53.678 --> 07:55.278
- Jesus.
- Charlie thought it would be

07:55.313 --> 07:56.980
a good idea for me
to spend some time out here

07:57.014 --> 08:00.183
so people could put this
beautiful visage to the name.

08:00.217 --> 08:02.418
And I'm trying to do
what my agent says for once

08:02.453 --> 08:05.521
rather than just telling him
to fuck off and get me paid.

08:05.556 --> 08:06.656
You know what?

08:06.690 --> 08:08.257
Huh?

08:08.292 --> 08:09.659
We were doing just fine.

08:09.693 --> 08:11.694
- No, we weren't.
- Yes, we were, we were.

08:11.728 --> 08:13.796
We couldn't even afford cable, Karen.

08:13.830 --> 08:15.331
That was a choice.

08:15.365 --> 08:16.665
- Really?
- Yes.

08:16.699 --> 08:18.000
Whatever.

08:18.034 --> 08:21.736
You're not being
a very supportive baby mama.

08:21.770 --> 08:23.938
I thought I was your muse.

08:23.972 --> 08:26.073
You are.

08:26.108 --> 08:28.042
And right now, you're
inspiring me to point out that,

08:28.076 --> 08:30.444
compared to what we paid for
in New York for a broom closet,

08:30.478 --> 08:32.780
that place is a steal.

08:34.616 --> 08:35.849
- [Sighs]
- Plus, you'd get that.

08:35.884 --> 08:37.918
[Urine trickling]

08:37.953 --> 08:40.154
- [Laughing]
- Just like home.

08:41.523 --> 08:43.957
So next we have...

08:43.993 --> 08:45.861
We need to go to, um...

08:45.895 --> 08:47.762
- What is it, "Sepul-Veda"?
- Sepul-Veda?

08:47.797 --> 08:50.399
[Paper rustling]

08:50.433 --> 08:52.534
Look alive.

08:52.569 --> 08:54.103
Ah, sorry.

08:54.137 --> 08:56.039
Where'd you just go?

08:56.073 --> 08:57.140
Nowhere.

08:57.174 --> 08:59.376
Just digging deep.

08:59.410 --> 09:00.978
Okay...

09:01.012 --> 09:03.247
What rhymes with "vagina"?

09:03.281 --> 09:04.715
I'm not gonna
sing "vagina."

09:04.749 --> 09:06.116
Your loss--
that could be

09:06.150 --> 09:08.085
some seriously groundbreaking shit.

Yeah, some songwriter you are.

Ooh, ooh, ooh.

09:11.755 --> 09:13.255
Here we go.
I got something here.

Come on, come on, come on.
This is my career.

09:29.072 --> 09:30.339
You don't wanna have any fun?
No fun.

09:30.374 --> 09:31.674
Okay, no fun, no fun.

09:31.708 --> 09:32.775
All right, what do you
want to write about?

09:32.809 --> 09:36.245
[Sighs] I don't know.
I just...

09:36.280 --> 09:38.481
Well, tell me about
the guy you left behind.

09:38.516 --> 09:39.850
You know, that guy.
That one.

09:39.884 --> 09:42.386
Um...

09:42.420 --> 09:44.922
He was jealous.

09:44.956 --> 09:47.257
Well, you seem to attract
the jealous type.

09:47.291 --> 09:48.392
You bad girl, you.

09:48.426 --> 09:50.293
I'm not bad, I'm just...

09:50.328 --> 09:51.394
drawn that way.

09:51.428 --> 09:53.430
A hip-hop
Jessica Rabbit, huh?

09:53.464 --> 09:57.167
He didn't like...
the attention I was getting

09:57.201 --> 09:58.534
from our friend Samurai.

09:58.569 --> 10:00.036
Well, who could blame him?

10:00.070 --> 10:01.837
And that I got the offer to come here

10:01.871 --> 10:03.472
and to make a record.

10:03.506 --> 10:05.240
So...

I... have
an offer for you!

[Chuckles]

Why are you yelling?

10:13.850 --> 10:14.951
It's my style.

10:14.985 --> 10:17.153
My thing.
It's--it's bombastic.

10:17.188 --> 10:18.321
My clients love it.

10:18.356 --> 10:19.689
Not this client.

10:19.724 --> 10:21.124
- Oh.
- Sorry.

10:21.159 --> 10:23.127
- [Chuckles]
- What's the offer?

10:23.161 --> 10:25.396
There is a script.
It's at Universal.

10:25.430 --> 10:26.764
They're about to start production.

10:26.798 --> 10:27.798
They need a polish.

10:27.832 --> 10:29.333
Oh!
I can polish things.

10:29.368 --> 10:30.434
- Ah.
- Yeah.

10:30.469 --> 10:32.837
You have never polished anything...

10:32.871 --> 10:34.038
- Karen...
- In your entire life, ever.

10:34.072 --> 10:35.939
Do I not polish
your beautiful lady parts

10:35.974 --> 10:37.708
on a semi-nightly basis?

25 a week.

10:45.282 --> 10:46.248

10:46.282 --> 10:48.450
grand.

10:48.485 --> 10:50.519
- Look at his face.
- I love L.A.

10:50.553 --> 10:52.187
- [Laughs]
- I love it! I love it.

10:52.221 --> 10:53.655
I said it, I meant it.

10:53.689 --> 10:54.956
I'm here to represent it.

10:54.991 --> 10:56.458
- You know that.
- Who are you right now?

10:56.492 --> 10:57.759
I don't know.
I don't know.

10:57.793 --> 10:58.994
Whoo!

11:01.931 --> 11:03.498
I'm telling you--
ooh, ooh.

11:03.532 --> 11:05.166
I don't think that...

11:05.201 --> 11:06.701
a decision has yet been made.

11:06.735 --> 11:08.837
- Why?
- Well, because, you know,

11:08.871 --> 11:10.271
we're still looking at places.

11:10.305 --> 11:11.505
Uh, "we" means "she."

11:11.539 --> 11:13.807
- I sensed that.
- Yeah.

11:13.842 --> 11:14.808
You know what?

11:14.843 --> 11:16.243
This motherfucker had to drag me

11:16.278 --> 11:17.745
kicking and screaming here.

11:17.779 --> 11:19.079
At first, I hated it.

11:19.114 --> 11:21.381
Now I fucking love it.

11:21.416 --> 11:22.749
Okay, what do you love about it?

11:22.784 --> 11:24.618
Everything is fucking fake!

11:24.652 --> 11:26.487
Okay? The houses
are like sets,

11:26.521 --> 11:28.789
and the people are
indistinguishable from actors.

11:28.823 --> 11:29.991
It's awesome.

11:30.025 --> 11:33.028
Hank's career
is about to explode, Karen.

11:46.475 --> 11:47.642
Ah, nice to meet you.

11:47.676 --> 11:49.043
You didn't tell me he was gorgeous.

11:49.077 --> 11:50.745
Well, for you to discover.

11:50.779 --> 11:52.613
It's great to finally meet you, Hank.

11:52.648 --> 11:54.382
- I'm a huge fan.
- No, you're not.

11:54.416 --> 11:56.184
[Laughs] Oh, I'm not, huh?

11:56.218 --> 11:58.686
I am a huge fan, Hank.
I swear.

I love you.
I cannot wait to get started.

12:00.623 --> 12:02.223
Wow, people are very excitable here.

12:02.258 --> 12:03.658
You notice that, Karen?

12:03.693 --> 12:05.193
- Ali, is it?
- Uh-huh.

12:05.228 --> 12:06.194
- This is Karen.
- Hi.

Don't tell her--

12:09.866 --> 12:11.300
And my baby mama.

12:11.335 --> 12:12.335
- Did I cover it?
- [Giggles] Yeah.

12:12.369 --> 12:14.304
- Pretty much?
- Nice to meet you, Ali.

12:14.338 --> 12:15.605
Nice to meet you too.

12:15.639 --> 12:18.408
Hey, could I pull you aside
and buy you a drink?

12:18.442 --> 12:20.010
I know we've got a meeting
on the books for tomorrow,

12:20.044 --> 12:21.845
but I would love
to hit the ground running

12:21.880 --> 12:24.415
and get you up to speed.

12:24.449 --> 12:25.516
Go.

12:25.551 --> 12:26.818
Hit the ground running.

12:26.852 --> 12:28.452
- [Whispering] Get up to speed.
- [Whispering] Okay.

12:28.487 --> 12:29.854
You know how I love jargon.

12:32.190 --> 12:34.324
There's something
you're not telling me.

12:34.359 --> 12:35.959
You're holding out on me, lady.

12:40.097 --> 12:44.666
Because what if I think
the truth makes me a bad person?

12:44.700 --> 12:46.067
Maybe the truth is what you need

12:46.102 --> 12:47.736
to finish this song.

[Clicks tongue]

12:51.140 --> 12:52.674

12:52.708 --> 12:54.309
The night I left for L.A.,

12:54.343 --> 12:56.010
the night that I met you
on the plane...

12:56.045 --> 12:57.078
Mm-hmm.

12:57.112 --> 12:59.580
Me and my ex had one last dinner.

12:59.614 --> 13:01.715
And we'd been arguing a lot, you know.

13:01.750 --> 13:05.486
And, to be honest,
I was happy to leave town.

13:05.520 --> 13:07.955
But that night, he was so sweet.

13:07.990 --> 13:10.592
He was actually the guy
that I had been in love with

13:10.626 --> 13:12.761
for as long as I can remember.

13:12.795 --> 13:15.964
And I wanted to...

13:15.999 --> 13:17.700
stay.

13:17.734 --> 13:20.736
I wanted to be with him.

13:20.770 --> 13:23.138
But then he asked me
if I slept with Samurai.

13:23.173 --> 13:25.340
And I lied.

13:25.375 --> 13:28.643
I told him what he wanted to hear.

13:28.678 --> 13:31.145
And then he pulled a ring out
and asked me to marry him.

13:31.180 --> 13:33.081
Ohh...

13:33.115 --> 13:34.415
What'd you say?

13:34.449 --> 13:36.951
Nothing.

13:39.254 --> 13:40.720
[Scoffs]

13:40.755 --> 13:44.624
I was speechless.

13:44.658 --> 13:46.593
I got up, I went to the bathroom.

13:46.628 --> 13:48.429
I splashed some water on my face.

13:54.570 --> 13:56.471
I slipped out the back,

13:56.506 --> 13:58.073
jumped in a cab,

13:58.107 --> 13:59.975
and went straight to the airport.

14:03.113 --> 14:05.914
Didn't look back.

14:05.949 --> 14:07.649
I knew, if I went back to the table,

14:07.684 --> 14:09.618
I would have said yes.

14:12.422 --> 14:14.356
But...

14:14.390 --> 14:17.158
Then my dreams would never come true.

14:27.536 --> 14:30.537
[Waves crashing, seagulls calling]

14:55.600 --> 14:56.833
Hey, lady.

14:56.868 --> 14:58.001
Come on back to bed.

14:58.035 --> 15:01.171
I found this in your pocket.

15:01.205 --> 15:03.039
- Ali Andrews.
- Ah.

15:03.074 --> 15:04.708
"Please call me anytime."

15:04.742 --> 15:05.943
[Laughs] Come on.
Give me a break, Karen.

15:05.977 --> 15:07.144
- I didn't even look at it.
- Oh, she's a--

15:07.178 --> 15:08.712

15:08.747 --> 15:10.080
You looked like you cared last night.

15:10.115 --> 15:12.249
Well, she was full
of kind words and flattery.

15:12.284 --> 15:13.584
Who doesn't like that sort of thing?

15:13.618 --> 15:14.919
- She's a huge fan.
- What's not to like?

15:14.953 --> 15:16.254
She would totally fuck you.

15:16.288 --> 15:18.590
Yes, and I only want to fuck you.

15:18.624 --> 15:19.591
- So what?
- Yeah, right now.

15:19.625 --> 15:20.859
But that could change, you know.

15:20.893 --> 15:22.727
- L.A. changes people.
- No, no, no.

15:22.762 --> 15:24.830
Cities don't change people.

15:24.864 --> 15:26.531
People don't even change people.

15:26.566 --> 15:28.533
We are who we are.

15:30.469 --> 15:32.703
Do you really think
we're gonna beat the odds?

15:32.738 --> 15:35.740
Fuck the odds.
You know, we make our own odds.

15:37.810 --> 15:39.577
You're incredibly naive.

15:39.611 --> 15:43.014
And you're incredibly incredible.

15:43.048 --> 15:45.616
Not to mention beautiful.

15:45.651 --> 15:47.285
And, after all these years,

Oh, my God,
I'm so not charmed by that.

15:53.526 --> 15:55.060
- That's repulsive.
- No, you are charmed.

16:38.370 --> 16:41.206
I hope so. I mean,
they're beautiful words.

16:41.240 --> 16:43.208
Yeah, but they're just words.

16:43.243 --> 16:44.643
You gotta make the music.

16:44.678 --> 16:47.880
Well, I definitely think
I can make them work.

Do you think you'll ever
make it back to your guy?

17:01.997 --> 17:04.866
I don't know.

17:04.900 --> 17:07.635
I spend a lot of time
going back and forth in my head

17:07.669 --> 17:10.069
about what might have been

17:10.105 --> 17:12.673
and, uh, "just as well."

17:14.309 --> 17:16.377
I know the feeling.

17:16.411 --> 17:18.713
I think that there are
people in your life

17:18.747 --> 17:21.148
who--they inspire art.

17:21.183 --> 17:25.020
You know, and you blow them up
into these mythical characters

17:25.054 --> 17:30.491
and you give them all those
magical qualities.

17:30.526 --> 17:32.059
Or maybe they're just stepping stones

17:32.094 --> 17:33.861
for something bigger and better.

17:33.896 --> 17:36.330
That's a pretty cynical
way to look at things.

17:36.365 --> 17:37.699
Yeah, well, look at you.

17:37.733 --> 17:40.401
I mean, shit, I got
a fuckin' song out of you.

17:58.720 --> 18:01.722
No, I...

on all this heartbreak and champagne.

18:05.528 --> 18:07.495
It's more than that,
and I think you know that.

18:07.530 --> 18:08.963
- I do?
- Mm-hmm.

18:22.678 --> 18:24.112
True dat.

18:24.146 --> 18:25.680
[Chuckles softly]

18:32.955 --> 18:35.523
Or maybe that's what makes it so hot.

18:48.470 --> 18:50.570
[Phone ringing]

18:50.605 --> 18:51.972
Can I get you another water?

18:52.006 --> 18:54.240
Mm.

18:54.275 --> 18:55.475
No, I'm fine.

18:55.509 --> 18:56.809
Yeah, you don't look fine.

18:56.844 --> 18:58.445
How do I look?

18:58.479 --> 19:00.246
- Thunderstruck.
- Mm.

19:00.281 --> 19:01.514
That's a good word.

19:01.548 --> 19:04.150
Look, I know it's a lot to take in.

19:04.184 --> 19:06.018
Maybe I should call Charlie.

19:06.053 --> 19:07.286
Why? What would you say?

19:07.321 --> 19:08.788
I don't think I'd say anything.

19:08.822 --> 19:10.990
I'd just scream.

19:11.024 --> 19:11.991
I understand.

19:12.025 --> 19:13.993
- You do?
- I do.

19:14.027 --> 19:15.260
Your book is brilliant.

19:15.295 --> 19:16.928
And now we're gonna
make it into a movie.

19:16.963 --> 19:18.697
- Mm-hmm.
- But you gotta trust me.

19:18.731 --> 19:20.131
But it's not a romantic comedy.

19:20.166 --> 19:22.166
- I know what I'm doing.
- It's not a romantic comedy.

19:22.201 --> 19:25.470
Your book is deeply romantic
and very funny.

19:25.504 --> 19:27.305
But it's also very dark
and bittersweet.

19:27.339 --> 19:29.808
Mm-hmm, totally.

19:35.482 --> 19:36.582
Mm.

19:36.616 --> 19:38.651
Is this really happening?

19:38.685 --> 19:40.386
- Yes.
- Hmm.

19:40.420 --> 19:43.322
And you're not exactly responding

19:43.357 --> 19:45.858
in the appropriate manner--
what's that about?

19:45.892 --> 19:48.060
Uh, it's about the fact
that my better half

19:48.094 --> 19:50.362
would cut off my dick
if she knew what was going on.

19:50.396 --> 19:52.030
Well, then you probably
shouldn't mention it.

19:52.064 --> 19:53.398
Well, I'm not going to.

19:53.432 --> 19:55.266
She already thinks you're
a woman of ill-repute.

19:55.301 --> 19:56.434
She's right.

19:56.468 --> 19:57.735
I wish I could tell her, though.

19:57.769 --> 19:59.069
She'd be thrilled.

19:59.104 --> 20:01.138
I'm usually telling her
how wrong she is about shit.

20:01.172 --> 20:03.707
How long have you guys been together?

20:03.741 --> 20:06.409
- Do you really care?
- You don't cheat on her?

20:06.443 --> 20:07.877
No.
Am I supposed to?

20:07.912 --> 20:10.414
- None of my business.
- Hmm.

20:10.448 --> 20:13.851
Guess I just misjudged you.

20:13.885 --> 20:15.587
- What does that mean?
- Nothin'.

20:15.621 --> 20:17.589
First draft, 12 weeks.

20:17.623 --> 20:18.623
Is that doable?

20:18.658 --> 20:20.425
I don't see why not.

20:20.460 --> 20:22.327
Great.
Good luck with the writing.

20:22.362 --> 20:24.263
[Intercom bloops] Get me Todd Carr!

20:40.814 --> 20:42.114
[Waves crashing]

20:43.616 --> 20:44.816
How was your meeting?

20:44.851 --> 20:47.619
Kind of a nightmare, actually.

20:47.653 --> 20:51.356
- Did she try to fuck you?
- Of course.

20:51.391 --> 20:53.092
I'm just that irresistible.

20:53.126 --> 20:55.661
I'm like Spanish fly

[Kiss]

20:56.963 --> 20:58.430
Ah.

20:58.464 --> 20:59.865
But it did get me thinkin'.

20:59.899 --> 21:04.003
About...

21:04.037 --> 21:05.804
Let's not and say we did.

21:05.839 --> 21:07.673
What do you mean?

21:07.707 --> 21:10.108
Fuck it.
Fuck this place.

21:10.143 --> 21:12.644
Why mess with a good thing?

21:12.678 --> 21:14.845
You know, "Leave well enough
alone" and other cliches.

21:14.880 --> 21:16.647
Let's stay in New York.

21:16.682 --> 21:18.316
Charlie'll understand.

21:18.350 --> 21:19.516
And if he doesn't,

21:19.551 --> 21:22.786
fuck him <i>and</i> his bald head.

21:22.820 --> 21:23.854
We do have a great life.

We're so lucky.

21:26.090 --> 21:28.092
[Valley girl accent] Totally.

21:28.126 --> 21:29.560
Which is exactly why we should do it.

21:29.594 --> 21:30.628
Yeah.

21:30.662 --> 21:32.997
- What?
- Mm-hmm.

21:36.536 --> 21:38.670
You're in a really
exciting place right now.

21:38.705 --> 21:42.875
I mean, most people don't even
get to where you are.

21:42.909 --> 21:46.112
It's like...the American dream or some shit.

21:46.146 --> 21:48.013
We should just ride the wave

21:48.048 --> 21:50.983
and see where it takes us.

21:51.017 --> 21:52.184
- Are you sure?
- I mean...

21:52.218 --> 21:54.186
Yeah, because as long
as we're together,

21:54.220 --> 21:57.289
who gives a fuck where we live, right?

21:59.358 --> 22:00.591
So...

- Yeah, you are.

22:50.976 --> 22:53.612
But what y'all did,
that's the home run, man.
