00:01.502 --> 00:02.742
<i>Previously on "bates motel"...</i>

00:02.836 --> 00:04.503
Do you think maybe
we could be friends?

00:04.604 --> 00:05.738
Of course.

00:05.839 --> 00:07.119
Like, we could
hang out sometime?

00:07.207 --> 00:08.940
I mean, even though I'm married?

00:09.043 --> 00:10.742
Holy shit.

00:10.845 --> 00:12.010
Well, now you know, chick.

00:12.113 --> 00:14.012
Can you keep this secret
about me?

00:14.114 --> 00:15.247
Can I trust you, chick?

00:15.348 --> 00:16.415
Hey, norma?

00:16.516 --> 00:18.416
Can I stay here
for a little while?

00:18.518 --> 00:19.851
Oof!

00:19.954 --> 00:21.452
Back up. Back up.

00:21.555 --> 00:23.588
What are you doing?
You trying to steal our car?

00:23.690 --> 00:25.130
You don't need to do it.
I'll just...

00:26.626 --> 00:27.860
Mother?

00:27.961 --> 00:29.006
I need you to do
something for me.

00:29.030 --> 00:30.195
<i>I need you to kill him.</i>

00:30.297 --> 00:31.463
I want you to leave.

00:31.565 --> 00:32.463
And never come back.

00:32.567 --> 00:33.865
Go!

00:33.968 --> 00:35.433
<i>Go! - Norman!</i>

00:35.569 --> 00:37.203
He will ruin us!

00:40.207 --> 00:41.873
Hey!

01:06.499 --> 01:09.468
Yup.

01:13.874 --> 01:15.441
I'm so sorry.

01:17.444 --> 01:20.144
It's okay.

01:20.248 --> 01:21.512
Is what it is.

01:23.683 --> 01:25.416
He didn't ever need
to come back here.

01:25.518 --> 01:27.785
He didn't ever need
to do a lot of stuff.

01:31.224 --> 01:32.523
Let's just get rid of the body.

01:36.697 --> 01:37.963
Well...

01:38.064 --> 01:39.999
Shouldn't we call the sheriff?

01:40.100 --> 01:41.466
I mean, it was an accident, so...

01:41.569 --> 01:42.569
Jeez.

01:42.602 --> 01:44.303
No, I-i d...

01:44.404 --> 01:45.684
I don't think that's
a good idea.

01:45.773 --> 01:47.338
I agree with him.

01:47.440 --> 01:49.107
Okay, well, I'm glad
that you two agree,

01:49.209 --> 01:51.709
But I think we should
call the police, okay?

01:51.811 --> 01:53.811
We've... have done
nothing wrong here.

01:53.915 --> 01:55.880
He just ran out on the road,
got hit...

01:55.982 --> 01:57.482
We... there... no one is at fault.

01:57.584 --> 01:59.817
I... l... look, I beg to differ.

01:59.921 --> 02:01.286
It's all my fault.

02:01.388 --> 02:02.720
I was driving the car.

02:02.822 --> 02:04.856
Look, he was locked up
in the basement.

02:04.958 --> 02:07.326
There's things that
they could find out.

02:07.428 --> 02:09.327
What things?

02:09.396 --> 02:13.666
He was
chained up in your basement.

02:13.767 --> 02:17.303
There are other things
in your basement.

02:17.404 --> 02:19.704
I agree, there are lots
of secrets...

02:19.806 --> 02:21.083
I... Me being alive one of them.

02:21.107 --> 02:23.007
So we don't want cops
sniffing around.

02:25.279 --> 02:26.477
I can get rid of the body.

02:26.579 --> 02:27.812
Just help me pick it up.

02:29.816 --> 02:31.450
Help him pick it up.

02:46.032 --> 02:47.266
All right.

02:47.368 --> 02:49.201
I'll take care of it.

02:49.269 --> 02:51.536
It's gonna take me a while,
though, so don't wait up.

02:54.874 --> 02:56.575
There's the groceries.

02:56.677 --> 02:58.944
Don't make the chicken.

02:59.046 --> 03:00.912
I want to make it when
I get back for dinner.

03:08.788 --> 03:09.954
You shot me.

03:12.025 --> 03:13.225
Hey, hold... no.

03:13.326 --> 03:14.392
Easy, easy, easy.

03:14.494 --> 03:15.793
Easy, now, let's...

03:15.895 --> 03:17.395
Let's not have another accident.

03:17.498 --> 03:19.797
Come on, put it down.
Put it down.

03:19.899 --> 03:22.468
Hey, this is a very serious
thing you've done.

03:22.570 --> 03:23.969
Put it down.

03:28.809 --> 03:30.274
That your house?

03:32.012 --> 03:33.212
Yeah.

03:33.314 --> 03:34.645
Go inside.

03:34.749 --> 03:36.447
Get... get...

03:36.549 --> 03:39.317
A first-aid kit or some bandages.

03:39.419 --> 03:41.153
Or anything like that,
and bring it to me,

03:41.255 --> 03:43.054
But don't let anybody see you.

03:43.156 --> 03:45.556
Listen, I know you didn't
mean to hurt me.

03:45.659 --> 03:47.499
I... i know it was just
an accident, all right?

03:47.561 --> 03:50.728
I won't say a word about it
if you won't.

03:50.831 --> 03:52.431
Promise? Yes.

03:52.532 --> 03:54.066
Yes. Now do as I say, okay?

03:54.167 --> 03:55.299
Go.

06:10.804 --> 06:12.271
Morning, sheriff. Hey, regina.

06:12.373 --> 06:14.406
How'd your mom's surgery go?

06:14.508 --> 06:17.376
It's been hard,
but she's determined.

06:17.478 --> 06:19.244
Thanks for asking. Yeah.

06:19.346 --> 06:20.786
I put in the quarterly
stats for you.

06:20.848 --> 06:22.608
They are on your desk.
Down again this month.

06:22.683 --> 06:23.916
Thanks.

06:24.018 --> 06:26.285
White pine bay
sheriff's station.

06:26.387 --> 06:28.153
Sheriff?

06:29.757 --> 06:32.324
It's the da. Says it's urgent.

06:32.425 --> 06:33.825
Put him through.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.900
What time is it?

06:42.002 --> 06:44.102
It's 10:30 now.

06:44.204 --> 06:45.437
You slept in.

06:45.538 --> 06:47.573
Well, must've been tired.

06:47.675 --> 06:48.740
Must've been.

06:48.841 --> 06:51.410
Can't imagine why.

06:51.512 --> 06:52.844
Why do you have my dresses?

06:52.947 --> 06:54.913
Because you've had them
forever, mother,

06:55.014 --> 06:57.816
For years, and look...
Still the same old dresses.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.918
What the hell crawled
into your pants?

07:00.020 --> 07:02.087
I don't like how things are.

07:03.958 --> 07:06.425
Well, neither does all
of anyone in god's creation.

07:06.526 --> 07:07.737
We are a species of complainers.

07:07.761 --> 07:08.838
What makes today so special?

07:08.862 --> 07:10.028
Because nothing ever happens.

07:10.130 --> 07:12.798
The way that I think
it should, mother.

07:14.201 --> 07:15.634
I wanted caleb to go,

07:15.736 --> 07:17.536
But, no, he goes and gets
hit in the street.

07:17.638 --> 07:19.004
And I wanted to call the cops,

07:19.106 --> 07:20.639
But, no, you and chick decide.

07:20.740 --> 07:22.452
That it's better to go
and get rid of a body.

07:22.476 --> 07:24.087
You know, I don't want to be
getting rid of bodies.

07:24.111 --> 07:25.978
Or have people chained up
in my basement.

07:26.079 --> 07:27.779
Or dump people in lakes.

07:30.150 --> 07:33.085
And since when are you and chick
such great friends?

07:33.187 --> 07:35.687
You're the one who invited him
here in the first place.

07:37.992 --> 07:39.358
And you know what?
You are right.

07:39.460 --> 07:42.227
I am tired of these dresses.
Get rid of 'em.

07:42.329 --> 07:44.796
I'm gonna go online and order
a bunch of new clothes.

07:44.898 --> 07:47.132
Dead or not, I can't be prancing
around the house naked.

07:47.234 --> 07:49.534
You don't like your
old dresses anymore?

07:49.637 --> 07:51.036
Make up your mind.

07:51.138 --> 07:53.071
Do I like them, or do
I not like them?

07:58.478 --> 08:00.212
No, I'll get it.

08:05.853 --> 08:07.318
Yeah, coming.

08:13.127 --> 08:14.659
Hi.

08:14.762 --> 08:17.029
I'm... i'm sheriff greene.

08:17.130 --> 08:18.496
We haven't met formally,

08:18.599 --> 08:19.998
But I've seen you in town.

08:20.100 --> 08:21.700
You're norman bates, right?

08:21.802 --> 08:24.769
Yes, nice to finally meet you.

08:24.871 --> 08:26.538
I would've invited you in.

08:26.639 --> 08:27.739
Just...

08:27.841 --> 08:29.240
Doing some cleaning.

08:29.342 --> 08:31.209
It's... god, it's frustrating,
you know?

08:31.312 --> 08:32.878
Just gets so cluttered,

08:32.980 --> 08:34.256
You don't know what
you have anymore.

08:34.280 --> 08:36.181
Yeah, we all have
too much stuff.

08:38.351 --> 08:40.085
I wanted to ask you
about something.

08:40.187 --> 08:41.787
Yes, of... of course.

08:41.889 --> 08:45.691
A man named jim blackwell has
skipped out on his parole.

08:45.793 --> 08:47.759
His parole officer found
your address.

08:47.861 --> 08:50.128
Written down on a piece
of paper at his place.

08:50.230 --> 08:51.763
Have you seen him?

08:51.865 --> 08:53.764
Jim black... blackwell?

08:53.866 --> 08:57.101
Blackwell... No. No...

08:57.204 --> 08:59.971
I've never heard of anyone
named jim blackwell.

09:01.741 --> 09:03.709
Well, I'm not so worried.

09:03.811 --> 09:05.277
About a guy skipping parole.

09:05.379 --> 09:06.712
I mean, I am worried,

09:06.813 --> 09:08.714
But it's not why I'm here.

09:08.816 --> 09:11.649
I-I'm worried because he
was recently released.

09:11.752 --> 09:13.051
From the same prison.

09:13.153 --> 09:15.654
Where alex romero was
serving his time.

09:17.758 --> 09:20.091
W-w-was?

09:20.193 --> 09:22.928
Yeah, I got a call from
the da this morning.

09:23.029 --> 09:24.763
Romero escaped.

09:30.003 --> 09:31.336
Has he contacted you?

09:33.207 --> 09:34.505
No, n...

09:34.608 --> 09:36.108
No, it's just... it's not that.

09:36.210 --> 09:38.243
I just don't...
I just don't like him.

09:38.345 --> 09:40.111
He put too much pressure
on my mother,

09:40.214 --> 09:43.014
And I feel that's
what led to her death.

09:45.351 --> 09:49.520
Well, what concerns me
is the timing here.

09:49.623 --> 09:52.323
Blackwell gets out of prison...

09:52.426 --> 09:54.125
Has your address.

09:54.228 --> 09:56.794
Shortly after that,
romero escapes.

09:56.897 --> 09:59.931
Why would a guy who had every
chance of getting out of prison.

10:00.033 --> 10:02.534
After two years doing easy time
on a work farm.

10:02.635 --> 10:04.336
Risk escaping?

10:05.773 --> 10:07.873
Had to be something
worth it out here.

10:09.409 --> 10:11.308
M-might be here in your house,

10:11.412 --> 10:12.943
And you don't know it.

10:13.046 --> 10:15.614
Might be something jim blackwell
found out about...

10:15.716 --> 10:18.183
Why he was around here
before he disappeared.

10:18.284 --> 10:21.019
Y-you mean here...
In... in this house?

10:21.120 --> 10:22.287
Yeah, or the motel.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.368
No, there's nothing
in these structures

10:25.392 --> 10:27.793
I don't know about, sheriff.

10:29.730 --> 10:31.140
You just said you have
so much clutter,

10:31.164 --> 10:32.663
You don't know what you have.

10:32.765 --> 10:35.300
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

10:35.402 --> 10:36.567
I guess I did, but it...

10:36.669 --> 10:38.803
I know that it's all my stuff.

10:40.240 --> 10:43.175
Well, now you know
what's going on.

10:43.277 --> 10:44.397
If you see anything unusual,

10:44.445 --> 10:46.244
Give me a call.

10:46.346 --> 10:48.046
I... i will. I will do...

10:48.148 --> 10:49.148
ca...

10:52.919 --> 10:54.853
And...

10:54.955 --> 10:56.688
Do let me know if you.

10:56.789 --> 10:59.390
Happen to hear anything
about romero.

10:59.493 --> 11:00.659
Will do, norman.

11:00.760 --> 11:02.127
Nice to finally meet you.

11:10.837 --> 11:12.036
Who was it?

11:12.139 --> 11:14.239
It was the new sheriff.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.474
Sheriff greene,
I think her name is.

11:16.576 --> 11:18.276
What the hell
does she want with us?

11:20.347 --> 11:23.314
She was asking
about jim blackwell...

11:23.416 --> 11:25.283
If we'd seen him.

11:25.385 --> 11:27.318
He skipped parole.

11:27.420 --> 11:28.953
I bet he did.

11:29.055 --> 11:31.456
Apparently he had
the motel address.

11:31.558 --> 11:32.657
With his things.

11:35.762 --> 11:38.296
I know.

11:38.398 --> 11:40.732
I know; This is exactly
what I mean, mother...

11:40.834 --> 11:43.234
Why I'm upset... because you just
decide things are best.

11:43.336 --> 11:45.069
And don't include me
in the decision,

11:45.172 --> 11:47.183
When I'm really not sure
you know what's best at all.

11:47.207 --> 11:50.942
So I should've just let
jim blackwell kill you?

11:51.044 --> 11:52.243
Maybe.

11:52.345 --> 11:53.945
That's depressing.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.780
No, you know what's
depressing, mother,

11:55.882 --> 11:58.082
Is having no control
over your own life...

11:58.185 --> 12:00.285
Over these decisions
that are being made.

12:00.387 --> 12:01.786
Supposedly on your behalf.

12:01.888 --> 12:03.288
Fine, I'll just wait till.

12:03.390 --> 12:04.756
You're out of your next blackout.

12:04.858 --> 12:07.192
To make a move on anything.

12:07.294 --> 12:08.493
I don't like this, mother.

12:11.131 --> 12:12.964
I don't like how we've
become lately.

12:13.066 --> 12:15.033
People fight, sweetheart.

12:15.135 --> 12:16.801
It's not the end of the world.

12:19.072 --> 12:21.472
So jim blackwell had
the motel address.

12:21.575 --> 12:23.335
He could've been looking
for a place to stay.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.810
They can't prove anything.

12:25.912 --> 12:27.212
Did she say anything else?

12:28.915 --> 12:30.982
No.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.617
Nothing else.

12:35.722 --> 12:37.555
I'll be back in a few hours.

13:26.473 --> 13:28.273
Hey.

13:28.375 --> 13:29.607
Hi.

13:29.709 --> 13:31.843
Look at you, in here
all by yourself.

13:31.945 --> 13:33.077
What's going on?

13:34.648 --> 13:36.347
Nothing much.

13:36.449 --> 13:38.783
Are you okay?

13:38.885 --> 13:41.619
Yeah, yeah, just...

13:41.721 --> 13:44.622
Had some trouble sleeping.

13:44.724 --> 13:47.692
Are you sure?

13:47.794 --> 13:50.762
Nothing a few new
shower curtains can't fix.

13:50.864 --> 13:52.297
Your order, right.

13:52.399 --> 13:55.066
It... it came in last night.

13:55.168 --> 13:56.701
I'll go get it from the back.

13:56.803 --> 13:58.236
Thank you.

13:58.338 --> 14:00.038
Man, you are a life-saver.

14:00.140 --> 14:02.440
I can imagine you go through
a lot of these.

14:02.542 --> 14:06.778
Yes, yes, we... we do, actually.

14:06.880 --> 14:10.315
They don't really last
too long, you know?

14:10.417 --> 14:11.582
Yeah.

14:11.685 --> 14:14.252
So I, um...

14:14.354 --> 14:16.988
I was just cl... i've been
cleaning out the house,

14:17.090 --> 14:18.868
Just trying to get rid
of a bunch of old stuff,

14:18.892 --> 14:20.825
And...

14:20.927 --> 14:22.660
This is gonna sound
really weird,

14:22.762 --> 14:25.563
But I was just about to donate
a bunch of my mother's dresses,

14:25.665 --> 14:27.398
And I've got no use
for them anymore.

14:27.500 --> 14:30.001
But I just felt bad
putting them in the bin,

14:30.103 --> 14:32.136
And so I wondered if I could
give them to you.

14:34.274 --> 14:36.441
I... i just feel like you'd.

14:36.543 --> 14:38.810
Take care of them and wear them,

14:38.912 --> 14:41.512
Like they wouldn't be something
unanimated anymore.

14:47.754 --> 14:49.320
What did I do?

14:49.422 --> 14:51.322
Y-you didn't do anything.

14:51.424 --> 14:53.925
It's just... it's, too weird.

14:54.027 --> 14:55.927
I'm offering you my
dead mother's clothes.

14:56.029 --> 14:57.962
God, I must be going mad.

14:59.299 --> 15:01.466
Just so you know, my...

15:01.568 --> 15:04.302
Mother was not like other moms.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.615
She wasn't what you think of
when you think of mom clothes.

15:06.639 --> 15:11.476
She was youthful and beautiful
and vibrant.

15:14.447 --> 15:16.881
Hi, welcome to village hardware.

15:16.983 --> 15:19.217
Hi. Thanks.
Could you help me with these?

15:19.319 --> 15:20.685
Yeah, I'll be right there.

15:20.787 --> 15:22.387
Um...

15:22.489 --> 15:23.855
Why don't you leave these here,

15:23.957 --> 15:25.234
And I'll go through them
tonight?

15:25.258 --> 15:26.824
Is that okay? Yeah.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.604
I promise I'll take
really good care of them.

15:28.628 --> 15:29.727
I know you will.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.280
It looks like you
could use a hand.

15:38.304 --> 15:39.615
Do you want me to hold her
while you shop?

15:39.639 --> 15:41.672
You don't mind? Not at all.

15:41.775 --> 15:43.040
Hi.

15:43.143 --> 15:44.308
What's her name?

15:44.411 --> 15:45.643
Rose.

15:45.745 --> 15:47.011
Hi, rose.

15:48.515 --> 15:50.815
What a pretty name.

16:18.211 --> 16:20.278
It went glorious,

16:20.380 --> 16:22.213
Even by my own standards.

16:22.315 --> 16:23.915
I brought some of my things,

16:24.017 --> 16:26.451
So you mind if I stay
in dylan's room,

16:26.553 --> 16:29.120
Or should I crash on the couch...

16:29.222 --> 16:31.722
Maybe we should talk, chick.

16:31.825 --> 16:34.192
Yeah, we got plenty
of time to talk.

16:34.294 --> 16:35.460
Let's talk inside.

16:35.562 --> 16:36.894
No, no, I like it here.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.233
All right.

16:42.335 --> 16:46.270
Just let me put my bird down.

16:46.372 --> 16:47.605
Fire away, champ.

16:49.042 --> 16:50.541
The thing is, I just...

16:50.643 --> 16:52.483
Don't think you should
spend so much time here.

16:58.485 --> 17:00.751
I mean, it's... it's...

17:00.854 --> 17:01.986
It's me, you know.

17:02.088 --> 17:04.121
It's just too much with...

17:04.223 --> 17:06.624
Mother and all, and...

17:06.726 --> 17:10.127
To bring one more person
into this is...

17:10.230 --> 17:11.596
One more person.

17:13.333 --> 17:15.665
I don't think there's
much of a problem, though.

17:15.768 --> 17:18.769
I mean, your mother still
likes me, so...

17:18.872 --> 17:20.883
Yeah... no, she... she likes
you. Of course she does.

17:20.906 --> 17:22.138
And I like you too.

17:22.242 --> 17:23.608
We both like you, chick.

17:23.710 --> 17:24.909
Not about that. It's...

17:25.011 --> 17:26.676
Then what's it about?

17:28.548 --> 17:31.315
I'm gonna help you out with
a lot of things, norman.

17:31.417 --> 17:33.684
Help you out with everything...

17:33.786 --> 17:35.186
Everything.

17:38.758 --> 17:40.157
I understand, chick.

17:41.928 --> 17:44.996
And as I said, I appreciate it.

17:45.098 --> 17:47.538
And I'm by no means saying that
we can't still see each other.

17:47.567 --> 17:49.367
What I'm saying is,
not every day.

17:52.372 --> 17:53.938
Okay? You can't live here.

18:00.246 --> 18:01.812
Can I still come over? Yeah.

18:01.915 --> 18:04.048
Can I come over tomorrow?
No, not tomorrow.

18:04.150 --> 18:05.650
Maybe the next day.

18:05.752 --> 18:07.096
I can bring quail.
We can cook up...

18:07.120 --> 18:09.287
No, not that day either.

18:09.389 --> 18:12.623
Yeah, I get it.

18:12.725 --> 18:14.058
I get it.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.397
Maybe some night
next week, chick.

18:19.499 --> 18:22.133
Yeah. Yeah.

18:22.235 --> 18:23.634
Next week.

18:23.736 --> 18:26.203
Let me just clear my calendar.

18:26.306 --> 18:27.872
You might want to cook up
that chicken.

18:27.974 --> 18:29.373
That I brought over last night.

18:29.475 --> 18:31.709
375, 45 minutes,

18:31.811 --> 18:33.711
Or it goes bad.

18:33.813 --> 18:35.313
Goes real bad.

19:22.528 --> 19:23.961
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

19:24.063 --> 19:25.963
Yeah, my... my name's ben hayes.

19:26.065 --> 19:28.699
I live at 3043270th street.

19:28.801 --> 19:31.302
W-we need an ambulance.
My neighbor od'd.

19:31.404 --> 19:32.803
It's apartment 221.

19:32.905 --> 19:34.805
Hurry, please... please hurry.

21:52.478 --> 21:54.645
Hello, norman.

21:54.747 --> 21:57.047
Pretty night, isn't it?

21:57.149 --> 21:59.283
Yes. Yes, sheriff.

21:59.385 --> 22:00.951
Isn't it just?

22:01.053 --> 22:04.622
So, w-what can I
help you with tonight?

22:04.724 --> 22:06.724
I imagine you're not
looking for a room.

22:06.826 --> 22:10.794
I was wondering if you keep
a guest registry...

22:10.896 --> 22:13.731
The old-fashioned kind where
people sign their names?

22:15.568 --> 22:17.668
Yes. Yes, we... we do, actually.

22:17.770 --> 22:19.903
Um, w-why?

22:20.006 --> 22:22.539
I wondered if I might
have a look at it.

22:24.176 --> 22:25.709
Yeah.

22:25.811 --> 22:27.711
Yeah, of... of course.

22:27.813 --> 22:30.514
I was just closing up,
but come on in.

22:46.332 --> 22:47.831
So who are you looking for?

22:47.933 --> 22:52.736
Still wondering why jim
blackwell had this address.

22:52.838 --> 22:55.239
I wondered if he...

22:55.341 --> 22:57.608
Checked in under a false name.

23:05.184 --> 23:08.719
I know. It seems silly, right?

23:08.821 --> 23:11.789
A lot of police work is silly...

23:11.891 --> 23:13.524
Till you find what
you're looking for.

23:16.028 --> 23:18.962
And then all of a sudden
it's not so silly anymore.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.966
Yeah, well, we get
people in here.

23:23.069 --> 23:24.568
From canyon city all the time,

23:24.670 --> 23:26.203
So maybe he was just thinking.

23:26.305 --> 23:29.640
Of staying here and then just
changed his mind.

23:29.742 --> 23:32.776
You know, sheriff,
if I were an ex-con,

23:32.878 --> 23:35.279
I'd write down an address
I know you'd find,

23:35.381 --> 23:39.616
And then take on off in
the opposite direction.

23:39.719 --> 23:42.453
How did you know blackwell
lived in canyon city?

23:44.023 --> 23:45.622
Well, you...

23:45.725 --> 23:47.257
You mentioned it.

23:47.360 --> 23:48.625
The last time you were here.

23:48.728 --> 23:50.127
Did I?

23:51.897 --> 23:53.297
Yes.

23:53.399 --> 23:55.165
Yes, i... i r-r-r-remember now.

23:55.267 --> 23:57.468
You were, um,

23:57.570 --> 23:59.136
Up there on the porch,

23:59.238 --> 24:01.772
And you said that you found
a piece of paper.

24:01.874 --> 24:03.240
With my address on it.

24:03.342 --> 24:04.775
At his place in canyon city.

24:10.082 --> 24:12.649
You haven't seen an early '90s.

24:12.752 --> 24:14.852
Silver and black lincoln,
have you?

24:18.791 --> 24:19.957
N... No.

24:20.059 --> 24:23.127
No, not... not as I recall.

24:23.229 --> 24:24.995
That's what he was driving.

24:25.097 --> 24:26.263
I see.

24:28.934 --> 24:30.667
This is the plate number...

24:34.974 --> 24:38.709
In case you do see it.

24:38.811 --> 24:42.246
Thank you.
I'll keep my eyes peeled.

24:47.586 --> 24:49.286
Well, I'll let you
get back to work.

24:51.123 --> 24:52.756
Okay.

25:00.833 --> 25:02.366
Good night.

25:02.468 --> 25:04.902
Good night.

25:05.004 --> 25:06.970
Looking forward to seeing you
again, norman.

25:26.358 --> 25:27.524
Mother?

25:27.626 --> 25:29.760
Yeah?

25:29.862 --> 25:31.328
Mother!

25:31.430 --> 25:32.729
What?

25:34.366 --> 25:36.233
Was jim blackwell driving a car?

25:38.003 --> 25:39.269
Yes.

25:39.371 --> 25:41.672
A '90s silver and black lincoln?

25:41.774 --> 25:43.073
Maybe.

25:43.175 --> 25:44.615
Okay, well, where
is the car, mother?

25:44.710 --> 25:46.076
The sheriff was just here.

25:46.178 --> 25:47.378
They're searching for the car.

25:47.446 --> 25:49.179
So what did you do with it?

25:49.281 --> 25:51.181
Don't worry.
I hid it in the woods.

25:51.283 --> 25:53.083
The woods?

25:53.185 --> 25:54.885
Is... is it near us?

25:54.987 --> 25:57.187
It's far enough.

25:57.289 --> 26:00.123
Okay, mother, get up.

26:00.226 --> 26:01.758
We are going to that car.

26:01.861 --> 26:03.371
Why, so you could be seen
in the vicinity of it.

26:03.395 --> 26:04.595
And get caught?

26:04.697 --> 26:06.263
No, because we need
to get rid of it.

26:06.365 --> 26:08.109
In a better way than just
leaving it in the woods.

26:08.133 --> 26:10.400
Like the remains of a pie
we didn't eat at a picnic.

26:13.739 --> 26:15.539
We're going.

26:15.641 --> 26:16.874
Now.

26:19.712 --> 26:21.812
This is stupid, norman.

26:21.914 --> 26:24.815
Everything's fine.
I took care of it.

26:24.917 --> 26:26.817
The car is deep in here
somewhere.

26:26.919 --> 26:28.619
Where I know there's
no foot traffic.

26:28.721 --> 26:30.787
No one's gonna find it.
We can't even find it!

26:30.890 --> 26:32.923
That's exactly why we need
to find it, mother.

26:33.025 --> 26:35.158
You really don't know what
you're doing, do you?

26:35.261 --> 26:36.493
Yo, buddy.

26:39.899 --> 26:41.098
I took off the plates.

26:41.200 --> 26:42.633
I scratched off the vin number.

26:42.735 --> 26:45.302
I wiped the whole thing
down for fingerprints.

26:45.404 --> 26:46.637
I covered the car with brush,

26:46.739 --> 26:48.305
And I covered my tracks
on the way back.

26:48.407 --> 26:50.507
No one is gonna find this car,
and even if they do,

26:50.609 --> 26:52.409
They can't trace it back to us.

26:52.511 --> 26:53.810
How do you know all of that?

26:53.913 --> 26:56.146
It's not rocket science.

26:56.248 --> 26:58.015
There it is.

27:00.619 --> 27:02.419
I think we should move it.

27:02.521 --> 27:04.488
Just get rid of it...
Make it disappear.

27:05.624 --> 27:06.957
Well, good luck with that.

27:10.229 --> 27:12.529
Do you remember when
the police found keith's truck.

27:12.631 --> 27:14.197
Near our property, mother?

27:14.300 --> 27:17.034
No, w-we can't risk it.

27:17.136 --> 27:18.435
You are overreacting.

27:18.537 --> 27:20.504
We are miles from the motel,

27:20.606 --> 27:22.306
And no one's found it so far.

27:22.408 --> 27:23.919
That's because no one's been
looking for it, mother,

27:23.943 --> 27:25.475
And now they are.

27:26.779 --> 27:28.178
Where's the key?

27:28.280 --> 27:29.513
I threw it away.

27:29.615 --> 27:31.448
Why would you do that?

27:31.550 --> 27:32.950
Why wouldn't I?

27:33.052 --> 27:34.685
Well, do you know how
to hotwire a car?

27:34.787 --> 27:35.852
Of course I don't.

27:35.955 --> 27:36.853
I don't know why you don't.

27:36.956 --> 27:39.222
Care more about this, mother.

27:39.325 --> 27:40.991
Maybe you want us to get caught.

27:41.093 --> 27:43.226
Yeah, I'm the one who
wants us to get caught.

27:43.329 --> 27:45.329
Yeah, I'm the one who catapulted
us out of bed.

27:45.431 --> 27:46.730
And onto a crime scene.

27:46.832 --> 27:48.665
Or maybe you're just
sick of me, mother.

27:48.767 --> 27:52.135
Maybe you're just sick
of this whole situation.

27:52.237 --> 27:55.038
Maybe you wish it had
worked out with romero.

27:55.140 --> 27:56.540
Maybe you even think
it still could.

27:56.575 --> 27:57.874
Yeah, you know, you're right.

27:57.977 --> 27:59.676
I just wanted to get us caught,

27:59.778 --> 28:01.812
And I wanted to run off
with romero.

28:01.914 --> 28:03.558
I mean, that's why
I've done all of this, wh...

28:03.582 --> 28:06.850
That's why I've protected
your ass 24/7,

28:06.952 --> 28:08.085
Just so I could get caught.

28:08.187 --> 28:09.486
Okay, okay, mother.

28:09.588 --> 28:11.355
Well done. You can stop now.

28:11.457 --> 28:12.723
All right, you know what?

28:12.825 --> 28:14.591
Come and find us!

28:14.693 --> 28:16.259
Mother? We're right here!

28:16.362 --> 28:18.228
Put us in prison, please!

28:18.330 --> 28:19.763
We've been lying
about everything!

28:19.865 --> 28:21.031
Mother... okay?

28:21.133 --> 28:22.366
I'm not really dead!

28:22.468 --> 28:23.934
I just faked my suicide!

28:24.036 --> 28:25.869
I know, bad idea. We want out!

28:25.971 --> 28:27.904
My name is norma bates! Mother!

28:28.007 --> 28:29.773
And I'm still alive!

28:49.161 --> 28:51.361
Mother?

29:12.317 --> 29:14.384
What's really going on
here, norman?

29:16.021 --> 29:18.255
Why are you annoyed
with me lately?

29:18.357 --> 29:20.223
Why can't I do anything
right in your eyes?

29:20.325 --> 29:23.460
I'm sorry, mother.
You were right.

29:23.562 --> 29:24.802
You were right; The car's fine.

29:24.863 --> 29:26.930
Let's just leave it and go home.

29:27.032 --> 29:28.532
Forget about all this, okay?

29:34.740 --> 29:37.407
Don't ever do that to me again.

29:37.509 --> 29:38.642
I won't.

29:47.419 --> 29:48.585
Are you coming?

29:50.789 --> 29:52.089
Right behind you.

30:35.167 --> 30:36.333
Hello?

30:36.435 --> 30:39.436
<i>Hey, norman. How are you?</i>

30:39.538 --> 30:41.805
Hey, good. Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

30:41.907 --> 30:44.341
Why are you whispering?

30:44.443 --> 30:46.977
No, I, um...

30:47.079 --> 30:49.646
I just... just woke up.

30:49.748 --> 30:52.616
<i>Hey, I just wanted to thank
you so much for the dresses.</i>

30:52.718 --> 30:55.018
It's kind of crazy.
They fit perfectly.

30:55.120 --> 30:57.520
And I absolutely love them.

30:57.623 --> 30:58.989
I-I'm so glad.

30:59.091 --> 31:01.825
<i>Yeah, and I get such
a vibe off them,</i>

31:01.927 --> 31:05.195
Of your mom...
What a cool lady she was.

31:05.297 --> 31:06.830
She had great taste.

31:08.300 --> 31:10.934
Yes, she... she certainly did.

31:13.939 --> 31:18.441
Um, hey, do you want to come
over for dinner tonight?

31:18.543 --> 31:21.544
Sam's gone again, and I just
get super bored at night, and...

31:21.647 --> 31:23.446
<i>I think I need to get a dog.</i>

31:26.318 --> 31:28.184
Tonight?

31:28.287 --> 31:29.853
Yeah...

31:29.955 --> 31:32.289
<i>Yeah, I-i'd love to come over.
What time?</i>

31:32.391 --> 31:34.824
Um, maybe 7:00?

31:34.926 --> 31:36.393
7:00, yeah, yeah.

31:36.495 --> 31:38.161
Yeah, that's, um...

31:38.263 --> 31:39.462
That... that can work.

31:39.564 --> 31:40.964
Okay, that sounds great.

31:41.066 --> 31:43.333
I'll see you then.

31:43.435 --> 31:45.635
All... all right, yeah, 7:00.

31:45.737 --> 31:47.337
<i>Bye. - Okay, bye.</i>

32:39.858 --> 32:42.092
Well, well, well.

32:42.194 --> 32:46.196
Look what the tide washed up.

32:46.298 --> 32:48.865
Thought you didn't want
to hang out anymore.

32:48.967 --> 32:51.634
No, no, I never
said that, chick.

32:51.737 --> 32:53.870
I think you're just
overreacting.

32:55.240 --> 32:56.973
Can I come in?

32:57.075 --> 32:58.308
Okay...

32:59.978 --> 33:01.378
Wipe your feet.

33:05.083 --> 33:08.451
Sorry, I didn't have
time to tidy up.

33:10.255 --> 33:12.655
I've been working on something.

33:12.758 --> 33:14.724
Really?
What... what are you working on?

33:14.826 --> 33:19.062
I'm working on a suspense novel.

33:19.164 --> 33:21.004
I think in the right hands,
when it's complete,

33:21.066 --> 33:24.267
It'll make quite
a good little movie.

33:24.369 --> 33:26.002
Can I... can I sit down, chick?

33:29.841 --> 33:32.175
Mess my system up.

33:32.277 --> 33:35.745
Yeah, I just, need to ask
your advice about something.

33:35.847 --> 33:38.314
Yeah, I figured you
were here for something.

33:38.417 --> 33:40.250
Chick.

33:40.352 --> 33:42.619
Come on, just because I said
we can't live together,

33:42.721 --> 33:44.988
It doesn't mean we still
can't be friends, right?

33:45.090 --> 33:46.856
What do you want, norman?

33:50.529 --> 33:53.696
Chick...

33:53.799 --> 33:57.767
Do you know how
to hotwire a car?

33:57.869 --> 33:59.436
Yeah.

33:59.538 --> 34:01.104
I do.

34:01.206 --> 34:03.606
And do you know how to, g...

34:03.708 --> 34:06.876
You know, get...
Get rid of a car?

34:06.978 --> 34:10.580
I've just heard of these things
called "chop shops."

34:10.681 --> 34:12.849
And... Do you know
of any such places?

34:15.654 --> 34:17.487
What did you do?

34:19.324 --> 34:20.556
Nothing, just...

34:20.659 --> 34:23.159
I just want to get rid
of a car, chick.

34:23.261 --> 34:26.963
Well, that seems like
an unnecessarily elaborate way.

34:27.065 --> 34:28.797
To just get rid of a car.

34:28.900 --> 34:31.501
Well, that's...
What I'm going to be doing.

34:33.304 --> 34:34.985
And that's all I'm going
to tell you, so...

34:38.944 --> 34:40.643
Yeah.

34:40.745 --> 34:43.545
All right, I'll just figure
it out on my own.

34:43.648 --> 34:46.649
Yeah, I know a place.

34:46.751 --> 34:49.351
I know a guy with
a place and a thing.

34:50.822 --> 34:52.722
But I need to know something.

34:52.824 --> 34:55.658
I need to know what
you did, norman.

35:03.702 --> 35:06.703
It's not me, chick.

35:06.805 --> 35:08.204
It is her...

35:09.841 --> 35:12.041
Mother.

35:12.143 --> 35:13.409
How do you mean?

35:15.347 --> 35:17.413
Well, she's just out
of control, chick.

35:19.784 --> 35:22.418
I-I mean, sh... She thinks
that she knows what's...

35:22.521 --> 35:25.955
Is best about everything,
but she does not.

35:26.057 --> 35:29.058
I mean, just look what
happened with caleb.

35:29.160 --> 35:31.394
Yeah, yeah, I see.

35:32.964 --> 35:35.398
I mean, there is something.

35:35.500 --> 35:38.434
Very, very wrong with her.

35:38.537 --> 35:40.670
And then I've tried to help,

35:40.739 --> 35:44.541
But, I mean, she's...
Chick, she's going to ruin us.

35:44.643 --> 35:46.609
If I don't rein her in,
and I just...

35:46.711 --> 35:48.711
Don't know how to rein her in,
exactly.

35:50.148 --> 35:51.781
All right.

35:51.883 --> 35:53.583
Well, maybe I can help you...

35:53.685 --> 35:55.318
With her.

35:58.390 --> 36:00.390
Maybe.

36:02.360 --> 36:04.327
Yeah, I don't...
I don't think so, though.

36:04.429 --> 36:07.463
But... but thank you.

36:10.669 --> 36:12.435
Thank you for helping me
with the car.

36:14.906 --> 36:16.773
With... with everything.

36:19.911 --> 36:24.113
You've really been a good...
Good friend.

36:24.215 --> 36:26.015
So are you, norman.

37:06.391 --> 37:07.590
Where are you going?

37:07.692 --> 37:09.659
We need to talk.

37:12.264 --> 37:13.463
Okay.

37:20.539 --> 37:23.673
I'm going to madeleine's
for dinner.

37:23.775 --> 37:25.842
I see.

37:28.713 --> 37:30.647
What if I don't think
that's a good idea?

37:30.749 --> 37:32.348
Well, I'm not really interested.

37:32.451 --> 37:34.851
In whether or not you think
it's a good idea.

37:34.953 --> 37:38.655
We've been on the opposite side
of what a good idea is lately.

37:42.194 --> 37:44.861
You have free will; So do i.

37:44.963 --> 37:46.930
You do what you're gonna do.

37:47.032 --> 37:48.498
I'm gonna do what I want to do.

37:48.600 --> 37:52.001
You're not doing
anything, mother...

37:52.104 --> 37:53.703
Not about her.

37:53.805 --> 37:55.472
Promise me.

37:55.574 --> 37:58.808
I promise that I will
always protect you.

37:58.910 --> 38:00.343
I have no choice.

38:00.445 --> 38:03.480
Well, I don't need any
protection from her.

38:03.582 --> 38:07.217
Well, I guess you
know what you need.

38:07.319 --> 38:10.019
Mother... Yes?

38:10.122 --> 38:11.654
Let me be really clear.

38:11.756 --> 38:13.123
Okay.

38:13.225 --> 38:16.226
I am going to have
dinner with madeleine,

38:16.328 --> 38:18.361
And I'm going to take care
of the car.

38:18.463 --> 38:21.131
And you need to accept me.

38:21.233 --> 38:23.333
As being in charge
of my own life now,

38:23.435 --> 38:25.535
Because I know we made
this arrangement, but...

38:34.746 --> 38:36.066
Just please let me
make decisions.

38:36.114 --> 38:37.881
And do what I need to do, okay?

38:42.854 --> 38:44.154
See you later.

38:44.256 --> 38:45.388
Bye.

38:59.671 --> 39:00.937
Hi.

39:03.708 --> 39:05.341
My god.
I shouldn't have worn this.

39:05.443 --> 39:07.443
I'm so sorry. Come in.

39:07.546 --> 39:09.026
I'll change.
No, no, no, don't change.

39:09.114 --> 39:11.748
You... you look wonderful,
madeleine.

39:11.850 --> 39:13.716
You just... it just shocked me
for a moment.

39:13.818 --> 39:16.052
Are you sure?

39:16.154 --> 39:18.087
I just... i tried it on
this afternoon,

39:18.190 --> 39:20.924
And it felt like second skin.

39:21.026 --> 39:23.560
I really forgot
I was wearing it.

39:23.662 --> 39:25.195
It was stupid of me.

39:25.297 --> 39:26.763
No, it wasn't stupid at all.

39:26.865 --> 39:28.464
I gave them to you to wear,

39:28.567 --> 39:30.047
And I'm just so pleased
you like them.

39:32.337 --> 39:33.570
Here, I got these for you.

39:33.672 --> 39:36.372
Thank you.

39:36.474 --> 39:37.907
Are you hungry? Yeah.

39:38.009 --> 39:39.909
Dinner's ready.
I... i made coq au vin,

39:40.011 --> 39:42.579
Which sounds fancy, but it's
just chicken and wine in a pot.

39:42.681 --> 39:44.480
Well, it sounds lovely.

39:44.583 --> 39:46.616
Come in.

39:46.718 --> 39:48.985
This is my place.

39:53.358 --> 39:55.558
This was delicious.

39:55.660 --> 39:58.661
Thank you. It's nice to cook.

39:58.763 --> 40:00.430
I feel like I don't
do it very often

40:00.532 --> 40:03.266
'cause sam's always
gone so much.

40:03.368 --> 40:05.301
It seems silly to go through
all the trouble.

40:05.403 --> 40:08.171
Just for one person.

40:08.273 --> 40:10.006
How... how is sam?

40:10.108 --> 40:11.774
He's fine.

40:11.876 --> 40:13.509
He's almost done with the deal.

40:13.612 --> 40:15.411
He's got going on in seattle.

40:15.513 --> 40:19.115
Hopefully things will
settle down after that.

40:19.217 --> 40:21.284
And did you ever get
to talk to him.

40:21.386 --> 40:22.986
About how you were feeling?

40:24.256 --> 40:26.289
No, i...

40:26.391 --> 40:29.926
I think I was just having
a bad day that day.

40:30.028 --> 40:34.330
We all have bad days when we
wonder what's real and not real.

40:34.432 --> 40:36.165
Do you have days like that?

40:38.436 --> 40:40.270
Yes, i...

40:40.372 --> 40:42.939
Think it's the nature
of relationships.

40:43.041 --> 40:44.540
They shift constantly.

40:44.643 --> 40:46.442
They change shape,

40:46.544 --> 40:47.844
Sometimes even minute to minute.

40:51.316 --> 40:53.049
It's hard to know what's real
in any moment,

40:53.151 --> 40:55.151
Unless it's right
in front of you.

40:55.253 --> 40:56.819
And you're experiencing it.

41:05.997 --> 41:08.164
I just think you should...

41:08.266 --> 41:10.133
Have that little talk with sam.

41:20.278 --> 41:21.577
Want to make a cake?

41:25.183 --> 41:27.183
And then we can, like,

41:27.285 --> 41:30.253
Watch a movie and eat cake?

41:31.923 --> 41:33.256
I'd love to.

41:33.358 --> 41:34.490
Okay.

42:03.062 --> 42:04.261
Alex?

42:10.236 --> 42:11.368
Hey, maggie.

42:13.906 --> 42:16.106
What are you doing here?

42:16.208 --> 42:17.541
It's just... just me.

42:17.643 --> 42:19.309
Is anyone inside?

42:19.411 --> 42:20.544
No.

42:22.448 --> 42:25.282
What happened to you?

42:25.384 --> 42:26.516
May I come in?

42:49.575 --> 42:51.041
Okay.

42:53.612 --> 42:55.156
I'm not trying to bogart
the cake-making.

42:55.180 --> 42:58.548
It's just all happening
here in this bowl.

42:58.651 --> 43:01.351
No, I'm having fun watching you.

43:01.453 --> 43:05.055
Okay, that doesn't sound creepy.

43:05.157 --> 43:06.823
Hey, will you get the milk out?

43:18.337 --> 43:20.537
One cup coming up.

43:20.639 --> 43:22.239
That rhymes.

43:22.341 --> 43:24.341
I'm a poet.

43:25.878 --> 43:27.444
Okay, pour it in,

43:27.546 --> 43:29.346
And I'll start the mixer.

43:29.448 --> 43:30.580
When you do.

43:34.687 --> 43:36.286
Here it comes.

43:39.491 --> 43:40.691
It's mixing now.

43:52.738 --> 43:54.404
We can bake it now.

44:26.338 --> 44:27.771
What's wrong?

44:27.873 --> 44:29.639
Wh... Norman, what?

44:48.794 --> 44:50.605
I have to go, okay?
This is... this isn't good.

44:50.629 --> 44:52.596
Norman, it's my fault.
I'm sorry.

45:09.982 --> 45:11.148
Mother!

45:15.320 --> 45:17.354
I need to talk to you right now.

45:21.894 --> 45:23.627
Stop playing games!
