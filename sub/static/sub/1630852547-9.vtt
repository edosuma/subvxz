WEBVTT

00:03.487 --> 00:05.004
(banging nearby)

00:05.172 --> 00:06.730
(floorboard creaking)

00:06.732 --> 00:08.490
-What was that?
-(thudding)

00:08.567 --> 00:10.634
Okay, yeah, I'm not
staying here to find out.

00:14.331 --> 00:16.515
-Hi, Carter.
-Hey, Phil.

00:16.742 --> 00:17.683
Do you believe in ghosts?

00:17.834 --> 00:19.076
Absolutely.

00:19.186 --> 00:21.503
Why else would they have
all those ghosthunter shows

00:21.522 --> 00:22.746
-on TV?
-Right!

00:22.839 --> 00:24.248
I mean,
TV networks wouldn't just

00:24.266 --> 00:26.266
-make all that stuff up
to get ratings.
-Mm-hmm.

00:26.418 --> 00:28.694
My grandma's house had one.

00:28.879 --> 00:30.087
I think it was
a three-legged dog.

00:30.180 --> 00:32.756
-You think?
-Yeah, I would hear panting.

00:32.816 --> 00:34.274
And then pat-a-pat-a-thump!

00:34.368 --> 00:36.443
-Pat-a-pat-a-thump!
-Oh!

00:36.595 --> 00:38.262
I'm pretty sure I got
a ghost at the Middle C.

00:38.430 --> 00:40.597
I mean, I heard some strange
sounds coming from the basement.

00:40.690 --> 00:42.449
Ghosts love basements.

00:42.601 --> 00:46.027
And attics and the gazebo
out at Cherokee Park.

00:46.196 --> 00:47.546
Do not go cruising there.

00:47.773 --> 00:50.549
When my aunt owned the bar,
she told me there was ghosts.

00:50.700 --> 00:52.534
My cousin Darren said
she made it all up

00:52.553 --> 00:54.294
to keep us from going down there
and drinking beers.

00:54.371 --> 00:55.870
I guess we'll never know.

00:55.964 --> 00:58.115
Why don't you just
go down there and look?

00:58.133 --> 01:01.060
I said I guess we'll never know.

01:05.215 --> 01:06.623
I'm not sure about this.

01:06.716 --> 01:08.567
Ghosts will suck
the life right out of you.

01:08.794 --> 01:10.051
That's a proven fact.

01:10.071 --> 01:11.461
That's why I got
my bucket filled

01:11.480 --> 01:13.054
with my special
ghost-catching formula.

01:13.148 --> 01:15.148
That's just a bunch of stuff
from the kitchen.

01:15.301 --> 01:16.483
I saw you put it together.

01:16.635 --> 01:18.969
Well, the flour is
so we can see them.

01:18.987 --> 01:21.080
The cinnamon is
to slow them down.

01:21.307 --> 01:24.917
And the sugar is to make nice
in case they have a vendetta.

01:25.068 --> 01:26.585
Okay, yeah.

01:26.736 --> 01:28.979
-That makes sense.
-We come in peace.

01:28.997 --> 01:31.406
Yeah. We're also very strong.

01:31.425 --> 01:33.967
-(thudding)
-(both scream)

01:36.597 --> 01:38.004
(both screaming, sobbing)

01:38.157 --> 01:40.490
-Did you hear that?
-(screaming in distance)

01:40.509 --> 01:42.008
Sounds like it's coming
from the Middle C.

01:42.161 --> 01:44.419
-Where you going?
-The Middle C!

01:44.438 --> 01:45.938
Haven't you watched
any horror movies?

01:46.165 --> 01:47.831
You never run
towards the scream!

01:48.834 --> 01:52.986
Oh, damn it, I'm running
towards the scream. (whimpers)

01:53.689 --> 01:55.188
-Hello?
-Carter?

01:55.341 --> 01:56.598
CARTER:
In the basement!

01:56.617 --> 01:58.992
The basement?
When did he get a basement?

02:01.680 --> 02:03.680
What is going on?!

02:03.773 --> 02:05.515
This fool been living down here.

02:05.534 --> 02:07.367
Hey.

02:07.519 --> 02:08.443
Seriously, am I the only one

02:08.537 --> 02:10.295
that didn't know
about the damn basement?

02:11.874 --> 02:13.206
♪<i> Me, oh, my, oh, my, oh, me</i> ♪

02:13.300 --> 02:15.041
♪<i> Nothin' wrong with you</i>
<i> but I'd rather be me.</i> ♪

02:15.177 --> 02:17.377
Okay, the truth is,
I was evicted,

02:17.529 --> 02:19.696
and I didn't have
any place else to go.

02:19.715 --> 02:21.306
So for the last two weeks,

02:21.533 --> 02:23.642
I have been living
in the basement.

02:23.793 --> 02:25.126
Which is, like, 30 feet away.

02:25.146 --> 02:26.628
Why are you always late to work?

02:26.796 --> 02:28.963
Wait, where's Phil?

02:29.057 --> 02:31.299
Oh, he's downstairs cleaning up
his ghost-powder.

02:31.318 --> 02:33.318
His words were,
"He who heaps it,

02:33.470 --> 02:34.802
sweeps it."

02:34.897 --> 02:36.546
Max, how did this even happen?

02:36.565 --> 02:38.473
I kept coming up short
on rent and then eventually

02:38.567 --> 02:40.308
there was an eviction notice
on the door,

02:40.477 --> 02:41.809
and also a dozen cookies.

02:41.829 --> 02:43.495
My landlord really liked me.

02:43.722 --> 02:44.997
I'm a great tenant.

02:45.166 --> 02:46.740
Except for the...

02:46.892 --> 02:48.650
not-paying-rent part.

02:48.744 --> 02:50.502
Why didn't you tell us?

02:50.654 --> 02:52.562
Because...

02:52.656 --> 02:54.173
I was embarrassed.

02:54.400 --> 02:56.491
Embarrassed? In front of me?

02:56.510 --> 02:58.326
Me, who once spent
two hours trying

02:58.345 --> 03:01.013
to save a stray dog
who turned out to be a coyote?

03:01.998 --> 03:04.533
Me, who tripped at a wedding and
knocked the entire bridal party

03:04.668 --> 03:06.834
not just to the ground,
but into a lake?

03:06.929 --> 03:08.503
Me, who-- stop me anytime.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.080
I could go all day.

03:10.098 --> 03:11.023
You're right.

03:11.250 --> 03:12.357
I should've told you.

03:12.509 --> 03:14.434
So, wait, you work
in this bar full time

03:14.586 --> 03:16.436
and get way bigger tips
than I do,

03:16.588 --> 03:18.588
and you still couldn't
pay your rent?

03:18.607 --> 03:19.698
No judgement.

03:19.849 --> 03:21.258
MAX:
I know.

03:21.276 --> 03:22.609
I know, I just, I've...

03:22.761 --> 03:24.444
never been any good with money.

03:24.596 --> 03:26.096
I think I need help.

03:26.265 --> 03:27.431
Kat, will you help...?

03:27.524 --> 03:29.616
Yes. I mean,
not to toot my own horn,

03:29.710 --> 03:31.768
-but I've always been
good with numbers.
-BOTH: Numbers.

03:31.787 --> 03:33.603
Hey, it's not my fault.

03:33.622 --> 03:35.547
ALL THREE: Math just always
made sense to me.

03:36.717 --> 03:39.276
(groans) I cannot believe
you've been living

03:39.294 --> 03:40.886
in that dank, mildewy,

03:41.037 --> 03:43.388
disgusting basement
for two whole weeks.

03:43.540 --> 03:44.706
Well, not anymore.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.225
Till we get your finances
straightened out,

03:46.376 --> 03:47.542
you can sleep on my couch.

03:47.561 --> 03:49.877
Wait, hold up,
isn't that where I sleep?

03:49.897 --> 03:51.212
Oh, well, you can sleep with me.

03:51.306 --> 03:52.472
I got new nasal strips.

03:52.566 --> 03:54.140
No way, you throw off
a lot of heat.

03:54.235 --> 03:55.809
You're like a furnace
that kicks.

03:55.961 --> 03:57.677
CARTER:
Fine.

03:57.829 --> 03:59.129
Look, I'll be the hero.

03:59.222 --> 04:00.480
He can sleep on my couch.

04:00.574 --> 04:03.316
Wait a minute, I also sleep
at your place sometimes.

04:03.410 --> 04:04.409
I don't know, Max.

04:04.561 --> 04:06.561
That secret basement seems
pretty nice.

04:06.655 --> 04:08.229
Ooh, and I also
just read an article

04:08.323 --> 04:10.540
about mildew being good for you.

04:12.068 --> 04:13.159
(chuckles)

04:13.312 --> 04:14.920
Ooh, that guy is so intense.

04:15.147 --> 04:16.755
He is giving me
serial killer vibes.

04:16.924 --> 04:19.091
Yeah, I think he's hot, too.

04:19.242 --> 04:21.985
Okay, we have
very different taste in men.

04:22.078 --> 04:23.262
Well, I don't know about that.

04:23.489 --> 04:24.912
I'd definitely date Carter.

04:24.932 --> 04:26.581
And we both
like Benedict Cumberbatch.

04:26.675 --> 04:29.268
That's right,
we're Cumber-bitches!

04:29.419 --> 04:31.678
Hello, all.

04:31.772 --> 04:32.829
Oh, hey, Sheila.

04:32.848 --> 04:34.014
Randi, you take

04:34.108 --> 04:36.108
pictures of people, right?

04:36.259 --> 04:37.925
For some reason it sounds creepy

04:37.945 --> 04:39.836
when you say it like that,
but, yes,

04:39.838 --> 04:41.113
I am studying photography.

04:41.282 --> 04:44.524
She once took
nude photos of me for her class.

04:44.676 --> 04:47.344
They were provocative,
yet tasteful.

04:47.437 --> 04:49.103
Like Lady Gaga.

04:49.197 --> 04:51.272
Would you be willing
to take some of me?

04:51.292 --> 04:54.459
Not nude-- that's a mistake
I'll never make again.

04:54.686 --> 04:56.520
But I need photos

04:56.538 --> 04:58.446
for my dating profile.

04:58.465 --> 04:59.464
Of course!

04:59.691 --> 05:00.874
So you're getting
back out there?

05:01.026 --> 05:02.450
Yes, but, apparently,
to do that,

05:02.619 --> 05:04.303
I have to learn
how to use dating apps.

05:04.530 --> 05:05.637
Oh, honestly,

05:05.789 --> 05:07.639
it's almost worse
when you know how to use them.

05:07.866 --> 05:08.974
PHIL:
Oh, I agree.

05:09.125 --> 05:10.717
What was wrong with a...

05:10.869 --> 05:12.978
wink across a crowded bar?

05:13.129 --> 05:14.371
A little wave.

05:14.464 --> 05:16.315
A flirty smile.

05:16.466 --> 05:18.483
Oh, yeah, honey.

05:18.710 --> 05:20.986
I got game.

05:21.989 --> 05:24.714
(sighs)
This is a disaster.

05:24.733 --> 05:26.733
-Hey, go easy on me.
-I did.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.735
I was gonna call it
a dumpster fire.

05:28.829 --> 05:31.388
You have seven credit cards.

05:31.390 --> 05:32.739
You owe money on all of them.

05:32.891 --> 05:34.649
Plus you pay a monthly fee

05:34.743 --> 05:37.002
for a storage locker--
what's even in there?

05:37.153 --> 05:39.120
Furniture I owe money on.

05:39.915 --> 05:42.174
How did you make it this far?

05:42.401 --> 05:43.400
I know.

05:43.493 --> 05:44.343
No, really.

05:44.570 --> 05:46.570
How did you make it this far?

05:46.663 --> 05:48.738
Well, after-after college,

05:48.832 --> 05:50.423
I went to teach in Myanmar,
and the program

05:50.576 --> 05:52.425
took care
of most of my expenses.

05:52.578 --> 05:54.853
Then I ended up in Paris,
where I met Brigitte.

05:55.080 --> 05:56.021
(gasps)

05:56.172 --> 05:57.505
Was she your sugar mama?

05:57.524 --> 05:59.766
No. I mean...

05:59.843 --> 06:01.342
sure, she owned the flat

06:01.362 --> 06:03.028
and didn't make me pay rent.

06:03.255 --> 06:04.512
And she bought the groceries.

06:04.590 --> 06:07.657
And paid for the gas
and the electricity...

06:09.203 --> 06:10.494
Huh.

06:11.430 --> 06:13.705
Well, between that and the $70

06:13.932 --> 06:15.374
a week you spend on smoothies,

06:15.601 --> 06:17.209
I'm beginning
to see how you got here.

06:17.360 --> 06:20.695
I love smoothies-- sometimes
I'm just too tired to chew.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.196
You can make them at home.

06:22.290 --> 06:23.273
They're not the same.

06:23.291 --> 06:25.550
They're not. Why is that?

06:25.702 --> 06:27.034
Well, smoothies aside,

06:27.129 --> 06:29.370
I think the best place to begin
is with a proper budget.

06:29.539 --> 06:31.556
Got it. All right, tell me more.

06:31.708 --> 06:33.725
Well, uh, for starters,

06:33.952 --> 06:35.394
no more needless spending.

06:35.621 --> 06:38.138
Only buy essentials
and-and take advantage

06:38.290 --> 06:40.565
of-of coupons, sales,
that sort of thing.

06:40.717 --> 06:42.125
Great, then what?

06:42.144 --> 06:43.977
Then we get to make
a spreadsheet, and nothing

06:44.129 --> 06:46.238
makes me tinglier
than a fresh spreadsheet.

06:46.465 --> 06:47.480
(chuckles) Awesome.

06:47.633 --> 06:49.223
And to thank you,
let me buy you lunch.

06:49.317 --> 06:50.300
There's this new French place.

06:50.318 --> 06:51.317
It's a little pricey,

06:51.394 --> 06:53.328
but they serve bread in a beret.

06:54.322 --> 06:56.206
It's gonna be a process.

06:59.995 --> 07:02.587
Ooh, nice, nice.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.089
Yes. Okay, wait.

07:04.240 --> 07:05.815
Look up towards this corner.

07:05.834 --> 07:07.317
Little bit. Perfect!

07:07.335 --> 07:10.320
Yes! You are a red-headed snack.

07:10.338 --> 07:11.821
I don't know,
I'm not feeling it.

07:11.915 --> 07:14.081
What?
No, Sheila, you look beautiful.

07:14.101 --> 07:16.250
I think it's my clothes--
they're too casual.

07:16.344 --> 07:19.271
I look like I've just come in
from giving up on life.

07:19.498 --> 07:22.107
-I'm gonna go change.
-Again?
This is your fourth outfit.

07:22.276 --> 07:23.758
It'll just take a second.

07:23.852 --> 07:26.153
Okay, well,
all them seconds add up.

07:27.430 --> 07:29.339
Nice.

07:29.432 --> 07:30.765
Nice!

07:30.859 --> 07:32.175
Okay.

07:32.194 --> 07:33.434
What? Now what?

07:33.454 --> 07:35.269
The sun is coming in
through this window.

07:35.363 --> 07:38.682
I'm gonna look washed out in
this dark jacket, just a second.

07:38.700 --> 07:40.517
All right.

07:40.610 --> 07:42.519
I'll just be right here.

07:42.537 --> 07:45.297
Slowly losing the will to live.

07:46.191 --> 07:48.041
Ooh, this is cute.

07:48.193 --> 07:49.876
Ooh, something is funny.

07:50.028 --> 07:51.470
(laughs)
Take a little sip for me.

07:51.621 --> 07:54.455
-You sure this isn't too much?
-You look great.

07:54.475 --> 07:56.866
I really think the light
is better on the patio.

07:56.885 --> 07:58.960
Uh, it's pretty chilly
out there.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.370
Oh, good!

08:00.388 --> 08:02.689
Everything's perkier
when it's cold.

08:09.731 --> 08:10.805
Someone's late again.

08:10.899 --> 08:11.823
Someone needs to accept

08:12.050 --> 08:13.550
that I won't always be on time.

08:13.568 --> 08:15.068
Are those new shoes?

08:15.220 --> 08:16.644
Oh, yeah, you like 'em?

08:16.663 --> 08:18.312
And they glow in the dark.

08:18.406 --> 08:20.499
Cool, do they also
pay for themselves?

08:20.650 --> 08:22.751
(chuckles)
If only.

08:24.579 --> 08:26.246
Hey, are new high-tops
that glow in the dark

08:26.398 --> 08:27.580
a part of Max's budget?

08:27.749 --> 08:29.490
No, they are not.

08:29.510 --> 08:30.992
Where is he?

08:31.011 --> 08:33.094
Max, front and center!

08:33.997 --> 08:35.238
Oh, hey, Kat.

08:35.331 --> 08:37.498
Glow-in-the-dark shoes?

08:37.592 --> 08:39.909
I can't tell
if you're mad or impressed.

08:39.928 --> 08:41.244
We had a budget.

08:41.337 --> 08:43.522
You weren't supposed to buy
any new clothes

08:43.631 --> 08:45.673
for at least a month--
it's in the spreadsheet.

08:45.767 --> 08:48.434
I specifically put it
on line six, column four.

08:48.587 --> 08:51.345
And I used Helvetica Bold-- that
is not a font you can ignore!

08:51.365 --> 08:52.864
But they were on sale,
and you said

08:53.033 --> 08:54.366
if something's on sale,
that I should buy it.

08:54.593 --> 08:56.609
You are twisting my words
for retail purposes,

08:56.762 --> 08:58.019
and I think you know that.

08:58.038 --> 09:00.446
The saleslady said
I looked really hot in them.

09:00.599 --> 09:02.040
And I still have
ten dollars left over

09:02.191 --> 09:03.542
to last me the next 16 days.

09:03.693 --> 09:05.435
That's 62 cents a day.

09:05.528 --> 09:07.045
Wow, it's amazing
how you do that so fast.

09:07.196 --> 09:09.047
Yeah, it's this method
of division where-- Hey!

09:09.274 --> 09:11.216
Do not try and distract me
with flattery!

09:11.443 --> 09:13.109
(sighs)
I'm sorry, you're right.

09:13.128 --> 09:14.444
I'll return the shoes.

09:14.462 --> 09:16.037
Glad I didn't wear
the leather jacket.

09:16.131 --> 09:18.631
-What?!
-I'm taking that back, too.

09:19.451 --> 09:20.967
You did a good thing
by calling me.

09:21.061 --> 09:23.186
Yeah, I felt that.

09:24.047 --> 09:25.972
Yes, yes.

09:26.141 --> 09:28.600
Glowing, okay!

09:28.676 --> 09:30.310
Okay, this time I think

09:30.462 --> 09:31.719
we really got some good ones.

09:31.888 --> 09:34.464
See, I knew I was right
to change into jewel tones.

09:34.557 --> 09:36.482
(chuckles)

09:36.559 --> 09:38.059
Oh, no, no, no, no.

09:38.078 --> 09:40.303
These are not gonna work at all.
This was a mistake.

09:40.396 --> 09:41.913
Don't be so hard on yourself.
I'm sure

09:42.140 --> 09:43.656
if we keep going, we'll find
something you can use.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.066
No, this was my fault.

09:45.085 --> 09:47.068
I should've known better
than to hire an amateur.

09:47.162 --> 09:49.087
Wha-- hold up,
you didn't hire me.

09:49.238 --> 09:50.313
This was a favor.

09:50.332 --> 09:51.981
Well, I'm sorry, but I think

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
I'm gonna have to fire you
from this favor.

09:54.152 --> 09:55.652
Are you kidding me?

09:55.670 --> 09:57.153
You know what, it's fine.

09:57.172 --> 09:59.656
Don't be discouraged,
I'm sure with more practice

09:59.674 --> 10:01.433
you'll get better.

10:01.660 --> 10:03.843
By the way,
that evening gown was too much!

10:03.995 --> 10:07.063
Got me doing this
on my damn day off.

10:11.002 --> 10:12.944
Then she changed
her clothes again,

10:13.096 --> 10:15.280
called me an amateur,
and then fired me.

10:15.431 --> 10:16.448
Really?

10:16.599 --> 10:18.432
My mother was difficult?

10:18.526 --> 10:19.618
I know, I know. I'm used to her

10:19.769 --> 10:21.177
being snarky and sarcastic.

10:21.196 --> 10:22.937
But to you, not to me.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.364
Aw, well, the more she does it,

10:24.516 --> 10:25.790
the more you'll start
to find it comforting.

10:25.983 --> 10:27.792
-(door opens)
-Well...

10:27.944 --> 10:29.202
they wouldn't take
the shoes back.

10:29.296 --> 10:30.036
Why not?

10:30.130 --> 10:32.464
Oh, 'cause they're so ugly.

10:32.691 --> 10:33.857
No.

10:33.967 --> 10:35.967
Because they were on sale,
and the soles got dirty

10:36.194 --> 10:38.711
from walking
on this disgusting bar floor.

10:38.864 --> 10:39.879
Uh, isn't it your job to mop?

10:40.031 --> 10:41.455
I didn't want to get water
on my new shoes.

10:41.475 --> 10:44.200
Oh, scared it'll wash
the ugly off of them?

10:44.886 --> 10:46.870
I get it,
you don't like the shoes.

10:46.963 --> 10:48.388
But they're not returnable,
so...

10:48.464 --> 10:49.814
-I love them.
-CARTER: Hey.

10:49.983 --> 10:52.208
Y'all know the band
Florida Georgia Line?

10:52.227 --> 10:54.043
Um, yeah! We love those guys.

10:54.062 --> 10:55.987
They're amazing.

He can get all of us tickets

11:04.222 --> 11:05.905
VIP seats, backstage passes,

11:05.999 --> 11:07.740
and we'll probably
get to meet them after.

11:07.834 --> 11:08.833
Well, I've never heard of them,

11:08.985 --> 11:10.651
but I'm all about being a VIP.

11:10.671 --> 11:13.338
I am in! I've never been
backstage at a concert before.

11:13.565 --> 11:14.506
Will there be shrimp?

11:14.657 --> 11:16.082
I always picture shrimp
at these things.

11:16.234 --> 11:17.658
I am definitely in.

11:17.752 --> 11:18.902
Great, I'll let him know.

11:18.920 --> 11:20.512
-Tickets are 80 bucks apiece.
-Oh.

11:20.663 --> 11:22.071
Shoot. Sorry, Max.

11:22.090 --> 11:24.407
-What?
-Well, it's not in your budget.

11:24.500 --> 11:25.833
I'll make it work.

11:25.852 --> 11:26.685
How?

11:26.836 --> 11:28.169
I don't know, sell my blood?

11:28.263 --> 11:30.096
Or sperm. I'm tall.

11:30.248 --> 11:32.415
Wow, where were these ideas
when we were trying

11:32.434 --> 11:34.025
to find your next car payment?

11:34.252 --> 11:36.085
Listen, I know
it's a little expensive,

11:36.104 --> 11:37.511
but I really want
to see these guys.

11:37.531 --> 11:39.197
Can I just talk to you
for a second?

11:39.348 --> 11:42.091
Ooh, Max is in trouble.

11:42.185 --> 11:43.535
Max is not in trouble.

11:43.745 --> 11:45.278
Max, you are so in trouble.

11:45.430 --> 11:46.538
What is the point
of making a budget

11:46.765 --> 11:47.688
if you're not gonna stick to it?

11:47.782 --> 11:49.190
But I really want to go.

11:49.284 --> 11:50.283
But you can't afford it.

11:50.435 --> 11:52.026
But it's Florida Georgia Line.

11:52.045 --> 11:52.936
But you can't afford it.

11:52.954 --> 11:54.361
Maybe I can get a payday loan.

11:54.456 --> 11:55.288
Okay.

11:55.382 --> 11:56.789
I don't want to be your mother.

11:56.942 --> 11:58.216
Do whatever you think is right.

11:58.367 --> 11:59.867
Well, if I knew what was right,

11:59.886 --> 12:01.945
I wouldn't be living
on Carter's couch.

12:02.038 --> 12:05.098
So, uh,
what's the head count here?

12:10.138 --> 12:12.213
So, Mother, question.

12:12.307 --> 12:13.714
Do you think what you said

12:13.734 --> 12:15.308
to Randi was rude?

12:15.402 --> 12:16.642
No.

12:16.795 --> 12:19.220
Okay, so, statement.

12:19.239 --> 12:21.906
What you said to Randi was rude.

12:22.058 --> 12:23.575
I wasn't rude.

12:23.726 --> 12:26.636
It's not her fault
her photos were terrible.

12:26.805 --> 12:28.805
She just has no experience.

12:28.898 --> 12:31.249
Sometimes I think
you don't even hear yourself.

12:31.476 --> 12:32.842
It's like when you first

12:32.844 --> 12:35.402
opened the café-- you had
no idea what you were doing.

12:35.422 --> 12:37.647
That's why I didn't
drink the coffee.

12:37.740 --> 12:39.165
But you ordered it all the time.

12:39.259 --> 12:40.817
To support you, my darling.

12:40.835 --> 12:43.920
But I always dumped it
in the planter in the courtyard.

12:44.956 --> 12:46.672
Is that why
all those flowers died?

12:46.767 --> 12:48.082
They were geraniums.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.684
They deserved to die.

12:50.662 --> 12:51.677
Here you go, Sheila.

12:51.830 --> 12:53.772
Make sure she drinks that.

12:53.999 --> 12:55.331
So...

12:55.333 --> 12:58.276
-how is the online dating going?
-(sighs)

12:58.427 --> 13:00.111
It's on hold.
I can't do anything

13:00.263 --> 13:02.021
until I get a good picture.

13:02.173 --> 13:04.598
And Randi just couldn't
capture me.

13:04.692 --> 13:06.267
Mm-hmm, I heard about that.

13:06.361 --> 13:08.435
You know, I'm still seeing

13:08.530 --> 13:10.271
Nurse Nelson.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.682
It's casual, but fun.

13:12.775 --> 13:14.517
Strange time to rub it in,

13:14.686 --> 13:16.035
but okay.

13:16.187 --> 13:17.945
Well, it's all thanks
to you, Sheila.

13:18.039 --> 13:19.780
I would never have
met him had you

13:19.800 --> 13:21.633
not made me go back out there.

13:21.826 --> 13:24.451
And believe me, I was scared.

13:24.471 --> 13:25.953
It is scary.

13:25.972 --> 13:27.121
I'm told.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.198
And no one is at their best

13:29.292 --> 13:31.217
when they're scared.

13:31.311 --> 13:32.644
No.

13:32.871 --> 13:35.188
They're not, are they?

13:53.834 --> 13:55.333
(whistle blows,
buzzer sounds on TV)

13:55.560 --> 13:58.319
So you're missing the concert
because you bought shoes?

13:58.487 --> 13:59.838
Yep.

14:00.065 --> 14:01.747
Those shoes?

14:01.900 --> 14:04.658
Yeah, and I'm fine with it.

14:04.678 --> 14:07.587
I-I live life for the moment.

14:07.663 --> 14:08.905
I don't worry about it.

14:08.998 --> 14:10.756
And trust things will
take care of themselves.

14:10.909 --> 14:13.667
Wait, you sleep
on my dad's couch,

14:13.687 --> 14:15.078
you're missing a concert,

14:15.171 --> 14:16.503
and all you've got
to show for it are

14:16.523 --> 14:18.189
the ugliest sneakers
in the world?

14:18.341 --> 14:20.841
Why does everybody
hate these shoes?

14:21.603 --> 14:23.677
You know, if you want
to go to the concert,

14:23.771 --> 14:25.438
I could loan you $80.

14:25.532 --> 14:28.032
I'm not taking money
from a 12-year-old.

14:28.259 --> 14:30.259
And where were you
three days ago?

14:30.278 --> 14:32.704
Also, how do you have $80?

14:32.855 --> 14:34.873
The old ladies at church
pay me to mow their lawns

14:35.024 --> 14:36.933
and teach them
how to use their cell phones.

14:37.026 --> 14:39.452
A lot of money
in old ladies at church.

14:39.604 --> 14:40.545
Huh.

14:40.696 --> 14:41.713
Then I put everything I make

14:41.864 --> 14:43.364
into a high-yield
savings account.

14:43.383 --> 14:44.716
As one does.

14:44.867 --> 14:46.200
My dad says having
your own money

14:46.294 --> 14:47.944
is what makes you a man.

14:48.037 --> 14:48.869
(knocking at door)

14:48.963 --> 14:50.704
Mm, that's probably the pizza.

14:50.798 --> 14:52.465
Don't worry, I got it.

14:52.617 --> 14:54.058
Oh, wow, thanks.

14:54.210 --> 14:57.186
Hmm, if I had known that,
I would've got the garlic knots.

15:04.295 --> 15:06.446
-Max, wake up.
-(snorts, sighs)

15:07.298 --> 15:08.740
Hey, what's going on?

15:08.891 --> 15:10.816
I know my dad said you could
stay as long as you need to,

15:10.969 --> 15:12.744
but he's dead and you got to go.

15:13.580 --> 15:14.913
(coughing)

15:15.140 --> 15:18.141
I just need,
I just need a few more weeks,

15:18.309 --> 15:19.918
and then I'll be
back on my feet.

15:20.145 --> 15:22.587
Man, you've been saying that
for the last 30 years.

15:23.665 --> 15:24.923
Hi, CJ. Hey, Max.

15:25.074 --> 15:26.666
I brought you
day-old donuts from the café,

15:26.760 --> 15:30.178
just like I've been doing every
week for the last 30 years.

15:31.990 --> 15:34.248
Why am I old and you're not?

15:34.267 --> 15:36.100
Because I have a home and a bed.

15:36.327 --> 15:39.145
And a high-yield
savings account.

15:40.589 --> 15:42.423
(gasping)

15:42.442 --> 15:44.651
(stammers)

15:46.854 --> 15:49.113
Oh, thank God! I'm still young.

15:49.932 --> 15:50.949
(exhales)

15:51.176 --> 15:53.451
(knocking at door)

15:57.457 --> 15:59.606
Oh. Hi.

15:59.701 --> 16:01.108
May I come in?

16:01.127 --> 16:03.944
I guess. If you don't mind
hanging out with an amateur.

16:03.964 --> 16:06.130
About that...

16:06.299 --> 16:07.465
May I sit?

16:07.692 --> 16:10.526
If you don't mind
sitting next to an amateur.

16:10.528 --> 16:12.119
Okay, you've made your point.

16:12.138 --> 16:14.547
Have I? Are you sure
I have enough experience

16:14.699 --> 16:16.641
to make a point?

16:16.792 --> 16:19.035
I'm sorry for the way I behaved.

16:19.128 --> 16:20.536
You were helping me,

16:20.555 --> 16:22.629
and I shouldn't have
treated you like that.

16:22.724 --> 16:24.482
Well, thank you.

16:24.633 --> 16:27.043
It's just dating...

16:27.061 --> 16:28.820
is new to me and...

16:28.971 --> 16:30.880
what if men see those photos,

16:30.973 --> 16:32.398
and think I look ridiculous?

16:32.550 --> 16:33.491
They won't.

16:33.642 --> 16:34.734
I just can't stand

16:34.886 --> 16:35.827
the thought of men

16:35.978 --> 16:38.237
thinking I'm old and desperate.

16:38.373 --> 16:41.073
I get it--
dating at any age is hard.

16:41.226 --> 16:42.908
But can I make an observation?

16:43.061 --> 16:44.002
Oh, I suppose.

16:44.229 --> 16:46.729
I'm hearing
a lot of "what men think."

16:46.748 --> 16:49.415
What about what you think
and how you feel?

16:49.567 --> 16:50.842
(sighs)

16:50.993 --> 16:53.736
Right now I just
feel undesirable.

16:54.422 --> 16:56.589
You know what,
I think we should try

16:56.683 --> 16:59.333
the photoshoot again,
but this time for you,

16:59.352 --> 17:01.744
so you can see
how sexy you really are.

17:01.913 --> 17:03.579
If you'll just trust me.

17:03.598 --> 17:05.765
You know, the amateur.

17:06.751 --> 17:09.418
You're not gonna let me
live that down, are you?

17:09.437 --> 17:10.920
I will.

17:10.938 --> 17:12.438
Eventually.

17:12.590 --> 17:14.699
Gifts might help.

17:15.610 --> 17:17.184
Here is your usual BLT.

17:17.278 --> 17:18.944
Hold the B, extra T.

17:19.097 --> 17:20.263
Or as I like to call it,

17:20.281 --> 17:22.265
"wet vegetables on bread."

17:22.433 --> 17:23.524
Thank you.

17:23.601 --> 17:26.193
That concert last night was
so much fun.

17:26.287 --> 17:28.880
Hey, not really
a crowd-surfing kind of show,

17:29.031 --> 17:30.439
but respect.

17:30.441 --> 17:33.217
Bruises heal,
memories last forever.

17:33.369 --> 17:35.202
I do wish Max could've gone.

17:35.296 --> 17:36.946
He would've loved it.

17:37.039 --> 17:38.614
Maybe we should've pitched in,
and bought him a ticket.

17:38.633 --> 17:39.840
We've given him enough.

17:39.951 --> 17:41.284
I'm letting him sleep
on my couch.

17:41.302 --> 17:42.635
You're helping him
with his budget.

17:42.729 --> 17:45.229
I mean, as parents,
I think we've done all we can.

17:45.456 --> 17:46.880
You're right, you're right.

17:46.974 --> 17:48.882
We have to let him walk
on his own two feet

17:48.976 --> 17:50.234
like a grown man.

17:50.386 --> 17:52.328
Howdy.

17:53.131 --> 17:55.239
Or a grown man
in a cowboy costume.

17:55.466 --> 17:57.133
Please tell me
you didn't buy a horse.

17:57.151 --> 17:59.302
I did not. I got a second job.

17:59.395 --> 18:01.562
Driving cattle
from Texas to Oklahoma?

18:01.639 --> 18:03.489
I'm gonna be working
children's birthday parties.

18:03.641 --> 18:05.641
I just came from my first one.
I sing,

18:05.660 --> 18:07.493
I play the guitar,
I man the pony ride.

18:07.645 --> 18:09.587
Still trying to master
throwing the lasso,

18:09.664 --> 18:10.813
but I'll get there.

18:10.832 --> 18:12.614
Well, there's
your first mistake.

18:12.667 --> 18:14.074
You don't<i> throw</i> a lasso.

18:14.094 --> 18:15.426
You swing and release.

18:15.578 --> 18:18.487
I'm not an expert,
but I've dabbled.

18:18.581 --> 18:20.506
I just...

18:20.600 --> 18:22.100
I don't want
to be living on CJ's couch

18:22.327 --> 18:23.584
when Carter is dead.

18:23.603 --> 18:25.586
Awesome. Wait, what?

18:25.605 --> 18:26.920
That's so great, Max.

18:27.014 --> 18:28.681
You're finally
taking control of your life.

18:28.833 --> 18:29.682
Not great. Why am I dead?

18:29.834 --> 18:31.016
Mm, it's not important.

18:31.260 --> 18:33.611
You feel like, uh, eating bread
out of a beret tomorrow?

18:33.838 --> 18:36.172
According to my spreadsheet,
I can afford it now.

18:36.265 --> 18:38.765
Ooh, I don't know
what I'm more excited about,

18:38.785 --> 18:40.952
the spreadsheet
or food in a hat.

18:41.179 --> 18:42.528
So how much you getting paid
on the wagon train?

18:42.622 --> 18:45.123
Not a lot,
but the tips are fantastic.

18:45.333 --> 18:46.182
Whoa!

18:46.200 --> 18:47.274
Yeah, turns out parents

18:47.368 --> 18:48.701
of small children
will pay any price

18:48.795 --> 18:50.703
for five minutes of peace.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.279
Wine-soaked mothers

18:52.298 --> 18:54.966
are my old ladies at church.

19:01.716 --> 19:03.699
Okay, all right.

19:03.718 --> 19:05.977
Ooh, you are fierce.

19:06.128 --> 19:07.478
You are on fire.

19:07.630 --> 19:08.721
Yes, you are fierce.

19:08.873 --> 19:11.348
Watch out Tyra Banks. Ooh!

19:11.575 --> 19:12.466
Oh, my goodness.

19:12.485 --> 19:14.301
Oh, look at these,
they are so good.

19:14.320 --> 19:15.711
Wow!

19:15.804 --> 19:18.138
You really worked your magic.

19:18.307 --> 19:19.598
No, the magic is you.

19:19.750 --> 19:21.642
Once you weren't doing it
for other people,

19:21.736 --> 19:23.235
you got out of your own head.

19:23.329 --> 19:24.662
Thank you.

19:24.739 --> 19:26.164
Can we do a few more?

19:26.315 --> 19:27.481
I'm having so much fun.

19:27.575 --> 19:29.000
Oh, of course, you bet.

19:29.227 --> 19:30.751
Now give me something new.

19:31.838 --> 19:33.171
Ooh, oh!

19:33.322 --> 19:35.231
We kicking shoes off.
She-- oh!

19:35.324 --> 19:37.082
You better slide down, Sheila!

19:37.177 --> 19:39.844
You better-- oh, you're coming
towards the camera!

19:40.071 --> 19:42.071
Oh, hold on! Okay!

19:42.164 --> 19:43.589
Oh, hold on now.

19:43.758 --> 19:45.574
Hold on, Sheila!

19:45.668 --> 19:48.728
-(Sheila yowling)
-Okay, oh, you've been holding
out on me!

19:50.581 --> 19:53.006
You look
like you've seen a ghost.

19:53.100 --> 19:54.525
Wait, did you see a ghost?

19:54.752 --> 19:55.359
Worse.

19:55.511 --> 19:56.677
What's worse than a ghost?

19:56.696 --> 19:59.030
Parental sensuality.

19:59.848 --> 20:01.106
I'm sorry I asked.

20:01.259 --> 20:03.517
Hey, have you spoken to Max?
How's the new job going?

20:03.594 --> 20:05.686
Good. His spurs are
scratching up my wood floors,

20:05.763 --> 20:07.263
but he's making money.

20:07.281 --> 20:08.447
Well, there is dignity

20:08.599 --> 20:10.666
in being able
to support yourself.

20:12.361 --> 20:14.194
What happened to the cowboy?

20:14.288 --> 20:17.106
Oh, I book more parties if
I have a rotation of characters.

20:17.199 --> 20:18.274
Americano, please.

20:18.276 --> 20:20.459
Now, to find my wallet...

20:20.553 --> 20:22.035
Oh!

20:22.055 --> 20:24.055
