00:12.563 --> 00:14.364
All teams in position.

00:14.365 --> 00:17.266
Team One, you are clear to move in.

00:30.881 --> 00:34.516
Rex Mayfield! Federal agents!

00:36.286 --> 00:39.121
Rex Mayfield!

00:43.827 --> 00:44.928
Men down!

00:44.929 --> 00:46.663
Request immediate medical assistance.

00:46.664 --> 00:48.831
Repeat, multiple men down!
We got movement out back!

00:50.934 --> 00:52.234
Cover back!

01:08.518 --> 01:10.053
It's a beautiful day, boys.

01:10.054 --> 01:13.123
We're all part of the Prophecy.

01:13.124 --> 01:15.457
Isn't that glorious?

01:18.428 --> 01:19.619
Okay, any final

01:19.620 --> 01:20.609
thoughts or concerns

01:20.610 --> 01:23.411
- on the West Africa trip?
- Yeah.

01:23.412 --> 01:25.313
I'm just not seeing it.

01:25.314 --> 01:27.415
Seeing what?

01:27.416 --> 01:28.490
The point of the trip.

01:28.491 --> 01:30.418
The trip that leaves in two hours?

01:30.419 --> 01:32.653
You mean beyond funding clean-energy

01:32.654 --> 01:35.489
partnerships with Nigeria and Senegal

01:35.490 --> 01:37.792
that will bring millions
of Africans electricity?

01:37.793 --> 01:40.194
Thus bolstering two of
the most dynamic nations

01:40.195 --> 01:41.195
in the region?

01:41.196 --> 01:42.763
Not to mention locking in

01:42.764 --> 01:44.265
education and employment initiatives

01:44.266 --> 01:46.500
for women and girls.

01:46.501 --> 01:48.836
Which is key to transforming
developing economies.

01:48.837 --> 01:50.338
So...

01:50.339 --> 01:51.802
you're not seeing the point of that?

01:51.803 --> 01:55.376
This is the first trip
of the new administration.

01:55.377 --> 01:57.612
Indeed, of Dalton's
new Independent party.

01:57.613 --> 01:59.480
There are a lot of eyes on this.

01:59.481 --> 02:01.582
Which is why we're going to Africa.

02:01.583 --> 02:03.985
It has the youngest and fastest-growing

02:03.986 --> 02:05.953
population on Earth.

02:05.954 --> 02:09.223
Africa is literally the future.

02:09.223 --> 02:10.657
Sure. But right now?

02:10.658 --> 02:12.882
Congress only gave us a third
of the money we asked for.

02:12.883 --> 02:14.295
There's a good chance we could go

02:14.296 --> 02:15.863
all the way there and not succeed.

02:15.864 --> 02:20.001
- And also, you hate to fly.
- That's not it.

02:20.002 --> 02:21.836
That's mostly not it.

02:21.837 --> 02:23.771
So your concern, Daisy,

02:23.772 --> 02:25.373
is by going with such fanfare,

02:25.374 --> 02:26.540
if we were to come up short,

02:26.541 --> 02:28.175
it could do a great deal of harm.

02:28.176 --> 02:29.477
To the administration.

02:29.478 --> 02:31.646
And, frankly, to our
long-term goals in Africa.

02:31.647 --> 02:35.082
I hear you, but diplomacy is all about

02:35.083 --> 02:36.584
representing American values

02:36.585 --> 02:38.686
and interests face-to-face.

02:38.687 --> 02:41.155
Sometimes you just have to
get on the plane. Let's go.

02:41.156 --> 02:42.757
Even if it's a broken-down plane

02:42.758 --> 02:45.126
that was never designed
for transcontinental flight.

02:45.127 --> 02:47.628
Shut up. You're not even going.

02:47.629 --> 02:49.130
Which I'm super glad about.

02:49.131 --> 02:51.465
Daisy, don't listen
to him. It's gonna be fun.

02:51.466 --> 02:53.433
Famous last words.

02:55.269 --> 02:58.304
And dinner's served.

03:05.020 --> 03:06.781
Gee, Dad, enchiladas.

03:06.782 --> 03:08.883
Our favorite. Thanks.
You're the best, Dad.

03:08.884 --> 03:10.250
That's okay, kids.

03:10.251 --> 03:12.213
- It makes it all worthwhile...
- Okay. All right.

03:12.214 --> 03:13.477
Just having dinner with you.

03:13.478 --> 03:14.855
- Hi. Hi.
- Okay, fine.

03:14.856 --> 03:16.991
- Hi.
- Look, isn't this nice?

03:16.992 --> 03:19.994
No electronics, a little
human conversation.

03:19.995 --> 03:21.875
Let's try to keep it
going for the seven minutes

03:21.899 --> 03:23.763
it's gonna take us to
wolf down our enchiladas.

03:24.466 --> 03:26.434
You were saying?

03:26.435 --> 03:29.203
All right, okay. Sorry.

03:29.204 --> 03:31.305
I've got to take this.

03:31.306 --> 03:32.840
- Hello?
- Dr. McCord,

03:32.841 --> 03:35.076
it's Marguerite Sanchez from the FBI.

03:35.077 --> 03:36.918
Deputy Director Sanchez,
what can I do for you?

03:36.919 --> 03:38.142
We apprehended a suspect today

03:38.143 --> 03:39.847
whom we believe is responsible

03:39.848 --> 03:42.216
for building the bomb
that was used in the attack

03:42.217 --> 03:43.851
at the coffee shop in Illinois.

03:43.852 --> 03:45.219
Yeah, I saw that on the news.

03:45.220 --> 03:47.141
I think you may have some
knowledge and expertise

03:47.165 --> 03:48.857
that could be helpful
to our investigation.

03:48.858 --> 03:49.642
How so?

03:49.643 --> 03:51.792
I prefer to discuss it in person.

03:51.793 --> 03:53.627
Okay, I can clear
some time on my schedule

03:53.628 --> 03:54.729
tomorrow morning.

03:54.730 --> 03:57.397
I'll be at your house in five minutes.

04:02.636 --> 04:05.672
This is our guy, Rex Mayfield.

04:07.108 --> 04:09.176
He built the bomb that Atif Al-Mutaya

04:09.177 --> 04:10.644
detonated in Illinois?

04:10.645 --> 04:12.313
They met in an ISIS chat room

04:12.314 --> 04:14.915
and made the deal on the Dark Web.

04:14.916 --> 04:17.051
The bomb was fairly sophisticated.

04:17.052 --> 04:19.086
Evidence discovered in Mayfield's barn

04:19.087 --> 04:20.887
links him strongly to that bomb.

04:20.889 --> 04:22.389
Did he have any prior ties to ISIS,

04:22.390 --> 04:24.024
or is he self-radicalized?

04:24.025 --> 04:26.368
That's one of the things we're
hoping you can help us with.

04:26.369 --> 04:28.763
So far, he's not really
saying much that's useful.

04:28.764 --> 04:30.331
Well, look, I would be happy to help,

04:30.332 --> 04:33.667
but you must have experts better
qualified in Islamic extremism.

04:33.668 --> 04:36.403
He also has ties to
another radical group

04:36.404 --> 04:39.205
you're very familiar with.

04:41.075 --> 04:43.611
The Covenant of John?

04:43.612 --> 04:46.213
I haven't heard that name in a while.

04:46.214 --> 04:47.717
Apparently, he's one of the survivors

04:47.718 --> 04:49.356
of the raid on their
compound in Bolivia.

04:49.357 --> 04:51.385
Yeah, I almost wasn't.

04:51.386 --> 04:53.569
We're hoping your experience
with the group can provide

04:53.570 --> 04:55.089
some insight into why

04:55.090 --> 04:57.625
a former member of a
Christian doomsday cult

04:57.626 --> 04:59.293
is selling bombs to ISIS.

04:59.294 --> 05:02.396
Wait. Bombs? Plural?

05:02.397 --> 05:04.598
When we raided his
compound this morning,

05:04.599 --> 05:07.768
we found evidence that
Mayfield recently built a bomb

05:07.769 --> 05:11.305
even larger than the
one he sold to Al-Mutaya.

05:11.306 --> 05:14.275
We don't know where it
is or who may have it.

05:14.276 --> 05:16.943
We need him to tell
us before it goes off.

05:22.616 --> 05:23.951
Science,

05:23.952 --> 05:27.955
technology, engineering, math.

05:27.956 --> 05:30.524
What do all these fields have in common?

05:30.525 --> 05:34.795
Well, for starters, they were
my favorite subjects in school.

05:34.796 --> 05:36.664
And I bet they're yours, too.

05:39.100 --> 05:41.202
They're also subjects that,

05:41.203 --> 05:43.871
as more than one adult told me,

05:43.872 --> 05:47.775
weren't really the right
ones for a girl to care about.

05:47.776 --> 05:50.845
And I bet maybe somebody said
the same thing to you, right?

05:50.846 --> 05:54.481
So it's a good thing
we didn't listen, right?

05:54.482 --> 05:56.550
Yeah.

05:56.551 --> 06:01.522
Instead, you guys came
here from all over Africa...

06:01.523 --> 06:04.692
Togo to Tanzania,
Mozambique to Morocco...

06:04.693 --> 06:07.027
to learn and to make new friends.

06:07.028 --> 06:10.264
Let me tell you about why I love math.

06:10.265 --> 06:13.667
When I was 15, I lost my parents

06:13.668 --> 06:14.835
in a car accident,

06:14.836 --> 06:18.606
and school became my refuge.

06:18.607 --> 06:21.141
Especially math.

06:21.142 --> 06:23.944
Because math... math is elegant.

06:23.945 --> 06:25.813
Math is fun.

06:25.814 --> 06:31.552
And in a chaotic world, math made sense.

06:31.553 --> 06:33.254
Well, maybe not calculus.

06:34.623 --> 06:39.727
So when someone tells you
that math isn't for girls,

06:39.728 --> 06:42.429
or when someone calls you a nerd,

06:42.430 --> 06:46.834
they don't know it, but
they're paying you a compliment.

06:46.835 --> 06:48.469
Because, believe me,

06:48.470 --> 06:51.939
your passion for these fields

06:51.940 --> 06:55.075
will take you places more incredible

06:55.076 --> 06:56.477
than you'd ever dreamed.

06:56.478 --> 06:58.545
And for me, this is one of those places.

06:58.546 --> 07:02.182
So it is an honor to
be here with you today.

07:02.183 --> 07:04.385
Thank you. And I am looking forward

07:04.386 --> 07:06.654
to talking with you
guys about your projects.

07:06.655 --> 07:09.255
Okay?

07:13.327 --> 07:14.795
See? Not so bad.

07:14.796 --> 07:16.830
So far, so good.

07:21.201 --> 07:24.303
Looks like you spoke too soon.

07:28.475 --> 07:32.913
Madam Secretary, I have some bad news.

07:32.914 --> 07:34.815
President Diome,

07:34.816 --> 07:36.517
all of the leg work on the solar farm

07:36.518 --> 07:37.851
has been done.

07:37.852 --> 07:39.820
Why on earth would you turn around

07:39.821 --> 07:42.656
and give the contract to the Chinese?

07:42.657 --> 07:44.658
They offered us better terms.

07:44.659 --> 07:47.161
Let me guess, no money down

07:47.162 --> 07:49.063
in exchange for exclusive rights

07:49.064 --> 07:51.966
to your, what, titanium reserves?

07:51.967 --> 07:54.468
The oil and gas fields
recently discovered

07:54.469 --> 07:56.303
off our coast, actually.

07:56.304 --> 07:57.847
China's been making these deals

07:57.848 --> 07:58.939
all over Africa.

07:58.940 --> 08:00.841
They rarely work out
well for the host nation.

08:00.842 --> 08:01.942
You know that.

08:01.943 --> 08:04.011
The Chinese will
import their own workers

08:04.012 --> 08:06.513
to build the solar farm,
and then, most likely,

08:06.514 --> 08:08.215
they won't train local engineers

08:08.216 --> 08:09.950
to maintain it once they're gone.

08:09.951 --> 08:12.886
So you're looking at five years max

08:12.887 --> 08:16.156
of actual use in exchange for decades

08:16.157 --> 08:19.059
of unfavorable terms on the oil field.

08:19.060 --> 08:21.628
Yes, but Senegal is booming.

08:21.629 --> 08:24.131
We're building an entirely new city

08:24.132 --> 08:25.866
outside of our capital.

08:25.867 --> 08:28.235
We need electricity today.

08:28.236 --> 08:29.670
China can offer that.

08:29.671 --> 08:32.506
You're right, Senegal is booming.

08:32.506 --> 08:34.475
That is why the United
States wants to invest

08:34.476 --> 08:38.145
in diversifying your
economy and your workforce.

08:38.145 --> 08:41.749
Then why didn't your Congress
fund the project fully?

08:41.750 --> 08:43.384
Foreign Minister Chen assured me

08:43.385 --> 08:45.986
that China has no such
problems with cash flow.

08:45.987 --> 08:47.921
When did you speak with Minister Chen?

08:47.922 --> 08:49.589
He came to town yesterday.

08:51.892 --> 08:53.761
Not only did Minister Chen

08:53.762 --> 08:56.630
undercut our deal at the last minute,

08:56.631 --> 08:58.832
he chose to do so

08:58.833 --> 09:00.768
in a very public and embarrassing way.

09:00.769 --> 09:02.403
So he... he trolled us?

09:02.404 --> 09:04.138
Arguably tried to Bigfoot us.

09:04.139 --> 09:05.139
I believe the correct

09:05.140 --> 09:07.674
diplomatic term is he "pantsed" us.

09:07.675 --> 09:08.876
Can I use that quote for the media?

09:08.877 --> 09:10.398
Because the gaggle's already wondering

09:10.422 --> 09:12.513
- what the hell's going on.
- What's going on is

09:12.514 --> 09:14.448
China is sending a message that they are

09:14.449 --> 09:16.650
a bigger player in Africa than we are,

09:16.651 --> 09:18.585
regardless of whether what they're up to

09:18.586 --> 09:20.487
is actually beneficial in the long term.

09:20.488 --> 09:23.424
Call the advance team. Fire up the jet.

09:23.425 --> 09:25.688
Chen knows our itinerary. We
have to beat him to Nigeria.

09:25.689 --> 09:29.424
Let's move. Nobody pantses America.

09:32.232 --> 09:34.935
I know a guy at the
Department of Transportation.

09:34.936 --> 09:36.359
Ironically, he never goes anywhere.

09:36.360 --> 09:37.626
Good for him.

09:39.840 --> 09:41.675
The secretary needs to brief the gaggle.

09:41.676 --> 09:43.811
Nigeria's a giant in the energy sector,

09:43.812 --> 09:45.412
but they're losing out in manufacturing

09:45.413 --> 09:48.315
and human capital due to
their lack of electrification.

09:48.316 --> 09:50.317
- That's the case we need to make.
- Ma'am.

09:50.318 --> 09:52.418
Is it time for you to
tell me you told me so?

09:52.419 --> 09:53.087
No.

09:53.088 --> 09:55.392
But I do think you should go
back and speak to the gaggle.

09:55.393 --> 09:57.558
They want answers about
the change of plans.

09:57.559 --> 10:00.394
I-I'm just a little busy here.

10:00.395 --> 10:02.529
Let's-let's do it
tonight in Abuja, okay?

10:02.530 --> 10:05.298
Yes, ma'am. No problem.

10:06.600 --> 10:08.001
Daisy,

10:08.002 --> 10:10.105
why can't the secretary
just come talk to us herself?

10:10.106 --> 10:11.138
She's 20 feet away.

10:11.139 --> 10:13.073
Believe it or not, Pilar,
the secretary of state

10:13.074 --> 10:15.676
has other things to do than talk to you,

10:15.677 --> 10:17.811
lovely as you all are.

10:17.812 --> 10:19.746
- Go ahead, Ethan.
- Shouldn't the secretary

10:19.747 --> 10:21.849
have anticipated that
China might try to undercut

10:21.850 --> 10:23.009
her initiatives,

10:23.010 --> 10:25.132
especially when the funding
she received from Congress

10:25.133 --> 10:26.556
is so far below what she asked for?

10:26.557 --> 10:28.589
Actually, Ethan, the
secretary is confident

10:28.590 --> 10:30.894
that both her visit and the
initiatives that were launched

10:30.895 --> 10:32.092
will be highly successful,

10:32.093 --> 10:33.476
because they're doing something...

10:33.477 --> 10:36.096
All right, everyone, great talk.

10:36.097 --> 10:38.265
I will address the rest
of your questions later.

10:38.266 --> 10:39.666
Thank you. Bye.

10:39.667 --> 10:41.735
What the hell was that?

10:41.736 --> 10:43.036
Turbulence, right?

10:43.037 --> 10:45.305
- Tell me that was turbulence.
- Mechanical failure.

10:45.306 --> 10:47.218
- Not funny.
- I'm not kidding.

10:47.219 --> 10:47.916
God.

10:47.917 --> 10:49.249
Ladies and gentlemen,

10:49.250 --> 10:50.274
the captain has requested

10:50.275 --> 10:51.845
that you return to your seats

10:51.846 --> 10:55.382
- and fasten your seatbelts.
- So, um, here's the thing, listen,

10:55.383 --> 10:58.285
we kind of lost an engine.

10:58.286 --> 10:59.887
That's not good at all.

10:59.888 --> 11:02.289
We're gonna make an
emergency landing in Togo.

11:02.290 --> 11:03.957
But the thing is, Daisy,

11:03.958 --> 11:06.760
we're not gonna die. Come on.

11:06.761 --> 11:08.362
The odds of us dying in a crash

11:08.363 --> 11:10.264
are 11 million to one.

11:10.265 --> 11:13.800
That's slightly lower than
getting killed by lightning,

11:13.801 --> 11:17.337
but admittedly higher than being
killed by a falling coconut.

11:17.338 --> 11:20.841
But, look, the point is,

11:20.842 --> 11:23.710
the chances of us dying in a crash

11:23.711 --> 11:26.747
are astronomically improbable.

11:26.748 --> 11:28.515
We're gonna be fine.

11:30.351 --> 11:31.685
No offense, ma'am,

11:31.686 --> 11:33.587
that would all be much more comforting

11:33.588 --> 11:36.089
to a math major, so if you
don't mind, I'm just gonna

11:36.090 --> 11:37.457
close my eyes now.

11:37.458 --> 11:39.459
Sure.

11:57.482 --> 11:59.402
You're going to prison
for the rest of your life.

11:59.403 --> 12:01.203
But if you tell us
where the other bomb is,

12:01.204 --> 12:03.372
we can take death off the table.

12:03.373 --> 12:07.775
I'd argue death
has a mind of its own.

12:08.464 --> 12:10.465
Where's the other bomb, Rex?

12:10.466 --> 12:12.200
Don't know.

12:12.201 --> 12:16.704
But like you, I'm all
atwitter to find out.

12:16.705 --> 12:19.674
You said you built the bombs
to bring about the prophecy.

12:19.675 --> 12:21.509
Which prophecy is that?

12:21.510 --> 12:22.710
Well, that would be

12:22.711 --> 12:24.879
the final battle between the Crusaders

12:24.880 --> 12:25.847
and the Faithful

12:25.848 --> 12:27.849
on the plains of Dubuque.

12:27.850 --> 12:30.585
And what have you.

12:30.586 --> 12:32.487
Dubuque, Iowa?

12:32.488 --> 12:34.071
- Dabiq, Syria.
- Henry McCord,

12:34.072 --> 12:36.658
Special Agent Mohammed
Maloof, Counter-Terrorism.

12:36.659 --> 12:38.819
Great to meet you, Dr. McCord.
Familiar with your work.

12:38.820 --> 12:40.300
- You can call me Mo.
- Henry, please.

12:40.324 --> 12:41.963
Dabiq is a town in northern Syria

12:41.964 --> 12:44.805
that devout members of ISIS believe
will be the site of the final battle

12:44.829 --> 12:46.935
with the West that will
usher in the apocalypse.

12:46.936 --> 12:48.603
So why did he mispronounce it?

12:48.604 --> 12:50.505
Is he joking or ignorant?

12:50.506 --> 12:52.707
Either or both.

12:52.708 --> 12:54.375
After listening to him talk all night,

12:54.376 --> 12:56.159
I'm not convinced he's
a particularly devoted

12:56.160 --> 12:57.045
convert to Islam.

12:57.046 --> 12:58.746
But does that necessarily mean

12:58.747 --> 13:00.815
he wouldn't give a second bomb to ISIS?

13:00.816 --> 13:02.116
What's up, Mo?

13:02.117 --> 13:03.151
Now we're still mapping.

13:03.152 --> 13:04.652
Mayfield's communications,

13:04.653 --> 13:06.821
but he seems to have tried to reach out

13:06.822 --> 13:10.859
to a few other Covenant
of John survivors.

13:11.827 --> 13:14.696
What about known
Islamic State operatives

13:14.697 --> 13:16.598
or sympathizers?

13:16.599 --> 13:18.032
After Al-Mutaya, none.

13:18.033 --> 13:19.801
If the first bomb

13:19.802 --> 13:22.136
was for them, odds
are the second is too.

13:22.137 --> 13:23.471
Then I'm curious

13:23.472 --> 13:26.074
why he would contact
members of his old cult.

13:26.075 --> 13:27.341
So am I.

13:30.412 --> 13:32.447
Thanks, Scott, we owe you one.

13:32.448 --> 13:34.282
Yeah, all right,
thanks, talk to you soon.

13:34.283 --> 13:36.417
All right, the good news is

13:36.418 --> 13:38.753
the Ops Center got us all
booked on a commercial flight

13:38.754 --> 13:39.954
to Nigeria on Air Abuja.

13:39.955 --> 13:41.022
That's an airline?

13:41.023 --> 13:42.624
What's the bad news?

13:42.625 --> 13:44.893
Yes, the bad news is
it leaves in 20 minutes

13:44.894 --> 13:47.028
from the opposite end of the terminal.

13:47.029 --> 13:48.796
- Then we better hustle. We ready?
- Yeah.

13:48.797 --> 13:50.698
- Yeah.
- Okay, let's go.

13:50.699 --> 13:52.600
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.

13:52.601 --> 13:55.102
Okay.

13:59.675 --> 14:00.742
Come on.

14:00.743 --> 14:02.610
Yeah, we're gonna miss that flight.

14:02.611 --> 14:04.279
Madam Secretary,

14:04.280 --> 14:05.613
welcome to Togo.

14:05.614 --> 14:08.950
Mr. President, what-what
a pleasure to be here.

14:08.951 --> 14:09.918
Thank you.

14:09.919 --> 14:11.586
It will be my great honor

14:11.587 --> 14:13.555
to show you the sights of LomÃ©,

14:13.556 --> 14:15.323
our beautiful capital city.

14:15.324 --> 14:16.824
- Please come with me.
- Okay.

14:16.825 --> 14:18.927
He knows this isn't an
official state visit, right?

14:18.928 --> 14:20.962
It is now.

14:20.963 --> 14:23.197
The secretary of state

14:23.198 --> 14:27.502
is on an extremely
high-profile, official trip,

14:27.503 --> 14:28.970
and you're telling me that

14:28.971 --> 14:32.206
the soonest you can get her
plane fixed is next week?

14:32.207 --> 14:33.441
Affirmative.

14:33.442 --> 14:35.009
Because the replacement part

14:35.010 --> 14:37.645
is being held in
reserve for another plane

14:37.646 --> 14:39.814
which might go down but hasn't?

14:39.815 --> 14:41.349
Affirmative.

14:41.350 --> 14:43.518
Surely, Major Farkis, you
can see that makes no sense.

14:43.519 --> 14:44.552
Negative.

14:44.553 --> 14:45.687
Negative.

14:45.688 --> 14:47.288
Right, it makes negative sense.

14:47.289 --> 14:49.023
I'm glad you agree.

14:49.024 --> 14:50.967
Ma'am, the issue is that
the high compressor drum

14:50.968 --> 14:54.162
requires special MHE before
we reroute it to the APOE.

14:54.163 --> 14:55.663
I've pulsed the AMC for guidance.

14:55.664 --> 14:58.132
Why can't these people speak English?

14:58.133 --> 15:00.196
'Cause then we could
understand what they're saying.

15:00.197 --> 15:01.502
I hate the Pentagon so much.

15:01.503 --> 15:04.038
Major Farkis, what I
believe you are saying to me,

15:04.039 --> 15:07.108
with all these ridiculous acronyms,

15:07.109 --> 15:10.144
is that it's a really big part

15:10.145 --> 15:12.814
and it would be very hard to move it.

15:12.815 --> 15:14.916
I've pulsed the AMC for guidance.

15:14.917 --> 15:17.118
Haven't we all?

15:17.119 --> 15:18.720
One last question, Major.

15:18.721 --> 15:22.123
Your commanding officer
is Colonel McKay, correct?

15:22.124 --> 15:23.358
Affirmative.

15:23.359 --> 15:25.460
Okay, well, I'm just gonna
go ahead and pulse him.

15:25.461 --> 15:26.728
Thank you, Major.

15:26.729 --> 15:28.229
Over and out.

15:28.230 --> 15:30.494
I don't think you say "over
and out" to end a phone call.

15:30.495 --> 15:31.733
It felt right.

15:31.734 --> 15:33.934
Get your things, we're
going to the Pentagon.

15:35.270 --> 15:38.072
As you can see, Madam Secretary,

15:38.073 --> 15:40.475
our nation has a rich history.

15:40.476 --> 15:42.010
It's very impressive.

15:42.011 --> 15:44.445
But our future will
be even more impressive.

15:44.446 --> 15:47.649
Wait until you see our new
telecommunications center.

15:47.650 --> 15:49.951
Ooh, President Fabre,

15:49.952 --> 15:51.753
would you excuse me just for one second?

15:51.754 --> 15:52.987
Of course.

15:52.988 --> 15:55.556
- Gosh, this is...
- Isn't this beautiful?

15:55.557 --> 15:57.225
- This is really beautiful.
- This a nice one? Yes.

15:57.226 --> 15:57.909
What's up?

15:57.910 --> 15:59.974
There's a flight that leaves
to Nigeria in one hour.

15:59.975 --> 16:00.633
Great.

16:00.634 --> 16:02.234
But there are only four seats available.

16:02.258 --> 16:03.798
- Less great.
- In coach.

16:03.799 --> 16:05.800
- Not great at all, but we'll deal.
- Yeah.

16:05.801 --> 16:07.869
Four seats. That's you,

16:07.870 --> 16:10.054
and a minimum detail of two
Diplomatic Security agents,

16:10.055 --> 16:10.705
and Blake.

16:10.706 --> 16:13.107
Daisy and I will bring the
gaggle as soon as we can.

16:13.108 --> 16:14.188
- Wait, wait, ma'am.
- What?

16:14.189 --> 16:16.882
They're already smelling blood in the
water, now you want me to spend the night

16:16.883 --> 16:18.476
in Togo while you jet off to Nigeria?

16:18.477 --> 16:19.447
They're gonna mutiny.

16:19.448 --> 16:20.940
- Well, I know it stinks, Daisy...
- Admire the statue.

16:20.941 --> 16:22.446
Just admire the statue.

16:22.447 --> 16:25.082
And on top of everything
else, Minister Chen is probably

16:25.083 --> 16:27.018
already in Nigeria eating our lunch.

16:27.019 --> 16:29.453
Speaking of lunches, did we have lunch?

16:29.454 --> 16:30.629
We did not have lunch.

16:30.630 --> 16:32.290
- No wonder I want lunch.
- Look, stop saying "lunch."

16:32.291 --> 16:34.025
Look, Daisy, part of your
job is to take the hits, okay?

16:34.026 --> 16:35.393
So I need you to cover my ass

16:35.394 --> 16:37.137
while Blake and I make
a run for this plane,

16:37.138 --> 16:40.865
- okay? Thank you.
- Yes, absolutely, ma'am.

16:40.866 --> 16:43.835
Mr. President, regrettably,
I have to take my leave.

16:43.836 --> 16:47.371
But Assistant Secretary Thompson

16:47.372 --> 16:50.041
and my spokeswoman, Daisy Grant,

16:50.042 --> 16:51.665
are very much looking
forward to visiting

16:51.666 --> 16:52.910
that telecommunications center.

16:52.911 --> 16:55.479
You have been such a gracious host.

16:55.480 --> 16:56.848
No, the pleasure was all mine.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.683
Well, thank you so much.

16:58.684 --> 17:00.618
God bless Togo.

17:00.619 --> 17:01.786
Okay, thank you.

17:01.787 --> 17:04.622
- Thank you.
- Okay.

17:04.623 --> 17:07.090
Where is the secretary going, Daisy?

17:07.092 --> 17:09.760
Ethan, isn't the more relevant
question, where is Togo going?

17:09.761 --> 17:12.262
- No, that's an absurd question.
- And we're gonna find out

17:12.263 --> 17:15.265
some pretty exciting answers on
the next stop on our tour, okay?

17:19.404 --> 17:21.836
This is nice. It's cozy.

17:21.837 --> 17:23.559
Well, just to remind you, ma'am,

17:23.560 --> 17:24.661
we won't have secure comms

17:24.662 --> 17:27.009
until we reach your motorcade in Abuja.

17:27.010 --> 17:29.044
So we're off the grid.

17:29.045 --> 17:32.815
Flying blind into an
unpredictable situation.

17:33.817 --> 17:36.652
Hey, that's diplomacy, right?

17:36.653 --> 17:39.188
At least we're finally
gonna get something to eat.

17:39.189 --> 17:40.322
Ma'am,

17:40.323 --> 17:42.324
I am so sorry, it turns out they are not

17:42.325 --> 17:44.693
serving a meal, even
though it clearly stated so

17:44.694 --> 17:45.794
on our tickets.

17:45.795 --> 17:47.696
All they have are
peanuts or plantain chips.

17:47.697 --> 17:49.464
- Thanks, Blake.
- Yeah, okay.

17:50.606 --> 17:51.967
Matt, I'm sorry, could I just...?

17:51.968 --> 17:53.951
You know what? Stay where
you are, I'll come over.

17:53.952 --> 17:54.903
Sorry.

17:54.904 --> 17:56.472
Ooh! Sorry.

17:56.473 --> 17:57.573
Okay.

17:58.942 --> 18:01.275
- Hair.
- Sorry. Okay.

18:03.946 --> 18:06.882
You know, I actually
think it's a good thing

18:06.883 --> 18:09.118
that we're flying commercial.

18:09.119 --> 18:10.919
How so, ma'am?

18:10.920 --> 18:13.522
'Cause it sends the message
that the United States

18:13.523 --> 18:16.258
isn't hung up on the trappings of power.

18:16.259 --> 18:17.459
Why?

18:17.460 --> 18:19.595
Because we have the power of our ideas.

18:21.598 --> 18:23.699
China's trying to flex
its muscles in Nigeria

18:23.700 --> 18:25.283
and we're gonna have to deal with that,

18:25.284 --> 18:26.602
but everybody knows

18:26.603 --> 18:28.604
it takes real strength to be humble.

18:28.605 --> 18:31.273
Yes, ma'am.

18:33.310 --> 18:35.944
Are you gonna eat those?

18:35.945 --> 18:37.813
Starving.

18:37.814 --> 18:39.847
Thank you so much.

18:46.219 --> 18:49.053
As I've already stated, the
nearest replacement component

18:49.054 --> 18:50.437
for the secretary's plane is at...

18:50.438 --> 18:52.590
Is at Aviano Air Base in Italy, yes.

18:52.591 --> 18:54.392
And it's being held in reserve for...

18:54.393 --> 18:57.429
Another plane that might
need it but doesn't.

18:57.430 --> 18:59.669
Colonel, I'm sure you get as frustrated

18:59.670 --> 19:01.969
with those cheapskates
in Congress as I do.

19:01.970 --> 19:03.670
Goodness sakes, they won't even give

19:03.671 --> 19:05.872
the secretary of state a plane

19:05.873 --> 19:07.974
that's designed for
trans-continental flight.

19:07.975 --> 19:09.442
Of course it's going to break down.

19:09.443 --> 19:13.046
But now America looks bad.

19:13.047 --> 19:14.881
So why don't you do me this favor,

19:14.882 --> 19:17.083
and let's help the secretary get back

19:17.084 --> 19:18.952
to doing America's business?

19:18.953 --> 19:20.420
I can be a very good person

19:20.421 --> 19:21.988
to know in this town.

19:21.989 --> 19:23.923
Unfortunately, ma'am,

19:23.924 --> 19:26.493
the Air Force doesn't run on favors.

19:26.494 --> 19:28.395
My hands are tied.

19:28.396 --> 19:30.764
So, if that'll be all...

19:30.765 --> 19:35.435
State Department officials actually

19:35.436 --> 19:37.003
carry equivalent military ranks.

19:37.004 --> 19:38.238
Guess what mine is.

19:38.239 --> 19:40.005
Major?

19:40.507 --> 19:42.108
Colonel, like me.

19:42.109 --> 19:43.710
Not even close.

19:43.711 --> 19:45.545
Although, technically, I think,

19:45.546 --> 19:47.514
- I'm a full-bird colonel.
- Ha, look at that.

19:47.515 --> 19:49.149
A full-bird colonel.

19:49.150 --> 19:51.017
You don't even outrank the speechwriter.

19:51.018 --> 19:52.718
You don't have to say "even".

19:52.719 --> 19:56.723
I am, in fact, a major general.

19:56.724 --> 19:58.858
As such, I'm giving you a direct order:

19:58.859 --> 20:03.596
Sign those forms and get that
part from Italy to Togo today.

20:03.597 --> 20:04.964
Do you read me, Colonel?

20:04.965 --> 20:08.802
Those ranks aren't part of
the actual chain of command.

20:08.803 --> 20:10.870
Well, is that right?

20:10.871 --> 20:12.592
Well, you know who
might settle that for us,

20:12.593 --> 20:14.897
is the commander-in-chief.
May I borrow your phone please?

20:14.898 --> 20:18.178
I will get the part
for you, ma'am, ASAP.

20:18.179 --> 20:19.646
Then we're done here.

20:19.647 --> 20:21.214
Good day, Colonel.

20:21.215 --> 20:23.415
Good day.

20:28.922 --> 20:31.324
We've been offline for two hours.

20:31.325 --> 20:33.493
And we're a half-day behind Chen.

20:33.494 --> 20:35.528
With any luck, the
Nigerians will remember

20:35.529 --> 20:38.565
all of our support
on HIV/AIDS and Ebola.

20:38.566 --> 20:40.934
And malaria, and counter-terrorism.

20:40.935 --> 20:43.936
They know who their friends are.

20:46.306 --> 20:47.707
Or not.

20:47.708 --> 20:48.775
Madam Secretary.

20:48.776 --> 20:50.143
Wow.

20:50.144 --> 20:53.746
The Nigerians really
rolled out the red carpet.

20:53.747 --> 20:55.281
- Welcome to Abuja.
- Thank you.

20:55.282 --> 20:57.484
Madam Ambassador, thank you.

20:57.485 --> 20:59.385
Apologies for the
small reception, ma'am.

20:59.386 --> 21:01.321
Apparently President Akinagbe

21:01.322 --> 21:03.857
had some urgent business to attend to.

21:03.858 --> 21:06.359
Is there any chance we're still all set

21:06.360 --> 21:09.028
for the announcement about
the wind power project?

21:09.029 --> 21:10.029
About that...

21:10.030 --> 21:11.464
I wanted to get in touch earlier,

21:11.465 --> 21:13.769
but since you were flying
commercial, you lacked secure...

21:13.770 --> 21:14.634
Secure comms, yeah.

21:14.635 --> 21:16.803
I'm sensing there's been a hiccup.

21:16.804 --> 21:18.147
You're not going to believe this.

21:18.148 --> 21:20.940
I bet I will.

21:30.550 --> 21:33.353
And this is our room for secure comms.

21:33.354 --> 21:35.188
You can contact Foggy
Bottom or the secretary

21:35.189 --> 21:36.089
safely from here.

21:36.090 --> 21:38.057
Excellent. Thank you, Darren.

21:38.058 --> 21:40.360
And this is also where
you'll be sleeping tonight.

21:40.361 --> 21:42.295
- Ooh.
- What?

21:42.296 --> 21:43.630
Yeah. See the thing is,

21:43.631 --> 21:45.598
there's a big soccer tournament in town,

21:45.599 --> 21:47.300
and all the hotels are booked up,

21:47.301 --> 21:49.335
and there is literally
not a single room available

21:49.336 --> 21:51.004
in all of LomÃ©. I am so sorry.

21:51.005 --> 21:53.239
We've been traveling
for 20 hours straight.

21:53.240 --> 21:55.074
Can't we stay at the
ambassador's residence?

21:55.075 --> 21:56.709
You could, but his kids

21:56.710 --> 21:59.212
have the stomach flu, so...

21:59.213 --> 22:01.247
We picked a really bad time
to crash-land in Togo?

22:01.248 --> 22:03.316
Okay, where do I put the
press traveling with us?

22:03.317 --> 22:04.717
The Ops Center is into it, but...

22:04.718 --> 22:06.219
they're kind of on their own.

22:06.220 --> 22:08.788
These people are tough. A lot
of them have covered war zones.

22:08.789 --> 22:10.156
Which is where I'll be when I tell them

22:10.157 --> 22:11.391
they don't have a
place to sleep tonight.

22:11.392 --> 22:12.855
They'll be fine. Take a deep breath.

22:12.856 --> 22:14.467
This trip is coming
off the rails, Susan,

22:14.468 --> 22:16.029
- just like I said it would.
- Okay.

22:16.030 --> 22:18.364
So, a trip to Africa turned
out to be complicated.

22:18.365 --> 22:19.933
Congratulations, Nostradamus.

22:19.934 --> 22:21.167
You didn't see it coming.

22:21.168 --> 22:22.902
Really? That's where
you want to take this?

22:22.903 --> 22:24.237
Okay.

22:24.238 --> 22:26.072
So... should I have your luggage

22:26.073 --> 22:27.840
brought up here or...?

22:27.841 --> 22:29.875
- Yeah. Why not?
- That'll be fine.

22:35.348 --> 22:37.283
Jenny Bach?

22:37.284 --> 22:38.718
Yeah?

22:38.719 --> 22:40.887
I'm Special Agent Maloof from the FBI,

22:40.888 --> 22:43.056
- And this is...
- I remember you...

22:43.057 --> 22:44.224
from Bolivia.

22:44.225 --> 22:48.695
Henry. I'm glad you made it out okay.

22:48.696 --> 22:51.264
Yeah, from a doomsday cult right
back to my parents' guest room.

22:51.265 --> 22:54.767
I am totally crushing this life thing.

22:54.768 --> 22:56.402
I guess...

22:56.403 --> 22:57.837
this is about Rex.

22:57.838 --> 22:59.137
I saw him on the news.

23:00.240 --> 23:02.108
Come on in.

23:02.109 --> 23:03.142
Thank you.

23:03.143 --> 23:05.410
Thank you.

23:08.915 --> 23:10.817
How well do you remember Rex?

23:10.818 --> 23:12.952
Well, we spent every
waking hour together

23:12.953 --> 23:14.120
in the mountains of Bolivia

23:14.121 --> 23:15.455
praying for the end of the world,

23:15.456 --> 23:18.725
so, you know, pretty well.

23:18.726 --> 23:20.829
He tried calling your old
phone number several times.

23:20.830 --> 23:24.030
Look, I don't want anything
to do with those people, okay?

23:24.031 --> 23:26.532
I have a job. I can finally sleep again.

23:26.533 --> 23:28.333
Don't worry. We're just talking.

23:29.869 --> 23:31.671
So, what do you think Rex wants?

23:31.672 --> 23:33.706
Probably nothing good.

23:33.707 --> 23:35.808
He was a weird guy.

23:35.809 --> 23:37.610
Obviously.

23:37.611 --> 23:40.913
Did he really make a bomb for ISIS?

23:40.914 --> 23:43.016
Does that surprise you?

23:43.017 --> 23:46.119
The ISIS part, yeah. The bomb part, no.

23:46.120 --> 23:48.254
You don't think he'd convert to Islam?

23:48.255 --> 23:50.556
Rex was hard-core into the Covenant,

23:50.557 --> 23:51.958
the end-times prophecy,

23:51.959 --> 23:53.559
the rapture to come, all that stuff,

23:53.560 --> 23:55.528
even more than the reverend.

23:55.529 --> 23:57.897
And the bomb?

23:57.898 --> 24:01.067
I mean, those ISIS types
want to blow up the world,

24:01.068 --> 24:03.536
and that was definitely on Rex's agenda.

24:03.537 --> 24:05.471
But not on Reverend Finch's.

24:05.472 --> 24:07.707
He thought the Covenant
should welcome the apocalypse,

24:07.708 --> 24:09.075
but not cause it.

24:09.076 --> 24:11.277
Yeah, well, that's where Rex
and the reverend disagreed.

24:11.278 --> 24:13.579
He thought we should follow Revelation:

24:13.580 --> 24:16.101
- "Go your ways and pour out the vials..."
- "Pour out the vials

24:16.125 --> 24:18.121
of the wrath of God upon the earth."

24:20.920 --> 24:24.189
If you remember anything
else, please give us a call.

24:26.693 --> 24:28.960
Um... Henry?

24:30.496 --> 24:34.367
My parents had to
take out a double mortgage

24:34.368 --> 24:37.337
on this house to get me deprogrammed...

24:37.338 --> 24:40.740
and, I lost custody of my daughter.

24:40.741 --> 24:43.975
My life's, like, a complete disaster...

24:45.611 --> 24:50.083
but still, I am so
glad to have it back.

24:50.084 --> 24:53.853
So, thank you.

24:53.854 --> 24:55.487
You're welcome.

24:57.957 --> 25:00.560
Whatever Rex is doing...

25:00.561 --> 25:02.694
stop him.

25:13.606 --> 25:15.974
Wait here.

25:17.009 --> 25:19.679
Foreign Minister Chen.

25:19.680 --> 25:22.181
Madam Secretary, welcome to Nigeria.

25:22.182 --> 25:24.449
A word?

25:28.488 --> 25:30.656
Ming, if you're trying
to send me a message,

25:30.657 --> 25:34.093
you don't have to follow
me all over Africa.

25:34.094 --> 25:37.029
Why, you could have just called.

25:37.030 --> 25:40.032
I'm simply offering Senegal
and Nigeria competitive deals...

25:40.033 --> 25:42.368
for the benefit of both parties.

25:42.369 --> 25:43.870
So, they get a wind farm,

25:43.871 --> 25:47.774
you get 100-year leases on oil and gas.

25:47.775 --> 25:49.242
Sounds fair.

25:49.243 --> 25:51.310
At least they get the wind farm...

25:51.311 --> 25:54.480
instead of empty promises
and hypocritical lecturing

25:54.481 --> 25:56.984
from western countries who have
undermined Africa for centur...

25:56.985 --> 26:00.286
The United States is trying
very hard to turn the page,

26:00.287 --> 26:03.656
and be a force for
constructive engagement.

26:03.657 --> 26:06.926
Cleaner energy, economic diversification

26:06.927 --> 26:08.728
and greater transparency,

26:08.729 --> 26:10.696
educating and empowering
women and girls.

26:10.697 --> 26:13.199
Spare me your idealism.

26:13.200 --> 26:15.734
More importantly, spare Africa.

26:16.836 --> 26:19.205
I lived through the Cultural Revolution.

26:19.206 --> 26:21.407
My father was not so lucky.

26:21.408 --> 26:22.408
Idealism kills.

26:22.669 --> 26:25.766
Mutual interests save lives.

26:26.755 --> 26:28.644
I'm sorry about your father.

26:29.232 --> 26:31.397
I lost my parents young, too.

26:31.620 --> 26:33.645
Yes, I know.

26:33.921 --> 26:38.308
I'm... sorry as well.

26:41.356 --> 26:43.290
Damn it.

26:45.260 --> 26:46.461
Now we're gonna have to start

26:46.462 --> 26:48.895
seeing each other as human beings.

26:53.434 --> 26:55.217
Can you just imagine
what we could accomplish

26:55.218 --> 26:56.704
if we worked together?

26:56.705 --> 27:00.108
Don't pretend your interests
are so pure, Madam Secretary.

27:00.109 --> 27:02.744
I heard about your
little detour to Togo.

27:02.745 --> 27:04.312
Our plane broke down.

27:04.313 --> 27:06.047
It was an emergency landing.

27:06.048 --> 27:08.950
Really?

27:08.951 --> 27:11.819
Yes, really. Togo wasn't even

27:11.820 --> 27:13.554
on our itinerary.

27:13.555 --> 27:15.890
Why would I lie about
having to land there?

27:15.891 --> 27:17.759
Even if I were to believe
that the world's most

27:17.760 --> 27:21.629
powerful diplomat would
travel in a run-down plane...

27:21.630 --> 27:24.465
- Well...
- which I do not...

27:24.466 --> 27:26.734
how do you explain the fanfare.

27:26.735 --> 27:30.037
President Fabre gave you at the airport?

27:30.805 --> 27:33.675
Fine. Believe whatever you want.

27:33.676 --> 27:36.544
I will.

27:36.545 --> 27:39.847
Namely, that more phosphate
has been discovered in Togo,

27:39.848 --> 27:41.783
and a U.S. company

27:41.784 --> 27:43.418
plans to mine it.

27:43.419 --> 27:46.054
Now, if you'll excuse me,

27:46.055 --> 27:47.722
I have a celebration to return to.

27:47.723 --> 27:50.124
By all means.

27:50.125 --> 27:53.360
It was nice chatting with you.

27:57.532 --> 27:59.901
So, he actually believes
we're here to strike a deal,

27:59.902 --> 28:01.669
and not because our
crappy plane broke down?

28:01.670 --> 28:04.872
Apparently, but the good
news is, we can use this.

28:04.873 --> 28:05.975
To do what?

28:06.047 --> 28:08.176
Actually accomplish something
positive on this trip.

28:08.177 --> 28:09.544
Just sit tight, I'll see you soon.

28:09.545 --> 28:10.912
All right.

28:10.913 --> 28:12.313
Blake, wake up.

28:12.314 --> 28:14.449
We're going back to Togo.

28:14.450 --> 28:15.650
Togo?

28:15.651 --> 28:17.717
Wait...

28:27.769 --> 28:31.186
I am so sorry that I had to
leave before I got a chance

28:31.187 --> 28:32.513
to meet with you

28:32.514 --> 28:34.863
and-and see your
project back in Senegal.

28:34.864 --> 28:36.430
But... what do you have here?

28:36.431 --> 28:40.835
Madam Secretary, as you
know, open-flame cooking has

28:40.836 --> 28:43.938
negative health effects for
women and the environment,

28:43.939 --> 28:47.274
but solar cookers were
not readily available,

28:47.275 --> 28:49.477
so we did research on the Internet

28:49.478 --> 28:51.746
and designed our own,

28:51.747 --> 28:56.383
out of material available here in Togo.

28:56.384 --> 28:58.451
Wow.

28:59.653 --> 29:04.358
We would like to present
you, a proud fellow nerd...

29:06.228 --> 29:08.028
with our prototype.

29:08.029 --> 29:10.464
Wow. Thank you. That is...

29:10.465 --> 29:13.834
that is so... nerd cool.

29:13.835 --> 29:15.302
I can't even tell you.

29:15.303 --> 29:16.537
Thank you very much.

29:16.538 --> 29:19.373
I will... I'll send you
pictures of the first meal

29:19.374 --> 29:20.508
that I cook with it.

29:20.509 --> 29:23.443
Thank you very much. Thank you.

29:24.145 --> 29:25.980
Excellent job.

29:25.981 --> 29:28.882
- Can we take picture?
- Of course.

29:31.118 --> 29:33.786
Thank you. Thank you
very much. Thank you.

29:35.556 --> 29:38.759
Two visits in as many days.

29:38.760 --> 29:40.294
I'm honored, Madam Secretary,

29:40.295 --> 29:43.297
but I must confess, a bit surprised.

29:43.298 --> 29:45.266
Mr. President.

29:45.267 --> 29:47.802
I came back to discuss a deal with you

29:47.803 --> 29:50.337
that could bring significant
investment to Togo.

29:50.338 --> 29:52.673
Might even provide
jobs for them one day.

29:52.674 --> 29:55.943
That would be wonderful...

29:55.944 --> 29:58.012
but U.S., historically,

29:58.013 --> 30:00.181
has avoided investing heavily in Togo.

30:00.182 --> 30:01.382
Why the change?

30:01.383 --> 30:02.416
You notice I didn't say,

30:02.417 --> 30:05.686
"significant American investment."

30:05.687 --> 30:07.888
Now I am officially intrigued.

30:07.889 --> 30:11.292
You want responsible foreign investment

30:11.293 --> 30:12.893
that lifts up the Togolese people.

30:12.894 --> 30:14.195
So do we.

30:14.196 --> 30:16.997
China wants to beat us by
outspending us in Africa.

30:18.233 --> 30:21.735
I think there might be a way
we can all get what we want.

30:23.785 --> 30:25.840
Hopefully, they'll buy what
the secretary's selling.

30:25.841 --> 30:27.842
We'll see soon enough.

30:27.843 --> 30:31.545
Listen, we're off the clock
for a little while later today,

30:31.546 --> 30:34.582
and I was gonna go someplace
you might find interesting.

30:34.583 --> 30:35.950
Would you like to come along?

30:35.951 --> 30:38.385
Okay. Sure.

30:38.386 --> 30:40.219
- Okay.
- Thanks.

30:44.892 --> 30:47.027
Well, look who it is.

30:47.028 --> 30:48.329
The interloper.

30:48.330 --> 30:51.497
The deceiver.

30:52.233 --> 30:53.567
That was quite an experience

30:53.568 --> 30:54.802
we had in Bolivia.

30:54.803 --> 30:59.139
It all worked out
according to God's will.

30:59.140 --> 31:01.675
Speaking of God's will,

31:01.676 --> 31:05.912
remind me, what are the
Five Pillars of Islam?

31:06.647 --> 31:08.716
What?

31:08.717 --> 31:10.384
Why is Al Masjid Al Aqsa

31:10.385 --> 31:12.386
significant to Muslims?

31:12.387 --> 31:15.256
The Dome of the Rock

31:15.257 --> 31:17.523
where the Prophet Muhammad
ascended into heaven.

31:19.360 --> 31:21.828
Peace be upon him.

31:22.463 --> 31:23.631
That's what you say

31:23.632 --> 31:25.399
when the prophet's name is mentioned.

31:25.400 --> 31:27.001
Congratulations, Mr. Mayfield.

31:27.002 --> 31:28.335
You are officially not a Muslim.

31:28.336 --> 31:29.737
That didn't take long.

31:29.738 --> 31:30.771
Much shorter than it took

31:30.772 --> 31:32.039
to prove that Reverend Finch

31:32.040 --> 31:33.741
didn't understand the first thing

31:33.742 --> 31:34.925
about the Book of Revelation.

31:34.926 --> 31:37.077
You watch what you say now.

31:37.078 --> 31:39.280
The reverend was a brilliant man.

31:39.281 --> 31:41.882
He really wasn't.

31:41.883 --> 31:43.117
In just two hours,

31:43.118 --> 31:44.861
he was questioning
everything he'd told you.

31:44.862 --> 31:47.721
Liar. His faith was strong...

31:47.722 --> 31:49.356
and so is mine.

31:49.357 --> 31:52.660
Which faith? Your pretensions to Islam

31:52.661 --> 31:54.028
or your misguided Christian cult?

31:54.029 --> 31:57.731
You know, Finch should
have really listened to you,

31:57.732 --> 31:59.133
taken steps to bring about the end.

31:59.134 --> 32:00.234
But, as I said,

32:00.235 --> 32:02.303
he had doubts about
the entire enterprise.

32:02.304 --> 32:04.305
So, in my

32:04.306 --> 32:06.206
professional opinion,

32:06.207 --> 32:08.574
you've made some grievous
theological errors, Rex.

32:10.177 --> 32:13.147
Just you wait and see.

32:13.148 --> 32:15.316
I am the Lord's messenger.

32:15.317 --> 32:16.984
I ride upon the pale horse.

32:16.985 --> 32:19.353
My angels are legion.

32:19.354 --> 32:21.355
And they will go their ways...

32:21.356 --> 32:24.325
"And pour out the vials of the
wrath of God upon the earth."

32:25.727 --> 32:27.404
Thank you. You've been very helpful.

32:33.568 --> 32:36.537
So he's still Covenant of John.

32:36.538 --> 32:38.138
He's more than that.

32:38.139 --> 32:40.174
He sees himself as the
architect of the apocalypse.

32:40.175 --> 32:42.109
And I think he believes
that the way to do that

32:42.110 --> 32:45.879
is to foment a cataclysmic
war between Islam and the West.

32:45.880 --> 32:47.348
Hence making the bomb for ISIS.

32:47.349 --> 32:49.083
He wants to motivate both sides.

32:49.084 --> 32:50.951
But he wants us to chase ISIS,

32:50.952 --> 32:53.988
because at least a few of the
surviving cult members will be

32:53.989 --> 32:55.689
his "legion of angels,"

32:55.690 --> 32:57.124
and help him start the war.

32:57.125 --> 32:58.908
We need to track down
the remaining followers

32:58.909 --> 33:00.527
of the Covenant of John.

33:00.528 --> 33:03.696
One of them has the second bomb.

33:09.269 --> 33:10.571
First, the Europeans

33:10.572 --> 33:12.339
called this part of West Africa,

33:12.340 --> 33:14.808
the Gold Coast,

33:14.809 --> 33:17.244
and then after, of course,

33:17.245 --> 33:19.413
the Slave Coast.

33:19.414 --> 33:22.683
They built forts like
this up and down the coast

33:22.684 --> 33:25.985
to hoard what they came to take.

33:30.825 --> 33:33.427
Sorry. It's just really emotional.

33:33.428 --> 33:34.795
I know.

33:34.796 --> 33:37.831
The psalm says,

33:37.832 --> 33:41.835
"By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat.

33:41.836 --> 33:46.540
And yea, we wept when
we remembered Zion."

33:46.541 --> 33:50.010
You think you understand it,

33:50.011 --> 33:53.147
then you come to a place
like this, and you just...

33:53.148 --> 33:55.349
you can feel the suffering.

33:57.886 --> 34:00.786
And how the hell can it be pretty?

34:12.699 --> 34:15.902
I grew up in the church.

34:15.904 --> 34:18.072
My father was a deacon.

34:18.072 --> 34:20.940
He worked two other jobs besides,

34:20.942 --> 34:24.310
to put me and my
sisters through college.

34:25.478 --> 34:28.114
"If I forget thee, O Jerusalem,

34:28.116 --> 34:31.717
let my right hand forget its skill ".

34:33.387 --> 34:36.190
Psalm 137.

34:36.190 --> 34:39.525
Whenever I find myself
near one of these forts,

34:39.527 --> 34:43.297
I make the time to pay
my respect to my daddy,

34:43.297 --> 34:45.732
and to all those who came before me,

34:45.733 --> 34:49.735
who gave so much so that one day,

34:49.737 --> 34:52.139
I could thrive.

34:52.139 --> 34:54.141
That's why I push so hard

34:54.141 --> 34:57.544
to try to make a difference,
both at home and abroad.

34:57.545 --> 35:00.380
It is the least that I could do.

35:00.381 --> 35:02.416
And I do admit,

35:02.417 --> 35:04.485
sometimes, I push a little too hard.

35:04.486 --> 35:07.354
Well, I can be a little pushy myself.

35:07.355 --> 35:09.056
That's why I like you.

35:09.057 --> 35:11.291
Sometimes I get so
wrapped up in the messaging

35:11.292 --> 35:13.227
that I forget about the message.

35:13.228 --> 35:16.196
Well, you may have been right
about the timing of this trip.

35:16.197 --> 35:18.165
Well, something good
might still come out of it,

35:18.166 --> 35:19.666
if the secretary's plan works.

35:19.667 --> 35:20.767
We'll see.

35:20.768 --> 35:22.603
I'm just sorry that the logistics

35:22.604 --> 35:24.238
have been such a nightmare.

35:24.239 --> 35:26.340
Sleeping on those couches,

35:26.341 --> 35:28.675
the plane almost going down.

35:28.676 --> 35:30.878
Don't even get me started on that plane.

35:30.879 --> 35:32.045
Ooh, ooh.

35:32.046 --> 35:33.380
You should have seen your face,

35:33.381 --> 35:35.282
holding the secretary's
hand. You were like,

35:35.283 --> 35:37.451
"I'm gonna die in a plane crash,

35:37.452 --> 35:39.453
and I didn't even want
to go on this damn trip ".

35:44.258 --> 35:46.360
I'm really glad I came.

35:46.361 --> 35:48.494
Good.

35:50.531 --> 35:52.499
Well, I'm gonna pray now.

35:52.500 --> 35:54.501
Would you care to join me?

35:54.502 --> 35:56.870
I'd like that.

36:28.602 --> 36:30.437
Mr. Foreign Minister.

36:30.438 --> 36:32.372
It is an honor to welcome you into Togo.

36:32.373 --> 36:35.375
The honor is mine, Mr. President.

36:35.376 --> 36:37.978
We have a mutually beneficial
opportunity to discuss.

36:37.979 --> 36:39.780
- Yes.
- If you'll excuse me just a moment...

36:39.781 --> 36:40.814
Of course.

36:40.815 --> 36:42.449
Madam Secretary!

36:42.450 --> 36:44.885
Mr. Chen, we've got to
stop meeting like this.

36:44.886 --> 36:46.253
Indeed.

36:46.254 --> 36:48.589
I would think your plane
would've been repaired by now.

36:48.590 --> 36:51.391
Or perhaps, something
else is keeping you here.

36:51.392 --> 36:53.994
I-I'm not gonna comment
on that, either way.

36:53.995 --> 36:54.995
Enjoy Togo.

36:54.996 --> 36:56.063
Whatever you're offering

36:56.064 --> 36:58.031
in exchange for the mineral rights,

36:58.032 --> 37:00.100
we can pay more or build faster.

37:00.101 --> 37:03.370
Never underestimate
American ingenuity, Ming.

37:03.371 --> 37:05.906
Never underestimate
Chinese will, Elizabeth.

37:05.907 --> 37:09.009
Safe travels.

37:09.010 --> 37:11.278
Was I convincing?

37:11.279 --> 37:12.778
- Very.
- Good.

37:21.448 --> 37:23.111
Thank you.
- - Hello, hello.

37:23.112 --> 37:25.185
- Hello. - Hello.
- Hi.

37:25.186 --> 37:26.553
- Welcome.
- Thanks.

37:26.554 --> 37:28.388
Captain.

37:28.389 --> 37:29.923
So are we good to go?

37:29.924 --> 37:31.858
Let's do it, ma'am.

37:31.859 --> 37:34.161
I've never seen DoD
send a replacement part

37:34.162 --> 37:36.530
to such a remote location so quickly.

37:36.531 --> 37:37.831
It came on its own cargo plane.

37:37.832 --> 37:40.167
That's my chief of staff for you.

37:40.168 --> 37:43.670
So, just to be clear, we're
not actually trying to invest

37:43.671 --> 37:45.205
in Togo's phosphate industry.

37:45.206 --> 37:49.876
No. We just want to make
China think we are, so they do.

37:49.877 --> 37:51.311
But President Fabre's price

37:51.312 --> 37:53.547
for letting them beat us out

37:53.548 --> 37:54.715
is to force China

37:54.716 --> 37:56.550
to agree to benchmarks
for sustainability

37:56.551 --> 38:00.187
as well as female
education and employment.

38:00.188 --> 38:02.022
Which could tie them
to similar benchmarks

38:02.023 --> 38:03.423
in the future.

38:03.424 --> 38:06.259
It's a big win. Not just for
us, but for Africa as well.

38:06.260 --> 38:07.661
So we got China

38:07.662 --> 38:09.129
to spend the money we don't have

38:09.130 --> 38:11.465
in the way we wanted. Even
if it looks like we got...

38:11.466 --> 38:13.300
- Pantsed.
- Again.

38:13.301 --> 38:15.202
Which the press is gonna
grill you about, again.

38:15.203 --> 38:17.104
- Yep.
- Sorry about that, Daisy.

38:17.105 --> 38:19.706
Not a problem, ma'am.

38:19.707 --> 38:24.111
We should know if the plan
worked by the time we land.

38:24.112 --> 38:26.346
Of course, even if
we succeed, it'll look

38:26.347 --> 38:29.015
like we failed, so next time we go out,

38:29.016 --> 38:32.152
Congress might give us even less money.

38:32.153 --> 38:34.020
But let's worry about that tomorrow.

38:34.021 --> 38:36.356
Who's ready to go home?

38:37.625 --> 38:39.092
God bless Nadine.

38:44.198 --> 38:45.632
Hey, folks.

38:45.633 --> 38:47.367
We seem to be experiencing some,

38:47.368 --> 38:49.603
unforeseen electrical difficulties.

38:49.604 --> 38:50.737
Still vectoring the issue.

38:50.738 --> 38:52.005
It could be a while.

38:56.476 --> 38:59.044
It's gonna be okay.

39:01.615 --> 39:02.783
Hey, look at that.

39:02.784 --> 39:04.551
We have liftoff!

39:04.552 --> 39:05.468
Woo-hoo!

39:05.469 --> 39:08.121
I've never been this hyped
for a pot of boiling water.

39:08.122 --> 39:09.956
- You should be happy.
- It's weird.

39:09.957 --> 39:12.292
Thanks to China's investment in Togo,

39:12.293 --> 39:14.995
these girls are gonna get
scholarships to go to university

39:14.996 --> 39:17.030
and study the sciences.

39:17.031 --> 39:18.952
They deserve it. I mean,
I barely know how to use

39:18.953 --> 39:20.087
an oven, let alone make one.

39:20.088 --> 39:21.401
- Yeah. I know.
- Okay, okay.

39:21.402 --> 39:22.625
Let me get a picture for them.

39:22.626 --> 39:23.804
- Okay. Yeah.
- Yes.

39:23.805 --> 39:25.005
Ready? Everybody say,

39:25.006 --> 39:27.073
"Science, Technology,
Engineering and Math!"

39:27.074 --> 39:29.342
Science, Technology,
Engineering and Math!

39:29.343 --> 39:33.113
But I just got to say, arts are
of equal value. I'm just saying.

39:33.114 --> 39:34.548
Or... just say "Cheese."

39:34.549 --> 39:36.116
Cheese!

39:36.117 --> 39:37.184
Thanks for breakfast, Mom.

39:37.185 --> 39:38.185
You bet.

39:38.186 --> 39:39.729
And tell the STEM girls they rock.

39:39.730 --> 39:41.688
They will be tweeted at accordingly.

39:41.689 --> 39:42.856
Bye, Mom.

39:42.857 --> 39:45.457
Wow.

39:47.060 --> 39:49.029
Thanks for looking at
us, and not your phones.

39:49.030 --> 39:51.431
Thanks for being interesting.

39:51.432 --> 39:53.934
Another argument in
favor of solar cooking.

39:53.935 --> 39:56.168
Work hard in school today!

39:58.038 --> 39:59.306
Totally useless statement.

39:59.307 --> 40:02.142
Yes, but delivered
with total commitment.

40:02.143 --> 40:04.610
Parenthood in a nutshell.

40:07.047 --> 40:08.582
So, I've been convincing myself

40:08.583 --> 40:11.218
that we actually accomplished
something on the trip.

40:11.219 --> 40:12.552
Are you kidding me?

40:12.553 --> 40:15.388
Getting China to commit
to sustainable investment

40:15.389 --> 40:18.225
and development goals for
the first time? It's huge.

40:18.226 --> 40:19.959
Is it?

40:21.761 --> 40:24.931
Chen said, "Idealism kills."

40:24.932 --> 40:28.068
Mutual interests save lives."

40:28.069 --> 40:29.836
Do you think he's right?

40:29.837 --> 40:32.639
Well, for starters,
"mutual interest"

40:32.640 --> 40:35.208
aren't always the same as equal ones.

40:35.209 --> 40:37.511
So, his own statement is an ideal,

40:37.512 --> 40:39.812
used to justify his self-interest.

40:40.580 --> 40:42.682
Man!

40:42.683 --> 40:44.885
I wish I would've said that.

40:45.987 --> 40:47.654
But maybe he's right.

40:47.655 --> 40:49.456
Sorry.

40:49.457 --> 40:51.691
It's just...

40:51.692 --> 40:54.694
Yesterday, I was face-to-face
with a guy who was convinced

40:54.695 --> 40:56.096
that he was fulfilling God's will

40:56.097 --> 40:57.464
by giving bombs to terrorists.

40:58.866 --> 41:01.434
It can be scary,

41:01.435 --> 41:03.670
seeing fanaticism up close like that.

41:03.671 --> 41:05.405
And humbling, too.

41:05.406 --> 41:07.607
All my fancy talk won't be worth much

41:07.608 --> 41:10.209
if they can't stop him in time.

41:13.847 --> 41:15.915
So, you're sure you haven't
heard from Mr. Mayfield

41:15.916 --> 41:18.485
or any of the other former
members of the Covenant of John?

41:18.486 --> 41:21.087
Like I said, I'm not
into that stuff no more.

41:21.088 --> 41:24.424
And what about your cousin,
Ted? Is he still in the militia?

41:24.425 --> 41:26.126
You know, I don't
really keep up with Ted.

41:26.127 --> 41:27.928
I just go to work,

41:27.929 --> 41:29.729
come home.

41:29.730 --> 41:32.531
Sometimes see my mother.

41:33.300 --> 41:35.835
Well, thank you, Mr. Hobson.

41:35.836 --> 41:38.338
If anything comes up,

41:38.339 --> 41:39.506
give us a call.

41:39.507 --> 41:41.306
Will do.

41:43.109 --> 41:45.744
Y'all take care now.

42:10.437 --> 42:13.006
Ted, it's me.

42:13.007 --> 42:14.541
They were here.

42:14.542 --> 42:16.875
The time is nigh.

42:49.884 --> 42:57.484
