11:50.289 --> 11:52.823
He informed me that you
intend to purchase

11:52.825 --> 11:54.324
all the acreage
in five points.

11:54.326 --> 11:58.429
Winfred had a wild
imagination.

11:58.431 --> 11:59.930
To purchase land
for the sole purpose

11:59.932 --> 12:01.498
of increasing
one's wealth...

12:01.500 --> 12:03.767
I already have wealth,
Right Reverend.

12:03.769 --> 12:05.669
Yet, it appears
you crave more.

12:05.671 --> 12:08.005
Now, I am willing
to keep this matter

12:08.007 --> 12:10.140
between us,
<i>if</i> your desire

12:10.142 --> 12:12.810
to level
five points dims.

12:12.812 --> 12:15.179
If not, I must
obey God's will

12:15.181 --> 12:17.681
and speak out.

12:17.683 --> 12:19.383
Onderdonk, you old goat,
I'm forced, each year,

12:19.385 --> 12:21.118
to pay a tithe
to this Diocese.

12:21.120 --> 12:23.554
If I dare refuse,
you would condemn me

12:23.556 --> 12:25.856
before the entire
congregation.

12:25.858 --> 12:28.125
You call it
a "donation."

12:28.127 --> 12:30.227
I call it
extortion.

12:30.229 --> 12:33.097
Please excuse my son,
Right Reverend.

12:33.099 --> 12:35.833
The eager vision
of youth is,

12:35.835 --> 12:37.401
at times, blind.

12:37.403 --> 12:40.137
Ah, your words
are genuine

12:40.139 --> 12:41.371
and appreciated.

12:41.373 --> 12:43.240
We shall alter the
situation posthaste.

12:43.242 --> 12:45.175
Have a blessed day,

12:45.177 --> 12:47.344
gentlemen.

12:50.615 --> 12:52.116
Are you really
willing to forgo...?

12:52.118 --> 12:54.318
I said "alter
the situation".

12:54.320 --> 12:56.320
Our plan is not
the problem.

12:56.322 --> 12:58.222
Bishop
Onderdonk is.

13:01.468 --> 13:05.771
An unexpected
proposal.

13:05.773 --> 13:07.440
Pardon me.

13:07.442 --> 13:09.075
Come on,
upstairs, miss.

13:09.077 --> 13:12.044
I'll only be
a moment.

13:12.046 --> 13:14.814
Who <i>is</i> that?

13:17.184 --> 13:18.751
Corcoran: Grindle
doesn't look much like

13:18.753 --> 13:21.521
her sister Mary.

13:47.948 --> 13:50.249
Ashes,
or evidence?

13:50.251 --> 13:52.618
What are you going to
do with burnt paper?

13:52.620 --> 13:54.453
Me?

13:54.455 --> 13:55.955
I'm not going to
do anything.

13:55.957 --> 13:58.491
I need something
to put this in.

13:58.493 --> 13:59.759
Here.

14:08.435 --> 14:10.703
Annie.

14:10.705 --> 14:12.238
Annie, whatcha
doing all alone?

14:12.240 --> 14:13.773
I had to talk
to you.

14:13.775 --> 14:15.408
Mrs. Haverford
is evil.

14:15.410 --> 14:16.943
There's a man...
scary...

14:16.945 --> 14:19.011
so there I was,

14:19.013 --> 14:21.647
on Baxter Street,
and ran into Annie.

14:21.649 --> 14:23.149
She was talking
crazy notions,

14:23.151 --> 14:26.252
going on about a strange
man in your house?

14:26.254 --> 14:28.521
[ Chuckle ]

14:28.523 --> 14:31.991
That "strange man" is
Antoin de Bovier.

14:31.993 --> 14:35.027
He's designing
Winfred's mausoleum.

14:35.029 --> 14:37.129
Huh.

14:37.131 --> 14:38.631
Antoine <i>is</i>
<i>a little ghoulish.</i>

14:38.633 --> 14:40.566
[ Chuckle ]

14:40.568 --> 14:42.335
The thing that concerns
me, though, is

14:42.337 --> 14:46.572
the thought of Annie
alone in five points,

14:46.574 --> 14:48.341
the very environment

14:48.343 --> 14:51.277
from which we're
trying to remove her.

14:51.279 --> 14:52.778
Please,
would you sit down?

14:52.780 --> 14:54.180
No, thank you.

14:54.182 --> 14:55.214
Tea?

14:55.216 --> 14:59.385
I have to ask...
given her tempers,

14:59.387 --> 15:01.520
do you still
believe this is

15:01.522 --> 15:03.122
the best place
for the child?

15:03.124 --> 15:05.458
While Annie certainly
has a mind for mischief,

15:05.460 --> 15:07.827
there's an abundance
of potential in her.

15:07.829 --> 15:10.630
And, after you've known me
a while, you'll see...

15:10.632 --> 15:12.231
once I decide to act,
nothing can sway me.

15:12.233 --> 15:16.435
[ Chuckle ]

15:16.437 --> 15:17.803
Evening.

15:21.208 --> 15:22.675
It's pretty.

15:22.677 --> 15:24.343
Mmm.

15:27.714 --> 15:32.385
That would be
a very bad move.

15:32.387 --> 15:34.820
I don't really know
how to play the game.

15:34.822 --> 15:37.590
Well,
I'll teach you.

15:41.428 --> 15:43.763
Marcus:
Yes, indeed!

15:43.765 --> 15:47.600
Ha! Cuba.

15:47.602 --> 15:50.002
Undefeated.

15:50.004 --> 15:51.504
Money by
the bucketloads

15:51.506 --> 15:54.707
and the finest lady
you ever saw...

15:54.709 --> 15:58.944
Daniela López Famosa.
Mmm!

15:58.946 --> 16:00.746
Big, sumptuous eyes.

16:00.748 --> 16:03.449
Your wife, Sara,

16:03.451 --> 16:04.850
she has them same eyes.

16:04.852 --> 16:06.852
You just get lost
in them.

16:06.854 --> 16:08.421
Where's this
Daniela now?

16:08.423 --> 16:10.523
Spent every dime.

16:10.525 --> 16:12.024
Woke up one morning,

16:12.026 --> 16:13.526
other side of the bed
was cold.

16:13.528 --> 16:14.960
Found in a fireplace,
you say?

16:14.962 --> 16:18.798
Yeah.
Any chance?

16:34.281 --> 16:35.881
Let it dry,

16:35.883 --> 16:37.149
or it'll smear.

16:37.151 --> 16:38.884
Goddamn!

16:38.886 --> 16:40.920
Mad scientist,
you are.

16:40.922 --> 16:42.655
These fancy,
new steel pens

16:42.657 --> 16:44.156
use iron
in their ink.

16:44.158 --> 16:46.325
Even fire can't dispose
of iron traces.

16:46.327 --> 16:47.827
The residue is what
you see there.

16:47.829 --> 16:50.763
It seems madame Grindle
might've been

16:50.765 --> 16:52.665
closer to God
than we thought.

16:52.667 --> 16:56.168
5 bucks.

17:11.952 --> 17:14.319
The New York
Episcopal Diocese

17:14.321 --> 17:16.821
sent this letter
to Grindle.

17:16.824 --> 17:18.758
Detective,
you have a remarkable,

17:18.760 --> 17:20.960
irritating tendency
to always take things

17:20.962 --> 17:24.864
one step further
than needed.

17:24.866 --> 17:27.233
"Utmost discretion
of this matter,

17:27.234 --> 17:29.235
or you will be
the one who pays."

17:29.237 --> 17:31.370
Signed the
Right Reverend,

17:31.372 --> 17:33.706
the bishop of
the episcopal church.

17:33.708 --> 17:35.741
A letter burned
in the fireplace

17:35.743 --> 17:38.043
of the murdered
woman's home.

17:38.045 --> 17:41.981
Case is closed.

17:41.983 --> 17:43.849
Closed?

17:43.851 --> 17:45.885
Grindle was
an abortion doctor.

17:45.887 --> 17:47.386
No one cares.

17:47.388 --> 17:48.888
Oh, I think the person
who killed her

17:48.890 --> 17:50.689
cares very much... he
doesn't want to be found.

17:50.691 --> 17:52.191
Nor will he be.

18:00.834 --> 18:02.601
Your name is
Sullivan, right?

18:02.603 --> 18:04.770
It used to be
"O'Sullivan,"

18:04.772 --> 18:06.438
until your da
stepped off the boat

18:06.440 --> 18:10.109
and <i>they</i> made him
scratch off the o.

18:10.111 --> 18:13.012
Grindle was murdered
to protect

18:13.014 --> 18:14.480
some goddamn uptown

18:14.482 --> 18:16.382
Anglo-Saxon Protestant
son of a bitch.

18:16.384 --> 18:17.883
Our lowly
Irish asses

18:17.885 --> 18:19.385
would hang
for lesser crime.

18:19.387 --> 18:22.054
But you, you sit there,
letting them win,

18:22.056 --> 18:23.556
because you want
the hoi polloi to think.

18:23.558 --> 18:26.058
Ciaran Joseph Sullivan
is a good boy!

18:26.060 --> 18:28.294
You finished,
copper?

18:30.730 --> 18:31.897
Good.

18:31.899 --> 18:34.934
Go home, get drunk,
screw your whore.

18:34.936 --> 18:36.836
Tomorrow,
you move on!

18:36.838 --> 18:38.604
Moving on?

18:38.606 --> 18:40.105
Not really
my speciality.

18:45.095 --> 18:46.595
Hood's army
is tearing up

18:46.597 --> 18:48.097
the railroad tracks from
Atlanta to Chattanooga.

18:48.099 --> 18:50.032
Cutting off
union supply lines.

18:50.034 --> 18:53.269
Buy gold at $150.

18:53.271 --> 18:55.071
I'm sorry.
You were saying?

18:55.073 --> 18:57.640
Your family,
you have strong ties

18:57.642 --> 18:59.675
to the Episcopal
Diocese, the clergy.

18:59.677 --> 19:01.610
You own a pew
on the front row

19:01.612 --> 19:03.512
of trinity church.

19:03.514 --> 19:05.014
Yes, yes, but you
know me, Kevin.

19:05.016 --> 19:06.515
I prefer the company

19:06.517 --> 19:08.551
of heathens,
such as yourself;

19:08.553 --> 19:11.854
And less-virginal
women.

19:13.510 --> 19:15.992
The Diocese sent
letters, money,

19:15.994 --> 19:18.894
to Grindle;
She's found murdered;

19:18.896 --> 19:21.030
And her ledger,
detailing all clients

19:21.032 --> 19:23.799
and transactions,
just disappears.

19:23.801 --> 19:25.935
You have yet
to ask a question,

19:25.937 --> 19:28.871
but it seems you
already have an answer.

19:28.873 --> 19:30.973
Major, someone
from the Diocese is...

19:30.975 --> 19:33.542
they're trying
to hide something.

19:33.544 --> 19:36.178
And you think this

19:36.180 --> 19:38.681
ledger possesses
the ultimate truth,

19:38.683 --> 19:41.050
like the holy Bible?

19:41.052 --> 19:43.152
I need to know
who took the ledger.

19:43.154 --> 19:45.955
Who holds
the highest power

19:45.957 --> 19:46.989
among
the Episcopals?

19:46.991 --> 19:49.725
Please.

19:49.727 --> 19:51.293
Quite simple: There's
the Assistant Bishop;

19:51.295 --> 19:52.862
The Bishop Suffragan;

19:52.864 --> 19:54.964
And, at the top,
the Diocesan Bishop.

19:54.966 --> 19:56.665
There.

19:56.667 --> 20:00.870
May I inquire
as to your interest?

20:00.872 --> 20:03.506
It's the madame Grindle
case, sir.

20:03.508 --> 20:05.374
And you believe
some good soul

20:05.376 --> 20:07.743
at the <i>Diocese</i>
is involved?

20:07.745 --> 20:09.645
Leave us.

20:20.690 --> 20:22.758
Detective,

20:22.760 --> 20:26.328
our Diocesan Bishop,
Benjamin Onderdonk,

20:26.330 --> 20:28.330
is held in high esteem,
but there have been

20:28.332 --> 20:30.299
rumors about
his behavior.

20:30.301 --> 20:32.068
There's nothing
more despicable

20:32.070 --> 20:34.070
than a hypocrite.

20:34.072 --> 20:35.571
Begin your search
with him and,

20:35.573 --> 20:37.940
if he is corrupt,
expose him.

20:37.942 --> 20:40.309
What did admiral
Farragut say

20:40.311 --> 20:41.744
at Mobile bay
last August?

20:41.746 --> 20:43.245
"Damn the torpedoes.
Full speed ahead!"

20:43.247 --> 20:44.780
Full speed
ahead.

20:44.782 --> 20:47.950
Yes!

20:47.952 --> 20:50.119
Thomas Cole.

20:50.121 --> 20:51.954
True Americana.

20:54.491 --> 20:56.826
Be careful, Corky.

20:56.828 --> 20:59.095
There are walls
even a man

20:59.097 --> 21:01.197
as dexterous as you
can't climb.

21:01.199 --> 21:04.100
I don't intend to go
over the wall, major.

21:04.102 --> 21:06.469
Like all Irish,

21:06.471 --> 21:08.571
I'll go through
the back door.

21:12.742 --> 21:17.113
A question:

21:17.115 --> 21:18.948
In that ledger,

21:18.950 --> 21:21.083
for whose name
are you truly looking?

21:28.291 --> 21:32.361
Bishop Benjamin
Onderdonk.

21:32.363 --> 21:34.830
How long have you
cooked for him here

21:34.832 --> 21:39.068
at the chancery?

21:39.070 --> 21:41.637
So what can you
tell me about him?

21:41.639 --> 21:43.139
Little to nothing.

21:43.141 --> 21:44.874
He don't come
round my kitchen.

21:44.876 --> 21:46.375
But, still,
a house like this

21:46.377 --> 21:48.144
shakes from the top
down and mischief?

21:48.146 --> 21:51.914
It's whispered
on every floor.

21:51.916 --> 21:53.916
Can't help you.

21:58.822 --> 22:06.395
Uh, it's
Niamh, right?

22:06.397 --> 22:08.097
Is that
a Dublin accent?

22:08.099 --> 22:11.867
'Tis, indeed.

22:11.869 --> 22:13.369
You were born
and raised

22:13.371 --> 22:15.104
on the north side,
were you not?

22:15.106 --> 22:18.941
Some keen ears
on you.

22:18.943 --> 22:20.543
Parnell Square.

22:20.545 --> 22:22.545
I know it well.

22:22.547 --> 22:24.680
Me granddad lived
on Lower Gardiner.

22:24.682 --> 22:27.116
Did he, now?

22:27.118 --> 22:29.385
His entire life.

22:29.387 --> 22:31.153
Did you make
the crossing

22:31.155 --> 22:33.322
on the
McCorkell line?

22:33.324 --> 22:35.824
Six years back.

22:35.826 --> 22:37.159
And look
at you now,

22:37.161 --> 22:39.795
proper
Catholic girl,

22:39.797 --> 22:41.964
toiling away
for Protestants.

22:41.966 --> 22:43.666
What would
your ma say?

22:43.668 --> 22:45.434
[Crying]
Me ma?

22:45.436 --> 22:46.635
Lord!

22:46.637 --> 22:48.737
I could never tell
her things I've seen

22:48.739 --> 22:52.274
since coming to this
<i>saltbox</i> of a country.

22:52.276 --> 22:55.010
But you could
tell <i>me.</i>

22:55.012 --> 22:56.946
What've you seen,
darlin'?

22:59.149 --> 23:04.053
I'm a good woman,
detective, but,

23:04.055 --> 23:05.621
they took me
to St. Peter's

23:05.623 --> 23:07.556
down on Barclay

23:07.558 --> 23:10.226
and I made a vow
on the holy cross

23:10.228 --> 23:13.195
to stay silent.

23:13.197 --> 23:15.331
My eternal soul
is at risk.

23:15.333 --> 23:17.600
I admire
your faith.

23:17.602 --> 23:21.003
But our God, our God,
the Catholic God,

23:21.005 --> 23:23.973
