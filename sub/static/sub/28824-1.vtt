02:29.540 --> 02:33.805
- Ladies and gentlemen,
the tropical Isabella!

02:33.979 --> 02:38.941
Isn't she spectacular!

02:47.732 --> 02:50.909
- Cool, huh?
- Where's the elephant?

02:53.477 --> 02:54.739
- She's retired.

02:54.913 --> 02:57.177
But you get to see
the silly clowns!

02:59.788 --> 03:02.660
- The clowns should
retire, not the elephant.

03:03.879 --> 03:06.403
- And next, coming to the stage!

03:06.577 --> 03:11.408
Bring on the clowns!

03:34.953 --> 03:36.085
- Hey, Albert.

03:59.413 --> 04:00.240
Hey!

04:01.371 --> 04:02.242
- Oh, hey!

04:02.416 --> 04:03.504
Hey, Dawn!

04:03.678 --> 04:04.548
Dawn, come over here!
- Hey!

04:06.550 --> 04:09.597
- You missed some of the
greatest silk drops ever.

04:09.771 --> 04:12.121
- That's why they call her
The Incredible Isabella.

04:14.166 --> 04:17.168
- It's not the same without
Flora, it's just not.

04:17.344 --> 04:18.692
- No, man, we miss
her, we miss her.

04:19.781 --> 04:20.869
- She misses you, too.

04:23.001 --> 04:24.742
But she's gonna
love her new home.

04:24.916 --> 04:29.834
2,900 acres of grazing, barns
and water pools everywhere.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.577
- Hope I get a place that
swanky when I retire.

04:33.751 --> 04:36.188
- "Retire."

04:36.363 --> 04:37.755
- She'll be lonely at first.

04:40.802 --> 04:42.412
But she'll make new friends.

04:42.586 --> 04:45.328
Flora's a very sociable
elephant.

04:45.502 --> 04:46.286
- Yeah, for sure.

04:48.026 --> 04:48.853
Sure.

04:52.988 --> 04:53.728
- Hey, everyone.

04:55.860 --> 04:56.861
So, uh...

04:58.341 --> 04:59.951
We're a little short this week.

05:01.301 --> 05:02.171
Yeah.

05:03.694 --> 05:07.045
The storm wiped out the main
road and people stayed home.

05:07.219 --> 05:09.004
They missed an
incredible performance.

05:10.135 --> 05:12.790
- Yeah, it was
great, but how short?

05:12.964 --> 05:16.098
- I expect word to spread and
a full house tomorrow night.

05:16.272 --> 05:18.318
You'll all get the rest
of your money, okay?

05:24.324 --> 05:25.194
- Thanks, Boss.

05:29.590 --> 05:30.721
- Three weeks in a row.

05:31.679 --> 05:33.333
Look at this.

05:33.507 --> 05:36.684
- Something's
better than nothing, right?

05:36.858 --> 05:39.426
- Yeah, but it's
like three weeks of this.

05:39.600 --> 05:40.557
- He says
it's gonna get better.

05:40.731 --> 05:42.167
It'll get better.

05:46.781 --> 05:47.651
- You
know I have followers

05:47.825 --> 05:49.218
all over the world, right?

05:49.392 --> 05:51.829
- It's good for
stars to have big egos.

06:00.664 --> 06:02.013
- And this is not even half.

06:14.417 --> 06:17.681
- Every time you eat an apple,
who you gonna think of?

06:19.161 --> 06:20.554
That's right, me.

06:22.947 --> 06:26.560
And every time someone steals
an apple when I'm not looking,

06:28.431 --> 06:30.346
I'm gonna think of you.

06:33.218 --> 06:35.090
Here.

06:35.264 --> 06:36.091
Got it?

06:42.750 --> 06:44.099
- Sure, just come on in.

06:44.273 --> 06:46.449
- "Folks, I'm a little
late this week."

06:46.623 --> 06:48.451
Of course you are, you
keep putting all that money

06:48.625 --> 06:50.235
in the elephant who hasn't
even performed in a year.

06:50.410 --> 06:51.628
How is that fair?

06:55.763 --> 06:57.982
Elephant orthotics, $70.

06:59.897 --> 07:00.681
- Let's see here.

07:03.292 --> 07:05.599
Acrobatic harness, 380.

07:06.774 --> 07:08.297
- Well, I am the
star of the show,

07:08.471 --> 07:10.212
and I am the one
people come to see.

07:10.386 --> 07:11.126
So...

07:12.344 --> 07:14.303
- You are, now that
Flora's retired.

07:15.173 --> 07:16.348
You're the star.

07:17.524 --> 07:19.308
- I refuse to let you bait me.

07:20.788 --> 07:22.137
- You should be thanking me.

07:23.399 --> 07:24.792
When I don't pay
you, you get mad.

07:24.966 --> 07:26.707
And when you get mad,
you perform better,

07:26.881 --> 07:29.274
and when you perform better,
you get your name in the paper.

07:29.449 --> 07:32.103
Then maybe you'll get some
more Instagram followers.

07:33.061 --> 07:34.976
- You know, they
called me again.

07:35.150 --> 07:37.195
That circus from Ashton.

07:37.369 --> 07:40.329
Maybe next time I won't hang up.

07:49.599 --> 07:50.644
- Hey.

07:50.818 --> 07:52.036
Hey, Gabriella, no.

07:53.342 --> 07:55.431
It's not too late at
all, we just had a show.

07:59.217 --> 08:00.044
Oh.

08:04.135 --> 08:05.093
Oh, I see.

08:10.315 --> 08:12.013
No, I...

08:12.187 --> 08:13.275
I understand.

08:26.767 --> 08:29.857
- Thank you, Annie.

08:30.031 --> 08:32.511
- Hey, don't beat yourself
up about the crowd.

08:32.686 --> 08:34.905
- I promised Dawn I'd
find a home for Flora.

08:35.863 --> 08:37.081
- But you did.

08:37.255 --> 08:38.212
- Yeah, we're gonna
be there soon.

08:38.386 --> 08:39.606
- They lost their funding.

08:42.043 --> 08:43.957
The preserve director
called me and said

08:44.131 --> 08:47.701
now they're only accepting
sponsored elephants.

08:47.875 --> 08:50.225
$200,000.

08:51.792 --> 08:54.098
And I don't even have 50
bucks to pay my clowns.

08:55.404 --> 08:57.101
- Then we can find
another preserve.

08:58.668 --> 09:00.583
- Chilipingo was the only
one in the whole country.

09:00.757 --> 09:02.280
- Well, what about zoos?

09:02.454 --> 09:05.109
- I've called every
zoo in North America.

09:05.283 --> 09:08.243
Nobody wants an old
elephant with arthritis.

09:08.417 --> 09:10.506
- Well, then what?
- What do you think?

09:13.857 --> 09:15.729
What am I supposed to do?

09:15.903 --> 09:18.645
You can't walk an elephant
around the neighborhood.

09:18.819 --> 09:20.908
They don't curl up at
the foot of your bed!

10:08.782 --> 10:10.174
- Yeah, that's good.

10:10.348 --> 10:12.916
- Oh, Milo, you outdid
yourself this time.

10:13.090 --> 10:14.614
- Hey, you know, most
people add the garlic

10:14.788 --> 10:16.833
and thyme too soon, what
you have to do is wait

10:17.007 --> 10:19.270
for the butter to foam
and start to turn brown.

10:21.229 --> 10:22.012
Thank you.

10:25.059 --> 10:26.800
- Hey, Milo.

10:26.974 --> 10:29.237
Your cottage cheese casserole
was perfect last night, but,

10:29.411 --> 10:30.847
this omelet's even better.

10:31.021 --> 10:32.719
- Thank you, Dawn, you
know, it's nice to know

10:32.893 --> 10:35.286
a barbarian palette is
not a Jacobs family trait.

10:36.418 --> 10:37.811
How far is that preserve again?

10:37.985 --> 10:40.422
- 320 miles, we'll
be there in six days.

10:40.596 --> 10:42.642
- Henry, it's your favorite.
- No, thanks.

10:45.383 --> 10:48.343
Dawn, when you're done with
breakfast, can I speak with you?

10:52.216 --> 10:53.043
- Okay.

11:53.408 --> 11:54.409
- Oh hey, sweetheart.

11:57.412 --> 11:58.674
You know, Flora's in pain.

11:59.719 --> 12:00.981
You've seen her walk around.

12:01.155 --> 12:03.244
Her arthritis is
only gonna get worse.

12:06.029 --> 12:07.509
You know, I love her, too.

12:11.165 --> 12:13.950
But she's had a good
life, a long life.

12:14.124 --> 12:15.735
53 years.

12:15.909 --> 12:18.476
It's the kindest thing
we could do for her.

12:18.650 --> 12:19.477
- Whatever, Dad.

12:34.275 --> 12:35.102
- Um...

12:35.972 --> 12:37.887
Well, I think, I, um...

12:40.194 --> 12:41.630
I might have made a mistake.

12:44.024 --> 12:45.286
- I can't right now.

12:47.157 --> 12:48.506
I'm sending her away.

12:48.680 --> 12:49.812
- Away?

12:49.986 --> 12:51.683
What do you mean away?

12:51.858 --> 12:54.556
- She's gonna stay with her
aunt, Cathy, in Santa Rosa.

12:56.166 --> 12:58.386
She doesn't wanna be
here when the vet comes.

13:52.396 --> 13:53.920
I'm gonna miss you.

13:58.881 --> 14:00.361
Everything's gonna be alright.

14:01.449 --> 14:02.189
- I know.

14:03.712 --> 14:05.627
- Do you have your ticket?
- Yeah, it's right here.

14:05.801 --> 14:06.628
- Okay.

14:08.195 --> 14:09.239
- Welcome aboard.

14:09.413 --> 14:10.719
Watch your step.

15:39.373 --> 15:44.073
- Let's hear it for the
hilarious Bob and Barnaby!

15:48.860 --> 15:51.211
And now, coming to the stage.

15:52.299 --> 15:54.257
The Incredible Isabella!

16:00.307 --> 16:01.656
- Hey, beautiful.

17:09.332 --> 17:10.724
Such a good girl.

17:12.683 --> 17:13.467
Let's go.

17:16.686 --> 17:17.471
Come here.

17:20.082 --> 17:21.300
Come on, Flora.

17:37.143 --> 17:37.969
Come on!

17:51.940 --> 17:52.941
- Get ready.

17:54.116 --> 17:56.640
- Let's hear it for
these hilarious clowns!

18:13.004 --> 18:14.267
- Cathy!

18:14.441 --> 18:15.268
I can't...

18:18.140 --> 18:19.968
What do you mean she's
not on the train?

18:22.753 --> 18:25.104
She texted me that she
arrived over an hour ago.

18:27.410 --> 18:28.803
Okay, I'll call you back.

18:33.460 --> 18:34.287
Come on.

18:38.073 --> 18:39.988
Dawn, where are you?

18:40.162 --> 18:41.120
- Henry!

18:41.294 --> 18:42.382
- Cover for me!

19:02.576 --> 19:03.620
- Alright.

19:03.794 --> 19:07.494
We're good, Flora, come on.

19:07.668 --> 19:08.843
Come on, Flora.

19:25.468 --> 19:27.166
- Dawn!

19:27.340 --> 19:28.167
Dawn!

19:31.170 --> 19:31.996
Dawn!

19:54.410 --> 19:56.107
Where are you, honey?

19:56.282 --> 19:57.108
It's dad.

19:58.414 --> 19:59.720
I want you to know that...

20:00.938 --> 20:04.072
We canceled the vet and
Flora can stay with us.

20:05.552 --> 20:07.031
Until we find her a new home.

20:09.599 --> 20:12.646
I just, I really, I
need you to come home.

20:14.561 --> 20:16.998
I'm, I'm so sorry.

20:17.172 --> 20:18.913
Please, I love you.

20:19.087 --> 20:20.436
Okay, call me back.

20:25.615 --> 20:27.269
- Flora the elephant
has just performed

20:27.443 --> 20:29.228
her most amazing stunt.

20:29.402 --> 20:31.621
Saturday night, Flora
snuck out of her tent,

20:31.795 --> 20:34.624
accompanied by
14-year-old Dawn Jacobs.

20:34.798 --> 20:37.018
The elephant was spotted
taking a late-night stroll

20:37.192 --> 20:40.326
down Main Street by a local
resident walking her dog.

20:40.500 --> 20:42.415
Flora is part of
the Ocotillo Circus,

20:42.589 --> 20:44.547
currently performing in Tapos.

20:44.721 --> 20:47.724
Authorities are confident
they'll find Flora soon because,

20:47.898 --> 20:49.726
well, she's an elephant.

20:49.900 --> 20:53.774
Police are putting out an
APB on this four-ton runaway.

20:53.948 --> 20:57.125
- Has anybody reported
seeing an elephant?

20:57.299 --> 20:59.432
- As a matter of
fact, someone did.

20:59.606 --> 21:01.303
- Well, that's my elephant.

21:01.477 --> 21:03.653
- Why was your elephant wandering
Main Street at 11 o'clock?

21:03.827 --> 21:06.569
- Nobody's up to any good
at that time of night.

21:06.743 --> 21:09.485
- My daughter ran away.

21:10.704 --> 21:12.271
- The elephant
was searching for her?

21:12.445 --> 21:14.142
- No, she ran away
with the elephant.

21:14.316 --> 21:17.188
- Henry's been looking for
both of them all night.

21:17.363 --> 21:18.625
- And they're
not back at the circus?

21:18.799 --> 21:20.627
- No, I wouldn't be
here if they were.

21:20.801 --> 21:22.890
- I'll put a few of
my people right on it.

21:23.064 --> 21:24.457
- Thank you so much, Sheriff.

21:26.633 --> 21:28.983
- If she's run off with a
Chihuahua, it'd take a day or two.

21:29.157 --> 21:31.290
But she ran off with
an elephant, so,

21:31.464 --> 21:32.987
expect a call within an hour.

21:33.161 --> 21:34.162
- Thank you.

21:38.993 --> 21:39.820
Mm-mm.

22:05.889 --> 22:06.673
- Hey.

22:10.329 --> 22:11.155
Hey.

22:15.246 --> 22:17.031
I know how much you
like your sleep, but,

22:18.424 --> 22:19.816
gotta keep going, okay?

22:31.524 --> 22:34.265
Did Dad really think I'd go
to Santa Rosa and leave you?

22:42.578 --> 22:44.363
Hey.

22:44.537 --> 22:46.016
Come on, let's go.

24:13.190 --> 24:15.584
- Flora the circus
elephant and her 14-year-old

24:15.758 --> 24:18.718
companion, Dawn, still
have not been located.

24:18.892 --> 24:21.808
If you happen to see Flora
bathing in your pool,

24:21.982 --> 24:23.418
there's a $1,000 reward.

24:23.592 --> 24:25.289
- Are we staying here?

24:25.464 --> 24:26.508
- Relax.

24:27.422 --> 24:28.989
Why should we be nervous?

24:29.163 --> 24:32.122
If you did your job
well, nobody saw you.

24:33.733 --> 24:34.647
Did you do it well?

24:35.648 --> 24:36.475
Show me.

24:38.302 --> 24:39.739
Not here!

24:39.913 --> 24:42.829
Go around, not here,
what's wrong with you?

24:54.318 --> 24:55.798
What's that?

24:55.972 --> 24:58.192
You made me wait 20
minutes for this?

24:58.366 --> 24:59.759
What's wrong with you?

24:59.933 --> 25:01.238
Go get me a cellphone
or something better!

25:01.412 --> 25:03.153
Get me a cellphone!

25:03.327 --> 25:04.154
Go!

25:20.954 --> 25:23.913
- Hey, guys, gather
round, one last thing.

25:24.087 --> 25:25.219
- What's goin' on, Boss?

25:28.048 --> 25:28.875
- Okay.

25:30.920 --> 25:34.141
I don't expect this to take
more than a day or two, but,

25:35.925 --> 25:37.231
if we can't stay on schedule,

25:37.405 --> 25:39.276
then we have to
cancel the next stop.

25:39.450 --> 25:41.670
Don't worry, 'cause you're
all still getting paid.

25:41.844 --> 25:42.976
- It's not about the money.
- It's cool.

25:43.150 --> 25:44.412
Don't worry about it.

25:44.586 --> 25:45.892
- Yeah, you're
good, man, go find Dawn.

25:46.066 --> 25:48.068
- Family first, man.

25:48.242 --> 25:51.071
- Thank you, guys, I really
appreciate your support.

25:51.245 --> 25:54.161
I'll call Isabella with updates.

25:58.426 --> 26:00.559
Thanks, guys.
- No problem, man.

26:03.257 --> 26:04.606
- I'm going with him.

26:04.780 --> 26:07.348
I'll call you guys
with updates, okay?

26:17.053 --> 26:18.751
- I don't need your help.

26:25.671 --> 26:27.281
This is not open for discussion.

26:27.455 --> 26:29.196
- You're right, it's not.

26:29.370 --> 26:33.113
Get in.

26:33.287 --> 26:34.244
- Buckle up.

26:56.440 --> 26:58.312
- Keep it coming, girl.

27:01.184 --> 27:02.795
It's kinda hot, huh?

27:05.624 --> 27:06.755
Come on, look.

27:07.756 --> 27:09.105
Here's some water.

27:09.279 --> 27:10.106
Ready?

27:10.280 --> 27:11.107
Alright.

27:13.022 --> 27:13.806
Come here.

27:17.200 --> 27:19.594
There we go.

27:26.514 --> 27:27.733
Is that good for you?

27:27.907 --> 27:30.910
A little bit more.

27:33.564 --> 27:34.565
There we go.

27:35.436 --> 27:36.263
Are you good?

27:37.743 --> 27:38.613
There we go.

27:41.007 --> 27:45.272
Like that?

27:45.446 --> 27:46.708
- Leave me alone!

27:46.882 --> 27:48.144
Get off of me!

27:48.318 --> 27:49.493
- Give it to me!

27:49.668 --> 27:51.931
- Hey, leave him alone!

27:52.105 --> 27:53.497
Hey, leave him alone!

27:53.672 --> 27:55.195
Hey, get off of him!

27:55.369 --> 27:57.545
Come on, Flora.
- Give it to me.

27:57.719 --> 27:59.460
Give it to me.
- Get off of him.

28:12.603 --> 28:14.997
- I'm calling the police.

28:15.171 --> 28:17.217
- Let's go, Flora.

28:17.391 --> 28:18.653
Come on, Flora!

28:22.875 --> 28:24.224
- Come on!

28:24.398 --> 28:25.573
This way takes us
further from the road.

28:33.102 --> 28:33.886
This way.

28:37.324 --> 28:38.194
- What've you got?

28:41.023 --> 28:42.329
What's funny?

28:42.503 --> 28:44.723
- You just sound
like someone I know.

28:44.897 --> 28:45.724
- Let me see.

28:50.293 --> 28:51.599
Cabbage and spinach?

28:51.773 --> 28:53.209
You got cabbage and spinach?

28:53.383 --> 28:55.037
- It's all he had.

28:55.211 --> 28:56.386
- Why didn't you rob a farm
that grows something good,

28:56.560 --> 28:57.605
like strawberries?

29:02.479 --> 29:04.438
- Can we put this in
the elephant's pack?

29:04.612 --> 29:05.744
- Her name is Flora.

29:08.485 --> 29:09.356
Bend down, Flora.

29:13.447 --> 29:14.274
Come on, girl.

29:15.405 --> 29:18.060
There you go.

29:18.234 --> 29:19.192
It's a little rocky.

29:22.108 --> 29:23.457
Okay, in you go.

29:28.897 --> 29:29.724
What's your name?

29:31.291 --> 29:32.118
- Sebastian.

29:33.206 --> 29:33.989
- I'm Dawn.

29:36.383 --> 29:37.166
Well?

29:38.472 --> 29:39.908
- What?

29:40.082 --> 29:41.344
- Aren't you gonna ask me

29:41.518 --> 29:42.650
why I'm traveling
with an elephant?

29:43.825 --> 29:45.871
- You're famous, all over TV.

29:48.917 --> 29:50.353
- Let's go.

29:50.527 --> 29:51.790
Come on, Flora.

29:51.964 --> 29:52.965
Come on!

30:03.714 --> 30:04.846
Come on, girl.

30:10.721 --> 30:12.419
Did the news say
where I was headed?

30:13.724 --> 30:15.074
- Just
that you ran away.

30:15.248 --> 30:16.292
- It's no secret.

30:17.467 --> 30:19.295
There's an elephant
preserve in Chilipingo.

30:20.557 --> 30:21.863
- You know how far that is?

30:23.125 --> 30:24.431
And what about the mountain?

30:24.605 --> 30:25.824
- Saw it on the map.

30:27.086 --> 30:28.957
- You do realize
how big that is?

30:29.131 --> 30:30.437
If she can't do circus tricks,

30:30.611 --> 30:32.395
what makes you think she
can climb a mountain?

30:32.569 --> 30:34.049
- Flora's ancestors
crossed the Alps

30:34.223 --> 30:36.225
with the Roman general Hannibal.

30:36.399 --> 30:37.836
I don't think she's worried
about a rinky dink--

30:38.010 --> 30:38.837
- Right.

30:42.188 --> 30:43.015
Hey!

30:47.193 --> 30:48.020
- Come on, girl.

30:52.372 --> 30:53.590
Thanks for the spinach.

30:53.764 --> 30:55.549
- Thanks for the bread.

30:55.723 --> 30:57.681
- Bye.

30:57.856 --> 30:59.292
- Pleasure to make
your acquaintance.

31:03.122 --> 31:04.166
Let me come with you.

31:05.428 --> 31:07.213
- No chance.
- Part of the way?

31:07.387 --> 31:08.475
- Why?

31:08.649 --> 31:10.259
- My penance.

31:10.433 --> 31:11.739
Stealing is wrong and I
wanna do a good deed like

31:11.913 --> 31:13.436
help a lost girl
and her elephant.

31:13.610 --> 31:15.656
- You lie.
- My penance for lying.

31:15.830 --> 31:16.657
- Goodbye.

31:18.267 --> 31:19.616
- You know why I wanna help?

31:19.790 --> 31:21.749
Flora's scared away that
farmer, I owe you guys.

31:21.923 --> 31:23.011
- We don't need help.

31:26.928 --> 31:29.322
- What if you get
bitten by a scorpion?

31:29.496 --> 31:30.453
- I know what to do.

31:32.281 --> 31:33.979
- Scorpions don't
bite, they sting.

31:36.372 --> 31:39.158
- I knew that.
- No, you didn't, but I do.

31:39.332 --> 31:41.073
I know the mountain that you're
headed to is 11,000 feet,

31:41.247 --> 31:43.205
and there's only
one road through.

31:43.379 --> 31:45.599
I know what berries you
can eat and what you can't.

31:47.253 --> 31:49.124
I know how to hide when
people are searching for me.

31:49.298 --> 31:50.821
- Oh, like the
cops looking for you now?

31:50.996 --> 31:53.955
- Hey, I've only been to
jail once, what about you?

31:54.129 --> 31:55.478
- Are you serious?

31:55.652 --> 31:56.566
Never.

31:56.740 --> 31:57.567
Obviously.

31:58.568 --> 32:00.222
- Not so obvious.

32:00.396 --> 32:02.398
I've never stole
anything as big as Flora.

32:03.617 --> 32:05.749
The biggest thing I've
stolen was a truck.

32:05.924 --> 32:07.229
- I didn't steal Flora.

32:08.404 --> 32:09.840
- The circus let you take her?

32:11.320 --> 32:14.323
- They were going,
why am I even talking to you?

32:14.497 --> 32:16.151
- Don't worry.

32:16.325 --> 32:18.632
Elephant larceny is only a
misdemeanor in this county.

32:18.806 --> 32:20.373
- Oh, you think you're funny?

32:20.547 --> 32:21.722
- Hey, if you're gonna
travel 300 miles with a boy,

32:21.896 --> 32:23.506
wouldn't you want
him to be funny?

32:23.680 --> 32:24.812
- Oh my god, I'm not traveling
300 miles with a boy.

32:24.986 --> 32:27.597
Especially if that boy is you.

32:27.771 --> 32:29.686
I'm saying goodbye right here.

32:30.905 --> 32:31.732
Come on, Flora.

32:34.300 --> 32:35.257
- You're right.

32:36.867 --> 32:39.044
The cops will be after me,
that's why I don't wanna go back.

32:39.218 --> 32:41.568
I thought we could
help each other out.

32:41.742 --> 32:43.222
But you want to go
into the barren,

32:43.396 --> 32:46.486
rattlesnake-infested
desert alone, that's cool.

32:48.314 --> 32:49.445
Bye.

32:53.275 --> 32:55.582
- Hey, Sebastian.

32:55.756 --> 32:57.149
- Yes?

32:57.323 --> 32:58.933
- You can stay with
us for one more hour.

33:00.326 --> 33:01.153
- Let's go.

33:05.809 --> 33:07.202
- He's testing me.

33:16.864 --> 33:18.779
- What if they make
it to the preserve?

33:21.390 --> 33:23.175
- Well, we'll
find them first.

33:23.349 --> 33:25.220
- But I'm just saying, what if
they make it to the preserve?

33:25.394 --> 33:28.006
They'll be turned away, they
still don't have the money.

33:30.356 --> 33:31.879
- But we will find her, right?

33:32.967 --> 33:33.707
- Yes.

33:33.881 --> 33:34.751
Yes, we'll find her.

33:41.541 --> 33:43.325
- Hey, can I see that?

33:44.805 --> 33:45.632
Thank you.

33:50.463 --> 33:51.246
You alright?

33:57.731 --> 33:58.949
After I finish
setting up this fire,

33:59.124 --> 34:00.516
gonna get some rest, alright?

34:01.474 --> 34:02.866
Sound good to you?

34:16.402 --> 34:17.228
I love you.

34:18.839 --> 34:19.795
That's my girl.

34:34.114 --> 34:35.594
- I told you there's only
one road over the mountain.

34:35.768 --> 34:37.031
- It's the fastest way.

34:38.511 --> 34:39.860
- If you go to Sabinas, you
can head north from there,

34:40.034 --> 34:41.382
and go around the mountain.

34:41.556 --> 34:43.472
- That's the way
they expect me to go.

34:43.646 --> 34:44.952
- You should listen to me.

38:02.149 --> 38:05.021
- My uncle says they're
bullet holes in the sky.

38:13.813 --> 38:14.901
There's more than one?

38:16.294 --> 38:17.556
- They travel in packs.

38:24.040 --> 38:25.477
- They're closer than before.

38:29.176 --> 38:30.612
- Are you afraid of coyotes?

38:30.786 --> 38:32.092
- No, of course not.

38:33.528 --> 38:35.400
- They don't harm people.
- Yeah, I know that.

38:38.141 --> 38:40.187
- They're probably just
talking about Flora.

38:43.625 --> 38:45.235
"Hey.

38:45.410 --> 38:47.325
"What's that big gray animal
by the fire over there?"

38:50.806 --> 38:53.679
- "No idea, dude."

38:53.853 --> 38:55.158

- "I'm not checking it
out, you check it out."

38:57.552 --> 39:00.207
- "Let's get outta here and
find ourselves a rabbit."

39:29.758 --> 39:31.586
- I just can't believe
she's out there.

39:33.893 --> 39:36.069
- You know, you really
underestimate her.

39:36.243 --> 39:38.201
She's much more
resilient than you think.

39:38.376 --> 39:39.551
Not to mention Flora.

39:41.030 --> 39:42.728
Who'd wanna mess with Flora?

39:42.902 --> 39:45.078
This is a good picture, what
do you think about this one?

39:45.252 --> 39:46.645
- Awesome.
- It's a good one, right?

39:46.819 --> 39:47.602
Should I post it?

39:48.777 --> 39:50.562
- Yes, absolutely.

39:56.785 --> 39:57.699
- Hello?

39:59.048 --> 39:59.875
Hello?

40:01.355 --> 40:02.182
Hold on.

40:05.403 --> 40:06.273
Hello?

40:08.884 --> 40:10.016
Yeah, I can hear you.

40:11.757 --> 40:12.888
They did?

40:13.062 --> 40:13.933
Where?

40:15.935 --> 40:16.979
We'll be right there.

40:18.807 --> 40:20.548
- What happened?
- She was spotted.

40:21.636 --> 40:23.246
- Great, let's go!
- Yeah.

40:25.205 --> 40:26.902
- It's gonna be okay.

40:28.861 --> 40:31.559
This is good, this is good.

40:31.733 --> 40:33.431
What else did he say?

40:34.867 --> 40:37.696
- They spotted an elephant
with a little girl.

40:37.870 --> 40:38.653
At this farm.

40:39.611 --> 40:41.787
He's gonna send me the address.

40:41.961 --> 40:43.441
- Okay, okay, you
drive, I do this.

40:54.843 --> 40:56.976
- She couldn't have made it
this far in that amount of time.

40:57.150 --> 40:58.804
- Is it possible you
underestimate your daughter?

40:58.978 --> 41:01.807
- Yes, he does.
- I was talking about Flora.

41:01.981 --> 41:03.939
- Mr. Suarez claims that
Dawn and the elephant

41:04.113 --> 41:06.594
ran off with a teenage boy
who stole his cabbages.

41:06.768 --> 41:09.118
- Well, this just gets
better and better!

41:11.338 --> 41:13.296
- Forgive him, what
else can you tell us?

41:13.471 --> 41:15.603
- There's not much more
information right now.

41:15.777 --> 41:17.997
I've got my guys searching
the entire county.

41:18.171 --> 41:19.564
- Who is this kid?

41:19.738 --> 41:20.869
- We don't know who
the boy is right now.

41:32.664 --> 41:34.013
- Flora's on TV!

41:36.189 --> 41:38.278
- Oh my gosh.

41:38.452 --> 41:41.673
- After six days, searchers
still haven't located Flora

41:41.847 --> 41:45.067
the runaway circus elephant
and 14-year-old Dawn Jacobs.

41:45.241 --> 41:48.375
They were spotted earlier outside
the farm of Javier Suarez.

41:48.549 --> 41:52.205
- I caught a boy stealing my
crop, so I went to go stop him,

41:52.379 --> 41:55.295
and then that's when the
elephant came out of nowhere.

41:55.469 --> 41:58.080
It stood up in the air.

41:58.254 --> 42:00.822
If I didn't run from that
elephant it would have crushed me.

42:00.996 --> 42:02.476
- Flora wouldn't hurt a fly.

42:02.650 --> 42:04.783
- Who let that
buffoon on television?

42:04.957 --> 42:06.828
Everyone's gonna
think she's a threat.

42:10.005 --> 42:12.138
- Picture yourself crushing
a big fat dung beetle

42:12.312 --> 42:14.009
with a giant fly swatter.

42:14.183 --> 42:15.881
Yeah, that's how easy this
job's gonna be for me.

42:16.055 --> 42:17.273
I promise you.

42:17.447 --> 42:19.145
Okay, thank you.

42:19.319 --> 42:22.104
Bob, got some bad news, I
know how much pride you take

42:22.278 --> 42:26.805
in decorating the home front
here, but we gotta move Mick.

42:26.979 --> 42:28.720
- We gotta move Mick?
- We gotta move Mick.

42:28.894 --> 42:30.199
Sorry, Mick.

42:30.373 --> 42:32.288
You've been good to us,
you've been faithful,

42:32.462 --> 42:35.596
but we got a new head comin'
in, a bigger and better head.

42:35.770 --> 42:37.946
We got ourselves an elephant.
- Elephant?

42:39.426 --> 42:41.602
- Don't worry, Keith,
you're not goin' anywhere.

42:41.776 --> 42:43.735
There's an elephant
marauding through the desert,

42:43.909 --> 42:45.954
threatening persons
and property.

42:46.912 --> 42:48.522
- So we're hired to kill it?

42:48.696 --> 42:51.438
- Well, he said something
about a tranquilizer dart, but,

42:51.612 --> 42:53.832
then my phone got funky and I
would have swore I heard him

42:54.006 --> 42:56.051
say, "Runyon, I want you
to stalk that elephant.

42:56.225 --> 42:58.663
"I want you to shoot it
dead and then I want you

42:58.837 --> 43:02.318
"to put its head on
the wall of your home."

43:02.492 --> 43:05.278
So, that's what I'm gonna do.

43:07.497 --> 43:09.282
- But won't Kieth get lonely?

43:10.544 --> 43:11.327
- Kieth?

43:12.807 --> 43:15.941
Kieth won't even notice
the difference.

43:17.420 --> 43:18.944
Oh, Kieth.

43:19.118 --> 43:21.424
God bless him.

43:37.397 --> 43:39.617
- How long has
your dad owned a circus?

43:39.791 --> 43:41.836
- Well, he started off
as a candy butcher.

43:42.010 --> 43:44.317
Those are the people who
sell cotton candy and stuff.

43:44.491 --> 43:46.319
Yeah, they called
him the Handsome Henry.

43:46.493 --> 43:47.363
- Handsome Henry.

43:48.582 --> 43:51.716
- He bought the Ocotillo
Circus 16 years ago,

43:51.890 --> 43:54.893
and I was born on the road
in a town called El Capitan.

43:56.634 --> 43:59.332
We had a
show that same night.

43:59.506 --> 44:02.074
The tightrope walker needed
a prop, so he carried me.

44:02.248 --> 44:03.336
- What?

44:03.510 --> 44:05.860
- Geez, I'm kidding!

44:06.034 --> 44:08.080
You take it so seriously.

44:08.254 --> 44:09.821
- So, do you guys
travel all year long?

44:09.995 --> 44:10.952
- Spring till fall.

44:12.519 --> 44:15.130
My dad says the circus is
a city without a zip code.

44:15.304 --> 44:17.655
- A city without a zip code.
- Mm-hm.

44:17.829 --> 44:19.178
- That's where I wanna live.

44:20.179 --> 44:21.528
I should join the circus!

44:21.702 --> 44:23.269
- What's your act?

44:23.443 --> 44:26.141
- Who's the guy that says,
"ladies and gentlemen,

44:26.315 --> 44:29.667
"welcome to the most
amazing show on Earth."

44:29.841 --> 44:31.843
- That's the ringmaster.
- Oh.

44:32.017 --> 44:33.148
- That's my dad's job.

44:34.323 --> 44:36.021
- Well, I could be a clown.

44:36.195 --> 44:37.718
- Remember when I told
you you're not funny?

44:37.892 --> 44:39.851
- Oh, yeah, back when you
said you wouldn't travel

44:40.025 --> 44:41.766
300 miles with a boy like me.

44:41.940 --> 44:44.290
- Hey, you're still on
a trial period, alright?

44:44.464 --> 44:45.247
Settle down.
- Alright.

45:06.225 --> 45:07.530
- Okay.

45:07.705 --> 45:09.271
Right, small.

45:09.445 --> 45:12.579
Just about the size you'd
expect from a 14-year-old girl.

45:13.754 --> 45:15.451
- Bob.
- I think we found 'em, man.

45:15.625 --> 45:17.279
- Bob, those are human
footprints there.

45:17.453 --> 45:18.454
- Huh?

45:18.628 --> 45:19.934
Oh, hey, hey, look over here.

45:20.108 --> 45:22.067
We got another set of
prints a little bigger.

45:22.241 --> 45:23.895
No, no, it's not them.

45:24.069 --> 45:25.635
Unless the girl's
travelin' with a friend.

45:25.810 --> 45:27.507
- Bob, wouldn't it be better
to focus on these big,

45:27.681 --> 45:29.901
round elephant footprints, huh?

45:30.075 --> 45:31.903
- Elephant prints?
- Yeah.

45:32.077 --> 45:34.732
- Yeah, huh, you make
a good point, man.

45:34.906 --> 45:36.298
Can't deny it.

45:36.472 --> 45:37.299
Yeah, Runyon.

45:40.259 --> 45:41.303
Oh, that's a good one.

45:44.132 --> 45:44.872
Yep.

45:46.395 --> 45:47.919
- They are
somewhere in this desert.

45:48.093 --> 45:49.355
My volunteers will find her.

45:49.529 --> 45:51.313
- Well, they're going here.

45:51.487 --> 45:52.967
- Chilipingo.

45:53.141 --> 45:55.622
- Yeah, it's
an elephant preserve.

45:55.796 --> 45:58.016
- You see that mountain,
it's 11,000 feet.

45:59.800 --> 46:01.584
- They'll never
make it over that.

46:01.759 --> 46:03.195
They'll have to go around.

46:03.369 --> 46:05.197
- We're gonna find
Dawn, Mr. Jacobs.

46:05.371 --> 46:06.894
We're gonna find her real soon.

46:07.852 --> 46:08.678
- Thank you.

46:17.470 --> 46:21.430
- That a girl.

46:21.604 --> 46:22.954
How're you doin'?

46:31.136 --> 46:32.224
- Shh, check this out.

46:33.791 --> 46:34.617
Trust me.

46:36.054 --> 46:37.664
Go on, I'll catch up.
- You sure?

46:37.838 --> 46:40.449
- Go.
- Alright, alright.

46:40.623 --> 46:42.669
- Stay quiet.

47:16.224 --> 47:17.486
- You know, when
I have trouble sleepin',

47:17.660 --> 47:19.488
I just count my trophies.

47:19.662 --> 47:23.014
Black rhino, white
rhino, hippopotamus,

47:23.188 --> 47:27.496
zebra, giraffe, grizzly
bear, black bear,

47:27.670 --> 47:31.370
lion, tiger, leopard,
panther, jaguar.

47:34.677 --> 47:36.766
- So, uh, what's
the plan tomorrow?

47:38.072 --> 47:39.682
- It's a simple plan, really.

47:39.857 --> 47:41.249
One, locate the elephant.

47:41.423 --> 47:42.947
Two, kill the elephant.

47:43.121 --> 47:45.645
Three, place the elephant's
head on the wall.

47:47.386 --> 47:48.866
Gonna be a big day.

48:14.282 --> 48:15.805
- Are you sure they were
talking about Flora?

48:15.980 --> 48:19.374
- Positive, I was three
feet away from their tent.

48:19.548 --> 48:21.115
- Why would they wanna kill her?

48:21.289 --> 48:23.465
Why would anyone wanna
kill an elephant? I...

48:24.510 --> 48:26.033
- I don't know.

48:26.207 --> 48:29.080
But they do, and
they have quads.

48:29.254 --> 48:30.908
Look, we can't
sleep here for long.

48:42.876 --> 48:43.790
- I'm cold!

48:49.274 --> 48:50.971
I can't walk anymore.

48:54.453 --> 48:55.323
- Dawn!

48:57.978 --> 48:59.197
We can't stay here!

49:01.068 --> 49:03.288
- You don't have
to stay with us!

49:03.462 --> 49:04.289
Go.

49:05.681 --> 49:07.553
Don't let us slow you down.

49:10.251 --> 49:11.992
- Alright, alright,
we'll take a break.

49:12.166 --> 49:13.472
Hey.

49:16.475 --> 49:18.607
- I can't do this.

49:18.781 --> 49:19.608
- Hey.

49:19.782 --> 49:20.783
Hey, you fooled them!

49:22.307 --> 49:24.004
You snuck Flora
out of the circus!

49:26.180 --> 49:29.662
Dawn, you saved her life,
you're brave, you're smart.

49:31.272 --> 49:34.319
You wanna take her to the
preserve, I know, I know you will.

49:36.625 --> 49:37.452
Come on.

49:41.543 --> 49:44.068
- Fine.

49:50.248 --> 49:51.379
- Alright, let's go.

49:51.553 --> 49:52.990
- Come on, Flora.

50:26.371 --> 50:27.154
Flora!

50:30.984 --> 50:31.811
Flora!

50:35.206 --> 50:36.033
Flora!

50:39.514 --> 50:41.690
- Try some of this?

50:52.266 --> 50:53.485
Oh, hey.

50:53.659 --> 50:54.660
Good morning.
- Morning.

50:57.576 --> 50:58.794
- Want some?

50:58.968 --> 51:00.666
So how'd you sleep?

51:00.840 --> 51:01.667
- Good.

51:03.234 --> 51:04.148
We gotta go.

51:04.322 --> 51:05.105
Let's go, Flora.

51:06.193 --> 51:09.936
Come on.

51:10.110 --> 51:11.242
Come on, girl.

51:13.026 --> 51:14.897
- Come on, Flora.

51:15.072 --> 51:16.290
Let's go, girl.

51:23.123 --> 51:25.256
- I should
have known she'd never

51:25.430 --> 51:27.127
get on that train without Flora.

51:27.301 --> 51:28.607
- She fooled us all.

51:30.087 --> 51:31.566
- She shouldn't have fooled me.

51:32.611 --> 51:34.091
I had a clue.

51:34.265 --> 51:35.396
- What clue?

51:36.658 --> 51:38.834
- I know that Dawn is
just like her mother.

51:39.879 --> 51:41.185
- You never talk about her.

51:42.360 --> 51:43.143
- Sophia.

51:44.101 --> 51:45.493
She was Flora's trainer.

51:46.712 --> 51:48.931
She loved Flora like she
was another daughter.

51:50.890 --> 51:53.371
When she got diagnosed
with breast cancer,

51:53.545 --> 51:55.721
she fought so hard.

51:57.853 --> 52:01.292
She always took care of
Flora, right up to the end.

52:02.293 --> 52:03.816
So, when she died, I...

52:05.383 --> 52:06.123
Dawn took over.

52:07.907 --> 52:09.300
And they've been inseparable.

52:22.530 --> 52:24.053
- Hey, where do
you think you're goin'?

52:24.228 --> 52:25.925
- Find Dawn and Flora.
- We thought you'd say that.

52:27.056 --> 52:27.883
- Get in!

52:44.813 --> 52:46.380
- Hey.
- Huh?

52:46.554 --> 52:50.384
- Where's the guns?

53:01.047 --> 53:02.309
That elephant's gonna pay.

53:46.223 --> 53:47.920
Whoa.

53:48.094 --> 53:49.617
- There it is!

53:49.791 --> 53:51.228
- It's a lot bigger in person.

54:01.586 --> 54:03.240
How deep do you
think the water is?

54:04.371 --> 54:05.198
- Hard to say.

54:14.773 --> 54:15.600
Thanks.

54:22.650 --> 54:24.043
- What if it's too
deep for Flora?

54:24.217 --> 54:25.436
- Oh, she's a great swimmer.

54:31.485 --> 54:33.922
Hey, I'll find a
more narrow crossing.

54:34.096 --> 54:36.795
- No, no, no, we cross here.

54:36.969 --> 54:38.275
- We'll find somewhere else.

54:39.885 --> 54:42.235
It looks much further
than it looked at first.

54:42.409 --> 54:44.063
I can't swim that far.

54:44.237 --> 54:46.326
- You're just saying that so
I don't feel like a loser.

54:46.500 --> 54:47.675
- Come on!
- I can do it.

54:47.849 --> 54:49.547
- We'll find a better place.

54:51.288 --> 54:52.985
- Dawn, the hunters!

54:53.159 --> 54:54.595
- Come on, we gotta
go, we can do this!

54:54.769 --> 54:59.513
Let's go, Flora!

55:08.827 --> 55:11.220
- There's the elephant!
- Huh?

55:17.314 --> 55:18.315
- Come back!

55:32.067 --> 55:33.286
Okay.

55:33.460 --> 55:35.593
Say goodnight, sweetheart.

55:58.659 --> 56:00.052
Okay, here we go.

56:02.228 --> 56:03.664
- Come on!

56:06.841 --> 56:09.366
Almost there!

56:09.540 --> 56:11.193
- I got it!

56:47.012 --> 56:49.057
- Well, don't look at me!

57:07.859 --> 57:10.339
- What do you mean he hasn't
called the hunters off?

57:10.514 --> 57:11.340
- What?

57:12.777 --> 57:14.996
- No, that's not what
happened, he said they fired

57:15.170 --> 57:17.999
two shots at Dawn while
she was in the river!

57:18.173 --> 57:20.567
Call the big game hunters off!

57:20.741 --> 57:21.525
- Okay.

57:22.569 --> 57:24.049
Okay.

57:24.223 --> 57:25.137
Take a deep breath.

57:41.414 --> 57:44.678
- I slept so good, I don't
even remember my dreams.

58:09.268 --> 58:12.053
- I can't believe
I slept so long.

58:13.577 --> 58:15.404
- You were tired.
- Yeah, I guess.

58:17.232 --> 58:19.278
- Probably had a hard
time falling asleep.

58:20.584 --> 58:22.411
Thinking about all
that reward money.

58:27.852 --> 58:29.201
Your friend should be proud.

58:30.811 --> 58:32.552
You totally had me fooled.

58:33.771 --> 58:35.512
Especially with that
speech in the rain.

58:35.686 --> 58:36.774
"You're gonna make it
to that preserve, Dawn.

58:36.948 --> 58:37.992
"I know you are."

58:39.211 --> 58:41.518
- Dawn, please.
- Leave, Sebastian.

58:41.692 --> 58:44.042
- I sent those
texts the first day.

58:44.216 --> 58:45.391
- You wanted
me to go to Sabinas.

58:45.565 --> 58:46.914
- Yeah, I didn't--

58:47.088 --> 58:48.699
- That's where your
friend was waiting.

58:50.265 --> 58:52.703
- I didn't know you
then, but now I...

58:53.878 --> 58:56.010
Please let me
help, I wanna help.

58:56.184 --> 58:56.968
- Stop lying.

58:58.926 --> 59:00.145
- You have to believe me.

59:01.146 --> 59:03.017
Please believe me?

59:03.191 --> 59:04.453
- Leave, Sebastian!

59:05.411 --> 59:06.238
- Dawn.

59:07.544 --> 59:08.849
Dawn--
- Leave now.

59:32.394 --> 59:33.526
Hey.

59:33.700 --> 59:34.527
You ready?

59:36.442 --> 59:37.269
Let's go, Flora.

59:40.315 --> 59:43.536
I trust Dad, he
decides to kill you.

59:43.710 --> 59:46.931
I trust Sebastian, he wants
to collect a $1,000 reward.

59:49.847 --> 59:51.849
Time I learned my lesson, huh?

59:52.023 --> 59:54.591
Stop trusting people.

59:59.596 --> 01:00:00.422
Come on, girl.

01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:03.600
Got a long distance today.

01:00:18.789 --> 01:00:19.920
- Runyon here.

01:00:21.139 --> 01:00:21.922
Yes, sir.

01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:24.490
I understand.

01:00:25.709 --> 01:00:27.885
The elephant's no longer
in Herschel County, so,

01:00:28.059 --> 01:00:29.495
it's out of his jurisdiction.

01:00:30.539 --> 01:00:32.498
- So what, the hunt's over?

01:00:32.672 --> 01:00:34.979
- Unless the elephant comes
back to Herschel County.

01:00:35.153 --> 01:00:36.154
- Yeah, but why would
the girl lead it back

01:00:36.328 --> 01:00:37.982
to where they came?

01:00:38.156 --> 01:00:40.332
- Well, we could promise her
an elephant ear umbrella,

01:00:41.638 --> 01:00:44.815
or...

01:01:05.792 --> 01:01:06.837
- Hey!

01:01:07.011 --> 01:01:08.055
- Hey, Fernando!

01:01:09.361 --> 01:01:11.145
Hey, what's up, man?
- What's wrong with you?

01:01:11.319 --> 01:01:13.104
- Hey, hey, Fernando.
- You don't answer my texts.

01:01:13.278 --> 01:01:14.845
- There was no service.

01:01:17.717 --> 01:01:19.371
- Where is my elephant?

01:01:19.545 --> 01:01:21.765
- They got away, they got
away when I was sleeping!

01:01:22.809 --> 01:01:23.854
- Watch yourself.

01:01:26.291 --> 01:01:27.596
Get my elephant.

01:01:32.036 --> 01:01:33.385
Get my elephant!

01:01:40.784 --> 01:01:42.524
- Hey, hey!

01:01:42.699 --> 01:01:43.569
Quickly!

01:02:02.022 --> 01:02:04.851
- Okay, that's 18.38.

01:02:06.418 --> 01:02:07.245
- Oh, sorry.

01:02:12.772 --> 01:02:13.599
Keep the change.

01:02:18.125 --> 01:02:19.083
- Thank you!

01:02:23.565 --> 01:02:25.263
- Thanks!
- Thank you.

01:02:38.755 --> 01:02:40.321
- Hello?

01:02:40.495 --> 01:02:41.888
Yeah, I saw a poster about
a girl and an elephant.

01:02:42.062 --> 01:02:43.411
Says there's a reward?

01:02:43.585 --> 01:02:45.718
Yeah, yeah, I saw them,
they're in Sabinas.

01:02:46.632 --> 01:02:47.459
Sabinas.

01:02:47.633 --> 01:02:49.287
Did you write that down?

01:02:49.461 --> 01:02:50.767
Okay, I have to hang up now
'cause I have to catch a plane.

01:02:50.941 --> 01:02:51.898
Alright, okay.

01:03:08.306 --> 01:03:11.309
- Hey, we got a sighting
in Sabinas, move out.

01:03:28.456 --> 01:03:29.327
- Right.

01:03:31.633 --> 01:03:33.026
Gonna go in here.

01:03:46.257 --> 01:03:47.998
Okay, come on, Flora.

01:03:49.434 --> 01:03:50.261
Come on.

01:03:51.218 --> 01:03:52.176
That a girl.

01:03:53.917 --> 01:03:56.093
Alright, we're gonna
stop here for the night.

01:05:02.986 --> 01:05:03.812
- Dawn!

01:05:05.292 --> 01:05:08.817
Don't be scared, you
and Flora have to leave.

01:05:08.992 --> 01:05:10.602
- I'm sorry, I fell asleep.

01:05:10.776 --> 01:05:13.605
- I want you to stay, but my
dad saw you and called someone.

01:05:16.738 --> 01:05:17.565
- Thank you.

01:05:25.747 --> 01:05:27.619
- Hey,
it's not deer season.

01:05:27.793 --> 01:05:29.969
- Oh, we're huntin'
bigger game than that.

01:05:30.143 --> 01:05:31.928
- Elephant?
- Have you seen the elephant?

01:05:32.102 --> 01:05:34.321
- Do you have permits
for these rifles, sir?

01:05:34.495 --> 01:05:37.150
- What kind of a game warden
wears a Hawaiian shirt?

01:05:37.324 --> 01:05:38.804
- Have you got a permit
for that idiot, sir?

01:05:38.978 --> 01:05:40.806
- That's funny, but
if you don't mind,

01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:42.982
we're here on official
government business, so--

01:05:43.156 --> 01:05:46.333
- We do mind.

01:05:46.507 --> 01:05:47.769
- Oh boy, oh boy.

01:05:49.641 --> 01:05:50.468
Yeah, yeah.

01:05:56.213 --> 01:05:57.127
- The hunt's over.

01:05:58.563 --> 01:06:00.173
- Why'd you stand there while
they were breakin' my gun,

01:06:00.347 --> 01:06:02.001
flossin' you teeth?
- Sorry, man.

01:06:02.175 --> 01:06:03.524
Dental hygiene's important.

01:06:11.619 --> 01:06:12.707
- A barn, where?

01:06:12.881 --> 01:06:14.361
I thought they were in Sabinas?

01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:56.229
- Oh, an elite
force, you said, huh?

01:06:56.403 --> 01:06:59.058
"They know this area like
the back of their hand!"

01:06:59.232 --> 01:07:01.539
- When we got to
the barn, they were gone.

01:07:01.713 --> 01:07:03.062
But take a look at this.

01:07:03.236 --> 01:07:04.020
- What?

01:07:06.109 --> 01:07:07.240
I'll call you back.

01:07:13.899 --> 01:07:14.943
- Oh my god.

01:07:38.750 --> 01:07:40.708
- Somebody likes apples.

01:07:59.118 --> 01:08:00.946
Good, that elephant
loves apples.

01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:02.513
We've gotta get all the apples.

01:08:02.687 --> 01:08:04.080
- All the apples, got it.
- Alright, Bob.

01:08:04.254 --> 01:08:05.777
- Yep.
- This is our first date.

01:08:05.951 --> 01:08:07.170
You gotta make a good
impression on a first date.

01:08:07.344 --> 01:08:08.693
- That's what I'm told, yeah.

01:08:10.216 --> 01:08:13.567
- It's our last
date, too.

01:08:13.741 --> 01:08:14.916
- Right, right, 'cause
we're gonna kill the elephant.

01:08:15.091 --> 01:08:17.049
- Well, I am.
- Well, yeah, yeah.

01:08:17.223 --> 01:08:19.356
Hey, can I have one?
- Yeah.

01:08:19.529 --> 01:08:22.837
Worm, worm, here.
- Oh, thanks, man!

01:08:24.011 --> 01:08:25.622
- Oh my god, oh my god.

01:08:25.796 --> 01:08:27.189
- That's good!
- Come on, hurry.

01:08:27.363 --> 01:08:30.279
- That's really good!
- You're sickening.

01:08:34.935 --> 01:08:37.983
Flora, come on.

01:08:38.157 --> 01:08:40.116
Flora, Flora, come on!

01:08:40.290 --> 01:08:41.117
Come on.

01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:45.121
Come on.

01:08:45.295 --> 01:08:46.513
Keep on coming.

01:08:47.470 --> 01:08:48.471
Wait, no, no!

01:09:06.142 --> 01:09:07.011
No, no.

01:09:07.969 --> 01:09:08.796
No.

01:09:24.203 --> 01:09:26.162
Wait one second, Flora!

01:10:52.248 --> 01:10:56.774
Are you okay, Flora?

01:10:56.948 --> 01:10:57.775
- Dawn!

01:11:01.474 --> 01:11:02.258
Whoa.

01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:05.739
Are you hurt?

01:11:05.913 --> 01:11:07.350
- Who cares?

01:11:07.524 --> 01:11:08.873
I don't!

01:11:09.047 --> 01:11:10.266
- I'm getting rope.

01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:12.529
- No, no, call the cops first!

01:11:12.703 --> 01:11:15.488
Make sure I don't run away
and deprive you of your money.

01:11:20.058 --> 01:11:24.584
- I need rope.

01:11:30.460 --> 01:11:31.287
Okay.

01:11:32.157 --> 01:11:33.071
Watch your head!

01:11:38.250 --> 01:11:39.077
Put it around.

01:11:42.559 --> 01:11:44.212
- I know what to do.

01:12:13.546 --> 01:12:14.591
Get Flora to help!

01:12:16.723 --> 01:12:19.073
- What command do I
use to make her walk?

01:12:19.247 --> 01:12:20.336
- She's not a dog.

01:12:22.381 --> 01:12:24.514
Tell her what you want,
she'll understand.

01:12:24.688 --> 01:12:25.950
- Okay.

01:12:26.124 --> 01:12:26.951
Okay.

01:12:30.041 --> 01:12:31.085
Okay, Flora.

01:12:33.218 --> 01:12:35.786
Hey, I can't Dawn
up from that ledge.

01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:37.570
I can't get Dawn up from that
ledge without your help, okay?

01:13:01.202 --> 01:13:02.639
Come on, Flora.

01:13:02.813 --> 01:13:04.336
Get Dawn up from
that ledge, let's go.

01:13:04.510 --> 01:13:05.511
Come on, girl.

01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:20.744
That's it.

01:13:46.770 --> 01:13:51.688
- Hey.

01:13:53.211 --> 01:13:54.691
Hey.

01:13:54.865 --> 01:13:56.432
Hey, I am so sorry.

01:13:59.347 --> 01:14:01.175
I thought it was over.

01:14:03.613 --> 01:14:08.444
You did so good, such a
good girl, right?

01:14:09.401 --> 01:14:11.359
You're such a good girl.

01:14:12.578 --> 01:14:13.405
Hey.

01:14:15.451 --> 01:14:16.800
Eat up, alright?

01:14:19.846 --> 01:14:21.631
- You said apples
were her favorite.

01:14:31.510 --> 01:14:32.642
- That a girl.

01:14:44.697 --> 01:14:47.657
Searchers will be out soon.

01:14:47.831 --> 01:14:49.267
- They're wasting their time.

01:14:56.622 --> 01:14:58.494
Did you steal the bike?

01:14:59.669 --> 01:15:00.496
- No.

01:15:02.236 --> 01:15:03.150
- The food?

01:15:03.324 --> 01:15:04.195
- No.

01:15:06.763 --> 01:15:08.199
I stole the money that
I used to buy them.

01:15:08.373 --> 01:15:11.245
- Ah, there it is!

01:15:14.901 --> 01:15:17.513
- I stole them from the man
who texted me about Flora.

01:15:21.429 --> 01:15:22.735
He calls himself my uncle.

01:15:26.652 --> 01:15:30.221
I steal for him,
or, or he beats me.

01:15:33.137 --> 01:15:35.052
And sometimes he beats
me 'cause he likes to.

01:15:41.667 --> 01:15:43.234
I don't have a dad.

01:15:45.410 --> 01:15:47.064
So don't lose yours.

01:16:03.733 --> 01:16:04.734
- Woo!

01:16:06.953 --> 01:16:07.911
- We made it!

01:16:09.521 --> 01:16:10.478
Woo-hoo-hoo!

01:16:10.653 --> 01:16:12.219
- I am so proud of you.

01:16:12.393 --> 01:16:13.264
Woo!

01:16:14.787 --> 01:16:16.310
Woo-hoo-hoo!

01:16:43.947 --> 01:16:46.514
- My leg's starting to ache,
you know what that means right?

01:16:46.689 --> 01:16:48.560
- We get to kill the elephant.
- I get to kill the elephant.

01:16:48.734 --> 01:16:50.301
- Yeah, right, yeah.

01:16:50.475 --> 01:16:52.172
Yeah, you get to
kill the elephant.

01:16:52.346 --> 01:16:53.347
- And it's close.

01:16:54.566 --> 01:16:56.437
Can you feel it?

01:16:56.612 --> 01:16:57.351
It's really close.

01:16:57.525 --> 01:16:58.744
- I think I can feel it.

01:16:58.918 --> 01:16:59.963
- There it is!

01:17:00.137 --> 01:17:02.356
Just kidding.

01:17:31.385 --> 01:17:32.212
Flora.

01:17:54.234 --> 01:17:55.018
Hey, girl.

01:17:56.106 --> 01:17:59.370
Shh.

01:17:59.544 --> 01:18:02.155
- Hey, stop banging
around back there!

01:18:02.329 --> 01:18:03.722
- Yeah!

01:18:03.896 --> 01:18:05.028
- I don't want any
bruises on my trophy!

01:18:06.290 --> 01:18:08.858
- I need you to rock, alright?

01:18:09.032 --> 01:18:10.729
Rock, that a girl.

01:18:10.903 --> 01:18:14.211
- You know, I'm gonna pull
over and tie that beast down.

01:18:14.385 --> 01:18:15.865
- That makes sense.

01:18:19.477 --> 01:18:21.174
- Okay, here we go.

01:18:21.348 --> 01:18:22.219
Quiet!

01:18:23.394 --> 01:18:24.917
Quiet down, old lady!

01:18:27.441 --> 01:18:29.008
- Noisy.
- Alright, you get up there.

01:18:29.182 --> 01:18:32.490
I'll get you some rope.
- Wait, wait, up there?

01:18:32.664 --> 01:18:33.839
- Are you kidding?

01:18:34.013 --> 01:18:35.580
I have to do everything?

01:18:46.678 --> 01:18:48.419
- What's goin' on?

01:18:48.593 --> 01:18:50.116
Oh, wow.

01:18:50.290 --> 01:18:53.424
How'd the elephant
learn how to drive?

01:18:55.165 --> 01:18:56.732
Oh, that's gotta hurt.

01:19:00.910 --> 01:19:02.259
- My leg's broken.

01:19:02.433 --> 01:19:04.087
- Well, looks like that
elephant bagged herself

01:19:04.261 --> 01:19:06.350
a big game hunter, huh?

01:19:06.524 --> 01:19:08.047
- That's funny.
- Yeah.

01:19:09.527 --> 01:19:11.442
- You laugh again, your head's
gonna end up on the wall

01:19:11.616 --> 01:19:13.270
between Mick and
Kieth, you got it?

01:19:13.444 --> 01:19:14.793
- I got it.

01:19:16.490 --> 01:19:18.275
- Oh, that elephant!

01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:33.986
- Hey, excuse me, sir?

01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:35.640
Yeah, um, can you
tell me how to get

01:19:35.814 --> 01:19:37.468
to the elephant
preserve from here?

01:19:37.642 --> 01:19:39.731
Come on.

01:19:39.905 --> 01:19:41.777
- How did you get this?

01:20:15.767 --> 01:20:16.812
We're gonna make it.

01:20:16.986 --> 01:20:18.074
We're gonna make it!

01:20:18.248 --> 01:20:19.640
- Woo!

01:20:19.815 --> 01:20:20.685
Yes!

01:20:38.921 --> 01:20:40.183
- The cops are behind us.

01:20:40.357 --> 01:20:42.185
- Come on, girl,
you're almost home.

01:20:46.711 --> 01:20:49.192
- What about the money?

01:20:49.366 --> 01:20:50.976
- We've come so far.

01:20:52.673 --> 01:20:55.372
They wouldn't dare
turn her away.

01:21:54.257 --> 01:21:55.649
- Go, go, go, go!

01:21:57.608 --> 01:21:58.478
We got this.

01:21:58.652 --> 01:21:59.784
You got this.

01:22:07.139 --> 01:22:08.488
- Alright, Flora.

01:22:09.359 --> 01:22:10.447
- We made it.

01:22:23.460 --> 01:22:26.245
- Sir, sir, that's
my daughter driving.

01:22:28.508 --> 01:22:30.380
There's an elephant in there.

01:22:32.121 --> 01:22:34.819
She's gonna let it out, just
give it some room, guys.

01:22:39.693 --> 01:22:41.043
- Look, look.

01:22:41.217 --> 01:22:46.048
- Alright, come on, Flora.

01:23:05.937 --> 01:23:07.199
Come on, Flora.

01:23:07.373 --> 01:23:09.985
- And here they
are, Dawn and Flora.

01:23:10.159 --> 01:23:13.162
After a grueling 320-mile
journey, they have reached

01:23:13.336 --> 01:23:15.903
the gates of the Chilipingo
Elephant Preserve.

01:23:16.078 --> 01:23:17.340
- Who are all these people?

01:23:17.514 --> 01:23:19.168
- They're here to
see you and Flora!

01:23:33.095 --> 01:23:34.096
- Dawn.

01:23:34.270 --> 01:23:36.011
Dawn, it's great to meet you.

01:23:36.185 --> 01:23:38.665
You've been quite a journey.

01:23:38.839 --> 01:23:41.668
- Uh, I've been thinking
about Flora's fee.

01:23:41.842 --> 01:23:45.411
I can't pay it all at once,
but maybe I could work here,

01:23:45.585 --> 01:23:46.847
for free, you don't--
- No.

01:23:47.022 --> 01:23:48.458
Flora's fee has been paid.

01:23:50.547 --> 01:23:52.201
- Wait, what?

01:23:52.375 --> 01:23:53.898
- In fact, Flora's
journey has helped raise

01:23:54.072 --> 01:23:57.293
enough to sponsor four new
elephants in addition to Flora.

01:23:59.773 --> 01:24:02.254
- People all over the world
have been following your journey

01:24:02.428 --> 01:24:05.431
through The Incredible
Isabella's Instagram account.

01:24:09.609 --> 01:24:10.567
- Thank you.

01:24:12.003 --> 01:24:14.397
- I'm so proud of you.

01:24:14.571 --> 01:24:15.789
You're amazing.

01:24:21.578 --> 01:24:23.710
- I'm so glad you're safe.

01:24:26.104 --> 01:24:27.410
- I, um...

01:24:27.584 --> 01:24:28.846
I heard your voicemail.

01:24:30.021 --> 01:24:32.067
Thank you.
- So why didn't you come home?

01:24:33.938 --> 01:24:35.418
- It would have never been fair.

01:24:37.115 --> 01:24:38.595
You can't afford to keep Flora.

01:24:47.169 --> 01:24:50.911
Oh, uh, Dad, Isabella,
this is Sebastian.

01:24:52.652 --> 01:24:54.001
Couldn't have done
it without him.

01:24:54.176 --> 01:24:57.004
- Sebastian, thank
you, thank you so much.

01:24:58.702 --> 01:25:01.661
- Dawn says you were the greatest
candy butcher of all time.

01:25:01.835 --> 01:25:04.403
- "The greatest of all time,"
he sounds like a ringmaster.

01:25:04.577 --> 01:25:06.840
- Yeah, that's your job,
but I could be a clown.

01:25:07.014 --> 01:25:09.800
- Yeah, he's not
funny.

01:25:09.974 --> 01:25:11.628
- I'll start as a candy butcher.

01:25:11.802 --> 01:25:13.804
- More like you'll hot-wire
the cotton candy machine.

01:25:14.935 --> 01:25:17.503
See?

01:25:19.897 --> 01:25:20.724
Flora.

01:25:52.190 --> 01:25:54.366
You've made a new
friend already?

01:25:54.540 --> 01:25:55.715
- Maybe not so new.

01:25:57.282 --> 01:25:58.805
- What?

01:25:58.979 --> 01:26:01.373
- Well, I've been lookin'
into Flora's history.

01:26:01.547 --> 01:26:05.203
Flora was shipped from
Malaysia to New York in 1983,

01:26:05.377 --> 01:26:09.164
and from there, she went to
a circus in Wichita, Kansas.

01:26:09.338 --> 01:26:11.253
Flora's friend is
named Samantha.

01:26:11.427 --> 01:26:13.777
She's been with us for 16 years.

01:26:13.951 --> 01:26:17.346
She was two when we got her,
from the circus in Wichita.

01:26:18.390 --> 01:26:19.217
- The same one?

01:26:20.653 --> 01:26:23.569
- I was able to track down
someone who used to work there.

01:26:23.743 --> 01:26:26.703
She clearly remembers
an elephant giving birth

01:26:26.877 --> 01:26:29.662
shortly before
the circus closed.

01:26:29.836 --> 01:26:34.363
That elephant was sold
to the Ocotillo Circus.

01:26:34.537 --> 01:26:37.192
The elephant's baby came to us.

01:26:39.542 --> 01:26:40.369
Dawn.

01:26:41.805 --> 01:26:44.764
I wanna introduce you to
Flora's daughter, Samantha.

01:26:59.257 --> 01:27:00.563
- Hey, Samantha.

01:27:03.957 --> 01:27:04.784
- Wow.

01:27:14.664 --> 01:27:17.275
- Hi.

01:27:20.452 --> 01:27:21.540
Hi, Samantha.

01:27:25.327 --> 01:27:26.937
- You're beautiful.

01:27:49.742 --> 01:27:53.006
- Ladies and gentlemen!

01:27:53.180 --> 01:27:57.054
