02:54.041 --> 02:57.041
What came first?
The chicken or the egg?

02:57.541 --> 03:00.250
It’s important to see things as they are.

03:00.333 --> 03:03.208
On one hand you have
an awkward feathered thing

03:03.291 --> 03:07.416
and on the other you have the most perfect
aerodynamic shape that's ever evolved.

03:07.500 --> 03:08.916
The answer is...

03:11.333 --> 03:13.000
answer is obvious, right?

03:13.083 --> 03:16.875
Everything’s simple with you, professor.
Maybe you can explain my wife to me.

03:17.708 --> 03:20.875
-It was the egg, not the chicken, right?
-That depends.

03:21.625 --> 03:22.625
On what?

03:24.083 --> 03:26.208
On whether I'm having breakfast or dinner.

03:26.875 --> 03:29.291
Get out of here, professor.

04:00.041 --> 04:02.833
<i>We now know that the Soviet Union</i>

04:02.916 --> 04:05.541
<i>has decided</i>
<i>for putting all of the Americans</i>

04:05.625 --> 04:07.958
<i>-under the nuclear gun.</i>

04:08.791 --> 04:11.791
<i>Their major weapon systems,</i>
<i>which would affect this capability,</i>

04:11.875 --> 04:14.583
<i>appear to be nuclear propelled</i>
<i>and supersonic bombers.</i>

04:15.208 --> 04:17.708
<i>The aggressor would go as far as he could,</i>

04:17.791 --> 04:20.083
<i>to the very brink of war.</i>

04:22.041 --> 04:25.500
<i>Kennedy said that their administration</i>
<i>must take responsibility</i>

04:25.583 --> 04:26.875
<i>for the loss of Cuba.</i>

04:27.625 --> 04:29.291
<i>The free people of Cuba,</i>

04:29.791 --> 04:33.041
<i>people who want to be free</i>
<i>are going to be supported</i>

04:33.958 --> 04:36.041
<i>and that they will attain their freedom.</i>

04:49.833 --> 04:52.375
<i>In international news</i>
<i>the chess match of the century</i>

04:52.458 --> 04:54.333
<i>between grand master John Konigsberg</i>

04:54.416 --> 04:56.625
<i>and the Soviet challenger</i>
<i>grand master Gavrylov</i>

04:56.708 --> 05:00.541
<i>has finally been scheduled. The Chairman</i>
<i>of the American Chess Association,</i>

05:00.625 --> 05:03.125
<i>Mr. Griswald Moran,</i>
<i>made this announcement.</i>

05:03.208 --> 05:06.250
<i>I would like to personally thank</i>
<i>President Kennedy,</i>

05:06.750 --> 05:09.708
<i>who spoke to First Secretary Khrushchev</i>
<i>on our behalf</i>

05:09.791 --> 05:12.375
<i>and helped us come to an agreement</i>
<i>with the Soviets.</i>

05:12.833 --> 05:15.041
<i>The date of the tournament</i>
<i>remains unchanged.</i>

05:15.125 --> 05:18.541
<i>Both sides have agreed</i>
<i>to hold the games in Warsaw, Poland.</i>

05:19.875 --> 05:23.375
Yeah, well. I can't play
with all that crap in my ears.

05:23.458 --> 05:26.041
All they've been talking about
for the past two days

05:26.125 --> 05:27.833
is Konigsberg and that Russian,

05:27.916 --> 05:30.833
as though that’s going to bring
the Commies to their knees.

05:30.916 --> 05:32.333
Dealer takes one.

05:32.708 --> 05:35.958
Did you guys hear about
that Russian bomb called Tsar?

05:36.041 --> 05:38.500
-All in.
- They exploded one

05:38.583 --> 05:41.333
and the mushroom cloud was 40 miles high.

05:41.416 --> 05:44.041
-All in.
-Manhattan would be destroyed in...

05:44.708 --> 05:45.791
two seconds.

05:51.125 --> 05:52.291
And I call.

05:54.666 --> 05:55.625
Gentlemen.

05:57.833 --> 05:59.333
That's always a pleasure.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.875
Three hundred and 32 dollars.

06:02.958 --> 06:06.666
So my 15 percent would be
49 dollars and 80 cents.

06:06.875 --> 06:08.208
Here's 50 bucks.

06:13.541 --> 06:16.125
This Saturday
we're going to play blackjack.

06:16.208 --> 06:19.083
You are going to lose the
first two rounds

06:19.583 --> 06:23.166
and then make a miraculous recovery.

06:25.166 --> 06:26.333
You got it.

06:29.541 --> 06:31.166
Evening, miss. What'll it be?

06:31.666 --> 06:32.875
Double bourbon. Neat.

06:39.500 --> 06:40.791
Professor Mansky?

06:43.750 --> 06:46.791
You crossed my mind today
when I heard about that chess match

06:46.875 --> 06:48.833
between that Russian and Konigsberg.

06:50.750 --> 06:52.708
I remember when you were playing him.

06:54.208 --> 06:55.708
Everybody admired you.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.958
I was your student.

07:01.875 --> 07:03.250
That was a long time ago.

07:04.708 --> 07:06.708
Professor, I have a proposition for you.

07:08.916 --> 07:09.916
Pardon me.

07:16.750 --> 07:18.958
Excuse me? I think you forgot your...

07:41.583 --> 07:42.833
He’s waking up.

07:43.375 --> 07:44.791
He needs another shot.

07:44.875 --> 07:47.083
He’s not due for another 45.

07:47.958 --> 07:49.416
He’s got a strong liver.

08:10.875 --> 08:13.125
He woke up half an hour ago
in the safe room.

08:13.208 --> 08:16.541
He doesn't know where he is.
We waited for you before talking to him.

08:16.625 --> 08:20.041
Taught math at Princeton.
During Einstein’s tenure, no less.

08:20.375 --> 08:23.458
Dismissed for punching a Nobel laureate.
You brought a winner.

08:23.541 --> 08:26.291
He’s a genius at chess, sir.
He defeated Konigsberg twice.

08:26.375 --> 08:27.541
Yeah, 20 years ago.

08:40.125 --> 08:43.000
And this is the guy
you want to win the Cold War for us?

08:53.916 --> 08:54.875
Go ahead.

09:07.125 --> 09:09.333
Professor Mansky, can you hear me?

09:18.416 --> 09:21.500
I taught for nine years.
I never had a female student.

09:24.708 --> 09:28.041
What I'm about to tell you, sir,
is highly confidential.

09:28.125 --> 09:30.208
The President and the State Department...

09:30.291 --> 09:32.416
You'd come up with the genius plan.

09:34.583 --> 09:37.333
-We have a lot to tell you...
-You gonna tell me

09:37.416 --> 09:40.708
that I should pretend to be Konigsberg
or maybe ask me

09:40.791 --> 09:44.375
to send messages
about different moves he can make

09:44.458 --> 09:47.375
by tapping Morse code
by the teaspoon or something.

09:47.458 --> 09:49.833
And this all in the name
of the State Department

09:49.916 --> 09:53.625
and the President of the United States,
and it happens in a sound-proofed box.

09:54.625 --> 09:58.291
-Guess what? I'm not interested.
-Impressive. Everything you said is true.

09:58.375 --> 10:01.458
But there’s more. Konigsberg suffered
a stroke a few days ago.

10:01.541 --> 10:03.333
He’s dead and nobody knows about it.

10:03.500 --> 10:07.208
A loophole in the regulations allows us
to replace him with another player.

10:08.375 --> 10:10.833
The Russians have to accept
or they face a forfeit.

10:12.166 --> 10:14.708
There is no plan B.
We need you to be a patriot.

10:15.833 --> 10:18.083
Oh God. That word.

10:20.625 --> 10:21.458
Hey.

10:24.041 --> 10:26.250
Why isn't my cell touching the ground?

10:29.333 --> 10:32.583
You're worried about what’s underneath us.

10:35.208 --> 10:37.291
We're not on home territory, are we?

10:37.375 --> 10:38.625
No, professor.

10:39.791 --> 10:41.208
That’s the other thing.

10:41.291 --> 10:43.708
We're in a safe room,
U.S. Embassy, Warsaw.

11:12.458 --> 11:15.208
This just came in. Encrypted, code orange.

11:17.875 --> 11:19.125
We're not thirsty.

11:20.875 --> 11:24.458
The Soviet's ship will dock earlier
in Cuba. We have only four days

11:24.541 --> 11:27.916
and Konigsberg’s autopsy shows
traces of ricin in his system.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.833
The same kind the Soviets use.

11:30.416 --> 11:33.666
If he was poisoned, that means
the Soviets know about our mission,

11:34.291 --> 11:37.416
-so we have a mole in Washington.
-I need to know every detail

11:37.500 --> 11:40.458
-of this operation.
-You know the protocol, agent Novak.

11:41.666 --> 11:43.541
I don't even have all the details.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.833
Agent White is gonna contact our source,

11:45.916 --> 11:48.625
-I will support him, you will protect us.
-We're buying time.

11:49.625 --> 11:51.750
Even if Mansky loses
the first three games,

11:51.833 --> 11:54.458
that gives us five days
to contact John Gift.

11:54.541 --> 11:57.750
You understand you're risking
more than my men or this station.

11:57.833 --> 12:01.083
They hang people here
for this kind of business.

12:04.083 --> 12:06.458
<i>The convoy approaching Cuba</i>
<i>may indicate change</i>

12:06.541 --> 12:09.916
<i>in the Soviet strategy</i>
<i>and an unannounced, rapid attack</i>

12:10.000 --> 12:12.833
<i>using medium-range missiles</i>
<i>deployed on the island,</i>

12:12.916 --> 12:16.000
<i>which would break U.S. hegemony</i>
<i>in the Western Hemisphere</i>

12:16.083 --> 12:18.416
<i>and shorten retaliation time</i>
<i>to four minutes.</i>

12:23.875 --> 12:24.958
Mr. Mansky?

12:29.791 --> 12:31.125
Professor? May we come in?

12:32.083 --> 12:34.208
You know I will agree to play.

12:37.125 --> 12:39.625
Who told you what happened in 1945?

12:41.166 --> 12:42.500
What do you mean?

12:44.625 --> 12:46.125
You don’t know.

12:48.791 --> 12:50.416
Can we brief you about today?

12:52.291 --> 12:55.125
You want me to win,
I gotta get some rest.

12:55.625 --> 12:57.625
-We leave at 3:00.
- Go away.

13:03.750 --> 13:05.333
Mr. Novak, sir...

13:07.291 --> 13:09.541
Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen.

13:09.625 --> 13:12.833
Please, I recognize you all
from your passport photos.

13:12.916 --> 13:15.833
My name's Donald Novak.
I am the embassy attaché

13:15.916 --> 13:18.083
in charge of your stay in Warsaw.

13:18.166 --> 13:21.041
You've been briefed on the plane
about our difficult situation.

13:21.500 --> 13:25.125
We've decided to keep the Soviets
in the dark to the last minute.

13:25.208 --> 13:27.708
We will arrive just before
the opening ceremony begins.

13:27.791 --> 13:31.833
And then, Mr. Moran will present them
with the announcement.

13:31.916 --> 13:34.083
-We'll see what they decide.
-Thank you.

13:34.166 --> 13:36.916
As chairman
of the American Chess association...

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
Excuse me.

13:38.083 --> 13:41.375
Sir, we have a problem.
You need to be in a guest room.

13:43.125 --> 13:45.708
Dr. Stone and Mr. White
from <i>Life Magazine.</i>

13:45.791 --> 13:48.000
Could you come with me, please?

13:48.083 --> 13:50.875
We've had an issue with their visas.
We’ll be just a minute.

14:01.333 --> 14:02.166
Professor?

14:05.625 --> 14:07.166
Christ, not another one.

14:08.833 --> 14:10.208
He’s alive.

14:10.708 --> 14:13.791
He’s alive, alright and three sheets
to the goddamn wind.

14:15.125 --> 14:16.625
Phenobarbital.

14:16.708 --> 14:18.333
We are lucky his heart is still beating.

14:26.458 --> 14:29.458
An amphetamine derivative.
We won World War II thanks to this.

14:29.541 --> 14:31.208
It’ll put a spring in your step.

14:33.125 --> 14:35.291
- It’ll take effect faster if you gum it.

14:38.625 --> 14:41.500
-I don't get anything...
-Ok. Just give it a moment.

15:06.333 --> 15:08.166
Bravo!

15:08.250 --> 15:10.083
The Mazowsze folk band!

15:13.875 --> 15:16.083
How long does it last, this stuff?

15:17.083 --> 15:19.583
Everything looks strange.

15:20.666 --> 15:21.875
What’s that?

15:21.958 --> 15:24.291
This will be our home
for the next few days.

15:26.250 --> 15:28.458
It's The Palace
of Culture and Science.

15:28.541 --> 15:30.250
Stalin’s gift to the people of Poland.

15:38.250 --> 15:40.250
Ladies and gentlemen!

15:41.416 --> 15:44.125
I would like to welcome

15:44.208 --> 15:47.208
Yuri Siergeyevich Gavrylov,

15:47.291 --> 15:50.708
representing the U.S.S.R., to the stage!

15:51.958 --> 15:54.166
Thank you!

15:55.916 --> 16:00.041
<i>May this chess match,</i>
<i>played in the heroic city of Warsaw,</i>

16:00.791 --> 16:03.708
<i>aide in the perseverance of peace</i>

16:04.416 --> 16:06.250
<i>and friendship among nations.</i>

16:07.500 --> 16:09.416
<i>-Thank you!</i>
- <i>Bravo!</i>

16:09.500 --> 16:11.958
Thank you for those wonderful words.

16:30.750 --> 16:32.000
Your statement.

16:34.625 --> 16:38.708
The Soviet Chess Committee agrees
to your substitute player.

16:41.041 --> 16:42.791
What about Grandmaster Gavrylov?

16:44.166 --> 16:45.208
He'll agree as well.

16:49.958 --> 16:51.958
<i>I will now read a statement</i>

16:52.041 --> 16:55.875
<i>I just received</i>
<i>from the American delegation.</i>

16:56.625 --> 16:58.208
Here we go.

16:58.916 --> 16:59.875
Here we go.

16:59.958 --> 17:02.708
<i>We regret to announce</i>

17:02.791 --> 17:07.958
that the US representative,
grand master Konigsberg,

17:08.916 --> 17:10.125
has passed away.

17:13.875 --> 17:17.041
As stated in the ordinance
of the International Chess Federation,

17:17.125 --> 17:20.333
<i>either side has the right</i>
<i>to appoint a replacement</i>

17:20.416 --> 17:23.833
if the replacement was the last one
to defeat the original contender

17:23.916 --> 17:25.291
in a sanctioned match.

17:25.791 --> 17:29.750
Grandmaster Konigsberg
was defeated 17 years ago

17:30.041 --> 17:31.458
by professor...

17:32.125 --> 17:35.000
Joshua Mansky.

17:35.750 --> 17:38.458
Before I invite
professor Mansky to the stage,

17:38.541 --> 17:41.916
I would like to propose
a moment of silence

17:42.000 --> 17:45.333
to honor the late grand master Konigsberg.

17:57.083 --> 18:01.583
Since the Soviet delegation
is not protesting,

18:01.666 --> 18:06.083
we can move on to the symbolic
first move of the tournament,

18:06.625 --> 18:08.875
which will begin tomorrow!

18:10.583 --> 18:13.416
There will be five games.

18:13.500 --> 18:16.083
Each game that's won is worth a point.

18:16.166 --> 18:19.458
A draw is worth half a point
for each player.

18:19.541 --> 18:22.000
The first player to reach three points

18:22.083 --> 18:25.666
will walk away the victor!

18:26.333 --> 18:29.541
As agreed, grand master Gavrylov
will make the first move

18:29.625 --> 18:31.375
and will use the white pieces.

18:33.000 --> 18:36.416
And now, the representative
of the United States, Mr. Mansky.

18:44.666 --> 18:45.916
<i>Your answer, sir.</i>

18:48.875 --> 18:50.208
Your answer, sir.

19:04.250 --> 19:05.625
What the fuck.

19:06.625 --> 19:12.041
<i>Once more for your pleasure:</i>
<i>the Mazowsze band!</i>

19:25.000 --> 19:28.291
A dramatic turn of events in a match

19:28.375 --> 19:31.291
deemed more important
than the World Championship!

19:31.375 --> 19:33.083
Office. Write down!

19:33.166 --> 19:38.000
Joshua Mansky,
a wunderkind that debuted at 13...

19:38.083 --> 19:43.041
Gavrylov was not provoked
by the Americans' deceptive tactics...

19:43.750 --> 19:46.875
I was going to apply the I.V.,

19:47.250 --> 19:50.625
when professor Mansky grabbed
the rubbing alcohol and drank it.

19:50.708 --> 19:54.583
His reaction was out of the ordinary
to say the least.

19:55.125 --> 19:57.958
He calmed down and became focused.

19:58.041 --> 20:01.625
I pass it he needs psychoactive agents

20:01.708 --> 20:04.458
to block the communication
between his dendrites

20:04.541 --> 20:06.083
and neurons in his brain.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.375
The alcohol straightened him out,

20:11.458 --> 20:15.083
slowed down his brain activity
to that of a normal person.

20:15.833 --> 20:17.750
So, you say normally he’s not normal?

20:17.833 --> 20:21.250
In the same way that you could say
Einstein wasn't normal.

20:34.708 --> 20:35.958
Professor?

20:40.833 --> 20:43.458
We're almost done.
There's nothing to worry about.

20:43.541 --> 20:45.916
-You're doing a great job.
-I need a drink.

20:47.875 --> 20:51.291
Our Palace is radiating over Warsaw,

20:51.750 --> 20:53.708
has 46 floors,

20:54.708 --> 20:58.416
three thousand 288 rooms,

20:59.083 --> 21:01.000
theaters, swimming pools,

21:01.291 --> 21:03.333
and museum of technology.

21:03.958 --> 21:06.375
As the director
of Palace of Culture and Science,

21:06.458 --> 21:08.416
I like to greet our visitors

21:08.750 --> 21:11.416
with respectable traditional offering...

21:11.500 --> 21:13.041
Welcome and good night.

21:13.541 --> 21:14.916
Professor.

21:17.458 --> 21:22.541
Traditional offering starts with bread

21:22.625 --> 21:23.708
and salt.

21:29.041 --> 21:30.875
And, of course, welcome drink.

21:43.458 --> 21:44.708
Professor,

21:45.833 --> 21:51.416
we have of course
army of people for our guest.

21:51.791 --> 21:55.750
But for great masters like professor,

21:56.458 --> 21:59.333
I personally take care.

21:59.416 --> 22:03.416
Someone from the embassy will bring
a suitcase with everything you might need.

22:04.416 --> 22:06.625
I really don't know
what happened out there.

22:06.708 --> 22:10.041
He made his first move,
I thought of about 8900 responses.

22:10.125 --> 22:13.750
-I haven't been playing very much lately.
- You did well today.

22:14.291 --> 22:15.666
Try to get some sleep.

22:15.958 --> 22:18.875
It might come down to the Rousseau
or the Two Knights defense.

22:18.958 --> 22:20.500
Do you know what the difference is?

22:22.625 --> 22:24.791
There isn't any. And that worries me.

22:29.333 --> 22:30.875
We've got a big day tomorrow.

22:55.250 --> 22:56.416
Good evening.

23:06.833 --> 23:09.333
- You probably know who I am.
-I do.

23:10.333 --> 23:11.166
Good.

23:13.708 --> 23:16.125
What they say is true:
a man's name precedes him.

23:17.041 --> 23:19.750
And whatever you heard I am,
I am just that.

23:19.833 --> 23:20.875
Well, maybe...

23:21.875 --> 23:23.041
a little worse.

23:26.041 --> 23:27.958
Do the Americans like their rooms?

23:28.041 --> 23:29.583
Very much so.

23:38.041 --> 23:42.458
Will you be the best host to our guests?

23:43.041 --> 23:47.125
This is Poland.
Hospitality runs in our blood.

23:49.250 --> 23:53.166
And it will as long as it does not disturb
the friendship among our nations.

23:53.250 --> 23:54.166
Goodbye.

23:54.916 --> 23:57.416
Thank you for extending
the use of your office

23:57.500 --> 23:59.416
during my stay.

23:59.500 --> 24:02.916
-I'm glad I could help.
-Today was a good day.

24:05.041 --> 24:06.958
Tomorrow will be a better one.

24:15.916 --> 24:18.708
Check what they're saying
on the American floor.

24:19.208 --> 24:20.291
Yes, General Major.

25:12.916 --> 25:14.083
Professor.

25:14.166 --> 25:16.833
It’s 11:30 p.m., not a.m. What happened?

25:16.916 --> 25:18.791
What happened with what?

25:18.875 --> 25:22.250
That director came over with breakfast.

25:22.333 --> 25:24.333
Morning, it's good breakfast.

25:24.416 --> 25:26.083
Voilà.

25:26.166 --> 25:28.416
...and we had this cultural exchange.

25:29.416 --> 25:31.541
Best juice for breakfast

25:31.625 --> 25:33.291
is not from orange,

25:33.375 --> 25:36.166
but from... potato.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.416
What happened with the game?

25:51.083 --> 25:52.500
Professor, you won.

25:53.833 --> 25:54.833
I won?

26:04.750 --> 26:07.583
It was incredible.
They called it a "classic knockout".

26:07.916 --> 26:10.041
Gavrylov gave up after 32 moves.

26:11.250 --> 26:12.875
<i>At the very beginning,</i>

26:12.958 --> 26:15.416
<i>you sacrificed a knight</i>
<i>for Gavrylov’s bishop.</i>

26:15.708 --> 26:17.666
<i> And then I sacrificed</i>

26:17.750 --> 26:19.083
my bishop for his knight.

26:19.166 --> 26:22.041
And then you took his queen
and immediately he took yours.

26:22.125 --> 26:23.625
And I gave up my knight,

26:23.708 --> 26:27.666
Gavrylov gave up his other bishop
and we both ended up with a rook.

26:27.750 --> 26:29.333
So, you do remember?

26:30.958 --> 26:32.500
Not at all.

26:33.250 --> 26:35.708
-Can I have a beer? Please.
-Of course.

26:35.791 --> 26:36.625
Thank you.

26:39.500 --> 26:41.541
I think I'm beginning to understand.

26:42.958 --> 26:44.875
-What?
-You.

26:53.958 --> 26:56.125
<i>You gave away the rook</i>
<i>and your other bishop.</i>

27:00.583 --> 27:02.333
<i>You were impervious to his moves</i>

27:05.541 --> 27:07.625
<i>and didn't attack any of his pieces.</i>

27:10.916 --> 27:12.750
<i>Everyone thought you are going mad.</i>

27:15.000 --> 27:16.916
<i>But then, you made one move</i>

27:19.708 --> 27:21.041
<i>and it all made sense.</i>

27:32.000 --> 27:34.291
<i>It was unbelievable. Everyone screamed.</i>

27:34.875 --> 27:37.416
<i>Moran said, "We just witnessed</i>

27:37.500 --> 27:38.916
<i>history in the making."</i>

27:45.125 --> 27:47.250
I think you're underestimating yourself,

27:49.333 --> 27:50.791
but I always believed in you.

27:52.708 --> 27:54.500
You're quite the genius.

28:01.208 --> 28:03.041
You would have made a good student.

28:05.750 --> 28:07.083
But I think...

28:11.791 --> 28:15.708
I got to have a beer for the road,
if you don't mind.

28:18.250 --> 28:19.291
Thank you.

28:21.791 --> 28:23.166
Good night, professor.

28:25.833 --> 28:26.666
Good night.

28:54.666 --> 28:59.375
He swears he was
so drunk he wasn't even conscious.

28:59.458 --> 29:02.583
Never underestimate a man
that can drink you under the table.

29:11.500 --> 29:12.458
Anything else?

29:13.583 --> 29:15.333
Comrade Gavrylov asked to see you.

29:16.875 --> 29:20.041
Interesting. And bold on his part.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
Come in!

29:32.083 --> 29:34.083
Dear Yuri Sergeyevich!

29:35.625 --> 29:37.208
Why the sad demeanor?

29:37.291 --> 29:40.583
Chess isn't the five-year plan.
You can't foresee everything.

29:40.666 --> 29:43.083
One can argue
that it's good that you lost.

29:43.166 --> 29:46.708
Your inevitable victory must come
from a hard battle.

29:48.750 --> 29:51.208
Otherwise, what will winning be worth?

29:52.708 --> 29:55.208
I understand. There's something else.

29:56.541 --> 29:59.916
After the first few moves,
I thought he was some...

30:00.000 --> 30:02.208
Buffoon.

30:03.541 --> 30:05.791
Don't look at him this way.

30:06.291 --> 30:09.583
See him as a part of a greater whole.

30:12.208 --> 30:16.083
I know I disappointed you.
I've already learned an important lesson.

30:16.750 --> 30:19.791
The Party is behind you
and the Party will always help you.

30:19.875 --> 30:22.375
We are fighting
for the freedom of humanity.

30:24.416 --> 30:26.208
The truth can only belong to us.

30:27.875 --> 30:30.625
Thank you, comrade Krutov.

30:30.708 --> 30:31.625
Sasha.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.958
Get the Palace Director on the phone.

30:37.833 --> 30:40.500
Not a chess player,
but a whiny little cunt.

30:48.791 --> 30:50.500
Good morning, comrade director.

30:51.458 --> 30:55.125
To make sure we keep chess
as the highest priority of this game,

30:55.208 --> 30:59.708
I'd like you to stop providing alcohol
to the American delegation's quarters.

31:01.333 --> 31:04.916
They might complain later that we won
because we got them drunk.

31:06.041 --> 31:07.250
That's an order!

31:18.750 --> 31:22.083
I don’t really do this.

31:22.166 --> 31:23.000
No.

31:23.083 --> 31:25.791
Men of a distinguished age
look good on you, Dr. Stone.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.500
Excuse me, professor.

31:37.625 --> 31:39.291
The ambassadors aren’t coming.

31:39.666 --> 31:42.000
A reporter
in Washington got the White House leak

31:42.083 --> 31:44.666
and asked Khrushchev point-blank
about missiles in Cuba.

31:44.750 --> 31:46.208
He must have got pissed.

31:46.291 --> 31:48.583
He is threatening to pull
his ambassador from D.C.

31:48.666 --> 31:50.875
-Any contact with Gift?
-Negative.

31:50.958 --> 31:53.041
Any contact with anyone?
Some Soviet officer

31:53.125 --> 31:55.666
drifting off by himself?
We're under a time constraint.

31:56.750 --> 31:58.583
- How long do we have?
- 48 hours.

31:59.250 --> 32:00.708
What about the mole in Washington?

32:00.791 --> 32:03.375
Let’s just worry about Gift,
then about the mole.

32:13.791 --> 32:17.583
Wait. See the guy
that the Russians are standing around?

32:18.125 --> 32:20.916
General Major Krutov.
He’s Russian counterintelligence,

32:21.000 --> 32:23.250
responsible for
the sting operation in Moscow.

32:23.875 --> 32:25.875
When did you plan on telling me that?

32:26.666 --> 32:29.375
Maybe this is a good moment
to start breaking procedure

32:29.458 --> 32:33.083
-and tell each other what we know.
-I can't give any details of my mission

32:33.166 --> 32:35.458
-to anyone, even you.
-Can he recognize you?

32:37.333 --> 32:39.833
If he could,
I'd be dead in Moscow like the others.

32:49.875 --> 32:51.791
I'll see you at the game tomorrow.

32:58.083 --> 33:02.458
-Excuse me, gentlemen. It's time to go.
-I guess that means the party’s over.

33:02.541 --> 33:04.041
A lot of things are over.

33:04.125 --> 33:07.583
-We have to get back to the Palace.
-If you would just excuse me.

33:07.666 --> 33:10.541
-I'll get a little food for the road.
-Nobody asked me...

33:29.166 --> 33:30.500
What's going on here?

33:33.583 --> 33:36.708
- It’s okay.
- They're showing who’s in charge.

33:37.208 --> 33:38.458
It’s okay.

33:38.541 --> 33:40.500
Let them go! Move it!

34:11.791 --> 34:15.500
<i>The US has begun military</i>
<i>maneuvers designed to hide the fact</i>

34:15.583 --> 34:18.416
<i>that our entire army on the east coast</i>
<i>is been mobilized.</i>

34:18.500 --> 34:21.041
<i>Our ambassador here is ready to evacuate.</i>

34:21.625 --> 34:24.083
<i>All classified papers are to be burnt.</i>

34:24.833 --> 34:27.916
<i>The Warsaw Pact has put its troops</i>
<i>on military alert.</i>

34:29.041 --> 34:32.708
<i>The Soviets have already sent</i>
<i>more than twenty ships towards Cuba,</i>

34:33.458 --> 34:36.750
<i>all of them are carrying</i>
<i>radioactive cargo.</i>

34:38.833 --> 34:41.625
<i>The U.S. Navy has designated a zone</i>

34:41.708 --> 34:44.250
<i>that the Russian convoy cannot cross.</i>

34:54.041 --> 34:55.375
It looks like war.

35:20.541 --> 35:22.000
How’s our dark horse?

35:23.458 --> 35:24.416
Not bad.

35:25.333 --> 35:29.000
God protects children, drunks,
and the United States, as they say.

35:29.666 --> 35:32.250
I hope that’s true and he doesn't fail us.

35:34.041 --> 35:35.583
Mansky will be fine.

35:36.083 --> 35:37.625
I was talking about God.

35:55.958 --> 35:57.125
I’m sorry.

35:58.541 --> 35:59.666
Genadiy Stepanovich,

35:59.750 --> 36:02.750
the rat will show his head
in the next 48 hours.

36:06.208 --> 36:07.708
We're counting on you.

36:10.791 --> 36:13.083
The Americans recognized you.

36:16.333 --> 36:19.416
Good. They'll have
something to be afraid of.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.833
He's ahead again.
t's like in the first game.

37:39.958 --> 37:42.875
Those moves were strange.
Like he changed his whole strategy.

37:42.958 --> 37:44.750
I'm gonna walk down to him
during the break.

38:14.041 --> 38:15.708
Bravo.

38:16.083 --> 38:19.708
Today's winner
is the grand master Gavrylov.

38:19.791 --> 38:21.625
This happened in Switzerland.

38:21.708 --> 38:24.208
They hired a hypnotist
to distract our player.

38:30.125 --> 38:30.958
Let’s go!

38:52.125 --> 38:54.708
Your wife is due to deliver any day.

38:56.208 --> 38:57.791
You have a family, daddy.

39:10.666 --> 39:13.708
If I understand correctly,
your job is to protect our player.

39:13.791 --> 39:15.791
-Please...
-And what you don't understand

39:15.875 --> 39:17.625
is to win this match the Soviets...

39:31.666 --> 39:33.375
What you did was unacceptable!

39:33.458 --> 39:36.416
- Accept the defeat.
-Take your hands off me!

39:36.500 --> 39:37.583
How dare you?

39:43.166 --> 39:45.166
Stop! No!

39:46.083 --> 39:47.875
No! You can't!

39:48.458 --> 39:50.916
Checkmate! The lift's waiting.

39:51.666 --> 39:53.583
Chess. Good manners.

40:19.791 --> 40:21.541
They even know she’s pregnant.

40:26.666 --> 40:27.750
Don’t worry.

40:28.833 --> 40:31.833
We'll find Gift and we'll be out of here.

40:33.291 --> 40:35.541
-You'll go back home to your wife.
-I saw him.

40:36.958 --> 40:38.708
You saw Gift? When?

40:41.041 --> 40:42.250
Before I got stopped.

40:43.166 --> 40:44.291
This is good.

40:45.541 --> 40:47.125
That means he’s in Warsaw.

40:48.166 --> 40:49.875
How can we identify him?

40:51.166 --> 40:53.125
I’d have to contact headquarters.

40:55.791 --> 40:57.041
I understand.

42:34.583 --> 42:36.666
The bar.

42:46.041 --> 42:47.041
Goodnight.

42:51.916 --> 42:54.375
Pure. Varsovian.

43:00.625 --> 43:03.583
- Toilet!
-Secret system of communication.

43:03.666 --> 43:04.666
My idea.

43:04.750 --> 43:06.958
One, two, three, four.

43:07.041 --> 43:08.208
Number three.

43:08.916 --> 43:10.958
Medicine for morning.

43:15.166 --> 43:16.291
After chess...

43:19.291 --> 43:20.625
or during.

43:20.708 --> 43:21.625
Come.

43:30.458 --> 43:31.958
Stop.

43:34.833 --> 43:35.666
Come!

43:41.958 --> 43:44.500
Germans destroy everything.

43:45.583 --> 43:48.291
Hitler’s personal order.

43:48.375 --> 43:51.625
To destroy. But we build it again.

43:53.625 --> 43:55.541
I am starting to see some lights.

43:56.291 --> 43:58.416
I show you, here look.

44:00.541 --> 44:02.708
Ehm. Here.

44:03.916 --> 44:05.500
Palace of Culture,

44:06.000 --> 44:08.333
big river, <i>Wisła...</i>

44:09.250 --> 44:11.166
and here American Embassy.

44:11.916 --> 44:13.500
It's okay...

44:14.250 --> 44:17.125
D4, F6, C4,

44:17.833 --> 44:19.875
E5, E6..

44:20.500 --> 44:22.500
You play chess always.

44:22.583 --> 44:24.791
C5, D5...

44:25.375 --> 44:26.208
B5.

44:27.750 --> 44:30.125
-The Blumenfeld Gambit.
<i>-Bruderschaft.</i>

44:30.625 --> 44:32.958
I show you. Polish tradition.

44:34.000 --> 44:35.750
Vodka and now drink.

44:39.291 --> 44:42.291
- And kiss. One, two, tree.

44:43.708 --> 44:45.375
Alfred. My name, Alfred.

44:47.458 --> 44:48.583
Joshua.

44:48.666 --> 44:50.750
-Joszek.
-Why, Alfred?

44:51.333 --> 44:52.791
Why do you take this risk?

44:52.875 --> 44:54.625
It's so much trouble.

44:55.125 --> 44:57.875
Joszek, you're a good man.

44:58.250 --> 44:59.625
You are my guest.

45:00.458 --> 45:02.083
I show you my <i>Warszawa.</i>

45:10.750 --> 45:12.583
We are two floors underground.

45:13.250 --> 45:17.666
And upstairs is stage
where you play with Gavrylov.

45:27.416 --> 45:31.000
<i>Our history of Poland</i>
<i>very complicated.</i>

45:31.583 --> 45:36.833
<i>All time between Germans and Russia,</i>
<i>fighting for freedom.</i>

45:38.083 --> 45:41.833
I was communist before war
and I am proud of it.

45:43.083 --> 45:43.916
But...

45:44.666 --> 45:47.708
I never believed Stalin, never.

45:49.875 --> 45:50.791
And now

45:51.500 --> 45:56.000
these servants of Soviets made me?

45:57.416 --> 45:58.916
In my own country?

45:59.666 --> 46:03.666
Director of their Palace of Culture?

46:04.250 --> 46:05.083
Me,

46:06.500 --> 46:08.458
colonel of underground army!

46:17.583 --> 46:19.833
Welcome to Warsaw.

46:21.208 --> 46:24.875
How we call, "the Paris of the North."

46:31.750 --> 46:33.791
Oh, here.

46:35.166 --> 46:37.375
Children, women,

46:37.875 --> 46:39.291
civilians here.

46:39.375 --> 46:41.541
And there...

46:42.541 --> 46:44.333
15 German soldiers.

46:45.458 --> 46:47.416
Me and my gun only.

46:48.125 --> 46:49.666
Only one gun.

46:49.750 --> 46:52.166
So, I shot.

46:52.250 --> 46:53.666
Bam, bang.

46:55.958 --> 46:57.791
Eight German bastards

46:58.375 --> 46:59.250
dead.

47:00.041 --> 47:01.166
The rest run.

47:04.708 --> 47:06.041
Women and children...

47:07.416 --> 47:08.375
survived.

47:17.875 --> 47:19.708
The Soviets wait

47:20.708 --> 47:22.541
on the other side of river

47:23.916 --> 47:25.083
for half year.

47:26.583 --> 47:27.583
Half year.

47:29.583 --> 47:31.583
Not giving us any help.

47:35.083 --> 47:36.500
Looking, as Germans...

47:38.500 --> 47:39.583
As Germans...

47:41.750 --> 47:44.125
How do you say,
"bleed us dry"? Fuck.

47:46.791 --> 47:48.083
Joszek...

47:50.250 --> 47:52.250
you cannot imagine.

47:53.791 --> 47:55.666
Dead bodies everywhere.

48:03.500 --> 48:04.833
I lost my faith.

48:12.291 --> 48:17.375
I don't really know the things you saw,
maybe little with the...

48:20.166 --> 48:21.916
in terms of the whole game

48:24.000 --> 48:26.458
only sacrifice can bring you
great strength.

48:27.833 --> 48:28.708
Really.

48:31.333 --> 48:32.500
I lost my soul.

48:38.875 --> 48:40.750
This is mad world, Joszek.

48:43.000 --> 48:45.083
You must be careful.

48:47.083 --> 48:48.083
Trust me.

48:49.625 --> 48:52.291
- Militia! Drop the gun!

48:53.125 --> 48:54.125
Drop the gun!

49:02.750 --> 49:03.583
Clean.

49:14.958 --> 49:16.750
Give the comrade his gun back.

49:17.291 --> 49:20.958
I'd like to sincerely apologize.
I'll write a grievance report on myself.

49:21.583 --> 49:24.750
-I have a wife and kids. A flat...
- Attention!

49:25.958 --> 49:29.291
About face! Get the fuck out of here!

49:35.708 --> 49:37.541
They run like fascist.

49:41.958 --> 49:45.166
We are here. Almost here.

49:55.416 --> 49:56.666
Mietek!

49:56.750 --> 49:58.166
-Fredek!
-Mieciu!

50:00.458 --> 50:02.666
Hi. Oh, my sweet.

50:04.750 --> 50:06.500
You have a lot of friends here.

50:07.125 --> 50:08.958
They are good people.

50:09.541 --> 50:12.416
-And they cheer for you. Not that Rusek.

50:12.500 --> 50:14.000
Excuse me.

50:15.125 --> 50:17.958
I've brought you beef goulash.
I made it myself.

50:22.666 --> 50:25.291
- Won't you introduce me?
-Professor.

50:26.125 --> 50:28.791
This is Gienia and she is my...

50:30.416 --> 50:32.875
She's nice and...

50:33.750 --> 50:36.958
I love America and James Dean.

50:37.041 --> 50:39.916
I'll bring you better vodka.

50:40.333 --> 50:42.250
Kryśka! Get me the special one!

50:42.333 --> 50:44.500
Tell your friend

50:44.583 --> 50:46.416
he should not take the next card

50:46.500 --> 50:49.458
because statistically,
he’s not going to get a face card.

50:49.541 --> 50:51.791
-How do you know?
-I know, right now!

50:53.666 --> 50:56.291
Damn it! It's the fourth time!

50:56.375 --> 50:59.083
Joszek, you're amazing.

51:00.000 --> 51:02.875
We drink and I'm drunk...

51:04.125 --> 51:06.708
you're drunk and still genius.
How do you do it?

51:07.000 --> 51:10.208
Pure math and pure vodka.

51:14.708 --> 51:16.375
Maybe you wanna play?

51:48.125 --> 51:49.625
Hallo?

51:59.875 --> 52:02.583
- Hey.
- Good morning, professor. How are you?

52:03.083 --> 52:05.958
I'm... Fine.

52:06.041 --> 52:09.000
Left these outside your door last night.
You weren't thirsty?

52:09.083 --> 52:12.625
I hadn't got to them. Are you alright?

52:12.708 --> 52:14.791
-Yup, I am well.
-Aha.

52:19.583 --> 52:21.708
The others don’t know I’m here.

52:22.375 --> 52:23.791
Oh.

52:25.125 --> 52:26.958
-I see.
-Do you mind if I seat down?

52:27.541 --> 52:28.375
Sure.

52:33.125 --> 52:36.041
-Are you ready for today’s game?
-I have been preparing...

52:38.583 --> 52:40.000
Why don't you open up a beer?

52:41.500 --> 52:42.833
Okay.

52:46.000 --> 52:48.791
During the game,
someone might approach you

52:48.875 --> 52:51.291
could be in a Soviet uniform,
but he’s a friend.

52:51.375 --> 52:54.541
Besides me, the only other person
he knows he can trust is you.

52:57.208 --> 53:01.791
How about if I open up
another beer for you.

53:01.875 --> 53:03.833
Who is this?

53:03.916 --> 53:07.041
This man has a scar
on the back of his right hand.

53:07.125 --> 53:09.208
He might give you--

53:16.541 --> 53:18.583
Breathe!

53:39.958 --> 53:40.958
Professor,

53:42.833 --> 53:44.875
this is difficult, but very important.

53:46.916 --> 53:48.666
Why did White come to your room?

53:52.708 --> 53:55.541
-Did he tell you anything?
-No.

53:55.625 --> 53:59.833
-No. This place might be bugged.
-No. This room is clean.

53:59.916 --> 54:03.125
We checked it.
And the Soviets know everything anyway

54:03.208 --> 54:06.500
-since they're the ones who did this.
-How could they do this?

54:06.583 --> 54:09.333
It’s just a game.
He didn't even see it coming.

54:09.416 --> 54:12.875
I'm gonna call agent Novak
and we'll decide what to do next.

54:14.500 --> 54:17.791
I won't leave you for a second
while you're in the game. Alright?

54:18.958 --> 54:22.666
-We're gonna have to leave in 30 minutes.
-No. I'm not going anywhere!

54:22.750 --> 54:25.916
They're psychopaths. Murderers.
They're going to kill all of us.

54:26.000 --> 54:28.291
That kid. He was a human being.

54:28.375 --> 54:30.166
They killed a human being.

54:30.250 --> 54:33.833
I am gonna go to the press.
I'll go and tell them everything.

54:33.916 --> 54:36.666
-When they hear me...
-That’s enough.

54:40.166 --> 54:41.958
I'm going to buy us some time.

54:42.708 --> 54:44.541
I'm just going to buy us some time.

54:45.166 --> 54:48.500
<i>We'll transport you to the embassy</i>
<i>and we're going to say</i>

54:48.583 --> 54:50.208
<i>that you're not feeling well.</i>

54:51.291 --> 54:52.375
You're safe.

54:53.125 --> 54:54.291
You're safe.

54:57.958 --> 55:01.958
Professor Mansky is under medical
observation at the U.S. Embassy.

55:02.041 --> 55:05.791
<i>Cancelling this game will not</i>
<i>affect the rest of the tournament.</i>

55:07.041 --> 55:09.583
Andrey Savchuk,
“Komsomolskie Vremia.”

55:09.666 --> 55:13.208
<i>Are his heart tremors</i>
<i>possibly caused by alcohol?</i>

55:13.291 --> 55:15.000
I think we've reached a level

55:15.083 --> 55:18.458
<i>of conversation that would dictate</i>
<i>the end of this conference.</i>

55:18.541 --> 55:20.875
We will see the next game
as posted in the schedule.

55:34.041 --> 55:35.250
Christ.

55:37.333 --> 55:40.041
When do you plan to tell me
what is really going on?

55:45.833 --> 55:47.791
Konigsberg died in the same way he did.

55:49.666 --> 55:50.916
He was poisoned.

55:52.916 --> 55:53.916
They used ricin.

55:55.250 --> 55:56.958
That’s what the Soviets use.

55:59.958 --> 56:01.333
That's not an answer.

56:16.083 --> 56:19.208
Three weeks ago, our surveillance
discovered Soviet silos

56:19.291 --> 56:21.541
with fully operational missiles in Cuba.

56:21.625 --> 56:24.333
Do they have nuclear warheads?
That's the question.

56:24.875 --> 56:28.666
One of our analysts noticed
that these hips were too small

56:28.750 --> 56:31.875
to carry nuclear warheads.
But at this point, that’s just a theory.

56:31.958 --> 56:34.166
We don't know
the dimension of the warheads.

56:34.833 --> 56:37.083
We don't know
if they already have nukes in Cuba.

56:37.166 --> 56:39.375
But we're pretty sure
they're on their way.

56:39.458 --> 56:42.875
In fact, another Soviet convoy
is set to dock within a matter of hours.

56:42.958 --> 56:46.041
Surveillance photos revealed
that the ships are larger

56:46.125 --> 56:48.125
-and are carrying radioactive cargo.
-No.

56:49.166 --> 56:52.166
Don't please. Don't brief me.

56:52.250 --> 56:53.791
I don't want to hear about it.

56:53.875 --> 56:57.041
We can't predict what will happen
if we turn back that convoy,

56:57.125 --> 57:00.000
but if the Soviets already have
nukes in Cuba

57:00.083 --> 57:02.708
and want to make a strike,
the East Coast will be hit in minutes.

57:02.791 --> 57:04.500
Ninety million people will die.

57:04.583 --> 57:07.000
We have less than 36 hours
before they dock.

57:07.083 --> 57:08.541
Well, I'm sorry about that.

57:12.958 --> 57:15.166
John Gift. You know John Gift?

57:15.250 --> 57:17.833
No. We're here because of John Gift.

57:18.750 --> 57:22.541
That’s his code name.
He is a high-ranking Soviet officer

57:23.208 --> 57:27.666
who is involved in dealings
with the countries in the Warsaw Pact.

57:27.750 --> 57:30.291
Over the past year he's risked his life

57:30.375 --> 57:33.166
putting thousands of pages
of documents into our hands.

57:33.250 --> 57:36.041
He was going to deliver
the blueprints with the warheads

57:36.125 --> 57:38.333
to our guys in Moscow,
but there was a sting.

57:38.416 --> 57:40.166
Gift almost got caught.

57:40.250 --> 57:42.791
We moved the game to Warsaw
using diplomatic means,

57:42.875 --> 57:45.708
knowing Gift would be here
for the Warsaw Pact conference.

57:45.791 --> 57:47.958
White was the only one
to have contact with Gift.

57:52.958 --> 57:54.250
Now I understand.

57:54.875 --> 57:57.083
Someone in your operation is a rat.

57:57.166 --> 57:58.500
Gift knows this.

57:59.166 --> 58:01.000
After there was that sting.

58:01.666 --> 58:05.291
I'm the only one that Gift can be certain
wasn't planted by the Russians.

58:05.375 --> 58:08.875
Correct, professor.
So we need three things:

58:09.375 --> 58:13.375
ID Gift, establish contact with him,
and get us the microfilm.

58:15.875 --> 58:18.625
-That’s not going to happen.
-This is how it could work.

58:18.708 --> 58:19.833
We will back you up.

58:20.416 --> 58:24.291
We pass Gift coded messages
to make contact during the party

58:24.375 --> 58:26.958
hosted by the Russians
after the next match.

58:27.041 --> 58:29.875
He will give you the microfilm
in a champagne cork.

58:36.041 --> 58:37.041
I know what you want.

58:38.708 --> 58:40.625
Gavrylov can't lose the next game.

58:41.833 --> 58:44.041
-At least, it has to be a draw.
-Why?

58:44.125 --> 58:47.458
So that the Russians show up
at that mixer party thing afterwards.

58:49.708 --> 58:51.291
So can you make it a draw?

59:24.708 --> 59:27.875
Stepan Alekseyevich,
nothing will stand in our way.

59:28.500 --> 59:30.708
We have eliminated the American contact.

59:30.791 --> 59:32.916
We're closing in on our traitor.

59:33.666 --> 59:37.750
Our plan is moving flawlessly ahead.

59:37.833 --> 59:42.291
On the chessboard and beyond it.

59:43.625 --> 59:44.458
Yes...

59:45.000 --> 59:49.000
Soon, they'll be eating
out of our hands on their knees.

59:49.541 --> 59:54.083
Wait! It was not to you,
Stepan Alekseyevich.

59:57.833 --> 1:00:01.875
And thank you
for the wonderful gift from Havana.

1:00:03.958 --> 1:00:07.041
I'm enjoying them.

1:00:07.958 --> 1:00:09.958
Fine. Goodbye.

1:00:13.208 --> 1:00:15.875
You were instructed not to interrupt...

1:00:15.958 --> 1:00:18.541
Please accept my apologies.

1:00:19.166 --> 1:00:20.666
-The Americans...
-Attention!

1:00:21.291 --> 1:00:22.958
Three steps forward!

1:00:25.916 --> 1:00:27.750
Oh, so you can hear when spoken to!

1:00:30.625 --> 1:00:33.958
I've just finished this American book
about post-war history.

1:00:34.041 --> 1:00:35.625
They write a lot about us.

1:00:37.416 --> 1:00:40.208
And we're always shown as goons

1:00:40.666 --> 1:00:43.416
that mindlessly follow orders
or do what we're told

1:00:43.916 --> 1:00:45.583
by bloodthirsty psychopaths.

1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:51.333
Give me your hand.

1:00:54.375 --> 1:00:56.208
America is based on one big lie.

1:00:58.083 --> 1:01:00.333
That lie is called "democracy".

1:01:01.500 --> 1:01:04.833
A rich man has the right to everything,
while the worker has nothing.

1:01:04.916 --> 1:01:06.583
They treat women like servants

1:01:06.666 --> 1:01:09.083
and won't let a black man
use the same shitter.

1:01:09.666 --> 1:01:12.833
They spread "democracy" to nations

1:01:12.916 --> 1:01:15.208
that give away their riches for pennies.

1:01:16.458 --> 1:01:19.625
But if those countries nationalize
their mines and factories,

1:01:19.708 --> 1:01:23.666
the Americans send their armies
to protect "democracy".

1:01:28.250 --> 1:01:30.291
We believe in the value of a man,

1:01:32.791 --> 1:01:34.875
while they only care about his price.

1:01:35.958 --> 1:01:37.833
We will never understand each other.

1:01:46.250 --> 1:01:47.083
So?

1:01:52.083 --> 1:01:53.625
What do you think I should do?

1:02:11.666 --> 1:02:13.791
We couldn't do this without you,
professor.

1:02:16.666 --> 1:02:19.750
-There’s still hope.
-I've heard that before.

1:02:24.541 --> 1:02:28.083
Towards the end of the war,
a friend of mine from college

1:02:28.916 --> 1:02:30.333
came into my classroom.

1:02:30.416 --> 1:02:32.958
He was a physicist
and needed help with a problem.

1:02:33.291 --> 1:02:36.916
I found a mistake in his calculations.
I wrote a new equation

1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:39.416
and he said it made his project possible.

1:02:42.416 --> 1:02:44.041
This was Robert Oppenheimer.

1:02:46.416 --> 1:02:50.208
He said, "Why don't you
come to Los Alamos.

1:02:51.458 --> 1:02:52.708
You can help.

1:02:53.916 --> 1:02:56.833
It’s our best hope.
We can't do it without you."

1:03:00.375 --> 1:03:02.125
And when we saw what we did...

1:03:04.250 --> 1:03:07.791
A flash, warm breeze,
everything in flames,

1:03:07.875 --> 1:03:09.541
sucked into a mushroom cloud.

1:03:11.708 --> 1:03:12.708
Hiroshima.

1:03:15.083 --> 1:03:16.083
Nagasaki.

1:03:20.333 --> 1:03:22.250
Nothing made sense anymore.

1:03:25.666 --> 1:03:26.500
Chess,

1:03:27.583 --> 1:03:28.666
Konigsberg,

1:03:30.916 --> 1:03:32.083
nothing.

1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:39.916
Hope...

1:03:45.708 --> 1:03:49.125
So you brought me here
and I'm going to play chess

1:03:49.208 --> 1:03:50.916
because I know how to do it,

1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:53.708
and I'm playing my own game.

1:03:57.541 --> 1:03:59.125
That’s it, that’s all.

1:04:23.041 --> 1:04:26.541
<i>♪ You have your secret life</i>
<i>under your sweetest lie ♪</i>

1:04:26.625 --> 1:04:29.333

<i>♪ In that secret game ♪</i>

1:05:15.708 --> 1:05:17.500
Professor, it’s time.

1:06:51.708 --> 1:06:53.625
Bravo!

1:06:53.708 --> 1:06:58.000
Now it's time for a 15-minute break.

1:07:01.333 --> 1:07:03.833
Did you consider
the Queen’s Gambit, professor?

1:07:32.916 --> 1:07:35.375
That's...

1:07:42.916 --> 1:07:43.916
That's...

1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:45.791
-  You're the guy.
-Take it.

1:08:06.083 --> 1:08:07.708
It’s him.

1:08:11.833 --> 1:08:14.791
-Where is it?
-I got it here.

1:08:16.708 --> 1:08:18.333
I got to go. You take it.

1:08:18.416 --> 1:08:21.083
-Keep it. We have to go.
-You need it.

1:08:22.833 --> 1:08:23.666
Hey!

1:08:57.916 --> 1:09:02.250
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the second part of today's game.

1:09:59.791 --> 1:10:01.125
Judge, please.

1:10:08.125 --> 1:10:08.958
Yes?

1:10:11.833 --> 1:10:15.541
I would like to propose a draw
to grand master Gavrylov.

1:10:16.416 --> 1:10:18.583
- Professor Mansky...
- I understand.

1:10:21.041 --> 1:10:24.750
The situation on the chessboard is clear.
Let’s not joke.

1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:31.500
- No.
-Please continue.

1:11:31.666 --> 1:11:33.000
Judge, please.

1:11:39.791 --> 1:11:43.125
I would like to propose a draw.

1:11:44.208 --> 1:11:45.625
Grand master Gavrylov...

1:11:58.875 --> 1:12:01.500
Ladies and gentlemen, it's a draw!

1:12:12.708 --> 1:12:13.958
Professor,

1:12:14.875 --> 1:12:18.083
-the Russians are waiting to start.
-I have to go to the embassy.

1:12:19.166 --> 1:12:20.750
Didn't Miss Stone tell you?

1:12:20.833 --> 1:12:23.583
Something happened out there
and we've been quarantined.

1:12:23.666 --> 1:12:26.333
We can't leave the palace until tomorrow.

1:12:27.041 --> 1:12:28.458
They've locked us in.

1:12:28.958 --> 1:12:30.041
So...

1:12:31.208 --> 1:12:32.458
Shall we?

1:12:47.125 --> 1:12:48.541
Thank you, I am sorry.

1:12:48.625 --> 1:12:50.166
Excuse me sir. Thank you.

1:12:56.583 --> 1:12:57.583
Excuse me.

1:12:57.958 --> 1:13:01.041
Unfortunately, professor Mansky
is unable to attend the mixer.

1:13:01.125 --> 1:13:03.583
-Would you translate?
- Unfortunately,

1:13:03.666 --> 1:13:06.166
professor Mansky is unable
to attend the mixer.

1:13:08.333 --> 1:13:11.041
Congratulations
to our wonderful players.

1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:15.458
We are happy that chess won over politics.

1:13:16.041 --> 1:13:19.041
Tomorrow’s game
will decide the champion.

1:13:19.750 --> 1:13:23.958
Let the best man win
and long live peace between our nations.

1:13:33.916 --> 1:13:37.375
In Poland,
we never forget about friends.

1:13:40.250 --> 1:13:42.541
Please. It's bad. I need some assistance.

1:13:51.250 --> 1:13:52.083
What?

1:13:53.041 --> 1:13:57.250
I need to make contact
with someone outside.

1:13:58.583 --> 1:14:00.083
How can I help?

1:14:01.416 --> 1:14:02.750
Can you take me?

1:14:04.625 --> 1:14:06.916
-Now?
-Yeah.

1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:09.416
I can't.

1:14:10.208 --> 1:14:14.500
I have to go back to the party
with Krutov and prime minister come.

1:14:15.083 --> 1:14:16.083
Please.

1:14:18.416 --> 1:14:20.291
It’s bad.

1:14:29.291 --> 1:14:31.083
This little red book

1:14:32.083 --> 1:14:34.458
opens every door in this country.

1:14:38.125 --> 1:14:39.041
Go.

1:14:45.208 --> 1:14:47.125
If they catch you...

1:14:49.458 --> 1:14:50.291
Yeah.

1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:45.958
<i>No-one is certain how many of them</i>
<i>are headed for Cuba</i>

1:15:46.041 --> 1:15:48.166
<i>with cargoes of prohibited weapons.</i>

1:15:48.250 --> 1:15:51.458
<i>All that is sure is that</i>
<i>within 24 hours a confrontation</i>

1:15:51.541 --> 1:15:54.500
<i>between the searching forces</i>
<i>of the United States</i>

1:15:55.000 --> 1:15:57.916
<i>and the Soviet missile heading for Cuba</i>
<i>must take place.</i>

1:15:59.958 --> 1:16:01.750
<i>The world awaits the outcome.</i>

1:16:05.416 --> 1:16:07.750
-He came alone? Where’s Stone?
-I don’t know.

1:16:07.833 --> 1:16:11.250
Mansky snuck on to the premises
when the laundry truck arrived.

1:16:13.125 --> 1:16:14.583
Go to the boiler room.

1:16:15.000 --> 1:16:17.791
Make sure they burn every file
with an orange stripe on it.

1:16:24.291 --> 1:16:27.208
- What happened?
-Stone is dead.

1:16:33.000 --> 1:16:35.500
This guy in a suit tracked me down

1:16:37.666 --> 1:16:39.291
and he gave me this cork.

1:16:40.041 --> 1:16:42.875
Then Stone came. She wouldn't take it.

1:16:44.458 --> 1:16:47.041
All of a sudden,
they're both down on the ground.

1:16:48.083 --> 1:16:50.416
<i>This guy in a Soviet uniform.</i>

1:16:52.041 --> 1:16:55.250
<i>I thought he was going to...</i>
<i>I was waiting for him to kill me.</i>

1:16:59.625 --> 1:17:02.416
<i>He found this needle on Stone.</i>

1:17:10.708 --> 1:17:12.875
She prepared last vodka for you.

1:17:14.208 --> 1:17:15.833
She was going to use it on me.

1:17:25.291 --> 1:17:26.916
And then he gave me this.

1:17:35.083 --> 1:17:38.458
Remember. Bad one, good one.

1:17:42.250 --> 1:17:43.416
-Okay.

1:17:44.166 --> 1:17:45.833
Rakirovka. Tell them.

1:17:45.916 --> 1:17:47.000
<i> Rakirovka.</i>

1:17:48.708 --> 1:17:50.291
He killed two people.

1:17:50.375 --> 1:17:52.250
I think he saved my life.

1:17:52.916 --> 1:17:55.375
I've got to figure out
whether Stone was a traitor

1:17:55.458 --> 1:17:58.166
or a hero who died for God and Country.

1:17:58.250 --> 1:18:02.083
And I've got four hours to determine
whether or not to tell the government

1:18:02.166 --> 1:18:03.833
to order a blockade of Cuba.

1:18:04.541 --> 1:18:05.916
White, before he died,

1:18:06.000 --> 1:18:08.541
he must have not trusted you,
because he told me

1:18:09.333 --> 1:18:11.500
that Gift would have a scar
on his right hand.

1:18:11.583 --> 1:18:14.666
It made me wonder about you two.
I guess I was half right.

1:18:15.750 --> 1:18:17.750
She's the one who thought of Warsaw,

1:18:17.833 --> 1:18:20.000
and this plan of using me as a contact?

1:18:23.250 --> 1:18:25.833
If Stone was a traitor,
the Soviets know too much.

1:18:25.916 --> 1:18:28.750
-We have to evacuate the embassy.
-If she was a traitor,

1:18:29.541 --> 1:18:32.708
that means you guys are
ahead of the Soviets for the first time.

1:19:16.041 --> 1:19:17.333
Where?

1:19:18.500 --> 1:19:21.500
I'll be there in five minutes.
Don't touch anything.

1:19:34.750 --> 1:19:35.833
We're ready.

1:19:39.416 --> 1:19:41.666
Okay. It's just like you said.

1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:44.125
One film from the cork with Stone’s blood

1:19:44.208 --> 1:19:46.833
shows that the Cubans have the nukes
aimed and ready.

1:19:46.916 --> 1:19:50.750
The other says the Soviets are bluffing.
Washington wants you on the line.

1:19:59.166 --> 1:20:00.375
Holy shit.

1:20:00.458 --> 1:20:03.708
This is President Kennedy. Stop.

1:20:03.791 --> 1:20:06.833
Stop. Do you trust the man
who killed our agent, question mark.

1:20:06.916 --> 1:20:08.916
Maybe it’s a ruse, question mark.

1:20:09.000 --> 1:20:11.375
Their agent might have eliminated
Gift and Stone,

1:20:11.458 --> 1:20:13.375
and given you the wrong film. Break.

1:20:17.208 --> 1:20:20.125
He reads your lips
and sends the messages to Washington.

1:20:20.208 --> 1:20:22.000
You’ve seen how they reply. Just...

1:20:23.750 --> 1:20:24.875
speak clearly.

1:20:29.375 --> 1:20:31.291
And say "break" when you're done.

1:20:33.875 --> 1:20:36.458
There's the riddle about two brothers.

1:20:36.541 --> 1:20:39.125
One always lies,
the other always tells the truth.

1:20:42.625 --> 1:20:46.791
You meet them at a fork in the road
and ask one of them how to get to town.

1:20:46.875 --> 1:20:48.166
The answer is,

1:20:48.833 --> 1:20:50.250
you ask one of them

1:20:50.583 --> 1:20:53.791
what road the other brother
would suggest you take

1:20:53.875 --> 1:20:56.000
and then you take the opposite.

1:21:00.833 --> 1:21:02.291
The algorithm is very similar.

1:21:02.375 --> 1:21:04.000
If that were the case,

1:21:04.791 --> 1:21:07.250
they would have taken
the path of least resistance

1:21:08.458 --> 1:21:10.208
and eliminated me.

1:21:10.291 --> 1:21:13.000
They've already got
everything they want.

1:21:13.083 --> 1:21:16.333
They have their traitor dead,
a U.S. agent eliminated,

1:21:16.416 --> 1:21:19.000
they have ships in Cuba,

1:21:19.083 --> 1:21:21.000
and they have a chess victory.

1:21:26.000 --> 1:21:27.708
That man was Gift.

1:21:27.791 --> 1:21:29.625
I think he saved my life.

1:21:31.833 --> 1:21:32.750
Break.

1:21:47.875 --> 1:21:49.791
Godspeed, gentlemen. Stop.

1:21:50.291 --> 1:21:51.791
End of transmission.

1:21:52.916 --> 1:21:54.500
He’s still thinking it over.

1:21:54.583 --> 1:21:57.833
I think he’s going to make his play
right before the clock runs out.

1:21:58.333 --> 1:21:59.791
Let's just hope he’s right.

1:22:04.416 --> 1:22:05.875
Wait. Where's everybody?

1:22:06.375 --> 1:22:09.375
We have orders to keep everyone
in the embassy’s bomb shelter

1:22:09.458 --> 1:22:11.375
until two hours after Kennedy’s speech.

1:22:11.458 --> 1:22:14.083
-That means if we get hit...
-It’ll be one of ours.

1:22:16.958 --> 1:22:18.958
<i>Good evening, my fellow citizens.</i>

1:22:19.750 --> 1:22:21.666
<i>This Government, as promised,</i>

1:22:22.625 --> 1:22:25.125
<i>has maintained the closest surveillance</i>

1:22:25.708 --> 1:22:29.166
<i>of the Soviet Military buildup</i>
<i>on the island of Cuba.</i>

1:22:29.666 --> 1:22:32.291
<i>Acting, therefore,</i>
<i>in the defense of our own security</i>

1:22:33.083 --> 1:22:35.000
<i>and of the entire Western Hemisphere,</i>

1:22:36.083 --> 1:22:39.000
<i>and under the authority</i>
<i>entrusted to me by the Constitution</i>

1:22:39.791 --> 1:22:42.041
<i>as endorsed</i>
<i>by the resolution of the Congress,</i>

1:22:43.125 --> 1:22:47.000
<i>I have directed that the following</i>
<i>initial steps be taken immediately.</i>

1:22:48.166 --> 1:22:51.541
<i>First: to halt this offensive buildup,</i>

1:22:52.125 --> 1:22:55.416
<i>a strict quarantine</i>
<i>on all offensive military equipment</i>

1:22:55.500 --> 1:22:58.000
<i>under shipment to Cuba is being initiated.</i>

1:22:58.708 --> 1:23:01.000
<i>All ships of any kind bound for Cuba,</i>

1:23:01.708 --> 1:23:03.458
<i>from whatever nation or port,</i>

1:23:03.541 --> 1:23:06.458
<i>will, if found to contain cargoes</i>
<i>of offensive weapons,</i>

1:23:06.541 --> 1:23:08.125
<i>-be turned back.</i>

1:23:22.583 --> 1:23:25.000
-Congratulations.
-I don’t know why.

1:23:25.083 --> 1:23:26.208
And thank you.

1:23:26.833 --> 1:23:29.833
Don't thank me. It's him. It's Gift.

1:23:31.333 --> 1:23:32.958
Whatever his name is.

1:23:55.208 --> 1:23:58.500
So, what did he mean by "rakirovka"?
What did this mean?

1:23:59.000 --> 1:24:01.750
That means "castling", why?

1:24:01.833 --> 1:24:03.666
I already told you.

1:24:05.083 --> 1:24:07.500
Gift wanted you to know that.

1:24:08.750 --> 1:24:11.250
-He told you that?
-Yeah.

1:24:13.375 --> 1:24:14.958
Means imminent danger.

1:24:19.875 --> 1:24:22.333
General Major,
the leadership called.

1:24:23.083 --> 1:24:24.916
Kennedy announced a blockade of Cuba.

1:24:30.666 --> 1:24:33.791
Defeat is not defeat
if we share it with the enemy.

1:24:35.416 --> 1:24:37.916
Get me a list of the officers
of the Warsaw Pact

1:24:38.000 --> 1:24:41.208
who came to this match
but were not present at the party.

1:24:42.250 --> 1:24:44.458
And have the director pay me a visit.

1:25:01.041 --> 1:25:03.625
You know, usually women flip
for love or conviction,

1:25:03.708 --> 1:25:05.666
but with Stone I just can't figure it.

1:25:05.750 --> 1:25:07.958
Whatever it was,
she surely was impressive.

1:25:08.041 --> 1:25:12.333
All that crying over White,
thinking up that stand for Gift,

1:25:12.416 --> 1:25:15.208
and if that syringe
with vodka thing had worked,

1:25:15.291 --> 1:25:17.166
you’d have found me after the party

1:25:17.250 --> 1:25:19.541
dead with all those blueprints
in my pocket.

1:25:20.958 --> 1:25:21.875
We have a tail.

1:25:24.250 --> 1:25:25.625
You're sure about this?

1:25:27.750 --> 1:25:30.416
This isn't a job I like to give
to a civilian.

1:25:31.208 --> 1:25:33.541
We'll have 10 seconds
before they catch up.

1:25:33.625 --> 1:25:34.708
I’ll pray for you.

1:25:35.375 --> 1:25:37.875
Whatever you do,
circle back for me tomorrow night.

1:25:37.958 --> 1:25:39.250
That'll be enough.

1:26:07.375 --> 1:26:10.375
Straight from Havana. I like them a lot.

1:26:14.166 --> 1:26:18.666
Even if you like the taste,
you shouldn't inhale.

1:26:22.666 --> 1:26:25.208
Well, I inhale.

1:26:27.625 --> 1:26:30.250
Personally, I am against violence,

1:26:33.083 --> 1:26:36.083
but our youth today is so impetuous.

1:26:41.000 --> 1:26:42.625
-Come in!

1:26:57.000 --> 1:26:59.625
The radio emitted this two hours ago.

1:26:59.708 --> 1:27:01.458
We were able to crack the code.

1:27:08.666 --> 1:27:10.083
You, Poles...

1:27:11.750 --> 1:27:13.625
Reaching out to the West,

1:27:14.375 --> 1:27:16.125
trying to stab us in the back.

1:27:16.833 --> 1:27:18.666
But the West betrays you

1:27:18.750 --> 1:27:21.083
and sells you out to us.

1:27:22.041 --> 1:27:25.958
Because they know we're big and strong,
while you're small and weak.

1:27:26.750 --> 1:27:28.333
Plus, you're similar to us.

1:27:30.750 --> 1:27:32.416
I know everything about you.

1:27:33.000 --> 1:27:34.875
I know your sister defected to America,

1:27:34.958 --> 1:27:37.250
and that you've hidden dollars
in your house,

1:27:37.333 --> 1:27:41.500
dreaming of the day you can leave
our Socialist paradise.

1:27:41.583 --> 1:27:45.333
I even know that you put Mansky
in a room with a secret entrance.

1:27:51.875 --> 1:27:52.833
Tell me...

1:27:54.541 --> 1:27:55.833
something I don't know.

1:28:00.666 --> 1:28:02.666
Hospitality runs in our blood.

1:28:06.041 --> 1:28:08.416
Yes. The vodka's starting to work.

1:28:09.916 --> 1:28:12.875
That Mansky, a pal of yours. He's strange.

1:28:12.958 --> 1:28:13.958
A loner.

1:28:15.250 --> 1:28:16.750
The Americans lack morals.

1:28:18.208 --> 1:28:19.916
Maybe he doesn't only suck bottles?

1:28:23.291 --> 1:28:24.708
No.

1:28:26.833 --> 1:28:28.916
When we were at the bar...

1:28:35.333 --> 1:28:36.666
"The bar", you say?

1:28:41.708 --> 1:28:44.583
Ladies and gentlemen,
in 15 minutes,

1:28:44.666 --> 1:28:48.583
we will begin the final game
of the match which will be broadcast live.

1:28:48.666 --> 1:28:50.000
Tonight,

1:28:50.083 --> 1:28:52.791
we have the pleasure of welcoming
some distinguished guests.

1:28:52.875 --> 1:28:55.750
Commander-in-Chief
of the Warsaw Pact, Marshal Grechko,

1:28:58.083 --> 1:29:02.500
and Prime Minister, comrade Cyrankiewicz!

1:29:02.583 --> 1:29:06.041
Long live the friendship
between Poland and the U.S.S.R.!

1:29:06.125 --> 1:29:09.291
Long live!

1:29:10.833 --> 1:29:12.041
You are wonderful!

1:29:12.125 --> 1:29:14.041
Professor, a word...

1:29:14.916 --> 1:29:18.208
I just wanted to say
that watching you this whole match...

1:29:18.291 --> 1:29:21.958
Your play and your genius
have my total respect.

1:29:22.041 --> 1:29:25.250
And listen, I've never told you this,

1:29:25.916 --> 1:29:28.500
but I was there 17 years ago.

1:29:29.041 --> 1:29:31.375
Your championship game with Konigsberg.

1:29:32.375 --> 1:29:34.208
But the reason I’m telling you this

1:29:34.291 --> 1:29:37.500
is because we see
a totally different man before us

1:29:38.416 --> 1:29:40.166
now, today.

1:30:32.750 --> 1:30:34.541
Come out, whore.

1:30:56.833 --> 1:30:58.166
Give me your gun!

1:31:16.625 --> 1:31:20.541
Go back
where you came from, rat.

1:31:21.583 --> 1:31:25.750
This is an illegal arrest
of an American citizen

1:31:25.833 --> 1:31:28.375
who was guaranteed immunity

1:31:28.458 --> 1:31:32.416
-by First Secretary Khrushchev.
- Shut up!

1:31:43.708 --> 1:31:45.375
From this moment,

1:31:46.125 --> 1:31:47.458
you can be afraid

1:31:48.916 --> 1:31:52.250
until the rest of your short life.

1:31:56.500 --> 1:31:58.083
I will find you.

1:31:59.291 --> 1:32:02.500
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>and everyone present here,</i>

1:32:02.583 --> 1:32:06.250
<i>at the Palace of Culture and Science,</i>
<i>the pride of our great capital city.</i>

1:32:06.333 --> 1:32:09.625
<i>I regret to announce</i>
<i>that the representative of the USA,</i>

1:32:09.708 --> 1:32:12.166
<i>Professor Mansky, has failed to appear,</i>

1:32:12.250 --> 1:32:15.958
<i>meaning he has forfeited the final game.</i>

1:32:16.041 --> 1:32:18.083
Therefore,

1:32:18.166 --> 1:32:21.000
the winner of the chess tournament

1:32:21.083 --> 1:32:24.416
is Yuri Siergeyevich Gavrylov!

1:32:24.500 --> 1:32:27.625
-Bravo!

1:32:29.333 --> 1:32:32.541
Looks like you lost another championship.

1:32:41.125 --> 1:32:44.083
Bravo!

1:32:53.041 --> 1:32:54.833
We will be landing in few minutes.

1:32:57.000 --> 1:32:58.500
Has anyone told his wife?

1:33:01.041 --> 1:33:02.958
She didn’t even know he was in Poland.

1:33:03.625 --> 1:33:04.791
Nobody knew.

1:33:06.708 --> 1:33:07.958
I got a lot of work ahead.

1:33:13.791 --> 1:33:16.041
Here he comes. Mr. Mansky!

1:33:16.125 --> 1:33:18.041
Did you have a nervous breakdown?

1:33:18.125 --> 1:33:20.291
How does it feel
to have humiliated the U.S.

1:33:20.375 --> 1:33:24.041
while a pilot patrolling Cuba
heroically gave his life for his country?

1:33:24.125 --> 1:33:26.375
Don’t worry about it.
Leave him alone.

1:33:26.458 --> 1:33:29.750
Was it the booze?!
Do you consider yourself a patriot?!

1:33:43.875 --> 1:33:45.458
So, what happens now?

1:33:47.166 --> 1:33:50.458
In our book you're a citizen hero.
You’ll be taken care of.

1:33:51.375 --> 1:33:53.000
We still do that pretty good.

1:33:54.125 --> 1:33:56.875
We'll put on a show at the UN,
call it a crisis,

1:33:56.958 --> 1:34:00.791
feed the press some red meat about
how those missiles were almost in the air.

1:34:01.833 --> 1:34:03.625
No one will know the difference.

1:34:05.875 --> 1:34:07.958
No one will know what really happened.

1:34:22.666 --> 1:34:23.791
Wait here, please.

1:34:24.208 --> 1:34:25.541
Oh, I almost forgot.

1:34:28.291 --> 1:34:29.541
Welcome home.

1:34:46.125 --> 1:34:47.375
-Hey.

1:34:54.708 --> 1:34:56.500
-You've made it.
-Yes.

1:34:57.791 --> 1:34:58.708
I...

1:35:00.750 --> 1:35:02.375
live thanks to you.

1:35:06.125 --> 1:35:08.166
Not so fortunate to your friend.

1:35:14.625 --> 1:35:18.291
Fredek... he took a big risk.

1:35:20.250 --> 1:35:21.166
He was...

1:35:27.500 --> 1:35:30.041
I’ll always think of him. Always.

1:35:30.791 --> 1:35:32.500
It was the only way out.

1:35:32.750 --> 1:35:35.750
Remember,
I saw the order of attack, signed.

1:35:47.291 --> 1:35:48.833
It's a present from Novak.

1:35:49.833 --> 1:35:52.750
He wants to let us know
that he's going to take care of us.

1:35:57.541 --> 1:35:59.291
It's yours if you want it.

1:36:01.541 --> 1:36:03.333
I don't want to be taken care of.

1:36:49.083 --> 1:36:52.500
<i>The White House has announced</i>
<i>its withdrawal from the INF Treaty</i>

1:36:52.583 --> 1:36:55.666
<i>due to Russia's one-sided</i>
<i>violation of its provisions.</i>

1:36:57.083 --> 1:37:00.291
<i>President of the Russian</i>
<i>Federation, Vladimir Putin,</i>

1:37:00.375 --> 1:37:03.083
<i>announced that Russia</i>
<i>had also suspended the INF Treaty</i>

1:37:03.166 --> 1:37:05.083
<i>and will be taking similar steps.</i>
