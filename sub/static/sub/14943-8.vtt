was guilty of this murder?

09:42.152 --> 09:44.213
Didn't look that way last night.

09:44.214 --> 09:45.584
You saw me with Skylar?

09:45.585 --> 09:47.056
You came back to the bar?

09:47.057 --> 09:48.357
Yeah.

09:48.358 --> 09:49.889
(People speaking indistinctly)

09:49.890 --> 09:52.161
You don't know how
you got those scratches?

09:52.162 --> 09:54.263
What scratches?

09:54.264 --> 09:55.865
(Radio chatter continues)

09:55.866 --> 09:57.797
What's that?

09:57.798 --> 09:59.869
It looks like fingernail Polish.

09:59.870 --> 10:02.201
We'll know for sure
when the lab confirms it.

10:02.202 --> 10:04.033
Look, I didn't
have anything to do

10:04.034 --> 10:05.735
with what happened to Skylar.

10:05.736 --> 10:07.737
(Adam) No one said you did.

10:07.738 --> 10:09.378
But chief Martin wants
you back at the precinct.

10:09.379 --> 10:12.142
She just wants to get you
on record as soon as possible.

10:16.787 --> 10:18.617
(Lowered voice) What
the hell happened there?

10:18.618 --> 10:20.149
(Lowered voice) I don't know.

10:20.150 --> 10:23.122
But him being here, not
remembering, the scratches...

10:23.123 --> 10:24.854
It doesn't look good.

10:24.855 --> 10:26.956
Skylar green's
connection to Steve Owen

10:26.957 --> 10:28.658
is not a coincidence.

10:28.659 --> 10:30.800
Her murder has something
to do with this case.

10:30.801 --> 10:33.402
But what does that
have to do with Tommy?

10:33.403 --> 10:35.765
The sooner we
find out, the better,

10:35.766 --> 10:37.938
for all of us.

10:46.276 --> 10:49.078
(Power tools whirring)
Everybody loved her.

10:49.079 --> 10:50.649
(People speaking indistinctly)

10:50.650 --> 10:52.882
Skylar... (Hammering)

10:52.883 --> 10:55.054
I can't imagine who
would've done this.

10:55.055 --> 10:56.856
Just to be clear, my client
has been under house arrest

10:56.857 --> 10:58.257
since January.

10:58.258 --> 10:59.789
He's not a suspect
in her murder,

10:59.790 --> 11:01.090
but there may be a
connection to this case.

11:01.091 --> 11:02.431
Now we know that Skylar

11:02.432 --> 11:03.933
was looking for proof
that you were innocent.

11:03.934 --> 11:06.335
Is it possible that
she found something?

11:06.336 --> 11:08.968
I don't know. I hadn't
seen her in a while.

11:08.969 --> 11:10.439
You think that's
why she was killed?

11:10.440 --> 11:11.841
It's possible.

11:11.842 --> 11:13.302
(People continue
speaking indistinctly)

11:13.303 --> 11:15.004
You think she might have
talked to anybody else about this?

11:15.005 --> 11:18.107
Not that I can think of.

11:18.108 --> 11:20.249
Well...

11:20.250 --> 11:23.983
Except for detective
Sullivan, of course.

11:23.984 --> 11:25.314
What do you mean, of course?

11:25.315 --> 11:27.086
Oh, he was your
partner, wasn't he?

11:27.087 --> 11:28.988
Didn't he tell you about Skylar?

11:28.989 --> 11:31.320
Please just answer the question.

11:31.321 --> 11:34.193
Go ahead.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.825
(Sighs)

11:35.826 --> 11:38.027
Skylar was, uh,
infatuated with him.

11:38.028 --> 11:39.929
She texted him all the time.

11:39.930 --> 11:42.001
She even showed
up at his place once.

11:42.002 --> 11:43.172
Was this interest mutual?

11:43.173 --> 11:44.403
I don't think so.

11:44.404 --> 11:46.936
That's why Sullivan
was a challenge.

11:46.937 --> 11:49.138
Skylar wasn't used
to hearing "no."

11:49.139 --> 11:51.811
(Power tools continue whirring)

11:51.812 --> 11:53.813
(Footsteps approaching)

11:53.814 --> 11:55.144
(Megan) What do you have?

11:55.145 --> 11:57.818
Tommy Sullivan can
use some good news.

12:02.923 --> 12:04.323
What?

12:04.324 --> 12:07.356
Well, I-I found a-a
strand of hair in...

12:07.357 --> 12:10.059
Skylar's bed.

12:10.060 --> 12:11.400
The d.N.A. Profile

12:11.401 --> 12:13.332
is a match for Tommy.

12:13.333 --> 12:15.334
In her bed? Yeah.

12:15.335 --> 12:16.505
What else?

12:16.506 --> 12:18.067
I still need to
double-check the finding...

12:18.068 --> 12:20.739
Curtis.

12:20.740 --> 12:23.412
The foreign matter you
found in Tommy's scratches...

12:23.413 --> 12:25.875
It's fingernail Polish
like you thought.

12:25.876 --> 12:28.417
And it's an exact
match to Skylar green's.

12:28.418 --> 12:29.919
Doesn't mean he killed her.

12:29.920 --> 12:31.851
Yeah, but it means they
got in a pretty nasty fight.

12:31.852 --> 12:34.924
Or... she scratched
him in the course of...

12:34.925 --> 12:36.255
Another activity.

12:36.256 --> 12:37.426
Like?

12:37.427 --> 12:38.858
Oh, boy.

12:38.859 --> 12:40.389
Oh, right.

12:40.390 --> 12:41.760
Right.

12:41.761 --> 12:43.063
Let me see the
marks on her neck.

12:44.865 --> 12:46.936
Okay.

12:46.937 --> 12:48.167
Okay, um,

12:48.168 --> 12:51.170
you see these
patterned abrasions?

12:51.171 --> 12:53.943
They're 4 centimeters apart.

12:53.944 --> 12:55.945
We think she was
strangled by a belt.

12:55.946 --> 12:57.176
Probably a man's belt.

12:57.177 --> 12:58.407
(Clicks switch)

12:58.408 --> 12:59.979
(Curtis) Megan,

12:59.980 --> 13:01.981
neither one of us
want to ask this,

13:01.982 --> 13:04.553
but was Tommy missing
his belt when you found him?

13:04.554 --> 13:07.286
Detective Sullivan was
missing half his wardrobe

13:07.287 --> 13:09.088
when I found him.

13:09.089 --> 13:10.419
Keep looking.

13:10.420 --> 13:11.961
Let me know when
you find something

13:11.962 --> 13:13.263
that actually helps Tommy.

13:17.797 --> 13:20.229
You were found outside
the scene of the crime,

13:20.230 --> 13:24.003
seen carousing with the
victim the night before,

13:24.004 --> 13:26.305
and you're saying to me
that you, a professional,

13:26.306 --> 13:28.307
trained in observation,

13:28.308 --> 13:31.010
have no recollection
of any of this?

13:31.011 --> 13:33.883
Chief, I know it
sounds unlikely...

13:33.884 --> 13:34.914
You were at a bar.

13:34.915 --> 13:36.315
Was this a blackout
due to alcohol?

13:36.316 --> 13:38.047
No, I didn't drink that much.

13:38.048 --> 13:40.990
I'm under the assumption
that I was drugged.

13:40.991 --> 13:42.992
Well, I certainly hope
the blood work shows that,

13:42.993 --> 13:45.024
because if it doesn't,

13:45.025 --> 13:51.360
your lack of recall could
prove extremely damning.

13:51.361 --> 13:53.002
Am I understood?

13:53.003 --> 13:54.463
Yes, ma'am.

13:54.464 --> 13:57.006
God's honest, I'm telling
you everything I know.

13:57.007 --> 13:59.308
I did not kill Skylar green.

13:59.309 --> 14:02.011
As far as you can remember.

14:02.012 --> 14:03.873
Do not leave the precinct

14:03.874 --> 14:05.374
until I tell you otherwise.

14:05.375 --> 14:06.916
That's an order.

14:06.917 --> 14:08.078
Yes, ma'am.

14:12.082 --> 14:14.183
Chief, i'm, uh, Adam
Lucas. I'm Tommy's partner.

14:14.184 --> 14:15.524
I know who you are,

14:15.525 --> 14:16.986
and here's what
you need to know...

14:16.987 --> 14:18.988
You need to get this
resolved as soon as possible,

14:18.989 --> 14:20.890
for your partner, for you,

14:20.891 --> 14:23.232
and for the department.

14:23.233 --> 14:25.035
Right.

14:27.637 --> 14:29.638
What the hell was that about?

14:29.639 --> 14:32.301
(Exhales) She wants
to move this along,

14:32.302 --> 14:34.073
meaning she wants me to confess.

14:34.074 --> 14:35.644
Oh, well, right.

14:35.645 --> 14:37.476
It's good to know
she's got your back.

14:37.477 --> 14:39.079
With a bayonet.

14:40.650 --> 14:42.311
This looks kinda
bad, doesn't it?

14:42.312 --> 14:43.652
Yeah, well, it won't

14:43.653 --> 14:45.154
once we find out
what really happened.

14:45.155 --> 14:46.655
Now do you remember
anything about last night,

14:46.656 --> 14:48.057
even something little? (Clicks)

14:48.058 --> 14:49.388
(Sighs)

14:49.389 --> 14:52.021
Well, I've been
racking my brain.

14:52.022 --> 14:54.023
I can't think of anything
that happened to Skylar,

14:54.024 --> 14:56.165
but...

14:56.166 --> 14:58.667
Most bars have a
surveillance camera.

14:58.668 --> 15:00.499
Right. We checked
o'Connor's. They do.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.271
The tapes are on
their way. (Clicks pen)

15:02.272 --> 15:04.274
(People speak indistinctly)

15:06.176 --> 15:08.507
So this is you and Tommy

15:08.508 --> 15:11.611
before Skylar got there.
(Video playing without audio)

15:13.083 --> 15:16.946
"I remember us
making up like crazy,

15:16.947 --> 15:19.288
mind-blowing sex."

15:19.289 --> 15:20.649
"We were a lot younger then."

15:20.650 --> 15:22.121
Okay, fast-forward,
please. (Keyboard key clicks)

15:22.122 --> 15:23.692
(Whirs, keyboard key clicks)

15:23.693 --> 15:27.026
"Let's check into that hotel.

15:27.027 --> 15:28.227
Maybe we'll regret
it in the morning..."

15:28.228 --> 15:29.928
further. Further.
(Keyboard key clicks)

15:29.929 --> 15:31.000
(Whirs)

15:31.001 --> 15:32.562
(Keyboard key clicks)

15:34.034 --> 15:37.936
"You haven't returned
any of my calls."

15:37.937 --> 15:39.638
"You have to stop this, okay?

15:39.639 --> 15:42.571
You can't do this anymore."

15:42.572 --> 15:43.973
I can't read the whispering.

15:43.974 --> 15:45.244
"Just stop it, all right?"

15:45.245 --> 15:48.317
"I had to see you. I
had to see you tonight."

15:48.318 --> 15:51.720
"You don't... do not...
you... It has to end now."

15:51.721 --> 15:53.722
"You have to"... He
slurred the last words.

15:53.723 --> 15:57.956
"Just hear me out, please."

15:57.957 --> 15:59.628
"You're going to regret this."

15:59.629 --> 16:01.561
"Come on." Mm.

16:04.034 --> 16:06.335
Are you sure
that's what he said,

16:06.336 --> 16:07.636
"you're gonna regret this"?

16:07.637 --> 16:09.038
I'm very confident.

16:09.039 --> 16:11.340
I've been doing this
professionally for 20 years.

16:11.341 --> 16:13.342
Thank you, meryl.

16:13.343 --> 16:17.347
Thank you.

16:18.748 --> 16:20.249
(Lowered voice) So Steve
Owen said that Skylar

16:20.250 --> 16:21.680
wasn't just interested in Tommy,

16:21.681 --> 16:24.213
she was practically
stalking him.

16:24.214 --> 16:27.056
Right. So he was trying
to get her to back off.

16:27.057 --> 16:28.357
She won't. He has
too much to drink.

16:28.358 --> 16:30.019
He threatens her.
He gets violent?

16:30.020 --> 16:31.420
Believe me,

16:31.421 --> 16:33.592
Tommy knows lots of ways
to break up with women.

16:33.593 --> 16:35.994
Violence is not one of them.

16:35.995 --> 16:37.066
(Cell phone rings)

16:37.067 --> 16:39.198
Oh. (Beeps)

16:39.199 --> 16:40.499
Yeah?

16:40.500 --> 16:41.700
(Ethan) C.S.U. Techs

16:41.701 --> 16:43.402
found it hidden in the brush

16:43.403 --> 16:46.375
about 20 yards from where
you discovered Tommy.

16:46.376 --> 16:49.178
It was covered in
Skylar green's blood.

16:49.179 --> 16:51.180
Could you hold that
for me? Thank you.

16:51.181 --> 16:53.042
(Grunts)

16:53.043 --> 16:54.143
Now...

16:54.144 --> 16:55.484
(Clatters)

16:55.485 --> 16:57.587
Okay.

16:59.689 --> 17:01.191
Can I have this?

17:02.722 --> 17:05.023
As you can see,
the ligature marks

17:05.024 --> 17:06.325
match up perfectly.

17:06.326 --> 17:07.796
Let me see that.

17:07.797 --> 17:11.160
The belt had trace leather on it
that came from something else.

17:11.161 --> 17:13.031
We're working on it.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.433
(People speaking indistinctly)

17:14.434 --> 17:16.605
What are you not telling us?

17:16.606 --> 17:17.736
(Sighs) Yeah, well,

17:17.737 --> 17:20.539
we found epithelials
on the belt.

17:20.540 --> 17:23.073
And we have a d.N.A. Match.

17:24.414 --> 17:26.415
(Clicks keyboard keys)

17:26.416 --> 17:28.418
Tommy.

17:29.579 --> 17:31.220
(Camera shutter clicks)

17:31.221 --> 17:32.381
(Click)

17:32.382 --> 17:34.753
(Beeping)

17:34.754 --> 17:36.656
(Chirps)

17:44.834 --> 17:47.267
(Watch clatters on countertop)

17:48.738 --> 17:51.740
(Clicks)

17:51.741 --> 17:53.373
(Click)

18:17.167 --> 18:18.467
Skylar's friends say that
she was infatuated with you.

18:18.468 --> 18:19.828
Records show that she
sent you over a hundred texts

18:19.829 --> 18:21.370
since you first interviewed her.

18:21.371 --> 18:24.703
Tommy, we found
your hair in her bed.

18:24.704 --> 18:27.336
Okay, there was
no... Relationship.

18:27.337 --> 18:29.208
I wasn't sleeping with her.

18:29.209 --> 18:31.340
Then how did it get there?

18:31.341 --> 18:32.841
I don't know.

18:32.842 --> 18:35.514
We found Skylar's
fingernail Polish

18:35.515 --> 18:36.845
in your scratches.

18:36.846 --> 18:39.348
There is video

18:39.349 --> 18:41.450
of you apparently
threatening her.

18:41.451 --> 18:43.792
And your belt...

18:43.793 --> 18:46.325
Is the murder weapon.

18:46.326 --> 18:48.427
Somebody's doing this...

18:48.428 --> 18:50.159
Framing me.

18:50.160 --> 18:53.202
That's why they drugged me.

18:53.203 --> 18:55.164
What?

18:55.165 --> 18:57.707
Your blood work
came back normal.

19:00.510 --> 19:01.611
No drugs found.

19:05.275 --> 19:07.316
(Handcuffs clatter)

19:07.317 --> 19:10.780
I did not kill Skylar green!

19:16.256 --> 19:19.758
I didn't kill Skylar green.

19:19.759 --> 19:22.591
Tommy, we believe
you. We're your friends.

19:22.592 --> 19:24.593
We think that you
might have been framed.

19:24.594 --> 19:25.894
But we just can't prove it.

19:25.895 --> 19:27.366
Yet.

19:27.367 --> 19:28.867
So we need another
way of tackling it.

19:28.868 --> 19:30.699
Have you got another lead

19:30.700 --> 19:32.602
or anything?

19:34.344 --> 19:37.347
(People speaking indistinctly)

19:40.179 --> 19:41.950
Hello, chief Martin.

19:41.951 --> 19:43.552
What are you doing here?

19:43.553 --> 19:45.684
(Chuckles) As blunt
as always, Dr. Hunt.

19:45.685 --> 19:48.287
Chief Martin has come
to us as a courtesy

19:48.288 --> 19:50.519
with developments in the
detective Sullivan case.

19:50.520 --> 19:52.861
Have a seat, please.

19:52.862 --> 19:56.565
(Martin) You two work
closely with detective Sullivan.

19:56.566 --> 19:59.228
And you have an
understandable loyalty to him.

19:59.229 --> 20:01.900
But I'm here to tell you
that detective Sullivan

20:01.901 --> 20:03.872
may not be the man
that you think he is.

20:03.873 --> 20:05.574
Meaning what?

20:05.575 --> 20:08.277
We've determined that
after they left the bar,

20:08.278 --> 20:10.309
detective Sullivan
and the victim

20:10.310 --> 20:12.241
wound up at a nightclub...

20:12.242 --> 20:13.442
The red light.

20:13.443 --> 20:15.213
Right. That's one of
Steve Owen's clubs.

20:15.214 --> 20:17.215
We think that Skylar's murder

20:17.216 --> 20:19.217
may have something
to do with his case.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.250
We know this because
detective Sullivan

20:21.251 --> 20:24.853
got into a fight with
a bouncer at the club.

20:24.854 --> 20:26.955
The club has filed a complaint.

20:26.956 --> 20:28.297
The bouncer stated

20:28.298 --> 20:31.300
that the attack was
completely unprovoked,

20:31.301 --> 20:32.931
that Sullivan was
just belligerent,

20:32.932 --> 20:35.003
looking for violence.

20:35.004 --> 20:36.665
That's his side of the story.

20:36.666 --> 20:37.906
Of course he's
gonna blame Tommy.

20:37.907 --> 20:39.868
Yes, well, there's more.

20:39.869 --> 20:41.910
Because of the circumstances,

20:41.911 --> 20:46.345
the NYPD has agreed to
unseal confidential facts

20:46.346 --> 20:49.778
about detective Sullivan's file.

20:49.779 --> 20:51.019
His last year there,

20:51.020 --> 20:54.623
Sullivan chased down
and beat a suspect badly.

20:54.624 --> 20:56.885
That's why he left New York.

20:56.886 --> 20:58.657
(Kate) According to
the hospital records,

20:58.658 --> 21:00.929
the man was in intensive
care for over two months.

21:00.930 --> 21:03.562
This has no details
about the circumstances.

21:03.563 --> 21:05.764
It could be totally
out of context.

21:05.765 --> 21:07.265
We'll get the details.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.037
But the most overriding context

21:09.038 --> 21:10.899
is that detective Sullivan

21:10.900 --> 21:13.972
has a pathological
problem with control.

21:13.973 --> 21:15.474
Now from the beginning,

21:15.475 --> 21:17.346
neither of you should've
been on this case.

21:17.347 --> 21:18.807
You are not any longer.

21:18.808 --> 21:21.279
(Scoffs) I don't work for you.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.612
(Kate) I'm pulling you
at the chief's request.

21:23.613 --> 21:24.783
She's absolutely right.

21:24.784 --> 21:25.954
The police department
and this office

21:25.955 --> 21:27.316
have got to
maintain objectivity.

21:27.317 --> 21:29.658
Objectivity...

21:29.659 --> 21:31.320
Or appearances?

21:31.321 --> 21:32.861
(Martin) At this point,

21:32.862 --> 21:35.524
you will distance yourself
from detective Sullivan,

21:35.525 --> 21:37.025
you will not do or say anything

21:37.026 --> 21:38.997
that could further jeopardize
the case against him.

21:38.998 --> 21:41.970
Curtis is waiting to brief
us on Skylar's autopsy.

21:41.971 --> 21:43.972
We'll be back.

21:43.973 --> 21:46.335
That report doesn't
leave this office.

21:46.336 --> 21:47.906
This is your chance to read it.

21:47.907 --> 21:49.908
(Door opens)

21:49.909 --> 21:52.912
(People speaking indistinctly)

21:54.083 --> 21:56.386
(Sighs)

22:01.551 --> 22:04.423
(Exhales) I don't
know what to say.

22:04.424 --> 22:05.924
I don't know what to think.

22:05.925 --> 22:08.757
Tommy never told me about
what happened in New York.

22:08.758 --> 22:10.859
It's like you said, we don't
know the circumstances.

22:10.860 --> 22:13.832
I know. I just wish I
was more convinced.

22:13.833 --> 22:15.333
Megan, I've seen
it happen to cops...

22:15.334 --> 22:18.567
20, 30 years of
constant pressure,

22:18.568 --> 22:22.040
one day they just crack.

22:22.041 --> 22:24.513
(Sighs)

22:24.514 --> 22:25.844
(Pops)

22:25.845 --> 22:28.947
And we also matched
his belt to the murder.

22:28.948 --> 22:32.350
Well, based on the evidence,
if this case were in my court,

22:32.351 --> 22:34.022
we'd already be in sentencing.

22:34.023 --> 22:36.485
I know.

22:36.486 --> 22:37.886
But?

22:37.887 --> 22:40.058
But I keep telling
myself it's not Tommy.

22:40.059 --> 22:43.031
It's... he's not
capable of this.

22:43.032 --> 22:44.533
Well, you're not gonna
like what I have to say,

22:44.534 --> 22:45.964
but I never trusted him.

22:45.965 --> 22:47.566
You really do have a knack

22:47.567 --> 22:48.997
for saying the exact opposite
of what I want you to say.

22:48.998 --> 22:50.699
I am just being honest with you.

22:50.700 --> 22:52.040
Look at his background.

22:52.041 --> 22:53.371
What?

22:53.372 --> 22:55.043
He's a cop from a
broken family in queens.

22:55.044 --> 22:56.845
I mean, I know we can't
control where we come from...

22:56.846 --> 22:57.976
Oh, my god.

22:57.977 --> 23:00.048
Do you realize what
a snob you sound like?

23:00.049 --> 23:02.110
I just want you to be honest

23:02.111 --> 23:04.112
about what's really
going on here.

23:04.113 --> 23:05.954
You were in love
with him years ago.

23:05.955 --> 23:08.987
No, I was not in love with
him. And then he hurt you.

23:08.988 --> 23:11.059
And you're carrying around
all these unresolved feelings.

23:11.060 --> 23:13.522
No, that was a long
time ago. I'm over that.

23:13.523 --> 23:14.993
No, you're not.

23:14.994 --> 23:17.966
Your emotions are getting
in the way of your judgment.

23:17.967 --> 23:21.830
Let go of this. Let
justice take its course.

23:21.831 --> 23:23.932
Tommy doesn't need you.

23:23.933 --> 23:26.134
He needs a plea bargain.

23:26.135 --> 23:28.937
And you look like
you need some rest.

23:28.938 --> 23:30.680
Thank you.

23:32.542 --> 23:34.743
I'm gonna let you get some.

23:41.921 --> 23:43.922
She's wrong, you know?

23:43.923 --> 23:47.095
Tommy wouldn't do that.
He wouldn't hurt someone.

23:47.096 --> 23:49.798
You can't give up on him.

23:49.799 --> 23:52.561
Um, honestly, lace...

23:52.562 --> 23:55.033
I don't know what else I can do.

23:55.034 --> 23:57.536
The facts are not
on Tommy's side.

23:57.537 --> 23:59.868
The fact is, he
saved both our lives.

23:59.869 --> 24:02.070
You have to help him.

24:02.071 --> 24:04.773
I know I owe it to him...

24:04.774 --> 24:06.045
You owe it to yourself.

Hello, Kate.

27:23.172 --> 27:25.043
The chief understood you had
medical evidence to present,

27:25.044 --> 27:26.915

to be here as well.

27:31.380 --> 27:33.882
Detective Sullivan's blood work.

27:33.883 --> 27:37.325
The spike that you will
see is called zolpidem.

27:37.326 --> 27:38.857
It acts just like a roofie.

27:38.858 --> 27:41.129
It also explains all
of his symptoms...

27:41.130 --> 27:42.931
Compliance, aggression,

27:42.932 --> 27:44.232
loss of memory.

27:44.233 --> 27:46.194
It also proves that
he was drugged

27:46.195 --> 27:48.767
the night that Skylar
green was killed.

27:48.768 --> 27:50.368
Which implies
that he was framed.

27:50.369 --> 27:52.170
Meaning that you
have the wrong man.

27:52.171 --> 27:54.442
You got this blood off
the nightclub carpet?

27:54.443 --> 27:56.044
That's right.

27:56.045 --> 27:57.675
How do you know the
carpet wasn't contaminated?

27:57.676 --> 27:59.447
There are probably traces of
drugs everywhere in that place.

27:59.448 --> 28:01.149
Well, the point is the context.

28:01.150 --> 28:04.052
Tommy said he was drugged,
that is supporting evidence.

28:04.053 --> 28:05.383
Yes, but the problem is,

28:05.384 --> 28:08.056
the rest of the evidence
is extremely overwhelming.

28:08.057 --> 28:11.089
But you can't just ignore
this. This is reasonable doubt.

28:11.090 --> 28:12.420
(Exhales)

28:12.421 --> 28:14.092
All right, how about this?

28:14.093 --> 28:15.223
You call the d.A.

28:15.224 --> 28:17.095
You ask him to release
detective Sullivan

28:17.096 --> 28:19.427
on his own recognizance
for just 24 hours.

28:19.428 --> 28:20.799
Why?

28:20.800 --> 28:21.970
Sensorial reenactment.

28:21.971 --> 28:23.431
Maybe he can retrace
his steps last night,

28:23.432 --> 28:24.973
remember some details,

28:24.974 --> 28:26.274
so that we can
find the real killer.

28:26.275 --> 28:27.405
Megan's right.

28:27.406 --> 28:29.107
There are legitimate
studies to support that.

28:29.108 --> 28:31.940
Regardless, I can't
condone his release.

28:31.941 --> 28:34.813
Now if detective Sullivan
wants to make bail,

28:34.814 --> 28:36.214
of course, he can
do this on his own.

28:36.215 --> 28:39.447
He can't make bail.
Bail is set at $2 million.

28:39.448 --> 28:42.290
Could... could you ask
the d.A. To reduce it?

28:42.291 --> 28:43.451
Why would I do that?

28:43.452 --> 28:45.854
As a gesture of support
to one of your own.

28:45.855 --> 28:47.195
I can't take the risk

28:47.196 --> 28:50.098
precisely because
he is one of my own.

28:50.099 --> 28:52.160
So you're going to
let an innocent man

28:52.161 --> 28:54.102
lose his career
and his freedom...

28:54.103 --> 28:55.203

28:55.204 --> 28:56.234
Because you need
to cover your own ass

28:56.235 --> 28:57.505

28:57.506 --> 28:58.867
For all appearances,

28:58.868 --> 29:01.409
detective Sullivan
dug his own grave.

29:01.410 --> 29:04.012
And for whatever reason,

29:04.013 --> 29:07.146
you seem very
anxious to join him.

29:11.420 --> 29:13.852
Could you give us

29:13.853 --> 29:15.054

corruption in her own ranks.

29:24.193 --> 29:27.235
Oh, that was really good.
Where are the teleprompters?

29:27.236 --> 29:29.237
Why are you going
this far out on a limb

29:29.238 --> 29:30.538
for Tommy Sullivan?

29:30.539 --> 29:32.240
Is there something going
on between you two?

29:32.241 --> 29:33.202
No.

29:33.203 --> 29:34.542
But?

29:34.543 --> 29:36.174
What?

29:36.175 --> 29:38.376
What... what are
you not telling me?

29:38.377 --> 29:41.409
I-I knew him when
I was in New York.

29:41.410 --> 29:43.252
Uh, we used to date.

29:44.783 --> 29:46.184
And you never told me this?

29:46.185 --> 29:47.315
It's old news.

29:47.316 --> 29:50.418
Megan... the m.E.O.
Has to be impartial.

29:50.419 --> 29:53.561
You can't advocate
for a murder suspect.

29:53.562 --> 29:55.523
Listen, you've already
been ordered off of this case.

29:55.524 --> 29:57.295
You've got to stay
away from him.

29:57.296 --> 29:58.397
Or what?

30:00.199 --> 30:02.331
Don't make me go there, Megan.

30:06.005 --> 30:07.305
(Buzzer sounds)

30:07.306 --> 30:09.437
(Door clatters)

30:09.438 --> 30:11.209
It's your lucky day.

30:11.210 --> 30:12.941
You made bail.

30:12.942 --> 30:14.412
What?

30:14.413 --> 30:16.815
I don't know anybody
with that kind of money.

30:31.961 --> 30:35.063
So you never told me
how you could afford,

30:35.064 --> 30:36.534
uh, my bail. (Engine turns off)

30:36.535 --> 30:38.236
I couldn't.

30:38.237 --> 30:41.209
I put my condo
up for collateral.

30:41.210 --> 30:43.271
Also...

30:43.272 --> 30:45.843
(Exhales)

30:45.844 --> 30:47.416
Everything else.

30:49.178 --> 30:51.579
I don't... I don't
know what to say.

30:51.580 --> 30:53.121
Thank you.

30:53.122 --> 30:55.323
(Cell phone rings)

30:55.324 --> 30:56.554
(Beeps)

30:56.555 --> 30:58.226
You did see that
was your boss, right?

30:58.227 --> 31:00.858
My former boss. She
was calling to fire me.

31:00.859 --> 31:03.361
Because you're helping me.

31:03.362 --> 31:05.333
Megan, I don't want you

31:05.334 --> 31:07.165
to put everything
on the line like this.

31:07.166 --> 31:09.197
Why? You did the same for me.

31:09.198 --> 31:11.569
Yeah, but there doesn't
have to be a quid pro quo.

31:11.570 --> 31:14.402
The quid pro quo is...

31:14.403 --> 31:18.046
You tell me what really
happened in New York.

31:18.047 --> 31:20.910
(Exhales)

31:23.182 --> 31:26.154
My sister...

31:26.155 --> 31:27.986
She died in a
hit-and-run accident

31:27.987 --> 31:29.387
about a year ago.

31:29.388 --> 31:31.459
Laura?

31:31.460 --> 31:33.191
Oh, god. Tommy...

31:33.192 --> 31:34.662
Yeah. (Sighs)

31:34.663 --> 31:37.125
Somebody r-ran a red,

31:37.126 --> 31:38.967
some wall-street type.

31:38.968 --> 31:41.629
You know, and he's paid
his way out of two d.U.I.S.

31:41.630 --> 31:43.631
His lawyer convinced
the judge that there was

31:43.632 --> 31:46.004
reasonable doubt he
was behind the wheel.

31:46.005 --> 31:49.208
And I lost control.

31:50.209 --> 31:53.481
Broke some rules
and broke some bones.

31:53.482 --> 31:55.183
The guy didn't press charges

31:55.184 --> 31:56.484
'cause he didn't want
to be in the news,

31:56.485 --> 31:57.615
but NYPD tossed me,

31:57.616 --> 32:00.649
and I came here
for a fresh start.

32:02.221 --> 32:03.421
You could've told me.

32:03.422 --> 32:06.124
Yeah, I thought it
would scare you.

32:06.125 --> 32:08.357
Oh... (Laughs) It scares me.

32:09.959 --> 32:11.259
But the part of you that

32:11.260 --> 32:14.963
went outside the
law for your sister,

32:14.964 --> 32:19.107
it's the same part that
helped me and Lacey, so...

32:19.108 --> 32:21.309
I don't know how
I feel about it.

32:21.310 --> 32:24.473
I'm certainly not
gonna decide right now.

32:44.563 --> 32:46.294
(Exhales) You're
sure I was here?

32:46.295 --> 32:47.495
'Cause I got nothing.

32:47.496 --> 32:50.298
(Sighs) Can you turn up
the lights and the music

32:50.299 --> 32:51.639
like they would've been
a couple nights ago?

32:51.640 --> 32:53.072
Sure.

32:56.075 --> 32:57.275
(Sighs)

32:57.276 --> 33:00.148
(Blows air)

33:00.149 --> 33:04.113

33:11.490 --> 33:14.022

33:18.267 --> 33:20.068
With Skylar. She...

33:20.069 --> 33:21.669
(Speaks inaudibly)

33:21.670 --> 33:23.302
She's trying to
show me something.

33:25.474 --> 33:29.337
Uh, it's like a picture
or a... it's a photograph.

33:29.338 --> 33:30.438
(Megan) Keep trying.

33:30.439 --> 33:32.240
I...

33:32.241 --> 33:34.082
I can't. It...

33:34.083 --> 33:36.214
Do you think that she

33:46.355 --> 33:49.297

33:49.298 --> 33:51.399
Well, if she printed
something out, isn't there a...

33:51.400 --> 33:54.162
Ah, a picture still
in the cache, right.

33:54.163 --> 33:55.803
Okay, here we go. (Beeps)

33:55.804 --> 33:59.138
(Printer whirring)

34:05.274 --> 34:06.245
Oh, ho, ho. Ho. Ho.

34:06.246 --> 34:07.415
That's Steve Owen's club.

34:07.416 --> 34:08.576
Yeah, look in the background.

34:08.577 --> 34:10.047
Steve Owen.

34:10.048 --> 34:12.049
And the time stamp...
November 17th, 11:30 P.M.

34:12.050 --> 34:13.381
That's when he was
supposedly killing his partner.

34:13.382 --> 34:15.753
Skylar finally found someone
who could prove his alibi.

34:15.754 --> 34:17.255
That's why she was killed.

34:17.256 --> 34:20.088
Time stamp's can
be incorrect or faked.

34:20.089 --> 34:21.429
No, this is definitely real,

34:21.430 --> 34:22.590
otherwise, she wouldn't
have been killed.

34:22.591 --> 34:24.462
Besides, it'd be easy to I.D.

34:24.463 --> 34:25.633
These people in the photo,

34:25.634 --> 34:27.565
have them confirm
the time frame.

34:27.566 --> 34:29.237
Then that means

34:29.238 --> 34:32.270
her killer knew that she
was bringing it to you.

34:32.271 --> 34:34.102
Tommy?

34:34.103 --> 34:35.744
I chased him outside.

34:36.805 --> 34:39.307
(Tommy) See, I was weak

34:39.308 --> 34:41.509
and my head was spinning,

34:41.510 --> 34:43.311
and I fell.

34:43.312 --> 34:45.713
He ran.

34:45.714 --> 34:48.316
I-I couldn't keep
up with him, but he...

34:48.317 --> 34:51.620
(Panting and grunting)

34:55.524 --> 34:57.466
But he hopped a fence. (Grunts)

34:59.368 --> 35:01.300
This is where he
went over, right here.

35:21.220 --> 35:23.152
You're right.

35:27.356 --> 35:29.126
This looks like the
sample of fabric

35:29.127 --> 35:30.599
that we found in your belt.

35:32.761 --> 35:35.333
It's got some
kind of dust on it.

35:35.334 --> 35:37.335
Maybe there's something
in the trial evidence

35:37.336 --> 35:40.168
that'll help us
I.D. The real killer.

35:40.169 --> 35:42.471
(Tommy) I'll check it
out. I'll go see his lawyer.

35:49.278 --> 35:50.618
(Man) Remarkable.

35:50.619 --> 35:52.720
I tried so hard to prove
Steve Owen's alibi,

35:52.721 --> 35:55.883
and you turn up solid
evidence in two days.

35:55.884 --> 35:57.785
Well, it took Skylar months.

35:57.786 --> 36:00.628
We have to assume that whoever
framed Steve Owen for murder

36:00.629 --> 36:02.290
killed her, too.

36:02.291 --> 36:04.292
And framed you in the process.

36:04.293 --> 36:07.365
My understanding is, you
were arrested for her murder?

36:07.366 --> 36:10.198
Yeah. Look, I-I proved
your client is innocent.

36:10.199 --> 36:11.539
I was just hoping

36:11.540 --> 36:13.541
you might be able to
do the same for me.

36:13.542 --> 36:15.603
I'd like to look at all the
evidence you've collected,

36:15.604 --> 36:17.205
admissible or not.

36:17.206 --> 36:18.776
I'll pull the files.

36:18.777 --> 36:21.250
Let's see what we can find.

36:23.282 --> 36:27.515
Oh, uh, Steve should
be here any minute.

36:27.516 --> 36:29.457
If Kate finds out we helped you,

36:29.458 --> 36:31.889
we all goin' down, big-time.

36:31.890 --> 36:33.421
If it makes you feel any better,

36:33.422 --> 36:34.892
I'll probably get fired, too.

36:34.893 --> 36:36.564
It doesn't.

36:36.565 --> 36:38.396
The fibers from the belt

36:38.397 --> 36:39.397
that was used to
strangle Skylar green

36:39.398 --> 36:41.599
match the fibers from the fence.

36:41.600 --> 36:43.531
You were right.

36:43.532 --> 36:46.404
But the piece you recovered
tells us something else.

36:46.405 --> 36:49.277
Hmm. Machine stitching.

36:49.278 --> 36:51.239
It looks like the
seam of a glove.

36:51.240 --> 36:52.410
Exactly.

36:52.411 --> 36:53.741
So our killer wore gloves.

36:53.742 --> 36:55.443
That narrows it
down to, like, anyone.

36:55.444 --> 36:56.914
(Curtis) Not quite.

36:56.915 --> 36:58.346
Look at that.

36:58.347 --> 37:00.248
The dust we found
on the glove fragment...

37:00.249 --> 37:02.350
It's gypsum and recycled paper.

37:02.351 --> 37:03.851
Comes from new drywall.

37:03.852 --> 37:05.923
So it's not just any
glove. It's a work glove.

37:05.924 --> 37:08.597
Used in construction.

37:10.329 --> 37:12.230
Megan, we got a problem.

37:25.344 --> 37:27.315
(Grunts)

37:27.316 --> 37:32.981
Aah! Ohh!

37:33.822 --> 37:35.483
Ah!

37:35.484 --> 37:36.585
(Grunts)

37:45.734 --> 37:49.998
(Both grunting)

37:53.872 --> 37:55.443
Ah!

37:55.444 --> 37:56.844
(Grunts)

37:56.845 --> 37:58.406
Oh!

37:58.407 --> 38:00.608
(Both grunting)

38:00.609 --> 38:02.580
Uhh!

38:02.581 --> 38:04.482
(Grunts)

38:04.483 --> 38:05.614
(Pants)

38:07.756 --> 38:09.417
(Pops) Aah!

38:09.418 --> 38:10.719
(Grunts)

38:12.861 --> 38:14.362
Ohh!

38:14.363 --> 38:16.293
Tommy. Tommy. (Tommy,
strained voice) Yeah.

38:16.294 --> 38:18.025
Wait. Wait. Wait.

38:18.026 --> 38:19.597
Tommy, stay down. Just...

38:19.598 --> 38:20.898
No, I'm fine.

38:20.899 --> 38:22.069
Stop. I'm fine.

38:22.070 --> 38:23.401
Stop. Rel... (Grunts)

38:23.402 --> 38:24.532
Tommy.

38:24.533 --> 38:25.973
(Groans)

38:25.974 --> 38:27.775
Where's it hurt?

38:27.776 --> 38:28.936
I don't know.

38:28.937 --> 38:30.608
You big dummy.

38:30.609 --> 38:33.481
I just need... I need c.P.R.

38:33.482 --> 38:34.443
Yeah.

38:34.444 --> 38:35.913
(Chuckles)

38:35.914 --> 38:39.787
You need a pop in the mouth.

38:39.788 --> 38:42.450
So we found this at your house.

38:42.451 --> 38:43.751
(Clears throat)

38:43.752 --> 38:45.693
It's Steve Owen's
accounting book,

38:45.694 --> 38:47.094
with all the cooking.

38:47.095 --> 38:48.596
You've been skimming
off of every deal

38:48.597 --> 38:49.757
you were an attorney on.

38:49.758 --> 38:51.959
When his partner
Jason found out,

38:51.960 --> 38:53.330
you killed him,

38:53.331 --> 38:54.862
tried to frame
Owen for the murder.

38:54.863 --> 38:56.404
And you suppressed any evidence

38:56.405 --> 38:57.635
that would've
strengthened his case.

38:57.636 --> 38:59.507
This is all circumstantial.

38:59.508 --> 39:01.409
That's true, except for

39:01.410 --> 39:03.771
we found these
gloves in your car

39:03.772 --> 39:05.443
under the driver's seat.

39:05.444 --> 39:07.014
We found fragments

39:07.015 --> 39:09.447
of the leather gloves

39:09.448 --> 39:11.018
on a fence near the crime scene.

39:11.019 --> 39:13.781
And identical leather
on the murder weapon.

39:13.782 --> 39:16.584
Skylar green called
you at your office

39:16.585 --> 39:18.125
the day she was murdered.

39:18.126 --> 39:21.128
She wanted to tell you
something that she found out.

39:21.129 --> 39:23.591
You knew you had to silence her.

39:23.592 --> 39:26.694
You killed an innocent girl,

39:26.695 --> 39:29.697
a sweet girl, in cold blood.

39:29.698 --> 39:31.699
All Skylar wanted to do

39:31.700 --> 39:33.000
was to prove that her
friend was innocent.

39:33.001 --> 39:34.371
You killed her for it,

39:34.372 --> 39:36.103
just like you did Jason banning.

39:36.104 --> 39:37.775
I want you to know
that I'm gonna do

39:37.776 --> 39:39.807
everything in my power

39:39.808 --> 39:44.081
to make sure that you never
see the light of day again.

39:44.082 --> 39:46.114
Is there anything else you
want to say, Mr. Lawson?

39:47.856 --> 39:49.858
I want a lawyer.

39:51.660 --> 39:55.923
And with my profound apologies
to the defendant and his family,

39:55.924 --> 39:58.996
I motion for dismissal
of all charges

39:58.997 --> 40:00.998
against Steve Owen.

40:00.999 --> 40:03.501
The motion is granted.

40:03.502 --> 40:05.503
(Man) All rise.

40:05.504 --> 40:08.636
(Indistinct conversations)

40:08.637 --> 40:09.978
You ready? All right.

40:11.440 --> 40:13.581
No need to apologize.

40:13.582 --> 40:15.643
(Laughs)

40:15.644 --> 40:18.446
On second thought, go ahead.

40:18.447 --> 40:21.418
I hope you can understand
the position I was in.

40:21.419 --> 40:23.451
You mean being wrong?

40:23.452 --> 40:25.823
Oh, you are not going to accept
an apology gracefully, are you?

40:25.824 --> 40:27.455
Mnh-mnh.

40:27.456 --> 40:29.156
Well, I'm just glad you're back.

40:29.157 --> 40:32.530
Tommy Sullivan is lucky to have
you in his corner. (Speaks indistinctly)

40:32.531 --> 40:34.161
I'm just glad you
weren't wrong about him.

40:34.162 --> 40:36.704
Uh, that remains to be seen.

40:36.705 --> 40:38.135
What do you mean?

40:38.136 --> 40:39.637
(Indistinct
conversations continue)

40:39.638 --> 40:41.670
I'll see you at work.

40:46.615 --> 40:48.516
How's the arm?

40:48.517 --> 40:50.848
Thanks to the wonders of
modern medication, it's fine.

40:50.849 --> 40:53.581
Listen, I don't know how
to thank the both of you.

40:53.582 --> 40:55.723
Yeah, that's not really
true. He tried to hug me.

40:55.724 --> 40:57.084
Didn't go down well.

40:57.085 --> 40:58.956
Yeah, he's uncomfortable
with displays of affection.

40:58.957 --> 41:03.531
Oh, it's nice to know the
two of you are so evolved.

41:03.532 --> 41:06.635
So I'll... See you back there.

41:09.698 --> 41:12.541
Right. I gotta go. Um...

41:14.472 --> 41:17.144
Yeah. You do realize this is...

41:17.145 --> 41:18.475
Where it all started,

41:18.476 --> 41:20.948
with an innocent
invitation for drinks?

41:20.949 --> 41:23.551
There was nothing
innocent about that invitation.

41:23.552 --> 41:26.113
Well, yeah, I mean, I used
the case as an excuse,

41:26.114 --> 41:27.615
but I'm not going
to do it again.

41:27.616 --> 41:29.486
So let's go have a drink.

41:29.487 --> 41:30.258
Oh, are you sure?

41:30.259 --> 41:32.520
The last time you asked me out,

41:32.521 --> 41:34.121
you got arrested for murder.

41:34.122 --> 41:35.923
You did come back
to the bar that night...

41:35.924 --> 41:37.625
(Sighs) To take
me up on my offer.

41:37.626 --> 41:38.766
I never should've admitted that.

41:38.767 --> 41:40.097
No, you shouldn't have.

41:40.098 --> 41:42.830
It was a momentary lapse
brought on by three tequilas.

41:42.831 --> 41:45.102
Which I hope to
replicate with three more.

41:45.103 --> 41:47.605
You are the eternal optimist.

41:47.606 --> 41:49.607
You know, you
haven't said no yet.

41:49.608 --> 41:51.239
(Huffs)

41:52.541 --> 41:53.981
All right.

41:53.982 --> 41:57.084
But I am going
home tonight, alone.

41:57.085 --> 41:58.245
Sure you are.

41:58.246 --> 41:59.617
Just stop talking.

41:59.618 --> 42:00.589
Not my strong suit.

42:00.590 --> 42:02.249
Well, what is, really?

42:02.250 --> 42:04.923
Have three tequilas,
I'll show you.
