There was a slight gag reflex,

Our findings indicate
very few brain-stem reflexes.

04:47.320 --> 04:49.753
I'm sorry, but at this point,
we feel it's appropriate

Mr. Claybourne,
your sister has suffered

04:57.493 --> 04:58.959
A devastating hemorrhage.

04:58.961 --> 05:01.461
There's very little
brain-stem function left,

05:01.463 --> 05:04.564
Which means that her body
is being kept alive by machines.

05:04.566 --> 05:05.898
And if we remove
those machines,

05:05.900 --> 05:07.432
We believe
she will die within minutes.

05:07.434 --> 05:08.683
All right,
stop right there,

05:08.684 --> 05:09.933
'cause she's been hooked up
to machines before,

05:09.936 --> 05:11.001
And she came back.

05:11.003 --> 05:13.737
I know how difficult
this must be,

05:13.739 --> 05:15.472
But there's nothing more
we can do.

05:15.474 --> 05:17.841
If you choose to keep

did you say "if"?

...She'll have to be moved
to a long-term nursing facility.

05:22.012 --> 05:23.978
And even then,
in my professional opinion,

05:23.980 --> 05:25.713
Recovery is not likely.

05:25.714 --> 05:27.447
It's not likely,
but it's not impossible, right?

05:27.450 --> 05:28.582
I mean, can you tell me,

05:28.584 --> 05:29.916
With absolute certainty
over there,

05:29.918 --> 05:31.951
That my sister
won't wake up?
Of course not.

05:31.953 --> 05:33.752
In the medical profession,
nothing's 100%.
Then that's it. No.

05:33.754 --> 05:35.253
We're not taking her
off life support.

05:35.255 --> 05:38.022
Mr. Claybourne,
I appreciate how you feel,

05:38.024 --> 05:40.023
But, respectfully,
it's not up to you.

05:41.626 --> 05:43.626
It's up to ms. O'connor.

05:44.762 --> 05:45.994
Excuse me?

05:45.996 --> 05:47.662
You have

before the surgery.

05:49.332 --> 05:50.764

and yours alone.

You're just saying my opinion
doesn't matter at all here?

06:08.190 --> 06:09.367
Of course it matters.
You're family.

06:09.368 --> 06:10.545
The doctor's just
got to follow the rules

06:10.548 --> 06:11.813
And do things officially.

06:11.815 --> 06:13.948
All right, fine --
officially, then,

06:13.950 --> 06:15.916

06:22.389 --> 06:23.488
Scarlett, no, baby.

06:23.490 --> 06:25.490
Even the doc here
himself --

06:25.491 --> 06:27.491
He admitted that they can't be
100% sure she's gone.

06:27.494 --> 06:28.926
She came back once.
She can do it again, all right?

06:28.928 --> 06:30.928
She just needs some time,
baby.

06:30.930 --> 06:32.462
[ sighs ]
just time.

06:32.464 --> 06:33.896
I-is she in pain?

06:33.898 --> 06:35.564
No, we don't think so.

06:35.566 --> 06:36.765
But just because
there's no pain

06:36.767 --> 06:38.433
Doesn't mean
she's not suffering.

06:38.435 --> 06:40.034
What the hell
does that mean?

06:40.036 --> 06:42.870
It means we could
keep her alive indefinitely,

06:42.872 --> 06:44.638
But the likelihood
of a meaningful recovery

06:44.640 --> 06:46.706
Is very, very low.

06:46.708 --> 06:50.843
However, if you choose to
let your mother go peacefully,

06:50.845 --> 06:53.812
Her death could have tremendous
meaning for so many families.

06:53.814 --> 06:56.748
I-I don't have to tell you the
importance of organ donation.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.049
Okay, look, you need
to back off right now.

06:58.051 --> 06:59.383
No, no, no. Wait.
You understand me?

06:59.385 --> 07:00.751
Just --
you back off.

07:00.753 --> 07:03.053
What if she is<i> not</i> gone?

07:03.055 --> 07:04.821
What if she is
that one in a million?

07:05.990 --> 07:07.756
Perhaps I can help you
better understand

07:07.758 --> 07:09.023
What we're up against.

07:09.025 --> 07:11.091
There's something
called an apnea test.

07:11.093 --> 07:13.827
We would slowly take your mother
off life support

07:13.829 --> 07:15.595
In a controlled environment

07:15.597 --> 07:17.797
And see if she can
take a breath on her own.

07:17.799 --> 07:19.898
It might help you
with the decision.

07:22.702 --> 07:24.101

Well, that's not gonna be
an acceptable answer.

You are gonna tell me

Was she harassing you?

We are.

And that he's going to jail
for a long time.

And I tried to tell her
that he's innocent,

since she went on tour.

So I thought
music might help.

27:35.311 --> 27:37.311
I remembered I had
your lullaby on my phone,

27:37.313 --> 27:38.312
And...Worked like a charm.

27:54.724 --> 27:56.657
You're not shocked,
right?

27:56.659 --> 27:59.292
This is juliette barnes
we're talking about --

27:59.294 --> 28:02.895
The most selfish, immature,
unreliable person on the planet.

28:02.897 --> 28:04.796
I mean, honestly,
what the hell was I thinking?

28:04.798 --> 28:07.398
How could I ever believe that
she actually wanted a family?

28:07.400 --> 28:08.532
It's crazy.

28:09.668 --> 28:11.634
I'm sorry.

to lay all this on you.

you helping me out today.

You wanting to punish juliette
for what she's done,

28:30.317 --> 28:33.017

I know it's not
what you want to hear,

28:59.507 --> 29:00.806
But I need you with me
on this.

29:00.808 --> 29:02.340
I need you beside me.
I can't do it on my own.

You go against my wishes here?

It's not easy, deacon,
but we have to let her go.

29:08.848 --> 29:10.314
No.

We don't.

We can let her live.
We can give her time.

29:17.755 --> 29:20.989
Even if, in 10 years' time,
she wakes up,

29:20.991 --> 29:23.524
She's not going to be her
anymore.

29:23.526 --> 29:25.058
She's not going to be able
to walk or talk.

who we are.

who<i> she</i> is.

29:27.996 --> 29:29.628
And I know
you don't want that for her.

There are things
that are worse than death.

29:30.998 --> 29:34.666
How do you know? Huh?
How do any of us know that?

29:34.668 --> 29:37.068
She was supposedly in a coma
for a month,

29:37.070 --> 29:39.570
But she told me
she heard me singing to her.

29:39.572 --> 29:41.088
All right?
She knew I was there.

29:41.089 --> 29:42.605

just as aware right now?

what you're planning,

29:46.777 --> 29:48.676
And she's not just saying,
"don't do it"?!

29:48.678 --> 29:50.110
She is my mother!
And I love her!

29:50.112 --> 29:51.711
I don't want this.
I want her to live.

29:51.713 --> 29:52.912
Then let her live.

29:52.914 --> 29:54.580
That's not living.

29:54.582 --> 29:55.681
And I know
you feel guilty.

29:55.682 --> 29:56.781
I know you feel
that if she dies,

29:56.784 --> 29:58.016
It is your fault --
that you killed her --

29:58.018 --> 29:59.518
And it's not true.

30:01.021 --> 30:03.087
This is
a terrible, terrible tragedy.

30:03.089 --> 30:07.124
And the best we can do now is
make her death mean something.

30:07.126 --> 30:10.961
She can save so many lives,
just like she saved yours.

30:10.963 --> 30:12.629
But every moment counts.

30:14.032 --> 30:15.898
