01:49.083 --> 01:50.499
We settled this.

01:50.500 --> 01:51.789
Uh, expand or die.

01:51.790 --> 01:53.169
It's not
about settling...

01:53.170 --> 01:54.379
Hi, Maia.

01:54.380 --> 01:55.709
Thanks for
coming in early.

01:55.710 --> 01:56.959
Have you been
waiting long?

01:56.960 --> 01:58.879
No. Am I being fired?

01:58.880 --> 02:01.619
Are you...? What?

02:01.620 --> 02:05.459
Nothing. It's just, um, you're
both here at the same time.

02:05.460 --> 02:08.038
No. This is our twice yearly
progress report on associates.

02:08.039 --> 02:10.499
Phew. Well, sorry.

02:10.500 --> 02:13.379
We've solicited notes and
criticism from the partners,

02:13.380 --> 02:15.879
and it's been pretty uniform.

02:15.880 --> 02:17.169
Everyone thinks
you're smart.

02:17.170 --> 02:18.879
Okay.

02:18.880 --> 02:20.579
And we all know you have
been distracted

02:20.580 --> 02:22.329
by the business
with your family.

02:22.330 --> 02:23.919
Yes. I'm sorry. I've, I've tried

02:23.920 --> 02:25.959
not to let it get in the way...

02:25.960 --> 02:28.749
But the report also points
to a problematic area.

02:28.750 --> 02:29.959
Boldness.

02:29.960 --> 02:32.829
Yes. You need
to assert yourself more.

02:32.830 --> 02:34.290
- Speak up.
- I'm sorry.

02:34.293 --> 02:35.960
- I want to...
- Maia.

02:35.963 --> 02:37.959
That is your third apology
in 30 seconds.

02:37.960 --> 02:38.960
Forget apologizing.

02:38.961 --> 02:42.919
Jump in.
Don't hesitate.

02:42.920 --> 02:44.079
Look, choose a partner.

02:44.080 --> 02:45.669
Diane, Thomas.

02:45.670 --> 02:47.749
And you follow them
around all day.

02:47.750 --> 02:49.879
24 hours.
Learn from them.

02:49.880 --> 02:51.169
You don't take no for an answer.

02:51.170 --> 02:53.959
Insist on following
them around. Okay?

02:53.960 --> 02:56.249
Okay, got it.

02:56.250 --> 02:58.039
All right. Go kick some ass.

02:58.040 --> 03:00.879
Thank you.

03:02.540 --> 03:04.289
Do you think that worked?

03:04.290 --> 03:05.959
No.

03:05.960 --> 03:08.920
Let's give her two weeks.

03:20.670 --> 03:21.999
Lucca.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.209
Thank you for
coming in early.

03:23.210 --> 03:24.539
No problem.

03:24.540 --> 03:26.959
This is the bi-yearly review?

03:26.960 --> 03:28.790
- Yes.
- How'd I do?

03:28.793 --> 03:30.249
You kicked ass.

03:30.250 --> 03:31.999
You have the most
billable hours on the floor.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.169
All of the partners
praise your work.

03:34.170 --> 03:36.789
Lucca, we don't
want to lose you.

03:36.790 --> 03:38.119
We'd like to move you
to a bigger office

03:38.120 --> 03:39.460
and put you on
the partner track.

03:40.960 --> 03:42.169
Seriously?

03:42.170 --> 03:44.460
Seriously.

03:47.960 --> 03:49.879
They hate me.

03:49.880 --> 03:51.539
No one hates you.

03:51.540 --> 03:52.749
Who?

03:52.750 --> 03:54.169
The partners.

03:54.170 --> 03:55.539
My review.

03:55.540 --> 03:57.959
Every associate gets
a mediocre review.

03:57.960 --> 03:59.669
No, they don't.

03:59.670 --> 04:00.670
What, did you?

04:00.671 --> 04:02.749
It was mixed.

04:05.170 --> 04:06.999
Any word from the FBI?

04:07.000 --> 04:10.119
No, but my guess is
they bury it.

04:10.120 --> 04:12.119
You're an afterthought
in this scandal.

04:12.120 --> 04:14.119
You'll represent me
if I'm indicted?

04:14.120 --> 04:15.500
You will not be indicted.

04:15.503 --> 04:17.249
Good to know.

04:18.329 --> 04:19.539
Come by for dinner tonight.

04:19.540 --> 04:20.540
- If I can.
- Mmm.

04:23.960 --> 04:25.919
Gonna miss that so much.

04:25.920 --> 04:27.289
Okay, first question:

04:27.290 --> 04:28.879
Which is most essential
in a fixed surveillance?

04:28.880 --> 04:31.079
Constant communication,
long-term memory,

04:31.080 --> 04:32.829
patience or agility?

04:32.830 --> 04:35.039
Patience. Do you think they'd
want two investigators here?

04:35.040 --> 04:36.249
Nope.

04:36.250 --> 04:37.419
Why not?

04:37.420 --> 04:38.539
Money.

04:38.540 --> 04:39.829
Do you want to retire?

04:39.830 --> 04:40.919
Nope.

04:40.920 --> 04:42.079
Then I'm coming after your job.

04:42.080 --> 04:43.499
Bring it.

04:45.080 --> 04:47.959
Diane Lockhart's office,
we're here to serve.

04:47.960 --> 04:49.039
Oh, hi.

04:49.040 --> 04:51.249
Yeah, hold on.

04:51.250 --> 04:53.459
Kurt McVeigh is on
the other line.

04:53.460 --> 04:55.669
I'll have to call him back,
my 10:00 is here.

04:55.670 --> 04:57.460
- Would you show them in?
- Sure.

04:57.463 --> 04:59.829
I'm thinking of becoming
an investigator here.

04:59.830 --> 05:02.079
What?

05:02.080 --> 05:04.119
I'm thinking of becoming
an investigator here.

05:04.120 --> 05:05.789
Will you talk to Boseman?

05:05.790 --> 05:07.539
Uh, no.

05:07.540 --> 05:09.919
Uh, you talk to him,
and then, I'll follow up.

05:09.920 --> 05:11.830
My new client?

05:18.080 --> 05:21.959
Hi. Are you here for Diane?

05:21.960 --> 05:23.959
I'm Diane's assistant,
but I also sometimes work

05:23.960 --> 05:24.999
as an investigator.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.329
Would you like to come back?

05:26.330 --> 05:28.330
Yes.

05:29.750 --> 05:31.169
Can I get you anything?

05:31.170 --> 05:33.289
A garbage bag.

05:33.290 --> 05:36.329
Actually, I was thinking
more a glass of water.

05:36.330 --> 05:38.619
Ms. Lockhart, your 10:00.

05:38.620 --> 05:40.289
Mr. Stack.

05:40.290 --> 05:41.539
Yes, hi.

05:41.540 --> 05:42.579
How are you, Diane?

05:42.580 --> 05:43.749
I'm well.

05:43.750 --> 05:46.539
I, um... Please, sit down.

05:46.540 --> 05:49.209
Why, uh, didn't
you give your name?

05:49.210 --> 05:51.579
Well, I was worried you wouldn't
want me as a client.

05:51.580 --> 05:53.749
I wanted to get a chance
to argue my case.

05:53.750 --> 05:55.959
That's crazy. Why wouldn't
I want you as a client?

05:55.960 --> 05:58.379
Oh. Bitcoin.

05:58.380 --> 06:01.419
I thought it was all a bit too
"disruptive economy" for you.

06:01.420 --> 06:02.959
Well, maybe for
Lockhart/Gardner,

06:02.960 --> 06:04.879
but here, you'll fit right in.

06:04.880 --> 06:08.079
So, what's the case
you want to argue?

06:08.080 --> 06:10.499
I'm being set up.

06:10.500 --> 06:12.619
For what?

06:12.620 --> 06:14.829
Cyber terrorism.

06:14.830 --> 06:17.459
Well, that's certainly serious.

06:17.460 --> 06:18.789
Here you go.

06:18.790 --> 06:20.499
Oh, thanks.

06:20.500 --> 06:23.039
Chicago is converting

06:23.040 --> 06:24.789
to a smart grid
power infrastructure,

06:24.790 --> 06:26.419
run on computers,
and during the switchover,

06:26.420 --> 06:29.829
the system is vulnerable
to a malware attack,

06:29.830 --> 06:32.379
like Grizzly Steppe.

06:32.380 --> 06:34.999
Okay. I understood about
five of those words.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.289
Grizzly Steppe
was a Russian hack

06:36.290 --> 06:38.039
on the Vermont power grid
last year.

06:38.040 --> 06:40.210
Don't ask me how I know that.

06:42.420 --> 06:46.249
This code is identical.

06:46.250 --> 06:48.829
It's been injected
into ETB Energy

06:48.830 --> 06:51.249
and will cause a Chicago
blackout in nine hours.

06:51.250 --> 06:54.039
And why is it on your computer?

06:54.040 --> 06:55.249
I don't know.

06:55.250 --> 06:56.919
I encrypt everything.

06:56.920 --> 07:00.079
I run all my net contacts
through eight, 10 servers.

07:00.080 --> 07:02.169
Nothing viral ends up
on my hard drive.

07:02.170 --> 07:04.789
And yet, I woke up this morning,
and there it was.

07:04.790 --> 07:07.999
Somebody put this code
on my laptop,

07:08.000 --> 07:10.879
and wants me to be arrested
for cyber terrorism.

07:10.880 --> 07:13.329
How much
are your retainers?

07:13.330 --> 07:14.789
Um, for clients?

07:14.790 --> 07:16.119
It depends.

07:16.120 --> 07:18.079
Hold that?

07:18.080 --> 07:19.710
How's $90,000?

07:25.960 --> 07:28.499
What is he, a drug dealer?

07:28.500 --> 07:29.749
No, it's Bitcoin.

07:29.750 --> 07:33.289
It's trading at $1,226.

07:33.290 --> 07:34.499
More than gold.

07:34.500 --> 07:36.919
And he wants
us to do what?

07:36.920 --> 07:39.959
This is the malware
from his computer.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.379
He wants us to offer
the feds a deal.

07:42.380 --> 07:44.879
He will defuse the malware
from the power grid

07:44.880 --> 07:46.379
if they offer him immunity.

07:46.380 --> 07:48.039
And if they don't?

07:48.040 --> 07:50.879
Well, he wants us to keep
his identity confidential,

07:50.880 --> 07:52.249
in case they don't.

07:52.250 --> 07:53.919
Well, we are ethically bound

07:53.920 --> 07:55.879
to tell the authorities
about this.

07:55.880 --> 07:58.879
It's a crime that will happen
at 7:00 p.m. either way.

07:58.880 --> 08:01.789
We need to talk to the DOJ.

08:01.790 --> 08:03.960
Who do we trust over there?

08:14.790 --> 08:16.209
Well, hello, Ms. Quinn.

08:16.210 --> 08:18.209
Hello, Mr. Morrello.

08:18.210 --> 08:21.460
I'm having a meeting in here.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.959
It's been a while.

08:27.960 --> 08:29.209
You didn't call.

08:29.210 --> 08:31.789
Oh, I didn't think
I was supposed to.

08:31.790 --> 08:33.958
Why not?

08:33.960 --> 08:37.789
After a breakup,
it's customary.

08:37.789 --> 08:39.328
Was that a breakup?

08:39.330 --> 08:40.749
Was it not?

08:40.750 --> 08:44.579
I... don't know.

08:44.580 --> 08:47.329
Oh, hey, um,

08:47.330 --> 08:48.829
I found this.

08:48.830 --> 08:51.459
I think I wore it
home one night.

08:52.830 --> 08:53.830
Oh.

08:53.831 --> 08:55.619
Yeah, I've been
looking for that.

08:55.620 --> 08:57.209
Thanks.

08:57.210 --> 08:58.920
You keep it.

09:00.210 --> 09:01.829
Okay.

09:01.830 --> 09:03.919
So what do you need?

09:03.920 --> 09:05.379
Well.

09:05.380 --> 09:07.829
Hypothetically speaking,
if we had a client

09:07.830 --> 09:10.499
who had knowledge
of a crime being committed

09:10.500 --> 09:13.459
tonight, let's say,

09:13.460 --> 09:16.079
and he wanted to help you
prevent that crime,

09:16.080 --> 09:17.749
might there be a deal
to immunize him?

09:17.750 --> 09:18.999
Well, that would depend.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.039
Is he responsible for the crime?

09:21.040 --> 09:22.289
No.

09:22.290 --> 09:23.499
Okay, what is the crime?

09:23.500 --> 09:24.879
An attack on the power grid.

09:24.880 --> 09:26.920
Cyber terrorism.

09:31.620 --> 09:34.669
And how does your client
know about it?

09:34.670 --> 09:36.919
He found this on his computer.

09:36.920 --> 09:39.289
Who's the client?

09:39.290 --> 09:40.879
You understand I can't tell you.

09:40.880 --> 09:42.829
He's worried he'll be prosecuted
if you know.

09:42.830 --> 09:44.920
But if you can make a deal...

09:46.710 --> 09:49.330
Okay. Can I take this?

09:59.420 --> 10:00.709
Come in.

10:00.710 --> 10:02.919
None of us want to go to trial.

10:02.920 --> 10:05.249
But for us,
it's just about time and money.

10:05.250 --> 10:08.329
For you, it's about
a life sentence.

10:08.330 --> 10:09.749
Important.

10:09.750 --> 10:11.879
Look, I have another meeting.

10:11.880 --> 10:13.919
But here's your bottom line:

10:13.920 --> 10:16.619
immediate surrender,
35 years.

10:16.620 --> 10:17.959
35 years?

10:17.960 --> 10:18.880
Are you kidding?
What happened to ten?

10:18.881 --> 10:20.209
Ten was in trade

10:20.210 --> 10:21.709
for Mr. Rindell's
testimony.

10:21.710 --> 10:22.959
We can't use
it anymore.

10:22.960 --> 10:24.079
This
is bullshit.

10:24.080 --> 10:25.879
Think
about it, Henry.

10:25.880 --> 10:28.249
Madoff would've killed
for 35 years.

10:28.250 --> 10:29.789
This is an exploding deal.

10:29.790 --> 10:31.960
12 hours, and it's gone.

10:32.920 --> 10:35.879
Henry, Henry. Don't panic.

10:35.880 --> 10:39.039
We can still talk them down,
just let me do my work.

10:39.040 --> 10:40.959
It's over, Rupert.

10:40.960 --> 10:42.709
They can't offer
me a better deal.

10:42.710 --> 10:44.959
Not after the backlash
over the ten years.

10:44.960 --> 10:47.540
We still have options,
don't lose hope.

10:51.120 --> 10:53.670
Give me a minute, please.

11:02.830 --> 11:04.329
Yeah.

11:04.330 --> 11:06.829
You told me to call
if it ever got to that point.

11:06.830 --> 11:09.879
I think it just got
to that point.

11:09.880 --> 11:12.209
So who's this hacker?

11:12.210 --> 11:15.749
Lawyer's been asked
by the client not to say.

11:15.750 --> 11:17.209
And who's this lawyer?

11:17.210 --> 11:18.789
Why?

11:18.790 --> 11:21.999
Just trying to get as
many facts as I can.

11:22.000 --> 11:26.079
Look, if we don't want to make
the deal, let's not do it.

11:26.080 --> 11:27.919
I have to think about it.

11:27.920 --> 11:29.789
It's supposed to hit
the power grid tonight?

11:29.790 --> 11:31.329
Yes, around 7:00.

11:31.330 --> 11:35.330
Okay. Tell her
I'll get back to her.

11:36.500 --> 11:37.500
"Her"?

11:38.540 --> 11:40.079
Yeah.

11:40.080 --> 11:41.380
It's just a guess.

11:47.120 --> 11:48.120
Doing great, guys.

11:48.120 --> 11:49.120
Doing great.

12:06.080 --> 12:07.619
Diane.

12:07.620 --> 12:09.379
Uh, do you have a second?

12:09.380 --> 12:10.789
Sure.

12:10.790 --> 12:12.879
Am I in danger here?

12:12.880 --> 12:13.919
What do you mean?

12:13.920 --> 12:15.169
My review.

12:15.170 --> 12:17.999
There was concern
I'm not bold enough.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.879
That's just
constructive criticism.

12:19.880 --> 12:21.289
Everyone's getting it.

12:21.290 --> 12:23.499
I spoke to Marissa Tod...

12:23.500 --> 12:24.999
Oh, damn.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.619
I'm sorry, Maia.
I forgot something.

12:26.620 --> 12:28.289
Marissa. I forgot
Kurt called.

12:28.290 --> 12:29.789
Could you return?

12:29.790 --> 12:31.879
Yes, but Diane, there's someone
on the line for you.

12:31.880 --> 12:33.250
- I think it's important.
- Who?

12:33.253 --> 12:35.250
A nurse at Harbour, line six.

12:36.880 --> 12:38.169
Hello.

12:38.170 --> 12:40.620
- Hello, is this Diane Lockhart?
- It is.

12:40.623 --> 12:42.999
This is Nurse McRaney
at Harbour Hospital.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.039
You're listed as the next
of kin to Mr. Kurt McVeigh.

12:46.040 --> 12:48.709
Yes. What's wrong?

12:48.710 --> 12:50.379
I need to speak
to the next of kin.

12:50.380 --> 12:51.999
Y-Yes, I-I am.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.079
I'm his wife.
What's wrong?

12:54.080 --> 12:56.379
Move him down the hall
and give him extra fluids.

12:56.380 --> 12:57.619
Hello?

12:57.620 --> 12:59.079
I'm sorry. One second.

12:59.080 --> 13:00.999
Don't forget to monitor...

13:01.000 --> 13:02.999
Oh, my God, please, please.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.169
Contacted anyone yet?

13:04.170 --> 13:06.039
What's wrong?

13:06.040 --> 13:07.789
Yes, we got ahold
of his parents.

13:07.790 --> 13:09.829
Sorry, ma'am.
We're calling to inform you

13:09.830 --> 13:11.709
that your husband
was in a car accident.

13:11.710 --> 13:12.959
W-What happened?
Where is he?

13:12.960 --> 13:14.829
Habour Hospital emergency room.

13:14.830 --> 13:16.119
He's going through surgery now.

13:16.120 --> 13:18.040
How bad is it?

13:52.830 --> 13:53.895
Miss Lucca Quinn.

13:53.896 --> 13:54.959
Yes?

13:54.960 --> 13:56.249
Would you accompany us, please?

13:56.250 --> 13:57.920
Why?

14:08.040 --> 14:09.709
What are you doing?

14:09.710 --> 14:12.169
We're detaining Miss Quinn
as a material witness.

14:12.170 --> 14:14.959
No, you're not.

14:14.960 --> 14:17.999
Uh, actually,
I don't know who you are,

14:18.000 --> 14:20.330
but yes, we are.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.249
Hold on, Lucca.

14:24.250 --> 14:26.330
She's gonna fuck you up.

14:56.790 --> 14:58.579
I can't go back to prison.

14:58.580 --> 14:59.420
I know.

14:59.421 --> 15:01.460
You have it?

15:02.880 --> 15:04.880
Yeah.

15:06.670 --> 15:08.540
- When?
- Tonight.

15:08.543 --> 15:11.499
I'll come for you at 8:00.

15:11.500 --> 15:13.500
Yeah.

15:17.420 --> 15:19.499
Hey, Henry.

15:19.500 --> 15:22.249
You can't say good-bye
to anyone.

15:22.250 --> 15:25.459
They can't know
it's a good-bye.

15:25.460 --> 15:28.080
8:00.

15:33.880 --> 15:35.379
Hello?

15:35.380 --> 15:36.619
Hey, babe, what are you doing?

15:36.620 --> 15:39.039
Working, Dad.
Can I call you back?

15:39.040 --> 15:41.249
Yeah. Maia, I was hoping

15:41.250 --> 15:43.329
you could come by
for dinner tonight.

15:43.330 --> 15:44.879
Ah, I mean, I'll try.

15:44.880 --> 15:46.789
Things are pretty crazy here.

15:46.790 --> 15:50.999
Well, I-it would mean a lot...
to your mom.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.379
We're thinking of, uh,
eating around 6:30.

15:53.380 --> 15:54.539
Okay.

15:54.540 --> 15:56.329
I might just be there
for dessert.

15:56.330 --> 15:59.209
Tell Mom like 8:30, 9:00.

15:59.210 --> 16:04.669
Um, actually, uh... a-are you
sure you can't come by earlier?

16:04.670 --> 16:08.039
Uh, Dad, I mean, I'll try,

16:08.040 --> 16:10.539
but, uh, look,
I got to go, okay?

16:10.540 --> 16:11.620
I'll call you back.

16:14.330 --> 16:16.329
Okay.

16:16.330 --> 16:17.539
Be safe, please.

16:17.540 --> 16:19.329
Okay. Bye.

16:19.330 --> 16:21.330
Bye.

16:29.330 --> 16:31.959
Wait, wait!

16:31.960 --> 16:33.879
We can argue this
at another time.

16:33.880 --> 16:37.079
The fact is, we took on the
client, we have his retainer,

16:37.080 --> 16:39.419
and the goal should be
to defend Lucca, yes?

16:39.420 --> 16:42.919
She's at the DOJ
and it's Dincon himself.

16:42.920 --> 16:45.249
Phil, call federal
court. Get us court time.

16:45.250 --> 16:46.499
What do the
Feds want anyhow?

16:46.500 --> 16:47.709
Who was here when
they took Lucca?

16:47.710 --> 16:48.960
I was.

16:50.960 --> 16:54.959
They want to know the identity
of Diane's client.

16:54.960 --> 16:57.419
Okay.
Lucca's friend screwed her.

16:57.420 --> 16:58.829
I'll take court.

16:58.830 --> 17:00.329
I'll argue
for a restraining order.

17:00.330 --> 17:01.619
They're trying to pierce
attorney-client privilege.

17:01.620 --> 17:02.959
I'll talk to the client.

17:02.960 --> 17:04.459
Maybe he's willing
to come forward,

17:04.460 --> 17:06.079
save us all the trouble.

17:06.079 --> 17:07.499
Where is Diane, anyhow?

17:07.500 --> 17:11.539
Sorry. Ah.

17:11.540 --> 17:13.419
Uh, Kurt McVeigh, please.

17:13.420 --> 17:15.420
I'm, uh, I'm his wife.

17:28.210 --> 17:29.419
Mrs. McVeigh?

17:29.420 --> 17:30.420
Oh, yes.

17:30.421 --> 17:31.829
He's out of surgery.

17:31.830 --> 17:33.119
Oh, I-is he okay?

17:33.120 --> 17:34.379
He should be.

17:34.380 --> 17:35.919
The doctor just needs
to run some tests,

17:35.920 --> 17:37.580
- but he should be fine.
- Well, what happened?

17:37.581 --> 17:39.379
There was an incident with a
car, some kind of carjacking.

17:39.380 --> 17:40.380
Can we get the
charge nurse, please?

17:40.381 --> 17:41.710
E-Excuse me.

17:50.380 --> 17:51.619
Diane?

17:51.620 --> 17:52.919
Oh.

17:52.920 --> 17:54.329
What are you doing here?

17:54.330 --> 17:56.169
Oh, my God. They called me.

17:56.170 --> 17:58.919
I'm-I'm... I'm your next of kin.

17:58.920 --> 18:00.620
- I told them no, it's nothing.
- Where are you going?

18:00.623 --> 18:02.000
- Get back into bed.
- I want to move around.

18:02.003 --> 18:03.579
No, this is serious.

18:03.580 --> 18:05.789
I mean, my God,
what happened?

18:05.790 --> 18:07.329
You were carjacked?

18:07.330 --> 18:08.379
No. Somebody else.

18:08.380 --> 18:09.749
I was knocked down.

18:09.750 --> 18:13.039
Kurt, you're not
20 years old anymore.

18:13.040 --> 18:14.539
Get back into bed.

18:19.460 --> 18:21.999
You look so grumpy.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.460
I had to delay my whole day.

18:26.500 --> 18:29.249
What were you calling
about this morning?

18:29.250 --> 18:32.039
What was I calling about?

18:32.040 --> 18:34.539
Yes. This morning.

18:34.540 --> 18:35.879
I forget.

18:35.880 --> 18:37.879
No. No, you didn't.

18:37.880 --> 18:39.500
Got hit in the head.

18:42.330 --> 18:45.289
Kurt, I thought
you were dead.

18:45.290 --> 18:46.580
I'm not.

18:48.500 --> 18:52.080
Don't do things that
put you in the hospital, okay?

18:54.040 --> 18:55.579
Okay.

19:00.080 --> 19:01.920
Oh, God.

19:01.923 --> 19:04.330
Sorry.

19:07.580 --> 19:11.000
I mean, it just never stops.

19:12.580 --> 19:15.579
Yeah. Gee, very
well, thank you.

19:15.580 --> 19:16.665
What the hell?!

19:16.666 --> 19:17.749
You undercut me, sir.

19:17.750 --> 19:19.499
Yeah. Get Judge
Kassovitz back on!

19:19.500 --> 19:22.289
An attorney came to me
asking for anonymity.

19:22.290 --> 19:23.749
You mean, your girlfriend?

19:23.750 --> 19:25.379
Sir, this is serious.

19:25.380 --> 19:27.169
It makes my position here
untenable.

19:27.170 --> 19:29.289
You didn't tell me
anything, Colin. I guessed.

19:29.290 --> 19:30.749
I <i>guessed </i> that you were
hiding your girlfriend.

19:30.750 --> 19:32.289
You tell her that.

19:32.290 --> 19:33.329
I'm resigning.

19:33.330 --> 19:34.919
No, you're being promoted.

19:34.920 --> 19:36.749
To Deputy.

19:36.750 --> 19:38.750
That's what you always
wanted anyway, right?

19:41.580 --> 19:44.499
Your Honor, this all comes down
to attorney-client privilege.

19:44.500 --> 19:46.499
Your Honor, you know
if I'm here,

19:46.500 --> 19:47.879
this is not
a routine matter.

19:47.880 --> 19:50.499
Uh, uh, why <i>are </i> you here, sir?

19:50.500 --> 19:52.499
Because this is about
cyber terrorism.

19:52.500 --> 19:53.709
No, this is about

19:53.710 --> 19:55.540
- the Sixth Amendment.
- Oh, God...

19:55.543 --> 19:57.539
They seized our attorney
and are holding her

19:57.540 --> 19:58.919
until she names our client.

19:58.920 --> 20:00.789
That is the definition
of governmental over...

20:00.790 --> 20:02.419
Okay, okay.

20:02.420 --> 20:03.499
On the record.

20:03.500 --> 20:05.419
What relief are
you seeking, Counselor?

20:05.420 --> 20:06.499
A temporary restraining order

20:06.500 --> 20:08.329
forcing
the Department of Justice

20:08.330 --> 20:09.749
to release
Lucca Quinn.

20:09.750 --> 20:11.960
And I'm granting such an order.

20:16.460 --> 20:19.379
What?

20:19.380 --> 20:20.460
Diane!

20:22.000 --> 20:24.169
When the fuck did that happen?

20:24.170 --> 20:25.789
What happened?

20:25.790 --> 20:27.419
We won the restraining order,

20:27.420 --> 20:29.209
so now they're
prosecuting Lucca.

20:29.210 --> 20:30.499
For what?

20:30.500 --> 20:32.749
And they got assigned
Judge Kassovitz.

20:32.750 --> 20:34.080
- Oh...
- Yeah.

20:34.081 --> 20:35.789
The most conservative
son of a bitch on the bench.

20:35.790 --> 20:36.790
They're venue shopping.

20:36.791 --> 20:38.879
Yeah. Uh...

20:38.880 --> 20:40.959
No, I'm coming in.

20:40.960 --> 20:42.540
I'll be there in 15 minutes.

20:47.750 --> 20:49.079
What's up?

20:49.080 --> 20:50.879
I'm tailing you.

20:50.880 --> 20:53.379
Today is not a
good day, Maia.

20:58.750 --> 21:01.539
Eh, come on, come on.
We'll do this tomorrow.

21:01.540 --> 21:04.079
You told me not to take
no for an answer.

21:04.080 --> 21:06.330
So, no, I'm coming.

21:11.960 --> 21:13.749
Sure, sure.

21:13.750 --> 21:15.750
Why not?

21:28.620 --> 21:31.379
Okay...

21:31.380 --> 21:33.209
What are you doing?

21:33.210 --> 21:35.250
- Oh...
- Put some lights on in here.

21:35.253 --> 21:38.079
You going out?

21:38.080 --> 21:40.169
To get my hair done.
Michael won't see me

21:40.170 --> 21:44.079
at the salon anymore,
but he does it at his home.

21:44.080 --> 21:46.379
Hey. Come here.

21:46.380 --> 21:49.830
Come here. Come here.

21:54.290 --> 21:56.329
I'll bring home dinner.

21:56.330 --> 21:58.080
I love you.

21:59.170 --> 22:02.829
Hey, Lenny.

22:02.830 --> 22:05.420
I'm glad I married you.

22:06.420 --> 22:08.959
Me, too.

22:08.960 --> 22:11.170
Mmm.

22:16.620 --> 22:18.379
Okay, buddy.

22:18.380 --> 22:20.669
One last walk.

22:20.670 --> 22:22.539
Okay, Maia,
watch what I do.

22:22.540 --> 22:24.079
Eye contact, always.

22:24.080 --> 22:26.079
Don't back down. Advance.

22:26.080 --> 22:29.330
Don't ever, ever,
ever retreat.

22:33.330 --> 22:34.419
Okay, where are we?

22:34.420 --> 22:37.459
Everybody sit down.

22:37.460 --> 22:38.829
This is an urgent matter, yes?

22:38.830 --> 22:40.419
The only thing that's urgent
here, Your Honor,

22:40.420 --> 22:43.169
is that we have a T.R.O.
from another judge's court.

22:43.170 --> 22:44.709
That is
the controlling interest...

22:44.710 --> 22:46.459
No, the urgency is
we have four hours

22:46.460 --> 22:49.289
to stop a cyber terrorism attack
on our power grid.

22:49.290 --> 22:51.709
Which Lucca Quinn has
nothing to do with.

22:51.710 --> 22:53.039
That's not true.

22:53.040 --> 22:54.960
- What?
- What's not true?

22:54.963 --> 22:57.539
We're charging Lucca Quinn
as a co-conspirator

22:57.540 --> 22:59.170
in cyber terrorism.

23:09.961 --> 23:11.249
Henry.

23:11.250 --> 23:14.329
Oh, hey. Hey, Rupert.

23:14.330 --> 23:15.709
What's up?

23:15.710 --> 23:17.419
We have to talk.

23:17.420 --> 23:19.419
Sure. You start.

23:19.420 --> 23:21.209
The prosecutor
called again.

23:21.210 --> 23:24.539
He did offer you one trade
for taking the 35 years.

23:24.540 --> 23:26.789
Yeah, what's that?

23:26.790 --> 23:28.999
A nice view?

23:29.000 --> 23:30.830
They have something
on Maia.

23:31.920 --> 23:34.959
She was offered a proffer.

23:34.960 --> 23:37.249
She shared what she knew,
which wasn't that much,

23:37.250 --> 23:40.250
but they caught her in a lie.
She perjured herself.

23:41.250 --> 23:43.789
Well...

23:43.790 --> 23:46.329
why didn't they tell
us that before? Why...

23:46.330 --> 23:47.710
It just happened
last week.

23:49.330 --> 23:51.999
Okay,
what's the offer?

23:52.000 --> 23:54.709
You take the 35 years,
they won't prosecute her.

23:56.710 --> 24:00.330
And how much could
she get for perjury?

24:02.920 --> 24:04.619
If they wanted to be tough...

24:04.620 --> 24:07.499
I think, given the popular will,
they might...

24:07.500 --> 24:09.540
five years.

24:19.380 --> 24:21.209
Hey...

24:24.210 --> 24:26.790
What do you want to do, Henry?

24:28.210 --> 24:29.499
<i>Look,</i>

24:29.500 --> 24:31.499
I am not going away
for 20 years, okay?

24:31.500 --> 24:32.789
I didn't do anything.

24:32.790 --> 24:34.419
Then you <i>won't
</i> go away.

24:34.420 --> 24:35.789
We're your lawyers.
We will defend you.

24:35.790 --> 24:38.499
But Lucca Quinn is being
held as your co-conspirator.

24:38.500 --> 24:41.329
But it's not in my interests
to put my name forward.

24:41.330 --> 24:43.499
The Feds didn't go
for the immunity offer, right?

24:43.500 --> 24:44.919
They're looking
for a scapegoat?

24:44.920 --> 24:46.670
Okay, so you didn't do it,
right?

24:47.790 --> 24:48.999
All right.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.539
You have any idea who did?

24:50.540 --> 24:52.669
My guess is
it's someone on 4chan.

24:52.670 --> 24:54.499
There's a group of us outsiders

24:54.500 --> 24:56.710
who joked about hacks
on the infrastructure.

24:57.880 --> 24:59.619
Okay, so everybody
is anonymous.

24:59.620 --> 25:01.879
Right.
So how do we find out who?

25:01.880 --> 25:04.419
Who do you most suspect?

25:04.420 --> 25:06.919
Well, the person I argued
politics with the most

25:06.920 --> 25:08.709
was Edict776.

25:08.710 --> 25:10.459
He kept trying to
change the hacking talk

25:10.460 --> 25:12.079
from a joke
to a reality.

25:12.080 --> 25:13.750
- You don't know his real name?
- No.

25:13.753 --> 25:15.709
And if he's as
smart as his hacks,

25:15.710 --> 25:17.999
he's buried his
tracks pretty deeply.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.289
Here he is...
Edict776.

25:20.290 --> 25:22.080
We keep saying "he."
Maybe he's a "she."

25:23.420 --> 25:25.959
Wow. That was surly.

25:25.960 --> 25:28.919
I'll funnel his postings
through this forensic software

25:28.920 --> 25:31.210
for grammar recognition.

25:36.380 --> 25:37.919
Okay, that's useless.
Did-did this guy

25:37.920 --> 25:39.579
ever talk about posting
on other sites?

25:39.580 --> 25:41.119
If we could
cross-reference it...

25:41.120 --> 25:44.079
Not to me.

25:44.080 --> 25:45.879
Wait.

25:45.880 --> 25:48.079
Go for Marissa.

25:48.080 --> 25:49.959
Yeah, I'll send him.

25:49.960 --> 25:51.709
Diane wants to talk to you.

25:51.710 --> 25:53.749
Oh.

25:53.750 --> 25:56.210
Keep me in touch.

25:58.750 --> 26:00.539
Did you just
make up that phone call?

26:00.540 --> 26:02.789
I don't trust him,
and it looked like

26:02.790 --> 26:04.539
you were onto
something. Were you?

26:04.540 --> 26:06.579
Yeah, a few screens back.
What'd he do to you?

26:06.580 --> 26:08.209
He's this genius hacker,

26:08.210 --> 26:09.789
and he hasn't done
what you're doing now?

26:09.790 --> 26:11.669
I mean, I think you're
smart and everything,

26:11.670 --> 26:13.879
but he hasn't run it
through forensic software?

26:13.880 --> 26:16.039
You are pretty good at this.

26:16.040 --> 26:18.289
Yeah, I told you, I'm
coming after your job.

26:19.311 --> 26:20.329
So what is it?

26:20.330 --> 26:23.579
This posting from
Edict776. Read it.

26:23.580 --> 26:26.959
"Sometimes I think
we need a surgical holocaust.

26:26.960 --> 26:28.460
Just kill the irritating..."

26:29.750 --> 26:32.379
We know him.

26:32.380 --> 26:34.540
No hate, no speech. No hate, no speech.

26:34.543 --> 26:35.935
Get back!
Get back!

26:35.936 --> 26:37.329
Fuck the old way!

26:37.330 --> 26:39.379
No, hate, no speech!
No hate, no speech!

26:40.381 --> 26:41.380
This way.
Through here.

26:41.381 --> 26:44.000
No hate, no speech! No hate, no speech!

26:44.003 --> 26:45.960
- He's the hacker?
- We think so.

26:45.963 --> 26:47.379
Why won't he talk to you two?

26:47.380 --> 26:48.460
I'm black.

26:48.461 --> 26:49.539
I'm Jewish.

26:49.540 --> 26:51.460
- Oh, dear God.
- Hey, sucks!

26:51.463 --> 26:52.565
We don't want the old way!

26:52.566 --> 26:53.669
This way, this way.

26:58.420 --> 27:00.289
No speech, no hate!

27:00.290 --> 27:03.499
No speech, no hate!
No speech, no hate!

27:03.500 --> 27:05.079
No speech, no hate!

27:05.080 --> 27:08.419
No speech, no hate!
No speech, no hate!

27:08.420 --> 27:09.460
Mother.

27:09.463 --> 27:12.079
Did you come to hear my speech?

27:12.080 --> 27:15.289
I don't think anyone's here
to hear your speech.

27:15.290 --> 27:16.539
I know. Isn't
it great?

27:16.540 --> 27:19.329
All those people,
so angry and excited.

27:19.330 --> 27:20.959
I'm the best thing
that ever happened to them.

27:20.960 --> 27:22.749
And they got to
pay me either way.

27:22.750 --> 27:25.459
Are you Edict776?

27:25.460 --> 27:27.169
Diane, where are
the pleasantries?

27:27.170 --> 27:29.289
I've been living a
very full life lately.

27:29.290 --> 27:30.669
So I've read.

27:30.670 --> 27:32.619
Your joke
about dead children?

27:32.620 --> 27:35.120
- Hasn't been going well for you.
- Really?

27:35.121 --> 27:36.749
Well, I think it's been
going spectacularly.

27:36.750 --> 27:39.539
I'm trending on Twitter
ten days in a row.

27:39.540 --> 27:41.829
How much have you been trending
the last few weeks?

27:43.830 --> 27:46.539
It's an odd attitude for
someone who needs my help.

27:46.540 --> 27:48.685
Is this hack yours?

27:48.686 --> 27:50.829
What, the hack on the
power grid? Diane, no.

27:50.830 --> 27:52.289
I've been reading
your posts on 4chan.

27:52.290 --> 27:53.619
Sure sounds like yours.

27:53.620 --> 27:55.959
I am a leader.
I inspire.

27:55.960 --> 27:57.709
But you do want
this power grid to go down?

27:57.710 --> 27:59.459
Well, who doesn't
love a blackout?

27:59.460 --> 28:01.539
You get to light
candles, fuck a stranger,

28:01.540 --> 28:05.459
loot an Apple store, make Rahm
Emanuel look like an asshole.

28:05.460 --> 28:07.499
So this is about
embarrassing the Democrats?

28:07.500 --> 28:11.079
No. I mean, that's great,
too, but, no. It's...

28:11.080 --> 28:13.789
It's about
disruption.

28:13.790 --> 28:16.329
We love it in the tech world.
Why not in the real one?

28:16.330 --> 28:19.539
But again, this
is not my hack.

28:19.540 --> 28:21.579
Yes, I encouraged someone,
but legally, I did nothing.

28:21.580 --> 28:23.749
Who have you encouraged?
Do you know his name?

28:23.750 --> 28:24.770
No. I know his handle.

28:24.771 --> 28:25.790
Listen...

28:28.960 --> 28:30.335
We need your help, Mr. Staples.

28:30.336 --> 28:31.709
Diane.

28:31.710 --> 28:34.789
There's nothing I'd rather do
than help you,

28:34.790 --> 28:37.379
after all
we've been through,

28:37.380 --> 28:40.379
but I-I have legal troubles
of my own.

28:40.380 --> 28:43.999
They occupy my days,
they interrupt my nights.

28:44.000 --> 28:45.579
What legal troubles?

28:45.580 --> 28:47.539
Where should I begin?

28:47.540 --> 28:48.749
...guess who
the victim is?

28:48.750 --> 28:50.539
There were several speaking
engagements canceled.

28:50.540 --> 28:51.789
I'd like you to
sue them, too.

28:51.790 --> 28:53.789
You know, I can't sue
all of them.

28:53.790 --> 28:55.120
We'll prioritize.

28:56.620 --> 28:59.419
You do realize you made a joke
about school shootings?

28:59.420 --> 29:01.209
Yes, but I didn't commit
a school shooting,

29:01.210 --> 29:03.709
no matter how annoying my gender
studies professors were.

29:03.710 --> 29:05.459
There was nothing
in those contracts

29:05.460 --> 29:07.329
about what I can say
and what I can't.

29:07.330 --> 29:09.619
All right, let's move on
to the next issue. My issue.

29:09.620 --> 29:11.249
What is the screen name

29:11.250 --> 29:12.880
- of the hacker?
- Oh, him.

29:12.883 --> 29:13.919
Or her.

29:13.920 --> 29:16.459
Or they.

29:16.460 --> 29:17.625
Tarr19.

29:17.626 --> 29:18.789
All right.

29:18.790 --> 29:21.119
And you will go online
and ask him or her

29:21.120 --> 29:22.829
to meet
about the blackout tonight?

29:22.830 --> 29:24.120
- I might.
- No.

29:24.123 --> 29:25.459
One for you,
and one for me.

29:25.460 --> 29:27.669
Okay, the first for me
is to sue my radio show.

29:27.670 --> 29:29.829
Those bitches left me
high and dry!

29:29.830 --> 29:33.289
Now, I will get on it.
Now you get on it, too.

29:33.290 --> 29:35.079
You guys would make
a great cop show.

29:35.080 --> 29:36.789
<i>Mr. Brown and Fran.</i>

29:36.790 --> 29:38.209
Thanks.

29:38.210 --> 29:39.620
Good one.

29:41.080 --> 29:42.499
Diane, did you get in touch
with your husband?

29:42.500 --> 29:44.579
No. I mean, yes. Why?

29:44.580 --> 29:46.420
- Did you see him on YouTube?
- No.

29:46.423 --> 29:48.120
- What do you mean?
- Very sexy video.

29:48.123 --> 29:50.420
You should look it up.

30:25.540 --> 30:27.539
<i>Your Honor,</i>

30:27.540 --> 30:30.119
this is a trick to get around
the restraining order.

30:30.120 --> 30:31.829
We ask for immediate relief.

30:31.830 --> 30:33.829
I wish it were,
Your Honor.

30:33.830 --> 30:36.249
But Lucca Quinn is
a co-conspirator,

30:36.250 --> 30:38.619
and we ask that we be allowed
to present testimony

30:38.620 --> 30:40.499
to support
this contention.

30:40.500 --> 30:42.119
How long
is it gonna take?

30:42.120 --> 30:44.119
The witness is
right here now.

30:44.120 --> 30:45.709
Let's go.

30:45.710 --> 30:49.539
You had a meeting
with Lucca Quinn,

30:49.540 --> 30:52.539
did you not,
Mr. AUSA?

30:52.540 --> 30:53.829
I did.

30:53.830 --> 30:55.419
And what did
she give you?

30:55.420 --> 30:56.789
A flash drive.

30:56.790 --> 30:58.709
Did it look like this?

30:58.710 --> 31:00.419
It did.

31:00.420 --> 31:01.829
And when we inserted

31:01.830 --> 31:03.459
this flash drive
into our computers,

31:03.460 --> 31:04.460
what happened?

31:05.461 --> 31:08.500
It introduced the malware
into our system.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.460
Thus bypassing
our firewall?

31:14.580 --> 31:16.119
Yes.

31:16.120 --> 31:17.959
But Ms. Quinn intended...

31:17.960 --> 31:20.959
Thank you, Mr. AUSA.

31:20.960 --> 31:22.419
Mr. AUSA,

31:22.420 --> 31:25.499
let's really get
down to it here.

31:25.500 --> 31:26.789
Are you Ms. Quinn's ex-lover?

31:26.790 --> 31:28.499
Objection, Your Honor.

31:28.500 --> 31:30.210
- Relevance.
- Goes to motive, Your Honor.

31:30.213 --> 31:32.289
Sure. Go see
what you can do with it.

31:32.290 --> 31:33.879
Objection overruled.

31:33.880 --> 31:35.119
Thank you.

31:35.120 --> 31:38.119
Are you
her ex-lover?

31:38.120 --> 31:39.330
Yes.

31:39.331 --> 31:40.539
I'm sorry,
I can't hear you.

31:40.540 --> 31:42.289
Yes.

31:42.290 --> 31:43.879
And did
she break up with you?

31:43.880 --> 31:45.079
I would guess

31:45.080 --> 31:48.329
it was... mutual.

31:48.330 --> 31:49.330
You would guess.

31:49.331 --> 31:51.499
Since you're
in a guessing mode,

31:51.500 --> 31:53.499
would you also guess that your
whole testimony is an attempt

31:53.500 --> 31:55.459
by you to get back at the woman
who broke up with you?!

31:55.460 --> 31:57.380
- Objection.
- Seriously,

31:57.383 --> 31:59.079
you're using
my client's ex-lover

31:59.080 --> 32:00.329
to put her in jail,

32:00.330 --> 32:01.960
- and you're objecting to the fact
- Stop.

32:01.963 --> 32:03.289
that I am establishing

32:03.290 --> 32:04.500
- that his whole motivation is...
- Stop!

32:04.503 --> 32:05.709
That's enough.

32:05.710 --> 32:07.379
You've done enough damage
to the witness.

32:07.380 --> 32:09.419
If you have
any more questions, ask them.

32:09.420 --> 32:12.830
No, Your Honor, but I would
like an answer to my question.

32:16.880 --> 32:18.879
Mr. AUSA?

32:18.880 --> 32:22.079
Would you like to lean in
so you could hear me clearly?

32:22.080 --> 32:23.579
I can hear you
just fine.

32:23.580 --> 32:25.460
I'd like His Honor to hear you.

32:28.380 --> 32:32.040
I'm telling you the truth.

32:33.420 --> 32:35.419
Are you using us?

32:35.420 --> 32:37.000
Excuse me?

32:37.001 --> 32:38.579
I said,
are you using us?

32:38.580 --> 32:40.379
I just came from court
where they presented evidence

32:40.380 --> 32:43.419
that that flash drive he gave us
is a Trojan horse.

32:43.420 --> 32:45.080
- What?
- Yeah, it's infected.

32:45.083 --> 32:47.419
And he used us to get it past
the government firewall.

32:47.420 --> 32:50.459
The malware needed
to infect a DOJ computer,

32:50.460 --> 32:51.855
and you used us to do it!

32:51.856 --> 32:53.249
No. No.

32:53.250 --> 32:55.959
Yes! I don't believe you.

32:55.960 --> 32:57.419
It doesn't matter.
I'm your client.

32:57.420 --> 32:58.620
- We're firing you.
- You can't.

32:58.623 --> 33:00.460
- And I'm not firing you.
- My firm.

33:00.463 --> 33:03.039
You're fired. Get your ass out.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.579
Ahem.

33:08.580 --> 33:10.579
Was, uh, that
just an act?

33:10.580 --> 33:13.289
Little bit.

33:13.290 --> 33:15.169
What do you think?

33:15.170 --> 33:17.670
- Even if it's true, we're stuck.
- Lucca's stuck.

33:17.673 --> 33:20.169
Let me see if I can use
Felix to get somewhere.

33:20.170 --> 33:22.289
No, we're actually using
Felix ourselves.

33:22.290 --> 33:24.080
You need to wait on that.

33:24.083 --> 33:26.879
Ex-Excuse me.

33:26.880 --> 33:29.119
Maia, yeah, what's up?

33:29.120 --> 33:30.379
We're back in session.

33:30.380 --> 33:32.119
What? They said an hour.

33:32.120 --> 33:33.310
You joining us, miss?

33:33.311 --> 33:34.499
Uh, yes,

33:34.500 --> 33:36.169
Your Honor. One second.

33:36.170 --> 33:38.329
They can't beat me,
so they're squeezing me out.

33:38.330 --> 33:41.329
All right, look, you start
with the rebuttal witness.

33:41.330 --> 33:43.079
I'll be right there.
Can you do that?

33:43.080 --> 33:44.669
Yes. Of course.

33:44.670 --> 33:46.079
Good.

33:46.080 --> 33:48.379
You get angry and you focus.

33:48.380 --> 33:51.709
Angry and you focus. All right?

33:51.710 --> 33:53.749
I'm pissed.

33:53.750 --> 33:56.500
I believe you.

33:58.170 --> 34:02.879
Thank you for answering
questions today, Mr. Staple.

34:02.880 --> 34:04.879
Actually, that's two staples,
not one.

34:04.880 --> 34:06.329
It's like a high-end magazine.

34:08.040 --> 34:11.498
Do you know that Ms. Quinn

34:11.500 --> 34:14.119
is not a co-conspirator
to this malware?

34:14.120 --> 34:15.748
Yes, I do not.

34:15.750 --> 34:18.329
You do not?

34:18.330 --> 34:20.498
Yes, I do know that she is not.

34:20.500 --> 34:23.619
Uh, and, uh,

34:23.620 --> 34:25.619
how do you know that?

34:25.620 --> 34:29.458
Well, I-I feel that I could
best illustrate the answer

34:29.460 --> 34:30.748
with a song.

34:30.750 --> 34:32.000
- Objection.
- ♪ I don't know ♪

34:32.003 --> 34:34.539
♪ Why it ain't... ♪

34:34.540 --> 34:36.918
You're not singing
in my courtroom, sir.

34:36.920 --> 34:39.329
Mr. Staples, are you
in touch with the real hacker?

34:39.330 --> 34:40.708
I am.

34:40.710 --> 34:43.329
Tell us how the
hack was devised.

34:43.330 --> 34:44.918
Just so we all understand,

34:44.920 --> 34:46.708
I am reporting
what the hacker said.

34:46.710 --> 34:48.418
I thought he was joking.

34:48.420 --> 34:50.379
But the hack was
devised in such a way

34:50.380 --> 34:54.789
as to trick an unwitting mule
such as Ms. Quinn

34:54.790 --> 34:56.498
into carrying it
on a flash drive

34:56.500 --> 34:59.419
and injecting it
into a governmental drive.

34:59.420 --> 35:01.039
So, as far
as you know,

35:01.040 --> 35:03.249
Ms. Quinn is innocent?

35:03.250 --> 35:04.749
As a fetus.

35:04.750 --> 35:06.379
Thank you.

35:06.380 --> 35:09.539
What did you say about the Jews

35:09.540 --> 35:11.210
- on 4chan?
- Oh, come on. Your Honor, objection.

35:11.213 --> 35:13.120
- Goes to bias, Your Honor.
- It does not.

35:13.123 --> 35:15.209
Well, maybe it goes
to Mr. Dincon's bias,

35:15.210 --> 35:17.040
- but not to the bias...
- Excuse me. A bit more respect.

35:17.043 --> 35:20.289
Why? You're the one trying to
slip something by His Honor.

35:20.290 --> 35:21.419
You see his culture
and religion

35:21.420 --> 35:22.770
and try to use that...

35:22.771 --> 35:24.119
I did not try to...

35:24.120 --> 35:26.539
You're all out of order!
I was simply satirizing!

35:26.540 --> 35:28.789
Shut up! Don't
say another word.

35:28.790 --> 35:32.419
Your Honor, this joker
is an anti-Semitic provocateur.

35:32.420 --> 35:34.669
No, he is not.
And-and this is just

35:34.670 --> 35:37.289
an amateurish attempt
to try and undermine

35:37.290 --> 35:38.789
some damaging testimony.

35:38.790 --> 35:40.579
What-what I find offensive

35:40.580 --> 35:43.420
is that you think the judge
could be so easily manipulated.

35:46.540 --> 35:48.829
She's right, Mr. Dincon.

35:48.830 --> 35:50.379
Go sit down.

35:50.380 --> 35:52.539
Your motion

35:52.540 --> 35:54.539
is sustained,
miss.

35:54.540 --> 35:55.920
Thank you, Your Honor.

35:59.330 --> 36:01.419
<i>- Thank you, Maia.
- I didn't want to push it,</i>

36:01.420 --> 36:03.539
but I really
wanted to see you.

36:03.540 --> 36:04.829
You seem emotional.

36:04.830 --> 36:06.249
And you seem happy.

36:06.250 --> 36:08.379
It was a good day.

36:08.380 --> 36:12.079
My two favorite people.

36:13.460 --> 36:15.879
Part of me wants
to take a picture of this.

36:15.880 --> 36:18.329
But the other part
just wants to remember it.

36:18.330 --> 36:20.119
Mmm.

36:20.120 --> 36:21.709
Will you guys excuse
me for a minute?

36:21.710 --> 36:23.329
I have to return
Rupert's call.

36:23.330 --> 36:25.329
I'll be right back.

36:30.540 --> 36:32.709
Rupert,

36:32.710 --> 36:34.499
I'll take the deal.

36:34.500 --> 36:37.499
The, uh, 35 years.

36:37.500 --> 36:39.669
I have one request.

36:39.670 --> 36:42.209
I want tonight with my family.

36:42.210 --> 36:43.879
I'll self-surrender
later tonight,

36:43.880 --> 36:46.290
but I want one last dinner.

36:52.380 --> 36:55.119
This is awful.

36:55.120 --> 36:58.919
I can feel the MSG
seeping into my pores.

36:58.920 --> 37:01.329
My guess is Tarr19 suggested it.

37:01.330 --> 37:03.539
And he and I are
supposed to be incognito.

37:03.540 --> 37:06.329
The only two Aryans in
a Chinese restaurant.

37:06.330 --> 37:09.579
Unless he's Chinese.

37:09.580 --> 37:12.459
Okay. I'm leaving you
and staying hidden.

37:12.460 --> 37:16.619
Just keep him talking for a
minute, until they intervene.

37:16.620 --> 37:19.250
Who's "they"?

37:54.000 --> 37:55.539
God, I feel a
certain chill.

37:55.540 --> 37:57.249
I feel dirty.

37:57.250 --> 37:58.879
You'll get it past the firewalls
in Los Angeles?

37:58.880 --> 38:01.209
Damn right. But I think
we should try Vegas.

38:01.210 --> 38:04.619
Right? A blackout there... Celine
clawing through the crowd...

38:04.620 --> 38:07.039
No, the key is big
financial centers.

38:07.040 --> 38:09.079
Vegas is a big
financial center.

38:09.080 --> 38:10.540
No, not in a way
that brings change.

38:12.750 --> 38:14.749
You're a Bernie Bro?

38:14.750 --> 38:16.499
Okay. We really
don't need to go there.

38:16.500 --> 38:19.289
We agree on the ends,
that's what matters.

38:19.290 --> 38:20.499
I supported Trump
because I thought the world

38:20.500 --> 38:22.079
would be more fun.

38:22.080 --> 38:23.459
You supported Trump
because, what?

38:23.460 --> 38:25.499
It would bring on
the revolution?

38:25.500 --> 38:27.329
Who's the bigger asshole?

38:27.330 --> 38:28.829
Are we working together or not?

38:28.830 --> 38:31.539
Probably... not.

38:33.750 --> 38:35.379
Excuse me, sir.

38:35.380 --> 38:36.499
Yeah, sorry.

38:36.500 --> 38:39.079
Next time try someone
trustworthy.

38:39.080 --> 38:41.709
You want to stand up so I can
read you your rights, please?

38:41.710 --> 38:43.460
Come on.

38:47.080 --> 38:48.080
You set me up.

38:48.081 --> 38:49.080
No.

38:49.081 --> 38:50.419
We're your lawyers.

38:50.420 --> 38:52.379
We didn't know
who would show up.

38:52.380 --> 38:53.709
Sir, you have the right
to remain silent.

38:53.710 --> 38:55.120
Anything you say can and will be

38:55.121 --> 38:56.539
used against you
in a court of law.

38:56.540 --> 38:58.459
You're representing me?

38:58.460 --> 39:00.829
Yes. And I would suggest
you remain silent.

39:00.830 --> 39:03.170
...one will be appointed for you.

39:04.316 --> 39:05.459
Oh. There it is.

39:05.460 --> 39:07.670
Right on time.

39:22.830 --> 39:25.669
Attention. Please stay calm

39:25.670 --> 39:28.709
and look for the
emergency exit signs.

39:28.710 --> 39:31.289
Do not run.
Walk slowly and carefully.

39:31.290 --> 39:33.499
I can take it
from here, Sal.

39:33.500 --> 39:35.209
Here's your cell.

39:35.210 --> 39:37.079
Go home.

39:37.080 --> 39:38.329
What happened?

39:38.330 --> 39:39.709
We caught the real hacker.

39:39.710 --> 39:41.670
A little late.

39:42.710 --> 39:44.749
Take care.

39:44.750 --> 39:47.289
Colin.

39:47.290 --> 39:49.250
Yeah.

39:50.420 --> 39:52.670
I know it wasn't you
that did this.

39:54.790 --> 39:57.669
Be careful out there, Lucca.

39:57.670 --> 40:00.210
It's nuts.

40:12.250 --> 40:13.999
It's beautiful, isn't it?

40:14.000 --> 40:16.709
Oh, I love this city.

40:16.710 --> 40:20.749
Sometimes it just feels like
the eighth Wonder, you know?

40:24.250 --> 40:25.539
I hear you did well.

40:25.540 --> 40:28.289
Yeah. Lucca's free.

40:28.290 --> 40:29.669
And you did well, too.

40:29.670 --> 40:31.419
Mm.

40:32.830 --> 40:34.289
There's a <i>whole
</i> lot of people

40:34.290 --> 40:36.750
want to see this
country fail, Diane.

40:38.880 --> 40:40.669
Are you talking
about our clients?

40:40.670 --> 40:42.879
Not just.

40:42.880 --> 40:46.669
It's a grim time
out there.

40:46.670 --> 40:48.709
And weird.

40:50.620 --> 40:54.039
It feels like something's
come detached.

40:54.040 --> 40:55.619
You know, like a
piece of machinery

40:55.620 --> 40:57.080
that doesn't sound right?

40:59.290 --> 41:00.789
So what do we do?

41:00.790 --> 41:02.459
The same thing we're doing.

41:02.460 --> 41:06.119
The only constant is the law.

41:06.120 --> 41:10.119
Everybody running around out
there doing God knows what.

41:10.120 --> 41:13.670
The only constant we have
is the law.

41:16.830 --> 41:19.539
I'm glad I'm here, Adrian.

41:19.540 --> 41:23.329
I'm glad you're
here, too, Diane.

I'll get it.

41:53.620 --> 41:55.709
Thank you, Maia.

41:55.710 --> 41:57.579
For what?

41:57.580 --> 42:00.119
Not judging us,
not judging me.

42:00.120 --> 42:02.209
Do you love Dad?

42:04.750 --> 42:08.619
We had troubles and, um...

42:08.620 --> 42:10.749
we never wanted to bother you

42:10.750 --> 42:13.210
with them, but, um...

42:15.710 --> 42:18.619
Yes, I love your dad.

42:18.620 --> 42:22.829
This will be a hard time.

42:22.830 --> 42:24.000
The trial?

42:25.710 --> 42:27.960
No.

42:30.790 --> 42:34.209
Your father's agreed
to a 35-year plea.

42:34.210 --> 42:36.459
What?

42:36.460 --> 42:39.079
When?

42:39.080 --> 42:43.579
Tonight. That's why he
called you to come home.

42:43.580 --> 42:46.669
- You've got it.
- I'll be outside in two minutes.

42:46.670 --> 42:48.079
Dad. No.

42:48.080 --> 42:49.789
You need to fight this.
What are you doing?

42:49.790 --> 42:52.249
Please, Maia.

42:52.250 --> 42:54.170
- I can't.
- You can.

42:54.173 --> 42:56.579
They're acting tough,
but what do they have?

42:56.580 --> 42:57.810
I saw the evidence.

42:57.811 --> 42:59.039
What evidence?

42:59.040 --> 43:02.379
Dad, I spent today thinking
I was overwhelmed by evidence.

43:02.380 --> 43:03.829
But with a good argument...

43:03.830 --> 43:05.380
I'm guilty.

43:16.710 --> 43:18.380
I did it.

43:21.750 --> 43:23.749
No. Jax did.

43:23.750 --> 43:25.709
Yes.

43:25.710 --> 43:27.919
And I did it, too.

43:27.920 --> 43:30.829
And your mom...

43:30.830 --> 43:32.669
and everyone.

43:32.670 --> 43:35.249
Everyone knew.

43:35.250 --> 43:38.289
We paid off the SEC.

43:38.290 --> 43:41.290
We paid off anyone
who got suspicious.

43:47.790 --> 43:50.580
That's Rupert.

43:55.880 --> 43:58.249
I'm...

43:58.250 --> 44:03.169
I am so sorry

44:03.170 --> 44:04.670
to disappoint you.

44:05.710 --> 44:07.670
I'm so sorry.

44:09.710 --> 44:12.620
You never could.

44:29.250 --> 44:31.750
I love you.

44:48.170 --> 44:49.789
You ready?

44:49.790 --> 44:51.379
Yeah.

44:51.380 --> 44:53.790
Let's go.

45:01.790 --> 45:04.169
So you're a hero.

45:06.170 --> 45:07.829
I saw it.

45:07.830 --> 45:09.619
The video.

45:09.620 --> 45:11.829
Okay. It's... let's not.

45:11.830 --> 45:14.289
What? I was talking to you

45:14.290 --> 45:18.249
like you were eight years old
and you're...

45:18.250 --> 45:19.375
you're Sully or something.

45:19.376 --> 45:20.499
Diane, please.

45:20.500 --> 45:23.209
I don't like it
when people...

45:23.210 --> 45:25.119
make a big deal.

45:25.120 --> 45:27.000
Oh.

45:28.500 --> 45:30.669
I represent unscrupulous people,

45:30.670 --> 45:33.539
and you...

45:33.540 --> 45:35.709
you save children.

45:35.710 --> 45:37.880
You...

45:45.120 --> 45:48.330
I was calling you
to ask you to dinner.

46:10.120 --> 46:11.749
Are you sure
you'll be all right?

46:11.750 --> 46:14.079
Yeah, I'm fine.

46:14.080 --> 46:16.079
Come in.
Stay the night.

46:16.080 --> 46:18.790
Don't drive back
to the city.

46:24.580 --> 46:26.710
I love you.

46:28.750 --> 46:30.919
I was so hurt.

46:30.920 --> 46:33.829
I know.

46:33.830 --> 46:36.210
It won't happen again.

46:37.540 --> 46:40.119
Stay. I'll light a fire.

My convict.

47:32.710 --> 47:33.879
My lawyer.

47:33.880 --> 47:35.829
Who fucking killed
it in court.

47:35.830 --> 47:37.209
Ah, thank you.

47:37.210 --> 47:38.709
Wow.

47:38.710 --> 47:41.459
Looks like a soft-porn
movie in here.

47:41.460 --> 47:43.419
Well, I do my best.

47:43.420 --> 47:44.789
Where's Amy?

47:44.790 --> 47:45.999
She's on her way home.

47:46.000 --> 47:47.709
We'll have to eat
cold mac and cheese.

47:47.710 --> 47:48.749
Oh, I love cold
mac and cheese.

47:48.750 --> 47:49.879
Mmm, good.

47:49.880 --> 47:51.579
You still worried
about your job?

47:51.580 --> 47:53.419
Hmm. I'm always worried.

47:53.420 --> 47:56.249
It was crazy coming here,
like a street party.

47:56.250 --> 47:58.579
Yeah. I kind of
liked it, though.

47:58.580 --> 48:00.170
- Yeah.
- Mmm.

48:00.173 --> 48:02.040
To a weird three months.

48:03.710 --> 48:05.960
Yes.

48:07.170 --> 48:08.580
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

48:08.583 --> 48:09.879
This is what I think.

48:09.880 --> 48:11.670
- Want to hear?
- Yeah.

48:11.673 --> 48:14.669
I think for every
weird three months,

48:14.670 --> 48:16.169
there are three normal months.

48:16.170 --> 48:18.879
I mean, the world has
to live in balance, right?

48:18.880 --> 48:21.829
So, I mean, my guess is
the next three months

48:21.830 --> 48:23.960
will be boring.

48:24.960 --> 48:27.829
To boring.

48:27.830 --> 48:30.379
Was everything
okay with Colin?

48:30.380 --> 48:33.249
Not really.

48:33.250 --> 48:36.789
But to boring, right?

48:36.790 --> 48:39.289
Right.

48:41.290 --> 48:44.750
Mmm. Amy forgot
her keys again.

48:46.290 --> 48:48.039
Uh, Maia.

48:48.040 --> 48:49.669
Thank you.

48:49.670 --> 48:51.379
Hey.

48:51.380 --> 48:53.750
Dinner is going
to be cold.

48:55.750 --> 48:57.119
Maia Rindell.

48:57.120 --> 48:59.119
Come on, we finished.

48:59.120 --> 49:00.579
No.

49:00.580 --> 49:01.830
Your dad fled.

49:03.120 --> 49:05.710
You're under arrest.
