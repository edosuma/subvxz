WEBVTT

00:03.502 --> 00:07.382
What?
Just... don't.

00:07.513 --> 00:08.912
What is wrong with you?

00:08.913 --> 00:11.872
I wanted to tell you.

00:11.873 --> 00:13.912
But I didn't think you'd understand.

00:13.913 --> 00:16.111
- Someone stole it from me.
- They stole it?

00:16.113 --> 00:18.952
A girl... A bloke...

00:18.953 --> 00:21.472
A transgender bloke.

00:21.473 --> 00:23.512
She wanted to be a man.

00:23.513 --> 00:24.712
She had a power.

00:24.713 --> 00:26.112
Nadine.
I'm Rudy.

00:26.113 --> 00:28.152
Is that the right time?
Eh?

00:28.153 --> 00:29.272
I have to go.

00:29.273 --> 00:30.512
No, don't go.

00:30.513 --> 00:33.072
Please...

00:33.073 --> 00:35.552
I can't stop thinking about her.

00:35.553 --> 00:36.753
I didn't know you were coming.

00:36.754 --> 00:38.712
Yeah, Jess asked me.

00:38.713 --> 00:40.552
Is that all right with you?

00:40.553 --> 00:42.432
Absolutely fine.

00:42.433 --> 00:45.872
I know you'd rather spend the evening
talking to Mr HIV over there.

00:45.873 --> 00:47.432
Can we not do this tonight?

00:51.073 --> 00:55.072
I'm Abbey, by the way.

00:57.000 --> 01:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:12.673 --> 02:16.672
I want you to get back out there.

02:18.193 --> 02:21.032
I'll double your money,
whatever it takes.

02:21.033 --> 02:25.032
Just find my cock!

03:12.393 --> 03:13.472
No.

03:13.473 --> 03:16.592
Dude, no, I'm not feeling it.
It's like I'm fucking numb.

03:16.593 --> 03:18.832
It's like I'm paralysed from me cock
down over here.

03:18.833 --> 03:20.992
Ssh!

03:20.993 --> 03:24.312
Listen, oi, you know me,
usually I'd be all over that.

03:24.313 --> 03:27.152
This used to be me favourite bit.

03:27.153 --> 03:29.912
Look at 'em all, stretching out
their fannies, all nice and wide

03:29.913 --> 03:31.632
with their big, swollen milky tits.

03:31.633 --> 03:34.712
You know, their vaginae,
they have an expiry date, mate.

03:34.713 --> 03:37.393
You've got to get one last taste
of that fruit before it goes off.

03:37.394 --> 03:38.954
Do you understand what I'm telling you?

03:38.955 --> 03:42.312
There's nothing worse than
a mouldy piece of fruit.

03:42.313 --> 03:43.712
Especially peaches.

03:43.713 --> 03:46.272
But now, I'm not even interested,
to be honest with you.

03:46.273 --> 03:47.792
I'll tell you why.

03:47.793 --> 03:49.432
Do you know why?

03:49.433 --> 03:53.432
The girl from last night, Nadine,
I can't get her out of me mind.

03:53.953 --> 03:55.672
What's it all about, really?

03:55.673 --> 03:57.672
I think it means you really like her.

03:57.673 --> 03:59.112
Fuck off!

03:59.113 --> 04:03.112
We should get started.
Mm.

04:11.673 --> 04:13.112
Right, now then.

04:13.113 --> 04:15.912
Prime example about
the whole Nadine thing, right?

04:15.913 --> 04:18.872
Passed-out girl on the floor,
good-looking girl, normally I...

04:18.873 --> 04:21.712
would be thinking...

04:21.713 --> 04:24.632
balls on face.

04:24.633 --> 04:26.392
But nothing.
Balls on face?

04:26.393 --> 04:29.392
Yeah. Dude, but not in a bloody
creepy way, mate.

04:29.393 --> 04:33.192
In a... you know, like...
'Ey, dude...

04:33.193 --> 04:36.232
let's put our balls on each other's
faces.

04:36.233 --> 04:40.232
For banter, though. Funny.

04:40.393 --> 04:41.592
Hello.

04:41.593 --> 04:45.592
Morning.

04:52.233 --> 04:53.592
Yes!

04:53.593 --> 04:57.592
Respect, straight back on it.

05:04.793 --> 05:05.952
Who the fuck are you?

05:05.953 --> 05:07.432
Abbey.

05:07.433 --> 05:10.112
Who the fuck are you?

05:10.113 --> 05:12.792
What's she doing here?

05:12.793 --> 05:13.832
Did you fuck her?

05:13.833 --> 05:14.952
Is that what happened?

05:14.953 --> 05:16.112
No!

05:16.113 --> 05:18.952
Did you fuck her in here?

05:18.953 --> 05:22.432
The smell of the sweat and the feel
of cold, hard tiles on your knees.

05:22.433 --> 05:23.592
I didn't touch her.

05:23.593 --> 05:24.552
Better not have.

05:24.553 --> 05:27.272
What's she doing here?

05:27.273 --> 05:30.712
She's on community service.

05:30.713 --> 05:32.112
Well, no-one told me.

05:32.113 --> 05:36.112
Yeah, well, I'm telling you now.

05:36.353 --> 05:39.272
You're responsible for her.

05:39.273 --> 05:41.032
If she fucks up, you fuck up,

05:41.033 --> 05:43.992
and I'll fuck you up all the way
to fuck.

05:43.993 --> 05:45.072
How is that fair?

05:45.073 --> 05:49.072
You can start by cleaning the shit
out of the community centre.

05:49.153 --> 05:52.672
Have fun.

05:52.673 --> 05:54.952
What's all that about?

05:54.953 --> 05:56.592
That is our...

05:56.593 --> 05:58.752
that is our probation worker.

05:58.753 --> 06:01.552
He's bloody highly strung
and he's very angry

06:01.553 --> 06:04.712
and I just think there's a lot of
pain there, to be honest with you.

06:04.713 --> 06:07.512
Well, good luck with it all.

06:07.513 --> 06:09.312
What are you doing?
You heard what he said,

06:09.313 --> 06:11.512
he's going to fuck me up
all the way to fuck.

06:11.513 --> 06:15.472
And... I don't even know what that
means, but it's not good.

06:15.473 --> 06:16.872
That's your problem.

06:16.873 --> 06:19.112
Please just help us out for today.

06:19.113 --> 06:22.232
I'll sort something out, I'll get
you out of it, I'll...

06:22.233 --> 06:24.552
I'll fake your death.

06:24.553 --> 06:28.552
Where do I get a jumpsuit?

06:31.233 --> 06:32.312
Ah, yes.

06:32.313 --> 06:36.312
Yes, there.

06:43.353 --> 06:44.832
Oh, hello!

06:44.833 --> 06:48.832
Do I detect the gentle flush
of the female orgasm?

06:50.873 --> 06:53.312
Fuck off.

06:53.313 --> 06:55.032
So is that it then?

06:55.033 --> 06:56.752
You and Alex, are you together?

06:56.753 --> 06:58.592
Boyfriend and girlfriend?

06:58.593 --> 07:01.352
Yeah, Finn.
We swapped friendship bracelets

07:01.353 --> 07:05.352
and then we went to the cinema
and he touched me up.

07:09.633 --> 07:11.312
Are you on community service?

07:11.313 --> 07:15.312
No. Just pretending.

07:23.513 --> 07:26.352
I just... I don't understand
whether I'm...

07:26.353 --> 07:28.872
whether I'm just thinking about her
because...

07:28.873 --> 07:31.872
you know, like I know
I'm never going to see her again.

07:31.873 --> 07:35.872
Like when you go to a vending machine
and there's no prawn cocktail crisps,

07:35.873 --> 07:37.352
and all you want is a packet...

07:37.353 --> 07:38.792
of prawn cocktail crisps.

07:38.793 --> 07:40.312
Exactly that, man.

07:40.313 --> 07:43.832
Exactly that.

07:43.833 --> 07:47.832
Fuck, now all I can think about is
prawn cocktail crisps, knob-head.

07:49.353 --> 07:53.352
Mmm.

07:55.953 --> 07:58.432
Yeah, no, I'm still on
prawn cocktail... Fuck it,

07:58.433 --> 08:00.912
I'm going to have to go and get
some prawn cocktail crisps.

08:00.913 --> 08:04.912
Get me a packet.

08:08.433 --> 08:10.752
Tomorrow, we're going to be focusing on

08:10.753 --> 08:12.752
the challenges
that you are going to be facing.

08:12.753 --> 08:14.912
So, dads, this is really
where you come in.

08:14.913 --> 08:17.872
And, mums, you're going to need
as much help as you can get.

08:17.873 --> 08:21.872
Um, so do you want to come
and have a cup of tea?

08:29.953 --> 08:32.232
Yike! Ah...

08:32.232 --> 08:33.991
Cool... What the funk!

08:33.993 --> 08:37.991
Whoa! "Post-op transgender
genitalia" What?! God, man,

08:39.592 --> 08:41.032
I knew summat dodgy was going on

08:41.033 --> 08:42.871
behind that sweet little face of yours.

08:42.873 --> 08:45.032
Not this shit, though, dude.
Not chicks with dicks.

08:45.033 --> 08:46.272
Give it to me.
Eh?

08:46.273 --> 08:47.592
Give it back.
To be honest,

08:47.593 --> 08:49.192
you've gone up in my estimation.

08:49.193 --> 08:51.872
I'm not looking at them to get
turned on.

08:51.873 --> 08:54.672
Shit, what are you going to do?
Are you going to get a dick put on?

08:54.673 --> 08:56.552
Yeah.

08:56.553 --> 08:59.232
That's exactly what I'm doing,
I'm going to get a dick put on.

08:59.233 --> 09:01.672
Se... For serious?

09:01.673 --> 09:04.192
I always wanted a dick so I
thought, "What am I waiting for?

09:04.193 --> 09:05.872
"Let's get a dick."
Fuckin' hell!

09:05.873 --> 09:08.832
Ohh... that's amazing.
So what do they do?

09:08.833 --> 09:12.832
I mean, do you... buy a dick
or does someone donate you one?

09:14.313 --> 09:15.992
You have to order them.

09:15.993 --> 09:19.272
You just tell them what colour you
want, how long you want it

09:19.273 --> 09:23.272
and you go for a couple of fittings
and they just stitch it on.

09:24.873 --> 09:26.952
That's amazing. Isn't it?

09:26.953 --> 09:27.992
Mm.

09:27.993 --> 09:28.952
To be honest, though,

09:28.953 --> 09:31.752
the thought of you with your big
floppy cock has kind of put me off

09:31.753 --> 09:33.112
my prawn cocktail crisps a bit!

09:33.113 --> 09:33.832
I'll have them.

09:33.833 --> 09:37.832
Bastard.

09:42.513 --> 09:43.872
Anyone fancy a drink?

09:43.873 --> 09:46.152
I'm in.

09:46.153 --> 09:48.592
Let's drink to forget,
drown me bloody sorrows.

09:48.593 --> 09:50.712
Just need a shit.
I'll meet you down there.

09:50.713 --> 09:51.912
OK.

09:51.913 --> 09:55.912
Enjoy your shit.

09:58.713 --> 10:00.352
Sorry, are you using that?

10:00.353 --> 10:01.752
I can't handle this.

10:01.753 --> 10:03.872
I can't even go to an antenatal class.

10:03.873 --> 10:05.672
How am I supposed to have a baby?

10:05.673 --> 10:08.392
I thought I could do it, but I can't.

10:08.393 --> 10:11.272
Oh, it's a design fault.

10:11.273 --> 10:13.152
Why don't they give us bigger vaginae?

10:13.153 --> 10:17.152
How are you meant to get something
so big out of something so small?

10:17.673 --> 10:20.032
Apparently, they suck the life out
of your tits,

10:20.033 --> 10:21.752
so, er, you can kiss them goodbye.

10:21.753 --> 10:25.752
I can't do this. I can't do this.
I can't...

10:39.713 --> 10:41.312
What the fuck have you done to me?

10:41.313 --> 10:45.312
I don't know. Um... I don't know.

10:48.313 --> 10:49.604
Wait!

11:09.144 --> 11:11.063
Didn't think you'd come.

11:11.064 --> 11:13.223
Why wouldn't I come?

11:13.224 --> 11:15.423
Oh, what, do you really think
I'm that shallow?

11:15.424 --> 11:19.303
- Well, it must have been weird for you.
- It's no big deal.

11:19.304 --> 11:22.943
All right, OK,
it was a bit weird for both of us.

11:22.944 --> 11:25.263
I just know I don't wanna
stop seeing you.

11:25.264 --> 11:27.463
Look, I'm gonna take care of this, OK?

11:27.464 --> 11:30.703
It's not going to be like this
for ever. I promise.

11:30.704 --> 11:33.663
So, do I get some free drinks, then?

11:33.664 --> 11:37.383
Because if I'm not, what is the
point in going out with a barman?

11:39.824 --> 11:42.423
I'd always thought I'd marry
a girl called Nadine, man.

11:42.424 --> 11:45.463
So, guess what happened to me.

11:45.464 --> 11:46.863
Oh, my God.

11:46.864 --> 11:48.383
I know. It's totally fucked.

11:48.384 --> 11:51.183
I went to the toilet and there was
this girl and she had this power.

11:51.184 --> 11:54.263
Next thing, I'm pregnant, she's not.
Tried to run after her,

11:54.264 --> 11:56.623
couldn't catch her.

11:56.707 --> 11:58.146
It's fucking heavy.

11:58.220 --> 11:59.379
Can I...

11:59.380 --> 12:02.419
All the times I shagged people
and never got pregnant.

12:02.420 --> 12:04.239
I go for a quiet dump
and then this happens.

12:04.313 --> 12:05.433
Well, what are you gonna do?

12:05.434 --> 12:08.872
Gonna find her and I'm gonna
shove this baby right up her arse.

12:09.873 --> 12:11.033
Someone get me a vodka tonic.

12:11.034 --> 12:14.032
Whoa.

12:14.033 --> 12:15.832
You're kidding me.

12:15.833 --> 12:19.832
It... It's such bullshit.

12:19.913 --> 12:21.952
I'll have lemonade.

12:21.953 --> 12:25.952
I'll have a...

12:29.113 --> 12:30.432
Hey, listen.

12:30.433 --> 12:33.752
If you ev...

12:33.753 --> 12:37.272
If you ever need any advice on dicks,

12:37.273 --> 12:41.272
or dick maintenance...
shit, you know where I am.

12:41.433 --> 12:43.792
Great, I will definitely
take you up on that.

12:43.793 --> 12:45.072
Not a problem. For example,

12:45.073 --> 12:47.992
I have a pretty brutal grooming regime.

12:47.993 --> 12:51.912
Moisturise my balls twice a day,
keeps the wrinkles at bay.

12:51.913 --> 12:53.832
- Constant battle, though.
- Wow.

12:53.833 --> 12:55.952
Please, talk to me more
about your balls!

12:55.953 --> 12:59.352
You're being sarcastic, aren't you?

12:59.353 --> 13:01.952
Fuckin'...

13:01.953 --> 13:03.512
I'm pretty... You being sarcastic?

13:03.513 --> 13:06.232
I'm pretty...
pretty sure you're being sarcastic.

13:06.233 --> 13:08.153
What does the sexy barman
think about all this?

13:08.154 --> 13:09.352
About what?

13:09.353 --> 13:12.312
About the old switcheroo.

13:12.313 --> 13:13.872
Fuckin' sex change.

13:13.873 --> 13:17.872
He... He doesn't know.
He doesn't need to know.

13:18.473 --> 13:19.672
What do you mean?

13:19.673 --> 13:22.512
You're just gonna bloody surp...
You're just gonna surprise him?

13:22.513 --> 13:26.152
"Oh, fuckin' happy birthday.
I've got a friggin' cock"?

13:26.153 --> 13:28.392
That is... That's horrible
That's disgraceful.

13:28.393 --> 13:31.272
I've never heard anything like it
in my life. I'm gonna tell him.

13:31.273 --> 13:32.432
Don't you fucking dare!

13:32.433 --> 13:34.072
Quickly tell him. Dude?

13:34.073 --> 13:36.552
- He's got... He's got a fanny.
- What?

13:40.433 --> 13:41.632
He's got a what?

13:41.633 --> 13:43.112
A vagina.

13:43.113 --> 13:44.032
What the fuck!

13:44.033 --> 13:45.152
Someone stole it from him.

13:45.153 --> 13:47.672
They did a swap.

13:47.673 --> 13:50.272
Can't believe it. Alex the barman.
He's got a mangina.

13:50.273 --> 13:53.152
If you tell anyone, I will fuck you
up. Do you understand me?

13:53.153 --> 13:57.152
Yeah. Sorry. Yeah. Understand.

14:02.193 --> 14:04.112
- What was all that about?
- Nothing.

14:04.113 --> 14:08.112
You and Jess.

14:20.353 --> 14:23.072
Quick thing. You know the girl
who was here yesterday...

14:23.073 --> 14:24.352
the young one here on her own?

14:24.466 --> 14:25.185
Tara?

14:25.186 --> 14:26.985
Yeah. I need her address.

14:26.986 --> 14:29.105
Oh, I can't give out personal details.

14:29.106 --> 14:31.625
It's important. I've got
something that belongs to her.

14:31.626 --> 14:35.065
You can give it to me
and I'll make sure she gets it.

14:35.066 --> 14:38.305
Doesn't really work like that. Plus,
I'd like to give it to her myself.

14:38.306 --> 14:42.305
Look, I'm really sorry,
but I can't help you.

14:48.346 --> 14:50.105
Wish she'd tell me
where that girl lives.

14:50.106 --> 14:53.305
Maybe I should lock her
in the boot of a car.

14:53.306 --> 14:54.905
Have you got a car?

14:54.906 --> 14:56.345
Jess has got a car.

14:56.346 --> 14:57.785
A hatchback.

14:57.786 --> 15:00.505
I don't think she'd fit.

15:00.506 --> 15:03.625
Well, what about the laptop?

15:03.626 --> 15:04.945
Yes.

15:04.946 --> 15:08.905
Good - steal the laptop,
find the address, sell it on.

15:08.906 --> 15:12.905
Just need a distraction.

15:15.306 --> 15:19.305
I'll take care of this.

15:28.306 --> 15:30.185
Are you shitting yourself?

15:30.186 --> 15:34.185
Is that the distraction?
Cos I'm not sure that's gonna work.

15:42.186 --> 15:43.025
Oh, my...

15:43.026 --> 15:44.185
That's your power?

15:44.186 --> 15:47.065
You can spill cups of tea?

15:47.066 --> 15:49.625
No, it... It's telekinesis.

15:49.626 --> 15:53.625
It's not exclusive to tea.

16:06.786 --> 16:08.745
Where the fuck did that come from?

16:08.746 --> 16:11.225
What?

16:11.226 --> 16:14.625
Did you... Did you have that before?

16:14.626 --> 16:17.985
Oh, that. No. That's new.

16:17.986 --> 16:20.385
Went to do a shit
and there was this girl in the toilet

16:20.386 --> 16:23.065
and she was really upset
and she transferred her baby into me.

16:27.026 --> 16:29.425
You think this is...

16:29.426 --> 16:32.625
funny?

16:32.626 --> 16:35.905
You see me laughing?

16:35.906 --> 16:39.905
No.

16:41.066 --> 16:44.745
Is this yours?

16:44.746 --> 16:48.745
Did you shoot
your watery little spunk up her?

16:49.706 --> 16:51.625
No.

16:51.626 --> 16:55.625
My watery little spunk
hasn't been anywhere near her.

17:19.146 --> 17:21.145
It's one of these flats up here.

17:21.146 --> 17:23.224
It's going up her arse.

17:23.226 --> 17:27.025
Ha-ha. Hey, I had the most amazing
dream about Nadine last night.

17:27.026 --> 17:29.785
Ow. He just kicked me.

17:29.786 --> 17:30.826
How'd you know it's a him?

17:30.827 --> 17:33.505
I don't know, just feels like a him.

17:33.506 --> 17:35.385
I'll tell you summat else Nadine said.

17:35.386 --> 17:38.705
No of fence, but will you
shut the fuck up about Nadine?

17:38.706 --> 17:40.065
What do you mean?

17:40.066 --> 17:42.185
It's all you've gone on about all day.

17:42.186 --> 17:45.145
Nadine, Nadine, Nadine.

17:45.146 --> 17:46.305
It is fucking boring.

17:46.306 --> 17:48.985
Usually when I meet a girl,
it's... it's all down here.

17:48.986 --> 17:50.505
It's dick-based.

17:50.506 --> 17:53.945
I tried putting on a bit of grot
this morning. A bit of girl-on-girl.

17:53.946 --> 17:56.225
Scissoring, all that,
just clear my mind a bit.

17:56.226 --> 17:57.465
So sweet.

17:57.466 --> 17:59.785
The first time I want to see
a girl for the second time

17:59.786 --> 18:03.785
and I... I don't know
where to find her, do I?

18:04.946 --> 18:06.946
Let's go shove a baby
up a girl's arse, shall we?

18:06.947 --> 18:08.225
Right, for fuck's sake.

18:08.226 --> 18:12.225
Abbey, come on!

18:45.466 --> 18:48.345
What are you doing?

18:48.346 --> 18:51.945
I'm not giving him back.
I'm keeping him. He's mine now.

18:51.946 --> 18:53.825
You can't keep somebody else's baby.

18:53.826 --> 18:56.065
What, you don't think
I can look after it?

18:56.066 --> 18:57.865
No, to be honest with you, not really.

18:57.866 --> 18:59.706
Why would you even want
another woman's baby?

18:59.707 --> 19:03.465
I don't know who I am!

19:08.266 --> 19:11.065
When the storm happened,
I lost my memory.

19:11.066 --> 19:13.145
I forgot everything.

19:13.146 --> 19:15.305
No-one's looking for me.

19:15.306 --> 19:16.345
I've got no-one.

19:16.346 --> 19:17.985
What, are you like an orphan?

19:17.986 --> 19:19.625
No.

19:19.626 --> 19:23.625
Well, I... I don't know.
I don't... I don't think so.

19:26.226 --> 19:30.225
It's the first time I've felt
really part of something.

19:30.426 --> 19:32.825
He needs me.

19:32.826 --> 19:36.105
I can love him and he can love me.

19:36.106 --> 19:38.305
I'm not giving him back.

19:38.306 --> 19:40.145
D'oh...

19:44.066 --> 19:46.665
That's a very beautiful and, er...

19:46.666 --> 19:50.185
a very sad thing you just said there.

19:50.186 --> 19:53.065
Anyway, I'm fuckin' starving
and I'm eating for two,

19:53.066 --> 19:56.265
so I'm gonna go and get a Kit Kat.

20:01.826 --> 20:04.145
Thought I'd take you
somewhere nice for lunch.

20:04.146 --> 20:08.145
Then I thought, "Nah, fuck that.
Petrol station."

20:10.506 --> 20:12.185
You all right?

20:12.186 --> 20:13.345
Look at 'em.

20:13.346 --> 20:15.065
The happy couple.

20:15.066 --> 20:16.385
Just forget about her.

20:16.386 --> 20:18.585
I'm stupid for thinking
I could compete with him.

20:18.586 --> 20:22.585
I mean, look at 'em. Perfect.

20:24.866 --> 20:26.785
Fuck it, right. You...

20:26.786 --> 20:28.426
You, shut up,
you forced this out of me.

20:28.427 --> 20:32.425
He is a man... with a fanny.

20:33.066 --> 20:34.225
Are you happy now?

20:34.226 --> 20:36.865
What, he's got a fanny?
What, he's a woman?

20:36.866 --> 20:38.705
He's got both, like a worm?

20:38.706 --> 20:41.505
Shit, I don't know how it works.
It's storm-related, innit?

20:41.506 --> 20:44.585
All I know is where
once there was a penis,

20:44.586 --> 20:46.385
there is now merely a vagina.

20:46.386 --> 20:48.145
Are you sure about this?

20:48.146 --> 20:52.145
Dude, honestly, Alex,
sexy barman, he's got no dick.

20:55.506 --> 20:58.425
Oh, my God.

20:58.426 --> 21:00.145
This is the greatest day of me life.

21:00.146 --> 21:04.145
I c... I could cry happy tears all
over his little hairy man fanny.

21:04.426 --> 21:07.065
Don't say anything, because
apparently he's quite sensitive

21:07.066 --> 21:09.105
about the whole thing,
you know what I mean?

21:09.106 --> 21:10.545
Oh, he's sensitive, is he?

21:10.546 --> 21:11.785
Oh, dear.

21:11.786 --> 21:14.865
Yeah, well he might be good-looking,
and he might have the girl,

21:14.866 --> 21:17.825
but he hasn't got a penis and,
really, isn't that all that matters?

21:17.826 --> 21:21.305
Well, yeah, there's that and
the love of a good woman, really.

21:21.306 --> 21:25.305
So, he hasn't got a dick and you have,

21:25.546 --> 21:29.545
but Jess would still rather
be with him.

21:31.146 --> 21:32.625
Great.

21:32.626 --> 21:34.625
Thanks for ruining the moment.

21:34.626 --> 21:36.185
Come on, mate.

21:36.186 --> 21:40.185
Eh?

21:45.226 --> 21:48.025
Mate, listen.

21:48.026 --> 21:50.665
I just...

21:50.666 --> 21:54.025
I reckon maybe it's time
you cut your losses now.

21:54.026 --> 21:57.665
You know, the whole Jess thing?

21:57.666 --> 22:01.665
Maybe I should tell her that I'm not
gonna take any more of her shit.

22:03.306 --> 22:05.625
Yeah, you're right.

22:05.626 --> 22:09.625
Of course I'm right.

22:10.666 --> 22:13.745
Oi. Check this out.

22:13.746 --> 22:17.745
Right, now, I'm gonna
give you three guesses.

22:19.106 --> 22:22.065
Who am I?

22:22.066 --> 22:24.265
Ho-way! Y'all right?

22:24.266 --> 22:26.145
Oh, look at the state of that.

22:26.146 --> 22:27.545
I've got a lovely soft fanny.

22:27.546 --> 22:29.425
It's all soft and furry.

22:29.426 --> 22:31.905
Look at me little furry Virginia.

22:31.906 --> 22:34.945
Oh, it's like a little squirrel's
gone in there. Give it a stroke.

22:34.946 --> 22:36.465
I want it to become my friend.

22:36.466 --> 22:38.305
I don't...

22:38.306 --> 22:39.385
Here he is!

22:39.386 --> 22:40.825
Big man. How you doing?

22:40.826 --> 22:44.825
You all ri... Oh.

22:46.266 --> 22:48.265
That was a bit of a clanger, wasn't it?

22:48.266 --> 22:51.465
I can't believe you fucking told them.

22:51.466 --> 22:55.105
Told them what?

22:55.106 --> 22:59.105
Alex!

23:10.186 --> 23:12.425
Ohh. I don't think he noticed.

23:12.426 --> 23:14.145
Think we got away wi' it.

23:14.146 --> 23:15.505
Anyway...

23:17.466 --> 23:19.665
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm s...
I'm s-s-sorry! I'm sorry.

23:19.666 --> 23:21.465
Uh!

23:21.466 --> 23:22.505
Oh!

23:29.986 --> 23:32.145
Oh, this is a definite low point, man.

23:32.146 --> 23:36.145
I can't...

23:59.106 --> 24:01.305
You.

24:01.306 --> 24:02.585
I need your full name.

24:02.586 --> 24:06.585
What for?

24:08.426 --> 24:09.705
You're not on the system.

24:09.706 --> 24:13.705
And if you're not on the system,
then you don't exist.

24:14.466 --> 24:16.065
Fine.

24:16.066 --> 24:17.385
I'm Abbey.

24:17.386 --> 24:18.625
Abbey Smith.

24:18.626 --> 24:21.825
I will not allow

24:21.826 --> 24:25.825
anarchy and chaos
to overtake my community centre.

24:52.386 --> 24:56.145
'Hi, this is Alex.
Please leave a message.'

24:56.146 --> 25:00.145
Oh, all right, I fucked up.
Will you just call me?

25:01.546 --> 25:05.545
Right, I'm coming over.

25:19.026 --> 25:20.425
This better be good.

25:20.426 --> 25:22.665
I know where it is.

25:22.666 --> 25:24.341
I know who's got your cock.

25:28.751 --> 25:30.911
Apparently, she just turned
up one night with a cock.

25:30.956 --> 25:32.315
No surgery, nothing.

25:32.316 --> 25:33.915
What's her name?

25:33.916 --> 25:36.555
She calls herself James.

25:36.556 --> 25:40.555
She hangs around in
the karaoke bar on the estate.

25:44.276 --> 25:46.195
There's half.

25:46.196 --> 25:50.195
You get the rest when I get it back.

25:57.636 --> 26:00.275
What are you doing?

26:00.276 --> 26:03.235
You never said anything
about hurting anyone.

26:03.236 --> 26:07.235
Don't try and stop me.

26:26.556 --> 26:29.635
Probation worker's
looking me up on the system.

26:29.636 --> 26:33.635
But if you lost your memory, how do
you know your name's Abbey Smith?

26:33.716 --> 26:36.435
I don't. I just thought it sounded
all right, so I went with that.

26:36.436 --> 26:37.035
Abbey Smith.

26:37.036 --> 26:38.555
Abbey S... Abbey S... Abbey Smith.

26:38.556 --> 26:41.355
All the names in all the bloody
world. You could have been Jasmine.

26:41.356 --> 26:43.355
G-Geraldine, you could have been.

26:43.356 --> 26:46.155
But, no, here... Here she is.
Abbey S... Smith, as well!

26:46.156 --> 26:50.155
Hi, Rudy.

26:51.196 --> 26:53.995
Oh, my... Oh, my God, it's...

26:53.996 --> 26:57.715
It's you. It's you. What are you...
What are you doing here?

26:57.716 --> 26:59.355
I came to see you.

26:59.356 --> 27:01.235
Fuck off. Seriously? I...

27:01.236 --> 27:02.395
Is that OK?

27:02.396 --> 27:04.595
God. Course it's OK. I...

27:04.596 --> 27:08.035
It's... It is so good to see you.

27:08.036 --> 27:12.035
So, Nadine, I've heard a lot about you.

27:12.876 --> 27:14.875
Aren't you going to introduce us?

27:14.876 --> 27:17.915
Yeah, I'm gonna...

27:17.916 --> 27:21.915
Nadine, that's Finn, that's Abbey.

27:22.156 --> 27:23.435
Fuck off.

27:23.436 --> 27:25.115
Go away.

27:25.116 --> 27:27.395
Go on. Do one.
What are they like?

27:27.396 --> 27:29.955
So, what...
Seriously, have you found me?

27:29.956 --> 27:31.475
You told me where you worked.

27:31.476 --> 27:33.395
Yes, I did tell you where I...

27:33.396 --> 27:35.635
Because it's the community centre,
is where I am.

27:35.636 --> 27:37.515
Fucking caretaker of the community...

27:37.516 --> 27:38.635
Centre of the community.

27:38.636 --> 27:40.795
It's a thankless job, really.
It's pretty...

27:40.796 --> 27:42.275
It's pretty humble.

27:42.276 --> 27:46.275
I think it has its own...
sort of quiet dignity to it, though.

27:47.276 --> 27:48.315
Anyway.

27:48.316 --> 27:49.675
Do you feel OK?

27:49.676 --> 27:52.675
Yeah, I'm all right.

27:52.676 --> 27:55.475
I'm absolutely tiptop.

27:58.876 --> 28:02.875
Just gonna have to excuse me
for just a minute, cos...

28:03.516 --> 28:04.995
Fuck! Uhh!

28:07.876 --> 28:10.035
What are you playing at?
You're messing this up.

28:10.036 --> 28:12.275
What, no, I'm not, dude.
I'm trying... I'm trying.

28:12.276 --> 28:15.275
You're not, you're being weird.
What's all this?

28:15.276 --> 28:17.755
You know, honestly, I like this one.
She's amazing.

28:17.756 --> 28:19.835
Whoa, hey, whoa. What do you mean?
What do you...

28:19.836 --> 28:22.355
What you on about,
you fancy her or summat?

28:22.356 --> 28:24.035
Yeah, think I do, yeah.

28:24.036 --> 28:26.115
Right, well, she's mine, so back off.

28:26.116 --> 28:28.195
You keep your friggin' mitts
off her, pal.

28:28.196 --> 28:30.796
Why don't you get it? This is
the one girl we can both agree on.

28:30.797 --> 28:32.635
We could both be happy here.

28:32.636 --> 28:35.835
This is why you can't afford
to fuck this up.

28:35.836 --> 28:39.675
Shit, man, help me out. I'm getting
all nervous around her and...

28:39.676 --> 28:43.115
Be straight with her, yeah?
And no bullshit.

28:43.116 --> 28:45.355
You know, just for once in your life,

28:45.356 --> 28:49.235
talk to her like she's a human being
instead of a piece of meat.

28:49.236 --> 28:53.155
Come on, I'm gonna be right there.

28:53.156 --> 28:54.995
Let's go. Come on.

28:56.556 --> 28:58.755
Er...

28:58.756 --> 29:02.515
Sorry about that.

29:02.516 --> 29:04.395
Er, so, I was...

29:04.396 --> 29:06.235
I was just wondering...

29:06.236 --> 29:10.035
Are... Are you hungry?

29:10.036 --> 29:13.155
Because, if you want, we could get
something from the vending machine

29:13.156 --> 29:15.995
if you want.

29:19.476 --> 29:23.475
Can you just open the door?

29:24.596 --> 29:28.595
I know you're pissed off with me.

29:35.076 --> 29:36.395
Who are you?

29:36.396 --> 29:37.995
You need to find Alex.

29:37.996 --> 29:39.435
He's crazy.

29:39.436 --> 29:41.675
He'll do anything to get his cock back.

29:41.676 --> 29:45.675
He's got a gun.

29:45.676 --> 29:47.475
So...

29:47.476 --> 29:50.115
what kind of hours do you work?

29:50.116 --> 29:51.755
Well, I'm the senior caretaker,

29:51.756 --> 29:54.395
so technically I'm on call,
like, 24 hours a day.

29:54.396 --> 29:56.195
It's like...

29:56.196 --> 30:00.075
It's very much like
being a doctor in many...

30:00.076 --> 30:02.035
in many respects. Bollocks to it.

30:02.036 --> 30:06.035
Do you know what?
Fuck it. I'm, er...

30:06.556 --> 30:08.275
I'm not the caretaker.

30:08.276 --> 30:10.835
I'm just saying, I'm lying. I...

30:10.836 --> 30:14.435
I just told you that cos I didn't
want you to know the truth, really.

30:14.436 --> 30:18.435
I'm on community service.

30:19.996 --> 30:22.995
It's just that you're so pretty
and... you're clever.

30:22.996 --> 30:24.875
I thought that if you knew the truth,

30:24.876 --> 30:27.875
then you just wouldn't want
to bother even talking to me.

30:27.876 --> 30:30.475
I'm just some...

30:30.476 --> 30:32.715
some fuck-up.

30:32.716 --> 30:35.275
I pick up dog shit with one
of them little grabber things,

30:35.276 --> 30:39.275
you know what I mean?

30:40.476 --> 30:44.475
I'm sorry.

30:45.556 --> 30:49.555
It's not for me to judge you.

31:00.127 --> 31:00.806
I've got to go.

31:00.807 --> 31:02.246
Oh, no, no. Don't.

31:02.247 --> 31:05.566
Please don't go. Don't. Don't.

31:05.567 --> 31:09.566
Nadine. Fucking... Nadine!

31:09.887 --> 31:10.926
How did it go?

31:10.927 --> 31:13.286
It was amazing and then she's...

31:13.287 --> 31:14.806
She ran away - again.

31:14.807 --> 31:17.206
She left her bag.

31:17.207 --> 31:19.806
Shit!

31:19.807 --> 31:21.886
Why does she keep running off, then?

31:21.887 --> 31:24.886
Because she's a girl.
That's what they do.

31:24.887 --> 31:26.926
They string you along
like a little puppy

31:26.927 --> 31:30.606
and then, when you think you've got
a chance, they end up with...

31:30.607 --> 31:33.726
some guy who works in a bar
who doesn't even have a dick.

31:33.727 --> 31:36.846
Maybe she's some sexy psycho werewolf
who doesn't want you finding out.

31:36.847 --> 31:39.686
Well, fuck...
What if it's that? Shit!

31:39.687 --> 31:43.686
Oi! Don't swear in front of the bump!

31:48.887 --> 31:50.846
Come on, we need to follow her.

31:50.847 --> 31:51.886
Yeah?

31:51.887 --> 31:55.886
All right, just...

32:04.047 --> 32:06.966
'I need you to meet me at the
karaoke bar on the estate, er...'

32:06.967 --> 32:09.446
Something's going on with Alex.

32:09.447 --> 32:11.686
'He is gonna try and get his cock back.

32:11.687 --> 32:15.686
'I'm really worried
what he's gonna do.'

32:17.327 --> 32:20.926
To be honest, I really couldn't
give a shit about you and Alex.

32:20.927 --> 32:23.126
'So I'm probably
gonna give it a miss.'

32:23.127 --> 32:24.486
Why are you being such a prick?

32:24.487 --> 32:26.526
Good luck with it, though, yeah?

32:26.527 --> 32:30.526
I hope you're happy together.

32:30.647 --> 32:33.526
Fuck. I've j... I've just hung up
on Jess, that's really rude.

32:33.527 --> 32:37.526
Wait.

32:41.687 --> 32:44.726
Is she shitting in the bushes? Why
would she be shitting in the bushes?

32:44.727 --> 32:46.286
It's the werewolf thing, I told you.

32:46.287 --> 32:50.286
Hey, we need to be getting
to the karaoke bar.

32:50.367 --> 32:54.366
What the f...

32:58.807 --> 33:01.486
Ohh.

33:01.487 --> 33:03.726
Shit, I'm in love with a fucking nun.

33:03.727 --> 33:07.166
Ah. Yep. Looks like it.

33:07.167 --> 33:08.806
I'm just gonna call her back.

33:08.807 --> 33:10.246
What are the fucking chances?

33:10.247 --> 33:12.395
When was the last time
you even saw a nun?

33:48.069 --> 33:49.548
I'm sorry for hanging up on you.

33:49.549 --> 33:51.348
It doesn't matter.
Let's get on with it.

33:51.466 --> 33:53.585
Oh, right, now, listen.

33:53.586 --> 33:56.625
If I go in there,
am I gonna get my penis stolen?

33:56.626 --> 33:58.825
Why would anyone want
to steal your puny cock?

33:58.826 --> 34:01.905
He's got a point, actually. I can't
have anyone stealing my fanny.

34:01.906 --> 34:03.425
I'm gonna be using it very soon.

34:03.426 --> 34:07.425
We just need to find Alex, OK?

34:26.746 --> 34:28.505
What are you doing?

34:28.505 --> 34:31.065
I went to your flat,
I know what's going on.

34:31.065 --> 34:34.405
Dude, I'm sorry about the dick-tuck
thing. It was fucking insensitive.

34:34.437 --> 34:35.716
Where is she?

34:36.717 --> 34:40.235
This is a song very close to my heart.

34:40.237 --> 34:41.716
I hope you'll like it, too.

34:41.717 --> 34:43.436
Is that the probation worker?

probably can't, but I've got to try.

42:25.677 --> 42:29.676
And since he's been gone,
he's all I can think about.

42:31.637 --> 42:35.636

42:37.677 --> 42:41.196

molester or a probation worker,

43:32.997 --> 43:35.476
What happened to the baby?

43:35.477 --> 43:39.476
I gave him back.

43:39.637 --> 43:40.916

43:40.917 --> 43:41.996
Fine.

43:41.997 --> 43:45.996

Mum gets her baby back.

43:53.877 --> 43:54.956

43:54.957 --> 43:57.636

to be on community service.

43:57.637 --> 44:00.316
You're not actually
on community service.

44:00.317 --> 44:04.316
Maybe see you around.

44:05.437 --> 44:09.436
You've been fucking with me!

44:09.717 --> 44:13.716
You don't get to fuck with me!

44:18.397 --> 44:21.556
Do you know what they do...

44:21.557 --> 44:25.556
to people who pretend
to be on community service?

44:43.477 --> 44:46.196
So, this is ironic, innit?

44:46.197 --> 44:48.236
Maybe it's meant to be.

44:48.237 --> 44:51.756
I mean, it's the first steps to
finding out who I actually am.

44:51.757 --> 44:55.756
It's all part of some big cosmic plan.

44:58.837 --> 45:02.836
You just stepped in some dog shit.

45:13.317 --> 45:15.676
There is a young man here to see you.

45:15.677 --> 45:17.677
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- 'Be careful, Nadine.'

45:17.678 --> 45:19.116
Oi! Don't go.

45:19.117 --> 45:22.796

45:22.797 --> 45:24.356

45:24.357 --> 45:25.796

45:25.797 --> 45:28.716
Well, we're just gonna have to put
it down to an act of God, Finley!

45:28.717 --> 45:29.596
So, what's the plan?

45:29.597 --> 45:33.596
Use the special powers you got after
being struck by that freak storm.

45:33.637 --> 45:35.636
Shh! Now, shut up.

45:35.637 --> 45:37.556

45:37.557 --> 45:38.637

45:38.638 --> 45:39.996

45:39.997 --> 45:43.236

bullshit connection thing.

45:43.237 --> 45:44.996
