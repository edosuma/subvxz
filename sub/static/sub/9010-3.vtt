WEBVTT

00:10.083 --> 00:12.042
MAN, I'M GETTING

00:10.083 --> 00:12.042
REALLY GOOD AT THIS!

00:12.083 --> 00:14.459
I SHOULD BE A DEMON HUNTER

00:12.083 --> 00:14.459
IN REAL LIFE.

00:14.500 --> 00:16.876
THAT, OR A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER.

00:16.918 --> 00:19.792
OH, GO WITH THE DEMON HUNTER,

00:16.918 --> 00:19.792
THEY DEAL WITH FEWER DEMONS.

00:22.209 --> 00:24.125
( vibrating )

00:24.167 --> 00:26.876
OH, NO.

00:24.167 --> 00:26.876
IT'S MY DAD.

00:26.918 --> 00:29.042
HE KEEPS ASKING WHERE

00:26.918 --> 00:29.042
I GO AFTER SCHOOL EVERY DAY,

00:29.083 --> 00:30.417
AND I CAN'T TELL HIM

00:29.083 --> 00:30.417
ABOUT OUR JOB.

00:32.959 --> 00:33.584
KAZ!

00:33.626 --> 00:35.042
WHAT?

00:35.083 --> 00:36.918
DO I HAVE SOMETHING

00:35.083 --> 00:36.918
ON MY FACE?

00:36.959 --> 00:38.042
THIS IS SERIOUS.

00:38.083 --> 00:39.584
WHAT AM I GONNA TELL MY DAD?

00:39.626 --> 00:42.042
JUST TELL YOUR DAD

00:39.626 --> 00:42.042
YOU'RE HANGING OUT HERE.

00:42.083 --> 00:43.584
HE DOESN'T WANT ME COMING HERE.

00:43.626 --> 00:46.250
HE THINKS ALL THIS SUPERHERO

00:43.626 --> 00:46.250
STUFF IS A WASTE OF TIME.

00:46.292 --> 00:48.876
OH, AND LIKE WHAT HE DOES

00:46.292 --> 00:48.876
IS SO IMPORTANT.

00:48.918 --> 00:52.167
HE'S A BRAIN TRAUMA RESEARCHER.

00:52.209 --> 00:54.125
JUST TELL YOUR DAD YOU'RE

00:52.209 --> 00:54.125
HANGING OUT AT MY HOUSE.

00:54.167 --> 00:55.375
Oliver: I CAN'T.

00:55.417 --> 00:56.375
HE ALSO DOESN'T WANT ME

00:56.417 --> 00:58.000
HANGING OUT WITH YOU.

00:58.042 --> 00:59.918
HE THINKS YOU'RE RECKLESS,

00:58.042 --> 00:59.918
OUT OF CONTROL,

00:59.959 --> 01:02.542
AND NEVER TAKE RESPONSIBILITY

00:59.959 --> 01:02.542
FOR YOUR OWN ACTIONS.

01:02.584 --> 01:05.959
ONE TIME YOU GO HOME WITH

01:02.584 --> 01:05.959
HALF OF YOUR HEAD SHAVED,

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
AND SUDDENLY I'M RECKLESS?

01:09.042 --> 01:11.375
AND I TAKE RESPONSIBILITY

01:09.042 --> 01:11.375
FOR MY ACTIONS.

01:15.334 --> 01:16.918
WASN'T ME.

HIS HEAD IS ON BACKWARDS.

02:14.083 --> 02:16.375
WELL, THEN HE'S BETTER THAN NEW,

02:16.417 --> 02:18.959
HE NOW HAS THE POWER

02:16.417 --> 02:18.959
TO SEE HIS OWN BUTT.

02:21.209 --> 02:25.209
OLIVER, KAZ, HELP US

02:21.209 --> 02:25.209
SETTLE AN ARGUMENT.

02:25.250 --> 02:28.000
THIS SNAKE LOOKS POISONOUS,

02:25.250 --> 02:28.000
RIGHT?

02:29.751 --> 02:31.250
GUS, THERE'S NOTHING IN THERE.

02:31.292 --> 02:32.375
Gus: UH-OH.

02:32.417 --> 02:34.042
THIS IS TERRIBLE!

02:34.083 --> 02:36.542
NOW WE'LL NEVER BE ABLE

02:34.083 --> 02:36.542
TO SETTLE OUR ARGUMENT.

02:36.584 --> 02:38.500
GUS, WE'RE NOT

02:36.584 --> 02:38.500
HAVING AN ARGUMENT.

02:38.542 --> 02:40.042
YOU'RE TALKING TO YOURSELF,

02:40.083 --> 02:42.000
AND I'M LISTENING

02:40.083 --> 02:42.000
TO A BOOK ON TAPE.

02:45.417 --> 02:46.584
I WONDER WHY THEY STOPPED MAKING

02:46.626 --> 02:48.667
BRAIN MATTER

02:46.626 --> 02:48.667
COMIC BOOKS AND MOVIES.

02:48.709 --> 02:51.042
THERE HASN'T BEEN ONE IN YEARS.

02:51.083 --> 02:53.125
OH, NO.

02:51.083 --> 02:53.125
I KNOW THAT LOOK.

02:53.167 --> 02:54.667
YOU'RE GONNA

02:53.167 --> 02:54.667
SEARCH OBSESSIVELY

02:54.709 --> 02:56.459
FOR THE ANSWER TO A

02:54.709 --> 02:56.459
TOTALLY UNIMPORTANT QUESTION.

02:56.500 --> 02:58.584
YEAH, EVEN IF IT MEANS

02:56.500 --> 02:58.584
ABANDONING YOUR SCHOOL WORK,

02:58.626 --> 03:01.751
YOUR FRIENDS, AND YOUR ALREADY

02:58.626 --> 03:01.751
SHAKY COMMITMENT TO SHOWERING.

03:03.083 --> 03:04.834
OKAY, "A,"

03:04.876 --> 03:06.334
EVERYBODY'S ALREADY

03:04.876 --> 03:06.334
TRYING TO ANSWER

03:06.375 --> 03:07.500
THE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS

03:07.542 --> 03:10.042
AND "B,"

03:07.542 --> 03:10.042
I SHOWERED ON TUESDAY.

03:10.083 --> 03:12.542
A WEEK AGO TUESDAY.

03:13.751 --> 03:14.751
I REMEMBER.

03:14.792 --> 03:18.042
YOU SMELLED GREAT THAT DAY.

03:18.083 --> 03:20.209
( vibrating )

03:21.792 --> 03:23.542
EXCUSE US FOR A MOMENT.

03:23.584 --> 03:25.792
MY DAD JUST TEXTED ME

03:23.584 --> 03:25.792
"WHERE ARE YOU?"

03:25.834 --> 03:27.209
( sighs )

03:27.250 --> 03:28.334
MAYBE I SHOULD

03:27.250 --> 03:28.334
JUST COME CLEAN

03:28.375 --> 03:30.584
AND TELL HIM ABOUT...

03:30.626 --> 03:32.667
( whispers )

03:30.626 --> 03:32.667
the thing.

03:32.709 --> 03:34.626
ALL RIGHT.

03:32.709 --> 03:34.626
HERE'S WHAT YOU DO.

03:34.667 --> 03:36.542
YOU MAKE UP AN

03:34.667 --> 03:36.542
AFTER-SCHOOL ACTIVITY.

03:36.584 --> 03:39.125
SOMETHING THAT SOUNDS PRODUCTIVE

03:36.584 --> 03:39.125
SO HE'LL GET OFF YOUR CASE,

03:39.167 --> 03:41.667
BUT SO BORING HE WON'T

03:39.167 --> 03:41.667
ASK FOR DETAILS.

03:41.709 --> 03:43.542
THAT'S ACTUALLY

03:41.709 --> 03:43.542
A GOOD IDEA, KAZ.

03:43.584 --> 03:44.667
HMM.

03:44.709 --> 03:46.042
WHERE'D YOU

03:44.709 --> 03:46.042
COME UP WITH THAT?

03:46.083 --> 03:47.751
OH, IN ALIBI CLUB.

03:47.792 --> 03:50.500
YEAH, AND IF ANYBODY ASKS...

03:50.542 --> 03:52.125
THAT'S WHERE I AM RIGHT NOW.

03:56.209 --> 03:58.292
HELP SETTLE ANOTHER ARGUMENT.

03:58.334 --> 04:00.042
HOW MANY TIMES A YEAR

04:00.083 --> 04:02.417
DOES THE AVERAGE PERSON

04:00.083 --> 04:02.417
GO TO THE BATHROOM?

04:02.459 --> 04:03.751
I SAY SIX.

04:11.584 --> 04:13.042
UGH.

04:13.083 --> 04:15.209
OLIVER, YOUR BACKPACK STINKS.

04:15.250 --> 04:16.416
I KNOW.

04:16.459 --> 04:18.416
STOP PUTTING YOUR

04:16.459 --> 04:18.416
GYM SHOES IN HERE.

04:18.459 --> 04:20.375
WHERE ELSE AM I

04:18.459 --> 04:20.375
GONNA PUT THEM,

04:20.416 --> 04:22.375
IN MY BACKPACK?

04:20.416 --> 04:22.375
THEY STINK.

04:23.834 --> 04:25.792
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE STINKS,

04:23.834 --> 04:25.792
BY THE WAY?

04:25.834 --> 04:27.834
THE ADVICE YOU

04:25.834 --> 04:27.834
GAVE ME ABOUT MY DAD.

04:27.876 --> 04:29.626
OH, WHY? WHAT HAPPENED?

04:29.667 --> 04:31.042
WELL, I KNOW HE DOESN'T

04:29.667 --> 04:31.042
LIKE THE THEATER,

04:31.083 --> 04:32.209
SO I TOLD HIM

04:31.083 --> 04:32.209
I WAS IN A PLAY.

04:32.250 --> 04:33.584
AH, WHAT PLAY?

04:33.626 --> 04:35.167
THAT'S WHAT  HE </font> <font face="monospaceSansSerif"> SAID.</font>

04:35.209 --> 04:37.542
AND SINCE I WASN'T

04:35.209 --> 04:37.542
PREPARED FOR HIM TO ASK,

04:37.584 --> 04:40.417
I WAS LIKE,

04:37.584 --> 04:40.417
"UM... UM... UM..."

04:40.459 --> 04:43.417
SO NOW HE THINKS THAT'S

04:40.459 --> 04:43.417
THE TITLE OF THE PLAY.

04:43.459 --> 04:45.209
WHAT WOULD A PLAY CALLED

04:43.459 --> 04:45.209
"UM, UM, UM"

04:45.250 --> 04:46.542
POSSIBLY BE ABOUT?

04:46.584 --> 04:48.709
THAT'S </font> <font face="monospaceSansSerif"> WHAT HE SAID.</font>

04:48.751 --> 04:51.417
AND SINCE WE'RE READING

04:48.751 --> 04:51.417
FRANKENSTEIN </font> <font face="monospaceSansSerif"> IN ENGLISH CLASS,</font>

04:51.459 --> 04:53.209
I TOLD HIM IT WAS

04:51.459 --> 04:53.209
ABOUT FRANKENSTEIN,

04:53.250 --> 04:55.042
BUT THE MONSTER

04:53.250 --> 04:55.042
SAYS HE NAME LIKE,

04:55.083 --> 04:58.250
( Frankenstein voice )

04:55.083 --> 04:58.250
"UM...UM...UMMM"

04:59.667 --> 05:01.667
FRANKENSTEIN?

04:59.667 --> 05:01.667
THAT'S SO PLAYED OUT.

05:01.709 --> 05:03.792
WHY WOULD A BUNCH

05:01.709 --> 05:03.792
OF HIGH SCHOOL KIDS

05:01.709 --> 05:03.792
WANNA GO SEE THAT?

05:03.834 --> 05:06.667
THAT'S </font> <font face="monospaceSansSerif"> WHAT </font> HE </font> <font face="monospaceSansSerif"> SAID.</font>

05:06.709 --> 05:08.626
SO, I TOLD HIM IT WAS

05:06.709 --> 05:08.626
AN UPDATED VERSION

05:08.667 --> 05:09.792
SET IN THE WHITE HOUSE.

05:09.834 --> 05:10.792
OH, WELL, THAT

05:09.834 --> 05:10.792
ACTUALLY SOUNDS GOOD.

05:10.834 --> 05:11.918
I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT.

05:11.959 --> 05:14.125
THAT'S WHAT HE SAID!

05:14.167 --> 05:17.792
SO ON FRIDAY, HE WANTS TO GO

05:14.167 --> 05:17.792
TO A PLAY THAT DOES NOT EXIST!

05:19.083 --> 05:20.417
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

05:20.459 --> 05:21.876
HE'S GONNA KNOW I'M LYING.

05:21.918 --> 05:24.042
WELL, OLIVER, WHEN

05:21.918 --> 05:24.042
YOU'RE CAUGHT IN A LIE

05:24.083 --> 05:25.667
THERE'S REALLY ONLY

05:24.083 --> 05:25.667
ONE THING TO DO.

05:25.709 --> 05:26.792
TELL THE TRUTH.

05:26.834 --> 05:28.709
NO!

05:28.751 --> 05:31.584
PILE AN EVEN BIGGER LIE

05:28.751 --> 05:31.584
ON TOP OF THE FIRST LIE.

05:31.626 --> 05:33.667
MY BROTHER TAUGHT ME THAT.

05:33.709 --> 05:35.834
THE BROTHER WHO'S IN JAIL?

05:35.876 --> 05:39.250
YOU'LL HAVE TO BE

05:35.876 --> 05:39.250
MORE SPECIFIC.

05:39.292 --> 05:40.834
WELL, I REALLY HATE LYING,

05:40.876 --> 05:42.876
BUT I CAN'T TELL MY DAD

05:40.876 --> 05:42.876
ABOUT MIGHTY MED.

05:42.918 --> 05:44.626
SO, I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO

05:42.918 --> 05:44.626
WRITE AND PRODUCE

05:44.667 --> 05:46.292
AN ENTIRE SCHOOL PLAY BY FRIDAY,

05:46.334 --> 05:48.042
WHICH MEANS I CAN'T

05:46.334 --> 05:48.042
WORK AT MIGHT MED

05:48.083 --> 05:50.500
SO MY DAD DOESN'T FIND OUT

05:48.083 --> 05:50.500
I WORK AT MIGHTY MED.

05:50.542 --> 05:52.667
IT'S PRETTY FUNNY

05:50.542 --> 05:52.667
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

05:52.709 --> 05:54.626
NO, IT'S NOT.

05:52.709 --> 05:54.626
WELL...

05:54.667 --> 05:56.667
IT'S PRETTY FUNNY

05:54.667 --> 05:56.667
WHEN  I </font> <font face="monospaceSansSerif"> THINK ABOUT IT.</font>

06:02.375 --> 06:05.751
( grunting )

06:05.792 --> 06:07.167
AAH!

06:07.209 --> 06:08.918
( beeping )

06:08.959 --> 06:11.209
WHY AM EVEN BOTHERING

06:08.959 --> 06:11.209
AT PHYSICAL THERAPY?

06:11.250 --> 06:13.125
MY POWERS ARE NEVER COMING BACK.

06:13.167 --> 06:14.751
BUT YOU'RE MAKING

06:13.167 --> 06:14.751
TREMENDOUS PROGRESS.

06:14.792 --> 06:16.000
AT WHAT?

06:16.042 --> 06:18.751
ACCEPTING CRUSHING

06:16.042 --> 06:18.751
DISAPPOINTMENT.

06:18.792 --> 06:21.709
HEY, HORACE.

06:18.792 --> 06:21.709
I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU.

06:21.751 --> 06:23.334
IS IT IMPORTANT?

06:23.375 --> 06:24.626
PROBABLY NOT.

06:24.667 --> 06:25.876
THEN YOU HAVE

06:24.667 --> 06:25.876
MY FULL ATTENTION.

06:25.918 --> 06:27.500
HARDLY ANYONE IS ASKING

06:27.542 --> 06:30.292
THE REALLY UNIMPORTANT

06:27.542 --> 06:30.292
QUESTIONS THESE DAYS.

06:30.334 --> 06:33.250
I KNOW!

06:33.292 --> 06:34.667
HEY, ANYWAY, SINCE

06:33.292 --> 06:34.667
COMIC BOOKS ARE BASED OFF

06:34.709 --> 06:37.250
OF REAL SUPER HEROES,

06:34.709 --> 06:37.250
I WAS WONDERING

06:37.292 --> 06:39.334
WHY THERE AREN'T

06:37.292 --> 06:39.334
ANY MORE STORIES

06:37.292 --> 06:39.334
ABOUT BRAIN MATTER.

06:39.375 --> 06:41.584
( horror movie music plays,

06:39.375 --> 06:41.584
woman screams )

06:41.626 --> 06:43.375
SORRY, THAT WAS MY PHONE.

06:43.417 --> 06:45.792
I WAS JUST CHANGING

06:43.417 --> 06:45.792
THE RING TONE.

06:45.834 --> 06:47.417
WHY DO YOU HAVE A PHONE?

06:47.459 --> 06:48.584
YOU'VE BEEN ON THIS PLANET

06:47.459 --> 06:48.584
FOR, LIKE, A WEEK.

06:48.626 --> 06:49.709
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYBODY.

06:49.751 --> 06:50.792
THAT'S WHY I GOT THE NO FRIENDS

06:50.834 --> 06:53.334
AND NO FAMILY PLAN.

06:54.751 --> 06:57.500
SO... WHAT HAPPENED

06:54.751 --> 06:57.500
TO BRAIN MATTER?

06:57.542 --> 06:59.125
( horror movie music plays,

06:57.542 --> 06:59.125
Horace gasps )

06:59.167 --> 07:01.250
WHY DO YOU KEEP DOING THAT

06:59.167 --> 07:01.250
EVERY TIME I SAY "BRAIN MATTER"?

07:01.292 --> 07:03.459
( horror movie music,

07:01.292 --> 07:03.459
Horace gasps )

07:03.500 --> 07:05.918
OH, YOU'RE HIDING SOMETHING.

07:05.959 --> 07:07.667
AND NOT VERY WELL.

07:07.709 --> 07:08.918
STOP MEDDLING.

07:08.959 --> 07:11.083
I HAVE SOME IMPORTANT WORK

07:08.959 --> 07:11.083
FOR YOU TO DO.

07:12.375 --> 07:15.209
"CHANGE LIGHT BULBS,

07:12.375 --> 07:15.209
CLEAR AWAY COBWEBS."

07:15.250 --> 07:16.709
THIS IS JUST BUSY WORK.

07:16.751 --> 07:18.500
NO, IT ISN'T.

07:18.542 --> 07:21.292
THE TITLE OF THE LIST IS

07:18.542 --> 07:21.292
"BUSY WORK FOR KAZ."

07:24.292 --> 07:26.209
Kaz:

07:24.292 --> 07:26.209
SOMETHING WEIRD'S GOING ON HERE.

07:26.250 --> 07:27.792
SOMETHING SCARY AND WEIRD

07:27.834 --> 07:29.584
AND I'M GONNA FIND OUT

07:27.834 --> 07:29.584
WHAT THAT BIG SECRET IS.

07:29.626 --> 07:32.876
CAN I HELP?

07:29.626 --> 07:32.876
I'M GOING NUTS

07:29.626 --> 07:32.876
SITTING AROUND HERE

07:32.918 --> 07:34.042
WAITING FOR MY POWERS

07:32.918 --> 07:34.042
TO RETURN.

07:34.083 --> 07:36.167
I'M SO DESPERATE,

07:36.209 --> 07:39.042
I'M WILLING TO VOLUNTARILY

07:36.209 --> 07:39.042
SPEND TIME WITH YOU.

07:39.083 --> 07:42.334
YOU KNOW, THAT'S NOT THE

07:39.083 --> 07:42.334
FIRST TIME I'VE HEARD THAT.

07:42.375 --> 07:43.876
AND I'M NOT INSULTED.

07:44.834 --> 07:47.250
SURE. YOU CAN HELP,

07:44.834 --> 07:47.250
BUT BE CAREFUL

07:47.292 --> 07:49.417
IT COULD BE DANGEROUS.

07:49.459 --> 07:50.584
AAH!

07:51.584 --> 07:53.751
HELLO?

07:53.792 --> 07:56.417
UH, NO ONE THERE.

07:56.459 --> 07:58.250
YOU'RE RIGHT.

07:56.459 --> 07:58.250
THERE IS A SECRET.

07:58.292 --> 08:01.292
AND IT'S THE MOST

07:58.292 --> 08:01.292
AMAZING </font> <font face="monospaceSansSerif"> SECRET EVER.</font>

08:01.334 --> 08:03.417
AND I COULD TELL

08:01.334 --> 08:03.417
YOU WHAT IT IS,

08:03.459 --> 08:05.042
BUT I NEVER WILL!

08:05.083 --> 08:07.709
IS IT THAT NOBODY LIKES YOU?

08:07.751 --> 08:10.542
HA! THAT'S NOT SECRET.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.667
SO JORDAN, WANNA

08:15.000 --> 08:17.667
SEE MY UMBILICAL CORD?

08:17.709 --> 08:19.709
I KEEP IT IN MY WALLET.

08:22.334 --> 08:24.042
JORDON, GUS,

08:22.334 --> 08:24.042
I NEED A FAVOR.

08:24.083 --> 08:25.918
YOU HAVE TO HELP ME PUT ON

08:24.083 --> 08:25.918
A PLAY BY TOMORROW.

08:25.959 --> 08:27.834
WHY?

08:25.959 --> 08:27.834
SO MY DAD DOESN'T

08:27.876 --> 08:29.375
KEEP ASKING ME

08:27.876 --> 08:29.375
WHERE I GO AFTER

08:27.876 --> 08:29.375
SCHOOL EVERY DAY.

08:29.417 --> 08:30.918
WHERE DO YOU GO AFTER

08:29.417 --> 08:30.918
SCHOOL EVERY DAY?

08:30.959 --> 08:35.708
I HAVE GOT TO START PREPARING

08:30.959 --> 08:35.708
FOR FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS.

08:35.751 --> 08:37.500
UH, I-I HAVE JOB.

08:37.542 --> 08:39.583
I-I WORK, UM...

08:39.626 --> 08:41.626
MAKING SANDWICHES.

08:41.667 --> 08:43.833
AT A SANDWICH SHOP.

08:43.876 --> 08:46.042
BUT I HAVE TO KEEP IT

08:43.876 --> 08:46.042
A SECRET FROM MY FATHER.

08:46.083 --> 08:47.834
WHY WOULDN'T YOU WANT

08:46.083 --> 08:47.834
YOUR FATHER TO KNOW

08:47.876 --> 08:49.417
YOU MAKE SANDWICHES?

08:49.459 --> 08:51.959
HE HATES SANDWICHES, OKAY?

08:53.083 --> 08:56.500
HE HATES SANDWICHES

08:53.083 --> 08:56.500
AND I LOVE THEM,

08:56.542 --> 09:00.042
( choked up )

08:56.542 --> 09:00.042
AND IT'S TEARING

08:56.542 --> 09:00.042
OUR FAMILY APART.

09:00.083 --> 09:02.667
( normal voice )

09:00.083 --> 09:02.667
NOW, WILL YOU HELP ME

09:00.083 --> 09:02.667
PUT ON THIS PLAY OR NOT?

09:02.709 --> 09:04.042
ABSOLUTELY,

09:04.083 --> 09:06.834
BUT ONLY BECAUSE

09:04.083 --> 09:06.834
I'M SURE IT'LL BE TERRIBLE.

09:06.876 --> 09:08.292
AND THERE'S

09:06.876 --> 09:08.292
NOTHING MORE DELIGHTFUL

09:08.334 --> 09:10.667
THAN WATCHING A FRIEND FAIL.

09:11.876 --> 09:13.667
THEN WHY DON'T YOU

09:11.876 --> 09:13.667
LIKE ME MORE?

09:13.709 --> 09:16.792
I SAID WATCHING A  FRIEND </font> <font face="monospaceSansSerif"> FAIL,</font>

09:16.834 --> 09:18.292
FAIR ENOUGH.

09:18.334 --> 09:20.042
WELL, I'LL DO IT TOO.

09:20.083 --> 09:22.042
BUT ONLY IF YOU

09:20.083 --> 09:22.042
BRING FREE SANDWICHES.

09:22.083 --> 09:23.667
AND HOLD THE MAYO.

09:23.709 --> 09:24.834
FINE.

09:24.876 --> 09:26.000
NO, SERIOUSLY.

09:26.042 --> 09:27.709
HOLD </font> <font face="monospaceSansSerif"> THE MAYO.</font>

09:30.709 --> 09:31.834

HIS BACKPACK'S  SO </font> <font face="monospaceSansSerif"> MUCH LIGHTER</font>

09:33.751 --> 09:36.000
WITH ONLY ONE JAR OF MAYO IN IT.

09:39.083 --> 09:40.292
NOW, OPEN UP AND SAY "AH."

09:43.542 --> 09:45.000
OKAY. YOU'RE PERFECTLY HEALTHY.

09:48.459 --> 09:50.959
HEY, SKYLAR AND I HAVE

09:48.459 --> 09:50.959
LOOKED THROUGH FILES

09:51.000 --> 09:53.042
FOR INFORMATION ABOUT

09:51.000 --> 09:53.042
BRAIN MATTER AND WE FOUND THIS.

09:53.083 --> 09:54.876
BRAIN MATTER CHECKED

09:53.083 --> 09:54.876
INTO THE HOSPITAL YEARS AGO

09:54.918 --> 09:56.626
BUT NEVER CHECKED OUT.

09:56.667 --> 09:58.626
I DON'T KNOW WHAT

09:56.667 --> 09:58.626
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

09:58.667 --> 10:01.542
IF YOU DON'T TELL ME WHAT IT IS,

09:58.667 --> 10:01.542
I WILL...

10:02.542 --> 10:03.876
START BEATBOXING RIGHT NOW.

10:03.918 --> 10:06.000
HE'S JUST CRAZY

10:03.918 --> 10:06.000
ENOUGH TO DO IT.

10:07.083 --> 10:09.876
( beatboxing )

10:09.918 --> 10:12.876
OKAY! OKAY, STOP!

10:09.918 --> 10:12.876
I'LL TELL YOU.

10:12.918 --> 10:18.751
THE TELL OF BRAIN MATTER

10:12.918 --> 10:18.751
IS DARK AND MACAB...RE.

10:18.792 --> 10:21.042
BECAUSE OF HIM,

10:18.792 --> 10:21.042
SOMETHING MONSTROUS

10:21.083 --> 10:23.626
IS HIDDEN BEHIND SOME DOOR

10:21.083 --> 10:23.626
IN MIGHTY MED.

10:23.667 --> 10:26.042
WHATEVER YOU DO,

10:23.667 --> 10:26.042
DO NOT OPEN THAT DOOR.

10:26.083 --> 10:28.667
IT IS THE DOOR OF DOOM!

10:28.709 --> 10:30.459
NOW, WE'RE HAVING PROBLEMS

10:28.709 --> 10:30.459
WITH THE LOCKS,

10:30.500 --> 10:31.751
SO I NEED YOU TO OPEN

10:30.500 --> 10:31.751
EVERY DOOR IN MIGHTY MED.

10:33.709 --> 10:35.083
BUT WHAT ABOUT

10:33.709 --> 10:35.083
THE DOOR OF DOOM?

10:35.125 --> 10:38.626
DO NOT OPEN THE DOOR OF DOOM!

10:38.667 --> 10:40.042
BUT HOW WILL WE KNOW

10:38.667 --> 10:40.042
WHICH DOOR IT IS?

10:40.083 --> 10:42.709
I'VE SAID TOO MUCH.

10:42.751 --> 10:44.709
ACTUALLY, YOU HAVEN'T!

10:50.876 --> 10:53.042
I APPRECIATE YOU GUYS

YOU ASKED FOR,

10:54.709 --> 10:57.667
WHICH WERE FREE

10:54.709 --> 10:57.667
AND NOT 5 .99 EACH

10:57.709 --> 10:59.751
BECAUSE I WORK

10:57.709 --> 10:59.751
AT A SANDWICH SHOP.

11:01.792 --> 11:03.834
GROSS. I DON'T WANT THESE.

11:03.876 --> 11:05.042
THERE'S MAYO ON THEM.

11:05.083 --> 11:08.751
WHAT? YOU CARRY

11:05.083 --> 11:08.751
AROUND GALLONS OF MAYO.

11:08.792 --> 11:11.042

I HAVE A COMMENT

11:11.083 --> 11:13.584

WATCHING YOUR FRIENDS FAIL

IS NO LONGER DELIGHTFUL,

11:17.626 --> 11:19.542
AND INSTEAD BECOMES JUST...

11:19.584 --> 11:21.042

11:40.834 --> 11:45.709
NOW, I WANT THE ATMOSPHERE

11:40.834 --> 11:45.709
TO BE SCARY.

11:45.751 --> 11:47.584
YOU WANT SCARY?

11:47.626 --> 11:48.918
TWO WORDS,

11:48.959 --> 11:51.792
USE DRY ICE TO MAKE FOG.

11:54.083 --> 11:56.834
IT IS SCARY THAT YOU

11:54.083 --> 11:56.834
THINK THAT WAS TWO WORDS.

11:58.083 --> 12:00.626
BUT I WOULD LOVE FOG

11:58.083 --> 12:00.626
ALL OVER THE STAGE.

12:00.667 --> 12:02.042

12:02.083 --> 12:05.042
LET'S CALL HIM "LOUIE,

12:02.083 --> 12:05.042
WHO CAN GET DRY ICE."

12:05.083 --> 12:07.918
EVERYBODY KNOWS A GUY

12:05.083 --> 12:07.918
WHO CAN GET DRY ICE.

12:07.959 --> 12:08.918
ANYONE CAN GET IT.

12:08.959 --> 12:10.834

FINDING OUT WHAT HAPPENED

12:31.083 --> 12:33.167

12:34.709 --> 12:36.042
WHAT IF WE OPEN

12:34.709 --> 12:36.042
THE DOOR OF DOOM?

12:36.083 --> 12:39.042
( clattering )

12:39.083 --> 12:41.042
( sighs )

12:41.083 --> 12:43.709
I WISH I WOULD HAVE DONE

12:41.083 --> 12:43.709
ITEM ONE ON HORACE'S LIST,

12:43.751 --> 12:45.000

12:58.083 --> 12:59.792
AAH!

13:01.083 --> 13:02.959
OH, RELAX.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.667

13:03.000 --> 13:04.667
SUPER SCOUT COOKIES.

13:04.709 --> 13:06.918
I'LL TAKE TWO BOXES

13:04.709 --> 13:06.918

13:10.000 --> 13:11.083
COCONUT, RIGHT?

13:11.125 --> 13:12.167
'CAUSE I HATE COCONUT.

13:12.209 --> 13:13.959
( girls hissing, Kaz screams )

13:19.083 --> 13:22.042

13:22.083 --> 13:25.000
( both screaming )

13:27.959 --> 13:28.751
( Skylar sighs )

13:30.626 --> 13:32.167
IT'S THE DOOR

13:30.626 --> 13:32.167
WE HAVEN'T OPENED.

13:32.209 --> 13:34.250
IT'S GOTTA BE

13:32.209 --> 13:34.250
THE DOOR OF DOOM.

13:34.292 --> 13:35.876
STOP BEING SUCH A BABY.

13:36.751 --> 13:38.667
AAH!

13:40.792 --> 13:41.792
MY EYES!

13:41.834 --> 13:45.000
HEY! A LITTLE PRIVACY PLEASE?

13:48.083 --> 13:51.083
( organ music plays, applause )

13:56.375 --> 13:59.167
THEY CALLED ME "MAD"

13:56.375 --> 13:59.167
WHEN I CREATED A MONSTER

13:59.209 --> 14:02.417
WHO WOULD HAVE TIE-BREAKING VOTE

13:59.209 --> 14:02.417
IN THE SENATE.

14:02.459 --> 14:06.667
NOW, BEFORE BEING ONE HEART BEAT

14:02.459 --> 14:06.667
AWAY FROM THE PRESIDENCY,

14:06.709 --> 14:09.042
I MUST GIVE IT...

14:09.083 --> 14:10.667
A HEART BEAT!

14:10.709 --> 14:12.876
( phone ringing )

14:12.918 --> 14:14.792
I'VE GOTTA GO.

14:12.918 --> 14:14.792
MY DAD HAS A MEETING

14:14.834 --> 14:16.626
AND HE NEEDS HIS SUIT BACK.

14:16.667 --> 14:18.209
UM, I CAN'T DO

14:16.667 --> 14:18.209
THE PLAY WITHOUT YOU.

14:18.250 --> 14:20.292
THE MONSTER'S IN EVERY SCENE.

14:20.334 --> 14:22.751
TRY IMPROV, PEOPLE LOVE IMPROV.

14:22.792 --> 14:23.918
PEOPLE HATE IMPROV.

14:23.959 --> 14:25.876
I KNOW. IT'S THE WORST!

14:25.918 --> 14:28.334
UM... MY MONSTER.

14:28.375 --> 14:31.876
I-IT'S ALIVE!

14:31.918 --> 14:34.292
AND HAS TO RUN SOME ERRANDS!

14:39.250 --> 14:41.876
WELL, WE OPENED EVERY DOOR

14:39.250 --> 14:41.876
IN THE HOSPITAL.

14:41.918 --> 14:44.042
NO DOOR OF DOOM

14:41.918 --> 14:44.042
AND NO BRAIN MATTER.

14:44.083 --> 14:46.042
MAYBE HORACE WAS

14:44.083 --> 14:46.042
JUST TESTING US.

14:46.083 --> 14:48.125
MAYBE THERE IS

14:46.083 --> 14:48.125
NO DOOR OF DOOM.

14:48.167 --> 14:50.042
AAH!

14:50.083 --> 14:52.083
WHAT'S WRONG?

14:52.125 --> 14:55.042
WE'RE OUT OF TOFU-POPS.

14:55.083 --> 14:57.375
( groans )

14:55.083 --> 14:57.375
THAT'S WEIRD.

14:57.417 --> 14:59.918
WHO PUT A BRAIN MATTER

14:57.417 --> 14:59.918
FIGURINE IN THE FREEZER?

15:01.083 --> 15:02.125
OH, WOW.

15:02.167 --> 15:03.834
THIS THING'S REALLY HEAVY.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.042
( buzzing )

15:07.083 --> 15:09.125
IT'S GLOWING!

15:07.083 --> 15:09.125
WHAT'S GOING ON?

15:13.876 --> 15:16.042
IT'S THE REAL BRAIN MATTER.

15:16.083 --> 15:17.250
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

15:17.292 --> 15:19.834
THE LAST THING I REMEMBER

15:19.876 --> 15:21.918
I WAS CONDUCTING

15:19.876 --> 15:21.918
AN EXPERIMENT ON MYSELF.

15:21.959 --> 15:23.751
SOMETHING WENT TERRIBLY WRONG,

15:23.792 --> 15:25.042
BUT I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT.

15:25.083 --> 15:26.042
( gasping )

15:26.083 --> 15:28.000
( moaning )

15:36.834 --> 15:39.083
( groaning )

15:39.125 --> 15:41.083
( deep voice )

15:39.125 --> 15:41.083
NOW I REMEMBER.

15:41.125 --> 15:43.042
( growling )

15:43.083 --> 15:44.876
WHAT DID YOU DO?

15:44.918 --> 15:46.876
I TOLD YOU NOT TO

15:44.918 --> 15:46.876
OPEN THE DOOR OF DOOM

15:46.918 --> 15:48.751
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST TELL ME

15:46.918 --> 15:48.751
NOT TO OPEN THE FREEZER?

15:48.792 --> 15:50.959
BECAUSE I KNOW YOU. IF I SAID,

15:48.792 --> 15:50.959
"KAZ, DON'T OPEN THE FREEZER"

15:51.000 --> 15:52.250
THE FRIST THING YOU'D

15:51.000 --> 15:52.250
DO IS OPEN THE FREEZER.

15:52.292 --> 15:54.209
I OPENED IT ANYWAY!

15:54.250 --> 15:56.334
( Brain Matter screaming )

15:58.000 --> 15:59.083
Skylar: UM, GUYS...

15:59.125 --> 16:01.417
HE CAN PULVERIZE THINGS.

16:01.459 --> 16:03.042
EVERYONE, UP HERE!

16:05.959 --> 16:07.876
HUDDLE TOGETHER!

16:05.959 --> 16:07.876
FORCE FIELD ACTIVATE.

16:10.083 --> 16:11.792
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

16:10.083 --> 16:11.792
BRAIN MATTER WAS A HERO.

16:11.834 --> 16:13.042
HOW'D HE BECOME THIS MONSTER?

16:13.083 --> 16:15.375
YOU'RE LIKE A DOG WITH A BONE.

16:13.083 --> 16:15.375
JUST LET IT GO.

16:15.417 --> 16:17.042
ALL RIGHT, IF THAT'S

16:15.417 --> 16:17.042
THE WAY YOU WANT IT.

16:17.083 --> 16:19.042
( beatboxing )

16:19.083 --> 16:21.083
OKAY! OKAY, FINE. FINE.

16:19.083 --> 16:21.083
I'LL TELL YOU.

16:21.125 --> 16:24.959
BRAIN MATTER WAS A BRILLIANT

16:21.125 --> 16:24.959
SCIENTIST AND CRIME FIGHTER

16:25.000 --> 16:28.042
WHO INVENTED HIS OWN WEAPONS.</font>

16:25.000 --> 16:28.042
MIRACLES OF TECHNOLOGY</font>

16:28.083 --> 16:29.918
THAT MADE HIM A HERO</font>

16:28.083 --> 16:29.918
TO BE RECKONED WITH.</font>

16:29.959 --> 16:32.167
BUT BRAIN MATTER GREW ENVIOUS</font>

16:32.209 --> 16:33.876
OF SUPERHEROES WHO DIDN'T</font>

16:32.209 --> 16:33.876
HAVE RELY ON WEAPONS.</font>

16:33.918 --> 16:35.375
SO, HE DEVELOPED A SERUM</font>

16:35.417 --> 16:36.959
THAT WOULD GIVE HIM</font>

16:35.417 --> 16:36.959
HIS OWN SUPERPOWERS.</font>

16:37.000 --> 16:38.042
I HAD HEARD THE RUMORS,</font>

16:38.083 --> 16:39.500
SO I WENT TO INVESTIGATE.</font>

16:39.542 --> 16:40.876
BUT I WAS TOO LATE.</font>

16:40.918 --> 16:42.042
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

16:42.083 --> 16:44.375
THIS HAPPENED IN THE 1970s?

16:44.417 --> 16:45.876
NO, THIS WAS FIVE YEARS AGO.

16:45.918 --> 16:47.876
I JUST HAD A VERY OUTDATED

16:45.918 --> 16:47.876
SENSE OF STYLE.

16:47.918 --> 16:49.542
ANYWAY...

16:49.584 --> 16:52.834
BRAIN MATTER MADE A</font>

16:49.584 --> 16:52.834
MISCALCULATION WITH THE SERUM,</font>

16:52.876 --> 16:55.334
AND TURNED INTO</font>

16:52.876 --> 16:55.334
A HIDEOUS VIOLENT BEAST.</font>

16:55.375 --> 16:59.167
WITH AN INSATIABLE APPETITE</font>

16:55.375 --> 16:59.167
FOR HUMAN BRAINS.</font>

16:59.209 --> 17:00.626
MY FREEZING THE MONSTER,

17:00.667 --> 17:02.209
WE WERE ABLE TO NEUTRALIZE

17:00.667 --> 17:02.209
AND SHRINK HIM.

17:02.250 --> 17:04.626
WE STORED HIM HERE UNTIL

17:02.250 --> 17:04.626
WE COULD DEVELOP A CURE.

17:04.666 --> 17:06.334
IF HE IS SO DANGEROUS,

17:06.375 --> 17:08.083
WHY WOULD YOU KEEP HIM

17:06.375 --> 17:08.083
IN A REGULAR FREEZER?

17:08.125 --> 17:10.083
HE WAS HIDDEN BEHIND

17:08.125 --> 17:10.083
THE TOFU-POPS.

17:10.125 --> 17:11.834
WHO WOULD EAT A TOFU-POP?

17:13.083 --> 17:14.541
THE FORCE FIELD

17:13.083 --> 17:14.541
IS STRETCHED TOO THIN

17:14.584 --> 17:16.041
TRYING TO PROTECT ALL OF US.

17:16.083 --> 17:18.041
WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT

17:16.083 --> 17:18.041
A WAY TO FREEZE HIM.

17:18.083 --> 17:19.584
DO YOU HAVE SOME KIND

17:18.083 --> 17:19.584
OF FREEZING CHAMBER

17:18.083 --> 17:19.584
IN THIS HOSPITAL?

17:19.626 --> 17:21.041
( mocking )

17:19.626 --> 17:21.041
DO WE HAVE SOME KIND OF

17:21.083 --> 17:22.500
FREEZING CHAMBER

17:21.083 --> 17:22.500
IN THIS HOSPITAL?

17:22.541 --> 17:24.500
NO.

17:24.541 --> 17:26.500
BUT WE HAVE A FREEZING RAY

17:24.541 --> 17:26.500
IN THE E.R.

17:26.541 --> 17:27.917
ALL RIGHT. LET ME THINK.

17:27.959 --> 17:29.584
OH! I GOT IT. OKAY.

17:29.626 --> 17:32.125
HORACE, LET ME OUT AND I WILL

17:29.626 --> 17:32.125
LURE HIM TO THE FREEZING RAY.

17:32.167 --> 17:34.417
HE'LL RIP YOU APART.

17:32.167 --> 17:34.417
I CAN'T LET YOU DO THAT.

17:34.459 --> 17:36.584
LET HIM. LET HIM!

17:36.626 --> 17:38.918
KAZ, ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?

17:38.959 --> 17:40.584
I'M NEVER SURE

17:38.959 --> 17:40.584
OF ANYTHING I DO,

17:40.626 --> 17:42.959
WHY WOULD I START NOW?

17:45.083 --> 17:47.167
WAIT! WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

17:47.209 --> 17:48.918
WHEN BRAIN MATTER

17:47.209 --> 17:48.918
WORKED IN HIS LAB,

17:48.959 --> 17:50.167
HE ALWAYS LISTENED TO MOZART.

17:50.209 --> 17:51.542
AND HE HATED TO BE DISTURBED.

17:51.584 --> 17:54.292
THE ONE THING THAT

17:51.584 --> 17:54.292
DISTURBED HIS MOST WAS...

17:56.500 --> 17:58.209
HEY, BRIAN MATTER!

17:58.250 --> 18:00.292
( beatboxing )

18:00.334 --> 18:02.417
( roaring )

18:00.334 --> 18:02.417
IT W-- WHOA!

18:02.459 --> 18:03.667
AAH!

18:03.709 --> 18:06.042
( growling )

18:06.083 --> 18:08.584
( people screaming )

18:12.626 --> 18:15.000
HORACE! IS THE FREEZING RAY

18:12.626 --> 18:15.000
READY?

18:15.042 --> 18:16.542
OH, NO! WE'RE OUT OF DRY ICE!

18:16.584 --> 18:18.584
HELP! DO SOMETHING!

18:23.083 --> 18:24.000
AAH!

18:25.584 --> 18:27.000
DON'T EAT MY BRAINS.

18:27.042 --> 18:29.000
OKAY, I'M SORRY ABOUT BEATBOXING

18:29.042 --> 18:30.417
WOULD--DO YOU WANT

18:29.042 --> 18:30.417
TO HEAR SOME MOZART?

18:32.042 --> 18:33.459
I DON'T KNOW ANY MOZART.

18:35.083 --> 18:38.042
SO FOR MY NEXT IMPROVE,

18:35.083 --> 18:38.042
I'M AN ASTRONAUT

18:38.083 --> 18:39.584
IN A SPORTING GOODS STORE

18:39.626 --> 18:41.959
ACTING IN THE STYLE

18:39.626 --> 18:41.959
OF SHAKESPEARE.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
SO... YEAH.

18:44.417 --> 18:46.042
( imitates radio sound )

18:46.083 --> 18:50.626
ME THINKS OUR JOGGING OUTFIT

18:46.083 --> 18:50.626
BEITH OVERPRICED.

18:52.459 --> 18:54.042
ROGER THAT, HOUSTON.

18:55.709 --> 18:57.042
JORDAN, HELP ME OUT HERE.

18:57.083 --> 18:59.042
ARE YOU KIDDING?

18:57.083 --> 18:59.042
YOU'RE DOING HORRIBLE.

18:59.083 --> 19:03.709
OH! TEARS. ACTUAL TEARS OF JOY.

19:05.834 --> 19:07.709
I HAD TO GIVE MY DAD

19:05.834 --> 19:07.709
HIS SUIT BACK.

19:07.751 --> 19:09.125
BUT I GOT ONE FROM MY MOM.

19:10.584 --> 19:13.167
AT LAST!

19:10.584 --> 19:13.167
MY MONSTER HAS RETURNED.

19:15.083 --> 19:16.125
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

19:16.167 --> 19:18.042
I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF MY PLAY.

19:18.083 --> 19:20.459
( panting )

19:18.083 --> 19:20.459
MONSTER. BEATBOXING.

19:20.500 --> 19:21.626
MOZART.

19:21.667 --> 19:23.667
HE ALREADY DID THAT IMPROV.

19:23.709 --> 19:25.125
CHASED ME.

19:25.167 --> 19:27.042
ALL THE WAY FROM MIGHTY MED.

19:27.083 --> 19:28.709
LOST HIM.

19:28.751 --> 19:31.042
( roars )

19:28.751 --> 19:31.042
AAH! DIDN'T LOSE HIM!

19:31.083 --> 19:33.626
( roars )

19:31.083 --> 19:33.626
THAT'S BRAIN MATTER.

19:33.667 --> 19:36.250
HE ACCIDENTALLY TURNED HIMSELF

19:33.667 --> 19:36.250
INTO A BRAIN-EATING MONSTER.

19:36.292 --> 19:38.626
DO SOMETHING!

19:38.667 --> 19:41.542
THE ONLY WAY TO STOP HIM

19:38.667 --> 19:41.542
IS TO FREEZE HIM.

19:41.584 --> 19:43.500
WE CAN PUSH HIM

19:41.584 --> 19:43.500
INTO THE DRY ICE.

19:43.542 --> 19:45.250
OH!

19:43.542 --> 19:45.250
AND I THINK

19:43.542 --> 19:45.250
I KNOW HOW TO DO IT.

19:45.292 --> 19:48.042
THE LOVE OF BRAIN MATTER'S

19:45.292 --> 19:48.042
LIFE WAS HIS LAB ASSISTANT

19:48.083 --> 19:50.334
THE BRILLIANT, BUT HOMELY,

19:48.083 --> 19:50.334
COLLEEN MACKENZIE.

19:50.375 --> 19:52.500
Kaz: OH, THAT'S RIGHT!

19:50.375 --> 19:52.500
HE'S BEEN SEARCHING FOR HER

19:52.542 --> 19:54.292
EVER SINCE SHE DISAPPEARED

19:52.542 --> 19:54.292
ON THAT FOGGY NIGHT.

19:54.334 --> 19:55.709
WE NEED A COLLEEN MACKENZIE!

19:55.751 --> 19:57.125
JORDAN!

19:57.167 --> 19:58.792
NOT HOMELY ENOUGH.

19:57.167 --> 19:58.792
NO.

19:58.834 --> 20:00.000
BUT GUS IS.

20:01.584 --> 20:03.709
GUS, GO STAND BY THE COFFIN!

20:03.751 --> 20:07.042
IF I HAD A DOLLAR FOR

20:03.751 --> 20:07.042
EVERY TIME I HEARD THAT...

20:07.083 --> 20:09.667
Kaz: OH, NO.

20:07.083 --> 20:09.667
THE MONSTER HAS JORDAN.

20:09.709 --> 20:11.125
( Jordan laughing )

20:09.709 --> 20:11.125
THIS PLAY JUST KEEPS GETTING

20:11.167 --> 20:14.042
WORSE AND WORSE.

20:11.167 --> 20:14.042
THIS IS THE BEST DAY EVER.

20:14.083 --> 20:15.709
( roaring )

20:15.751 --> 20:17.209
Kaz: HEY, BRAIN MATTER!

20:15.751 --> 20:17.209
BRAIN MATTER! LOOK, LOOK!

20:17.250 --> 20:19.042
HEY, IT'S COLEEN.

20:19.083 --> 20:20.125
SHE'S RETURNED TO YOU.

20:41.792 --> 20:43.334
IT WORKED!

20:41.792 --> 20:43.334
YES!

20:43.375 --> 20:44.417
AH!

20:44.459 --> 20:46.000
( cheering )

20:52.751 --> 20:55.500
SO, DOES THIS MONSTER GUY

20:52.751 --> 20:55.500
GO TO OUR SCHOOL?

20:55.542 --> 20:57.000
HE'S TOTALLY MY TYPE.

21:04.959 --> 21:06.709
HEY.

21:06.751 --> 21:09.042
SO, TURNS OUT MY DAD

21:06.751 --> 21:09.042
NEVER EVEN SHOWED UP.

21:09.083 --> 21:10.584
AND THIS IS SO TYPICAL.

21:10.626 --> 21:14.209
I WORKED FOR MINUTES

21:10.626 --> 21:14.209
AND MINUTES ON THAT PLAY.

21:14.250 --> 21:15.751
PROBABLY HAD TO WORK LATE AGAIN.

21:15.792 --> 21:18.125
HUH, THAT'S WHAT HE SAID.

21:15.792 --> 21:18.125
HE JUST CALLED.

21:18.167 --> 21:19.792
WHY DO YOU HAVE MY PHONE?

21:19.834 --> 21:21.751
THAT'S WHAT  HE </font> <font face="monospaceSansSerif"> SAID.</font>

21:21.792 --> 21:24.584
ANYWAY, I TOLD HIM THAT
