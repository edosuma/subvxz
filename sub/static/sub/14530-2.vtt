Brody,

03:06.420 --> 03:07.619
associating with known felons

03:07.621 --> 03:08.820
violates the terms of our deal.

03:08.822 --> 03:10.389
Look, I already know.

03:10.391 --> 03:13.425
that Brody Nelson
can no longer do. I got it.

Oh, come on,
Avery.

03:18.666 --> 03:20.499
Look, it's hard enough

03:20.501 --> 03:22.568
to pull on a white hat
and forget everybody.

03:22.570 --> 03:24.803
You want me to ignore my friends
and even my girl?

03:24.805 --> 03:25.971
Especially your girl.

03:25.973 --> 03:28.240
You can't straddle
both worlds, Brody.

03:28.242 --> 03:29.942
It's binary. You have
a choice to make.

03:29.944 --> 03:32.211

03:32.213 --> 03:33.478

03:33.480 --> 03:36.448

03:36.450 --> 03:37.449

03:54.268 --> 03:55.534
No, I'm not grouchy.

04:00.608 --> 04:04.276
How did this morning's chat go

04:04.278 --> 04:05.744
He's now clear

04:05.746 --> 04:06.878
Be patient with
this one, Simon.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.513

04:08.515 --> 04:11.283
Maybe he can spare a bit
of that brilliance on this.

04:11.285 --> 04:12.918
We got a new case.

04:12.920 --> 04:15.621
Virginia field office
sent over some
surveillance footage

04:15.623 --> 04:17.689
and computer diagnostics

04:17.691 --> 04:20.559
of an amusement park
coaster crash.

04:20.561 --> 04:21.760
Got 20 people injured,

04:21.762 --> 04:23.729
four in ICU and one dead.

04:23.731 --> 04:25.731
They already ruled out
mechanical failure?

04:25.733 --> 04:27.766
Richmond PD and
the park engineer

04:27.768 --> 04:30.302
confirmed the brakes,
the track, the coaster cars

04:30.304 --> 04:32.304
were all functioning perfectly.

04:32.306 --> 04:33.272
Do they have a suspect?

04:33.274 --> 04:34.439
Just one.

04:34.441 --> 04:35.674
The coaster's computer.

04:37.510 --> 04:38.977
Which is why
Cyber was called in.

park crash footage

04:41.982 --> 04:43.815

04:43.817 --> 04:45.651
Can you ask Raven
to bring that up?

04:45.653 --> 04:46.718
Ah. Pink.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.654
Nice.

04:48.656 --> 04:49.721
Thank you.

04:49.723 --> 04:50.722
Michelle made it for me.

04:50.724 --> 04:52.057
Made me promise
to wear it

04:52.059 --> 04:53.725
when we're not together,

04:53.727 --> 04:55.494
and on weekends and when I fly

04:55.496 --> 04:56.695
and on her birthday
and my birthday,

04:56.697 --> 04:58.463
and her best friend
Lillian's birthday.

04:58.465 --> 04:59.998
(laughs)
When do you get her back?

05:00.000 --> 05:01.667
Day after tomorrow.

05:01.669 --> 05:04.636
This whole week on, week off
schedule is driving me crazy.

05:04.638 --> 05:06.805
Divorce isn't easy.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.340
Hang in there.

05:08.342 --> 05:10.642
Let's convene
in five minutes.
All right.

05:10.644 --> 05:13.578
They're adding a desk
to the Tear Down Room.

05:14.981 --> 05:15.981
Okay.

05:15.983 --> 05:17.416
So it's official?

05:17.418 --> 05:18.617
New guy's
sticking around?

05:18.619 --> 05:19.618
Who, Nelson?

05:19.620 --> 05:20.619
Looks that way.

05:20.621 --> 05:21.620
Is that a problem,
Krumitz?

05:21.622 --> 05:22.621
Problem? With me?

05:22.623 --> 05:25.057
No, no, I love it.

05:25.059 --> 05:26.558
I'm thrilled and delighted.

05:26.560 --> 05:27.759
I'm tingly all over.

05:38.672 --> 05:43.041
First responders collected
video cameras, smart phones.

05:43.043 --> 05:44.776
Some of this footage
we're seeing

05:44.778 --> 05:46.878
was shot by the victims
at the time of the crash.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.780
Park Security
reported

05:48.782 --> 05:50.649
no known threats
to the park.

05:50.651 --> 05:52.651
There were no
ransom demands.

05:52.653 --> 05:55.687
There was no public
claim of responsibility.

05:55.689 --> 05:58.423
Which means whoever
crashed this coaster

05:58.425 --> 06:00.625
wasn't motivated by
the kind of notoriety

06:00.627 --> 06:02.794
that comes from causing
a tragedy like this.

06:02.796 --> 06:05.530
Raven, pull up the ride's
computer diagnostics.

06:09.902 --> 06:11.737
MUNDO:
This is a 3-D rendering

06:11.739 --> 06:13.805
Thrill Country sent over
of the roller coaster.

06:13.807 --> 06:15.707
A sensor
for every foot of track,

06:15.709 --> 06:16.942
over 100 fail-safes,

06:16.944 --> 06:18.410
all designed to stop the coaster

06:18.412 --> 06:19.811
at the first sign
of an emergency.

06:19.813 --> 06:21.613
All installed for
one ultimate purpose:

06:21.615 --> 06:23.715
prevent a crash.

06:23.717 --> 06:26.051
Which, in this case,
didn't happen.

06:26.053 --> 06:27.719
So all the fail-safes failed?

06:27.721 --> 06:30.021
And all at the same time?
RYAN:
That's not possible.

06:30.023 --> 06:32.791
On this scale, there's
no such thing as a coincidence.

06:32.793 --> 06:34.993
Somebody breached
the roller coaster's computer

06:34.995 --> 06:36.528
and compromised the code.

06:36.530 --> 06:40.065
Making that computer
an accomplice to murder.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.867
Raven, pull up

06:41.869 --> 06:43.668
screen four,
rewind it.

06:43.670 --> 06:46.571
This was shot on the platform,
right before the crash.

06:48.674 --> 06:50.175
The ride was great!

06:50.177 --> 06:52.477
You should have come with us.

06:52.479 --> 06:54.513
MAN:
Sarah Miller...

06:54.515 --> 06:57.749
SARAH:
I knew you two
were up to something.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.551
FRIEND:
Don't look at me!
It was all Alex.

06:59.553 --> 07:01.620
Yes.
YOUNG MAN: It's not stopping.

07:01.622 --> 07:02.954
Hurry, go! Move! Go!
Yes, of course I'll...

07:02.956 --> 07:04.756
(screaming)
Everyone go!

07:04.758 --> 07:05.924
(screaming)

07:07.727 --> 07:10.495
And that was
the young woman who died.

07:10.497 --> 07:12.564
We leave for the
airport in ten.

07:29.482 --> 07:31.817
WOMAN:
<i> I can still hear</i>
<i> the terrified screams,</i>

07:31.819 --> 07:33.452
<i> the sound of the impact.</i>

07:33.454 --> 07:35.153
My sons were in the second car.

07:35.155 --> 07:36.455
Eric broke his wrist,

07:36.457 --> 07:37.456
Kyle cut his legs.

07:37.458 --> 07:38.723
We were lucky.

07:38.725 --> 07:40.892
<i> Others weren't.</i>

07:40.894 --> 07:43.128
We weren't even supposed
to be out here today.

07:43.130 --> 07:45.664
We were just out for a drive
and decided to stop.

07:45.666 --> 07:48.033
It was... it was all so random.

07:49.769 --> 07:51.503
I-- yeah, I was on the platform.

07:51.505 --> 07:53.572
I barely got out of the way.

07:54.574 --> 07:56.641
The two guys next to me,
they didn't.

07:57.743 --> 07:58.877
(sobs)

07:58.879 --> 08:01.980
I don't know what
happened to them.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.748
I don't even know

08:03.750 --> 08:06.651
what hospital they took
my girlfriend to... I...

08:06.653 --> 08:08.220
I gotta... I gotta go find her.

08:08.222 --> 08:11.490
YOUNG MAN:
<i> We were celebrating</i>
<i> Brian's 18th birthday.</i>

08:13.259 --> 08:15.760
I could tell that the car
wasn't gonna stop.

08:17.797 --> 08:21.266
Just ten more minutes and we
were on our way out of the park.

08:21.268 --> 08:23.902
Then my son...

08:23.904 --> 08:26.838
begged for just one more ride.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.607
Just one more ride.

08:28.609 --> 08:29.841
(man sniffs)

08:29.843 --> 08:31.076
I should've said no.

08:31.078 --> 08:33.912
<i> Why didn't I say no?</i>

08:36.983 --> 08:38.850
MUNDO:
Keep this area secure;
we want to check it again.

08:38.852 --> 08:39.985
Dozens of victims

08:39.987 --> 08:41.119
with no apparent
connection

08:41.121 --> 08:42.587
to the park
or each other.

08:42.589 --> 08:44.789
I spoke to the cops,
the park administrators.

08:44.791 --> 08:46.691
Between the two of them,
have exactly zero leads.

08:46.693 --> 08:47.826
(phone rings)

08:47.828 --> 08:49.728
Agent Mundo.

08:51.864 --> 08:53.632
(sighs)

08:53.634 --> 08:55.100
I understand.
Thank you.

08:56.602 --> 08:57.602
Two of the four victims

08:57.604 --> 08:59.204
in critical condition just died.

09:00.172 --> 09:01.606
Crime Scene
processed the scene.

09:01.608 --> 09:02.841
There's no physical
evidence

09:02.843 --> 09:04.743
suggesting the ride
was tampered with.

09:04.745 --> 09:05.877
Witnesses didn't notice anyone

09:05.879 --> 09:07.245
at or near the computer room.

09:07.247 --> 09:10.815
OFFICER:
Sir, you can't be here.
This is a crime scene.

09:10.817 --> 09:12.918
Come on.
I'm-I'm just looking
for something.

09:12.920 --> 09:13.952
Come on.
No, it's gotta be here.

09:13.954 --> 09:14.886
I have to find it.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.655
No, let go of me, please!

09:16.657 --> 09:20.191
Whatever you're looking for,
sir, is probably not here.

09:20.193 --> 09:21.560
Yeah, Crime Scene
already collected

09:21.562 --> 09:22.761
all the evidence yesterday.

09:22.763 --> 09:24.663
It's not evidence.
It's her ring.

09:25.264 --> 09:27.265
Sarah Miller, will you marry me?

09:27.267 --> 09:29.701
I want it back.

09:29.703 --> 09:31.770
I want her to have it.

09:32.805 --> 09:34.639
She should have it.

09:34.641 --> 09:36.341
What's your name?

09:36.343 --> 09:37.709
It's Alex.

09:37.711 --> 09:40.345
How could something
like this happen?

09:40.347 --> 09:42.180
My girlfriend Sarah is dead.

09:42.182 --> 09:43.882
I'm sorry, Alex.

09:43.884 --> 09:45.216
My name's Avery Ryan.

09:45.218 --> 09:47.052

11:11.038 --> 11:12.437
Job's not for everyone.

11:12.439 --> 11:13.805
There's no shame in admitting

11:13.807 --> 11:15.106
you're not man enough
for it.

11:15.108 --> 11:18.209
You know, Krummy,
it just became clear to me

11:18.211 --> 11:21.413
that one day, just one day,

11:21.415 --> 11:23.214
me and you are gonna be besties.

11:23.216 --> 11:25.316
(sighs heavily)

11:25.318 --> 11:27.452
Wow. I'm gonna have
to get back to you on that.

11:27.454 --> 11:29.054
Right now, I'm gonna run

11:29.056 --> 11:30.355
the diagnostic
on the coaster's computer

11:30.357 --> 11:31.790
and find out
why it crashed, okay?

11:31.792 --> 11:33.458
Sound good?
RYAN: What do we know?

11:33.460 --> 11:35.326
A few things. Number one,

11:35.328 --> 11:36.928
it's countdown to washout
for the new guy.

11:36.930 --> 11:38.797
(chuckles)
And two,

11:38.799 --> 11:40.832
the fail-safes on the ride
never engaged

11:40.834 --> 11:42.901
because the coaster's computer
never detected an emergency.

11:42.903 --> 11:44.769
You mean in time to stop
the accident?

11:44.771 --> 11:48.306
According to this diagnostic,
the coaster never crashed.

11:48.308 --> 11:50.775
What?

11:50.777 --> 11:52.811
There's no record
of anything going wrong.

11:52.813 --> 11:54.112
Coaster ran every
required pre-ride check.

11:54.114 --> 11:56.181
Proper functionality
across the board.

11:56.183 --> 11:57.315
Yeah, it's like
it never happened.

11:57.317 --> 11:59.017
But it did.

11:59.019 --> 12:00.719
According to this,
it didn't even detect

12:00.721 --> 12:02.253
a system failure.

12:03.723 --> 12:04.956
What?

12:04.958 --> 12:06.124
Huh?

12:07.259 --> 12:08.393
Uh, nothing.

12:08.395 --> 12:09.494
MUNDO:
You ever see a pit bull

12:09.496 --> 12:10.729
with a chew toy?

12:10.731 --> 12:12.063
You're already in her jaws.

12:12.065 --> 12:13.798
No getting out now. Spill.

12:13.800 --> 12:16.935
as of right now,
it's just a bunch of rumors

12:16.937 --> 12:18.169
and speculation,

12:18.171 --> 12:20.805
but there's been a lot
of talk on the wire

12:20.807 --> 12:22.774
that it was only a matter
of time before someone

12:22.776 --> 12:25.176
would create a source code
allowing them to remotely hack

12:25.178 --> 12:27.145
the coaster,
override the fail-safes

12:27.147 --> 12:28.146
and then crash it.

12:28.148 --> 12:31.082
hackers rush to be
the first to do it.

12:31.084 --> 12:33.251
I hate to burst your hacker
gossip bubble, Nelson,

12:33.253 --> 12:35.520
but this computer
was not remotely hacked.

12:35.522 --> 12:37.222
You sound certain.
'Cause I am.

12:37.224 --> 12:38.757
It's physically impossible
for this computer

12:38.759 --> 12:39.824
to connect to the Internet.

12:39.826 --> 12:40.759
It's been
completely air-gapped.

12:40.761 --> 12:42.227
The park made sure it didn't

12:42.229 --> 12:44.362
have Bluetooth or Wi-Fi
so no one could hack in.

12:44.364 --> 12:45.830
You're saying whoever did this

12:45.832 --> 12:48.032
did it from inside that room,
plugged in.

12:48.034 --> 12:50.001
It was an up-close intrusion?
Yep.

12:50.936 --> 12:52.403
Explains the direction

12:52.405 --> 12:53.905
of that security camera.

12:53.907 --> 12:55.006
My guess is, the
target moved it

12:55.008 --> 12:56.474
before breaching
the control room.

12:56.476 --> 12:58.777
But no signs of forced entry.

12:58.779 --> 13:01.379
Both the door locks and
the keycard reader are intact.

13:01.381 --> 13:03.915
Target let himself in,
inside job.

13:06.519 --> 13:08.019
RAMIREZ: Elijah,
I'm setting up screen-sharing

13:08.021 --> 13:09.220
on your tablet so you can both

13:09.222 --> 13:12.023
see the park's security locks.

13:12.025 --> 13:14.325
Raven, let's go back two days.

13:14.327 --> 13:15.860
Pull up all the activity

13:15.862 --> 13:17.462
on the coaster
control room keypad again.

13:17.464 --> 13:18.563
Let's look

13:18.565 --> 13:21.332
at 2:53 p.m.

13:21.334 --> 13:23.868
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

13:23.870 --> 13:25.537
17 different employees
tried to swipe

13:25.539 --> 13:27.906
into the control room
in one minute?

13:27.908 --> 13:29.240
The security server's clean.

13:29.242 --> 13:30.875
The logs haven't
been tampered with.

13:30.877 --> 13:33.077
That many employees decided
to open the exact same door

13:33.079 --> 13:34.879
at the exact same time?
No.

13:34.881 --> 13:36.314
<i> One denied card's a mistake.</i>

13:36.316 --> 13:38.883
<i> 17 is a concerted effort</i>
<i> to break in.</i>

13:38.885 --> 13:40.518
<i> This was our target.</i>

13:40.520 --> 13:44.422
He didn't know which employee
card would open the door,

13:44.424 --> 13:46.224
<i> so he kept trying</i>
<i> till he hit pay dirt.</i>

13:46.226 --> 13:48.893
Just one problem
with that theory, guys.

13:48.895 --> 13:51.196
According to the park
incidents reports,

13:51.198 --> 13:54.399
no employees have reported cards
being lost or stolen.

13:54.401 --> 13:55.500
Well, he didn't have to steal

13:55.502 --> 13:57.068
the actual card.

13:57.070 --> 13:58.102
Just the information.

13:58.104 --> 13:59.904
This is old school
card skimming.

13:59.906 --> 14:01.372
How many employee entrances
to the park?

14:01.374 --> 14:04.242
Two, each with
its own keycard reader.

14:04.244 --> 14:06.945
Our target doctored them to
steal employee information.

14:06.947 --> 14:09.447
<i> He captured the info</i>
<i> on the dummy device.</i>

14:09.449 --> 14:11.950
<i> Then he made his own cards.</i>

14:11.952 --> 14:13.518
Explains why nobody reported
their cards stolen.

14:13.520 --> 14:14.886
The target hijacked
their information

14:14.888 --> 14:16.221
to gain access
to the control room.

14:16.223 --> 14:19.090
Guys, I've got
something else here.

14:19.092 --> 14:22.961
A week ago, a card was swiped
five consecutive times.

14:22.963 --> 14:24.863
Denied each time.

14:24.865 --> 14:27.999
All right, employees know what
door their card is gonna open.

14:28.001 --> 14:29.968
Why would someone try
to swipe it five times?

14:29.970 --> 14:31.936
He's a former employee.

14:31.938 --> 14:34.606
He was probably checking to
see if it was still active.

14:34.608 --> 14:37.475
Well, according to his file,
he was laid off two months ago.

14:37.477 --> 14:38.977
Nice way of saying "fired."

14:38.979 --> 14:40.311
Get this.

14:40.313 --> 14:42.213
The job he was fired from,

14:42.215 --> 14:43.548
park engineer.

14:43.550 --> 14:45.216
We might be looking
at a motive here.

14:45.218 --> 14:46.951
He's got the technical
proficiency to pull this off.

14:46.953 --> 14:49.187
Let me see if I can get
an employee photo.

14:49.189 --> 14:50.889
Yeah.

14:50.891 --> 14:51.923
Here it is.

14:53.125 --> 14:55.293
Alex Davis.

14:55.295 --> 14:58.263
That's the guy looking
for the ring.

15:03.502 --> 15:04.936
RYAN:<i> Did you hack</i>
<i> the coaster's computer, Alex?</i>

15:04.938 --> 15:06.104
DAVIS:<i> Why would I do that, huh?</i>

15:06.106 --> 15:08.606
Sarah died on that coaster.

15:08.608 --> 15:11.142
And we need to understand
how that happened.

15:11.144 --> 15:12.277
MUNDO:
You were the park engineer

15:12.279 --> 15:14.012
at KLS Attractions.

15:14.014 --> 15:15.446
Why'd they fire you?

15:15.448 --> 15:17.282
I was always late, okay?

15:17.284 --> 15:20.351
My boss could only cut me
so much slack.

15:20.353 --> 15:22.120
I imagine you felt upset.

15:22.122 --> 15:23.621
Yeah, I was mad.

15:23.623 --> 15:26.124
At myself.

15:26.126 --> 15:27.425
Not at him.

15:27.427 --> 15:28.693
Not at the park.

15:28.695 --> 15:30.128
MUNDO:
Then why'd you sneak in

15:30.130 --> 15:31.529
to the park
after you'd been terminated

15:31.531 --> 15:33.298
and try to gain access

15:33.300 --> 15:35.433
to the coaster control room?

15:35.435 --> 15:37.435
I don't, I don't know
what you're talking about.

15:37.437 --> 15:41.205
Your card tried to swipe open

15:41.207 --> 15:43.174
the control room door
a week before the crash.

15:43.176 --> 15:45.576
That wasn't me.

15:45.578 --> 15:47.445
Okay, the day...

15:47.447 --> 15:49.514
that Sarah died was...

15:52.584 --> 15:54.953
...was the first time

15:54.955 --> 15:58.256
I'd been back to Thrill Country

15:58.258 --> 16:00.224
since I'd been fired.

16:00.226 --> 16:03.261
I want to talk about the ride
for a minute.

16:03.263 --> 16:04.495
You weren't on it
when it crashed.

16:04.497 --> 16:05.697
You were on the platform.

16:05.699 --> 16:07.966
I need you to explain why.

16:07.968 --> 16:10.702
Sarah and I first met

16:10.704 --> 16:13.338
on that platform.

16:13.340 --> 16:15.573
She was getting off
a ride with a friend,

16:15.575 --> 16:18.476
and we bumped right
into each other.

16:18.478 --> 16:21.379
I just wanted to recreate
that moment

16:21.381 --> 16:26.050
Who helped you design
your engagement ring?

16:35.094 --> 16:37.462
No one. It was my grandmother's.

16:37.464 --> 16:39.530
(sighs)

16:40.399 --> 16:42.433
Thank you, Alex.

16:44.737 --> 16:48.106
Pupillary constrictions indicate
he's telling the truth.

16:48.108 --> 16:50.641
Micro-expressions signal
he's not masking his feelings.

16:50.643 --> 16:53.244
Alex is innocent.

16:53.246 --> 16:55.446
Why'd you ask about the ring?

16:55.448 --> 16:59.183
I wanted to see his answer
so I could establish a baseline,

16:59.185 --> 17:01.052
make sure that
I was reading him correctly.

17:01.054 --> 17:02.453
I was.

17:02.455 --> 17:04.088
He never would've hurt her.

17:04.090 --> 17:06.758
(sighs) So using Alex's
employee I.D. card

17:06.760 --> 17:09.727
was our target's first attempt
to get into that control room.

17:09.729 --> 17:11.396
He knew that
Alex had access,

17:11.398 --> 17:14.165
And when that card didn't work,
our guy knew

17:14.167 --> 17:15.700
he needed to find any card
to open that door.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.402
Takes a hell of a lot
of planning

17:17.404 --> 17:19.137
to pull off a crash
of this magnitude.

17:19.139 --> 17:21.272
Our target is smart,

17:21.274 --> 17:22.440
patient, determined.

17:22.442 --> 17:24.542
A bank robber,
he cases a branch

17:24.544 --> 17:27.111
so he can get in,
get the money and get out.

17:27.113 --> 17:28.813
He has a goal, a payday.

17:28.815 --> 17:30.448
Well, our target has
a goal, too,

17:30.450 --> 17:32.083
and once we figure out
what that is,

17:32.085 --> 17:34.585
we'll be one step closer
to catching him.

17:42.327 --> 17:44.829
KRUMITZ:
A Bluetooth radio?

17:53.439 --> 17:55.139
Where's Nelson?

17:55.141 --> 17:57.675
I thought he'd benefit from
spending some time with Raven.

17:57.677 --> 17:59.477
Fight it all you want, Krumitz,

17:59.479 --> 18:00.678
Nelson's not going anywhere.

18:00.680 --> 18:02.547
This will become a bromance.

18:02.549 --> 18:03.481
You...

18:03.483 --> 18:04.549
I...

18:04.551 --> 18:06.284
O-Okay.

18:06.286 --> 18:07.718
Well, all right.

18:07.720 --> 18:09.720
I'd like to introduce you
to our murder weapon.

18:09.722 --> 18:10.855
A single-board computer.

18:10.857 --> 18:12.323
Very primitive,

18:12.325 --> 18:14.225
but very powerful,
and more importantly,

18:14.227 --> 18:15.827
not actually part
of the coaster computer.

18:15.829 --> 18:17.361
Should I take a seat for this?

18:17.363 --> 18:18.563
No, I'll be brief

18:18.565 --> 18:20.231
and riveting. Can you take this

18:20.233 --> 18:21.232
to Nelson and Raven?

18:21.234 --> 18:22.366
Thank you.

18:22.368 --> 18:23.534
Okay.

18:23.536 --> 18:24.635
Our target slipped a fake panel

18:24.637 --> 18:27.371
into the programmable
logic controller

18:27.373 --> 18:29.140
<i> and placed the panel</i>
<i> beside the six</i>

18:29.142 --> 18:30.408
<i>that were supposed to be there.</i>

18:30.410 --> 18:34.212
RYAN:<i> And no one noticed</i>
<i> an extra panel?</i>

18:34.214 --> 18:36.347
It's like this.

18:36.349 --> 18:38.816
Wait, wait, wait,
what about the no-food policy?

18:38.818 --> 18:40.852
(laughing):
Oh, that's for everyone else.

18:40.854 --> 18:42.854
Okay, so I always order
a Large and Tasty

18:42.856 --> 18:44.722
from the sub shop
around the corner with bacon,

18:44.724 --> 18:46.657
but the Large and Tasty
doesn't come with bacon.

18:46.659 --> 18:49.260
Something you'd only know if
you're familiar with the menu.

18:49.262 --> 18:50.461
The bacon is disguised

18:50.463 --> 18:52.530
because it looks like part
of the sandwich.

18:52.532 --> 18:55.433
That extra panel looks
exactly like the other six.

18:55.435 --> 18:57.835
So our target was able to hide
the seventh panel in plain sight

18:57.837 --> 18:59.370
because no one knew
to look for it.

18:59.372 --> 19:00.471
That was the bacon.

19:00.473 --> 19:02.206
Exactly, sort of.

19:02.208 --> 19:04.542
How it works. I took
the liberty of adding

19:04.544 --> 19:07.311
a bunch of single-board
computers into the office.

19:07.313 --> 19:08.613
I'm using my cell phone

19:08.615 --> 19:10.648
to tell all the hidden boards
to take control

19:10.650 --> 19:12.850
of the PLCs in the building,
and the lighting system,

19:12.852 --> 19:15.153
CTOC network
and even the elevators.

19:15.155 --> 19:16.387
(beeps)

19:18.223 --> 19:20.224
(elevator bell dings,
Krumitz chuckles)

19:20.226 --> 19:22.593
So your cell phone controls the
programmable logic controller.

19:22.595 --> 19:24.695
Yeah. "I can't get out."

19:24.697 --> 19:26.264
(laughs)
Okay, Krumitz, I get it.

19:26.266 --> 19:27.532
Let them out.

19:27.534 --> 19:28.699
Okay.

19:29.935 --> 19:31.769
You ready
for the scariest part?

19:31.771 --> 19:33.304
A single-board
computer like this

19:33.306 --> 19:35.740
can be found anywhere online
for about 50 bucks

19:35.742 --> 19:37.808
with instructions on how to do
everything you just saw.

19:37.810 --> 19:39.644
But it's got to be
a lot more difficult

19:39.646 --> 19:41.846
to crash a roller coaster
than it is to prank an elevator.

19:41.848 --> 19:43.581
Actually, it's not.

19:43.583 --> 19:45.950
The coding is very similar,

19:45.952 --> 19:48.352
and it's so easy
a nine-year-old could use it.

19:48.354 --> 19:50.221
PLCs control almost everything
you can think of.

19:50.223 --> 19:52.690
So with one of these
single-board computers,

19:52.692 --> 19:55.560
anyone can hack in
and take control of the PLC.

19:55.562 --> 19:57.695
If anyone could be the target,
how do we find him?

19:57.697 --> 19:59.330
I'm keeping my fingers crossed
that when Nelson and Raven

19:59.332 --> 20:00.565
process that board,
they'll find trace

20:00.567 --> 20:01.866
that'll give us a match
within CODIS or AFIS.

20:01.868 --> 20:04.402
You do realize that keeping
your fingers crossed

20:04.404 --> 20:07.872
is rarely, if ever,
effective in fighting crime?

20:07.874 --> 20:09.240
Aware of it.

20:09.242 --> 20:11.509
So, as much as it pains me,

20:11.511 --> 20:13.878
I'm prepared to admit that
my initial theory was wrong.

20:13.880 --> 20:16.547
Our hacker was not in the
control room plugged in

20:16.549 --> 20:17.882
when the crash occurred.

20:17.884 --> 20:20.318
He only accessed the room once
to place the board.

20:20.320 --> 20:22.520
After that, he did everything
that I did in CTOC.

20:22.522 --> 20:23.688
He used a Bluetooth radio

20:23.690 --> 20:25.523
<i> that he attached to the board</i>

20:25.525 --> 20:26.724
<i> to communicate</i>
<i> with the computer</i>

20:26.726 --> 20:28.926
<i> to cause the crash.</i>

20:32.264 --> 20:35.733
The board is our murder weapon,
and now it's our smoking gun.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.635
You said the parks computer
was air-gapped.

20:37.637 --> 20:39.370
Yeah, but the board
that the target

20:39.372 --> 20:40.705
plugged into the
computer wasn't.

20:40.707 --> 20:42.573
The Bluetooth radio on the board

20:42.575 --> 20:44.675
pairs with any device that
knows its unique address

20:44.677 --> 20:45.576
within 60 feet.

20:45.578 --> 20:47.478
(softly):
60 feet.

20:47.480 --> 20:49.714
That's it.

20:49.716 --> 20:52.016
Krumitz, you just uncovered

20:52.018 --> 20:53.851
the target's motive.

20:53.853 --> 20:56.320
Wait, wha-what's the motive?

20:56.322 --> 20:58.489
Okay, you're saying
the target was there

20:58.491 --> 20:59.724
among the crowd
when it happened?

20:59.726 --> 21:02.360
Within 60 feet,
which tells me

21:02.362 --> 21:05.396
our target likes to get up
close and personal-- a voyeur

21:05.398 --> 21:07.698
with a deviant interest
in staging accidents

21:07.700 --> 21:09.767
for his own personal
gratification.

21:09.769 --> 21:10.935
A paraphilia.

21:10.937 --> 21:12.770
Turned on by gore.

21:12.772 --> 21:14.338
Or as we like to
say, "gore-porn."

21:14.340 --> 21:16.674
So the objective
is to witness it,

21:16.676 --> 21:18.509
document it and share it
with a group of others

21:18.511 --> 21:20.544
who get off on it.

21:20.546 --> 21:22.813
And this accident was caused
for the sole purpose

21:22.815 --> 21:25.449
of carnage?
Before computers, pedophiles

21:25.451 --> 21:27.685
used to keep a box of
photos under their bed.

21:27.687 --> 21:30.421
Being geographically isolated
from other pedophiles

21:30.423 --> 21:33.924
forced them to suppress their
socially unacceptable desires.

21:33.926 --> 21:36.427
But today the Internet
connects people

21:36.429 --> 21:37.595
with the same
deviant tendencies.

21:37.597 --> 21:39.797
And once they come together,

21:39.799 --> 21:41.632
they normalize the behavior
and encourage each other.

21:41.634 --> 21:44.869
Crashing a roller coaster,
that is big.

21:44.871 --> 21:47.405
Suggesting the target was
trying to impress somebody.

21:47.407 --> 21:48.906
I mean, in this case,
three people died.

21:48.908 --> 21:50.641
Could've been dozens more.

21:50.643 --> 21:51.876
That's what the target hoped!

21:51.878 --> 21:53.811
As much gore as possible.

21:53.813 --> 21:56.547
I believe that our target is
part of a deviant peer group,

21:56.549 --> 21:59.350
a forum that encourages
violent urges.

21:59.352 --> 22:02.820
Harm innocent people going
about their everyday lives

22:02.822 --> 22:06.624
just to... just to arouse
some sick

22:06.626 --> 22:10.828
You know, I spent the bulk of
my career fighting street gangs.

22:10.830 --> 22:12.863
Cleaning up
after their drive-bys,

22:12.865 --> 22:16.334
drug deals,
and their bloody little wars.

22:16.336 --> 22:19.737
But today we are facing
anonymous targets obsessed

22:19.739 --> 22:23.708
with impressing people
they don't even know!

22:23.710 --> 22:26.344
With encouragement
and recognition

22:26.346 --> 22:27.812
comes escalation.

22:27.814 --> 22:29.914
Simon, I believe our target

22:29.916 --> 22:31.882
is going to strike again.

22:43.729 --> 22:46.564
Glove up!
Looks like we've got blood.

22:46.566 --> 22:49.867
You another one of Avery's
hackers in captivity?

22:49.869 --> 22:51.702
Haven't touched a
computer unsupervised

22:51.704 --> 22:52.870
for two years.

22:52.872 --> 22:54.105
Can't even have
a smart phone.

22:54.107 --> 22:55.740
But honestly

22:55.742 --> 22:57.575
it's the best thing that's
ever happened to me.

22:57.577 --> 23:00.778
Yeah, well, she didn't try
to track you down, huh?

23:00.780 --> 23:02.780
Tell you who you could date?

23:02.782 --> 23:04.882
You think that stuff
just happened to you?

23:04.884 --> 23:07.718
Please, you're
not that special.

23:07.720 --> 23:11.555
Avery was all up
in my business.

23:29.174 --> 23:31.542
MUNDO:
What do you got, guys?

23:31.544 --> 23:34.845
Looks like our target made
an old-school mistake.

23:34.847 --> 23:37.948
We ran the DNA through CODIS
and we got a match.

23:37.950 --> 23:39.183
But there's a problem?

23:39.185 --> 23:40.851
The identity
of whoever deposited

23:40.853 --> 23:43.187
the blood on the board...
is sealed.

23:43.189 --> 23:45.189
By whom?
That's where
it gets interesting.

23:45.191 --> 23:46.857
Us.

23:46.859 --> 23:48.192
The FBI.

23:48.194 --> 23:49.693
(line ringing)
MAN: Yeah.

23:49.695 --> 23:51.195
Hey, I need you to throw
some weight around.

23:51.197 --> 23:53.197
If I'm going to blow
a two-year op by giving you

23:53.199 --> 23:56.033
the sealed name
of a confidential informant,

23:56.035 --> 23:57.868
I'm gonna need more than
a passionate plea, Simon.

23:57.870 --> 23:58.903
Colin,

23:58.905 --> 24:00.671
come on, nobody appreciates

24:00.673 --> 24:04.208
FBI confidentiality
protocol more than I do.

24:04.210 --> 24:05.743
We're both FBI.

24:05.745 --> 24:09.580
Criminal and Cyber
have to work together.

24:09.582 --> 24:11.682
Listen, the target
we are after could be

24:11.684 --> 24:13.584
behind this roller
coaster crash.

24:13.586 --> 24:16.153
I got three dead,
countless injuries.

24:16.155 --> 24:17.822
We believe he
will strike again.

24:17.824 --> 24:21.826
Sorry, Simon,
I can't help you this time.

24:21.828 --> 24:24.895
Now, I have a lot
of work on my desk.

24:24.897 --> 24:26.564
Hey, I heard your
daughter got married.

24:26.566 --> 24:28.599
Yeah. Yeah.

24:28.601 --> 24:29.800
And, uh, I'm still
getting the bills.

24:29.802 --> 24:31.969
Yeah, I'll bet.

24:31.971 --> 24:33.904
Yeah, I'm guessing the best part

24:33.906 --> 24:36.774
was walking her down the aisle

24:36.776 --> 24:38.776
and telling her how
much you love her?

24:38.778 --> 24:39.777
Well, imagine your daughter

24:39.779 --> 24:40.978
dying just weeks
before you got

24:40.980 --> 24:42.746
a chance to do any of that.

24:42.748 --> 24:46.584
You were always
so sentimental, Simon.

24:46.586 --> 24:49.119
I don't have to be.

24:49.121 --> 24:51.722
I can go right over your head.

25:06.605 --> 25:09.139
Ronnie Sloane!

25:15.680 --> 25:17.281
(music playing over headphones)

25:18.283 --> 25:20.551
Ronnie Sloane!

25:24.923 --> 25:27.157
Ronnie Sloane! FBI.
Hands on your head!

25:27.159 --> 25:29.293
Step away from the desk!

25:30.929 --> 25:32.296
Hey! I didn't do anything!

25:32.298 --> 25:33.864
Found your device, Ronnie.

25:33.866 --> 25:36.300
The one you put in that
coaster in Richmond.

25:36.302 --> 25:37.868
The one that made it crash...

25:37.870 --> 25:39.537
and kill three people!

25:39.539 --> 25:41.705
What? I didn't have
anything to do with that.

25:41.707 --> 25:43.674
Then why was your blood

25:43.676 --> 25:45.109
found on this component?

25:45.111 --> 25:46.977
Hey, man, before this
goes any further,

25:46.979 --> 25:49.580
you should know I have
connections at the FBI. I...

25:49.582 --> 25:50.648
Ronnie! Look around.

25:50.650 --> 25:52.049
Your connections...
are they here?

25:52.051 --> 25:54.785
No. But I sure as hell am.

25:54.787 --> 25:57.888
The next words out of
your mouth better explain

25:57.890 --> 26:00.558
why your blood was on the
board that caused that crash.

26:00.560 --> 26:03.961
I-I guess because
I must've made it?

26:03.963 --> 26:07.298
Uh, the tools are sharp,
the components are small.

26:07.300 --> 26:09.934
I prick my fat fingers,
like, all the time, man!

26:09.936 --> 26:11.969
And I make a lot
of boards for people.

26:11.971 --> 26:13.137
Who'd you make this one for?

26:13.139 --> 26:14.238
I have no idea.

26:14.240 --> 26:15.773
I swear.

26:15.775 --> 26:17.975
It's an all cash business.
No names...

26:17.977 --> 26:20.644
no addresses,
no phone numbers.

26:20.646 --> 26:23.314
Unlike you,
I don't ask questions.

26:30.088 --> 26:31.755
The blood trace was a dead end.

26:31.757 --> 26:34.992
I need you to get me into a
black hat forum on the Deep Web.

26:34.994 --> 26:38.062
Whoa. Look, not so easy.

26:38.064 --> 26:39.997
The wire is like a bad
neighborhood-- you got to know

26:39.999 --> 26:42.600
where you're going and
you got to get there fast.

26:42.602 --> 26:45.135
One that caters to those
who are sexually aroused

26:45.137 --> 26:46.971
by extreme carnage.

26:46.973 --> 26:48.973
That's where
our target's lurking.

26:48.975 --> 26:50.674
You got to be invited.

26:50.676 --> 26:52.977
Anyone who doesn't
belong gets the boot.

26:52.979 --> 26:56.780
The forum administrators who
create and run the sites?

26:56.782 --> 26:59.149
They take their exclusivity
very seriously.

26:59.151 --> 27:00.884
They will lock you out,
crash your computer

27:00.886 --> 27:02.052
if they do not want
you on their forums.

27:02.054 --> 27:04.021
Just create an identity,

27:04.023 --> 27:05.189
earn their trust.

27:05.191 --> 27:06.924
Yeah, but it was
my understanding

27:06.926 --> 27:08.359
that according to the deal
keeping me out of jail,

27:08.361 --> 27:10.995
you did tell me that I
couldn't go on the Deep Web

27:10.997 --> 27:12.329
or even associate myself...
Oh, forget that.

27:12.331 --> 27:14.164
We're working on a case.

27:14.166 --> 27:16.000
Just do it.

27:16.002 --> 27:17.167
Okay.

27:17.169 --> 27:19.069
I like the way you roll.

27:19.071 --> 27:21.005
(laughs)

27:43.428 --> 27:46.196
♪ ♪

27:59.711 --> 28:01.445
Naughty99 is the handle
that I've been using

28:01.447 --> 28:03.147
for this gore-porn forum.

28:03.149 --> 28:05.149
Now, the administrator
denied me access.

28:05.151 --> 28:06.750
But I made him think
that I'd been vouched for

28:06.752 --> 28:08.018
by a member, so they let me in.

28:08.020 --> 28:09.119
Wait, wait, wait.

28:09.121 --> 28:11.021
You're telling me
you gained access

28:11.023 --> 28:14.425
to a Deep Web forum
in just a couple of hours?

28:14.427 --> 28:16.193
Yeah.

28:16.195 --> 28:18.729
So I ran an image search
on all the videos

28:18.731 --> 28:20.030
ever uploaded
to the public level and...

28:20.032 --> 28:23.333
All right, so someone
named Otto posted

28:23.335 --> 28:27.104
horrific video
of the coaster crash yesterday.

28:27.106 --> 28:30.774
Hey, this is shot from
the ride's platform.

28:30.776 --> 28:34.111
Get this-- Otto's been active
now on the public forum

28:34.113 --> 28:36.714
for a few months,
but he's been trying

28:36.716 --> 28:38.182
to get invited
to the private forum.

28:38.184 --> 28:40.084
No dice.

28:40.086 --> 28:43.487
The administrator told him
that the roller coaster crash

28:43.489 --> 28:45.756
didn't kill enough people.

28:45.758 --> 28:47.091
Guess there wasn't
enough carnage.

28:47.093 --> 28:48.192
Wait a second here.

28:48.194 --> 28:50.828
Our target was not
already in that forum.

28:50.830 --> 28:54.064
He was generating original
content to try and join it.

28:54.066 --> 28:56.033
Which means he's gonna
do something bigger

28:56.035 --> 28:58.268
to try to prove that
he's worthy of admission.

28:58.270 --> 29:00.838
Something that's gonna put a
lot of innocent lives at risk.

29:00.840 --> 29:03.307
Hold on, look. Someone just
posted to this thread.

29:03.309 --> 29:05.275
It's Otto.

29:05.277 --> 29:07.077
Dude's not playing around.

29:07.079 --> 29:09.146
He's gonna crash
a subway train.

29:12.283 --> 29:14.084
All right, I reviewed
all the footage

29:14.086 --> 29:17.488
checked every area within
60 feet of the computer.

29:17.490 --> 29:19.757
I found nothing odd or
distinctive that could give us

29:19.759 --> 29:20.924
a clue to identify our target.

29:20.926 --> 29:23.127
Anyone holding a control
or a remote?

29:23.129 --> 29:25.262
No. I think the computer was
controlled by a cell phone.

29:25.264 --> 29:26.463
It doesn't draw
attention or stand out.

29:26.465 --> 29:28.465
Allows our target
to keep a low profile.

29:28.467 --> 29:30.100
Mm-hmm, so I figure
we're gonna have to play

29:30.102 --> 29:31.902
this chess match
two moves ahead.

29:31.904 --> 29:35.038
Even if we lure him out, we
can't identify him, except

29:35.040 --> 29:37.274
<i> the Bluetooth radio that</i>
<i> Krumitz pulled from that board</i>

29:37.276 --> 29:39.009
had to have paired with
something for our target

29:39.011 --> 29:41.211
to initiate the crash.
Our target's cell phone.

29:41.213 --> 29:43.180
Exactly! Every Bluetooth device

29:43.182 --> 29:46.216
has its own 12-character
alphanumeric address.

29:46.218 --> 29:49.052
<i> with our target's cell phone,</i>
<i> we now have</i>

29:49.054 --> 29:52.256
<i> our target's</i>
<i> unique Bluetooth address.</i>

29:52.258 --> 29:53.323
<i> So I assigned that address</i>

29:53.325 --> 29:55.025
to our Bluetooth Sniffer.

29:55.027 --> 29:56.827
As soon as we're close to him,
it'll find his signal.

29:56.829 --> 29:58.896
And we nail him.

Nelson's chatting with Otto
on the forum right now.

30:02.835 --> 30:05.102
Otto thinks Nelson
is the forum administrator.

30:05.104 --> 30:06.303
We don't have much time.

30:06.305 --> 30:09.907
in his forum, spot our
fake profile and boot us.

30:09.909 --> 30:13.544
Tell Otto I'm incredibly aroused
by his promise of a spectacle.

30:26.224 --> 30:28.492
Ask Otto when it will happen.

30:34.966 --> 30:37.034
MUNDO:
<i> Three hours?</i>

30:37.036 --> 30:39.203
That's the middle
of the commuter rush

30:39.205 --> 30:42.472
That's when he can create
the most carnage.

30:42.474 --> 30:44.308
Ask him where...
N-No, wait, wait!

30:44.310 --> 30:45.976
Let's not be so direct.

30:45.978 --> 30:47.411
Tell him I'm a commuter.

30:47.413 --> 30:49.279
I want to see it,
not be in it.

30:58.056 --> 31:00.424
He's not responding.
Be patient.

31:00.426 --> 31:02.559
Look, I'm guessing he is
gonna crash those trains

31:02.561 --> 31:05.195
into the barriers at
the end of the line.

31:05.197 --> 31:07.231
It's the only place that he
can guarantee a collision.

31:07.233 --> 31:10.167
So he can capture the
footage of the victims.

31:15.273 --> 31:17.040
The city's Boston.

31:17.042 --> 31:19.042
Simon, the city's Boston;
have them shut it down.

31:19.044 --> 31:21.278
If they ask, tell them
the target told us.

31:21.280 --> 31:24.114
Now we've just got to
get him to meet us.

31:24.116 --> 31:27.484
Ask him if we can watch
the carnage together.

31:37.395 --> 31:39.162
He could be on to us.

31:39.164 --> 31:43.467
You tell him-- if he wants
access to the private forum,

31:43.469 --> 31:46.303
he has to agree to a
face-to-face meeting.

31:52.510 --> 31:54.578
We must have been detected
by the real forum administrator,

31:54.580 --> 31:56.146
and he booted us.

31:56.148 --> 31:57.614
Do you think Otto
will actually show up?

31:57.616 --> 31:59.383
Well, he did seem
pretty suspicious

31:59.385 --> 32:01.084
before the administrator
kicked us off the forum.

32:01.086 --> 32:05.222
As far as Otto knows, he said
no, we kicked him off the forum.

32:05.224 --> 32:07.057
He's a voyeur with
a pathological need

32:07.059 --> 32:12.262
He gets off on watching random
innocents tragically die.

32:12.264 --> 32:14.464
He will be at that
subway in Boston.

32:14.466 --> 32:17.234
The only question
is, which line?

32:22.674 --> 32:24.341
WOMAN: Stephanie,
we have to make this train.

32:24.343 --> 32:25.342
We can't miss it.

32:25.344 --> 32:26.410
Wait! Wait!

32:29.080 --> 32:30.480
Thank you.

32:39.123 --> 32:41.191
RYAN: The governor has shut down
the subway system.

32:41.193 --> 32:43.660
Boston PD, FBI, and
Transportation Authority are

32:43.662 --> 32:46.663
all boarding the trains,
looking for the target's device.

32:46.665 --> 32:48.665
Hey, we just landed.

32:48.667 --> 32:52.035
from Massachusetts Bay
Transportation Authority.

32:52.037 --> 32:54.504
There's a subway train
still moving, yellow line,

32:54.506 --> 32:56.673
loaded with passengers,
blowing through stops.

32:56.675 --> 32:58.175
Call you when I've got more.

32:58.177 --> 32:59.376
Nelson, you're with Elijah.

32:59.378 --> 33:00.711
Krumitz,
you're with me.

33:00.713 --> 33:02.312
Our target accelerated his plan.

33:02.314 --> 33:03.380
He's hacked
into the subway.

33:03.382 --> 33:04.514
He's taking control.

33:04.516 --> 33:05.582
Let's move!

33:07.218 --> 33:09.019
(tires screeching)

33:10.221 --> 33:12.289
(car horns honking,
siren wailing)

33:15.460 --> 33:17.494
(tires screeching)

33:23.302 --> 33:28.305
Nelson, it's kind of hard
to talk and type-- hold on.

33:28.307 --> 33:30.107
Go ahead.

33:30.109 --> 33:31.408
Krumitz, how we looking, bro?

33:31.410 --> 33:33.076
I've linked up
to the city's main control,

33:33.078 --> 33:36.380
that the subway train's already
reached the end of the line.

33:36.382 --> 33:38.348
Once I finish, I'll upload the
code to the Mass Transit server.

33:38.350 --> 33:40.183
Right, which'll automatically
push the code

33:40.185 --> 33:42.019
to all the trains
and stop the subways.

33:42.021 --> 33:44.087
Approaching
Stoneworth Station.

33:44.089 --> 33:45.489
Krumitz,
are you close yet?

33:45.491 --> 33:47.157
No. No, I need another minute.

33:47.159 --> 33:48.658
Yo, E, just keep going, man,
he's not gonna make it

33:48.660 --> 33:50.460
to Stoneworth.
How far to the next
subway station?

33:50.462 --> 33:53.330
Two miles, straight ahead.

33:54.132 --> 33:56.299
(screaming)

33:58.703 --> 34:00.303
(tires screeching)

34:02.507 --> 34:04.374
(horn honking)

34:04.376 --> 34:05.509
Okay, I got it,
I got it.

34:05.511 --> 34:08.645
Nelson, get
to Hillridge Station ASAP.

34:08.647 --> 34:11.448
RYAN: You and Elijah need to get
those people off the train.
Hold on.

34:27.565 --> 34:28.498
(grunts)

34:28.500 --> 34:30.834
Hey!

34:30.836 --> 34:32.736
Come on, come on, get off
quickly, everybody,

34:32.738 --> 34:33.570
come on!

34:33.572 --> 34:34.704
Come on!

34:34.706 --> 34:37.407
(overlapping chatter)

34:37.409 --> 34:39.076
Everybody, come on!

34:41.579 --> 34:42.779
I got you,
come on, follow me.

34:42.781 --> 34:43.780
Wait, wait,
my daughter's on the train.

34:43.782 --> 34:46.249
Stephanie,
oh, my God, Stephanie!

34:46.251 --> 34:47.250
Stay calm!

34:47.252 --> 34:49.486
Everybody
just stay calm!

34:49.488 --> 34:50.854
Stephanie!

34:50.856 --> 34:52.856
Wait, wait!

34:52.858 --> 34:54.558
(overlapping shouting)

34:54.560 --> 34:56.560
My baby, Stephanie!

34:56.562 --> 34:58.328
Wait, w-w-wait,
look, it's gonna be okay.

35:01.833 --> 35:04.134
Avery, Otto just
regained control.

35:04.136 --> 35:05.802
Meet us at the end of the line.

35:10.174 --> 35:12.175
Stephanie, I'm gonna get
you back to your mom.

35:12.177 --> 35:14.511
They're gonna take
good care of you.

35:14.513 --> 35:16.580
Everything's gonna
be okay, I promise.

35:22.720 --> 35:24.621
MAN: I tried that, man,
it doesn't work.

35:26.525 --> 35:31.795
Okay, look inside the panel
in the forward car for the PLC.

35:31.797 --> 35:34.231
You're gonna have to yank
the board out of there.

35:42.907 --> 35:44.674
Where's the train now?
Southvale.

35:44.676 --> 35:46.209
He's only got two stops left.

35:46.211 --> 35:47.544
(tires screeching)

35:52.850 --> 35:54.518
PLC's not in the control panel.

35:54.520 --> 35:56.920
Okay, it must be an older car.

35:56.922 --> 35:58.622
Uh, there's another place
it might be,

35:58.624 --> 36:00.457
but you're not gonna like it.

36:00.459 --> 36:02.926
You need to look outside
underneath the last train car.

36:02.928 --> 36:04.661
You're right, I don't like it.

36:34.392 --> 36:36.760
♪ ♪

37:00.618 --> 37:03.453
♪ ♪

37:25.643 --> 37:28.245
I removed the target's board,
but the train's not stopping.

37:28.247 --> 37:29.746
Damn it. It must still be paired

37:29.748 --> 37:31.748
to the train's computer
over Bluetooth.

37:31.750 --> 37:35.485
remove the Bluetooth radio
from the motherboard.

37:35.487 --> 37:36.987
You'll find it in the USB port.

37:39.657 --> 37:41.558
No time to be delicate.

37:51.836 --> 37:52.969
Did you find him?

37:52.971 --> 37:54.037
Not yet.

37:56.607 --> 37:57.841
W-Whoa, wait.

38:02.413 --> 38:03.546
It should be here.

38:06.917 --> 38:07.884
Aah, he ditched
the phone.

38:07.886 --> 38:08.918
Krumitz, you
secure that exit.

38:25.636 --> 38:29.339
Nice to meet you, Otto.

38:37.615 --> 38:38.481
Get him out of here.

38:43.020 --> 38:43.720
Stephanie!

38:43.722 --> 38:45.955
Stephanie!
Mom!

38:47.658 --> 38:49.793
NELSON: Man, I never
thought I'd see the day

38:49.795 --> 38:54.564
(chuckles) You know, taking down
hats, traveling in style.

38:54.566 --> 38:56.599
Better get used to it.

38:56.601 --> 38:57.734
Krummy, wait up.

38:57.736 --> 38:59.502
Look, y-you busy
right now?

38:59.504 --> 39:04.841
And we're definitely
not gonna watch

39:04.843 --> 39:05.842
a romantic
comedy together.

39:05.844 --> 39:06.876
I'm not your
boyfriend.

39:06.878 --> 39:09.045
Besides, we have
paperwork to do.

39:12.817 --> 39:14.884
(knocking on window)

39:17.722 --> 39:18.988
Daddy!
Michelle!

39:19.990 --> 39:21.991
(sighs)

39:21.993 --> 39:24.060
It's so good
to see you.

39:26.030 --> 39:27.030
So, how are you?

39:27.032 --> 39:28.031
How was school?

39:28.033 --> 39:29.032
You don't have
my bracelet.

39:29.034 --> 39:31.134
You know what,
I had to use it.

39:31.136 --> 39:34.838
It helped me save a
lot of people today.

39:34.840 --> 39:35.972
Really?

39:35.974 --> 39:37.107
Mm-hmm.

39:37.109 --> 39:39.109
Don't worry.

39:39.111 --> 39:40.443
I'll make you
another one.

39:40.445 --> 39:41.511
You will?!

39:48.986 --> 39:52.655
Is this always a part of our
job-- filling out paperwork?

39:52.657 --> 39:54.758
Yes, it's called an
after-action report.

39:54.760 --> 39:56.760
Now, nobody said you
had to stay-- I got it.

39:56.762 --> 39:58.762
I know what you're trying to do.
You're trying to get me to leave

39:58.764 --> 40:00.096
so you can cut me out
your version of the takedown.

40:00.098 --> 40:01.097
You think you're slick.

40:01.099 --> 40:04.100
You were in a different
subway station entirely.

40:04.102 --> 40:06.136
"On the phone with Agent Daniel
Krumitz, Brody Nelson said..."

40:06.138 --> 40:06.903
No, no, uh-uh.

40:06.905 --> 40:08.405
I never said that.

40:08.407 --> 40:09.839
Black people do not use
the word "pal."

40:09.841 --> 40:11.641
You ever heard the word
"pal" in a rap song?

40:11.643 --> 40:15.111
I did not ask for your
input on my report, pal.
(phone buzzing)

40:15.113 --> 40:17.814
(groans)

40:17.816 --> 40:19.449
How much time you think
Otto's gonna get?

40:19.451 --> 40:20.183
Well, he committed murder,

40:20.185 --> 40:21.751
attempted murder,

40:21.753 --> 40:23.920
then there's the computer fraud
and the abuse,

40:23.922 --> 40:25.155
and according
to U.S. Statute 2703,

40:25.157 --> 40:27.023
I'd say he's looking
at a bunch of time.

40:27.025 --> 40:30.059
Anyone in the mood
for some pizza?
(phone buzzing)

40:30.061 --> 40:31.761
Can you please put
your phone on silent?

40:31.763 --> 40:34.030
I've been listening to that
thing buzz for the past hour.

40:34.032 --> 40:34.864
Who's blowing up Nelson?

40:34.866 --> 40:35.965
NELSON:
No one.

40:35.967 --> 40:38.802
Certainly not no one.

40:38.804 --> 40:41.738
I thought Avery told you
to ditch her.

40:41.740 --> 40:44.140
She did; I'm just
not sure what to say.

40:44.142 --> 40:45.975
You unsure what to say?

40:45.977 --> 40:47.777
Look, Krummy, this is tough,
it's not like I can tell her

40:47.779 --> 40:50.780
Well, you can tell her that
you're moving out of state.

40:50.782 --> 40:54.784
Baby girl will hack my
computer, steal my identity,

40:54.786 --> 40:56.553
and spend half the money
in my bank account

40:56.555 --> 40:57.620
before I can
finish a sentence.

40:57.622 --> 41:00.490
if she hacks your computer,
we can just arrest her.

41:00.492 --> 41:01.891
There you go,
problem solved.
Krumitz.

41:01.893 --> 41:03.560
What? I'm just saying.

41:03.562 --> 41:04.828
(phone buzzes, Nelson groans)

41:04.830 --> 41:06.162
Well, I am starving.

41:06.164 --> 41:07.464
You hungry?

41:07.466 --> 41:09.799
Yes, let's go get some food.

41:11.735 --> 41:13.803
(phone buzzing)

41:27.852 --> 41:30.053
Hello.

41:30.055 --> 41:32.755
Uh, no, he-he's unavailable
right now.

41:33.724 --> 41:35.792
A colleague.

41:36.760 --> 41:38.828
Well, you have
a sexy voice, too.

41:39.797 --> 41:42.565
I'm Daniel.

41:42.567 --> 41:45.235
Well, it's nice to meet you,
Monique.

41:45.237 --> 41:47.770
(laughs) Can you pick me up?
I don't have a car.
