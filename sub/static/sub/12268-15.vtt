WEBVTT

00:01.332 --> 00:02.733
PREVIOUSLY ON "REVENGE"...

00:02.733 --> 00:04.105
(Trask) Helen's no longer
with us, but your orders remain.

00:04.105 --> 00:07.007
Deliver the program
in its finished form,

00:07.007 --> 00:08.279
or your father dies.

00:08.279 --> 00:09.640
I NEED PROOF THAT YOU HAVEN'T
KILLED HIM ALREADY.

00:09.640 --> 00:10.681
CHECK THE FINGERPRINT.

00:12.383 --> 00:13.414
NO.

00:13.414 --> 00:15.746
HEY, JACK, NICE DAY
FOR A SAIL, HUH?

00:15.746 --> 00:17.048
AMANDA STOLE MY COMPUTER,

00:17.048 --> 00:18.149
SO I THOUGHT SHE COULD
THREATEN CONRAD

00:18.149 --> 00:19.450
INTO SELLING BACK
THE STOWAWAY.

00:19.450 --> 00:21.052
NATE GOT NOTHING.

00:21.052 --> 00:24.055
I'LL SEE TO IT THAT GIRL
CAN NEVER COME AFTER ME AGAIN.

00:24.055 --> 00:25.356
GO. LET'S GO.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.099
UHH!
 JACK!

00:28.099 --> 00:29.260
I LOVE YOU, JACK.

00:29.260 --> 00:30.761
NO. AMANDA.

00:30.761 --> 00:32.302
YOU HAVE TO GET HIM
TO A HOSPITAL.

00:32.302 --> 00:33.634
I CAN'T LEAVE AMANDA.

00:33.634 --> 00:35.066
MY NECKLACE.

00:35.066 --> 00:37.068
AMANDA, NO!

00:37.068 --> 00:38.139
(gasps)

00:38.139 --> 00:40.541
EMILY, GET DOWN!

00:40.541 --> 00:42.543
TAKE CARE OF JACK
AND MY BABY.

00:42.543 --> 00:44.745
(sobbing)

00:48.779 --> 00:51.082
(Emily) IN ITS PUREST FORM,

00:51.082 --> 00:56.227
AN ACT OF RETRIBUTION
 PROVIDES SYMMETRY...

00:56.227 --> 01:00.761
THE RENDERING OF PAYMENT FOR
 CRIMES AGAINST THE INNOCENT.

01:03.634 --> 01:05.135
BUT THE DANGER OF RETALIATION

01:05.135 --> 01:08.599
LIES IN FURTHERING
 THE CYCLE OF VIOLENCE.

01:10.171 --> 01:13.774
STILL, IT'S A RISK
 THAT MUST BE MET...

01:13.774 --> 01:15.476
WHEN THE GREATER OFFENSE

01:15.476 --> 01:18.149
IS TO ALLOW THE GUILTY
 TO GO UNPUNISHED.

01:19.780 --> 01:22.453
EMS, SLOW DOWN.
TAKE A BREATH.

01:22.453 --> 01:25.656
I TOOK A BREATH,
AND NOW AMANDA'S DEAD.

01:25.656 --> 01:27.658
LOOK, NATE HAD EVERY REASON
TO GO AFTER JACK AND AMANDA.

01:27.658 --> 01:29.790
WE DO NOT KNOW THAT
THE GRAYSONS ORDERED THIS.

01:29.790 --> 01:31.822
DON'T YOU DARE
DEFEND THEM. (panting)

01:31.822 --> 01:34.565
ALL I'M ASKING YOU TO DO
IS PRESS PAUSE.

01:34.565 --> 01:37.828
TERRIBLE THINGS ARE HAPPENING
TO THE PEOPLE YOU CARE ABOUT.

01:37.828 --> 01:39.330
I KNOW THAT'S NOT
WHAT YOU WANTED

01:39.330 --> 01:40.831
WHEN YOU STARTED THIS.

01:40.831 --> 01:42.173
I DIDN'T START THIS, NOLAN.
THEY DID.

01:42.173 --> 01:43.504
AND IF YOU
DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT YET,

01:43.504 --> 01:44.835
I DON'T NEED YOU BY MY SIDE.

01:44.835 --> 01:46.137
WHOA, WHOA, WAIT.
SO WHAT, YOU'RE GONNA JUST

01:46.137 --> 01:47.638
MARCH OVER THERE
AND SHOOT THE GRAYSONS?

01:47.638 --> 01:49.180
I NEED TO GET TO THE HOSPITAL.

01:49.180 --> 01:51.742
EMS, WE HAVE TO WAIT TILL
SOMEONE CALLS US ABOUT JACK,

01:51.742 --> 01:53.784
OTHERWISE, THEY WILL KNOW
THAT WE WERE THE ONES

01:53.784 --> 01:55.286
THAT PULLED HIM
OUT OF THE WATER.

01:55.286 --> 01:56.587
HEY.
 (exhales)

01:56.587 --> 01:58.819
YOU NEED TO SLOW DOWN
AND REST.

01:58.819 --> 02:00.821
AND AS FAR AS ME
STICKING BY YOUR SIDE,

02:00.821 --> 02:03.824
I THINK YOU KNOW BY NOW,
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

02:03.824 --> 02:05.526
THEN DON'T EVER TELL ME
TO LET GO

02:05.526 --> 02:06.897
OR TO EASE UP
OR TO FORGIVE,

02:06.897 --> 02:08.859
NOT WHEN I AM STANDING HERE
COVERED IN THE BLOOD

02:08.859 --> 02:10.860
OF ONE OF THE ONLY PEOPLE
THAT I EVER LOVED.

02:10.860 --> 02:12.203
(door opens)

02:12.203 --> 02:13.404
WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN?

02:13.404 --> 02:14.635
AMANDA'S DEAD.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.567
WHAT? HOW? EMILY.

02:16.567 --> 02:17.708
GIVE HER A MINUTE.

02:17.708 --> 02:19.540
(exhales)

02:19.540 --> 02:21.512
(exhales)

02:30.681 --> 02:34.485
(crying) OH, MY GOD.
 I'M SO SORRY.

02:34.485 --> 02:37.188
DON'T BE.

02:37.188 --> 02:38.859
YOU'VE GIVEN ME
 THE ONE THING

02:38.859 --> 02:42.563
I THOUGHT
 I'D NEVER HAVE...

02:42.563 --> 02:44.495
A REAL FAMILY.

02:49.900 --> 02:51.872
(sniffles)

03:12.423 --> 03:13.924
(sniffles)

03:13.924 --> 03:16.927
(crying)

03:21.472 --> 03:24.375
You've reached Nate.
 You know what to do.

03:24.375 --> 03:25.706
(voice mail beeps)
 DAMN IT.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.678
(cell phone beeps)
 WHERE THE HELL IS HE?

03:27.678 --> 03:29.810
WAS THAT TRASK?
WHAT DID HE SAY?

03:29.810 --> 03:31.782
NO, IT WASN'T TRASK.
HE HASN'T MADE CONTACT.

03:31.782 --> 03:33.714
SO WE HAVE NO IDEA
IF THE INITIATIVE

03:33.714 --> 03:35.716
IS BUYING OUR STORY
ABOUT AMANDA CLARKE?

03:35.716 --> 03:37.388
OUR STORY HAPPENS TO BE
THE TRUTH.

03:37.388 --> 03:38.849
THE COMPUTER
SHE THREATENED ME WITH

03:38.849 --> 03:40.721
IS AS REAL AS THE JEOPARDY
WE'RE IN

03:40.721 --> 03:42.323
AS LONG AS IT REMAINS
OUT THERE.

03:42.323 --> 03:45.396
THEN NOTHING'S CHANGED.

03:45.396 --> 03:46.897
AFTER ALL THE PLOTTING,
SCHEMING, AND MURDER,

03:46.897 --> 03:48.499
THIS FAMILY'S
IN AS MUCH DANGER AS EVER.

03:48.499 --> 03:50.431
NO, WE DON'T KNOW THAT
EITHER.

03:50.431 --> 03:52.463
I MEAN, NO NEWS IN THIS CASE
COULD VERY WELL BE GOOD NEWS.

03:52.463 --> 03:53.604
(Declan)
THEY GOT HIM THROUGH SURGERY,

03:53.604 --> 03:54.805
AND THEY TOOK THE BULLET OUT,

03:54.805 --> 03:55.966
BUT THAT'S ALL THEY'LL
TELL ME ON THE PHONE.

03:55.966 --> 03:57.338
CHARLOTTE, WHAT'S HAPPENED?
 (door opens)

03:57.338 --> 03:58.469
JACK'S BEEN SHOT.

03:58.469 --> 03:59.610
OH, MY GOD.

03:59.610 --> 04:00.841
MOM, I NEED YOU
TO WATCH CARL.

04:00.841 --> 04:03.013
NO, OF COURSE.
WHERE'S AMANDA?

04:03.013 --> 04:04.815
WE DON'T KNOW. SHE HASN'T
CHECKED IN AT THE HOSPITAL,

04:04.815 --> 04:06.317
AND SHE'S NOT ANSWERING
HER PHONE.

04:06.317 --> 04:08.018
I HAVE TO GO.

04:09.780 --> 04:10.951
(door closes)

04:10.951 --> 04:12.653
ALL PART OF THE PLAN?

04:12.653 --> 04:14.725
EXACTLY HOW MUCH BLOOD
ARE YOU TWO COMFORTABLE WITH?

04:14.725 --> 04:15.926
'CAUSE I JUST HIT
MY LIMIT.

04:15.926 --> 04:17.358
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER,

04:17.358 --> 04:18.928
I'M SHUTTING
THESE BARBARIANS DOWN.

04:18.928 --> 04:20.291
DANIEL, WAIT.

04:20.291 --> 04:22.963
(cell phone rings,
door opens)

04:22.963 --> 04:24.935
(ring, door closes)

04:24.935 --> 04:26.467
ANSWER IT.

04:26.467 --> 04:28.539
(rings and beeps)

04:28.539 --> 04:29.940
YES?

04:29.940 --> 04:31.642
(Trask) We were able

04:31.642 --> 04:33.804
TO RECOVER MS. CROWLEY'S PHONE
AND HER SCARF

04:33.804 --> 04:35.806
and a great deal of blood.

04:35.806 --> 04:38.909
UH, AND WAS IT AMANDA CLARKE?

04:38.909 --> 04:40.781
WE'RE RESERVING JUDGMENT
TILL WE LOCATE HER.

04:40.781 --> 04:41.952
AND THE COMPUTER?

04:41.952 --> 04:43.454
Still at large,

04:43.454 --> 04:44.915
ASSUMING IT EXISTS AT ALL.

04:44.915 --> 04:48.489
MY INSPECTION OF MS. CLARKE'S
PREMISES WAS INCOMPLETE.

04:48.489 --> 04:51.762
MR. TRASK, THERE'S SOMETHING
WE NEED TO DISCUSS FACE-TO-FACE.

04:51.762 --> 04:53.324
WE'LL COME TO YOU.

04:53.324 --> 04:54.995
(line disconnects)

04:54.995 --> 04:56.667
(beep)

04:56.667 --> 04:59.730
WHAT HAVE THEY DONE?

04:59.730 --> 05:02.032
IT'S WHAT I'VE DONE.

05:02.032 --> 05:03.704
MORE TO THE POINT,

05:03.704 --> 05:05.836
IT'S WHAT ONE NATE RYAN
HAS DONE.

05:05.836 --> 05:08.709
WHO THE HELL
IS NATE RYAN?

05:10.941 --> 05:12.843
SO JUST TO RECAP...

05:12.843 --> 05:14.815
AMANDA'S DEAD,
JACK COULD BE DYING,

05:14.815 --> 05:16.687
PADMA'S FATHER'S
BEING TORTURED,

05:16.687 --> 05:18.489
AND THE ONLY WAY TO KEEP HIM
FROM BEING KILLED OUTRIGHT

05:18.489 --> 05:20.751
IS TO HAND OVER A POTENTIALLY
LETHAL COMPUTER PROGRAM

05:20.751 --> 05:21.922
THAT ONLY I CAN COMPLETE.

05:21.922 --> 05:23.854
AM I MISSING ANYTHING?
 NO.

05:23.854 --> 05:24.995
WHY DO I GET THE FEELING

05:24.995 --> 05:26.527
THIS ISN'T
WHAT TAKEDA HAD IN MIND

05:26.527 --> 05:28.429
WHEN HE HANDED YOU
YOUR REVENGE DEGREES?

05:28.429 --> 05:30.030
THIS IS NOT THE TIME
TO LOSE FAITH.

05:30.030 --> 05:32.433
WHEN EXACTLY
IS THE TIME, AIDEN?

05:32.433 --> 05:34.765
I HAVE NEVER SEEN HER
LIKE THIS BEFORE.

05:34.765 --> 05:36.567
I DON'T KNOW IF EMILY'S
IN CONTROL ANYMORE.

05:36.567 --> 05:37.738
IT'S GOTTA STOP.

05:37.738 --> 05:39.109
THIS CAN'T STOP.

05:39.109 --> 05:41.111
EMILY'S NEED FOR REVENGE
IS ALL SHE HAS LEFT RIGHT NOW.

05:41.111 --> 05:42.913
YOU TAKE THAT AWAY,
AND I PROMISE YOU,

05:42.913 --> 05:44.415
WE WILL LOSE HER, TOO.

05:44.415 --> 05:46.447
CHARLOTTE JUST CALLED.

05:46.447 --> 05:48.649
JACK'S OUT OF SURGERY.

05:48.649 --> 05:50.020
I'M GOING OVER THERE.

05:50.020 --> 05:51.622
WHAT DO YOU NEED ME TO DO?

05:51.622 --> 05:52.953
CONTINUE HUNTING DOWN
THE INITIATIVE.

05:52.953 --> 05:54.084
NOW THAT CONRAD'S RUNNING
FOR GOVERNOR,

05:54.084 --> 05:55.626
HE'LL BE FORCED
TO VACATE HIS SEAT

05:55.626 --> 05:56.927
ON GRAYSON GLOBAL'S BOARD,

05:56.927 --> 05:58.429
WHICH MEANS THAT YOU CAN GET
CLOSER TO DANIEL

05:58.429 --> 06:00.431
AND FINALLY
GET RID OF HELEN CROWLEY.

06:00.431 --> 06:01.932
I THINK SOMEONE MAY HAVE ALREADY
BEAT ME TO THAT.

06:01.932 --> 06:03.133
THE PHONE'S BEEN DISCONNECTED,

06:03.133 --> 06:05.596
AND PADMA'S ALREADY BEEN
ASSIGNED A NEW CONTACT.

06:05.596 --> 06:07.367
THEN SEE IF YOU CAN FIND OUT
WHAT HAPPENED TO HER.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.839
WHAT, YOU THINK
IT'S THE GRAYSONS?

06:08.839 --> 06:10.140
WHO ELSE?

06:10.140 --> 06:12.903
(jangles keys)

06:12.903 --> 06:15.606
ARE YOU COMING, NOLAN?

06:15.606 --> 06:16.807
GO.

06:21.852 --> 06:23.454
(indistinct conversations,
monitor beeping)

06:23.454 --> 06:24.615
HOW IS HE?

06:24.615 --> 06:25.956
WELL, HE'S LUCKY
TO BE ALIVE.

06:25.956 --> 06:27.087
THE DOCTOR SAID,
2 MILLIMETERS TO THE LEFT,

06:27.087 --> 06:28.619
IT WOULD'VE GONE THROUGH
HIS LIVER.

06:28.619 --> 06:29.960
DO THEY KNOW WHAT HAPPENED?

06:29.960 --> 06:31.462
YEAH, THE COAST GUARD
FOUND JACK'S BOAT

06:31.462 --> 06:32.963
AT THE BOTTOM OF
LONG ISLAND SOUND

06:32.963 --> 06:34.465
ALONG WITH NATE RYAN'S BODY.

06:34.465 --> 06:35.896
AND THERE'S STILL NO WORD
ON AMANDA.

06:35.896 --> 06:38.499
I'M SO SORRY.

06:38.499 --> 06:40.571
I'M GONNA GO HOME
AND CHECK ON CARL.

06:40.571 --> 06:42.933
UH,
CARL'S AT GRAYSON MANOR?

06:42.933 --> 06:45.476
I COULDN'T GET THE A.C. FIXED
LAST NIGHT AT THE BAR,

06:45.476 --> 06:47.478
AND WHEN VICTORIA SAW
HOW OVERHEATED THE BABY WAS,

06:47.478 --> 06:48.879
SHE OFFERED A ROOM.

06:48.879 --> 06:52.613
I NEED COFFEE. CAN YOU GUYS
JUST KEEP AN EYE ON HIM?

06:52.613 --> 06:53.914
(telephone ringing in distance)

06:53.914 --> 06:55.746
VICTORIA JUST POPS IN
TO THE STOWAWAY,

06:55.746 --> 06:57.848
LAST NIGHT OF ALL NIGHTS?

06:57.848 --> 06:58.819
THAT'S QUITE A COINCIDENCE.

06:58.819 --> 06:59.990
I TOLD YOU,

06:59.990 --> 07:03.754
THE GRAYSONS
ARE BEHIND ALL OF THIS.

07:03.754 --> 07:05.896
AND THEY'RE GONNA PAY.

07:24.815 --> 07:26.817
THIS IS AN UNUSUAL CHOICE
OF VENUE.

07:26.817 --> 07:28.479
IT DOESN'T OFFER
MUCH SECURITY.

07:28.479 --> 07:29.950
FOR YOU OR FOR ME?

07:29.950 --> 07:32.783
THE LAST MEETING YOU CALLED
WITH ONE OF OUR OPERATIVES,

07:32.783 --> 07:35.085
SHE VANISHED WITHOUT A TRACE.

07:35.085 --> 07:37.988
WE TOLD YOU THAT WE DIDN'T
HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT.

07:37.988 --> 07:38.959
YES.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.491
ACCORDING TO YOU,
SHE FELL PREY

07:40.491 --> 07:41.832
TO ONE ANGRY LITTLE GIRL

07:41.832 --> 07:43.133
WHO, AS SERENDIPITY
WOULD HAVE IT,

07:43.133 --> 07:45.095
HAS NOW DISAPPEARED HERSELF.

07:45.095 --> 07:47.798
I'M SURE YOU KNOW BY NOW
THAT WHAT HAPPENED ON THAT BOAT

07:47.798 --> 07:49.670
WAS NO ACCIDENT.

07:49.670 --> 07:52.002
A LOW-LEVEL CRIMINAL
NAMED NATE RYAN

07:52.002 --> 07:53.674
HAD A VENDETTA AGAINST
THE GROOM,

07:53.674 --> 07:55.506
AND APPARENTLY SOUGHT TO
TERRORIZE THE BOTH OF THEM

07:55.506 --> 07:56.677
ON THEIR HONEYMOON.

07:56.677 --> 07:57.908
HOW DO YOU KNOW ALL THIS?

07:57.908 --> 08:00.110
BECAUSE HE CALLED ME
FROM THE BOAT.

08:00.110 --> 08:03.654
TRICKED ME INTO CONFIRMING
THE EXISTENCE OF THE COMPUTER.

08:03.654 --> 08:04.855
TO WHAT END?

08:04.855 --> 08:06.957
FINANCIAL REWARD.

08:06.957 --> 08:09.690
IN A PLEA FOR THEIR LIVES,
MS. CLARKE OFFERED

08:09.690 --> 08:12.262
ALL THE EVIDENCE AGAINST US
AS RANSOM.

08:12.262 --> 08:13.924
SO WE SHOULD EXPECT
THE COMPUTER

08:13.924 --> 08:15.526
TO BE RAISED
WITH THE WRECKAGE?

08:15.526 --> 08:17.868
UNFORTUNATELY,
WE'RE NOT EXPERTS

08:17.868 --> 08:20.701
IN MARINE SALVAGE,
MR. TRASK.

08:20.701 --> 08:22.903
I'M SURE THE TIDES HAVE
A MIND OF THEIR OWN.

08:22.903 --> 08:24.134
MM.

08:24.134 --> 08:26.577
ALL YOUR PROBLEMS
WRAPPED UP WITH A PRETTY BOW.

08:26.577 --> 08:27.878
NOT ALL OF THEM.

08:27.878 --> 08:30.541
AND NOT AS LONG AS YOU CONTINUE
TO EXPLOIT OUR SON

08:30.541 --> 08:32.943
AS PROXY TO WHATEVER IT IS
YOU'RE PLANNING.

08:32.943 --> 08:35.846
SOMETHING YOU'D DO WELL
TO REMEMBER.

08:40.120 --> 08:43.854
I DON'T THINK
HE BOUGHT YOUR STORY.

08:43.854 --> 08:46.997
WELL, ASSUMING MS. CLARKE
HAS INDEED MET HER FATE,

08:46.997 --> 08:49.900
THERE'S ONLY ONE PERSON ALIVE
WHO CAN REFUTE IT.

08:49.900 --> 08:51.862
JACK PORTER.

08:53.934 --> 08:55.636
(horn honks,
siren wailing in distance)

08:58.138 --> 08:59.539
(key clicks)

08:59.539 --> 09:01.041
(intercom beeps)

09:01.041 --> 09:03.774
(Grace) Mr. Grayson, there's
a Mr. Trask on line two for you.

09:03.774 --> 09:04.915
Says he's the new liaison

09:04.915 --> 09:07.878
for Helen Crowley's
investment group.

09:07.878 --> 09:09.049
PUT HIM THROUGH.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.781
(telephone rings)

09:10.781 --> 09:13.954
MR. TRASK, DANIEL GRAYSON.

09:13.954 --> 09:16.987
I UNDERSTAND YOU'LL BE
TAKING OVER FOR HELEN CROWLEY.

09:16.987 --> 09:19.960
SO FAR AS A WOMAN
LIKE HELEN CAN BE REPLACED.

09:19.960 --> 09:22.132
I TRUST SHE'S ALL RIGHT.

09:22.132 --> 09:24.164
SHE'S MOVED ON
TO GREENER PASTURES,

09:24.164 --> 09:27.037
THOUGH SHE ALWAYS SPOKE
QUITE HIGHLY OF YOU,

09:27.037 --> 09:28.568
which is why we've elected

09:28.568 --> 09:29.970
to keep our business
at Grayson Global.

09:29.970 --> 09:31.872
WELL, I-I APPRECIATE THAT.

09:31.872 --> 09:33.043
If you'll check your inbox,

09:33.043 --> 09:34.945
you'll find a purchase request.
 (ticking)

09:34.945 --> 09:37.047
The sooner you're able to make
 these trades, the better.

09:37.047 --> 09:39.049
WELL, I'LL HAVE A LOOK
THIS AFTERNOON.

09:39.049 --> 09:40.651
WONDERFUL.
WE'LL BE IN TOUCH.

09:40.651 --> 09:41.812
(cell phone beeps)

09:46.617 --> 09:49.620
(telephone ringing in distance)

09:52.923 --> 09:54.094
(sets stopper down)

09:54.094 --> 09:55.666
(pours liquor)

09:55.666 --> 09:58.899
AH. I SEE YOU'RE TAKING
YOUR COFFEE IRISH THIS MORNING.

09:58.899 --> 10:00.901
WHAT DO YOU WANT, MATHIS?

10:00.901 --> 10:02.733
I WANT ANOTHER BITE
AT THE APPLE.

10:02.733 --> 10:04.705
BACK WHEN YOU BECAME C.E.O.,
YOU TOLD ME

10:04.705 --> 10:06.777
YOU'D KEEP ME IN MIND
IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT

10:06.777 --> 10:08.238
THAT A SEAT OPENED UP
ON YOUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

10:08.238 --> 10:10.040
NOW IT SEEMS THAT
THAT UNLIKELY EVENT

10:10.040 --> 10:12.713
IS YOUR FATHER'S PLAY
FOR THE GOVERNOR'S MANSION.

10:12.713 --> 10:14.044
YEAH, WELL,
I WOULDN'T COUNT ON

10:14.044 --> 10:15.986
THE SUCCESS
OF THAT CAMPAIGN.

10:15.986 --> 10:17.988
SUCCESSFUL OR NOT,

10:17.988 --> 10:19.720
THE FACT REMAINS THAT

10:19.720 --> 10:21.191
THERE'S NOW AN OPEN SEAT
 ON YOUR BOARD.

10:21.191 --> 10:22.953
AND YOU STILL WANT IT.

10:22.953 --> 10:24.294
I'D LIKE TO THINK
THAT I EARNED IT.

10:24.294 --> 10:25.996
IF YOU RECALL, I WAS THE ONE
THAT BROUGHT YOU NOLCORP.

10:25.996 --> 10:27.898
AND WITHOUT THAT DEAL,

10:27.898 --> 10:29.730
YOU MAY NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE
TO STEER THIS COMPANY

10:29.730 --> 10:31.662
BACK ON THE PATH
TOWARD PROFITABILITY.

10:31.662 --> 10:33.003
I THINK WE'VE MANAGED

10:33.003 --> 10:34.765
TO STAY ON THAT PATH
JUST FINE WITHOUT YOU.

10:34.765 --> 10:35.936
(pats arm)

10:35.936 --> 10:38.208
I ASSUME
YOU'RE REFERENCING STONEHAVEN.

10:38.208 --> 10:40.070
THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY
IN DISASTER RELIEF.

10:40.070 --> 10:42.142
AND IT WOULD APPEAR THAT
THAT DEAL

10:42.142 --> 10:44.114
IS WORKING OUT RATHER WELL
FOR BOTH OF US. (clears throat)

10:44.114 --> 10:45.976
AND HOW'S THAT?

10:45.976 --> 10:47.647
WELL, WHEN I LEARNED THAT
YOU'D MADE A PRIORITY

10:47.647 --> 10:48.949
OF ACQUIRING STONEHAVEN,

10:48.949 --> 10:50.951
I TOOK IT UPON MYSELF
TO DISSUADE YOUR COMPETITION

10:50.951 --> 10:52.753
FROM OUTBIDDING YOU.

10:52.753 --> 10:55.425
I'M SORRY.
YOU SPOKE TO PROSSER?

10:55.425 --> 10:58.188
YEAH, I EVEN FLEW MYSELF OUT
TO LOS ANGELES ON MY OWN DIME.

10:58.188 --> 11:00.660
FEEL FREE TO CALL HIM
TO CONFIRM.

11:00.660 --> 11:01.992
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

11:01.992 --> 11:04.895
IN ADVANCE
OF THIS OPPORTUNITY.

11:04.895 --> 11:06.897
LOOK, I DIDN'T WANT
TO APPEAR MEDDLING,

11:06.897 --> 11:08.899
ONLY TO BE READY
WHEN THE TIME WAS RIGHT.

11:08.899 --> 11:10.901
LOOK, WE MAKE
ONE HELL OF A TEAM.

11:10.901 --> 11:12.372
YOU DEAL ME BACK IN,
AND I SWEAR,

11:12.372 --> 11:14.204
THE SKY'S THE LIMIT.

11:17.077 --> 11:19.880
(seagull calling)

11:35.095 --> 11:36.767
(exhales)

11:37.928 --> 11:38.999
(door creaks)

11:40.270 --> 11:43.133
TERRIBLE THING THAT'S HAPPENED.

11:43.133 --> 11:44.835
THE NAME'S FLETCH.

11:44.835 --> 11:47.938
I'M INVESTIGATING
THE INCIDENT ON THE BOAT.

11:47.938 --> 11:49.309
YOU ARE?

11:49.309 --> 11:52.112
EMILY THORNE,
THE CHILD'S GODMOTHER.

11:52.112 --> 11:55.115
YOU LOOKING FOR SOMETHING?

11:55.115 --> 11:59.920
UH, I JUST CAME BY
TO GET JACK SOME CLOTHES.

11:59.920 --> 12:02.052
WHAT EXACTLY
ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?

12:02.052 --> 12:03.754
MRS. PORTER IS
AS YET UNACCOUNTED FOR,

12:03.754 --> 12:05.295
AS IS THE SHIP'S DINGHY.

12:05.295 --> 12:06.997
CAN YOU THINK OF ANY REASON

12:06.997 --> 12:09.129
WHY SHE MIGHT HAVE WANTED
TO DISAPPEAR?

12:09.129 --> 12:11.902
DISAPPEAR? NO, NO.

12:11.902 --> 12:16.006
UM... AMANDA WAS HAPPIER
THAN SHE'S EVER BEEN.

12:16.006 --> 12:19.009
YOU'LL HAVE TO FORGIVE ME.
I GET PAID TO BE SUSPICIOUS.

12:19.009 --> 12:21.171
(cell phone rings and beeps)

12:21.171 --> 12:23.043
YEAH.

12:23.043 --> 12:26.516
I SEE. LET ME KNOW
WHEN YOU HAVE A POSITIVE I.D.

12:26.516 --> 12:28.318
(beep)

12:28.318 --> 12:30.050
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?

12:30.050 --> 12:32.052
I'M SORRY TO TELL YOU,
MS. THORNE,

12:32.052 --> 12:34.084
THE COAST GUARD
JUST IDENTIFIED ANOTHER VICTIM,

12:34.084 --> 12:36.086
FEMALE THIS TIME.

12:36.086 --> 12:37.757
AMANDA'S FAMILY
IS ON THEIR WAY OVER

12:37.757 --> 12:39.229
TO IDENTIFY THE BODY NOW.

12:39.229 --> 12:41.091
WHAT FAMILY?

12:41.091 --> 12:42.132
HER SISTER.

12:44.534 --> 12:48.038
DID YOU KILL AMANDA CLARKE?

12:49.900 --> 12:52.072
GOOD MORNING TO YOU, TOO,
MS. DAVENPORT.

12:52.072 --> 12:53.343
THAT'S WHY YOU CHOSE YESTERDAY

12:53.343 --> 12:56.776
TO ANNOUNCE YOUR
GUBERNATORIAL RUN, ISN'T IT?

12:56.776 --> 12:58.849
YOU NEEDED AN AUDIENCE
FOR YOUR ALIBI.

12:58.849 --> 12:59.980
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

12:59.980 --> 13:01.812
HORRIFIC, SOME MIGHT SAY.
 (scribbling)

13:01.812 --> 13:03.083
I KNOW THAT YOU MET
WITH NATE RYAN

13:03.083 --> 13:04.784
WHILE JACK AND AMANDA
WERE GETTING MARRIED.

13:04.784 --> 13:07.417
I HAD TO TELL HIM
THE WATERFRONT DEAL WAS OFF.

13:07.417 --> 13:10.790
I HAD NO IDEA IT WOULD
RESULT IN ALL THIS CARNAGE.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.362
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

13:12.362 --> 13:15.265
OH, WELL, THEN BELIEVE
WHAT YOU MUST.

13:15.265 --> 13:17.297
AND WHILE YOU'RE BUSY
POINTING FINGERS,

13:17.297 --> 13:20.300
BEAR IN MIND THAT NOT ONLY
WERE YOU AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT

13:20.300 --> 13:23.803
IN ALL MY RECENT INTERACTIONS
WITH MR. RYAN AND MR. PORTER,

13:23.803 --> 13:27.107
YOU ARE ACTUALLY THE ARCHITECT
OF THE DEAL,

13:27.107 --> 13:28.408
NOT TO MENTION
A MATERIAL WITNESS

13:28.408 --> 13:30.911
TO AMANDA'S TREACHERY
AGAINST ME.

13:30.911 --> 13:32.843
I HAD NO ISSUE
WITH AMANDA.

13:32.843 --> 13:35.145
WHAT HAPPENED TO HER
IS A TRAGEDY.

13:35.145 --> 13:37.387
THAT'S A SENTIMENT I INTEND
TO ECHO AT THE PRESS CONFERENCE

13:37.387 --> 13:39.089
YOU'RE ABOUT TO ARRANGE,

13:39.089 --> 13:41.091
UNLESS OF COURSE
THIS IS YOUR ROUNDABOUT WAY

13:41.091 --> 13:44.995
OF TENDERING
YOUR RESIGNATION.

13:44.995 --> 13:47.858
AH. DIDN'T THINK SO.

13:47.858 --> 13:49.229
(folder thuds)

13:58.008 --> 13:59.339
(sniffs)

13:59.339 --> 14:01.041
HOW'S JACK?

14:01.041 --> 14:04.044
OH, THE DOCTORS SAY
HE COULD WAKE UP AT ANY TIME.

14:04.044 --> 14:05.045
YOU OKAY?

14:05.045 --> 14:07.047
NOT EXACTLY.

14:07.047 --> 14:09.379
(cell phone beeps)
 (Trask) Your deadline
 is imminent, Ms. Lahari.

14:09.379 --> 14:12.622
Fail to meet it,
 there will be consequences.

14:12.622 --> 14:14.254
OKAY, LOOK, DON'T PANIC.

14:14.254 --> 14:16.927
NOT UNTIL WE KNOW IF...

14:16.927 --> 14:19.930
WHAT THEY SENT YOU
TRULY BELONGS TO YOUR FATHER.

14:19.930 --> 14:22.092
WHEN WILL THAT BE?

14:22.092 --> 14:23.934
UH, LOOK,
I'LL INTERFACE IMMIGRATION

14:23.934 --> 14:26.036
AND CHECK
YOUR FATHER'S FINGERPRINT.

14:26.036 --> 14:28.068
I'M NOT HANDING OVER
THAT PROGRAM

14:28.068 --> 14:30.100
UNTIL WE KNOW
THAT YOUR FATHER IS ALIVE.

14:30.100 --> 14:32.943
(voice breaking)
I KNOW I BETRAYED YOU.

14:32.943 --> 14:36.076
BUT YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON
WHO CAN SAVE HIM.

14:36.076 --> 14:37.908
I'M RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

14:37.908 --> 14:41.912
(sighs) DID--DO YOU STILL
HAVE HELEN'S NUMBER?

14:41.912 --> 14:44.214
IT'S BEEN DISCONNECTED.
 WELL, GIVE IT TO ME ANYWAY.

14:44.214 --> 14:48.018
SHE PROBABLY MET THAT CREEPY
VOICE MAIL GUY SOMEWHERE.
 (buttons clicking)

14:48.018 --> 14:50.560
HER PHONE RECORDS MIGHT
TELL US WHERE SHE WAS LAST.

14:50.560 --> 14:52.963
YOU SHOULD GET BACK
TO NOLCORP.

14:52.963 --> 14:54.264
THEY MIGHT BE WATCHING.

14:54.264 --> 14:56.997
I'LL MEET YOU AT THE OFFICE,
OKAY?

15:05.405 --> 15:07.107
IS JACK OKAY?

15:07.107 --> 15:09.109
(Nolan) He's still unconscious.
Declan's with him.

15:09.109 --> 15:11.011
Emily, I think you were right.

15:11.011 --> 15:12.983
THE GRAYSONS
KILLED HELEN CROWLEY.

15:12.983 --> 15:14.344
WHAT DID YOU FIND OUT?

15:14.344 --> 15:16.346
WELL, THE LAST TWO PLACES
HER PHONE WAS USED

15:16.346 --> 15:17.687
WERE GRAYSON MANOR

15:17.687 --> 15:20.020
AND THEN THE STOWAWAY
THE NEXT DAY--

15:20.020 --> 15:22.352
A PLACE HELEN
HAD NO REASON TO BE.

15:22.352 --> 15:24.354
BUT VICTORIA DID.

15:24.354 --> 15:26.026
MY GOD,
SHE WAS FRAMING AMANDA

15:26.026 --> 15:28.528
SO THE INITIATIVE WOULD
GO AFTER HER AND NOT THEM.

15:28.528 --> 15:31.061
LIKE FATHER, LIKE DAUGHTER?

15:31.061 --> 15:33.003
HEY, ANY LUCK FINDING
THAT COMPUTER?

15:33.003 --> 15:34.334
NO. NO.

15:34.334 --> 15:36.166
BUT I DON'T THINK AMANDA
WOULD RISK HIDING IT

15:36.166 --> 15:38.368
anywhere near Carl or Jack.

15:38.368 --> 15:40.010
(sighs) I GOTTA GO.

15:40.010 --> 15:42.042
(cell phone beeps)

15:44.074 --> 15:46.977
(telephone ringing in distance)

15:49.349 --> 15:52.152
VICTORIA.

15:53.423 --> 15:55.025
EMILY.

15:55.025 --> 15:56.586
WHERE'S CHARLOTTE?

15:56.586 --> 15:59.359
SHE INSISTED ON
GOING IN THERE ALONE.

16:01.161 --> 16:04.434
SHE'S BRAVE...

16:04.434 --> 16:06.136
LIKE HER SISTER.

16:06.136 --> 16:08.138
WELL, THERE ARE MOMENTS
IN A PERSON'S LIFE

16:08.138 --> 16:09.439
THAT CHANGE YOU FOREVER.

16:09.439 --> 16:12.142
AND I FEAR

16:12.142 --> 16:14.344
THAT THIS IS ONE OF THEM
FOR CHARLOTTE.

16:14.344 --> 16:16.346
ESPECIALLY SINCE
SHE AND HER SISTER

16:16.346 --> 16:18.378
HAD GROWN SO ATTACHED.

16:18.378 --> 16:22.112
YOU TRY TO PROTECT
YOUR CHILDREN FROM ALL PAIN.

16:22.112 --> 16:23.313
BUT TO NOT BE ABLE TO STOP

16:23.313 --> 16:25.515
WHAT'S GOING ON
BEHIND THOSE STEEL DOORS...

16:25.515 --> 16:29.519
YOU MUST FEEL SO HELPLESS.

16:29.519 --> 16:31.591
(door opens)

16:31.591 --> 16:33.363
(Charlotte crying) MOM.

16:33.363 --> 16:35.195
OH, SWEETHEART.

16:35.195 --> 16:37.767
BABY, I'VE GOT YOU.
IT'S OKAY.

16:37.767 --> 16:40.530
I'M HERE. I'M HERE.

16:40.530 --> 16:44.074
(continues crying)

16:53.543 --> 16:55.315
(telephone ringing in distance)

16:55.315 --> 16:58.748
(groans) I KNOW YOU TECHNICALLY
HAVE FREE REIN OVER THIS PLACE,

16:58.748 --> 17:00.590
BUT BELIEVE ME
WHEN I TELL YOU,

17:00.590 --> 17:03.393
YOU DO NOT WANT TO MESS
WITH ME, NOT TODAY.

17:03.393 --> 17:07.057
I'M SORRY ABOUT JACK
AND AMANDA. I-I JUST HEARD.

17:07.057 --> 17:09.329
I KNOW YOU DIDN'T COME
ALL THE WAY ACROSS TOWN

17:09.329 --> 17:11.431
TO DELIVER
YOUR HALF-HEARTED CONDOLENCES.

17:11.431 --> 17:13.363
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

17:13.363 --> 17:15.464
YOU NEVER SENT ME THE REPORT
I ASKED FOR

17:15.464 --> 17:17.307
DETAILING
YOUR ABANDONED R&D.

17:17.307 --> 17:20.240
YEAH. GUESS I
KIND OF FORGOT ABOUT IT.

17:20.240 --> 17:21.540
NO, SEE,
I DON'T THINK YOU DID.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.343
I THINK YOU DON'T WANT ME
TO KNOW ABOUT CARRION,

17:23.343 --> 17:26.316
AND YOU'D RATHER GET FIRED
THAN TELL ME WHAT IT DOES.

17:26.316 --> 17:29.449
LET'S SEE IF YOU'RE RIGHT.
FIRE ME.

17:29.449 --> 17:31.421
(lowered voice) NOLAN,

17:31.421 --> 17:33.083
IF I FIND OUT
YOU'VE DONE ANYTHING

17:33.083 --> 17:35.485
OTHER THAN DESTROY THAT PROGRAM,
I WON'T JUST FIRE YOU.

17:35.485 --> 17:37.387
I WILL CRIPPLE YOU
WITH LAWSUITS

17:37.387 --> 17:40.560
AND MAKE SURE YOU NEVER WRITE
ANOTHER LINE OF CODE AGAIN.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.262
YOU GOT IT?

17:42.262 --> 17:46.136
CONTROL, ALT, DELETE.

17:46.136 --> 17:47.697
GOT IT.

17:57.447 --> 17:59.309
SWEETHEART,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

18:01.411 --> 18:03.383
HOW'S LITTLE CARL?

18:03.383 --> 18:06.356
PERFECT.

18:06.356 --> 18:08.358
I KEEP CHECKING TO SEE
IF SOMETHING'S CHANGED,

18:08.358 --> 18:11.421
IF SOMEHOW HE KNOWS
HIS MOTHER'S... GONE, BUT--

18:11.421 --> 18:12.792
HE'S TOO LITTLE.

18:12.792 --> 18:15.325
HE COULDN'T POSSIBLY
UNDERSTAND.

18:15.325 --> 18:17.197
HE WILL ONE DAY.

18:18.868 --> 18:21.201
DO YOU REMEMBER
GRANDMA GRAYSON'S FUNERAL?

18:21.201 --> 18:23.233
MM-HMM.

18:23.233 --> 18:24.334
UNTIL TODAY,

18:24.334 --> 18:26.306
SHE WAS THE ONLY DEAD BODY
I'D EVER SEEN.

18:26.306 --> 18:29.239
AND SHE WAS SO BEAUTIFUL.

18:29.239 --> 18:31.481
BUT SEEING AMANDA
LYING THERE,

18:31.481 --> 18:32.812
I WANTED TO JUST SAY
IT WASN'T HER

18:32.812 --> 18:34.644
SO I COULD PRETEND
IT WASN'T TRUE.

18:34.644 --> 18:37.317
SHE HAD A VERY HARD LIFE.

18:37.317 --> 18:40.350
NOT EVERYBODY'S AS LUCKY
AS WE ARE.

18:40.350 --> 18:42.152
THE OTHER THING I REMEMBER

18:42.152 --> 18:43.823
ABOUT
GRANDMA GRAYSON'S FUNERAL...

18:43.823 --> 18:45.325
(sniffles)
WERE THE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE

18:45.325 --> 18:47.327
WHO CAME
TO PAY THEIR RESPECTS.

18:47.327 --> 18:49.359
I CAN'T FIND ANYONE
OUTSIDE OF MONTAUK

18:49.359 --> 18:51.561
TO INVITE
TO AMANDA'S SERVICE.

18:51.561 --> 18:53.303
HER MOM SEEMS TO HAVE JUST...

18:53.303 --> 18:56.506
DISAPPEARED INTO THIN AIR,
AND WHEN I CALLED THE STATE

18:56.506 --> 18:58.868
TO SEE IF THEY COULD HELP ME
FIND HER FOSTER FAMILY,

18:58.868 --> 19:01.241
THEY SAID I NEEDED A COURT ORDER
TO RELEASE THE RECORDS.

19:01.241 --> 19:03.173
WELL,
MAYBE IT'S FOR THE BEST.

19:03.173 --> 19:06.446
AMANDA LEFT THAT LIFE BEHIND
WHEN SHE CAME TO TOWN,

19:06.446 --> 19:07.747
AND I FEAR THAT IF YOU
GO DOWN THAT ROAD,

19:07.747 --> 19:09.419
YOU'LL FIND NOTHING
BUT PAIN.

19:09.419 --> 19:11.451
(cell phone chimes)

19:13.283 --> 19:15.154
OH, DARLING,
IT'S YOUR BROTHER.

19:16.426 --> 19:17.857

19:24.764 --> 19:27.197

HOW CAN I HELP?

19:43.553 --> 19:45.255
I'VE RETRACED EVERY STEP
AMANDA MADE.

19:45.255 --> 19:46.556
THE COMPUTER'S NOWHERE
TO BE FOUND.

19:46.556 --> 19:48.658
WELL, NOTHING'S PINGED
ON MY END,

19:48.658 --> 19:50.290
SO NO ONE'S TURNED
THE COMPUTER ON,

19:50.290 --> 19:52.692
WHICH MEANS THE GRAYSONS
DON'T HAVE IT EITHER.

19:52.692 --> 19:55.565
AND THEY
MAY BE LOSING DANIEL, TOO.

19:55.565 --> 19:57.267
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

19:57.267 --> 19:58.868
Well, he came over here
in person

19:58.868 --> 20:00.400
TO TELL ME TO DESTROY CARRION.

20:00.400 --> 20:01.831
THREATENED TO BREAK
MY DIGITAL KNEECAPS

20:01.831 --> 20:03.473

20:03.473 --> 20:05.235
HE'S HAVING A CRISIS
OF CONSCIENCE.

20:05.235 --> 20:06.406
Or maybe

20:06.406 --> 20:07.377
HE'S JUST FREAKED OUT

20:07.377 --> 20:09.379
TO REALIZE
HE'S ACTUALLY GOT ONE.

20:09.379 --> 20:12.742
PROBLEM IS,
MINE'S SENDING UP RED FLAGS.

20:12.742 --> 20:14.414
Because of Padma's father.

20:14.414 --> 20:16.616
LIKE I SAID, I'M LIFE'S PAWN.
 (beeping)

20:16.616 --> 20:19.389
I JUST HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
WHO'S MOVING ME NEXT.

20:19.389 --> 20:20.550
(door opens)

20:20.550 --> 20:22.252
Any word on Jack?

20:22.252 --> 20:25.395
UH, NO, NOT YET.
I WAS ABOUT TO HEAD OVER.

20:25.395 --> 20:27.927

I'LL MEET YOU THERE.

20:31.801 --> 20:32.962

20:32.962 --> 20:35.465
I HEARD THEY FOUND AMANDA.

20:35.465 --> 20:37.767
CHARLOTTE MADE THE I.D.

20:37.767 --> 20:39.569
IS SHE ALL RIGHT?

20:39.569 --> 20:41.771
NO.

20:41.771 --> 20:44.574
NO, SHE'S NOT.

20:44.574 --> 20:47.347
AND WHAT'S WORSE...

20:47.347 --> 20:48.978
IS VICTORIA IS USING
AMANDA'S DEATH

20:48.978 --> 20:52.422
TO GET CLOSE
TO CHARLOTTE AGAIN.

20:52.422 --> 20:55.825
WITHOUT THAT LOVE...
VICTORIA WOULD HAVE NOTHING.

20:55.825 --> 20:58.828
WELL, YOU'VE ALWAYS KNOWN
HOW TO DESTROY THE WOMAN.

20:58.828 --> 21:01.861

21:11.771 --> 21:14.474

I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

21:16.005 --> 21:17.447

21:17.447 --> 21:19.008
JACK'S COMING TO.

21:19.008 --> 21:21.411

22:23.613 --> 22:27.617

22:27.617 --> 22:30.480

22:36.556 --> 22:37.857
APOLOGIES, JACK.

22:37.857 --> 22:39.489
I ASSURE YOU,
IT WASN'T MY INTENT

22:39.489 --> 22:42.662
TO, UH, INTERRUPT YOU
IN YOUR HOUR OF GRIEF.

22:42.662 --> 22:45.094
YOU CAN STOP PRETENDING.
I KNOW WHY YOU'RE REALLY HERE.

22:45.094 --> 22:47.467
(monitor beeping steadily)

22:47.467 --> 22:48.968
THE ADMINISTRATOR
JUST TOLD ME

22:48.968 --> 22:50.640
YOU OFFERED TO PAY
MY HOSPITAL BILL.

22:50.640 --> 22:52.371
(telephone ringing in distance)

22:52.371 --> 22:54.404
WELL,
YOU'VE BEEN MISINFORMED.

22:54.404 --> 22:56.676
I DIDN'T OFFER.
I INSISTED.

22:56.676 --> 22:59.949
ONE OF THE LAST THINGS YOU NEED
TO BE GRAPPLING WITH RIGHT NOW

22:59.949 --> 23:01.951
IS A STEEP FINANCIAL BLOW.

23:01.951 --> 23:03.453
YOU'RE VERY GENEROUS.

23:03.453 --> 23:05.455
(chuckles)
TRAGEDY HAS A WAY

23:05.455 --> 23:07.757
OF BRINGING OUT
OUR BETTER ANGELS.

23:09.158 --> 23:11.390
AND, UH, YOU KNOW, IN SPITE
OF OUR STRAINED HISTORY,

23:11.390 --> 23:13.693

23:13.693 --> 23:15.425

23:15.425 --> 23:16.966
AS ARE YOU AND YOUR SON.

23:16.966 --> 23:19.168
LISTEN, I TAKE IT
AS A PERSONAL FAILURE

23:19.168 --> 23:22.401
THAT I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE
NATE RYAN WAS USING ME

23:22.401 --> 23:23.903
TO INJURE YOU.

23:23.903 --> 23:26.175
WELL, YOU DID THE RIGHT THING
IN THE END.

23:26.175 --> 23:27.877
(beeping continues)

23:27.877 --> 23:31.040

LOOK HIM IN THE EYE...

23:31.040 --> 23:33.883
AND ASK WHY?

23:33.883 --> 23:35.645
(voice breaks)
WHY DID AMANDA HAVE TO PAY

23:35.645 --> 23:37.116
FOR THE SINS OF MY FATHER?

23:40.620 --> 23:42.852
SON...

23:42.852 --> 23:44.153
JUST CHERISH
THE BEAUTIFUL MEMORIES

23:44.153 --> 23:46.496
YOU HAVE OF YOUR WIFE

23:46.496 --> 23:50.199

FOR BABY CARL.

24:08.618 --> 24:10.119

24:10.119 --> 24:11.981
WE'RE EVER GONNA KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED

24:11.981 --> 24:13.152

24:13.152 --> 24:14.784

I'M GONNA NEED
SOME SIGNATURES FROM YOU.

24:26.666 --> 24:29.098
TOO LATE FOR WHAT? WHAT--
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

24:29.098 --> 24:31.100
THE REAL REASON AMANDA
CAME BACK TO THE HAMPTONS

24:31.100 --> 24:32.802
IS THE GRAYSONS
FRAMED HER FATHER.

24:32.802 --> 24:34.103
EVERYTHING SHE NEEDS
TO EXPOSE THEM

24:34.103 --> 24:36.005
IS ON SOME COMPUTER
SHE STOLE FROM CONRAD.

24:36.005 --> 24:37.176
THAT'S WHY THEY MURDERED HER.

24:37.176 --> 24:38.648
I GOTTA FIND IT
BEFORE GRAYSON DOES.

24:38.648 --> 24:39.779
JUST TELL US WHERE IT IS
AND WE'LL FIND IT FOR YOU.

24:39.779 --> 24:41.681
I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT IS.
THAT'S THE THING.

24:41.681 --> 24:43.953
LOOK, YOU CA--YOU CAN'T TELL
ANYONE ABOUT THIS,

24:43.953 --> 24:45.114
ESPECIALLY THE POLICE.

24:45.114 --> 24:47.116
WE WON'T,
BUT YOU ARE MUCH SAFER HERE,

24:47.116 --> 24:49.018
ESPECIALLY IF WHAT YOU SAY
IS TRUE.

24:49.018 --> 24:50.189
IF YOU DON'T HELP ME
GET OUT OF HERE,

24:50.189 --> 24:51.791
I WILL WALK OUT MYSELF.

24:51.791 --> 24:52.822
OKAY, LISTEN, WE WILL ARRANGE
FOR HELP AT THE STOWAWAY,

24:52.822 --> 24:54.163

24:59.569 --> 25:01.070

25:01.070 --> 25:04.203
I'VE BEEN LOOKING INTO
THE CRASH OF FLIGHT 197.

25:04.203 --> 25:06.205
WHAT EXACTLY FOR?

25:06.205 --> 25:09.178

IN THE WAKE OF THE ATTACK.

25:17.847 --> 25:20.690

WHAT NIGHTMARE
THEY'RE PLANNING FOR US NEXT,

25:23.152 --> 25:24.824

CUT THEM OUT 20 YEARS AGO?

25:33.132 --> 25:35.134

25:35.134 --> 25:37.637

(crying)

28:48.297 --> 28:49.458
(sniffles)

28:59.208 --> 29:01.040
CHARLOTTE?

29:01.040 --> 29:02.141
SHH.

29:02.141 --> 29:05.274
(lowered voice) OH. SORRY.

29:05.274 --> 29:07.176
I JUST WANTED TO COME
AND--AND CHECK IN

29:07.176 --> 29:08.978
AND SEE HOW YOU WERE DOING.

29:08.978 --> 29:11.120
I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM YOU
IN A COUPLE OF DAYS.

29:11.120 --> 29:13.983
I GUESS I'M MORE PRIVATE
THAN THE REST OF MY FAMILY.

29:13.983 --> 29:15.284
MM.

29:15.284 --> 29:17.526
I HEARD YOUR DAD'S...

29:17.526 --> 29:19.829
MAKING A STATEMENT TODAY.

29:19.829 --> 29:22.031
I KNOW, OF ALL DAYS.

29:22.031 --> 29:23.292
MM.

29:23.292 --> 29:25.294
I FEEL LIKE I WAS
JUST GETTING TO KNOW HER.

29:25.294 --> 29:27.296
I STILL HAD SO MANY QUESTIONS.

29:27.296 --> 29:30.299
SHE HAD THIS WHOLE PAST
I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT.

29:30.299 --> 29:32.541
AND I HATE THAT THERE WILL
ONLY BE A FEW PEOPLE

29:32.541 --> 29:34.203
COMING TO HER FUNERAL.

29:34.203 --> 29:36.205
IT'S ALL THE PEOPLE
THAT MATTERED TO HER.

29:36.205 --> 29:38.177
THAT'S ALL THAT COUNTS.

29:38.177 --> 29:41.250
I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

29:41.250 --> 29:44.914
SHE JUST DESERVED
SUCH A FULLER LIFE.

29:46.986 --> 29:49.158
WELL, I JUST WANTED
TO CHECK IN.

29:49.158 --> 29:51.290
I'LL SEE YOU AT THE SERVICE.

29:51.290 --> 29:54.293
EMILY.

29:54.293 --> 29:57.196
SHE WAS LUCKY TO HAVE
A FRIEND LIKE YOU.

30:02.972 --> 30:05.074
(computer chimes)

30:08.437 --> 30:09.979
(typing)

30:09.979 --> 30:12.511
(chimes)

30:12.511 --> 30:13.983
(chimes)

30:15.444 --> 30:17.286
MATHIS, IT'S GRAYSON.

30:17.286 --> 30:20.019
MORNING.
I HOPE IT'S GOOD NEWS.

30:20.019 --> 30:21.150
Uh, you tell me.

30:21.150 --> 30:22.321
I'M PLANNING TO PRESENT YOU

30:22.321 --> 30:24.293
TO THE BOARD FOR VETTING
AT THE NEXT MEETING.

30:24.293 --> 30:26.125
THAT'S NOT GOOD NEWS.
THAT'S FANTASTIC NEWS.

30:26.125 --> 30:27.456
First I'd like

30:27.456 --> 30:28.998
TO SHOWCASE YOUR VALUE

30:28.998 --> 30:31.200
BY HAVING YOU CAPITALIZE
ON SOME OPPORTUNITIES ABROAD.

30:31.200 --> 30:32.531
HAPPY TO.

30:32.531 --> 30:34.964
ALL RIGHT. LET ME KNOW
WHEN YOU'VE MADE THE TRADES.

30:34.964 --> 30:36.305
(cell phone beeps)

30:36.305 --> 30:37.466
EMILY.

30:37.466 --> 30:39.238
DANIEL, HI.

30:39.238 --> 30:44.013
UM... I'VE BEEN MEANING
TO CALL OR STOP BY.

30:44.013 --> 30:46.245
OH, YOU'RE BUSY.
IT'S OKAY.

30:47.877 --> 30:52.051
I'M... SO SORRY...
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

30:52.051 --> 30:54.183
YEAH.

30:54.183 --> 30:56.585
DO YOU THINK YOU'LL BE
COMING TO THE FUNERAL?

30:56.585 --> 30:59.929
I KNOW IT'D MEAN
A LOT TO CHARLOTTE AND...

30:59.929 --> 31:01.860
TO ME, TOO.

31:01.860 --> 31:03.532
YEAH. I'LL BE THERE.

31:03.532 --> 31:05.434
GOOD.

31:05.434 --> 31:07.236
THANKS.

31:24.283 --> 31:26.215
(Conrad)
THE GREAT STATE OF NEW YORK

31:26.215 --> 31:29.158
IS BUILT ON THE STRENGTH
OF ITS COMMUNITY.

31:29.158 --> 31:32.291
THE HEART OF THE STATE
IS ITS POPULOUS.

31:32.291 --> 31:35.464
(camera shutters clicking)
 TO GOVERN IT ALL
IS TO GOVERN FOR ALL.

31:35.464 --> 31:38.527
SO WHEN ONE OF US IS LOST,

31:38.527 --> 31:42.331
IT ALTERS THE STATE,
THE CITY, THE CITIZEN.

31:42.331 --> 31:44.633
I INVITE YOU ALL TO JOIN ME
IN MOURNING THE LOSS

31:44.633 --> 31:46.335
OF AMANDA CLARKE,

31:46.335 --> 31:50.279
A LIFE SADLY CUT SHORT
DECADES BEFORE HER TIME.

31:50.279 --> 31:52.681
A VICTIM OF CIRCUMSTANCE,

31:52.681 --> 31:56.315
AMANDA LED
A TROUBLED EARLY LIFE

31:56.315 --> 31:59.448
BUT PERSEVERED
THROUGH MONUMENTAL ODDS

31:59.448 --> 32:02.191
AND CREATED A LOVING FAMILY
OF HER OWN.

32:02.191 --> 32:03.953
(computer beeps)

32:03.953 --> 32:05.524
SHE LEAVES BEHIND
HER LOVING HUSBAND JACK,

32:05.524 --> 32:07.656
HER YOUNG SON CARL...
 (beeps)

32:07.656 --> 32:10.529
AND HER HALF SISTER,
MY DAUGHTER CHARLOTTE.

32:10.529 --> 32:13.062
AND AS MY FAMILY MOURNS
HER LOSS,

32:13.062 --> 32:15.634
WE CHERISH HER MEMORY.

32:15.634 --> 32:18.637
HEY, NOLAN. YOU WATCHING THIS?
 (Conrad) GRIEF IS AN EMOTION
 WE ALL HAVE IN COMMON...

32:18.637 --> 32:20.309
SOMEONE TURNED ON YOUR COMPUTER.

32:20.309 --> 32:22.311
TELL ME IT'S NOT
AT GRAYSON MANOR.

32:22.311 --> 32:24.313
WORSE.
 (Conrad) ...TODAY TO SHARE
 THIS HEAVY BURDEN...

32:24.313 --> 32:26.115
IT'S AT THE STOWAWAY.

32:26.115 --> 32:29.278
AS NEW YORKERS,
 AS HUMAN BEINGS,

32:29.278 --> 32:32.651
AND, OF COURSE, AS PORTERS.

32:32.651 --> 32:35.584
(camera shutters clicking)
 JACK...

32:35.584 --> 32:37.526
MY CONDOLENCES.

32:37.526 --> 32:40.529
THANK YOU FOR
 YOUR KIND WORDS, MR. GRAYSON.

32:40.529 --> 32:42.191
I'M SURE WHEREVER
AMANDA IS RIGHT NOW,

32:42.191 --> 32:44.163
SHE'S WATCHING...
 (man) MR. GRAYSON?

32:44.163 --> 32:47.166
ARE YOU GOING TO--
GOING TO HAVE...
 AND SMILING.

32:47.166 --> 32:50.069
(applause)

32:50.069 --> 32:57.476
NO, JACK.

32:58.277 --> 32:59.378
(knock on door)

32:59.378 --> 33:01.550
HEY.

33:01.550 --> 33:03.212
(sighs)

33:03.212 --> 33:05.584
I SAW YOU ON TV.
I'M SURE IT WASN'T EASY

33:05.584 --> 33:08.017
WATCHING CONRAD
CAPITALIZE ON ALL THIS.

33:09.588 --> 33:11.090
HERE. LET ME HELP YOU.

33:14.363 --> 33:15.664
THANK YOU.

33:15.664 --> 33:18.697
I REMEMBER WHEN AMANDA
FIRST MOVED IN HERE.

33:18.697 --> 33:20.699
(fabric rustling)

33:20.699 --> 33:23.532
SHE SAID IT WAS THE FIRST PLACE
THAT EVER FELT LIKE HOME.

33:23.532 --> 33:26.135
EXCEPT FOR
HER FATHER'S COTTAGE,

33:26.135 --> 33:28.677
WHICH...
NOW BELONGS TO YOU.

33:30.409 --> 33:34.213
YOU GONNA PUT THAT
IN YOUR EULOGY?

33:34.213 --> 33:35.644
NO.

33:37.146 --> 33:40.549
WHAT ABOUT YOUR TIME
TOGETHER IN JUVIE?

33:40.549 --> 33:42.391
I ALWAYS WONDERED

33:42.391 --> 33:45.724
HOW YOU GOT SO CLOSE
SO FAST.

33:45.724 --> 33:47.796
DID SHE PICK YOU UP FROM
ALLENWOOD LIKE SHE PROMISED?

33:47.796 --> 33:50.459
IT WAS IN THE DUFFEL BAG WITH
THE COMPUTER SHE WAS HIDING,

33:50.459 --> 33:52.601
OR YOU WERE BOTH HIDING
AS FAR AS I KNOW.

33:52.601 --> 33:53.562
JACK--

33:53.562 --> 33:55.104
ON TOP OF ALL THE MISERY,

33:55.104 --> 33:56.765
TO FIND OUT THAT YOU
WERE LYING TO ME, TOO?

33:56.765 --> 33:59.238
YOU DIDN'T JUST KNOW EACH OTHER.
YOU WERE LIKE SISTERS.

33:59.238 --> 34:00.409
IT WAS A PART OF MY PAST

34:00.409 --> 34:01.670
I DIDN'T WANT ANYONE
TO KNOW ABOUT.

34:01.670 --> 34:03.612
WHY? DIDN'T WANT TO TARNISH
YOUR PERFECT IMAGE?

34:03.612 --> 34:05.314
(sighs) THE SAME REASON
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME

34:05.314 --> 34:07.246
WHAT WAS HAPPENING
WITH THE RYAN BROTHERS--

34:07.246 --> 34:09.478
PRIDE,
SELF-PRESERVATION.

34:09.478 --> 34:13.252
WHAT ELSE DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
OUT OF SELF-PRESERVATION?

34:13.252 --> 34:17.085
THAT AMANDA LOVED YOU FROM
THE MOMENT THAT SHE MET YOU.

34:17.085 --> 34:19.128
AND NONE OF THAT
EVER STOPPED,

34:19.128 --> 34:21.460
NOT IN THE FOSTER HOMES,
NOT IN JUVIE.

34:21.460 --> 34:23.492
NONE OF THAT WAS A LIE.

34:23.492 --> 34:26.335
DID YOU KNOW ABOUT HER PLAN
FOR THE GRAYSONS?

34:26.335 --> 34:27.735
JACK, THIS WAS SO--

34:27.735 --> 34:31.469
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT, EMILY.

34:31.469 --> 34:33.342
YOU'RE CARL'S GODMOTHER.
IF YOU KNEW,

34:33.342 --> 34:35.444
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU WOULD LET
AMANDA PUT HERSELF,

34:35.444 --> 34:37.275
ALL OF US,
IN THAT KIND OF DANGER.

34:37.275 --> 34:39.277
JACK, I AM SO SORRY
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

34:39.277 --> 34:40.748
I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR THIS.

34:40.748 --> 34:44.183
I GOTTA BURY MY WIFE
IN AN HOUR.

34:47.656 --> 34:49.558
PLEASE...

34:49.558 --> 34:51.420
JUST GO.

35:04.333 --> 35:05.734
(telephone ringing in distance)

35:05.734 --> 35:07.876
SHOULDN'T YOU BE
AT THE FUNERAL?

35:07.876 --> 35:11.210
I'M LEAVING
IN A FEW MINUTES.

35:11.210 --> 35:13.812
I'VE BEEN UP...

35:13.812 --> 35:15.414
ALL NIGHT

35:15.414 --> 35:17.486
WORKING ON CARRION,

35:17.486 --> 35:19.548
FINISHING IT.

35:21.820 --> 35:23.822
THE FINGERPRINT
MATCHED YOUR FATHER'S

35:23.822 --> 35:25.424
IMMIGRATION FILE.

35:25.424 --> 35:27.526
ONE FUNERAL'S ENOUGH
FOR TODAY.

35:27.526 --> 35:29.528
I JUST HOPE THERE AREN'T
COUNTLESS MORE

35:29.528 --> 35:31.700
COMING DOWN THE PIKE.

35:39.638 --> 35:41.540
I CAN'T TELL YOU
WHAT TO DO, PADMA.

35:41.540 --> 35:43.742
BUT WHEN THEY MAKE CONTACT,

35:43.742 --> 35:46.144
KEEP IN MIND

35:46.144 --> 35:47.776
THAT THE PEOPLE
THAT TOOK YOUR DAD

35:47.776 --> 35:49.648
DON'T HAVE
THE BEST TRACK RECORD

35:49.648 --> 35:52.521
WHEN IT COMES TO FULFILLING
THEIR END OF THE BARGAIN.

35:56.285 --> 35:59.258
(Emily) DEATH IS A THIEF.

35:59.258 --> 36:03.292
IT TAKES AND KEEPS
ALL THAT A PERSON IS...

36:03.292 --> 36:05.594
THAT A PERSON WAS.

36:07.436 --> 36:09.268
AND WHEN DEATH TAKES FROM US

36:09.268 --> 36:11.940
SOMEONE AS EXTRAORDINARY
AS AMANDA,

36:11.940 --> 36:15.574
IT TAKES WITH IT
NOT JUST HER PAST,

36:15.574 --> 36:18.447
BUT WHO SHE WAS TO US EVERY DAY.

36:18.447 --> 36:20.779
AMANDA WAS SPECIAL.

36:20.779 --> 36:23.952
BUT SHE NEVER HAD IT EASY.

36:23.952 --> 36:27.316
A CHILDHOOD TORN FROM HER...

36:27.316 --> 36:29.588
(crow cawing)

36:29.588 --> 36:31.620
A ROUGH ADOLESCENCE,

36:31.620 --> 36:33.792
AND A DAMNING IDENTITY
THAT WAS THRUST UPON HER,

36:33.792 --> 36:37.426
WHICH SHE BORE WITH DIGNITY

36:37.426 --> 36:40.699
UNTIL SHE MADE HERSELF
A NEW NAME--

36:40.699 --> 36:42.531
AMANDA PORTER...

36:42.531 --> 36:45.434
(whispers) WE CAN TRUST AIDEN.
HE MADE THE TRADES.

36:45.434 --> 36:48.637
A NAME THAT WAS HER OWN,

36:48.637 --> 36:52.711
FREE FROM THE BINDS
OF HISTORY...

36:52.711 --> 36:53.942
(lock turns)

36:53.942 --> 36:57.546
LOOKING FORWARD WITH A MAN
WHO LOVED HER FOR...

36:57.546 --> 37:00.619
ALL OF HER STRENGTHS...

37:00.619 --> 37:02.891
AND ALL OF HER WEAKNESSES.

37:05.223 --> 37:07.225
AMANDA, ALL OF US HERE TODAY
HAVE EMBRACED YOU,

37:07.225 --> 37:08.797
AND WE LOVE YOU.

37:08.797 --> 37:10.999
WE WILL PROTECT...

37:10.999 --> 37:15.864
THE HUSBAND AND CHILD
THAT YOU LEAVE BEHIND,

37:15.864 --> 37:19.568
THE SISTER THAT YOU WERE
JUST GETTING TO KNOW.

37:19.568 --> 37:23.642
AND WE WILL GREET
EVERY NEW DAY AS A GIFT,

37:23.642 --> 37:26.815
APPROACHING IT
WITH THE SAME BRAVERY

37:26.815 --> 37:28.847
AND DETERMINATION

37:28.847 --> 37:32.621
WITH WHICH YOU LIVED
YOUR ENTIRE LIFE.

38:15.564 --> 38:18.397
THANK YOU FOR COMING,

38:18.397 --> 38:20.329
YOUR WHOLE FAMILY.
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

38:20.329 --> 38:22.771
WELL, WE ALL WANTED TO,
SON.

38:22.771 --> 38:24.703
I WAS, UH,
HOPING I COULD COME BY

38:24.703 --> 38:26.605
AND VISIT YOU NEXT WEEK.

38:26.605 --> 38:30.479
MAYBE TALK ABOUT FINDING A WAY
TO HONOR AMANDA.

38:30.479 --> 38:32.681
OUR DOOR IS ALWAYS OPEN.

38:32.681 --> 38:34.683
ALWAYS.

38:34.683 --> 38:36.745
I'M SORRY.

38:36.745 --> 38:39.087
I DON'T KNOW
IF HE'LL EVER FORGIVE ME.

38:39.087 --> 38:40.619
HE'LL COME AROUND.

38:40.619 --> 38:42.050
I WANTED TO TELL HIM
THE TRUTH.

38:42.050 --> 38:43.722
HE DESERVES THAT.

38:43.722 --> 38:45.554
SOMEDAY,

38:45.554 --> 38:47.626
MAYBE.

38:47.626 --> 38:49.498
RIGHT NOW,
REGARDLESS OF HOW HE FEELS,

38:49.498 --> 38:53.632
YOU CAN'T TAKE AMANDA
AWAY FROM HIM AGAIN.

38:54.833 --> 38:57.005
NOLAN. (sniffles)

38:57.005 --> 38:58.807
YOU THINK YOU CAN COME BACK
TO THE BAR WITH ME?

39:00.108 --> 39:03.071
I GOT SOME COMPUTER PROBLEMS
I NEED YOUR HELP WITH.

39:03.071 --> 39:04.443
OF COURSE.

39:08.477 --> 39:09.618
(cell phone rings)

39:09.618 --> 39:10.779
(beep)

39:10.779 --> 39:12.350
YES.

39:12.350 --> 39:14.583
THE BOY KNOWS NOTHING.

39:19.788 --> 39:23.592
IT WAS A LOVELY SPEECH.

39:23.592 --> 39:25.664
UNFORTUNATELY,

39:25.664 --> 39:28.697
DESPITE THEIR BEST EFFORTS,

39:28.697 --> 39:31.700
DAVID AND HIS DAUGHTER
WERE PLAGUED BY DARKNESS.

39:34.372 --> 39:38.807
AT LEAST HE WASN'T HERE
TO SEE HER GO.

39:38.807 --> 39:41.680
TO LOSE A CHILD LIKE THAT...

39:43.512 --> 39:48.417
NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO BEAR
THAT KIND OF LOSS.

40:16.715 --> 40:18.787
GRAYSON.

40:18.787 --> 40:21.790
(wind blowing loudly)

40:25.594 --> 40:27.496
BACK IN YOUR HANDS
WHERE IT BELONGS,

40:27.496 --> 40:30.529
FOR YOU TO DO WITH
AS YOU WISH.

40:35.534 --> 40:36.735
(grunts)

40:36.735 --> 40:37.806
(computer splashes)

40:37.806 --> 40:39.137
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

40:40.939 --> 40:42.641
PROTECTING JACK
LIKE I SAID I WOULD.

40:42.641 --> 40:43.872
THE EVIDENCE ON THAT LAPTOP

40:43.872 --> 40:45.143
COULD SEND THE GRAYSONS
AWAY FOR LIFETIMES.

40:45.143 --> 40:46.775
THE KIND OF PUNISHMENT
I CAME HERE FOR

40:46.775 --> 40:49.047
HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH PRISON.

40:49.047 --> 40:51.049
THAT COMPUTER WAS NEVER
PART OF THE PLAN.

40:51.049 --> 40:53.982
IT ONLY CLOUDED MY JUDGMENT.

40:53.982 --> 40:56.525
SO BACK TO BASICS?

40:57.556 --> 41:00.088
NO MORE DISTRACTIONS.

41:02.791 --> 41:05.794
(siren wailing in distance)

41:09.167 --> 41:11.139
(glass clatters,
horn honks in distance)

41:11.139 --> 41:14.603
(clock ticking)

41:16.975 --> 41:20.008
GRACE, CAN YOU COME HERE?

41:20.008 --> 41:21.710
WHAT TIME HAVE YOU GOT?

41:21.710 --> 41:23.181
UH, 7:40, WHY?

41:23.181 --> 41:24.783
THIS CLOCK'S RUNNING SLOW.

41:24.783 --> 41:26.655
YOU MIND TAKING IT
 TO THE SHOP?

41:26.655 --> 41:28.887
NO PROBLEM.

41:30.519 --> 41:32.621
IF YOU LIKE IT,
YOU CAN KEEP IT.

41:32.621 --> 41:34.893
MY WATCH WORKS JUST FINE.

41:49.578 --> 41:52.581
(thunder rumbling)

41:57.846 --> 41:59.948
(man) DID YOU KNOW HER WELL?

42:02.691 --> 42:05.023
VERY.

42:05.023 --> 42:08.526
THE AMANDA CLARKE I KNEW
WAS A SURVIVOR.

42:08.526 --> 42:11.560
NEVER THOUGHT
I'D FIND HER HERE.

42:12.831 --> 42:14.763
HOW DID YOU KNOW HER?

42:14.763 --> 42:17.566
SHE BURNED OUR HOUSE DOWN.

42:20.208 --> 42:22.611
WHO ARE YOU?

42:22.611 --> 42:24.813
I'M HER BROTHER.
