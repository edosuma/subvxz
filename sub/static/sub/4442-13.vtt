00:33.103 --> 00:35.238
Hey.

00:35.306 --> 00:36.939
How was the hotel?

00:37.007 --> 00:38.508
Good.

00:38.576 --> 00:40.042
The house looks good.

00:40.110 --> 00:41.077
Can't believe
it only took them a week

00:41.144 --> 00:42.184
to repair the fire damage.

00:42.246 --> 00:43.680
Listen, there's something...

00:43.747 --> 00:45.881
that we have to talk about.

00:45.949 --> 00:48.084
I have been through

00:48.151 --> 00:51.287
a range of emotions
this past week.

00:51.355 --> 00:55.291
First I was shocked,
and then I was jealous.

00:55.359 --> 00:57.126
Look, I...
I...

00:57.194 --> 00:59.562
am the man of the house.

00:59.630 --> 01:02.932
I'm the one who should've
saved Wilfred from that fire,

01:02.999 --> 01:05.367
but instead, I just vag'd out.

01:05.436 --> 01:09.105
I mean, thank God you
were there, obviously,

01:09.172 --> 01:13.943
but I am so embarrassed and...
mad at myself.

01:14.010 --> 01:17.647
Come on. Don't-don't
beat yourself up.

01:17.715 --> 01:19.915
It was the middle of the night.
You were confused.

01:19.983 --> 01:21.150
You were breathing in smoke.

01:21.218 --> 01:23.185
If I had waited two seconds,

01:23.254 --> 01:24.987
I'm sure you would've
sprinted in there.

01:26.390 --> 01:28.258
Ah.

01:28.325 --> 01:31.494
Thanks for the devagification.

01:33.330 --> 01:34.631
You're a good friend, Ryan.

01:41.071 --> 01:42.805
Looks like somebody's happy
to see you.

01:48.746 --> 01:51.247
Welcome back.
Thanks.

01:51.315 --> 01:52.948
What's wrong?

01:53.016 --> 01:54.950
Nothing.

01:55.018 --> 01:57.353
Okay, you're obviously
pissed off about something.

01:57.421 --> 01:59.021
Jenna's having an affair, Ryan.

01:59.089 --> 02:01.824
(sighs) Look at her,

02:01.892 --> 02:04.260
acting all innocent,
like she isn't cheating on Drew

02:04.328 --> 02:06.629
with some tramp, probably
sharing plates of spaghetti

02:06.697 --> 02:08.464
that are actually
just one long noodle.

02:08.532 --> 02:09.666
Hey.

02:09.733 --> 02:11.701
Uh, we should talk.

02:11.769 --> 02:14.570
Actually, I was just gonna
take Wilfred to the dog park.

02:14.638 --> 02:16.272
But...
It's the least I can do.

02:16.340 --> 02:18.107
A-And the dog park
closes at sunset.

02:18.175 --> 02:19.642
W-We'll catch
up soon, yeah?

02:19.710 --> 02:21.778
Cockaholic!

02:21.845 --> 02:25.214
A day or so after the fire,
I smelled something on her,

02:25.282 --> 02:28.818
a scent I didn't recognize,
a masculine perfumeyness.

02:28.885 --> 02:30.453
Weird.

02:30.521 --> 02:32.555
Plus, her pheromones have
been exploding all week.

02:32.623 --> 02:34.724
She is swampy for
this home-wrecker.

02:34.792 --> 02:37.059
At first I thought it was you.
(scoffs)

02:37.127 --> 02:39.796
But then I thought about what
you look like and act like

02:39.863 --> 02:41.698
and how you struggle
with dandruff and stuff,

02:41.765 --> 02:43.533
and, honestly, I just
burst out laughing.

02:43.600 --> 02:45.034
(chuckles)

02:45.101 --> 02:46.803
Most importantly,
you know my policy.

02:46.870 --> 02:48.771
If anything happened
between you and Jenna,

02:48.839 --> 02:51.073
I'd be forced to
bite your genitals.

02:51.141 --> 02:53.409
And by bite, you know I mean
that thing where I kind of

02:53.477 --> 02:56.011
latch on and shake my head
back and forth super fast.

02:56.079 --> 02:57.814
You know that thing?
Yeah. I-I got it.

02:57.881 --> 02:59.382
(knocking)

03:00.951 --> 03:02.652
Uh...

03:02.720 --> 03:03.919
D-Do you want to come in?

03:03.987 --> 03:05.355
No, um, I'm-I'm actually

03:05.422 --> 03:06.956
not gonna stay that long.

03:08.892 --> 03:10.926
So, I-I've been thinking

03:10.994 --> 03:12.562
about what happened
between us, and...

03:14.565 --> 03:16.899
...it was a horrible mistake.

03:16.967 --> 03:19.101
So I think

03:19.169 --> 03:20.570
that it would be best
if things went back

03:20.637 --> 03:22.104
to the way they were before.

03:23.306 --> 03:24.841
Totally.

03:24.908 --> 03:26.743
I-I'm so glad you said that.

03:26.810 --> 03:28.611
I feel the exact same way.

03:30.781 --> 03:33.015
Okay.

03:38.389 --> 03:40.222
HENRY:
Am I late?

03:40.290 --> 03:42.392
No. I got here early.

03:42.459 --> 03:44.494
Didn't have much going on today.
Oh.

03:44.561 --> 03:46.729
Oh, uh, by the way, I, uh...

03:46.797 --> 03:49.064
I-I watched that <i>Good Will</i>
<i>Hunting</i> movie you recommended.

03:49.132 --> 03:51.567
That Ben Affleck
is something else.

03:51.635 --> 03:53.603
So, Kristen tells me

03:53.670 --> 03:55.805
you recently lost your renter.

03:55.873 --> 03:58.674
Yeah. I-I've been
interviewing for jobs,

03:58.742 --> 04:01.010
m-mostly at nonprofits.

04:01.077 --> 04:03.713
I decided I want to do
something that helps people,

04:03.781 --> 04:06.148
like maybe work
with mentally ill prisoners

04:06.216 --> 04:08.317
who don't have access
to good representation.

04:08.385 --> 04:10.820
Careful. Those cases
can be tough to litigate.

04:10.888 --> 04:13.689
I guess
it'll be a challenge, then.

04:13.757 --> 04:16.492
Or you could always
come back to the firm.

04:16.560 --> 04:19.327
(scoffs) You're joking, right?

04:19.396 --> 04:20.930
It'd be different this time.

04:20.997 --> 04:22.565
I've been talking
to the other partners

04:22.633 --> 04:24.767
about setting up
a pro bono division.

04:24.835 --> 04:27.437
And I'd love for you
to come back and manage it.

04:27.504 --> 04:29.672
That doesn't sound
like Goldsmith and Newman.

04:29.740 --> 04:31.874
Like I said, for our sake,

04:31.942 --> 04:34.644
I'm willing to change.

04:41.117 --> 04:43.419
Wilfred... you've got
to pick up your toys.

04:43.487 --> 04:45.054
Too busy right now.

04:45.121 --> 04:46.889
I'm in the midst
of a rigorous investigation.

04:46.957 --> 04:49.525
At 1:45 p.m. today,
Jenna went into the bank.

04:49.593 --> 04:52.294
At 1:48 p.m.,
she walked out.

04:52.362 --> 04:54.630
So, you see, there's a
missing three minutes.

04:54.698 --> 04:56.599
Just enough time for
her to take a ride

04:56.667 --> 04:58.634
on some bank
teller's moustache.

04:58.702 --> 05:00.736
You know, maybe we should
be putting our energy

05:00.804 --> 05:03.573
toward solving
bigger mysteries, like...

05:03.640 --> 05:06.375
We still don't know anything
about this symbol.

05:06.443 --> 05:07.643
What's the point?

05:07.711 --> 05:09.378
Kristen doesn't remember it.

05:09.446 --> 05:11.013
We've researched everything
from hieroglyphics

05:11.081 --> 05:13.048
to ancient mythology to aliens.

05:13.116 --> 05:14.717
Maybe it's just a doodle.

05:14.785 --> 05:16.418
This, on the other hand...

05:16.487 --> 05:20.222
This is a bomb that
needs to be defused now.

05:20.290 --> 05:22.525
Are you okay?

05:22.593 --> 05:24.694
You seem kind of anxious.

05:24.761 --> 05:27.797
No. No, it's just...

05:27.865 --> 05:30.032
I had lunch with my dad today.

05:30.100 --> 05:32.234
He offered me a job.

05:32.302 --> 05:34.336
I have to admit, it-it
sounds like maybe...

05:34.404 --> 05:36.305
Ryan, do not fall for this.

05:36.373 --> 05:38.173
I know things seem to be better

05:38.241 --> 05:39.742
between you and your dad
right now,

05:39.810 --> 05:41.090
but don't forget,
working for him

05:41.144 --> 05:42.612
is what made you get

05:42.679 --> 05:44.480
all kill-yourself-y
in the first place.

05:44.548 --> 05:46.281
You're right.

05:46.349 --> 05:47.917
Oh, by the way,

05:47.985 --> 05:49.385
I came up with a plan
to find out

05:49.452 --> 05:50.686
who Jenna's new bike seat is.

05:50.754 --> 05:52.889
I leave a bouquet of flowers,

05:52.956 --> 05:55.858
a heart-shaped box of chocolates
and an anonymous love note

05:55.926 --> 05:57.693
addressed to Jenna
on her doorstep,

05:57.761 --> 06:00.295
then we just wait to see
who she calls to thank.

06:00.363 --> 06:02.965
I-I don't think that's
such a good idea.

06:03.033 --> 06:05.067
Yeah, I hear you, but on
the other hand, you're wrong.

06:05.135 --> 06:06.536
It's genius, and I already

06:06.603 --> 06:08.083
left the gifts there
five minutes ago.

06:11.408 --> 06:13.275
Ryan, I thought we agreed.

06:13.343 --> 06:14.544
No, no.
It's not me.

06:14.611 --> 06:16.412
Someone's pulling a prank.

06:16.479 --> 06:18.599
Look, I know that I was the one
who kissed you, but...

06:18.615 --> 06:19.849
this isn't working.

06:19.917 --> 06:22.217
Maybe it's because so much

06:22.285 --> 06:24.453
of your life revolves around us.

06:24.521 --> 06:26.355
You don't have many
other friends, you...

06:26.423 --> 06:27.957
watch Wilfred all day...

06:28.025 --> 06:29.959
Wait, have you only
been doing that

06:30.027 --> 06:31.861
as a way to, like,
get close to me?

06:31.929 --> 06:34.430
What? No, of-of course not.

06:34.497 --> 06:36.298
Okay, it's obvious we
can't hang out anymore,

06:36.366 --> 06:37.299
like, at all.

06:37.367 --> 06:40.570
That goes for Wilfred, too.

06:40.637 --> 06:41.938
What are you saying?

06:42.005 --> 06:44.373
I want you
to stay away from him.

06:44.441 --> 06:45.775
Wilfred!

06:48.311 --> 06:49.612
Did she call him yet?

06:49.680 --> 06:50.880
Go inside, Wilfred.

06:50.948 --> 06:52.548
Get your filthy dick-mitts
off me!

06:52.616 --> 06:53.950
Go inside now!

06:54.017 --> 06:55.493
Ryan, why is she acting
like this?

06:55.613 --> 06:57.787
Ryan, what's happening?!

07:06.400 --> 07:09.386
Ugh, get this. Arturo wants
Joffrey to spend more time

07:09.506 --> 07:12.341
with the Ramos family
so he can learn Spanish.

07:12.409 --> 07:14.343
(scoffs) What's next,
landscaping camp?

07:14.411 --> 07:17.346
(chuckles) Are you listening?
This is important.

07:17.414 --> 07:19.381
Yeah. Sorry.
(phone vibrates)

07:19.449 --> 07:21.417
WILFRED:
Ryan, who is this imposter?

07:21.484 --> 07:24.019
And why aren't you walking...
Ooh, Wilfred, look.

07:24.087 --> 07:26.622
Do you see the squirrel
on the grass? Ooh.

07:26.690 --> 07:29.758
I see the squirrel, bitch!

07:29.826 --> 07:31.793
(sighs) Oh, Dad, um,

07:31.861 --> 07:33.495
told me about the job offer.

07:33.563 --> 07:36.098
It sounds tailor-made for you.
Yeah.

07:36.165 --> 07:38.800
I'm gonna turn it down.
Seriously?

07:38.868 --> 07:41.370
Look, I know you and Dad have
had your issues in the past,

07:41.438 --> 07:43.672
but it doesn't sound like there
are other offers on the table.

07:43.740 --> 07:45.741
At the very least, it'd get
you out of this house.

07:45.808 --> 07:47.643
Your life, it's so
claustrophobic, Ryan.

07:47.711 --> 07:49.245
I mean, all you do all day

07:49.312 --> 07:50.713
is hang out with that dog

07:50.780 --> 07:52.420
and get boners over
your married neighbor.

07:59.055 --> 08:01.022
(tapping at glass, clacking)

08:12.502 --> 08:14.970
WILFRED (over speaker):
Meet me out front. Over.

08:15.037 --> 08:17.037
(from outside): Or, actually,
meet me out the back.

08:20.677 --> 08:22.878
Why the hell did you...

08:22.945 --> 08:25.046
Shh. Don't speak.

08:26.616 --> 08:28.651
I just want to look
at you for a minute.

08:34.123 --> 08:37.626
So what's up, dude?

08:37.693 --> 08:38.960
N-Nothing.
You're the one

08:39.028 --> 08:40.227
who threw a brick
through my window.

08:40.297 --> 08:42.230
Oh, sorry, yeah.

08:42.299 --> 08:45.200
I just didn't know
how else to see you.

08:45.268 --> 08:47.670
I've really missed you
these last few days, mate.

08:47.737 --> 08:50.339
I know.

08:50.407 --> 08:51.707
I overheard Drew asking Jenna

08:51.775 --> 08:53.709
why you're not
dog-sitting anymore.

08:53.777 --> 08:57.112
She says you're
a bad influence.

08:57.180 --> 09:00.248
You don't discipline me,
you let me eat people food,

09:00.317 --> 09:03.084
you're not masculine enough
to be, like, a dog guy.

09:03.152 --> 09:04.872
Well, she didn't actually
say that last bit,

09:04.887 --> 09:06.254
but she kind of didn't have to.

09:07.924 --> 09:10.258
Well, I-I guess I am
pretty lenient with you.

09:10.327 --> 09:12.093
She probably has a point.

09:12.161 --> 09:14.262
Bullshit.

09:14.331 --> 09:16.965
It's bad enough she's joined the
face-rodeo behind Drew's back,

09:17.033 --> 09:19.067
but now she won't
let me see my best...

09:19.135 --> 09:20.469
(choked up):
...best friend.

09:20.537 --> 09:21.770
DREW:
Wilfy?

09:21.838 --> 09:23.505
Oh, shit.
Where are you, boy?

09:23.573 --> 09:25.474
I better get home.

09:27.677 --> 09:29.244
So, uh... (sniffs)

09:29.312 --> 09:30.979
I guess I'll see
you around, huh?

09:31.047 --> 09:32.848
DREW:
Wilfy!

09:32.915 --> 09:35.451
I just wish there was
some way around this.

09:35.518 --> 09:37.018
DREW:
Come here, boy.

09:40.357 --> 09:42.458
Ryan, what are you doing here?

09:42.525 --> 09:44.526
Look, I-I just wanted
to let you know

09:44.594 --> 09:46.261
that I've decided
to take a job.

09:46.329 --> 09:47.996
We won't really be
seeing each other.

09:48.064 --> 09:49.698
I figured it'd be
better that way.

09:51.334 --> 09:54.403
Well, I-I appreciate that.

09:54.471 --> 09:57.205
And since I won't be
around much anymore...

09:57.273 --> 09:59.808
maybe I could hang out with
Wilfred sometimes after work.

10:01.745 --> 10:03.379
Well, I don't think
it would hurt

10:03.446 --> 10:05.814
if you took Wilfred to
the dog park on the weekends.

10:05.882 --> 10:07.483
Drew can bring him over.

10:07.550 --> 10:08.984
Thanks.

10:09.051 --> 10:10.185
It means a lot.

10:15.492 --> 10:17.225
Mr. Newman.

10:17.293 --> 10:19.528
I'd heard some rumblings
you might be rejoining us.

10:19.596 --> 10:21.830
Yeah. I just wanted to give
the news to my father in person.

10:21.898 --> 10:23.499
ANNE: I don't give a shit
if he's in a meeting!

10:23.566 --> 10:25.801
Get him out of the meeting!

10:25.869 --> 10:27.349
SECRETARY: I can take
another message.

10:27.370 --> 10:29.237
ANNE:
I've left 1,000 messages!

10:29.305 --> 10:30.739
You know what?
I'm just gonna wait

10:30.807 --> 10:32.374
in Hank's office
until he can see me.

10:32.442 --> 10:33.942
No.
Anne?

10:34.010 --> 10:34.970
What are you doing here?

10:37.079 --> 10:38.280
Do you know my father?

10:38.347 --> 10:39.748
Yeah.

10:39.816 --> 10:41.216
Security is on its way, ma'am.

10:41.284 --> 10:42.984
You called security?
Uh-huh.

10:43.052 --> 10:44.486
Oh, eat ass.

10:44.554 --> 10:46.054
Wait, wait!

10:46.122 --> 10:47.162
How do you know my father?

10:48.658 --> 10:50.726
You know what?
Who gives a shit?

10:50.794 --> 10:53.962
Two weeks after I moved in,
your dad asked me to spy on you.

10:54.030 --> 10:55.597
What?
I know.

10:55.665 --> 10:57.198
It's a shitty thing to do,
and I'm probably

10:57.266 --> 10:59.067
gonna go to hell for it,
but he said he

10:59.135 --> 11:00.636
could pull some strings
with the parole board

11:00.703 --> 11:02.103
to get my boyfriend
out of jail early.

11:02.171 --> 11:04.873
I can't believe this.
And then, like, a day

11:04.941 --> 11:07.208
before his hearing, the
corrections officers bust him

11:07.276 --> 11:10.111
with one bag of heroin,
and suddenly your dad's like,

11:10.179 --> 11:12.047
"Oh, there's nothing I can do."

11:12.114 --> 11:14.450
Wait, wh-when you say "spy"...
Just, like,

11:14.517 --> 11:17.385
observe you
and report back to him, and then

11:17.454 --> 11:19.555
he had me put
tiny surveillance cameras

11:19.622 --> 11:21.790
around your house.
(gasps) W-Wait.

11:21.858 --> 11:23.459
Ow! Ow!
Wh-What did you tell him?

11:23.526 --> 11:25.060
You're hurting me!
What did he see?

11:25.127 --> 11:26.227
What does he know?!

11:29.382 --> 11:30.616
Ryan.
Anne?

11:31.733 --> 11:33.334
You put cameras in my house?

11:34.275 --> 11:35.912
Sit down, Ryan.

11:36.032 --> 11:37.510
What did you see
on those cameras?

11:40.815 --> 11:43.116
I'll show you.

11:51.759 --> 11:53.593
It's not gay.

11:53.661 --> 11:55.461
It's funny.
It's edgy.

11:55.529 --> 11:58.364
Wilfred, you put your penis
in my mouth while I was asleep.

11:58.432 --> 12:01.301
Then you took a picture of it
and put it on a coffee mug.

12:01.368 --> 12:03.136
What if someone
were to see this?

12:04.906 --> 12:07.107
There's no one else
in the house, Ryan.

12:07.175 --> 12:09.976
It's just you...
talking to the dog.

12:10.044 --> 12:12.345
I have hours of footage
like that.

12:12.413 --> 12:15.281
There's even one of you
wearing a shock collar.

12:15.349 --> 12:16.917
N-No, that...
I'm worried that if this continues,

12:16.984 --> 12:20.087
you'll end up doing
serious harm to someone.

12:20.154 --> 12:22.189
The dog, yourself.

12:22.256 --> 12:24.591
Which makes me feel
like you're not in a position

12:24.658 --> 12:26.827
to make right choices
for yourself.

12:26.894 --> 12:28.661
What does that mean?

12:28.730 --> 12:31.131
You can either spend some time
in a treatment facility...

12:31.199 --> 12:32.599
What?

12:32.666 --> 12:35.568
Or you can come work for me.
Ah,

12:35.636 --> 12:38.205
I get it. You got Anne
to dig up some dirt

12:38.272 --> 12:40.406
so you could blackmail me
into working for you again.

12:40.474 --> 12:42.375
Because why?
Because you couldn't handle

12:42.443 --> 12:44.644
not controlling
every little move I make?

12:44.712 --> 12:46.113
I-I know it looks that way.

12:46.180 --> 12:48.014
It always looks that way.

12:48.082 --> 12:49.883
It's like I said--
if you work here,

12:49.951 --> 12:51.584
it'll be different between us.

12:51.652 --> 12:54.821
Oh, the pro bono job.

12:54.889 --> 12:58.959
(scoffs)
Wow. I-I actually believed that.

12:59.026 --> 13:00.560
Ryan, I'm only trying

13:00.628 --> 13:01.728
to help you.

13:03.497 --> 13:05.465
You know what?

13:05.532 --> 13:08.468
It's true.
I do talk to Wilfred.

13:08.535 --> 13:11.104
He's the only one that's
actually helping me.

13:15.810 --> 13:17.610
WILFRED:
Jenna's in the shower,

13:17.678 --> 13:19.813
so I've only got a few minutes.
I just heard the good news.

13:19.881 --> 13:21.648
We're back, baby!

13:21.715 --> 13:24.050
Saturday afternoons
between 2:00 and 4:00 p.m.

13:24.118 --> 13:25.618
Hey, what's going on?

13:25.686 --> 13:27.053
My dad knows about us.

13:27.121 --> 13:28.521
He knows everything.

13:28.589 --> 13:29.989
He threatened
to institutionalize me

13:30.024 --> 13:31.624
if I didn't come back
to the firm.

13:31.692 --> 13:33.160
Holy shit.
You were right, Wilfred.

13:33.227 --> 13:35.695
I never should've
trusted him again.

13:35.763 --> 13:38.631
So what are you gonna do?
I-I'm just gonna

13:38.699 --> 13:41.067
take off and get as far away
from this shit as possible,

13:41.135 --> 13:42.402
live my own life.

13:42.469 --> 13:44.304
I'm coming with you.

13:45.739 --> 13:47.674
I've got nothing left here.

13:47.741 --> 13:50.343
Jenna's turned into a
real "Jizzed-on Jane."

13:50.411 --> 13:51.812
You really want to come with me?

13:51.879 --> 13:53.814
You're my best friend, Ryan.

13:53.881 --> 13:55.481
I love you.

13:55.549 --> 13:57.550
Of course I want to come.

14:00.721 --> 14:02.956
(exhales)

14:04.758 --> 14:07.093
What is that?

14:07.161 --> 14:09.129
I know that smell.

14:09.197 --> 14:11.832
Uh, it's probably my ChapStick.

14:15.303 --> 14:16.703
It was you.

14:16.770 --> 14:18.338
Now, hold on, Wilfred.

14:18.405 --> 14:20.273
It-it's complicated.
(knocking)

14:20.341 --> 14:22.142
Your face

14:22.210 --> 14:24.477
is the saddle Jenna's
been giddyupping on?

14:24.545 --> 14:26.146
No, no, no, no, no!
It was only one kiss.

14:26.147 --> 14:28.315
(shouts) Wilfred, stop!

14:28.382 --> 14:31.451
I'll eat your genitalia, bitch!
HENRY: Ryan?

14:31.518 --> 14:34.020
(Wilfred grunting)
HENRY: Ryan?

14:34.088 --> 14:35.922
Ryan!
WILFRED: You were supposed

14:35.990 --> 14:37.690
to be my best friend!

14:37.758 --> 14:39.192
I-I am!

14:39.260 --> 14:41.127
I didn't plan on it!
She kissed me!

14:41.195 --> 14:42.729
Besides, it's-it's over now!

14:42.796 --> 14:44.064
Oh, God. This is worse
than I thought.

14:44.131 --> 14:45.698
I'm taking you to get some help.

14:45.766 --> 14:48.301
Let go, Wilfred!
(Wilfred grunting)

14:48.369 --> 14:50.503
Let go! Bad dog!
Stay away from me!

14:50.571 --> 14:52.272
You've got nothing
to do with this!

14:52.340 --> 14:53.706
Ryan, you're not well.

14:53.774 --> 14:54.841
You have to... Whoa!

14:57.111 --> 14:59.045
Dad?

15:04.404 --> 15:06.405
(church bell ringing)

15:06.472 --> 15:07.631
Thanks for coming.

15:07.751 --> 15:10.776
I appreciate it.
Of course, Ryan.

15:12.312 --> 15:14.036
I'm sorry we can't stay long.

15:14.156 --> 15:16.648
We've got Wilfred in the car.

15:16.716 --> 15:18.817
I understand.

15:26.839 --> 15:28.794
I feel horrible
about this, mate.

15:28.861 --> 15:30.222
You don't have
to keep apologizing.

15:30.252 --> 15:31.820
It was a total accident.

15:31.887 --> 15:33.888
I only left my tennis ball there
in the hopes

15:33.956 --> 15:35.890
that someone would, like,
kick it down the stairs

15:35.958 --> 15:38.626
and I'd chase it down
and bring it back up to them

15:38.694 --> 15:40.195
and then repeat that, like,

15:40.262 --> 15:41.696
7,000 times in a row.

15:41.764 --> 15:43.031
I know.
It's okay, Wilfred.

15:43.099 --> 15:44.398
I'm willing to forget

15:44.466 --> 15:46.201
about you and Jenna.

15:46.268 --> 15:48.436
We've just got to put a stop
to all this fighting

15:48.503 --> 15:50.071
before someone gets hurt.

15:50.139 --> 15:51.806
You know what I mean.

15:51.874 --> 15:54.408
If it's any consolation,

15:54.476 --> 15:58.246
now that your dad's...
you know... you can

15:58.313 --> 16:01.082
finally feel free,
live your own life.

16:01.150 --> 16:03.351
Also,

16:03.418 --> 16:06.821
it's probably not the right time
to bring it up, but this...

16:06.889 --> 16:09.457
this is how you crack a window.

16:09.524 --> 16:10.591
Yep.

16:15.297 --> 16:17.632
Sorry for your loss, Ryan.

16:17.699 --> 16:20.501
Hank was always
so proud of you.

16:20.569 --> 16:22.904
I want you to know that even
with your father's passing,

16:22.972 --> 16:25.506
we'd still love for you to
oversee the pro bono division.

16:25.574 --> 16:27.776
Pro bono division?

16:27.843 --> 16:30.211
Uh, can't say I'm the biggest
supporter of the idea,

16:30.279 --> 16:32.981
but we've already found several
cases related to prisoners

16:33.048 --> 16:34.883
with mental health issues.

16:34.950 --> 16:38.119
Your father was
very specific about that.

16:41.757 --> 16:44.959
Do you think he was only
just trying to help us?

16:46.561 --> 16:49.497
When your dad had me committed,

16:49.564 --> 16:52.366
I know it crushed him.

16:52.434 --> 16:55.870
He was scared that you would
turn out the same way.

16:55.938 --> 17:00.608
So... he made you
into a little lawyer, which...

17:00.676 --> 17:03.711
must have given you
some kind of structure.

17:05.915 --> 17:09.250
You know, I don't think
I could've admitted this

17:09.318 --> 17:11.185
while he was
still alive, but...

17:11.252 --> 17:13.688
yeah, maybe, I think...

17:13.755 --> 17:17.692
he was actually
trying to help us.

17:17.759 --> 17:21.561
In his own dysfunctional,
dickheadish way.

17:29.538 --> 17:31.005
Hey, can you do me a tiny favor

17:31.073 --> 17:32.707
and smash this bit
of glass down here?

17:32.774 --> 17:35.076
You've always been against me
reconciling with my father.

17:35.144 --> 17:36.677
Since the day we met.
Look,

17:36.745 --> 17:38.346
as interesting as all this is,
I really need to...

17:38.413 --> 17:40.849
Oh, there we go. And I'm peeing.

17:40.916 --> 17:43.384
This past week,
I've been fighting so hard

17:43.452 --> 17:45.286
to save our friendship

17:45.354 --> 17:47.055
instead of focusing
on the relationship

17:47.122 --> 17:49.423
that actually mattered:
the one with my father.

17:49.491 --> 17:50.892
Ryan, what are you saying?

17:50.960 --> 17:53.361
I'm not well when I'm with you.

17:53.428 --> 17:55.763
I am so sick
of seeing everything

17:55.831 --> 17:57.598
through Wilfred-tinted lenses.

17:57.666 --> 17:58.532
