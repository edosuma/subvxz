How can they do that?

00:06.089 --> 00:09.093
And do you have to do that
right goddamn now?

00:10.302 --> 00:12.350
I actually don't have to do it ever.
(WHIRRING STOPS)

00:12.429 --> 00:15.433

again, why are you?

00:16.099 --> 00:18.522
(GRUNTS) How can they
seize my penthouse?

00:18.602 --> 00:20.195
Well, A,
they're the government,

00:20.270 --> 00:22.443
and B, ISIS owned
that penthouse, so...

00:22.523 --> 00:23.524
Since when?

00:23.607 --> 00:25.780
Since this new
thing called always?

00:26.443 --> 00:27.990
It never struck you as odd

00:28.070 --> 00:30.914
that you lived there for 10 years
and never paid a dime in rent?

00:31.198 --> 00:33.371
I just thought it was because
I banged the landlord's wife

00:33.450 --> 00:34.622
when she dropped off
the key.

00:35.619 --> 00:37.667
But I realize now
I was mistaken.

00:37.788 --> 00:40.041
Aw! What a scary
new feeling for you.

00:40.123 --> 00:41.500
Not as scary
as having to live

00:41.583 --> 00:44.006
in Casa de
Addams Family with you two!

00:44.628 --> 00:47.598
Ugh! No, I'm just working
here, not moving in.

00:47.673 --> 00:50.893
I was smart enough to put
my apartment in Ron's name.

00:50.968 --> 00:53.346
We all could've hidden our
assets if you'd warned us

00:53.428 --> 00:55.430
we were about to be
arrested for treason!

00:55.681 --> 00:59.185
Oh, for the love... How long are you
going to throw that in my face?

00:59.393 --> 01:00.986
Probably at least
through the weekend.

01:01.061 --> 01:02.938
Well, then you'll have
to throw it from Miami.

01:03.021 --> 01:04.944
Wait, no, why?

01:12.614 --> 01:13.615

Oh. You were serious?

01:25.502 --> 01:26.879
Did I not look serious?

01:26.962 --> 01:28.509
Well, maybe she
couldn't tell,

01:28.589 --> 01:30.466
because you seemed
pretty serious just now

01:30.549 --> 01:31.971
when you said you
set up a drug deal.

01:32.050 --> 01:34.098
How else are we
supposed to sell it?

01:34.177 --> 01:35.804
It's not like we
can have a yard sale.

01:35.929 --> 01:39.024
Yeah, Lana. Hello,
people would steal it.

01:39.099 --> 01:42.228
I realize we can't
have a yard sale.

01:42.311 --> 01:43.483
Plus it's illegal.

01:43.562 --> 01:44.734
My point

01:44.813 --> 01:49.114
is how did you, Malory, possibly
set up a major drug deal?

01:49.192 --> 01:50.785
Oh, don't worry
about that.

01:50.861 --> 01:52.283
Kind of feel like
I should.

01:52.362 --> 01:54.581
Just worry about not
screwing up this deal,

01:54.656 --> 01:58.286
because if all goes well, my
contact's people may buy the rest.

01:58.368 --> 02:00.086
And the sooner
we sell this cocaine,

02:00.162 --> 02:02.164
the sooner we'll
all be set for life.

02:02.247 --> 02:06.343
And the sooner we can move out of
this enormous Gilded Age mansion.

02:06.418 --> 02:08.294

it take him to move in?

02:16.303 --> 02:18.271
And so, the sooner
you go to Miami...

02:18.347 --> 02:20.270
Oh. I'm sorry,
let me eat 40 pounds

02:20.349 --> 02:22.147

You name it, kid,
savings bond, a puppy,

18:05.751 --> 18:07.298
breastfeed you senseless,

18:07.378 --> 18:09.346
just forgive me
for what's about to happen.

18:09.463 --> 18:10.464
(INHALES DEEPLY)

18:16.762 --> 18:19.641
LANA: So, um,
quick question.

18:21.684 --> 18:23.436
MALORY: Why the hell
were you kissing him?

18:23.519 --> 18:24.987
LANA: With what
appeared to be tongue.

18:25.062 --> 18:27.861
Because it was
<i>muy complicado,</i> Lana!

18:28.691 --> 18:30.819
And the last wish
of a dying man!

18:30.901 --> 18:32.403
Who you had
a crush on.

18:32.486 --> 18:33.612
No, I...

18:33.696 --> 18:35.323
Just go smoke
some menthols!

18:35.406 --> 18:37.454
All right,
Sterling, calm down.

18:37.533 --> 18:39.376
My God,
it's not as if I care.

18:39.493 --> 18:40.460
As long...

18:40.536 --> 18:41.537
As long as I brought
back the money!

18:41.621 --> 18:43.419
Is that what you were going to say?
Yes.

18:43.497 --> 18:44.999
And I don't
have time for this,

18:45.082 --> 18:47.210
I have a country
music star to manage.

18:47.293 --> 18:48.419
CHERYL: Says you!

18:48.502 --> 18:50.129
Says your contract, missy!

18:50.212 --> 18:51.714
Read it!
You read it!

18:53.966 --> 18:55.309
God damn it.

18:56.302 --> 18:59.351
And, I'm sorry, but the
money is where, exactly?

18:59.430 --> 19:01.774
Um... In your masturbators,
you idiot.

19:01.849 --> 19:03.476
Oh, (CHUCKLES)
I'm the idiot?

19:03.559 --> 19:04.560
I mean, historically.

19:04.644 --> 19:08.694
Well, I'm not the one who sold 20
kilos of coke for <i>Monopoly</i> money!

19:08.814 --> 19:09.986
What?

19:10.066 --> 19:12.945
(LAUGHING) It's counterfeit!
Every last bill!

19:13.027 --> 19:14.074
No!
No way.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.370
Son of a...

19:15.446 --> 19:19.167
Sterling, you fool, was this
all just a huge set-up?

19:19.241 --> 19:21.744
For what, Mother, a funeral?
They're all dead!

19:21.994 --> 19:24.873
Yeah, but are they?

19:25.539 --> 19:27.416
<i>We got out of there in a hurry.</i>
(SIRENS WAILING)

19:28.376 --> 19:29.844
(SOBBING) Ramón!

19:29.919 --> 19:31.171
Will you come on?

19:32.630 --> 19:35.474
But the gunshots,
all the blood.

19:36.050 --> 19:37.927
LANA:
<i>Blood packs and blanks.</i>

19:38.302 --> 19:39.679
ARCHER: <i>Even Ramón?</i>

19:39.762 --> 19:41.105
LANA: <i>Especially Ramón.</i>

19:41.764 --> 19:44.267
<i>I bet the whole
thing was his idea.</i>

19:45.351 --> 19:47.649
Aha! You're forgetting a key
piece of the puzzle, Lana!

19:47.728 --> 19:50.698
They'd already stolen our
coke, and they had the money!

19:50.773 --> 19:53.196
Why go to the trouble
of a fake shootout?

19:54.318 --> 19:55.319
CHARLES:
<i>See what I'm saying?</i>

19:55.778 --> 19:59.999
But this way, we have 20 kilos of
pure, uncut, Colombian cocaine.

20:00.074 --> 20:01.041
Holy shit, yes!

20:01.117 --> 20:04.417
Which we had already stolen,
so we still would've had it!

20:04.495 --> 20:07.749
Plus the counterfeit million
dollars, which now we don't have!

20:07.832 --> 20:09.630
Like, 50 times
I tried to explain this!

20:09.792 --> 20:12.636
Hmm. Yes, I see now
what you are saying.

20:12.878 --> 20:17.133
Ta-da! Jesus, it's like trying
to explain particle physics to

20:17.216 --> 20:18.308
a particle.

20:18.384 --> 20:20.136
Aha!
But this way, my way,

20:20.219 --> 20:21.687
Archer thinks we are dead.

20:21.762 --> 20:24.436
So he will never think to
come looking for us again!

20:26.892 --> 20:29.065
It was still a stupid,

20:29.145 --> 20:32.365
stupid, stupid,

20:32.440 --> 20:36.786
stupid, stupid, stupid,
stupid, stupid plan.
