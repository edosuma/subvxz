I just don't really know
what to do with her,

so can you just take her
with you? I'll stay here.

10:19.797 --> 10:21.005
- Show her to the ewes.
Guaranteed hit.

10:21.005 --> 10:22.755
She'll love 'em.
- I don't really feel

10:22.755 --> 10:24.213
that comfortable, Ian.
Can you just...

10:24.213 --> 10:25.713
just take her with you.

- Well, Nathan, I'm sorry,
but that's kinda huge, right,

11:15.797 --> 11:18.130
that means my business
is actually in business.

11:18.130 --> 11:20.588
- Great! Means your investment
wasn't in vein.

11:20.588 --> 11:22.755
Money well spent.

11:22.755 --> 11:24.797
- Yeah. (Chuckles nervously)

11:24.797 --> 11:27.422
- Isn't there anything
you wanna tell me?

11:28.463 --> 11:30.422
- What's happening?

11:30.422 --> 11:33.130
- Like you don't have cancer?
- Oh God!

11:33.130 --> 11:36.047
Nathan, I wanted to tell you,
but...

11:36.047 --> 11:37.922
- But what? You don't tell me
anything!

11:37.922 --> 11:39.380
First it was Frankie moving in.

11:39.380 --> 11:40.755
Then it was you using
the settlement money

11:40.755 --> 11:43.005
to start a business, and
running it out of our house!

11:43.005 --> 11:44.838
And now I have to hear
from Rosie, of all people,

11:44.838 --> 11:46.713
that you might've had cancer!

11:46.713 --> 11:48.838
But wait, good news, you don't.

11:48.838 --> 11:51.880
So you throw a party.
With your friends.

11:51.880 --> 11:53.297
Like I don't even fucking exist.

11:53.297 --> 11:54.630
- Okay, well hold on.

11:54.630 --> 11:56.505
This all happened while you
were outta town, okay.

11:56.505 --> 11:58.838
I went to the doctor because
I was feeling really tired,

11:58.838 --> 12:01.630
and he didn't like
explicitly say

12:01.630 --> 12:03.088
that I have cancer.

12:03.088 --> 12:05.088
Well, anyway, I used you know,
the internet for like,

12:05.088 --> 12:06.838
a second opinion.
- Why wouldn't you call me?

12:06.838 --> 12:09.255
- I-I, you know, I got scared,
and I started feeling guilty,

12:09.255 --> 12:11.672
and then I like,
was envisioning like,

12:11.672 --> 12:13.505
leaving you and Charlie alone.

12:13.505 --> 12:15.880
I don't know! I just got like,
lost in the whole thing.

12:15.880 --> 12:21.213
And then I found out that
I actually have... a...

12:22.338 --> 12:24.505
- You have what, Kate?
- Well...

12:25.755 --> 12:29.338
- Kate!
- I got peri-menopause.

12:30.838 --> 12:33.005
- Menopause.
How's that even possible?

12:33.005 --> 12:35.047
Unless you're lying
about your age, too?

12:35.047 --> 12:38.880
- Peri-menopause. It's not like
menopause, menopause,

12:38.880 --> 12:41.963
it's like younger. It's like
the sexy, it's sexy menopause.

12:41.963 --> 12:43.755
- What the fuck
are you talking about?

12:43.755 --> 12:45.422
- It means I still get
pregnant,

12:45.422 --> 12:46.922
but my door is closing.

12:46.922 --> 12:48.547
- When were you gonna tell me
about that?

12:48.547 --> 12:50.130
- To be honest?
- Yes, please,

12:50.130 --> 12:52.547
that would be refreshing.
- I-I've been scared to, okay,

12:52.547 --> 12:54.713
because I finally get my
business up and running,

12:54.713 --> 12:57.380
and I know how much you
want a second child.

12:57.380 --> 12:59.130
- Since when do you care
about what I want?

12:59.130 --> 13:00.547
- Well...
- You just go ahead and do

13:00.547 --> 13:02.463
whatever it is you want,
every time anyways.

13:02.463 --> 13:04.505
Just keep me in the dark,
so I don't get in your way.

13:04.505 --> 13:05.755
- Okay, hold on. Nathan,

13:05.755 --> 13:07.922
- Don't bother. I'm goin' out.
- Wait.

13:07.922 --> 13:09.422
Nathan...

13:09.422 --> 13:10.505
(Door opens and slams shut)

13:12.922 --> 13:15.130
So goddamn hot in here.
Menopause.

<i> Ian: What did you mean when</i>
<i> you said you don't do kids?</i>

13:20.047 --> 13:22.672
- Uh, it means that
I can't have kids.

13:23.672 --> 13:27.755
My ex-husband and I tried to
have kids for like, six years.

13:27.755 --> 13:29.880
And I've had more miscarriages
than you can--

13:29.880 --> 13:31.588
(Chokes up)

13:33.005 --> 13:34.713

13:35.755 --> 13:37.547
I had no idea.
- How could you?

13:38.838 --> 13:41.338
It's not something
I usually open with.

13:41.338 --> 13:43.380
Anyways, I know that I'm
getting ahead of myself here,

13:43.380 --> 13:44.755
but I have to,

13:44.755 --> 13:46.755
because I don't think that
I can take another loss.

13:48.047 --> 13:50.797
Look at her, she's everything
that I've always wanted,

13:50.797 --> 13:53.505
and now that you have Zoe
full time,

13:53.505 --> 13:55.797
I-I just don't want
to get attached to her,

13:55.797 --> 13:58.088
in case things don't work out
between you and me.

13:59.797 --> 14:02.213
What? N-n-n-n-no, you don't
need to hide her. Stop it.

14:02.213 --> 14:04.005
It's not her fault.

14:04.005 --> 14:06.922
It's not your fault... either.

14:06.922 --> 14:09.088
(Silence)

14:09.088 --> 14:13.047
Listen, I think that it would
be best for all of us,

14:13.047 --> 14:14.838
Zoe included,

14:14.838 --> 14:17.297
if I just walk away right now,

17:31.338 --> 17:32.963
Ladies, to what do I owe

17:32.963 --> 17:35.588
- Shut the door, and take
a seat, Dr. Heshinton.

17:40.338 --> 17:42.047
- Anne!

17:42.047 --> 17:44.005
- Brad.

17:44.005 --> 17:45.838

17:47.422 --> 17:50.255

what exactly is going on?

17:50.255 --> 17:51.630
- Sit down, Brad.

17:53.713 --> 17:56.963
These ladies have presented
an affidavit

17:56.963 --> 17:58.963
with very damaging,

17:58.963 --> 18:01.172
and frankly, disturbing
stories about you.

18:04.922 --> 18:07.297
- Well, I'm sure there's
a misunderstanding there?

it doesn't appear

18:10.005 --> 18:11.755
to be a misunderstanding.

18:11.755 --> 18:13.338
- What are you talking about?

18:13.338 --> 18:15.588
- You always told me that I
should be a better listener.

Okay, you're...

18:51.213 --> 18:53.922
you, John, you're hearing
from my lawyer about this.

18:53.922 --> 18:55.880
- I'd say a lawyer was
a good idea, Brad.

18:55.880 --> 18:57.630
As of this morning,
I've alerted the Board

18:57.630 --> 18:59.922
that you're no longer a
professor on staff, here.

18:59.922 --> 19:02.047
- Oh!
- I've also filed a complaint

19:02.047 --> 19:04.255
with the Medical Counsel
of Canada.

19:06.005 --> 19:09.172
- John, no-no... okay.

19:09.172 --> 19:12.130
(Whispers) Hold on. Um...

19:12.130 --> 19:14.838

your last mind.

Hey! Where'd you go?

19:51.047 --> 19:52.588
- Went out for a drive.

19:52.588 --> 19:54.463
(Light clicks on)

19:56.797 --> 19:59.338

about what you said.

19:59.338 --> 20:01.005
And you're right.

20:01.005 --> 20:03.088
Look, I don't want a baby
right now,
