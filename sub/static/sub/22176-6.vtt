Yeah, but I sent it over
to my guys at the NSA

41:48.040 --> 41:50.420
for analysis anyway.
See that?

41:50.420 --> 41:53.000
-What am I looking at, static?
-No, it's not static.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.960
That's corrupted data
from a previous recording.

41:54.960 --> 41:56.620
Someone taped over
the original footage.

41:56.620 --> 41:57.750
Were you able to recover it?

41:57.750 --> 41:59.040
Just one frame.

42:01.830 --> 42:03.420
Is that...?

42:03.420 --> 42:05.540
Quinn, on her way
to her wedding.

42:05.540 --> 42:08.830
That's QPA's elevator.
She didn't get cold feet.

42:08.830 --> 42:11.540
She's not out there building
a case against us.

42:11.540 --> 42:14.500
She was taken
from this elevator.

42:14.500 --> 42:17.670
-The question is...
-Who took her?

42:17.670 --> 42:20.120
