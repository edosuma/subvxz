00:04.350 --> 00:05.599
Eren.

00:05.600 --> 00:07.060
You're a man!

00:07.900 --> 00:11.300
Show some restraint!
You need to be there for Mikasa, too!

00:12.360 --> 00:15.650
Stop!

02:06.980 --> 02:11.980
"Scream"

02:16.360 --> 02:17.530
Damn that Reiner!

02:17.860 --> 02:20.030
He's tossing Titans like a madman!

02:35.960 --> 02:37.629
This is all your fault!

02:37.630 --> 02:42.680
It's you who screwed up my entire plan,
you damn commander!

02:50.060 --> 02:51.020
Ymir!

02:51.310 --> 02:52.559
Conny, that way!

02:52.560 --> 02:53.700
I know!

02:56.860 --> 02:58.010
Commander!

02:59.490 --> 03:01.350
I can always be replaced.

03:02.110 --> 03:04.780
More importantly, find Eren and retreat!

03:05.620 --> 03:07.330
Time is of the essence!

03:20.170 --> 03:21.050
Eren!

03:26.470 --> 03:27.480
Hannes!

03:34.360 --> 03:36.189
What are the odds of this?!

03:36.190 --> 03:37.900
Check it out, you two!

03:38.570 --> 03:39.939
You just watch.

03:39.940 --> 03:44.780
I'm about to avenge your mother
and butcher the shit out of this!

03:48.870 --> 03:49.750
Hannes!

03:51.000 --> 03:52.500
Give the old man backup!

03:53.220 --> 03:54.040
Huh?!

04:01.170 --> 04:03.130
Reiner? What's he doing?!

04:04.130 --> 04:06.550
Does he not care if Eren is eaten?!

04:06.760 --> 04:10.520
Don't get in our way, you big sack of shit!

04:18.610 --> 04:19.570
Ymir!

04:21.399 --> 04:24.010
Dammit... What am I supposed to do?

04:24.700 --> 04:26.206
If I can't count on Reiner,

04:26.231 --> 04:29.354
should I cooperate with the Scouts
and try to survive?

04:32.290 --> 04:34.620
But what happens after that?

04:35.710 --> 04:38.959
Even if I can somehow
live through all this...

04:38.960 --> 04:43.060
...there's no avoiding the hell
that's to come trapped inside the walls.

04:44.090 --> 04:47.530
Now's my only chance
to hand Historia over to their side!

04:48.180 --> 04:51.790
I won't be able to protect her alone,
no matter how hard I try.

04:56.940 --> 04:57.940
Christa!

04:58.520 --> 05:00.150
Conny, that's wrong.

05:00.770 --> 05:02.920
My name is Historia.

05:04.150 --> 05:06.360
Hey, Ymir...

05:07.110 --> 05:10.200
Why was it you were trying to take me away?

05:10.950 --> 05:13.740
You said it was to save yourself,
but was that a lie?

05:15.910 --> 05:18.280
No... it has to be.

05:19.920 --> 05:23.170
Why? Why did you do it?

05:27.300 --> 05:28.550
For me?

05:30.180 --> 05:32.010
To protect me again?

05:33.270 --> 05:34.260
It's a Titan!

05:37.600 --> 05:39.059
Ymir...

05:39.060 --> 05:42.650
You're the one who said it,
so listen to yourself!

05:44.190 --> 05:46.739
Stop living for other people!

05:46.740 --> 05:50.520
From now on, let's live
for nobody but ourselves!

05:51.830 --> 05:53.949
It's strange, really...

05:53.950 --> 05:56.910
When I'm with you,
no matter how screwed up it gets...

05:57.920 --> 05:59.360
...I'm not afraid!

06:07.420 --> 06:08.050
Shit!

06:19.770 --> 06:22.110
Don't, Mikasa! You're injured!

06:24.400 --> 06:26.069
Untie my hands!

06:26.070 --> 06:26.740
Hands?

06:27.820 --> 06:29.109
Hurry up!

06:29.110 --> 06:31.320
I've gotta be the one to do it!

06:33.330 --> 06:35.660
Who said I was done with you?!

06:37.790 --> 06:39.789
That one's... mine!

06:39.790 --> 06:40.660
Eren!

06:41.500 --> 06:44.290
Wait! We're trying to get you out of here!

06:44.840 --> 06:47.129
It's time to settle the score!

06:47.130 --> 06:47.760
Just watch!

06:57.100 --> 06:58.430
Huh?!

07:04.610 --> 07:05.570
Commander!

07:06.150 --> 07:06.900
The Armored one is...

07:08.650 --> 07:10.040
It's coming!

07:14.240 --> 07:15.010
Jean!

07:20.290 --> 07:21.270
Jean!

07:22.830 --> 07:23.940
Are you okay?!

07:24.710 --> 07:26.440
Hold it together!

07:31.880 --> 07:33.030
Shit!

07:33.720 --> 07:35.180
Shit!

07:36.680 --> 07:38.350
What's wrong?!

07:42.020 --> 07:42.770
Eren!

08:03.290 --> 08:04.450
Commander!

08:25.020 --> 08:26.559
Right now...

08:26.560 --> 08:28.770
...I've gotta become a Titan...

08:31.490 --> 08:33.280
...or it's all for nothing!

09:16.160 --> 09:16.820
Eren...

09:18.370 --> 09:19.530
Nothing changed!

09:20.160 --> 09:22.880
You haven't changed one bit, dammit!

09:23.950 --> 09:26.850
You're still as useless as you ever were!

09:28.880 --> 09:30.630
Nothing changed!

09:41.680 --> 09:42.920
Mom...

09:43.720 --> 09:45.610
I... can't...

09:46.890 --> 09:50.190
I still... can't do anything at all.

09:51.440 --> 09:52.650
Eren...

09:59.990 --> 10:01.600
That's not true.

10:21.850 --> 10:22.640
Eren...

10:24.260 --> 10:25.150
Listen...

10:27.060 --> 10:28.660
...I need to tell you something.

10:33.860 --> 10:37.030
You've always... been at my side.

10:37.860 --> 10:38.900
Thank you.

10:43.330 --> 10:47.290
You showed me... how to live with purpose.

10:49.080 --> 10:50.220
Thank you.

10:56.130 --> 10:57.050
And you...

11:00.840 --> 11:02.690
You wrapped this scarf around me.

11:03.260 --> 11:04.260
Thank you.

11:27.450 --> 11:29.000
I'll wrap that around you...

11:29.690 --> 11:31.400
as many times as you want.

11:34.210 --> 11:37.880
Now and forever... As much as you want!

12:40.360 --> 12:42.820
Why... are they...?

12:43.530 --> 12:44.860
They're eating it?

12:50.950 --> 12:53.459
Dunno what's going on,
but now's our chance!

12:53.460 --> 12:54.869
Let's hurry and run!

12:54.870 --> 12:55.700
Right!

12:56.130 --> 12:57.660
So that's how it is...

12:58.170 --> 13:00.550
That's why Reiner was so
desperate for Eren.

13:01.880 --> 13:03.920
Which means, even inside the walls...

13:05.220 --> 13:06.510
...there's a future.

13:10.970 --> 13:12.380
This is the worst...

13:13.180 --> 13:15.439
Why did the Coordinate have to fall into

13:15.440 --> 13:18.180
the hands of the worst person imaginable?

13:18.400 --> 13:20.230
We've gotta get it back...

13:20.860 --> 13:23.990
I can say... without a doubt...

13:24.490 --> 13:27.240
...the one person in the world
I wouldn't want to have it...

13:27.870 --> 13:30.240
...Eren... is you!

13:31.450 --> 13:32.910
Get away from me!

13:34.080 --> 13:37.210
You bastards! I'll kill you all!

13:46.050 --> 13:48.340
Not good! Bertholdt!

13:49.640 --> 13:51.430
I can't protect Bertholdt like this!

13:51.640 --> 13:53.599
What? The Titans?

13:53.600 --> 13:54.380
Eren!

13:56.100 --> 13:56.890
Get on!

13:56.890 --> 13:57.770
Armin!

13:58.980 --> 13:59.690
Hurry!

14:00.600 --> 14:02.350
Don't let this chance escape!

14:02.900 --> 14:04.440
Full retreat!

14:13.450 --> 14:14.320
Ymir!

14:15.000 --> 14:18.080
Hey, ugly! What are you doing?!
We're heading back!

14:29.180 --> 14:30.990
I sorry...

14:32.640 --> 14:33.570
Huh?

14:39.060 --> 14:41.269
Ymir! Where are you going?!

14:41.270 --> 14:41.900
Leave her!

14:41.901 --> 14:43.110
But Ymir is...

15:04.840 --> 15:10.020
In that moment, I couldn't understand
the motivation behind Ymir's actions...

15:11.220 --> 15:14.830
...but the Armored Titan
didn't pursue us any further.

15:56.470 --> 15:57.180
Ymir...

15:58.060 --> 16:00.050
Why did you come to us?

16:00.850 --> 16:03.649
Oh, well...

16:03.650 --> 16:05.630
It's because I'm an idiot.

16:06.230 --> 16:09.190
I'll be your souvenir to take back home.

16:10.690 --> 16:13.360
You can't just go back empty-handed.

16:14.280 --> 16:15.310
Ymir...

16:16.490 --> 16:19.120
If you hadn't come to bust up this wall...

16:20.040 --> 16:22.730
...I would've never woken up
from that nightmare.

16:24.290 --> 16:25.780
All I'm doing...

16:26.840 --> 16:29.510
...is returning what I borrowed back then.

16:31.630 --> 16:36.270
Because I'm probably the only one
that understands the situation you're in.

16:38.510 --> 16:41.100
Thank you, Ymir.

16:41.810 --> 16:42.810
I'm sorry...

16:44.400 --> 16:45.370
No...

16:49.320 --> 16:53.010
It wasn't so bad, you know...
being a goddess for a while.

16:58.030 --> 17:02.329
With reports declaring the possibility
that Wall Rose has been breached,

17:02.330 --> 17:05.358
the citizens of Wall
Rose were forced to take

17:05.359 --> 17:08.339
refuge in an underground
city within Wall Sina.

17:09.800 --> 17:12.519
However, with more than half the

17:12.520 --> 17:16.489
population surviving off food
stockpiled for emergency,

17:16.490 --> 17:18.740
rations would last at most for a week.

17:20.180 --> 17:24.079
Any longer than that, and people
would turn on each other,

17:24.079 --> 17:26.740
stealing and killing to survive.

17:28.190 --> 17:32.899
To stop this from happening,
within one week from the initial outset,

17:32.900 --> 17:36.520
authorities declared that
Wall Rose was secure.

17:38.200 --> 17:42.240
"Trost District"

17:48.790 --> 17:50.169
It's Hange.

17:50.170 --> 17:50.980
Come in.

17:51.590 --> 17:53.480
Pardon the interruption, Erwin.

17:56.010 --> 17:58.710
I'm glad we came while you're here,
Commander Pyxis.

18:00.180 --> 18:02.769
Good timing. This is...

18:02.770 --> 18:06.599
A Scout from the 104th. Conny Springer.

18:06.600 --> 18:08.980
Conny comes from Ragako Village.

18:10.360 --> 18:13.689
The village the recent
Titan invasion originated from?

18:13.690 --> 18:14.330
Yes.

18:15.190 --> 18:19.520
Actually, I confirmed with him the findings
of our investigation on the village.

18:20.030 --> 18:23.369
This only brings further credibility
to that hypothesis.

18:23.370 --> 18:25.370
He's come to report.

18:30.170 --> 18:31.950
I was taken away...

18:32.750 --> 18:38.130
And because of that, the Scouts lost
more than half their veteran soldiers.

18:39.720 --> 18:41.570
Just to rescue me...

18:44.100 --> 18:47.180
Still, there were no
casualties on our way back.

18:48.230 --> 18:52.940
The Titans completely ignored us
and ran off to chase Reiner and the others.

18:53.900 --> 18:57.490
About that, Jean and I sat down
to try and figure it out.

18:59.860 --> 19:02.780
We have an idea what made
the Titans act that way.

19:04.240 --> 19:05.290
It was you.

19:07.580 --> 19:09.830
Of course, that's just our theory.

19:10.920 --> 19:15.550
But without assuming that,
there's just no explaining what happened.

19:17.210 --> 19:19.420
It's a tough spot to be in, Eren.

19:19.970 --> 19:22.550
Whether or not all those
people died for nothing...

19:23.510 --> 19:25.470
...it all depends on you.

19:26.560 --> 19:30.520
If you're worth the price they paid,
you better show it.

19:32.270 --> 19:34.040
We don't have time to waste.

19:39.530 --> 19:42.450
Yeah, you're absolutely right.

19:44.410 --> 19:46.159
I've gotta do this.

19:46.160 --> 19:47.870
I'll control the Titans.

19:48.580 --> 19:50.120
I'll plug up Wall Maria.

19:50.790 --> 19:53.670
I'll capture Reiner and make him pay.

19:54.840 --> 19:58.540
That's what I've gotta do
to atone for all those lives lost.

20:01.760 --> 20:02.630
Say again?

20:04.430 --> 20:09.020
The Titans responsible for this incident...
were the citizens of Ragako?

20:11.350 --> 20:14.330
In other words, the true
identity of Titans...

20:15.440 --> 20:16.880
...is humans?

20:20.570 --> 20:23.190
We don't... have proof yet.

20:24.110 --> 20:26.200
So... you're telling me...

20:27.330 --> 20:30.230
...I've spent all this time and energy

20:31.440 --> 20:34.050
running around killing people?

20:34.790 --> 20:35.560
Is that right?

20:37.750 --> 20:39.960
I said we don't have proof yet.

20:51.350 --> 20:52.280
Erwin.

20:55.730 --> 20:58.570
Hey. Tell me.

20:59.150 --> 21:00.520
The hell you smiling for?

21:05.170 --> 21:06.690
It's nothing.

21:09.580 --> 21:10.810
It's just...

21:11.580 --> 21:15.520
...with this, we've taken
one more step towards the truth.

21:17.580 --> 21:19.210
Just one step, huh?

21:19.960 --> 21:23.010
We'll run out of people
before we learn the truth.

21:23.590 --> 21:25.150
It's not worth the cost.

21:26.430 --> 21:28.350
But it is a step towards the truth.

21:29.810 --> 21:32.400
One day, we'll break it down.

21:33.730 --> 21:35.520
This wall hiding the truth...

21:37.560 --> 21:38.580
...will fall.

22:08.300 --> 22:09.600
Not yet, eh?
