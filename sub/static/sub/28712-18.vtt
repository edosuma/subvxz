WEBVTT

00:01.835 --> 00:05.130
NARRATOR:
The fruit of a tree
that forever alters humanity.

00:05.130 --> 00:08.967
DAVID CHILDRESS:
This serpent being offers them
some special food to eat,

00:08.967 --> 00:11.845
and suddenly we have
a fundamental change.

00:11.845 --> 00:15.766
NARRATOR:
A drink that grants
everlasting life.

00:15.766 --> 00:19.061
JOSHUA CUTCHIN:
This liquid could convey
immortality upon

00:19.061 --> 00:20.562
those who consumed it.

00:20.562 --> 00:22.898
NARRATOR:
And a nourishing substance

00:22.898 --> 00:25.025
that rains down from the sky.

00:25.025 --> 00:28.946
GIORGIO A. TSOUKALOS:
This machine was given
to the Israelites

00:28.946 --> 00:30.530
by extraterrestrials.

00:30.530 --> 00:33.408
NARRATOR:
In every religious tradition,

00:33.408 --> 00:37.079
there are foods believed
to possess extraordinary power,

00:37.079 --> 00:40.123
and some that are even consumed

00:40.123 --> 00:42.084
by the gods themselves.

00:42.084 --> 00:44.920
The gods ate, the gods drank,

00:44.920 --> 00:46.547
and this is what
kept them divine.

00:46.547 --> 00:48.590
NARRATOR:
But is it possible that what

00:48.590 --> 00:50.551
our ancestors described as gods

00:50.551 --> 00:54.596
were, in fact, visitors
from another world?

00:54.596 --> 00:57.474
And if so, might the food
of these gods

00:57.474 --> 00:59.643
reveal a powerful link

00:59.643 --> 01:03.522
to mankind's
extraterrestrial origins?

01:03.522 --> 01:06.400
WILLIAM HENRY:
These foods were
directly introduced into

01:06.400 --> 01:09.695
the human experience
in order to awaken us

01:09.695 --> 01:12.155
and to bring us closer
to the gods.

01:14.741 --> 01:17.035
NARRATOR:
There is a doorway

01:17.035 --> 01:19.788
in the universe.

01:19.788 --> 01:22.833
Beyond it is
the promise of truth.

01:24.167 --> 01:26.545
It demands
we question everything

01:26.545 --> 01:28.839
we have ever been taught.

01:28.839 --> 01:32.759
The evidence is all around us.

01:32.759 --> 01:36.597
The future is
right before our eyes.

01:36.597 --> 01:39.266
We are not alone.

01:39.266 --> 01:42.603
We have never <i>been</i> alone.

01:50.777 --> 01:54.197
NARRATOR:
As humanity prepares
to travel to other worlds,

01:54.197 --> 01:57.492
one of the biggest challenges
facing scientists

01:57.492 --> 01:59.578
is how to provide sustenance

01:59.578 --> 02:02.789
beyond that found
on planet Earth.

02:02.789 --> 02:05.500
When we think of
the early pioneers, uh,

02:05.500 --> 02:08.128
we think
of "living off the land."

02:08.128 --> 02:10.589
You can't do that
in outer space.

02:10.589 --> 02:14.134
There's no soil,
there's no oxygen,

02:14.134 --> 02:16.637
there's very little
of the basic ingredients

02:16.637 --> 02:19.514
that we take for granted
on the planet Earth.

02:19.514 --> 02:21.141
So living in outer space

02:21.141 --> 02:24.686
presents a whole new set
of challenges.

02:24.686 --> 02:27.397
NARRATOR:
Currently, NASA researchers

02:27.397 --> 02:30.942
are experimenting
with various possible solutions

02:30.942 --> 02:34.988
to the problem of keeping humans
fed during long‐term missions.

02:34.988 --> 02:38.200
BILL BIRNES:
For long expeditions in space,

02:38.200 --> 02:41.078
there are really three things
we have to do.

02:41.078 --> 02:44.122
One, either bring
our food with us,

02:44.122 --> 02:47.709
wherever we go,
take the food, wagon train.

02:47.709 --> 02:51.880
Two, terraform a planet,

02:51.880 --> 02:54.925
or find a planet
where we can already grow food

02:54.925 --> 02:56.468
that can sustain us.

02:56.468 --> 02:58.720
Or three,

02:58.720 --> 03:02.891
change our own metabolism,
so that we can exist

03:02.891 --> 03:04.810
on a whole different kind
of food.

03:04.810 --> 03:09.022
NARRATOR:
But is it even possible
to sustain life

03:09.022 --> 03:10.857
in the vacuum of space?

03:10.857 --> 03:15.696
In recent years, biologists
have discovered organisms

03:15.696 --> 03:19.241
on our planet that can thrive
in extreme conditions,

03:19.241 --> 03:23.412
like those found in the deepest
depths of Earth's oceans.

03:23.412 --> 03:26.373
KIRSTEN FISHER:
The prevailing assumption
was that there wasn't much life

03:26.373 --> 03:27.749
at the bottom of the ocean.

03:27.749 --> 03:31.086
So this idea that,
um, the deep sea,

03:31.086 --> 03:33.797
um, could actually contain life

03:33.797 --> 03:36.550
was pretty phenomenal because
I think we had assumed that,

03:36.550 --> 03:38.260
without light,
we couldn't have life.

03:38.260 --> 03:41.930
So the existence
of whole ecosystems

03:41.930 --> 03:44.474
that are supported
by chemical reactions

03:44.474 --> 03:45.725
that don't need light

03:45.725 --> 03:48.228
to generate biomolecules
and energy,

03:48.228 --> 03:51.106
I think,
was really revolutionary.

03:51.106 --> 03:55.735
NARRATOR:
But could the key to mankind's
survival on other worlds

03:55.735 --> 03:58.071
be found not in a laboratory

03:58.071 --> 04:02.659
but by studying past accounts
of extraterrestrial encounters?

04:04.703 --> 04:07.747
Eagle River, Wisconsin.

04:07.747 --> 04:11.126
April 18, 1961.

04:11.126 --> 04:13.336
Plumber Joe Simonton

04:13.336 --> 04:15.589
is finishing his lunch
when he notices

04:15.589 --> 04:17.591
a metallic saucer‐shaped craft

04:17.591 --> 04:21.386
landing just outside
his kitchen window.

04:22.929 --> 04:26.016
I raced out to see what it was,
and by that time

04:26.016 --> 04:28.477
there was a hatchway opening up
in the top of it,

04:28.477 --> 04:30.520
just like the trunk of your car,

04:30.520 --> 04:32.689
and in there there stood
a little man‐‐

04:32.689 --> 04:35.275
I'd say a little man
about five foot tall‐‐

04:35.275 --> 04:38.570
holding up a jug, and
he motioned he wanted a drink,

04:38.570 --> 04:41.740
he motioned for water,
so I walked up to him

04:41.740 --> 04:45.786
to get this jug and, uh,
I looked at his eyes,

04:45.786 --> 04:48.580
and they were so penetrating
that I had to look away.

04:48.580 --> 04:53.293
NARRATOR:
Simonton took the container
and filled it with water.

04:53.293 --> 04:56.463
When he returned
to the flying saucer,

04:56.463 --> 04:58.131
he noticed a second being

04:58.131 --> 05:01.802
with what appeared to be
food‐like wafers.

05:01.802 --> 05:04.054
SIMONTON:
He didn't say a word,
he just reached forward

05:04.054 --> 05:05.806
and he got a handful of 'em,
four of 'em,

05:05.806 --> 05:09.643
and he handed down to me,
which I have one here yet.

05:09.643 --> 05:13.939
NARRATOR:
According to Simonton, the two
aliens promptly closed the hatch

05:13.939 --> 05:15.565
and took off.

05:15.565 --> 05:17.359
SIMONTON:
Within, uh,
two or three seconds,

05:17.359 --> 05:18.652
it was out of sight.

05:18.652 --> 05:20.403
Well, there I stood
in the driveway,

05:20.403 --> 05:22.989
wondering what the heck I'd saw,
what had happened.

05:22.989 --> 05:26.201
And, uh, if that was their food,

05:26.201 --> 05:28.703
God help them because I took
a bite of one of 'em

05:28.703 --> 05:31.164
and it tasted like
a piece of cardboard.

05:34.459 --> 05:37.087
NARRATOR:
The case immediately
garnered the attention

05:37.087 --> 05:41.341
of U. S. government agencies
looking into the UFO phenomenon,

05:41.341 --> 05:44.094
including Project Blue Book

05:44.094 --> 05:48.849
and its science advisor,
astronomer J. Allen Hynek.

05:48.849 --> 05:52.352
CUTCHIN:
Joe Simonton‐‐ this is an
interesting case because it has

05:52.352 --> 05:55.856
a level of physical evidence
that we don't often see

05:55.856 --> 05:57.232
with a lot of these cases.

05:57.232 --> 05:59.276
LINDA MOULTON HOWE:
NICAP,

05:59.276 --> 06:02.779
the National Investigations
Committee for Aerial Phenomena,

06:02.779 --> 06:06.616
which was largely CIA
back in that period of time,

06:06.616 --> 06:08.201
wants to investigate.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.787
And J. Allen Hynek,
who was doing investigations

06:10.787 --> 06:13.790
for the Air Force,
he wanted to investigate.

06:13.790 --> 06:17.210
NARRATOR:
Hynek obtained samples
of the wafers

06:17.210 --> 06:19.504
and requested
a full analysis by the

06:19.504 --> 06:22.632
U.S. Department of Health's
Food and Drug Laboratory.

06:22.632 --> 06:25.886
The report stated
that the wafers consisted

06:25.886 --> 06:28.638
of chemically modified
terrestrial plants,

06:28.638 --> 06:32.017
including buckwheat,
soybeans, and bran.

06:32.017 --> 06:34.769
But curiously,

06:34.769 --> 06:37.230
not even the tiniest
trace amount of salt

06:37.230 --> 06:39.482
was detected in the sample.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.904
HOWE:
There was no salt at all

06:43.904 --> 06:46.781
found in this analysis

06:46.781 --> 06:51.119
by NICAP and J. Allen Hynek,
and it's puzzling.

06:51.119 --> 06:54.497
MICHAEL DENNIN:
One of the interesting things
about life on this planet

06:54.497 --> 06:57.417
is it did start in the oceans,
and the ocean is salt water.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.919
And so, fundamentally,
the water in our bodies,

06:59.919 --> 07:02.922
in our cells, and in‐in
pretty much every living thing

07:02.922 --> 07:05.342
has a certain amount
of salt concentration

07:05.342 --> 07:06.926
and is ubiquitous everywhere.

07:06.926 --> 07:09.429
NARRATOR:
According to scientists,

07:09.429 --> 07:12.891
every cell of every
living organism on Earth

07:12.891 --> 07:16.936
contains a trace amount
of sodium chloride, or salt.

07:16.936 --> 07:19.648
So could
the complete lack of salt

07:19.648 --> 07:22.692
in Joe Simonton's
so‐called "alien wafer"

07:22.692 --> 07:27.864
really be proof that it came
from an extraterrestrial source?

07:27.864 --> 07:30.617
We see in outer space

07:30.617 --> 07:33.912
thousands of planets with
different kinds of chemistries,

07:33.912 --> 07:37.624
so it's definitely possible that
you can have an entire planet

07:37.624 --> 07:39.709
with very little salt on it.

07:39.709 --> 07:44.297
BIRNES:
What if salt is as poisonous

07:44.297 --> 07:48.718
to those aliens
as cyanide is to us?

07:48.718 --> 07:51.554
That's what that alien contact
could presuppose,

07:51.554 --> 07:55.975
that we've learned something
about what's poisonous to them.

07:55.975 --> 07:59.896
NARRATOR:
Ancient astronaut theorists
suggest that support

07:59.896 --> 08:03.066
for the Joe Simonton story
and the notion that salt

08:03.066 --> 08:05.610
might be poisonous
to some extraterrestrials

08:05.610 --> 08:07.278
that have visited Earth

08:07.278 --> 08:10.907
can be found in ancient tales
from around the world,

08:10.907 --> 08:15.412
in which salt is used
to ward off alien entities.

08:15.412 --> 08:19.499
The salt connection
to the Simonton story

08:19.499 --> 08:22.585
is‐is very interesting because
it connects to other mythologies

08:22.585 --> 08:26.506
involving demonic beings
or fairy beings.

08:26.506 --> 08:30.468
They say that if you pour salt
on the ground

08:30.468 --> 08:32.512
in front of a fairy,
it has to stop automatically.

08:32.512 --> 08:34.389
Or that you can throw salt
over your shoulder

08:34.389 --> 08:36.391
and this will ward off
evil spirits.

08:36.391 --> 08:40.562
The Shinto religion uses salt
as a protective mechanism.

08:40.562 --> 08:44.774
So for salt to be lacking
in these pancakes

08:44.774 --> 08:46.234
is‐is extraordinary

08:46.234 --> 08:49.404
because it‐it links us
to these ancient stories

08:49.404 --> 08:54.075
and it actually confirms
these ancient stories.

08:54.075 --> 08:58.538
NARRATOR:
But if the stories of both
the past and present are true

08:58.538 --> 09:02.542
and these alien visitors
cannot consume salt,

09:02.542 --> 09:04.753
how have they been able
to sustain themselves

09:04.753 --> 09:07.881
in a place where salt
is abundant?

09:07.881 --> 09:11.760
Ancient astronaut theorists
believe that the answer

09:11.760 --> 09:14.554
to this one simple question
may reveal

09:14.554 --> 09:18.141
both an alien agenda on Earth
and perhaps

09:18.141 --> 09:22.187
even the purpose behind
the creation of humankind.

09:29.027 --> 09:32.697
NARRATOR:
The 14th century BC.

09:32.697 --> 09:36.451
According to the Hebrew Bible's
Book of Exodus,

09:36.451 --> 09:39.746
the prophet Moses helps
the Jewish slaves to escape

09:39.746 --> 09:41.790
the tyranny of the pharaoh,

09:41.790 --> 09:46.211
leading them across the Red Sea
and into the Sinai Desert.

09:46.211 --> 09:48.880
During the exodus phase,
you know,

09:48.880 --> 09:51.424
you're wandering in the desert
for almost 40 years.

09:51.424 --> 09:52.634
What do you eat?

09:52.634 --> 09:56.554
Well, God provides
this substance,

09:56.554 --> 09:59.766
this magical substance.

09:59.766 --> 10:03.311
HENRY: Moses appealed to Yahweh,
the Old Testament God,

10:03.311 --> 10:08.108
and Yahweh caused manna,
this food of the heavens,

10:08.108 --> 10:11.194
to rain down
upon the Israelites.

10:11.194 --> 10:15.323
NARRATOR:
But according
to ancient astronaut theorists,

10:15.323 --> 10:17.117
the story of the Israelites

10:17.117 --> 10:21.496
receiving manna from heaven is
not a story about a magical food

10:21.496 --> 10:23.873
being sent by almighty God,

10:23.873 --> 10:28.294
but one of extraterrestrials
using their advanced technology

10:28.294 --> 10:32.632
in order to prevent a group of
migrating humans from starving.

10:32.632 --> 10:36.886
We assumed that we were
looking at gods in the past.

10:36.886 --> 10:41.099
We didn't know we might be
looking at aliens.

10:41.099 --> 10:43.017
(thunder cracks)

10:45.061 --> 10:48.857
NARRATOR:
In 1978, linguist George Sassoon

10:48.857 --> 10:51.568
and electrical engineer
Rodney Dale

10:51.568 --> 10:54.779
released their book,
<i>The Manna Machine.</i>

10:54.779 --> 10:58.324
In it, they propose that
the supplementary Hebrew texts

10:58.324 --> 11:01.369
of the Zohar provide
surprisingly detailed

11:01.369 --> 11:04.664
descriptions that point
to manna being supplied

11:04.664 --> 11:07.041
by a mechanical device.

11:07.041 --> 11:11.629
TSOUKALOS:
We have a concise description of
it in the ancient Jewish texts

11:11.629 --> 11:15.675
of the Zohar, where they
describe the transportable one

11:15.675 --> 11:18.511
with the tanks.

11:18.511 --> 11:21.264
Dale and Sassoon looked
at these stories,

11:21.264 --> 11:24.434
and they came out with the idea
that this is not

11:24.434 --> 11:26.811
a description of God at all;

11:26.811 --> 11:28.771
it's a description of a machine.

11:28.771 --> 11:33.193
The manna machine was this
tower‐like structure,

11:33.193 --> 11:37.071
and it had these two giant tanks
and a dispenser.

11:37.071 --> 11:41.075
Manna is the product
of that machine,

11:41.075 --> 11:44.621
and it is based
on algae cultures.

11:44.621 --> 11:50.335
This manna machine had to be
taken apart every Saturday.

11:50.335 --> 11:55.548
And this was the one day that
the tribe did not have any food.

11:55.548 --> 11:59.010
The basic proposition
by Dale and Sassoon

11:59.010 --> 12:03.181
is that this machine was given
to the Israelites

12:03.181 --> 12:05.892
by extraterrestrials.

12:08.311 --> 12:09.729
NARRATOR:
Could it be
that extraterrestrials

12:09.729 --> 12:13.566
provided technology to the
Israelites to sustain them

12:13.566 --> 12:16.694
during their long journey
through the desert?

12:16.694 --> 12:19.864
For the answer, ancient
astronaut theorists point

12:19.864 --> 12:24.285
to passages describing a pillar
of cloud during the day

12:24.285 --> 12:27.538
and a pillar of fire
guiding them at night.

12:29.290 --> 12:32.669
CHILDRESS: They're following
a light that's guiding them

12:32.669 --> 12:35.922
as they wander for 40 years
through these deserts

12:35.922 --> 12:39.217
of‐of the Sinai
and Northern Saudi Arabia.

12:40.635 --> 12:43.721
So you have to ask yourself,
is it possible

12:43.721 --> 12:47.558
that this pillar of fire
is a UFO

12:47.558 --> 12:51.020
that was working with Moses
to bring the Israelites

12:51.020 --> 12:52.855
to the promised land?

12:52.855 --> 12:56.526
NARRATOR:
If extraterrestrials provided
the Israelites

12:56.526 --> 12:58.695
with a food‐dispensing machine,

12:58.695 --> 13:00.989
is it possible that
they had been using this,

13:00.989 --> 13:05.410
or a similar technology,
to sustain themselves?

13:05.410 --> 13:09.789
Perhaps the same technology
as the one that produced

13:09.789 --> 13:13.501
the mysterious salt‐free wafer
that Joe Simonton claimed

13:13.501 --> 13:17.338
was given to him by aliens
in 1961.

13:19.215 --> 13:22.552
As far as ancient astronaut
theorists are concerned,

13:22.552 --> 13:25.054
the answer lies not
in the further study

13:25.054 --> 13:26.973
of the so‐called manna machine,

13:26.973 --> 13:29.267
but by looking
into other possible

13:29.267 --> 13:32.270
extraterrestrial food sources.

13:33.604 --> 13:35.982
I think there's a definite
connection to be drawn

13:35.982 --> 13:39.610
between a lot
of the food preparation practice

13:39.610 --> 13:42.780
that we see associated with
all sorts of major religions

13:42.780 --> 13:45.658
and the modern UFO phenomena.

13:45.658 --> 13:49.454
If we look back
into ancient religions,

13:49.454 --> 13:51.581
one of the things that we find
time and again,

13:51.581 --> 13:54.125
no matter which part
of the world it is,

13:54.125 --> 13:56.836
is the issue of sacrifice
of animals.

13:59.213 --> 14:02.717
Now, the big question is:
why was this being done?

14:02.717 --> 14:07.013
Well, I think we could make
an interesting scenario if,

14:07.013 --> 14:12.727
for example, the aliens required
specific food and liquid items.

14:12.727 --> 14:15.855
HUSSAIN:
There are all sorts of religions
that have food restrictions.

14:15.855 --> 14:18.149
In the Jewish tradition
we have the word "kosher."

14:18.149 --> 14:19.942
What is acceptable food?

14:19.942 --> 14:22.278
In the Islamic tradition,
halal‐‐ exactly the same thing.

14:22.278 --> 14:24.572
What food is allowed,
what food is acceptable?

14:24.572 --> 14:27.366
And so, for example,
when you kill an animal,

14:27.366 --> 14:29.702
you cut the throat,
you drain the blood.

14:29.702 --> 14:32.580
You want as little blood there
as possible.

14:32.580 --> 14:36.250
CUTCHIN:
The handling and management
of blood

14:36.250 --> 14:40.088
in kosher and halal practice
is especially important

14:40.088 --> 14:43.132
because it is generally
considered reserved for God.

14:43.132 --> 14:46.302
STRIEBER:
I wouldn't be surprised at all
if blood did not play

14:46.302 --> 14:48.096
a big role in their food.

14:48.096 --> 14:52.850
And if people in the past
had seen them consuming blood,

14:52.850 --> 14:57.021
it might have become that
higher beings had the right

14:57.021 --> 14:59.857
to consume the blood,
not human beings.

15:01.400 --> 15:03.653
NARRATOR:
Malheur National Forest.

15:03.653 --> 15:05.321
Harney County, Oregon.

15:05.321 --> 15:08.783
July 30, 2019.

15:08.783 --> 15:12.495
A rancher discovers
the mutilated carcasses

15:12.495 --> 15:15.248
of five of his prized bulls.

15:17.250 --> 15:21.629
At a loss to explain the deaths,
authorities note that

15:21.629 --> 15:24.549
the animals have been
entirely drained of blood.

15:24.549 --> 15:27.385
This is in keeping
with many similar mutilations

15:27.385 --> 15:29.262
reported around the world.

15:31.222 --> 15:34.809
HOWE:
Animals of every type
you can think of,

15:34.809 --> 15:39.105
large and small, have been
bloodlessly mutilated.

15:41.357 --> 15:45.862
Wild animals, deer, elk,
marmots, reindeer,

15:45.862 --> 15:51.617
kangaroos, snakes, all found
bloodlessly mutilated.

15:53.244 --> 15:55.538
BIRNES:
When cows are mutilated,

15:55.538 --> 15:57.623
one of the things we notice
is that they're

15:57.623 --> 16:00.918
completely drained of blood,
exsanguinated.

16:00.918 --> 16:04.714
What could that possibly mean?

16:04.714 --> 16:08.926
NARRATOR:
According to FBI statistics,
the agency has documented

16:08.926 --> 16:12.972
over 10,000 official reports
of similar animal mutilations

16:12.972 --> 16:15.516
over the past half‐century.

16:15.516 --> 16:19.353
Investigative journalist
Linda Moulton Howe began

16:19.353 --> 16:23.232
researching cattle mutilations
in the late 1970s.

16:23.232 --> 16:25.067
When I produced
<i>A Strange Harvest,</i>

16:25.067 --> 16:26.986
about the animal mutilations,

16:26.986 --> 16:30.823
all of it was
a brand‐new landscape for me

16:30.823 --> 16:33.492
as an investigative reporter
and TV producer.

16:33.492 --> 16:37.955
And it led me to people
who were saying

16:37.955 --> 16:41.125
the perpetrators are
creatures from outer space.

16:41.125 --> 16:45.630
And the whole issue of:
what are they?

16:45.630 --> 16:49.008
Do they eat?
Do they drink?

16:49.008 --> 16:51.302
Are they like us? What?

16:51.302 --> 16:53.846
NARRATOR:
During her investigation,

16:53.846 --> 16:57.600
Linda met with a woman from
the Las Cruces, New Mexico area

16:57.600 --> 17:00.019
who claimed to have been
abducted from the scene

17:00.019 --> 17:02.897
and taken aboard a craft.

17:02.897 --> 17:04.899
Once inside the craft,

17:04.899 --> 17:08.027
the woman encountered
extraterrestrial beings.

17:08.027 --> 17:11.989
They led her to a large vat
containing dark liquid

17:11.989 --> 17:15.034
with body parts floating in it.

17:15.034 --> 17:19.121
They're all floating
in this round container,

17:19.121 --> 17:22.708
and something puts in her head,
telepathically,

17:22.708 --> 17:26.045
that it has something to do
with sustenance.

17:26.045 --> 17:29.966
NARRATOR:
Is there something in both
animal and human blood

17:29.966 --> 17:32.718
that is necessary
in order to sustain the life

17:32.718 --> 17:36.681
of extraterrestrials
visiting planet Earth?

17:36.681 --> 17:41.269
And if so, could finding the
answer provide an important key,

17:41.269 --> 17:44.480
not only in our understanding
of alien life

17:44.480 --> 17:49.068
but in our search for a means
of survival on other worlds?

17:49.068 --> 17:53.030
As far as ancient astronaut
theorists are concerned,

17:53.030 --> 17:55.950
the answer might be found
by examining

17:55.950 --> 17:59.328
the strange connection
between human blood...

17:59.328 --> 18:01.956
and immortality.

18:09.046 --> 18:11.674
NARRATOR:
For the ancient Greeks,

18:11.674 --> 18:13.467
this was the home of the gods.

18:13.467 --> 18:16.512
Gods that were very much
like humans,

18:16.512 --> 18:18.931
except that they could
live forever,

18:18.931 --> 18:23.477
courtesy of a mysterious drink
called ambrosia.

18:23.477 --> 18:27.440
HUSSAIN:
Ambrosia was literally
the food of immortality.

18:27.440 --> 18:30.067
In the ancient world,
the gods ate, the gods drank.

18:30.067 --> 18:32.778
And this is what
kept them divine.

18:32.778 --> 18:34.697
This is what kept them
alive forever,

18:34.697 --> 18:36.365
which is one of the crucial
differences between

18:36.365 --> 18:37.783
the divine and the human.

18:39.243 --> 18:42.121
NARRATOR:
While ambrosia was reserved
for the gods,

18:42.121 --> 18:44.957
the ancient Greek texts
also contain stories

18:44.957 --> 18:48.794
of this divine food being shared
with select humans

18:48.794 --> 18:53.132
and extending their life spans
indefinitely.

18:53.132 --> 18:57.637
We might imagine that it is
some sort of a liquid

18:57.637 --> 19:00.931
or, or paste or ointment

19:00.931 --> 19:05.102
that has special properties.

19:05.102 --> 19:10.441
By drinking it, you are
extending your life,

19:10.441 --> 19:15.279
and if you drank this ambrosia
over many, many years,

19:15.279 --> 19:19.367
you could have a certain sense
of immortality, in a way.

19:19.367 --> 19:22.745
NARRATOR:
Substances like ambrosia
can be found

19:22.745 --> 19:25.081
in numerous ancient traditions.

19:25.081 --> 19:29.669
In China there were stories
of the Peaches of Immortality.

19:29.669 --> 19:32.797
The Norse spoke
of I unn's apples.

19:32.797 --> 19:36.050
But as far as ancient astronaut
theorists are concerned,

19:36.050 --> 19:40.012
the ubiquity of this story
also provides further evidence

19:40.012 --> 19:42.390
that ancient peoples
came into contact

19:42.390 --> 19:45.351
with the same
otherworldly beings.

19:45.351 --> 19:48.437
HENRY:
Ancient astronaut theorists
look at the gods

19:48.437 --> 19:52.066
as extraterrestrial beings,
as aliens.

19:52.066 --> 19:54.985
If you're talking
about beings that are

19:54.985 --> 19:57.863
traveling the stars
for generations,

19:57.863 --> 20:00.491
they're going to need
some kind of sustenance

20:00.491 --> 20:03.411
that will sustain them
during these voyages.

20:03.411 --> 20:06.664
And that appears to be
what ambrosia was.

20:06.664 --> 20:11.585
NARRATOR:
Could it be that the ancient
stories about ambrosia

20:11.585 --> 20:14.672
and similar elixirs
were actually descriptions

20:14.672 --> 20:17.466
of a substance
that extraterrestrials used

20:17.466 --> 20:20.219
to facilitate long voyages
through space?

20:20.219 --> 20:24.932
And, if so, was it seen
as a source of immortality,

20:24.932 --> 20:28.144
not only because of its ability
to prolong life

20:28.144 --> 20:31.814
but also because it sustained
alien travelers

20:31.814 --> 20:34.692
during thousands of years
in space?

20:34.692 --> 20:38.112
Perhaps further clues
to the answers can be found

20:38.112 --> 20:41.991
by examining the many accounts
of ancient people

20:41.991 --> 20:45.995
living far longer than the
average life expectancy today.

20:45.995 --> 20:47.955
HUSSAIN: The biblical life spans
are extraordinary.

20:47.955 --> 20:51.125
So the Bible says that Adam
lived for 930 years,

20:51.125 --> 20:53.252
that Noah lived for 950 years.

20:53.252 --> 20:57.089
That Methuselah lived
for 969 years.

20:58.924 --> 21:02.344
It seems like an odd concept,
but you have many records of‐‐

21:02.344 --> 21:04.430
not just in the Bible
but all throughout history‐‐

21:04.430 --> 21:07.266
all these other cultures
also talk about this, you know.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.101
The Sumerian Kings List,

21:09.101 --> 21:13.105
Chinese masters living to 300
years old into the 1700s.

21:13.105 --> 21:17.526
Even ancient Philippine records
talk about these kings

21:17.526 --> 21:19.695
that lived long lives.

21:19.695 --> 21:23.532
It's found all around the world.

21:23.532 --> 21:27.661
Some of the stories that we hear
about this drink, ambrosia,

21:27.661 --> 21:31.499
connect to these journeys
to the celestial realm.

21:31.499 --> 21:35.336
In fact, Enoch actually
describes that before

21:35.336 --> 21:38.547
he was able to go
up to the heavens,

21:38.547 --> 21:41.383
he is actually anointed,

21:41.383 --> 21:44.136
and he says
it smelled like ambrosia.

21:44.136 --> 21:48.307
But the question is,
was he really anointed?

21:48.307 --> 21:52.561
What if ambrosia was something
that you had to take in

21:52.561 --> 21:55.981
in order to prepare
for a journey to outer space,

21:55.981 --> 21:58.818
and it gave you immortality?

22:01.070 --> 22:03.572
NARRATOR:
If ambrosia was
an alien substance

22:03.572 --> 22:07.159
that could both extend life
and facilitate space travel,

22:07.159 --> 22:08.786
just what was it?

22:08.786 --> 22:10.996
Something that could
only be found

22:10.996 --> 22:13.374
or concocted on alien worlds?

22:13.374 --> 22:16.377
Or something that could
be found in abundance

22:16.377 --> 22:18.796
right here on Earth?

Silicon Valley start‐up
Ambrosia LLC

22:36.522 --> 22:39.358
obtains approval
to begin clinical trials

22:39.358 --> 22:42.528
on an experimental treatment
to reverse aging.

22:42.528 --> 22:45.823
Medical researchers
inject older test subjects

22:45.823 --> 22:48.617
with blood plasma
from young donors

22:48.617 --> 22:50.870
in an effort
to improve their health

22:50.870 --> 22:53.372
and extend their life span.

22:53.372 --> 22:56.250
Hundreds of patients
sign up to participate,

22:56.250 --> 23:01.839
paying $8,000 for each liter
of blood plasma they receive.

23:03.465 --> 23:07.386
The theory is,
whether it's true or not,

23:07.386 --> 23:10.347
is that by infusing yourself

23:10.347 --> 23:12.224
with the blood
of younger people,

23:12.224 --> 23:16.687
you will gain a longer life,
because you won't have,

23:16.687 --> 23:20.858
as the commercial used to say,
tired blood or old blood.

23:20.858 --> 23:24.778
You're literally giving yourself
a new lease on life.

23:24.778 --> 23:28.157
NARRATOR:
Ancient Greek texts
connect ambrosia

23:28.157 --> 23:32.411
with divine blood called ichor.

23:32.411 --> 23:34.330
And the concept that blood

23:34.330 --> 23:37.416
can impart immortality
is widespread,

23:37.416 --> 23:40.419
found in legends of vampires

23:40.419 --> 23:45.424
and even historical accounts
of human blood sacrifice.

23:45.424 --> 23:49.970
Is it possible that blood,
and particularly human blood,

23:49.970 --> 23:52.681
has life‐sustaining properties
far beyond

23:52.681 --> 23:55.100
our current understanding?

23:55.100 --> 23:56.769
REDFERN:
When it comes to the issue

23:56.769 --> 24:00.147
of extraterrestrials and blood,
there's one scenario,

24:00.147 --> 24:04.944
the idea that the aliens
may actually take blood.

24:04.944 --> 24:08.864
Now, that's not completely
out of the question.

24:08.864 --> 24:11.158
The main reason being

24:11.158 --> 24:15.788
it contains iron,
proteins, nutrients.

24:15.788 --> 24:20.376
In other words, it'd be
the classic important item

24:20.376 --> 24:23.629
for aliens to dine upon.

24:23.629 --> 24:28.175
But we cannot do that
without causing extreme damage,

24:28.175 --> 24:31.053
possibly even death,
to ourselves.

24:31.053 --> 24:34.473
That sort of suggests,
possibly, also,

24:34.473 --> 24:39.603
that blood is an item of the
extraterrestrials and not of us.

24:39.603 --> 24:43.482
NARRATOR:
Does human blood possess
life‐sustaining properties

24:43.482 --> 24:46.902
far beyond its function
inside the body?

24:46.902 --> 24:50.656
And, if so, could the substance
known as ambrosia

24:50.656 --> 24:53.659
be flowing through
the veins of every human?

24:53.659 --> 24:57.830
As far as many ancient astronaut
theorists are concerned,

24:57.830 --> 25:00.499
the answer is yes,

25:00.499 --> 25:03.335
and they suggest
that this profound notion

25:03.335 --> 25:08.090
was first conveyed to humankind
more than 2,000 years ago

25:08.090 --> 25:11.677
by a man named Jesus.

25:15.139 --> 25:18.267
NARRATOR:

25:28.110 --> 25:32.448
and consecrates the offerings
of bread and wine.

25:32.448 --> 25:34.575
According to Church historians,

25:34.575 --> 25:38.203
the ceremony's roots lie
in the Last Supper Jesus shared

25:38.203 --> 25:39.872
with his disciples

25:39.872 --> 25:43.876
shortly before he sacrificed
his life on the cross.

25:47.087 --> 25:50.174
As he passed the bread, Jesus
said, "Take this and eat it,

25:50.174 --> 25:51.759
it is my body."

25:51.759 --> 25:55.512
And as he passed the wine,
he said, "Drink this,

25:55.512 --> 25:58.265
it is the blood
of the covenant."

25:58.265 --> 26:02.853
And out of that moment at a meal
grew a great ritual, a ceremony,

26:02.853 --> 26:05.606
a sacrament that is repeated
to this day

26:05.606 --> 26:08.275
around the world
by millions of people.

26:08.275 --> 26:10.652
NARRATOR:
In the Roman Catholic tradition,

26:10.652 --> 26:14.448
during the Mass, the priest
is empowered by the prayers

26:14.448 --> 26:16.617
that energize the bread
and the wine

26:16.617 --> 26:18.994
such that they become
transformed,

26:18.994 --> 26:20.913
or transubstantiated,

26:20.913 --> 26:23.582
into the living presence
of the body

26:23.582 --> 26:25.751
and the blood of Christ.

26:27.628 --> 26:30.047
Transubstantiation is one
of the Catholic Church's

26:30.047 --> 26:32.257
most exalted mysteries.

26:32.257 --> 26:35.094
Catholics are encouraged
to believe

26:35.094 --> 26:39.598
that through this miracle,
somehow these ordinary wafers

26:39.598 --> 26:41.683
and ordinary wine

26:41.683 --> 26:45.395
become the blood
and body of Jesus.

26:45.395 --> 26:48.607
NARRATOR:
Could this rite
of turning bread and wine

26:48.607 --> 26:50.651
into the body and blood of Jesus

26:50.651 --> 26:54.029
really have
otherworldly origins?

26:54.029 --> 26:56.406
BIRNES:
Isn't it interesting

26:56.406 --> 26:58.826
that we have numerous traditions
around the globe

26:58.826 --> 27:03.622
telling us that blood is the
substance reserved for the gods?

27:03.622 --> 27:07.292
Now we have to ask, is there
a connection between the ritual

27:07.292 --> 27:11.713
of the Catholic Mass
and extraterrestrials?

27:13.632 --> 27:17.970
Maybe it's possible,
by imbibing certain bloods,

27:17.970 --> 27:20.556
the extraterrestrials
are actually able

27:20.556 --> 27:25.227
to extend their life spans
to incredible degrees.

27:25.227 --> 27:29.690
So, when Jesus talked about
the "blood of the covenant,"

27:29.690 --> 27:33.485
just maybe Jesus was talking
in a symbolic fashion

27:33.485 --> 27:38.282
when he talked about how wine
and bread sustains us

27:38.282 --> 27:42.536
but something very, very
different sustained him.

27:42.536 --> 27:45.539
That the wine that sustains us

27:45.539 --> 27:49.334
is the parallel
of the blood for Jesus.

27:49.334 --> 27:54.172
NARRATOR:
If alien beings have been coming
to Earth for thousands of years,

27:54.172 --> 27:57.175
is it possible that they have
evolved to a point

27:57.175 --> 27:58.927
where they do not
physically consume food

27:58.927 --> 28:03.390
in the way that humans do,
but are able to draw sustenance

28:03.390 --> 28:07.060
from certain energetic
substances, like blood?

28:07.060 --> 28:10.105
And does the ritual of Communion
provide a clue

28:10.105 --> 28:12.858
as to how humankind must evolve

28:12.858 --> 28:16.945
in order to become
like the gods?

28:16.945 --> 28:19.406
When we think of food,
we immediately have that image

28:19.406 --> 28:20.824
of a hamburger, french fries,

28:20.824 --> 28:22.784
and there you are,
munching away.

28:22.784 --> 28:25.245
But I'm a physicist.

28:25.245 --> 28:28.749
We realize that
the essence of food is energy,

28:28.749 --> 28:31.376
and energy can exist
in many, many forms.

28:31.376 --> 28:34.713
So, think of widening
your possibilities.

28:34.713 --> 28:36.715
Any time there's
a source of energy,

28:36.715 --> 28:39.051
there's a possibility
of using it

28:39.051 --> 28:42.137
for food for an alien species.

28:42.137 --> 28:44.640
Myself, I think these things
are really possible,

28:44.640 --> 28:48.310
and maybe there is
something there.

28:48.310 --> 28:51.647
But at the same time,
the story of the Eucharist

28:51.647 --> 28:53.440
being created in the Upper Room

28:53.440 --> 28:57.069
is one of the most profound
and beautiful stories I know.

28:57.069 --> 28:59.947
And I prefer to think of it
that way, personally.

28:59.947 --> 29:02.783
NARRATOR:
For centuries,
theologists have debated

29:02.783 --> 29:05.160
the origin and meaning
of the Eucharist,

29:05.160 --> 29:08.246
but it is not
an entirely unique ritual.

29:08.246 --> 29:12.292
And ancient astronaut theorists
suggest that a similar ceremony

29:12.292 --> 29:14.252
established in ancient India

29:14.252 --> 29:18.882
provides further clues as to
the nature of alien sustenance.

29:18.882 --> 29:22.219
Soma is this huge thing in the,
in the early Indian tradition,

29:22.219 --> 29:23.637
the <i>Rigveda.</i>

29:23.637 --> 29:26.014
The earliest Hindu texts
talk about this.

29:26.014 --> 29:29.977
So soma is this drink that gives
the people who consume it,

29:29.977 --> 29:32.270
you know, the powers of this god

29:32.270 --> 29:35.232
or the thoughts of this god,
the abilities there.

29:35.232 --> 29:38.360
VIEIRA:
Soma was brought to humans
by Agni the fire god.

29:38.360 --> 29:41.863
The same story you have with
the holy wine or the Eucharist.

29:41.863 --> 29:45.784
And it's like somehow we are
being helped by‐by these beings

29:45.784 --> 29:47.661
through these
different substances.

29:47.661 --> 29:49.496
I find that really fascinating.

29:49.496 --> 29:50.998
HENRY:
They have a saying
in the <i>Rigveda</i>

29:50.998 --> 29:53.667
that if you drink soma,

29:53.667 --> 29:56.253
you see God
and you connect with God.

29:56.253 --> 29:58.964
But they also said
it promoted immortality

29:58.964 --> 30:00.799
and longevity as well.

30:02.926 --> 30:07.097
CHILDRESS:
Ancient people are drinking
this special drink of soma,

30:07.097 --> 30:11.101
and they're drinking
the blood of the gods.

30:11.101 --> 30:15.313
And so we look, too,
at the Catholic concept

30:15.313 --> 30:17.566
of transubstantiation,

30:17.566 --> 30:21.319
where the body
and the blood of Christ

30:21.319 --> 30:27.325
are then in these‐these wafers
and‐and wine that we drink.

30:27.325 --> 30:32.122
And you have to wonder if even
that is an, is an old relic

30:32.122 --> 30:36.501
of the early soma rituals.

30:36.501 --> 30:40.297
NARRATOR:
Is there an extraterrestrial
inspiration

30:40.297 --> 30:42.424
behind both the rites
of Communion

30:42.424 --> 30:45.427
and the ancient rites of soma?

30:45.427 --> 30:49.181
Were they intended to teach us
vital lessons about longevity,

30:49.181 --> 30:51.892
and perhaps point the way
to our own future

30:51.892 --> 30:54.144
as a spacefaring people?

30:54.144 --> 30:58.273
And if so,
might there be other stories,

30:58.273 --> 31:02.194
of other food substances humans
were given to eat or drink

31:02.194 --> 31:05.864
that point to an alien agenda
for mankind?

31:17.542 --> 31:20.629
NARRATOR:
During an international
book tour for <i>Communion,</i>

31:20.629 --> 31:23.799
his best‐selling account
of his own alien abduction,

31:23.799 --> 31:25.634
author Whitley Strieber

31:25.634 --> 31:30.222
receives a visit at his hotel
room from a mysterious being.

31:30.222 --> 31:33.183
I had a 45‐minute
conversation with him.

31:33.183 --> 31:37.896
Then he gave me a glass
of liquid to drink.

31:39.898 --> 31:41.858
It was white

31:41.858 --> 31:45.237
and I didn't want to drink it,

31:45.237 --> 31:48.240
but he insisted that I do it.

31:48.240 --> 31:50.575
Somehow or another, I did it.

31:50.575 --> 31:52.577
It was extremely bitter,

31:52.577 --> 31:55.872
and the next thing I knew,
I was waking up in the morning.

31:55.872 --> 31:59.000
I thought maybe it's some kind
of alien potion,

31:59.000 --> 32:02.546
but recently I did
some more research on it

32:02.546 --> 32:05.590
and I found that it's,
it was in the past called

32:05.590 --> 32:07.217
the milk of nepenthe.

32:07.217 --> 32:10.053
It was first mentioned

32:10.053 --> 32:13.598
in the poet Homer's writings,

32:13.598 --> 32:16.893
then it was known
throughout the ancient world.

32:16.893 --> 32:18.770
No one was really sure
what it is,

32:18.770 --> 32:23.441
but the symptoms described are
just like what I experienced.

32:23.441 --> 32:28.655
Nepenthe is something that makes
people forget, as it did me.

32:28.655 --> 32:33.451
NARRATOR:
Homer, the legendary
eighth century BC Greek poet,

32:33.451 --> 32:38.582
mentions nepenthe
in his epic poem <i>The Odyssey.</i>

32:38.582 --> 32:41.126
Plato writes about
a similar substance

32:41.126 --> 32:44.212
in his Book X of <i>The Republic.</i>

32:44.212 --> 32:46.256
The drink was said
to help humans

32:46.256 --> 32:48.133
fall into profound amnesia

32:48.133 --> 32:51.511
and forget the trauma of their
encounters with the gods,

32:51.511 --> 32:55.390
encounters that today
we might call alien abductions.

32:58.727 --> 33:02.022
STRIEBER:
It was also given to people
who had gone to Mount Olympus

33:02.022 --> 33:03.773
and been with the gods,

33:03.773 --> 33:08.069
on their way down, so that they
would forget what they had seen

33:08.069 --> 33:13.491
and they would not want
to commit suicide.

33:13.491 --> 33:17.829
TSOUKALOS:
In Greek mythology, every time
it was given to someone

33:17.829 --> 33:20.665
they would forget
anything that happened to them

33:20.665 --> 33:23.376
in the last 48 hours.

33:23.376 --> 33:27.797
Now, what's interesting
is that modern‐day abductees

33:27.797 --> 33:30.133
talk about the same thing.

33:30.133 --> 33:35.180
So my question is: is it
possible that extraterrestrials

33:35.180 --> 33:39.142
are giving substances to people

33:39.142 --> 33:41.645
in order to forget
what has happened to them?

33:41.645 --> 33:45.690
NARRATOR:
If extraterrestrials have been
using some type of drink

33:45.690 --> 33:49.361
to cloud the memories of humans
they come into contact with,

33:49.361 --> 33:51.279
what is the purpose?

33:51.279 --> 33:55.533
Is it simply to spare them the
trauma of an alien encounter?

33:55.533 --> 34:00.789
Or could it be to hide the fact
that they are extracting blood?

34:00.789 --> 34:04.876
Some ancient astronaut theorists
believe the answer can be found

34:04.876 --> 34:07.212
by examining
the most important moment

34:07.212 --> 34:11.258
of extraterrestrial intervention
in human history.

34:13.343 --> 34:16.721
New York City, 1976.

34:16.721 --> 34:19.683
After spending 30 years
deciphering

34:19.683 --> 34:21.393
the Sumerian language,

34:21.393 --> 34:24.604
researcher Zecharia Sitchin
publishes his book

34:24.604 --> 34:27.065
<i>The 12th Planet.</i>

34:27.065 --> 34:28.775
In it, he proposes

34:28.775 --> 34:32.404
that a race of extraterrestrials
known as the Anunnaki

34:32.404 --> 34:36.241
genetically modified ancient
primates in the distant past,

34:36.241 --> 34:38.910
turning them into modern humans.

34:38.910 --> 34:42.580
In his books, Zecharia Sitchin
dealt at length

34:42.580 --> 34:44.207
with the Sumerian
creation stories,

34:44.207 --> 34:46.001
the Atrahasis
and others that tell

34:46.001 --> 34:51.214
of these beings, the Anunnaki,
putting their image on humanity.

34:53.258 --> 34:56.553
That they genetically altered
a proto‐human

34:56.553 --> 34:59.723
to create a new race of beings,
<i>Homo sapien.</i>

35:01.433 --> 35:03.268
NARRATOR:
According to Sitchin's
translation

35:03.268 --> 35:05.437
of the Sumerian
cuneiform writings,

35:05.437 --> 35:09.065
the Anunnaki produced the first
successful <i>Homo sapiens</i>

35:09.065 --> 35:12.652
around 250,000 BC.

35:12.652 --> 35:16.406
While scholars in the 1970s

35:16.406 --> 35:18.783
dismissed Sitchin's theory,

35:18.783 --> 35:22.954
in the 1980s anthropologists
traced the mitochondrial DNA

35:22.954 --> 35:26.291
of all modern humans
to a common female ancestor

35:26.291 --> 35:30.587
living in Africa
roughly 250,000 years ago.

35:30.587 --> 35:33.882
Geneticists call her
Mitochondrial Eve.

35:36.217 --> 35:38.136
TSOUKALOS:
We were wise,
but now we're even wiser.

35:38.136 --> 35:39.763
Just like that.

35:39.763 --> 35:43.308
And geneticists, to this day,
cannot quite figure out,

35:43.308 --> 35:47.937
well, what was that ping,
that‐that‐that change

35:47.937 --> 35:50.523
that virtually happened
overnight?

35:50.523 --> 35:54.319
So when you have
these weird examples

35:54.319 --> 35:57.781
where stuff essentially
happens overnight,

35:57.781 --> 36:02.202
I'm suggesting this was done
due to an artificial mutation.

36:05.497 --> 36:08.333
NARRATOR:
Researchers following
in Sitchin's footsteps

36:08.333 --> 36:10.794
have noted a largely
overlooked aspect

36:10.794 --> 36:14.214
of the Sumerian cylindrical seal
depicting the celebration

36:14.214 --> 36:17.384
of the first successful
human experiment.

36:17.384 --> 36:20.470
The scene features
a figure stirring a jar

36:20.470 --> 36:22.889
and another holding
a flask directed

36:22.889 --> 36:25.350
at their original creation.

36:25.350 --> 36:29.020
Many associate the scene
with the biblical account

36:29.020 --> 36:32.941
of the temptation
of Adam and Eve.

36:32.941 --> 36:34.359
HENRY:
Adam and Eve,

36:34.359 --> 36:37.987
before their encounter
with this bright snake,

36:37.987 --> 36:39.531
this talking serpent,

36:39.531 --> 36:43.451
who is equated with Enki
in the Sumerian tradition,

36:43.451 --> 36:46.413
this genetic engineer
that came from another world

36:46.413 --> 36:48.665
and altered our human DNA,

36:48.665 --> 36:51.376
that before this event,
Adam and Eve pretty much lived

36:51.376 --> 36:55.255
like primitive
or a primate‐type beings.

36:55.255 --> 36:59.551
NARRATOR:
Could the story of Adam and
Eve's transformation be a memory

36:59.551 --> 37:01.636
of the moment
our genome was altered

37:01.636 --> 37:05.390
by an extraterrestrial race,
as proposed by Sitchin?

37:05.390 --> 37:10.395
And, if so, was that alteration
done by mechanical gene splicing

37:10.395 --> 37:15.358
in a laboratory, as 21st century
technology might do it today?

37:15.358 --> 37:17.736
Or could it have been
accomplished

37:17.736 --> 37:20.739
in a far more sophisticated way,

37:20.739 --> 37:22.949
by simply giving our ancestors

37:22.949 --> 37:25.702
some highly advanced
alien substance,

37:25.702 --> 37:28.913
designed to transform
primates into people?

37:28.913 --> 37:31.666
CHILDRESS:
Here's the story of Adam and Eve

37:31.666 --> 37:35.545
living, uh, sort of blissfully
in this Edenic garden

37:35.545 --> 37:38.381
and just watching the sunset
and having sex

37:38.381 --> 37:40.091
and not doing a whole lot.

37:40.091 --> 37:43.303
And then suddenly this
serpent‐being comes to them

37:43.303 --> 37:47.182
and offers them
some special food to eat.

37:47.182 --> 37:49.267
And they completely change
into what we would call

37:49.267 --> 37:50.810
modern people.

37:50.810 --> 37:54.773
And here we have,
through the intake of food,

37:54.773 --> 37:57.567
we have a fundamental change
and, in a sense,

37:57.567 --> 37:59.944
an evolutionary leap

37:59.944 --> 38:04.574
from primitive humans
to more modern humans

38:04.574 --> 38:08.578
who are more aware of themselves
and their surroundings.

38:08.578 --> 38:12.123
NARRATOR:
Did extraterrestrials
alter life on Earth

38:12.123 --> 38:13.958
to create sentient beings

38:13.958 --> 38:16.753
and then use
amnesia‐inducing substances

38:16.753 --> 38:19.088
in order to keep them
from knowing the facts

38:19.088 --> 38:20.965
behind their alien origins?

38:20.965 --> 38:25.804
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes and suggest

38:25.804 --> 38:29.307
that as humans begin to take
their next evolutionary step

38:29.307 --> 38:30.975
into space,

38:30.975 --> 38:32.977
the veil of ignorance will soon

38:32.977 --> 38:35.480
be removed.

38:41.694 --> 38:44.781
NARRATOR:
220 miles above the Earth.

38:44.781 --> 38:48.159
Researchers on the
International Space Station

38:48.159 --> 38:50.995
are currently testing
an advanced hydroponic system

38:50.995 --> 38:52.831
to make food.

38:52.831 --> 38:57.126
Utilizing artificial light and
a water‐based nutrient solution,

38:57.126 --> 39:00.255
the microalgae contained
within the unit

39:00.255 --> 39:04.384
takes in carbon dioxide
breathed out by the astronauts.

39:04.384 --> 39:07.512
The process allows
the microalgae

39:07.512 --> 39:11.057
to quickly multiply
and produces a continuous supply

39:11.057 --> 39:12.851
of nourishment
on board the craft.

39:14.686 --> 39:19.190
We breathe in oxygen
and we get out carbon dioxide,

39:19.190 --> 39:21.192
but in a hydroponic farm,

39:21.192 --> 39:23.695
you have plants
growing in liquid

39:23.695 --> 39:27.156
and it takes in
the waste products

39:27.156 --> 39:31.744
of human combustion and
expels oxygen as a consequence.

39:31.744 --> 39:35.248
That would give you
a self‐sustaining ecosystem

39:35.248 --> 39:37.792
to maintain the human body.

39:37.792 --> 39:42.422
NASA is experimenting
with hydroponic machines

39:42.422 --> 39:44.507
that enable
the astronauts to grow

39:44.507 --> 39:47.302
a kind of microbiological algae

39:47.302 --> 39:51.347
that is reminiscent of the manna
from the Old Testament.

39:51.347 --> 39:55.518
Could it be that's
our own manna machine?

39:55.518 --> 40:00.273
NARRATOR:
As manned missions to Mars
are within our grasp,

40:00.273 --> 40:03.359
logistical obstacles,
like how to sustain the crew,

40:03.359 --> 40:05.945
must first be overcome.

40:05.945 --> 40:09.949
Could the solution be found not
only by altering the substances

40:09.949 --> 40:11.784
we bring with us into space,

40:11.784 --> 40:14.746
but by altering ourselves?

40:16.080 --> 40:19.834
We can conceive of entirely new
kinds of life‐forms

40:19.834 --> 40:21.836
based on energy.

40:21.836 --> 40:25.548
So food is the energy
that fuels us,

40:25.548 --> 40:28.301
but it's
a real possibility that,

40:28.301 --> 40:31.054
as we start to explore
outer space,

40:31.054 --> 40:34.057
we may have to genetically
modify ourselves

40:34.057 --> 40:36.935
to alter our diet
so that we ingest

40:36.935 --> 40:39.103
different forms of energy.

40:39.103 --> 40:42.941
When we look back at these
unusual foods of the gods,

40:42.941 --> 40:46.819
you have to wonder
if that is not a direction

40:46.819 --> 40:49.072
that we have been meant
to go in,

40:49.072 --> 40:52.742
to become a spacefaring race
ourselves.

40:52.742 --> 40:54.619
So everything has come
full circle here

40:54.619 --> 40:57.872
from ancient times
and these unusual foods

40:57.872 --> 41:02.168
of the gods
to what we're doing today.

41:02.168 --> 41:06.506
REDFERN:
I think this entire
phenomenon of aliens,

41:06.506 --> 41:10.802
of food, of mysterious drinks
is one of the most important

41:10.802 --> 41:14.681
when it comes to us
engaging with them.

41:14.681 --> 41:18.893
And it may well be the case
that that is the primary way

41:18.893 --> 41:20.812
in which we can actually have

41:20.812 --> 41:22.689
some sort of communion
with them.

41:22.689 --> 41:27.402
NARRATOR:
As we evolve
into a spacefaring species,

41:27.402 --> 41:30.238
will the concept
and function of food

41:30.238 --> 41:33.533
take on a new meaning
for humanity?

41:33.533 --> 41:37.161
Perhaps the intriguing evidence
of how aliens may have survived

41:37.161 --> 41:41.165
on Earth will provide
a road map to our own future.

41:41.165 --> 41:44.377
It will open up
new possibilities

41:44.377 --> 41:46.504
and new ways
to sustain ourselves

41:46.504 --> 41:48.715
for much longer time spans.

41:48.715 --> 41:52.260
It will allow us to venture
deeper into space,

41:52.260 --> 41:54.929
colonize new worlds,

41:54.929 --> 41:57.598
and create new versions
of ourselves

41:57.598 --> 42:00.268
as we continue to follow
in the footsteps

42:00.268 --> 42:03.187
of our alien ancestors.
