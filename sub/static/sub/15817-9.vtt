00:36.570 --> 00:37.671

01:00.594 --> 01:01.395

IT'S NOT GOING DOWN.

03:02.816 --> 03:03.484
THE LABEL WANTED

03:03.484 --> 03:04.985
TOO MUCH OF HER MONEY.

03:04.985 --> 03:05.786
AND SINCE HER MONEY

03:05.786 --> 03:06.887
IS MY MONEY,

03:06.887 --> 03:08.389
I COULDN'T EVEN HAVE THAT.

03:08.389 --> 03:09.323
SINCE JOSELINE WANT TO RUN

03:09.323 --> 03:10.258

03:10.258 --> 03:12.125
AND TREAT ME LIKE A PUNK,

03:12.125 --> 03:12.860

03:12.860 --> 03:14.762
I PULLED THE DEAL AS PUNISHMENT

03:14.762 --> 03:15.729

FOR A WHILE.

03:16.930 --> 03:17.598
YOU KNOW WHAT?

03:17.598 --> 03:18.932
MAYBE IF YOU STOPPED CHASING

03:18.932 --> 03:20.601
[bleep] AROUND TOWN,

03:20.601 --> 03:21.702
MAYBE YOU COULD GET MY DEALS

03:21.702 --> 03:22.703
TO GO THROUGH THE CORRECT WAY.

03:22.703 --> 03:23.471
MAYBE YOU CAN MAKE

03:23.471 --> 03:24.438
SOMETHING HAPPEN.

03:24.438 --> 03:25.273
WELL, CONTRARY

03:25.273 --> 03:26.073

03:26.073 --> 03:26.740
I AIN'T CHASING

03:26.740 --> 03:27.641

03:27.641 --> 03:29.610

03:58.105 --> 03:58.772

04:01.141 --> 04:01.975
YOU'RE DAMN [bleep] RIGHT.

04:01.975 --> 04:03.311
YOU'RE DAMN [bleep] SKIPPY.

04:03.311 --> 04:05.579
IF I FIND OUT THAT STEVIE'S

04:05.579 --> 04:07.147

04:08.148 --> 04:09.049
WITH THESE BITCHES,

04:09.049 --> 04:09.950
TRICKING OFF,

04:09.950 --> 04:12.085
THERE'S GONNA BE HELL TO PAY.

04:18.158 --> 04:19.126
I'M ABOUT TO RELEASE

04:19.126 --> 04:20.761
A DISS SONG ON K.MICHELLE.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.863
SHE CALLED ME TO TALK,

04:22.863 --> 04:24.332
SO I'M ASSUMING SHE HEARD ABOUT

04:24.332 --> 04:26.133
IT SOMEWHERE IN THE STREETS.

04:26.133 --> 04:27.668
BUT IF SHE DIDN'T,

04:27.668 --> 04:28.669
I AIN'T GOT NO PROBLEMS

04:28.669 --> 04:30.671
TELLING IT TO HER IN HER FACE.

04:34.342 --> 04:35.576
HI, KARLIE.

04:35.576 --> 04:36.344
HEY.

04:36.344 --> 04:37.445
HOW YOU DOING?

04:37.445 --> 04:39.179

04:40.180 --> 04:41.949
OH, I NEVER THOUGHT I'D BE

04:41.949 --> 04:43.851
SITTING IN FRONT OF YOU.

04:43.851 --> 04:45.453
I KNOW.

04:45.453 --> 04:46.487
CRAZY.

04:46.487 --> 04:48.489
I AM ON DAMAGE CONTROL

04:48.489 --> 04:49.457
RIGHT NOW.

04:49.457 --> 04:51.191
I'M GONNA GO TO THE ONE PERSON

04:51.191 --> 04:53.226

04:53.226 --> 04:54.362
AND THAT IS KARLIE REDD.

04:54.362 --> 04:55.529
IF I CAN GET PAST HER

04:55.529 --> 04:57.030
AND HER DEFLATED ASS CHEEKS,

04:57.030 --> 04:58.799
I CAN MAKE IT PAST ANYTHING.

04:58.799 --> 05:00.534
KARLIE REDD, I DON'T HATE YOU.

05:00.534 --> 05:01.902
I HONESTLY DON'T.

05:01.902 --> 05:04.505
I RESPECT TRUTH AND HONESTY

05:04.505 --> 05:05.373
MORE THAN ANYTHING,

05:05.373 --> 05:06.374
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

05:06.374 --> 05:09.142
YOU WERE SOMEWHAT

05:09.142 --> 05:10.110
COMING FOR ME.

05:10.110 --> 05:11.144
SO IF YOU WERE,

05:11.144 --> 05:12.212
I JUST WANT YOU TO BE

05:12.212 --> 05:13.781
A REAL-ASS BITCH AND SAY,

05:13.781 --> 05:14.848
"THAT'S JUST WHERE I WAS AT."

05:14.848 --> 05:16.249
IT AIN'T NO VIOLENCE.

05:16.249 --> 05:18.251
I'LL SIT ON MY HANDS.

05:18.251 --> 05:19.753
MY HANDS--

05:19.753 --> 05:21.422
I'M SITTING ON MY HANDS.

05:21.422 --> 05:22.390
IT'S KIND OF CRAZY

05:22.390 --> 05:23.391
TALKING TO K.MICHELLE.

05:23.391 --> 05:24.992
SHE'S ACTING NICE RIGHT NOW,

05:24.992 --> 05:26.259
BUT I KNOW SHE'S HAD IT

05:26.259 --> 05:27.160
OUT FOR ME EVER SINCE

05:27.160 --> 05:28.462
WE HAD A PROBLEM OVER A PRODUCER

05:28.462 --> 05:29.830
A YEAR AGO.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.765
I DO HAVE CRAZY WAYS, KARLIE.

05:31.765 --> 05:32.866
LIKE, I PROBABLY--

05:32.866 --> 05:34.535
I'M A LITTLE--

05:34.535 --> 05:35.769
NO, I'M NOT GONNA LIE.

05:35.769 --> 05:37.137
I PROBABLY AM A LITTLE OFF.

05:37.137 --> 05:38.238
I'M VERY EMOTIONAL.

05:38.238 --> 05:39.206
I'M VERY PASSIONATE.

05:39.206 --> 05:40.408
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO TALK

05:40.408 --> 05:41.809
TO PEOPLE ALL THE TIME.

05:41.809 --> 05:43.677
ANY PROBLEM, KARLIE,

05:43.677 --> 05:45.413
GET IT OUT BECAUSE I DON'T WANT

05:45.413 --> 05:46.614
TO FIGHT WITH YOU NO MORE.

05:46.614 --> 05:47.415
I HAVE A CONFESSION

05:47.415 --> 05:49.650
TO MAKE TO YOU.

05:49.650 --> 05:52.019
I MADE A DISS SONG...

05:52.019 --> 05:52.686
OKAY.

05:52.686 --> 05:53.687
BECAUSE I WAS MAD.

05:53.687 --> 05:54.588
OKAY.

05:54.588 --> 05:55.423
IF IT GETS OUT,

05:55.423 --> 05:57.224
JUST KNOW IT WAS NOT--

05:57.224 --> 05:57.891
IT'S COOL.

06:44.037 --> 06:44.838

OF COURSE, YOU KNOW MIMI AND I

06:50.310 --> 06:51.078

06:51.078 --> 06:51.979

06:51.979 --> 06:53.781
FRIENDS DO.

06:53.781 --> 06:54.615
RIGHT, RIGHT.

06:54.615 --> 06:55.749
AND THAT'S MY [bleep].

06:55.749 --> 06:57.350
I LOVE HER TO DEATH.

06:57.350 --> 06:58.552
SHE'S MY [bleep] TOO, THOUGH.

06:58.552 --> 06:59.487
BUT ARE YOU GENUINELY HAPPY

06:59.487 --> 07:00.087
FOR HER?

07:00.087 --> 07:00.821
YES, I AM.

07:00.821 --> 07:01.489
YOU'RE NOT.

07:01.489 --> 07:02.155
YES, I AM.

07:02.155 --> 07:02.823
MY THING IS LIKE...

07:02.823 --> 07:03.491
YOU'RE NOT.

07:03.491 --> 07:04.157
IF SHE'S HAPPY,

07:04.157 --> 07:05.158
THEN I'M HAPPY.

07:05.158 --> 07:06.026
WHEN SHE'S NOT HAPPY,

07:06.026 --> 07:07.495
THAT'S WHEN I'M NOT HAPPY.

07:07.495 --> 07:08.962
BUT SHE'S HAPPY.

07:08.962 --> 07:10.063
SHE'S TOLD ME THAT SHE'S HAPPY

07:10.063 --> 07:11.665
WITH HIM, SO I'M HAPPY FOR HER.

07:11.665 --> 07:13.333
IF THIS DUDE NIKKO IS FOR HER,

07:13.333 --> 07:14.502
THEN I'M HAPPY FOR HER.

07:14.502 --> 07:15.903
BUT I REALLY WANT TO KNOW,

07:15.903 --> 07:16.904
IS SHE REALLY HAPPY?

07:16.904 --> 07:18.539
AND ARIANE'S THE ONLY ONE

07:18.539 --> 07:19.807
WHO KNOWS THE TRUTH.

07:19.807 --> 07:20.574
SO WHY THE [bleep]

07:20.574 --> 07:21.575
ARE YOU HERE?

07:21.575 --> 07:22.242
I GOT TO MAKE SURE

07:22.242 --> 07:23.076
SHE'S GOOD.

07:23.076 --> 07:24.277
THEN CALL HER.

07:24.277 --> 07:24.945
I DID.

07:24.945 --> 07:25.779
AND WHAT HAPPENED?

07:25.779 --> 07:26.514
I WANTED TO SIT WITH YOU

07:26.514 --> 07:27.180
AND LOOK YOU IN YOUR FACE

07:27.180 --> 07:28.015
AND ASK YOU.

07:28.015 --> 07:29.149

07:30.718 --> 07:31.519
YOUR MANIPULATING ASS.

07:31.519 --> 07:32.520

07:32.520 --> 07:33.954
I'M A GOOD DUDE.

07:33.954 --> 07:34.855
WHO TOLD YOU THAT?

07:34.855 --> 07:35.823
SO YOU'RE SAYING

07:35.823 --> 07:37.157
I'M NOT A GOOD GUY?

07:37.157 --> 07:39.226
YOU HURT MY FRIEND.

07:39.226 --> 07:40.794
YOU HURT HER HARD.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.963
SHE GOT SOMEBODY.

07:42.963 --> 07:43.631
NO.

07:43.631 --> 07:44.331
AND SHE'S STILL HURTING.

07:44.331 --> 07:45.699

07:46.534 --> 07:47.200
WELL, SO WHAT?

07:47.200 --> 07:47.868

07:47.868 --> 07:48.536
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

07:48.536 --> 07:49.703
YOU LEFT HER...

07:49.703 --> 07:50.604
I LEFT HER--

07:50.604 --> 07:51.905
FOR A MOTHER[bleep]...

07:51.905 --> 07:53.774
NO, NO, NO, NO.

07:53.774 --> 07:55.008
OUTWARDLY PROSTITUTE.

07:55.008 --> 07:55.676

07:55.676 --> 07:57.545
SHE CAME BACK AND WAS LIKE,

07:57.545 --> 08:00.347
"YO, I'M ROCKING WITH HIM."

08:00.347 --> 08:02.449
I SAID, "OKAY."

08:02.449 --> 08:04.284
AND YOU [bleep] ON HER.

08:04.284 --> 08:05.753

08:16.363 --> 08:17.130
SHE'S NOT REALLY

08:17.130 --> 08:18.031

08:18.031 --> 08:19.099
THIS IS NOT WHAT I WANT TO

08:19.099 --> 08:20.768
HEAR ABOUT MY BABY MAMA.

08:20.768 --> 08:21.735
I THOUGHT SHE WAS HAPPY

08:21.735 --> 08:22.770

08:26.607 --> 08:28.275
SO I NEED TO SET IT STRAIGHT.

YOU'RE [bleep] UP.

08:29.643 --> 08:31.044

08:31.044 --> 08:32.445
I DON'T WANT TO HURT ANYBODY

08:32.445 --> 08:33.681

10:42.710 --> 10:44.577
[laughs]

10:44.577 --> 10:45.813
HE GAVE ME A ROLEX,

10:45.813 --> 10:46.947
BUT IT WAS LIKE A LITTLE,

10:46.947 --> 10:50.818
DAINTY, BABY, BABY ROLEX.

10:50.818 --> 10:51.885
I DON'T LIKE LITTLE, DAINTY--

10:51.885 --> 10:52.720
YOU NEVER SEE ME

10:52.720 --> 10:53.653
WITH ANYTHING DAINTY ON,

10:53.653 --> 10:54.955
AS YOU CAN SEE.

10:54.955 --> 10:56.790
I LIKE BIG, CHUNKY [bleep].

10:56.790 --> 10:58.158
I PICKED THIS.

10:58.158 --> 10:58.926

10:58.926 --> 11:00.493
WITHOUT DIAMONDS FOR YOU.

11:00.493 --> 11:01.895
YOU LIKE IT BETTER

11:01.895 --> 11:03.731

11:03.731 --> 11:05.733
BUT YOURS SHOULD HAVE DIAMONDS.

11:05.733 --> 11:06.333

11:06.333 --> 11:07.100
I'LL PUT DIAMONDS ON IT.

11:07.100 --> 11:08.736
I'LL PUT A BEZEL ON IT.

11:08.736 --> 11:10.170

11:12.172 --> 11:12.873
I APPRECIATE HIM

11:12.873 --> 11:13.573
GETTING ME THE WATCH.

11:13.573 --> 11:14.507
A ROLEX, YOU KNOW,

11:14.507 --> 11:15.175
IS THOUGHTFUL,

11:15.175 --> 11:16.643
BUT IT WASN'T MY STYLE.

11:16.643 --> 11:18.111
AND I THINK HE KIND OF

11:18.111 --> 11:19.446
KNEW IT TOO.

11:19.446 --> 11:20.447
HE SHOULD'VE FOUND OUT

11:20.447 --> 11:21.982
WHAT I LIKED BEFORE HE WENT

11:21.982 --> 11:24.484
AND MADE A PURCHASE LIKE THAT.

11:24.484 --> 11:25.552
YOU KNOW, I GOT THE VIDEO

11:25.552 --> 11:26.586

11:26.586 --> 11:27.755
OKAY.

11:29.422 --> 11:31.959
WELL, I SAW THE ROUGH CUT.

11:31.959 --> 11:32.625
YEAH, BUT YOU DIDN'T

11:32.625 --> 11:33.393
SEE THE FINAL.

11:33.393 --> 11:34.194
YOU SHOULDN'T EVEN HAVE SEEN

11:34.194 --> 11:34.862
THE FIRST CUT.

11:34.862 --> 11:35.628
I JUST ALLOWED YOU TO SEE IT.

11:35.628 --> 11:36.496
WELL, I DID.

11:36.496 --> 11:37.998
AND THE FACT THAT I DID

11:37.998 --> 11:39.532
PISSED ME THE [bleep] OFF.

11:39.532 --> 11:40.934
NIKKO SENDS ME THE LINK

11:40.934 --> 11:42.435
TO THE VIDEO THAT I'M SUPPOSED

11:42.435 --> 11:43.771

11:43.771 --> 11:46.206
AND I'M BARELY IN IT.

11:46.206 --> 11:48.341
I FIXED IT, SO WHEN YOU SEE

11:48.341 --> 11:50.778
IT NOW, YOU'RE GONNA LIKE IT.

11:50.778 --> 11:52.312
OKAY.

11:52.312 --> 11:54.081
BUT WHY ARE YOU SO ANGRY?

11:54.081 --> 11:54.882
I'M NOT ANGRY.

11:54.882 --> 11:56.116
IT JUST IS WHAT IT IS.

11:56.116 --> 11:57.084
I'M NOT ANGRY.

11:57.084 --> 11:58.318
IN TERMS OF US BUILDING,

11:58.318 --> 11:59.787
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?

11:59.787 --> 12:01.221
DO YOU WANT SOMEBODY

12:01.221 --> 12:03.223
THAT'S WILLING TO CHANGE

12:03.223 --> 12:04.892
YOUR VIEWS ON WHAT YOU'VE BEEN

12:04.892 --> 12:06.226
FACED WITH IN THE PAST?

12:06.226 --> 12:07.160
YOU CAN'T CHANGE MY VIEWS.

12:07.160 --> 12:09.797
ONLY I CAN CHANGE MY VIEWS.

12:09.797 --> 12:11.498
RIGHT, BUT I CAN HELP.

12:11.498 --> 12:12.532
NO, YOU CAN'T.

12:12.532 --> 12:13.200
YOU LEAVE THE PAST

12:13.200 --> 12:13.867
IN THE PAST.

12:13.867 --> 12:16.403
YOU HAVE TO LET GO OF THE ANGER.

12:16.403 --> 12:17.237
I'M NOT ANGRY.

12:17.237 --> 12:18.806
EVERYBODY THINKS I'M ANGRY.

12:18.806 --> 12:21.441
I'M A VERY HAPPY KIND OF BITCH.

12:37.557 --> 12:39.226
HEY!

12:39.226 --> 12:40.660
HOW YOU DOING?

12:40.660 --> 12:41.528
MWAH.

12:41.528 --> 12:42.863
I HAD TO CALL MY MOM UP

12:42.863 --> 12:43.864
TO TALK TO HER ABOUT WHAT'S

12:43.864 --> 12:45.665
GOING ON WITH ME AND KIRK.

12:45.665 --> 12:46.900
KIRK IS HER BOO.

12:46.900 --> 12:47.634
THAT'S HER BOY.

12:47.634 --> 12:49.069
HE CAN'T DO NO WRONG.

12:49.069 --> 12:50.570
BUT, HONEY, I THINK MOM

12:50.570 --> 12:51.704
IS GONNA HAVE A DIFFERENT

12:51.704 --> 12:52.840
PERSPECTIVE OF THAT

12:52.840 --> 12:53.841
ONCE SHE FINDS OUT

12:53.841 --> 12:54.741
WHAT THE HELL HE BEEN SAYING

12:54.741 --> 12:55.843
TO HIS WIFE AND HOW HE'S BEEN

12:55.843 --> 12:56.476
TREATING ME.

12:56.476 --> 12:58.045
GIRL, WE GOT A LOT

12:58.045 --> 12:59.346
OF CATCHING UP TO DO.

12:59.346 --> 13:00.013
I KNOW IT.

13:00.013 --> 13:01.714
WE HAVEN'T TALKED IN SO LONG.

13:01.714 --> 13:02.850
YOU KNOW, I'MA BE REAL.

13:02.850 --> 13:03.516
I'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH

13:03.516 --> 13:04.317
A WHOLE LOT.

13:04.317 --> 13:06.753
OH, LIKE WHAT, FOR INSTANCE?

13:06.753 --> 13:07.988
KIRK--HE TOLD ME

13:07.988 --> 13:10.490
HE WANT SPACE.

13:10.490 --> 13:12.525
HE DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA

13:12.525 --> 13:13.293
TO HAVE A BABY.

13:13.293 --> 13:14.394
I MIGHT NEED TO THINK ABOUT IT.

13:14.394 --> 13:16.429
BASICALLY TOLD ME

13:16.429 --> 13:18.298
I SHOULD GET AN ABORTION.

13:18.298 --> 13:18.999
OH, MY GOD.

13:18.999 --> 13:21.034
THAT IS A BIG, BIG, BIG PROBLEM.

13:21.034 --> 13:21.869
I'M SITTING HERE THINKING,

13:21.869 --> 13:23.503
"MY HUSBAND GONNA HOLD ME DOWN."

13:23.503 --> 13:25.005
IT WASN'T EVEN A THOUGHT FOR ME

13:25.005 --> 13:25.906
TO THINK THAT IT WASN'T

13:25.906 --> 13:26.739
GONNA BE THAT WAY.

13:26.739 --> 13:28.575
HE HAD ENOUGH NERVE TO SAY TO

13:28.575 --> 13:30.477
ME, "WE MIGHT NEED TO GET

13:30.477 --> 13:32.179
A BLOOD TEST BECAUSE I WORE

13:32.179 --> 13:33.413
CONDOMS WHEN YOU STOPPED

13:33.413 --> 13:34.247
TAKING YOUR PILLS,

13:34.247 --> 13:35.983
AND I WAS PULLING OUT."

13:35.983 --> 13:37.017
I CANNOT BELIEVE

13:37.017 --> 13:38.618
THAT THAT'S KIRK.

13:38.618 --> 13:39.786
SOMETHING'S GOING ON.

13:39.786 --> 13:40.954
SOMETHING'S WRONG

13:40.954 --> 13:41.754
WITH THIS PICTURE.

13:41.754 --> 13:42.755
HE MIGHT NOT COME HOME

13:42.755 --> 13:44.191
TILL 2:30, 3:00 IN THE MORNING.

13:44.191 --> 13:45.492
OH, HELL NO.

13:45.492 --> 13:46.426
WAIT A MINUTE.

13:46.426 --> 13:47.760
WHO HAS HE BEEN AROUND?

13:47.760 --> 13:48.461
I DON'T KNOW.

13:48.461 --> 13:49.529
'CAUSE IT LOOK LIKE TO ME

13:49.529 --> 13:50.497
HE'S KEEPING COMPANY

13:50.497 --> 13:51.698
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

13:51.698 --> 13:52.465
DON'T THINK IT AIN'T

13:52.465 --> 13:53.333
CROSSED MY MIND,

13:53.333 --> 13:54.667
'CAUSE I'M LIKE, "WHOEVER IT IS,

13:54.667 --> 13:55.535
SHE MUST GOT SUNSHINE

13:55.535 --> 13:56.236
FOR KOOTCHIE,

13:56.236 --> 13:57.938
'CAUSE HE GOING CRAZY."

13:57.938 --> 13:59.006
HAS HE CHANGED ABOUT YOU

13:59.006 --> 14:00.207
LOOKING IN HIS PHONE?

14:00.207 --> 14:00.941
YEAH.

14:00.941 --> 14:01.608
I MEAN, I LOOKED ANYWAY.

14:01.608 --> 14:02.309
[bleep] IT.

14:02.309 --> 14:03.043
I DON'T CARE.

14:03.043 --> 14:04.577
HE'S GOT TO GO TO THE BATHROOM

14:04.577 --> 14:05.612
OR FINALLY GO TO SLEEP.

14:05.612 --> 14:06.346
I'M GONNA LOOK.

14:06.346 --> 14:07.214
RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.

14:07.214 --> 14:08.015
DON'T PLAY WITH ME.

14:08.015 --> 14:09.917
I WENT LOOKING TO SEE

14:09.917 --> 14:10.918
IF KIRK WAS CHEATING,

14:10.918 --> 14:12.219
AND I DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING,

14:12.219 --> 14:13.786
WHICH WAS A SIGH OF RELIEF.

14:13.786 --> 14:14.922
AND AT THE SAME TIME,

14:14.922 --> 14:15.822
I'M NOT GONNA GO ACCUSING

14:15.822 --> 14:16.957
SOMEBODY BECAUSE I AIN'T

14:16.957 --> 14:17.790
FIXIN' TO SPEAK THAT [bleep]

14:17.790 --> 14:19.092
INTO EXISTENCE NEITHER.

14:19.092 --> 14:21.128
WE IN A FREAKING MARRIAGE.

14:21.128 --> 14:21.828
YOU OWE ME THAT.

14:21.828 --> 14:22.695
EITHER TELL ME WHAT THE HELL

14:22.695 --> 14:23.663
IS WRONG WITH YOU

14:23.663 --> 14:25.232
OR GET YOUR ASS OUT.

14:25.232 --> 14:26.166
THERE IS SERIOUSLY

14:26.166 --> 14:26.833
SOMETHING WRONG

14:26.833 --> 14:27.767
WITH THIS PICTURE.

14:27.767 --> 14:30.103
I WANT TO SEE HIM IN PERSON.

14:50.790 --> 14:52.492
WHAT'S GOING ON, MAN?

14:52.492 --> 14:53.493
WHAT'S GOING ON?

14:53.493 --> 14:54.227
YOU KNOW, WHEN BROTHERS

14:54.227 --> 14:55.695
ARGUE, YOU KNOW, WE TEND TO SAY

14:55.695 --> 14:57.164
WE'LL NEVER SPEAK TO YOU AGAIN.

14:57.164 --> 14:57.864
BUT, YOU KNOW, WE ALWAYS

14:57.864 --> 14:58.631
COME BACK AROUND.

14:58.631 --> 14:59.866
YOU KNOW, FAMILY FIRST.

14:59.866 --> 15:01.234
SO I FIGURE IT'S TIME

15:01.234 --> 15:02.469
TO SQUASH THE BEEF,

15:02.469 --> 15:03.803
GO GET A COUPLE CIGARS,

15:03.803 --> 15:05.605
AND TALK LIKE TWO BOSSES.

15:05.605 --> 15:06.974
LAST TIME WE SAW EACH OTHER,

15:06.974 --> 15:08.275
THE BLOWOUT WAS CRAZY,

15:08.275 --> 15:09.009
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

15:09.009 --> 15:09.776
AND YOU KNOW ME.

15:09.776 --> 15:11.544
I'M NOT GONNA JUST LET THAT GO.

15:11.544 --> 15:12.279
I HAD TO DO A LITTLE

15:12.279 --> 15:13.480
INVESTIGATION, YOU KNOW?

15:13.480 --> 15:14.147
RIGHT, I UNDERSTAND.

15:14.147 --> 15:16.616
SO I HAD TO GO SEE KARLIE

15:16.616 --> 15:17.617
AGAIN, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

15:17.617 --> 15:18.285
UGH.

15:18.285 --> 15:19.152
AND YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING,

15:19.152 --> 15:20.020
WHAT I FOUND OUT,

15:20.020 --> 15:20.988
WHAT I ALREADY KNEW.

15:20.988 --> 15:23.156
RIGHT, RIGHT.

15:23.156 --> 15:24.224
SHE'S A LIAR,

15:24.224 --> 15:25.158
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

15:25.158 --> 15:25.858
A MANIPULATOR.

15:25.858 --> 15:27.794
LISTEN, IN JOSELINE'S CASE,

15:27.794 --> 15:28.461
I DIDN'T EVEN MEAN

15:28.461 --> 15:29.262
TO SAY THAT TO HER.

15:29.262 --> 15:30.063
AND IF I SEEN HER,

15:30.063 --> 15:30.797
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING,

15:30.797 --> 15:31.898
I WOULD APOLOGIZE TO HER,

15:31.898 --> 15:32.565
BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY

15:32.565 --> 15:33.366
I SHOULD'VE BEEN--

15:33.366 --> 15:34.267
I SHOULD'VE HOLLERED LIKE THAT.

15:34.267 --> 15:35.268
BEFORE YOU GO THERE,

15:35.268 --> 15:36.469
YOU KNOW, WE AIN'T EVEN

15:36.469 --> 15:38.138
ROCKING LIKE THAT RIGHT NOW,

15:38.138 --> 15:39.072
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

15:39.072 --> 15:40.440
ONE DAY, THEY'RE GOOD.

15:40.440 --> 15:41.474
THE NEXT DAY, THEY'RE NOT.

15:41.474 --> 15:42.809
ONE DAY, HE LOVES HER.

15:42.809 --> 15:44.211
THE NEXT DAY,

15:44.211 --> 15:45.112
HE CAN'T STAND HER.

15:45.112 --> 15:45.812
DON'T GET ME WRONG.

15:45.812 --> 15:47.447
PEOPLE ARGUE, BUT THAT,

15:47.447 --> 15:48.315
LIKE I SAID BEFORE,

15:48.315 --> 15:49.082
IS A PLANE CRASH

15:49.082 --> 15:49.916
WAITING TO HAPPEN.

15:49.916 --> 15:51.918
I'M ABOUT TO DO SOMETHING

15:51.918 --> 15:53.320
FOR MIMI.

15:53.320 --> 15:54.687
WHAT'S UP WITH THIS DUDE?

15:54.687 --> 15:55.355
IS HE ALL COOL?

15:55.355 --> 15:56.023
I DON'T REALLY

15:56.023 --> 15:56.689
SEE NONE OF THAT.

15:56.689 --> 15:57.590
SHE GOT MY DAUGHTER,

15:57.590 --> 15:58.258
SO I GOT TO MAKE SURE

15:58.258 --> 15:59.092
HER HEART AND HER MIND

15:59.092 --> 16:00.060
AND EVERYTHING IS RIGHT TOO,

16:00.060 --> 16:00.760
YOU FEEL ME?

16:00.760 --> 16:03.030
'CAUSE I HURT HER.

16:03.030 --> 16:05.232
LOOK AT WHAT I DO,

16:05.232 --> 16:06.033
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

16:06.033 --> 16:06.833
SO I'D BE A FOOL TO THINK

16:06.833 --> 16:07.634
THAT SHE WAS JUST GONNA

16:07.634 --> 16:08.368
SIT AROUND--

16:08.368 --> 16:09.236
LOOK, I MEAN--

16:09.236 --> 16:10.903
LISTEN, MY OPINION:

16:10.903 --> 16:11.571
YOU COULD HAVE HER BACK

16:11.571 --> 16:12.639
ANYTIME YOU WANT TO,

16:12.639 --> 16:14.641
AND DUDE WILL JUST BE LEFT--

16:14.641 --> 16:16.043
HE BE LEFT IN THE COLD,

16:16.043 --> 16:16.743
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

16:16.743 --> 16:18.578
LIKE, ANYTIME YOU WANT

16:18.578 --> 16:20.613
TO MAKE THAT MOVE,

16:20.613 --> 16:21.314
THAT'S THAT.

16:21.314 --> 16:22.082
I ALREADY KNOW IT.

16:22.082 --> 16:22.849
I'M NOT THE TYPE

16:22.849 --> 16:23.516
TO HOLD GRUDGES

16:23.516 --> 16:24.184
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

16:24.184 --> 16:25.485
I JUST--IT'S NOT IN ME.

16:25.485 --> 16:26.386
HE'S A GREAT DUDE

16:26.386 --> 16:28.221
WHEN HE'S NOT GOING CRAZY

16:28.221 --> 16:29.322
OVER FEMALES.

16:29.322 --> 16:30.457
IT WAS DEFINITELY GOOD TO SEE

16:30.457 --> 16:31.124
SLEAZE, THOUGH,

16:31.124 --> 16:31.858
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

16:31.858 --> 16:32.525
COME ON.

16:32.525 --> 16:33.193
YOU KNOW HOW WE DO IT.

16:33.193 --> 16:33.893
THE AVENGERS,

16:33.893 --> 16:34.827
IRON MAN AND HULK,

16:34.827 --> 16:35.628
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

16:35.628 --> 16:36.729
WHEN WE COME TOGETHER, MAN,

16:36.729 --> 16:38.265
WE DO AMAZING THINGS.

16:38.265 --> 16:39.066
ENOUGH ABOUT THAT.

16:39.066 --> 16:39.799
WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON

16:39.799 --> 16:41.434
IN YOUR WORLD?

16:41.434 --> 16:42.102
MAN, I'M TIRED

16:42.102 --> 16:42.769
OF BEING SINGLE.

16:42.769 --> 16:43.603
I'M LOOKING, BUT IT'S LIKE,

16:43.603 --> 16:44.637
I DON'T HAVE THE PATIENCE

16:44.637 --> 16:45.772
WHEN I SEE--IT'S LIKE I'M SCARED

16:45.772 --> 16:46.539
EVERY TIME I SEE

16:46.539 --> 16:48.141
SOME LITTLE BULL[bleep].

16:48.141 --> 16:49.076
THIS IS WHAT I WANT:

16:49.076 --> 16:51.544
A WOMAN THAT WORKS,

16:51.544 --> 16:52.645
HAS HER OWN MONEY

16:52.645 --> 16:53.913
AND HER OWN BUSINESS,

16:53.913 --> 16:55.515
IS BEAUTIFUL,

16:55.515 --> 16:56.416
THAT HAS A LITTLE BIT

16:56.416 --> 16:57.184
OF CLASSINESS

16:57.184 --> 16:58.085
BUT STILL KNOWS HOW

16:58.085 --> 16:59.419
TO GET A LITTLE BIT OF STREET,

16:59.419 --> 17:01.188
THAT'S DEFINITELY A SUPERFREAK.

17:01.188 --> 17:02.455
I AIN'T GONNA LIE, LIKE...

17:02.455 --> 17:03.756
I SEE THAT LOOK IN YOUR EYES.

17:03.756 --> 17:06.126
YOU GOT THAT--OH, THE THIRST IS

17:06.126 --> 17:07.294
REAL, BABY.

17:07.294 --> 17:08.261
SUPER THIRST.

17:08.261 --> 17:10.197
[laughter]

17:10.197 --> 17:13.266
BROS OVER HOS.

17:13.266 --> 17:15.102
I'LL TOAST TO THAT.

17:15.102 --> 17:17.370
I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTAND

17:17.370 --> 17:19.606
WHAT YOU DID.

17:19.606 --> 17:21.341
I APOLOGIZE.

17:21.341 --> 17:22.008
FOR WHAT?

17:22.008 --> 17:23.476
FOR HURTING YOU.

17:23.476 --> 17:25.212
THAT'S IT?

17:25.212 --> 17:25.945
GUESS WHAT.

17:25.945 --> 17:26.613
I'M A REAL BITCH,

17:26.613 --> 17:27.314
AND I'MA KEEP IT REAL.

17:27.314 --> 17:28.281
I'LL TAKE OFF MY SHOES,

17:28.281 --> 17:29.849
JUMP A GATE, AND KILL A BITCH.

17:29.849 --> 17:32.719
AND I'MA ALWAYS BE THAT GIRL.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.721
KARLIE, SIT DOWN!

17:47.434 --> 17:48.135
HEY.

17:48.135 --> 17:49.336
I'VE BEEN MOVING FORWARD

17:49.336 --> 17:50.036
AND FEELING GOOD

17:50.036 --> 17:51.504
ABOUT MY LIFE, IN GENERAL.

17:51.504 --> 17:52.505
STEVIE AND I DO HAVE

17:52.505 --> 17:53.940
A BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER TOGETHER,

17:53.940 --> 17:55.308
SO WE DO HAVE TO REMAIN

17:55.308 --> 17:56.809
COOL AND COMMUNICATE.

17:56.809 --> 17:58.178
YOU GOT A LITTLE TATTOO?

17:58.178 --> 18:00.613
YES, I DID.

18:00.613 --> 18:02.615
LET ME SEE.

18:02.615 --> 18:04.717
OH, WHOA.

18:04.717 --> 18:08.188
WHOA.

18:08.188 --> 18:10.223
THAT'S HARD, MAN.

18:10.223 --> 18:12.192
WHAT INSPIRED THAT JOINT?

18:12.192 --> 18:14.161
I WANTED SOMETHING NEW.

18:14.161 --> 18:14.961
I DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE TO LOOK

18:14.961 --> 18:15.628
DOWN AT MY ARM

18:15.628 --> 18:16.329
AND THINK ABOUT YOU

18:16.329 --> 18:17.564
EVERY [bleep] DAY.

18:17.564 --> 18:18.298
OKAY.

18:18.298 --> 18:21.168
SO I COVERED IT UP.

18:21.168 --> 18:23.170
I PUT MY DAUGHTER'S NAME ON IT.

18:23.170 --> 18:25.004
I JUST DIDN'T WANT THAT HURT.

18:25.004 --> 18:25.938
LIKE, I DON'T THINK YOU

18:25.938 --> 18:30.743
UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU DID.

18:30.743 --> 18:31.511
ALTHOUGH I'M NOT ROCKING

18:31.511 --> 18:33.012
WITH JOSELINE RIGHT NOW,

18:33.012 --> 18:34.214
ARIANE'S TELLING ME MIMI'S

18:34.214 --> 18:35.282
STILL HURT ABOUT ME AND HER

18:35.282 --> 18:36.516
NOT BEING TOGETHER.

18:36.516 --> 18:37.417
MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING I COULD

18:37.417 --> 18:38.685
DO TO MAKE IT RIGHT.

18:38.685 --> 18:40.420
I APOLOGIZE.

18:40.420 --> 18:41.321
FOR WHAT?

18:41.321 --> 18:42.555
FOR HURTING YOU.

18:42.555 --> 18:43.256
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

18:43.256 --> 18:44.224
I GET IT.

18:44.224 --> 18:45.358
WHAT IS IT THAT YOU GET?

18:45.358 --> 18:47.026
I GET THE PAIN THAT YOU FELT.

18:47.026 --> 18:48.528
I KNOW I HURT YOU.

18:48.528 --> 18:50.062
AND, YOU KNOW--AND THAT'S WHAT

18:50.062 --> 18:51.964
INSPIRED YOU TO MOVE ON.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.200
THAT'S IT?

18:53.200 --> 18:54.567
"ACCEPT MY APOLOGY"?

18:54.567 --> 18:56.068
NO, I DIDN'T ASK YOU TO.

18:56.068 --> 18:57.069
I SAID I WAS SORRY.

18:57.069 --> 18:57.904
AND I KNOW YOU PROBABLY

18:57.904 --> 19:00.006
WON'T RIGHT NOW,

19:00.006 --> 19:02.074
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

19:04.477 --> 19:07.914
OH, BABE.

19:07.914 --> 19:09.916
COME ON.

19:11.384 --> 19:13.085
COME ON, MOMMY, PLEASE.

19:13.085 --> 19:13.986
I WANT TO BE STRONG

19:13.986 --> 19:14.954
WHEN I SPEAK TO STEVIE.

19:14.954 --> 19:15.755
BUT THERE'S STILL A LOT

19:15.755 --> 19:17.590
OF UNRESOLVED PAIN AND HURT

19:17.590 --> 19:18.925
FROM ALL OF HIS BETRAYALS,

19:18.925 --> 19:19.992
DESPITE THE FACT

19:19.992 --> 19:21.228
THAT WE'RE NOT TOGETHER.

19:21.228 --> 19:22.094
WOULD YOU STAY WITH ME

19:22.094 --> 19:23.763
IF I WAS PUBLICLY DATING SOMEONE

19:23.763 --> 19:25.598
FOR A [bleep] YEAR?

19:25.598 --> 19:26.433
I GOT IT.

19:26.433 --> 19:27.099
I GET IT.

19:27.099 --> 19:27.800
I GOT IT.

19:27.800 --> 19:29.936
I WAS THE [bleep].

19:29.936 --> 19:30.670
NO, NOT REALLY.

19:30.670 --> 19:31.371
YEAH, REALLY.

19:31.371 --> 19:32.071
NO, NO, NO, NO.

19:32.071 --> 19:33.240
YEAH, I WAS.

19:33.240 --> 19:33.873
NO, NO.

19:33.873 --> 19:34.641
LET ME JUST SAY,

19:34.641 --> 19:36.609
I WAS THE [bleep].

19:36.609 --> 19:37.577
AND I WAS THE [bleep]

19:37.577 --> 19:38.611
FOR STAYING.

19:38.611 --> 19:40.613
CASE CLOSED.

19:42.749 --> 19:45.918
I'M GONNA GET YOU SOMETHING.

19:45.918 --> 19:46.919
YOU KNOW I'M KIND OF LOOKING

19:46.919 --> 19:48.054
AT YOU LIKE...

19:48.054 --> 19:48.721
YOU GOT TO MAKE SURE

19:48.721 --> 19:49.689
EVA GETS FROM POINT "A"

19:49.689 --> 19:50.823
TO POINT "B."

19:50.823 --> 19:51.491
YOU GOT TO GET TO

19:51.491 --> 19:52.425
WHERE YOU GOT TO GO,

19:52.425 --> 19:53.125
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

19:53.125 --> 19:53.926
YOU GOT TO BE LOOKING RIGHT

19:53.926 --> 19:55.295
IN THESE STREETS.

19:55.295 --> 19:56.363
YOU WANT TO GIVE ME A CAR.

19:56.363 --> 19:57.163
YEAH.

19:57.163 --> 19:58.265
DON'T THINK THAT YOU CAN

19:58.265 --> 20:00.267
GIVE ME SOME MATERIAL [bleep]

20:00.267 --> 20:01.968
TO MAKE UP FOR WHAT YOU DID.

20:01.968 --> 20:03.703
IT CAN'T BE ANYTHING CLOSE--

20:03.703 --> 20:06.005
NO, NOPE.

20:06.005 --> 20:07.139
WELL, IT'S STILL GONNA GET

20:07.139 --> 20:08.074
DONE, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

20:08.074 --> 20:09.909
AND I JUST WANT YOU TO HAVE IT.

20:09.909 --> 20:11.244
I WANT YOU TO HAVE

20:11.244 --> 20:11.911
SOMETHING NEW.

20:11.911 --> 20:13.446
YOU WANT SOMETHING NEW?

20:13.446 --> 20:17.049
I WOULD LOVE SOMETHING NEW.

20:17.049 --> 20:18.651

20:18.651 --> 20:20.820
THAT'S WHAT'S UP.

20:46.313 --> 20:48.147

21:38.264 --> 21:40.099
WAIT, THEY'RE HERE TOGETHER?

21:40.099 --> 21:42.101
I INVITED EVERYBODY.

21:42.101 --> 21:42.869
ALL THE WOMEN

21:42.869 --> 21:43.636
WERE LOOKING BEAUTIFUL.

21:43.636 --> 21:44.937
AND KARLIE.

21:44.937 --> 21:47.374
BUT K.MICHELLE, BOY,

21:47.374 --> 21:48.575
SHE WAS THE BIRTHDAY CAKE.

21:48.575 --> 21:49.241
[chuckles]

21:49.241 --> 21:50.209
TRUST ME.

21:50.209 --> 21:51.744
IT'S MY BIRTHDAY, EVERYBODY.

21:51.744 --> 21:52.912
THIS IS THE DAY THAT JESUS

OKAY.

21:56.048 --> 21:56.716

21:56.716 --> 21:57.384
BENZINO BROUGHT YOU

21:57.384 --> 21:58.050
SOMETHING, RIGHT?

21:58.050 --> 21:58.818
I GAVE IT TO HER.

21:58.818 --> 22:01.053
OOH, [bleep].

22:01.053 --> 22:04.391
WHAT YOU GOT THERE?

22:04.391 --> 22:05.658
OH, THIS IS NICE.

22:05.658 --> 22:06.626

22:06.626 --> 22:07.594
I HOPE SO, 'CAUSE...

22:07.594 --> 22:08.861
[laughing]

22:08.861 --> 22:09.529
THAT'S NICE.

22:09.529 --> 22:11.531
IT'S SO PRETTY.

22:12.765 --> 22:15.101
BENZINO GAVE K.MICHELLE

22:15.101 --> 22:16.235
A DIAMOND NECKLACE

22:16.235 --> 22:17.404
WITH DIAMONDS.

22:17.404 --> 22:18.405
THAT'S MORE THAN HE EVER

22:18.405 --> 22:19.572
GAVE ME, BESIDES THE RING

22:19.572 --> 22:21.741
HE GAVE ME AND THEN TOOK BACK.

22:21.741 --> 22:23.410
ARE THEY EVEN FRIENDS?

22:23.410 --> 22:25.144
THERE'S LIKE FOUR GIFTS IN HERE.

22:25.144 --> 22:27.013
ALL RIGHTY.

22:27.013 --> 22:28.247
SOME WEAVE.

22:28.247 --> 22:28.915
YOU CAN ALWAYS

22:28.915 --> 22:29.616
USE SOME WEAVE.

22:29.616 --> 22:30.282
CAN YOU NOT ALWAYS

22:30.282 --> 22:31.283
USE SOME WEAVE?

22:31.283 --> 22:32.685
I GOT TO AGREE WITH THAT ONE.

22:32.685 --> 22:34.020
IT'S SOME TEA.

22:34.020 --> 22:34.921
FOR YOUR VOICE, YES.

22:34.921 --> 22:35.588
FOR YOUR VOICE.

22:35.588 --> 22:36.589
FOR HER VOICE.

22:36.589 --> 22:37.424
THERE'S A CD.

22:37.424 --> 22:38.290
PUT IT BACK IN HERE.

22:38.290 --> 22:39.459
THAT'S DJ BLAKE.

22:39.459 --> 22:40.460
I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR THIS.

22:40.460 --> 22:41.528
WHERE'S THE DJ AT?

22:41.528 --> 22:43.563
OH, NO.

22:43.563 --> 22:45.998
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

22:45.998 --> 22:46.966
WHO DO I BRING THIS TO?

22:46.966 --> 22:49.135
NO.

22:49.135 --> 22:50.169
WHAT ARE YOU--

22:50.169 --> 22:51.203
WHY'D YOU GIVE ME THE DISS

22:51.203 --> 22:52.472
RECORD FOR MY BIRTHDAY?

22:52.472 --> 22:53.706
WHAT THE HELL WAS WRONG

22:53.706 --> 22:54.707
WITH KARLIE, TRY TO GIVE ME

22:54.707 --> 22:56.609
A DISS RECORD ON MY BIRTHDAY?

22:56.609 --> 22:58.077
NOT ONLY WAS I DRUNK;

22:58.077 --> 22:59.546
IT WAS MY BIRTHDAY.

22:59.546 --> 23:00.613
I DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD

23:00.613 --> 23:01.814
IDEA FOR HER TO PLAY IT.

23:01.814 --> 23:03.149
WHEN I TOLD K ABOUT THE DISS

23:03.149 --> 23:04.784
TRACK, SHE WAS OKAY WITH IT.

23:04.784 --> 23:05.485
SO I THOUGHT I WOULD

23:05.485 --> 23:06.453
GIVE HER A COPY OF IT

23:06.453 --> 23:07.454
BEFORE SHE EVEN HEARD IT

23:07.454 --> 23:08.455
ON THE STREETS,

23:08.455 --> 23:09.255
NOT TO PUT IT ON BLAST

23:09.255 --> 23:10.089
IN THE CLUB.

23:26.372 --> 23:27.239
I WAS TRYING TO DANCE IT OFF.

23:27.239 --> 23:28.107
I WAS HAVING A GOOD TIME.

23:28.107 --> 23:30.610
THEN I HEARD A LINE IN THE SONG.

23:30.610 --> 23:32.879
SHE WAS QUESTIONING MY STORY

23:32.879 --> 23:33.713
ABOUT MY LIFE.

23:33.713 --> 23:34.380
AND I DON'T PLAY

23:34.380 --> 23:35.314

23:35.314 --> 23:36.282
I DIDN'T HEAR ANY

23:36.282 --> 23:36.983
OF THE LYRICS.

23:36.983 --> 23:37.750
I WANTED TO REALLY

23:37.750 --> 23:39.385
HEAR THE LYRICS TO THAT SONG.

23:39.385 --> 23:40.953
THE LYRICS SAID

23:40.953 --> 23:43.623
THAT MY MENTOR PEED ON ME.

23:43.623 --> 23:45.191
KARLIE?

23:45.191 --> 23:46.292
NO, I SAID "PROBABLY."

23:46.292 --> 23:46.993
BUT THE LYRICS SAID

23:46.993 --> 23:47.927
THAT I CRIED WOLF

23:47.927 --> 23:48.995
ABOUT MY LIFE.

23:48.995 --> 23:51.097
THAT BOTHERED ME, KARLIE.

23:51.097 --> 23:51.798
I DON'T CARE.

23:51.798 --> 23:52.599
IT'S FINE.

23:52.599 --> 23:53.265
I'M COOL.

27:05.357 --> 27:06.025
THE SAME THING, LIKE,

27:06.025 --> 27:07.493

27:20.106 --> 27:20.873
I THINK I HAVE

27:20.873 --> 27:22.108
A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS

27:22.108 --> 27:23.710
IN COMMON WITH JOSELINE.

27:23.710 --> 27:24.610
FIRST PLACE, WE DON'T TAKE

27:24.610 --> 27:25.477
NO [bleep].

27:25.477 --> 27:26.212
SECOND PLACE,

27:26.212 --> 27:27.914
WE DON'T TAKE NO [bleep].

27:27.914 --> 27:28.614
COULD BE FUN,

27:28.614 --> 27:29.916
'CAUSE WE DON'T TAKE NO [bleep].

27:29.916 --> 27:30.783

27:37.323 --> 27:38.357
MAYBE WE COULD HANG OUT.

27:38.357 --> 27:39.425
YOU KNOW, YOU LET ME KNOW.

27:39.425 --> 27:40.592
I THINK THAT K.MICHELLE AND I

27:42.061 --> 27:42.895
SHE GOT A FAT ASS.

27:42.895 --> 27:43.562

27:43.562 --> 27:44.731

27:44.731 --> 27:46.065
I HAVE A SEXY VOICE.

27:46.065 --> 27:47.166
I THINK WE'LL JUST HAVE THEM

27:47.166 --> 27:49.468
BITCHES EATING.

27:49.468 --> 27:50.369
THANK YOU FOR TALKING TO ME.

28:05.918 --> 28:06.886
IF YOU WANT TO JUMP IN

28:12.524 --> 28:13.292

28:30.009 --> 28:33.212

28:33.212 --> 28:34.781
THAT'S USUALLY SOMETHING

28:34.781 --> 28:36.215
THAT A WOMAN WOULD THINK OF

28:36.215 --> 28:37.083
FOR HERSELF,

28:37.083 --> 28:39.418
NOT SOMETHING THAT A MAN--

28:39.418 --> 28:40.853
A HUSBAND WOULD COME

28:40.853 --> 28:43.055
TO A WIFE AND SAY.

28:43.055 --> 28:44.456

SHE AIN'T GONNA TALK TO ME

29:15.187 --> 29:16.455

29:27.266 --> 29:28.534
DO YOU KNOW WHERE SHE BEEN?

29:28.534 --> 29:29.368

OPEN THE DOOR.

37:47.866 --> 37:49.835
OPEN THE--OPEN THE DOOR.

37:49.835 --> 37:51.136

37:51.136 --> 37:51.870
I DON'T KNOW

37:51.870 --> 37:52.871
IF I TRUST STEVIE,

37:52.871 --> 37:54.105
BUT IT IS KIND OF HARD

37:54.105 --> 37:56.442
TO SAY NO TO A NEW BMW.

37:56.442 --> 37:57.343
YOU GIVE ME THIS,

37:57.343 --> 37:58.076

38:02.448 --> 38:03.949
HE SAID, "THERE WILL BE

38:03.949 --> 38:05.384

38:05.384 --> 38:06.785
BUT WE ALL KNOW STEVIE J

38:06.785 --> 38:10.356

IT'S LIKE A BOMB.

38:24.269 --> 38:24.936

38:24.936 --> 38:25.804
THE BEST WAY TO MAKE

38:25.804 --> 38:27.138
A WOMAN HAPPY

38:27.138 --> 38:28.907
IS TO GIVE HER A LUXURY CAR.

38:28.907 --> 38:30.275
MIMI'S THE HAPPIEST WHEN SHE'S

38:30.275 --> 38:31.643
FOCUSED ON THE GOOD GUY,

38:31.643 --> 38:33.879
NOT THESE WANNABE CHUMPS.

38:33.879 --> 38:34.546

38:45.857 --> 38:46.592

38:46.592 --> 38:47.959

38:47.959 --> 38:49.160

38:49.160 --> 38:49.828

38:58.404 --> 38:59.170
I'M NOT GRINDING THAT.

38:59.170 --> 39:00.038
AND HE SHOULD'VE BOUGHT YOU

39:00.038 --> 39:01.106

39:01.106 --> 39:01.773
OKAY, SO WHAT IS

39:01.773 --> 39:02.574
THE ARGUMENT?

39:02.574 --> 39:03.409

39:59.030 --> 39:59.698
YOU'RE DAMAGED.

39:59.698 --> 40:01.533
NIKKO HAS LOST HIS MIND,

40:01.533 --> 40:03.902

40:47.278 --> 40:48.313
WITH MY CAREER.

40:48.313 --> 40:50.048
* RIGHT ABOVE MY A-A-A

40:50.048 --> 40:52.250
I HAD NO REASON

40:52.250 --> 40:52.918
TO HIT YOU,

40:52.918 --> 40:53.985
NO REASON AT ALL.

40:53.985 --> 40:55.521
I SHOULD'VE NEVER DID THAT

40:55.521 --> 40:56.488
BECAUSE YOU'RE SOMEBODY

40:56.488 --> 40:57.923
THAT I LOVE.

40:57.923 --> 40:59.024
I MET WITH YOUR PROBATION

40:59.024 --> 41:00.158
OFFICER THIS MORNING.

41:00.158 --> 41:01.827
SHE WENT DOWN AND APPLIED

41:01.827 --> 41:03.862
FOR A WARRANT FOR YOUR ARREST.

41:03.862 --> 41:04.863
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO--

41:04.863 --> 41:06.197
SHUT THE [bleep] UP.

41:06.197 --> 41:07.298
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO?

41:07.298 --> 41:08.399
YOU'S A WINK, BITCH.

41:08.399 --> 41:09.267
YOU WINKY.

41:09.267 --> 41:10.836
YOU'S A WINK, BITCH!

41:10.836 --> 41:12.838
WINK, BITCH!

41:27.853 --> 41:28.554
DON'T [bleep] AROUND

41:28.554 --> 41:29.220
WITH KIRK, MAN.

41:29.220 --> 41:29.888
OKAY, OKAY.

41:29.888 --> 41:30.989
WORD?

41:30.989 --> 41:32.624
YO, KIRK'S AN ILL DUDE, MAN.

41:32.624 --> 41:34.025
YOU KNOW, HIM AND RASHEEDA

41:34.025 --> 41:35.193
GOING THROUGH A LITTLE THING,

41:35.193 --> 41:35.994
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

41:35.994 --> 41:37.095
THEY GOING THROUGH SOMETHING?

41:37.095 --> 41:37.763
YO, SHE'S--YOU KNOW,

41:37.763 --> 41:38.864
SHE'S PREGNANT.

41:38.864 --> 41:39.898
OH.

41:39.898 --> 41:41.066
AND HE'S TELLING ME, LIKE,

41:41.066 --> 41:42.033
"I WAS PULLING OUT."

41:42.033 --> 41:43.735
I WAS LIKE, "PULLING OUT?"

41:43.735 --> 41:46.271
THAT STOPPED WORKING IN '93.

41:46.271 --> 41:47.939
THAT'S WHAT I SAID!

41:47.939 --> 41:49.708
[both laughing]

41:49.708 --> 41:51.242
CALL HIM THE PULL-OUT ASSASSIN.

41:51.242 --> 41:52.711
I TOLD HIM, BETTER OFF,

41:52.711 --> 41:54.713
"IT'S A BOY!"
