Noble whore!
He is my husband!

00:10.601 --> 00:12.135
He is mine!

00:12.170 --> 00:14.137
ANNORA:
There are nine scriptures.

00:14.172 --> 00:15.338
Jesus...

00:15.373 --> 00:16.973
son of Joseph.

00:17.007 --> 00:20.343
That is Robinus
and his army pursue us.

00:20.378 --> 00:23.346
Piers Gaveston shall be
cast out and exiled.

00:23.381 --> 00:25.014
And it is
my mission,

00:25.049 --> 00:26.983
for both God and country,
to make certain

00:27.017 --> 00:29.818
that his third banishment
be his last.

00:30.987 --> 00:32.154
If my men
could deliver Gaveston,

00:32.189 --> 00:35.458
might that beg
compensation?

LADY LOVE:

00:38.395 --> 00:39.628
CORBETT:
<i>The twin maidens.</i>

00:39.662 --> 00:41.130
<i>Gaveston's half-sisters</i>

00:41.164 --> 00:42.864
and conspirators.

WILKIN:
<i>Your mother's taken ill, boy.</i>

00:45.668 --> 00:47.869
Our good priest
will care for you.

CORBETT: <i>It's time to
travel, good soldiers.</i>

00:50.440 --> 00:52.040
Justice waits in the marshes.

00:52.075 --> 00:55.277
Get yourself cleaned up.

No!

Seeing to our morning meal,
Maddox?

01:20.902 --> 01:23.371
Your appetite's not my concern.

01:23.405 --> 01:26.040
Well, this is
exhilarating,

01:26.074 --> 01:28.676
is it not?

01:28.710 --> 01:31.012
Band of skilled soldiers
on a mission

01:31.046 --> 01:34.382
to capture a French traitor.

01:34.416 --> 01:37.084
Risking all to
save their shire.

01:38.553 --> 01:42.089
Perhaps someday they'll
sing songs of our bravery.

01:42.124 --> 01:44.859
And it will be a short
and clumsy tune.

01:44.893 --> 01:47.962
Full of sour notes
and harsh rhymes.

01:51.767 --> 01:56.884
ASH: No, you're such a beautiful girl.
Aren't you? Yes, you are.

01:56.919 --> 01:58.004
You have a way with them.

01:58.039 --> 02:01.741
It is the oat slop
that makes these girls happy.

02:01.776 --> 02:04.044
And the other
animals?

02:04.078 --> 02:06.880
The brutes who bind me?

02:08.115 --> 02:10.717
What makes them friendly?

02:10.751 --> 02:14.087
Their tempers
are nothing I tend to.

02:14.121 --> 02:16.690
You are very wise.

02:16.724 --> 02:19.392
And such a kind face.

02:22.296 --> 02:25.097
May I have a better look?

02:39.813 --> 02:42.114
Like an angel.

02:42.148 --> 02:43.782
No.

02:43.817 --> 02:47.086
Although I will
have wings someday.

02:47.120 --> 02:49.588
Of course you will...

02:49.622 --> 02:51.456
Ash.

02:51.490 --> 02:52.958
Ash.

02:55.128 --> 02:57.129
May I ask a favor,

02:57.163 --> 02:59.363
Ash the angel?

02:59.397 --> 03:02.433
My ties pull so tightly
after yesterday's ride,

03:02.467 --> 03:05.770
I can barely feel
my hands and feet.

03:05.804 --> 03:08.106
Might you loosen them a bit...

03:09.842 --> 03:12.309
allow the color
to return?

03:14.179 --> 03:15.613
(horse huffs)

03:15.647 --> 03:16.614
Yea.

03:16.648 --> 03:19.082
If you promise not to run away.

03:19.117 --> 03:21.785
Of course.

03:36.833 --> 03:38.868
(whispers):
Thank you.

03:44.207 --> 03:47.268
Sorry, girl,
I didn't forget about you.

03:47.578 --> 03:49.345
Where were we?

03:50.381 --> 03:51.950
You want some more
oat slop?

03:52.057 --> 03:53.826
Yeah, that's nice.

03:53.953 --> 03:56.510
Aw, there's a good girl.
There's a...

04:06.829 --> 04:09.798
(door opens)

04:15.004 --> 04:18.307
What are these quarters?

04:18.341 --> 04:20.173
They are my maiden's.

04:24.045 --> 04:26.013
I am a prisoner.

04:26.047 --> 04:29.317
You are restrained because
of your misguided rage.

04:29.351 --> 04:31.185
But no one
other than the priest,

04:31.219 --> 04:33.354
my maiden and Wilkin know this.

04:33.388 --> 04:34.855
Wilkin?

04:34.889 --> 04:36.490
Yes.

04:36.525 --> 04:38.492
That is the name of the man

04:38.527 --> 04:41.862
claiming the identity
of your husband, Gawain,

04:41.896 --> 04:43.197
who I've learned
was killed

04:43.231 --> 04:45.032
in the same battle
as my husband.

04:45.066 --> 04:46.534
Killed?

04:46.568 --> 04:49.937
I doubt my lady would try
to lay claim to a dead man.

04:54.141 --> 04:57.410
Gawain Maddox
was slain in battle.

04:57.445 --> 05:00.513
You opened your heart
to save a stranger,

05:00.548 --> 05:02.816
claiming he was
your husband.

05:02.850 --> 05:04.884
You took that risk,

05:04.918 --> 05:06.886
hoping to create a better...

05:06.920 --> 05:09.322
kinder family.

05:09.357 --> 05:11.891
But the grip of that illusion
must be broken.

05:11.925 --> 05:14.494
You are the one in need
of breaking illusion.

05:14.528 --> 05:16.696
- I know my husband...
- Stop!

05:16.731 --> 05:18.865
You have two choices, woman.

05:18.899 --> 05:21.099
If you stay lost
in this distorted dream,

05:21.133 --> 05:23.869
you will face the claim
of assault on a baroness.

05:23.903 --> 05:26.872
No one will believe what you
say about Wilkin and myself.

05:26.906 --> 05:29.941
It'll be taken as the madness
of a tortured woman.

05:29.976 --> 05:31.744
You will be
put to death,

05:31.778 --> 05:35.280
and your children
turned over to servitude.

05:35.314 --> 05:38.717
Let that harshness settle
in you, Jessamy.

05:38.752 --> 05:41.920
Use it to tear down
the wall between you

05:41.954 --> 05:43.922
and God's truth.

05:47.960 --> 05:49.628
(door opens)

05:49.662 --> 05:51.128
(door closes)

05:58.637 --> 06:00.872
They have the priest.

06:00.906 --> 06:03.408
They took an innocent.

06:08.246 --> 06:10.815
The boy.

06:16.454 --> 06:19.423
You must eat, child.

06:40.877 --> 06:43.980
ROBINUS:
No more.

06:44.014 --> 06:46.816
He is fortified
with faith.

06:46.850 --> 06:49.785
ROBINUS: The pain just
strengthens that.

06:49.820 --> 06:52.621
Tend to his wounds.

06:52.656 --> 06:54.824
Nourish him.

06:54.858 --> 06:57.193

Yea.

How are we to know
they hold the Frenchman?

09:35.363 --> 09:38.965
He is there.
I can smell the arrogance.

09:42.904 --> 09:44.871
The door on the north side
is fortified.

09:44.906 --> 09:47.707
Wagons block the entry.
This is the only ingress.

09:47.741 --> 09:50.543
Seems our fugitive twin
has yet to find her way here.

09:50.578 --> 09:52.845
- There's no sign of readiness.
WILKIN: - Yea.

09:52.879 --> 09:55.348
We need to get a better sense
of their true number.

09:55.382 --> 09:57.149
Draw them out somehow.

Oh.

10:10.764 --> 10:13.398
Sorry. This is Bernadette.

10:13.433 --> 10:16.535
We met at the stream.
Lovely girl.

10:16.569 --> 10:17.737
Not much of a talker.

10:17.771 --> 10:19.538
Which I have to admit,

10:19.572 --> 10:22.074
I rather like.
(chuckles)

10:22.109 --> 10:23.875
It's the desire of every man.

10:23.909 --> 10:26.410
A beautiful, silent doe.

Come on.

10:50.135 --> 10:52.302
Hold there.

10:52.336 --> 10:55.438
Ah. Yea, good knights.

10:55.473 --> 10:58.375
I come bearing fresh meat.

10:58.409 --> 10:59.777
I trap these woods.

10:59.811 --> 11:02.545
I see that you have
many hungry men within.

11:02.580 --> 11:04.714
We've not enough mouths to feed
on a full cow.

11:04.749 --> 11:06.048
Ah.

11:06.083 --> 11:07.550
Then smoke the rest.

11:07.585 --> 11:09.118
She's thick with fat.

- Keeps till winter.

WILKIN:
Sounds like Pembroke travels

11:14.759 --> 11:16.393
with no more
than half a legion.

11:16.427 --> 11:20.263
Not to call attention to the
transport of an exiled noble.

11:20.298 --> 11:22.999
Crafty trapper.

11:23.033 --> 11:24.167
We move off in the morning,

11:24.201 --> 11:25.835
but the steward will take it
to travel.

11:25.869 --> 11:27.636
Tie her up
with our spare steeds.

11:27.671 --> 11:31.174
(bellows)

11:31.208 --> 11:34.010
Yea?

11:34.044 --> 11:36.946
(bellows)

11:36.980 --> 11:38.881
That seems best.

11:40.650 --> 11:42.618
Yea, there.

11:42.652 --> 11:44.652
We will take your game, trapper.

11:44.687 --> 11:48.456
I'm afraid my girl doesn't much
care for the company of horses.

11:48.490 --> 11:51.793
They turn her innards,
spoil her meat.

11:51.828 --> 11:54.329
- (coins jangling)
- Good day.

11:59.501 --> 12:02.804
LADY LOVE:
I am sure you must be hungry.

12:06.975 --> 12:09.443
Where are my children?

12:09.477 --> 12:10.845
The baby is with my maiden,

12:10.879 --> 12:13.280
and the priest
looks after your son.

12:13.315 --> 12:16.317
I cannot eat with hands bound.

12:27.762 --> 12:30.530
I am to be fed like a child?

12:30.565 --> 12:32.833
Yes.

12:32.868 --> 12:36.035
Or not at all.

12:51.719 --> 12:55.088
You spoke of two choices.

13:00.762 --> 13:04.063
If you accept God's truth
in this matter,

13:04.098 --> 13:07.367
acknowledge
that Wilkin did not betray you,

13:07.402 --> 13:09.669
for he is not
your husband,

13:09.704 --> 13:13.373
if you convince me
that you are able to do that,

13:13.407 --> 13:16.008
then there will never be mention
of your attack

13:16.042 --> 13:19.378
and I will see to it
that you, your son, and daughter

13:19.413 --> 13:21.380
will always have a home and work

13:21.415 --> 13:23.416
here
in Ventrishire.

13:29.389 --> 13:32.357
(bellows)

13:32.392 --> 13:34.593
What ho, good knights.

13:38.665 --> 13:41.567
My little brother often...

13:41.601 --> 13:45.437
gets attached
to the things we trap.

13:45.471 --> 13:47.939
How many others
in your trapper family?

13:47.973 --> 13:49.574
Just me and the half-wit.

13:49.608 --> 13:52.577
I may be half-witted,
but you're halfhearted.

13:52.611 --> 13:54.412
Bernadette doesn't
like horses.

13:54.447 --> 13:55.747
She thinks 'em filthy.

13:55.781 --> 13:58.249
The beasts do not talk.

13:59.418 --> 14:01.385
Give some consideration.

14:01.420 --> 14:03.187
He took a mule kick to the head

14:03.221 --> 14:04.856
while just
a babe.

14:04.890 --> 14:07.624
- (bellows)
- Yes, he is,

14:07.659 --> 14:08.725
indeed,
Bernadette.

14:08.760 --> 14:10.394
Father did the
same thing.

14:10.429 --> 14:12.229
- That's why mother left.
- Did what?

14:12.264 --> 14:13.597
What did that doe say
about me?

14:13.631 --> 14:15.266
Leave the beast

14:15.300 --> 14:16.767
and be off with you both.

14:16.801 --> 14:19.303
Yes, sir.

14:24.176 --> 14:26.577
(arrows whizzing)

14:26.611 --> 14:30.647
(shouting, grunting)

14:42.059 --> 14:44.060

14:54.505 --> 14:56.105
All quiet.

15:04.982 --> 15:06.649

15:31.841 --> 15:33.341

15:33.375 --> 15:36.176
Watch our flank.

15:37.679 --> 15:40.180
(struggling sounds in distance)

15:41.716 --> 15:43.684
(shouting, grunting)

16:08.542 --> 16:11.210
Where is Gaveston?

16:13.413 --> 16:15.480
Is that French pig worth a slice
to your throat?

16:15.514 --> 16:18.349
(panting)

16:18.384 --> 16:21.352
(chuckles)

16:21.387 --> 16:24.355
All the dead ones,

16:24.390 --> 16:27.059
pull down
their breeches.

16:29.562 --> 16:32.197
I'm gonna kill you,

16:32.231 --> 16:34.600
strip you, then cut off
all their cocks

16:34.634 --> 16:37.034
and stuff them
in your mouth.

16:37.069 --> 16:39.036
Then leave you

16:39.071 --> 16:41.205
at the door to be found
by noble guests.

16:41.239 --> 16:44.441
(chuckles)
The lore it will inspire.

16:44.476 --> 16:46.376
ASH (laughs):
Yea.

16:46.411 --> 16:49.546
- The naked knight with
the cock-stuffed mouth. - That is mad!

16:49.581 --> 16:51.582
And without honor!

16:51.617 --> 16:53.584
That is the leverage
I am plying.

16:56.287 --> 16:58.589
- (panting)
- Chop their meat.

16:58.623 --> 17:00.356
KNIGHT:
No!

17:00.390 --> 17:01.891
No!

17:09.299 --> 17:11.635
(shouting, grunting)

17:14.905 --> 17:18.742
Sir Gaveston! So sorry
to intrude on your supper.

17:19.743 --> 17:21.444
How, uh...

17:21.478 --> 17:23.045
What is this,
Corbett, huh?

17:23.079 --> 17:24.614
No need for worry,

17:24.647 --> 17:25.881
my dear Piers.

17:25.915 --> 17:27.250
(grunts)

17:27.284 --> 17:30.119
(panting)

17:31.321 --> 17:35.324
We are here to rescue you.

17:38.656 --> 17:42.184
ROBINUS: I am impressed
with your fortitude, Ronan.

17:42.357 --> 17:46.993
Those years in armor,
slaying Normans has served you.

17:47.028 --> 17:49.463
My bygone military service

17:49.497 --> 17:54.401
is not what gives me strength,
Archdeacon.

17:55.403 --> 17:58.472
Or should I call you "master"?

17:58.506 --> 18:00.474
<i>Socijs</i> Rosula.

18:00.508 --> 18:03.477
Ah.
(chuckles)

18:03.511 --> 18:05.245
I see that the
seraphim have shared

18:05.280 --> 18:09.283
their interpretation
of history.

18:09.317 --> 18:12.485
Am I allowed the
same courtesy?

18:13.520 --> 18:16.922
The Order of the Seraphim

18:16.956 --> 18:21.661
carry and protect dangerous
and heretical gospels.

18:21.695 --> 18:24.664
If these scriptures
were to become known,

18:24.698 --> 18:27.166
they would create chaos

18:27.201 --> 18:30.803
and unimaginable strife.

18:30.837 --> 18:33.372
I've read some
of these scriptures.

18:33.407 --> 18:35.974
They are not heresy.

18:36.009 --> 18:39.011
The only chaos
it might stir would be

18:39.045 --> 18:43.182
within the walls
of the Pope's chambers.

18:44.751 --> 18:48.521
The next time you take a walk
through your village,

18:48.555 --> 18:52.591
look in the eyes
of your followers.

18:52.625 --> 18:57.429
Can they trust
their free will, huh?

18:57.463 --> 19:00.098
- They have a right to know the truth.
- You know as well

19:00.132 --> 19:03.134
as I do that these people
are ignorant and lost,

19:03.168 --> 19:06.137
driven by fear and fantasy.

19:06.171 --> 19:08.473
Our church gives

19:08.507 --> 19:13.311
these simple believers
a sound, a moral structure,

19:13.346 --> 19:16.814
a divinity they can understand.

19:16.849 --> 19:20.652
Money and influence

19:20.686 --> 19:24.656
are needed
to provide that foundation.

19:24.690 --> 19:27.659
Even if that foundation corrupts

19:27.693 --> 19:32.329
the very teachings of the man
at the center of our faith.

19:32.364 --> 19:33.564
The seraphim

19:33.598 --> 19:36.234
are misguided zealots.

19:38.270 --> 19:42.706
They would undermine
a thousand years of God's work.

19:42.741 --> 19:46.244
The Rosula has a
divine purpose.

19:46.278 --> 19:49.046
We must stop the seraphim

19:49.081 --> 19:51.548
and destroy these scriptures

19:51.583 --> 19:55.253
before they destroy our faith.

19:55.287 --> 19:57.755
You can help me
do that, Ronan.

19:57.790 --> 19:59.891
Please.

19:59.925 --> 20:03.928
Tell me where the woman
and Templar are hiding.

20:05.931 --> 20:11.635
Countless souls rest
in your hands, good priest.

20:15.472 --> 20:17.674
(crickets chirping)

20:22.313 --> 20:25.982
Go home... my lovely.

20:37.194 --> 20:40.063
CORBETT:
Ah, Lord Pembroke.

20:40.097 --> 20:43.366
No! Do not hurt her!
Do not!

20:44.435 --> 20:47.203
Our apologies for rousing you

20:47.238 --> 20:50.240
from your lovely
dark slumber.

20:50.274 --> 20:51.541
Who are you?

20:51.575 --> 20:53.643
Under what banner
do you seize my home?

20:53.677 --> 20:56.212
- The banner of justice.
CORBETT: - We are sent by neither

20:56.247 --> 20:57.346
noble nor crown.

20:57.380 --> 20:59.015
What are your
intentions, sir?

20:59.049 --> 21:02.151
Dead knights, a bound criminal.

21:02.185 --> 21:04.554
What is there
to be confused about?

21:04.588 --> 21:06.188
What do you intend to do
with our honored earl?

21:06.222 --> 21:08.024
AYMER:
I swore

21:08.058 --> 21:10.660
to the king that no harm
would befall Sir Gaveston.

21:10.694 --> 21:12.161
I lead the prisoner

21:12.195 --> 21:14.830
safely out of England.

21:14.865 --> 21:16.566
He travels like
no prisoner I know.

21:16.600 --> 21:18.868
I am relieved
that now you see

21:18.902 --> 21:21.235
the foolishness
of your oath.

21:21.270 --> 21:24.372
And I thank you for
willingly giving us his head.

21:24.406 --> 21:26.207
Any harm put to Gaveston will
fall threefold on all of us.

21:26.241 --> 21:28.409
CORBETT:
Not if His Majesty knows but

21:28.444 --> 21:30.078
a shrouded truth.

21:30.112 --> 21:31.580
You were attacked.

21:31.614 --> 21:33.381
Bandits, and they
felled your legion,

21:33.415 --> 21:37.052
and took your goods and
your noble prisoner.

21:37.086 --> 21:38.553
And then vanished

21:38.588 --> 21:42.423
into the swampy darkness.

21:42.458 --> 21:44.292
Edward is not a fool.

21:44.326 --> 21:46.927
That is a sentiment
that stirs debate.

21:47.929 --> 21:50.431
I cannot give way
to any of this.

21:50.466 --> 21:53.101
My loyalty is to Edward,

21:53.135 --> 21:56.070
not to the barons who
conspire against him.

21:56.105 --> 21:59.873
Well, that saddens me, Aymer.

21:59.908 --> 22:01.542
- (groans softly)
CORBETT: - Your mistress is

22:01.577 --> 22:02.942
quite beautiful.

22:02.977 --> 22:04.411
I can understand

22:04.445 --> 22:07.447
why you risk rank
and privilege to be with her.

22:07.482 --> 22:10.717
No! No!

22:10.751 --> 22:12.719
Punisher...

22:12.753 --> 22:14.921
- (Aymer groans)
- Ready your tools.

22:14.955 --> 22:16.889
- Torture his whore.
AYMER: - No.

22:16.924 --> 22:18.725
- Slowly.
- (whimpers)

22:18.759 --> 22:23.263
Make the loyal Lord Pembroke
witness her pain.

22:23.297 --> 22:25.797
AYMER: - No!
- (crying)

22:29.302 --> 22:31.103
(woman panting)

22:31.138 --> 22:33.139
Your learned punisher skills
are your service

22:33.173 --> 22:34.773
to Lady Love and shire.

22:34.807 --> 22:36.641
To punish the guilty.

22:36.675 --> 22:39.110
The mistress is a play
in our game of war.

22:39.145 --> 22:41.446
We do not play
your game.

22:41.480 --> 22:43.848
If you need
to wrap it in reason,

22:43.882 --> 22:46.484
then take her to task
for adultery.

22:46.519 --> 22:48.353
A whore
who violated a married bed.

22:48.387 --> 22:50.655
And when we return
to Ventrishire,

22:50.689 --> 22:52.390
do we punish all the nobles

22:52.424 --> 22:54.759
who do the same?

22:56.262 --> 22:58.929
Chamberlain,
I dispatched one of our horsemen

22:58.964 --> 23:01.766
to inform the Earl of Warwick
of our progress.

23:01.800 --> 23:03.134
Good.

23:04.870 --> 23:08.272
Now dispatch yourself
out the door.

23:08.306 --> 23:10.474
Yes.

23:10.508 --> 23:12.977
Sir.

23:24.056 --> 23:26.790
Ply the mistress with pain

23:26.824 --> 23:29.560
till Pembroke gives
way to our need...

23:30.895 --> 23:33.730
and I will let you both
complete your vengeance.

23:37.101 --> 23:39.369
If...

23:39.404 --> 23:42.539
our reeve and Sir Locke

23:42.574 --> 23:45.409
should meet an untimely death,
I will assume

23:45.443 --> 23:48.378
it was but a risk
of their sworn duty.

23:48.413 --> 23:50.013
WILKIN:
Only you,

23:50.047 --> 23:54.383
Corbett,
would use death to buy pain.

24:02.827 --> 24:05.228
I will leave the widowers
of West River Riding

24:05.262 --> 24:07.731
to make a decision.

24:24.080 --> 24:25.715
Do you love him?

24:28.885 --> 24:32.388
Knowing my feelings will not
serve you in this decision.

24:32.422 --> 24:34.590
Do they serve you?

24:34.625 --> 24:37.092
Punisher or not,

24:37.127 --> 24:39.629
this Wilkin is still
but a freeman,

24:39.663 --> 24:41.930
and you, a baroness.

24:41.965 --> 24:45.234
Yes.

24:45.269 --> 24:47.069
And Wilkin and I must decide

24:47.103 --> 24:49.671
if that challenge
is worth the risk.

25:03.719 --> 25:05.720
May I see my children
in the morning?

25:05.755 --> 25:08.055
Of course.

25:14.096 --> 25:16.597
Good night.

25:17.800 --> 25:21.135
(door opens)

25:21.170 --> 25:23.971
(crickets chirping)

25:24.006 --> 25:27.008
There was one
with belly straps.

25:33.949 --> 25:36.184
Yea?

25:39.687 --> 25:42.155
That should work.

26:00.083 --> 26:02.352
Bring in Pembroke.

26:08.726 --> 26:12.228
I'd give fair distance,
Sir Locke.

26:12.263 --> 26:15.732
The blood and piss could fly.

26:15.766 --> 26:17.933
(crying softly)

26:27.610 --> 26:31.346
(whispers): I will slide a
cold spike between your legs.

26:32.448 --> 26:34.816
But I will not hurt you.

26:34.850 --> 26:37.118
When you feel my pinch,

26:37.153 --> 26:38.953
give a bloody scream.

26:38.988 --> 26:41.290
Convince your lord
that the wedge is inside you.

26:41.324 --> 26:44.159
This is the only way
I can spare your pain.

26:49.265 --> 26:51.732
This is barbaric.

26:51.767 --> 26:53.467
Indeed.

26:57.940 --> 27:01.109
- What is this?
- Your pledge.

27:01.143 --> 27:03.477
My assurance.

27:03.512 --> 27:06.614
A writ that tells
how you willingly

27:06.648 --> 27:09.317
gave over Sir Gaveston
to the barons.

27:09.351 --> 27:11.151
When you sign it,

27:11.186 --> 27:16.089
you and your lovely brown whore
are free to leave.

27:16.124 --> 27:19.593
I will never sign such a thing.

27:19.628 --> 27:22.296
(crying quietly)

27:24.566 --> 27:27.034
(whimpering)

27:29.070 --> 27:31.339
(whimpering)

27:32.574 --> 27:36.175
It is not as precise
as the pear,

27:36.210 --> 27:38.311
but it will serve
the same end.

27:38.346 --> 27:39.846
(crying)

27:48.088 --> 27:52.291
(screaming)

27:54.528 --> 27:56.195
- (screaming)
- (grunts)

27:56.230 --> 27:58.164
(screaming)

27:58.198 --> 28:01.066
(screaming continues)

28:04.203 --> 28:07.373
(crying)

28:16.249 --> 28:21.052
This will do well in ripping
the soft flesh from her slot.

28:21.087 --> 28:24.822
WILKIN:
Yea. Ready the rags.

28:24.857 --> 28:27.025
This tear will
make the blood gush.

28:35.301 --> 28:37.302
(screaming)

28:38.404 --> 28:40.272
Shh.

28:40.306 --> 28:42.107
(screaming)

28:42.141 --> 28:44.276
No more!

28:44.310 --> 28:46.911
(woman whimpers)

28:46.945 --> 28:51.148
(groaning softly)

28:51.182 --> 28:55.085
(woman cries quietly)

29:05.563 --> 29:07.731
(crying)

29:43.799 --> 29:45.434
All that pain,

29:45.468 --> 29:48.303
yet not a drop of blood.

30:05.221 --> 30:07.822
(sighs)

30:10.025 --> 30:13.394
Remember when our greatest dread
was a weak harvest?

30:15.364 --> 30:17.331
We are no longer
farmers, brother.

30:17.366 --> 30:19.333
Yea.

30:19.368 --> 30:21.870
And I must confess, Wilkin...

30:24.272 --> 30:28.042
I am more myself
inside this turn towards blood.

30:39.588 --> 30:41.589
Thank you.

30:49.732 --> 30:52.366
Are you a descendant
of the soldiers

30:52.400 --> 30:54.401
blessed by Christ?

30:58.073 --> 31:00.241
You were a soldier?

31:00.275 --> 31:02.243
Yes.

31:02.277 --> 31:04.911
The choice of an angry boy.

31:04.946 --> 31:06.913
And a priest--

31:06.948 --> 31:09.316
whose choice was that?

31:10.418 --> 31:12.720
A man.

31:12.754 --> 31:15.589
Anger replaced by remorse.

31:31.440 --> 31:32.972
How can I ease

31:33.006 --> 31:35.007
your spiritual
distress, Father?

31:39.346 --> 31:42.615
Will you tell us where
the seraphim hides?

31:48.822 --> 31:51.624
The boy doesn't know the woman

31:51.658 --> 31:53.226
or Templar.

31:53.260 --> 31:55.761
Return him to his village.

31:55.796 --> 31:58.131
We will release the child
unharmed

31:58.165 --> 32:02.068
after you lead us
to the seraphim.

32:02.103 --> 32:04.103
You have my word.

32:07.774 --> 32:10.076
I will take you
to the healer

32:10.110 --> 32:12.111
and her scarred knight.

32:22.322 --> 32:24.657
We must leave this place.

32:28.328 --> 32:31.230
A darker journey lies ahead.

32:38.671 --> 32:40.672
(door hinges creak)

32:41.707 --> 32:43.708
Free his binds.

32:43.709 --> 32:44.709
Yes, sir.

32:49.315 --> 32:51.316
Leave us.

32:55.688 --> 32:57.989
(door closes)

33:21.746 --> 33:24.815
You are a leader,
Milus.

33:24.849 --> 33:28.185
I am surprised
that you blindly follow

33:28.219 --> 33:30.520
that flock of noble sheep.

33:30.555 --> 33:32.755
But am I really following them,

33:32.790 --> 33:34.791
dear Piers?

33:36.294 --> 33:38.261
Do not give up hope
on my ability

33:38.296 --> 33:40.297
to turn a new page.

33:44.768 --> 33:47.270
Please...

33:47.305 --> 33:50.873
enlighten my troubled mind.

33:50.908 --> 33:54.544
It seems my tongue only loosens

33:54.579 --> 33:56.646
when my cock rests

33:56.681 --> 33:58.682
in a handsome mouth.

34:02.920 --> 34:06.355
Yes.

34:06.389 --> 34:08.591
I am sure it does.

34:30.980 --> 34:32.981
(gagging)

34:38.788 --> 34:42.424
It appears I am as limp
as a wet palm frond.

34:42.458 --> 34:45.261
You clearly no longer
possess the power

34:45.295 --> 34:47.795
to arouse, dear Piers.

34:54.270 --> 34:56.237
How can you rally the king

34:56.272 --> 34:58.406
when you cannot even excite
a simple,

34:58.440 --> 35:00.441
dirt-born rod?

35:07.449 --> 35:10.252
(door opens)

35:10.286 --> 35:12.520
Bind the little French bitch.

35:20.219 --> 35:22.687
- Did you find the priest?
- I am sorry, Baroness,

35:22.721 --> 35:24.455
but Father Ruskin nor the boy

35:24.489 --> 35:25.990
are anywhere in the castle
or court.

35:26.024 --> 35:27.324
Where would the priest
take the boy?

35:27.358 --> 35:29.359
He often travels to villages
within our shire,

35:29.394 --> 35:31.462
to say Mass and
offer sacraments.

35:31.496 --> 35:33.297
That service is done
at the month's end,

35:33.331 --> 35:34.865
and always with my knowledge.

35:34.900 --> 35:37.501
My Lady, should I alert
the captain of the guards?

35:37.535 --> 35:39.003
No.

35:39.037 --> 35:41.537
I will wait till
the end of the day.

35:41.572 --> 35:45.441
Let us hope it was a sudden
and joyful adventure.

35:51.015 --> 35:53.016
(Pippa cooing)

35:59.389 --> 36:01.958
She has settled now that
she is with her mother.

36:01.993 --> 36:03.359
Yes.

36:03.393 --> 36:04.961
Where's Luca?

36:04.996 --> 36:06.829
Fishing.

36:06.863 --> 36:09.465
The priest took him
on an outing.

36:09.500 --> 36:10.833
Fishing?

36:10.867 --> 36:13.402
Odd venture for a priest.

36:14.805 --> 36:17.540
Were not Jesus' disciples
fisherman?

36:17.574 --> 36:20.843
I thought they were carpenters.

36:20.877 --> 36:23.012
Well, like the priest,

36:23.046 --> 36:25.515
they were men who returned home
at a day's end.

36:25.549 --> 36:27.383
(Pippa cooing)

36:37.593 --> 36:39.261
So has sleep

36:39.295 --> 36:40.362
and the touch
of an innocent

36:40.396 --> 36:41.896
given you a clear mind?

36:44.500 --> 36:46.434
Yea.

36:48.737 --> 36:53.074
I will hold to your truth
about my husband...

36:53.108 --> 36:55.410
if you can offer proof
of your promise.

36:55.444 --> 36:57.679
Proof?

36:57.713 --> 36:59.847
Forgive me, Baroness,

36:59.882 --> 37:03.250
but I have seen the whims
of nobles ruin many a lives.

37:03.285 --> 37:05.887
How am I to know that
you will truly keep your word

37:05.921 --> 37:07.922
and care of my children?

37:09.558 --> 37:11.592
There is no decree
that can be written

37:11.626 --> 37:14.295
for our understanding, Jessamy.

37:16.065 --> 37:18.066
You have my word

37:18.100 --> 37:20.434
in the presence of God
and your child.

37:34.782 --> 37:38.118
I am sorry, my lady.

37:41.655 --> 37:44.324
Thank you.

37:44.358 --> 37:46.392
You have made the right choice.

37:46.427 --> 37:48.294
The choice of a good mother.

38:15.488 --> 38:17.123
Good earl.

38:17.157 --> 38:18.590
A fine day
for justice.

38:18.625 --> 38:21.127
BEAUCHAMP:
Indeed.

38:21.161 --> 38:23.629
How did you come to know that
the two-faced Earl of Pembroke

38:23.663 --> 38:26.132
was securing
the puffed-up worm?

38:26.166 --> 38:28.734
- We turned over the right rock.
- (laughs)

38:30.403 --> 38:32.804
And I believe

38:32.838 --> 38:34.806
he will keep
but one face,

38:34.840 --> 38:37.208
now that he has
sworn allegiance.

38:38.411 --> 38:40.011
BEAUCHAMP:
You do me

38:40.045 --> 38:42.481
and all of England honor,
good chamberlain.

38:42.515 --> 38:44.149
Thank you, sir.

38:44.183 --> 38:45.817
It was mostly the efforts
of my valiant men.

38:48.354 --> 38:50.322
That is bonded by

38:50.356 --> 38:52.824
the Royal Bank
of Windsor.

38:52.858 --> 38:54.926
Good as silver.

38:54.960 --> 38:57.361
Your funds will arrive
by month's end.

38:59.564 --> 39:03.034
Shall we hold a court,
then, Sir Corbett?

39:03.068 --> 39:05.369
It would be the fair
and honorable thing to do.

39:16.515 --> 39:18.015
BEAUCHAMP:
Sir Piers Gaveston,

39:18.049 --> 39:22.353
First Earl of Cornwall,

39:22.387 --> 39:23.887
you stand before us

39:23.922 --> 39:26.023
accused of treason.

39:26.357 --> 39:28.322
Guilty

39:28.357 --> 39:31.260
of deceitful
and malicious counsel

39:31.295 --> 39:33.930
to Edward II,
King of England.

39:35.099 --> 39:37.667
You willfully disregarded
the decree

39:37.701 --> 39:40.003
of immediate continental exile,

39:40.037 --> 39:41.504
thereby condemning yourself

39:41.538 --> 39:44.406
to be known
as a public enemy

39:44.441 --> 39:47.043
to all of England.

39:48.712 --> 39:51.180
You make a mockery of law.

39:51.214 --> 39:53.016
BEAUCHAMP:
Those here present

39:53.050 --> 39:55.884
who find Sir Gaveston
guilty of said charges,

39:55.918 --> 39:57.218
say to it, aye.

39:57.253 --> 40:00.188
Speaking in proxy
for Lowry Love Ventris,

40:00.222 --> 40:02.624
Baroness of Ventrishire, aye.

40:06.462 --> 40:07.963
Aye.

40:11.668 --> 40:14.936
An undisputed verdict.

40:14.971 --> 40:17.305
I will be remembered

40:17.339 --> 40:19.274
as a martyr

40:19.308 --> 40:22.076
who stood against
your diplomatic charade.

40:22.110 --> 40:23.610
A clear voice singing the truth

40:23.645 --> 40:25.980
above a choir of ignorance!
(grunts)

40:28.283 --> 40:30.417
I...

40:30.451 --> 40:32.252
Guy de Beauchamp,

40:32.287 --> 40:35.255
the tenth Earl of Warwick,
sentence thee,

40:35.290 --> 40:39.526
Sir Piers Gaveston,
to death by beheading.

40:50.137 --> 40:51.771
My blade has the weight

40:51.806 --> 40:53.807
to make quick work of it.

40:55.109 --> 40:57.110
You know the swing
of your sword best.

40:57.144 --> 40:58.778
I give you the honor.

40:58.813 --> 41:01.748
I only carry the banner
of our shire, good earl.

41:01.782 --> 41:03.482
I am not a titled noble.

41:03.517 --> 41:07.118
GAVESTON:
You pathetic cravens.

41:08.121 --> 41:10.289
All bluster and pomp.

41:10.324 --> 41:12.958
Wanting my head,
but too frightened

41:12.992 --> 41:15.494
the truth may find
its way to Edward.

41:15.529 --> 41:18.631
And he will surely take the head
of the man who takes mine.

41:18.665 --> 41:21.534
I expect this weakness
from you, Beauchamp.

41:21.568 --> 41:24.302
But you, Corbett,

41:24.337 --> 41:27.139
a decorated warrior.

41:27.173 --> 41:30.142
It seems
the tiny baroness

41:30.176 --> 41:31.643
has bigger balls than you!

41:31.677 --> 41:33.378
This would be a job

41:33.412 --> 41:36.481
for an executioner,
would it not?

41:36.515 --> 41:39.551
There are too many eyes
witness to this kill.

41:39.585 --> 41:42.154
Gaveston is right.

41:42.188 --> 41:44.222
This could get back to the king.

41:44.257 --> 41:46.190
And Lady Love needs
her chamberlain.

41:56.235 --> 41:58.536
Carry on, executioner.

42:04.009 --> 42:06.210
(panting)

42:09.514 --> 42:14.351
I do not regret
loving someone above my status.

42:17.790 --> 42:20.258
Even if this is the fate.

42:20.292 --> 42:23.394
(whimpering)

42:28.432 --> 42:31.902
(gasping)

43:00.062 --> 43:02.531
Where is the boy?

43:02.565 --> 43:04.866
By the hearth, unharmed.

43:08.738 --> 43:13.074
Did your master tell you
what I did in the service

43:13.109 --> 43:15.076
of the king's army?

43:15.111 --> 43:18.179
No.

43:18.213 --> 43:20.915
He should have.

43:24.787 --> 43:27.956
(grunts)

43:27.990 --> 43:29.958
I was an assassin.

43:29.992 --> 43:32.660
(grunting)

43:56.518 --> 43:58.051
You unharmed, lad?

43:58.086 --> 43:59.719
Yes.

44:07.895 --> 44:11.564
♪

44:38.992 --> 44:41.527
Well, this must be
our warrior priest.

44:49.301 --> 44:51.302
(wagon rattling)

45:20.349 --> 45:22.449
This will settle
many of our accounts

45:22.450 --> 45:23.951
and put us on much
firmer ground.

45:23.985 --> 45:25.552
Thank you, Milus.

45:25.586 --> 45:28.388
I'm in your debt.

45:28.422 --> 45:32.091
It is my duty and my honor
to serve you, Lady Love.

45:36.163 --> 45:39.766
May I ask what troubles you,
my lady?

45:39.800 --> 45:42.769
Father Ruskin
and Master Gawain's son Luca

45:42.803 --> 45:45.705
have been missing
for two days now.

45:45.740 --> 45:48.207
The boy was
in the priest's charge.

45:48.242 --> 45:51.043
Our priest made no mention
of a pilgrimage?

45:51.378 --> 45:52.912
No.

45:52.947 --> 45:56.048
His belongings and steed
are all still here.

46:00.720 --> 46:04.356
I will gather our resources
at once, my lady.

46:04.391 --> 46:06.858
Scouts, trackers.

46:06.893 --> 46:09.761
We will leave
with the sunrise.

46:09.796 --> 46:11.997
Thank you.

46:14.134 --> 46:16.935
Does Maddox
know about the boy?

46:16.970 --> 46:18.570
No.

46:18.604 --> 46:21.772
He does not.

46:23.109 --> 46:25.076
Perhaps it would be best

46:25.111 --> 46:27.579
if you were
to tell him, my lady.

46:27.613 --> 46:30.582
Your grace
and calm manner

46:30.616 --> 46:34.085
bring much comfort
to our punisher.

46:34.120 --> 46:38.590
He seems a different man
when he is near you.

46:38.624 --> 46:40.592
Yes.

46:40.626 --> 46:43.928
I would like to be the one
to tell Master Gawain.

46:44.963 --> 46:46.931
Good night, my lady.

46:46.965 --> 46:49.133
Good night,
Chamberlain.

47:02.981 --> 47:05.783
Chamberlain.

47:34.845 --> 47:36.846
(receding footsteps)

47:46.290 --> 47:48.691
(door opens)

48:02.906 --> 48:06.308
I spoke to our chamberlain.

48:06.342 --> 48:10.012
Yea, our mission
found its proper course.

48:10.046 --> 48:11.980
Sir Gaveston will
no longer plague our shire.

48:12.015 --> 48:14.216
Or any shire.

48:16.052 --> 48:20.055
I am so relieved you have
returned unharmed, Wilkin.

48:20.090 --> 48:22.191
As I am relieved
no more harm

48:22.225 --> 48:24.426
has scratched
its way at you, my Love.

48:24.460 --> 48:26.928
(both laugh)

48:28.363 --> 48:30.665
She sleeps
quite peacefully.

48:30.699 --> 48:33.401
Yes.

48:33.435 --> 48:36.404
She has come to accept
the truth of her husband.

48:36.438 --> 48:38.406
How?

48:38.440 --> 48:41.275
I've tried for months
to break through to her.

48:44.179 --> 48:46.147
I have promised
the wife of Maddox

48:46.181 --> 48:49.383
that I will provide for her
and her children.

48:51.185 --> 48:54.855
But the priest and the boy
are nowhere to be found.

48:54.889 --> 48:58.659
It appears they have been
gone for nearly two days.

48:58.693 --> 49:01.227
And Ruskin gave
no word of it?

49:01.262 --> 49:03.864
No.

49:05.900 --> 49:08.835
If she wakes to find
the boy still gone,

49:08.870 --> 49:11.838
she will think
I have deceived her, Wilkin.

49:11.873 --> 49:15.676
It will shatter
her fragile state of calm.

49:15.710 --> 49:18.244
Annora.

49:18.279 --> 49:19.846
The priest was with her
at the North Coves.

49:19.881 --> 49:22.082
- The healer?
- Mm.

49:22.116 --> 49:24.517
Why was the priest
with Annora?

49:24.552 --> 49:27.420
A story that has yet
to be told to me.

49:29.923 --> 49:32.892
Fear not, my Love.

49:32.926 --> 49:35.428
We will find them.

49:56.682 --> 49:59.951
(Lock speaking indistinctly)

49:59.986 --> 50:02.287
And he was...

50:02.322 --> 50:04.823
(muffled indistinct chatter)

50:07.059 --> 50:09.060
(child crying)

50:35.120 --> 50:37.388
I was in haste to come see you
at the coves.

50:37.422 --> 50:39.357
Yes.

50:39.391 --> 50:41.692
About the priest
and the boy.

50:41.726 --> 50:43.361
What do you know?

50:43.395 --> 50:45.395
They were taken.

50:49.400 --> 50:51.669
Because of me.

50:51.703 --> 50:54.872
Because of you?

50:54.906 --> 50:57.808
Sit, Wilkin.

50:57.842 --> 51:01.145
There are things

51:01.179 --> 51:02.813
that you are not still
ready to learn.

51:02.847 --> 51:04.815
I don't need your lessons!

51:04.849 --> 51:06.349
Who took them?

51:07.919 --> 51:10.054
- Where is Luca?
- I do not know.

51:10.088 --> 51:11.055
Sit, Wilkin.

51:11.089 --> 51:12.355
I do not need to sit

51:12.390 --> 51:14.256
and listen
to another parable, woman.

51:14.291 --> 51:16.358
This is not about
my damned holy destiny.

51:16.393 --> 51:18.027
I did not
know the boy

51:18.062 --> 51:19.028
was with the priest.

51:19.063 --> 51:20.396
Oh, you did not know?

51:20.430 --> 51:21.864
The all-seeing healer?

51:21.899 --> 51:23.032
You didn't know I'd be

51:23.067 --> 51:25.201
slicing heads and noses.

51:25.235 --> 51:27.236
Spilling blood by the buckets.

51:27.270 --> 51:30.406
Turning stout men
into crying girls

51:30.440 --> 51:33.375
by the pain of hideous devices.

51:33.410 --> 51:35.544
Please do not howl at me
with such anger!

51:35.579 --> 51:38.081
I will howl like a devil!

51:44.453 --> 51:47.723
For I am weighed
in unforgivable sins.

51:52.261 --> 51:55.897
Wilkin.

52:00.436 --> 52:04.405
And they are all on your head.

52:04.440 --> 52:08.576
You are the devil,
Annora of the Alders.

52:12.248 --> 52:14.882
Please.

52:14.916 --> 52:16.917
Wil-Wilkin, no!

52:16.952 --> 52:19.254
My son.
