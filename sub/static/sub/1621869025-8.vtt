10:57.240 --> 10:59.659
Your little sister had
a fight with your mom, too?

10:59.659 --> 11:00.994
We're not going back there.

11:00.994 --> 11:03.372
The cops can't make us.

11:03.372 --> 11:05.290
I'm 17.

11:05.290 --> 11:07.250
And my mom had me
when she was 17.

11:07.250 --> 11:11.713
And I can do a way better job
with Lily than she can, so...

11:11.713 --> 11:13.799
Even working 30 hours for me

11:13.799 --> 11:17.302
and soon enough
going to school full-time?

11:21.640 --> 11:23.642
You withdrew, didn't you?

11:23.642 --> 11:25.727
I didn't even really want
to be an accountant, so...

11:25.727 --> 11:28.855
- [laughs softly]
- Sorry I made you cover for us.

11:28.855 --> 11:31.650
- Cover for you?
- She thinks that you offered

11:31.650 --> 11:34.694
to let us stay here with you.

11:34.694 --> 11:37.739
Well, I am offering.

11:37.739 --> 11:39.366
In fact, I'm insisting.

11:39.366 --> 11:41.159
I've got three spare bedrooms.

11:41.159 --> 11:43.495
Lord knows I could use
the company.

11:46.331 --> 11:47.582
Thank you.

11:59.469 --> 12:00.679
Sorry about that.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.140
There was only one beer left.

12:05.142 --> 12:07.144
You might have others fooled.

12:09.521 --> 12:10.689
[sniffs]

12:13.108 --> 12:14.818
I know the real you.

12:21.575 --> 12:24.661
- [panting]
- Go on. Hit me.

12:24.661 --> 12:26.913
Prove me right.

12:26.913 --> 12:28.665
Hit me, asshole.

12:32.919 --> 12:34.963
I know what you're doing.

12:34.963 --> 12:37.507
You're trying to get me
in trouble.

12:37.507 --> 12:39.092
You don't need my help for that.

12:43.346 --> 12:45.056
Now come on and hit me,
you piece of shit.

12:45.056 --> 12:46.933
Why, so you can go and tell
your daddy about it?

12:46.933 --> 12:48.268
Yeah, maybe he might
give you some pointers.

12:49.519 --> 12:51.021
Your aim was a little low.

12:56.193 --> 12:58.195
I know what you
and Luke are up to.

12:59.237 --> 13:00.906
You don't know shit.

13:00.906 --> 13:03.283
I know Luke's running bets
on Panic and you're in on it.

13:03.283 --> 13:04.784
Fixing the game
like your brother did last year.

13:04.784 --> 13:07.120
If I was fixing the game,
I'd be winning.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.955
Now get the fuck out of here
before you hurt yourself.

13:08.955 --> 13:10.540
You know,
someone's gonna come down

13:10.540 --> 13:12.751
on Luke for what he did
to Dodge's sister.

13:14.002 --> 13:15.420
Whoa.

13:17.422 --> 13:20.175
- Dodge's sister?
- Yeah, tell me something.

13:20.175 --> 13:22.969
What kind of animal leaves
a girl on the road like that?

13:22.969 --> 13:25.222
What are you talking about?

13:25.222 --> 13:29.351
She's gonna be in a wheelchair
for the rest of her life, Ray.

13:29.351 --> 13:31.770
But I guess that's just
the Hall family way, huh?

13:31.770 --> 13:33.813
Leave a girl in the road to die?

13:33.813 --> 13:35.273
Run, drive?

13:35.273 --> 13:37.275
When the fire was burning
at the Graybill House,

13:37.275 --> 13:38.485
did you run?

13:38.485 --> 13:40.153
Or did you stand there
and watch,

13:40.153 --> 13:42.364
while you knew Heather
was trapped inside?

13:44.407 --> 13:46.826
Let me guess.

13:46.826 --> 13:49.329
You would've walked through fire
to get her, huh?

13:50.413 --> 13:52.415
Through hell.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.837
You probably would've
pulled it off, too.

14:02.676 --> 14:04.678
That's the difference
between you and me.

14:06.096 --> 14:08.807
One of us makes it all the way
to the finish line,

14:08.807 --> 14:11.601
the other one fucking chokes.

14:15.438 --> 14:17.440
Come clean about
what Luke is doing

14:17.440 --> 14:19.442
and maybe Cortez
won't come down on you, too.

14:20.485 --> 14:22.862
[laughs]

14:22.862 --> 14:24.990
I have a question.

14:24.990 --> 14:26.700
When you, uh,
sat down to write out

14:26.700 --> 14:29.619
this little story of yours,

14:29.619 --> 14:31.246
did it ever bother you
that the whole thing

14:31.246 --> 14:33.248
was a complete cliché?

14:33.248 --> 14:34.499
If you want to go to prison
with your brother,

14:34.499 --> 14:36.751
be my fucking guest.
Call it a family reunion.

14:36.751 --> 14:38.003
See? That.

14:38.003 --> 14:40.130
That right there.

14:40.130 --> 14:41.923
Cliché.

14:41.923 --> 14:44.759
You know what your problem is?

14:46.720 --> 14:49.431
You could be walking
with a blindfold on,

14:49.431 --> 14:52.809
staring at the pictures
that are going on in your head,

14:52.809 --> 14:54.519
and you'd be convinced

14:54.519 --> 14:56.938
that your eyes
were wide the fuck open.

14:56.938 --> 14:59.190
You got to know
what to be afraid of,

14:59.190 --> 15:00.817
when to be afraid of it,

15:00.817 --> 15:02.652
and you got to know
the difference.

15:02.652 --> 15:07.490
Every decision's dangerous
when you're wearing a blindfold.

15:07.490 --> 15:10.785
That's why I went for the yellow
in the last challenge.

15:10.785 --> 15:12.662
Shit was straight see-through.

15:12.662 --> 15:14.539
[thumps]

15:16.249 --> 15:18.251
Confidence will kill you
if you're walking blind.

15:25.050 --> 15:26.635
[gasps] Oh, my God.

15:26.635 --> 15:28.511
[cries softly]

15:28.511 --> 15:31.389
Hey. You're in a good mood.

15:31.389 --> 15:34.976
Uh, I just got an e-mail
from that coach.

15:34.976 --> 15:38.063
- What coach?
- The one Anne told Mom about?

15:38.063 --> 15:40.857
The one who specializes
in physical disabilities?

15:40.857 --> 15:44.778
He thinks I could be in
competition shape by next year.

15:44.778 --> 15:47.781
His last client won the barrel
racing championship series

15:47.781 --> 15:49.115
- at Oneworld.
- [chuckles]

15:50.158 --> 15:52.577
Dayna, it's-it's crazy.

15:52.577 --> 15:54.496
How are you gonna
stay on a horse?

15:54.496 --> 15:57.374
You're gonna get knocked off
before you even get to the gate.

15:57.374 --> 15:59.918
- I thought you'd be
happy for me.
- I...

16:00.960 --> 16:03.004
It's too dangerous.

16:03.004 --> 16:04.589
[scoffs]

16:04.589 --> 16:07.217
You are hardly the one
to lecture me about danger,

16:07.217 --> 16:10.970
- all right?
- I am playing Panic
because of what happened.

16:12.472 --> 16:15.141
[exhales]
Ever since we moved here,

16:15.141 --> 16:17.018
it's been about what happened.

16:17.018 --> 16:18.895
Getting justice
for what happened

16:18.895 --> 16:20.980
and making things right
after what happened.

16:20.980 --> 16:23.608
As if they can be fixed
or undone.

16:23.608 --> 16:26.403
As if they can un-happen.

16:26.403 --> 16:31.491
You know, the funny thing is,
the closer we get to justice,

16:31.491 --> 16:33.201
the less I care
about getting it.

16:33.201 --> 16:34.953
Dayna, Luke ruined your life.

16:35.995 --> 16:39.207
No, he didn't.

16:39.207 --> 16:40.625
That's what I'm trying
to tell you.

16:40.625 --> 16:43.712
He ruined a life
that never happened.

16:46.548 --> 16:48.133
Sorry you can't stand
the one that did.

16:48.133 --> 16:49.509
Come on, that is so unfair.

16:49.509 --> 16:50.969
That's not what I'm saying.
Hey, Dayna!

16:50.969 --> 16:53.805
[Dayna] There's mail
for you on the table.

17:17.620 --> 17:19.789
Are you fucking serious?

17:21.249 --> 17:24.794
- He just got clean.
- I'm not here for Hunt,
Shawna.

17:24.794 --> 17:26.963
- Then why are you here?
- For you.

17:26.963 --> 17:30.216
I'll be running
your challenge. Look.

17:30.216 --> 17:32.010
Courtesy of the judges.

17:32.010 --> 17:33.636
I'll see you tonight.

17:45.815 --> 17:48.193

[gun clicks]

19:57.113 --> 19:58.656
[Williams] Hunt, Leela.

19:58.656 --> 20:01.576
Appreciate you coming in
to talk to us.

20:01.576 --> 20:04.746
- You feeling better?
- The first night was the worst.

20:04.746 --> 20:06.289
I thought I might die.

20:06.289 --> 20:08.333
We drove all the way
to the clinic

20:08.333 --> 20:10.376
and then they told us
that there were no beds left.

20:10.376 --> 20:11.794
- Hmm.
- So...

20:11.794 --> 20:15.924
Hunt decided cold turkey.

20:15.924 --> 20:17.675
Good for you.

20:17.675 --> 20:20.303
I should've never lied
about last year.

20:20.303 --> 20:22.555
I'm sorry, I was
all sorts of fucked up.

20:24.557 --> 20:26.559
I was worried you'd think
that I had something to do

20:26.559 --> 20:27.644
with what happened.

20:28.686 --> 20:29.812
Did you?

20:30.855 --> 20:32.357
I-I wanted to win,

20:32.357 --> 20:34.901
but I didn't need
the money that bad.

20:34.901 --> 20:38.988
I didn't even start using
until after Jimmy.

20:40.031 --> 20:41.866
What about Luke Hall?

20:45.411 --> 20:46.829
Did he need the money?

20:46.829 --> 20:49.290
Luke wasn't playing.
He couldn't.

20:49.290 --> 20:51.000
- He wasn't a senior.
- Yeah,

20:51.000 --> 20:52.335
but he was betting
on the game, wasn't he?

20:52.335 --> 20:54.253
- Plenty of people place bets.
- Yeah, they do.

20:54.253 --> 20:55.463
How many guarantee 'em?

20:55.463 --> 20:57.006
What do you mean?

20:57.006 --> 20:59.133
Jimmy brought a training pistol
to Russian roulette

20:59.133 --> 21:00.593
and then someone switched it out

21:00.593 --> 21:02.136
with a real gun
at the last minute.

21:04.555 --> 21:08.685
Luke paid another player
to drop out last year.

21:08.685 --> 21:10.478
Maybe he thought
that it was just easier

21:10.478 --> 21:11.980
to get rid of the competition.

21:14.357 --> 21:17.318
Well, if he did, I never heard
anything about it.

21:17.318 --> 21:19.070
I wasn't looking for help,
either. I...

21:19.070 --> 21:20.655
Remember, I was second

21:20.655 --> 21:22.240
- going on in Final Four.
- [Langley] Okay.

21:22.240 --> 21:24.075
So it was Jimmy,
and then it was you,

21:24.075 --> 21:25.410
and then it was...

21:26.661 --> 21:28.413
Then Shay,

21:28.413 --> 21:29.789
then Myra was last.

21:29.789 --> 21:31.416
My-Myra Campbell?

21:33.501 --> 21:35.294
She was pissed
that Abby was playing,

21:35.294 --> 21:37.005
and she was the only one

21:37.005 --> 21:38.673
that could have written
all those notes to Abby.

21:40.091 --> 21:41.342
Notes?

21:41.342 --> 21:43.803
Threats.

21:43.803 --> 21:46.639
You know, "get out of the game
or else"-type shit.

21:46.639 --> 21:48.891
Yeah, her-her mom mentioned
that she was getting

21:48.891 --> 21:49.934
threatening letters,
but I couldn't verify it.

21:49.934 --> 21:51.060
Who told you that?

21:53.146 --> 21:54.397
I did.

21:54.397 --> 21:57.608
Last year, I volunteered
for the Salvation Army.

21:57.608 --> 21:59.902
The library donated bins

21:59.902 --> 22:02.196
from the lost and found,
and I guess

22:02.196 --> 22:05.908
Abby's dance bag got dumped in
with the rest of the stuff.

22:11.039 --> 22:13.291
I knew I couldn't
throw them out.

22:13.291 --> 22:15.835
But it didn't feel right
passing them on

22:15.835 --> 22:20.256
when she wanted to keep
everything private.

22:20.256 --> 22:22.550
From what I know,

22:22.550 --> 22:25.720
she and Jimmy never told anybody
about the baby.

22:28.347 --> 22:30.266
[Langley] The baby?

22:31.559 --> 22:33.895
"Follow the rules
and you won't get hurt."

22:33.895 --> 22:35.313
"Aren't you afraid
your mother will find out

22:35.313 --> 22:38.066
how her good little girl
is a liar?"

22:39.650 --> 22:41.360
Mary Clark was right.

22:41.360 --> 22:43.362
Someone was blackmailing Abby
to get her out of the game.

22:43.362 --> 22:45.573
But Myra Campbell,
she was in last place

22:45.573 --> 22:47.408
and she was close
to Luke Hall and I'm...

22:47.408 --> 22:49.410
I can't,
I can't think of anyone else

22:49.410 --> 22:53.247
besides Jimmy that could write
these notes, because...

22:53.247 --> 22:56.250
well, some of them are
extremely personal.

23:00.296 --> 23:01.964
[Cortez] "Tomorrow
everyone will know

23:01.964 --> 23:02.965
you're a whore.

23:02.965 --> 23:04.550
If you don't quit,

23:04.550 --> 23:07.345
they'll know
you killed the baby."

35:55.821 --> 35:57.698
There's no way she's gonna win.

35:57.698 --> 35:59.950
What am I watching?

35:59.950 --> 36:01.702
- She never finishes
her stories.
- Just...

36:01.702 --> 36:03.787
And if even if she does,
she won't do anything with them.

36:03.787 --> 36:05.289
She never even applied
to college.

36:05.289 --> 36:06.874
- This isn't true, right?
- As soon as she has a chance

36:06.874 --> 36:08.500
of actually getting
what she wants...

36:08.500 --> 36:10.127
Please, can you just
let me explain?

36:10.127 --> 36:11.587
This isn't real.

36:11.587 --> 36:13.672
'Cause you wouldn't say
those things about me.

36:13.672 --> 36:15.716
- No... no...
- Like this, right?

36:15.716 --> 36:16.884
[Diggins] Then why bother
making a deal

36:16.884 --> 36:18.510
with her in the first place?

36:18.510 --> 36:21.013
'Cause otherwise...

36:21.013 --> 36:23.181
she would know
I was competing against her.

36:23.181 --> 36:25.309
- She wouldn't trust me.
- Okay... stop it!

36:25.309 --> 36:28.770
- After she made the Jump...
- Stop it, we get it! Stop it!

36:28.770 --> 36:32.065
Stop, okay? We get it. Stop!

36:32.065 --> 36:34.902
[Diggins] So you sabotaged her?

36:34.902 --> 36:37.529
- What did you do, Natalie?
- [Natalie] To keep her
from getting too far ahead.

36:37.529 --> 36:38.572
[crying]

36:38.572 --> 36:40.574
I mean, I was sure I...

36:40.574 --> 36:42.159
had her at Spurlock's ranch.

36:42.159 --> 36:45.162
I saw her go underground.

36:45.162 --> 36:47.497
I thought if I...

36:47.497 --> 36:49.875
locked her in, then...

36:49.875 --> 36:52.461
she wouldn't get into the house.

36:52.461 --> 36:54.671
That's what I mean
about Heather.

36:56.548 --> 36:58.467
Nobody else can stop her.

36:58.467 --> 37:01.553
But... nobody else has to.

37:03.639 --> 37:05.265
[Natalie crying]

37:11.521 --> 37:14.274
Heather... Heather...

37:19.655 --> 37:21.740
- Heather?
- You okay?

37:23.492 --> 37:25.577
- Heather!
- Natalie, Natalie,
just breathe, okay?

37:25.577 --> 37:26.954
- Where is she going?
- Just give her some space.

37:26.954 --> 37:29.081
You fucking asshole!
You fucking asshole!

37:29.081 --> 37:30.040
I had no choice.

37:31.208 --> 37:34.127
[crying]

37:34.127 --> 37:35.337
[Heather] Once upon a time,

37:35.337 --> 37:37.089
there was a girl
made of stories,

37:37.089 --> 37:39.841
who didn't have
anything to believe in.

37:59.528 --> 38:01.530
- [phone ringing]
- [indistinct chatter]

38:08.328 --> 38:10.330
Sergeant Langley.

38:10.330 --> 38:11.957
Melanie?

38:11.957 --> 38:14.001
Um, your husband's
not here right now.

38:14.001 --> 38:15.460
- He stepped out for a...
- I know.

38:15.460 --> 38:17.004
Do you have a minute?

38:17.004 --> 38:19.464
Yeah.

38:19.464 --> 38:21.341
You all right?

38:21.341 --> 38:23.468
Jimmy switched the gun.

38:23.468 --> 38:25.095
My husband said
someone had switched

38:25.095 --> 38:26.680
the gun at roulette last year.

38:26.680 --> 38:29.433
But it was Jimmy
who switched the gun himself.

38:32.811 --> 38:34.938
[birds chirping]

38:34.938 --> 38:37.232
Friends, players,

38:37.232 --> 38:39.818
former contestants, the results

38:39.818 --> 38:41.528
of the individual challenges
have been tallied.

38:41.528 --> 38:43.655
All the points have been scored.

38:43.655 --> 38:45.741
Shawna quit,
so she's out of the game.

38:45.741 --> 38:47.451
Dodge is in first place

38:47.451 --> 38:48.744
and will be heading
to the Joust.

38:48.744 --> 38:50.328
The player competing

38:50.328 --> 38:51.913
against him is as yet

38:51.913 --> 38:53.081
undetermined.

38:53.081 --> 38:55.333
What?! Why?

38:55.333 --> 38:58.378
I mean, I stayed long enough in
that shithole cooler, didn't I?

38:58.378 --> 39:00.589
[Summer] Not long enough
to beat Dodge's time.

39:00.589 --> 39:02.841
The individual challenges
aren't done yet, Ray.

39:02.841 --> 39:05.719
By order of the judges,
Natalie Williams is disqualified

39:05.719 --> 39:08.388
for reasons
of false representation

39:08.388 --> 39:10.974
and failure to complete
the required challenges.

39:10.974 --> 39:12.517
As punishment,
the player's points

39:12.517 --> 39:14.436
have been
retroactively invalidated.

39:14.436 --> 39:17.022
[scoffs] In English?

39:17.022 --> 39:19.775
The judges wiped Natalie's score
because she cheated.

39:19.775 --> 39:21.777
- [Ray laughs]
- [others murmuring]

39:21.777 --> 39:23.904
[Diggins] She was never
in Spurlock's house.

39:23.904 --> 39:25.405
Shouldn't have even made it
to Graybill,

39:25.405 --> 39:26.698
let alone the Final Four.

39:26.698 --> 39:29.159
That's... that's bullshit.

39:29.159 --> 39:30.702
All right, that's hearsay.

39:30.702 --> 39:32.788
True. We heard you say it.

39:32.788 --> 39:34.164
That's a good one, Summer.

39:34.164 --> 39:35.540
[Heather] No, you admitted it

39:35.540 --> 39:37.334
in your video
that you trapped me underground.

39:39.336 --> 39:41.546
That's nowhere
near the house, right?

39:41.546 --> 39:44.382
Plus someone ratted you out
to the judges.

39:44.382 --> 39:46.510
- [murmuring]
- [gasping]

39:46.510 --> 39:48.011
All right, fuck you guys.

39:48.011 --> 39:50.388
[Diggins] You were
outside watching the house.

39:50.388 --> 39:51.890
Dodge covered for you.

39:51.890 --> 39:54.476
[Ray] Wait, hold on, hold on,
hold on... wait a second.

39:54.476 --> 39:56.686
If Dodge helped Natalie get
through the last challenge,

39:56.686 --> 39:57.896
then why is he still playing?

39:57.896 --> 39:59.773
Well, he was stealing for two.

39:59.773 --> 40:01.525
Lucky he didn't get
double the points.

40:01.525 --> 40:04.319
- True.
- What the fuck?

40:04.319 --> 40:06.279
[Diggins] All right,
settle down, settle down.

40:06.279 --> 40:09.324
At the time of the judges'
selection of the Final Three,

40:09.324 --> 40:12.994
excluding Natalie,
the players in order

40:12.994 --> 40:14.704
were Dodge...

40:14.704 --> 40:16.790
Ray...

40:16.790 --> 40:18.583
and Heather.

40:19.668 --> 40:20.836
But Heather missed a challenge.

40:20.836 --> 40:22.921
Well, she still has
her immunity.

40:22.921 --> 40:25.507
[Diggins] Given that
and Natalie's disqualification,

40:25.507 --> 40:27.425
an exception has been made.

40:27.425 --> 40:28.969
Congratulations, Heather.

40:28.969 --> 40:32.222
The judges ruled you may move on
to your individual challenge.

40:34.266 --> 40:35.934
