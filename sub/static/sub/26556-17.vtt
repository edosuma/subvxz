Hey. Laurel has changed a lot.

11:32.495 --> 11:33.630
I mean, she's been a
really good friend to me...

11:33.632 --> 11:35.782
Not to say that your sister's
evil, but she's changed a lot.

Circle is clearly a threat,

every lead that we have.

stole 8 military-grade drones,

11:43.153 --> 11:45.394

planning to do anything with.

pinpoint Dante's location?

A.R.G.U.S.'s databases.

12:30.625 --> 12:32.366

12:32.368 --> 12:34.461
who was ready to nail him
for criminal conspiracy

12:34.463 --> 12:38.417
until we found out his
confession was coerced by the D.A.

You wanted the city cleaned up, right?

You know, with Team Arrow
working alongside the SCPD,

12:49.627 --> 12:51.955
this city has a real chance
of turning things around,

12:51.958 --> 12:55.965
and it's never gonna happen
if our D.A. is a criminal.

12:55.967 --> 12:58.676

out what you've been up to,

off on technicalities,

13:10.481 --> 13:12.481

walked out on me and my mother.

Those drones are airborne,
