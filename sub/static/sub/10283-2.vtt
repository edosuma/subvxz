WEBVTT

00:04.838 --> 00:06.774
Previously on ER:

00:06.774 --> 00:09.543
Don't go away mad, Jake.
But do go away.

00:09.543 --> 00:15.316
I don't want to have
any more kids. I'm done.

00:15.316 --> 00:17.351
You're responsible
for every thing an intern does,

00:17.351 --> 00:19.453
but you question history
and they get testy.

00:19.453 --> 00:21.289
Sounds like
you had a great day.

00:21.289 --> 00:25.093
You told me to step it up.
Yeah, but it's not moving meat.

00:25.093 --> 00:26.327
You're a resident now.

00:26.327 --> 00:27.761
Your name is Charlie Pratt?

00:27.761 --> 00:30.398
Chas? Who is it?

00:31.599 --> 00:33.134
Is there a problem?

00:33.134 --> 00:35.103
Are you Charlie?

00:35.103 --> 00:36.437
Yeah, I'm Charlie.

00:43.144 --> 00:44.378
Aw!

00:49.183 --> 00:52.586
Is Alex still here?
Uh, no, he just left, why?

00:55.256 --> 00:57.225
You're up early.

00:58.759 --> 01:01.395
Yep.

01:01.395 --> 01:05.132
Everything okay?
Ah, just couldn't sleep.

01:07.168 --> 01:09.403
Uh, I've been thinking about...

01:09.403 --> 01:11.472
( phone ringing )

01:11.472 --> 01:12.473
Hello.

01:13.507 --> 01:15.209
This is Sam.

01:15.776 --> 01:18.179
Yes, I did.

01:18.179 --> 01:19.213
Uh-huh.

01:20.348 --> 01:21.482
When?

01:22.683 --> 01:24.252
Okay, sure.

01:24.252 --> 01:26.754
If I come in 20 minutes,
will someone be there?

01:26.754 --> 01:28.456
Great.

01:28.456 --> 01:30.424
Okay, thank you.

01:34.162 --> 01:36.497
Sorry. What were you saying?

01:36.497 --> 01:38.666
My father's been bugging me
to visit him.

01:38.666 --> 01:40.901
I haven't been home
in a long time and,

01:40.901 --> 01:42.536
I have some vacation
coming up,

01:42.536 --> 01:46.507
so I was thinking about making
a trip back to Croatia.

01:46.507 --> 01:49.743
It would only be for
a couple of weeks.

01:49.743 --> 01:52.846
Might be good for us
if we spent some time apart.

01:52.846 --> 01:56.350
Alex and you can hang out
and you know...

01:56.350 --> 01:58.586
I already started looking
for a new place.

02:00.188 --> 02:02.323
A new place?
For me and Alex.

02:03.624 --> 02:05.359
You're moving out?

02:05.359 --> 02:07.795
You just said it'd be good
to spend time apart.

02:07.795 --> 02:10.431
That's not what I meant.
I was gonna tell you.

02:10.431 --> 02:12.366
I just think that it's...

02:12.366 --> 02:14.435
I need to think things out
by myself.

02:14.435 --> 02:16.237
Where you going now?

02:16.237 --> 02:18.272
I'm gonna look at an
apartment before work.

02:18.272 --> 02:20.508
So what, that's it?
We don't talk about this?

02:20.508 --> 02:22.510
Never seemed to do us
any good before.

02:25.413 --> 02:27.348
Did he really?

02:27.348 --> 02:30.384
God. You've gotta tell me later.
Okay, I've got to go. Bye.

02:32.286 --> 02:33.687
LOCKHART:
Hey, wait!

02:33.687 --> 02:36.424
Wait, wait, hey.
Can you hold the doors?

02:36.424 --> 02:39.360
Hey, can you hold the doors?

02:42.696 --> 02:44.232
Thank you.

02:45.833 --> 02:46.867
Hey.

02:46.867 --> 02:47.901
Hi.

02:47.901 --> 02:48.936
Good morning.

02:48.936 --> 02:50.638
Well, maybe for you.

02:50.638 --> 02:52.273
I was up writing a paper

02:52.273 --> 02:54.408
on paint ball injuries
for Morris.

02:56.477 --> 02:58.612
Are they talking about us?

03:03.451 --> 03:04.918
Can we help you?

03:04.918 --> 03:07.488
We were just wondering
where you got your shoes.

03:07.488 --> 03:09.457
They look very comfortable.

03:11.525 --> 03:13.727
They match
your backpack.

03:19.267 --> 03:22.270
Just ignore them.

03:22.270 --> 03:24.738
They're on a bulimia high.

03:24.738 --> 03:27.375
I don't understand what he said,
he was like, oh...

03:27.375 --> 03:28.909
Oh, my God.

03:28.909 --> 03:30.344
Are you okay?
My foot.

03:30.344 --> 03:32.480
Can you stand on it?
No.

03:32.480 --> 03:34.348
Oh, call 911.

03:34.348 --> 03:36.550
Should we check her out?
No.

03:39.019 --> 03:40.854
( groans )

03:40.854 --> 03:42.856
Don't... touch me.

03:42.856 --> 03:46.327
Try not to move. I'm a doctor.
You may have broken your ankle.

03:46.327 --> 03:49.763
If you're a doctor,
I want a second opinion.

03:49.763 --> 03:52.500
Dr. Lockhart, would you care
to give a second opinion?

03:52.500 --> 03:55.969
Sure. Your ankle may be broken
and you're a bitch.

03:57.000 --> 04:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:47.588 --> 04:49.357
MORRIS:
All three are a liability.

04:49.357 --> 04:51.392
Look at them. Huddled together
like a bunch of prairie dogs.

04:51.392 --> 04:52.826
This is the best we have?

04:52.826 --> 04:54.762
They should've made me chief.

04:54.762 --> 04:55.896
And why's that?

04:55.896 --> 04:57.365
For one, I would've been

04:57.365 --> 04:58.966
a little pickier
in choosing our residents.

04:58.966 --> 05:01.068
What are you saying?
Abby, Ray, Neela.

05:01.068 --> 05:04.705
No brain, no courage, no heart.
They is to see the wizard.

05:04.705 --> 05:06.374
And who's the wizard, you?

05:06.374 --> 05:08.442
That's why they pay me
the big bucks.

05:08.442 --> 05:10.878
Officer on deck.

05:10.878 --> 05:13.647
Me. I'm the chief.
Yeah, Chief Pain in the Ass.

05:13.647 --> 05:17.585
Ha, ha. Abby, if only you were
as talented as you are funny.

05:17.585 --> 05:18.952
At least I'm funny.

05:18.952 --> 05:20.988
If making jokes
at the expense of those

05:20.988 --> 05:23.791
with Native American heritage
is humorous to you.

05:23.791 --> 05:26.059
Yeah, I happen to be
1/16th Choktaw Indian.

05:26.059 --> 05:28.762
Hey, Jake sent us a postcard
from San Francisco.

05:28.762 --> 05:31.732
Right on.
How's he doing, Abby?

05:31.732 --> 05:33.066
Great.

05:33.066 --> 05:35.135
I think he really
likes it there.

05:35.135 --> 05:37.538
Yeah, well, not according
to this.

05:37.538 --> 05:39.473
KOVAC:
Guys, you know our new interns?

05:39.473 --> 05:41.575
Clemens, Munson and Babinski.

05:41.575 --> 05:43.811
Abby, Neela and Ray.
They'll show you the ropes.

05:43.811 --> 05:46.847
I'm Dr. Morris, but everybody
calls me chief, because...

05:46.847 --> 05:49.116
Anyone? No?
Well, I'm the chief resident.

05:49.116 --> 05:52.853
You present to the residents,
they present to Pratt and me.

05:52.853 --> 05:55.756
And they present
to the attending.
That's a lot of presenting.

05:55.756 --> 05:59.026
Dr. Kovac, do you have
a patient in the cath lab?
Yeah, why?

05:59.026 --> 06:01.529
I think he might have died.

06:01.529 --> 06:05.533
If you'll come to the board,
I'll show you how I like
things around here.

06:05.533 --> 06:07.968
Applies to you three as well.
I'm implementing some changes.

06:07.968 --> 06:10.438
I'd like to stick
an implement in his eye.

06:10.438 --> 06:12.039
Pick a number
one through ten.
Why?

06:12.039 --> 06:14.475
Neela?
Seven.

06:14.475 --> 06:15.576
Four.

06:15.576 --> 06:17.077
Oh, so close.
It was six.

06:17.077 --> 06:19.112
Neela gets to choose between
Munson and Babinski.

06:19.112 --> 06:20.147
Babinski.
Wait a minute.

06:20.147 --> 06:21.482
TAGGART:
Who's up?

06:21.482 --> 06:23.016
Clemens, you're with me.
I am?

06:23.016 --> 06:25.819
I trust you, girl.
Just don't let me down.

06:25.819 --> 06:27.921
Claire Jansen, 24,
unrestrained driver,

06:27.921 --> 06:29.457
rear-ended at
moderate velocity.

06:29.457 --> 06:30.791
Term pregnancy,
good vitals.

06:30.791 --> 06:32.526
Definitely having contractions.

06:32.526 --> 06:33.994
Fetal heart rate
looks good-- 160.

06:33.994 --> 06:36.597
Okay, any pain when I push?

06:36.597 --> 06:37.698
Not now.

06:37.698 --> 06:39.900
Hemocue is 14.1.
Pretty normal.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.535
I don't think you're
bleeding internally.

06:41.535 --> 06:43.904
I should hope not.
I think my water broke.

06:43.904 --> 06:46.139
Premature rupture
of membranes.
Is that bad?

06:46.139 --> 06:49.209
No, but there's a good chance
you could have your baby today.

06:49.209 --> 06:51.745
Oh, I wanted to have another
home birth.

06:51.745 --> 06:52.846
Your second pregnancy?

06:52.846 --> 06:54.682
Yeah. Zoe's two.

06:54.682 --> 06:55.816
This one's a boy.

06:55.816 --> 06:57.485
Want me to call your husband?

06:57.485 --> 06:58.819
No, there's no such creature.

06:58.819 --> 07:01.088
But you could call
Toni Stillman.

07:01.088 --> 07:03.657
She's my friend.
She needs to be here.

07:03.657 --> 07:05.125
Ray?

07:05.125 --> 07:08.662
24-year-old G2P1, 39 weeks
"prommed" after a TC.

07:08.662 --> 07:10.130
Normal vitals and crit.

07:10.130 --> 07:14.502
Ultrasound and send her up
to OB for a sterile spec exam.

07:15.969 --> 07:17.971
Do you have a minute?

07:17.971 --> 07:19.940
Uh, no, not really.

07:19.940 --> 07:22.676
I've got to get labs off,
do a cathed UA,

07:22.676 --> 07:25.078
assist Ray with a pelvic,
and find an ultrasound.

07:25.078 --> 07:27.180
Can you do some of this?

07:27.180 --> 07:28.649
Me?

07:28.649 --> 07:29.817
No, she can't.

07:31.018 --> 07:32.853
Uh, sorry, Inez,
this is Dr. Kovac.

07:32.853 --> 07:35.122
I'm helping her get
the lay of the land.

07:35.122 --> 07:37.625
When you're finished?
Sure. Might be a while.

07:40.127 --> 07:43.531
Welcome to County, Inez.
Thank you.

07:43.531 --> 07:45.633
Sit tight, Claire,
you're doing great.

07:45.633 --> 07:47.668
We'll have you upstairs
before you get comfortable.

07:47.668 --> 07:50.270
I feel, it's gonna be several
hours before I'm comfortable.

07:50.270 --> 07:52.840
Okay, Clemens, what's next?
A bimanual exam?

07:52.840 --> 07:54.775
Not before the ultrasound.
Why not?

07:54.775 --> 07:57.678
Third trimester, you've
got to rule out previa
before the exam.

07:57.678 --> 08:01.682
Most important thing in the ER,
is if you don't get it, fake it.

08:01.682 --> 08:03.617
There's no time
to ask questions,

08:03.617 --> 08:05.853
and patients don't wanna
see you scratching your head.

08:05.853 --> 08:08.689
So, in the meantime,
could you get me
some Nitrazine paper?

08:08.689 --> 08:09.957
Come on, go, go.

08:13.727 --> 08:16.564
Excuse me? Dr. Barnett wanted me
to get some Nitrazine paper,

08:16.564 --> 08:18.999
but I don't know what it is.
You didn't ask?

08:18.999 --> 08:21.034
He said if I didn't know
something...
Listen.

08:21.034 --> 08:23.170
The number one rule
of the ER is

08:23.170 --> 08:25.172
if you don't know something,
ask. Okay?

08:25.172 --> 08:27.207
You're never gonna learn
this stuff by yourself.

08:27.207 --> 08:30.177
And that's why we're here.
What do I do with the...?

08:30.177 --> 08:33.246
Dr. Rasgotra, could you
tell me how to use
the Nitrazine paper?

08:33.246 --> 08:36.149
Not until I finish suturing
a very fidgety six-year-old.

08:36.149 --> 08:37.818
You're an intern
now, Clemens.

08:37.818 --> 08:40.053
If you don't know something...
I know, fake it.

08:40.053 --> 08:41.621
What?
No, of course not.

08:41.621 --> 08:44.024
Well, I already asked.
Look things up yourself.

08:44.024 --> 08:46.860
When someone gives you
the answer, you forget
five minutes later.

08:46.860 --> 08:48.662
Read it, and it sticks.

08:48.662 --> 08:50.864
Your primary responsibility
is to educate yourself.

08:50.864 --> 08:54.802
No one else is going
to do it for you.
Thank you.

08:56.837 --> 08:58.739
How's it going?

08:58.739 --> 08:59.740
Fine.

09:00.841 --> 09:01.909
Great.

09:06.714 --> 09:08.716
Do you have any questions?
No.

09:08.716 --> 09:10.350
Terrific.

09:10.350 --> 09:13.220
Uh, anything to present?
I'll let you know.

09:13.220 --> 09:16.156
Okay. Can I make
a suggestion?

09:16.156 --> 09:19.727
Unless your patient
has situs inversus,

09:19.727 --> 09:21.729
her heart should be
on the left.

09:21.729 --> 09:23.931
Tests came back on
the girl in four?

09:23.931 --> 09:26.033
Looks like she's going to
need Amphotericin B.

09:26.033 --> 09:28.035
Your intern picked up
histoplasmosis?

09:28.035 --> 09:31.238
Yeah, he just doesn't
know it yet.
How's he doing?

09:31.238 --> 09:33.240
I don't think he likes me.

09:33.240 --> 09:34.942
Everybody likes you.
Not this guy.

09:34.942 --> 09:37.177
He's acting like I killed
his dog or something.

09:37.177 --> 09:38.712
He's probably just nervous.

09:38.712 --> 09:40.347
I don't think
I'm gonna be great

09:40.347 --> 09:41.782
at this teaching-
the-interns thing.

09:41.782 --> 09:44.017
You will.
You did a great job with Jake.

09:44.017 --> 09:45.853
Too bad he didn't match here.
Yeah.

09:45.853 --> 09:48.121
Dr. Pratt, can you get
on the MICN?

09:48.121 --> 09:50.758
Paramedics need you to pronounce
a GSW in the field.

09:50.758 --> 09:52.059
Sure.

09:56.664 --> 09:58.999
Abby, got one.

09:58.999 --> 10:01.301
Munson, we're up!

10:01.301 --> 10:03.136
Unidentified kid,
looks about ten,

10:03.136 --> 10:06.106
found down in the food court
at City Center Mall.
Munson!

10:06.106 --> 10:07.975
Still hypotensive
after 500 cc's.

10:07.975 --> 10:09.910
Mental status waxing
and waning en route.

10:09.910 --> 10:12.345
Hi, I'm Dr. Lockhart.
Can you tell me your name?

10:12.345 --> 10:14.047
( mumbling )
Is he alone?

10:14.047 --> 10:16.684
With his buddies, but they
split when we got there.

10:16.684 --> 10:18.151
Sats only 92.
What's your plan?

10:18.151 --> 10:19.687
CBC, chem seven, tox screen?

10:19.687 --> 10:20.854
And?

10:20.854 --> 10:22.790
...head CT?
And?

10:22.790 --> 10:24.692
Try to find next of kin.

10:24.692 --> 10:26.093
ABG, LFTs, oxygen,
normal saline,

10:26.093 --> 10:27.895
activated charcoal.
Let's go.

10:27.895 --> 10:31.264
Don't worry, you'll get
the hang of it.
I know.

10:31.264 --> 10:32.933
PRATT:
Okay, 57, I concur,

10:32.933 --> 10:35.168
we can pronounce.
What's the status on number two?

10:35.168 --> 10:38.839
GSW to the chest, 110 palp.
We've got IV, O2
and a nine-minute ETA.

10:38.839 --> 10:41.675
All right, sounds good.
We'll be waiting for you.
County, clear.

10:41.675 --> 10:42.876
Dr. Pratt.
Yeah?

10:42.876 --> 10:45.412
Guy out there says
he knows you.

10:45.412 --> 10:46.714
Which guy?

10:46.714 --> 10:48.682
Sitting next to the old lady.

10:52.786 --> 10:54.888
He a friend of yours?

10:55.989 --> 10:57.457
Not really.

10:57.457 --> 11:01.094
So you want me
to bring him in or no?
No. He can wait.

11:07.801 --> 11:09.236
This is Dr. Pratt.

11:09.236 --> 11:10.938
I'll need one of
these two trauma rooms

11:10.938 --> 11:12.973
in a few minutes.
How are we doing?

11:12.973 --> 11:15.809
I don't know about you,
but I'm having contractions.

11:15.809 --> 11:17.277
Nitrazine is positive.

11:17.277 --> 11:19.279
TAGGART:
Which means your
water did break.

11:19.279 --> 11:20.748
Follow it caudad.

11:22.015 --> 11:23.383
Is everything okay?

11:26.286 --> 11:28.989
Looks like a breech
presentation.

11:28.989 --> 11:31.258
Dr. Barnett, can I get your
advice on something?

11:31.258 --> 11:34.161
This doesn't feel
any different
from my last pregnancy.

11:34.161 --> 11:36.363
The baby's been active.

11:36.363 --> 11:39.432
You're doing good, Claire.
The baby's heart rate
is right on target.

11:39.432 --> 11:40.968
Uh, Dr. Pratt?

11:40.968 --> 11:43.403
Could you come and take
a look at this, please?

11:43.403 --> 11:44.471
Dr. Pratt.

11:46.907 --> 11:48.141
What is it?

11:50.443 --> 11:52.780
Well, it looks like you've
delivered the feet.

11:52.780 --> 11:54.414
But that's okay, right?

11:54.414 --> 11:57.785
I had a friend who
delivered breech
and her baby was okay.

11:57.785 --> 11:59.987
Page OB and get them
down here right now.

11:59.987 --> 12:02.823
Don't worry.
We'll take good care
of you and your baby.

12:02.823 --> 12:04.958
Dr. Kovac,
this is Toni Stillman.

12:04.958 --> 12:08.495
She's here to check on
Claire's condition.
The pregnant MVA.

12:08.495 --> 12:11.799
Somebody called and said
she's had an accident.
Yeah, she was uninjured.

12:11.799 --> 12:14.201
Thank God.
What about the baby?
You're a family friend?

12:14.201 --> 12:16.103
Claire's our
gestational surrogate.

12:16.103 --> 12:18.538
She's living with my husband
and me for six weeks.

12:18.538 --> 12:20.107
She's having your child?

12:20.107 --> 12:22.109
Yes, she's implanted
with our embryo.

12:22.109 --> 12:24.177
So is our baby
going to be okay?

12:24.177 --> 12:27.280
I'm afraid I can't
tell you that.
Not without Claire's consent.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.249
She's carrying my baby.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.151
I'm sorry.
I need the patient's consent.

12:31.151 --> 12:33.186
We're best friends.
She'll want to see me.

12:33.186 --> 12:36.323
Sam, this is
Toni Stillman.
She's a friend of Claire's.

12:36.323 --> 12:38.959
Oh, I spoke with
you on the phone.
I'm Sam.

12:38.959 --> 12:40.994
Come on in, she's been
asking for you.

12:40.994 --> 12:43.096
Sam, how's she doing?

12:43.096 --> 12:44.231
Pretty good.

12:44.231 --> 12:46.366
Uh...
When I get a chance, okay?

12:48.301 --> 12:50.437
I was so worried about you.
I'm fine.

12:50.437 --> 12:53.907
You shouldn't be driving.
I can take you
anywhere you need to go.

12:53.907 --> 12:55.575
It was just
a tiny fender bender.

12:55.575 --> 12:58.011
Sam, you have
activated charcoal here?
Yeah, bottom shelf.

12:58.011 --> 13:00.513
There's a guy
in the waiting room
looking for you.

13:00.513 --> 13:02.983
I know. Thanks, Malik.

13:02.983 --> 13:05.252
( Claire gasps )
Claire? Claire, are you okay?
What's happening?

13:05.252 --> 13:07.420
Another contraction?
What? She, she,
she's in labor?

13:07.420 --> 13:09.456
Yep.
But, but are you gonna stop it?

13:09.456 --> 13:11.324
Because she's not due
for another week.

13:11.324 --> 13:13.994
39 weeks.
Junior here is ready
to make an appearance.

13:13.994 --> 13:16.496
His feet are already
popping out.
His feet? He's breech?

13:16.496 --> 13:19.532
Are you gonna
do a C-section?
We're waiting on OB.

13:19.532 --> 13:21.301
GSW's two minutes out,
Dr. Pratt.

13:21.301 --> 13:24.137
Come find me
when they get here.
You, you're with me.

13:24.137 --> 13:25.906
Go ahead, I got it.

13:25.906 --> 13:28.175
Have you ever
been in a GSW
trauma before?

13:28.175 --> 13:31.078
I grew up in the Bronx.
Dr. Pratt, can we present?

13:31.078 --> 13:32.913
Not now. Got a trauma
rolling in.

13:32.913 --> 13:34.314
Okay, uh, what's next?

13:34.314 --> 13:36.917
Uh, Exam Three,
possible talar fracture.

13:36.917 --> 13:39.552
And I should warn you,
she already took
my head off

13:39.552 --> 13:41.989
for how long
she's had to wait.

13:43.891 --> 13:46.459
Oh, God. Could this
day get any worse?

13:46.459 --> 13:49.096
This is
Drew Filmore.
We've, uh, met.

13:54.201 --> 13:55.335
Greg.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.604
You figured me out, huh?

13:57.604 --> 14:01.341
Five minutes after
you left, I knew it was you.
I can't talk now.

14:01.341 --> 14:04.077
Looks like you're busy.
I am.

14:04.077 --> 14:06.413
What do you want?

14:06.413 --> 14:09.182
I don't know.

14:09.182 --> 14:12.019
What were you looking for
when you came to find me?

14:13.921 --> 14:16.289
I guess I just had
to see for myself.

14:16.289 --> 14:18.258
And now I have.

14:21.528 --> 14:23.530
So how do we do this?

14:23.530 --> 14:25.665
We don't.
I'm sorry I bothered you.

14:25.665 --> 14:29.569
I didn't know you were in
Chicago. Heard you were
still in Detroit.

14:29.569 --> 14:31.438
Yeah, well,
I'm not in Detroit anymore.

14:31.438 --> 14:33.540
I can imagine
what you think about me.

14:33.540 --> 14:36.376
There's a lot of things you
probably need me to explain.

14:36.376 --> 14:39.546
No. I don't need anything
from you.

14:39.546 --> 14:42.182
I never have.
I made a mistake
that night.

14:42.182 --> 14:44.985
So forget I came by.
Don't come back anymore.

14:44.985 --> 14:48.321
Hold on.
I can understand you're mad,
I can accept some of that.

14:48.321 --> 14:50.623
Some of it?

14:50.623 --> 14:52.692
You have a half brother
and sister.

14:52.692 --> 14:54.194
And they're your
family, too.

14:54.194 --> 14:55.695
Now family's important
to you, huh?

14:55.695 --> 14:58.698
Single GSW left chest
during a carjacking.

14:58.698 --> 15:02.202
Jocelyn's at U of I
and Chas is a senior
at South Geary.

15:02.202 --> 15:04.437
BP 100 systolic.
Decreased breath sounds
on the left.

15:04.437 --> 15:06.506
He's probably gonna get
a scholarship from Loyola

15:06.506 --> 15:08.976
if he wins the regional
at tonight's swim meet.

15:08.976 --> 15:10.610
Entry wound left parasternal.
No exit.

15:10.610 --> 15:13.580
All right, intubation
tray, 32 French.
Let's notify the OR.

15:13.580 --> 15:16.149
I'm sorry I walked away.

15:16.149 --> 15:18.986
Don't make the same mistake
I made.

15:20.653 --> 15:23.323
CT's good.
No blood, no mass effect.

15:23.323 --> 15:24.391
Barbecue's ready.

15:24.391 --> 15:27.060
What?
Charcoal's in.

15:27.060 --> 15:28.561
Resps down to 14.

15:28.561 --> 15:30.998
Shallow but clear.
Another .5 of Narcan.

15:30.998 --> 15:33.200
I'm sorry. Can you,
can you, uh, repeat that?

15:33.200 --> 15:35.402
Is that 140 or 114?

15:35.402 --> 15:37.037
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

15:37.037 --> 15:40.007
If you do that, we'll have
to restrain you, okay?

15:40.007 --> 15:42.009
Malik, get him two of Ativan.

15:42.009 --> 15:44.177
Wait a minute.
Are you sure?

15:44.177 --> 15:47.214
I thought benzos could cloud
the neurological picture?

15:47.214 --> 15:49.016
Yeah, fine.

15:49.016 --> 15:50.350
Soft restraints then.

15:50.350 --> 15:51.418
Narcan's in.

15:51.418 --> 15:53.053
Come on, talk to us, doctor.

15:53.053 --> 15:54.421
White count's 12.3,

15:54.421 --> 15:56.123
hemoglobin's 14,
hematocrit is 34...

15:56.123 --> 15:58.491
I gotta GSW.
I need you outta here now.

15:58.491 --> 16:00.327
Kid's ready
to go up to PICU.

16:00.327 --> 16:02.062
He's not.
He's getting worse.

16:02.062 --> 16:03.496
Head CT's fine,
labs are normal,

16:03.496 --> 16:05.398
from the ER standpoint,
workup's done.

16:05.398 --> 16:07.567
He could've
infectious encephalitis.
We should tap him.

16:07.567 --> 16:10.170
They can do it upstairs.
Sounds good. Let's go.

16:10.170 --> 16:13.273
Put him in sutures
until I can get PICU
to pick him.

16:13.273 --> 16:16.243
Need a hand?
Not yet.
I'll let you know.

16:19.112 --> 16:21.248
Did I do something wrong
in there?

16:21.248 --> 16:22.482
No.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.617
Am I not handling
this patient correctly?

16:24.617 --> 16:26.086
Nope.

16:28.121 --> 16:30.290
Are you okay?

16:30.290 --> 16:32.292
Sam's moving out.

16:33.293 --> 16:34.527
Oh.

16:35.562 --> 16:37.230
Why?

16:37.230 --> 16:40.800
I've got a feeling it's
a communication problem.

16:40.800 --> 16:43.170
Well, if you're not sure...

16:43.170 --> 16:44.571
it probably is.

16:44.571 --> 16:46.273
Sorry.

16:46.273 --> 16:48.741
Uh, if you want
to talk about it...
No, no.

16:48.741 --> 16:50.577
If I wanted
to talk about it,

16:50.577 --> 16:52.545
Sam probably wouldn't
be moving out.

16:57.417 --> 16:59.086
Thanks, Luka.

17:01.154 --> 17:03.156
I always thought
it was my fault

17:03.156 --> 17:06.292
that things didn't work out
between us, but...

17:06.292 --> 17:08.361
now I know it was you.
( laughs )

17:08.361 --> 17:10.730
Hey, no problem.

17:14.634 --> 17:16.502
She's gonna need a C-section.

17:16.502 --> 17:19.271
I don't want surgery.
My friend Julia
had a breech.

17:19.271 --> 17:21.508
It was probably a Frank Breech,
which is butt...

17:21.508 --> 17:23.410
COBURN:
You've got
a footling breech.

17:23.410 --> 17:25.845
Cervix doesn't dilate,
the baby's head can get stuck

17:25.845 --> 17:29.549
and the umbilical cord will be
compressed with contraction,
jeopardizing the oxygen supply.

17:29.549 --> 17:31.784
You need to do what's best
for the baby.

17:31.784 --> 17:34.121
What happens if I don't have
the surgery?

17:34.121 --> 17:37.157
Well, we allow the baby
to be delivered up to
the umbilicus

17:37.157 --> 17:38.791
to give the cervix time
to dilate,

17:38.791 --> 17:41.428
and then use maneuvers to
deliver the head and shoulders.

17:41.428 --> 17:42.629
Then let's do that.

17:42.629 --> 17:44.564
Uh, that's not a good idea.

17:44.564 --> 17:48.368
With a footling breech,
there's a 25% chance
of major complications.

17:48.368 --> 17:50.570
It's less than 2%
with a C-section.

17:50.570 --> 17:54.441
But that's a 75% chance
that the baby will be born
without any problems.

17:56.343 --> 17:59.412
Okay, we can wait
while the labor proceeds,

17:59.412 --> 18:01.448
but if the baby's
heart rate gets low,

18:01.448 --> 18:03.450
you may still need
a C-section.

18:03.450 --> 18:06.619
I don't want surgery.

18:06.619 --> 18:08.621
Um, I'll send
somebody down

18:08.621 --> 18:11.258
as soon as we have
a room ready.

18:11.258 --> 18:13.826
Can you please
find Toni for me?

18:13.826 --> 18:16.496
RAY:
You know what?
I'll get her.

18:18.898 --> 18:22.169
Dr. Coburn?
Are you really not going
to consent for surgery?

18:22.169 --> 18:23.836
Can't do it against her will.

18:23.836 --> 18:26.473
What if there's trouble midway,
and needs a rescue section?

18:26.473 --> 18:28.708
I still can't do it.
Are you kidding me?

18:28.708 --> 18:30.343
What about
the intended parents?

18:30.343 --> 18:32.279
This is Toni's baby,
isn't it?

18:32.279 --> 18:34.614
She's the genetic mother
and the intended mother,

18:34.614 --> 18:36.483
but it's still
Claire's body,

18:36.483 --> 18:38.485
and she has the right
to refuse surgery.

18:50.563 --> 18:51.664
MALIK: Abby!
What?

18:51.664 --> 18:52.899
PICU on line three.

18:52.899 --> 18:54.334
Hey, Abby, what's the status

18:54.334 --> 18:56.336
on that kid running
from the mall?

18:56.336 --> 18:58.571
I'm hoping it's PICU
to say they're ready. Why?

18:58.571 --> 19:00.207
His buddies are asking
about him.

19:00.207 --> 19:01.608
Okay, don't let
them leave.

19:01.608 --> 19:04.311
Yeah, this is Abby...
Dr. Lockhart.

19:04.311 --> 19:06.313
Okay, great. We'll send him
right up. Thanks.

19:07.480 --> 19:08.948
Is he okay?

19:08.948 --> 19:12.352
No, he's not okay.

19:12.352 --> 19:15.588
Did he take something?

19:15.588 --> 19:19.226
You guys...
you need to tell me
if he took something, okay?

19:19.226 --> 19:21.728
I've got to go.
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Chuny!

19:21.728 --> 19:24.797
Wait a minute. Not so fast.
Hold on. Hold it. Hold on.

19:24.797 --> 19:26.633
Come here, come here.
Let me go!

19:26.633 --> 19:29.602
No, settle down.
Here, sit down.

19:29.602 --> 19:31.738
Your friend
is very sick.

19:31.738 --> 19:33.440
What's his name?

19:35.475 --> 19:36.709
Liam.

19:37.844 --> 19:40.280
And what did he take?
Nothing.

19:40.280 --> 19:41.948
No drugs?
No.

19:41.948 --> 19:44.617
Then why did you run
when the paramedics showed up?

19:44.617 --> 19:47.354
We were skipping school.

19:47.354 --> 19:48.621
Has Liam been sick?

19:48.621 --> 19:51.358
He hasn't been in school much.
Why not?

19:51.358 --> 19:54.627
His parents are getting divorced
and he has to go back and forth.

19:54.627 --> 19:56.463
That's why we ditched,
to hang out.

19:56.463 --> 19:59.499
Does he have any,
any medical disorders?

19:59.499 --> 20:01.301
Like what?
Anything.

20:01.301 --> 20:04.671
Mm... his family
are vegetarians.

20:07.907 --> 20:09.909
Was he acting
different today?

20:09.909 --> 20:11.778
Not really.

20:11.778 --> 20:13.613
He was kind of bummed, maybe.

20:13.613 --> 20:15.682
He ate two jumbo cheeseburgers.

20:15.682 --> 20:19.652
Didn't you say
he's vegetarian?
Abby, he's getting worse.

20:19.652 --> 20:22.289
What's this?
The kid's backpack.
Find out what's in it.

20:22.289 --> 20:24.457
What's going on?
He seems pretty
unresponsive.

20:24.457 --> 20:26.326
Check his gag reflex.

20:26.326 --> 20:29.329
Liam. Liam.
Whoa, hold it. Liam.

20:29.329 --> 20:31.398
You've got to wake up,
big guy, okay?

20:31.398 --> 20:33.533
He moved his hand
a little bit.

20:33.533 --> 20:35.568
Barely has a gag.
All right, this way.

20:35.568 --> 20:38.371
Okay. You know
the VITAMIN mnemonic?

20:38.371 --> 20:40.407
Vitamins?
Yes, for altered
mental status.

20:40.407 --> 20:42.509
"V" is for vascular,
strokes or clots.

20:42.509 --> 20:43.943
We ruled that out with CT.

20:43.943 --> 20:46.045
"I" is for...

20:46.045 --> 20:47.580
Infection.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.048
What, this game's
only for interns?

20:49.048 --> 20:51.351
Infection--
no pneumonia.

20:51.351 --> 20:53.520
Normal white count,
urine's clean.

20:53.520 --> 20:55.522
We're waiting on the cultures.
"T." "T"?

20:55.522 --> 20:57.757
Trauma.
Or toxins. Utox is negative,

20:57.757 --> 21:00.827
but that doesn't mean
he didn't take something
we can't test for.

21:00.827 --> 21:04.497
What am I looking for?
I don't know.
Drugs, meds. Wait.

21:04.497 --> 21:06.499
What?
It's "M."

21:06.499 --> 21:08.401
Sorry. Sorry.

21:08.401 --> 21:12.405
Um, "M." The "M" in VITAMIN
stands for...

21:12.405 --> 21:14.040
Metabolic.
This kid

21:14.040 --> 21:15.808
could have a metabolic disease

21:15.808 --> 21:17.644
that keeps him
on a restricted diet.

21:17.644 --> 21:19.045
What diet?

21:19.045 --> 21:24.417
His buddy told me
that he was a vegetarian.

21:24.417 --> 21:27.354
What buddy?
And then, today he had
two cheeseburgers.

21:27.354 --> 21:30.490
I'm lost.
We need to get this guy
upstairs, Abby.

21:30.490 --> 21:33.360
No, what we need
is an ammonia level.
Get some ice.

21:33.360 --> 21:35.528
Ammonia has to go
to the lab cold. Run.

21:36.729 --> 21:38.498
That's my Frappuccino!

21:38.498 --> 21:39.999
They can do this upstairs, Abby.

21:39.999 --> 21:42.435
Yeah, after they do
their assessment, review labs,

21:42.435 --> 21:44.437
and repeat X rays.

21:44.437 --> 21:45.938
Meanwhile, his brain
is being pickled

21:45.938 --> 21:48.908
by whatever metabolite
is growing in there.

21:48.908 --> 21:51.578
Okay. Get that to the lab. Go.

21:53.813 --> 21:55.047
Hang in there, Liam.

21:55.047 --> 21:57.417
Good signal.
Fetal heart rate 158.

21:57.417 --> 21:58.685
That's still good, right.

21:58.685 --> 21:59.819
For the time being.

21:59.819 --> 22:01.654
But if your baby
gets in trouble,

22:01.654 --> 22:04.391
and is deprived of oxygen,
every second counts.

22:04.391 --> 22:05.592
But that's not happening.

22:05.592 --> 22:06.859
BARNETT:
Not yet.

22:06.859 --> 22:08.728
You trying
to scare me?

22:08.728 --> 22:11.631
No, I'm just trying to prepare
you for what might happen.

22:11.631 --> 22:14.033
Listen, thousands of
C-sections are performed

22:14.033 --> 22:16.803
in this country every day.
It's a simple procedure.

22:16.803 --> 22:20.072
I want to have more kids of my
own one day-- naturally.

22:20.072 --> 22:23.676
And lots of women go on
to have vaginal births
after having Cesareans.

22:23.676 --> 22:27.046
Excellent variability
of the FHR.

22:27.046 --> 22:29.716
Could I consent,
but only as a last resort?

22:29.716 --> 22:31.551
Only if the baby's
in serious danger?

22:31.551 --> 22:33.720
Absolutely. Sam has
a consent form right here.

22:33.720 --> 22:35.888
Okay, but only
as a last resort.

22:35.888 --> 22:38.725
You need to be made aware
of the risks.

22:38.725 --> 22:40.026
What sort of risks?

22:40.026 --> 22:41.628
Sam.

22:41.628 --> 22:42.995
Bleeding, infection,
paralysis, stroke...

22:42.995 --> 22:43.996
Sam!

22:45.798 --> 22:48.601
These are minimal risks.

22:48.601 --> 22:50.437
Can I speak with you
outside, please?

22:50.437 --> 22:51.638
I don't want this.

22:51.638 --> 22:54.006
No, just, just think
about it, okay?

22:54.006 --> 22:55.942
Okay?

22:55.942 --> 22:59.479
What the hell is
going on in there?

22:59.479 --> 23:02.549
She needs to be aware
of the risks. It's called
informed consent.

23:02.549 --> 23:05.652
You made it sound
like brain transplant.
And you like a pedicure.

23:05.652 --> 23:07.887
It is not your job
to explain the procedures!

23:07.887 --> 23:10.122
No, that's your job,
and you're not doing it.

23:10.122 --> 23:11.558
Look out!
What's going on?

23:11.558 --> 23:13.092
You tell me.

23:13.092 --> 23:15.127
PRATT:
How are we
on the packed cells?

23:15.127 --> 23:16.763
INEZ:
Units 5 and 6 infusing.

23:16.763 --> 23:17.797
BARNETT:
What about Kovac?

23:17.797 --> 23:18.831
I've got this.

23:18.831 --> 23:20.533
What can I do?
Nothing.

23:20.533 --> 23:22.201
Internal paddles again.
Charge to 30.

23:22.201 --> 23:24.036
You're shocking
asystole?
It's fine V-fib.

23:24.036 --> 23:25.905
Clear.

23:25.905 --> 23:27.907
How long
she's been down?
Resuming
compressions.

23:27.907 --> 23:29.942
Greg...
Hang another unit.
Charge the paddles again.

23:29.942 --> 23:32.679
Shouldn't we save blood
for someone who's got a chance?

23:32.679 --> 23:33.813
Proximal great vessel injury,

23:33.813 --> 23:35.482
She's been
down too long.

23:35.482 --> 23:37.584
Now that you two
are residents, you're experts?

23:37.584 --> 23:40.186
If we restore her volume...
It's time to call it.

23:45.224 --> 23:46.859
Call it.
BABINKSI:
Me?

23:46.859 --> 23:49.796
Call it.

23:49.796 --> 23:52.799
Death at 14:40.

23:55.067 --> 23:57.837
What's the survival rate in
patients who reach this hospital

23:57.837 --> 23:59.872
alive after
a penetrating chest trauma?

24:03.209 --> 24:04.844
When you two can answer that,

24:04.844 --> 24:06.713
then you can start
second guessing me.

24:06.713 --> 24:10.182
You want to do something?
Notify her next of kin.

24:12.552 --> 24:14.754
MALIK:
Abby, stats are down to 76.

24:14.754 --> 24:17.089
Can't get a good seal.
He needs a tube. Get a Miller
two and a six-five.

24:17.089 --> 24:18.791
Uh-oh.
What?
What's wrong?

24:18.791 --> 24:20.593
What's going on?

24:20.593 --> 24:23.129
Uh, hypoventilating
at a rate of six.

24:23.129 --> 24:24.564
Is this the mall kid?

24:24.564 --> 24:26.799
Told you to send him
to PICU hours ago.

24:26.799 --> 24:28.568
Suction.
Abby!

24:28.568 --> 24:30.136
I wanted to check
one thing.

24:30.136 --> 24:33.640
Great, so you kept him down here
long enough for him to crash.

24:33.640 --> 24:36.843
Tube. I got some history that
suggested further workup.

24:36.843 --> 24:39.078
Which you should have given
to the team upstairs.

24:39.078 --> 24:40.913
I'm in.

24:46.118 --> 24:47.153
Good chest rise.

24:47.153 --> 24:50.022
ABBY:
Equal breath sounds.

24:50.022 --> 24:52.559
Ammonia's back. 214.
You were right.

24:52.559 --> 24:54.727
The kid has a metabolic
disorder.

24:54.727 --> 24:57.163
Some kind of protein
intolerance. Okay, run to
the pharmacy.

24:57.163 --> 24:58.998
See if the sodium
phenylbutyrate is ready.

24:58.998 --> 25:00.900
Sodium what?

25:00.900 --> 25:03.570
It's a nitrogen scavenger. It'll
help bring down the ammonia

25:03.570 --> 25:04.571
and reverse
the encephalopathy.

25:04.571 --> 25:05.838
Got it.

25:05.838 --> 25:07.907
The kid's family are
strict vegetarians.

25:07.907 --> 25:10.743
But his friends told me today
that he had two cheeseburgers,

25:10.743 --> 25:14.747
because he was depressed.
Because his parents
are getting a divorce.

25:14.747 --> 25:18.284
So it was probably some sort
of fast-food rebellion,

25:18.284 --> 25:20.720
only he can't handle
the protein.

25:20.720 --> 25:22.589
Any family members
to confirm this?

25:22.589 --> 25:24.624
Uh, Chuny's still trying
to track them down.

25:24.624 --> 25:26.859
Switch him to D10 half
at 150 an hour?

25:26.859 --> 25:28.094
You got it.

25:28.094 --> 25:30.329
Luka, I've got a hot MI
on its way.

25:30.329 --> 25:32.198
Be right there.

25:32.198 --> 25:35.001
Lower the ammonia, get him
out of his catabolic tailspin,

25:35.001 --> 25:36.936
he'll start to wake up, right?

25:36.936 --> 25:39.005
...nice pickup.

25:40.239 --> 25:43.109
Lockhart comes up big.

25:48.748 --> 25:51.183
( ball bouncing )

25:52.785 --> 25:54.887
You call that a jump shot?

25:54.887 --> 25:56.889
Hey, Luka.

25:56.889 --> 25:58.725
I hear your mom's
looking at apartments.

25:58.725 --> 26:00.793
Yeah.

26:00.793 --> 26:04.263
Who knows, might be even close
enough for you to walk to my
place.

26:04.263 --> 26:06.933
It's not. It's only
a few blocks from here.

26:06.933 --> 26:09.636
Oh.

26:09.636 --> 26:12.171
You know, it's not my idea.

26:15.642 --> 26:16.709
Back to work.

26:18.878 --> 26:21.714
We're going to still go camping
again on your birthday, right?

26:21.714 --> 26:22.749
Yeah?

26:22.749 --> 26:24.283
Absolutely.

26:30.056 --> 26:31.257
BABINSKI:
Dr. Rasgoata?

26:31.257 --> 26:32.391
Rasgotra.

26:32.391 --> 26:33.960
...Rasgotra.

26:33.960 --> 26:35.862
Neela's fine.
Miss Filmore's freaking out

26:35.862 --> 26:38.731
about how long she's been
waiting to have
her ankle splinted.

26:38.731 --> 26:40.667
Maybe you could help
with this one.

26:43.402 --> 26:45.004
How we doing, Drew?

26:45.004 --> 26:47.006
I've been here
for six hours.

26:47.006 --> 26:49.842
Is there anybody here who knows
what the hell they're doing?

26:49.842 --> 26:51.678
Yeah.
Yes.

26:51.678 --> 26:53.713
Then what the hell
are you waiting for?

26:53.713 --> 26:56.382
I've got a national
sales conference
I'm supposed to be at.

26:56.382 --> 26:59.752
I'm sorry you had to wait.
Sometimes we lose track of time

26:59.752 --> 27:01.387
when we're trying to save
people's lives.

27:01.387 --> 27:04.290
Is that sarcasm?

27:04.290 --> 27:07.026
Because I don't need that.
I'm a customer here.

27:07.026 --> 27:09.061
And if I'm not happy
with the service,

27:09.061 --> 27:13.365
or the way I'm treated,
I will go to your supervisors.

27:13.365 --> 27:14.901
We have a contract.

27:14.901 --> 27:16.903
I didn't agree to surgery.

27:16.903 --> 27:19.806
You agreed to consent
to all medically
necessary procedures,

27:19.806 --> 27:20.840
associated with the pregnancy.

27:20.840 --> 27:22.008
What is going on?

27:22.008 --> 27:23.843
This is my husband, Rob.
Dr. Barnett...

27:23.843 --> 27:25.845
Are you the OB?
No. ER.

27:25.845 --> 27:28.981
She needs a C-section and I have
a legal document
giving permission

27:28.981 --> 27:31.050
BARNETT:
Can we go out to discuss this?

27:31.050 --> 27:34.721
You don't, it's a breach
of contract, and you
won't get paid.

27:34.721 --> 27:36.422
I want to have
the baby naturally.

27:36.422 --> 27:38.457
I'll get a court order
forcing her to.

27:38.457 --> 27:40.292
I don't think
you can.
Watch me.

27:40.292 --> 27:42.194
She's endangering
our unborn child.

27:42.194 --> 27:44.997
I am doing everything
to convince her
to get surgery.

27:44.997 --> 27:48.801
But I can't force her.
She's carrying
our baby.

27:48.801 --> 27:51.037
We've been trying to have
kids for five years.

27:51.037 --> 27:53.272
We spent a fortune
at three tries at IVF

27:53.272 --> 27:54.907
and every time,
I miscarried.

27:54.907 --> 27:57.143
We gave the last
of my embryos to Claire.

27:57.143 --> 27:59.378
I'm sorry, but we
can't do it like this.

27:59.378 --> 28:01.413
Let me go and talk
to her again.

28:01.413 --> 28:03.049
I'm still getting
a court order.

28:03.049 --> 28:04.483
Ray!
She had a late decel.

28:04.483 --> 28:06.152
How low?
108.

28:06.152 --> 28:08.220
Let's get her to the OB.

28:08.220 --> 28:09.856
You need
to wait outside now.

28:09.856 --> 28:11.791
We're taking her
to labor and delivery.

28:11.791 --> 28:12.992
How we doing, Claire?

28:12.992 --> 28:14.026
Are you moving me?

28:14.026 --> 28:15.094
Yep, we're going upstairs.

28:15.094 --> 28:16.328
Inez, go hold
an elevator.

28:16.328 --> 28:19.866
Okay.

28:19.866 --> 28:22.301
BARNETT:
Your baby's heart rate dropped
during the last contraction

28:22.301 --> 28:24.370
which could mean a sign
of cord compression.

28:24.370 --> 28:26.005
The baby could be in trouble.

28:26.005 --> 28:27.239
What's the heart rate now?

28:27.239 --> 28:28.775
112.

28:28.775 --> 28:29.976
That's still okay,
though, right?

28:29.976 --> 28:31.210
Claire?

28:31.210 --> 28:32.244
We're doing okay.

28:32.244 --> 28:33.312
15 liters by mask.

28:33.312 --> 28:35.047
( Claire screaming )

28:35.047 --> 28:37.483
You need to have a C-section,
Claire, you know that.

28:37.483 --> 28:40.787
I know you have to trust me.
I know my own body.

28:40.787 --> 28:42.188
We wanna go with her.
No!

28:42.188 --> 28:44.423
We wanna be there
when our baby is born!

28:44.423 --> 28:46.926
I don't want them
to be there.

28:46.926 --> 28:48.460
( screaming )

28:48.460 --> 28:50.997
MARQUEZ:
Dr. Pratt.
This is Karen Simms.

28:50.997 --> 28:52.899
You treated her mother.

28:52.899 --> 28:53.966
GSW.

28:53.966 --> 28:57.203
Oh, right, thanks, Chuny.

28:57.203 --> 28:59.038
No one will tell me
what happened.

28:59.038 --> 29:01.507
What's GSW? Is that gastric
something? Is she okay?

29:01.507 --> 29:04.476
Uh, would you like
to sit down?

29:04.476 --> 29:05.812
Okay.

29:05.812 --> 29:09.949
GSW stands for
gunshot wound.

29:09.949 --> 29:12.051
Your mother was shot during
a robbery attempt.

29:12.051 --> 29:13.485
She was shot?

29:13.485 --> 29:15.988
Yes.

29:15.988 --> 29:18.825
We gave her blood transfusions,
emergency surgery,

29:18.825 --> 29:21.861
everything we could
to save her.

29:21.861 --> 29:22.829
She's dead?

29:25.832 --> 29:29.268
I'm afraid that her injuries
were too severe.

29:29.268 --> 29:30.402
I'm very sorry.

29:32.471 --> 29:34.540
How did you find me?

29:34.540 --> 29:36.843
We found your name
in her address book.

29:36.843 --> 29:39.578
Did she say anything?

29:39.578 --> 29:42.181
She talked a little
when she was brought in,

29:42.181 --> 29:44.884
but she lost a lot of blood
and lost consciousness

29:44.884 --> 29:48.354
as we were trying
to save her.

29:48.354 --> 29:50.890
Would you like
to see her?

29:50.890 --> 29:51.924
It's too late.

29:54.493 --> 29:57.229
We haven't spoken
in a long time.

29:57.229 --> 29:59.866
We had a falling out
a while back.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.069
We were both waiting
for the other one

30:03.069 --> 30:05.104
to give in and admit
they were wrong.

30:08.207 --> 30:10.009
I guess I win.

30:16.482 --> 30:18.184
I need to push.

30:18.184 --> 30:20.219
No, not yet. Just breathe.
You're doing great.

30:20.219 --> 30:21.453
Fetal heart rate is 120.

30:21.453 --> 30:22.889
Where's pedes?
On their way.

30:22.889 --> 30:24.924
God, it wasn't as
hard the first time.

30:24.924 --> 30:27.459
Take a rest.
Umbilicus past the perineum?

30:27.459 --> 30:31.330
Yup. Good news, Claire.
The baby's hips are out.
You get to push next time.

30:31.330 --> 30:34.500
Okay. I told you I could do
this.

30:34.500 --> 30:37.403
Sterile towel.

30:37.403 --> 30:41.273
Some gentle traction can
help us get to the axilla.

30:41.273 --> 30:43.142
Okay, baby's heart rate's
below 100.

30:43.142 --> 30:45.411
97, 90, 85, 79.

30:45.411 --> 30:48.647
We need to put her on
100% O2, non-rebreather.

30:48.647 --> 30:50.282
What's wrong? Is he okay?

30:50.282 --> 30:52.518
Your baby's heart rate is
dangerously low.

30:52.518 --> 30:54.954
Umbilical cord's getting
compressed, he's not
getting enough oxygen.

30:54.954 --> 30:56.288
68.

30:56.288 --> 30:57.890
It should rebound between
contractions.

30:57.890 --> 30:59.926
We could still
do a Cesarean, Claire.
No.

30:59.926 --> 31:03.395
We can push him back in
and in less than two
minutes-- start surgery.

31:03.395 --> 31:05.064
But he's almost out.

31:05.064 --> 31:07.333
We don't know that.
His head could be entrapped.

31:07.333 --> 31:10.002
Okay, this is it.
Big push, Claire.

31:10.002 --> 31:12.138
The difference between two
minutes and five minutes

31:12.138 --> 31:15.274
of low oxygen is the difference
between a normal and
brain-damaged baby.

31:15.274 --> 31:18.144
Dr. Barnett!
Consent to the C-section.

31:19.979 --> 31:22.214
I'm trying, I'm really trying!

31:22.214 --> 31:24.650
Okay, the head's stuck. We're
going to need to pull him
out with forceps.

31:24.650 --> 31:27.353
Okay, sling a towel
under his body.

31:27.353 --> 31:28.620
Hold him up right here.

31:28.620 --> 31:30.056
WALDRON:
48 on the monitor.

31:30.056 --> 31:31.557
MOOG:
Open the intubation tray.

31:31.557 --> 31:32.992
Okay, Claire, once more.

31:32.992 --> 31:36.062
One big push!

31:40.199 --> 31:42.601
Pretty cyanotic.

31:42.601 --> 31:45.037
Clamp and scissors.

31:45.037 --> 31:46.973
Okay, come on, baby.

31:46.973 --> 31:48.474
Just give us one little cry.

31:48.474 --> 31:51.610
He needs a little stimulation.

31:54.080 --> 31:57.416
No respiratory effort.
Bag him.

31:57.416 --> 31:59.451
No femoral.
Starting compressions.

32:04.090 --> 32:05.491
Three and a half
uncuffed.

32:05.491 --> 32:09.461
Can you please tell Rod
and Toni that he's out?

32:13.199 --> 32:15.001
I'm in.

32:15.001 --> 32:16.735
Epi point zero four by ET.

32:16.735 --> 32:20.006
How is he?

32:20.006 --> 32:21.207
He doesn't have a pulse

32:21.207 --> 32:22.374
and he's not breathing.

32:22.374 --> 32:24.143
So what does that tell you?

32:24.143 --> 32:26.178
Okay, Doctor, that's it--
you're out of here.

32:32.484 --> 32:34.486
I thought I could do it.

32:42.694 --> 32:45.097
( sighing )

33:04.316 --> 33:07.119
( cheering )

33:07.119 --> 33:08.187
Hey, Chas!

33:08.187 --> 33:10.756
Let's do this!

33:15.194 --> 33:16.595
( cheering )

33:16.595 --> 33:18.530
Come on!

33:36.082 --> 33:38.084
Have you been in
to see your baby?

33:38.084 --> 33:39.518
they're still doing
tests on him.

33:39.518 --> 33:42.621
It's been
over an hour.

33:42.621 --> 33:44.523
It was a hard delivery.

33:44.523 --> 33:47.559
What aren't they telling us?

33:54.500 --> 33:56.768
Your son was deprived
of oxygen during the birth.

33:58.804 --> 34:02.608
Um... but... but he's going
to be all right?

34:02.608 --> 34:04.610
We'll know more
in a few days.

34:04.610 --> 34:09.248
There's a good chance
that he suffered
neurologic damage.

34:13.284 --> 34:15.786
Well, did he
or didn't he?

34:19.791 --> 34:21.793
I think that
he probably did.

34:21.793 --> 34:24.763
( sobbing )

34:28.600 --> 34:30.436
Come on, let's go.

34:30.436 --> 34:31.469
Go where?

34:31.469 --> 34:33.405
Home.

34:33.405 --> 34:35.507
What about our son?
I'm not leaving him.

34:35.507 --> 34:38.510
The pediatrician will come
see you and he'll
have more answers.

34:38.510 --> 34:40.846
You already gave us
the answer.

34:40.846 --> 34:44.150
We didn't pay to have
a brain dead baby.

34:44.150 --> 34:46.252
He's not
brain dead.
Rod...

34:46.252 --> 34:47.686
He's not normal.

34:47.686 --> 34:50.522
Which he would have been
if you had done the C-section.

35:06.672 --> 35:10.309
We were going to call him David,
after Rod's father.

35:14.646 --> 35:16.848
Toni, you still can.

35:16.848 --> 35:18.684
ROD:
Let's go.

35:30.829 --> 35:32.764
Hey, Liam,
how are you feeling?

35:32.764 --> 35:34.233
Cruddy.

35:34.233 --> 35:35.867
Well, your parents
are on their way.

35:35.867 --> 35:37.503
They were very worried
about you.

35:37.503 --> 35:39.338
Good.

35:39.338 --> 35:42.608
I'll send them up to the
PICU as soon as they get here.

35:42.608 --> 35:45.677
You'll like it up there.
They have video games.

35:45.677 --> 35:47.813
My friend thinks
you're a MILF.

35:47.813 --> 35:49.481
Shut up.
Ow!

35:49.481 --> 35:50.749
Excuse me?

35:50.749 --> 35:52.384
It's a mother I'd like to...

35:52.384 --> 35:56.422
Ah, well, I'm not a mother.

35:56.422 --> 35:57.656
I'm a doctor.

35:57.656 --> 35:59.458
Guess that makes you
a DILF.

35:59.458 --> 36:02.528
Okay, see you later, Liam.

36:02.528 --> 36:04.930
Stay on your diet, and wear
your Medic Alert bracelet.

36:14.973 --> 36:18.377
Am I supposed to pretend
I didn't see that?

36:18.377 --> 36:19.445
See what?

36:19.445 --> 36:20.946
Okay.

36:20.946 --> 36:23.582
Well, come on.

36:23.582 --> 36:26.652
I don't hear from him
and he sends the ER
a postcard?

36:26.652 --> 36:29.321
You practically chased him out
of town with a torch.

36:29.321 --> 36:31.357
Where's Pratt?
LOCKHART:
He left.

36:31.357 --> 36:34.360
Must be nice
working banker's hours.

36:34.360 --> 36:37.363
Um, no...
this is incomplete.

36:37.363 --> 36:39.565
You didn't document
the distal neurovascular exam.

36:39.565 --> 36:40.866
Let me see...

36:40.866 --> 36:42.868
10 millimeter kidney stone.

36:42.868 --> 36:46.705
No, urology needs to see
this guy prior to discharge.

36:46.705 --> 36:47.939
This...

36:47.939 --> 36:49.741
this looks good.

36:49.741 --> 36:51.977
Just right down the CBC
and Chem 20 results.

36:51.977 --> 36:53.645
Lab slips
are on the back.

36:53.645 --> 36:56.482
Not good enough. You have to
transcribe them to your H&P.

36:56.482 --> 36:57.716
Since when?

36:57.716 --> 36:59.551
There's a new sheriff
in town, ladies.

37:02.854 --> 37:05.291
All right, let's see
if you can do better

37:05.291 --> 37:07.293
than one for four, Lockhart.

37:07.293 --> 37:09.628
Need me to sign off
on some charts?

37:09.628 --> 37:10.729
No.

37:10.729 --> 37:12.564
You said you had stuff for me

37:12.564 --> 37:14.833
to sign off on.
That was Neela.

37:14.833 --> 37:16.502
Aren't those
your charts?

37:16.502 --> 37:19.338
Could someone show me how to do
a filiform and follower?

37:19.338 --> 37:20.672
Where's Ray?

37:20.672 --> 37:23.008
He never came back down
from labor and delivery.

37:23.008 --> 37:25.844
Probably stayed upstairs to hit
on one of those OB nurses.

37:25.844 --> 37:27.646
I'll show you
how to do it.

37:44.930 --> 37:46.398
How's his muscle tone?

37:48.600 --> 37:50.569
Uh, it's not too good.

37:52.504 --> 37:53.839
Is he overbreathing the vent?

37:53.839 --> 37:55.807
No.

37:59.611 --> 38:03.349
Hypoxic brain injury.

38:03.349 --> 38:05.851
The chance for complete
neurological recovery is slim.

38:13.359 --> 38:15.727
Has his mother
been in to see him?

38:19.030 --> 38:21.833
No.

38:21.833 --> 38:23.802
Claire doesn't consider him
her child...

38:26.738 --> 38:29.841
and the Stillmans don't want
a ventilator baby.

38:36.047 --> 38:38.049
There's nothing else
you can do for him.

38:43.855 --> 38:46.492
Little guy has
had a rough day.

38:48.527 --> 38:51.463
I don't think he should spend
his first night all alone.

39:13.952 --> 39:16.822
Hey, Chas.

39:16.822 --> 39:18.457
I'll talk
to you guys later.

39:18.457 --> 39:21.427
All right.

39:21.427 --> 39:23.595
Congratulations, man.
You swam a good race.

39:23.595 --> 39:25.964
Oh, yeah, yeah, thanks.

39:28.033 --> 39:29.501
I'm Greg.

39:29.501 --> 39:31.737
Yeah, I remember you.

39:31.737 --> 39:34.440
Uh, you came to the house
a few weeks ago.

39:34.440 --> 39:36.074
Yeah.

39:36.074 --> 39:39.144
So did your dad say
anything about me?

39:39.144 --> 39:40.178
No.

39:40.178 --> 39:42.013
He didn't?

39:42.013 --> 39:44.049
No, but I mean,
he's right back here

39:44.049 --> 39:46.618
with my mom
and my sister
if you...

39:46.618 --> 39:50.989
No, no, that's cool. I, um, I
actually just wanted
to introduce myself to you.

39:57.629 --> 40:02.434
Your father
and my mother, uh...

40:02.434 --> 40:04.603
I'm your half-brother.

40:04.603 --> 40:06.037
( snorts )

40:06.037 --> 40:07.072
Get outta here.

40:07.072 --> 40:09.741
No, it's true.

40:09.741 --> 40:12.444
I'm just surprised your dad
didn't mention it to you.

40:14.980 --> 40:18.850
I mean, I've heard
family rumors
and stuff, but...

40:22.754 --> 40:25.757
Oh, wow,
this is trippy.

40:33.231 --> 40:35.534
Good to meet you, man.

40:36.568 --> 40:37.836
You, too.

40:37.836 --> 40:39.871
CHARLIE:
Come on, Chas,
I'm starving.

40:43.809 --> 40:46.044
Hey.

40:46.044 --> 40:47.212
Hey...

40:49.214 --> 40:51.617
So you two've met.

40:51.617 --> 40:52.851
Yeah.

40:52.851 --> 40:56.054
Good.

40:56.054 --> 40:58.490
Yeah, that's good.

40:58.490 --> 41:01.960
We're going to get a bite to
eat. Do you want to join us?

41:01.960 --> 41:06.732
Uh, not tonight. I just, uh,
wanted to introduce myself to
Chas, you know.

41:06.732 --> 41:08.867
I'm glad you did, too.

41:08.867 --> 41:10.035
Yeah.

41:12.270 --> 41:14.139
Okay, well,
I've got to go.

41:14.139 --> 41:15.240
Wait, Greg.

41:19.845 --> 41:21.847
Uh, this is my wife,
Evelyn,

41:21.847 --> 41:24.282
and my daughter,
Jocelyn.

41:24.282 --> 41:27.152
This is Greg...

41:30.088 --> 41:31.823
my son.

41:36.928 --> 41:39.030
Nice to meet you,
Greg.

41:39.030 --> 41:40.566
Likewise.

41:40.566 --> 41:42.033
Come join us.

41:42.033 --> 41:43.802
Uh, I can't.

41:43.802 --> 41:46.638
I got to get back
to the hospital.

41:46.638 --> 41:49.074
Maybe another time. It was nice
meeting all of you.

41:49.074 --> 41:51.610
It was nice meeting
you, too, Greg.

41:52.277 --> 41:54.780
Bye.
Come on, Chas.

41:54.780 --> 41:56.081
Hold up, Greg.

42:02.688 --> 42:04.155
You know, this is hard.

42:04.155 --> 42:06.091
For all of us.

42:06.091 --> 42:11.830
So come on, man...
give it a chance.

42:11.830 --> 42:13.599
This is your family.

42:18.003 --> 42:20.138
No, this
is your family.

42:30.916 --> 42:33.051
Sam?

42:39.257 --> 42:41.226
Alex?

43:14.359 --> 43:17.195
