00:46.743 --> 00:49.177
SAGAN:
In the vastness of the cosmos...

00:49.379 --> 00:52.405
...there must be other civilizations
far older...

00:52.615 --> 00:54.480
...and more advanced than ours.

00:54.684 --> 00:58.552
So shouldn't we have been visited?
Shouldn't there be...

00:58.755 --> 01:02.555
...alien ships in the skies of Earth?

01:03.893 --> 01:06.020
There's nothing impossible
in this idea.

01:06.229 --> 01:09.130
And no one would be happier than me
if we were visited.

01:09.332 --> 01:12.358
But has it happened in fact?

01:12.569 --> 01:17.131
What counts is not what's plausible,
not what we'd like to believe...

01:17.340 --> 01:19.706
...not what one or two witnesses
claim.

01:19.909 --> 01:22.776
But only what is supported
by hard evidence...

01:22.979 --> 01:25.709
...rigorously and skeptically
examined.

01:25.915 --> 01:30.852
Extraordinary claims
require extraordinary evidence.

01:34.824 --> 01:39.761
Since 1947, there have been hundreds
of thousands of reports of UFOs:

01:40.130 --> 01:42.997
Unidentified flying objects.

01:43.199 --> 01:44.598
This subject has...

01:44.801 --> 01:48.794
...more to do with religion and
superstition than with science.

01:49.005 --> 01:52.907
Let's consider one of the most famous
accounts of a supposed encounter...

01:53.109 --> 01:55.077
...with alien beings.

01:55.445 --> 01:57.743
On September 19, 1961...

01:57.947 --> 02:01.610
...an American couple was driving home
through New Hampshire.

02:01.985 --> 02:03.452
What's the matter, Delsey?

02:05.288 --> 02:08.086
SAGAN: They were returning along
a lonely road, late at night...

02:08.291 --> 02:10.589
...from a vacation in Canada.

02:12.262 --> 02:15.857
Remember, we have only their word
for what happened next.

02:17.033 --> 02:19.797
(TUNES RADIO)

02:20.804 --> 02:22.772
(STATIC FROM RADIO)

02:23.239 --> 02:25.139
I'm only getting static.

02:27.377 --> 02:29.641
You still don't believe it, do you?

02:30.246 --> 02:33.477
No, I don't. There must be
a reasonable explanation.

02:33.683 --> 02:34.741
Oh!

02:34.951 --> 02:37.442
SAGAN:
They had observed, so they said...

02:37.654 --> 02:40.179
...a strange moving light in the sky.

02:40.390 --> 02:43.689
By definition,
an unidentified flying object.

02:44.060 --> 02:46.324
It seemed to follow them for miles.

02:47.497 --> 02:48.464
Easy there.

02:48.665 --> 02:50.599
What's the matter with that dog?

02:51.601 --> 02:53.626
(HUMMING NOISE)

02:53.837 --> 02:55.395
What's that sound?

02:59.309 --> 03:00.469
I don't know.

03:00.877 --> 03:05.075
After a time, the lighting patterns
on the UFO changed.

03:07.417 --> 03:09.977
It appeared to land.

03:13.590 --> 03:14.557
What the...

03:17.126 --> 03:20.391
It blocked the road,
preventing them from driving on.

03:25.702 --> 03:29.832
They said they saw
mouthless creatures approaching...

03:30.039 --> 03:32.940
...who were not exactly human.

03:33.276 --> 03:34.709
Barney!

03:34.911 --> 03:36.503
Barney, what is that?

03:38.882 --> 03:42.477
At this point, the story
becomes still stranger.

03:42.685 --> 03:46.883
They lost all recollection of what
happened in the next few hours.

03:50.393 --> 03:52.327
But weeks later, they said...

03:52.529 --> 03:56.863
...they recalled some details and
discussed the experience with others.

04:01.170 --> 04:04.469
26 months later, under hypnosis...

04:04.741 --> 04:07.209
...they reported that
a UFO had landed...

04:07.410 --> 04:09.878
...and that the crew had emerged.

04:20.156 --> 04:25.093
They were captured, they said,
and taken aboard the craft.

04:34.470 --> 04:35.630
(WHINES)

04:42.145 --> 04:46.013
That was the story told by
Betty and Barney Hill.

04:46.215 --> 04:49.912
Virtually all scientists
who've studied it are skeptical.

04:50.119 --> 04:54.647
But UFO enthusiasts think
the Hill case is a classic example...

04:54.857 --> 04:58.190
...of a " close encounter
of the third kind."

04:58.394 --> 05:01.625
Why? What makes it so special?

05:03.299 --> 05:05.460
While on board, Betty had noticed...

05:05.668 --> 05:08.933
...a book written in an unknown
hieroglyphic writing.

05:09.138 --> 05:12.596
She was also shown a strange window
through which she could see...

05:12.809 --> 05:16.006
...a glowing pattern of dots
connected with lines.

05:16.212 --> 05:18.703
It was, they told her, a star map...

05:18.915 --> 05:22.180
...displaying the routes
of interstellar commerce.

05:22.385 --> 05:25.684
Afterwards, they were released
and permitted to return home.

05:25.888 --> 05:27.981
Or at least, this is their story.

05:28.625 --> 05:31.890
Believers find this compelling,
or at least plausible...

05:32.095 --> 05:34.689
...chiefly because of
the alleged star map.

05:35.264 --> 05:38.233
Here's how Betty said it looked.

05:38.434 --> 05:41.062
Why would we take this seriously?

05:41.270 --> 05:46.071
Because here is a real map widely
publicized by UFO enthusiasts...

05:46.275 --> 05:50.541
...of 15 selected nearby stars,
including the sun...

05:50.813 --> 05:54.408
...as seen from one particular
vantage point in space.

05:54.617 --> 05:56.244
This map includes stars...

05:56.919 --> 05:59.649
...that were first cataloged
several years after...

05:59.856 --> 06:03.485
...Betty Hill recalled what she says
she saw in the alien ship.

06:03.693 --> 06:05.888
Her map required, we are told...

06:06.095 --> 06:08.529
...information that wasn't
available on Earth.

06:09.499 --> 06:12.935
There is a resemblance between
the two maps, but that's because...

06:13.136 --> 06:15.900
...the lines corresponding
to navigation routes...

06:16.105 --> 06:20.201
...have been copied from the Hill map
onto the real star map.

06:20.543 --> 06:24.843
If we were to substitute
some other set of lines...

06:25.048 --> 06:28.711
...for the Hill lines, we find that
the eye suddenly is biased...

06:28.918 --> 06:32.410
...against seeing any agreement
between the two maps at all.

06:33.589 --> 06:38.458
To make an objective test, however,
let's remove the lines altogether.

06:40.830 --> 06:43.799
And then there's very little
resemblance left.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.627
But these particular stars...

06:45.835 --> 06:49.134
...are selected from a large catalog
of star positions.

06:49.338 --> 06:52.307
Our vantage point is also
selected to make the best...

06:52.508 --> 06:54.976
...possible fit with the Hill map.

06:55.178 --> 06:58.773
If you can pick and choose
from a large number of stars...

06:58.981 --> 07:01.279
...viewed from any vantage point
in space...

07:01.484 --> 07:05.545
...you can always find a resemblance
to the pattern you're looking for.

07:05.755 --> 07:07.848
I'm surprised that nobody found...

07:08.057 --> 07:11.083
...a better fit to the Hill map.

07:12.562 --> 07:17.329
The Hills' own psychiatrist described
their story as a kind of dream.

07:17.533 --> 07:21.594
There's no corroborating evidence.
The star map argument is worthless.

07:21.804 --> 07:24.773
And yet this is one of
the best attested cases...

07:24.974 --> 07:27.306
...of UFO close encounters.

07:27.510 --> 07:29.307
For all I know, we're visited...

07:29.512 --> 07:33.448
...by a different extraterrestrial
civilization every second Tuesday.

07:33.649 --> 07:36.880
But there's no support
for this appealing idea.

07:37.086 --> 07:41.318
The extraordinary claims are not
supported by extraordinary evidence.

07:42.859 --> 07:46.192
There are curious daylight photos
of UFOs.

07:48.765 --> 07:50.756
Some look suspiciously like...

07:50.967 --> 07:54.095
...hats or hubcaps thrown
into the air.

07:54.303 --> 07:56.430
Photos can be faked.

08:01.477 --> 08:04.275
More common are unidentified
lights at night.

08:04.480 --> 08:05.640
They're often aircraft.

08:05.848 --> 08:09.511
But if we can't identify a light,
that doesn't make it a spaceship.

08:14.791 --> 08:17.351
Here's a movie of what
you might think is a UFO.

08:17.560 --> 08:20.495
Actually it's a piece
of an asteroid burning up...

08:20.696 --> 08:23.028
...as it enters the Earth's
atmosphere.

08:29.705 --> 08:34.039
Most reports of UFOs turn out
to be something else, like...

08:34.243 --> 08:38.976
...the refracted image of a planet or
re-entry of an artificial satellite.

08:39.182 --> 08:42.811
Some are psychological aberrations.
Some are hoaxes.

08:43.052 --> 08:46.886
Never is there any compelling
physical evidence...

08:47.089 --> 08:50.456
...a detailed close-up photograph
of a strange spacecraft...

08:50.660 --> 08:53.823
...or a small device of
extraterrestrial manufacture...

08:54.030 --> 08:56.965
...or a book written in
alien hieroglyphics.

08:57.166 --> 08:58.224
Never.

08:58.434 --> 09:03.030
There are reports of such things,
but never the things themselves.

09:05.608 --> 09:10.238
The search for alien civilizations
retains its importance despite...

09:10.446 --> 09:13.472
...the striking failure
of the UFO evidence.

09:13.683 --> 09:16.675
Most astronomers consider
extraterrestrial life...

09:16.886 --> 09:20.947
...a subject worthy of vigorous,
if cautious, pursuit.

09:21.157 --> 09:25.287
For myself, I find something
irresistible in the idea of...

09:25.494 --> 09:28.861
...discovering a token,
maybe a simple inscription...

09:29.065 --> 09:34.002
...which would provide the key to
understanding an alien civilization.

09:34.370 --> 09:38.238
This is an appeal we humans
have felt before.

09:54.590 --> 09:55.818
In 1801...

09:56.025 --> 10:00.962
...a famous physicist was governor
of the French province of IsÃ¨re.

10:03.132 --> 10:05.862
His name was Joseph Fourier.

10:07.270 --> 10:09.898
On an inspection of the schools
in his province...

10:10.106 --> 10:13.041
...Fourier discovered an exceptional
11-year-old boy:

10:13.242 --> 10:15.301
Jean Francois Champollion.

10:19.849 --> 10:24.047
The boy's precocious intellect and
remarkable flair for languages...

10:24.253 --> 10:27.313
...had earned him the admiration
of local scholars.

10:27.523 --> 10:30.185
Fourier too was impressed.

10:34.897 --> 10:38.060
What Champollion first saw
in Fourier's house...

10:38.267 --> 10:40.167
...determined the course
of his life...

10:40.369 --> 10:44.066
...and unlocked the secrets
of an alien civilization.

10:46.509 --> 10:50.172
Fourier had recently participated,
as one of many scientists...

10:50.379 --> 10:53.041
...in Napoleon's expedition
to the Middle East.

10:53.249 --> 10:57.948
He had been in charge of cataloging
the astronomical monuments of Egypt.

11:00.089 --> 11:03.183
The boy was entranced by
Fourier's collection...

11:03.392 --> 11:05.656
...of ancient Egyptian artifacts:

11:05.861 --> 11:08.796
The mysterious fragments
of a lost world.

11:17.573 --> 11:20.599
France at this time was flooded
with such artifacts...

11:20.810 --> 11:22.539
...plundered by Napoleon...

11:22.745 --> 11:27.341
...and now arousing intense interest
among scholars and the general public.

11:39.095 --> 11:40.687
His attention was caught...

11:40.896 --> 11:44.332
...by a specimen of
Egyptian hieroglyphics.

11:56.679 --> 11:58.738
"What do they mean?" he asked.

11:59.415 --> 12:02.043
"Nobody knows," was Fourier's reply.

12:03.119 --> 12:05.519
Then and there,
Champollion resolved...

12:05.721 --> 12:08.849
...he would understand this language
no one could read...

12:09.058 --> 12:12.994
...he would decode the messages
from another world and another time.

12:13.195 --> 12:18.064
He became a superb linguist and
immersed himself in the hieroglyphics.

12:24.173 --> 12:28.735
Fourier edited the illustrated
description of Napoleon's expedition.

12:28.944 --> 12:32.243
The young Champollion
studied it hungrily.

12:33.816 --> 12:35.181
To the people of Europe...

12:35.384 --> 12:40.321
...these exotic images revealed
an utterly alien civilization...

12:40.656 --> 12:45.593
...a world of towering monuments
and magical names.

12:45.961 --> 12:47.622
Dendera.

12:47.830 --> 12:49.388
Karnak.

12:49.799 --> 12:51.232
Luxor.

12:53.936 --> 12:58.873
Every illustration was a riddle
posed by the past to the present.

13:04.847 --> 13:09.284
And among them were pictures of
something called the Rosetta Stone...

13:11.754 --> 13:16.657
...and portraits of the people who
lived among the ruins of the pharaohs.

13:20.296 --> 13:23.788
Egypt became the land of
Champollion's dreams.

13:25.801 --> 13:27.860
But it was not until 1828...

13:28.070 --> 13:31.335
...27 years after his fateful
visit with Fourier...

13:31.540 --> 13:34.976
...that Champollion
first set foot in Egypt.

13:40.983 --> 13:45.716
With his companions, Champollion
chartered boats in Cairo...

13:45.921 --> 13:48.856
...and sailed slowly upstream...

13:49.058 --> 13:52.516
...following the course of the Nile.

14:05.641 --> 14:08.132
It was a journey of many weeks...

14:08.344 --> 14:12.337
...which Champollion recorded
in extraordinary detail.

14:22.591 --> 14:25.583
This was an expedition through time...

14:25.794 --> 14:28.354
...a voyage across the centuries...

14:28.564 --> 14:30.156
...to another world.

14:38.307 --> 14:40.207
Champollion, as an adult...

14:40.409 --> 14:44.277
...had worked out a brilliant
decipherment of the hieroglyphics.

14:44.480 --> 14:48.416
A word, incidentally,
that means "sacred carvings."

14:50.886 --> 14:53.320
Now Champollion was making
a pilgrimage...

14:53.522 --> 14:58.289
...to the scene of ancient mysteries
he had been the first to understand.

15:26.922 --> 15:28.412
Champollion wrote:

15:28.624 --> 15:33.459
"The evening of the 16th,
we finally arrived at Dendera.

15:40.369 --> 15:43.702
We were only an hour away
from the temples.

15:46.875 --> 15:49.139
Could we resist the temptation?

15:49.345 --> 15:52.678
I ask the coldest of you mortals!

15:56.252 --> 16:00.086
To dine and leave immediately
were the orders of the moment.

16:06.829 --> 16:11.425
Alone and without guides,
we crossed the fields.

16:15.037 --> 16:18.734
Presuming that the temples were
in a straight line from our boat...

16:18.941 --> 16:22.707
...we walked thus for an hour and
a half without finding anything.

16:22.911 --> 16:25.937
We discovered a man who put us
on the correct route...

16:26.148 --> 16:29.481
...and ended up walking with us
with good graces.

16:35.958 --> 16:39.553
The temple appeared to us at last.

16:50.039 --> 16:53.736
I shall not try to describe
the impression which the porches...

16:53.942 --> 16:56.775
...and above all,
the portico made on us.

16:59.348 --> 17:01.908
We stayed there two hours
in ecstasy...

17:02.117 --> 17:05.280
...running through the huge rooms
and trying to read...

17:05.487 --> 17:08.547
...the exterior inscriptions
in the moonlight."

17:15.164 --> 17:17.928
It was with no small rapture
that Champollion...

17:18.133 --> 17:22.627
...entered the secret places of
the temple and scanned the words...

17:22.838 --> 17:26.137
...that had waited patiently
through half a million nights...

17:26.342 --> 17:27.866
...for a reader.

17:31.347 --> 17:34.145
To his brother, Champollion
wrote of his joy...

17:34.350 --> 17:38.343
...in confirming that he could
understand the writing on these walls.

17:40.055 --> 17:41.920
"I am now proud," he said...

17:42.124 --> 17:45.389
"...that having followed
the course of the Nile...

17:45.594 --> 17:49.928
...I have the right to announce there
is nothing to modify in our letter...

17:50.132 --> 17:52.498
...on the alphabet of hieroglyphics.

18:01.176 --> 18:03.007
Our alphabet is good.

18:03.212 --> 18:06.613
It is applicable with the same
success, first of all...

18:06.815 --> 18:09.147
...in Egyptian monuments of
the Roman epoch...

18:09.351 --> 18:11.251
...and, which is more interesting...

18:11.453 --> 18:15.480
...to the inscriptions on all
temples, palaces and tombs...

18:15.691 --> 18:17.886
...of the Pharaonic epoch."

18:23.098 --> 18:28.035
Champollion was overwhelmed by
the grandeur which surrounded him.

18:28.837 --> 18:30.395
"It is the union," he said...

18:30.606 --> 18:34.872
"...of grace and majesty
in the highest degree.

18:35.077 --> 18:37.170
We in Europe are only dwarfs.

18:37.379 --> 18:41.406
No nation, ancient or modern, has
conceived the art of architecture...

18:41.617 --> 18:45.451
...on such a sublime, great
and imposing style...

18:45.654 --> 18:47.349
...as the ancient Egyptians.

18:47.556 --> 18:52.186
They ordered everything to be done
for people who are 100 feet high."

18:59.501 --> 19:03.369
This is the great temple of Karnak...

19:03.572 --> 19:04.971
...in upper Egypt...

19:05.174 --> 19:09.736
...continuously constructed over
a period of more than 2,000 years...

19:09.945 --> 19:12.072
...until the time of Ptolemy.

19:12.281 --> 19:14.749
It was here Champollion wrote:

19:14.950 --> 19:19.853
"That all the Pharaonic magnificence
appeared to me."

19:20.055 --> 19:22.216
What he had seen elsewhere, he said...

19:22.424 --> 19:24.221
..."Seemed to me, miserable...

19:24.426 --> 19:28.829
...compared with the colossal
conceptions around me."

19:51.820 --> 19:54.687
On these walls and columns
at Karnak...

19:54.890 --> 19:57.188
...at Dendera and everywhere else
in Egypt...

19:57.392 --> 20:00.759
...Champollion found that
he could read inscriptions...

20:00.963 --> 20:04.490
...that his decipherment of a few
years earlier had been correct.

20:04.700 --> 20:07.032
But how had he figured it out?

20:10.038 --> 20:13.872
Many had tried and failed
to read the hieroglyphics.

20:14.076 --> 20:18.911
A group of scholars thought they were
a picture code full of metaphors...

20:19.114 --> 20:23.915
...mostly about eyeballs,
wavy lines and animals.

20:24.119 --> 20:28.920
Birds, especially birds,
lots of birds.

20:31.760 --> 20:36.697
Some deduced that the Egyptians
had been colonists from China.

20:37.099 --> 20:40.159
There were those who deduced it
the other way around.

20:44.506 --> 20:49.068
There's one who, from one look at the
Rosetta Stone, deduced its meaning.

20:49.278 --> 20:51.940
He said that the quickness
of his decipherment...

20:52.147 --> 20:55.639
...enabled him "to avoid
the systematic errors...

20:55.851 --> 20:59.514
...which invariably arise
from prolonged reflection."

20:59.721 --> 21:03.817
You get better results, he's saying,
if you don't think about it too much.

21:04.026 --> 21:08.224
As in the search for
extraterrestrial intelligence today...

21:08.430 --> 21:11.558
...the unbridled speculation
by amateurs...

21:11.767 --> 21:15.294
...served to frighten many
professionals right out of the field.

21:25.881 --> 21:27.678
Champollion was not frightened.

21:27.883 --> 21:30.511
He was also not distracted
by the idea...

21:30.719 --> 21:33.449
...of hieroglyphs as
pictorial metaphors.

21:33.655 --> 21:35.213
Instead...

21:35.424 --> 21:40.088
...using the insights of a brilliant
English physicist, Thomas Young...

21:40.295 --> 21:42.388
...he proceeded something like this:

21:42.998 --> 21:47.332
This is an exact replica
of the Rosetta Stone.

21:47.536 --> 21:50.471
The original had been found
in the year 1799...

21:50.672 --> 21:53.436
...by a French soldier working
on the fortifications...

21:53.642 --> 21:56.577
...of the Nile delta town of Rashid...

21:56.778 --> 22:00.942
...which the Europeans, in their
persistence not to learn Arabic...

22:01.149 --> 22:02.582
...called "Rosetta."

22:02.784 --> 22:07.551
It had been part of an ancient temple
which had been torn down.

22:07.823 --> 22:10.986
If we look at it,
we see that it clearly...

22:11.193 --> 22:14.993
...represents the same text
in three different languages.

22:15.564 --> 22:18.533
Up at the top,
ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics.

22:18.734 --> 22:21.294
In the middle, a kind of cursive...

22:21.503 --> 22:23.994
...and later hieroglyphic
called "Demotic."

22:24.206 --> 22:28.370
And down at the bottom,
the key to the enterprise: Greek.

22:28.744 --> 22:32.680
Champollion could read ancient Greek,
he was a superb linguist...

22:32.881 --> 22:36.908
...and discovered that this stone
had been inscribed...

22:37.119 --> 22:38.950
...to commemorate the coronation...

22:39.154 --> 22:42.351
...of King Ptolemy V
Epiphanes...

22:42.557 --> 22:47.051
...in the spring of the year 196 B.C.

22:47.529 --> 22:52.432
As expected, the Greek text includes
many references to King Ptolemy.

22:52.634 --> 22:54.192
Here you can see it.

22:54.403 --> 22:58.737
"Ptolemaeus."

22:59.941 --> 23:03.934
In roughly the same positions
but in the hieroglyphic text...

23:04.513 --> 23:09.382
...are these ovals or "cartouches"
as they are called.

23:09.584 --> 23:13.111
And if this cartouche really
means "Ptolemy"...

23:13.321 --> 23:18.258
...the individual hieroglyphs are not
likely to be pictograms or metaphors.

23:18.460 --> 23:22.419
Much more likely, they're letters
or at least syllables.

23:22.631 --> 23:25.065
Champollion had the presence
of mind...

23:25.267 --> 23:28.498
...to count up the number
of Greek words...

23:28.704 --> 23:31.867
...and the number of
individual hieroglyphics...

23:32.074 --> 23:34.338
...in what are presumably
equivalent texts.

23:34.543 --> 23:38.809
He found that the number of
individual hieroglyphs...

23:39.014 --> 23:42.211
...is much larger than the number
of Greek words...

23:42.417 --> 23:46.353
...again implying that the hieroglyphs
are mainly letters and syllables.

23:46.555 --> 23:51.185
But which hieroglyphs correspond
to which letters?

23:51.393 --> 23:55.625
Fortunately, Champollion had available
a kind of second Rosetta Stone...

23:55.831 --> 23:59.790
...an obelisk which had been excavated
at the temple of Philae...

24:00.001 --> 24:03.630
...and which had inscribed upon it...

24:03.839 --> 24:08.208
...cartouches representing
the hieroglyphic equivalent...

24:08.410 --> 24:12.312
...of another Greek name: Cleopatra.

24:13.081 --> 24:17.313
So here we have
the Cleopatra cartouche.

24:17.519 --> 24:20.886
And here, the Ptolemaeus cartouche.

24:21.089 --> 24:24.616
Here, we've turned it around,
changing left to right...

24:24.826 --> 24:28.762
...to right to left, and spread the
hieroglyphs out so we see them all.

24:29.131 --> 24:33.465
Now, immediately we notice that
there are some similarities.

24:33.668 --> 24:37.035
This first hieroglyph in Ptolemy
is a kind of square.

24:37.239 --> 24:40.766
The fifth hieroglyph in Cleopatra
is a square.

24:41.276 --> 24:44.404
But "Cleopatra"...

24:44.613 --> 24:47.047
Both of them seem to represent a "p."

24:47.249 --> 24:50.878
So Ptolemy and Cleopatra...

24:51.086 --> 24:53.486
...both give us
the same interpretation:

24:53.688 --> 24:56.316
A square is a "p."

24:56.625 --> 24:59.560
Likewise, the fourth hieroglyph...

24:59.761 --> 25:02.286
...in Ptolemy is a lion.

25:02.497 --> 25:04.863
"P-t-o-I."

25:05.066 --> 25:09.730
Likewise, the second hieroglyph
in Cleopatra is an "I."

25:10.539 --> 25:14.566
So again it's consistent.
The pattern is emerging.

25:14.776 --> 25:18.473
Likewise, this rope or
hangman's noose...

25:18.680 --> 25:21.444
..."Ptolemy." It's an "o."

25:21.650 --> 25:24.312
"Cleopatra." It's an "o."

25:24.519 --> 25:28.717
And in this way, Champollion
was able to assign...

25:29.724 --> 25:34.661
...letters for each of
the hieroglyphs we see here.

25:36.298 --> 25:38.266
"Ptolemaeus."

25:38.600 --> 25:40.795
And, likewise...

25:41.002 --> 25:44.733
..."Cleopatra."

25:44.940 --> 25:48.068
The eagle is an "a."

25:48.777 --> 25:51.405
Notice there are two different
symbols for "t."

25:51.613 --> 25:54.343
But in English, the same sort
of thing, "f" and "ph."

25:55.250 --> 25:57.775
Champollion discovered that
the hieroglyphics...

25:57.986 --> 26:00.079
...were a simple substitution cipher.

26:00.288 --> 26:02.848
Now, there's other stuff in here.

26:03.058 --> 26:05.618
All the rest of this:
What's that about?

26:05.827 --> 26:07.852
Well, he was later able to find out...

26:08.063 --> 26:10.793
...this is a symbol called
the "ankh" which means "life."

26:10.999 --> 26:14.594
There's a "pt." That's an "ah."
It makes "Ptah"...

26:14.803 --> 26:16.100
...name of a god.

26:16.304 --> 26:18.329
And the whole cartouche read:

26:18.540 --> 26:21.441
"Ptolemy, ever living...

26:21.643 --> 26:24.203
...beloved of the god, Ptah."

26:24.412 --> 26:27.210
And the end of the "Cleopatra"
is a short form...

26:27.415 --> 26:29.883
...meaning "Daughter of Isis."

26:31.086 --> 26:34.522
So it turns out that Champollion's
opponents were not wholly wrong.

26:34.723 --> 26:38.591
Some of the hieroglyphs, for example,
the symbol "ankh"...

26:38.793 --> 26:42.627
...which means life, are ideograms
or pictograms.

26:42.831 --> 26:45.265
But the key to the enterprise...

26:45.467 --> 26:48.630
...Champollion's success, rested
on his realization...

26:48.837 --> 26:53.467
...that the hieroglyphs were
essentially letters and syllables.

26:53.675 --> 26:56.200
In retrospect, it sounds almost easy.

26:56.411 --> 27:00.973
But it took people hundreds of years
before they figured it out.

27:02.384 --> 27:07.287
Champollion walked these halls and
casually read the inscriptions...

27:07.489 --> 27:09.457
...which had mystified everybody else.

27:09.658 --> 27:13.754
Answering the question he had
posed as a child to Fourier:

27:13.962 --> 27:15.930
"What do they mean?"

27:16.564 --> 27:19.055
What a joy it must have
been for him...

27:19.267 --> 27:24.204
...to open this one-way communications
channel with another civilization...

27:24.472 --> 27:29.273
...to permit a culture which
had been mute for millennia...

27:29.477 --> 27:33.743
...to speak of its history,
magic, medicine...

27:33.949 --> 27:37.510
...religion, politics, philosophy.

27:51.166 --> 27:53.634
Today, we also are seeking messages...

27:53.835 --> 27:56.599
...from an ancient and
exotic civilization.

27:56.805 --> 27:58.864
A civilization hidden from us...

28:00.175 --> 28:03.576
...not in time, but in space.

28:04.846 --> 28:09.306
Today, we are searching for
a message from the stars.

28:09.517 --> 28:13.817
We have not found it so far.
We have, as yet, no Champollion.

28:14.022 --> 28:15.421
But we are just beginning.

28:15.623 --> 28:20.526
Perhaps those who will decipher the
first interstellar communications...

28:20.729 --> 28:25.632
...are alive at this moment,
somewhere on the planet Earth.

28:29.704 --> 28:33.037
Extraterrestrial beings will
have a different biology...

28:33.241 --> 28:36.108
...a different culture,
a different language.

28:36.311 --> 28:39.178
How could we possibly understand
their messages?

28:39.381 --> 28:43.249
Is there in any sense
a cosmic Rosetta Stone?

28:45.520 --> 28:46.782
I believe there is.

28:46.988 --> 28:51.482
All the technical civilizations in
the cosmos, no matter how different...

28:51.693 --> 28:53.957
...must have one language in common:

28:54.162 --> 28:57.222
The language called "science."

28:59.334 --> 29:03.270
The laws of nature are
everywhere the same.

29:06.207 --> 29:11.008
Every chemical element has
a specific signature in the spectrum.

29:11.212 --> 29:15.205
So there are identical patterns in the
light of a candle flame on Earth...

29:15.417 --> 29:18.318
...and in the light of
a distant galaxy.

29:20.688 --> 29:23.020
The spectra show not only...

29:23.224 --> 29:26.284
...that the same chemical elements
exist throughout space...

29:26.494 --> 29:30.624
...but also that the same
laws of quantum mechanics...

29:30.832 --> 29:32.493
...govern atoms everywhere.

29:32.700 --> 29:34.691
Beings growing up on any world...

29:34.903 --> 29:38.464
...must come to grips with
the identical laws of nature.

29:41.242 --> 29:46.179
Galaxies billions of light-years
distant evolve a spiral form.

29:46.448 --> 29:48.143
So does our own Milky Way.

29:48.349 --> 29:52.012
The same gravitational forces
are at work.

29:52.854 --> 29:54.219
And on planets also:

29:54.422 --> 29:58.552
There are spiral storm
systems on Jupiter.

30:00.462 --> 30:03.659
The same patterns are common on Earth.

30:05.633 --> 30:09.228
The intelligent beings on every
world will, sooner or later...

30:09.437 --> 30:11.803
...understand the laws of nature.

30:12.006 --> 30:14.372
Someday, perhaps soon...

30:14.576 --> 30:18.774
...a message from the depths of space
may arrive on our small world.

30:18.980 --> 30:20.914
If we wish to understand it...

30:21.116 --> 30:24.779
...we first have to understand
science.

30:31.993 --> 30:35.622
We do not expect an advanced
technical civilization...

30:35.830 --> 30:38.594
...on any other planet
of our solar system.

30:41.436 --> 30:45.896
If they were only a little behind us,
10,000 years, say...

30:46.107 --> 30:49.133
...they would have no advanced
technology at all.

30:51.846 --> 30:53.643
If they're a little ahead of us...

30:53.848 --> 30:57.409
...we who are already exploring
the solar system...

30:57.619 --> 30:59.610
...then they should be here by now.

31:00.588 --> 31:02.749
To communicate with other
civilizations...

31:02.957 --> 31:05.983
...our technology must reach across
not merely...

31:06.194 --> 31:08.628
...interplanetary distances...

31:08.830 --> 31:11.628
...but interstellar distances.

31:15.904 --> 31:18.202
Ideally, the method
should be inexpensive.

31:18.406 --> 31:23.343
A huge amount of information could
be sent and received at little cost.

31:25.747 --> 31:26.714
It should be fast...

31:26.915 --> 31:30.783
...so an interstellar dialogue
is eventually possible.

31:31.753 --> 31:32.913
It ought to be obvious...

31:33.121 --> 31:37.023
...so that any technical civilization,
no matter its evolutionary path...

31:37.225 --> 31:39.386
...will discover it early.

31:41.462 --> 31:44.226
Surprisingly, there is such a method.

31:44.432 --> 31:47.367
It's called radio astronomy.

31:50.271 --> 31:54.071
This is the largest
radio/radar telescope...

31:54.275 --> 31:58.336
...on the planet Earth,
the Arecibo Observatory.

32:01.149 --> 32:05.313
It's located in a remote valley
on the island of Puerto Rico.

32:08.223 --> 32:12.023
It sends and receives radio signals.

32:12.327 --> 32:14.522
But it's so large and powerful...

32:14.729 --> 32:17.562
...it can communicate with
an identical radio telescope...

32:17.765 --> 32:20.859
...15,000 light-years away...

32:21.069 --> 32:25.062
...halfway to the center
of the Milky Way galaxy.

32:28.076 --> 32:32.513
The Arecibo Observatory has been
used, although sparingly...

32:32.714 --> 32:35.945
...to search for signals
from civilizations in space...

32:36.150 --> 32:38.141
...and, just once...

32:38.353 --> 32:42.289
...to broadcast a message
to a distant star cluster...

32:42.490 --> 32:45.357
...called "M13."

32:49.831 --> 32:52.493
But is there anyone out there
to talk to?

32:56.037 --> 33:00.098
With 400 billion stars in
the Milky Way galaxy alone...

33:00.308 --> 33:03.869
...could ours be the only one
with an inhabited planet?

33:06.614 --> 33:08.138
How much more likely it is...

33:08.349 --> 33:13.218
...that the galaxy is throbbing and
humming with advanced societies.

33:13.421 --> 33:16.948
Perhaps near one of those
pinpoints of light in our night sky...

33:17.158 --> 33:19.490
...someone quite different from us...

33:19.694 --> 33:23.027
...is glancing idly at
the star we call the sun...

33:23.231 --> 33:25.893
...and entertaining,
just for a moment...

33:26.100 --> 33:29.035
...an outrageous speculation.

33:39.380 --> 33:42.941
There are an enormous number
of stars.

33:44.552 --> 33:47.988
Only some of them will have
planets suitable for life.

33:49.724 --> 33:53.558
On only some of those worlds
will intelligence arise.

33:54.762 --> 33:57.959
And perhaps a few of those
civilizations will avoid...

33:58.166 --> 34:02.899
...the trap jointly set by their
technology and their passions.

34:05.773 --> 34:10.301
If there are many civilizations,
one of them should be rather close by.

34:11.512 --> 34:13.673
If there are few civilizations...

34:13.881 --> 34:17.578
...then even the nearest
may be very far away.

34:26.794 --> 34:31.493
This is one of the great questions:
How many advanced civilizations...

34:31.699 --> 34:35.692
...capable at least of radio astronomy
are there in the Milky Way galaxy?

34:35.937 --> 34:40.874
Let's call the number of such
civilizations by capital letter "N."

34:41.275 --> 34:43.800
It's a number.
It depends on many things.

34:44.011 --> 34:46.571
It depends on the number
of stars in the Milky Way.

34:46.781 --> 34:49.511
Let's call that N sub-star.

34:49.717 --> 34:52.015
The fraction of stars
that have planets...

34:52.220 --> 34:54.620
...is called f sub-p.

34:55.123 --> 34:58.354
The average number of planets
in a given solar system...

34:58.559 --> 35:00.823
...ecologically suitable for life...

35:01.396 --> 35:03.990
...is called n sub-e.

35:04.198 --> 35:08.191
The fraction of suitable planets
in which life actually arises...

35:08.403 --> 35:10.234
...is called f sub-I.

35:10.438 --> 35:12.702
The fraction of inhabited planets...

35:12.907 --> 35:15.000
...on which intelligence emerges...

35:15.209 --> 35:17.177
...is called f sub-i.

35:18.146 --> 35:22.674
On the fraction of those planets in
which the intelligent beings evolve...

35:22.884 --> 35:25.978
...a technical, communicative
civilization...

35:26.187 --> 35:27.586
...call that f sub-c.

35:28.022 --> 35:32.391
Finally, it depends on the fraction
of a planet's lifetime...

35:32.593 --> 35:36.188
...that's graced by
a technical civilization.

35:36.397 --> 35:37.955
Call that f sub-L.

35:40.568 --> 35:43.628
If we multiply all these
numbers together...

35:43.838 --> 35:47.365
...we've estimated N,
the number of civilizations.

35:47.909 --> 35:51.003
This equation, due mainly to
Frank Drake of Cornell...

35:51.212 --> 35:52.873
...is only a sentence.

35:53.080 --> 35:55.708
The verb is "equals."

35:55.917 --> 36:00.251
So let's try to go through
the program of this equation.

36:00.455 --> 36:03.049
By carefully counting
the number of stars...

36:03.257 --> 36:06.124
...in small but representative regions
of the sky...

36:06.327 --> 36:10.024
...we find that the total number
of stars in the Milky Way...

36:10.231 --> 36:15.134
...is about 400 billion.

36:15.336 --> 36:17.133
That's a lot of stars.

36:17.338 --> 36:18.669
What about planets?

36:18.873 --> 36:22.240
Well, in studies of double stars...

36:22.443 --> 36:26.743
...and investigations of
the motions of nearby stars...

36:26.948 --> 36:28.745
...and in many theoretical studies...

36:28.950 --> 36:33.546
...we get a strong hint that many...

36:33.754 --> 36:35.722
...perhaps even most stars...

36:35.923 --> 36:37.515
...are accompanied by planets.

36:37.725 --> 36:39.955
So let's take f sub-p...

36:40.161 --> 36:44.825
...the fraction of stars that
have planets as a quarter.

36:45.700 --> 36:48.897
Then, the total number of
planetary systems in the galaxy...

36:49.103 --> 36:52.095
...is 400 billion times a quarter...

36:52.306 --> 36:54.365
...or 100 billion.

36:54.575 --> 36:58.568
We'll write down our running totals
in red.

36:59.180 --> 37:01.307
Now if each system were
to have, say...

37:01.516 --> 37:05.612
...ten planets as ours does, there
would be 100 billion times ten...

37:05.820 --> 37:08.118
...or a trillion worlds in the galaxy.

37:08.322 --> 37:12.782
A vast arena for the cosmic drama.

37:13.227 --> 37:14.956
In our own solar system...

37:15.162 --> 37:18.529
...there are several bodies that
might be suitable for life...

37:18.733 --> 37:19.893
...life of some sort.

37:20.101 --> 37:21.864
There's the Earth, of course...

37:22.069 --> 37:26.506
...but there are possibilities for
Mars, for Titan, perhaps for Jupiter.

37:26.707 --> 37:31.235
If other systems are similar, there
may be many suitable worlds per system.

37:31.445 --> 37:33.777
But to be conservative,
let's choose...

37:33.981 --> 37:36.347
...n sub-e equal two.

37:36.551 --> 37:38.712
Two worlds suitable for life
per system.

37:39.020 --> 37:41.284
The planets that are
suitable for life...

37:41.489 --> 37:44.686
...would be 100 billion times
two, or 200 billion.

37:45.159 --> 37:46.626
Now what about life?

37:46.827 --> 37:48.852
Under very general
cosmic conditions...

37:49.063 --> 37:53.932
...the molecules of life are readily
made and spontaneously self-assemble.

37:54.135 --> 37:57.571
It's conceivable there might be
some impediment, like some...

37:57.772 --> 38:00.502
...difficulty in the origin of
the genetic code, say.

38:00.708 --> 38:04.337
Although that's very unlikely, given
billions of years for evolution.

38:04.545 --> 38:08.879
On the Earth, life arose very fast
after the planet was formed.

38:09.083 --> 38:11.608
So let's choose f sub-I...

38:11.819 --> 38:16.381
...the fraction of suitable worlds in
which life does arise, as a half.

38:16.757 --> 38:21.251
The number of planets in the Milky Way
in which life has arisen once...

38:21.596 --> 38:24.724
...is 100 billion times
two, times a half.

38:24.932 --> 38:26.399
Or again, 100 billion.

38:29.170 --> 38:33.539
100 billion inhabited worlds.

38:34.208 --> 38:37.735
Now the estimates get tougher.

38:38.179 --> 38:41.205
Many individually unlikely events
had to occur for...

38:41.415 --> 38:44.578
...our species and our technology
to emerge.

38:44.819 --> 38:47.811
On the other hand, there might
be many different roads...

38:48.022 --> 38:49.785
...to high technology.

38:49.991 --> 38:51.891
Some scientists think that...

38:52.093 --> 38:55.995
...the path from trilobites to radio
telescopes, or the equivalent...

38:56.197 --> 38:58.722
...goes like a shot
in all planetary systems.

38:58.933 --> 39:00.833
Other scientists disagree.

39:01.035 --> 39:04.630
Let's take some middle ground
and choose f sub-i...

39:05.339 --> 39:06.806
...as a tenth...

39:07.008 --> 39:10.603
...and f sub-c as also a tenth.

39:10.811 --> 39:13.678
Meaning that only one percent,
a tenth times a tenth...

39:13.881 --> 39:17.442
...of inhabited planets eventually
produce a technical civilization.

39:18.352 --> 39:21.844
If we were to multiply
all these factors together...

39:22.056 --> 39:25.617
...we would find 100 billion
times a tenth times a tenth.

39:25.826 --> 39:29.887
Or one billion planets...

39:30.698 --> 39:35.158
...on which civilizations
have arisen at least once.

39:36.203 --> 39:40.162
Now what percentage of
the lifetime of a planet...

39:40.374 --> 39:43.343
...is marked by a technical
civilization?

39:43.577 --> 39:46.910
Earth has harbored a civilization
capable of radio astronomy...

39:47.114 --> 39:49.674
...only for a few decades,
the last few...

39:49.884 --> 39:52.717
...out of a lifetime of
a few billion years.

39:52.920 --> 39:55.480
It's hardly out of the question
that we might...

39:55.690 --> 39:57.658
...destroy ourselves tomorrow.

39:57.858 --> 40:02.295
If that's a typical case,
then f sub-L...

40:02.496 --> 40:06.694
...would be a few decades divided
by a few billion years...

40:06.901 --> 40:10.837
...or one hundred millionth...

40:11.038 --> 40:13.006
...a very small number.

40:13.708 --> 40:16.802
And then, N would be a billion
times a hundred millionth.

40:17.011 --> 40:21.948
Or N may be just...

40:22.183 --> 40:24.014
...ten civilizations.

40:24.218 --> 40:27.278
A tiny smattering, a pitiful few...

40:27.488 --> 40:30.514
...technological civilizations
in the galaxy.

40:31.692 --> 40:33.853
But civilizations then...

40:34.061 --> 40:37.553
...might take billions of years
of tortuous evolution to arise...

40:37.765 --> 40:40.893
...and then snuff themselves out
in an instant of...

40:41.102 --> 40:43.036
...unforgivable neglect.

40:43.237 --> 40:44.727
If this is a typical case...

40:44.939 --> 40:46.702
...there may be few others...

40:46.907 --> 40:49.842
...maybe nobody else at all
for us to talk to.

40:54.181 --> 40:56.012
But consider the alternative:

40:56.217 --> 41:00.483
That occasionally civilizations
learn to live with high technology...

41:00.688 --> 41:04.283
...and survive for geological or
stellar evolutionary time scales.

41:04.492 --> 41:07.655
If only one percent
of civilizations can...

41:07.862 --> 41:10.854
...survive technological
adolescence...

41:11.265 --> 41:15.998
...then f sub-L would be
not 100 millionth...

41:16.203 --> 41:18.433
...but only a hundredth.

41:18.639 --> 41:23.576
And then the number of civilizations
would be a billion times a hundredth.

41:23.844 --> 41:27.109
The civilizations in the galaxy
would be measured...

41:27.314 --> 41:29.544
...in the millions.

41:31.085 --> 41:34.384
Millions of technical civilizations.

41:38.959 --> 41:42.827
So if civilizations do not
always destroy themselves...

41:43.030 --> 41:45.897
...shortly after discovering
radio astronomy...

41:46.100 --> 41:49.365
...then the sky may be
softly humming...

41:49.570 --> 41:51.834
...with messages from the stars...

41:52.039 --> 41:55.133
...with signals from civilizations
enormously older...

41:55.342 --> 41:57.640
...and wiser than we.

42:00.114 --> 42:03.481
If there are millions of civilizations
in the Milky Way...

42:03.684 --> 42:05.675
...each capable of radio astronomy...

42:05.886 --> 42:09.014
...how far away is the nearest one?

42:15.196 --> 42:18.324
If they're distributed randomly
through space...

42:18.799 --> 42:22.565
...then the nearest one will be
some 200 light-years away.

42:22.970 --> 42:24.699
But within 200 light-years...

42:24.905 --> 42:28.068
...there are hundreds
of thousands of stars.

42:28.275 --> 42:30.743
To find the needle in this haystack...

42:30.945 --> 42:34.574
...requires a dedicated
and systematic search.

42:38.285 --> 42:42.415
Many cosmic radio sources have nothing
to do with intelligent life.

42:42.623 --> 42:47.560
So how would we know that
we were receiving a message?

42:51.232 --> 42:55.760
The transmitting civilization can make
it very easy for us, if they wished.

42:55.970 --> 42:59.497
Imagine we're in the course
of a systematic search.

42:59.707 --> 43:03.643
Or in the midst of some more
conventional observations.

43:03.844 --> 43:05.744
And suppose one day...

43:05.946 --> 43:08.744
...we find a strong signal
slowly emerging.

43:08.949 --> 43:11.440
Not just some background hiss...

43:11.652 --> 43:16.214
...but a methodical series of pulses.

43:16.423 --> 43:18.823
(SIGNAL PINGS)

43:20.027 --> 43:23.121
The numbers one, two, three, five...

43:23.330 --> 43:26.595
...seven, eleven, thirteen.

43:26.800 --> 43:28.961
A signal made of prime numbers.

43:29.169 --> 43:33.265
Numbers divisible only
by one and themselves.

43:36.477 --> 43:40.846
There is no natural astrophysical
process that generates prime numbers.

43:41.048 --> 43:42.606
We would have to conclude...

43:42.816 --> 43:46.149
...that someone fond of
elementary mathematics...

43:46.353 --> 43:48.947
...was saying hello.

43:49.390 --> 43:51.915
(SIGNAL PINGS)

43:54.828 --> 43:58.457
This would be no more than a beacon
to attract our attention.

43:58.666 --> 44:01.066
The main message will be subtler...

44:01.268 --> 44:03.736
...more hidden, far richer.

44:03.938 --> 44:06.600
We may have to work hard to find it.

44:10.945 --> 44:15.006
But the beacon signal alone
would be profoundly significant.

44:15.215 --> 44:20.084
It would mean someone has learned to
survive technological adolescence...

44:20.287 --> 44:23.279
...that self-destruction
is not inevitable...

44:23.490 --> 44:26.891
...that we also may have a future.

44:31.732 --> 44:34.132
Such knowledge, it seems to me...

44:34.535 --> 44:37.368
...might be worth a great price.

44:40.908 --> 44:41.875
Very likely...

44:42.076 --> 44:44.636
...some new Champollion
would go on...

44:44.845 --> 44:49.009
...to decode the main message,
using our interstellar Rosetta Stone:

44:49.216 --> 44:52.481
The common language of science
and mathematics.

44:57.491 --> 45:00.722
Think of the glories of
an exotic civilization...

45:00.928 --> 45:03.192
...far more advanced than we...

45:03.397 --> 45:07.629
...collected by the great
radio telescopes of Earth.

45:07.835 --> 45:12.738
Perhaps they'd send a compilation of
the knowledge of a million worlds:

45:12.940 --> 45:15.932
The Encyclopedia Galactica.

45:20.047 --> 45:22.072
Receiving an interstellar message...

45:22.282 --> 45:24.910
...would be a major event
in human history...

45:25.119 --> 45:30.056
...and the beginning of the
deprovincialization of our planet.

45:36.430 --> 45:39.126
A serious and systematic
radio search...

45:39.333 --> 45:43.360
...for extraterrestrial
civilizations may come soon.

45:43.570 --> 45:46.733
Preliminary steps are being taken
both in the United States...

45:46.940 --> 45:49.101
...and in the Soviet Union.

45:50.844 --> 45:52.971
It's comparatively inexpensive.

45:53.180 --> 45:58.117
A search taking decades would cost
less than the budget overruns...

45:58.318 --> 46:02.652
...on a single modest weapons system
in a single year.

46:05.359 --> 46:08.817
Our technology is now
fully adequate...

46:09.029 --> 46:11.054
...for this great challenge.

46:11.265 --> 46:13.426
But no systematic search program...

46:13.634 --> 46:17.502
...has ever been approved
by any nation on Earth.

46:20.541 --> 46:23.169
When will we decide to search for...

46:23.377 --> 46:28.110
...what other civilizations there
may be in the vast cosmic ocean?

46:33.821 --> 46:37.689
But whether there are only a few
advanced galactic civilizations...

46:37.891 --> 46:39.188
...or millions...

46:39.393 --> 46:43.591
...shouldn't some of them
have voyaged to Earth?

46:49.069 --> 46:53.438
On one hand, if even a small fraction
of technical civilizations...

46:53.640 --> 46:57.371
...learned to live with their
potential for self-destruction...

46:57.578 --> 47:00.741
...there should be enormous
numbers of them in the galaxy.

47:01.315 --> 47:05.809
On the other hand, despite claims
about UFOs and ancient astronauts...

47:06.019 --> 47:10.080
...there's no creditable evidence that
Earth has been visited, now or ever.

47:10.557 --> 47:12.787
But isn't this a contradiction?

47:12.993 --> 47:16.793
If the nearest civilization is,
say, 200 light-years away...

47:16.997 --> 47:20.398
...it'd take them only 200 years
to get from there to here...

47:20.601 --> 47:21.829
...at light speed.

47:22.035 --> 47:25.129
Even if they were traveling
1000 times slower than that...

47:25.339 --> 47:28.206
...aliens could've come here during...

47:28.408 --> 47:30.638
...the tenure of human beings
on Earth.

47:30.844 --> 47:32.709
So why aren't they here?

47:33.580 --> 47:36.413
There's many possible answers.
One is that...

47:36.617 --> 47:38.209
...maybe we're the first.

47:38.418 --> 47:41.285
Some technical civilization
has to be first...

47:41.488 --> 47:43.888
...to emerge in the history
of the galaxy.

47:44.091 --> 47:48.585
Or maybe all technical civilizations
promptly destroy themselves.

47:48.795 --> 47:51.161
That seems to me very unlikely.

47:51.365 --> 47:53.560
Maybe there's some problem
with space flight...

47:53.767 --> 47:56.292
...that we've been too dumb
to figure out.

47:56.503 --> 48:00.803
Or maybe they are here,
but in hiding...

48:01.008 --> 48:03.602
...because of an ethic of
non-interference...

48:03.810 --> 48:05.675
...with emerging civilizations.

48:05.879 --> 48:10.009
We might imagine them,
curious and dispassionate...

48:10.217 --> 48:13.653
...watching us to determine
whether this year again...

48:13.854 --> 48:15.879
...we manage to avoid
self-destruction.

48:16.757 --> 48:21.660
But there's another explanation which
is consistent with what we know.

48:21.895 --> 48:25.296
And that's that it's a big cosmos.

48:25.499 --> 48:30.095
If years ago, an advanced interstellar
spacefaring civilization emerged...

48:30.304 --> 48:33.273
...200 light-years away,
why would they come here?

48:33.640 --> 48:36.438
They'd have no reason to think
the Earth was special.

48:36.643 --> 48:41.307
There are no signs of technology,
not even our radio transmissions...

48:41.515 --> 48:44.211
...which have had time
to go 200 light-years.

48:44.418 --> 48:47.649
From their point of view,
all nearby planetary systems...

48:47.854 --> 48:51.290
...might seem equally attractive
for exploration.

48:54.795 --> 48:58.390
How would an interstellar
civilization set out to explore...

48:58.599 --> 49:01.227
...its neighboring star systems?

49:02.269 --> 49:04.533
It might establish staging posts...

49:04.738 --> 49:07.468
...colonies,
on planets of nearby stars.

49:07.674 --> 49:09.301
But this would take time.

49:09.509 --> 49:12.342
Time to find and modify
favorable planets.

49:12.546 --> 49:14.707
Time to build new spacecraft.

49:15.916 --> 49:19.875
Eventually, later generations
of explorers would set out...

49:20.087 --> 49:22.180
...wending their way
among the worlds...

49:22.389 --> 49:25.051
...creating an interstellar
nervous system...

49:25.259 --> 49:27.318
...binding up the stars.

49:28.028 --> 49:31.088
Perhaps they'd come upon another
expanding civilization...

49:31.298 --> 49:33.766
...and encounter beings
previously known...

49:33.967 --> 49:36.731
...only from their radio
transmissions.

49:36.937 --> 49:38.996
Star wars are unlikely.

49:39.206 --> 49:43.074
One civilization certainly would be
far more advanced than the other.

49:43.277 --> 49:45.575
It would be no contest.

49:48.615 --> 49:50.310
Perhaps they would cooperate...

49:50.517 --> 49:55.284
...exploring together a small province
of the Milky Way.

49:59.860 --> 50:03.318
But even nearby civilizations
could spend millions of years...

50:03.530 --> 50:05.589
...roving between the stars...

50:05.799 --> 50:10.736
...without ever stumbling upon
our obscure solar system.

50:12.072 --> 50:15.906
In a galaxy of 400 billion suns...

50:16.109 --> 50:19.806
...perhaps no one has found us
just yet.

50:21.615 --> 50:25.745
Advanced interstellar civilizations
would know about many worlds.

50:25.952 --> 50:28.614
Some inhabited, some barren.

50:28.822 --> 50:31.154
Perhaps they would share
their findings...

50:31.358 --> 50:34.452
...assembling some vast repository...

50:34.661 --> 50:37.630
...of the knowledge of
countless worlds.

50:37.831 --> 50:42.768
They might compile an
Encyclopedia Galactica.

50:44.404 --> 50:48.465
Suppose we could browse through
that encyclopedia.

50:54.381 --> 50:58.340
We would choose some nearby
province of the galaxy...

50:58.552 --> 51:01.214
...a region that's fairly
well-explored.

51:01.421 --> 51:06.017
And then slowly leaf through
the worlds.

51:26.913 --> 51:29.438
The young Champollion was inspired...

51:29.649 --> 51:33.141
...by reading Fourier's
description of Egypt.

51:33.353 --> 51:35.082
Imagine the impact on us...

51:35.288 --> 51:38.018
...if we could study
a rich compilation...

51:38.225 --> 51:40.523
...of not merely one world...

51:40.727 --> 51:42.490
...but billions.

52:19.232 --> 52:23.225
Just possibly, not too far
from our solar system...

52:23.437 --> 52:25.997
...we might find
a technical civilization...

52:26.206 --> 52:29.107
...only a little more
advanced than we.

52:29.309 --> 52:33.473
Let's look them up in
the Galactic Encyclopedia.

53:10.917 --> 53:14.580
What would a civilization
far more advanced than ours...

53:14.788 --> 53:16.255
...be up to?

53:19.893 --> 53:22.384
There may be engineering on a scale...

53:22.596 --> 53:25.565
...that dwarfs our proudest
achievements.

53:25.765 --> 53:29.599
There may be cultures that disassemble
other planets in their system...

53:29.803 --> 53:33.204
...and reassemble them around
their world to make a ring...

53:33.573 --> 53:37.134
...or a shell with
their planet inside.

53:49.456 --> 53:54.393
Imagine the energy crisis of a really
advanced planetary civilization.

53:54.628 --> 53:56.459
They've used up all their fuels.

53:56.663 --> 53:58.790
They depend on solar power.

53:58.999 --> 54:02.628
But their growth is still severely
limited by the energy available.

54:02.836 --> 54:06.169
An enormous amount of energy
is generated by the local star.

54:06.373 --> 54:10.070
But most of the star's light
doesn't fall on their planet.

54:10.277 --> 54:13.371
So perhaps they would build a shell...

54:13.580 --> 54:15.445
...to surround their star...

54:15.649 --> 54:19.449
...and harvest every photon
of sunlight.

54:20.754 --> 54:23.689
Such beings, such civilizations...

54:23.890 --> 54:27.382
...would bear little resemblance
to anything we know.

54:53.720 --> 54:58.657
Perhaps someday there will be an entry
in the Encyclopedia Galactica...

54:58.925 --> 55:00.654
...for our planet.

55:00.860 --> 55:03.761
Or perhaps even now
there exists somewhere...

55:03.964 --> 55:08.264
...a planetary dossier, garnered
from our television broadcasts...

55:08.468 --> 55:11.266
...or from some discreet
survey mission.

55:11.471 --> 55:15.908
They may summon up the index of blue
worlds in our part of the Milky Way...

55:16.109 --> 55:18.873
...until they came to
the listing for Earth.

55:19.079 --> 55:21.639
What would they know about us?

55:27.020 --> 55:29.113
What would they think of us?

55:49.709 --> 55:53.236
We have always watched
the stars and mused...

55:53.446 --> 55:57.974
...about whether there are other
beings who think and wonder.

56:00.687 --> 56:03.019
In a cosmic setting vast and old...

56:03.223 --> 56:07.853
...beyond ordinary human
understanding, we are a little lonely.

56:12.732 --> 56:17.192
In the deepest sense, the search
for extraterrestrial intelligence...

56:17.404 --> 56:20.532
...is a search for who we are.

56:28.982 --> 56:30.779
Since Cosmos was released...

56:30.984 --> 56:34.181
...interest in UFOs has persisted.

56:34.387 --> 56:37.254
It seems to me that there
are fewer sightings of...

56:37.457 --> 56:40.017
...strange objects in the skies
these days...

56:40.226 --> 56:44.959
...and more stories of encounters
with alleged extraterrestrials...

56:45.165 --> 56:49.261
...like the account of Betty and Barney
Hill that we dramatized.

56:49.469 --> 56:52.927
There are still people who claim
to have been abducted by aliens...

56:53.139 --> 56:57.337
...or even sexually abused,
or even impregnated by them.

56:57.544 --> 57:02.481
Best-selling purportedly serious books
have been written about such claims.

57:02.749 --> 57:06.241
But the critical fact remains
that all we have still is...

57:06.453 --> 57:07.681
...just anecdote.

57:07.887 --> 57:10.378
There are no close-up photos,
no artifacts...

57:10.590 --> 57:12.581
...nothing that'd convince a skeptic.

57:13.193 --> 57:15.423
All there are is stories.

57:15.628 --> 57:19.724
And stories just aren't good enough
on a matter of this importance.

57:19.933 --> 57:22.458
I'm still waiting for hard evidence.

57:23.002 --> 57:27.666
The radio search for extraterrestrial
intelligence has been picking up.

57:27.874 --> 57:31.742
In Harvard, Massachusetts, a radio
telescope monitoring 8 million...

57:31.945 --> 57:33.640
...separate radio channels...

57:33.847 --> 57:36.782
...has been scanning the skies
for signals.

57:36.983 --> 57:40.544
This program, called META,
is supported entirely by...

57:40.754 --> 57:43.780
...the Pasadena, California-based
Planetary Society.

57:43.990 --> 57:46.584
Paid for by members' contributions.

57:46.793 --> 57:49.091
A similar planetary society search...

57:49.295 --> 57:53.459
...to examine the southern skies
and the center of the Milky Way...

57:53.666 --> 57:56.100
...is to be performed in Argentina.

57:56.302 --> 57:59.271
These searches are by far...

57:59.472 --> 58:02.168
...the most sophisticated
ever attempted.

58:02.375 --> 58:04.707
A much more sensitive program...

58:04.911 --> 58:08.369
...covering almost the entire
accessible radio spectrum...

58:08.581 --> 58:10.572
...is to be mustered by NASA.

58:11.785 --> 58:14.811
The search for extraterrestrial
intelligence is central...

58:15.021 --> 58:18.684
...to our understanding of the universe
and our view of ourselves.

58:18.892 --> 58:20.587
It's well worth doing.

58:20.794 --> 58:22.887
But the simple fact is that...

58:23.096 --> 58:27.362
...while we may consider
extraterrestrial intelligence likely...

58:27.567 --> 58:31.059
...there is as yet
no evidence at all...

58:31.271 --> 58:32.670
...that it exists.

58:33.006 --> 58:35.201
The search continues.
