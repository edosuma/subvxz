WEBVTT

00:00.914 --> 00:02.601
Over 68 million Americans

00:02.654 --> 00:05.118
leave the safety of
our borders every year.

00:05.156 --> 00:06.796
If danger strikes,

00:07.070 --> 00:09.666
The FBI's International Response Team

00:09.822 --> 00:11.535
is called into action.

00:13.000 --> 00:19.074

00:23.858 --> 00:25.310
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:25.341 --> 00:28.154
we're beginning our initial
descent into Singapore.

00:28.272 --> 00:30.872
If you would, please bring
your seatbacks and tray tables

00:30.874 --> 00:32.454
to their upright and locked position.

00:32.500 --> 00:33.524
Thank you.

00:33.680 --> 00:36.969
Mm, it says here that Singapore
is a completely planned society.

00:37.048 --> 00:39.515
It was built from almost
nothing after World War II

00:39.517 --> 00:41.584
and a focus on commerce and nationalism

00:41.647 --> 00:45.821
has made it the most prosperous
country in southeast Asia.

00:45.823 --> 00:48.257
I married a reader.

00:51.462 --> 00:52.895
Hi, excuse me.

00:52.897 --> 00:54.430
You're just gonna have to
turn that off for landing.

00:54.432 --> 00:56.298
Sorry, he doesn't fly.

00:56.300 --> 00:57.867
Is this your first time in Singapore?

00:57.869 --> 00:59.301
It's our first time outside Akron.

00:59.303 --> 01:01.270
Any advice? Where should we eat?

01:01.272 --> 01:02.905
Well, I always like Kampong Glam,

01:02.907 --> 01:04.673
but since this is your first time,

01:04.675 --> 01:06.375
you have to check out Maxwell Road.

01:06.377 --> 01:07.810
They have the best chicken rice.

01:07.812 --> 01:09.712
Thanks, we'll check it out.

01:11.115 --> 01:14.216
That's like the third person
who's recommended chicken rice.

01:14.218 --> 01:15.985
How good could it be?

01:15.987 --> 01:19.855
This from the guy that considers
chili with noodles a delicacy.

01:22.527 --> 01:24.827
Thank God for a three-day turnaround.

01:24.829 --> 01:26.428
What do you say, ladies?
Want to hit up the clubs?

01:26.430 --> 01:27.796
You're the only man that I know

01:27.798 --> 01:30.399
that can follow up a 16-hour
trans-pac with a night out.

01:30.401 --> 01:33.769
I'm gonna spend the next 72
hours the way God intended...

01:33.771 --> 01:36.972
Poolside with a martini.

01:36.974 --> 01:39.341
Are you girls holding out on me?

01:39.343 --> 01:42.584
And here I thought we were young.

01:52.623 --> 01:54.990
Here we are in Singapore.

01:54.992 --> 01:58.761
The highlight of which thus
far has been the people movers.

01:58.763 --> 02:01.964
Lisa, you got anything
for the folks back home?

02:01.966 --> 02:03.732
Hi, folks.

02:03.734 --> 02:06.969
Honey... get the bags.

02:06.971 --> 02:08.804
Yeah.

02:24.822 --> 02:27.223
Edward!

02:27.225 --> 02:29.918
Jane Wicks, a flight attendant
with Oceanic Airlines,

02:29.996 --> 02:32.695
had just arrived in
country on flight 815.

02:32.697 --> 02:33.896
Singapore police suspect

02:33.898 --> 02:36.131
her co-worker Kathy Hall of the murder.

02:36.133 --> 02:39.635
Security cameras caught Kathy
fleeing the scene of the crime.

02:39.637 --> 02:42.104
Check this out.

02:42.106 --> 02:43.572
That's blood.

02:43.574 --> 02:45.207
She then exited the airport

02:45.209 --> 02:48.477
through an emergency door
and disappeared into the city.

02:48.479 --> 02:51.647
Well, clear evidence of a crime
and positive ID of a suspect.

02:51.649 --> 02:53.682
Why does Singapore PD need our help?

02:53.684 --> 02:57.319
The country experiences
fewer than 10 murders a year.

02:57.321 --> 03:00.389
An American victim and an
American suspect at large...

03:00.391 --> 03:01.523
State Department has asked

03:01.525 --> 03:03.659
that we make sure
everything goes by the book.

03:03.661 --> 03:05.461
Yeah, well, to keep crime low,

03:05.463 --> 03:06.762
Singapore's justice system

03:06.764 --> 03:08.631
is intentionally swift and severe.

03:08.633 --> 03:10.799
There's no such thing as trial by jury.

03:10.801 --> 03:13.269
Judges have been known
to pass harsh sentences

03:13.271 --> 03:15.237
for foreigners who commit crimes.

03:15.239 --> 03:17.306
Like chewing bubble gum,

03:17.308 --> 03:19.362
which is illegal, by the way.

03:20.487 --> 03:22.945
Isn't Singapore where that kid was caned

03:22.947 --> 03:24.313
for being drunk in public?

03:24.315 --> 03:25.144
Yeah.

03:25.152 --> 03:26.332
In 1993,

03:26.355 --> 03:27.902
an American college
student was convicted

03:27.949 --> 03:30.352
of public intoxication and vandalism.

03:30.354 --> 03:32.421
He maintains to this
day that he was coerced

03:32.423 --> 03:34.523
by Singapore police
into a false confession.

03:34.525 --> 03:36.925
Well, it's gonna be much
worse for Kathy Hall.

03:36.927 --> 03:40.195
When caught, she's most likely
gonna face an expedited trial

03:40.197 --> 03:41.797
and then execution by hanging.

03:41.799 --> 03:43.532
Well, running certainly implies guilt,

03:43.534 --> 03:45.834
and that's all that Singapore
courts are gonna need.

03:45.836 --> 03:47.436
So, was this a crime of opportunity,

03:47.438 --> 03:49.138
or did Kathy kill Jane in cold blood?

03:49.140 --> 03:50.739
That's on us to find out.

03:50.741 --> 03:52.708
Clearly, there are differences

03:52.710 --> 03:55.778
between the Singaporean
system and our own.

03:55.780 --> 03:57.279
So, for the sake of justice,

03:57.281 --> 03:59.515
let's make sure that due process is had

03:59.517 --> 04:01.650
for both the victim and the accused,

04:01.652 --> 04:05.120
or soon, we could very
easily have two dead Americans

04:05.122 --> 04:06.689
on our hands.

04:34.231 --> 04:36.796
A Singaporean proverb tells us,

04:37.066 --> 04:41.635
“Where there is a sea,
there are pirates.”

04:42.338 --> 04:44.838
Flight landed at 5:12.

04:44.840 --> 04:47.677
At 5:41, Jane Wicks and Kathy Hall

04:47.811 --> 04:50.812
carded into a secure
area of baggage claim.

04:50.814 --> 04:52.714
And the body came out on a conveyor?

04:52.716 --> 04:54.182
Six minutes later.

04:54.184 --> 04:56.751
We ruled out ground crew
and other passengers.

04:56.753 --> 04:58.119
Kathy Hall is the only one

04:58.121 --> 05:00.254
who could have committed this crime.

05:00.256 --> 05:03.387
I know you presume a suspect
innocent until proven otherwise,

05:03.418 --> 05:07.462
but in Singapore, Kathy
Hall enjoy no such rights.

05:08.898 --> 05:10.965
Our top priority is to locate

05:10.967 --> 05:13.901
and apprehend Ms. Hall
as quickly as possible.

05:13.903 --> 05:16.971
Your presence here can only
complicate this investigation.

05:16.973 --> 05:18.339
Station Inspector Cheong...

05:18.341 --> 05:20.174
Senior Station Inspector.

05:20.176 --> 05:21.509
Of course.

05:21.511 --> 05:25.646
The IRT has no interest in
slowing down your investigation.

05:25.648 --> 05:27.515
But we owe it to the deceased

05:27.517 --> 05:30.418
to understand why and how
this murder took place.

05:30.420 --> 05:33.154
We believe the two women
got into an argument,

05:33.156 --> 05:36.357
and escalated until Kathy
Hall killed Jane Wicks

05:36.359 --> 05:38.092
in a fit of rage.

05:38.094 --> 05:39.293
While that is plausible,

05:39.295 --> 05:41.596
we's still like to talk to
as many flight-crew members

05:41.598 --> 05:42.697
and witnesses as possible.

05:42.699 --> 05:44.165
I will make the arrangements.

05:44.167 --> 05:46.734
Any indication of where
she went when she left?

05:46.736 --> 05:48.403
No. That is concerning.

05:48.405 --> 05:51.224
Now, in the interest
of national security,

05:51.287 --> 05:53.341
Singapore has security cameras

05:53.343 --> 05:56.210
at virtually every
intersection of the city.

05:56.212 --> 05:59.380
For someone to disappear in
thin air like this woman...

05:59.382 --> 06:01.549
... would take knowledge and planning.

06:01.551 --> 06:04.252
She seems to know where every camera is

06:04.254 --> 06:05.987
and how to avoid them.

06:05.989 --> 06:07.188
So, this may have been more

06:07.190 --> 06:09.290
than just an argument
that got out of hand.

06:09.292 --> 06:10.658
This may have been planned.

06:10.660 --> 06:13.728
With all due respect, we
know who the killer is.

06:13.730 --> 06:15.797
Now, how does further
review of the events

06:15.799 --> 06:17.799
help us get any closer to finding her?

06:17.801 --> 06:20.902
Inspector Cheong,
Singapore PD has officers

06:20.904 --> 06:23.538
all over the city looking
for Ms. Hall, do they not?

06:23.540 --> 06:24.872
Of course.

06:24.874 --> 06:27.508
And if you catch her,
the investigation is over,

06:27.510 --> 06:30.578
but if you don't, we'd like to
build a profile of the killer,

06:30.580 --> 06:32.914
and that may help tell
us where she's headed.

06:32.916 --> 06:36.551
In order to catch a fish,
you got to think like a fish.

06:36.553 --> 06:38.820
Who are you again?

06:38.822 --> 06:39.854
I'm Matt Simmons.

06:39.856 --> 06:42.156
I do physical evidence and tracking.

06:42.158 --> 06:43.991
I'd like to take a look
at your murder scene.

06:43.993 --> 06:46.127
Come with me.

06:46.129 --> 06:48.062
Okay, victimology.

06:48.064 --> 06:50.364
According to a
Homeland-Security profile,

06:50.366 --> 06:51.833
Jane Wicks grew up outside

06:51.835 --> 06:54.569
of a middle-class neighborhood
in Kansas City, Missouri.

06:54.571 --> 06:56.471
She went to Bard College
in upstate New York

06:56.473 --> 06:58.539
before moving to Washington
D.C. in her early 20s.

06:58.541 --> 07:00.675
Her parents, Clyde and Deborah,

07:00.677 --> 07:03.277
were devastated to hear
about their daughter's death,

07:03.279 --> 07:05.279
but they did say that there's no way

07:05.281 --> 07:07.215
that Kathy Hall could be the killer.

07:07.217 --> 07:08.950
Apparently, the two women were close.

07:08.952 --> 07:10.518
What do we know about the suspect?

07:10.520 --> 07:12.420
Uh... Kathy Hall... orphan.

07:12.422 --> 07:14.055
She was born in Baltimore, Maryland,

07:14.057 --> 07:16.090
and raised primarily in
the foster-care system

07:16.092 --> 07:17.391
and group homes.

07:17.393 --> 07:18.893
She dropped out of high school,

07:18.895 --> 07:22.296
got her GED while working
as a convenience store clerk.

07:22.298 --> 07:23.764
Her only family is her brother,

07:23.766 --> 07:25.867
who I'm having a hard
time trying to locate.

07:25.869 --> 07:27.935
He had a methamphetamine bust in '05,

07:27.937 --> 07:29.537
but outside of that, his record's clean.

07:29.539 --> 07:32.340
Despite a rocking upbringing,
Kathy pulled herself up.

07:32.342 --> 07:33.908
She got a job as a flight attendant.

07:33.910 --> 07:36.878
Yeah. According to social media,
she's been living the life.

07:36.880 --> 07:39.947
Jane and Kathy met in
flight-attendant training in 2009.

07:39.949 --> 07:41.377
The two have been working together

07:41.455 --> 07:44.752
on the BWI-Singapore route
since a year ago, last January.

07:44.754 --> 07:48.189
So, two women, wildly
different backgrounds.

07:48.191 --> 07:50.836
They meet, become
friends, travel the world.

07:50.867 --> 07:52.226
I can relate.

07:52.228 --> 07:53.561
Boom.

07:53.563 --> 07:56.197
So, where did it go wrong?

07:56.199 --> 07:59.467
Mae, you head to the morgue,
assist with the autopsy.

07:59.469 --> 08:02.637
Clara and I will start to
interview some of the witnesses.

08:06.209 --> 08:09.577
How well did you know Jane and Kathy?

08:09.579 --> 08:11.579
I joined the flight
crew about a year ago.

08:11.581 --> 08:12.813
We were friends.

08:12.815 --> 08:15.550
Would you describe their
relationship as close?

08:15.552 --> 08:17.318
Those two were thick as thieves.

08:17.320 --> 08:20.021
At least I thought they were.

08:24.661 --> 08:27.562
Some of the other passengers
reported hearing them argue.

08:27.564 --> 08:28.977
Do you know what that was about?

08:29.000 --> 08:30.932
They were talking about some guy.

08:30.934 --> 08:33.833
Dead girl didn't like whoever
the other one was dating.

08:33.836 --> 08:35.236
Did he call you back?

08:35.238 --> 08:37.304
How? We're at 30,000 feet in the air.

08:37.307 --> 08:38.972
I'm telling you, he's a liar.

08:38.975 --> 08:40.808
You can't trust him.

08:42.845 --> 08:43.744
You know how it is.

08:43.746 --> 08:45.146
Work enough long-haul flights,

08:45.148 --> 08:46.981
you're bound to have your differences.

08:46.983 --> 08:48.716
Tell me about the boyfriend.

08:48.718 --> 08:49.684
Did you meet him?

08:49.686 --> 08:52.753
Prince Charming? Man, he was hot.

08:52.755 --> 08:55.523
Rode into first class and
swept her off her feet.

08:55.525 --> 08:58.492
Was that a source of tension
between Jane and Kathy?

08:58.494 --> 08:59.727
Because of Scott?

08:59.729 --> 09:01.195
Maybe a little jealousy,

09:01.197 --> 09:03.431
but nothing worth killing over.

09:03.433 --> 09:05.399
It was a total cold war.

09:05.401 --> 09:07.435
I mean, they weren't
being obvious about it,

09:07.437 --> 09:09.837
but you've seen one girl
fight, you know the signs.

09:09.839 --> 09:12.873
- Really?
- Honey, I love you.

09:12.875 --> 09:14.775
Sometimes you're just oblivious.

09:14.777 --> 09:17.178
It was definitely about the boyfriend.

09:21.217 --> 09:23.284
Fight... about me?

09:23.286 --> 09:24.785
There's no way.

09:24.787 --> 09:28.522
Agent Montgomery, I promise
you, Kathy didn't kill Jane.

09:28.524 --> 09:30.758
Okay, take it back to the beginning.

09:30.760 --> 09:32.627
How did you and Kathy meet?

09:32.629 --> 09:33.728
Well, I'm an art broker,

09:33.730 --> 09:35.119
so I do a lot of international travel,

09:35.158 --> 09:38.232
and last year, I was on Kathy's
route to Singapore a lot.

09:38.234 --> 09:41.035
And Well, you know how it is.

09:41.037 --> 09:42.570
Cute girl, hard worker...

09:42.572 --> 09:45.806
She built herself up from nothing.

09:45.808 --> 09:46.941
I was impressed.

09:46.943 --> 09:48.609
And how well did you know Jane?

09:48.611 --> 09:51.012
We were friends... Well, friendly.

09:51.014 --> 09:53.147
Was there ever any...?

09:54.004 --> 09:56.183
Between me and Jane?

09:56.185 --> 09:58.753
- Yeah.
- No.

09:58.755 --> 10:02.456
Was there ever any reason
for Jane to be jealous?

10:02.458 --> 10:04.125
How should I know? I...

10:04.127 --> 10:05.400
Look, they were best friends.

10:05.455 --> 10:07.595
Okay, did they have disagreements? Sure.

10:07.597 --> 10:09.530
But Kathy's not a violent person.

10:09.532 --> 10:11.556
Okay, what can you tell
me about Kathy's family?

10:11.626 --> 10:13.645
She doesn't have one. She's an orphan.

10:13.660 --> 10:15.535
- Well, she has a brother.
- Right.

10:15.605 --> 10:16.837
I'm having a hard time locating him.

10:16.839 --> 10:18.005
Do you have a contact number?

10:18.007 --> 10:20.074
I'm sorry. We never met.

10:20.076 --> 10:22.610
You've been dating for a year,
but you never met her brother?

10:22.612 --> 10:25.046
Her profile suggests
they're pretty close.

10:25.048 --> 10:26.747
They are. It just never works out.

10:26.749 --> 10:28.382
One of us is always traveling.

10:28.384 --> 10:29.517
Mm.

10:29.519 --> 10:31.185
Agent Montgomery...

10:31.187 --> 10:33.287
you have to find out who did this.

10:33.289 --> 10:35.656
If the Singapore police
think Kathy's a killer...

10:35.658 --> 10:39.694
I promise, we will get to the truth.

10:46.669 --> 10:48.869
And you're sure the
murder happened here?

10:48.871 --> 10:50.905
Arriving crews sometimes come here

10:50.907 --> 10:52.807
to retrieve their checked bags

10:52.809 --> 10:55.342
before they go out
to the general public.

10:55.344 --> 10:58.345
There are no security
cameras in this room itself,

10:58.347 --> 11:00.715
but the one outside shows Jane Wicks

11:00.717 --> 11:03.884
and Kathy Hall enter at 5:44.

11:03.923 --> 11:06.520
Two minutes later, one woman is dead

11:06.522 --> 11:08.756
and the other is fleeing the building.

11:08.758 --> 11:10.257
Signs of a struggle?

11:10.259 --> 11:13.761
As I said, we believe it was an
argument that got out of hand.

11:13.763 --> 11:15.563
Maybe.

11:15.565 --> 11:18.666
These scuff marks don't
indicate as big a struggle

11:18.668 --> 11:21.102
as I would expect from
two women of similar size.

11:21.104 --> 11:23.370
Are you questioning my conclusion?

11:23.372 --> 11:24.538
Is this your version

11:24.540 --> 11:27.141
of not interfering
with my investigation?

11:27.143 --> 11:30.678
I'm just trying to put
a picture together here.

11:30.680 --> 11:33.447
Arguments that turn lethal,
they usually do so gradually.

11:33.449 --> 11:35.282
This looks more like a blitz attack

11:35.284 --> 11:37.651
designed to catch Jane off guard.

11:37.653 --> 11:40.421
That would support the idea
that this is premeditated,

11:40.423 --> 11:42.423
not the result of an argument.

11:42.425 --> 11:46.694
Kathy Hall committed
murder, Agent Simmons.

11:46.696 --> 11:49.497
Singapore law does not differentiate

11:49.499 --> 11:51.031
based on motivation.

11:51.033 --> 11:52.466
Whatever her reason,

11:52.468 --> 11:55.136
she's gonna face the death penalty.

11:55.138 --> 11:57.905
If she did it,

11:57.907 --> 12:01.008
we will abide by the laws of the land.

12:01.010 --> 12:03.010
But if she didn't,

12:03.012 --> 12:06.080
it's my job to make sure
she gets a fighting chance.

12:10.653 --> 12:12.720
As you can see, most of the damage

12:12.759 --> 12:14.455
to the body is superficial,

12:14.461 --> 12:16.991
caused, we believe, by the machinery

12:16.993 --> 12:19.260
and collision with the other baggage.

12:19.262 --> 12:21.529
Ugh, brutal.

12:21.531 --> 12:24.899
The actual cause of death
is thought to be asphyxia.

12:24.901 --> 12:29.136
There's bruising around
the neck, broken hyoid.

12:29.138 --> 12:31.772
It's definitely strangulation.

12:35.912 --> 12:37.411
Huh.

12:47.557 --> 12:49.523
Looks like she may have
been choked from behind

12:49.525 --> 12:51.125
using this scarf from the uniform.

12:51.127 --> 12:54.061
And the defensive wounds
on her arms and her hands.

12:54.063 --> 12:56.831
She definitely struggled
against her attacker.

12:56.833 --> 12:58.432
There's flesh under her fingernails.

12:58.434 --> 12:59.400
Well, Jane's bio did say

12:59.402 --> 13:00.835
that she grew up with three brothers

13:00.837 --> 13:02.169
and played high-school soccer,

13:02.171 --> 13:03.571
so she may have been little more

13:03.573 --> 13:06.807
than our attacker was expecting.

13:10.479 --> 13:13.013
I already sent a sample to the lab.

13:13.015 --> 13:15.516
Once the results come
back with Kathy Hall's DNA,

13:15.518 --> 13:17.618
we'll have enough evidence to convict.

13:17.620 --> 13:18.953
Okay.

13:18.955 --> 13:21.255
Can you hand me the A.L.S.?

13:21.257 --> 13:22.690
Really?

13:22.692 --> 13:24.024
This is open and shut.

13:24.026 --> 13:27.194
Well, it never hurts to be thorough.

13:42.511 --> 13:45.012
Hello, lightshow.

13:47.149 --> 13:49.350
The adhesive residue
on Jane's upper thigh

13:49.352 --> 13:51.752
is the kind of thing we
see in smuggling cases.

13:51.754 --> 13:53.687
The couriers will take the contraband

13:53.689 --> 13:55.055
to places screeners won't look

13:55.057 --> 13:57.291
and then move it
undetected through customs.

13:57.293 --> 13:59.159
So, you're thinking this
whole thing's about drugs.

13:59.161 --> 14:00.594
Based on the adhesive,

14:00.596 --> 14:03.731
I'd say that we're looking
at quarter kilo, max.

14:03.733 --> 14:05.065
Well, it'd have to be pretty high value

14:05.067 --> 14:06.500
to be moving such a small amount.

14:06.502 --> 14:07.902
I'd say probably cocaine or heroin.

14:07.904 --> 14:09.737
In a place where drugs are illegal,

14:09.739 --> 14:12.006
even a small amount's
gonna get you a fortune.

14:12.008 --> 14:15.109
Monty, any indication on
whether Kathy was in on it?

14:15.111 --> 14:17.711
I think it may have been
a four-person operation.

14:17.713 --> 14:20.147
I did some digging into
Jane's cloud-storage accounts,

14:20.149 --> 14:22.783
and it turns out, Scott has met Will,

14:22.785 --> 14:24.251
which means he was lying to me.

14:24.253 --> 14:25.953
And possibly involved.

14:25.955 --> 14:27.403
With Scott's international connections

14:27.427 --> 14:29.156
and Will's previous history,

14:29.158 --> 14:30.457
you think they got enterprising?

14:30.459 --> 14:32.493
I think if Kathy decided
to double-cross the other,

14:32.495 --> 14:34.328
it could explain why
Scott was so interested

14:34.330 --> 14:35.996
in whether or not we had located her.

14:35.998 --> 14:39.700
Singapore has gone through
great lengths to eliminate drugs.

14:39.702 --> 14:42.836
That these people could bring
such a blight to this island...

14:42.838 --> 14:45.072
If this is a broken drug ring,

14:45.074 --> 14:46.507
this isn't a crime of passion.

14:46.509 --> 14:47.541
It's one of greed.

14:47.543 --> 14:49.376
The brother may be in on it, too.

14:49.378 --> 14:50.844
I still can't find him.

14:50.846 --> 14:53.180
It's like 72 hours ago,
he just fell off the map...

14:53.211 --> 14:56.417
No ATM, no cellphone,
no social media use.

14:56.419 --> 14:57.885
It's the kind of thing you expect

14:57.887 --> 14:59.320
from someone going off the grid.

14:59.322 --> 15:01.755
Jack, do you want me to take
the boyfriend into custody?

15:01.757 --> 15:03.271
Let's not tip our hand just yet.

15:03.295 --> 15:04.365
Don't let him go far.

15:04.396 --> 15:06.660
Let's focus on the killer at hand.

15:06.662 --> 15:08.862
The nature and timing of Jane's murder

15:08.864 --> 15:10.735
means we're dealing
with a highly-structured

15:10.821 --> 15:12.219
objective-driven killer.

15:12.337 --> 15:14.170
If Kathy is smuggling,
then her goal is probably

15:14.172 --> 15:15.771
to make a delivery
somewhere in the city.

15:15.773 --> 15:18.241
And she would be very dangerous.

15:45.644 --> 15:49.245
Kathy didn't kill her.
Something's not adding up.

15:54.453 --> 15:56.786
She was in a hurry.

16:00.984 --> 16:02.503
What do you make of this?

16:02.558 --> 16:04.222
Quick alterations.

16:08.800 --> 16:11.091
Looks like Kathy was
doing whatever she could

16:11.146 --> 16:13.303
to change her appearance.

16:13.305 --> 16:14.568
She planned for Jane's murder,

16:14.638 --> 16:17.040
but not for a change of clothes?

16:19.713 --> 16:21.212
Thanks.

16:24.549 --> 16:26.141
How's the witness?

16:26.306 --> 16:29.007
Well, not much help. She
dropped her bag and ran.

16:29.009 --> 16:30.809
Yeah, looks more like a costume change

16:30.811 --> 16:31.910
than an attempted murder.

16:31.912 --> 16:33.812
Which is good, but still doesn't explain

16:33.814 --> 16:36.081
why Kathy would kill her
best friend in cold blood

16:36.083 --> 16:38.450
and then leave a witness
here that can identify her.

16:38.452 --> 16:39.618
Why even come here anyway?

16:39.620 --> 16:41.586
For a woman who's trying
to avoid detection,

16:41.588 --> 16:43.288
it seems like an awfully public area.

16:43.290 --> 16:46.258
It has to be on the way to her delivery.

16:46.260 --> 16:48.326
Kathy started here at the airport,

16:48.328 --> 16:50.161
then made her way to
your present location...

16:50.163 --> 16:51.529
A distance of about 11 miles.

16:51.531 --> 16:53.365
Given direction and time of travel,

16:53.367 --> 16:55.166
that would indicate she's on foot.

16:55.168 --> 16:58.169
If we overlay the criminal
activity of the last 12 months

16:58.171 --> 16:59.604
along with local drug busts,

16:59.606 --> 17:02.140
we may get an idea
of where she's headed.

17:03.076 --> 17:04.376
Geylang.

17:04.377 --> 17:05.877
You know it?

17:05.878 --> 17:08.946
Yeah, it's the dark side of paradise.

17:11.218 --> 17:13.818
Officially, it's known
as the red-light district,

17:13.819 --> 17:15.020
but more accurately,

17:15.021 --> 17:17.689
it's an overcrowded slum
with a thriving underworld.

17:17.691 --> 17:20.425
In a country as affluent
and educated as Singapore,

17:20.426 --> 17:23.228
employers have a hard time
finding unskilled workers

17:23.230 --> 17:24.396
to do manual labor,

17:24.397 --> 17:26.431
so they get migrant
workers from other countries

17:26.433 --> 17:27.866
to come do the menial jobs.

17:27.867 --> 17:30.468
But then that leaves
the Ministry of Manpower

17:30.470 --> 17:31.703
with nowhere to put them,

17:31.705 --> 17:33.505
so a lot of times, as a result,

17:33.507 --> 17:36.007
they end up in government
dormitories in Geylang.

17:36.009 --> 17:38.076
The Ministry of Manpower? Seriously?

17:38.078 --> 17:39.945
That sounds Orwellian.

17:39.947 --> 17:43.081
Yeah, well, it is the very
embodiment of income inequality.

17:43.083 --> 17:45.016
There's a lot of poverty,
human trafficking...

17:45.018 --> 17:46.384
Just a lot of crime.

17:46.386 --> 17:50.355
Kathy had drugs to deliver.
That might be the place.

18:09.776 --> 18:10.809
What have you got, Mae?

18:10.811 --> 18:12.344
So, Monty sent me over some of

18:12.346 --> 18:14.679
Kathy and Will's old
foster-home records.

18:14.681 --> 18:15.714
I'm looking at these,

18:15.716 --> 18:17.282
and I'm having trouble finding anything

18:17.284 --> 18:18.416
that would lead me to believe

18:18.418 --> 18:20.018
that they would become drug runners.

18:20.020 --> 18:22.754
Well, people smuggle
drugs for a lot of reasons.

18:22.756 --> 18:24.923
Yes, but it almost always stems

18:24.925 --> 18:27.926
from addiction or financial instability,

18:27.928 --> 18:30.228
and their bank statements are telling us

18:30.230 --> 18:32.664
that neither of these is the case.

18:34.167 --> 18:37.102
I mean, Kathy dropped out of
high school her senior year

18:37.104 --> 18:38.970
to become Will's legal guardian.

18:38.972 --> 18:40.572
She got her associate's degree

18:40.574 --> 18:42.340
while working to help support them.

18:42.342 --> 18:44.275
I mean, Jack, she had every opportunity

18:44.277 --> 18:46.511
to get involved in the
drug trade growing up,

18:46.513 --> 18:49.114
but it seems like she spent
her entire life avoiding it.

18:49.116 --> 18:50.782
What about the brother's meth bust?

18:50.784 --> 18:52.584
So, I talked to the arresting officer,

18:52.586 --> 18:54.686
and apparently, Will was volunteering

18:54.688 --> 18:56.588
at a rehab clinic at the time.

18:56.590 --> 18:58.623
So it sounds like he took
the fall for a patient

18:58.625 --> 19:00.392
so the guy didn't get his third strike.

19:00.394 --> 19:02.060
I mean, Jack, people like this

19:02.062 --> 19:04.362
don't run drugs unless
they're being coerced.

19:04.364 --> 19:06.264
Well, if you're right, maybe the reason.

19:06.266 --> 19:07.999
Monty can't find Will isn't because

19:08.001 --> 19:10.602
he has a three-day head start,
maybe he's been abducted.

19:10.604 --> 19:12.170
He'd be pretty good leverage.

19:12.172 --> 19:14.506
I mean, he was important to both women.

19:14.508 --> 19:17.776
Jack, I think that we have
to consider the possibility

19:17.778 --> 19:20.612
that Kathy and Jane are
not willing participants

19:20.614 --> 19:22.213
in this smuggling operation.

19:22.215 --> 19:23.248
Call Monty.

19:23.250 --> 19:25.150
See if he still has the boyfriend.

19:25.152 --> 19:26.951
He's gonna have to tell some lies.

19:26.953 --> 19:27.986
Yeah.

19:38.031 --> 19:39.197
Did you find her?

19:39.199 --> 19:40.265
We're getting closer.

19:40.267 --> 19:42.434
She attacked a woman
in an alley downtown.

19:42.436 --> 19:45.103
Attacked? There's no way.

19:45.105 --> 19:46.604
Yeah, local police are saying

19:46.606 --> 19:48.373
it's a miracle the woman is even alive.

19:48.375 --> 19:50.476
You know of anything
that may have triggered

19:50.515 --> 19:51.444
this kind of violence

19:51.522 --> 19:54.145
or any unusual stress
she's experiencing?

19:54.960 --> 19:56.581
Stress.

19:56.583 --> 19:58.183
Uh...

19:58.185 --> 20:00.351
No.

20:01.855 --> 20:05.156
Our profilers believe
that whatever caused Kathy

20:05.158 --> 20:07.358
to kill Jane has activated
some kind of blood lust.

20:07.360 --> 20:08.793
They think she may try to kill again.

20:08.795 --> 20:12.897
Y-You think Kathy's
on a murderous rampage?

20:12.899 --> 20:15.700
It's not the clinical term, but yeah.

20:15.702 --> 20:17.936
Where was the attack?

20:17.938 --> 20:20.405
We've tracked her to the Geylang slums.

20:20.407 --> 20:22.474
My team is worried that she's
looking for another victim.

20:22.476 --> 20:26.144
Do you know anyone Kathy
would try to target in Geylang?

20:26.146 --> 20:29.447
Honestly, Agent Montgomery, I don't.

20:31.785 --> 20:34.018
- Go.
- Well, you were right Jack.

20:34.020 --> 20:36.020
Scott's definitely behind this.

20:36.022 --> 20:37.755
Not 30 seconds after I left the room,

20:37.757 --> 20:39.457
he put an encrypted call to Singapore.

20:39.459 --> 20:41.626
Thanks to the Foreign
Intelligence and Surveillance Act,

20:41.628 --> 20:43.194
I didn't even need a
warrant to trace it.

20:43.196 --> 20:46.531
The call went in to a
man named Han Bo Sheng.

20:46.533 --> 20:49.367
I'm sending you the location now.

21:01.781 --> 21:03.515
Hello?

21:10.557 --> 21:12.423
Hello?

21:14.528 --> 21:16.995
I'm looking for Han.

21:22.169 --> 21:23.635
Han?

21:29.276 --> 21:30.642
Han?

21:37.384 --> 21:40.218
Oh, my God.

21:40.220 --> 21:41.586
Oh my God!

21:43.056 --> 21:44.595
Aah!

21:46.526 --> 21:47.825
Two murders in one day

21:47.827 --> 21:50.328
and you wonder why
our laws are so harsh.

21:50.330 --> 21:53.331
That's to prevent a situation like this.

21:56.102 --> 21:57.468
Kathy was definitely here.

21:57.470 --> 22:00.471
Matches the pair that she stole
from the woman at the plaza.

22:02.342 --> 22:05.610
Let me guess... Han Boshane.

22:05.612 --> 22:07.961
Agent Garrett, do you mind

22:07.985 --> 22:10.114
telling me how you knew
for us to come here?

22:10.116 --> 22:13.551
We found the man in the States
who's forcing Kathy to do this.

22:13.553 --> 22:15.453
Well, if Jane and Kathy
were both being coerced,

22:15.455 --> 22:16.621
then why did Jane end up dead?

22:16.623 --> 22:18.489
Maybe she got cold feet.

22:18.491 --> 22:20.525
I mean, I can't even
imagine having to choose

22:20.527 --> 22:22.263
between my best friend's
life and my brother's.

22:22.334 --> 22:24.920
But even so, why kill Han?

22:26.107 --> 22:27.498
Maybe she didn't.

22:27.500 --> 22:30.902
These are the test results
from Jane's autopsy.

22:30.904 --> 22:32.203
The blood from her blouse

22:32.205 --> 22:34.439
and the scrapings under her fingernails

22:34.441 --> 22:36.741
contained two different
sets of male DNA.

22:36.743 --> 22:40.278
So, either Jane and
Kathy were both men...

22:40.280 --> 22:42.680
Or there were other people in
the luggage room that night.

22:42.682 --> 22:44.916
That's why there wasn't
more of a struggle.

22:44.918 --> 22:46.784
This wasn't a blitz attack by Kathy.

22:46.786 --> 22:48.742
Both she and Jane were ambushed.

22:48.805 --> 22:50.852
The attackers could have laid in wait

22:50.906 --> 22:53.157
knowing that both women were coming.

22:53.159 --> 22:54.692
When they entered,

22:54.694 --> 22:57.261
the men would have cornered
them almost immediately.

22:58.465 --> 23:00.398
The one grabs Jane...

23:00.400 --> 23:02.033
Who fights back.

23:03.970 --> 23:06.938
Post-911, all flight crews were
trained to fight off hijackers

23:06.940 --> 23:08.272
using the tools of hands,

23:08.274 --> 23:10.408
so, while Jane wrestles with one...

23:11.878 --> 23:14.679
... Kathy uses her luggage
to fend off the other.

23:16.483 --> 23:17.849
And she gets away,

23:17.851 --> 23:19.317
but she can't go to the
police because the drugs,

23:19.319 --> 23:21.753
so she disappears into the night.

23:22.722 --> 23:24.722
Interesting theory, but one problem...

23:24.724 --> 23:26.457
The camera outside the luggage room

23:26.459 --> 23:28.126
clearly showed the room was empty

23:28.128 --> 23:29.961
eight minutes before the attack.

23:29.963 --> 23:32.130
There's only one way
in and out of that room.

23:32.132 --> 23:33.264
Mm. That's not true.

23:33.266 --> 23:37.068
Jane's body didn't go out the door.

23:37.070 --> 23:39.704
She went out on the conveyor.

23:39.706 --> 23:42.974
The attackers could have come
in and gone out the same way.

23:45.725 --> 23:49.881
_

23:50.884 --> 23:53.384
So Kathy didn't kill Jane.

23:53.386 --> 23:55.753
Scott forced them both
into smuggling drugs,

23:55.755 --> 23:56.821
and they got robbed.

23:56.823 --> 23:58.856
Probably by one of his rivals

23:58.858 --> 24:00.658
that wasn't happy with the competition.

24:00.660 --> 24:03.361
Well, it may not matter.
According to Singapore law,

24:03.363 --> 24:05.897
drug trafficking is still
considered a capital crime.

24:05.899 --> 24:08.900
You don't have to be guilty of
murder to face a death penalty.

24:08.902 --> 24:13.404
So we assume Kathy came
here to make her delivery.

24:13.406 --> 24:15.239
It's the only hope she would have had

24:15.241 --> 24:16.153
to get her brother back.

24:16.192 --> 24:17.742
But the unsub got here first,

24:17.744 --> 24:19.076
so, when Kathy got here,

24:19.078 --> 24:20.889
instead of finding Han, she got grabbed.

24:20.928 --> 24:23.581
Yeah, but why? There's
already two dead bodies.

24:23.583 --> 24:25.514
Why keep Kathy alive?

24:26.052 --> 24:28.252
Because she grew up
watching the drug trade.

24:28.254 --> 24:30.521
She knows how it works.

24:30.523 --> 24:31.330
I mean, after the airport,

24:31.369 --> 24:33.587
Kathy knew that she was no
good as a courier anymore.

24:33.702 --> 24:36.169
And if Han was the only
contact she had on the island,

24:36.171 --> 24:38.137
he's the only one who
can help her escape.

24:38.139 --> 24:40.840
But once she makes that
delivery, she's useless to them.

24:40.842 --> 24:42.041
And he'd cut her loose.

24:42.043 --> 24:44.811
So she hid the drugs
to get what she wanted.

24:44.813 --> 24:46.813
And by the time she got
here, Han was already dead.

24:46.815 --> 24:49.282
And now her only hope
is that whoever took her

24:49.284 --> 24:52.752
wants the drugs enough
to keep her alive.

25:00.595 --> 25:03.796
Tell us where it is.

25:05.400 --> 25:07.066
Hey.

25:08.158 --> 25:11.150
_

25:18.847 --> 25:21.180
So you're kind of like
Tom Sawyer, aren't you?

25:21.182 --> 25:22.549
Excuse me?

25:22.551 --> 25:24.517
Friendly kid that got a bunch
of friends to paint his fence.

25:24.519 --> 25:26.024
You should really read it.

25:26.157 --> 25:31.357
See, at first, I thought
you, Jane, Will, and Kathy

25:31.359 --> 25:32.625
were all in this together

25:32.627 --> 25:35.061
like one big, happy,
drug-smuggling family.

25:35.063 --> 25:37.196
Drugs? No, no, Agent
Montgomery, I deal art.

25:37.198 --> 25:38.731
But then, after last time we spoke

25:38.733 --> 25:40.199
and you put in that call to Han,

25:40.201 --> 25:44.137
I realized you are more
of the puppet master.

25:45.640 --> 25:48.708
He's dead, by the way. Han.

25:48.710 --> 25:52.545
I have no idea what
you're talking about,

25:52.547 --> 25:56.316
but I think I might want
to speak to my lawyer.

25:56.318 --> 25:59.385
That call to Han was everything
I needed to get a warrant

25:59.387 --> 26:02.088
from a federal judge for
your business dealings.

26:02.090 --> 26:03.456
And while you're squeaky clean,

26:03.458 --> 26:04.857
a lot of the people on your staff

26:04.859 --> 26:06.259
have extensive criminal records.

26:06.261 --> 26:09.596
Which brings me back to
my point about Tom Sawyer.

26:09.598 --> 26:11.931
You're the kind of guy
who gets other people

26:11.933 --> 26:13.232
to do his dirty work.

26:14.569 --> 26:17.837
I don't have to take this anymore.

26:17.839 --> 26:19.505
I'm leaving.

26:19.507 --> 26:21.808
I doubt that.

26:21.810 --> 26:24.510
Not for a long time.

26:27.549 --> 26:29.148
So tell me,

26:29.150 --> 26:30.883
did you immediately know Jane and Kathy

26:30.885 --> 26:32.018
would make good couriers,

26:32.020 --> 26:34.120
or did it take a little
while to figure it out?

26:34.889 --> 26:37.223
Because as flight attendants,

26:37.225 --> 26:38.358
they wouldn't be subjected

26:38.360 --> 26:40.426
to the same scrutiny
as other passengers.

26:40.428 --> 26:42.629
So you groomed them.

26:42.631 --> 26:45.398
Dated one, befriended the other.

26:45.400 --> 26:48.501
It's a real long con, wasn't it?

26:48.503 --> 26:51.270
But a charismatic guy like you

26:51.272 --> 26:53.973
isn't really used to
women telling him no.

26:53.975 --> 26:58.111
It's why it surprised you
when they turned you down.

26:58.113 --> 27:00.847
You didn't ask them nice
the second time, did you?

27:00.849 --> 27:02.882
- This is preposterous.
- Is it?

27:02.884 --> 27:04.984
Yeah.

27:06.588 --> 27:10.990
You told me that you had never met Will.

27:13.461 --> 27:16.562
But you had.

27:16.564 --> 27:19.198
And I have proof.

27:19.200 --> 27:23.903
See, you knew that he was
important to both of them.

27:23.905 --> 27:25.538
So you threatened to hurt him

27:25.540 --> 27:27.674
to get them to smuggle drugs for you.

27:27.676 --> 27:29.809
You can't prove any of this.

27:29.811 --> 27:32.311
I couldn't, but then I realized

27:32.313 --> 27:35.982
that your company leases a storage unit

27:35.984 --> 27:37.383
in east Baltimore.

27:37.385 --> 27:38.418
And as an art dealer,

27:38.420 --> 27:39.986
I understand all the
museum-quality storage

27:39.988 --> 27:40.920
that you have to rent,

27:40.922 --> 27:42.955
but I couldn't for the life of me

27:42.957 --> 27:45.925
understand why you would
want some rat-infested garage

27:45.927 --> 27:48.327
deep in the heart of the city.

27:48.329 --> 27:50.329
So I had a few agents check it out.

28:02.343 --> 28:07.580
And that is when I realized...

28:07.582 --> 28:09.949
you're not Tom Sawyer.

28:11.720 --> 28:14.687
He never had to kidnap
anybody to get what he wanted.

28:16.424 --> 28:18.791
You already got Han and Jane killed.

28:18.793 --> 28:22.962
Whoever you pissed off has taken Kathy.

28:22.964 --> 28:25.364
Does that not mean anything to you?

28:28.036 --> 28:31.738
Who are they and where
have they taken her?

28:34.242 --> 28:36.242
Lawyer.

28:38.012 --> 28:41.547
Scott Davis, I'm gonna
need you to turn around

28:41.549 --> 28:43.583
and put your hands behind your back.

28:43.585 --> 28:46.519
You're under arrest for the
kidnapping of William Hall.

28:55.497 --> 28:57.897
This place is a stronghold.

28:57.899 --> 28:59.866
We've looked everywhere.

28:59.868 --> 29:03.269
This is a drug operation,
then where are the drugs?

29:03.271 --> 29:05.571
I don't know, maybe
this is just a way point

29:05.573 --> 29:07.073
for Kathy to deliver the drugs

29:07.075 --> 29:08.808
and they're shipped someplace else.

29:08.810 --> 29:10.743
Yeah, but in a country

29:10.745 --> 29:12.445
where possession is punishable by death,

29:12.447 --> 29:13.880
you'd want to limit your exposure

29:13.882 --> 29:15.982
to the fewest number
of locations possible.

29:17.051 --> 29:19.118
There's not even trace
evidence of narcotics here.

29:19.120 --> 29:20.987
If this were part of a larger operation,

29:20.989 --> 29:23.589
you'd think we'd at least find
cutting agents or packaging.

29:23.591 --> 29:26.292
Unless they were
smuggling something else.

29:28.763 --> 29:30.363
Check this out.

29:31.332 --> 29:35.067
These tanks, they're
not for processing drugs,

29:35.069 --> 29:36.903
they're for breeding.

29:36.905 --> 29:39.906
Jane and Kathy, they
weren't smuggling drugs,

29:39.908 --> 29:43.009
they were smuggling fish.

29:44.519 --> 29:47.589
The Asian arowana, or dragon fish,

29:47.661 --> 29:49.161
is an endangered species,

29:49.163 --> 29:50.796
prized across South-East Asia

29:50.798 --> 29:52.725
for its rarity and brilliance in color.

29:52.756 --> 29:56.326
It's also been on the
IUCN Red List since 1996.

29:56.389 --> 29:57.709
According to this, the arowana

29:57.781 --> 29:59.492
is one of only eight fish species

29:59.523 --> 30:02.430
on the most-restricted list for
international trade treaties.

30:02.602 --> 30:05.669
Wait, so smugglers just stuff a
three-foot fish in their pants?

30:05.671 --> 30:08.672
Uh, apparently, they smuggle fingerlings

30:08.674 --> 30:09.886
that are just under 1 1/2 inches long

30:09.956 --> 30:11.753
and then keep them
alive for up to 36 hours

30:11.808 --> 30:12.987
under the right conditions.

30:13.097 --> 30:14.394
Yeah, they've sold for hundreds

30:14.464 --> 30:16.034
of thousands of dollars
on the black market.

30:16.105 --> 30:18.200
Then Scott and Han were
stepping on the toes

30:18.202 --> 30:21.737
of some very wealthy people
who run the black market.

30:21.739 --> 30:24.540
You know who's behind this?

30:24.542 --> 30:26.475
- Al Gui.
- A ghost?

30:26.477 --> 30:29.178
Taiwan has stories of a
wealthy dealer in the city

30:29.180 --> 30:31.047
who trades in endangered species.

30:31.049 --> 30:34.283
We have conducted
multiple investigations.

30:34.285 --> 30:36.279
But thus far, Singapore PD

30:36.341 --> 30:38.954
have been unable to even
prove that he exists.

30:38.956 --> 30:41.757
Singapore PD doesn't have Monty.

30:41.759 --> 30:44.627
The stories of Gui tells of evil,

30:44.629 --> 30:47.863
a soulless man who delights in
pain and suffering of others.

30:47.865 --> 30:51.033
If he has Ms. Hall, it might be bad.

30:51.035 --> 30:53.869
Well, welcome aboard.

31:30.380 --> 31:32.439
Monty, where are we on that location?

31:32.544 --> 31:34.744
I gotta give it to your
guy at Singapore PD.

31:34.746 --> 31:37.146
One phone call and he
got me the entire database

31:37.148 --> 31:38.915
of cellphone ESNs registered

31:38.917 --> 31:40.650
near the airport on
the night of the murder.

31:40.652 --> 31:42.285
That's gotta be thousands.

31:42.287 --> 31:45.121
I'm pulling the last 90
minutes of registry information

31:45.123 --> 31:47.190
from the repeaters near Han's shop.

31:47.192 --> 31:49.292
Finding an intersection and data.

31:52.363 --> 31:55.298
Jack, there appears to
only be one cellphone

31:55.300 --> 31:57.400
that was active at the
airport the night of the murder

31:57.402 --> 32:00.536
that was also active
near Han's shop tonight.

32:00.615 --> 32:01.614
Where is it now?

32:01.616 --> 32:04.149
I'm sending you the coordinates.

32:09.257 --> 32:12.291
Please allow me to apologize.

32:12.293 --> 32:15.327
You know, sometimes I forget
that these trained monkeys

32:15.329 --> 32:17.997
who work for me take
things a little too far.

32:17.999 --> 32:19.598
Please, let me go.

32:23.471 --> 32:25.671
Of course.

32:25.673 --> 32:27.172
I'm a businessman.

32:27.174 --> 32:28.874
I'm not here to hurt you.

32:30.945 --> 32:33.279
You killed Jane.

32:34.849 --> 32:37.816
Jane was an unfortunate accident.

32:37.818 --> 32:40.886
And for that, I am deeply sorry.

32:40.888 --> 32:46.158
You know, those were
not the instructions.

32:53.234 --> 32:55.167
All I want is the fish.

33:01.142 --> 33:04.209
No one else needs to get hurt.

33:07.582 --> 33:09.748
Ouch.

33:20.361 --> 33:21.994
This is gonna be on us.

33:21.996 --> 33:24.430
We bring in the cavalry,
they'll see us coming.

33:24.432 --> 33:27.032
All units, this is SSI Joe.

33:27.034 --> 33:29.468
Keep a six-block distance and no sirens.

33:29.470 --> 33:32.037
I repeat... no sirens.

33:32.039 --> 33:34.106
I mean, that's a thousand units, easy.

33:34.108 --> 33:36.208
This is gonna be a needle in a haystack.

33:36.210 --> 33:38.644
Yeah, Monty, we're gonna need
to narrow the search a little.

33:38.646 --> 33:41.680
A cell is currently pinging
off a femptocell on the roof.

33:41.682 --> 33:43.782
So it's gotta be somewhere
on the top few floors.

33:43.784 --> 33:46.218
Clara, Mae, we're
gonna need eyes on him.

33:46.220 --> 33:47.519
Got it.

33:47.521 --> 33:51.023
Please, tell me where
the dragon fish is,

33:51.025 --> 33:53.158
and this could all be over.

33:53.160 --> 33:54.627
I can't.

33:54.629 --> 33:57.529
They have my brother. They'll kill him.

34:01.035 --> 34:03.268
Who's they?

34:03.270 --> 34:05.671
Scott and Han?

34:05.673 --> 34:09.375
They never should've
brought you into this.

34:09.377 --> 34:10.842
Please.

34:10.844 --> 34:12.945
I had no choice.

34:16.150 --> 34:20.085
Look, I'm not gonna tell you
that I'm a good man, Kathy,

34:20.087 --> 34:22.655
but I am an honorable one.

34:23.972 --> 34:26.081
You have my word.

34:27.328 --> 34:29.594
Tell me where the fish is,

34:29.597 --> 34:32.965
and I will do everything in my power

34:32.967 --> 34:35.768
to help get your brother back.

34:35.770 --> 34:37.770
Think about it.

34:41.242 --> 34:44.443
And what choice do you really have?

34:50.818 --> 34:53.003
Okay.

34:53.821 --> 34:55.853
I'll tell you.

34:58.526 --> 35:00.459
Monty, what do you got?

35:00.461 --> 35:02.795
There is a penthouse on 58

35:02.797 --> 35:04.525
that just had permits pulled last week

35:04.666 --> 35:06.498
for a 2,000-gallon aquarium.

35:06.500 --> 35:08.333
I never thought I would say this but,

35:08.335 --> 35:11.270
thank God for overly burdensome
government regulation.

35:14.475 --> 35:18.310
Okay, Jack, 58 101. I've
got visual confirmation

35:18.312 --> 35:19.978
of three men and one hostage.

35:19.980 --> 35:22.181
Copy. We're close.

35:23.451 --> 35:25.584
Would you like to do the honors?

35:25.586 --> 35:26.685
Monty.

35:28.122 --> 35:29.888
I'm on standby, Jack.

35:31.926 --> 35:34.193
See, now was that so hard?

35:38.733 --> 35:40.065
Kill her.

35:40.067 --> 35:41.967
What?

35:41.969 --> 35:44.336
What... No, but you... you promised.

35:44.338 --> 35:47.339
Yes, and for that,
again I must apologize.

35:47.341 --> 35:51.710
But there's a price for
doing business on my island.

35:52.947 --> 35:55.180
No.

36:00.521 --> 36:03.222
- Jack, you gotta go now.
- Monty, make the call.

36:09.163 --> 36:11.430
- Hello?
- Knock, knock.

36:13.400 --> 36:14.733
FBI!

36:18.672 --> 36:21.006
On the ground!

36:22.877 --> 36:25.410
On the floor, now!

36:33.888 --> 36:35.754
- You okay?
- Yeah.

36:53.607 --> 36:56.308
Thank you. I don't even know how to...

36:56.310 --> 36:59.144
No. Don't thank me yet.
This isn't over, okay?

36:59.146 --> 37:00.946
You're gonna have to
go with these officers.

37:00.948 --> 37:03.715
We are gonna help you.

37:03.717 --> 37:05.684
Do not speak to anyone
until you are contacted

37:05.686 --> 37:07.452
by someone from the State Department.

37:11.992 --> 37:13.325
Thank you.

37:13.327 --> 37:16.528
I don't know if I could've
handled the situation myself.

37:16.530 --> 37:18.831
Well, the IRT is always happy to help.

37:18.833 --> 37:22.267
Thank you for allowing
us to find the truth.

37:22.269 --> 37:25.771
Kathy wasn't the killer, and
we found the men who were.

37:25.773 --> 37:28.473
Whatever the differences
our countries may have,

37:28.475 --> 37:31.577
please know that we all desire justice.

37:31.579 --> 37:33.312
Of that I'm sure.

37:33.314 --> 37:35.514
Whatever laws she may have broken,

37:35.516 --> 37:37.683
she only did so because someone

37:37.685 --> 37:40.185
who was threatening to kill her brother.

37:40.187 --> 37:43.856
But these are serious crimes...
Smuggling, avoiding arrest.

37:43.858 --> 37:46.725
Illegal operation of a fire door.

37:47.995 --> 37:50.662
There are mitigating circumstances.

37:50.664 --> 37:53.131
You could recommend to your superiors

37:53.133 --> 37:56.301
that she return home to
the United States with us.

37:58.005 --> 38:00.339
I'll see what I can do.

38:13.954 --> 38:16.421
I can't believe she
had the presence of mind

38:16.423 --> 38:17.589
to hide the fish.

38:18.993 --> 38:22.027
Right here in plain sight.

38:25.165 --> 38:29.201
Can you imagine paying a
million dollars for a fish?

38:29.203 --> 38:30.335
So what do you guys say

38:30.337 --> 38:32.471
we pick up some sushi for the ride home?

38:32.473 --> 38:34.539
- Too soon?
- Ew.

38:34.541 --> 38:36.642
- Too soon?
- That's gross.

38:44.585 --> 38:46.285
If I only knew the
Singaporean government

38:46.287 --> 38:48.487
would show a little mercy out
of respect for the IRT, huh?

38:48.489 --> 38:52.224
- Please tell me you're okay.
- I think so.

38:52.226 --> 38:53.992
Thanks to these people.

38:53.994 --> 38:55.928
When will you be home?

38:55.930 --> 38:57.562
Tomorrow.

38:59.066 --> 39:00.365
I can't believe the Singapore government

39:00.367 --> 39:01.934
made her promise never
to return to the island.

39:01.936 --> 39:03.135
I know, poor thing.

39:03.137 --> 39:05.037
She loses her best
friend and her dream job,

39:05.039 --> 39:06.738
all in the same day.

39:06.740 --> 39:10.042
So much for happily ever after, huh?

39:10.044 --> 39:11.043
Nah.

39:11.045 --> 39:13.011
She's a fighter.

39:13.013 --> 39:15.480
Everything she's been
through in her past,

39:15.482 --> 39:17.683
I have a feeling she's gonna be okay.

39:26.961 --> 39:30.295
Okay, everyone, let's go home.
