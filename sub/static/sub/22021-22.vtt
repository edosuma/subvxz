00:01.000 --> 00:02.708
[Tom] Previously on Designated Survivor...

00:02.836 --> 00:05.874
Chelsea, 842 Hammersmith Lane,
Apartment 6B.

00:06.006 --> 00:07.963
That's the address of my daughter,
Amy, in London.

00:08.090 --> 00:10.753
<i>'Cause if I'm dead, Valeria will come for her
to close the loop.</i>

00:10.886 --> 00:12.627
Please protect my daughter.

00:12.763 --> 00:14.470
[Cornelius] Going after
both political parties?

00:14.598 --> 00:15.884
A former president?

00:16.015 --> 00:18.132
If you really think that's what's best
for this country,

00:18.268 --> 00:21.056
-you shouldn't be sitting in that chair.
-But I am.

00:21.188 --> 00:24.852
You deployed Hannah Wells to find dirt
on a man you knew was a political opponent.

00:24.983 --> 00:26.974
She conducted warrantless searches,
unlawful surveillance.

00:27.110 --> 00:28.271
Where is this going?

00:28.403 --> 00:30.940
| have probable cause to believe
you were part of a criminal conspiracy.

00:31.073 --> 00:36.159
Today, I am proud to announce my candidacy
for president of this great nation.

00:36.286 --> 00:38.698
Last place I wanna go tonight is my home.

00:38.830 --> 00:40.958
-So crash on my couch.
-Yeah?

00:41.083 --> 00:44.075
- I will go get your stuff.
-You need to be under 24-hour protection.

00:44.211 --> 00:45.872
-You can't go home.
-Emily.

00:46.004 --> 00:47.460
[cell phone ringing]

00:48.340 --> 00:49.455
[gun fires]

00:50.050 --> 00:50.960
Emily!

01:04.815 --> 01:06.146
[Tom] Thank God you're okay.

01:06.275 --> 01:09.358
Uh, I'm fine, Mr. President.
You didn't have to come.

01:09.486 --> 01:12.444
My Chief of Staff gets shot,
I'm going to the hospital.

01:12.573 --> 01:14.314
The bullet just grazed me.
It was 13 stitches.

01:14.449 --> 01:15.575
Thirteen too many.

01:15.701 --> 01:17.612
[sighs] What happened to the shooter?

01:17.744 --> 01:19.655
Fred Archer. We took him out.

01:21.623 --> 01:23.864
-If something had happened to you--
- It didn't.

01:24.001 --> 01:26.333
-Did West bring charges against Moss?
-No.

01:26.461 --> 01:29.954
Don't worry about anything
except getting better, okay?

01:48.942 --> 01:50.023
Let's get started.

01:51.653 --> 01:53.189
Here are the charges against you

01:53.322 --> 01:55.814
that I've referred
to the Attorney General.

01:57.993 --> 02:01.611
Burglary. Witness tampering.
Obstruction of government proceedings.

02:01.747 --> 02:04.865
-The president didn't do those things.
-But Hannah Wells did.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.334
On the president's behalf,
which makes him a co-conspirator.

02:08.461 --> 02:12.956
Based on these findings, I have probable
cause to file charges against you, sir.

02:13.091 --> 02:14.673
Nothing will come of those charges.

02:14.801 --> 02:17.338
Because Wells wasn't acting
at my direction.

02:17.471 --> 02:18.711
You granted her authority.

02:18.847 --> 02:20.838
Even if you could make that dubious case,

02:20.974 --> 02:23.136
there's no model for charging
a sitting president with a crime.

02:23.268 --> 02:25.430
Which is why it's in the best interest
of the country

02:25.562 --> 02:27.678
to find a political solution
to the problem.

02:27.814 --> 02:30.681
I've asked Senators Feller
and Crowell to join me.

02:30.817 --> 02:33.935
Ray, I'll stop you right there.
I'm not resigning.

02:34.071 --> 02:38.156
No, sir. We have a proposition in mind,
one that won't plunge the country into crisis.

02:38.283 --> 02:42.151
Announce you're not standing
for reelection. Finish out your term.

02:42.287 --> 02:45.325
And Attorney General Beckett
will decline to file charges.

02:45.457 --> 02:46.788
Well, he works for me.

02:46.917 --> 02:50.535
| want to hear his explanation
for colluding with Congress.

02:50.671 --> 02:52.287
If I bring charges against you,

02:52.422 --> 02:53.833
it'll precipitate a constitutional crisis

02:53.965 --> 02:56.673
and I don't think that good for the country.

02:56.802 --> 03:00.261
Yes, but your solution clears the playing field
for my opponents.

03:00.389 --> 03:02.926
Ain't that right, senators?
So you can back the candidates you want.

03:03.058 --> 03:06.471
[Beckett] The media is going to get
a hold of this. I can't sit on it.

03:06.603 --> 03:08.765
| intend to file charges tomorrow.

03:08.897 --> 03:11.104
| need your decision by the end of the day.

03:12.025 --> 03:13.231
Understood.

03:15.445 --> 03:18.312
24 hours ago, they wanted me to run.
Now, they want me to run away.

03:18.448 --> 03:21.281
They're political animals. The Attorney
General is tougher to explain.

03:21.410 --> 03:23.572
Not to me.
The first sign of trouble, he betrays you.

03:23.704 --> 03:25.240
I'm not happy with what Ray did.

03:25.372 --> 03:28.239
But he found an imperfect solution
to a complicated problem.

03:28.375 --> 03:30.241
-The one he's offering isn't it.
-Agreed.

03:30.377 --> 03:33.665
But in the end, he's doing what he thinks is
right. I can't blame him for that.

03:33.797 --> 03:35.583
Kendra, we need another fix.

03:35.716 --> 03:38.458
I'll see if there's a way
to forestall this.

03:38.593 --> 03:41.005
You're meeting with the Fed chairman
later this morning.

03:41.138 --> 03:44.756
Then the NIH update.
Judge Putnam's memorial is this afternoon.

03:44.891 --> 03:49.010
[sighs] Send my regrets.
We've got too many fires to put out today.

03:49.146 --> 03:51.103
Including Taurasi's referendum
on independence.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.972
When do Seth and Lyor
meet with the governor?

03:53.108 --> 03:54.940
They landed in Taurasi
a couple of hours ago.

03:55.068 --> 03:57.981
They should be sitting with the governor now.
I'll get you an update.

04:04.411 --> 04:07.369
[Habalo] Lyor, you and Seth have come a long way
on behalf of your president,

04:07.497 --> 04:09.875
-and I appreciate that.
-[Lyor] I don't think you do.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.868
America's close relationship with Taurasi
goes back nearly 80 years.

04:14.004 --> 04:17.463
And we've given you airstrips,
access to our harbors.

04:17.591 --> 04:19.878
In exchange for billions in aid.
Military protection...

04:20.010 --> 04:22.297
[Habalo] And we are grateful.
But it's 2018.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.675
The Taurasi people don't want to be
a fiefdom anymore.

04:25.807 --> 04:27.718
They want economic independence,

04:27.851 --> 04:31.970
which is why they democratically voted
to sever official ties with your country.

04:32.105 --> 04:34.688
That vote is ineffective
without your signature.

04:34.816 --> 04:35.851
Why should I withhold it?

04:35.984 --> 04:38.976
Because the vote was skewed
by millions in TV ads

04:39.112 --> 04:40.648
our enemies poured into your market.

04:40.781 --> 04:43.773
Look, we get how going it alone
is enticing. We do.

04:43.909 --> 04:46.742
But ask Great Britain
how Brexit has worked out for them.

04:48.997 --> 04:51.534
If Taurasi leaves, it could be
the first domino to fall.

04:51.666 --> 04:54.078
Guam, American Samoa
and the Marianas could follow,

04:54.211 --> 04:56.703
all of which are of critical
strategic importance to the US.

04:56.838 --> 04:59.830
If we can't talk the governor down,
Kirkman's legacy could be

04:59.966 --> 05:02.458
presiding over the gradual dismantling
of the American empire.

05:02.594 --> 05:05.052
That's not what I'm worried about today.

05:05.180 --> 05:07.421
Let's close this deal,
get back to the Alamo.

05:07.557 --> 05:09.059
They need reinforcements.

05:09.726 --> 05:11.842
-Even if I don't.
-I'm not a reinforcement.

05:11.978 --> 05:14.891
| worked for the head of
the International Development Committee.

05:15.023 --> 05:16.855
-I know the region.
-Mm-hmm.

05:16.983 --> 05:18.098
We've got some time.

05:18.235 --> 05:21.603
-I'll hit a coffee shop.
-You should kick that habit like I did.

05:21.738 --> 05:24.605
Caffeine makes a person
irritable and anxious.

05:24.741 --> 05:27.403
Ow! Son of a bitch.
Is that a tsetse fly?

05:28.078 --> 05:29.239
I'll see you later.

05:34.376 --> 05:35.207
-[Aaron] Hey.
-[Kendra] Hey.

05:36.086 --> 05:40.296
Do you have any idea how the president
can fight these criminal charges?

05:40.423 --> 05:43.666
The president's best bet is to assert
executive privilege to quash the indictment.

05:43.802 --> 05:45.713
But the Attorney General would just appeal.

05:45.846 --> 05:48.634
The case would be stuck in the courts.
It'd cripple our credibility.

05:48.765 --> 05:51.473
We must convince the AG
that Hannah acted on her own.

05:51.601 --> 05:54.593
-She needs to give us an affidavit now.
-That's not gonna happen.

05:54.729 --> 05:56.720
[Kendra] Why not?
She's loyal to the president.

05:56.857 --> 05:59.440
She can attest truthfully that he never
directed her to commit a crime.

05:59.568 --> 06:00.729
She went off the grid.

06:02.529 --> 06:04.065
| can't get a hold of her.

06:24.718 --> 06:27.085
Hi, I'm looking for Amy Bleecker.

06:27.220 --> 06:28.301
Amy's not here.

06:29.222 --> 06:31.008
[sighs] Do you know where she went?

06:31.141 --> 06:34.054
We just broke for our spring hiatus.
She should be back next week.

06:34.185 --> 06:35.516
Do you have an address for her?

06:35.645 --> 06:38.637
-No. We're not close.
-What about a phone number?

06:38.773 --> 06:40.639
She doesn't have a mobile.

06:44.154 --> 06:49.615
So, a 16-year-old who goes
to a fancy school doesn't have a phone.

06:49.743 --> 06:52.360
Her roommate can't get in touch with her.

06:52.495 --> 06:55.283
And her bed looks like
it's never been slept in.

06:55.415 --> 06:59.500
| don't think Amy is gone. I think
you're Amy and you live here alone.

06:59.628 --> 07:00.493
[Hannah grunts]

07:05.592 --> 07:06.423
Hey.

07:06.551 --> 07:09.464
-Dad, I would've come to you.
-Come on, let me see it.

07:14.684 --> 07:17.062
-Georgetown.
-Yep.

07:17.938 --> 07:19.099
[laughs]

07:20.148 --> 07:22.185
Congratulations. Your first choice.

07:22.859 --> 07:25.317
[chuckles] My first choice
was any school in Hawaii,

07:25.445 --> 07:27.356
but I can learn to surf during a gap year.

07:27.489 --> 07:30.902
You go to Georgetown,
you can open up a surfing school.

07:31.034 --> 07:33.241
Let's celebrate.
Dinner wherever you want.

07:33.370 --> 07:36.408
Good. Let's take Air Force One to Italy,
get some real pizza.

07:36.539 --> 07:38.746
How about Bertelli's on Connecticut
and we shoot the moon.

07:38.875 --> 07:40.206
-Can I get a beer?
-No.

07:40.877 --> 07:43.539
But I'm really proud of you. Come here.

07:43.672 --> 07:44.662
[both chuckle]

07:44.798 --> 07:48.211
Sorry to interrupt, Leo.
Mr. President, you're needed in Command Ops.

07:52.055 --> 07:54.012
My son just got into Georgetown.

07:57.644 --> 07:58.850
[Fleming] Atten-hut!

07:58.979 --> 08:00.435
[Tom] General, what's going on?

08:00.563 --> 08:03.351
Sir, the NEIC detected
a massive 8.2 earthquake

08:03.483 --> 08:07.602
in a subduction zone, 15 miles off the coast
of Taurasi, triggering a tsunami.

08:07.737 --> 08:09.899
We didn't have enough time
to evacuate the coastline, sir.

08:10.031 --> 08:12.898
-Aaron, reach out to Seth and Lyor now.
-[Aaron] Yes, sir.

08:13.410 --> 08:14.400
[Tom] Oh, my God.

08:14.536 --> 08:16.948
-Iwoman 1] Hey, guys. Check it out.
-[man 1] What's up, man?

08:17.080 --> 08:20.368
-Iwoman 2] Jeez, what is that?
-[man 2] That's crazy. Look at that.

08:22.669 --> 08:25.411
-[man 3] That's not good.
-[sirens blaring]

08:25.547 --> 08:27.538
[people screaming]

08:33.013 --> 08:34.879
Neither one is answering, sir.

08:42.313 --> 08:44.270
[theme music playing]

08:52.240 --> 08:54.231
[Tom] Senators, hundreds are dead in Taurasi.

08:54.367 --> 08:57.325
Thousands more missing,
including two of my senior staff.

08:57.454 --> 09:00.697
We need to get a handle on this before it
becomes a full-blown humanitarian crisis.

09:00.832 --> 09:01.913
[Feller] And we're sympathetic.

09:02.042 --> 09:05.956
There are 1,500 American tourists
who should be evacuated immediately.

09:06.087 --> 09:08.795
The Eighth Fleet is 100 miles out,
moving in to pick them up.

09:08.923 --> 09:10.664
But there are also 800,000 civilians,

09:10.800 --> 09:13.212
locals, who need fresh water,
food, medical supplies.

09:13.344 --> 09:15.802
All of which they should've thought about
before cutting ties with us.

09:16.639 --> 09:17.925
They haven't formally done that.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.514
If they want out of our influence,

09:19.642 --> 09:21.679
they can't slither back in
when it suits them.

09:21.811 --> 09:25.145
With all due respect, senator, this nation has
a noble history of helping people

09:25.273 --> 09:28.311
when they're in trouble.
Children are dying and we can stop it.

09:29.152 --> 09:30.358
Go ahead. [clears throat]

09:30.487 --> 09:34.321
We can authorize a supplemental
aid package of $3 million.

09:34.449 --> 09:36.941
That's a few dollars a person.
It's cosmetic.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.943
We'll talk to Appropriations
over the next few days,

09:39.079 --> 09:41.821
see what we can come up with.
Best we can do, sir.

09:43.041 --> 09:43.997
Thank you.

09:48.296 --> 09:50.754
Emily, what the hell are you doing back so soon?

09:50.882 --> 09:51.997
My job, sir. I'm fine.

09:52.133 --> 09:53.510
[sighs]

09:54.427 --> 09:56.464
They don't want to reward
a renegade province, sir.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.132
That's part of it.
The other part's political.

09:58.264 --> 10:00.517
You're the savior of Taurasi,
you get a PR bump.

10:00.642 --> 10:03.304
Reduces the pressure on you
to take the AG's deal.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.393
The senators want leverage over you.

10:05.522 --> 10:07.479
I'm not gonna play politics with people's lives.

10:07.607 --> 10:09.974
How much support do we have in Congress
for an aid package?

10:10.110 --> 10:12.021
Some, but not enough
to overcome party leadership.

10:12.153 --> 10:15.271
Ask Kendra if we can circumvent the Congress
with an executive order.

10:15.406 --> 10:17.022
Yes, sir.
Have we heard from Seth or Lyor?

10:17.158 --> 10:20.776
The wave took down the cell towers
and providers are working to restore service.

10:20.912 --> 10:23.028
We're turning over every stone
to find them.

10:24.666 --> 10:27.624
-[Hannah] That kid clocked me.
-Like father, like daughter.

10:27.752 --> 10:28.583
She's scared.

10:28.711 --> 10:31.328
She probably figured out
her father isn't who he said he was.

10:31.464 --> 10:32.966
Which means I could be anybody.

10:33.716 --> 10:36.128
| promised Damian
that I would look after his daughter,

10:36.261 --> 10:38.548
make sure she was safe from Valeria.
That's what I'm gonna do.

10:38.680 --> 10:42.093
She's the only Amy Bleecker under 30
in the Greater London area.

10:42.225 --> 10:43.966
She has to have a place to go.

10:44.102 --> 10:45.513
What about credit card activity?

10:45.645 --> 10:49.138
[Chuck] Repeated purchases of
an Oyster card at the South Burnley tube.

10:49.274 --> 10:51.891
| got an address for a Paul Bleecker
in the neighborhood.

10:52.026 --> 10:54.563
That's Damian's pseudonym.
Send me the details.

10:55.196 --> 10:56.402
On the way.

11:00.493 --> 11:01.244
[knock at door]

11:02.287 --> 11:06.872
Hey, the president's got half the police force
on the island looking for Seth and Lyor.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.116
I've left voicemails, e-mailed them--

11:09.252 --> 11:10.959
You should be home, resting.

11:11.087 --> 11:12.919
Kendra, the president's political future
hangs in the balance.

11:13.047 --> 11:14.299
Thousands of people may die

11:14.424 --> 11:16.631
because Congress would rather
play politics than send aid.

11:16.759 --> 11:18.591
And Seth and Lyor are missing.

11:19.095 --> 11:21.052
Today's not the day
to binge-watch Top Chef.

11:22.432 --> 11:23.263
Okay.

11:24.267 --> 11:26.554
I've checked with
our constitutional law experts.

11:26.686 --> 11:30.554
A multi-billion-dollar foreign aid project
is likely presidential overreach.

11:30.690 --> 11:33.557
Because Congress has budgetary authority.
We need a workaround.

11:33.693 --> 11:37.937
Yes, but the president has access to a lot
of discretionary funds. FEMA. DOD.

11:38.072 --> 11:40.814
Yeah. He can temporarily
reallocate the money.

11:40.950 --> 11:43.908
I'll get the OMB director on it now.
Thank you.

11:58.134 --> 12:02.048
Amy, we need to talk, okay?
I'm not going to hurt you.

12:02.180 --> 12:03.090
Amy!

12:07.727 --> 12:08.808
Amy!

12:12.273 --> 12:15.311
-Amy, stop!
-Come any closer and I'll scream!

12:21.491 --> 12:24.153
Your dad, he liked black tea
in the morning.

12:24.285 --> 12:26.947
He used to sweeten it with marmalade.

12:29.666 --> 12:34.285
The only jokes he'd tell
were knock-knock jokes. Bad ones.

12:36.214 --> 12:40.629
And when he laughed,
his left eyebrow would go up.

12:40.760 --> 12:41.966
[pants]

12:43.638 --> 12:45.003
| cared about him, too.

12:49.269 --> 12:52.182
Amy, someone is trying to hurt you.

12:52.313 --> 12:54.645
I'm not going to let that happen.

12:56.276 --> 12:57.607
Will you come with me?

13:07.370 --> 13:10.954
Lyor, thank God you're okay.
What's it like on the ground?

13:11.499 --> 13:14.662
Bad, sir.
Dozens of hotels were demolished.

13:14.794 --> 13:18.003
Our consulate's gone.
People were swept out to sea.

13:18.131 --> 13:20.338
Tell the governor
we'll do everything we can.

13:20.466 --> 13:23.379
As soon as our ships dock,
they'll unload medical supplies.

13:23.511 --> 13:24.421
| already have.

13:24.554 --> 13:28.263
-But we're in a fight over further aid.
-We need to take this public.

13:28.391 --> 13:30.553
| agree,
but I'd like Seth's input on this.

13:32.145 --> 13:33.306
Seth is still missing, sir.

13:33.438 --> 13:36.351
-What?
-He left the hotel right before the wave hit.

13:38.234 --> 13:39.690
| can't find him.

13:46.200 --> 13:48.453
Your father had something
someone else wanted,

13:48.578 --> 13:51.115
-that they think you might have.
-What is it?

13:51.247 --> 13:52.612
| don't know.

13:52.749 --> 13:54.786
Like you saw, there's nothing in his apartment.

13:54.917 --> 13:58.581
That's why I want you to take me
to his personal storage.

13:59.380 --> 14:02.122
My dad wasn't in the Foreign Service,
was he?

14:02.258 --> 14:03.293
No.

14:03.426 --> 14:05.838
-Can you tell me what he did?
-No.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.508
[Amy] That's okay. I already know.

14:12.268 --> 14:13.554
He did what you do.

14:18.107 --> 14:19.268
Governor, what's the latest?

14:19.400 --> 14:22.062
Hundreds dead, Mr. President.
Many unaccounted for.

14:22.195 --> 14:25.608
Most of the island is without electricity,
including our hospitals.

14:25.740 --> 14:27.822
The provisions from your navy
weren't enough.

14:27.950 --> 14:31.989
| understand. Congress has approved
a provisional aid package of $3 million.

14:32.121 --> 14:35.489
- I can get that to you immediately.
-$3 million?

14:35.625 --> 14:37.912
That's not aid, that's tokenism.

14:39.045 --> 14:41.707
Sir, I realize how hypocritical
| must sound now,

14:41.839 --> 14:44.957
but Taurasi needs America's help.

14:45.093 --> 14:48.051
Governor, I need you to trust me.
I'm gonna do everything I can.

14:51.766 --> 14:53.256
Lyor, have you heard from Seth?

14:53.393 --> 14:54.258
Not yet.

14:55.728 --> 14:57.469
The operative word being "yet.”

14:57.605 --> 14:59.437
-Keep looking.
-[Lyor] Yes, sir.

14:59.565 --> 15:02.853
Kendra says Congress got an injunction
to stop the president's executive order.

15:02.985 --> 15:04.851
She needs to make an immediate appeal.

15:04.987 --> 15:07.194
She is. DC circuit affirmed,
she's appealing to the Supreme Court.

15:07.323 --> 15:09.155
Good. Have you reached out to our allies?

15:09.283 --> 15:11.445
| have, but they say
Taurasi's an American territory,

15:11.577 --> 15:14.069
and the richest country in the world
can take care of its own.

15:14.205 --> 15:15.695
Call in favors. Beg if you have to,

15:15.832 --> 15:17.698
but we need the international community
to step up.

15:17.834 --> 15:18.665
Yes, sir.

15:22.296 --> 15:23.752
My dad kept a safe here.

15:27.176 --> 15:28.712
You're sure you know the combination?

15:28.845 --> 15:32.008
If I didn't, can't you just whip out
your liquid nitrogen?

15:32.140 --> 15:34.677
Yeah, sure, it's in my shoe next to my ray gun.

15:38.146 --> 15:38.977
Damn it.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.855
-Amy, what was in here?
- I have no idea.

15:46.863 --> 15:50.652
You have no idea? You knew where this was.
You had the combination to the safe.

15:50.783 --> 15:52.774
You never came here
when your dad was traveling?

15:53.494 --> 15:55.201
How do I know this isn't some long con?

15:55.329 --> 15:56.911
-Some what?
-You gain my trust,

15:57.039 --> 15:59.417
let me lead you
to what you're looking for, then kill me.

15:59.542 --> 16:00.373
Amy...

16:01.836 --> 16:05.329
Do you wanna know what's difficult
about what I do? About what your dad did?

16:05.465 --> 16:08.378
Sometimes you need to take what you think
you know, throw it out the window

16:08.509 --> 16:10.887
and follow your instincts
because your life depends on it.

16:12.805 --> 16:13.886
[sighs]

16:15.057 --> 16:16.138
Good luck.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.842
It was a list of names.

16:19.896 --> 16:21.102
Five pages.

16:21.230 --> 16:23.392
-Is there a copy?
-No.

16:24.901 --> 16:26.938
Then that doesn't do us any good.

16:27.069 --> 16:31.859
[Amy] Mark Abercrombie. 2642 Drury Lane,
Apartment 12D, Staffordshire, England.

16:31.991 --> 16:35.950
David Appel, 161 Rue Etoile, Unit 3,
La-Celle-Saint-Cloud, France.

16:36.078 --> 16:38.115
-Anne Avondale--
-[Hannah] Wait a minute.

16:38.581 --> 16:41.164
-You memorized the whole list?
-Yes.

16:41.709 --> 16:43.325
Why?

16:43.461 --> 16:45.452
| can't help it.
| have a photographic memory.

16:46.756 --> 16:48.747
Hang on to that photo. Let's go.

16:54.889 --> 16:56.254
-Hey.
-[Leo] Hey.

16:57.225 --> 17:00.092
-If this is a bad time, I can come back.
-[Emily] Come on in.

17:00.853 --> 17:02.969
Thanks. I appreciate it.

17:03.105 --> 17:04.686
Sure. What's up?

17:04.815 --> 17:06.943
| was hoping for some college advice.

17:07.068 --> 17:09.560
Georgetown, my alma mater.
Congratulations.

17:09.694 --> 17:11.777
I'll have to give you the skinny
on all the dorms.

17:11.906 --> 17:13.738
Actually, it's about Stanford.

17:15.076 --> 17:16.066
| got in there, too.

17:16.202 --> 17:19.819
-That's amazing.
-Not really. My dad doesn't know I applied.

17:19.955 --> 17:21.242
So talk to him.

17:21.999 --> 17:24.457
[chuckles] Sure. That's easy.

17:25.419 --> 17:27.672
"Hey, Dad, I know you have a few things
on your plate,

17:27.797 --> 17:31.540
but I want to move 3,000 miles away
to a college you don't know I applied to."

17:31.884 --> 17:32.965
Just like that.

17:33.469 --> 17:35.255
He's not gonna like it.

17:35.388 --> 17:37.925
What he's not gonna like most
is that I didn't tell him.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.094
And we're gonna get into this big argument,

17:40.226 --> 17:42.638
and I'm thinking he has enough stuff
to worry about today.

17:42.770 --> 17:45.262
He worries about you most of all.

17:47.775 --> 17:49.607
| wouldn't even know where to begin.

17:51.320 --> 17:54.654
Just start with the unvarnished truth.

17:56.284 --> 17:57.740
That's usually what works best with him.

18:01.747 --> 18:03.124
You got this.

18:04.584 --> 18:05.415
Thanks.

18:11.882 --> 18:15.967
Hey, my contact at the Supreme Court says
they're not likely to hear the appeal.

18:16.762 --> 18:19.174
-"Cause it's a political hot potato.
-Yep.

18:20.558 --> 18:21.798
[Kendra] Where are you going?

18:22.643 --> 18:25.556
[reporter on TV] Hundreds are dead,
hundreds more remain missing

18:25.688 --> 18:29.101
as the death toll continues to climb
hours after a devastating tsunami...

18:29.233 --> 18:31.725
-I have the chief justice for you.
-I'll take it.

18:31.861 --> 18:32.646
No, sir, he's here.

18:34.363 --> 18:35.194
Send him in.

18:40.286 --> 18:41.902
Peter, what a surprise.
Good to see you.

18:42.038 --> 18:44.621
[sighs]
I'm afraid it's not a social call, Mr. President.

18:45.207 --> 18:47.164
We missed you
at Judge Putnam's memorial today.

18:47.293 --> 18:49.785
Unfortunately, there was too much work here
to get away.

18:49.920 --> 18:51.627
I'm glad Emily made it in your stead.

18:52.715 --> 18:55.798
I'm not glad she took the occasion
to try to influence our calendar.

18:56.552 --> 18:58.589
-Excuse me?
-Your executive order,

18:58.721 --> 19:00.712
which has been enjoined by the lower courts,

19:00.848 --> 19:02.680
the White House wants us to hear the case.

19:02.808 --> 19:03.923
That's correct.

19:04.060 --> 19:07.849
Is it appropriate for
your Chief of Staff to corner me about it?

19:08.856 --> 19:09.971
Of course not.

19:10.107 --> 19:13.441
Good. I shouldn't have to lecture
the president about separation of powers.

19:13.569 --> 19:16.527
-She didn't do this at my request.
- I find that hard to believe.

19:16.656 --> 19:19.273
However, I accept full responsibility
for her actions.

19:19.408 --> 19:21.365
Having said that, did she discuss substance?

19:21.494 --> 19:24.782
No. But at the Supreme Court,
procedure is substance.

19:24.914 --> 19:28.532
You influence the outcome of a case
by merely getting it on the calendar.

19:28.668 --> 19:32.252
It was an ex parte communication
and you should fire her.

19:33.422 --> 19:34.583
Damn it.

19:39.095 --> 19:40.927
Get me Emily Rhodes. Now.

19:46.602 --> 19:50.470
Emily, how many times has
the chief justice visited the White House?

19:50.606 --> 19:51.437
Never, sir.

19:51.565 --> 19:54.603
Right, for the same reasons
that I don't visit his chambers.

19:54.735 --> 19:56.237
Because of the appearance of impropriety.

19:56.362 --> 19:58.979
| wasn't trying to... I didn't...

19:59.115 --> 20:02.528
The walls are closing in on us, sir.
Leadership is conspiring. People are dying.

20:02.660 --> 20:03.741
Seth is missing--

20:03.869 --> 20:06.577
Emily, I understand, but I'm facing
a potential constitutional crisis

20:06.706 --> 20:07.992
because of these pending charges.

20:08.124 --> 20:11.708
| cannot afford another one
"cause you wanna influence the judiciary.

20:12.294 --> 20:14.331
-Yes, sir.
-The Supreme Court denied our petition.

20:14.463 --> 20:16.124
Our judicial option is gone.

20:17.258 --> 20:20.000
Well, I didn't expect them
to wade into this political crisis.

20:20.136 --> 20:22.252
What other options do we have?

20:22.388 --> 20:25.471
A unilateral exercise
of presidential authority.

20:25.599 --> 20:26.304
Defiance of Congress...

20:26.434 --> 20:29.517
You go that route, you don't have to worry
about criminal charges.

20:29.645 --> 20:30.976
You'll have to worry about impeachment.

20:32.648 --> 20:37.142
| took the liberty of ordering us a bottle
of wine. I assume you like Bordeaux.

20:37.278 --> 20:39.610
-When my billings are up, sure.
-[Cornelius chuckles]

20:40.156 --> 20:43.319
I'm a busy man these days, Mr. West,
so let me get right to the point.

20:44.076 --> 20:46.067
I'd like to hire you as a senior advisor.

20:47.163 --> 20:49.450
-For your presidential campaign?
-Yes.

20:50.458 --> 20:53.371
You are an asset. And I need assets.

20:53.502 --> 20:57.587
Well, that's very kind, sir.
But I'm quite happy in private practice.

20:57.715 --> 20:59.422
| have no doubt you are happy.

21:00.092 --> 21:04.507
But one way or another, there is going
to be a changing of the guard soon...

21:05.431 --> 21:06.967
which might affect your clientele.

21:08.434 --> 21:09.924
Sir, what are we talking about here?

21:10.060 --> 21:13.974
We're talking about establishing
a mutually beneficial relationship.

21:14.815 --> 21:17.227
The AG appointed you to look into me,

21:17.359 --> 21:21.023
and instead you found misconduct
on the part of the president.

21:21.947 --> 21:24.325
-Do you know what I call that?
-No.

21:24.450 --> 21:26.032
Flexibility.

21:26.160 --> 21:29.073
Sir, I wasn't trying to be flexible.
| was trying to be a prosecutor.

21:29.205 --> 21:31.663
-Following my mandate.
-Yes. Good.

21:32.333 --> 21:35.325
You need justification
for pursuing the president.

21:35.461 --> 21:38.044
| have justification. Facts and the law.

21:40.466 --> 21:42.332
Indeed.

21:42.468 --> 21:45.381
| ordered us a couple of rib eyes.
Thank you.

21:46.347 --> 21:51.217
Well, let's dig in.
Then we'll talk about your future, huh?

21:54.480 --> 21:55.345
It's a NOC list.

21:55.481 --> 21:59.349
The names and addresses of every
British agent posted at home and abroad.

21:59.485 --> 22:01.067
What was Damian doing with it?

22:01.195 --> 22:04.187
My guess, what you think
a Russian spy was doing.

22:04.323 --> 22:06.109
If Valeria gives it to Moscow--

22:06.242 --> 22:08.028
They'd forgive her
for moonlighting for Dax Minter.

22:08.160 --> 22:11.528
-Except Valeria has one big loose end.
-Amy.

22:12.081 --> 22:13.992
She's afraid the kid knows
about the list, too.

22:14.124 --> 22:15.580
If Amy talks to British intelligence--

22:15.709 --> 22:18.292
MI6 will scramble its assets,
making the list worthless.

22:18.420 --> 22:21.879
-If Valeria wants to save herself--
-She has to kill Amy.

22:23.425 --> 22:25.712
-We've got to move now.
-Why?

22:25.845 --> 22:29.008
There is a bigger price on your head
than I thought. Let's go.

22:33.769 --> 22:37.353
[Lyor] Excuse me.
Have you seen this guy with the beard? No?

22:38.899 --> 22:39.764
[chainsaw whirring]

22:39.900 --> 22:41.857
Uh, excuse me. Excuse me.

22:41.986 --> 22:45.195
Have you seen this man?
Have you seen this guy?

22:46.532 --> 22:47.943
-No.
-You sure?

22:48.659 --> 22:50.070
[birds squawking]

22:56.959 --> 23:00.543
Seth. Seth! Hey!

23:02.298 --> 23:04.960
I'm sorry,
| thought you were someone else.

23:05.092 --> 23:05.957
[Seth] Lyor!

23:09.680 --> 23:11.637
Seth! Seth!

23:12.349 --> 23:13.430
-Hey!
-Lyor!

23:14.560 --> 23:17.473
-Hey! No, don't do that.
-I'm so glad you're okay, man.

23:17.605 --> 23:20.222
-Me? I thought you were dead.
-[Seth] No, I lucked out.

23:20.357 --> 23:24.021
| was in line for my cappuccino
when this guy's brother called.

23:24.153 --> 23:25.860
He's a pilot. He warned us.

23:25.988 --> 23:28.400
| saw the tsunami hit from the roof.

23:29.158 --> 23:30.319
You were on the roof?

23:30.451 --> 23:33.864
Yeah. Then I met a cop with a motorboat,
he gave me a tour of the damage.

23:33.996 --> 23:35.987
We need to talk to the president.

23:38.751 --> 23:40.082
He was on the roof.

23:44.089 --> 23:45.671
| toured the southern part of the island.

23:45.799 --> 23:49.337
There's massive looting, rioting.
It's a virtual war zone.

23:49.470 --> 23:53.509
Yes. We lack the police force
to come to grips with this sort of chaos,

23:53.641 --> 23:55.348
which is why we're begging America
for its help.

23:55.476 --> 23:56.807
As soon as you sign the referendum.

23:56.936 --> 23:59.052
I have no intention of signing that.

23:59.188 --> 24:01.475
Now, more than ever,
we need to be a US protectorate.

24:01.607 --> 24:03.063
Governor, Congress refuses to help.

24:03.192 --> 24:05.433
My executive order was struck down.
My hands are tied.

24:05.569 --> 24:08.561
-Only you can untie them.
-I don't understand.

24:08.697 --> 24:11.314
The key is what Seth said. War zone.

24:11.450 --> 24:12.736
Eight years ago, Congress passed

24:12.868 --> 24:16.406
a broad authorization for the use
of military force. AUMF.

24:16.538 --> 24:18.154
So if Taurasi's not a protectorate--

24:18.290 --> 24:19.246
We can help you.

24:19.375 --> 24:22.788
We need to create - at least on paper -
a state of potential conflict.

24:22.920 --> 24:24.536
-Yes, sir.
-[Tom] Thank you.

24:24.672 --> 24:28.006
Seth, I can't even begin to tell you
how relieved we are that you're okay.

24:28.133 --> 24:29.544
| can't imagine what you've been through.

24:30.302 --> 24:32.384
-[Seth] Thank you, sir.
-[Tom] Godspeed.

24:36.892 --> 24:40.260
-Respectfully, sir, this is beneath you.
-[Tom] Excuse me, senator?

24:40.396 --> 24:43.138
Protecting our nation
from its sworn enemies is beneath me?

24:43.273 --> 24:44.855
But, sir, that's not what you're doing.

24:44.984 --> 24:47.817
As the courts have affirmed,
Congress has the power of the purse.

24:47.945 --> 24:51.609
This isn't a budgetary issue.
This is the proper exercise of the AUMF.

24:51.740 --> 24:54.778
Three billion dollars?
And none of this is military.

24:54.910 --> 24:57.868
You're dispatching food,
medicine, generators--

24:57.997 --> 25:00.705
The express terms of the AUMF
do not restrict the type of aid.

25:00.833 --> 25:04.622
The president can provide tanks,
syringes, money, showgirls...

25:04.753 --> 25:06.960
And there's nothing unconstitutional
about any of it.

25:07.089 --> 25:11.583
Being hailed as Taurasi's savior won't stop
the AG from bringing charges, sir.

25:11.719 --> 25:13.209
That's what you don't understand.

25:13.345 --> 25:17.555
I'm not doing this to be expedient.
I'm doing this because it's the right thing.

25:17.683 --> 25:19.265
And what you don't understand

25:19.393 --> 25:21.930
is that your definition of right
often entails expedience.

25:23.105 --> 25:24.595
That's why you're in trouble.

25:37.453 --> 25:39.615
[Tom] Hey. Come on in. Sit down.

25:45.294 --> 25:47.752
First, I wanna say congratulations.

25:47.880 --> 25:49.621
Stanford is fantastic.

25:51.633 --> 25:52.464
It is.

25:53.927 --> 25:56.305
Second thing. Why didn't you tell me?

25:56.430 --> 25:58.967
I'd already applied. Then Mom died.

26:00.392 --> 26:03.475
- I didn't know how to bring it up.
- I wish you had.

26:03.604 --> 26:05.094
I've known for months.

26:09.068 --> 26:10.934
| keep forgetting you're pretty well-informed.

26:11.070 --> 26:14.358
President of Stanford
is on my Council of Economic Advisors.

26:14.490 --> 26:17.528
She told me how thrilled she was
that you had applied.

26:17.659 --> 26:20.947
-Why didn't you say something?
-'Cause I wanted it to come from you.

26:22.831 --> 26:23.662
I'm sorry.

26:26.418 --> 26:28.830
You've got a big choice to make.
What are you gonna do?

26:29.838 --> 26:31.704
The decision's made.
| can't leave you.

26:31.840 --> 26:33.672
-You're all alone.
-No, I'm not.

26:34.343 --> 26:37.881
You are. I live under the same roof
and I barely see you as it is.

26:38.013 --> 26:39.378
Okay. I'll do better.

26:39.515 --> 26:42.223
You can't do better if I'm on the other side
of the country.

26:42.351 --> 26:46.310
| mean, you can, but...
You don't even know how to Skype.

26:46.438 --> 26:49.100
I'll get someone to help me.
I'm the president.

26:49.233 --> 26:50.268
Look...

26:50.943 --> 26:52.775
| want to be there
for you and Penny.

26:55.239 --> 26:56.695
Isn't that a good thing?

26:58.867 --> 26:59.777
No.

27:01.328 --> 27:02.409
[Leo] I don't understand.

27:02.538 --> 27:04.905
You will when you have your own children.

27:05.040 --> 27:08.158
All you'll want for them
is for their dreams to come true.

27:10.254 --> 27:11.494
This is what I want.

27:12.464 --> 27:14.671
This is what your mother would've wanted.

27:18.387 --> 27:20.173
This has been a terrible year.

27:24.643 --> 27:27.010
| wouldn't have gotten through it
without you.

27:31.150 --> 27:33.312
But we both made it. [chuckles]

27:34.987 --> 27:38.070
Yeah. Yeah, we did.

27:40.075 --> 27:42.032
You've got your mother's strength.

27:43.370 --> 27:45.737
She would be so proud of you right now.

27:47.249 --> 27:48.410
I'm proud.

27:55.174 --> 27:58.292
-[Amy] What are you doing?
-Telling the world you're home.

27:58.427 --> 28:01.670
Why? If this woman's after me,
we need to get out of here now.

28:01.805 --> 28:05.218
Then what? I know her.
She won't stop until she finds you.

28:08.270 --> 28:10.637
She killed my dad, didn't she?

28:10.772 --> 28:11.853
[song playing on radio]

28:15.944 --> 28:16.854
Yeah.

28:19.364 --> 28:22.482
But she's not hunting you anymore.
We're hunting her.

28:22.618 --> 28:26.282
Stay away from the windows, lock the door
and do not answer it. No matter what.

28:41.303 --> 28:42.589
[sighs]

28:47.226 --> 28:47.966
Mr. President.

28:48.101 --> 28:51.810
| just got word: aid is being flown
into the crisis zone as we speak.

28:51.939 --> 28:53.054
Good work, sir.

28:53.732 --> 28:54.893
For all of us.

28:55.025 --> 28:58.108
I'm going to need to address the nation
before these charges become public.

28:58.237 --> 29:00.854
| anticipated that and I spoke
with the networks, blocked out time.

29:00.989 --> 29:02.946
That's why you're such
a great Chief of Staff.

29:06.161 --> 29:08.653
| don't think I've been
a great Chief of Staff, sir.

29:08.789 --> 29:10.655
| don't I've even been a good one.

29:16.171 --> 29:17.252
My resignation.

29:22.928 --> 29:25.340
Emily, these have been a very tough
couple of days.

29:25.472 --> 29:26.553
It's not that.

29:26.682 --> 29:29.299
Then talk to me.
| don't want to lose you.

29:30.519 --> 29:33.728
All day, everyone has been
telling me to go home.

29:33.855 --> 29:37.519
And I can't. I can't take a day off.

29:37.651 --> 29:39.187
Because this is your home.

29:40.445 --> 29:41.651
And I've lost my way.

29:41.780 --> 29:43.521
-[Tom] No, you haven't.
-I have.

29:43.657 --> 29:45.989
Look, you're under a lot of stress.
We'll lighten your workload.

29:46.118 --> 29:48.234
-It's not the workload.
-Then what is it?

29:48.370 --> 29:51.829
| told Chuck he didn't need a warrant
to get a reporter's phone records.

29:51.957 --> 29:54.790
Now, I'm confronting
a Supreme Court justice for--

29:54.918 --> 29:57.125
This happens to all of us.
You're holding on too tight.

29:57.254 --> 30:00.212
| am. And that doesn't help you.
It hurts you.

30:01.508 --> 30:03.215
If I don't walk away,

30:03.343 --> 30:06.301
I'm afraid I might do something
you can't take back.

30:06.430 --> 30:09.968
-[Janet] Sir, I have Ethan West for you.
-Okay. Thank you.

30:17.566 --> 30:20.149
You will always have a seat next to me.

30:25.866 --> 30:27.823
Mr. West, I don't have time for you right now.

30:27.951 --> 30:29.908
This will just take a moment.

30:31.330 --> 30:32.661
Uh...

30:32.789 --> 30:35.952
-President Moss offered me a job today.
-Good for you.

30:36.084 --> 30:38.701
I'm not gonna take it.
He thinks I'm somebody I'm not.

30:38.837 --> 30:40.453
Well, I know exactly what you are.

30:40.589 --> 30:42.580
A good lawyer who'd do anything
for his clients.

30:42.716 --> 30:45.174
If you're here to deliver
a mission statement, please...

30:45.302 --> 30:46.918
No, more of a realization.

30:47.596 --> 30:51.089
Moss is working with Congress,
who are working with your AG.

30:51.224 --> 30:52.965
Everyone's working an angle.

30:53.101 --> 30:56.935
You're just realizing that now?
How long have you been in Washington?

30:57.064 --> 30:59.431
Long enough to recognize
someone who's not working an angle.

31:00.817 --> 31:01.932
And that's you.

31:04.613 --> 31:06.445
You don't scheme.

31:08.367 --> 31:09.778
You serve.

31:11.953 --> 31:14.741
My days of service may be done soon.

31:14.873 --> 31:16.955
That's 'cause you don't compromise.

31:18.794 --> 31:20.785
But there's value in not compromising.

31:22.297 --> 31:24.834
-What's this?
-Something you gave to me.

31:24.966 --> 31:26.377
And I'm giving it back.

31:27.803 --> 31:29.419
Hope it helps.

31:40.732 --> 31:41.813
[chuckles]

31:48.240 --> 31:49.901
[rock song playing over stereo]

32:09.136 --> 32:09.921
[clattering]

32:13.974 --> 32:15.681
[both grunting]

33:13.408 --> 33:14.193
[Valeria panting]

33:14.326 --> 33:15.612
I'm taking you in.

33:15.744 --> 33:16.859
No, you're not.

33:17.913 --> 33:23.374
You're a former FBI agent in England,
with no authority to do anything.

33:23.502 --> 33:24.992
Tell it to the judge.

33:25.128 --> 33:27.836
| will. And you know what he will say?

33:28.590 --> 33:31.048
That I have diplomatic immunity.

33:33.553 --> 33:34.338
Not with me.

33:37.474 --> 33:38.930
[grunts]

33:51.196 --> 33:53.062
Do svidanya.

34:07.712 --> 34:11.956
Governor, I am privileged to finally
tell you relief is on its way.

34:12.092 --> 34:13.958
[sighs] Thank you, sir.

34:14.094 --> 34:17.337
We've also deployed 5,000 American troops
to help you keep the peace.

34:17.472 --> 34:18.507
[Habalo] / am grateful.

34:18.639 --> 34:21.007
As I expect our people to be

34:21.141 --> 34:25.601
when they vote on a new referendum
to restore our status as a protectorate,

34:25.730 --> 34:27.766
which I expect to pass overwhelmingly.

34:29.234 --> 34:30.724
Thank you, Mr. President.

34:31.235 --> 34:32.818
And you are our president.

34:33.989 --> 34:36.275
Thank you, Governor. Talk to you soon.

34:37.659 --> 34:39.696
-Great work, Aaron.
-Mr. President.

34:39.828 --> 34:41.659
-[Tom] Well done.
-Thank you, sir.

34:48.253 --> 34:49.004
[sighs]

34:50.714 --> 34:54.127
Our flight doesn't leave for a few hours. We're
gonna have to watch the president's address here.

34:54.259 --> 34:55.795
What do you think he'll say?

34:56.844 --> 35:00.429
| don't know.
He's playing this one close to the vest.

35:02.809 --> 35:06.097
You know, um, when the tsunami hit, um...

35:07.147 --> 35:08.603
| was worried about you, man.

35:11.276 --> 35:13.108
| was worried about you, too.

35:14.529 --> 35:19.444
Worried you wouldn't find a biscotti
for your cappuccino, that is. [chuckles]

35:19.576 --> 35:23.695
But you seem to have come through it all right.
A near-death experience.

35:23.830 --> 35:25.912
Think of the stories
you'll be able to tell your grandkids.

35:26.041 --> 35:28.703
About your view from the roof. [chuckles]

35:29.878 --> 35:31.994
I'll go check on our flight.

35:36.551 --> 35:38.053
[woman] What's that man's name?

35:39.387 --> 35:40.218
Why?

35:41.890 --> 35:43.847
Because he saved my family.

35:44.476 --> 35:46.683
Carried my grandchildren to the roof.

35:49.689 --> 35:50.520
[clicks tongue]

35:51.733 --> 35:52.723
His name's Seth.

35:54.402 --> 35:56.393
And he's my friend.

36:01.326 --> 36:03.408
-[ambulance siren blaring]
-Hey, taxi!

36:06.665 --> 36:08.247
[Amy] That's not how you do it.

36:09.876 --> 36:12.914
It's actually against the law
to yell "taxi" at a moving cab.

36:13.046 --> 36:13.956
They won't stop.

36:14.089 --> 36:16.626
Look for the light,
then stick your arm out.

36:16.758 --> 36:18.419
What are you doing here?

36:18.551 --> 36:21.088
| knew your flight
because of your calendar.

36:21.221 --> 36:22.677
Which is on my phone.

36:22.806 --> 36:25.264
Which I hacked into
when you were in the bathroom.

36:26.351 --> 36:28.012
You still haven't answered my question.

36:29.938 --> 36:33.897
My dad, he was the only family I had.
My only relative.

36:34.025 --> 36:35.265
Oh, no way!

36:35.402 --> 36:37.313
There's nothing here for me, Hannah.

36:37.445 --> 36:39.823
Nobody who will look out for me now.

36:39.948 --> 36:41.279
You looked out for me.

36:45.620 --> 36:47.031
[Hannah] Oh, man.

36:47.580 --> 36:50.322
Look, I'm not your mother.
And I'm not your big sister.

36:50.458 --> 36:52.950
And I'm not your friend, okay?

36:54.045 --> 36:58.460
Do what I say, when I say it,
or I ship you back here in a crate.

37:04.264 --> 37:05.925
This is a terrible idea.

37:13.648 --> 37:17.391
| feel for Taurasi,
but we have a Constitution.

37:18.153 --> 37:21.271
Checks and balances. Separation of powers.

37:22.240 --> 37:24.481
Tom Kirkman has tried to end-run it all.

37:24.909 --> 37:26.240
Five-minute warning, sir.

37:26.369 --> 37:28.531
-[Cornelius] That's not a president, Mike.
-Thank you.

37:28.663 --> 37:29.778
[Cornelius] That's an emperor.

37:37.839 --> 37:40.331
You've had my back a lot
over these last couple of years.

37:40.467 --> 37:41.502
Yes, sir.

37:42.635 --> 37:44.797
What if this is the end of the road, Mike?

37:46.681 --> 37:49.013
Then it's been an honor, sir.

37:54.105 --> 37:55.607
The honor is all mine.

37:58.526 --> 37:59.937
Let's do this.

38:21.549 --> 38:22.539
All right.

38:23.843 --> 38:25.220
[indistinct chatter]

38:32.811 --> 38:34.973
-Senators.
-Mr. President.

38:43.154 --> 38:44.815
Good evening, my fellow Americans.

38:45.406 --> 38:49.616
| am speaking to you tonight because
this is a critical time in my administration.

38:49.744 --> 38:52.406
A time when I must address
the future of my presidency.

39:03.758 --> 39:04.543
[Tom] Open it.

39:08.513 --> 39:10.720
-It's blank.
-[Tom] That is correct.

39:10.849 --> 39:12.465
| have no terms.

39:12.600 --> 39:15.388
If I can't convince the people
that I've been working with

39:15.520 --> 39:17.761
that based on everything that I've done,

39:17.897 --> 39:20.685
| have earned the right to remain president,
| don't want the job.

39:21.860 --> 39:23.521
| have no terms.

39:28.533 --> 39:32.197
| will continue to speak the truth,
to work for all of you

39:32.787 --> 39:34.698
without compromise, without fear,

39:35.373 --> 39:36.363
without terms,

39:37.625 --> 39:39.832
because that's what
the American people deserve.

39:39.961 --> 39:40.792
Oh, my God.

39:40.920 --> 39:42.581
He can't do it now.
We're not prepared.

39:42.714 --> 39:47.299
Someone who puts them first,
who won't quit until the job is finished,

39:47.427 --> 39:51.216
which is why I'm announcing my candidacy
for reelection to the office of president,

39:51.347 --> 39:52.633
as an Independent...

39:54.392 --> 39:57.305
free from the constraints
of party politics.

39:57.437 --> 39:59.144
Thank you for this time.

39:59.272 --> 40:01.013
God bless you,

40:01.149 --> 40:03.811
and God bless
these United States of America.

40:08.114 --> 40:09.525
What just happened?

40:09.657 --> 40:12.319
It looks like our boy
threw down the gauntlet.

40:12.452 --> 40:14.113
[Kendra] And guess who picked it up?

40:43.775 --> 40:44.765
[Hannah] Emily?

40:47.946 --> 40:48.936
What the hell?

41:12.887 --> 41:15.379
[Janet] Mr. President,
| have the AG for you.

41:16.057 --> 41:17.468
Thank you, Janet.

41:33.866 --> 41:36.403
Mr. Attorney General,
this is the president.
