WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:03.565
Come on, let's just go to the marina, we'll rent a sail boat

00:03.630 --> 00:05.200
and spend the whole day on the water.

00:05.260 --> 00:06.460
Hey. Please, stop it.

00:06.530 --> 00:08.560
It's not fair, ok, to Delia.

00:08.930 --> 00:10.360
We haven't been out in 3 days,

00:10.430 --> 00:12.560
And she's, you know, at the store alone.

00:12.630 --> 00:14.000
3 days? What's that?

00:14.060 --> 00:16.200
After what we've been through, we deserve a week.

00:16.200 --> 00:17.770
Look, why don't we take the train to ocean city?

00:17.800 --> 00:19.270
There's that little inn we used to go to.

00:19.340 --> 00:21.870
We could spend the whole day there by ourselves.

00:22.840 --> 00:23.770
What's wrong?

00:24.640 --> 00:27.200
Nothing. It's just...

00:27.270 --> 00:29.800
Waking up with you and talking to you,

00:29.870 --> 00:31.970
I never thought I'd get to do that again.

00:37.500 --> 00:39.140
Well, we're doing it.

00:40.870 --> 00:42.305
I'm not going anywhere.

00:42.305 --> 00:43.740
We just have to get back to normal.

00:43.800 --> 00:45.300
Normal?

00:49.500 --> 00:53.040
All right,guys. Let's unload this equipment.

00:54.700 --> 00:57.000
Little redecorating, and this'll work just fine.

00:57.070 --> 00:59.200
Oh, what about the town square out front?

00:59.270 --> 01:00.670
- It's available until midnight.  - Perfect.

01:00.740 --> 01:03.370
What's going on, and who are these people?

01:03.440 --> 01:06.070
Ok, you'll never believe. That is Cally O'Keefe.

01:06.140 --> 01:09.470
She is the creator and the head writer of Hope's Edge...

01:09.540 --> 01:12.370
And they wanna film right here in the store.

01:12.440 --> 01:13.700
Hope's Edge?

01:13.770 --> 01:14.900
Yeah, the soap opera.

01:14.970 --> 01:16.940
Uh, I used to watch it at the station with the guys.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.140
Well,F.Y.I., she prefers Daytime serial.

01:20.200 --> 01:22.000
I think we should get rid of all of those here...

01:22.070 --> 01:23.300
And she's directing this one.

01:23.370 --> 01:25.270
Apparently it's the tenth anniversary of the show.

01:25.340 --> 01:27.600
They're filming the whole thing right here in Grandview.

01:27.670 --> 01:29.970
Hello. Back to earth. Did you actually say yes?

01:30.040 --> 01:31.040
No. Of course not.

01:31.100 --> 01:32.040
We can always tell her no.

01:32.100 --> 01:33.370
I just think it would be

01:33.440 --> 01:34.770
great publicity for the store.

01:34.840 --> 01:36.140
Yeah,but what's gonna be left of the store

01:36.140 --> 01:37.440
when they're done?

01:37.500 --> 01:39.000
Eh,good point.

01:39.070 --> 01:41.200
Hey,Cal. Hmm?

01:41.270 --> 01:43.440
Oh...my...

01:43.500 --> 01:44.440
God.

01:44.500 --> 01:45.440
Oh, my god.

01:45.500 --> 01:46.570
Easy,kid

01:46.640 --> 01:48.670
Can we talk about the scene in the cemetery?

01:48.740 --> 01:50.040
The language feels a little cruel.

01:50.100 --> 01:52.000
Well, you're not yourself, remember?

01:52.070 --> 01:53.440
Look,just...just give me 2 seconds,

01:53.500 --> 01:54.200
and we'll talk about it.

01:54.270 --> 01:56.140
Who is that?

01:56.200 --> 01:58.070
You are so hopeless.

01:58.140 --> 01:59.600
That is Grant Harper.

01:59.670 --> 02:01.570
Yeah,he plays the surgeon on the show.

02:01.640 --> 02:03.700
Yeah, and he just got diagnosed with this brain tumor,

02:03.770 --> 02:05.340
so he's having blackouts all the time.

02:05.400 --> 02:06.770
Oh, my god, and he's still working?

02:06.840 --> 02:07.740
Oh. No, not on the...

02:07.800 --> 02:09.539
No, it's his character on the show.

02:09.600 --> 02:11.240
He plays Dr. Troy Dolden, right?

02:11.300 --> 02:12.670
So he has this on-again, off-again

02:12.740 --> 02:13.670
love-hate relationship

02:13.740 --> 02:14.900
- with Celeste... - Celeste.

02:14.970 --> 02:17.140
Barrington, and... she's the owner of the hospital.

02:17.200 --> 02:18.940
And he has these blackouts, and he...he becomes evil,

02:19.000 --> 02:20.770
but he can't remember after it happens.

02:20.840 --> 02:23.770
I... It's really addictive.

02:24.770 --> 02:26.040
Yeah, I...I just don't think the fans

02:26.100 --> 02:27.770
Wanna hear me talk to Celeste that way.

02:27.840 --> 02:28.800
I will look at it. Promise.

02:28.870 --> 02:30.270
Uh, don't you have that photo shoot right now?

02:30.340 --> 02:32.440
- Yeah.  - Come on.

02:32.500 --> 02:34.200
It's perfect.

02:34.270 --> 02:35.240
We'll take it.

02:35.300 --> 02:36.240
Oh. That's, um...

02:36.300 --> 02:37.570
Oh,gosh. Cally, I'm sorry.

02:37.640 --> 02:39.940
This is my business partner I was telling you about.

02:40.000 --> 02:40.940
This is Melinda. Hi.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.100
And this is her, um... wow.

02:42.170 --> 02:43.100
Sam. Sam.

02:43.170 --> 02:46.000
This is Sam. And, uh, this is Duff.

02:46.070 --> 02:47.140
Faraday, first assistant director.

02:47.200 --> 02:48.170
Hello. Nice to meet you.

02:48.240 --> 02:50.440
You have such lovely things in your store.

02:50.500 --> 02:51.670
Oh, well, thank you. Anyway...

02:51.680 --> 02:53.240
Oh, and,Duff, we need to make sure we get these guys

02:53.310 --> 02:55.710
V.I.P. Passes to the thing at the university tonight.

02:55.780 --> 02:56.610
What thing?

02:56.780 --> 02:58.210
An evening with Hope's Edge.

02:58.280 --> 02:59.710
We're screening highlights from the show.

02:59.780 --> 03:01.380
Some of the cast members are gonna do a Q&A.

03:01.440 --> 03:02.810
- Oh, I...I don't know if I... - Cool.

03:02.880 --> 03:03.940
Oh, we would love to go.

03:04.010 --> 03:05.440
Ok. Well, I'm just a little worried

03:05.510 --> 03:06.880
about losing a whole day of business,so...

03:06.940 --> 03:08.910
Compensation's in paragraph 6.

03:08.980 --> 03:11.710
Really? For one day.

03:11.780 --> 03:13.840
Plus a day of prep, with an option to extend,

03:13.910 --> 03:15.380
plus 50% in case Cally goes over schedule.

03:15.440 --> 03:17.580
Nobody's going over schedule.

03:17.640 --> 03:20.210
You know what? Take as long as you need.

03:22.640 --> 03:25.610
So... I haven't seen you much for the past 3 days.

03:25.680 --> 03:27.580
P.S., you're glowing.

03:27.640 --> 03:28.610
Any connection?

03:28.680 --> 03:31.210
Let's just say everything's fine.

03:33.540 --> 03:36.040
Excuse me,sir. You dropped your hat.

03:36.110 --> 03:37.210
I didn't realize...

03:37.280 --> 03:39.880
Eli. Knew it.

03:39.940 --> 03:43.440
Hey,look, they invited the whole faculty, ok?

03:43.510 --> 03:45.280
And my mom's a big fan,

03:45.340 --> 03:47.410
So I thought I'd come down and get an autograph.

03:47.480 --> 03:48.580
Yeah, mm-hmm.

03:48.640 --> 03:51.010
For her. Not for me.

03:51.080 --> 03:53.280
I'm not the only one. See?

03:54.110 --> 03:56.110
Hi-ho,everyone.

03:56.310 --> 03:57.740
I'm Duff Faraday.

03:57.810 --> 03:59.580
And as first assistant director on the show,

03:59.640 --> 04:01.210
It's my job to keep things moving along,

04:01.280 --> 04:04.440
so welcome to an evening with Hope's Edge.

04:05.080 --> 04:08.680
First of all,let's say hello to our exec producer,

04:08.740 --> 04:11.440
creator,head writer, and frequent director,

04:11.510 --> 04:13.640
And, yes, they are all the same person.

04:13.710 --> 04:14.710
Cally O'Keefe!

04:19.110 --> 04:21.010
Thank you, Grandview.

04:21.079 --> 04:23.240
It's a pleasure to be here. I'm...

04:23.310 --> 04:24.910
Oh ho ho. Yes. Yes.

04:24.980 --> 04:26.840
And next up, here they are,

04:26.910 --> 04:28.780
Daytime's dynamic duo.

04:28.840 --> 04:31.010
And, yes, we are introducing them together,

04:31.080 --> 04:32.610
because...whew... wouldn't wanna

04:32.680 --> 04:34.680
Start a fight between these two.

04:35.540 --> 04:36.910
Here they are,

04:36.980 --> 04:39.610
Dr. Troy Holden and Celeste Barrington.

04:39.680 --> 04:42.640
Say hello to Suzanne Zale and Grant Harper!

04:48.640 --> 04:50.480
You see that?

04:50.540 --> 04:51.740
They love me.

04:51.810 --> 04:53.080
Love to hate you, you mean.

04:55.410 --> 04:56.780
Thank you,Duff.

04:56.840 --> 04:59.110
This is such a treat for us.

04:59.180 --> 05:01.180
You know, I actually discovered Grant

05:01.240 --> 05:03.610
right here on this stage when he auditioned

05:03.680 --> 05:06.240
for my first play way back in grad school.

05:08.110 --> 05:10.280
Don't you mean your only play?

05:14.540 --> 05:17.110
So this is an honor for us.

05:17.180 --> 05:18.240
Sorry I'm late.

05:18.310 --> 05:19.540
I was indisposed.

05:19.610 --> 05:21.540
Before we show you highlights from the past

05:21.610 --> 05:23.380
10 seasons of Hope's Edge,

05:23.440 --> 05:25.940
I would like to open things up for your questions.

05:26.010 --> 05:27.640
Oh, this ought to be good.

05:28.880 --> 05:30.480
Yes.

05:30.540 --> 05:32.880
Hi. My name's Janet,

05:32.940 --> 05:34.840
and I'm president of the Grandview chapter

05:34.910 --> 05:36.880
of the Hope's Edge fan club.

05:36.940 --> 05:39.140
And I don't mean to be disrespectful,

05:39.210 --> 05:40.710
but what were you and your writers thinking

05:40.780 --> 05:42.610
when you decided to ruin the character of Dr. Holden?

05:44.780 --> 05:46.340
Excellent question,cal.

05:46.410 --> 05:48.280
That's the whole brain-tumor, blackout thing.

05:48.340 --> 05:48.880
Got it.

05:48.940 --> 05:50.110
To tell you the truth,

05:50.180 --> 05:54.010
after the last 10 years of Dr. Holden being so flawless,

05:54.080 --> 05:56.710
sometimes to keep a story fresh,

05:56.780 --> 05:58.180
you have to take some risks.

05:58.240 --> 06:00.275
And now spoilerfest.com says

06:00.275 --> 06:02.110
you're gonna kill him off for good

06:02.180 --> 06:03.380
Is that true?

06:03.640 --> 06:05.240
Is Grant Harper leaving the show?

06:05.310 --> 06:06.580
- What? - No way.

06:06.640 --> 06:10.210
Look, I don't wanna be confirming or denying rumors...

06:10.210 --> 06:11.280
But I will say,

06:11.340 --> 06:13.480
In TV, there are a lot of reasons

06:13.540 --> 06:15.580
you might have to write a character out...

06:15.640 --> 06:18.080
A salary dispute, an actor breaks out

06:18.140 --> 06:20.080
and the network wants to give them their own series,

06:20.140 --> 06:25.580
or sometimes the actor just wants a change.

06:25.640 --> 06:29.180
And in any of those circumstances,

06:29.240 --> 06:31.510
you might have to kill the actor.

06:31.580 --> 06:33.910
Well, you guys know a thing or two about that.

06:36.980 --> 06:39.440
Ok, ok, we were gonna save this for the end,

06:39.510 --> 06:41.680
but, uh, look on the back of your programs.

06:41.740 --> 06:43.540
There's a form where you can enter a contest

06:43.610 --> 06:47.280
To win a walk-on part on our 10th anniversary special.

06:47.340 --> 06:48.640
No,here. Wait, I wanna do it!

06:48.710 --> 06:50.240
A part in the show. No way.

06:50.310 --> 06:52.010
You guys check that out, and we'll, uh, roll the video.

06:52.080 --> 06:52.660
Thank you.

06:53.700 --> 06:58.240
Rolling, any second now. Video.

07:01.480 --> 07:04.410
We got a surprise guest.

07:06.010 --> 07:08.540
Players are in place.

07:09.380 --> 07:11.010
Stage is set.

07:11.010 --> 07:14.010
Just no video? Tell you why. You...

07:16.222 --> 07:17.916
- What's wrong with the lights? - What's with the lights?

07:18.316 --> 07:20.010
Guys, guys

07:20.080 --> 07:21.680
Just a moment, ladies and gentlemen.

07:21.740 --> 07:24.780
We're experiencing some technical difficulties.

07:29.740 --> 07:31.910
And now someone's gonna go out with a bang.

07:33.000 --> 07:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:05.180 --> 08:06.840
There you go.

08:08.410 --> 08:10.610
It was definitely a warning.

08:10.610 --> 08:11.870
Something about killing actors?

08:11.940 --> 08:14.810
Wait. The ghost wants to hurt someone?

08:14.870 --> 08:15.970
On the show?

08:16.000 --> 08:18.030
Because we cannot let that happen.

08:18.100 --> 08:19.200
Obviously.

08:19.270 --> 08:21.770
Uh, any clue as to the woman in the spotlight?

08:21.830 --> 08:23.370
I didn't get a look at her,but

08:23.430 --> 08:24.970
I'm happy to dive right in on this one.

08:25.230 --> 08:27.230
And so you can go hang out with the cast and crew.

08:27.300 --> 08:28.730
You can count me in.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.530
Guys, please remember that we don't know

08:30.600 --> 08:32.429
if we're dealing with a murder or a suicide here.

08:32.500 --> 08:34.100
I mean, the guy was shot in the head.

08:34.169 --> 08:36.000
Ok. Was he cute?

08:36.070 --> 08:37.600
Well, did he look famous?

08:37.669 --> 08:40.030
Do you think he could have ever been on the show?

08:40.900 --> 08:42.130
That's him.

08:43.570 --> 08:45.030
Miles Maitland.

08:45.100 --> 08:47.470
The guy who the theater's named after?

08:47.530 --> 08:49.770
Yeah,1975 to 1997.

08:49.830 --> 08:51.470
He was a grad student in the acting program.

08:51.530 --> 08:53.230
said he had a promising future.

08:53.300 --> 08:55.600
until they robbed me.

08:55.670 --> 08:57.330
We can help you. What happened?

08:57.400 --> 08:58.670
Ask them.

09:01.170 --> 09:04.370
Uh, what's going on?

09:04.430 --> 09:07.030
He's blaming someone from the show for his death.

09:07.100 --> 09:09.670
What is this guy's connection to hope's edge?

09:09.730 --> 09:12.400
You know,Cally just said that she met Grant

09:12.470 --> 09:13.930
here when she was in grad school.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.400
Maybe they knew him from back then.

09:19.530 --> 09:21.030
So we're going to need to redress that counter,

09:21.100 --> 09:23.030
and I want books everywhere.

09:23.100 --> 09:26.630
Oh, and I'm going to need to swap out those shelves for red ones.

09:26.700 --> 09:27.900
We'll put them back, of course.

09:27.970 --> 09:29.570
Oh, it's no problem. Whatever you need.

09:30.270 --> 09:32.129
Could we also check the lighting over here?

09:32.130 --> 09:33.700
Why did they rent the store

09:33.700 --> 09:35.270
if they just keep changing everything?

09:35.330 --> 09:38.070
Well, it's supposed to be some kind of antique store

09:38.130 --> 09:39.430
that specializes in the occult.

09:39.500 --> 09:41.000
Ooh, that sounds juicy. I swear,

09:41.070 --> 09:44.530
Hope's Edge is the best show on TV, really.

09:46.270 --> 09:47.385
You really want that walk-on part,

09:47.385 --> 09:48.500
don't you, Mr. Suit and Tie?

09:48.570 --> 09:50.530
No more than you, Missy Brand-new 'do.

09:50.600 --> 09:52.900
You know what? Let's just focus on the task at hand.

09:52.970 --> 09:54.430
We have a ghost to cross over.

09:54.500 --> 09:56.330
Fine.

09:58.200 --> 10:00.200
Ok,here we go,

10:00.270 --> 10:01.670
From April,'97.

10:01.730 --> 10:03.800
"Rockland University student Miles Maitland, 22,

10:03.870 --> 10:05.770
"was shot and killed onstage in front of

10:05.830 --> 10:08.200
"an audience of 300 theatergoers Friday night

10:08.270 --> 10:10.370
"during the performance of the comedy play Dead to Me."

10:10.700 --> 10:12.270
Shot and killed onstage?

10:12.330 --> 10:13.270
Yeah.

10:13.330 --> 10:14.800
And guess who wrote the play?

10:16.800 --> 10:18.470
Cally O'Keefe.

10:18.530 --> 10:19.700
It gets worse.

10:19.770 --> 10:21.130
Guess who played the lead.

10:22.130 --> 10:25.000
Grant Harper. That's our connection.

10:25.070 --> 10:28.330
It says a blank gun fired and malfunctioned

10:28.330 --> 10:33.330
and killed Miles early in the second act of the show, and...

10:33.400 --> 10:34.570
What?

10:35.900 --> 10:38.500
The actress who shot him was Brook Dennis.

10:39.670 --> 10:40.700
Should I know that name?

10:40.770 --> 10:43.030
No, but she's a theater professor here at Rockland.

10:43.100 --> 10:45.600
I've never met her, but I've read all about her productions.

10:45.670 --> 10:47.300
Well, why don't we go and talk to her?

10:47.370 --> 10:49.770
After I do a little fact-finding with the police.

10:50.970 --> 10:52.970
Ok, according to the police,

10:53.030 --> 10:55.270
the gun was an old snub-nosed revolver

10:55.330 --> 10:57.730
that had been in the theater prop department for years.

10:57.800 --> 10:58.800
Now, detective Blair told me

10:58.870 --> 11:00.570
that the barrel was corroded

11:00.630 --> 11:03.630
and that the blank had some extra powder in it,

11:03.700 --> 11:05.670
so at close range, the wadding could have launched,

11:05.730 --> 11:06.770
caused some serious damage.

11:06.830 --> 11:08.170
By which you mean death.

11:08.230 --> 11:09.170
Think about it.

11:09.230 --> 11:11.470
You gun someone down in front of 300 witnesses,

11:11.530 --> 11:13.170
make it look like a tragic accident.

11:13.230 --> 11:14.530
It's the perfect murder.

11:18.730 --> 11:19.900
Brook Dennis.

11:19.970 --> 11:21.100
Our shooter.

11:21.170 --> 11:23.100
"Our shooter." Don't you mean actor?

11:23.170 --> 11:26.270
Wasn't this the woman in the spotlight last night?

11:26.330 --> 11:28.400
Yeah. Was she even charged?

11:28.470 --> 11:30.000
Well,Miles' death was considered an accident.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.170
They never found any motive.

11:32.230 --> 11:33.600
But there were 3 people in the play...

11:33.670 --> 11:36.270
Miles,Brook, and Grant Harper...

11:36.330 --> 11:37.500
Plus Cally, who wrote and directed,

11:37.570 --> 11:39.370
And all their fingerprints were found on the gun.

11:39.430 --> 11:41.430
So anyone could have tampered with it.

11:41.430 --> 11:42.630
Or everyone.

11:43.930 --> 11:46.070
You don't think that...

11:46.930 --> 11:47.870
Conspiracy?

11:47.930 --> 11:48.930
To commit murder.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.870
So 3 people conspired together

11:51.930 --> 11:54.930
on a diabolically goofy plan to kill a guy

11:55.000 --> 11:56.300
in front of hundreds of people for no reason?

11:56.370 --> 11:58.900
Yeah, ok, it sounds a little far-fetched,

11:58.970 --> 12:01.600
but the ghost obviously blames them all.

12:01.670 --> 12:04.500
Otherwise, why would he point a spotlight at all of 'em?

12:04.570 --> 12:05.770
I don't know.

12:05.830 --> 12:07.570
But I also don't know why he would wait so long.

12:07.630 --> 12:08.830
He died 10 years ago.

12:08.900 --> 12:10.500
Well, maybe that little reunion onstage woke him up.

12:10.570 --> 12:12.170
I mean, maybe he was haunting the theater.

12:12.230 --> 12:13.270
Or Brook, who worked there

12:13.530 --> 12:15.600
and happened to pull the trigger.

12:15.670 --> 12:18.600
Maybe the conspiracy is a conspiracy of silence.

12:18.670 --> 12:19.870
Brook killed Miles,

12:19.930 --> 12:21.600
Whether on purpose or by accident.

12:21.600 --> 12:23.830
The other two know why, but kept quiet.

12:24.930 --> 12:27.170
Unless that's too goofy a theory for you.

12:27.230 --> 12:31.330
No. Actually, that one, I'd believe.

13:01.870 --> 13:03.830
No,Celeste. You'll be fine.

13:03.900 --> 13:06.370
It's our relationship that's not gonna make it.

13:07.130 --> 13:09.000
You can't mean that.

13:09.770 --> 13:10.930
Doesn't change the fact

13:11.000 --> 13:12.370
That you slept with my father.

13:12.430 --> 13:14.070
So what? So you're cutting me out of your life?

13:14.130 --> 13:16.230
Of course I hid your child from you.

13:16.300 --> 13:17.500
I did it because I lov...

13:17.570 --> 13:20.370
So what are you sayin'? This was good-bye sex?

13:22.470 --> 13:23.400
Why?!

13:23.900 --> 13:24.970
Why?!

13:26.470 --> 13:28.500
How quickly love turns to hate.

13:28.570 --> 13:29.900
How quickly love turns to hate.

13:29.970 --> 13:32.500
How quickly love turns to hate.

13:32.530 --> 13:34.670
Well, I know you by reputation around campus,

13:34.730 --> 13:36.030
Professor James.

13:36.300 --> 13:38.670
Oh. Well, please call me Eli,

13:38.730 --> 13:40.930
And I hope that's a good thing.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.570
Mostly.

13:42.630 --> 13:45.270
Um, would you like to sit down?

13:45.330 --> 13:46.870
- Let me move this.  - I got it. I got it.

13:46.930 --> 13:49.530
Oh, thanks. Just put it by the door for the recyclers.

13:51.500 --> 13:53.470
Is it broken?

13:53.530 --> 13:55.630
Uh, possessed is more like it.

13:59.470 --> 14:03.230
Heh. You guys are gonna think I'm nuts.

14:03.300 --> 14:06.830
We might not, uh...

14:06.900 --> 14:07.830
So what happened?

14:07.900 --> 14:10.430
Well,first it turned itself on,

14:10.500 --> 14:12.970
and then it just started flipping through scenes

14:13.030 --> 14:14.870
from that soap opera that's shooting in town.

14:14.930 --> 14:16.170
What scenes? Do you remember?

14:16.230 --> 14:18.070
Uh,just the 2 main characters

14:18.130 --> 14:20.130
breaking up over and over again.

14:21.070 --> 14:22.500
Anyway, I'm sure that you didn't

14:22.570 --> 14:24.000
come here to talk about my television.

14:24.070 --> 14:27.100
What did you want to see me about?

14:28.500 --> 14:30.530
Uh,Miles Maitland.

14:30.600 --> 14:31.530
What about him?

14:31.600 --> 14:33.770
You may find this hard to believe...

14:34.830 --> 14:37.130
But we think that Miles is haunting you.

14:38.770 --> 14:40.870
We've talked to his spirit.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.330
You talk to ghosts?

14:43.500 --> 14:45.570
And I can see them.

14:45.630 --> 14:48.170
Look, you have to believe us,OK,

14:48.230 --> 14:51.330
because we've seen Miles and your TV,

14:51.400 --> 14:53.300
and this could be just the beginning.

14:53.370 --> 14:55.930
Yeah, that's really strange.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.670
Because ever since Grant and Cally have been back in town...

15:01.000 --> 15:02.630
I felt Miles was here.

15:02.700 --> 15:05.370
But, you know, I...I just thought it was his memory.

15:05.430 --> 15:07.930
Do you remember what happened the night Miles died?

15:08.000 --> 15:09.330
How could I forget? I...

15:09.400 --> 15:11.730
I shot him.

15:11.800 --> 15:15.030
Sorry,babe,but if you're asking me to beg for my life...

15:15.100 --> 15:16.670
All I'm asking is that you

15:16.730 --> 15:18.800
don't get blood on my new berber.

15:23.530 --> 15:25.230
What happened after you shot him?

15:25.300 --> 15:29.930
Um, well,Grant and I, we finished the scene like always.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.900
Miles used to complain that he had to lie perfectly still

15:32.970 --> 15:35.800
throughout the entire second act.

15:36.870 --> 15:41.770
Anyway, uh, we didn't know Miles was dead until curtain.

15:53.700 --> 15:55.800
Call 9-1-1! Close the curtain!

15:55.870 --> 15:57.730
Miles! Miles.

15:57.800 --> 16:00.330
He must have been dead or dying

16:00.400 --> 16:03.500
for at least 30 minutes.

16:04.930 --> 16:07.900
I always wondered if he heard them laughing the whole time.

16:07.970 --> 16:10.670
You said he was shot in the side, not the head?

16:10.730 --> 16:13.600
When I saw him, he had a bullet wound to the temple.

16:13.670 --> 16:15.770
Oh, yeah, yeah. The makeup. Of course.

16:15.830 --> 16:19.000
Um, the trick was that he would play part of the scene in profile,

16:19.070 --> 16:22.630
And when I shot him, he would turn to reveal the wound.

16:24.400 --> 16:26.830
You know, it always got a really big reaction.

16:27.800 --> 16:29.300
Listen, I'm sorry,

16:29.370 --> 16:32.230
But, uh, this is really hard for me to talk about.

16:32.300 --> 16:33.500
You know?

16:34.270 --> 16:36.230
The gun firing like that...

16:36.300 --> 16:38.000
And it was a bad night to begin with.

16:38.070 --> 16:39.170
What do you mean?

16:39.230 --> 16:42.170
Some producers made a deal with Cally

16:42.230 --> 16:44.470
to take the play to the city.

16:44.530 --> 16:46.870
I'm sorry. I fought for you.

16:46.900 --> 16:48.430
It was gonna be everyone's big break.

16:48.500 --> 16:49.500
Let's just finish the show.

16:49.570 --> 16:51.170
But Grant heard a rumor that

16:51.170 --> 16:52.770
Miles was replacing him as the lead,

16:52.830 --> 16:54.770
So he confronted Cally about it at intermission,

16:54.830 --> 16:57.970
And she had no choice. She had to tell him the truth.

16:58.030 --> 17:00.970
You can use this anger for a future role.

17:01.030 --> 17:03.730
And Miles,he wasn't the most gracious winner,

17:03.800 --> 17:06.670
So when we went back onstage,he...

17:06.730 --> 17:10.500
started ad-libbing lines and changing the blocking

17:10.500 --> 17:14.569
and just really trying to rub it in Grant's face.

17:16.170 --> 17:18.700
It was heartbreaking.

17:20.230 --> 17:23.829
You seem pretty protective of him.

17:23.900 --> 17:25.130
Grant, I mean.

17:25.200 --> 17:27.369
Yeah, I was.

17:27.430 --> 17:30.000
You see, we...we'd been dating,Grant and I.

17:30.070 --> 17:33.170
But something changed when we both got cast in the show,

17:33.230 --> 17:34.700
and we broke up.

17:35.570 --> 17:40.070
You know, I was pretty sure that he was having a thing with Cally.

17:41.770 --> 17:43.930
Of course, after Miles was killed,

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
the play never went to the city,

17:46.070 --> 17:49.300
And Cally took a job writing for a soap in l.A.

17:49.370 --> 17:51.730
Within the year, she had created Hope's Edge,

17:51.800 --> 17:53.730
and she brought Grant onboard.

17:53.800 --> 17:56.430
And everyone lived happily ever after.

17:56.500 --> 17:58.300
Well, who knows?

17:58.370 --> 18:01.900
I think we all carry that night with us.

18:01.970 --> 18:03.570
I know I do.

18:07.670 --> 18:08.730
I think she's lying.

18:08.800 --> 18:10.100
Well, then she's a good liar.

18:10.170 --> 18:12.230
Of course she's a good liar. She's an actress.

18:12.300 --> 18:14.370
Ok,so then if he thinks it wasn't an accident,

18:14.430 --> 18:16.070
why is he showing her scenes from the show,

18:16.130 --> 18:18.200
and what is it that he's trying to tell her?

18:18.270 --> 18:19.400
"Hello. I know you killed me."

18:19.470 --> 18:21.400
Plus those scenes were with Grant Harper.

18:21.400 --> 18:22.370
That's what she said, right?

18:22.370 --> 18:24.130
Maybe Miles thinks they were in it together.

18:24.200 --> 18:26.000
Right,so then why isn't he haunting Grant,

18:26.070 --> 18:29.270
and why isn't he here telling us that we need to call the police?

18:29.330 --> 18:30.930
Well, the police couldn't find any proof.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.070
Miles is getting justice the only way he knows how.

18:33.130 --> 18:34.830
That doesn't make any sense to me.

18:34.900 --> 18:36.700
Where are you going?

18:36.770 --> 18:38.900
Watch TV.

18:40.800 --> 18:42.030
Troy,listen to me.

18:42.100 --> 18:44.830
He told me just before he lost consciousness.

18:44.900 --> 18:46.430
He said that he was happy.

18:47.700 --> 18:49.200
We are gonna get through this.

18:49.500 --> 18:51.830
Hey. What a nice surprise.

18:51.900 --> 18:53.270
What are you doing home?

18:53.330 --> 18:55.600
Oh... I think the ghost

18:55.670 --> 18:58.200
is using scenes from the show to try and send a message,

18:58.200 --> 18:59.870
so I'm watching old episodes.

18:59.930 --> 19:01.900
Plus they're shooting at the store. It's closed.

19:01.970 --> 19:02.930
Oh, you got a cold?

19:03.000 --> 19:04.100
What's going on? What...

19:04.170 --> 19:06.800
Wait a minute. Are you crying?

19:06.870 --> 19:09.570
Uhh. I kinda got sucked in, ok?

19:09.630 --> 19:11.470
There's so much sadness and loss.

19:12.500 --> 19:13.900
That's great. I love it.

19:15.900 --> 19:19.370
This is the episode where Dr. Holden's father is on his deathbed

19:19.430 --> 19:21.570
and Celeste Barrington doesn't even let him know.

19:21.630 --> 19:23.030
Until after his father's died.

19:23.100 --> 19:24.930
And now Dr. Holden will never know

19:25.000 --> 19:26.970
who his real mother is.

19:27.030 --> 19:29.900
You're right. It's addictive.

19:29.970 --> 19:32.830
Wait a minute. So the... the ghost is using this soap somehow?

19:32.900 --> 19:34.830
Yeah. He's trying to tell Brook Dennis something.

19:34.900 --> 19:37.470
I take it that Grant harper and Suzanne Zale's characters,

19:37.530 --> 19:38.730
They break up a lot?

19:38.800 --> 19:39.630
On,constantly. Oh, yeah, yeah.

19:39.700 --> 19:40.830
They're like bitter enemies

19:40.900 --> 19:42.430
that can't get enough of each other, you know?

19:42.500 --> 19:44.430
If she ever knew how many women who've thrown themselves at his feet,

19:44.500 --> 19:46.630
And if he ever knew how she keeps him under her thumb,eh...

19:46.700 --> 19:48.930
- But why?  - I don't know.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
She's a control freak,

19:50.020 --> 19:51.580
And he's afraid to go after his dreams,

19:51.580 --> 19:53.250
But they love each other.

19:53.320 --> 19:54.350
It's entertaining.

19:54.420 --> 19:55.250
Wait. Ooh. Oh.

19:55.320 --> 19:57.520
Here's a link to today's episode.

19:57.580 --> 19:59.850
Ahh! I'll make popcorn.

20:03.120 --> 20:04.080
Camera.

20:04.150 --> 20:05.520
Action!

20:07.280 --> 20:11.320
Dr. Holden, if the board finds out what you've been up to...

20:11.380 --> 20:12.980
The only thing the board is gonna find out now is the truth,

20:13.050 --> 20:15.020
that you've been lying to them for the past 8 years.

20:15.080 --> 20:16.620
Cut it! Cut!

20:16.680 --> 20:17.780
- It was perfect.  - What the hell? What's go...

20:17.850 --> 20:19.080
We got looky-loos.

20:19.150 --> 20:21.150
Duff! Please.

20:22.120 --> 20:23.880
Sorry,folks. You're in the shot.

20:23.950 --> 20:26.180
Oops. I'm sorry.

20:26.250 --> 20:27.950
It won't happen again. Ok.

20:28.020 --> 20:29.850
Setting back to one!

20:30.850 --> 20:33.150
That was so embarrassing.

20:33.220 --> 20:34.880
I wonder what they're shooting.

20:34.950 --> 20:36.850
You really wanna know?

20:37.950 --> 20:39.580
Come on, come on.

20:39.680 --> 20:42.020
Go. Go.

20:42.080 --> 20:44.700
Ok,so I found this little script.

20:44.700 --> 20:46.600
It has all the pages that they're shooting today.

20:46.670 --> 20:47.900
I guess they call them sides.

20:47.970 --> 20:49.030
Well, all I know... uh-huh.

20:49.100 --> 20:50.230
Is the rumors are true.

20:52.470 --> 20:53.830
Well, are you gonna tell me or not?

20:55.130 --> 20:58.530
There's a confidentiality clause on the location agreement.

20:58.600 --> 21:00.370
They're trying to keep the story under wraps.

21:00.430 --> 21:01.370
Aw, come on.

21:01.430 --> 21:04.000
But if I were just to maybe...

21:04.070 --> 21:05.470
drop these...

21:05.530 --> 21:09.170
And I were just to pick them up...

21:13.800 --> 21:14.370
Holy cow.

21:14.430 --> 21:15.670
They're really gonna kill Dr. Holden.

21:15.730 --> 21:17.200
- Yeah.  - Why?

21:17.270 --> 21:20.100
Because apparently the real drama is behind the camera.

21:20.170 --> 21:22.830
Look. It seems...

21:22.900 --> 21:24.870
that Grant Holden is having a torrid love affair

21:24.930 --> 21:25.970
with one of his co-stars,

21:26.030 --> 21:27.670
- And that's coming to an end.  - Suzanne Zale.

21:27.730 --> 21:28.970
Well, they didn't say,

21:29.030 --> 21:31.400
But rumor has it that's why he's leaving the show.

21:31.470 --> 21:33.570
Wait till they find out he might be a murderer.

21:33.630 --> 21:35.600
Come on. You really think

21:35.670 --> 21:37.930
Grant had something to do with Miles' death?

21:38.000 --> 21:39.470
Yeah, I think it's possible.

21:39.530 --> 21:41.630
According to the police file, Grant took the prop gun home

21:41.700 --> 21:44.430
the night before Miles was shot.

21:44.500 --> 21:47.100
He said he was using it to rehearse a scene for a movie audition.

21:47.170 --> 21:49.400
You really think he was rigging it

21:49.470 --> 21:51.900
to kill Miles when Brook pulled the trigger?

21:51.970 --> 21:53.800
And...action!

21:57.170 --> 21:58.600
I think the ghost may think that.

21:58.670 --> 21:59.970
Shut it.

22:00.030 --> 22:02.570
Which is why he said, "somebody's going out with a bang."

22:02.630 --> 22:03.830
I won't let you do this.

22:03.900 --> 22:06.030
I won't let you leave me.

22:06.100 --> 22:09.270
Wait a minute. Celeste is about to shoot Dr. Holden...

22:09.330 --> 22:11.530
Celeste, how do you think you can stop me?

22:11.600 --> 22:13.000
With a prop gun?!

22:14.870 --> 22:16.500
...where you are.

22:16.570 --> 22:17.500
Cut! Cut! What the...

22:17.570 --> 22:18.670
Security!

22:18.730 --> 22:20.100
- Hey, security!  -What's going on? Get off me.

22:20.170 --> 22:21.400
Get off, man! Come on!

22:21.470 --> 22:22.400
Grant, you ok?

22:22.470 --> 22:23.600
She was gonna shoot him.

22:23.670 --> 22:26.830
It's a TV show. It's pretend. You idiot!

22:28.000 --> 22:29.500
Grant, are you all right?

22:29.570 --> 22:32.600
You should have let her shoot him.

22:35.700 --> 22:36.870
You wanna press charges?

22:36.930 --> 22:39.270
No, but keep that lunatic away from me.

22:39.330 --> 22:41.200
Duff, I'll be in my trailer.

22:42.830 --> 22:45.430
I thought the ghost was trying to kill Grant

22:45.500 --> 22:47.230
the same way he was killed.

22:47.300 --> 22:48.800
It was a good theory.

22:48.870 --> 22:50.430
They should be thanking me.

22:50.500 --> 22:53.870
Instead, I just ruined my chances of getting that walk-on part.

22:53.930 --> 22:55.100
It was a good theory,

22:55.170 --> 22:56.570
except nobody tampered with the gun.

22:56.630 --> 22:57.570
But the ghost was here.

22:57.630 --> 22:59.370
He said I should have let her shoot him.

22:59.430 --> 23:02.430
Can ghosts make blank guns fire real bullets?

23:02.500 --> 23:05.200
Something tells me he doesn't wanna kill anybody.

23:05.270 --> 23:06.170
Why do you say that?

23:06.230 --> 23:08.230
Nobody's dead.

23:09.100 --> 23:10.370
Yet!

23:10.430 --> 23:12.370
Hair and makeup needs a half-an-hour to fix Grant,

23:12.430 --> 23:14.530
plus whatever time he needs to recuperate.

23:14.600 --> 23:16.330
Let's shoot Suzanne's close-up.

23:16.400 --> 23:18.300
This episode is cursed.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.630
Excuse me. I-I'm sorry about my friend.

23:22.900 --> 23:24.100
He can get excitable.

23:24.170 --> 23:25.770
Yeah, well, it's in pretty bad taste

23:25.830 --> 23:28.600
to be bringing up malfunctioning blank guns around us.

23:28.670 --> 23:30.470
Because of Miles Maitland. We know.

23:30.530 --> 23:33.070
What is this about? Really.

23:33.130 --> 23:35.000
Look, I know it's gonna sound strange,

23:35.070 --> 23:37.670
But do you remember the other night at the theater

23:37.730 --> 23:39.270
when all the lights went haywire?

23:39.330 --> 23:40.270
What about it?

23:40.330 --> 23:41.200
That was Miles.

23:41.270 --> 23:43.500
He's angry, and I think he blames

23:43.570 --> 23:45.370
one of you for his death.

23:45.430 --> 23:47.730
Look, I know that it's hard to believe,

23:47.800 --> 23:49.130
but I have a gift.

23:49.200 --> 23:52.830
I've seen Miles, and I've talked to him.

23:54.130 --> 23:56.900
Since he died, has anything strange happened to you?

23:56.970 --> 24:00.700
Anything that's made you feel like maybe Miles was with you?

24:01.700 --> 24:03.900
I've never told anyone that before.

24:05.030 --> 24:08.400
So you're saying that his ghost is really...

24:08.470 --> 24:09.600
Haunting you.

24:09.670 --> 24:12.900
I'm just not sure why or for how long,

24:12.970 --> 24:14.670
But he's still here.

24:15.530 --> 24:16.500
Is he here right now?

24:16.570 --> 24:17.930
Not at the moment.

24:20.770 --> 24:23.430
You two were close?

24:23.500 --> 24:25.130
We met as undergrads.

24:25.200 --> 24:27.930
Miles would read whatever I was working on.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.370
And give me notes, lots of notes.

24:30.430 --> 24:32.370
Like on Dead to Me?

24:32.430 --> 24:35.300
He fought me constantly during those rehearsals.

24:35.370 --> 24:37.700
He was obsessed with truth, even in a bedroom farce.

24:37.770 --> 24:39.870
That's when I felt like killing him.

24:39.930 --> 24:43.300
But the thing is, all his notes just made the work better.

24:45.670 --> 24:49.570
Anyway, whenever I face that blinking cursor,

24:49.630 --> 24:52.570
it's like he's still there challenging me.

24:54.470 --> 24:56.300
I know that must sound crazy.

24:56.370 --> 24:58.570
Oh. Consider who you're talking to.

24:58.630 --> 25:01.830
He thinks we had something to do with his death?

25:01.900 --> 25:04.330
That's crazy.

25:05.200 --> 25:08.170
The irony is that play never would've gone anywhere without him.

25:08.230 --> 25:10.300
As it turns out, it didn't.

25:10.370 --> 25:12.900
Sounds like you regret that.

25:14.530 --> 25:16.270
Regret?

25:16.330 --> 25:18.300
Who knows?

25:18.370 --> 25:20.630
Things worked out pretty well for us.

25:20.700 --> 25:22.630
You and Grant, you mean.

25:22.700 --> 25:24.900
Sure, he got his ego bruised,

25:24.970 --> 25:27.630
But he knew I'd look out for him.

25:27.700 --> 25:29.800
I always look out for my friends.

25:29.870 --> 25:33.070
Trouble is she has a not-so-friendly way of doing it.

25:34.300 --> 25:37.530
So I'm... I'm guessing that you and Grant...

25:40.500 --> 25:42.200
Why have you kept it a secret?

25:42.270 --> 25:45.100
I'll deny it if you ever tell anyone,

25:45.170 --> 25:48.870
but the truth is it's better for his image to be single,

25:48.930 --> 25:50.430
and I like my privacy.

25:50.500 --> 25:52.400
Then why are you writing him off the show?

25:52.470 --> 25:54.700
Look, we get ratings when he leaves,

25:54.770 --> 25:56.670
even more when he comes back,

25:56.730 --> 25:59.500
And every now and then, he needs his freedom,

25:59.520 --> 26:02.200
but he always comes back to the show

26:02.270 --> 26:03.530
and to the character.

26:03.600 --> 26:06.270
And to you.

26:08.730 --> 26:09.670
Sorry. I just...

26:09.730 --> 26:10.970
I get these chills.

26:11.030 --> 26:13.370
It's like a low blood sugar thing.

26:13.430 --> 26:14.830
No. Actually, it was Miles.

26:14.900 --> 26:17.630
He got really upset, and I don't know why.

26:17.700 --> 26:19.870
Well, good luck figuring him out.

26:19.930 --> 26:21.570
I never could.

26:21.630 --> 26:23.370
I'm still confused.

26:23.430 --> 26:26.770
So you're killing Grant's character off your show.

26:26.830 --> 26:29.170
Cally! They're ready for you on the set.

26:30.570 --> 26:34.170
Do you catch much TV or movies or books, for that matter?

26:34.230 --> 26:36.530
People in fiction don't always stay dead.

26:38.230 --> 26:40.870
What the hell?

26:42.070 --> 26:44.330
Like I said, cursed.

26:45.400 --> 26:47.870
But I love the thought of working with you again.

26:48.230 --> 26:51.100
Grant, you would actually consider it?

26:51.170 --> 26:52.300
Of course I would.

26:52.370 --> 26:54.930
And I'm a free man after today.

26:55.200 --> 26:56.300
Duff, where's Grant?

26:56.370 --> 26:57.570
Uh, he's in his trailer.

26:57.630 --> 26:59.100
We'll be ready in 5 for Suzanne's close-up.

26:59.170 --> 27:00.330
I'll be right back.

27:00.500 --> 27:02.900
When I heard the show was coming to Grandview,

27:02.970 --> 27:04.530
This is what I hoped for.

27:04.600 --> 27:07.230
What? The teaching job?

27:07.300 --> 27:09.000
No. Just...

27:11.000 --> 27:12.270
Oh. Sorry.

27:13.170 --> 27:15.400
Brook, what a surprise.

27:15.470 --> 27:16.930
Hi, Cally.

27:18.430 --> 27:20.470
Grant, I just wanted to let you know

27:20.530 --> 27:21.600
that your body Mike is on,

27:21.670 --> 27:24.770
so if you two were discussing anything private...

27:24.830 --> 27:27.670
Not at all. I was just talking to Brook about the possibility

27:27.730 --> 27:29.500
of teaching when I'm done with the show.

27:29.570 --> 27:30.770
Teaching?

27:30.830 --> 27:32.230
At Rockland?

27:32.300 --> 27:36.400
Yeah. The department chair suggested an artist in residence.

27:36.470 --> 27:39.000
Well, congratulations.

27:39.070 --> 27:40.670
Omn I hate to interrupt,

27:41.730 --> 27:44.330
But we need you in hair and makeup, so...

27:44.400 --> 27:45.870
Really good to see you, Brook.

27:47.930 --> 27:49.230
Sorry. I've gotta get back to work.

27:49.530 --> 27:50.600
- Of course.  - Duff!

27:50.670 --> 27:51.500
I'll be in my trailer!

27:52.170 --> 27:53.530
You finish the scene, please!

27:53.600 --> 27:54.500
Action!

27:54.570 --> 27:56.300
I won't let you do that.

27:56.370 --> 27:57.670
I won't let you leave me.

27:57.730 --> 28:00.070
Celeste, how do you think you can stop me?

28:00.130 --> 28:01.330
Easily.

28:01.400 --> 28:04.470
At least this way, I'll always know where you are.

28:07.630 --> 28:10.670
Waiting for you... in hell.

28:12.100 --> 28:13.970
And cut!

28:14.030 --> 28:16.330
Yeah. Ladies and gentlemen,

28:16.400 --> 28:20.270
that's the series wrap for Grant Harper.

28:20.330 --> 28:21.500
Good job.

28:23.170 --> 28:24.730
Nice job.

28:26.100 --> 28:28.230
Thank you, everybody. Enjoyed it.

28:29.970 --> 28:31.770
You guys are the best. Thank you.

28:34.770 --> 28:35.670
What?

28:35.730 --> 28:38.100
I'm gonna miss him.

28:45.970 --> 28:47.300
Goldenrod pages.

28:47.370 --> 28:50.630
Old habits, I know, but I just wrapped. I'm done.

28:50.700 --> 28:54.930
Uh, but you're first up in line for tomorrow's work, scene 34.

28:56.130 --> 28:58.900
Well, somebody made a mistake.

29:01.070 --> 29:02.770
Hey, I don't get it.

29:02.830 --> 29:04.700
"Dr. Holden sputters back to life"?

29:04.730 --> 29:06.230
I'm so sorry. I would have told you,

29:06.250 --> 29:07.750
but I only just got the call while you were shooting.

29:07.820 --> 29:08.750
What happened?

29:08.820 --> 29:10.220
The head of Daytime changed her mind.

29:10.380 --> 29:11.720
But it was settled. She agreed.

29:11.780 --> 29:13.050
I fought for you.

29:13.120 --> 29:14.820
I even pitched out a whole story line

29:14.880 --> 29:17.380
in the aftermath of Dr. Holden's death,but she wouldn't budge.

29:17.450 --> 29:19.480
I swear, Cally, if I don't get out of this role,

29:19.550 --> 29:20.480
I really will die.

29:20.550 --> 29:21.680
We'll get through it.

29:21.750 --> 29:23.720
I'll call her, and I will try again. I promise.

29:23.780 --> 29:24.980
Come on.

29:48.520 --> 29:51.550
Sorry, babe, but if you're asking me to beg for my life...

29:51.620 --> 29:52.680
All I'm asking is

29:53.550 --> 29:55.920
please don't get blood on my new Berber.

30:24.279 --> 30:27.202
L I E S

30:28.020 --> 30:30.020
I could never understand why you would deliberately lie to me.

30:30.080 --> 30:31.750
You're not going anywhere.

30:31.820 --> 30:33.850
I still have the files.

30:33.920 --> 30:35.220
You think I care about that?

30:35.280 --> 30:38.050
My father was a hero to me.

30:38.120 --> 30:41.320
I never even got to say good-bye.

30:41.420 --> 30:42.880
What does that even mean, "lies"?

30:42.950 --> 30:44.880
And why did he have to make them come out of my mouth?

30:44.950 --> 30:46.080
That's where lies usually come from.

30:46.150 --> 30:47.650
You know what? You're not helping.

30:47.720 --> 30:48.975
And whose lies are we talking about, Cally's,

30:48.982 --> 30:50.020
Grant's, or Brook's?

30:50.080 --> 30:51.020
Or all of them.

30:51.080 --> 30:52.880
And does this even have to do with Miles' death?

30:52.950 --> 30:55.650
Because there hasn't been one dream or vision with a gun or blood.

30:55.720 --> 30:57.820
What was the color of that goo you yakked?

30:57.880 --> 30:59.720
Green. Thanks for bringing that up.

30:59.780 --> 31:01.320
So to speak. Get it?

31:01.380 --> 31:03.380
You said Cally didn't look happy

31:03.450 --> 31:06.050
when she found Grant and Brook together yesterday.

31:06.120 --> 31:08.320
Yeah. Something went on with those three in college.

31:08.380 --> 31:10.350
It's like there's a soap behind the soap.

31:10.420 --> 31:13.250
Yeah. Or I guess you could say acting is lying.

31:13.320 --> 31:15.650
So is writing. It's making stuff up.

31:15.720 --> 31:18.220
Is that what this is about, the show?

31:18.430 --> 31:20.800
'cause why would Miles care about that?

31:20.870 --> 31:22.030
Yeah, and speaking of which,

31:22.100 --> 31:23.200
What are they filming today?

31:23.270 --> 31:24.970
Uh, they're in an alley behind city hall.

31:25.030 --> 31:27.500
It's that scene where Dr. Holden's body's being brought out

31:27.570 --> 31:29.330
And, you know, he comes back to life.

31:29.400 --> 31:30.900
How do you know all this?

31:32.170 --> 31:35.270
Because I'm sexy coroner number 2.

31:35.330 --> 31:38.270
Wait. You won the walk-on part?

31:38.330 --> 31:41.570
Jim...Jim put me up for it.

31:41.630 --> 31:43.930
I'm late for hair and makeup.

31:45.730 --> 31:47.300
And...

31:47.570 --> 31:48.730
Action!

31:52.530 --> 31:53.470
Cut. Cut,cut.

31:53.530 --> 31:54.800
Melinda.

31:54.870 --> 31:57.130
You're not on your mark. Again.

31:57.200 --> 31:58.370
Oh, I was looking for it.

31:58.430 --> 31:59.570
- Back to one! - I...I really...

31:59.630 --> 32:01.700
It's the pink tape right there.

32:01.770 --> 32:02.500
- Oh, the pink tape!  - See?

32:02.560 --> 32:03.790
- Ok? Ok. - Got it. Sorry.

32:03.860 --> 32:05.120
You're doing a fantastic job.

32:05.190 --> 32:06.320
Aw, thank you.

32:06.390 --> 32:08.190
In fact, please feel free to screw up every take.

32:08.260 --> 32:09.390
Well, I didn't exactly screw...

32:09.460 --> 32:10.860
We don't have a choice here,Grant. I'm sorry.

32:10.920 --> 32:13.060
No, actually, I'm the only one without a choice.

32:13.420 --> 32:14.660
You have plenty.

32:14.720 --> 32:16.090
I told you. Now come on.

32:16.160 --> 32:17.260
We gotta get this scene.

32:17.320 --> 32:19.060
I asked my agent to call the network.

32:19.120 --> 32:21.020
Um,everyone, take five!

32:21.090 --> 32:22.460
Grant,let's go talk in my trailer.

32:22.520 --> 32:23.760
You lied to me, Cal.

32:23.820 --> 32:27.260
You're the one who decided to keep me on the show, only you.

32:27.320 --> 32:28.620
Ok, I'm sorry.

32:28.790 --> 32:30.290
I was just trying to protect you.

32:30.360 --> 32:32.320
The only thing I need protecting from is you.

32:32.390 --> 32:34.190
- I want out. - What?

32:34.260 --> 32:36.720
The cushiest job in the business, a great career.

32:36.790 --> 32:38.120
No, us.

32:39.060 --> 32:40.890
Look, I...I know I owe you a lot,

32:40.960 --> 32:41.860
Maybe everything,

32:41.920 --> 32:44.260
And maybe that's why I stayed so long.

32:44.320 --> 32:46.290
But I need to go. I'm done.

32:46.360 --> 32:50.790
You're not done until I say so.

32:50.860 --> 32:52.590
You're still under contract.

32:53.820 --> 32:56.360
All right,Duff! From the top, ok?

32:56.420 --> 32:58.490
This is the one, you guys. Lots of energy.

32:58.560 --> 33:00.690
Stand by! Picture's up! Let's go!

33:01.160 --> 33:05.920
That sounds just like Celeste and Dr. Holden on the show.

33:05.990 --> 33:07.820
Wait a minute.

33:07.890 --> 33:09.920
That's it.

33:11.020 --> 33:13.620
You're doing what you did in grad school.

33:13.690 --> 33:14.690
You're giving them notes.

33:14.760 --> 33:16.090
You want her to change the script.

33:16.160 --> 33:18.560
Dr. Holden must leave Hope's Edge,

33:18.620 --> 33:21.490
And if Cally won't kill him,

33:21.860 --> 33:23.220
I will.

33:24.390 --> 33:26.090
What's going on?

33:26.160 --> 33:28.020
Were you just talking to the ghost?

33:28.090 --> 33:31.290
You know what? I've seen ghosts try to manipulate...ooh.

33:31.360 --> 33:34.460
Sorry...tvs, but never enjoy them.

33:34.520 --> 33:36.260
What does that mean?

33:36.320 --> 33:38.120
Is the ghost a fan of the show?

33:38.190 --> 33:39.190
Picture's up!

33:39.260 --> 33:41.220
Melinda, we need you on your mark!

33:41.290 --> 33:43.090
Oh. Um, more of a critic, actually.

33:43.160 --> 33:44.660
He wants him to change the story line,

33:44.680 --> 33:46.360
But I'm not sure how far he'll go.

33:46.420 --> 33:47.260
Ok. Pink tape.

33:47.320 --> 33:49.490
Ok. Good luck.

33:50.120 --> 33:51.820
And...

33:52.690 --> 33:53.890
Action!

33:59.220 --> 34:00.620
What the hell?

34:01.760 --> 34:02.690
Hey,Jerry! Jerry! The crane!

34:02.760 --> 34:04.590
- Hey,cut! Cut it! - I was on it!

34:04.660 --> 34:06.520
- That's a cut! - We can't stop it!

34:06.590 --> 34:07.890
It's gonna hit her! Watch it!

34:09.360 --> 34:11.760
Ok,Miles, cut, print, wrap,

34:11.820 --> 34:13.590
Or whatever it is you people say.

34:13.960 --> 34:16.159
It's over.

34:16.219 --> 34:17.219
Sorry about your hand.

34:17.290 --> 34:18.255
Yeah, well, you should be.

34:18.255 --> 34:20.420
She almost broke a bone with that crane stunt.

34:20.489 --> 34:22.020
It's a sprain. I'll live.

34:22.790 --> 34:24.260
I wish I could say the same.

34:24.320 --> 34:25.620
Yeah, well, I might have felt more sorry for you

34:25.690 --> 34:27.719
If you hadn't just tried to kill my friend.

34:27.719 --> 34:29.090
It's okay.

34:30.190 --> 34:32.590
Listen, I wasn't trying to kill anyone.

34:32.659 --> 34:34.760
I just wanted to stop them from filming that idiotic scene.

34:34.820 --> 34:37.860
Why? Because you didn't like the story Cally was tellin'?

34:37.920 --> 34:39.460
You're not doing plays anymore.

34:39.520 --> 34:40.389
This is real life.

34:40.460 --> 34:41.489
Yes, I'm aware of that.

34:41.560 --> 34:43.520
Ok,so then, why do you keep trying

34:43.590 --> 34:45.460
To get them to change the story line?

34:45.520 --> 34:46.989
Is it some sort of revenge?

34:47.060 --> 34:47.989
Revenge for what?

34:48.060 --> 34:50.120
You were shot to death on this stage.

34:50.190 --> 34:51.889
You have to blame someone for that.

34:51.960 --> 34:54.190
No, I do,but it's none of them.

34:55.460 --> 34:56.989
Who are you talking to?

34:58.090 --> 35:00.190
We came right over. What's the emergency?

35:00.260 --> 35:02.360
I'm due in editing.

35:02.420 --> 35:04.290
Miles wants to talk to you.

35:04.360 --> 35:07.790
What's going on? Did you put 'em up to this?

35:07.860 --> 35:10.020
It's real,Grant.

35:11.260 --> 35:13.060
Just hear them out.

35:15.160 --> 35:17.320
So those accidents weren't really accidents?

35:17.390 --> 35:19.060
Except for the one where I tackled you.

35:19.120 --> 35:20.090
That was kind of...

35:20.100 --> 35:21.690
Pure stupidity.

35:21.760 --> 35:24.420
Thanks. Miles, anything to add?

35:24.490 --> 35:25.520
We're all waiting.

35:25.590 --> 35:26.990
Well,first of all, you can tell them

35:27.060 --> 35:29.060
To stop wallowing in the guilt for killing me,

35:29.120 --> 35:30.720
Because it wasn't their fault.

35:32.120 --> 35:35.420
Miles wants you to know that his death wasn't your fault.

35:37.960 --> 35:41.390
When he saw your reaction to Grant being dropped from the show,

35:41.460 --> 35:44.390
He was afraid that people would start to tank their performances.

35:44.460 --> 35:45.560
I decided to shake things up,

35:45.620 --> 35:48.320
So I put a double charge in the gun,

35:48.350 --> 35:52.860
Thought an extra-large blast would put some life into the second act.

35:54.190 --> 35:57.260
He put a double charge into the gun.

35:58.460 --> 36:00.860
That is so Miles.

36:03.390 --> 36:05.860
What about everything that he did,

36:05.920 --> 36:07.220
All those hauntings?

36:07.290 --> 36:08.760
What does he want from us?

36:08.820 --> 36:11.220
It's not about what I want.

36:12.420 --> 36:15.290
But the vision that you gave me,

36:15.360 --> 36:16.720
The word "lies"...

36:17.720 --> 36:18.890
Who's lying?

36:18.960 --> 36:19.960
Who isn't?

36:20.020 --> 36:21.620
And what does any of this

36:21.690 --> 36:23.290
Have to do with Grant leaving the show?

36:23.360 --> 36:26.220
Is it that you didn't want him to be with Cally?

36:26.290 --> 36:28.490
Why would I care who he chooses to be with?

36:28.560 --> 36:30.090
I'm dead.

36:32.660 --> 36:35.260
Just as long as he follows his dreams.

36:35.320 --> 36:37.260
Right?

36:37.320 --> 36:39.390
That's why you wanted us to watch the show,

36:39.460 --> 36:42.660
Because Grant and his character have the same problem.

36:48.390 --> 36:50.290
Uh, not following our dreams...

36:50.360 --> 36:51.890
What's he talking about?

36:51.960 --> 36:53.090
Miles is saying that

36:53.160 --> 36:55.990
he thinks you should take the job at Rockland U,

36:56.060 --> 36:57.720
And as usual,

36:57.790 --> 36:59.760
He's right.

36:59.820 --> 37:01.390
Cal, is...Is this some sort of trick?

37:01.460 --> 37:02.960
Are you setting me up again?

37:03.020 --> 37:04.790
If this is about lies,

37:04.860 --> 37:08.020
I think I know what Miles has in mind.

37:08.690 --> 37:12.460
Grant, That night, when I told you

37:12.520 --> 37:15.760
The producers wanted Miles for your part,

37:15.820 --> 37:17.490
It wasn't true.

37:18.890 --> 37:21.190
They offered to keep the whole cast.

37:21.260 --> 37:22.790
They wanted me for the lead?

37:25.120 --> 37:26.120
I don't understand.

37:26.190 --> 37:28.320
I had been offered that job in L.A.,

37:28.390 --> 37:32.990
And I was afraid if you went to the city to do the play...

37:33.060 --> 37:35.320
I would get back with Brook.

37:40.520 --> 37:41.990
I was right, wasn't I?

37:42.060 --> 37:44.160
I don't know.

37:45.820 --> 37:48.660
Would you hate me for hoping yes?

37:51.720 --> 37:53.520
Hate you?

37:55.690 --> 37:58.160
I wish I could.

37:59.460 --> 38:01.660
I bet I know what Miles is saying right now.

38:01.720 --> 38:03.720
He thinks I'm Celeste

38:03.790 --> 38:06.190
And that I never really loved Grant,

38:06.260 --> 38:10.220
But that I wouldn't let anybody else have him.

38:10.290 --> 38:12.460
Is that true?

38:12.520 --> 38:14.990
No. Look at her.

38:15.060 --> 38:16.460
She loved him,

38:16.520 --> 38:17.660
Maybe too much.

38:17.720 --> 38:21.020
She just held on too tight.

38:21.090 --> 38:23.620
He thinks you have a really good heart.

38:25.420 --> 38:27.590
You just need to learn to use it.

38:32.090 --> 38:33.990
Your turn.

38:34.060 --> 38:36.220
Miles says you kept coming back to Cally,

38:36.290 --> 38:39.120
Because you're afraid you won't be able to succeed without her.

38:40.460 --> 38:43.060
You were afraid of her holding you back,

38:43.120 --> 38:45.620
But you did that to yourself.

38:46.520 --> 38:47.490
Ouch.

38:47.560 --> 38:49.420
Truth hurts, doesn't it?

38:49.490 --> 38:51.690
Try not to enjoy it so much, Miles.

38:53.160 --> 38:54.860
It's my turn.

38:55.920 --> 38:57.890
I think I can guess.

38:58.820 --> 39:02.990
Do you, uh, mind if I tell them?

39:05.660 --> 39:09.690
Grant has been writing me and calling me for years,

39:09.760 --> 39:12.560
Every time he and Cally broke up.

39:12.620 --> 39:14.490
I just never wrote him back.

39:15.920 --> 39:19.160
I just told myself I didn't want that life.

39:20.060 --> 39:21.720
That was a lie.

39:21.790 --> 39:23.460
You were afraid, too.

39:25.390 --> 39:27.920
To take a chance on you.

39:32.420 --> 39:33.920
Now you understand?

39:35.360 --> 39:38.360
I couldn't stand seeing them live their lives like this...

39:39.660 --> 39:42.720
Especially when they were so close to being happy.

39:42.790 --> 39:45.960
Just had to knock some truth in their heads.

39:52.990 --> 39:53.990
What's happening?

39:54.060 --> 39:56.820
I think he's ready to go.

39:56.890 --> 39:58.620
But if he leaves,

39:58.690 --> 40:00.820
Who's going to keep me honest?

40:00.890 --> 40:02.590
Tell her to remember me

40:02.660 --> 40:04.660
And that...

40:05.660 --> 40:07.890
And I'll always be right here.

40:08.720 --> 40:10.060
I'll tell her.

40:20.460 --> 40:22.360
Now, that's a spotlight.

40:33.790 --> 40:35.690
He's gone.

40:46.590 --> 40:50.960
Uhh. Waiting for you... in hell.

40:54.120 --> 40:55.920
And this time, he really dies.

40:56.790 --> 40:58.420
Along with my acting debut.

40:58.490 --> 41:00.090
I'm sorry they cut your scene,babe.

41:00.160 --> 41:02.560
Enh. It's all right. It's show biz.

41:03.890 --> 41:05.160
Ms. Gordon.

41:05.220 --> 41:07.960
It says here you hurt your hand last Thursday.

41:08.020 --> 41:10.390
Yeah. Yeah, I was hoping that it would get better.

41:10.460 --> 41:11.290
I tried to get her to come in early,

41:11.360 --> 41:14.460
- But she's, um, plain stubborn. - Right.

41:14.520 --> 41:16.820
Well, we'll have to do an x-ray to see if it's broken.

41:16.890 --> 41:19.020
So are you currently taking any medications?

41:19.090 --> 41:19.760
Nope.

41:19.820 --> 41:21.460
Any chance you're pregnant?

41:23.020 --> 41:26.190
We have to know what precaution to take for the x-ray.

41:26.260 --> 41:27.320
No.

41:27.390 --> 41:30.320
No, I'm not pregnant.

41:30.390 --> 41:32.120
Are you sure?

41:32.190 --> 41:34.060
How long's it been since your last period?

41:34.120 --> 41:36.420
Well, um...

41:37.720 --> 41:40.160
Well, I have been preoccupied.

41:58.890 --> 42:01.420
Oh, my god. That's a baby.

42:04.320 --> 42:05.890
That's a heartbeat.

42:10.290 --> 42:12.860
Ok, uh,8 weeks, right?

42:12.920 --> 42:14.560
- Yeah. - Which means...

42:14.620 --> 42:16.820
That means it happened before you...

42:18.360 --> 42:20.090
Went away...

42:20.160 --> 42:21.620
And came back.

42:24.190 --> 42:25.790
Tell me it's real.

42:28.320 --> 42:29.760
Please tell me it's real.

42:31.660 --> 42:32.920
It's real.
