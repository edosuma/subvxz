00:02.001 --> 00:04.212
Previously on Lost:

00:06.757 --> 00:08.633
I think... I think I'm all right.

00:08.717 --> 00:11.177
- I told you I'd take care of you.
- Thanks, Charlie.

00:11.261 --> 00:12.845
You're quite welcome.

00:12.930 --> 00:15.014
- Listen to me.
- Sayid.

00:15.099 --> 00:17.183
We're not alone.

00:17.267 --> 00:19.644
I was sleeping, and I woke up,

00:19.728 --> 00:22.271
and he was trying to hurt my baby.

00:22.356 --> 00:24.774
- We gotta find out who everyone is.
- A census.

00:24.858 --> 00:25.983
- Lance!
- Sorry?

00:26.068 --> 00:27.527
- Your name's Lance?
- Ethan.

00:27.611 --> 00:29.028
Dude, that's right.

00:29.113 --> 00:31.322
I want you to take these.
They're very mild.

00:31.407 --> 00:33.449
You think I'm making this up?

00:33.534 --> 00:36.035
It was safe at the beach.
It's not safe here.

00:36.120 --> 00:37.995
- What did you say?
- We got a problem.

00:38.080 --> 00:39.956
The census.
I interviewed everyone.

00:40.040 --> 00:42.709
One isn't in the manifest.
He wasn't on the plane.

00:42.793 --> 00:44.585
Ethan.

00:50.342 --> 00:52.385
- Who wasn't on the plane?
- Ethan.

00:52.469 --> 00:54.303
He's not on the passenger manifest.

00:54.388 --> 00:56.889
- Where is he?
- I saw him yesterday...

00:56.974 --> 01:00.184
- Has anyone seen Ethan?
- Yeah, he went to get some wood.

01:00.310 --> 01:03.855
Took off on the path to the beach.
Is he OK? What happened?

01:03.939 --> 01:06.399
- Where's Charlie?
- What?

01:06.483 --> 01:08.025
Where's Charlie?

01:08.110 --> 01:10.027
He went after Claire.

01:26.503 --> 01:28.129
Jack!

01:37.931 --> 01:40.099
She was moving back to the beach.

01:40.184 --> 01:43.436
Claire. That's hers.

01:43.520 --> 01:45.438
What happened? Where are they?

01:45.522 --> 01:47.315
I don't know.

01:48.358 --> 01:50.443
Footprints.

01:50.527 --> 01:53.070
At least three distinct sets
all over the place.

01:53.155 --> 01:55.656
It looks like there
might have been a struggle.

01:56.992 --> 01:58.576
What? What is it?

01:58.660 --> 02:02.205
Drag marks here, and here.

02:02.289 --> 02:06.125
Claire and Charlie.
They were together.

02:06.210 --> 02:08.544
I think they've been taken.

02:58.136 --> 03:00.429
The tracks are still fresh.

03:01.181 --> 03:02.765
This doesn't make any sense.

03:02.850 --> 03:05.434
How could one man drag two people,
one pregnant?

03:05.519 --> 03:08.980
You're asking the wrong question.
Not how, why?

03:10.232 --> 03:12.733
- You think it was Ethan?
- Feels like it was Ethan.

03:12.818 --> 03:14.735
By himself? How?

03:14.820 --> 03:16.863
We can't account for all of our people.

03:16.947 --> 03:20.116
And more importantly, who's to say
they're even our people?

03:20.200 --> 03:23.536
- What?
- Sayid said there were others.

03:23.620 --> 03:26.205
- Sayid said we're not alone.
- Semantics.

03:26.290 --> 03:29.166
Sayid's injured.
We don't even know where he went.

03:29.251 --> 03:32.211
- This is what the ground is telling me.
- So, which way?

03:32.296 --> 03:34.380
Jack, we don't know
what's going on here.

03:34.464 --> 03:36.549
- We know enough.
- We need to prepare.

03:36.633 --> 03:39.844
We could be back at the caves,
organize a search party...

03:39.928 --> 03:42.305
Which way did they go, Locke?

04:01.450 --> 04:03.701
- Stats are dropping.
- Come on.

04:04.536 --> 04:07.371
- She's bleeding.
- I've got the artery almost there.

04:07.456 --> 04:08.998
She's in arrest.

04:09.082 --> 04:11.709
One milligram epi.
Let's get the crash cart!

04:11.793 --> 04:14.253
All right, artery's sealed.
Close her up.

04:14.338 --> 04:15.546
- Charged?
- Charged.

04:16.548 --> 04:17.757
Clear.

04:19.009 --> 04:21.344
- Charged?
- We're charged.

04:21.428 --> 04:22.553
Clear.

04:27.559 --> 04:29.226
Come on.

04:29.311 --> 04:31.354
Come on back now.

04:32.689 --> 04:35.107
Come on now. Come on back.

04:36.234 --> 04:37.443
Come on.

04:38.695 --> 04:40.279
Call it.

04:40.364 --> 04:42.073
Come on, baby. Come back.

04:42.157 --> 04:43.908
Come on, baby.

04:45.535 --> 04:47.787
Come on now. You can do this.

04:49.164 --> 04:50.831
Come on.

04:54.044 --> 04:55.962
Call it, Jack.

04:59.466 --> 05:02.218
It's over. Call it.

05:20.278 --> 05:21.779
You call it.

05:26.076 --> 05:28.494
You let him go alone?

05:28.578 --> 05:32.039
Don't worry, I'll catch up.

05:32.124 --> 05:33.833
What's the word from the beach?

05:33.917 --> 05:35.835
Nothing.
Nobody has seen him.

05:35.919 --> 05:38.337
- I'm coming with you.
- I figured you might.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.507
What are you doing?

05:41.591 --> 05:43.509
We need to get back to the beach.

05:43.593 --> 05:45.845
You're forming a search party.
Can I help?

05:45.929 --> 05:48.764
This is a deserted island.
There's no choppers.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.975
How exactly are you gonna find them?

05:51.059 --> 05:53.269
By following Ethan's trail.

05:53.353 --> 05:56.397
No one can walk without leaving signs,
bending grass,

05:56.481 --> 05:59.358
breaking twigs,
especially with captives in tow.

06:00.235 --> 06:03.821
And yes, I could use another hand
if you're up for it.

06:03.905 --> 06:06.073
- I'm up for it.
- Then let's get moving.

06:11.371 --> 06:14.999
I could take Vincent. He can sniff
something that belonged to Charlie,

06:15.083 --> 06:17.376
- and I can help.
- I said no, man.

06:17.461 --> 06:19.211
Hey, Locke.

06:19.296 --> 06:21.714
A lot of us don't wanna sit here
waiting for news.

06:21.798 --> 06:23.132
Thanks, but we're set.

06:23.216 --> 06:26.552
- Anyone else is gonna slow us down.
- OK.

06:26.636 --> 06:29.013
Maybe I'll just put together
another party.

06:29.139 --> 06:30.389
Good idea.

06:30.474 --> 06:32.349
We're going north. You go south.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.365
Come on.

07:35.872 --> 07:38.374
Never thought
I'd see the day, Jack.

07:38.458 --> 07:42.378
You barge into my OR,
you work on my patient.

07:44.256 --> 07:47.466
- You didn't have to do this.
- I don't have to do anything.

07:47.551 --> 07:49.468
Yeah, of course you don't.

07:49.553 --> 07:52.555
I chose to do this procedure.

07:52.639 --> 07:56.934
This emergency procedure because
when this girl crashed in the ER,

07:57.018 --> 07:58.978
- they called me.
- I was right upstairs.

07:59.062 --> 08:01.313
You should've stayed.
How did you find out?

08:01.398 --> 08:03.649
One of the nurses came to get me.

08:05.110 --> 08:06.193
Who?

08:08.530 --> 08:10.656
Oh, thank God I have you

08:10.740 --> 08:12.825
and some anonymous nurse
to rescue me.

08:12.909 --> 08:14.910
She told me
your hands were shaking.

08:14.995 --> 08:17.496
- My hands were not...
- You cut her artery.

08:17.581 --> 08:20.457
She was in a car crash, Jack.
Her insides were a mess.

08:20.542 --> 08:22.418
- They called me.
- You made a mistake.

08:22.502 --> 08:25.379
I don't care whether they called you,
you made a mistake.

08:25.463 --> 08:29.216
Are you lecturing me?
You tell me, if you were upstairs,

08:29.301 --> 08:33.554
and I was in a restaurant having lunch,
then why did they call me?

08:38.018 --> 08:40.477
How many drinks did you have
at lunch, Dad?

08:58.955 --> 09:00.873
Good thing you were going in a circle.

09:00.957 --> 09:05.544
Not much of a search grid, but we
never would have found you otherwise.

09:05.629 --> 09:07.296
Did you find anything?

09:09.716 --> 09:11.300
No.

09:11.384 --> 09:14.220
You should go back
to the caves... Sayid's leg.

09:14.304 --> 09:16.764
I dressed Sayid's leg.
You found me.

09:16.848 --> 09:19.558
We can find Charlie and Claire.
Do we have a trail?

09:19.643 --> 09:22.228
- Jack, this was my fault.
- What?

09:22.312 --> 09:26.065
I hunted with Ethan, I spent time
with him. I never sensed anything...

09:26.149 --> 09:29.401
...off. For everything I know
about hunting and tracking,

09:29.486 --> 09:31.362
whoever he is, he knows more.

09:31.446 --> 09:33.906
If we catch him,
I don't want anything to happen

09:33.990 --> 09:37.451
to the only physician on the island.
So go back, be the doctor.

09:37.535 --> 09:39.662
Let me be the hunter.

09:44.251 --> 09:45.751
Can we go now?

09:49.422 --> 09:51.215
Follow me.

09:57.013 --> 09:59.682
I'm trying to help,
and the guy tells me "Go south?"

09:59.766 --> 10:02.351
Like what? I'm gonna get
in his way or something?

10:02.435 --> 10:05.562
We're all tweaked.
Locke's feeling it like the rest of us.

10:05.647 --> 10:07.898
I got five guys
who are going with me.

10:08.608 --> 10:11.944
Putting our necks on the line
to find Charlie and Claire.

10:12.028 --> 10:14.029
I'm saying, I'm sick of being treated

10:14.114 --> 10:16.448
like a second-class citizen around here

10:16.533 --> 10:18.951
because Mount Baldy can bag a boar.

10:19.035 --> 10:21.412
He knows a lot more
than how to catch a boar.

10:21.496 --> 10:23.414
Mr. Locke's a warrior. He can hunt,

10:23.498 --> 10:26.542
he can track stuff, and he's
the only one who brought knives.

10:26.626 --> 10:29.920
So if it were me, I'd listen to him.

10:32.215 --> 10:34.633
Well, I don't want you to.

10:34.718 --> 10:36.760
You understand?

10:39.306 --> 10:41.557
You stay with Hurley.

10:42.600 --> 10:45.185
I might not be a warrior,

10:45.812 --> 10:48.480
but I am going south.

10:53.695 --> 10:55.321
Back home,

10:55.405 --> 10:59.074
I'm known as something
of a warrior myself.

11:11.254 --> 11:15.632
We mark our progress by line of sight.

11:15.717 --> 11:18.177
Tie these off so we don't get lost.

11:18.720 --> 11:21.597
You can lead us back to camp, right?

11:23.224 --> 11:25.309
If nothing happens to me.

11:27.479 --> 11:29.772
Maybe I'd better take marker detail.

11:35.153 --> 11:37.988
- Anything?
- Not yet.

11:38.990 --> 11:41.825
- If you can't find the trail...
- I'll pick it up again.

11:41.910 --> 11:43.869
We need to rest,
get our clarity back.

11:43.953 --> 11:47.373
You're gonna take a break?
It's gotta be almost 4:00.

11:47.457 --> 11:49.333
- When the sun sets...
- It's 4:25.

11:49.417 --> 11:51.710
And, yes, I'm taking a break.

11:59.969 --> 12:01.512
Can I talk to you for a sec?

12:04.474 --> 12:07.726
Would it kill you to give the guy
a little space?

12:07.811 --> 12:09.353
It might.

12:10.563 --> 12:12.898
- Stop that.
- What?

12:13.650 --> 12:15.025
That.

12:21.449 --> 12:23.367
What's going on?

12:27.163 --> 12:29.331
I didn't believe her.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.500
Claire. I gave her a sedative.

12:31.584 --> 12:35.045
She told me someone was after her,
she was being attacked, and I...

12:35.713 --> 12:37.464
She just seemed so out of it.

12:37.549 --> 12:40.884
I thought that her pregnancy
was amping up her stress, and I...

12:43.721 --> 12:45.681
I didn't believe her.

13:02.866 --> 13:03.907
What is it?

13:08.037 --> 13:10.956
- Look familiar?
- It's Charlie's.

13:11.040 --> 13:13.625
You think it just came off?

13:13.710 --> 13:15.461
No.

13:15.545 --> 13:17.671
He's leaving us a trail.

13:33.730 --> 13:35.981
They went this way.

13:36.065 --> 13:38.275
I'm not so sure.

13:38.359 --> 13:40.277
There's another trail here.

13:43.239 --> 13:45.657
- What do you mean?
- These are footprints.

13:45.742 --> 13:47.493
People moved off this way.

13:53.583 --> 13:57.085
Charlie's leaving these for us.
They went that way.

13:57.170 --> 13:59.671
Unless Charlie isn't
the one leaving them.

13:59.756 --> 14:03.175
If Ethan knows we're behind him,
he could be setting up a dummy trail.

14:03.259 --> 14:06.929
Take off in one direction,
double back in his own footprints.

14:08.181 --> 14:12.142
- Wait, now you're a tracker?
- You're just full of surprises.

14:14.771 --> 14:18.690
So we've got two trails.
Let's split up. I'll take that one.

14:18.775 --> 14:20.025
We should stay together.

14:20.109 --> 14:23.779
Why? We've got two trails,
and apparently two trackers.

14:28.952 --> 14:30.118
Be careful.

14:41.548 --> 14:44.716
- Who got taken by what?
- Charlie and Claire.

14:44.801 --> 14:47.844
- They think Ethan took 'em.
- Ethan took 'em?

14:47.929 --> 14:49.555
Yeah.

14:49.639 --> 14:52.849
Took 'em why?
And who the hell's Ethan?

14:52.934 --> 14:56.228
I don't know. He wasn't on
the list thing, the manifest.

14:56.312 --> 14:58.814
Ever think he might have
lied about his name?

14:58.898 --> 15:01.108
It's stupid to lie about your name.

15:04.320 --> 15:07.573
All righty, Tattoo.
Where do you think Ethan came from?

15:07.657 --> 15:11.451
Maybe he was already
on the island before we were.

15:13.162 --> 15:16.039
Got yourself one hell
of an imagination, kid.

15:16.124 --> 15:18.208
There could be lots of other people.

15:18.293 --> 15:21.211
So a tribe of evil natives
planted a ringer in the camp

15:21.296 --> 15:26.008
to kidnap a pregnant girl
and a reject from VH-1 has-beens.

15:26.092 --> 15:28.135
Yeah, fiendishly clever.

15:30.346 --> 15:32.931
And why am I getting the news
from a 6-year-old?

15:33.016 --> 15:36.435
- I'm 10.
- OK, then it must be true.

15:36.519 --> 15:40.564
If you don't believe me, ask Sayid.
He said we're not alone.

15:44.319 --> 15:45.652
Sayid's back?

15:55.872 --> 16:00.959
Red shirt.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.212
You ever watch Star Trek?

16:04.297 --> 16:06.340
Oh, not really.

16:06.424 --> 16:10.761
The crew guys that would go down
to the planet with the main guys,

16:10.845 --> 16:13.722
the captain and the guy
with the pointy ears.

16:15.183 --> 16:18.518
They always wore red shirts,
and they always got killed.

16:19.228 --> 16:21.271
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

16:23.900 --> 16:26.318
Sounds like a piss-poor captain.

16:30.073 --> 16:32.699
What do you do
in the real world, Mr. Locke?

16:32.784 --> 16:35.243
- It's John.
- John.

16:36.037 --> 16:37.871
Why don't you guess?

16:37.955 --> 16:40.832
You're either a taxidermist
or a hit man.

16:43.961 --> 16:46.046
I was a...

16:46.130 --> 16:51.343
...regional collections supervisor
for a box company.

16:52.845 --> 16:54.638
A box company?

16:56.557 --> 16:58.934
They made boxes.

17:04.523 --> 17:06.441
Yeah, right.

17:06.526 --> 17:09.528
- Please slow down!
- You said they went this way.

17:09.612 --> 17:13.281
I think they went this way.
I'm not as good at this as Locke is.

17:16.452 --> 17:19.371
So where'd you pick up
the tracking skills, Kate?

17:19.454 --> 17:22.249
Was that before
or after you were on the run?

17:24.794 --> 17:27.212
- I'm trying to help.
- You know what might help?

17:27.296 --> 17:31.883
A little honesty.
Just give me something real.

17:34.804 --> 17:38.640
My dad was in the army.
Ranger Battalion.

17:38.725 --> 17:41.643
We were stationed
at Fort Lewis, Washington State.

17:46.649 --> 17:48.775
We'd go hiking together.

17:49.819 --> 17:52.487
One day we spent
eight hours tracking deer.

17:55.867 --> 17:57.659
Being in the woods, it was like...

17:57.744 --> 18:00.036
It was like his religion.

18:13.342 --> 18:15.135
That was real.

18:16.721 --> 18:19.014
Anything you wanna share?

18:24.020 --> 18:26.688
Well, thanks for coming in, Jack.
Have a seat.

18:38.618 --> 18:41.953
- What's it say?
- The truth.

18:42.038 --> 18:44.790
A patient was brought to the ER
following a car accident,

18:44.874 --> 18:47.334
rushed into surgery
with internal bleeding.

18:47.418 --> 18:50.712
You joined me, and in spite
of our most heroic efforts,

18:50.797 --> 18:53.507
the patient succumbed to her injuries.

18:55.343 --> 18:58.386
Looks like you fixed everything
but the patient.

19:00.723 --> 19:03.308
You had no business being in OR.

19:03.392 --> 19:05.477
You think I would have walked in there

19:05.561 --> 19:08.146
- if I couldn't handle it?
- You've done it before.

19:08.231 --> 19:11.107
That's right, because I am capable
of making those...

19:11.192 --> 19:13.485
How can you say that
after what happened?

19:13.569 --> 19:16.071
- The problem is not...
- You were impaired.

19:16.155 --> 19:18.240
I know my limits.

19:18.324 --> 19:21.827
- I won't sign this.
- You were part of a team, Jack.

19:21.911 --> 19:23.662
I'm not the only one on the hook.

19:23.746 --> 19:25.872
You called me off.

19:25.957 --> 19:28.416
You were the surgeon of record
when she died.

19:32.588 --> 19:35.298
Look, accidents happen
in surgeries all the time.

19:35.383 --> 19:38.635
That's the truth, and you know it.

19:38.719 --> 19:40.554
But if you contradict this report,

19:40.638 --> 19:42.848
if you mention alcohol,

19:42.932 --> 19:45.976
well, that's the only fact
that's gonna matter.

19:46.060 --> 19:48.061
They'll strip me of my license.

19:49.897 --> 19:51.606
Yes.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.567
They will.

20:02.493 --> 20:07.122
I know... I have been hard on you.

20:08.958 --> 20:13.253
But that is how you make
a soft metal into steel.

20:13.337 --> 20:15.922
That is why you are

20:16.007 --> 20:18.633
the most gifted young surgeon
in this city.

20:25.892 --> 20:29.895
I mean, this...
this is a career

20:29.979 --> 20:32.731
that is all about the greater good.

20:34.317 --> 20:36.818
I've had to sacrifice

20:36.903 --> 20:40.655
certain aspects
of my relationship with you

20:41.324 --> 20:46.578
so that hundreds and thousands
of patients will live

20:47.622 --> 20:50.874
because of your extraordinary skills.

21:06.474 --> 21:09.100
I know it's a long...

21:09.185 --> 21:11.478
...long time coming.

21:16.150 --> 21:20.278
What happened yesterday,

21:21.405 --> 21:24.449
I promise you,

21:24.533 --> 21:26.159
will never happen again.

21:30.873 --> 21:34.042
After all that I've given...

21:40.383 --> 21:44.552
This isn't... This is not
just about my career, Jack.

21:46.555 --> 21:48.640
It's my life.

22:14.458 --> 22:17.419
Thank you, son. Thank you.

22:40.484 --> 22:41.651
Well, well.

22:43.571 --> 22:47.032
I don't know if you Islams got
a concept of karma,

22:47.116 --> 22:50.201
but I get the sense this island
just served you up a platter

22:50.286 --> 22:52.203
of cosmic payback.

22:53.372 --> 22:55.874
- What do you want?
- Dr. Do-Right doesn't trust me

22:55.958 --> 22:59.794
with his antibiotics, so I gotta hump it
up here every day to get my meds.

23:02.465 --> 23:05.592
You know,
a less magnanimous man than I

23:05.676 --> 23:08.595
might be thinking he could beat
the living snot out of you

23:08.679 --> 23:12.474
- without fear of reprisal.
- You want a shot, take it.

23:14.060 --> 23:17.645
Know that I left this camp out of shame
for what I did to you.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.564
It was never my intention to return.

23:19.648 --> 23:22.317
Sorry, fresh out of sweet forgiveness.

23:24.570 --> 23:28.156
If it wasn't your intention to return,
then why did you?

23:29.283 --> 23:31.993
I was taken prisoner
by the Frenchwoman.

23:34.538 --> 23:37.082
One who's been sending out
a distress signal for 16 years?

23:37.166 --> 23:41.169
- She's alive?
- She was on a science expedition.

23:41.253 --> 23:44.255
- She said they shipwrecked.
- She alone?

23:44.340 --> 23:47.383
She said that there are others
on this island.

23:47.468 --> 23:49.052
- Her people?
- No.

23:49.136 --> 23:51.513
She believed they had all gotten sick.

23:53.140 --> 23:55.892
She murdered her entire team.

23:58.521 --> 24:00.522
Right.

24:02.441 --> 24:05.151
- These others, who are they?
- I don't know.

24:05.236 --> 24:07.779
- She's never seen them.
- She's never seen them,

24:07.863 --> 24:10.782
- but she knows they're there?
- If you believe her.

24:10.866 --> 24:12.534
Do you?

24:14.453 --> 24:16.663
Maybe.

24:16.747 --> 24:18.081
Maybe not.

24:19.917 --> 24:22.418
But on my way back,

24:25.005 --> 24:27.340
I heard something in the jungle,

24:27.424 --> 24:30.552
- surrounding me.
- Something like what?

24:34.014 --> 24:37.142
Have you got something
to say to me, Sawyer?

24:37.226 --> 24:39.185
Or are you going to ask me questions

24:39.270 --> 24:41.604
you know I don't have the answers to?

24:48.237 --> 24:49.946
Tide's coming up the beach.

24:50.030 --> 24:52.824
The plane hull's almost in the water.

24:55.244 --> 24:57.662
I kept your signal fire burning.

25:05.296 --> 25:07.005
- Crap.
- Your blots can't get in.

25:07.089 --> 25:08.548
I know my blots can't get in.

25:08.632 --> 25:10.300
- My roll.
- Yahoo.

25:10.384 --> 25:12.594
I need a four-three.

25:20.269 --> 25:22.270
Dude, would you please roll?

25:24.607 --> 25:25.982
- Yes!
- No!

25:26.066 --> 25:27.775
Your turn.

25:31.989 --> 25:34.991
It's OK. I wasn't good
when I started playing, either.

25:35.075 --> 25:36.868
I didn't just start playing.

25:36.952 --> 25:38.578
I took 17th in a tournament once.

25:38.662 --> 25:40.038
17th is not very good.

25:40.122 --> 25:42.624
No, 17th is very good.

25:43.334 --> 25:45.627
Come on, double sixes, double sixes.

25:48.047 --> 25:49.881
- Yes!
- You gotta be kidding me.

25:49.965 --> 25:52.634
- I'm lucky.
- No one is that lucky.

25:52.718 --> 25:54.928
My dad said I was
the luckiest person he knew.

25:55.012 --> 25:56.554
Really?

25:56.639 --> 25:59.515
Not Michael.
Brian, my other dad.

26:06.982 --> 26:09.317
Yes!

26:09.401 --> 26:11.402
One more game.
Double or nothing.

26:11.487 --> 26:13.238
I can't. I got a meeting.

26:13.322 --> 26:15.990
- A meeting?
- Yeah, a meeting.

26:16.075 --> 26:18.326
You owe me $20,000.

26:18.410 --> 26:20.245
You'll get it.

26:26.293 --> 26:29.128
It's been about 15 minutes
since we've seen any sign.

26:30.130 --> 26:33.591
- What are we following?
- My gut.

26:33.676 --> 26:34.884
Great.

26:37.179 --> 26:41.224
So, Boone, what do you do
in the real world?

26:41.308 --> 26:43.268
I run a business.

26:43.352 --> 26:45.019
What kind of business?

26:45.104 --> 26:47.272
It's a wedding thing.

26:49.858 --> 26:52.777
My mother has this empire.

26:52.861 --> 26:54.612
The Martha Stewart of matrimony.

26:54.697 --> 26:56.406
I run one of the subsidiaries.

26:56.490 --> 26:58.741
So, who's running it now?

26:59.785 --> 27:01.786
I guess it doesn't matter, does it?

27:02.746 --> 27:06.374
I'm sure there are people
who can handle it temporarily.

27:06.458 --> 27:09.335
It's gonna start raining in one minute.

27:09.420 --> 27:11.921
- One minute?
- Give or take a few seconds.

27:13.716 --> 27:16.050
- You should head back.
- What?

27:16.135 --> 27:18.678
Trail's been cold,
dangerous terrain ahead.

27:18.762 --> 27:20.513
You'll make it back before dark.

27:20.597 --> 27:22.515
- And you?
- I take care of myself.

27:22.599 --> 27:24.267
- No.
- I admire your courage...

27:24.351 --> 27:26.477
I'm not heading back.

27:29.064 --> 27:31.065
All right.

27:47.624 --> 27:51.252
They teach you how to predict
the weather at a box company?

28:05.768 --> 28:07.935
I guess we were right.

28:12.107 --> 28:13.733
Where to now?

28:23.660 --> 28:26.371
Jack, where are you going?

28:28.040 --> 28:31.000
- Didn't you hear her?
- Hear who?

29:18.132 --> 29:20.925
If you do not stop following me,

29:21.009 --> 29:23.511
I will kill one of them.

29:24.346 --> 29:26.097
Do you understand?

29:45.242 --> 29:47.160
No more warnings.

29:58.297 --> 30:00.465
Blue team to ICU, please.

30:04.303 --> 30:06.304
- Dr. Shephard.
- Andrea.

30:06.388 --> 30:07.889
Andrea.

30:09.391 --> 30:11.559
That man that my father's talking to.

30:11.643 --> 30:12.977
Who is that?

30:13.061 --> 30:14.896
That's her husband.

30:15.814 --> 30:17.732
He's threatening to sue.

30:25.699 --> 30:27.283
Sir, I'm very sorry.

30:45.636 --> 30:47.887
- Are you OK?
- How long was I out?

30:47.971 --> 30:51.307
I don't know, few minutes.
You slipped with all the rocks.

30:51.391 --> 30:53.184
- Ethan.
- What?

30:53.268 --> 30:55.520
- Ethan was here.
- You banged your head.

30:55.604 --> 30:58.731
- No, no. He was here.
- You have to stop.

30:58.815 --> 31:03.611
- The rain has washed away the trail.
- Even if he was here, you've got...

31:03.695 --> 31:06.781
- I'm not letting him do this.
- Not letting him?

31:07.241 --> 31:09.033
Not again.

31:10.118 --> 31:12.537
She had massive internal hemorrhaging.

31:12.621 --> 31:17.917
We realized that her blood pressure
was continuing to drop precipitously.

31:18.001 --> 31:21.045
At which point, the patient
went into cardiac arrest.

31:21.964 --> 31:25.341
Of course, every effort was
made to resuscitate her,

31:25.425 --> 31:27.385
but the severity of her injuries,

31:27.469 --> 31:29.929
the amount of internal bleeding

31:30.013 --> 31:31.639
made that impossible.

31:32.724 --> 31:35.518
In my professional opinion,
ladies and gentlemen,

31:35.602 --> 31:38.062
and that's all I have...

31:38.146 --> 31:40.356
...by the time I was called in,

31:40.440 --> 31:43.526
the damage was irreversible.

31:45.320 --> 31:47.071
OK. Thanks, Christian.

31:47.155 --> 31:49.991
- Sorry about this formality.
- Of course.

31:50.075 --> 31:53.619
Just one final detail. You were aware
of the patient's pregnancy

31:53.704 --> 31:56.581
- when you went into the procedure?
- Absolutely.

31:56.665 --> 32:00.751
The patient's husband had informed
the attending in the ER.

32:00.836 --> 32:03.546
It was, however, extremely early
in the pregnancy

32:03.630 --> 32:07.341
so our primary focus
had to be on the mother.

32:11.221 --> 32:14.265
OK, I think we're done here.
Our final report will be filed.

32:14.349 --> 32:15.766
OK.

32:17.769 --> 32:20.021
I need to...

32:21.940 --> 32:24.650
...revise my statement.

32:30.449 --> 32:33.242
I didn't come in
until well into the procedure.

32:33.327 --> 32:34.577
Jack.

32:34.661 --> 32:36.787
I was warned by one of the nurses

32:36.872 --> 32:39.206
that my father was operating...

32:40.959 --> 32:43.919
- ...under the influence.
- Jack, this is not...

32:44.004 --> 32:46.631
By the time I got there,
it was clear my father

32:46.715 --> 32:50.259
was not only incapacitated,
but that he had also...

32:50.344 --> 32:53.679
...severed the patient's hepatic artery,

32:53.764 --> 32:56.557
which, in my professional opinion,

32:58.226 --> 33:01.896
caused the crisis
which led to her death.

33:31.510 --> 33:32.760
No!

33:35.681 --> 33:37.473
You gotta cut him down.

33:46.566 --> 33:48.943
Hold on, Charlie. Hold on there.

34:05.293 --> 34:07.128
I can't reach!

34:07.212 --> 34:08.754
Pull him over!

34:13.135 --> 34:14.760
Harder!

34:34.072 --> 34:36.197
He's not breathing.

34:50.630 --> 34:52.422
Come on, breathe.

34:52.507 --> 34:54.007
Breathe, Charlie, come on.

34:54.092 --> 34:55.842
Breathe!

34:57.304 --> 35:07.229
Come on.

35:09.357 --> 35:10.399
Come on!

35:18.074 --> 35:20.034
Come on.

35:28.877 --> 35:30.795
Come on, Charlie!

35:31.838 --> 35:34.048
Come on.

35:34.132 --> 35:36.550
Come on, Charlie.

35:55.529 --> 35:57.863
Jack, he's... Jack, stop.

35:57.948 --> 36:00.449
He's not coming...

36:27.602 --> 36:30.437
It's OK.

36:33.441 --> 36:35.943
No.

36:36.027 --> 36:38.821
- Jack!
- Come on.

36:38.905 --> 36:41.615
- Stop!
- Come on.

37:00.343 --> 37:02.887
Yeah. Just breathe.

37:02.971 --> 37:05.639
Breathe. That's it.

37:07.684 --> 37:10.185
Just breathe. Just breathe deep.
Breathe deep.

37:18.570 --> 37:21.989
There you are. You're OK.

37:39.966 --> 37:41.342
Dad!

37:45.680 --> 37:49.558
They brought Charlie back, but he
hasn't said anything since he came back.

37:54.564 --> 37:56.357
They find Claire?

38:09.329 --> 38:11.205
Does that hurt?

38:13.124 --> 38:15.042
How's your breathing?

38:19.714 --> 38:21.131
Charlie.

38:21.216 --> 38:23.467
You gotta talk to me.

38:27.347 --> 38:31.183
We're gonna go look for Claire
the moment the sun comes up.

38:31.267 --> 38:33.894
And I could really use your help.

38:33.979 --> 38:37.648
I mean, anything that
you can tell me about...

38:37.732 --> 38:40.985
...what you remember,
where you were going.

38:41.069 --> 38:44.488
Did you see or hear...

38:44.572 --> 38:46.740
I didn't see anything.

38:49.369 --> 38:51.120
Hear anything.

38:55.208 --> 38:58.043
I don't remember...

39:00.171 --> 39:01.839
...anything.

39:05.760 --> 39:08.053
Claire.

39:09.347 --> 39:10.514
What?

39:12.058 --> 39:14.518
That's all they wanted.

39:15.478 --> 39:17.312
"They."

39:17.397 --> 39:20.441
All they wanted was Claire.

39:33.997 --> 39:35.622
They aren't back yet.

39:41.087 --> 39:43.297
I'm sure they just made camp
for the night.

39:45.967 --> 39:50.054
If there's anyone on this island
your brother's safe with, it's Locke.

39:52.432 --> 39:54.224
Are we lost?

39:55.310 --> 39:57.770
No, Boone, we're not lost.

39:57.854 --> 39:59.605
Sorry, it's just...

39:59.689 --> 40:03.776
I don't see how you can still
be following his trail.

40:05.862 --> 40:07.946
I think we should go back, man.

40:09.032 --> 40:12.159
- Don't you feel it?
- Feel what?

40:12.243 --> 40:13.994
It.

40:17.165 --> 40:19.374
All right, John...

40:21.002 --> 40:24.838
- I'm gonna follow the strips back.
- Suit yourself.

40:29.928 --> 40:32.346
You need this more than I do.

40:44.359 --> 40:46.401
What is that?

40:55.036 --> 40:56.578
Steel.

40:56.663 --> 40:58.497
Could that be part of the plane?

41:00.166 --> 41:01.792
Part of the wreckage?

41:15.765 --> 41:17.558
What is that?

41:19.018 --> 41:21.103
That's what we're gonna find out.
