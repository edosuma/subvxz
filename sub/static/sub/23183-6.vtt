00:10.366 --> 00:12.466
You were trying to figure out
WTF.

00:12.500 --> 00:15.100
with your BFFs
the other day...

00:17.366 --> 00:19.100
‐You guys ever sexted?
‐No

00:19.133 --> 00:20.333
All the times.

00:20.366 --> 00:22.233
‐Do you really?
‐Daily.

00:22.266 --> 00:23.966
I'm a bit surprised at you,
Squirrely Dan.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
It's all above water,
I assure's you.

00:26.033 --> 00:29.033
I'm on a telephone application's
called Bumble.

00:29.066 --> 00:30.533
It's kind of like Tinder

00:30.566 --> 00:33.100
except only the women's
can initiate conversations.

00:33.133 --> 00:34.300
So, what, they just message you

00:34.333 --> 00:35.466
up on your telephone
to sex talk?

00:35.500 --> 00:37.200
Sex text. Correct.

00:37.233 --> 00:38.433
Terrific.

00:38.466 --> 00:41.966
I think I've been sexting
with a gal, but not too sure.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
Well, what did she sext ya?

00:43.266 --> 00:44.233
LOL.

00:44.266 --> 00:46.833
What did you sext her
directly before that?

00:46.866 --> 00:48.000
Well, I asked her if
she wanted to go on a date.

00:48.033 --> 00:49.066
That's not sexting.

00:49.100 --> 00:50.400
‐Sure's it is.
‐No, it isn't.

00:50.433 --> 00:51.833
Dary asked a gal
to go on the date

00:51.866 --> 00:53.266
and she texted back LOL's.

00:53.300 --> 00:54.200
Yes, so it appears as though

00:54.233 --> 00:55.900
that's what went down,
Squirrely Dan.

00:55.933 --> 00:57.366
Well, that means,
"Lots of love".

00:57.400 --> 00:59.000
‐No it doesn't.
‐Sure's it does.

00:59.033 --> 01:01.900
No it doesn't. LOL means,
"Laughing out loud".

01:01.933 --> 01:02.966
So?

01:03.000 --> 01:04.300
So one of two things,
super chief.

01:04.333 --> 01:06.400
Number A, she thinks
the very thought

01:06.433 --> 01:08.233
of going
on a date with you is laughable.

01:08.266 --> 01:09.933
Or number B, the fact that
you'd think

01:09.966 --> 01:12.033
she'd want to go
on a date with you is laughable.

01:12.066 --> 01:13.133
Either way you're hooped.

01:13.166 --> 01:14.200
So?

01:14.233 --> 01:15.433
So she's laughing at you, bud.

01:15.466 --> 01:18.266
So it's...not sexting?

01:18.300 --> 01:19.333
Figure it out.

01:19.366 --> 01:21.133
Maybe she meant, "Lots of load".

01:21.633 --> 01:23.533
You wanna know what?

01:23.566 --> 01:25.600
That's the problem
with sexting

01:25.633 --> 01:27.566
and texting
or technology in general.

01:27.600 --> 01:30.433
The world needs less Facebook
and more face‐to‐face.

01:30.466 --> 01:31.900
More than a bit
fuckin' embarrassing,

01:31.933 --> 01:33.100
we're all sitting around here

01:33.133 --> 01:34.833
trying decipher what
three letters might mean.

01:34.866 --> 01:37.000
I'm sensing a bit
of hostility here, big shoots.

01:37.033 --> 01:39.366
Wanna know how my Uncle Ed
met my Aunt Mary?

01:39.400 --> 01:42.266
Walked right up to her,
like a sock hop.

01:42.300 --> 01:43.600
Told her
he thought she was pretty.

01:43.633 --> 01:45.200
Uncle Eddie's was a legend.

01:45.233 --> 01:46.233
Aunt Marian, too.

01:46.266 --> 01:48.266
Then he asked her if she
wanted to dance with him.

01:48.300 --> 01:49.566
Like, if she wanted to twist.

01:49.600 --> 01:50.966
I bet you he swing‐danced her.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.166
(SNICKERING)
Before he ballroomed 'er.

01:52.200 --> 01:54.433
And she walks over to her
gal pals and they're all saying,

01:54.466 --> 01:56.233
"How about the balls
on this sailor.

01:56.266 --> 01:59.133
Walks right up to a pretty girl
like you asking for a twist."

01:59.166 --> 02:00.300
Of course they're all
green with envy

02:00.333 --> 02:02.000
because no one's
asked them to twist.

02:02.033 --> 02:03.600
That sounds like
Uncle Eddie's all right.

02:03.633 --> 02:05.833
Yeah, sounds like par for
the course for Uncle Eddie.

02:05.866 --> 02:08.866
Don't you think it ends there.
It doesn't.

02:08.900 --> 02:11.333
Guess who walks into the
sock hop like he owns the place?

02:11.366 --> 02:14.000
Elvis Presley.
King of rock 'n' roll.

02:14.033 --> 02:14.966
Walks right up to Aunt Mary

02:15.000 --> 02:16.233
and says he ain't nothin'
but a hound dog.

02:16.266 --> 02:18.100
Oh. Tight spot
for Uncle Eddie's.

02:18.133 --> 02:19.166
What did Uncle Eddie do?

02:19.200 --> 02:20.400
Uncle Eddie? Walks right over

02:20.433 --> 02:22.900
to the King of Rock 'n' Roll
and puts him on his ass.

02:22.933 --> 02:24.966
‐Wow.
‐Uncle Eddie.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.500
Next thing you know, in walks
the Rat Pack

02:26.533 --> 02:28.066
with Chuck Berry
and the Beach Boys

02:28.100 --> 02:29.266
who hadn't broken yet but were

02:29.300 --> 02:31.433
making a name for themselves
as California street toughs.

02:31.466 --> 02:33.600
Guess what...
all good buddies with Elvis.

02:33.633 --> 02:35.600
‐No.
‐He's a goner. Gotta be.

02:35.633 --> 02:37.066
Think again.

02:37.100 --> 02:38.566
Uncle Eddie gets a tap
on his shoulder,

02:38.600 --> 02:41.566
a voice says to him he says,
"Hey, kid. Need a hand?"

02:41.600 --> 02:42.933
Guess who?

02:44.100 --> 02:45.333
You ever heard of Johnny Cash?

02:45.366 --> 02:47.000
Well, now
you're spinning's a yarn.

02:47.033 --> 02:48.333
The Man In Black himself?

02:48.366 --> 02:50.266
You better believe
it's the Man In Black.

02:50.300 --> 02:52.300
He's with his good pals
John Wayne and James Brown

02:52.333 --> 02:53.966
who don't take shit off anybody.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.166
Everybody knows that.

02:55.200 --> 02:56.233
You gonna throw hands
at James Brown,

02:56.266 --> 02:58.233
I'm sorry you're a goner.
Everybody knows that.

02:58.266 --> 02:59.900
But they're still outnumbered.

02:59.933 --> 03:01.533
So guess who shimmies over
in a real bad mood?

03:01.566 --> 03:02.600
Who?

03:02.633 --> 03:03.833
Little Richard. Gotta be.

03:03.866 --> 03:06.200
Hey, you better fuckin' believe
it's Little Richard.

03:06.233 --> 03:07.966
He's with his good pal
Bing Crosby.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.333
That's Pre‐White Christmas

03:09.366 --> 03:11.133
when he was still on
the bottle and a nasty drunk.

03:11.166 --> 03:12.433
So you know it's on now.

03:12.466 --> 03:15.200
Number one selling albums
of all‐times, <i>White Christmas.</i>

03:15.233 --> 03:17.933
Uh, that's
Pre ‐White Christmas. Look out.

03:17.966 --> 03:19.266
So fuckin' Buddy Holly
walks over

03:19.300 --> 03:21.033
and Bertuzzi's
Uncle Eddie, right?

03:21.066 --> 03:22.100
Next thing you know,

03:22.133 --> 03:23.866
Ray Charles has got
Buddy Holly in a rear naked.

03:23.900 --> 03:25.466
Buddy Holly's tappin',
Ray Charles says,

03:25.500 --> 03:27.833
"No way.
It's not how this ends."

03:27.866 --> 03:30.000
Cash is over there
arm‐barring Sinatra.

03:30.033 --> 03:32.333
Sammy Davis Jr. switched sides
halfway through the fight,

03:32.366 --> 03:34.233
he's got Dean Martin
in an Omoplata.

03:34.266 --> 03:35.366
Well, where's Uncle Eddie?

03:35.400 --> 03:37.300
Well, what's he gonna do?
He's gotta do something.

03:37.333 --> 03:38.900
Uncle Eddie's
freshly transitioned

03:38.933 --> 03:41.100
from a triangle choke
in favor of a full mount.

03:41.133 --> 03:42.366
He's got Brian Wilson down

03:42.400 --> 03:45.100
ready to serve the final blow
and someone catches his fist.

03:45.133 --> 03:46.266
Guess who?

03:46.300 --> 03:47.466
Johnny Cash.

03:47.500 --> 03:48.933
Says, "Hey, kid.

03:48.966 --> 03:51.566
We got this from here.
Go get your girl."

03:52.633 --> 03:53.500
Uncle Eddie gets up,

03:53.533 --> 03:55.133
John Wayne gives him
a tap on the butt

03:55.166 --> 03:57.066
like they're old
locker room pals.

03:57.100 --> 03:58.266
Well,
what's Aunt Marion's doing?

03:58.300 --> 03:59.133
Did he go over to her?

03:59.166 --> 04:03.100
Tell you what.
She went to him, okay.

04:03.133 --> 04:05.600
He scoops her up in his arms,
fireman carries her out of there

04:05.633 --> 04:07.066
to applause
from the sock hoppers

04:07.100 --> 04:08.433
who clear a path for them.

04:08.466 --> 04:09.600
Takes her for
a fuckin' milkshake.

04:09.633 --> 04:11.366
Like a real man.

04:11.400 --> 04:13.466
‐Wow.
‐Uncle Eddie.

04:13.500 --> 04:15.266
So next time you're
thinking about texting a girl

04:15.300 --> 04:17.266
to ask her out on a date,

04:17.300 --> 04:18.566
I want you to stop and think.

04:19.200 --> 04:21.300
About what?

04:21.333 --> 04:23.366
About the glory
you're leaving on the table.

04:24.533 --> 04:27.366
(PHONE BUZZING)

04:29.466 --> 04:30.566
Hey, it's her.

04:30.600 --> 04:31.800
Well, what she says?

04:35.300 --> 04:37.500
(READING) New phone. Who this?

04:40.200 --> 04:41.600
LOL.

04:41.633 --> 04:43.533
(MUSIC PLAYING)

04:53.600 --> 04:57.200
And that's why I never drink
out of Gino Reda's mug again.

04:57.233 --> 04:59.100
These sheets are just jibber...

04:59.133 --> 05:00.533
Oh, hi.
Welcome to Sports Centre.

05:00.566 --> 05:02.166
I'm Dan, he's Jay.

05:02.200 --> 05:03.333
Hello, Dan.

05:03.366 --> 05:06.000
A homegrown feel‐good story
to round out the program.

05:06.033 --> 05:08.600
Local hockey stars
Hudson and James Bay

05:08.633 --> 05:10.200
return from a stint in Europe

05:10.233 --> 05:14.100
to Letterkenny, Ontario...
to help their dad do hay.

05:14.133 --> 05:16.366
Now what's not to like
about that?

05:16.400 --> 05:17.966
Oh, boy.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.366
‐Toolesy?
‐Yeah.

05:19.400 --> 05:20.900
Letterkenny, Ontario.

05:20.933 --> 05:24.133
‐Problem, Toolesy?
‐No. No problem.

05:24.166 --> 05:25.200
Letterkenny, Ontario.

05:25.233 --> 05:27.866
Home of local hockey stars
Hudson and James Bay.

05:27.900 --> 05:30.566
Yeah. Yeah. You ever been
to Letterkenny, Jay?

05:30.600 --> 05:31.833
I've not had the pleasure, no.

05:31.866 --> 05:34.466
As you're aware by now,
I'm from Peterborough, Ontario.

05:34.500 --> 05:35.900
‐Yes, I'm aware.
‐Okay.

05:35.933 --> 05:37.066
You're familiar
with brawls in hockey.

05:37.100 --> 05:38.233
Yes, I'm familiar.

05:38.266 --> 05:39.366
Yeah,
they happen all the time.

05:39.400 --> 05:41.100
How about brawls in curling?

05:41.133 --> 05:42.166
That's a new one!

05:42.200 --> 05:43.266
Okay, that's what happened when

05:43.300 --> 05:45.133
Letterkenny's curling team
came to Peterborough.

05:45.166 --> 05:46.466
‐A curling brawl?
‐Yeah.

05:46.500 --> 05:47.600
A brawl at a curling match.

05:47.633 --> 05:49.100
You ever heard of
a cribbage brawl?

05:49.133 --> 05:50.033
More new territory...

05:50.066 --> 05:51.400
Yeah,
that's what happened routinely

05:51.433 --> 05:53.933
when members
of the Letterkenny Legion

05:53.966 --> 05:55.166
came and played
cribbage tournaments

05:55.200 --> 05:56.966
against members
of the Peterborough Legion.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.133
A cribbage brawl?

05:58.166 --> 05:59.966
Yeah. A brawl
at a cribbage tournament.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.266
Toolesy...

06:01.300 --> 06:03.333
You think I'm making
this crap up?

06:03.366 --> 06:04.866
So what are you
sayin' here, Toolesy?

06:04.900 --> 06:07.400
Okay, just if I were Hudson
and James Bay...

06:07.433 --> 06:08.266
Home to do hay.

06:08.300 --> 06:11.866
Yeah, yeah.
I'd be staying in Europe.

06:16.400 --> 06:18.066
Are you ready for this
old goat to make your day?

06:18.100 --> 06:19.333
Okay.

06:19.366 --> 06:21.500
Guess who's coming
to visit us this weekend?

06:22.600 --> 06:24.133
‐No way.
‐Way.

06:24.166 --> 06:26.066
‐No way. For hay?
‐For hay.

06:26.100 --> 06:28.100
‐No way.
‐All the way.

06:28.133 --> 06:29.933
‐Who did they say?
‐Well, they didn't, did they?

06:29.966 --> 06:31.000
Well, not yet anyway.

06:31.033 --> 06:32.166
So go ahead and say.

06:32.200 --> 06:34.066
James and Hudson.

06:34.100 --> 06:35.300
‐Bay?
‐Bay.

06:35.333 --> 06:36.933
James and Hudson Bay.

06:36.966 --> 06:38.433
‐No way.
‐Way.

06:38.466 --> 06:39.933
‐Home to stay?
‐Just for hay.

06:39.966 --> 06:41.066
You don't say.

06:41.100 --> 06:42.900
Well, you know, a little bit
of work,

06:42.933 --> 06:44.500
‐little bit of play.
‐Hooray.

06:44.533 --> 06:46.366
James and Hudson Bay.

06:46.400 --> 06:47.833
Hicks all the way.

06:47.866 --> 06:49.233
ALL: All the way.

06:49.266 --> 06:50.233
Oh, look. There's a stray.

06:50.266 --> 06:54.566
Those guys are LOL.
Legends of Letterkenny.

06:54.600 --> 06:55.900
Good workers, too.

06:55.933 --> 06:56.866
Well, they're great workers.

06:56.900 --> 06:58.266
They put away bales
with the best of them.

06:58.300 --> 06:59.866
Faster than a fox over a fence.

06:59.900 --> 07:01.500
James and Hudson Bay.

07:01.533 --> 07:02.600
You wanna know what?

07:02.633 --> 07:04.333
The brothers Bay home for hay

07:04.366 --> 07:06.200
is a chance for all of us
to come together

07:06.233 --> 07:09.200
and show 'em we're proud
in our own special way.

07:09.233 --> 07:10.966
So, stick with tradition?

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
Well, you don't
fuck with tradition.

07:12.033 --> 07:14.400
Puppers and a pig roast
for the brothers Bay.

07:14.433 --> 07:15.633
Puppers and a pig.

07:15.666 --> 07:17.300
All right well, I'm gonna go
talk to Tanis about the pig.

07:17.333 --> 07:18.933
You get them
cheapest on the Rez.

07:18.966 --> 07:20.233
Okay, Katy. Okay.

07:20.266 --> 07:21.333
Okay, Dary. Okay.

07:21.366 --> 07:22.600
Okay, Dan. Okay.

07:22.633 --> 07:23.600
‐Okay, stray.
‐(CAT MEWING)

07:23.633 --> 07:26.266
But what are we gonna
call the party this year?

07:26.300 --> 07:27.900
‐Hay Days.
‐No.

07:27.933 --> 07:29.900
‐A Bay in the Life.
‐We're gettin' warmer.

07:29.933 --> 07:31.966

07:32.000 --> 07:35.033
Wait!
Great day for Bay.

07:35.066 --> 07:36.466

‐Yeah.

07:36.500 --> 07:37.600
Yup.

07:37.633 --> 07:40.100
ALL: Great Day for Bay.

07:40.133 --> 07:42.233
Will somebody help me

07:42.266 --> 07:44.466
Oh, shit, it's gettin' away.

07:44.500 --> 07:46.933

07:46.966 --> 07:48.833

PIMS and plus/minus.

07:59.266 --> 08:00.866
Now they're playing in Europe.

08:00.900 --> 08:03.400
Imagine all the Amserdamsels

08:03.433 --> 08:04.600
Be wheelin' abroad all right.

08:04.633 --> 08:05.933
International ass.

08:05.966 --> 08:07.033
Getting their ass ports stamped.

08:07.066 --> 08:09.233
Oh, they're part of
the European Poonion now, buddy.

08:09.266 --> 08:10.600
Traveling through
Titaly for sure.

08:10.633 --> 08:12.333
Seeing all kind of Vati‐cans.

08:12.366 --> 08:14.166
Nice mountains
in Titzerland, too.

08:14.200 --> 08:16.066
Hammerin' all the Croati‐ass.

08:16.100 --> 08:17.900
Smashin' all that Romani‐ass.

08:17.933 --> 08:19.900
Slam crushin'
all that Albani‐ass.

08:19.933 --> 08:21.466
Oh, welcome to Bulge‐aria.

08:21.500 --> 08:24.033

08:24.066 --> 08:27.100
All the way.
Droppin' mitts and suckin' tits.

08:27.133 --> 08:29.266
‐Titty validity.
‐Titty stupidity.

08:29.300 --> 08:31.200
‐Home this weekend, buddy.
‐Home this weekend, bro.

08:31.233 --> 08:32.900
Gotta do something epic.

08:32.933 --> 08:35.266
How are we going to top All Bay,
All Night from last year?

08:35.300 --> 08:38.300
Fuck! That drew more box
than an architect.

08:38.333 --> 08:39.433
They'll come up with something.

08:39.466 --> 08:41.000
Where there's a will
there's a Bay.

08:41.033 --> 08:42.533
Europe! Europe!

08:44.500 --> 08:49.133
Bay Brothers.
Egotistical egotesticles.

08:49.166 --> 08:50.433
Stewart! They're your family.

08:50.466 --> 08:51.933
‐Questionable.
‐Undeniable.

08:51.966 --> 08:53.133
Unverifiable.

08:53.166 --> 08:54.466
Stewart, they're your cousins.

08:54.500 --> 08:55.966
There's pictures of you
and the Bays

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
together as kids
all over your house.

08:57.033 --> 08:59.100
‐My mum's house.
‐Well, you still live there.

08:59.133 --> 09:00.533
Roald...

09:00.566 --> 09:03.200
Stewart...it is verifiable.

09:03.233 --> 09:06.833
This is not a Bay Pride parade.

09:06.866 --> 09:09.566
Those Baystards never wanted
to hang out with me anyway.

09:09.600 --> 09:13.233
I'm nauseated by their
hokey hockey hickey shit.

09:13.266 --> 09:16.333
I do not want to spend more time
down by the Bay.

09:16.366 --> 09:18.133
‐Where the watermelons...
‐Grow up!

09:22.566 --> 09:25.200
Hi. What's your name?

09:25.233 --> 09:26.966
‐Zack.
‐Zack.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.366
‐Russell Terrier.
‐Zack Russell Terrier?

09:29.400 --> 09:30.933
Present.

09:30.966 --> 09:34.033
We're having a Bay‐B‐Q
this weekend,

09:34.066 --> 09:36.100
'cause the Bay brothers Bay
are coming home.

09:36.133 --> 09:38.266
James and Hudson.
Do you know them?

09:38.300 --> 09:39.933
‐We're second cousins.
‐Oh.

09:39.966 --> 09:41.433
Their uncle Cal
married my Aunt Sue.

09:41.466 --> 09:42.600
Oh, which one's a Bay?

09:42.633 --> 09:44.533
Aunt Sue was a Bay
before she was a Casa.

09:45.500 --> 09:47.466
So now she's Sue Casa?

09:47.500 --> 09:50.933
Married Calvin Garfield Casa.
Goes by Cal Gary.

09:50.966 --> 09:53.600
You might know their kids,
Sam and Ella.

09:53.633 --> 09:55.066
Salmonella?

09:55.100 --> 09:57.333
Yeah, Sam and Ella
have a half‐brother Ty, as well.

09:57.866 --> 09:59.333
Ty Casa.

09:59.366 --> 10:01.900
I said half‐brother.
His last name's Food.

10:01.933 --> 10:02.933
Ty Food?

10:03.400 --> 10:04.500
Present.

10:04.533 --> 10:05.833
Jesus.

10:05.866 --> 10:07.066
What's your name?

10:07.366 --> 10:08.400
Katy.

10:08.433 --> 10:09.333
Katy what?

10:09.366 --> 10:12.433
Wait...you know my half brother,
Ash, right?

10:12.466 --> 10:14.900
‐Ash who?
‐Wednesday.

10:14.933 --> 10:17.200
‐Ash Wednesday?
‐Mm‐Hmm, that's him.

10:17.233 --> 10:18.366
Hangs out with the Books.

10:18.400 --> 10:21.166
‐The Books?
‐Art and Mac.

10:21.200 --> 10:23.466
‐Art Book and Mac Book?
‐Yeah.

10:24.200 --> 10:25.333
Know them?

10:25.366 --> 10:26.833
Are you fucking with me?

10:26.866 --> 10:28.833
No!

10:28.866 --> 10:31.966
Zack Russell Terrier and Ty Food
ain't fuckin' with you.

10:33.600 --> 10:34.600
What's with the pig?

10:34.633 --> 10:36.866
The brothers Bay
are coming home this weekend,

10:36.900 --> 10:39.866
so Saturday we're going
to Bay Bash. Big Bay‐B‐Q.

10:39.900 --> 10:41.133
Oh, yeah? What's it called?

10:41.166 --> 10:43.066
Great Day for Bay.

10:43.100 --> 10:45.533
Nice.
Points for Bay Bash as well.

10:45.566 --> 10:46.933
It's too bad, though.

10:46.966 --> 10:48.066
What's too bad?

10:48.100 --> 10:49.033
Well, the Bay Brothers

10:49.066 --> 10:50.900
are coming to the Rez
on Saturday for a party.

10:50.933 --> 10:52.500
They're part native all the way.

10:52.533 --> 10:54.966
But, Great Day for Bay.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.033
Yeah but, we already got
$1,000 on fireworks.

10:58.066 --> 11:01.100
Thunder Bay. Saturday. Hmm?

11:02.933 --> 11:06.400
Hey, Zack Russell Terrier
and Ty Food are going to come.

11:06.433 --> 11:07.933
Maybe you'll come, too.

11:19.100 --> 11:21.533
‐Hey.
‐That's barley.

11:21.566 --> 11:23.166
‐Okay.
‐How are you now?

11:23.200 --> 11:24.933
You should stand down
on Great Day for Bay.

11:25.300 --> 11:26.466
What?

11:26.500 --> 11:28.000
The Bay Brothers are coming
to the Rez for Thunder Bay.

11:28.033 --> 11:29.166
They're part native all the way.

11:29.200 --> 11:30.900
They're full hick all the way.

11:30.933 --> 11:33.066
Plus we already purchased
the pig from your people.

11:33.100 --> 11:34.400
Yeah, but do you's
even know how to cook it?

11:34.433 --> 11:36.066
Throw it on a spit and rotate.

11:36.100 --> 11:37.266
Don't threaten me
with a good time.

11:37.300 --> 11:38.466
Okay.

11:38.500 --> 11:40.233
What about when you insert
the thermometer

11:40.266 --> 11:41.933
to check
the temperature inside?

11:41.966 --> 11:44.333
‐What about it?
‐I don't know. You tell me.

11:44.366 --> 11:46.233
Here's the scoop.
We've already planned the party.

11:46.266 --> 11:48.533
Yeah, but we've already spent
$1,000 on fireworks.

11:48.566 --> 11:50.066
I don't want to see that
go up in smoke.

11:50.100 --> 11:51.400
‐Up?
‐(SHRUGGING)

11:51.433 --> 11:52.666
‐What?
‐Nothing. Go ahead.

11:52.700 --> 11:54.833
Keeping in mind that you once
burnt down the produce stand,

11:54.866 --> 11:56.533
a lot has happened since then.

11:56.566 --> 11:58.866
The Brothers Bay home for hay
is the perfect opportunity

11:58.900 --> 12:01.333
for all of us to come together
and show them we're proud.

12:01.366 --> 12:05.300
So, we would like to invite
you and your friends here

12:05.333 --> 12:07.233
for Great Day for Bay.

12:07.266 --> 12:10.233
Or you can move your party
to the Rez for Thunder Bay.

12:10.266 --> 12:13.066
'Cause the Bay Brothers
are part native...all the way.

12:13.100 --> 12:15.300
They're full hick...
All the way.

12:16.100 --> 12:17.266
So...

12:19.466 --> 12:22.566
You trying to sneak a sunrise
past a rooster, Tanis?

12:22.600 --> 12:25.500
I don't know.
You're the one whose stuck
between a cock and hard place.

12:25.533 --> 12:27.166
You a breast or thigh guy?

12:31.066 --> 12:33.000
‐They're full hick.
‐Correct.

12:33.033 --> 12:34.266
And only part native.

12:34.300 --> 12:35.466
(SHRUGGING)
Splittin' hairs, but yeah.

12:35.500 --> 12:38.200
‐So we host.
‐Fair.

12:39.066 --> 12:40.400
But the name...

12:40.433 --> 12:42.466
‐Great Day for...
‐Uh...

12:42.500 --> 12:43.933
‐What?
‐What?

12:43.966 --> 12:45.900
‐Nothing. You go.
‐How's this?

12:45.933 --> 12:47.466
Great Day for Thunder Bay.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.933
Great Day for Thunder Bay!

12:49.966 --> 12:51.466
Puppers, pigs and pyrotechnics.

12:51.500 --> 12:53.100
Puppers, pigs, pyrotechnics
and pepperettes.

12:53.133 --> 12:54.133
Perfect.

12:54.166 --> 12:57.200
‐See you there, Wayne or shine.
‐Good enough.

12:57.233 --> 12:59.500
There'll be fireworks,
just like old times.

12:59.533 --> 13:01.866
It's been a business doing
pleasure with you, Tanis.

13:01.900 --> 13:04.833
So, what about
that elusive girl of yours?

13:04.866 --> 13:06.133
She gonna show her face
for once?

13:06.166 --> 13:07.333
None of your beeswax.

13:07.366 --> 13:09.533
‐People are talkin' you know.
‐None of their beeswax.

13:09.566 --> 13:10.900
Doesn't bother you?

13:12.866 --> 13:15.100
Mind your beeswax, Tanis.

13:15.133 --> 13:18.100
Hmm . Later, boo.

13:28.300 --> 13:30.166
We tried to come up
with our own party

13:30.200 --> 13:32.066
for the Bay Brothers, but...

13:32.100 --> 13:33.933
You's are welcome
to come to our party.

13:33.966 --> 13:35.233
Wanna know what?
The Brothers Bay home for hay

13:35.266 --> 13:36.466
is a chance for all of us

13:36.500 --> 13:40.033
to come together
and show 'em we're proud.

13:40.066 --> 13:41.900
Yeah. We know. It was just...

13:41.933 --> 13:43.366
Just that everyone keeps

13:43.400 --> 13:45.066
coming up with cool names
for their Bay parties

13:45.100 --> 13:47.833
and all we could come up with
was Bay There Delilah.

13:47.866 --> 13:49.533
Bay Jude was a runner up.

13:49.566 --> 13:51.400
And honorable mention,
Independence Bay.

13:51.433 --> 13:52.400
Yeah,

13:52.433 --> 13:54.466
Bay the Earth Stood Still
was also a contender.

13:54.500 --> 13:57.000
Shout out to Glory Bays.

13:57.033 --> 13:59.500
But,
credit where credit's due...

13:59.533 --> 14:02.200
Great Day for Bay
cannot be beaten.

14:02.233 --> 14:05.366
So, we'd love to come
to your Bay‐B‐Q.

14:05.400 --> 14:07.866
We just told you
that you're invited.

14:07.900 --> 14:09.500
Fuck, we just fuckin' said!

14:09.533 --> 14:11.100
You know what, the Brothers Bay
home for hay

14:11.133 --> 14:12.366
is a chance for all of us

14:12.400 --> 14:14.466
to come together

14:15.133 --> 14:16.166
Nice.

14:16.200 --> 14:17.833
We're invited.

14:17.866 --> 14:19.133
‐Sick, boys.
‐Sick.

14:19.166 --> 14:20.300
How can we help?

14:20.333 --> 14:21.933
Well, I haven't heard
form the Brothers Bay all day

14:21.966 --> 14:23.600
so safe to say
they're behind on hay.

14:23.633 --> 14:25.133
You should head on over.

14:25.166 --> 14:27.300
‐Lend us a hand.
‐Done.

14:27.333 --> 14:29.400
Just like liftin' hockey bags,
right boys?

14:29.433 --> 14:30.433
On par.

14:30.466 --> 14:32.233
Lift with your legs
not your back, right boys?

14:32.266 --> 14:33.433
Why don't you try both

14:33.466 --> 14:34.966
and see which one
works out betters for ya?

14:35.000 --> 14:36.333
You'll wanna throw on some pants

14:36.366 --> 14:38.033
or else
you carve your legs all up.

14:38.066 --> 14:39.866
Bring some fuckin' Puppers too.

14:39.900 --> 14:41.066
Pitter patter.

14:41.100 --> 14:43.866
‐Not gonna do the pants, man.
‐Yeah. Go get beer though.

14:48.133 --> 14:49.200
(CAR ENGINE STARTING)

14:52.266 --> 14:55.500
Yes, Stewart you can come
to Great Day for Bay.

14:55.533 --> 14:57.400
‐Bay‐arf.
‐Pardon?

14:57.433 --> 14:58.966
Great day for barf.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.433
So I take it
you won't be coming here then.

15:01.466 --> 15:03.366
Oh, we'll be there.

15:03.400 --> 15:05.300
To laugh
at what losers they are.

15:05.333 --> 15:06.366
(LAUGHING)

15:06.400 --> 15:08.300
Bring some fuckin' Puppers.

15:09.200 --> 15:11.100
Yeah...

15:11.133 --> 15:13.000
Okay, cool. Bye.

15:15.400 --> 15:18.366
They never wanted
to hang out with me anyway.

15:18.400 --> 15:21.233
Time to make those idiots Bay.

15:21.266 --> 15:22.266
What does that mean?

15:23.433 --> 15:26.066
The expression is,
"make them pay".

15:26.100 --> 15:28.500
I replaced their last name
to be clever.

15:28.533 --> 15:32.933
Oh. Oh yeah, I know.
That's super...super clever.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.900
You try!

15:35.933 --> 15:42.033
Okay. Uh, go ahead, make my Bay!

15:43.933 --> 15:45.833
Satisfactory.

15:48.100 --> 15:50.933
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

16:03.366 --> 16:04.833
What's up?

16:04.866 --> 16:05.733
How're you now?

16:05.766 --> 16:06.966
Smokin' darts
and breakin' hearts.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.333
‐You bring the fireworks?
‐That was the deal wasn't it?

16:09.366 --> 16:10.966
‐Can confirm.
‐She here?

16:11.000 --> 16:12.566
Have a fuckin' Puppers.

16:17.400 --> 16:20.100
Hey. You wanna see the pig?

16:20.133 --> 16:21.233
Solid opening.

16:21.266 --> 16:23.433
I checked
and it's my cousin Ed
who knows you.

16:23.466 --> 16:26.100
‐Oh, Ed who?
‐Ed Monton.

16:26.133 --> 16:28.433
Yeah. Yeah.
He's friends with my buddy Mike.

16:28.466 --> 16:30.066
‐Which Mike?
‐Check.

16:30.400 --> 16:31.533
For sure.

16:31.566 --> 16:33.600
Ed Monton was Mike Check's
best man at his wedding.

16:33.633 --> 16:35.266
Told you they weren't
fuckin' with you.

16:35.300 --> 16:37.033
Fuckin' babes, eh?

16:39.133 --> 16:41.833
Great Day
for Thunder Bay, eh boys?

16:41.866 --> 16:42.800
Judging by your arms,

16:42.833 --> 16:43.700
doesn't like it was
that good of a day.

16:43.733 --> 16:45.933
Super great day
for Thunder Bay, boys.

16:45.966 --> 16:47.500
Got an inside look at hick life.

16:47.533 --> 16:49.833
Feels pretty good
to do some hard labor.

16:49.866 --> 16:52.300
‐Beats the fuckin' gym.
‐Yeah, gym fuckin' sucks, boys.

16:52.333 --> 16:54.333
Well, next time you'll know
to wear long sleeves and pants.

16:54.366 --> 16:55.866
Where's the Bays?

16:55.900 --> 16:57.166
Well,
according to their parents...

16:57.200 --> 16:58.500
‐George Ian?
‐Fanny's?

16:58.533 --> 16:59.700
George Ian Bay and Fanny Bay

16:59.733 --> 17:02.066
said Hudson and James Bay
went into town for a meeting.

17:02.100 --> 17:03.133
A meeting?

17:03.166 --> 17:04.433
Well, according to
George Ian Bay.

17:04.466 --> 17:05.500
Fanny Bay said she couldn't

17:05.533 --> 17:07.600
get a hold of James
or Hudson Bay all afternoon.

17:07.633 --> 17:08.733
You know what, buddy?

17:08.766 --> 17:11.000
I haven't been able to get
a hold of Big City Slams

17:11.033 --> 17:12.833
all afternoon either, buddy.

17:12.866 --> 17:14.533
Hey, you boys seen
those two gym babes?

17:14.566 --> 17:17.000
You know,
the two babes from the gym.

17:17.033 --> 17:18.233
Are they here?

17:18.266 --> 17:19.600
Don't think so boys.

17:19.633 --> 17:21.833
Couldn't get a hold
of those babes all afternoon.

17:24.166 --> 17:26.000
CROWD: It's them. It's them.

17:26.466 --> 17:29.833
(CROWD CHEERING)

17:33.466 --> 17:37.166
Well, Great Day for Thunder Bay,
fellows.

17:37.200 --> 17:40.133
(CHEERING)

17:40.166 --> 17:42.300
‐Welcome home.
‐Thanks Wayne.

17:42.333 --> 17:43.566
‐Welcome home.
‐Thanks Wayne.

17:43.600 --> 17:46.100
Brothers Bay home for hay
is a chance for us

17:46.133 --> 17:48.033
to show you guys
how proud we are of you.

17:48.066 --> 17:48.933
Thanks Katy.

17:48.966 --> 17:51.466
You guys made it
all the way to Europe.

17:51.500 --> 17:54.400
Welcome home, Hudson.
Got to tell us all about Europe.

17:54.433 --> 17:56.500
Welcome home, James.
Got to tell us all about Europe.

17:56.533 --> 17:57.800
We will. We will.

18:00.033 --> 18:03.266
In keeping with tradition
as promised, Puppers and pig.

18:03.300 --> 18:06.100
And pyrotechnics this year, too.

18:06.133 --> 18:07.400
Welcome home, pussies.

18:07.433 --> 18:08.433
‐Thanks, Tanis.
‐Thanks, Tanis.

18:08.466 --> 18:11.866
But say, what were you guys
doin' all day?

18:11.900 --> 18:13.400
BOTH: We had a meeting.

18:13.433 --> 18:16.066
Meeting?
Let's call a bay of pigs.

18:16.100 --> 18:17.366
There's that gym babe.

18:18.366 --> 18:20.166
There's that other gym babe.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.000
More like Guantanamo Bay.

18:22.033 --> 18:24.133
'Cause I didn't know whether
we were gonna get out alive.

18:26.900 --> 18:28.566
Hey, it's Big City Slams.

18:28.600 --> 18:30.300
Felt like I was on
Bays of Our Lives

18:30.333 --> 18:31.900
'cause there were
so many storylines

18:31.933 --> 18:33.400
going on all at once.

18:33.433 --> 18:35.433
Big City Slams 2, boys.

18:35.466 --> 18:37.533
I don't even know
what Bay it is.

18:39.500 --> 18:40.333
ALL: Angie.

18:40.366 --> 18:42.466
Never thought I'd be
into Bay sex.

18:42.500 --> 18:44.500
Thanks for
the Bay City Roll, boys.

18:44.533 --> 18:47.000
I'll be your Bay‐once any day.

18:49.366 --> 18:50.466
Well...

18:52.866 --> 18:54.033
LOL.

18:54.066 --> 18:56.533
(EVERYBODY LAUGHING)

18:56.566 --> 18:58.066
Is Stewart here?

19:02.200 --> 19:03.966
‐Hudson?
‐Stewart.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.200
‐James.
‐Stewart.

19:05.233 --> 19:06.933
Can we finally hang out?

19:06.966 --> 19:08.033
Hang out?

19:08.066 --> 19:10.233
Let's have a fuckin' Puppers.

19:10.266 --> 19:12.333
I'd love a fucking Puppers.

19:13.900 --> 19:16.366
I just always figured
you didn't want to.

19:16.400 --> 19:19.566
You know, the whole
hicks versus skids thing.

19:19.600 --> 19:21.833
They're hockey players
all the way, boys.

19:21.866 --> 19:23.400
Part native
all the way, too, boys

19:23.433 --> 19:25.166
‐We're family.
‐All the way.

19:26.533 --> 19:28.000
You guys do rips?

19:28.033 --> 19:30.000
BOTH: Hard no.

19:30.033 --> 19:32.400
‐But do you rip Chel?
‐'Cause we will rip Chel...

19:32.433 --> 19:34.433
‐Oh, Stewart.
‐Goddamn right I rip Chel.

19:34.466 --> 19:36.600
‐You guys got rips?
‐We got rips.

19:36.633 --> 19:38.200
They'll do rips.

19:38.233 --> 19:40.600
‐No rips.
‐But we'll rip Chel, boys.

19:40.633 --> 19:42.833
Are you boys talking about what
I think you're talking about?

19:42.866 --> 19:44.600
‐What if we are?
‐I'm calling the cops.

19:44.633 --> 19:48.166
ALL: No...

19:48.200 --> 19:49.933
Just kidding. Do some rips.

19:49.966 --> 19:51.533
We're gonna need more rips.

19:51.566 --> 19:54.533
‐I got rips.
‐Then it's on. Chel.

19:54.566 --> 19:56.533
You god damn right, it's on.

19:56.566 --> 19:58.866
‐Chel.
‐In rips.

19:58.900 --> 20:00.433
‐Chel.
‐In rips!

20:00.466 --> 20:02.466
(ALL CHANTING)
Chel. In rips!

20:02.500 --> 20:04.866
Chel. In rips!

20:04.900 --> 20:07.033
Chel. In rips!

20:11.200 --> 20:13.200
(CHEERING)

20:14.400 --> 20:16.466
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

20:26.433 --> 20:28.900
Hats off to Tanis, boys.

20:28.933 --> 20:31.066
She's certainly a great day
for Thunder Bay.

20:31.100 --> 20:33.166
Tanis has out done's herself.
