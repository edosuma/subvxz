01:06.232 --> 01:07.484
Yes?

01:07.567 --> 01:09.944
Does a full house beat four of a kind?

01:10.487 --> 01:13.865
Uh-uh. Sorry, Kenj. Not today, not ever.

01:13.948 --> 01:14.866
Aw, man!

01:15.700 --> 01:16.785
[Darius] Boom!

01:20.288 --> 01:22.040
Don't mean to interrupt all the fun,

01:22.123 --> 01:24.959
but if anyone wants to round up
some chestnuts from the forest,

01:25.043 --> 01:27.670
I make a pretty mean soup.

01:27.754 --> 01:30.465
I'll go. It's getting kinda boring
beating these guys.

02:28.189 --> 02:31.276
Huh? Oh, yeah. I'm good.

02:33.236 --> 02:34.988
I only ask because you gasped loudly,

02:35.071 --> 02:37.407
dropped my tablet to the floor,
then startled awake.

02:37.490 --> 02:38.324
[Yaz chuckles]

02:38.825 --> 02:40.201
-Sorry.
-[Dr. Turner] No, look.

02:40.285 --> 02:42.537
I appreciate you
keeping an eye out for BRADs,

02:42.620 --> 02:45.081
but you should rest,
like your friends over there.

But I'd rather stay up, if that's okay.

02:57.886 --> 02:58.928
You're the boss.

02:59.512 --> 03:00.930
[Dr. Turner]
Except when you're assisting me,

03:01.014 --> 03:02.557
then, obviously, I'm the boss.

03:03.182 --> 03:04.809
Now, hand me that petri dish.

[Dr. Turner] Oh, my…

03:20.617 --> 03:22.952
Oh, no, no, no. This is bad.

03:23.536 --> 03:26.164
Very, <i>very</i> bad.

03:28.541 --> 03:31.878
Okay, after careful analysis
of the nutriment samples,

03:31.961 --> 03:35.006
I've discovered alarmingly
high levels of receptor antagonists,

03:35.089 --> 03:36.507
as well as adrenal additives.

03:36.591 --> 03:39.719
These must be the cause of the elevated
combative state of the animals

03:39.802 --> 03:40.929
who've ingested them.

03:41.012 --> 03:43.139
Dude, what the heck is she talking about?

03:43.223 --> 03:44.057
Ugh!

03:44.140 --> 03:45.975
The T. rex food's been tampered with.

03:46.059 --> 03:48.686
They're adding things
that make the dinos more aggressive,

03:48.770 --> 03:51.231
and inhibits their ability to feel pain.

03:51.314 --> 03:54.442
-Mantah Corp is the worst.
-Why would they do that?

03:54.525 --> 03:55.485
I have no idea.

03:55.568 --> 03:58.655
But it seems more important than ever
to get you kids off the island.

04:00.114 --> 04:02.033
No argument here.
[coughs]

04:02.659 --> 04:04.035
Are you feeling okay?

04:04.118 --> 04:05.787
[clears throat]
Always.

04:05.870 --> 04:08.498
-Something just caught in my throat.
-[scoffs]

04:09.207 --> 04:12.043
Great.
Trying to get off yet another island.

04:12.126 --> 04:13.419
Any ideas?

04:14.128 --> 04:15.463
[gasps]
The supply plane!

04:15.546 --> 04:17.382
It comes every two weeks.

04:18.049 --> 04:20.843
Only, the next one's not due
for another ten days.

04:20.927 --> 04:22.428
We can't wait that long.

04:23.846 --> 04:25.139
Maybe we don't have to.

04:25.223 --> 04:27.016
Any way to make the plane come sooner?

04:27.100 --> 04:30.687
Well, I mean, I suppose it would come
if there was some kind of emergency.

04:30.770 --> 04:34.190
If we stop the dinos
from eating that messed-up food,

04:34.274 --> 04:36.150
Mantah Corp would notice, right?

04:36.234 --> 04:38.569
[Darius] Maybe we can kill two birds
with one stone.

04:38.653 --> 04:42.198
Get rid of the altered T. rex food,
and get the supply plane to come early!

04:42.282 --> 04:43.408
[clears throat]
Hang on.

04:43.491 --> 04:46.869
So, we're just gonna somehow
get this supply plane to come?

04:46.953 --> 04:52.292
All the while avoiding getting eaten
by dinosaurs or zapped by killer robots.

04:52.375 --> 04:54.585
Then we just sneak onboard,

04:54.669 --> 04:57.588
and hope that Mantah Corp
doesn't notice six kids on the plane

04:57.672 --> 04:59.090
until we're back home?

04:59.966 --> 05:01.759
Uh, yeah.

05:04.095 --> 05:05.680
Supply plane it is.

05:05.763 --> 05:09.475
Right. All we need is a solid,
detailed plan.

05:10.059 --> 05:11.561
[Dr. Turner] Hmm.

05:12.186 --> 05:15.273
Give me a minute,
I'm sure I'll come up with something.

05:15.356 --> 05:17.525
-Um, Mae?
-[Dr. Turner mumbling]

05:17.608 --> 05:20.737
I have an idea that could work.
Here's how it'll go down.

05:22.613 --> 05:25.199
[Darius] <i>First, we'll wait
until the T. rexes go to sleep.</i>

05:25.283 --> 05:28.661
<i>Mae, Ben, and Yaz will keep an eye on 'em
and make sure they stay that way.</i>

05:29.203 --> 05:31.331
[growls]

05:31.414 --> 05:33.458
<i>The minute they wake up,
you guys will alert--</i>

05:33.541 --> 05:35.501
Sorry, can I not be on dino duty?

05:37.587 --> 05:38.838
But you're the fastest.

05:38.921 --> 05:41.924
I know. Like, by a lot. But…

05:42.633 --> 05:45.428
I stayed up pretty late last night,
and I could use…

05:45.511 --> 05:46.387
a break.

05:49.807 --> 05:52.852
No prob. I'll be Team Dino.
[sneezes]

05:52.935 --> 05:54.645
Uh, are you catching a cold?

05:54.729 --> 05:56.731
Because the last thing
I need is to get sick.

05:56.814 --> 05:59.192
Me? Sick? No way!

05:59.275 --> 06:01.986
I'm a hundred percent, all day, every day.

06:02.820 --> 06:03.946
Okay.

06:04.030 --> 06:06.282
So, Kenji will keep an eye on the Rexes.

06:07.533 --> 06:11.120
[Darius] <i>Meanwhile, Brooklynn and Sammy
will get rid of the altered T. rex food.</i>

06:17.502 --> 06:21.047
<i>Finally, Yaz and I will move in
and disable the feeding platform,</i>

06:21.964 --> 06:24.801
<i>which will hopefully alert Mantah Corp
to send the supply plane</i>

06:24.884 --> 06:26.761
<i>so that the BRADs can repair it.</i>

06:29.013 --> 06:31.849
I thought Mae said there'd be
some sort of a power box nearby.

06:31.933 --> 06:34.185
It's gotta be here somewhere.
Keep looking.

[Dr. Turner] Oh, no!

medical attention by now.

Are you sure

12:36.046 --> 12:37.590
the heat's turned up all the way?

12:37.673 --> 12:39.925
Just relax and think of some place warm.

how to play poker like that?

12:53.355 --> 12:54.440
My mom.

12:54.523 --> 12:57.026
It was our favorite thing to do
on rainy days.

Well, you'll be seeing her very soon.

13:12.208 --> 13:13.918
I, I…

13:17.046 --> 13:19.507
I just, I felt a little car sick.

13:20.716 --> 13:21.842
Weird, huh?

13:23.928 --> 13:25.095
Not that weird.

13:26.639 --> 13:27.723
But that is.

13:30.100 --> 13:32.019

Pierce?

13:41.445 --> 13:43.405
Uh, I, I don't know what he is,

13:43.489 --> 13:46.242
but I'm, I'm pretty sure
he doesn't wanna be here.

13:46.325 --> 13:47.785
[continues growling]

13:49.411 --> 13:51.455
Pierce, what are you doing out here?

13:55.793 --> 13:59.088
That is a giant, pointy dinosaur
standing in front of us, right?

13:59.171 --> 14:03.092
It's a Kentrosaurus. They're herbivores.
The spikes are mostly for defense.

14:05.261 --> 14:07.680
-[thuds]
-[Dr. Turner] No! Pierce!

14:18.482 --> 14:22.945
He's gone into hypothermic shock.
I have to move him out of here somehow…

14:23.571 --> 14:24.822
Or he'll die.

14:24.905 --> 14:26.866

14:26.949 --> 14:30.244
What about the supply plane?
It's gonna be here in under an hour.

14:30.327 --> 14:31.829
-Yaz is right.
-[Pierce groaning]

14:31.912 --> 14:34.206
You kids take the gliders and keep going.

14:34.290 --> 14:37.877
I'll figure out a way to get Pierce back
into the desert biome where he belongs.

14:37.960 --> 14:40.546
You can't just move a 4,000-pound
dinosaur by yourself.

14:40.629 --> 14:42.923
How about some of us go ahead
and stall the plane,

14:43.007 --> 14:44.967
and the rest of us can stay back to help?

14:45.718 --> 14:48.679
The only way we'll move a dinosaur
that big is with both vehicles.

14:48.762 --> 14:51.432
If we're gonna save him,
we all have to help.

14:51.932 --> 14:53.017
We're in.

14:59.523 --> 15:02.985
Sure. I'm not gonna let Mantah Corp
hurt one more creature.

15:03.068 --> 15:06.447
Yeah. If something like this
ever happened to Bumpy…

15:07.448 --> 15:12.286
We may be on another freaky dino island,
freezing our butts off in an arctic biome,

15:12.369 --> 15:14.038
but we're still Camp Cretaceous.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.041

this isn't his preferred mode of travel,
