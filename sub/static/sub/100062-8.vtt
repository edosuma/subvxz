WEBVTT

00:02.770 --> 00:04.805
I'm just -- I'm so excited
to tell you guys --

00:04.838 --> 00:06.006
Louis, when's it your turn
to speak?

00:06.040 --> 00:07.908
I'm on a tight schedule,
and I can't waste time

00:07.941 --> 00:11.145
listening to these HOA ladies
squawk about "community spirit."

00:11.179 --> 00:12.180
Soon.

00:12.213 --> 00:14.248
And while summering
in Tuscany --

00:14.282 --> 00:16.384
You were there
for four days. In May.

00:16.417 --> 00:19.320
I noticed the locals

00:19.353 --> 00:22.656
sitting in the piazza
all day long,

00:22.690 --> 00:26.527
which inspired the theme
for our new median.

00:26.560 --> 00:30.831
Say buon giorno...
to Piazza del Eastview.

00:32.566 --> 00:34.335
And it's more than just
a traffic diversion.

00:34.368 --> 00:37.405
It is neutral territory
for community bonding.

00:37.438 --> 00:39.407
"Community."

00:39.440 --> 00:40.874
I mean, we're gonna have
a ribbon-cutting ceremony

00:40.908 --> 00:42.176
next week and --
Okay, we get it, lady.

00:42.210 --> 00:43.444
Let's move on.

00:46.447 --> 00:48.516
Okay,
next item on the agenda,

00:48.549 --> 00:51.051
I believe we have
a Louis Huang?

00:53.454 --> 00:55.756
Thanks, son.

00:55.789 --> 00:57.125
Uh, hey everyone.

00:57.158 --> 00:59.293
Many of you know me
as the peppy owner

00:59.327 --> 01:01.061
of, uh, Cattleman's Ranch,

01:01.095 --> 01:04.265
the award-winning steakhouse
located right off I-4,

01:04.298 --> 01:05.799
uh, now offering a chopped Cobb.

01:10.471 --> 01:13.274
Um, but today, I'd like
to reintroduce myself

01:13.307 --> 01:15.743
as Louis Huang,
business consultant

01:15.776 --> 01:18.312
and founder
of Lou For You Consulting.

01:18.346 --> 01:19.447
Ugh.
Enh.

01:19.480 --> 01:22.116
Uh, still finding the name.

01:23.851 --> 01:25.453
Uh, after weeks
of soul searching,

01:25.486 --> 01:26.787
I found my purpose --

01:26.820 --> 01:29.790
helping others realize
their small-business dreams.

01:29.823 --> 01:32.626
And I'm relying on referrals
from people like you --

01:32.660 --> 01:33.794
Well, what kind of
profit margins

01:33.827 --> 01:34.962
are we talking about
here?

01:34.995 --> 01:37.431
Um, I'm just starting,

01:37.465 --> 01:39.667
so it must be somewhere
around zero.

01:39.700 --> 01:40.801
-Oof.

01:40.834 --> 01:42.270
What have you done
to promote your business?

01:42.303 --> 01:44.405
Uh, well, there's this.

01:44.438 --> 01:46.274
Uh, and an e-commerce conference
coming up.

01:46.307 --> 01:48.276
Oh! My mother's
Mahjong tournament.

01:48.309 --> 01:50.278
Different ballrooms,
same Radisson.

01:50.311 --> 01:53.747
I am so excited for this
new chapter of your life, Louis.

01:53.781 --> 01:55.783
What are your Q3
profit projections?

01:55.816 --> 01:57.451
You tied up in assets,
or are you free to move?

01:57.485 --> 01:59.953
How robust
is your client portfolio?

01:59.987 --> 02:00.954
Uh...

02:00.988 --> 02:02.523
Um, w-- Uh...

02:02.556 --> 02:04.825
S-- I-I-I-I don't know yet,
but, um --

02:04.858 --> 02:05.959
Well, if you don't have
any clients,

02:05.993 --> 02:07.928
you're not
a real business, Louis.

02:09.563 --> 02:11.599
Get out of here.

02:11.632 --> 02:13.967
-- Captions by VITA --

02:14.001 --> 02:15.135
* Fresh off the boat

02:15.169 --> 02:16.837
* I'm gettin' mine
everywhere I go *

02:16.870 --> 02:19.139
* If you don't know, homey,
now you know *

02:19.173 --> 02:20.441
* Fresh off the boat

02:20.474 --> 02:22.776
* Homey, you don't know
where I come from *

02:22.810 --> 02:24.212
* But I know where I'm goin'

02:24.245 --> 02:27.014
* I'm fresh off the boat

02:28.516 --> 02:31.018
Honey, I know it's hard
to get out with two little ones,

02:31.051 --> 02:32.853
so I brought you something
to nibble on --

02:32.886 --> 02:34.688
slab of ribs
and our famous chopped Cobb.

02:34.722 --> 02:36.457
Thanks, Louis.

02:36.490 --> 02:38.125
I'm always happy to help.
It's kinda my thing.

02:38.158 --> 02:40.528
Or it was before Deidre
crushed my dreams.

02:40.561 --> 02:42.563
Well, that's kinda
Deidre's thing.

02:42.596 --> 02:44.298
That and a Mariah-level
cackle.

02:44.332 --> 02:46.567
Well,
she very publicly noted

02:46.600 --> 02:49.337
that my new consulting business
has no clients and no money.

02:49.370 --> 02:50.638
Technically,
we're in the red

02:50.671 --> 02:52.105
since printing
these business cards.

02:53.541 --> 02:56.143
This a business card

02:56.176 --> 02:58.145
or an invitation
to a really weird party?

02:58.178 --> 03:00.481
Yeah, I haven't landed
on a company name.

03:00.514 --> 03:02.483
According to Deidre, I haven't
even landed on a company.

03:02.516 --> 03:03.717
Tune her out.

03:03.751 --> 03:06.320
She is just a bottle blonde
with low bone density.

03:06.354 --> 03:07.588
That's easier said
than done.

03:07.621 --> 03:08.656
Not really.

03:08.689 --> 03:10.023
I use the same technique
for my girls.

03:10.057 --> 03:12.726
When I need a break
and they refuse to nap,

03:12.760 --> 03:16.096
I just shut off the baby monitor
for a few minutes.

03:16.129 --> 03:17.998
Oh, God. Sorry.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.600
TMI.

03:19.633 --> 03:21.335
No, Jessica and I did
the same thing with the boys.

03:21.369 --> 03:22.770
Only we didn't have
a baby monitor.

03:30.143 --> 03:32.112
That's how we got hooked
on "Mork & Mindy."

03:32.145 --> 03:34.214
More like "Mindy & Mork,"
if you ask me.

03:34.248 --> 03:35.783
Oh, it is so good to hear

03:35.816 --> 03:37.217
I'm not the only parent
who struggles.

03:37.251 --> 03:38.752
I swear,
when it's not magical,

03:38.786 --> 03:40.621
it's a waking nightmare.

03:40.654 --> 03:42.022
Oh,
there's no middle ground.

03:42.055 --> 03:44.124
It's either nirvana or a
sledgehammer to the crotch.

03:44.157 --> 03:45.726
Yes.

03:45.759 --> 03:47.961
I wish more parents would share
this kind of thing.

03:47.995 --> 03:51.432
Hey, you should start a web log
on Live Diary.

03:51.465 --> 03:53.767
I don't understand
any of those words.

03:53.801 --> 03:56.270
It's a new Internet platform I
heard about at that conference.

03:56.304 --> 03:58.906
People write posts to share
their thoughts anonymously.

03:58.939 --> 04:00.274
Hmm. What I'm hearing is

04:00.308 --> 04:01.775
I can do it
while wearing pajamas?

04:01.809 --> 04:03.043
That sounds great.

04:03.076 --> 04:05.112
Ooh, I could call it "TMI:

04:05.145 --> 04:06.614
True Mommy Insights."

04:06.647 --> 04:07.815
That's perfect.
I can help.

04:08.982 --> 04:10.250
And now that we're
throwing around names,

04:10.284 --> 04:13.721
what do you think about
Louniversal Consulting?

04:13.754 --> 04:15.756
I'll leave that to Lou.

04:16.824 --> 04:18.359
I don't get it.

04:21.662 --> 04:23.564
I like hard tacos,

04:23.597 --> 04:26.967
but I can fit more soft tacos
in my purse.

04:27.000 --> 04:27.968
Eddie:

04:28.001 --> 04:30.003
What are you guys
laughing at?

04:30.037 --> 04:32.005
Is Marvin at it
with that stray cat again?

04:32.039 --> 04:34.808
Don't plant berries if you don't
want mischievous kitties.

04:34.842 --> 04:36.109
It's opening day
for Thanksgiving Turkeys

04:36.143 --> 04:37.110
at the grocery store.

04:37.144 --> 04:38.846
It's already
Turkey Tango Time?

04:38.879 --> 04:41.281
The holiday season begins
when folks come together

04:41.315 --> 04:43.451
and fight to the death
over big, frozen birds.

04:43.484 --> 04:45.185
It was one
of the best years yet.

04:45.218 --> 04:46.954
Tie-Dye Tim
brought a lasso.

04:46.987 --> 04:48.656
A lasso!

04:50.391 --> 04:51.992
I can't believe this.
Grandma: Me, neither.

04:52.025 --> 04:55.796
Tie-Dye Tim told me
he wasn't into rope stuff.

04:55.829 --> 04:58.298
The boys and I have never missed
a Turkey Tango.

04:58.332 --> 05:00.668
30 people, 15 turkeys.

05:00.701 --> 05:01.835
Something's gotta give.

05:01.869 --> 05:03.704
Ohh, Carol-Joan and Deidre

05:03.737 --> 05:05.839
both have their claws
in a 20-pounder.

05:05.873 --> 05:08.542
C-J, use the other hand to slap.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.479
Ooh.
Ooh.

05:13.547 --> 05:16.684
It is one of my favorite
shopping fights of the year.

05:16.717 --> 05:18.686
It's like Thunderdome
without the dome.

05:18.719 --> 05:20.220
And with an aisle.

05:20.253 --> 05:21.889
Thunderaisle.

05:21.922 --> 05:23.691
Why wouldn't they invite me?

05:23.724 --> 05:24.958
They are at that age

05:24.992 --> 05:28.462
where you are not interesting
to them anymore.

05:28.496 --> 05:30.398
I am also at that age.

05:30.431 --> 05:32.633
No, that's not it.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.167
I've just been
so busy lately

05:34.201 --> 05:36.570
with studying
and job applications.

05:36.604 --> 05:39.673
They need a reminder that I can
be the life of the party.

05:39.707 --> 05:43.877
I don't think you know
what a party is.

05:46.947 --> 05:48.315
Ah.

05:48.348 --> 05:51.184
"At the end of the day,
children are like silverware.

05:51.218 --> 05:52.986
You don't have to clean them
that well --

05:53.020 --> 05:54.054
just get the food off."

05:54.087 --> 05:55.889
Amazing first post.

05:55.923 --> 05:57.357
And sticking your head
in the freezer

05:57.391 --> 05:59.226
to muffle your screams
is a great tip.

05:59.259 --> 06:00.694
Because sound doesn't travel
through cold air.

06:00.728 --> 06:02.430
Publish it.

06:05.866 --> 06:07.167
And we can track how many people
are reading

06:07.200 --> 06:09.437
with the view counter.

06:09.470 --> 06:10.538
One view.

06:10.571 --> 06:11.572
Our first view!

06:11.605 --> 06:12.573
Refresh the page.

06:12.606 --> 06:14.608
Uh...
Two views. Click again.

06:14.642 --> 06:16.777
Three! You're famous!
Oh!

06:16.810 --> 06:18.546
Wait a second.
Wait, I think we're ticking up

06:18.579 --> 06:19.613
the view counter.

06:19.647 --> 06:22.115
Four, five, six.
Oh. Oh.

06:22.149 --> 06:23.617
Maybe we should just log off
for a while.

06:23.651 --> 06:25.919
In the meantime, can I run
some new company names by you?

06:25.953 --> 06:27.421
Or maybe we c--

06:27.455 --> 06:29.457
Here we go.

06:31.158 --> 06:32.626
Okay. Oh.

06:32.660 --> 06:34.294
Sure, it's long,
but there's something about

06:34.327 --> 06:38.265
C.S. Louis and the Chronicles
of Consulting that feels right.

06:38.298 --> 06:40.901
I think we've waited
long enough.

06:41.969 --> 06:43.804
Oh, my God, Louis.

06:43.837 --> 06:44.938
100 views?!

06:44.972 --> 06:48.108
Triple didgies!
Honey, you maternal genius!

06:48.141 --> 06:49.443
This is great!

06:49.477 --> 06:50.944
Oh, I'm so glad
you encouraged me to do this.

06:50.978 --> 06:51.979
Me too.

06:52.012 --> 06:53.213
See, this is why I started

06:53.246 --> 06:55.282
Stand and DeLOUver
Consulting.

06:55.315 --> 06:56.717
Who knew so many people
out there

06:56.750 --> 06:58.418
would care
about my parenting problems?

06:58.452 --> 06:59.720
Yeah.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.622
It's an untapped market.

07:01.655 --> 07:03.624
There were ones you chose
not to say?

07:03.657 --> 07:05.826
I mean, at least
Lou Cheese Dressing is a pun.

07:06.860 --> 07:08.095
So, that one?

07:09.129 --> 07:11.264
You fools lace them up?

07:11.298 --> 07:12.733
That's what
they want you to do.

07:12.766 --> 07:13.767
Jessica: Okay!

07:13.801 --> 07:16.504
Who's ready for some fun?

07:16.537 --> 07:17.605
What's happening?

07:17.638 --> 07:19.439
Oh, no. The gas leak's
back again.

07:19.473 --> 07:21.274
I know I've been busy
lately,

07:21.308 --> 07:25.646
so I thought I'd set aside one
hour of concentrated fun time

07:25.679 --> 07:27.781
for us
to spend together.

07:27.815 --> 07:29.349
Say hello...

07:29.382 --> 07:31.018
to the Family Fun
Activity Wheel!

07:31.051 --> 07:33.253
Hello, Wheel!

07:33.286 --> 07:34.354
See? Fun.

07:34.387 --> 07:35.523
Is that just a chore wheel

07:35.556 --> 07:36.790
but with "dusting"
crossed out

07:36.824 --> 07:39.527
and "roast Grandma"
written in?

07:39.560 --> 07:41.695
Oh, we were gonna go
to the ribbon cutting ceremony

07:41.729 --> 07:42.963
for the piazza.

07:42.996 --> 07:45.699
Apparently, "piazza"
is not "pizza" in Italian,

07:45.733 --> 07:48.201
so I still have to learn
how to say "pizza" in Italian.

07:48.235 --> 07:50.804
Carol-Joan's diving
into the Italian theme.

07:50.838 --> 07:52.506
Marvin's gonna
teach everyone bocce.

07:52.540 --> 07:54.207
Play on the dirt hill
later.

07:54.241 --> 07:55.776
But the ribbon
will be cut.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.978
Let's have
some quality time together.

07:58.011 --> 08:00.013
Have some fun.
Spin the wheel.

08:00.047 --> 08:01.615
Sorry, Ma.
Maybe next time.

08:01.649 --> 08:04.451
I hear there's
a moozarelle tasting.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.286
Mozzarelle!

08:09.322 --> 08:10.624
"Spin again"?

08:10.658 --> 08:12.425
Why is that on there?

08:14.762 --> 08:16.229
So, uh, tech support,

08:16.263 --> 08:18.198
how do I know which pop-ups
are viruses

08:18.231 --> 08:19.867
and which ones really are $100?

08:20.901 --> 08:22.302
Louis!
I have good news!

08:22.335 --> 08:23.804
What's all this?!

08:23.837 --> 08:26.073
"TMI" just hit
1,000 views.

08:26.106 --> 08:27.541
Quaddie didgies?!

08:27.575 --> 08:29.577
We're in the big leagues, baby!

08:29.610 --> 08:30.744
Honey, that's incredible!

08:30.778 --> 08:33.814
Perfect time for me to tell you
about my news.

08:33.847 --> 08:36.316
I incorporated "TMI"
as a business.

08:36.349 --> 08:38.085
You did?

08:38.118 --> 08:40.387
And I'm taking you on
as my very first client.

08:40.420 --> 08:42.756
Oh, I don't think
you have to --

08:42.790 --> 08:44.257
Uh, bup, bup, bup, bup.
I know what you're thinking,

08:44.291 --> 08:46.193
and I refuse to charge you
a single cent.

08:46.226 --> 08:48.662
We're both real businesses now!

08:48.696 --> 08:49.930
We are?

08:49.963 --> 08:50.931
Unh-unh.

08:50.964 --> 08:52.600
We're on the clock.

08:52.633 --> 08:54.868
Okay, so, first order
of business...

08:54.902 --> 08:57.771
Uh, marketing.

08:57.805 --> 08:59.239
Wait.
Maybe we should order dinner.

08:59.272 --> 09:00.774
It's 3:00
in the afternoon.

09:00.808 --> 09:02.910
You didn't hire me to think
in the present.

09:02.943 --> 09:05.045
You hired me
to think ahead.

09:09.149 --> 09:11.118
You turned my blog
into a business?

09:11.151 --> 09:12.720
But I'm just doing "TMI"
for fun.

09:12.753 --> 09:14.622
Well, what's more fun
than a tax-sheltered,

09:14.655 --> 09:16.123
limited liability S-corp?

09:16.156 --> 09:18.391
As a business,
we can reach more parents.

09:20.160 --> 09:21.962
Wow, you did a lot
of unsolicited work.

09:21.995 --> 09:23.430
The hard part was sneaking
into Evan's room

09:23.463 --> 09:24.598
and stealing
his graph paper.

09:24.632 --> 09:25.599
He's a light sleeper.

09:25.633 --> 09:26.867
Anyway,

09:26.900 --> 09:30.604
I booked your very first
major promotional opportunity.

09:30.638 --> 09:31.605
"Good Morning Orlando."

09:31.639 --> 09:32.606
What?

09:32.640 --> 09:35.709
But I'm not TV-ready.

09:35.743 --> 09:37.410
I forgot what real pants
even feel like,

09:37.444 --> 09:39.713
and I lost a Ricola in my hair
a week ago.

09:39.747 --> 09:40.881
I saw it fall out
yesterday.

09:40.914 --> 09:43.283
Okay, but, I mean,
online, I'm anonymous.

09:43.316 --> 09:45.218
Exposing myself in real life
is scary.

09:45.252 --> 09:46.954
More risk, more reward.

09:46.987 --> 09:48.889
Starting my own business
was terrifying, too,

09:48.922 --> 09:50.791
but I'm finally feeling good
about it,

09:50.824 --> 09:53.126
especially now that I have
my very first client.

09:54.494 --> 09:55.963
Okay,
there's no harm in trying.

09:56.997 --> 09:58.498
Uh, there is
with crystal meth.

09:59.833 --> 10:02.970
Boys! A grocery store in Sanford
just got their turkeys,

10:03.003 --> 10:04.337
so I thought
we'd all go down and --

10:05.806 --> 10:08.275
Why are you all dressed
like European hobos?

10:08.308 --> 10:09.977
We're headed out
to the piazza.

10:10.010 --> 10:11.511
We all caught
the bocce bug.

10:11.544 --> 10:12.780
And I caught the toga bug.

10:12.813 --> 10:14.147
I'm one safety pin away
from nudity,

10:14.181 --> 10:15.282
and I love the thrill.

10:15.315 --> 10:17.785
That fake park thing
is still going on?

10:17.818 --> 10:21.121
How is that more fun than
spending time with your mother?

10:29.897 --> 10:32.299
Carol-Joan's
scooping gelato!

10:32.332 --> 10:33.633
Prego, boys!

10:34.868 --> 10:37.170
No, wait.
You can't go.

10:37.204 --> 10:39.339
-Why?
-Because...

10:39.372 --> 10:40.340
it's racist.

10:40.373 --> 10:41.975
Against Italians?

10:42.009 --> 10:43.010
I guess it's a little
on the nose.

10:43.043 --> 10:45.645
No, against us.

10:45.679 --> 10:47.948
An Asian family moves
onto the block,

10:47.981 --> 10:52.052
and suddenly, we need a median
to solve our "driving issues"?

10:52.085 --> 10:53.153
Wake up.

10:53.186 --> 10:54.621
Suddenly?

10:54.654 --> 10:55.956
We moved here
six years ago.

10:55.989 --> 10:58.591
And to be fair, we've had
our share of driving incidents.

11:07.000 --> 11:07.901
Hey.

11:07.935 --> 11:09.870
Feels like a reach.

11:09.903 --> 11:11.839
You dilute the movement
with stuff like that, Ma.

11:13.106 --> 11:14.074
Oh, my God.

11:14.107 --> 11:15.208
Meatball's playing
"Ave Maria."

11:15.242 --> 11:16.643
That's my jam.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.045
Ciao bella, mamma mia.

11:18.078 --> 11:20.180
Now that's racist.

11:22.249 --> 11:24.417
If you want to spend time
with them,

11:24.451 --> 11:25.753
then just go out there.

11:25.786 --> 11:28.055
But I want quality time
with the boys,

11:28.088 --> 11:30.523
not watch Carol-Joan
eat gelato and say,

11:30.557 --> 11:32.926
"It's not as good
as it was on holiday."

11:32.960 --> 11:34.261
She was hammered
the whole time.

11:34.294 --> 11:35.562
Of course it was good.

11:35.595 --> 11:37.264
You're trying too hard.

11:37.297 --> 11:39.532
No wonder
they prefer the median.

11:39.566 --> 11:42.269
It smells like grass,
not desperation.

11:42.302 --> 11:44.671
You're right.

11:44.704 --> 11:47.540
I must destroy
the median.

11:47.574 --> 11:50.744
You always take
the wrong lesson.

11:53.646 --> 11:55.382
Good morning, Orlando.

11:55.415 --> 11:57.250
Gus and Mey-Mey
back at ya.

11:57.284 --> 11:59.452
Two seconds in,
you're off-script.

11:59.486 --> 12:01.621
This morning,
we have Honey Ellis,

12:01.654 --> 12:05.959
the voice of popular
parenting Internet blog, "TMI!"

12:05.993 --> 12:08.361
As a mother myself,
I love it.

12:08.395 --> 12:09.462
Really?!
Oof.

12:09.496 --> 12:10.931
Oh, that's wonderful
to hear.

12:10.964 --> 12:12.966
I thought I was the only one
who ignored my kids.

12:14.334 --> 12:16.636
Sometimes, I go days
pretending I can't hear him.

12:16.669 --> 12:17.771
Days?

12:17.805 --> 12:18.939
You have a kid?

12:18.972 --> 12:22.075
So, Honey, now,
what would you say

12:22.109 --> 12:25.278
is the secret
behind "TMI's" success?

12:25.312 --> 12:27.447
Well, I wouldn't be here
if it weren't for my friend

12:27.480 --> 12:29.282
and business consultant,
Louis Huang.

12:29.316 --> 12:30.483
He's backstage right now.

12:30.517 --> 12:32.252
Oh, he's right
over there.

12:32.285 --> 12:35.455
Oh.
Oh, he's coming over.

12:35.488 --> 12:36.623
Oh, he mic'd himself.

12:36.656 --> 12:38.826
Uh, hi. Thank you
for having me on.

12:38.859 --> 12:40.393
You know, I've been
a business consultant for Honey,

12:40.427 --> 12:41.461
who has
an original voice.

12:41.494 --> 12:42.462
Gus: Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah,

12:42.495 --> 12:43.763
that's -- that's --
that's great.

12:43.797 --> 12:45.165
Now, uh, uh, uh, Mey-Mey.

12:45.198 --> 12:47.267
Uh, how old is this kid
that I've never heard of?

12:48.301 --> 12:49.336
Uh, 12.

12:49.369 --> 12:50.637
12.

12:50.670 --> 12:51.905
Now, Honey,
back to your blog.

12:51.939 --> 12:53.573
No, back to the kid.

12:53.606 --> 12:57.077
You and I took a cruise
12 years and 9 months ago,

12:57.110 --> 12:58.145
and then
when we got back,

12:58.178 --> 13:00.013
you swore off sushi
and took a sabbatical.

13:00.047 --> 13:01.314
We're talking
about a blog.

13:01.348 --> 13:02.749
No, we're talking
about my son!

13:02.782 --> 13:04.184
We need to go to break.

13:04.217 --> 13:05.819
Yes, we do need to go
to break,

13:05.853 --> 13:08.021
but let's go to break
because I'd like to know...

13:08.055 --> 13:09.256
what is his name?

13:09.289 --> 13:10.991
I-I-I-Is he --

13:11.024 --> 13:12.659
Hold this,
and flash 'em the goods.

13:12.692 --> 13:14.494
Your teeth.

13:14.527 --> 13:15.863
There.

13:17.998 --> 13:22.302
According to maritime law,
that baby belongs to no one.

13:22.335 --> 13:23.971
Hey, can you pipe down?

13:24.004 --> 13:26.173
I'm working on an op-ed
for the newspaper.

13:26.206 --> 13:27.374
How's this for a finish?

13:27.407 --> 13:30.978
"In summary,
leave bocce to the Mafia.

13:31.011 --> 13:32.645
Take down that median."

13:32.679 --> 13:35.715
You are a fool
to invoke the mob.

13:35.748 --> 13:38.318
Woman: Oh, no.

13:38.351 --> 13:39.619
Man: My parakeet said...

13:39.652 --> 13:40.854
Can't you watch that
in your room?

13:40.888 --> 13:43.456
I was here first.
I'm not moving.

13:43.490 --> 13:45.725
Looks like
you're stuck with me.

13:45.758 --> 13:47.627
Get there first!

13:47.660 --> 13:50.197
Jenny, you're one for 1,000
on good ideas.

13:50.230 --> 13:53.833
What about the time I attached
the vacuum to my wheelchair?

13:53.867 --> 13:55.969
Two for 1,000.

14:01.274 --> 14:02.809
All done
with today's blog post.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.244
"The 55-Second Rule:

14:04.277 --> 14:06.313
Why Floor Food is Better
for Everyone."

14:06.346 --> 14:07.714
Unless it's pudding.

14:07.747 --> 14:09.749
So hard to pick up.

14:09.782 --> 14:11.251
Wow, you're really churning
these posts out.

14:11.284 --> 14:14.521
I have been so inspired to write
since our readership tripled.

14:14.554 --> 14:16.389
I'm so glad you convinced me
to go on TV.

14:16.423 --> 14:17.891
I'm just doing my job.

14:17.925 --> 14:19.559
Speaking of, maybe we put
a pin in that post

14:19.592 --> 14:22.195
and instead do
a...baby food review.

14:22.229 --> 14:23.563
It'll be easy.
You just have to include

14:23.596 --> 14:24.764
these promotional
bullet points.

14:24.797 --> 14:28.401
A baby food review?

14:28.435 --> 14:31.338
They want me
to say "scrumdeeleeumpcious?"

14:31.371 --> 14:33.941
I would rather scrumdeelee-stick
my head in the oven.

14:33.974 --> 14:35.775
An oven full of cash.

14:35.808 --> 14:37.044
Come on.

14:37.077 --> 14:38.378
The advertising opportunities

14:38.411 --> 14:40.413
have been pouring in
since your TV segment.

14:40.447 --> 14:41.614
Don't you want
to make money?

14:41.648 --> 14:42.782
Like a real business?

14:42.815 --> 14:44.884
Thanks,
but I just want to write

14:44.918 --> 14:47.454
what I want to write.

14:47.487 --> 14:48.621
Hate to be that guy,

14:48.655 --> 14:50.890
but Americans don't know
how to make coffee.

14:50.924 --> 14:52.292
What coffee did you
go with, Eddie?

14:52.325 --> 14:53.460
It's an Eddie-chino --

14:53.493 --> 14:55.762
melted Rocky Road
with a bean at the bottom.

14:55.795 --> 14:57.230
Hmm.
Ma?

14:58.731 --> 14:59.732
What are you doing here?

14:59.766 --> 15:02.202
I'm getting my work done
outdoors.

15:02.235 --> 15:04.371
You know
how I love the sun.

15:04.404 --> 15:05.638
Can you do that
somewhere else?

15:05.672 --> 15:06.940
We're about to play bocce.

15:06.974 --> 15:09.709
No. I was here first,
and I'm not moving.

15:13.346 --> 15:16.083
Got the bean.

15:28.361 --> 15:30.297
"Dear TMI Honey.

15:30.330 --> 15:31.664
Thanks for the review.

15:31.698 --> 15:35.802
We think you're
scrumdeeleeumpcious, too."

15:36.869 --> 15:38.471
So, a box popped up

15:38.505 --> 15:40.107
offering me
a free trip to Cozumel.

15:40.140 --> 15:42.842
I clicked on it, and then
four more boxes popped up,

15:42.875 --> 15:44.277
so I clicked on those.

15:44.311 --> 15:46.279
Now I have no tickets,
and my computer's frozen.

15:46.313 --> 15:49.282
You published that
baby food review behind my back!

15:49.316 --> 15:50.783
What about my post?

15:50.817 --> 15:52.452
You're welcome, Honey.

15:52.485 --> 15:54.287
For what?

15:54.321 --> 15:56.189
For making your business
a success.

15:56.223 --> 15:57.324
That's why you hired me,
right?

15:57.357 --> 15:59.026
I never hired you.

15:59.059 --> 16:00.593
You hired you.

16:00.627 --> 16:02.329
But now I'm firing you.

16:02.362 --> 16:04.797
Woman: Ohh, so sorry.

16:04.831 --> 16:07.034
Did you mean to put me
on speakerphone?

16:07.067 --> 16:07.900
I wasn't sure.

16:11.804 --> 16:14.507
You're firing me as
your business consultant?

16:14.541 --> 16:15.942
Why?
Because you knew
I didn't want to post

16:15.975 --> 16:18.211
that baby food review,
and you did it anyway.

16:18.245 --> 16:20.280
Well, I saw you were nervous
about increasing

16:20.313 --> 16:21.514
"TMI's" market share,

16:21.548 --> 16:23.116
so I pulled the trigger
on that post --

16:23.150 --> 16:25.118
just like you were nervous
about being on TV,

16:25.152 --> 16:26.453
and that turned out great.

16:26.486 --> 16:29.189
And Gus and Mey-Mey are
co-parenting Little Monty.

16:29.222 --> 16:31.558
But I didn't want
any of this.

16:31.591 --> 16:32.859
Well,
don't you want this?

16:32.892 --> 16:34.361
Now you can take
your mind off

16:34.394 --> 16:36.629
the diaper budget
and focus on "TMI."

16:36.663 --> 16:39.566
Louis, this is my blog,
not yours.

16:39.599 --> 16:41.501
Well, I was only doing this
to help you.

16:41.534 --> 16:43.803
Well, I'm only doing this
to help you.

16:43.836 --> 16:46.573
You were so desperate
for a client,

16:46.606 --> 16:47.974
I just went along with it.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.576
Clearly that was a mistake.

16:53.580 --> 16:54.981
Come on, Ma,
a-scootchie over.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.983
Jessica, stop hogging
the piazza.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.186
Yeah,
we have bocce finals.

16:59.219 --> 17:00.253
Finals!

17:01.521 --> 17:04.591
Well, I guess the, uh,
bocce ball tournament

17:04.624 --> 17:07.060
has been postponed, folks,
so all bets are off.

17:07.094 --> 17:08.928
You can see Meatball here
for a refund.

17:08.961 --> 17:10.097
Sorry.

17:11.431 --> 17:12.765
Excuse me.
I have to go. I have to go.

17:12.799 --> 17:14.601
Now that we have the place
to ourselves,

17:14.634 --> 17:16.336
maybe we can have
Family Fun Time out here!

17:16.369 --> 17:18.004
We were already
having fun.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.107
Until you showed up
and ruined it.

17:21.274 --> 17:23.276
Not-a cool-a.

17:26.313 --> 17:27.547
Hey, Jessica.

17:27.580 --> 17:28.848
Brought you
some baby food.

17:28.881 --> 17:30.617
Thought you might be hungry
but not want to chew.

17:35.388 --> 17:38.258
This baby food
really is scrumdeeleeumpcious.

17:39.659 --> 17:40.793
I don't get Honey.

17:40.827 --> 17:42.795
I help her turn "TMI"
into a real business,

17:42.829 --> 17:44.264
and then she fires me.

17:44.297 --> 17:45.265
That's just Honey.

17:45.298 --> 17:46.766
Some people are born
for business,

17:46.799 --> 17:47.934
and other people were born

17:47.967 --> 17:49.569
with skin
that smells like fruit.

17:49.602 --> 17:50.703
It doesn't add up.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.239
She was actually starting
to make money.

17:52.272 --> 17:53.773
I know what this is.

17:53.806 --> 17:56.809
The problem with Honey
is she has TMI --

17:56.843 --> 17:58.278
Too Much Integrity.

17:58.311 --> 17:59.912
She's never in it
for the money.

17:59.946 --> 18:03.816
Our boys also have
a TMI problem --

18:03.850 --> 18:05.952
Too Many Interests,

18:05.985 --> 18:08.155
and none of them are me.
Oh, what do you mean?

18:08.188 --> 18:11.124
All they want to do is play
bocce on this dumb piazza

18:11.158 --> 18:12.325
instead of spending time
with me.

18:12.359 --> 18:15.094
But I've been so busy lately,
I never get to see them.

18:15.128 --> 18:16.829
If you want to spend time
with them,

18:16.863 --> 18:18.131
do what interests them,

18:18.165 --> 18:19.232
even if it happens
to be something

18:19.266 --> 18:22.669
you've taken
an arbitrary stance against.

18:24.771 --> 18:28.708
No one wants to eat
a mashed-up Thanksgiving meal.

18:30.643 --> 18:31.778
I do.

18:35.682 --> 18:37.450
You know, when you think
about it,

18:37.484 --> 18:39.319
bocce is just
adult marbles.

18:40.820 --> 18:44.857
I made you a lasagna to make up
for ruining dumb bowling.

18:44.891 --> 18:46.793
I'm not eating carbs
this week.

18:48.027 --> 18:49.162
It's still frozen.

18:49.196 --> 18:51.097
Apparently it takes an hour
to bake,

18:51.130 --> 18:53.533
and I didn't need that much time
to reflect.

18:53.566 --> 18:56.169
Between studying
and the job hunt,

18:56.203 --> 18:57.437
I've missed you guys.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.506
Us too.

18:59.539 --> 19:01.040
It's just weird
when you were jogging around,

19:01.073 --> 19:02.442
making us spin a wheel.

19:02.475 --> 19:03.610
It's forced.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.545
Like when MTV tried
to make voting cool.

19:05.578 --> 19:06.779
I know.

19:06.813 --> 19:08.281
I just wanted you
all to myself.

19:08.315 --> 19:10.383
But as long as we're together,
I am happy.

19:10.417 --> 19:13.052
Even if Carol-Joan's
hitting the old grapes.

19:13.085 --> 19:14.954
You know, Mommy,
you'd love bocce.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.456
It means "boss" in Latin.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.024
Eddie: Yeah,
it's perfect for you --

19:18.057 --> 19:20.059
precision, competition,
violence.

19:20.092 --> 19:21.628
You wanna come play
with us?

19:21.661 --> 19:23.463
I do love violence.

19:30.169 --> 19:32.205
Hmm.

19:32.239 --> 19:34.541
Hey, Honey.
I was, uh, wondering

19:34.574 --> 19:35.742
if I could use
your computer.

19:35.775 --> 19:37.544
And give it a virus?

19:37.577 --> 19:38.878
No, thanks.

19:38.911 --> 19:40.980
I think I've had
enough consulting.

19:41.013 --> 19:44.484
I want to show you
the latest "TMI" post.

19:47.954 --> 19:49.856
You took down the review
and posted

19:49.889 --> 19:51.924
my "55-Second Rule" piece
instead?

19:51.958 --> 19:53.092
I was wrong
to sell out your blog.

19:53.125 --> 19:54.093
That's not you.

19:55.295 --> 19:57.397
I know you just wanted
to help.

19:57.430 --> 19:59.599
I got so caught up trying
to prove I could be successful,

19:59.632 --> 20:02.602
I forgot the job is supporting
someone else and their dreams.

20:02.635 --> 20:03.836
Thanks, Louis.

20:03.870 --> 20:05.738
You are great
at what you do.

20:05.772 --> 20:06.939
I know
you are gonna make

20:06.973 --> 20:08.741
a small-business owner so happy
one day.

20:08.775 --> 20:10.377
Well,
you've gotta keep blogging.

20:10.410 --> 20:12.445
It's so good, and you've got
such a relatable voice.

20:12.479 --> 20:14.347
Oh, yeah,
I'm not stopping.

20:14.381 --> 20:16.115
I've got so many ideas.

20:16.148 --> 20:19.218
The other day, I wore a diaper,
and it was magical.

20:19.252 --> 20:22.255
Yeah. Yeah, yeah!

20:22.289 --> 20:24.291
Ooh. Guess what?

20:24.324 --> 20:26.293
I finally thought
of a good company name --

20:26.326 --> 20:28.194
All About Lou Consulting.

20:28.227 --> 20:31.264
Yeah. Yeah, yeah!

20:31.298 --> 20:35.234
Or what about just
Louis Huang Consulting?

20:37.270 --> 20:38.671
Wow.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.550
Are you not entertained?!

20:50.583 --> 20:51.584
Marvin: And that's game.

20:51.618 --> 20:52.819
Jessica wins!

20:52.852 --> 20:53.886
You killed it, Ma!

20:56.323 --> 20:59.158
Clear out, people!
This median was constructed

20:59.191 --> 21:00.460
without a permit.

21:00.493 --> 21:02.295
Bulldozers
are on their way.

21:02.329 --> 21:04.631
What?!
Who snitched?

21:04.664 --> 21:06.799
There was an anonymous op-ed
in the newspaper.

21:06.833 --> 21:08.468
I bet
it was Carol-Joan.

21:08.501 --> 21:10.136
No, it wasn't me.

21:10.169 --> 21:11.838
Well, it was good
while it lasted.

21:11.871 --> 21:13.172
Arrivederci, bocce.

21:13.205 --> 21:16.509
No way. Let's continue
this thing in our backyard.

21:18.144 --> 21:19.446
Sorry,
Huang family only.

21:19.479 --> 21:21.448
Boys, grab the gelato cart.
Let's go.

21:21.481 --> 21:23.850
Bring on the bulldozer.

21:23.883 --> 21:26.353
Jim, bring in the bulls.
