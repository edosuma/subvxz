♪♪

00:10.591 --> 00:13.554
Our junk drawer's a lot
bigger than most families.

00:13.554 --> 00:15.476
But you know
what they say.

00:15.476 --> 00:18.139
One man's trash is another
girl's next invention.

00:24.105 --> 00:25.986
Sweet!
This'll work perfect

00:25.986 --> 00:27.318
for that snow machine
I wanna build.

00:27.318 --> 00:29.610
You are not building
a snow machine.

00:29.610 --> 00:32.113
If you wanna remember winter, go
stand in front of the freezer.

00:32.113 --> 00:33.744
Staring at frozen taquitos?
Not as fun.

00:33.744 --> 00:36.327
Why do you think
I wanna build a snow machine?

00:36.327 --> 00:39.540
Hey! It's the gift certificate
my parents gave us

00:39.540 --> 00:41.462
to that bed
and breakfast.

00:41.462 --> 00:43.043
Oh, yeah.

00:43.043 --> 00:45.426
Right by the sea.
So romantic.

00:45.426 --> 00:48.339
They probably expected us
to re-gift it back to them.

00:48.339 --> 00:50.341
They knew
we'd never go.

00:50.341 --> 00:53.094
Well, joke's on them.
It expires Sunday.

00:53.094 --> 00:55.136
We should go.
We could get
a sitter for the kids.

00:55.136 --> 00:57.057
I think
we burned that bridge.

00:57.057 --> 00:59.270
Brought you something
pretty from the garden.

01:02.683 --> 01:04.185
TOM:
 What about the other one?

01:04.185 --> 01:06.817
MAN: Not cool,
guys, not cool.

01:06.817 --> 01:09.320
That guy was
a Navy SEAL.

01:09.320 --> 01:12.113
Just go.
We don't need a babysitter.

01:12.113 --> 01:14.405
Rachel's 16.
She can totally
take care of us.

01:14.405 --> 01:16.697
Rachel?!
In charge?

01:16.697 --> 01:18.539
( laughs )
Come on, Harls.

01:18.539 --> 01:20.331
That is clearly
a desperate attempt

01:20.331 --> 01:21.542
to get rid of us.

01:21.542 --> 01:23.204
No.

01:23.204 --> 01:26.167
Yes. I want to build
that snow machine,

01:26.167 --> 01:28.129
but Rachel
never steps up,

01:28.129 --> 01:30.511
so the rest of us
never get to live the dream--

01:30.511 --> 01:33.974
a house where the parents
go away and the kids go nuts.

01:35.346 --> 01:37.558
Rachel can
totally do it.

01:37.558 --> 01:38.519
( Daphne whooping )

01:38.519 --> 01:41.392
Hey, do not run
with these scissors.

01:41.392 --> 01:43.934
See. Told you
she's responsible.

01:43.934 --> 01:46.187
I need them to
trim my split ends.

01:46.187 --> 01:47.988
Use these.

01:50.821 --> 01:52.613
Whoo!

01:52.613 --> 01:54.575
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:56.497 --> 01:58.699
She handed them to her
point down.

01:58.699 --> 01:59.950
Very safe.

02:02.793 --> 02:04.875
Seriously?

02:04.875 --> 02:07.838
You still can't put
metal in a microwave? Ugh!

02:07.838 --> 02:10.420

so I could build
 my snow machine,

03:09.770 --> 03:12.483
it was gonna take
 a major snow job.

03:12.483 --> 03:14.485
What's goin' on?

03:14.485 --> 03:16.697
How is everyone
already up and dressed?

03:16.697 --> 03:19.450
We wanted to enjoy
this magnificent morn.

03:19.450 --> 03:22.373
Early bird gets the worm,
and I like worms.

03:22.373 --> 03:26.537
Don't mind me, just checking
my extra-credit homework.

03:26.537 --> 03:28.168
Tea, Mother?

03:30.831 --> 03:34.174
Funny. That sweet little girl
looked just like Daphne.

03:34.174 --> 03:37.097
May I offer you some
fresh-squeezed orange juice?

03:40.841 --> 03:44.935
It'll go great with
the delicious breakfast
I made for you.

03:44.935 --> 03:47.648
I don't know what
you made, but this is bologna.

03:47.648 --> 03:49.730
- What's going on?
- Rachel woke up early

03:49.730 --> 03:52.152
to make sure everyone
got a proper start on the day.

03:52.152 --> 03:53.524
BOTH: Rachel?!

03:53.524 --> 03:56.907
Morning. Isn't it
a lovely day?

03:56.907 --> 03:58.739
You made this happen?

03:58.739 --> 04:00.120
It's amazing
what you can do

04:00.120 --> 04:01.822
when you put your mind to it.

04:01.822 --> 04:03.123
I'm 16 now.

04:03.123 --> 04:04.825
I should be
helping my parents,

04:04.825 --> 04:06.627
and showing more
leadership.

04:08.539 --> 04:12.212
Sorry. Love the breakfast,
not buyin' the show.

04:12.212 --> 04:14.545
I don't blame
 Mom and Dad.

04:14.545 --> 04:16.176
You leave a kid
 home alone,

04:16.176 --> 04:18.218
there's a chance
 they'll get into trouble.

04:18.218 --> 04:19.640
With seven kids,

04:19.640 --> 04:21.512
there's seven times
 the chance.

04:23.594 --> 04:25.726
Even if Rachel
was faking,

04:25.726 --> 04:27.688
she taught Daphne
how to curtsy.

04:27.688 --> 04:29.600
She got Beast
to take a shower.

04:29.600 --> 04:32.443
Did you smell his hair?
It's actually safe
to do that now.

04:32.443 --> 04:35.986
Wow. The closest Beast
has come to washing his own hair

04:35.986 --> 04:39.109
is giving himself
a swirly in the toilet.

04:39.109 --> 04:41.782
If Rachel could pull this
off, maybe she can handle
being in charge for one night.

04:41.782 --> 04:44.365
She can.
This was all Rachel.

04:45.576 --> 04:47.668
Okay, remember the rules.
No one leaves,

04:47.668 --> 04:50.040
no one comes to visit,
no one burns down
the house.

04:50.040 --> 04:53.123
Although if the house
is on fire, you should
probably technically leave.

04:54.755 --> 04:56.917
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.

04:56.917 --> 04:59.550
All right.
Bye, everyone.
Be good.

04:59.550 --> 05:03.133
( all saying good-bye)

05:03.133 --> 05:05.596
- Enjoy yourself.
- Don't worry about us.

05:05.596 --> 05:09.690
( raucous cheering )

05:09.690 --> 05:12.393
Everyone quiet.

05:12.393 --> 05:13.604
I'm in charge now.

05:18.068 --> 05:20.401
Yeah, even saying that
was too much work.

05:20.401 --> 05:23.243
There are no rules.
Do whatever you want.

05:23.243 --> 05:25.706
Hey, you know that list
Mom and Dad made

05:25.706 --> 05:28.118
of all the things we're
not allowed to do in the house?

05:28.118 --> 05:30.411
The Diaz Don't List.

05:30.411 --> 05:32.663
Let's do every single
one of 'em.

05:32.663 --> 05:34.715
Boom!

05:34.715 --> 05:35.626
I'm gonna watch
TV nonstop.
Boom!

05:35.626 --> 05:38.799
Ditto that. Boom!

05:38.799 --> 05:41.722
I'm gonna go build
my snow machine. Boom.

05:41.722 --> 05:43.884
Why are we all
still standing around?

05:45.636 --> 05:46.847
Everybody on three.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.729
One, two, three.

05:48.729 --> 05:50.391
Freedom!

05:50.391 --> 05:52.523
All right,
we did the first one.

05:52.523 --> 05:54.645
Don't leave
the cabinet doors open.

05:56.437 --> 05:58.649
Hang on. Is
the refrigerator
a cabinet?

05:58.649 --> 06:00.441
I'm not sure.

06:04.945 --> 06:06.867
Just to be safe.

06:06.867 --> 06:10.581
Okay. Not as much fun
as I thought it would be,

06:10.581 --> 06:12.082
but it was
a good warm-up.

06:12.082 --> 06:14.044
Let's see what's next.

06:14.044 --> 06:15.916
Don't pass gas
in the kitchen.

06:15.916 --> 06:18.128
Done.

06:18.128 --> 06:21.051
Wow, we're making
good time.

06:24.595 --> 06:25.966
So what should
we watch first?

06:25.966 --> 06:27.718
I was thinking
a horror movie.

06:27.718 --> 06:29.770
I wanted to watch
the bowling finals.

06:29.770 --> 06:32.563
I know a horror movie
that takes place
in a bowling alley.

06:32.563 --> 06:34.685
Strike Of Death.
 They use heads for balls.

06:34.685 --> 06:37.067
Oh, I've seen
that poster.

06:37.067 --> 06:39.069
"No one will be spared."
I'm in.

06:39.069 --> 06:40.781
Let's do it.

06:43.694 --> 06:46.867
Sorry, Daphne.
We're older than you.

06:46.867 --> 06:48.288
We get dibs on the TV.

06:48.288 --> 06:50.080
Take it up with
Mom and Dad.

06:50.080 --> 06:52.583
Oh, wait,
they're not here.

06:52.583 --> 06:54.535
Fine. You watch
for a while,

06:54.535 --> 06:56.797
and we'll trade off.
Good idea, right?

06:56.797 --> 06:57.958
If you're the guy
without the remote.

06:57.958 --> 07:00.881
I only get an hour
of TV every day,

07:00.881 --> 07:04.384
and I wanna watch all
the channels I've been missing.

07:04.384 --> 07:06.807
( reporter speaking
indistinctly )

07:06.807 --> 07:09.850
I am very concerned
about this fiscal year.

07:17.187 --> 07:18.729
( sighs )

07:18.729 --> 07:20.020
( sighs louder )

07:20.020 --> 07:22.322
When someone
sighs like that,

07:22.322 --> 07:23.984
you're supposed to ask
what's wrong.

07:23.984 --> 07:26.156
Harley, I'm
talking to you.

07:26.156 --> 07:28.198
You are? I thought you
had an earpiece in

07:28.198 --> 07:29.780
and were talking
to your friends.

07:29.780 --> 07:31.662
I'm mad at my squad
right now.

07:31.662 --> 07:33.664
Phoebe and Zia went
to Costa Rica on a vacay,

07:33.664 --> 07:35.375
and they didn't
invite me.

07:35.375 --> 07:37.578
There's a lot of things
you don't like there.

07:37.578 --> 07:39.960
Plants, trees, insects.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.792
Insects in
plants and trees.

07:41.792 --> 07:44.675
Hello. I don't
want to go.

07:44.675 --> 07:46.757
- I want to say no.
- ( text alert chimes )

07:46.757 --> 07:48.759
They're posting
tons of cool pics.

07:48.759 --> 07:51.091
How dare they have
that much fun without me?

07:51.091 --> 07:53.854
Yeah, that's really
rude of them...

07:53.854 --> 07:55.646
enjoying a vacation
you didn't wanna go on.

07:55.646 --> 07:57.768
Totally.
What is that?

07:57.768 --> 08:00.310
I'm building a snow machine.
This is the model.

08:00.310 --> 08:02.312
With Mom and Dad gone,

08:02.312 --> 08:03.774
it'll be Christmas
in July.

08:03.774 --> 08:06.697
Hold on.

08:06.697 --> 08:09.910
Can you make it look like
I'm on a ski vacation?

08:09.910 --> 08:11.411
I guess so.

08:11.411 --> 08:13.744
I could put a ramp up
in the backyard

08:13.744 --> 08:15.666
so it looks like
you're on a ski slope.

08:15.666 --> 08:17.497
You could tell people
you're in Australia.

08:17.497 --> 08:20.671
If you could do that,
it would be so cool.

08:20.671 --> 08:23.383
I could tell my friends
I'm skiing with Chris Hemsworth.

08:23.383 --> 08:26.927
My best friends
would hate that.
I love it!

08:26.927 --> 08:30.891
Okay, that's the first time
Rachel's ever called me cool.

08:30.891 --> 08:33.472
It's also the most
sentences in a row

08:33.472 --> 08:35.936
she's ever said to me.
The old record was three.

08:35.936 --> 08:37.808
And the third one was
"Shut up."

08:37.808 --> 08:39.850
So you really
can do it?

08:39.850 --> 08:41.812
Of course,
and the beauty is,

08:41.812 --> 08:43.482
Mom and Dad
will never know.

08:47.908 --> 08:50.611
I love that they actually
thought we trust Rachel.

08:52.913 --> 08:55.826
We've raised them
to think we're dumb.
Good on us.

09:03.163 --> 09:06.126
I think this looks
pretty good.

09:06.126 --> 09:08.719
And the best part is,
"Go play in the snow"

09:08.719 --> 09:10.761
is not on the Diaz Don't List.

09:10.761 --> 09:12.512
So Lewie and Beast
have zero interest.

09:12.512 --> 09:14.014
You're a genius.

09:14.014 --> 09:15.976
Oh, please.
I'm just a girl

09:15.976 --> 09:18.518
with an invention bag,
taking it one day at a time.

09:18.518 --> 09:19.980
Okay. Photoshoot.

09:23.483 --> 09:25.816
Want one where Chris Hemsworth
is checking you out?

09:25.816 --> 09:28.108
Nah. Get in here.
Let's do one together.

09:28.108 --> 09:29.860
You wanna be
in a picture with me?

09:29.860 --> 09:31.361
Yeah. Come on.
It'll be fun.

09:31.361 --> 09:33.363
Throw on a jacket.
I brought some spares.

09:33.363 --> 09:36.536
Only a rookie does a photoshoot
without multiple looks.

09:36.536 --> 09:38.538
This is the first time
 Rachel's ever wanted

09:38.538 --> 09:40.460
to spend time with me.

09:46.046 --> 09:47.798
( gasps )
This is a good one.

09:47.798 --> 09:49.589
I'm tagging it
"snow sistas."

09:51.551 --> 09:53.263
She even tagged me.

09:53.263 --> 09:55.265
And this time,
it wasn't "nerd alert."

09:59.269 --> 10:01.271
She's sound asleep.

10:01.271 --> 10:03.273
The joke's on her
for wanting to watch
something educational.

10:03.273 --> 10:05.726
Now we can watch
our movie.

10:09.730 --> 10:11.491
Her grip's like iron.

10:11.491 --> 10:14.945
Yeah. She works out
her right claw just for
moments like this.

10:14.945 --> 10:17.287
No worries.
Got a back-up plan.

10:17.287 --> 10:20.741
The shaving cream
in the hand trick.

10:20.741 --> 10:22.793
Yes. Go with
the classics.

10:24.000 --> 10:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:33.513 --> 10:35.926
Look who's got
the remote now.

10:35.926 --> 10:39.099
Hey, Daphne, you got
a little something on your...

10:39.099 --> 10:41.061
everywhere.

10:41.061 --> 10:43.764
Laugh now, because
very, very soon,

10:43.764 --> 10:45.645
you won't be.

10:54.114 --> 10:55.696
X marks the spot.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.873
I can't wait to see what
Daphne does for revenge.

11:02.873 --> 11:05.125
I bet she puts vinegar
in their mouthwash.

11:05.125 --> 11:07.047
No. They'll be
expecting that.

11:07.047 --> 11:10.170
I'm saying pail of water
over the door.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.132
No. Too soft.
Pail of rocks.

11:12.132 --> 11:15.505
Okay. You're on.
Twenty bucks.

11:15.505 --> 11:18.008
Our kids are really
entertaining when we
don't live with them.

11:18.008 --> 11:20.891
Let's see what's on
the Lewie and Beast network.

11:24.224 --> 11:26.146
Don't sumo wrestle
in the house.

11:27.607 --> 11:29.309
( both grunting )

11:30.941 --> 11:33.193
SUZY: Wow!

11:33.193 --> 11:36.737
They're already up to
number 14 on the Diaz Don'ts.

11:36.737 --> 11:38.869
- Are those my good ties?
- Not anymore.

11:38.869 --> 11:41.371
Let's mess with
these guys.

11:45.786 --> 11:48.628
( phone ringing,
boys grunting loudly )

11:58.178 --> 12:00.430
- Hello.
- SUZY: Hey, guys.

12:00.430 --> 12:02.392
Just checking in.
What are you up to?

12:02.392 --> 12:04.724
- We're reading.
- And discussing.

12:04.724 --> 12:06.646
Good to hear.

12:06.646 --> 12:09.900
Hey, by the way, I think I left
a five-dollar bill

12:09.900 --> 12:11.651
on the floor of your room.

12:20.410 --> 12:22.032
Never mind.

12:22.032 --> 12:23.453
Here it is
 in my pocket.

12:23.453 --> 12:26.246
Listen, I forgot
 to tell you something.

12:26.246 --> 12:29.419
Don't eat the kale salad
that's in the fridge.

12:29.419 --> 12:31.922
Okay? Bye.

12:33.083 --> 12:35.335
We just got another
"don't" to do.

12:35.335 --> 12:37.047
To the kitchen.

12:40.050 --> 12:43.433
They're gonna get
more vitamins than
they've had all year.

12:49.439 --> 12:51.231
So Mt. Harley
still open for business?

12:51.231 --> 12:53.443
Yeah. Rachel and I
are just chillin' in the snow.

12:53.443 --> 12:55.235
No bigs.

12:55.235 --> 12:57.697
You're hanging out
with Rachel?
Did she lose a bet?

12:57.697 --> 13:00.200
No. It's not like
that other time.

13:00.200 --> 13:01.992
She even posted
a photo of us.

13:03.243 --> 13:05.745
Hey, how'd you get
the remote from Daphne?

13:05.745 --> 13:06.997
We pranked it
out of her.

13:06.997 --> 13:09.169
Are you out
of your mind?

13:09.169 --> 13:11.171
You never take
something from Daphne

13:11.171 --> 13:12.332
without her permission.

13:16.006 --> 13:17.087
What?

13:17.087 --> 13:18.798
It's just one fry.

13:22.222 --> 13:24.304
( plate shatters )

13:26.476 --> 13:28.228
Good luck.
You're gonna need it.

13:29.479 --> 13:32.432
( bowling pins clatter,
people screaming )

13:39.109 --> 13:40.941
That's them.

13:42.112 --> 13:46.116
Don't go to sleep.

13:48.288 --> 13:51.451
We've made a terrible,
terrible mistake.

13:54.124 --> 13:56.006
Hey, I got the...

13:58.168 --> 13:59.759
Oh. Cuff's here.

14:01.171 --> 14:03.093
I didn't know
anybody was coming over.

14:03.093 --> 14:05.225
Oh... ( laughs )

14:05.225 --> 14:07.267
I wouldn't have
a party without my bae.

14:07.267 --> 14:09.349
I thought we were
taking saucer selfies.

14:09.349 --> 14:10.931
Snow saucers?

14:10.931 --> 14:12.732
That's like a snowmobile
for your butt!

14:14.144 --> 14:16.236
New plan.
I'm posting pictures

14:16.236 --> 14:17.777
of my rockin'
snow party

14:17.777 --> 14:19.649
that those girls
weren't invited to.

14:19.649 --> 14:22.532
Phoebe and Zia
are gonna be crying
in their Costa Rican whatever.

14:22.532 --> 14:25.195
But don't they think
you're in Australia?

14:25.195 --> 14:26.536
You uploaded our selfie.

14:26.536 --> 14:27.867
Luckily, I didn't.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.659
I noticed one of
my eyes was squinty,

14:29.659 --> 14:31.161
so I deleted it.

14:41.421 --> 14:43.173
Locked and secured.

14:43.173 --> 14:44.965
Okay, I think we're good.

14:44.965 --> 14:47.387
I don't see how Daphne
could get in here.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.599
This is way scarier than
watching heads roll down
a bowling alley.

14:49.599 --> 14:50.850
Oh, yeah.

14:50.850 --> 14:52.642
( both laughing )

14:52.642 --> 14:55.936
I am so glad we blew off
our reservation.

14:55.936 --> 14:57.938
Look how scared they are.

14:57.938 --> 15:00.230
I really like tonight's
lineup on the bad
decision channel.

15:00.230 --> 15:02.072
It's time to lob in
a Dad grenade.

15:02.072 --> 15:03.823
The best part
about this show...

15:03.823 --> 15:05.195
it's interactive.

15:05.195 --> 15:07.237
( phone rings )

15:08.578 --> 15:10.450
- Hello.
 - Hey, it's Dad.

15:10.450 --> 15:13.413
- I just wanna make sure
Daphne's in bed.
 - Oh, yeah.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.415
She's all tucked in
and dreaming of...

15:15.415 --> 15:16.666
lollipops
and puppy dogs.

15:16.666 --> 15:18.588
Great.

15:18.588 --> 15:21.301
Because I just remembered
I left out some Incredi-Glue.

15:21.301 --> 15:23.383
She could really get in
 some trouble with that.

15:23.383 --> 15:24.674
( laughs )

15:24.674 --> 15:26.596
But if she's in bed,

15:26.596 --> 15:28.428
it's all good.
Bye now.

15:28.428 --> 15:30.600
Daphne is armed.

15:30.600 --> 15:31.811
She's got Incredi-Glue.

15:31.811 --> 15:34.224
Um...

15:34.224 --> 15:36.316
let's flip this mattress
up against the door.

15:36.316 --> 15:37.187
Come on.

15:38.228 --> 15:40.270
Oh, this is fun.

15:40.270 --> 15:42.482
We should get out
of the house more often.

15:47.277 --> 15:50.660
Ugh. This
is really bad.

15:50.660 --> 15:53.033
My mouth tastes gross.

15:53.033 --> 15:56.336
But I think
my eyesight is better.

15:56.336 --> 15:57.627
It's getting late.

15:57.627 --> 15:59.629
We're never gonna
get through this list.

15:59.629 --> 16:01.881
We're still on
the first page.

16:01.881 --> 16:03.673
We better jump
straight to the top.

16:03.673 --> 16:05.345
Numero uno.

16:05.345 --> 16:07.717
The biggest "don't"
there is.

16:07.717 --> 16:10.390
BOTH: Don't take
a pudding bath.

16:10.390 --> 16:13.933
This is going
to be glorious.

16:16.356 --> 16:18.768
We are so over
this party, Chris.

16:20.520 --> 16:22.772
- Hey, Harley.
- Yeah?

16:22.772 --> 16:24.864
Can you hook us up
with a little more snow?

16:24.864 --> 16:27.107
Sure.

16:33.373 --> 16:35.495
( screaming )

16:35.495 --> 16:37.577
Oops.

16:37.577 --> 16:40.500
Sudden flurry.
Sorry.

16:40.500 --> 16:43.383
Whoa. Your sister
just shot you with snow.

16:43.383 --> 16:45.675
I can see that, Cuff.

16:45.675 --> 16:49.049
Actually, I can't.

16:49.049 --> 16:51.761
Rachel might be cold,

16:51.761 --> 16:53.633
but I'm colder.

17:05.145 --> 17:07.646
I'm glad she can sleep
 so soundly.

17:07.646 --> 17:10.240
I was tossing and turning
 all night

17:10.240 --> 17:12.362
with that knife
 in my back.

17:12.362 --> 17:14.534
( squishy sounds )

17:19.749 --> 17:21.540
More cream,
my good man?

17:21.540 --> 17:23.333
Don't mind if I do.

17:40.520 --> 17:42.142
Hey, Georgie.

17:42.142 --> 17:43.643
Wake up.

17:43.643 --> 17:45.565
It looks like
we dodged Daphne
and her death posse.

17:45.565 --> 17:47.357
What a relief.

17:50.360 --> 17:52.152
Your eyebrows.

17:52.152 --> 17:53.243
They're gone.

17:53.243 --> 17:55.115
What?! Daphne.

17:55.115 --> 17:56.906
Is it noticeable?

17:56.906 --> 17:58.158
Only when you
look at you.

18:02.122 --> 18:05.255
Phew!
Still have mine.

18:08.968 --> 18:10.300
Well-played.

18:10.300 --> 18:12.302
Is it possible I could
have one of yours?

18:15.885 --> 18:18.218
( shrieking )

18:28.438 --> 18:29.819
What is the big...

18:29.819 --> 18:31.571
( shrieks )

18:34.033 --> 18:35.825
How great is this?

18:36.996 --> 18:40.790
Looks like somebody's had
a visit from the eyebrow fairy.

18:43.413 --> 18:45.415
Ironic. She's
making an angel.

18:48.298 --> 18:49.629
Tom, wake up.

18:49.629 --> 18:52.462
There's some kind of
glitch with the tablet.

18:52.462 --> 18:54.884
Look at this.
The camera in
the living room

18:54.884 --> 18:56.636
is completely white.

18:56.636 --> 18:58.258
What are we
going to do?

18:58.258 --> 19:00.059
I don't know.
I'm starting to panic.

19:00.059 --> 19:02.852
You are? It's hard to
tell without the eyebrows.

19:02.852 --> 19:04.474
How did all this snow
get in here?

19:04.474 --> 19:05.565
The snow machine!

19:05.565 --> 19:07.567
Why isn't it
melting in here?

19:07.567 --> 19:09.319
That's on us.
Number 21.

19:09.319 --> 19:11.401
Don't blast
the air conditioning.

19:11.401 --> 19:13.403
( phone ringing )

19:13.403 --> 19:16.906
( all chattering )

19:16.906 --> 19:19.659
Everybody quiet!
It's Mom and Dad!

19:19.659 --> 19:21.781
( phone rings )

19:21.781 --> 19:23.373
Hi, Mom.

19:23.373 --> 19:24.954
Hey, Harley.

19:24.954 --> 19:26.626
How's everyone there?

19:26.626 --> 19:28.588
Oh, you know.

19:28.588 --> 19:29.999
Same old
same old.

19:29.999 --> 19:32.752
Great. Well, just wanted
to let you know

19:32.752 --> 19:34.634
we're coming home early.

19:34.634 --> 19:38.177
- Perfect.
 - We're on our way.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.510
See you in a few.
They're on their way.

19:40.510 --> 19:44.063
All right, everyone,
you know what to do. Hide!

19:47.767 --> 19:49.519
You know what?

19:49.519 --> 19:52.071
We're never going
to clean this up in time.

19:52.071 --> 19:54.694
Call 'em back and warn them
what they're coming home to.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.155
This isn't my fault.

19:56.155 --> 19:58.698
You're the one who built
the snow machine. You call.

19:58.698 --> 20:01.160
No way. You're the one
who left it on all night.

20:01.160 --> 20:04.874
This is your thing.
I figured you'd take care of it.

20:04.874 --> 20:07.667
It was your idea
to have the party.

20:07.667 --> 20:09.829
It was your idea
to convince Mom and Dad

20:09.829 --> 20:12.752
to leave me in charge.
I never said I could do it.

20:12.752 --> 20:14.674
You're right.

20:14.674 --> 20:17.046
I stuck my neck out.

20:17.046 --> 20:18.968
You never stick
your neck out for anyone.

20:18.968 --> 20:23.182
I let you use my snow machine,
and what did you do?

20:23.182 --> 20:26.476
Had a party and didn't
even invite me.

20:26.476 --> 20:29.108
I didn't think you would want
to hang out with my friends.

20:29.108 --> 20:30.980
I don't care about them.

20:30.980 --> 20:33.693
I wanted to hang out with you.

20:33.693 --> 20:36.616
I mean, for the first
time in forever,

20:36.616 --> 20:39.158
we were actually
having fun.

20:39.158 --> 20:41.571
You acted like
you liked me.

20:41.571 --> 20:43.573
Of course I like you.

20:43.573 --> 20:44.954
You sure don't show it.

20:44.954 --> 20:46.956
I shouldn't have to.

20:46.956 --> 20:48.458
We're sisters.

20:48.458 --> 20:50.079
We're family.

20:50.079 --> 20:53.082
Those are the people
you don't have to be nice to.

20:53.082 --> 20:56.506
You just know they love you,
and you love them back.

21:00.470 --> 21:02.141
No one's calling
Mom and Dad,

21:02.141 --> 21:04.934
and no one is
going down for this crime,

21:04.934 --> 21:07.016
because there's still
time to fix it before
they get back.

21:07.016 --> 21:10.980
Everyone here now!

21:10.980 --> 21:13.443
Ethan and Georgie,
upstairs.

21:13.443 --> 21:14.734
Lewie and Beast,
bathroom.

21:14.734 --> 21:17.527
Harley and Daphne,
get started on the snow.

21:17.527 --> 21:19.949
( all complaining )

21:19.949 --> 21:22.031
Anyone who doesn't
get moving now

21:22.031 --> 21:23.823
is going to answer to me.

21:23.823 --> 21:26.245
Just when I need it most,

21:26.245 --> 21:28.578
Rachel's stepping up
and being responsible.

21:28.578 --> 21:31.210
When a regular person
might say sorry,

21:31.210 --> 21:33.122
Rachel says...

21:33.122 --> 21:34.504
Move, move, move!

21:41.681 --> 21:43.843
Looks a little bit
like a squirrel's tail,

21:43.843 --> 21:45.685
but I can work with that.

21:51.601 --> 21:53.733
With seven kids
 home alone,

21:53.733 --> 21:57.196
there might be seven times
 the chance for trouble.

21:57.196 --> 21:59.529
But it also means that
 the clean-up can happen

21:59.529 --> 22:01.200
seven times as fast.

22:01.200 --> 22:03.533
♪ ♪

22:07.076 --> 22:08.828
Mom and Dad
will never know.

22:08.828 --> 22:10.790
Good.

22:10.790 --> 22:13.332
Because I want them
to go away again.

22:13.332 --> 22:15.004
By the way,

22:15.004 --> 22:17.256
the picture of you and me
got 71 likes.

22:17.256 --> 22:19.168
You posted a photo of us?

22:19.168 --> 22:21.801
Yeah. I tagged it
"sister squad."

22:21.801 --> 22:23.222
We look cute.

22:23.222 --> 22:24.964
Cool.

22:27.266 --> 22:31.230
Hey, it's more of me than
she's ever posted before.

22:34.023 --> 22:36.856
Hi, everyone.
We're back!

22:36.856 --> 22:39.649
( kids clamoring )

22:39.649 --> 22:42.281
Wow, this place
looks great.

22:42.281 --> 22:44.283
It really does.

22:44.283 --> 22:46.035
Looks even better
than when we left.

22:46.035 --> 22:47.537
This was all Rachel.

22:47.537 --> 22:49.198
Harley helped
a little, too.

22:49.198 --> 22:52.201
I gotta say,
I'm really proud
of you guys.

22:52.201 --> 22:55.084
