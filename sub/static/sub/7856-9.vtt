00:01.639 --> 00:03.759
You seem more on edge than before.

00:05.200 --> 00:07.320
I received another letter.

00:07.360 --> 00:09.519
Does this letter
urge confession, too?

00:09.519 --> 00:10.679
Yes.

00:11.919 --> 00:13.960
Could these letters
be from your wife?

00:14.000 --> 00:15.960
They're not her style.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.440
But you two are estranged?

00:19.760 --> 00:21.039
For many years, now.

00:23.519 --> 00:26.519
Shall we talk about why she left?

00:29.039 --> 00:30.320
I can be...

00:32.240 --> 00:34.280
..obstinate, Doctor.

00:35.479 --> 00:36.679
Evidently.

00:38.640 --> 00:42.000
To what are these letters
urging you to confess?

00:42.039 --> 00:43.399
That's my business.

00:44.840 --> 00:46.759
We are bound by privilege here.

00:47.759 --> 00:50.079
Your secrets will stay secret.

00:53.600 --> 00:59.439
And what will happen if you don't do
what this new letter demands?

01:01.280 --> 01:04.840
It says, if I don't confess today,
then my son will be murdered...

01:07.280 --> 01:08.239
..tonight.

01:51.599 --> 01:53.400
APPLAUSE

01:53.439 --> 01:54.920
That was stunning.

01:54.920 --> 01:57.759
Anyone would be hard pushed
to take the title from you.

01:57.759 --> 02:00.400
I doubt I'll have to push that hard.

02:00.439 --> 02:03.239
Now, Mungo Hooter
will open the programme

02:03.280 --> 02:05.680
and then, you are on second? Yes.

02:06.719 --> 02:09.199
And second, overall.

02:09.240 --> 02:10.758
Beautiful. Thank you.

02:12.199 --> 02:13.800
I believe I have the hall at six.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.800
Can we not have a few more minutes?

02:15.840 --> 02:19.560
I mean, young Calvin here
has yet to rehearse.

02:19.599 --> 02:22.319
I don't need a rehearsal.
This one's a doddle.

02:22.360 --> 02:23.680
And what will you be playing?

02:25.400 --> 02:26.879
It's a surprise.

02:29.079 --> 02:31.039
Calvin, we're going home.

02:31.079 --> 02:34.800
Dr Jackson, good luck.
I'm sorry to miss it.

02:34.840 --> 02:36.120
I quite understand.

02:40.319 --> 02:44.479
Dr Jackson? Sgt Goodfellow,
Kembleford Police.

02:44.520 --> 02:48.879
You know, I knew it was you from
your book. Oh, to be recognised!

02:48.879 --> 02:50.960
I'm really looking forward
to your talk.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.599
I can't wait to read the new book.

02:54.800 --> 02:57.280
This is Inspector Mallory.

02:57.319 --> 02:59.479
It's not going
to be a long one, is it?

02:59.520 --> 03:01.319
You sound like a sceptic.

03:01.360 --> 03:04.599
I am. Then, I shall do
my best to convince you.

03:12.719 --> 03:14.639
Why wouldn't you say
what you're playing?

03:14.639 --> 03:16.039
Does it matter?

03:16.079 --> 03:18.199
A lot of people put
a lot of hard work into this

03:18.199 --> 03:20.599
and he's not taking it seriously.
It's just a bit of fun!

03:20.639 --> 03:22.639
Calvin, get in the car.

03:24.319 --> 03:27.960
I know what you're up to. I just
want to know what he's playing.

03:27.960 --> 03:30.560
You're sailing
very close to the wind.

03:30.599 --> 03:33.199
If you know what's good for you,
I'd back off!

03:36.879 --> 03:39.400
Everything all right, Rosie?

03:39.400 --> 03:40.800
We'll see tomorrow.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.840
APPLAUSE

03:46.879 --> 03:49.240
As I explain in my book,

03:49.280 --> 03:52.719
Still Waters -
A Journey Into The Deep,

03:52.759 --> 03:56.759
throughout history, human beings
have held the mistaken view

03:56.800 --> 04:00.240
that we are in control
of our experiences.

04:01.719 --> 04:04.240
What I'd like to
convince you of tonight

04:04.240 --> 04:08.199
is that we are not even
in control of our minds.

04:08.199 --> 04:09.800
You're seriously trying to tell us

04:09.840 --> 04:13.479
we're not in control
of the way we think? Yes.

04:13.479 --> 04:17.079
Your choices, your feelings,
your passions

04:17.120 --> 04:20.480
are all driven
by your subconscious mind.

04:20.480 --> 04:23.600
So, we should say
Jack the Ripper wasn't a bad man,

04:23.639 --> 04:26.839
because he had
a difficult childhood(?)

04:27.879 --> 04:30.279
Yes. In fact,
I cover that in chapter five.

04:32.360 --> 04:34.360
Codswallop.

04:34.399 --> 04:36.519
Now, may I have a volunteer?

04:37.639 --> 04:40.120
Er... Yes, thank you.

04:42.279 --> 04:45.120
Mordaunt Jackson.
Lady Felicia Montague.

04:45.159 --> 04:48.240
APPLAUSE

04:49.959 --> 04:54.079
Would you be so kind as to tell us
a little about yourself?

04:54.079 --> 04:57.120
Your hopes and fears, your interests.

04:57.120 --> 04:59.800
I hope I am charitable. Very good.

04:59.840 --> 05:01.959
What else? Hobbies, perhaps?

05:03.120 --> 05:06.639
I sing. Does that count?
Certainly. What do you sing?

05:06.680 --> 05:08.480
In the church choir.

05:08.519 --> 05:12.160
Would you be so kind
as to sing for us for now?

05:12.160 --> 05:14.160
With pleasure. What would you like?

05:14.199 --> 05:16.199
Whatever you're comfortable with.

Check all the windows, check

What can Lady Felicia's performance
tell us about her subconscious mind?

06:22.839 --> 06:24.439
Why do you like to sing?

06:25.680 --> 06:27.120
It makes me feel good.

06:28.560 --> 06:30.360
You like to entertain others.

06:31.800 --> 06:33.399
Freud would say that you require that

06:33.439 --> 06:36.079
because your subconscious mind
feels ignored.

06:36.079 --> 06:41.680
He would say that is evidence of
a personality craving attention.

06:41.720 --> 06:44.959
Perhaps you feel the need
to impress others.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.600
I see you wear a ring.

06:46.639 --> 06:49.800
My wedding ring. I notice that
you touch it when you sing.

06:49.840 --> 06:51.480
Just habit.

06:51.519 --> 06:56.120
Heh. Freud would say there are
no such things as "just habits".

06:56.159 --> 06:58.959
He would say they are evidence
of something deep-rooted.

06:59.000 --> 07:03.120
Perhaps the person you wish
to impress is your husband.

07:04.279 --> 07:06.279
He doesn't care for music.

07:06.319 --> 07:08.360
Then perhaps your singing publicly

07:08.360 --> 07:12.040
is your way of gaining the attention
that he doesn't offer.

07:17.800 --> 07:20.279
Now, we've interrogated the roots.

07:20.319 --> 07:22.120

Oh, I'm sorry if I upset you.
You didn't.

08:41.600 --> 08:43.240
I was merely trying to demonstrate...

08:43.279 --> 08:45.720
I don't mean to pop your balloon,
but I've had a sore throat

08:45.720 --> 08:48.240

08:51.559 --> 08:53.039
Goodnight.

08:55.799 --> 08:57.200
Still sceptical?

08:58.440 --> 09:00.080
If questioning a crook's roots

09:00.080 --> 09:02.320
shakes the tree enough
to get a confession,

09:02.320 --> 09:04.720
then maybe that's something
we can talk about.

09:04.759 --> 09:08.360
Then, why don't you read about it?
On the house.

09:08.399 --> 09:11.360
With respect, Doc, all this
Freud stuff's French to me.

09:11.360 --> 09:12.639
Freud was Austrian.

09:13.919 --> 09:16.080
Padre, Dr Jackson. Goodnight.

09:17.960 --> 09:18.919
May I?

09:21.879 --> 09:26.840
I've always been fascinated by
civilisation and its discontents.

09:26.879 --> 09:30.679
I'd be curious to hear how
a man of the cloth interprets Freud.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.600
Why are you in Kembleford?

09:34.600 --> 09:37.759
Publishers clamouring
for the follow-up.

09:37.759 --> 09:40.039
No rest for the wicked,
particularly in London,

09:40.080 --> 09:42.320
so I thought I'd write it here.

09:42.320 --> 09:44.960
Enjoy it. We're all flawed, Father.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.440
I suspect, even you.

09:47.799 --> 09:50.120
Would you mind...? Yes.

I am very sorry about your son,
Mr Twyman.

10:44.799 --> 10:47.879
When did you find him?
This morning, when I woke up.

10:49.480 --> 10:52.159
I came down and found him here.

10:52.200 --> 10:54.600
So sorry I'm late.

10:54.639 --> 10:56.440
Can we help you?

Mr Twyman is one of my patients.
Oh, hello, Doctor!

Good to see you again.

And Wallace here, my butler.

11:18.200 --> 11:21.879
Any sign of a break-in?
I've got this, Padre.

11:21.879 --> 11:25.440
The house was securely locked
from the inside, I made sure of it.

11:26.720 --> 11:31.279
Mr Twyman, do you know of anyone
who would want to hurt your son?

11:33.039 --> 11:34.399
Well, do you?

11:36.080 --> 11:39.519
Rosie Everton. The journalist?

11:39.519 --> 11:41.720
What's she got against your son?

11:41.759 --> 11:45.440
She thought that he was a threat
to her title in the variety show.

11:45.480 --> 11:48.120
I'm not sure she'd kill for that.

11:48.159 --> 11:50.279
GOODFELLOW: Inspector! Excuse me.

11:53.159 --> 11:54.440
Goodfellow?

11:54.480 --> 11:56.879
The butler's bag, sir.

11:56.879 --> 12:00.600
Quite a haul. WALLACE: I'll not
tell you again - get out of my way!

12:03.240 --> 12:05.919
Drop it, Wallace! I didn't hurt him!
I've known him for 20 years.

12:05.919 --> 12:09.159
He wouldn't do it. Then why is
he swinging a poker at my officers?

12:09.200 --> 12:11.600
Please, Mr Wallace. Put it down.

12:11.639 --> 12:13.840
I didn't hurt him, I swear it.

12:13.879 --> 12:17.480
I know you didn't do it, Wallace.
But this isn't the way to prove it!

12:30.639 --> 12:33.120
Printed with only hours to spare.

12:33.159 --> 12:35.559
Don't you normally sing
in this, as well, Mrs M?

12:35.600 --> 12:38.799
Given that I'm compering,
I didn't think it was appropriate.

12:38.840 --> 12:42.360
That's a shame.
It's really lovely when you sing.

12:42.360 --> 12:46.080
Oh, well. Maybe I should...
Where do I come in the programme?

12:46.120 --> 12:48.759

12:48.799 --> 12:51.840
I do hope you're recovered
from last night.

12:51.879 --> 12:54.720
Yes, thank you.
I've been resting my voice today.

12:54.720 --> 12:58.320
Oh, I heard it was
a little stage fright.

12:58.320 --> 12:59.559
Not at all.

12:59.559 --> 13:04.080
Well, that's good, because Marlon
Clifton is going to be our judge.

13:04.080 --> 13:08.320
I shall make your
perfectly-printed programme proud.

13:11.440 --> 13:13.600
Calvin Twyman won't be performing.

13:16.240 --> 13:18.720
He can't pull out now!
He's in the programme.

13:20.279 --> 13:23.440
He's dead. What?
Holy Mother of God!

13:23.480 --> 13:26.360
Strangled, while playing the piano.

13:26.360 --> 13:28.159
How bad was he? Sidney!

13:29.440 --> 13:31.200
The police have arrested the butler.

13:31.240 --> 13:33.240
Lester Wallace?

13:33.279 --> 13:35.279
I know him from The Red Lion.

13:35.320 --> 13:36.919
Beaten him a few times at poker.

13:36.960 --> 13:39.960
He pinches the family silverware
for the buy-in.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
Oh, that fits. Rumour has it,
he has light fingers.

13:43.039 --> 13:46.440
He steals the silver for gambling?!
He wins it back.

13:47.679 --> 13:50.720
Robert Twyman is pointing
the finger at Rosie Everton.

13:50.720 --> 13:52.919
Oh, Rosie wouldn't hurt a fly.

13:52.919 --> 13:55.200
She was certainly at that
boy's throat last night.

13:55.240 --> 13:57.200
Yeah, but you wouldn't
strangle someone

13:57.240 --> 13:59.240
over a little singing contest,
would you?

13:59.279 --> 14:00.600
BOTH: "Little"?!

14:02.159 --> 14:05.559
If you're going to run
after a murder,

14:05.600 --> 14:07.759
why wait until the police arrive?

14:10.519 --> 14:14.360
When we had a poke around your room,
what do you think we found...

14:15.720 --> 14:17.679
..other than your bags packed?

14:26.879 --> 14:30.120
£300...

14:30.159 --> 14:32.759
and all this silver.

14:32.799 --> 14:33.879
CLANK

14:36.039 --> 14:38.679
Why has a butler got all
this cash and valuables?

14:41.759 --> 14:45.159
I think you were flogging
the Twyman's silver.

14:45.200 --> 14:48.000
Young Calvin found out
and you kept him quiet.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.720
I want to make a confession...

14:57.000 --> 14:58.159
..to a priest.

15:03.559 --> 15:05.039
Make it quick, Padre.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.320
Mr Wallace.

15:10.159 --> 15:13.720
Bless me, Father, for I have...
changed my mind.

15:13.720 --> 15:15.440
Oh, that's disappointing.

15:15.480 --> 15:18.240
Sorry to waste your time.
That's all right.

15:18.279 --> 15:20.799
Mr Wallace, do you mind if I just...

15:20.799 --> 15:22.200
rest my legs?

15:26.720 --> 15:28.639
Bicycling.

15:28.679 --> 15:31.679
You've worked for Robert
for a long time.

15:31.720 --> 15:33.279
Yeah, I suppose I have.

15:36.279 --> 15:39.200
But you don't strike me
as the butlering sort.

15:39.240 --> 15:42.440
I've known a lot of butlers,
and they all have delicate hands -

15:42.480 --> 15:45.080
handling china cups,
that sort of thing.

15:45.120 --> 15:48.080
You make things. I did.

15:48.080 --> 15:51.600
I was an engineer.
At the aircraft factory?

15:51.600 --> 15:54.039
Yeah, I was a panel fitter.

15:54.039 --> 15:56.080
I've heard it's a RIVETING job.

15:58.320 --> 16:00.600
Did you kill Calvin?
Of course not.

16:00.639 --> 16:02.200
Why did you run?

16:02.240 --> 16:05.960
Because I've had trouble
with the police before -

16:06.000 --> 16:08.840
but I didn't kill him
and neither did Mr Twyman.

16:10.080 --> 16:13.519
But it was definitely just
you and him there? Yes.

16:15.279 --> 16:17.200
I really don't know what happened.

16:24.919 --> 16:27.600
You're not still doing that,
are you? I really don't think...

16:27.600 --> 16:30.399
Robert Twyman wants it to go ahead.

16:30.399 --> 16:32.279
What? The concert.

16:32.320 --> 16:35.039
He said "the show must go on".

16:35.080 --> 16:38.480
Now, four hands are better than two.

16:40.360 --> 16:42.559
Sid.

16:42.600 --> 16:45.200
I really do have the most
terrible scratch in my throat.

16:45.240 --> 16:49.279
What are you talking about?
You haven't shut up all morning.

16:49.320 --> 16:52.399
It comes and goes. Oh, well.

16:52.399 --> 16:53.960
If you're really feeling poorly,

16:53.960 --> 16:56.360
I suppose there's
only one thing for it.

16:56.399 --> 16:58.600
I'll take your spot in the show.

16:58.639 --> 17:01.759
I won't have you muscling in
on my limelight.

17:01.759 --> 17:03.720
Only offering to help.

17:03.720 --> 17:05.799
Of course you are(!)

17:05.839 --> 17:07.920
Sydney, I need a pineapple.

17:07.960 --> 17:09.160
A what-apple?

17:09.200 --> 17:11.799
What in heaven's name
do you need a pineapple for?

17:11.839 --> 17:15.559
It's what the professionals use.
I wouldn't expect you to understand.

17:18.118 --> 17:19.598
What's a pineapple?

17:27.880 --> 17:30.079
CLOCK CHIMES

17:36.640 --> 17:38.799
How will you manage
without Mr Wallace?

17:43.759 --> 17:46.559
Is there anything I can do to help?
No. No, thank you.

17:48.599 --> 17:52.400
We can hold the funeral as soon
as the police release the body.

17:59.480 --> 18:03.759
I don't think I have the necessary
qualifications to become a butler.

18:03.799 --> 18:05.880
What did you look for in Mr Wallace?

18:07.079 --> 18:08.440
He's loyal.

18:10.079 --> 18:12.240
Bit of a change from
being a panel fitter.

18:14.200 --> 18:17.039
It's all my fault. I...

18:17.039 --> 18:19.640
I didn't look after my boy,
I didn't protect him.

18:21.319 --> 18:23.519
You can't blame yourself.

18:23.559 --> 18:26.640
Nobody could have predicted
something like this happening.

18:26.640 --> 18:29.279
Why aren't the police
talking to her?

18:31.240 --> 18:34.480
You think it's Rosie Everton. Why?
I know how it looks.

18:34.519 --> 18:37.400
Just me and Wallace in a
locked house - but it was her.

18:37.440 --> 18:40.319
Seems a bit of a stretch...

18:40.359 --> 18:44.240
over a talent show.
You don't know what she's like.

18:44.279 --> 18:47.559
Calls herself a journalist.
She's nothing.

18:47.559 --> 18:50.359
Who gets to 35 and is still
sniffing around a local rag?

18:50.359 --> 18:52.359
I mean, look at this -

18:52.400 --> 18:56.039
Kembleford's hedge-laying champion,
front page news? It's a joke.

18:56.079 --> 18:59.279
She's just desperate for
something to say, the vulture.

18:59.319 --> 19:02.519
Would she... Would she kill,
just to make a headline?

19:04.200 --> 19:06.880
You don't know how far
she'd go to get a story.

19:10.920 --> 19:12.240
I'm sorry, I'm...

19:13.680 --> 19:15.759
You must be exhausted.

19:15.759 --> 19:16.960
I am.

19:18.160 --> 19:20.680
We'll talk about
the eulogy another time.

19:33.440 --> 19:34.559
It's for you.

19:36.599 --> 19:40.720
Goodbye, Father.
Again, my condolences.

19:44.920 --> 19:46.359
DOOR OPENS

19:48.359 --> 19:49.720

20:15.559 --> 20:17.680
Hello, Father. Hello.

20:17.720 --> 20:21.119
I just wanted to make sure that you
knew the concert was going ahead.

20:21.160 --> 20:23.319
Yes, I'd heard. Thank you.

20:25.000 --> 20:28.039
Terrible news, about the boy.
Indeed.

20:28.039 --> 20:29.759
Robert Twyman thinks you did it.

20:29.799 --> 20:31.720
SHE LAUGHS

20:34.559 --> 20:36.359
I think you'd better come inside.

20:44.519 --> 20:46.920
So, tell me exactly what Robert said.

20:48.759 --> 20:50.200
He was adamant.

20:50.200 --> 20:52.599
What, because I was so envious
of his son's great talent,

20:52.640 --> 20:54.200
I shuffled him off(?)

20:54.240 --> 20:56.680
Please(!)
Why else would he point the finger?

21:04.519 --> 21:06.039
You covered the Belcher scandal.

21:06.039 --> 21:07.440
I did.

21:07.480 --> 21:10.359
I covered business interest pieces.

21:10.359 --> 21:11.720
I read that article.

21:14.400 --> 21:15.759
It was very well-written.

21:17.160 --> 21:19.839
I won Economics Correspondent
Of The Year for it.

21:19.880 --> 21:24.559
So, why are you writing about
hedgerows for the Gazette?

21:24.559 --> 21:28.559
I just love the local issues -
more time to play the piano.

21:28.599 --> 21:31.200
And you are a composer, too?
Oh, just tinkering.

21:32.880 --> 21:35.880
In another life, I could have
been a concert pianist.

21:35.920 --> 21:39.839
Was Robert Twyman the subject
of one of your articles?

21:39.880 --> 21:42.799
Why would I be interested in him?
You tell me.

21:42.799 --> 21:45.000
He's a local hero, Father.

21:45.039 --> 21:47.640
He's a philanthropist,
a local luminary -

21:47.680 --> 21:49.559
he's a good, good man.

21:49.599 --> 21:53.759
Something tells me that
you don't believe that he is.

21:53.799 --> 21:56.000
There are some men
you just don't cross.

21:57.119 --> 21:59.880
Now, if you'll excuse me, Father,
I must rehearse.

21:59.920 --> 22:01.440
I'll see myself out.

22:10.640 --> 22:13.119
How long does it take
to find a pineapple?

22:14.319 --> 22:16.480
If you're going to sing
in this competition,

22:16.480 --> 22:18.279
you are going to have to rehearse.

22:18.279 --> 22:20.119
I can't, until I've had my juice!

22:21.599 --> 22:24.200
Well, what did Wallace have to say?

22:24.200 --> 22:25.240
Nothing.

22:27.319 --> 22:30.920
He had changed his mind about
confessing before I arrived.

22:30.960 --> 22:33.559
Did you know that Lester Wallace

22:33.599 --> 22:37.359
didn't start out working
for Robert Twyman as a butler?

22:37.359 --> 22:40.640
Before that, he worked in
Twyman's aircraft factory.

22:40.680 --> 22:42.160
Did he?

22:42.160 --> 22:46.359
If you've got everything, why
employ a panel fitter as a butler?

22:46.400 --> 22:49.480
Well, maybe he just saw
the good in the man.

22:52.319 --> 22:54.079
I think your friend Rosie

22:54.119 --> 22:56.440
was writing
a newspaper article about him

22:56.440 --> 22:58.160
and I think she was silenced.

22:58.160 --> 22:59.799
I don't think so.

22:59.799 --> 23:02.599
Rosie Everton is one of the
most formidable women I know.

23:02.640 --> 23:05.880
I hardly think a man like that
could silence a woman like her.

23:05.880 --> 23:08.880
Anyway, she was
a leading journalist. Was.

23:08.920 --> 23:11.359
Well, she chose to pursue the piano.

23:11.400 --> 23:15.160
Can't begrudge a woman for pursuing
her dreams, can you, Father?

23:16.240 --> 23:17.240
I'm not.

23:18.519 --> 23:22.599
I'm just suggesting that
Robert Twyman may have influenced

23:22.640 --> 23:23.839
her career change.

23:23.880 --> 23:26.400
Let me speak to her.
I'll see what I can find out.

23:26.400 --> 23:29.000
I've known her an awfully long time.
Thank you.

23:29.039 --> 23:31.240
You are meant to be rehearsing!

23:31.279 --> 23:35.599
No note shall come out of my mouth
until I have my pineapple juice!

KNOCKS AT DOOR

23:57.200 --> 23:58.480
Hello?

24:06.039 --> 24:07.400
Robert?

24:13.960 --> 24:15.680
SHE SCREAMS

24:19.960 --> 24:22.039
Can I have my book back now, sir?

24:23.359 --> 24:27.759
I'm reading the chapter
on self-interest, Goodfellow.

24:27.759 --> 24:29.960
Do you have a problem with sharing?

24:30.000 --> 24:32.359
No. Good.

24:32.400 --> 24:35.640
Seems like Twyman's
bought Wallace an expensive lawyer.

24:35.680 --> 24:38.720
Doesn't matter. See, there were
two people in that house...

24:38.720 --> 24:39.960
PHONE RINGS

24:39.960 --> 24:42.759
..Wallace and Twyman.

24:42.799 --> 24:46.240
And Twyman has no motive.

24:46.240 --> 24:48.039
Kembleford Police.

24:48.079 --> 24:51.880
I don't need to read this book
to know what a murderer looks like -

24:51.920 --> 24:54.920
and our murderer looks like Wallace.

24:54.960 --> 24:56.160
Sir?

24:57.240 --> 24:58.680
Lady Felicia.

25:02.480 --> 25:03.599
Hello.

25:10.680 --> 25:14.640
What were you doing in
Rosie Everton's house, Mr Twyman?

25:16.720 --> 25:18.079
Did you argue?

25:21.160 --> 25:23.799
Then, how come she ended up dead,
Mr Twyman?

25:23.799 --> 25:25.160
I don't know.

25:28.400 --> 25:31.920
Did you kill Rosie Everton
and did you kill your son, too?

25:33.960 --> 25:36.119
I had a dream... Speak up!

25:37.440 --> 25:39.039
I had a dream that I did.

25:41.279 --> 25:43.079
A dream?

25:43.119 --> 25:45.799
KNOCKS AT DOOR
DOOR OPENS

25:45.839 --> 25:47.720
Father Brown, for Mr Twyman.

25:50.359 --> 25:51.640
Fine.

25:53.079 --> 25:54.880
Get me the shrink.

26:01.160 --> 26:03.200
She was just lying there. When?

26:05.480 --> 26:06.599
When I woke up.

26:08.720 --> 26:10.920
I knocked...

26:10.920 --> 26:14.160
She was playing the piano,
she couldn't hear, so I went in...

26:15.599 --> 26:17.799
..and the next thing
I remember is...

26:20.920 --> 26:22.079
..she's dead.

26:24.759 --> 26:26.920
She died while playing the piano?

26:28.920 --> 26:30.559
How can I not remember?

26:32.480 --> 26:34.480
You received a letter, when I left.

26:37.359 --> 26:39.240
Yes. What did it say?

26:40.920 --> 26:44.799
"If you don't confess,
you will die today."

26:44.839 --> 26:46.160
Confess to what?

26:49.519 --> 26:50.759
Who's threatening you?

26:50.759 --> 26:52.920
Her. She was.

26:54.200 --> 26:56.079
That's why I went to confront her.

26:57.440 --> 27:01.119
Was Rosie Everton writing
a newspaper article about you?

27:03.759 --> 27:06.200
How can I not remember
killing my son?

27:09.640 --> 27:11.000
How, indeed.

27:14.920 --> 27:18.039
Dr Jackson. Ah. I came
as quickly as I could.

27:18.079 --> 27:20.200
We've caught our killer.

27:20.240 --> 27:21.640
Who is it?

27:21.640 --> 27:23.200
Robert Twyman.

27:23.240 --> 27:26.480
Robert Twyman killed his own son?

27:26.519 --> 27:28.440
And he's just killed someone else.

27:29.880 --> 27:33.200
Who? Rosie Everton,
a local journalist -

27:33.200 --> 27:35.200
killed at her piano.

27:35.240 --> 27:36.240
Oh, my dear Lord!

27:37.680 --> 27:41.119
Did you know Rosie?
No, no, I didn't.

27:41.160 --> 27:43.599
The man's completely lost his head.

27:43.599 --> 27:45.759
I'm going to need you
to screw it back on,

27:45.799 --> 27:48.200
so he can start giving answers.

27:48.240 --> 27:50.440
What if he doesn't know the answers?

27:50.480 --> 27:53.920
We caught him red-handed, Padre.
He did it.

27:53.960 --> 27:55.279
Yes, but why?

27:57.000 --> 27:59.640
Inspector, I think you need
to keep an eye on him.

28:01.240 --> 28:03.039
I believe his life is in danger.

28:03.079 --> 28:05.680
What are you talking about?

28:05.720 --> 28:09.799
He received a letter,
threatening his life.

28:09.799 --> 28:12.599
So, he's going to be murdered,
as well?

28:12.599 --> 28:14.160
Apparently so.

28:14.160 --> 28:16.440
Wouldn't it be better
to err on the side of caution?

28:16.480 --> 28:18.960
Unless the murderer wants to
break into a police station,

28:18.960 --> 28:21.319
I think he'll be safe for now.
Dr Jackson?

28:23.039 --> 28:24.480
Off you pop, Padre.

29:00.599 --> 29:01.920
DOOR SHUTS

29:38.160 --> 29:41.160
I've come to a decision.
Oh, here we go.

29:41.200 --> 29:43.480
I've decided not to sing.

29:43.519 --> 29:45.039
Rosie was a dear friend

29:45.039 --> 29:49.240
and it feels disrespectful
to sing in her absence.

29:49.279 --> 29:51.720
But that's three performers
out of the running!

29:51.759 --> 29:55.359
At this rate, all we'll be left
with will be Mungo Hooter!

29:55.400 --> 29:57.200
I'm afraid that's my final decision.

29:57.240 --> 29:59.359
DOOR OPENS
A-ha!

30:02.200 --> 30:05.319
I've got it! Well, she's only
gone and thrown in the towel.

30:05.359 --> 30:08.240
Whoa, whoa! I've been halfway
to Hereford for this thing.

30:08.240 --> 30:10.400
Now you're telling me
you don't want it?

30:10.440 --> 30:13.440
Well, my voice is ruined
by screaming, anyway.

30:13.480 --> 30:15.680
There is nothing wrong
with your throat.

30:15.720 --> 30:18.480
This is about what happened
last night, isn't it?

30:18.480 --> 30:21.599
You are scared of making
a fool of yourself...again.

30:21.599 --> 30:23.599
No, I'm not. Yes, you are.

30:26.680 --> 30:29.279
Bring it back when it's pulped.
When it's what?

30:29.319 --> 30:31.160
Extract the juice, Sidney.

30:48.599 --> 30:52.079
I'm afraid Robert
is a deeply-disturbed man.

30:53.200 --> 30:56.960
It's quite clear
he's collapsing into himself.

30:58.359 --> 31:00.480
Well, what do you suggest?

31:02.000 --> 31:05.839
Well, there is a method in my book
I've explored, but it's a long shot.

31:06.880 --> 31:11.319
We need to calm him,
bring him back around.

31:12.960 --> 31:17.680
I have conducted several experiments
that demonstrate that classical music

31:17.680 --> 31:21.720
can draw a patient with this
kind of psychiatric collapse

31:21.720 --> 31:23.119
back into cogency.

31:24.759 --> 31:27.119
It might just be enough
for a confession.

31:29.279 --> 31:31.440
What do you need for it?

31:31.480 --> 31:34.119
A simple record player should do.

31:34.119 --> 31:36.359
I could have one brought over.

31:36.359 --> 31:41.599
I know it's unorthodox,
but I think it's worth a shot.

31:41.640 --> 31:43.039
What do we have to lose?

31:49.160 --> 31:51.839
I can't believe he killed his son.
Neither can I.

31:53.640 --> 31:55.720
I think you two
were working together.

31:55.759 --> 31:58.480
I think you were going
to confess and he got to you

31:58.519 --> 32:00.079
and convinced you to keep quiet.

32:00.119 --> 32:02.279
What I don't understand is,

32:02.319 --> 32:04.160
why were you sending the letters?

32:04.200 --> 32:05.799
I didn't send the letters.

32:07.559 --> 32:09.839
I think I know why
Robert killed Rosie,

32:09.880 --> 32:13.119
but perhaps you can help me to
understand why you killed Calvin.

32:13.119 --> 32:14.720
I didn't kill Calvin!

32:16.640 --> 32:18.559
I can only assume...

32:20.200 --> 32:22.400
..that it was
because of the aircraft.

32:29.200 --> 32:31.920
Rosie Everton may have been sacked
from the broadsheets,

32:31.920 --> 32:34.559
but she was a brilliant journalist.

32:34.559 --> 32:38.319
Brilliant journalists don't need
to break the Official Secrets Act

32:38.319 --> 32:39.480
to get their stories.

32:39.519 --> 32:42.720
That's hardly a crime, compared
with what you and Robert did.

32:42.759 --> 32:46.480
We were found innocent.
No, you weren't convicted.

32:49.079 --> 32:52.119
You knew you were
fitting faulty parts.

32:52.119 --> 32:54.680
But you put profit over safety.

32:56.799 --> 32:58.839
When did Calvin find out?

32:58.839 --> 33:00.440
I... I don't think he did.

33:02.079 --> 33:04.559
Then, why kill him? I didn't!

33:04.599 --> 33:06.920
Only you and Robert
were in the house.

33:06.960 --> 33:08.920
The door was locked from the inside.

33:11.799 --> 33:14.839
We weren't the only ones here.
But it can't have been her.

33:16.519 --> 33:19.400
Rosie Everton.
'She was only here a few minutes.'

33:21.799 --> 33:24.720
'After I'd locked up the house,
I cooked the Twymans their dinner.

33:24.720 --> 33:26.799
'Whilst they were eating,
I led her in.

33:26.799 --> 33:29.279
'She copied it down and left.'

33:29.279 --> 33:30.680
She copied the music?

33:32.119 --> 33:34.160
Why did you let her in?

33:34.200 --> 33:36.680
I wanted to keep her on our side.

33:36.720 --> 33:40.359
She might have lost her job,
but she still knew our secrets.

33:40.359 --> 33:42.960
Calvin had been promised
he'd be told in advance

33:43.000 --> 33:45.920
what the head judges'
favourite piece of music was.

33:45.960 --> 33:47.920
He was a deeply-unpleasant boy.

33:47.960 --> 33:52.000
I thought she might like to know
in advance what advantage he had.

33:52.039 --> 33:56.240
So, I invited her over. How was
Calvin promised the inside track?

33:56.279 --> 33:58.720
The head judge is one
of Dr Jackson's patients.

33:58.759 --> 34:01.759
The man knows everyone.
Said he'd just call and ask.

34:03.400 --> 34:06.200
APPLAUSE

34:07.480 --> 34:11.079
Welcome to the
Kembleford Variety Show.

34:11.119 --> 34:14.239
Due to certain tragic circumstances,

34:14.280 --> 34:16.440
there are some changes
in the programme,

34:16.440 --> 34:20.800
but as we say, the show must go on!

34:20.800 --> 34:24.518
So, without further ado,
would you please welcome...

34:24.559 --> 34:27.840
Is that it?
Big fruit, not a lot of juice.

34:27.880 --> 34:31.280
..Mungo Hooter and his six shooter!
GUNSHOTS

34:33.800 --> 34:35.119
KNOCKS AT DOOR

34:39.360 --> 34:42.119
Do you have a moment, Doctor?
Of course.

34:47.199 --> 34:48.518
May I?

34:48.518 --> 34:49.679
Please.

34:54.239 --> 34:56.840
Ooh! Knees.

34:56.840 --> 34:58.639
Not your speciality, I know.

35:06.679 --> 35:09.000
I read your book
from cover to cover.

35:12.079 --> 35:16.719
The other day, I was trying
to remember my father's face

35:16.760 --> 35:19.800
and you wrote that
I should remember in context,

35:19.800 --> 35:23.039
so I thought
of a favourite hymn of his -

35:23.039 --> 35:24.440
and there he was.

35:25.480 --> 35:27.079
As clear as day.

35:27.119 --> 35:29.480
I'm glad you found it therapeutic.

35:29.519 --> 35:31.880
I admire your work.

35:31.880 --> 35:36.079
I admire the methods you use
to treat vulnerable minds.

35:36.079 --> 35:37.440
Thank you.

35:37.480 --> 35:42.400
But I am troubled that you might
be using your methods for ill.

35:42.440 --> 35:46.159
I apologise again,
if I embarrassed your friend.

35:46.199 --> 35:48.199
I'm not talking about Lady Felicia.

35:50.280 --> 35:52.079
I'm talking about Robert Twyman.

35:52.119 --> 35:54.880
I believe that you put
the weapon into his hands.

35:56.159 --> 35:57.719
What do you mean?

35:57.760 --> 36:00.360
I'm not suggesting
that you committed the murders.

36:02.039 --> 36:04.480
I am suggesting
that you are responsible.

36:06.519 --> 36:07.440
How?

36:09.760 --> 36:10.920
Hypnotism.

36:12.960 --> 36:16.039
You cover it in great detail -
chapter nine.

36:17.679 --> 36:21.760
# Dear Lord and Father of mankind

36:21.760 --> 36:25.159
♪ Forgive our foolish ways. ♪

36:27.440 --> 36:28.440
And there he is...

36:29.880 --> 36:31.039
..my old dad.

36:32.719 --> 36:36.760
Just that melody connects me
to such a clear vision -

36:36.760 --> 36:38.360
and that's it, isn't it?

36:40.840 --> 36:42.639
Music is the murder weapon.

36:42.639 --> 36:44.480
CALVIN PLAYS CHOPIN

36:44.519 --> 36:47.480
Calvin died
because you sent him music,

36:47.480 --> 36:51.159
with the promise that
it would win the competition.
CALVIN CHOKES

36:51.199 --> 36:54.320
You knew he would practise it
in front of his father.

36:54.360 --> 36:55.679
And that...

36:56.800 --> 36:58.440
..would trigger his murder.

36:59.440 --> 37:01.320
But what you couldn't know

37:01.360 --> 37:03.760
is that Rosie Everton
would copy the music...

37:03.800 --> 37:05.039
ROSIE PLAYS CHOPIN

37:05.039 --> 37:07.000
..and would be playing it

37:07.039 --> 37:10.880
when Robert Twyman
visited her this morning.

37:12.159 --> 37:15.480
Both of them were murdered because
you had hypnotised Robert to kill

37:15.480 --> 37:18.519
when he heard that
particular piece of music.

37:20.960 --> 37:23.280
And why would I do such a thing?

37:23.320 --> 37:24.360
Vengeance.

37:26.360 --> 37:29.039
Did Rosie come to you
with the information

37:29.079 --> 37:31.159
she had about the cover-up?

37:31.199 --> 37:32.679
I...don't follow.

37:32.679 --> 37:36.079
Perhaps because she knew
that your son had died

37:36.119 --> 37:39.239
at the controls of one
of Twyman's faulty aircraft.

37:41.400 --> 37:42.559
Is that your son?

37:46.519 --> 37:49.559
I don't believe you're in
Kembleford to write a book.

37:49.599 --> 37:53.320
I think you are here to exact
revenge on Robert Twyman.

37:54.599 --> 37:57.199
You sent him letters to unsettle him

37:57.199 --> 37:59.920
and you dangled your services
in front of him,

37:59.920 --> 38:02.679
pretending that you could
give him some peace.

38:05.559 --> 38:07.719
But why toy with him?

38:07.719 --> 38:09.320
Why not just expose him?

38:10.400 --> 38:11.840
I wanted him to confess.

38:13.280 --> 38:16.519
To feel the pain of what
it's like to lose your own son.

38:16.519 --> 38:18.719
And how do you feel
about Rosie's death?

38:20.760 --> 38:23.679
She did her best
to get justice for your son.

38:23.719 --> 38:27.280
She lost her job,
then she lost her life.

38:27.280 --> 38:29.239
I... I'm sorry about that.

38:31.159 --> 38:33.039
Then, confess.

38:33.079 --> 38:35.559
He's the one that has to confess.

38:35.599 --> 38:37.400
That's between him and God.

38:37.440 --> 38:39.639
Vengeance doesn't bring peace.

38:42.320 --> 38:44.519
Then...what does?

38:46.800 --> 38:48.760
Forgiveness.

38:48.800 --> 38:50.280
I fear it may be too late.

38:54.159 --> 38:55.519
What do you mean?

38:58.559 --> 38:59.960
The music...

39:03.639 --> 39:05.920
Well, let's hope
this does the trick.

40:17.039 --> 40:20.679
I know.
But that awful man was right.

40:20.719 --> 40:23.039
I do just sing for attention.

40:23.079 --> 40:25.199
And? I should sing for myself.

40:25.239 --> 40:27.119
Well, go out there and do it.

40:27.159 --> 40:28.920
But what if I can't?

40:28.960 --> 40:33.199
Lady Felicia, I really hate
to be the person to tell you this,

40:33.239 --> 40:37.519
but you have one of the most
beautiful voices I have ever heard.

40:37.519 --> 40:40.480
Oh. Really?

40:40.519 --> 40:45.039
Really.
So, go out there and do us proud.

41:03.679 --> 41:07.800
Have you got a minute?
Er, not really. Needed in London.

41:07.840 --> 41:09.320
What a shame.

41:09.360 --> 41:12.800
We were enjoying getting to
know you, weren't we, Goodfellow?

41:12.800 --> 41:14.039
Can't be helped.

41:14.079 --> 41:17.800
Before you go, would you mind
coming in and talking to us

41:17.800 --> 41:21.079
about the murders of Calvin Twyman
and Rosie Everton?

41:21.119 --> 41:25.199
We'd like to hear a psychoanalyst's
view on the matter.

41:25.239 --> 41:27.199
Of course. I'll follow you in my car.

41:27.239 --> 41:28.800
No.

41:28.840 --> 41:30.679
Let me give you a ride.

41:32.719 --> 41:34.760
By the way, that music you gave us

41:34.760 --> 41:37.800
didn't quite have the
soothing effect one might expect.

41:39.239 --> 41:40.440
Oh, dear.

41:40.480 --> 41:42.960
But it certainly
helped Robert open up.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.719
He's singing like a canary.

41:47.360 --> 41:49.599
