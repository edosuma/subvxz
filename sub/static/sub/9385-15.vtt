Alan Adler, David Preshlack,
Julie Axelrod

00:33.951 --> 00:35.619
Shep Sutton, Scott McCormick.

00:35.702 --> 00:37.746
And that concludes the list
of people who were mean to me

00:37.829 --> 00:38.872
in junior high.

00:38.956 --> 00:40.165
Tomorrow, high school.

00:40.249 --> 00:42.709
Finally, we go to Asian Reporter
Tricia Takanawa

00:42.793 --> 00:44.044
for 60 seconds of filler.

00:44.127 --> 00:45.170
Thanks, Tom.

00:45.254 --> 00:46.880
I'm here on
Spooner Street

00:46.964 --> 00:48.590
where several
Quahog families

00:48.674 --> 00:50.300
are holding a car wash

00:50.384 --> 00:51.593
to raise money

00:51.677 --> 00:53.720
for an organ transplant
for young Paul Lewis.

00:53.804 --> 00:55.848
So, what do you call
this device, Paul?

00:55.931 --> 00:57.933
It's an iron lung.
It keeps me from dying.

00:58.016 --> 01:00.227
I want to play baseball!

01:00.310 --> 01:03.939
And with me is one of Paul's
classmates, Chris Griffin

01:04.022 --> 01:06.108
who helped organize
this charity event.

01:06.191 --> 01:08.277
You're a very thoughtful
young man, Chris.

01:08.360 --> 01:10.070
C-can I say hello
to my mom?

01:10.153 --> 01:11.196
Sure.

01:11.280 --> 01:12.406
Hi, Mom!

01:12.489 --> 01:13.907
Hi, sweetheart.

01:13.991 --> 01:16.326
Okay, so you want
the full wash, and, uh...

01:16.410 --> 01:17.494
oh, you got a nick there.

01:17.578 --> 01:19.162
I can probably
get that out for you.

01:19.246 --> 01:21.498
Now, if you want
to go with a scent

01:21.582 --> 01:24.334
I've got "PB and J," "Sugar
Cereal," and "New Toy."

01:24.418 --> 01:26.044
What the deuce?

01:26.128 --> 01:28.547
Hey, somebody dropped
their money clip.

01:28.630 --> 01:29.756
Wow, $26.

01:29.840 --> 01:33.427
I've never seen
so much money at one time!

01:33.510 --> 01:35.179
What do you think
we should do with it?

01:35.262 --> 01:39.349
I say we buy $26 worth
of ice cream and just pig out.

01:39.433 --> 01:41.351
Oh, we can dish, talk about
who's getting fat--

01:41.435 --> 01:43.312
oh, we'll just be
great big bitches.

01:43.395 --> 01:45.397
Hold on, kids, that's
not your money yet.

01:45.480 --> 01:47.900
The law says you got to put
up signs and wait two weeks

01:47.983 --> 01:48.984
for someone
to claim it.

01:49.067 --> 01:51.320
If no one does,
it's yours.

01:51.403 --> 01:53.614
Ah, lunch is here.

01:56.158 --> 01:57.993
Everyone,
we've reached our goal.

01:58.076 --> 02:02.164
It looks like somebody's
going to live to see puberty.

02:02.247 --> 02:03.415
Oh, my God, that man
just took our money!

02:03.498 --> 02:05.000
What man?

02:05.083 --> 02:06.418
He-he was a wearing
a Jimmy Carter mask

02:06.502 --> 02:08.045
like that robber
in the Keanu Reeves movie.

02:08.128 --> 02:09.129
The Matrix.

02:09.296 --> 02:10.589
No, no, no.
It wasn't that recent.

02:10.672 --> 02:12.424
The one where they're
jumping out of the plane.

02:12.508 --> 02:13.675
Executive Decision?

02:13.759 --> 02:14.968
No, that was
with Kurt Russell.

02:15.052 --> 02:16.261
But-but the other guy
in this movie

02:16.345 --> 02:17.554
he kind of looks
like Kurt Russell.

02:17.638 --> 02:18.639
He's getting away!

02:18.722 --> 02:20.516
Don't worry. He won't get far.

02:20.599 --> 02:21.600
( sirens blare )

02:21.683 --> 02:24.061
Stop! Police!

02:46.500 --> 02:48.335
( panting )

02:51.880 --> 02:54.341
( gasping )

02:55.551 --> 02:56.552
Joe, what happened?

02:56.635 --> 02:58.262
I got the money...

02:58.345 --> 02:59.346
( cheering )

02:59.471 --> 03:00.806
but I lost the perp.

03:00.889 --> 03:03.058
Well, the money's
the important thing.

03:03.141 --> 03:04.142
Now little Paul
can get his...

03:04.226 --> 03:06.270
Point Break!
That was the movie!

03:08.647 --> 03:12.067
Here's to Joe, who helped
little Paul get a new liver

03:12.234 --> 03:14.653
and, barring
a massive infection

03:14.736 --> 03:16.697
a new lease on life.

03:16.780 --> 03:18.365
Don't you understand?

03:18.490 --> 03:19.908
I lost the perp.

03:19.992 --> 03:22.661
I lost the perp!

03:22.744 --> 03:25.247
( sobbing )

03:49.980 --> 03:53.483
( continues sobbing )

04:22.471 --> 04:24.223
MEG:
So, um, the $26

04:24.306 --> 04:26.183
would probably
be safe in my room.

04:26.266 --> 04:27.893
( scoffing ):
Right-- it'd probably get lost

04:27.976 --> 04:29.686
among the pinups
of Justin Timberlake

04:29.770 --> 04:32.022
and Tom Cruise and... oh, blast

04:32.105 --> 04:34.691
who the devil
do the teenagers like?

04:34.816 --> 04:37.319
Um, Morgan Freeman.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.446
Well, we can't
keep it in my room

04:39.530 --> 04:40.989
'cause there's
an evil monkey

04:41.073 --> 04:42.241
that lives
in my closet.

04:45.118 --> 04:48.413
You know, the sad part is,
he wasn't always evil.

04:48.497 --> 04:50.832
Honey, good news!

04:50.916 --> 04:52.584
I made partner!

04:54.169 --> 04:56.421
( screeching )

04:56.505 --> 04:59.299
( all screeching )

05:01.426 --> 05:03.887
Peter, Bonnie says Joe's
been really depressed

05:03.971 --> 05:05.138
about that robbery.

05:05.222 --> 05:07.099
Why don't you go
talk to him?

05:07.182 --> 05:08.976
Well, I don't know.
There's a game on.

05:09.059 --> 05:10.477
Shame on you.

05:10.561 --> 05:13.146
You march right over there
and cheer your old friend up.

05:13.230 --> 05:14.314
Don't listen
to that sissy.

05:14.398 --> 05:16.066
Grab a beer and
watch the game.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.150
Yeah, that sounds good.

05:17.276 --> 05:18.360
( gunshot )

05:18.443 --> 05:19.444
Oh, my God!

05:19.528 --> 05:20.946
Now, get your fat ass
over to Joe's.

05:21.029 --> 05:22.072
Look, buddy, I-I...
Move!

05:22.155 --> 05:23.907
All right, all right,
just take it easy, man.

05:23.991 --> 05:24.992
Everything's cool.

05:26.451 --> 05:27.703
Hey, buddy.

05:27.786 --> 05:29.329
Close the door.

05:29.413 --> 05:31.707
I don't want to
see the light.

05:31.790 --> 05:33.166
Oh, come on, Joe,
cheer up, huh?

05:33.250 --> 05:35.878
Hey, hey, what do you say
you and me go rollerska...

05:35.961 --> 05:37.171
Bike rid...

05:37.254 --> 05:39.006
Jump ro...

05:39.089 --> 05:41.592
Go lay on the grass?

05:41.675 --> 05:43.760
Peter, the other day
was the first time

05:43.844 --> 05:45.470
I've ever lost a perp.

05:45.554 --> 05:48.223
It was also the first time I've
ever really felt handicapped.

05:48.307 --> 05:50.100
I've made up my
mind about this.

05:50.184 --> 05:51.977
I'm quitting the force.

05:52.060 --> 05:54.521
Oh, come on, Joe, you don't
have to quit the force.

05:54.605 --> 05:59.902
You could get a desk job.
Eh? You-you could be a desk.

05:59.985 --> 06:02.154
Forget it. I'm washed up.

06:02.237 --> 06:04.740
In local news, Quahog
will soon play proud host

06:04.823 --> 06:06.450
to the Special People's Games.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.243
If you and-or a friend
are disabled

06:08.327 --> 06:09.703
and would like
to challenge yourself

06:09.786 --> 06:11.538
and raise your self-esteem,
sign up today.

06:11.622 --> 06:13.165
Joe, that's it.

06:13.248 --> 06:15.584
You got to compete in the
Special People's Games.

06:15.667 --> 06:17.169
Gosh, I-I don't
know, Peter.

06:17.252 --> 06:18.712
You really think I can?

06:18.795 --> 06:20.631
Hey, I'm the guy that believed you
could be a desk, eh?

06:20.714 --> 06:22.174
Come on, I'll even
be your coach.

06:22.257 --> 06:24.760
Well, all right.
Let's do it!

06:24.843 --> 06:27.095
Coming up in this half hour,
our undercover exposé

06:27.179 --> 06:29.848
on conveniently placed news
reports in television shows.

06:29.932 --> 06:31.850
But first-- Peter, look out
for that skateboard.

06:31.934 --> 06:32.976
( screaming )

06:41.443 --> 06:43.403
Had a bit of a row
with a fellow in the steam room.

06:43.487 --> 06:44.488
You don't say?

06:44.571 --> 06:45.656
Gave him
a cauliflower ear.

06:45.739 --> 06:46.990
Bully!

06:47.074 --> 06:48.617
Come on, come on.
Come on, two more!

06:48.700 --> 06:50.494
Peter, you're pushing me
too hard.

06:50.577 --> 06:52.829
Oh, trust me, Joe.
I know physical fitness.

06:52.913 --> 06:55.707
I was in Richard Simmons'
Sweating to Books on Tape.

06:55.791 --> 06:58.961
SOMBER VOICE: The Red Sox
were in town, but I didn't care

06:59.044 --> 07:00.420
because it was Tuesday

07:00.504 --> 07:02.506
and I was on my way
to see Maury.

07:02.589 --> 07:05.300
He couldn't go to the bathroom
by himself anymore

07:05.384 --> 07:07.177
but his indomitable spirit...

07:09.263 --> 07:10.973
So, how's he
checked out, Doc?

07:11.056 --> 07:12.808
Is my boy ready to compete?

07:12.891 --> 07:16.687
Um, I don't quite know how
to tell you this, Mr. Swanson.

07:16.770 --> 07:19.106
You're paralyzed
from the waist down.

07:19.189 --> 07:20.566
I know.

07:20.649 --> 07:22.568
Oh, thank God!

07:22.651 --> 07:23.819
( laughing )

07:23.902 --> 07:26.071
Oh, God, I was standing
out there

07:26.154 --> 07:27.573
( laughing ): for, like, ten minutes.
I... I...

07:27.656 --> 07:28.824
Whew!

07:28.907 --> 07:30.868
Boy, is that a load off!

07:32.786 --> 07:34.913
Hey, Mort, Joe here is
going to be competing

07:34.997 --> 07:36.331
in the Special
People's Games.

07:36.415 --> 07:37.541
You got anything

07:37.624 --> 07:38.917
that might give him
a little extra juice?

07:39.001 --> 07:40.169
You mean steroids?

07:40.252 --> 07:42.921
But, Peter, haven't
you seen what happens

07:43.005 --> 07:44.381
to those ladies
on ESPN2?

07:44.464 --> 07:45.966
They get big hair faces

07:46.049 --> 07:48.802
and their breasts
become like flapjacks!

07:48.886 --> 07:51.305
I-I was thinking more
like a protein shake.

07:51.388 --> 07:53.724
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.684
Aisle three,
next to the creams.

07:55.767 --> 07:57.686
Ooh, I don't like
saying that word.

07:59.188 --> 08:02.024
ANNOUNCER: We now return
to Touched by an Angel.

08:02.191 --> 08:04.693
Now, where exactly
did the angel touch you?

08:04.860 --> 08:06.445
Here?

08:06.528 --> 08:08.322
Oh, come on, who you
going to believe?

08:08.405 --> 08:09.406
I got a freakin' halo!

08:09.489 --> 08:10.908
Shh, shh...

08:10.991 --> 08:12.743
Bye, I'm going to the mall.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.453
What are you going
to the mall for?

08:14.536 --> 08:17.164
Don't worry.
The $26 is safe.

08:17.247 --> 08:18.540
Safe, huh?

08:18.624 --> 08:19.958
The skirt's trying
to pull a fast one.

08:20.042 --> 08:21.084
Knuckles, get the handbag.

08:21.168 --> 08:22.753
Right, boss!

08:22.836 --> 08:24.463
Hey, give me my purse,
you psycho!

08:24.546 --> 08:27.716
Let's see... makeup,
chewing gum, a picture of Meg

08:27.799 --> 08:28.967
in a two-piece swimsuit...

08:29.051 --> 08:32.888
Oh! God, I pray
this is not my first memory.

08:32.971 --> 08:34.389
Look, everybody, cool it.

08:34.473 --> 08:36.016
I'm not putting up with
this racket for two weeks.

08:36.099 --> 08:37.309
I'll hold on
to the money.

08:37.392 --> 08:39.186
I'm a neutral party,
so it'll be safe.

08:39.269 --> 08:40.938
Okay.
All right.

08:41.021 --> 08:42.064
I suppose
we can trust you.

08:42.147 --> 08:43.148
Now, where is it?

08:43.232 --> 08:44.608
What the... ?

08:44.691 --> 08:46.443
Oh, very clever.

08:46.527 --> 08:48.779
Take another reach,
you forgot your change.

08:52.449 --> 08:55.327
Hello, and welcome to the Quahog
Special People's Games.

08:55.410 --> 08:56.411
I'm Tom Tucker.

08:56.495 --> 08:57.996
And I'm Diane Simmons.

08:58.080 --> 09:00.415
It's a great day to be alive, Tom,
able-bodied or not.

09:00.499 --> 09:01.834
It sure is, Diane.

09:01.917 --> 09:04.294
Today we'll see some
of Quahog's finest athletes

09:04.378 --> 09:06.797
struggle valiantly against
God's twisted designs.

09:06.922 --> 09:08.048
You'll cheer, you'll cry

09:08.173 --> 09:09.925
you might even get
a cheap laugh or two.

09:10.008 --> 09:11.385
I know I will, Tom.

09:11.468 --> 09:13.303
In fact, there's
the distinct possibility

09:13.387 --> 09:15.430
that by the end of the day,
we'll all be going to hell.

09:15.514 --> 09:17.432
I'll see you there, Diane.

09:17.516 --> 09:19.810
Oh, it sounds like
the opening ceremonies have begun.

09:19.893 --> 09:22.563
There are the paraplegics...

09:22.646 --> 09:24.314
Followed by the blind team...

09:26.525 --> 09:28.443
Still no sign
of the deaf team, I noticed...

09:28.527 --> 09:29.903
( knocking )

09:29.987 --> 09:31.113
( phone ringing )

09:31.196 --> 09:32.781
( alarm buzzing )

09:32.865 --> 09:34.157
MAN: Hey, you guys
aregoing to be late!

09:34.241 --> 09:35.909
MAN 2:
Maybe they're not in there.

09:35.993 --> 09:38.495
DIANE:
And now, we turn our attention

09:38.579 --> 09:41.832
to the lighting of the flame.

09:41.915 --> 09:43.834
TOM:
And these games are under way!

09:43.917 --> 09:46.378
We begin with the 100-meter dash

09:46.461 --> 09:48.672
for people
afraid of yellow tape.

09:48.755 --> 09:49.756
( cheering )

09:52.801 --> 09:54.720
DIANE:
It's anybody's race now, Tom.

09:54.887 --> 09:55.888
( screaming )

09:55.971 --> 09:59.099
And it's Odai Mutumbo
of Kenya.

09:59.183 --> 10:00.851
Decathlon... I don't know.

10:00.934 --> 10:03.103
That's quite a mountain
to climb, Peter.

10:03.187 --> 10:05.522
Joe, look at me.
Look at me.

10:05.606 --> 10:06.857
Do I have food
in my teeth?

10:07.024 --> 10:08.066
No.

10:08.150 --> 10:09.401
Oh, great.
Thank God.

10:09.484 --> 10:10.611
Now-now listen
here, Joe.

10:10.694 --> 10:12.529
You and I both know
you have what it takes

10:12.613 --> 10:13.780
to win this thing.

10:13.864 --> 10:15.699
So get out there
and do it, huh?

10:15.782 --> 10:18.243
( computer voice ): The gold medal
is mine, pretty boy.

10:18.327 --> 10:19.828
You don't have a chance in hell.

10:19.912 --> 10:21.371
He may be right, Peter.

10:21.455 --> 10:22.539
Joe, he's an android.

10:22.623 --> 10:23.916
Don't let him
push you around.

10:23.999 --> 10:25.918
You can do this.
I know you can.

10:26.001 --> 10:27.711
Yeah. Yeah!

10:27.794 --> 10:29.338
Hey, you think
you're so hot, fellow?

10:29.421 --> 10:30.756
Well, at least I can do this.

10:30.839 --> 10:33.425
( singing scales )

10:33.509 --> 10:35.677
( singing one note repeatedly )

10:35.761 --> 10:36.803
Oh, crap.

10:36.887 --> 10:38.055
Let's do it!

10:38.138 --> 10:39.223
TOM:
Let's go to the first

10:39.306 --> 10:40.307
decathlon event of the day:

10:40.390 --> 10:41.850
the pole vault,
where Joe Swanson takes

10:41.934 --> 10:44.311
his starting position.

10:47.272 --> 10:48.482
( cheering and applause )

10:48.565 --> 10:50.025
Way to go, Joe!

10:50.108 --> 10:51.151
Yeah!

10:51.235 --> 10:52.611
How do you like that, buddy?

10:52.694 --> 10:53.904
The sphincter says what?

10:53.987 --> 10:55.030
What?

10:55.113 --> 10:56.114
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

10:56.198 --> 10:57.282
You stupid bastard.

11:01.203 --> 11:03.789
Oh, good to see your
new fiscal responsibilities

11:03.914 --> 11:05.165
haven't interfered
with your reading.

11:05.249 --> 11:10.420
Ah, Dostoyevsky.
The mad Russian.

11:10.504 --> 11:12.464
Good stuff. Good stuff.

11:12.548 --> 11:14.299
You're not going
to get the $26

11:14.383 --> 11:15.843
and you're despicable
for trying.

11:15.926 --> 11:18.262
What? Oh-oh, you thought...

11:18.345 --> 11:20.806
I wasn't trying
to get the $26.

11:20.889 --> 11:22.349
I thought we were
just having

11:22.432 --> 11:23.976
a perfectly innocent
conversation

11:24.059 --> 11:25.227
about literature.

11:25.310 --> 11:27.396
Oh, you're silly.
You're silly.

11:27.479 --> 11:29.565
I love that you go there.
You're silly.

11:29.940 --> 11:30.941
Good-bye.

11:32.359 --> 11:34.695
We'll take you to bulimic pie eating
in just a moment.

11:34.778 --> 11:36.738
But first, decathlon
front-runner Joe Swanson

11:36.822 --> 11:38.031
will attempt
the long jump.

11:39.408 --> 11:41.243
Come on, Joe, break a wheel.

11:41.326 --> 11:43.912
I'm ready.
Let's get it on.

11:48.292 --> 11:49.585
Ooh, a short jump.

11:49.668 --> 11:51.170
That's going to knock him
out of the lead.

11:51.253 --> 11:52.629
-Tough break.
-Tough break it is, Tom.

11:52.713 --> 11:53.881
Good contribution,
Diane.

11:53.964 --> 11:55.757
If Swanson expects
to take the gold

11:55.841 --> 11:57.384
he's going to have
to come in first

11:57.467 --> 11:59.052
in the final event,
the 100-meter dash.

11:59.136 --> 12:01.430
That's okay, Joe.
You can still win this thing.

12:01.513 --> 12:03.015
That was pathetic.

12:03.098 --> 12:06.143
Tell your wife to come
over to my place

12:06.226 --> 12:08.520
if she wants a little
boom-shaka-lacka-lacka-lacka

12:08.604 --> 12:10.731
boom-shaka-lacka-lacka-lacka

12:10.814 --> 12:13.817
boom-shaka-lacka-
lacka-lacka-boom.

12:14.693 --> 12:15.861
Peter, it's over.

12:15.944 --> 12:17.446
Over? What are
you talking about?

12:17.529 --> 12:19.448
Well, if I couldn't catch
a two-bit criminal

12:19.531 --> 12:21.366
how am I supposed
to win a race?

12:21.450 --> 12:23.702
Hey, hey, hey, what
kind of talk is that? It's un-American.

12:23.785 --> 12:25.537
( "America, the Beautiful"
plays )

12:25.621 --> 12:28.123
Did George W. Bush quit even
after losing the popular vote?

12:28.207 --> 12:29.833
No.

12:29.917 --> 12:31.710
Did he quit after losing
millions of dollars

12:31.793 --> 12:32.794
of his father's
friends' money

12:32.878 --> 12:33.879
in failed oil companies?

12:33.962 --> 12:35.130
No.

12:35.214 --> 12:36.632
Did he quit
after knocking that girl up?

12:36.715 --> 12:37.883
No.

12:37.966 --> 12:40.052
Did he quit after
he got that DUI?

12:40.135 --> 12:41.303
No.

12:41.386 --> 12:43.388
Did he quit after getting
arrested for drunk

12:43.472 --> 12:45.390
and disorderly conduct
at a football game?

12:45.474 --> 12:46.600
No. Did he quit...?

12:46.683 --> 12:47.935
I get the message, Peter.

12:52.981 --> 12:55.901
( soft pop song plays )

12:55.984 --> 13:00.072
♪♪ And I'll carry it with me,

13:00.197 --> 13:02.324

Gee, Peter, this water
tastes kind of funny.

13:14.711 --> 13:17.589
Uh, you mean, like, ha-ha,
Jerry Seinfeld funny

13:17.673 --> 13:20.717
or Elaine Boosler, God bless her,
she's trying funny?

13:20.884 --> 13:22.261
Racers, on
your mark.

13:22.344 --> 13:23.470
Go get 'em, Joe.

13:23.554 --> 13:25.472
Get set.

13:27.558 --> 13:30.352
( panting )

13:43.365 --> 13:44.658
Yeah.

13:44.741 --> 13:46.618
Joe Swanson
wins the gold medal.

13:46.702 --> 13:47.995
You did it, Joe.

13:48.078 --> 13:49.329
We did it, Peter.

13:58.297 --> 14:00.841
Mommy, look at the ladybu...
( screaming )

14:23.071 --> 14:24.948
( gasping )

14:29.745 --> 14:31.121
-Hey, Greased Lightening.
-Do I know you?

14:31.246 --> 14:32.998
Jim Kaplan, sports agent.
Do you like this car?

14:33.123 --> 14:34.124
-Yeah.
-It's yours.

14:34.208 --> 14:35.417
-Do you like my pants?
-Uh, sure.

14:35.501 --> 14:36.919
They're yours. You know
what a merkin is?

14:37.002 --> 14:38.170
No.

14:38.253 --> 14:39.671
Pubic wig, I've got one.
You want it?

14:39.755 --> 14:41.006
-No.
-Of course, you don't.

14:41.089 --> 14:42.382
You're a classy guy.
You want to be rich?

14:42.466 --> 14:43.467
-Yes.
-Sign here.

14:46.803 --> 14:48.222
What the hell?

14:51.892 --> 14:54.394
I just, I don't understand
how he could do that without me.

14:54.478 --> 14:56.188
We were going to do
everything together.

14:56.271 --> 14:57.773
It was one cereal ad, Peter.

14:57.856 --> 14:59.816
Besides, he's the one
who won the medal.

14:59.900 --> 15:01.443
Yeah, I guess.

15:01.527 --> 15:02.778
ANNOUNCER: Coming to ABC

15:02.861 --> 15:05.155
the simple story
of a man and his chair.

15:08.116 --> 15:09.243
What the hell is this?

15:09.326 --> 15:11.745
Starring Tony Danza
as Joe Swanson.

15:11.828 --> 15:13.664
Once a man at his physical peak

15:13.747 --> 15:16.667
brought down
by a cruel twist of fate.

15:19.253 --> 15:22.673
Why?

15:22.756 --> 15:24.508
With Valerie Bertinelli
as Bonnie.

15:24.675 --> 15:27.094
Joe, you've got to accept
your limitations.

15:27.177 --> 15:29.972
Why don't you just ask me
to lay down and die?

15:30.055 --> 15:31.849
I can't live like
this anymore.

15:34.351 --> 15:35.936
That's it.

15:36.019 --> 15:38.355
That's not how it happened.
It was my idea.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.357
With Bea Arthur
as Peter Griffin.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.109
You'll never make it, Joe.

15:42.192 --> 15:44.570
Why don't you
just give up right now?

15:44.653 --> 15:46.363
No, I've got to try...

15:46.446 --> 15:48.282
even if it's by myself.

15:48.365 --> 15:51.118
You're a fool,
Joe, a fool.

15:52.244 --> 15:54.496
Rolling Courage:
The Joe Swanson Story.

15:54.580 --> 15:56.498
Friday on ABC, followed by
Dharma and Greg...

15:56.582 --> 15:58.959
( whispers ): ...but you don't have
to watch that.

15:59.042 --> 16:01.128
I don't believe this.
Joe wouldn't be famous

16:01.211 --> 16:02.421
if it hadn't been for me.

16:02.504 --> 16:04.047
How come he's getting
all the glory?

16:04.131 --> 16:05.549
He's handicapped.
That's what makes

16:05.632 --> 16:06.884
his story so
inspirational.

16:06.967 --> 16:08.343
Handicapped...

16:08.427 --> 16:09.845
Hmm...

16:09.928 --> 16:13.056
Ah, how did these get up here?

16:17.561 --> 16:19.271
What the hell
is this, Brian?

16:19.354 --> 16:21.899
It's my new passport. What are you doing
going through my mail?

16:22.107 --> 16:24.151
You weren't planning
on going somewhere

16:24.234 --> 16:25.736
with our $26,
were you?

16:25.819 --> 16:27.779
Oh, for God's sake, I just had
the damn thing renewed.

16:27.863 --> 16:29.031
What's the matter with you?

16:29.114 --> 16:30.490
Look here, you're obviously

16:30.574 --> 16:32.159
taking us for saps,
but we're not.

16:32.242 --> 16:35.245
Now fess up, or I'll do to you
what I did to John Lennon.

16:35.329 --> 16:37.331
John, have you met Yoko?
Yoko, John.

16:37.414 --> 16:38.957
You want your money, fine.

16:39.082 --> 16:41.001
I hope you all kill
each other.

16:42.753 --> 16:44.796
All right, I know
how to settle this.

16:44.880 --> 16:47.174
Whoever wants the money...
raise your hand.

16:47.257 --> 16:49.384
Oh, you're smarter
than I thought.

16:49.468 --> 16:51.553
Give yourselves
a round of applause.

16:51.637 --> 16:52.763
Damn!

16:54.932 --> 16:56.934
Yeah, honey, I'm going
to be a little late tonight.

16:57.017 --> 16:58.435
I've got a hooker
coming over.

16:58.560 --> 16:59.978
Well, I know it's late notice.

17:00.062 --> 17:01.647
But what about the pool guy?
He likes you.

17:01.813 --> 17:03.398
Mr. Tucker, Mr. Griffin's
here to see you.

17:03.482 --> 17:04.650
I got to go.

17:04.733 --> 17:06.693
Mr. Tucker, I have just
become handicapped

17:06.777 --> 17:08.487
like Joe Swanson,
and I demand

17:08.570 --> 17:10.572
commercial endorsements
and a TV movie

17:10.656 --> 17:12.824
based on me starring
Valerie Bert-and-Ernie.

17:12.991 --> 17:14.409
But Mr. Griffin...

17:14.493 --> 17:17.079
I even got the first piece
you're going to run:

17:17.162 --> 17:20.165
exclusive video footage
of my tragic accident.

17:20.249 --> 17:23.085
Oh, no, a car going too fast
to stop in time.

17:23.168 --> 17:24.837
( screaming )

17:27.130 --> 17:32.469
( wailing ):
I'm handicapped now.

17:32.553 --> 17:35.097
Mr. Griffin, you can't possibly expect me
to believe this.

17:35.180 --> 17:37.474
That was clearly a scarecrow dressed
in your clothes.

17:37.558 --> 17:38.725
Oh, come on.

17:38.809 --> 17:40.102
And when I
freeze-frame...

17:41.311 --> 17:43.313
that's you
driving the car.

17:43.397 --> 17:45.023
-Well there's your hook.
-Get out.

17:47.067 --> 17:49.236
Today we're here
to honor Joe Swanson

17:49.361 --> 17:51.947
for pulling my poor
one-eyed cat, Bootsie

17:52.030 --> 17:55.200
out of the old stovepipe of my
grandmother's cabin.

17:55.284 --> 17:58.245
Joe Swanson won the Special
People's Decathlon

17:58.328 --> 18:00.247
and we're here
to honor him.

18:00.330 --> 18:01.331
( cheering )

18:01.415 --> 18:02.666
Backstabber.

18:02.749 --> 18:05.043
Oh, Peter, I'm sure Joe's going
to acknowledge you, you'll see.

18:05.169 --> 18:06.461
Just don't forget
our deal, Lois.

18:06.545 --> 18:09.173
I sit through this, and
later tonight, I get anal.

18:09.256 --> 18:10.257
You hear me?

18:10.340 --> 18:12.301
No matter how neat
I want the house, you have to clean it.

18:12.467 --> 18:14.052
Thank you, thank you.

18:14.136 --> 18:17.014
You know, no one could win
a gold medal by himself.

18:17.181 --> 18:19.558
It takes friends,
and I want to acknowledge

18:19.641 --> 18:21.518
a special friend
in the audience today.

18:21.602 --> 18:23.812
My friend, Peter.

18:23.896 --> 18:26.023
Peter Yarrow,
of Peter, Paul and Mary.

18:26.148 --> 18:27.774
Let's give him a hand, folks.

18:30.444 --> 18:32.988
But that's nothing compared
to what this next man did.

18:33.071 --> 18:35.282
He challenged me
to go that extra mile.

18:35.616 --> 18:37.159
And that man is Mr. Griffin.

18:37.910 --> 18:39.786
Comedian Eddie Griffin,
get up here.

18:42.706 --> 18:45.584
Your acerbic, anti-white humor
was a constant inspiration.

18:45.792 --> 18:47.336
Thank you, sir.

18:47.419 --> 18:51.340
And last, but not least,
who could forget the fat guy?

18:51.423 --> 18:55.010
Chef Paul Prudhomme,
you get your Cajun ass up here.

18:55.093 --> 18:57.012
Wow, I didn't even do anything.

18:57.095 --> 18:59.681
That's it. Excuse me,
but there's someone else

18:59.765 --> 19:01.308
he didn't thank:

19:01.391 --> 19:03.101
Mr. Steroid.
That's how he won.

19:03.185 --> 19:04.228
That's not true.

19:04.311 --> 19:05.938
Yes, it is.
I put steroids

19:06.021 --> 19:08.148
in your water bottle
right before the last race.

19:08.273 --> 19:10.275
( booing )

19:10.359 --> 19:13.237
I'm sorry, everybody.
I've let you all down.

19:13.320 --> 19:14.613
Yes.

19:14.696 --> 19:16.323
You suck. I rule.

19:16.490 --> 19:17.533
Who da man?

19:17.616 --> 19:18.825
Who da man?

19:18.909 --> 19:19.910
Who da man?

19:22.913 --> 19:25.582
All right, if anyone
tries to lift the glass

19:25.666 --> 19:27.000
the bell will ring.

19:27.167 --> 19:29.253
Well, then, let's
all go to bed.

19:29.336 --> 19:31.004
Off we go, then.

19:47.855 --> 19:49.898
( grunts and groans )

19:55.904 --> 19:58.031
( grunts and groans )

20:01.827 --> 20:03.328
( doorbell rings )

20:03.412 --> 20:05.247
Did you find
the place okay?

20:05.372 --> 20:06.373
No problem.

20:06.456 --> 20:07.916
Hey, kids?

20:08.000 --> 20:10.210
( yawning ): I only had soup.
I don't see why

20:10.294 --> 20:12.421
we should split the bill evenly.

20:12.504 --> 20:13.881
Wake up.
This is Mr. Taylor.

20:13.964 --> 20:15.716
He's here to claim
the money clip.

20:15.799 --> 20:16.800
Oh.

20:16.884 --> 20:17.885
Oh.

20:17.968 --> 20:19.678
Ugh!

20:23.182 --> 20:25.058
Peter, you should
go talk the him.

20:25.142 --> 20:27.019
After all, you set out
to make him feel better

20:27.102 --> 20:28.520
and now he's worse
than ever.

20:28.604 --> 20:29.813
Yeah, I don't know, Lois.

20:29.897 --> 20:31.815
He's probably
over there waiting

20:31.899 --> 20:33.775
to be interviewed
by Dan Rather

20:33.859 --> 20:35.611
or that dreadful
Gene Shalit.

20:35.694 --> 20:38.697
Oh, I think those days
are over now, Peter.

20:41.200 --> 20:42.743
Uh, hey, there.

20:42.826 --> 20:45.120
Uh... hi, Peter.

20:45.204 --> 20:47.206
Listen, Joe, about
this whole mess...

20:47.289 --> 20:48.415
Hold it, Peter.

20:52.085 --> 20:53.587
That's the car wash thief.

21:05.682 --> 21:07.684
Ha, ha, tough luck, wheelie.

21:07.893 --> 21:09.144
Yeah, for you.

21:11.522 --> 21:13.190
I'm Joe, your waiter.

21:13.273 --> 21:17.319
Today's special is justice,
served cold with a side of jail.

21:17.402 --> 21:21.406
And order the soufflé now,
'cause it takes ten to 15 years.

21:24.743 --> 21:27.538
Hey, Peter, I really appreciate
what you did for me.

21:27.663 --> 21:28.914
What do you mean?

21:28.997 --> 21:31.124
Well, that slimy agent
had me believing the hype.

21:31.208 --> 21:32.960
And I forgot
it was really you

21:33.043 --> 21:35.087
who got me to believe
in myself again.

21:35.170 --> 21:37.422
Oh, and by the way,
I'm going back to the force.

21:37.506 --> 21:39.591
Good for you.

21:39.675 --> 21:41.885
Say, what happened
to the car wash thief?

21:41.969 --> 21:45.180
Ironically, I severed his
spine when I landed on him.

21:45.264 --> 21:47.224
Well, looks like
you've got more competition

21:47.391 --> 21:48.475
at next year's
games, huh?

21:48.559 --> 21:49.977
Nope, he's dead.
