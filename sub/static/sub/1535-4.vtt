WEBVTT

00:02.528 --> 00:04.494
Have you guys heard
about this research team

00:04.496 --> 00:07.697
that's trying to transgenically
manipulate chicken DNA

00:07.699 --> 00:10.033
to create some sort
of chicken dinosaur?

00:10.035 --> 00:13.036
Oh, I think that
sounds wonderful.

00:14.373 --> 00:18.041
What? You're afraid
of both dinosaurs and chickens.

00:18.043 --> 00:19.043
Yes, but tell me

00:19.044 --> 00:21.244
a dinosaur
chicken salad sandwich

00:21.246 --> 00:22.946
wouldn't hit the Mesozoic spot.

00:26.385 --> 00:27.651
Hey, guys.
Hey. Hello.

00:27.653 --> 00:29.186
We still on for
tomorrow night?

00:29.188 --> 00:31.254
Yeah. I'm excited
to finally meet your girlfriend.

00:31.256 --> 00:33.390
Yeah, oh, and
speaking of which.

00:33.392 --> 00:36.159
According to a recent study
out of Oxford University,

00:36.161 --> 00:37.427
when someone takes on

00:37.429 --> 00:39.262
a new romantic
partner,

00:39.264 --> 00:42.132
that person loses one
or two close friends.

00:42.134 --> 00:44.901
Since when do you read
social science?

00:44.903 --> 00:47.871
I go to the bathroom
like everybody else.

00:47.873 --> 00:49.239
Why would I lose friends

00:49.241 --> 00:51.141
just because I
started dating someone?

00:51.143 --> 00:53.176
Yeah, you didn't lose anyone
when you met Amy.

00:53.178 --> 00:56.379
Yeah, well, no, the study
refers to <i> romantic</i> partners.

00:56.381 --> 00:59.616
Not the way I would
categorize the two of us.

00:59.618 --> 01:01.218
You guys kiss and hold hands.

01:01.220 --> 01:03.653
I've seen him do it.
It's not romantic.

01:03.655 --> 01:05.855
Look, I'm not the kind of guy

01:05.857 --> 01:08.658
who drops his friends just
because he's in a relationship.

01:08.660 --> 01:10.327
What happens
if she doesn't like us?

01:10.329 --> 01:11.695
Well, hey,
you're my dear friends.

01:11.697 --> 01:14.064
You'll get a Christmas card
for a couple of years,

01:14.066 --> 01:15.632
and then you're dead to me.

01:46.768 --> 01:50.036
So, Howard, is Stuart still
living with your mom?

01:50.038 --> 01:51.837
I don't want
to talk about it.

01:51.839 --> 01:54.240
But he's going to.
My mom got him cable!

01:54.242 --> 01:56.375
In my whole life,

01:56.377 --> 01:58.144
growing up
in that house-- no cable.

01:58.146 --> 01:59.579
Do you know how many HBOs

01:59.581 --> 02:01.581
that leech had my mother
get him? Seven.

02:01.583 --> 02:03.916
Seven HBOs. Seven!

02:03.918 --> 02:07.663
Long story short,
they have seven HBOs.

02:07.665 --> 02:08.964
Hey, guys.

02:08.966 --> 02:10.866
Hey.
Hello. Hey.

02:10.868 --> 02:12.901
Emily, you know almost everybody here.
Hi.

02:12.903 --> 02:14.703
This is Leonard,
this is Penny.

02:14.705 --> 02:16.038
Oh, it's so nice
to meet you.

02:16.040 --> 02:17.773
Nice to finally meet you, too.
Hi.

02:17.775 --> 02:18.907
Hello.

02:18.909 --> 02:21.376
Well, Raj,
you were not lying about her.

02:21.378 --> 02:24.179
I told you
she exists.

02:24.181 --> 02:26.214
Hey, I hear you're
a dermatologist.

02:26.216 --> 02:29.217
Uh, yeah, I'm a resident
at Huntington Hospital.

02:29.219 --> 02:31.753
Oh, I like their
emergency room.

02:31.755 --> 02:34.623
Yeah, even if it turns out
you don't have Dengue fever,

02:34.625 --> 02:37.025
they still let you
take a lollipop.

02:38.095 --> 02:39.761
You know, Penny
just started training

02:39.763 --> 02:41.496
to be a pharmaceutical
sales rep.

02:41.498 --> 02:43.665
Maybe she can practice
on you some time.

02:43.667 --> 02:46.368
Oh, it would be great
to practice on a real doctor.

02:46.370 --> 02:48.537
Yeah. I'm sure that'd be fine.

02:48.539 --> 02:52.240
I have some odd
freckles on my buttocks.

02:54.044 --> 02:57.713
Can I make an appointment
for you to look at them?

02:57.715 --> 03:00.182
Um... okay, I guess.

03:00.184 --> 03:03.018
I'm with him three
years, nothing.

03:03.020 --> 03:06.421
She's with two minutes, and
he's taking his pants off.

03:10.894 --> 03:13.495
Last night was fun.
What did you think of Emily?

03:13.497 --> 03:14.830
I don't know.

03:14.832 --> 03:16.999
I kind of got the sense
she didn't like me.

03:17.001 --> 03:18.767
Did she <i> say</i> she didn't like you?

03:18.769 --> 03:19.901
Of course not. No one ever says

03:19.903 --> 03:21.436
they don't like you
straight to your face.

03:21.438 --> 03:25.307
We have led different lives.

03:26.710 --> 03:29.544
You guys just met.
Why would she feel that way?

03:29.546 --> 03:31.013
It's just this
vibe I got.

03:31.015 --> 03:32.995
I'm sure you're worried
about nothing.

03:32.996 --> 03:34.416
Yeah.
You're probably right.

03:34.418 --> 03:35.784
I used to think
my high school P.E. teacher

03:35.786 --> 03:37.019
didn't like me,
but it turned out,

03:37.021 --> 03:39.187
she liked me a little too much.

03:39.189 --> 03:40.455
Really?
Yeah.

03:40.457 --> 03:41.690
It was fine.

03:41.692 --> 03:43.558
We went to a Melissa Etheridge
concert, I got an A,

03:43.560 --> 03:45.227
it all worked out.

03:45.229 --> 03:48.563
When you go to Emily's office to
practice, you'll see. It's fine.

03:48.565 --> 03:50.265
Yeah, I hope you're right.

03:50.267 --> 03:52.234
You really went your entire life

03:52.236 --> 03:55.871
without anyone saying
“I hate you” to your face?

03:55.873 --> 03:57.439
Yeah.

03:57.441 --> 04:01.443
I'd say it now,
but look at those cheekbones.

04:08.185 --> 04:10.185
I miss
Stuart's place.

04:10.187 --> 04:13.855
All this loud music
and exposed brick.

04:13.857 --> 04:16.124
What, is this
a comic book store,

04:16.125 --> 04:19.628
or a rave at the third
little pig's house?

04:20.697 --> 04:22.898
Yup, I wish
Stuart would reopen.

04:22.900 --> 04:24.900
I hate this place, too.

04:24.902 --> 04:26.702
Okay, him I believe

04:26.704 --> 04:29.871
because he's an 80-year-old man
in a 15-year-old's T-shirt.

04:29.873 --> 04:31.640
But you're just upset

04:31.642 --> 04:35.043
about Stuart and your mom
and all their HBOs.

04:35.045 --> 04:38.547
Yes, I am. You know, I can't
even watch <i> Game of Thrones</i> now

04:38.549 --> 04:40.215
without thinking
of mother saying,

04:40.217 --> 04:43.385
“Stuart, which one is Thrones?”

04:44.221 --> 04:46.221
You know, he might not reopen.

04:46.223 --> 04:49.057
He didn't get a lot of money
from the insurance company.

04:49.059 --> 04:51.717
Oh, boy, if there is one thing
that gets my goat,

04:51.719 --> 04:55.020
those dad-gum
insurance companies.

04:55.022 --> 04:57.623
Why? Because they won't
get off your lawn?

05:00.828 --> 05:05.564
Oh, is Stuart trying to get a
loan, or-or find investors?

05:05.566 --> 05:07.599
All I know is,
he's got my mother

05:07.601 --> 05:10.669
buying four-ply toilet paper.
I mean, four-ply.

05:11.705 --> 05:13.105
If his butt is so delicate,

05:13.107 --> 05:15.474
why doesn't he just use
an angora rabbit?

05:16.477 --> 05:19.544
For starters,
they shed and bite.

05:20.347 --> 05:22.180
Hey,

05:22.182 --> 05:23.649
here's a thought.

05:23.651 --> 05:26.151
Why don't we put up the rest
of the money that Stuart needs?

05:27.221 --> 05:30.789
So, we'd be, like, owners
of a comic book store?

05:32.359 --> 05:34.192
It's kind of a
dream come true.

05:34.194 --> 05:35.694
That does sound fun.

05:35.696 --> 05:37.229
Ooh, maybe we could come up

05:37.231 --> 05:39.731
with a business plan
to compete with this place.

05:39.733 --> 05:41.600
I'll give you a plan right now.

05:41.602 --> 05:44.102
Step one:
open comic book store.

05:44.104 --> 05:45.570
Step two: start rumor

05:45.572 --> 05:48.874
this comic book store
gives you genital warts.

05:50.511 --> 05:54.680
Step three: buy a big bag
to put the money in.

05:56.850 --> 05:59.051
It's not that bad.

06:03.123 --> 06:06.425
Hey.
Hi.

06:06.427 --> 06:09.299
Thank you so much for letting me
practice my sales pitch on you.

06:09.300 --> 06:10.300
I really appreciate it.

06:10.308 --> 06:11.121
Sure.

06:11.145 --> 06:12.273
Um, I brought coffee.

06:12.274 --> 06:13.807
I wasn't sure what you like,
so I got

06:13.809 --> 06:16.043
a regular, a cappuccino
and a Chai tea.

06:16.045 --> 06:19.179
Since you like Raj, I thought
you might be into that.

06:19.181 --> 06:22.482
Thanks. If we could get started.
I'm a little busy.

06:22.484 --> 06:25.252
Oh, yeah, sure. Let me
just get out my materials.

06:25.254 --> 06:26.753
Leonard gave me this briefcase.

06:26.755 --> 06:28.422
He used to carry it
around in high school.

06:28.424 --> 06:31.758
You can still see the dent
where they whacked him with it.

06:33.929 --> 06:36.029
Okay, I would like
to talk to you

06:36.031 --> 06:38.298
about our new
birth control pill, Femevra.

06:38.300 --> 06:39.633
Great.

06:39.635 --> 06:41.668
So, Femevra's
triphasic design

06:41.670 --> 06:43.804
provides balanced
hormonal exposure.

06:43.806 --> 06:45.639
All right.

06:45.641 --> 06:48.408
It has also been shown to cause

06:48.410 --> 06:51.445
significantly fewer side effects
than other oral contraceptives.

06:51.447 --> 06:54.314
Although it can cause acne,
which, if you ask me, kind of

06:54.316 --> 06:57.084
increases its effectiveness
as a contraceptive.

07:00.990 --> 07:02.656
Funny.

07:04.159 --> 07:06.960
Okay, I'm sorry. Did we get off
on the wrong foot?

07:06.962 --> 07:08.829
Because since the other
night, I kind of feel like

07:08.831 --> 07:10.364
you might have a problem
with me.

07:10.366 --> 07:11.732
No, it's fine.

07:11.734 --> 07:14.301
Are you sure,
because it doesn't seem fine?

07:14.303 --> 07:16.536
Okay.

07:16.538 --> 07:18.338
If you really want
to talk about this,

07:18.340 --> 07:19.640
I do have a problem.

07:19.642 --> 07:21.908
Oh, my God.
Tell me-- what did I do?

07:21.910 --> 07:23.276
Look, it's nothing. It's just...

07:23.278 --> 07:25.912
Raj told me that a while ago,
you two hooked up.

07:25.914 --> 07:30.183
What?! Oh, why
would he say that?

07:30.185 --> 07:31.685
Did it not happen?

07:31.687 --> 07:34.454
Well, I wouldn't exactly
call it a hook-up.

07:34.456 --> 07:35.555
Did you kiss?

07:35.557 --> 07:37.524
Yeah.

07:37.526 --> 07:38.526
Were you naked?

07:38.527 --> 07:40.927
Yeah.

07:40.929 --> 07:42.729
So, it <i> was</i> a hook-up.

07:42.731 --> 07:44.698
No.

07:44.700 --> 07:46.900
Yeah.

07:49.004 --> 07:52.673
So, what are some ways we
could set our comic book store

07:52.675 --> 07:54.341
apart from the
competition?

07:54.343 --> 07:56.076
Oh, kids buy comic books.
It would be great

07:56.078 --> 07:58.178
to figure out a way
to get more kids in the store.

07:58.180 --> 08:00.180
You know, when I was a
kid, I loved going there,

08:00.182 --> 08:02.182
but I could
never get a ride.

08:02.184 --> 08:06.186
Ooh, what if we got a van and
drove around and picked kids up?

08:10.359 --> 08:12.392
Nice.

08:13.595 --> 08:16.830
You mean,
like at parks and schools?

08:17.499 --> 08:20.367
Toy stores,
puppet shows.

08:20.369 --> 08:24.504
Hold on. So, your idea is
to get a van

08:24.506 --> 08:27.941
and cruise the streets looking
for kids to pick up?

08:29.478 --> 08:31.845
Yes.

08:32.981 --> 08:36.717
And are you gonna use candy
to lure them in?

08:37.586 --> 08:40.120
We are now!

08:42.124 --> 08:44.391
You told Emily
we hooked up?!

08:44.393 --> 08:47.761
Um, well, in my defense,
I tell everybody.

08:47.763 --> 08:49.162
Why would you say that?!

08:49.164 --> 08:51.465
We were having a conversation
about past lovers.

08:51.467 --> 08:52.599
We weren't lovers! Come on.

08:52.601 --> 08:53.867
Everyone knows
we didn't sleep together.

08:53.869 --> 08:55.168
We got drunk
and fooled around.

08:55.170 --> 08:56.937
Why couldn't you just
leave me out of it?

08:56.939 --> 08:58.071
Well, we were being honest.

08:58.073 --> 08:59.840
You would leave me
out of the conversation

08:59.842 --> 09:01.708
with the next guy
if you dump Leonard?

09:01.710 --> 09:04.878
Why say it?
Yes!

09:04.880 --> 09:07.247
Well, I would never
leave you off my list,

09:07.249 --> 09:08.882
and not just

09:08.884 --> 09:10.183
because, without you,

09:10.185 --> 09:12.619
we're playing fast and loose
with the word “list.”

09:12.621 --> 09:14.654
Well, good job.
Now she hates me.

09:14.656 --> 09:16.823
Oh.

09:16.825 --> 09:19.092
Great.

09:19.094 --> 09:21.595
On the bright side,
that Oxford study was right.

09:21.597 --> 09:23.663
One friend down.

09:24.867 --> 09:28.935
I wonder who you're going
to lose next.

09:28.937 --> 09:31.338
You, okay? It's you.
You're-you're next!

09:33.208 --> 09:36.109
No. You're crazy about me.

09:40.581 --> 09:42.682
I feel pretty....oh so pretty.

09:44.810 --> 09:47.044
I don't know what Emily's
so upset about anyway.

09:47.046 --> 09:49.980
Even if I had slept with him,
so what? Everyone has a past.

09:50.783 --> 09:53.450
Almost everyone has a past.

09:53.452 --> 09:54.885
Come on, look
how pretty you are.

09:54.887 --> 09:56.987
I'm sure this isn't
the first girl to hate you.

09:56.989 --> 09:59.590
It's not.

09:59.592 --> 10:02.226
And I'm sure
you can turn it around.

10:02.228 --> 10:04.528
How? You can't force someone
to like you.

10:04.530 --> 10:05.596
What if you just

10:05.598 --> 10:07.264
hang around and act
like her friend

10:07.266 --> 10:09.833
until you wear her down?
I mean, next thing you know,

10:09.835 --> 10:11.190
you're in her home,
you're eating her food,

10:11.214 --> 10:12.285
drinking her wine.

10:15.208 --> 10:16.807
No, that won't work.

10:16.809 --> 10:19.143
You're right. Cheers.

10:19.145 --> 10:20.411
Oh, I know.

10:20.413 --> 10:22.379
Why don't you use
your sales training

10:22.381 --> 10:24.615
to go back down there
and sell <i> yourself?</i>

10:24.617 --> 10:26.016
What?
Yeah.

10:26.018 --> 10:27.585
But instead of selling a drug,

10:27.587 --> 10:29.386
you'd be selling Penny--
it's cute.

10:29.388 --> 10:30.421
It's stupid.

10:30.423 --> 10:32.623
Well, maybe people
would like you more

10:32.625 --> 10:35.392
if you didn't crap
all over their ideas.

10:35.394 --> 10:37.995
I'm gonna go with
Penny on this one.

10:37.997 --> 10:41.632
Then again, why wouldn't I?
I mean, we go way back.

10:41.634 --> 10:44.668
Oh, my God.
I didn't used to like you.

10:44.670 --> 10:47.871
Shh. Amy's here now.

10:50.710 --> 10:53.210
You know, the more
I think about it,

10:53.212 --> 10:56.847
the more intrigued I am
about having our own store.

10:56.849 --> 10:58.849
We'll get to see
all the new stuff

10:58.851 --> 11:00.484
before it hits the shelves.

11:00.486 --> 11:02.386
And we'll get to have
fun interactions

11:02.388 --> 11:03.554
with our customers.

11:03.556 --> 11:07.191
“This isn't a library--
buy it or get out.”

11:07.193 --> 11:10.160
You say things like that
all the time.

11:10.162 --> 11:12.429
Yes, but as a store owner,
I'll finally have a good comeback

11:12.431 --> 11:14.898
to, “You don't work here--
shut up.”

11:16.235 --> 11:18.569
Uh, do you know how Penny
told Raj he should have

11:18.571 --> 11:20.404
left her off his list?
Yeah.

11:20.406 --> 11:22.906
Well, do you think when she
and I had that conversation,

11:22.908 --> 11:24.408
she left people off <i> her</i> list?

11:24.410 --> 11:25.743
I'm sure she did.

11:25.745 --> 11:27.778
Why?

11:27.780 --> 11:29.513
Because if she hadn't,

11:29.515 --> 11:33.217
she'd still be wading
through the list.

11:33.219 --> 11:34.918
Will you stay out of this?

11:34.920 --> 11:37.588
If only Penny
had said that once in a while.

11:39.692 --> 11:41.191
Hey, what difference
does it make?

11:41.193 --> 11:43.027
You're the one
she wants to marry.

11:43.029 --> 11:44.762
That's true.
Yeah, and I'm not sure

11:44.764 --> 11:47.731
that complete honesty
is always the best thing

11:47.733 --> 11:49.566
for a relationship.

11:49.568 --> 11:52.603
Yeah, he's right.
Once, in a moment of candor,

11:52.605 --> 11:55.439
I told Amy
that her hair reminded me

11:55.441 --> 11:58.609
of a duck caught
in an oil spill. Well...

11:58.611 --> 12:00.477
she stormed out.

12:00.479 --> 12:03.147
Which was sad, because
we were playing Scrabble,

12:03.149 --> 12:07.551
and I had all the letters
to spell “persimmon.”

12:10.690 --> 12:13.057
Why are you even part
of this conversation?

12:13.059 --> 12:14.925
You don't know
anything about women.

12:14.927 --> 12:17.628
I know that if I had
a wife or a fiancée,

12:17.630 --> 12:19.697
I'd ask her first
before I invested money

12:19.699 --> 12:21.532
in a comic book store.

12:21.534 --> 12:23.267
He's right.

12:23.269 --> 12:24.335
Yeah, well,

12:24.337 --> 12:25.602
of course I am.

12:25.604 --> 12:27.037
I was also right about her hair.

12:27.039 --> 12:29.106
It did everything but quack.

12:32.278 --> 12:34.511
There's something
I wanted to run past you.

12:34.513 --> 12:36.680
What's up?
Mm, the guys and I

12:36.682 --> 12:39.450
were thinking about investing
in Stuart's comic book store.

12:39.452 --> 12:41.985
Is that okay?
Why are you asking me?

12:41.987 --> 12:43.821
Well, you know,
we're engaged,

12:43.823 --> 12:46.323
and it's kind of
a big deal financially.

12:46.325 --> 12:48.625
It seems like something
we should talk about.

12:48.627 --> 12:49.893
Oh.

12:49.895 --> 12:52.329
Well, would you consider
mounds of credit card debt

12:52.331 --> 12:54.865
kind of a big deal
financially?

12:56.836 --> 12:58.869
Yeah.

12:58.871 --> 13:00.471
Huh.

13:02.641 --> 13:05.743
Mm. So, me and the guys
were talking about

13:05.745 --> 13:07.711
this great
investment opportunity...

13:07.713 --> 13:09.713
Nope.

13:09.715 --> 13:12.449
But you didn't hear what it was.

13:12.451 --> 13:15.219
I know.

13:16.088 --> 13:17.988
Oh, come on.

13:17.990 --> 13:19.456
Fine. What is it?

13:19.458 --> 13:21.558
It's to help reopen
the comic book store.

13:21.560 --> 13:23.327
Nope.

13:23.329 --> 13:25.429
Well, hear me out.

13:25.431 --> 13:27.631
Howard, you know
we're saving up for a house.

13:27.633 --> 13:29.967
I know, but all the guys
are doing it.

13:29.969 --> 13:32.870
We're splitting it four ways, so
it's really not that much money.

13:32.872 --> 13:35.639
It just seems
like a risky investment.

13:35.641 --> 13:38.342
I get that. I...

13:39.245 --> 13:41.845
Okay, look...

13:43.382 --> 13:48.218
The reason this is important
is...

13:49.321 --> 13:52.956
...before my dad left
me and my mom...

13:52.958 --> 13:56.660
he used to... take me
to the comic book store.

13:57.596 --> 14:01.098
It was one of the few things
we did together.

14:01.100 --> 14:03.867
Oh. Howie, I had no idea.

14:03.869 --> 14:07.271
Well, I don't...
like to talk about it.

14:07.273 --> 14:09.973
Oh, baby.

14:09.975 --> 14:13.444
That story's made
up, isn't it?

14:14.647 --> 14:18.215
That's how much buying
a comic book store means to me.

14:21.187 --> 14:23.887
I'd like your honest
opinion on something.

14:23.889 --> 14:25.122
Of course.

14:25.124 --> 14:26.590
Now, before I start,

14:26.592 --> 14:30.594
I need you to know that
I'm very excited about this,

14:30.596 --> 14:32.696
and anything you say

14:32.698 --> 14:34.765
that isn't
enthusiastically supportive

14:34.767 --> 14:38.469
will throw our entire
relationship into question.

14:40.606 --> 14:42.306
So...

14:42.308 --> 14:45.075
keep an open mind.

14:45.077 --> 14:48.178
I'm feeling a little backed
into a corner, Sheldon.

14:48.180 --> 14:50.214
Perfect. Now...

14:51.484 --> 14:53.951
...I'm considering investing

14:53.953 --> 14:56.653
in Stuart's comic book store.

14:57.523 --> 14:58.989
Interesting.

15:01.093 --> 15:03.827
Can you see how
a grown man,

15:03.829 --> 15:05.429
an accomplished scientist,

15:05.431 --> 15:07.965
who invests in a store

15:07.967 --> 15:09.833
that sells picture books

15:09.835 --> 15:13.237
about flying men in
colorful underwear...

15:14.507 --> 15:16.673
...might be wasting
both his financial

15:16.675 --> 15:18.742
and intellectual
resources?

15:25.384 --> 15:27.584
No.

15:29.121 --> 15:31.755
Then I think it's
a terrific idea.

15:31.757 --> 15:33.624
Great.

15:33.626 --> 15:37.761
Wait till you hear
about our van.

15:42.067 --> 15:44.001
Hey. Thanks for inviting us over.
Hey.

15:44.003 --> 15:45.435
Oh, thank you
for coming.

15:45.437 --> 15:47.971
Uh, listen, Penny,
before you start,

15:47.973 --> 15:49.940
I just want to apologize
for being so rude

15:49.942 --> 15:51.275
the other day
in my office.

15:51.277 --> 15:52.743
No, no. No need to apologize.

15:52.745 --> 15:54.444
Excuse me,
can I say something?

15:54.446 --> 15:56.580
I just love both you guys,

15:56.582 --> 15:58.549
and I want you
to get along.

15:58.551 --> 16:01.151
And when I say “love”"
I meant as a friend.

16:02.121 --> 16:04.888
And, uh, way
too soon, right?

16:06.225 --> 16:07.891
Okay, sit down.
Listen, Emily,

16:07.893 --> 16:09.459
what happened
between me and Raj

16:09.461 --> 16:10.961
was a long time ago.
It was,

16:10.963 --> 16:12.329
and I may have
made it seem

16:12.331 --> 16:14.031
like a bigger deal
than I should have.

16:14.033 --> 16:15.499
Yeah, and Leonard and I
are engaged now,

16:15.501 --> 16:17.901
and I'm just hoping we can put
this whole thing behind us.

16:17.903 --> 16:19.369
Mm. I'd like that, too.

16:19.371 --> 16:21.538
Yeah, I thought
I'd be okay with it,

16:21.540 --> 16:23.774
but then I saw
how pretty you are.

16:23.776 --> 16:25.309
Oh, that's so sweet.

16:25.311 --> 16:27.444
I mean, look at you--
you are gorgeous.

16:27.446 --> 16:31.181
It's true--
you're both gorgeous.

16:31.183 --> 16:33.884
Kind of says something about
the man who could bed you both.

16:40.326 --> 16:44.661
You get why I've been alone
most of my adult life.

16:47.333 --> 16:50.067
So, what brings you by?
Well,

16:50.069 --> 16:52.836
I don't need a reason--
it's my house.

16:52.838 --> 16:55.172
Technically,
it's your mom's house, but...

16:55.174 --> 16:58.175
we certainly want you
to feel welcome.

16:58.177 --> 17:00.944
I'm always welcome.

17:00.946 --> 17:03.714
Mm, just... try and call first.

17:03.716 --> 17:06.983
Okay, let's get
down to business.

17:06.986 --> 17:09.353
Howie was thinking about
putting up some money

17:09.355 --> 17:12.321
to help you reopen the store,
but before that happens,

17:12.324 --> 17:14.391
I have a few questions.
Oh.

17:14.393 --> 17:15.759
I appreciate the offer,

17:15.761 --> 17:18.895
but actually your mother
already gave me the money.

17:20.566 --> 17:22.866
What?

17:22.867 --> 17:25.002
Yeah. I told her
it was too much,

17:25.003 --> 17:28.171
but she said she was happy
to help out her <i> bubala.</i>

17:29.441 --> 17:31.708
Excuse me.

17:32.678 --> 17:35.012
Ma, you are canceling
that check,

17:35.014 --> 17:37.781
and Stuart is not your <i> bubala;</i>
I'm your <i> bubala.</i>

17:37.783 --> 17:41.051
You can't have more
than one <i> bubala!</i>

17:41.053 --> 17:42.786
I don't know
who he's talking to.

17:42.788 --> 17:45.255
She's at Target,
buying me shirts.

17:48.293 --> 17:50.794
I'm so glad we
could work this all out.

17:50.796 --> 17:53.430
Yeah, me, too.
You know, we should have dinner

17:53.432 --> 17:54.798
one night with you and Leonard.

17:54.800 --> 17:55.999
Oh, we would love that.

17:56.001 --> 17:56.733
Great!

17:57.970 --> 18:00.037
Okay, good night, guys.
All right, night.

18:00.039 --> 18:02.039
Bye.

18:02.041 --> 18:04.608
I hate her.
I hate her.

18:13.540 --> 18:15.106
I'm really disappointed
we're not gonna have

18:15.108 --> 18:16.808
our own comic book store.
I know.

18:16.810 --> 18:18.576
I was looking forward to it.
It would've been

18:18.578 --> 18:20.878
so nice to have a place
that was ours,

18:20.880 --> 18:23.848
where we could just sit
and read comics in peace.

18:23.850 --> 18:25.316
With comfy seats.

18:25.318 --> 18:26.684
And snacks.

18:26.686 --> 18:28.786
Well, I guess
it was too good to be true.

18:28.788 --> 18:30.321
