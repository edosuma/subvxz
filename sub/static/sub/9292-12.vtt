00:15.329 --> 00:17.867
( crying )

00:17.934 --> 00:18.869
Your wife survived the attack.

00:18.935 --> 00:20.504
Thank God.

00:20.571 --> 00:22.207
LOGAN:
I should never have given in.

00:22.275 --> 00:23.611
I should have ordered back
the motorcade.

00:23.677 --> 00:25.547
The terrorist attack failed.

00:25.615 --> 00:26.950
We have to assume

00:27.017 --> 00:28.687
they'll make good
on their threat to use

00:28.754 --> 00:30.992
the Sentox nerve gas
on American soil.

00:31.057 --> 00:32.527
Listen, I-I made
a mistake.

00:32.594 --> 00:35.198
I didn't think that
I had any choice.

00:35.266 --> 00:37.770
MARTHA:
You didn't stand up to them.

00:37.838 --> 00:39.172
You saved my life.

00:39.240 --> 00:40.743
You're welcome.

00:40.810 --> 00:42.178
Country's lucky

00:42.245 --> 00:43.381
to have men like you.

00:43.448 --> 00:45.351
I'm lucky.

00:45.418 --> 00:48.858
Mrs. Logan?

00:48.926 --> 00:50.828
Christopher Henderson
was responsible for setting up

00:50.896 --> 00:52.231
the deal that allowed
the terrorists

00:52.298 --> 00:53.968
to gain control of the Sentox.

00:54.036 --> 00:55.604
He left me for dead.

00:55.672 --> 00:57.240
BUCHANAN:
Right now,
Henderson is our primary link.

00:57.308 --> 00:58.877
JACK:
You are going
to tell me now
how to find

00:58.945 --> 01:00.112
the rest of the nerve gas.

01:00.179 --> 01:01.381
Do it, Jack.
Get it done.

01:01.449 --> 01:02.317
Shoot me.

01:02.383 --> 01:03.619
( gunshot )

01:03.687 --> 01:05.423
( screaming )
Oh, you son of a bitch.

01:05.489 --> 01:06.692
I shot her above the kneecap.

01:06.759 --> 01:08.362
She can still walk.
Son of a bitch.

01:08.429 --> 01:10.532
You make me shoot her again,
she'll be in a wheelchair

01:10.600 --> 01:12.369
for the rest of her life.
Tell him what
he wants to know.

01:12.436 --> 01:13.638
I can't.

01:13.706 --> 01:15.107
I'm bringing
Christopher Henderson

01:15.175 --> 01:16.912
into CTU.
I'm sorry...

01:16.979 --> 01:18.615
I need an interrogation room
prepped.

01:18.681 --> 01:20.249
I don't care
that you took my wallet.

01:20.317 --> 01:21.820
I just need
to get my keycard back.

01:21.887 --> 01:23.155
It's of no value to you.

01:23.223 --> 01:25.027
It just lets me in and out
of this building.

01:25.094 --> 01:26.595
JENNY:
Okay, you told me
we were just going to take

01:26.663 --> 01:28.599
his cash and a credit card.

01:28.667 --> 01:30.135
That's how I'm getting us
all this money.

01:30.203 --> 01:32.107
$20,000 line
of credit

01:32.173 --> 01:33.743
right here.

01:33.810 --> 01:35.680
Who's going to pay you
that kind of money?

01:35.747 --> 01:36.748
( gunshot )

01:36.815 --> 01:39.020
( screams )

01:40.422 --> 01:42.026
( gunshot )

01:42.092 --> 01:43.193
I have the keycard.

01:43.261 --> 01:44.162
BIERKO:
How long will it take for you

01:44.229 --> 01:45.531
to reprogram it?

01:45.599 --> 01:48.070
Five minutes, and then
we will be able to use it

01:48.138 --> 01:49.807
to access CTU.

01:49.874 --> 01:52.011
Good.

02:20.398 --> 02:23.403
* *

02:43.441 --> 02:46.479
* *

02:58.637 --> 03:00.106
BIERKO:
Yes.

03:00.174 --> 03:01.575
I'm reprogramming

03:01.643 --> 03:03.246
the CTU keycard right now.

03:03.312 --> 03:04.781
Will it work?

03:04.849 --> 03:06.218
I need to change the ID,

03:06.285 --> 03:08.721
but preserve McGill's
executive entry privileges.

03:08.789 --> 03:10.192
It won't be a problem.

03:10.259 --> 03:11.627
Good.

03:11.695 --> 03:13.565
Our couriers are delivering
the canisters to the targets.

03:13.631 --> 03:15.501
They'll be in place soon.

03:15.569 --> 03:17.405
When are you
launching your attacks?

03:17.471 --> 03:19.075
After you're done at CTU.

03:19.143 --> 03:21.046
I'm a few minutes out.

03:21.112 --> 03:22.380
Call me when you're there.

03:22.448 --> 03:24.484
Understood.

03:24.552 --> 03:29.094
( beeps )

03:29.162 --> 03:31.065
( keyboard clicking )

03:34.671 --> 03:36.342
BUCHANAN:
We were able
to neutralize the attack

03:36.407 --> 03:37.343
on the hospital, sir.

03:37.409 --> 03:38.478
Good.

03:38.545 --> 03:40.548
Do we have any idea

03:40.616 --> 03:42.485
what the terrorists'
next target might be?

03:42.553 --> 03:44.623
We're working with federal
and state authorities

03:44.690 --> 03:46.526
to harden security
around the highest-value targets

03:46.593 --> 03:48.062
in Los Angeles.

03:48.130 --> 03:50.567
In other words, no.
We're completely in the dark.

03:50.635 --> 03:51.937
We're just sitting around,

03:52.005 --> 03:53.539
waiting for Bierko
to hit us again.

03:53.607 --> 03:54.876
We do have one
promising lead, sir.

03:54.943 --> 03:58.081
Jack Bauer was able to recapture
the man who escaped,

03:58.149 --> 04:00.252
Christopher Henderson.

04:00.320 --> 04:02.223
Henderson was
a defense contractor

04:02.291 --> 04:04.427
who brokered the sale
of the nerve gas to Bierko.

04:04.494 --> 04:06.731
Is this the same
Christopher Henderson

04:06.799 --> 04:08.937
who worked at CTU?

04:09.003 --> 04:10.873
Yes, sir. He was head
of Field Ops,

04:10.940 --> 04:13.210
until Jack brought him down
on corruption charges.

04:13.278 --> 04:16.416
And this Henderson knows
how to find Bierko?

04:16.483 --> 04:18.421
We believe so,
but he's not cooperating.

04:18.487 --> 04:20.358
Jack's bringing him in
for further interrogation.

04:21.392 --> 04:23.730
Keep me posted
on any progress.

04:23.798 --> 04:25.600
Yes, sir.

04:25.667 --> 04:28.105
Mr. Buchanan,
Tony Almeida's

04:28.173 --> 04:30.242
been asking to see you
down in the Clinic.

04:30.310 --> 04:31.511
I don't have time right now.

04:31.578 --> 04:33.449
Tell him I'll get to him
as soon as I can.

04:33.515 --> 04:34.417
And, Ms. Raines.

04:34.484 --> 04:38.392
Kim Bauer is here.

04:38.459 --> 04:40.527
She's just
clearing Security.

04:46.540 --> 04:48.076
Put her in the Field Ops Office,
please.

04:48.144 --> 04:51.249
Yes, ma'am.

04:59.164 --> 05:02.603
BUCHANAN:
What's Kim Bauer doing here?

05:02.670 --> 05:04.808
Jack asked me to call her.

05:06.445 --> 05:08.013
Does she know?

05:08.081 --> 05:10.051
Not yet.

05:10.118 --> 05:12.423
Who's with her?

05:12.490 --> 05:13.792
I don't know,

05:13.858 --> 05:15.462
but I'll find out
from Security.

05:15.529 --> 05:17.865
Excuse me.

05:17.933 --> 05:20.071
( touch tone beeping )

05:20.137 --> 05:22.341
( phone ringing )

05:23.510 --> 05:24.578
This is Bauer.

05:24.646 --> 05:25.781
Hey, it's me.

05:25.848 --> 05:27.485
Is Burke prepped

05:27.552 --> 05:28.619
for the medical
interrogation?

05:28.686 --> 05:29.620
Yes.

05:29.688 --> 05:32.093
Jack, Kim just

05:32.160 --> 05:33.563
arrived at CTU.

05:33.663 --> 05:35.433
What did you say to her?

05:35.500 --> 05:37.001
Nothing yet.

05:37.069 --> 05:39.139
Good. I want her
to hear it from me.

05:39.207 --> 05:42.178
Jack, it might be easier for her

05:42.246 --> 05:44.450
if she knows that you're alive
before she sees you.

05:44.517 --> 05:46.954
When I first saw you...

05:47.021 --> 05:48.791
It's-it's just...

05:48.858 --> 05:50.894
Yeah, I know.

05:50.962 --> 05:54.100
I-I... I understand.

05:56.105 --> 05:58.041
Look, when you talk to her,

05:58.109 --> 05:59.812
just explain that the reason why

05:59.879 --> 06:01.414
I couldn't tell her
I was still alive was 'cause

06:01.482 --> 06:02.984
I was trying to protect her.

06:03.051 --> 06:04.787
Of course, I will.

06:04.854 --> 06:06.757
Audrey, thank you.

06:11.434 --> 06:13.437
Kim's at CTU right now.

06:15.275 --> 06:17.011
You know, after you died,

06:17.078 --> 06:19.249
Chase left her,
and she hit bottom.

06:19.316 --> 06:21.252
Did you know that?

06:21.320 --> 06:24.358
It's only right now she's
putting her life back together.

06:25.694 --> 06:27.197
Or maybe you did know that,

06:27.264 --> 06:29.201
but you just couldn't
do anything about it, huh?

06:29.268 --> 06:30.504
This doesn't concern you.

06:30.571 --> 06:32.373
Oh, I think
it concerns me, Jack.

06:32.441 --> 06:34.844
Miriam and I were there
for Kim when you weren't.

06:34.911 --> 06:38.451
Whatever you think of me,
we love that girl.

06:47.569 --> 06:50.006
Are you okay?

06:50.074 --> 06:51.476
( sighs )

06:51.544 --> 06:54.181
Both my parents died here.

06:54.249 --> 06:57.754
I swore I'd never come back
to this place.

06:57.821 --> 07:00.092
Well, we can leave
right now if you want.

07:01.462 --> 07:03.465
Here, she's coming.

07:05.202 --> 07:06.770
Kim.

07:06.838 --> 07:08.441
Hi.

07:08.509 --> 07:09.611
Hi.

07:09.678 --> 07:10.747
This is Barry Landes.

07:10.812 --> 07:12.583
Hi.
Audrey Raines.

07:12.650 --> 07:14.051
So, what is it?

07:14.119 --> 07:15.588
What did you have to tell me
that was so important?

07:15.656 --> 07:18.994
I-I think it would be better
if we talked in private.

07:19.062 --> 07:22.134
Whatever you have to say, you
can say it in front of Barry.

07:22.200 --> 07:23.569
Kim, I really think
that that this...

07:23.637 --> 07:25.407
No, no, it's-it's okay.

07:31.419 --> 07:33.021
It's about your father.

07:33.088 --> 07:36.695
What about my father?

07:37.731 --> 07:39.534
He's alive.

07:43.908 --> 07:46.112
Kim, he wanted to tell
you, but he couldn't,

07:46.180 --> 07:47.916
in order to
protect you.

07:47.982 --> 07:50.387
Someone inside the
government wanted
your father dead,

07:50.455 --> 07:53.694
so he staged
his own death and
went underground.

07:53.761 --> 07:56.733
He knew that you
wouldn't be safe

07:56.800 --> 08:00.439
if he told you
that he was alive.

08:00.507 --> 08:04.447
I didn't know either
until this morning.

08:08.121 --> 08:11.327
I thought maybe if I told you
now before you saw him,

08:11.394 --> 08:13.397
it might be a
little bit easier.

08:14.933 --> 08:17.138
He's on his way
in now to CTU.

08:29.060 --> 08:30.898
Hello, Mike.

08:30.963 --> 08:33.836
Mr. Vice President.

08:33.904 --> 08:36.240
I thought you were
in Salt Lake City today.

08:36.307 --> 08:39.379
Hal canceled his engagements
to be here, Mike.

08:39.447 --> 08:42.485
I think you'll agree
we need all hands on deck

08:42.553 --> 08:44.522
to deal with this
Sentox situation.

08:44.590 --> 08:46.193
Of course, Mr. President.
Okay.

08:46.259 --> 08:49.466
So, what's on
your mind, Hal?

08:49.532 --> 08:51.502
Mr. President,
when these terrorists attack,

08:51.570 --> 08:52.872
you're going to need

08:52.940 --> 08:55.243
to maintain order.

08:55.310 --> 08:56.612
And I submit to you,

08:56.680 --> 08:58.282
the plan you're
implementing with CTU

08:58.349 --> 09:00.252
is inadequate.

09:00.320 --> 09:03.425
Sir, it was drawn up
after a careful study

09:03.493 --> 09:05.763
for an attack
of just this magnitude.

09:05.830 --> 09:09.402
CTU is already coordinating
with first responders.

09:09.470 --> 09:13.142
Fine, and they should
still do so.

09:13.210 --> 09:15.815
But what I'm proposing
is something far more sweeping.

09:15.883 --> 09:17.619
And I believe

09:17.685 --> 09:19.856
it's warranted by the facts.
Andrew?

09:21.995 --> 09:24.331
begin with,

09:24.398 --> 09:27.303
I'm revising all
of CTU's casualty estimates,

09:27.371 --> 09:28.740
based on the assumption

09:28.806 --> 09:30.208
that the terrorists will hit

09:30.276 --> 09:32.145
all of these high-profile
targets: hospitals,

09:32.213 --> 09:33.649
malls,

09:33.716 --> 09:35.452
sporting arenas,
transit hubs.

09:35.519 --> 09:37.155
My low estimate is

09:37.222 --> 09:38.791
400,000 casualties.

09:38.859 --> 09:41.997
NOVICK:
Now, that's a considerable
upward revision.

09:42.065 --> 09:43.634
I'd like to know
how you reached it.

09:43.702 --> 09:45.805
Well, you're free to talk
to my working group.

09:45.873 --> 09:47.107
You know, frankly,

09:47.174 --> 09:48.677
I believe that
there are a lot of people

09:48.744 --> 09:50.949
who don't take this threat
seriously enough.
I assure you

09:51.015 --> 09:52.183
we're taking it very seriously.

09:52.251 --> 09:53.520
We have no agenda

09:53.587 --> 09:54.722
but to do so.

09:54.790 --> 09:56.025
Considering these
revised numbers,

09:56.091 --> 09:57.226
what's your
recommendation?

09:57.293 --> 09:59.363
Well, I believe
you should be thinking

09:59.431 --> 10:02.069
of a preemptive declaration
of martial law

10:02.135 --> 10:03.404
in the greater
Los Angeles area.

10:03.472 --> 10:04.741
NOVICK:
Mr. President,

10:04.808 --> 10:07.946
martial law is
appropriate only

10:08.015 --> 10:10.018
as a last-ditch
measure,

10:10.085 --> 10:11.721
not as a preemptive one.

10:11.788 --> 10:13.458
Go on.

10:13.524 --> 10:16.596
Every study we've done
has shown it would
incite more unrest,

10:16.664 --> 10:18.801
not less.

10:18.868 --> 10:20.804
And you couldn't do it without
approval from Congress.

10:20.872 --> 10:24.044
Which is why
we won't call it martial law.

10:24.112 --> 10:25.814
No one is going
to play semantics here

10:25.881 --> 10:27.216
when we're putting troops
on the street

10:27.283 --> 10:29.387
to try to keep people
from killing each other.

10:29.454 --> 10:32.059
You're talking about a panic
that hasn't happened.

10:32.127 --> 10:34.597
Right now, the public
isn't even aware of a threat.

10:34.665 --> 10:38.071
You declare martial law,
you'll have to tell them.

10:39.407 --> 10:40.942
How long would it take
to deploy the troops?

10:41.010 --> 10:42.880
I've already been in touch
with the Pentagon.

10:42.946 --> 10:46.352
National Guard and Army units
are on standby, pending

10:46.420 --> 10:47.689
your decision.

10:47.756 --> 10:50.027
Mr. President, I-I agree
there's a case

10:50.094 --> 10:52.164
to be made, but for God's sake,
let's make it to Congress.

10:52.230 --> 10:53.666
We can declare

10:53.734 --> 10:55.235
an emergency session...
We don't have
time, Mike.

10:55.303 --> 10:56.907
Hal is right.
This-This attack

10:56.973 --> 10:58.643
could take place
any minute.

10:58.710 --> 11:01.081
If CTU can't find this man
Bierko, we're going

11:01.148 --> 11:02.984
to get hit.

11:03.051 --> 11:06.690
It would be smart
to have control of the streets.

11:28.332 --> 11:29.534
This is a mistake, Jack.

11:29.602 --> 11:30.971
You don't want
to do this.

11:31.037 --> 11:32.240
Get out.

11:32.306 --> 11:33.642
I'll get immediate
immunity if I talk.

11:33.709 --> 11:35.011
You know it,
and I know it.

11:35.079 --> 11:37.784
And I'm not even going
to ask for it.

11:37.850 --> 11:39.385
Damn it, Jack.
Will you listen to me?

11:39.453 --> 11:40.588
I'm not trying
to protect myself.

11:40.655 --> 11:42.158
I'm trying to protect
this country.

11:42.225 --> 11:43.360
What do you mean?

11:43.427 --> 11:45.231
You don't want to
know what I know.

11:45.297 --> 11:47.501
You get me to talk,
I promise you

11:47.568 --> 11:48.970
you'll just be opening
Pandora's box.

11:49.038 --> 11:51.041
Tell me, and let me
judge that for myself.

11:52.878 --> 11:55.216
That's what I thought.

12:00.159 --> 12:01.694
BURKE:
I'll set him up in Holding.

12:01.762 --> 12:03.598
Let me know when he's ready
for interrogation.
Yes, sir.

12:03.666 --> 12:04.768
Jack.

12:19.596 --> 12:21.465
Keycard, please.

12:39.500 --> 12:39.706
Oh. All clear, sir.

13:02.534 --> 13:03.936
Yeah.

13:04.003 --> 13:05.905
Okay, well, thanks.

13:05.972 --> 13:07.708
That was Curtis;
he's on his way back

13:07.775 --> 13:08.843
from the hospital.

13:08.911 --> 13:12.549
Okay, good.

13:16.254 --> 13:17.757
Audrey.

13:24.468 --> 13:25.837
Did you speak to Kim?

13:25.903 --> 13:27.973
Yes.
What was her reaction?

13:28.041 --> 13:29.274
She's a little confused.

13:29.342 --> 13:31.479
You should also know
that she's here with someone.

13:31.545 --> 13:33.515
I think it might be
her boyfriend.

13:33.582 --> 13:35.051
His name is Barry Landes.

13:35.119 --> 13:36.220
Where is she?

13:36.285 --> 13:39.023
She's in the Field Ops Office.

13:42.562 --> 13:46.300
Okay, thanks.
Yeah.

14:15.014 --> 14:16.415
Hey.

14:18.452 --> 14:21.024
I don't know what to say.

14:21.090 --> 14:23.260
I don't know what you expect me
to say.

14:23.326 --> 14:26.298
You don't have to say anything.

14:26.364 --> 14:29.102
Why didn't you just tell me
you were alive?

14:29.170 --> 14:31.841
I couldn't.

14:31.907 --> 14:33.243
If you knew
I was alive,

14:33.310 --> 14:34.911
you would
have been at risk.

14:34.979 --> 14:37.015
I had no choice.
You could have chosen

14:37.082 --> 14:40.019
to trust her.

14:42.023 --> 14:44.459
I'd like to speak with
my daughter alone, please.

14:44.527 --> 14:46.129
I don't think
that's a good idea.

14:46.196 --> 14:47.598
I don't care what you think.

14:47.665 --> 14:48.499
I'm sure you don't.

14:48.566 --> 14:50.302
All that matters is you,

14:50.369 --> 14:51.805
and the judgments you make.

14:51.872 --> 14:53.106
Even if it affects
those that love you.

14:53.174 --> 14:54.575
Kim.

14:54.643 --> 14:56.646
Barry, please,

14:56.713 --> 14:59.083
let me speak
to my dad.

15:03.156 --> 15:06.561
I'll be right outside.

15:11.435 --> 15:14.173
Don't judge him.

15:14.240 --> 15:18.980
He was there
when no one else was.

15:26.393 --> 15:29.230
The most painful thing
that I've ever been through

15:29.298 --> 15:31.633
was having to walk away

15:31.701 --> 15:34.738
from you.

15:34.806 --> 15:37.543
Even more painful
than losing your mother.

15:37.610 --> 15:39.880
But it was the only
way to make sure

15:39.948 --> 15:44.120
that you would be safe.

15:44.187 --> 15:45.889
I buried you.

15:45.957 --> 15:51.265
I... I know.

15:51.333 --> 15:53.269
( sighs )

15:53.336 --> 15:55.471
You know, there's something
wrong with people like you.

15:57.507 --> 16:00.011
You can't hold on
to anything.

16:00.079 --> 16:01.313
Chase couldn't either.

16:01.381 --> 16:02.614
He tried for a while,
and then he was gone,

16:02.682 --> 16:04.418
just like you.

16:04.485 --> 16:07.022
And now, you're back...

16:07.090 --> 16:14.066
and I'm just supposed to...

16:14.134 --> 16:16.170
I'm happy that you're alive.

16:16.238 --> 16:19.576
I am.

16:19.642 --> 16:22.613
But I can't give you
what you want right now.

16:24.650 --> 16:29.959
Okay.

16:30.026 --> 16:32.729
I understand that.

16:40.342 --> 16:42.945
I need you to know
that I'm sorry, and I...

16:43.013 --> 16:44.548
Please, just go.

16:47.353 --> 16:49.789
Excuse me.

16:49.856 --> 16:51.959
Burke needs you
in Holding.

16:52.027 --> 16:53.896
I'll be there in a minute.

16:55.800 --> 16:56.867
I've got to go.

16:56.935 --> 16:58.070
Barry's got a conference.

16:58.136 --> 16:59.905
We have a plane
to catch.

16:59.972 --> 17:03.478
Please, Kimberly...
I want you to stay

17:03.546 --> 17:05.515
just a little longer.

17:05.580 --> 17:08.685
There are some things
that I still need to tell you.

17:08.752 --> 17:11.190
Please?

17:11.257 --> 17:14.361
I'll talk to Barry.

17:15.397 --> 17:18.202
Fine.

17:19.971 --> 17:22.273
I'll be right back.

17:51.721 --> 17:56.060
* *

18:05.041 --> 18:09.447
( fan whirring )

18:30.248 --> 18:32.016
BUCHANAN:
You call for me, Tony?

18:32.084 --> 18:33.185
Yeah.

18:33.253 --> 18:35.389
What's going on?

18:35.456 --> 18:37.892
That's what I wanted to ask you.

18:37.960 --> 18:40.296
What do you mean?

18:40.364 --> 18:42.567
What do you think
I mean, Bill?

18:42.635 --> 18:45.706
My wife was killed this morning,
right in front of my eyes.

18:45.771 --> 18:47.774
And nobody here has told me
who did it, or why.

18:47.842 --> 18:50.079
The investigation
is ongoing, Tony.

18:50.145 --> 18:53.116
Come on, Bill.

18:53.184 --> 18:55.354
I used to work here.

18:55.421 --> 18:58.158
I know that's what you say
to people when you don't want

18:58.225 --> 18:59.561
to tell them the truth.

18:59.628 --> 19:02.398
The truth is you're
not an agent anymore.

19:02.466 --> 19:06.405
And what you're asking
me is classified.

19:06.472 --> 19:08.307
Tony, it doesn't
matter what I tell you,

19:08.375 --> 19:09.409
there's nothing you can do.

19:09.477 --> 19:10.911
I know there's nothing I can do!

19:10.978 --> 19:12.981
Look at me, for God's sake!

19:14.485 --> 19:17.656
I just want to know who did it.

19:17.723 --> 19:20.327
I think for the sake
of all the years
I've given this place,

19:20.394 --> 19:22.363
and all the sacrifices I've made
I think, I deserve to know.

19:22.430 --> 19:25.534
Don't you?

19:28.272 --> 19:32.111
All I can tell you is...

19:32.178 --> 19:36.418
Michelle's murder
was part of a bigger plan...

19:36.485 --> 19:38.755
to supply terrorists
with Sentox nerve gas.

19:40.793 --> 19:42.729
Who's behind it?

19:44.799 --> 19:48.537
Who's responsible, Bill?

19:48.604 --> 19:51.074
The highest we've been able
to get up the chain of command

19:51.141 --> 19:53.211
is someone you might know
from when you worked here.

19:53.278 --> 19:55.715
Christopher Henderson.

19:55.782 --> 19:59.253
What?

19:59.321 --> 20:02.125
Why?

20:02.192 --> 20:03.794
We're working
on it, Tony.

20:03.861 --> 20:07.835
Don't let him
get away with this, Bill.

20:07.900 --> 20:10.237
Don't you let him cut a deal.

20:10.305 --> 20:12.508
I won't.

20:47.798 --> 20:50.200
What do we know about the man
who's with Kim?

20:50.268 --> 20:55.843
He's registered
with the state as a
clinical psychologist.

20:55.911 --> 20:58.614
She was his patient?
I think so, yes.

21:03.154 --> 21:05.124
He's ready.

21:07.995 --> 21:11.434
Whatever he's not telling us
is important.

21:11.501 --> 21:17.008
He knows what's coming.

21:17.076 --> 21:19.814
And he's willing tolerate
an inhuman amount of pain.

21:19.881 --> 21:22.751
Open the door.

21:22.819 --> 21:27.024
( door opens )

21:46.891 --> 21:49.426
Damn it, Christopher.

21:49.494 --> 21:52.098
I don't think
you became a part of this

21:52.164 --> 21:54.001
because of self-interest.

21:54.067 --> 21:55.670
I honestly believe
that you think

21:55.738 --> 21:56.872
what you're doing right now

21:56.940 --> 21:58.542
is the best thing
for this country,

21:58.608 --> 22:00.811
but it is not your
choice to make.

22:00.879 --> 22:02.481
That's good, Jack.

22:02.548 --> 22:05.585
Disarm your subject's
resolve by showing empathy,

22:05.653 --> 22:06.620
and respect for his agenda.

22:06.688 --> 22:08.958
This is not a joke.

22:09.026 --> 22:10.594
Thousands of lives are at stake.

22:10.661 --> 22:14.967
people that we promised to
protect, to make feel safe.

22:15.035 --> 22:17.972
There is enough time for you
to tell me what I need to know

22:18.040 --> 22:19.073
to stop this insanity.

22:19.140 --> 22:21.076
Please.

22:21.144 --> 22:24.015
I'm sorry, Jack. I really am.

22:24.081 --> 22:27.386
But I can't tell you
what you want to know.

22:35.734 --> 22:36.109
Start it.

23:38.867 --> 23:39.868
Mrs. Logan.

23:43.306 --> 23:46.275
Mrs. Logan,
if I could have a minute.

23:46.343 --> 23:48.479
If this is about Aaron,
it doesn't concern you.

23:48.546 --> 23:49.746
No, Mrs. Logan, it doesn't.

23:49.814 --> 23:51.182
And I'm not here to discuss it.

23:51.249 --> 23:53.518
What is it?

23:53.586 --> 23:55.787
The country's facing a crisis.

23:55.855 --> 23:58.225
The President needs you.

23:58.291 --> 23:59.593
( chuckles )

23:59.659 --> 24:02.762
He, he needs me.

24:02.830 --> 24:05.133
If you think the decision
to let the attack

24:05.200 --> 24:09.472
on the motorcade proceed was
easy for him, you're wrong.

24:09.540 --> 24:12.443
I was with him when he got
down on his knees and prayed.

24:15.280 --> 24:16.214
He did?

24:16.281 --> 24:17.648
He loves you.

24:17.716 --> 24:19.418
He didn't want to lose you.

24:21.455 --> 24:24.791
But with the lives of so
many people in jeopardy,

24:24.858 --> 24:26.894
he felt he had no choice.

24:32.869 --> 24:36.340
We've known each other
a long time, you and I.

24:36.407 --> 24:37.841
Why don't you stop
talking about

24:37.909 --> 24:39.343
what a positive
influence I am,

24:39.411 --> 24:41.313
and tell me precisely
what it is

24:41.380 --> 24:43.182
you're trying
to get me to do.

24:48.756 --> 24:51.725
Vice President Gardner
is advising your husband

24:51.793 --> 24:55.865
to declare martial law
in Los Angeles in preparation

24:55.932 --> 24:59.001
for the release
of the nerve gas.

24:59.069 --> 25:01.639
He wants to do it
without congressional sanction

25:01.706 --> 25:04.076
or a timetable
to lift it.

25:04.143 --> 25:05.444
He can't just rewrite the law.

25:05.511 --> 25:07.279
Hal's got an agenda.

25:07.347 --> 25:08.714
Well, he's wrong.

25:08.782 --> 25:10.618
This will make things far worse.

25:10.685 --> 25:12.953
Mrs. Logan,
all I know is,

25:13.020 --> 25:15.156
the President is listening
to Hal Gardner.

25:15.224 --> 25:17.859
And it will only
help the country

25:17.926 --> 25:20.463
to have him
listening to you as well.

26:10.762 --> 26:13.030
EDGAR:
No, hold off on deploying
units seven through 12

26:13.097 --> 26:14.799
until we finalize
our target scenario.

26:14.866 --> 26:15.967
What is it?

26:16.035 --> 26:17.704
I was running
a channel clearance,

26:17.771 --> 26:19.673
and I noticed that one
of the environmental systems

26:19.739 --> 26:21.206
put out a trouble flag.

26:21.274 --> 26:23.209
It's probably a tech crew
changing out a circuit board.

26:23.277 --> 26:25.479
That's what I thought, but
I logged on to the manifest.

26:25.547 --> 26:26.548
There's nothing scheduled.

26:26.615 --> 26:27.616
Carrie, I'm in the middle

26:27.684 --> 26:29.017
of coordinating with
first reonders.

26:29.084 --> 26:31.820
We're on high alert; I
don't have time for this.

26:31.888 --> 26:33.490
You don't have to snap at me.

26:33.557 --> 26:35.125
I just thought
someone should check it out.

26:35.192 --> 26:37.194
Then check it out.

26:42.868 --> 26:43.869
Carrie.

27:05.698 --> 27:07.266
( drilling )

27:57.832 --> 27:59.500
Can you forgive me?

28:01.537 --> 28:04.808
You acted like the President
of the United States.

28:04.874 --> 28:08.144
Yes, I did.

28:08.211 --> 28:10.079
But you wanted me to
be your husband first.

28:14.319 --> 28:16.321
Can't pretend that I didn't.

28:18.357 --> 28:22.061
But...

28:22.129 --> 28:25.999
I still love you
as much as I always did.

28:29.572 --> 28:30.506
Martha.

28:30.574 --> 28:33.310
Shh.

28:33.376 --> 28:36.413
There'll be plenty of time
for us later.

28:36.481 --> 28:38.983
You have to get back to work.

28:39.051 --> 28:40.018
The country needs you

28:40.085 --> 28:43.088
more than I do.

28:49.063 --> 28:51.398
Hello?

28:51.467 --> 28:51.885
Anybody working on the system?

30:01.800 --> 30:02.866
Chloe.

30:02.933 --> 30:04.497
Hi, Kim.

30:04.564 --> 30:06.396
You're still here.

30:06.464 --> 30:07.829
Yeah.

30:07.895 --> 30:09.626
Look, my father said that
he had to do something.

30:09.694 --> 30:11.659
You know how long
he's gonna be?

30:11.726 --> 30:12.658
No, sorry.

30:12.725 --> 30:14.622
Chloe...

30:14.690 --> 30:17.089
I'm kind of busy right now.

30:17.155 --> 30:21.584
You knew my father
was alive, didn't you?

30:21.652 --> 30:24.816
For a year and a half
you've known.

30:26.514 --> 30:27.448
Yeah.

30:27.514 --> 30:30.180
He trusted you.

30:30.246 --> 30:32.544
Only because he had to;
I helped stage his death.

30:32.610 --> 30:33.776
You don't have to make excuses.

30:33.843 --> 30:35.474
I'm not making excuses.

30:35.542 --> 30:37.740
Four people knew he was alive,
two of them are dead:

30:37.807 --> 30:39.771
President Palmer,
and Michelle Dessler;

30:39.839 --> 30:42.470
and Tony Almeida's
in serious condition.

30:42.537 --> 30:44.501
Michelle's dead?

30:45.634 --> 30:48.564
The only reason
I'm alive is

30:48.632 --> 30:50.097
because your dad found me
in time.

30:50.165 --> 30:52.063
I know this is
really hard for you,

30:52.130 --> 30:53.296
and it's none of my business,

30:53.363 --> 30:56.260
but you should try
to cut him some slack.

31:02.356 --> 31:03.388
( door opens )

31:05.321 --> 31:08.318
What's going on, Bill?

31:11.481 --> 31:12.480
Lynn...

31:17.444 --> 31:18.443
What is it?

31:20.475 --> 31:24.638
We just got a call from LAPD.

31:24.706 --> 31:26.570
They found your sister's body

31:26.637 --> 31:27.670
in her apartment.

31:27.737 --> 31:30.236
She'd been shot.

31:30.303 --> 31:31.867
What?

31:31.934 --> 31:33.033
I just talked to her.

31:33.100 --> 31:33.999
I saw her today.

31:34.066 --> 31:36.697
That's impossible. She can't...

31:36.764 --> 31:38.995
I'm sorry.

31:39.062 --> 31:41.992
The police ID'd her body.

31:45.058 --> 31:46.057
My God.

31:56.017 --> 31:57.614
If you need a phone

31:57.682 --> 32:03.211
to make some personal calls
or talk to the police...

32:03.279 --> 32:04.910
Her boyfriend did this to her.

32:04.976 --> 32:07.674
Tell me he's
in custody.

32:07.741 --> 32:10.206
Is his name Dwayne Thompkins?

32:10.273 --> 32:11.205
Yeah.

32:11.273 --> 32:12.171
He didn't do it.

32:12.238 --> 32:14.702
They found his body, too.

32:20.865 --> 32:24.263
Lynn, the police are trying
to make sense of something.

32:24.329 --> 32:29.125
Do you know if either
your sister or her boyfriend

32:29.193 --> 32:31.724
were involved
in dealing drugs,

32:31.790 --> 32:34.988
or had ties to....
organized crime?

32:35.054 --> 32:38.784
Uh...

32:38.851 --> 32:42.848
She was a...
pretty serious user.

32:44.747 --> 32:49.576
But organized crime--
no way. Why?

32:49.644 --> 32:54.406
The killings were clearly
the work of a professional.

32:56.538 --> 32:58.603
Oh, my God.

33:00.835 --> 33:03.267
I need to see
preliminary forensics.

33:03.335 --> 33:05.665
Who's investigating?
I have to talk to them.

33:05.732 --> 33:06.764
I can arrange a meeting...

33:06.831 --> 33:07.930
No, I have to talk
to them now.

33:07.997 --> 33:08.896
They have to search
the apartment.

33:08.963 --> 33:10.195
See if my keycard is there.

33:10.262 --> 33:11.328
What are you talking about?
What keycard?

33:11.394 --> 33:12.759
My CTU keycard!

33:12.827 --> 33:13.960
She has it, Bill!

33:14.026 --> 33:15.092
What was she doing
with your keycard?

33:15.159 --> 33:17.123
It was stolen from me,
all right?

33:17.190 --> 33:18.355
Her boyfriend took it.

33:18.422 --> 33:19.354
Why didn't you
report this?

33:19.422 --> 33:20.621
I'm reporting it now!

33:20.688 --> 33:22.086
We don't have time
to argue about this.

33:22.154 --> 33:23.751
Call and see if anybody
used it to breach security.

33:23.819 --> 33:24.751
It was taken about...

33:24.818 --> 33:26.816
about four hours ago.

33:27.982 --> 33:30.446
( phone rings )

33:31.446 --> 33:32.378
O'Brian.

33:32.445 --> 33:34.110
Chloe, I'm in Holding with Lynn.

33:34.178 --> 33:35.609
I need you to check
the gate logs, now.

33:35.677 --> 33:38.407
What am I looking for?

33:38.474 --> 33:40.372
Check and see if anyone
used Lynn's keycard

33:40.439 --> 33:42.038
to enter CTU in
the last four hours.

33:42.105 --> 33:43.071
Isn't Lynn standing
right next to you?

33:43.138 --> 33:44.635
Chloe, do it!

33:46.236 --> 33:47.334
Oh, my God.

33:47.401 --> 33:49.300
It's showing
that his card was used

33:49.366 --> 33:51.531
less than an hour ago
at the executive entrance.

33:51.598 --> 33:52.530
He was already here...

33:52.597 --> 33:54.461
Lockdown CTU now!

33:54.529 --> 33:55.728
This is Chloe O'Brian.

33:55.795 --> 33:57.294
Initiate a lockdown now.

34:00.659 --> 34:01.591
Mr. Bauer, I'm sorry.

34:01.658 --> 34:03.023
I don't know
what's going on.

34:03.090 --> 34:04.621
He should be
talking by now.

34:07.886 --> 34:09.516
Damn it, Christopher.

34:09.585 --> 34:10.851
It's enough.

34:10.918 --> 34:11.983
I don't want to do this.

34:12.050 --> 34:13.049
Just talk to me!

34:13.116 --> 34:14.679
( faintly ):
I can't...

34:14.748 --> 34:15.847
His vitals are crashing.

34:15.914 --> 34:16.879
I need to stabilize him
in the Clinic

34:16.947 --> 34:17.779
before administering
another dose.

34:17.846 --> 34:18.812
( alarm blaring )

34:18.878 --> 34:21.243
( cell phone rings )

34:21.309 --> 34:22.507
This is Bauer.

34:22.574 --> 34:24.206
We've been compromised.

34:24.275 --> 34:25.406
Someone used a stolen keycard

34:25.473 --> 34:26.672
to access CTU
less than an hour ago.

34:26.739 --> 34:27.838
Did you get an ID?

34:27.906 --> 34:29.005
Not yet.

34:29.071 --> 34:29.870
They didn't use
the card to exit.

34:29.937 --> 34:31.069
They're still here.

34:31.136 --> 34:32.235
We're in lockdown,
starting a search.

34:32.301 --> 34:33.800
I'm on my way.
Get him over to medical.

34:33.867 --> 34:34.733
Stabilize him.

34:34.801 --> 34:34.904
Don't let anyone near him.

34:54.634 --> 34:55.632
Did you get him?

34:55.699 --> 34:56.632
Still working on it.

34:56.697 --> 34:58.198
Exits are sealed.

34:58.266 --> 34:59.631
Security cleared Third East,
they're going room to room.

34:59.697 --> 35:01.330
Give me a comm unit.

35:01.396 --> 35:02.662
Audrey, is Kim
still up in Field Ops?

35:02.729 --> 35:03.661
With Landes, yes.

35:03.729 --> 35:04.661
Get her down here.

35:04.728 --> 35:05.660
I want a guard on her.

35:05.728 --> 35:06.727
I'm on it.

35:06.793 --> 35:07.525
EDGAR:
I think I got him in Third West.

35:07.593 --> 35:08.459
He's in processing.

35:08.526 --> 35:10.193
Could exit
south or north.

35:10.260 --> 35:11.192
Jack, take north.

35:11.259 --> 35:12.091
We'll give you updates.

35:12.158 --> 35:13.291
Mac's team
will head south.

35:13.358 --> 35:14.556
Copy that.

35:15.689 --> 35:16.555
Pull up north
and south angles.

35:19.654 --> 35:21.254
There he is.

35:21.320 --> 35:23.019
Edgar, run his face
through recognition software.

35:23.086 --> 35:24.484
Where's Carrie?

35:24.552 --> 35:26.018
We need to check

35:26.085 --> 35:27.583
for grid intrusions.

35:27.650 --> 35:29.815
She's checking on a warning
signal in a B-socket.

35:29.883 --> 35:30.815
Got it.

35:30.882 --> 35:32.348
Checking the grid.

35:45.108 --> 35:46.373
( groans )

35:46.441 --> 35:49.073
You're gonna help me
get out of here.

35:51.471 --> 35:52.503
He's in the north corridor.

35:52.571 --> 35:53.570
Chloe, cover for me.

35:53.637 --> 35:54.736
I want to see
what's keeping Carrie.

35:54.804 --> 35:55.970
Go ahead.

35:56.036 --> 35:57.069
BUCHANAN:
All units,

35:57.135 --> 35:58.235
he's moving west
in the north corridor.

35:58.302 --> 35:59.367
He's got one of our men.

36:16.193 --> 36:17.259
Enter your passcode.

36:17.326 --> 36:18.657
But it's a lockdown!

36:20.791 --> 36:21.890
Just do it.

36:28.287 --> 36:29.919
( beeping )

36:29.986 --> 36:31.618
( alarm blares )

36:39.848 --> 36:42.279
He's in the north stairwell,
sub-level B.

36:43.445 --> 36:44.377
Jack, do you read?

36:44.445 --> 36:45.678
I'm on my way.

37:11.832 --> 37:13.064
Bill,

37:13.132 --> 37:14.031
he's in the stairwell.

37:14.097 --> 37:15.563
I don't think so, Jack.

37:15.629 --> 37:17.495
Davis said he checked
sub-level B.

37:17.563 --> 37:18.895
Bill...

37:18.962 --> 37:20.861
It was all clear.

37:24.392 --> 37:25.724
No, he's doubled back.

37:25.791 --> 37:28.089
He's using the stairs
to get the roof.

37:28.157 --> 37:29.156
All right, Jack.

37:29.224 --> 37:31.621
I'm sending you
into the landings.

37:31.688 --> 37:33.587
Let me know
when you're ready to move.

37:34.453 --> 37:36.153
Copy that.

37:40.151 --> 37:42.216
( alarm continues )

37:52.378 --> 37:53.377
Freeze!

37:54.477 --> 37:55.709
Let me see your hands!

37:56.743 --> 37:58.575
Slowly.

37:58.642 --> 38:00.307
Drop the gun!

38:03.673 --> 38:04.438
Now!

38:16.299 --> 38:17.266
Bill, it's Jack.

38:17.332 --> 38:18.365
Hostile's down.
He's dead.

38:18.431 --> 38:19.531
It was the only shot I had.

38:19.598 --> 38:20.898
Do you have an ID, Jack?

38:22.363 --> 38:23.762
We've got a bigger problem
than that.

38:23.830 --> 38:25.196
He's got a device on him.
Looks like a relay switch.

38:25.263 --> 38:27.527
Hold on.

38:27.594 --> 38:29.493
He's got a PDA.

38:29.560 --> 38:31.758
Oh, my God.

38:31.826 --> 38:33.491
What is it, Jack?
It's a schematic

38:33.558 --> 38:35.057
of CTU's ventilation system.

38:35.124 --> 38:36.756
I think he tried to deploy nerve
gas throughout the building.

38:36.823 --> 38:38.189
Order an evacuation.

38:38.256 --> 38:39.621
Code six!

38:39.688 --> 38:40.621
Everybody out!

38:40.687 --> 38:41.787
Go! Go!

38:41.854 --> 38:43.586
Jack, I have Kim with me.

38:43.653 --> 38:45.619
Stay with her.
I'm on my way.

38:45.685 --> 38:46.818
Make sure Burke
gets Henderson

38:46.885 --> 38:48.084
out of here
as fast as he can.

38:48.152 --> 38:49.084
All right, I'm on it.

38:49.151 --> 38:50.415
Don't move.
I'll be right back.

38:50.482 --> 38:51.414
O'Brian.

38:51.482 --> 38:52.515
Chloe, what's going on?

38:52.581 --> 38:54.114
Edgar, get out
of the building now!

38:56.579 --> 38:58.345
Carrie?

39:01.044 --> 39:03.342
( alarm continues )

39:28.563 --> 39:29.696
We have to get out
of the building now.

39:29.764 --> 39:30.696
What's going on?

39:30.763 --> 39:31.795
Just hurry!

39:32.862 --> 39:34.327
What's wrong
with those people?

39:34.394 --> 39:35.827
Oh, my God.

39:35.894 --> 39:38.992
The nerve gas
is making its way in. Go.

39:39.059 --> 39:40.058
The ducts run
from the outside in.

39:40.126 --> 39:41.024
"Outside in"?!

39:41.091 --> 39:42.157
What does that mean?!

39:42.225 --> 39:43.256
They start at the perimeter

39:43.323 --> 39:44.589
and reach
the building core last.

39:44.655 --> 39:45.788
Auto-lock
the outer doors.

39:45.856 --> 39:46.955
Which rooms can we seal?

39:47.021 --> 39:48.420
I'm working on it.

39:48.488 --> 39:49.920
Burke, I need you to stand by.

39:49.987 --> 39:51.519
We can't leave the building yet.

39:51.586 --> 39:52.852
I'll let you know
where you can move Henderson.

39:52.918 --> 39:54.084
Chloe, what rooms
can we lock down?

39:54.152 --> 39:55.151
Hold on!

39:57.449 --> 39:58.815
We can lock down
the Situation Room,

39:58.882 --> 40:00.748
the upper offices
and Clinic Isolation.

40:00.814 --> 40:02.480
Go, people!

40:02.547 --> 40:03.947
Kim, everybody, in the
Situation Room! Move now.

40:04.013 --> 40:05.278
BUCHANAN:
I'll access Comm from my office!

40:05.345 --> 40:06.377
Burke, you can move

40:06.445 --> 40:07.511
Henderson
to the Clinic Isolation.

40:07.578 --> 40:09.211
Seal it off for bio.

40:09.276 --> 40:11.009
I repeat:
Seal it off for bio.

40:11.076 --> 40:12.042
Get in the Situation Room now.

40:12.110 --> 40:13.508
Move!

40:13.575 --> 40:15.307
Chloe, seal it.

40:15.373 --> 40:16.740
Seal all the rooms.

40:29.134 --> 40:30.100
Open the door!

40:30.167 --> 40:31.532
You have to let me in!
Open the door!

40:31.599 --> 40:32.531
Oh, my God.
Let her in!

40:32.599 --> 40:33.531
We can't break the seal.

40:33.598 --> 40:34.731
You have to try

40:34.798 --> 40:36.430
and find another exit
out of the building.

40:36.497 --> 40:37.463
Hurry! Go!

40:38.763 --> 40:39.862
Chloe, are the rest
of the rooms sealed?

40:39.929 --> 40:41.494
Yes, it's done.

41:08.148 --> 41:10.579
( gagging and choking )

41:12.946 --> 41:14.478
