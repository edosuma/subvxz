WEBVTT

00:01.710 --> 00:03.461
That's it. I'm calling a shelter.

00:03.462 --> 00:04.962
Alia! Oh.

00:07.132 --> 00:10.384
I was just doing a hydrating lip mask.

00:10.385 --> 00:13.304
- This is not drool.
- Do you live here by yourself now?

00:13.305 --> 00:15.097
Did you finally kill both my brothers?

00:15.098 --> 00:19.101
I was just napping
after my four a. M. Jog.

00:19.102 --> 00:21.354
What a workout.

00:21.355 --> 00:24.065
Oh, man, we were at this sick party

00:24.066 --> 00:26.692
at Kendrick Lamar's house.
You guys missed it.

00:26.693 --> 00:29.528
There was this polar bear
on this lil' tiny glacier.

00:29.529 --> 00:30.821
It was so baller.

00:30.822 --> 00:32.740
But also, it made you think.

00:32.741 --> 00:35.117
Benji! You went
to Kendrick Lamar's house

00:35.118 --> 00:37.954
and you didn't FaceTime me
from the bathroom?

00:37.955 --> 00:39.413
What kinda hand soap does he use?

00:39.414 --> 00:41.028
I didn't go in.

00:41.039 --> 00:42.845
I just drove Dean
and waited in the driveway.

00:42.856 --> 00:45.169
I met Mary J. Blige's chauffeur.

00:45.170 --> 00:47.998
- Really down-to-earth guy, great dad.
- Lucky!

00:48.009 --> 00:50.998
We're supposed to be going over the
site for my new store. You're late.

00:51.009 --> 00:52.802
And you smell like a wet goat.

00:52.803 --> 00:53.966
Polar bear!

00:53.977 --> 00:55.137
I'm gonna go shower,

00:55.138 --> 00:57.640
cut my five o'clock shadow,
and then it's on!

00:57.641 --> 01:00.768
Benji, you stayed in a car
the entire night?

01:00.769 --> 01:02.478
Your life is sadder than ever.

01:02.479 --> 01:04.688
I weigh Dean down
at those parties, you know?

01:04.690 --> 01:05.982
Everyone thinks I'm a Postmate.

01:10.779 --> 01:12.613
Oh, my God.

01:12.614 --> 01:15.825
It smells like all the stores
we always get kicked out of.

01:15.826 --> 01:17.201
I'd be careful goin' into that bag,

01:17.202 --> 01:19.413
Dean is like a mama lion with his swag.

01:20.747 --> 01:22.039
Oh, my God!

01:22.040 --> 01:24.793
Day passes to Aftershox Fitness?

01:26.712 --> 01:29.088
I am not comfortable working out
with high-status people.

01:29.089 --> 01:31.674
Someone as short as me has to
be a DJ to work out there.

01:31.675 --> 01:34.093
I don't want to work out there!
I want to go there,

01:34.094 --> 01:35.970
meet cool people, get to know them,

01:35.971 --> 01:37.425
and then copy everything they do.

01:37.436 --> 01:39.477
You should come with me!
You could copy off of me.

01:39.488 --> 01:42.227
- I'm OK. I already have a gym.
- I thought you said your gym closed.

01:42.238 --> 01:44.895
Temporarily. It was just a ringworm
outbreak. How long can that last for?

01:44.896 --> 01:47.523
I mean, are you really asking,
'cause it depends on four factors.

01:47.524 --> 01:49.317
Just think "SLAM." Size, location...

01:49.318 --> 01:50.902
OK, I... I'll go if you stop talking.

01:50.913 --> 01:53.866
- Synced and corrected by Shazi89 -
- www.addic7ed.com -

01:57.200 --> 01:58.754
This is where I belong.

01:58.765 --> 02:01.830
With all the celebrities who aren't
rich enough to have home gyms.

02:04.124 --> 02:05.583
I don't think I'm gonna last here.

02:05.584 --> 02:07.668
Everyone here is the human
equivalent of EDM music.

02:07.669 --> 02:09.794
OK. I'm gonna go watch girls change

02:09.795 --> 02:11.547
but make it look like
I'm adjusting my socks

02:11.548 --> 02:13.549
so I can learn what underwear
cool girls wear.

02:13.550 --> 02:16.136
- Cool girls don't wear underwear.
- We don't know that.

02:22.434 --> 02:25.019
I know it's by the free stuff,
but that one's actually mine.

02:25.020 --> 02:27.229
I'm so sorry. I...

02:27.230 --> 02:28.689
I can put it back into the jar.

02:28.690 --> 02:30.024
It's barely soaked into my skin.

02:30.025 --> 02:31.859
Oh, no, no, no, enjoy it.

02:31.870 --> 02:34.356
It's always great to meet a woman
with similar neck wrinkles.

02:34.367 --> 02:36.447
My mom always told me
that my neck was ugly,

02:36.448 --> 02:38.074
so... take care of it!

02:38.075 --> 02:39.617
That is so true.

02:39.618 --> 02:41.035
Smart woman.

02:41.036 --> 02:42.578
- I'm Nora.
- I'm Esther.

02:42.579 --> 02:44.038
You're so nice and pretty to me.

02:44.039 --> 02:46.957
Thank you. I haven't
seen you around here.

02:46.958 --> 02:49.418
Actually, if you're new,
you have to check out

02:49.419 --> 02:51.420
the saltwater hot tub. It is incredible.

02:51.421 --> 02:52.963
- Really?
- Yeah.

02:52.964 --> 02:54.215
- I would love to.
- Let's go.

02:54.216 --> 02:57.802
You might want to rub in your neck.

02:57.803 --> 03:01.305
Oh, God, this is amazing.

03:01.306 --> 03:03.182
I feel like a matzo ball.

03:03.183 --> 03:05.559
Water can be so healing.

03:05.560 --> 03:08.354
That's actually why
I created my company, RAWATER.

03:08.355 --> 03:11.107
You have a company? What...? Oh, my God.

03:11.108 --> 03:13.109
It's a premium water concept.

03:13.110 --> 03:15.361
Taken directly
from locally sourced streams.

03:15.362 --> 03:17.154
Shut up.

03:17.155 --> 03:18.447
Is that sand at the bottom?

03:18.448 --> 03:19.990
No. It's natural minerals.

03:19.991 --> 03:23.035
Nothing's been added or taken away.

03:23.036 --> 03:25.204
Except the natural minerals,
which have been added.

03:25.205 --> 03:27.248
I actually consider myself
an entrepreneur,

03:27.249 --> 03:29.292
because I upsell used makeup on Reddit.

03:31.086 --> 03:33.921
You know, I'm actually
having some people over tonight.

03:33.922 --> 03:36.048
I think you'd fit right in.
If you're free.

03:36.049 --> 03:37.758
Yes. I would love that.

03:37.759 --> 03:39.760
And, if it is a sleepover situation,

03:39.761 --> 03:41.554
I've got everything I need in my car.

03:41.555 --> 03:44.056
And I know it sounds like
I live in my car,

03:44.057 --> 03:45.850
but I don't. I'm just on the road a lot.

03:45.851 --> 03:47.733
You are so funny.

03:47.744 --> 03:49.718
One of the downsides
of being a driven woman

03:49.729 --> 03:52.148
is sometimes, we forget to laugh.

03:52.149 --> 03:55.734
When I'm around,
people are always laughing.

03:55.735 --> 03:59.447
And it may be at me,
but it also may be with me.

03:59.448 --> 04:00.740
Funny.

04:02.033 --> 04:04.243
Do you wear underwear?

04:10.959 --> 04:13.127
Don't want to let the heat out.

04:13.128 --> 04:16.172
Townhouse Twins! Oh, my God!

04:16.173 --> 04:19.124
I love your show,
"Un-Flipping Believable"!

04:19.135 --> 04:22.178
My family's in real estate, so I feel
like I get a lot of the inside stuff

04:22.179 --> 04:24.306
- you guys are doin'.
- Cool. Thanks for watching.

04:26.016 --> 04:29.393
Eh. So you guys are barefoot in a sauna

04:29.394 --> 04:33.147
in a touristy part of town.
Seems a little risky, no?

04:33.148 --> 04:35.399
Yeah, we're just here, tryin' to relax.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.443
I feel ya, but it's kinda hard to relax

04:37.444 --> 04:39.111
with the threat of ringworm everywhere.

04:39.112 --> 04:42.531
It hit my other gym pretty bad.
It's not a worm.

04:42.532 --> 04:44.255
It's actually a fungus, and it grows...

04:44.266 --> 04:47.953
OK, maybe just sit quietly,
and don't talk.

04:47.954 --> 04:49.997
I am just tryin' to help, guys.

04:49.998 --> 04:51.749
You think jock itch cares
that you're just

04:51.750 --> 04:53.292
tryin' to relax? It does not.

04:53.293 --> 04:56.587
OK, you need to get outta here,
you little fungus perv.

04:56.588 --> 04:58.130
Just sitting there, fully clothed,

04:58.131 --> 04:59.632
looking at our pecs.

04:59.633 --> 05:01.140
I wasn't looking at your pecs!

05:01.151 --> 05:03.594
And now I am, 'cause you brought
it up, and they're nice.

05:03.595 --> 05:05.930
From the sledgehammering I
assume you guys do during demo?

05:05.931 --> 05:08.015
- Just get outta here, man.
- I don't even know why you come here,

05:08.016 --> 05:10.267
with all the demo work you guys do.
It seems like a good workout.

05:10.268 --> 05:12.144
- Go, dude!
- Turn around! Go!

05:12.145 --> 05:14.457
- Close the door!
- Oh, my God. Close the door.

05:14.468 --> 05:17.107
Benji, were you in my swag bag?

05:17.108 --> 05:19.937
Well, what do you have
to say for yourself, huh?

05:19.948 --> 05:21.836
Life comes at you quick,
and before you know it,

05:21.847 --> 05:23.778
you're in your 30s,
living at your brother's house.

05:23.789 --> 05:26.700
You know, I donate these bags
to silent auctions.

05:26.701 --> 05:30.120
So you just stole
from Habitat for Humanity.

05:30.121 --> 05:32.081
- You asshole.
- Are you mad at me?

05:32.082 --> 05:33.332
A little bit, yeah.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.417
But also, I can't lie.

05:35.418 --> 05:37.044
I... I'm kind of impressed.

05:37.045 --> 05:38.462
I mean, usually, you're just, like,

05:38.463 --> 05:40.381
running around,
collecting beetles and stuff.

05:40.382 --> 05:42.091
- They're fish.
- I don't care.

05:42.092 --> 05:43.843
If they're in a tank, it's gross.

05:43.844 --> 05:46.011
Dude, I get why you stole that pass, OK?

05:46.012 --> 05:47.888
You want to be more like me
and less like you.

05:47.889 --> 05:49.265
It's a good instinct.

05:49.266 --> 05:51.600
You know, I have a premium
membership to that gym.

05:51.601 --> 05:54.061
Why don't we go tomorrow?
We could get jacked.

05:54.062 --> 05:55.437
OK, I'll go to your gym with you.

05:55.438 --> 05:56.982
- All right, cool.
- All right.

05:59.693 --> 06:01.643
Nora, your home is so beautiful.

06:01.654 --> 06:04.520
This is exactly the way I always
wanted my SIMS house to look like.

06:04.531 --> 06:08.492
Thank you. Oh, this is my
authentic Kenyan birthing chair.

06:08.493 --> 06:10.286
Cool! Can I sit in it?

06:10.287 --> 06:12.496
No. Uh, and over here,

06:12.497 --> 06:14.206
this is sort of a political piece.

06:14.207 --> 06:16.959
It's a lamp made from the
teeth of ivory hunters.

06:16.960 --> 06:20.296
- Payback's a bitch!
- True.

06:20.297 --> 06:23.799
What is that piece over there?
I am so drawn to it.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.801
It's stunning.

06:25.802 --> 06:28.554
That's a Pyrex dish.
Left here by the caterers.

06:28.555 --> 06:31.557
Ah. Yes. The Pyrex were a noble people.

06:31.558 --> 06:34.602
Funny.

06:34.603 --> 06:36.103
My friends are going to love you.

06:36.104 --> 06:37.730
But first, I have to give my speech.

06:37.731 --> 06:39.189
Hells, yeah! I mean...

06:39.190 --> 06:41.359
I would love a good speech.

06:48.033 --> 06:49.491
<i>Welcome, ladies!</i>

06:49.492 --> 06:51.578
<i>What a terrific month it's been!</i>

06:53.288 --> 06:57.333
<i>We are so proud to be a leader
in global sustainability.</i>

06:57.334 --> 07:01.253
<i>Now, as you know, all of our
bottles are recycled into shoes,</i>

07:01.254 --> 07:04.548
<i>and all of our bottles
are made from recycled shoes.</i>

07:04.549 --> 07:07.051
<i>And remember, ladies, the more girls</i>

07:07.052 --> 07:11.180
<i>you sign up to sell,
the more money flows up to you!</i>

07:11.181 --> 07:13.557
Rawater! Rawater!

07:13.558 --> 07:15.392
RAWATER! RAWATER!

07:15.393 --> 07:18.103
So, this is a...?

07:18.104 --> 07:19.772
Pyramid scheme? Oh, yeah.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.357
Would you judge me if I stayed?

07:21.358 --> 07:25.069
I mean, I've already judged you, so...

07:29.032 --> 07:31.283
Obviously, it's a pyramid scheme.

07:31.284 --> 07:33.035
The "A" is a tiny pyramid.

07:33.036 --> 07:36.121
The "W" is two tiny pyramids
upside-down next to each other.

07:36.122 --> 07:37.414
There's no subtlety here.

07:37.415 --> 07:39.750
I hate to say this,
but I think if selling water

07:39.751 --> 07:42.169
is the price of friendship with Nora...

07:42.170 --> 07:43.928
I'm gonna go ahead and move forward.

07:44.295 --> 07:45.964
How many cases can I put you down for?

07:45.965 --> 07:47.983
I'm not drinking water with sand in it.

07:47.994 --> 07:50.260
Literally the only perk
of living in the United States

07:50.261 --> 07:52.137
is that our water has no sand.

07:52.138 --> 07:54.059
Yo, come on, Benj. Let's go.

07:54.070 --> 07:55.888
Wha... no, no, no, no, no.
What are you doin'?

07:55.899 --> 07:57.393
You look like a Power Ranger
about to go to bed.

07:57.394 --> 07:59.927
What? It's lightweight and breathable.
I got it at N-Rack.

07:59.938 --> 08:01.772
That's what I call Nordstrom Rack.

08:01.773 --> 08:03.023
It's a fun thing I do.

08:05.110 --> 08:08.530
Sorry. It... it's exfoliating my throat.

08:10.073 --> 08:12.074
All right, Benj.
You rip those battle ropes, huh?

08:12.075 --> 08:13.492
All right, how's it feel, huh?

08:13.493 --> 08:15.494
I feel like I'm jerking off
a pirate ship.

08:17.789 --> 08:19.795
- Oh, thank you.
- In all honesty,

08:19.806 --> 08:21.417
it's better with you here.
Yesterday sucked.

08:21.428 --> 08:23.179
Case in point, they bring me towels.

08:27.257 --> 08:28.483
Oh, hey, guys!

08:28.494 --> 08:30.551
I just wanted to let you know
that the other day,

08:30.552 --> 08:33.010
when I said your TV show
was cool, it's not.

08:33.011 --> 08:34.429
I was just being polite.

08:34.431 --> 08:36.306
And the only reason I know about it

08:36.307 --> 08:38.041
is 'cause I got stuck at a Carmax.

08:38.052 --> 08:39.308
They don't let you
change the channel there.

08:39.309 --> 08:41.311
Are you really trying to step

08:41.312 --> 08:43.105
into the townhouse right now, bro?

08:43.106 --> 08:45.065
'Cause you're gonna get demolished.

08:46.067 --> 08:47.359
What are you guys gonna do,

08:47.360 --> 08:48.861
rearrange furniture on me?

08:48.862 --> 08:50.238
Right?

08:52.282 --> 08:54.783
Um...

08:54.784 --> 08:57.536
So, I'm now realizing my
brother's not standing with me,

08:57.537 --> 08:59.538
and I thought this would be, like,
a brother-brother showdown,

08:59.539 --> 09:03.042
but I'm all by myself, and he's
not even within yelling distance.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.863
- Wait, Dean's your brother?
- Yeah.

09:05.874 --> 09:08.047
You guys don't look alike. We don't
look alike. What's the problem?

09:08.048 --> 09:09.798
No. Someone's lying to you.

09:09.799 --> 09:12.384
I mean, your mom clearly had
an affair with Rob Schneider.

09:15.305 --> 09:16.555
Psh.

09:16.556 --> 09:18.015
Where did you go?

09:18.016 --> 09:19.975
The Townhouse Twins just threw towels

09:19.976 --> 09:21.351
at my face and penis, dude.

09:21.352 --> 09:23.520
They told me I look like Rob Schneider.

09:23.521 --> 09:25.939
That's who it is, honestly.

09:25.940 --> 09:27.649
Don't make me work out here.
I don't want to do this.

09:27.650 --> 09:30.402
Look, man. We're not going anywhere.

09:30.403 --> 09:31.779
We're gonna fix this.

09:31.780 --> 09:33.405
Nobody talks smack about my family,

09:33.406 --> 09:35.434
unless it's me, and then
everyone laughs afterward.

09:35.445 --> 09:36.617
Because I'm funny, dude.

09:36.618 --> 09:37.619
Come on, let's go.

09:39.245 --> 09:41.955
Gary, I feel like
you're giving me the runaround.

09:41.956 --> 09:46.126
Your customers want premium water, OK?

09:46.127 --> 09:48.420
Whole Foods is crushing you
in this sector.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.714
Ya need me. Gimme a number.

09:50.715 --> 09:54.176
How many cases can I put ya down for?

09:54.177 --> 09:57.096
Gary... Gary, I... I lost you.

09:57.097 --> 10:01.100
Dean's top three options for
my retail expansion all suck.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.779
One doesn't have a parking lot,

10:02.790 --> 10:05.096
another is next to a restaurant
where they allow children,

10:05.107 --> 10:07.439
and the other is next to a
Yoshinoya Beef Bowl.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.399
Are you... are you talking to me?

10:09.400 --> 10:11.026
What?

10:11.027 --> 10:13.620
Sorry. I'm sorry, I thought
you were talking to me.

10:13.631 --> 10:15.261
But I did want to ask, are we not eating

10:15.272 --> 10:17.437
Yoshinoya Beef Bowl anymore?
I thought it was healthy,

10:17.448 --> 10:18.951
'cause it had the word "bowl"
in the title.

10:18.952 --> 10:20.786
Oh, what is this? RAWATER?

10:20.787 --> 10:22.621
All my customers are obsessed
with this stuff.

10:22.622 --> 10:25.165
Really? You know RAWATER?

10:25.166 --> 10:28.836
Um, you know, if you want to,
I could probably get you

10:28.837 --> 10:31.004
a bulk discount. I know the CEO.

10:31.005 --> 10:34.174
Do you really know her, or do you
just deliver food to her house?

10:34.175 --> 10:37.511
OK, um... I know her. I...

10:37.512 --> 10:40.597
We laugh, we smile.
She's a Pyrex collector.

10:40.598 --> 10:44.143
OK, well, I guess you can
put me down for... 30 cases?

10:44.144 --> 10:46.395
So funny.

10:46.396 --> 10:48.939
The only thing that I don't
trust about this product

10:48.940 --> 10:51.906
- is the fact that you are selling it.
- I do most of my volume over the phone

10:51.917 --> 10:53.460
just for that reason.

10:54.654 --> 10:56.113
Yes!

10:56.114 --> 10:59.241
Hey! Grab your hair dryer,
and blow dry your hair.

10:59.242 --> 11:01.660
Oh, I'm good. I have schnauzer hair.
It self-dries.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.495
Shut up and just do it. Grab it, go!

11:05.123 --> 11:06.608
Hey, what's up, guys? How ya doin'?

11:06.619 --> 11:09.394
Uh, your hair's wet, huh? Yeah, well,
you're gonna have to wait a second.

11:09.405 --> 11:12.245
- Come on, guys. We're in a rush.
- It's so loud, I... I can't hear you!

11:12.256 --> 11:13.463
- It's a... I'm in a wind tunnel!
- A bit loud.

11:13.464 --> 11:15.069
His hair's not even wet!

11:15.080 --> 11:16.383
Oh, you know what, dude?
I just thought of somethin'

11:16.384 --> 11:17.842
that's gonna help you guys out.

11:17.853 --> 11:19.845
Next door, there's a Veggie
Grill, and in the bathroom,

11:19.846 --> 11:21.714
they have one of those
turbo-dryer for your hands.

11:21.725 --> 11:23.015
So stick your head under that.

11:23.016 --> 11:25.017
Yeah, they replaced
meat patties with mushrooms.

11:25.018 --> 11:27.436
Enjoy it, losers.
I'm gonna blow dry my back.

11:27.437 --> 11:29.254
Guys, we gotta be on camera
in 30 minutes.

11:29.265 --> 11:30.522
Oh! That reminds me, dude.

11:30.523 --> 11:33.400
We're more alike than you think.
I also have to be on camera.

11:33.401 --> 11:35.527
Hey, guys, what's up?
We're with the Township Tools.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.279
Isn't that right? Ha!

11:37.280 --> 11:39.281
You know, I know the
Dean Teamers love my hair

11:39.282 --> 11:40.449
lookin' nice and fluffy.

11:40.450 --> 11:42.075
Come on, Dean. This is unreal, man.

11:42.076 --> 11:45.078
Is it unreal? Or is it
"Un-Flipping Believable"?

11:45.079 --> 11:47.164
That's trademarked, bro.

11:47.165 --> 11:48.874
Not cool, man.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.628
That was so sick, man!

11:52.629 --> 11:54.296
You burned 'em
with their own catchphrase!

11:54.297 --> 11:56.403
You know what this is like?
This is like high school

11:56.414 --> 11:58.926
when you beat up Billy Loudon's
ass for pissing on my face.

11:58.927 --> 12:00.469
Yes! You are sick today!

12:00.470 --> 12:02.512
I like using the word "sick" like this!

12:02.513 --> 12:04.307
You can use it! Oh!

12:05.975 --> 12:08.268
Everyone, this is Esther.

12:08.269 --> 12:10.520
She just sold 30 cases.

12:10.521 --> 12:12.189
Hi.

12:12.190 --> 12:14.149
Join us! Have some paella.

12:14.150 --> 12:17.569
Oh. Um. I could stand, or...?

12:17.570 --> 12:20.280
Oh, you know, with your sales,
pull up the birthing chair.

12:20.281 --> 12:21.282
OK!

12:26.204 --> 12:29.206
Whoa! I think I just dilated a little.

12:29.207 --> 12:31.708
Yes, it... it works.

12:31.709 --> 12:35.379
Uh, so we were just discussing
our annual sales trip to Bali.

12:35.380 --> 12:37.714
Now, I don't usually do this,
but Esther,

12:37.715 --> 12:40.133
I think you should join us
for our retreat in Uluwatu.

12:40.134 --> 12:43.095
I have always dreamed

12:43.096 --> 12:44.805
of going to that place you just said.

12:44.806 --> 12:46.348
That's great! So, all you have to do

12:46.349 --> 12:48.193
is sell 50 more cases,
we'll book your flight!

12:48.204 --> 12:50.894
Should be easy for a natural
saleswoman like you.

12:50.895 --> 12:52.604
So easy. Too easy.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.898
I mean, tell me to sell 100.

12:54.899 --> 12:56.775
Just kidding. Keep it at 50.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.221
Can I stand? 'Cause I feel like

12:58.232 --> 13:00.487
everything that's inside of me
is about to fall out.

13:00.488 --> 13:03.463
Oh, man. I forgot that Billy
Loudon kid peed on your face.

13:03.474 --> 13:06.660
It was more of like a spritz, you know?
I was pinned down, squirmin' a lot.

13:06.661 --> 13:08.245
Deano! My bud!

13:08.246 --> 13:09.951
Did you shoot a video
in the locker room?

13:09.962 --> 13:11.623
Oh, yeah, it was hilarious.

13:11.624 --> 13:13.646
Dude, I was laughing so hard.

13:13.657 --> 13:16.119
But, unfortunately, there's no
photography in the locker room.

13:16.130 --> 13:18.005
Hate to do it, but I gotta ban you.

13:18.006 --> 13:19.006
For life.

13:19.007 --> 13:20.007
Are you serious?

13:20.008 --> 13:22.050
I need your key fob.

13:22.051 --> 13:24.011
Whatever, this place sucks anyway. Here.

13:24.012 --> 13:26.847
- I was just tryin' to defend my brother.
- That's your brother?

13:26.848 --> 13:29.641
Yeah. I'm his brother.
What are you so surprised?

13:29.642 --> 13:33.779
Maybe I was conceived next to a
running microwave. Now I'm offended.

13:33.790 --> 13:35.564
So what are you thinking,
you maybe wanna go do, like,

13:35.565 --> 13:37.190
glow-in-the-dark bowling
right now, or...?

13:37.191 --> 13:39.568
Dude, there's not casual
after that just happened.

13:39.569 --> 13:42.572
I'm angry, and you have to let me
be angry. You're walking home.

13:45.193 --> 13:46.776
Hi, I'm a Silverlake mom,

13:46.777 --> 13:50.620
and I'm very wealthy,
and I was just wondering

13:50.631 --> 13:53.299
if you could stock
at your store, please, for me,

13:53.300 --> 13:57.345
just one specific item, RAWATER,
for me and my family, um...

13:57.346 --> 14:02.266
Yes, Gary, ya caught me.
Damn it! Gary...!

14:02.267 --> 14:05.353
I don't think you really want
to go to Bali. You can't swim.

14:05.354 --> 14:08.523
Monkey thievery is through the
roof there. No baguette is safe.

14:09.942 --> 14:11.192
It's not about the trip, OK?

14:11.193 --> 14:12.610
It's about the lifestyle.

14:12.611 --> 14:14.904
Have you even heard of paella?

14:14.905 --> 14:16.656
Yeah, of course I've heard of paella.

14:16.657 --> 14:18.569
Really? 'Cause you've
never once brought it up.

14:18.580 --> 14:20.619
Why would I bring up paella?
It's not the weather.

14:22.371 --> 14:23.704
Did you go jogging without me?

14:23.705 --> 14:25.248
I thought we were workout buddies.

14:25.249 --> 14:26.707
Yeah, well, that was true,

14:26.708 --> 14:29.051
until you got me kicked out
of my own gym.

14:30.108 --> 14:32.692
Well... do you want to go to my gym?
They just reopened.

14:32.703 --> 14:35.067
I thought you got
pink eye there from a towel.

14:35.078 --> 14:38.427
They don't have towel service, Esther. I
got pink eye from the rowing machine.

14:38.428 --> 14:41.193
It's really nice. They just
added stalls to the bathrooms.

14:41.204 --> 14:43.808
- You should come!
- Yeah. Why not, I guess.

14:43.809 --> 14:47.395
Oh, what?

14:47.396 --> 14:50.941
Alia fired me because of
a Yoshinoya Beef Bowl?

14:51.942 --> 14:54.004
Oh. She said that people

14:54.015 --> 14:56.195
wouldn't buy dresses
if they smelled like teriyaki,

14:56.196 --> 14:58.322
but I just want you to know
that I disagree.

14:58.323 --> 15:00.783
I would, I have, I don't care.

15:00.784 --> 15:02.952
So now I gotta get her
a gift to suck up.

15:02.953 --> 15:04.537
You could buy her RAWATER.

15:04.538 --> 15:06.330
Alia loves it. She's addicted to it.

15:06.331 --> 15:08.291
She drinks it up like a hot rich fish.

15:08.292 --> 15:09.417
It tastes like a lake.

15:09.418 --> 15:11.043
I don't personally get it,

15:11.044 --> 15:13.296
but hot pretty girls,
they love fancy water.

15:13.297 --> 15:15.131
Why are there so many triangles on it?

15:15.132 --> 15:18.301
It represents the shoe
to bottle to shoe life cycle.

15:18.302 --> 15:20.469
I could sell you some right now.

15:20.470 --> 15:23.098
All right, yeah, sure.
Send her a case from me.

15:24.266 --> 15:26.517
Uh, well, you know,

15:26.518 --> 15:30.146
The way she was trash-talking
Japanese fast-casual food,

15:30.147 --> 15:32.982
I feel like we're lookin'
more like 50 cases deep.

15:32.983 --> 15:35.027
All right, who cares? Send her 50 cases.

15:40.907 --> 15:45.244
Yes! And just like that,

15:45.245 --> 15:47.371
I'm goin' to Bali, baby!

15:47.372 --> 15:49.415
With a buncha rich pretty girls.

15:49.416 --> 15:51.417
And those little monkeys
better watch their backs

15:51.418 --> 15:55.254
if they come for my baguettes.

15:55.255 --> 15:57.298
I wish this was my first time
saying this to you.

15:57.299 --> 15:59.176
Don't underestimate the monkeys, Esther.

16:01.803 --> 16:03.594
God, this place smells weird.

16:03.605 --> 16:05.389
Well, yeah, it's a lot of
Eastern Europeans,

16:05.390 --> 16:07.627
so, sweating out
pickled fish and cabbage.

16:07.638 --> 16:10.603
I can't believe you work out here.
It's like prison without the hope.

16:10.604 --> 16:12.502
I think it's inspiring.

16:12.513 --> 16:15.191
Look at this guy. He's blind and deaf.

16:15.192 --> 16:17.234
And he whistles every day
in the locker room.

16:17.235 --> 16:18.527
That's gonna be us one day.

16:18.528 --> 16:20.780
No way. The second I get
a liver spot on my shaft,

16:20.781 --> 16:21.907
I'm offing myself.

16:25.702 --> 16:27.495
Uh, hey man, what's the deal
with that, uh,

16:27.496 --> 16:30.623
greasy sweat spot over there?
You wanna maybe wipe it down?

16:30.624 --> 16:34.460
I'm not your housekeeper.
Do I look like housekeeper?

16:34.461 --> 16:38.297
Yeah. You do look like a housekeeper.

16:38.298 --> 16:40.257
Wipe it down.

16:40.258 --> 16:43.219
All right, guys. I think
I'm sensing a little bit

16:43.220 --> 16:47.223
of a culture gap here. Let's not
worry about it. I'll wipe it down.

16:47.224 --> 16:50.476
No, Benj. You use it, you wipe it.

16:50.477 --> 16:51.602
You wipe it.

16:51.603 --> 16:53.229
You wipe it.

16:53.230 --> 16:55.792
You know... I got this, Dean.

16:56.472 --> 16:59.944
Vitaly, hi. I think I recall
a few months ago,

16:59.945 --> 17:02.780
when I was very generous with my
Gold Bond powder, remember that?

17:02.781 --> 17:05.281
Maybe just... go easy on us this time?

17:05.282 --> 17:08.118
Thanks, bud. Appreciate it.

17:08.119 --> 17:09.494
Did you touch Vitaly?

17:09.496 --> 17:11.288
I wouldn't say I touched. I tapped.

17:11.289 --> 17:13.125
Just a... That was a tap.

17:15.669 --> 17:18.712
Hey, uh, what's goin' on, here?

17:18.713 --> 17:20.464
This is how you get
kicked out of my gym.

17:22.509 --> 17:24.551
Now, before we break,
I just want to acknowledge

17:24.553 --> 17:27.179
that Esther shattered her sales goal

17:27.180 --> 17:29.433
and will be joining us in Bali!

17:30.960 --> 17:33.310
Now, Esther, do you want to
share with us how you did it?

17:33.311 --> 17:36.350
I'd be happy to.

17:36.391 --> 17:39.139
I did it all for a little girl.

17:40.045 --> 17:42.393
A little girl named Esther,

17:42.404 --> 17:44.421
whose first grade teacher told her

17:44.432 --> 17:46.574
that she had chubby handwriting.

17:46.575 --> 17:49.525
Well, you know what, Mrs. Dandino,
I'd love to see you write a skinny "B."

17:49.536 --> 17:51.370
Actually, I will take the mic for this.

17:51.371 --> 17:53.247
And if there's a spotlight,
I'll take it.

17:53.248 --> 17:56.542
If not, that's fine. Thank you so much.
Thank you.

17:56.543 --> 17:58.544
Well, we got kicked out
of two gyms in one week.

17:58.545 --> 18:00.348
That's gotta be a personal best for me.

18:00.359 --> 18:02.047
You know what?
At least you really stuck it

18:02.048 --> 18:03.799
to that Russian guy
for me, dude. Thank you.

18:03.800 --> 18:06.635
- Really? -No, dude!
He was gigantic.

18:06.636 --> 18:09.013
Who do you think we are, Double Dragon?

18:09.014 --> 18:11.348
I guess it's best
if we stay in our own worlds.

18:11.349 --> 18:13.142
Yeah, probably.

18:13.143 --> 18:15.311
I was actually happy
in Kendrick Lamar's driveway.

18:15.312 --> 18:17.229
I was humble, I was sitting down.

18:17.230 --> 18:19.273
We're just different.
You don't like cool stuff,

18:19.274 --> 18:20.608
like cars and girls.

18:20.609 --> 18:22.193
I like cars and girls, OK?

18:22.194 --> 18:24.153
I just think they can be
scary and risky,

18:24.154 --> 18:25.591
so, I'm careful.

18:25.602 --> 18:27.646
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm done with this conversation.

18:27.657 --> 18:30.201
Alia, hey.

18:30.202 --> 18:32.996
No, I'm not doin' anything important.

18:36.750 --> 18:40.461
So junior year was the year of dance.

18:40.462 --> 18:41.837
Now...

18:41.838 --> 18:43.172
Oh, excuse me.

18:43.173 --> 18:45.674
Uh, this is actually
one of my top clients calling.

18:45.675 --> 18:48.511
So... listen and learn.

18:48.512 --> 18:51.597
Mr. Dean, how ya been!

18:51.598 --> 18:53.183
Lesson one, keep it fun.

18:53.194 --> 18:55.394
<i>Yo, Esther, what the hell?</i>
<i>I just talked to Alia.</i>

18:55.405 --> 18:56.594
<i>She hates that garbage water.</i>

18:56.605 --> 18:58.145
She said it's so matcha now.

18:58.146 --> 19:00.022
I understand you're upset.

19:00.023 --> 19:03.317
What if I told you I had
some free RAWATER trucker hats

19:03.318 --> 19:05.319
I was gonna throw in there for you?

19:05.320 --> 19:07.863
In a lurch, try free merch.

19:07.864 --> 19:09.740
You know what?
I can't believe I got duped

19:09.741 --> 19:12.284
by some friendless loser that's
always crashin' at my place.

19:12.285 --> 19:13.828
Because of your stupid "Paw Patrol,"

19:13.829 --> 19:16.539
I have no more room in my DVR
for my "NYPD Blue."

19:16.540 --> 19:19.166
<i>You know what? Alia and I
are both canceling our orders.</i>

19:19.167 --> 19:20.459
How 'bout that?

19:20.460 --> 19:23.379
And thank you so much for the feedback.

19:23.380 --> 19:25.173
I... Thank you, I appreciate it.

19:27.676 --> 19:31.804
OK, well, uh, setbacks happen, right?

19:31.805 --> 19:34.473
If you think that losing all my sales

19:34.474 --> 19:36.058
in one humiliating phone call

19:36.059 --> 19:38.435
is gonna stop me, you're wrong!

19:38.436 --> 19:40.396
Wait, those were
all of your sales, Esther?

19:40.397 --> 19:42.398
Yes, but I plan
to hit the ground running

19:42.399 --> 19:45.067
when we all get to Bali, baby!

19:45.068 --> 19:47.903
Bali is for top sellers only, Esther.

19:47.904 --> 19:50.614
Um, that's OK.

19:50.615 --> 19:53.493
I don't have a passport,
and I don't know how to get one.

20:01.042 --> 20:03.043
Hey. Did I fall asleep?

20:03.044 --> 20:05.254
- Yeah.
- How long was I out for?

20:05.255 --> 20:08.632
It's five a. M. You were
drooling, so I shut your jaw.

20:08.633 --> 20:11.594
I coulda drowned. How was the sunrise?

20:11.595 --> 20:14.638
You know, I think I'm more of a
sunset guy. The sunrise was OK.

20:14.639 --> 20:17.182
The sun sorta rose above...

20:17.183 --> 20:18.809
Hey. I'm on one percent.

20:18.810 --> 20:20.102
Sorry.

20:20.103 --> 20:22.897
Uh, so we just started a, uh, jam sesh,

20:22.898 --> 20:25.149
and then they rolled out some B12 shots.

20:25.150 --> 20:26.734
So, probably gonna be a few more hours.

20:26.745 --> 20:29.862
Don't worry about it. We can stay
here forever. We'll just watch TV.

20:29.863 --> 20:31.906
Oh, I don't want you
watchin' my car Hulu.

20:31.907 --> 20:34.950
You're gonna screw up my algorithms
with your weird British comedies.

20:34.951 --> 20:36.430
Favorite part of British comedies -

20:36.441 --> 20:38.621
when they say, "isn't it,"
'cause they go, "intit."

20:38.622 --> 20:40.080
- "Intit."
- It's more like, "innit,"

20:40.081 --> 20:41.248
but, anyway...

20:41.249 --> 20:43.125
- You could do British comedy.
- Yeah.

20:43.126 --> 20:45.789
- You fink I could do British comedy?
- Oh, my God!

20:45.800 --> 20:47.546
- Funny. But I gotta go in.
- You still got it, kid!

20:47.547 --> 20:48.548
I gotta go.

20:48.559 --> 20:50.722
