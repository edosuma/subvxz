That's what I had to come back
here for. Sorry about that.

11:40.572 --> 11:44.407

- Dr. Venture: Come on, Brock. You never could lie to me.

11:44.409 --> 11:47.026

- Brock: Doc, I really got to go.

- Enjoy, guys.
- What were you thinking?! We're mixing drinks.

12:06.564 --> 12:10.883
- Beer before liquor, never been sicker.
- Then drink yours fast.

12:10.885 --> 12:13.569
- Never.
- You made it. Welcome. Welcome.

Is that G-g-g-g-galacticon? [ Laughs ]

12:21.246 --> 12:25.898
I didn't know Vendata was into rough
trade. That Galacticon guy is in here

12:25.900 --> 12:30.002
- every week picking up a new John.
- And here is another thing

12:30.004 --> 12:35.064
that has always vexed me about that
show. Why do they call it "chips" as

12:35.099 --> 12:38.044
an acronym for California Highway
Patrol? It should logically be

12:38.046 --> 12:44.393
- pronounced "chipes," with a long "i." 
- My co-workers I told you about. 

12:44.428 --> 12:46.585
- I should probably say "hello."
- Great.

12:46.587 --> 12:51.474

- No. No. I will only be a moment.

- Ugh, right?

13:12.997 --> 13:16.615
- Jungle is so '90s.
- Brock: All right. I'm gonna go look for ghost ...

13:16.617 --> 13:21.837

the door in case things get weird... er.

13:25.842 --> 13:28.844
Ooh, somebody's been working out.

No. He's still mixing 

13:57.658 --> 13:59.592

- Dr. Venture: [ chuckles ] That thing.

13:59.594 --> 14:02.495
<i>No wonder you were

14:02.947 --> 14:04.132
Brock: Hey.

14:04.167 --> 14:05.658
- Greetings, Brock Samson.
- Brock: Shh.

14:05.716 --> 14:08.117
Apologies. 
I regret to report my date is

not going well.
Conversation ... strained.

14:10.521 --> 14:13.505
- Rapport ... wanting.
- Brock: Never mind about that. We're aborting.

14:13.507 --> 14:16.175
- Where's Vendata?
- He ditched me for his co-workers.

14:16.177 --> 14:19.862
- Brock: No. Don't point.
- Well, I just wanted to say "hello."

14:19.864 --> 14:23.349
- I do not want to leave my friend waiting.
- Don't look now, Vendata, but

14:23.351 --> 14:27.286
your so-called "friend" looks like
he found himself another "friend."

14:27.288 --> 14:31.207
- That Yeti Mummy is oddly familiar.
- 20 bucks says Galacticon gets

14:31.209 --> 14:37.029
him down to the bathroom in less
than five minutes. Guy's into bears.

15:07.417 --> 15:09.161
<i>Dr. Venture: Well, he didn't say exactly.</i>

15:09.163 --> 15:12.662
- I, uh... kind of followed him.
- Quizboy: Wait a minute. 

15:12.798 --> 15:16.402
- Are we even invited to this thing?
- Dr. Venture: Hey, if he's gonna borrow my costume, I think

15:16.404 --> 15:19.455
- I'm entitled to go to his costume party.
- Quizboy: What party?

15:19.457 --> 15:22.518
- Do you hear any music? There
isn't even a door on this.

15:22.553 --> 15:27.430
- Dr. Venture: Well, here. Take a peek in that window.
- Quizboy: There's nothing. It's a big elevator shaft.

- Oh, no, please. After you.

I just call them like I see them.

Sorry to bother you, boss,
but, uh, Dr. Venture just walked

16:32.196 --> 16:35.448
in with a one-eyed midget,
pretending to be a Ventriloquist act.

but I must run. Boss is always on
