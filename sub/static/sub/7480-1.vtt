00:03.700 --> 00:05.618
Hetty has resigned
her position.

00:05.702 --> 00:06.919
- Who are you?
- Lauren Hunter.

00:07.004 --> 00:07.787
Her replacement.

00:07.871 --> 00:09.255
Zulu-November.

00:09.339 --> 00:11.090
Operation Comescu.

00:11.175 --> 00:12.642
You are not longer
on this case, Agent Callen.

00:12.709 --> 00:15.294
Operation Comescu
is all about you.

00:18.966 --> 00:21.551
Find her, Agent Hunter,
before they all get killed.

00:21.602 --> 00:24.520
(shouting, gunfire)

00:24.588 --> 00:26.138
- Hetty's alive.
- Where?

00:34.815 --> 00:36.282
HETTY:
<i>I have a message</i>

00:36.366 --> 00:38.251
for the head of
the Comescu family.

00:38.318 --> 00:40.820
I am the head
of the Comescu family.

00:40.904 --> 00:42.205
HETTY:
Callen died

00:42.272 --> 00:43.489
three weeks ago.

00:43.574 --> 00:45.374
And why should I trust you?

01:03.677 --> 01:06.729
(men shouting,
gunfire in distance)

01:14.104 --> 01:16.172
They are coming?

01:17.591 --> 01:19.609
(gunfire continues)

01:26.450 --> 01:28.501
(shouting, gunfire continue)

01:32.155 --> 01:34.473
(gunshot)

01:34.541 --> 01:36.626
(grunts quietly)

01:39.363 --> 01:41.380
(grunts quietly)

01:42.332 --> 01:43.683
(sighs)

01:54.778 --> 01:56.445
Let them come.

<i>Dulceata.</i>

03:08.279 --> 03:10.297
I learned this from my mother.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.134
She learned it from her mother.

03:15.804 --> 03:18.422
And her mother from hers.

03:18.473 --> 03:20.474
And so on.

A family tradition then--

03:26.798 --> 03:29.283
preservation.

03:29.351 --> 03:34.038
Some things are more important
to protect than others.

03:34.105 --> 03:36.106
Yes, they are.

03:40.662 --> 03:45.282
This feud--
how long has it been going on?

03:46.985 --> 03:49.803
Since the war.

03:49.871 --> 03:52.122
Now...

03:52.173 --> 03:54.558
it's over.

03:54.626 --> 03:57.044
Is it?

04:01.316 --> 04:03.333
(seagulls cawing)

04:16.781 --> 04:19.366
SAM: I need to know
you're gonna be okay.

04:21.519 --> 04:24.788
I said, I need to know
you're gonna be okay.

04:25.857 --> 04:27.875
Yeah.

04:27.959 --> 04:30.160
I'm all right.

04:30.228 --> 04:32.746
Because if you're not gonna be
okay, and you're gonna lose it

04:32.831 --> 04:34.531
when you're supposed
to be watching my back,

04:34.599 --> 04:35.749
I'd like to know.

04:37.802 --> 04:40.421
That's the Black Sea.

04:42.490 --> 04:45.326
Yes, it is.

04:45.393 --> 04:48.796
I always assumed
it was the Pacific.

04:50.281 --> 04:52.833
California.

04:52.901 --> 04:56.270
You do know
where we are.

04:56.354 --> 04:58.222
Romania.

04:58.289 --> 05:01.325
SAM: We need to get off the
street, figure out a plan.

05:01.392 --> 05:03.661
CALLEN: Couple blocks back,
there are some workshops,

05:03.728 --> 05:05.562
old warehouses.

05:05.613 --> 05:07.848
Auto trade mostly.

05:07.916 --> 05:10.868
Preferably an alleyway, in
case we need to get out fast.

05:10.919 --> 05:12.870
Workshop, warehouses
and alleys.

05:12.937 --> 05:14.905
Got it.

05:21.262 --> 05:23.364
How do you know this place?

05:23.431 --> 05:25.716
I was born here.

05:30.689 --> 05:32.940
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?

05:33.024 --> 05:35.059
Coffee, black.
Sugar, brown.

05:35.110 --> 05:37.061
Brewed, not stewed,
and Oreos...

05:37.112 --> 05:38.762
if you want 'em.

05:38.813 --> 05:40.531
No food or beverages in ops.

05:40.598 --> 05:42.099
Who says?

05:42.150 --> 05:45.102
Doesn't seem right.

05:46.154 --> 05:47.821
She's not here, Eric.

05:47.906 --> 05:49.272
No, she's not.

05:49.324 --> 05:50.624
She resigned.

05:50.709 --> 05:51.959
Yes, she did.

05:52.043 --> 05:53.577
She's somewhere
in Eastern Europe.

05:53.628 --> 05:54.912
Most likely.

05:54.963 --> 05:57.247
She has zero control
over what you do,

05:57.298 --> 06:00.634
what you say, or what
rules you choose to break.

06:05.306 --> 06:07.307
And yet...

06:11.980 --> 06:14.248
(slurps)

06:14.315 --> 06:16.483
Did you say Oreos?

06:18.069 --> 06:21.088
No credit card usage.

06:21.156 --> 06:23.157
No hotels booked
under her alias.

06:23.241 --> 06:24.725
No contact.

06:24.793 --> 06:26.910
Nothing since
that taxi dropped Hetty off

06:26.978 --> 06:28.979
at the address in Prague.

06:29.030 --> 06:31.115
It's owned
by a Comescu family company.

06:31.166 --> 06:32.816
(typing)
Let's see.

06:32.867 --> 06:34.451
It's a residential area.

06:34.502 --> 06:36.503
Probably a safe house,
or maybe a courier drop,

06:36.588 --> 06:37.788
but nothing
that makes it stand out--

06:37.839 --> 06:39.106
(two beeps)

06:39.174 --> 06:40.741
Whoa.

06:40.809 --> 06:42.042
What?

06:42.127 --> 06:43.877
It's a wire report
out of Prague.

06:43.962 --> 06:46.563
There was a shooting
at that address overnight.

06:48.183 --> 06:49.333
It's being

06:49.400 --> 06:51.018
reported as a gangland war.

06:51.102 --> 06:53.854
Five dead.

06:53.938 --> 06:55.856
All of them Romanian.

06:55.940 --> 06:58.375
One was a Comescu.

06:58.443 --> 07:00.861
(sirens wailing on video) I just got
off the phone with Interpol.

07:00.945 --> 07:03.346
Said it was more
like a military black op

07:03.398 --> 07:05.466
than a gangland shootout.

07:05.533 --> 07:07.351
When?

07:07.418 --> 07:09.453
Just after 10:00,
local time.

07:09.520 --> 07:12.522
Six hours after Callen
and the others landed in Prague.

07:17.462 --> 07:20.197
Officially, we only have one
agent in that part of the world.

07:20.248 --> 07:21.665
Of course, Director,

07:21.716 --> 07:23.984
and that's obviously
what you came to tell us.

07:28.056 --> 07:29.156
Director?

07:30.225 --> 07:32.876
That one agent--
would that be

07:32.927 --> 07:34.061
Agent Hunter?

07:34.145 --> 07:36.146
Agent Hunter is making enquires

07:36.214 --> 07:38.182
about a former employee.

07:38.249 --> 07:40.067
Which would be Hetty.

07:40.151 --> 07:41.618
Miss Lange, yes.

07:41.686 --> 07:43.386
Hmm.

07:43.438 --> 07:45.689
Uh... any news

07:45.740 --> 07:48.058
from Agent Hunter?

07:52.030 --> 07:54.748
If you find anything,
let me know.

08:06.878 --> 08:09.763
So, uh, judging
by the dust,

08:09.848 --> 08:13.267
I think we got a good 30 years
before anybody comes back.

08:17.605 --> 08:20.274
SAM: We got to find out
what we're up against.

08:20.358 --> 08:22.893
The Comescus probably heard
about the shooting in Prague,

08:22.944 --> 08:24.478
but we got here fast.

08:24.562 --> 08:28.899
They'll be expecting us,
but not yet.

08:28.950 --> 08:31.118
KENSI: Well, what if
Hetty's already gone?

08:31.202 --> 08:33.736
What if they've already
moved her from the beach house?

08:33.788 --> 08:35.739
She's here.

08:35.789 --> 08:37.291
They haven't moved her.

08:37.375 --> 08:39.275
You want to share?

08:39.327 --> 08:41.611
This is where they live.

08:41.663 --> 08:43.246
It's where
they feel safe.

08:47.302 --> 08:49.452
Go play tourist.

08:49.504 --> 08:52.122
Count heads, map out
the perimeter.

08:52.173 --> 08:53.590
Back in 30.

08:53.641 --> 08:55.676
You got it.

09:08.106 --> 09:10.824
You got 30 minutes.

09:12.410 --> 09:14.328
To do what?

09:14.412 --> 09:16.863
To tell me what
just happened on the beach.

09:22.086 --> 09:24.922
So...

09:24.989 --> 09:27.157
you are <i>familia.</i>

09:27.208 --> 09:29.426
Roma.

09:29.493 --> 09:31.178
Gypsy.

09:33.214 --> 09:36.266
I was born after the war,

09:36.334 --> 09:38.852
in a refugee camp in Bucharest.

09:38.937 --> 09:42.155
And your parents?

09:45.226 --> 09:47.177
Two years...

09:47.228 --> 09:50.180
in a German death camp.

09:50.231 --> 09:54.401
My father died two months
before I was born.

09:54.469 --> 09:57.321
My mother...

09:57.388 --> 09:59.373
two days after.

10:01.159 --> 10:04.711
A family
in the camp raised me.

10:05.964 --> 10:08.531
They were also Roma.

10:08.583 --> 10:11.818
And what was this family's name?

10:12.870 --> 10:14.888
Pavlenco.

10:19.177 --> 10:21.161
You lie.

10:23.214 --> 10:26.049
I most certainly
do not lie, Alexa.

10:35.777 --> 10:39.246
Taken yesterday
at Prague airport.

10:40.615 --> 10:42.883
You lie, Henrietta.

10:44.335 --> 10:45.619
You lie.

10:46.270 --> 10:50.107
You lie.

10:50.174 --> 10:52.125
You lie.

11:09.112 --> 11:13.616
ALEXA: You killed two
of our people in Prague.

11:15.001 --> 11:19.004
And these killed five more.

11:21.341 --> 11:25.628
One of them a nephew.

11:29.833 --> 11:32.835
And you make soup.

11:44.848 --> 11:48.434
These agents-- they come for me?

11:48.502 --> 11:51.153
No, me.

11:54.157 --> 11:56.091
To kill you?

11:56.159 --> 11:59.712
No, to save me.

12:05.802 --> 12:09.922
You try to save this one
by bringing me evidence

12:10.006 --> 12:12.892
he is dead.

12:12.976 --> 12:16.545
Call it a final attempt
to end the bloodshed

12:16.596 --> 12:19.481
between his family and yours.

12:21.484 --> 12:25.437
I'm sure you knew it must fail,

12:25.505 --> 12:27.740
which leaves me to wonder,
Henrietta Lange,

12:27.824 --> 12:33.245
why, exactly,
did you come?

12:41.421 --> 12:44.707
She went to protect Callen.

12:44.758 --> 12:47.126
Callen's perfectly capable
of protecting himself.

12:47.210 --> 12:49.745
- And then some.
- Mm.

12:49.796 --> 12:51.347
So why did she go?

12:51.414 --> 12:54.600
Director Vance said
it was a thin file.

12:54.684 --> 12:57.920
Maybe there wasn't enough
evidence to make a case.

12:57.971 --> 12:59.188
Hmm, but she must
have known

12:59.255 --> 13:00.589
Callen would have come
after her.

13:00.640 --> 13:03.592
Wherever Callen goes,
Sam goes, and Kensi.

13:03.660 --> 13:04.977
And Deeks.

13:05.061 --> 13:06.712
What if she couldn't get
approval to run the operation,

13:06.780 --> 13:08.647
so instead she puts
herself out there,

13:08.732 --> 13:10.699
knows they'll all
come to back her up?

13:10.767 --> 13:12.234
Kind of a desperate play.

13:12.285 --> 13:14.203
Yeah, but what if
she had no choice?

13:14.270 --> 13:15.321
They were about to
come after Callen.

13:15.405 --> 13:16.538
Offense is the
best defense.

13:16.606 --> 13:19.325
Mm.

13:19.409 --> 13:21.043
Wait, what did you say?

13:21.110 --> 13:22.444
Offense is the best defense?

13:22.495 --> 13:26.081
No, no, before that,
you said it was a thin file.

13:26.132 --> 13:27.299
I didn't say that;
Director Vance did.

13:27.384 --> 13:28.434
I heard him telling Callen.

13:28.501 --> 13:30.953
Okay, but the file
Hetty erased was a big file--

13:31.004 --> 13:34.373
20 megabytes, at least;
hundreds of pages.

13:34.441 --> 13:37.927
Maybe it was all for show
so we'd stop looking?

13:38.945 --> 13:40.963
Two files.

13:41.982 --> 13:45.818
A fat file for show
and a thin file,

13:45.902 --> 13:48.354
and if she only erased one...

13:48.438 --> 13:51.106
Then the real Comescu
file is still in there.

13:58.315 --> 14:00.382
You gonna tell me
what spooked you?

14:00.450 --> 14:03.702
You said I had 30 minutes;
it's only been seven.

14:03.787 --> 14:05.988
How long is it gonna
take you to tell me?

14:06.039 --> 14:08.040
About a minute.

14:08.124 --> 14:09.258
Then you got 22 minutes.

14:09.325 --> 14:11.326
Good.

14:15.198 --> 14:17.132
That's the third time
you've stripped that pistol.

14:17.183 --> 14:19.435
You'll wear it out.

14:19.502 --> 14:22.137
Yeah, just load
your ammo, okay?

14:25.308 --> 14:29.728
(sighs)

14:34.200 --> 14:36.151
Those memories
I told you about--

14:36.202 --> 14:38.570
the guy giving me
the toy soldier.

14:38.655 --> 14:40.456
I always just assumed
that's where it took place--

14:40.523 --> 14:42.574
on a local beach,
kids playing.

14:44.110 --> 14:45.711
I was making sand castles.

14:53.970 --> 14:56.388
This is where I'm from, Sam.

14:56.473 --> 14:59.008
How can you be so sure?

14:59.059 --> 15:00.392
I remembered...

15:03.346 --> 15:05.297
...a woman.

15:05.365 --> 15:06.865
(laughs)

15:08.768 --> 15:10.786
My mother.

15:17.494 --> 15:20.112
They shot her.

15:26.235 --> 15:29.405
If you tell me...

15:29.472 --> 15:32.041
how this all started...

15:32.992 --> 15:35.911
...I'll tell you
why I came.

15:46.856 --> 15:49.942
In the war...

15:50.026 --> 15:52.311
my grandfather did
what he had to do

15:52.395 --> 15:54.696
to keep his family safe.

15:55.815 --> 15:58.534
Safe from the death camps.

16:00.954 --> 16:04.823
Late in the war,
there was a coup.

16:06.459 --> 16:09.878
The power shifted.

16:09.946 --> 16:12.748
From being someone the
government could rely on,

16:12.799 --> 16:13.732
my grandfather

16:13.800 --> 16:18.270
became someone
to be despised.

16:22.092 --> 16:24.309
There was an American.

16:25.678 --> 16:28.296
OSS.

16:28.348 --> 16:30.415
You know of the OSS?

16:30.483 --> 16:33.952
Now the CIA.

16:35.655 --> 16:39.525
This American hunted

16:39.609 --> 16:43.529
my grandfather down
and killed him,

16:43.613 --> 16:46.632
along with two
of his brothers.

16:50.336 --> 16:52.838
This OSS agent was

16:52.922 --> 16:55.390
Callen's grandfather.

16:58.678 --> 17:02.247
And the Comescu family
responded in kind?

17:03.299 --> 17:06.617
It took two years to find him.

17:06.685 --> 17:11.607
He had married a Roma girl,
they had... a child.

17:14.676 --> 17:17.880
My father was the
one to find him.

17:17.946 --> 17:20.449
The mother and child--
a daughter--

17:20.516 --> 17:23.367
escaped to America.

17:24.404 --> 17:26.905
But it didn't end there.

17:27.924 --> 17:31.160
25 years later,
the daughter came back.

17:31.211 --> 17:33.495
She had changed her name.

17:33.546 --> 17:35.814
She had two children.

17:35.882 --> 17:39.201
A girl and a boy.

17:39.269 --> 17:43.872
My father swore
on his father's grave

17:43.923 --> 17:46.341
to end their bloodline.

17:48.344 --> 17:50.896
She died not far

17:50.980 --> 17:55.434
from here on a beach
while her son played.

17:58.054 --> 18:00.889
He won't go easily.

18:00.940 --> 18:04.726
No, he won't.

18:05.745 --> 18:07.746
It is in his blood.

18:13.086 --> 18:16.054
Why did you come?

18:17.090 --> 18:20.459
To make amends.

18:23.046 --> 18:24.963
Big smile.

18:25.031 --> 18:26.748
This one's going to be
for the album.

18:26.799 --> 18:29.401
What album is this?

18:30.436 --> 18:33.472
Honeymoon, yeah?

18:33.556 --> 18:35.090
Honeymoon?

18:35.141 --> 18:38.426
We are on honeymoon in Romania?

18:38.478 --> 18:39.561
Romantic Romania.

18:39.612 --> 18:41.129
Look at this place--
it's perfect.

18:41.197 --> 18:42.547
Yeah? Well,

18:42.615 --> 18:45.050
I don't see a ring on
this finger, lover-boy.

18:45.118 --> 18:47.035
Well, that's because you,
darling,

18:47.103 --> 18:49.104
left it at the hotel
when we went swimming.

18:49.155 --> 18:50.989
Swimming? And our
swimsuits are...?

18:51.057 --> 18:53.208
Optional.

18:53.276 --> 18:54.326
(laughs)
Our swimsuits are optional.

18:54.410 --> 18:55.627
Actually, you know what?

18:55.712 --> 18:57.663
There's a swimsuit-optional
beach right up there,

18:57.747 --> 19:00.299
and, yep, the batteries
are fully charged.

19:00.383 --> 19:01.783
We could do this.

19:01.834 --> 19:04.336
Yeah, well, I'm really sorry,
not today, little brother.

19:04.420 --> 19:05.737
Little brother--
are you kidding me?

19:05.805 --> 19:08.140
Why's it always got to be the
brother-sister thing with you?

19:08.224 --> 19:10.175
Well, we're
on a family vacation, so

19:10.260 --> 19:11.860
keep snapping.
All right.

19:14.063 --> 19:16.848
Two guys leaving the house.

19:24.257 --> 19:26.375
Well, it hasn't been partitioned
on the main drive.

19:26.442 --> 19:29.978
Nothing on the user
or new file logs.

19:30.029 --> 19:30.979
It's not here.

19:31.030 --> 19:32.114
It's got to be here.

19:32.165 --> 19:33.765
It can't be anywhere else.

19:33.833 --> 19:37.119
Okay, so if you were Hetty,
where would you hide a file

19:37.170 --> 19:40.339
on a server that you didn't
want anyone else to find?

19:40.423 --> 19:42.424
In plain sight.

19:43.826 --> 19:45.827
She wouldn't,
would she?

19:49.265 --> 19:51.350
(scoffs) She made a simple
copy and parked it.

19:51.434 --> 19:53.719
The Comescu file has been
right there all along.

19:56.189 --> 19:57.222
What now?

19:57.307 --> 20:00.609
Zulu-November-Tango-1179--

20:00.676 --> 20:03.462
the director's access code.

20:03.529 --> 20:05.247
We could get fired.

20:05.315 --> 20:07.866
Your computer.

20:09.518 --> 20:11.503
(taps key)

20:13.289 --> 20:16.758
Hmm, looks like someone
got access to the Comescu

20:16.826 --> 20:18.143
family album.

20:18.211 --> 20:20.662
The captions are translated.

20:20.730 --> 20:25.617
"Vasile with Dracul and Ilena
on his birthday, 1987."

20:25.685 --> 20:29.154
"Ilena with Auntie Alexa
at the beach house."

20:30.723 --> 20:33.041
"Dracul, Vasile,
Ion, Alexa, and Ilena

20:33.092 --> 20:36.495
at Uncle Petru's,
January 2011."

20:36.562 --> 20:38.213
Look at Ilena's face--
it's completely

20:38.264 --> 20:39.831
out of focus.

20:39.899 --> 20:41.533
(typing)

20:42.819 --> 20:46.221
"Ilena's welcome
home party, 2009."

20:46.272 --> 20:48.173
Can you unblur them?

20:48.851 --> 20:49.968
Maybe.

20:50.019 --> 20:51.185
(typing)

20:51.270 --> 20:52.387
(shutter clicking)

20:57.559 --> 20:59.560
Here they come.

21:06.902 --> 21:08.920
DEEKS:
Female visitor.

21:09.905 --> 21:13.324
Why would the Comescus
blur her face?

21:14.994 --> 21:18.246
The blurring was done after it
was downloaded onto our server.

21:18.330 --> 21:19.931
The Comescus didn't do it.

21:19.999 --> 21:21.182
We did.

21:24.386 --> 21:26.004
That's a warm welcome,
little kissy-kissy.

21:26.055 --> 21:28.906
They've obviously
met before.

21:32.761 --> 21:34.429
That can't be.

21:41.904 --> 21:43.321
What? Who is it?

21:47.226 --> 21:49.327
It's Hunter.

22:00.666 --> 22:04.753
(beeping)

22:06.255 --> 22:07.622
Vance must have sent her.

22:07.673 --> 22:09.824
But how did she know
where to find them?

22:11.344 --> 22:13.044
She's got to
be undercover.

22:13.129 --> 22:15.547
Maybe it's not her first
time at the beach house.

22:15.631 --> 22:17.799
KENSI: Yeah, they've
clearly met before.

22:19.802 --> 22:20.769
She's undercover...

22:20.836 --> 22:22.854
she targets him,

22:22.939 --> 22:26.107
picks him up at a bar
or the gym...

22:26.175 --> 22:28.026
starts dating him.

22:28.110 --> 22:29.894
Gets invited home
to meet the family.

22:29.979 --> 22:31.980
That's what I'd do.

22:32.031 --> 22:34.699
What do <i>we</i> do?

22:34.784 --> 22:37.185
Having her in the house
changes the plan.

22:37.236 --> 22:38.987
We have a plan?

22:39.038 --> 22:41.072
Yeah.

22:41.157 --> 22:43.158
Kill 'em all.

23:09.185 --> 23:10.385
(beep)

23:11.270 --> 23:12.671
(speed-dialing)

23:12.738 --> 23:15.273
FEMALE VOICE: The mobile
customer you are trying to call

23:15.358 --> 23:17.242
is not available
or out of range.

23:17.326 --> 23:18.660
Please--
(beep)

23:21.530 --> 23:24.049
(sighs)

23:25.835 --> 23:28.253
We're going to have
to tell the director.

23:28.337 --> 23:30.255
What, that we illegally
used his password

23:30.339 --> 23:31.840
to access
an Eyes Only file?

23:31.907 --> 23:33.725
He must know
what's in the file.

23:33.793 --> 23:35.010
I wouldn't be so sure.

23:35.077 --> 23:36.411
I mean, Hetty had two files.

23:36.462 --> 23:37.745
Maybe she had more.

23:37.797 --> 23:40.048
Maybe she only showed him
what she needed him to know.

23:40.099 --> 23:42.100
What, like, a plausible
deniability kind of thing?

23:42.184 --> 23:45.220
More like a Hetty trying
to save her butt kind of thing.

23:45.271 --> 23:48.423
Okay, Eric, Hetty
doesn't work here anymore.

23:48.474 --> 23:50.442
Director Vance
is our boss now.

23:50.526 --> 23:53.878
And always has been.

23:53.946 --> 23:55.613
Director Vance.

23:55.698 --> 23:59.117
I thought Hetty had a rule
about eating in ops, Eric.

23:59.201 --> 24:00.402
Um, she does.

24:00.453 --> 24:02.237
She did.

24:02.288 --> 24:05.123
Do you have anything to report?

24:05.207 --> 24:06.458
Nothing.

24:06.542 --> 24:08.543
That can't wait.

24:11.247 --> 24:14.449
I need you to locate
an active GPS device.

24:14.500 --> 24:15.667
Who are we tracking?

24:15.751 --> 24:16.835
Agent Hunter.

24:16.919 --> 24:18.086
(coughing)

24:18.137 --> 24:19.387
Excellent.

24:21.724 --> 24:22.924
(blipping)

24:22.975 --> 24:24.259
ERIC:
Tracking GPS.

24:24.310 --> 24:25.860
Overlaying pictometry.

24:25.928 --> 24:28.913
All right, she's at
a beach house on the Black Sea.

24:28.981 --> 24:30.615
Or at least
her GPS tracker is.

24:30.683 --> 24:32.684
Who owns this beach house, Eric?

24:32.752 --> 24:34.018
ERIC:
Um...

24:34.086 --> 24:36.271
Property is owned

24:36.322 --> 24:38.923
by a company registered
in the Cayman Islands.

24:38.991 --> 24:40.892
CF&Q Limited.

24:40.960 --> 24:42.927
Three listed
directors--

24:42.995 --> 24:47.215
Alexa Comescu, Vasile
Comescu and Dracul Comescu.

24:47.283 --> 24:49.200
How do you say "bingo"
in Romanian?

24:49.268 --> 24:51.002
- Bingo.
- Bingo.

24:51.070 --> 24:53.388
In the camp of the enemy.

24:53.456 --> 24:55.774
How did she know to go there?

24:55.841 --> 25:00.211
That's a very good
question, Miss Jones.

25:00.296 --> 25:02.797
Almost as good as:
Why hasn't she called?

25:05.217 --> 25:07.668
KENSI: So, basically, those were
Callan's instructions.

25:07.720 --> 25:09.604
So that's the plan--
just kill them all?

25:09.671 --> 25:10.889
Yep.

25:10.973 --> 25:11.890
Mm-hmm. Has anyone
figured out exactly

25:11.974 --> 25:12.941
how we're going to do that?

25:13.008 --> 25:15.894
- No, not yet.
- Right, okay.

25:15.978 --> 25:17.979
Well, listen... I'm on
my third gelato here,

25:18.030 --> 25:19.347
and I'm beginning to wonder

25:19.398 --> 25:23.684
if my new wife has
up and dumped me, but...

25:23.736 --> 25:24.953
I think you mean sister.

25:25.020 --> 25:27.205
Okay, fine. My sister.

25:27.289 --> 25:28.856
Thank you.

25:28.908 --> 25:31.059
(gate opens, shuts)
And I was... Hold on.

25:32.378 --> 25:33.694
What's happening?

25:33.746 --> 25:34.862
Deeks?

25:34.914 --> 25:36.481
Hello?

25:36.549 --> 25:38.216
Okay, I'm starting to feel
exposed here.

25:38.300 --> 25:39.467
I think I'm going to move.

25:39.535 --> 25:41.102
I will, uh, I'll call you back.

25:42.505 --> 25:45.039
(phone beeps off)

25:45.090 --> 25:46.791
Deeks good?

25:46.859 --> 25:49.060
Yeah. Moving position.

25:50.446 --> 25:52.847
SAM: You see any
electronic security?

25:52.898 --> 25:54.732
Cameras? Sensors?

25:54.817 --> 25:56.518
Just lots of guards.

25:56.569 --> 25:59.387
A dozen on the grounds at least;
probably more inside.

26:00.389 --> 26:02.640
Going to have
to draw them out.

26:02.708 --> 26:05.210
Need a diversion.

26:08.113 --> 26:10.448
Oh, joy.

26:17.006 --> 26:19.123
(tires squealing
and horn honking)

26:29.001 --> 26:30.935
(speaking Romanian)

26:53.108 --> 26:54.192
(gasps)

26:56.962 --> 26:57.996
Really?

26:58.063 --> 26:59.831
Luka!

27:01.217 --> 27:02.734
I hate Romania!

27:02.801 --> 27:05.086
There's stairs up from
the beach here,

27:05.137 --> 27:08.006
but all the beach approaches
are heavily guarded, so...

27:08.090 --> 27:09.274
I got three prisoners.

27:09.341 --> 27:10.275
Where?

27:10.342 --> 27:11.509
Right behind me.

27:26.408 --> 27:28.326
Okay, make that one prisoner

27:28.410 --> 27:29.611
and two dead guys.

27:29.662 --> 27:32.497
Over!
(speaking Romanian)

27:32.581 --> 27:33.814
(groans)

27:33.866 --> 27:36.117
You got made?

27:36.168 --> 27:37.835
I didn't get made.

27:37.920 --> 27:38.953
you definitely got made.

27:39.004 --> 27:40.355
Not because of anything
that I did.

27:40.422 --> 27:41.656
One gelato too many.

27:41.707 --> 27:45.376
Dracul Nicolae Comescu.

27:47.546 --> 27:50.665
Well, I definitely
didn't get made.

27:50.716 --> 27:53.635
They knew who to look for.

27:53.686 --> 27:57.105
Looks like somebody knew
we were coming.

28:11.934 --> 28:13.885
DEEKS: This narrows
down our options.

28:13.936 --> 28:15.604
KENSI: We get within
a hundred feet of that place,

28:15.605 --> 28:17.139
we're compromised.

28:17.190 --> 28:19.408
And we still don't know
if Hetty's even there.

28:19.475 --> 28:21.643
Think they got a chance
to call it in?

28:21.694 --> 28:23.028
I didn't wait around
to find out.

28:23.113 --> 28:24.496
As soon as I got made--

28:24.581 --> 28:26.949
spotted-- I took off.

28:27.000 --> 28:31.420
They were snapping
at my heels. Maybe not.

28:31.487 --> 28:33.255
We need to move
before they miss these guys.

28:33.322 --> 28:35.591
What about Hunter?
There's no photo of her.

28:35.658 --> 28:38.577
SAM: We got to assume
her cover's still intact.

28:38.645 --> 28:40.345
What cover
might that be?

28:43.516 --> 28:44.550
Who is she?

28:48.838 --> 28:50.856
It's a good-looking
woman, Sam.

28:50.940 --> 28:52.524
You think she's
his girlfriend?

28:52.609 --> 28:55.343
A woman like that wants a man
with power and money.

28:55.395 --> 28:58.230
You got power
and money, Dracul?

28:59.816 --> 29:01.617
SAM:
Didn't think so.

29:01.684 --> 29:03.068
He's just tenth-rate muscle,

29:03.153 --> 29:05.654
20 times removed from
the head of the family.

29:05.705 --> 29:07.623
CALLEN:
How about this one:

29:07.690 --> 29:10.375
What's her name?

29:12.879 --> 29:17.382
Why don't you knock on the door
and ask her yourself.

29:17.467 --> 29:19.384
Right answer.

29:19.469 --> 29:21.470
We just might do that.

29:23.673 --> 29:28.477
What do you know
of the boy on the beach?

29:28.544 --> 29:32.064
His time should have
ended with his mother.

29:32.148 --> 29:34.883
This was a mistake.

29:34.934 --> 29:38.020
Instead, he grew into a man.

29:38.071 --> 29:41.673
You know a lot about him then.

29:41.741 --> 29:43.659
More than you.

29:43.726 --> 29:47.746
More than he knows
about himself.

29:47.830 --> 29:49.598
Who he is.

29:49.666 --> 29:54.236
From where he comes.

29:54.287 --> 29:59.024
He was given his grandfather's
name-- Callen.

29:59.092 --> 30:00.759
Yes.

30:01.761 --> 30:04.596
What about his first name?

30:04.681 --> 30:07.299
You know what it is?

30:16.392 --> 30:19.645
What is this thing you did
that was so bad

30:19.729 --> 30:24.616
that you must come to my house
and die to make your amends?

30:33.076 --> 30:35.577
It's not what I did.

30:37.747 --> 30:40.666
It's what I didn't do.

30:43.400 --> 30:45.451
What I couldn't do.

30:49.055 --> 30:51.440
Save her.

30:54.833 --> 30:56.836
Save his mother.

30:59.034 --> 31:01.302
And we are on stream.

31:01.370 --> 31:03.654
ERIC: Ready to track
Hunter's cell phone.

31:03.722 --> 31:05.406
VANCE: Colonel, thank you
for making this happen.

31:05.490 --> 31:06.357
COLONEL:
Take care.

31:06.408 --> 31:07.992
Yes, you, too.

31:08.043 --> 31:09.710
Low orbit, oblique angles--

31:09.795 --> 31:11.412
so coverage could be
a little scratchy.

31:11.496 --> 31:12.797
What's our window, Eric?

31:12.864 --> 31:14.382
We've tasked
a small target area,

31:14.466 --> 31:17.168
only two square miles, so our
window's less than 15 seconds,

31:17.219 --> 31:18.135
starting in ten.

31:18.203 --> 31:19.536
Big screen, Eric.

31:19.588 --> 31:23.657
And we are
capturing data.

31:23.725 --> 31:25.826
(beeping)

31:25.894 --> 31:29.397
Every pinpoint of light is an
active GPS cell phone.

31:29.464 --> 31:31.432
Romanians love
their cell phones.

31:31.516 --> 31:35.669
Data capture terminating
in three, two, one.

31:35.737 --> 31:36.854
And the show's over.

31:36.905 --> 31:39.106
We got it, I hope.

31:39.191 --> 31:41.275
Just need to overlay it
with our satellite imagery

31:41.360 --> 31:42.927
and we are good to snoop.

31:42.994 --> 31:45.229
Okay.

31:45.280 --> 31:48.916
Let's see.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.118
Agent Hunter's cell phone.

31:51.203 --> 31:52.703
Now for the fun part.

31:52.754 --> 31:55.923
Let's start with all calls
over the last 24 hours

31:56.007 --> 31:58.325
and check for callbacks.

31:58.393 --> 32:00.611
And we have a winner.

32:00.679 --> 32:02.263
Three calls to the same number.

32:02.330 --> 32:03.664
Looks like a cell phone

32:03.732 --> 32:05.933
registered to the same
Comescu family company

32:06.017 --> 32:08.085
that owns the beach house.

32:08.136 --> 32:10.187
Local search, Eric.

32:14.759 --> 32:16.444
Got it.

32:16.528 --> 32:18.396
The cell phone's just
a couple blocks

32:18.447 --> 32:19.763
from Hunter's
current location.

32:19.815 --> 32:22.783
Not residential.

32:22.868 --> 32:24.819
Guessing a light
industrial area.

32:24.903 --> 32:26.203
Business is bad.

32:26.271 --> 32:28.239
Hardly any active cell phones.

32:28.306 --> 32:31.292
Although four are in
the same building as our guy.

32:31.376 --> 32:33.411
ERIC: Whoever he is,
he's got company.

32:33.462 --> 32:35.246
Huh... the four
numbers are sequential.

32:35.297 --> 32:37.231
Means they were bought
at the same time.

32:37.299 --> 32:38.282
Burn phones.

32:38.333 --> 32:39.950
Bought where, Eric?

32:42.620 --> 32:44.405
Prague Airport yesterday.

32:44.473 --> 32:46.290
I think we just
found Callen.

32:46.341 --> 32:47.791
Or their cell phones.

32:47.843 --> 32:50.060
Well, they're all in
close proximity.

32:50.128 --> 32:51.462
I'm guessing same room.

32:51.513 --> 32:54.181
Which means they could have
one of the Comescus.

32:54.266 --> 32:55.900
Or Comescu could
have all of them.

32:55.967 --> 32:57.518
Text message, Eric.

32:57.602 --> 32:58.769
Who to?

32:58.820 --> 33:00.087
All four of them.

33:00.155 --> 33:02.740
Maybe one of them will answer.

33:07.129 --> 33:09.296
So what do you want
to do with him?

33:14.035 --> 33:15.819
We could tie him up,

33:15.871 --> 33:18.339
call an ambulance,
once we're clear

33:18.423 --> 33:20.374
of the beach house.

33:21.426 --> 33:23.961
Or do you have
something else in mind?

33:25.430 --> 33:26.764
Your call.

33:26.831 --> 33:28.382
DEEKS:
I found something.

33:31.052 --> 33:33.304
It's in his address book.

33:40.729 --> 33:42.496
Tell me about Ilena.

33:44.282 --> 33:46.367
She's not the woman
you should fear.

33:46.451 --> 33:47.684
You still want to be breathing
when you walk

33:47.736 --> 33:48.969
out of here,
you tell me about her.

33:49.037 --> 33:51.372
- You think she's my girlfriend?
- Tell me!

33:54.376 --> 33:56.877
I've known her all my life.

33:58.380 --> 34:00.664
We played together
when we were children.

34:01.699 --> 34:05.753
Ilena is my cousin.

34:08.039 --> 34:09.139
(cell phones chirping)

34:09.206 --> 34:10.658
DEEKS: Oh, I'm so
not expecting

34:10.725 --> 34:12.676
a phone call.

34:14.545 --> 34:16.030
They found us.

34:17.565 --> 34:18.649
Eric's good.

34:18.716 --> 34:21.402
Eric and Nell are good.

34:30.661 --> 34:32.246
(ringing)

34:32.330 --> 34:33.330
This is Eric.

34:33.398 --> 34:34.331
It's Callen.

34:34.399 --> 34:35.748
Uh, hold for Director Vance.

34:35.833 --> 34:37.734
It's Callen.

34:37.786 --> 34:40.588
You're a long way from home,
Agent Callen.

34:40.672 --> 34:41.839
(chuckles)

34:41.906 --> 34:43.090
Well, a couple
of days ago,

34:43.174 --> 34:44.542
I would have agreed
with you.

34:44.592 --> 34:46.193
Right now, I'm not so sure.

34:46.261 --> 34:47.293
Is your team okay?

34:47.362 --> 34:48.512
Not my team.

34:48.580 --> 34:49.980
Hetty's team, then.

34:50.047 --> 34:51.098
We're fine.

34:51.181 --> 34:52.533
Have you found her?

34:52.601 --> 34:55.135
She's in a beach house a couple
blocks from where we are.

34:55.219 --> 34:56.353
I see.

34:56.420 --> 34:57.471
Anything else?

34:57.556 --> 34:59.223
They knew we were coming.

34:59.274 --> 35:02.876
They've been tracking us
since we landed in Prague.

35:02.944 --> 35:05.663
Have you heard the name,
Ilena Vadim?

35:06.698 --> 35:08.765
No, I haven't,

35:08.817 --> 35:12.903
but it appears that Eric
and Miss Jones have.

35:14.772 --> 35:16.707
There were two
Comescu files

35:16.774 --> 35:18.242
on the server.

35:18.293 --> 35:19.960
(typing)

35:21.263 --> 35:23.063
Ilena's face
had been blurred out.

35:23.131 --> 35:25.282
Eric unblurred it.

35:25.350 --> 35:28.569
NELL: Ilena Vadim and
Agent Hunter appear to be

35:28.637 --> 35:31.055
the same person.

35:31.122 --> 35:33.891
Agent Hunter has been
gathering intel in Romania

35:33.958 --> 35:36.660
on the Comescu case
for the past three months.

35:36.728 --> 35:39.413
But some of the photos go back
further than three months.

35:39.481 --> 35:40.814
How much further?

35:40.899 --> 35:42.232
At least two years.

35:42.300 --> 35:44.318
Some to when she
was a little girl.

35:44.402 --> 35:47.655
The photo captions suggest
she's one of the family.

35:47.739 --> 35:51.275
CALLEN: Cousins,
according to Dracul Comescu.

35:51.326 --> 35:53.827
And you believe him, Callen?

35:53.912 --> 35:56.113
He has no reason to lie.

35:56.164 --> 36:00.000
Somebody told them
we were coming.

36:00.085 --> 36:02.519
The Comescus are in
the human traffic business.

36:02.587 --> 36:05.656
They pay corrupt officials
to keep them informed.

36:05.707 --> 36:08.175
Okay, well, that
is one explanation.

36:08.259 --> 36:10.678
I don't want to believe the
other explanation, Agent Callen.

36:10.762 --> 36:12.112
(phone ringing)

36:12.180 --> 36:14.782
Incoming call-- Comescu's phone.

36:19.354 --> 36:20.821
ERIC:
It's Hunter.

36:34.478 --> 36:36.846
(ringing)

36:41.685 --> 36:43.569
He's with me.

36:44.186 --> 36:45.603
Callen.

36:45.655 --> 36:47.322
You're here already.

36:48.774 --> 36:51.259
Dracul couldn't make it
to the phone.

36:51.327 --> 36:52.527
He's dead?

36:55.531 --> 36:57.282
Bleeding.

36:58.868 --> 37:00.651
Where are you?

37:00.703 --> 37:04.272
CALLEN: Close enough to see you
arrive at the beach house.

37:04.340 --> 37:05.990
Hetty?

37:06.042 --> 37:07.825
I haven't seen her yet.

37:07.877 --> 37:10.578
But they're keeping her alive
to flush you out.

37:10.646 --> 37:12.380
Well, it's working.

37:12.465 --> 37:15.266
How do you want to do this?

37:15.334 --> 37:18.019
I am open to suggestions.

37:19.588 --> 37:21.356
Tell me where you are.

37:26.479 --> 37:28.530
An old auto workshop.

37:28.614 --> 37:30.782
Two blocks off Main Street,
one block south.

37:30.849 --> 37:32.967
There's a broken
gas pump in front.

37:35.204 --> 37:36.354
Give me ten minutes.

37:36.422 --> 37:39.190
Ten minutes.

37:39.241 --> 37:41.493
(phone beeps off,
tosses phone down)

37:41.544 --> 37:42.811
Get that?

37:42.878 --> 37:46.531
Agent Callen,
do you have a plan?

37:46.582 --> 37:47.749
(chuckles)

37:47.833 --> 37:49.984
I gave up being an agent
when I turned in my badge.

37:50.052 --> 37:52.003
You didn't turn in your badge.

37:52.054 --> 37:53.704
You mistakenly left it
on Hetty's desk.

37:53.756 --> 37:55.673
I put it in her drawer
for safekeeping.

37:55.725 --> 37:57.826
Do you have a plan?

37:57.893 --> 37:59.744
Yeah.

37:59.812 --> 38:01.212
Enlighten me.

38:01.263 --> 38:03.214
Save Hetty.

38:03.265 --> 38:05.700
Carry on, Agent Callen.

38:06.986 --> 38:09.404
Hunter's on our side.

38:09.488 --> 38:12.357
I mean, she has to be, right?

38:17.163 --> 38:20.882
So... you knew his mother.

38:23.619 --> 38:25.937
Yes.

38:26.956 --> 38:28.790
Tell me...

38:33.579 --> 38:35.580
(knock at door)

39:19.692 --> 39:21.476
Ilena was taken away
by her father

39:21.560 --> 39:23.478
after her mother died.

39:23.562 --> 39:26.815
Two years ago,
she came back to us.

39:26.899 --> 39:28.249
Came back to you?

39:28.317 --> 39:30.351
She's my niece.

39:36.192 --> 39:39.160
(engine revving,
tires squealing)

39:42.698 --> 39:45.433
SAM: Kensi, Deeks,
go, go, go.

39:45.501 --> 39:46.817
I counted 12.

39:46.869 --> 39:48.086
Evens up the odds.

39:48.153 --> 39:50.421
Only until they discover
we've gone.

39:50.489 --> 39:51.873
- You see Hunter?
- Nope.

39:58.097 --> 39:59.631
(men shouting,
gunfire in distance)

40:12.194 --> 40:13.478
(gun fires twice)

40:27.192 --> 40:28.209
On your right!

40:58.890 --> 40:59.941
Hetty.

41:01.327 --> 41:02.560
(gasps quietly)

41:02.611 --> 41:04.078
I know who you are.

41:04.163 --> 41:05.830
I know your family.

41:05.898 --> 41:09.550
I know everything about you.

41:23.349 --> 41:25.783
When did you trust me?

41:25.851 --> 41:28.269
Not until
you pulled the trigger.

41:28.354 --> 41:29.771
You're good?

41:29.855 --> 41:30.888
Mm.

41:30.940 --> 41:32.023
CALLEN:
You didn't play

41:32.090 --> 41:33.474
with Dracul when
you were kids.

41:33.559 --> 41:36.110
That would be
his real cousin, Ilena,

41:36.195 --> 41:37.445
who's happily married
in Argentina

41:37.529 --> 41:39.814
and wants nothing to do
with her family.

41:41.817 --> 41:43.234
And you came back as Ilena.

41:43.285 --> 41:44.535
They wanted
to believe their niece

41:44.603 --> 41:46.287
would come back
to them one day.

41:46.372 --> 41:48.439
But why you?

41:48.490 --> 41:50.491
For what?

41:53.545 --> 41:55.063
This.

42:00.302 --> 42:02.119
- We good?
- We're good.

42:02.171 --> 42:04.172
Hetty, time to hustle.

42:04.256 --> 42:06.457
Deeks and Kensi are at the car.

42:10.129 --> 42:12.180
Hetty?

42:15.067 --> 42:16.934
(groans quietly)

42:20.906 --> 42:22.907
CALLEN:
Hetty?

42:26.661 --> 42:28.579
