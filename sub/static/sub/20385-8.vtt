04:14.755 --> 04:15.956
Get off of me.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.350
(spits)

04:42.383 --> 04:44.452
(music playing
on radio indistinctly)

04:46.520 --> 04:50.257
* Tis the season to be jolly

04:50.290 --> 04:51.592
* Fa la la la la
La la la la *

04:51.625 --> 04:53.026
Jesus.

04:54.227 --> 04:57.931
* Don we now our gay apparel

04:57.965 --> 05:02.102

05:16.750 --> 05:18.151
* Fa la la, la la la,
La la la *

05:18.185 --> 05:19.987
Oh, shit! Take a look behind us,
there.

05:20.854 --> 05:22.289
They're following us.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.524
Crap.

05:24.224 --> 05:25.493
Crap.

05:26.259 --> 05:28.529
Oh my God. (whimpers)

05:28.562 --> 05:31.298
-Fudge me!
-(whimpers)

05:31.331 --> 05:33.333
(song starts fading)

05:35.769 --> 05:37.170

05:40.408 --> 05:41.609
(Nikki grunting)

05:44.512 --> 05:45.679
(Nikki grunts softly)

05:45.713 --> 05:47.214
NIKKI: Hey...

05:47.247 --> 05:48.849
Hey.

05:48.882 --> 05:51.752
What's the plan?
Are you just... (grunts)

05:51.785 --> 05:53.487
Where are we going?

05:53.521 --> 05:54.922
(panting)

05:57.391 --> 05:58.692
What?

05:59.893 --> 06:01.361
Is that...

06:02.730 --> 06:04.798
You speak with sign language?

06:06.967 --> 06:09.002
Are you kidding me?

06:09.036 --> 06:10.438
How are we supposed...

06:10.471 --> 06:12.773
(sighs)
Chained to a deaf guy.

06:12.806 --> 06:15.809
-Jesus.
-(wolves howling)

06:24.652 --> 06:26.420
We need to cut this.

06:32.225 --> 06:33.827
(grunting)

06:38.566 --> 06:39.833
(grunts)

06:41.635 --> 06:42.736
(grunts)

06:44.337 --> 06:45.439

07:05.325 --> 07:06.927
(panting)

07:29.349 --> 07:30.951
(birds chirping)

08:04.818 --> 08:06.820
NIKKI: We were headed north,
towards Watab.

08:06.854 --> 08:09.322
Maybe 40 minutes on the bus.
Maybe longer.

08:09.356 --> 08:11.291
I think I fell asleep.

08:11.324 --> 08:12.693
(panting)

08:13.527 --> 08:15.162
A river nearby...

08:16.196 --> 08:18.498
The Mississippi, I'm guessing.

08:18.532 --> 08:19.733
Hey.

08:20.233 --> 08:21.535
Hey!

08:22.836 --> 08:24.337
We need a plan.

08:25.505 --> 08:26.774
A plan!

09:03.744 --> 09:05.445
YURI: I knew a Helga once.

09:07.214 --> 09:10.283
All she do...
Talk, talk, talk.

09:15.222 --> 09:16.356
(grunts)

09:16.389 --> 09:17.791
(grunts)

09:17.825 --> 09:20.661
MAN: Whoo-ee!
Good shooting, son!

09:28.602 --> 09:30.470
BOY: I think I got him.

09:32.272 --> 09:34.407
(suspenseful music playing)

09:40.748 --> 09:42.349
(breathing heavily)

10:05.806 --> 10:07.207
NIKKI: (echoing) Ray...

10:16.149 --> 10:18.986
I thought I could tough it out
but I guess I'm a wimp.

10:20.453 --> 10:21.789
RAY: Baby, please.

10:30.463 --> 10:31.665
NIKKI: Baby...

10:36.970 --> 10:38.939
(music playing)

10:38.972 --> 10:41.641
Tell me you brought
the getaway money.

10:51.819 --> 10:52.820
Baby?

10:55.055 --> 10:58.992
RAY: (stutters) It's just...
It happened so fast.

11:04.031 --> 11:05.966
NIKKI: Ray,
we need that money.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.801
(panting)

11:07.835 --> 11:09.202
RAY: I know.

11:16.877 --> 11:18.445
I know. I'm going.

11:19.446 --> 11:20.914
NIKKI: Ray...

11:23.350 --> 11:25.018
You want me to go?

11:27.755 --> 11:29.422
RAY: No. I'm fine.

11:37.865 --> 11:39.199
I got it.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.258
(breathing heavily)

12:23.010 --> 12:25.412
(wolves howling)

12:48.802 --> 12:50.270
(grunts)

12:54.274 --> 12:55.608
(both grunt)

12:56.276 --> 12:57.277
Put your back in it.

13:00.147 --> 13:02.315
(screams)

13:02.349 --> 13:04.017
-Okay. Okay. Get down.
-(continues screaming)

13:04.051 --> 13:05.853
Get down. Get down.

13:05.886 --> 13:07.955
(screaming subsides)

13:12.893 --> 13:14.761
(bow twangs)

13:14.794 --> 13:16.729
-(both whimpering)
-(arrow thuds)

13:28.075 --> 13:29.943
(both screaming)

13:29.977 --> 13:31.578
No! (panting)

13:32.980 --> 13:35.148
Duck. Duck. Duck. Duck.

13:36.516 --> 13:38.585
Okay. Okay.

13:40.087 --> 13:42.689
One, two, three.

13:43.991 --> 13:45.825
-(arrow thuds)
-(screaming)

13:46.559 --> 13:48.595
(both grunting)

13:51.431 --> 13:53.000
(panting)

13:56.904 --> 13:57.938
(Nikki grunts)

13:59.506 --> 14:00.840
(grunting)

14:01.774 --> 14:03.210
(screaming)

14:08.415 --> 14:09.616
THE GOLEM: You bitch!

14:10.350 --> 14:11.684

14:14.187 --> 14:15.688
-(squelching)

(groans)

14:53.493 --> 14:55.162
-(whimpers)
-(grunts)

14:57.730 --> 14:59.199
No. No way.

14:59.232 --> 15:00.733
No. No.

15:01.401 --> 15:02.635
(grunts)

15:04.071 --> 15:06.239
(whimpering)

15:06.273 --> 15:08.508

15:32.932 --> 15:34.667
(both grunting)

15:44.377 --> 15:46.479
(both breathing heavily)

16:11.171 --> 16:13.206
(Nikki breathing heavily)

16:19.579 --> 16:21.048
(both grunting)

17:26.045 --> 17:27.046
(sighs)

17:38.225 --> 17:39.326
(sighs)

17:44.231 --> 17:45.898
MAN: You want shoes?

17:47.567 --> 17:48.835
What?

17:50.237 --> 17:51.438
Shoes.

17:53.240 --> 17:54.407
No.

17:55.074 --> 17:56.609
Just whiskey.

17:57.744 --> 17:59.246
Make it a double.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.648
And one for my friend.

18:07.420 --> 18:09.489
(bartender pouring drinks)

18:24.271 --> 18:26.239
Yeah. Just this much.

18:26.273 --> 18:27.374
Sherry.

18:35.615 --> 18:36.949
Shartis?

18:39.452 --> 18:41.654
Huh?

18:41.688 --> 18:45.692
"Job sat on his dung heap,
covered in boils."

18:48.528 --> 18:51.264
-Mister, it's been a long day.
-Ah!

18:51.298 --> 18:53.266
They're all long.

18:53.300 --> 18:55.468
That's the nature
of existence.

18:56.135 --> 18:58.838
Life is suffering.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.975
I think you're beginning
to understand that.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.144
Hmm?

19:06.145 --> 19:07.514
-Amen.
-(chuckles)

19:08.548 --> 19:10.417
Can I show you something?

19:16.323 --> 19:17.724
(meowing)

19:19.158 --> 19:20.227
Aw...

19:22.094 --> 19:23.095
(meows)

19:26.098 --> 19:27.166
Ray is the cat.

19:28.568 --> 19:30.203
What?

19:30.237 --> 19:32.305
His name... I call him Ray.

19:32.339 --> 19:34.173
I know, I know. That's not
really a cat's name,

19:34.207 --> 19:36.476
but when I looked at him,
that was the name that stuck.

19:36.509 --> 19:38.945
But this is how it is,
I think.

19:41.948 --> 19:43.750
Are you familiar
with Ghuilgul?

19:44.551 --> 19:45.852
It's Hebrew.

19:47.119 --> 19:49.889
It's a word that describes
how an old soul

19:49.922 --> 19:52.259
attaches itself to a new body.

19:56.529 --> 19:57.697
(meows)

20:00.767 --> 20:02.134
-Ray?
-(meows)

20:04.371 --> 20:05.938
Is that you?

20:05.972 --> 20:07.607
Uh-huh.

20:07.640 --> 20:11.411
Unfortunately, some souls
cannot find a body to enter.

20:11.444 --> 20:13.680
And they become lost.

20:13.713 --> 20:15.548
Rabbi Nachman believed

20:15.582 --> 20:18.518
the Jewish victims
of the massacre of Uman

20:18.551 --> 20:20.453
were lost souls.

20:20.487 --> 20:23.222
1768 in Ukraine,

20:23.256 --> 20:25.392
untold thousands
killed by the Cossack.

20:25.425 --> 20:26.526
Women and children...

20:26.559 --> 20:29.562
Their bodies dumped in a hole

20:29.596 --> 20:30.897
and forgotten.

20:32.832 --> 20:36.536
When Rabbi Nachman
first visited Uman,

20:36.569 --> 20:41.508
he saw the mass grave,
and he called it a garden.

20:43.810 --> 20:45.044
He told his followers

20:45.077 --> 20:47.580
that he wanted
to be buried there.

20:47.614 --> 20:49.749
The master of the field.

20:51.318 --> 20:56.589
His soul, he said,
would bind and comfort theirs.

21:00.627 --> 21:02.329
(sighs)

21:02.362 --> 21:04.664
Have you been
to this place before?

21:07.600 --> 21:09.101
The bowling alley?

21:09.836 --> 21:11.671
Is that what you see?

21:18.845 --> 21:19.879
Oh...

21:21.681 --> 21:23.115
(chuckles)

21:24.484 --> 21:25.652
Cheers.

21:29.889 --> 21:31.424
(sighs) Oh...

21:31.458 --> 21:33.760
(inhales) Hits the spot.

21:33.793 --> 21:34.861
(chuckles)

21:36.796 --> 21:38.865
We all end up here eventually.

21:40.032 --> 21:42.301
To be weighed and judged.

21:42.335 --> 21:45.372
As it is now
for you and your friend.

21:45.405 --> 21:47.640
You know, some thought that
he should stay behind,

21:47.674 --> 21:51.177
but I convinced them that
he was on a better path now.

21:53.145 --> 21:54.814
And you...

21:54.847 --> 21:56.182
What about me?

21:56.215 --> 21:58.250
(speaking Hebrew)

22:00.186 --> 22:01.354
I don't...

22:01.388 --> 22:04.457
"Who will rise for me
against the wicked?"

22:04.491 --> 22:07.394
Who will take a stand
against evildoers?

22:09.929 --> 22:11.097
You need a ride?

22:12.999 --> 22:14.901
-Uh...
-There's a car out front.

22:14.934 --> 22:18.371
It's a green
Volkswagen Beetle.

22:18.405 --> 22:21.340
This is the universe
at its most ironic.

22:21.374 --> 22:25.311
Don't worry. Its sins
have been swept clean.

22:25.344 --> 22:27.814
You and your friend
should take it.

22:27.847 --> 22:29.449
The keys are under the mat.

22:30.282 --> 22:31.584
I...

22:32.719 --> 22:35.087
-Thank you.
-Oh, don't thank me.

22:36.956 --> 22:40.627
Simply deliver a message
when the time comes.

22:41.928 --> 22:43.696
A message?

22:43.730 --> 22:45.865
-To who?
-To the wicked.

22:47.033 --> 22:49.001
Tell them...

22:49.035 --> 22:53.072
"Though thou exalt thyself
like the eagle,

22:54.206 --> 22:58.177
"though thou make thy nest
among the stars,

22:58.210 --> 23:00.279
"thence will
I bring thee down,

23:00.312 --> 23:01.814
"sayeth the Lord."

23:04.050 --> 23:07.587
"Though thou exalt thyself..."

23:07.620 --> 23:09.388
(chuckles)
It's okay. It's okay.

23:09.989 --> 23:11.758
You'll remember.

23:11.791 --> 23:13.159
(chuckles)

23:20.600 --> 23:21.968
Ray...

23:24.804 --> 23:27.406
I'm afraid you have to
leave the cat.

23:32.144 --> 23:33.145
(meows)

23:38.585 --> 23:39.919
(softly) It's okay.

23:39.952 --> 23:41.387
(meows)

23:41.420 --> 23:42.589
Don't worry.

23:48.528 --> 23:50.162
Hey, do me a favor, will you?

23:50.196 --> 23:51.263
Mmm.

23:51.297 --> 23:53.800
When the Gophers play,

23:53.833 --> 23:55.167
put a little beer in a bowl

23:55.201 --> 23:57.136
and put it
in front of the game.

23:57.169 --> 23:58.838
-(meows)
-(chuckles)

23:58.871 --> 24:00.773
(speaking Hebrew)

24:02.642 --> 24:03.876
(meowing)

24:26.733 --> 24:27.900
(engine starts)

24:42.715 --> 24:44.316
(breathing heavily)

24:58.998 --> 25:01.000
(breathing heavily)

25:09.075 --> 25:10.076
(sniffles)

25:11.678 --> 25:12.879
Napkins.

25:17.183 --> 25:18.718
And some vodka.

25:23.556 --> 25:25.224
(bartender pouring drink)

25:35.768 --> 25:37.203
Yuri...

25:40.206 --> 25:41.574
(speaking Russian)

25:41.608 --> 25:46.178
You are Yuri Gurka,
Cossack of the plains.

25:46.212 --> 25:49.348
Grandchild
of the Wolves' Hundred.

25:49.381 --> 25:50.850
I have a message for you

25:50.883 --> 25:54.821
from Helga Albrecht
and the Rabbi Nachman.

26:03.062 --> 26:04.764
(breathing heavily)

26:06.398 --> 26:08.801
(ominous music playing)

26:27.286 --> 26:29.355
(music playing over radio)

26:33.926 --> 26:35.728
Socks.

26:35.762 --> 26:37.263
-Great.
-(chuckles)

26:38.097 --> 26:41.668
I... I needed socks, thanks.

26:41.701 --> 26:43.836
Don't thank us, thank Santa.

26:47.339 --> 26:50.542
I should, um,
go check on the ragout.

26:51.477 --> 26:52.945
Let me help you.

27:04.523 --> 27:06.759
Are you having
a good Christmas?

27:06.793 --> 27:08.695
Oh... You know...

27:08.728 --> 27:10.529
Kinda weird.

27:10.562 --> 27:13.565
I know, we'll figure it out.

27:15.567 --> 27:17.069
(cell phone vibrates)

27:18.637 --> 27:19.638
Hmm.

27:20.339 --> 27:21.540
Burgle.

27:23.976 --> 27:25.444
Oh, jeez.

27:25.477 --> 27:27.413
(indistinct radio chatter)

27:58.677 --> 28:00.412
(indistinct chattering)

28:02.348 --> 28:04.016
(dog barking)

28:05.051 --> 28:06.252
(siren wails)

28:07.954 --> 28:09.421
-Sir.
-Not now.

28:09.455 --> 28:10.990
Gloria Burgle.
Eden Valley police.

28:11.023 --> 28:13.225
You had one of mine
on the bus. Nikki Swango?

28:13.259 --> 28:14.593
We're still doing
a head count.

28:14.626 --> 28:15.762
There's some dead
from the crash,

28:15.795 --> 28:18.597
-others from the assault.
-Assault?

28:18.630 --> 28:20.767
We count three sets of
boot prints on the approach.

28:20.800 --> 28:23.002
We got a stolen crotch rocket
in the trees.

28:23.035 --> 28:25.104
Plus some kind of
homemade ramp

28:25.137 --> 28:27.073
we think caused the upend.

28:27.106 --> 28:28.507
You saw the vehicle
on the way in?

28:28.540 --> 28:30.209
The yellow deal
flipped on its top?

28:30.242 --> 28:31.377
Couple of bystanders

28:31.410 --> 28:32.678
probably slowed
to do the Christian thing,

28:32.711 --> 28:35.514
then recognized the debacle
for what it was.

28:35.547 --> 28:37.349
Second vehicle,
panel van maybe,

28:37.383 --> 28:38.951
chases them for 2 miles,

28:38.985 --> 28:40.186
runs them off the road,

28:40.219 --> 28:41.854
finishes the couple
execution style.

28:41.888 --> 28:43.222
Jeez.

28:43.255 --> 28:45.191
If I could just get
a look inside the bus,

28:45.224 --> 28:47.626
my suspect,
well, she's real memorable.

28:47.659 --> 28:48.861
A woman, you said?

28:48.895 --> 28:51.197
No women on the bus,
I can tell you that.

28:51.230 --> 28:52.564
Anything I can...

28:52.598 --> 28:55.534
That patch on your coat,
does it say "US Marshal"?

28:55.567 --> 28:56.969
-No, sir.
-Well then,

28:57.003 --> 28:59.939
we'll call you
when we find out, either way.

28:59.972 --> 29:02.708
-Either?
-Dead or Alive.

29:02.741 --> 29:04.743
(indistinct radio chatter)

29:09.849 --> 29:11.250
(indistinct conversations)

29:15.187 --> 29:16.488
(doorbell rings)

29:20.492 --> 29:24.330
Yeah, is he home?
We got a meeting.

29:24.363 --> 29:26.098
(music playing on headphones)

29:28.935 --> 29:30.336
(bells jingling)

29:30.369 --> 29:31.703
What the heck?

29:38.044 --> 29:39.578
Sy, come in.

29:39.611 --> 29:41.280
We're just having lunch,
mind you.

29:41.313 --> 29:44.817
Where's Emmit? I tried
calling yesterday, but...

29:44.851 --> 29:48.254
He's resting. He's upstairs.

29:48.287 --> 29:49.956
All this bother
with his brother,

29:49.989 --> 29:51.690
he's very upset.

29:51.723 --> 29:53.759
I know, I was there.

29:53.792 --> 29:55.294
So, if he's...

29:59.631 --> 30:01.934
Can you get him?

30:01.968 --> 30:03.435
Like I told your man,
the police asked us

30:03.469 --> 30:05.604
to come down to the precinct,
give a statement.

30:05.637 --> 30:08.440
Yeah.
That's all taken care of.

30:08.474 --> 30:12.244
-What? When?
-Just come and take a seat.

30:13.145 --> 30:14.146
Please.

30:16.215 --> 30:19.318
In fact,
there's some very good news.

30:20.419 --> 30:22.454
-Good news?
-Yes.

30:22.488 --> 30:24.623
Today, you are
$5 million richer

30:24.656 --> 30:26.392
than you were yesterday.

30:28.360 --> 30:30.496
-What?
-Year-end bonuses.

30:32.164 --> 30:33.299
We already...

30:33.332 --> 30:35.134
Round two.
There is a round three,

30:35.167 --> 30:37.136
but I thought it better
to hold it

30:37.169 --> 30:38.837
till the next fiscal year.

30:38.871 --> 30:40.206
Sweet potato?

30:41.240 --> 30:42.241
Uh... No.

30:43.675 --> 30:46.045
I'm... I'm not very hungry.

30:46.078 --> 30:47.813
VARGA: No, no.
It would be a shame

30:47.846 --> 30:50.016
to let it all go to waste.

30:50.049 --> 30:52.418
Think of all them
starving children.

30:53.719 --> 30:54.887
No?

30:55.787 --> 30:58.157
What about some tea then, eh?

30:58.190 --> 30:59.858
Fancy a nice cuppa?

30:59.892 --> 31:02.161
Sure. Good Christ.

31:02.194 --> 31:03.362
-Sugar?
-No. I...

31:03.395 --> 31:04.863
That's fine.

31:07.266 --> 31:09.835
It was me mum's recipe,

31:09.868 --> 31:13.539
the secret of which
she smuggled beneath her bosom

31:13.572 --> 31:16.208
all the way
from Wales to Bristol.

31:25.551 --> 31:27.353
-It's a little bitter.
-Yeah.

31:27.386 --> 31:31.090
Well, try some more,
I think you'll find
it smooths out nicely.

31:32.658 --> 31:33.993
(slurping)

31:50.342 --> 31:53.079
Right, well, I'll tell
the big man you stopped by,

31:53.112 --> 31:55.314
and don't worry about all this
trouble with the police.

31:55.347 --> 31:56.648
I think you'll find
these things

31:56.682 --> 31:59.318
have a way of
clearing themselves up.

32:01.620 --> 32:04.123
Okay, well, just...

32:04.156 --> 32:06.425
I feel like I should
at least check on him.

32:06.458 --> 32:08.827
-Make sure he's...
-No, he's resting now.

32:08.860 --> 32:11.063
Little bit of
the old snore and drool.

32:11.097 --> 32:14.300
He took a pill, I think,
maybe two. Or three.

32:14.333 --> 32:15.901
As soon as he's wakeys,

32:15.934 --> 32:18.104
I'll have him give you
a ring-a-ding.

32:18.137 --> 32:19.438
Copacetic?

32:21.773 --> 32:24.276
-Five million?
-Bye-bye, Mr. Feltz.

32:28.114 --> 32:29.681
(music playing)

33:20.999 --> 33:22.501
(breathing heavily)

33:27.005 --> 33:28.640
(clears throat)

33:28.674 --> 33:30.008
(elevator bell dings)

33:30.709 --> 33:31.943
(phone ringing)

33:35.281 --> 33:36.515
Anderson said
he couldn't wait,

33:36.548 --> 33:38.016
said you should call
to reschedule.

33:39.518 --> 33:40.552
You okay there, chief?

33:42.554 --> 33:43.689
I just...

33:44.356 --> 33:45.357
(coughs)

33:45.391 --> 33:46.758
Give me a minute.

33:47.559 --> 33:48.927
(continues coughing)

33:49.861 --> 33:50.862
Jeez.

33:53.765 --> 33:54.933
I'm okay.

33:57.035 --> 33:58.604
(retches)

34:00.372 --> 34:01.573
(coughs)

34:04.543 --> 34:05.677
(pants)

34:05.711 --> 34:07.113
Well, that's not right.

34:13.885 --> 34:15.787
(music playing)

34:17.389 --> 34:19.291
WOMAN: Oh, jeez. Call 911.

34:20.559 --> 34:22.694
(machine beeping)

34:22.728 --> 34:24.163
MAN 1: Make a hole, guys.

34:24.896 --> 34:26.498
(indistinct chatter)

34:27.299 --> 34:28.734
MAN 2: Stay with us.

34:28.767 --> 34:30.569
MAN 1: Almost there.

34:30.602 --> 34:31.937
MAN 2: Running fast.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.907
Almost there. Come on.

34:35.941 --> 34:37.143
Stay with us.

34:38.977 --> 34:41.313
Three, two, one, lift.

34:56.328 --> 34:58.630
(woman speaking indistinctly
over PA)

35:07.839 --> 35:09.875
(machines beeping)

36:01.360 --> 36:02.561
-No.
-How's he doing?

36:02.594 --> 36:04.162
Spoke to Mr. Feltz's doctor
last week.

36:04.196 --> 36:05.397
He says they're still stumped.

36:05.431 --> 36:07.132
Some kind of toxic shock,
sounds like.

36:07.165 --> 36:08.400
What kind of toxic,
is my question.

36:08.434 --> 36:10.336
Toxic as in toxin?
As in poison?

36:10.369 --> 36:11.970
Like that Russian fella.

36:12.003 --> 36:14.373
I already spoke to your boss.
Both of you.

36:14.406 --> 36:15.474
This is harassment.

36:15.507 --> 36:16.808
We're on our lunch break.

36:16.842 --> 36:18.410
Heard it was shepherd's
pie day in the cafeteria.

36:18.444 --> 36:19.878
And here you are.

36:25.116 --> 36:26.552
How's business?

36:26.585 --> 36:28.754
Private company like yours,
it's hard for us to tell.

36:28.787 --> 36:29.988
Newspaper said
you've been buying up

36:30.021 --> 36:31.223
a lot of new
properties though.

36:31.257 --> 36:32.691
Expanding?

36:32.724 --> 36:34.360
(somber music playing)

36:39.431 --> 36:40.699
Wasn't that
your brother's car?

36:40.732 --> 36:42.501
I'm, uh...

36:42.534 --> 36:44.903
I must have parked
somewhere else.

36:46.472 --> 36:48.039
(elevator bell dings)

36:53.712 --> 36:56.114
I had to take a taxi.
I think my car was stolen.

36:56.147 --> 36:58.584
-Stolen? Do you want me to...
-No, no.

36:58.617 --> 37:00.185
I'm just being silly,
probably.

37:00.218 --> 37:02.288
Just forgot where I parked.

37:21.773 --> 37:23.509
(music playing)

37:35.587 --> 37:36.588
Madeline!

37:41.259 --> 37:42.728
Jeez! We've got the intercom.

37:42.761 --> 37:44.229
What the shit is this?

37:44.262 --> 37:46.398
It's... I don't know.

37:46.432 --> 37:48.133
Saw 'em when I came in
this morning.

37:48.166 --> 37:49.267
Thought maybe
you redecorated...

37:49.301 --> 37:50.436
I want...

37:51.603 --> 37:53.472
They have logs
at the front desk, yeah?

37:53.505 --> 37:55.140
-Yes.
-The comings and goings

37:55.173 --> 37:56.241
and... Cameras!

37:56.274 --> 37:57.576
Mr. Stussy, you're hurting me.

37:57.609 --> 37:59.110
Oh, sorry.

37:59.144 --> 38:03.181
You know, maybe Mr. Varga...
He does that thing sometimes.

38:03.214 --> 38:05.417
-Maybe...
-I bet that's it, Maddy.

38:05.451 --> 38:08.086
Probably he told me
and I forgot.

38:08.119 --> 38:09.287
I'm sorry about your arm.

38:09.321 --> 38:11.857
No, it's...
You were surprised, is all.

38:13.459 --> 38:14.926
After what happened to Sy...

38:14.960 --> 38:16.094
Your darn brother.

38:16.127 --> 38:18.196
You want me to call him?

38:19.965 --> 38:20.966
My brother?

38:21.800 --> 38:23.669
No. Mr. Varga.

38:24.703 --> 38:27.138
No. No.

38:27.172 --> 38:28.607
See if you can find out
what happened

38:28.640 --> 38:30.476
to the old pictures.

38:30.509 --> 38:32.678
Make sure
they don't throw them out.

38:53.765 --> 38:55.333
(cell phone ringing)

39:00.005 --> 39:02.073
(man speaking indistinctly
on cell phone)

39:04.943 --> 39:06.011
(grunts)

39:08.013 --> 39:09.347
MEEMO: It's him.

39:13.251 --> 39:14.986
VARGA: Mr. Stussy...

39:15.020 --> 39:16.955
-He's alive.
-VARGA: Who?

39:17.389 --> 39:18.757
Ray.

39:18.790 --> 39:21.927
Somehow he...
I can feel him watching me.

39:21.960 --> 39:24.663
Your dead brother?
How interesting.

39:24.696 --> 39:28.366
Listen. I think we should...
I think we need more men.

39:30.035 --> 39:32.337
What kind of men? Short men?

39:32.370 --> 39:33.371
Melancholy?

39:33.405 --> 39:34.706
I'm not kidding.

39:35.541 --> 39:38.444
What if they're... A new move.

39:38.477 --> 39:39.711
Setting me up...

39:39.745 --> 39:41.379
They?

39:41.413 --> 39:42.914
Ray and the girl.

39:42.948 --> 39:44.583
She's still out there
according to

39:44.616 --> 39:46.518
the cops and the newspapers.

39:46.552 --> 39:48.620
And you said yourself,
your man never came back so...

39:48.654 --> 39:49.721
VARGA: Canada.

39:50.388 --> 39:51.623
What?

39:51.657 --> 39:55.861
If the girl is alive... If...

39:55.894 --> 39:57.629
Then she did what
any smart person

39:57.663 --> 39:59.030
wanted for murder would do

39:59.064 --> 40:01.366
and then she ran away
to Canada.

40:01.399 --> 40:03.268
Ray's car was parked
in my spot.

40:03.902 --> 40:05.270
The Corvette.

40:05.303 --> 40:06.605
At the hospital.

40:08.239 --> 40:09.340
You were at the hospital?

40:10.742 --> 40:13.712
And now I'm standing
in my office.

40:13.745 --> 40:16.582
-And all the pictures are...
-Emmit?

40:16.615 --> 40:18.183
Emmit, are you listening?

40:18.750 --> 40:19.951
Yes.

40:20.586 --> 40:23.054
You won.

40:23.088 --> 40:24.756
I won? What did I win?

40:26.124 --> 40:27.425
Life.

40:28.594 --> 40:30.095
Sit tight.

40:30.128 --> 40:32.564
Meemo will be over presently
to take you home.

40:32.598 --> 40:34.466
There's some papers to sign.

40:35.501 --> 40:37.769
You're selling
a shopping mall.

40:38.537 --> 40:40.138
I own a shopping mall?

40:54.119 --> 40:55.787
(music playing)

41:38.329 --> 41:39.430
(grunts)

41:51.910 --> 41:53.111
(sighs)

42:08.526 --> 42:09.761
What?

42:12.530 --> 42:13.699
(gasps)

42:14.465 --> 42:16.134
(grunts)

42:17.368 --> 42:18.369
Help!

42:21.206 --> 42:22.407
Help!

42:29.648 --> 42:32.117
(phone ringing)

42:34.485 --> 42:35.887
MEEMO: Mustache.

42:36.755 --> 42:37.989
He has a what?

42:39.090 --> 42:41.226
And you were here
the whole time?

42:41.259 --> 42:42.594
EMMIT: It's me.

42:43.328 --> 42:44.730
It's my fault.

42:46.431 --> 42:48.266
VARGA: Did he sign the papers?

42:51.102 --> 42:52.537
Emmit,
we've talked about this.

42:52.570 --> 42:55.707
If you don't sign the papers,
we don't make the money.

42:55.741 --> 42:58.877
No. No more papers.

42:58.910 --> 43:00.311
No more signing.

43:00.345 --> 43:02.580
Something's going on here.

43:02.614 --> 43:05.583
A hand reaching out
from beyond the grave.

43:05.617 --> 43:07.118
Things I've done.

43:07.819 --> 43:09.254
Transgressions.

43:10.155 --> 43:12.090
And now, death.

43:13.091 --> 43:14.993
Creeping close.

43:15.026 --> 43:17.562
Step by step.

43:17.595 --> 43:21.066
A... a father
dead on a driveway.

43:21.099 --> 43:25.003
An older brother taking
advantage of a younger...

43:25.036 --> 43:27.472
-Mi amore...
-(gasping)

43:27.505 --> 43:28.674
Settle.

43:30.608 --> 43:31.843
(groans)

43:33.378 --> 43:35.113
(gasping breaths)

43:35.146 --> 43:37.082
You know how I describe you

43:37.115 --> 43:40.151
when I meet with my bankers
and hedge fund managers?

43:40.185 --> 43:42.120
(sighs)

43:42.153 --> 43:44.355
A hero.

43:44.389 --> 43:48.293
Clear of mind.
A man of singular purpose.

43:49.895 --> 43:54.099
But even heroes
can have setbacks.

43:54.132 --> 43:56.634
A messy divorce,
death of a loved one

43:56.668 --> 43:59.270
or a beloved business partner.

43:59.304 --> 44:01.106
Sy's not dead.

44:01.139 --> 44:02.340
-Yet...
-What?

44:02.373 --> 44:03.574
What?

44:05.476 --> 44:10.481
Look, my point is that
you have to remember

44:10.515 --> 44:12.550
that even heroes
can lose sight

44:12.583 --> 44:15.220
of what's real
from time to time.

44:15.253 --> 44:16.822
Take these.

44:16.855 --> 44:18.056
What? What are they?

44:18.089 --> 44:19.657
VARGA: A mild sedative.

44:19.691 --> 44:22.260
Something to
stop the engines racing.

44:27.098 --> 44:28.199
(groans)

44:29.434 --> 44:30.702
Now...

44:31.837 --> 44:35.206
I want you to picture
an island.

44:36.341 --> 44:38.476
Tropical island,
somewhere warm.

44:38.509 --> 44:40.946
South Pacific, perhaps.
Can you see it?

44:42.447 --> 44:45.316
Now I want you to imagine

44:45.350 --> 44:49.420
that on this island,
one day in September, 1945,

44:49.454 --> 44:52.824
a blizzard of paper
fell from the sky.

44:52.858 --> 44:55.693
Leaflets,
dropped in their hundreds

44:55.727 --> 44:57.996
by the allied forces

44:58.029 --> 45:00.832
to tell the Japanese soldiers
stationed there

45:00.866 --> 45:03.101
that the war was over.

45:03.134 --> 45:05.771
The emperor has surrendered.

45:07.372 --> 45:09.107
But down below,

45:09.941 --> 45:14.445
one man refused to believe.

45:14.479 --> 45:20.351
Lieutenant Hiroo Onoda.
A man of honor, values...

45:20.385 --> 45:22.954
And as the rest of the world
went about its business,

45:22.988 --> 45:28.626
1946, 47, 50, 64, 71...

45:28.659 --> 45:30.561
As peace was made,

45:30.595 --> 45:34.599
in a cold war fort
Hiroo Onoda battled on,

45:34.632 --> 45:36.134
a tireless soldier

45:36.167 --> 45:38.870
of the emperor's
imperial army,

45:38.904 --> 45:41.773
and the last man
to die for an ideal.

45:43.674 --> 45:45.176
He was just a boy.

45:47.813 --> 45:52.050
He used to follow me around
after school.

45:52.083 --> 45:57.588
"Emmit, play with me.
Emmit, watch this."

46:03.194 --> 46:05.096
Is the Bible
a children's book?

46:06.697 --> 46:07.999
(sighs)

46:08.033 --> 46:11.269
What we're doing here,
the sober affairs of men...

46:11.302 --> 46:13.104
These are feats
of great strength,

46:13.138 --> 46:14.639
of cunning and fortitude.

46:14.672 --> 46:17.275
Not child's play.
Not the best you can do.

46:18.209 --> 46:20.245
Nobody remembers
the second man

46:20.278 --> 46:21.612
to climb Mount Everest.

46:22.848 --> 46:23.849
That's it.

46:25.050 --> 46:26.284
Sleep now.

46:30.188 --> 46:32.858
Everything will be clearer
in the morning.

46:34.792 --> 46:36.794
(opera music playing)

47:02.753 --> 47:03.922
(door closes)

47:31.382 --> 47:34.319
Well... (sighs)
That's it for me then.

47:34.352 --> 47:37.923
-Gotta pay the sitter.
-Okay, Chief.

47:37.956 --> 47:41.326
Told you. You can't
call me that anymore.

47:41.359 --> 47:43.361
I'm a Deputy now, same as you.

47:52.603 --> 47:54.940
I'll run the rest of these
tomorrow. Which, you know...

47:54.973 --> 47:56.441
If serving eviction notices

47:56.474 --> 47:57.976
doesn't give you a sense of
hope and purpose, what will?

48:05.416 --> 48:07.085
You know what?

48:27.238 --> 48:29.807
Throw this in the "Outgoing"
for the morning?

48:29.840 --> 48:31.642
EMMIT: My name's Emmit Stussy.

48:33.678 --> 48:35.246
I want to confess.

48:37.082 --> 48:39.084
(upbeat music playing)

50:00.165 --> 50:01.666
(music playing)

50:48.546 --> 50:49.680
MAN 1: Now I get it.

50:49.714 --> 50:51.048
MAN 2: Oh, jeez.
