00:02.420 --> 00:04.001
Dr. Brennan
just left me a note...

00:04.088 --> 00:07.125
saying that
you should meet here
and wait for her.

00:07.216 --> 00:09.673
And she didn’t say why
we were all called together?

00:09.760 --> 00:10.886
Sorry.

00:10.970 --> 00:13.302
You’re the head of the lab.
Shouldn’t you know?

00:13.389 --> 00:15.050
Yes.
Yes, I should.

00:15.141 --> 00:18.224
But with Dr. Brennan,
all the conventional rules
of the universe become obsolete.

00:18.311 --> 00:20.472
- Right.
— She should be here soon.

00:20.563 --> 00:22.053
Good luck.

00:22.148 --> 00:24.230
G—Good luck?

00:24.317 --> 00:26.774
We’ve never all been called in
to work together before.

00:26.861 --> 00:29.147
Okay, look, until
Dr. Brennan gets here,

00:29.238 --> 00:32.025
I think I should be in charge,
being the only one
with his doctorate.

00:32.116 --> 00:33.777
You’re still just an intern
like the rest of us.

00:33.868 --> 00:36.610
Which actually makes you
less qualified. You should
be much further along.

00:36.704 --> 00:38.535
[Snaps Fingers]
I know what’s going on here.

00:38.623 --> 00:41.706
She called us together
so she can watch us
destroy each other.

00:41.792 --> 00:43.953
The saw ripped through
the xiphoid process
and sternum.

00:44.045 --> 00:47.583
—Oh, my God.
—There’s fluid on those as well
as the left ribs four and five.

00:47.715 --> 00:50.206
What are you doing?
I reckon we were
all called here to work.

00:50.301 --> 00:52.087
Okay, now,
my granddaddy said,

00:52.178 --> 00:53.668
“Idle talk
is like a mama bear...

00:53.763 --> 00:56.300
whose cubs have
long since gone
in search of another teat.”

00:56.432 --> 00:58.468
Wow.
What the hell
does that mean?

00:58.559 --> 01:00.971
It’s some crazy—ass
white thing.

01:01.062 --> 01:04.145
I don’t care what it is.
I’m getting to work.
I need thisjob.

01:07.944 --> 01:09.980
Last night’s basketball game
got me thinking about teams.

01:10.071 --> 01:11.561
Didn’t I say
you’d like basketball?

01:11.656 --> 01:14.238
Phil Jackson says
they’re like organisms...

01:14.325 --> 01:16.361
that can only survive
through interdependence.

01:16.494 --> 01:18.450
Wait. Phil Jackson?
Yes, yes.

01:18.537 --> 01:20.152
I’ve been reading
his book. See?

01:20.289 --> 01:22.996
You got enough Post—its
in there, Bones?
I’m an assiduous note taker.

01:23.084 --> 01:25.200
Bones, watching basketball
should be fun.

01:25.294 --> 01:28.252
You don’t have to memorize
Kobe Bryant’s three—point
shooting percentage...

01:28.339 --> 01:29.795
in order
to enjoy the game.

01:29.882 --> 01:32.168
Career average—
Mr. Bryant shoots .336,

01:32.260 --> 01:35.923
but with a little more
arc in his shot,
he could be over .450.

01:36.013 --> 01:37.469
It’s just basic geometry.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.884
How’d I leave myself
open for that?
Poor defense.

01:40.017 --> 01:41.473
Poor defense?
Yes.

01:41.560 --> 01:43.846
l have the interns
coming in today
to work on a project.

01:43.938 --> 01:47.476
According to Mr. Jackson,
I plan to incorporate
numerous “attaboys”...

01:47.566 --> 01:50.558
while also administering
reassuring pats
on their hindquarters.

01:50.695 --> 01:53.107
Right.
So you’re the coach.
Of course.

01:53.239 --> 01:54.945
Phil says—
Now it’s “Phil.”

01:55.032 --> 01:58.524
He says that our real legacy
is not what we accomplish
individually...

01:58.619 --> 02:00.359
but what we do
for others...

02:00.454 --> 02:03.491
and how we motivate them
to work together
for a common goal.

02:03.582 --> 02:08.497
Right, well, I’m thinking paying
your players $20 million a year
is motivation in itself.

02:08.587 --> 02:10.623
l was hoping
buying their lunch
might help.

02:10.715 --> 02:12.205
Well—

02:14.427 --> 02:16.463
There seems to be some fabric
embedded in the cut...

02:16.554 --> 02:19.421
that transected
the xiphoid process— Hey.

02:19.557 --> 02:21.843
Huh, this looks like fuzz
from a tennis ball.
[ Device Beeps ]

02:21.934 --> 02:24.175
It is from a tennis ball.

02:24.270 --> 02:26.556
Oh, well,
I recognized it first—
the fuzz. The fuzz was mine.

02:26.647 --> 02:30.231
- After I pointed it out.
- I think the fluid is oil that
seeped out from the chain saw.

02:30.318 --> 02:32.525
Of course it is.
Why are you examining
these remains?

02:32.611 --> 02:34.112
I didn’t direct you
to do that.

02:34.196 --> 02:36.107
The kid started it.
I was—
I was waiting for you.

02:36.198 --> 02:38.985
You— Isn’t this why
you brought us here?

02:39.076 --> 02:40.737
I mean, it’s a fascinating
set of remains.

02:40.828 --> 02:44.036
This is just a foolish man
who tried to juggle
a chain saw,

02:44.123 --> 02:47.035
a tennis ball
and a Fuji apple
after drinking too much.

02:47.126 --> 02:49.082
Your task is
far more challenging.

02:50.963 --> 02:52.419
Follow me.

02:53.466 --> 02:54.922
Oh.
I wonder how much he drank.

02:55.051 --> 02:57.793
Make sure
you get the gloves off.
Excuse me, excuse me.

02:59.430 --> 03:02.922
[ Door Opens ]
[ Brennan ]
Over the past four years,

03:03.017 --> 03:06.555
the Jeffersonian has
digitized all available
Missing Persons data.

03:06.645 --> 03:09.773
You are now able
to cross—reference
that information...

03:09.857 --> 03:13.099
in the hope of identifying over
a thousand sets of remains...

03:13.194 --> 03:16.607
that have been
unidentifiable
up to now.

03:16.697 --> 03:20.155
W-We’ve been relegated
to the hall
of hopeless cases?

my five best interns.

03:23.996 --> 03:26.203
Do you think
I made a mistake,
Mr. Fisher?

03:26.290 --> 03:28.246
— Because I can replace you.
- Oh.

03:28.334 --> 03:31.041
— [ Chuckles ]
- Do you think laughing
at Mr. Fisher...

03:31.128 --> 03:33.164
will enhance your status
in my eyes, Mr. Bray?

03:33.255 --> 03:34.711
No, |— No.

03:34.799 --> 03:36.539
I tried to take a leadership
role earlier, Dr. Brennan,

03:36.634 --> 03:38.420
to avoid this kind
of childish behavior.

03:38.511 --> 03:40.752
And why couldn’t you,
Dr. Edison?

03:40.846 --> 03:43.428
Perhaps because you
don’t have their respect?

03:44.392 --> 03:46.132
Do you respect him,
Mr. Vaziri?

03:47.144 --> 03:48.600
Is this a trick question?

03:48.687 --> 03:50.723
That depends on
how frightened you are
of making a mistake.

03:50.815 --> 03:53.352
How can any one of you
do yourjob...

03:53.442 --> 03:57.026
if what you really want
is for one of your other
teammates to fail?

03:57.113 --> 03:59.069
Well, you’ve always told us
to rely on ourselves.

03:59.156 --> 04:01.112
You’ve created quite
a competitive atmosphere here.

04:01.200 --> 04:04.818
And it will
remain competitive,
Mr. Abernathy.

04:06.455 --> 04:08.241
Phil Jackson
wants us to ask...

04:08.332 --> 04:12.371
- [ Mouthing words]
- what it is we are
competing to achieve...

04:12.461 --> 04:16.545
and how you’ll work
together to achieve it.

04:16.632 --> 04:20.545
Phil Jackson,
like the tall
Phil Jackson?

04:20.636 --> 04:22.092
Yes.

04:22.179 --> 04:25.296
It is ourjob as
forensic anthropologists...

04:25.391 --> 04:28.428
to give as many
of these people as possible
their identities back.

04:28.519 --> 04:30.555
lf teamwork
doesn’t help,

04:30.646 --> 04:36.266
then we can always go back
to having the constant threat of
dismissal hang over our heads.

04:36.402 --> 04:39.815
Okay?
[ All Talking At Once]

04:40.823 --> 04:42.404

05:24.200 --> 05:28.443
Some of these remains
have fingers removed,
probably to hide fingerprints.

05:28.537 --> 05:31.995
Here’s one covered in concrete,
gentlemen. Concrete.

05:32.082 --> 05:34.164
Which is why
this is so hard.

05:34.251 --> 05:36.082
Yes, because it could
indicate espionage.

05:36.170 --> 05:39.583
Someone clearly wanted to make
sure that the secrets died
with them.

05:39.715 --> 05:42.377
Really? You had to add some kind
of international
conspiracy?

05:42.510 --> 05:44.671
This isn’t hard enough?
It doesn’t have to be
international.

05:44.762 --> 05:47.424
— Concrete guy could end up
being Jimmy Hoffa.

05:53.354 --> 05:57.347
The interarticular fracture on
the thumb screams cowboy thumb.

05:57.441 --> 06:00.148
Coupled with the abrasions
on the L2 and L3...

06:00.236 --> 06:01.976
and the sequins
in her effects,

06:02.071 --> 06:04.983
I’m calling

06:07.034 --> 06:08.899
that went missing
in March of 1980.

06:08.994 --> 06:11.110
Nicely done, Fisher.

06:11.205 --> 06:13.321
Over 30 years.
Very impressive, Mr. Fisher.

06:13.415 --> 06:14.996
Yes. Yes, it is.

06:15.084 --> 06:16.699
Gloating really
isn’t a part of team play.

Every team has a star,

06:18.671 --> 06:20.502
Yes, it does,
and l have before me...

06:20.589 --> 06:22.705
a blacksmith who
vanished in 1898,

06:22.800 --> 06:24.631
114 years ago.

06:24.718 --> 06:26.504
Hold your praise
until the brother talks.

06:26.595 --> 06:29.632
Based on the lateral
epicondylitis of
the elbowjoint...

06:29.723 --> 06:31.429
as well as the high
level of strontium—

06:31.517 --> 06:34.930
Based on the erratic
ossification of the pubic
symphysis, he’s in his 50s.

06:35.020 --> 06:38.808
Compression fracture of
the cervical body of the C7
with subluxation of the—

06:38.899 --> 06:40.890
Ah, hell, it’s milker’s neck.

I give you ice fisherman,
Chad Winacky,

06:45.906 --> 06:49.023
suspected murder victim
who disappeared 18 years ago.

06:49.118 --> 06:51.734
And he has all the markers
for a woodcutter’s lesion,

06:51.829 --> 06:54.616
which would confirm his identity
as George Lido.

06:54.707 --> 06:56.948
This is a beautiful thing
to watch.

06:58.877 --> 07:01.084
All right, now, Arastoo,
you’re the only one without—

07:01.171 --> 07:02.957
Yeah, I know, Dr. Hodgins.

07:03.048 --> 07:05.084
I drew a homeless man
who was found beaten...

07:05.175 --> 07:06.881
in a sleeping bag behind a parking garage.

07:06.969 --> 07:09.460
So far, all I
have to go on is
a chipped tooth...

07:09.555 --> 07:11.637
and a complex fracture
to the sixth
left rib.

07:11.724 --> 07:13.931
Come back to him after
you’ve scored a few points.

07:14.018 --> 07:16.600
I mean, we were told to identify
as many of these as possible.

07:16.687 --> 07:18.177
Yeah, I guess.

07:23.527 --> 07:25.028
Maybe
he was part of a conspiracy,

07:25.112 --> 07:26.727
and that’s
why he has no identity.

07:26.822 --> 07:29.188
Found this soot staining
his chipped tooth.

07:29.325 --> 07:31.486
God only knows
what that could be.
[ Hodgins ] Conspiracy?

07:31.577 --> 07:35.161
You think so?
’Cause, you know, I could
run this through the mass spec.

07:40.210 --> 07:42.747
I’m impressed that Dr. Brennan
sees the value in teamwork.

07:42.838 --> 07:44.294
You’ve been a good influence
on her.

07:44.381 --> 07:46.292
All I did was get her to watch
a basketball game...

07:46.383 --> 07:48.169
instead of watching
another rerun of NOVA.

07:48.302 --> 07:49.792
That’s it?
Yeah.

07:49.887 --> 07:51.798
Next thing I know, she’s reading
all about Phil Jackson.

07:51.889 --> 07:53.470
You really didn’t do much,
then, did you?

07:53.557 --> 07:55.013
Really? I didn’t do much?

07:55.100 --> 07:56.601
You try to get her to
stop watching NOVA.

07:56.727 --> 07:58.968
You’re right.
Good point. Sorry.
Because of that,

07:59.063 --> 08:02.681
her squint squad has identified
18 sets of remains.

08:02.816 --> 08:04.352

Good.

08:04.443 --> 08:05.979
I’m so glad you feel that way,

08:36.809 --> 08:39.016

one set of remains.

08:39.103 --> 08:41.469
I know. I’m still waiting
for mass spec results
from Dr. Hodgins.

08:41.563 --> 08:43.849
There are hundreds
of other remains
you could be focusing on.

08:43.941 --> 08:46.523
I didn’t think you’d want me
to give up until
I exhausted every avenue.

08:46.610 --> 08:48.771
Unless you’re wasting resources.

08:48.862 --> 08:51.945
Why do you feel these remains
take precedence over the others?

08:52.032 --> 08:54.819
The police report
says that he was beaten.

08:54.910 --> 08:57.868
Nothing more.
They wrote him off
because he was homeless.

08:57.996 --> 09:00.863
And this.
A bullet wound.

09:00.958 --> 09:02.869
There’s no mention
of him being shot?

09:02.960 --> 09:05.542
Because it happened at least
10 years before his death.

09:05.671 --> 09:08.504
Look at
the remodeling.
It’s a large—caliber bullet.

09:08.590 --> 09:11.127
Perhaps it could lead us
to medical records
which could give us a name.

09:11.218 --> 09:15.382
You said ourjob is to
give identities back
to these victims.

09:15.472 --> 09:18.964

and leave this man
behind that parking garage,

09:21.812 --> 09:25.054

from the mass spec.

So the particulates embedded
in his tooth...

consist of kerosene
and ethylene glycol.

From the way it seeped into
the dentin, there was a lot.

09:34.450 --> 09:36.190
Why was he covered in jet fuel?

09:36.285 --> 09:37.991
He was found miles
from the airport.

09:44.960 --> 09:47.918
You let Vaziri go out
on his own. That doesn’t
happen in a team sport.

09:48.005 --> 09:50.246
You kidding me? That’s—
That’s more like swimming.

09:50.340 --> 09:52.877
A good coach recognizes
the strengths of her players.

09:52.968 --> 09:55.254
He wasn’t going
for an easy lay—up
like the others.

He’s more of a bruiser
down low.

09:56.889 --> 09:59.756
I need you to check
the police reports again.

09:59.850 --> 10:02.717
He was homeless.
I mean, cops,
theyjust bury cases like this.

It’s clear
the coroner did.

H—He didn’t even record
that the victim had
suffered a bullet wound.

10:07.274 --> 10:10.232
Exactly, which makes it
more unlikely that
I’ll be able to dig up his name.

10:10.319 --> 10:11.855
I’m trying to put you
in the game, Booth.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.560
If you’d prefer not to play,
just say so.

10:13.655 --> 10:16.488
Bones, all I’m saying is that
sometimes during the game,

10:16.575 --> 10:19.066
you just have
to realize that
you just can’t win.

10:19.203 --> 10:20.818
So you’re a quitter?
What? No.

10:20.913 --> 10:23.780
That’s what I heard.
l’d trade you if I wasn’t
in the middle of the season.

10:23.916 --> 10:26.828
I can’t believe this.
This game isn’t over
until I say it is.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.825
So are you in
or are you out?
I’m in, Bones.

10:28.962 --> 10:31.920
Okay, let’s go.
Attaboy.

10:32.007 --> 10:33.588
What are you—

10:35.803 --> 10:38.135
So, the police report
that Booth dug up...

10:38.222 --> 10:42.215
lists the time of death
as the same time
that the body was discovered.

10:42.309 --> 10:44.925
— [ Hodgins ]
Well, that can’t be right.
- Not if he looked like this.

10:45.020 --> 10:47.477
[ Hodgins ] They probably
thought it didn’t matter
because he was homeless.

10:47.564 --> 10:50.852
l was hoping you could give me
an accurate time of death.
It might help.

10:50.943 --> 10:53.059
What was the weather
on the day he was found?

10:55.155 --> 10:57.191
Sunny and mid—70s.

10:57.282 --> 10:59.489
Hmm. What about
the week before?

10:59.576 --> 11:02.113
It was pretty warm all week,
between 70 and 80,

11:02.204 --> 11:04.445
rain on the 20th
and 21st.

11:04.540 --> 11:07.327
Under conditions like this,
based on decomp,

11:07.417 --> 11:10.659
death occurred
between three to five days
before he was discovered?

11:10.754 --> 11:13.336
Can you enlarge and enhance
the decomp on the neck?

11:13.423 --> 11:15.334
Calliphoridae
in the decomposing tissue.

11:15.425 --> 11:17.837
They’re carrion flies, and
look, they laid their eggs.

11:17.928 --> 11:20.920
So that means
that he was dead four days
when this was taken.

11:21.014 --> 11:24.677
Okay, so he died
on September 21.

11:24.768 --> 11:27.259
Does that help you?
Oh, my God.

11:29.815 --> 11:31.726
Jet fuel?
Yeah.

11:31.817 --> 11:33.682
Can you check for
other evidence of fuel?

11:33.819 --> 11:36.777
We have our own remains
to work on, you know.
Sure.

11:36.864 --> 11:40.197
There’s slight staining
on the acromion.
That could be from the fuel.

11:40.284 --> 11:41.740
We should do analysis
of the bone...

11:41.827 --> 11:43.658
to see if there’s
other chemicals or
environmental markers.

11:43.787 --> 11:45.869
I’ll help you
take samples.
Me too.

11:45.956 --> 11:48.493
There seems to be
something embedded
in the fracture.

11:48.584 --> 11:50.370
What’s going on?
Why are we all working
on this guy?

11:50.460 --> 11:54.373
— We’re a team.
— Yeah, but not really.

11:54.464 --> 11:58.002
Dr. Hodgins needs to see this.
There’s a metal fragment
embedded in the rib.

11:59.636 --> 12:01.422
This rib fracture— Fisher.

12:01.513 --> 12:03.253
The remodeling seems
to indicate it was fractured...

12:03.348 --> 12:05.725
more than four days
before he died, doesn’t it?

12:05.809 --> 12:08.391
— Definitely.
— Wait.

12:08.478 --> 12:10.139
Are you thinking what
I think you’re thinking?

12:10.230 --> 12:13.393
What are you thinking?
What’s going on here, guys?

12:13.483 --> 12:15.895
You’re the best at estimating
bone remodeling, aren’t you?

12:15.986 --> 12:19.069
Yes, and it gives me
absolutely no satisfaction.

12:19.156 --> 12:21.613
Okay, we need to know
exactly when
this rib was broken.

12:22.784 --> 12:24.490
[ Fisher Sighs]
[ Clark]
Come on.

12:26.163 --> 12:27.653
[Whirring]

12:27.748 --> 12:31.912
Evidence of osteoblasts
and chondroblasts.

12:32.002 --> 12:34.163
I’m falling behind
on my remains.
Am I gonna get credit for this?

12:34.254 --> 12:35.334
Fisher.

12:38.550 --> 12:41.007
The soft callus hasn’t
consolidated yet.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.346
I’d put this break 10 days
before he died.

12:47.017 --> 12:51.135
Dr. Saroyan and Dr. Hodgins
fixed time of death
on September 21.

12:54.441 --> 12:58.559
That means
this injury occurred
September 11, 2001.

12:58.654 --> 13:00.235
Yeah.

13:00.322 --> 13:02.028
My God.

13:03.325 --> 13:05.065
9/11.

13:05.160 --> 13:08.448
Given the presence ofjet fuel
and his injuries,

13:08.538 --> 13:10.745
this man could have
been at the Pentagon
when the plane hit.

13:10.832 --> 13:14.541
Yeah, but every victim of that
attack has been accounted for
andidenﬂﬁed.

13:15.379 --> 13:16.869
Maybe not.

13:18.215 --> 13:20.126
Maybe just the victims
who had a home.

13:26.974 --> 13:31.217
The interns are working hard
to get as much new information
as possible.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.393
If we can reconstruct
what happened to him...

13:33.480 --> 13:36.313
from September 11
until 10 days later
when he died,

13:36.400 --> 13:37.856
we might be able to
find out who he is.

13:37.943 --> 13:41.276
Do you wonder if he wanted
to remain anonymous
for a reason?

13:41.405 --> 13:43.361
You’re really starting
to sound like Hodgins.
I’m a profiler.

13:43.448 --> 13:45.313
l have to approach this
from that perspective.

13:45.409 --> 13:49.243
Okay, the people who mounted
the attack were anonymous
members of the community.

13:49.371 --> 13:52.863
Now, there could have been other
anonymous people on the ground
to give them support.

13:52.958 --> 13:55.574
- We’ll just run D.N.A.
— Cam already did.
There were no matches.

13:55.669 --> 13:57.785
Perfect. And he had
a previous bullet wound,
didn’t he?

13:57.879 --> 13:59.335
That could have
been from training.

13:59.423 --> 14:02.381
The wound occurred
approximately 20 years ago.

14:02.467 --> 14:06.005
We also found
evidence of exposure
to high levels of uranium.

14:06.096 --> 14:09.259
— Looks pretty damning.
- The first Gulf War was
about 22 years ago.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.510
Most of the US. shells
were made of
depleted uranium.

14:11.643 --> 14:17.434
Depleted uranium has been linked
to neurological damage, which
could explain his homelessness.

14:17.524 --> 14:21.187
Ah. He’s one of ours.
He took that bullet
during the war.

14:21.278 --> 14:24.566
Now you’re reaching.
There would have been a DNA.
match in the military database.

14:24.656 --> 14:26.942
There was no military database
until the late 1990s.

14:27.034 --> 14:29.776
I’m telling you, this guy
fought in Desert Storm.

14:37.919 --> 14:40.706
So, Booth didn’t want to use
the crime scene photo,

14:40.797 --> 14:43.129
’cause he wanted something
easier to look at.

14:43.216 --> 14:45.081
Sweets thought
he might be a terrorist.

14:45.177 --> 14:47.919
Now is not the time for
conspiracy theories,
Dr. Hodgins.

14:48.013 --> 14:49.002
I agree.

14:50.307 --> 14:53.549
l have looked into every
9/11 conspiracy.
All of them.

14:53.643 --> 14:55.554
None of ’em hold up.

14:55.645 --> 14:59.433
Or l-l should say,
only one of ’em does.

14:59.524 --> 15:03.984
We were attacked by extremists
who hated everything
we represent.

15:04.071 --> 15:08.815
We might not be angels,
but no one deserved
to die that day.

15:10.327 --> 15:11.817
No one.

15:15.290 --> 15:17.497
— [ Sighs]
- [ Typing]

15:21.838 --> 15:25.672
l was in New York...
working as a coroner.

15:27.344 --> 15:30.552
| signed 900 death certificates.

15:33.100 --> 15:38.515
I had to talk to wives,
husbands, children.

15:40.023 --> 15:42.605
[Voice Breaking ]
Sometimes all that was left—

15:42.692 --> 15:44.353
[ Deep Breath ]

15:44.444 --> 15:45.980
I’m so sorry, Cam.

15:46.071 --> 15:50.064
Oh, don’t be. I’m—
[ Clears Throat]
I’m still here.

15:51.368 --> 15:53.154
[ Sighs ]
When’s this
gonna be done?

15:58.542 --> 16:00.032
There he is.

16:08.844 --> 16:11.961
Look, he was there on that day
when the plane hit.

16:12.055 --> 16:15.422
36,000 people pass
through the Pentagon
on an average day, Seeley.

16:15.517 --> 16:19.055
l was a grunt
in a file room on the other
side of the building.

16:19.146 --> 16:21.137
How do you expect me
to recognize him?

16:21.231 --> 16:23.313
Right, okay.
There’s got to be some kind
of surveillance video,

16:23.400 --> 16:24.981
some logs we can
check out here, Ben.

16:25.068 --> 16:27.901
Are you serious?
Everything from that day
is classified.

16:28.029 --> 16:30.315
You know that.
He was wounded in the first
Gulf War. He’s one of us.

16:30.407 --> 16:34.070
Everyone who lost their life
or who was injured that day
is accounted for.

16:34.202 --> 16:36.989
Right. Maybe he slipped
through the cracks.
Security wasn’t as tight back then.

16:37.122 --> 16:39.829
That just makes it harder.
What are you saying?
You’re not gonna help?

16:48.675 --> 16:50.586
I’ll take this picture.
I’ll show it around.

16:50.677 --> 16:53.009
Beyond that,
I don’t know what else
I can do for you.

16:53.096 --> 16:55.587
Look, we went to Afghanistan
because of those attacks.

16:55.682 --> 16:59.300
No matter how bad it ever got,
we would never leave anyone
behind. You know that.

17:02.731 --> 17:04.687
We got to do something.

17:10.113 --> 17:12.024
[VVendeH]
Here’s what we’ve got so far.

17:12.115 --> 17:15.232
He was close by
when the plane hit, and
somehow he got his rib broken.

17:15.327 --> 17:16.783
He took off, went back
to the parking garage...

17:16.870 --> 17:18.326
where he got beaten
10 days later.

17:18.455 --> 17:22.994
Who would beat someone to death
so soon after 9/11?
People were angry.

17:23.084 --> 17:26.747
It’s always the weak ones
who get the brunt of that.
They’re easy targets.

17:26.838 --> 17:28.578
That’s the way
the world works.

17:28.673 --> 17:30.413
Not everyone
looks at the world
like you do, Fisher.

17:30.508 --> 17:34.251
Okay, the ends of the humerus
are also abraded
with no remodeling.

17:34.346 --> 17:38.430
— So he could have
been dragged by his arms.
- Or hung by them.

17:38.516 --> 17:40.347
There’s also damage
to the L4 and the L5.

17:40.435 --> 17:42.346
So if someone used a club
on his knees,

17:42.437 --> 17:44.803
it looks like they took
a whack at his back too.

17:47.651 --> 17:49.687
Is this too difficult for you,
Arastoo?

17:49.778 --> 17:53.566
Because I’d be more than happy
to do as much as needed
to ease your load.

17:53.657 --> 17:55.648
Why would it
be more difficult
for me than anyone else?

17:55.742 --> 18:00.156
Because of—
Because you share the same
religion as those men.

18:02.832 --> 18:05.494
Is it too difficult for you
to work with Dr. Edison?

18:06.586 --> 18:08.622
Um, excuse me?

18:08.713 --> 18:13.878
You share the same religion
with men who cherry—picked
the Bible to justify slavery.

18:13.969 --> 18:16.506
I’m sorry.
I didn’t mean nothing.

18:16.596 --> 18:19.884
But still your words
have meaning, don’t they,
Mr. Abernathy?

18:19.975 --> 18:23.763
Those assumptions you made,
those quick generalizations.

18:23.853 --> 18:26.230
What about the vengeance
and the bloodshed
in the Old Testament?

18:26.314 --> 18:28.396
Okay.
He’s just a kid, Arastoo.

18:28.483 --> 18:31.145
If he’s not old enough
to know, he’s certainly
old enough to learn.

18:32.487 --> 18:34.523
The Crusades,
the Inquisition—

18:34.614 --> 18:37.856
are these events guided
by a religion of peace?

18:37.951 --> 18:39.691
No, they were guided
by self—important men...

18:39.786 --> 18:42.198
who think they know more
than the God
they claim to worship.

18:42.289 --> 18:44.951
This was not
the work of religion.

18:45.041 --> 18:48.374
It was arrogance.
It was hypocrisy.
It was hate.

18:48.461 --> 18:51.874
Those horrible men who
hijacked those planes hijacked
my religion that day too.

18:53.133 --> 18:55.044
They insulted my God.

18:55.135 --> 18:58.047
So, no,
this isn’t “too difficult.”

18:58.138 --> 19:00.470
It’s a privilege to be able
to serve this victim,

19:00.557 --> 19:04.049
to show him the care
and love that was
so absent that day.

19:12.319 --> 19:15.026
Thank you, sir.

19:16.740 --> 19:21.234
I’m sorry. Thank you
for taking the time
to set me straight.

19:22.996 --> 19:26.659
— Yeah, that was awesome, dude.
- [ Arastoo Sighs ]

19:26.750 --> 19:29.082
Make sure
to catalog every injury,
no matter how small.

19:30.920 --> 19:33.662
The end of the metacarpals
on the right hand
are also abraded.

19:33.757 --> 19:36.794
— [ Fisher] No remodeling.
— [Wendell ]
Let’s take it from the top.

19:42.182 --> 19:44.218
[Sighs]

19:46.853 --> 19:49.469
[Sighs]

19:49.564 --> 19:51.270
Hi, Booth.

19:51.358 --> 19:54.020
The interns are cataloging
all the injuries now.

19:54.110 --> 19:58.069
We should be able
to put together
a scenario soon...

19:58.156 --> 20:00.363
that might give us
an idea of what
happened to him.

20:00.450 --> 20:04.489
His name’s Tim Murphy.
He had a wife and a son.

20:04.579 --> 20:07.195
Your friend at the Pentagon
identified him?

20:07.290 --> 20:10.248
No. I spent the day going
to homeless shelters.

20:10.335 --> 20:12.826
Turns out a lot of the guys
from Desert Storm...

20:12.921 --> 20:16.129
ended up going to the one
on Carlton Street.

20:17.425 --> 20:20.258
They kept his effects
for over 10 years?

20:20.345 --> 20:21.881
No. The woman
who runs the place,

20:21.971 --> 20:28.467
she believed that
these guys would come back
and have a normal life.

20:29.437 --> 20:31.393
Have you
contacted his wife?

20:31.481 --> 20:33.563
I’m gonna see her
tomorrow morning.

20:33.650 --> 20:36.437
She hasn’t seen him
in over 15 years.

20:39.823 --> 20:42.109
I need to know
what happened to him,
Bones.

20:44.160 --> 20:46.276
You will, Booth.

20:49.290 --> 20:51.201
I promise.

20:56.172 --> 21:00.711
Tim wasn’t the same
after he came back
from the Gulf.

21:00.802 --> 21:04.090
He was afraid to stay indoors
because of what happened to him
over there.

21:04.180 --> 21:05.681
What happened?

21:05.765 --> 21:08.302
He was in a munitions dump
that got hit.

21:08.393 --> 21:11.931
We tried to pick up
where we left off,

21:12.021 --> 21:14.433
but he just couldn’t do it.

21:14.524 --> 21:17.607
He’d disappear, and then
I’d go searching for him...

21:17.694 --> 21:20.686
and find him sleeping
in a park somewhere.

21:20.780 --> 21:22.281
Did he try
and get any help?

21:22.365 --> 21:25.402
I mean, the VA
has got great programs
for homeless vets.

21:25.493 --> 21:28.235
Tim didn’t trust
anyone to help.

21:29.038 --> 21:30.824
I think he lost faith.

21:30.915 --> 21:33.531
There’s no Purple Heart
for P.T.S.D.’s.

21:33.626 --> 21:37.915
There’s no recognition
for what he sacrificed.

21:40.216 --> 21:43.879
Anyhow, one day,
he—he just vanished.

21:43.970 --> 21:46.256
That was 17 years ago.

21:46.347 --> 21:48.963
So you didn’t know
who Tim knew or anyone
who wanted to harm him?

21:49.058 --> 21:51.344
Like I said,
l—l don’t know anything.

21:51.436 --> 21:53.643
Has your son had
any contact with Tim?

21:53.730 --> 21:59.270
The last time
Sean saw his father,
he was four years old.

22:00.778 --> 22:04.612
Look, I’m sorry.
But I cannot go through
all of this again.

22:04.699 --> 22:07.862
Tim was dead long before
that parking garage,

22:07.952 --> 22:10.284
and the only way
we could move on
was to accept that.

22:10.371 --> 22:14.614
And maybe we were dead to him,
and that’s why he could leave.

22:14.709 --> 22:18.748
No, you weren’t.
We found this
in his personal effects,

22:18.838 --> 22:21.420
one of the few things
that he had.

22:25.136 --> 22:27.252
[Sighs]

22:29.015 --> 22:31.097
I remember this day.

22:33.102 --> 22:36.265
[ Exhales ]
He loved Sean so much.

22:39.943 --> 22:43.151
And I loved him.
[ Chuckles ]

22:43.238 --> 22:45.820
| always loved him.

22:45.907 --> 22:49.274
[Crying ]

23:00.630 --> 23:03.292
Hodgins,
you have to
eat something.

23:03.424 --> 23:05.710
You’re gonna
faint.
Almost done.

23:05.802 --> 23:08.464
Are you still
working on that fragment
they found in the rib?

23:08.555 --> 23:11.467
I think it could tell us where
the victim was standing when
the plane hit the Pentagon.

23:11.558 --> 23:14.891
Well, how?
l-l thought it was just
debris from the plane.

23:14.978 --> 23:16.468
Yeah, I did, too, at first.

23:16.563 --> 23:18.929
But it’s indium tin oxide,
and that wasn’t used
in the plane.

23:19.023 --> 23:22.641
It’s used in the lampposts
which are near the west side
of the Pentagon.

23:22.777 --> 23:26.440
Where the plane hit.
Yeah.
Yeah, look at this.

23:28.116 --> 23:32.155
Sheared off the tops of
the lampposts as it slammed
into the building.

23:32.245 --> 23:34.486
He was hit by fragments
from the lampposts.

23:34.581 --> 23:36.492
I mean, it cracked his rib
and left this behind.

23:36.583 --> 23:38.539
How close was he
to the plane?

23:38.626 --> 23:42.118
Close. Maybe 500 feet
from the plane
as it passed.

23:42.213 --> 23:45.705
Oh, my God.
I can’t imagine that.

23:48.011 --> 23:50.878
If he was standing that close
to the building
when the plane passed,

23:50.972 --> 23:54.339
then maybe these other injuries
are somehow from the debris
when the Pentagon was hit.

23:54.434 --> 23:56.425
Then we’d see scattered
fractures and bruising.

23:56.519 --> 23:59.886
These are all localized—
patellas, acromion,
metacarpals.

24:00.023 --> 24:03.186
I don’t get it. We can figure
out if someone was a blacksmith
a hundred years ago,

24:03.276 --> 24:05.016
but we can’t find out
what happened to this guy.

24:05.111 --> 24:07.853
— Are you okay?
— No! Are you?

24:07.947 --> 24:09.687
This guy was there
on 9/11.

24:09.782 --> 24:11.522
You don’t feel the pressure
to solve this one?

24:11.618 --> 24:14.576
Okay, ifl can
gather the team
here quickly.

24:14.662 --> 24:18.701
I feel having spent some time
in a loony bin,
l have a leg up here.

24:18.791 --> 24:22.033
- Not now, Fisher.
- All right, there is
an elephant in this room,

24:22.128 --> 24:24.414
and it’s standing
between us and the remains.

24:24.547 --> 24:28.586
And until we move the pachyderm
out of the way, we’re not gonna
be able to think clearly.

24:28.676 --> 24:32.589
- I’m sorry. Were you locked
in a loony bin or a zoo?
— [ Scoffs ]

24:33.848 --> 24:35.884
9/11 was a trauma to us all.

24:35.975 --> 24:38.967
Not like this guy
or the people
who died that day,

24:39.062 --> 24:41.428
but it still
changed us, right?

24:41.522 --> 24:43.808
A—And we act like
it doesn’t matter.

24:43.900 --> 24:48.610
Clearly, Wendell
is freaking out here, and you—
You went nuts earlier.

24:49.822 --> 24:52.154
[ Sighs ]
The first rule
at the loony bin...

24:52.241 --> 24:54.232
is to get it all out
in the open.

24:54.327 --> 24:56.488
So that’s what
we’re gonna do,
right here, all right?

24:56.579 --> 24:58.080
I’ll go.

24:58.164 --> 25:02.999
l was in high school.
It was my senior year.

25:03.086 --> 25:05.202
l was—
[ Chuckles ]

25:05.296 --> 25:07.753
breaking into my history
teacher’s desk...

25:07.840 --> 25:10.297
to steal a test
that I hadn’t studied for.

25:11.594 --> 25:13.801
And he walked in,
and he was crying.

25:13.888 --> 25:16.379
He couldn’t care less
what I was doing.

25:17.266 --> 25:20.394
And...
that’s when I found out.

25:21.688 --> 25:24.896
So I—
I talked to him,

25:24.982 --> 25:27.974
that— that stolen test
in my hand.

25:29.654 --> 25:35.615
And we both just sat,
and... we cried.

25:43.167 --> 25:45.249
Next.

25:52.093 --> 25:54.004
Oh, come on.

25:57.974 --> 25:59.930
l was working.

26:01.602 --> 26:05.060
It was, uh,
before school.

26:05.148 --> 26:06.604
Coffee shop.

26:06.691 --> 26:10.855
Everyone was just
staring at the TV.

26:12.155 --> 26:14.237
No one said a word.

26:14.323 --> 26:17.861
The cook came out to watch
with the rest of us.

26:19.996 --> 26:23.204
I still remember the smell
of food burning
on that grill.

26:29.005 --> 26:31.917
l was nine.

26:32.008 --> 26:34.624
l’d gotten in the way
of my stepfather...

26:34.719 --> 26:36.835
hitting my mama.

26:37.847 --> 26:40.179
Then he stuck me
with some scissors.

26:40.266 --> 26:43.383
My mama wanted to take me
to the hospital.

26:45.730 --> 26:48.142
But my hurt didn’t seem
like nothin’...

26:48.232 --> 26:50.188
after we heard
what happened.

26:54.697 --> 26:56.608
l was at morning prayers.

26:59.202 --> 27:01.158
I didn’t believe that day.

27:02.622 --> 27:05.034
I didn’t believe in anything
that day.

27:10.338 --> 27:12.169
[Sighs]

27:12.256 --> 27:13.757
VVendeH?

27:23.226 --> 27:25.342
l was, uh, with my aunt...

27:26.813 --> 27:29.725
from that morning
for the next few days.

27:34.529 --> 27:36.941
My uncle was a firefighter
in New York.

27:39.784 --> 27:41.740
He never came home.

28:00.263 --> 28:01.719
[ Booth ]
So, is your team any closer?

28:01.806 --> 28:04.297
Much further away,
actually.

28:04.392 --> 28:07.725
The bone clues are becoming
more difficult to decipher.

28:07.854 --> 28:10.687
But that might be good.
How could that possibly
be good, Bones?

28:10.773 --> 28:12.309
They’re assuming too much.

28:12.400 --> 28:14.686
I’m having them look
at the evidence as if
they’d never seen it before.

28:14.777 --> 28:16.392
See how the injuries
are connected.

28:16.529 --> 28:18.986
Phil says that
everything is connected.
That’s it.

28:19.073 --> 28:22.031
- No more basketball
for you, okay?
— [ Knocking ]

28:22.118 --> 28:24.450
Seeley.

28:24.537 --> 28:27.370
Ben.
Come on in.

28:27.456 --> 28:29.162
This is my partner,
uh, Temperance Brennan.

28:29.250 --> 28:31.161
- And she’s also my—
- I’m also his mate.

28:31.252 --> 28:33.709
We have a daughter
together.

28:33.796 --> 28:35.297
[ Ben ]
Congratulations.

28:36.465 --> 28:38.296
l, uh,

28:38.384 --> 28:40.249
have some information
about Murphy.

28:40.344 --> 28:44.053
When I heard he was
on the west side
of the building that day,

28:44.140 --> 28:46.005
I talked to some people
who worked there.

28:46.100 --> 28:47.556
A few remembered him.

28:47.643 --> 28:52.103
Apparently, he was
outside every day,
for over a year,

28:52.189 --> 28:54.145
yelling at everyone
in uniform who came in.

28:54.233 --> 28:56.440
— Yelling?
- Yeah.

28:56.527 --> 29:00.111
“Walk in Moore Park.”
He yelled it to everyone.

29:00.197 --> 29:01.937
Walk in Moore Park?

29:02.033 --> 29:03.614
l have no idea
what that means.

29:03.701 --> 29:07.068
- Where’s Moore Park?
— There is no Moore Park.

29:07.163 --> 29:09.199
That’s why it didn’t
make any sense.

29:09.290 --> 29:11.326
People complained
about him all the time.

29:11.417 --> 29:13.248
He was clearly
disturbed.

29:13.336 --> 29:17.750
Security detail
would have to remove him
at least once a week, and, uh,

29:17.840 --> 29:20.331
from what I heard,
it sometimes got ugly.

29:20.426 --> 29:23.088
- How so?
- He’d fight them.

29:23.179 --> 29:25.010
One time he tried
to disarm an officer.

29:25.097 --> 29:28.089
Well, maybe Murphy struck
one of the security detail,

29:28.184 --> 29:30.596
and the officer went after him
to settle the score.

29:30.686 --> 29:33.063
Yeah,
that’s what I thought too.

29:33.147 --> 29:38.107
I tried to get you the logs
for the security team for
those two weeks, but, um,

29:38.194 --> 29:40.810
they said it would take
months of legal maneuvering
to unseal them.

29:43.115 --> 29:44.855
Thanks.

29:51.374 --> 29:53.615
I can’t believe
what a sloppyjob
the damn coroner did.

29:53.709 --> 29:55.791
There’s no record
of his fingernails
being swabbed.

29:55.878 --> 29:57.334
Because
it probably wasn’t done.

29:57.421 --> 29:59.457
But that’s the first thing
you do with the victim
of an assault—

29:59.548 --> 30:01.630
to see if you can find
the assailant’s D.N.A.

30:01.717 --> 30:04.629
Now the bones are clean,
and we have no trace evidence
to examine.

30:04.720 --> 30:06.972
Oh, God.
Yes, we do.

30:07.056 --> 30:09.422
We do?
’Cause I don’t think we do.

30:09.517 --> 30:12.054
Not if we’re focused
on the bones.
We’re fools.

30:12.186 --> 30:15.849
Excuse me?
We’ve been focusing on
the bones. That’s the problem.

30:15.940 --> 30:19.353
But we’re forensic
anthropologists. That’s why
Dr. Brennan planted us here.

30:19.443 --> 30:22.560
No. She planted us here
to get answers.

30:24.448 --> 30:28.236
Scraps of his T—shirt...
and some of his pants.

30:28.327 --> 30:30.443
Coroner probably cut them off
when he examined the remains.

30:30.538 --> 30:33.120
You’re right, Fisher.
I am a fool.

30:33.207 --> 30:36.665
We are. I said “we.”
There’s strength
in numbers.

30:36.752 --> 30:39.710
[Arastoo ] The five of us
were fools to trust
the coroner’s report.

30:39.797 --> 30:41.753
[ Clark]
We should reanalyze his blood.

30:43.968 --> 30:45.458
Maybe it’s not all his.

30:51.475 --> 30:54.308
There’s a Moore Park in Toronto.
There’s one in LA, Miami,
New Zealand.

30:54.395 --> 30:57.762
There’s a Moorpark College.
There’s millions of them.
What’s the connection here?

30:57.857 --> 30:59.688
I wouldn’t read too much
into it, Agent Booth.

30:59.817 --> 31:03.184
What do you mean?
He was out there screaming,
every day, “Walk in Moore Park.”

31:03.279 --> 31:04.769
I mean, it’s got to
mean something, Sweets.

31:04.864 --> 31:07.856
He was ill.
He was paranoid,
probably delusional.

31:07.950 --> 31:11.568
He... could’ve heard the name
Moore Park and created
a fantasy around it.

31:11.662 --> 31:13.163
It might have meant
something to him,

31:13.247 --> 31:14.828
but it would have
no meaning to anyone else.

31:14.915 --> 31:17.497
I think we should just,
you know, focus
on these police reports.

31:17.585 --> 31:20.543
- We’ve already been
through them already.
— Yeah, these just came in.

31:20.629 --> 31:24.998
Complaints filed against
the city by a homeless
activist in 2001.

31:25.092 --> 31:28.175
They accuse the police of
not responding to attacks
on homeless camps.

31:28.262 --> 31:30.423
Look at this.
Twelve incidents
in September.

31:30.556 --> 31:32.797
Mm—hmm.
Theft, assault, rape.
Did the city investigate?

31:32.892 --> 31:34.803
Yeah, and they found
no wrongdoing by the police.

31:34.894 --> 31:36.634
’Cause the witnesses
were unreliable.

31:36.729 --> 31:39.562
Apparently, “unreliable”
is just another word
for “homeless.”

31:39.648 --> 31:41.559
Okay, maybe we’re going
about this all wrong.

31:41.650 --> 31:43.186
I mean, maybe there is
no Moore Park now.

31:43.277 --> 31:47.691
Maybe there was a Moore Park
back in 2001 when he was alive.

31:47.782 --> 31:51.616
I think our time is
better spent tracking down
this homeless activist.

31:51.702 --> 31:55.035
— Oh, my God. Wait.
— What? What?

32:00.878 --> 32:03.415
Walk in Moore Park.

32:03.506 --> 32:06.373
“Walken, Moore, Park.”
That’s it. That’s it.
Look.

32:06.509 --> 32:08.545
I don’t understand.
The— Their names!

32:08.636 --> 32:10.092
Look at their names.

32:10.179 --> 32:13.467
Walken, Moore and Park.
“Walken, Moore, Park.”

32:13.557 --> 32:16.344
He was out there every day
yelling the names
of his friends.

32:16.435 --> 32:19.973
He was completely making sense,
but no one took the time
to notice.

32:20.064 --> 32:22.680
Walken, Moore, Park.
The soldiers!

32:23.984 --> 32:25.520
Again.
[ Fisher Sighs]

32:25.611 --> 32:28.398
We’ve been through these
injuries dozens of times,
Dr. Brennan.

32:28.489 --> 32:31.526
And Phil Jackson
put his team through drills
hundreds of times.

32:31.617 --> 32:32.948
Again, please.

32:33.035 --> 32:35.447
Both the fractured rib
and vertebrae show
signs of remodeling,

32:35.538 --> 32:37.153
indicating they occurred
on September 11.

32:37.248 --> 32:39.739
And the other damage,
the abraded fracturing
of the humeri—

32:39.834 --> 32:41.950
And the acromial processes
and metacarpals—

32:42.044 --> 32:46.629
None of these show remodeling,
indicating the injuries took
place around time of death.

32:46.715 --> 32:50.583
We’re missing something.
You’re certain that all
the fractures are traumatic?

32:50.678 --> 32:52.669
How else would bones break
if not from external trauma?

32:52.763 --> 32:55.596
Wait.
Look at the humeri
and the acromions.

32:55.724 --> 32:59.216
Could he possibly have
suffered a subluxation?
You’re right.

32:59.353 --> 33:04.097
The dislocation would have
caused continuous rubbing.
That would’ve prevented remodeling.

33:04.191 --> 33:07.900
— But it doesn’t explain
the fractures to the patellas.
— Or the fractured vertebrae.

33:07.987 --> 33:11.821
[Finn] I’m not so sure.
Look at the back
of the patellas.

33:11.907 --> 33:13.568
These are internal
stress fractures.

33:13.659 --> 33:16.401
All these injuries
are commonly suffered
by weight lifters.

33:16.495 --> 33:19.032
[ Fisher]
He was too slight
to be a weight lifter.

33:21.500 --> 33:25.584
Military records
indicate that
Walken, Moore and Park...

33:25.671 --> 33:28.788
were all killed
in an ammo dump
in Abdali, Kuwait.

33:28.883 --> 33:31.841
Wait. Didn’t Murphy’s wife
say he was trapped
in an ammo dump?

33:31.927 --> 33:35.169
Yeah, they rescued Murphy,
but these three, they were
killed when the dump blew.

33:35.264 --> 33:38.802
Survivor’s guilt.
His friends died for him.
He couldn’t get past that.

33:38.893 --> 33:41.509
Ben got me these.

33:41.604 --> 33:44.971
You see, Tim Murphy petitioned
the army to award his friends
the Silver Star.

33:45.107 --> 33:48.270
How many times
did he write to them?
Fifty—six times.

33:48.360 --> 33:49.896
So when that didn’t work,

33:49.987 --> 33:52.478
he just planted himself
in front of the Pentagon
and kept trying.

33:52.615 --> 33:54.981
[Cell Phone Rings]
Somehow that
doesn’t sound crazy to me.

33:55.075 --> 33:56.576
[Beeps]
Booth.

33:57.953 --> 33:59.693
Okay. Right.
I’m on my way.

33:59.788 --> 34:01.574
That was Bones.

34:01.665 --> 34:03.747
l was able to separate
the stains.

34:03.834 --> 34:05.870
There was blood on his shirt
from three other people.

34:05.961 --> 34:08.373
So we got a hit
on their DNA.
Yes, all three of them.

34:08.464 --> 34:10.045
So then, we know
who attacked Murphy.

34:10.132 --> 34:13.090
We have their names,
but they weren’t the ones
who attacked him.

34:13.177 --> 34:15.839
Okay, wait. I don’t understand.
How did their blood get on him?

34:15.971 --> 34:19.714
The blood was from three people
who were working at the Pentagon
that day where the plane hit.

34:19.808 --> 34:21.469
— And they lived?
- Yes.

34:21.560 --> 34:23.846
— Well, how did Murphy die?
- We’re not sure yet.

34:23.938 --> 34:26.145
Maybe one of the survivors
can help.

34:36.033 --> 34:39.400
[Woman ]
I never thought
I’d see my family again.

34:39.495 --> 34:41.451
None of us
in there did.

34:41.538 --> 34:44.371
Your left lateral
epicondyle and femur
were crushed, weren’t they?

34:44.458 --> 34:46.369
Yes.

34:46.460 --> 34:49.577
l was pinned
under a concrete beam.
Couldn’t move.

34:49.672 --> 34:52.334
Smoke was
filling the room.

34:52.424 --> 34:55.086
I can’t believe I made it.

34:55.177 --> 34:57.133
Do you recognize
this man?

34:58.264 --> 35:00.346
That’s him.

35:00.432 --> 35:03.265
I’d never forget
that face.

35:03.352 --> 35:05.308
That’s the man who rescued me.

35:06.814 --> 35:08.896
Do you know where he is?

35:09.024 --> 35:11.231
Can I... thank him?
I wish you could.

35:11.318 --> 35:13.900
He died about a week
after the attacks.

35:13.988 --> 35:15.774
What happened to him?

35:15.864 --> 35:18.071
We don’t know yet.
We suspect
he was murdered.

35:18.158 --> 35:20.535
That’s why we wanted
to talk to you.

35:20.619 --> 35:23.952
He lifted the concrete beam
off of you, didn’t he?
All alone.

35:24.039 --> 35:26.496
l-l-l didn’t think
it was possible.
He wasn’t a big man.

35:26.625 --> 35:30.538
And after he freed me,
he went over to two other people
who were pinned.

35:30.629 --> 35:32.540
James Donzig
and Warren Kirk.

35:33.590 --> 35:35.091
That’s right.

35:36.552 --> 35:38.543
I don’t think
he was murdered, Booth.

35:44.560 --> 35:47.552
Because of our preconceptions
about his circumstances,

35:47.646 --> 35:51.013
we all believed
that Mr. Murphy was
the victim of an assault.

35:51.108 --> 35:55.977
Without the exceptional work
of this team, we still
wouldn’t know the truth.

35:56.071 --> 35:58.608
[ Angela ]
So I’ve reconstructed
what they discovered.

35:58.699 --> 36:02.783
[Brennan ] When his rib was
fractured by the debris,
it wasn’t a clean break.

36:02.870 --> 36:06.112
That happened when
he went into the building
to rescue those people.

36:06.206 --> 36:08.663
Wait a second.
You’re saying
that Murphy died...

36:08.751 --> 36:11.914
because he rescued those
three people in the Pentagon?

36:12.004 --> 36:14.541
Exactly.
Finn gave us
our first clue.

36:14.631 --> 36:17.964
The injuries to the patellas
weren’t from being kneecapped
in an assault.

36:18.052 --> 36:20.338
They were acute
transverse fractures.

36:20.429 --> 36:23.421
That’s the same damage that
weight lifters suffer
when they lift too much.

36:23.515 --> 36:26.302
The witnesses descriptions
of Mr. Murphy’s actions...

36:26.393 --> 36:30.602
confirm that he probably
was lifting in excess
of 400 pounds...

36:30.689 --> 36:32.680
of concrete and debris
at the time.

36:32.775 --> 36:34.936
That’s a miracle
considering his size.

36:35.027 --> 36:37.894
At first,
we had no explanation
for the spinal fracturing...

36:39.782 --> 36:41.864
were caused by
the extreme weight
he was carrying.

36:41.950 --> 36:44.282
Next.

36:44.370 --> 36:46.235
And the damage
to his shoulders...

36:46.330 --> 36:48.696
wasn’t from him
being dragged or hung.

36:48.791 --> 36:52.579
They dislocated because
his arms weren’t capable
of lifting so much.

36:52.669 --> 36:55.706
We thought the lack of
remodeling meant the injuries
took place 10 days later.

36:55.798 --> 36:57.880
So why did it take him
10 days to die?

36:57.966 --> 37:00.582
It all comes back
to that plane.

37:00.677 --> 37:02.383
He died because
of the rib fracture.

37:02.471 --> 37:04.211
It was only cracked at first,

37:04.306 --> 37:07.013
but it snapped while he was
lifting the debris...

37:07.101 --> 37:10.343
and bowed inward,
puncturing his lung.

37:10.437 --> 37:13.270
It took him 10 days
to bleed out.

37:16.652 --> 37:19.644
I can’t imagine the pain
he must have been in.

37:21.407 --> 37:25.025
I can’t believe he died
with no one knowing
what he did.

37:38.382 --> 37:43.251
For years,
Tim Murphy was homeless,
and he was forgotten.

37:43.345 --> 37:46.587
He was one of those people
on the streets...

37:46.682 --> 37:48.343
that we try
not to look at,

37:48.434 --> 37:51.722
because the sight of them
is just too painful.

37:54.148 --> 37:56.104
But we’re all cut
from the same cloth.

37:57.317 --> 37:59.308
Tim knew that.

37:59.403 --> 38:02.861
He knew how connected
all of us are.

38:05.534 --> 38:07.490
He knew that if it wasn’t
for his three buddies,

38:07.578 --> 38:12.117
that Tim wouldn’t be alive
on September 11...

38:12.207 --> 38:15.745
to save the lives
of Diane,

38:15.836 --> 38:18.703
Warren and James.

38:22.926 --> 38:27.215
And we wouldn’t be able
to tell Tim’s son...

38:27.306 --> 38:31.925
that his dad didn’t die
a broken man living
on the streets, Sean.

38:34.646 --> 38:39.766
But he was
as brave and noble
as the best of us.

38:42.905 --> 38:44.816
