00:13.472 --> 00:14.431
(beeping)

00:14.473 --> 00:17.100
Gooch? Hey!

00:17.351 --> 00:18.352
Gooch, are you there?

00:19.436 --> 00:20.771
Gooch?

00:20.813 --> 00:22.147
- (voice)

00:20.813 --> 00:22.147
Mama.

00:22.189 --> 00:24.065
Okay, that is not gooch.

00:25.442 --> 00:27.027
Ugh. What is wrong

00:25.442 --> 00:27.027
with this thing?

00:28.403 --> 00:30.572
Gooch!

00:30.614 --> 00:31.740
Go for gooch.

00:31.782 --> 00:33.241
Where are Henry and Ray?

00:33.283 --> 00:35.619
There was an emergency

00:33.283 --> 00:35.619
at the Swellview mall.

00:35.661 --> 00:37.204
Ooh, what happened?

00:37.245 --> 00:40.081
Santa Claus was running around

00:37.245 --> 00:40.081
without his red pants.

00:40.875 --> 00:44.252
But it's not

00:40.875 --> 00:44.252
even Christmas.

00:40.875 --> 00:44.252
Weird, right? (beeping)

00:44.294 --> 00:45.713
(computer)

00:44.294 --> 00:45.713
Your hot dog is ready.

00:45.754 --> 00:48.883
Ugh. I didn't order

00:45.754 --> 00:48.883
a hot dog.

00:48.924 --> 00:50.676
You ordered a hot dog?

00:50.718 --> 00:54.304
No. The snack machine is still

00:50.718 --> 00:54.304
broken and acting all crazy.

00:54.346 --> 00:57.182
(distorted)

00:54.346 --> 00:57.182
Repeat-- you're breaking up.

00:57.224 --> 00:58.684
Gooch.

00:58.726 --> 00:59.935
(alarm beeping)

01:06.901 --> 01:08.360
Hey, Charlotte.

01:08.402 --> 01:12.823
Hey. Are those

01:08.402 --> 01:12.823
Santa's pants?

01:08.402 --> 01:12.823
Yeah.

01:14.700 --> 01:16.201
So, where's Henry?

01:16.243 --> 01:18.495
He's right--

01:16.243 --> 01:18.495
huh, that's weird.

01:18.537 --> 01:20.372
Henry? Come down.

01:20.414 --> 01:22.332
(Henry)

01:20.414 --> 01:22.332
I can't.

01:20.414 --> 01:22.332
My tube isn't working.

01:24.626 --> 01:26.461
Okay, hang on.

01:26.503 --> 01:27.546
(beeping)

01:33.385 --> 01:34.511
(Henry)

01:33.385 --> 01:34.511
Ray?

01:33.385 --> 01:34.511
Yeah?

01:35.136 --> 01:37.932
(Henry)

01:35.136 --> 01:37.932
If you keep doing

01:35.136 --> 01:37.932
that I'm gonna vomit.

01:39.391 --> 01:41.018
(computer)

01:39.391 --> 01:41.018
Your hot dog is ready.

01:43.562 --> 01:45.146
(barking)

01:45.647 --> 01:47.024
What the...

01:47.066 --> 01:49.109
Charlotte, I've told you

01:47.066 --> 01:49.109
no pets at work.

01:49.150 --> 01:50.444
That's not my pet.

01:50.485 --> 01:54.489
That's my lunch,

01:50.485 --> 01:54.489
which I did not order.

01:54.531 --> 01:56.366
Arg.

01:54.531 --> 01:56.366
I thought I fixed that thing.

01:56.408 --> 01:57.868
Why does it keep--

01:59.661 --> 02:02.957
(groans)

01:59.661 --> 02:02.957
Now, why

01:59.661 --> 02:02.957
is that spinning?

02:02.998 --> 02:04.708
I don't know.

02:02.998 --> 02:04.708
Because it's broken?

02:05.333 --> 02:06.752
We've got to find

02:05.333 --> 02:06.752
a good repairman.

02:08.253 --> 02:11.381
Aw, not my sprocket, too.

02:08.253 --> 02:11.381
Gooch!

02:13.383 --> 02:14.384
Go for gooch.

02:14.676 --> 02:16.053
Just get your tool box

02:14.676 --> 02:16.053
and come down here.

02:16.095 --> 02:17.721
We got a lot of stuff to fix.

02:17.763 --> 02:20.348
Ray, you know

02:17.763 --> 02:20.348
there is only one repairman

02:20.390 --> 02:21.850
who can fix things down there.

02:21.892 --> 02:24.436
I'm not calling him.

02:21.892 --> 02:24.436
You need him.

02:24.478 --> 02:25.729
No, I don't need him,

02:25.771 --> 02:27.439
and I will not let him

02:25.771 --> 02:27.439
back into my Man Cave.

02:27.481 --> 02:29.942
Bye.

02:27.481 --> 02:29.942
Don't you press that but--

02:31.568 --> 02:32.820
Who were you

02:31.568 --> 02:32.820
talking about?

02:33.570 --> 02:36.740
Schwoz.

02:33.570 --> 02:36.740
What's a Schwoz?

02:37.699 --> 02:39.242
This guy that used

02:37.699 --> 02:39.242
to work for me.

02:39.827 --> 02:42.287
He built most of this place,

02:39.827 --> 02:42.287
all this cool stuff.

02:43.080 --> 02:45.415
He developed

02:43.080 --> 02:45.415
the technology we use,

02:45.457 --> 02:47.292
built all the weapons

02:45.457 --> 02:47.292
and devices.

02:48.002 --> 02:51.005
Schwoz is a genius.

02:48.002 --> 02:51.005
He sounds awesome.

02:51.046 --> 02:53.298
Awesome guys don't

02:51.046 --> 02:53.298
steal your girlfriend.

02:53.340 --> 02:55.009
Ooh. Wow.

02:55.634 --> 02:57.469
Yeah, that's what I said

02:55.634 --> 02:57.469
when I found out

02:57.511 --> 02:58.303
she'd been Schwoz'd.

02:59.513 --> 03:00.472
(beeping)

03:00.514 --> 03:02.307
(Henry screams)

03:02.349 --> 03:04.018
(grunts)

03:04.059 --> 03:05.602
Oh, man.

03:04.059 --> 03:05.602
Henry.

03:06.812 --> 03:09.564
That...

03:06.812 --> 03:09.564
That really hurt me.

03:09.606 --> 03:12.067
(beeping)

03:09.606 --> 03:12.067
Uh-oh.

03:12.109 --> 03:14.569
Oh, man.

03:12.109 --> 03:14.569
What's wrong?

03:14.611 --> 03:16.237
Santa Claus jumped out

03:14.611 --> 03:16.237
of the police car

03:16.279 --> 03:18.573
and now he's running down

03:16.279 --> 03:18.573
Swellview Boulevard.

03:18.615 --> 03:20.492
But... You've got

03:18.615 --> 03:20.492
his pants.

03:20.534 --> 03:22.911
Exactly. Let's go.

03:31.670 --> 03:33.047
Come on!

03:33.088 --> 03:35.007
Let's just both

03:33.088 --> 03:35.007
take my tube.

03:35.549 --> 03:36.967
All right.

03:43.473 --> 03:45.350
Seriously?

03:43.473 --> 03:45.350
Geez.

03:46.560 --> 03:47.769
(beeping)

03:51.231 --> 03:53.650
You better call Schwoz.

03:51.231 --> 03:53.650
Never.

03:54.193 --> 03:55.694
Who's Schwoz?

03:55.736 --> 03:58.030
Oh, he's this guy who used

03:55.736 --> 03:58.030
to work for me a long--

03:59.031 --> 04:00.741
Ow!

04:03.326 --> 04:04.661
It all just kind of happened.

04:04.703 --> 04:05.996
My dad was

04:04.703 --> 04:05.996
an irresponsible scientist.

04:06.580 --> 04:08.456
I wanted an afterschool job.

04:08.498 --> 04:11.418
And by accident,

04:08.498 --> 04:11.418
he made me indestructible.

04:11.459 --> 04:13.212
(screaming)

04:13.253 --> 04:16.965
(Henry)

04:13.253 --> 04:16.965
I went into this crazy store and

04:13.253 --> 04:16.965
met a pretty interesting guy.

04:17.007 --> 04:18.967
I'm going to blow your mind.

04:19.009 --> 04:21.428
Now I protect

04:19.009 --> 04:21.428
the good citizens of Swellview.

04:21.469 --> 04:23.555
Who call me...

04:21.469 --> 04:23.555
He turned out to be...

04:23.597 --> 04:25.306
(Ray)

04:23.597 --> 04:25.306
You know the name.

04:23.597 --> 04:25.306
Captain Man.

04:25.348 --> 04:26.683
That's right, Henry.

04:26.725 --> 04:29.561
In time, I realized

04:26.725 --> 04:29.561
that being a superhero

04:29.603 --> 04:32.313
is a lot to handle alone.

04:29.603 --> 04:32.313
He wanted some help.

04:32.355 --> 04:33.523
(Ray)

04:32.355 --> 04:33.523
I needed a sidekick.

04:33.565 --> 04:34.942
I, Henry Hart...

04:34.983 --> 04:36.276
(Ray)

04:34.983 --> 04:36.276
Pledge to never ever,

04:34.983 --> 04:36.276
ever tell anyone...

04:36.317 --> 04:38.445
That I'm Captain Man's

04:36.317 --> 04:38.445
secret sidekick.

04:38.486 --> 04:39.821
It is done.

04:39.863 --> 04:41.322
(Henry)

04:39.863 --> 04:41.322
Now we blow bubbles.

04:39.863 --> 04:41.322
(Ray)

04:39.863 --> 04:41.322
And fight crime.

04:41.949 --> 04:42.866
(Henry)

04:41.949 --> 04:42.866
Feels good.

04:57.505 --> 04:59.925
Call it.

04:57.505 --> 04:59.925
Up the tube!

05:00.259 --> 05:02.219
Oh, my boot.

05:02.261 --> 05:02.928
(Ray screaming)

05:11.311 --> 05:11.937
Come on, Henry.

05:15.732 --> 05:17.609
(whistle blowing)

05:15.732 --> 05:17.609
All right, guys, come on.

05:17.651 --> 05:20.028
Hey. Gather around!

05:17.651 --> 05:20.028
Listen up! Let's go!

05:21.989 --> 05:24.449
All right.

05:21.989 --> 05:24.449
When it comes to basketball,

05:24.491 --> 05:26.576
you guys are pretty much

05:24.491 --> 05:26.576
a team of losers.

05:26.618 --> 05:28.245
(all agree)

05:28.829 --> 05:30.705
Who wants water?

05:31.915 --> 05:33.167
Not now.

05:39.589 --> 05:41.967
Okay, where was I?

05:39.589 --> 05:41.967
You were

05:39.589 --> 05:41.967
calling us losers.

05:42.634 --> 05:45.220
Right. Well,

05:42.634 --> 05:45.220
that all changes today.

05:45.929 --> 05:50.725
Boys, meet your new teammate,

05:45.929 --> 05:50.725
Shawn Corbit.

05:52.811 --> 05:58.859
Oh yeah.

05:52.811 --> 05:58.859
How about that, huh?

05:58.900 --> 06:02.361
Shawn, tell your new teammates

05:58.900 --> 06:02.361
a little bit about yourself.

06:02.403 --> 06:03.989
Well...

06:02.403 --> 06:03.989
Use the card.

06:08.869 --> 06:11.038
"My name is Shawn. I'm 14...

06:12.164 --> 06:16.210
Years old.

06:12.164 --> 06:16.210
Nice to meet you guys."

06:19.046 --> 06:20.797
Hart!

06:19.046 --> 06:20.797
Did I say you could murmur?

06:22.007 --> 06:25.719
Sorry. It's just...

06:22.007 --> 06:25.719
I don't mean to be rude...

06:26.636 --> 06:28.889
But Shawn looks like

06:26.636 --> 06:28.889
he's older than 14.

06:30.015 --> 06:33.852
Like, by a lot.

06:30.015 --> 06:33.852
Oh, really?

06:34.393 --> 06:36.313
You want to see

06:34.393 --> 06:36.313
Shawn's birth certificate?

06:36.355 --> 06:39.566
Because I have it. Look at that.

06:36.355 --> 06:39.566
Lookie there.

06:39.607 --> 06:43.028
Shawn Corbit born

06:39.607 --> 06:43.028
14 years ago in Hawaii.

06:43.070 --> 06:45.280
Take a closer look.

06:43.070 --> 06:45.280
Grab it.

06:45.322 --> 06:47.157
Just take it

06:45.322 --> 06:47.157
if you want to see how--

06:50.952 --> 06:53.330
so, you're just going to

06:50.952 --> 06:53.330
let this guy on our team?

06:53.372 --> 06:55.414
How do we know if

06:53.372 --> 06:55.414
he can even play?

06:55.456 --> 06:56.958
(chuckles)

06:57.000 --> 06:58.543
Okay, first team

06:57.000 --> 06:58.543
on the court.

06:59.294 --> 07:00.962
Hurry up! Let's go!

06:59.294 --> 07:00.962
First team!

07:02.797 --> 07:05.675
Let's see if you five idiots

07:02.797 --> 07:05.675
can stop Shawn from scoring.

07:07.094 --> 07:09.137
Shawn, take them to school.

07:17.354 --> 07:20.732
Kaboom!

07:17.354 --> 07:20.732
Who saw that? I saw that.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.609
Oh look, Henry Hart's

07:20.774 --> 07:22.609
on the ground.

07:22.650 --> 07:25.153
Maybe he wants

07:22.650 --> 07:25.153
some company down there.

07:25.195 --> 07:27.364
Look at me, I'm Henry Hart.

07:27.406 --> 07:31.159
I'm on the floor,

07:27.406 --> 07:31.159
and I'm off the team.

07:32.077 --> 07:34.288
What?

07:32.077 --> 07:34.288
Off the--what?

07:35.038 --> 07:36.581
Shawn plays point guard.

07:36.623 --> 07:39.167
You play point guard.

07:36.623 --> 07:39.167
Shawn is awe-some.

07:39.667 --> 07:45.465
You are aw-ful.

07:39.667 --> 07:45.465
So you're off the team.

07:45.506 --> 07:47.550
But that's unfair.

07:45.506 --> 07:47.550
Oh, you want fair?

07:47.592 --> 07:49.886
You want to stay on the team?

07:47.592 --> 07:49.886
Okay, hot pants.

07:50.804 --> 07:53.348
All you got to do is beat

07:50.804 --> 07:53.348
Shawn in a game of one-on-one.

07:53.974 --> 07:57.936
But--

07:53.974 --> 07:57.936
I'll even give you

07:53.974 --> 07:57.936
three whole days to practice.

07:57.978 --> 07:59.687
How does that sound, Shawn?

07:59.729 --> 08:01.731
Well, actually,

07:59.729 --> 08:01.731
I think that maybe--

07:59.729 --> 08:01.731
Just read the card.

08:04.651 --> 08:08.822
"My name is Shawn.

08:04.651 --> 08:08.822
I'm 14...

08:10.073 --> 08:11.325
Years old."

08:17.289 --> 08:20.208
Hey. I really wish you'd

08:17.289 --> 08:20.208
get those things working.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.341
(Henry screaming)

08:35.515 --> 08:38.310
Hey, something's wrong

08:35.515 --> 08:38.310
with the dumb elevator.

08:38.352 --> 08:39.727
Why are you

08:38.352 --> 08:39.727
in such a bad mood?

08:39.769 --> 08:42.439
Because I got kicked off

08:39.769 --> 08:42.439
my dumb basketball team.

08:43.064 --> 08:45.317
Are you good

08:43.064 --> 08:45.317
at basketball?

08:43.064 --> 08:45.317
No.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.610
(screaming)

08:45.859 --> 08:47.610
Charlotte!

08:48.903 --> 08:50.447
You made

08:48.903 --> 08:50.447
the couch spin again.

08:50.489 --> 08:52.491
Why don't you hop on it

08:50.489 --> 08:52.491
and take a ride?

08:55.660 --> 08:59.164
Ray. I found a repairman.

08:55.660 --> 08:59.164
He's on his way down.

08:59.206 --> 09:01.082
What? You can't just send

08:59.206 --> 09:01.082
some stranger down here

09:01.124 --> 09:03.293
until we have him

09:01.124 --> 09:03.293
checked out.

09:01.124 --> 09:03.293
I got to go.

09:06.838 --> 09:07.630
(elevator dings)

09:10.175 --> 09:11.259
(with thick accent)

09:10.175 --> 09:11.259
Hey.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.221
Schwoz.

09:15.263 --> 09:16.431
Get out.

09:17.849 --> 09:21.269
Come on, Ray.

09:17.849 --> 09:21.269
Don't be like that.

09:17.849 --> 09:21.269
I mean it.

09:21.311 --> 09:23.813
Out of here.

09:21.311 --> 09:23.813
That's schwoz?

09:24.814 --> 09:27.692
You must be new sidekick,

09:24.814 --> 09:27.692
Kid Danger.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.236
Don't you talk to Henry.

09:29.277 --> 09:31.279
You keep your Schwoz cooties

09:29.277 --> 09:31.279
off of him.

09:32.822 --> 09:36.076
Come on, man,

09:32.822 --> 09:36.076
it's been three years.

09:36.117 --> 09:38.412
Yeah, since you stole

09:36.117 --> 09:38.412
my girlfriend.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.956
If it makes you feel any better,

09:39.079 --> 09:41.956
I dumped her two weeks later.

09:43.542 --> 09:45.043
Why would that

09:43.542 --> 09:45.043
make me feel better?

09:45.919 --> 09:49.047
Can I get something

09:45.919 --> 09:49.047
to eat?

09:45.919 --> 09:49.047
You could.

09:49.089 --> 09:50.507
If that hunk-a-junk

09:49.089 --> 09:50.507
snack machine

09:50.549 --> 09:52.384
you built actually worked.

09:53.510 --> 09:56.430
I check it.

09:53.510 --> 09:56.430
Don't order a hot dog.

10:08.649 --> 10:12.653
Now... Would anyone

10:08.649 --> 10:12.653
like a nacho tower?

10:13.363 --> 10:15.407
(computer)

10:13.363 --> 10:15.407
Nacho tower.

10:22.247 --> 10:23.748
Whoa.

10:23.790 --> 10:27.294
Nacho tower.

10:23.790 --> 10:27.294
He fixed

10:23.790 --> 10:27.294
the auto snacker.

10:27.335 --> 10:29.504
I don't care.

10:27.335 --> 10:29.504
You ruined our friendship.

10:29.546 --> 10:30.880
And you're not

10:29.546 --> 10:30.880
going to fix that

10:30.922 --> 10:33.758
with a platter

10:30.922 --> 10:33.758
of hot Mexican treats.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.719
Well, I forgive you.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.719
Me too.

10:39.013 --> 10:42.016
Look, you want me to leave,

10:39.013 --> 10:42.016
just tell me, "Leave."

10:43.143 --> 10:45.061
Leave, leave, leave,

10:43.143 --> 10:45.061
leave, leave.

10:47.021 --> 10:48.398
You want me to stay?

10:50.066 --> 10:52.068
Because I could fix up

10:50.066 --> 10:52.068
all the broken schtuff

10:52.110 --> 10:52.944
around this place.

10:52.986 --> 10:54.237
Do it.

10:54.279 --> 10:55.238
No!

10:55.280 --> 10:56.323
Let him fix

10:55.280 --> 10:56.323
the broken schtuff.

10:58.408 --> 11:00.076
All right,

10:58.408 --> 11:00.076
fix the broken schtuff.

11:02.162 --> 11:03.871
And give me a nacho.

11:11.671 --> 11:14.799
Now, who's ready

11:11.671 --> 11:14.799
for technological fun?

11:14.841 --> 11:16.510
Yeah.

11:19.638 --> 11:20.679
Up the tube.

11:22.599 --> 11:24.392
Down the tube.

11:27.395 --> 11:28.313
He fixed the tube.

11:29.356 --> 11:32.400
And I fixed the TVs

11:29.356 --> 11:32.400
and the sprocket.

11:32.442 --> 11:33.901
And watch this.

11:32.442 --> 11:33.901
(beeping)

11:33.943 --> 11:35.654
Security lasers on.

11:38.198 --> 11:40.033
Ooh, lasers.

11:42.035 --> 11:42.952
Ow.

11:43.995 --> 11:47.123
Security off.

11:48.082 --> 11:50.335
Smoochie music on.

11:50.793 --> 11:51.628
(music playing)

11:52.587 --> 11:55.215
♪ Girl, you know

11:52.587 --> 11:55.215
I love you ♪♪

11:55.256 --> 11:57.091
Smoochie music off.

11:57.758 --> 11:59.386
(music stops)

11:59.427 --> 12:03.014
Whoa.

11:59.427 --> 12:03.014
He is impressive.

11:59.427 --> 12:03.014
Yeah, yeah.

12:05.350 --> 12:07.310
Too bad you can't use

12:05.350 --> 12:07.310
your technical skills

12:07.352 --> 12:09.270
to make me

12:07.352 --> 12:09.270
a better basketball player.

12:10.689 --> 12:12.190
Hey...

12:12.232 --> 12:16.027
Who says I can't make you

12:12.232 --> 12:16.027
better basketball player, huh?

12:16.986 --> 12:20.823
I did.

12:16.986 --> 12:20.823
Was I wrong?

12:26.246 --> 12:27.372
Cool sleeve.

12:28.498 --> 12:31.042
Feels good.

12:28.498 --> 12:31.042
I've seen better sleeves.

12:32.377 --> 12:34.337
What are the goggles for?

12:34.379 --> 12:36.797
They are wirelessly connected

12:34.379 --> 12:36.797
to the sleeve with bloop-toop.

12:37.756 --> 12:43.680
Bloop-toop? But I don't

12:37.756 --> 12:43.680
understand how-- whoa.

12:45.098 --> 12:47.100
I didn't know you had a hoop.

12:45.098 --> 12:47.100
Neither did I.

12:48.560 --> 12:49.561
And now...

12:53.314 --> 12:56.317
Take this

12:53.314 --> 12:56.317
and shoot the bashket.

13:00.029 --> 13:02.657
Wait!

13:02.699 --> 13:05.326
What?

13:02.699 --> 13:05.326
Close your eyes.

13:06.453 --> 13:07.954
But I need to see.

13:06.453 --> 13:07.954
No.

13:14.877 --> 13:17.505
What?

13:14.877 --> 13:17.505
Hey, let me try one.

13:24.053 --> 13:26.681
Hey. That's not

13:24.053 --> 13:26.681
what balls are for.

13:26.723 --> 13:29.016
Well, you shouldn't have

13:26.723 --> 13:29.016
kissed my girlfriend.

13:29.726 --> 13:33.062
So, if I wear these goggles

13:29.726 --> 13:33.062
and this sleeve thing...

13:33.104 --> 13:35.398
You will make bashket

13:33.104 --> 13:35.398
every time.

13:36.023 --> 13:39.068
Oh man, this is amazing.

13:36.023 --> 13:39.068
Thanks Schwoz.

13:39.986 --> 13:42.113
I'm going to destroy

13:39.986 --> 13:42.113
that Shawn Corbit guy.

13:42.781 --> 13:46.660
Let us celebrate with smoochie

13:42.781 --> 13:46.660
music and whirly lights.

13:50.580 --> 13:52.831
Whoa. He made whirly lights.

13:56.586 --> 14:03.134
♪ I really want to show you how

13:56.586 --> 14:03.134
I'm feeling smoochie now ♪

14:05.553 --> 14:08.931
♪ I'm feeling smoochie now ♪♪

14:17.064 --> 14:21.068
Come on, Henry.

14:17.064 --> 14:21.068
Yeah.

14:22.696 --> 14:25.406
Whoa, that was like ten

14:22.696 --> 14:25.406
three-pointers in a row.

14:26.199 --> 14:27.701
What do you say

14:26.199 --> 14:27.701
we make it 11?

14:32.955 --> 14:34.290
(cheering)

14:34.332 --> 14:35.709
Hey, great shot.

14:34.332 --> 14:35.709
Don't be nice to him.

14:43.675 --> 14:44.300
Hey there.

14:46.010 --> 14:48.888
Hello.

14:46.010 --> 14:48.888
So, you a teacher?

14:48.929 --> 14:51.098
Yeah, I teach

14:48.929 --> 14:51.098
eighth grade Spanish.

14:51.140 --> 14:54.227
Caliente.

14:51.140 --> 14:54.227
Bueno.

14:55.687 --> 14:58.314
I am schwoz.

14:55.687 --> 14:58.314
You say nothing.

14:59.357 --> 15:00.483
(coach)

14:59.357 --> 15:00.483
Listen up!

15:00.525 --> 15:01.776
This is going to be a game

15:00.525 --> 15:01.776
of one-on-one.

15:01.818 --> 15:02.943
Playing to ten.

15:02.985 --> 15:05.196
The winner stays

15:02.985 --> 15:05.196
on the basketball team,

15:05.822 --> 15:08.074
the loser goes home

15:05.822 --> 15:08.074
to his mommy.

15:09.950 --> 15:12.412
Okay, let's get this over with.

15:09.950 --> 15:12.412
Henry, your ball.

15:20.086 --> 15:22.630
(cheering)

15:32.432 --> 15:34.016
Hey, give me your phone.

15:34.058 --> 15:35.602
Why?

15:35.643 --> 15:38.438
So I can shoot Henry's

15:35.643 --> 15:38.438
disaster from two angles.

15:40.815 --> 15:42.024
I'm going to get

15:40.815 --> 15:42.024
some lemonade.

15:42.066 --> 15:43.902
You want some?

15:42.066 --> 15:43.902
Sure.

15:43.943 --> 15:44.569
Be right back.

16:02.211 --> 16:03.170
Henry!

16:03.212 --> 16:04.798
Try and score this time!

16:06.090 --> 16:06.841
Thanks, Oliver!

16:15.516 --> 16:16.851
Shawn is tall for 14.

16:30.239 --> 16:32.992
Come on, grandma.

16:30.239 --> 16:32.992
Anyone can make instant oatmeal.

16:41.208 --> 16:42.627
Come on, Henry!

16:54.472 --> 16:55.723
Boom!

16:58.810 --> 17:00.728
I thought we were

16:58.810 --> 17:00.728
only playing to ten.

17:00.937 --> 17:02.772
Oh yeah.

17:00.937 --> 17:02.772
(whistle blows)

17:02.814 --> 17:05.149
Game over!

17:02.814 --> 17:05.149
Shawn wins!

17:05.191 --> 17:06.818
Have a nice life, Henry.

17:09.153 --> 17:12.156
One lemonade for me

17:09.153 --> 17:12.156
and one lemonade for...

17:13.366 --> 17:15.117
Schwoz!

17:15.159 --> 17:18.705
Are you kidding me?

17:26.546 --> 17:28.673
Hey.

17:26.546 --> 17:28.673
Oh.

17:28.715 --> 17:30.842
Hi.

17:28.715 --> 17:30.842
I'm sorry, man.

17:31.592 --> 17:34.846
Hey, you won

17:31.592 --> 17:34.846
fair and square.

17:35.889 --> 17:38.057
No I didn't.

17:35.889 --> 17:38.057
What do you mean?

17:41.769 --> 17:45.606
I'm not 14.

17:41.769 --> 17:45.606
I didn't think so.

17:47.817 --> 17:50.277
How old are you?

17:47.817 --> 17:50.277
I'm 26.

17:51.237 --> 17:51.905
I'm a grown man.

17:52.947 --> 17:55.033
I work at Master Prize

17:52.947 --> 17:55.033
Rent-A-Car.

17:56.617 --> 17:58.452
Well, how do you know

17:56.617 --> 17:58.452
Coach Bix?

17:58.494 --> 18:01.539
He came in to rent a car.

17:58.494 --> 18:01.539
He pulled me aside and said,

18:02.040 --> 18:04.042
"I want you to come

18:02.040 --> 18:04.042
play basketball for me."

18:05.418 --> 18:07.628
And you said okay?

18:05.418 --> 18:07.628
No, I said no.

18:08.337 --> 18:09.672
Then why are you

18:08.337 --> 18:09.672
playing ball for him?

18:09.714 --> 18:11.090
Because he kidnapped

18:09.714 --> 18:11.090
my Lulu.

18:12.592 --> 18:15.094
Who's Lulu?

18:12.592 --> 18:15.094
Shawn's puppy.

18:15.135 --> 18:17.680
She's a cockapoo.

18:15.135 --> 18:17.680
Wait a minute.

18:18.305 --> 18:22.268
So you're telling me that your

18:18.305 --> 18:22.268
coach kidnapped Shawn's puppy...

18:22.309 --> 18:23.895
A cockapoo...

18:23.937 --> 18:27.481
And now he's forcing Shawn

18:23.937 --> 18:27.481
to pretend he's 14-years-old

18:27.523 --> 18:29.901
so he can play in your junior

18:27.523 --> 18:29.901
high school basketball team?

18:29.943 --> 18:32.236
Crazy, right?

18:29.943 --> 18:32.236
Uh... Yeah.

18:32.946 --> 18:34.405
Coach won't give Shawn

18:32.946 --> 18:34.405
his puppy back

18:34.447 --> 18:36.908
unless our team wins

18:34.447 --> 18:36.908
the state championship.

18:38.534 --> 18:40.954
Ooh, you're chewing.

18:38.534 --> 18:40.954
What are you going to do?

18:42.204 --> 18:45.458
There are two things

18:42.204 --> 18:45.458
I hate in the world,

18:45.499 --> 18:47.794
and one of them is guys

18:45.499 --> 18:47.794
who kidnap other guys' dogs

18:47.835 --> 18:49.796
to make them do stuff.

18:49.837 --> 18:51.547
What's the other thing?

18:51.589 --> 18:53.132
Celery.

18:51.589 --> 18:53.132
Yeah.

18:53.173 --> 18:54.717
It ruins tuna salad.

18:53.173 --> 18:54.717
Ruins it.

19:02.308 --> 19:05.103
Yeah.

19:02.308 --> 19:05.103
Good old Salisbury steak.

19:08.564 --> 19:09.189
(doorbell rings)

19:10.566 --> 19:12.110
(groans)

19:13.444 --> 19:16.280
Who is it?

19:13.444 --> 19:16.280
(Ray, altering voice)

19:13.444 --> 19:16.280
Look through

19:13.444 --> 19:16.280
your peephole.

19:16.739 --> 19:18.157
All right.

19:27.458 --> 19:29.002
Captain Man?

19:29.043 --> 19:30.628
Hey, I never said

19:29.043 --> 19:30.628
you could come in.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.296
Too bad, jerk.

19:33.380 --> 19:35.174
Hey. I didn't say

19:33.380 --> 19:35.174
you could touch that.

19:35.215 --> 19:39.720
I didn't ask.

19:35.215 --> 19:39.720
Aw, you're a good baby.

19:40.220 --> 19:42.098
Aw, don't you worry,

19:40.220 --> 19:42.098
sweetheart.

19:42.140 --> 19:44.558
You better not take my puppy.

19:45.601 --> 19:49.147
It's not your puppy.

19:45.601 --> 19:49.147
Now, get in the cage.

19:50.148 --> 19:51.482
What?

19:50.148 --> 19:51.482
No. That's for a dog.

19:52.399 --> 19:53.776
One...

19:52.399 --> 19:53.776
Maybe I'll get in the cage.

19:57.237 --> 19:59.323
Shawn, you can come in now.

20:01.784 --> 20:03.202
Lulu!

20:06.080 --> 20:09.416
Here you go.

20:06.080 --> 20:09.416
Aw. Thanks, Captain Man.

20:09.458 --> 20:11.794
Thank you,

20:09.458 --> 20:11.794
for liking puppies.

20:12.545 --> 20:15.173
Come on, Lulu.

20:12.545 --> 20:15.173
Let's go buy matching sweaters.

20:26.059 --> 20:28.061
Whoa, yeah.

20:29.562 --> 20:30.855
(elevator dings)

20:32.190 --> 20:35.317
Okay. I fixed

20:32.190 --> 20:35.317
the elevator.

20:36.152 --> 20:39.947
Good. Thank you.

20:36.152 --> 20:39.947
Now, leave my life.

20:42.658 --> 20:44.202
Okay, boss.

20:46.204 --> 20:48.081
Ray...

20:46.204 --> 20:48.081
Stay out of this, Henry.

20:55.046 --> 20:57.882
Goodbye, peoples.

20:55.046 --> 20:57.882
Schwoz out.

21:01.928 --> 21:03.262
Great.

21:03.303 --> 21:05.264
What happens next time

21:03.303 --> 21:05.264
something breaks around here?

21:05.305 --> 21:07.016
No one else can fix

21:05.305 --> 21:07.016
all this stuff.

21:07.058 --> 21:08.475
Too bad.

21:07.058 --> 21:08.475
He's gone.

21:09.852 --> 21:11.104
(elevator dings)

21:11.145 --> 21:13.106
I still here.

21:14.815 --> 21:15.566
(groans)

21:17.359 --> 21:19.612
All right, Schwoz,

21:17.359 --> 21:19.612
you can have your old room back.

21:19.653 --> 21:21.114
Yeah, baby!

21:22.823 --> 21:25.201
Ah! Get off.

21:26.202 --> 21:27.787
Never leap on me again.

21:27.828 --> 21:33.459
(laughing)

21:40.883 --> 21:42.509
All right, Ray...

21:43.343 --> 21:44.595
Check this out.

21:45.304 --> 21:49.100
No sleeve.

21:45.304 --> 21:49.100
Just the kid.

21:55.773 --> 21:58.317
(crackling)

22:01.361 --> 22:03.656
(both)

22:01.361 --> 22:03.656
Schwoz?

22:32.977 --> 22:34.020
(oven bell dings)

22:34.061 --> 22:35.313
(man)

22:34.061 --> 22:35.313
Mmmm....
