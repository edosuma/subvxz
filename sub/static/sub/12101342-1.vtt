WEBVTT

00:54.454 --> 00:55.757
All this.

00:58.125 --> 00:59.794
Everything will be sucked
into a massive hole,

00:59.827 --> 01:03.565
and then...

01:03.598 --> 01:05.198
all will be fog.

03:18.933 --> 03:20.768
What's that?

03:20.802 --> 03:22.770
Is that more?

03:22.804 --> 03:23.971
Yeah, you want some?

03:24.005 --> 03:25.472
Yeah.

03:29.309 --> 03:30.477
Ahh!

03:53.868 --> 03:55.636
You know, I've dreamt that.

03:55.670 --> 03:57.805
Of what?

03:57.839 --> 04:00.708
Me, in the back of the truck.

04:03.343 --> 04:05.046
You know what
I dream about sometimes?

04:05.079 --> 04:07.314
What's that?

04:07.347 --> 04:09.984
That I'm in the street,

04:10.017 --> 04:13.020
and there are, like,
these long sticks

04:13.054 --> 04:15.556
along both sides,

04:15.590 --> 04:18.593
with a man's head on top.

04:18.626 --> 04:21.461
And as I walk,

04:21.495 --> 04:26.067
one of the bastards' heads
scream down at me.

04:37.578 --> 04:41.348
You know, I have
one of those dreams

04:41.381 --> 04:46.353
over and over and over.

04:46.386 --> 04:48.656
What I see is like
this room,

04:48.689 --> 04:50.323
like a clean room...

04:54.629 --> 04:55.863
...with a ghost inside.

05:04.639 --> 05:10.377
The ghost moves, walks.

05:10.410 --> 05:12.113
There's something scary
about that.

05:24.892 --> 05:26.661
And I know this place is

05:26.694 --> 05:29.664
somewhere far, far away
from here,

05:29.697 --> 05:31.999
far away from this dump,
I can tell you that.

06:12.540 --> 06:13.674
What?

06:29.123 --> 06:30.725
Sorry to bother you
at this hour of the night,

06:30.758 --> 06:33.027
but I've locked myself out.

06:35.129 --> 06:36.764
Do you live here?

06:36.797 --> 06:39.934
I'm on the 11th floor.

06:39.967 --> 06:42.737
They told me there's
a couple in the building, so...

06:45.506 --> 06:46.841
Come in.

06:46.874 --> 06:48.643
Thanks.

07:01.789 --> 07:03.824
A bit grim out there.

07:03.858 --> 07:06.060
Hopefully,
they'll finish the park.

07:06.093 --> 07:07.862
Yeah. I hope so too.

07:07.895 --> 07:09.897
It's a terrific area.

07:09.931 --> 07:12.133
Good.

07:12.166 --> 07:13.935
Are you still settling in?

07:13.968 --> 07:16.170
There's work to be done,
all right.

07:16.203 --> 07:20.608
But still, I'm sure
it's gonna be fine.

07:20.641 --> 07:23.110
Oh... do you think I could
borrow your phone, perhaps,

07:23.144 --> 07:25.146
and try and get through
to management?

07:25.179 --> 07:29.884
Sure, um... yeah.

07:29.917 --> 07:33.187
Yeah, there, it's ringing.

07:47.735 --> 07:50.137
Shit!

07:50.171 --> 07:52.106
There's nobody there.

07:52.139 --> 07:54.942
I guess they're not there
till Monday.

07:54.976 --> 07:56.277
Ah. Um...

07:56.310 --> 07:58.980
We can make a bed
on the sofa.

07:59.013 --> 08:00.281
Are you sure?

08:00.314 --> 08:02.917
That's very kind of you.

08:02.950 --> 08:04.885
Thank you.

08:28.309 --> 08:31.612
Ruth?

08:31.645 --> 08:34.949
Open the...
open the fucking door!

08:37.651 --> 08:40.121
You ruined my life!

08:40.154 --> 08:42.123
You fucking took my life,
you pig,

08:42.156 --> 08:45.192
you ugly, fucking pig!

08:45.226 --> 08:48.829
You made me ugly!

08:53.234 --> 08:54.935
I wish you were dead!

09:02.009 --> 09:04.845
A little of this there,

09:04.879 --> 09:06.647
a little twist like that.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.949
That's it.

09:08.983 --> 09:10.084
- Click.
- Yeah.

09:10.117 --> 09:11.719
Morning.

09:11.752 --> 09:13.687
And...

09:13.721 --> 09:16.257
He's fixed the shower, too.

09:16.290 --> 09:18.159
Don't worry.

09:18.192 --> 09:19.326
I'm here to help.

09:36.811 --> 09:37.945
Thanks, Ron.

09:39.313 --> 09:42.083
Thank you for letting me stay.

09:42.116 --> 09:44.151
Well, you're my neighbor.

09:44.185 --> 09:47.054
You and Ruth,
you're a great couple.

09:47.088 --> 09:50.224
You've got something special.

09:50.257 --> 09:54.128
A new life, it's...

09:55.763 --> 09:58.265
Sometimes, these things,
they can...

09:58.299 --> 10:01.168
well, they can...

10:01.202 --> 10:02.736
crumble.

10:21.922 --> 10:24.158
Little Johnny,
who was about seven, pops in.

10:24.191 --> 10:25.192
Mom and Dad,
Sunday morning,

10:25.226 --> 10:26.694
they're going at it,

10:26.727 --> 10:27.995
humping away like that.

10:32.366 --> 10:34.268
Dad says, "What the fuck
are you doing?

10:34.301 --> 10:35.936
What the fuck are you doing?"

10:35.970 --> 10:37.304
Little Johnny stops,
he looks up,

10:37.338 --> 10:39.240
and he says, "Yeah.

10:39.273 --> 10:41.008
Not so funny
when it's your mother."

10:50.084 --> 10:51.952
- Could you get the remote?
- Yeah.

11:02.830 --> 11:04.298
Should we go?

11:04.331 --> 11:06.233
Hm?

11:06.267 --> 11:09.336
I'm driving Harry
to the supermarket.

11:09.370 --> 11:12.273
- What?
- He wants to buy some snacks.

11:12.306 --> 11:14.241
- Snacks?
- Snacks.

11:14.275 --> 11:15.743
What snacks?

11:15.776 --> 11:16.977
I wanna buy some snacks.

11:17.011 --> 11:19.780
Don't want to be
like a parasite.

11:19.813 --> 11:21.081
I'll drive him.

11:21.115 --> 11:23.851
You stay.

11:23.884 --> 11:25.853
Oh, they're leaning
on each other.

11:27.922 --> 11:29.757
Oh, back they come now,
straight away,

11:29.790 --> 11:32.359
the crowd in a frenzy here
as we head for the bell.

11:32.393 --> 11:34.195
Another and another...

11:37.898 --> 11:40.000
And it's all over!

12:13.467 --> 12:18.072
...that feeling, you know,
like holding someone in...

12:18.105 --> 12:20.040
Where've you been?

12:20.074 --> 12:21.175
I've been calling you.

12:21.208 --> 12:23.545
- My battery went flat.
- Yeah, but your phone was on.

12:23.578 --> 12:25.279
Was it?

12:25.312 --> 12:26.914
What took you so long?

12:26.947 --> 12:28.182
Is there any booze?

12:28.215 --> 12:29.316
There's some in the cupboard.

12:29.350 --> 12:30.317
- Great.
- No!

12:30.351 --> 12:32.019
- Yes.
- Hey!

12:32.052 --> 12:34.054
What?

12:34.088 --> 12:36.023
Ron...

12:38.259 --> 12:39.226
Where are the bottles?

12:39.260 --> 12:40.461
They're mine.

12:40.494 --> 12:42.096
- Come on, Ron, get 'em out.
- No!

12:42.129 --> 12:43.364
It's the weekend!

12:43.397 --> 12:45.032
And why are you so stingy?

12:45.065 --> 12:46.800
- Why are you so stingy?
- Out!

12:46.834 --> 12:48.068
Get out of my house!

12:48.102 --> 12:49.537
This is my house too.

12:49.571 --> 12:51.405
Shut up,
you stupid fucking bitch!

13:08.889 --> 13:10.891
You know, Ron,

13:10.924 --> 13:14.928
I always say the three
most important things in life,

13:14.962 --> 13:16.864
number one,

13:16.897 --> 13:20.301
be nice.

13:20.334 --> 13:23.103
Number two,

13:23.137 --> 13:26.273
be nice.

13:26.307 --> 13:28.142
Number three...

13:37.017 --> 13:38.152
Yeah.

13:41.889 --> 13:44.091
Well, let's have a party,
everybody.

15:14.616 --> 15:19.219
You pig,
you ugly fucking pig!

15:33.434 --> 15:36.236
Mr. Payne, Ronald Payne,
remember me?

15:36.270 --> 15:39.139
Reed Luther, Walter Hill,
I saw you at the pub.

15:39.173 --> 15:40.374
I've got good news
for you and your wife.

15:40.407 --> 15:43.277
You won't be alone
much longer.

15:43.310 --> 15:44.344
Sorry, alone?

15:44.378 --> 15:46.514
After last viewing,
there was a fantastic response.

15:46.548 --> 15:48.348
We're... we're not alone,

15:48.382 --> 15:51.653
there's the guy.

15:51.686 --> 15:54.087
There's a guy
on the 11th floor, he's...

15:54.121 --> 15:55.489
That floor's not finished yet,
but...

15:55.523 --> 15:58.091
No, no, there's a guy,
Harry, he's...

15:58.125 --> 15:59.126
- Harry?
- Harry. He lives on

15:59.159 --> 16:00.762
the 11th floor.

16:00.795 --> 16:02.062
There's no one in the building,

16:02.095 --> 16:03.631
apart from you and your wife.

16:54.448 --> 16:56.350
Up.

16:56.383 --> 16:59.453
Wake up.

16:59.486 --> 17:04.091
I am awake, Ron.

17:04.124 --> 17:06.360
And I don't like what I see.

17:06.393 --> 17:08.295
Time to leave.

17:11.231 --> 17:14.468
I was going anyway.

17:14.502 --> 17:16.571
You know why, Ron?

17:16.604 --> 17:18.472
'Cause you're no fun.

17:22.409 --> 17:24.646
No fucking fun, Ron.

17:28.583 --> 17:30.450
Harry.

17:30.484 --> 17:34.154
Hi, Ruth.

17:34.187 --> 17:36.390
You know something?

17:38.158 --> 17:43.163
Fucking you
is like fucking a carcass.

17:43.196 --> 17:45.567
A fucking carcass.

17:47.735 --> 17:51.573
A brainless fucking carcass!

18:10.157 --> 18:11.491
Uh, here at Duarte Hills,

18:11.526 --> 18:13.661
we're starting
a housing revolution,

18:13.695 --> 18:18.265
and we want you to be part
of our revolutionary lifestyle.

18:18.298 --> 18:22.202
So, step with me
into your brand-new life.

18:22.235 --> 18:23.337
Ground floor.

18:36.751 --> 18:38.418
Dad?

18:38.452 --> 18:41.756
The man in the elevator
looked like an ugly ogre.

18:41.789 --> 18:44.659
Maybe he had a spell
cast on him by a witch.

18:44.692 --> 18:46.561
You told me
witches weren't real.

18:46.594 --> 18:48.730
Because I didn't have
the proof in front of me.

18:48.763 --> 18:50.765
We saw the proof today.

18:50.798 --> 18:53.935
Well... Dad, I didn't say
he was an ogre;

18:53.968 --> 18:56.203
I said he looked like an ogre.

18:57.739 --> 18:59.339
I don't... I don't like this.

18:59.373 --> 19:01.743
Okay, you don't have
to have it, it's all right.

19:08.248 --> 19:09.751
- Dad?
- Yeah?

19:09.784 --> 19:11.753
Will you read me a story?

19:11.786 --> 19:13.788
Of course.

19:13.821 --> 19:16.223
You go to bed,
I'll catch you up.

19:16.256 --> 19:17.725
Can there be a monster?

19:17.759 --> 19:18.960
- Yes.
- Change it up a bit?

19:18.993 --> 19:21.729
- Yes, everything.
- Yay!

19:23.798 --> 19:26.333
There was once
a small village

19:26.366 --> 19:28.870
under the prow
of a mountain,

19:28.903 --> 19:31.338
where no one lived
but squirrels, mice,

19:31.371 --> 19:33.508
and an old woman.

19:33.541 --> 19:34.942
Bor-ing.

19:34.976 --> 19:36.944
You already told me
that story.

19:36.978 --> 19:38.813
All right, well,
I'll come up with a new one.

19:38.846 --> 19:40.480
Can I have a smoke first?

19:40.515 --> 19:41.883
Smoking is bad,

19:41.916 --> 19:43.918
and do it later,
if you have to.

19:43.951 --> 19:45.787
Okay. All right.

19:45.820 --> 19:48.556
Do you promise you will
remember the monsters?

19:48.589 --> 19:49.624
Promise.

19:49.657 --> 19:51.726
One or two?

19:51.759 --> 19:54.428
I'll see what I can do.

19:59.667 --> 20:02.603
In a city,

20:02.637 --> 20:06.641
a city that no longer exists,

20:06.674 --> 20:08.776
there was a merchant...

20:11.411 --> 20:14.782
...who had turned greedy
and mistrustful of other people.

20:22.990 --> 20:26.359
He was once
one of the wealthiest men,

20:26.393 --> 20:28.462
but when his wife left him
for another man,

20:28.495 --> 20:30.798
she took most of his money
with her,

20:30.832 --> 20:32.667
and his good luck left him, too.

20:39.974 --> 20:43.511
One day, a foreigner
came to see him,

20:43.544 --> 20:46.981
a thin man who spoke
in a mysterious way.

20:51.586 --> 20:54.989
Do you believe in God,
Mr. Hals?

20:55.022 --> 20:57.692
And proposed
a lucrative deal to him.

21:00.795 --> 21:02.697
With two valves
at each side,

21:02.730 --> 21:04.832
you'll save
more than half the energy.

21:04.866 --> 21:06.801
The pressure will rise
and the energy will rise,

21:06.834 --> 21:08.536
you understand?

21:08.569 --> 21:10.671
And of course, by placing it
on the northern side,

21:10.705 --> 21:12.740
as you can see,

21:12.774 --> 21:15.308
the fluids will be let
to the southern side,

21:15.342 --> 21:16.811
and because of
the compression underneath,

21:16.844 --> 21:18.546
on the northern side,

21:18.579 --> 21:20.915
we'll avoid
any overheating problems.

21:20.948 --> 21:23.851
And from then on,
all gains, Mr. Hals.

21:23.885 --> 21:25.452
You'll double,
you'll triple,

21:25.485 --> 21:28.656
you'll get your money back
tenfold.

21:28.689 --> 21:31.592
They say life is
a bad business deal,

21:31.626 --> 21:33.393
and this is
a good business deal.

21:33.426 --> 21:35.997
So this means this deal
is better than life,

21:36.030 --> 21:37.765
you understand?

21:37.799 --> 21:41.569
Sure. But what if
something goes wrong?

21:41.602 --> 21:44.605
We're talking about
a lot of money here, a lot.

21:44.639 --> 21:47.975
Mr. Hals, I've been
planning this for years now.

21:48.009 --> 21:50.511
Nothing goes wrong.

21:50.545 --> 21:53.648
It's all beautifully thought.

21:53.681 --> 21:57.018
Listen. Why don't you
leave your plans with me

21:57.051 --> 22:00.888
and I'll have a look
through them in my own time?

22:00.922 --> 22:02.455
No.

22:02.489 --> 22:07.628
These plans need to stay
with me.

22:07.662 --> 22:11.098
I'm sorry, but I can't
make this decision alone.

22:11.132 --> 22:12.900
I'll have to check it
with my accountants

22:12.934 --> 22:17.138
and at least one engineer,
in private.

22:19.006 --> 22:20.473
It's not possible.

22:20.508 --> 22:21.976
I'm afraid
that's not possible.

22:26.080 --> 22:29.016
My apologies.

22:29.050 --> 22:30.551
As you wish.

22:30.585 --> 22:32.019
These are my terms.

22:58.546 --> 23:02.516
Will you take care of my child?

23:02.550 --> 23:04.652
As if it was mine.

23:10.024 --> 23:15.062
Only until the morning,
no longer.

23:15.096 --> 23:17.832
See you tomorrow, same time.

23:28.009 --> 23:29.442
The merchant couldn't
stop thinking

23:29.476 --> 23:32.713
about the foreigner's offer.

23:32.747 --> 23:34.715
If what he said was true,

23:34.749 --> 23:36.183
he could make a lot of money.

23:56.704 --> 23:58.773
But there was one thing
the merchant loved

23:58.806 --> 24:01.609
more than money:

24:01.642 --> 24:05.947
his beautiful daughter, Maria.

24:14.655 --> 24:16.090
Hello.

24:16.123 --> 24:17.992
You look like
you've had a good day.

24:18.025 --> 24:19.794
What's going on?

24:19.827 --> 24:21.195
Nothing.

24:21.228 --> 24:23.496
Why do you look so happy?

24:23.531 --> 24:24.966
Just some business, you know.

24:24.999 --> 24:27.902
Some business, yeah.
Was a good thing?

24:27.935 --> 24:29.770
Might be a good thing,

24:29.804 --> 24:33.074
but a bit too early
to talk about it.

24:33.107 --> 24:35.910
What are you reading?

24:35.943 --> 24:37.712
It's about a robot girl,

24:37.745 --> 24:39.747
and a guy who fancies
the robot girl,

24:39.780 --> 24:41.749
and he also fancies
a normal girl,

24:41.782 --> 24:43.017
and there's also
a creepy old man

24:43.050 --> 24:44.885
who sells eyes.

24:47.922 --> 24:49.991
A creepy old man
who sells eyes?

24:50.024 --> 24:53.761
It sounds all
perfectly normal to me.

24:59.633 --> 25:01.235
What's this business thing?

25:01.268 --> 25:02.236
I'll tell you later.

25:02.269 --> 25:06.240
Mm-hm. Don't make yourself
so important.

25:06.273 --> 25:10.311
- Pass me the wine.
- Mm-hm.

25:10.344 --> 25:14.148
Okay, so listen to this
fact of the day.

25:14.181 --> 25:16.083
Did you know
that dead people

25:16.117 --> 25:17.752
get goosebumps?

25:20.988 --> 25:22.757
What else should I learn today?

25:22.790 --> 25:28.829
Um... iguanas have a third eye

25:28.863 --> 25:29.964
in the middle of their head.

25:29.997 --> 25:33.701
- Where?
- There, boop!

25:35.169 --> 25:36.670
Maria?

25:36.704 --> 25:40.708
Your friend is waiting outside.

25:40.741 --> 25:42.343
- What friend?
- Johann.

25:42.376 --> 25:44.578
- Who's that?
- Someone.

25:44.612 --> 25:45.980
This one new?

25:46.013 --> 25:47.715
Three weeks new.

25:47.748 --> 25:49.150
He writes.

26:07.134 --> 26:08.969
So, my father, Hans.

26:09.003 --> 26:13.607
Dad, this is Johann.

26:13.641 --> 26:16.644
How do you do, Hans?

26:16.677 --> 26:20.347
So, uh, Maria tells me
you write.

26:20.381 --> 26:22.650
Yeah.

26:22.683 --> 26:24.251
What about?

26:24.285 --> 26:27.221
Oh, uh... possible worlds.

26:27.254 --> 26:28.089
I don't think you'd get it.

26:28.122 --> 26:30.057
Maria says you don't read much,
so...

26:33.194 --> 26:35.629
May I have some wine?

26:35.663 --> 26:37.731
Look, Hans, you've got
your good foreign wine,

26:37.765 --> 26:40.634
your homemade desserts,

26:40.668 --> 26:42.303
your house
with high ceilings.

26:42.336 --> 26:43.904
That's the meaning of your life.

26:48.142 --> 26:49.710
Do you wanna know
the meaning of mine?

26:53.013 --> 26:55.149
No.

26:55.182 --> 26:56.717
I gotta go upstairs.

26:56.750 --> 26:58.252
Look, I'm talking to your dad.

26:58.285 --> 27:01.288
You're talking to yourself.

27:01.322 --> 27:02.857
She's great.

27:10.264 --> 27:14.902
Hans, thank you
for a wonderful evening.

27:14.935 --> 27:17.138
I will see you
in the morning,

27:17.171 --> 27:19.073
if we don't wake up too late.

27:25.112 --> 27:27.815
Why did you say...

27:40.761 --> 27:42.696
Good morning, sir.

27:42.730 --> 27:44.331
Mr. Hals is expecting me.

27:44.365 --> 27:46.901
Mr. Hals is not here.

27:46.934 --> 27:49.837
Hm.

27:49.870 --> 27:51.105
I'll wait.

27:51.138 --> 27:53.741
Mr. Hals will be out all day.

27:53.774 --> 27:55.876
What?

27:58.846 --> 28:01.115
This is yours, I believe.

28:01.148 --> 28:03.851
- But...
- Mr. Hals said he's sorry

28:03.884 --> 28:06.787
but he's not interested.

28:06.820 --> 28:10.891
There has to be
some misunderstanding.

28:10.925 --> 28:13.027
It's not possible.

28:13.060 --> 28:14.995
I thought everything
was very clear.

28:15.029 --> 28:16.997
It's all in here.

28:17.031 --> 28:18.465
I'm just his secretary.

28:18.499 --> 28:20.034
In here!

28:28.108 --> 28:29.176
Fine.

29:10.985 --> 29:12.286
Hmph!

29:12.319 --> 29:15.856
This is extraordinary.

29:15.889 --> 29:18.792
It's a work of art.

29:23.264 --> 29:26.267
You're going to make a fortune.

29:26.300 --> 29:28.503
It's incredible, right?

29:28.536 --> 29:34.008
Where did you say
you got all of this from?

29:40.948 --> 29:43.017
It's a real genius.

29:59.099 --> 30:01.435
Hans kept daydreaming
about numbers, sums,

30:01.468 --> 30:04.471
and the term.

30:04.506 --> 30:06.608
Once he got
the foreigner's plan going,

30:06.641 --> 30:08.342
he could at last
think of retiring.

30:32.933 --> 30:35.135
He should take Maria
on a trip.

30:35.169 --> 30:36.604
A long one.

30:39.239 --> 30:42.343
This is a boring story.

30:42.376 --> 30:45.179
Have some patience.

30:45.212 --> 30:47.448
It hasn't finished yet.

31:02.062 --> 31:03.598
Maria?

31:52.079 --> 31:55.015
Listen, I just want you
to have everything.

31:55.048 --> 31:57.251
Yeah, but I don't want
anything else, Dad.

32:07.562 --> 32:10.464
No, I'm not.

32:10.497 --> 32:13.066
Because she ended up
with someone like you.

32:17.104 --> 32:19.006
I have plans.

32:19.039 --> 32:20.608
What plans?

32:28.182 --> 32:32.386
Johann, is Maria with you?

32:32.419 --> 32:33.987
Do you know where she is?

32:34.021 --> 32:37.424
She... she didn't come home
last night.

32:37.458 --> 32:40.194
Please call me
if you hear anything.

32:40.227 --> 32:41.563
Thank you.

32:46.300 --> 32:48.570
The merchant was worried.

32:48.603 --> 32:51.338
Maria had never disappeared
like that.

32:51.371 --> 32:54.007
Why did she suddenly...

33:16.263 --> 33:19.032
"..his wide mouth distorted
into a hideous laugh,

33:19.066 --> 33:20.501
and his little eyes
darting fire

33:20.535 --> 33:23.237
from beneath
their long grey lashes:

33:23.270 --> 33:26.373
'Eh, eh... no barometer...
no barometer?'

33:26.406 --> 33:28.543
he said in a hoarse voice.

33:28.576 --> 33:31.746
'I have pretty eyes too...
pretty eyes!'"

33:34.348 --> 33:36.149
Good morning, Mr. Hals.

33:36.183 --> 33:37.384
Good morning.

33:37.417 --> 33:40.555
The man with the foreign accent
came.

33:40.588 --> 33:42.389
What did he want,
that creep, this time?

33:42.422 --> 33:45.392
He told me to give you this.

33:53.868 --> 33:56.504
Hans Hals' office.

33:56.538 --> 33:57.404
Oh.

33:57.437 --> 33:59.239
It's him... the man,
the foreign man.

33:59.273 --> 34:02.510
Give it to me!

34:02.544 --> 34:04.311
Where is my daughter?

34:04.344 --> 34:06.514
Do you believe in God,
Mr. Hals?

34:15.823 --> 34:18.358
Who is this foreign man?
Does he have a name?

34:18.392 --> 34:20.628
I don't know,
I don't remember.

34:20.662 --> 34:22.864
His name was too long
to pronounce.

34:22.897 --> 34:24.264
I don't know who he is.

34:24.298 --> 34:25.165
I don't know
how he found me,

34:25.198 --> 34:26.834
he just turned up
one day in my office

34:26.868 --> 34:30.838
offering some business deal,
but... but I refused.

34:30.872 --> 34:33.608
I see.

34:33.641 --> 34:36.744
So that's the reason
he's taken poems with him.

34:36.778 --> 34:39.581
He thinks I stole his idea.

34:39.614 --> 34:44.552
- Is that true?
- Of course not.

34:49.289 --> 34:53.828
He, uh... he wants me
to go to this place tonight.

34:53.861 --> 34:57.164
I'd rather not go alone.

36:10.004 --> 36:12.305
Wait for me here.

36:12.339 --> 36:14.575
Shine some light.

37:31.552 --> 37:32.954
Hans!

37:42.563 --> 37:44.431
Let's just get out of here.

37:44.464 --> 37:48.468
Not without Maria.

37:48.503 --> 37:49.637
Let's just call the police.

37:49.670 --> 37:51.338
It's too late for that.

37:51.371 --> 37:52.540
Give me that knife.

38:13.393 --> 38:16.030
- Where are you going?
- I'm going home.

38:16.063 --> 38:18.365
I barely know Maria,
I barely know her at all.

38:18.398 --> 38:20.400
We've been dating
for a couple of weeks.

38:20.433 --> 38:21.636
Listen.

38:21.669 --> 38:26.641
You're not going anywhere.

38:26.674 --> 38:28.009
Open the door.

38:35.082 --> 38:38.820
Hans. Hans, let's get
out of here, please.

38:38.853 --> 38:40.855
Let's go home,
I just wanna go home.

38:40.888 --> 38:42.623
Not without Maria!

38:44.725 --> 38:47.427
You fucking dummkopf!

38:47.460 --> 38:48.663
Get in there.

38:48.696 --> 38:50.731
Get in there!

39:06.848 --> 39:09.750
Shit!

39:13.521 --> 39:14.655
Agh!

39:17.959 --> 39:21.461
Agh!

39:21.494 --> 39:23.496
Oh my God! What now?

39:23.531 --> 39:25.066
You idiot.

39:25.099 --> 39:29.469
- Please, Hans, I...
- Shut up.

39:29.503 --> 39:30.905
Please.

39:46.654 --> 39:48.923
Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus!

39:51.125 --> 39:53.460
Push.

39:55.129 --> 39:56.631
Push harder!

39:56.664 --> 39:58.532
Push hard!

40:13.047 --> 40:15.082
No! Please!

40:26.560 --> 40:30.231
What is this place,
where are we?

40:33.634 --> 40:36.737
This is all your fault.

40:36.771 --> 40:38.639
- Shut up.
- It's all your fault.

40:38.673 --> 40:40.641
Shut up!

40:56.590 --> 40:58.225
What are you doing there?

40:59.727 --> 41:01.996
Huh. Stand up.

41:04.765 --> 41:06.200
Against the wall.

41:11.839 --> 41:13.641
Wait.

41:13.674 --> 41:14.909
W-wait, wait.

41:16.277 --> 41:17.545
Turn around!

41:28.923 --> 41:30.257
You know what
we are going to do?

41:35.229 --> 41:37.198
We'll sell the big one for meat.

41:37.231 --> 41:38.766
Yeah.

41:52.646 --> 41:54.081
No! No, please don't!

42:18.005 --> 42:19.073
Keep up.

42:24.912 --> 42:26.280
Put your head in here.

42:42.096 --> 42:43.697
One, two, three!

43:56.036 --> 43:57.771
That's liquor?

44:47.288 --> 44:48.956
Step on there.

44:58.332 --> 45:00.367
He's too weak.

45:00.401 --> 45:02.136
Fifty cans.

45:02.169 --> 45:04.238
He's not even 30!

45:04.271 --> 45:06.373
How old are you?

45:09.143 --> 45:10.911
Twen... twenty-nine.

45:10.945 --> 45:12.746
See?

45:12.780 --> 45:15.115
Listen, how 'bout
we work together?

45:15.149 --> 45:17.151
Say, 55 cans?

45:17.184 --> 45:18.285
It's 50.

45:18.319 --> 45:21.188
Fifty-two.

45:22.323 --> 45:24.158
All right.

45:25.492 --> 45:27.761
Take him somewhere else.

45:32.132 --> 45:34.401
Always the same.

45:34.435 --> 45:36.170
Deal.

45:36.203 --> 45:37.972
We cannot make a living
out of this.

45:38.005 --> 45:39.340
Come with me.

45:39.373 --> 45:40.874
Learn the market.

46:07.434 --> 46:09.937
Spin faster!

46:09.970 --> 46:11.071
Faster, I said!

46:11.105 --> 46:12.072
Faster!

46:12.106 --> 46:15.075
Up! Up, up, up!

46:17.378 --> 46:19.581
And now, other side.

46:19.614 --> 46:22.016
Yeah, yeah, yeah! Hurry up!

46:24.552 --> 46:26.020
He's slow.

46:26.053 --> 46:29.591
Psh! I hate to mend this chart.

46:29.624 --> 46:33.327
Team lost today two points
because of him.

46:33.360 --> 46:36.830
Why don't you submit
a punishment request?

46:36.864 --> 46:38.899
Could do with a bit of exercise.

46:41.001 --> 46:42.436
I give him one more day.

46:45.372 --> 46:47.609
You're betting on
the anniversary lottery?

46:47.642 --> 46:50.512
Those games are not
for people of no rank.

46:50.545 --> 46:53.247
Yes, they're only made
to entertain us.

46:53.280 --> 46:56.984
The dumbass guards.

46:57.017 --> 46:58.952
I don't mean that.

46:58.986 --> 47:00.287
Faster, I said!

47:00.321 --> 47:04.325
Hurry up, up, up,
up, up, up, up!

48:32.413 --> 48:35.482
Three hundred and ninety-eight!

48:42.456 --> 48:44.526
I want to see his face.

48:51.231 --> 48:53.300
Three hundred
and ninety-eight...

48:56.069 --> 48:59.674
...you've won
the anniversary lottery.

48:59.707 --> 49:02.677
You're out of
this dump tomorrow!

51:07.669 --> 51:09.202
Today's figures.

51:16.443 --> 51:18.178
Thank you.

51:27.220 --> 51:29.489
But, in conclusion,

51:29.524 --> 51:32.492
if we made the boxes
four inches wider,

51:32.527 --> 51:35.262
we could fill
the pallets to capacity,

51:35.295 --> 51:39.634
and this would save us
five pallets per shipment.

51:39.667 --> 51:41.836
- Thank you very much.
- Excellent.

51:41.869 --> 51:44.204
You made my morning, Dom.

51:44.237 --> 51:46.708
Thank you all for coming.

51:56.651 --> 51:59.587
Lazy bastards.

51:59.621 --> 52:02.189
Dom, that was great.

52:02.222 --> 52:04.692
Well, I didn't have
much time to prepare.

52:04.726 --> 52:06.426
Well, doesn't look
like you needed it.

52:06.460 --> 52:08.596
Hey, what are you
doing on Saturday?

52:08.630 --> 52:10.732
- I'll be here if you need me.
- No, no, forget about work,

52:10.765 --> 52:11.799
don't be a bore.

52:11.833 --> 52:13.333
It's my birthday.

52:13.367 --> 52:15.302
I'll have some food
and drinks at the house.

52:15.335 --> 52:16.571
You should come.

52:16.604 --> 52:18.673
Bring the wife!

52:18.706 --> 52:19.941
It'll be fun.

52:19.974 --> 52:21.408
Sophie!

52:47.735 --> 52:49.504
It's for killing
his own family.

52:49.537 --> 52:53.206
- Alex DeLarge set up his own...
- But it is...

52:53.240 --> 52:56.376
For adults living alone,
the housing market...

53:00.682 --> 53:04.317
For more information
on how to get tested...

53:04.351 --> 53:07.220
It's for a world
free of guinea pigs.

53:24.539 --> 53:26.507
Honey,

53:26.541 --> 53:29.443
can you cut up
some of that cherry pie?

53:31.411 --> 53:33.848
Please?

53:36.651 --> 53:38.553
Thanks.

54:03.711 --> 54:05.445
Mum?

54:05.479 --> 54:07.548
Mum, there's a man there.

54:07.582 --> 54:09.851
- What?
- In the kitchen, there's a man.

54:09.884 --> 54:11.586
In the kitchen?

54:14.522 --> 54:16.023
Hm, what?

54:22.830 --> 54:24.866
How did you get in here?

54:27.367 --> 54:30.571
Listen, I don't want
any trouble, okay?

54:30.605 --> 54:33.440
Just, get out.

54:36.376 --> 54:39.547
Please get out?

54:49.757 --> 54:51.424
Mum?

55:05.006 --> 55:08.109
You told me he was dead.

55:08.142 --> 55:10.477
That's what I thought.

55:10.511 --> 55:14.115
Well, what's he doing here?

55:14.148 --> 55:15.683
He's back.

55:18.886 --> 55:20.588
Well, he can't stay here.

55:36.103 --> 55:38.706
Pillow?

55:38.739 --> 55:41.809
Another pillow?

56:03.965 --> 56:05.900
He looks like a tramp.

56:09.103 --> 56:10.671
He wasn't like that.

56:10.705 --> 56:13.875
He's like that.

56:13.908 --> 56:15.710
He creeps me out.

56:18.012 --> 56:20.948
He used to make me laugh
like no one else.

56:23.784 --> 56:27.788
Your dad, Will,
he was good,

56:27.822 --> 56:31.759
a good man...

56:31.792 --> 56:33.694
and then he vanished.

56:33.728 --> 56:35.930
I don't know.

56:35.963 --> 56:37.698
Mum, that guy...

56:39.767 --> 56:42.003
...he's a freak.

58:36.617 --> 58:38.252
You cannot stay here

58:38.285 --> 58:40.221
all alone with him.

58:40.254 --> 58:43.891
Why?

58:43.924 --> 58:46.027
Because that ex-husband of yours

58:46.060 --> 58:47.228
is not right in the head,

58:47.261 --> 58:49.730
he needs to be sent some place.

58:49.764 --> 58:51.232
This is his house.

58:51.265 --> 58:52.333
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

58:52.366 --> 58:53.834
Who pays the fucking bills?

58:53.868 --> 58:55.236
Who bought the sofa

58:55.269 --> 58:57.872
- and the matching curtains?
- On my card.

58:57.905 --> 58:59.006
It's our shared card.

58:59.040 --> 59:02.710
A shared account that
you never put any money into.

59:17.725 --> 59:19.894
Dom,

59:19.927 --> 59:22.630
how do these two
words sound to you?

59:22.663 --> 59:25.332
"Head engineer."

59:29.670 --> 59:31.639
Dom, are you okay?

59:31.672 --> 59:33.074
"Head engineer,"

59:33.107 --> 59:34.909
do you like those words?

59:34.942 --> 59:37.745
Yes, I like them.

59:37.778 --> 59:40.281
Charlie's retiring,
and I want you for the job.

59:40.314 --> 59:42.783
Now, just keep it quiet, okay?

59:42.817 --> 59:45.853
- Tim, that...
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.

59:45.886 --> 59:48.823
Now...

59:48.856 --> 59:51.325
are you a little overworked
at the moment, Dom,

59:51.358 --> 59:53.160
'cause you're looking a little,

59:53.194 --> 59:54.995
little peaky.

59:55.029 --> 59:58.065
You need to have some fun, yeah?

59:58.999 --> 1:00:00.668
Fun,

1:00:00.701 --> 1:00:03.170
we'll fix that at the party
on Saturday, right?

1:00:03.204 --> 1:00:04.939
Hoop!

1:00:10.411 --> 1:00:12.313
Thanks, Tim.

1:00:12.346 --> 1:00:15.082
Ah! Fun.

1:01:06.033 --> 1:01:07.735
This is your fault.

1:01:07.768 --> 1:01:11.172
Dominic is your fault.

1:01:11.205 --> 1:01:14.108
I waited for you,

1:01:14.141 --> 1:01:15.409
but it was too long.

1:01:18.312 --> 1:01:20.147
You gonna say somethin'?

1:01:20.181 --> 1:01:21.448
Hm?

1:01:21.482 --> 1:01:24.351
Speak?

1:01:24.385 --> 1:01:27.454
Where have you been
these last 15 years?

1:01:50.945 --> 1:01:53.013

Big pick up on the fly!

1:03:57.304 --> 1:03:59.139
Defense is split here,
and here it comes!

1:03:59.173 --> 1:04:02.076
Will it be a one-time...
Oh, he shoots, he scores!

1:04:11.151 --> 1:04:13.153
Guess who's
gonna be the next

1:04:13.187 --> 1:04:16.924
head engineer?

1:04:16.957 --> 1:04:21.362
Do you know what this
means for our finances?

1:04:21.395 --> 1:04:23.197
Now, come on.

1:04:23.230 --> 1:04:25.366
Let's try and get along.

1:04:31.639 --> 1:04:35.577
Is that a present?

1:04:35.610 --> 1:04:37.478
You bought me a present?

1:04:41.281 --> 1:04:43.984
A kettle?

1:04:44.017 --> 1:04:45.986
A digital kettle.

1:05:02.704 --> 1:05:04.304
He's sitting in my armchair.

1:05:07.074 --> 1:05:09.611
Rachel!

1:05:09.644 --> 1:05:12.647
Can't you please
say something to him?

1:05:12.680 --> 1:05:15.583
Why don't you say
something to him?

1:05:33.333 --> 1:05:35.469
I'll put the kettle on.

1:05:44.546 --> 1:05:46.046
I wanted to see that.

1:06:31.826 --> 1:06:33.193
Rachel?

1:06:42.570 --> 1:06:46.206
Mrs., uh, Myers.

1:06:46.240 --> 1:06:47.407
Yes.

1:06:49.476 --> 1:06:51.513
Okay, come on.

1:06:57.351 --> 1:06:59.621
So, who's the one,
is it you?

1:06:59.654 --> 1:07:02.122
Him, my husband, Sam.

1:07:02.155 --> 1:07:04.091
Okay, Sam, uh,

1:07:04.124 --> 1:07:06.026
sit here, please, Sam.

1:07:15.435 --> 1:07:18.472
Can you get him back?

1:07:18.506 --> 1:07:20.173
Back to?

1:07:20.207 --> 1:07:22.142
To what he was?

1:07:22.175 --> 1:07:25.279
He disappeared 15 years ago.

1:07:25.312 --> 1:07:27.849
Back then, he was smart,
and he could handle me.

1:07:27.882 --> 1:07:30.183
And now?

1:07:30.217 --> 1:07:31.719
You're the doctor.

1:07:41.596 --> 1:07:43.163
I've seen this before.

1:07:45.867 --> 1:07:51.338
You heard about our methods?

1:07:51.371 --> 1:07:52.674
Electronic mindfulness,

1:07:52.707 --> 1:07:55.475
play it at home,
and read him my ego mantras.

1:07:55.510 --> 1:07:58.278
It's all in the instructions.

1:07:58.312 --> 1:08:00.748
So, is he gonna be normal again?

1:08:00.782 --> 1:08:03.785
Um, well, for a quick recovery,
I do strongly recommend

1:08:03.818 --> 1:08:05.520
the mercury package.

1:08:05.553 --> 1:08:10.157
It is the only one
that includes the, uh...

1:08:10.190 --> 1:08:13.628
healing light.

1:08:13.661 --> 1:08:16.664
He'll speak and all of that?

1:08:16.698 --> 1:08:18.498
All that, yes, just
follow the instructions,

1:08:18.533 --> 1:08:19.734
and everything
will be all right.

1:08:22.837 --> 1:08:25.673
Sam, Sam,

1:08:25.707 --> 1:08:27.742
open the door.

1:08:27.775 --> 1:08:30.545
Sam, Sam,

1:08:30.578 --> 1:08:32.814
open the door.

1:08:32.847 --> 1:08:35.717
Sam, Sam,

1:08:35.750 --> 1:08:37.819
open the door.

1:08:37.852 --> 1:08:39.286
Spread your wings,

1:08:39.319 --> 1:08:41.556
and fly up high.

1:08:41.589 --> 1:08:45.225
Reach out and touch the sky.

1:08:45.258 --> 1:08:48.495
Sam, open the door.

1:08:48.529 --> 1:08:52.366
Let the pain
evaporate like rain.

1:08:52.399 --> 1:08:56.303
Feel the death as
a fresh new breath.

1:08:56.336 --> 1:08:59.641
Sam, Sam,

1:08:59.674 --> 1:09:01.909
open the door.

1:09:01.943 --> 1:09:05.613
Sam, Sam,

1:09:05.647 --> 1:09:06.748
open the door.

1:09:13.621 --> 1:09:15.255
Hi, Will.

1:09:18.926 --> 1:09:20.895
Can I just have a quick word?

1:09:24.699 --> 1:09:26.834
Can you take your
earphones off, Will?

1:09:26.868 --> 1:09:28.335
Just wanna have a word.

1:09:33.574 --> 1:09:36.611
Cheers.

1:09:36.644 --> 1:09:39.246
We are the humans.

1:09:39.279 --> 1:09:41.415
Ah, that's a good line.

1:09:43.283 --> 1:09:45.318
Uh...

1:09:45.352 --> 1:09:48.422
look, I know that, uh,

1:09:48.455 --> 1:09:50.692
you and me have never
really bonded that much,

1:09:50.725 --> 1:09:53.928
but, uh...

1:09:53.961 --> 1:09:55.697
Will...

1:09:55.730 --> 1:09:59.399
I think your mum
needs some help.

1:09:59.433 --> 1:10:01.234
She's so,

1:10:01.268 --> 1:10:04.772
she's so deluded.

1:10:04.806 --> 1:10:07.709
I just feel sorry for her.

1:10:07.742 --> 1:10:11.278
You know, that weird poetry
she keeps reading to that man,

1:10:11.311 --> 1:10:13.346
and that tanning light.

1:10:16.684 --> 1:10:18.920
Well, maybe,

1:10:18.953 --> 1:10:21.421
maybe if you had
a word with her,

1:10:21.455 --> 1:10:22.857
she might listen.

1:10:50.084 --> 1:10:53.921
Feel the death
as a fresh new breath.

1:10:53.955 --> 1:10:56.924
Sam, Sam...

1:10:59.861 --> 1:11:01.596
...Sam,

1:11:01.629 --> 1:11:04.397
Sam,

1:11:04.431 --> 1:11:07.869
Sam, Sam,

1:11:07.902 --> 1:11:09.570
open the door.

1:11:11.706 --> 1:11:14.075
Open the door.

1:11:14.108 --> 1:11:17.779
Spread your wings
and fly up high.

1:11:17.812 --> 1:11:22.482
Reach out, and touch the sky.

1:11:22.517 --> 1:11:25.820
Sam, Sam,

1:11:25.853 --> 1:11:28.923
Sam, Sam,

1:11:28.956 --> 1:11:30.658
open the door.

1:12:52.673 --> 1:12:53.808
Rachel,

1:12:53.841 --> 1:12:57.578
please, can you get ready?

1:12:57.612 --> 1:12:59.412
Got Tim, my boss,

1:12:59.446 --> 1:13:01.916
it's his birthday, remember?

1:13:01.949 --> 1:13:03.084
Shit!

1:13:06.020 --> 1:13:08.089
Dominic,

1:13:08.122 --> 1:13:11.792
you're too negative.

1:13:11.826 --> 1:13:14.128
Rachel, please.

1:13:14.161 --> 1:13:16.664
You've got no light,
you're just

1:13:16.697 --> 1:13:18.733
a black hole.

1:13:21.002 --> 1:13:24.005
I'm learnin' a lot from this.

1:13:24.038 --> 1:13:26.908
There's no more fuzziness here.

1:13:26.941 --> 1:13:30.443
Rachel, I don't
wanna be late, so,

1:13:30.477 --> 1:13:32.880
can you,
can you just put,

1:13:32.914 --> 1:13:34.615
put down the bloody book?

1:13:34.649 --> 1:13:37.852
All these years bringin'
darkness into my life.

1:13:37.885 --> 1:13:42.123
Please, can you cut
this fuckin' crap?

1:13:42.156 --> 1:13:45.760
I can hear my inner voice now,

1:13:45.793 --> 1:13:47.762
and do you know
what it's saying?

1:13:50.264 --> 1:13:51.866
What the hell are
you talkin' about?

1:13:51.899 --> 1:13:56.203
- Please...
- Get Dominic out of the house.

1:14:44.218 --> 1:14:46.988
But it didn't matter
because the actual atmosphere

1:14:47.021 --> 1:14:49.123
that she brought him out in
was really really different!

1:14:49.156 --> 1:14:50.658
- And as you know, and I know...
- Hi, Tim.

1:14:50.691 --> 1:14:53.227
...as well, that it's not
just about the people,

1:14:53.260 --> 1:14:54.795
it's actually about
the organization,

1:14:54.829 --> 1:14:56.897
it's whether or not
we're gonna get along.

1:14:56.931 --> 1:14:59.200
So, she eventually said,
"Okay, that's fine," you know,

1:14:59.233 --> 1:15:00.901
- and that sort of thing.
- Happy birthday, Tim.

1:15:00.935 --> 1:15:03.104
Dom, thanks for coming,
have fun.

1:15:03.137 --> 1:15:05.606
I said, "You are not coming into
my house dressed like that."

1:15:05.639 --> 1:15:06.707
And guess what she said?

1:15:08.843 --> 1:15:10.611

1:15:44.745 --> 1:15:47.648
the one with
the sparkle in her eyes.

1:16:41.669 --> 1:16:43.370
- ...and you are?
- Silence!

1:16:43.404 --> 1:16:45.673

1:21:14.074 --> 1:21:15.643
Let me read.

1:21:15.677 --> 1:21:20.280
"Bless my heart
to make a new start," oh.

1:21:20.314 --> 1:21:22.182
"Fill my void.

1:21:22.216 --> 1:21:25.018
My soul is not yet destroyed."

1:21:25.052 --> 1:21:28.523
What is this piece of shit?

1:21:28.556 --> 1:21:30.124
I want you out of our house.

1:21:30.157 --> 1:21:31.425
Our house?

1:21:31.458 --> 1:21:32.960
Get out of here.

1:21:32.993 --> 1:21:35.963
This is my fucking house!

1:21:35.996 --> 1:21:38.399
And you're my fucking wife!

1:21:38.432 --> 1:21:40.167
This is not your house,

1:21:40.200 --> 1:21:42.302
and you're no longer my husband.

1:21:42.336 --> 1:21:45.139
Oh, you wanna speak
with a lawyer about it?

1:21:45.172 --> 1:21:47.074
A lawyer? A lawyer?

1:21:47.107 --> 1:21:50.144
Okay, let's get a lawyer
'cause I'm gonna sue you

1:21:50.177 --> 1:21:51.345
for every penny you've got.

1:21:51.378 --> 1:21:53.213
I'm gonna empty
your bank account.

1:21:53.247 --> 1:21:54.982
You think you know me,
well, you don't!

1:21:55.015 --> 1:21:57.351
You fucking don't!

1:21:57.384 --> 1:21:59.219
You talk too much.

1:22:02.122 --> 1:22:05.125
Honey! Honey, you're back!

1:22:07.662 --> 1:22:09.396
So, is that it?

1:22:09.430 --> 1:22:10.632
No, wait,

1:22:10.665 --> 1:22:12.366
then he went for the man.

1:22:24.378 --> 1:22:27.314
What about the boy,
what happened to the boy?

1:22:27.347 --> 1:22:28.716
The boy?

1:23:17.164 --> 1:23:18.733
It's okay.

1:23:58.873 --> 1:24:00.440
Is Mum home?

1:24:12.252 --> 1:24:13.655
Mum?

1:24:16.223 --> 1:24:18.760
But what if
the mad dog just

1:24:18.793 --> 1:24:21.395
killed the boy?

1:24:21.428 --> 1:24:24.298
What if he never
fell into this dump?

1:24:24.331 --> 1:24:28.168
Or, what if we'd never
sold him to a factory?

1:24:28.201 --> 1:24:32.172
I mean, think about it.

1:24:32.205 --> 1:24:34.474
Yeah, we could have just
lived together like

1:24:34.509 --> 1:24:37.879
one of them families.

1:24:37.912 --> 1:24:40.548
Maybe in another world.

1:24:40.582 --> 1:24:41.783
Let's drink to that.

1:24:46.386 --> 1:24:48.790
To families.

1:24:48.823 --> 1:24:50.290
To families.
