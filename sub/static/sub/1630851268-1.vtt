02:14.034 --> 02:19.640
In the year 2046, a vast rail
network spans the globe

02:19.640 --> 02:25.712
A mysterious train leaves for 2046
every once in a while

02:25.712 --> 02:29.916
Every passenger going to 2046
has the same intention

02:29.916 --> 02:32.319
They want to recapture lost memories

02:33.053 --> 02:37.290
Because nothing ever changes in 2046

02:38.325 --> 02:40.427
Nobody really knows if that's true

02:40.427 --> 02:44.031
Because nobody's ever come back

02:44.031 --> 02:46.400
Except me

02:57.844 --> 03:01.715
If someone wants to leave 2046...

03:01.715 --> 03:04.685
how long will it take?

03:04.685 --> 03:07.087
Some people get away fairly easily

03:08.255 --> 03:11.658
Others find that
it takes them much longer

03:12.893 --> 03:16.329
I forget how long
I've been on this train

03:17.464 --> 03:20.067
I'm starting to feel very lonely

03:24.671 --> 03:29.042
As I recall, many have gone to 2046

03:29.042 --> 03:33.747
You're the first to come back

03:33.747 --> 03:37.451
May I ask why you left 2046?

03:43.290 --> 03:46.660
Whenever anyone asked
why I left 2046...

03:46.660 --> 03:50.363
I gave them some vague answer

03:53.900 --> 03:54.901
Before...

03:56.036 --> 03:59.306
when people had secrets
they didn't want to share

03:59.306 --> 04:00.741
they'd climb a mountain

04:01.942 --> 04:04.945
They'd find a tree
and carve a hole in it

04:07.314 --> 04:11.184
And whisper the secret into the hole

04:11.184 --> 04:13.620
Then cover it over with mud

04:16.356 --> 04:21.827
That way, nobody else
would ever discover it

04:23.697 --> 04:25.866
I once fell in love with someone

04:27.834 --> 04:30.303
After a while, she wasn't there

04:32.205 --> 04:34.074
I went to 2046

04:35.075 --> 04:39.179
I thought she might be
waiting for me there

04:41.014 --> 04:43.250
But I couldn't find her

04:46.787 --> 04:50.657
I can't stop wondering
if she loved me or not

04:53.593 --> 04:56.062
if she loved me or not

04:57.898 --> 04:59.966
Maybe her answer was like a secret...

05:01.701 --> 05:05.605
that no one else would ever know

05:07.574 --> 05:11.845
All memories are traces <i>of</i> tears

05:28.662 --> 05:30.864
Didn't you promise not to come back?

05:32.566 --> 05:33.800
I came to see you

05:37.270 --> 05:38.338
Why?

05:40.974 --> 05:45.645
I have no prospects here. So <i>I'll</i>
see how things are in Hong Kong

05:51.718 --> 05:53.253
When are you leaving?

05:55.121 --> 05:57.390
The boat sails in two days

06:04.965 --> 06:06.533
Why are you telling me?

06:16.643 --> 06:18.278
I thought we might go together

06:29.723 --> 06:31.424
You know nothing about my past,
do you?

06:36.997 --> 06:39.266
If you'd rather not tell me,
I don't mind

06:54.547 --> 06:56.216
If you win, <i>I'll</i> join you

07:32.886 --> 07:35.121
She found an indirect way of
rejecting me

07:36.323 --> 07:40.860
As I recall that was
the very last time we saw each other

07:40.860 --> 07:42.762
Right after that, I left Singapore

08:07.921 --> 08:10.724
I got back to Hong Kong
at the end of 1966

08:10.724 --> 08:12.859
Because of the price raise of ferry
ticket There was riots in Kowloon

08:15.362 --> 08:17.764
I wasn't sure how long
I'd be staying

08:17.764 --> 08:19.532
So I took a room in a small hotel in
Wanchai. I wrote columns for the Newspapers

08:23.503 --> 08:26.506
They paid HK$10 per thousand words

08:26.506 --> 08:28.808
It was pretty tough at first

08:43.722 --> 08:48.561
As long as I could make ends meet it made
no difference what kind of stuff I wrote

08:49.496 --> 08:50.930
“Diary of the Bazooka Hero”

08:52.232 --> 08:54.367
“The new star at Club
Luk Kwok is Fei Fei!”

08:54.367 --> 08:56.870
“A knockout beauty
with amazing bazookas!”

08:56.870 --> 09:00.106
“A smash hit with tit-lovers!”

09:00.106 --> 09:03.109
Hang on, of course I exaggerate

09:03.109 --> 09:04.711
I can't say her tits are fake, can I?

09:14.387 --> 09:19.192
I soon got used to this kind of life
I became an expert ladies' man

09:19.192 --> 09:23.063
Lots of one-night-stands

09:23.063 --> 09:24.931
But nothing lasts forever anyway

09:40.180 --> 09:44.250
24 December 1966

09:51.291 --> 09:53.226
Is that really true?

09:54.160 --> 09:55.695
Why would I lie to you?

09:56.763 --> 09:58.164
You really know me?

09:59.365 --> 10:02.535
Weren't you in a show in Singapore
in '64?

10:02.535 --> 10:03.536
Yes

10:03.536 --> 10:05.038
You're Lulu

10:17.517 --> 10:20.787
I was then
Not any more

10:21.588 --> 10:22.856
What's your name now?

10:26.493 --> 10:28.027
Why should I tell you?

10:30.330 --> 10:36.603
On Christmas Eve 1966 I ran into
a friend from Singapore in a nightclub

10:36.603 --> 10:39.973
We'd been rather close
But that night...

10:39.973 --> 10:41.841
she'd apparently forgotten me

10:46.279 --> 10:47.814
Have we really met before?

10:50.550 --> 10:53.887
How could you forget?

10:53.887 --> 10:56.322
You said I looked like
your late boyfriend

10:56.322 --> 10:57.891
You taught me the cha-cha

11:09.602 --> 11:10.937
Go on...

11:17.177 --> 11:19.112
You were always
dragging me to the casino

11:20.880 --> 11:24.384
You'd hit a losing streak
You owed a fortune

11:25.885 --> 11:28.588
My friends and I paid
for your passage to Hong Kong

11:31.024 --> 11:33.193
You talked
a lot about your late boyfriend

11:34.561 --> 11:38.831
A Chinese Filipino from a rich family

11:40.400 --> 11:44.070
You planned to marry him
But he died young

11:45.805 --> 11:47.874
You said he was the love of your life

11:51.244 --> 11:52.712
I shouldn't bring back sad memories...

11:54.948 --> 11:56.849
at this time of year

11:58.718 --> 12:00.420
But do you remember that
Christmas night we went drinking?

12:17.237 --> 12:20.540
We talked a lot

12:20.540 --> 12:23.910
Was she just pretending
she'd forgotten me?

12:25.845 --> 12:28.781
I took her back to her hotel.
She was dead to the world

12:47.934 --> 12:52.005
She'd had too much to drink
so I left quickly

13:21.567 --> 13:25.004
On my way out, I noticed
a very familiar number

13:27.740 --> 13:31.010
If I hadn't run into her that night,
I wouldn't have seen that number

13:32.145 --> 13:35.648
and I wouldn't have written '2046'

13:45.725 --> 13:47.527
Can I help you?

13:47.527 --> 13:49.162
Is Miss Lulu in'?

13:49.162 --> 13:52.732
Lulu?
There's no Miss Lulu here

13:52.732 --> 13:56.002
There was a Mimi...
but she's moved out

13:57.070 --> 13:59.505
But I was here two days ago!

13:59.505 --> 14:01.607
Do you know where she's gone?

14:01.607 --> 14:04.844
No!
What do you want with her?

14:04.844 --> 14:06.879
Nothing, really

14:06.879 --> 14:09.782
I have her key
I wanted to return it

14:09.782 --> 14:12.218
You can give it to me

14:12.218 --> 14:13.252
Thanks

14:18.157 --> 14:20.727
You want to rent the room?

14:20.727 --> 14:23.463
I'm just back from abroad
I don't have my own place yet

14:23.463 --> 14:25.932
If the room's vacant,
I could take a look

14:25.932 --> 14:28.301
This is just a small hotel

14:28.301 --> 14:31.738
But our residents are
all decent people

14:31.738 --> 14:33.473
What's your line of work?

14:33.473 --> 14:34.874
I write for newspapers

14:36.075 --> 14:40.046
Great! A fellow artist!

14:40.046 --> 14:41.981
I haven't always done this

14:41.981 --> 14:44.317
I used to be an artist too

14:44.317 --> 14:45.118
Really?

14:45.118 --> 14:48.254
I took singing lessons, in Harbin

14:48.254 --> 14:51.057
Back then, I was a tenor

14:51.057 --> 14:54.093
<i>It'll</i> be a pleasure to have you here

14:54.093 --> 14:55.828
When will you move in?

14:55.828 --> 14:58.664
As soon as possible

14:58.664 --> 15:02.435
But 2046 has to be redecorated

15:02.435 --> 15:05.505
2047 is vacant
Take a look at it

15:13.146 --> 15:16.015
Never mind
I'll come back when it's ready

15:17.650 --> 15:19.685
Why that particular room?

15:21.020 --> 15:23.256
Maybe it's the number

15:23.256 --> 15:25.491
It has some significance for you?

15:25.491 --> 15:27.660
I'm joking

15:27.660 --> 15:30.730
Tell you what
Take a quick look at 2047

15:30.730 --> 15:33.366
If it's okay, you can move in

15:33.366 --> 15:37.804
Then switch to 2046 when it's ready

15:37.804 --> 15:38.971
How about it?

15:42.375 --> 15:44.043
Can I see the room?

15:44.043 --> 15:45.411
Of course! Please

16:02.762 --> 16:05.465
Once I moved in...

16:05.465 --> 16:09.902
I found out what had happened
the night before

16:11.637 --> 16:14.440
Lulu was stabbed by a jealous
boyfriend. A drummer from the club

16:14.440 --> 16:16.776
She'd really liked him...

16:16.776 --> 16:20.213
and compared him with a bird
that could never land

16:20.213 --> 16:22.915
For all these years...

16:22.915 --> 16:26.118
She has been looking for
her 'legless bird'

16:26.118 --> 16:28.688
Most of her affairs ended badly

16:28.688 --> 16:30.122
But she didn't mind sad endings

16:31.357 --> 16:35.528
No matter what happened at least
she was always the leading lady

17:22.909 --> 17:23.843
Good!

17:25.944 --> 17:27.146
Sure!

17:28.614 --> 17:29.749
Go!

17:32.285 --> 17:33.553
Let's go!

17:35.721 --> 17:38.224
Let's go!

17:39.792 --> 17:41.894
<i>I'll</i> go with you!

17:41.894 --> 17:43.396
Good, <i>I'll</i> go with you!
Sure!

17:45.798 --> 17:47.300
I understand!

17:49.101 --> 17:53.172
You know what I mean?
I know... I understand

17:54.473 --> 17:55.741
I got it!

17:59.378 --> 18:01.180
Can I go?

18:03.449 --> 18:05.284
I can go!

18:05.284 --> 18:06.185
Sure!

18:08.154 --> 18:10.456
I understand!

18:10.456 --> 18:12.792
Got it!

18:17.830 --> 18:21.934
It didn't take long to finish
redecorating 2046

18:21.934 --> 18:25.104
But by then I was used to 2047

18:25.104 --> 18:26.272
Sure!

18:26.272 --> 18:29.408
I started hearing a strange voice
through the wall

18:29.408 --> 18:32.311
I thought someone had moved in

18:32.311 --> 18:33.679
But it was the daughter
of the hotel owner, Mr Wang

18:37.083 --> 18:37.984
Definitely!

18:39.318 --> 18:40.820
I'm definitely going!

18:42.455 --> 18:45.625
Okay, let's go!

19:03.876 --> 19:05.945
I had no idea what she was saying

19:09.248 --> 19:11.951
The bell-hop told me
it was Japanese

19:14.220 --> 19:16.956
It seems she had a Japanese boyfriend

19:18.090 --> 19:22.161
Tell the driver “220 Granville Road”

19:22.161 --> 19:25.364
- Ga...ran...wai...
- 220 Granville Road

19:25.364 --> 19:26.966
Turn from Humphreys Avenue,

19:26.966 --> 19:29.268
- near to Kimberley Road
- Can you say again?

19:29.268 --> 19:31.671
- Don't turn down Salisbury Road
- Slowly, please...

19:31.671 --> 19:34.974
- <i>I'll</i> draw you a map
- That's my pen!

19:34.974 --> 19:37.843
I'll repeat it once more
Turn from Humphreys Avenue

19:37.843 --> 19:41.447
Near to Kimberley Road
But don't turn down Salisbury Road

19:41.447 --> 19:43.182
Understand?

19:43.182 --> 19:46.285
<i>I'll</i> draw you a map

19:46.285 --> 19:49.455
Granville Road
Turn from Humphreys Avenue

19:49.455 --> 19:51.057
Don't turn down Salisbury Road

19:52.792 --> 19:54.560
Remember, don't turn
down Salisbury Road

20:03.836 --> 20:07.306
His company in Japan had sent
him to Hong Kong

20:07.306 --> 20:10.443
When he got here,
he checked into this hotel

20:12.078 --> 20:13.979
The world is full of men!

20:13.979 --> 20:16.716
Why do you have to choose a Japanese?

20:16.716 --> 20:20.920
Get rid of him!
I will never meet him!

20:20.920 --> 20:24.757
You want my blessing?
Not while I'm alive!

20:27.493 --> 20:31.430
It had been going on for ages

20:31.430 --> 20:33.032
So they had to break up

21:09.502 --> 21:12.571
Can you tell me what you feel?

21:17.743 --> 21:20.045
Do you like me?

21:22.848 --> 21:24.083
Or not?

21:29.655 --> 21:32.091
I'm scared to hear your answer

21:40.466 --> 21:42.601
But I have to ask anyway

22:05.324 --> 22:06.859
Leave with me

22:48.033 --> 22:49.168
Goodbye

23:08.520 --> 23:11.090
The man finally went back to Japan

23:12.524 --> 23:17.496
That's when Miss Wang
began talking to herself

23:44.990 --> 23:48.594
Hey, ask your boss to turn it a bit!

23:48.594 --> 23:51.030
Mr Chow, you'd better ask him yourself

23:55.701 --> 23:59.371
Hasn't he left already?
Why is he back?

23:59.371 --> 24:03.142
I will not see him!
If you won't give him up...

24:03.142 --> 24:06.211
Get out!
Go away with him!

24:09.882 --> 24:14.186
I assumed that Mr Wang played it
so loud because he loved his opera

24:14.186 --> 24:17.656
Actually he didn't want anyone
to overhear the family row

25:09.708 --> 25:10.609
What are you doing?

25:21.653 --> 25:23.088
Come back for me
when you're a little older!

25:26.325 --> 25:27.960
I said, wait till you grow up!

25:32.531 --> 25:33.665
I like it

25:35.868 --> 25:39.905
Mr Wang thought about very little
but his two daughters

25:39.905 --> 25:42.074
The elder one was crazy
about her Japanese man

25:42.074 --> 25:44.043
The younger one was precocious
for her age

25:44.043 --> 25:46.945
She kept coming into my room
for drinks

25:46.945 --> 25:50.015
Then she ran off with some man

25:50.015 --> 25:53.485
Another drummer from a club band,
I heard

25:53.485 --> 25:56.522
After she left,
her elder sister got into trouble too

25:56.522 --> 25:59.792
Hey, have a word with your boss for me
I'm a bit late with the rent

25:59.792 --> 26:01.994
Anyway, he has my deposit

26:01.994 --> 26:06.265
Mr Chow, tell him yourself
He's in a foul mood these clays

26:06.265 --> 26:08.067
What's eating him?

26:08.067 --> 26:11.503
First, one daughter ran away
Now the other one's in hospital

26:11.503 --> 26:14.106
- That's why he's so angry
- Why is she in hospital?

26:14.106 --> 26:16.942
He wouldn't say,
he was quite strange...

26:16.942 --> 26:19.745
- Steer clear of him!
- So, that's it?

26:20.712 --> 26:23.682
Anyhow, give him my invitation
It's my father's birthday banquet

26:23.682 --> 26:26.351
He can deduct
his gift from the rent I owe

26:28.253 --> 26:32.825
Later they imposed
a curfew in Hong Kong

26:32.825 --> 26:38.730
Home-made bombs caused panic
The economy stopped dead

26:38.730 --> 26:43.168
I stopped going out Some thought
I was a reformed character

26:43.168 --> 26:45.904
Actually, I was writing

26:45.904 --> 26:47.973
A story called 2046

26:47.973 --> 26:50.242
All about men and women
looking for love

26:50.242 --> 26:53.078
risking everything to get to a
place called 2046

26:53.078 --> 26:53.946
What's that?

26:54.713 --> 26:59.518
Let's go to

26:59.518 --> 27:03.188
I made it as bizarre and erotic
as possible, without crossing the line

27:03.188 --> 27:06.024
The readers liked it

27:06.024 --> 27:10.295
Some didn't take to the
science-fiction angle

27:10.295 --> 27:14.233
But all '2046' meant to me was
the number of a hotel room

27:17.169 --> 27:22.040
I made up the whole thing. But some of
my own experiences found their way into it

29:45.284 --> 29:49.554
People I ran into in the normal course
of things turned up in my stories

29:49.554 --> 29:52.524
I felt more and more at ease
in my fictional world

30:02.501 --> 30:06.071
Around that time, Mr. Wang's
music got louder again

30:07.172 --> 30:09.107
More trouble with his two daughters

30:09.107 --> 30:11.243
But also because of the bad
state of the economy

30:11.243 --> 30:14.079
A lot of the rooms were empty

30:14.079 --> 30:17.449
Then in September, the rioting ended

30:17.449 --> 30:19.351
Life went back to normal

30:25.257 --> 30:29.461
Soon, someone moved into 2046

30:36.768 --> 30:38.837
Have you nearly finished?

30:38.837 --> 30:41.073
It's too early in the day for that!

30:41.073 --> 30:42.908
Some of us are trying to sleep!

31:39.398 --> 31:40.532
Peeking?

31:41.933 --> 31:44.636
The woman next door is quite a dish!
What are my chances?

31:44.636 --> 31:47.205
You're off your head!

31:47.205 --> 31:49.007
A father-to-be shouldn't
have that on his mind!

31:49.007 --> 31:51.610
Now she's pregnant
My wife won't let me touch her!

31:51.610 --> 31:53.478
Come on

31:56.214 --> 31:57.482
Put in a word for me

31:57.482 --> 31:59.184
<i>Okay</i>

31:59.184 --> 32:02.120
- How much'?
- How much have you got?

32:04.222 --> 32:06.591
- Only $100
- Wait for my call

32:06.591 --> 32:09.428
Mr Chow!

32:10.395 --> 32:12.431
Mr Chow, a call for you!

32:12.431 --> 32:14.766
Bright and early, huh?

32:14.766 --> 32:18.370
She's not up yet

32:18.370 --> 32:22.140
Why come over?
I told you. It has to be arranged

32:22.140 --> 32:26.311
She's not some streetwalker!
A fellow artist like you

32:26.311 --> 32:29.347
Show her a little respect, will you?

32:31.349 --> 32:33.051
Yes, I'll tell you right away!

32:35.587 --> 32:37.556
Miss Bai, your key

32:38.590 --> 32:39.591
You're back, Miss Bai

32:50.569 --> 32:51.403
Who is it'?

32:53.305 --> 32:56.508
- Who are you looking for?
- Mr Chow suggested I come by...

32:57.442 --> 32:59.110
You're back, Mr Chow

33:00.111 --> 33:02.848
- Did you win on the dogs?
- I lost!

33:02.848 --> 33:04.282
I won a little

33:26.137 --> 33:27.072
Looking for me?

33:31.576 --> 33:33.845
I think you know this person?

33:35.647 --> 33:38.750
- What are doing in that room?
- You said you'd arrange it!

33:38.750 --> 33:41.753
- I paid you!
- When did I say it was this room?

33:41.753 --> 33:43.655
- I said that room
- I said this one

33:43.655 --> 33:46.525
- Your girl's in that room
- How embarrassing!

33:46.525 --> 33:48.126
- I told you, the room on the left!
- Please excuse him

33:48.126 --> 33:50.629
Shut up!

33:54.399 --> 33:56.001
Who is it'?

34:01.439 --> 34:03.408
9h, you again!

34:03.408 --> 34:06.978
I just wanted to apologize
for last night

34:06.978 --> 34:09.047
Forget it

34:16.987 --> 34:20.625
Ping, my editor, was out of line
But he's not really so bad

34:20.625 --> 34:22.427
Just a bit stingy!

34:22.427 --> 34:26.665
Never pays his way! Always says
he's broke when the check arrives

34:26.665 --> 34:30.068
So I thought I'd play a trick on him

34:30.068 --> 34:34.005
At my expense?
Didn't you go a bit far?

34:35.607 --> 34:37.442
He only fell for it because
you're so beautiful

34:39.643 --> 34:41.246
You're quite a flirt!

34:42.112 --> 34:43.782
Just stating the fact!

34:45.183 --> 34:46.784
A small token of apology...

34:48.485 --> 34:51.623
Please accept it

34:51.623 --> 34:53.792
I don't want it

34:53.792 --> 34:57.596
You're still cross, aren't you?

34:57.596 --> 34:59.464
- Please accept it
- No!

34:59.464 --> 35:00.865
- Come on...
- No!

35:00.865 --> 35:02.334
It's just a token...

35:04.703 --> 35:07.939
Don't make fun of me,
I mean what I say!

35:07.939 --> 35:09.007
Now, get out!

35:13.845 --> 35:17.282
That's good, let it all out

35:17.282 --> 35:20.352
How can I make you feel better?
Slap me again!

35:20.352 --> 35:23.955
Think I wouldn't dare?
Come closer!

35:29.694 --> 35:30.762
Bastard!

35:39.504 --> 35:41.473
Don't be so petty!

35:41.473 --> 35:43.708
That's enough

35:43.708 --> 35:47.078
I'm courteous enough
not to slap you again

35:47.078 --> 35:48.613
That doesn't mean
you can take advantage!

35:51.182 --> 35:54.886
This time I'll give you face

35:54.886 --> 35:58.223
If there's ever a next time,
<i>I'll</i> be less polite

35:58.223 --> 36:00.592
It won't happen again

36:00.592 --> 36:03.194
My face is still numb

36:03.194 --> 36:05.430
- Accept it!
- No!

36:06.765 --> 36:09.801
They're just a token of my regard

36:09.801 --> 36:12.871
I chose them myself

36:12.871 --> 36:14.439
See if you like them

36:15.707 --> 36:17.442
If you don't, just throw them away

36:19.377 --> 36:20.545
Good

36:36.561 --> 36:37.529
I'll leave now

36:55.313 --> 36:58.349
Calm down!

37:00.585 --> 37:04.689
It's none of your business
who I dated last night!

37:07.158 --> 37:07.892
Who?

37:10.095 --> 37:10.962
Dabao!

37:13.331 --> 37:15.133
Which Dabao?

37:16.000 --> 37:18.870
The fat one or the skinny one?

37:18.870 --> 37:21.673
From Shanghai or from Shandong?

37:21.673 --> 37:27.345
The trouble is,
I know so many men named Dabao

37:30.582 --> 37:33.852
How should I know which one you mean?

37:36.755 --> 37:39.557
Yes, I did

37:44.629 --> 37:46.097
Let me just say...

37:47.398 --> 37:51.436
Get out!
You think I can accept this?

37:51.436 --> 37:55.273
Her or me
You'd better choose!

37:55.273 --> 37:56.141
Now get out!

38:32.544 --> 38:36.681
24 December 1967

39:05.410 --> 39:09.948
You're back early!
It's Christmas!

39:09.948 --> 39:11.549
Shouldn't you be having dinner
with your boyfriend?

39:15.720 --> 39:18.189
What boyfriend?

39:18.189 --> 39:21.893
Then let's have supper!

39:21.893 --> 39:24.462
You have so many girlfriends!
You need company?

39:24.462 --> 39:25.563
Go out with them!

39:28.499 --> 39:31.002
They all want to be with me,
but I can't choose

39:31.002 --> 39:32.537
The fairest thing is to see none of them

39:34.272 --> 39:37.942
Come on, no point in staying
cooped up in your room

39:37.942 --> 39:39.277
I'm not in a good mood tonight

39:40.712 --> 39:44.916
I might get drunk...
and slap you again

39:47.485 --> 39:51.522
That's okay
I'm used to it!

39:51.522 --> 39:54.158
If slapping me
would make you happy

39:55.727 --> 39:57.996
take that as my Christmas present!

39:57.996 --> 40:00.398
Come on

40:00.398 --> 40:01.366
Come with me

40:02.433 --> 40:04.602
Let go!

40:28.459 --> 40:32.230
I didn't expect to spend Christmas
like this

40:32.230 --> 40:33.665
What were you expecting?

40:36.768 --> 40:41.506
We'd made plans
He was taking me to Singapore

40:43.675 --> 40:45.643
He says it's warm there at Christmas

40:52.050 --> 40:54.719
So I didn't even pack winter clothes

40:56.154 --> 40:58.222
What I'm wearing now...

40:59.524 --> 41:00.825
is for summer!

41:08.466 --> 41:10.201
Have you been to Singapore?

41:13.204 --> 41:15.440
I worked there for several years

41:19.477 --> 41:21.779
What kind of work?

41:21.779 --> 41:22.914
On a newspaper

41:25.950 --> 41:27.385
Is it fun there?

41:29.420 --> 41:30.388
It's okay

41:35.660 --> 41:36.995
Tell me more

41:38.730 --> 41:42.767
I won't be going
So <i>I'll</i> just have to imagine it

41:48.873 --> 41:49.941
What do you want to know?

41:57.315 --> 41:58.816
How's the climate?

42:02.854 --> 42:05.490
Pretty warm

42:05.490 --> 42:06.924
All year round

42:08.126 --> 42:10.094
Sometimes you can't tell
what season it is

42:13.564 --> 42:15.033
The food stalls are great!

42:16.401 --> 42:19.771
Ping and I ate there after work

42:19.771 --> 42:22.040
We'd eat and drink till dawn

42:28.579 --> 42:31.149
Our landlord was a funny man

42:31.149 --> 42:34.852
Short and fat,
and he always wore a skirt

42:34.852 --> 42:37.321
What the Malays call a 'sarong'

42:40.658 --> 42:43.861
But when you're away from home

42:43.861 --> 42:45.196
it sometimes gets boring

42:56.474 --> 42:58.509
That was a dull meal!

42:59.477 --> 43:00.478
Another drink somewhere else?

43:02.413 --> 43:03.915
You really like to drink?

43:05.416 --> 43:07.418
It makes things easy

43:07.418 --> 43:09.821
When I'm drunk, I have no worries!

43:11.456 --> 43:16.461
Won't your girlfriends
be missing you tonight?

43:16.461 --> 43:20.264
They're not stuck to me!
They see other men too

43:20.264 --> 43:24.235
We just have fun together
They still need to make a living!

43:26.671 --> 43:31.976
I don't get it
Where does all that 'fun' get you?

43:31.976 --> 43:35.780
If you find the right person
why waste time on the others?

43:35.780 --> 43:38.049
If I find the right person!

43:38.049 --> 43:41.119
A man like me has nothing much
except free time

43:41.919 --> 43:45.490
That's why I need company

43:45.490 --> 43:47.458
So people are
just time-fillers to you?

43:47.458 --> 43:49.293
I wouldn't say that

43:50.194 --> 43:52.063
Other people can borrow my time too

43:55.099 --> 43:57.635
And this evening?

43:57.635 --> 44:00.171
Are you borrowing me
or am I borrowing you?

44:00.171 --> 44:02.140
No difference!

44:02.140 --> 44:06.077
Maybe I borrowed you earlier
and now you're borrowing me

44:06.077 --> 44:07.478
Ridiculous!

44:11.849 --> 44:13.651
Don't get me wrong

44:15.086 --> 44:17.588
I don't intend to take advantage of you

44:18.956 --> 44:21.492
If that was what I wanted
I had plenty of options

44:22.894 --> 44:26.797
I just want us to be drinking pals

44:26.797 --> 44:28.166
Is that okay?

44:30.568 --> 44:33.738
It's hard
But <i>I'll</i> give it a try

44:36.607 --> 44:37.675
<i>Okay</i>

44:39.110 --> 44:40.478
Let's try!

44:45.082 --> 44:46.551
- Where to?
- Let's drink!

46:17.842 --> 46:20.111
Mr Chow, you seem happy tonight!

46:20.111 --> 46:23.581
I certainly am, my friends
are buying me dinner

46:23.581 --> 46:24.382
This way please

46:27.184 --> 46:31.289
- Ping! Is it someone's birthday?
- Better than that!

46:31.289 --> 46:34.525
Chow has a new girlfriend!

46:34.525 --> 46:36.427
Definitely worth celebrating!

46:36.427 --> 46:38.296
Mr Chow, what would you like
to eat tonight?

46:38.296 --> 46:40.831
Something expensive!

46:40.831 --> 46:44.502
Snake?

46:44.502 --> 46:46.037
- Yes, snake would be good
- Snake isn't cheap. Can you afford it?

46:46.037 --> 46:48.739
Shut up!
Don't mind him

46:48.739 --> 46:51.375
- What'll it be, Mr Chow?
- Snake!

46:51.375 --> 46:52.677
And a lamb casserole too

46:53.911 --> 46:55.946
- And bring Hoi's whiskey
- Yes! Good!

47:12.296 --> 47:15.232
Can't let this go to waste,
it's delicious

47:15.232 --> 47:19.070
Where's your girl, Chow?
It's already <i>2</i> a.m.

47:19.070 --> 47:20.137
Is she coming?

47:20.137 --> 47:23.474
- She can't be coming
- I don't think she's coming

47:23.474 --> 47:25.776
It's all your fault

47:25.776 --> 47:28.479
It's because of you that
this happened

47:28.479 --> 47:31.682
Why blame me?
You brought this on yourself

47:31.682 --> 47:34.652
You said she was gentle and obedient

47:34.652 --> 47:36.020
Now we know the truth!

47:37.121 --> 47:42.126
I said she was sometimes obedient
and sometimes gentle

47:42.126 --> 47:43.661
But she's full of surprises,
that's part of the fun

47:43.661 --> 47:46.664
So, what next?

47:46.664 --> 47:50.501
- Yes, what now?
- Whatever you feel like doing

47:55.673 --> 47:56.674
And then what happened?

47:58.376 --> 47:59.410
Tell me!

48:04.782 --> 48:07.151
How are you going to thank me?

48:12.490 --> 48:13.224
Pervert!

48:21.065 --> 48:24.168
- Open up!
- Who is it?

48:24.168 --> 48:25.536
Open the door!

48:28.339 --> 48:29.673
It's late

48:31.142 --> 48:33.978
You played a fine joke on me tonight

48:33.978 --> 48:39.150
I finished work late
Too late to get there

48:39.150 --> 48:40.618
So I didn't come

48:44.221 --> 48:45.289
What's this?

48:45.289 --> 48:49.627
That's your fault too

48:49.627 --> 48:52.630
How could I know you'd stand me up?

48:52.630 --> 48:55.833
I thought I'd win a few hundred

48:55.833 --> 49:01.172
Instead I lost my moustache
This is all your fault

49:01.172 --> 49:04.408
You deserved it

49:04.408 --> 49:05.976
Who pushed you into the bet?

49:08.078 --> 49:12.650
<i>I'll</i> tell you something
Ping asked me not to show up

49:12.650 --> 49:16.954
Anyhow I wasn't that
fond of the moustache

49:18.823 --> 49:21.225
You look younger now

49:22.026 --> 49:23.661
Don't you like it?

49:25.429 --> 49:28.265
You're making fun of me!

49:28.265 --> 49:29.533
You tricked me!

49:33.103 --> 49:37.341
I'll get you for this

49:37.341 --> 49:40.010
How will you make it up to me?

49:40.010 --> 49:41.979
At least give me a kiss

49:44.982 --> 49:47.418
- You bit me!
- Come and get me!

49:50.154 --> 49:52.256
You're in for it when I catch you!

49:55.526 --> 49:57.928
Don't touch me there!

50:14.578 --> 50:17.214
You fool

50:17.214 --> 50:19.850
are you going to peel my skin off?

50:19.850 --> 50:22.386
You think you are being merciful?

50:22.386 --> 50:24.588
I am bleeding

50:25.656 --> 50:29.260
I wonder if the weather matters

50:31.128 --> 50:32.429
Just a lamb casserole and I am like this

50:34.698 --> 50:36.333
Do you think I've gone wild?

50:40.104 --> 50:42.273
- What?
- Don't move!

50:44.308 --> 50:47.077
- What are you doing?
- Shaving you

50:47.077 --> 50:49.113
Don't!

50:49.113 --> 50:52.216
Who knows where that shaver's been?

50:52.216 --> 50:53.751
It could bring me bad luck

51:01.125 --> 51:03.193
Let's go for Round Two!

51:30.120 --> 51:31.255
Why are you dressed?

51:36.093 --> 51:38.896
I'm going back to my room...

51:44.101 --> 51:47.471
I'm exhausted
This is all I have

51:47.471 --> 51:49.607
Aside from loose change for the bus

51:49.607 --> 51:51.775
Here's $200

51:53.911 --> 51:57.181
- Please take it
- I don't want it

51:57.181 --> 51:59.283
I wasn't selling

51:59.283 --> 52:01.885
That's not how I meant it

52:01.885 --> 52:05.522
I want to pay for your torn dress

52:05.522 --> 52:06.624
Please take it

52:10.194 --> 52:11.328
I see...

52:12.963 --> 52:14.665
You're afraid I'll cling to you,
is that it?

52:20.404 --> 52:23.507
Fine
I'll take $10

52:24.408 --> 52:25.976
Think of it as a discount rate

52:29.813 --> 52:33.717
If you ever want to come over again
I'll charge the same

55:11.241 --> 55:12.442
I'm going back to my room

55:41.338 --> 55:42.506
Come here

56:13.203 --> 56:14.371
Not tonight

56:16.173 --> 56:17.140
Why not?

56:18.308 --> 56:22.346
Not in the mood?

56:22.346 --> 56:25.716
Can't take the strain tonight

56:25.716 --> 56:28.719
Anyhow, I'm a bit short of cash

56:28.719 --> 56:35.125
Never mind, you can owe me

56:36.526 --> 56:37.261
No

56:38.495 --> 56:40.264
I don't like being in debt

57:00.817 --> 57:02.986
The reception's at 6, dinner at 8.

57:02.986 --> 57:05.188
I don't mind if you can't make it,
just send your gift

57:06.156 --> 57:09.192
No more than you do!
You hold banquets all year round!

57:09.192 --> 57:12.262
I've had four birthday
invitations from you this year!

57:12.262 --> 57:14.765
I'll send over some more
invitation cards later

57:14.765 --> 57:17.467
Think of people with money... Write in
their names and send them invitations!

57:17.467 --> 57:18.368
Okay, that's settled

57:19.536 --> 57:20.904
Mr Chow, holding another banquet?

57:21.672 --> 57:24.074
You know we have birthdays
in different calendars?

57:24.074 --> 57:25.676
Another of mine has come around

57:25.676 --> 57:27.077
No doubt

57:27.077 --> 57:30.380
- Here's one for your boss
- Alright

57:30.380 --> 57:35.085
Tell him that since we're so close...
He can deduct his gift from the rent I owe

57:35.085 --> 57:37.187
- Make sure he gets it
- Okay

57:42.225 --> 57:43.961
It's late, what's so urgent?

57:43.961 --> 57:47.798
Just got back from Macau
Chow asked me to bring you a present

57:50.467 --> 57:52.135
- You two went to Macau?
- Yes,

57:52.135 --> 57:55.138
we had some days off
So we went to the casino

58:01.445 --> 58:03.981
Oh, it's beautiful

58:03.981 --> 58:08.218
He says he found some money...
in his pocket

58:08.218 --> 58:11.855
So before losing it all at the tables

58:11.855 --> 58:13.423
he bought you a present

58:15.058 --> 58:18.095
- Where is he?
- Not back yet...

58:18.095 --> 58:22.165
You know what he's like
Extravagant at the start of the month

58:22.165 --> 58:23.734
and broke well before the end

58:23.734 --> 58:28.638
He made several thousand hosting that
party. So now he's really enjoying himself!

58:28.638 --> 58:31.074
- Is he there alone?
- Of course not!

58:31.074 --> 58:36.113
There's a gang of them
He likes company

58:36.113 --> 58:37.481
Was he always like this?

58:37.481 --> 58:39.583
Let's not talk about him,
let's have a drink

58:45.088 --> 58:49.626
But I should warn you...
I know you like Chow a lot

58:49.626 --> 58:53.296
Don't waste your time on him
He's not serious!

59:13.316 --> 59:14.751
Guess who?

59:15.919 --> 59:18.989
There's only one possibility!

59:18.989 --> 59:21.091
Let me have a bite first!

59:28.665 --> 59:30.400
What are you doing here?

59:33.870 --> 59:37.407
What am I doing here?
What do you think?

01:00:09.706 --> 01:00:12.909
I thought I was pretty wild

01:00:12.909 --> 01:00:16.012
But you're much wilder!

01:00:16.012 --> 01:00:17.114
Pay up!

01:00:18.782 --> 01:00:22.219
I haven't seen you for ages

01:00:22.219 --> 01:00:23.854
I've been busy

01:00:24.554 --> 01:00:26.556
Liar

01:00:26.556 --> 01:00:30.160
Tell me the truth

01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:32.028
lam!

01:00:35.332 --> 01:00:39.603
Who was that woman the other clay?

01:00:39.603 --> 01:00:41.004
What woman?

01:00:42.172 --> 01:00:43.473
Don't pretend

01:00:45.742 --> 01:00:49.546
I saw her leaving your room

01:00:49.546 --> 01:00:52.048
Who is she?

01:00:52.048 --> 01:00:54.451
- A friend
- A friend?

01:00:57.888 --> 01:01:00.891
What was she doing in your room?

01:01:00.891 --> 01:01:03.226
Don't be nosy, alright?

01:01:03.226 --> 01:01:07.330
Go back to your room
I have work to do

01:01:11.501 --> 01:01:13.570
I won't!

01:01:14.437 --> 01:01:16.473
I'm sleeping here tonight

01:01:17.707 --> 01:01:19.442
An overnight stay is expensive

01:01:19.442 --> 01:01:23.580
No problem
Name your price

01:01:24.147 --> 01:01:27.384
I'd pay anything to be with you.
Every day

01:01:29.452 --> 01:01:33.323
Retail is fine
Wholesale is out of the question

01:01:33.323 --> 01:01:34.758
Why?

01:01:34.758 --> 01:01:36.760
I just don't like it

01:01:38.795 --> 01:01:41.331
Could you make an exception for me?

01:01:41.331 --> 01:01:42.499
No

01:01:45.435 --> 01:01:49.139
You treat all women like this?

01:01:49.139 --> 01:01:51.775
- Except one
- Who?

01:01:51.775 --> 01:01:54.377
- My mother
- I'm serious

01:01:58.148 --> 01:02:01.484
I don't mind you having other women

01:02:01.484 --> 01:02:04.454
But I won't be treated the same as them

01:02:09.392 --> 01:02:12.629
I don't care if you love me or not

01:02:12.629 --> 01:02:15.065
I'll love you anyway

01:02:17.367 --> 01:02:19.836
Since we got together,
I haven't brought other men back

01:02:21.638 --> 01:02:24.007
I hoped you'd think the same way

01:02:26.376 --> 01:02:28.178
Will you promise me that?

01:02:28.178 --> 01:02:30.180
No

01:02:42.392 --> 01:02:43.760
I see...

01:02:45.595 --> 01:02:47.297
Then we're through

01:02:53.136 --> 01:02:56.606
I'll never bother you. And I don't
ever want you in my room again

01:03:01.611 --> 01:03:04.447
Here, $10

01:03:04.447 --> 01:03:05.849
Tonight, I'm paying

01:03:11.054 --> 01:03:14.124
Thank you!

01:03:14.124 --> 01:03:16.760
If you're ever in the mood,
feel free to come over

01:03:18.194 --> 01:03:21.398
I'll charge you the same

01:03:36.579 --> 01:03:39.416
Having fun?

01:03:39.416 --> 01:03:42.252
What do you care'?

01:04:09.446 --> 01:04:12.382
You were rather loud last night

01:04:12.382 --> 01:04:15.185
I meant to be

01:04:15.185 --> 01:04:18.955
You bring back women,
why shouldn't I have men?

01:04:18.955 --> 01:04:21.124
I want to see if you really don't mind

01:04:40.477 --> 01:04:44.414
I won't go,
why don't you come here instead?

01:04:51.121 --> 01:04:52.555
Forget it! Don't come!

01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:17.740
After Bai Ling moved out...
she started dating Dabao

01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:20.143
And I saw other women too

01:06:20.143 --> 01:06:22.679
If our paths ever crossed,
we'd pretend not to see each other

01:06:22.679 --> 01:06:26.549
Rather pathetic, I know. But it was
better for us to end it this way

01:06:27.350 --> 01:06:29.452
I've never seen her since

01:06:29.452 --> 01:06:33.523
But sometimes
she pops up in my stories

01:06:42.999 --> 01:06:45.835
Your change, please check it

01:06:45.835 --> 01:06:46.803
Thank you

01:06:48.404 --> 01:06:50.740
Are you going out later?

01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:51.274
Why?

01:06:53.409 --> 01:06:56.713
Could you post this letter for me?

01:07:01.918 --> 01:07:02.719
Sure

01:07:04.587 --> 01:07:08.858
Then Miss Wang came back. I knew from
the familiar sound coming through the wall

01:07:11.861 --> 01:07:15.198
Please take me with you!

01:07:15.198 --> 01:07:17.267
Good!

01:07:17.267 --> 01:07:18.601
What are you doing?

01:07:18.601 --> 01:07:20.904
Wasn't I clear?

01:07:20.904 --> 01:07:23.039
Don't contact that Japanese man!

01:07:23.039 --> 01:07:25.408
Why are you writing to him in secret?

01:07:25.408 --> 01:07:27.744
Aren't you ashamed?

01:07:27.744 --> 01:07:29.078
Return his letter!

01:07:31.114 --> 01:07:32.015
No?

01:07:58.041 --> 01:07:58.875
What are you reading?

01:08:00.043 --> 01:08:02.378
A martial-arts novel

01:08:02.378 --> 01:08:03.479
You like them?

01:08:12.755 --> 01:08:15.224
If your friend wants to send you
more letters

01:08:15.224 --> 01:08:17.292
and you don't want
your dad to know

01:08:17.292 --> 01:08:20.129
tell him to send them to my room
I'll pass them on to you

01:08:30.139 --> 01:08:33.710
She looked happier when she came
back this time

01:08:33.710 --> 01:08:36.779
We talked more often

01:08:36.779 --> 01:08:39.983
Mr Chow, another letter for you

01:08:42.585 --> 01:08:45.721
Another!

01:08:45.721 --> 01:08:47.756
Those Japanese girls get so
carried away!

01:09:12.281 --> 01:09:14.716
Let's see each other again

01:09:17.987 --> 01:09:22.859
Then, if you still think
we shouldn't be together

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:26.462
tell me so, frankly

01:09:29.966 --> 01:09:31.667
That day, six years ago

01:09:33.435 --> 01:09:37.073
a rainbow appeared in my heart

01:09:37.073 --> 01:09:40.743
It's still there
Like a flame burning inside me

01:09:43.845 --> 01:09:48.151
But what are your real feelings for me?

01:09:49.519 --> 01:09:56.693
Are they like a rainbow after the rain?

01:09:58.561 --> 01:10:00.930
Or...

01:10:03.066 --> 01:10:07.670
did that rainbow fade away long ago?

01:10:12.375 --> 01:10:14.644
I'm waiting for your answer

01:10:27.190 --> 01:10:30.026
Why do you write
all that stuff about sex?

01:10:30.026 --> 01:10:32.695
So I won't starve!

01:10:32.695 --> 01:10:35.798
Don't you worry about
your reputation?

01:10:38.367 --> 01:10:39.469
Maybe I'm not such a nice guy

01:10:41.137 --> 01:10:42.605
Why not try writing something else?

01:10:42.605 --> 01:10:44.874
Who'd read it?

01:10:44.874 --> 01:10:49.045
How about a martial-arts novel?
People love them

01:10:49.045 --> 01:10:51.714
That's too hard

01:10:51.714 --> 01:10:55.551
I tried once,
co-writing it with someone

01:10:55.551 --> 01:10:58.855
We locked ourselves away for months

01:10:58.855 --> 01:11:00.323
Just got sore heads

01:11:01.624 --> 01:11:04.060
Those were good times

01:11:06.195 --> 01:11:08.197
I like writing too

01:11:08.197 --> 01:11:12.001
It's hard to make a living by writing

01:11:12.001 --> 01:11:15.471
I just do it for fun

01:11:15.471 --> 01:11:18.040
- I'll show you some of my stuff
- Please do

01:11:27.150 --> 01:11:30.253
Here you are, read this first

01:11:35.958 --> 01:11:37.994
Wow, you're prolific!

01:11:39.095 --> 01:11:40.997
When you've read it,
tell me what you think

01:11:40.997 --> 01:11:44.901
- Don't forget to give it back!
- Sure!

01:12:06.055 --> 01:12:08.825
- Have you read my story yet?
- I have

01:12:08.825 --> 01:12:10.993
What did you think?

01:12:14.030 --> 01:12:16.132
I think you should
never write another word

01:12:18.234 --> 01:12:20.570
Why not?

01:12:23.506 --> 01:12:27.410
You're so good
You could put me out of work

01:12:33.349 --> 01:12:35.685
“The Spider Sage thrusts out
his right fist!”

01:12:35.685 --> 01:12:36.953
“Two chopsticks take off like rockets!”

01:12:37.486 --> 01:12:40.656
“They land with explosive force!”

01:12:40.656 --> 01:12:42.491
“Kaboom! The mountain splits apart!”

01:12:42.491 --> 01:12:45.094
Slow down, I can't keep up

01:12:45.561 --> 01:12:47.363
Come on, they're waiting for it

01:12:47.363 --> 01:12:48.998
Alright, alright

01:12:48.998 --> 01:12:51.300
Caught up'?

01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:52.435
Go on

01:12:53.035 --> 01:12:57.273
- Where was I?
- “The mountain splits apart”

01:12:57.273 --> 01:12:59.709
Right...
“The mountain splits apart

01:12:59.709 --> 01:13:01.477
“smashing Iron Abacus to the ground!”

01:13:01.477 --> 01:13:03.779
Iron Abacus?

01:13:03.779 --> 01:13:05.348
Isn't he dead?

01:13:08.351 --> 01:13:12.121
Is he?
Then make it Iron Head

01:13:12.121 --> 01:13:14.557
Where did Iron Head
come from all of a sudden?

01:13:14.557 --> 01:13:17.393
Hey, anything goes
in martial-arts novels!

01:13:18.928 --> 01:13:23.466
Why don't you get some rest?
<i>I'll</i> finish it for you

01:13:23.466 --> 01:13:24.333
<i>Okay</i>

01:13:33.843 --> 01:13:36.612
It felt like having an assistant

01:13:36.612 --> 01:13:41.784
When I was late with my copy,
I asked her to ghost it for me

01:13:41.784 --> 01:13:46.289
She was just a girl but she could
write as raunchily as the best of us

01:13:48.224 --> 01:13:49.725
We got along very well

01:13:51.627 --> 01:13:54.497
That was my happiest summer ever

01:13:57.366 --> 01:13:58.701
But it didn't last...

01:14:15.952 --> 01:14:19.322
I encouraged her
to face up to her father

01:14:19.322 --> 01:14:21.791
But she didn't dare

01:14:21.791 --> 01:14:24.560
She wanted to pay her own way

01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:28.731
So I got herjob
in the cloakroom at a club

01:14:28.731 --> 01:14:29.398
Thanks!

01:14:31.767 --> 01:14:34.870
She told her father

01:14:34.870 --> 01:14:36.505
she was going out with me

01:14:45.348 --> 01:14:49.552
Sometimes I found an excuse to
pick her up after work

01:14:49.552 --> 01:14:53.089
- You're here late
- If you're ready to go,

01:14:53.089 --> 01:14:57.059
I have a taxi waiting
I can give you a lift back

01:15:01.597 --> 01:15:02.598
No thanks

01:15:07.670 --> 01:15:10.206
Then I won't wait

01:15:32.695 --> 01:15:35.297
Feelings can creep up
on you unawares

01:15:37.533 --> 01:15:39.301
I knew that, but did she?

01:15:44.807 --> 01:15:48.577
She was always asking if there was
anything at all that never changed

01:15:50.012 --> 01:15:51.981
I could see what was on her mind

01:15:53.149 --> 01:15:56.819
I promised to write a story for her,
based on my observation

01:15:56.819 --> 01:16:00.056
Something to show her
what her boyfriend was thinking

01:16:00.056 --> 01:16:04.460
As a joke
we thought of calling it '2047'

01:16:11.801 --> 01:16:14.236
But maybe I was being too oblique

01:16:14.236 --> 01:16:18.340
I'd begun to feel that it wasn't
about her boyfriend at all

01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:19.875
Rather it was more about me

01:16:50.039 --> 01:16:52.975
Sol began imagining myself
as a Japanese man

01:16:54.276 --> 01:16:57.780
on a train for 2046

01:16:57.780 --> 01:16:59.915
falling for an android
with delayed reaction

01:17:10.292 --> 01:17:13.195
If someone wants to leave 2046,
how long will it take?

01:17:13.195 --> 01:17:16.365
No one can say

01:17:16.365 --> 01:17:19.301
Some people get away fairly easily

01:17:19.301 --> 01:17:24.106
Others find that
it takes them much longer

01:17:24.106 --> 01:17:26.142
It takes great strength

01:17:26.142 --> 01:17:28.944
And it can hurt terribly

01:17:28.944 --> 01:17:31.413
I forget how long I've been
on this train

01:17:31.413 --> 01:17:33.315
I start to feel very lonely

01:17:33.315 --> 01:17:36.886
It's rather boring at first

01:17:36.886 --> 01:17:39.321
But you slowly get used to it

01:17:39.321 --> 01:17:43.993
We have a range of cabin attendants
They can satisfy your every need

01:17:43.993 --> 01:17:48.330
They will serve you devotedly
Like an intimate friend

01:17:48.330 --> 01:17:51.367
But you must
never fall in love with them

01:17:51.367 --> 01:17:53.836
Who'd ever fall for an android?

01:17:53.836 --> 01:17:56.939
Who can say?

01:17:56.939 --> 01:18:00.576
Events can creep up on you

01:18:00.576 --> 01:18:03.279
without you even noticing

01:18:03.279 --> 01:18:06.148
It happens all the time

01:18:53.095 --> 01:18:56.265
Paragraph 201 in the Passengers' Guide

01:18:56.265 --> 01:18:59.101
warns that Area 1224-1225

01:18:59.101 --> 01:19:02.204
is especially cold

01:19:02.204 --> 01:19:04.974
The train heating won't be strong enough

01:19:04.974 --> 01:19:09.178
Passengers are advised to hug
each other to keep warm

01:19:09.178 --> 01:19:11.480
Since I'm the only passenger

01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:13.449
I hug my android cabin attendant

01:19:18.621 --> 01:19:23.392
I wonder if it's her mechanism
or just my imagination

01:19:23.392 --> 01:19:25.194
But I sense some responsive warmth
in her artificial body

01:19:34.837 --> 01:19:36.338
Hurts

01:19:38.774 --> 01:19:41.010
Why do you want to leave 2046?

01:19:47.583 --> 01:19:48.817
Do you know
what people did in the old days

01:19:50.586 --> 01:19:55.557
when they had secrets
they didn't want to share?

01:20:02.331 --> 01:20:04.133
They'd climb a mountain

01:20:05.267 --> 01:20:08.137
Find a tree

01:20:08.137 --> 01:20:10.839
Carve a hole in it

01:20:10.839 --> 01:20:15.678
Whisper the secret into the hole

01:20:15.678 --> 01:20:17.246
And cover it up with mud

01:20:19.415 --> 01:20:24.086
That way

01:20:26.488 --> 01:20:32.261
nobody else would ever learn the secret

01:20:45.207 --> 01:20:48.477
I'll be your tree!

01:20:48.477 --> 01:20:51.647
Tell me,
and nobody else will ever know

01:20:57.286 --> 01:20:58.454
I always...

01:21:02.124 --> 01:21:02.858
I always...

01:21:05.361 --> 01:21:06.362
I always...

01:21:12.434 --> 01:21:14.136
Very funny!
I always...

01:21:19.174 --> 01:21:20.509
I always...

01:21:22.478 --> 01:21:26.548
Whenever anyone asked
why I left 2046...

01:21:26.548 --> 01:21:28.117
I always
I gave them some vague answer

01:21:29.818 --> 01:21:30.886
I always...

01:21:35.924 --> 01:21:39.528
I once fell in love with someone

01:21:39.528 --> 01:21:42.498
I couldn't stop wondering
whether she loved me or not

01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:48.871
I found an android
which looked just like her

01:21:48.871 --> 01:21:50.839
I thought the android might
give me the answer

01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:22.097
<i>1O hours later</i>

01:23:52.461 --> 01:23:55.297
I have a secret to tell you

01:23:58.534 --> 01:24:00.669
Leave with me

01:24:08.710 --> 01:24:10.946
I have a secret to tell you

01:24:13.448 --> 01:24:14.783
Leave with me

01:24:21.223 --> 01:24:22.624
I kept on asking

01:24:24.826 --> 01:24:26.428
But she never answered

01:24:29.865 --> 01:24:31.667
I began dreaming up excuses
for her silence

01:24:33.735 --> 01:24:37.339
Do you know the Buddhist canon?

01:24:37.339 --> 01:24:40.509
'The 5 Decays of Celestial Beings'?

01:24:41.877 --> 01:24:45.047
The 5 Decays of Celestial Beings

01:24:45.047 --> 01:24:47.916
It's all about the gods and how
they go through this process too

01:24:47.916 --> 01:24:53.755
Our cabin attendants
are superbly designed

01:24:53.755 --> 01:24:57.059
But there's one problem

01:24:57.059 --> 01:25:00.362
When they've served on
so many long journeys

01:25:00.362 --> 01:25:02.798
fatigue begins to set in

01:25:02.798 --> 01:25:07.002
They might want to laugh

01:25:07.002 --> 01:25:10.405
but the smile would be slow to come

01:25:10.405 --> 01:25:13.108
They might want to cry

01:25:13.108 --> 01:25:18.413
but the tear wouldn't well up
till next day!

01:25:18.413 --> 01:25:21.950
This one is failing fast

01:25:39.968 --> 01:25:42.671
I think you'd better give up

01:25:58.687 --> 01:26:02.858
I grew desperate
I felt like giving up

01:26:05.727 --> 01:26:07.529
But I was soon trying again

01:26:18.573 --> 01:26:21.410
I have a secret to tell you

01:26:22.744 --> 01:26:25.781
Will you leave with me?

01:26:34.289 --> 01:26:38.660
I have a secret to tell you

01:26:52.174 --> 01:26:53.809
Will you leave with me?

01:27:20.669 --> 01:27:25.140
Do you know what people did in the
old days when they had secrets?

01:27:37.252 --> 01:27:41.523
They'd climb a mountain, find a tree

01:27:41.523 --> 01:27:44.059
Carve a hole in it...

01:28:34.376 --> 01:28:37.946
I slowly began to doubt myself

01:28:40.615 --> 01:28:42.150
The reason she didn't answer

01:28:43.351 --> 01:28:45.620
was not simply that
her reactions were delayed

01:28:45.620 --> 01:28:47.722
It's simply that she didn't love me

01:28:49.891 --> 01:28:52.594
So at last I got it

01:28:52.594 --> 01:28:54.396
It's entirely beyond my control

01:28:55.430 --> 01:28:57.232
The only thing left for me

01:28:58.733 --> 01:29:00.035
was to give up

01:29:35.203 --> 01:29:39.474
<i>24 December 1968</i>

01:30:53.949 --> 01:30:56.318
Why are you inviting me
to Christmas dinner?

01:30:56.318 --> 01:30:58.486
You know how much
I'll lose in tips by not working?

01:31:00.388 --> 01:31:02.590
Wouldn't it be awful
to be alone tonight?

01:31:02.590 --> 01:31:06.895
I need company

01:31:08.763 --> 01:31:09.764
That means me?

01:31:16.371 --> 01:31:18.540
Your boyfriend hasn't written in a while

01:31:23.078 --> 01:31:24.646
I told him not to

01:31:26.815 --> 01:31:28.416
Anyway, it's hopeless

01:31:30.251 --> 01:31:31.619
No point waiting for me

01:31:34.756 --> 01:31:37.659
Why is it hopeless?
Go and look for him!

01:31:38.860 --> 01:31:40.295
If you don't,
it really will be hopeless

01:31:45.633 --> 01:31:47.068
My dad will never give his consent

01:32:00.815 --> 01:32:03.618
If you were him...

01:32:03.618 --> 01:32:05.053
what would you be doing tonight?

01:32:08.757 --> 01:32:11.793
Why don't you ask him?
Have you got his phone number?

01:32:31.046 --> 01:32:32.480
I can't hear you

01:32:33.114 --> 01:32:37.652
Can you speak louder?

01:32:39.821 --> 01:32:42.323
I'm already shouting!

01:32:43.792 --> 01:32:46.628
I felt like Santa Claus that night

01:32:48.096 --> 01:32:50.065
I took her to the newspaper office

01:32:50.065 --> 01:32:52.734
and let her make a long-distance
call to her boyfriend

01:32:53.802 --> 01:32:57.539
I was happy
to see her so happy

01:32:59.140 --> 01:33:01.209
In fact, zone 1224-1225...

01:33:02.110 --> 01:33:06.381
meant Christmas Eve
and Christmas Day

01:33:06.381 --> 01:33:09.818
On the night before Christmas many
people need a bit more warmth than usual

01:33:11.719 --> 01:33:14.389
I didn't get that

01:33:16.758 --> 01:33:17.859
Maybe that was for the best

01:34:07.308 --> 01:34:11.379
<i>1O hours later</i>

01:34:11.646 --> 01:34:13.148
I realized...

01:34:14.249 --> 01:34:19.154
the reason the android didn't answer...

01:34:19.154 --> 01:34:21.656
had nothing to do with her
mechanism wearing out

01:34:21.656 --> 01:34:25.293
Nor that she didn't like him

01:34:28.997 --> 01:34:32.934
More likely she already loved someone
else. Soon after that, she went to Japan

01:34:32.934 --> 01:34:38.006
I gave her a copy of my story “2047”

01:34:38.006 --> 01:34:39.374
I hope she read it

01:34:42.577 --> 01:34:46.748
<i>100 hours later</i>

01:34:51.119 --> 01:34:55.323
<i>1000 hours later</i>

01:35:16.177 --> 01:35:17.912
Love is all a matter of timing

01:35:19.914 --> 01:35:22.383
It's no good meeting the right person
too soon or too late

01:35:22.383 --> 01:35:23.952
If I'd lived in another time or place

01:35:36.197 --> 01:35:42.003
my story might have had a
very different ending

01:36:31.319 --> 01:36:34.155
I have to tell you...

01:36:34.155 --> 01:36:37.091
- Yes?
- I'll be away for a couple of days

01:36:37.091 --> 01:36:40.495
Please pay my daughter
this month's rent

01:36:40.495 --> 01:36:42.096
She's back?

01:36:42.096 --> 01:36:46.000
Not Jingwen?
I mean pay my younger girl, Jiewen

01:36:47.869 --> 01:36:50.471
So your worries are over!
Going on holiday?

01:36:50.471 --> 01:36:53.975
No, I have to go to Japan

01:36:53.975 --> 01:36:56.811
But you hate Japanese!
Why go to Japan?

01:36:56.811 --> 01:36:58.646
Jingwen is getting married

01:37:02.517 --> 01:37:03.351
Congratulations

01:37:05.053 --> 01:37:08.022
I wasn't sure whether to go or not

01:37:08.022 --> 01:37:11.459
Now I've decided...
I just want her to be happy

01:37:13.361 --> 01:37:16.297
When do you leave?
Can you help me choose a present?

01:37:16.297 --> 01:37:17.665
No need for that

01:37:20.968 --> 01:37:23.504
She wanted me to ask you something

01:37:23.504 --> 01:37:24.672
What is it'?

01:37:24.672 --> 01:37:28.376
She read your story '2047'.
She likes it a lot

01:37:28.376 --> 01:37:31.279
But she finds the ending too sad

01:37:31.279 --> 01:37:34.148
She wonders if you can change it?

01:37:37.151 --> 01:37:38.152
I'll see what I can do

01:37:53.868 --> 01:37:58.139
<i>An hour later</i>

01:38:10.885 --> 01:38:15.022
<i>1O hours later</i>

01:38:22.964 --> 01:38:27.001
<i>100 hours later</i>

01:38:52.093 --> 01:38:53.461
Taxi!

01:38:53.461 --> 01:38:56.764
I also like the story to
have a happy ending

01:38:56.764 --> 01:38:59.500
But I don't know how to write it

01:38:59.500 --> 01:39:02.970
Some years back I had a happy
ending in my grasp

01:39:03.971 --> 01:39:05.540
But I let it slip away

01:39:20.521 --> 01:39:24.058
Don't turn your back on me!
Has he been here?

01:39:24.058 --> 01:39:24.659
What's it to you?

01:39:24.659 --> 01:39:29.697
While I was depressed,
Iran into Lulu again

01:39:30.965 --> 01:39:34.001
She hadn't changed,
still intensively jealous

01:39:34.001 --> 01:39:38.473
You think he's yours?
I thought you knew him well!

01:40:06.801 --> 01:40:09.737
Watching her taught me something

01:40:11.072 --> 01:40:13.140
When you don't take
'no' for an answer

01:40:13.140 --> 01:40:14.609
there is still a chance
you'll get what you want

01:40:32.994 --> 01:40:37.064
<i>18 months later</i>

01:40:46.741 --> 01:40:48.509
Hello, is Mr Chow there?

01:40:52.213 --> 01:40:56.817
I know I have no right to ask

01:40:56.817 --> 01:40:58.886
but they say I need a guarantor

01:41:01.856 --> 01:41:06.661
The man who recruits girls
for the nightclub

01:41:06.661 --> 01:41:07.995
says he knows you

01:41:09.397 --> 01:41:11.933
Can you talk to him for me?

01:41:16.103 --> 01:41:17.204
No problem

01:41:18.406 --> 01:41:19.874
I know the man you mean

01:41:22.710 --> 01:41:24.145
I'll see him in a day or two

01:41:26.013 --> 01:41:27.348
Why did you choose Singapore?

01:41:29.450 --> 01:41:31.886
I don't want to stay here any longer

01:41:33.054 --> 01:41:38.025
I've been thinking about it for some
time. I want to take a look at the place

01:41:42.163 --> 01:41:43.431
Don't drink too much

01:41:44.765 --> 01:41:46.133
You don't look well

01:41:49.737 --> 01:41:54.175
Don't worry, it won't kill me

01:41:59.647 --> 01:42:00.615
You know what?

01:42:02.783 --> 01:42:05.119
I came by here at Christmas

01:42:08.489 --> 01:42:10.257
I thought I might run into you

01:42:11.325 --> 01:42:12.693
Why didn't you call me first?

01:42:14.795 --> 01:42:15.997
I don't know

01:42:18.299 --> 01:42:19.700
I came on impulse

01:42:29.977 --> 01:42:31.679
I don't know why

01:42:35.449 --> 01:42:36.917
That night I suddenly missed
you so much

01:42:43.257 --> 01:42:45.459
We're drinking pals

01:42:46.360 --> 01:42:47.662
Of course you'll miss me

01:42:55.503 --> 01:42:56.537
You're right

01:43:01.108 --> 01:43:02.910
“We're drinking pals”

01:43:14.689 --> 01:43:15.690
Let's go

01:43:18.192 --> 01:43:21.128
- The check
- Yes

01:43:24.298 --> 01:43:25.466
Where are you staying?

01:43:27.268 --> 01:43:30.771
In a hotel, a rather small room

01:43:32.773 --> 01:43:35.209
But it's not too bad

01:43:35.209 --> 01:43:37.545
I'll see you back

01:43:37.545 --> 01:43:42.116
No, thanks
I've just moved in, it's a mess

01:43:44.385 --> 01:43:46.220
<i>I'll</i> invite you once it's cleaned up

01:43:49.123 --> 01:43:50.257
<i>I'll go</i> first

01:44:07.975 --> 01:44:10.077
Seeing how much
Bai Ling had changed

01:44:10.077 --> 01:44:12.646
I was suddenly overcome
by a feeling of grief

01:44:12.646 --> 01:44:15.916
Indeed, last Christmas
I was not in Hong Kong

01:44:17.318 --> 01:44:21.188
24 December, 1969

01:44:41.609 --> 01:44:43.778
Have you seen Miss Su?

01:44:43.778 --> 01:44:47.481
Miss Su...
not for some time

01:44:47.481 --> 01:44:50.184
- Any idea where she might be?
- Probably back in Phnom Penh

01:44:52.153 --> 01:44:56.090
I didn't want to spend Christmas
1969 in Hong Kong

01:44:56.090 --> 01:44:59.527
So I visited Singapore
and went back to the casino

01:45:00.928 --> 01:45:04.365
I waited for several clays,
but Black Spider never turned up

01:45:04.365 --> 01:45:06.000
No one knew where she was

01:45:06.801 --> 01:45:10.704
Some thought she'd gone back to
Phnom Penh. Others thought she was dead

01:45:15.376 --> 01:45:17.912
Ping and I began working
in Singapore in 1963

01:45:19.747 --> 01:45:21.348
When my life lost most of its meaning

01:45:23.951 --> 01:45:25.386
I started gambling every day

01:45:30.958 --> 01:45:35.362
Those were hard times for me
And only one person came to my rescue

01:45:35.362 --> 01:45:38.799
A professional gambler
Some said she was a cheat

01:45:40.134 --> 01:45:44.538
She always wore black
They called her Black Spider

01:45:44.538 --> 01:45:48.242
She kept her black glove on
for 365 days of the year

01:45:48.242 --> 01:45:51.111
Nobody knew why for sure

01:45:51.111 --> 01:45:54.715
Had her hand been chopped off
for cheating?

01:45:54.715 --> 01:45:58.285
Did the glove cover up
a fake hand?

01:45:58.285 --> 01:45:59.620
Nobody really knew

01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:21.642
Why do you wear that black glove?

01:46:24.144 --> 01:46:25.346
It's a habit

01:46:27.448 --> 01:46:28.616
You're not from here?

01:46:30.651 --> 01:46:32.052
I am from Phnom Penh

01:46:34.188 --> 01:46:38.559
What a coincidence!
I was just in Cambodia

01:46:42.863 --> 01:46:44.932
The place is in chaos,
what were you doing there?

01:46:47.601 --> 01:46:48.636
The newspaper sent me

01:46:52.506 --> 01:46:53.407
You're a journalist?

01:46:55.175 --> 01:46:55.943
Not any more

01:46:58.479 --> 01:46:59.513
Why's that?

01:47:03.317 --> 01:47:07.955
They made some changes,
and I'm now a 'consultant'

01:47:07.955 --> 01:47:10.591
On half-pay,
with next to nothing to do

01:47:17.031 --> 01:47:19.033
So why are you spending your time
in the casino?

01:47:21.835 --> 01:47:23.771
I tried to win enough to pay
my way back to Hong Kong

01:47:28.809 --> 01:47:31.211
You lost a lot?

01:47:31.211 --> 01:47:32.212
A few thousand

01:47:38.485 --> 01:47:42.156
You should never set foot
in a casino in a bad mood

01:47:42.156 --> 01:47:43.057
You won't win

01:47:47.061 --> 01:47:50.364
I didn't expect to win
I just hoped to get back my stake

01:47:57.338 --> 01:47:58.839
If you have any left...

01:48:01.642 --> 01:48:02.943
I can help you

01:48:04.378 --> 01:48:08.682
On one condition
When you've got your money back

01:48:08.682 --> 01:48:09.883
stop gambling

01:48:17.725 --> 01:48:18.726
Why are you helping me?

01:48:20.894 --> 01:48:22.262
I take a commission

01:48:23.731 --> 01:48:26.700
10% of whatever I win for you

01:48:32.573 --> 01:48:33.674
Think it over

01:48:40.714 --> 01:48:45.386
What good to her were her tiny
commissions on my winnings?

01:48:45.386 --> 01:48:48.122
After that, we went back
to the casino night after night

01:48:48.122 --> 01:48:52.192
We'd eat at the stall next to
the railway station

01:48:52.192 --> 01:48:55.295
She won back all the money I'd lost

01:49:03.804 --> 01:49:04.905
Thank you

01:49:06.940 --> 01:49:08.475
Don't thank me, it's yours

01:49:13.714 --> 01:49:17.451
If you need me again tomorrow
I'll be waiting here after dinner

01:49:22.056 --> 01:49:23.624
I still don't know your name

01:49:30.130 --> 01:49:33.100
It's Su
Su Lizhen

01:49:38.839 --> 01:49:42.443
A few years ago I fell in love
with another man's wife

01:49:42.443 --> 01:49:44.378
Her name was also Su Lizhen

01:49:48.949 --> 01:49:51.752
It was because of her
that I moved to Singapore

01:49:53.720 --> 01:49:57.858
I never dreamed
I'd meet another Su Lizhen

01:50:03.130 --> 01:50:07.367
I told her a lot about
the other Su Lizhen

01:50:07.367 --> 01:50:08.802
At first, we kept it secret

01:50:09.970 --> 01:50:11.738
But gossip soon spread

01:50:12.973 --> 01:50:17.711
Later we moved into a hotel
We had Room 2046

01:50:20.347 --> 01:50:22.282
When I think back,
the whole thing was like a dream

01:50:24.918 --> 01:50:26.453
You loved her deeply?

01:50:32.659 --> 01:50:33.627
It's history

01:50:36.563 --> 01:50:38.832
Let's change the subject

01:50:38.832 --> 01:50:41.468
You, what did you do before?

01:50:48.041 --> 01:50:49.109
You want to know about me?

01:50:59.153 --> 01:51:01.188
Come on, <i>we'll</i> play high-low

01:51:01.188 --> 01:51:02.789
If you win, <i>I'll</i> tell you everything

01:51:21.775 --> 01:51:26.513
It struck me that her past was like
the hand she always kept gloved

01:51:26.513 --> 01:51:27.814
A mystery with no solution

01:51:44.398 --> 01:51:46.500
Of all the men I've met...

01:51:47.768 --> 01:51:49.369
you've been the best to me

01:51:54.341 --> 01:51:56.143
I'm already missing you

01:52:05.118 --> 01:52:06.153
Why won't you come with me?

01:52:12.125 --> 01:52:16.630
Didn't you promise not to ask?

01:52:23.837 --> 01:52:24.972
Hold me

01:52:27.874 --> 01:52:29.543
It may be years before we meet again

01:53:17.624 --> 01:53:21.228
The night we last saw each other
for the last time I told her

01:53:21.228 --> 01:53:22.663
Take care

01:53:25.432 --> 01:53:27.301
Maybe one day you'll escape your past

01:53:29.403 --> 01:53:30.737
If you do, look for me

01:54:55.122 --> 01:54:59.159
Now it strikes me that what I told
her was actually meant for myself

01:55:01.428 --> 01:55:03.530
In love, you can't bring on
a substitute

01:55:04.731 --> 01:55:07.601
I was looking for
what I'd felt with the other Su Lizhen

01:55:09.903 --> 01:55:11.705
I didn't realize that myself

01:55:12.839 --> 01:55:14.574
But I'm sure she did

01:55:31.324 --> 01:55:33.760
<i>When the peony blooms...</i>

01:55:33.760 --> 01:55:35.595
<i>she stands tall</i>

01:55:35.595 --> 01:55:37.264
<i>and then goes</i> away

01:55:37.264 --> 01:55:39.566
<i>Does she mean 'No' or 'Yes'?</i>

01:55:39.699 --> 01:55:42.269
All for me?
You want to get me drunk?

01:55:42.269 --> 01:55:46.573
I know you're a good drinker
Let's drink!

01:55:46.573 --> 01:55:48.141
As much as we can!

01:55:49.176 --> 01:55:52.012
If there's any leftover...

01:55:52.012 --> 01:55:54.548
finish it next time you're here

01:56:04.191 --> 01:56:08.094
One small thing I have to ask you
Here's some money, please take it

01:56:09.262 --> 01:56:11.498
What for?

01:56:11.498 --> 01:56:16.369
I know you borrowed from a friend
for my plane ticket

01:56:16.369 --> 01:56:18.438
Pay him back

01:56:18.438 --> 01:56:22.409
If there's any left,
pay my rent for me

01:56:24.344 --> 01:56:27.080
Where did you get so much money?

01:56:28.915 --> 01:56:30.383
An old customer

01:56:32.152 --> 01:56:37.257
He's always been fond of me
He treats me well

01:56:37.257 --> 01:56:41.495
But he's too old for me,
so I never paid him much attention

01:56:44.931 --> 01:56:47.767
I ran into him yesterday
while I was shopping

01:56:47.767 --> 01:56:49.503
He insisted on buying me dinner

01:56:53.373 --> 01:56:56.710
I needed money
So I went

01:56:59.713 --> 01:57:03.250
After dinner,
I told him I needed money

01:57:05.385 --> 01:57:09.155
He said I could have
as much as I wanted

01:57:13.960 --> 01:57:15.896
I told him I needed $5,000

01:57:19.533 --> 01:57:22.035
At first, I planned
to save it for Singapore

01:57:24.838 --> 01:57:26.306
But I'm using it now

01:57:32.279 --> 01:57:36.550
Don't be silly
You're still young.

01:57:36.550 --> 01:57:38.118
You have great prospects

01:57:39.786 --> 01:57:42.255
I borrowed the money
from my friends

01:57:42.255 --> 01:57:43.657
They don't need it back yet

01:57:45.525 --> 01:57:46.660
So keep this for yourself

01:57:52.132 --> 01:57:53.967
Pay me back later, there's no rush

01:57:58.838 --> 01:58:00.173
Why are you so kind to me?

01:58:02.542 --> 01:58:03.577
Perhaps it's fate

01:58:13.420 --> 01:58:14.721
Too bad it didn't last

01:58:17.090 --> 01:58:18.858
I wish it could have gone on longer

01:58:22.662 --> 01:58:25.432
Don't be like this
Let me buy you dinner tonight

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.703
- Waiter, the check!
- Coming

01:58:29.703 --> 01:58:30.971
No, let me

01:58:32.973 --> 01:58:34.541
You're too kind

01:58:36.109 --> 01:58:38.712
You've spent enough time
and money on me already

01:58:40.280 --> 01:58:43.249
I don't want to owe you too much

01:58:49.189 --> 01:58:51.925
I need to make a phone call

01:58:51.925 --> 01:58:54.394
Please settle the check,
<i>I'll</i> be outside

01:59:56.322 --> 01:59:57.724
Will you come in?

01:59:59.159 --> 02:00:00.694
No, thanks

02:00:01.494 --> 02:00:02.796
Get some rest

02:00:03.730 --> 02:00:05.465
I'll see you to the airport tomorrow

02:00:06.666 --> 02:00:07.701
Please don't

02:00:09.235 --> 02:00:10.904
I'll be terribly sad if you're there

02:00:15.675 --> 02:00:16.776
Take good care of yourself

02:00:33.159 --> 02:00:35.528
Why can't it be like it was before?

02:00:39.199 --> 02:00:40.266
Please don't go

02:00:42.602 --> 02:00:44.504
Stay with me tonight

02:00:48.842 --> 02:00:50.243
Let me borrow you

02:00:51.845 --> 02:00:52.912
Do you remember'?

02:00:54.948 --> 02:00:56.349
You once asked me...

02:00:57.383 --> 02:00:58.885
if there was anything I wouldn't lend

02:01:01.087 --> 02:01:02.288
I've given it a lot of thought

02:01:05.158 --> 02:01:06.526
And now I know...

02:01:09.062 --> 02:01:10.296
there is one thing...

02:01:13.800 --> 02:01:15.568
<i>I'll</i> never lend to anyone

02:02:01.347 --> 02:02:04.584
As I recall that was the
very last time we saw each other

02:02:06.920 --> 02:02:09.589
I haven't seen her since that night

02:02:22.836 --> 02:02:24.504
Why can't it be like it was before?

02:02:33.813 --> 02:02:37.183
<i>He didn't turn back</i>

02:02:37.183 --> 02:02:39.485
<i>It was as if he'd boarded
a</i> very <i>long train</i>

02:02:39.485 --> 02:02:41.688
<i>Heading for a drowsy future...</i>

02:02:41.688 --> 02:02:44.224
<i>through the unfathomable night</i>

02:02:48.328 --> 02:02:52.265
Everyone who goes to 2046
has the same intention

02:02:52.265 --> 02:02:54.467
They want to recapture lost memories

02:02:55.468 --> 02:02:57.871
Because in 2046...

02:02:57.871 --> 02:02:59.539
nothing ever changes

02:03:00.874 --> 02:03:03.376
But nobody really knows
if that's true or not

02:03:04.477 --> 02:03:07.347
Because nobody has ever come back
