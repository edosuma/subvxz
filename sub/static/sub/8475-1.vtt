WEBVTT

01:47.207 --> 01:50.459
So what am I supposed
to do with you, Professor?

01:52.662 --> 01:54.797
Why are you supposed to do anything?

01:54.831 --> 01:57.432
Well, like I said,
this ain't none of my doing.

01:57.467 --> 01:59.046
When I left out of here
going to work this morning

01:59.056 --> 02:01.025
you were no part of my plans,

02:01.026 --> 02:03.055
but here you is.

02:03.106 --> 02:05.557
Doesn't mean anything.
Everything that happened doesn't

02:05.608 --> 02:08.110
mean something else.

02:08.144 --> 02:10.011
What's it mean then?

02:10.029 --> 02:12.114
Doesn't mean anything.
You run into people.

02:12.148 --> 02:14.316
And maybe some of them are
in trouble or whatever,

02:14.350 --> 02:16.568
but it doesn't mean
you're responsible for them.

02:16.570 --> 02:18.070
Mm-hmm!

02:18.121 --> 02:20.823
Anyway people are always
looking out for perfect strangers

02:20.857 --> 02:22.729
are very often people who won't
look out for the ones

02:22.730 --> 02:25.289
they're supposed to look out for,
in my opinion.

02:25.563 --> 02:28.213
If you're just doing what
you're supposed to,

02:28.248 --> 02:30.632
you don't get to be a hero.

02:30.667 --> 02:31.867
And that would be me?

02:31.885 --> 02:33.585
I don't know. Would it?

02:33.636 --> 02:35.387
I can see how there might be
some truth in that,

02:35.421 --> 02:38.206
but in this particular case
I got to say I didn't know

02:38.224 --> 02:40.676
what sort of person I was supposed
to be on the lookout for

02:40.710 --> 02:42.928
or what I was supposed to do
when I found them.

02:42.979 --> 02:46.181
In this particular case
but one thing to go by.

02:46.215 --> 02:47.416
And that was?

02:47.418 --> 02:49.985
That was that they is standing there.

02:51.554 --> 02:53.655
You don't look like my brother.
But there he is,

02:53.690 --> 02:56.391
so maybe you'd better look again.

02:56.409 --> 02:58.026
And that's what you did?

02:58.060 --> 03:00.362
Well, I got to say

03:00.396 --> 03:02.080
you was kind of hard to ignore.

03:02.115 --> 03:04.366
Your approach was pretty direct.

03:04.400 --> 03:06.535
I didn't approach you.
I didn't even see you.

03:06.569 --> 03:10.572
What I don't understand, is how you
come to get yourself in such a fix.

03:10.607 --> 03:11.907
Yeah.

03:11.925 --> 03:14.242
Are you all right?
Did you sleep last night?

03:14.260 --> 03:15.527
No.

03:15.562 --> 03:18.180
Well,

03:18.214 --> 03:20.132
when did you decide
that today was the day?

03:20.183 --> 03:21.884
Was there something special about it?

03:21.918 --> 03:23.585
No.

03:23.603 --> 03:24.546
Well, today is my birthday,

03:24.547 --> 03:26.254
but I certainly don't
regard that as special.

03:26.272 --> 03:28.106
Well... Happy birthday, Professor.

03:28.141 --> 03:29.274
Thank you.

03:29.309 --> 03:31.059
So, you seen your birthday was coming

03:31.093 --> 03:33.362
and that seemed like a good day?

03:33.364 --> 03:35.397
Who knows?
Maybe birthday are dangerous,

03:35.431 --> 03:37.366
like Christmas.

03:37.400 --> 03:40.152
Ornaments hanging from the trees,
reeds from the doors

03:40.203 --> 03:42.771
and bodies from the steampipes
all over America.

03:42.805 --> 03:44.990
That don't say much for
Christmas, do it?

03:45.041 --> 03:46.959
Christmas is not what it used to be.

03:46.993 --> 03:49.962
Now I believe that to be a true
statement. I surely do.

03:49.996 --> 03:53.281
I've got to go.

03:55.752 --> 03:57.552
You always put your coat on like that?

03:57.554 --> 03:59.337
What's wrong with the way
I put my coat on?

03:59.339 --> 04:00.806
I ain't said nothing was
wrong with it,

04:00.840 --> 04:02.507
I'm just saying is that your
regular method.

04:02.558 --> 04:03.431
I don't have a regular method.

04:03.432 --> 04:04.927
- I just put it on.
- Mm-hmm.

04:04.961 --> 04:07.440
- It's what-- effeminate?
- What?

04:08.043 --> 04:10.030
I'm just studying the
of the professor.

04:10.031 --> 04:12.017
Well, I've got to go.

04:12.835 --> 04:14.903
Let me get my coat.

04:18.524 --> 04:20.158
What do you mean? Going with me where?

04:20.193 --> 04:21.810
Going with you wherever
it is you're going.

04:21.828 --> 04:23.695
- No, you're not.
- Yeah, I am.

04:23.746 --> 04:25.113
- I'm going home.
- All right.

04:25.147 --> 04:27.225
All right? But you're not going
home with me.

04:27.235 --> 04:28.866
Sure I am. Let me get my coat.

04:31.153 --> 04:32.245
You can't go home with me.

04:32.255 --> 04:33.268
- Why?
- You can't!

04:33.278 --> 04:34.767
Oh... what,

04:34.777 --> 04:37.796
you can go home with me
but I can't go home with you?

04:37.797 --> 04:39.399
No. I mean...no, that's not it.

04:39.400 --> 04:41.329
I just need to go home.

04:41.347 --> 04:43.331
- You live in an apartment?
- Yes.

04:43.349 --> 04:44.241
What, they don't let black folk
in there?

04:44.242 --> 04:45.133
No. I mean...

04:45.167 --> 04:47.102
Yes, of course they do.

04:47.136 --> 04:49.671
Look, no more jokes.
I've got to go. I'm very tired.

04:49.689 --> 04:52.774
All right, long as you don't run into
no hassle about getting me in there.

04:52.809 --> 04:55.444
- You're serious.
- Oh, I think you know I'm serious.

04:55.478 --> 04:57.846
- You can't be serious.
- I'm serious as a heart attack.

04:57.864 --> 04:59.982
- Why are you doing this?
- Me? I ain't got no choice.

05:00.016 --> 05:02.034
- Of course you have a choice.
- No, I ain't.

05:02.068 --> 05:03.652
Who appointed you my guardian angel?

05:03.686 --> 05:05.454
You know who appointed me
your guardian angel.

05:05.488 --> 05:07.572
Now look, I ain't ask for you
to jump into my arms

05:07.623 --> 05:09.875
- down at the subway this morning.
- I didn't jump into your arms.

05:09.909 --> 05:11.043
- You didn't?
- No.

05:11.077 --> 05:13.078
Well, how'd you get there then?

05:26.876 --> 05:29.594
What? Now we ain't going?

05:32.849 --> 05:36.885
Do you really think
Jesus is in this room?

05:38.271 --> 05:39.721
No.

05:39.739 --> 05:42.741
I don't think he's in this room.

05:46.228 --> 05:49.414
I know he's in this room.

05:55.371 --> 05:58.040
It's made me asking you if you think,
you got your coat off.

05:58.074 --> 06:00.625
It's not the same thing.
It's a matter of agreement.

06:00.676 --> 06:03.244
If you and I say that I have
my coat on

06:03.262 --> 06:06.848
and Cecil says that I'm naked and
have green skin and a tail,

06:06.883 --> 06:09.051
we might want to think about
where we should put Cecil

06:09.085 --> 06:11.553
so he doesn't hurt himself.

06:11.587 --> 06:12.754
Who's Cecil?

06:12.772 --> 06:14.940
He's not anybody.
He's just a hypothetical.

06:14.974 --> 06:17.692
There's not any Cecil.
He's just a character

06:17.727 --> 06:20.228
I made up to illustrate a point.

06:20.262 --> 06:21.696
- Made up?
- Yes.

06:21.731 --> 06:23.448
So his view of things don't count?

06:23.483 --> 06:25.117
No. That's why I made him up.

06:25.151 --> 06:27.602
I could have changed things around.
I could have made you the one

06:27.620 --> 06:29.071
who didn't think I was wearing a coat.

06:29.105 --> 06:31.573
And was green and all that other
shit you said?

06:31.607 --> 06:33.208
- Yes.
- But you didn't.

06:33.242 --> 06:35.276
- No.
- You load it all off on Cecil.

06:35.294 --> 06:36.945
Yes.

06:36.963 --> 06:38.547
But Cecil can't defend himself

06:38.581 --> 06:40.949
on account that he ain't in agreement
with everybody else,

06:40.967 --> 06:43.585
so his word don't count,
aside from the fact that

06:43.619 --> 06:46.088
you made him up and he's green
and everything.

06:46.122 --> 06:48.473
He's not the one who's green. I am.
Where is this going?

06:48.508 --> 06:50.008
I'm just trying to find
out about Cecil.

06:52.061 --> 06:54.012
Can you see Jesus?

06:54.063 --> 06:56.598
No, I can't see him.

06:56.632 --> 06:58.600
- But you talk to him.
- Don't miss a day.

06:58.634 --> 07:01.853
- And he talks to you.
- I have heard him, yes.

07:01.904 --> 07:03.805
Do you hear him, like, out loud?

07:03.823 --> 07:05.824
No no, not out loud ,
I don't hear a voice.

07:05.826 --> 07:07.826
I don't hear my own for that matter,

07:07.860 --> 07:09.444
but I have heard.

07:09.478 --> 07:11.479
Why coudn't Jesus just be
in your head?

07:11.497 --> 07:13.615
He is in my head.

07:13.649 --> 07:16.918
Well, then I don't understand
what it is you're trying to tell me.

07:16.953 --> 07:19.087
I know you don't honey. Look...

07:19.122 --> 07:21.089
First thing you got to understand is

07:21.124 --> 07:23.125
I ain't got original thought
in my head.

07:23.159 --> 07:26.544
If it ain't got the lingering scent
of divinty to it,

07:26.546 --> 07:29.214
- I ain't interested in it.
- The lingering scent of divinity.
of divinit

07:29.265 --> 07:30.849
- Yeah, you like that.
- It's not bad.

07:30.883 --> 07:32.851
Heard it on the radio--
a black preacher.

07:32.885 --> 07:35.554
The point is, if I don't try it
the other way,

07:35.605 --> 07:37.522
I don't mean no chip-in either.

07:37.557 --> 07:40.368
I mean blindfold, running
through the woods.

07:40.369 --> 07:43.178
Biting in my teeth, Lord...
didn't I tried.

07:43.212 --> 07:46.014
If you can find us somebody that
gave it better shot than me,

07:46.032 --> 07:48.266
I'd like to meet him, I surely would.

07:48.301 --> 07:49.701
And what do you think that got him?

07:49.735 --> 07:51.019
I don't know what it gave you.

07:51.037 --> 07:52.904
Life in death, is what it get me.

07:52.955 --> 07:54.372
Life in death.

07:54.407 --> 07:56.324
Too dead to even know
enough to lay down.

07:56.358 --> 07:59.244
I see.

08:00.646 --> 08:02.581
I don't think so.

08:02.632 --> 08:04.199
Let me ask you a question.

08:04.217 --> 08:05.884
Alright.

08:05.918 --> 08:07.252
You ever read this book?

08:07.303 --> 08:09.471
I've read parts of it.
I've read in it.

08:09.505 --> 08:11.006
Have you ever read it?

08:11.040 --> 08:13.008
Read the Book of Job.

08:13.042 --> 08:16.544
Have you ever read it?

08:16.562 --> 08:17.846
No.

08:17.880 --> 08:19.681
- But you read much books?
- Yes.

08:19.715 --> 08:21.900
- How many, you say?
- I ve no idea.

08:21.934 --> 08:24.653
Ballpark!

08:24.687 --> 08:26.404
Two a week,

08:26.439 --> 08:29.658
maybe 100 a year
for close to 40 years.

08:29.692 --> 08:32.410
Two a week...

08:32.445 --> 08:34.729
40 times 100 is 4000.

08:35.898 --> 08:38.900
I'm just messing with you, Professor.

08:38.918 --> 08:40.869
Tell you what-- give me a number,

08:40.903 --> 08:43.705
any number you like,
and I'll give you 40 times it back.

08:43.739 --> 08:45.507
- 26.
- 1040.

08:45.541 --> 08:47.759
- 118.
- 4720.

08:47.793 --> 08:49.911
- 4720.
- Yep.

08:49.929 --> 08:51.913
- The answer is the question.
- Say what?

08:51.931 --> 08:54.216
- That's your new number.
- 4720?

08:54.250 --> 08:56.384
- That's a big number, Professor.
- Yes it is.

08:56.418 --> 08:58.553
- You know the answer?
- No, I don't.

08:58.588 --> 09:00.021
188,800.

09:02.775 --> 09:04.926
Let me see that.

09:16.739 --> 09:18.273
How do you do that?

09:20.109 --> 09:21.876
Butter and eggs, crap table.

09:21.911 --> 09:24.629
You quick with numbers,
you can work the mojo on your brother,

09:24.664 --> 09:26.581
confiscate the contents
of his pocketbook.

09:26.615 --> 09:30.118
You get a lot of time to practice
that shit in the jailhouse.

09:31.804 --> 09:34.578
Let's get back to you
and all these books you read.

09:34.588 --> 09:39.144
- You say you had read 4000 books.
- Probably maybe more than that.

09:39.178 --> 09:40.812
But not this book.

09:40.846 --> 09:41.655
Uh, no, not the whole--

09:41.665 --> 09:44.149
- Why is that?
- I don't know.

09:44.183 --> 09:47.102
Well, what would you say
is the best book ever wrote?

09:47.136 --> 09:50.155
- I have no idea.
- Well, take a shot.

09:50.189 --> 09:54.159
- There are a lot of good books.
- Pick one.

09:54.193 --> 09:56.161
- Maybe "War and peace."
- All right.

09:56.195 --> 09:58.146
You think that book is
as good as this one?

09:58.164 --> 10:00.282
I don't know. They're different
kinds of books.

10:00.316 --> 10:03.201
This "War and peace" book--
it's a book somebody made up, right?

10:03.252 --> 10:04.452
Well, yes.

10:04.486 --> 10:06.421
So is that what makes it different
from this here book?

10:08.624 --> 10:10.792
Ain't neither one of them true?

10:10.826 --> 10:12.544
Not in the historical sense, no.

10:12.595 --> 10:14.179
Hmm.

10:14.213 --> 10:15.764
Well, what would be a true book?

10:15.798 --> 10:18.433
I suppose maybe a history book.

10:18.467 --> 10:21.136
Gibbon's "Decline and fall of the
Roman empire" might be one.

10:21.170 --> 10:23.138
At least the events would
be actual events.

10:23.172 --> 10:24.639
They would be things
that had happened.

10:24.673 --> 10:26.141
Hmm.

10:26.175 --> 10:29.394
So you think that book is as good
a book as this book?

10:29.445 --> 10:31.346
- The Bible?
- The Bible.

10:31.364 --> 10:34.149
I don't know. Gibbon's is
a cornerstone. It's a major book.

10:34.183 --> 10:36.684
- And a true book. Don't forget that.
- And a true book, yes.

10:36.702 --> 10:38.203
But is it as good a book?

10:38.237 --> 10:41.406
I don't know.

10:41.457 --> 10:43.425
I don't know as you can
make the comparison.

10:43.459 --> 10:44.859
We're talking about apples and pears.

10:44.877 --> 10:46.961
We ain't talking about no apples
and pears, Professor.

10:46.996 --> 10:48.163
We're talking about books.

10:48.197 --> 10:50.165
Is that "decline and fall" book

10:50.199 --> 10:52.200
as good a book as this here book?

10:52.218 --> 10:54.035
Answer the question.

10:54.069 --> 10:55.370
I'm gonna have to say no.

10:55.388 --> 10:58.556
Used to say, right hand on the cover

10:58.591 --> 11:00.541
before it got wore down.

11:00.559 --> 11:02.060
"The greatest book ever written."

11:02.062 --> 11:04.346
- Think that might be true?
- Don't know.

11:04.380 --> 11:07.532
- You read the book.
- I tried to, yes.

11:07.566 --> 11:09.684
But you ain't read the best book.

11:09.718 --> 11:12.320
- Why is that?
- I've got to go.

11:12.355 --> 11:14.989
You don't need to go, Professor.
Just stay here and visit with me.

11:15.024 --> 11:17.392
You're afraid I'll go back to
the train station.

11:17.410 --> 11:19.527
You might, so just stay here with me.

11:19.561 --> 11:20.995
What if I promised I wouldn't?

11:21.030 --> 11:22.280
You might anyway.

11:22.331 --> 11:24.249
Don't you need to go to work?

11:24.283 --> 11:25.784
I was on my way to work.

11:25.835 --> 11:27.735
A funny thing happened to you
on the way to work.

11:27.753 --> 11:29.254
Yes, it did.

11:29.288 --> 11:30.488
Will they fire you?

11:30.523 --> 11:32.374
No, they won't fire me.

11:32.408 --> 11:34.576
- You could call in.
- Ain't got no phone.

11:34.643 --> 11:36.811
Anyhow, they know
if I ain't there by now,

11:36.812 --> 11:38.763
I ain't coming. I ain't a late
sort of person.

11:38.798 --> 11:40.715
- Why don't you have a phone.
- Don't need one.

11:40.750 --> 11:44.119
- Junkies would steal it anyway.
- Get a cheap one.

11:44.403 --> 11:46.921
Don't get too cheap for a junkie.

11:48.470 --> 11:49.774
Let's get back to you.

11:50.810 --> 11:52.193
Just stick with me for a minute.

11:58.534 --> 12:00.485
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure you can.

12:00.536 --> 12:03.405
Where were you standing?
I never saw you.

12:03.439 --> 12:05.457
You mean when you took
your amazing leap?

12:05.491 --> 12:08.276
- Yes.
- I was on the platform.

12:08.294 --> 12:09.711
- On the platform?
- Yeah.

12:09.745 --> 12:11.212
Well, I didn't see you.

12:11.247 --> 12:13.748
I was standing on the platform,
minding my own business.

12:13.782 --> 12:15.884
Here you come, haulin' ass.

12:15.918 --> 12:18.136
I looked all around to make sure
there was no one there,

12:18.170 --> 12:20.388
particularly no children.

12:20.423 --> 12:22.223
There was nobody around.

12:22.258 --> 12:23.591
No, just me.

12:23.625 --> 12:26.627
Well, I don't know where
you could have been.

12:26.645 --> 12:29.347
Trying to get spooky on
me here, Professor?

12:29.398 --> 12:30.932
Maybe I was behind a post
or something.

12:30.966 --> 12:32.851
There wasn't any post.

12:32.902 --> 12:35.153
So what're you saying--
You're looking at some big black angel

12:35.187 --> 12:37.856
guy sent down here to snatch your
honky ass out of there

12:37.907 --> 12:39.908
at the last possible minute
and save you from destruction?

12:39.942 --> 12:41.493
No, I don't think that.

12:41.527 --> 12:43.745
- Such a thing ain't possible?
- No, it isn't.

12:43.779 --> 12:45.246
Well, you're the one suggested it.

12:45.248 --> 12:46.781
I never suggested any such thing.

12:46.815 --> 12:48.533
You are the one who put in
the stuff about angels.

12:48.584 --> 12:51.286
I never said anything about angels.
I don't believe in angels.

12:51.320 --> 12:54.088
Well, what is it you believe in?

12:54.090 --> 12:55.790
A lot of things.

12:55.824 --> 12:57.292
All right!

12:57.326 --> 12:59.677
- All right what?
- All right, what things?

12:59.712 --> 13:02.997
- I believe in things.
- Give me for instance.

13:03.015 --> 13:06.551
Um, cultural things, for instance,

13:06.602 --> 13:09.554
books, music, art, things like that.

13:09.605 --> 13:11.523
All right.

13:11.557 --> 13:14.559
Those are the things that
have value to me.

13:14.610 --> 13:16.844
They're the foundations
of civilization.

13:16.862 --> 13:18.846
Well, they used to have value to me.

13:18.864 --> 13:21.516
They don't have so much
value anymore, I guess.

13:25.571 --> 13:28.156
To a certain extent...

13:28.190 --> 13:30.158
I'm not sure I can tell you why.

13:30.192 --> 13:33.294
That world is largely gone now.

13:33.329 --> 13:35.363
Soon it will be wholly gone.

13:35.381 --> 13:37.966
I'm not sure I'm following you,
Professor.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.201
There's nothing to follow.
It's all right.

13:40.236 --> 13:42.870
The things I loved were very frail,

13:42.888 --> 13:44.806
very fragile.

13:44.840 --> 13:47.375
I didn't know that.
I thought they were indestructible.

13:47.393 --> 13:49.143
They weren't.

13:49.178 --> 13:51.312
And that's what sent you off the
edge of the platform?

13:51.347 --> 13:52.730
It wasn't nothing personal?

13:52.765 --> 13:54.899
Oh, it's personal.
That's what an education does.

13:54.934 --> 13:57.685
It makes the world personal.

13:57.719 --> 14:00.605
Well, them's some very
powerful words, Professor.

14:00.656 --> 14:03.825
And I can't say that I got an
answer to any of that

14:03.859 --> 14:05.994
and it might be that there
ain't no answer.

14:06.028 --> 14:08.446
But still, I got to ask.

14:08.497 --> 14:11.282
What's the use of having
notions of such a thing,

14:11.333 --> 14:13.451
if they won't keep you glued down
to the platform

14:13.485 --> 14:16.321
when the Sunset Limited is
coming through at 80mph?

14:16.355 --> 14:18.423
- Good question.
- I thought so.

14:18.457 --> 14:21.009
I don't have an answer
to any of that either.

14:21.043 --> 14:23.962
Maybe it's not logical.
I don't know. I don't care.

14:24.013 --> 14:25.930
I've been asked, didn't I think it odd

14:25.965 --> 14:28.716
that I should be around to
witness the death of everything?

14:28.750 --> 14:30.718
I do think it's odd.

14:30.752 --> 14:33.421
But that doesn't mean it isn't so.

14:33.439 --> 14:35.306
Somebody has to be here.

14:35.357 --> 14:38.031
But you don't intend to
hang around for it?

14:38.041 --> 14:39.527
No, I don't.

14:41.363 --> 14:43.264
Let me see if I got this straight.

14:43.282 --> 14:46.234
You're saying that all
this culture stuff

14:46.268 --> 14:49.454
is the only thing between you and
the Sunset Limited.

14:49.488 --> 14:51.489
- It's a lot.
- But it busted out on you.

14:51.540 --> 14:52.740
Yes.

14:52.775 --> 14:55.176
You're a culture junkie.

14:58.047 --> 14:59.731
Maybe you're right.

14:59.765 --> 15:03.835
Maybe I have no beliefs.

15:03.886 --> 15:07.555
I believe in the Sunset Limited.

15:07.590 --> 15:09.557
Damn, Professor.

15:09.592 --> 15:11.309
Damn indeed.

15:11.343 --> 15:13.544
No beliefs?

15:13.579 --> 15:17.565
The things I believed in

15:17.600 --> 15:20.685
no longer exist.

15:20.736 --> 15:23.021
It's foolish to pretend they do.

15:23.072 --> 15:26.524
Western civilization
finally went up in smoke

15:26.575 --> 15:28.493
in the chimneys of Dachau,

15:28.527 --> 15:31.496
and I was too infatuated to see it.

15:31.530 --> 15:33.915
I see it now.

15:37.786 --> 15:39.704
Hoo!

15:39.755 --> 15:41.789
You're a challenge, Professor,
you know that.

15:41.823 --> 15:43.491
Well, there's no reason for you

15:43.509 --> 15:47.095
to become involved in my problems.

15:47.129 --> 15:49.631
I should go.

15:53.135 --> 15:55.670
- Have you got any friends?
- No.

15:55.688 --> 15:57.772
- Come on, Professor, not one?
- Not really, no.

15:57.806 --> 15:59.674
- Tell me about that one.
- What one?

15:59.692 --> 16:03.144
- The "not really" one.
- I have a friend at the university--

16:03.178 --> 16:05.947
not a close friend.
We have lunch from time to time.

16:05.981 --> 16:09.083
But that's as good as it gets?

16:09.118 --> 16:10.218
Yes.

16:10.252 --> 16:12.070
What'd you do to him?

16:12.104 --> 16:14.122
- What'd I do to him?
- Yeah.

16:14.156 --> 16:16.124
I didn't do anything to him.

16:16.158 --> 16:18.126
What makes you think I did
something to him?

16:18.160 --> 16:19.410
I don't know. Did you?

16:19.461 --> 16:20.662
No.

16:20.696 --> 16:22.747
What is it you think I did to him?

16:22.798 --> 16:24.499
I don't know. Maybe you can tell me.

16:24.533 --> 16:26.918
There's nothing to tell.

16:26.969 --> 16:29.203
You didn't leave him a note or nothing

16:29.221 --> 16:31.305
- to tell him you've taken the train?
- No!

16:31.340 --> 16:33.257
- Your best friend?
- He's not my best friend.

16:33.308 --> 16:35.259
I thought we just got done
deciding he was.

16:35.310 --> 16:38.012
You just got done deciding he--

16:38.046 --> 16:40.565
Did you ever tell him you was
thinking about this?

16:40.599 --> 16:43.151
- No. Why should I?
- 'Cause he's your best friend.

16:43.185 --> 16:45.103
He's-- I told you,
we're not all that close.

16:45.154 --> 16:46.854
- You're not all that close?
- No!

16:46.888 --> 16:48.740
He's your best friend,
only you ain't all that close?

16:48.774 --> 16:50.224
If you'd like.

16:50.242 --> 16:53.194
Not the way you'd want to bother
him with a little thing like

16:53.228 --> 16:54.812
...suicide?

16:56.031 --> 16:57.898
Look,

16:57.916 --> 17:02.903
suppose I were to give you my word

17:02.921 --> 17:05.540
that I would just go home

17:05.574 --> 17:09.010
and I wouldn't try to kill
myself enroute.

17:23.592 --> 17:27.261
Supposed I was to give you my word

17:27.296 --> 17:30.565
that I wouldn't listen
to none of your bullshit.

17:35.704 --> 17:37.455
You know better than that.

17:39.374 --> 17:41.776
You was a prisoner before
you got here--

17:44.379 --> 17:47.215
A death row prisoner.

17:49.951 --> 17:52.220
What did your daddy do?

17:52.254 --> 17:53.337
What?

17:53.388 --> 17:56.023
I said what did your daddy do--

17:56.058 --> 17:57.842
What kind of work?

18:02.297 --> 18:03.431
He was a lawyer.

18:03.465 --> 18:04.766
- A lawyer?
- Yeah.

18:04.800 --> 18:06.734
What kind of law did he do?

18:06.769 --> 18:09.987
He was a government lawyer. He didn't
do criminal law or anything like that.

18:10.022 --> 18:12.373
What would be a thing
like criminal law?

18:12.407 --> 18:14.275
I don't know. Divorce law maybe.

18:16.311 --> 18:18.813
Mm-h. Maybe you got a point.

18:18.831 --> 18:20.331
What'd he die of?

18:20.365 --> 18:21.999
Who said he was dead?

18:22.034 --> 18:24.786
- Is he dead?
- Yes.

18:24.820 --> 18:26.437
What did he die of?

18:26.472 --> 18:27.738
Cancer.

18:27.773 --> 18:29.640
Cancer. So he was sick for a while?

18:29.675 --> 18:31.159
Yes, he was.

18:31.193 --> 18:33.327
- Did you go see him?
- No.

18:33.362 --> 18:35.797
- How come?
- I didn't want to.

18:35.831 --> 18:37.698
How come you didn't want to?

18:37.733 --> 18:41.068
I don't know. I just didn't.

18:41.103 --> 18:43.171
Maybe I didn't want to
remember him that way.

18:43.205 --> 18:45.356
Mm, bullshit.

18:45.390 --> 18:46.891
Did he ask you to come?

18:48.527 --> 18:50.812
- But your mama did.
- She may have. I don't remember.

18:50.846 --> 18:53.047
Come on, Professor.
You know she asked you to come.

18:53.081 --> 18:54.382
Okay, yes.

18:54.416 --> 18:56.734
- What did you tell her?
- I said I would.

18:56.785 --> 18:58.753
- But you didn't?
- No.

18:58.787 --> 19:01.622
- How come?
- He died.

19:01.657 --> 19:03.374
No no, that ain't it.

19:03.408 --> 19:05.309
You had time to go see him,
but you didn't do it.

19:05.344 --> 19:07.011
I suppose.

19:07.045 --> 19:08.513
You waited till he was dead.

19:08.547 --> 19:10.131
Okay,

19:10.165 --> 19:12.500
so I didn't go see my father.

19:14.052 --> 19:17.054
Your father is laying on his deathbed
dying of cancer.

19:17.089 --> 19:19.173
Your mama's sitting there with him,
holding his hand.

19:19.207 --> 19:21.041
He's in all kind of pain.

19:21.059 --> 19:24.395
They ask you to come see him
one last time before he died.

19:24.429 --> 19:26.380
And you tell him,
"No, I ain't coming."

19:26.398 --> 19:28.499
Please tell me I got some part
of this wrong.

19:28.534 --> 19:30.384
If that's the way you want to put it.

19:30.402 --> 19:32.553
- Well, how would you put it?
- I don't know.

19:32.571 --> 19:34.221
Well, that's the
way it is then, ain't it?

19:34.239 --> 19:36.958
- I suppossed.
- No, ain't no suppose.

19:36.992 --> 19:39.694
- Is it or ain't it?
- Yes.

19:42.331 --> 19:43.497
Whoo!

19:43.532 --> 19:45.833
Let me see if can find
my train schedule,

19:45.835 --> 19:49.069
see when that next
uptown express is due.

19:52.754 --> 19:54.828
I'm not sure I see the humour.

19:56.536 --> 19:58.045
I'm glad to hear you say that,
Professor...

19:58.079 --> 19:59.347
'Cause I ain't sure either.

19:59.381 --> 20:02.967
I get more amazed by the minute.

20:07.422 --> 20:09.423
How come you can't see yourself?

20:09.441 --> 20:10.892
You're clear as glass.

20:10.926 --> 20:13.361
I could see the wheels in there,
turning the gears.

20:13.395 --> 20:15.947
I can see light too-- Good light,

20:15.981 --> 20:19.033
true light. Can't you see it?

20:19.067 --> 20:21.319
No, I can't.

20:22.321 --> 20:24.939
Well, bless you, brother.

20:24.957 --> 20:27.041
Bless and keep you,

20:42.257 --> 20:46.761
When were you in the penitentiary

20:46.795 --> 20:49.129
- A long time ago.
- What were you in for?

20:49.147 --> 20:52.183
- Murder.
- Really?

20:52.234 --> 20:54.735
Now who would claim to be a murderer

20:54.770 --> 20:56.904
that wasn't one?

21:04.479 --> 21:06.447
You called it the jailhouse.

21:06.481 --> 21:07.999
Yeah.

21:08.033 --> 21:09.601
Do most black people call

21:09.822 --> 21:12.486
the penitentiary, the jailhouse?

21:12.504 --> 21:15.289
No, just us old country niggers.

21:17.659 --> 21:19.927
We make a point to call things
what they is.

21:19.962 --> 21:23.464
I'd hate to think how many names
there is for the jailhouse.

21:26.334 --> 21:27.969
I'd hate to have to count them.

21:28.003 --> 21:29.971
Do you have
a lot of jailhouse stories?

21:30.005 --> 21:32.189
- Jailhouse stories?
- Yeah...

21:34.226 --> 21:36.176
I don't know.

21:36.194 --> 21:38.178
I used to tell jailhouse stories,

21:38.196 --> 21:41.649
but they kind of lost their charm.

21:41.683 --> 21:43.484
Why don't we talk about something

21:43.518 --> 21:45.019
that's a little more cheerful?

21:45.037 --> 21:46.854
You ever been married?

21:46.872 --> 21:47.955
Married?

21:47.990 --> 21:49.924
- Yeah!
- Oh, man.

21:49.958 --> 21:51.909
What?

21:55.530 --> 21:58.699
Maybe we ought to take another
look at them jailhouse stories.

21:58.717 --> 22:01.368
Oh my.

22:01.386 --> 22:02.636
Oo!

22:02.671 --> 22:04.005
Do you have any children?

22:04.039 --> 22:06.307
No, Professor. I ain't got nobody.

22:06.341 --> 22:08.309
Everybody in my family's dead.

22:08.343 --> 22:11.545
I had two boys, but they died
a long time ago.

22:11.563 --> 22:15.483
Just about everybody I ever
know has died for that matter.

22:15.517 --> 22:17.435
You ought to think about that.

22:17.486 --> 22:19.219
I might be a hazard to your health.

22:19.237 --> 22:21.522
Were you always in a lot of trouble?

22:21.556 --> 22:22.990
Yeah, I was.

22:23.025 --> 22:25.242
I liked it.

22:25.277 --> 22:27.661
I think I still do.

22:27.663 --> 22:29.663
I done seven years hard times.

22:29.698 --> 22:31.732
Could have done a lot more.
Hurt a lot of people.

22:31.750 --> 22:34.785
I used to smack 'em around,
and they wouldn't get up no more.

22:34.836 --> 22:36.837
- But you don't get in trouble now?
- No.

22:36.872 --> 22:38.372
But you still like it?

22:38.407 --> 22:41.509
Well, maybe I'm just condemned to it,

22:41.543 --> 22:43.878
bit in the ass by my own karma.

22:43.912 --> 22:45.763
But I'm on the other side now.

22:45.797 --> 22:47.598
You want to help folk
that's in trouble,

22:47.632 --> 22:49.633
you put in as much got to go
where the troubles at,

22:49.684 --> 22:52.486
you ain't got a lot of choice.

22:52.521 --> 22:53.854
How long have you been here?

22:53.889 --> 22:56.524
Oh, six going on to seven years.

22:56.558 --> 22:58.159
I don't understand why you live here.

23:00.112 --> 23:01.195
Anywhere.

23:01.229 --> 23:04.565
This pretty much here is anywhere.

23:04.599 --> 23:08.035
I could live in another building,
I suppose, but...

23:08.070 --> 23:10.604
...It's all right.

23:10.622 --> 23:13.457
I got my bedroom over yonder

23:13.492 --> 23:15.442
where I can get away,

23:15.460 --> 23:17.444
got a sofa where folk can crash--

23:17.462 --> 23:19.547
junkies and crackheads mostly.

23:19.581 --> 23:22.550
Of course, they're gonna walk off
with all your portables,

23:22.584 --> 23:25.302
so you can't own nothing.
But that's good.

23:25.337 --> 23:27.304
You hang out with the right crowd,

23:27.339 --> 23:30.057
you pretty much get over
all your worldly craving.

23:30.092 --> 23:32.059
They took the refrigerator one time,

23:32.094 --> 23:34.061
but somebody caught them
out there on the stairs,

23:34.096 --> 23:35.729
made them bring it back up.

23:35.831 --> 23:38.489
Now I got that big sucker
over yonder, traded up.

23:42.487 --> 23:44.905
Only thing I miss,

23:44.940 --> 23:46.273
is the music.

23:46.307 --> 23:49.476
I aim to get me a steel door.

23:49.494 --> 23:52.029
Then I can have me some music here.

23:52.080 --> 23:56.167
But you got to buy the door and
the frame at the same time.

23:56.201 --> 23:58.152
I'm working on that.

23:59.921 --> 24:02.790
I don't care nothing about television,

24:02.824 --> 24:05.910
but I sure do miss the music.

24:05.944 --> 24:09.647
You don't think
this is a terrible place?

24:09.681 --> 24:12.099
A terrible place?

24:12.134 --> 24:13.517
Yes.

24:13.552 --> 24:14.969
What are you talking about?

24:15.003 --> 24:18.139
This place. It's a horrible place
full of horrible people.

24:18.173 --> 24:19.356
Oh my.

24:19.391 --> 24:21.642
You must know that these people
are not worth saving,

24:21.676 --> 24:24.845
even if they could be saved,
which they can't. You must know that.

24:24.863 --> 24:27.565
Well, I like a challenge.

24:27.616 --> 24:30.284
I started a ministry 'fore I got out
of prison.

24:30.318 --> 24:31.952
Now, that was a challenge.

24:31.987 --> 24:33.954
There was a lot of brothers
who showed up.

24:33.989 --> 24:35.522
They ain't care nothing about it.

24:35.540 --> 24:37.908
They ain't really care nothing about
the word of God.

24:37.959 --> 24:39.359
They just wanted it on the resume.

24:39.377 --> 24:41.028
- Resume?
- Resume.

24:41.046 --> 24:44.131
You got some brothers in there
does some real bad shit.

24:44.166 --> 24:46.917
And they weren't sorry about
a damn thing except getting caught.

24:46.968 --> 24:51.055
But the funny thing was,
a lot of them did believe in God.

24:51.089 --> 24:54.208
Even more so than a lot of these
people out here on the outside.

24:54.226 --> 24:55.976
I know I did.

24:56.011 --> 24:57.678
You ought to think
about that, Professor.

24:57.712 --> 25:00.064
- I think I'd better go.
- Oh hey!

25:00.098 --> 25:02.099
You ain't got to go, Professor.

25:02.101 --> 25:04.068
Let me ask you something.

25:04.102 --> 25:06.187
Do you ever had one of them days

25:06.221 --> 25:10.157
where everything was just
weird all the way around,

25:10.192 --> 25:12.826
when things just kind of
fell into place?

25:12.861 --> 25:14.078
I'm not sure what you mean.

25:14.112 --> 25:17.114
Just one of them days, you know,
kind of magic,

25:17.165 --> 25:20.734
one of them days where everything
turned out right.

25:20.752 --> 25:22.536
I don't know. Maybe. Why?

25:22.570 --> 25:24.955
Well, I'm just wondering
if it ain't been

25:25.006 --> 25:28.626
maybe sort of long dry spell for you

25:28.677 --> 25:30.628
till you took up with the notion

25:30.679 --> 25:32.079
that, that's the way the world is.

25:32.097 --> 25:33.597
- The way the world is?
- Yeah.

25:33.632 --> 25:36.050
- And how is that?
- You know, long and dry.

25:36.084 --> 25:38.018
But the point is

25:38.053 --> 25:40.054
that even if you feel that way,

25:40.088 --> 25:42.022
what you got to understand

25:42.057 --> 25:44.558
is that the sun don't shine
up the same dog's ass every day.

25:44.592 --> 25:46.560
You understand what I'm saying?

25:46.562 --> 25:47.796
If what you're saying
is that I'm simply

25:47.797 --> 25:49.029
having a bad day, that's ridiculous.

25:49.064 --> 25:51.232
I ain't saying you're having
a bad day, Professor...

25:51.266 --> 25:52.566
I'm saying you're having a bad life.

25:52.600 --> 25:54.601
You think I should change my life?

25:54.635 --> 25:56.570
- What, you shitting me?
- I have to go

25:56.604 --> 25:59.123
Look, look, just hang with me
a little while longer.

26:01.409 --> 26:03.377
What about my jailhouse story?

26:03.411 --> 26:06.130
You don't need no jailhouse story.

26:06.164 --> 26:07.498
Why not?

26:07.549 --> 26:10.284
Well, you're suspicious
about everything already.

26:10.302 --> 26:12.419
You think I'm trying to put you
in the trick bag.

26:12.453 --> 26:13.504
And you're not?

26:13.555 --> 26:15.839
Well yeah, but I don't want you
to know it.

26:15.890 --> 26:17.641
Well, in any case, I have to go.

26:17.676 --> 26:19.643
You ain't ready to go back out
there on them streets.

26:19.678 --> 26:21.204
- I have to.
- I know you ain't

26:21.205 --> 26:22.730
got nothing you got to do.

26:22.764 --> 26:24.240
- How do you know that?
- 'Cause you ain't

26:24.241 --> 26:25.716
even supposed to be here.

26:25.750 --> 26:29.136
I see your point.

26:29.154 --> 26:31.155
What if I tell you a jailhouse story?

26:31.189 --> 26:33.324
Will you stay then?

26:36.244 --> 26:38.529
All right. I'll stay a while.

26:38.580 --> 26:43.984
All right! The man says all right.

26:44.002 --> 26:45.586
Is it a true story?

26:45.620 --> 26:48.059
Oh yeah, it's a true story.
I don't know no other kind.

26:49.007 --> 26:52.343
One day, I'm in the chow line
and I'm getting my chow.

26:52.377 --> 26:54.345
When the nigger in the line behind me

26:54.379 --> 26:56.764
gets into it with the server,
says the beans is cold.

26:56.798 --> 26:59.466
So he throws the ladle
down in the beans.

26:59.500 --> 27:00.934
Well, when he done that

27:00.969 --> 27:02.936
there was beans splashed up on me.

27:03.515 --> 27:05.845
Well, I didn't want to get
into it over no beans,

27:05.846 --> 27:08.175
but he kind of piss me off some.

27:08.193 --> 27:10.027
I'd just put on a clean uniform--

27:10.061 --> 27:12.363
you know, khakis, shirt and trousers.

27:12.397 --> 27:14.114
You know, and you only get two a week.

27:14.149 --> 27:16.033
so I said something to him

27:16.067 --> 27:18.986
like "Hey man, watch it"
or something like that.

27:19.020 --> 27:21.538
But I went on. I'm telling myself,

27:21.573 --> 27:26.144
"Just let it go. Just let it go."
But then that nigger said something.

27:27.302 --> 27:29.663
So I turned back.

27:29.697 --> 27:31.332
And when I done that,

27:31.366 --> 27:33.200
he stuck a knife in me.

27:33.218 --> 27:38.088
I ain't even it coming.
Blood's just flying everywhere.

27:38.139 --> 27:40.707
This was one of them
Italian switchblades,

27:40.725 --> 27:42.593
one of them black-and-silver jobs.

27:42.644 --> 27:44.428
Well, I ain't do a thing but duck

27:44.479 --> 27:46.730
and step back onto the rail.

27:46.765 --> 27:49.900
And I reached out and I got hold of
this table leg.

27:49.934 --> 27:53.354
And come off in my hand just as easy.

27:53.388 --> 27:55.189
It had this long screw

27:55.223 --> 27:57.224
sticking out the end of it.

27:57.242 --> 28:00.694
And I went to wailing on
that nigger's head!

28:00.728 --> 28:02.446
And I ain't quit!

28:02.448 --> 28:04.865
And I ain't quit till
you couldn't tell it was

28:04.899 --> 28:07.084
a head no more.

28:07.118 --> 28:09.437
That screw was stick in
his head and I have to

28:09.438 --> 28:11.755
put my foot on it to pull it out.

28:15.593 --> 28:18.545
- What he say?
- What he say?

28:18.579 --> 28:20.130
I mean in the line, what he say?

28:20.181 --> 28:22.266
- I ain't gonna repeat it.
- That doesn't seem fair.

28:22.300 --> 28:23.684
- Don't seem fair?
- No.

28:23.718 --> 28:25.352
Here I am telling you

28:25.387 --> 28:28.389
a bona fide blood-and-guts tale,
from the big house,

28:28.391 --> 28:30.274
the genuine article and
I can't get you to

28:30.308 --> 28:32.226
fill in the blanks about
what the nigger said.

28:32.260 --> 28:34.228
- Do you have to use that word?
- Use that word?

28:34.230 --> 28:35.497
- Yes.
- We ain't making much

28:35.498 --> 28:36.763
progress here, is we?

28:36.781 --> 28:38.532
It just seem unneccessary.

28:38.566 --> 28:41.085
You don't want to hear nigger
but you about to bail on me

28:41.106 --> 28:43.641
cause I won't tell you some
ugly shit the nigger said.

28:43.651 --> 28:44.987
- Is you sure about this?
- I just don't

28:44.988 --> 28:46.323
see why you have to use that word.

28:46.374 --> 28:48.492
It's my story, ain't it?

28:48.543 --> 28:51.245
Anyway, I don't remember there
being no African- American,

28:51.279 --> 28:52.779
people of color in there.

28:52.797 --> 28:57.251
To my recollection there
was only a bunch of niggers.

28:58.136 --> 28:59.536
Go ahead.

29:01.306 --> 29:03.090
Now at some point,

29:03.124 --> 29:05.676
I musta pulled the knife out and--

29:05.727 --> 29:07.294
and dropped it on the floor
somewhere.

29:07.312 --> 29:10.764
Meanwhile, I'm still wailing
on this nigger's head,

29:10.798 --> 29:13.434
but his friend has got
a hold of me from behind.

29:13.468 --> 29:16.019
But I got one hand on the rail,

29:16.070 --> 29:18.238
so I ain't going nowhere.

29:18.273 --> 29:20.991
But what I don't know
is that this dude

29:21.025 --> 29:22.693
must have picked up the knife

29:22.744 --> 29:24.644
and he's trying to gut me.

29:24.646 --> 29:27.181
I felt the blood, I turned around

29:27.215 --> 29:29.166
and I bust him in the head.

29:29.200 --> 29:31.335
And he went skittering off
across the floor.

29:31.590 --> 29:35.756
And by now, somebody went and push
the button and the alarm is going.

29:35.790 --> 29:37.657
Everybody's down on the floor

29:37.675 --> 29:39.960
and we in lock down.

29:39.994 --> 29:42.129
The guard up on the rail,

29:42.163 --> 29:44.714
he got his shotgun pointed at me

29:44.716 --> 29:46.216
and he's hollering...

29:46.267 --> 29:48.969
"You! Get on the floor,
drop the weapon!"

29:49.003 --> 29:50.971
He's about to shoot me

29:51.005 --> 29:52.306
when the lieutenant tells him,

29:52.340 --> 29:56.326
"Hold your fire!
You! Throw down that club!"

29:56.328 --> 29:58.729
I looked around

29:58.780 --> 30:00.981
and I was the only one standing.

30:01.015 --> 30:03.788
I see the nigger's feet sticking out
from under the counter

30:03.798 --> 30:08.368
where he'd crawled,
so I throwed the thing down.

30:09.874 --> 30:12.242
I don't remember much after that.

30:12.293 --> 30:14.661
They-- they told me

30:14.695 --> 30:19.366
I had lost almost half my blood.

30:19.384 --> 30:25.839
I remember slipping around in it,
but I thought it was the other dude.

30:30.562 --> 30:32.062
Did the man died?

30:32.096 --> 30:35.399
No, he didn't.

30:35.433 --> 30:37.821
Everybody lived.

30:38.631 --> 30:44.224
They thought he was dead, but
he won't. He wasn't right after that.

30:44.242 --> 30:47.861
So I ain't really had
no more trouble out of him.

30:47.895 --> 30:50.948
He walked around with his head
kinda to the side,

30:50.999 --> 30:52.749
lost one eye,

30:52.784 --> 30:55.669
arm's hanging down, didn't talk right.

30:55.703 --> 30:58.956
They shipped him off to
another facility.

30:59.007 --> 31:01.174
But that's not the whole story.

31:01.209 --> 31:03.760
- No, it ain't.
- So what happened?

31:03.795 --> 31:05.629
I woke up in the infirmary.

31:05.680 --> 31:07.581
They had already done operated on me.

31:07.599 --> 31:09.883
My spleen was cut open,

31:09.917 --> 31:11.935
liver, I don't know what all.

31:11.970 --> 31:14.771
I come pretty close to dying.

31:14.806 --> 31:17.891
I had 280 stitches holding me together

31:17.925 --> 31:22.095
and, whoo, I was hurting.

31:22.113 --> 31:24.398
I didn't know you could
hurt that much.

31:24.432 --> 31:26.433
And still, they had me in leg irons

31:26.451 --> 31:29.286
and had me handcuffed to the bed,
if you can believe it.

31:29.320 --> 31:31.655
Now as I lay there,

31:31.706 --> 31:34.575
I heard this voice just as clear,

31:34.609 --> 31:36.209
couldn't have been no clearer.

31:36.244 --> 31:38.378
And the voice said,

31:38.413 --> 31:42.466
"If it was not for the grace of God,

31:42.500 --> 31:44.618
you would not be here."

31:44.636 --> 31:47.254
Man, I tried to sit up

31:47.288 --> 31:49.740
and look around, but I couldn't.

31:49.774 --> 31:52.392
Wasn't no need to no how,
'cause wasn't nobody there.

31:52.427 --> 31:54.961
I mean, there was somebody
there all right,

31:54.979 --> 31:57.648
but wasn't no need for me looking
around to see if I could see him.

31:57.682 --> 32:00.350
You don't think this is a strange
kind of story?

32:00.401 --> 32:03.403
Yeah, I do think
it's a strange kind of story.

32:03.438 --> 32:06.773
No, what I mean is, that you didn't
feel sorry for this man.

32:06.807 --> 32:08.742
Oh, you getting ahead of the story.

32:08.776 --> 32:12.029
The story of how a fellow inmate
became a crippled one-eyed halfwit

32:12.080 --> 32:13.780
so you could find God.

32:13.814 --> 32:15.549
- Whoa-ho.
- Well, isn't it?

32:15.583 --> 32:17.651
- I don't know.
- You hadn't thought of it that way?

32:17.669 --> 32:20.087
Oh yeah, hell,
I thought of it that way.

32:20.121 --> 32:22.706
Well, isn't that the true story?

32:22.757 --> 32:25.825
Look, Professor, I don't want
to get on the wrong side of you.

32:25.843 --> 32:27.827
And you seem to have a powerful wish

32:27.845 --> 32:29.496
for that to be the story,

32:29.514 --> 32:33.300
so I got to say, that is one way
of looking at it.

32:33.334 --> 32:36.219
I gotta concede that.
Gotta keep you interested.

32:36.270 --> 32:38.805
- String me along.
- You all right with that?

32:38.839 --> 32:42.025
And then put me in the...
what's it, the trick bag.

32:42.060 --> 32:43.860
- Yeah!
- Right.

32:43.895 --> 32:45.729
You got to remember,

32:45.731 --> 32:47.514
- this is a jailhouse story--
- All right.

32:47.532 --> 32:49.983
- which you specifically asked for.
- All right.

32:50.017 --> 32:51.985
The point is, Professor,

32:52.019 --> 32:54.037
I ain't got the first notion
in the world

32:54.072 --> 32:57.190
about what makes God tick.
I don'know why he spoke to me.

32:57.192 --> 32:59.242
- i know I wouldn't.
- But you listened.

32:59.293 --> 33:02.028
- What choice would you have?
- I don't know.

33:02.046 --> 33:03.914
Not listen.

33:03.965 --> 33:07.751
You think he goes around
talking to people,

33:07.802 --> 33:10.954
he knows ain't gonna listen to him
in the first place?

33:13.874 --> 33:17.210
You think he got that kind
of free time?

33:17.245 --> 33:20.180
Why is it you people
can't just accept it

33:20.182 --> 33:22.386
that some people don't even
want to believe in God?

33:23.000 --> 33:25.112
- I can accept that.
- You can?

33:25.153 --> 33:28.522
Sure I can.
Meaning I believe that to be a fact.

33:28.556 --> 33:30.991
I mean I'm looking at it every day,

33:31.025 --> 33:32.609
so I'd better accept it.

33:32.660 --> 33:34.161
Then why can't you leave us alone?

33:34.195 --> 33:37.030
Oh, to be hanging from steampipes
and all that?

33:37.064 --> 33:40.066
If that's what we want to do, yes.

33:40.084 --> 33:44.788
Because he said not to.

33:47.575 --> 33:50.143
It's in here.

33:53.881 --> 33:56.516
- Don't you want to be happy?
- Happy?

33:56.551 --> 33:58.351
What, you got something
against being happy?

33:58.386 --> 33:59.175
God help us.

33:59.185 --> 34:02.661
What, I done opened up a can of worms?
What's you got against being happy?

34:02.671 --> 34:04.357
It's contrary to the human condition.

34:04.392 --> 34:06.727
Contrary to your condition,
I gotta agree with that.

34:06.761 --> 34:07.805
Happy?

34:08.646 --> 34:12.432
What, like there ain't no such thing.
Not for nobody.

34:12.450 --> 34:13.533
No.

34:13.568 --> 34:15.569
How did we get ourselves
in such a fix as this?

34:15.603 --> 34:18.071
We were born in such a fix as this,

34:18.105 --> 34:20.841
suffering and human destiny
are the same thing.

34:20.875 --> 34:22.676
Each is a description of the other.

34:22.710 --> 34:24.411
We ain't talking about no suffering.

34:24.445 --> 34:26.046
We're talking about being happy.

34:26.080 --> 34:27.164
You can't be happy if you're in pain.

34:27.165 --> 34:28.248
Why not?

34:28.282 --> 34:29.583
You're not making any sense.

34:29.617 --> 34:32.786
Oh, them is some hard words
from the Professor.

34:32.804 --> 34:36.647
The preacher has fell back.
He's clutching his eyes.

34:36.907 --> 34:39.342
His eyes is rolled back in his head.

34:39.393 --> 34:43.463
Wait a minute. Wait a minute, folks.

34:43.708 --> 34:49.611
The preacher's blinking.
He is coming back. He is coming back.

34:50.272 --> 34:52.239
The point is, Professor,

34:52.273 --> 34:54.441
if you ain't got no pain in your life,

34:54.475 --> 34:56.976
how would you even know
when you was happy?

34:56.994 --> 34:58.278
As compared to what?

34:58.312 --> 35:00.580
You don't have anything to drink
around here, do you?

35:00.615 --> 35:03.083
No, I don't.

35:03.117 --> 35:05.018
Is you a drinking man?

35:05.052 --> 35:06.420
Are we about to get
a temperance lecture?

35:06.421 --> 35:07.788
Not from me.

35:07.822 --> 35:09.840
It's been a difficult day.

35:09.874 --> 35:11.675
I take it you don't drink.

35:11.709 --> 35:14.177
No, I don't.

35:14.212 --> 35:16.930
I've done my share of it
my time though.

35:16.964 --> 35:18.215
Are you an A.A?

35:18.266 --> 35:21.101
No, no, no A.A. I just quit.

35:22.437 --> 35:25.222
I'd a lot of friends who were drinkers
though, most of them for that matter.

35:26.109 --> 35:27.902
- Most of them dead too.
- From drinking?

35:28.392 --> 35:31.278
Well, from drinking and reasons
not too far from it.

35:31.312 --> 35:35.014
I had a friend get run down not
too long ago by a taxicab.

35:35.032 --> 35:37.751
Now where you think
he was headed drunk?

35:37.785 --> 35:39.536
I don't know. Where was he going?

35:39.570 --> 35:41.838
To get more whisky.

35:41.840 --> 35:43.657
He had plenty at the house,

35:43.691 --> 35:46.376
but drunks are always scared
they're gonna run out.

35:46.410 --> 35:47.878
Was he killed?

35:47.912 --> 35:49.696
I hope so. We buried him.

35:49.714 --> 35:52.299
I supposed there's a moral
to this story.

35:54.385 --> 35:57.504
Just a story about what you get,
what you want.

35:57.538 --> 35:59.656
Pain-- happiness.

36:03.377 --> 36:06.847
Let me tell you another one.

36:06.881 --> 36:08.865
One Sunday,

36:08.900 --> 36:13.052
we's all sitting around the house,
drinking-- a Sunday morning.

36:13.070 --> 36:15.722
Well, here comes this friend
of our with his girl, Evelyn.

36:15.740 --> 36:18.391
Now Evelyn was drunk
when she got there,

36:18.425 --> 36:20.327
but we told her

36:20.361 --> 36:22.028
get yourself a stiff drink.

36:22.062 --> 36:28.174
Well, directly, my buddy Reg, he go in
the kitchen to fix his self a drink.

36:30.400 --> 36:32.990
Only now, the bottle is gone.

36:33.687 --> 36:36.527
Now, Reg has been around
a few drinking people in his time

36:36.537 --> 36:38.178
commences to hunt for the bottle.

36:38.212 --> 36:40.547
He looks in the cabinet,
looks behind everything,

36:40.581 --> 36:42.132
but he can't find it.

36:42.134 --> 36:44.250
Of course he knows what's
happened to it.

36:44.268 --> 36:46.753
So he comes back in the living room,
sat down,

36:46.771 --> 36:50.150
looks at Evelyn sitting there on
the sofa drunk as a goat.

36:50.160 --> 36:53.654
And he says,
"Evelyn, where you put the whisky?"

36:54.500 --> 36:59.013
And Evelyn says... ( slurring )

36:59.613 --> 37:04.110
He says, "Evelyn. where did you
hide the whisky?"

37:05.000 --> 37:09.044
She says... ( slurring )

37:09.577 --> 37:12.545
Well, Reg is sitting there and this
is beginng to piss him off a little,

37:12.546 --> 37:18.028
so he gets on her face and he says,
( slurring )

37:18.619 --> 37:19.953
And she said,

37:19.971 --> 37:21.972
"I hid it in the toilet."

37:29.463 --> 37:30.597
That's pretty funny.

37:30.631 --> 37:32.232
Oh, I thought you'd like that.

37:32.266 --> 37:33.967
And is that where the whisky was?

37:33.985 --> 37:35.652
Oh, yeah yeah. That's a favorite
place for drunks

37:35.686 --> 37:37.570
to hide the bottle.

37:37.605 --> 37:40.573
But the point,
is that the drunk's concern

37:40.608 --> 37:43.860
ain't that he's going to die from
drinking, which he is--

37:43.911 --> 37:46.279
but that he's going to
run out of whisky

37:46.313 --> 37:48.348
before he get a chance to do it.

37:48.382 --> 37:50.033
Is you hungry?

37:50.084 --> 37:52.285
'Cause I can come back to this.
I ain't gonna lose my place.

37:52.319 --> 37:53.820
No, I'm all right. Go ahead.

37:53.838 --> 37:56.089
If you was to hand a drunk a drink

37:56.123 --> 37:58.458
and tell him, you don't want it,
what do you think he'd say?

37:58.492 --> 38:00.126
I think I know what he would say.

38:00.160 --> 38:01.761
Sure you do. And you would be right.

38:01.796 --> 38:03.380
- About him not really wanting it?
- Yes.

38:03.431 --> 38:06.216
Because what he wants he can't get,
or thinks he can't get,

38:06.267 --> 38:09.219
so what he really don't want,
he can't enough of.

38:09.270 --> 38:11.104
So what is it he really wants?

38:11.138 --> 38:13.473
Well, you know what he really wants.

38:13.507 --> 38:14.691
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

38:14.725 --> 38:16.109
No, I don't.

38:16.143 --> 38:18.111
You don't know what he wants?

38:18.145 --> 38:19.813
No, I do not.

38:19.847 --> 38:22.348
He wants what everybody wants.

38:22.366 --> 38:23.483
And that is?

38:23.517 --> 38:25.184
He wants to be loved by God.

38:25.202 --> 38:27.037
Ha! Ha! I don't want to
be loved by God.

38:27.071 --> 38:29.456
See, I love that.
I love the way you cut right to it.

38:29.490 --> 38:31.624
See, he don't either,
according to him.

38:31.659 --> 38:34.411
All he wants is to drank a whisky.

38:36.213 --> 38:38.248
Doesn't that tell me, which one
makes sense and which one don't.

38:38.299 --> 38:39.916
I don't want a drink of whisky either.

38:39.967 --> 38:41.534
I thought you just got down
asking for one.

38:41.552 --> 38:43.336
I mean as a general proposition.

38:43.370 --> 38:44.688
We ain't talking about no
general proposition.

38:44.689 --> 38:46.006
We're talking about a drink.

38:46.040 --> 38:48.558
- I don't have a drinking problem.
- You got some kind of problem.

38:48.592 --> 38:51.061
Well, whatever kind of problem I have,
it is not something

38:51.095 --> 38:53.713
that I imagine can be addressed
with a drink of liquor.

38:53.731 --> 38:57.434
Mm! I love the way you put that.

38:57.485 --> 38:59.436
Well, what can it be addressed with?

38:59.487 --> 39:02.555
I think you know what
it can be addressed with.

39:02.573 --> 39:04.524
The Sunset Limited.

39:06.560 --> 39:08.495
- That's what you really want.
- Yes.

39:08.529 --> 39:11.064
That is what I want, yes.

39:12.566 --> 39:14.951
Well, that's a mighty big
drink of whisky, Professor.

39:15.002 --> 39:17.570
- That I don't really want?
- That you don't really want, yes.

39:17.588 --> 39:20.423
- Well, I think I do want it.
- Of course you do, honey.

39:20.458 --> 39:22.092
If you didn't,
we wouldn't be sitting here.

39:22.126 --> 39:23.626
I disagree with you.

39:23.677 --> 39:25.628
All right, but that's the
hand I'm playing.

39:25.679 --> 39:27.947
I don't think you understand
that people such as myself

39:27.982 --> 39:30.917
look upon this yearning for God
as something lacking in these people.

39:30.935 --> 39:33.386
Sure I do. I couldn't agree more.

39:33.421 --> 39:34.587
You agree with that?

39:34.589 --> 39:38.141
Yes. What's lacking is God.

39:38.192 --> 39:41.361
I am sorry, but to me this whole idea
of God is just a load of crap.

39:41.395 --> 39:44.030
Oh Lord have mercy!

39:44.065 --> 39:45.698
Jesus help us.

39:45.733 --> 39:48.768
The Professor's done gone and
blasphemed all overs.

39:48.786 --> 39:51.437
We ain't never gonna be save now.

39:53.290 --> 39:55.208
You don't find that an
evil thing to say?

39:55.242 --> 39:58.111
No, Professor, I don't. But you does.

39:58.129 --> 39:59.796
No, I don't. It's simply a fact.

39:59.830 --> 40:01.381
No, it ain't simply no fact.

40:01.415 --> 40:02.895
That's the biggest fact about you.

40:03.048 --> 40:05.536
In fact, it might just be
the only fact.

40:05.890 --> 40:06.857
But you don't seem to think it so bad.

40:07.221 --> 40:09.622
No, 'cause I know it to be curable.

40:09.640 --> 40:11.624
Now if you're asking me

40:11.642 --> 40:14.293
what the man up there thinks about it,

40:14.311 --> 40:17.597
well, I imagine he done
heard it so much

40:17.631 --> 40:20.133
that it don't bother him
all that much.

40:20.151 --> 40:22.135
I mean,

40:22.153 --> 40:25.021
what if somebody told you
you didn't exist

40:25.055 --> 40:26.706
and you was sitting right there

40:26.740 --> 40:29.042
listening to him say it?

40:29.076 --> 40:31.027
That wouldn't piss you off, would it?

40:31.078 --> 40:32.946
No, you'd just feel sorry for them.

40:32.980 --> 40:35.081
Right, and you might even try to
get some help for them.

40:35.116 --> 40:38.501
Now in my case
he had to holler out loud,

40:38.536 --> 40:41.671
me laying on a slab in two pieces,

40:41.705 --> 40:43.790
sewed back together
where some nigger done tried

40:43.824 --> 40:45.508
to core me like an apple.

40:45.543 --> 40:49.512
But God being God,

40:49.547 --> 40:52.632
he can speak to your heart
at any time.

40:52.666 --> 40:55.334
And furthermore, if he spoke to me--

40:55.352 --> 40:57.303
which he did--

40:57.337 --> 41:00.173
he can speak to anybody.

41:16.857 --> 41:19.325
"Wonder what this crazy nigger's

41:19.360 --> 41:21.728
fixing to do now.

41:21.762 --> 41:24.130
He's liable to put the mojo on me.

41:24.165 --> 41:27.800
He'll be speaking in tongues
here directly.

41:27.835 --> 41:31.004
I need to get my ass out of here.

41:31.038 --> 41:33.706
He's liable to steal my pocketbook.

41:33.724 --> 41:37.427
I need to get my ass
on down to that depot

41:37.478 --> 41:40.379
'fore something bad happens to me."

41:41.732 --> 41:44.934
Hey!

41:44.985 --> 41:47.604
What are we gonna do with you,
Professor?

41:47.655 --> 41:50.056
Look, I know I owe you a great deal,

41:50.074 --> 41:52.391
at least in the eyes of the world.

41:52.409 --> 41:55.278
Couldn't I just give you something
and we could call it square?

41:57.010 --> 42:01.567
I'll give you some money,
something like.. I can give you $1000.

42:01.585 --> 42:03.086
Well, that's not very much, I guess.

42:03.120 --> 42:04.704
I can give you $3000, say.

42:04.738 --> 42:07.140
You ain't got no notion of
the trouble you're in, do you?

42:07.174 --> 42:09.125
- I don't know what you mean.
- I know you don't.

42:09.159 --> 42:11.461
I'd just like to
settle this in some way.

42:11.512 --> 42:13.513
Ain't me you got to settle with.

42:13.547 --> 42:16.516
Do you really think
I was sent to you by God?

42:16.550 --> 42:18.851
No, it's worse than that.

42:20.808 --> 42:26.392
- What do you mean?
- Belief ain't like unbelief.

42:26.426 --> 42:28.377
If you're a believer

42:28.379 --> 42:31.948
and you finally got to come
to the well of belief itself,

42:31.982 --> 42:35.268
then you ain't got to look further.
They ain't no further.

42:35.286 --> 42:37.403
But the unbeliever's got a problem.

42:37.437 --> 42:39.438
He's set out to unravel the world.

42:39.456 --> 42:41.791
For everything he can point to
that ain't true,

42:41.825 --> 42:43.793
he leaves two things laying there.

42:53.220 --> 42:56.455
Do you really believe everything
that's in there-- the Bible?

42:56.473 --> 42:58.758
The literal truth?

42:58.792 --> 43:00.093
Yes!

43:00.127 --> 43:04.314
Probably not, but they already
know I'm an outlaw.

43:04.348 --> 43:08.234
What is it you would disagree with?

43:08.269 --> 43:10.303
Probably the notion of original sin--

43:10.321 --> 43:12.772
You know, when Eve ate the apple,

43:12.774 --> 43:14.691
turned everybody bad.

43:14.742 --> 43:16.693
I don't see people that way.

43:16.744 --> 43:18.695
I think for the most part

43:18.746 --> 43:20.813
people was good to begin with.

43:20.831 --> 43:24.000
I think evil is something you bring
on your ownself,

43:24.034 --> 43:26.252
most of them from wanting things
you ain't suppose to have.

43:26.287 --> 43:28.788
But I ain't gonna stand here and
tell you about me being a heretic

43:28.822 --> 43:30.823
when'm trying to get you
to quit being one.

43:30.841 --> 43:32.792
Are you a heretic?

43:32.826 --> 43:35.628
Is you trying to put me
in the trick bag, Professor?

43:35.662 --> 43:37.297
No, I'm not.

43:37.331 --> 43:38.581
Are you?

43:42.936 --> 43:46.055
No more than what a man ought to be,

43:46.106 --> 43:50.109
even a man with a powerful believer.

43:50.144 --> 43:53.780
I ain't a doubter,
but I am questioning.

43:53.848 --> 43:59.319
- What's the difference?
- A questioner wants the truth.

43:59.353 --> 44:03.189
A doubter wants to be told
there ain't no such thing.

44:03.207 --> 44:05.382
You don't think you have to believe
everything that's in there

44:05.383 --> 44:08.027
- in order to be saved?
- No, not at all.

44:08.045 --> 44:10.246
I don't even think you
have to read it.

44:10.297 --> 44:12.248
I ain't even for sure you
even got to know

44:12.299 --> 44:13.750
there is such a book.

44:13.801 --> 44:16.753
I think whatever truth
is wrote in the pages of this book

44:16.804 --> 44:19.422
is wrote in the human heart too,
and was wrote there a long time ago,

44:19.473 --> 44:21.758
and will be wrote there
a long time hence,

44:21.809 --> 44:24.977
even if every copy of this book
is burned-- every copy of it.

44:25.012 --> 44:28.214
And what Jesus said--
I don't think he made up a word of it.

44:28.232 --> 44:29.766
He just told it.

44:29.817 --> 44:31.684
This book is a guide

44:31.718 --> 44:33.886
for the ignorant and
the sick at heart.

44:33.904 --> 44:35.738
A whole man wouldn't need it at all.

44:35.773 --> 44:37.479
And if you was to read this book,

44:37.705 --> 44:40.774
you're gonna find there's more
talking here about the wrong way

44:40.861 --> 44:43.072
than there is the right way.
Why is it?

44:43.247 --> 44:44.614
I don't know. Why is it?

44:44.665 --> 44:46.032
Why don't you tell me?

44:46.066 --> 44:48.501
I'd have to think about it.

44:48.535 --> 44:49.619
- Okay.
- Okay what?

44:49.670 --> 44:51.371
Okay, go on and think about it.

44:51.405 --> 44:54.207
It might take me a little longer than
you to think about something.

44:54.241 --> 44:56.592
- That's all right.
- That's all right?

44:56.627 --> 44:59.545
Yeah. I mean, I can take that
statement in one or two ways.

44:59.579 --> 45:01.848
I'm going to take it the good way
'cause that's my nature.

45:01.882 --> 45:03.883
That way I got to live
in my world and not yours.

45:03.917 --> 45:05.685
What makes you think mine is so bad?

45:05.719 --> 45:08.284
I don't think it's so bad.
I just know it's brief.

45:09.850 --> 45:10.556
All right.

45:10.590 --> 45:13.059
I think the answer to your question is

45:13.093 --> 45:14.894
that the dialect of the Kamahadileo

45:14.928 --> 45:17.029
always presupposes a ground of evil.

45:17.064 --> 45:19.015
- Man.
- How's that?

45:19.049 --> 45:21.567
That's strong as a mare's
breath, Professor.

45:21.601 --> 45:23.069
Why wouldn't I love

45:23.103 --> 45:25.738
to lay some shit like that
on the brothers.

45:25.772 --> 45:29.742
it's just the two of us sitting here
in private, talking.

45:29.776 --> 45:31.994
What'd you just say?

45:33.997 --> 45:37.083
The Bible is full
of cautionary tales--

45:37.117 --> 45:38.801
all of literature, for that matter--

45:38.836 --> 45:41.587
telling us to be careful.
Careful of what?

45:41.621 --> 45:43.589
Taking the wrong turn, the wrong path.

45:43.623 --> 45:45.475
How many wrong paths are there?

45:45.509 --> 45:47.477
Their number is legion.

45:47.511 --> 45:49.645
How many right paths? Just one.

45:49.680 --> 45:53.316
Hence the imbalance that you spoke of.

45:53.350 --> 45:55.351
Man.

45:55.402 --> 45:57.422
You know you could go on TV,
Professor,

45:57.432 --> 45:59.084
good looking man like yourself,
you know that.

45:59.152 --> 46:01.403
- Stop.
- I'm serious.

46:01.710 --> 46:04.911
I wasn't even sure you was a Professor
till you laid that shit on me.

46:04.945 --> 46:06.829
Now I think you're having fun
at my expense.

46:06.864 --> 46:08.647
- No, I ain't.
- Well, I think you are.

46:08.665 --> 46:11.083
Honey, I swear I ain't.

46:11.804 --> 46:15.532
I couldn't say a thing like you
just got done saying. I admire it.

46:15.539 --> 46:17.173
And why do you keep calling me honey?

46:17.207 --> 46:19.376
That's just the old South talking.

46:19.377 --> 46:21.544
It don't mean nothing.
I'll try to stop if it bothers you.

46:21.595 --> 46:24.680
- I'm just not sure what it means.
- It means you're among friends.

46:24.715 --> 46:26.632
It mean quit worrying
about everything...

46:26.666 --> 46:28.718
That might be easier said than done.

46:28.769 --> 46:30.686
Yeah... you're right, it might

46:30.721 --> 46:33.189
but we're just talking-- talking.

46:36.310 --> 46:38.361
- Tell me something.
- Sure.

46:38.395 --> 46:41.013
Why are you here?
What do you get out of this?

46:41.031 --> 46:42.465
You seem like a smart man.

46:42.499 --> 46:44.350
Me?

46:44.368 --> 46:46.986
I'm just a dumb country nigger
from Louisiana.

46:46.988 --> 46:49.405
I ain't told you. I never have
the first thought in my head.

46:49.456 --> 46:53.025
if it ain't in here, I don't know it.

46:53.043 --> 46:55.628
Sometimes I think
you're having fun with me.

46:57.130 --> 47:00.967
<i>You're an asshole.
A-s-s hole! Asshole!</i>

47:02.653 --> 47:05.421
<i>Now what the fuck are you doing
in my motherfucking bed?</i>

47:08.759 --> 47:10.393
I don't see how you can live here.

47:10.427 --> 47:11.844
I don't know how you can feel safe.

47:11.879 --> 47:14.564
Well, you got a point, Professor,
about being safe anyway.

47:14.598 --> 47:17.049
You ever stopped any of these
people from taking drugs?

47:17.067 --> 47:19.068
Not that I know of.

47:19.102 --> 47:21.354
Then what is the point?
I don't get it.

47:21.388 --> 47:24.390
I mean, it's hopeless. This places is
a moral leper colony.

47:24.408 --> 47:26.576
Damn.

47:26.610 --> 47:29.829
Moral leper colony.
Where's my pencil at?

47:29.863 --> 47:32.782
I ain't never gonna want you to leave.
Put this in my book.

47:35.869 --> 47:37.336
I like the sound of that.

47:39.873 --> 47:41.791
I still don't see
how you can live here.

47:41.842 --> 47:45.578
Why not go someplace where you
can do the world some good?

47:45.596 --> 47:48.431
As opposed to someplace
where good is needed?

47:48.465 --> 47:50.299
Even God gives up at some point.

47:50.350 --> 47:52.168
There's no ministry in hell
I've ever heard of.

47:52.202 --> 47:54.971
No, there ain't. And that's well put.

47:55.022 --> 47:57.139
Ministry is for the living.

47:57.190 --> 47:59.425
That's why you're responsible
for your brother.

47:59.443 --> 48:01.394
Once he quit breathing
you can't help him no more.

48:01.428 --> 48:02.895
He's in the hands of other parties.

48:02.929 --> 48:04.864
So you got to look after him now.

48:04.898 --> 48:08.067
You might even want to monitor
his train schedule.

48:08.101 --> 48:09.768
You think you're your brother keeper?

48:09.786 --> 48:11.837
No, I don't believe think
quite cover it.

48:11.872 --> 48:13.372
And Jesus is part of this enterprise?

48:13.407 --> 48:15.308
That all right with you?

48:15.342 --> 48:17.743
And he's interested in coming
here to this cesspool

48:17.777 --> 48:20.446
and salvaging what everybody knows
is unsalvageable.

48:20.464 --> 48:23.466
Why would he do that? You said
he didn't have a lot of free time.

48:23.500 --> 48:25.384
Why would he come here?

48:25.419 --> 48:28.120
What would the difference be to him

48:28.138 --> 48:30.756
between a building that was
spiritually and morally vacant

48:30.790 --> 48:32.341
and one that was just plain empty?

48:32.392 --> 48:36.462
Mm, Professor, you're a theologian
here and I ain't even know it.

48:36.480 --> 48:38.864
You're being facetious.

48:38.899 --> 48:40.816
I don't know that word.

48:40.851 --> 48:42.602
But don't be afraid to
talk down to me.

48:42.636 --> 48:44.403
You ain't here to hurt my feelings.

48:44.438 --> 48:46.072
It means-- I guess it means

48:46.106 --> 48:47.940
you're not being sincere,
that you're being--

48:47.974 --> 48:50.976
you don't mean what you're saying
in a cynical sort of way.

48:50.994 --> 48:52.745
Mm, you don't think I mean what I say?

48:52.779 --> 48:55.314
I think you say things
for effect sometimes.

48:55.332 --> 48:58.150
Mm, well, let me say this for effect.

48:58.168 --> 48:59.502
Go ahead.

48:59.536 --> 49:01.487
Suppose I was to tell you

49:01.505 --> 49:04.707
that if you could bring yourself to
unlatch your hands

49:04.758 --> 49:06.492
from around your brother's throat,

49:06.510 --> 49:09.128
you could have life everlasting?

49:09.162 --> 49:11.013
There's no such thing. Everybody dies.

49:11.048 --> 49:12.515
That ain't what he said.

49:12.549 --> 49:17.336
He said you could have
life everlasting,

49:17.354 --> 49:20.339
have it now, today,

49:20.357 --> 49:23.225
hold it in your hands,

49:23.276 --> 49:25.678
see it. It gives off a light,

49:25.696 --> 49:30.299
got a little weight to it-- not much.

49:30.334 --> 49:34.537
Warm to the touch just a little--

49:34.571 --> 49:38.541
Life, and it's forever.

49:38.575 --> 49:41.026
And you can have it

49:41.044 --> 49:44.163
now, today.

49:44.197 --> 49:45.915
But you don't want it.

49:45.966 --> 49:48.156
You don't want it 'cause to get it,

49:48.639 --> 49:50.084
you've got to let your
brother off the hook.

49:50.284 --> 49:54.299
You've got to actually take him
in your arms and hold him

49:54.566 --> 49:57.295
and it don't matter what color he is,
or what he smells like

49:57.345 --> 49:59.261
or even if he don't want to be held.

49:59.312 --> 50:01.347
And you won't do it

50:01.381 --> 50:03.549
'cause you don't think he deserved it.

50:03.567 --> 50:05.384
And about that
there ain't no argument.

50:05.402 --> 50:07.553
He don't!

50:07.571 --> 50:09.572
You won't do it 'cause it ain't just.

50:09.606 --> 50:11.574
Ain't that so?

50:11.608 --> 50:14.026
Ain't it?

50:14.060 --> 50:15.728
I don't think in those terms.

50:15.746 --> 50:19.131
Just answer the question, Professor.

50:19.166 --> 50:20.950
I don't believe in that sort of thing.

50:21.001 --> 50:24.870
I know you don't.
Just answer the question.

50:24.904 --> 50:28.874
There may be some truth
in what you say.

50:28.909 --> 50:30.593
That's all I'm going to get?

50:30.627 --> 50:31.794
Yes.

50:31.845 --> 50:33.746
All right, all right. I'll take it.

50:33.764 --> 50:36.549
Some is a lot.
We down to breadcrumbs here.

50:36.583 --> 50:37.767
I really have to go home.

50:37.801 --> 50:40.052
No, no, no, just stay, just a little.

50:40.086 --> 50:42.104
We can talk about something else.

50:42.139 --> 50:43.973
You like baseball?

50:45.425 --> 50:47.943
Tell you what-- why don't I fix us
something to eat?

50:47.978 --> 50:50.696
- I'm not hungry.
- How about some coffee?

50:50.731 --> 50:52.481
All right.

50:52.532 --> 50:54.233
But then I really have to go.

50:54.267 --> 50:57.403
All right. The man says all right.

51:03.894 --> 51:07.830
You know,
ordinarily I wouldn't be this rude--

51:07.881 --> 51:10.382
A man come into my house,
sit at my table...

51:10.384 --> 51:12.334
me not offering nothing.

51:12.385 --> 51:15.821
But with you, I got to strategize,

51:15.856 --> 51:17.840
play the cards right,

51:17.891 --> 51:19.958
keeping you from slipping off
into the night.

51:19.976 --> 51:21.960
It's not night.

51:21.978 --> 51:24.263
Depends on what kind of night
you're talking about.

51:24.297 --> 51:26.465
Let me ask you a kind of
personal question.

51:26.483 --> 51:28.851
This will be good.

51:28.853 --> 51:32.071
What you think is wrong with you

51:32.105 --> 51:35.441
that you finally narrowed all your
choices down to the Sunset Limited?

51:35.475 --> 51:37.309
I don't think there's
anything wrong with me.

51:37.327 --> 51:39.662
I think I've just been driven to
finally face the truth.

51:39.696 --> 51:41.447
If I'm different it doesn't mean
I'm crazy.

51:41.481 --> 51:42.531
- Different?
- Yeah.

51:42.582 --> 51:44.166
- Different from who?
- Anybody.

51:44.201 --> 51:46.285
What about all them other folk out
there trying to off themself?

51:46.319 --> 51:47.387
- What about 'em?
- Well, maybe them's

51:47.388 --> 51:48.454
the folk you would like.

51:48.488 --> 51:49.704
Maybe they're your natural kin,

51:49.705 --> 51:51.262
only y'all don't get together
all that much.

51:51.424 --> 51:53.008
- I don't think so.
- Don't think so?

51:53.043 --> 51:55.327
No, I've been in group therapy
with those people.

51:55.345 --> 51:57.930
I've never found anyone there that
I felt any kinship with.

51:57.964 --> 52:00.966
Hmm, what about all them professors?
There ain't no kinship there?

52:01.000 --> 52:03.719
- Good God.
- I'll take that as a no.

52:03.770 --> 52:05.688
I loathe them and they loathe me.

52:05.690 --> 52:08.357
Well, just 'cause you don't like them,

52:08.391 --> 52:10.559
don't mean you ain't like them.

52:10.610 --> 52:12.278
And what's that word "loathe"?

52:12.312 --> 52:13.339
Loathe.

52:13.340 --> 52:14.730
That a pretty powerful word, ain't it?

52:14.781 --> 52:16.181
Not powerful enough, I'm afraid.

52:16.199 --> 52:18.317
How come you be loathing
these other professors?

52:18.351 --> 52:20.486
- I know what you're thinking.
- What am I thinking?

52:20.520 --> 52:23.122
You're thinking that I loathe them
because I'm like them,

52:23.156 --> 52:24.540
and I loathe myself.

52:24.574 --> 52:27.025
Let me ask you this--

52:27.043 --> 52:29.027
is you on any kind of medication?

52:29.045 --> 52:30.830
- No.
- There ain't no medication

52:30.864 --> 52:32.665
for pilgrims out there waiting
to take the Limited?

52:32.699 --> 52:34.633
- For suicidal depression?
- Yeah.

52:34.668 --> 52:36.802
- Yeah, there is. I've tried them.
- And what happened?

52:36.837 --> 52:38.370
- Nothing happened.
- You ain't get no relief?

52:38.388 --> 52:40.890
- No. Your coffee's percolated.
- Yeah, I know.

52:40.924 --> 52:43.759
Does these drugs work for
other people?

52:43.810 --> 52:45.728
Yes, for most.

52:45.762 --> 52:47.897
- But not for you?
- Not for me, no.

52:47.931 --> 52:50.065
Hmm, what you make of that?

52:50.100 --> 52:51.267
I don't know what am I
supposed to make of it?

52:51.287 --> 52:52.538
I don't know Professor.

52:52.548 --> 52:56.271
I'm just trying to see if we can find
find you some constituents out here.

52:56.273 --> 52:58.274
- Constituents?
- Yeah! You like that?

52:58.325 --> 53:00.276
Is that the word they used
on the streets?

53:00.327 --> 53:02.695
No, I learned that word
in the jailhouse.

53:02.729 --> 53:05.447
You hear things from the
jailhouse lawyer

53:05.449 --> 53:07.416
and then it gets used around.

53:07.450 --> 53:09.952
Be talking about your constituents,

53:09.986 --> 53:12.755
some other cat's constituents,

53:12.789 --> 53:16.926
your wife's constituents.
You take cream and sugar?

53:16.960 --> 53:18.294
No, just black.

53:18.345 --> 53:19.845
Just black.

53:23.750 --> 53:28.721
Why do I have to have constituents?

53:28.755 --> 53:30.756
I ain't saying you got to, Professor.

53:30.774 --> 53:32.308
I'm just wondering if maybe you do

53:32.359 --> 53:34.193
and we just ain't looked
hard enough for them.

53:34.227 --> 53:36.896
I mean, they could be out there.
There could be some other

53:36.930 --> 53:39.264
drug-proof terminal commuters out
there, could be your friends.

53:39.282 --> 53:41.500
- Terminal commuters?
- Mm-hmm, you like the sound of that?

53:41.534 --> 53:43.819
It's all right.

53:43.870 --> 53:45.103
Nobody?

53:45.121 --> 53:47.206
- Nobody, no.
- Hmm.

53:47.240 --> 53:49.608
I'm not a member. Never wanted
to be and never was.

53:49.626 --> 53:51.606
- Not a member?
- No.

53:52.545 --> 53:54.546
Look, I could eat a bite.

53:54.581 --> 54:00.586
And I think you could too.

54:00.620 --> 54:03.255
You break bread with a man,

54:03.289 --> 54:05.925
you've moved on to another level
of friendship.

54:05.959 --> 54:08.644
I heard that's true the world over.

54:08.678 --> 54:09.929
Probably.

54:09.963 --> 54:11.463
Probably?

54:11.481 --> 54:13.182
I like probably.

54:13.233 --> 54:15.184
Probably from you is worth

54:15.235 --> 54:17.019
a couple of damn rights anywhere else.

54:17.070 --> 54:19.154
Why? Because I don't
believe in anything?

54:19.189 --> 54:23.141
Well, I don't think that's
the problem.

54:23.159 --> 54:26.028
I think it's what you do believe

54:26.079 --> 54:27.579
that's carrying you off,

54:27.614 --> 54:30.616
not what you don't.

54:30.650 --> 54:32.651
Let me ask you this.

54:32.669 --> 54:34.319
Go ahead.

54:34.337 --> 54:36.288
You ever think about Jesus?

54:36.322 --> 54:37.456
Here we go.

54:39.509 --> 54:42.711
What makes you think I'm not Jewish?

54:42.762 --> 54:45.047
What, Jews ain't allowed
to think about Jesus?

54:45.098 --> 54:47.299
No, but they might think
about him differently.

54:48.601 --> 54:50.052
Is you Jewish?

54:50.103 --> 54:51.637
No, as it happens I'm not.

54:51.671 --> 54:53.806
Had me going there for a minute.

54:53.840 --> 54:55.691
What, you don't like Jews?

54:55.725 --> 54:58.143
I thought of pulling your chain,
Professor.

54:58.177 --> 55:00.145
Just pulling your chain.

55:00.179 --> 55:03.198
I don't know why
I like to mess with you,

55:03.233 --> 55:06.184
but I do.

55:06.202 --> 55:08.654
Now you need to listen

55:08.688 --> 55:10.572
or you need to believe
what you're hearing,

55:10.623 --> 55:12.458
'cause the point of where
this is going

55:12.492 --> 55:14.326
which you wanted to know is--

55:14.702 --> 55:15.812
that there ain't no Jews,

55:15.813 --> 55:17.883
there  ain't no whites,
there ain't no niggers...

55:18.152 --> 55:20.992
people of color.
There ain't none of that.

55:21.468 --> 55:23.419
At the deep bottom of the mine
where the gold is at,

55:26.006 --> 55:28.307
it's just the pure ore that

55:28.341 --> 55:30.208
forever thing

55:30.226 --> 55:31.927
that you don't think is there,

55:31.978 --> 55:34.596
that thing that keeps people
nailed down to the platform

55:34.647 --> 55:36.548
when the Sunset Limited
is coming through,

55:36.566 --> 55:38.517
even if they think
they want to get aboard,

55:38.551 --> 55:40.903
that thing that allows you

55:40.937 --> 55:42.938
to ladle out benediction

55:42.989 --> 55:44.990
on the heads of strangers

55:45.025 --> 55:47.076
instead of curses.

55:47.110 --> 55:49.111
And it's all one thing.

55:49.162 --> 55:52.297
And it ain't but one thing, just one.

55:52.332 --> 55:53.866
And that would be Jesus.

55:53.900 --> 55:57.036
I got to think about how
to answer that.

56:02.792 --> 56:05.794
Maybe one more heresy won't hurt you.

56:05.845 --> 56:08.881
Pretty loaded up on them already.

56:08.915 --> 56:11.467
Here's what I would say.

56:11.518 --> 56:12.684
I would say--

56:12.719 --> 56:14.586
Mmm!

56:14.604 --> 56:16.755
I would say

56:16.773 --> 56:19.224
that thing we're
talking about is Jesus,

56:19.258 --> 56:21.060
but Jesus as understood

56:21.094 --> 56:23.529
as that gold at the bottom
of the mine.

56:23.563 --> 56:25.781
He could not come down here

56:25.815 --> 56:27.933
and assume the shape of a man

56:27.951 --> 56:31.653
and if that form was not done
shaped to accommodate him.

56:31.704 --> 56:34.289
And if I said ain't no way for
Jesus to be every man

56:34.324 --> 56:35.991
without every man being Jesus,

56:36.042 --> 56:38.944
well now, I think that would be
a pretty big heresy.

56:38.962 --> 56:41.046
But that's all right.
It ain't as big a heresy

56:41.081 --> 56:44.049
as saying like man ain't
no different from a rock,

56:44.084 --> 56:46.468
which is how I see your point of view.

56:46.503 --> 56:48.954
It's not my point of view. I believe
in the primacy of the intellect.

56:48.972 --> 56:50.622
Mm, and what's that word?

56:50.640 --> 56:53.392
Primacy? It means first.
It means what you put first.

56:53.426 --> 56:56.311
And that would be intellect?

56:56.346 --> 56:57.896
Yes.

56:57.931 --> 57:00.015
Well, what about the primacy of
the Sunset Limited?

57:00.066 --> 57:01.600
Yes, that too.

57:01.634 --> 57:04.937
But not the primacy of the people
waiting on a later train?

57:04.971 --> 57:07.773
No, no primacy there.

57:07.807 --> 57:11.160
Hmm.

57:11.194 --> 57:13.612
You tough, Professor.

57:13.646 --> 57:16.498
You tough.

57:19.452 --> 57:22.254
You see yourself as a questioner.

57:22.288 --> 57:25.324
But about that, I got my doubts.

57:25.358 --> 57:29.344
The quest of your life is your quest.

57:29.379 --> 57:31.546
And you're on the road that you laid.

57:31.548 --> 57:34.967
And that fact alone might be all the
reason you need for sticking to it.

57:35.001 --> 57:38.137
As long as you're on that road,
you can't get lost.

57:38.171 --> 57:40.672
I'm not sure I understand
what you're saying.

57:40.690 --> 57:43.308
Oh, I got my doubts about
you not understanding

57:43.342 --> 57:45.677
either anything I say, Professor.

57:45.950 --> 57:50.983
I'm gonna say grace. Lord,
we thank you for this food

57:51.017 --> 57:54.236
and for the many blessings
we have received from your hand.

57:54.287 --> 57:55.663
We thank you for the life
of the Professor

57:55.664 --> 57:56.889
which you have returned to us

57:57.021 --> 58:00.232
and ask that you would look after
him 'cause we need him.

58:01.000 --> 58:02.213
I don't know why we need him.

58:03.261 --> 58:04.362
I just know we do.

58:04.380 --> 58:06.999
Amen.

58:07.033 --> 58:09.051
Tell me how you like this.

58:09.085 --> 58:14.973
It looks good.

58:15.008 --> 58:16.592
This is good.

58:19.729 --> 58:22.181
This is very good.

58:22.215 --> 58:24.349
Supposed to be good.
It's soul food, my man.

58:24.383 --> 58:26.602
It's got what in it? Molasses?

58:26.653 --> 58:28.437
- Mm, you a chef, Professor?
- Not really.

58:28.488 --> 58:29.905
- But some?
- Some, yes.

58:29.939 --> 58:33.242
Bananas, of course. Mangos?

58:33.276 --> 58:36.394
- Got a mango or two in it, rutabagas.
- Rutabagas?

58:36.412 --> 58:38.614
Rutabagas. Them's hard to find.

58:38.665 --> 58:40.616
It's very good.

58:40.667 --> 58:43.835
You know, it gets better
after a day or two.

58:43.870 --> 58:45.754
I just fixed this last night.

58:45.788 --> 58:48.573
You gotta heat it up a few times
to get the flavors right.

58:48.591 --> 58:49.708
Like chili.

58:49.742 --> 58:51.510
Like chili. Yeah, that's right.

58:51.544 --> 58:53.545
You know where I learned to fix this?

58:53.579 --> 58:55.080
- In Louisiana?
- Mm-mm.

58:55.098 --> 58:57.716
Right here in the ghettos
of New York City.

58:57.750 --> 59:01.386
There's a lot of different
influences in a dish like this.

59:01.420 --> 59:03.222
Many parts of the world
in that pot over yonder,

59:03.256 --> 59:05.307
a lot of different countries,
different people.

59:05.358 --> 59:06.975
Any white people?

59:07.026 --> 59:08.560
Not if you can help it.

59:08.562 --> 59:09.811
Really...

59:09.862 --> 59:11.697
I'm just messing with you, Professor,

59:11.731 --> 59:13.431
just messing with you.

59:13.449 --> 59:15.450
You know them chefs
in them uptown restaurants?

59:15.485 --> 59:17.986
- Not personally, no.
- You know what they like to fix?

59:18.037 --> 59:19.571
- No.
- Sweetbreads,

59:19.606 --> 59:22.274
brains, tripe, all that shit don't
nobody like to eat.

59:22.308 --> 59:23.775
You know why that is?

59:23.777 --> 59:26.444
Because it's a challenge.
You have to innovate.

59:26.462 --> 59:28.163
You're pretty smart for a honky.

59:28.214 --> 59:29.798
That's right. It's a challenge.

59:29.832 --> 59:31.883
The stuff they fix--, dead cheap.

59:31.918 --> 59:34.303
Most folks throw it out,
give it to the cat.

59:34.337 --> 59:36.922
But poor folks--
don't throw thing out.

59:36.956 --> 59:38.290
I guess that's right.

59:38.308 --> 59:40.625
Anybody can make a Porterhouse
steak taste good.

59:40.643 --> 59:42.477
But if you can't buy
no Porterhouse steak

59:42.512 --> 59:45.130
and you still wants to eat something
that tastes good, what do you do then?

59:45.164 --> 59:46.865
- Innovate!
- Innovate, that's right...

59:46.899 --> 59:48.600
and who is it that's got to innovate?

59:48.634 --> 59:51.303
- Poor people.
- That's right, poor people.

59:51.321 --> 59:53.739
You fixing to get an A+.

59:53.773 --> 59:55.907
So how you like this?

59:55.942 --> 59:58.410
It's very good.

1:00:02.615 --> 1:00:05.701
You don't think a glass of wine
would have been good with this?

1:00:05.752 --> 1:00:07.536
I do think a glass of wine
would have been good with it.

1:00:07.587 --> 1:00:09.071
But you wouldn't drink it.

1:00:09.105 --> 1:00:11.923
Oh, I might. Just one glass.

1:00:11.958 --> 1:00:14.710
Jesus drank wine.
He and his disciples.

1:00:14.761 --> 1:00:17.296
Yes, he did. Says so
right here in the Bible.

1:00:17.298 --> 1:00:19.631
Of course it don't say nothing about
him having it in the toilet.

1:00:19.665 --> 1:00:21.600
Is that really a favorite
hiding place?

1:00:21.634 --> 1:00:23.602
Oh yeah. I've known drunks

1:00:23.636 --> 1:00:25.637
to lift the lids off toilets

1:00:25.671 --> 1:00:27.606
in strange places
just on the off chance.

1:00:27.616 --> 1:00:29.898
- Is that true?
- No, could be though.

1:00:29.900 --> 1:00:31.288
Won't surprised me none.

1:00:34.364 --> 1:00:36.531
What is the worst thing you ever did?

1:00:40.703 --> 1:00:43.021
- More jailhouse stories?
- Why not?

1:00:43.039 --> 1:00:44.823
Which why not you want to hear?

1:00:44.857 --> 1:00:46.592
Is bludgeoning the man in
the prison cafeteria

1:00:46.593 --> 1:00:48.327
the worst thing you ever did?

1:00:48.361 --> 1:00:49.878
No, it ain't.

1:00:49.912 --> 1:00:52.214
It isn't? What's the worst?

1:00:52.248 --> 1:00:54.299
- I ain't gonna tell you.
- Why not?

1:00:54.334 --> 1:00:57.135
'Cause you'll jump up,
run out the door hollering.

1:00:57.170 --> 1:00:58.703
It must be pretty bad.

1:00:58.721 --> 1:01:00.722
It is.That's why I ain't telling you.

1:01:00.757 --> 1:01:03.842
- Now, I'm afraid to ask.
- No, you ain't.

1:01:03.876 --> 1:01:05.293
Did you ever tell anyone?

1:01:05.328 --> 1:01:07.712
Yeah.

1:01:07.730 --> 1:01:09.748
It wouldn't leave me alone.

1:01:09.782 --> 1:01:11.233
Who did you tell it to?

1:01:11.267 --> 1:01:13.352
I told it to a man of God
who was my friend.

1:01:13.386 --> 1:01:15.921
- What did he say?
- He didn't say a word.

1:01:15.955 --> 1:01:18.740
But you're not curious about the
worst thing I ever did.

1:01:19.311 --> 1:01:19.933
Yeah, I am.

1:01:20.559 --> 1:01:22.661
- But you won't ask me what it is?
- I don't have to.

1:01:22.804 --> 1:01:25.851
- Why is that?
- 'Cause I was there. I've seen it.

1:01:27.094 --> 1:01:29.234
Well, I might have a different view.

1:01:29.252 --> 1:01:31.470
Yeah, you might.

1:01:32.939 --> 1:01:34.423
You want some more?

1:01:34.457 --> 1:01:36.758
No, I'm stuffed.

1:01:36.793 --> 1:01:38.176
Hungrier than you thought?

1:01:38.211 --> 1:01:39.544
Yes, I was.

1:01:39.578 --> 1:01:40.912
Good.

1:01:50.640 --> 1:01:52.607
Is this some kind of test
of your faith?

1:01:52.642 --> 1:01:55.143
- What, you?
- Me, yes.

1:01:55.194 --> 1:01:58.397
It ain't my faith you're testing.

1:01:58.431 --> 1:02:01.116
You see everything in black and white.

1:02:01.150 --> 1:02:02.868
It is black and white.

1:02:05.604 --> 1:02:07.572
You be surprised how little
time I spend

1:02:07.606 --> 1:02:08.907
trying to understand the world.

1:02:08.941 --> 1:02:11.076
You try to understand God.

1:02:11.110 --> 1:02:13.044
No, I don't.

1:02:13.079 --> 1:02:15.347
I tried to understand what
he wants from me.

1:02:15.381 --> 1:02:17.048
And that's everything you need?

1:02:17.083 --> 1:02:20.218
If God ain't everything you need,

1:02:20.253 --> 1:02:22.587
then you in a world of trouble.

1:02:22.621 --> 1:02:24.589
I don't make a move without Jesus.

1:02:24.623 --> 1:02:26.308
When I get up in the morning,

1:02:26.342 --> 1:02:28.894
I try to grab a hold to his belt.

1:02:28.928 --> 1:02:32.314
Sometime I go into a manual override.

1:02:32.348 --> 1:02:33.631
I catch myself.

1:02:33.649 --> 1:02:35.901
- Manual override?
- Yeah, you like that?

1:02:35.935 --> 1:02:38.570
- It's okay.
- I thought it was pretty good.

1:02:38.604 --> 1:02:41.156
So you come to the end of your rope

1:02:41.190 --> 1:02:43.942
and you admit defeat and
you're in despair.

1:02:43.976 --> 1:02:47.496
And in this state you seize upon this,
whatever it is,

1:02:47.530 --> 1:02:49.448
that has neither sense nor substance,

1:02:49.482 --> 1:02:53.318
and you grab hold of it
and you hang on for dear life.

1:02:53.336 --> 1:02:54.652
Is that a fair portrayal?

1:02:54.670 --> 1:02:56.171
That might be one way to say it.

1:02:56.205 --> 1:02:58.957
It doesn't make any sense.

1:02:58.991 --> 1:03:00.842
Well, I thought when we was
talking earlier

1:03:00.877 --> 1:03:03.011
you was saying that there were
none of it that made no sense--

1:03:03.045 --> 1:03:05.197
talking about the history
of the world and some such.

1:03:05.231 --> 1:03:07.349
Well, it doesn't on a larger scale.

1:03:07.383 --> 1:03:10.135
But what you're telling me
is not a view of things.

1:03:10.169 --> 1:03:12.637
It's a view of one thing
and I find it nonsensical.

1:03:12.671 --> 1:03:14.606
What would you do
if Jesus was to speak to you?

1:03:14.640 --> 1:03:16.725
Do you imagine that he might?

1:03:16.776 --> 1:03:18.343
No, I don't! But I don't know.

1:03:18.361 --> 1:03:20.312
I'm not virtuous enough.

1:03:20.346 --> 1:03:22.531
No, Professor,
it ain't nothing like that.

1:03:22.565 --> 1:03:24.282
You ain't got to be virtuous.

1:03:24.317 --> 1:03:26.234
You just has to be quiet.

1:03:26.285 --> 1:03:28.537
Now I can't speak for the lord,

1:03:28.571 --> 1:03:30.539
but it has been my experience

1:03:30.573 --> 1:03:33.875
that he will talk to
anybody who will listen.

1:03:33.910 --> 1:03:35.744
You damn sure ain't got to be virtous.

1:03:35.795 --> 1:03:37.829
If I heard God talking to me,

1:03:37.863 --> 1:03:39.998
I would be ready for you
to take me up to Bellevue,

1:03:40.032 --> 1:03:41.249
as you suggested.

1:03:41.300 --> 1:03:42.884
What if what he said made sense?

1:03:42.919 --> 1:03:45.887
Wouldn't make any difference.
Craziness is craziness.

1:03:45.902 --> 1:03:46.851
Don't make no difference
if it makes sense?

1:03:46.852 --> 1:03:47.576
No.

1:03:49.141 --> 1:03:52.394
Well, that's about as big a case
of the primacy as I ever heard.

1:03:52.428 --> 1:03:54.563
I've always gone my own way.

1:03:54.597 --> 1:03:56.681
<i>Ich kann nicht anders</i>

1:03:56.715 --> 1:03:57.849
What's that you talking?

1:03:57.883 --> 1:04:00.268
- It's German.
- You talk German?

1:04:00.319 --> 1:04:02.153
Not really. A little.
It's a quotation.

1:04:02.188 --> 1:04:04.673
Ah well, it didn't do them Germans
much good though, did it?

1:04:04.707 --> 1:04:06.658
I don't know.
The Germans contributed

1:04:06.692 --> 1:04:09.661
a great deal to civilization
before Hitler.

1:04:09.695 --> 1:04:11.830
And then they contributed Hitler.

1:04:11.864 --> 1:04:13.782
Yeah, if you like.

1:04:13.833 --> 1:04:17.369
I gather it to be your belief

1:04:17.403 --> 1:04:20.622
that culture tends to contribute
to human misery,

1:04:20.673 --> 1:04:24.676
that the more one knows,
the unhappier one is likely to be.

1:04:24.710 --> 1:04:27.345
As in the case of certain parties
known to us.

1:04:27.380 --> 1:04:29.080
In the case.

1:04:29.098 --> 1:04:30.599
Well, I don't believe I said that.

1:04:30.633 --> 1:04:32.467
I think maybe it was you who said it.

1:04:32.518 --> 1:04:34.102
- I never said it.
- Do you believe it?

1:04:34.136 --> 1:04:35.470
- No.
- No?

1:04:35.521 --> 1:04:37.188
I don't know. It could be true.

1:04:37.223 --> 1:04:39.757
Well, why is that?
That don't seem right, do it?

1:04:39.775 --> 1:04:42.193
It's the first thing in
that book there--

1:04:42.228 --> 1:04:44.062
The Garden of Eden.

1:04:44.096 --> 1:04:46.948
Knowledge is destructive to
the spirit, destructive to goodness.

1:04:46.983 --> 1:04:48.613
I thought you ain't read that book.

1:04:48.623 --> 1:04:49.723
Everybody knows that story.

1:04:49.733 --> 1:04:51.176
It's probably the most famous
story in there.

1:04:51.505 --> 1:04:52.800
Hmm, why you think that is?

1:04:52.872 --> 1:04:55.957
I suppose from the God's point
of view, all knowledge is vanity.

1:04:55.992 --> 1:04:58.610
Or maybe it just gives people

1:04:58.628 --> 1:05:01.613
the unhealthy illusion that
they can outwit the devil.

1:05:01.631 --> 1:05:04.924
Damn, Professor.
Where was you when I needed you?

1:05:05.084 --> 1:05:07.619
You'd better be careful.
You see where it's gotten me.

1:05:07.637 --> 1:05:10.955
Oh, I see. That's the topic
of discussion here.

1:05:13.643 --> 1:05:16.895
The darker picture
is always the correct one.

1:05:16.929 --> 1:05:18.763
When you read the history of the world

1:05:18.797 --> 1:05:22.300
you are reading a saga of
bloodshed and greed and folly

1:05:22.318 --> 1:05:25.136
the import of which
is impossible to ignore.

1:05:25.154 --> 1:05:28.156
And yet we imagine

1:05:28.190 --> 1:05:30.942
that the future will
somehow be different.

1:05:30.976 --> 1:05:33.144
I've no idea why we are
even still here.

1:05:33.162 --> 1:05:35.497
In all probability we won't
be here much longer.

1:05:35.531 --> 1:05:38.316
Them's some pretty
powerful words, Professor.

1:05:38.334 --> 1:05:40.251
That's what's in your
heart though, ain't it?

1:05:40.286 --> 1:05:42.837
Yes.

1:05:42.872 --> 1:05:45.123
All right, well, I can
relate to them thoughts.

1:05:45.157 --> 1:05:47.008
- You can?
- Sure I can.

1:05:47.043 --> 1:05:48.460
That surprises me.

1:05:48.494 --> 1:05:51.463
But you could be wrong, you know.

1:05:51.497 --> 1:05:52.931
I don't think so.

1:05:52.965 --> 1:05:55.183
That ain't something you have
a lot of in your life, is it?

1:05:55.217 --> 1:05:56.718
- What isn't?
- Being wrong.

1:05:56.769 --> 1:06:01.005
- I admit it when I'm wrong.
- Oh, I don't know about that.

1:06:01.023 --> 1:06:03.525
Well, you're entitled to
your own opinion.

1:06:08.748 --> 1:06:10.848
Oh yeah, here it is.

1:06:10.866 --> 1:06:12.467
Story on page 3.

1:06:12.501 --> 1:06:17.122
Ah. "Friends reported

1:06:17.156 --> 1:06:20.325
that the man had ignored all advice

1:06:20.359 --> 1:06:22.661
and stated that he intended

1:06:22.695 --> 1:06:24.996
to pursue his own course."

1:06:25.030 --> 1:06:27.666
A close confidant stated

1:06:27.700 --> 1:06:30.034
and this here is in quotations--

1:06:30.052 --> 1:06:34.806
"you couldn't tell that
son of a bitch nothing."

1:06:34.840 --> 1:06:37.258
Now can you say that in the paper--

1:06:37.309 --> 1:06:39.394
"Son of a bitch"?

1:06:44.383 --> 1:06:47.902
"Blood spattered spectators at
the 155th street station--

1:06:47.937 --> 1:06:51.606
continued on page four--"

1:06:51.657 --> 1:06:54.659
155th street station--

1:06:54.694 --> 1:06:58.563
"who were interviewed
at the scene said

1:06:58.581 --> 1:07:01.399
that the man's last words

1:07:01.417 --> 1:07:06.121
as he hurtled toward the oncoming
commuter train were,

1:07:06.407 --> 1:07:09.821
"I am right."

1:07:15.300 --> 1:07:16.019
Very funny.

1:07:18.934 --> 1:07:22.887
Oh, Professor, you an amazing man.

1:07:22.921 --> 1:07:24.856
I'm glad you find me entertaining.

1:07:24.890 --> 1:07:27.275
- Oh, I think you're pretty special.
- I don't think I'm special.

1:07:27.309 --> 1:07:29.427
- You don't?
- No, I don't.

1:07:29.445 --> 1:07:31.730
You don't think you view
those other commuters

1:07:31.764 --> 1:07:33.264
from a certain height?

1:07:33.282 --> 1:07:36.201
I view those other commuters
as fellow occupants

1:07:36.235 --> 1:07:38.436
of the same abyssal pit
in which I find myself.

1:07:38.454 --> 1:07:40.371
And if they see it
as something different,

1:07:40.406 --> 1:07:42.624
I don't know how that
makes me special.

1:07:42.658 --> 1:07:43.892
Mm.

1:07:48.764 --> 1:07:50.665
I hear what you're saying.

1:07:50.716 --> 1:07:53.668
But still I keep coming back
to these commuters,

1:07:53.719 --> 1:07:56.337
them that's waiting on the sunset.

1:07:56.388 --> 1:07:58.590
I can't help but think there's got
to be something

1:07:58.624 --> 1:08:01.125
a little special about their selves.

1:08:01.143 --> 1:08:04.462
I mean, they got to be in a deeper pit

1:08:04.480 --> 1:08:07.482
than us day travelers--
deeper and darker.

1:08:07.516 --> 1:08:09.267
I ain't saying they
down as deep as you,

1:08:09.301 --> 1:08:11.436
- but pretty deep maybe.
- So?

1:08:11.470 --> 1:08:13.822
So maybe they your brothers

1:08:13.856 --> 1:08:17.692
in self-destruction and despair.

1:08:17.743 --> 1:08:19.694
I thought misery loved company.

1:08:19.745 --> 1:08:21.996
I'm sure I don't know.

1:08:22.031 --> 1:08:25.500
Let me take a shot at it.

1:08:25.534 --> 1:08:27.502
What I think is

1:08:27.536 --> 1:08:30.088
that you got better reasons than them.

1:08:30.122 --> 1:08:33.124
See, their reasons is that they
just don't like it here,

1:08:33.158 --> 1:08:35.927
but yours says what it is not to like

1:08:35.961 --> 1:08:38.296
and why not to like it.

1:08:38.330 --> 1:08:42.050
You got more intelligent reasons,
more elegant reasons.

1:08:42.101 --> 1:08:43.935
- You making fun of me?
- No, I ain't.

1:08:43.969 --> 1:08:46.387
- But you think I'm full of shit?
- No, I don't think that.

1:08:46.438 --> 1:08:49.691
But I don't doubt what it's possible
to die from being full of shit.

1:08:49.725 --> 1:08:51.676
But I don't think that's what we're
looking at here.

1:08:51.694 --> 1:08:53.311
What do you think we're looking at?

1:08:53.345 --> 1:08:57.482
I don't know.
You got me in uncharted territory.

1:08:57.516 --> 1:09:00.368
You got these world-class reasons

1:09:00.402 --> 1:09:03.071
for taking the limited

1:09:03.122 --> 1:09:05.039
where these other dudes--
all they got is,

1:09:05.074 --> 1:09:07.075
well, maybe they just don't feel good.

1:09:07.126 --> 1:09:09.961
It might could be that you ain't even
all that unhappy.

1:09:09.995 --> 1:09:12.330
You think my education is driving
me to suicide.

1:09:12.364 --> 1:09:14.666
No, I'm just posing the question.

1:09:14.700 --> 1:09:17.001
Well, wait a minute 'fore you answer.

1:09:24.176 --> 1:09:26.845
I think that's the most ridiculous
thing I ever heard.

1:09:30.232 --> 1:09:32.734
"I think that's the most ridiculous
thing I ever heard."

1:09:32.768 --> 1:09:34.819
Very clever. What's the point?

1:09:34.854 --> 1:09:38.072
The light is all around you

1:09:38.107 --> 1:09:39.991
but you don't see nothing but shadow.

1:09:40.025 --> 1:09:41.659
And you're the one causing it.

1:09:41.694 --> 1:09:44.028
It's you. You're the shadow.

1:09:44.062 --> 1:09:45.363
That's the point.

1:09:45.397 --> 1:09:46.948
Well, I don't have your faith.

1:09:46.999 --> 1:09:48.733
Why don't we just leave it at that?

1:09:48.751 --> 1:09:50.835
You ain't never thought
about just starting over?

1:09:50.870 --> 1:09:52.837
I did at one time. I don't anymore.

1:09:52.872 --> 1:09:55.340
Well, maybe faith is just a case

1:09:55.374 --> 1:09:58.193
of not having nothing else left.

1:09:58.227 --> 1:10:02.914
Well, I do have something else.

1:10:02.932 --> 1:10:05.884
Well, why don't you just
keep that in reserve?

1:10:05.918 --> 1:10:09.520
Just take a shot at starting over.

1:10:09.555 --> 1:10:12.140
I don't mean starting again.
Everybody's done that.

1:10:12.191 --> 1:10:15.476
Over means over, just walk away.

1:10:15.527 --> 1:10:19.530
I mean everything you are

1:10:19.565 --> 1:10:22.483
and everything you have
and everything you done

1:10:22.534 --> 1:10:25.403
has brought you at last
to the bottom of a whisky bottle

1:10:25.437 --> 1:10:28.456
or bought you a one-way ticket
on the Sunset Limited,

1:10:28.490 --> 1:10:32.493
you can't give me one good reason
on God's green earth

1:10:32.544 --> 1:10:36.481
for salvaging none of it,
'cause there ain't none.

1:10:36.515 --> 1:10:38.466
If you can bring yourself

1:10:38.500 --> 1:10:42.119
to close the door on all of that,

1:10:42.137 --> 1:10:45.623
it will be cold and it will be lonely

1:10:45.641 --> 1:10:49.627
and there will be
a fierce wind blowing.

1:10:49.645 --> 1:10:52.764
But you don't say nothing.

1:10:52.798 --> 1:10:56.133
You just turn your collar up

1:10:56.151 --> 1:10:57.769
and keep walking.

1:10:57.803 --> 1:11:01.406
I can't. I can't.

1:11:06.019 --> 1:11:07.870
- You want some more coffee?
- No, thank you.

1:11:12.668 --> 1:11:15.169
Why do you think it is
folks take their own life?

1:11:15.204 --> 1:11:17.338
I don't know. Different reasons.

1:11:17.340 --> 1:11:19.757
Is there anything these different
reasons has got in common?

1:11:19.792 --> 1:11:21.759
I can't speak for others.

1:11:21.794 --> 1:11:23.761
My own reasons center around

1:11:23.796 --> 1:11:25.763
a gradual loss of make-believe,

1:11:25.798 --> 1:11:28.349
a gradual enlightenment
as to the nature

1:11:28.384 --> 1:11:31.352
of reality, of the world.

1:11:31.387 --> 1:11:33.838
- Them worldly reasons.
- If you like.

1:11:33.872 --> 1:11:36.841
- Them elegant reasons.
- That was your description.

1:11:36.859 --> 1:11:38.676
You ain't disagreed with it.

1:11:38.711 --> 1:11:42.296
It's them reasons that your brother
don't know nothing about

1:11:42.298 --> 1:11:45.984
hanging from his necktie from
a steampipe down in the basement.

1:11:46.018 --> 1:11:48.352
He's got his own dumbass reasons

1:11:48.370 --> 1:11:51.489
but if we could find a way
to educate him

1:11:51.523 --> 1:11:53.491
to them more elegant reasons

1:11:53.525 --> 1:11:56.294
and make them available
to him and his buddies,

1:11:56.328 --> 1:11:58.246
then there'd be a lot
of folk out there

1:11:58.297 --> 1:12:01.466
could off themselves with more
joy in their hearts. What you think?

1:12:01.500 --> 1:12:03.751
Now I know you' being facetious.

1:12:03.802 --> 1:12:08.923
I think you're right. I think you
done finally drove me to it.

1:12:08.957 --> 1:12:12.677
Professor done gone
to laying mm-hmms on me.

1:12:12.711 --> 1:12:14.045
I guess I'd better watch my step.

1:12:14.079 --> 1:12:15.847
You better had.
I might be warming up the trick bag.

1:12:15.881 --> 1:12:19.400
You think your reasons
is about the world,

1:12:19.435 --> 1:12:21.486
and his is mostly about him.

1:12:21.520 --> 1:12:23.771
I think that's probably true.

1:12:23.822 --> 1:12:27.224
I think I see a different truth
sitting across the table from me.

1:12:27.242 --> 1:12:28.760
Which is?

1:12:28.794 --> 1:12:31.446
That you must
love your brother or die.

1:12:31.497 --> 1:12:33.164
I don't know what that means.

1:12:33.198 --> 1:12:36.000
It's another world
from anything I know.

1:12:36.035 --> 1:12:38.786
Well, well, tell me how your world is.

1:12:38.837 --> 1:12:40.121
You don't want to hear it.

1:12:40.172 --> 1:12:42.173
- Sure I do.
- I don't think so.

1:12:45.344 --> 1:12:47.261
All right., go ahead.

1:12:47.296 --> 1:12:50.181
It's that the world is basically
a forced labor camp

1:12:50.215 --> 1:12:52.416
from which the workers,
perfectly innocent,

1:12:52.434 --> 1:12:54.769
are led forth by lottery,
a few each day,

1:12:54.803 --> 1:12:56.754
to be executed.

1:12:56.772 --> 1:12:59.123
I don't think that's
just the way I see it.

1:12:59.158 --> 1:13:01.109
I think that's the way it is.

1:13:01.143 --> 1:13:03.728
Are there alternative views? Yes.

1:13:03.762 --> 1:13:06.263
Will any of them stand close scrutiny?

1:13:06.281 --> 1:13:07.899
No.

1:13:08.817 --> 1:13:11.452
So do you want to take a look

1:13:11.487 --> 1:13:14.238
at that train schedule again?

1:13:21.830 --> 1:13:24.749
If this ain't the life you wanted,
what was?

1:13:24.783 --> 1:13:27.218
I don't know. Not this.

1:13:27.252 --> 1:13:30.288
Are you living the life
you had planned?

1:13:30.322 --> 1:13:31.722
No, it ain't.

1:13:31.757 --> 1:13:34.125
But I got what I needed
instead of what I wanted.

1:13:34.143 --> 1:13:36.160
Sometimes that's the best
kind of luck to have.

1:13:36.195 --> 1:13:38.096
Yeah, well..

1:13:38.130 --> 1:13:42.733
You can't compare your life to mine
though, can you?

1:13:42.768 --> 1:13:46.337
No, I can't.

1:13:46.371 --> 1:13:48.106
I just can't.

1:13:48.140 --> 1:13:52.076
Oh, I'm sorry. I should go.

1:13:52.111 --> 1:13:54.829
- You don't have to go.
- I've offended you.

1:13:54.863 --> 1:13:56.480
Look, my hide is thicker than that.

1:13:56.498 --> 1:13:58.366
Don't go. You ain't hurt my feelings.

1:13:58.417 --> 1:14:00.655
I know you think I should be thankful,
I'm sorry not to be.

1:14:00.848 --> 1:14:02.630
- No, there ain't no such thing.
- I should go--

1:14:02.704 --> 1:14:04.071
I'm digging a dry hole, ain't I?

1:14:04.106 --> 1:14:05.623
I admire your persistence.

1:14:05.657 --> 1:14:08.292
What can I do to get you
to just stay, just a bit?

1:14:08.326 --> 1:14:11.345
Why? Are you hoping that if I stay
long enough God might talk to me?

1:14:11.380 --> 1:14:13.548
No, I'm hoping he'll speak to me.

1:14:13.599 --> 1:14:17.218
I know you think I at least owe you
a little more of my time.

1:14:17.220 --> 1:14:19.053
I know I'm ungrateful.

1:14:19.055 --> 1:14:21.572
But ingratitude is not the same

1:14:21.607 --> 1:14:25.143
to a spiritual bankrupt,
that it is to a man of God.

1:14:25.177 --> 1:14:26.811
I don't think you owe me
nothing, Professor.

1:14:26.845 --> 1:14:28.345
- You really think that?
- Yeah, I do.

1:14:28.363 --> 1:14:30.781
Well, you're very kind. And I wish
there was something I could do

1:14:30.816 --> 1:14:32.483
to repay you, but there isn't.

1:14:32.517 --> 1:14:35.019
So why don't we just say goodbye?
You can get on with your life.

1:14:35.037 --> 1:14:37.521
Suppose--

1:14:37.555 --> 1:14:39.574
Suppose I've to tell you,
you could wake up tomorrow

1:14:39.625 --> 1:14:41.659
and you wouldn't want to be jumping
in front of no train.

1:14:41.693 --> 1:14:43.511
Suppose all you had to do was ask.
Would you do it?

1:14:43.545 --> 1:14:46.047
That just depends on what I would
have to give up.

1:14:46.081 --> 1:14:48.166
See, I started to write that down
on a piece of paper.

1:14:48.200 --> 1:14:49.634
What is it you think I'm
holding on to?

1:14:49.668 --> 1:14:51.002
I don't know!

1:14:51.036 --> 1:14:53.804
What is it, the terminal commuter
cherishes

1:14:53.806 --> 1:14:55.890
- that he would die for?
- I don't know.

1:14:55.924 --> 1:14:58.795
No, no.

1:14:59.478 --> 1:15:01.345
You don't.

1:15:01.347 --> 1:15:03.214
You don't want to talk
to me no more, do you?

1:15:03.232 --> 1:15:05.233
I thought you had a thick skin.

1:15:05.267 --> 1:15:08.186
It is, but it ain't hide to the bone.

1:15:08.220 --> 1:15:12.356
Why do you think there is something
that I won't give up?

1:15:21.233 --> 1:15:26.478
I think, any man anxious to get
run over by a train

1:15:26.505 --> 1:15:28.572
has got to have
something on his mind.

1:15:28.590 --> 1:15:30.424
I mean most of us would just settle

1:15:30.459 --> 1:15:32.576
for maybe a slap upside the head.

1:15:32.594 --> 1:15:34.929
You say you don't care about nothing,

1:15:34.963 --> 1:15:36.847
but I don't believe that.

1:15:36.882 --> 1:15:39.600
I don't think death
is ever about nothing.

1:15:39.635 --> 1:15:43.087
You asked me what I think
you're holding on to

1:15:43.105 --> 1:15:45.723
and I got to say I don't know.

1:15:45.757 --> 1:15:48.259
Or maybe I just don't have
the words to say it.

1:15:48.277 --> 1:15:49.944
And maybe you know

1:15:49.978 --> 1:15:52.196
but you just ain't telling.

1:15:52.231 --> 1:15:54.148
What I believe is

1:15:54.199 --> 1:15:56.317
that when you took
your celebrated leap,

1:15:56.368 --> 1:15:58.069
you was taking it with you

1:15:58.103 --> 1:16:00.071
and you was holding on to it,

1:16:00.105 --> 1:16:03.457
holding on for grim death.

1:16:04.793 --> 1:16:07.578
I'm just looking for
the words, Professor.

1:16:07.612 --> 1:16:10.214
I'm looking for the words
'cause I know the words

1:16:10.249 --> 1:16:12.917
is just the way to your heart.

1:16:12.951 --> 1:16:15.086
Well, I can't help you.

1:16:15.120 --> 1:16:16.721
Letting it all go

1:16:16.755 --> 1:16:18.472
is the place I finally got to.

1:16:18.507 --> 1:16:20.808
It took a lot of work to get there.
And if there's one thing

1:16:20.842 --> 1:16:23.261
I would be unwilling to give up,
it is exactly that.

1:16:23.295 --> 1:16:25.462
Is there another way you can say that?

1:16:25.480 --> 1:16:28.516
The one thing I won't give up
is giving up.

1:16:28.567 --> 1:16:30.484
I expect that to carry me through.

1:16:30.519 --> 1:16:32.653
I'm depending on it.

1:16:32.688 --> 1:16:34.655
The things I believe in

1:16:34.690 --> 1:16:36.691
were very frail, as I've said.

1:16:36.742 --> 1:16:38.909
They won't be around very long
and neither will I.

1:16:38.944 --> 1:16:41.996
But I don't think that's really
the reason for my decision.

1:16:42.030 --> 1:16:44.498
I think it goes deeper than that.

1:16:44.533 --> 1:16:46.917
You can acclimate yourself to loss.

1:16:46.952 --> 1:16:49.870
You have to. I mean...

1:16:49.921 --> 1:16:51.488
You like music, right?

1:16:51.506 --> 1:16:53.524
Yeah, yeah, I do.

1:16:53.558 --> 1:16:56.660
Who is the greatest composer
that you know of?

1:16:56.678 --> 1:16:58.662
John Coltrane, hands down.

1:16:58.680 --> 1:17:00.381
Do you think his work
will last forever?

1:17:00.415 --> 1:17:02.499
Well,

1:17:02.517 --> 1:17:04.685
forever's a long time, Professor.

1:17:04.720 --> 1:17:06.520
So I got to say no.

1:17:06.555 --> 1:17:08.773
That doesn't mean
it's worthless, does it?

1:17:08.807 --> 1:17:10.941
No, it don't.

1:17:10.976 --> 1:17:14.278
You give up the world line by line.

1:17:14.313 --> 1:17:17.365
You become an accomplice
to your own annihilation.

1:17:17.399 --> 1:17:18.899
There's nothing you can do about it.

1:17:18.934 --> 1:17:22.753
Everything you do closes a door
somewhere ahead of you.

1:17:22.788 --> 1:17:26.190
Finally there's only one door left.

1:17:26.208 --> 1:17:28.409
That's a dark world, Professor.

1:17:28.460 --> 1:17:32.580
Maybe you just need to admit
that you're in over your head.

1:17:32.631 --> 1:17:35.249
I do admit it, but that don't let
me off the hook.

1:17:35.300 --> 1:17:38.369
I got no choice.

1:17:38.387 --> 1:17:39.887
Okay.

1:17:39.921 --> 1:17:42.873
Maybe you're right.

1:17:42.891 --> 1:17:47.378
Well, here is my news, Reverend.

1:17:47.396 --> 1:17:49.713
I long for the darkness.

1:17:49.731 --> 1:17:52.149
I pray for death, real death.

1:17:52.184 --> 1:17:54.902
And if I thought that in death I would
meet the people I knew in life,

1:17:54.936 --> 1:17:57.554
I don't know what I would do,
that would be the ultimate horror,

1:17:57.572 --> 1:17:59.523
the ultimate nightmare.
If I thought I was gonna

1:17:59.557 --> 1:18:01.776
meet my mother again
and start at all over,

1:18:01.827 --> 1:18:05.663
only this time without the prospect
of death to look forward to,

1:18:05.697 --> 1:18:08.366
that would be the final nightmare,

1:18:08.400 --> 1:18:10.401
Kafka on wheels.

1:18:10.435 --> 1:18:12.903
Man, Ppressor. You don't want see
your own mama?

1:18:12.938 --> 1:18:14.622
No, I don't.

1:18:14.673 --> 1:18:18.075
I want the dead to be dead

1:18:18.093 --> 1:18:20.044
forever.

1:18:20.078 --> 1:18:22.079
I don't want to be one of them,

1:18:22.097 --> 1:18:23.300
Except of course you can't
be one of them.

1:18:23.301 --> 1:18:24.309
You can't be one of the dead

1:18:24.310 --> 1:18:27.885
because that which, has no existence
can have no community.

1:18:27.919 --> 1:18:30.688
No community.

1:18:30.722 --> 1:18:32.756
My heart warms
just thinking about it--

1:18:32.774 --> 1:18:35.276
blackness, aloneness,

1:18:35.310 --> 1:18:39.113
silence, peace,

1:18:39.147 --> 1:18:42.049
and all of it only a heartbeat away.

1:18:45.270 --> 1:18:48.939
I don't regard my state of mind

1:18:48.957 --> 1:18:51.575
as some pessimistic view of the world.

1:18:51.609 --> 1:18:54.211
I regarded it as the world itself.

1:18:54.246 --> 1:18:57.114
Evolution cannot avoid

1:18:57.149 --> 1:18:59.166
bringing intelligent life

1:18:59.168 --> 1:19:02.505
ultimaly, to an awareness of 1 thing,
and one thing above all else

1:19:02.787 --> 1:19:06.457
and that one thing is futility.

1:19:06.475 --> 1:19:09.727
If I'm understanding you
right, you're saying

1:19:09.761 --> 1:19:12.980
everybody that ain't eat up with
the dumbass

1:19:13.014 --> 1:19:14.632
ought to be suicidal.

1:19:14.666 --> 1:19:16.800
- Yes.
- You ain't shitting me?

1:19:16.818 --> 1:19:20.070
No, I am not shitting you.

1:19:20.105 --> 1:19:23.357
If people could see the world
for what it truly is,

1:19:23.408 --> 1:19:25.976
see their lives for what
they truly are,

1:19:25.994 --> 1:19:28.729
without dreams or illusions,

1:19:28.764 --> 1:19:31.358
I don't believe they could offer the
first reason why they should not be

1:19:31.359 --> 1:19:33.951
let to die as soon as possible

1:19:33.985 --> 1:19:36.820
I don't believe in God.
Can you understand that?

1:19:36.822 --> 1:19:41.719
Look around you, man. Can't you see?
The clever and dare to those torment

1:19:41.843 --> 1:19:44.595
has to be the sound most
pleasing to his ears.

1:19:44.629 --> 1:19:46.797
And I loathe these discussions--

1:19:46.831 --> 1:19:49.300
the argument of the village atheist

1:19:49.334 --> 1:19:52.770
whose single passion
is to revile endlessly

1:19:52.804 --> 1:19:56.390
that which he denies the existence
of in the first place.

1:19:56.441 --> 1:19:58.192
Your fellowship

1:19:58.226 --> 1:20:00.511
is a fellowship of pain and
nothing more.

1:20:00.529 --> 1:20:02.363
And if that pain were collective

1:20:02.397 --> 1:20:04.064
instead of merely reiterative,

1:20:04.115 --> 1:20:06.317
the sheer weight of it would
drag the world

1:20:06.351 --> 1:20:08.202
from the walls of the universe

1:20:08.236 --> 1:20:10.871
andd send it crashing and burning down

1:20:10.906 --> 1:20:14.458
through whatever night it might
yet be capable of engendering

1:20:14.493 --> 1:20:17.328
until it was not even ash.

1:20:17.362 --> 1:20:20.364
And brotherhood,

1:20:20.382 --> 1:20:24.418
justice, eternal life?

1:20:24.469 --> 1:20:26.637
Good God, man.

1:20:26.671 --> 1:20:29.223
Show me a religion that prepares one

1:20:29.257 --> 1:20:31.141
for nothingness, for death.

1:20:31.176 --> 1:20:32.810
That's a church I want to enter.

1:20:32.844 --> 1:20:36.764
Yours prepares one only for more life,

1:20:36.815 --> 1:20:40.401
for dreams and illusions and lies.

1:20:41.278 --> 1:20:46.574
There is a fear of death from man
mostly who wouldn't live a day.--

1:20:46.608 --> 1:20:49.026
who would want this nightmare

1:20:49.060 --> 1:20:52.329
but for fear of the next.

1:20:52.364 --> 1:20:54.898
The shadow of the axe

1:20:54.916 --> 1:20:58.035
hangs over every joy.

1:20:58.069 --> 1:21:01.071
Every road ends in death,

1:21:01.089 --> 1:21:03.958
every friendship, every love.

1:21:04.009 --> 1:21:08.596
Torment, lost, betrayal,

1:21:08.630 --> 1:21:12.850
pain, suffering,

1:21:12.884 --> 1:21:15.519
age,

1:21:15.554 --> 1:21:17.938
indignity,

1:21:17.973 --> 1:21:23.143
hideous lingering illness--

1:21:23.194 --> 1:21:27.898
and all of it with a single conclusion

1:21:27.932 --> 1:21:29.867
for you

1:21:29.901 --> 1:21:31.935
and every one and every thing

1:21:31.953 --> 1:21:35.239
you have ever chosen to care for.

1:21:35.273 --> 1:21:37.541
That is the true brotherhood,
the true fellowship.

1:21:37.576 --> 1:21:39.660
And everybody is a member for life.

1:21:41.092 --> 1:21:44.130
You tell me that my brother
is my salvation?

1:21:44.140 --> 1:21:47.524
My salvation, well then... damn hell.

1:21:47.920 --> 1:21:51.338
Damn him in every shape
and guise and form.

1:21:51.389 --> 1:21:53.457
Do I see myself in him? Yes, I do.

1:21:53.475 --> 1:21:57.061
And what I see sickens me.

1:21:57.095 --> 1:22:00.314
Do you understand me?

1:22:00.348 --> 1:22:02.733
Can you understand me?

1:22:11.643 --> 1:22:13.410
I'm sorry.

1:22:15.363 --> 1:22:16.997
How long you felt like this?

1:22:17.032 --> 1:22:19.149
All my life.

1:22:19.167 --> 1:22:21.285
- Is that true?
- It's worse than that.

1:22:21.319 --> 1:22:23.537
I don't see what could be
worse than that.

1:22:23.539 --> 1:22:27.458
Rage is really only for the good days.

1:22:27.492 --> 1:22:29.510
The truth is there's
little of that left.

1:22:29.544 --> 1:22:33.097
The truth is that the forms I see

1:22:33.131 --> 1:22:35.683
have been slowly emptied out.

1:22:35.717 --> 1:22:37.668
They no longer have any content.

1:22:37.686 --> 1:22:40.771
They're shapes only-- a train, a wall,

1:22:40.805 --> 1:22:43.557
a world, a man--

1:22:43.559 --> 1:22:46.060
a thing dangling

1:22:46.111 --> 1:22:49.113
in senseless articulation
in a howling void,--

1:22:49.115 --> 1:22:51.315
no meaning to it's life,

1:22:51.349 --> 1:22:54.034
its words.

1:22:56.705 --> 1:23:00.708
Why would I seek out
the company of such a thing?

1:23:00.742 --> 1:23:02.109
Why?

1:23:03.628 --> 1:23:05.963
Damn.

1:23:05.997 --> 1:23:08.865
So you see what it is you've saved?

1:23:08.883 --> 1:23:11.335
Tried to save.
Still trying... trying hard.

1:23:11.369 --> 1:23:14.471
- Who is your brother?
- Who is my brother, yes.

1:23:14.506 --> 1:23:16.423
Is that the reason I'm here
in your apartment?

1:23:16.474 --> 1:23:19.343
No, that's why I'm here.

1:23:19.377 --> 1:23:22.179
You asked me what I'm a Professor of.

1:23:22.213 --> 1:23:24.548
I am a Professor of darkness,

1:23:24.566 --> 1:23:27.434
the night and in day's clothing.

1:23:27.485 --> 1:23:30.521
And now I wish you all the very best,

1:23:30.555 --> 1:23:32.656
but I must go.

1:23:32.691 --> 1:23:34.525
Just stay a little while longer.

1:23:34.559 --> 1:23:36.910
No, no more time. Goodbye.

1:23:38.630 --> 1:23:40.731
We cank about something else, I swear.

1:23:40.733 --> 1:23:42.616
I don't want to talk about
something else.

1:23:42.667 --> 1:23:44.752
Don't go out there, Professor!
You know what's out there!

1:23:47.739 --> 1:23:50.674
I know what's out there
and I know who is out there.

1:23:50.709 --> 1:23:52.676
I rush to nuzzle his bony cheek.

1:23:52.711 --> 1:23:55.929
No doubt he will be surprised
to find himself so cherished.

1:23:55.964 --> 1:23:57.598
And as I cling to his neck

1:23:57.632 --> 1:23:59.750
I will whisper in that
dry and ancient ear,

1:23:59.768 --> 1:24:01.633
"Here I am. Here I am."

1:24:01.634 --> 1:24:03.885
- Now open the door!
- Don't do this.

1:24:04.202 --> 1:24:06.772
You're a kind man.
I've heard you out

1:24:06.791 --> 1:24:08.085
and you've heard me.
There's no more to say.

1:24:08.810 --> 1:24:12.229
Your God must once have stood

1:24:12.263 --> 1:24:14.364
at a dawn of infinite possibilities,

1:24:14.399 --> 1:24:17.117
and that is what he's made of it.

1:24:17.152 --> 1:24:20.237
You tell me that I want God's love.
I don't.

1:24:20.271 --> 1:24:23.407
Perhaps I want forgiveness,
but there is no one to ask it of.

1:24:23.441 --> 1:24:26.210
And there's no going back.
There's no setting things right.

1:24:26.244 --> 1:24:28.612
There's only the hope of nothingness.

1:24:28.630 --> 1:24:30.831
And I cling to that hope.

1:24:30.882 --> 1:24:33.116
- Now open the door.
- Don't do this.

1:24:33.134 --> 1:24:35.736
Please open the door.

1:25:13.958 --> 1:25:16.326
Thank you, goodbye.

1:25:21.099 --> 1:25:23.217
Professor,

1:25:23.268 --> 1:25:27.855
I know you ain't mean them words.

1:25:27.889 --> 1:25:30.274
I'm gonna be there in the morning.

1:25:31.726 --> 1:25:33.710
I'm gonna be there, you hear?

1:25:35.547 --> 1:25:37.681
I'm gonna be there!

1:25:40.118 --> 1:25:47.424
I'm gonna be there.

1:25:47.426 --> 1:25:50.277
You know he ain't mean them words.

1:25:52.997 --> 1:26:00.337
You know he didn't.

1:26:00.371 --> 1:26:04.141
I don't understand why you sent
me down there.

1:26:04.175 --> 1:26:06.059
I don't understand.

1:26:06.094 --> 1:26:09.563
If you wanted me to help him, then how
come you didn't give me the words?

1:26:09.597 --> 1:26:12.849
You give them to him. What about me?

1:26:21.442 --> 1:26:25.445
That's all right. That's all right.

1:26:25.496 --> 1:26:28.498
If you don't never speak again,

1:26:28.533 --> 1:26:32.402
you know I'll keep your word.

1:26:32.420 --> 1:26:36.239
You know I will.
You know I'm good for it.

1:26:39.661 --> 1:26:42.012
Is that okay?

1:26:48.052 --> 1:26:50.187
Is that okay?

1:26:52.052 --> 1:26:58.187
