 Liv: <i> Previously on</i> izombie...

00:02.336 --> 00:03.769
            (growls)

00:03.771 --> 00:05.204
   <i> I was at the</i>
   <i> lake washington massacre.</i>

00:05.206 --> 00:07.239
     <i> People were tearing</i>
     <i> each other to pieces.</i>

00:07.241 --> 00:09.942
       This menu is
       homeless teenagers
       who blaine kills

00:09.943 --> 00:11.910
   In cold blood for profit!

00:11.912 --> 00:13.946
           -(gunshot)
           -(screams)

00:13.948 --> 00:16.382
    -You're going to get me
    the brain of alan york.
        -The astronaut?

00:16.384 --> 00:18.083
      Johnny: <i> I'm a</i>
     <i> beloved public figure.</i>

00:18.085 --> 00:20.019
     <i> Isn't there something</i>
     <i> we could do to just</i>
     <i> make this go away?</i>

00:20.021 --> 00:22.287
      Major: <i> That candyman</i>
      <i> guy came at me</i>
      <i> with a sledgehammer.</i>

00:22.289 --> 00:24.256
     -(glass shattering)
     -when i shot the guy,

00:24.258 --> 00:25.557
  <i> His eyes turned bright red!</i>

00:25.559 --> 00:27.359
  What you're saying happened
  didn't happen.

00:27.361 --> 00:29.328
   And if you believe it did,
   you got a problem.

00:29.330 --> 00:32.064
  You're not checking yourself
  in to a mental hospital,
  you're not crazy.

00:32.066 --> 00:33.298
       Liv: <i> For a few weeks</i>
      <i> he's safe.</i>

00:33.300 --> 00:34.600
      I've seen guys like
      your candyman.

00:34.602 --> 00:36.402
    I still have nightmares
    about those eyes.
    They're red.

00:36.404 --> 00:37.836
    -You know what they are?
    -What are they?

00:37.838 --> 00:39.338
       Friggin' zombies.

00:53.254 --> 00:55.354
     Orderly: Yo, numbnuts!

00:55.356 --> 00:58.791
      What is your
      malfunction, major?

00:58.793 --> 01:02.261
   Good one.
   Just waiting for scott e.

01:02.263 --> 01:03.962
      Maybe he's tired
      of kicking your ass.

01:05.465 --> 01:08.067
 (in a russian accent) comrade!
 Time to play chess, <i> da?</i>

01:09.737 --> 01:11.003
         Come on, dude!

01:11.005 --> 01:13.439
    They got the
    new safety scissors in.

01:15.376 --> 01:17.309
  I could be making
  a serenity collage for my...

01:18.712 --> 01:21.547
   Scott! Hey!
   I need some help in here!

01:22.516 --> 01:24.817
          Hey, scott.

01:24.819 --> 01:27.052
          Help! Scott!

01:27.054 --> 01:29.121
      (theme song playing)

01:53.948 --> 01:57.449
  Victim's name was
  scott eberhard, aka scott e.

01:57.451 --> 01:59.551
    Twenty-four.
    Small-time drug dealer.

01:59.553 --> 02:01.854
       He checked in
       seven months ago.

02:01.856 --> 02:03.555
 And he used this to check out.

02:05.626 --> 02:08.060
      I've seen shivs
      like this in prison.

02:08.062 --> 02:11.062
 But people in prison generally
 don't use 'em on themselves.

02:11.065 --> 02:13.132
      Scott e didn't
      do this to himself.

02:13.134 --> 02:15.868
  See, if his heart had still
  been beating when
  his wrists were slit,

02:15.870 --> 02:17.669
        That tub would
        be a deeper red.

02:17.671 --> 02:20.506
   The rose tint suggests
   he was dead or nearly dead

02:20.508 --> 02:22.374
  Before his wrists were slit.

02:22.376 --> 02:24.076
      Making this murder.

02:24.078 --> 02:26.178
    Who discovered the body?

02:26.981 --> 02:28.113
         Hey, stranger.

02:29.917 --> 02:32.050
      Aren't you a
      sight for sore eyes.

02:32.052 --> 02:33.519
           Detective.

02:33.521 --> 02:36.088
    Why don't you start
    by telling us what time
    you found the victim?

02:36.090 --> 02:39.091
  It was before morning group.
  So, maybe 9:30?

02:39.093 --> 02:42.427
 He was late for our chess game
 so i left the day room
 and went looking for him.

02:42.429 --> 02:44.363
 See anyone else near his room?

02:44.365 --> 02:46.865
      Just brie,
      another client here.

02:46.867 --> 02:49.234
    What's her relationship,
    if any, to the victim?

02:49.236 --> 02:50.669
     Friends with benefits.

02:50.671 --> 02:53.038
    I believe that's what
    the kids are calling it.

02:53.040 --> 02:54.640
       So potentially
       a lover's quarrel?

02:54.642 --> 02:57.943
     "lover" would be
     overstating the nature
     of the relationship.

02:57.945 --> 02:59.912
   Brie has lots of friends.

03:01.282 --> 03:03.415
     We talked to
     one of the orderlies.

03:03.417 --> 03:06.785
    He said you'd get pretty
    frustrated by scott e
    beating you at chess.

03:06.787 --> 03:09.054
    Yeah, so i murdered him.

03:09.056 --> 03:11.557
       You're right, liv,
       this guy is good.

03:11.559 --> 03:14.960
    It's a mental hospital.
    Everyone's a suspect.

03:14.962 --> 03:18.497
    Scott e and i,
    we played chess and
    were in the same group.

03:18.499 --> 03:21.099
   That was our relationship.

03:21.101 --> 03:23.335
  You know who
  might've had it in for him?

03:23.337 --> 03:25.604
       -Uh... The devil?
       -The devil.

03:25.606 --> 03:27.940
 He'd tell anyone who listened
 the devil was after him.

03:27.942 --> 03:29.708
    You'd see him talking to
    himself, pissed off,

03:29.710 --> 03:31.210
     But he'd insist he was
     talking to the devil.

03:31.212 --> 03:33.512
 So, i should call in the apb.

03:33.514 --> 03:36.181
 Horns. Pointy tail. Pitchfork?

03:36.183 --> 03:37.816
 Anything else you can tell us?

03:37.818 --> 03:40.452
    Scott e was one
    of my favorite patients.

03:40.454 --> 03:43.088
       Funny. Iq of 145.

03:43.090 --> 03:44.923
       No family history
       of mental illness,

03:44.925 --> 03:47.426
    Although there was some
    emotional abuse at home.

03:47.428 --> 03:49.561
 We heard he was having
 conversations with the devil.

03:49.563 --> 03:51.096
     Persecutory delusions,

03:51.098 --> 03:53.599
   Symptomatic of a psychotic
   disorder like scott's.

03:53.601 --> 03:56.435
    No family history
    of mental illness,
    what landed him in here?

03:56.437 --> 03:59.438
 His psychotic break was
 triggered by a
 particularly traumatic event.

03:59.440 --> 04:03.542
   You remember the massacre
   that happened out
   on lake washington?

04:03.544 --> 04:05.377
      Did he know someone
      who died out there?

04:05.379 --> 04:07.079
 Several people. He was there.

04:07.081 --> 04:08.947
 He witnessed the entire thing.

04:08.949 --> 04:11.416
     I can imagine how
     an event like that
     could change a person.

04:11.418 --> 04:13.819
    Who would you say he was
    closest to in here,
    dr. Larson?

04:13.821 --> 04:15.821
  Oh, he was a bit of a loner.

04:15.823 --> 04:19.391
 But recently, he had become
 quite close to one of the new
 patients, major lilywhite.

04:19.392 --> 04:21.392
       Those two were
       thick as thieves.

04:24.231 --> 04:25.864
            Careful.

04:25.866 --> 04:29.868
    Don't open yourself up
    to the classic reversed
       sicilian gambit.

04:29.870 --> 04:31.970
  That's a chess thing, right?

04:31.972 --> 04:34.339
   Sounds more like something
   a call girl would make
   you pay extra for.

04:35.342 --> 04:37.142
       Listen... (sighs)

04:37.144 --> 04:40.579
  I apologize for clive going
  all joe friday back there...

04:40.581 --> 04:42.547
      Scott e did tell me
      something else.

04:43.651 --> 04:45.951
    But it's just... (sighs)

04:46.620 --> 04:48.086
         It's so crazy.

04:48.555 --> 04:49.988
         (sighs deeply)

04:49.990 --> 04:51.356
             Liv...

04:51.358 --> 04:54.926
  Did you see anything strange
  at the boat party?

04:54.928 --> 04:56.895
            (scoffs)

04:56.897 --> 04:59.998
       You mean, besides
       all the bloodshed

05:00.000 --> 05:02.100
 And the fire and the corpses?

05:03.704 --> 05:05.370
           He said...

05:07.908 --> 05:11.043
    He said he saw zombies.

05:16.717 --> 05:19.151
  (chuckles) zombies? Like...

05:20.254 --> 05:22.287
  Real, flesh-eating zombies?

05:22.289 --> 05:24.189
       Look, i... I know.

05:24.191 --> 05:27.259
   But he said he didn't just
   see these zombies.

05:27.261 --> 05:30.095
     He got them on video.
     On his phone.

05:31.298 --> 05:32.898
    -Did he show it to you?
    -No.

05:32.900 --> 05:36.268
    But he, uh... He said
    he sent it to a friend.
    Someone in local tv.

05:37.504 --> 05:41.073
       Like i said,
       it's crazy, right?

05:51.485 --> 05:53.752
  I told myself that at least
  major would be safe

05:53.754 --> 05:57.756
  If he stopped hunting down
   the candyman and checked
  himself into that hospital.

05:57.758 --> 06:01.226
  Turns out it's a great place
  to get yourself murdered and
      learn about zombies.

06:01.228 --> 06:04.062
    You know, removing the
    porcelain from that dish
    isn't gonna help, liv.

06:04.064 --> 06:06.898
   The good news for scott e,
   such as it is,

06:06.900 --> 06:11.203
  The toxicology report shows
  that he went gently to that
     warm bath in the sky

06:11.205 --> 06:13.438
       From an overdose
       of amitriptyline.

06:13.440 --> 06:15.540
    So a doctor? Or a nurse?

06:15.542 --> 06:19.244
 Well, patients are notorious
 for not swallowing their meds,
 saving them up.

06:19.246 --> 06:22.347
 So anyone in blooming grove
 could've gotten their hands on
 enough amitriptyline

06:22.349 --> 06:26.151
 To put scott e under,
 then slit his wrists and make
 it look like a suicide.

06:26.153 --> 06:28.520
    They just got the dosage
    a bit too high.

06:28.522 --> 06:31.690
  Now, you might want to have
  some serious pharmaceuticals
  on hand yourself

06:31.692 --> 06:33.425
       For when scott e's
       brains kick in.

06:33.427 --> 06:35.627
     No drugs.
     I need to stay sharp.

06:35.629 --> 06:37.729
     I've got to find that
     zombie video.

06:37.731 --> 06:41.032
   See, i'm worried about what
   effect this brain's gonna
   have on you.

06:41.034 --> 06:43.635
 Agreed, it would be less than
 ideal if that video got out,

06:43.637 --> 06:45.871
   -But...
   -It would be catastrophic.

06:45.873 --> 06:49.307
 While we're on the subject of
 huge problems we'd like to
 nip in the bud,

06:49.309 --> 06:50.742
 Where do we stand with blaine?

06:50.744 --> 06:53.812
    Well, i need to find him
    before i can rid
    the world of him.

06:53.814 --> 06:56.548
  Which won't be easy without
  a last name or address.

06:56.550 --> 06:59.217
     Well, in the meantime,
     i don't want you to do
         anything crazy,

06:59.219 --> 07:01.353
    Like think you can fly
    and jump off a building

07:01.355 --> 07:03.555
     Or try and assassinate
     the president.

07:03.557 --> 07:06.057
    Or ruin my date tonight.

07:06.059 --> 07:09.661
  You're not gonna go all
  <i> single very white female</i> on
  me, are you?

07:09.663 --> 07:12.931
  You know, cut your hair like
  peyton, try and crawl into
  bed with me?

07:12.933 --> 07:14.466
      Can't say for sure.

07:14.468 --> 07:16.968
     Crazy brain.
     Kind of a crap shoot.

07:16.970 --> 07:18.737
   What? I'm just giving you
   a heads up.

07:18.739 --> 07:20.038
          Be on guard.

07:23.844 --> 07:25.477
       Mmm, food's here!

07:29.383 --> 07:30.782
   Stop laughing at my socks.

07:30.784 --> 07:32.684
 I'm not laughing at anything.

07:32.686 --> 07:34.753
   Why is he so amused by the
   fact that i wear socks?

07:34.755 --> 07:36.621
    Several pairs. At once.

07:36.623 --> 07:38.123
       My feet get cold.

07:38.125 --> 07:39.958
  I just think it's funny that
  you wear these tiny shorts

07:39.960 --> 07:41.827
   And then 10 pairs of socks
   because you're cold.

07:41.829 --> 07:43.962
   Oh, do you have a problem
   with my tiny shorts?

07:43.964 --> 07:45.697
    Oh, no, none whatsoever.

07:45.699 --> 07:48.433
 Your, uh, short-to-sock ratio
 is bloody brilliant.

07:48.435 --> 07:50.702
   They forgot my
   szechuan dan dan noodles.

07:50.704 --> 07:54.739
   Wow, something other than
   hellfire cheezy puffs
   and hot sauce.

07:54.741 --> 07:57.242
     Hey, i don't have to
     tell you not to talk
     during <i> vertigo,</i> right?

07:57.244 --> 08:00.378
 I don't want to hear about
 how any of the deaths
 are scientifically inaccurate.

08:00.380 --> 08:02.147
        I was just gonna
        eat in my room.

08:02.149 --> 08:04.683
    You have to eat with us.
    Hey, tell her.

08:06.119 --> 08:07.719
         You must stay.

08:07.721 --> 08:09.087
      -Please.
      -(knocking at door)

08:09.089 --> 08:12.357
     My dan dan noodles.
     The evening is saved!

08:16.230 --> 08:19.130
       Hey. Are you okay?

08:19.132 --> 08:22.701
 I got a giant indian to
 throw a sink through a window
 and jumped to freedom.

08:22.703 --> 08:25.303
     Nah, i'm just kidding.
     I checked myself out.

08:25.305 --> 08:26.705
   So, you're feeling better?

08:26.707 --> 08:27.839
          Definitely.

08:29.076 --> 08:30.475
             Great.

08:30.477 --> 08:33.410
  I'm... I'm sorry to
  just stop by. Is ravi here?

08:33.413 --> 08:35.380
 I couldn't get in my place,
 i think he changed the locks.

08:35.381 --> 08:36.982
              Hey.

08:36.984 --> 08:38.650
      Good to see you out
      and about, mate.

08:38.652 --> 08:40.751
 Hey, get your butt in here
 and help us eat all this food.

08:40.754 --> 08:43.889
 Yeah, i've been eating a lot
 of stuff that requires spoons
  for the past week so, um...

08:43.890 --> 08:44.256
          Yeah, sure.

08:48.662 --> 08:52.163
  Did you know there were
  two general tsos,
  both from the qing dynasty?

08:52.165 --> 08:54.799
  This dish was named
  for the one that suppressed
  the dungan revolt.

08:54.801 --> 08:56.935
       No. But i do now.

08:56.937 --> 08:59.471
      Then this chicken
      did not die in vain.

08:59.473 --> 09:03.275
     I can almost taste the
     crushed dreams of
     dungan rebels.

09:03.277 --> 09:06.278
      Okay, are you ready
      to pop this in?

09:06.280 --> 09:09.648
    Oh, remember, guys,
    it's ravi's first time.

09:09.650 --> 09:12.150
    Uh, <i> vertigo</i> virgin here.
    Be gentle with me.

09:13.754 --> 09:15.620
   Maybe not tonight, peyton.

09:19.126 --> 09:22.294
   "an unhinged man is sucked
   into a whirlpool of terror
          and tension."

09:25.899 --> 09:28.133
     -Perhaps another day.
     -Yeah.

09:28.135 --> 09:32.604
  Well, let's watch something
  that's new for all of us.

09:32.606 --> 09:36.174
    So i'm gonna guess that
    no one's gonna let me
    watch <i> harvey,</i> either?

09:38.345 --> 09:41.112
    Some real jimmy stewart
    haters here.

09:41.114 --> 09:44.215
   Has anybody been
   watching <i> zombie high?</i>
   I hear season 2's amazing.

09:44.217 --> 09:46.184
            Oh, i...

09:46.186 --> 09:47.686
  What?
  You used to love that show.

09:47.688 --> 09:49.287
 Major: She's worried about me.

09:49.289 --> 09:51.156
      I knew this guy at
      the mental hospital

09:51.158 --> 09:53.625
 Who kept trying to convince me
 that zombies were
 roaming seattle.

09:53.627 --> 09:55.460
         But i'm okay.

09:55.462 --> 09:57.429
   You want to feel better
   about your mental health?

09:57.431 --> 10:00.432
 Spend a couple of days with
 some clinically insane people.

10:00.434 --> 10:01.700
  I do it every thanksgiving.

10:01.702 --> 10:03.902
     I mean, it's not like
     i believe the guy.

10:03.904 --> 10:06.204
       Zombies? Come on.

10:06.206 --> 10:08.974
       Hellfire devil:
      <i> What a load of crap.</i>

10:08.976 --> 10:13.311
   (chuckling) <i> that dude</i>
  <i> totally believes in zombies.</i>

10:13.313 --> 10:16.715
    <i> And he's gonna find that</i>
    <i> video if you don't</i>
    <i> get to it first!</i>

10:28.061 --> 10:30.528
   -Are you not hearing him?
   -Hearing who?

10:30.530 --> 10:31.930
        Him, the devil.

10:31.932 --> 10:34.733
     <i> Why are we whispering?</i>

10:34.735 --> 10:36.301
        Oh, the devil's
        talking to you.

10:36.303 --> 10:38.203
      So scott e's brain's
      kicking in.

10:38.205 --> 10:39.738
       Unless you're
       hearing him, too.

10:39.740 --> 10:41.272
          Happily, no.

10:43.410 --> 10:46.011
  <i> What's with the complexion,</i>
  <i> girly girl?</i>

10:46.013 --> 10:49.314
   <i> -Mime class just get out?</i>
    -Rude.

10:49.316 --> 10:51.383
        I am concerned.

10:51.385 --> 10:53.485
   But i'm also craving salt
   before sweet.
   Do you think he'd mind?

10:53.487 --> 10:55.120
            <i> Eat me!</i>

10:55.122 --> 10:56.721
    He seemed okay with it.

11:03.196 --> 11:06.531
       -That was fun.
       -Yeah, definitely.

11:06.533 --> 11:08.400
    Do you think we spoiled
    ravi and peyton's date?

11:08.402 --> 11:09.801
       (peyton giggling)

11:11.538 --> 11:13.405
        I think they're
        right on track.

11:13.407 --> 11:17.075
     Hellfire devil:
     <i> Ooh, get me in there!</i>
     <i> I like to watch!</i>

11:17.077 --> 11:19.444
     <i> Yeah, i like it rough!</i>

11:19.446 --> 11:21.613
      (gasping) <i> crush me!</i>

11:22.616 --> 11:24.249
           You okay?

11:24.251 --> 11:25.750
        Empty calories.

11:27.087 --> 11:29.054
   More importantly, are you?

11:30.257 --> 11:31.890
 You sure you want to go home?

11:31.892 --> 11:34.359
    Last time you were there
    you got attacked.

11:34.361 --> 11:37.062
  You don't need to rush these
  things, our couch is free.

11:37.064 --> 11:39.030
          Yeah, but...

11:39.032 --> 11:41.700
    I'm kind of dying to try
    our sweet new deadbolts.

11:47.374 --> 11:49.140
   -(sighs) okay then, night.
   -Good night.

11:58.285 --> 11:59.851
            (sighs)

11:59.853 --> 12:01.486
         Hellfire devil:
        <i> Hey, whitey!</i>

12:01.488 --> 12:03.354
      <i> Wanna see my o-face?</i>

12:04.725 --> 12:06.224
       (knocking at door)

12:13.200 --> 12:16.668
   You know what? I'm kind of
   dreading going back there.

12:16.670 --> 12:18.203
        Were you serious
        about the couch?

12:25.112 --> 12:27.979
    Here's a pack of cutlery
    in case you can't wait
    until you get home.

12:30.317 --> 12:31.883
    Not exactly finger food,
    is it?

12:31.885 --> 12:34.719
        No. It's brains.

12:34.721 --> 12:36.287
   But i can get you fingers
   if that's your thing.

12:38.325 --> 12:40.925
    We haven't talked
    in a while, lieutenant.

12:42.462 --> 12:45.396
 I was beginning to think that
 i hurt your feelings.

12:45.398 --> 12:48.333
 A lot of tears on the pillow,
 but i'm past it now.

12:52.105 --> 12:55.640
 I should probably tell you who
 we found cradling the body
 of your friend lowell,

12:55.642 --> 12:57.642
     Sobbing her eyes out.

12:57.644 --> 12:59.744
      That zombie who
      works in the morgue.

13:01.848 --> 13:03.815
    Yes, you should tell me.

13:03.817 --> 13:06.217
  Was she there
  in a professional capacity?

13:06.219 --> 13:08.586
  She was dating the deceased.

13:08.588 --> 13:10.922
   Gotta wonder if she was in
   the loop on his plan

13:10.924 --> 13:12.557
     To skewer your head
     with a barbecue fork.

13:12.559 --> 13:13.925
              Oh.

13:14.861 --> 13:16.394
        And in your, uh,

13:16.396 --> 13:18.329
     Professional opinion?

13:18.331 --> 13:21.132
 She seemed to buy it when
 we ruled his death a suicide.

13:23.937 --> 13:25.570
         In the future,

13:25.572 --> 13:28.273
      Remember that i like
      my information

13:28.275 --> 13:30.308
       The same way you
       like your brains.

13:31.144 --> 13:32.944
        -Unconditional?
        -Fresh.

13:38.418 --> 13:39.984
        What's all this?

13:39.986 --> 13:41.653
              Mmm.

13:41.655 --> 13:43.221
 Do you have a quarter-million
 dollars on you?

13:44.858 --> 13:46.491
     Then you don't really
     need to know.

13:50.931 --> 13:52.964
  <i> Where's astronaut alan york?</i>

13:52.966 --> 13:54.532
        <i> The fifth man to</i>
        <i> walk on the moon</i>

13:54.534 --> 13:56.935
  <i> Was a no-show at a bellevue</i>
  <i> book signing yesterday.</i>

13:56.937 --> 13:59.437
  <i> -Houston, we have a problem.</i>
   -(chuckles)

13:59.439 --> 14:02.407
<i> And if you hate</i>
<i> chilly weather, you might have</i>
<i> a problem the next few days.</i>

14:02.409 --> 14:03.908
   <i> Isn't that right, johnny?</i>

14:03.910 --> 14:06.578
   It's not going to be
  <i> dark side of the moon</i> cold,

14:06.580 --> 14:10.315
 But, yes, we are definitely in
 for some sweater weather.

14:10.317 --> 14:13.785
     <i> Or, in aaron's case,</i>
     <i> ugly sweater weather.</i>
     (laughing) <i> am i right?</i>

14:17.991 --> 14:19.624
  What the hell are you doing?

14:21.695 --> 14:23.795
       Weatherman:
      <i> ...That's for sure.</i>

14:23.797 --> 14:26.764
   <i> Anyway, we will have a</i>
   <i> big storm front coming in</i>
   <i> from canada</i>

14:26.766 --> 14:28.199
      <i> Across the border...</i>

14:28.201 --> 14:32.270
     Clive, i saw something
     at blooming grove.

14:32.272 --> 14:35.139
    The woman scott e was
    having sex with had her
    legs up in the air,

14:35.141 --> 14:37.809
   The way you do when you're
   trying to get pregnant.

14:37.811 --> 14:39.611
     He was none too happy
     about being a father.

14:41.414 --> 14:42.981
        Oh, god, sorry.

14:42.983 --> 14:44.716
  Geez, liv, get a nanny cam.

14:44.718 --> 14:47.585
    You know, if you walk in
    on me one more time

14:47.587 --> 14:49.921
   I'm gonna have to mention
   it in my airbnb review.

14:49.923 --> 14:51.422
       Meanwhile, you're
       the perfect guest.

14:52.259 --> 14:53.491
        You sleep okay?

14:53.493 --> 14:54.893
        Ah, good enough.

14:54.895 --> 14:57.795
 But i'm burning daylight, liv,
 and i need a job.

14:57.797 --> 15:01.232
    I'm the early bird,
    ready to get that worm.

15:01.234 --> 15:03.968
  (yawning) so look out, worm,
  i'm coming at you.

15:03.970 --> 15:06.070
      Maybe you should
      get some more sleep.

15:06.072 --> 15:07.872
   Yeah, you could be right.

15:07.874 --> 15:10.174
   This couch wasn't exactly
   built for sleeping.

15:10.176 --> 15:13.044
     I'm sorry, innkeep,
     looks like you're down
     to four stars...

15:13.046 --> 15:14.345
    Feel free to use my bed.

15:18.385 --> 15:19.751
    I can't find his phone.

15:19.753 --> 15:21.786
      This says he
      checked in with one.

15:21.788 --> 15:23.955
  Well, my partner might have
  already come by
  and picked it up.

15:23.957 --> 15:26.157
     -Detective babineaux?
     -He hasn't been in.

15:26.159 --> 15:29.661
    But i do have
    the visitors records
    he asked us to provide.

15:29.663 --> 15:33.431
  This is everyone who visited
  scott e during
  his hospitalization.

15:40.707 --> 15:42.307
           Holy crap.

15:42.309 --> 15:44.976
      Thanks for
      talking to us, brie.

15:44.978 --> 15:47.078
     You were seen outside
     of scott e's room

15:47.080 --> 15:49.147
 Just before he was found dead.

15:49.149 --> 15:50.815
      What were you doing
      at that time?

15:50.817 --> 15:52.850
     Walking down the hall.

15:52.852 --> 15:56.654
  You have the same kind eyes
  my daddy had...

15:58.558 --> 16:00.591
    ...Before i burned down
    his car dealership.

16:03.196 --> 16:04.862
   Let's talk about scott e.

16:05.799 --> 16:07.899
  I heard you two would, um...

16:07.901 --> 16:09.334
      ...Consort together.

16:09.903 --> 16:12.170
           (giggles)

16:12.172 --> 16:15.340
       If by "consort"
       you mean "screw,"

16:16.042 --> 16:17.575
           Then sure,

16:17.577 --> 16:20.244
      We "consorted"
      like bunny rabbits.

16:20.246 --> 16:22.213
      Hellfire devil: <i> Liv.</i>

16:22.215 --> 16:25.683
   <i> -Liv.</i>
   -Brie: I believe in man's
   inherent nature.

16:25.685 --> 16:27.986
Ever read <i> the book of lucifer?</i>

16:27.988 --> 16:30.755
 Just a verse or two before bed
 each night,

16:30.757 --> 16:33.124
   Curled up with a warm mug
   of ghost blood.

16:33.126 --> 16:34.525
         (tut-tutting)

16:34.527 --> 16:36.594
     Don't mock the devil,
     clive babineaux.

16:36.596 --> 16:39.297
       Are you saying
       you're the devil?

16:39.299 --> 16:41.566
       No, i'm merely one
       of his minions.

16:41.568 --> 16:43.968
         Hellfire devil:
        <i> Join me, liv.</i>

16:43.970 --> 16:45.236
            Stop it!

16:45.672 --> 16:46.938
              Liv?

16:48.808 --> 16:51.576
   (sighs) are you pregnant?

16:51.578 --> 16:53.544
      Are you kidding? No.

16:53.546 --> 16:55.713
      That's the only pill
      i always take.

16:55.715 --> 16:57.682
     Hellfire devil:
    <i> Way to take charge, liv.</i>

16:57.684 --> 16:59.283
  I'm sorry, can we take five?

17:03.857 --> 17:05.857
  I thought she'd never leave.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.825
    Enough, you're
    embarrassing yourselves.

17:07.827 --> 17:10.461
   Hellfire devils: (chanting)
  <i> we know who the killer is.</i>

17:10.463 --> 17:12.163
   <i> We know who the killer is!</i>

17:12.165 --> 17:14.699
     Yeah, well,
     if you're so smart,
     why are you in there?

17:15.135 --> 17:16.401
            (sighs)

17:21.107 --> 17:22.272
  Stupid thing ate my dollar.

17:26.445 --> 17:29.747
    Ravi, have you ever had
    a dozen bags of chips

17:29.749 --> 17:31.549
     Shouting, "who killed
     the kennedys" at you?

17:31.551 --> 17:33.117
      Look who dropped by.

17:35.455 --> 17:36.854
       Long time, sister.

17:37.891 --> 17:39.524
          Hey, there.

17:39.526 --> 17:41.225
    Wasn't sure
    we'd ever see you again.

17:41.895 --> 17:43.161
           Nice tan.

17:43.163 --> 17:45.163
     Just checking up
     on the cure progress,

17:45.165 --> 17:48.166
    And the good doctor here
    suggested i get a little
       check-up of my own.

17:48.168 --> 17:51.502
 I was just telling him we were
 hoping max rager may unlock
 some clues

17:51.504 --> 17:53.304
     To the pathology of
     your shared condition.

17:55.108 --> 17:59.210
 -Seeing as how it played a
 role in the initial outbreak.
 -Exactly.

17:59.212 --> 18:00.745
 So i'd like to get your vitals
 immediately after

18:00.747 --> 18:02.980
 You consume some,
 see if that triggers anything.

18:02.982 --> 18:04.382
       You're the doctor.

18:04.384 --> 18:07.351
 Uh, there should be a few
 max ragers in the fridge, liv.

18:07.353 --> 18:09.087
       Would you mind
       grabbing us some?

18:20.333 --> 18:23.134
    Liv: <i> Now that i found him</i>
   <i> this is my chance.</i>

18:26.973 --> 18:28.473
          Here you go.

18:31.311 --> 18:32.910
            Classy.

18:32.912 --> 18:34.912
      I normally take this
      in the can.

18:34.914 --> 18:37.748
  It seems like we should both
  see where we're at together.

18:37.750 --> 18:39.217
          Right, liv?

18:42.288 --> 18:43.821
           After you.

18:47.260 --> 18:48.626
        Live to the max.

19:00.740 --> 19:02.406
              Ooh.

19:11.084 --> 19:12.483
     So what happens next?

19:26.399 --> 19:27.565
       Am i still alive?

19:28.668 --> 19:30.568
    Sometimes i can't tell.

19:30.570 --> 19:33.738
 I'm seeing a slightly elevated
 bp. But no cause for concern.

19:35.275 --> 19:38.176
  I'm up five points systolic,
  two points diastolic.

19:38.178 --> 19:39.410
            (groans)

19:40.079 --> 19:42.413
     I miss it, don't you?

19:42.415 --> 19:45.316
      An occasional
      rush of adrenaline?

19:45.318 --> 19:47.385
   The kind we could get
   before we were half-dead.

19:48.621 --> 19:51.556
     I need you two focused
     on a cure.

19:51.558 --> 19:53.391
       All our free time
       is devoted to it.

19:53.393 --> 19:56.894
    If the people of seattle
    would just quit
    murdering each other.

19:56.896 --> 19:58.829
   Did ravi tell you
   about our latest delivery?

19:59.666 --> 20:01.098
      From blooming grove?

20:01.100 --> 20:02.400
        Scott eberhard.

20:04.237 --> 20:07.672
    Scott e. What happened?

20:07.674 --> 20:09.807
      That's what we're
      trying to determine.

20:09.809 --> 20:11.375
        Utopium dealer.

20:11.377 --> 20:14.212
    Went off the deep end
    after everything he saw
    out on lake washington.

20:14.214 --> 20:15.413
 I thought you might know him.

20:16.416 --> 20:18.282
       Old running buddy.

20:18.284 --> 20:20.651
   I swung by a few times
   and played chess with him.

20:20.653 --> 20:24.155
  Did he ever tell you he shot
  a boat party video?

20:24.157 --> 20:26.157
   He said it featured
   some very special guests.

20:27.994 --> 20:29.260
            Zombies?

20:31.231 --> 20:33.297
    Uh-huh. A zombie video.

20:34.834 --> 20:36.467
 Never came up. I wish it had.

20:38.137 --> 20:39.637
  It was good to see you, liv.

20:39.639 --> 20:41.072
    Let me know if you
    want the name of someone

20:41.074 --> 20:43.307
     Who can do something
     about that skin tone.

20:43.309 --> 20:44.976
      Like one of those
      self-hating zombies.

20:45.578 --> 20:46.877
             As if.

20:53.820 --> 20:55.219
            Cyanide.

20:55.221 --> 20:57.355
        Botulinum toxin.

20:57.357 --> 21:00.958
  I'm sure you considered all
  the options we had on hand
     to end blaine's life.

21:00.960 --> 21:03.060
      I thought about it.

21:03.062 --> 21:04.895
     A bullet in the heart
     won't kill a zombie.

21:04.897 --> 21:07.531
     I couldn't be sure
     what poison would do.

21:07.533 --> 21:11.402
 And if it were lethal, i'd
 have had two dead zombies
 and a very guilty conscience.

21:11.404 --> 21:13.571
    Yeah, i wouldn't want to
    put you out.

21:14.707 --> 21:17.208
    We spoke to
    scott e's psychiatrist.

21:17.210 --> 21:20.478
  She said you and he
  were actually pretty tight.

21:20.480 --> 21:23.347
    I wanted to drill down
      on that without liv
    rushing to your rescue.

21:25.318 --> 21:28.386
     We played chess.
     We didn't exchange
     friendship bracelets.

21:28.388 --> 21:29.754
       But i'll tell you
       anything i know.

21:31.524 --> 21:34.325
    All right, did scott e
    talk about anything else

21:34.327 --> 21:35.893
        Other than chess
        and the devil?

21:35.895 --> 21:37.595
  Yeah. Getting out, i guess.

21:37.597 --> 21:38.963
    What did he want to do?

21:38.965 --> 21:40.865
  Meet a nice girl,
  settle down, start a family?

21:40.867 --> 21:43.701
 Hardly. He went off on
 a whole rant about it one day

21:43.703 --> 21:45.970
    About how he'd screw up
    a kid if he had one.

21:45.972 --> 21:48.205
      Any idea what
      motivated that rant?

21:48.207 --> 21:49.640
          Not a clue.

21:49.642 --> 21:51.409
  The world being such a
  kid-friendly place and all.

21:56.349 --> 21:57.915
      Sir, can i help you
      with something?

22:00.019 --> 22:01.552
        I remember you.

22:01.554 --> 22:03.587
         Johnny frost.

22:03.589 --> 22:06.691
   Tv weatherman and
   solicitor of prostitutes.

22:06.693 --> 22:09.794
     Yes, well, i'm just as
     god made me.

22:09.796 --> 22:12.330
   Really?
   Those teeth are god-given?

22:12.332 --> 22:14.932
 I'm here to identify the body
 of scott eberhard.

22:14.934 --> 22:16.600
       You're his friend?

22:16.602 --> 22:19.837
  The one who worked
  in local tv? He's over here.

22:27.814 --> 22:31.082
       (sighs) poor kid.

22:31.084 --> 22:34.518
   First time he was busted
   his parents disowned him.

22:34.520 --> 22:36.754
       Well, he's in a
       better place now.

22:36.756 --> 22:39.190
       One that's always
       75 and sunny.

22:39.859 --> 22:41.225
     How did you know him?

22:41.227 --> 22:42.460
     He was my pot dealer.

22:43.429 --> 22:44.628
              Oh.

22:44.630 --> 22:48.265
    I became something of an
    uncle-figure to scott e.

22:48.267 --> 22:51.102
      This might be
      a strange question,

22:51.104 --> 22:53.904
       But did he ever
       give you a video?

22:53.906 --> 22:58.309
   He could have e-mailed it
   to you or handed you a
   memory stick or dvd.

22:58.311 --> 22:59.677
        A video of what?

22:59.679 --> 23:01.112
 The lake washington massacre.

23:02.448 --> 23:04.348
     He was never the same
     after that night.

23:04.350 --> 23:06.484
    It's still an open case.

23:06.486 --> 23:10.521
  We heard that he took camera
  phone video that evening
  that could shed some light.

23:10.523 --> 23:13.023
    Well, he never gave me
    anything like that, but,

23:13.025 --> 23:15.659
  I know where he
  stashed his valuables. Uh...

23:15.661 --> 23:17.161
       I could show you.

23:20.299 --> 23:21.966
      Looks like we're in
      for some rain

23:21.968 --> 23:24.435
  As we head to our high today
  of 63 degrees,

23:24.437 --> 23:26.470
   That's 17 degrees celsius.

23:27.440 --> 23:29.273
        He kept a key in
        that fake rock.

23:30.009 --> 23:31.542
             Nice.

23:40.119 --> 23:41.685
       The place has
       been burglarized.

23:42.488 --> 23:44.955
    Tv's here. Stereo, too.

23:50.329 --> 23:52.496
       The stash is here.

23:52.498 --> 23:54.231
       Right where you
       said it would be.

23:54.233 --> 23:56.066
   Yes, yes, but my head shot

23:56.068 --> 23:57.668
    Used to hang right here.

23:59.972 --> 24:03.240
     Hey, you want to slip
     <i> harold & kumar</i> into
     the dvd player,

24:03.242 --> 24:04.842
   Make some grilled cheeses?

24:04.844 --> 24:07.478
   Kill an afternoon the way
   scott e and i used to do.

24:07.480 --> 24:10.047
      His laptop.
      Maybe it's on here.

24:13.719 --> 24:16.320
 Oh, if this couch could talk.

24:16.322 --> 24:19.223
 I used to sneak away at night
 while my wife lay asleep

24:19.225 --> 24:22.159
     In her room,
     like a salmon on ice.

24:22.161 --> 24:26.330
  Oh, i'd get super high with
  scott e and we'd ponder
  the big questions.

24:26.332 --> 24:27.865
       Beatles or stones?

24:27.867 --> 24:29.467
        Kirk or picard?

24:32.839 --> 24:34.589
         Ren or stimpy?

24:34.590 --> 24:36.340
   He's got, like,
   hundreds of hours of
   world chess championships

24:36.342 --> 24:38.576
     But no lake washington
     videos, damn it.

24:38.578 --> 24:40.611
     Oh, don't let those
     storm clouds roll in.

24:40.613 --> 24:43.347
    You've got the laptop,
    you can find the phone,
          can't you?

24:44.684 --> 24:46.917
 You're a genius, johnny frost.

24:46.919 --> 24:49.153
       (thunder cracking)

24:52.325 --> 24:53.858
    Liv: This is the place.

24:55.862 --> 24:58.062
      An apartment number
      would be nice.

24:58.064 --> 24:59.830
    You can't exactly search
    all the units.

24:59.832 --> 25:02.266
    (exhales) are you okay?

25:02.268 --> 25:03.901
   Your face looks frostbit.

25:04.437 --> 25:05.870
         Hang in there.

25:05.872 --> 25:09.306
    I'm predicting highs of
    63 degrees tomorrow,
    that's 17 celsius.

25:09.308 --> 25:12.443
 That's what you said it would
 be today, but it felt
 a lot colder.

25:12.445 --> 25:14.945
 (chuckles) leave the weather
 to the professionals, sweetie.

25:15.882 --> 25:17.448
    Liv: We need some luck.

25:17.450 --> 25:19.984
     We're not gonna be the
     only people looking
     for this video.

25:25.258 --> 25:27.758
    (sighs) this is where
    the computer should be.

26:10.836 --> 26:12.403
 I can smell the weed in here.

26:12.405 --> 26:14.204
   You wanna try to find it?

26:14.206 --> 26:17.675
 It's not worth the effort now
 that the state's gone legal.

26:17.677 --> 26:20.277
  The whole neighborhood's
  about to get a contact high.

26:24.150 --> 26:25.516
          (clattering)

26:41.267 --> 26:42.833
 Wind must have blown it over.

26:43.970 --> 26:45.970
   Let's get this over with.

26:45.972 --> 26:47.871
    If that video exists,
    no one needs to see it.

27:26.512 --> 27:29.213
        (sirens wailing)

27:55.608 --> 27:57.541
           (snoring)

28:08.254 --> 28:10.487
          -(gasps)
          -hey! Look.

28:10.489 --> 28:12.656
   I know that guy
   from the mental hospital.

28:12.658 --> 28:15.159
 That's the orderly who was
 working the day of the murder.

28:15.161 --> 28:17.861
    Check the number
    on that spot, we'll know
    which unit is his.

28:21.967 --> 28:23.667
     Come on, you got this!

28:24.637 --> 28:26.070
     Don't strain yourself.

28:26.072 --> 28:28.138
   Sorry, damn rotator cuff.

28:37.283 --> 28:39.083
       Your hair is fine.

28:39.085 --> 28:42.486
  Oh, my vanity is the issue,
  not your breaking
  and entering.

28:42.488 --> 28:44.288
      (cell phone ringing)

28:47.359 --> 28:49.159
     Hey, liv,
     the toilet's ringing.

29:01.207 --> 29:02.539
            Jackpot.

29:02.541 --> 29:04.007
        Scott e's phone.

29:06.412 --> 29:09.046
        -And oxycodones.
        -Oxies, roxies,

29:09.048 --> 29:11.648
    -Killers, green devils,
    hillbilly heroin...
    -(cell phone ringing)

29:11.650 --> 29:13.016
      Johnny-feel-goods...

29:13.652 --> 29:15.018
     Needs an access code.

29:15.955 --> 29:19.356
    Yeah, and i need
    some johnny time. Sorry.

29:24.430 --> 29:25.863
        <i> Merci beaucoup.</i>

29:25.865 --> 29:27.698
     Liv: <i> Clive,</i>
    <i> i've just had a vision.</i>

29:27.700 --> 29:29.967
      <i> The orderly we saw</i>
      <i> at the crime scene,</i>

29:29.969 --> 29:32.102
    He's stealing patients'
    personal effects.

29:32.104 --> 29:34.638
    He stashed scott e's
    cell phone in his toilet

29:34.640 --> 29:37.074
    Along with enough oxies
    to open a pharmacy.

29:37.076 --> 29:40.077
      That's quite
      the detailed vision.

29:40.079 --> 29:43.080
    But it's gonna take more
    than your crystal ball
    to get a search warrant.

29:43.082 --> 29:45.582
  Okay. Got it. See you later.

29:48.921 --> 29:52.489
      (pop music playing
      loudly from stereo)

29:54.627 --> 29:56.794
      Man: <i> 911 operator,</i>
     <i> what's your emergency?</i>

29:56.796 --> 29:59.563
       Hey, my neighbor's
       having a party.

29:59.565 --> 30:01.298
     It is out of control!

30:02.001 --> 30:03.433
         That's right!

30:09.408 --> 30:11.008
              Yes.

30:25.124 --> 30:27.624
       Hey. You're home.

30:29.161 --> 30:31.128
       How'd it go today?

30:31.130 --> 30:33.764
  The job search? Not so good.

30:35.801 --> 30:37.601
        I should move...

30:37.603 --> 30:39.503
        ...To the couch.

30:39.505 --> 30:40.938
         In a minute...

30:56.522 --> 30:57.888
      (cell phone ringing)

31:03.062 --> 31:06.096
     -What's up.
     -Clive: <i> Last night,</i>
     <i> right after we hung up</i>

31:06.098 --> 31:08.665
        Dispatcher got a
        noise complaint.

31:08.667 --> 31:11.401
    Officers arrived to find
    music blaring

31:11.403 --> 31:13.570
     And a trail of
     schedule ii narcotics

31:13.572 --> 31:15.906
   Visible through the
   front window of guess who.

31:15.908 --> 31:17.140
           Liv: Uh...

31:17.142 --> 31:19.576
Clive: <i> Meet me at the station.</i>

31:19.578 --> 31:23.080
  When you see who
  i've brought in don't bother
  acting surprised.

31:23.082 --> 31:24.982
       You're looking at
       real prison time.

31:24.984 --> 31:27.217
   Possession with
   the intent to distribute.

31:27.219 --> 31:28.652
           Ten years.

31:29.955 --> 31:31.255
           (sniffles)

31:32.758 --> 31:34.758
        You coming down
        with something?

31:34.760 --> 31:37.194
  Oh, no, it's just one of
  the problems of being around
  sick people all day.

31:39.865 --> 31:42.432
     Okay. Listen, i, uh...

31:42.434 --> 31:45.335
     I pawned a lot
     of the clients stuff,

31:45.337 --> 31:46.837
       The ones who died.

31:46.839 --> 31:48.672
 But i would never kill anyone.

31:48.674 --> 31:50.908
    Why wasn't scott's phone
    with the others?

31:50.910 --> 31:53.443
       I could have sworn
       it was there.

31:53.445 --> 31:57.314
     What about the pills?
     Where'd you get those?

31:57.316 --> 31:59.016
       Ten years is
       a long time, jeff.

32:03.088 --> 32:04.288
          Dr. Larson.

32:05.925 --> 32:07.090
          Dr. Larson?

32:07.826 --> 32:09.226
             Yeah.

32:10.863 --> 32:13.563
 She wrote me a 'scrip so that
 i'd keep my mouth shut.

32:14.733 --> 32:17.467
  A few months ago i walked in
  on scott e

32:17.469 --> 32:19.236
 And dr. Larson doing the deed.

32:20.973 --> 32:23.707
   Hopefully the kid
   will have his personality.

32:26.111 --> 32:27.411
     Dr. Larson's pregnant?

32:29.415 --> 32:31.949
     -Something like this?
     -That's it.

32:31.951 --> 32:34.017
              Yes.

32:34.019 --> 32:36.820
      That is exactly what
      i saw in my vision.

32:36.822 --> 32:38.689
     What is going on here?

32:38.691 --> 32:40.357
   You don't have a warrant.

32:40.359 --> 32:42.359
            (groans)

32:42.361 --> 32:45.329
   The duty nurse invited us
   to wait in the room.

32:45.331 --> 32:47.664
    We didn't open
    any drawers or closets.

32:47.666 --> 32:49.666
  But there was plenty
  right out here in the open.

32:49.668 --> 32:51.034
       Pregnancy pops...

32:51.036 --> 32:53.270
      <i> What to expect when</i>
      <i> you're expecting.</i>

32:53.272 --> 32:55.305
   My pregnancy is no secret.

32:55.307 --> 32:58.141
  My husband and i have been
  trying for a very long time.

32:58.143 --> 33:01.211
  Is this your dad? He must be
  very excited to be
  a grandfather.

33:01.213 --> 33:02.612
       That's my husband.

33:02.614 --> 33:04.881
        Hellfire devil:
        <i> Geezer must be</i>
        <i> shooting dust.</i>

33:04.883 --> 33:07.784
    How's your husband going
    to feel about raising
    another man's baby

33:07.786 --> 33:08.952
    While you're in prison?

33:08.954 --> 33:11.088
     This magical thinking
     you're exhibiting

33:11.090 --> 33:13.290
      May be an early sign
      of dementia.

33:13.292 --> 33:15.092
    I can recommend somebody
    if you'd like.

33:15.094 --> 33:17.961
  <i> Ooh, she's got a couple</i>
  <i> of brass ones, doesn't she?</i>

33:17.963 --> 33:19.229
           You mind?

33:21.367 --> 33:23.500
         <i> Here's satan!</i>

33:25.037 --> 33:27.004
        Oxmoor college?

33:27.006 --> 33:28.805
    So you're a blue demon.

33:28.807 --> 33:32.509
 Maybe you had some idea why
 scott e lived in constant fear
 of the devil?

33:32.511 --> 33:34.044
      I see what
      you're insinuating.

33:34.847 --> 33:36.580
     But you have no proof.

33:36.582 --> 33:39.683
  Just an eyewitness who saw
  the two of you <i> in flagrante.</i>

33:39.685 --> 33:41.251
         Hellfire devil:
        <i> Boom shakalaka!</i>

33:41.253 --> 33:44.588
  And that baby's dna is gonna
  tell the definitive story.

33:44.590 --> 33:47.891
     You have no proof
     that i had anything to
     do with scott's death.

33:47.893 --> 33:49.259
 Clive: We're working on that.

33:49.261 --> 33:51.294
    But my guess is
    you're going to confess

33:51.296 --> 33:54.765
 To the murder when you realize
 it'll spare you from
 a paternity test.

33:54.767 --> 33:57.434
  No mom would want the family
  that emotionally abused

33:57.436 --> 34:00.337
     And abandoned scott e
     raising that child.

34:05.177 --> 34:08.712
   Scott told me if i didn't
   abort the baby, he would
   tell everyone everything.

34:11.949 --> 34:13.850
   It was scott or the baby.

34:13.851 --> 34:16.887
       Dr. Maddy larson,
       you have the right
       to remain silent.

34:18.157 --> 34:21.158
     Anything you say can,

34:21.159 --> 34:23.293
  And will be used against you
  in a court of law.

34:23.295 --> 34:25.661
   Hellfire devil: (stammering)
  <i> that's all, folks!</i>

34:25.664 --> 34:27.764
    I don't know how
    she lives with herself.

34:27.766 --> 34:31.101
 She violated every conceivable
 moral and ethical code

34:31.103 --> 34:34.204
 Because she thought that life
 had cheated her out of
 the happiness she deserves.

34:34.206 --> 34:36.072
     You sure i can't help?

34:36.074 --> 34:38.007
  And be an even more perfect
  houseguest?

34:39.511 --> 34:40.911
            No way.

34:42.047 --> 34:44.380
      I can't imagine
      what got into her...

34:53.158 --> 34:54.591
             Whoa.

34:55.194 --> 34:56.460
         What was that?

34:57.563 --> 34:59.529
     Tell me why
     we can't be together.

35:00.799 --> 35:02.399
      I know you love me,

35:04.269 --> 35:06.036
      But my head goes to
      dark places.

35:07.773 --> 35:10.874
      Did... Did you cheat
      on me or

35:10.876 --> 35:12.209
    Did i start to bore you?

35:17.816 --> 35:20.851
   You know how scott e said
   there were zombies
   at the boat party?

35:23.455 --> 35:24.521
             Yeah.

35:25.424 --> 35:26.857
         He was right.

35:27.826 --> 35:29.025
          I saw them.

35:33.165 --> 35:34.831
     Don't kid about this.

35:34.833 --> 35:37.267
   I just checked myself out
   of a mental hospital.

35:37.269 --> 35:39.302
   I'm not kidding.
   I wouldn't do that to you.

35:43.775 --> 35:46.910
    Zombies really do exist.

35:48.947 --> 35:50.280
            They do.

35:54.686 --> 35:56.086
 And one of them scratched me.

35:58.857 --> 36:00.423
             So...

36:04.596 --> 36:06.329
           You're...

36:08.000 --> 36:09.299
      You're one of them?

36:15.140 --> 36:17.641
    Your hair, your skin...

36:20.512 --> 36:22.212
    That's why you
    called the wedding off.

36:24.583 --> 36:26.483
     The people who killed
     jerome and eddie...

36:29.087 --> 36:30.353
            Zombies?

36:31.823 --> 36:33.123
             Yeah.

36:33.659 --> 36:35.458
            (sighs)

36:35.460 --> 36:37.494
    How does it feel to
    finally know the truth?

36:43.268 --> 36:44.634
            Better.

36:50.943 --> 36:52.609
           (sobbing)

37:03.322 --> 37:04.921
         Careful, man.

37:04.923 --> 37:06.423
 This stuff is like moon dust.

37:06.425 --> 37:09.626
    Mind-expanding,
    space-travel moon dust.

37:09.628 --> 37:11.928
   My platinum-level clients
   are very excited.

37:12.731 --> 37:15.465
     $200,000. Right here.

37:15.467 --> 37:18.468
 Is it worth it? I don't know.
 How much is 10 trips
 to the moon worth?

37:18.470 --> 37:20.036
       Luta: Boss! Boss!

37:21.540 --> 37:23.773
  They're gone. All my orders.

37:23.775 --> 37:24.841
   Wait. What are you saying?

37:24.843 --> 37:26.643
    I loaded 'em in the car.

37:26.645 --> 37:29.579
 I came back in to take a leak,
 and when i went back out,
 they were gone.

37:34.019 --> 37:36.086
           (sighing)

37:36.088 --> 37:37.587
            Yeah...

37:37.589 --> 37:39.356
      I'm so sorry, boss.

37:39.358 --> 37:41.825
  I'll get 'em back, no matter
  what i'm gonna get it back

37:41.827 --> 37:43.660
       And it's not gonna
       happen again...

37:43.662 --> 37:44.794
           (gasping)

37:50.869 --> 37:52.936
        (sighs) get up.

37:52.938 --> 37:54.704
     We've got work to do.

37:59.544 --> 38:02.545
 Ravi: <i> And in zombie state, the</i>
<i> subject remains aggressive.</i>

38:02.547 --> 38:04.047
       Though, with each
       subsequent dose,

38:04.049 --> 38:07.183
 I've succeeded in returning
 vital signs to normal levels.

38:07.185 --> 38:10.553
 But i'm running out of
 materials for experimentation.

38:10.555 --> 38:12.689
  If i don't find a cure soon,

38:12.691 --> 38:15.659
   I won't have enough
   tainted utopium to use
   on a human-zombie subject.

38:27.673 --> 38:29.472
     Zombie rat is no more.

38:31.843 --> 38:34.110
       I have a template
       for the cure.

38:35.280 --> 38:37.514
     More testing required,
     but i'm close.

38:39.685 --> 38:41.151
           So close.

38:41.153 --> 38:43.687
  Ten thousand possible
  combinations on this phone.

38:43.689 --> 38:47.457
   I've tried 300 and i feel
   like my thumb is gonna
   fall off.

38:47.459 --> 38:48.525
    Do you want to do a few?

38:48.527 --> 38:50.293
  I can't risk it, hon. Sorry.

38:50.295 --> 38:53.430
      These hands have
      to be camera-ready.

38:53.432 --> 38:55.498
   Female anchor on tv:
  <i> Apollo astronaut alan york,</i>

38:55.500 --> 38:59.169
   <i> One of only 12 astronauts</i>
   <i> to ever walk on the moon,</i>

38:59.171 --> 39:03.373
    <i> Is now officially listed</i>
    <i> as missing, according to</i>
         <i> seattle police.</i>

39:03.375 --> 39:06.343
   <i> Two days ago, york failed</i>
   <i> to show up at an east side</i>
   <i> book signing,</i>

39:06.345 --> 39:08.111
<i> And later that day also missed</i>

39:08.113 --> 39:11.247
 <i> -Scheduled appearances...</i>
 -How does an
 american hero just disappear?

39:11.249 --> 39:13.583
   On the bright side,
   a nice day for a manhunt.

39:13.585 --> 39:17.821
   Right now it's 63 degrees,
   that's 17 celsius.

39:17.823 --> 39:19.456
  Why do you keep saying that?

39:19.458 --> 39:22.559
  I went for a coffee and i
  just about froze my ass off.

39:22.561 --> 39:25.061
       I think you need a
       refresher course
       in temperature.

39:25.063 --> 39:26.229
  Johnny on tv: <i> Right, kathi.</i>

39:26.231 --> 39:28.365
    <i> At a time like this,</i>
    <i> our thoughts and prayers</i>

39:28.367 --> 39:31.601
    <i> Are with alan york,</i>
    <i> his family and friends.</i>

39:31.603 --> 39:33.970
   <i> And with anyone who forgot</i>
   <i> to bundle up today,</i>

39:33.972 --> 39:36.773
 <i> It was chilly out there as</i>
 <i> predicted. Ooh, i warned you.</i>

39:36.775 --> 39:38.441
    <i> Chilly, chilly winds...</i>

39:41.913 --> 39:45.048
        Liv: <i> Oh, my god.</i>

39:45.050 --> 39:46.983
  <i> Johnny frost was a delusion.</i>

39:48.987 --> 39:51.654
    <i> It was always scott e's</i>
    <i> brain leading me around.</i>

39:51.656 --> 39:53.990
   <i> Johnny frost probably</i>
   <i> doesn't even know scott e.</i>

39:53.992 --> 39:56.426
    <i> If johnny frost wasn't</i>
    <i> the friend in local tv,</i>

39:56.428 --> 39:58.061
  <i> Then who else has the video?</i>

39:59.531 --> 40:02.265
    63 degrees, 17 celsius.

40:10.242 --> 40:11.875
           <i> It worked.</i>

40:19.317 --> 40:20.884
        <i> Lake washington.</i>

40:27.726 --> 40:30.927
        (all screaming)

40:32.898 --> 40:34.497
           (groaning)

40:39.538 --> 40:41.037
           <i> That's me!</i>

40:48.513 --> 40:50.146
       (knocking at door)

40:50.148 --> 40:51.614
            (sighs)

40:56.054 --> 40:58.621
      Hey, can i come in?

40:58.623 --> 41:00.156
             Sure.

41:07.666 --> 41:08.798
             Um...

41:09.601 --> 41:11.167
  How's the job search going?

41:11.870 --> 41:14.404
          Job search?

41:14.406 --> 41:16.973
 You told me mission one
 was finding a job, didn't you?

41:18.443 --> 41:20.176
     No, it must have been
     someone else.

41:20.178 --> 41:21.778
         Liv, i, uh...

41:21.780 --> 41:24.214
      (sighs) i've got to
      show you something.

41:24.216 --> 41:27.083
  Don't freak out, all right?

41:27.085 --> 41:28.384
        I wasn't crazy.

41:30.055 --> 41:32.422
      No one else is here,
      right? Peyton?

41:33.358 --> 41:34.958
            Just us.

41:39.397 --> 41:42.031
  It's the world that's crazy,

41:42.033 --> 41:43.533
      And i've got proof.

41:47.038 --> 41:48.638
     Zombies are real, liv.

41:50.075 --> 41:52.141
       These coolers are
       full of brains.

41:52.143 --> 41:55.512
   Now, it's a lot to absorb,
   i know, but i will
   explain everything.

41:55.514 --> 41:57.780
    And don't worry, 'cause
    i'm gonna kill them.

41:57.782 --> 41:59.616
    I'm gonna kill them all.
