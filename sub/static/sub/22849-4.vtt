00:08.833 --> 00:14.916
Black holes are considered to be
the hellmouths of the universe.

00:15.625 --> 00:19.083
Those who fall inside disappear.

00:19.791 --> 00:20.625
Forever.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.625
But whereto?

00:28.083 --> 00:31.583
What lies behind a black hole?

00:31.666 --> 00:33.375
WHERE (WHEN) IS MIKKEL?

00:33.458 --> 00:37.375
Along with things,
do space and time also vanish there?

00:37.458 --> 00:40.458
Or would space and time

00:40.541 --> 00:44.291
be tied together
and be part of an endless cycle?

00:44.916 --> 00:48.333
What if everything that came from the past

00:49.041 --> 00:52.875
were influenced by the future?

00:54.041 --> 00:55.458
Tick-tock.

00:55.958 --> 00:57.500
Tick-tock.

00:58.083 --> 00:59.333
Tick-tock.

00:59.875 --> 01:01.083
Tick-tock.

01:01.833 --> 01:02.833
Tick-tock.

01:03.875 --> 01:05.166
Tick-tock.

02:35.791 --> 02:40.458
DOUBLE LIVES

02:48.666 --> 02:50.625
The sneaky little bitch.

02:50.708 --> 02:52.625
Elli! Where's my lipstick?

02:56.833 --> 02:58.250
-Good morning.
-Morning.

03:02.583 --> 03:05.375
I'm going to stop by the home
to see Dad before work.

03:05.458 --> 03:06.291
Okay.

03:06.791 --> 03:08.833
I'll take Elisabeth to school.

03:08.916 --> 03:10.666
I don't want her to go by herself.

03:12.958 --> 03:13.791
All right.

03:26.291 --> 03:31.416
WINDEN CAVES

03:33.875 --> 03:36.375
WHERE IS THE CROSSING?

03:51.791 --> 03:53.250
There you are, you stupid cow!

03:56.500 --> 03:58.583
Where's my red lipstick?

03:59.166 --> 04:01.833
I don't have your stupid lipstick.

04:01.916 --> 04:05.583
I'm only eight. I don't use lipstick.

04:05.666 --> 04:07.750
You may be able
to fool those two upstairs

04:07.833 --> 04:09.541
with your puppy-dog eyes

04:09.625 --> 04:11.875
and your pitiful deaf-and-dumb act,

04:11.958 --> 04:13.958
but I don't buy it.

04:21.875 --> 04:24.250
Have you packed your backpack?
I'll drive you.

04:24.916 --> 04:26.541
Shall I take you too?

04:26.625 --> 04:28.041
Am I a baby or what?

04:28.708 --> 04:30.375
Because of Mikkel?

04:30.875 --> 04:32.250
Yes, because of Mikkel.

04:32.708 --> 04:35.250
Do you know who stole him?

04:35.333 --> 04:37.291
I won't discuss police work with you.

04:38.666 --> 04:41.041
I don't like Mikkel.
He's a show-off and a jerk.

04:42.958 --> 04:45.291
I don't really care if he ever comes back.

04:54.125 --> 04:54.958
Hey!

04:56.375 --> 04:57.833
Where are you going?

04:58.333 --> 04:59.333
To school.

04:59.416 --> 05:01.541
You don't have to go if you don't want to.

05:01.625 --> 05:03.125
I can call them.

05:05.041 --> 05:06.291
I'm fine.

05:09.625 --> 05:10.958
Jonas?

05:15.041 --> 05:17.291
We could also do something nice together.

05:18.458 --> 05:19.875
Just the two of us.

05:20.291 --> 05:21.416
Mom.

05:23.583 --> 05:24.625
Okay.

05:33.833 --> 05:36.125
REST HOME WINDEN

05:42.583 --> 05:43.708
Dad?

05:46.875 --> 05:48.666
You can't keep walking off.

05:49.541 --> 05:51.083
I have to tell him.

05:52.250 --> 05:53.875
Tell who what?

05:56.750 --> 05:58.375
I have to tell him.

05:59.458 --> 06:01.125
It has to stop.

06:03.791 --> 06:05.291
It has to stop.

06:05.375 --> 06:06.666
It has to...

06:09.541 --> 06:11.041
What has to stop?

06:11.125 --> 06:13.125
Tick-tock.

06:37.541 --> 06:39.083
Don't be sad.

06:40.875 --> 06:43.583
Weeks ago, in the small town of Winden,

06:43.666 --> 06:46.458
a 15-year-old boy disappeared
under mysterious circumstances.

06:46.541 --> 06:47.833
MISSING

06:47.958 --> 06:51.125
Residents are now alarmed
after a second child has gone missing.

06:51.250 --> 06:54.791
11-year-old Mikkel
has been missing for two days.

06:54.875 --> 06:57.916
Please report any relevant information
to the Winden police.

07:00.625 --> 07:03.750
There have been repeated blackouts
in recent months

07:04.625 --> 07:06.708
Security and public facilities

07:06.791 --> 07:09.250
have not yet been...

07:09.708 --> 07:12.375
However,
power grid operators are promising

07:12.458 --> 07:17.541
to find the cause of the cuts and ask
the public to report further incidents.

07:18.625 --> 07:20.416
CAUTION!
WILDLIFE OBSERVATION CAMERA

07:45.083 --> 07:47.000
Did you just steal something?

07:48.000 --> 07:51.291
I confiscated something,
there's a big difference.

07:51.833 --> 07:55.166
Whatever you call it,
it's still the same thing.

08:54.500 --> 08:56.250
I'll pick you up afterwards.

08:56.333 --> 08:58.875
I want you to wait for me, okay?

09:01.500 --> 09:03.041
What did I just say?

09:03.125 --> 09:04.708
That you'll pick me up.

09:07.916 --> 09:08.916
Who's he?

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
Yasin. We're dating.

09:11.708 --> 09:13.291
You're doing what?

09:13.375 --> 09:15.791
Yasin is my boyfriend.

09:15.875 --> 09:17.541
That's how you say it nowadays.

09:18.875 --> 09:20.208
Well then...

09:40.958 --> 09:42.750
A web of symbols and references

09:43.000 --> 09:44.541
runs through the novel.

09:44.625 --> 09:48.958
The "sycamores by the sea" are an example
of this plethora of symbolism.

09:49.041 --> 09:52.708
A special form of repetition
in Goethe's work is what we call doubling.

09:52.791 --> 09:55.583
The characters
consciously and unconsciously...

10:04.916 --> 10:06.583
Magnus, this isn't your class.

10:08.125 --> 10:09.208
Won't you continue?

10:10.625 --> 10:11.458
Where was I...?

10:12.041 --> 10:14.958
Symmetry is a special kind of doubling.

10:15.416 --> 10:18.125
The repetition is mirrored
along a central axis.

10:18.416 --> 10:21.333
So, the repetition begins
at an imaginary center point

10:21.416 --> 10:24.625
and branches off
in two opposing directions.

10:25.208 --> 10:29.666
There are several encrypted references
to later events in the novel.

10:29.750 --> 10:31.750
Ottilie's starvation, for example,

10:31.833 --> 10:34.333
is referenced
in the third chapter of part one,

10:34.416 --> 10:37.666
as her "excessive abstemiousness
in eating and drinking."

10:37.750 --> 10:40.291
This reference is again repeated later.

10:40.916 --> 10:42.291
I have to go to the bathroom.

10:42.791 --> 10:44.416
Yes. Sure.

11:01.750 --> 11:04.250
I'm no ornithologist, but...

11:04.333 --> 11:06.333
these white speckles on the feathers

11:06.416 --> 11:08.166
are not typical of this species.

11:09.416 --> 11:12.125
Let's have a look at what killed you.

11:14.500 --> 11:16.125
Any news on the boy?

11:16.833 --> 11:19.583
Mikkel?
Disappeared off the face of the earth.

11:19.666 --> 11:21.958
No, not Mikkel. The dead boy.

11:22.041 --> 11:23.208
Oh, yes.

11:24.333 --> 11:25.458
No.

11:25.541 --> 11:29.166
We ran everything through
the missing persons database. No match.

11:32.750 --> 11:34.250
Everything okay with you?

11:38.541 --> 11:39.625
Yeah...

11:41.916 --> 11:42.916
No.

11:43.666 --> 11:46.041
I've seen spots like that
on feathers before.

11:46.916 --> 11:48.291
Thirty-three years ago.

11:50.708 --> 11:52.541
As if all this has happened before.

11:54.583 --> 11:55.583
The children,

11:56.750 --> 11:57.958
the birds...

12:00.500 --> 12:02.291
Somehow it's all connected.

12:02.375 --> 12:03.958
I just don't know how.

13:06.375 --> 13:09.625
Where have you been?
The phones have been ringing all morning.

13:09.708 --> 13:12.000
Someone must've said something
about the dead boy.

13:12.083 --> 13:13.375
What am I supposed to say?

13:13.458 --> 13:16.166
-Is Ulrich here?
-No, why?

13:16.250 --> 13:19.083
Go through
the missing persons database again.

13:19.166 --> 13:21.500
Include older reports this time.

13:21.958 --> 13:25.500
He may have disappeared a long time ago.
Check the last 15 years, okay?

13:26.041 --> 13:27.333
Right, okay.

13:27.416 --> 13:29.625
-Anything else?
-No. Actually, there is.

13:29.708 --> 13:31.083
The red soil...

13:31.166 --> 13:34.166
We can't find any.
Not anywhere close to where he was found.

13:34.250 --> 13:36.125
It must've come from the crime scene.

13:36.208 --> 13:38.125
Get Jankowski to look into it.

13:39.958 --> 13:42.083
And what do we say about the dead boy?

13:59.875 --> 14:01.000
What time is it?

14:01.791 --> 14:03.291
Just past ten.

14:09.958 --> 14:11.500
Charlotte called.

14:12.208 --> 14:15.375
She still doesn't have
a search warrant for the power plant.

14:17.541 --> 14:20.458
It's been nearly 36 hours, Ulrich.

14:47.958 --> 14:48.791
MISSING

14:51.166 --> 14:52.833
TIME OF DISAPPEARANCE 9:30 - 10:30 PM

15:29.166 --> 15:32.125
Should I continue with the tire tracks?
Seeing as Ulrich isn't in yet.

15:33.500 --> 15:34.583
Tire tracks?

15:37.625 --> 15:40.500
The treads we found on the road
the day Erik disappeared.

15:40.583 --> 15:42.083
No, I'll do that myself.

15:42.916 --> 15:45.041
-I can take it off your hands...
-I'll do it!

15:46.000 --> 15:46.875
Okay.

15:51.666 --> 15:54.208
-What's...
-A screenshot from a wildlife camera.

15:54.291 --> 15:56.416
I thought it might give us something.

15:58.375 --> 16:00.041
Are you done with the database?

16:00.958 --> 16:01.958
No.

16:02.041 --> 16:04.708
Then why are you asking me
about tire tracks?

16:06.291 --> 16:07.458
Fine.

17:05.708 --> 17:06.791
Charlotte?

17:07.708 --> 17:08.791
Is everything okay?

17:09.125 --> 17:13.375
I missed your call
on the evening Mikkel disappeared.

17:13.458 --> 17:15.375
I never asked why you called.

17:15.833 --> 17:17.333
Why did you call?

17:17.416 --> 17:18.500
I...

17:19.416 --> 17:20.750
I don't know, I...

17:21.583 --> 17:24.500
I think I was just calling
to say I'd be home late.

17:25.333 --> 17:26.833
Nothing special.

17:27.458 --> 17:29.875
You were at the office
all day on Monday?

17:30.500 --> 17:31.625
Yes... Yeah.

17:32.875 --> 17:34.541
I was writing reports

17:34.625 --> 17:37.291
until around ten in the evening.

17:37.375 --> 17:38.208
Why do you ask?

17:38.291 --> 17:39.916
TIME OF DISAPPEARANCE 9:30 - 10:30 PM

17:40.875 --> 17:42.125
No reason.

17:42.666 --> 17:45.083
I had something mailed to the office,

17:45.166 --> 17:48.208
and I'd forgotten about it.
I was just wondering if it arrived.

17:49.250 --> 17:50.916
We haven't received anything.

17:52.791 --> 17:53.708
Okay.

17:55.833 --> 17:56.833
Okay.

19:56.083 --> 19:57.916
I'm allowed to be parked here.

19:59.166 --> 20:01.875
I want to know
if Peter Doppler was one of your clients.

20:03.125 --> 20:04.416
Last Monday.

20:05.125 --> 20:06.833
Can I see your badge again?

20:13.666 --> 20:15.125
Charlotte Doppler.

20:18.083 --> 20:20.541
Is it a private or professional question?

20:22.333 --> 20:24.125
Does it make any difference?

20:26.625 --> 20:28.666
Was he here on Monday?

20:37.958 --> 20:38.916
Not necessary.

20:39.833 --> 20:41.791
I never forget a dick.

20:42.833 --> 20:45.541
Peter's is slightly crooked,
like a dill pickle.

20:46.125 --> 20:47.541
Feels weird in the mouth.

20:47.625 --> 20:50.750
-You probably know that already.
-Was he here on Monday or not?

20:58.166 --> 21:00.500
No, he hasn't been back in over a year.

21:02.541 --> 21:04.958
He must get what he needs
somewhere else now.

21:05.041 --> 21:05.958
Thanks.

22:07.000 --> 22:07.833
Fuck.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.750
The beginning is the end,

22:15.833 --> 22:17.958
-and the end is the beginning.
- Shit.

22:20.750 --> 22:22.750
The beginning is the end,

22:23.708 --> 22:25.666
and the end is the beginning.

22:27.750 --> 22:29.583
The beginning is the end...

22:30.125 --> 22:32.000
I left my kids at home today.

22:32.666 --> 22:33.750
My mom's there.

22:34.791 --> 22:35.958
She's looking after them.

22:36.583 --> 22:39.208
Supposedly they found
a body in the forest.

22:39.916 --> 22:40.750
You see...

22:41.000 --> 22:44.625
I have this pathologist friend, he said...

22:44.708 --> 22:46.666
it's terribly mutilated.

25:26.208 --> 25:28.041
-Yup?
-Guess what?

25:28.125 --> 25:30.416
-The bird has the same thing.
-Has what?

25:30.916 --> 25:33.416
Burst eardrums on both sides.

25:33.500 --> 25:35.750
-And that's how it died?
-No.

25:35.833 --> 25:39.833
It probably died from losing its bearings
and crashing into the ground.

25:39.916 --> 25:41.041
Cracked skull.

25:41.125 --> 25:45.416
It happens often. Electromagnetic fields
interfere with their sensory systems.

25:45.500 --> 25:47.125
-High voltage power lines?
-No.

25:47.208 --> 25:49.625
We're talking voltages
in the radio wave spectrum.

25:49.708 --> 25:50.958
Electrical appliances.

25:51.041 --> 25:54.000
-And the white spots in the feathers?
-The white spots...

25:54.083 --> 25:57.291
They started appearing after Chernobyl.
It's a kind of mutation.

25:57.375 --> 25:59.083
Radiation contamination?

25:59.166 --> 26:01.500
I checked,
but the radiation levels are normal.

26:02.375 --> 26:04.583
-Interesting.
-It sure is.

26:05.208 --> 26:07.041
-Anything else?
-Nope.

26:12.208 --> 26:15.916
And did you know the girl snails
bite the willies off the boy snails?

26:16.000 --> 26:18.125
You definitely made that one up.

26:19.041 --> 26:22.791
I didn't. Then the boys
keep crawling on as girls. No joke.

26:24.625 --> 26:26.041
-Where did you come up with that?
-Hey!

26:26.125 --> 26:28.125
-There you are, Yasin.
-Television.

26:28.500 --> 26:29.875
Let's go. Grandma's waiting.

26:36.666 --> 26:39.208
Should I give you a ride home?

26:40.083 --> 26:41.583
My mom's picking me up.

26:41.666 --> 26:43.583
I'll drive you home.

26:43.958 --> 26:45.333
It's no problem.

26:45.416 --> 26:49.041
My mom will be here any moment now.

26:49.125 --> 26:51.083
She's the Chief of Police.

26:51.500 --> 26:52.666
Okay.

26:54.666 --> 26:55.625
Come on.

28:44.708 --> 28:45.625
Yes?

28:47.208 --> 28:48.625
He did what?

29:02.708 --> 29:04.500
What the fuck?

29:07.458 --> 29:08.625
What's this?

29:09.166 --> 29:11.625
Money, you idiot. My money.

29:12.250 --> 29:14.000
Why do you have so much money?

29:14.500 --> 29:16.166
Are you dealing drugs?

29:16.250 --> 29:17.875
Is that why you were at the caves?

29:17.958 --> 29:20.333
How I earn my money
is none of your damn business.

29:21.708 --> 29:23.333
What are you going to do with it?

29:24.125 --> 29:28.000
What am I going to do with it?
I'm getting out of this phoney shithole.

29:28.583 --> 29:31.625
Behind everyone's friendly smile
there's nothing but lies.

29:32.250 --> 29:33.625
You're no different.

29:34.458 --> 29:37.291
You pretend to be the straight-A student,
but that's not you.

29:38.291 --> 29:41.541
-Maybe you should start telling the truth.
-You want the truth?

29:41.625 --> 29:42.625
Fine.

29:43.625 --> 29:46.333
My parents have slept
in different beds for over a year.

29:46.708 --> 29:49.833
My mom found out
that Dad's actually into dicks.

29:50.375 --> 29:52.791
Their marriage is over,
but no one will say it.

29:53.791 --> 29:56.958
Instead, this big fat secret
is always with us at the table.

29:57.041 --> 30:00.583
It eats our bread rolls,
the butter and the homemade jam.

30:01.000 --> 30:05.125
It gets fatter and fatter,
until there's no space left in the room.

30:06.125 --> 30:07.416
Until you can't breathe.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.083
-Did you forget something?
-No.

31:00.208 --> 31:03.083
You have to pick up Elisabeth from school.
I can't make it.

31:04.500 --> 31:07.416
I have a patient.
I have to go to the office.

31:07.958 --> 31:09.833
Just pick her up, okay?

31:09.916 --> 31:11.500
She can wait at your office.

31:11.875 --> 31:13.666
I have to go to the power plant.

31:14.291 --> 31:15.583
Okay, I'll...

31:17.291 --> 31:18.833
I'll pick her up.

31:18.916 --> 31:20.083
Thank you.

31:20.166 --> 31:21.333
Was that it?

31:21.416 --> 31:22.458
Wait.

31:23.041 --> 31:25.250
You made me a promise a year ago.

31:27.250 --> 31:30.083
If there's anything at all
you want to tell me...

31:36.333 --> 31:39.125
Hey, I really have to get going,
or else I'll be late.

32:31.083 --> 32:32.125
Tick-tock.

33:30.125 --> 33:30.958
Excuse me.

33:31.958 --> 33:34.083
I'm here to pick up Elisabeth.

33:34.875 --> 33:37.291
I thought she had already been picked up.

33:37.375 --> 33:38.208
What?

33:38.541 --> 33:41.250
Mrs. Clemens is sick.
School finished at two today.

33:41.791 --> 33:43.541
Didn't Elisabeth tell you?

33:44.833 --> 33:46.666
It was written in her homework book.

33:57.458 --> 34:01.583
Security found him on our grounds,
close to the caves.

34:02.041 --> 34:03.958
He must've climbed over the fence.

34:15.750 --> 34:18.041
He hasn't been very cooperative.

34:31.583 --> 34:34.083
You're lucky
Aleksander isn't pressing charges.

34:36.208 --> 34:39.500
Everyone understands your situation.
Everyone.

34:40.041 --> 34:41.791
But climbing over the fence?

34:42.708 --> 34:44.708
Understanding is nice, thank you.

34:45.875 --> 34:47.500
But it's not enough.

34:50.291 --> 34:52.125
My child is gone, okay?

34:52.208 --> 34:54.250
This isn't just some file on your desk.

34:54.333 --> 34:55.833
It's my child.

34:57.708 --> 34:58.958
Why Mikkel?

34:59.041 --> 35:01.500
I keep asking myself that.
Why him? Why my son?

35:01.583 --> 35:03.500
Why not his son?

35:03.583 --> 35:05.125
Why not his?

35:06.708 --> 35:08.291
I'm being punished.

35:09.500 --> 35:13.625
And all I get is fucking sympathy.
Well, you can take that and shove it.

35:13.708 --> 35:15.250
Where's the search warrant?

35:15.333 --> 35:17.291
Why is no one doing anything?

35:17.958 --> 35:20.875
Should I tell you why?
Because it's not his kid.

35:22.166 --> 35:24.125
And because it's not your kid.

35:26.500 --> 35:28.125
Stop here, I want to get out.

35:30.250 --> 35:31.375
Stop the car!

35:52.791 --> 35:55.041
-Yes?
-Elisabeth wasn't there.

35:55.625 --> 35:57.250
What do you mean not there?

35:57.333 --> 35:59.333
She wasn't at school.

35:59.416 --> 36:01.291
Mrs. Clemens is sick.

36:01.375 --> 36:03.375
She wasn't waiting there.

36:03.458 --> 36:06.958
I've been up and down the forest road
twice already, but she's not here.

36:07.416 --> 36:10.375
Maybe someone from school took her home?
Maybe Yasin?

36:10.458 --> 36:11.875
Go back home.

36:11.958 --> 36:14.791
Maybe she went a different way.
Call everyone in her class.

36:15.250 --> 36:16.916
I'll be there in 15 minutes.

37:26.416 --> 37:27.750
Yes, all right.

37:29.791 --> 37:30.958
Thank you.

37:35.791 --> 37:37.791
I've called everyone on the list.

37:38.375 --> 37:39.583
Nothing.

40:00.375 --> 40:02.000
I have to tell him.

40:02.666 --> 40:04.208
He has to stop.

40:33.708 --> 40:34.791
I lost my hat.

40:35.708 --> 40:37.125
Where were you?

40:37.916 --> 40:40.833
You didn't pick me up, so I walked.

40:41.500 --> 40:44.458
And that took you this long?

40:45.833 --> 40:47.375
I met someone.

40:53.666 --> 40:55.708
He gave me this.

40:56.250 --> 40:57.333
Who did?

40:57.416 --> 40:59.375
Ouch! You're hurting me.

40:59.458 --> 41:02.416
I want to know who gave this to you.

41:02.500 --> 41:03.541
Noah.

41:04.541 --> 41:06.750
Who is Noah?

41:07.333 --> 41:10.666
He said it used to belong to you.

41:16.125 --> 41:17.791
-You are all cold...
- Elli?

41:19.041 --> 41:20.125
Elli, is that you?

41:26.166 --> 41:27.916
I was so worried about you.

41:30.958 --> 41:32.458
Where were you?

41:41.416 --> 41:42.875
Hands off my stuff!

41:49.541 --> 41:50.541
Hello?

41:51.208 --> 41:52.041
Yes.

41:53.125 --> 41:54.125
No, she's here now.

41:54.208 --> 41:55.500
Just now.

41:56.791 --> 41:57.625
What?

42:00.083 --> 42:01.708
Yes, I'll be right there.

42:03.791 --> 42:07.291
Wöller found Helge in the woods.

42:10.458 --> 42:13.541
FOR CHARLOTTE

42:21.166 --> 42:25.333
We're searching for Ariadne's thread,

42:26.083 --> 42:29.750
the one meant
to guide us along the right path.

42:31.375 --> 42:34.875
A beacon in the darkness.

42:36.500 --> 42:40.000
We'd love to know our fate.

42:41.083 --> 42:43.166
Where we're headed.

42:45.625 --> 42:50.958
But the truth is that there is
but one path through all times.

42:52.958 --> 42:56.666
Predetermined by the beginning

42:56.750 --> 42:58.791
and by the end.

43:00.125 --> 43:02.583
Which is also the beginning.

43:14.708 --> 43:15.833
He has to stop.

43:17.750 --> 43:19.166
Who has to stop?

43:19.250 --> 43:20.958
I have to stop him.

43:21.583 --> 43:22.458
Stop whom?

43:25.458 --> 43:26.291
Noah.

43:40.791 --> 43:43.583
I'm not a baby anymore.

43:43.666 --> 43:47.750
I can go to school on my own!

44:09.791 --> 44:11.208
You must be Yasin.

44:12.750 --> 44:14.000
Noah sent me.

47:03.375 --> 47:07.375
