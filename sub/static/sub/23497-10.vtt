Did you have a good weekend?

01:21.790 --> 01:24.417
Spending time with my daughters
always makes me feel warm and fuzzy.

01:24.501 --> 01:25.585
Nerd!

01:25.669 --> 01:27.129
I'm kidding!
I had fun, too.

01:27.212 --> 01:29.632
-Have a good day, kiddo.
-I will.

01:30.548 --> 01:32.092
I love you guys.

01:32.175 --> 01:35.053
Oh, the nerd apple doesn't fall far
from the nerd tree.

01:35.137 --> 01:36.221
What? I do.

01:36.304 --> 01:37.389

Wow! Looks better than I thought.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.541
Yeah, I mean,
I think people are really gonna dig this.

02:46.624 --> 02:47.625
Yeah.

02:48.251 --> 02:50.587
What?
Allergic to compliments there, big guy?

02:50.670 --> 02:52.840
I just got a text.
It's from Tristan.

02:52.923 --> 02:55.383
-Is he okay?
-He's coming to the play.

02:55.467 --> 02:57.344
--Isn't that great news?

02:57.928 --> 02:59.888
I'm just worried that if he sees it,
he's gonna figure out--

02:59.972 --> 03:01.724
You and Lola are hooking up?

03:03.141 --> 03:05.936
I knew it! You owe me a 20
and you're a dirtbag for cheating.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.354
No, look, it was just one time.

03:07.437 --> 03:08.646
And it was when Tristan
was still in a coma.

03:08.731 --> 03:10.733
I didn't think
that we were getting him back.

03:10.816 --> 03:12.901
It didn't mean anything.

03:12.985 --> 03:15.695
Be honest. If he sees this thing,
is he gonna guess what happened?

03:15.779 --> 03:18.406
Hey, man, we directed the thing,
and we still weren't sure, so...

03:18.490 --> 03:21.034
Well, I can't have him finding out
in a room full of people.

03:22.870 --> 03:25.080
Aren't you excited
to see Rasha perform tonight?

03:25.163 --> 03:28.250
I didn't get to see her this morning,
'cause she left early for the tech run.

03:28.333 --> 03:29.752
Do you think she's nervous?

03:31.003 --> 03:32.337
Is that the program for the play?

03:32.420 --> 03:35.298
Shouldn't that be all done
and printed by now?

03:35.382 --> 03:38.218
I was... busy this weekend.

03:38.301 --> 03:39.762
Everything okay?

03:44.391 --> 03:45.517
I'll be fine.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.560
- Okay, well, at least let me help.

03:49.813 --> 03:51.106
There's a typo.

03:54.651 --> 03:56.945
Do you think Rasha's picture
should be bigger than Lola's?

03:57.029 --> 03:58.947
Okay, why don't you do this yourself?

04:00.323 --> 04:02.200
Okay, I don't know anything
about the play!

04:11.794 --> 04:12.961
Oh, thank goodness you're here.

04:13.045 --> 04:15.005
So, the play is a love triangle

04:15.088 --> 04:17.507
between Hero and his boyfriend, Coma Boy,
who's in a coma,

04:17.590 --> 04:19.342
and Hope, some girl he meets online?

04:19.426 --> 04:20.761
What is love, anyway?

04:22.095 --> 04:24.347
Okay, I don't know what's up with you,
or why Zoë's so freaked out,

04:24.431 --> 04:25.557
but I need to get this done.

04:26.809 --> 04:28.351
You know why Zoë's so upset?

04:29.519 --> 04:30.771
Because we broke up.

04:31.939 --> 04:34.566
You... were dating?

04:35.859 --> 04:37.820
-Why didn't you tell me?
-I don't know.

04:37.903 --> 04:39.905
Maybe all the casual homophobia?

04:39.988 --> 04:42.825
-I'm... I'm not, uh--
-Okay, then riddle me this.

04:42.908 --> 04:45.160
Am I sinning if I have sex with Zoë?

04:48.246 --> 04:50.999
According to the Qur'an, yes,
but I still love you guys.

04:51.083 --> 04:52.292
Love the sinner, hate the sin.

04:52.375 --> 04:53.585
See? You get it.

04:53.668 --> 04:55.670
I thought it would be different here.

04:55.753 --> 04:58.882
I'd get to be in a play
and have a girlfriend

04:58.966 --> 05:01.051
who would show up backstage
with a bouquet of roses,

05:01.134 --> 05:02.510
and it would all be perfect, but--

05:02.594 --> 05:05.138
It's not my fault you guys broke up.
I didn't even know!

05:05.222 --> 05:08.016
No, Zoë invited me to her mom's wedding
to make her mom mad.

05:08.100 --> 05:09.476
And her mom was mad.

05:10.978 --> 05:12.520
She kicked her out.

05:12.604 --> 05:13.646
Of the wedding?

05:13.730 --> 05:14.940
Of her house.

05:15.023 --> 05:18.526
Her own daughter?
Just for being gay?

05:18.610 --> 05:19.777
Yeah.

05:20.988 --> 05:22.364
So who's the real sinner?

05:23.531 --> 05:25.075
Today's the day, Degrassians.

05:25.158 --> 05:27.828
Pick up your tickets
for I.M. Hope in the foyer.

05:27.911 --> 05:29.579
Hope to see you there!

05:30.663 --> 05:32.499
Hey, have you seen Grace?

05:32.582 --> 05:34.167
Uh, no, not... not today.

05:35.335 --> 05:36.962
Look,
Esme's gonna be here any second,

05:37.045 --> 05:38.338
and I can't be caught talking to you.

05:38.922 --> 05:40.382
Not after last time.

05:40.465 --> 05:42.550
Right.
Sorry about that.

05:44.970 --> 05:46.972
- Uh...
- Oh!

05:47.055 --> 05:48.098
Thanks.

05:50.267 --> 05:51.309
Hey.

05:51.393 --> 05:54.021
Shaving our heads, eating shards of glass
and bathing in fire ants.

05:54.104 --> 05:55.563
Uh, what?

05:55.647 --> 05:58.441
Three things I'd rather do
than watch Miles' play.

05:58.858 --> 06:02.154
Esme, look, I told you,
we have to support Grace.

06:03.071 --> 06:05.490
-I'm sure it'll be fine.
-Have you met Miles?

06:05.573 --> 06:07.534
- It's gonna be a waking nightmare.

06:14.124 --> 06:15.167
Aw, you shouldn't have.

06:15.250 --> 06:17.127
I didn't. It's for Grace.
Can you give it to her?

06:17.210 --> 06:19.462
Uh, no. You can give it to her yourself
at the play tonight.

06:19.546 --> 06:20.630
She doesn't want me there.

06:20.713 --> 06:23.091
Mmm, well, yeah. I mean,
she might seem a little mad right now,

06:23.175 --> 06:24.927
but, deep down, I know she loves you.

06:25.552 --> 06:27.345
What are you?
The Grace whisperer?

06:27.429 --> 06:29.932
Ah, hardly. But... here.

06:30.015 --> 06:32.350
- It's one of my comp tickets.

06:32.434 --> 06:33.810
You can't turn down
a free ticket, can you?

06:50.160 --> 06:53.413
Programs are ready with 30 minutes
to spare before showtime.

06:55.040 --> 06:56.583
Did your mom really kick you out
for being gay?

06:59.044 --> 07:00.170
Rasha told me.

07:04.216 --> 07:06.343
I really thought my mom
would be able to accept it...

07:08.303 --> 07:09.304
but nope.

07:10.555 --> 07:12.182
So, I guess I live with Grace now.

07:12.265 --> 07:14.726
-That seems a little harsh.
-Strongly agree.

07:14.809 --> 07:17.270
-There's nothing you can do to fix it?
-You got a cure for lesbian?

07:19.022 --> 07:22.150
Worst part is, I was so focused
on chasing this idea

07:22.234 --> 07:24.652
that my mom might actually accept me,

07:24.736 --> 07:26.779
that I screwed things up
with Rasha forever.

07:30.117 --> 07:31.451
Maybe not forever.

07:37.915 --> 07:39.209
-Oh, I'm, uh, sorry! Um...
-Uh...

07:40.961 --> 07:43.338
Hey, actually,
can you come in here for a second?

07:43.421 --> 07:44.589
But you're, um...

07:44.672 --> 07:47.842
It's not like we haven't seen each other
like this before. Right?

07:47.925 --> 07:49.427
Preach. Okay.

07:51.471 --> 07:54.057
Um, so Tristan is coming
to the play,

07:54.141 --> 07:55.433
and he... he can't find out about us.

07:55.517 --> 07:56.559
I know.
I told you, I won't say anything.

07:56.643 --> 07:59.562
I know, I know,
but I just need to change a few lines.

07:59.646 --> 08:01.773
It's not that many.
Here.

08:04.901 --> 08:06.903
Look, I'm sorry
about how this all went down.

08:06.987 --> 08:09.822
The... the timing, the...

08:09.906 --> 08:11.616
I'm sorry I wasn't there for the...
You know--

08:11.699 --> 08:12.909
It's okay. I'm okay.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.452
No, still, I should have been there.

08:18.540 --> 08:19.582
Can I ask you something?

08:22.210 --> 08:25.005
Did I mean anything to you?
Like, at all?

08:28.800 --> 08:31.219
Yeah, you were my hope.

08:51.239 --> 08:52.824
Yeah, that looks totally fine.

08:55.368 --> 08:57.829
I'm pretty sure our seats are over there.

08:57.912 --> 09:00.748
Yeah, but if it gets too creepy,
I want a quick exit.

09:02.917 --> 09:03.960
Okay.

09:05.962 --> 09:07.214
Is that... Is that Tristan?

09:09.507 --> 09:11.468
Best seat in the house,
for the guest of honor.

09:15.638 --> 09:16.806
Isn't it so inspiring?

09:16.889 --> 09:20.185
It's like we can finally
put the bus crash behind us.

09:21.728 --> 09:22.729
Ticket?

09:23.896 --> 09:27.525
Uh, seat 20, in the aisle.

09:28.693 --> 09:30.695
Um, I... I can tell them to move.

09:30.778 --> 09:32.989
No. No. I don't wanna be a bother.

09:33.073 --> 09:37.369
Um, I actually have a thing, anyways.

09:37.452 --> 09:38.703
Could you give this to Grace for me?

09:39.621 --> 09:40.622
Thank you.

11:04.747 --> 11:08.335
Where are you?
Answer me.

11:09.627 --> 11:10.878
I'm worried.

11:13.548 --> 11:14.549
I love you.

11:15.800 --> 11:16.801
Please.

11:19.011 --> 11:22.224
Oh, this is weird.
I'm not used to you being so quiet.

11:25.268 --> 11:26.394
Aah!

11:28.145 --> 11:29.481
You're really in a coma, huh?

11:29.564 --> 11:30.815
Well...

11:30.898 --> 11:32.317
that's okay.

11:33.485 --> 11:35.653
Because I'm not leaving
until you're better.

11:40.825 --> 11:42.744
What am I supposed to do
until you wake up?

12:14.609 --> 12:16.068
Can't do anything right.

12:35.797 --> 12:36.798
Oh, no.

12:39.216 --> 12:40.302
Maya?

12:41.844 --> 12:44.972
Saad, hey.
Can you help me?

12:51.688 --> 12:53.440
Oh, you're the best.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.194
Thank you for being my friend.

12:59.321 --> 13:02.198
I... uh...
You said we weren't friends anymore.

13:02.782 --> 13:05.368
No. Forget about that.

13:05.452 --> 13:06.869
It wasn't me talking.

13:07.537 --> 13:08.871
I always liked you.

13:19.591 --> 13:21.926
There's gotta be something
worth living for?

13:22.009 --> 13:23.386
I'd only miss doing things with Coma Boy.

13:24.178 --> 13:27.223
-Like what?
-We used to play this one game...

13:33.605 --> 13:35.398
You'll never catch me.
I'm faster than you.

13:35.482 --> 13:37.734
- But I'm smarter.

14:30.119 --> 14:32.204
I can't keep doing it.
It's been months of this.

14:32.288 --> 14:33.915
And he's almost better.

14:34.582 --> 14:36.292
-I want to see you, Hope.
-You can't.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.461
He's only made it this far
because you've been by his side.

14:38.545 --> 14:40.422
But I've only made it this far
because you were by mine.

14:40.505 --> 14:42.424
Okay, this is brutal. I can't...

14:42.507 --> 14:44.341
Wait. Where are you going?
It's just getting good.

14:44.426 --> 14:46.719
Come on.
I'll make it worth your while.

14:46.803 --> 14:47.929
Please.

14:50.222 --> 14:51.516
I'm coming.

15:02.151 --> 15:04.195
You shouldn't be here.

15:04.278 --> 15:05.488
I need to touch you.

15:05.572 --> 15:08.491
No. You never needed me.
You needed someone.

15:09.951 --> 15:11.077
And now, he needs you.

15:16.666 --> 15:18.460
Hope?

15:18.543 --> 15:20.587
Hero? Are you there?

15:24.006 --> 15:26.426
Yes. Yes.

15:26.509 --> 15:27.802
And I'm never leaving.

15:54.161 --> 15:56.122
Okay.
Thank you guys so much for coming.

15:56.205 --> 15:57.373
If you... If you enjoyed that,

15:57.457 --> 16:00.710
then I owe it all
to my amazing cast and crew,

16:00.793 --> 16:02.504
and our codirectors.

16:02.587 --> 16:06.758
So let's raise a nonalcoholic bubbly
to them. Shall we?

16:08.801 --> 16:10.636
Okay, enjoy the party, guys.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.188
Can I get your autograph?

16:22.356 --> 16:24.651
I'm so sorry
I used you at my mom's wedding.

16:26.110 --> 16:27.487
Can you ever forgive me?

16:29.280 --> 16:30.990
Of course.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.287
Oh.

16:36.370 --> 16:38.039
Ah, they're everything I dreamed of.

16:38.122 --> 16:40.500
Thank Goldi.
She helped pick them out.

16:43.294 --> 16:45.379
You really helped with this?

16:45.462 --> 16:50.259
I realized that Hero and Coma Boy's love
is no different than anyone else's.

16:50.342 --> 16:52.804
Neither is yours.
You should be together.

16:52.887 --> 16:54.263
Even if we're sinning?

16:54.346 --> 16:56.683
I decided that's not up to me.

16:56.766 --> 16:58.475
I just want you to be happy.

17:03.272 --> 17:05.149
Enjoy your party, superstar.

17:12.156 --> 17:13.324
There you are.

17:14.534 --> 17:17.203
Must have been too loud for you
in Student Council?

17:27.589 --> 17:31.884
So... what'd you think?

17:33.302 --> 17:34.386
Be brutal.

17:34.470 --> 17:36.513
I thought it was beautiful.

17:36.598 --> 17:38.349
It all felt very real.

17:43.229 --> 17:45.648
I hooked up with Lola, Tristan.
I'm so sorry.

17:45.732 --> 17:48.275
The doctors thought that
you weren't going to make it--

17:48.359 --> 17:49.235
I know.

17:51.195 --> 17:52.446
You do?

17:52.529 --> 17:54.949
Between that video she posted
and the play,

17:55.032 --> 17:56.533
it's kind of obvious.

17:58.536 --> 17:59.537
Do you hate me?

18:01.413 --> 18:02.624
Do you love her?

18:03.750 --> 18:05.835
It's over.
I ended it as soon as you woke up.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.128
But did you love her?

18:08.880 --> 18:09.881
I guess, yeah.

18:11.007 --> 18:13.092
I couldn't have made it through everything
without her.

18:14.552 --> 18:15.928
Who do you want to be with?

18:17.346 --> 18:18.555
You.

18:21.517 --> 18:24.436
You saw the play, Tris.
I know that it sounds messed up,

18:24.520 --> 18:27.940
but everything...
everything was about you.

18:29.609 --> 18:30.777
Even Lola.

18:36.448 --> 18:37.449
Okay.

18:40.411 --> 18:41.537
Okay?

18:43.122 --> 18:44.331
Okay.

18:47.835 --> 18:49.671
--I can't believe we pulled it off.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.215
Yeah, yeah, we, uh, we make a good team.

19:00.472 --> 19:03.309
Uh, I guess now that the...
the play's over,

19:03.392 --> 19:05.352
we don't really have an excuse
to hang out anymore.

19:07.521 --> 19:09.231
Maybe we can find one?

19:11.275 --> 19:12.694
Sorry to interrupt.

19:12.777 --> 19:16.113
Um, I'm not really a theater person,
but I really loved that.

19:17.949 --> 19:20.117
Oh, it's not from me.
It's uh, it's from Maya.

19:20.827 --> 19:21.869
She didn't stay and watch?

19:26.582 --> 19:28.167
Why would she give me this?

19:28.250 --> 19:29.836
Let's see it.

19:29.919 --> 19:31.253
I should text her.

19:33.464 --> 19:37.426
Except I forgot that I blocked her
and then she blocked me.

19:37.509 --> 19:40.054
She deleted all of her accounts.

19:40.137 --> 19:41.430
What? Everything?

19:43.515 --> 19:44.809
Except this one picture.

19:49.188 --> 19:50.564
Finally, some privacy.

19:52.775 --> 19:54.318
- I didn't know you could get up here.

19:54.401 --> 19:57.404
Isn't it better than Miles' stupid play?

19:57.488 --> 20:00.241
We crossed off parking lot
on our bingo card,

20:00.324 --> 20:03.452
so I figured I had to look
for some new spots.

20:03.535 --> 20:05.204
Oh, that's why you wanted
to ditch the play.

20:05.287 --> 20:07.206
--Why didn't you just say so?

20:14.671 --> 20:16.716
-Whoa!
-What?

20:16.799 --> 20:18.134
No, look.

20:20.427 --> 20:22.179
Oh, my God!

20:22.263 --> 20:23.472
Maya?

20:23.555 --> 20:25.182
- Oh, my God!

20:26.225 --> 20:28.310
Uh, uh, what do we do?

20:28.394 --> 20:31.355
- She's OD'ing!
- Well, should we try to make her throw up?

20:31.438 --> 20:33.941
No! No. You never do that.
I learned that with my mom.

20:34.984 --> 20:37.653
We have to put her in... in prone position
and call 911!

20:42.116 --> 20:45.661
Uh, hello.
We have an OD'ing female.

20:45.745 --> 20:47.747
We're at Degrassi Community School.

20:47.830 --> 20:49.665
We're at the roof.
Please hurry.

21:07.058 --> 21:08.100
We should have seen this coming.

21:08.976 --> 21:13.314
She deleted all of her social media.
She made that song.

21:13.397 --> 21:15.858
Not to mention
those death photos.

21:17.609 --> 21:19.570
I told her to leave me alone today.

21:19.653 --> 21:21.572
I knew she was sad,

21:21.655 --> 21:23.908
I just didn't think
she'd be capable of this.

21:23.991 --> 21:26.828
Stop.
It's nobody's fault.

21:28.120 --> 21:30.039
No one can know
what's going on inside someone's head

21:30.122 --> 21:32.959
and she didn't want to be here anymore
and now she's getting her wish.

21:33.042 --> 21:35.377
--Okay, come on.

21:35.461 --> 21:36.462
Easy...

21:51.143 --> 21:52.895
She's gonna make it.

22:00.569 --> 22:02.529
I mean,
she's been through something, and...

22:03.739 --> 22:06.242
It's been really hard
and it's gonna be a fight,

22:06.325 --> 22:10.121
but, um, I hope that you guys
stick by her through this.

22:10.204 --> 22:11.247
We will.

22:12.123 --> 22:16.043
Tell Maya I said thanks,
but she'll still be needing this.

22:22.299 --> 22:23.968
Grace.

22:25.844 --> 22:27.804
-I'll be home later.
-Okay.

22:33.310 --> 22:37.106
I can't help but think if things had gone
slightly differently this semester...

22:38.232 --> 22:39.316
that might have been me in there.

22:43.320 --> 22:44.780
People are important.

22:46.365 --> 22:47.866
Can we get pizza?

22:47.950 --> 22:49.368
--It's literally been

22:49.451 --> 22:51.495
six months since I've had pizza.

22:51.578 --> 22:53.705
Sounds good to me.
I'm starving, so...

22:53.789 --> 22:56.042
--How did you survive without pizza?
