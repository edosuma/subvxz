WEBVTT

00:04.046 --> 00:05.797
- Where is he?
- Who?

00:05.797 --> 00:07.633
- My father.
- They moved him

00:07.633 --> 00:10.344
to a yard up in Bangor
by the airport.

00:10.344 --> 00:12.846
Did she even know
what she was signing for?

00:12.846 --> 00:14.848
What else you been
signing for her, Alan?

00:16.183 --> 00:17.726
Oh! The sheets!

00:19.811 --> 00:23.065
Your mom's been leaving food out
for the neighborhood mutt.

00:23.065 --> 00:26.068
We buried it New Year's Day.
Truck.

00:26.068 --> 00:27.903
<i>It's like I open the book</i>

00:27.903 --> 00:30.405
<i>and all the pages,
someone tore them out</i>

00:30.405 --> 00:33.283
- Mom!
- <i>and rearranged them.</i>

00:35.160 --> 00:37.829
<i>I bought her a ring in '91.</i>

00:37.829 --> 00:40.999
<i>Eventually I moved back.
Then I get a phone call.</i>

00:40.999 --> 00:44.002
Somebody heard gunfire
up at your mom's place.

00:44.002 --> 00:46.421
- Gunfire?
- Your mother came to the door,

00:46.421 --> 00:48.632
threw her arms around me,

00:48.632 --> 00:51.051
begged me, "Don't leave!"

00:51.051 --> 00:54.972
If I tell you something,
can you keep your mouth shut?

00:54.972 --> 00:58.684
<i>Life used to go
in one direction,</i>

00:58.684 --> 01:00.519
- <i>but somehow I got off it.</i>
- Ruthie?

01:00.519 --> 01:02.479
<i>The neurologist said,</i>

01:02.479 --> 01:05.524
<i>"Find a coping mechanism,"
and I have.</i>

01:05.524 --> 01:07.568
One for every room in the house.

01:08.860 --> 01:10.320
Damn it!

01:12.739 --> 01:14.533
You're back.

01:14.533 --> 01:16.868
Ruth!

01:20.289 --> 01:22.416
Ruthie?!

01:22.416 --> 01:23.959
<i>Ruthie!</i>

02:16.136 --> 02:19.348
Lady on the internet
says they were made by Vikings,

02:19.348 --> 02:22.351
- so I figured...
- Oh! The Lewis chessmen.

02:22.351 --> 02:25.020
You know, the originals,
they were carved

02:25.020 --> 02:28.023
out of walrus ivory
by the wife of a priest...

02:28.023 --> 02:29.483
Margaret the Adroit.

02:29.483 --> 02:32.611
You are still
the smartest person I know.

02:32.611 --> 02:34.988
Smart enough to know
what you're up to.

02:34.988 --> 02:37.699
Come on. No, come on,
this way.

02:39.034 --> 02:42.245
What else did the internet
teach you?

02:42.245 --> 02:44.873
That chess is good
for the demented brain?

02:47.417 --> 02:50.170
We got any champagne
around this house?

02:50.170 --> 02:51.963
<i>Here's one more
last-minute resolution.</i>

02:51.963 --> 02:53.840
<i>When you're on the road today,</i>

02:53.840 --> 02:56.718
<i>steer clear of the turnpike
from Portland to Augusta.</i>

02:56.718 --> 02:59.221
Where did you run off to?

02:59.221 --> 03:02.557
I splurged...
$30 Japanese steaks.

03:04.017 --> 03:06.061
- What is it?
- Aw, nothin'.

03:06.061 --> 03:08.397
Be back in two shakes.
Set up those chessmen.

03:08.397 --> 03:11.024
I'll let you slaughter me after dinner.

03:28.208 --> 03:31.503
Ruthie, wait in the house.

03:33.088 --> 03:35.715
Did you call...
the veterin...

03:37.259 --> 03:38.718
The clinic?

03:38.718 --> 03:41.388
On South Reserve?

03:41.388 --> 03:43.432
He doesn't need a vet.

03:43.432 --> 03:45.434
SOB came outta nowhere.

03:50.147 --> 03:52.357
She.

03:52.357 --> 03:54.276
Ma'am?

03:54.276 --> 03:56.987
She's not a son of a bitch.
She's a bitch.

04:20.552 --> 04:22.721
We goin' somewhere?

04:24.055 --> 04:26.016
It's for Puck.

04:29.770 --> 04:32.898
Puck was your boy's dog.

04:32.898 --> 04:35.150
Used to leave dead squirrels
on your pillow

04:35.150 --> 04:37.903
like hotel mints, remember?

04:37.903 --> 04:41.740
That dog out there is...
just a neighborhood stray.

04:44.326 --> 04:46.328
I know that.

04:48.330 --> 04:52.167
Did I ever tell you about...
what happened to Puck?

04:55.212 --> 04:59.925
I came home one day, and...

04:59.925 --> 05:02.093
she was just gone.

05:05.472 --> 05:09.601
Matthew said she...
she must have run off.

05:09.601 --> 05:13.313
But I found a box of poison in the trash.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.148
You have no idea.

05:15.148 --> 05:18.527
- What?
- What he was capable of.

05:20.111 --> 05:23.490
I used to see turkey vultures

05:23.490 --> 05:27.536
wheeling around the sky out back...
over the woods,

05:27.536 --> 05:30.413
but I was too chickenshit to go look.

05:33.458 --> 05:35.836
The thought of her
being picked apart,

05:35.836 --> 05:37.420
no one to bury her.

05:40.257 --> 05:44.094
And you think buryin' one dog
pays the debt on the other.

06:19.504 --> 06:21.256
Puck.

06:44.070 --> 06:46.239
They can't do that
without our permission.

06:46.239 --> 06:48.158
Your mother gave it.

06:48.158 --> 06:51.077
And nobody thought to
pick up the phone and call me?

06:51.077 --> 06:53.413
Did she even know
what she was signing for?

06:54.706 --> 06:56.374
You signed for her.

06:56.374 --> 06:59.502
I deposited the distress
settlement for her, too.

07:03.506 --> 07:05.884
What else you been signing for her, Alan?

07:15.644 --> 07:17.520
Oh! The sheets!

08:08.113 --> 08:11.324
OK, dear.
Almost done.

08:12.951 --> 08:15.036
A few minutes ago
I read a list of words

08:15.036 --> 08:16.371
and asked you to repeat them.

08:16.371 --> 08:18.957
Can you repeat them
back to me now?

08:18.957 --> 08:20.834
Any order you like.

08:25.171 --> 08:27.882
Someone sent you flowers.

08:28.883 --> 08:31.720
The mouse ran up the...

08:31.720 --> 08:33.888
- No hints.
- Just give her one

08:33.888 --> 08:35.432
and it'll all come back.

08:35.432 --> 08:36.975
Please, sir.

08:36.975 --> 08:38.852
If you wouldn't mind
just waiting outside?

08:38.852 --> 08:40.895
Yeah, I would mind.
"Dear"?

08:40.895 --> 08:43.940
Do you know how fucking
condescending that sounds?

08:43.940 --> 08:46.484
She has a brain
the size of Portland.

08:50.071 --> 08:52.449
But it's sick, Alan.

08:52.449 --> 08:53.783
Alzheimer's.

08:55.702 --> 08:58.747
Why won't anyone use that...
That word?

08:58.747 --> 09:01.958
There's no diagnostic
test for Alzheimer's.

09:01.958 --> 09:04.002
Confirmation's made postmortem

09:04.002 --> 09:07.088
by examining the brain
for plaques and other hallmarks.

09:07.088 --> 09:10.050
Postmortem?
Let's get the fuck out of here.

09:10.050 --> 09:11.676
We're going to Darden.

09:11.676 --> 09:13.344
Doesn't matter
what we call it.

09:13.344 --> 09:15.263
These things move in one direction.

09:15.263 --> 09:18.933
Higher-order functions
become more challenging.

09:18.933 --> 09:22.103
Your ability to exercise
reason and judgment...

09:22.103 --> 09:26.274
finances, drive a car...
planning and problem-solving...

09:26.274 --> 09:28.777
confusion with time and space...

09:28.777 --> 09:31.488
<i>Confusion</i> with time and space.

09:33.448 --> 09:35.450
She slips up.

09:35.450 --> 09:39.579
And reading and...
the face of my own son.

09:41.956 --> 09:44.542
We can medicate the anxiety

09:44.542 --> 09:48.505
and help you develop systems,
coping mechanisms.

09:48.505 --> 09:51.007
But given the accident,

09:51.007 --> 09:54.469
I think it's time to consider
other living arrangements.

10:01.267 --> 10:02.560
<i>Listen...</i>

10:02.560 --> 10:05.105
that brain doctor,

10:05.105 --> 10:09.109
I don't care how many degrees
she's got on her fuckin' wall...

10:09.109 --> 10:12.278
Don't make me
wash your mouth out.

10:12.278 --> 10:15.573
I knocked on that door after 14 years.

10:15.573 --> 10:17.075
You remember what you said?

10:20.120 --> 10:21.371
"Don't leave."

10:22.497 --> 10:25.083
See? It's all still up there.

10:27.669 --> 10:29.879
Listen, after I get you settled,

10:29.879 --> 10:31.631
I got some business
to take care of,

10:31.631 --> 10:34.968
and when I come back,
I'm not going anywhere,

10:34.968 --> 10:37.220
and neither are you.

10:37.220 --> 10:40.306
We're gonna fix you up
as good as new.

10:40.306 --> 10:42.308
Yeah, I just...

10:42.308 --> 10:45.186
I just need a system, that's all.

11:51.878 --> 11:54.464
"They will not
find their way back home,

11:54.464 --> 11:56.090
and we will be rid of them.

11:56.090 --> 11:58.760
'I refuse, ' said the man.

11:58.760 --> 12:00.303
'How can I bring myself

12:00.303 --> 12:03.056
to abandon my own children
alone in the woods?

12:03.056 --> 12:06.226
Wild animals would tear them
to pieces.'"

12:11.022 --> 12:13.733
"'Oh, you fool, ' said the wife.

12:13.733 --> 12:16.236
'Then all four of us will starve.'

12:16.236 --> 12:19.697
The clever boy filled his jacket
pockets with pebbles,

12:19.697 --> 12:22.075
as many as he could fit.

12:22.075 --> 12:25.245
He would use the stones to lay
a trail through the forest..."

12:25.245 --> 12:27.372
Older then he was when?

12:27.372 --> 12:28.456
Ever.

12:32.043 --> 12:35.255
Is that why you're here?

12:35.255 --> 12:39.133
I was... I was thinkin'
about when you turned seven.

12:39.133 --> 12:42.595
Made a big batch
of that buttercream frosting.

12:42.595 --> 12:45.640
That was before we knew
about your lactose thing.

12:45.640 --> 12:48.685
I never seen a cake disappear
and reappear that fast.

12:50.436 --> 12:52.563
You probably don't remember that.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.414
Magic 101.

13:09.414 --> 13:14.085
This is called...
the French Drop.

13:17.422 --> 13:20.591
This is called palming.

13:20.591 --> 13:24.637
Either holding it
with the creases of your palm,

13:24.637 --> 13:27.432
or what I prefer to do
is to do a thumb palm.

13:27.432 --> 13:30.643
Why do all magic tricks
sound pornographic?

13:30.643 --> 13:32.145
I don't know,

13:32.145 --> 13:33.813
'cause they're invented by virgins.

13:33.813 --> 13:36.190
Here, you try.
Give it a shot. Go ahead.

13:38.735 --> 13:41.446
Stick your...
that's it, you sell it with your thumb,

13:41.446 --> 13:44.157
then just drop it down gently there...

13:46.451 --> 13:49.078
Great. Great. Yeah!

13:49.078 --> 13:50.580
You got it.

13:50.580 --> 13:52.957
You got the French Drop.

13:52.957 --> 13:55.501
Now all you gotta work on is...
palming!

13:55.501 --> 13:58.004
No palming!

14:02.592 --> 14:03.676
Mom?

14:06.596 --> 14:08.514
Picked up a hitchhiker.

14:08.514 --> 14:11.976
Oh! Come over here and give me a hug.

14:11.976 --> 14:13.895
Oh, look at you.

14:15.354 --> 14:16.731
Look at you.

14:19.776 --> 14:22.987
How old is this turkey?

14:22.987 --> 14:26.783
So they dug him up just to stick
him back in the ground again?

14:26.783 --> 14:28.367
Is that a thing up here?

14:28.367 --> 14:30.661
Ask your father.

14:33.498 --> 14:36.042
"Behold, I will tell you a mystery.

14:36.042 --> 14:38.503
Not all will sleep,
but all will be changed,

14:38.503 --> 14:42.465
in a moment,
in the twinkling of an eye...

14:42.465 --> 14:44.217
The last trumpet,

14:44.217 --> 14:47.678
for the trumpet will sound
and the dead will be raised,

14:47.678 --> 14:51.641
imperishable, and we will all be changed.

14:51.641 --> 14:54.477
For this perishable must put on
the imperishable,

14:54.477 --> 14:58.606
and this mortal
must put on immortality.

14:58.606 --> 15:00.942
But when this perishable
put on the imperishable,

15:00.942 --> 15:04.695
and this mortal
put on immortality,

15:04.695 --> 15:05.947
then...

15:08.574 --> 15:12.745
will come about
the saying that is written:

15:12.745 --> 15:15.748
"Death...

15:15.748 --> 15:17.917
is swallowed up in victory."

15:31.514 --> 15:35.434
Hymn 114.
"O God Our Help in Ages Past."

15:49.740 --> 15:52.201
"Swallowed up in victory."

15:52.201 --> 15:54.370
Hardcore.

15:55.913 --> 15:58.583
Mom, I have got lunch under control.

15:58.583 --> 16:00.418
You should stay off your feet.

16:00.418 --> 16:02.336
I thought you were
the only one there.

16:02.336 --> 16:05.506
- Who are all the programs for?
- The church printed 'em up.

16:05.506 --> 16:09.010
They're gonna have
some recycling to do.

16:09.010 --> 16:12.096
I'm serious, Mom,
it's turkey and bread.

16:12.096 --> 16:14.473
Well, you better make his a double.

16:14.473 --> 16:16.017
You want to be an astronaut,

16:16.017 --> 16:17.268
you're gonna need
meat on your bones.

16:17.268 --> 16:18.728
We're past that.

16:18.728 --> 16:21.022
These days he's all about graphic design.

16:29.864 --> 16:33.075
I coulda sworn
we buried him in that suit.

16:33.075 --> 16:35.661
Buried who?

16:35.661 --> 16:37.163
Your father.

16:46.464 --> 16:49.383
Help you out,
get you back on your feet.

18:19.432 --> 18:22.602
- The blanket.
- I made tuna fish salad.

18:24.103 --> 18:26.147
You can say grace.

18:29.108 --> 18:31.819
We'll let the woods say
grace today. Come on. Sit. Sit.

18:56.010 --> 18:59.138
What is that? Matthew.

18:59.138 --> 19:02.058
I've had a beautiful experience,

19:02.058 --> 19:03.934
and I want to share it with you.

19:03.934 --> 19:07.188
Do you know what the Psalms say
about taking your own life?

19:07.188 --> 19:09.398
- Matthew.
- He's fine.

19:10.900 --> 19:12.360
It's stealing.

19:12.360 --> 19:15.613
Because your life belongs to God.

19:19.325 --> 19:21.911
There was a Japanese solider.

19:21.911 --> 19:24.538
World War II.
His masters tell him,

19:24.538 --> 19:26.916
"Whatever happens, don't surrender.

19:26.916 --> 19:30.127
Don't. Take your own life."

19:30.127 --> 19:31.921
So he hides out

19:31.921 --> 19:33.923
on an island in the Philippines.

19:33.923 --> 19:38.010
Leaflets fall from the sky
telling him the war is over.

19:38.010 --> 19:40.513
The Empire's dead.
His masters are dead.

19:40.513 --> 19:43.015
But...

19:43.015 --> 19:44.433
he doesn't believe 'em.

19:44.433 --> 19:47.478
He kept fighting FDR until 1974.

19:47.478 --> 19:50.439
Let's go home.
I have chicken in the fridge.

19:50.439 --> 19:52.817
You look...

19:52.817 --> 19:55.319
at this town, the suffering,

19:55.319 --> 19:58.614
you wonder...
where was God?

19:58.614 --> 20:01.575
Maybe the leaflets fell from the
sky but you didn't believe them.

20:01.575 --> 20:03.786
So...

20:03.786 --> 20:07.707
I took a drive to the Walmart
in Farmington,

20:07.707 --> 20:09.208
and I took a walk here
in the woods

20:09.208 --> 20:10.960
where no one would
have to clean it up,

20:10.960 --> 20:15.256
and I told God that
I couldn't live without proof.

20:15.256 --> 20:18.718
Then I fit the end into my ear like this...

20:18.718 --> 20:20.636
Matthew.

20:24.306 --> 20:26.308
And I heard it.

20:27.351 --> 20:28.436
What?

20:37.319 --> 20:38.904
God.

20:42.283 --> 20:43.993
His voice.

20:48.664 --> 20:50.708
I think we should call Dr. Pierce.

20:50.708 --> 20:52.960
This has nothing to do with Dr. Pierce.

20:52.960 --> 20:54.503
He scraped all that out of me.
I'm healthy.

20:54.503 --> 20:56.422
Just for a scan.

20:56.422 --> 20:59.175
God helps those who help themselves.

21:00.509 --> 21:03.596
They said, "Watch out for symptoms."

21:03.596 --> 21:06.265
Headaches.
Ringing in the ears...

21:06.265 --> 21:08.517
This wasn't a ringing.

21:08.517 --> 21:10.811
Saul heard it on the road to Damascus,

21:10.811 --> 21:12.438
knocked him flat on his back,

21:12.438 --> 21:13.939
when he got up again,
he wasn't Saul.

21:13.939 --> 21:15.608
He was Paul.

21:26.285 --> 21:27.745
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

21:30.331 --> 21:32.416
I can hear it now.

21:34.376 --> 21:36.086
Can you?

21:37.838 --> 21:39.507
No.

21:39.507 --> 21:42.009
We'll just sit here and be quiet.

21:59.693 --> 22:04.156
It's a work thing.
You two OK for a couple hours?

22:04.156 --> 22:05.616
We're good.

22:05.616 --> 22:08.035
<i>Front door open.</i>

22:08.035 --> 22:11.872
So what's the deal
with all the missing pieces?

22:11.872 --> 22:12.957
Grandma?

22:14.458 --> 22:16.836
You're not having a stroke, are you?

22:23.968 --> 22:27.263
If I tell you something...

22:27.263 --> 22:29.890
can you keep your mouth shut?

22:35.980 --> 22:37.064
See,

22:37.064 --> 22:39.108
I can get lost in the past.

22:39.108 --> 22:40.985
These are my breadcrumbs.

22:40.985 --> 22:43.571
If I find a chess piece
in the icebox,

22:43.571 --> 22:46.282
well, I know it's now, not then.

22:47.700 --> 22:50.536
That I can find my way
out of the woods.

22:50.536 --> 22:52.413
Huh...

22:52.413 --> 22:55.416
You think
your grandma's a fruitcake.

22:55.416 --> 22:58.085
No.
You're a Timewalker.

22:58.085 --> 23:01.088
Have you never heard
of <i>Catacomb Drifter</i>

23:01.088 --> 23:03.132
or <i>D For Destiny?</i>

23:10.306 --> 23:14.184
Um, there's twelve levels,
I mean, for now.

23:14.184 --> 23:16.770
You know, they keep adding
expansion packs.

23:16.770 --> 23:18.856
Oh, shit!

23:19.857 --> 23:21.483
Got it.

23:21.483 --> 23:23.068
How do you win?

23:23.068 --> 23:25.613
It's not a game, exactly.

23:25.613 --> 23:27.114
It never ends.

23:27.114 --> 23:30.451
Anyway, Timewalkers
are the most powerful

23:30.451 --> 23:31.952
'cause they're the only avatars

23:31.952 --> 23:33.871
that can actually kill the dead.

23:33.871 --> 23:37.041
The dead, they're everywhere.
See?

23:38.918 --> 23:41.170
Ha! And you know,
they're pissed off,

23:41.170 --> 23:44.381
because we're alive
and they're not.

23:44.381 --> 23:47.593
You gotta stay sharp, because
they can change their skin,

23:47.593 --> 23:49.929
and sometimes even
look like your allies.

23:51.388 --> 23:53.140
Look, there goes another one.

23:53.140 --> 23:55.684
See, what makes it so hard
is that no one stays dead

23:55.684 --> 23:58.437
when you kill them...
Unless you're a Timewalker.

23:58.437 --> 24:01.357
Theoretically, you could just
kill your nemesis

24:01.357 --> 24:03.734
and fix the whole timeline.

24:06.028 --> 24:08.113
But you gotta stay sharp.

24:16.288 --> 24:17.665
Ohh.

24:26.131 --> 24:28.634
<i>Back door open.</i>

24:42.439 --> 24:43.899
You're back.

24:48.320 --> 24:50.572
Go to bed, Ruth.

24:57.830 --> 24:59.623
<i>But a trumpet will sound</i>

24:59.623 --> 25:02.167
<i>and the dead will be raised,
imperishable,</i>

25:02.167 --> 25:03.794
<i>and we will all...</i>

25:03.794 --> 25:06.755
<i>and this mortal
must put on immortality.</i>

25:11.343 --> 25:14.596
<i>Once again,
reporting a suspected arson</i>

25:14.596 --> 25:18.934
<i>at Juniper Hills Hospital,
with 14 confirmed dead.</i>

25:18.934 --> 25:21.228
<i>The suspect considered dangerous.</i>

25:21.228 --> 25:25.274
<i>Police have released a photo,
but not a name.</i>

25:25.274 --> 25:29.028
<i>You can see the smoke
billowing from the rooftop...</i>

25:29.028 --> 25:30.988
Matthew.

25:54.094 --> 25:56.472
Are you living or dead?

25:56.472 --> 26:00.100
Oh, long dead.
Ancient history.

26:00.100 --> 26:01.685
What's your name?

26:01.685 --> 26:05.397
The badass avenger chick
from Gísla Saga. Uh...

26:05.397 --> 26:07.232
- Thordis!
- Oh!

26:07.232 --> 26:09.234
You are your mother's son.

26:09.234 --> 26:11.737
Ah, OK.

26:11.737 --> 26:13.655
Got one.

26:13.655 --> 26:16.241
OK. Who are you?

26:16.241 --> 26:18.994
I'm smaller than a teacup.

26:18.994 --> 26:23.123
Mmm. Smaller than a teacup...

26:29.588 --> 26:31.340
Did you say your prayers?

26:33.842 --> 26:36.053
Yeah.

26:36.053 --> 26:38.180
Did you?

26:43.936 --> 26:45.437
Good man.

26:54.238 --> 26:56.281
He's a little old for that, isn't he?

26:56.281 --> 26:59.201
Watching you take a bath?

26:59.201 --> 27:01.245
Oh, he wasn't.

27:01.245 --> 27:03.372
I'm his mother.

27:03.372 --> 27:05.791
He's not blood.
It's different.

27:08.418 --> 27:11.046
What did you do with the gun?
I don't want it in the house.

27:11.046 --> 27:14.341
God helps those
who help themselves.

27:14.341 --> 27:17.094
Can't rely on the sheriff
to keep our family safe.

27:17.094 --> 27:19.471
- Matthew.
- Top drawer in the dresser.

27:19.471 --> 27:21.390
And before you tell me
it's irresponsible,

27:21.390 --> 27:23.433
the bullets are locked away.

27:24.852 --> 27:26.812
He'll never find them.

27:50.043 --> 27:52.754
<i>Theoretically,
you could just kill your nemesis,</i>

27:52.754 --> 27:54.423
<i>fix the whole timeline.</i>

28:06.435 --> 28:07.769
<i>The bullets are locked away.</i>

28:07.769 --> 28:09.479
<i>He'll never find them.</i>

29:03.283 --> 29:06.453
- Is Henry here?
- No.

29:08.789 --> 29:10.499
Mrs. Deaver!

29:10.499 --> 29:13.961
I think he's... he's lost.
Or in trouble.

29:13.961 --> 29:15.420
I need to find him.

29:16.838 --> 29:19.257
<i>Front door open.</i>

29:19.257 --> 29:21.551
When are we?

29:21.551 --> 29:25.806
OK, Mrs. Deaver, it's important.

29:25.806 --> 29:28.809
I think that something terrible
is going to happen.

29:30.143 --> 29:32.270
It's happened.

29:32.270 --> 29:35.774
I saw you in my bedroom.

29:37.234 --> 29:39.611
You were just a little girl.

29:41.029 --> 29:42.656
I'm sorry.

29:44.533 --> 29:46.660
- I'm so sorry.
- No.

29:46.660 --> 29:48.328
You did right.

29:50.330 --> 29:52.749
But it didn't take.

29:52.749 --> 29:55.293
He's back.

29:55.293 --> 29:57.796
In the present, not the past.

29:57.796 --> 29:59.423
But I'm gonna fix it.

30:20.152 --> 30:22.112
Did, uh...

30:24.281 --> 30:27.993
Did you hang the picture...

30:27.993 --> 30:30.662
in the dining room?

30:30.662 --> 30:33.582
That's where it belongs, isn't it?

30:33.582 --> 30:35.667
I found it in the shed.

30:37.294 --> 30:38.295
Remember this?

30:47.220 --> 30:49.014
Who bought it?

30:51.683 --> 30:52.726
You don't know?

30:54.352 --> 30:57.022
I want to know if you know.

31:01.568 --> 31:02.819
Your husband.

31:02.819 --> 31:05.530
They played it at your wedding.

31:38.980 --> 31:42.400
Upstairs.
The old safe.

31:45.362 --> 31:47.489
What's the combination?

31:51.743 --> 31:53.954
Your birthday.

32:02.212 --> 32:04.381
Oh, I...

32:04.381 --> 32:07.634
I feel light... in the head.

32:10.053 --> 32:13.682
Would you make me something to eat?

32:24.609 --> 32:26.903
Grandma, what's he doing here?

32:29.197 --> 32:32.075
When was the last time
I bought you a present?

32:32.075 --> 32:34.536
I want you to walk down the hill,

32:34.536 --> 32:37.164
take a taxi to the mall
in Chester's Mill,

32:37.164 --> 32:39.416
and let's make up for lost time.

32:39.416 --> 32:41.835
I don't think I should leave you
alone with that dude.

32:41.835 --> 32:44.462
I'm your grandmother.
I don't need a baby-sitter.

32:46.423 --> 32:47.883
Go on.

32:56.641 --> 32:59.019
Go on.

32:59.019 --> 33:01.605
<i>Front door open.</i>

33:11.698 --> 33:13.408
Where did the boy go?

33:16.119 --> 33:18.038
Oh...

33:18.038 --> 33:20.957
he must be around here someplace.

33:20.957 --> 33:23.501
He went out the front door.
You were just talking to him.

33:25.170 --> 33:26.630
Was I?

33:29.257 --> 33:31.259
Why don't you lie down?

33:31.259 --> 33:33.553
If you feel light-headed.

33:33.553 --> 33:35.055
Good idea.

33:35.055 --> 33:36.765
On the sofa.

33:36.765 --> 33:39.726
I think it's best if you stay
where I can see you,

33:39.726 --> 33:41.353
given your condition.

34:11.549 --> 34:13.426
You're gonna make it.

34:13.426 --> 34:15.679
Although you should be sick...

34:15.679 --> 34:18.348
Out in the rain with no jacket or shoes on.

34:18.348 --> 34:23.143
It's 98.9.
That's a fever, right?

34:23.143 --> 34:25.730
Quiz or essay?

34:25.730 --> 34:27.857
I've been a teacher long enough to know

34:27.857 --> 34:29.650
what playin' hooky looks like.

34:32.696 --> 34:36.824
Can you just...
tell him I need to rest?

34:38.034 --> 34:39.536
Your father?

34:40.578 --> 34:42.956
He loves you, Henry.

34:42.956 --> 34:44.666
He does.

34:45.917 --> 34:48.085
It's just...

34:48.085 --> 34:51.089
he was sick before
you came to live with us.

34:51.089 --> 34:54.092
He had headaches...

34:54.092 --> 34:55.927
he'd see things that weren't there.

34:55.927 --> 34:59.514
It's called glioma.
It's a growth in the brain.

34:59.514 --> 35:01.433
But... But God saved him.

35:02.892 --> 35:04.728
I know it's scary,
hearing your father

35:04.728 --> 35:08.023
talk about hurting himself,
but I'm gonna take him to Boston

35:08.023 --> 35:09.941
for another scan,
and he's gonna be just...

35:09.941 --> 35:12.944
No. He won't go.

35:14.362 --> 35:17.282
He says that
you think he's sick,

35:17.282 --> 35:19.075
but he's not.

35:19.075 --> 35:22.203
If he was, he could just...

35:22.203 --> 35:24.039
pray it away.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.836
What were you doing outside...

35:29.836 --> 35:31.755
in the rain with no shoes on?

35:35.550 --> 35:38.178
Did your father
send you out there?

35:38.178 --> 35:40.847
We OK?

35:46.978 --> 35:49.439
Fine, just, uh...

35:49.439 --> 35:51.691
Henry's got a fever.

35:54.569 --> 35:55.945
Is that right?

36:02.369 --> 36:04.537
Well, you better rest up, then.

36:13.713 --> 36:15.882
He was teaching me.

36:19.260 --> 36:21.680
Listen...

36:21.680 --> 36:24.516
just... just tell him you hear it.

36:24.516 --> 36:27.644
God's voice.
Or whatever.

36:27.644 --> 36:30.105
Just tell him
what he wants to hear.

36:30.105 --> 36:32.440
Mrs. Deaver.

36:32.440 --> 36:34.192
Sorry for the wait.

36:46.371 --> 36:48.164
Cute.

36:48.164 --> 36:51.292
But you know, lost pets
aren't really my department.

36:54.129 --> 36:57.298
Henry loves that dog.

36:57.298 --> 36:59.592
She's got no tags.

37:01.177 --> 37:03.471
Matthew couldn't stand the jingling.

37:06.391 --> 37:08.727
Is that really why you're here?

37:11.813 --> 37:15.734
I'm not sure if you want to talk
to your sheriff, or your...

37:18.862 --> 37:20.905
I don't know what I am.

37:24.743 --> 37:26.870
My friend.

37:26.870 --> 37:29.873
Well...

37:29.873 --> 37:31.916
you say he's never raised a hand,

37:31.916 --> 37:35.086
so there's no legal avenue.

37:36.588 --> 37:38.381
That's the badge talking.

37:43.303 --> 37:47.098
As a friend...

37:47.098 --> 37:49.225
I have some other ideas.

37:52.103 --> 37:54.606
How would that look?

37:54.606 --> 37:58.485
Minister's wife
takes up with widowed sheriff.

37:58.485 --> 38:02.113
No. Not in this town.

38:02.113 --> 38:04.365
Fuck this town.

38:05.533 --> 38:07.911
Pardon my language.

38:12.707 --> 38:15.543
You go buy yourself a road atlas.

38:15.543 --> 38:18.421
Put your finger down
wherever you like.

38:18.421 --> 38:21.549
Texas. Vancouver.

38:21.549 --> 38:24.010
We'll make a fresh start.

38:24.010 --> 38:27.889
- Alan, I can't leave.
- Matthew? You said yourself

38:27.889 --> 38:30.642
- he's not the man you married.
- No...

38:30.642 --> 38:32.852
I can't leave Henry.

38:34.187 --> 38:36.523
I don't want you
to leave your son.

38:36.523 --> 38:40.193
All you need to do
is pack a suitcase.

38:43.404 --> 38:45.240
Oh. Sorry, I didn't know...

38:45.240 --> 38:48.785
I was...
I was just leaving anyway.

38:48.785 --> 38:50.703
Thank you, Sheriff.

38:57.585 --> 39:00.296
<i>Did I ever tell you
about what happened to Puck?</i>

39:00.296 --> 39:02.799
<i>Matthew said she must
have run off.</i>

39:10.181 --> 39:12.976
<i>But I found a box of poison
in the trash.</i>

39:12.976 --> 39:15.103
<i>I always wondered...</i>

39:15.103 --> 39:16.521
What did he do?

39:31.578 --> 39:35.874
Puck!

39:35.874 --> 39:38.334
<i>I used to see
the turkey vultures</i>

39:38.334 --> 39:41.713
<i>wheeling around the sky
out back, over the woods,</i>

39:41.713 --> 39:43.882
<i>but I was too chickenshit
to go look.</i>

39:43.882 --> 39:45.967
<i>The thought of her
being picked apart,</i>

39:45.967 --> 39:47.260
<i>nobody to bury her...</i>

40:06.237 --> 40:08.364
<i>Over hard.</i>

40:08.364 --> 40:10.825
Isn't that how you like them?

40:15.330 --> 40:18.583
Thank you.

40:47.779 --> 40:50.031
I found these in the garbage.

40:51.699 --> 40:53.952
It's a sedative.

41:03.378 --> 41:06.130
God helps those
who help themselves.

41:29.654 --> 41:32.740
It's better this way.

41:32.740 --> 41:34.617
The two of us.

41:38.663 --> 41:40.957
When I was younger,

41:40.957 --> 41:44.669
every night after dinner
I had a ritual.

41:44.669 --> 41:46.796
Do you know what it was?

41:49.048 --> 41:51.009
You'd take a bath.

41:53.678 --> 41:56.723
Now, why in heaven
did I ever give that up?

41:58.349 --> 42:00.435
I could draw one for you.

42:02.562 --> 42:04.856
Would you?

42:04.856 --> 42:06.232
Mm-hmm.

42:55.573 --> 42:57.325
One.

43:01.454 --> 43:04.207
Twenty-two...

43:06.542 --> 43:07.627
Forty.

43:26.771 --> 43:29.816
<i>Ruth!</i>

43:29.816 --> 43:31.484
<i>Where'd you go?</i>

43:32.902 --> 43:34.320
<i>Ruth?</i>

43:37.198 --> 43:39.200
<i>Ruth, where'd you go?!</i>

43:42.161 --> 43:43.704
<i>Where'd you go, Ruth?</i>

43:53.005 --> 43:55.133
Ruth?

43:55.133 --> 43:56.759
Where'd you go?

43:58.553 --> 44:00.680
<i>Ruth!</i>

44:17.780 --> 44:19.907
<i>Ruth? Ruth?</i>

44:20.908 --> 44:21.909
<i>Ruth?</i>

44:22.952 --> 44:24.328
<i>Ruth?</i>

44:27.165 --> 44:30.459
<i>Ruth?
Where did you go?</i>

44:47.560 --> 44:50.229
Are you there?

45:08.206 --> 45:10.625
Who are you?

45:12.710 --> 45:15.129
I'm smaller than a teacup.

45:31.062 --> 45:34.732
You're still young.
You'll remarry.

46:08.099 --> 46:10.101
It was a lovely wedding.

46:31.163 --> 46:35.001
<i>I don't want you
to leave your son.</i>

46:35.001 --> 46:38.087
<i>All you need to do
is pack the suitcase.</i>

46:49.390 --> 46:50.558
No.

46:51.642 --> 46:53.769
Leave him.

46:53.769 --> 46:55.438
Just leave him.

47:04.405 --> 47:06.615
Please.

47:06.615 --> 47:08.909
Just leave him.

47:53.204 --> 47:55.122
Ruth?

48:06.717 --> 48:08.386
Alan.

48:09.553 --> 48:11.889
Who's in there?

48:11.889 --> 48:14.225
Is it me?

48:17.353 --> 48:19.522
I'm so sorry.

48:53.139 --> 48:55.641
Where in God's name
have you been?

48:55.641 --> 48:58.310
I woke up and you were gone.

48:58.310 --> 49:02.231
He's got a fever, Matthew.
You're gonna kill him out there.

49:02.231 --> 49:03.441
Let's go to bed, Ruth.

49:04.483 --> 49:06.402
This ends right now.

49:06.402 --> 49:09.071
Tomorrow morning I'm taking you
to see Dr. Vargas.

49:09.071 --> 49:10.948
Whatever you thought
you heard out there...

49:10.948 --> 49:12.992
Henry heard it too.

49:15.744 --> 49:16.954
Is <i>he</i> sick?

49:19.290 --> 49:22.293
He told you what you wanted to
hear because I told him to.

49:22.293 --> 49:24.295
If I'd known you were
gonna drag him out

49:24.295 --> 49:26.797
all hours of the night,
chasing God knows what...!

49:31.135 --> 49:32.428
Is that right?

49:33.762 --> 49:36.807
Do you know
what false witness is?

49:36.807 --> 49:38.684
"Yes," your mother told you
to lie to me,

49:38.684 --> 49:40.352
- or "Yes"...
- I heard it.

49:42.104 --> 49:43.272
Henry.

49:43.272 --> 49:45.357
- Good man.
- Henry.

49:45.357 --> 49:47.443
- Go to your room.
- Tell him the truth.

49:47.443 --> 49:49.361
It's not your job to protect me,

49:49.361 --> 49:50.988
it's my job to protect you!

49:50.988 --> 49:53.240
You'd hear it too if you
just knew how to listen.

49:53.240 --> 49:55.701
You killed the dog, didn't you?

49:55.701 --> 49:57.703
I know you did.

49:57.703 --> 49:59.330
I can put up with a lot,

49:59.330 --> 50:01.707
but I will not let you hurt Henry.

50:01.707 --> 50:04.376
I'm takin' him away.
Tonight.

50:05.419 --> 50:07.880
My bag is <i>packed.</i>

50:10.966 --> 50:12.760
No, you won't.

50:13.969 --> 50:16.138
You never do.

50:18.349 --> 50:21.852
- What are you talking about?
- Who's Dr. Vargas?

50:21.852 --> 50:23.771
What?

50:23.771 --> 50:26.649
"We'll go see Dr. Vargas.
Tomorrow." Who's Dr. Vargas?

50:28.484 --> 50:31.111
Somebody gave her carnations,
do you remember that?

50:31.111 --> 50:32.446
Do you remember that?

50:33.531 --> 50:36.867
She's... what do you call it?

50:36.867 --> 50:38.661
Neurologist. Neurologist?

50:38.661 --> 50:40.538
Yours, not mine.
And you can't leave

50:40.538 --> 50:42.206
because, see, 'cause you didn't.

50:45.125 --> 50:48.295
And you can't leave
because you didn't.

50:48.295 --> 50:52.174
You're sick, Matthew.
You've lost touch with reality.

50:52.174 --> 50:55.344
Says the woman that's arguing
with her dead husband.

50:57.263 --> 50:59.765
Why don't you just ask me
what you really want...

50:59.765 --> 51:02.685
Why don't you just ask me
what you really want to know?

51:04.186 --> 51:06.438
Where are the bullets?

51:06.438 --> 51:09.275
But I can't help you,
because I'm not me, I'm you.

51:09.275 --> 51:10.401
And you can't remember.

51:11.735 --> 51:13.571
I should have taken the gun

51:13.571 --> 51:15.614
and shot you in your sleep.

51:15.614 --> 51:18.409
- Why?
- To protect our son!

51:18.409 --> 51:20.703
It's a little late for that.
What'd you ever do for Henry?

51:20.703 --> 51:22.371
Nothing, because you were
too chickenshit.

51:22.371 --> 51:24.957
- I packed the bag!
- And you unpacked it.

51:24.957 --> 51:28.294
<i>Clothes back in the drawers,
gun back in the linen closet.</i>

51:32.006 --> 51:35.009
What?

51:37.344 --> 51:40.222
I packed... the bullets.

51:42.349 --> 51:45.227
I never unpacked 'em.

51:52.318 --> 51:54.236
Oh!

52:30.522 --> 52:31.940
Ahh!

52:48.374 --> 52:51.960
<i>Do you know
what false witness is?</i>

52:51.960 --> 52:55.422
<i>He was Paul...
He was Paul, he wasn't Saul.</i>

52:55.422 --> 52:59.051
<i>Because your life belongs
to God... belongs to God...</i>

52:59.051 --> 53:01.053
<i>Before you tell me
it's irresponsible,</i>

53:01.053 --> 53:02.179
<i>the bullets are locked away.</i>

53:02.179 --> 53:03.305
<i>He'll never find them.</i>

53:03.305 --> 53:05.140
<i>The bullets are locked away...</i>

53:05.140 --> 53:10.020
<i>But I can't help you
because I'm not me...</i>

53:10.020 --> 53:11.939
<i>it wasn't ringing...
a beautiful experience...</i>

53:11.939 --> 53:15.150
<i>hear it too if you just
knew how to listen, listen...</i>

53:15.150 --> 53:17.486
<i>What'd you ever do
for Henry? Nothing.</i>

53:17.486 --> 53:19.530
<i>'Cause you were too chickenshit!</i>

56:28.468 --> 56:30.387
Ruth.

56:30.387 --> 56:33.599
Hi. It's me, Alan.

56:33.599 --> 56:37.686
I've been back
from New Hampshire a few months.

56:37.686 --> 56:40.063
Maybe you knew that.

56:40.063 --> 56:42.399
Uh...

56:42.399 --> 56:44.776
so, Del Bonsant called,

56:44.776 --> 56:48.447
he said he heard gunshots
up on North Prospect.

56:48.447 --> 56:50.365
I could be dead in the ground,

56:50.365 --> 56:52.993
folks would still ring me
when they need a policeman.

56:52.993 --> 56:56.913
So I figured that, uh,

56:56.913 --> 57:00.125
I'd check and see
if you needed one.

57:01.543 --> 57:03.170
A cop.

57:08.592 --> 57:10.719
Ruth.

57:10.719 --> 57:12.804
It's 'cause of you.

57:18.477 --> 57:20.646
That's why I came back.

57:21.688 --> 57:24.107
I... I know it's not fair

57:24.107 --> 57:27.027
to put this on you
after all these years,

57:27.027 --> 57:29.529
and if you want me to,
I'll go right now.

57:29.529 --> 57:32.949
No. Please.

57:32.949 --> 57:34.826
Don't leave.

57:35.869 --> 57:37.871
Please don't leave.

57:41.958 --> 57:44.086
I'm not goin' anywhere.
