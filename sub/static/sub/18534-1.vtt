WOMAN 1: (ON TV) <i>And by the way,
honey, with all this decolletage</i>

05:29.849 --> 05:33.203
<i>you should be getting a lot more
dickoletage than what he has to offer.</i>

05:33.238 --> 05:35.027
<i>And as I can recall it,</i>

05:35.062 --> 05:36.913
<i>you were the one that
told me that when he came,</i>

05:36.937 --> 05:38.876
<i>it was as thin as coconut water.</i>

05:38.911 --> 05:40.580
<i>Honey, that's a deal breaker for me.</i>

05:40.629 --> 05:41.712
WOMAN 2: (ON TV) <i>It was that thin.</i>

05:41.736 --> 05:44.180
WOMAN 1: <i>Well, I see we're
settling for less nowadays.</i>

05:44.215 --> 05:46.452
(BOTH LAUGHING)

05:47.553 --> 05:48.988
That's beyond.

05:53.785 --> 05:55.741
CHRISTOPHER: Mrs. Morrow,
a package arrived for you.

05:55.765 --> 05:57.698
I found it in the mailbox this morning.

05:57.771 --> 06:00.563
May I ask you who you'd
like on duty this weekend?

06:00.598 --> 06:03.501
Um, actually, why don't you
give everybody the weekend off?

06:03.564 --> 06:04.676
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah.

06:04.700 --> 06:06.669
We might go to the beach house and, uh,

06:06.760 --> 06:08.971
if not, it might be nice
to have a weekend alone.

06:09.527 --> 06:11.567
- I'll let everyone know.
- Thank you.

06:15.787 --> 06:17.208
Oh, damn it.

06:18.109 --> 06:19.332
- Christopher?
- CHRISTOPHER: Yes?

06:19.356 --> 06:22.053
I'm sorry. Can you help me open
this? I just got a paper cut.

06:22.113 --> 06:24.417
- Yeah, of course. Here, let me do it.
- Thank you.

06:24.688 --> 06:27.091
Yeah, yeah. I just... A paper cut.

06:32.030 --> 06:34.458
- There's a note.
- You can read it.

06:35.469 --> 06:36.400
_

06:36.435 --> 06:39.040
"Dear Susan, I've written a novel
that will be published in the spring.

06:39.064 --> 06:40.663
"It's different from the kind
of things that I was writing

06:40.687 --> 06:42.273
"when we were together."

06:44.834 --> 06:45.834
Go ahead.

06:46.798 --> 06:48.423
"In the end you left me with
the inspiration that I needed

06:48.447 --> 06:49.830
"to write from the heart.

06:49.894 --> 06:52.798
"I wanted you to be the first to
read it, so I'm sending along a proof.

06:52.852 --> 06:54.572
"I will be in LA until
Wednesday on business

06:54.611 --> 06:56.870
"and it would be good
to see you after so long.

06:56.950 --> 06:59.931
"My cell number and email
address are below. Edward."

07:02.152 --> 07:03.152
Thanks.

07:14.792 --> 07:16.565
- Morning.
- Good morning.

07:17.910 --> 07:21.039
- What's that?
- It's a manuscript Edward sent me.

07:21.093 --> 07:22.445
He wrote a novel.

07:23.082 --> 07:24.310
Edward who?

07:24.860 --> 07:27.444
Edward, my first husband. You remember him.

07:27.518 --> 07:29.310
I didn't know he could write.

07:29.380 --> 07:31.842
Yes, you did. He was writing a
novel when you and I got together.

07:31.866 --> 07:33.401
You just don't remember.

07:33.645 --> 07:35.812
Have you guys even talked in 20 years?

07:36.479 --> 07:37.833
19.

07:38.361 --> 07:42.879
No. I tried calling him a couple
of years back, but he hung up on me.

07:43.294 --> 07:46.398
I think he's teaching English
at some prep school in Dallas.

07:46.511 --> 07:48.400
It's sad, really. He never remarried.

07:49.828 --> 07:52.385
Where were you last night?
You didn't come by the gallery.

07:54.845 --> 07:56.581
I'm sorry. Really, I...

07:56.616 --> 07:58.604
By the time I left the office,
I was late for my dinner and...

07:58.628 --> 08:00.997
It would have taken you 15 minutes.

08:01.083 --> 08:03.219
Fifteen minutes, and it
would have meant a lot to me.

08:04.657 --> 08:05.994
Never mind.

08:07.790 --> 08:10.527
- You didn't come to bed last night.
- I didn't wanna wake you.

08:11.594 --> 08:12.642
Yeah.

08:13.724 --> 08:18.639
Well, I wasn't asleep. I was
too wound up from the opening.

08:19.741 --> 08:22.559
It went well, by the way. Apparently.

08:22.885 --> 08:24.355
- Good.
- Yeah.

08:27.444 --> 08:30.547
Look, why don't you and I go to the beach?

08:30.904 --> 08:33.784
We can go tonight and come back on Monday.

08:34.957 --> 08:37.894
Maybe if we just spent some
time, just the two of us?

08:43.405 --> 08:46.307
Why are you wearing this
blazer on a Saturday?

08:47.314 --> 08:49.621
Because I gotta go back to the office,

08:49.669 --> 08:53.072
and then I gotta go to the airport,
and then I gotta go back to New York.

08:53.107 --> 08:55.545
- You just came from there.
- Yes, I know.

08:55.580 --> 08:58.515
But I have to go again if
I wanna get this deal done,

08:58.550 --> 09:00.670
and I don't wanna have
to sell anything else.

09:00.750 --> 09:02.586
- Shit.
- It's okay.

09:06.290 --> 09:08.552
You know, the strange thing is is,

09:08.818 --> 09:11.066
I don't really care about all this art.

09:13.288 --> 09:16.626
- That doesn't sound like you.
- I know, but it's true.

09:18.420 --> 09:19.472
I care.

09:20.330 --> 09:21.865
It pisses me off.

09:23.207 --> 09:24.587
I know you do.

09:25.550 --> 09:28.365
Don't worry, I can fill the
walls with some new LA artists

09:28.430 --> 09:31.986
and people will think we're ahead
of the curve instead of going broke.

09:32.048 --> 09:33.657
You won't have to be embarrassed.

09:48.744 --> 09:50.151
Are things a little better?

09:50.209 --> 09:52.700
He's just having a hard time
with his business right now.

09:52.757 --> 09:54.580
Carlos told me.

09:54.690 --> 09:57.376
I'm surprised. I thought we
were hiding it pretty well.

09:58.095 --> 10:00.221
Hutton would be very upset
to find out anybody knew.

10:00.276 --> 10:02.811
He just hates not to win.

10:02.892 --> 10:04.280
Are you sleeping?

10:05.382 --> 10:07.945
Did you call my psychopharmacologist?
Did you call him?

10:07.980 --> 10:10.034
You should call him, because he's a genius.

10:10.876 --> 10:13.057
I'm worried about you, seriously.

10:13.150 --> 10:15.339
Just look at me for a second. Look at me.

10:17.333 --> 10:19.961
You scared me the last time we talked.

10:20.036 --> 10:21.466
I'm fine.

10:21.550 --> 10:24.267
I am fine. I am...

10:24.533 --> 10:28.225
I am. I just can't believe that
I told you all of those things.

10:28.305 --> 10:31.262
I'm just kind of embarrassed, you know.

10:31.493 --> 10:35.397
Because what right do I have to
not be happy? I have everything.

10:35.670 --> 10:38.101
I feel ungrateful not to be happy.

10:38.187 --> 10:40.292
As much right as anyone,
Susan, as much right as anyone,

10:40.316 --> 10:42.052
because it's all relative.

10:45.382 --> 10:49.520
You're just awfully hard on yourself.

10:50.678 --> 10:51.893
How do you do it?

10:53.439 --> 10:56.802
You mean with Carlos? I just...
It's... I'm totally cool with it.

10:56.873 --> 11:00.595
And having a gay husband is
not such a bad thing, you know?

11:02.867 --> 11:06.663
We're best friends. We
love each other completely.

11:06.698 --> 11:08.936
I'm certainly the only woman in his life.

11:09.002 --> 11:12.012
And that lasts longer
than lust, doesn't it?

11:12.066 --> 11:13.756
It's forever, really.

11:14.637 --> 11:16.388
Hutton and I don't have that.

11:16.439 --> 11:17.864
Did you ever?

11:18.794 --> 11:21.824
I think we just want different
things, or I want different things.

11:24.360 --> 11:25.866
ALESSIA: Do you still love him?

11:30.368 --> 11:32.080
I'm being summoned. Pardon me.

11:32.129 --> 11:34.103
He has to catch a plane.
I'm gonna say goodbye.

11:40.753 --> 11:42.780
I hope this deal works out for you.

11:43.100 --> 11:46.147
- I really do. I know you need it.
- We need this.

11:46.369 --> 11:48.768
No. You need this.

11:53.277 --> 11:54.478
- Bye.
- Bye.

12:04.228 --> 12:05.054
CHLOE: <i>So I said,</i>

"Well, my mother always told me

12:07.157 --> 12:10.221

12:15.765 --> 12:17.501
I've gotta get some Pam.

12:19.066 --> 12:21.631
And she is going to get
a nomination this year.

12:21.672 --> 12:23.692
A nomination? She's gonna win.

12:25.809 --> 12:28.097
Let's talk about your opening.

12:28.203 --> 12:31.463
- My favorite subject.
- Not mine.

12:31.552 --> 12:35.552
The opening was spectacular last night.

12:35.587 --> 12:37.348
Really? That's what you thought?

12:37.422 --> 12:39.048
- What, you didn't?
- No.

12:39.109 --> 12:41.530
I thought the work was incredibly strong.

12:41.622 --> 12:45.563
So perfect with all this
junk culture that we live in.

12:45.595 --> 12:48.431
It's junk. It is junk.

12:48.523 --> 12:51.101
Total junk.

12:51.134 --> 12:55.374
Darling, you are a big success.

12:55.484 --> 13:00.396
- No one really likes what they do.
- Then why do we do it?

13:00.431 --> 13:01.905
Because we're driven.

13:03.412 --> 13:05.181
Maybe a bit insecure.

13:06.816 --> 13:09.672
We get into things when we're young

13:09.725 --> 13:12.906
and because we think they mean something.

13:12.963 --> 13:14.948
SUSAN: And then we find
out that they don't.

13:17.500 --> 13:22.505
Oh, Susan, enjoy the
absurdity of our world.

13:22.666 --> 13:24.470
It's a lot less painful.

13:24.927 --> 13:30.628
And believe me, our world is a lot
less painful than the real world.

14:00.495 --> 14:01.882

14:22.445 --> 14:25.074
Yeah, why are we driving
this old thing to Marfa?

14:25.149 --> 14:28.455
Because I just had it completely
rebuilt. It's a classic.

14:28.531 --> 14:30.609
It has a terrible sound system.

14:30.673 --> 14:32.672
Well, you're gonna have
to suffer through that.

14:32.788 --> 14:34.631
You have two sets of boots, India?

14:34.691 --> 14:37.622
Do we really have to stop
tonight? I'd rather just get there.

14:37.761 --> 14:39.861
All right, ask your mother. She's the boss.

14:43.086 --> 14:44.607
I set the alarm.

- TONY: All right, sweetheart. It's all right.

20:56.670 --> 21:00.135
You know, please just get back in
your car now and leave us alone.

21:00.196 --> 21:02.542
Calm down. We got an accident
to report, that's all.

21:02.589 --> 21:05.773
- TURK: Calm down. Hey, lady, lady, lady.
- It's a flashlight, sweetheart.

21:05.855 --> 21:08.079
It's just a flashlight. It's all right.

21:08.838 --> 21:12.743
- Jesus Christ.
- Okay, so let's exchange information.

21:12.864 --> 21:14.380
- Information?
- Yeah.

21:14.434 --> 21:16.603
- Let's exchange information.
- Get it out of the glove compartment.

21:16.627 --> 21:19.842
Okay, I'm a Gemini. My
favorite color's pale pink.

21:19.903 --> 21:22.307
I like long walks and kittens.

21:27.843 --> 21:29.506
(IMITATES KITTEN MEWING)

21:29.541 --> 21:31.377
(LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY)

21:36.364 --> 21:39.432
We should... You know what?
We should call the police.

21:39.507 --> 21:42.382
- Oh, oh? Really?
- Yeah. Yeah.

21:42.417 --> 21:43.806
RAY: That's a great idea.

21:43.841 --> 21:45.896
- It was your fucking fault, right?
- What?

21:45.968 --> 21:48.578
It doesn't matter whose
fault it was. Let's get going.

21:48.652 --> 21:50.135
TURK: Hey, Ray, these
guys have got a flat tire.

21:50.159 --> 21:52.574
- LOU: They sure do.
- Well, what do you know?

21:52.711 --> 21:55.292
- What'd he say?
- Don't believe it, Dad.

21:56.264 --> 21:58.126
- LAURA: He said we had a flat tire.
- TONY: What did he say?

21:58.150 --> 21:59.990
INDIA: Don't believe
him. We don't have a flat.

22:04.391 --> 22:05.588
- LAURA: What?
- What?

22:05.688 --> 22:08.393
Yep, your left tire's flat. It sure is.

22:09.572 --> 22:12.039
Must have bust it when you
were shoving us off the road.

22:12.096 --> 22:15.006
We did not shove you off the
road. You shoved us off the road.

22:15.059 --> 22:17.941
- INDIA: It's a lie.
- You think I'm a liar?

22:18.099 --> 22:19.335
It's okay. It's okay.

22:19.414 --> 22:21.537
- She's just a child.
- You think I'm a liar?

22:21.598 --> 22:24.786
No, she's not saying that,
man. She's just a child.

22:26.740 --> 22:30.591
You don't got a flat, go on, drive.

22:31.270 --> 22:34.292
- Start the engine and drive.
- Please drive. Just drive.

22:34.364 --> 22:37.653
TURK: Just drive on it, asshole.
Nobody's stopping you. Drive away.

22:37.700 --> 22:39.475
Go. Fuck off.

22:39.510 --> 22:41.180
Stupid motherfucker.

22:41.479 --> 22:45.161
- Shit. God damn it!
- LAURA: Oh, God. Oh, God.

22:45.322 --> 22:47.363
- Oh, God.
- It's okay. It's all right.

22:47.554 --> 22:49.836
LAURA: It's not okay. We're
in the middle of nowhere.

22:49.918 --> 22:52.439
What are we gonna do,
Tony? What are we gonna do?

22:52.553 --> 22:54.195
What are we gonna do, Tony?

22:54.990 --> 22:56.094
RAY: I tell you what.

22:57.906 --> 22:59.608
We'll fix it for you, won't we, guys?

22:59.716 --> 23:01.060
Yeah, sure.

23:03.809 --> 23:04.736
- LAURA: Really?
- Yeah.

23:04.808 --> 23:06.863
Just to show you we're
okay, we'll fix it for you.

23:06.944 --> 23:08.546
You won't have to do a thing.

23:08.634 --> 23:11.129
Then we'll go to the cops together, right?

23:11.195 --> 23:13.815
- You and me, report your accident.
- TONY: All right.

23:13.868 --> 23:15.080
- Thank you.
- Sound good?

23:15.147 --> 23:16.226
- Yeah.
- LAURA: Thank you.

23:16.258 --> 23:17.773
- TURK: You got tools, mister?
- TONY: Um, I actually, I...

23:17.797 --> 23:19.865
No need. Use ours. Come
on, let's get going.

23:20.979 --> 23:22.192
TONY: No, it's fine, it's just fine.

23:22.216 --> 23:25.934
I can't fix a tire, so I
can't... I need their help.

23:25.969 --> 23:28.237
LAURA: Please don't make
eye contact with them.

23:38.648 --> 23:40.232
TURK: You got a spare tire, man?

23:42.645 --> 23:44.502
Can't change a tire without a spare.

23:46.113 --> 23:47.705
TURK: You wanna give me
the keys to the trunk?

23:47.729 --> 23:49.843
- No, don't.
- Who the fuck do you think you are?

23:51.119 --> 23:52.716
Just pop the trunk, honey.

23:54.398 --> 23:55.638
I got it.

23:56.637 --> 23:58.540
That's all right, I got that. That's fine.

23:58.811 --> 24:01.118
It's right underneath here. There you go.

24:01.226 --> 24:02.595
Just right under there.

24:03.451 --> 24:05.323
Just got a lot of things in here.

24:10.982 --> 24:12.738
It's just right under there.

24:13.796 --> 24:16.291
- Sorry.
- TURK: Get the women out of the car.

24:16.604 --> 24:17.686
Come on, get 'em out.

24:20.289 --> 24:21.715
Come on, man.

24:21.862 --> 24:24.131
Gotta lift your car up on
the jack, so get 'em out.

24:28.432 --> 24:32.067
Dude. Has he gotta lift your
wife and your child and the car?

24:32.112 --> 24:33.903
- Right, right.
- Get your women out the car.

24:33.967 --> 24:36.926
It's all right, honey. Just get out
of the car. They need to fix the car.

24:38.040 --> 24:40.042
They're fine. They're just fixing the tire.

24:45.180 --> 24:46.180
RAY: Come over here.

24:47.609 --> 24:50.501
Come on, here. Have you
seen what you did to my car?

24:51.782 --> 24:54.822
- You think you're fucking hot shit, don't you?
- What are you talking about?

24:55.629 --> 24:57.891
They definitely think
they're fucking hot shit.

24:58.062 --> 24:59.169
- Who?
- Are you serious?

24:59.241 --> 25:01.567
- Your bitches, man. Who else?
- TONY: Look...

25:01.669 --> 25:05.194
No, you think you're so special, you
can just bump another guy's car...

25:05.258 --> 25:09.545
No, we were just trying to get... You
were playing some kind of crazy game.

25:09.992 --> 25:12.908

25:27.356 --> 25:29.073
RAY: There goes your cops.

25:30.658 --> 25:32.463
You should have tried harder to stop 'em.

25:33.315 --> 25:36.085
That's okay. It's okay.
We'll take good care of you.

25:39.340 --> 25:42.053
Fucking bitch. Uppity rich bitch.

25:42.143 --> 25:44.133
I'll teach you a fucking thing or two.

25:46.843 --> 25:47.844
It's okay.

25:52.762 --> 25:54.865
What? What you looking at?

25:55.150 --> 25:56.692
- Hotshot.
- What do you mean?

25:56.749 --> 25:58.869
RAY: What are you trying to
do there on the road, huh?

25:59.241 --> 26:02.044
What? I... What are you talking about?

26:02.632 --> 26:04.394
Look, look, look...

26:05.273 --> 26:10.557
We... We are... We are just trying
to get where... Where we are going.

26:10.652 --> 26:11.754
RAY: Where's that?

26:13.889 --> 26:15.843
- I said where you going?
- To Marfa.

26:15.951 --> 26:17.757
What exactly is in Marfa?

26:19.308 --> 26:20.509
- Hey, motherfucker...
- Hey!

26:20.573 --> 26:22.841
- INDIA: Leave my dad alone, asshole!
- Leave me alone, man.

26:22.865 --> 26:23.426
Fuck you, baby.

26:23.480 --> 26:24.922
She didn't mean that. She's just a kid.

26:24.946 --> 26:26.042
RAY: Your daddy won't
tell me, so why don't you?

26:26.066 --> 26:29.087
INDIA: Let me go! What's it to you anyway?

26:29.122 --> 26:31.489
- RAY: Look, we're nice guys.
- LAURA: Don't touch my daughter!

26:31.513 --> 26:33.440

get to where we're going.

26:35.554 --> 26:37.827
You wanna dance? Wanna dance?

26:37.960 --> 26:39.577
Oh, is that it? That all?

26:39.612 --> 26:42.839
Baby, look at your daddy. He thinks
he's so much better than me, huh?

26:42.907 --> 26:44.284
What do you think? What do you think?

26:44.308 --> 26:46.934
- Well, he is.
- I mean, seriously, look at him.

26:47.028 --> 26:48.145
Let her go!

26:49.110 --> 26:50.833
You're scum, you know!

27:01.691 --> 27:04.005
You got no fucking right
talking to me like that.

27:04.636 --> 27:08.164

there? Need a tissue?

27:20.205 --> 27:22.754
God damn, that looks bad. You might need...

27:22.789 --> 27:25.106

- Hey, honey, you got a tampon?

27:25.200 --> 27:27.244

- Yeah.

27:39.687 --> 27:42.170
How far up the road
till we can get a signal?

27:42.324 --> 27:43.894
Why do you wanna get further up the road?

27:43.918 --> 27:45.821
So you can leave the
scene of an accident again?

27:45.900 --> 27:47.458
INDIA: Leave him alone.

27:51.839 --> 27:54.264
- There's service up by Bailey.
- All right.

27:54.370 --> 27:56.210
How do you think we're
gonna get there, though?

27:56.279 --> 27:58.408

- Which car?

27:58.511 --> 27:59.802
In both cars.

27:59.900 --> 28:02.522
- Mister, don't try no fucking shit with me.

You heard me. I know what you're
doing. I know what your plan is.

28:11.520 --> 28:15.242
RAY: How do I know you ain't just gonna
floor the gas and leave me in the dust?

28:15.357 --> 28:17.673
You get in your car and we'll get
in ours and we'll follow you there.

28:17.697 --> 28:20.254

Lou can drive your car.

28:22.789 --> 28:24.792
No, I'm not gonna do that. No.

She the boss? Is she
the boss of your family?

29:12.582 --> 29:15.091

- Have you got a vagina?

29:15.142 --> 29:17.045
Have you got a fucking vagina there?

29:17.592 --> 29:18.592
Hey!

29:18.653 --> 29:19.452
- TONY: Laura!

I'm just walking in the door of the hotel.

30:22.035 --> 30:24.179
- What floor, sir?
- 31, please.

30:24.214 --> 30:25.808
That's not our usual floor.

30:27.523 --> 30:29.976
No, our regular room wasn't available.

52:15.069 --> 52:16.205
just like you thought.

52:18.258 --> 52:19.212
How do you know that?

52:19.279 --> 52:22.255
We found your wife's
fingerprints on the bedpost.

52:23.530 --> 52:25.927
- Whose trailer is it?
- It's clear.

52:26.480 --> 52:29.223
Guy doesn't even live
here. He's in El Paso.

52:29.303 --> 52:32.000
Trailer's been broken into.
Somebody's been living in it.

52:32.081 --> 52:33.439
There's prints all over the place.

52:33.463 --> 52:35.259
We're gonna have to check
'em against the owner's,

52:35.283 --> 52:37.085
see if we can separate 'em out.

52:37.179 --> 52:38.133
- Right.
- I'm hopeful, though.

52:38.201 --> 52:41.033
The owner hasn't been
there since last fall, so...

52:42.669 --> 52:44.157
Looks promising.

52:48.248 --> 52:49.450

52:51.618 --> 52:52.891

tell me this before?</i>

53:07.587 --> 53:10.100
<i>You're actually
gonna leave New York,</i>

53:10.254 --> 53:13.760
move to Austin and go to the
goddamn University of Texas?

53:14.881 --> 53:16.157
Why are you doing this?

53:16.985 --> 53:18.454
I mean, where is this gonna go?

53:18.573 --> 53:19.849
What do you mean, where
is this going to go?

53:19.873 --> 53:22.455
I'm going to marry Edward.
That's where this is going to go.

53:22.490 --> 53:24.421
This is a ridiculous conversation.

53:25.098 --> 53:26.879
You're too young to get married.

53:27.582 --> 53:28.864
Really?

53:29.189 --> 53:32.810
Mom, last summer you tried to
convince me that I had to marry Bass.

53:32.887 --> 53:34.822
That is different.

53:35.422 --> 53:37.366
Bass is your equal.

53:37.401 --> 53:40.430
Oh, my God. Did you just say
that? You really just said that.

53:40.518 --> 53:42.721
That came out of your mouth. That's...

53:44.671 --> 53:47.002
Why do you always think the worst of me?

53:49.563 --> 53:51.592
That is not what I meant.

53:52.017 --> 53:57.486
What I meant is that you
are very strong-willed,

53:57.581 --> 54:00.584
and Edward, as sweet as he
is, he's too weak for you.

54:00.767 --> 54:03.895
Weak is not a word that I
would use to describe Edward.

54:03.987 --> 54:05.468
Sensitive is a word that I would use,

54:05.561 --> 54:08.776
which isn't a word I would use to
describe anyone else in this family,

54:08.824 --> 54:09.918
except maybe Cooper.

54:09.974 --> 54:11.876
Don't bring Cooper into this.

54:12.670 --> 54:13.670
Sorry.

54:15.032 --> 54:16.930
Come on, Susan.

54:17.968 --> 54:20.515

care about the same things,

54:20.589 --> 54:22.032
but you're wrong.

In a few years, all these bourgeois
things, as you so like to call them,

54:25.586 --> 54:27.593
are gonna be very important to you,

54:27.657 --> 54:29.811
and Edward's not gonna be
able to give them to you.

54:31.608 --> 54:32.973
He has no money.

54:35.465 --> 54:37.602
He's not driven. He's not ambitious.

54:38.661 --> 54:40.567
And I can promise you, if you marry Edward,

54:40.644 --> 54:42.660
your father's not gonna
give them to you either.

54:43.339 --> 54:45.558
No, you're right. He's not driven

54:45.660 --> 54:47.544
the way that you would like him to be.

54:48.479 --> 54:50.396
But he is strong.

54:50.431 --> 54:52.800
He's stronger than I am in a lot of ways.

54:52.909 --> 54:56.546
Just... He just has a different
kind of strength is all.

54:56.581 --> 54:58.652
"A different kind of strength."

54:58.687 --> 55:01.123
And what kind of strength is that?

55:01.211 --> 55:05.171
He has the strength to believe in himself

55:05.963 --> 55:07.293
and believe in me.

55:08.892 --> 55:09.983
Susan,

55:11.161 --> 55:12.963
keep seeing him if you have to,

55:13.090 --> 55:14.210
live with him, I don't care,

55:14.261 --> 55:16.009
but do not marry him.

55:16.859 --> 55:21.002
(STAMMERING) I understand what
you see in Edward. I get it.

55:21.037 --> 55:22.749
- No.
- No, wait, I do.

55:22.878 --> 55:24.847
- No, you don't. No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

55:24.902 --> 55:26.837
He is a romantic.

55:28.047 --> 55:30.232

55:34.349 --> 55:35.474
Don't...

55:36.940 --> 55:38.441
Don't do this.

55:40.310 --> 55:41.770
You'll regret it.

55:43.065 --> 55:45.539
And you'll only hurt Edward in the end.

now are the things you'll hate

Animals</i> and he dedicated it to me.

01:05:07.364 --> 01:05:08.587
Did you love him?

01:05:08.678 --> 01:05:10.114
Yeah, I loved him.

01:05:11.395 --> 01:05:15.487
He was a writer and, uh,
I didn't have faith in him.

01:05:16.545 --> 01:05:18.704
I panicked and I did
something horrible to him.

01:05:18.768 --> 01:05:21.210
Something unforgivable, really.

01:05:21.964 --> 01:05:24.267
- You left him?
- I left him.

01:05:25.641 --> 01:05:28.485
I left him in a brutal way,

01:05:29.258 --> 01:05:31.764
for the handsome and dashing Hutton.

01:05:31.851 --> 01:05:34.184
- Who is very handsome and dashing.
- ...and dashing. Yes.

01:05:34.219 --> 01:05:36.122
(LAUGHS)

01:05:36.233 --> 01:05:38.238
Do you ever feel like your
life has turned into something

01:05:38.262 --> 01:05:39.581
you never intended?

01:05:46.995 --> 01:05:47.995
No.

01:05:48.979 --> 01:05:51.062
Of course not. You just
started living your life.

01:05:53.611 --> 01:05:55.698
You really didn't get any sleep, did you?

01:05:59.381 --> 01:06:00.383
No.

01:06:02.772 --> 01:06:03.773

01:06:50.046 --> 01:06:51.686
SUSAN: Where did this painting come from?

01:06:52.302 --> 01:06:53.527
What do you mean, where did it come from?

01:06:53.551 --> 01:06:55.205
You bought it for us, remember?

01:06:55.306 --> 01:06:57.309
It was part of the series
like eight years ago.

01:06:57.461 --> 01:06:59.293
- It's great, isn't it?
- Yeah.

01:06:59.396 --> 01:07:01.832
- (BABY COOING FROM PHONE)
- What is that?

01:07:01.984 --> 01:07:03.867
Oh, my God, it's so cool.

01:07:03.922 --> 01:07:07.493
It's this app that lets me watch
Willow while she's in her crib.

01:07:07.770 --> 01:07:10.574
Really? Do you not trust your nanny?

01:07:10.633 --> 01:07:12.735
No, no, I do. I just hate her, so...

01:07:12.770 --> 01:07:13.868
And I would like to be more involved

01:07:13.892 --> 01:07:15.699
with Willow throughout the day, so...

01:07:16.425 --> 01:07:18.973
Look. There she is.

01:07:19.254 --> 01:07:21.975
And the sound's incredible. You
can actually hear her breathing.

01:07:22.010 --> 01:07:23.487
And I can talk to her if I want to.

01:07:25.893 --> 01:07:29.910
(GASPS) I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm...

01:07:29.945 --> 01:07:31.829
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:07:32.071 --> 01:07:33.406
Yeah, I just...

01:07:34.718 --> 01:07:36.080
I thought I saw someone.

01:07:39.026 --> 01:07:40.200
Well, you did see someone.

01:07:40.262 --> 01:07:41.935
That's Willow and she's in her crib.

01:07:41.982 --> 01:07:43.252
She's sleeping.

01:07:43.335 --> 01:07:46.725
I'm really sorry about
your phone. I can, um...

01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:49.099
It's fine. A new one comes
out next week anyway, so...

01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:50.162
Thanks.

01:07:50.740 --> 01:07:52.168
(INHALES SHARPLY) Shall we?

01:07:53.643 --> 01:07:54.893
They're all waiting for us.

01:07:58.293 --> 01:08:02.464
SAGE: We're under no contractual
obligations. Which is good.

01:08:02.499 --> 01:08:04.900
I know we all have different,
you know, opinions about this,

01:08:04.947 --> 01:08:06.544
but as far as I'm concerned...

01:08:16.419 --> 01:08:18.488
Anyways, I think we should cut her loose.

01:08:18.550 --> 01:08:20.510
She isn't who she sold herself
to be when we hired her.

01:08:20.533 --> 01:08:22.718
LINDA: I disagree. I think
we should keep her for now.

01:08:22.752 --> 01:08:25.352
- SAGE: Why is that?
- LINDA: Because she's great and we all like her.

01:08:25.376 --> 01:08:28.011
She just needs our support and
a little bit of time, that's all.

01:08:28.099 --> 01:08:30.569
SAMANTHA: But it's not
working. We need to fire her.

01:08:30.643 --> 01:08:32.823
There's an awesome candidate that
we could steal from the Hammer

01:08:32.846 --> 01:08:34.585
if we move fast.

01:08:34.643 --> 01:08:38.296
I agree with Linda. We hired
her. We should support her.

01:08:38.814 --> 01:08:39.885
New doctor?

01:08:42.318 --> 01:08:44.285
No. New haircut.

01:08:45.740 --> 01:08:47.920
SAGE: But, Susan, you were the
one who brought it up last meeting

01:08:47.944 --> 01:08:50.035
that you were looking for a change.

01:08:50.072 --> 01:08:52.247
I know, but now I think we should keep her.

01:08:52.667 --> 01:08:54.109
Sometimes it's...

01:08:56.965 --> 01:08:59.493
Sometimes maybe it's not such a good idea

01:08:59.575 --> 01:09:01.403
to change things quite so much.

01:09:10.393 --> 01:09:11.395
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:20.841

01:10:20.931 --> 01:10:22.600
Shit. (COUGHS)

01:10:25.359 --> 01:10:26.394
Are you okay?

01:10:27.462 --> 01:10:28.465
(SPITS)

01:10:28.557 --> 01:10:31.427
Yeah. I'm fine. Follow me.

01:10:42.786 --> 01:10:44.498
That's Ray Marcus.

01:10:44.559 --> 01:10:46.356
He's been named as a frequent companion

01:10:46.423 --> 01:10:48.348
of Lou Bates and Steve Adams.

01:10:48.978 --> 01:10:51.073
Part-time electrician,
part-time plumber,

01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:53.701
hence the clever toilet facilities.

01:10:53.756 --> 01:10:55.473
He's not a bad match to your description

01:10:55.537 --> 01:10:57.708
and the fella at the hold-up.

01:10:57.782 --> 01:11:00.151
No fingerprints, but we knew that before.

01:11:00.237 --> 01:11:02.152
I wonder why there aren't any fingerprints.

01:11:02.217 --> 01:11:04.305
ANDES: Well, his hands
were probably on your wife.

01:11:06.055 --> 01:11:10.456
His record's clean, except for
a rape charge that got dropped.

01:11:10.495 --> 01:11:12.880
I heard from this barman at
this place, Line Camp Bar,

01:11:12.948 --> 01:11:14.771
that Ray lives here with a girl named Leila

01:11:14.806 --> 01:11:16.316
but he also keeps another spot

01:11:16.357 --> 01:11:18.173
to take girls she don't know about,

01:11:18.231 --> 01:11:21.123
probably your murder trailer
before it got notorious.

01:11:23.660 --> 01:11:25.449
Does he look like he could be the guy?

01:11:25.521 --> 01:11:27.157
Yes, that's him.

01:11:27.277 --> 01:11:28.479
Good.

01:11:29.512 --> 01:11:30.905
Let's talk to him.

01:11:43.986 --> 01:11:47.082
- Hey, Ray.
- What the fuck?

01:11:47.369 --> 01:11:48.685
Who the hell are you?

01:11:49.358 --> 01:11:50.694
Get off my property, man.

01:11:53.021 --> 01:11:54.438
Shit, I'll call you back.

01:11:54.473 --> 01:11:56.112
I wanna ask you some questions.

01:11:56.253 --> 01:11:57.690
Fuck you.

01:11:58.295 --> 01:12:00.133
I'm occupied at the moment.

01:12:02.157 --> 01:12:04.429
- What's that?
- ANDES: Just a few questions, that's all.

01:12:04.481 --> 01:12:08.242
- We need you to come with us.
- What for? I ain't done nothin'.

01:12:08.326 --> 01:12:10.923
- I ain't saying you did.
- Well, ask me here.

01:12:10.958 --> 01:12:13.552
No, we need you to take
a little drive with us.

01:12:13.587 --> 01:12:15.623
Come on, finish up what
you're doing and let's go.

01:12:15.730 --> 01:12:16.832
Do you mind turning round?

Fucking unbelievable.

01:12:36.999 --> 01:12:38.052
Come on, now.

01:12:39.401 --> 01:12:41.717
All right, come on. Get dressed. Come on.

- ANDES: Yeah.

01:12:52.244 --> 01:12:55.803
- Yeah, that's what we're doing, ain't it?
- You ain't read me my rights.

01:12:55.884 --> 01:12:56.884
(COUGHS)

01:13:01.729 --> 01:13:04.349
- You know your rights, Ray.
- You're supposed to read 'em to me.

01:13:06.268 --> 01:13:08.337
I read you your rights, didn't I, Tony?

01:13:10.032 --> 01:13:11.602
Uh-huh.

01:13:11.634 --> 01:13:12.930
I read you your rights.

01:13:12.972 --> 01:13:15.480
This ain't legal, man. I'm supposed
to have a lawyer or something.

01:13:15.504 --> 01:13:17.062
Calm down, sunshine.

01:13:17.113 --> 01:13:20.014
This is just informal
questioning, that's all.

01:13:20.071 --> 01:13:22.842
You're helping me out. I ain't
charged you with nothing yet.

01:13:22.930 --> 01:13:25.567
Now, if you want a lawyer, I
can take you down to the station

01:13:25.648 --> 01:13:26.848
and charge you with something.

01:13:26.884 --> 01:13:29.467
Oh, come on, man, listen,
you ain't gotta take me in.

01:13:29.519 --> 01:13:31.177
I'm answering the
questions, ain't I? Come on.

01:13:31.201 --> 01:13:33.890
(CLAPS HANDS) Give me some
questions. I'll answer your questions.

01:13:33.941 --> 01:13:36.823
I don't know any more about this
hold-up than I did before I met you.

- (EXHALES)
- I tell you what,

01:13:37.668 --> 01:13:38.972
I'm gonna ask you a different question.

01:13:38.996 --> 01:13:41.875
- You recognize this car?
- (SIGHS) What car?

01:13:41.930 --> 01:13:44.303
This one. The one we're driving around in.

01:13:44.347 --> 01:13:46.107
Why should I recognize this fucking car?

01:13:46.182 --> 01:13:47.526
It ain't familiar to you?

01:13:47.587 --> 01:13:49.387
It don't remind you of
nothing, take you back?

01:13:49.412 --> 01:13:51.648
- Why should it?
- You don't remember driving it?

01:13:51.768 --> 01:13:54.722
- I think I'd know.
- Yeah. How about the driver?

01:13:54.837 --> 01:13:56.007
- What?
- This fella?

01:13:56.058 --> 01:13:59.066
This fella sitting behind the
steering wheel. My friend Tony?

01:13:59.154 --> 01:14:00.290
You remember him?

01:14:02.925 --> 01:14:06.444
I can't see him. Make him turn around.

01:14:07.132 --> 01:14:08.543
ANDES: Stop the car, Tony.

01:14:13.502 --> 01:14:15.533
ANDES: Turn around and
look at this piece of shit.

01:14:18.815 --> 01:14:20.828
- Who is this guy?
- You don't remember him?

01:14:22.953 --> 01:14:25.122
- Can't say I do.
- You remember him, Tony?

01:14:25.241 --> 01:14:27.675
- Yes.
- Well, refresh his memory.

01:14:27.769 --> 01:14:29.205
Last summer on the interstate.

01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:31.276
Tell him what you remember he did.

01:14:31.333 --> 01:14:33.336
You killed my wife and my daughter.

01:14:33.416 --> 01:14:35.743
That's crazy. I never killed nobody.

01:14:35.818 --> 01:14:37.962
- ANDES: Tell him the whole thing.
- Mmm-mmm.

01:14:38.013 --> 01:14:40.658
You and your buddies on the
interstate, you forced us off the road.

01:14:40.716 --> 01:14:42.486
- ANDES: Tell him who his buddies are.
- Lou and Turk.

01:14:42.510 --> 01:14:43.342
You remember that, Ray?

01:14:43.377 --> 01:14:45.897
You remember horsing around on
the interstate with your buddies,

01:14:45.938 --> 01:14:47.358
playing chicken with the other cars?

01:14:47.382 --> 01:14:49.866
You're crazy. That's crazy.

01:14:49.931 --> 01:14:52.935
TONY: You made us stop and we had a
flat tire and Lou and Turk fixed it.

01:14:52.970 --> 01:14:55.079
Then you and Turk got in my
car with my wife and my daughter

01:14:55.103 --> 01:14:58.474
- and you forced me in your car with Lou.
- ANDES: What then, Tony?

01:14:58.547 --> 01:15:00.500
Lou took me out into the
brush and kicked me out.

01:15:01.483 --> 01:15:03.518
And you came back in my car

01:15:03.553 --> 01:15:05.677
and you called out for me,
trying to lure me into your trap.

01:15:05.701 --> 01:15:08.237
You came back where Lou had left me

01:15:08.351 --> 01:15:10.286
ANDES: Oh, is that why
you went back there, Ray?

01:15:15.124 --> 01:15:16.126
(SCOFFS)

01:15:17.935 --> 01:15:20.766
- You're fucking crazy!
- Tell him what we found there, Tony.

01:15:21.723 --> 01:15:24.680
- TONY: You tell him.
- Do I have to? Don't you know, Ray?

01:15:27.636 --> 01:15:29.771
Y'all are crazy. It's crazy.

01:15:29.806 --> 01:15:32.409
TONY: The bodies of my wife and child

01:15:33.755 --> 01:15:37.442
which you took back there and dumped.

01:15:39.474 --> 01:15:42.244
You're the one. I know you.

01:15:42.831 --> 01:15:44.766
What do you say, Ray?

01:15:44.835 --> 01:15:47.308
You're crazy. You're making a big mistake.

01:15:47.382 --> 01:15:49.952
ANDES: Mmm. I don't think so.

01:15:50.003 --> 01:15:53.771
I don't think so, Ray. Put
your hands out in front of you.

01:15:53.881 --> 01:15:56.184
- You got no right.
- Got no right?

01:15:56.265 --> 01:15:58.771
Rights, rights, rights.
You and your goddamn rights.

01:15:58.852 --> 01:16:00.452
Speaking of rights, I
just wanna let you know

01:16:00.476 --> 01:16:02.741
I'm recording this entire conversation.

01:16:03.084 --> 01:16:05.187
There. You clear?

01:16:05.342 --> 01:16:07.357
- Mmm-hmm.
- All right, let's go, Tony.

01:16:10.692 --> 01:16:12.894
ANDES: Now, we're going to
a place you might remember,

01:16:12.929 --> 01:16:15.499
and you can help yourself
out by telling me about it.

01:16:15.737 --> 01:16:17.373
But if you don't remember,

01:16:17.559 --> 01:16:20.178
Tony does, all right?

01:16:20.256 --> 01:16:22.498
RAY: Hey, I'm sorry you
lost your folks, man.

01:16:22.558 --> 01:16:25.883
It's a shame. But I didn't
have nothin' to do with it.

01:16:45.327 --> 01:16:47.429
- What's this place?
- You know this place.

01:16:47.517 --> 01:16:49.612
- Honest to God, I don't.
- You wanna get out, Tony?

01:16:49.667 --> 01:16:51.625
- ANDES: Shall we have a look inside, Ray?
- RAY: What for?

01:16:51.649 --> 01:16:53.009
ANDES: Come on, let's take a look.

01:17:07.998 --> 01:17:09.946
All right, all right.

01:17:14.958 --> 01:17:16.825
Oh, you raped them on the bed, I suppose.

01:17:16.913 --> 01:17:18.913
- I never raped nobody.
- Stop fucking around, Ray.

01:17:18.977 --> 01:17:21.379
We seen your record. We know
about that girl in Lubbock.

01:17:21.414 --> 01:17:23.801
The charges were dropped.
I never raped nobody.

01:17:23.845 --> 01:17:24.938
I wanna know, Ray.

01:17:26.821 --> 01:17:29.172
I wanna know the exact
story, what you did to them.

01:17:31.528 --> 01:17:34.297
- You'll have to ask somebody else.
- I wanna know what they said.

01:17:37.052 --> 01:17:38.622
I wanna know what my wife said

01:17:38.685 --> 01:17:40.392
and I wanna know what my daughter said.

01:17:50.787 --> 01:17:52.368
I wanna know how you killed them.

01:17:53.420 --> 01:17:55.836
And I wanna know if they
knew it was happening to them.

01:17:55.919 --> 01:17:57.574
I wanna know what they felt!

01:18:01.197 --> 01:18:03.094
I wanna know if they hurt.

01:18:07.002 --> 01:18:08.005
Answer me!

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:11.001
Answer me!

01:18:14.271 --> 01:18:16.503
Answer me, you fucking bastard!

01:18:16.612 --> 01:18:17.613
(GRUNTS)

01:18:34.690 --> 01:18:35.692
Is it better?

01:18:36.932 --> 01:18:39.352
You're gonna take this
the wrong way, but, um,

01:18:40.088 --> 01:18:43.001
I think that you should write
about something other than yourself.

01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:44.842
(CHUCKLES)

01:18:47.137 --> 01:18:49.048
Nobody writes about
anything but themselves.

01:18:49.084 --> 01:18:51.248
I just, my mind started to
wander when I was reading it,

01:18:51.272 --> 01:18:53.389
and that's not good, right?

01:18:53.456 --> 01:18:54.547
I don't know what to do. Maybe, you know,

01:18:54.571 --> 01:18:56.329
maybe I don't have a book in me.

01:18:56.410 --> 01:18:58.945
Maybe give yourself some
space. Just do something else.

01:18:59.022 --> 01:18:59.932
- Can you not do that?
- What?

01:18:59.989 --> 01:19:02.216
Because it... That makes me feel
like you don't believe in me.

01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:04.985
- Edward, that's not what I said.
- No, you didn't say that.

01:19:05.075 --> 01:19:06.337
But you're saying it with your face

01:19:06.361 --> 01:19:07.774
and you're saying it when you sigh.

01:19:07.824 --> 01:19:10.405
Whatever, you're saying it when you
say you want me to go back to school.

01:19:10.429 --> 01:19:11.912
Well, yeah, I do want
you to go back to school.

01:19:11.936 --> 01:19:13.111
I don't see what's wrong with that.

01:19:13.135 --> 01:19:14.593
I mean, I'm just being a realist.

01:19:14.633 --> 01:19:17.555
I mean, you're gonna work at a
book store and just write a novel,

01:19:17.599 --> 01:19:20.175
like that's what you
wanna do with your life?

01:19:22.657 --> 01:19:25.994
I mean, that's really romantic,
but, like, what? This is it?

01:19:26.115 --> 01:19:28.435
- This is it? This is what...
- You sound like your mother.

01:19:31.133 --> 01:19:35.104
Well, you always said that I
reminded you so much of her, so...

01:19:35.451 --> 01:19:37.391
You know, this is exactly why
I don't wanna read your work

01:19:37.415 --> 01:19:39.250
because you always get
so fucking defensive.

01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:41.052
Yeah, of course I'm defensive!

01:19:41.188 --> 01:19:44.258
Do you know what it feels like to put
yourself out on the line creatively

01:19:44.293 --> 01:19:47.516
and then have someone you love tell
you that they don't understand it?

01:19:47.570 --> 01:19:49.548
No, I don't, because I'm not creative...

01:19:49.583 --> 01:19:51.303
EDWARD: That's because
you choose not to be.

01:19:54.209 --> 01:19:57.314
I don't wanna fight.
I'm tired and I'm edgy.

01:19:57.349 --> 01:20:00.623
I've been writing all night. I just
wanted you to like it, all right?

01:20:09.038 --> 01:20:10.039
Thanks.

01:20:20.916 --> 01:20:22.997
ANDES: <i>I got some news
you're not gonna like.</i>

01:20:23.932 --> 01:20:25.923
They're letting Ray Marcus go.

01:20:25.958 --> 01:20:28.056
TONY: <i>What? What do you
mean, they're letting him go?</i>

01:20:28.636 --> 01:20:31.167
The D.A. says we don't
have enough hard evidence,

01:20:31.281 --> 01:20:32.966
what we have is circumstantial.

01:20:33.683 --> 01:20:35.564
He needs corroboration.

01:20:36.712 --> 01:20:37.712
(TONY SCOFFS)

01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:40.406
I'm real sorry, Tony.

01:20:41.884 --> 01:20:43.494
It's a goddamn shame.

01:20:45.307 --> 01:20:47.027
At least you got to lay a good belt on him.

01:20:47.072 --> 01:20:50.132
<i>No, that's not enough.
What else can we do?</i>

01:20:51.686 --> 01:20:52.956
I can think of something.

01:20:54.262 --> 01:20:55.832
You'd better get here quick, though.

01:20:55.917 --> 01:20:57.603
He ain't gonna stick around for long.

01:20:58.285 --> 01:20:59.839
<i>Okay, all right, I'm leaving now.</i>

01:21:03.705 --> 01:21:04.706
What?

01:21:06.108 --> 01:21:09.877
I told you, I got lung
cancer. It's metastasized.

01:21:10.874 --> 01:21:14.431
- But you smoke all the time.
- Yeah, well, that's how it works.

01:21:14.936 --> 01:21:17.263
What's the point in quitting
now? I'll be dead in a year.

01:21:17.333 --> 01:21:19.169
- (SIGHS)
- It's this fella named Jenks.

01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:21.136
He's the lawyer the
court appointed for Ray.

01:21:21.196 --> 01:21:23.472
He's a little smartass from Dallas.

01:21:23.819 --> 01:21:26.732
He and the D.A. made a deal
and Ray got off. Politics.

01:21:26.793 --> 01:21:28.836
When did you tell me you were sick?

01:21:28.871 --> 01:21:30.941
See, they're trying to force me out.

01:21:31.046 --> 01:21:33.452
They already got another
fella lined up for the job.

01:21:33.542 --> 01:21:34.773
I don't understand what
you're talking about.

01:21:34.797 --> 01:21:36.537
They'd drop a murder case to do that?

01:21:36.620 --> 01:21:40.714
Oh, yeah. Give 'em the reason, ammunition.

01:21:41.197 --> 01:21:44.867
They said my case wasn't well-prepared,
was a sloppy job, slapdash,

01:21:44.902 --> 01:21:47.873
no evidence and evidence
improperly gathered,

01:21:48.001 --> 01:21:49.383
won't stand up in court.

01:21:51.159 --> 01:21:55.098
The D.A.'s too much of a chickenshit
to take a case he might lose.

01:21:58.653 --> 01:22:00.092
They're not dropping Lou.

01:22:02.770 --> 01:22:05.483
Well, it's no fucking
good if we don't get Ray.

01:22:06.977 --> 01:22:08.873
Good.

01:22:08.964 --> 01:22:10.993
That's what I was hoping you'd say.

01:22:11.733 --> 01:22:16.205
They want me to retire and enjoy the
benefits of my cancer somewhere else.

01:22:16.264 --> 01:22:18.800
- Fuck that.
- You never told me about the cancer.

01:22:18.841 --> 01:22:20.606
The problem with Ray is his alibi.

01:22:20.647 --> 01:22:21.783
You have a family?

01:22:21.924 --> 01:22:24.227
- Ray claims he was with that little...
- Bobby. Bobby.

01:22:24.912 --> 01:22:25.915
What?

01:22:27.703 --> 01:22:29.591
Do you have anyone in your life?

01:22:35.785 --> 01:22:38.288
No. No wife or...

01:22:41.409 --> 01:22:43.356
I have a daughter in Corpus.

01:22:47.201 --> 01:22:48.760
Has she been a help?

01:22:52.915 --> 01:22:55.134
She doesn't know. What can she do about it?

01:23:00.308 --> 01:23:02.152
Anyway, Ray claims

01:23:02.238 --> 01:23:04.893
he was with that little girl,
Leila whatever her name is,

01:23:04.943 --> 01:23:06.765
and she backs him up.

01:23:06.835 --> 01:23:08.304
Her aunt backs her up.

01:23:08.543 --> 01:23:09.802
What are we gonna do?

01:23:12.689 --> 01:23:16.820
It's a question of how serious
you are about seeing justice done.

01:23:19.140 --> 01:23:20.410
You get me?

01:23:26.589 --> 01:23:29.110
(EXHALES) I can't eat. Gonna throw up.

01:23:29.189 --> 01:23:31.305
How are you gonna get
anything done if you can't eat?

01:23:31.340 --> 01:23:34.714
Sometimes I can, sometimes I
can't. This place is terrible.

01:23:34.776 --> 01:23:36.064
I need you to eat something.

01:23:47.703 --> 01:23:49.833
So let me ask you a personal question.

01:23:51.359 --> 01:23:53.382
Off the record, between you and me.

01:23:54.451 --> 01:23:56.687
What do you want me to do with Ray Marcus?

01:23:56.745 --> 01:23:58.447
Well, what can you do with him?

01:23:58.507 --> 01:24:01.377

I got nothin' to lose.

01:24:14.340 --> 01:24:17.611
I'm not gonna let this asshole
D.A. fuck up my last case.

01:24:17.799 --> 01:24:20.463
I'm also not gonna stand by
and watch a murderer go free.

01:24:20.516 --> 01:24:25.027
I've seen too many sick fucks like
Ray Marcus get off over the years.

01:24:25.554 --> 01:24:28.542
Now, are you willing to go outside
of strict procedure on this?

01:24:28.577 --> 01:24:29.852
Yes.

01:24:30.051 --> 01:24:31.454
- You sure?
- Yes.

You're kidding? All right, thanks.

Ray just showed up at Line Camp.

01:24:51.385 --> 01:24:53.743
I'm gonna let that little
idiot get nice and liquored up

01:24:53.811 --> 01:24:56.970
and then I'm gonna go grab his
ass and take him to my camp.

01:24:57.665 --> 01:24:59.233
And I want you to come with me.

01:24:59.350 --> 01:25:01.911
We're gonna keep him for a
little while, work him over a bit,

01:25:01.943 --> 01:25:04.499
get a little rough, make him suffer.

01:25:05.527 --> 01:25:07.574
And then we'll see what he does.

01:25:09.256 --> 01:25:10.507

that this is not working.</i>

We are not working. We are too different.

- We are not right for each other.
- Susan, stop.

No, we're not right for each other.

- We are perfect for each other.
- No, we're not perfect for each other, Edward.

We may be perfect for each other

01:25:32.574 --> 01:25:34.034
if we didn't live in the real world,

01:25:34.107 --> 01:25:37.147

need a life that is more structured.

- I did not call you weak.

01:27:45.961 --> 01:27:47.129
You follow.

01:28:02.858 --> 01:28:03.858
Sit up.

01:28:08.231 --> 01:28:11.323
ANDES: Oh, Jesus. I'm gonna be
sick. Tony, get over here, quick.

01:28:11.738 --> 01:28:13.574
Here, you use this, right?

01:28:13.709 --> 01:28:15.589
You shoot him if he gets out of line.

01:28:16.852 --> 01:28:17.853

01:28:24.404 --> 01:28:25.915
Boo.

01:28:25.981 --> 01:28:28.083
Hey, man, this ain't
legal. If this were legal,

01:28:28.150 --> 01:28:30.728
you'd have taken me to the
station, not this fucking place.

01:28:30.871 --> 01:28:32.729
It's all the legal we need, boy.

01:28:36.479 --> 01:28:38.848
- There ain't no new evidence.
- Oh, yeah?

01:28:38.994 --> 01:28:42.238
Why don't you take me in if
you got new evidence? Huh?

01:28:43.063 --> 01:28:45.427
I like it better here. It's more relaxed.

01:28:47.042 --> 01:28:49.678
It seems to me you
tried this trick already.

01:28:49.752 --> 01:28:51.272
If you think this guy's
gonna break me down,

01:28:51.296 --> 01:28:53.308
- you already seen that don't work.
- Oh, yeah,

01:28:54.110 --> 01:28:55.675
but what would you say if I told you

01:28:55.770 --> 01:28:57.675
your friend Lou Bates implicated you

01:28:57.719 --> 01:28:59.520
- in the Hastings murders?
- (RAY CHUCKLES)

01:29:00.662 --> 01:29:02.672
If Lou had done that, you
would have taken me in.

01:29:02.766 --> 01:29:05.602
Well, don't worry, we'll
get you to the station.

01:29:05.720 --> 01:29:07.936
- (DOOR OPENING)
- Don't worry. Oh, who's this?

01:29:10.012 --> 01:29:12.581
- ANDES: Well, looky here.
- You son of a bitch.

01:29:13.414 --> 01:29:14.716
- ANDES: All right.
- (GROANS)

01:29:15.456 --> 01:29:18.208
Okay, come on, boy. Get over there.

01:29:18.819 --> 01:29:21.044
- Lou, what'd you fucking tell this guy?
- I didn't tell him nothin'.

01:29:21.068 --> 01:29:23.816
No, he said you told him I was the
one who killed this guy's wife and kid.

01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:25.714
What? That's what he told me about you.

01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:28.640
You're supposed to be the lawman.
What kind of bullshit is this?

01:29:28.711 --> 01:29:29.712
Fuck off

01:29:30.278 --> 01:29:31.825
both of you.

01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:35.336
Now, do you two have any last
words you wanna say to each other?

01:29:38.466 --> 01:29:40.201
I think what we should do, Tony,

01:29:40.236 --> 01:29:41.957
is we should just kill them right now.

01:29:42.924 --> 01:29:44.978
It's gonna be rough for 'em out there,

01:29:45.726 --> 01:29:47.890
not knowing how it's gonna come.

01:29:48.509 --> 01:29:52.228
Maybe Ray'll get killed
for resisting arrest, huh?

01:29:57.813 --> 01:29:59.889
Coming home late at night,

01:30:01.277 --> 01:30:03.361
he might get shot by a burglar.

01:30:10.853 --> 01:30:13.225
Ooh. Come on up here.

01:30:14.294 --> 01:30:16.464
Yeah, you look like you're
feeling uncomfortable.

01:30:17.449 --> 01:30:18.771
- What?
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

01:30:18.827 --> 01:30:19.827
What's that?

01:30:21.149 --> 01:30:22.893
I ain't gonna kill you, son.

01:30:23.103 --> 01:30:24.205
I'm a policeman.

01:30:26.140 --> 01:30:27.573
What, you gonna cry?

01:30:27.755 --> 01:30:29.224
Are you gonna cry?

01:30:30.846 --> 01:30:35.190
Aw, okay. Well, since you're
feeling so uncomfortable...

01:30:35.272 --> 01:30:36.474
Tony, get over here.

01:30:37.112 --> 01:30:38.247
Take this.

01:30:39.421 --> 01:30:41.140
- Go on, right here, okay?
- Please don't.

01:30:41.193 --> 01:30:43.370
- Fuck.
- Right here, right here.

01:30:43.484 --> 01:30:45.251

feeling uncomfortable too.

Okay, come on up.

There you go. Free as a bird.

01:30:58.679 --> 01:31:00.982
Okay? How about it?

01:31:01.170 --> 01:31:04.127
What do you say, Tony? Now,
what shall we do with these two?

01:31:06.145 --> 01:31:07.309
What you gonna do?

01:31:08.310 --> 01:31:09.978
What you gonna do, son?

I regret it now.

You know, I'm Catholic. I
don't even believe in abortions.

01:32:41.249 --> 01:32:42.441
I'm so sorry.

01:32:43.917 --> 01:32:45.549
I feel so useless.

01:32:48.069 --> 01:32:51.244
You're anything but useless. You
always know exactly what to do.

be able to look at Edward again

01:33:02.309 --> 01:33:04.011
after what I did to his child.

01:33:04.159 --> 01:33:05.674
He'll never find out.

I should have seen it coming.

Ray gets to the road, he's gonna hitchhike.

01:34:54.224 --> 01:34:55.958
We gotta catch him before he gets a ride.

Now, listen to me.

01:34:57.039 --> 01:34:59.459
When you get to the fork in
the road, you veer to the left.

01:34:59.494 --> 01:35:01.791
That's gonna take you back
towards where he took your folks.

01:35:01.815 --> 01:35:03.979
I suspect he's gonna go for the highway.

01:35:04.076 --> 01:35:05.806
I'll go that direction.

don't really give a shit.

you don't know how to use.

friend, you know that, right?

I don't think so.

01:37:48.741 --> 01:37:50.176
(MOCKINGLY) You don't think so?

01:37:51.104 --> 01:37:52.935
Well, then, what the fuck do you want?

01:37:55.110 --> 01:37:57.054
You and that silly gun.

01:37:58.653 --> 01:38:00.479

you are with that thing.

hang out with a guy like
Andes who kills people?

01:38:23.644 --> 01:38:24.989
You kill people.

01:38:32.140 --> 01:38:35.566
They had it coming to 'em, your
fucking wife and that kid, but you...

01:38:35.777 --> 01:38:37.816
You got me wrong, it was an accident.

01:38:37.851 --> 01:38:39.465
It was an accident?

01:38:39.500 --> 01:38:42.653
I got a certain pride
in how people talk to me.

01:38:43.684 --> 01:38:46.075
There are certain things
I don't put up with.

01:38:46.833 --> 01:38:49.676
When someone accuses me of something,

01:38:49.711 --> 01:38:51.679
that's a fucking insult.

01:38:52.847 --> 01:38:54.596
It gives me the right.

01:38:55.455 --> 01:38:58.545
If my woman accuses me
of fucking somebody else,

01:38:58.606 --> 01:39:01.036
well, then, I'll go fuck somebody else.

01:39:02.884 --> 01:39:06.081

a rapist, then she gets raped.

what you did to us. Nobody.

01:39:24.907 --> 01:39:26.845
Well, then, you should just kill me, then.

01:39:28.570 --> 01:39:29.705
Right?

01:39:30.857 --> 01:39:32.494
You should fucking kill me.

01:39:40.494 --> 01:39:42.505
It's fun to kill people.
