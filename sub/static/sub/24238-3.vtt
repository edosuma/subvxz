00:27.514 --> 00:30.649
That's the same dream I had
before all the psychisms

00:30.685 --> 00:31.685
came crawling out.

00:32.040 --> 00:33.750
Someone's messing with my head.

00:33.890 --> 00:36.220
Maybe it's early-onset dementia.

00:36.632 --> 00:38.297
Ah, I should be so lucky.

00:39.454 --> 00:41.356
<i>Ladies and
gentlemen, as we prepare for landing,</i>

00:41.380 --> 00:44.465
<i>please be certain your seat
belts are securely fastened.</i>

00:44.700 --> 00:46.030
No problem.

00:50.857 --> 00:52.040
Beautiful, isn't it?

00:52.076 --> 00:54.425
We're not on a sightseeing
tour, knob-head.

00:54.460 --> 00:57.805
I don't know how I let you
talk me into taking you along.

00:57.841 --> 00:59.386
It's my natural charm.

00:59.546 --> 01:00.876
You can't resist it.

01:02.020 --> 01:03.770
She's my kid, John.

01:04.290 --> 01:05.800
I have to be part of this.

01:07.124 --> 01:09.465
Besides, you need a driver.

01:09.615 --> 01:11.283
I can drive myself.

01:11.569 --> 01:13.797
Ha! Come off it. Five
minutes behind the wheel,

01:13.833 --> 01:15.546
and you'll be wrapped
around a palm tree.

01:17.350 --> 01:20.430
Good thing I can depend
on your nerves of steel.

01:23.000 --> 01:27.720
Listen, we're messing with
deep, dark magic here, Chas.

01:27.856 --> 01:29.396
Deeper than Newcastle?

01:33.880 --> 01:35.885
Can't change the past, Chas.

01:36.020 --> 01:37.020
<i>No.</i>

01:37.700 --> 01:39.490
But you can change this.

01:48.250 --> 01:50.460
Even if we can save Trish...

01:50.890 --> 01:51.980
We will.

01:52.980 --> 01:54.930
You will.

02:03.120 --> 02:05.520
If there's one thing I've
learned over the years,

02:05.960 --> 02:08.345
it's that there are no happy endings.

02:08.479 --> 02:09.720
There never are.

02:11.700 --> 02:13.580
There's always a price to pay.

02:14.790 --> 02:17.790
No price is too high when
it comes to my little girl.

02:19.460 --> 02:21.480
Tell me that after you've paid it, mate.

02:23.510 --> 02:25.880
Yeah. You're gonna be a huge help.

02:47.673 --> 02:50.345
Come on, knob-head, let's go
pay a visit to the bastard

02:50.380 --> 02:51.651
who's got your girl.

02:59.380 --> 03:00.960
<i>You think it's a trap?</i>

03:02.960 --> 03:04.385
- John.
- What?

03:04.420 --> 03:05.745
You think it's a trap?

03:05.780 --> 03:08.200
Chas, it's always a bloody trap.

03:14.550 --> 03:17.340
Are you sure we're the only
ones who can see that...

03:17.700 --> 03:19.080
whatever it is?

03:19.170 --> 03:21.638
The Shield of Ermed will
protect Trish's body,

03:21.674 --> 03:24.384
anchor it here while John
searches out her soul.

03:24.620 --> 03:28.490
Lost souls, mystic shields, demons.
This is...

03:29.180 --> 03:31.140
Oh, this is crazy.

03:32.280 --> 03:35.450
You people go about your lives
like sleepwalkers.

03:37.460 --> 03:39.615
You have no idea what's out there.

03:39.922 --> 03:42.882
The darkness that's hovering on
the periphery of your vision.

03:48.250 --> 03:49.720
I know more than you think.

03:50.660 --> 03:52.280
The darkness you talk about.

03:52.970 --> 03:55.090
It nearly destroyed my husband.

03:55.493 --> 03:58.344
He was with John in Newcastle.

03:58.380 --> 04:01.120
- So you know the story?
- Just scraps of it.

04:01.720 --> 04:04.220
Johnny boy likes to brag
about his exploits.

04:04.390 --> 04:05.560
But not that one.

04:06.530 --> 04:10.200
It was years before
Chas finally told me.

04:10.890 --> 04:13.815
- Tell me.
- About Newcastle?

04:13.850 --> 04:14.980
No.

04:15.720 --> 04:17.760
I can't. I just...

04:19.450 --> 04:21.890
It wasn't a request.

04:26.170 --> 04:29.465
<i>They were inseparable,
John and Chas,</i>

04:29.501 --> 04:32.091
<i>from the time they were kids
growing up in Liverpool.</i>

04:32.384 --> 04:33.935
<i>Looked after each other.</i>

04:34.650 --> 04:36.650
<i>God knows their families couldn't.</i>

04:36.990 --> 04:38.450
<i>Opposites, you know?</i>

04:38.910 --> 04:42.450
<i>Chas was attracted
to John's unpredictability.</i>

04:42.840 --> 04:46.511
<i>And John, he was drawn
to Chas's soft heart.</i>

04:47.120 --> 04:49.910
<i>I think it was the music more
than anything that bonded them.</i>

04:50.380 --> 04:51.880
<i>They were obsessed.</i>

04:52.530 --> 04:55.580
<i>Had to learn to play.
Had to form a band.</i>

04:57.290 --> 04:59.385
<i>They spent years performing in shitholes</i>

04:59.420 --> 05:01.443
<i>for a percentage of the door.</i>

05:01.830 --> 05:05.050
<i>They always thought they were a
day away from fame and fortune.</i>

05:05.990 --> 05:07.950
<i>Maybe it would've worked out</i>

05:08.250 --> 05:10.210
<i>if they hadn't ended up in Newcastle.</i>

05:11.669 --> 05:16.579
<i>The Casanova Club was run by a
twisted bastard named Alex Logue.</i>

05:16.830 --> 05:18.720
<i>Fancied himself a sorcerer.</i>

05:19.761 --> 05:23.255
<i>Had what he called "magical
convocations" in the rooms</i>

05:23.290 --> 05:24.484
<i>under the club.</i>

05:24.520 --> 05:26.099
<i>Don't ask me what that means.</i>

05:26.135 --> 05:27.305
<i>I don't wanna know.</i>
