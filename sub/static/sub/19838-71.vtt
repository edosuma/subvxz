00:03.550 --> 00:09.190
<b>After challenging Meruem to a 
contest in order to buy time,</b>

00:09.190 --> 00:14.050
<b>Pouf was now scattering scales on the 
citizens who were not yet hypnotized.</b>

00:14.890 --> 00:19.490
<b><i>I must hurry or Meruem-sama 
will remember that woman...</i></b>

00:22.340 --> 00:24.590
<b>We haven't moved forward at all.</b>

00:25.010 --> 00:28.000
<b>What's going on up ahead?</b>

00:28.000 --> 00:30.170
<b>Shh, no talking!</b>

00:30.540 --> 00:31.990
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

00:31.990 --> 00:35.430
<b>The soldiers are held up in the back.</b>

00:36.140 --> 00:39.480
<b>I heard all their commanders have 
collapsed, one after another...</b>

00:39.480 --> 00:41.780
<b>Like puppets whose strings have been cut.</b>

00:43.270 --> 00:47.070
<b>There haven't been any warnings 
about stepping out of line anymore.</b>

00:47.970 --> 00:50.990
<b>I keep hearing loud noises 
coming from the palace...</b>

00:50.990 --> 00:52.020
<b>Something is weird!</b>

00:52.680 --> 00:54.020
<b>Maybe...</b>

00:54.020 --> 00:55.200
<b>It's a coup d'état?</b>

01:07.380 --> 01:12.700
<b><i>After giving the King 6/7 of my body,</i></b>

01:12.700 --> 01:14.120
<b><i>I've lost a lot of my power.</i></b>

01:15.460 --> 01:17.520
<b><i>The scales aren't scattering well.</i></b>

01:18.230 --> 01:21.720
<b><i>And I don't see any of Pitou's puppets.</i></b>

01:22.860 --> 01:26.010
<b><i>Does it mean the battle with the boy is so intense,</i></b>

01:26.010 --> 01:30.140
<b><i>Pitou cannot spare energy on puppets?</i></b>

01:31.630 --> 01:35.480
<b><i>The boy didn't look to be that strong.</i></b>

01:36.650 --> 01:40.250
<b><i>I cannot use my clones while 
I'm scattering my scales.</i></b>

01:40.760 --> 01:44.500
<b><i>But I need to hurry and kill the woman.</i></b>

01:44.970 --> 01:46.130
<b><i>Whatever it takes...</i></b>

01:46.570 --> 01:49.740
<b><i>This is my final chance!</i></b>

03:10.960 --> 03:15.960
<b>Deadline x To x Live</b>

03:24.150 --> 03:28.020
<b>Palm, take the four women still here with you.</b>

03:28.020 --> 03:30.230
<b>They didn't run away?</b>

03:30.560 --> 03:31.320
<b>No.</b>

03:32.060 --> 03:34.530
<b>Use duct tape to bind their 
hands and cover their eyes.</b>

03:35.060 --> 03:37.910
<b>If they see me, it'll take too long to explain.</b>

03:38.190 --> 03:40.490
<b>That's true... I understand.</b>

03:41.650 --> 03:44.590
<b>Why did we put them on the truck, anyway?</b>

03:53.860 --> 03:55.130
<b>A messenger?</b>

03:55.870 --> 03:59.650
<b>You just have to tell the King or the Royal Guard</b>

04:00.350 --> 04:02.600
<b>that the woman is in the underground warehouse.</b>

04:03.390 --> 04:06.140
<b>Let them know that we're looking to negotiate.</b>

04:07.850 --> 04:09.450
<b>Once that's done, you're free.</b>

04:10.100 --> 04:12.140
<b>It's probably a trap, right?</b>

04:12.800 --> 04:14.650
<b>That's what I'll tell the King.</b>

04:14.650 --> 04:17.580
<b>If I don't, it'll look unnatural, and he'll suspect me.</b>

04:17.980 --> 04:18.900
<b>Yeah.</b>

04:19.670 --> 04:25.260
<b><i>Wait... Just the fact that I'm doing the 
enemy's bidding may anger the King.</i></b>

04:25.850 --> 04:28.010
<b><i>I'm not gonna dig my own grave.</i></b>

04:32.340 --> 04:34.920
<b>Fine, I'll try it.</b>

04:35.750 --> 04:37.030
<b>Can you drive?</b>

04:37.730 --> 04:39.550
<b>Better than you.</b>

04:45.020 --> 04:48.430
<b><i>It's important that he carries out his mission.</i></b>

04:48.880 --> 04:52.350
<b><i>Perhaps I should keep an eye on him, 
even if it means losing Pouf...</i></b>

04:52.350 --> 04:53.120
<b>Palm.</b>

04:57.470 --> 04:58.440
<b><i>It's okay.</i></b>

05:03.330 --> 05:04.300
<b>Welfin,</b>

05:04.770 --> 05:06.520
<b>once this is over, you're free.</b>

05:08.720 --> 05:10.680
<b>Go and see Gyro.</b>

05:17.070 --> 05:18.780
<b>Don't get too cocky!</b>

05:18.780 --> 05:20.340
<b>I'll kill you!</b>

05:20.580 --> 05:23.250
<b>Don't you dare speak his name!</b>

05:23.250 --> 05:24.840
<b>You would never understand!</b>

05:26.680 --> 05:29.090
<b>I understand, Zaikahal.</b>

05:38.630 --> 05:39.780
<b>How...</b>

05:41.410 --> 05:43.990
<b>How do you know</b>

05:45.390 --> 05:46.640
<b>my former...</b>

05:48.280 --> 05:50.350
<b><i>I didn't tell anyone.</i></b>

05:51.610 --> 05:55.650
<b>I probably won't ever remember my former name,</b>

05:56.510 --> 05:57.870
<b>but we were buddies.</b>

05:58.930 --> 06:00.240
<b>Buddies?</b>

06:00.730 --> 06:01.880
<b>Before we were Ants.</b>

06:09.330 --> 06:10.830
<b>They're our enemies.</b>

06:12.100 --> 06:14.560
<b>Enemies of NGL.</b>

06:17.550 --> 06:18.540
<b>Am I wrong?</b>

06:24.370 --> 06:26.990
<b>Brovada has forgotten his past,</b>

06:27.630 --> 06:29.110
<b>but he was also one of us.</b>

06:29.110 --> 06:30.320
<b>Take him with you.</b>

06:41.540 --> 06:42.640
<b>Ikalgo...</b>

06:43.560 --> 06:46.490
<b>How do you know?</b>

06:47.840 --> 06:49.010
<b>What do you mean?</b>

06:49.810 --> 06:52.410
<b>You told me to go see Gyro.</b>

06:53.350 --> 06:57.020
<b>You'd only say that if you knew Gyro was alive.</b>

06:57.410 --> 06:59.350
<b>Yeah, that's true.</b>

07:00.140 --> 07:01.020
<b>But...</b>

07:01.670 --> 07:03.270
<b>I don't know that he's alive.</b>

07:03.700 --> 07:05.520
<b>I just can't believe otherwise.</b>

07:07.390 --> 07:10.030
<b>Since we all "survived."</b>

07:10.920 --> 07:14.030
<b>He couldn't have just been digested.</b>

07:31.990 --> 07:34.540
<b><i>Damn it... Damn it!</i></b>

07:36.000 --> 07:37.810
<b><i>Damn it!</i></b>

07:52.200 --> 07:54.960
<b><i>Are you sure about this, Pouf?</i></b>

07:55.670 --> 08:00.140
<b><i>Ten minutes have passed, and I don't 
see any sign of Pitou returning...</i></b>

08:16.240 --> 08:17.090
<b>Get out.</b>

08:23.730 --> 08:26.300
<b>Remove your bonds and use a truck to escape.</b>

08:26.920 --> 08:30.310
<b>Once you're outside, you'll understand 
the current situation.</b>

08:51.550 --> 08:52.760
<b><i>I hate to admit it...</i></b>

08:53.870 --> 08:55.650
<b><i>But Ikalgo's right.</i></b>

08:56.450 --> 08:59.360
<b><i>Killing Gyro wouldn't be enough to stop him.</i></b>

09:02.180 --> 09:04.020
<b><i>Which means they're the enemy.</i></b>

09:05.390 --> 09:07.440
<b><i>I owe him for giving me a wake-up call.</i></b>

09:07.860 --> 09:09.880
<b><i>I'll be his messenger!</i></b>

09:30.260 --> 09:31.290
<b>Stop!</b>

09:36.560 --> 09:38.660
<b>Youpi-dono?</b>

09:40.530 --> 09:43.520
<b><i>I already found a Royal Guard.</i></b>

09:51.820 --> 09:52.950
<b>Youpi-dono...</b>

09:53.670 --> 09:57.820
<b>I have a message that must be 
taken to the King immediately.</b>

10:07.610 --> 10:09.090
<b>The underground warehouse?</b>

10:09.090 --> 10:09.960
<b>Yes.</b>

10:10.610 --> 10:12.430
<b>And they're looking to exchange</b>

10:12.430 --> 10:16.350
<b>the woman for their allies that 
have been taken hostage?</b>

10:17.170 --> 10:18.280
<b>Yes.</b>

10:18.280 --> 10:21.280
<b>Please tell the King at once.</b>

10:21.860 --> 10:24.470
<b>Got it... I'm on it.</b>

10:25.360 --> 10:26.470
<b><i>Right...</i></b>

10:26.470 --> 10:30.870
<b><i>We're having a contest, so I 
don't need to tell the King.</i></b>

10:31.680 --> 10:37.040
<b><i>If Pouf was anticipating this, he's a smart one.</i></b>

10:38.850 --> 10:40.600
<b>You can go.</b>

10:41.010 --> 10:42.200
<b>Yes, sir.</b>

10:42.200 --> 10:45.580
<b><i>Once he's back, I need to tell Pouf.</i></b>

10:50.290 --> 10:55.010
<b><i>Still, what's Pitou doing right now?</i></b>

11:00.070 --> 11:01.940
<b><i>Chimera Ants are the enemy.</i></b>

11:07.570 --> 11:08.650
<b><i>Gyro's enemy...</i></b>

11:09.450 --> 11:10.580
<b><i>Our enemy!</i></b>

11:16.480 --> 11:17.670
<b>Youpi-dono!</b>

11:19.330 --> 11:21.050
<b>I have a question!</b>

11:21.780 --> 11:22.700
<b>What is it?</b>

11:23.350 --> 11:25.740
<b>Do you have any memories of your former life?</b>

11:26.360 --> 11:28.700
<b>Memories from before you 
became a Chimera Ant?</b>

11:30.390 --> 11:31.960
<b>No, of course not.</b>

11:32.480 --> 11:35.210
<b>I am the Royal Guard Youpi.</b>

11:35.940 --> 11:37.570
<b>I've never been anyone else.</b>

11:38.160 --> 11:40.470
<b>Don't ask me stupid questions!</b>

11:45.130 --> 11:46.300
<b>Youpi-dono...</b>

11:46.730 --> 11:48.560
<b>Hey! That's enough—</b>

11:55.530 --> 11:58.500
<b>If you attack me, I'll fight back.</b>

11:59.340 --> 12:01.110
<b>I have a few questions for you.</b>

12:01.720 --> 12:03.560
<b>You have five seconds to answer.</b>

12:11.690 --> 12:16.230
<b>Don't get too cocky, you little punk!</b>

12:26.450 --> 12:27.570
<b><i>Contest...</i></b>

12:32.340 --> 12:33.410
<b><i>Contest...</i></b>

12:41.810 --> 12:44.600
<b><i>Something is missing...</i></b>

12:59.800 --> 13:02.050
<b>Marshal</b>

13:05.360 --> 13:11.240
<b>Marshal</b>

13:15.310 --> 13:19.060
<b>Marshal</b>

13:20.280 --> 13:21.700
<b><i>Yes...</i></b>

13:29.950 --> 13:30.990
<b><i>I was</i></b>

13:31.500 --> 13:33.700
<b><i>battling someone.</i></b>

13:36.090 --> 13:37.580
<b><i>Someone</i></b>

13:39.940 --> 13:42.430
<b><i>that I have yet to defeat</i></b>

13:43.770 --> 13:46.690
<b><i>a single time...</i></b>

14:15.710 --> 14:17.760
<b><i>That took much longer than expected.</i></b>

14:18.230 --> 14:20.760
<b><i>By now, Pitou must have returned...</i></b>

14:21.960 --> 14:24.010
<b><i>I hope the King hasn't grown impatient.</i></b>

14:27.920 --> 14:28.940
<b><i>Where's Youpi?</i></b>

14:30.920 --> 14:32.560
<b>Where has Youpi gone?</b>

14:35.020 --> 14:36.240
<b>What's that?</b>

14:48.750 --> 14:49.840
<b>Youpi?</b>

14:56.720 --> 14:59.540
<b>I-It can't be...</b>

15:13.300 --> 15:16.200
<b>We're okay now...</b>

15:16.950 --> 15:19.330
<b>What do you mean, Palm?</b>

15:23.080 --> 15:25.530
<b>King! Meruem-sama!</b>

15:27.810 --> 15:29.370
<b>Youpi has been killed.</b>

15:29.830 --> 15:32.570
<b>There are still skilled enemies around!</b>

15:33.990 --> 15:35.330
<b>Where's Pitou?</b>

15:38.000 --> 15:40.330
<b>Oh, Pitou hasn't returned...</b>

15:40.920 --> 15:42.040
<b>Then...</b>

15:43.010 --> 15:45.740
<b>I can now begin, yes?</b>

15:46.200 --> 15:48.460
<b>W-Wait, Meruem-sama!</b>

15:48.850 --> 15:50.340
<b>The situation has changed...</b>

15:50.920 --> 15:52.750
<b>It's too dangerous! The contest is—</b>

15:52.750 --> 15:54.250
<b>The contest is off?</b>

15:57.640 --> 15:59.650
<b>That means I have won.</b>

16:01.450 --> 16:03.820
<b>Tell me everything you know.</b>

16:06.550 --> 16:07.990
<b>Is that acceptable?</b>

16:11.050 --> 16:13.110
<b>We're okay now?</b>

16:13.650 --> 16:15.460
<b>What do you mean, Palm?</b>

16:16.360 --> 16:21.320
<b>Killua deduced that she is special to the King.</b>

16:21.770 --> 16:25.380
<b>But the Royal Guard is divided...</b>

16:26.600 --> 16:27.900
<b>That is because</b>

16:29.870 --> 16:32.880
<b>Pitou tried to save and protect her,</b>

16:34.140 --> 16:36.150
<b>while Pouf tried to kill her.</b>

16:39.220 --> 16:41.070
<b>In other words,</b>

16:41.820 --> 16:44.560
<b>she is a double-edged sword for the King.</b>

16:45.260 --> 16:46.560
<b>Wait, wait, wait, wait...</b>

16:46.920 --> 16:48.550
<b>I find that hard to believe.</b>

16:49.340 --> 16:51.160
<b>It's impossible</b>

16:51.160 --> 16:54.570
<b>for the Royal Guard to bicker 
and defy the King's will!</b>

16:55.040 --> 16:56.140
<b>Is it?</b>

16:56.540 --> 17:00.870
<b>Then why are you and I here now?</b>

17:01.310 --> 17:04.080
<b>Wouldn't you say it's impossible for Soldier Ants</b>

17:04.080 --> 17:05.750
<b>to side with humans?</b>

17:07.410 --> 17:09.580
<b>Adding humans to the gene pool</b>

17:09.580 --> 17:13.960
<b>has led to many events that would be 
impossible for normal Chimera Ants.</b>

17:13.960 --> 17:16.500
<b>Can you be certain that I'm wrong?</b>

17:19.420 --> 17:20.650
<b>Sorry...</b>

17:21.010 --> 17:23.020
<b>My point is that</b>

17:23.450 --> 17:27.740
<b>the division among the Royal Guard 
may not necessarily contradict</b>

17:27.740 --> 17:30.610
<b>their loyalty to the King.</b>

17:31.370 --> 17:33.880
<b>There is a human that the 
King cares deeply about.</b>

17:34.520 --> 17:37.010
<b>"We must protect that human."</b>

17:37.010 --> 17:39.090
<b>"We must kill that human."</b>

17:39.090 --> 17:40.620
<b>Both reactions make sense.</b>

17:42.440 --> 17:45.380
<b>For now, I'll concede that point to you.</b>

17:46.510 --> 17:49.560
<b>Why does that mean we're okay now?</b>

17:51.080 --> 17:54.880
<b>Twenty minutes have passed 
since the initial wave of <i>En</i>.</b>

17:55.370 --> 18:01.180
<b>But the King hasn't killed or captured us yet.</b>

18:03.920 --> 18:05.810
<b>I don't get it...</b>

18:05.810 --> 18:07.650
<b>What's going on here?</b>

18:08.250 --> 18:12.800
<b>When the <i>En</i> was used, I was carrying this girl.</b>

18:13.910 --> 18:16.420
<b>If the King had noticed,</b>

18:17.310 --> 18:19.660
<b>he would have come straight to me.</b>

18:20.420 --> 18:23.910
<b>He didn't because I had 
concealed her within my hair.</b>

18:24.530 --> 18:28.910
<b>It's possible that he didn't realize 
I was carrying another person.</b>

18:29.660 --> 18:31.130
<b>Are you following me?</b>

18:32.860 --> 18:35.130
<b>It seems logical, so I can't argue that...</b>

18:35.490 --> 18:37.680
<b>But I still don't see your point.</b>

18:38.150 --> 18:44.060
<b>If she's covered up, the King 
can't find her with his <i>En</i>.</b>

18:45.660 --> 18:46.880
<b>Are you suggesting</b>

18:46.880 --> 18:51.190
<b>that we let Knuckle and Meleoron die, 
rather than make an exchange?</b>

18:51.660 --> 18:52.770
<b>Of course not...</b>

18:53.220 --> 18:55.330
<b>We'll offer to make an exchange.</b>

18:55.970 --> 18:59.640
<b>But we'll try to buy as much time as we can.</b>

19:00.040 --> 19:03.890
<b>To accomplish that, we must hide her in a place</b>

19:03.890 --> 19:05.700
<b>where the King cannot find her.</b>

19:06.230 --> 19:08.920
<b>Buy time? How long are we talking?</b>

19:10.810 --> 19:13.730
<b>Until the King dies.</b>

19:24.280 --> 19:27.990
<b><i>What is she talking about?</i></b>

19:34.320 --> 19:35.940
<b>Until the King dies?</b>

19:35.940 --> 19:38.120
<b>Sure, he has to die sometime...</b>

19:38.120 --> 19:41.290
<b>But if we knew when he'd die, 
we wouldn't have a problem!</b>

19:42.500 --> 19:45.140
<b>Why are we okay now?</b>

19:45.140 --> 19:47.090
<b>Give me a proper explanation!</b>

19:50.440 --> 19:55.000
<b>The King will die, and it will happen soon.</b>

20:01.500 --> 20:03.530
<b>Within the next few hours,</b>

20:04.750 --> 20:06.350
<b>the King will die!</b>

20:16.810 --> 20:18.280
<b>We need to go deeper...</b>

20:19.340 --> 20:23.950
<b>Yes, we must put her in a place 
where only we can find her.</b>

20:35.900 --> 20:37.230
<b>That should do it.</b>

20:38.420 --> 20:40.810
<b>All that's left is to negotiate,</b>

20:41.580 --> 20:45.380
<b>without going far enough to make the King snap.</b>

20:49.770 --> 20:50.790
<b>I know...</b>

20:52.780 --> 20:55.250
<b>What we're doing is cruel.</b>

21:02.680 --> 21:06.210
<b>We are no different from them.</b>

21:06.660 --> 21:07.530
<b>No...</b>

21:08.770 --> 21:10.330
<b>We are far worse!</b>

21:30.600 --> 21:33.350
<b><i>Pitou... Pitou...</i></b>

21:33.930 --> 21:35.310
<b><i>Where are you?</i></b>

21:36.190 --> 21:37.940
<b><i>Pitou!</i></b>

23:25.050 --> 23:27.680
<b>Next time: The Word x Is x That Someone.</b>

23:28.570 --> 23:30.030
<b>And it isn't "Killua."</b>

23:30.750 --> 23:33.270
<b>And that's all there is to it.</b>
