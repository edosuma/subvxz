WEBVTT

00:02.803 --> 00:05.073
We're really excited to have
the kids stay with us

00:05.106 --> 00:07.575
while you guys are away
for a little grown-up time.

00:07.608 --> 00:08.642
Wink, wink.

00:08.676 --> 00:12.080
Ma, don't "wink, wink."

00:12.113 --> 00:14.082
You're gonna ruin grown-up time.

00:14.115 --> 00:16.350
Don't worry, honey,
I got some new lingerie.

00:16.384 --> 00:17.551
You'll power through.

00:19.120 --> 00:21.189
So, you're going
to Atlantic City.

00:21.222 --> 00:23.491
I've had some good times there
with your mother.

00:23.524 --> 00:26.026
I've never been to
Atlantic City, Joe.

00:27.395 --> 00:29.797
Well, some lucky lady.

00:29.830 --> 00:32.800
A-And it's not Atlantic City,
Dad, it's Vegas.

00:32.833 --> 00:34.602
I told you that ten minutes ago

00:34.635 --> 00:37.205
when you were complaining about
how tinfoil used to be thicker.

00:38.606 --> 00:39.640
Hi, Grandma. Hi, Grandpa.

00:39.673 --> 00:41.809
Oh, we are gonna have such fun
with these cuties.

00:41.842 --> 00:45.779
I have a candy bar at home
weighs more than you do.

00:45.813 --> 00:46.780
I love you, Grandma.

00:46.814 --> 00:48.182
Mwah.

00:48.216 --> 00:50.551
And we're hoping that Kate

00:50.584 --> 00:52.720
looks up from her phone
at some point.

00:52.753 --> 00:54.822
What?

00:54.855 --> 00:58.259
And we've got something special
planned for you, Teddy.

00:58.292 --> 01:01.629
I fixed up your dad's
old BB gun.

01:01.662 --> 01:03.264
You better sleep
with one eye open.

01:03.297 --> 01:06.834
I've got a video of you singing
"Let It Go" in your towel.

01:11.139 --> 01:13.207
A BB gun for Teddy?

01:13.241 --> 01:14.875
Oh, don't worry,
my dad's a great teacher.

01:14.908 --> 01:17.145
Don and I both had 'em
when we were kids.

01:17.178 --> 01:19.213
Oh, yeah, I taught my boys
how to shoot the Army way.

01:19.247 --> 01:20.548
Safety first.

01:20.581 --> 01:22.216
Unless you're being
overrun by Charlie,

01:22.250 --> 01:24.852
then it's just
spray and pray.

01:24.885 --> 01:27.121
But Teddy's so young.

01:27.155 --> 01:29.223
But it's a Burns
family tradition.

01:29.257 --> 01:31.559
Three generations of men
sharing knowledge

01:31.592 --> 01:34.895
and history
and companionship.

01:34.928 --> 01:37.631
That's the kind
of emotional crap you love.

01:37.665 --> 01:41.235
I do love emotional crap.

01:42.903 --> 01:45.206
Okay, well, just be careful.

01:45.239 --> 01:46.840
All right, you better
get out of here

01:46.874 --> 01:49.743
before she changes her mind.
Yeah.

01:49.777 --> 01:51.579
Okay, honey, bye-bye.
Bye-bye.

01:51.612 --> 01:53.147
Mwah.

01:53.181 --> 01:55.183
So...

01:55.216 --> 01:58.186
tell me more about this
girl from Atlantic City.

01:58.219 --> 02:01.555
Honey, don't worry
about who else played the game.

02:01.589 --> 02:03.257
You won the prize.

02:07.628 --> 02:10.264
I'm looking forward to teaching
your boy how to shoot.

02:10.298 --> 02:12.166
Once Teddy learns
how to use a BB gun,

02:12.200 --> 02:13.467
I'll show him my real guns.

02:13.501 --> 02:15.936
Okay, bye, Dad,
yup, night-night.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.405
Okay.

02:17.438 --> 02:19.173
Drive safe.

02:19.207 --> 02:22.910
Off you go.

02:22.943 --> 02:24.412
Wait-wait-wait,
wh

02:24.445 --> 02:26.180
Oh, nothing, just some
old guy jibber-jab.

02:26.214 --> 02:27.215
Nothing to worry about.

02:27.248 --> 02:31.285
Wait, wait, wait.
H

02:31.319 --> 02:31.919
I can't believe

02:31.952 --> 02:33.254
you never told me that.

02:33.287 --> 02:34.688
Honey, my dad hunts,
he's a vet.

02:34.722 --> 02:36.424
I figured you knew.
I'm gonna go in here now.

02:36.457 --> 02:40.661
Oh, I'm gonna go
in here, too.

02:40.694 --> 02:43.297
Look, our kids are
over there a lot.

02:43.331 --> 02:44.932
Yeah, and think
how safe they are

02:44.965 --> 02:47.801
being protected
by all those guns.

02:47.835 --> 02:51.272
Look, when Kate was born, you
got rid of your hunting rifles.

02:51.305 --> 02:54.942
I just... I don't understand why
people insist on having guns.

02:54.975 --> 02:58.279
That's 'cause no one as smart as
me has ever explained it to you.

02:58.312 --> 03:00.481
Okay?

03:00.514 --> 03:03.351
People say it's about
their rights and their freedom,

03:03.384 --> 03:06.820
but here's the real truth:
guns are fun.

03:08.256 --> 03:11.225
They go boom, people like that.

03:11.259 --> 03:12.460
But they're dangerous.

03:12.493 --> 03:14.528
In the hands of idiots.

03:14.562 --> 03:15.563
But the fact that you

03:15.596 --> 03:17.298
never even knew my dad had 'em

03:17.331 --> 03:19.533
proves how careful
and safe he is.

03:19.567 --> 03:21.969
I think it just proves
that you never told me.

03:23.404 --> 03:25.373
It can prove two things.

03:25.406 --> 03:29.009
I'm sorry, I'm-I'm
just not comfortable

03:29.042 --> 03:30.611
leaving the kids there.

03:30.644 --> 03:33.247
I just-- I-I won't be able
to enjoy myself in Vegas.

03:33.281 --> 03:36.284
No, no, no,
leave Vegas out of this.

03:36.317 --> 03:39.019
We've had to cancel
this trip three times.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.789
Okay, well, then
talk to your dad

03:41.822 --> 03:44.258
about getting rid of
his guns and we can go.

03:44.292 --> 03:46.727
If you feel so
strongly about it,

03:46.760 --> 03:48.296
maybe you should
talk to my dad.

03:48.329 --> 03:51.265
Okay.

03:51.299 --> 03:54.402
Yeah, I'll tell your dad
to get rid of his guns.

03:54.435 --> 03:56.937
You can tell my mom she has
to start wearing a bra.

03:59.540 --> 04:01.975
I'll take the guns.

04:02.009 --> 04:04.912
If she's not gonna listen to the
manager at the Golden Corral,

04:04.945 --> 04:06.347
she's not gonna
listen to me.

04:08.416 --> 04:10.418
*

04:19.393 --> 04:21.028
So here's the thing, Dad.

04:21.061 --> 04:23.030
I had a talk with Andi,

04:23.063 --> 04:25.899
and you need to get rid
of your guns.

04:28.602 --> 04:31.038
Your wife is
very funny, yeah.
Yeah.

04:31.071 --> 04:33.040
Yeah, she's a hoot.

04:33.073 --> 04:35.976
But after you brought up
your real guns last night,

04:36.009 --> 04:36.944
Andi got all worried

04:36.977 --> 04:38.879
about the kids staying
with you guys next week.

04:38.912 --> 04:40.948
Oh, geez. No one's
more careful than me.

04:40.981 --> 04:44.385
I told her, but there's talk
of calling off Vegas.

04:44.418 --> 04:46.887
Okay, I need to play
blackjack in a hotel robe,

04:46.920 --> 04:49.056
holding a morning beer.
I need it, Dad.

04:49.089 --> 04:51.058
All right, all right.

04:51.091 --> 04:53.060
Look, I think Andi
just doesn't like guns

04:53.093 --> 04:54.928
because she's
never shot one.

04:54.962 --> 04:56.464
That's what I was thinking.

04:56.497 --> 04:58.499
So how about we take her
to the shooting range?

04:58.532 --> 05:00.934
She can see how responsible you
are, and we can change her mind.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.102
Oh, I like it.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.037
Okay, good.
By the way,

05:04.071 --> 05:05.873
how many times have you actually

05:05.906 --> 05:08.041
changed her mind
about something?

05:08.075 --> 05:11.011
I don't know, who keeps track
of that stuff?

05:11.044 --> 05:13.814
Zero's not a hard number
to remember.

05:19.119 --> 05:22.423
Who can say
fresh radishes?

05:22.456 --> 05:24.358
You don't have to say it,
I'll just give you some.

05:24.392 --> 05:26.427
I grew them in
my garden. Have one.

05:26.460 --> 05:28.729
No, thanks.
I don't try new things.

05:28.762 --> 05:30.631
Don, we've talked about this,

05:30.664 --> 05:32.433
it's good to broaden
your horizons.

05:32.466 --> 05:34.668
Well, actually, Lowell,
in 99% of deaths,

05:34.702 --> 05:36.136
you'll find out
that the deceased,

05:36.169 --> 05:38.906
at some point,
tried something new.

05:38.939 --> 05:41.642
But everybody
tries something new.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.343
And everybody dies.

05:45.413 --> 05:47.014
You got any tomatoes
in that man basket?

05:47.047 --> 05:48.382
I know I like those.

05:48.416 --> 05:49.450
Well, I planted some,

05:49.483 --> 05:51.619
but I've got a thieving
woodchuck in my garden.

05:51.652 --> 05:53.687
I tried to have
my cat chase him off,

05:53.721 --> 05:55.656
but they became
unlikely animal friends.

05:55.689 --> 05:58.992
You know, my dad fixed up
Adam's old BB gun.

05:59.026 --> 06:01.729
How about you and I go out
and take care of that woodchuck?

06:01.762 --> 06:03.764
Scarface style.

06:05.566 --> 06:07.635
I don't like this place.

06:07.668 --> 06:09.637
And why are people
wearing camouflage inside?

06:09.670 --> 06:10.871
It just makes them
more obvious.

06:10.904 --> 06:12.606
I can see all of you!

06:12.640 --> 06:15.776
Honey, don't rile up
the gun owners.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.012
Just relax.

06:19.046 --> 06:21.181
Okay, once you
fire off a few rounds,

06:21.214 --> 06:23.717
I think you'll see it's
not as scary as it seems.

06:23.751 --> 06:24.552
Ready?
All right.

06:24.585 --> 06:27.421
Let's go over a few
safety rules, huh?

06:27.455 --> 06:30.624
Always assume that
every gun is loaded.

06:30.658 --> 06:31.892
Is that one loaded?

06:31.925 --> 06:33.661
What did I just say?

06:33.694 --> 06:35.729
She's not listening.

06:35.763 --> 06:38.198
Trust me, Dad, that's not
how you do it with her.

06:38.231 --> 06:40.768
It's true. It's not how
you do it with me.

06:40.801 --> 06:42.870
All right, you want
to go give this a try?

06:42.903 --> 06:44.137
Well, if it gets me off

06:44.171 --> 06:46.740
the set of Deliverance,
I'll do it.

06:46.774 --> 06:48.676
Okay, fire when ready.

06:53.981 --> 06:57.785
Well that's just
the best thing ever.

06:59.820 --> 07:01.889
I've seen you eat
carrots before,

07:01.922 --> 07:03.491
so I know you'll like these.

07:03.524 --> 07:06.159
I want the last thing that
woodchuck sees to be us enjoying

07:06.193 --> 07:08.596
what is rightfully ours!

07:09.597 --> 07:11.064
Got any ranch dressing?

07:11.098 --> 07:12.733
I do.

07:14.868 --> 07:15.969
Can I have some?

07:16.003 --> 07:18.539
You may not.
Just try one without it.

07:18.572 --> 07:20.841
Why are you always
looking to change me?

07:20.874 --> 07:22.843
It's like when you wanted me
to see movies

07:22.876 --> 07:24.978
that aren't Fast & Furious.

07:25.012 --> 07:27.681
There are better movies.
Branch out.

07:27.715 --> 07:28.682
There aren't better movies.

07:28.716 --> 07:30.851
They made eight and the
worst one was good.

07:30.884 --> 07:32.152
It went great, great, great,

07:32.185 --> 07:34.755
good, great, great,
better, best.

07:34.788 --> 07:38.191
Of course you love it-- it's
the ranch dressing of movies.

07:40.594 --> 07:44.097
Shh, look, there's
the woodchuck.

07:44.131 --> 07:47.735
That's right, just sit there
and eat that tomato.

07:47.768 --> 07:50.771
Oh, no, my cat!

07:50.804 --> 07:52.172
Ow!

07:52.205 --> 07:55.876
You shot me in the butt!

07:55.909 --> 07:59.146
No, I didn't.
I was at work all day.

08:03.183 --> 08:05.786
But I don't want to go home.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.755
Babe, we've been
here two hours.

08:07.788 --> 08:09.890
You can't go full Rambo
on the first day.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.125
Okay.

08:12.159 --> 08:13.994
But first let me check out
the gift counter.

08:14.027 --> 08:16.296
They have a-a pepper grinder
that looks like a hand grenade.

08:16.329 --> 08:18.666
How do I not have one of those?

08:18.699 --> 08:22.102
All right, looks like
Atlantic City is back on.

08:22.135 --> 08:24.004
I told you it's Vegas.

08:24.037 --> 08:27.140
Whoa, Dad, you just put
your phone in the gun case.

08:27.174 --> 08:29.877
What?
Were you about to put
the gun in your pocket?

08:29.910 --> 08:32.646
Don't worry about
what I put where.

08:32.680 --> 08:33.513
Well, I'm just saying,

08:33.547 --> 08:35.115
if someone calls
and you answer your gun,

08:35.148 --> 08:36.183
we're gonna have a problem.

08:36.216 --> 08:37.918
I can't see in here

08:37.951 --> 08:40.654
because they're using those
global warming light bulbs.

08:40.688 --> 08:44.024
We're all walking around in the
dark to save some salamander.

08:45.158 --> 08:48.762
Saddle up, boys,

08:48.796 --> 08:50.698
I got to stop by the butcher.

08:50.731 --> 08:51.965
I want to eat something
for dinner

08:51.999 --> 08:53.567
that was walking around
yesterday.

08:57.705 --> 08:59.306
I'm not so sure
about Vegas.

08:59.339 --> 09:01.875
What? But I was really impressed
with your dad.

09:01.909 --> 09:03.811
I don't have any problem
with the kids staying there.

09:03.844 --> 09:04.945
He knows what he's doing.

09:04.978 --> 09:06.814
I used to think
that, too.

09:06.847 --> 09:10.150
Back at the range, he got
his gun and his phone mixed up.

09:10.183 --> 09:12.252
I've never seen him do
anything like that.

09:12.285 --> 09:14.622
Well, I mean,
maybe he-he just got confused.

09:14.655 --> 09:16.857
I mean,
that place was thrilling.

09:17.825 --> 09:18.792
Things got crazy.

09:18.826 --> 09:21.228
I didn't even pay for this hat.

09:21.261 --> 09:23.797
It's more than that.
I've been noticing stuff.

09:23.831 --> 09:25.899
He keeps thinking
we're going to Atlantic City.

09:25.933 --> 09:27.835
Like he's lost a step.

09:27.868 --> 09:30.003
I can't believe I'm saying
this, but I don't think

09:30.037 --> 09:31.839
he should have guns
around the house anymore.

09:31.872 --> 09:34.241
And I have to be the
jerk that tells him.

09:34.274 --> 09:36.143
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

09:36.176 --> 09:38.145
Hey, you talk to my dad,

09:38.178 --> 09:40.714
and I will wrestle your mother
into that bra.

09:40.748 --> 09:42.950
Yeah, now that I think about it,

09:42.983 --> 09:44.284
I think it might be awkward

09:44.317 --> 09:46.720
for you to force underwear
on my mom.

09:46.754 --> 09:48.288
Yeah.

09:48.321 --> 09:50.824
And I think you're the one
that has to talk to your dad.

09:50.858 --> 09:52.660
I know.

09:52.693 --> 09:54.194
Poor guy.

09:54.227 --> 09:57.798
I just... I hate
to hit him with this.

09:57.831 --> 10:00.333
Well, hey, there is
a silver lining.

10:00.367 --> 10:02.970
I mean, if you handle this now,
then you won't get shot

10:03.003 --> 10:04.772
when it's time
to take away his car keys.

10:12.345 --> 10:14.381
So, here's
the thing, Dad.

10:14.414 --> 10:15.949
I had another talk with Andi,

10:15.983 --> 10:18.986
and you need to get rid
of your guns.

10:20.453 --> 10:22.422
That's still a
classic. Yeah.

10:22.455 --> 10:24.391
You're not laughing.

10:24.424 --> 10:26.293
This time I'm serious.

10:26.326 --> 10:28.128
That thing at the range,
with your cell phone,

10:28.161 --> 10:29.763
that freaked me out.

10:29.797 --> 10:31.398
Oh, you were always
easily startled.

10:31.431 --> 10:33.934
Oh, that's true. He used to hate
his jack-in-the-box.

10:33.967 --> 10:36.904
Crank, crank, crank, cry.

10:36.937 --> 10:40.407
You know I'm right. That thing
at the range bothered you, too.

10:40.440 --> 10:42.442
Well, you're not
taking my guns.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.712
I have a constitutional
right to defend myself.

10:44.745 --> 10:45.645
From what?

10:45.679 --> 10:47.815
Snowflakes like you trying
to take my guns.

10:49.249 --> 10:51.318
Everybody eventually
slips a little.

10:51.351 --> 10:53.153
It's happening to me, too.

10:53.186 --> 10:54.722
I tried jumping rope with Emme,

10:54.755 --> 10:56.289
I almost had to go
to the hospital.

10:56.323 --> 10:58.191
Well, I won't do it.

10:58.225 --> 11:00.694
I've already given up
everything else worth having.

11:00.728 --> 11:04.031
Fried food,
hard liquor, tobacco.

11:04.064 --> 11:05.365
And that's the holy trinity.

11:05.398 --> 11:07.234
Ma, help me out here.

11:07.267 --> 11:09.102
She's not gonna
help you on this.

11:09.136 --> 11:11.204
Actually, I agree with Adam.

11:11.238 --> 11:12.239
Bev.

11:12.272 --> 11:14.241
Joe, y-you accidentally left me

11:14.274 --> 11:16.209
at the Kmart last week.

11:16.243 --> 11:19.312
Why are you assuming
that was an accident?

11:20.113 --> 11:21.882
Look, I'm sorry,
Dad, but...

11:21.915 --> 11:24.718
either give me the guns,
or...

11:24.752 --> 11:27.087
or the kids can't come
over here anymore.

11:27.120 --> 11:29.256
Well, then, that's how
it's gonna be.

11:29.289 --> 11:31.925
Wait, wait, we don't
get the kids now?

11:31.959 --> 11:33.927
Look, forget what I said.
Your dad's fine.

11:33.961 --> 11:35.295
Stop being a snowflake.

11:35.328 --> 11:37.430
Really, Dad?

11:37.464 --> 11:38.799
That's your choice?

11:38.832 --> 11:40.100
You heard me.

11:40.133 --> 11:42.803
All right, then,
I guess I'm leaving.

11:42.836 --> 11:44.304
Good.

11:44.337 --> 11:47.240
Try not to get scared by a
clown in a box on your way out.

11:48.241 --> 11:50.410
That thing is not a toy.

11:50.443 --> 11:53.013
It's a horror movie
with a handle.

11:56.817 --> 12:00.187
I can't believe
you tattled to my wife.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.089
Don, why would you shoot him?

12:02.122 --> 12:04.357
I thought you liked this one.

12:04.391 --> 12:05.358
It was an accident.

12:05.392 --> 12:07.260
Or was it? I think he was mad

12:07.294 --> 12:09.062
because I wouldn't give him
ranch dressing.

12:09.096 --> 12:10.864
Which is a child's condiment.

12:10.898 --> 12:13.333
Oh, you've got to give Don
his ranch, Lowell.

12:13.366 --> 12:15.903
How's he gonna eat?

12:15.936 --> 12:17.470
You owe me an apology.

12:17.504 --> 12:19.372
You really think
I shot you on purpose?

12:19.406 --> 12:22.075
That is very hurtful.

12:22.109 --> 12:24.244
Is it as hurtful as being hit
by a hunk of metal

12:24.277 --> 12:27.314
flying through the air
at 900 miles an hour?

12:27.347 --> 12:30.017
Well, I can't say, because
I've never been dumb enough

12:30.050 --> 12:31.551
to step in front of one.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.353
So that's a no on the apology.

12:33.386 --> 12:35.422
Fine. If you'll excuse me,

12:35.455 --> 12:38.058
I'm going to leave
while I still have my dignity.

12:38.091 --> 12:42.362
Ow. Ow. Ow.

12:42.395 --> 12:44.464
Ow, Don.

13:02.082 --> 13:03.450
I'm sorry
about that.

13:03.483 --> 13:05.886
But one day
you're gonna be better

13:05.919 --> 13:07.420
at this than me,
and I'll be okay with that.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.923
It's just the natural order
of things, okay?

13:14.527 --> 13:16.429
I win.

13:17.530 --> 13:20.100
Wow, it happens sooner
than you think.

13:21.334 --> 13:22.302
Don't worry.

13:22.335 --> 13:24.204
You can still beat Teddy.

13:27.407 --> 13:30.343
Hey.
Hey.

13:30.377 --> 13:31.311
I talked to your mom today.

13:31.344 --> 13:33.613
Your dad's still pretty
bent out of shape.

13:33.646 --> 13:36.049
He turned the hose on some
Mormons that came by,

13:36.083 --> 13:37.584
but not even that
cheered him up.

13:39.419 --> 13:40.453
Maybe you should
go over there...

13:40.487 --> 13:42.856
No, no, no, no, no.

13:42.890 --> 13:44.257
See, this is what my dad does.

13:44.291 --> 13:46.259
He acts out, then I feel guilty,

13:46.293 --> 13:48.061
and you always make me
go over there and talk to him.

13:48.095 --> 13:49.362
I'm not doing it this time.

13:49.396 --> 13:51.064
I don't always do that.

13:51.932 --> 13:54.201
Sometimes your mom does it.

13:54.234 --> 13:55.335
And I've been thinking about it.

13:55.368 --> 13:56.904
We're still going to Vegas.

13:56.937 --> 13:58.505
But who's gonna watch the kids?

13:58.538 --> 13:59.907
Well, we'll bring 'em along.

13:59.940 --> 14:01.208
We'll find someone
to watch 'em there.

14:01.241 --> 14:02.876
You can pay a woman
to do anything in Vegas.

14:04.177 --> 14:06.313
Hi, Adam.

14:06.346 --> 14:07.948
Oh, here comes the other one.
I don't care how mad he is,

14:07.981 --> 14:09.416
I'm not going over there.

14:09.449 --> 14:11.451
I just came to tell you
I've got your dad's guns

14:11.484 --> 14:13.086
in the trunk of my car.

14:13.120 --> 14:14.254
Seriously?

14:14.287 --> 14:15.956
Is Dad in there, too?

14:18.291 --> 14:20.994
H-He's not gonna pop out
like a jack

14:21.028 --> 14:23.630
No, he gave them up.

14:23.663 --> 14:25.465
He said he realized
you're right,

14:25.498 --> 14:29.469
and he has to confront the
reality of getting older.

14:32.239 --> 14:34.474
What did he really say?

14:34.507 --> 14:36.643
He said "Get these damn
things out of my house,"

14:36.676 --> 14:38.478
and something about his son
being dead to him,

14:38.511 --> 14:40.580
but he could've been talking
about Don.

14:42.315 --> 14:44.184
Adam, are

14:44.217 --> 14:47.320
I mean, you changed
two people's minds this week.

14:47.354 --> 14:50.123
I actually think you might be
able to get that bra on my mom.

14:51.358 --> 14:53.393
It'd be great if you could do it

14:53.426 --> 14:54.527
before Thanksgiving.
I don't want

14:54.561 --> 14:56.563
my mashed potatoes ruined again.

14:58.198 --> 14:59.366
Honey, what's wrong?

14:59.399 --> 15:01.368
You don't look happy.
Eh...

15:01.401 --> 15:04.371
I know my dad. That couldn't
have been easy for him.

15:04.404 --> 15:08.408
Oh, if only he had someone
to talk it through with.

15:08.441 --> 15:11.511
Oh, interesting, Bev.
Mm-hmm.

15:13.613 --> 15:17.550
But who should it be?

15:17.584 --> 15:20.020
Nice show, ladies.

15:21.254 --> 15:22.990
All right. I'm going.

15:23.023 --> 15:26.994
If he squirts me with the hose,
I'm taking that away, too.

15:27.027 --> 15:29.296
DON:
Hey, Lowell.

15:29.329 --> 15:31.398
What brings you by?

15:31.431 --> 15:33.266
Is she gonna hold me down
while you finish me off,

15:33.300 --> 15:34.434
execution style?

15:36.636 --> 15:40.607
We're here because when my
husband's unhappy, I'm unhappy.

15:40.640 --> 15:42.142
So let's fix this.

15:42.175 --> 15:43.476
Okay? You think

15:43.510 --> 15:45.112
that Don shot you because

15:45.145 --> 15:46.579
on some deeper level,
he was mad at you.

15:46.613 --> 15:50.117
But I-I know from experience,
Don only has one level.

15:50.150 --> 15:53.653
That's true.
I'm an emotional pancake, baby.

15:55.022 --> 15:56.656
But he is sorry.
So to make things right,

15:56.689 --> 15:58.291
there's only one solution.

15:58.325 --> 15:59.326
Lowell,

15:59.359 --> 16:01.494
shoot Don in the butt.

16:01.528 --> 16:04.097
What? That's crazy.

16:04.131 --> 16:05.432
Look, you're my friend,

16:05.465 --> 16:06.733
and if this will
make things okay between us,

16:06.766 --> 16:09.069
then I'm willing
to turn the other cheek.

16:09.102 --> 16:11.471
And let you shoot me in it.

16:11.504 --> 16:15.008
Aw. You've never called me
your friend before.

16:15.042 --> 16:16.209
I'll do it.

16:16.243 --> 16:17.644
What?

16:17.677 --> 16:19.512
Marcy, you said
he wouldn't do it.

16:19.546 --> 16:21.181
No, Lowell,
this was just a gesture.

16:21.214 --> 16:24.084
I can't let you
shoot my husband.

16:24.117 --> 16:25.652
I won't. I just wanted
to scare him a little.

16:27.320 --> 16:28.588
How do you put this
thing on safety?

16:28.621 --> 16:30.423
DON:
Ow!

16:31.291 --> 16:33.526
Eh, he had it coming.

16:37.630 --> 16:39.032
Hey.

16:39.066 --> 16:40.267
Hey.

16:44.237 --> 16:47.107
I heard you had a little fun
with the hose earlier.

16:47.140 --> 16:49.109
You're not taking that away.

16:49.142 --> 16:51.611
That nozzle's the last thing
I have with a trigger.

16:53.113 --> 16:56.516
I was just looking out for you.

16:56.549 --> 16:59.586
Well, you weren't entirely, uh,

16:59.619 --> 17:03.690
100% completely... wrong.

17:03.723 --> 17:08.195
That might be the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

17:08.228 --> 17:09.762
Look, I'm not mad at you.

17:09.796 --> 17:11.164
I'm mad at time.

17:11.198 --> 17:12.599
You know,

17:12.632 --> 17:14.167
some day one of your kids

17:14.201 --> 17:16.569
is gonna show up
and take away your stuff.

17:16.603 --> 17:18.405
Oof, you're right.

17:18.438 --> 17:19.706
It'll probably be Emme.

17:19.739 --> 17:22.142
She just kicked my ass
at checkers.

17:22.175 --> 17:23.676
It didn't feel good, did it?

17:23.710 --> 17:25.612
No.

17:25.645 --> 17:29.249
But you know, there are some
upsides to getting older.

17:29.282 --> 17:30.683
Yeah? Name one.

17:30.717 --> 17:32.285
Uh...

17:35.355 --> 17:37.324
You can give anyone you want
the finger,

17:37.357 --> 17:39.692
and they won't try
and fight you.

17:39.726 --> 17:41.794
Yeah, I do enjoy that.

17:41.828 --> 17:44.564
Oh, and if you don't want
to talk to someone,

17:44.597 --> 17:46.399
you just pretend
you can't hear 'em.

17:46.433 --> 17:47.400
What'd you say?

17:47.434 --> 17:49.169
I said if you don't want to t...

17:50.570 --> 17:52.539
Nice.
Ah, I'm still funnier than you.

17:52.572 --> 17:55.542
Eh? And I can
shoot straighter, too.

17:55.575 --> 17:57.244
I know, Dad.

17:57.277 --> 17:59.612
Look, nothing's changed.

17:59.646 --> 18:00.847
Okay?

18:04.517 --> 18:08.755
You know, the toughest part
about this whole thing is...

18:08.788 --> 18:11.791
when I'm not sure what to do,
I ask you.

18:12.759 --> 18:14.794
But because this was about you,

18:14.827 --> 18:17.764
I had to do it on my own.

18:17.797 --> 18:19.599
That's why it went so poorly.

18:20.633 --> 18:22.469
You know,

18:22.502 --> 18:24.804
I just thought
of another upside:

18:24.837 --> 18:26.906
if you do things right,

18:26.939 --> 18:31.411
you raise a kid who cares enough
to really piss you off.

18:32.712 --> 18:34.747
And you are just full
of compliments today.

18:36.683 --> 18:39.486
Do I smell chicken,
or am I having a stroke?

18:39.519 --> 18:41.721
Oh, oh. You know, I figured,

18:41.754 --> 18:43.190
if you got to give something up,

18:43.223 --> 18:45.192
you should get
something back, right?

18:45.225 --> 18:47.827
Fried food,

18:47.860 --> 18:49.662
hard liquor....
Ah.

18:49.696 --> 18:50.863
...and tobacco.

18:50.897 --> 18:52.232
The holy trinity.
The holy trinity.

18:52.265 --> 18:54.234
Eh?

18:54.267 --> 18:55.868
Ah. Ooh.

18:55.902 --> 18:57.537
These are Cubans, huh?

18:57.570 --> 18:59.906
Those Commies know
how to roll a stogie.

18:59.939 --> 19:02.575
And Mom never has to know.

19:02.609 --> 19:03.910
Oh, she doesn't scare me.

19:03.943 --> 19:05.512
But we better crack a window.

19:05.545 --> 19:07.146
She's got guns now.

19:08.215 --> 19:09.782
I'm back, baby.

19:18.958 --> 19:22.595
All right, that's the guns
all locked up.

19:22.629 --> 19:24.864
Listen, Dad. If you ever
want to go shooting,

19:24.897 --> 19:27.400
I'd be happy to take you
to the range.
Sounds good.

19:27.434 --> 19:29.502
There's a great chicken joint
on that side of town.

19:29.536 --> 19:30.903
Ooh.
Okay, you can stop
with the whispering.

19:30.937 --> 19:32.572
I know about the fried chicken.

19:32.605 --> 19:34.407
Our house smells
like Colonel Sanders got drunk

19:34.441 --> 19:35.708
and caught on fire.

19:36.776 --> 19:37.777
Okay, Bev, so we'll drop

19:37.810 --> 19:39.246
the kids by Friday afternoon

19:39.279 --> 19:40.347
on our way to the airport?

19:40.380 --> 19:41.448
Oh, we won't be home then.

19:41.481 --> 19:42.482
It's been a
stressful week,

19:42.515 --> 19:45.618

19:45.652 --> 19:47.920

put me in the mood.

19:47.954 --> 19:51.491
What?
You take away my guns,
I take away your Vegas.
