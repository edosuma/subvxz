WEBVTT

00:03.738 --> 00:07.172
Eric:<i> Monica lee.</i>
<i> She's never lost a case.</i>

00:07.174 --> 00:08.273
Callen:<i> No lawyer puts together</i>
<i> a win streak like that</i>

00:08.275 --> 00:10.275
Without having
someone on the inside.

00:10.277 --> 00:12.343
Deeks had skills, but
he was never one of the guys.

00:12.345 --> 00:13.610
He never
fit in.

00:13.612 --> 00:15.311
The lapd

00:15.313 --> 00:16.645
Has decided
to open

00:16.647 --> 00:19.581
An investigation into you.

00:19.583 --> 00:21.749
Martin deeks?
Yeah, what's up?

00:21.751 --> 00:23.617
You're being arrested
for the murder of francis boyle.

00:23.619 --> 00:24.484
Deeks,
what is he

00:24.486 --> 00:25.251
Talking about?

00:25.253 --> 00:26.518
I love you.

00:31.457 --> 00:33.523
(indistinct chatter)

00:37.262 --> 00:38.628
(door buzzes)

00:41.265 --> 00:43.331
What's up, fellas?

00:48.170 --> 00:49.636
How's it going?

00:51.306 --> 00:53.372
(whirring, beeping)

01:03.417 --> 01:06.284
Turn to the right.

01:06.286 --> 01:08.352
Face me.

01:11.223 --> 01:12.355
(grunts)

01:12.357 --> 01:14.190
(scoffs)

01:14.192 --> 01:16.258
(exhales)

01:18.195 --> 01:21.196
Detective ellen whiting,
internal affairs.

01:21.198 --> 01:24.465
I thought rivera was leading
this witch hunt.

01:24.467 --> 01:27.067
Not anymore.

01:27.069 --> 01:30.136
Why? They decided to
give her a real case?

01:30.138 --> 01:33.205
Listen, now that the show
of parading me through here

01:33.207 --> 01:36.208
In cuffs is over, do you mind
if we get rid of these?

01:37.077 --> 01:39.177
You son of a bitch.
(shouts)

01:39.179 --> 01:39.777
Detective.

01:39.779 --> 01:42.212
(shouts)
(grunts)

01:42.214 --> 01:43.746
(grunts)
did you miss me?

01:43.748 --> 01:45.280
(groaning)

01:45.282 --> 01:48.316
If you killed my partner,
you're a dead man.

01:48.318 --> 01:49.617
Hey! Knock it off, steadman!

01:49.619 --> 01:51.619
Get your man
under control, lieutenant.

01:51.621 --> 01:54.355
Get him out of here! Now!

01:55.591 --> 01:59.192
Why is it that you bring trouble
wherever you go, deeks?

01:59.194 --> 02:01.327
I don't know.
I was born under a bad sign.

02:01.329 --> 02:02.661
Yeah. "out of order."

02:02.663 --> 02:05.830
That's a nice mustache,
lieutenant.

02:05.832 --> 02:09.099
You doing undercover work
in gay porn again?

02:10.402 --> 02:12.235
I didn't have to pull him
off you.

02:12.237 --> 02:13.469
That will be all,

02:13.471 --> 02:14.870
Lieutenant.

02:14.872 --> 02:17.339
(coughs)
I expect
to be kept

02:17.341 --> 02:19.407
In the loop.

02:21.344 --> 02:24.678
Well, looks like you got enemies

02:24.680 --> 02:27.514
Everywhere you go,
detective deeks.

02:27.516 --> 02:29.516
(panting)

02:29.518 --> 02:31.584
What can I say?

02:33.521 --> 02:35.721
It's good to be home.

02:35.723 --> 02:37.789
(chuckles)

02:39.726 --> 02:41.726
¶ ¶

03:00.312 --> 03:03.179
Any word on deeks?

03:03.181 --> 03:04.580
Nothing.
(sniffles)

03:04.582 --> 03:07.583
(chuckling):
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

03:07.585 --> 03:10.452
You slept here last night?

03:10.454 --> 03:11.586
Worked late.

03:11.588 --> 03:13.621
On what, lame excuses?

03:13.623 --> 03:15.623
Joelle kick you out
of your own house?

03:15.625 --> 03:17.591
Of course not.
I just couldn't sleep.

03:17.593 --> 03:18.792
'cause you were fighting.

03:18.794 --> 03:20.593
'cause I had a lot on my mind.

03:20.595 --> 03:23.929
Yeah. Hmm. What, you were trying
to think of places to sleep

03:23.931 --> 03:25.297
While she cooled off?

03:25.299 --> 03:27.299
You know that's
never a good idea.

03:27.301 --> 03:28.733
Just prolongs
the pain.

03:28.735 --> 03:29.900
You're better off apologizing

03:29.902 --> 03:31.534
And sorting it out
in the morning.

03:31.536 --> 03:32.468
Apologize for what?

03:32.470 --> 03:33.802
I-I didn't do
anything.

03:33.804 --> 03:35.670
You know, you are so smart,
so brave,

03:35.672 --> 03:38.472
And so utterly clueless
about women.

03:38.474 --> 03:40.841
Please, I know women, okay?

03:40.843 --> 03:43.210
Oh, yeah? That's why
you're sleeping on a couch.

03:43.212 --> 03:44.477
I happen to like this couch.

03:44.479 --> 03:46.745
I enjoy sleeping on this couch.

03:46.747 --> 03:48.747
Yeah? Well, it's good
you like that couch,

03:48.749 --> 03:50.548
Because you and that couch
are probably gonna be together

03:50.550 --> 03:53.384
A lot longer than any
of your relationships.

03:53.386 --> 03:57.721
Wow. That is so harsh, so early.

03:57.723 --> 03:59.723
It's reality, baby.

03:59.725 --> 04:02.525
(sighs)
I should probably cut her loose.

04:02.527 --> 04:04.727
Seems like the right thing
to do.

04:04.729 --> 04:07.396
(sighs)

04:07.398 --> 04:09.331
I like her.

04:09.333 --> 04:11.299
A lot.

04:11.301 --> 04:13.301
I know.

04:13.303 --> 04:14.835
It's not fair to her.

04:14.837 --> 04:17.370
This job is hard
on any relationship.

04:17.372 --> 04:19.572
Yeah, I tried.

04:20.541 --> 04:22.707
Cheer up, g.

04:22.709 --> 04:24.709
You'll always have me.

04:24.711 --> 04:26.377
I was hoping they're gonna
come up with a cure for that

04:26.379 --> 04:27.511
One of these days.

04:29.214 --> 04:31.214
Where's hetty?

04:31.216 --> 04:33.649
I don't know. I just got here.
What's happening with deeks?

04:33.651 --> 04:35.283
Lapd's internal affairs
are holding him

04:35.285 --> 04:37.285
On the murder charge,
and they won't let me see him.

04:37.287 --> 04:38.486
Granger:
Blye, I need you

04:38.488 --> 04:39.887
In the armory now.

04:40.856 --> 04:42.856
Just blye.

04:42.858 --> 04:44.757
We need to know
what's going on.

04:44.759 --> 04:46.759
You two needed to know
what was going on

04:46.761 --> 04:49.961
A hell of a lot sooner
than this.

04:51.764 --> 04:53.497
Kensi: They're saying
deeks killed a man

04:53.499 --> 04:54.965
Named francis boyle.

04:54.967 --> 04:57.500
Well, he was
briefly deeks' partner.

04:57.502 --> 04:59.602
Suspected of being a dirty cop.

04:59.604 --> 05:01.003
Did he ever talk to you
about him?

05:01.005 --> 05:02.738
Never by name.

05:02.740 --> 05:06.274
But he did mention a partner
that put a gun to his mouth once

05:06.276 --> 05:08.409
After deeks confronted him
about getting a confession

05:08.411 --> 05:11.245
Out of a suspect
with a pot of hot coffee.

05:11.247 --> 05:12.512
Good lord.

05:12.514 --> 05:14.680
He transferred
to undercover after that.

05:14.682 --> 05:16.648
He tell you
how boyle was killed?

05:16.650 --> 05:19.283
Shot with his own gun
by a hooker he'd beaten up.

05:21.553 --> 05:24.253
I'm sorry,
you don't believe him?

05:24.255 --> 05:26.255
Doesn't matter what we believe.

05:26.257 --> 05:28.490
It's what ia can prove.

05:28.492 --> 05:31.025
Drop everything

05:31.027 --> 05:34.628
And get detective deeks out
of this mess.

05:35.864 --> 05:39.031
Francis boyle was
an lapd veteran of 19 years

05:39.033 --> 05:40.900
And detective third class

05:40.901 --> 05:42.768
When deeks was assigned to him
as a partner.

05:42.770 --> 05:45.704
He's got a lot of reprimands
and complaints in his file.

05:45.706 --> 05:47.572
Well, he came through
the department at a time

05:47.574 --> 05:49.974
When accountability wasn't
considered important.

05:49.976 --> 05:53.410
This is boyle's former partner,
detective bruce steadman.

05:53.412 --> 05:54.677
He's still
on the force.

05:54.679 --> 05:56.879
His docket isn't
much better.

05:56.881 --> 05:58.413
The police department
split them up, hoping

05:58.415 --> 06:00.415
It would reduce
the problem.

06:00.417 --> 06:01.849
It didn't.

06:01.851 --> 06:03.650
Deeks said that francis
boyle had a reputation

06:03.652 --> 06:05.318
For beating up
prostitutes.

06:05.320 --> 06:07.320
Sounds like
he was asking for it.

06:07.322 --> 06:09.689
And yet deeks is getting charged
with the murder.

06:09.691 --> 06:11.590
Why now?

06:11.592 --> 06:13.758
New evidence pop up?
A new witness step forward?

06:13.760 --> 06:14.825
We don't know.

06:14.827 --> 06:16.860
But hetty wants us
to find out.

06:16.862 --> 06:19.462
Then let's find out.

06:21.766 --> 06:22.765
You good?

06:22.767 --> 06:25.801
Yeah, I'm good.

06:36.546 --> 06:37.945
You brought deeks here.

06:37.947 --> 06:40.614
Is there anything else
you want to tell us

06:40.616 --> 06:42.682
Before we dive into this?

06:43.551 --> 06:46.084
No.

06:46.086 --> 06:49.554
You're sure you want us
to do this?

06:49.556 --> 06:51.989
You don't want to help
detective deeks?

06:51.991 --> 06:53.790
Well, in order
to help detective deeks,

06:53.792 --> 06:56.793
We're gonna have
to look into this case.

06:56.795 --> 06:59.095
What if we don't like
what we find?

06:59.097 --> 07:02.364
The truth doesn't take sides,
mr. Callen.

07:02.366 --> 07:04.499
Only we do that.

07:08.605 --> 07:10.605
Whiting:
<i> How long were you partnered</i>

07:10.607 --> 07:11.606
With detective boyle?

07:11.608 --> 07:12.707
That should be
in my file.

07:12.709 --> 07:15.710
Can I get... A coffee?

07:15.712 --> 07:17.712
You requested
undercover work

07:17.714 --> 07:20.047
Almost immediately after
being partnered with him.

07:20.049 --> 07:21.415
Why?

07:21.417 --> 07:22.816
I don't like
wearing suits.

07:22.818 --> 07:26.786
You know, a cappuccino
would actually be lovely.

07:26.788 --> 07:28.621
Did you and boyle
have personal issues?

07:28.623 --> 07:30.623
Well, he listened
to a lot of nickelback.

07:30.625 --> 07:32.024
You filed two reports on him,

07:32.026 --> 07:34.092
The first involving
the treatment of a suspect

07:34.094 --> 07:37.095
And the other an incident
where he pulled his gun on you.

07:37.097 --> 07:39.363
Care to comment?

07:40.099 --> 07:42.566
I'd settle for an espresso.

07:42.568 --> 07:45.001
It's just been
such a long night.

07:45.003 --> 07:46.535
It has been a long night.

07:46.537 --> 07:48.537
And yet you still haven't asked
for a lawyer.

07:48.539 --> 07:49.804
Why is that?

07:49.806 --> 07:53.073
That's because I<i> am</i> a lawyer.

07:53.075 --> 07:55.642
I'm sure that's also in my file.

07:55.644 --> 07:57.510
Do you want to know
what I think?
Not particularly.

07:57.512 --> 07:59.712
Of course you do.
That's why you're still here.

07:59.714 --> 08:02.047
This whole act of yours is just
your way of trying to figure out

08:02.049 --> 08:05.050
What we've got on you. And the
only reason why you'd do that

08:05.052 --> 08:08.119
Is if you had something truly

08:08.121 --> 08:10.020
You were trying to hide.

08:10.022 --> 08:12.088
(chuckling softly)

08:32.576 --> 08:34.176
Yes?

08:34.177 --> 08:35.777
How is it that steadman
is still on the force?

08:35.779 --> 08:37.812
He's clearly a bad dude.

08:37.814 --> 08:40.848
Lapd could never pin anything
on him, I guess.

08:40.850 --> 08:42.449
You know what, I bet...
(beeping)

08:42.451 --> 08:43.616
Uh-oh.

08:43.618 --> 08:45.751
What?
Remember this guy?

08:45.753 --> 08:49.087
Yes. Former internal affairs
detective john quinn.

08:49.089 --> 08:52.423
We busted him for selling guns
to white supremacists.

08:52.425 --> 08:54.858
So, wait, what's the uh-oh?

08:55.627 --> 08:58.794
He escaped from jail
36 hours ago.

08:58.796 --> 09:00.629
He and deeks
were buddies.

09:00.631 --> 09:01.997
Deeks put him away.

09:01.999 --> 09:04.866
Quinn escapes
and deeks is locked up?

09:04.868 --> 09:06.200
Coincidence?

09:06.202 --> 09:08.035
I think not.

09:09.905 --> 09:12.171
I don't see a connection
between quinn's escape

09:12.173 --> 09:13.639
And deeks' arrest.

09:13.641 --> 09:15.641
Yeah, well, according
to the prison report,

09:15.643 --> 09:17.109
Quinn just got
jumped in the yard

09:17.111 --> 09:18.944
By a bunch of other
inmates recently.

09:18.946 --> 09:20.946
Prison is never enjoyable,

09:20.948 --> 09:22.914
Especially
if you're a dirty cop.

09:22.916 --> 09:24.649
(sighs)

09:24.651 --> 09:27.718
Maybe ia thinks that deeks
knows where quinn might go.

09:27.720 --> 09:30.187
Okay, so you pick up a phone--
you don't arrest him for murder.

09:30.189 --> 09:32.756
We're missing something here.

09:32.758 --> 09:34.624
If detective boyle is as dirty
as deeks says,

09:34.626 --> 09:36.559
He had to have been investigated
by quinn.

09:36.561 --> 09:38.761
Well, if quinn is a piece of
this puzzle, we got to find him.

09:38.763 --> 09:41.029
Quinn's lawyer was monica lee,

09:41.031 --> 09:43.564
And she was disbarred for
helping out the same arms dealer

09:43.566 --> 09:45.699
That was working with quinn.

09:45.700 --> 09:47.833
She testified against the
arms dealer to avoid jail time.

09:47.836 --> 09:49.101
If quinn's on the run,
there's a good chance

09:49.103 --> 09:50.769
He's gonna go to her for help.

09:50.771 --> 09:52.771
(phone rings)

09:52.773 --> 09:55.106
Oh, my gosh. It's deeks.
He's home.

09:55.108 --> 09:56.107
Deeks.

09:56.109 --> 09:57.808
No, it's roberta.

09:57.810 --> 09:59.810
They're tearing the place apart.

09:59.812 --> 10:02.779
And when I asked 'em to stop,
they said they had a warrant.

10:02.781 --> 10:05.782
Okay. All right, mrs. Deeks.
Slow down. Who's at the house?

10:05.784 --> 10:07.850
The police. At least they said
they were the police.

10:07.852 --> 10:09.184
But I told them...

10:09.186 --> 10:11.686
My son is a cop!

10:11.688 --> 10:13.621
Okay, mrs. Deeks,
I need you to calm down.

10:13.623 --> 10:14.855
I'm gonna come over
right now, okay?

10:14.857 --> 10:16.857
Hurry.
All right, bye.

10:16.859 --> 10:18.725
Ia is at deeks' house.

10:18.727 --> 10:19.926
Go deal
with that.

10:19.928 --> 10:23.062
We'll pay monica
lee a visit.

10:23.064 --> 10:24.730
(slurps)

10:24.732 --> 10:27.065
(groans)

10:27.067 --> 10:29.133
(slurping)

10:29.135 --> 10:30.934
(groans)

10:30.936 --> 10:32.635
Really?

10:32.637 --> 10:34.236
Is that all
you got left, deeks?

10:34.238 --> 10:36.238
You're about as defiant
as my eight-year-old.

10:36.240 --> 10:37.772
Wow.
You have kids?

10:37.774 --> 10:39.840
Whew. Did not see that coming,
mommie dearest.

10:39.842 --> 10:41.041
Hey, uh, quick question--

10:41.043 --> 10:43.643
Are we sure this coffee
was made this week?

10:43.645 --> 10:45.244
We found new dna evidence
that places you

10:45.246 --> 10:46.912
In the hotel room
where boyle was killed.

10:46.914 --> 10:49.214
Well, that makes sense, since
I stayed there for a week

10:49.216 --> 10:50.815
While my house was being tented.

10:50.817 --> 10:52.650
We can play this
however you want,

10:52.652 --> 10:54.551
But you're not going anywhere
until you tell me

10:54.553 --> 10:55.818
Why you killed boyle.

10:55.820 --> 10:57.286
I didn't.
Then who did?

10:57.288 --> 10:59.187
Not my case.
I'm so confused by this.

10:59.189 --> 11:01.122
Isn't it your department's job
to find the killer?

11:01.124 --> 11:02.590
We did.

11:02.592 --> 11:04.692
And he's sitting
right across from me.
Wow.

11:04.694 --> 11:06.344
Buzz, wrong answer.

11:06.345 --> 11:07.995
Would you like to try other
terrible theories for 1,000?

11:07.997 --> 11:10.263
If you didn't kill boyle,
who did? Give me a name.

11:10.265 --> 11:12.064
(sighs)

11:14.535 --> 11:16.601
Kopi luwak.

11:17.770 --> 11:19.069
Who's that?
Never heard of him.

11:19.071 --> 11:20.537
It's indonesian.

11:20.539 --> 11:21.771
There's this monkey over there--

11:21.773 --> 11:23.205
Maybe it's a squirrel
or a rabbit--

11:23.207 --> 11:25.040
It's not important.
But what happens is that

11:25.042 --> 11:27.142
This monkey eats
these coffee cherries

11:27.144 --> 11:28.877
Even though it can't
properly digest 'em,

11:28.879 --> 11:30.879
So it goes all the way through
the intestinal track, right?

11:30.881 --> 11:33.748
And some genius decided he's
gonna collect these cherries

11:33.750 --> 11:35.616
And make it into
coffee, you know?

11:35.618 --> 11:36.883
All of a sudden
it's a delicacy.

11:36.885 --> 11:38.851
It's selling for $500 a pound,

11:38.853 --> 11:42.187
Which is essentially
just monkey poop coffee, right?

11:42.189 --> 11:45.190
And I've tried that coffee.
And that coffee's terrible.

11:45.192 --> 11:47.825
But even that coffee
is better than this coffee.

11:47.827 --> 11:51.261
The moral of the story is,
you need a french press.

11:51.263 --> 11:53.896
So...

11:53.898 --> 11:55.597
This has been fun,

11:55.599 --> 11:56.998
But I'm tired and I'm bored

11:57.000 --> 11:59.600
And you have nothing
and I have work to do, so, uh...

11:59.602 --> 12:01.134
(grunts)
good night and good luck.

12:01.136 --> 12:02.602
If you could just, uh,

12:02.604 --> 12:05.805
Help me with this.
Hello?

12:05.807 --> 12:06.839
Don't you get it?

12:06.841 --> 12:08.173
Don't I get what?

12:08.175 --> 12:10.041
You're not
going anywhere, deeks.

12:10.043 --> 12:11.909
I already spoke
to judge danzette.

12:11.911 --> 12:13.944
Dumbass danzette?
Hmm, yeah, well,

12:13.946 --> 12:15.812
He agrees you're a flight risk.

12:15.814 --> 12:17.280
You're being denied bail.

12:17.282 --> 12:19.649
Is it me, or it's just

12:19.651 --> 12:21.851
A lot of sexual tension
in this room?

12:21.853 --> 12:23.519
Keep it up.

12:23.520 --> 12:25.186
Gonna joke your way
right into a lethal injection.

12:25.189 --> 12:28.790
Can't be worse than the coffee.

12:28.792 --> 12:30.858
I want my phone call.

12:38.900 --> 12:41.834
You clock the guy in the suv?
Mm-hmm.

12:41.836 --> 12:45.304
Looks like someone else is
keeping an eye on monica lee.

12:45.306 --> 12:47.372
Internal affairs?

12:48.875 --> 12:50.674
(shutter clicks)

12:51.943 --> 12:54.009
Hopefully eric can find out.

12:56.279 --> 12:57.945
I probably should
have come alone.

12:57.947 --> 12:59.346
Why's that?

12:59.348 --> 13:00.847
Well, you're
intimidating.

13:00.849 --> 13:02.915
Excuse me?

13:02.917 --> 13:05.217
You look like you're here
to crash through her door, okay?

13:05.219 --> 13:07.986
I look like, you know,
the boy next door.

13:07.988 --> 13:08.987
(knocking)

13:08.989 --> 13:11.222
20 years ago, maybe.

13:11.224 --> 13:14.391
You're a sullen loner
who keeps to himself.

13:14.393 --> 13:17.127
That's the classic description
of every serial killer.

13:17.129 --> 13:18.862
How come I slept on the couch
last night

13:18.864 --> 13:20.096
But you're the grumpy one?

13:20.098 --> 13:22.832
Oh, right, you're married.

13:22.834 --> 13:24.834
(knocking)
keep it up.

13:26.637 --> 13:27.936
What do you two want?

13:27.938 --> 13:31.072
We're looking
for john quinn, monica.

13:31.074 --> 13:32.973
Quinn's in jail.

13:32.975 --> 13:34.941
Is that why you answered the
door with a gun in your hand?

13:34.943 --> 13:37.076
Can we come in?
Not without a warrant.

13:37.078 --> 13:40.846
Now get lost before I call
the police or mistakenly

13:40.848 --> 13:42.881
Shoot you two as prowlers.

13:45.652 --> 13:47.118
Well, she looks good.

13:47.120 --> 13:48.919
She looks scared.
(short chuckle)

13:48.921 --> 13:50.987
Like I said,
you're intimidating.

13:54.025 --> 13:56.925
(phone rings)

13:56.927 --> 13:58.259
Hello?

13:58.261 --> 13:59.660
Hey, it's me.

13:59.662 --> 14:01.028
Hi, baby, where are you?

14:01.030 --> 14:02.896
I'm in lockup.
This is my one phone call.

14:02.898 --> 14:04.114
I'm being held without bail

14:04.115 --> 14:05.331
'cause they think
I'm a flight risk.

14:05.333 --> 14:06.765
Are you kidding me?
That's ridiculous.

14:06.767 --> 14:08.834
Yeah.

14:08.835 --> 14:10.902
Okay, listen, did they
ask you about john quinn?

14:10.904 --> 14:13.371
Quinn? No, why?

14:13.373 --> 14:15.939
He escaped from prison.

14:19.010 --> 14:20.275
Deeks?

14:20.277 --> 14:21.709
No, I'm here, I'm here.

14:21.711 --> 14:23.677
Okay, what is going on?

14:23.679 --> 14:25.045
I don't know.
I honestly don't know.

14:25.047 --> 14:27.847
Okay, well, ia is all over
your house right now.

14:27.849 --> 14:28.848
My house?

14:28.850 --> 14:30.633
Yes.

14:30.634 --> 14:32.417
I don't know what the hell they
think they're gonna find there.

14:32.420 --> 14:34.720
I don't know, but they're
tearing the place apart.

14:34.722 --> 14:36.555
All right, well, just keep an
eye on 'em, 'cause I wouldn't

14:36.556 --> 14:38.389
Put it past 'em to plant some
evidence. And please, kensi,

14:38.392 --> 14:40.425
Whatever you do,
do not tell my mother.

14:40.427 --> 14:41.926
Is that martin?

14:41.928 --> 14:43.394
Oh, you got to be kidding me.
Kensi.

14:43.396 --> 14:45.262
Martin,
don't worry, honey,

14:45.264 --> 14:47.464
We're gonna get you
the best lawyer in the country.

14:47.466 --> 14:49.699
Maybe even
that johnnie cochran.

14:49.701 --> 14:51.000
Roberta: Let me talk to him.
Kensi: One second.

14:51.002 --> 14:52.702
Time's up.
Get off the phone.
I just...

14:52.703 --> 14:54.403
I... Just give me two seconds,
all right? Just two seconds.

14:54.405 --> 14:55.871
Also, I need you to check out

14:55.873 --> 14:57.873
Boyle's old partner,
bruce steadman.

14:57.875 --> 14:59.808
Rumor was these guys were
stealing guns, drugs and money

14:59.810 --> 15:01.776
From busts and they were never
caught for it. And also,

15:01.778 --> 15:03.277
Please tell my mom that
johnnie cochran's been dead for,

15:03.279 --> 15:06.046
Like, ten years.
Hello?

15:06.048 --> 15:09.049
Wait, martin?
Martin, honey, are you okay?

15:09.051 --> 15:10.717
Son of a...

15:10.719 --> 15:13.219
So no rollover
minutes, then?

15:15.790 --> 15:17.856
He's gone.

15:32.505 --> 15:34.738
Thank you for meeting
us, lieutenant.

15:34.740 --> 15:37.373
Looks like our boy's
gotten in trouble yet again.

15:37.375 --> 15:39.341
Deeks has a knack
for that.

15:39.343 --> 15:41.209
What can you tell us
about francis boyle?

15:41.211 --> 15:43.844
Well... He was a jackass,
through and through.

15:43.846 --> 15:46.313
Been on the force forever.

15:46.315 --> 15:48.982
He was the kind of cop
you found a way to work with

15:48.984 --> 15:51.351
Even if you hated him, because
he wasn't going anywhere.

15:51.353 --> 15:52.936
Until he got himself shot.

15:52.937 --> 15:54.520
Well, it couldn't have happened
to a nicer guy.

15:54.522 --> 15:56.388
You buy this whole
hooker theory?

15:56.390 --> 15:58.356
I've been a cop a long time;
it's hard to prove guilt

15:58.358 --> 16:01.192
On a hunch.
What about his
partner, steadman?

16:01.194 --> 16:03.394
He's got the gambling bug.
Heads out for hollywood park

16:03.396 --> 16:06.330
The second his shift's over,
stays until the next one begins.

16:06.332 --> 16:09.433
Look, we knew these guys
were a toxic team.

16:09.435 --> 16:11.334
That's why we split 'em up.

16:11.336 --> 16:13.269
But that was like
kicking the hornet's nest.

16:13.271 --> 16:14.970
This is when deeks
partnered up with boyle.

16:14.972 --> 16:16.504
And the winner
of a brand-new steadman?

16:16.506 --> 16:17.505
(chuckling):
Yeah.

16:17.507 --> 16:18.939
Now, christine riley,

16:18.941 --> 16:20.407
That was a tough little chick.

16:20.409 --> 16:22.175
She lasted
six months.

16:22.177 --> 16:23.809
Six months is long
enough to figure out

16:23.811 --> 16:25.377
Steadman's little
side business.

16:25.379 --> 16:27.946
All right, we'll talk to her,
see what she knows.

16:27.948 --> 16:30.882
Well, not so easy.
She only lasted six months

16:30.884 --> 16:32.383
Because she got killed
in a drug bust.

16:32.385 --> 16:35.285
Same kind she'd been
through 20 times before.

16:37.555 --> 16:39.821
That's convenient for steadman.

16:39.823 --> 16:41.389
Figures out she's onto him
and has her killed

16:41.391 --> 16:43.124
Before she can report it.

16:43.126 --> 16:44.992
Thank you, lieutenant.

16:44.994 --> 16:47.093
Thanks, lieutenant.
Good luck, fellas.

16:50.298 --> 16:53.899
Get this-- callen and sam
talked to lieutenant bates.

16:53.901 --> 16:56.401
Steadman had a former partner,
christine riley.

16:56.403 --> 16:58.903
Killed in the line of duty.

16:58.905 --> 17:00.137
What's up, beale?

17:00.139 --> 17:02.472
Why do I feel like
you've been caught

17:02.474 --> 17:03.906
Cheating at minecraft?

17:03.908 --> 17:05.407
I've been looking
through deeks' covers

17:05.409 --> 17:07.375
To see if we missed anything.
Every month

17:07.377 --> 17:10.344
One of his aliases,
monte richards,

17:10.346 --> 17:14.314
Wires $400 to a woman
named julie sanders.

17:14.316 --> 17:18.217
Huh. Maybe his alias rents
a room from her or something.

17:18.219 --> 17:20.886
Julie sanders is actually

17:20.888 --> 17:23.088
Tiffany williams.

17:23.090 --> 17:25.223
Aha.
Multiple arrests
for prostitution.

17:25.225 --> 17:27.225
And seven years ago

17:27.227 --> 17:29.827
She was deeks' lapd informant.

17:29.829 --> 17:31.128
Ruh-roh.

17:31.130 --> 17:32.829
I'll call callen and sam.

17:32.831 --> 17:34.897
Deeks:
¶ I got my ¶

17:34.899 --> 17:37.199
¶ jailhouse blues ¶

17:37.201 --> 17:39.301
¶ they even took the laces
from my shoes ¶

17:39.303 --> 17:40.835
(buzzing, door unlocks)

17:40.837 --> 17:44.438
¶ I got
my jailhouse blues. ¶

17:44.440 --> 17:46.406
Does anybody in here
have a harmonica?

17:46.408 --> 17:47.974
Deeks.
Oh, hey.

17:47.975 --> 17:49.541
You got company.
Oh, fantastic,
my first

17:49.544 --> 17:51.143
Conjugal visit,
that's good news.

17:51.145 --> 17:53.078
(grunts)

17:55.382 --> 17:57.382
They've caged you
like an animal.

17:57.384 --> 18:00.118
Oh, mom, you got to be kidding
me. What are you doing?

18:00.120 --> 18:01.586
Well, I made you
a care package,

18:01.588 --> 18:03.454
But they made me
leave it out front.

18:03.456 --> 18:05.522
O... Okay, listen,
you need to go.

18:05.524 --> 18:07.991
No. Kensi told
me everything.

18:07.993 --> 18:09.392
That woman respects your mother.

18:09.394 --> 18:12.461
This is all just a big mix-up,
it's not a big deal.

18:12.463 --> 18:16.264
Getting somebody else's coffee
at starbucks is a mix-up.

18:16.266 --> 18:18.499
They're accusing you of murder.

18:22.438 --> 18:24.421
I let you down, marty.

18:24.422 --> 18:26.405
Are you talking about the time
you got me stones tickets

18:26.408 --> 18:28.474
And it turned out
to be a cover band

18:28.476 --> 18:30.175
Of a bunch of urologists
from encino?

18:30.177 --> 18:32.410
'cause I wasn't mad,
I was just kind of disappointed.

18:32.412 --> 18:35.146
Don't get smart.

18:35.148 --> 18:39.149
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

18:40.485 --> 18:42.551
You want to have
this conversation?

18:47.391 --> 18:51.092
The only person to blame
for what happened to dad...

18:51.094 --> 18:53.494
Is dad.

18:53.496 --> 18:56.497
And I can't tell you how long
it took me to realize that.

18:56.499 --> 18:58.565
I should have protected you.

18:58.567 --> 19:00.266
You did.

19:00.268 --> 19:03.969
No son should ever be forced
to shoot his own father.

19:04.604 --> 19:06.470
You shot your father?

19:06.472 --> 19:07.504
Wow.

19:07.506 --> 19:10.406
He was trying
to protect me.

19:10.408 --> 19:13.308
That is, um,
privileged information,

19:13.310 --> 19:14.409
It's sealed in
a juvie court,

19:14.411 --> 19:16.511
Totally and
completely irrelevant

19:16.513 --> 19:18.412
And inadmissible in court,
so have fun with that.

19:18.414 --> 19:21.415
Relax, deeks.
I'm here to make you a deal.

19:21.417 --> 19:24.184
Confess to boyle's murder
and I guarantee

19:24.186 --> 19:26.586
You won't go into
general population.

19:26.588 --> 19:29.188
Wow, that is a good deal.

19:29.190 --> 19:30.589
I got a better plan.

19:30.591 --> 19:33.525
Why don't you,
uh, let me go free

19:33.527 --> 19:35.426
And then I can
go find the killer,

19:35.428 --> 19:37.995
'cause you obviously can't.

19:37.996 --> 19:40.563
You are aware that this is
a temporary holding facility.

19:40.566 --> 19:44.234
We're gonna have to move you
to county.

19:44.236 --> 19:47.202
At least you'll probably know
a couple people there.

19:49.472 --> 19:53.240
I messed up again,
didn't I?

19:53.242 --> 19:54.674
Oh, man.

19:54.676 --> 19:56.642
I am so sorry.

19:56.644 --> 19:58.443
I'll go talk to her, honey.

19:58.445 --> 20:00.411
Okay?
Don't go talk to her, you're not
gonna talk to her.

20:00.413 --> 20:02.747
Just stop for two seconds.
We need to finish

20:02.748 --> 20:05.082
This conversation,
because what happened to me--

20:05.084 --> 20:07.084
That is what drives me.

20:07.086 --> 20:08.985
That's what makes me
get up every single day

20:08.987 --> 20:11.387
And do what I do and make sure
the bad guys don't win.

20:11.389 --> 20:14.990
And if I have one regret,
it's that I didn't do it sooner.

20:16.426 --> 20:19.626
Because after he was gone,
this-- you and me--

20:21.329 --> 20:24.463
That's what makes me who I am.

20:26.099 --> 20:28.299
I don't know how,

20:28.301 --> 20:31.101
But, man, I raised a good one.

20:31.103 --> 20:32.702
You did good.

20:32.704 --> 20:35.304
Mm.

20:35.306 --> 20:37.172
Oh, that's dry. You
need some moisturizer.

20:37.174 --> 20:38.473
All right, mom.
All right, I love you.

20:38.475 --> 20:42.143
You got to go.
You got to go. Guard.

20:43.479 --> 20:46.679
Woman (over p.A.):
Enrique, I need help
loading on 5, please.

20:48.182 --> 20:50.182
Julie sanders?

20:50.184 --> 20:52.150
Federal agent
sam hanna.

20:52.152 --> 20:54.519
How can I help you?

20:54.521 --> 20:57.355
You can't help me.
Tiffany can.

20:57.357 --> 21:00.358
There's nobody named tiffany
working here.

21:00.360 --> 21:03.060
Look, we can do this
a couple of ways.

21:03.062 --> 21:06.729
I arrest you on a murder
warrant-- that's the hard one.

21:09.600 --> 21:12.467
Let me ask my boss
if I can take my break.

21:12.469 --> 21:14.569
Appreciate it.

21:20.376 --> 21:22.642
(panting)

21:27.715 --> 21:30.515
Told you she was a runner.
You owe me, by the way.

21:30.517 --> 21:33.584
How about I get you a
ficus, and we call it even?

21:33.586 --> 21:37.054
What is this about?
The murder of lapd
detective francis boyle.

21:37.056 --> 21:39.423
I have no idea who that is.

21:39.425 --> 21:41.025
Oh, that's funny,
because your prints

21:41.026 --> 21:42.626
And your blood were all
over the murder scene.

21:42.628 --> 21:45.195
I didn't kill him.

21:46.231 --> 21:48.497
But I know who did.

22:02.579 --> 22:04.745
Boyle liked to get rough.

22:04.747 --> 22:07.414
Only the desperate girls
went there.

22:07.416 --> 22:09.416
So, you were desperate?

22:09.418 --> 22:11.418
No.

22:11.420 --> 22:13.386
I stayed away from that

22:13.388 --> 22:15.554
Until quinn asked me
to help set him up.

22:15.556 --> 22:17.255
Detective john quinn?

22:17.257 --> 22:19.724
Yeah. He told me internal
affairs was setting up a sting,

22:19.726 --> 22:22.560
And all I had to do was
let boyle pick me up,

22:22.562 --> 22:24.428
And they were going
to arrest him.

22:24.430 --> 22:26.396
So what happened?
Nothing.

22:26.398 --> 22:29.365
Boyle picked me up,
took me to a motel.

22:29.367 --> 22:31.633
I kept waiting
for quinn and the cops

22:31.635 --> 22:34.435
To come bursting through
the door, but they never did.

22:34.437 --> 22:36.103
Boyle left
after we had sex.

22:36.105 --> 22:37.604
I called quinn,
and he never answered.

22:37.606 --> 22:38.838
So, boyle left
the motel?

22:38.840 --> 22:40.806
Yeah.

22:40.808 --> 22:42.574
But he came back.

22:42.576 --> 22:44.842
I waited for quinn
and kept calling

22:44.844 --> 22:47.778
For at least a couple hours,
and that is when boyle returned.

22:47.780 --> 22:50.680
He was out of his mind, and
he accused me of setting him up.

22:50.682 --> 22:52.181
Which you did.

22:52.183 --> 22:54.650
To be arrested, not ripped off.

22:54.652 --> 22:56.551
He beat the hell out of me.

22:56.553 --> 22:58.203
He asked me
where his stuff was.

22:58.204 --> 22:59.854
I had no idea what he was
talking about, and he threatened

22:59.856 --> 23:01.822
To kill me if I didn't tell him
who I was working with.

23:01.824 --> 23:03.456
Did you give him
john quinn's name?

23:03.458 --> 23:05.458
Yeah.

23:05.460 --> 23:08.360
That really set him off.

23:08.362 --> 23:11.262
He called his partner, and
that's when I made a run for it.

23:11.264 --> 23:13.464
You're saying
you didn't kill boyle?

23:13.466 --> 23:15.165
Seriously?

23:15.167 --> 23:16.599
I weigh a hundred pounds
soaking wet.

23:16.601 --> 23:19.301
The guy was an easy 250
with a couple of guns.

23:19.303 --> 23:21.369
I got out of there
the first chance I had.

23:21.371 --> 23:23.404
You didn't report any of this
to the police?

23:23.406 --> 23:24.571
He<i> was</i> the police.

23:24.573 --> 23:26.389
So was quinn.

23:26.390 --> 23:28.206
I was a 17-year-old hooker
with a criminal record.

23:28.209 --> 23:29.508
So where does deeks come in?

23:29.510 --> 23:30.876
You tell me.

23:30.878 --> 23:34.512
He was always...
Good to me and the other girls.

23:35.515 --> 23:37.381
Not in that way.

23:37.383 --> 23:38.715
He was very kind.

23:38.717 --> 23:40.483
And you were his informant?

23:40.485 --> 23:44.219
He was the one guy
and the only cop I could trust.

23:45.488 --> 23:47.387
He helped me get back
on my feet.

23:47.389 --> 23:49.389
Still does.

23:49.391 --> 23:51.624
Yeah.

23:55.496 --> 23:57.729
So if you didn't kill boyle,

23:57.731 --> 23:59.797
Who did?

24:00.766 --> 24:02.899
Had to have been quinn.

24:07.305 --> 24:09.138
Do you trust her?

24:09.140 --> 24:11.640
I don't trust anybody.

24:11.642 --> 24:13.508
Do you think
she's telling the truth?

24:13.510 --> 24:16.711
As an ia investigator,
quinn knew boyle was dirty,

24:16.713 --> 24:19.346
And had an ongoing
investigation against him.

24:19.348 --> 24:21.881
He must have figured out
where they kept the money,

24:21.883 --> 24:24.617
Drugs, guns and everything else
they'd stolen.

24:24.619 --> 24:26.585
And since quinn was ia,
he could kill boyle himself

24:26.587 --> 24:27.886
Without the fear
of being found out.

24:27.888 --> 24:30.288
Well, it's pretty easy
to cover up a murder

24:30.290 --> 24:32.323
You committed when
you're the primary investigator.

24:32.325 --> 24:34.558
We find quinn's stash,
we find quinn.

24:34.560 --> 24:37.661
If he hasn't beaten us to it.

24:37.663 --> 24:39.429
(buzzer sounds)

24:39.431 --> 24:41.464
Man:
Deeks, you've
got company.

24:41.466 --> 24:42.798
Not again.

24:42.800 --> 24:45.233
Am I disturbing you?

24:46.202 --> 24:48.502
It took you long enough.

24:48.504 --> 24:50.737
You have any idea
what being in the clink

24:50.739 --> 24:52.505
Does to a man, huh?

24:52.506 --> 24:54.272
Alone and desperate,
with nothing to hold onto

24:54.275 --> 24:56.441
But the cold steel
of the prison bars?

24:56.443 --> 24:58.476
Hmm. It's been two days.

24:58.478 --> 25:00.711
Yeah, but time stops
in the slammer, kens.

25:00.713 --> 25:02.646
I'm very sorry. My partner
was arrested for murder,

25:02.648 --> 25:05.615
And I have been spending all my
time trying to clear his name.

25:05.617 --> 25:07.316
Oh, wow. Touché. Well done.

25:07.318 --> 25:08.950
My partner has also
been sending money

25:08.952 --> 25:10.751
To a prostitute every month.

25:10.753 --> 25:13.487
You found tiffany?

25:13.489 --> 25:15.489
Yeah.
That's not good.

25:15.491 --> 25:17.557
No, it's not
good at all.

25:17.559 --> 25:18.958
I'm not talking about me.
I'm talking about her.

25:18.960 --> 25:20.426
She was a good person
who got stuck

25:20.428 --> 25:21.627
In a bad spot,
and I helped her out.

25:21.629 --> 25:22.894
By hiding a fugitive?

25:22.896 --> 25:25.229
Kensi, trust me,
she didn't kill anybody.

25:27.533 --> 25:29.599
Listen, you need to understand,
this may not be going away.

25:29.601 --> 25:31.834
Don't be a drama
queen right now.

25:31.836 --> 25:34.303
If I don't confess,
I'm going to county.
You're not going to county,

25:34.305 --> 25:36.605
Deeks, and this
is gonna be fine.
Okay, but that's what I'm say...

25:36.607 --> 25:37.906
Just hold on a second.
Baby, hold on a second, just...

25:37.908 --> 25:38.907
We're gonna figure it out, okay?

25:38.909 --> 25:40.475
I got to get back.
Can you...?

25:40.477 --> 25:42.477
Guard?

25:42.479 --> 25:45.379
(door buzzes)

25:45.381 --> 25:47.614
Boyle and steadman skim
hot weapons and drugs,

25:47.616 --> 25:49.616
And resell 'em for a profit.

25:49.618 --> 25:51.484
Internal affairs
detective quinn

25:51.486 --> 25:52.785
Sees an opportunity

25:52.787 --> 25:54.920
To rip off the dirty cops
he's been investigating.

25:54.922 --> 25:57.589
Boyle finds out,
and it's sayonara, boyle.

25:57.591 --> 25:58.890
Before quinn
can make a getaway,

25:58.892 --> 26:00.825
We bust him for working
with the arms dealer.

26:00.827 --> 26:03.594
Kensi:
This isn't working, hetty.

26:03.596 --> 26:05.045
This is not working.

26:05.046 --> 26:06.495
You have us chasing hunches
and dead ends

26:06.498 --> 26:08.564
While deeks is in a jail,
and ia pins a murder on him.

26:08.566 --> 26:10.866
Everything we're doing
has purpose.

26:10.868 --> 26:13.435
But it's not working, hetty.
It is not enough.

26:13.437 --> 26:15.403
We know deeks isn't guilty.

26:15.405 --> 26:17.538
What is this machiavellian plan
you're working on?

26:17.540 --> 26:20.674
I understand your frustration,
agent blye.

26:20.676 --> 26:22.475
I am not frustrated, hetty.
I am pissed!

26:22.477 --> 26:25.511
They're sending deeks
to county jail

26:25.513 --> 26:26.678
If he doesn't confess.

26:26.680 --> 26:28.246
Do you have any idea
what'll happen

26:28.248 --> 26:29.547
To deeks in county jail
with gang members

26:29.549 --> 26:31.849
And criminals that he helped
put away as a cop?

26:31.851 --> 26:34.384
Or is this just part
of your master plan maybe?

26:34.386 --> 26:35.551
Kensi...
You... You owe me, hetty.

26:35.553 --> 26:37.619
You said
you were in my debt once.

26:37.621 --> 26:39.020
I'm calling in
that marker now.

26:39.022 --> 26:40.554
Get deeks out.

26:40.556 --> 26:42.322
I don't care how you do it.

26:42.324 --> 26:46.392
Go home and take a shower,

26:46.394 --> 26:48.594
Try and eat something,

26:48.596 --> 26:51.830
And try and get
some sleep.

27:03.410 --> 27:05.476
(typing)

27:08.747 --> 27:10.813
(sighs)

27:16.987 --> 27:19.354
(knocking)

27:24.026 --> 27:26.026
Mrs. Deeks.

27:26.028 --> 27:28.628
I was in the neighborhood.

27:29.597 --> 27:31.730
With a casserole?

27:31.732 --> 27:33.765
Boy. (laughs)

27:33.767 --> 27:36.801
Two parents
in the same line of work.

27:36.803 --> 27:39.003
Boy, that's gonna be tough.

27:39.005 --> 27:41.338
No. Yes. Yeah,
we're not really, um...

27:41.340 --> 27:42.839
I mean, we are,
but just not for the...

27:42.841 --> 27:44.907
Ever think about bringing the
trash can closer to this room?

27:44.909 --> 27:46.375
Okay, mrs. Deeks, please.

27:46.377 --> 27:49.044
Why don't you just tell me
why you're here?

27:54.651 --> 27:58.019
I let a terrible thing happen
to him once.

27:58.021 --> 28:00.654
I've seen the way
he looks at you, kensi.

28:00.656 --> 28:02.656
He trusts you.

28:02.658 --> 28:04.591
Don't let him down like I did.

28:04.593 --> 28:06.593
(sighs)

28:06.595 --> 28:09.795
I'm trying as hard
as hell not to.

28:11.665 --> 28:13.665
You promise me

28:13.667 --> 28:16.534
You'll do everything you can
to get him out of there.

28:16.536 --> 28:18.502
I promise.

28:18.504 --> 28:20.704
Cross your heart
and hope to blye?

28:21.673 --> 28:24.407
(laughs)

28:24.409 --> 28:27.576
Apple doesn't fall far
from the tree, does it?

28:31.114 --> 28:34.482
I've been sitting
on that one for weeks.

28:34.484 --> 28:36.550
(laughs)

28:38.120 --> 28:41.454
I can't protect you if you leave
this room without a confession.

28:41.456 --> 28:43.856
You really don't care
who killed boyle, do you?

28:43.858 --> 28:47.125
We both know
you killed boyle.

28:47.127 --> 28:49.894
I'm just trying to make
the best of a crappy situation.

28:49.896 --> 28:51.962
Hmm.

28:54.766 --> 28:57.633
Okay.

28:57.635 --> 29:00.135
I'll confess to...

29:00.137 --> 29:03.605
Self-defense manslaughter.

29:03.607 --> 29:05.006
He was a police officer.

29:05.008 --> 29:07.641
So am I,
and you can't prove malice.

29:07.643 --> 29:09.042
Detective whiting?

29:09.044 --> 29:10.843
I'm in the middle
of an interrogation.

29:10.845 --> 29:12.945
Sorry. The commissioner's office
is on the phone.

29:12.947 --> 29:14.613
Says it's urgent.

29:16.583 --> 29:18.816
We are so far
from being done here.

29:21.520 --> 29:23.852
Let me know if you find
that french press.

29:26.590 --> 29:29.424
(sighs)

29:31.961 --> 29:33.961
You're a son of a bitch.

29:33.963 --> 29:36.029
But boyle was a bigger one,

29:36.031 --> 29:38.765
So you need to get out
of here and prove it.

29:38.767 --> 29:40.800
Lapd doesn't like a scandal.

29:40.802 --> 29:42.768
Uh, you're helping
a detective

29:42.770 --> 29:44.770
Accused of murder
escape custody.

29:44.772 --> 29:46.872
You do understand the
definition of a scandal, right?

29:46.874 --> 29:48.406
Shut up, deeks.

29:48.408 --> 29:49.673
You got three minutes

29:49.675 --> 29:51.875
Before whiting gets sick
of being on hold.

29:51.877 --> 29:54.410
You go out this door,
down the stairs,

29:54.412 --> 29:56.011
You head for the east exit.

29:56.013 --> 29:58.046
And then you run like hell.

29:58.048 --> 30:00.715
I wish I could
quit you.

30:00.717 --> 30:02.783
I love that mustache.

30:02.785 --> 30:04.851
Piece of work.

30:07.689 --> 30:09.755
(indistinct crowd chatter)

30:24.938 --> 30:28.172
Lock down the exits.

30:28.174 --> 30:30.507
No one in or out
until we get deeks.

30:34.812 --> 30:36.878
(siren chirps)

30:38.815 --> 30:40.181
Steadman:
Hey!

30:40.183 --> 30:41.715
Deeks!

30:49.190 --> 30:51.790
(horn honking, tires squealing)

30:51.792 --> 30:53.458
(horn honking)

30:58.765 --> 31:00.598
(tires squealing)

31:01.734 --> 31:03.834
What the hell?!

31:03.836 --> 31:05.835
Stay in the car!

31:08.239 --> 31:11.506
¶ ¶

31:44.507 --> 31:46.139
Hey, guys, deeks is out.

31:46.141 --> 31:47.874
Good.
Actually,
he escaped

31:47.876 --> 31:49.675
A few
hours ago.
What?!

31:49.677 --> 31:52.577
If deeks is a fugitive, it's
just gonna make him look guilty.

31:52.579 --> 31:54.211
He should have stayed
in police custody.

31:54.213 --> 31:55.745
I would have done
the same thing.

31:55.747 --> 31:57.012
You<i> have</i> done the same thing.

31:57.014 --> 31:58.213
We have any way
to find him?

31:58.215 --> 32:00.148
He left all
of his personal belongings,

32:00.150 --> 32:02.517
Meaning no phone,
no money, nothing.

32:02.519 --> 32:03.985
And every cop in l.A. Looking
for him,

32:03.987 --> 32:06.787
Thinking he's a cop killer.

32:06.789 --> 32:09.222
Have kensi meet us downtown.
Yeah.

32:09.224 --> 32:12.225
Monica.

32:12.227 --> 32:14.160
Monica!

32:14.162 --> 32:16.795
Hey, you okay?

32:16.797 --> 32:18.596
Where's quinn?

32:18.598 --> 32:20.064
Quinn!

32:20.066 --> 32:22.800
(groans)

32:23.235 --> 32:25.235
Anything?

32:25.237 --> 32:28.037
No. Eric, you sure this is
the last place you saw him?

32:28.039 --> 32:29.271
Yeah. He was moving fast.

32:29.273 --> 32:30.939
I haven't seen him
since he crossed flower.

32:30.941 --> 32:32.273
Maybe they
caught him.
Nell: We're monitoring

32:32.275 --> 32:35.142
Lapd transmission.
Nothing has shown up yet.

32:35.144 --> 32:36.977
Why hasn't he contacted us?
He doesn't have a phone.

32:36.979 --> 32:38.311
Okay, so he lifts one
or he goes to the library

32:38.313 --> 32:39.312
And sends an e-mail.

32:39.314 --> 32:40.680
There.

32:40.682 --> 32:42.148
We got him.

32:42.150 --> 32:44.650
He got on a bus at 6:15
this morning, corner

32:44.652 --> 32:46.551
Of 5th and hill street.

32:46.553 --> 32:49.320
Bus number 12-3-09.
Its first run of the day.

32:49.322 --> 32:50.788
Callen:
Send us its route.

32:50.790 --> 32:51.555
See if you spot him getting off.

32:51.557 --> 32:52.889
Where is
that bus now

32:52.891 --> 32:54.857
And what's the quickest
path to intercept it?

32:54.859 --> 32:56.692
Where's quinn?
I don't know, man.

32:56.694 --> 32:59.561
I-I didn't even know
that he was out of jail

32:59.563 --> 33:01.329
Until they came here
yesterday and told...
(grunts)

33:01.331 --> 33:02.563
Stop!

33:02.565 --> 33:03.630
(coughs)
where's quinn?

33:03.632 --> 33:05.198
I told you, man. I don't know.

33:05.200 --> 33:06.632
(grunts)
(shouts)

33:06.634 --> 33:09.635
Listen, man. I don't know...
Hold on a second!

33:09.637 --> 33:11.303
I don't know where quinn is,
but I know where your stash is.

33:11.305 --> 33:12.570
But you got
to let her go.

33:12.572 --> 33:13.938
She had nothing to do with this.

33:13.940 --> 33:15.339
I will.

33:15.341 --> 33:17.674
If you take me to our stuff.

33:17.676 --> 33:19.676
But if you're lying to me,

33:19.678 --> 33:22.845
I'll kill her, and you'll be
begging me to kill you, too,

33:22.847 --> 33:24.246
Before we're done.

33:26.116 --> 33:28.783
Thank you. Driver didn't see
deeks get on or off the bus.

33:28.785 --> 33:31.786
It's a busy route.
Security footage.
I'm sending it to ops.

33:31.788 --> 33:34.922
Okay, so what's between here
and downtown?

33:34.924 --> 33:36.223
Monica lee.

33:36.225 --> 33:37.624
Yeah.

33:37.626 --> 33:39.025
Eric, we need eyes
on monica lee's house.

33:39.027 --> 33:40.626
I think
that's where he's headed.

33:40.628 --> 33:42.227
The closest we have is
a traffic cam on wilshire

33:42.229 --> 33:45.296
And an atm on the corner
of olympic, wh...
(beeping)

33:45.298 --> 33:48.932
We found him.

33:48.934 --> 33:50.366
Deeks is in the boatshed
with monica lee

33:50.368 --> 33:51.367
And detective steadman,

33:51.369 --> 33:53.802
Who has them both in handcuffs.

33:53.804 --> 33:55.203
Smart boy.

33:55.205 --> 33:58.072
Okay. Get lapd to send
a tactical team to the boatshed.

33:58.074 --> 34:00.074
Absolutely not.

34:00.076 --> 34:02.643
The cops will listen to steadman
before they listen to us.

34:02.645 --> 34:04.244
Have our people secure
a silent perimeter

34:04.246 --> 34:05.678
Until we're on the scene.

34:05.680 --> 34:07.680
(tires screech)

34:07.682 --> 34:09.047
(engine revving)

34:12.185 --> 34:13.384
(grunts)

34:13.386 --> 34:15.386
(grunts)
where is it?

34:15.388 --> 34:18.288
First, you got to let her go.

34:19.357 --> 34:21.623
(grunts)

34:23.026 --> 34:25.493
(gasps)

34:25.494 --> 34:27.961
I'm going to break a finger
for every second that goes by

34:27.964 --> 34:29.997
That I don't see my stuff.

34:29.999 --> 34:32.099
You are just as sick as boyle.

34:32.101 --> 34:35.335
Actually, he was the nice one.

34:35.337 --> 34:36.936
(grunts)
(shouting)

34:40.708 --> 34:42.708
It's in here.

34:42.710 --> 34:44.742
It's in here! Come on!

34:48.080 --> 34:49.245
There's a trap door

34:49.247 --> 34:51.312
Under this table.

34:53.916 --> 34:55.348
Open it.

34:55.350 --> 34:57.883
I'd love to, but my keys
are back at the station.

34:57.885 --> 34:59.351
There's an ax out there.
You can grab it.

34:59.353 --> 35:00.785
No one's gonna hear you.

35:02.388 --> 35:03.920
Wow.

35:03.922 --> 35:05.254
You grabbed my keys.

35:05.256 --> 35:06.922
That's incredibly thoughtful
of you.

35:06.924 --> 35:08.924
Listen, perchance, you didn't
grab my wallet, did you?

35:08.926 --> 35:11.026
'cause I had, like,
600 bucks in there.

35:11.028 --> 35:13.328
Fat chance. Open it.

35:13.330 --> 35:16.431
How? My hands are cuffed
behind my back.

35:16.433 --> 35:18.166
Figure it out.

35:18.168 --> 35:20.134
Guys, they're
in the interrogation room.

35:20.136 --> 35:22.035
Steadman has deeks
on his knees with a gun

35:22.037 --> 35:23.302
To his head.

35:23.304 --> 35:24.970
Oh, my god,
he's gonna execute him.

35:24.972 --> 35:26.304
(grunts)

35:26.306 --> 35:28.172
(keys jangle)

35:28.174 --> 35:29.706
(grunts)

35:29.708 --> 35:32.842
There you go, tough
guy. Unlocked.

35:32.844 --> 35:34.810
Well, open it.

35:34.812 --> 35:36.678
It weighs 80 pounds.

35:36.680 --> 35:38.279
I had to pull a houdini
just to unlock it.

35:38.281 --> 35:40.381
Listen, you take off my cuffs,
then I'll lift it.

35:40.383 --> 35:42.750
You open it, honey.

35:42.752 --> 35:45.352
I'm telling you, man. It's
too heavy. She can't lift it.

35:45.354 --> 35:47.354
There's no way
she's gonna be able to...

35:47.356 --> 35:49.756
You know what, fine,
I don't care. Give it a shot.

35:49.758 --> 35:51.057
Guys, they're trying
to open

35:51.059 --> 35:52.024
The trap door.

35:53.861 --> 35:55.126
Is that for us or for them?

35:55.128 --> 35:56.293
Hopefully it's for them,

35:56.295 --> 35:57.394
'cause I don't feel
like swimming.

35:57.396 --> 36:00.096
(grunts)
(pants)

36:01.065 --> 36:02.431
Voila.

36:02.433 --> 36:03.932
What is this, a joke?

36:03.934 --> 36:05.567
A joke?

36:05.568 --> 36:07.201
No, this is the best
hiding place on the planet.

36:07.203 --> 36:09.369
We sunk it
in waterproof containers.

36:09.371 --> 36:10.436
You need scuba tanks
to get there.

36:10.438 --> 36:12.371
The bay is so murky,
you can't see it

36:12.373 --> 36:13.722
From three feet away.
And I know what you're thinking.

36:13.723 --> 36:15.072
You're thinking I'm a genius.
And you'd be right.

36:15.075 --> 36:16.808
Because you know
what quinn wanted to do?

36:16.810 --> 36:18.743
He wanted to put it
in a bus locker.

36:18.745 --> 36:21.045
Our stuff wouldn't fit
in a bus locker.

36:21.047 --> 36:22.713
No, I didn't...
I didn't say "bus locker."

36:22.715 --> 36:24.748
I said "bus lockers," plural.

36:24.750 --> 36:26.216
He wanted to put it
all over town.

36:26.218 --> 36:28.885
You don't have it.

36:28.887 --> 36:30.786
You never did.

36:30.788 --> 36:31.386
No!

36:31.388 --> 36:31.953
No!

36:31.955 --> 36:33.187
(grunts)

36:33.956 --> 36:34.754
Jump!

36:46.334 --> 36:48.400
Deeks!

36:49.336 --> 36:51.168
Deeks!

36:53.805 --> 36:55.471
(car doors shut)

36:55.473 --> 36:56.972
Federal agents!
Drop it!

36:56.974 --> 36:59.341
(gunshots)

37:09.051 --> 37:10.784
Just give me a reason.

37:10.786 --> 37:14.053
(chuckles)
you're out of your league,
honey.

37:14.055 --> 37:16.455
Just like your partner was.

37:17.424 --> 37:19.824
It's over, detective.

37:21.994 --> 37:25.462
Or you can try
and make a run for it.

37:25.464 --> 37:28.765
Granger:
Agent blye.

37:28.767 --> 37:30.767
Stand down, kensi.

37:43.414 --> 37:44.379
Move in.

37:46.082 --> 37:48.048
Deeks. Deeks?!

37:52.554 --> 37:55.488
Deeks!

38:03.230 --> 38:04.495
(grunts)

38:04.497 --> 38:06.897
Okay. Okay.

38:13.838 --> 38:17.105
How come you're never
that excited to see me?

38:17.107 --> 38:20.575
I carry my joy inside.

38:20.577 --> 38:22.510
The hell
does that even mean?

38:22.512 --> 38:24.845
It means you won't be
getting a hug anytime soon.

38:24.847 --> 38:26.513
(chuckles)

38:26.515 --> 38:30.016
Nothing? No hug?

38:30.018 --> 38:32.885
(indistinct police transmission)

38:32.887 --> 38:34.820
I don't know
how you do it, deeks.

38:34.822 --> 38:36.888
You always manage to come out
of the manure pile

38:36.890 --> 38:38.055
Smelling like a rose.

38:38.057 --> 38:39.589
Stop. You're making me blush.

38:39.591 --> 38:40.590
So, we good here?

38:40.592 --> 38:43.059
For now.

38:43.061 --> 38:44.560
He's all yours.

38:44.562 --> 38:45.894
Lucky us.

38:46.897 --> 38:48.162
You know what
this seems like?

38:48.164 --> 38:50.130
A good opportunity
for a group hug.

38:50.132 --> 38:52.866
Not even with a gun to my head.
Deeks:
All right.

38:52.868 --> 38:54.567
How about a drink?

38:54.569 --> 38:55.534
I'm in.

38:55.536 --> 38:56.968
Callen, you?

38:56.970 --> 38:58.302
He's in, too.

38:58.304 --> 38:59.469
Apparently
I'm in.

38:59.471 --> 39:01.538
Unless you got
a couch date.

39:01.539 --> 39:03.606
It's a generous offer, but
it's been a rough couple days.

39:03.608 --> 39:05.074
I think I'm
gonna head home.

39:05.076 --> 39:06.909
I think your mom
would like to see you.

39:06.911 --> 39:09.044
Oh. On second thought, I'm in.

39:09.046 --> 39:10.311
Deeks.
What?

39:10.313 --> 39:11.312
I can just send her a text,
right?

39:11.314 --> 39:12.313
With, like, a happy face

39:12.315 --> 39:13.580
And some
emoji hearts?

39:13.582 --> 39:15.315
No.
I'll call her.

39:15.317 --> 39:16.849
Come on. First round's on me.

39:18.485 --> 39:19.984
Thanks, brother.

39:20.953 --> 39:22.619
You coming?

39:22.621 --> 39:25.555
Yeah. Just got to make a stop
on the way. I'll meet you there.

39:25.557 --> 39:27.557
Bye.

39:27.559 --> 39:29.625
You're cute.

39:36.566 --> 39:39.633
You could have lost all this.

39:40.569 --> 39:43.636
Hetty:
You or me?

39:46.007 --> 39:47.639
(chuckles softly)

39:47.641 --> 39:49.907
Both of us.

39:51.644 --> 39:54.945
You know where quinn is?

39:55.881 --> 39:57.947
Yes.

40:01.886 --> 40:03.619
He never escaped, did he?

40:03.621 --> 40:07.656
No, but it was made
to look that way.

40:07.658 --> 40:11.660
So you faked quinn's escape
to draw out steadman?

40:11.662 --> 40:15.463
It was all I could think of
to make this mess go away

40:15.465 --> 40:17.264
Once and for all.

40:17.266 --> 40:19.499
I had him

40:19.501 --> 40:23.069
Transferred
to a medium-security facility

40:23.071 --> 40:25.004
In pennsylvania

40:25.006 --> 40:27.139
Under a new name.

40:27.141 --> 40:29.407
In exchange for what?

40:29.409 --> 40:31.442
His cooperation

40:31.444 --> 40:33.977
And the whereabouts
of detective boyle

40:33.979 --> 40:37.180
And steadman's ill-gotten goods.

40:37.182 --> 40:38.447
So you found the stash?

40:38.449 --> 40:40.649
Yes.
As will

40:40.651 --> 40:42.183
Internal affairs.

40:42.185 --> 40:45.052
In steadman's garage.

40:50.359 --> 40:53.426
Why'd you do this?

40:54.462 --> 40:57.229
Why did you kill boyle?

41:09.108 --> 41:13.009
He was gonna kill tiffany.

41:15.947 --> 41:19.014
Why didn't you tell
the others?

41:19.950 --> 41:23.685
It's not my story to tell.

41:23.687 --> 41:28.722
Then again, I'm not sure that
it should be yours either.

41:28.724 --> 41:30.990
Even if it's the truth?

41:33.094 --> 41:35.159
Hmm.

41:38.097 --> 41:40.964
How do I not tell kensi?

41:40.966 --> 41:44.067
I just... I can't keep
this secret from her.

41:45.036 --> 41:48.971
Ultimately,
that's your decision, mr. Deeks.

41:48.973 --> 41:54.008
But I've always
found that secrets

41:54.010 --> 41:56.677
Are much
easier to keep

41:56.679 --> 41:59.212
When you have...

41:59.214 --> 42:03.683
No one to share them with.
