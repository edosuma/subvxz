02:09.363 --> 02:10.431
Good morning.

02:25.733 --> 02:28.277
Good morning, Mr. Garms.

02:29.278 --> 02:30.655
After you.

02:33.992 --> 02:35.576
Garms!

02:38.162 --> 02:41.833
The name is Nesbitt.
You must have the wrong fellow.

02:44.168 --> 02:45.920
Oh yeah?

03:04.355 --> 03:07.984
We don't care for bounty hunters, Mr.

03:08.109 --> 03:11.195
So why don't you just get on your
horse and ride on out?

03:11.320 --> 03:15.658
I don't care what name you call him. Harry
Nesbitt is a good friend of mine.

03:15.783 --> 03:19.253
Look, it was along time ago.
I was just a kid.

03:19.453 --> 03:20.955
Them days are behind me.

03:21.706 --> 03:25.168
I got a whole new life here.
A damn good life.

03:25.293 --> 03:27.962
That's just about finished.

05:41.979 --> 05:45.599
- They move along good, Mr. Morgan.
- Keep at them.

06:52.416 --> 06:54.919
Hey-up. Hey-up.

07:10.935 --> 07:12.770
Hi Kiefer.

07:20.110 --> 07:23.239
So you found them... after all.

07:23.364 --> 07:26.617
Yeah. No thanks to you.

07:27.701 --> 07:30.204
Sheriff, you knew him?

07:30.913 --> 07:34.583
Lots of people around here
thought he was a good man.

07:34.708 --> 07:38.379
- A wanted man, that's all that matters.
- To you.

07:39.296 --> 07:40.464
To the law.

07:41.799 --> 07:46.429
- The law is my business.
- Yeah. But you didn't do it.

07:46.554 --> 07:48.973
You don't kill a man for 200 dollars.

07:49.214 --> 07:51.684
Every man has his choice...,
..he made his.

07:51.809 --> 07:56.772
One of these days, Kiefer...
...you're gonna go too far.

07:56.897 --> 08:01.485
If I do... it would be for a hell
lot more than this.

08:07.199 --> 08:08.993
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

08:14.039 --> 08:18.002
First time I ever saw you
two move fast.

08:19.420 --> 08:22.923
- What about the bonus?
- You got it.

08:23.048 --> 08:25.509
Even though you didn't earn it.

08:25.634 --> 08:30.931
- Oh Mr. Pike, Will was really sick.
- Yeah, terrible pain right here.

08:31.056 --> 08:32.796
Wouldn't wish it on a rat.

08:41.734 --> 08:45.195
Figure .. we deserve a drink too.

08:45.988 --> 08:47.698
Well, Pike...

08:48.449 --> 08:50.117
Here's to us!

08:51.118 --> 08:54.204
My God.. here's to us.

08:58.625 --> 09:01.754
You always knew that we were gonna make it,
Mr. Morgan?

09:01.879 --> 09:04.256
There were times when I wondered.

09:04.381 --> 09:09.136
Wondered plenty. Maybe I was
biting off more than I could chew.

09:09.887 --> 09:13.724
- How does it feel to be rich?
- Damned good.

09:14.266 --> 09:18.729
But Hell, Pike, this money
is for all of us down in Sonora.

09:18.854 --> 09:20.898
We're gonna do things down there.

09:21.023 --> 09:24.360
All those things we have been
talking about all those years.

09:24.485 --> 09:28.572
That sounds mighty good to me.

09:29.907 --> 09:34.286
We're gonna make us a place where everybody
can live...

09:34.411 --> 09:39.833
...without anybody to tell us
what to think, what to do.

09:41.001 --> 09:44.922
A place where a man can be what he is.

09:46.799 --> 09:49.899
Some good folks down in
Sonora, Mr. Morgan.

09:50.523 --> 09:55.933
- Best I've ever met.
- Well, Pike, that is your home now.

09:56.330 --> 09:59.770
You're as much a part of the
Morgan ranch as I am.

10:02.731 --> 10:07.861
Mrs Linda Morgan, ranch
Dos Rios, Sonora, Mexico.

10:08.904 --> 10:13.033
Everything is fine here. Stop.
Coming home with Pike. Stop.

10:13.158 --> 10:15.828
Your loving husband, Bob Morgan.

10:15.953 --> 10:18.247
- How long is that going to take?
- Not long at all.

10:18.372 --> 10:21.792
She ought to have it in a day or so.

10:24.541 --> 10:26.880
Get this out a soon as you can, will you?

10:29.049 --> 10:31.439
- Can we send this right now?
- I will take care of it.

10:31.502 --> 10:36.865
- Well, she knows we're headed home now, sir.
- Yeah. Yeah she ought to.

10:36.963 --> 10:39.201
What is it?

10:39.226 --> 10:42.280
It must be.. I am little tired.

10:42.415 --> 10:46.316
- I'll take you to the hotel.
- No, just give me a minute.

10:49.528 --> 10:53.198
Take it easy, Mr. Morgan.

10:54.083 --> 10:55.909
No time, Pike.

10:56.743 --> 10:58.579
You listen.

10:59.162 --> 11:04.293
No one but you.. you are gonna
get that money back to the ranch.

11:04.418 --> 11:07.421
All the people are... counting on you.

11:07.546 --> 11:10.173
You are going back, Mr. Morgan.

11:10.924 --> 11:13.468
Give me your word, Pike!

11:14.469 --> 11:16.346
Give me your word.

11:16.471 --> 11:21.727
No matter what happens... you get that
money back down there.

11:21.852 --> 11:24.813
Everything depends on that.

11:24.938 --> 11:26.857
For everybody.

11:27.482 --> 11:30.360
All our plans...

11:30.944 --> 11:33.196
You got my words.

11:33.739 --> 11:36.867
- Then I...
- Mr. Morgan?

12:30.921 --> 12:32.506
Card?

12:46.353 --> 12:48.605
Well, Mister dealer,

12:49.439 --> 12:52.859
I certainly would call this a fine hand.

12:52.984 --> 12:57.531
Lacking only one thing which, I
trust, you will now deliver unto me.

12:57.967 --> 13:00.617
What the Hell are you talking about?

13:01.118 --> 13:03.286
One card, sir.

13:06.405 --> 13:07.457
Three.

13:09.126 --> 13:10.961
And one for the dealer.

13:14.360 --> 13:15.382
Ah.. one.

13:16.216 --> 13:19.052
I believe one of you gentlemen
have the bet.

13:19.177 --> 13:22.806
Here's your two. I'll
push you for two more.

13:23.223 --> 13:26.092
Your name wouldn't happen to be Pike?

13:28.019 --> 13:32.816
I've been called a lot of things, sir
But that ain't one of them.

13:33.650 --> 13:36.319
Thought it might be my lucky day.

13:39.489 --> 13:42.033
Do you know that buck that's
driving to Sonora?

13:42.158 --> 13:45.745
The one with 86,000 dollars.

13:46.927 --> 13:50.709
You tryin' to tell me that story
about the Morgan payroll is true?

13:50.834 --> 13:53.628
I swear, Mr.
My cousin Billy's seen it.

13:53.753 --> 13:56.756
Play the God damn cards.

13:58.925 --> 14:00.677
Excuse me.

14:01.177 --> 14:04.014
The man is anxious to give me his money.

14:06.016 --> 14:10.437
If you could beat this hand...
...I'll kiss my nose.

14:11.313 --> 14:12.355
Ah...

14:12.772 --> 14:14.941
- Snake!
- Snake! Kill it! Kill it!

14:20.447 --> 14:23.533
Hey come on. What the Hell's going on?

14:26.119 --> 14:28.955
Thought we was playing cards?

14:36.129 --> 14:39.841
You was telling us about...
kissing your nose?

14:39.966 --> 14:42.969
You would have to have to beat
a king high straight.

14:46.389 --> 14:51.728
I guess you better...
...pucker up, man.

14:56.441 --> 14:58.318
Thank you, gentlemen.

14:59.353 --> 15:04.449
Mister. You're the luckiest man alive.
Or the handiest.

15:04.574 --> 15:07.894
- Keep this for me until I get back.
- Where are you going?

15:09.162 --> 15:10.747
Fishing.

16:14.561 --> 16:16.479
Hey, boy!

16:27.407 --> 16:31.786
All we want is a share. We will leave
you plenty.. how about it?

16:31.911 --> 16:35.582
Why draw and die? There
is enough for everyone.

16:35.707 --> 16:39.586
It's only money. In Hell...
..it ain’t even yours.

17:01.774 --> 17:03.443
Kill the bastard!

18:01.292 --> 18:03.363
Hold it. What the hell are you doin'?

18:03.409 --> 18:07.014
What are you shooting at?
Wait until you can see him.

18:31.197 --> 18:33.282
Look out! Snakes!

18:54.137 --> 18:59.027
A man with a cigar in one hand and
a horse in the other can do you no harm.

18:59.076 --> 19:04.847
Seems like those fellas back there had you in
a lot of trouble. Figured I saved your hide.

19:04.872 --> 19:08.832
Would have it done anyway. All you do
is you save me some time.

19:11.279 --> 19:13.739
You're welcome I'm sure...

19:14.323 --> 19:17.577
My momma always taught me manners.

19:17.702 --> 19:19.787
So. How'd yu do.

19:19.912 --> 19:23.666
- My name: Tyree.
- Tyree.

19:24.917 --> 19:27.253
Yeah... I've heard of you.

19:31.757 --> 19:33.593
That's all I need.

19:38.514 --> 19:42.134
I figured it will take some time
to convince you that point, but...

19:42.302 --> 19:46.439
...I'm kinda glad you’d see it right off.

19:48.858 --> 19:54.614
All I see is a fast talking nigger..
..In a fancy shirt.

19:55.407 --> 19:56.918
That it?

19:58.701 --> 20:03.321
Why don't you get back on that horse..
Before your ideas get outta hand?

20:03.446 --> 20:05.416
I figuring on getting rich too.

20:05.541 --> 20:08.920
But my momma always taught me
to look ahead.

20:09.045 --> 20:13.090
Let's say I killed you... took the money...

20:13.215 --> 20:17.929
They would just come looking for me.
But you got the right idea...

20:18.054 --> 20:22.975
...make it to Mexico, spend the
rest of your days spending.

20:23.100 --> 20:26.812
- Is that your proposition?
- You got it.

20:27.932 --> 20:30.661
We ride together from here to Mexico.

20:31.308 --> 20:34.356
I protect your tail.. you watch mine.

20:35.738 --> 20:40.159
- And when we get there?
- Once we cross that big river..

20:40.284 --> 20:42.344
...all bets are off.

20:42.634 --> 20:46.557
- Why should I trust you anymore than them?
- Because they're dead.

20:46.682 --> 20:48.501
And you wanna stay alive.

20:58.844 --> 21:02.807
Dying is way of life for
some people, Tyree.

21:02.932 --> 21:05.935
Make sure you won't have that problem.

21:12.733 --> 21:15.486
You know something, Pike?

21:20.908 --> 21:23.828
We are practically... invisible.

21:24.186 --> 21:30.109
I mean everyone is out looking for only one darky.
And now there is two of us.

21:30.292 --> 21:32.044
How are they gonna know you now?

21:38.697 --> 21:40.750
You always carry a pack of snakes with you?

21:40.885 --> 21:45.126
- That's a story that have never been told.
- Well I've seen you throw snakes...

21:45.251 --> 21:49.581
...but can you shoot?
You'll just have to wait to find out.

22:32.188 --> 22:36.859
Seems like... somebody’s gotta move.

22:41.780 --> 22:42.948
Seems like.

22:43.616 --> 22:48.829
Now friend...
..we can't tell which side you're moving on.

22:48.954 --> 22:52.458
That one or this one?

22:53.959 --> 22:55.711
I haven't made up my mind yet.

23:03.719 --> 23:07.389
You ehh..need any help making up your mind?

23:12.144 --> 23:14.146
Never have.

23:19.860 --> 23:21.737
All right.

23:41.173 --> 23:45.177
He seemed to want something more
from you than just money.

24:10.869 --> 24:12.496
There are they

24:12.621 --> 24:15.457
...lets ride after them!

25:05.797 --> 25:09.011
- Well what do you think?
- They have shown the way.

25:40.626 --> 25:43.879
I still do not know if you can shoot.

26:10.864 --> 26:13.492
Hey, look at them spurs!

26:17.663 --> 26:19.775
Yeah.. these two are shot up pretty bad.

26:19.900 --> 26:22.042
I told you that we were
coming up behind Pike.

26:22.167 --> 26:25.754
Yep, , and so were they.
This one was married.

26:25.879 --> 26:29.174
Too bad his widow ain’t around.

26:33.762 --> 26:38.684
- Are you a gambling man, Pike?
- I do no gambling.

26:52.489 --> 26:56.034
Do you think it's going to be
like that all the way, Pike?

27:05.544 --> 27:09.464
What's wrong? Smell of that
money loosing it sweetness?

27:10.349 --> 27:15.012
Ahh. It's getting sweeter all the time.
It's just like with a woman, Pike.

27:15.137 --> 27:18.306
Once you start to like them.,
Always hungry.

27:21.312 --> 27:25.163
- How about a cigar?
- I do no smokin', neither.

27:26.940 --> 27:31.430
Tell me something. When I'm not near
are you thinking of keeping all that money?

27:33.071 --> 27:38.410
- You mean..eh... splitting with you?
- Now, that ain’t a bad idea.

27:38.744 --> 27:40.746
Well, don't get your hopes up.

27:41.614 --> 27:46.643
You think about it though, don't you Pike? I
mean it wouldn't be natural if you didn't.

27:46.668 --> 27:48.837
You're the same as me.

27:49.504 --> 27:54.676
Maybe... before...
..but..it's different now.

28:21.870 --> 28:23.955
I'm just practicing.

28:27.125 --> 28:28.877
I hope so.

28:32.839 --> 28:37.210
Oh my darling, Oh my darling.

28:37.410 --> 28:42.849
Oh... my dar..ling... Clementine.

28:42.974 --> 28:47.370
You were gone out... Forever.

28:47.998 --> 28:52.567
Dreadful story, Clementine...

28:57.948 --> 28:59.908
Finished?

29:00.033 --> 29:02.994
- I am now.
- Let's go.

29:03.912 --> 29:05.580
Please.

29:21.388 --> 29:24.015
What the hell are you doing?

29:28.853 --> 29:31.815
Shit, Mr! We ain't got nothing.

29:31.940 --> 29:34.697
- You rode with Pike?
- Yeah, but wasn't the only ones...

29:34.822 --> 29:37.195
...I mean he was a lot better than us.

29:37.424 --> 29:43.402
- But little eyes like you gotta see a lot.
- We didn't see nothing, Mr., I swear.

29:43.743 --> 29:48.540
- Are you going after Pike too?
- I might be just the one that's gonna kill him.

29:49.124 --> 29:52.127
Pike he don't die so easy.

29:53.378 --> 29:58.175
The dead is dead, and that's my problem.
You two are gonna ride with me.

29:58.300 --> 29:59.551
Or?

30:01.886 --> 30:04.306
With him.

30:07.142 --> 30:11.855
Hey Pike. You know something?
I've been thinking.

30:11.980 --> 30:15.859
I know why I'm risking my hide.
Why are you doing it?

30:15.984 --> 30:20.280
- Because I told Morgan I would.
- You gave your word to a white man?

30:20.405 --> 30:23.700
Where I come from that ain’t exactly
binding.

30:23.825 --> 30:26.327
Not even 86,000 dollars worth.

30:28.163 --> 30:31.916
I gave my word... to a man.

30:58.693 --> 31:01.362
Help! Arrrgh!

31:15.210 --> 31:16.878
Let go!

31:20.006 --> 31:22.550
Come on. Come on!

31:33.228 --> 31:34.813
Lucas!

31:50.912 --> 31:53.873
- Stop it! What more do you want?
- Get her.

31:53.998 --> 31:56.835
- Stop it!
- Hold her tight!

31:56.960 --> 31:59.003
Help! No!

31:59.879 --> 32:02.757
Feel like being a gentleman?

33:05.570 --> 33:07.405
This your husband?

33:15.705 --> 33:17.498
Where were you headed?

33:19.083 --> 33:22.045
To a little town, near the Rio Grande.

33:22.170 --> 33:25.840
We're headed that way you can ride with us

33:26.924 --> 33:29.719
I'll round up a couple of horses
for you and your friend.

33:29.844 --> 33:35.332
One. He doesn't need.
He was raised by the Tarahuma Indians.

33:36.517 --> 33:40.504
Two blacks, a women and
Indian on foot.

33:40.639 --> 33:43.524
Don't you think anybody is going to
recognize you, Pike?

33:43.649 --> 33:47.661
Now that I know you can shoot, Tyree..
..we won't get no problems.

33:50.114 --> 33:52.533
What's your name, amigo?

33:52.992 --> 33:57.789
His name is Kashtok. He can not
speak. He has no tongue.

34:03.419 --> 34:04.962
Who did that to him?

34:06.005 --> 34:08.716
Men.. like those.

34:23.981 --> 34:28.110
We do not need him. We can
can catch up Pike by ourselves.

34:28.235 --> 34:31.322
Bushwhack him and keep all the money.

34:33.449 --> 34:38.538
He wouldn't give us much anyway.
This way we got it all.

34:38.663 --> 34:41.748
And spend it before he evens knows it.

34:51.759 --> 34:56.764
- You haven't seen a nigger riding by?
- Maybe.

35:02.937 --> 35:04.522
Maybe a couple of them.

35:05.773 --> 35:07.525
Is that right?

35:08.025 --> 35:12.280
- The man says he seen the big nigger.
- Not far up ahead.

35:13.030 --> 35:16.242
Well... that's fine.

35:16.367 --> 35:21.414
- Depends on what you got in mind.
- Sounds like you got something in mind, mister?

35:21.539 --> 35:25.751
If you're gonna go riding out after him,
you are gonna be riding with me... or..

35:25.876 --> 35:28.421
- Or what?
- Or you ain’t riding at all.

35:28.546 --> 35:32.966
- You got some kind of claim on him?
- You could put that way or put it ..

35:33.115 --> 35:35.276
...any way you want it.
I happened to be first in line.

35:35.386 --> 35:38.931
Well, he's is going to move over.

35:55.906 --> 35:57.491
Thank you.

35:59.493 --> 36:03.664
I mean.. for before... what you did.

36:06.667 --> 36:09.709
"Thank you" is very difficult
for you to say isn't it?

36:09.735 --> 36:12.500
I don't think I will
be sorry that I said it.

36:13.702 --> 36:17.261
Well, just thought you might like to talk.

36:18.179 --> 36:20.514
That depends about what.

36:21.390 --> 36:22.767
I don't know.

36:23.434 --> 36:26.354
I thought it might made you feel better.

36:27.813 --> 36:29.523
I came from New Orleans.

36:30.107 --> 36:32.607
And before that France.

36:32.860 --> 36:36.180
You know about the crypt in New
Orleans, where the girls are?

36:36.541 --> 36:37.907
I was there for three years.

36:38.032 --> 36:43.204
Until Lucas, my husband,
came and brought me away with him.

36:45.623 --> 36:48.584
He was a kind and gentle man.

36:48.709 --> 36:52.046
Perhaps you can never
understand, but he did.

36:52.171 --> 36:55.299
He never asked me about
what it was like there.

36:55.424 --> 36:57.885
He didn't have to know.

36:59.053 --> 37:01.153
Lucas made me feel...

37:01.772 --> 37:04.608
Sometimes... almost believed
that it never happened.

37:04.733 --> 37:05.809
Almost?

37:06.769 --> 37:09.105
Is that so strange?

37:09.730 --> 37:13.984
It can happen that a man can trust you. With those
you are carrying without being no doubt before.

37:15.736 --> 37:17.404
Yeah, I know about that.

37:18.823 --> 37:22.026
When my husband found Kashtok
left to die in the desert,..

37:22.151 --> 37:24.931
...he brought him home to care for.

37:25.538 --> 37:27.998
Lucas were that kind of person.

37:28.124 --> 37:29.924
Sound like you loved him.

37:31.669 --> 37:33.212
No.

37:33.337 --> 37:36.507
That was the only thing I
could not give.

37:36.632 --> 37:40.136
I tried, but it was not there.

37:41.512 --> 37:46.642
- Perhaps it is something that I have lost.
- Well..maybe you'll find it again.

37:47.560 --> 37:51.188
Where? Back in the crypts of New Orleans?

37:52.189 --> 37:53.733
No.

37:53.858 --> 37:58.529
I am not going to chase rainbows
...as they say in your country.

37:58.654 --> 38:01.282
- This ain’t my country.
- No?

38:01.949 --> 38:04.785
I was told that you
fought a war about that.

38:29.643 --> 38:31.562
What's she say?

38:33.230 --> 38:37.318
She said that we won the war.

38:38.694 --> 38:42.406
Is that so? Why are they still
shooting at us then?

38:42.531 --> 38:46.141
If they ever stopped, I
figured something is wrong.

38:54.668 --> 38:57.671
She tell you a sad story?

38:58.215 --> 39:00.424
What makes you think so?

39:02.843 --> 39:05.179
It kinda figures, Pike.

39:06.096 --> 39:10.434
I have known a lot of ladies,
Been to a lot of places.

39:11.727 --> 39:14.104
Including New Orleans.

39:15.189 --> 39:18.526
Everybody got sad story
in their past.

39:18.651 --> 39:21.320
Some people more that others.

39:21.445 --> 39:23.530
It ain’t no different.

39:24.406 --> 39:26.867
Don't you ever shut up?

39:28.118 --> 39:31.766
Talking makes me feel... I'm alive.

39:31.891 --> 39:34.124
Lets me know I'm here.

39:37.628 --> 39:40.172
You've always been a loner, Pike?

39:40.297 --> 39:44.885
You kinda got that look in your eye,
tells people to stay away.

39:46.970 --> 39:49.306
Depends on people.

39:51.767 --> 39:55.562
- You don't like me much do you?
- Oh, I like you, Tyree.

39:55.905 --> 39:59.573
But ain’t you the fella that's
gonna try and kill me

39:59.598 --> 40:03.102
...when we cross that river into Mexico?

40:07.324 --> 40:09.910
Yep..that's right, Pike.

40:14.581 --> 40:17.376
I told you that we ain't gonna
find nothin' else.

40:17.501 --> 40:20.212
But you're so Goddamn stubborn!

40:20.337 --> 40:23.507
But you'll eat rabbits if you get
hungry enough!

40:23.632 --> 40:29.054
- So high and mighty.
- I will eat no skunk.

40:31.010 --> 40:33.976
All you have to do...

40:34.101 --> 40:38.752
...is to skin it up, wash it, put it on
the fire, call it " prairie dog."

40:38.877 --> 40:42.484
If we wait for the chicken,
we starve to death.

40:42.609 --> 40:45.612
- I told you.. I don't eat no skunk.
- Hold it!

40:45.737 --> 40:50.409
- Hands up! Where is it?
- I ain’t got it.

40:51.504 --> 40:53.074
Don't make a move.

40:53.370 --> 40:55.494
There were supposed to be only one of them.

40:55.877 --> 40:59.251
The fact is that we are gonna kill
you both in about 3 seconds from now.

40:59.376 --> 41:01.746
- What for?
- The money you got.

41:01.881 --> 41:07.050
What money? We've got 16 cents between us!
But you are welcome to it all...

41:08.552 --> 41:12.898
- Only chicken here!
- Chicken? You son of a bitch!

41:13.023 --> 41:17.868
Skunk is good enough for me,
You got a whole Goddamn chicken.

41:18.003 --> 41:20.147
Hey, neither one of them is him.

41:20.272 --> 41:23.150
And I'm expecting to see 86,000 dollars.

41:23.275 --> 41:24.526
What?

41:24.651 --> 41:28.734
What? You mean there's a nigger
riding around with all that money?

41:28.859 --> 41:31.423
That's right.
Too bad you ain’t him.

41:31.758 --> 41:33.243
Come on, let's go!

41:41.418 --> 41:44.880
You dumb bastard! We got
better things to do!

41:45.005 --> 41:48.759
86,000 dollars!

41:57.851 --> 42:01.230
You see, Mr. Kiefer,
Just like we've been telling you.

42:01.355 --> 42:06.819
Old Pike he's been this way.
He didn't take nothing off these fellas.

42:06.944 --> 42:09.196
Wouldn't take us long.

42:16.224 --> 42:19.851
Lot of stuff here.
He left it all for us.

42:20.786 --> 42:22.216
Ladies things.

42:52.614 --> 42:54.783
When are we gonna get him?

42:55.826 --> 43:00.914
Why hurry? They are only carrying the
money closer to where we can spend it.

45:01.368 --> 45:03.536
Cangey! Look!

45:08.041 --> 45:09.876
Come on!

45:14.714 --> 45:17.300
Don't let them get away!

45:35.568 --> 45:39.838
Come on! We got them now! If we get
across the bridge, we'll be rich men!

45:41.241 --> 45:44.994
They did it! Move your ass!

45:56.256 --> 45:57.424
Hey!

46:08.135 --> 46:11.104
Come on, give me your foot.
Come on.

46:11.813 --> 46:15.284
Hold on.
Do you want me to fall down!

46:15.887 --> 46:17.567
I give you my foot!

46:20.071 --> 46:22.991
More..more..
Come on. Hurry!

46:23.116 --> 46:24.909
Hurry up, come on!

46:25.034 --> 46:28.246
Hold on to my foot.
Hold on to my foot. Don't let go!

46:28.371 --> 46:32.208
Hang on. Up with you. No!

46:47.307 --> 46:51.144
You came because God sent you here.

46:51.853 --> 46:55.648
He means for me to ride on this crusade.

46:56.107 --> 47:00.236
It's not money, Kiefer, it's what
they plan to do with it.

47:00.361 --> 47:01.946
The Devil's work.

47:02.071 --> 47:06.201
Ohh, they claim they will be delivering it,
protecting it for others.

47:06.326 --> 47:10.372
But we know, don't we Kiefer?
But that's a lie.

47:10.497 --> 47:13.833
This is just a test of your purpose.

47:14.250 --> 47:18.421
- Like when I first met you at the end of the war.
- That's right.

47:18.546 --> 47:21.966
Then called us marauders then, didn't they?

47:22.091 --> 47:25.595
Because we no longer obeyed the rules
of war.

47:27.388 --> 47:31.726
But I knew I... I obeyed the rule
of God.

47:31.851 --> 47:37.023
- When I took revenge on His enemies.
- It's coming to you again.

47:39.359 --> 47:42.445
And I hear His call.

47:46.950 --> 47:48.534
Well...

47:49.369 --> 47:51.120
Listen to me...

47:54.791 --> 47:56.709
Do you drink?

48:00.672 --> 48:03.132
Do you chew? (Tobacco)

48:10.526 --> 48:12.558
What about women?

48:13.059 --> 48:16.396
- What about them?
- Well you know, do you... eh...?

48:18.314 --> 48:21.567
They are... sisters in Christ.

48:25.738 --> 48:27.031
Amen, brother.

48:27.156 --> 48:29.325
- Angel.
- Yes, sir.

48:33.413 --> 48:37.542
Sent through the Lord,
His own thunderbolt...

48:37.667 --> 48:42.213
He been given into my hands to
smite the unredeemable sinners.

48:42.338 --> 48:44.424
Show him, Angel.

48:51.542 --> 48:54.401
They are heathens. Black heathens.

48:54.638 --> 48:58.771
Black is the Devil's colors and they
are riding on the Devil's mission.

49:00.440 --> 49:04.778
Goodbye 86,000 dollars.

49:05.225 --> 49:07.080
And it's all your fault.

49:07.215 --> 49:10.450
Because if you done what I told you...

49:11.743 --> 49:15.705
All you know to do is give orders
and complaining.

49:15.830 --> 49:19.000
The best way for us to
do is just..separate.

49:19.125 --> 49:21.919
Oh wait a minute, Cangey.
Don't be that way.

49:22.044 --> 49:24.047
Hey money isn't everything.

49:24.172 --> 49:28.843
Hey listen, Come on you know those two
blankets you wanted? I got them here.

49:28.968 --> 49:30.803
Come on.

49:37.059 --> 49:39.395
Look out! Run!

49:41.147 --> 49:45.067
Goddamn, Cangey, they killed us!

50:03.044 --> 50:05.254
- The money isn't here.
- What?

50:10.334 --> 50:14.614
They looks like them, but there
ain’t 86,000 dollars.

50:15.332 --> 50:16.898
Maybe it's just a story.

50:17.023 --> 50:20.770
No, it's no story.
Everybody knows about it.

50:21.771 --> 50:26.484
- So where's the money?
- We just been following the wrong ones, that's all.

50:26.609 --> 50:30.279
But we've been crossing a lot of trails
all leading to the border.

50:30.404 --> 50:32.615
I figure that's where the money is.

50:33.088 --> 50:35.451
All for the the money.

50:37.828 --> 50:40.832
All of a sudden you got big eyes.

50:40.957 --> 50:44.252
And I was just figuring you were different.

50:44.377 --> 50:47.004
Thinking about joining up
with the other side?

50:47.129 --> 50:51.551
- Do you believe I think about that?
- Oh, yeah.

50:51.676 --> 50:55.325
I forget about your recent bereavement.

50:55.450 --> 51:01.394
I hope I don't mind me saying, but..eh
For a fresh widow and all..

51:02.061 --> 51:04.730
...you don't seem too broken up.

51:05.214 --> 51:09.235
You would prefer that I cry?
Is that what you mean?

51:10.820 --> 51:15.116
I figured a man should always
have someone to weep over him.

51:15.241 --> 51:19.620
- Guess I'm just kinda sentimental.
- Tears are not gonna bring my husband back.

51:19.745 --> 51:23.508
No, but they do have sanctimonious way.

51:23.752 --> 51:26.726
My momma always taught me manners.

51:27.837 --> 51:31.048
- He's talking too much.
- It doesn't matter.

51:31.173 --> 51:36.220
Well, I don’t wanna going in an up fit.
,..but he do what he likes.

51:36.345 --> 51:40.182
And you? What do you like?
The money you carry?

51:40.599 --> 51:42.727
Well, ehh. I'm just holding it.

51:42.852 --> 51:46.314
For a lot of people down in Sonora.
They worked a lot of years for it.

51:46.439 --> 51:50.026
- Are you are taking it to them?
- That's right.

51:50.151 --> 51:52.778
I'm sorry, I didn't understand.

51:53.529 --> 51:59.327
- You are a lucky man.
- Well, It didn't seem that way lately.

51:59.452 --> 52:02.612
You found something worth living for

52:04.457 --> 52:06.042
I envy you.

52:42.953 --> 52:44.663
Come on!

53:39.301 --> 53:42.721
Come on. We gotta get closer. Come on!

54:00.030 --> 54:01.824
In the cave!

56:21.167 --> 56:22.237
Tyree!

56:56.684 --> 56:57.685
Tyree!

57:35.704 --> 57:36.872
Take this.

57:41.960 --> 57:44.546
See if there's a way out.

59:40.662 --> 59:42.831
Come on! Faster!

59:43.498 --> 59:46.167
Faster! Faster!

01:02:13.697 --> 01:02:14.907
Are you crazy?

01:02:43.386 --> 01:02:47.724
Next time you get an idea like that, Pike..
..you keep it to yourself.

01:02:47.849 --> 01:02:50.268
We made it didn't we?

01:02:55.273 --> 01:02:57.191
Let's get out of here.

01:04:01.506 --> 01:04:05.218
- Why has she done it?
- Something you'll never understand.

01:04:05.343 --> 01:04:08.346
- What did you say to her back there?
- I said nothing.

01:04:08.888 --> 01:04:11.812
'Cause she are just looking
for a reason to live.

01:04:12.099 --> 01:04:15.558
Well, she found one...
.. good enough to die for.

01:04:27.824 --> 01:04:30.201
No, no good.

01:04:57.645 --> 01:05:00.231
Guess he ain’t no where to go.

01:05:03.067 --> 01:05:07.530
You haven't come up against them yet.
So you don't know.

01:05:07.655 --> 01:05:11.742
But I do. Also know what you're after,
Kane.

01:05:12.243 --> 01:05:14.370
It's not exactly within the law.

01:05:14.495 --> 01:05:16.725
What we are after is none of your business.

01:05:16.850 --> 01:05:20.305
- Your are not wearing your badge anymore, Kane.
- I don't go anywhere with you.

01:05:20.430 --> 01:05:21.627
You are damn slight smarter.

01:05:21.752 --> 01:05:24.130
When did you start sharing your bounty?

01:05:24.255 --> 01:05:27.175
This time I'll be making an exception.

01:05:27.925 --> 01:05:30.803
Sounds like you're the one
that need help, not me.

01:05:30.928 --> 01:05:35.224
Two niggers and an Indian.
I can handle that myself.

01:05:35.349 --> 01:05:39.270
I've already buried a dozen
men that said the same thing.

01:05:40.021 --> 01:05:43.314
Equal shares to every man
who rides with me.

01:05:43.439 --> 01:05:46.527
You got a few minutes
to make up your minds.

01:05:47.778 --> 01:05:50.228
You can't have my men, Kiefer.

01:05:51.657 --> 01:05:54.160
That's for them to decide.

01:05:54.285 --> 01:05:57.788
It wouldn't be safe to go on without me.

01:06:00.291 --> 01:06:03.711
- Is that a threat?
- That's a fact.

01:06:30.588 --> 01:06:33.783
They shot our wagon to shit...

01:06:33.908 --> 01:06:35.576
Goddamn!

01:06:39.205 --> 01:06:41.499
Won't you ever get tired?

01:06:41.624 --> 01:06:44.544
You never told me about it.

01:06:44.669 --> 01:06:48.839
Save your breath, Tyree.
You're gonna need it.

01:06:50.549 --> 01:06:52.510
We are gonna make it.

01:06:56.305 --> 01:06:59.183
Do you hear me? We are gonna make it!

01:06:59.308 --> 01:07:03.104
Yeah. We... are in the middle of nowhere..

01:07:03.854 --> 01:07:08.150
Not even a Goddamn horse and he
he says we're gonna make it.

01:07:08.275 --> 01:07:12.697
You are seeing butterflies.
Women with... laces.

01:07:13.698 --> 01:07:14.865
Hey.

01:07:15.282 --> 01:07:16.784
What?

01:07:17.368 --> 01:07:18.953
Look. Look!

01:08:04.498 --> 01:08:09.879
- You son of a bitch!
- The men have a right to decide for themselves, Kane.

01:08:10.004 --> 01:08:12.173
They decided to ride with me.

01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:14.875
What are you gonna do?

01:09:08.312 --> 01:09:11.231
I meet up with you in Calvera's camp.

01:09:13.399 --> 01:09:19.073
Are you sure you don't wanna try some?
I don't chew.

01:09:22.368 --> 01:09:25.412
Calvera's camp. Good.

01:09:27.081 --> 01:09:30.084
Good mexican food.

01:09:48.435 --> 01:09:52.524
Hey, Chico, how are you doing? You learned
how to handle that buck I got for you?

01:09:52.660 --> 01:09:53.691
Yes, sir.

01:09:54.858 --> 01:09:57.695
Hello, old man.
It's been a long walk, right?

01:09:57.820 --> 01:09:59.363
Yeah.

01:09:59.863 --> 01:10:04.643
- Do you have two good horses we could buy?
- At least you can ride them.

01:10:14.545 --> 01:10:17.881
Hey, Tyree, there's one for you.

01:10:30.978 --> 01:10:35.149
Hey Tyree, I think you better
try that one..

01:10:38.444 --> 01:10:42.031
Well, old man, how much are you
gonna charge these two miserable thieves?

01:10:42.156 --> 01:10:43.998
They are probably stolen anyway.

01:10:44.123 --> 01:10:47.223
Like only a horse thief would know, senor.

01:11:04.092 --> 01:11:08.625
- This one needs a shoe. We won't get far that way.
- There is a blacksmith in town.

01:11:08.750 --> 01:11:10.059
I'll tend to it myself, Chico.

01:11:10.184 --> 01:11:12.853
Is there a any place in this
town where we can eat and drink?

01:11:12.978 --> 01:11:15.606
Only for those who can pay for it.

01:11:15.731 --> 01:11:18.711
Well, that ain’t no problem,
just see my friend there.

01:11:37.044 --> 01:11:39.963
Where the Hell is that
indian going this time?

01:12:39.272 --> 01:12:40.857
Tequila?

01:13:21.231 --> 01:13:26.778
- You killed many men with this?
- Only if they shot at me first.

01:13:26.903 --> 01:13:32.576
- I wish.. I wish I had a gun.
- Why? Who're you gonna shoot?

01:13:36.203 --> 01:13:38.415
The man who killed my father.

01:14:16.119 --> 01:14:18.705
What are you doing out here, Chico?

01:14:23.043 --> 01:14:25.128
I followed you, senor.

01:14:25.486 --> 01:14:27.371
Well, you better be going
back to the house now

01:14:27.497 --> 01:14:29.516
before you get in trouble
with your grandfather.

01:14:29.517 --> 01:14:34.479
He is not my grandfather.
I just work for him. I have no one.

01:14:39.434 --> 01:14:41.524
It's past your bedtime.

01:16:57.405 --> 01:17:01.117
I never remembered you for 10 years, Pike.

01:17:01.659 --> 01:17:04.412
Well, that took you long enough.

01:17:04.537 --> 01:17:09.417
- Is all the reason you're here?
- You still a wanted man.

01:17:09.542 --> 01:17:11.085
Yeah.

01:17:15.465 --> 01:17:19.219
- What about the money?
- The money stays here!

01:17:52.669 --> 01:17:55.296
10 years ago, I would have shot you.

01:17:55.421 --> 01:17:59.759
But I learned that every man
needs a second chance.

01:18:01.511 --> 01:18:06.099
- That could be your failing, Pike.
- Could be.

01:18:32.959 --> 01:18:38.756
- I'm not surprised that you didn't shoot him.
- That would have been kind of difficult.

01:19:24.719 --> 01:19:27.597
I pay $ 100 a man.

01:19:29.296 --> 01:19:32.018
$ 100 for a two day ride.

01:19:40.167 --> 01:19:42.028
I'm very busy man.

01:19:45.406 --> 01:19:49.660
How much money do they have these men?

01:19:50.119 --> 01:19:51.871
Enough.

01:19:53.372 --> 01:19:55.124
Enough...

01:19:55.792 --> 01:19:57.482
for them...

01:19:58.086 --> 01:20:00.226
for you...

01:20:01.686 --> 01:20:02.934
and... us?

01:20:04.550 --> 01:20:08.304
I need a little more.

01:20:09.514 --> 01:20:13.309
These must very dangerous these men...

01:20:16.312 --> 01:20:19.649
...if you need so many of us to catch them.

01:20:19.774 --> 01:20:22.271
A little challenge for you, isn't it?

01:20:22.933 --> 01:20:26.789
You'll get paid. If you do exactly
as I say.

01:20:27.084 --> 01:20:29.029
Exactly as you say?

01:20:29.408 --> 01:20:33.454
- But you guarantee it?
- You got my word.

01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:37.612
Pfff... your word!

01:20:37.846 --> 01:20:42.964
To us a word is a very valuable thing.

01:20:43.089 --> 01:20:44.257
Good...

01:20:45.591 --> 01:20:49.220
I accept your guarantee.

01:20:49.345 --> 01:20:53.474
We will ride with you and your word.

01:20:53.599 --> 01:20:55.268
But...

01:20:56.561 --> 01:20:58.844
If you don't pay us,

01:20:59.447 --> 01:21:03.573
Then we'll ride after you.

01:22:07.214 --> 01:22:09.175
Did you hear that?

01:22:10.009 --> 01:22:13.262
Now, he's is gonna give 100
dollars to these Mexicans!

01:22:13.387 --> 01:22:17.350
We're not any closer to that money
than we started!

01:22:17.650 --> 01:22:23.522
Look who's here. No drink, no smoke,
no chew. No sleep?

01:22:31.276 --> 01:22:35.785
Someone in the camp!
Mr. Kiefer! Over here!

01:24:11.714 --> 01:24:14.800
Looks like some kind of work camp.

01:24:16.677 --> 01:24:18.220
Yeah.

01:24:33.736 --> 01:24:35.863
I figure this is about as far as we go.

01:24:38.282 --> 01:24:40.542
Kinda thought you’d remember that.

01:24:40.909 --> 01:24:44.413
kept the first half of my promise.

01:24:44.538 --> 01:24:48.375
- Helped you to get here.
- That's right.

01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:51.587
And you are planning on
keeping the rest of it, huh?

01:24:54.757 --> 01:24:58.848
You wouldn’t respect a man who
didn't keep his word now, would you Pike?

01:24:58.973 --> 01:25:04.099
After all..you're the man who
gave his word to Morgan?

01:25:07.378 --> 01:25:11.190
- ain't you had enough fighting?
- ain't the point.

01:25:12.941 --> 01:25:15.211
Do it on foot?

01:25:15.861 --> 01:25:17.655
That's right.

01:25:17.780 --> 01:25:20.157
We do it on foot.

01:25:31.085 --> 01:25:34.820
That's real sneaky, Pike.
Real sneaky.

01:25:34.945 --> 01:25:37.633
I never figured you for a low down
trick like that.

01:25:37.758 --> 01:25:39.898
But I figured you’d.

01:26:29.143 --> 01:26:32.938
Fighting you don't please me, Pike.

01:26:34.648 --> 01:26:36.775
It's the money I want.

01:28:42.150 --> 01:28:43.652
Senor!

01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:47.739
Senor! Senor!

01:28:57.099 --> 01:29:00.502
Senor! They are coming! They are coming!

01:29:00.627 --> 01:29:05.549
- Chico, what's wrong?
- Many of them. An army.

01:29:05.674 --> 01:29:09.594
- Where are they?
- Over there. On the hill.

01:29:44.629 --> 01:29:47.340
Chico, I want you to ride ahead..

01:29:47.465 --> 01:29:50.427
Go to Sonora and ask where
Morgan's ranch is. Do you understand?

01:29:50.552 --> 01:29:53.722
Si, senor. Morgan ranch.
I understand.

01:29:54.187 --> 01:29:56.277
What about the men?

01:29:56.683 --> 01:30:00.645
I'll take care of men.
I'll catch up with you in a little while.

01:30:01.396 --> 01:30:04.158
Now, keep on riding no matter what...

01:30:04.293 --> 01:30:07.527
...and give no one this money except
Mrs. Morgan.

01:30:07.652 --> 01:30:09.154
Chico...

01:30:09.571 --> 01:30:11.448
...you tell her that Pike sent you.

01:30:11.573 --> 01:30:14.711
I tell her that I said to
give you home.

01:30:14.836 --> 01:30:15.808
Si, senor.

01:30:15.933 --> 01:30:17.287
Kashtok.

01:30:18.079 --> 01:30:20.229
You'll go on with him, understand?

01:30:26.588 --> 01:30:28.819
I want you to take care of him.

01:30:38.683 --> 01:30:42.062
- You go too.
- I kind of figured doing that any way.

01:30:42.187 --> 01:30:44.022
Ain't you kinda scared?

01:30:44.940 --> 01:30:47.567
I'll take my chances.

01:30:47.692 --> 01:30:49.110
Amigo!

01:30:53.331 --> 01:30:55.200
G'luck.

01:31:49.554 --> 01:31:53.800
Those are the men with the money?
Then why we've stopped?

01:31:53.925 --> 01:31:56.720
- Not all that simple.
- No?

01:31:56.845 --> 01:32:02.142
To me that dosen't look very hard...
...easier than robbing a bank.

01:32:02.267 --> 01:32:07.138
Lot of dead men thought the same thing.
Move in when I say.

01:32:42.809 --> 01:32:46.686
We ain’t gonna see none of that
money the way he's giving it away.

01:32:46.811 --> 01:32:49.856
Yeah. First there were three of us.
Now there's more than I can count.

01:32:49.981 --> 01:32:53.985
Remember what he said. Dead is dead.

01:32:56.738 --> 01:33:00.158
You ain’t got the guts.

01:33:38.696 --> 01:33:40.615
Mr. Kiefer?

01:33:41.366 --> 01:33:43.534
Mr. Kiefer, sir.

01:33:44.577 --> 01:33:47.789
I heard some talking last night
at Calvera's camp.

01:33:49.624 --> 01:33:52.961
Something you should... know about.

01:33:53.711 --> 01:33:56.673
I don't know who was talking.
I could not see his face.

01:33:56.798 --> 01:34:01.052
I heard someone said he was
gonna shoot you.

01:34:01.380 --> 01:34:03.888
Yeah, shoot you.

01:34:05.306 --> 01:34:07.225
Shoot you in the back.

01:34:23.241 --> 01:34:25.660
I remember now.

01:34:26.411 --> 01:34:28.496
It was Dumper.

01:34:30.415 --> 01:34:32.500
It was his idea.

01:34:34.763 --> 01:34:36.383
I didn't have anything to do with it!

01:35:08.119 --> 01:35:10.909
I figured you might start worrying.

01:35:13.624 --> 01:35:17.378
Oh Hell.. I ain’t figured
you’d give a damn.

01:35:19.630 --> 01:35:21.716
Then I guess we both were wrong.

01:35:26.220 --> 01:35:27.972
Amigo...

01:35:28.473 --> 01:35:31.893
You shouldn't go shoot in the
wrong direction.

01:35:32.018 --> 01:35:35.396
Those we want are there.

01:35:41.152 --> 01:35:43.404
Now, senor Kiefer...

01:35:44.071 --> 01:35:47.200
...I think my men will do it alone.

01:35:47.325 --> 01:35:48.743
Vamoose!

01:35:49.577 --> 01:35:51.245
It's too late.

01:35:51.746 --> 01:35:53.122
No.

01:35:53.247 --> 01:35:55.166
Only for you.

01:35:55.917 --> 01:35:58.002
We don't wait anymore.

01:36:07.678 --> 01:36:10.118
- How many do you figure out there?
- Couldn't be more than 40

01:36:10.181 --> 01:36:13.651
40 against two.
Pretty bad odds.

01:36:18.856 --> 01:36:20.691
For them.

01:36:36.666 --> 01:36:40.419
It's shame that you never had any
of my fine cigars from New Orleans.

01:36:40.544 --> 01:36:43.047
How come you never tried one before, Pike?

01:36:44.215 --> 01:36:46.717
Making a round I was doing no smoking.

01:36:49.637 --> 01:36:52.257
But I guess I will now.

01:37:53.288 --> 01:37:56.954
Haul up there, Tyree!
We've got three seconds!

01:40:45.039 --> 01:40:49.043
Hey, how come you didn't tell me
you couldn't swim?

01:40:49.960 --> 01:40:52.218
You can't do everything perfect, Pike.

01:40:52.343 --> 01:40:55.733
Besides I was just trying to
keep my gun dry.

01:40:59.762 --> 01:41:01.513
Well...

01:41:01.638 --> 01:41:06.560
Are you ready to take
this long hard... Walk?
