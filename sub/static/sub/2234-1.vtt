00:40.880 --> 00:43.963
<i>Earth, before the war.</i>

00:45.600 --> 00:48.729
<i>New York, before I was born.</i>

00:49.840 --> 00:53.845
<i>A place I've only
seen pictures of.</i>

00:54.360 --> 00:55.600
<i>I know you...</i>

00:55.880 --> 00:57.723
<i>But we've never met.</i>

00:59.160 --> 01:00.764
<i>I'm with you...</i>

01:01.720 --> 01:04.325
<i>But I don't know your name.</i>

01:06.240 --> 01:10.768
<i>I know I'm dreaming. But it
feels like more than that.</i>

01:12.440 --> 01:14.761
<i>It feels like a memory.</i>

01:17.040 --> 01:19.088
<i>How can that be?</i>

01:28.880 --> 01:32.168
<i>March 14th, 2077.</i>

01:32.360 --> 01:35.409
<i>Five years since
the mandatory memory wipe.</i>

01:35.560 --> 01:38.530
<i>And I'm still haunted
by these dreams.</i>

01:41.480 --> 01:43.960
<i>Victoria and I were
assigned together.</i>

01:44.160 --> 01:48.484
<i>In two weeks, our mission here will be
finished, and we'll I join the others.</i>

01:49.280 --> 01:52.170
<i>But the questions I ask,
she doesn't.</i>

01:52.320 --> 01:55.324
<i>The things I wonder about,
she won't.</i>

01:56.600 --> 02:00.366
<i>It's been half a century since the
scavengers destroyed our moon.</i>

02:00.520 --> 02:05.003
<i>Forced to leave their own dying
planet, they came to take ours.</i>

02:05.160 --> 02:08.323
<i>Without the moon, the Earth
was thrown into chaos.</i>

02:08.520 --> 02:10.841
<i>Earthquakes toppled
cities within hours.</i>

02:11.520 --> 02:14.330
<i>Tsunamis wiped
out what remained.</i>

02:14.480 --> 02:16.528
<i>Then came the invasion.</i>

02:17.440 --> 02:19.681
<i>We did what we had to do.</i>

02:20.200 --> 02:22.282
<i>We used the nukes.</i>

02:23.840 --> 02:27.447
<i>We won the war,
but lost the planet.</i>

02:27.640 --> 02:31.645
<i>Left it contaminated.
Most of it uninhabitable.</i>

02:32.920 --> 02:36.641
<i>What remained of humanity
had to leave the Earth.</i>

02:37.120 --> 02:40.841
<i>We built the Tet,
our mission control.</i>

02:40.960 --> 02:44.362
<i>A temporary space station
before the migration to Titan,</i>

02:44.560 --> 02:46.562
<i>Saturn's largest moon.</i>

02:46.720 --> 02:48.290
<i>Everyone's there now.</i>

02:48.880 --> 02:51.929
<i>Well, almost everyone.</i>

02:52.640 --> 02:56.645
<i>Until our tour is complete,
Vika and I do our job.</i>

02:56.800 --> 02:58.404
<i>We protect the hydro rigs,</i>

02:58.560 --> 03:00.483
<i>which convert Earth's sea water</i>

03:00.600 --> 03:02.568
<i>into fusion energy
for the new colony.</i>

03:02.720 --> 03:05.166
<i>The survival of humanity
depends on it.</i>

03:10.480 --> 03:11.720
Thank you for the coffee.

03:11.920 --> 03:15.970
<i>Remnants of the scavenger army
continue to disrupt the operation.</i>

03:16.240 --> 03:18.527
<i>They attack our drones
at night,</i>

03:18.640 --> 03:20.927
<i>and try to kill me
during the day.</i>

03:21.320 --> 03:24.244
<i>There's still fight in them,
but I don't know why.</i>

03:25.680 --> 03:28.160
<i>Mission says we have done well.</i>

03:28.520 --> 03:32.002
<i>That we are an effective team.</i>

03:41.920 --> 03:44.207
<i>Vika's my
communications officer.</i>

03:44.360 --> 03:46.362
<i>She keeps an eye on me.</i>

03:47.160 --> 03:49.208
<i>I handle drone maintenance.</i>

03:49.760 --> 03:52.286
<i>The drones watch everything.</i>

03:53.280 --> 03:57.126
<i>Vika can't wait to go.
Me, I'm not so sure.</i>

03:58.960 --> 04:01.122
<i>I can't shake
the feeling that Earth,</i>

04:01.240 --> 04:03.402
<i>in spite of all
that's happened...</i>

04:03.560 --> 04:06.166
<i>Earth is still my home.</i>

04:31.760 --> 04:33.842
Jack Harper, Tech-49.

05:00.600 --> 05:03.001
Morning, Bob.

05:10.480 --> 05:11.845
<i>Tower, comm check.</i>

05:12.040 --> 05:14.850
<i>Drone Maintenance Technician
49, hydro rig support.</i>

05:15.040 --> 05:17.930
All Bubbleship systems
are green.

05:18.080 --> 05:19.127
I'm good to go.

05:19.280 --> 05:21.567
Copy, Tech-49, you're cleared.
Be careful out there.

05:21.720 --> 05:23.688
Always am.
No, you're not.

05:24.120 --> 05:27.841
Yeah, you're right.
I gotta work on that.

05:36.320 --> 05:38.402
All right, Tet's coming
online in 30 seconds.

05:38.560 --> 05:41.723
Relaying hydro rig coordinates now.
Confirm visual.

05:46.360 --> 05:49.682
I got 'em. Hydro rigs
are sucking seawater.

05:51.200 --> 05:52.247
You got 'em, Bob?

05:55.040 --> 05:56.883
Drone 185 looks good.

06:03.920 --> 06:05.684
Jack,
we've got two drones down.

06:07.240 --> 06:08.241
Shit.

06:08.400 --> 06:10.004
Stand by,
Mission coming online.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.082
<i>And we have Tet contact.</i>

06:16.760 --> 06:18.091
Morning, boss.

06:19.360 --> 06:21.442
<i>Tower 49,
this is Mission Control.</i>

06:21.600 --> 06:23.682
<i>How y'all doing
this lovely morning?</i>

06:23.840 --> 06:28.004
Another day in paradise, Sally.
Uploading data now.

06:28.240 --> 06:31.722
49 mission log.
Day 1642, hydro rig support.

06:31.880 --> 06:33.769
I have two...
<i>You have two drones offline.</i>

06:33.920 --> 06:35.763
<i>Perimeter's compromised.</i>

06:35.920 --> 06:38.730
Copy that, relaying to Tech.
Stand by.

06:39.760 --> 06:43.606
Jack, 166 is down in Grid 37.

06:44.280 --> 06:45.566
Linking to beacon now.

06:45.800 --> 06:47.962
<i>You'll go there first.</i>

06:48.120 --> 06:50.771
Got it. On my way.

06:52.920 --> 06:55.321
<i>Mission, Tech-49 is
en route to Grid 37 now.</i>

06:55.480 --> 06:57.528
<i>Can you plug that hole
with Drone 109?</i>

06:57.680 --> 07:01.127
Negative, 109 is in the dock.
Still waiting for parts.

07:01.440 --> 07:03.602
<i>Jack better find those drones
and get 'em flying.</i>

07:03.760 --> 07:05.967
<i>Those rigs can't be
exposed overnight.</i>

07:07.120 --> 07:08.121
Copy that.

07:30.200 --> 07:33.090
<i>Tower,
didn't he fix 166 recently?</i>

07:33.240 --> 07:35.049
Jack has fixed all
the drones recently.

07:35.200 --> 07:36.884
And, if we had the parts
that we've been asking for,

07:37.040 --> 07:38.530
we wouldn't be running
a skeleton crew down here.

07:38.680 --> 07:41.331
<i>Understood.
We're doing the best we can.</i>

07:41.520 --> 07:42.681
<i>Are you an effective team?</i>

07:43.000 --> 07:44.729
We are an effective team.

07:49.040 --> 07:52.283
<i>Your directive today
is to rehabilitate 166</i>

07:52.440 --> 07:54.204
<i>and find 172.</i>

07:54.360 --> 07:55.521
<i>Get 'em flying by sundown,</i>

07:55.680 --> 07:58.570
<i>and I'll buy you two a round of
drinks when you get up to the Tet.</i>

07:58.720 --> 08:00.079
You had better be ready, Sally.

08:00.080 --> 08:01.605
Two weeks now,
we're keeping track.

08:03.680 --> 08:04.681
Okay.

08:06.520 --> 08:08.807
Come on, Bob. Work
with me, here, buddy.

08:16.440 --> 08:17.930
Tech-49?

08:19.080 --> 08:20.570
<i>Tech-49?</i>

08:23.880 --> 08:25.041
<i>Jack?</i>

08:25.560 --> 08:26.561
Copy, Tower.

08:26.720 --> 08:28.563
What happened?
I lost you for a second.

08:28.960 --> 08:30.121
Really?

08:31.640 --> 08:33.244
<i>Coming up on location.</i>

08:46.000 --> 08:47.001
There it is.

08:47.720 --> 08:49.722
I've got multiple scav kills.

08:49.920 --> 08:52.082
Drone 166 put up
a hell of a fight.

08:53.240 --> 08:54.321
Got any movement?

08:54.640 --> 08:57.007
No sign of scavenger activity.

08:57.160 --> 09:00.403
But I've got limited visibility, here,
Jack, due to low angle of Mission.

09:00.600 --> 09:03.251
Copy that.
I'm coming in hot.

09:30.320 --> 09:33.324
Starting repairs.
Watch my back.

09:34.960 --> 09:36.689
I always do.

09:58.960 --> 10:01.327
You know,
I read about this game.

10:04.120 --> 10:06.043
It was played right here.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.490
The last Super Bowl.

10:08.640 --> 10:10.130
Please don't tell me
it was a classic.

10:10.480 --> 10:11.766
A classic game.

10:14.160 --> 10:15.161
Down by four.

10:17.520 --> 10:18.851
<i>The ball</i>

10:19.440 --> 10:21.488
<i>was on the 50-yard line.</i>

10:21.680 --> 10:23.170
<i>Seconds left on the clock.</i>

10:25.320 --> 10:26.970
The ball is snapped,

10:27.800 --> 10:29.211
and the QB fumbles.

10:31.160 --> 10:32.730
Disaster.

10:33.720 --> 10:35.643
Looks like the game is over.

10:37.520 --> 10:39.204
I'm reading the whole
central core off-alignment.

10:39.360 --> 10:41.362
You don't have the necessary
tools down there.

10:41.520 --> 10:43.280
<i>And a new fuel cell is
not going to fix that.</i>

10:46.520 --> 10:49.364
But this QB runs back,
and picks up his own fumble.

10:49.520 --> 10:50.720
Hold on, what did you just do?

10:50.840 --> 10:53.411
<i>There's a wall of linebackers
closing in on him.</i>

10:55.320 --> 11:00.201
<i>So, he throws a long ball with
no idea who is at the other end.</i>

11:00.360 --> 11:02.044
A Hail Mary.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.128
Eighty-thousand people
on their feet,

11:06.240 --> 11:08.402
watching this ball
sail through the air.

11:09.600 --> 11:15.403
Downfield is a rookie wide
receiver, third string.

11:15.720 --> 11:18.041
He just leaps out of the pack.

11:19.720 --> 11:21.609
Touchdown!

11:40.720 --> 11:41.801
Contact! West contact!

11:44.800 --> 11:46.529
<i>Jack?</i>

11:47.120 --> 11:48.246
It's okay, Vika.

11:49.320 --> 11:51.084
It's just a dog.

11:58.360 --> 11:59.361
Hey.

12:00.040 --> 12:01.883
Now, go on. You gotta
get out of here.

12:03.200 --> 12:04.281
Go on, get!

12:04.440 --> 12:06.568
Get out of here! Go!

12:14.960 --> 12:16.769
<i>Tech-49, Jack Harper.</i>

12:43.800 --> 12:45.799
You're welcome.

12:48.640 --> 12:51.769
166 is back online.

12:59.640 --> 13:03.565
Two drones shot down today. Ten fuel
cells stolen in just over a month.

13:03.760 --> 13:06.001
These scavs are getting bolder.

13:06.160 --> 13:08.361
<i>Well, the hydro rigs
are taking all the water.</i>

13:08.680 --> 13:11.411
Once we're gone, they'll have
nothing but dust and radiation.

13:12.160 --> 13:13.844
<i>This is bullshit.</i>

13:14.240 --> 13:15.844
We won the war.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.525
Now we have to leave.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.529
Two more weeks, Jack.

13:23.160 --> 13:25.527
<i>Then we'll be on
our way to Titan.</i>

13:26.840 --> 13:27.841
Yep.

13:29.200 --> 13:31.487
That drone is out
there somewhere.

13:33.360 --> 13:35.044
We just have to find it.

13:35.440 --> 13:38.523
Without a beacon, that's like
finding a needle in a haystack.

13:46.320 --> 13:49.210
So we go to our ground game.

15:30.760 --> 15:34.651
Tower, I've located 172

15:35.400 --> 15:37.562
down a sinkhole.

15:37.720 --> 15:39.802
No visual, but I can hear it.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.082
Tet's so far off angle,
I can barely see you.

15:42.240 --> 15:43.446
How's it look?

15:44.760 --> 15:48.401
It's good, it's good. There's no
sign of scav activity on top.

15:48.560 --> 15:50.608
<i>Tet's offline in 15 minutes.</i>

15:52.000 --> 15:54.480
<i>After that, you're on your own.</i>

16:12.000 --> 16:14.002
<i>Mission, this is Tower 49.</i>

16:14.200 --> 16:18.364
<i>Jack has located drone 172.
Engaged in recovery now.</i>

16:18.520 --> 16:21.922
Requesting backup
to his location ASAP.

16:50.640 --> 16:53.007
I've got a visual on Drone 172.

16:53.840 --> 16:55.046
Jack?

18:01.000 --> 18:02.764
What the hell?

18:07.040 --> 18:08.371
Shit.

19:04.280 --> 19:05.361
Ha!

19:48.200 --> 19:49.201
Jack!

20:20.200 --> 20:22.282
Tech-49,
Jack Harper.

20:25.240 --> 20:27.607
Jack Harper, Tech-49!

20:29.160 --> 20:30.161
Hey!

21:16.360 --> 21:18.522
Oh, no.

21:20.320 --> 21:23.961
Come on.
Not my goddamn bike!

22:28.760 --> 22:32.128
"How can a man die
better Than facing fearful odds"

22:32.280 --> 22:35.363
"For the ashes of his fathers
And the temples of his Gods"

22:35.560 --> 22:36.721
Jack?

22:38.080 --> 22:40.526
Yep, I'll be right there.

22:57.720 --> 22:59.722
<i>How does 109 look?</i>

22:59.880 --> 23:00.959
Can it fly?

23:00.960 --> 23:02.724
Barely.

23:02.880 --> 23:06.441
And without armor,
she's a sitting duck.

23:06.600 --> 23:09.604
Well, I'll talk to Sally about
that shielding in the morning.

23:09.800 --> 23:10.879
Okay.

23:10.880 --> 23:11.959
Again.

23:16.800 --> 23:20.202
What, Jack Harper?

23:27.840 --> 23:29.649
Where did you get this?

23:29.840 --> 23:31.205
It was growing in...

23:46.480 --> 23:47.719
Come on, Jack,
you know the regulations.

23:47.720 --> 23:48.960
I know you think I'm a stickler

23:49.080 --> 23:50.439
but you have no idea
what kind of toxins

23:50.440 --> 23:52.488
could be in something
like that.

23:53.200 --> 23:54.279
It's a flower, Vika.

23:54.280 --> 23:55.486
Yeah, that's not the point.

23:56.240 --> 23:57.680
It's that we are
so close to the end,

23:57.800 --> 24:00.565
and the last thing that we need
is you putting it all at risk.

24:02.520 --> 24:04.090
Okay.

24:07.640 --> 24:09.768
Every day,
you have to go down there

24:10.800 --> 24:13.565
and see what was lost.

24:14.520 --> 24:17.205
But we've done our job, Jack.

24:20.720 --> 24:22.882
It's time to go.

24:28.880 --> 24:32.089
I don't think they were
trying to kill me today.

24:32.600 --> 24:34.204
The scavs.

24:39.280 --> 24:41.169
They were trying to catch me.

24:45.800 --> 24:48.451
Well, they can't have you.

25:04.720 --> 25:06.051
Come on.

26:03.040 --> 26:06.123
You should come with me
sometime, before we leave.

26:07.680 --> 26:11.241
There's a place I found
I'd like to show you.

26:15.120 --> 26:17.361
I'll show you something.

26:19.320 --> 26:20.924
Hey, hey!

27:42.680 --> 27:45.001
Oh, my God.

27:52.880 --> 27:56.726
<i>It was</i> a <i>six-stage meltdown
from inside the hydro rig's core.</i>

27:57.040 --> 27:58.530
<i>It's offline permanently.</i>

27:58.680 --> 28:01.445
<i>Tower 49, you have put
the whole operation at risk.</i>

28:01.600 --> 28:03.682
<i>I need to know
exactly what happened.</i>

28:03.840 --> 28:06.571
<i>Jack believes the scavs
weaponized one of the stolen fuel cells</i>

28:06.720 --> 28:08.768
<i>and got it into the suction.</i>

28:08.920 --> 28:10.365
<i>Tower, hold.</i>

28:11.720 --> 28:16.089
Tower, I've got a rogue signal in Grid 37.
Are you seeing this?

28:16.240 --> 28:17.571
Yes.

28:17.680 --> 28:19.364
<i>It's gotta be scav.</i>

28:19.880 --> 28:21.564
It's not one of ours.

28:21.760 --> 28:25.731
Jack, the signal is
being directed off-planet.

28:26.400 --> 28:27.765
On my way.

28:28.720 --> 28:33.089
<i>Tower, our logs show you are missing
an additional nine fuel cells.</i>

28:33.240 --> 28:34.319
<i>Can you confirm?</i>

28:34.320 --> 28:36.482
Negative, Mission,
that number is 10.

28:36.960 --> 28:39.042
Drone 172 was lost last night.

28:39.560 --> 28:43.087
109 is combat-ready as soon
as we get that shielding.

28:43.480 --> 28:45.323
We can cover the remaining
rigs with drones in the field.

28:45.440 --> 28:46.441
I've run the numbers.

28:46.600 --> 28:48.443
<i>We'll do the numbers up here,
Tower.</i>

28:48.600 --> 28:51.046
<i>I'm tasking the drones
to defensive positions.</i>

28:51.680 --> 28:52.759
Copy.

28:52.760 --> 28:56.199
<i>Our job is to run those rigs. Your
directive is to protect them.</i>

28:56.200 --> 29:00.039
<i>We cannot afford to lose another.
Do you copy?</i>

29:00.040 --> 29:01.041
Copy.

29:01.240 --> 29:03.288
<i>Are you and Jack
an effective team?</i>

29:03.440 --> 29:04.566
Damn right we are.

29:14.760 --> 29:16.489
Jack?

29:16.640 --> 29:19.120
You're right on top of it.
Do you have a visual?

29:20.960 --> 29:22.559
<i>Jack?</i>

29:22.560 --> 29:24.722
Yeah, I got it.

31:09.600 --> 31:12.922
They have some kind
of a repeater.

31:13.080 --> 31:17.529
The scavs are using
the building as an antenna.

31:17.680 --> 31:18.681
Can you decrypt?

31:23.280 --> 31:25.044
It's a set of coordinates.

31:25.680 --> 31:27.284
<i>Grid 17.</i>

31:27.520 --> 31:29.409
<i>It's a goddamn homing beacon.</i>

31:29.560 --> 31:30.766
Grid 17.

31:31.200 --> 31:32.361
What the hell is out there?

31:36.000 --> 31:38.207
Nothing.
It's the middle of nowhere.

31:39.200 --> 31:41.123
<i>What is going on?</i>

31:41.280 --> 31:45.410
Why would the scavs send
a signal off-planet, Jack?

31:47.120 --> 31:48.645
I'm shutting it down.

32:01.520 --> 32:04.490
Tech-49, check your course. You're
headed right for the border.

32:05.760 --> 32:09.128
<i>That radiation will cook you from
the inside before you know it.</i>

32:09.320 --> 32:11.288
It's okay, Vika.
I see it.

32:13.720 --> 32:17.725
I'm gonna do a perimeter check
before I head home.

32:19.120 --> 32:21.248
I may go off-comm.

32:21.400 --> 32:22.679
Jack,
we should keep in contact.

32:22.680 --> 32:23.920
Just let me know where you are.

32:25.440 --> 32:27.090
<i>Do you copy?</i>

32:28.360 --> 32:30.124
<i>Jack, do you copy?</i>

32:38.000 --> 32:40.002
That's right, Bob.

32:40.760 --> 32:42.524
You know where we're going.

34:24.120 --> 34:25.406
Are you gonna miss me?

34:34.760 --> 34:36.808
I'm gonna miss this place.

34:38.120 --> 34:40.327
It would have been great.

34:47.800 --> 34:49.962
It would have been great.

35:54.720 --> 35:56.688
<i>Vika? Vika,
did you get that?</i>

35:56.880 --> 35:58.370
<i>Jack, where have you been?</i>

35:58.520 --> 36:00.488
An object came down in 17.

36:00.640 --> 36:02.039
That's the beacon coordinates.

36:02.040 --> 36:03.159
Exactly.

36:03.160 --> 36:05.003
<i>I saw it.
Some sort of vessel.</i>

36:05.160 --> 36:06.571
Jack, Mission's almost offline.

36:06.720 --> 36:08.370
<i>I'm en route now.</i>

36:09.320 --> 36:11.721
Mission, we have an unidentified
object impact in 17.

36:11.880 --> 36:14.042
It came down at coordinates
sent by a scav beacon.

36:14.200 --> 36:15.201
My tech's en route now.

36:15.400 --> 36:17.562
<i>Tower,
we're going offline soon,</i>

36:17.680 --> 36:19.842
<i>but drones are already
mobile and executing.</i>

36:20.000 --> 36:21.729
<i>Have your tech stand down.</i>

36:21.880 --> 36:23.325
Copy.

36:23.720 --> 36:25.848
Jack, Mission wants you to stand down.
The drones will handle it.

36:26.000 --> 36:27.650
<i>That's a negative, Tower.</i>

36:27.800 --> 36:30.087
With Tet offline,
we need our eyes on this.

36:30.240 --> 36:32.083
I want to know
this site is secure.

36:35.200 --> 36:37.559
Sally, my tech's concerned about
the security of the site.

36:37.560 --> 36:39.881
<i>Tower, you have lost
enough assets for today.</i>

36:40.040 --> 36:42.008
<i>Keep your tech out of there.
Do you copy?</i>

36:42.160 --> 36:43.400
Copy, Command, I'm...

36:48.760 --> 36:51.923
Jack, Command wants you to stand down.
The drones will handle this.

36:52.080 --> 36:53.684
<i>I'm on site.</i>

36:54.080 --> 36:55.081
<i>Jack.</i>

36:55.240 --> 36:57.925
<i>I don't have eyes on you.
Command's offline.</i>

36:58.080 --> 37:01.050
Vika, I think it's one of ours.

37:03.520 --> 37:05.284
This thing is ancient.
It looks...

37:06.040 --> 37:07.280
...pre-war.

37:07.440 --> 37:09.761
The scavs brought
this thing down, Jack.

37:09.920 --> 37:11.251
There's no sign of scavs.

37:11.400 --> 37:12.765
<i>Technician,
this is your Control.</i>

37:12.920 --> 37:16.083
I'm ordering you to pull out and
return to the tower immediately.

37:17.600 --> 37:19.443
Touching down.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.764
They're human.

38:05.600 --> 38:08.763
Tower, we have got survivors.

38:10.000 --> 38:13.925
There are four...
Check it, five survivors.

38:14.680 --> 38:16.011
They are human.

38:48.720 --> 38:49.960
Stand down!

38:50.120 --> 38:52.088
Vika, the drones are
firing on survivors.

38:52.240 --> 38:55.767
Jack, the Tet's offline.
I don't have control.

38:55.920 --> 38:57.046
Stand down!

39:04.600 --> 39:07.649
<i>Jack Harper, Tech-49.</i>

39:14.800 --> 39:16.882
<i>Back off, you son of a bitch!</i>

39:24.240 --> 39:25.844
<i>Back off!</i>

40:32.360 --> 40:34.328
Open the door.

40:36.680 --> 40:38.205
Vika!

40:51.960 --> 40:53.246
Get the med kit.

40:54.360 --> 40:56.362
Get the med kit!

41:10.000 --> 41:11.047
This has to be reported.

41:11.200 --> 41:12.599
Be sure and report
that the drones

41:12.600 --> 41:14.240
killed the crew from
one of our own ships.

41:14.640 --> 41:16.051
See what Command makes of that.

41:23.880 --> 41:26.167
It's breathing fluid.
Just let her get it out.

41:37.520 --> 41:38.521
Jack.

42:05.080 --> 42:07.606
Here.
You're still dehydrated.

42:22.600 --> 42:24.682
Where are we?

42:25.000 --> 42:27.446
I'm Victoria, this is Jack.

42:31.880 --> 42:34.008
What's your name?

42:36.360 --> 42:37.725
I'm Julia.

42:38.320 --> 42:39.606
Julia...

42:39.760 --> 42:43.082
I'm sorry for what
I have to tell you,

42:43.400 --> 42:45.289
but you were in a crash.

42:46.440 --> 42:48.204
Your ship came down.

42:49.320 --> 42:51.641
Jack managed to pull you
from the wreckage.

42:53.240 --> 42:54.969
But none of your crew survived.

43:03.000 --> 43:04.286
What do you mean?

43:04.800 --> 43:06.848
You're the only one
that made it.

43:10.000 --> 43:11.570
I'm sorry.

43:19.040 --> 43:22.283
You've been in delta sleep
for a long time.

43:24.200 --> 43:26.646
Some disorientation is normal.

43:26.800 --> 43:28.131
How long?

43:32.520 --> 43:34.170
Sixty years.

43:34.320 --> 43:36.004
At least.

43:46.800 --> 43:49.406
I have to get back to our ship.

43:55.320 --> 43:58.563
It's too dangerous down there.
You need to rest.

44:09.040 --> 44:10.201
Vika...

44:12.720 --> 44:14.370
Don't touch me.

44:18.120 --> 44:23.047
Your ship's re-entry was triggered
by a beacon from the surface.

44:24.200 --> 44:25.531
Do you know
anything about that?

44:34.880 --> 44:35.881
What was your mission?

44:38.920 --> 44:40.285
It's classified.

44:40.600 --> 44:41.886
Well, we have
no record of an <i>Odyssey...</i>

44:42.040 --> 44:43.319
I can't tell you anything

44:43.320 --> 44:45.080
until I get the flight
recorder from my ship.

44:45.320 --> 44:49.245
Julia, a lot has
changed in 60 years.

44:56.280 --> 44:58.089
While you were in delta sleep,

44:59.000 --> 45:00.445
Earth was attacked.

45:01.960 --> 45:03.962
Call them scavs.

45:05.160 --> 45:09.609
They destroyed our moon and
with that, half the planet.

45:11.400 --> 45:13.402
Then they invaded.

45:13.600 --> 45:15.090
We won the war,

45:15.960 --> 45:17.689
but Earth was ruined.

45:18.800 --> 45:21.007
Everyone's on Titan now.
It's a moon of Saturn.

45:21.160 --> 45:25.449
Or on the space station,
getting ready to go.

45:27.440 --> 45:31.445
We're here for security
and drone maintenance.

45:32.800 --> 45:35.531
We're the mop-up crew.

45:56.280 --> 45:58.328
You've lost people.

45:59.800 --> 46:00.961
Everything.

46:04.240 --> 46:06.720
If you want to be alone,
we understand.

46:18.880 --> 46:22.487
The drones killed
her entire crew.

46:25.480 --> 46:26.641
If I hadn't gotten there...

46:26.840 --> 46:28.365
I want her gone first thing.

46:28.520 --> 46:29.931
Vika...

46:31.480 --> 46:34.882
Do you have any memories
before the mission?

46:36.320 --> 46:38.687
Before the security wipe?

46:40.440 --> 46:42.886
Our job is not to remember.

46:44.560 --> 46:45.891
Remember?

46:46.560 --> 46:48.210
Do you remember her?

46:53.400 --> 46:54.401
Jack...

46:55.360 --> 46:59.365
That was a scav beacon
that brought her down.

47:00.600 --> 47:03.285
We don't know who she is.

47:05.040 --> 47:06.451
Or what she is.

47:09.520 --> 47:11.727
Let's just get
through the night.

47:12.040 --> 47:13.724
Okay?

47:51.920 --> 47:53.570
You fly that thing?

47:55.360 --> 47:56.725
Yes.

48:00.400 --> 48:02.289
What happens now?

48:04.640 --> 48:06.768
The Tet will be online soon.

48:06.920 --> 48:10.242
Victoria will
report your rescue.

48:11.040 --> 48:13.327
They'll send
someone down for you.

48:14.600 --> 48:16.284
From the Tet?

48:17.080 --> 48:18.286
Yes.

48:22.120 --> 48:24.566
I need to get the flight
recorder from my ship.

48:25.960 --> 48:28.440
The scavs, they move at night.

48:29.080 --> 48:30.599
They could be
all over it by now.

48:30.600 --> 48:32.523
I need to know what happened.

48:35.120 --> 48:36.929
You need to know what happened.

48:38.800 --> 48:40.643
Please.

49:03.640 --> 49:05.130
Jack?

49:05.280 --> 49:07.328
Jack, what are you doing?

49:07.480 --> 49:08.766
Vika, she's a flight officer.

49:08.960 --> 49:12.203
She wants to see her ship and
secure the flight recorder.

49:12.360 --> 49:13.850
Now, you would
want the same thing.

49:14.000 --> 49:15.684
<i>Jack, I...</i>

49:17.960 --> 49:20.486
I can't protect you.

49:23.000 --> 49:24.843
No, I understand.

49:27.480 --> 49:29.642
This one's on me.

50:12.360 --> 50:13.930
I couldn't save them.

50:25.560 --> 50:27.449
Jack. Jack!

50:32.120 --> 50:33.565
Jack, can you hear me?

51:06.920 --> 51:08.570
All right, it's time to go.

51:08.720 --> 51:10.131
Jack.

51:10.960 --> 51:12.485
I found it.

51:24.760 --> 51:25.799
Jack!

52:31.520 --> 52:34.205
<i>Tower 49, how are y'all
this lovely morning?</i>

52:34.800 --> 52:36.962
Another day in paradise.

52:38.400 --> 52:39.401
Sally...

52:40.600 --> 52:45.208
Jack took a pre-dawn patrol

52:45.360 --> 52:49.001
and went off-comm

52:51.200 --> 52:54.170
near the canyons in 17.

52:54.560 --> 52:57.530
Now,
I know we're low on drones,

52:57.680 --> 53:03.323
but, um, requesting one
to sweep the area.

53:06.520 --> 53:08.409
Just a quick scout.

53:08.880 --> 53:13.647
<i>Copy 49,
tasking 185 to Grid 22.</i>

53:47.760 --> 53:50.923
"And how can a man die
better Than facing fearful odds"

53:51.720 --> 53:54.564
"For the ashes of his fathers"

53:54.720 --> 53:57.610
"And the temples of his Gods"

54:13.960 --> 54:16.440
I've been watching you, Jack.

54:17.240 --> 54:19.481
You're curious.

54:19.640 --> 54:21.847
What are you looking
for in those books?

54:23.360 --> 54:26.125
Do they bring
back old memories?

54:26.320 --> 54:28.641
You won't get anything from me.

54:28.800 --> 54:30.484
My memory has been
wiped to protect...

54:30.640 --> 54:33.564
...the security of
the mission. Yes.

54:35.000 --> 54:37.119
You can't have
your precious memory

54:37.120 --> 54:39.441
falling into the wrong
hands, now, can you?

54:40.800 --> 54:42.245
Tell me.

54:42.400 --> 54:46.769
Have you ever met
a scav up close?

54:48.560 --> 54:52.485
Of course not.
You just repair drones.

54:53.120 --> 54:55.248
"Don't go into
the radiation zone."

54:56.320 --> 54:59.483
"Don't ask too
many questions."

54:59.680 --> 55:04.368
Not part of
the job description.

55:05.200 --> 55:06.247
Lights.

55:30.360 --> 55:32.203
We're not alien, Jack.

55:32.880 --> 55:34.291
We're human.

55:35.200 --> 55:38.488
Of course, for us,
being human is a problem.

55:43.000 --> 55:46.846
Old stealth fighter tech.
Shields us from your scanners.

55:47.000 --> 55:48.843
Vocal scrambling.

55:49.400 --> 55:51.080
Can you hear me, Jack?

55:51.880 --> 55:54.690
Keeps your drones confused.

55:55.000 --> 55:58.561
Well, most of the time.

55:59.000 --> 56:00.239
The drones are programmed...

56:00.240 --> 56:01.844
To kill humans, Jack.

56:02.080 --> 56:05.050
You saw what they did
to those sleep pods.

56:05.480 --> 56:09.405
You almost got yourself blown
to bits protecting that woman.

56:14.200 --> 56:15.690
Why did you do that?

56:16.960 --> 56:18.610
Anyone would have.

56:18.760 --> 56:19.966
"Anyone."

56:21.640 --> 56:22.641
Interesting.

56:22.800 --> 56:24.290
We're wasting our time.

56:24.920 --> 56:26.763
The drone will track him here.

56:26.920 --> 56:28.080
That's Sergeant Sykes.

56:28.960 --> 56:32.407
He thinks I'm a fool for
having brought you here.

56:38.320 --> 56:40.368
I hope you prove him wrong.

56:51.880 --> 56:53.119
Mission,
I'm picking up a bio trail

56:53.120 --> 56:54.439
somewhere near
the west canyons.

56:54.440 --> 56:55.930
Can you confirm the sequence?

56:56.080 --> 56:57.411
<i>Stand by.</i>

56:59.320 --> 57:01.527
<i>DNA confirmed.
It's Jack.</i>

57:04.280 --> 57:06.169
<i>Vika, are you okay?</i>

57:06.440 --> 57:08.886
<i>Everything good
between you two?</i>

57:09.120 --> 57:10.485
Of course.

57:10.640 --> 57:12.961
<i>You're still an effective team?</i>

57:13.280 --> 57:15.089
We're great.

57:16.640 --> 57:17.880
Never better.

57:18.080 --> 57:20.401
<i>We were running
a ground game, and losing.</i>

57:20.560 --> 57:22.801
So, we decided,
"What the hell?"

57:23.000 --> 57:25.287
"We've got to
throw the long ball."

57:25.440 --> 57:28.842
It took us decades just
to crack the GPS codes.

57:29.000 --> 57:31.651
That's how you brought
down the Odyssey.

57:33.920 --> 57:35.410
Why?

57:36.480 --> 57:40.041
The <i>Odyssey's</i> compact
reactor, courtesy of NASA.

57:40.200 --> 57:42.771
Very hard to come by.

57:44.240 --> 57:47.323
Did you like
the show last night?

57:49.720 --> 57:53.088
That was just one fuel cell.

57:53.280 --> 57:56.204
Imagine what 10
of them will do,

57:56.360 --> 58:00.524
with a core of
weapons-grade plutonium.

58:00.680 --> 58:05.083
We have a nuke, and we
have a drone to carry it.

58:05.240 --> 58:09.211
But we can't access it.
It doesn't know who we are.

58:11.360 --> 58:13.840
But it knows you, Jack.

58:20.520 --> 58:23.126
We need you to
program the drone.

58:23.960 --> 58:26.884
Have it carry our
nuke up to the Tet.

58:32.560 --> 58:34.130
End this war.

58:38.040 --> 58:39.804
There are people up there.

58:42.120 --> 58:43.121
Sergeant.

58:43.440 --> 58:46.887
Program the drone
to return to the Tet.

58:47.720 --> 58:51.008
It needs to go
right to the center.

58:52.480 --> 58:54.084
Screw you.

58:56.760 --> 58:57.921
We haven't got time for this.

59:23.640 --> 59:24.766
Hey. Hey!

59:36.800 --> 59:37.801
No.

59:44.800 --> 59:45.961
Let's go!
Get him up.

01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:44.840
Mission,
185 just went off-grid.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.968
<i>Copy, Tower,
we're seeing the same thing.</i>

01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:49.686
Permission to task
two additional drones?

01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:54.046
If one drone is here,
more will come.

01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:57.406
And they won't stop
until they find me.

01:00:57.560 --> 01:00:59.881
They'll turn
this place to dust.

01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:03.171
But if you let us go,
I'll call them off.

01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:09.850
It's your only chance.

01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:26.842
I've been to your

01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:29.402
"radiation zones."

01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:32.244
If you're looking
for the truth,

01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:35.927
that's where you'll find it.

01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:53.048
You've risked all our lives.
Everything.

01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:56.285
What makes you
think he's different?

01:01:57.760 --> 01:01:59.046
She does.

01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:59.001
<i>Mission, I've found
my tech over in 37.</i>

01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:00.650
<i>You can call off the search.</i>

01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:03.326
<i>Copy that, Tower.
Glad Jack's safe.</i>

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:06.609
<i>Tasking the other drones
back to rig support.</i>

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.367
Where are we going now?

01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:35.964
Who are you?

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.401
What aren't you telling me?

01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:43.685
Jack, I...

01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:45.530
What were you
doing on the <i>Odyssey?</i>

01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:48.403
What was your mission?

01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:55.246
It was a research flight
to Titan. My first.

01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:58.890
That's what it was
supposed to be.

01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:05.722
Six weeks to launch, deep space
scanners picked up an alien object.

01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:08.406
We were reassigned
to investigate.

01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:10.486
They put us all in delta.

01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:14.565
They must have woken
you and Victoria first.

01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:20.286
What?

01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:22.408
That object

01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:24.562
was the Tet, Jack.

01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:28.483
The Tet was our mission.

01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:33.962
That's impossible.

01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:36.445
That's impossible!

01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:39.003
Who are you?

01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:44.083
I'm your wife.

01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:53.284
I don't know what happened, but
you're not who you think you are.

01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:04.327
Jack, we were here.

01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:09.684
You asked me to meet you, brought
me up on top of the world.

01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:18.130
I could tell
you were nervous that day.

01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:20.967
It was right here, Jack.

01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:27.644
You said,

01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:29.962
"Look through here,

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.720
and I'll show you the
future."

01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:36.844
And I held up a ring.

01:05:57.680 --> 01:05:58.841
And you said...

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.570
"Yes."

01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:09.882
There you are.

01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:14.168
There you are.

01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:39.401
Hi.

01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:41.449
Hello.

01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:45.805
Come on.

01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:50.527
<i>Vika, I'm coming in.</i>

01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:55.930
<i>Do not report to Mission until I get back.
Do you copy?</i>

01:07:56.800 --> 01:07:58.245
<i>Do you copy?</i>

01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:17.680
Vika, open the door.

01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:20.002
Stay away from me.

01:08:21.279 --> 01:08:23.009
I don't want to hear it.

01:08:23.359 --> 01:08:26.841
It's not safe here,
and we need to leave, now.

01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:32.443
It was always her.

01:08:35.359 --> 01:08:36.691
Wasn't it?

01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:39.211
Vika...

01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:46.488
She's my wife.

01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:04.685
Mission, this is Tower 49.

01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:06.205
<i>Go ahead, 49.</i>

01:09:06.359 --> 01:09:07.725
No.

01:09:08.279 --> 01:09:10.328
I'm having a problem
with my technician.

01:09:10.479 --> 01:09:12.243
No, you don't know
what you're doing.

01:09:12.399 --> 01:09:14.050
He found a survivor
at the crash site.

01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:15.238
You've gotta listen to me.

01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:17.402
She's impeding his abilities,

01:09:18.279 --> 01:09:20.328
and he is unfit for service.

01:09:20.479 --> 01:09:21.810
No, no, no.

01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:24.691
<i>I'm sorry to hear that, Vika.</i>

01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:27.207
<i>Are you still
an effective team?</i>

01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:29.286
Vika...

01:09:29.439 --> 01:09:31.169
Open the goddamn door, Vika!

01:09:31.439 --> 01:09:33.044
No.

01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:39.238
We are not an effective team.

01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:04.090
Vika, please.
We have to go now.

01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:06.561
I'm not going anywhere
with you, Jack.

01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:10.242
There's a place I know.
We'll be safe.

01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:12.565
I'm going to Titan.

01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:16.201
There is no Titan.

01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:18.325
They lied to us.

01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:20.807
Just stay away from me.

01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:25.249
Vika, please,
there are things...

01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:26.447
Things you need to know.

01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:28.443
I don't want to know!

01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:33.921
Jack...

01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:17.361
<i>Hi, Jack. I don't believe
we've had the pleasure.</i>

01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:20.371
What have you done?

01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:24.286
<i>You can't blame yourself for this.
Drones are unreliable.</i>

01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:26.363
<i>Sometimes things go wrong.</i>

01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:29.089
"Go wrong"?

01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:33.251
You killed her.

01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:38.281
<i>I know, it's tragic.
She was a wonderful person.</i>

01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:41.643
<i>Jack, we want to bring you in.</i>

01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:44.481
<i>I've been
authorized to tell you</i>

01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:46.807
<i>we're going to
assign you a new mission.</i>

01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:48.849
<i>You and the survivor.</i>

01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:58.649
<i>There's</i> a <i>lot of interest up here.
Bring her up.</i>

01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:02.282
<i>We can debrief,
then anything's possible.</i>

01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:05.525
<i>It's time to come home, Jack.</i>

01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:08.004
<i>Jack?</i>

01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:09.885
<i>Jack?</i>

01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:22.081
Jack...

01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:26.205
I'm sorry.

01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:40.245
Hang on.

01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:02.201
Lightning.

01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:03.761
That's the plan.

01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:40.520
We need cover.

01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:42.646
There.

01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:31.483
Are you okay?
No.

01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:43.924
Don't worry,
we're staying out of there.

01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:54.441
Are we gonna die?

01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:55.601
No!

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:00.365
Maybe.

01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:02.601
Jack!

01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:44.688
Son of a bitch.

01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:53.761
Wait here.

01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:34.445
Who is it?

01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:15.005
Hey!

01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:17.011
Wait!

01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:19.170
Wait!

01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:20.970
Hey!

01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:40.726
Drop your weapon!

01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:58.004
It's okay.

01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:02.806
Don't move!

01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:09.290
We have to shut
that drone down.

01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:12.441
Stop moving!

01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:13.687
Jack!

01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:22.089
It's okay.

01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:44.405
Julia.

01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:48.370
Julia!

01:20:57.760 --> 01:20:58.761
Don't.

01:20:59.080 --> 01:21:01.401
Don't touch me.

01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:20.206
Hold on.

01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:22.330
Just hold on.

01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:56.643
Jack Harper, Tech-52.

01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:07.644
Hey.

01:23:07.800 --> 01:23:09.529
There you are.

01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:15.045
What happened?
Are you okay?

01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:18.603
That bogey came across the
border and then I lost you.

01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:22.481
False alarm.

01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:28.485
I should get back out there.

01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:32.169
You come all the way home,
and I don't get a kiss?

01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:45.082
What's going on up there?

01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:48.408
I was thinking...

01:23:49.560 --> 01:23:51.403
Why don't you
come down with me?

01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:54.560
To the surface?

01:23:54.840 --> 01:23:56.649
We could go right now.

01:23:57.040 --> 01:23:58.565
Now?

01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:00.487
Yeah.

01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:03.010
Are you serious?

01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:05.686
You won't believe
what's down there.

01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:11.929
Jack...

01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:14.729
You know the regulations.

01:24:15.720 --> 01:24:17.085
Yes.

01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:22.770
Can we not do this again?
I'm done talking about it.

01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:26.365
Okay.

01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:16.889
This is gonna hurt.

01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:30.327
Hell of a day, huh, Bob?

01:26:55.920 --> 01:26:57.843
You always loved this song.

01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:03.450
I'm not him.

01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:08.284
I know I'm not.

01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:13.568
But I've loved you...

01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:18.522
...for as long
as I can remember.

01:27:19.960 --> 01:27:22.406
I don't know
how else to say it.

01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:30.406
You know what
you said to me once?

01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:36.090
You said when it was all over, you
would build me a house on a lake.

01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:42.806
We would grow old
and fat together.

01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:45.884
And we would fight.

01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:49.447
Maybe drink too much.

01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:52.561
Real romantic.

01:27:56.520 --> 01:27:59.364
And then we would die

01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:03.046
and be buried in
a meadow by the lake.

01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:08.485
And the world would
forget about us.

01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:15.085
But we would
always have each other.

01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:19.610
I remember.

01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:24.051
Those memories are yours, Jack.

01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:27.045
They're ours.

01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:30.281
They are you.

01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:33.771
Good morning.

01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:42.361
I wanted to spend
the rest of my life here.

01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:45.526
You still can.

01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:51.443
I have to go.

01:29:51.920 --> 01:29:54.366
Those people need my help.

01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:03.282
We'll come back when it's over.

01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:06.446
Promise me.

01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:10.682
We'll come back when it's over.

01:30:47.520 --> 01:30:49.887
You had me worried
for a second.

01:30:51.160 --> 01:30:53.322
I thought you
weren't coming back.

01:30:56.200 --> 01:30:58.043
Well, I had to prove him wrong.

01:31:01.320 --> 01:31:02.560
You look like shit.

01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:07.044
You should see the other guy.

01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:08.964
If I had told you what
you'd find out there,

01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:11.009
you would have
thought I was crazy.

01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:14.003
I still do.

01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:16.887
Malcolm Beech.

01:31:17.200 --> 01:31:18.406
Julia Harper.

01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:28.006
Come on.

01:31:34.360 --> 01:31:35.559
<i>Mission,
I'm picking up a bio-trail</i>

01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:36.879
<i>somewhere near
the West Canyons.</i>

01:31:36.880 --> 01:31:38.723
<i>Can you confirm the sequence?</i>

01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:40.370
<i>Stand by.</i>

01:31:41.520 --> 01:31:43.761
<i>DNA confirmed, it's Jack.</i>

01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:47.883
<i>Mission,
185 just went off-grid.</i>

01:31:48.040 --> 01:31:50.327
<i>Copy, Tower.
We're seeing the same thing.</i>

01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:04.725
I'd been in the army less than a
year when that unholy Tet arrived.

01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:08.208
I saw the moon get taken out.

01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:10.647
Right up there
in the night sky.

01:32:12.600 --> 01:32:13.761
I couldn't believe it.

01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:18.205
After that, nature took over.

01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:20.850
There's bedrock around Chicago,

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:25.289
so we were spared the worst
of the waves and the quakes.

01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:28.969
Most people just starved.

01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:33.684
Then the Tet sent
troop ships down.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:35.809
The doors opened,

01:32:36.960 --> 01:32:39.088
and out you came.

01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:42.960
Astronaut Jack Harper.

01:32:44.400 --> 01:32:46.607
Thousands of you.

01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:50.291
Memory wiped.

01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:53.765
Programmed to kill.

01:32:55.680 --> 01:32:58.206
They had taken one of our best

01:32:58.920 --> 01:33:01.002
and turned him against us.

01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:05.925
No soul.

01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:09.850
No humanity.

01:33:13.640 --> 01:33:15.165
The Tet.

01:33:16.520 --> 01:33:18.727
What a brilliant machine.

01:33:19.560 --> 01:33:23.406
Feeding off one planet
after another for energy.

01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:28.204
Phase Two was drones.

01:33:28.480 --> 01:33:30.323
Repairmen.

01:33:30.840 --> 01:33:36.643
50 years of watching those hydro
rigs suck our planet dry.

01:33:39.240 --> 01:33:40.924
Then one day,

01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:45.122
I saw you set down.

01:33:46.280 --> 01:33:48.169
Another drone to fix.

01:33:49.680 --> 01:33:53.162
But in the rubble
that day was a book.

01:33:54.840 --> 01:33:56.968
You picked it up.

01:33:57.120 --> 01:33:59.407
You studied it.

01:34:00.840 --> 01:34:04.526
And I thought I saw a way.

01:34:06.680 --> 01:34:09.889
When you stepped in front of
that drone and saved her,

01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:12.206
I knew.

01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:16.205
You were in there somewhere.

01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:20.682
I just had to find
a way to bring you back.

01:34:44.560 --> 01:34:46.130
Watch it, watch it.

01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:48.163
Eyes on it.
Steady.

01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:50.322
Give it some space.

01:34:50.920 --> 01:34:52.729
Come on, you're
making it nervous.

01:34:56.080 --> 01:34:58.606
That is one
pissed-off weapon.

01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:02.563
No, it's just a machine.

01:35:05.960 --> 01:35:07.962
<i>I'm the weapon.</i>

01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:24.882
I would love to be there to see

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.207
that thing's face
when this goes off.

01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:29.762
That would be
a one-way trip.

01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:33.402
Yeah, but it would be worth it.

01:35:51.880 --> 01:35:53.962
Welcome back, Commander.

01:36:34.360 --> 01:36:35.771
Open the doors!

01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:03.286
Shit!

01:37:03.400 --> 01:37:04.526
Spread out!

01:37:11.800 --> 01:37:13.529
Head down, keep your head down!

01:37:44.920 --> 01:37:45.921
Jack!

01:37:46.880 --> 01:37:48.245
Follow me!

01:38:46.680 --> 01:38:49.126
Come on, you son of a bitch!

01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:51.641
Hey!

01:40:52.160 --> 01:40:53.286
Jack.

01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:01.489
I'm okay.

01:41:21.960 --> 01:41:23.325
The drone.

01:41:23.840 --> 01:41:25.649
Send the drone.

01:41:29.960 --> 01:41:31.689
It's gone.

01:41:33.800 --> 01:41:35.962
I thought we had it.

01:41:37.120 --> 01:41:38.724
I really did.

01:41:40.480 --> 01:41:42.687
I can take the bomb myself.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:44.161
Ah...

01:41:45.160 --> 01:41:47.640
You know it will
swat you like a fly.

01:41:48.160 --> 01:41:49.571
Not if I go.

01:41:52.560 --> 01:41:53.800
No.

01:41:55.200 --> 01:41:57.521
She asked you to bring me up.

01:41:59.160 --> 01:42:00.525
So bring me up.

01:42:03.720 --> 01:42:06.371
We'll go together.

01:42:21.560 --> 01:42:24.040
It reminds me of home.

01:42:34.200 --> 01:42:35.690
Ready?

01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:15.285
Jack.

01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:21.369
Dream of us.

01:43:36.360 --> 01:43:37.725
Jack...

01:44:25.960 --> 01:44:29.328
<i>Flight recorder
playback for the Odyssey mission.</i>

01:44:29.480 --> 01:44:31.960
<i>3 May, 2017.</i>

01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:33.764
Okay, Bob.

01:44:34.640 --> 01:44:36.449
Ready for space?

01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:51.047
<i>Good morning, Odyssey, from
your friends here at Mission Control.</i>

01:44:51.200 --> 01:44:53.280
<i>Good morning, Mission.
This is Commander Jack Harper.</i>

01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:55.681
<i>Thank you for that
fantastic wake-up call.</i>

01:44:55.840 --> 01:44:57.126
<i>Pre-rendezvous
checks complete.</i>

01:44:57.280 --> 01:45:00.682
<i>Electrical guidance
and nav systems, all good.</i>

01:45:00.840 --> 01:45:04.049
Range behind object,
250 clicks...

01:45:04.200 --> 01:45:08.000
12 below V-bar, closure rate
200 kilometers per hour.

01:45:08.160 --> 01:45:11.004
<i>Copy that.
It's good to see you, Jack.</i>

01:45:11.200 --> 01:45:14.204
<i>After 39 days of sleep, sounds
like you're ready to go.</i>

01:45:14.880 --> 01:45:16.564
I'm ready to go.

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:18.570
<i>Your next burn will
bring you up level</i>

01:45:18.720 --> 01:45:21.883
<i>and co-speed at 50 kilometer
range, where you'll hold.</i>

01:45:22.520 --> 01:45:24.682
Copy. We'll hold
50 clicks from object

01:45:24.800 --> 01:45:27.007
for sensor scan and evaluation.

01:45:27.400 --> 01:45:28.890
Targets look good.

01:45:29.040 --> 01:45:32.362
Initiating burn in 3,2,1...

01:45:32.520 --> 01:45:33.567
Ignition.

01:45:37.560 --> 01:45:38.721
<i>We see a good burn.</i>

01:45:38.880 --> 01:45:41.406
<i>Are you reading any
output from the object?</i>

01:45:41.600 --> 01:45:42.601
Negative.

01:45:42.760 --> 01:45:44.683
Zero heat.
No EMR.

01:45:45.400 --> 01:45:46.731
There's no sign of life.

01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:48.769
<i>How is the rest
of the crew doing?</i>

01:45:48.920 --> 01:45:51.241
Co-pilot Victoria Olsen
should be up here shortly.

01:45:51.400 --> 01:45:54.722
The rest of the crew
remains in delta sleep.

01:45:55.160 --> 01:45:56.279
<i>Copy that.</i>

01:45:56.280 --> 01:45:58.601
<i>You missed a hell
of a game last night.</i>

01:45:58.760 --> 01:46:01.684
What did I tell you guys? No
spoilers about last night's game.

01:46:01.840 --> 01:46:04.241
I'm looking forward to
watching it when I get back.

01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:06.400
You're not talking about
football already, are you?

01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:07.721
<i>Good morning, Vika.</i>

01:46:07.920 --> 01:46:09.120
<i>Good morning, Sally.</i>

01:46:09.240 --> 01:46:11.049
<i>How are you doing
this lovely morning?</i>

01:46:11.200 --> 01:46:13.771
Another day in paradise.

01:46:14.400 --> 01:46:15.401
Hey.

01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:21.401
One for history.

01:46:21.520 --> 01:46:22.521
Yeah.

01:46:35.760 --> 01:46:38.969
<i>Tech-49,
I have you on approach.</i>

01:46:39.560 --> 01:46:41.085
Hello, Sally.

01:46:42.440 --> 01:46:44.602
It's a busy morning, huh?

01:46:44.760 --> 01:46:48.003
<i>I'm picking up
a second passenger, Jack.</i>

01:46:51.400 --> 01:46:53.926
It's Julia Rusakova,

01:46:54.440 --> 01:46:57.125
the female survivor
from the crashed module.

01:46:57.800 --> 01:46:59.962
<i>State your intention.</i>

01:47:00.760 --> 01:47:04.287
Deliver the survivor,
as requested.

01:47:04.800 --> 01:47:06.484
We are

01:47:08.480 --> 01:47:10.801
a more effective team.

01:47:11.920 --> 01:47:13.649
<i>Proceed to entry.</i>

01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:21.486
<i>Mission, we have a situation.</i>

01:47:21.640 --> 01:47:25.645
<i>The last burn was spot-on to give
us a 50-click hold from object,</i>

01:47:26.160 --> 01:47:28.322
but radar range
still decreasing.

01:47:28.480 --> 01:47:31.290
We're accelerating
toward the object.

01:47:31.440 --> 01:47:33.010
We're going to need
full OMS burn to pull away.

01:47:33.160 --> 01:47:34.810
Initiate now.
Entering target.

01:47:37.160 --> 01:47:38.571
Gimbals set.
Target's good.

01:47:38.760 --> 01:47:40.683
Arm forward engines.
Engines on.

01:47:40.840 --> 01:47:42.842
Ready? Let's go.

01:47:52.360 --> 01:47:55.364
Mission, we're in full OMS
burn, trying to back out.

01:47:55.520 --> 01:47:57.159
There's a lot of vibration.

01:47:58.320 --> 01:47:59.919
We're not getting
away from this thing.

01:47:59.920 --> 01:48:02.526
<i>Odyssey, telemetry shows
structural overstress.</i>

01:48:02.680 --> 01:48:05.047
<i>Knock off the burn.
Do you copy?</i>

01:48:05.320 --> 01:48:06.367
Cutting off burn.

01:48:08.840 --> 01:48:10.524
Mission.

01:48:11.200 --> 01:48:12.645
Mission?
Mission?

01:48:12.840 --> 01:48:14.046
Sally?

01:48:15.160 --> 01:48:17.049
Increased acceleration
toward the object.

01:48:17.200 --> 01:48:19.282
Estimated contact
within two minutes.

01:48:24.840 --> 01:48:26.808
I'm going to eject
the sleep module.

01:48:27.520 --> 01:48:29.488
It's programmed for
reinsertion into Earth orbit.

01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:32.564
I'll fly the Command module
out if I break free.

01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:34.529
I want you back there now.
Absolutely not.

01:48:34.680 --> 01:48:35.761
That's an order!

01:48:35.880 --> 01:48:37.041
Jack, no, we're a team.

01:48:59.720 --> 01:49:02.405
We've got to go,
Jack! 30 seconds!

01:49:05.160 --> 01:49:07.731
Dream of us.

01:49:48.360 --> 01:49:49.361
Jack...

01:50:05.600 --> 01:50:08.888
<i>Tech-49,
enter at headway speed.</i>

01:50:09.920 --> 01:50:12.287
Entering at headway.

01:50:28.440 --> 01:50:29.646
You buck up, Bob.

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.321
Don't go all shaky on me.

01:51:07.360 --> 01:51:09.124
<i>Jack, I can't help notice</i>

01:51:09.280 --> 01:51:13.001
<i>your respiration
and heart rate have increased.</i>

01:51:13.840 --> 01:51:16.320
I'm just excited to
finally meet you, Sally.

01:51:16.520 --> 01:51:21.526
<i>There's been a pattern of
insubordinate behavior recently.</i>

01:51:22.800 --> 01:51:24.086
Yeah.

01:51:24.600 --> 01:51:26.523
I feel bad about that.

01:51:27.720 --> 01:51:31.520
<i>Voice analysis indicates
you are lying to me, Jack.</i>

01:51:31.680 --> 01:51:33.489
<i>Tell me why you are here.</i>

01:51:33.640 --> 01:51:35.290
<i>You have five seconds.</i>

01:51:42.480 --> 01:51:44.562
I want Julia to live.

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.685
I want our species to survive.

01:51:50.720 --> 01:51:52.688
This is the only way.

01:51:58.360 --> 01:52:02.206
<i>Proceed to landing.
Atmosphere provided.</i>

01:53:00.360 --> 01:53:03.523
<i>Welcome home, Jack.</i>

01:53:16.480 --> 01:53:17.481
Come on.

01:53:17.680 --> 01:53:20.524
<i>Jack,
you're doing the right thing.</i>

01:53:20.920 --> 01:53:24.402
I don't know what you
are, or where you're from,

01:53:26.240 --> 01:53:29.289
but I'd like to tell you
about something I read.

01:53:30.240 --> 01:53:33.369
A story from Rome,

01:53:34.360 --> 01:53:36.840
a city you destroyed.

01:53:37.680 --> 01:53:39.364
It's a classic.

01:53:40.240 --> 01:53:43.369
There was a guy, Horatius,

01:53:44.240 --> 01:53:47.369
held the bridge alone
against a whole army.

01:53:47.520 --> 01:53:50.000
And what Horatius said was,

01:53:50.160 --> 01:53:52.208
"How can a man die better..."

01:53:52.360 --> 01:53:56.968
<i>You don't have to die, Jack.
She doesn't have to die.</i>

01:53:57.120 --> 01:53:59.521
Everybody dies, Sally.

01:53:59.680 --> 01:54:01.364
The thing is, to die well.

01:54:10.400 --> 01:54:14.883
<i>Jack, that's not
the survivor you promised me.</i>

01:54:15.640 --> 01:54:17.642
No, it's not.

01:54:40.160 --> 01:54:43.881
What Horatius said was,

01:54:44.040 --> 01:54:47.044
"How can a man die better"

01:54:49.040 --> 01:54:52.567
<i>"Than facing fearful odds"</i>

01:54:52.960 --> 01:54:56.328
Drones!
Get inside! Get inside!

01:54:56.480 --> 01:54:58.164
<i>"For the ashes of his fathers"</i>

01:55:01.200 --> 01:55:03.771
<i>"And the temples of his Gods"</i>

01:55:05.320 --> 01:55:07.448
<i>I created you, Jack.</i>

01:55:07.600 --> 01:55:09.682
<i>I am your God.</i>

01:55:22.080 --> 01:55:23.764
Fuck you, Sally.

01:56:16.520 --> 01:56:20.161
<i>Earth, after the war.</i>

01:56:20.800 --> 01:56:24.282
<i>Three years have passed
since I saw your face.</i>

01:56:25.880 --> 01:56:29.566
<i>I wonder if I come to
you at night, in dreams.</i>

01:56:30.440 --> 01:56:33.967
<i>In the day, as memories.</i>

01:56:35.200 --> 01:56:38.966
<i>Do I haunt your hours
the way you haunted mine?</i>

01:56:41.480 --> 01:56:42.925
<i>And I wonder if you see me</i>

01:56:43.600 --> 01:56:45.250
<i>when you look at her.</i>

01:56:57.400 --> 01:56:59.323
Mommy, look.

01:57:04.560 --> 01:57:09.168
<i>If we have souls, they are
made of the love we share.</i>

01:57:12.640 --> 01:57:15.007
<i>Undimmed by time.</i>

01:57:16.080 --> 01:57:18.401
<i>Unbound by death.</i>

01:57:36.080 --> 01:57:39.641
<i>For three years, I searched
for the house he built.</i>

01:57:41.520 --> 01:57:42.931
<i>I knew it had to be out there.</i>

01:57:46.760 --> 01:57:49.161
<i>Because I know him.</i>

01:57:56.920 --> 01:57:58.922
<i>I am him.</i>

01:58:01.160 --> 01:58:02.321
Who's that?

01:58:10.640 --> 01:58:13.086
<i>I am Jack Harper.</i>

01:58:14.520 --> 01:58:17.171
<i>And I am home.</i>
