THUNDER RUMBLES

00:54.523 --> 00:56.403
Blast.

00:57.463 --> 00:59.523
Godfrey!

01:08.583 --> 01:10.683
Godfrey!

01:10.683 --> 01:14.323
Very sorry, sir.
The power seems to be out.

01:14.323 --> 01:16.643
Yes, that's evident. Dreadful night.

01:16.643 --> 01:19.383
Indeed. That will be all, Godfrey.

01:19.383 --> 01:20.803
Of course, sir.

01:31.223 --> 01:33.003
Damn it!

01:40.463 --> 01:43.023
It can't be. Timothy?

01:43.023 --> 01:45.023
Oh, dear God.
Please don't, I'm sorry.

01:45.023 --> 01:48.843
I'm so very sorry, Timothy. Timothy!

01:56.963 --> 01:59.123
DOOR OPENS

02:13.963 --> 02:19.483
William! Hello. I came to
see that you were all right.

02:19.483 --> 02:22.843
The electricity is out everywhere.
It's only darkness, William.

02:22.843 --> 02:24.883
It's quite lovely, actually.

02:24.883 --> 02:28.183
I never get to see the
city like this any more.

02:28.183 --> 02:30.143
How was your day?

02:30.143 --> 02:32.503
Fine.

02:32.503 --> 02:33.883
And?

02:33.883 --> 02:36.923
It was fine. And yours?

02:37.983 --> 02:39.923
Also fine.

02:49.783 --> 02:52.823
Sir. Doctor.

02:52.823 --> 02:55.983
A rotten old night out there.
The rain's got the sewer blocked up,

02:55.983 --> 02:59.263
there's rats as big as
pumpkins roaming the street.

02:59.263 --> 03:05.163
What brings you here, George?
Sir, there's been a suspicious
death at Beaton Manor.

03:14.763 --> 03:19.663
Well, Chauncey Beaton's neck was
broken. In two places, it feels like.

03:19.663 --> 03:24.463
It appears he fell from that window.
Oh, that would do it.

03:24.463 --> 03:29.163
Was it accidental then?
Or was it suicide? Or was he pushed?

03:29.163 --> 03:31.163
I'll tell you what killed him.
It was this house.

03:31.163 --> 03:34.003
What do you mean, ma'am? Claire.

03:34.003 --> 03:36.983
I'll say it aloud,
what we've all said in whispers.

03:36.983 --> 03:40.183
That house is cursed.
That house killed Master Chauncey.

03:45.023 --> 03:48.363
What do you mean the house killed
him, ma'am? I mean it as I say it.

03:48.363 --> 03:52.323
It is cursed by voodoo. Bad magic.
Very bad. That's enough, Claire.

03:52.323 --> 03:53.843
Please go inside!

03:55.923 --> 03:59.643
You have to excuse her,
she's very superstitious.

03:59.643 --> 04:02.303
And you are? William Godfrey.

04:02.303 --> 04:04.503
The butler. I found the body.

04:04.503 --> 04:06.963
Mr Godfrey put the
call in to us, sir.

04:06.963 --> 04:10.323
Ah, yes. You mentioned you thought
the death was suspicious.

04:10.323 --> 04:14.003
What did you mean? I don't know.
I thought I saw something.

04:14.003 --> 04:16.942
It may have been a trick of the mind.
What did you see?

04:16.942 --> 04:22.703
As I was standing above
Mr Chauncey's body, I thought I
saw someone standing in that window.

04:25.723 --> 04:29.083
My Lord, Sir.
He's still there. George.

04:35.723 --> 04:39.523
Detective Murdoch, Toronto
Constabulary. Identify yourself.

04:39.523 --> 04:41.523
Ronald Beaton.

04:41.523 --> 04:44.343
Brother of the deceased.

04:44.343 --> 04:46.043
I take it he is...

04:47.103 --> 04:48.923
..deceased?

04:48.923 --> 04:51.523
I'm sorry for your loss, Mr Beaton.

04:51.523 --> 04:54.423
Where were you at the
time of the incident?

04:54.423 --> 04:56.503
Strange question.

04:56.503 --> 04:58.563
I had assumed
Chauncey killed himself.

04:58.563 --> 05:00.323
Why assume that?

05:00.323 --> 05:02.423
Suicide runs in the family.

05:02.423 --> 05:05.143
Please, sir. Your whereabouts?

05:05.143 --> 05:08.283
I was asleep. In my room.

05:08.283 --> 05:10.483
Can anyone vouch for this?

05:10.483 --> 05:14.103
I didn't push my brother
out of a window, detective.

05:14.103 --> 05:17.943
The exertion would have
killed me first. How so?

05:17.943 --> 05:19.883
I have a bad heart.

05:19.883 --> 05:24.183
Two attacks already. The doctors
say the next will be my last.

05:24.183 --> 05:26.843
What do the...

05:26.843 --> 05:28.703
staff say it was?

05:28.703 --> 05:30.603
They believe the house is cursed.

05:33.303 --> 05:35.363
It's not the house.

05:35.363 --> 05:37.843
This whole family is cursed.

05:38.223 --> 05:42.083
Sir. We've had reports of...
Look at that!

05:42.083 --> 05:47.103
Several witnesses report
hearing shouting just before
the victim fell, sir. Ah.

05:47.103 --> 05:50.443
That must have been what awakened me.

05:50.443 --> 05:55.063
George, gather all the staff and
residents in the drawing room.

05:55.063 --> 05:57.523
Sir.

06:04.203 --> 06:07.723
Who heard shouting in the moments
before Chauncey Beaton fell?

06:10.423 --> 06:13.303
And who was shouting?
Master Chauncey.

06:13.303 --> 06:16.383
What was he saying? He was
shouting master Timothy's name.

06:16.383 --> 06:18.243
That would be our half-brother.

06:18.243 --> 06:20.183
And where is he?

06:20.183 --> 06:22.563
In that jar on the mantel.

06:22.563 --> 06:24.123
His ashes.

06:24.123 --> 06:26.543
He killed himself last February.

06:26.543 --> 06:29.643
Ah, yes,
I believe that was in the papers.

06:29.643 --> 06:33.823
My condolences.
There are just two of us now.

06:33.823 --> 06:37.343
Yourself and...? Byron. My husband.

06:37.343 --> 06:40.523
He should be home shortly.

06:40.523 --> 06:45.903
Why would your brother Chauncey be
shouting your dead brother's name?

06:45.903 --> 06:48.643
Perhaps he felt guilty.
Guilty for what?

06:52.683 --> 06:54.263
Byron, it's awful.

06:54.263 --> 06:57.203
So it's true, then? Chauncey's dead?

06:57.203 --> 07:00.363
This is Detective Murdoch.

07:00.363 --> 07:05.943
A detective? I'm sorry to ask
at this time, sir, but where were
you this evening at 8 o'clock?

07:05.943 --> 07:07.903
On my way to meet
a business acquaintance.

07:07.903 --> 07:09.583
They can confirm this?

07:09.583 --> 07:12.843
Actually, no. He never arrived.

07:12.843 --> 07:14.603
It's not surprising
on a night like...

07:14.603 --> 07:18.903
You're not suggesting that
I had anything to do...

07:18.903 --> 07:21.963
For God's sakes, man, it was
a suicide! Who told you that?

07:23.543 --> 07:25.403
I just assumed.

07:25.403 --> 07:28.263
It's the curse. Who said that?

07:28.263 --> 07:32.983
The next person to breathe that word
will be in a boat back to Haiti.
Is that understood?

07:32.983 --> 07:37.003
No more of this mumbo-jumbo
about voodoo and ghosts.

07:37.003 --> 07:43.123
If you'll excuse me,
I have to change out of these
damp clothes. A word, Mr Beaton.

07:43.123 --> 07:47.723
George, I want statements from
everyone here, please. Sir.

07:51.553 --> 07:53.693
My apologies for that
outburst, Detective.

07:55.033 --> 07:58.173
These people cling to
the same superstitions

07:58.173 --> 08:00.493
their ancestors brought from Africa.

08:04.173 --> 08:05.893
It's a bloody disgrace.

08:05.893 --> 08:09.293
Sir, would you assume that
your brother committed suicide?

08:10.893 --> 08:14.553
Chauncey was a troubled soul.

08:14.553 --> 08:18.853
Was his soul troubled by the
suicide of your brother, Timothy?

08:20.533 --> 08:25.733
Chauncey was heard yelling
Timothy's name shortly before
he fell to his death.

08:25.733 --> 08:27.393
Ah, yes.

08:27.393 --> 08:30.333
Chauncey never got over it.
None of us have.

08:30.333 --> 08:33.472
My poor wife, she found Timothy's
body in the pool, you know.

08:33.472 --> 08:35.852
We were all devastated.

08:35.852 --> 08:38.472
Did Chauncey feel guilt
over Timothy's death?

08:38.472 --> 08:41.053
I suppose we all did.

08:41.053 --> 08:46.173
Before Timothy did himself in,
he wrote letters to each of us,

08:46.173 --> 08:49.213
detailing the wrongs we'd
committed against him and his mother.

08:51.233 --> 08:54.273
Are these...? Death masks, yes.

08:54.273 --> 08:56.033
A Beaton tradition.

08:56.033 --> 08:58.273
Death becomes us, you might say.

08:58.273 --> 09:03.733
I see. And what of these wrongs
that Timothy wrote about?

09:03.733 --> 09:06.293
Did you ever meet Timothy? No.

09:12.013 --> 09:14.893
This was his final portrait.

09:14.893 --> 09:17.173
Yes, he was a mulatto.

09:17.173 --> 09:22.293
After our mother died, father took up
with a member of the household staff.

09:22.293 --> 09:26.273
And Timothy was the
product of that union?

09:26.273 --> 09:30.733
My brothers and I didn't take well
to having a brown bastard sharing
our name, as you might imagine.

09:30.733 --> 09:33.253
Why would I imagine that, sir?

09:34.313 --> 09:36.353
We treated him rather badly.

09:36.353 --> 09:38.773
His mother too, I'm afraid.
And where is she?

09:38.773 --> 09:41.613
Chante died last
year of pneumonia.

09:41.613 --> 09:43.613
Timothy blamed me for that.

09:43.613 --> 09:47.653
Apparently the doctor
I brought in was inadequate.

09:47.653 --> 09:49.693
And what wrongs had
Chauncey committed?

09:49.693 --> 09:51.733
They quarrelled the
night before he died.

09:53.313 --> 09:55.933
His last words to Timothy were harsh.

09:55.933 --> 09:58.413
I know
Chauncey felt terrible about it.

09:58.413 --> 10:00.413
Enough for Chauncey
to take his own life?

10:00.413 --> 10:03.333
Perhaps something about these walls

10:03.333 --> 10:05.433
drives men to madness.

10:07.353 --> 10:10.153
That's rubbish.
You're telling me that this Chauncey

10:10.153 --> 10:14.453
calls his brother Timothy a few
names, then feels so bad that
he throws himself out of a window?

10:14.453 --> 10:16.693
Sir, Timothy Beaton
did kill himself.

10:16.693 --> 10:18.593
Possibly as a result
of that quarrel.

10:18.593 --> 10:21.373
Perhaps it was too much for
Chauncey to bear. Six months later?

10:21.373 --> 10:24.493
I understand regrets, Murdoch -
I've had a few myself, but...

10:24.493 --> 10:26.813
I agree, it seems somewhat unlikely.

10:26.813 --> 10:30.853
But Chauncey was heard calling
Timothy's name as he fell.

10:30.853 --> 10:34.153
Perhaps he was announcing his
imminent arrival in the afterlife.

10:34.153 --> 10:38.813
I don't know, perhaps there is
something to this curse business.
Curse?

10:38.813 --> 10:41.013
Yes, Beaton Manor
is said to be cursed.

10:41.013 --> 10:43.073
Ah, well, that's it then.
Good work, Crabtree. A curse.

10:43.073 --> 10:45.633
Of course! Bloody hell.

10:45.633 --> 10:47.733
Clearly we need to know
more about this family.

10:47.733 --> 10:50.973
George, find out everything you can
about the Beatons. Right away, sir.

10:50.973 --> 10:54.493
And the curse as well. But that's
not to be your focus, George.

10:54.493 --> 10:58.293
Sir. You're just encouraging him,
you know.

10:58.293 --> 11:01.953
Superstition has been used
to cover up murder in the past.

11:01.953 --> 11:03.613
Perhaps someone is doing that now.

11:06.313 --> 11:12.413
Chauncey Beaton's skull was shattered
in the fall, and his neck was indeed
broken. He could have died on impact.

11:12.413 --> 11:16.253
Could have? It wasn't
necessarily the fall that killed him.

11:16.253 --> 11:19.653
In the seconds before, he
suffered a massive heart attack.

11:21.293 --> 11:26.113
But to fall out of a window, surely
a heart attack would have dropped
him right there on the floor.

11:26.113 --> 11:30.233
Yes, unlikely he'd think to step
onto a window ledge. Point taken.

11:30.233 --> 11:34.393
Any idea what could cause
a heart attack in a man
barely 30 years of age?

11:34.393 --> 11:38.113
A number of things really.
Birth defects, week arteries.

11:38.113 --> 11:42.273
Extreme shock. Like an attack
by an assailant intent on murder?

11:42.273 --> 11:45.173
Perhaps.

11:45.173 --> 11:49.053
Did you know them at all,
the Beatons? Not well.

11:49.053 --> 11:51.613
I met Timothy on a
number of social occasions.

11:51.613 --> 11:54.393
He was a sweet man.
A bit tormented, I sensed.

11:54.393 --> 11:58.773
You're aware he committed suicide?
Yes. Do you have any idea why?

11:58.773 --> 12:02.153
It was rumoured that the woman he
loved married one of his brothers.

12:02.153 --> 12:04.533
Byron, I believe.

12:05.593 --> 12:08.633
What have you learnt, George?
Quite a lot, actually, sir.

12:08.633 --> 12:11.873
Would you like to ask me
questions, or shall I regale you?

12:11.873 --> 12:14.013
I sense you are in a regaling mood.

12:14.013 --> 12:18.273
You would be correct. So, the
Beatons are not actually Beatons.

12:18.273 --> 12:20.193
Their original family
name was Beton. French?

12:20.193 --> 12:22.113
Then Haitian.

12:22.113 --> 12:26.133
They held large plantations
in what was then Saint Dominique.

12:26.133 --> 12:29.793
They fled during
the slave rebellion in 1791,
but couldn't go back to France

12:29.793 --> 12:33.773
because they were still lopping off
heads there, so they came to Canada.

12:33.773 --> 12:36.333
I understand they made the fortune
in rubber trees? That's right, sir.

12:36.333 --> 12:39.393
They purchased large holdings in the
Congo just before the rubber boom.

12:39.393 --> 12:43.173
Not so cursed after all.
Sir, I believe they are cursed.

12:43.173 --> 12:47.693
Over the last century,
only a single Beaton man has ever
survived past the age of 50.

12:47.693 --> 12:50.233
Really? How did they die?

12:50.233 --> 12:54.753
Seven sudden deaths, probably
heart attacks, five suicides

12:54.753 --> 12:57.593
and three accidental deaths,
two of which involved a horse.

12:57.593 --> 13:00.333
Or horses. If that's not
cursed, I don't know what is.

13:00.333 --> 13:04.573
I suspect this curse is nothing
more than bad luck coupled with

13:04.573 --> 13:08.353
the melancholy of having too much
money and too little purpose.

13:08.353 --> 13:09.933
Who was the one lucky survivor?

13:09.933 --> 13:12.773
Henry Beaton, the father
of the four brothers.

13:12.773 --> 13:16.533
He died at the age of 60,
three years ago, from a...

13:16.533 --> 13:19.033
Heart attack? Most likely, sir.

13:20.633 --> 13:24.193
Does it strike you as odd that the
brothers all lived at Beaton Manor?

13:24.193 --> 13:26.393
Odd indeed, sir. Peculiar, even.

13:31.013 --> 13:33.473
What have we here?

13:33.473 --> 13:35.293
I would have spoken
to you last night.

13:35.293 --> 13:38.713
I meant to, but after Master
Byron's outburst I felt that...

13:38.713 --> 13:41.273
Say what you came to say,
Mr Godfrey.

13:41.273 --> 13:46.853
Well, how does one say such a
thing without being judged insane?

13:46.853 --> 13:49.433
I promise no such judgment.

13:51.633 --> 13:54.053
Over the last two weeks,

13:54.053 --> 13:58.293
my niece Claire and other members
of my staff have reported seeing

13:58.293 --> 14:02.313
an apparition wandering
through the halls of Beaton Manor.

14:02.313 --> 14:04.513
A ghost?

14:04.513 --> 14:08.493
I dismissed this, of course,
until last night.

14:08.493 --> 14:11.893
After you left, I saw him myself.

14:11.893 --> 14:18.053
It was the man
I'd seen in the tower window
just after Master Chauncey died.

14:18.053 --> 14:19.733
Did you recognise this man?

14:22.553 --> 14:27.353
As God is my witness,
Sir, it was Timothy Beaton.

14:31.673 --> 14:34.873
Who here believes they have seen
the ghost of Timothy Beaton?

14:36.773 --> 14:38.613
No-one?

14:38.613 --> 14:41.933
You can all rest assured that
no matter what you say here,

14:41.933 --> 14:45.453
your jobs are safe.
Isn't that right, Mr Beaton?

14:45.453 --> 14:48.173
Yes, of course. So I'll ask again.

14:48.173 --> 14:51.193
Who here has seen this ghost?

14:52.253 --> 14:54.433
Last week in the east wing.

14:54.433 --> 14:57.313
He had on the clothes he was wearing
when they pulled him from the pool.

14:57.313 --> 15:03.333
We've heard footsteps too.
But there's never anybody there.
This is absurd.

15:03.333 --> 15:07.093
Ghosts don't exist.
How do you know that, Byron?

15:07.093 --> 15:12.953
Don't souls arise from their bodies?
They don't linger, Ronald.
Maybe some do.

15:12.953 --> 15:15.033
The tormented souls.

15:15.033 --> 15:17.333
With unfinished business,

15:17.333 --> 15:19.873
like vengeance for wrongs done.
You've been drinking.

15:19.873 --> 15:23.173
With good reason. Did we not
deny Timothy his blood right?

15:23.173 --> 15:26.613
Did we not hound his mother
to an early grave?
Not in front of the staff!

15:26.613 --> 15:29.953
Did you not steal
the only woman he ever loved?
And drive him to take his own life?

15:29.953 --> 15:32.413
WOMAN CRIES

15:32.413 --> 15:34.593
How dare you! Gentleman.

15:36.213 --> 15:41.513
If I were Timothy, I'd find
my way back to us if I had to
pass through hell to do it.

15:41.513 --> 15:45.773
George, I want a record of every
sighting. Who, what, where and when.

15:45.773 --> 15:47.913
Sir.

16:03.213 --> 16:04.673
Mrs Beaton.

16:07.513 --> 16:08.933
Thank you.

16:11.193 --> 16:14.013
I understand you were
once courted by Timothy.

16:17.733 --> 16:19.773
Everything Ronald said is true.

16:21.493 --> 16:24.093
Timothy killed himself
because of me.

16:24.093 --> 16:27.353
You can't possibly know that. No?

16:27.353 --> 16:31.433
He wrote a letter the day
he died telling me as much.

16:33.933 --> 16:36.193
I searched for him.

16:36.193 --> 16:38.253
I was frantic.

16:39.873 --> 16:42.573
Yes, your husband
mentioned you found the body.

16:44.193 --> 16:47.393
Timothy was at the bottom
of the courtyard pool.

16:47.393 --> 16:51.873
He'd tied a sack of
rocks about his waist.

16:51.873 --> 16:55.853
He'd had to smash through the
eyes with a sledgehammer to do it.

16:55.853 --> 17:00.893
Mrs Beaton, if you don't mind, who
signed Timothy's death certificate?

17:02.653 --> 17:05.492
Dr Gladsford?
He's highly reputable, William.

17:05.492 --> 17:09.673
I was just wondering if he may
have been hasty in his conclusions.

17:09.673 --> 17:12.393
You think Timothy Beaton's
still alive?

17:12.393 --> 17:14.133
I'm asking if it's possible.

17:14.133 --> 17:16.492
It would explain why
people keep seeing him.

17:16.492 --> 17:19.553
Unless he really is a ghost.

17:19.553 --> 17:21.153
Julia.

17:21.153 --> 17:23.413
William.

17:25.193 --> 17:27.512
I have Dr Gladsford's report here.

17:27.512 --> 17:29.493
If you wouldn't mind.

17:31.493 --> 17:33.653
Well, there were no vital signs.

17:33.653 --> 17:37.293
No heart beat or breathing.
His skin was cold to the touch.

17:37.293 --> 17:41.093
These observations were taken
a full hour after Timothy
was pulled from the water.

17:41.093 --> 17:43.233
I wouldn't call this hasty.

17:43.233 --> 17:45.273
So the report is unassailable?

17:45.273 --> 17:48.493
Given these facts, I would
have drawn the same conclusion.

17:48.493 --> 17:50.253
Timothy Beaton is dead, William.

17:50.253 --> 17:54.713
Whatever's stalking the halls
of the manor, it isn't him.

17:54.713 --> 17:57.473
So, you're from Haiti then? No.

17:57.473 --> 17:59.993
Master Timothy used to take us there.

17:59.993 --> 18:03.213
He said it was our
family's true home.

18:03.213 --> 18:07.553
Family?
So you and Timothy were related?

18:07.553 --> 18:09.993
He was my cousin's son, you know.

18:09.993 --> 18:12.133
Her name was Chante.

18:12.133 --> 18:14.653
Ma'am, forgive me for asking,

18:14.653 --> 18:20.853
but if the Beaton family
mistreated Timothy and your cousin,
why did you stay on?

18:20.853 --> 18:25.733
Well, despite everything,
they loved the manor house.

18:25.733 --> 18:27.533
It's where they belonged.

18:27.533 --> 18:29.753
It's where I belong.

18:29.753 --> 18:33.653
So someone's being impersonating
Timothy Beaton's ghost?

18:33.653 --> 18:37.373
There's no other explanation, sir.
Pardon me, sirs, but there is.

18:37.373 --> 18:39.553
Perhaps it's time to
consider the unthinkable.

18:39.553 --> 18:42.453
That Timothy Beaton's ghost
is wandering Beaton Manor.

18:42.453 --> 18:46.553
I know how that sounds, but what do
we really know about the afterlife?

18:46.553 --> 18:49.153
People say there's a heaven,
but nobody's ever seen it.

18:49.153 --> 18:51.193
People have seen ghosts.

18:51.193 --> 18:55.193
And not just at Beaton Manor.
My Aunt Primrose saw
the ghost of my uncle...

18:55.193 --> 18:59.853
Not your bloody aunts again.
This constabulary will not
go chasing after goblins!

18:59.853 --> 19:01.413
Not goblins, sir.

19:01.413 --> 19:04.413
Goblins are small gnomish
creatures that dwell deep within...

19:04.413 --> 19:07.413
Whatever our beliefs or disbeliefs,
something happened at Beaton Manor.

19:07.413 --> 19:09.913
Now, George, you've made a
list of the occurrences? Sir.

19:11.453 --> 19:14.713
Sightings in red, audible events,

19:14.713 --> 19:16.893
footsteps and what not,
marked in blue.

19:16.893 --> 19:20.513
Each numbered in chronological order
beginning with November 8th.

19:20.513 --> 19:23.493
This all started 10 days ago?
Yes. Always at night.

19:23.493 --> 19:25.513
Usually between midnight and 3am.

19:25.513 --> 19:28.253
Nine incidents? That's one per night.

19:28.253 --> 19:31.073
Right. We're going to be
spending a night at the manor.

19:31.073 --> 19:35.493
Sir. If there is a ghost,
I want it haunting my jail cell.

19:35.493 --> 19:36.953
Understand?

19:39.493 --> 19:42.173
You'll be fine, George.

19:42.173 --> 19:45.693
I appreciate that you're conducting
an investigation, Detective.

19:45.693 --> 19:47.593
But the hour is late.

19:47.593 --> 19:49.953
Both of the masters of
the house are asleep.

19:49.953 --> 19:53.533
It's not our intention to
disturb them. Very well, then.

19:53.533 --> 19:56.293
I'll be in the servants'
quarters if you require anything.

19:56.293 --> 19:57.913
Thank you. Goodnight.

20:01.793 --> 20:04.233
Right then, George, you
and Higgins take the east wing,

20:04.233 --> 20:07.573
the inspector and I
will take the west wing and
we'll reconvene here in the morning.

20:07.573 --> 20:10.753
Keep the chat down. We don't
want to scare the ghost away.

20:10.753 --> 20:13.293
Oh, sir, I suspect the
reverse is more likely.

20:13.293 --> 20:15.253
Just get to it, Crabtree.

20:16.833 --> 20:18.433
He's still watching us.

20:18.433 --> 20:21.093
Yes.

20:21.093 --> 20:23.053
It's quite unnerving.

20:23.748 --> 20:29.188
Six months after my Uncle Percy
died, my Aunt Primrose awake to find
him standing at the foot of the bed.

20:29.188 --> 20:30.748
Maybe she was still dreaming.

20:30.748 --> 20:34.908
I once awoke to find
a group of dwarfs staring
down at me, and I was terrified.

20:34.908 --> 20:37.468
I must admit I find them
a bit unnerving myself.

20:37.468 --> 20:42.548
Anyways, once I awoke fully,
I realised there was nothing
but piles of clothing.

20:42.548 --> 20:45.988
I appreciate your point, Higgins,
but my aunt wasn't dreaming.

20:45.988 --> 20:50.688
When Uncle Percy turned around,
she saw a slit down
the middle of his jacket.

20:50.688 --> 20:54.128
So?
So, it turns out my Uncle Percy had
put on a few pounds before he died.

20:54.128 --> 20:57.228
The undertaker had to cut
his jacket to fit him into it.

20:57.228 --> 20:59.128
The thing is,
my aunt didn't know that.

20:59.128 --> 21:02.268
Really?
 God's truth.

21:02.268 --> 21:04.088
That is spooky.

21:04.088 --> 21:07.468
If you want spooky, I've been
reading about this Haitian voodoo.

21:07.468 --> 21:10.608
They have creatures called zombies.
They're the living dead.

21:10.608 --> 21:13.668
How can they be alive and dead?

21:25.020 --> 21:26.820
What is it, sir?

21:26.820 --> 21:29.380
I hear footsteps.
DISTANT FOOTSTEPS

21:31.640 --> 21:33.700
Coming from up ahead.

21:39.140 --> 21:42.600
Whoever it was must have
gone into one of these rooms.

21:53.560 --> 21:55.920
Empty. The same.

21:55.920 --> 21:58.460
Bloody hell. Maybe there is a ghost.

21:58.460 --> 22:00.200
Sir, you don't really
believe that, do you?

22:00.200 --> 22:03.120
I grew up near the Yorkshire moors.
There's more ghosts than sheep.

22:03.120 --> 22:06.800
I don't believe in ghosts per se,
but who's to say what goes on?

22:06.800 --> 22:11.280
Oh, the George Crabtree philosophy.
Very funny, Murdoch.

22:11.280 --> 22:13.720
More footsteps, sir.

22:13.720 --> 22:16.140
Coming from behind us.

22:17.980 --> 22:19.640
Mr Godfrey.

22:19.640 --> 22:22.020
I'm going to bed shortly.

22:22.020 --> 22:26.540
Is there anything you require? No,
thank you, Mr Godfrey. Good night.

22:34.480 --> 22:36.700
Did you just shiver? Yes.

22:36.700 --> 22:40.520
They say that when you shiver
suddenly, it means a ghost just
passed through you.

22:40.520 --> 22:43.320
How do they know that?

22:43.320 --> 22:46.160
I don't know.

22:46.160 --> 22:48.820
Sounds speculative.

22:48.820 --> 22:50.280
Perhaps.

22:56.620 --> 22:58.860
DISTANT BANGING
What was that?

22:58.860 --> 23:01.900
It came from...

23:01.900 --> 23:04.820
This is the room
Chauncey Beaton fell from.

23:04.820 --> 23:06.420
Who's there?

23:06.420 --> 23:08.280
Show yourself!

23:08.280 --> 23:10.320
CAT SQUEALS

23:10.320 --> 23:12.740
It's just a cat, Crabtree.

23:12.740 --> 23:15.500
In Haiti,
black cats have a certain...

23:15.500 --> 23:19.440
dark magic about them.
Mojo, I believe it's called. Mojo.

23:19.440 --> 23:22.020
I don't like the sound of that.

23:22.020 --> 23:25.860
It's nothing. They have these
dolls that you stick pins into.
CREAKING

23:27.120 --> 23:30.220
What's with these windows?

23:34.140 --> 23:36.420
That's him! That's the ghost.

23:39.900 --> 23:41.900
There he goes.

23:44.700 --> 23:46.440
Where did he go?

23:48.020 --> 23:49.900
Higgins, fetched Detective Murdoch.

23:51.900 --> 23:53.460
By myself, George?

23:53.460 --> 23:54.920
Just go.

24:01.100 --> 24:03.720
This ghost impersonator escaped
out the window, right, Murdoch?

24:03.720 --> 24:06.220
Sir, it's three storeys
straight down.

24:06.220 --> 24:08.240
A man doesn't simply
disappear, George.

24:08.240 --> 24:10.780
Yes, but if it's not a man...

24:10.780 --> 24:13.820
Perhaps he went into his death mask.

24:13.820 --> 24:17.380
Perhaps you're right, Higgins,
perhaps this is where
his soul resides.

24:17.380 --> 24:19.960
YELLING
Bloody hell, it's back there.

24:19.960 --> 24:22.180
You two stay here. Keep an eye open.

24:28.980 --> 24:31.180
Well?

24:31.180 --> 24:33.360
He's dead, sir.

24:33.360 --> 24:37.180
Murdoch. What in God's name
is going on in this house?

24:42.480 --> 24:44.880
How did this happen?
Right under our very noses?

24:44.880 --> 24:47.020
Sir, we don't know what happened.

24:47.020 --> 24:49.680
For all we know, Ronald
Beaton died of natural causes.

24:49.680 --> 24:51.420
You don't believe that, do you?

24:51.420 --> 24:53.560
I can't say that I do, sir.

24:53.560 --> 24:55.300
Right, theories. Facts, sir.

24:55.300 --> 24:58.280
Three of the four Beaton brothers
have died in the last six months,

24:58.280 --> 25:00.760
two within the last three days.
All heirs to a fortune.

25:00.760 --> 25:02.780
With just one brother left standing.

25:02.780 --> 25:04.320
Let's get Byron Beaton in.

25:04.320 --> 25:05.800
Yes, sir.

25:07.960 --> 25:09.880
Who's that, sir?

25:09.880 --> 25:12.380
The Beaton family lawyer.
I thought I'd have a chat.

25:12.380 --> 25:14.040
Very good.

25:14.040 --> 25:16.500
It's an unusual will,

25:16.500 --> 25:19.080
in that the estate in its entirety

25:19.080 --> 25:23.440
was passed on to all four sons
in the form of a joint tenancy.

25:23.440 --> 25:27.340
What's that? Well, Inspector,

25:27.340 --> 25:30.900
it's a form of estate
common to married couples.

25:30.900 --> 25:34.580
Upon the death of one, it
automatically passes to the other.

25:34.580 --> 25:37.400
Except in this case it passes
to the surviving brothers.

25:37.400 --> 25:39.340
Very good.

25:39.340 --> 25:42.840
Why would old man Beaton
do it like that? Two reasons.

25:42.840 --> 25:44.580
One is Beaton Manor itself.

25:44.580 --> 25:50.660
The house and the property alone
are worth close to $60,000, and that
is not counting the furnishings.

25:50.660 --> 25:54.180
Right. You can't divide up
a property like that.

25:54.180 --> 25:59.620
Well, you could if you sold it,
but then it would no longer be
Beaton Manor, would it, Inspector?

25:59.620 --> 26:04.360
I suppose not, Mr Ailmer.
What is the second reason?

26:04.360 --> 26:08.680
There was a concern expressed
by one of the siblings

26:08.680 --> 26:12.420
that the youngest son,
the um...mulatto...

26:12.420 --> 26:16.200
Timothy. That Timothy
intended to bequeath

26:16.200 --> 26:18.960
his portion
to the household servants,

26:18.960 --> 26:22.520
which might be fine
if he were the last to survive.

26:22.520 --> 26:27.640
But I trust you can see
the implications if he wasn't.
I'll do my best.

26:27.640 --> 26:30.620
Which brother expressed this concern?

26:30.620 --> 26:33.220
The eldest, Byron.

26:33.220 --> 26:37.000
You're aware you stand to
inherit the entire Beaton fortune.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.900
Of course I'm aware.
I'm not an idiot.

26:38.900 --> 26:42.660
Wasn't it at your urging
that the estate be bequeathed
as a joint tenancy?

26:42.660 --> 26:46.180
That was to prevent Timothy from
making a mockery of the Beaton name.

26:46.180 --> 26:50.140
He despised us. Even his suicide
was an act of hatred.

26:50.140 --> 26:53.200
I'm not convinced it was a suicide.

26:53.200 --> 26:54.800
I beg your pardon?

26:54.800 --> 26:56.680
Anyone could have tied
the weights around his waist,

26:56.680 --> 26:58.520
broken through the ice.

26:58.520 --> 27:00.440
For all I know he was dead already.

27:01.500 --> 27:04.460
You're suggesting I killed Timothy.

27:04.460 --> 27:07.580
No, I'm suggesting you killed
all three of your brothers.

27:07.580 --> 27:10.040
One by one.

27:10.040 --> 27:12.940
I'm sorry.

27:12.940 --> 27:16.520
This line of questioning
is too offensive to continue.

27:16.520 --> 27:18.760
You have no alibi
for Chauncey's murder.

27:18.760 --> 27:20.600
What about Ronald's death?

27:20.600 --> 27:23.060
I was sleeping in my bed.

27:23.060 --> 27:26.160
I assume your wife
can attest to this.

27:26.160 --> 27:28.100
No, I'm afraid I can't.

27:28.100 --> 27:31.240
Last night we
went to sleep together, but...

27:32.900 --> 27:37.200
He snores. I asked him to sleep
in the guest room next to ours.

27:37.200 --> 27:40.600
But I can assure you, he was
in that room when Ronald died.

27:40.600 --> 27:43.180
How can you be certain?

27:43.180 --> 27:47.900
When I awoke to Ronald's screams,
I went into the hall to investigate.

27:47.900 --> 27:49.680
Byron's door was still locked.

27:49.680 --> 27:51.580
He didn't come out
into the hall as well?

27:51.580 --> 27:53.480
He sleeps soundly.

27:53.480 --> 27:57.800
But he did emerge when Godfrey
pounded on the door to awaken him.

27:57.800 --> 28:00.880
You say you awoke to the
sound of Ronald screaming.

28:00.880 --> 28:02.820
That's right.

28:02.820 --> 28:08.300
From the time you heard the screams
to the time you exited into
the hall, how much time had elapsed?

28:09.880 --> 28:12.100
Two minutes. At the most.

28:12.100 --> 28:15.000
In two minutes, Byron would have
had to travel from where he was

28:15.000 --> 28:20.600
in the west wing all the way
to the room that he slept in on
the second floor. I've paced it out.

28:20.600 --> 28:23.240
How long did it take you?
Just under a minute.

28:23.240 --> 28:28.460
You could've covered
that distance in half the time.
What if he encountered someone?

28:28.460 --> 28:31.180
People heard Ronald scream.
They were coming out of their rooms.

28:31.180 --> 28:34.340
Yes, that is a problem.
But it is possible in theory.

28:34.340 --> 28:37.320
Sir, surely the ghost was
instrumental in Mr Beaton's death.

28:37.320 --> 28:40.700
It was, George. What?
But the ghost was Timothy.

28:40.700 --> 28:42.800
I saw it. It looked right at me.

28:42.800 --> 28:44.660
I believe the ghost was Byron.

28:44.660 --> 28:47.660
And I intend to demonstrate
how he did it.

29:33.400 --> 29:34.940
William.

29:34.940 --> 29:38.580
Come in, come in.
I see you've completed the mould.

29:38.580 --> 29:40.360
Latex rubber, you say?

29:40.360 --> 29:43.820
Yes. Recent additives have
made it pliable and strong.

29:43.820 --> 29:47.620
The process would have been familiar
to a rubber magnet like Byron.

29:47.620 --> 29:51.540
Speaking of, I have completed
the post mortem on young Ronald.

29:51.540 --> 29:53.500
Heart attack? Massive.

29:53.500 --> 29:55.420
Almost goes without saying.

29:57.940 --> 29:59.660
Very good, William.

30:02.700 --> 30:06.520
You'll need to shade
in the eyebrows and so forth.

30:06.520 --> 30:08.240
Colour the skin.

30:08.240 --> 30:12.260
Yes, I'll need to cut holes
for the eyes and nostrils.

30:12.260 --> 30:15.740
Wouldn't there be a gap between the
mask and the skin around the eyes?

30:15.740 --> 30:19.740
I believe that
Byron glued the mask to his face.

30:19.740 --> 30:22.660
Try it on. Oh, I...

30:23.740 --> 30:25.140
All right.

30:29.360 --> 30:31.860
William, you are a sport.

30:32.920 --> 30:37.980
By the way, there's a lecture tonight
on the Michaels and Morley
experiment. Seven o'clock.

30:37.980 --> 30:40.560
Ah, yes. I'd love to, but...

30:40.560 --> 30:42.620
Yes, I know, it's last minute.

30:42.620 --> 30:45.380
But I'll drop by anyway.
If you're free, we can go.

30:45.380 --> 30:48.400
Murdoch, I've been thinking...
Bloody hell.

30:48.400 --> 30:51.960
Good God, man. It's quite effective.

30:51.960 --> 30:54.480
Is this how Byron did it, then? Yes.

30:54.480 --> 30:57.520
The mask would need a few more
details, but I believe so, yes.

30:57.520 --> 30:59.880
All you have to do
now is find that mask.

30:59.880 --> 31:03.080
Is this absolutely necessary?

31:03.080 --> 31:05.020
I'm afraid it is, Mr Godfrey.

31:05.020 --> 31:07.600
Stop this! Stop this now!

31:07.600 --> 31:09.520
Not until we find what
we are looking for.

31:09.520 --> 31:11.460
By whose authority?

31:13.500 --> 31:15.440
We found nothing, sir.

31:15.440 --> 31:17.160
I'll have your badge, Murdoch.

31:17.160 --> 31:20.500
Ah, yes.
Just give me a moment, Mr Beaton.

31:22.460 --> 31:24.380
You've checked everywhere, George?

31:24.380 --> 31:27.120
Sir. Floor to ceiling, wall to wall.

31:27.120 --> 31:29.160
Then it must be behind the walls.

31:29.160 --> 31:31.720
Behind, sir? Think, George.

31:31.720 --> 31:35.440
This so-called ghost you followed,
he didn't simply disappear.

31:35.440 --> 31:39.080
He had to have some means
of escaping undetected.

31:39.080 --> 31:42.580
Isn't that right, Mr Beaton? I don't
know what you're talking about.

31:42.580 --> 31:46.960
There are secret passageways
throughout this house,
are there not? Fine.

31:46.960 --> 31:50.460
George, please, fetched a crowbar.
I won't have you destroy my house!

31:50.460 --> 31:53.480
Then tell me where the entrance
to the passageway is.

32:32.120 --> 32:35.340
George, fetch the lanterns, please.

32:41.680 --> 32:45.080
After you, Mr Godfrey. Sir?

32:45.080 --> 32:47.020
Go ahead.

32:50.020 --> 32:53.840
Do these passageways go
throughout the whole house? Yes.

32:53.840 --> 32:59.780
Emory Beaton and his family escaped
with their lives through secret
passageways built in the house

32:59.780 --> 33:02.180
during the slave rebellions
in San Dominique.

33:02.180 --> 33:06.500
Advantageous to have a ready escape
in the event your slaves
rise up against you.

33:06.500 --> 33:09.060
This must be where the foot falls
you heard last night came from.

33:09.060 --> 33:14.940
Yes, George. I believe we
heard Byron on his way to make his
ghostly appearance to you and Henry.

33:16.540 --> 33:18.660
I'm sure you're mistaken, sir.

33:21.160 --> 33:23.780
Careful here.
Some of these boards are loose.

33:29.660 --> 33:31.500
George.

33:49.200 --> 33:52.540
Sir, that must be the
mask the killer used.

33:52.540 --> 33:54.140
Yes, George.

33:54.140 --> 33:56.140
Arrest Byron Beaton.

34:03.316 --> 34:05.556
What are you thinking, sir?

34:07.616 --> 34:11.295
This is a quality piece of work,
very detailed.

34:11.295 --> 34:13.056
Even sewn the eyebrows.

34:13.056 --> 34:15.116
What have they used for the eyes,
stained glass?

34:15.116 --> 34:18.556
Easier to see through, I suppose.
Why not just cut out the eyeholes?

34:18.556 --> 34:22.396
He would have needed glue then
to hold the mask on.
Not enough time, I suppose.

34:22.396 --> 34:24.416
Well, congratulations, Murdoch.

34:24.416 --> 34:26.735
Another one solved.

34:26.735 --> 34:29.896
Perhaps. Perhaps?
Perhaps? What does that mean?

34:29.896 --> 34:33.396
Sir,
this mask could hang Byron Beaton.

34:33.396 --> 34:37.136
Why did he not just throw it in the
fire when he returned to his room?

34:37.136 --> 34:40.496
He couldn't have expected us to
find it in the secret passageway.

34:40.496 --> 34:43.636
But then why appear to you
and Higgins as Timothy's ghost?

34:43.636 --> 34:46.036
What was to be gained from that?
You're over-thinking this, Murdoch.

34:46.036 --> 34:47.775
No, sir, I don't believe I am.

34:47.775 --> 34:51.136
The killer wanted us to find
those passageways and the mask.

34:51.136 --> 34:54.896
Why? Because it explains the
appearance of Timothy's ghost

34:54.896 --> 34:58.556
and points the finger directly at
Byron as the killer. A frame up?

34:58.556 --> 35:00.496
Possibly.

35:00.496 --> 35:02.956
Then if it wasn't Byron,
who else could it have been?

35:02.956 --> 35:06.276
Who first introduced us
to the notion of a ghost?

35:06.276 --> 35:08.096
Godfrey.

35:08.096 --> 35:13.456
Yes, but he was disingenuous about
it - even dismissing his niece,
Claire, for being superstitious.

35:13.456 --> 35:15.656
But why? What did he
have against the brothers?

35:15.656 --> 35:18.536
Did you say Claire was his niece?
Yes.

35:18.536 --> 35:23.776
Claire told me she and Timothy's
mother, Chante, were cousins.

35:23.776 --> 35:25.396
They were?

35:25.396 --> 35:31.216
But if they were cousins,
and Claire is Godfrey's niece...

35:31.216 --> 35:35.316
You're mad!
Why would I impersonate a ghost?

35:35.316 --> 35:37.356
Vengeance, Mr Godfrey.

35:37.356 --> 35:41.996
Did you murder Chauncey Beaton? Did
you frighten Ronald Beaton to death?

35:41.996 --> 35:45.056
For what reason?! The Beatons
have always been good to me.

35:45.056 --> 35:47.136
But they treated Timothy badly.

35:47.136 --> 35:49.556
They treated his mother even worse.

35:49.556 --> 35:51.216
And what concern
would that be to me?

35:51.216 --> 35:54.056
Because your daughter
was Timothy's mother.

35:54.056 --> 35:57.316
Which means Timothy
was your grandson.

36:01.636 --> 36:03.136
Yes.

36:04.916 --> 36:07.156
But I swear to you,

36:07.156 --> 36:09.216
I wasn't the one wearing that mask.

36:09.216 --> 36:11.616
I didn't kill anyone. Mr Godfrey...

36:11.616 --> 36:14.336
I didn't kill anyone!

36:14.336 --> 36:18.256
We encountered Godfrey here, 1.14am.

36:18.256 --> 36:22.056
George and Henry found the ghost
here at 1.20am.

36:22.056 --> 36:27.236
Which gave him six minutes to change
into Timothy's clothes and scare the
bejesus out of Crabtree and Higgins.

36:27.236 --> 36:28.996
It's tight, Murdoch.

36:28.996 --> 36:31.136
And he's not a young man. No.

36:31.136 --> 36:32.776
Sirs? Yes, George?

36:32.776 --> 36:35.476
Bad news, I'm afraid. No less
than three maids swear they saw

36:35.476 --> 36:38.676
Godfrey come out of his room moments
after Ronald's screams were heard.

36:38.676 --> 36:40.936
Out of his room? You're sure? Sir.

36:40.936 --> 36:43.636
That's down in the
servant's quarters.

36:43.636 --> 36:46.516
A man can't be in two
places at once, Murdoch.

36:46.516 --> 36:48.576
So, what's your theory now?

36:53.916 --> 36:56.276
Murdoch? Murdoch!

36:56.276 --> 36:58.416
Sir.

36:58.416 --> 37:03.536
George, you said the ghost looked
directly at you. That's right.

37:03.536 --> 37:05.876
Gentlemen, I believe we have
to return to Beaton Manor.

37:12.956 --> 37:14.636
And this is exactly as you saw him?

37:14.636 --> 37:18.676
Um, yes... But?

37:18.676 --> 37:21.036
Well, it's hard to explain, sir.

37:21.036 --> 37:26.116
The ghost looked at me. And these
eyes stare straight ahead. Exactly.

37:26.116 --> 37:28.936
Now you're saying that the
killer never wore a mask?

37:28.936 --> 37:31.796
That's right, sir. Because he
couldn't look Crabtree in the eye?

37:31.796 --> 37:34.156
Sir, eye contact is unmistakable.

37:34.156 --> 37:38.096
It's powerful. One can always tell
when someone is looking at them.

37:38.096 --> 37:40.916
But only seeing eyes
are capable of this.

37:40.916 --> 37:43.776
The eyes of the mask are dead,
they don't connect.

37:45.376 --> 37:47.316
So, Timothy did it.

37:47.316 --> 37:50.516
Except that he's good and dead, so
it was either his ghost or his twin,

37:50.516 --> 37:52.436
which he didn't have,
so we're back to the ghost.

37:52.436 --> 37:55.656
Or perhaps it was his zombie.

37:55.656 --> 37:58.696
It wasn't his bloody zombie, either.
What is a zombie, anyway?

37:58.696 --> 38:02.996
Sir, it is a man who wakes from the
dead after a certain voodoo spell.

38:02.996 --> 38:07.256
And did he reconstitute himself
from his burnt ashes, as well?

38:07.256 --> 38:11.496
George, where did you
learn about these zombies?

38:11.496 --> 38:13.436
From my readings, sir.
But the maid, Claire,

38:13.436 --> 38:15.956
knows more about them than I do.

38:15.956 --> 38:17.776
Readings?

38:17.776 --> 38:20.036
I don't know much
about it, Mr Murdoch.

38:20.036 --> 38:22.536
I stay away from that kind of magic.

38:22.536 --> 38:24.576
Tell me what you do know,
Miss Claire.

38:26.176 --> 38:28.996
The bokor, he's a magic man.

38:28.996 --> 38:30.796
A sorcerer.

38:30.796 --> 38:34.836
He rubs some kind of magic powder
into you and it kills you dead.

38:34.836 --> 38:37.256
But you don't stay dead.

38:37.256 --> 38:42.356
When you wake up,
your soul is gone and it stays gone.

38:42.356 --> 38:44.716
That's all I know.

38:44.716 --> 38:48.196
It's a shame Master Timmy's dead,
he could have told you everything.

38:48.196 --> 38:52.816
He knew about this? Every time
we'd go to Haiti, he'd go to bokors
to learn their secrets.

38:52.816 --> 38:56.316
I think he wanted
to be a bokor himself,

38:56.316 --> 39:00.036
turn his brothers into zombies.

39:00.036 --> 39:02.116
A powder? What sort of powder?

39:02.116 --> 39:07.436
All I know is that when taken into
the body the poison induces
a death-like trance,

39:07.436 --> 39:09.476
from which the person
eventually awakens.

39:09.476 --> 39:13.216
And you think Timothy
could have taken this powder
to fake his own death?

39:13.216 --> 39:16.136
Yes. Do you think it's possible?

39:16.136 --> 39:18.556
William, I haven't
even had my morning tea.

39:18.556 --> 39:20.936
Yes, I'm aware of that, but...

39:20.936 --> 39:24.336
Well,
I suppose it's possible in theory.

39:24.336 --> 39:27.596
The poison of the puffer fish
can paralyse the diaphragm

39:27.596 --> 39:30.696
and slow the heart rate
to almost zero.

39:30.696 --> 39:32.676
The puffer fish is
from the Caribbean?

39:32.676 --> 39:34.316
I believe so.

39:34.316 --> 39:37.396
Could this poison have
constituted the bokor's powder?

39:38.976 --> 39:41.576
I suppose, it's possible.

39:41.576 --> 39:45.356
But you can't slow the body's heart
rate down without consequences.

39:45.356 --> 39:48.476
The brain requires
a constant flow of oxygen -

39:48.476 --> 39:50.396
or tea!

39:50.396 --> 39:55.956
The maid also said that
when these zombies awoke,
their souls were gone.

39:55.956 --> 40:00.276
Perhaps what they perceive as a lack
of a soul is actually brain damage.

40:00.276 --> 40:02.956
Could this be done without
suffering such damage?

40:02.956 --> 40:06.196
Well, you'd have to slow
the body's metabolic function.

40:06.196 --> 40:09.896
To do that you'd need to cool
the body to just above freezing.

40:09.896 --> 40:15.456
By plunging it into a
frozen pool in February.

40:15.456 --> 40:19.576
Puffer fish? There's a
fish that's actually called puffer?

40:19.576 --> 40:24.336
Yes, sir. The effects of the fish's
poison last approximately 12 hours,

40:24.336 --> 40:28.036
long enough to get a declaration
of death and to make a death mask.

40:28.036 --> 40:30.196
How did Timothy avoid being cremated?

40:30.196 --> 40:33.736
I suppose he snuck out of the casket
when he was sure no one was around.

40:33.736 --> 40:38.996
Would have been some trick to find a
stiff for the coffin before it went
up in smoke. Not for a man of means.

40:38.996 --> 40:40.896
Cadavers have been bought
and sold in the past.

40:40.896 --> 40:43.156
He couldn't have done
all this by himself. No.

40:43.156 --> 40:45.436
I believe he had an accomplice. Who?

40:45.436 --> 40:47.976
I've given this some thought, sir.

40:47.976 --> 40:52.496
Timothy may be alive,
but he can't very well
collect on his inheritance. No.

40:52.496 --> 40:55.216
It all goes to Byron at this point.
That's right.

40:55.216 --> 40:58.996
And if Byron is to hang, then who
would collect once he was dead?

40:58.996 --> 41:00.716
The wifey. That's right.

41:00.716 --> 41:02.996
The same woman who
discovered Timothy's body.

41:02.996 --> 41:06.336
The same woman who was once courted
by Timothy.

41:06.336 --> 41:08.856
Oh, that should be the last of it.

41:11.516 --> 41:13.476
Going on a trip, Mrs Beaton?

41:13.476 --> 41:15.316
Yes, Detective.

41:15.316 --> 41:17.876
I'm going to Montreal for...

41:17.876 --> 41:20.556
well, I don't know how long.

41:20.556 --> 41:24.416
I just know that if I stay in
this house another day, I'll go mad.

41:24.416 --> 41:27.376
Yes, I understand. Bad memories.

41:27.376 --> 41:30.996
My husband murdered
his own brothers.

41:30.996 --> 41:33.236
What could make him do such a thing?

41:35.956 --> 41:39.156
There must be some kind of evil
in these walls.

41:39.156 --> 41:42.516
Is this a permanent move, then?

41:42.516 --> 41:45.196
I don't know.
And what of the estate?

41:45.196 --> 41:47.196
Let the lawyers have it.

41:47.196 --> 41:49.836
I want nothing to do with it.

41:49.836 --> 41:54.816
As far as I'm concerned,
it is all cursed.

41:54.816 --> 41:56.356
Good day, Detective.

41:56.356 --> 41:58.076
Good day, Mrs Beaton.

41:59.656 --> 42:01.696
Sir, you're not just
going to let her leave?

42:01.696 --> 42:03.996
She's not leaving us, George,

42:03.996 --> 42:05.576
she's leading us.

42:26.196 --> 42:28.316
Won't be long, Tom.

42:30.636 --> 42:34.476
Hello.
Good day, sir. How can I help you?

42:34.476 --> 42:38.056
I'm looking for a Rowena Beaton.
I'm told she's staying here.

42:38.056 --> 42:41.836
Yes, but I didn't know
she was expecting visitors.

42:41.836 --> 42:42.796
Let me call for her.

42:44.196 --> 42:46.196
Rowena?

42:47.776 --> 42:50.396
A gentleman is here to see you.

42:50.396 --> 42:53.396
And your name, sir? Aldington Bird.

42:53.396 --> 42:55.076
Pleasure to meet you, Mr Bird.

42:55.076 --> 42:57.516
The same. And you are?

42:57.516 --> 42:59.356
Detective William Murdoch...

43:00.836 --> 43:03.956
..of the Toronto Constabulary.

43:08.856 --> 43:10.836
Damn you.

43:17.716 --> 43:19.816
It was all a sham, then?

43:19.816 --> 43:22.996
Every caress,
every sigh of affection.

43:22.996 --> 43:27.556
I'm afraid so. Rowena was a willing
pawn in your brother's revenge.

43:27.556 --> 43:34.096
Whatever compassion she had for
you was subverted by her desire to
be with Timothy. It was my fault.

43:34.096 --> 43:36.956
Would it have been so hard
to treat him with respect?

43:36.956 --> 43:38.996
It's something to contemplate.

43:38.996 --> 43:41.876
It actually felt triumphant
when I stole Rowena from him -

43:41.876 --> 43:44.476
or thought I had.

43:44.476 --> 43:46.996
Shameful. I've deserved this.

43:46.996 --> 43:50.156
Begging your pardon,
sir, no one deserved this.

43:50.156 --> 43:52.476
What would they have
done with the estate?

43:52.476 --> 43:54.636
I suppose sell off Beaton Manor.

43:54.636 --> 43:57.636
Hmm. Should probably sell it
myself, but who would want it?

43:57.636 --> 44:00.356
A cursed house of a cursed family.

44:00.356 --> 44:02.396
An all-too-human curse.

44:02.396 --> 44:04.336
No ghosts, no magic.

44:04.336 --> 44:06.116
I suppose you're right.

44:06.116 --> 44:08.876
Dwelling on it is not worth it.

44:08.876 --> 44:11.416
Perhaps I'll open
our doors to the public.

44:11.416 --> 44:16.276
People love these so-called
haunted houses. An intriguing idea.

44:16.276 --> 44:18.836
I might haunt it when I die.

44:18.836 --> 44:21.716
Which, given my family history,
could be any day now.

44:25.356 --> 44:27.936
That was a joke, Detective.

44:27.936 --> 44:29.536
Glad to hear it.

44:29.536 --> 44:34.476
Well, thank you for everything.

44:34.476 --> 44:36.076
Good day, Mr Beaton.

44:36.076 --> 44:38.996
And, superstition be damned,
good luck.

44:50.376 --> 44:52.036
HE STRAINS

44:52.036 --> 44:53.876
Mr Beaton?

44:53.876 --> 44:55.336
Mr Beaton!
