Lovely room, Tony. It's very Paris 2007.

30:17.400 --> 30:19.153
Please tell Adam not to bother
to come out to see me.

30:19.320 --> 30:23.519
I'm sure he's very...
busy, it being opening night.

30:23.920 --> 30:26.116
Maybe not that busy.

30:26.280 --> 30:28.237
Come on! What the fuck is this bullshit!

30:28.400 --> 30:30.676
Table four, right now! Clean the pass!

Did I make a mistake this morning

30:33.320 --> 30:35.277
when I went, "How much did I order?"

30:35.440 --> 30:37.557
That can't be right!
Michel, where's my pig?

30:37.720 --> 30:39.359
Yes, chef. Coming, chef.

33:16.760 --> 33:19.320
- I gave you this to use, right?
- Yes, chef.

33:19.480 --> 33:21.631
Because each slice
of potato for pommes Anna

33:21.800 --> 33:23.439
has to be exactly two millimeters thick.

- No, chef.

33:26.200 --> 33:28.715

- No, there was no time.

33:28.880 --> 33:30.234
There's no time. You just have to know.

33:30.440 --> 33:32.511

Michel you allowed a portion of scallops

33:37.160 --> 33:38.660
to remain in the pan for an extra minute

33:38.760 --> 33:40.956
because the garnish wasn't ready

46:59.560 --> 47:00.914
Mommy, I want some biscuits.

47:01.080 --> 47:02.480
We're late.
We'll get something on the way.

47:02.640 --> 47:05.155
And Granny'll bring you a surprise when
she picks you up from school, okay?

47:05.320 --> 47:07.357
Sweetheart, please, come on.
Lily, we're late.

47:07.520 --> 47:10.354
Lil? Please. Come on.

47:10.520 --> 47:12.477
One, two, three.

47:13.480 --> 47:16.632
Have a look at the new menu.
A few items will seem familiar.

47:16.800 --> 47:18.871
Most are new.

47:19.040 --> 47:22.033
And most of our guests will be
a bit uncomfortable at first.

47:22.200 --> 47:24.192
Do you know about the Michelin men?

47:24.400 --> 47:28.110
- It is a book.
- It is the book, Yana. The Bible.

47:28.320 --> 47:31.791
TONY: Michelin sends its inspectors
to restaurants to eat and award stars.

47:31.960 --> 47:34.759
- One. Two. Three.
- Or none.

47:35.600 --> 47:37.910
No one knows who they are. No one.

47:38.120 --> 47:39.554
They come, they eat, they go.

47:39.720 --> 47:42.440
But they have habits.
They have to stick to a routine

47:42.600 --> 47:44.193
to give every restaurant
the same chance.

47:44.360 --> 47:46.192
Michelin men eat in pairs.

47:46.360 --> 47:48.511
KAITLIN: Sometimes the Michelin man
could even be a woman.

47:48.680 --> 47:50.831
They always book a table before 7:30.

47:51.000 --> 47:53.720
The first of the pair arrives early
and has a drink at the bar.

47:53.880 --> 47:55.394
His partner arrives half an hour later.

47:55.600 --> 47:58.718
One orders the tasting menu,
the other one a la carte. Always.

47:58.880 --> 48:00.519
They order half a bottle of wine.

48:00.680 --> 48:02.114
They ask for tap water.
They wear business suits.

48:02.280 --> 48:04.192
They're polite. But attention.

48:04.400 --> 48:05.754
They may place a fork on the floor,

48:05.920 --> 48:08.560
under the table to see if you notice,
and they wouldn't drop it

48:08.720 --> 48:10.040
because that could make
a noise and make it too easy.

48:10.240 --> 48:12.197
ADAM: Everything from now on
must be perfect.

48:12.360 --> 48:16.434
Not good, not excellent... perfect.

48:16.600 --> 48:20.276
If they find one single thing wrong,
they will kill us.

48:20.440 --> 48:22.432
And they will come for us soon.

48:27.040 --> 48:29.953
- How long on the lamb?
- MAX: Give me two more minutes, chef.

48:30.120 --> 48:31.520

48:31.720 --> 48:34.030
There are two men at the kitchen door

They're French.

48:38.080 --> 48:39.196
Service!

48:39.360 --> 48:40.760
Should I tell them
you left half an hour ago?

48:40.920 --> 48:44.231
- Canapes!
- No. They'll just come back.

48:45.480 --> 48:48.359
- Michel, to the pass.
- Yes, chef.

Stay.

50:05.680 --> 50:07.160
I want you to try something.

I'm working on a, uh,
Ratte potato and truffle.

of your beef sauce.

50:17.280 --> 50:18.839
That's good.

It's my daughter Lily's

50:25.880 --> 50:29.317
Conti used to let me have the day off
so that I could throw her a party.

50:29.480 --> 50:32.837
I was hoping I could maybe miss
the lunch service on Thursday.

50:36.880 --> 50:40.760
The problem with being good
is you become indispensable.

50:42.240 --> 50:44.152
I need you here all day Thursday.

If you're not careful,
she's gonna end up like you.

And we can't have a kitchen
with two of you in it.

51:38.240 --> 51:40.357
It's the end of service.
She should be fine.

51:40.520 --> 51:42.796
If not, we need to know that.

51:45.520 --> 51:47.432
She wants to be like us.

51:47.600 --> 51:49.432
In order to do that,
she's got to live the life.

Yes.

He didn't relaunch the restaurant
to impress his father.

52:47.200 --> 52:49.431
- He did it for you.
- Yeah.

52:52.360 --> 52:54.591
He wants you to get your third star.

Even after all the pain
you've caused him.

01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:58.709
We wouldn't even be talking.

01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:01.440
I've been working more
on the potato truffle veloute.

01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:03.160
I think we should put it
on the menu tomorrow,

01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:05.471
as a sort of modern take
on sole bonne femme.

01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:08.235
Michelin loves it when
you celebrate French cuisine.

01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:11.472
- You look great by the way.
- Thank you.

01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:12.790
- Hello.
- Oh, hi, nice to meet you.

01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:14.189
MAN: This is Montgomery Reece.
This is Marcus.

01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:15.714
- Marcus.
- Nice to meet you, sir.

01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:17.792
Marcus, is, uh, actually one of
the investors in the other restaurant.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.356
REECE: Excellent.
Well, thank you very much.

01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:24.960
Hello, Jones.
You find a nice flat surface yet?

01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:28.759
I take it you are the saucier he's been
trying to hide from me this whole time,

01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:31.310
in which case,
when you do get tired of him,

01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:33.119
this is what you could be cooking.

01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:34.760
You're doing me almost as good as me.

01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:37.674
And you're using butter.
Where'd you come up with that idea?

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:39.274
WOMAN: Adam?

01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:45.995
I didn't invite her.
She came with another guest.

01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:54.550
Who is she?

01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:56.837
That is Jean Luc's daughter, Anne Marie.

01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:58.997
The Times just arrived.

01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:04.000
What are you doing here?

01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:06.595
I thought maybe you would
come to Papa's funeral.

01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:08.792
Yeah, I didn't know that he'd died.

01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:14.399
(EXHALES) I've missed you.

01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:18.593
I'm better now.
Been clean almost two years.

01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:22.915
(EXHALES) I went to a clinic in Milan.

01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:25.117
They helped me stop.

01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:29.793
You look good. Strong.

01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:32.391
- What do you want?
- (EXHALES)

01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:39.196
Papa wanted you to have his knives.

01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:45.238
Would you like me to send them?

01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:47.309
Yes, please.

01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:50.197
(SIGHS)

01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:54.395
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
We were beautiful together, you know?

01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:41.912
(♪ RY X: "LOVE LIKE THIS")

01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:17.279
Hi.

01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:19.318
Have you been here all night?

01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:20.800
How'd you find me?

01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:23.998
Couldn't sleep, then I remembered
sole bonne femme needs sole.

01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:27.270
Yeah, without skin.

01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:38.920
Sweeney's Irish,
by the way, not Scottish.

01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:42.032
It's my ex-husband's name.

01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:43.793
Leon Sweeney.

01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:47.437
Didn't work out, huh?

01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:49.512
It could have done.

01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:53.351
We were really good
for a long time, but...

01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:58.838
You know, we drank too much,
and partied too much and...

01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:03.350
I could stay up for days,
and he loved that about me.

01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:07.200
Then I got pregnant with Lily and,

01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:09.873
you know, I wanted to stop,
and he didn't.

01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:15.031
- Didn't or couldn't?
- What's the difference?

01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:19.640
Yeah.

01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:25.393
I worked in places like this
all the time when I was a kid.

01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:31.109
I saved up a bunch of money,
bought a one-way ticket to Paris.

01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:35.756
Lied my way into Jean Luc's kitchen.

01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:42.240
That's when Max was there, and Reece,
and, uh, Michel came later.

01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:47.875
I didn't speak any French.

01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:51.559
Worked 20-hour days, six days a week.

01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:54.113
I was 19 years old.

01:06:56.120 --> 01:06:57.554
I loved every minute of it.

01:06:57.720 --> 01:07:01.714
The heat, the pressure, the violence,
the fucking screaming.

01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:04.558
You know, all the cooks.

01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:11.556
That kitchen is the only place
I've ever felt like I really belonged.

01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:15.678
Why?

01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:18.919
What happened in Paris?

01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:22.953
I just fucked it all up.

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:26.155
Maybe it's...

01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:31.558
Maybe I just wanted it really bad,
and then when I got it too early,

01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:34.713
I didn't know how to hold on to it.
I tried to control everything.

01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:38.436
Then when I wanted to escape from it...

01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:45.389
Five o'clock's always the worst time
for thinking things.

01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:47.870
I always think of things,
like I make a list of, like,

01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:49.753
things and people
I always think about right now.

01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:51.917
It's like my mom,
my grandmother, Jean Luc.

01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:53.878
It's like a broken fucking record.

01:07:57.160 --> 01:07:58.833
That woman at the party
was really pretty.

01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:03.159
- Is she on your list?
- Nope.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.912
Her perfume was amazing.

01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:10.160
You smell okay.

01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:12.835
(LAUGHS) Thank you.

01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:17.318
What about Tony? Is he on your list?

01:08:17.479 --> 01:08:18.880
Yeah, he's there.

01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:22.792
I worry maybe I'm too hard on him.

01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:24.997
At about 6:00, I decide it's okay.

01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:26.554
(CHUCKLES)

01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:29.877
And there's you.

01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:33.073
- Wait, I'm on the list?
- Yeah, apparently so.

01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:35.515
It's getting to be a long list.
No wonder I don't sleep.

01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:37.956
Why are you thinking
about me at 5:00 a.m.?

01:08:41.399 --> 01:08:43.551
I just think you and I
are exactly the same, you know?

01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:46.273
All we want to do...

01:08:47.439 --> 01:08:48.760
Thanks...

01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:51.354
...is just fry some fucking fish.

01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:52.993
(CHUCKLES)

01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:57.511
HELENE: I'm thinking of doing that
sauce with a chicken stock base,

01:08:57.640 --> 01:08:59.631
a white chicken stock,
just to lighten it up a bit.

01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:03.234
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:09:07.279 --> 01:09:08.872
Adam.

01:09:09.399 --> 01:09:10.754
Yeah?

01:09:35.439 --> 01:09:37.636
(SOFTLY) This is a fucking stupid idea.

01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:39.756
(SOFTLY) It was your idea.

01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:41.399
(CHUCKLES)

(CAR DOOR OPENS)

01:09:58.600 --> 01:09:59.750
No water bath, okay?

01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:01.360
Just slowly baste them
in butter on either side.

01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:02.749
What?

01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:05.435
Okay, and then confit
the rattes and then peel,

01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:08.559
emulsify in butter,
stock, truffles, okay?

01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:12.915
Who are they?

01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:14.992
Thirty seconds, no more.

01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:31.276
In Paris, it happened two times a week.
I used to worry, now I don't.

01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:33.432
Believe me, the only person

01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:36.069
who will kill Adam Jones is Adam Jones.

01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:42.840
Oh, Helene.

01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:53.196
"Oh, Helene" what?

01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:12.840
Adam?

01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:17.071
- (GROANS)
- Jesus.

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:20.118
(SPITS, COUGHS) I'm okay.

01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:21.760
What the hell was that?
Who were those men?

01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:23.917
- I still owe some people some money.
- Just pay them.

01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:25.992
- It's a lot of money.
- You think you can walk?

01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:28.436
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- You have to go and see a doctor, Adam.

01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:29.829
- No, service.
- No, you're not cooking, Adam.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.151
We can handle it, all right?
Just tell me quickly.

01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:33.800
Do you want me to baste them in butter?

01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:36.634
- Slowly, and then peel and emulsify.
- Jesus, you're as bad as he is.

- KAITLIN: Tony. Tony!
- What?

There's a man... There's a man
at the bar. He's wearing a suit.

His friend arrived half an hour later.

01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:44.999
