Castle: Boom!

00:34.747 --> 00:35.981
"Hello.

00:36.015 --> 00:38.383
I'm serious and brooding
Richard Castle."

00:38.417 --> 00:42.354
"And I am friendly, accessible,

00:42.388 --> 00:44.656
ruggedly handsome
Richard Castle."

00:44.690 --> 00:45.457
Alexis: Wow, dad.

00:45.491 --> 00:47.158
Could your head get any bigger?

00:47.192 --> 00:48.159
Can you blame me?

00:48.193 --> 00:49.060
I'm accepting

00:49.094 --> 00:51.062
the poe's pen career
achievement award.

00:51.096 --> 00:54.098
It is the biggest honor
a mystery writer can get.

00:54.132 --> 00:56.234
I am joining
the pantheon of greats

00:56.268 --> 00:58.202
to whose heights
I have always aspired.

00:58.237 --> 00:59.837
So which big head?

00:59.872 --> 01:03.674
Uh, I like the ruggedly
handsome, smiling giant you.

01:03.708 --> 01:06.177
I like the serious,
brooding giant you.

01:07.603 --> 01:09.680
All right, mother.
You are the tie-breaker.

01:09.714 --> 01:11.114
Which of these
should be hanging behind me

01:11.148 --> 01:12.516
- at the ceremony next week?
- Oh.

01:12.550 --> 01:14.585
Darling, you know I refuse
to play favorites.

01:14.619 --> 01:18.856
I love both of my son's
big heads equally.

01:18.890 --> 01:20.090
Beckett: [Chuckles]
All right.

01:20.124 --> 01:22.559
I am off to meet
a friend of mine

01:22.594 --> 01:24.528
whose father just passed away.

01:24.562 --> 01:26.062
Oh, Martha, I am so sorry.

01:26.097 --> 01:27.530
Oh, no, no. don't be.

01:27.564 --> 01:29.632
He had a r-rich, full life.

01:29.666 --> 01:33.937
And, more importantly, he has a
rent-controlled loft in Chelsea,

01:33.971 --> 01:36.039
which, if I play my cards right,
could be mine.

01:36.073 --> 01:37.073
[Squeals softly] Bye.

01:37.108 --> 01:38.579
[Cellphone chimes]

01:38.599 --> 01:41.577
Well, there's the "death as
opportunity" spirit we all love.

01:41.612 --> 01:44.380
Oh, looks like we have
an opportunity of our own.

01:44.415 --> 01:46.115
Oh! Let's head out.

01:46.149 --> 01:48.083
We'll go head-to-head later.

01:48.118 --> 01:49.719
See where I'm heading?
[Chuckles]

01:49.753 --> 01:52.121
You know, with this award,
you going for captain,

01:52.155 --> 01:53.656
we could be New York's
newest power couple.

01:53.690 --> 01:54.724
Oh, Castle, don't jinx it.

01:54.758 --> 01:57.259
I haven't even gotten
my exam results back yet.

01:57.294 --> 01:58.327
You, you aced it.

01:58.361 --> 02:01.397
No, man. It was that guy
with the ax in his heart.

02:01.431 --> 02:02.965
He bled out in the barcalounger.

02:02.999 --> 02:04.466
We called him
"lord of the flies," remember?

02:04.500 --> 02:05.667
No, no, no. You're wrong, bro.

02:05.701 --> 02:08.502
It was the pet-shop owner
whose wife fed him to the dogs.

02:08.538 --> 02:09.437
What are you guys
fighting about?

02:09.472 --> 02:10.906
Uh, the first case
that Captain Montgomery

02:10.941 --> 02:12.174
partnered us on
10 years ago today.

02:12.208 --> 02:14.109
Really? It's your manniversary?

02:14.144 --> 02:15.177
And I didn't get you anything.

02:15.211 --> 02:16.177
There's still time.

02:16.211 --> 02:17.679
You the folks from the 12th?

02:17.713 --> 02:18.680
I'm Trooper Collins.

02:18.714 --> 02:19.848
Thanks for coming
out of your jurisdiction.

02:19.882 --> 02:21.282
Our victim's a Jane Doe.

02:21.317 --> 02:22.851
It appears
she was attacked in the woods

02:22.885 --> 02:23.618
and chased onto the road,

02:23.653 --> 02:25.119
where she was hit by that truck.

02:25.154 --> 02:26.054
Because of the assault,

02:26.088 --> 02:27.789
we're classifying the death
as a homicide.

02:27.824 --> 02:29.023
Any idea
where she was coming from?

02:29.058 --> 02:30.258
It's state game land.

02:30.292 --> 02:31.693
Not a house for miles.

02:31.727 --> 02:33.361
- Any I.D. on the body?
- No.

02:33.395 --> 02:35.196
And we ran her prints,
but they're not on file.

02:35.230 --> 02:37.131
We've got our teams out there
searching the woods,

02:37.166 --> 02:39.367
but we found these
tucked into her bra.

02:39.401 --> 02:42.937
$50 bill, key card,
and a cash receipt.

02:42.972 --> 02:46.441
From a coffee shop in the city,
dated yesterday.

02:46.475 --> 02:47.342
This card
looks like a hotel key.

02:47.376 --> 02:48.976
But it's not
from anywhere around here.

02:49.010 --> 02:50.811
We think maybe she was
staying in the city.

02:50.846 --> 02:52.446
We were hoping you could
help us track down who she is

02:52.481 --> 02:53.714
and what she was doing here.

02:53.748 --> 02:55.254
Beckett: Yeah, of course.

03:04.759 --> 03:06.460
Trooper Collins?

03:06.494 --> 03:07.660
These carvings on her face?

03:07.695 --> 03:09.154
The crosses?

03:09.340 --> 03:10.697
Freaky, right?

03:10.731 --> 03:13.233
We think she was maybe
running from whoever did that.

03:13.267 --> 03:14.401
They look ritualistic.

03:14.435 --> 03:16.370
Yeah. And it gets freakier.

03:16.404 --> 03:17.971
Just as that trucker
hit the girl,

03:18.006 --> 03:20.207
he says he saw
something emerge from the woods.

03:20.241 --> 03:21.241
Some <i>thing?</i>

03:21.275 --> 03:22.709
A dark figure wearing a mask.

03:22.743 --> 03:24.544
What kind of mask?

03:24.578 --> 03:25.745
He was pretty shaken,
so we didn't press.

03:25.779 --> 03:28.214
We'll get a full statement
from him once he's been treated.

03:28.248 --> 03:29.215
Where is he?

03:29.249 --> 03:30.517
At the hospital in Woodbury.

03:30.551 --> 03:32.619
Excuse me. Trooper Collins. Go.

03:35.788 --> 03:37.724
We need to talk to that driver.

03:37.758 --> 03:39.558
I tried to stop. I did.

03:39.592 --> 03:40.959
But she just came
out of nowhere.

03:40.994 --> 03:43.823
Mr. Walters, the trooper said you
saw something in the woods.

03:43.843 --> 03:45.864
Yeah. It almost didn't seem real...

03:45.899 --> 03:48.286
like it was some kind of ghost.

03:48.306 --> 03:49.601
Freaky as all hell.

03:49.636 --> 03:50.836
Can you describe it?

03:50.870 --> 03:52.938
It wore a dark ragged coat

03:52.972 --> 03:55.507
with a mask like a doll's face.

03:55.542 --> 03:56.775
Like porcelain?

03:56.809 --> 03:57.910
Yeah.

03:57.944 --> 04:01.246
It was white, with black
where the eyes should have been.

04:01.280 --> 04:02.414
Were there markings on it?

04:02.448 --> 04:04.550
- Yeah.
- Like what?

04:04.584 --> 04:06.552
Like streaked teardrops
coming from the eyes.

04:06.586 --> 04:09.421
Uh, and the... the face,
it was, uh...

04:09.455 --> 04:11.756
bisected with two black lines,
like a cross.

04:11.790 --> 04:12.790
Yeah.

04:12.824 --> 04:14.059
How'd you know that?

04:14.093 --> 04:15.860
Castle, what's going on?

04:15.894 --> 04:18.262
It was real.

04:18.297 --> 04:19.964
What was real?

04:19.998 --> 04:22.618
Beckett, I've seen
that mask before.

04:31.039 --> 04:33.273
Beckett: The sketch
is from the truck driver.

04:35.309 --> 04:37.944
You ready to talk about it?

04:40.215 --> 04:41.815
I was 11 years old.

04:43.849 --> 04:46.518
Uh, my mother
was touring with "Pippin."

04:46.552 --> 04:47.986
I was in New Hampshire,

04:48.020 --> 04:50.822
staying with the family
of a classmate

04:50.856 --> 04:52.457
for presidents' day weekend.

04:52.492 --> 04:56.358
Their home abutted a few hundred
acres of state forest

04:56.378 --> 04:57.956
called Hollander's Woods.

04:57.976 --> 05:00.329
We were told never
to go into the woods alone.

05:00.349 --> 05:03.509
Somebody told you not to,
so you had to do it anyway.

05:04.503 --> 05:07.304
I walked for hours.

05:07.339 --> 05:11.183
I was cold, completely lost.

05:11.203 --> 05:13.277
And that's when I saw him...

05:13.311 --> 05:17.281
a figure clad in black,
kneeling.

05:17.657 --> 05:20.914
And after a few moments,
he left.

05:20.934 --> 05:23.887
And that's when I saw her
on the ground.

05:23.921 --> 05:24.979
"Her"?

05:24.999 --> 05:26.452
A body.

05:26.472 --> 05:28.892
First body I ever saw.

05:29.787 --> 05:32.721
Her throat had been slit,
and those same symbols

05:32.741 --> 05:35.967
were carved into her forehead
and her cheeks.

05:37.146 --> 05:38.261
I touched her arm.

05:38.281 --> 05:40.904
I remember thinking
how cold it was.

05:42.807 --> 05:45.261
Tell anyone
what you've seen here today,

05:45.281 --> 05:48.378
and I'll find you and kill you.

05:48.412 --> 05:50.768
Do you understand?

05:52.754 --> 05:53.950
Go!

05:55.282 --> 05:57.153
Why do you think
he let you live?

05:57.687 --> 05:59.021
I don't know.

05:59.041 --> 06:00.727
I waited till I got back
to the city

06:00.747 --> 06:02.495
to call the police
from a pay phone.

06:02.515 --> 06:04.694
I was too scared
to let them know who I was.

06:04.728 --> 06:06.191
And who was the girl?

06:06.211 --> 06:07.308
That's just the thing.

06:07.328 --> 06:09.061
They searched the woods
with cadaver dogs.

06:09.081 --> 06:11.031
They never found a body.

06:11.186 --> 06:13.125
So you never figured out
who she was?

06:13.145 --> 06:14.504
I checked local papers.

06:14.538 --> 06:16.491
No one in the area
had been reported missing.

06:16.511 --> 06:18.452
When I got older,
I checked with missing persons,

06:18.472 --> 06:19.895
even the f.B.I. Database,

06:19.915 --> 06:21.927
for anyone
matching her description

06:21.947 --> 06:25.361
or any crimes involving
those symbols or that mask,

06:25.381 --> 06:27.232
but there was nothing.

06:27.402 --> 06:29.619
It's like it never happened.

06:29.653 --> 06:33.155
And after a while,
I started to wonder if it had.

06:33.807 --> 06:35.524
That day in the woods, Kate...

06:35.558 --> 06:38.427
that's why I do what I do.

06:38.864 --> 06:40.829
I'm driven to figure out
the story

06:40.863 --> 06:45.267
because I could never
figure out that one.

06:46.096 --> 06:48.842
Why didn't you ever
tell me this before?

06:49.043 --> 06:51.257
I think I didn't want it
to be real.

06:51.277 --> 06:53.289
But it <i>is</i> real.

06:53.309 --> 06:55.343
He's real.

06:55.377 --> 06:56.811
He killed before,

06:56.846 --> 07:01.049
and he just tried to kill again.

07:01.566 --> 07:03.484
I checked
with the police department

07:03.519 --> 07:04.886
near Hollander's Woods.

07:04.920 --> 07:06.821
Their logs do show
that they received a call

07:06.856 --> 07:08.903
in February of '83
reporting a body.

07:08.923 --> 07:11.392
But after coming up empty,
they assumed it was a prank.

07:11.426 --> 07:13.528
Okay, what about
the F.B.I. database?

07:13.562 --> 07:15.496
There's been no other
occurrences in the past 30 years

07:15.531 --> 07:18.981
of any assaults or murders
with this M.O.

07:19.322 --> 07:22.761
Beckett, this thing
that Castle says happened,

07:22.781 --> 07:24.172
it was decades ago.

07:24.206 --> 07:25.473
Is he really sure about this?

07:25.507 --> 07:27.074
As sure as I've ever seen him.

07:27.108 --> 07:29.176
- Hmm.
- So, our Jane Doe...

07:29.210 --> 07:30.711
anything
on that coffee-shop receipt?

07:30.745 --> 07:32.980
Yeah, a barista there
remembered seeing our victim.

07:33.014 --> 07:34.181
She wasn't a regular,

07:34.215 --> 07:35.983
but she had been in several
times in the past few days.

07:36.017 --> 07:37.250
Was anyone with her?

07:37.285 --> 07:38.552
No. She came in alone.

07:38.586 --> 07:40.054
She'd get her drink,
take a seat,

07:40.088 --> 07:42.555
and spend hours
staring out the window.

07:42.912 --> 07:44.929
Okay, why don't we set up
a canvass of the neighborhood?

07:44.949 --> 07:47.111
Maybe someone there
knows who she is.

07:47.131 --> 07:47.827
After all these years,

07:47.861 --> 07:50.597
do you really think
it could be the same killer?

07:50.631 --> 07:52.599
We won't know until we find him.

07:52.633 --> 07:53.567
Esposito: Yo.

07:53.601 --> 07:55.502
That key card
that we found on the victim?

07:55.536 --> 07:58.377
It was tracked to an extended-stay
motel out in Queens.

07:59.240 --> 08:01.007
She paid cash for the room.

08:01.041 --> 08:02.508
Didn't present an I.D.

08:02.542 --> 08:04.210
Registered as Jane Smith.

08:04.244 --> 08:06.512
Not her real name, I'm guessing.

08:06.546 --> 08:08.581
So we still don't know
who she is.

08:08.615 --> 08:10.583
Did she have a car when
she checked in?

08:10.617 --> 08:12.206
No. Cab dropped her off.

08:12.226 --> 08:14.453
Which means
someone took her to those woods.

08:14.487 --> 08:16.222
How long
has she been staying here?

08:16.256 --> 08:18.009
About two weeks. [Door opens]

08:19.669 --> 08:20.859
Espo, check the drawers.

08:20.893 --> 08:23.826
See if we can find anything
to I.D. our victim.

08:33.667 --> 08:35.171
Beckett.

08:39.034 --> 08:40.879
Photos. All of the same woman?

08:40.913 --> 08:42.647
And look at this.

08:43.597 --> 08:45.650
- License plate numbers.
- Hundreds of them,

08:45.684 --> 08:48.120
along with the registered
address of each vehicle.

08:48.154 --> 08:49.454
Why would she have that?

08:49.488 --> 08:51.155
Look at the plate numbers.

08:51.189 --> 08:53.124
Each one has the letters "x"
and "z" in it.

08:53.158 --> 08:55.159
Our victim was looking
for someone specific.

08:55.193 --> 08:56.561
Yeah, but who?

08:56.595 --> 08:58.635
I think
I know someone we can ask.

09:00.900 --> 09:03.222
Frank: I knew something bad
would happen to Emma.

09:03.242 --> 09:05.970
I was trying to find her,
to... to stop her.

09:06.004 --> 09:09.491
Mr. Malloy, what was
your daughter doing in the city?

09:09.770 --> 09:12.777
Two months ago,
a friend of hers disappeared.

09:12.811 --> 09:14.982
Emma was trying to find her.

09:15.463 --> 09:16.981
Wait.
[Paper rustling]

09:17.015 --> 09:18.649
Was this her friend?

09:18.683 --> 09:21.229
Yeah. Zoey Addison.

09:21.249 --> 09:24.377
And what exactly do you mean
by "she disappeared"?

09:24.397 --> 09:27.243
Zoey had a boyfriend
that was beating on her.

09:27.263 --> 09:29.957
So she took his car and was
on her way to stay with Emma.

09:29.977 --> 09:31.328
But she never showed.

09:31.362 --> 09:33.630
Couple days later,
the cops found the car

09:33.665 --> 09:36.333
by the side of the road
with a busted radiator...

09:36.630 --> 09:38.115
But no sign of Zoey.

09:38.135 --> 09:40.170
- Did they talk to the boyfriend?
- Oh, yeah.

09:40.204 --> 09:42.772
But he was two states away
with an alibi.

09:42.807 --> 09:43.840
He reported the car stolen,

09:43.874 --> 09:46.209
so the cops just figured
that Zoey was on the run

09:46.243 --> 09:48.211
and ditched it for another ride.

09:48.754 --> 09:50.479
But Emma knew that Zoey
wouldn't do that...

09:50.514 --> 09:51.651
not without calling.

09:51.671 --> 09:53.883
So Emma took a leave
from her cashier's job

09:53.918 --> 09:56.118
to try to find her,
retracing her route.

09:56.152 --> 09:58.454
Em found a waitress
at a truck stop

09:58.488 --> 10:00.809
who saw Zoey get
in the back of a white Sedan.

10:00.829 --> 10:03.659
With New York plates containing
the letters "x" and "z"?

10:03.694 --> 10:04.593
Yeah.

10:04.628 --> 10:06.696
The waitress told Emma
it had an oval sticker

10:06.730 --> 10:08.664
in its back window
that said "NYC."

10:08.699 --> 10:10.199
That's what she was doing
in the city.

10:10.233 --> 10:13.001
She was trying to track
the car Zoey got into.

10:13.036 --> 10:15.637
Mr. Malloy, do these woods
mean anything to you?

10:15.671 --> 10:17.901
Is there any reason
that Emma would be in them?

10:17.921 --> 10:19.308
Were they on Zoey's route,
maybe?

10:19.328 --> 10:20.596
Somewhere near
where she disappeared?

10:20.616 --> 10:23.378
Zoey was coming from Pittsburgh,
the opposite direction.

10:23.412 --> 10:27.182
And all this time, no one's
heard anything from her?

10:27.564 --> 10:30.251
Zoey didn't have family.

10:30.285 --> 10:32.322
And if it wasn't for Emma,

10:32.342 --> 10:35.590
no one would have even known
that she'd disappeared.

10:35.624 --> 10:37.859
Castle: That's why I
could never find the girl

10:37.893 --> 10:39.193
I saw in the woods.

10:39.228 --> 10:40.928
He targets people
who won't be missed...

10:40.963 --> 10:42.831
hitchhikers, stranded motorists.

10:42.865 --> 10:44.899
He asks them
a couple of questions.

10:44.933 --> 10:47.201
If they fit the profile,
he kills them.

10:47.236 --> 10:50.738
And if not, he's just some good
samaritan giving them a ride.

10:50.772 --> 10:52.325
That's why he didn't kill me.

10:52.345 --> 10:54.001
It would have
attracted attention.

10:54.021 --> 10:55.576
30 years.

10:55.610 --> 10:57.511
How many times
do you think he did this? 10?

10:57.545 --> 10:59.322
20? 100?

10:59.342 --> 11:01.382
I should have found
a way to stop him.

11:01.416 --> 11:03.450
Castle, you were 11 years old.

11:03.485 --> 11:05.719
And what happened to you
back then was terrible.

11:05.754 --> 11:07.788
And I know that you're
thinking of this case

11:07.822 --> 11:09.089
as a way
to exorcise those demons,

11:09.123 --> 11:10.691
but we don't know
what we have here.

11:10.725 --> 11:12.526
We don't even know
if this is the same person.

11:12.560 --> 11:14.094
Of course it's the same person.

11:14.128 --> 11:17.327
See, Emma must have been able
to do what I never could.

11:17.347 --> 11:18.899
She tracked him down.

11:18.933 --> 11:20.479
That's why he went after her.

11:20.499 --> 11:22.702
I have to find this guy, Kate.

11:22.736 --> 11:24.637
I need to end this.

11:24.671 --> 11:26.776
[Footsteps approaching]

11:26.796 --> 11:29.742
Guys, is there any way

11:29.777 --> 11:31.444
to check police records
from 30 years ago?

11:31.478 --> 11:33.713
See if there were
any abandoned cars

11:33.747 --> 11:36.057
ticketed within a 50-mile
radius of Hollander's Woods?

11:36.077 --> 11:37.417
Sure. We just have to call

11:37.451 --> 11:39.454
all the municipal police
departments in the area...

11:39.474 --> 11:42.154
And wait for them
to stop laughing long enough

11:42.188 --> 11:45.053
to beg them to check
their dusty storage rooms.

11:46.045 --> 11:46.862
You serious?

11:46.882 --> 11:49.375
We need to know exactly
what we're dealing with here,

11:49.395 --> 11:51.536
so happy manniversary.

11:52.765 --> 11:55.267
Detective Beckett. A word?

11:58.176 --> 11:59.939
- Close the door.
- Oh, yeah.

12:00.270 --> 12:01.307
[Door closes]

12:01.341 --> 12:03.475
Gates: I just got a call
from 1PP.

12:03.509 --> 12:05.177
They want me to take you
off shift tonight

12:05.211 --> 12:06.845
for a performance review.

12:06.879 --> 12:08.413
Um, sir,

12:08.448 --> 12:11.182
my review's not scheduled
for another three months.

12:11.216 --> 12:12.951
D-do you think
that this has something

12:12.985 --> 12:14.305
to do with the captain's exam?

12:14.325 --> 12:17.322
No, they don't ask for a meet
to discuss exam results.

12:17.356 --> 12:19.324
They notify you by mail.

12:19.358 --> 12:21.793
[Breathes deeply]
So w-what's going on?

12:21.828 --> 12:24.362
I don't know, and none
of my sources are talking.

12:24.396 --> 12:26.664
But they want you there at 7:30.

12:28.036 --> 12:29.667
Well, maybe it's good news.

12:29.701 --> 12:31.061
Maybe you're getting
an award, too...

12:31.081 --> 12:33.771
"career achievement
in homicide."

12:33.805 --> 12:35.615
Yeah, okay,
it's probably not that.

12:35.635 --> 12:36.674
But, still,
it could be good news.

12:36.708 --> 12:39.426
Well, then why is my cop sense
telling me it's bad?

12:39.446 --> 12:42.580
Hey, guys. Got something.

12:42.614 --> 12:44.848
I was running those license
plates on Emma's list,

12:44.883 --> 12:47.485
seeing if any of the owners
have criminal backgrounds,

12:47.519 --> 12:49.620
when I noticed this car
registered to an address

12:49.655 --> 12:51.522
right down the street
from the coffee shop

12:51.556 --> 12:54.425
where Emma went
the day she was killed.

12:54.459 --> 12:55.693
She was surveilling that car.

12:55.727 --> 12:57.161
She must have thought
it was the one

12:57.195 --> 12:58.695
that Zoey got into
at the truck stop.

12:58.729 --> 13:01.331
And when the owner of the car
realized she was onto him,

13:01.365 --> 13:03.093
- he went after her.
- Whose car is it?

13:03.113 --> 13:05.575
That's the weird thing.
It belongs to this woman.

13:06.227 --> 13:07.570
Connie Lewis.

13:07.605 --> 13:10.007
But she's 72
and has no criminal record.

13:10.041 --> 13:11.641
What's her address?

13:11.873 --> 13:13.143
There it is.

13:13.178 --> 13:15.545
White sedan,
"x" and "z" in the plate,

13:16.035 --> 13:17.781
"NYC" sticker in the window.

13:17.815 --> 13:19.549
Exactly as Emma's witness
described.

13:19.583 --> 13:21.518
Yeah, but how's
a 72-year-old woman

13:21.552 --> 13:23.325
connected to all of this?

13:25.792 --> 13:27.284
You okay?

13:27.439 --> 13:30.893
After all these years, I may
finally get some answers.

13:30.928 --> 13:32.461
[Knock on door]

13:32.495 --> 13:33.662
Mrs. Lewis?

13:33.697 --> 13:35.490
NYPD.
[Knock on door]

13:35.878 --> 13:37.491
It's open.

13:39.399 --> 13:41.237
TV's on.

13:41.271 --> 13:43.668
Mrs. Lewis, can you hear me?!

13:54.617 --> 13:56.176
Mrs. Lewis?

14:01.512 --> 14:03.079
Mrs. Lewis?

14:04.754 --> 14:06.627
Mrs. Lewis?

14:07.696 --> 14:09.231
Mrs. Lewis?

14:14.183 --> 14:16.440
There were no outward signs
of trauma

14:16.460 --> 14:17.798
or carvings in her skin.

14:17.818 --> 14:19.353
But until I get her
back to the morgue,

14:19.387 --> 14:20.621
we can't rule out homicide.

14:20.655 --> 14:21.888
How long has she been dead?

14:21.922 --> 14:24.864
Based on decay,
I'd say about three years.

14:24.884 --> 14:26.260
How did no one notice?

14:26.280 --> 14:28.995
The killer did,
and he used her car.

14:29.196 --> 14:30.996
And maybe her place.

14:31.291 --> 14:32.795
Esposito: Beckett.

14:33.500 --> 14:35.583
Look what I found
in the kitchen.

14:35.846 --> 14:38.297
The same matchbook that we found
in Emma's hotel room.

14:38.317 --> 14:39.338
If Emma was tailing the killer,

14:39.373 --> 14:40.759
she could have
followed him there.

14:40.779 --> 14:43.148
I tracked down
Lewis' next of kin.

14:43.168 --> 14:45.711
Only family listed is a son.

14:45.746 --> 14:48.046
Found this number for him
in her things.

14:48.081 --> 14:49.682
910 area code?
Where's that from?

14:49.716 --> 14:51.083
- North Carolina.
- Okay.

14:51.117 --> 14:54.049
I'll handle the notification,
see what he knows.

14:54.069 --> 14:56.555
Not much, if he hasn't seen her
in three years. [Dialing]

14:56.590 --> 14:58.591
What kind of a son
doesn't check on his own mother?

14:58.625 --> 15:00.025
[Ringing]
Not all families get along.

15:00.059 --> 15:02.495
My father didn't talk
to his brother for 20 years.

15:03.128 --> 15:05.363
[Cellphone ringing] Shh.

15:12.571 --> 15:14.506
[Ringing continues]

15:20.826 --> 15:22.155
Esposito: It's empty.

15:22.175 --> 15:24.549
Check for the phone.

15:24.583 --> 15:26.147
It's been moved.

15:32.739 --> 15:35.035
You inside, drop your weapon!

15:36.394 --> 15:37.761
There's a hole in the floor.

15:37.796 --> 15:39.864
You guys, he's below us.
Let's go!

15:46.939 --> 15:48.572
Hey!

16:03.934 --> 16:05.532
Noah Lewis. 52.

16:05.552 --> 16:07.491
He did a stint in the army
back in the '90s.

16:07.525 --> 16:09.592
There's no recent record
of employment.

16:09.626 --> 16:11.794
He told the neighbors that
his mother was bedridden

16:11.829 --> 16:13.055
and that he was taking care
of her.

16:13.075 --> 16:15.265
So they just assumed
that he was the good son.

16:15.299 --> 16:17.234
Yeah, but the relationship
was far from rosy.

16:17.268 --> 16:18.902
Four years ago,
his mother had him committed

16:18.936 --> 16:20.237
to a state mental institution

16:20.271 --> 16:21.546
after he threatened her
with a knife.

16:21.566 --> 16:23.840
So I got in touch
with the state-appointed shrink

16:23.875 --> 16:24.638
who's treating him.

16:24.658 --> 16:26.933
He says that Noah has
borderline personality disorder

16:26.953 --> 16:29.136
and exhibited
violent tendencies.

16:29.156 --> 16:30.747
So it's him.

16:30.781 --> 16:32.648
Any record of where he was
30 years ago?

16:32.683 --> 16:34.817
Well, we're a little bit more
focused on where he is <i>now.</i>

16:34.852 --> 16:37.086
We have teams
still combing the neighborhood.

16:37.120 --> 16:39.121
We put out a bolo.
But so far, nothing.

16:39.155 --> 16:41.491
Your theory about the killer's M.O.
may have just paid off.

16:41.525 --> 16:42.624
You found something?

16:42.658 --> 16:44.626
Yeah, from February of '83.

16:44.660 --> 16:46.328
The day after you saw that body,

16:46.363 --> 16:48.530
police ticketed
an abandoned pickup truck

16:48.564 --> 16:51.466
they saw by the roadside
near Hollander's Woods.

16:51.501 --> 16:52.534
The truck belonged to a farmer

16:52.568 --> 16:55.470
who'd loaned it to
a young woman, a migrant worker,

16:55.505 --> 16:56.671
to go out and make a supply run.

16:56.706 --> 16:59.374
When the cops told the farmer
that they'd found his truck,

16:59.409 --> 17:02.533
he assumed
that she'd just run off.

17:03.075 --> 17:04.713
So he never reported
her missing.

17:04.747 --> 17:07.616
No. He didn't want to get her
in trouble with immigration.

17:08.008 --> 17:09.617
Did he remember who she was?

17:09.652 --> 17:10.618
Yeah.

17:10.653 --> 17:12.621
And he had a photo.

17:19.878 --> 17:21.329
What was her name?

17:21.554 --> 17:23.656
Rosalita Campo.

17:24.556 --> 17:26.700
Esposito:
We'll dig deeper into Noah,

17:26.734 --> 17:29.070
see if we can connect him
to that area 30 years ago.

17:31.769 --> 17:33.641
We'll find him, Castle.

17:33.675 --> 17:34.872
I promise.

17:35.042 --> 17:36.343
[Sighs]

17:36.377 --> 17:37.678
I'm supposed to head off
to my review.

17:37.712 --> 17:38.712
Do you want me to postpone?

17:38.747 --> 17:40.147
Uh, no. I should go with you.

17:40.181 --> 17:41.315
I'll be all right.

17:41.349 --> 17:42.516
I'll call you when I'm done,
okay?

17:42.551 --> 17:43.437
Okay.

17:43.457 --> 17:44.849
- Bye.
- Bye.

18:09.810 --> 18:11.210
[Knock on door]

18:11.244 --> 18:12.079
Hey.

18:12.099 --> 18:13.600
Hey.

18:13.948 --> 18:16.583
- Are you busy? I can...
- No, I was just, um...

18:16.893 --> 18:19.390
Reading something I wrote
a long time ago.

18:19.747 --> 18:22.188
Dad, how old were you
when you knew?

18:22.222 --> 18:23.789
Knew what?

18:23.823 --> 18:25.843
That you wanted to be a writer.

18:27.660 --> 18:29.462
Since I was a kid, I guess.

18:29.496 --> 18:30.840
Why?

18:30.860 --> 18:32.209
[Breathes deeply]

18:32.229 --> 18:35.482
I'm finishing my junior year,

18:35.502 --> 18:37.703
and I have no idea
what I want to do.

18:37.737 --> 18:39.471
By the time you were my age,

18:39.506 --> 18:40.906
you'd already published
your first book,

18:40.940 --> 18:43.375
and now you're winning
this amazing award

18:43.409 --> 18:45.617
because you followed
your passion.

18:45.637 --> 18:49.982
How can I be amazing
if I can't find mine?

18:50.720 --> 18:52.551
Trust me.

18:52.861 --> 18:54.272
You will.

18:54.292 --> 18:55.812
Or...

18:56.655 --> 18:58.456
Or it'll find you.

18:58.805 --> 19:00.591
And one day, you will look back,

19:00.626 --> 19:02.621
and you will realize that...

19:03.474 --> 19:05.630
Every experience you ever had,

19:05.664 --> 19:09.816
every seeming mistake
or blind alley,

19:09.836 --> 19:13.604
was actually a straight line

19:13.639 --> 19:16.176
to who you were meant to be.

19:17.835 --> 19:21.779
And whatever you become,
there's no question in my mind

19:21.813 --> 19:25.014
you are going to be amazing.

19:25.034 --> 19:26.651
And you know how I know?

19:26.685 --> 19:27.784
How?

19:27.818 --> 19:29.890
'Cause you already are.

19:43.235 --> 19:45.435
They're ready for you,
detective.

19:51.318 --> 19:52.900
Take a seat.

19:57.833 --> 20:00.149
So, Detective Beckett,

20:00.594 --> 20:02.685
says here you took
the captain's exam.

20:02.719 --> 20:04.441
Yes, sir.

20:05.294 --> 20:07.451
What you makes you think
you're qualified to be captain?

20:07.471 --> 20:09.559
My experience
in the 12th precinct

20:09.593 --> 20:11.961
has made me comfortable
in a leadership position,

20:11.995 --> 20:13.500
- and at this point...
- What I mean is...

20:13.520 --> 20:15.297
What makes you think
you're even qualified

20:15.317 --> 20:17.624
to be an NYPD detective?

20:18.368 --> 20:19.234
Sir?

20:19.268 --> 20:22.060
Your job is to enforce the law,

20:22.080 --> 20:24.006
yet you have
repeatedly ignored it.

20:24.040 --> 20:26.709
In Los Angeles,
you investigated a case

20:26.743 --> 20:28.295
- outside of your legal jurisdiction.
- But...

20:28.315 --> 20:31.246
you used your badge
to pursue a personal vendetta

20:31.280 --> 20:33.181
against Senator Bracken,
crossing the line

20:33.216 --> 20:35.517
and endangering the lives
of others numerous times.

20:35.551 --> 20:37.018
Sir, that man was a murderer.

20:37.052 --> 20:39.020
You've withheld
case information from superiors

20:39.054 --> 20:41.028
and flown in the face of
authority whenever it suits you,

20:41.048 --> 20:43.557
not to mention your working
relationship with Richard Castle.

20:43.577 --> 20:45.899
Tell me, detective,
how often have you let

20:45.919 --> 20:47.466
your personal feelings
for your husband

20:47.486 --> 20:49.017
dictate your actions
in pursuit of a suspect?

20:49.037 --> 20:51.297
Sir, that is unfair.
I never let...

20:51.317 --> 20:53.749
and when he went missing,
you used your position

20:53.769 --> 20:55.358
and a great deal
of the taxpayers' money

20:55.378 --> 20:58.706
to search for him, enlisting
the aid of fellow detectives.

20:59.779 --> 21:02.276
And, well, you are infamous
for being the inspiration

21:02.296 --> 21:04.634
for the fictional
NYPD detective Nikki Heat,

21:04.654 --> 21:06.759
who spends more time on her back

21:06.779 --> 21:09.410
than she does pursuing killers.

21:12.420 --> 21:14.374
Detective Beckett,
how do you expect to lead

21:14.394 --> 21:16.124
or even continue
in your current job

21:16.158 --> 21:18.841
when it's clear you've
exercised such poor judgment?

21:18.861 --> 21:20.795
Sir, if you would look
at my record...

21:20.829 --> 21:22.329
We <i>are</i> looking at your record.

21:22.364 --> 21:24.465
You are not qualified
for a captaincy,

21:24.499 --> 21:26.316
and in my opinion...

21:26.336 --> 21:29.159
You are not qualified
to be a detective.

21:33.502 --> 21:35.818
Thank you. You can go.

21:47.621 --> 21:50.091
You're wrong, sir.

21:50.991 --> 21:52.025
Excuse me?

21:52.059 --> 21:54.194
I said, "you're wrong."

21:54.481 --> 21:57.096
In every case
you have referenced,

21:57.413 --> 22:00.700
I have not only successfully
brought the killer to justice,

22:00.734 --> 22:03.403
but I did so with
the utmost respect for the law

22:03.437 --> 22:05.371
and for the department
I represent.

22:05.406 --> 22:07.544
And regarding my relationship
with Mr. Castle,

22:07.564 --> 22:10.543
he has proven to be
a brilliant partner,

22:10.577 --> 22:13.045
and he's always had my back.

22:13.079 --> 22:17.783
And as for his... fictional
representation of me,

22:18.192 --> 22:20.619
I'm proud to have been
his inspiration,

22:20.653 --> 22:23.125
and I am proud to be his wife.

22:23.776 --> 22:26.525
You asked,
"how do I expect to lead?"

22:26.559 --> 22:28.260
By continuing to fight
for what's right,

22:28.295 --> 22:29.691
not for what's easy.

22:29.711 --> 22:32.130
My job is to protect
the citizens of New York,

22:32.164 --> 22:35.033
and I will do it by doing
my job better than anyone else

22:35.067 --> 22:36.267
and getting results.

22:36.302 --> 22:38.470
I don't cross the line.

22:38.504 --> 22:40.706
I put myself on it.

22:40.740 --> 22:42.774
And if you have
any other questions,

22:42.809 --> 22:44.209
then you can ask the families

22:44.243 --> 22:46.824
of the victims
that I have served.

22:47.382 --> 22:49.057
Detective Beckett.

22:51.524 --> 22:52.951
Sit down.

23:01.092 --> 23:04.013
That was an impassioned
and powerful response.

23:04.033 --> 23:06.689
In fact, it was exactly
what we were hoping for.

23:06.875 --> 23:09.466
This wasn't
a performance review.

23:09.500 --> 23:11.637
Then why would you
attack me like that?

23:11.657 --> 23:13.837
We wanted to see
if you could defend yourself.

23:13.872 --> 23:15.572
Kate, this was an audition.

23:15.606 --> 23:16.806
For what?

23:16.841 --> 23:17.741
Your future.

23:17.775 --> 23:20.058
We've been looking
for someone like you...

23:20.078 --> 23:21.444
someone who isn't corruptible,

23:21.479 --> 23:24.681
a certifiable hero
who the people can get behind.

23:24.715 --> 23:26.683
Kate, you're bigger
than what you're doing now.

23:26.717 --> 23:27.884
You know it.

23:27.918 --> 23:31.646
It's why you went to D.C.,
why you took the captain's exam.

23:31.666 --> 23:34.051
You want a bigger stage,
and we want to give it to you.

23:34.071 --> 23:36.993
We think
you have an amazing future.

23:37.604 --> 23:39.161
Doing what?

23:39.196 --> 23:42.304
We'd like you to run
for New York State Senate.

23:45.881 --> 23:46.781
Castle: State senator?

23:46.815 --> 23:49.331
Beckett: And they say
it's just the start.

23:49.351 --> 23:52.294
Apparently the party has had
their eye on me for a while now.

23:52.314 --> 23:55.021
They think that people are
looking for someone like me.

23:55.613 --> 23:56.623
And what do <i>you</i> think?

23:56.658 --> 23:57.958
I don't know, Castle.

23:57.992 --> 24:01.261
I'm a cop, not a politician.

24:02.629 --> 24:03.596
Did I ever tell you

24:03.630 --> 24:06.071
that I was in a model u.N.
When I was a kid?

24:06.091 --> 24:08.294
My mom was one
of the chaperones.

24:08.314 --> 24:12.851
And after watching me,
she said, "you know, Katie...

24:12.871 --> 24:17.210
You can grow up
and be anything you want."

24:17.458 --> 24:19.479
I just wanted to be her.

24:19.513 --> 24:22.482
I just wanted to make
a difference.

24:22.516 --> 24:24.020
And you have.

24:24.237 --> 24:27.720
The question now is, can you
make a bigger difference?

24:27.754 --> 24:29.456
[Sighs]
Castle, if you saw the way

24:29.490 --> 24:31.056
that they attacked me
in that room...

24:31.091 --> 24:32.992
And in a campaign,
it would only be worse.

24:33.026 --> 24:35.294
You, Alexis, my dad, Martha...

24:35.328 --> 24:37.068
you guys would all be fair game.

24:37.088 --> 24:39.102
We're a tough bunch.

24:39.350 --> 24:41.238
So you think I could do it?

24:41.258 --> 24:43.321
I <i>know</i> you can.

24:43.755 --> 24:46.171
They said that I aced
my captain's exam.

24:46.206 --> 24:49.574
I could probably have my own
precinct within the year.

24:51.544 --> 24:53.093
When do you have to decide?

24:53.113 --> 24:54.646
Soon.

24:55.626 --> 24:58.150
Well, whatever you decide...

24:58.184 --> 24:59.651
I will back your play.

24:59.685 --> 25:01.520
Thank you.

25:02.126 --> 25:03.755
[Cellphone rings]

25:06.743 --> 25:07.425
[Cellphone beeps] Beckett.

25:07.459 --> 25:08.827
That matchbook lead paid off.

25:08.861 --> 25:10.328
The unit that we put on that bar

25:10.362 --> 25:11.930
spotted Noah Lewis
heading inside.

25:11.964 --> 25:13.364
E.S.U. just took him down.

25:13.399 --> 25:15.151
They found him.

25:18.704 --> 25:20.271
Where's my mother?

25:20.305 --> 25:21.639
Beckett: Being autopsied.

25:21.673 --> 25:22.900
I warned her,

25:22.920 --> 25:25.643
but she wouldn't stop
running her mouth at me.

25:25.677 --> 25:28.287
Now she doesn't say a word.

25:29.698 --> 25:31.482
It's what she deserved.

25:31.517 --> 25:32.650
Well, what about the others?

25:32.684 --> 25:35.053
Did they deserve what they got?

25:35.087 --> 25:37.855
We know what you've done,
Noah...

25:37.889 --> 25:39.754
Who you really are.

25:40.110 --> 25:42.360
Tell us about Emma Malloy.

25:42.577 --> 25:44.795
I'm not good with names.

25:49.404 --> 25:50.701
You know her.

25:50.735 --> 25:52.635
Where were you
the night before last?

25:52.972 --> 25:54.371
- Out.
- Out where?

25:54.405 --> 25:56.152
Neighbors said
your car was gone.

25:56.172 --> 25:59.279
- I took a drive.
- Did you drive to the woods?

25:59.527 --> 26:02.712
What about this girl?
Zoey Addison.

26:02.746 --> 26:05.415
She was seen getting
into your car, Noah.

26:05.450 --> 26:06.816
Now she's gone.

26:06.850 --> 26:08.851
Mm. She's pretty.

26:08.886 --> 26:11.172
Is she dead?

26:11.901 --> 26:13.855
I can't help you.

26:14.414 --> 26:16.926
Where do you take them,
the others?

26:16.961 --> 26:19.013
How do you make them disappear?

26:19.033 --> 26:21.564
We have your car, Noah,
your house.

26:21.599 --> 26:22.932
We will find evidence.

26:22.967 --> 26:25.034
Did Emma find evidence?

26:25.069 --> 26:26.435
Is that why you went after her?

26:26.470 --> 26:27.836
Because she got too close?

26:27.870 --> 26:30.155
Is that why you shot at us?

26:30.175 --> 26:32.238
You were in my house.

26:32.775 --> 26:33.924
[Chuckling] don't you see?

26:33.944 --> 26:36.078
I'm the victim here.

26:36.113 --> 26:37.813
<i>I'm</i> the victim.

26:43.653 --> 26:45.087
Beckett: What's wrong?

26:45.121 --> 26:47.889
Just he's been getting away
with it for 30 years.

26:47.924 --> 26:51.426
I thought he'd be
more... formidable.

26:51.986 --> 26:53.428
We have a problem.

26:53.462 --> 26:55.057
I just spoke with C.S.U.

26:55.077 --> 26:57.105
So far, they haven't found
anything in the house or the car

26:57.125 --> 26:59.300
that links Noah to Emma or Zoey.

26:59.335 --> 27:02.550
So we can't connect him
to either of their murders?

27:02.570 --> 27:03.904
What about his mother's?

27:03.939 --> 27:06.007
Autopsy results indicate that she died
of natural causes.

27:06.041 --> 27:09.515
Right now, all we have this guy
on is mishandling a body.

27:09.535 --> 27:10.565
He shot at us.

27:10.585 --> 27:12.435
Yeah, but he was
hiding in the closet at the time.

27:12.455 --> 27:15.212
He can claim he didn't know
we were cops. He can plead out.

27:15.232 --> 27:17.259
Castle, we can't even link
this guy to Hollander's Woods.

27:17.279 --> 27:19.229
In '83,
he was at a military academy

27:19.249 --> 27:21.091
all the way in south Carolina.

27:21.111 --> 27:22.657
It was presidents' day weekend.

27:22.691 --> 27:24.985
He could have been on vacation
or... or just skipping school.

27:25.005 --> 27:28.010
Except those records are gone,
so there's no way to prove it.

27:28.030 --> 27:31.252
All the jury's gonna hear is that he was
1,000 miles away from New Hampshire.

27:31.272 --> 27:33.966
- Without evidence, we don't have a case.
- Beckett: The key to this is Emma.

27:33.986 --> 27:36.670
We need to place his car in the
area at the time she was attacked.

27:36.704 --> 27:39.201
Let's coordinate with Collins
and set up a canvass up there.

27:39.221 --> 27:40.640
There's got to be
a place he goes...

27:40.675 --> 27:43.121
somewhere out of the way
where he puts the bodies.

27:43.141 --> 27:44.611
You said
that he was seeing a shrink.

27:44.645 --> 27:48.047
Yeah.
A, uh... a Dr. Van Holtzman.

27:48.368 --> 27:50.550
You know, maybe Noah said
something during his sessions

27:50.585 --> 27:51.885
that could help us.

27:51.919 --> 27:53.620
Where do we find Holtzman?

27:53.654 --> 27:55.121
If Noah ends up walking,

27:55.155 --> 27:56.556
you're gonna have
to have <i>me</i> committed.

27:56.591 --> 27:57.691
[Chuckles]

27:57.725 --> 27:58.658
Excuse me.

27:58.693 --> 28:00.660
We need to speak
with Dr. Holtzman, please.

28:00.695 --> 28:03.162
Of course. Just a moment.

28:03.197 --> 28:05.831
Listen, if after seven years
of your crazy theories,

28:05.866 --> 28:07.566
you haven't
already been committed,

28:07.601 --> 28:09.658
then I think you're pretty safe.

28:10.620 --> 28:13.239
Hi. I'm Dr. Holtzman.

28:13.274 --> 28:14.507
I understand
you've been looking for me.

28:14.541 --> 28:15.741
Yeah, I'm detective Beckett.

28:15.776 --> 28:16.742
This is Richard Castle.

28:16.777 --> 28:17.777
We need to speak with you

28:17.811 --> 28:19.812
regarding one
of your patients... Noah Lewis.

28:19.846 --> 28:20.780
Of course.

28:20.814 --> 28:22.715
Let me just finish
with these prescriptions,

28:22.749 --> 28:24.016
and I'll be right with you.

28:24.050 --> 28:25.335
Okay.

28:27.687 --> 28:29.254
Beckett, I know that voice...

28:29.289 --> 28:31.189
from that day
in Hollander's Woods.

28:31.746 --> 28:33.592
It's him. He's the killer.

28:37.254 --> 28:39.536
Castle, that was
over 30 years ago.

28:39.556 --> 28:41.157
- You can't possibly...
- Kate, when he spoke,

28:41.177 --> 28:42.892
I could feel the knife
at my throat.

28:42.926 --> 28:45.027
I will never forget that voice
as long as I live.

28:45.061 --> 28:47.429
[Footsteps approaching]

28:47.464 --> 28:48.987
Sorry about that.

28:49.007 --> 28:51.132
Shall we talk in my office?

28:54.203 --> 28:56.939
Please, have a seat.

28:57.306 --> 28:59.876
I wish I could say
that I was surprised

28:59.910 --> 29:02.285
to hear what Noah had done.

29:02.565 --> 29:03.805
But he was very troubled.

29:03.825 --> 29:06.181
We did everything we could for
him while he was in our care.

29:06.216 --> 29:09.951
Dr. Holtzman, how long have you
been treating Mr. Lewis?

29:09.986 --> 29:11.020
Four years.

29:11.054 --> 29:13.022
We got him stable
after his mother committed him,

29:13.056 --> 29:15.366
but a condition of his release

29:15.386 --> 29:18.092
were state-mandated sessions
every month.

29:18.127 --> 29:20.094
And what did the two of you
talk about?

29:20.129 --> 29:24.966
Anger, intimacy,
his animosity toward women.

29:25.001 --> 29:26.672
You went to Dartmouth.

29:26.692 --> 29:28.817
Yes, for undergrad.

29:30.710 --> 29:32.741
Uh, when was the last time
you saw Mr. Lewis?

29:32.775 --> 29:33.775
A few days ago.

29:33.809 --> 29:35.043
He was quite agitated.

29:35.077 --> 29:37.145
He thought
someone was following him.

29:37.179 --> 29:38.691
I thought
he was just being paranoid,

29:38.711 --> 29:40.180
so I adjusted his meds.

29:40.200 --> 29:43.546
And you had no idea that he was
about to do something violent?

29:43.794 --> 29:45.299
None.

29:45.820 --> 29:47.121
He's done this before, you know.

29:47.156 --> 29:50.124
Abducted women,
killed them in the woods...

29:50.159 --> 29:52.159
possibly for years.

29:52.193 --> 29:53.226
How do you know?

29:53.261 --> 29:54.428
Witnesses.

29:54.462 --> 29:57.544
When he does it,
he wears a mask.

29:57.901 --> 30:01.154
Now, why would he do that...
wear a mask when he kills them?

30:01.174 --> 30:03.815
- I don't know.
- If you had to guess.

30:03.835 --> 30:06.855
What kind of psychosis
would drive a man to do that?

30:06.875 --> 30:09.476
Something terrible
in his childhood?

30:09.496 --> 30:12.946
The mind of a psychopath
is not that simple.

30:12.980 --> 30:15.677
But he kills them anyway.

30:15.697 --> 30:18.485
So why would he need to hide
his face behind this?

30:22.123 --> 30:25.124
Maybe he's not hiding it.

30:26.090 --> 30:29.696
Maybe this is his true face...

30:29.730 --> 30:32.004
The monster
he knows he really is,

30:32.024 --> 30:33.933
and he wants his victims

30:33.968 --> 30:37.014
to see it and fear it
before they die.

30:38.255 --> 30:41.074
Maybe his real mask

30:41.094 --> 30:44.238
is the man he has to pretend
to be every day.

30:47.680 --> 30:48.847
Esposito: His voice?

30:48.881 --> 30:50.842
I know. It sounds crazy.

30:50.862 --> 30:53.018
Because it <i>is,</i> Castle.
We already have a suspect.

30:53.038 --> 30:54.796
Ah, the perfect suspect.

30:54.816 --> 30:56.917
Because Dr. Holtzman
knew intimate details

30:56.937 --> 30:59.554
about his patients,
he set Noah up to take the fall

30:59.574 --> 31:01.660
just in case
anyone got onto the murders.

31:01.694 --> 31:04.162
And Holtzman was
in New Hampshire, at Dartmouth,

31:04.196 --> 31:05.296
in 1983.

31:05.331 --> 31:08.133
He's a family man, married
to his wife for 24 years.

31:08.167 --> 31:10.401
Kids, well-respected,
never been arrested.

31:10.436 --> 31:11.670
And witnesses.

31:11.704 --> 31:14.878
They saw the victim get
into <i>Noah's</i> car, not Holtzman's.

31:14.898 --> 31:18.074
I can't explain that yet, but...

31:18.094 --> 31:21.146
Holtzman is behind this, and...

31:22.513 --> 31:25.883
Babe, the voice... is it
possible you're misremembering?

31:25.917 --> 31:28.186
You've made this killer
your personal bogeyman.

31:28.220 --> 31:29.183
You said so yourself.

31:29.203 --> 31:31.587
You wanted him
to more formidable.

31:31.607 --> 31:33.340
You don't believe me.

31:33.650 --> 31:34.424
He's clean.

31:34.459 --> 31:36.060
He has no connection
to this case.

31:36.094 --> 31:37.427
We've got nothing to go on.

31:37.462 --> 31:38.362
Less than nothing.

31:38.396 --> 31:40.285
All we have
is a 30-year-old voice I.D.

31:40.305 --> 31:43.167
From a witness
who was a kid at the time.

31:43.201 --> 31:45.492
Look, Castle, we want
to solve it as much as you do.

31:45.512 --> 31:47.555
You know what?

31:47.575 --> 31:50.708
I expected this from these guys.

31:51.158 --> 31:52.751
Just not from you.

31:52.771 --> 31:54.811
Castle. [Sighs]

32:20.205 --> 32:22.205
Beckett: I'm sorry.

32:22.239 --> 32:24.773
You said it was him.
I believe you.

32:24.808 --> 32:26.442
Except you're right.

32:26.476 --> 32:28.143
There's nothing we can do.

32:28.163 --> 32:32.114
We'd have to sit on him for
years, hoping he makes a move.

32:32.148 --> 32:34.883
This is not how the story
was supposed to end.

32:34.918 --> 32:37.023
I was thinking.

32:37.302 --> 32:40.155
How did he make those victims
disappear without a trace?

32:40.190 --> 32:42.390
Well, he would have had
to have taken them somewhere.

32:42.425 --> 32:44.226
Somewhere his family
didn't know about.

32:44.260 --> 32:47.930
He'd have to have a lair,
a storage space somewhere.

32:47.964 --> 32:49.264
Too many things could go wrong.

32:49.298 --> 32:51.850
There could be a flood,
a nosy manager.

32:51.870 --> 32:53.268
He would have to find a place

32:53.302 --> 32:55.337
over which he had
absolute control.

32:55.371 --> 32:57.675
So I did a property search.

32:57.695 --> 33:02.189
It came up empty on him,
but I did find this.

33:04.113 --> 33:05.413
- Farmland?
- Yeah.

33:05.448 --> 33:08.149
Owned by Holtzman's parents,
both deceased.

33:08.183 --> 33:09.283
It's in a trust.

33:09.317 --> 33:11.252
Holtzman is listed
as the sole trustee.

33:11.286 --> 33:13.454
It's possible his wife
doesn't know about it.

33:13.488 --> 33:15.957
It's only a few miles from where
Emma was hit by that truck.

33:15.991 --> 33:19.794
Tax records show that there's
a barn on the property.

33:19.828 --> 33:21.495
He must have held her there.

33:21.529 --> 33:23.430
It's private,
in the middle of nowhere.

33:23.465 --> 33:25.299
The perfect lonely place.

33:25.333 --> 33:27.434
Only, I would never get
a warrant.

33:27.469 --> 33:29.052
And if I searched it
without one,

33:29.072 --> 33:31.570
then any evidence I would find
would be inadmissible.

33:31.590 --> 33:33.083
'Cause you're a cop.

33:33.103 --> 33:35.476
But you're not.

33:35.922 --> 33:38.178
It would be trespassing.

33:38.212 --> 33:40.362
You would be breaking the law.

33:40.382 --> 33:42.871
But if you found something...

33:44.019 --> 33:46.019
And I know how much
this means to you,

33:46.053 --> 33:49.036
so whatever you decide,
I will back your play.

33:59.973 --> 34:01.995
Beckett: Looks deserted.

34:02.015 --> 34:02.992
This is the property line.

34:03.012 --> 34:04.311
You should stay back here
on this side.

34:04.331 --> 34:06.234
Okay, but you're
not going in alone.

34:06.247 --> 34:07.213
Keep me on speaker.

34:07.248 --> 34:08.315
Let me know what you find.

34:08.349 --> 34:09.516
Right.

34:26.859 --> 34:28.900
So, what are you seeing?

34:29.527 --> 34:32.004
Looks like he uses it
for storage.

34:32.815 --> 34:35.065
Creepy, creepy storage.

34:40.980 --> 34:43.449
Beckett, it's the same car
that Noah has.

34:43.484 --> 34:45.217
Same color...

34:45.251 --> 34:47.041
Same license plate,
same sticker... everything.

34:47.061 --> 34:48.053
That's how he did it.

34:48.088 --> 34:50.789
So if someone spotted him, it
would lead right back to Noah.

34:50.822 --> 34:53.739
But you're gonna need more
than that to call the police.

34:53.759 --> 34:54.693
Look around.

34:54.726 --> 34:57.736
He may have kept trophies
from his victims.

35:02.434 --> 35:03.724
[Gasps]

35:04.846 --> 35:06.237
You okay?

35:10.803 --> 35:12.308
Yeah.

35:24.605 --> 35:26.057
Oh, God.

35:26.091 --> 35:27.610
Castle?

35:27.630 --> 35:29.957
Castle, what do you see now?

35:31.290 --> 35:32.779
I see them.

35:33.499 --> 35:35.633
Photos of his victims.

35:35.667 --> 35:37.883
I see all of them.

35:47.213 --> 35:49.613
Beckett, he's here. He's inside.

35:49.648 --> 35:51.898
Holtzman: How did you find me?

35:55.434 --> 35:57.187
I've been looking for you
since Hollander's Woods.

35:57.454 --> 35:59.099
The boy.

35:59.119 --> 36:00.990
That was you?

36:01.025 --> 36:03.326
I should have killed you
when I had the chance.

36:03.993 --> 36:06.096
You can't win, Holtzman.

36:06.130 --> 36:07.497
We know who you are.

36:07.532 --> 36:08.898
It doesn't matter.

36:08.918 --> 36:12.331
You'll both be dead,
and they'll never find me.

36:13.804 --> 36:15.060
Castle!

36:15.080 --> 36:16.184
[Pounding on door]

36:16.204 --> 36:17.620
It's locked!

36:22.179 --> 36:23.479
[Grunts]

36:25.496 --> 36:27.383
- Beckett!
- Castle!

36:27.417 --> 36:29.221
I can't get in!

36:31.827 --> 36:34.510
The danger
of facing your demons...

36:35.534 --> 36:38.527
is that sometimes
the demons win.

36:38.562 --> 36:41.262
Castle, what's going on
in there?!

36:42.670 --> 36:44.466
Castle!

36:49.238 --> 36:50.205
Beckett!

36:53.542 --> 36:55.715
[Gunshots]

37:18.634 --> 37:19.700
God!

37:19.735 --> 37:22.503
[Breathing heavily]

37:22.537 --> 37:25.051
Are you okay? You okay?

37:32.419 --> 37:35.600
Reporter: Still more gruesome
discoveries <i>and many more questions</i>

37:35.620 --> 37:39.167
<i>at the rural property of
noted psychologist Van Holtzman</i>

37:39.187 --> 37:40.554
<i>as authorities continue</i>

37:40.588 --> 37:44.090
<i>to find the buried bodies
of his victims.</i>

37:50.831 --> 37:52.761
Thought you were practicing
your speech for tonight.

37:52.781 --> 37:54.235
Oh, yeah. I was.

37:54.255 --> 37:56.577
I just, um...

37:57.011 --> 37:58.279
I couldn't help but wonder...

37:58.299 --> 38:02.998
if it wasn't for him,
for that day in the woods,

38:03.610 --> 38:06.737
would I even be here?
Would we be here?

38:08.893 --> 38:11.918
Babe, we're not here
because of him.

38:12.461 --> 38:16.989
We're here because of who we are
in the face of people like him.

38:17.742 --> 38:19.625
That's why you write mysteries.

38:19.660 --> 38:22.240
That's why I became a cop.

38:22.597 --> 38:25.668
We're both trying to bring
justice to this world.

38:30.926 --> 38:32.404
Now...

38:35.921 --> 38:38.480
I'm gonna go and get dressed

38:38.500 --> 38:42.914
so I can be very proud tonight
of who you are.

38:48.535 --> 38:51.932
Murder, mystery, the macabre...

38:51.952 --> 38:54.625
tonight's honoree
has mastered them all.

38:54.659 --> 38:57.088
For years, he's kept
his readers under his spell

38:57.108 --> 38:59.163
with his electrifying prose.

38:59.198 --> 39:01.799
I'm very proud to present
this year's recipient

39:01.834 --> 39:04.952
of the poe's pen
career achievement award,

39:04.972 --> 39:08.131
my good friend Richard Castle.

39:08.151 --> 39:10.303
[Applause]

39:15.647 --> 39:17.615
Michael Connelly,
ladies and gentlemen.

39:17.649 --> 39:19.356
Thank you very much, Michael.

39:19.376 --> 39:22.786
And my thanks to all of you
for this honor.

39:23.420 --> 39:25.188
You know, I-I...

39:25.223 --> 39:27.531
I've spent
a lot of time the last few days

39:27.551 --> 39:30.044
thinking about how I got here.

39:31.568 --> 39:35.881
The long hours, the blank pages.

39:35.901 --> 39:40.100
Most people think that writing
is a solitary profession,

39:40.120 --> 39:45.144
that we spend our days
in our imaginary worlds...

39:45.164 --> 39:47.766
Fighting, loving, dying.

39:47.786 --> 39:51.318
But we don't do it alone...

39:51.338 --> 39:55.615
Because anything that's good
in our writing comes from truth.

39:55.635 --> 39:57.816
And the truth is,

39:57.836 --> 40:02.158
I'm here because
of the people in my life.

40:02.733 --> 40:03.974
Mother.

40:03.994 --> 40:07.196
You will always be
a star in my eyes.

40:08.783 --> 40:12.508
And, Alexis,
you amaze me every day.

40:12.528 --> 40:16.728
You two are my redheaded pillars
of unconditional love.

40:18.408 --> 40:22.010
To my friends
at the 12th precinct...

40:22.044 --> 40:24.348
You let me in.

40:25.155 --> 40:29.266
Especially you two,
Javier, Kevin.

40:29.286 --> 40:31.251
You've made me
your brother-in-arms,

40:31.271 --> 40:33.688
and I thank you for that.

40:36.122 --> 40:37.425
And Kate.

40:38.629 --> 40:42.662
Seven years ago, I thought
I would never write again.

40:42.682 --> 40:45.423
And then you walked
through the door.

40:45.443 --> 40:48.091
And my whole world changed.

40:48.634 --> 40:52.005
You were right...
you said I had no idea.

40:53.060 --> 40:54.704
But now I do.

40:56.565 --> 41:00.242
This is because of you.

41:01.219 --> 41:03.651
Because of us.

41:04.939 --> 41:06.686
Always.

41:08.656 --> 41:10.694
[Applause]

41:18.888 --> 41:22.518
That was a lovely speech,
darling.

41:22.813 --> 41:25.279
Oh, well, I was inspired.

41:25.673 --> 41:27.306
Esposito: Castle, who's
gonna be your inspiration

41:27.341 --> 41:28.408
if Beckett
becomes state senator?

41:28.442 --> 41:31.168
Yeah, you won't be able
to follow her around anymore.

41:31.188 --> 41:32.083
Oh, I don't know.

41:32.103 --> 41:33.743
Maybe I'll write
a political thriller next.

41:33.763 --> 41:35.415
Ooh, I would so read that.

41:35.449 --> 41:38.706
Beckett, if you do run,
I'll help with your campaign.

41:38.726 --> 41:39.932
Thank you.

41:39.952 --> 41:41.886
That's a pretty big step, Kate.

41:41.906 --> 41:43.590
Have you decided
what you're going to do?

41:43.624 --> 41:45.257
Not yet, but whatever it is,

41:45.292 --> 41:47.293
I'm looking forward
to the adventure.

41:47.327 --> 41:50.296
One thing's for sure...
things are gonna change.

41:50.330 --> 41:53.062
Castle: Well, I know one thing
that will never change...

41:53.745 --> 41:55.761
what we all have.

41:56.503 --> 41:58.371
A toast.

41:58.811 --> 42:00.068
To us.

42:01.960 --> 42:03.642
- To us.
- To us.

42:03.662 --> 42:05.016
Beckett: Cheers.
