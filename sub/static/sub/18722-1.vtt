00:11.020 --> 00:12.700
<i>It's always the same dream</i>

00:13.060 --> 00:14.500
<i>I'm wandering
Naked</i>

00:14.780 --> 00:16.700
<i>In this strange
Maze of hallways</i>

00:17.020 --> 00:20.020
<i>And I feel this creeping sense
Of impending doom</i>

00:20.420 --> 00:22.580
<i>Like something terrible's
About to happen</i>

00:23.820 --> 00:25.300
<i>I pass my roommate</i>

00:25.580 --> 00:26.660
<i>My Mom</i>

00:27.220 --> 00:28.420
<i>My best friend Stella</i>

00:28.740 --> 00:30.540
<i>Basically every significant person in my life</i>

00:30.780 --> 00:32.980
<i>And they're all just staring at me</i>

00:33.340 --> 00:35.580
<i>Like I'm some kind of museum display
Behind glass</i>

00:36.380 --> 00:38.260
<i>Then I see two people
I've never met before</i>

00:39.180 --> 00:41.300
<i>A mysterious unearthly
Beautiful woman</i>

00:42.820 --> 00:44.620
<i>And this red-haired girl</i>

00:44.860 --> 00:47.860
<i>And they both seem to be
Leading me deeper into the corridor</i>

00:49.020 --> 00:50.700
<i>This is when I noticed </ i></i>

00:51.100 --> 00:52.460
<i>A black door</i>

00:53.140 --> 00:54.620
<i>And I'm not sure why</i>

00:54.900 --> 00:57.340
<i>But somehow I know that I've gotta
Find out what's behind it</i>

00:57.700 --> 00:58.860
<i>So I grabbed hold of the knob</i>

00:59.460 --> 01:01.660
<i>Opened the door and discovered</ i></i>

01:02.740 --> 01:03.940
<i>A dumpster</i>

01:05.060 --> 01:07.260
<i>I've had the same bizarre
Fucking dream</i>

01:07.580 --> 01:10.380
<i>Every night since I moved into
The dorms last week</i>

01:11.300 --> 01:13.500
<i>So now I'm wide awake</i>

01:14.620 --> 01:17.580
<i>And, being 18 and perpetually horny</i>

01:17.860 --> 01:19.860
<i>Anytime I have 5 idle minutes</i>

01:20.180 --> 01:23.340
<i>My right hand automatically
Takes over</i>

01:23.700 --> 01:26.180
<i>Like it's got a will of its own</i>

01:44.260 --> 01:46.700
Sorry
I'm just trying to be quiet

01:48.100 --> 01:50.020
It's too hot to sleep anyway

01:52.700 --> 01:53.380
How's the party?

01:54.540 --> 01:55.660
Rad

01:56.540 --> 01:57.260
I'm wasted

01:58.460 --> 01:59.380
Nice

02:10.139 --> 02:12.020
You should've come with us, dude

02:12.860 --> 02:14.060
Everyone got crumped

02:14.980 --> 02:16.700
Took their clothes off

02:17.340 --> 02:18.300
Swam

02:20.020 --> 02:21.740
The water was so warm

02:24.500 --> 02:25.940
Mind if I sit?

02:29.860 --> 02:31.500
Can I ask you something?

02:34.460 --> 02:37.220
Sure
- You're like gay, right?

02:38.140 --> 02:41.020
Uhhh, I'm more
Undeclared

02:42.140 --> 02:43.420
What's it like exactly?

02:44.180 --> 02:47.060
I imagine it's different from
Being with a girl

02:48.180 --> 02:49.300
It's way different

02:51.900 --> 02:52.860
It's more ...

02:54.140 --> 02:55.180
Raw

02:56.740 --> 02:57.780
Physical

02:58.620 --> 03:01.380
I mean, cause you're intimately familiar

03:01.820 --> 03:05.020
With plumbing,
There's less mystery and guesswork

03:06.900 --> 03:09.060
Like,
You know exactly what to do ...

03:10.900 --> 03:12.220
And how it feels

03:12.780 --> 03:15.220
Do you like,
Kiss and stuff?

03:17.540 --> 03:18.580
Of course

03:20.420 --> 03:21.500
I've never ...

03:24.740 --> 03:26.460
Y'know,
Kissed another guy before

03:27.740 --> 03:29.980
Well, it's pretty fucking awesome

03:48.180 --> 03:49.220
My roommate ...

03:52.860 --> 03:53.740
Plough me

03:54.300 --> 03:55.900
Plough me with your monstrous tool!

03:58.020 --> 03:59.020
<i>So, yeah</i>

03:59.340 --> 04:03.380
<i>I have an excruciatingly
Hot, straight roommate</i>

04:04.060 --> 04:05.420
Wassup
I'm Thor

04:05.780 --> 04:07.460
Like the comic
Yup!

04:07.780 --> 04:09.140
<i>And his name really is Thor</i>

04:09.460 --> 04:11.260
<i>As in the superhero
God of Thunder</i>

04:11.580 --> 04:13.220
<i>With the giant hammer</i>

04:13.620 --> 04:15.380
I sleep naked
I hope that doesn't weird you out

04:17.019 --> 04:18.980
<i>It's a perpetual torture</i>

04:21.579 --> 04:23.860
<i>Plus of course he's a surfer,
Dumb as a box of rocks</i>

04:24.100 --> 04:26.460
<i>AKA, exactly my type</i>

04:27.340 --> 04:30.500
I'm like really into Gran Turismo 5

04:30.900 --> 04:33.540
And before that
I was into SOCOM

04:36.020 --> 04:36.980
And oh yeah!
Killzone!

04:37.500 --> 04:39.340
I get with guys sometimes

04:41.580 --> 04:42.340
Sexually I mean

04:42.900 --> 04:44.620
And also, I like to surf

04:45.460 --> 04:46.380
Do you surf, dude?

04:47.020 --> 04:49.220
The guy sounds like a fucking asstard

04:50.020 --> 04:52.260
<i>My partner-in-crime
Stella</i>

04:52.580 --> 04:54.140
<i>Stella and I first met
way back in 9th Grade</i>

04:54.700 --> 04:57.300
I refuse to do this assignment
Cause you're

04:57.620 --> 05:00.180
A sexist loser who has no fucking clue
What you're talking about

05:02.700 --> 05:05.860
Are you sure it's not straight love
Or in love with another oblivious boy fixation?

05:06.220 --> 05:09.580
It's just that I'm not sure
How straight Thor really is

05:09.980 --> 05:12.980
You said he was putting a load
In some pinhead stryer last night

05:13.380 --> 05:16.060
Yeah, but doing it with women
Doesn't necessarily make him straight

05:16.380 --> 05:17.060
Case in point

05:17.580 --> 05:19.900
The fact that you randomly sometimes

05:20.220 --> 05:22.340
Stick it in a girl does not mean anything

05:22.420 --> 05:26.060
Beyond you
Need to monitor your drinking

05:26.740 --> 05:27.340
Here we go

05:27.580 --> 05:28.820
Now he's your typical straight guy, right?

05:29.140 --> 05:31.100
When it comes to sloppiness, and manners

05:31.380 --> 05:33.100
<i>And scratching his balls
In public</i>

05:33.420 --> 05:36.860
Or like eating half a piece of pizza
On someone's coffee table

05:37.220 --> 05:39.180
However, he also does
Stuff like that ...

05:39.900 --> 05:41.420
<i>He wears deodorant every single day</i>

05:41.780 --> 05:43.220
And he exfoliates every night

05:43.500 --> 05:46.300
<i>Religiously, with one of those vibrating
Derma-brasion things</i>

05:46.580 --> 05:47.980
Plus, he's a little too

05:48.220 --> 05:50.620
<i>Into his own body
Like beyond a normal</i>

05:50.940 --> 05:52.940
<i>Straight guy who works out
Admiring his self kinda way</i>

05:53.460 --> 05:54.140
Are we done?

05:54.460 --> 05:56.900
No
I saved the weirdest thing for last

05:57.500 --> 05:59.540
He wears flip flops like
Almost everyday, right?

05:59.900 --> 06:01.820
Very hetero, very dude, choice

06:02.140 --> 06:05.100
Except for the fact
He has a whole collection of them

06:05.460 --> 06:07.180
Which he keeps in a color coordinated row

06:07.980 --> 06:08.900
In his closet

06:10.900 --> 06:13.820
Wow, except from putting a dick in your mouth
With Lady Gaga playing in the background

06:14.180 --> 06:15.460
That's about as gay as it gets

06:15.820 --> 06:16.740
See?
I told you

06:17.140 --> 06:18.380
Smith, I'm kidding

06:18.700 --> 06:20.580
It's all cute and fun
When you're 15

06:21.580 --> 06:23.420
But we're legal adults now

06:23.980 --> 06:25.020
In college

06:25.780 --> 06:26.700
Anyway

06:27.940 --> 06:28.620
I gotta get to class

06:28.900 --> 06:30.540
Me too
Where are you headed?

06:30.820 --> 06:32.260
Imagination Theory

06:32.460 --> 06:35.140
I'm beginning to wonder if being an Art major
in a college of Creative Studies

06:35.500 --> 06:37.860
Is a little too hippy dippy
Even for me

06:38.500 --> 06:39.980
Hey, dudes!

06:41.260 --> 06:42.100
<i>The Messiah</i>

06:42.380 --> 06:45.820
<i>Our pothead RA who is baked 24/7</i>

06:47.140 --> 06:48.100
What's goin' on?

06:48.460 --> 06:50.100
We were just on our way to class

06:50.460 --> 06:51.540
That's cool

06:52.380 --> 06:54.820
I'd a really freaky dream last night

06:55.140 --> 06:56.660
We'd love to hear all about it
But ...

06:56.940 --> 06:59.420
Both of you
Were in it

06:59.820 --> 07:01.060
And the whole world ...

07:01.300 --> 07:03.780
Blew up

07:04.100 --> 07:06.660
In a horrible nuclear catastrophe

07:07.340 --> 07:09.940
Great, thanks Messiah
Goodbye

07:15.180 --> 07:18.100
<i>Majoring in Film Studies
Is something I wanted to do all my life</i>

07:18.820 --> 07:20.900
<i>Eventhough it is a little anachronistic</i>

07:21.140 --> 07:23.660
<i>Considering there is real doubt
As to whether cinema</i>

07:23.980 --> 07:26.460
<i>As we know will even exist
Anymore in the next few years</i>

07:27.340 --> 07:29.220
<i>It's kinda like devoting your life</i>

07:29.460 --> 07:31.540
<i>To studying an animal
That's on the verge of extinction</i>

07:32.580 --> 07:35.500
Smith, college is just an intermission
between high school and the rest of your life

07:35.980 --> 07:37.580
It's 4 years of having sex

07:37.860 --> 07:40.260
Making stupid mistakes
And experiencing stuffs

07:40.900 --> 07:43.540
It's a pitstop
Not the second coming of the Messiah

07:44.460 --> 07:46.980
Speaking of, it was sorta bizarre
What the Messiah was saying this morning

07:48.060 --> 07:49.060
No kidding

07:49.700 --> 07:52.620
What's that guy's deal?
He's gotta be like 30 at least

07:52.980 --> 07:55.620
Yeah I've been having
Weird dreams lately too

07:56.580 --> 07:58.100
What do you think it means?

07:58.380 --> 08:01.500
It's a well-known fact that dreams are just
Your brain taking a dump at the end of the day

08:01.900 --> 08:03.380
It don't mean anything

08:06.700 --> 08:07.780
Hey dude

08:08.260 --> 08:08.940
Let me guess

08:09.500 --> 08:10.820
Thor
Wassup?

08:11.580 --> 08:14.260
Thor, this is my best friend Stella
Stella, Thor

08:15.060 --> 08:16.060
Mind if I join?

08:24.380 --> 08:25.300
Whatcha major in, Stella?

08:26.540 --> 08:27.540
Art

08:27.940 --> 08:29.780
Oh really?
Cool

08:30.460 --> 08:31.380
Yeah
Cool

08:32.659 --> 08:34.380
Are you gay, or whatever too?

08:34.659 --> 08:35.659
Or just like ...

08:36.500 --> 08:37.500
Normal?

08:44.260 --> 08:45.740
Hey, Messiah

08:46.740 --> 08:47.620
Smith!

08:48.100 --> 08:49.500
Got something for you

08:51.740 --> 08:52.580
What is it?

08:53.380 --> 08:55.940
Someone slipped it
Under my door this morning

08:57.140 --> 08:58.420
<i>You Are The Chosen Son</i>

08:58.740 --> 08:59.580
What does it say?

09:04.860 --> 09:05.820
"The Chosen Son?"

09:06.660 --> 09:08.260
What the crap's that supposed to mean?

09:09.380 --> 09:10.820
I have no idea

09:16.620 --> 09:17.860
Oh, hey dude

09:20.100 --> 09:21.340
What are you doing?

09:22.140 --> 09:23.380
What does it look like I'm doing?

09:23.980 --> 09:25.340
Trying to suck your own dick?

09:25.900 --> 09:27.100
Bingo

09:27.380 --> 09:28.860
I've been reading on the Internet

09:29.140 --> 09:31.620
That if you do these
Flexibility exercises twice a day

09:31.980 --> 09:34.260
You'll be able to give yourself
A blowjob in 3 weeks

09:34.620 --> 09:35.460
I'll email you the link

09:35.740 --> 09:37.060
That's ok
- You sure?

09:37.820 --> 09:40.860
It's a useful skill to have, y'know?

09:41.380 --> 09:42.700
In case you hit a dry spell ...
You ever taste your own cum?

09:43.860 --> 09:47.060
Not a whole load, mind you?
But y'know if you

09:47.380 --> 09:48.940
Shoot really hard and some gets
In your mouth by accident

09:49.860 --> 09:51.500
Mine's not bad actually

09:52.140 --> 09:54.140
Kinda vanilla-ish
- Really, can we change the subject?

09:54.860 --> 09:55.500
Oh, bro!

09:56.020 --> 09:57.340
What's it with you and your friend?

09:57.900 --> 09:59.140
Who, Stella?

09:59.460 --> 10:01.140
Yeah, the uptight dyke

10:02.620 --> 10:06.300
Yeah I know she can be a little aloof
When you first meet her, but she's actually

10:06.660 --> 10:10.100
Super hot
In a bitter, edgy les kinda way

10:10.780 --> 10:12.660
You think I have any shot
At hitting that?

10:13.220 --> 10:14.220
I just threw up a little
In my mouth

10:14.540 --> 10:17.300
I know
Hello I'm obsessed with you

10:17.620 --> 10:19.260
And you're into my vagitarian best friend?

10:19.620 --> 10:21.020
It's like I told you
That guy's a toad

10:21.620 --> 10:23.340
I've met plants
With better personalities

10:23.980 --> 10:26.900
And what do you make of him
Trying to blow himself ... this afternoon

10:27.740 --> 10:31.220
He likes having a sword swallowed
Not exactly a revelation

10:32.020 --> 10:33.500
So anyways
The party tonight

10:34.740 --> 10:35.500
You're going

10:35.740 --> 10:38.500
Lorelei, this hot girl from my
Emotion Painting class invited me

10:39.140 --> 10:40.220
Lorelei?

10:40.460 --> 10:44.220
As in legendary siren luring
Helpless sailors to their doom?

10:44.620 --> 10:45.620
Yeah I know

10:45.900 --> 10:48.620
She's gorgeous and I need a wingman
So you're drafted

10:48.940 --> 10:51.300
So that you can hook up
And ditch me after 5 seconds?

10:52.020 --> 10:52.940
Basically

10:55.460 --> 10:57.500
Nice hat by the way
Are we in Paris?

11:00.020 --> 11:02.780
Well, it's about time asshole
- I know

11:03.100 --> 11:05.180
It's been awhile
I'm sorry, I've just been super busy

11:05.740 --> 11:08.260
Don't worry bout it, hon
I work my ass off

11:08.580 --> 11:11.060
Keeping a roof over your head
For the past 18 years

11:11.340 --> 11:12.100
How's college life?

11:13.140 --> 11:14.260
Oh, shit, sweetie

11:15.100 --> 11:17.420
That's Australia on the other line
Can I ring you back in 15?

11:17.780 --> 11:20.860
I'm going to a party with Stella
I'll just call you later this weekend or something

11:21.980 --> 11:22.700
Sure you will

11:29.900 --> 11:31.020
There she is

11:32.100 --> 11:32.860
Lorelei!

11:36.220 --> 11:36.860
That's her?

11:37.140 --> 11:39.180
I know
Effing hot, right?

11:44.140 --> 11:45.460
Smith, Lorelei ...
Lorelei ... this is Smith

11:47.260 --> 11:48.180
Have we met before?

11:49.260 --> 11:50.180
No

11:51.540 --> 11:52.660
I'm sorry, I ...

11:53.140 --> 11:56.340
Anyway ...
Shall we hit the bar?

11:56.740 --> 11:58.020
Definitely

11:58.340 --> 12:00.540
Are you gonna be okay?
- Yeah I'll be fine

13:05.740 --> 13:06.900
Just a minute

13:09.300 --> 13:10.700
Can you hold on?

13:11.020 --> 13:13.740
Can you hurry it up in there
I'm gonna piss like a banshee

13:15.180 --> 13:17.980
Hello, are you giving birth
To a marine in there or what?

13:20.740 --> 13:21.620
Finally!

13:30.660 --> 13:31.940
What happened to your shoe?

13:33.020 --> 13:34.340
A drunk girl barfed on it

13:37.780 --> 13:38.380
Nice hat

13:38.980 --> 13:40.260
Yeah
Same to you

13:45.540 --> 13:46.500
London

13:48.620 --> 13:49.780
Huh?
- I'm London

13:50.220 --> 13:52.940
You don't expect me to shake that hand
Before you wash it

13:53.300 --> 13:54.980
Sorry gay dude

13:55.780 --> 13:56.580
Excuse me?

13:57.020 --> 13:58.300
Well you are, right?

13:58.860 --> 13:59.660
What?

14:00.500 --> 14:01.460
Gay

14:01.940 --> 14:05.140
I don't really believe in
Standardized sexual pejoratives

14:06.100 --> 14:08.580
So you're bi?
- Not exactly

14:09.460 --> 14:13.060
You do it with guys and girls, right?
Depending on which way your Peter points?

14:14.780 --> 14:15.380
It's ...

14:16.740 --> 14:18.140
A little more ...

14:20.500 --> 14:21.780
Complicated

14:22.420 --> 14:24.820
Life doesn't have to be so complicated
Neither does sex

14:27.380 --> 14:28.340
Are you okay?

14:34.980 --> 14:36.220
What was the question again?

14:37.220 --> 14:38.260
Do you wanna fuck?

14:40.260 --> 14:42.980
What?
- Do You Want To Fuck?

14:43.980 --> 14:46.940
I just so happen to find queer guys hot
So my thing

14:48.620 --> 14:50.460
Dude, keep it simple

14:50.980 --> 14:52.660
You, me, intercourse

14:53.340 --> 14:54.260
Yes, no?

14:56.100 --> 14:57.700
What?!
I'll drive

14:59.300 --> 15:00.100
What are you doing?

15:01.740 --> 15:02.300
What do you think?

15:02.860 --> 15:05.260
Maybe We should wait
Till we get back to your place

15:05.580 --> 15:06.260
Why?

15:06.460 --> 15:09.540
It's kinda dangerous
I mean I'm trying drive here

15:10.780 --> 15:12.220
I live with danger

15:16.740 --> 15:17.900
Me too

15:23.140 --> 15:23.860
I'm gonna cum

15:24.340 --> 15:27.260
Do it, do it
Just let me do it more

15:37.140 --> 15:38.380
Did you cum too?

15:41.780 --> 15:44.740
No, it's kinda hard for me
In that position

15:45.140 --> 15:47.540
But it was really cool watching you

15:47.860 --> 15:49.540
Wait
You didn't cum?

15:51.860 --> 15:53.380
Whatever, I'm good

15:54.180 --> 15:55.980
What kinda guy are you?

15:56.220 --> 15:59.860
If I didn't just have your dick inside of me
I swear you didn't have one

16:02.380 --> 16:04.340
I got this kinda weird thing

16:05.460 --> 16:08.780
Where I'm really into making
Whoever I'm with, cum

16:09.620 --> 16:11.900
Now that
Really turns me on

16:14.780 --> 16:18.140
I happen to take pride
In being scandalously great in bed

16:18.500 --> 16:21.100
So if you think you're going
Home without cumming

16:21.380 --> 16:22.380
Forget it

16:35.860 --> 16:36.900
Ahh, feels so good!

16:45.219 --> 16:46.219
Oh God ...!

16:46.220 --> 16:47.040
Wait

16:47.900 --> 16:49.020
Don't cum yet

16:49.300 --> 16:50.780
I want to show you something

16:50.781 --> 16:51.781
What?

16:54.020 --> 16:55.940
Just lay back, and relax
- Alright

16:59.020 --> 17:00.140
Are you ready?

17:07.579 --> 17:10.859
You're not even touching me
But it's like I can feel your mouth on my ...

17:11.220 --> 17:12.339
Cool, huh?

17:13.819 --> 17:15.099
How do you do that?

17:15.420 --> 17:17.060
I have special talents

17:18.460 --> 17:19.579
What do you mean?

18:08.140 --> 18:09.780
That was so hot

18:10.980 --> 18:13.900
I almost came again
Just watching you

18:16.180 --> 18:18.660
Don't get any ideas
OrgasMomatic

18:19.340 --> 18:20.900
I gotta get some sleep

18:24.140 --> 18:25.500
What are you doing?

18:26.980 --> 18:28.460
No offence dude ...

18:30.420 --> 18:33.660
I'm really not into the whole ...

18:34.460 --> 18:35.780
Sleepover breakfast thing

18:39.460 --> 18:40.540
Here, gimme your number

18:54.460 --> 18:55.620
So ...

18:56.460 --> 18:57.180
See you?

19:20.180 --> 19:22.220
Help! They're coming!
They're coming to get me!

19:22.780 --> 19:26.040
Please! We gotta get outta here!
Come on!

20:10.580 --> 20:12.660
Wow
Talking bout a bad trip

20:13.620 --> 20:14.660
What kinda drugs were you on anyway?

20:15.300 --> 20:16.860
That's just it
I'm not sure

20:17.460 --> 20:19.580
It was so vivid
And real

20:20.980 --> 20:23.380
<i>I must have blacked out or something cause
When I woke up</i>

20:23.740 --> 20:27.100
<i>I don't know how much later
The animal-masked men, the red-haired girl</i>

20:27.500 --> 20:28.900
<i>They were nowhere to be found</i>

20:29.220 --> 20:30.260
<i>Smith, you were hallucinating</i>

20:31.020 --> 20:34.180
I can't believe I let you drag me out of
A very sexy dyke's bed for this

20:34.500 --> 20:37.340
That's the other thing,
How do you explain me seeing Lorelei in a dream

20:37.700 --> 20:38.860
Before I even met her

20:39.500 --> 20:42.460
Could be because there's more Lorelei
Than meets the eye

20:42.740 --> 20:43.740
What do you mean?

20:45.420 --> 20:46.580
She's a witch

20:47.860 --> 20:49.220
A ... what?

20:49.860 --> 20:51.060
She's a witch

20:51.300 --> 20:53.900
Y'know ...
Supernatural powers, casts spells

20:55.980 --> 20:57.940
I know
Pretty cool, huh?

22:10.420 --> 22:11.980
Dude, we've been searching
All morning and found

22:12.500 --> 22:14.460
No footprints, no blood, zilch
- I know

22:15.780 --> 22:17.460
And now you wanna spend the rest of the day

22:17.780 --> 22:19.900
Poring over the entire student population
In the campus directory?

22:20.220 --> 22:21.660
You got something better to do?

22:23.060 --> 22:25.500
Sucking a fart
Out of a dead seagull's ass?

22:35.500 --> 22:36.860
Stella! Stella!
- I'm awake

22:37.940 --> 22:39.100
100% awake

22:40.540 --> 22:41.460
Come here

22:48.500 --> 22:49.620
Are you sure that's her?

22:54.580 --> 22:55.780
So what do we do now?

22:58.780 --> 23:01.580
Start calling every O'Hara
In the phonebook I guess?

23:02.240 --> 23:04.040
And ...
Say what?

23:04.360 --> 23:07.640
"Hi. I was tripping balls last night
And you were in my dream"

23:12.200 --> 23:14.400
What are you doing here?
- I came to rescue you

23:14.960 --> 23:15.960
Oh my God,
Awesome

23:16.240 --> 23:17.120
Smith ...

23:17.640 --> 23:19.200
Go ahead
Bail

23:28.100 --> 23:31.060
Hi, I was lookin' for a Madeleine O'Hara ...
Is there ...

23:33.060 --> 23:34.740
Okay, sorry to bother you
Thank you

23:43.580 --> 23:44.860
What are you doing?

23:45.780 --> 23:46.340
Who is this?

23:46.820 --> 23:48.180
The girl you fucked last night

23:52.060 --> 23:53.700
Hi, sorry ...
- I repeat, what are you doing?

23:54.660 --> 23:56.900
I was kinda in the middle of something
Right now

23:57.460 --> 23:59.140
I'm stressed about this exam
I have on Monday

23:59.460 --> 24:00.260
I was thinking

24:00.500 --> 24:02.260
I could really use a good orgasm

24:04.500 --> 24:05.380
Thanks

24:05.900 --> 24:07.220
I needed that

24:10.100 --> 24:11.100
What?

24:13.100 --> 24:14.020
Nothing

24:17.020 --> 24:18.740
I just, I just think you ...

24:20.940 --> 24:21.820
Cool

24:25.220 --> 24:26.820
Yeah?
You're cool too

24:32.460 --> 24:33.700
Now where are you going?

24:33.980 --> 24:36.340
I told you
I have a massive test Monday

24:36.700 --> 24:38.340
And I'm still here

24:39.940 --> 24:41.820
So that's it
We both cum and you leave?

24:42.420 --> 24:44.820
Pretty much
Is there a problem?

24:49.740 --> 24:51.260
Eventhough we just met

24:52.500 --> 24:53.740
I feel ...

24:54.620 --> 24:56.780
This weirdly intense connection with you

24:57.580 --> 24:59.460
I know
Me too

25:00.540 --> 25:02.100
Sure you can't stay
A little bit longer?

25:03.220 --> 25:04.620
Is that you ...

25:05.460 --> 25:07.140
Or Smith junior talking?

25:09.940 --> 25:10.500
Both

25:11.100 --> 25:14.180
As much as I love to help
The two of you out

25:14.660 --> 25:15.700
I gots to study

25:20.460 --> 25:21.060
What's this?

25:22.180 --> 25:23.860
Last night after I left your place

25:24.180 --> 25:26.220
I was walking out
By the lagoon and

25:27.500 --> 25:28.300
What?

25:29.540 --> 25:30.860
I know her

25:33.220 --> 25:34.100
What?

25:34.540 --> 25:35.460
I know her
Know her

25:36.020 --> 25:37.300
She was in my Sociology class

25:38.020 --> 25:40.180
She was always strung out
Totally fucked up

25:40.460 --> 25:43.180
Last week
she passed out in the middle of a lecture

25:44.500 --> 25:45.860
And what happened?

25:46.100 --> 25:47.780
Paramedics came and took her away

25:49.460 --> 25:50.540
Well, last night

25:50.780 --> 25:52.780
I had this insanely intense

25:53.420 --> 25:56.300
Vision of her getting murdered

25:56.660 --> 25:58.820
By 3 guys in animal masks

25:59.420 --> 26:01.060
Did you say animal masks?

26:04.220 --> 26:04.780
Why?

26:06.860 --> 26:07.540
Oh, sorry

26:08.220 --> 26:08.980
You guys boning?

26:09.780 --> 26:11.340
I was just leaving

26:15.300 --> 26:16.420
I'll call you

26:21.780 --> 26:22.780
Hi

26:24.020 --> 26:26.300
Errr ... can you move your
Fat ass out of my way?

26:29.300 --> 26:30.340
Thanks

26:30.780 --> 26:32.820
I'm Thor
By the way

26:33.260 --> 26:34.740
Yeah I'm sure you are

26:40.260 --> 26:40.940
Who was that?

26:45.020 --> 26:46.500
Wow
I think that broke my all-time record

26:47.100 --> 26:48.580
You tired already?

26:49.060 --> 26:51.300
We've been going at it
For 5 hours

26:51.580 --> 26:53.540
I mean I love sex
As much as anyone else

26:53.860 --> 26:56.500
But if I cum anymore tonight
My crude is just gonna break

26:57.300 --> 26:59.260
But I wanna make love again

27:00.420 --> 27:01.660
You're kidding, right?

27:02.460 --> 27:05.460
What are you?
Some kind of insatiable sex maniac?

27:10.740 --> 27:12.300
Too bad, I'm beat

27:13.020 --> 27:14.220
Buzzkill

27:18.460 --> 27:19.420
What was that?

27:19.700 --> 27:21.460
What
What are you talking about?

27:21.980 --> 27:24.660
I felt that Lorelei
I know what you're doing, it's not ...

27:32.300 --> 27:33.740
Hello
- Smith, what are you doing?

27:34.420 --> 27:35.740
Walking home from the library

27:36.020 --> 27:37.020
Why?
What's wrong?

27:37.260 --> 27:38.140
You gotta rescue me

27:38.420 --> 27:40.780
It turns out Lorelei is a little bit crazy
Like a shithouse rat

27:41.300 --> 27:43.540
I told you
There was something scary about her

27:43.980 --> 27:46.140
Look I'm gonna make up
An excuse about you

27:46.500 --> 27:48.220
Having some kinda crisis
That I'll meet you back at your place

27:50.420 --> 27:52.620
Stella, what?
What's going on?

27:52.980 --> 27:53.780
She walked on

27:55.500 --> 27:56.780
Stella ...
Stella are you in there?

27:57.180 --> 27:58.340
I'm just peeing

27:58.700 --> 27:59.980
What's taking so long?

28:00.260 --> 28:01.180
I miss you

28:02.020 --> 28:03.500
Be out in a sec

28:04.660 --> 28:05.500
I gotta go ...
- Wait, Stel

28:11.860 --> 28:12.380
Shit

28:32.180 --> 28:32.820
Shit!

28:34.980 --> 28:36.780
Help!
Somebody help!

28:38.500 --> 28:39.540
Smith?
What's wrong?

28:46.500 --> 28:47.420
The door

28:49.460 --> 28:50.260
It was stuck

28:50.660 --> 28:51.820
Are you alright, man?

28:53.780 --> 28:55.620
Yeah ...
I'm fine

29:08.540 --> 29:09.540
Who's there?

29:09.780 --> 29:11.900
The Queen of fucking England
Who do you think?

29:14.340 --> 29:15.180
Get in!

29:17.740 --> 29:18.900
Whatthe ...?
- Just come here quick

29:19.220 --> 29:20.340
What?
- Look!

29:21.580 --> 29:23.900
Yeah that's a beautiful parking lot Smith

29:26.940 --> 29:27.940
They were just down there

29:28.220 --> 29:29.540
Who?
What are you talking about?

29:29.780 --> 29:31.020
The animal masks men

29:31.740 --> 29:33.380
You mean the ones you hallucinated?

29:33.700 --> 29:34.820
I'm not hallucinating now

29:35.780 --> 29:38.420
I think that something really
Fucking freaky is going on

29:42.660 --> 29:44.100
Oh, sorry
Were you two ...

29:44.420 --> 29:45.220
Gross!
No

29:45.700 --> 29:47.380
You must be Smith's new girlfriend

29:49.060 --> 29:50.580
Huh?
- She's kidding

29:51.460 --> 29:53.340
Madeleine O'Hara, the red-haired girl ...

29:53.660 --> 29:56.620
London says she was in her Sociology class
And then went missing about a week ago

29:57.340 --> 29:59.340
Well that's why I came by

29:59.780 --> 30:00.860
She may have turned up

30:02.180 --> 30:02.820
What do you mean?

30:03.060 --> 30:05.300
Is Oceanography, that building past

30:05.580 --> 30:07.020
Madigan Hall
Way out on the west side of campus

30:07.260 --> 30:08.460
Right by the lagoon?

30:09.860 --> 30:10.820
I don't know
What's going on?

30:11.580 --> 30:13.260
It could just be a coincidence

30:13.540 --> 30:15.820
But I was studying tonight
In the library

30:16.180 --> 30:17.500
And there on the floor

30:17.940 --> 30:19.020
I saw this ...

30:19.260 --> 30:22.260
<i>Unidentified Headless Female Torso Found
In Oceanography Department Dumpster </i>

30:26.020 --> 30:26.940
<i>Days passed</i>

30:27.220 --> 30:30.980
<i>I searched the news religiously but
There was no word on the body in the dumpster</i>

30:31.340 --> 30:34.220
<i>I started to wonder
If maybe I really was losing my mind</i>

30:35.100 --> 30:37.740
<i>To clear my head
I went to this nude beach</i>

30:38.060 --> 30:39.500
<i>A few miles from campus</i>

30:39.980 --> 30:41.780
<i>I've never been to
One before in my life</i>

30:42.060 --> 30:44.420
<i>So one morning before class
I checked it out</i>

30:45.020 --> 30:47.260
<i>I gotta say
It was a little nerve-wracking</i>

30:47.540 --> 30:49.540
<i>But kinda liberating</i>

30:49.820 --> 30:53.340
<i>Lying there with the sun, and the breeze
The smell of the ocean</i>

30:53.940 --> 30:56.260
<i>All my worries
All the weird shit going on</i>

30:56.580 --> 30:58.420
<i>Everything melted away</i>

30:59.780 --> 31:00.860
<i>But then ...</ i></i>

31:11.780 --> 31:12.900
How's it goin'?

31:19.260 --> 31:20.260
Mind if I join you?

31:29.340 --> 31:29.940
Hunter

31:31.500 --> 31:31.980
Smith

31:33.060 --> 31:33.940
You come here often?

31:35.260 --> 31:36.420
This is my first time

31:37.300 --> 31:39.140
I didn't think I'd seen ya around

31:44.780 --> 31:45.820
You in school?

31:47.060 --> 31:48.980
Yeah. You?
- Fuck, no

31:49.500 --> 31:50.580
I build and design hot tubs

31:52.020 --> 31:53.180
Oh really?

31:56.220 --> 31:57.060
Wait ...

32:00.300 --> 32:02.260
Do you like
Do this a lot?

32:02.540 --> 32:03.700
What do you mean?

32:05.780 --> 32:06.580
This ...

32:17.020 --> 32:18.340
Oh, hey dude!

32:18.980 --> 32:21.100
What's going on?
- Teaching this fag a lesson

32:21.420 --> 32:22.380
Yeah, who's teaching who yeah fag?

32:24.020 --> 32:26.300
Smith, this is my best bud Rex
Rex, Smith

32:26.860 --> 32:27.820
Wassup, man

32:29.260 --> 32:31.540
Well
I was just gonna grab a shower

32:31.940 --> 32:35.260
Alright hey man, if you want it you should try
Some of that awesome new conditioner I just got

32:35.580 --> 32:37.100
It's the one on my sofa
With the French name

32:37.660 --> 32:39.940
Listen to yourself
You sound like a huge fucking fag!

32:40.260 --> 32:43.380
Ok fag, that's it!
I'm kicking your giant homo ass!

32:44.460 --> 32:45.220
Who's the fag now huh?

32:45.740 --> 32:47.180
You, faggot fag steak!

32:48.020 --> 32:49.900
What's that?
- Fag burger with a side of fag fries

32:50.220 --> 32:51.220
Yeah ...
I'm just gonna ...

32:53.460 --> 32:55.180
You meet some guy on the nude beach

32:55.500 --> 32:58.500
And 5 minutes later, you're downloading
his hard drive in the back of a van?

32:59.300 --> 32:59.940
You're a slut

33:01.700 --> 33:02.420
Really?

33:04.420 --> 33:06.100
So did you dump Lorelei yet?

33:06.700 --> 33:09.580
I'm trying to pull away
But she's not exactly making it easy

33:10.020 --> 33:11.100
You're not inviting me in?

33:11.820 --> 33:14.580
I'm kinda tired
And I have a super early class tomorrow

33:15.420 --> 33:16.580
Is something wrong?

33:17.780 --> 33:19.660
No, I'm just tired

33:28.180 --> 33:29.500
Aren't you gonna kiss me goodnight?

33:32.060 --> 33:32.620
Uhmmm ...
Sure

33:39.420 --> 33:40.220
Well, ummm ...
Goodnight

33:44.100 --> 33:45.100
I love you

33:47.260 --> 33:48.620
Yeah ...
Me too

33:48.940 --> 33:51.820
I know I have to end it
But my experience with psychopaths

33:52.180 --> 33:54.460
Like her
You have to ease away very gradually

33:55.300 --> 33:57.780
The sooner the better
Before she pulls something really nutty

34:01.660 --> 34:04.580
I told you nothing's wrong
I just gotta finish this project

34:04.940 --> 34:06.620
You're not avoiding me
Are you?

34:06.940 --> 34:08.060
Of course not

34:08.780 --> 34:10.739
If you're lying
That would make me very upset

34:13.060 --> 34:14.780
I'm not lying babe

34:16.060 --> 34:18.260
Look, I need to get back to work

34:18.580 --> 34:19.620
I'll call you tomorrow, alright?

34:19.860 --> 34:21.219
What time tomorrow?

34:22.380 --> 34:23.699
After class

34:24.540 --> 34:25.860
I'll be counting the minutes

34:27.820 --> 34:29.100
Okay
- I love you

34:29.739 --> 34:30.620
Me too

34:31.260 --> 34:32.300
Goodnight

34:55.580 --> 34:56.500
<i>Hi, Smith </i>

34:56.780 --> 34:59.460
<i>I hope you don't think
This is too creepy stalker of me</i>

34:59.780 --> 35:03.140
<i>But I'm too much of a social retard to
Walk up and say Hi like a normal person</i>

35:03.620 --> 35:04.780
<i>In case you're wondering</i>

35:05.060 --> 35:08.660
<i>I got your e-mail from the
Explosions in the Sky's Facebook page</i>

35:09.300 --> 35:10.980
<i>So at least
We have this much in common</i>

35:11.900 --> 35:14.860
<i>Anyways I was wondering
If you maybe wanna get together</i>

35:15.220 --> 35:16.340
<i>Have coffee or something</ i></i>

35:16.860 --> 35:17.780
<i>If not, then uh ...</ i></i>

35:19.260 --> 35:20.900
<i>Have a great life I guess</i>

35:21.420 --> 35:25.380
<i>Okay, I'm gonna stop now before
I chicken out and toss this in the trash</i>

35:26.540 --> 35:28.340
<i>Yeah, I'm Oliver
By the way</i>

36:20.140 --> 36:21.380
So I've been meaning to ask

36:21.660 --> 36:24.900
The other day when I mentioned
The animal masks guys

36:25.260 --> 36:27.100
You seemed kinda weirded out

36:27.380 --> 36:28.340
It seems appropriate

36:28.620 --> 36:30.180
It's a weird story

36:34.940 --> 36:36.020
Is it your Mom?

36:37.660 --> 36:38.140
How did ...

36:38.460 --> 36:39.620
Your face

36:41.780 --> 36:43.860
My Mom's okay
She did the best she could

36:44.180 --> 36:46.100
Raising me on her own ...
Working full-time

36:47.060 --> 36:48.180
What about your Dad?

36:48.700 --> 36:50.460
He died in a car accident
When I was a baby

36:50.780 --> 36:51.460
I'm sorry

36:52.180 --> 36:54.660
I never knew him so it's kinda like
I don't even have a father

36:55.260 --> 36:57.540
I don't see my Dad either
He was an alcoholic

36:57.820 --> 36:59.580
Abandoned us when I was little

37:00.780 --> 37:02.740
I guess we have more in common
Than we thought

37:05.100 --> 37:06.460
What are you looking at now?

37:06.820 --> 37:08.380
It's just my roommate's friend

37:09.260 --> 37:10.820
Smith's got a crush!

37:11.700 --> 37:13.380
I do not have a crush

37:14.260 --> 37:17.900
You're hooked for him like you're
Hooked for that shaved egg roommate of yours

37:18.820 --> 37:21.460
When I walked in
They were both rolling around

37:22.420 --> 37:23.900
On the floor
Wrestling in their underwear

37:24.420 --> 37:27.860
Straight guys are gayer than gay guys
The fact that they're in love but can't

37:28.260 --> 37:30.060
Suck each other's dick
Makes them queerer than Clay Aiken

37:33.340 --> 37:34.580
What ...
What are you doing?

37:34.820 --> 37:36.260
I inviting him over

37:36.740 --> 37:38.100
Chillax
Just having some fun

37:39.780 --> 37:40.700
Here he comes

37:42.499 --> 37:43.499
Hey

37:43.500 --> 37:45.180
Rex, this is my friend London
London, Rex

37:46.180 --> 37:47.900
You look lonesome
Want some company?

37:49.959 --> 37:50.959
Sure
Thanks

37:52.660 --> 37:54.460
We were just talking about sex

37:55.140 --> 37:56.260
She's kidding

37:56.820 --> 37:59.540
So Rex,
Have you ever heard of the Kinsey scale?

38:01.060 --> 38:03.100
It's a rating system
For sexual orientation

38:03.380 --> 38:06.540
0, being totally hetero
And 6, 100% gay

38:07.220 --> 38:10.420
Smith here is probably a 3 or 4

38:10.780 --> 38:12.260
While I'm like a 1.5

38:12.580 --> 38:14.340
Why don't we talk about something else?

38:14.620 --> 38:18.020
Kinsey discovered that only 5 to
10% of the population are at 6 or 0

38:18.740 --> 38:20.540
What do you think your number is?

38:22.220 --> 38:23.340
Zero I guess ... ?

38:23.620 --> 38:24.700
Boring

38:25.900 --> 38:26.860
You wanna fuck anyway?

38:29.260 --> 38:30.340
Are you out of your fucking mind?

38:30.660 --> 38:32.380
Dude don't worry
I'll give you the 4-1-1 after

38:33.781 --> 38:34.981
Okay

38:35.539 --> 38:36.539
Excuse me?

38:36.540 --> 38:37.660
Let's have sex

38:38.460 --> 38:39.700
Just with you, though
Right?

38:43.140 --> 38:44.700
Yeah, that's it!

38:46.100 --> 38:47.780
Oh don't stop
You're doing great!

38:56.460 --> 38:57.660
Are you joking?

38:59.180 --> 39:01.780
Sorry
- I've had pelvic exams last longer than that

39:03.180 --> 39:05.060
It's just ...
You felt so good

39:05.940 --> 39:07.540
What are you, 14?
Wow!

39:11.380 --> 39:12.940
I'll be hard again in a few

39:13.260 --> 39:15.300
And it lasts way longer
The second time around, I swear

39:15.660 --> 39:16.940
Oh joy!

39:17.780 --> 39:20.100
In the meantime
I'll eat your pussy or something

39:20.900 --> 39:23.020
This just keeps getting
Better and better doesn't it?

39:24.380 --> 39:25.940
C'mon
Let me make it up to you

39:32.660 --> 39:36.260
Yeah that's it, baby
I just want to make you feel good

39:55.260 --> 39:57.340
What the hell's going on down there?

39:57.900 --> 40:00.340
What do you think you're doing?
- Eating you out

40:00.940 --> 40:02.940
Dude, it's a vagina
not a bowl of spaghetti

40:06.140 --> 40:07.180
I don't know
What your fucking problem is

40:07.420 --> 40:10.140
But I've gone down on lots of girls
And never had any complaints

40:10.740 --> 40:14.140
Maybe they're faking it to
Spare your fragile male ego?

40:16.420 --> 40:17.900
Look, you want a few
Constructive pointers?

40:18.420 --> 40:20.020
I don't need pointers

40:20.580 --> 40:22.660
Trust, you so do

40:23.740 --> 40:25.220
And you know what a clit is, right?

40:25.500 --> 40:26.580
Yeah
I know what a clit is

40:27.180 --> 40:29.620
Think of it as a little girl dick

40:29.940 --> 40:31.380
And treat it accordingly
Imagine what your dick likes

40:31.740 --> 40:33.020
Kiss it, tease it with your tongue

40:33.260 --> 40:34.740
Suck it, even nibble it a little

40:35.220 --> 40:38.140
Just make sure you true-to-God
Treat it with the utmost care and respect

40:38.700 --> 40:41.980
Which brings us to the number one
Golden rule of oral

40:42.340 --> 40:44.180
Pay attention to how she's reacting

40:44.420 --> 40:46.140
If she seems into something

40:46.380 --> 40:48.300
Keep doing that same thing
Over and over and over

40:48.620 --> 40:52.420
It's about finding the rhythm she likes
And sticking to it until the job is done

40:53.620 --> 40:54.580
Got it

40:54.820 --> 40:56.420
You want a practical?

41:00.660 --> 41:01.380
So ready

41:04.420 --> 41:06.180
Well, get busy son

41:18.340 --> 41:19.860
Hey
- So we hooking up or what?

41:20.220 --> 41:21.380
Excuse me?

41:21.820 --> 41:24.660
I thought maybe you might wanna have sex so that
You can do Rex via the transfer property

41:25.260 --> 41:28.860
If A fucks B, and B fucks C
It's like A fucks C by default

41:29.980 --> 41:33.260
As appealing as you make that sound
I'll pass

41:33.660 --> 41:34.660
You're not curious?

41:34.940 --> 41:36.100
About ...

41:36.340 --> 41:38.180
What Rex is like in bed

41:42.779 --> 41:43.779
Oh hey
-Hey

41:43.780 --> 41:46.500
I just came by to pick up some stuff

41:47.340 --> 41:48.660
Is everything alright?

41:50.780 --> 41:51.740
Yeah
Totally

41:53.060 --> 41:53.940
Well late

41:54.340 --> 41:55.220
See ya

41:58.300 --> 42:00.580
What was that about?
- I don't know, got me

42:03.820 --> 42:04.340
What is it?

42:04.820 --> 42:07.700
I set a Google Alert
For any news of the dead girl in the dumpster

42:08.220 --> 42:10.420
Did they finally identify her?
- Maybe

42:12.421 --> 42:13.421
What?

42:14.980 --> 42:17.220
It's gone
- What's gone?

42:18.100 --> 42:19.420
The torso

42:20.540 --> 42:22.340
Someone stole it
From the coroner's office

42:54.100 --> 42:55.580
<i>Today's the day</i>

42:56.340 --> 42:58.060
<i>My 19th birthday</i>

42:59.140 --> 43:01.940
<i>My morning starts out
Like any other</i>

43:02.460 --> 43:05.180
<i>But very quickly
Weirdness takes over</i>

43:06.060 --> 43:07.900
And now what begins?
- The hell if I know

43:08.220 --> 43:10.580
It's just freaking me out
Because the minute I woke up

43:11.260 --> 43:12.220
I was overwhelmed by this vague sense

43:12.420 --> 43:14.900
That some sort of
Major shift has occurred

43:15.420 --> 43:17.620
Well I finally did break up with Lorelei
this morning

43:17.900 --> 43:19.220
Yeah
How did that go?

43:23.420 --> 43:25.340
Yikes
Then what happened?

43:25.660 --> 43:26.820
This isn't over Stella

43:27.260 --> 43:30.100
You have no fucking idea
What you're getting yourself into

43:32.060 --> 43:33.420
So are you worried?

43:33.780 --> 43:35.820
Does Mel Gibson hate Jews?

43:36.340 --> 43:38.380
Anyway, let's change the subject

43:38.780 --> 43:40.860
Any word yet from what's-his-name?

43:41.220 --> 43:42.340
Oswald?
- Oliver

43:43.900 --> 43:46.820
No, I spent literally hours
honing my reply of a masterpiece

43:47.180 --> 43:50.020
That's definitely interested but
Not too desperate for this

43:50.340 --> 43:51.740
How long's it been?

43:52.180 --> 43:53.100
Three days

43:54.100 --> 43:54.660
I know

43:56.100 --> 43:57.300
So, don't forget

43:57.620 --> 43:59.980
We're seeing Helen Stellar
Tonight over in Ocean City

44:00.260 --> 44:00.940
That's right!

44:04.780 --> 44:05.620
Fuck me!

44:09.460 --> 44:10.140
Smith!
What happened?

44:10.460 --> 44:12.020
Smith stepped into dog shit

44:12.260 --> 44:13.780
And it's his birthday

44:14.060 --> 44:15.060
Happy fucking birthday!

44:15.660 --> 44:16.940
Could this day get any worse?

44:20.059 --> 44:21.159
Hello?
- Smith?

44:22.460 --> 44:24.260
Hi, who is this?

44:24.860 --> 44:25.580
Hunter

44:25.820 --> 44:26.540
Who?

44:27.660 --> 44:28.780
Hunter
From the beach?

44:30.420 --> 44:32.900
Oh hi, sorry
I didn't recognize your voice

44:33.860 --> 44:36.020
That's okay
Just playing back

44:36.300 --> 44:37.940
In my mind the good time we had

44:38.420 --> 44:39.500
Started getting a chub
Just thinking about it

44:42.540 --> 44:44.940
So, I'm sure you have an important class
Or something to go to?

44:45.260 --> 44:47.620
I'm totally free all afternoon

44:48.100 --> 44:49.460
Sweet
Wanna come down?

44:49.940 --> 44:51.340
I'm on my way

44:53.780 --> 44:54.660
<i>I'll fuck you</i>

44:59.900 --> 45:00.780
Just a second!

45:04.780 --> 45:05.780
Hold on!

45:10.099 --> 45:11.099
Hey!

45:11.100 --> 45:13.860
Dude, you don't have to hide your porn
I'm not your Mom

45:14.180 --> 45:15.020
What do you mean?

45:15.420 --> 45:18.660
Like you think the unmistakable sound of gay porn
Doesn't penetrate these walls?

45:20.780 --> 45:22.420
Alright, biatch

45:23.140 --> 45:24.540
You made your point

45:25.180 --> 45:27.620
So I gather your tawdry hook-up
At the beach was a bust?

45:28.300 --> 45:31.860
His cell went just when
He was going down on me

45:33.140 --> 45:34.060
It's my wife

45:34.860 --> 45:36.900
You're married?
- Yeah, I thought I told you

45:37.220 --> 45:40.100
Gotta run, we'll take care
Of this guy later

45:41.100 --> 45:42.020
Can you believe it?

45:42.620 --> 45:43.740
Since it's you
Yes

45:45.260 --> 45:47.700
Anyway ...
Happy Birthday monkey-spanker

45:48.060 --> 45:50.780
What's this? You already got me
The Helen Stellar tickets

45:51.140 --> 45:52.860
Shut up and open it already

45:58.940 --> 45:59.700
Oh my God ...
How did you ...

45:59.900 --> 46:03.020
I contacted them through their website
and they autographed it for me

46:03.780 --> 46:06.220
This is so awesome
Thank you

46:11.100 --> 46:12.460
What are you doing right now?

46:14.140 --> 46:15.860
Uhmm, I'm just
Talking to Stella

46:16.180 --> 46:17.700
Can you meet me in my room
In 20 minutes?

46:17.980 --> 46:20.340
I have a birthday surprise for you

46:21.780 --> 46:24.540
This is making me a little uncomfortable

46:24.860 --> 46:27.780
Do you want your surprise
Or do you want to complain?

46:28.300 --> 46:29.700
I'm not complaining

46:29.940 --> 46:33.020
I really appreciate the effort
But ...

46:39.099 --> 46:39.999
London?

46:43.100 --> 46:45.580
London, c'mon
This isn't funny

46:46.300 --> 46:48.260
Chill pill
I'm right here

46:50.940 --> 46:52.940
Can you please take
The blindfold off?

46:54.220 --> 46:55.780
Seriously, you've had enough fun for ...

47:27.220 --> 47:28.300
Happy birthday

48:45.620 --> 48:47.180
So epic

48:47.460 --> 48:49.860
I know, I'm not gonna
Be able to hear for a week

48:50.460 --> 48:52.220
I must admit after a shaky start

48:52.460 --> 48:54.540
This may be the best birthday ever

48:56.819 --> 48:57.819
Smith?

48:57.820 --> 48:59.060
I thought that was you

49:00.900 --> 49:02.020
Hey
It's Oliver

49:05.100 --> 49:06.620
Well, I'm just ...

49:07.740 --> 49:09.780
Uh huh
I'll meet you back at the car

49:11.780 --> 49:12.780
So ...

49:14.300 --> 49:16.300
I just wanted to say ...

49:17.700 --> 49:18.900
Eat shit and kill yourself

49:22.020 --> 49:24.780
Wait, what the fuck is that?
You're pissed at me?

49:25.260 --> 49:27.820
Just next time someone puts
Their balls on the line like that

49:28.260 --> 49:29.740
At least be man enough to respond!

49:30.060 --> 49:32.540
I did respond, I sent an email
That was so long

49:33.260 --> 49:35.260
And overbaked I thought I scared you off

49:36.100 --> 49:38.540
Dude, I'm already over it

49:38.820 --> 49:39.660
You don't have to lie

49:39.940 --> 49:42.620
I'm not lying, I did want to go out with you
I still do

49:44.660 --> 49:47.380
Are you fucking with me now?

49:47.820 --> 49:48.620
No

49:48.980 --> 49:51.860
Just let me take you to dinner
And I'll prove it

49:53.260 --> 49:55.980
Here, so we don't have
To rely on emails

49:56.300 --> 49:57.700
Gimme your number
And I'll give you mine

49:58.700 --> 50:01.500
I have a huge paper due Friday

50:02.940 --> 50:05.740
But that night
I'm totally open

50:06.700 --> 50:07.740
Me too

50:08.660 --> 50:09.420
Cool

50:10.460 --> 50:12.140
So
It's a date

50:13.780 --> 50:15.100
You aren't gonna ...

50:15.660 --> 50:16.700
Flake again, are ya?

50:17.340 --> 50:18.780
I'm calling you
No matter what

50:19.260 --> 50:20.700
Even if the world ends

50:26.940 --> 50:30.140
I better get back to my friends
They're probably wondering what happened to me

50:30.141 --> 50:31.141
Alright

50:41.700 --> 50:42.620
See ya

50:49.060 --> 50:50.700
So should I call him?

50:50.701 --> 50:51.701
What?

50:51.980 --> 50:55.740
Should I give Oliver a call, just to say
"Hi, it was nice running into you"

50:56.140 --> 50:59.180
Good idea, let him know you're a need-ball freak
Right off the bat

50:59.940 --> 51:00.900
Really?

51:01.460 --> 51:05.300
Smith, the universe is finally smiling on you
And everything is going your way

51:05.700 --> 51:09.120
Don't fuck it up
- Yeah right, okay

51:10.980 --> 51:14.140
Can you pull over at the next stop
I haveta pee like a pregnant woman

51:53.299 --> 51:54.299
Hello?

52:32.000 --> 52:32.880
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!

52:33.080 --> 52:34.480
I didn't mean to

52:37.120 --> 52:38.360
Are you alright?

52:41.479 --> 52:42.479
Yeah

52:44.480 --> 52:46.200
I was just dozed off

52:48.440 --> 52:50.080
Do you remember me?

52:52.600 --> 52:54.600
I think we've met before

52:55.400 --> 52:56.480
At a party

52:57.520 --> 53:00.200
I've never seen you before
In my life

53:00.840 --> 53:02.760
You barfed on my shoe

53:03.680 --> 53:04.680
And later that night

53:05.160 --> 53:07.760
I saw three men
In animal masks ...

53:08.080 --> 53:09.760
I don't know what you're talking about

53:10.760 --> 53:11.320
Are you sure?

53:11.520 --> 53:13.840
Look
I told you ...

53:15.360 --> 53:16.680
I don't know anything

53:18.680 --> 53:19.600
Please
I gotta go

53:19.840 --> 53:20.960
Madeleine?

53:24.390 --> 53:25.950
Madeleine O'Hara

53:27.310 --> 53:29.470
What do you know
About the animal-masked men?

53:32.470 --> 53:33.150
You gotta tell me

53:45.790 --> 53:47.630
I had a twin sister

53:48.470 --> 53:50.150
Named Rebecca

53:52.870 --> 53:54.550
And when we were little ...

53:58.430 --> 54:02.030
Men in animal masks
Came and took her away

54:10.070 --> 54:12.430
Dude, you already googled Rebecca O'Hara

54:12.750 --> 54:15.110
On your BlackBerry
And got a million hits of nothing

54:15.670 --> 54:16.630
Deal with it tomorrow

54:20.550 --> 54:23.870
You're right. Let's just try to enjoy
Whatever's left of my birthday

54:24.750 --> 54:26.510
So how does it feel to be 19?

54:31.270 --> 54:32.190
Now what is it?

54:33.350 --> 54:34.670
Nothing
I'm just tired

54:36.190 --> 54:39.550
So, any more crazy messages
From Lorelei?

54:40.430 --> 54:43.430
Well, seems to have died down a little
So that's promising

54:45.310 --> 54:48.030
Who knows
Maybe I was over-reacting

54:48.310 --> 54:51.310
I mean I know how hell hath no fury and all
But could be, she's

54:51.710 --> 54:52.950
Not as bonkers as we thought

55:00.630 --> 55:02.230
Stella
What's wrong?

55:14.710 --> 55:17.230
I don't know, do you think
Maybe I'm being too much of a wimp?

55:17.990 --> 55:20.870
Dude, you have a Fatal Attraction stalker

55:21.190 --> 55:22.790
With supernatural powers
You've got every right to be creeped out

55:23.310 --> 55:24.630
Yeah, okay
Sold

55:25.470 --> 55:27.390
I'm gonna give you the bed, lady

55:27.990 --> 55:29.110
You want an Ambien?
- No

55:29.350 --> 55:32.630
Thank you. After the day we've had
Don't think I'm gonna have any trouble falling asleep

55:32.990 --> 55:36.550
Me neither, but I wanna be so knocked out
I don't want how many more gnarly nightmares

55:43.270 --> 55:44.510
So where's Board Knight?

55:45.270 --> 55:47.750
He disappears sometimes
For a few days

55:48.190 --> 55:51.510
I assume he's off somewhere
Burying his bone in some ...

55:54.910 --> 55:57.190
Smith c'mon
That's not funny

55:59.910 --> 56:01.710
Smith, I'm not kidding
Cut it out

56:06.630 --> 56:08.590
Smith, what the fuck
You're freaking me out, stop it

56:11.230 --> 56:12.630
It's not Smith

56:13.230 --> 56:15.550
Smith, stop fucking around

56:21.150 --> 56:23.470
Stella, I told you

56:25.070 --> 56:26.190
It's not Smith

56:31.830 --> 56:33.030
I warned you Stella

56:35.230 --> 56:37.310
I warned you not to do this

56:38.070 --> 56:40.030
Fuck you, Lorelei

56:40.390 --> 56:41.590
This isn't real

56:41.910 --> 56:44.350
This isn't really happening
- Oh it's happening alright

56:46.110 --> 56:47.430
Believe me ...

56:48.110 --> 56:48.910
It's happening

56:49.190 --> 56:51.070
I'm dreaming
I must be dreaming

56:51.350 --> 56:52.830
Wake up!
Wake up, c'mon ...!

56:52.831 --> 56:55.831
Wake up ...!

57:03.710 --> 57:06.150
<i>Till Death Do Us Part</i>

57:15.430 --> 57:17.950
Lorelei!
I know you're out there!

57:18.270 --> 57:21.990
Stop hiding and show your fucking face
You fucking coward!

57:23.790 --> 57:27.190
Fuck you, you crazy bitch!
You hear me? Fuck you ...

57:27.191 --> 57:29.191
Fuck you!

59:04.870 --> 59:07.310
Holy fucking shit!

59:28.030 --> 59:29.270
Why are you ...

59:30.710 --> 59:32.390
I was up all night
I didn't sleep at all

59:33.310 --> 59:34.710
Smith, what's going on?

59:35.270 --> 59:37.510
I woke up
In the middle of the night ...

59:40.030 --> 59:41.670
And I found this IM

59:42.670 --> 59:44.070
Telling me to go to this address

59:47.270 --> 59:49.390
You ever heard of the New Order?

59:50.510 --> 59:53.150
The seminal New Wave band from the 80s?

59:54.870 --> 59:55.910
No
Here, I'll show you

59:56.590 --> 59:59.070
It's like this secret underground cult

01:00:02.670 --> 01:00:03.470
What?

01:00:03.750 --> 01:00:05.670
The address
It's not in my browser history

01:00:06.550 --> 01:00:09.030
Are you sure you weren't just
Having some kinda sugar-induced nightmare?

01:00:09.310 --> 01:00:10.710
Stella, I'm not making this up

01:00:13.870 --> 01:00:16.430
It's gone, all of it
The site, the IMs

01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:19.030
Stel, I'm not crazy
I was on this site

01:00:19.670 --> 01:00:21.190
It had a list

01:00:21.870 --> 01:00:24.070
Of all these ostracized members

01:00:25.270 --> 01:00:27.070
Number 1 on the list was ...

01:00:29.310 --> 01:00:31.350
Her name was Rebecca Novak

01:00:32.110 --> 01:00:34.630
Rebecca, as in the name of
The red-haired girl's twin

01:00:35.190 --> 01:00:37.150
So why does she have a different
Last name?

01:00:37.470 --> 01:00:39.150
I don't know
Maybe she was adopted or something

01:00:39.430 --> 01:00:40.550
Anyway ...

01:00:41.830 --> 01:00:43.030
That Rebecca girl

01:00:43.790 --> 01:00:45.950
she had this whole litany of transgressions

01:00:46.270 --> 01:00:48.110
Blasphemy, sedition, treason

01:00:48.430 --> 01:00:49.630
And her penance

01:00:53.790 --> 01:00:54.950
Was death

01:00:56.830 --> 01:00:59.390
And there's something else
Even weirder

01:01:05.150 --> 01:01:08.350
On the website, they had a photo
Of the cult's leader

01:01:08.790 --> 01:01:10.150
Like their L. Ron Hubbard
The whole thing

01:01:10.630 --> 01:01:12.350
The Supreme One

01:01:12.670 --> 01:01:14.190
And he looked like ...

01:01:16.750 --> 01:01:17.870
My Dad

01:01:18.670 --> 01:01:21.110
What the fuck are you talking about
Your Dad is dead

01:01:22.830 --> 01:01:25.150
I found this in the trash
When I was little

01:01:25.430 --> 01:01:26.910
I always kept it a secret

01:01:28.990 --> 01:01:31.830
The guy on the website
That's him

01:01:32.430 --> 01:01:33.590
I know it

01:01:35.230 --> 01:01:37.950
Oh Milo ...
It hurts so good

01:01:42.830 --> 01:01:44.990
Tight session
You were really in the zone today

01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:48.750
I had a lot of tension to work out
- I could tell

01:01:49.190 --> 01:01:51.030
So is there anything else
I can do for you?

01:01:51.630 --> 01:01:53.750
Well for starters
You can get out of those fucking clothes

01:02:01.590 --> 01:02:02.230
Now what?

01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:04.750
Oh I've got a few ideas

01:02:08.390 --> 01:02:11.390
And they're absolutely
Filthy

01:02:15.230 --> 01:02:16.190
Oh oh
Hold that

01:02:18.830 --> 01:02:19.590
Hello?
- Mom?

01:02:21.710 --> 01:02:25.190
Smith, I'm in the middle of a meeting
Can I call you right back?

01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:27.920
It's kinda important
It's about Dad

01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:30.080
What about him?

01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:32.880
I just got a couple of questions
- Alright

01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:37.960
He died when I was a baby, right?

01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:41.200
Yeah, in a car accident
You know all this already, what's going on?

01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:43.800
Mom, I just have to know
Is there anything you're not telling me?

01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:47.360
No, there is not
This chapter of our life has been closed

01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:48.720
For a long time

01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:50.440
What was Dad's last name?

01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:52.400
Did he go by any other aliases?

01:02:53.790 --> 01:02:55.390
Smith, look
I'm hanging up now okay?

01:02:55.910 --> 01:02:57.870
Stop asking questions about your father

01:02:58.150 --> 01:02:59.150
For your own good

01:02:59.390 --> 01:03:00.350
Mom, wait ...

01:03:58.590 --> 01:03:59.430
London?

01:04:00.630 --> 01:04:02.030
My Dad's alive?

01:04:02.790 --> 01:04:04.950
He got his PhD in psychology

01:04:05.310 --> 01:04:06.910
His research focused on an obscure

01:04:07.230 --> 01:04:09.830
Community of hippies
Devoted to this book ...

01:04:10.150 --> 01:04:11.470
An Ideal for Living

01:04:12.270 --> 01:04:15.710
Your father spent years studying the techniques
That leaders use to control the group

01:04:16.310 --> 01:04:19.030
In the early 90s,
he took the cult head for himself

01:04:19.350 --> 01:04:20.630
How do you know all this?

01:04:24.110 --> 01:04:27.350
My father wasn't an alcoholic
He was in the cult too

01:04:28.510 --> 01:04:31.710
Ever since I can remember
My Dad would disappear

01:04:32.350 --> 01:04:35.110
Then one night
When I was around 10

01:04:38.270 --> 01:04:39.750
We never saw him again

01:04:40.790 --> 01:04:42.750
And what does all this
Have to do with me?

01:04:43.270 --> 01:04:45.990
You're the first-born male child
Of the Supreme One

01:04:46.910 --> 01:04:48.030
The Chosen Son

01:04:49.550 --> 01:04:50.190
What about you?

01:04:50.830 --> 01:04:53.310
Did you know who I was
All this time?

01:04:55.070 --> 01:04:57.550
So that night we met
At the party

01:04:57.870 --> 01:04:59.270
I was following you

01:04:59.670 --> 01:05:02.150
But only because I was hoping
You might be able to lead me to my father

01:05:03.270 --> 01:05:05.950
But our friendship,
Everything that's happened since then

01:05:07.150 --> 01:05:08.590
None of that was planned

01:05:09.710 --> 01:05:11.150
You believe me, don't you?

01:05:13.150 --> 01:05:15.110
I'm not sure what I believe in anymore

01:05:28.630 --> 01:05:29.470
Messiah!

01:05:32.470 --> 01:05:33.550
The end ...

01:05:35.190 --> 01:05:37.230
The end is near

01:05:50.289 --> 01:05:51.689
Hello?

01:06:51.990 --> 01:06:54.590
So you're saying, her body just
Vanished into thin air

01:06:55.350 --> 01:06:59.350
It was the freakiest fucking thing
One minute I'm checking her for a pulse ...

01:06:59.430 --> 01:07:01.270
She seems dead
Cold as stone

01:07:01.550 --> 01:07:04.750
So I run out to grab my cell to call 9-1-1

01:07:05.150 --> 01:07:07.430
And by the time I got back
I swear it was like 10 seconds later

01:07:07.790 --> 01:07:08.910
She's gone

01:07:09.270 --> 01:07:11.910
I know it sounds nuttier
Than squirrel shit

01:07:14.710 --> 01:07:16.790
Well, strange seems to be
The new normal lately

01:07:17.430 --> 01:07:18.750
What about Messiah?

01:07:19.030 --> 01:07:20.990
Did the doctors say
He was just tripping or what?

01:07:21.270 --> 01:07:23.830
His pupils were like
Big black suns

01:07:24.230 --> 01:07:26.070
They're running a bunch of tests

01:07:31.709 --> 01:07:32.709
Smith?

01:07:32.710 --> 01:07:34.270
Mom
What is it, what's wrong?

01:07:35.590 --> 01:07:37.910
I need you to drop whatever you're doing
And come home immediately

01:07:38.790 --> 01:07:40.030
What ...
What are you talking about?

01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:41.990
I can't say anything more

01:07:42.590 --> 01:07:43.830
They're probably listening to us
Right now

01:07:44.270 --> 01:07:45.470
Who's listening?

01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:49.550
Mom, are you in some kinda danger?
Maybe you should call the police

01:07:50.830 --> 01:07:53.710
No, no police, they can't be trusted
They're part of it

01:07:53.990 --> 01:07:55.110
Look, no more questions okay?

01:07:55.390 --> 01:07:57.230
Just get in your car
And come home

01:07:58.070 --> 01:07:59.510
Smith, I'm not kidding

01:07:59.830 --> 01:08:01.550
Do it
Now!

01:08:10.790 --> 01:08:13.950
Smith, don't worry I'm sure your Mom
Will explain everything when we get there

01:08:18.510 --> 01:08:19.870
I just can't stop thinking about

01:08:20.430 --> 01:08:21.910
What the Messiah said

01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:24.590
You mean all that
"End is Near" shit?

01:08:25.870 --> 01:08:27.950
Stella, I have the exact same feeling

01:08:29.430 --> 01:08:32.270
And it keeps getting progressively
More and more intense

01:08:34.430 --> 01:08:34.990
Like ...

01:08:35.670 --> 01:08:38.910
What if this really
Is the beginning ...

01:08:39.950 --> 01:08:40.630
Of the end?

01:08:51.749 --> 01:08:52.749
Hello

01:08:52.750 --> 01:08:53.750
Smith, where are you?

01:08:54.109 --> 01:08:56.189
Dude, me and Stella are driving
To L.A. for the night

01:08:56.550 --> 01:08:58.189
Actually it's a family emergency

01:08:58.510 --> 01:08:59.670
Is everything okay?

01:09:00.390 --> 01:09:02.630
Hope so
What's going on?

01:09:03.029 --> 01:09:05.550
Well, I just called the hospital

01:09:05.990 --> 01:09:07.029
The Messiah's gone

01:09:08.830 --> 01:09:11.630
How could someone who's barely even conscious
Just up and disappear?

01:09:12.270 --> 01:09:14.029
Nobody knows what happened to him

01:09:14.350 --> 01:09:15.830
That's not the only thing

01:09:17.131 --> 01:09:18.031
What?

01:09:19.390 --> 01:09:21.950
The results of his toxicology
Report came back

01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:25.670
They discovered traces of dioxin
in his bloodstream

01:09:26.590 --> 01:09:27.790
Dioxin?

01:09:28.069 --> 01:09:30.109
You mean,
Like that Russian spy dude?

01:09:30.750 --> 01:09:33.229
Yeah
The Messiah was poisoned

01:09:39.149 --> 01:09:40.270
Are you sure
You're gonna be alright?

01:09:40.750 --> 01:09:43.550
It's just I don't know how my Mom's gonna
React and it might be touchy feely family ...

01:09:43.870 --> 01:09:45.390
Don't worry about me

01:09:45.710 --> 01:09:48.069
Just call or text whenever
The coast is clear

01:09:49.710 --> 01:09:50.950
Thanks Stel

01:09:52.109 --> 01:09:53.149
For everything

01:09:54.710 --> 01:09:56.710
Smith, everything's gonna be fine

01:10:06.030 --> 01:10:07.030
Mom?

01:10:12.031 --> 01:10:13.131
Hello?

01:10:49.230 --> 01:10:50.310
Smith, you alright?

01:10:51.470 --> 01:10:52.550
Come on, let's get outta here!

01:10:54.630 --> 01:10:55.790
Smith, hurry up!

01:10:56.190 --> 01:10:56.990
What are you doing?
What is it?

01:11:05.310 --> 01:11:07.310
London?
Smith, I was just about to call you

01:11:07.710 --> 01:11:09.430
There's something really weird going on

01:11:09.710 --> 01:11:10.790
What do you mean?

01:11:11.670 --> 01:11:15.910
All the highest-ranking members of
The New Order seem to be heading out of town

01:11:16.750 --> 01:11:18.030
It's a mass migration

01:11:18.870 --> 01:11:20.230
We're heading back now

01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:21.910
Listen

01:11:22.910 --> 01:11:24.790
I have something major to tell you

01:11:25.510 --> 01:11:27.150
I think my Mom's been kidnapped

01:11:28.710 --> 01:11:31.670
What?
- She's missing and we found her Blackberry

01:11:32.510 --> 01:11:35.230
And there's all this information on it

01:11:36.110 --> 01:11:37.630
What kind of information?

01:11:37.990 --> 01:11:41.310
A bunch of incriminating documents about
My Dad and the New Order

01:11:42.950 --> 01:11:44.950
It's so much huger
Than just some sick little cult

01:11:45.230 --> 01:11:47.190
It's like this whole secret society and

01:11:47.510 --> 01:11:50.710
Infiltrating the media, government
Even the police are involved

01:11:51.910 --> 01:11:53.470
But look, that's not all

01:11:54.230 --> 01:11:56.230
My Dad had dozens of wives

01:11:56.510 --> 01:12:00.150
Like he basically slept with
Anyone in the cult he wanted

01:12:00.710 --> 01:12:03.390
As a result, he has all these
Illegitimate children

01:12:04.350 --> 01:12:06.350
And he's your biological father

01:12:06.830 --> 01:12:08.190
And you're my half-sister

01:12:12.389 --> 01:12:13.389
London

01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:15.790
London, are you still there?

01:12:17.790 --> 01:12:19.150
I'm here Smith

01:12:19.990 --> 01:12:22.510
Look, you just need to get back here
Soon ...

01:12:25.749 --> 01:12:26.749
London?

01:12:26.750 --> 01:12:28.510
London, what's going on?
What's happening?

01:12:29.511 --> 01:12:31.511
London ...

01:12:42.590 --> 01:12:43.830
London
Open up!

01:12:45.030 --> 01:12:45.950
Fuck!

01:12:46.430 --> 01:12:48.110
This always works on my room

01:12:53.350 --> 01:12:56.270
First The Messiah, then my Mom, now London
What's fucking next!

01:12:56.590 --> 01:12:57.750
What are you gonna do?

01:12:58.830 --> 01:13:02.190
We gotta get outta here, just pack some stuffs
In a bag, I'll meet you in your room in like 5 minutes

01:13:02.590 --> 01:13:04.430
What?
- Stel, just do it!

01:13:04.750 --> 01:13:06.790
Five minutes, hurry
And watch your back!

01:13:36.390 --> 01:13:38.270
Mom, what happened
Who did this to you?

01:13:53.110 --> 01:13:54.590
What are you waiting for?
We don't have all night

01:13:54.830 --> 01:13:56.670
Blow me, fag
Who made you queen for the day?

01:13:56.990 --> 01:13:58.590
Dudes, seriously

01:13:59.150 --> 01:14:01.150
This is no time for dicking around

01:14:14.151 --> 01:14:17.351
Smith?
Smith?

01:14:23.470 --> 01:14:25.510
Messiah?
Jesus, you gave me a freakin' heart attack

01:14:25.950 --> 01:14:27.830
Stella, there's no time to explain
Where is Smith?

01:14:28.110 --> 01:14:29.630
I think he's been kidnapped

01:14:30.350 --> 01:14:31.830
Fuck!
- Messiah, what the shit is going on?

01:14:32.070 --> 01:14:32.990
Come with me
I'll explain on the way

01:14:33.430 --> 01:14:34.710
On the way where?
What are you talking about?

01:14:34.990 --> 01:14:37.510
Stella, we may already be too late
Just come on

01:14:42.710 --> 01:14:44.070
Welcome back, dude

01:14:49.150 --> 01:14:50.430
What is this?

01:14:51.110 --> 01:14:51.950
Finally!

01:14:52.270 --> 01:14:53.750
The Chosen Son awakes

01:14:54.470 --> 01:14:56.710
Can someone please tell me
What the fuck is happening?

01:14:57.230 --> 01:14:58.390
It's Day Zero

01:14:59.110 --> 01:15:00.310
What the hell is Day Zero?

01:15:00.630 --> 01:15:03.030
It's New Order codespeak
For the day the world ends

01:15:04.230 --> 01:15:07.830
Dude I'm sure you heard it before
But you gotta cut way back on your weed intake

01:15:08.190 --> 01:15:09.390
As a matter of fact ...

01:15:10.510 --> 01:15:11.790
I've never touched that stuff

01:15:12.590 --> 01:15:14.390
The stoner thing was just a front

01:15:14.750 --> 01:15:18.030
I'm actually part of a covert group
Operation called The Resistance

01:15:18.870 --> 01:15:22.390
And it's our mission, to wipe out
The New Order once and for all

01:15:22.510 --> 01:15:23.350
Oliver?

01:15:23.590 --> 01:15:26.510
So lemme get this straight
You guys are both ex-members

01:15:26.870 --> 01:15:28.750
Of the New Order who are
Now like spies trying to destroy it?

01:15:29.350 --> 01:15:31.830
In grossly simplified terms
Yes

01:15:33.090 --> 01:15:35.090
My girlfriend Rebecca
Is also in the movement

01:15:35.730 --> 01:15:36.450
Rebecca Novak?

01:15:36.770 --> 01:15:37.730
The red-haired girl

01:15:38.090 --> 01:15:39.290
She's your girlfriend?

01:15:39.970 --> 01:15:40.970
She was

01:15:41.610 --> 01:15:43.090
Before she was murdered

01:15:43.930 --> 01:15:47.170
The cult performs secret initiations
Involving underage girls

01:15:47.490 --> 01:15:50.730
Who are either abducted or donated
By their fucked up parents

01:15:51.370 --> 01:15:54.050
Rebecca was working undercover
Videotaping the rituals for the FBI

01:15:54.370 --> 01:15:57.450
Smith saw that video
It was on the USB drive he said got stolen

01:15:58.290 --> 01:16:01.010
We suspect Thor and Rex are responsible for that
- Thor?

01:16:02.130 --> 01:16:02.930
And Rex?

01:16:03.330 --> 01:16:05.650
So all 3 of you have been
Spying on me this whole time?

01:16:05.970 --> 01:16:08.690
Dude, you're the Chosen Son

01:16:09.050 --> 01:16:11.730
We have to monitor and report
Your every move

01:16:12.130 --> 01:16:12.770
Hers too

01:16:17.490 --> 01:16:18.690
Where are you taking us now?

01:16:19.970 --> 01:16:20.690
Go ahead, tell him

01:16:21.490 --> 01:16:22.450
Tell me what?

01:16:22.890 --> 01:16:24.050
We're taking you
To meet your father

01:16:43.710 --> 01:16:45.590
Where are they Oliver?
Do you see them?

01:16:48.670 --> 01:16:51.590
Yeah, I got them
They're heading east on I-10

01:16:53.690 --> 01:16:56.170
You're some kinda witch too?
Like Lorelei?

01:16:56.610 --> 01:16:59.450
The New Order tests all its members'
Offspring for the "gift"

01:17:00.130 --> 01:17:02.650
A certain type of brain activity
indicating a predisposition

01:17:03.010 --> 01:17:04.290
For paranormal ability

01:17:04.850 --> 01:17:06.330
Subjects displaying a high level
Of this marker

01:17:06.730 --> 01:17:10.250
Are inducted into a program with
Intensive psychotropic treatment

01:17:10.650 --> 01:17:11.570
To cultivate those skills

01:17:12.330 --> 01:17:13.570
And that's what happened to you?

01:17:14.010 --> 01:17:14.770
And Lorelei?

01:17:15.010 --> 01:17:17.130
Some come out of the program
Severely damaged

01:17:17.330 --> 01:17:19.370
With a laundry list
Of personality disorders

01:17:19.900 --> 01:17:20.820
Others don't make it at all

01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:23.840
Smith's gift is exceptionally strong

01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:25.560
Smith has psychic powers too?

01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:28.520
They're just dormant
Like seeds that haven't germinated

01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:30.320
Now that he's turned 19

01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:32.960
It looks like the Prophecy
Is coming true

01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:33.960
What's the Prophecy?

01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:36.400
It's based on a recurring dream
Of your father's

01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:39.880
The Chosen Son will return to the fold
In its 19th year

01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:41.360
And the world as we know it

01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:43.760
Will be destroyed in a nuclear holocaust

01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:44.800
You're shitting me

01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:49.040
The New Order has warheads
Strategically planted in every major city in the world

01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:51.760
World War 3 can be started
With the push of a button

01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:54.600
But won't they obliterate
Themselves in the process?

01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:57.600
The cult has a massive underground lair
Called the Secret Sanctum

01:17:58.420 --> 01:18:00.620
Specially designed to survive
A nuclear disaster

01:18:00.900 --> 01:18:02.140
So after the great Apocalypse

01:18:02.340 --> 01:18:03.940
The New Order will be all that's left

01:18:04.140 --> 01:18:07.180
When the Prophecy transpires
You'll inherit the Kingdom

01:18:07.420 --> 01:18:09.220
You're gonna be like
The Prince of the new fucking world

01:18:10.140 --> 01:18:12.140
Well if that's true
Why am I tied up

01:18:12.780 --> 01:18:15.100
Why do London and my Mom
Have their mouths taped?

01:18:15.509 --> 01:18:18.539
Sorry, man
We're just following orders

01:18:18.940 --> 01:18:20.180
Though I guess now that we're out

01:18:20.190 --> 01:18:23.560
In the middle of nowhere
It's probably okay to let them get some air

01:18:24.740 --> 01:18:25.740
What do you guys think?

01:18:25.940 --> 01:18:29.260
Why not?
But if either of them mouth off I reserve the right

01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:31.940
To plug their face - whole
With my cock

01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:37.460
Don't worry

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:41.700
I'll do it nice, and slow

01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:44.100
So it won't hurt

01:18:44.380 --> 01:18:47.510
Thanks, arse hat

01:18:47.511 --> 01:18:48.511
No problemo

01:18:52.980 --> 01:18:55.780
Grab her, fucking douche!
- I'm trying!

01:18:57.380 --> 01:18:58.640
Look, is that them?

01:18:59.660 --> 01:19:02.340
That van belongs to a Level 4
Night Assignment Smith

01:19:02.900 --> 01:19:03.940
So, yes

01:19:04.420 --> 01:19:05.960
Well then
What the Jesus are you waiting for?

01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:07.820
Floor it!

01:19:10.420 --> 01:19:11.560
Who's the girl now?

01:19:16.500 --> 01:19:18.290
What the fuck's wrong
With you pussies?

01:19:18.780 --> 01:19:21.860
Jesus!
She's a fucking girl!

01:19:22.561 --> 01:19:24.861
Dude, come on!
Get her!

01:19:28.700 --> 01:19:30.780
What the ...

01:19:30.781 --> 01:19:31.781
Pull over!

01:19:32.482 --> 01:19:34.982
Kiss my fucking starfish
Homo!

01:19:56.780 --> 01:19:58.320
What are you doing?

01:19:58.421 --> 01:19:59.421
Hang on!

01:20:02.479 --> 01:20:03.479
Are you fucking kidding?!

01:20:04.180 --> 01:20:05.990
You couldn't pick a smoother road?

01:20:11.281 --> 01:20:12.381
What the hell?

01:20:13.282 --> 01:20:14.202
Look out!

01:20:15.305 --> 01:20:21.630
