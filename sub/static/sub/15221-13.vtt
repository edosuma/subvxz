Follow me.
We can't go in there, remember?

She feels dirty from all the smoke
and lust in the air.

06:10.803 --> 06:14.762
So she takes a warm bath...
to wash off the shame.

06:16.709 --> 06:19.644

from the other room.

Why is he hurting her?

06:30.256 --> 06:32.190

06:33.626 --> 06:36.094
He's screaming and clawing at her.

rip her apart,

That's just psychic ability.

09:38.711 --> 09:40.645
It's perfectly natural.

As natural as Ouija boards

San Francisco for 25 years.

of a bizarre serial murderer
in Chinatown.

This is weird.
Hmm?

Uh, calling Dylan
and tipping him to the killings.

10:49.782 --> 10:53.912
That's weird. And they're all
strippers and hookers.

10:53.986 --> 10:56.079
At least until now.

Two weeks.

Two weeks?

to catching the killer,
and he came after her.

Well, if she's psychic, how come
she doesn't know that she's gonna die?
I don't know.

I remember reading somewhere
that- that psychics...

You saw what she went through?

13:28.407 --> 13:31.035

13:32.945 --> 13:35.914
Sometimes, by touching
a person's things,

13:35.981 --> 13:39.382
it triggers certain feelings
and... visions.
