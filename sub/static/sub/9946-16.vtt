00:06.963 --> 00:14.380
Come and watch pikeys making a mess of the
lives they were given by 'im upstairs...

00:14.420 --> 00:17.845
and kids they're convinced
aren't actually theirs.

00:17.885 --> 00:18.905
Stay away!

00:18.945 --> 00:22.029
What sounds on earth
could ever replace

00:22.069 --> 00:25.697
kids needing money
or wives in your face?

00:25.737 --> 00:28.235
Cos this, people reckon,
and me included,

00:28.275 --> 00:33.164
is why pubs and drugs
were kindly invented -

00:33.204 --> 00:36.947
to calm us all down,
stop us going mental.

00:36.987 --> 00:41.337
These are Chatsworth Estate's
basic essentials.

00:41.377 --> 00:45.615
We are worth every penny
for grinding your axes.

00:45.655 --> 00:47.830
You shit on our heads

00:47.870 --> 00:50.230
but you pay the taxes!

00:53.352 --> 00:56.398
Imagine a Britain
without Chatsworth buccaneers

00:56.438 --> 00:59.988
who'd come on your face
for the price of a beer.

01:00.028 --> 01:03.698
Make poverty history,
cheaper drugs now!

01:03.708 --> 01:06.871
Make poverty history,
cheaper drugs now!

01:08.892 --> 01:11.656
Scatter. Party!

01:19.456 --> 01:22.185
'I had this mate
when I was a kid.

01:22.225 --> 01:25.729
'He was that rarest of things
round our way, an only child,

01:25.769 --> 01:27.073
'the only lad I've ever known

01:27.083 --> 01:29.222
'who had a bedroom
he didn't have to share,

01:29.262 --> 01:31.328
'clothes that hadn't
been handed down.

01:31.368 --> 01:33.835
'Didn't have to throw
his food down his neck

01:33.875 --> 01:35.891
'before someone else
whipped it off the plate.

01:35.931 --> 01:37.408
'But he was still a miserable twat,

01:37.448 --> 01:40.634
'cos it turns out the one thing
he wanted was the one thing

01:40.674 --> 01:42.913
'his mam and dad couldn't give him
- a brother or sister.

01:42.953 --> 01:46.091
'And I said, "Have mine!
Have any of 'em. Have all of 'em!

01:46.131 --> 01:50.161
'"They're not worth the bother."
And I'll always remember this.

01:50.201 --> 01:52.824
'He said, "I would if I could."'

01:52.864 --> 01:54.546
Ah! Lan!

01:54.586 --> 01:57.074
"I would if I could."

01:57.084 --> 01:58.005
Lan!

02:00.067 --> 02:01.750
Fuck off!

02:03.237 --> 02:04.364
No! Ah!

02:04.404 --> 02:06.801
Shut the fuck up.

02:06.841 --> 02:08.764
Come here, shut the fuck...

02:08.804 --> 02:10.056
Ah!

02:10.097 --> 02:11.224
Aah!

Lan, what the fuck are you doing?

02:32.229 --> 02:34.466
Fucking...

02:34.476 --> 02:35.408
lan!

02:40.384 --> 02:42.514
You shouldn't have done this.

02:42.554 --> 02:43.998
He did this, not you.

02:44.038 --> 02:46.466
We should never have
brought him back here.

02:48.149 --> 02:49.712
He's going to pay.

02:49.752 --> 02:52.761
We'll have to call the police.
And we might need an ambulance, too.

02:54.164 --> 02:55.383
No, him, not me!

02:55.423 --> 02:56.431
Eh?

02:56.471 --> 02:57.614
He could be dead!

03:00.195 --> 03:01.275
Oof!

03:02.187 --> 03:03.204
He's not.

03:03.244 --> 03:05.269
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

03:05.309 --> 03:08.366
What are you worried about him for,
what he nearly did to you?

03:08.406 --> 03:09.714
Hey, it's all right.

03:09.754 --> 03:12.067
You're all right. Hey!

03:12.107 --> 03:13.998
Call the police!

03:14.038 --> 03:17.553
And say what? We're the ones
that'll end up in court.

03:17.593 --> 03:19.066
Seen the state of his face?

03:28.822 --> 03:30.514
D'you reckon that'll work?

03:30.554 --> 03:32.881
She's done her research.
Coppers are behind her.

03:32.891 --> 03:35.170
More supervision than endorsement.

03:35.210 --> 03:38.573
They can't be seen to support
this kind of thing, can they?

03:38.613 --> 03:42.083
Guns for vodka? Unless,
of course, it's a big success,

03:42.123 --> 03:45.361
in which case, they'll be grabbing
all the credit they can.

03:45.371 --> 03:48.114
Even if it just gets
one gun off the street...

03:48.154 --> 03:53.365
"Whoever saves one life
saves the world entire." Talmud.

Bollocks. Gallagher.

03:56.324 --> 03:57.582
Are you still in pain?

03:57.592 --> 03:59.596
Lillian reckons
it might be the menopause.

03:59.606 --> 04:01.808
Stomach upsets could be a symptom.

04:01.848 --> 04:03.514
One of a myriad!

04:04.854 --> 04:06.264
How's your foo-foo?

04:07.126 --> 04:08.913
Your Mary.

04:08.923 --> 04:09.940
Your dugout.

04:09.980 --> 04:12.034
Your flange-o-gasket.

04:12.074 --> 04:13.567
Your sausage purse.

04:13.607 --> 04:16.587
Your flower,
is it full bloom or wilting?

04:16.627 --> 04:19.360
Me fanny? It's fine, thank you.

04:19.399 --> 04:21.389
Lesser men would blush!

04:21.428 --> 04:22.345
Are you irritable?

04:22.385 --> 04:26.132
Well, that's hardly a symptom.
She's always fuckin' irritable.

04:26.172 --> 04:27.406
See?

04:46.312 --> 04:47.747
Another life saved.

04:47.787 --> 04:50.505
Delivered from
a quick death by bullet.

04:50.545 --> 04:52.845
Condemned to
a slow, lingering demise

04:52.885 --> 04:55.088
as cirrhosis rots his young liver.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.316
Hats off to Libby!

DOOR OPENS

05:06.370 --> 05:07.703
We need to leave.

05:07.743 --> 05:09.289
What about Connor?

05:09.329 --> 05:11.444
Maybe it's best if
we leave Connor out of this.

05:11.484 --> 05:13.262
You're his mother.

05:13.302 --> 05:15.720
Besides, I think Jamie
might have his hands full

05:15.760 --> 05:16.863
for the next few days.

05:16.903 --> 05:18.562
Let's stay, watch the fireworks.

05:18.602 --> 05:20.976
He said he'd kill you.
I don't want to lose you.

05:20.986 --> 05:25.679
So you walk out on Connor and
leave him here with them? With him.

05:25.719 --> 05:26.816
Yeah.

05:28.392 --> 05:30.720
No.

05:30.760 --> 05:33.643
I don't know. I don't know!

05:33.683 --> 05:37.262
So we go. We'll fuck off.
Leave the baby, and all that crap.

05:37.302 --> 05:40.815
That guff you were feeding me
about us being a nice little family,

05:40.855 --> 05:42.512
we'll forget about that, yeah?

05:42.552 --> 05:46.108
This wouldn't have happened
if you hadn't said what you did.

05:46.118 --> 05:47.130
You gave me the idea...

05:47.246 --> 05:48.140
Telling Jamie...

05:48.180 --> 05:48.822
Telling Jamie...
...when I was planning on...

05:48.862 --> 05:49.993
Telling Jamie... when I was planning
on... when I told you not to.

05:50.033 --> 05:50.780
...your best mate.

05:50.820 --> 05:51.678
You gave me no choice.

05:51.718 --> 05:52.566
You gave me no choice.
Your fault I fell in love with you.

05:52.606 --> 05:53.696
You gave me no choice. Your fault I fell
in love with you. You gave him no choice!

05:53.736 --> 05:56.092
Me and Mandy were happy enough
before you came along.

05:56.132 --> 05:59.722
I'd never so much
as looked at another woman.

05:59.732 --> 06:01.154
It's down to you...

06:01.194 --> 06:03.987
in your tight tops
and your short skirts.

06:07.166 --> 06:09.737
And it's a good job
I love you as much as I do.

06:12.464 --> 06:14.227
Who else'd have you, eh?

06:19.524 --> 06:22.596
So we stay for Connor. Yeah?

06:24.276 --> 06:25.806
Yeah.

06:25.846 --> 06:27.306
Yeah.

06:27.346 --> 06:29.388
Yeah.

06:40.127 --> 06:43.587
If you're going to drop one,
give us a bit of notice, will you?

06:43.597 --> 06:47.059
Been blaming the dog all morning
and we haven't even got one.

06:47.099 --> 06:49.933
Shut up, you knob.
I want you to keep an eye on him.

06:49.973 --> 06:52.300
Keep him busy,
keep him away from Jamie.

06:52.310 --> 06:54.862
No way! I want to see him
kick the bastard's head in.

06:54.902 --> 06:59.189
Rip his arms off.
Gouge his eyes out! Fry his...

06:59.229 --> 07:00.321
spleen.

07:00.361 --> 07:01.549
Spleen?

07:03.032 --> 07:05.300
Jamie'll be back inside
before he knows it.

07:05.340 --> 07:07.128
What, so we just let it go?

07:07.168 --> 07:10.142
Revenge is a dish best served cold.

07:10.182 --> 07:11.140
What the fuck does that mean?

07:11.180 --> 07:13.050
What the fuck does what mean?

08:42.311 --> 08:44.438
Might be best if you let me go.

08:47.818 --> 08:49.268
Keep my boss off your back.

08:49.308 --> 08:51.436
You're not in any position
to make demands.

08:51.476 --> 08:52.578
He'll be missing me.

08:52.618 --> 08:54.406
I'm sure he'll find someone else

08:54.446 --> 08:57.263
to do whatever the fuck it is
you do for next to nothing.

08:57.303 --> 08:59.305
These jeans cost more
than you earn in a month.

08:59.345 --> 09:01.481
Shoes twice that.

09:01.521 --> 09:03.177
I spend more on a haircut

09:03.217 --> 09:05.577
than you do
on your fucking trackie bottoms.

09:08.146 --> 09:09.568
Eh?

09:16.588 --> 09:20.149
It's interesting.
A slap, not a punch.

09:22.806 --> 09:24.876
I ain't got a clue where I am.

09:27.328 --> 09:28.762
Blindfold me,

09:28.802 --> 09:30.526
stick me in the back of your car,

09:30.536 --> 09:32.695
drop me anywhere you like
- just lose me.

09:32.735 --> 09:34.178
That way,

09:34.218 --> 09:36.386
when he sees what a mess
you made of my face,

09:36.396 --> 09:38.305
he won't be able
to do the same to yours

09:38.345 --> 09:39.964
cos he won't be able to find you.

09:40.004 --> 09:41.237
Think I'm scared
of your sugar daddy?

09:41.277 --> 09:43.172
I think you should be.

09:43.212 --> 09:46.288
Some sad bastard that can only
get a fuck by paying for it?

09:46.328 --> 09:49.555
I'd love to see you
say that to his face.

09:49.595 --> 09:50.930
Yeah.

09:50.970 --> 09:54.680
You haven't called me
a fucking queer yet.

09:54.720 --> 09:58.275
You haven't called me a dirty
little cocksucker. Why's that?

10:00.424 --> 10:02.658
MOBILE PHONE RINGS

10:02.698 --> 10:06.412
He's just noticed I'm missing.

10:14.959 --> 10:16.472
Pocket.

10:42.819 --> 10:44.343
Connor.

10:47.113 --> 10:48.820
I want him back.

10:48.860 --> 10:51.022
We want him back.

10:51.062 --> 10:55.925
We can do this privately, here, now,
or we'll settle it in court.

10:56.789 --> 11:00.615
I don't want to, for Connor's sake,
but I will if I have to.

11:00.655 --> 11:02.867
I want me son.

11:06.008 --> 11:07.942
My son.

11:13.696 --> 11:15.232
DNA test.

11:18.086 --> 11:19.530
My son.

11:23.506 --> 11:26.714
There's more to a father than
just being in at the conception.

11:28.574 --> 11:29.791
See you in court, yeah?

11:50.048 --> 11:53.650
I never would have imagined
there were so many guns out there.

11:53.690 --> 11:56.615
Been in mothballs
since the Hacienda shut up shop.

11:56.655 --> 11:58.666
Manchester, so much to answer for.

11:58.706 --> 12:00.681
All this effort for what?

12:00.721 --> 12:02.624
For a safer community,

12:02.664 --> 12:05.075
to show decent folk
there are other decent folk

12:05.115 --> 12:07.784
who'd be horrified at the prospect
of even holding a gun,

12:07.824 --> 12:09.532
never mind using one.

12:09.572 --> 12:14.224
If my life was in danger, I'd plug
anyone without a second thought.

12:14.264 --> 12:17.178
It sounds like constipation to me.

12:17.218 --> 12:18.724
Oh, I'm in agony.

12:18.764 --> 12:21.545
I need a curry.
That normally clears me pipes.

12:26.926 --> 12:28.609
We need to talk about Roscoe.

12:30.069 --> 12:35.112
McRae supplies him
with a lot of money. 150 grand.

12:35.152 --> 12:36.667
SIR EN W AILS

12:36.707 --> 12:38.918
And the boys are going to rob it.

12:38.958 --> 12:40.459
Shut the fuck up.

12:40.499 --> 12:42.339
Make my fuckin' day!

12:42.379 --> 12:44.658
Give it here, mate. Get the money.

12:44.698 --> 12:46.635
When I find out
who you fuckers are...

12:46.675 --> 12:48.181
Whoo!

12:48.221 --> 12:51.917
Make sure my boys
are ready to handle Roscoe

12:51.957 --> 12:53.612
and whoever comes after him.

12:55.906 --> 12:58.968
Go and tell Jamie
to get out the pub till I ring him.

12:59.008 --> 12:59.923
Just say "Roscoe". Now.

13:02.559 --> 13:04.212
Mimi!

13:04.252 --> 13:05.353
Paddy's not here.

13:05.393 --> 13:06.547
I know.

13:27.006 --> 13:29.452
You don't scare me.

13:30.723 --> 13:34.819
I survived 11 years
of the Thatcher government.

13:38.352 --> 13:39.488
Ah!

13:39.528 --> 13:42.133
He terrifies
the fucking life out of me.

13:42.173 --> 13:44.886
Come on! Backing up, backing up!

13:46.281 --> 13:48.181
Frank?

13:55.124 --> 13:56.737
Are you still alive?

13:56.777 --> 13:58.521
Just.

13:58.561 --> 14:00.084
But you never know, though -

14:00.124 --> 14:02.873
there might be a bullet out there
with me name on it.

14:02.883 --> 14:04.043
Could be one in here.

14:36.036 --> 14:37.734
What can I do for you?

14:37.774 --> 14:39.260
More what I can do for you.

14:39.300 --> 14:43.913
Word might get round that you're...
vulnerable, Mimi.

14:46.574 --> 14:48.148
A woman on her own.

14:48.188 --> 14:51.572
I'm covered, Roscoe. Safe.

15:28.710 --> 15:31.258
Roscoe. Nutcase runs Moss Side.

15:33.642 --> 15:37.078
Lan, we need help with this.
This is way out of our league.

15:37.992 --> 15:40.184
Call Carl.

15:40.224 --> 15:41.576
What the fuck use will he be?

15:41.616 --> 15:43.983
You can trust him.
He'll be able to help us.

15:44.023 --> 15:45.931
This first person
you think of is Carl.

15:45.971 --> 15:48.374
The first fucking thought
that comes into your head,

15:48.414 --> 15:51.546
the first word that comes
out of your mouth, and it's him.

15:51.586 --> 15:52.597
I wonder why that is.

15:52.637 --> 15:54.293
Because he's your brother.

15:54.303 --> 15:57.090
DOORBELL RINGS

16:06.008 --> 16:07.157
May we come in?

16:07.197 --> 16:08.490
No.

16:08.530 --> 16:10.074
Maybe if we just come in...

16:10.114 --> 16:11.594
No, no, no. Honestly.

16:11.634 --> 16:15.940
It's not a good time. I did say no.
You know how persistent they can be.

16:16.952 --> 16:18.452
You'll have to go.

16:18.492 --> 16:22.503
Not before you answer me
one question. Have you found him?

16:22.543 --> 16:24.035
No.

16:24.075 --> 16:25.081
We haven't found anybody. Have we?

16:25.121 --> 16:26.107
We haven't found anybody. Have we?
No. No-one.

16:26.117 --> 16:27.801
Would you let him into your life?

16:27.841 --> 16:29.843
Who?

16:29.883 --> 16:31.433
Jesus.

16:31.473 --> 16:33.073
No, I can't, I'm too busy.

16:33.083 --> 16:34.722
Two minutes of your time.

16:34.732 --> 16:36.178
Help!

16:36.218 --> 16:37.088
Someone need you?

16:37.128 --> 16:38.466
Someone need you?
Help! Fucking help me!

16:38.476 --> 16:39.626
Er, it's the radio.

16:39.666 --> 16:41.153
They'll fucking kill me!

16:41.193 --> 16:43.615
Archers.

16:43.655 --> 16:45.085
Help! I'm in the kitchen!

16:45.125 --> 16:46.535
Come in.

16:46.575 --> 16:47.779
What?!

16:47.819 --> 16:50.045
Have a coffee. Tell us about God.

16:50.085 --> 16:51.657
Maybe I could leave a pamphlet.

16:51.697 --> 16:53.889
Fuck the pamphlet.
We need your help, now!

16:53.929 --> 16:55.619
Any advice you can give us. Really!

16:55.629 --> 16:57.659
Yeah, we're ripe for a conversion.

16:57.699 --> 16:59.699
He's a sodomite
and I've lain with his brother.

16:59.739 --> 17:01.275
Whoa! Get out!

17:05.185 --> 17:06.232
Fuck!

17:27.392 --> 17:29.452
This estate has gone to the dogs.

17:29.462 --> 17:31.670
Paddy Maguire's took
his eye off the ball

17:31.680 --> 17:33.913
and the peasants
have gone fucking feral.

17:33.953 --> 17:34.937
No respect.

17:34.977 --> 17:36.377
That's why I called you.

17:36.417 --> 17:40.275
I took it upon meself to install
a bit of discipline into their lives

17:40.315 --> 17:42.280
and get feudal on their arses.

17:42.320 --> 17:44.812
You might want to pull
the shutters down on your shop.

17:44.852 --> 17:46.854
Might not be round
long enough to need to.

17:46.894 --> 17:49.680
Thanks for that tip
about the Jockey.

17:49.720 --> 17:53.348
I'll do a nice bit of business
out of there. I owe you.

17:53.388 --> 17:55.747
Yeah.

17:57.809 --> 18:02.699
Ssh! I don't want him near the pub
in case Karen and Joe turn up.

18:02.739 --> 18:05.412
Nappies, wipes.

18:05.452 --> 18:07.058
He's due a feed in half an hour.

18:07.098 --> 18:09.961
Bung it in the microwave,
take the chill off it, yeah?

18:10.001 --> 18:12.249
Breast's best, y'know.
Builds up his immune system.

18:12.259 --> 18:13.318
So I've heard.

18:13.358 --> 18:15.498
My Rodney's never had a cold.

18:15.538 --> 18:18.934
33 and not even as much as a sniff.
He was on the tit till he were 11.

18:20.092 --> 18:22.616
They had to stop
when the dentist fitted his brace.

18:22.656 --> 18:25.534
If only one of us were lactating(!)

18:25.574 --> 18:28.784
I only have to hear a baby cry
and I'm off like a garden sprinkler.

18:28.824 --> 18:30.720
See? Mother Nature's miracle.

18:30.760 --> 18:32.483
Fuckin' hell.

18:45.561 --> 18:49.092
Ssh! Roscoe could
come in any second.

18:49.132 --> 18:52.775
Mam's managed to convince him that
the scheme's worth a second chance,

18:52.815 --> 18:54.370
which means more guns in that box.

18:54.410 --> 18:56.021
You got me in here to tell me that?

18:56.031 --> 18:59.061
Kneecaps Neville said if we can
get our hands on any shooters,

18:59.101 --> 19:00.219
he'd give us a good price.

19:00.259 --> 19:02.977
Reckons he can shift the lot.
We'll be minted!

19:03.017 --> 19:05.514
So all we've got to do, then,
is distract the copper...

19:07.349 --> 19:09.576
...unscrew the six-inch bolts
from the floor,

19:09.616 --> 19:12.258
pick up the bin
with all the hardware inside

19:12.298 --> 19:15.659
and sneak it out
without anybody noticing.

19:17.685 --> 19:19.726
Mam, when you was
in labour with Micky,

19:19.766 --> 19:21.752
was he deprived
of oxygen at any point?

19:21.762 --> 19:22.839
No.

19:22.879 --> 19:24.274
Did your diet lack nutrients

19:24.314 --> 19:26.682
essential for foetal
neurological development?

19:26.722 --> 19:27.296
No.

19:27.336 --> 19:28.099
Dropped him on his head?

19:28.139 --> 19:29.938
That was you.

19:29.978 --> 19:31.332
So your behaviour wasn't any
different to any of the rest of us?

19:31.372 --> 19:33.244
No. Why?

19:33.284 --> 19:36.337
I was just wondering, y'know,
how he became so earth-shatteringly

19:36.377 --> 19:37.646
fucking thick!

19:37.686 --> 19:38.658
Could be hereditary.

19:40.710 --> 19:44.578
Well, y'know, on Paddy's side,
obviously.

19:45.926 --> 19:47.213
Y'know, potato famine.

19:47.253 --> 19:49.820
Lack of... spuds.

19:49.860 --> 19:51.981
Bound to have an effect
on the old...

20:07.279 --> 20:10.082
So, the girl's, what...

20:10.122 --> 20:12.336
a friend?

20:12.376 --> 20:14.110
Girlfriend?

20:17.426 --> 20:19.794
Still haven't decided
what to do with you yet.

20:19.804 --> 20:23.554
Radar's working overtime,
I'm not getting "girlfriend".

20:23.594 --> 20:25.565
I could kill you now
and no-one'd ever know.

20:25.605 --> 20:27.060
Not the way you looked at me.

20:27.100 --> 20:27.913
Bury you on the moor.

20:27.953 --> 20:28.572
Seen that a thousand times.

20:28.612 --> 20:29.662
Don't push it!

20:29.702 --> 20:32.129
Been in the backs of cars with men
like you. They have that same look.

20:32.169 --> 20:33.438
Been in the backs of cars with men like
you. They have that same look. What look?

20:33.478 --> 20:35.475
That one.

20:35.515 --> 20:38.896
Fucking the arse off me
while I'm bent over the baby seat.

20:48.256 --> 20:51.832
Sugar daddy's little foible.
Had his favourite gun modified.

20:51.872 --> 20:52.856
Piss.

20:57.166 --> 21:00.192
I thought you didn't have the
bottle, but now I know you have.

21:03.974 --> 21:07.666
Let me go. Please. Lan?

21:07.706 --> 21:09.640
I heard her say your name before.

21:09.680 --> 21:12.464
I'll do anything
to get out of here alive.

21:12.504 --> 21:14.346
Anything.

21:14.386 --> 21:17.783
You say when and where.

21:17.823 --> 21:20.217
It'll be our little secret.

21:26.412 --> 21:29.409
You'd sooner fuck me
than kill me, wouldn't you?

21:29.449 --> 21:31.900
Yeah.

21:34.217 --> 21:35.684
Yeah, I would.

21:49.634 --> 21:52.007
What's that? Hostage negotiations?

21:52.047 --> 21:54.261
Well, it's true.

21:54.271 --> 21:58.133
Fuck's sake, Mags, wouldn't you
sooner fuck anyone than kill them?

21:58.173 --> 22:01.682
Ian, that shouldn't have even
crossed your fucking mind!

22:08.696 --> 22:10.744
I am committed to you.

22:15.414 --> 22:19.860
I've entertained the idea of
me and you getting married.

22:19.900 --> 22:22.644
It's crossed my mind
having kids one day,

22:22.684 --> 22:24.202
y'know, the way it does.

22:26.475 --> 22:32.138
I get as far as the wedding day
and me and you at the altar

22:32.178 --> 22:34.724
when the priest asks,

22:34.764 --> 22:38.216
"If anyone knows of any reason why
these two shouldn't get married..."

22:39.606 --> 22:41.767
And I turn to you...

22:43.372 --> 22:45.101
...and I say, "Promise...

22:47.446 --> 22:49.692
"...promise me

22:49.732 --> 22:54.274
"you will never, ever even think
about sleeping with another man."

22:54.314 --> 22:57.063
But you'd never ask a straight bloke

22:57.103 --> 22:59.770
to promise never to think about
sleeping with another woman.

23:02.866 --> 23:04.527
Which is what you say at the altar.

23:07.850 --> 23:10.341
Which is why I walk out.

23:19.567 --> 23:21.143
You want to see him dead?

23:21.183 --> 23:23.509
Lan! No!

23:28.902 --> 23:30.164
MOBILE PHONE RINGS

23:33.493 --> 23:36.000
Ten minutes. Hold the fort.

23:36.040 --> 23:37.332
Where are you off?

23:37.372 --> 23:38.592
Mind your fuckin' own.

23:38.632 --> 23:40.302
When I run the risk of the Maguires

23:40.342 --> 23:43.034
legging it in here and taking
a pop at you, it is my fucking own!

23:43.074 --> 23:44.602
Don't open until I get back.

23:44.642 --> 23:45.764
Joe...

23:45.804 --> 23:47.296
I'm just on my way out.

23:47.336 --> 23:48.830
Where're you going?

23:48.870 --> 23:51.350
Pack your stuff.
Wait in the car for me.

23:51.390 --> 23:53.568
We're getting out of this shithole.

24:07.340 --> 24:08.394
Kellie.

24:08.434 --> 24:09.528
Special request.

24:09.568 --> 24:11.569
I told you I was off duty
till later.

24:11.609 --> 24:13.484
You've been asked for, recommended.

24:13.524 --> 24:14.870
By who?

24:14.910 --> 24:16.053
A big tipper.

24:24.892 --> 24:26.120
Karen?

24:29.537 --> 24:31.802
Are you OK? Hey...

24:31.842 --> 24:35.313
I just need to make him understand
exactly what's going on in my mind.

24:35.353 --> 24:37.691
How can I do that
when I hardly know myself?

24:37.731 --> 24:40.084
I need to be honest, but I'm
not sure it's honesty he wants.

24:40.124 --> 24:40.789
Jamie or Joe?

24:40.829 --> 24:42.656
I've built
this kind of fantasy world.

24:42.696 --> 24:44.935
It doesn't stand up.
It's built on nothing.

24:44.975 --> 24:49.485
It's what he wants things to be,
as opposed to the way they are.

24:49.525 --> 24:50.802
Joe.

24:50.842 --> 24:54.340
We're leaving,
and I don't know if I want to.

24:56.537 --> 24:57.863
Just tell him.

24:57.903 --> 24:59.614
You know what he's like.

24:59.654 --> 25:03.459
If you need to speak to him
and you want someone to be there...

25:05.694 --> 25:09.403
You're best keeping out of it.
But thanks.

25:16.295 --> 25:17.776
Fuck...

25:17.816 --> 25:19.052
I'm coming with you.

25:19.092 --> 25:21.380
Don't get involved.
It's not your business.

25:21.420 --> 25:24.919
No, you're my mate. I'll come.
Look, I've got nowhere else to be.

25:24.959 --> 25:27.339
I'll jump in the boot.
He won't even know I'm there.

25:27.379 --> 25:29.600
Fuck off, lan.

25:29.640 --> 25:31.022
You're more mad than I am.

25:34.689 --> 25:37.715
Karen! You ready? We're going.

25:42.478 --> 25:43.588
Karen!

25:43.628 --> 25:47.217
I told you to get your stuff!
Come on.

25:48.669 --> 25:50.751
For fuck's sake, Karen!

26:02.180 --> 26:07.220
Grab what you need
and leave the rest. Now!

26:19.321 --> 26:21.858
It's another fiver for
extracurricular.

26:38.246 --> 26:39.858
Fuck!

26:39.898 --> 26:43.988
Lillian! Lillian!

26:46.466 --> 26:49.820
CONNOR CRIES

26:49.860 --> 26:51.842
You haven't seen us, right?

26:51.882 --> 26:54.037
Put the clothes in the back.

27:02.834 --> 27:05.910
Connor. It's me, it's Mummy.

27:05.950 --> 27:07.200
Right, Karen... Karen!

27:07.240 --> 27:08.553
Right!

27:10.050 --> 27:12.206
Cheers, mate.

27:12.246 --> 27:14.140
Tell Roscoe we're quits.

27:36.397 --> 27:38.454
Where the fuck are they?

27:38.494 --> 27:40.240
They got in a car,
they just ran out.

27:40.280 --> 27:41.460
Where are they going?

27:41.500 --> 27:42.656
I don't know...

27:42.696 --> 27:45.458
They've got my son!
They've got my fucking son!

27:45.498 --> 27:46.719
Please, Jamie...

27:46.759 --> 27:48.482
Fuck.

27:49.948 --> 27:51.027
What?

27:51.067 --> 27:52.904
Jamie, no. Roscoe's out there.

27:58.170 --> 28:00.840
I will hunt you down.

28:00.880 --> 28:04.880
I don't care where I have to go,
what I have to do, how long it takes!

28:04.920 --> 28:08.782
I will track you down
and I will fucking kill you!

28:17.826 --> 28:22.657
With all the excitement, I forgot
to ask where it is we're heading to.

28:22.697 --> 28:24.028
Surprise.

28:24.068 --> 28:26.617
I think I've had enough surprises
for one day.

28:26.657 --> 28:30.270
Shouldn't take us too long to get
there. Three, four hours tops.

28:30.310 --> 28:32.329
Where?

28:35.741 --> 28:37.345
Like we can afford that(!)

28:40.544 --> 28:42.091
You've bought?

28:46.098 --> 28:47.577
This is too fast, Joe.

28:48.682 --> 28:51.442
Yesterday, I was somebody's wife.

28:51.482 --> 28:53.181
I knew what to do when I got up,

28:53.221 --> 28:55.184
what needed to be done
before I went to bed.

28:55.194 --> 28:56.728
I had a routine.

28:56.768 --> 29:00.619
Boring. Predictable. Mundane.
Mind-numbing. Your words, not mine.

29:00.659 --> 29:02.229
Yeah, but...
No buts.

29:02.269 --> 29:04.894
You said it, Karen,
time after time.

29:04.934 --> 29:08.214
But that's just what you say
when things get too much.

29:08.254 --> 29:10.465
It's your way of coping.

29:10.505 --> 29:11.614
This is what you wanted.

29:11.654 --> 29:12.911
This is what you wanted.
This is what you told me I wanted.

29:12.951 --> 29:15.285
Would you make your fucking mind up?

29:15.325 --> 29:16.889
CONNOR CRIES

29:22.160 --> 29:23.993
I know what this is all about.

29:24.003 --> 29:25.294
You've had your meds.

29:25.334 --> 29:27.506
What's that got to do with anything?

29:27.546 --> 29:32.125
You should try and give them a miss
now and again. You're more fun.

29:36.219 --> 29:37.275
Cheers.

29:37.315 --> 29:38.697
Ta.

29:40.894 --> 29:43.608
Can't believe the filth
fell for that.

29:43.648 --> 29:44.994
Hundred per cent.

29:45.034 --> 29:46.508
Unlike the vodka.

29:46.548 --> 29:49.064
They're turning a blind eye
to the incentive,

29:49.104 --> 29:52.443
but willing to try anything for a
result, and it seems to be working.

29:56.145 --> 29:59.870
My Brendon was shot.
I say shot, I mean assassinated.

29:59.910 --> 30:01.185
Was he a politician, an MP?

30:01.225 --> 30:02.887
Was he a politician, an MP?
No.

30:02.927 --> 30:06.449
He worked in the abattoir.
He was the one who, y'know...

30:06.459 --> 30:11.723
His was the last face seen
by many an unfortunate bovine.

30:11.763 --> 30:13.918
I reckon it was a homie
who had an eye on my patch.

30:15.617 --> 30:18.269
What, your fucking cabbage patch?

30:18.309 --> 30:19.414
Lillian!

30:19.454 --> 30:21.600
Your work on this planet is done.

30:21.610 --> 30:24.425
Return to your own people.
It's impressed no-one.

30:24.465 --> 30:27.444
They're gonna come and surprise me.
Wait and see if they don't.

30:27.484 --> 30:30.070
It's gonna be a horse's head
and offers I can't refuse.

30:30.110 --> 30:32.732
Fuck knows, it's been years
since you've had one of them.

30:34.542 --> 30:38.694
Nothing you'd like to hand
to the policeman, Mr Roscoe?

30:39.954 --> 30:42.313
Me phone number.

30:42.353 --> 30:45.489
Wit as well as good looks(!)
What a catch...

30:45.529 --> 30:46.753
Do you know who I am?

30:46.763 --> 30:47.868
Do you know who I am?

30:47.908 --> 30:49.607
It's not a game of
Who The Fuck Are You?

30:49.647 --> 30:51.795
You wanna keep your missus
under control, Frank.

30:51.835 --> 30:55.065
It's nothing to do with me! If you
want a pop at her, go for it.

30:55.105 --> 30:56.104
DOOR SLAMS

30:56.144 --> 30:57.858
Fuckin' hell!

30:57.898 --> 30:59.517
Villains!

30:59.557 --> 31:02.133
You get rid of one and another
springs up in their place, eh?

31:02.173 --> 31:03.642
You get rid of one and another springs
up in their place, eh? Like warts.

31:03.682 --> 31:07.415
I never thought I'd say this,
but bring back Paddy Maguire, eh?

31:07.455 --> 31:08.916
Cheers! Cheers!

31:15.113 --> 31:17.093
What are you doing?

31:17.133 --> 31:19.484
I've gotta lay low
till Jamie pops Roscoe,

31:19.494 --> 31:21.946
so I thought I'd put me time
to good use. Cut through here,

31:21.986 --> 31:26.674
grab the guns, pass 'em to Kneecaps
and I'm quids in.

31:26.714 --> 31:28.610
Except that if you carry on
sawing there,

31:28.650 --> 31:30.590
you'll have the
fruit machine through.

31:30.630 --> 31:32.499
I measured it.
Five paces from the wall.

31:32.539 --> 31:33.739
That's not the same wall.

31:34.798 --> 31:36.574
This is the support wall.

31:36.584 --> 31:39.028
The wall upstairs
is the stud wall.

31:39.068 --> 31:41.485
You're about... six foot out.

31:41.525 --> 31:42.827
CREAKING

31:45.249 --> 31:46.521
...here.

31:46.561 --> 31:48.105
Good luck, Micky.

31:48.145 --> 31:49.403
Is me mam back?

31:49.413 --> 31:52.222
She's behind the bar with Kelly.

31:52.262 --> 31:54.127
Right.
You can help me get these guns.

31:54.167 --> 31:56.149
60-40. 50-50.

31:56.189 --> 31:58.492
65-35. Bye, Micky.

31:59.882 --> 32:00.964
FOOTSTEPS ON STAIRS

32:00.974 --> 32:02.748
FOOTSTEPS ON STAIRS
Look, all right.

32:09.264 --> 32:10.756
I can't stop smiling!

32:10.766 --> 32:12.966
You, me, Junior...

32:13.006 --> 32:16.110
I can't believe we did that.
I wish I'd seen Jamie's face.

32:16.150 --> 32:17.190
This is funny?

32:17.230 --> 32:19.700
This is funny?
Karen, this is fuckin' hysterical.

32:19.740 --> 32:22.082
That bastard's hidden
behind his family for too long.

32:22.122 --> 32:24.107
Get him on his own and all he is
is his father's son.

32:26.185 --> 32:27.256
BABY WHIMPERS

32:27.296 --> 32:29.405
I thought this is what you wanted -
you, me and him.

32:29.445 --> 32:31.092
Him?

32:31.132 --> 32:35.301
I just never thought this'd be
the way I got him, that's all.

32:37.080 --> 32:38.231
How did you manage it?

32:38.271 --> 32:40.940
You should've seen his face.

32:40.980 --> 32:43.710
Went up to him this morning -
"Give us Connor back!"

32:43.750 --> 32:45.028
You did that?

32:45.068 --> 32:47.412
You were missing your child.
Of course I did.

32:47.452 --> 32:48.760
"Not your kid," he says.

32:48.800 --> 32:50.776
DNA test says he is!

32:50.816 --> 32:52.325
You've had a test done?

32:52.365 --> 32:55.533
You've had a test done and you
didn't even think to tell me?

33:04.078 --> 33:07.195
He didn't know that, did he?
Didn't even look at it, thank fuck.

33:07.235 --> 33:08.686
So he thinks Connor's yours?

33:10.911 --> 33:12.695
What did he say?

33:12.735 --> 33:14.449
The sort of crap
you'd expect from him.

33:14.489 --> 33:17.037
Some sentimental bullshit
about how it takes

33:17.077 --> 33:20.114
more than being in at the conception
to be a dad.

33:20.154 --> 33:21.391
Tosser.

33:21.431 --> 33:22.972
The baby.

33:26.287 --> 33:28.118
All behind us now, though, eh?

33:29.353 --> 33:32.370
Soon as we get settled,
get the divorce over and done with,

33:32.410 --> 33:34.334
nice little house,
a few kids of our own...

33:34.374 --> 33:36.216
"Of our own"?

33:36.256 --> 33:38.980
You know what I mean -
a few little Pritchards.

33:47.098 --> 33:49.373
CAR DOOR OPENS, THEN SHUTS

33:54.584 --> 33:56.981
Do you come here often?

33:57.021 --> 33:58.517
Not often enough.

34:01.522 --> 34:05.254
And you don't fucking heed
what is being said.

34:05.294 --> 34:06.694
I'm just telling the truth.

34:06.734 --> 34:07.706
Roscoe!

34:10.172 --> 34:11.960
Oh, fuckin' hell, he's pissed!

34:12.000 --> 34:13.636
He's pissed!

34:13.676 --> 34:16.754
Oi! Thought you was supposed
to be offering us protection.

34:16.764 --> 34:17.476
I need protection
from this soft sod.

34:17.516 --> 34:19.674
Sit down.

34:19.684 --> 34:21.918
Something that I've always
wanted to know...

34:21.958 --> 34:23.293
Fuck off.

34:26.896 --> 34:31.446
Hello again! Just been
working down in the cellar.

34:31.485 --> 34:33.091
Love working up a sweat, though.

34:33.130 --> 34:34.447
Oh, aye?

34:34.487 --> 34:35.630
Thirsty work.

34:37.828 --> 34:40.731
Better get you a drink, then, eh?

34:40.771 --> 34:43.380
My usual and whatever
this young man wants.

34:43.420 --> 34:44.802

34:57.215 --> 34:59.240
CAR ALARM BEEPS

35:04.024 --> 35:06.572
Oi! You little bastards!

35:08.975 --> 35:10.818
We meet again.

35:13.742 --> 35:15.678
Is Jamie in, Mimi?

35:15.718 --> 35:18.980
I'd steer well clear for now,
if I were you.

35:19.020 --> 35:21.700
What happened with the baby -
I didn't have a clue?

35:21.710 --> 35:23.241
Not now, Chesney, I'm dying.

35:23.281 --> 35:24.960
It had nowt to do with me!

35:25.000 --> 35:26.359
I'm fuckin' dying!

35:35.113 --> 35:38.895
Oh... I'm just trying to ring you!

I'm guessing that's the other two.

36:11.506 --> 36:13.524

36:13.564 --> 36:14.895

Roscoe's here. He's got Jamie.

36:30.075 --> 36:32.999
What's Connor gonna do for a dad
if you're not here?

36:39.842 --> 36:40.988
Eee...

36:41.028 --> 36:43.322
Whoa, Frank, Frank!
Look, we need your help.

36:43.332 --> 36:46.985
Once we get the guns,
we go upstairs and we sort Roscoe.

36:47.025 --> 36:50.001
Ha! A poof, a psycho,

36:50.041 --> 36:51.173

36:51.213 --> 36:52.049
Piss artist?

36:52.089 --> 36:54.240
Piss artist?
I was gonna say "invalid", actually.

36:54.280 --> 36:56.521
What fucking use are we gonna be?!

36:56.561 --> 36:58.913

37:11.595 --> 37:13.171

37:13.211 --> 37:14.208
Oh, fuck...

37:14.248 --> 37:16.221
Look! And it may get tough.

37:17.623 --> 37:21.172
And some of us...
might not get out alive.

37:22.555 --> 37:24.762
But at least we tried.

37:26.670 --> 37:30.237
The odds may be stacked against us...

37:30.277 --> 37:31.283
but we can do this.

37:33.886 --> 37:38.768
Just remember what it was that
turned this country from Britain...

37:38.808 --> 37:40.841
into Great Britain.

37:40.881 --> 37:41.601
Courage, tenacity...

37:52.607 --> 37:53.790
Are you with us?

38:06.613 --> 38:08.990
You need to cut there.

38:20.174 --> 38:22.096
Might help
if you were a little less tense.

38:23.922 --> 38:25.537
Well, he'll be picking up on that.

38:33.674 --> 38:36.359
You think Jamie's
just gonna let this go?

38:37.488 --> 38:40.566
The trick with people like Jamie,

38:40.606 --> 38:45.514
all the Maguires, is to make them
believe they're better than they are,

38:45.554 --> 38:49.216
convince them
they're more intelligent than you,

38:49.256 --> 38:51.960
stronger than you,
more ruthless than you.

38:52.000 --> 38:56.454
And whilst they're busy going round
thinking they're God's gift...

38:59.662 --> 39:01.571
If he finds out...
I can handle him.

39:01.611 --> 39:02.960
And what about Paddy?

39:03.000 --> 39:04.758
Cos when he hears...
He won't.

39:04.798 --> 39:08.319
He's not the only one
with family in Ireland.

39:10.113 --> 39:12.468

we'll be seeing Paddy again.

Meat Loaf. Modern poet.

Yeah, but, er,
he didn't actually write...

40:17.123 --> 40:18.135
You owe me.

40:19.485 --> 40:21.866
The money we robbed off you
was counterfeit.

40:21.906 --> 40:24.788
It wasn't worth the paper
it was printed on.

40:24.828 --> 40:25.755
I don't give a fuck.

40:26.718 --> 40:30.548
It cost me 150K of gear. You owe me.

40:30.588 --> 40:32.725
We'll get you your money.

40:32.765 --> 40:35.558
And what about the damage
to my reputation?

40:42.609 --> 40:44.897
How are you gonna
compensate me for that?

40:44.907 --> 40:46.784
What have you got in mind?

40:47.446 --> 40:49.266
This place.

40:51.274 --> 40:53.043
You should let these people go.

40:53.083 --> 40:55.473
They've got nothing to do with this.

40:55.513 --> 40:57.756
Nobody's going anywhere
until your brother shows up

40:57.796 --> 40:59.812
and I don't care how long it takes.

40:59.852 --> 41:02.268
Why don't you let the women go?

41:02.308 --> 41:04.736
How about letting the women
speak for themselves?

41:05.754 --> 41:07.676
I'm not going without you.

41:11.222 --> 41:16.102
And I'm not going if she's not.
 And if you kill one of them,

41:16.142 --> 41:18.320
you're gonna have to kill all of us.

41:29.906 --> 41:31.532
Are you gonna tell me

41:31.572 --> 41:34.154
whatever the fuck it is
that's on your mind?

41:34.194 --> 41:38.298
Everything's changed. Everything.

41:38.338 --> 41:40.944
Who you are,
or at least who I thought you were.

41:40.984 --> 41:43.630
I thought you'd be pleased.
Pleased?!

41:43.670 --> 41:45.614
The things I'd done to get you,
to win you.

41:45.654 --> 41:48.322
"Win"?!
You're having second thoughts.

41:48.362 --> 41:50.997
Joe, I've not even had time
to have first thoughts!

41:51.007 --> 41:53.386
I've not even had time
to think about what it is

41:53.396 --> 41:56.558
that I genuinely want.
You've forced the situation.

41:56.598 --> 41:58.006
I didn't choose this

41:58.046 --> 42:01.521
and Connor didn't choose this.

42:02.554 --> 42:06.606
Then choose now. Choose!
You're frightening him.

42:06.646 --> 42:08.271
Give him to Jamie.
He's such a good fucking dad.

42:08.311 --> 42:09.382
He's my son.
You were trying

42:09.422 --> 42:10.431
to get rid of him a few months back.

42:10.471 --> 42:12.582
Couldn't stand the sight of him.
I was ill.

42:12.592 --> 42:14.376

and you were parking Junior...

42:14.416 --> 42:15.398

42:16.516 --> 42:17.728
Screaming my name

42:17.768 --> 42:18.841
I was ill!

42:18.881 --> 42:21.111
I sacrificed everything for you,
and this is how you repay me?

42:21.151 --> 42:24.899

this is what I want." Well, fuck you!

I'm sorry! And I'm stupid.
I didn't mean...

42:35.226 --> 42:37.955
Is that what you told Mandy? "You
drove me to it. It's not my fault."

42:37.995 --> 42:40.882
Who the fuck are you phoning?
I knew it wouldn't work. I knew it.

42:40.922 --> 42:44.168
Me and you might have been all right
for a few hours behind Jamie's back.

42:44.208 --> 42:45.726
Agh! Joe, no!

42:47.988 --> 42:49.808
You're calling him?!

42:52.643 --> 42:54.542
We've not got a chance.

42:54.582 --> 42:55.506
After everything
I've done for ya...

42:55.546 --> 42:56.899
After everything I've done
for ya... Connor deserves...

42:56.939 --> 42:58.978
...sacrificed for ya...
I need to get home.

42:59.018 --> 43:01.372
I need to sort this...
He doesn't love you!

43:01.412 --> 43:02.548
...and tell him that this,
from start to finish...

43:02.588 --> 43:05.483
He doesn't love you like I love you!
...was a big mistake.

43:07.119 --> 43:08.746
I never loved you.

43:10.898 --> 43:12.240
You were a fuck.

43:15.366 --> 43:16.264
Say you love me.

43:18.095 --> 43:19.596
Say that you love me!

43:22.433 --> 43:24.264
Get off me!
Do you love me?

43:25.611 --> 43:26.744
Say you love me.

43:26.784 --> 43:29.306
Please, Karen.

43:29.316 --> 43:30.931
Say you love me...

43:32.681 --> 43:35.954
...more than Jamie! Say you love me!

43:35.994 --> 43:38.263
CRUNCH!

43:40.531 --> 43:42.317
CRUNCH!

43:48.303 --> 43:50.632
Hey? Hey?

43:50.672 --> 43:51.849
Hey?

44:01.020 --> 44:02.098
Listen, right?

44:02.138 --> 44:05.362
Go home and do whatever it takes
to make it work with Jamie.

44:05.402 --> 44:06.920
I'll take care of this. You go.

44:10.563 --> 44:12.963
Look, just go. Just go.

44:27.616 --> 44:29.170
Ssh, Connor. It's OK.

44:50.824 --> 44:51.779
ENGINE STARTS UP

45:14.711 --> 45:17.999
CLOCK TICKS

45:23.906 --> 45:26.751
It doesn't look like he's coming.

45:26.761 --> 45:27.904
So what's it to be?

45:27.944 --> 45:30.362
This is not your fight.

45:30.402 --> 45:31.684
You point a gun
at my friends' heads,

45:31.724 --> 45:33.987
you make it my fight.
Fuck's sake!

45:34.027 --> 45:36.540
You can go, all of ya.

45:36.580 --> 45:38.258
But you two...

45:39.148 --> 45:40.422
...stay.

45:40.462 --> 45:42.635
Doesn't sound like
a very good deal to me.

45:42.675 --> 45:43.996
Or me!
 Or me.

45:44.036 --> 45:44.973
Or me.
And me.

45:45.013 --> 45:46.371
Or me.
Or me.

45:46.411 --> 45:47.790
Or me.
Or me.

45:47.830 --> 45:49.387
Or me.
Or me.

45:49.427 --> 45:50.924
Or me.
Or me.

45:50.934 --> 45:52.274
Or me.
Or me.

45:52.314 --> 45:54.310
Or me.
Or me.

45:57.580 --> 45:59.662
I was forced into it.

45:59.702 --> 46:02.377
Oh, for fuck's sake. Or me.

46:07.938 --> 46:10.184
Ohhhhhh!

46:14.762 --> 46:17.245
Oh! Oh! Oh...

46:18.938 --> 46:20.870
'What is it they say?

46:20.910 --> 46:24.578
'You can choose your friends,
but you can't choose your family?

46:24.618 --> 46:27.159
'Cos in the end,
that's all you've got, innit?

46:27.199 --> 46:29.174
'Family.

46:29.184 --> 46:31.818
'It doesn't matter
if family's you and your mates,

46:31.858 --> 46:32.874
'you and your girl,

46:32.914 --> 46:34.257
'you and your fella,

46:34.297 --> 46:35.886
'or you, your mam, dad,

46:35.926 --> 46:37.641
'and those bastards
that stuck your head under the duvet

46:37.681 --> 46:39.849
'when they farted. It's all family.'

46:39.859 --> 46:41.645
Checkmate!

46:44.800 --> 46:47.566
I don't think so, Roscoe.

46:57.580 --> 46:59.199
Eh... eh... eh...

47:00.996 --> 47:03.333
'It's all family.

47:06.524 --> 47:07.639
'All of it.'

47:10.721 --> 47:12.894
Fuck...

47:15.636 --> 47:21.667
