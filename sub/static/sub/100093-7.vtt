ROCHELLE: I've been trying to reach you.

00:12.221 --> 00:15.224
It was a pain, but I spoke
to every media outlet,

00:15.307 --> 00:18.185
I reimbursed every publication
for travel expenses.

00:18.227 --> 00:21.939
We can talk about you
reimbursing me another time.

00:21.981 --> 00:24.316
So as far as the media
is concerned,

00:24.358 --> 00:29.363
Soop is momentarily
delayed until TBD.

00:29.405 --> 00:30.781
Now, I know
what you're thinking:

00:30.823 --> 00:33.284
you want to blame someone,
most likely me,

00:33.325 --> 00:37.037
but this is not my fault.

00:37.079 --> 00:39.457
Okay, there is no easy way
for me to say this,

00:39.498 --> 00:43.169
so I am just going to say it.

00:43.210 --> 00:45.004
Soop is dead.

00:45.045 --> 00:46.672
Wade froze your bank accounts.

00:46.714 --> 00:49.175
We've got no money
and no options.

00:49.216 --> 00:51.343
Though we do have
a pending trademark lawsuit,

00:51.385 --> 00:53.012
so that's exciting.

00:53.053 --> 00:54.847
Seems Gwyneth's got a bug
up her ass

00:54.889 --> 00:56.474
about Soop being
too close to Goop.

00:56.515 --> 00:58.142
Which, obviously,
they're different,

00:58.184 --> 01:01.645
but that doesn't matter now.

01:01.687 --> 01:05.649
And I want to remind you
that I did warn you about Wade.

01:05.691 --> 01:09.069
I advised you to talk to him
about having your own account,

01:09.111 --> 01:11.071
but you decided
to be sneaky about it.

01:11.113 --> 01:14.200
You did.
And you had to do it fast,

01:14.241 --> 01:16.577
and you didn't get your own line
of credit secured,

01:16.619 --> 01:19.163
which I advised,

01:19.163 --> 01:21.916
so that's why we ended up here.

Of course you do.

01:27.129 --> 01:28.631
This is what you do.

01:28.672 --> 01:31.300
You know that's not true.

01:33.260 --> 01:36.680
We should just agree
to disagree.

01:39.683 --> 01:43.395

when people say that.

02:50.963 --> 02:52.798
is hiding behind an NDA
and refusing to answer

02:52.840 --> 02:54.800
- our questions.
- Your Honor, the NDA covers

02:54.842 --> 02:57.136
what happened at the meeting
in Big Sur, which we believe

02:57.177 --> 02:59.179
to be completely irrelevant
to the matter at hand

02:59.221 --> 03:01.140
- and out of the scope of discovery.
- BILLY: Well, we don't know

03:01.181 --> 03:03.183
if it's irrelevant or not,
because we don't know

03:03.225 --> 03:04.935
the details of what happened.

03:04.977 --> 03:06.937
We propose
an evidentiary hearing,

get Mr. Blackwood in here,

if what happened in Big Sur
is relevant or not.

I'm sorry, Your Honor.

03:17.948 --> 03:20.576
Ms. Sen,

03:20.618 --> 03:24.747
why don't you explain to us
why it's a terrible idea?

03:24.788 --> 03:26.749
Yeah, maybe throw in a legal
reason or two while you're...

03:26.790 --> 03:28.584
- Mr. McBride. - I'm sorry.
- Your Honor,

03:28.626 --> 03:31.128
Mr. McBride is simply using
his current lawsuit,

03:31.170 --> 03:33.047
this illegally solicited
class action...

03:33.088 --> 03:35.174
That's not true. And sanctioned
by this very court.

03:35.215 --> 03:37.009
Mr. McBride is using this case

03:37.051 --> 03:39.053
to go on a fishing expedition
for his next one.

03:39.094 --> 03:42.765
Well, if the court decides
that your client's testimony

03:42.806 --> 03:46.101
is not relevant, you can keep
your little secrets.

03:46.143 --> 03:48.228
We're talking about legally

a secret handshake

03:49.980 --> 03:51.982
to access
the clubhouse out back.

03:52.024 --> 03:54.109
Your Honor, if the defense
denies us access

03:54.151 --> 03:56.695
to the information
protected by the NDA,

03:56.737 --> 03:58.948
then I'm going to need
a continuance. Maybe even two.

dragging on for months,

04:01.700 --> 04:06.205

I hope he doesn't do that.

04:34.316 --> 04:36.360
SUMI: It's possible the
judge will rule in our favor,

04:36.402 --> 04:39.363
and everything you say in court
tomorrow will be inadmissible.

04:39.405 --> 04:41.115

04:54.712 --> 04:58.257
Billy McBride is going to ask
you who signed NDAs.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.093
So what's wrong with that?

05:01.135 --> 05:03.095
Then he's going to ask you,

05:03.137 --> 05:06.932
"Was there anyone else in
the room who didn't sign NDAs?"

05:06.974 --> 05:09.518
How honest do I have to be?

05:09.560 --> 05:12.604
Here's the risk:
if you're not completely honest,

05:12.646 --> 05:15.733
and you don't mention Diana,
you'll perjure yourself.

05:15.774 --> 05:19.111
- I can't undo perjury.
- (GROANS)

05:19.153 --> 05:22.072
- Diana will be exposed.
- And vulnerable.

05:22.156 --> 05:24.658
Why didn't you have her
sign an NDA?

05:24.700 --> 05:27.786
Because I wanted to protect her,
and, at the time,

05:27.828 --> 05:30.497
I didn't want any evidence
that she was even there.

05:30.539 --> 05:33.333
I understand how, 11 years ago,
that could've made sense.

05:33.375 --> 05:35.961
Nobody had a crystal ball
and could predict

05:36.003 --> 05:38.380
that we would be here, now,
but here we are.

05:38.422 --> 05:41.717
Huh. What happens if I say
that she was there?

05:41.759 --> 05:45.429
It becomes a risk
not bound by law.

05:45.471 --> 05:48.474
Uh, so...

05:48.515 --> 05:52.227
then she can either keep
her fucking mouth shut,

05:52.269 --> 05:56.482
or she can run to Billy
and put me up the river.

05:56.523 --> 05:58.108
How much are you willing to risk

05:58.150 --> 06:00.861
on the strength
of your relationship?

06:02.988 --> 06:05.115
Shit.

06:07.785 --> 06:11.288
It appears
as if I've painted myself

06:11.330 --> 06:13.332
into a fucking pickle.

06:15.667 --> 06:20.631
If the judge does not rule
in our favor,

06:20.672 --> 06:24.134
then Billy has
everything he needs.

06:24.176 --> 06:26.136
And if the judge does rule
in our favor,

06:26.178 --> 06:28.722
Billy could still get
everything he needs.

06:28.764 --> 06:32.351
So it all comes down
to me and Diana.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.853
How much we trust each other.

06:34.895 --> 06:38.315
Wade, you should be scared.

06:38.357 --> 06:42.945
Why? She could've already gone
running to Billy.

06:42.986 --> 06:46.406
You should be asking yourself
why she hasn't.

06:46.448 --> 06:49.076
What is she waiting for?

06:51.120 --> 06:53.330

opportunity has come up,

I thought of you first.

- Why wouldn't I?

I, uh... but I'm flattered.

at the business plan,

and of course the prospectus,
and, uh...

08:30.969 --> 08:33.304

11:46.498 --> 11:48.625
Any objections, Mr. McBride?

11:48.667 --> 11:50.085
No, Your Honor.

11:51.753 --> 11:53.505
Um....

11:53.547 --> 11:55.841
- What?
- (QUIETLY): It's okay.

11:55.882 --> 11:58.093
I want her to hear what he says.

11:58.135 --> 12:00.512
- Okay?
- Okay.

12:00.554 --> 12:02.514
Good morning, Mr. Blackwood.

12:02.556 --> 12:05.684
- Morning.
- I just want to remind you

12:05.725 --> 12:08.019
that anything you say is under
the penalty of perjury.

12:08.061 --> 12:10.230
SUMI: Objection.
Mr. Blackwood knows

12:10.272 --> 12:11.440
he's under oath.
He just took it.

12:11.481 --> 12:13.442
Let's move it along,
Mr. McBride.

12:13.483 --> 12:14.860
BILLY: Yes, Your Honor.

12:14.901 --> 12:16.528
Uh, just one more thing.

12:16.570 --> 12:18.155
You can plead the Fifth,
if you committed any crimes

12:18.196 --> 12:19.698
you'd rather not admit to.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.908
- That won't be a problem.
- Okay, good.

12:21.950 --> 12:23.076
How much are you worth?

12:23.118 --> 12:24.703
Why don't you tell me?

12:24.744 --> 12:26.955
Okay, I will.
Two billion dollars.

12:26.997 --> 12:28.999
Two billion? Fair enough.

12:29.040 --> 12:30.542
Okay.

12:30.584 --> 12:32.794
How much land do you own
in the Central Valley?

12:32.836 --> 12:37.883
About... 200,000 acres.

12:37.924 --> 12:39.885
Objection. Where is this going?

12:39.926 --> 12:41.928
I'm just laying
a little groundwork, ma'am.

12:41.970 --> 12:44.139
- Lay it a little quicker, Mr. McBride.
- Yes, Your Honor.

12:44.181 --> 12:46.224
- Thank you.
- So, 200,000 acres.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.684
Okay, so I'm no mathematician,

12:47.726 --> 12:50.103
but I think
that's right at about...

12:50.145 --> 12:52.564
300 square miles,
something like that?

12:52.606 --> 12:55.025
- Sounds about right.
- What do you grow?

12:55.066 --> 12:57.903
- Almonds.
- How much water do you use per year?

12:57.944 --> 12:59.529
About, uh...

12:59.571 --> 13:03.283
400,000 acre-feet.

13:03.325 --> 13:04.993
(CHUCKLES): Wow.

13:05.035 --> 13:06.453
That's more than two-thirds

13:06.495 --> 13:08.580
of what the entire city
of Los Angeles uses.

13:08.622 --> 13:10.624
Objection.
Counsel is testifying.

13:10.665 --> 13:12.667
- (CLEARS THROAT)
- BILLY: I'm sorry. My apologies, Your Honor.

13:12.709 --> 13:14.711
That was just
kind of overwhelming

13:14.753 --> 13:16.880
to hear that figure,
and I-I-I just blurted it out.

13:16.922 --> 13:17.923
You can strike that
from the record.

13:17.964 --> 13:19.341
PAXTON: Noted.

13:19.382 --> 13:21.384
Approximately how many
almond trees do you have?

13:21.426 --> 13:24.012
I figure...
(EXHALES)

13:24.054 --> 13:26.640
...ten million,

13:26.681 --> 13:29.309
over 160,000 acres.

13:29.351 --> 13:30.560
And how much is that worth?

13:30.602 --> 13:33.146
D-Depending on the market, um...

13:33.188 --> 13:36.816
a-around, uh, 800 million.

13:36.858 --> 13:39.528
- That's a lot of nuts.
- Dollars.

13:39.569 --> 13:40.946
BILLY: I read somewhere that
it takes a gallon of water

13:40.987 --> 13:43.240
to grow one almond;
is that right?

13:43.281 --> 13:44.491
I've... I've never done the math.

13:44.533 --> 13:47.244
Why does it take so much water?

13:47.285 --> 13:48.828
Almonds are a permanent crop.

13:48.870 --> 13:50.914
They need to be watered
year round or they will die.

13:50.956 --> 13:52.040
Objection.
Are we there yet?

13:52.082 --> 13:53.166
We're there.

13:53.208 --> 13:55.168
During the last record drought,

13:55.210 --> 13:57.170
the State of California
cut your water deliveries.

13:57.212 --> 13:59.256
Must have destroyed
a lot of your crop.

13:59.297 --> 14:01.550
Well, that was
a while back, um...

14:01.591 --> 14:04.386
I believe we had
to rip out 40,000 acres

14:04.427 --> 14:06.012
of perfectly healthy trees

14:06.054 --> 14:07.347
because we just
couldn't water them.

14:07.389 --> 14:08.848
Probably cost you
a lot of money.

14:08.890 --> 14:10.517
- Oh, yeah.
- Because the state of California

14:10.559 --> 14:13.019
cut your water deliveries
during the drought.

14:13.061 --> 14:14.896
- Yes.
- Was the state

14:14.938 --> 14:16.606
- in breach of contract?
- Yes.

14:16.648 --> 14:18.567
And you threatened to sue the
state for breach of contract.

14:18.608 --> 14:19.818
Oh, yes.

14:19.859 --> 14:20.819
And how did the state
react to that?

14:20.860 --> 14:23.613
We made a deal.

14:23.655 --> 14:26.533
A deal that give you control
over the newly constructed

14:26.575 --> 14:28.285
$98 million water bank

14:28.326 --> 14:29.786
right here in
Blackwood County, right?

14:29.828 --> 14:32.330
- Yes.
- So, the state of California's

14:32.372 --> 14:34.416
entire surplus of water
is just sitting there

14:34.457 --> 14:35.834
underground in an aquifer,
a water bank,

14:35.875 --> 14:37.294
right at your feet?

14:37.335 --> 14:39.671
- Yes.
- That was very kind of them, wasn't it?

14:39.713 --> 14:42.757
The state recognized
how valuable

14:42.799 --> 14:46.386
the Central Valley's agriculture
was to the California economy.

14:46.428 --> 14:48.221
So when you threatened to sue
the state of California,

14:48.263 --> 14:50.599
they came to you, knowing how
important your almond crop is

14:50.640 --> 14:53.351
to the economy,
and just gifted you the entire

14:53.393 --> 14:55.020
state of California's
surplus of water?

14:55.061 --> 14:58.440
No. No, I approached them.

14:58.481 --> 15:00.275
Oh. You went to them?

15:00.317 --> 15:03.320
- Mm-hmm. Yes.
- Oh.

15:03.361 --> 15:05.655
Well, originally you said
they came to you.

15:08.199 --> 15:10.410
My mistake.
I misspoke.

15:10.452 --> 15:12.203
Don't make that mistake again.

15:12.245 --> 15:14.080
Understood.

15:14.122 --> 15:15.540
Who did you go to
from the state?

15:15.582 --> 15:18.835
The deputy director
of the State Water Department.

15:18.877 --> 15:20.629
Spencer Jackson.

15:20.670 --> 15:23.590
So, you were given control
of the state water bank.

15:23.632 --> 15:25.675
What was Spencer Jackson
given in return?

15:25.717 --> 15:28.470
(CHUCKLES)
A whole lot of money.

15:28.511 --> 15:30.680
Your Honor, may I have
a moment with my client?

15:30.722 --> 15:32.891
PAXTON: No. Let me.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.434
Mr. Blackwood,

15:34.476 --> 15:37.812
you are aware that
you can plead the Fifth

15:37.854 --> 15:41.441
in order to avoid
implicating yourself in a crime?

15:41.483 --> 15:42.442
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

15:42.484 --> 15:44.235
But I am a businessman.

15:44.277 --> 15:46.863
I am also a concerned citizen
with a vested interest

15:46.905 --> 15:49.115
in Mr. Jackson's
political career.

15:49.157 --> 15:51.951
So you bribed Mr. Jackson
to give you the water bank,

15:51.993 --> 15:53.828
and then you had him sign
an NDA to cover it up.

15:53.870 --> 15:57.290
They were not bribes,
they were political donations.

15:57.332 --> 15:58.875
And it's all legal.

15:58.917 --> 16:01.544
And if you don't like it,
you can complain to Congress.

16:01.586 --> 16:03.296
(CHUCKLES)

16:03.338 --> 16:05.340
It's good to be rich,
isn't it, Mr. Blackwood?

16:05.382 --> 16:06.966
Well, I've been rich
and I've been poor,

16:07.008 --> 16:09.135
and believe me, rich is better.

16:09.177 --> 16:11.721
So, this arrangement,
this deal that was made,

16:11.763 --> 16:14.724
this was the meeting that was
held in 2008 in Big Sur?

16:14.766 --> 16:16.059
BLACKWOOD: Yes.

16:16.101 --> 16:18.561
- The Big Sur agreement?
- Yes, sir.

16:18.603 --> 16:20.980
Did everyone at that meeting
sign an NDA?

16:23.233 --> 16:25.860
- No.
- BILLY: No?

16:25.902 --> 16:28.863
No. My assistant,
Ms. Summers.

16:28.905 --> 16:31.991
She signed the NDA, but she was
not part of the agreement.

16:32.033 --> 16:33.660
- BILLY: Dolores Summers?
- Mm-hmm.

16:33.702 --> 16:35.286
I understand that she doesn't
work for you anymore.

16:35.328 --> 16:37.414
- Why is that?
- She quit.

16:37.455 --> 16:39.082
I wonder why she would do that.

16:39.124 --> 16:41.209
I wonder why people do anything.

16:41.251 --> 16:43.336
So, in other words,
you have no idea.

16:43.378 --> 16:46.715
- Yes. I don't.
- Can you tell us

16:46.756 --> 16:49.509
everyone who signed an NDA
who was at the meeting

16:49.551 --> 16:51.636
in Big Sur in 2008?

16:51.678 --> 16:55.348
Myself, Mr. Jackson,
Ms. Summers, Roy Wheeler,

16:55.390 --> 16:59.811
Gerry Kernen, Warren Hebb...

16:59.853 --> 17:01.604
and Marisol Silva.

17:01.646 --> 17:04.357
- Marisol Silva?
- Mm-hmm.

17:04.398 --> 17:06.776
As in the mayor of Los Angeles?

17:06.818 --> 17:08.194
That Marisol Silva?

17:08.236 --> 17:09.945
Oh, she wasn't mayor
at the time.

17:09.988 --> 17:13.575
She was a city councilwoman
representing the Los Angeles

17:13.616 --> 17:15.743
Metropolitan Water District.

17:15.785 --> 17:17.036
BILLY: In an official capacity?

17:17.078 --> 17:18.371
Because there's no record

17:18.413 --> 17:19.873
of Ms. Silva's involvement

17:19.914 --> 17:21.750
in the L.A. County
Metro Water District.

17:21.790 --> 17:25.795
All I know is that
she took care of it.

17:25.837 --> 17:27.547
I guess you'd have to ask her.

17:27.589 --> 17:29.758
I'd love to ask her,
but I can't, can I?

17:29.799 --> 17:31.092
Because of the NDA.

17:31.134 --> 17:33.011
Well, if this hearing
goes your way,

17:33.052 --> 17:34.804
you can ask her
anything you want.

17:34.846 --> 17:38.600
But I believe that everything
about the Big Sur agreement

17:38.641 --> 17:40.143
is legal.

17:40.185 --> 17:44.314
The right people signed
the right pieces of paper.

17:44.355 --> 17:46.566
- For a price.
- Still legal.

17:46.608 --> 17:48.234
So you just woke up
one morning and thought,

17:48.276 --> 17:51.112
"I'm gonna rob the state
of California's water bank,

17:51.154 --> 17:53.948
"and I'm gonna deny the citizens
of Blackwood County

17:53.990 --> 17:55.825
"their share of water
because the water bank is

17:55.867 --> 17:57.994
"right here in Blackwood County,
my name is Blackwood,

17:58.036 --> 18:00.079
so I figure it's mine"?
Is that about it?

18:00.121 --> 18:02.415
- Objection! Was that even a question?
- Yes, it was.

18:02.457 --> 18:04.417
Sustained.

18:04.459 --> 18:07.170
Mr. McBride, move on.

18:07.212 --> 18:09.672
Okay, I'll rephrase it.

18:09.714 --> 18:12.342
Once you gained control
of the water bank,

18:12.383 --> 18:15.345
did you, as president of the
Blackwood County Water Board,

18:15.386 --> 18:17.639
decide to cut off
the residents' water

18:17.680 --> 18:20.975
in order to keep the
Tall Grass Farming Company,

18:21.017 --> 18:23.394
your billion-dollar
agricultural conglomerate,

18:23.436 --> 18:24.813
profitable?

18:24.854 --> 18:27.232
All perfectly legal.

18:27.273 --> 18:28.900
Well, I think we should
let a jury decide

18:28.942 --> 18:31.069
if what you did was
perfectly legal.

18:31.110 --> 18:34.489
Essentially, you privatized
a public resource

18:34.531 --> 18:35.865
for your own financial gain.

18:35.907 --> 18:38.076
I think they may see it
differently than you.

18:38.117 --> 18:41.079
Objection. Does Mr. McBride have
any actual questions,

18:41.120 --> 18:43.331
- or are we done here?
- Sustained.

18:43.373 --> 18:45.542
Is there anything else,
Mr. McBride?

18:45.583 --> 18:46.793
BILLY: There is.

18:46.835 --> 18:49.796
I got one more thing here.

18:57.387 --> 18:59.848
Was this picture taken
at the Big Sur meeting?

19:12.402 --> 19:14.028
Yes.

19:14.070 --> 19:18.241
Okay. Was that before or after
the NDAs were signed?

19:22.412 --> 19:23.788
After, I think.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.957
So it was kind of like
a celebration?

19:25.999 --> 19:28.334
Objection. This is the first
time I've seen that photo.

19:28.376 --> 19:30.670
I'm just trying to authenticate
the picture, Your Honor.

19:30.712 --> 19:34.132
Overruled.
You can continue.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.676
Thank you, Your Honor.
Who took this picture,

19:36.718 --> 19:38.094
Mr. Blackwood?

19:38.136 --> 19:40.138
Hmm.

19:41.431 --> 19:43.641
I don't recall.

19:43.683 --> 19:45.727
Hmm. Okay, let's go down
the list here.

19:45.768 --> 19:47.812
Can we eliminate the four people
in the picture,

19:47.854 --> 19:49.314
or did you have one of those
little fancy timers

19:49.355 --> 19:51.065
where you set it and
run over there real quick,

19:51.107 --> 19:52.317
or something like that, did you?

19:52.358 --> 19:54.736
I think we can eliminate
the four of us.

19:54.777 --> 19:56.654
Okay, so we can eliminate
the four of you.

19:56.696 --> 20:00.074
That leaves three options:
Mr. Jackson, Ms. Silva

20:00.116 --> 20:02.285
and Ms. Summers;
does that ring a bell?

20:02.327 --> 20:04.203
Jog your memory a little bit?

20:04.245 --> 20:07.624
Well, actually,
it doesn't really matter

20:07.665 --> 20:09.042
if you remember or not,
because we could

20:09.083 --> 20:10.710
just get all three of 'em
in here,

20:10.752 --> 20:12.545
and we can put 'em on the stand,
and they can tell the court

20:12.587 --> 20:13.755
who took the picture.

20:13.796 --> 20:15.340
Hey...

20:17.091 --> 20:19.594
...it was my sister, Diana.

20:27.060 --> 20:31.064
BILLY: Hmm. Okay.

20:31.105 --> 20:32.315
So your sister Diana
took the picture.

20:32.357 --> 20:35.360
- Did she sign an NDA?
- No.

20:35.401 --> 20:37.779
- But she was at the meeting?
- Yes.

20:37.820 --> 20:39.113
So I could put her on the stand,

20:39.155 --> 20:40.740
and she could testify
to everything

20:40.782 --> 20:42.283
that was done and said
in that meeting in Big Sur?

20:42.325 --> 20:45.036
Everything covered by your NDA.

20:47.121 --> 20:49.415
- I'm not a lawyer.
- Oh, I know that.

20:49.457 --> 20:51.334
But I am.
The answer is yes.

20:51.376 --> 20:53.461
And let me ask you
something else.

20:53.503 --> 20:54.879
Why did you not make her
sign an NDA?

20:54.921 --> 20:57.715
Objection.
This has gone on far too long.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.717
What happened at Big Sur
11 years ago,

20:59.759 --> 21:02.053
and who signed an NDA
or not and why,

21:02.095 --> 21:04.681
clearly has nothing to do
with Mr. McBride's clients,

21:04.722 --> 21:06.182
and why they don't have
water today.

21:06.224 --> 21:09.018
Sustained.

21:09.060 --> 21:12.021
If you don't have
anything else, Mr. McBride,

21:12.063 --> 21:14.899
I have heard enough
to make my decision.

21:14.941 --> 21:16.818
I'm sorry, Your Honor?

21:16.859 --> 21:20.154
Do you have anything else, or
would you like me to rule now?

21:20.196 --> 21:24.033
Okay. Well, I do have
something to add.

21:28.871 --> 21:32.709
Your Honor, I-if there's
one place in America

21:32.750 --> 21:34.460
where the powerless
and unprotected

21:34.502 --> 21:38.172
should be able to come
to find justice...

21:38.214 --> 21:40.466
it should be right here
in a court of law.

21:40.508 --> 21:41.968
So, before you make
your decision,

21:42.010 --> 21:44.554
I just want you
to consider this.

21:44.595 --> 21:47.306
We're living in a time
of record inequality.

21:47.348 --> 21:49.517
The top one percent
is wealthier than

21:49.559 --> 21:54.731
the bottom 90% combined.

21:54.772 --> 21:56.899
I mean, Mr. Blackwood
just explained that

21:56.941 --> 22:01.487
when the state had to cut back
on his water delivery,

22:01.529 --> 22:02.989
he used his privilege
and his wealth

22:03.031 --> 22:06.659
to gain control of
a $100 million water bank,

22:06.701 --> 22:10.079
and all the state's surplus
of water in return.

22:10.121 --> 22:12.331
And where does that leave
my clients?

22:13.916 --> 22:17.420
Where does it leave
any of the 90%, or the 99%?

22:17.462 --> 22:21.382
They're-they're not looking
to become multibillionaires.

22:21.424 --> 22:24.052
They just want a drink of water.

22:24.093 --> 22:26.137
In a perfect world...
(CHUCKLES)

22:26.179 --> 22:28.306
...this is where
we find the truth.

22:28.347 --> 22:32.643
And the truth is
people are suffering.

22:32.685 --> 22:37.023
So, I-I'm just asking you...

22:37.065 --> 22:40.109
when you're considering this...

22:40.151 --> 22:44.697
to be fair and just to the 90%.

22:44.739 --> 22:47.700
And the 99%.

22:50.495 --> 22:52.914
And don't let it become
white noise to you.

22:57.043 --> 22:59.045
You know...

23:03.800 --> 23:05.760
MARISOL: In our short time in office,

23:05.802 --> 23:08.137
we have sought to restore
integrity

23:08.179 --> 23:10.223
and accountability to City Hall.

23:10.264 --> 23:13.684
But we cannot rest
on our accomplishments,

23:13.726 --> 23:17.313
because the world is looking
to us for leadership

23:17.355 --> 23:19.357
and energy and imagination.

23:19.398 --> 23:22.443
Because Los Angeles has
always been an innovator.

23:22.485 --> 23:24.445
We can and we must

23:24.487 --> 23:28.116
harness the unbelievable
capital of this city

23:28.157 --> 23:30.868
to tackle the issues...
Homelessness, inequality

23:30.910 --> 23:33.830
and the consequences
of a warming planet.

23:33.871 --> 23:35.957
But it's not just business
and political leaders

23:35.998 --> 23:37.792
that are leading
the way forward.

23:37.834 --> 23:39.877
It's all of you.

23:39.919 --> 23:42.380
As I spend time
with students like you,

23:42.421 --> 23:45.007
I find inspiration
in your energy

23:45.049 --> 23:47.468
and commitment
to making Los Angeles

23:47.510 --> 23:51.305
and California the leader in the
progressive infrastructures...

23:53.266 --> 23:57.353
...that will serve and protect
our delicate environment

23:57.395 --> 23:59.230
for years to come.

23:59.272 --> 24:03.234
The country is looking for you,
the future leaders,

24:03.276 --> 24:07.363
to be active and engaged
on the local level.

24:07.405 --> 24:10.700
It's your local engagement
that will inspire the change

24:10.741 --> 24:12.034
our government needs.

24:12.076 --> 24:15.288
So, pay attention, get loud,

24:15.329 --> 24:19.584
and you will begin to see
the change this country needs

24:19.625 --> 24:22.044
to move forward.
Thank you.

do that, do you? Hmm?

you need to do?

Go ahead, go read a book.

24:49.989 --> 24:52.491

as is everything that has to do

25:31.447 --> 25:32.698
with the meeting in Big Sur.

25:32.740 --> 25:34.325
What do you mean, it's out?

25:34.367 --> 25:37.495
It's not relevant
to your case, Ms. Papagian.

25:37.536 --> 25:40.289
How the defendants got
possession of the water bank,

25:40.331 --> 25:44.252
no matter how disgusting,
has nothing to do with

25:44.293 --> 25:46.045

25:46.087 --> 25:47.338
(PATTY GROANS)

25:47.380 --> 25:49.840
So you're in Blackwood's pocket
now, too, huh?

25:49.882 --> 25:51.801
Watch it, Mr. McBride.

25:51.842 --> 25:54.011
You made your point in there
and you got my attention.

25:54.053 --> 25:55.596
Congratulations.

25:55.638 --> 25:58.307
But what do you want me
to do with that testimony, hmm?

25:58.349 --> 26:01.352
I can't put it
in front of a jury.

26:01.394 --> 26:04.021
Not only is it irrelevant,

26:04.063 --> 26:06.816
it is highly prejudicial.

26:06.857 --> 26:08.025
Well, of course
it's highly prejudicial.

26:08.067 --> 26:09.360
That's why we're suing him.

26:09.402 --> 26:11.696
Given the nature
of Mr. Blackwood's testimony,

26:11.737 --> 26:13.614
we'd like to have
the transcript sealed.

26:13.656 --> 26:15.074
PAXTON: Granted.

26:15.116 --> 26:17.243
- Really?!
- Really.

26:17.285 --> 26:20.204
And we're asking the court
to issue a protective measure

26:20.246 --> 26:22.832
preventing any further
disclosure under the NDA.

26:22.873 --> 26:25.376
- Granted.
- So you're gonna leave us

26:25.418 --> 26:27.420
with absolutely nothing,
is that it?

26:27.461 --> 26:30.548
Mr. McBride, you came here
with nothing;

26:30.589 --> 26:35.386
and you've done nothing
but waste my time and Ms. Sen's.

26:35.428 --> 26:38.431
Speaking of which, I normally
don't like to do this,

26:38.472 --> 26:41.851
but Mr. Cooperman has insisted
the plaintiffs be responsible

26:41.892 --> 26:43.477
- for our costs.
- (GASPS)

26:43.519 --> 26:45.187
Granted.

26:45.229 --> 26:48.107
Mr. McBride,
you're hereby notified

26:48.149 --> 26:49.734
that you're responsible
for Mr. Blackwood's

26:49.775 --> 26:51.235

26:51.277 --> 26:52.778
Can we be heard at all,

26:52.820 --> 26:54.155
or has this become
a private transaction

26:54.196 --> 26:55.990
between you and Blackwood?

26:56.032 --> 26:58.367
I have heard enough from you,
Mr. McBride.

26:58.409 --> 27:01.162
And you're not helping yourself.

27:01.203 --> 27:03.956
SUMI: And finally,
we're moving for summary judgment.

27:03.998 --> 27:06.834
As Mr. McBride himself
has noted,

27:06.876 --> 27:09.754
he no longer has any evidence
supporting any of his claims.

27:09.795 --> 27:11.672
There is no case left.

27:15.843 --> 27:19.764
Mr. McBride, you have two weeks
to find something,

27:19.805 --> 27:24.393
or I'll have no choice but
to rule in favor of the defense.

27:24.435 --> 27:25.936
And if you don't like that,

27:25.978 --> 27:29.148
well, then you can take it up
on appeal then.

27:29.190 --> 27:31.150
There's no time for appeals.

27:31.192 --> 27:34.445
It'll drag on for 20 years

28:26.414 --> 28:28.666
is why is she always

28:28.707 --> 28:30.292

with it, huh?

28:30.334 --> 28:31.877
We don't have any evidence
against her.

to stealing our water?

- Son of a bitch, he admitted it.
- I didn't say that.
