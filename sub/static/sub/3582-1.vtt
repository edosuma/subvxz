01:03.400 --> 01:07.200
Isn't there's a new employee, young handsome guy?

01:07.600 --> 01:08.600
He's far more younger than you.

01:08.600 --> 01:11.000
He's not a permanent. Will only last few months before quitting.

01:11.600 --> 01:12.600
Really?

01:16.200 --> 01:17.200
What's the fun of it?

01:17.750 --> 01:19.400
This isn't a drama,
why he's being so serious?

01:19.400 --> 01:21.500
The first week you start working here, you said fun too..

01:22.400 --> 01:23.500
Yeah, I did.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.500
Why he needs to wear the sunglasses?

01:26.850 --> 01:28.400
Heard that his eyes hurt so badly.

01:31.700 --> 01:33.200
It's a sickness.

01:38.200 --> 01:39.200
Hey isn't that this one?

01:42.500 --> 01:43.700
This guy right?

01:44.500 --> 01:45.500
It seems so.

01:45.800 --> 01:46.900
He's alone.

02:01.200 --> 02:03.000

Standby! Standby!
Suspect disappeared.

02:29.500 --> 02:30.500
"Unit 3, arrived in Pil-Un ..."

<i>Alright</i>

02:38.000 --> 02:39.700

02:42.100 --> 02:43.700
"What if they escape?"

02:43.700 --> 02:47.700
"If we move now we'll leave a hole.
Wait while watching"

02:48.200 --> 02:49.700

02:49.900 --> 02:51.900
<i>Now, still hasn't confirmed.
Keep standby!</i>

02:54.200 --> 02:55.200
He's there.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.700
"Standby.

03:07.400 --> 03:08.700

"Unit 3 standby."

03:16.500 --> 03:17.800
What are you trying to do now?

<i>Neither a person with superpower</i>

<i>Just...</i>

04:00.400 --> 04:02.000
...<i>a patiend.
A patient.</i>

04:06.000 --> 04:09.500
<i>During the sport festival elementary school class 5.</i>

04:13.400 --> 04:15.800
<i>Do you know where I'm running so fast to?</i>

04:17.200 --> 04:18.399
<i>Towards Bong Soo Mi.</i>

04:20.399 --> 04:21.800
<i>My Bong Soo Mi.</i>

04:25.700 --> 04:27.200
<i>Suddenly Bong Soo Mi's hand that stretched ...</i>

04:28.200 --> 04:29.200
<i>...and her lips...</i>

04:29.200 --> 04:31.000
<i>...moving very slow ...</i>

04:33.100 --> 04:34.900
<i>Also appa who looked overly-happy</i>

04:35.100 --> 04:36.100
<i>Omma...</i>

04:36.100 --> 04:40.100
<i>And also my dongsaeng </i>
<i>[Dongsaeng is sister in Korean]</i>

04:41.400 --> 04:43.200
<i>I really want to run towards Bong Soo Mi ...</i>

04:43.500 --> 04:47.200
<i> I really do want to run towards her and held her stretched hands.</i>

04:47.900 --> 04:50.300
<i>But my body kept falling ...</i>

05:03.100 --> 05:04.100
<i>How many? And how many?</i>

05:04.100 --> 05:05.100
<i>Two and three</i>

05:06.900 --> 05:08.100
<i>It's like that!</i>

05:08.100 --> 05:09.300
<i>So means to say...</i>

05:09.900 --> 05:11.300
<i>Yeah! Also faster!</i>

05:12.000 --> 05:13.300
<i>This! This! This!</i>

05:13.300 --> 05:14.800
<i>Seven, bird, and this side</i>

05:16.100 --> 05:17.900
<i>Condition like this.
I've seen only in the book.</i>

05:18.900 --> 05:19.900
<i>It is called Dynamic Acuity.</i>

05:19.900 --> 05:21.900
<i>It's an ability to see functional activities from an object.</i>

05:21.900 --> 05:23.900
<i>His ability in this case is really great.
Really great.</i>

05:25.200 --> 05:26.500
<i>Also it's not always like that</i>

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
<i>Once they have such feelings.</i>

05:30.800 --> 05:32.000
<i>The moment they concentrate it will become like this.</i>

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
<i>I do concentrate in staring at Bong Soo Mi.</i>

05:34.600 --> 05:36.000
<i>Everyday... greatly</i>

05:46.000 --> 05:47.200
<i>Let him be a baseball player</i>

05:48.000 --> 05:50.800
<i>When he stare at the ball, the ball will move very slow. The ball will be hit accurately</i>

05:51.700 --> 05:52.800
<i>Slow video, you know right?</i>

05:52.800 --> 05:56.600
<i>So to say that he has the ability like slow video data.</i>

05:56.600 --> 05:57.600
<i>Like this.</i>

06:01.300 --> 06:02.000
<i>Like this.</i>

06:02.000 --> 06:02.300
<i>S.T.R.I.K.E. ... Like thi.s</i>
<i>Like this.</i>

06:02.300 --> 06:05.300
<i>S.T.R.I.K.E. ... Like this</i>

06:06.000 --> 06:07.400
<i>So, why do I fall when running?</i>

06:08.600 --> 06:09.600
<i>Dizziness.</i>

06:09.800 --> 06:12.200
<i>Why when running his eyes looks like this?</i>

06:12.200 --> 06:13.600
<i>Automatically it will become one.</i>

06:14.800 --> 06:17.400
<i>The body is running but the mind's thinking that 'ah, he's running.</i>

06:17.900 --> 06:20.100
<i>But the visual information that seen by the eyes? How?</i>

06:20.600 --> 06:21.800
<i>Will slow down.</i>

06:21.800 --> 06:23.600
<i>And the mind...</i>

06:23.800 --> 06:24.800
<i>"Ah? I'm running right?</i>

06:25.800 --> 06:27.000
<i>And it becomes confuse.</i>

06:27.800 --> 06:29.600
<i>It's still okay to drive a car or motor.</i>

06:29.600 --> 06:31.600
<i>But if you want to run, you can't help it</i>

06:33.200 --> 06:35.800
<i>That is why, he can't play baseball either.</i>

06:40.900 --> 06:42.900
<i>To summarized...</i>

06:42.900 --> 06:44.900
<i>Your eyes are too good, that is why you can't run.</i>

06:48.900 --> 06:49.900
<i>Like this, we observe first.</i>

06:52.200 --> 06:53.400
<i>If the eyes becomes too glare.</i>

06:53.400 --> 06:54.900
<i>Maybe it'll be more dizzy.
That is why.</i>

06:57.400 --> 06:59.200
<i>Appa promised to solve this mater.</i>

06:59.800 --> 07:01.600
<i>For the sake of curing my weird sight...</i>

07:01.800 --> 07:04.000
<i>...appa works at a place that's very faraway to find money.</i>

07:04.800 --> 07:08.600
<i>Due to my eyes, I'm separated from appa.
It's very sad, but ...</i>

07:18.500 --> 07:19.900
<i>...there's a blessing behind that.</i>

07:21.000 --> 07:22.400
<i>Scene that slowed down...</i>

07:22.500 --> 07:23.900
<i>... give a deep impression.</i>

07:24.200 --> 07:26.500
<i>... and will produce artistic inspiration.</i>

07:27.800 --> 07:28.800
<i>But...</i>

07:29.700 --> 07:32.500
<i> The kids think my eyes are aliens' eyes.</i>

07:33.300 --> 07:34.500
<i>Like this</i>

07:35.100 --> 07:36.500
<i>Also like this</i>

07:50.000 --> 07:52.400
<i>Bong Soo Mi becomes my only friend.</i>

07:56.000 --> 07:58.400
<i>Spring that greets my life.</i>

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
<i>Also artistic inspiration
Never stop flowing</i>

08:14.000 --> 08:18.000
<i>But soon, Soo Mi also get bullied by the neighborhood kids</i>

08:18.400 --> 08:22.000
<i>Only because she play with a creature with eyes disorder.</i>

08:23.000 --> 08:24.400
<i>The spring was too short.</i>

08:34.000 --> 08:35.400
<i>If only I'm able to run ...</i>

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
<i>I will not let Soo Mi left far me behind</i>

08:39.500 --> 08:41.000
<i>And because of my too good eyes ...</i>

08:41.200 --> 08:43.000
<i>... I can not run.</i>

08:44.800 --> 08:46.000
<i>Going to, going to</i>

08:47.000 --> 08:47.900
<i>Ya!</i>

08:57.700 --> 09:00.000
<i>To destroy my eyes, I watched television.</i>

09:01.100 --> 09:02.200
<i>But...</i>

09:03.100 --> 09:04.600
<i>Drama are really fun.</i>

09:06.800 --> 09:09.600
<i>In drama, there are many cool hyungs</i>

09:13.300 --> 09:14.800
<i>I learned all my lessons from those hyungs.</i>

09:16.000 --> 09:17.500
<i>How to talk...</i>

09:23.200 --> 09:24.700
<i>How to act...</i>

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
<i>Even though all those things I've leaned are worthless.</i>

09:35.800 --> 09:38.500
<i>In a year, beside two-three times visit to ophthalmology for eyes check up...</i>

09:38.600 --> 09:40.900
<i>There's no other reason to go outside.</i>

09:41.800 --> 09:43.600
<i>Never had friends come over to play.</i>

09:43.600 --> 09:45.900
<i>Also, there's no interest to play at a friend's place.</i>

09:56.200 --> 09:57.500
<i>Space inside the beauty salon.</i>

09:57.600 --> 09:59.600
<i>Are my only world.</i>

10:01.900 --> 10:03.300
<i>To save money for flight ticket ...</i>

10:03.500 --> 10:05.500
<i>...appa who refuse to come back even during holiday ...</i>

10:06.800 --> 10:10.300
<i>... finally passed away due an to accident at the work place</i>

10:11.600 --> 10:13.600
<i>Now, the only man that I know ...</i>

10:14.100 --> 10:15.700
<i>...is Dr Seok, opthalmology.</i>

10:18.300 --> 10:19.300
<i>Jang Boo-ah...</i>

10:19.500 --> 10:21.500
<i>This time, please think about this carefully uh...</i>

10:22.900 --> 10:26.300
<i>Before it's too late, you should go see world outside.</i>

10:27.250 --> 10:28.850
<i>The world are calling your name.</i>

10:28.950 --> 10:39.450
=[Slow Video]=

10:45.450 --> 10:47.250
<i>I've never  felt so curious about the people in this world.</i>

10:47.250 --> 10:49.750
<i>Towards real people who live outside the drama</i>

10:49.750 --> 10:51.750
<i>... and how they live</i>

10:53.250 --> 10:55.250
<i>But looking from here ...</i>

10:55.250 --> 10:57.950
<i>...their lives are similar with drama.</i>

11:03.000 --> 11:04.600
<i>Only thing that differ is ... </i>

11:04.600 --> 11:06.800
<i>...it's a live broadcast, which is not scripted.</i>

11:08.700 --> 11:10.400
<i>Also, there is no supporting actor either.</i>

11:12.850 --> 11:15.400
<i>They are all acting and are the main actors.</i>

11:16.800 --> 11:19.400
<i>All of them are main characters
for more than 200-ish episodes of drama.</i>

11:19.800 --> 11:21.600
<i>It's not boring at all.</i>

11:24.100 --> 11:26.600
<i>At night, those whom busy disappear.</i>

11:26.900 --> 11:28.900
<i>Those whom lonely, will be outside on the streets.</i>

11:30.400 --> 11:32.400
<i>A little boy who hiked the ramp alone everyday.</i>

11:33.100 --> 11:35.400
<i>And hyung who plays baseball alone everyday.</i>

11:37.800 --> 11:39.300
<i>... looking so lonely</i>

11:40.100 --> 11:41.500
<i>...feels like wanna accompany them.</i>

11:42.850 --> 11:44.650
<i>Will they hate me?</i>

11:45.150 --> 11:46.350
He looks like a person who doesn't have friends

11:47.350 --> 11:49.950
And doesn't like to talk.
Even if he does, it'll be very short

11:51.250 --> 11:53.050
He only talks with me. Heh!

11:56.350 --> 11:58.350
He talked alot with you, Dr Byung-nim?

11:59.550 --> 12:01.950
Maybe because I'm a bit professional

12:02.350 --> 12:04.550
And plus, from appearance and age ...

12:05.450 --> 12:07.850
Very similar. Maybe due those, he felt close

12:08.850 --> 12:10.050
It can be.

12:12.250 --> 12:14.350
He's a guy whom we got with a lot of hard work.

12:16.250 --> 12:18.350
Hope Dr Byung-nim will look after him.

12:18.550 --> 12:20.350
Yeah, don't worry too much.

12:21.250 --> 12:23.850
I'll take him as my successor and be responsible until the end.

12:23.850 --> 12:25.850
I'll take care of him carefully for this two years.

12:39.350 --> 12:40.350
What is this?

12:41.250 --> 12:42.650
Doesn't socialize or what?

12:42.650 --> 12:44.150
How crazy!

12:48.450 --> 12:50.050
<i>What are you doing?
Wait a minute!</i>

12:52.550 --> 12:53.950
What else he's trying to do?

13:01.250 --> 13:02.350
He --he's not throwing.

13:05.150 --> 13:06.550
Yo --you just pretend you don't see.

13:06.550 --> 13:08.550
Just pretend you don't see anything.
Come on, lets sit!

13:08.550 --> 13:10.550
Be natural.
What are you looking at?

13:11.450 --> 13:12.550
You're tired?

13:19.250 --> 13:23.250
13. 14. 15. 16.

13:23.250 --> 13:26.250
17. 18. 19. 20. 21.

13:30.350 --> 13:31.350
I also feel...

13:31.650 --> 13:34.050
... humans lives aren't too different from drama

13:34.050 --> 13:36.250
I have this mindset.

13:39.800 --> 13:44.000
There are so many monitors here. So even working you feel excited, right?

13:45.200 --> 13:47.000
Conceivably there's so many channels.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
Also...

13:49.500 --> 13:52.700
Must be a channel that you prefer. Absolutely, first class collection.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.300
Next time, I'll give you some.

13:56.700 --> 13:57.900
<i>Ajusshi...</i>

14:00.000 --> 14:01.800
<i>Later when we're that close, then we share.</i>

14:06.500 --> 14:07.700
I was just talking.

14:14.500 --> 14:20.000
1. 2. 3. 4. 5.
6. 7. 8. 9. 10.

14:23.700 --> 14:28.500
19. 20. 21. 22. 23. 24...

14:34.800 --> 14:36.200
Doing homework?

14:36.200 --> 14:39.600
<i>Aniyo.</i>
Kind of a test like that?

14:39.600 --> 14:41.600
<i>Aniyo.</i>
- Join the school training?

14:41.600 --> 14:43.000
<i>I am not joining the school training</i>

14:54.500 --> 14:55.700
He's up so early

14:57.300 --> 15:01.300
1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6...

15:02.000 --> 15:03.400
This seems...

15:03.700 --> 15:06.500
Like a map? Also kind of like a picture

15:08.400 --> 15:12.000
<i>Also this Ajusshi...
why doesn't he use 'banmal'?</i>
[Banmal is Korean informal way of speaking]

15:12.200 --> 15:13.200
<i>First impression is important.</i>

15:13.500 --> 15:15.100
<i>Need to be more strict.</i>

15:15.400 --> 15:16.900
Ajusshi-

15:18.900 --> 15:21.900
Ajusshi you...
where usually you like to go?

15:22.300 --> 15:23.700
In life.

15:25.500 --> 15:26.500
Me?

15:26.500 --> 15:27.600
<i>Finally...</i>

15:28.000 --> 15:29.400
<i>Start using banmal.</i>

15:29.500 --> 15:31.300
Usually I went to, wha-what's the name?

15:38.000 --> 15:39.600
Omma market.

15:40.800 --> 15:42.400
Omma cake shop.

15:43.100 --> 15:44.700
Omma bath house.

15:45.800 --> 15:47.200
Dongsaeng school.

15:49.500 --> 15:50.500
Wait a minute.

15:51.300 --> 15:52.700
Isn't you're missing something?

15:54.500 --> 15:57.500
Oh right! Girlfriend? You don't have girlfriend?

15:57.800 --> 15:59.200
Where's the girlfriend's house?

15:59.700 --> 16:00.700
<i>Girlfriend...</i>

16:01.000 --> 16:04.400
<i>Only cool hyungs have that.
Exist only in drama-land.</i>

16:06.800 --> 16:10.700
<i>But I also have someone, who come back in my memory.</i>

16:25.000 --> 16:26.800
Why? Need to go somewhere?

16:28.000 --> 16:29.600
Recently the weather are looking good, right?

16:29.600 --> 16:32.200
Autum. When their partner wanna go for a walk.

16:32.800 --> 16:34.100
Right? Haha.

17:07.800 --> 17:10.000
<i>She's always with the sunlight</i>

17:14.500 --> 17:15.300
Ya!

17:21.000 --> 17:22.200
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

17:22.200 --> 17:23.200
Ani, the interest.

17:23.800 --> 17:26.200
Isn't the collected rent have been paid direct to you?

17:26.200 --> 17:29.200
Exactly that! Anyway it should be handed to me.

17:30.100 --> 17:32.200
If you give the account number it can be settled already.

17:33.500 --> 17:36.000
Ajumoni, sorry. This is not that important.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.800
The rent should be paid.

17:39.500 --> 17:42.300
But once stripped if this house has a problem like this. The heart feels uneasy.

17:43.900 --> 17:44.900
I'm sorry.

17:46.800 --> 17:50.100
Ya, do you really need to disturb people this early?

17:50.200 --> 17:52.200
So, it's hard for you too right?

17:52.200 --> 17:54.600
I tried to settle it secretly for the sake of you too.

17:54.800 --> 17:56.800
Anyway, why only at this hour you go to work?

17:57.800 --> 17:59.400
Well, your eye crust looks pretty too?

18:01.300 --> 18:02.100
Ya!

18:02.300 --> 18:03.300
<i>Ya! Ya!</i>

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
Honorable tenant!

18:05.000 --> 18:07.500
The interest only, you can't afford to pay on time.

18:07.900 --> 18:11.500
Just sell the house, the bank loan and your debt with me will be settled.

18:12.650 --> 18:14.600
If it's true you late father do it for your sake.

18:14.600 --> 18:16.600
Giveaway the house and piled of debts to you, you should definitely ...

18:17.600 --> 18:20.200
Argh, really dirty! Is this a shadow or what?

18:21.800 --> 18:22.900
Do you know her?

18:23.300 --> 18:24.500
<i>It seems so.</i>

18:24.500 --> 18:26.300
<i>Standing under the sunlight...</i>

18:26.300 --> 18:27.500
<i>The same house too.</i>

18:27.800 --> 18:29.500
Do you borrow money from other too?

18:35.500 --> 18:36.900
What are you looking at?

18:39.800 --> 18:40.800
Really!

18:41.800 --> 18:43.200
Don't mind other people business.

18:43.800 --> 18:44.800
Tenant!

18:45.300 --> 18:46.900
<i>Or maybe not.</i>

20:07.600 --> 20:10.200
<i>Looking at the same thing she looked</i>

20:31.800 --> 20:33.800
<i>The kid that I saw at the CCTV Center,</i>

20:33.800 --> 20:35.800
<i>First time I saw him up close</i>

20:37.100 --> 20:40.500
<i>Do know, in this area,  you're the first person to be up so early?</i>

20:44.800 --> 20:45.800
<i>Nice to meet you!</i>

20:46.500 --> 20:48.500
<i>Hyung always watching you everyday.</i>

20:58.300 --> 21:00.300
<i>Ah, the hyung who plays baseball!</i>

21:11.700 --> 21:13.100
<i>It's actually easy to meet him.</i>

21:13.100 --> 21:15.100
<i>How can I show him that I'm pleased?</i>

21:25.400 --> 21:26.500
<i>Is it him?</i>

21:26.600 --> 21:27.900
Ya, crazy person!

21:29.500 --> 21:31.500
<i>I do that because I'm pleased to meet you</i>

21:32.000 --> 21:33.200
<i>I even being yelled at.</i>

21:33.200 --> 21:34.600
<i>You're the one who's crazy.</i>

22:10.000 --> 22:11.600
<i>Pil Un-dong?</i>

22:12.400 --> 22:14.000
110-044.

22:16.100 --> 22:18.100
<i>Sinmun-no, Il-ga.</i>

22:18.100 --> 22:20.100
110-062.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
Unni really has talent.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.200
Talent huh?

22:25.000 --> 22:26.400
Talent of doing part time works.

22:27.500 --> 22:29.000
[Don't be late!]

22:29.000 --> 22:30.650
<i>Your age is a bit old.</i>

22:31.150 --> 22:33.250
Do you dance, sing, or act?

22:34.150 --> 22:35.850
I already prepared for acting.

22:37.850 --> 22:38.950
Can you dance a bit?

22:39.650 --> 22:40.650
Eh?

22:40.750 --> 22:42.050
Can not?

22:44.750 --> 22:46.350
Five, six, seven, eight!

23:02.000 --> 23:04.350
<i>Seems like I need to seek help from Ajusshi.</i>

23:04.800 --> 23:06.200
Ajusshi...

23:07.000 --> 23:08.500
Can you accompany me to some place?

23:09.800 --> 23:11.300
Let's go together.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
<i>Perhaps...</i>

23:17.000 --> 23:18.200
Hyung~ ...

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
<i>Apparently.</i>

23:26.000 --> 23:27.800
Conversation is important , conversation.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.200
The first conversation is the moment you're holding the umbrella.

23:30.650 --> 23:32.800
For a girl,  this is really important.

23:33.700 --> 23:35.800
As long as you listen to my advice.

23:36.400 --> 23:38.500
That girl will surely be yours.

24:23.800 --> 24:25.800
Ah, why are you following me?

24:27.000 --> 24:28.200
In the middle of the rain...

24:30.100 --> 24:31.600
...there's you.

24:33.100 --> 24:34.200
What?

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
Really!

24:38.400 --> 24:39.900
What a crazy person this fella?

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
Psycopath!

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
I'm going crazy!

24:45.000 --> 24:46.900
<i>Bong Soo Mi also a runner.</i>

24:47.800 --> 24:50.800
<i>In every sports competition, she's an athlete who works really hard.</i>

24:51.000 --> 24:53.200
Ah, really!
Is the conversation too excessive?

24:54.800 --> 24:56.600
Even though I'm  a doctor, I feel so complicated.

24:57.300 --> 24:59.900
<i>Beside me, there's still a doctor.</i>

25:00.700 --> 25:02.700
During my time, it's enough to just give flowers.

25:03.300 --> 25:06.700
But now, that method is long gone.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
Aniyo.

25:08.500 --> 25:10.200
Your words seem logic.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
When do you usually give flowers?

25:13.000 --> 25:13.800
During acceptance ceremony.

25:14.000 --> 25:14.800
Also?

25:14.800 --> 25:15.600
Graduation ceremony.

25:15.600 --> 25:18.000
Right! But...

25:18.500 --> 25:20.700
The florist is opened everyday.

25:21.500 --> 25:22.700
How awesome.

25:23.800 --> 25:27.100
Who will buy the flowers? And to whom will they give?

25:30.000 --> 25:34.000
<i>No wonder they are doctors.
Their arguments are too deep.</i>

25:35.000 --> 25:35.900
Omma...

25:35.900 --> 25:38.100
Is it okay like this?

25:38.500 --> 25:41.100
Omma, for 20 years haven't done any other jobs than this.

25:41.100 --> 25:43.900
Teenage nowadays is like that. Looking at this kind of haircut, they'll loose their mind.

25:50.300 --> 25:52.100
I'm definitely not a fan of this.

26:02.500 --> 26:04.500
This is the last one.

26:09.500 --> 26:10.400
Halo?

26:10.700 --> 26:13.300
Director-nim, I'm on my way there now.

26:13.500 --> 26:15.700
I will arrive soon after I cross this red-light.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.700
It ended already, no need to come here. I'll contact you next time.

26:18.700 --> 26:21.700
Can you just hear me once?

26:22.000 --> 26:24.500
In that case, I'll do it from here only.

26:24.500 --> 26:25.320
Ne.

26:28.000 --> 26:31.300
<i>[It's so pretty]</i>

26:31.300 --> 26:34.800
<i>[The person who stole my heart]</i>

26:37.000 --> 26:40.200
<i>[It's so pretty]</i>

26:40.200 --> 26:43.600
<i>[The person who stole my heart]</i>

26:45.100 --> 26:47.500
<i>[Night time, during autumn]</i>

26:47.800 --> 26:51.800
<i>[The person who make me not able to sleep because of love]</i>

26:53.800 --> 27:00.600
<i>[The person who give me smile which is short, and cry which is long]</i>

27:03.000 --> 27:10.800
<i>[If only you'd speak to me, even once...]</i>

27:11.700 --> 27:19.500
<i>[If only you'd smile at me, even once...]</i>

27:20.500 --> 27:28.500
<i>[If only you'd accept my hands, even once...]</i>

27:28.500 --> 27:35.000
<i>[I'll fly high in the night sky...]</i>

27:35.300 --> 27:37.900
<i>Bong Soo Mi can also sing</i>

28:21.400 --> 28:23.800
It's not because of the beautiful flowers...

28:24.300 --> 28:27.000
..but because of your present, it feels like Spring.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
Really, you again?!!

28:39.800 --> 28:41.000
Is this 80-s huh?

28:41.200 --> 28:44.000
If you really wanna give, a dozen of ramyun is better.
[Ramyun is Korean instant noodle]

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
Plus, what kind of concept is that?

28:46.000 --> 28:47.500
That sunglass, can you remove?

28:47.500 --> 28:51.500
I know you're a psychopath, but this is too much!

28:55.200 --> 28:56.000
Bong Soo Mi!

28:57.200 --> 28:58.600
It's me!

28:59.600 --> 29:01.200
<i>I'm Yeo Jang Boo-ah.</i>

29:04.200 --> 29:10.700
Ahh, it's that why you're doing this? Really miracle!

29:10.900 --> 29:12.900
But my name is Oh Soo Mi.

29:20.200 --> 29:22.500
<i>Fail because of your haircut?</i>

29:23.300 --> 29:24.500
It's not, right?

29:24.500 --> 29:26.500
She likes you hair, right?

29:27.400 --> 29:31.600
You're wrong Omma. If paid, the result wouldn't be like this, right? Omma, just cut whatever.

29:31.600 --> 29:33.200
<i>It's the wrong Soo Mi.</i>

29:33.200 --> 29:36.800
<i>Not Bong Soo Mi, but Oh Soo Mi.</i>

29:38.700 --> 29:40.900
<i>Impossible she's like that</i>

29:42.300 --> 29:44.300
<i>It's not pretty at all.</i>

29:59.100 --> 30:01.500
<i>What can be done to produce a drawing this good?</i>

30:02.000 --> 30:03.200
Jang Boo-ah!

30:04.800 --> 30:06.400
You haven't gone to work?

30:06.400 --> 30:09.700
<i>Even if I don't come it's okay.
What ever needs to be done, already done.</i>

30:09.700 --> 30:10.700
What?

30:11.300 --> 30:14.700
He said that if I go there my eyes will worsen.

30:14.900 --> 30:18.100
<i>If that's the case, just go there and tell them you're quiting. Then go home.</i>

30:38.000 --> 30:43.000
45, 46, 47, 48, 49...

30:43.200 --> 30:46.000
50, 51, 52...

30:46.000 --> 30:51.200
53, 54, 55, 56, 57...

30:51.200 --> 30:55.000
58, 59, 60...

30:56.100 --> 30:59.300
So heavy!! Aww, my waist!

30:59.500 --> 31:01.300
Aigo...

31:02.300 --> 31:03.500
Excuse me!!

31:08.600 --> 31:11.600
Ani. This pretty woman, has this kind of problem...

31:11.600 --> 31:13.400
...you don't feel the need to help?

31:14.800 --> 31:17.800
I-I didn't see.
Didn't see? What you didn't see huh?

31:17.800 --> 31:20.100
Come on! Coincidently same way.

31:40.600 --> 31:41.700
Excuse me!

31:43.800 --> 31:45.700
Who is Bong Soo Mi?

31:47.100 --> 31:50.800
Even the saying goes,
many matters can be understood as we aged, but...

31:50.800 --> 31:53.400
...since then like it was destined --

31:53.400 --> 31:54.400
Excuse me!

31:55.200 --> 31:57.200
Can you just tell me who is she?

31:58.700 --> 32:00.200
I like her.

32:17.800 --> 32:19.800
Uh?

32:19.800 --> 32:21.800
You don't have any schedule today, right?

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
Ajusshi.

32:25.300 --> 32:27.700
I wanna quit this.

32:28.600 --> 32:29.600
Eh?

32:30.100 --> 32:31.100
Wae-yo?

32:49.200 --> 32:50.500
<i>It's been a long time....</i>

32:50.500 --> 32:52.100
<i>...finally the inspiration comes back.</i>

33:15.400 --> 33:17.800
This... can you reconsider?

33:18.100 --> 33:19.800
This job, already been used to will--

33:19.800 --> 33:21.800
Alright, Ajushi!

33:25.200 --> 33:26.400
<i>Till we meet again tomorrow.</i>

33:27.400 --> 33:28.400
Son of a b**ch!!

33:29.000 --> 33:33.100
Why can't he try to blend in?
Only when needed he called <i>hyung.</i>
Otherwise, he goes around calls me <i>ajusshi.</i>

33:33.100 --> 33:35.100
Thus, sounded so different.
How much different our age is?

33:35.600 --> 33:38.900
In terms of age and looks,
how can I look like  <i>ajusshi</i> ?

33:40.800 --> 33:42.400
What you mean go home farming?

33:42.400 --> 33:44.900
Your daughter passed the interview.

33:46.300 --> 33:47.500
Now?

33:47.500 --> 33:50.300
Of course, I'm having celebration party.

33:52.800 --> 33:57.300
People?
Of course, there are many.

34:00.300 --> 34:02.400
Omma wait a minute, I'll call you again, ok?

34:12.000 --> 34:16.300
You said compared with the flowers I gave, you prefer this one [box of ramyun].

34:30.300 --> 34:32.600
You wanna do something with me?

34:35.800 --> 34:36.800
Here.

34:45.699 --> 34:48.300
Thi-s... is the longest lines.

34:49.400 --> 34:51.400
Not the longest lines.

34:53.100 --> 34:55.300
But the lines that makes you feel better.

34:58.300 --> 35:00.600
In that case, I'm, since in the shower.

35:12.200 --> 35:16.900
No electricity at my own house.
So, don't know how to save.

35:17.700 --> 35:20.300
Who else switch on the lights?

35:20.300 --> 35:21.900
Ka-chak.

35:24.500 --> 35:27.500
Is there anyone out there?

35:34.400 --> 35:35.400
Daebak!!

35:37.000 --> 35:38.100
Right?

35:39.100 --> 35:42.100
I'm not looking stiff or something like that, right?

35:43.000 --> 35:44.600
You're looking so natural.

35:47.400 --> 35:48.700
What's your talent?

35:49.400 --> 35:50.400
Throw!

35:52.100 --> 35:53.400
I'm gonna throw ok?

35:56.800 --> 35:59.000
I'm really gonna throw alright?

36:19.400 --> 36:20.600
5!

36:24.200 --> 36:25.000
64!

36:31.700 --> 36:33.200
438!

36:36.000 --> 36:37.300
Daebak!

36:37.800 --> 36:40.600
I wanna keep that spoon for memento.

36:51.500 --> 36:53.000
<i>It's not Spring yet.</i>

36:53.500 --> 36:55.300
<i>But I smelt the scent of flowers </i>

36:56.200 --> 36:59.400
<i>Smelling this flower scent, make me feel stronger.</i>

36:59.800 --> 37:02.100
<i>Human are like that.</i>

37:19.700 --> 37:23.500
<i>Watching her from the CCTV Center, she often disappeared.</i>

37:38.000 --> 37:39.800
<i>I'm really curious as to where she went</i>

37:39.800 --> 37:43.300
<i>Seeing her gone,
make me feel worry</i>

37:48.600 --> 37:52.300
<i>Walking along the route where she went.</i>

38:01.400 --> 38:06.600
<i>There are still many roads that haven't
been covered by the CCTV camera.</i>

38:22.800 --> 38:25.900
<i>I never imagine, that there are this many roads exist.</i>

38:31.500 --> 38:35.700
<i>Following her, make my world grow bigger.</i>

38:42.700 --> 38:44.100
<i>Just look at the details. Cham!</i>

38:44.300 --> 38:47.100
<i>Almost like he memorized all these alleys.</i>

38:48.400 --> 38:51.400
But why he needs to count all the steps?

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
While wearing the sunglass...

38:58.200 --> 39:00.200
...touching those walls...

39:08.100 --> 39:09.600
Is he a psychopath?

39:27.100 --> 39:28.600
What's your job?

39:29.300 --> 39:31.600
CCTV control center.

39:32.200 --> 39:34.200
What kind of job is that?

39:34.200 --> 39:36.400
Watching all day long.

39:36.500 --> 39:37.900
Permanent?

39:37.900 --> 39:38.900
Ani.

39:40.900 --> 39:42.900
Contract employee right?

39:43.100 --> 39:44.900
Doesn't you feel worry to be fired later?

39:48.700 --> 39:49.900
Ani...

39:51.900 --> 39:54.400
Since our age already hit...

39:55.300 --> 39:57.300
It's fun.
Possible.

40:04.300 --> 40:06.900
If CCTV Center...

40:13.900 --> 40:16.900
Means there are person watching behind those camera, like that?

40:30.900 --> 40:32.500
Watching every single days...

40:33.400 --> 40:38.100
Even if you're watching it everyday, you still feel good. Do you know that kind of feel?

40:40.800 --> 40:43.200
Maybe the heart is happy.

40:46.200 --> 40:48.800
Even though haven't met before...

40:49.300 --> 40:54.300
but this  sofa...
You put it here cause you worry I'd hurt my feet.

40:55.500 --> 40:57.900
You are really attentive towards me.

41:04.100 --> 41:05.200
I-I..

41:06.100 --> 41:07.000
I just...

41:07.000 --> 41:08.800
So handsome, right?

41:18.000 --> 41:23.000
The day when I passed the interview,
if I got congratulatory from that kinda guy, it'd be perfect.

41:23.200 --> 41:26.500
He seems not that different from us. But he looks like the boss.

41:26.600 --> 41:28.500
He'd definitely  have a car, right?

41:30.800 --> 41:34.400
Driving a car like that, go for sightseeing...

41:36.100 --> 41:38.600
...the air would feel fresher.

41:39.400 --> 41:41.800
The air would carry the sweet scent.

41:43.700 --> 41:45.400
Do you have car?

41:48.400 --> 41:49.900
No.

41:53.500 --> 41:57.500
Ya, I'll go first? You'll follow me later.

41:57.800 --> 41:59.000
That guy...

41:59.000 --> 42:01.500
...like to steal glances at me.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
<i>If it were me, I'll stare directly at you.</i>

42:11.100 --> 42:12.800
You know that person?

42:14.500 --> 42:15.500
Who?

42:15.500 --> 42:16.700
That.

42:29.600 --> 42:31.100
Do you like Kenya [type of coffee]?

42:31.100 --> 42:32.700
Just roasted today.

42:35.900 --> 42:37.300
Kenya?

42:38.100 --> 42:39.700
Never been there.

42:41.800 --> 42:43.000
Do you have <i>Cha</i> ?
[ <i>Cha</i> is pronounced as car and tea in Korea]

42:43.300 --> 42:44.800
<i>Cha</i> ?
[ <i>Cha</i> is pronounced as car and tea in Korea]

42:45.400 --> 42:47.000
What kind?

42:50.300 --> 42:52.600
Ah, definitely.
We have various type of <i>cha</i> [tea].
[ <i>Cha</i> is pronounced as car and tea in Korea]

42:54.000 --> 42:55.200
<i>Son of a b**ch.</i>

43:15.000 --> 43:16.400
Kenya wtf?

43:17.700 --> 43:20.000
Just because you've been to Kenya, already arrogant.

43:23.200 --> 43:25.200
<i>Push... Push.</i>

43:25.800 --> 43:29.000
Just let it be. Where does he want to move it?

43:31.500 --> 43:32.600
<i>One day...</i>

43:32.600 --> 43:35.600
<i>...she'll walking this road with that son of a b**ch.</i>

43:35.800 --> 43:36.800
Hyung.

43:37.800 --> 43:39.200
Even if I got a car...

43:40.000 --> 43:42.800
...I'll definitely not going out with her.

43:46.100 --> 43:49.500
<i>Fake Bong Soo Mi, Oh Soo Mi...</i>

44:08.800 --> 44:12.000
<i>Even her five fingers, looks so pretty.</i>

44:22.200 --> 44:23.200
Hyung!

44:23.800 --> 44:25.200
Do you have car?

44:29.500 --> 44:31.800
Have a title. Doctor title.

44:34.800 --> 44:38.300
Should I own unnecessary things like that?

44:41.700 --> 44:44.000
Car? I did.

44:44.400 --> 44:45.800
But already sold it.

44:45.900 --> 44:48.100
For the sake of buying my child food.

44:48.400 --> 44:49.900
My child is only 10 years old.

44:50.500 --> 44:52.700
But his a appetite is like a cow.

44:53.700 --> 44:55.500
Feels like have two stomach.

44:56.000 --> 44:59.600
Everything goes inside.
Everything!

45:00.500 --> 45:04.500
If the car can be eaten, surely I'll not sell it.

45:06.800 --> 45:08.800
Omma!
Omo!!

45:10.200 --> 45:11.000
What?

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
What else? what?

45:13.700 --> 45:15.700
Our house, don't have <i>Cha</i> [car]?

45:19.500 --> 45:22.300
Just scoop out the <i>Cha</i> [tea] to drink.
[ <i>Cha</i> is pronounced as car and tea in Korea]

45:23.300 --> 45:24.300
Dr Seok-nim!

45:25.800 --> 45:26.900
Do you have <i>cha</i> ?

45:27.200 --> 45:28.300
No.

45:28.900 --> 45:29.700
Jang Boo-ah!

45:29.700 --> 45:31.700
You still work there?

45:33.000 --> 45:35.500
Why are you still there?

45:35.600 --> 45:40.200
Don't go there anymore. Find another
activities. Mount climbing or just sightseeing.

45:40.750 --> 45:42.150
Experience new things.

45:42.150 --> 45:45.350
Currently, I watching something that I like.

45:46.650 --> 45:48.650
<i>Jang Boo-ah!
Get check before going back!</i>

45:49.400 --> 45:50.700
Vision becomes clearer right?

45:50.850 --> 45:52.500
Feels the same.
- Same?

45:52.500 --> 45:53.500
Ne.

45:53.500 --> 45:55.300
With or without it, feels the same?
Ne.

45:55.300 --> 45:56.300
Let me try!

45:58.000 --> 45:59.600
Impossible! Wait-a-minute.

45:59.700 --> 46:01.500
Oh, I'm sorry-ah.

46:27.800 --> 46:29.400
Please? Happy?

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
Heard that you quit work at the mini-mart.

46:35.600 --> 46:37.600
If you have boyfriend like yourself.

46:40.400 --> 46:42.900
Only work as a courier, is it enough?

46:43.700 --> 46:45.700
I can arrange it myself.
Please go ahead.

46:46.000 --> 46:50.000
All of this for the sake of becoming a musical actress that won't guarantee enough money, right?

46:51.000 --> 46:52.000
Ya!

46:54.100 --> 46:57.000
You're crazy right?
Don't you know how old are you already?

46:57.000 --> 47:01.000
Ya, I know my age.
Please help yourself out of here?

47:07.400 --> 47:08.900
You evil jerk!

47:08.900 --> 47:11.500
You're... really evil.

47:12.200 --> 47:13.700
You crazy tenant!

47:14.000 --> 47:17.250
As long as I'm the one who collect your debt,
better you pay off soon!

47:17.250 --> 47:20.550
If my Hyung-nim are here,
you'll become stupid, you know!

47:24.000 --> 47:26.400
So you said you're stupid huh?

47:31.200 --> 47:34.000
You b**ch, what you're saying?!

47:34.100 --> 47:36.000
Repeat it again!

47:36.000 --> 47:37.800
You asked for beaten right??

47:38.700 --> 47:40.100
Stupid!!

47:40.100 --> 47:41.900
You, stupid b**ch!!!

47:41.900 --> 47:43.300
<i>Soo Mi-ah!!</i>

47:46.500 --> 47:47.300
<i>What you want?</i>

47:47.800 --> 47:50.000
Who're these two squids?

47:50.500 --> 47:52.000
Ya! What you want?

47:52.000 --> 47:54.500
Are you guys military soldier or what, you motherf***ker!

47:57.000 --> 47:58.000
Jang Boo-ah~

47:58.550 --> 47:59.700
Hurry up, climb!

48:01.550 --> 48:02.900
<i>Climb up! Hurry!!</i>

48:04.100 --> 48:05.300
<i>Ya, you guys are volunteer military huh?</i>

48:05.300 --> 48:08.500
Don't you say that you need to go somewhere now?

48:08.500 --> 48:09.500
Hurry!

48:09.800 --> 48:11.000
Climb up!

48:11.350 --> 48:13.300
- <i>What is this?</i>
- Come on, hurry up!

48:16.700 --> 48:17.700
Ya!!

48:17.700 --> 48:18.800
Ya, where are you going?
Come here!!

48:18.800 --> 48:20.800
Let's go.
Hold tight ne!

48:20.800 --> 48:21.800
Ya!

48:21.800 --> 48:23.800
Ya, what are you doing?

48:24.500 --> 48:26.500
You son of a b**ch. I said what are you doing?

48:27.900 --> 48:29.500
I'm waiting!

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
In a moment, my hyung will come back and fetch me.

48:33.000 --> 48:34.600
Crazy! YA!

48:40.000 --> 48:42.200
What if we walk while waiting?

48:46.100 --> 48:47.500
Whoa, really!!

48:47.650 --> 48:48.500
Ya!

48:48.800 --> 48:50.800
I suggest you better run.

49:07.250 --> 49:08.500
<i>Ne, please feel free to talk</i>

49:11.800 --> 49:13.200
Who is she?

49:16.100 --> 49:17.700
Komawo-yo!
[Thank you!]

49:20.200 --> 49:21.000
Quiet pretty.

49:21.000 --> 49:22.500
Why there's something like that here?

49:55.120 --> 49:59.370
Isn't this is the leave that'd grant our wishes if we catch it before it fell on the ground?

50:40.670 --> 50:44.170
It seems like there's no CCTV camera at all here.

50:45.700 --> 50:46.700
Really?

50:48.700 --> 50:51.200
But, where do you wanna go?

50:54.700 --> 50:58.500
Drive.
If you have a car, where would you like to go?

51:00.350 --> 51:04.350
My omma, after appa passed away, she went for farming.

51:05.000 --> 51:07.150
Even though I didn't like anything there....

51:07.250 --> 51:09.650
...but after a turn, you could see the sea

51:10.650 --> 51:12.450
This is the side that I like.

52:11.800 --> 52:14.000
<i>Still need to work part time!
When will I have time to go places?</i>

52:23.900 --> 52:26.800
<i>Currently, even she's disappearing
from CCTV Center...</i>

52:26.800 --> 52:30.000
<i>...I know which road she took.</i>

52:35.500 --> 52:38.300
<i>She mentioned that she loves sea.</i>

52:50.650 --> 52:52.650
<i>To go for a drive...</i>

52:53.250 --> 52:55.250
<i>...Among the people surround me,
there's no one own a car.</i>

53:02.800 --> 53:03.800
Out!

53:06.900 --> 53:08.900
<i>Arround me, person who owns a car...</i>

53:09.400 --> 53:10.900
...<i>is none.</i>

53:25.800 --> 53:27.400
This <i>cha</i>...
[bus]

53:28.000 --> 53:29.400
...is it yours?

53:30.450 --> 53:32.050
Do you know me?

53:33.850 --> 53:35.450
Trusted person.

53:37.000 --> 53:39.450
<i>Thanks to baseball player hyung's trust...</i>

53:39.450 --> 53:42.750
<i>...the main actors whom I saw through CCTV monitor...</i>

53:43.000 --> 53:44.450
<i>...ride the bus together with me.</i>

53:45.000 --> 53:46.850
<i>Although I'd like to greet them, but...</i>

53:47.700 --> 53:49.200
<i>....I feel like I'd be scolded.</i>

53:49.800 --> 53:52.200
<i>Everyone seems so tired.</i>

54:00.500 --> 54:01.500
Ajusshi!

54:04.600 --> 54:07.600
<i>I'm like the lead actor.
Feel very proud of myself.</i>

54:09.450 --> 54:13.000
<i>But everyone seems so busy.
Really busy.</i>

54:13.800 --> 54:15.300
<i>Exactly like what I saw.</i>

54:15.400 --> 54:17.900
<i>If only they slow down a bit, it'd be better.</i>

54:37.800 --> 54:39.000
Sea...

54:39.100 --> 54:40.100
...you like it?

54:41.400 --> 54:42.500
Nope!

54:42.800 --> 54:44.400
Just that, return the ball!

54:56.000 --> 54:59.600
How nice is the sea. If you go there, you'll definitely love it.
- Will not!!

54:59.600 --> 55:01.000
It's obvious you wanna go there.

55:01.800 --> 55:03.000
Am not!

55:03.000 --> 55:05.600
You really wanna go there.
- Surely not.

55:07.500 --> 55:09.500
<i>Tomorrow's holiday?
Any plan?</i>

55:10.800 --> 55:12.400
What plan?
Just at home.

55:16.000 --> 55:19.200
Unni, you know 1 zero, 2 zeroes in Baduk right?
[Baduk is Korean Go Game]

55:21.500 --> 55:26.700
In this game, using your stones to cover the vacant position so that your opponent can't move...

55:26.700 --> 55:28.100
...this is called 'zeroes'.

55:28.600 --> 55:30.100
Similarly with my house.

55:30.100 --> 55:31.700
No one is visiting.

55:32.000 --> 55:33.500
No one can enter.

55:33.500 --> 55:35.500
You still like to play Baduk now?

55:35.500 --> 55:37.000
Except men, I'll play anything.

55:39.800 --> 55:41.000
<i>Sim Nuna?</i>

55:44.500 --> 55:46.000
Tomorrow is holiday right?

55:46.400 --> 55:49.100
I'd like to ask something.

55:49.500 --> 55:51.300
You'd like to invite me for a date?

55:51.300 --> 55:53.500
A-a-aniyo.
It's not like that.

55:55.000 --> 55:58.000
My cousin suddenly have something urgent to do.

55:59.700 --> 56:02.200
You want me to come to your family event?

56:02.800 --> 56:04.300
That's your family matters!

56:08.000 --> 56:09.600
Lower your voice.

56:14.100 --> 56:16.300
How dare he talked to me like that!.

56:17.000 --> 56:18.500
How absurd!!

56:21.800 --> 56:22.800
Unni!

56:24.200 --> 56:25.800
I have a friend, a man.

56:26.500 --> 56:30.300
He said during elementary school, he have a girl whom he really like.

56:30.800 --> 56:33.800
In his thirties, he met the girl again.

56:34.800 --> 56:39.000
But he's not even working seriously, only works odd job and playing around everyday.

56:40.500 --> 56:41.900
In your opinion, how will he think about it?

56:41.900 --> 56:43.900
Surely, he'll feel that is really bad.

56:44.400 --> 56:45.900
Better not meeting at all.

56:45.900 --> 56:47.900
Rather than meeting then crashed her view.

56:56.500 --> 56:57.500
Soo Mi-ah!

56:58.000 --> 57:00.800
If you just start acting,
when will you able to become the lead actress?

57:08.000 --> 57:11.000
[ <i>Why won't you pick up the phone? If the money is not settled this week, you better watch out!</i> ]

57:17.000 --> 57:18.200
The matter hasn't settled yet?

57:18.800 --> 57:20.400
You wanna be dead?
Why hasn't work on it yet?

57:20.500 --> 57:22.900
<i>It's been days, the hell are you doing?</i>

57:27.200 --> 57:30.400
These boys!
Flocking like that, scared the hell of people.

57:39.300 --> 57:41.300
It's coming! It's coming! It's coming!

57:41.300 --> 57:43.300
Stop! Stop! Stop!

57:48.300 --> 57:50.500
This <i>car</i> is really huge!
Quite okay!

57:53.400 --> 57:55.200
There are still passengers who hasn't gone out yet!

58:34.400 --> 58:37.200
Ajusshi, where're you going?

58:38.000 --> 58:40.500
Ah, cham. We are going to the sea.
Sea.

58:41.000 --> 58:43.500
This <i>car</i> is a bit too large huh?

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
You said that you love sea.

58:48.200 --> 58:49.200
Sea?

58:51.400 --> 58:53.400
Ya, I still need to go to work!

58:54.600 --> 58:58.600
There, already have our employee to help out.
You don't need to worry.

58:58.600 --> 59:00.600
We should just enjoy this trip!

59:06.800 --> 59:09.000
I can't get meddle into other family business.

59:53.000 --> 59:54.000
Siljang-nim!

59:58.100 --> 01:00:00.200
Ajusshi, where are you from?

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:02.000
Jongnok-U, Pilun-dong.

01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:04.800
But where are you heading?

01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:06.000
Busan, Haeundae.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.200
We're not going to be long!

01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:10.000
Will not stay overnight, but will return.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.800
Aigoo, so long as I live, this is the only time I faced something like this.

01:00:14.100 --> 01:00:16.100
Do you know why local bus,
is called local bus?

01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:19.400
Cause it'll only works at its own district.

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:22.200
For what reason you're driving the this til here?

01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:24.700
In that case, how about Incheon?

01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:26.800
Will not overnight, directly return back.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Why you keep mentioning bout overnight or not?

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.600
Ah, that's a bus too, why can he pass?

01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:35.800
Why only me got arrested.
This is different treatment. Different.

01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:40.000
That's an express bus,
and yours is a local bus.

01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:43.000
Ah, I don't know!
I wanna pass. Let me pass!

01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:45.000
Really, this person!

01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:49.400
Quickly go back to your own zone!

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Ah, really! You don't know how hard is the part time job is? This ajusshi!

01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:36.950
<i>Never would I imagine, that I would knew lots of people.</i>

01:01:40.750 --> 01:01:44.750
<i>If only I'd keep seeing them.
How nice.</i>

01:01:57.750 --> 01:02:00.450
F***k!
Clearly said to me just now wanna go to sea.

01:02:03.350 --> 01:02:09.000
Our young master here,
Is actually having good energy or not?

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.050
The type that fall asleep too would burn energy.

01:02:12.050 --> 01:02:13.850
What kind of crap you're saying?

01:02:13.850 --> 01:02:18.450
My appa is currently asleep,
when he wakes up, thugs like you guys...

01:02:19.250 --> 01:02:21.250
...definitely not his opponent!

01:02:22.650 --> 01:02:24.450
Really, I'm not kidding!

01:02:25.350 --> 01:02:27.350
Even now, you doesn't look like you're kidding!

01:02:36.850 --> 01:02:38.850
Ah, we're supposedly should just go to sea.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:47.000
It's my first time, seeing someone who works really hard.

01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:50.600
At the sidewalk...

01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:52.600
...when you're singing...

01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:54.600
...truly amazing to witness that...

01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:56.200
...and it makes me feel envy.

01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:07.800
<i>My appa is sick.
An illness that makes him often falling asleep.</i>

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.800
<i>But if I called for him,
he'll be awake.</i>

01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:16.800
Which one is good...

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:19.800
...in this area?

01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:22.200
Don't you know it very well?

01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:26.200
Why?

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.000
<i>Baek Goo-ah...</i>

01:03:33.700 --> 01:03:37.000
If one day, you bumped into me...

01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:39.800
Will you greet me first?

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:40.800
Why?

01:03:42.700 --> 01:03:44.100
It's nothing.

01:03:47.300 --> 01:03:48.800
Why is it?

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.800
<i>The latest result regarding the search trail of the missing woman...</i>

01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:08.300
...now the police have concluded that, it's not a missing case but a kidnapping.

01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:11.380
<i>The vehicle owner is assumed as the main suspect.</i>

01:04:12.300 --> 01:04:16.300
At this moment, the suspect vehicle had been confirmed leaving Seoul.

01:04:16.300 --> 01:04:18.300
<i>But that doesn't mean we can relax.</i>

01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:22.000
<i>After things have subsided a little,
he'll probably return to Seoul.</i>

01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:24.700
<i>Plus it's not guarantee that cases like this will not be repeated.</i>

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.300
<i>If you've seen a vehicle which is similar with that vehicle...
</i> 5. 4, 3, 2, 1...

01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:30.700
<i>...the first thing that you'd do is to confirm the number plate.</i>

01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:35.200
<i>A growing number of cases happened in area in which haven't been covered by the CCTV camera.</i>
5, 4...

01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:40.000
<i>The best thing if after disappearing from the monitor screen...
</i>- 3, 2, 1.

01:05:24.300 --> 01:05:26.100
Don't you know how scary the world is!!

01:05:42.650 --> 01:05:44.500
All day long, you only look at me?

01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:45.900
No need to work?

01:05:46.700 --> 01:05:48.300
That's my job.

01:05:49.100 --> 01:05:51.100
Not just pay attention to you only.

01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:53.100
Jang Boo-ah~

01:05:57.400 --> 01:06:01.000
You...like me?

01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:05.200
Even though I'm not Bong Soo Mi
who's pretty and cute...

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.800
...as in your memories.

01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:13.300
You...still like me?

01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:16.800
Yes.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:28.000
For us to date, I should be able to look into your eyes.

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:47.400
Looking into eyes, I can read your feelings.

01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:52.400
It turns out, you truly like me, ne?

01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:04.300
They said winter this year will be very cold.

01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:08.200
This is for the bus petrol.

01:07:12.700 --> 01:07:14.700
The sea...

01:07:16.100 --> 01:07:17.760
...thank you.

01:08:19.899 --> 01:08:21.000
<i>If only...</i>

01:08:21.700 --> 01:08:23.700
<i>...I can keep staring at you, how nice.</i>

01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:35.600
Wanna stop by for awhile?

01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:40.800
Wanna have a cup of tea first before going back?

01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:44.800
Or maybe you're busy, don't have time?

01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:47.100
Ani, not busy at all!

01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:49.800
<i>Wanna have tea?</i>

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.800
<i>Wanna have a cup of tea huh.</i>

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:58.600
Lets go inside!

01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:01.000
You go back first.

01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:03.899
Why?
Just now Soo Mi absolutely invite me for tea upstairs.

01:09:03.899 --> 01:09:05.500
You just go back!

01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:07.200
Let me have a cup of tea first.

01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:09.300
I told you to go back!
Hurry that way! Go!

01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:11.399
Why climb this far?
Waste of energy!

01:09:13.399 --> 01:09:14.800
Help me push this first!

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.700
Go! Go!

01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:49.200
Empty this house!

01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:50.600
That's right, empty this house!

01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:52.800
Get out! Get out!
Don't touch anything!

01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:54.800
You get out there!
Get out!

01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:58.600
I told you I'll pay.

01:09:58.700 --> 01:10:00.700
This women crazy huh?

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:22.800
<i>Don't touch! Stop it!</i>

01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:45.400
<i>Do you know?</i>

01:10:45.450 --> 01:10:49.250
<i>The more you lived,
the more you feel the past is better.</i>

01:10:50.350 --> 01:10:52.850
I feel that my old self is far more better.

01:10:53.850 --> 01:10:55.850
Even though I keep on living...

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:00.500
...I gain self-confidence only if my old self is far more better than my current self.

01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:05.800
This makes me very annoyed.

01:11:08.100 --> 01:11:11.600
Never cross my mind, to keep hiding it from you.

01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:15.800
I'm sorry.

01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:23.100
Just...

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:27.400
...when we're still young, in times of trouble
I runway.

01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:30.550
Thats make me feel even sorrier to you.

01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:33.450
Compared to that.

01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:38.300
You are once the person whom I liked.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:44.500
I don't wish you to know,
I'm leading this kind of life.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:53.200
After known all this,
surely you don't feel good, right?

01:11:58.200 --> 01:12:02.500
Ya, so what if
Bong Soo Mi or Oh Soo Mi?

01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:05.200
Important thing it's still the same Soo Mi.

01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:17.700
I have also been keeping well your drawings
that you've given me more than ten years.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
Already becomes like this,
don't you feel touched?

01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:28.900
<i>I really like these drawings.</i>

01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:48.600
<i>Feels like...
I can't draw anymore.</i>

01:13:19.700 --> 01:13:21.600
Only a second right?

01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:24.800
It's the same as in dramas?

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:27.000
I'll be like myself again right?

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.400
Dr Seok-nim, I'm fine right?

01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:29.400
Jang Boo-ah~

01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:33.000
Don't run or push yourself again, understood?

01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:38.000
<i>This is the final amount of the account.</i>

01:13:56.300 --> 01:13:57.800
Oh, Bong Soo Mi?

01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:00.200
I already transfered the money.

01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:03.000
You sold the house?
Finally you've come to your senses.

01:14:06.700 --> 01:14:08.600
<i>You're sure you wanna leave this place?</i>

01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:10.600
I don't have a place to stay anymore.

01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:13.200
Surely you don't wanna offer me a place unni?

01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:25.200
If one day you're famous, don't forget to greet us

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:35.600
<i>Already drunk at this hour?</i>

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:40.500
Inhyeon-dong, Ilhwa road. At CCTV #5-29 there's a drunken guy who's fighting.

01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:45.000
Just fighting, now he's peeing carelessly.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
Anyway, please help to check there.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:50.000
[[ ... ... ...]]

01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:57.500
Already slept for about 20 minutes.
Try to wake him up.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
<i>Why is that car keep circling there?</i>

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:28.000
2618.

01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:46.800
2618.

01:16:03.700 --> 01:16:04.900
Team leader-nim!

01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:10.500
Suspect vehicle of  Puya-dong kidnapping appeared.

01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:14.000
Inhyeon-dong, Ilhwa road, near CCTV #6-38.

01:16:14.500 --> 01:16:17.000
Suspect hasn't been out of the car, still can't confirm yet.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.200
"Need to confirm first whether it's the suspect or not"

01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:20.700
Suspect should be arrested on the spot.

01:16:20.700 --> 01:16:23.500
"Then once the suspect got out of the car and approach women, inform immediately"

01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:25.500
"We will standby around that area"

01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:27.300
"Inhyeon Patrol Team depart immediately!"

01:16:27.300 --> 01:16:29.500

01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:48.200
"Suspect car, Yangyeon-dong, road 1"

01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:51.200
Expected to pass Yangyeon-dong, road 1 CCTV cam #1-14.

01:16:51.300 --> 01:16:55.800
"Immediately head to area near CCTV cam 1-14 and waiting for suspect car there."
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

01:16:57.300 --> 01:16:59.300
<i>CCTV #1-14 no sign yet?</i>

01:17:00.300 --> 01:17:03.900
<i>Try to search around the nearby area!</i>
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

01:17:04.100 --> 01:17:05.300
<i>Surely he needs to pass there.</i>

01:17:05.350 --> 01:17:07.350
"Patrol car arrived at the location. Waiting for post."

01:17:07.350 --> 01:17:09.350
"Please inform the last location of the suspect car."

01:17:09.750 --> 01:17:10.950
<i>Confirming.</i>

01:17:11.550 --> 01:17:14.050
Where did it go?
<i>"Location still not confirmed yet?"</i>

01:17:15.250 --> 01:17:16.650
Team leader-nim, missing.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
Missing?
Try to search again carefully!!

01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:21.800
Where? Where did he wanna go actually?

01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:27.600
Already confirmed around Inhyeon-dong area.
But there haven't many area covered by the CCTV cam yet.

01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:31.800

Try to search again around the last location the suspect car is seen!</i>

01:17:32.350 --> 01:17:35.700
<i>It could be that he's return back to Dongsung area.
Try to find there too.</i>

01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:41.000
Where?

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
Standby at Inhyeon-dong! Standby, standby!

01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:47.300
Jang Boo-shi!

01:17:48.100 --> 01:17:49.200
Ya!

01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:41.600
"CCTV center, haven't got the actual location yet?"
Team leader-nim, is it possible...

01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:43.600
...that they're going to Ryeonpi road?

01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:44.600
Confident?

01:18:45.700 --> 01:18:47.300
<i>I'm asking you, confident or not?</i>

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:50.800
Standby, standby first.

01:18:51.700 --> 01:18:55.300
<i>The best if send units to the area where the suspect vehicle was first encountered.</i>

01:18:55.400 --> 01:18:57.400
"The rest of the units, standby at Inhyeon-dong."

01:18:57.400 --> 01:18:59.800
"Unit 5 head towards to Ilhwa road and standby there."

01:19:00.700 --> 01:19:03.500
"Unit 5 head now towards to Ilhwa road and standby at the location."

01:19:03.700 --> 01:19:08.200
"Before the actual location is confirmed, all units standby at your post."

01:19:10.100 --> 01:19:12.100
Hello? Sang Man-shi?

01:19:25.350 --> 01:19:29.550
41, 42-

01:19:31.350 --> 01:19:32.550
- 43.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
Suspect vehicle seen in Inhyeon-dong.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.200
<i>All units head toward Inhyeon-dong immediately!</i>

01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:19.600
<i>There are many alleys around that area.</i>

01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:21.600
<i>Possibly the suspect already found another victim.</i>

01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:23.800
<i>Then once arrived at the scene, immediately search through all the alleys there.</i>

01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:26.200
<i>Unit 5 near Ilhwa-dong immediately move.</i>

01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:28.400
<i>Unit 5 report immediately upon arriving at the location.</i>

01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:38.400
Dr Byung-nim too? Why are you like this?

01:20:43.500 --> 01:20:49.000
As his mentor, he sat beside me drawing map...

01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:52.600
...I thought he kicked out of boredom.

01:20:53.500 --> 01:20:55.700
I always thought he's a weird person.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.200
Jang Boo, he-...
What're you doing now?

01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:04.600
...he can't see currently.

01:22:01.300 --> 01:22:02.600
Soo Mi-ah~

01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:05.400
Soo Mi-ah~

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:42.200
Soo Mi-ah~

01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:44.900
Bong Soo Mi!

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:52.400
Bong Soo Mi!

01:23:45.800 --> 01:23:47.400
Are you okay, Jang Boo-ah?

01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:54.600
Soo Mi-ah, you're okay?

01:23:55.700 --> 01:23:58.200
You...why like that?

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:04.200
Ah, I-...I'm worried about you.

01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:09.000
I ran and ran. Without realized it, I kept running. Maybe I was too panicked.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:15.200
You're okay?
Police will arrive soon.

01:24:15.300 --> 01:24:17.600
Everything is gonna be fine.
Luckily.

01:24:18.500 --> 01:24:22.020
Should you not be running?
If you run, you'll be dizzy?

01:24:24.100 --> 01:24:27.950
You're right, but today I can.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.300
There are also times like this.

01:24:31.300 --> 01:24:35.000
Apparently, since I'm running I was able to catch your hand. Right?

01:24:35.300 --> 01:24:37.000
I'm the one who caught your hand!

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
You're almost got hurt just now.

01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:43.700
It's okay, Soo Mi-ah.
Police will arrive soon.

01:24:46.200 --> 01:24:50.200
You're okay?
Please follow me first.

01:24:57.400 --> 01:25:01.400
Situation here is over. Suspect manage to escape. We'll bring the victim back.

01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:26.800
You're okay?

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:29.400
Is she gone?

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:38.500
Ajusshi, is the woman here just now left?

01:25:42.500 --> 01:25:44.500
It's me, your hyung!

01:25:46.250 --> 01:25:47.900
You're okay?

01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:50.800
Hyung?

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:58.500
F**ck it! You were so cool just now.
To be able to run.

01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:01.500
My guts said she'll surely be touched.

01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:08.500
Hyung!

01:26:12.700 --> 01:26:14.700
I'm not okay!

01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:18.200
Please hold me.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
Please hold me.

01:27:12.900 --> 01:27:16.700
<i>The moment I heard I'll loose my sight, I calmly thought.</i>

01:27:16.700 --> 01:27:20.700
<i>I should study carefully, all the alleys that I'll pass through.</i>

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:29.000
<i>But after meeting again with you,
I can no longer feel calm.</i>

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
I already prepared myself.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:07.800
You don't have to worry.

01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:11.600
From our house to ophthalmology.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:15.000
And from our house to Omma market.

01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:19.100
To Jang Mi's school.
And from our house...

01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:23.200
For you to prepare all these, the world's calling you?

01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:29.200
I should have known the area where I live, right?

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.400
Appa too already passed away.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:37.100
Deservedly as a man, I should support this family.

01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:00.400
Omma.

01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:04.000
What else can I do?

01:29:05.350 --> 01:29:10.000
Is it true after loosing sight,
there's nothing else I can do?

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
My age too is no longer young.

01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:15.800
My son is so handsome.

01:29:16.500 --> 01:29:18.700
Even if you're blind, so what?

01:29:19.500 --> 01:29:21.600
You still can walk own your own.

01:29:25.300 --> 01:29:28.900
Ya, compared to when you're stuck in your room watching drama and not speak clearly.

01:29:29.500 --> 01:29:31.500
Currently, you're 100 times better.

01:29:41.100 --> 01:29:43.100
<i>What else can I do?</i>

01:29:45.800 --> 01:29:46.800
<i>Dr Seok-nim!</i>

01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:48.400
<i>Yes, Jang Boo-ah?</i>

01:29:49.700 --> 01:29:51.100
<i>What's that?</i>

01:29:53.800 --> 01:29:55.600
<i>Do I look like this?</i>

01:29:58.550 --> 01:30:00.400
<i>I look so fierce.</i>

01:36:24.700 --> 01:36:28.700
<i>Although I can't see, but I'll still remember you.</i>

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:34.500
<i>Your face. Your walking posture.</i>

01:36:36.300 --> 01:36:38.000
<i>Your hair</i>

01:36:38.900 --> 01:36:42.400
<i>And also, your laugh.</i>

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
<i>Even though I can not see... </i>

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:53.000
<i>...but I'm still able to paint you.</i>

01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:55.000
Where do you wanna go today?

01:38:57.800 --> 01:39:00.800
You know I'm here?

01:39:01.800 --> 01:39:07.600
I still have more than 5 million places that I wanna visit with you.

01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:13.400
How do you know?

01:39:15.100 --> 01:39:16.800
Cause there's flower scent.

01:39:19.400 --> 01:39:21.900
Not because of the flower blossom.

01:39:23.100 --> 01:39:26.600
But because of you're here, it feels like Spring.

01:40:03.500 --> 01:40:05.500
<i>Sorry, cause I'm late. </i>

01:40:05.500 --> 01:40:07.100
<i>It's okay.</i>

01:40:07.500 --> 01:40:10.300
<i>After all, my world moves very slow.</i>

01:40:17.250 --> 01:40:20.300
<i>Ah, how's the fate of the kidnapper at that time?</i>

01:41:02.650 --> 01:41:04.000
<i>Appa!</i>

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.800
<i>Ya! What do you want, you mother f**cker?</i>

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.200
<i>What you're looking? Bastard!</i>

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:25.500
<i>Why put out a knife in front of a child?</i>

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:27.700
<i>Still don't wanna put down your knife?</i>

01:41:27.700 --> 01:41:29.300
<i>Wanna get beaten?</i>

01:41:33.500 --> 01:41:34.500
<i>Capture him!</i>

01:41:40.500 --> 01:41:44.500
