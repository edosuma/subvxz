01:51.507 --> 01:52.787
Hey!

02:10.387 --> 02:11.539
Halt!

02:17.748 --> 02:19.924
What are you doing up there?

05:23.572 --> 05:25.941
Would you like to join us?

05:46.130 --> 05:47.473
The Fuhrur tells us,

05:47.475 --> 05:49.521
"Be swift as greyhounds,

05:49.523 --> 05:53.236
"as tough as leather, and
as hard as Krupp steel."

05:54.418 --> 05:56.788
You are the future of Germany.

05:57.876 --> 06:01.428
The next 1,000 year
Reich depends on you.

06:02.803 --> 06:04.945
- I promise.
- I promise.

06:04.947 --> 06:07.633
To always do my
duty in the Hitler Youth.

06:07.635 --> 06:10.769
To always do my
duty in the Hitler Youth.

06:10.771 --> 06:12.689
Out of
love and loyalty.

06:12.691 --> 06:14.993
Out of
love and loyalty.

06:14.995 --> 06:17.425
To the Fuhrer, the
flag, and the fatherland.

06:17.427 --> 06:20.818
To the Fuhrer, the
flag, and the fatherland.

06:20.820 --> 06:22.229
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

06:35.060 --> 06:36.626
Don't be afraid.

06:36.628 --> 06:37.971
Hitler is our friend.

06:39.316 --> 06:42.132
Week on week, I see
you sitting here.

06:43.219 --> 06:45.524
This is your chance
to be somebody,

06:46.610 --> 06:48.852
your chance to be part
of something amazing.

06:50.642 --> 06:52.692
The Fuhrer cares for us.

06:54.932 --> 06:56.467
Just come to one session.

06:57.748 --> 07:00.564
New boys are joining every
week as you have seen.

07:09.138 --> 07:10.577
Here.

07:10.579 --> 07:11.220
Next week.

07:13.490 --> 07:14.643
If you don't want to,

07:15.635 --> 07:16.820
just return the uniform.

07:18.515 --> 07:20.467
I am sure you would
look very smart.

08:07.379 --> 08:09.554
I'm sorry I couldn't
be with you today, Hans.

08:09.556 --> 08:11.730
Oh father, please
don't apologize.

08:11.732 --> 08:13.329
The Fuhrer's work is important,

08:13.331 --> 08:15.248
and I would hate to think you
would stop your war efforts

08:15.250 --> 08:16.530
just for my drawing.

08:16.532 --> 08:18.769
Architecture,
what an achievement.

08:18.771 --> 08:22.001
- I am very proud.
- And I am proud of you.

08:22.003 --> 08:23.092
You are an inspiration.

08:24.212 --> 08:25.361
We all have
a love for the Fuhrer,

08:25.363 --> 08:28.659
although, I don't agree with
everything he stands for.

08:29.649 --> 08:30.769
Your mother tells me of
your wonderful job offers.

08:30.771 --> 08:32.850
It's a great opportunity.

08:32.852 --> 08:34.388
Make good use of it.

08:35.602 --> 08:38.544
You are a very talented
young man, Hans.

08:38.547 --> 08:40.724
- Thank you.
- It's an easy choice.

08:41.748 --> 08:42.832
There's nothing more typical

08:42.835 --> 08:44.339
than an elder with such a view.

08:45.842 --> 08:48.915
Father, over 900,000 Hitler
Youth attended the rally.

08:50.131 --> 08:53.265
Hitler Youth are not supposed
to cry, but the emotion,

08:53.267 --> 08:54.513
the dedication for our leader,

08:54.515 --> 08:56.338
some could not
control themselves.

08:56.340 --> 08:58.257
We are very lucky to
have such a great leader

08:58.259 --> 09:01.650
and we must do all we can to
succeed the 1,000 year Reich.

09:01.652 --> 09:04.017
I will give my
life to the Fuhrer.

09:04.019 --> 09:06.961
I understand the
importance here,

09:06.963 --> 09:09.524
but there is a time and a
place and this is neither.

09:10.930 --> 09:13.427
You are here to celebrate
your achievements, Hans.

09:14.706 --> 09:17.810
As we thank the Fuhrer
for all his kindness,

09:17.812 --> 09:19.568
we need to remember

09:19.570 --> 09:22.099
what we need to
celebrate as a family.

09:24.692 --> 09:26.996
I am very proud of you Hans.

09:27.891 --> 09:28.724
Well done.

09:29.747 --> 09:30.706
And I will say this,

09:30.708 --> 09:32.657
without the help
from the Fuhrer,

09:32.659 --> 09:33.873
we would not have been able

09:33.875 --> 09:35.636
to afford such an
amazing education.

09:36.916 --> 09:41.556
So, we wish you all the very
best for the future, Hans.

09:43.506 --> 09:45.361
To Hans,
the architect.

09:45.363 --> 09:46.196
The architect.

09:48.018 --> 09:48.659
Heil Hitler.

09:56.755 --> 09:59.249
Do you remember your
mother's chicken soup?

09:59.251 --> 10:00.468
I am trying to now.

10:02.962 --> 10:05.777
One day, we'll be
evacuated from here,

10:05.779 --> 10:06.867
to a better place,

10:08.148 --> 10:11.153
with plenty of food
and a warm fire.

10:11.155 --> 10:11.988
I hope so.

10:15.186 --> 10:16.211
Do you trust them?

10:19.026 --> 10:21.648
We can start a new
life for ourselves,

10:21.650 --> 10:22.547
have a family.

10:24.978 --> 10:25.812
Trust?

10:27.091 --> 10:28.849
I'm not sure I trust the Nazis

10:28.851 --> 10:30.803
after the way they
have treated us.

10:32.275 --> 10:34.356
But, we can only hope.

10:36.626 --> 10:38.577
We may be here forever.

10:38.579 --> 10:40.340
Why wait to start our family?

10:41.363 --> 10:43.380
Everything in
good time, my love.

10:44.754 --> 10:46.609
To start a family now

10:46.611 --> 10:48.532
doesn't seem like the
right thing to do.

10:49.586 --> 10:51.412
Would you like to
have been raised here?

10:52.371 --> 10:53.267
I know I wouldn't.

10:56.466 --> 10:58.707
We are not victims, Helena.

10:59.988 --> 11:01.617
Everything we own has
been taken from us,

11:01.619 --> 11:04.786
but they cannot
remove our souls.

11:04.788 --> 11:07.728
They cannot take away my
right to listen to Verdi

11:07.730 --> 11:10.738
or to feel the summer
sun on my face.

11:11.956 --> 11:14.513
When we wake in the
dark and hear the shouts

11:14.515 --> 11:17.521
and laughter of the guards
and the barking of the dogs,

11:17.523 --> 11:18.611
I know you are scared.

11:19.731 --> 11:21.744
I feel your heartbeat.

11:21.746 --> 11:23.218
I see your tears.

11:25.970 --> 11:28.369
Helena, one morning
they will come for us,

11:28.371 --> 11:31.153
and we will gather at the
cemetery with the others

11:31.155 --> 11:34.484
and be taken to that
place beyond these walls,

11:35.795 --> 11:42.739
but, I will hold you, Helena,
and I will protect you.

11:43.602 --> 11:47.539
And with my last
breath, I will love you.

11:49.458 --> 11:50.868
Now, eat.

12:00.659 --> 12:03.860
Now, you can
build us a new home,

12:04.755 --> 12:06.419
with a bigger garden

12:07.826 --> 12:09.491
and a playhouse for Greta.

12:13.138 --> 12:14.484
I will start right away.

12:27.666 --> 12:28.627
Heil Hitler.

15:18.546 --> 15:20.592
Get out!

16:37.330 --> 16:41.104
You will be reunited
with your things very soon.

16:41.106 --> 16:42.962
We will take you to
accommodation now,

16:43.859 --> 16:46.004
where you will rest and eat.

16:55.378 --> 16:58.514
Men and women to
separate accommodation.

17:01.939 --> 17:02.579
Move.

17:14.067 --> 17:16.880
Follow the orders we give you

17:16.882 --> 17:19.316
and you will be treated well.

17:23.603 --> 17:25.203
Follow the bellboy.

17:26.161 --> 17:28.371
He will make you comfortable.

17:33.043 --> 17:33.876
Move!

17:42.803 --> 17:44.723
Snell, move!

17:49.906 --> 17:51.379
Now, move.

18:24.082 --> 18:26.834
Move!

22:13.586 --> 22:16.467
So, this is the architect
you told me so much about.

22:19.729 --> 22:20.818
He looks like an idiot.

22:21.715 --> 22:23.216
Are you sure he can help us?

22:23.218 --> 22:25.552
Oh, he is wasted in the tower.

22:25.554 --> 22:26.896
This is Hans, very talented.

22:26.898 --> 22:28.339
Show him, show your drawing.

22:50.706 --> 22:53.300
This is very good,
very impressive.

22:54.867 --> 22:57.363
You're right Franz, he is
wasted in the crow's nest.

22:58.611 --> 22:59.475
Although,

23:00.371 --> 23:02.579
it's a little elaborate
for these leeches.

23:03.889 --> 23:06.739
But better too much
than not enough, right?

23:10.961 --> 23:11.795
Drink.

23:29.361 --> 23:31.280
You refuse a drink from me?

23:31.282 --> 23:35.759
- No, sir, I um, um, you...
- Eh, eh, eh.

23:35.761 --> 23:37.168
Relax.

23:37.170 --> 23:39.344
I won't hurt you.

23:39.346 --> 23:41.266
Not unless you're a Jew.

23:43.346 --> 23:45.395
You're not a Jew, are you?

23:49.587 --> 23:50.419
No, sir.

23:54.865 --> 23:57.650
Do you enjoy your
post in the tower?

24:00.147 --> 24:00.978
Enjoy?

24:02.578 --> 24:04.497
I enjoy the prospects
of the Fatherland

24:04.499 --> 24:05.904
and the vision of the Fuhrer.

24:05.906 --> 24:09.106
But, I feel yes,
maybe I could do more.

24:11.601 --> 24:14.866
I was thinking of applying
for a transfer, to the front.

24:16.498 --> 24:19.665
No, no, I have a job for you,

24:19.667 --> 24:21.843
very important,
direct from the top,

24:23.091 --> 24:24.627
to improve sanitation.

24:27.922 --> 24:29.331
- Prost.
- Prost.

24:42.706 --> 24:43.347
Look at them.

24:45.618 --> 24:46.578
All the same.

24:49.170 --> 24:53.330
Same eyes, noses, shape of head.

24:54.866 --> 24:56.435
Parasites on the Fatherland.

24:58.577 --> 25:00.051
That's what sets us apart.

25:24.626 --> 25:27.378
I'll never get
used to that smell.

25:30.386 --> 25:32.179
What would you like
me to design here?

25:34.002 --> 25:36.847
Well as you can hear,
there are new arrivals

25:36.849 --> 25:37.810
day and night.

25:38.738 --> 25:41.840
We need a facility
where we can process

25:41.842 --> 25:43.571
efficiently on a larger scale.

25:44.818 --> 25:47.443
But, don't build me a cathedral,

25:48.401 --> 25:49.267
just a simple

25:51.442 --> 25:52.946
factory of destruction.

25:55.922 --> 25:57.714
Do you think you're
up to that task?

25:59.251 --> 26:00.083
Yes, sir.

26:01.809 --> 26:04.815
We will give you
everything you need,

26:04.817 --> 26:08.207
but, word of advice.

26:08.209 --> 26:10.066
Choose the fattened workers.

26:11.666 --> 26:12.626
The thin ones,

26:15.505 --> 26:18.706
they're only good for making
tea and target practice.

26:21.874 --> 26:24.079
You've been given a
position of trust,

26:24.081 --> 26:25.554
and your superior officer

26:26.898 --> 26:28.690
speaks very highly
of your abilities.

26:32.657 --> 26:34.354
Do not disappoint me.

26:37.329 --> 26:39.827
I have a list of tradesmen
who can assist you.

26:40.850 --> 26:41.682
Come.

27:02.929 --> 27:05.683
Which one of you
parasites stole this?

27:18.801 --> 27:20.594
- You look guilty.
- Sir.

27:24.113 --> 27:26.352
- What are you doing?
- It's mine, sir.

27:26.354 --> 27:27.250
I must have dropped it.

27:28.850 --> 27:31.027
My mother made it for
me, something from home.

27:44.338 --> 27:45.743
What are you even doing here?

27:58.737 --> 28:00.591
Mistakes happen.

28:00.593 --> 28:02.448
The selection process
is very difficult.

28:02.450 --> 28:03.890
There are so many of you.

28:05.553 --> 28:09.234
I apologize on behalf
of my colleagues.

28:12.561 --> 28:13.458
If you are hungry,

28:16.241 --> 28:17.074
eat.

28:18.417 --> 28:20.563
And if they are
here in the morning,

28:21.841 --> 28:25.810
this pig sty will smell
worse than it already does.

28:29.971 --> 28:30.802
Wipe it.

29:26.481 --> 29:28.976
Thank you gentlemen.

29:28.978 --> 29:31.730
- There are no losers here.
- Oh, really?

29:32.881 --> 29:34.835
I won this yesterday
and Hans the day before.

29:39.794 --> 29:41.779
The losers are the pig Jews.

29:43.249 --> 29:46.322
Tomorrow, we play
with their diamonds.

29:52.787 --> 29:53.779
He shit them out.

29:55.217 --> 29:57.263
He picked them out his shit.

29:57.265 --> 29:59.122
I took them before
he swallowed again.

30:01.106 --> 30:02.831
How can you eat your own shit?

30:02.833 --> 30:04.466
I hope you washed your hands.

30:07.313 --> 30:08.274
Heil Hitler.

30:09.554 --> 30:10.642
Heil Hitler!

30:17.042 --> 30:17.937
Hans?

30:20.690 --> 30:21.907
I see you have a new friend.

30:23.537 --> 30:24.145
Klaus?

30:27.537 --> 30:30.354
He can be a very angry man.

30:32.402 --> 30:34.323
But you will have a
great time with him.

30:35.538 --> 30:37.327
He's on a diet these days.

30:37.329 --> 30:38.578
He's down to 20 a day.

30:40.114 --> 30:40.946
20?

30:41.874 --> 30:43.666
- 20 what?
- Jews.

30:44.946 --> 30:46.993
He used to kill many more
when he first arrived.

30:47.825 --> 30:48.786
He must be bored.

30:49.873 --> 30:52.690
Not now, he has you
building his new gas chamber.

30:53.970 --> 30:55.475
He can come off his diet.

30:58.385 --> 31:00.018
I hear hundreds a day.

31:01.138 --> 31:02.163
It's very impressive.

31:03.570 --> 31:05.171
By the way they are arriving,

31:06.258 --> 31:07.923
I do not think it
will be big enough.

31:33.746 --> 31:34.546
The light?

31:43.890 --> 31:46.706
This is very
good, I'm impressed.

31:49.137 --> 31:49.939
Thank you sir.

31:51.026 --> 31:53.167
Will you need my
services further?

31:53.169 --> 31:54.001
Of course.

31:55.025 --> 31:56.752
I want you to oversee the build,

31:56.754 --> 31:58.607
make sure it's how it should be.

31:58.609 --> 32:00.719
- You will need a work force.
- I see.

32:00.721 --> 32:03.599
You can choose from
many at your disposal.

32:03.601 --> 32:06.290
You will need their numbers
and their occupations,

32:07.313 --> 32:08.210
they are deceitful.

32:09.682 --> 32:11.666
If a farmer tells you
he's an electrician,

32:13.201 --> 32:15.410
if he cannot do the job, you
must shoot him on the spot.

32:16.402 --> 32:17.779
I will choose carefully.

32:19.025 --> 32:19.729
Take your time.

32:21.009 --> 32:22.675
Whoever you choose
will be isolated

32:23.634 --> 32:24.914
and killed on completion.

32:26.641 --> 32:27.794
Men and women?

32:30.898 --> 32:32.338
Why would you need a woman?

32:33.681 --> 32:35.090
Purely on occupation.

32:37.329 --> 32:38.482
If you should need one,

32:40.338 --> 32:42.191
she should not be
alone with the men.

32:42.193 --> 32:43.698
They breed like rabbits.

33:13.426 --> 33:14.067
Helena.

34:07.762 --> 34:11.408
And so, although I am SS,

34:11.409 --> 34:14.576
I will treat you with
respect, the best I can.

34:14.578 --> 34:17.103
I am of course under the
command of my superiors

34:17.106 --> 34:18.958
and need to produce
a product for them

34:18.960 --> 34:20.947
regardless of opinion from you

34:21.969 --> 34:22.802
or I.

34:26.065 --> 34:29.295
A sanitization room to clean
and refresh the inmates

34:29.297 --> 34:30.867
of the lice and diseases.

34:31.826 --> 34:32.658
Yes Helena.

34:33.681 --> 34:35.728
I am a seamstress.

34:35.730 --> 34:37.523
What use is a seamstress here?

34:38.929 --> 34:40.976
I cannot understand
why you have chosen me.

34:42.897 --> 34:44.338
Do you want me to sew something?

34:46.993 --> 34:48.594
Everyone here has a use.

34:49.841 --> 34:51.918
Some here are
qualified plumbers,

34:51.920 --> 34:53.456
builders, electricians,

34:54.417 --> 34:56.081
and others are here to assist.

34:56.850 --> 34:58.222
You are here to assist,

34:58.224 --> 34:59.600
and you can help out
with the materials

34:59.602 --> 35:02.447
that need to be on
site, paperwork,

35:02.449 --> 35:04.144
whilst I concentrate
on the construction

35:04.146 --> 35:07.283
with Rueben here, who
is a building engineer.

35:09.778 --> 35:11.921
Was a building engineer.

35:23.025 --> 35:24.111
It is very hard to work

35:24.113 --> 35:25.967
when we are being pushed around.

35:25.969 --> 35:28.785
- The best you can, you said?
- What is the problem?

35:48.178 --> 35:50.482
Animals, water, get the water.

35:52.818 --> 35:54.288
What is going on here?

35:54.290 --> 35:57.135
Laziness will not be tolerated.

35:57.137 --> 35:58.002
He is hurt.

35:59.760 --> 36:01.138
Oh, I see.

36:03.986 --> 36:05.426
Was he of importance to you?

36:06.674 --> 36:08.817
He is an engineer,
of much value yes.

36:11.026 --> 36:12.883
He is of no value now.

36:14.993 --> 36:17.233
You, outside.

36:32.530 --> 36:35.186
I hope you are not getting
to close to your workforce.

36:38.098 --> 36:41.743
Have you forgotten
what we are here for?

36:41.745 --> 36:44.816
We are trying to rid
this world of the bad,

36:44.818 --> 36:46.130
the weak and the crippled.

36:49.936 --> 36:51.026
If you commit treason,

36:52.593 --> 36:55.727
I will personally
kick away the stool.

36:55.729 --> 36:57.234
Do you understand?

36:58.641 --> 36:59.473
Sir.

37:02.354 --> 37:05.170
Your choice of
workforce, it concerns me.

37:08.113 --> 37:09.202
You, you, come here.

37:16.369 --> 37:17.203
Shoot her.

37:19.856 --> 37:22.129
Shoot her or I will hang you.

37:28.114 --> 37:28.946
Shoot her.

37:52.145 --> 37:52.978
Good.

37:54.256 --> 37:58.162
See, now, just go and get
yourself a strong one,

38:00.016 --> 38:00.850
a new one.

38:06.288 --> 38:08.530
I think the sun's coming out.

39:03.825 --> 39:06.001
Hans, what are
you doing out here?

39:06.961 --> 39:08.815
We have diamonds to win.

39:08.817 --> 39:10.224
No teeth tonight.

39:10.226 --> 39:11.758
I'll be in in a moment.

39:11.760 --> 39:13.106
I'm just getting some air.

39:14.578 --> 39:15.379
Air?

39:16.560 --> 39:18.611
The air is full
of Jew my friend.

39:24.177 --> 39:25.138
Come inside.

40:11.088 --> 40:13.137
What are you looking for?

40:14.546 --> 40:15.378
Nothing.

40:18.769 --> 40:20.946
Do you ever get the
feeling of dread?

40:21.873 --> 40:23.248
Dread?

40:23.250 --> 40:26.577
Well, I'm not sure that
it's dread that I feel but

40:28.497 --> 40:31.185
maybe more that I worry about
the way that I feel now,

40:32.849 --> 40:34.225
happy with my life.

40:36.369 --> 40:37.843
I worry that it will change,

40:39.185 --> 40:40.274
that it will end.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.337
Oh, my dear boy.

40:45.712 --> 40:47.823
Ever since you were small,

40:47.825 --> 40:52.626
you have always looked for
the light in the darkness,

40:53.554 --> 40:56.784
always bringing home stray dogs,

40:56.786 --> 40:58.706
birds if they'd fallen
from their nest.

41:00.625 --> 41:05.426
Some people will
live happy forever,

41:06.706 --> 41:09.042
but some people will
always search for more.

41:10.672 --> 41:13.553
Of course, there will
be problems on the way,

41:14.640 --> 41:18.546
but we're in safe hands.

41:20.209 --> 41:23.922
Your future is going to be
all that you have wished for

41:25.009 --> 41:25.843
and more.

42:15.826 --> 42:17.487
This is very good.

42:17.489 --> 42:18.865
You are very talented.

42:19.792 --> 42:20.753
Thank you.

42:22.096 --> 42:22.993
Is it a bank?

42:25.456 --> 42:26.831
No.

42:26.833 --> 42:27.665
What then?

42:29.010 --> 42:31.442
Somewhere all Nazis
will live one day,

42:34.192 --> 42:35.313
somewhere to reflect,

42:37.137 --> 42:38.575
retirement.

42:38.577 --> 42:41.681
Reflect, on all
of this you mean?

42:42.705 --> 42:43.346
Yes,

42:45.200 --> 42:47.697
somewhere to make sense
of why this has happened,

42:49.809 --> 42:52.562
of why you are here and not
out there raising a family.

42:55.568 --> 42:57.169
I wanted to fight
for my country,

42:58.449 --> 43:00.498
serve the Fuhrer in
battle against the enemy.

43:02.416 --> 43:03.377
But my father,

43:05.329 --> 43:07.089
to protect me from death,

43:08.688 --> 43:10.033
convinced me to come here,

43:12.785 --> 43:13.841
here, to this

43:17.521 --> 43:18.354
horror.

43:20.721 --> 43:23.151
I never thought I would question

43:23.153 --> 43:24.623
why I wear this uniform,

43:24.625 --> 43:25.521
but I do.

43:28.849 --> 43:30.706
Do you not question
why you are here?

43:31.729 --> 43:33.199
Why I am here?

43:33.201 --> 43:34.674
I am here 'cause I am a Jew!

43:36.017 --> 43:37.682
Because the Jews
ruled the world.

43:38.960 --> 43:41.519
We stole life from the Germans,

43:41.521 --> 43:42.866
their money, jewels.

43:44.337 --> 43:45.362
It must be true, no?

43:46.448 --> 43:48.113
If not, how can any
of this be legal?

43:49.105 --> 43:53.170
To kill every Jew, men, woman,

43:54.705 --> 43:55.377
and children,

43:56.304 --> 43:58.930
innocent apart from
the crime of religion,

43:59.954 --> 44:01.615
of being different.

44:01.617 --> 44:03.762
For me to think otherwise
would be one thing,

44:04.976 --> 44:06.511
but for me to act in a way

44:06.513 --> 44:08.335
to prevent what my country
believes is the solution

44:08.337 --> 44:09.234
would be treason,

44:10.769 --> 44:12.177
punishable by death.

44:16.337 --> 44:19.698
Please, don't misunderstand me.

44:21.201 --> 44:25.362
I care for you, I care for
your future, for my future.

44:26.512 --> 44:28.466
I'm not sure I can do
that any other way.

44:30.545 --> 44:31.761
This isn't easy for me.

44:33.137 --> 44:35.282
Not easy, for you?

44:37.136 --> 44:38.353
I have lost everything.

44:39.953 --> 44:42.095
I do not know whether
my husband, Samuel,

44:42.097 --> 44:44.687
is alive or dead.

44:44.689 --> 44:46.129
I go to sleep heartbroken.

44:47.120 --> 44:49.489
I wake up feeling the same way.

44:50.544 --> 44:51.858
You see this?

44:53.010 --> 44:54.639
I eat out of it.

44:54.641 --> 44:57.426
I wash in it, I
use it as a toilet.

44:59.601 --> 45:00.498
So, I am sorry,

45:01.969 --> 45:03.954
but I don't see how
this is hard for you.

45:05.745 --> 45:07.345
Your father was
right in what he did.

45:08.626 --> 45:09.906
He chose to protect you,

45:10.993 --> 45:12.079
but at some stage

45:12.081 --> 45:15.470
you have to take responsibility
for your own actions.

45:15.472 --> 45:16.305
How so?

45:16.977 --> 45:18.641
You are fed, watered.

45:20.304 --> 45:22.318
No one is pointing a gun at you,

45:22.320 --> 45:24.049
threatening your
life, your sanity.

45:25.137 --> 45:27.503
The risk of death for
you is non-existent.

45:27.505 --> 45:29.807
- Do you know what this is?
- No.

45:29.809 --> 45:30.642
Cyanide.

45:31.665 --> 45:32.943
I almost took it last night,

45:32.945 --> 45:35.122
so you see death is closer
for me than you think.

45:36.592 --> 45:38.510
I would much prefer a
gun to be pointed at me

45:38.512 --> 45:40.369
rather than feel what
I feel right now.

45:41.712 --> 45:43.823
You have all of
our possessions.

45:43.825 --> 45:47.345
You have the power over
our lives, you have it all.

45:48.625 --> 45:52.338
We have nothing and we
would not use this to die.

45:54.960 --> 45:56.367
You do not have the right.

45:56.369 --> 45:57.711
None of you have the right

45:57.713 --> 45:59.058
to decide whether
you live or die.

46:01.808 --> 46:07.121
We must keep fighting to
survive, and so must you.

46:07.889 --> 46:10.386
Why would you say that
to a member of the SS?

46:11.473 --> 46:12.882
Surely you want
all of us to die,

46:13.616 --> 46:15.249
to suffer a painful death.

46:18.385 --> 46:20.625
That is the difference
between me and you.

46:21.712 --> 46:23.247
If I wanted you to suffer,

46:23.249 --> 46:25.551
to feel pain beyond
the physical,

46:25.553 --> 46:27.662
then I would be just like you,

46:27.664 --> 46:29.522
just like the SS themselves.

46:30.928 --> 46:34.706
It would not feed my heart
to wish hurt to strangers.

46:37.265 --> 46:40.527
I just want the right
to live my life,

46:40.529 --> 46:42.897
to see the green fields again,

46:44.081 --> 46:45.584
to breathe air

46:45.586 --> 46:48.722
that is not full of a
thousand screaming souls.

46:50.544 --> 46:51.986
You need to survive this

46:53.265 --> 46:55.343
to remember for the
rest of your life,

46:55.345 --> 46:56.689
the choices that you made.

47:00.241 --> 47:01.390
No!

47:01.392 --> 47:03.056
I'm sorry, I didn't mean.

47:08.177 --> 47:09.073
I'm sorry too.

47:11.537 --> 47:12.722
I'm not like the others.

47:13.841 --> 47:16.817
I'm just an architect who
wants to design buildings, not,

47:19.505 --> 47:21.359
not sanitation rooms.

47:21.361 --> 47:23.023
Sanitation rooms?

47:23.025 --> 47:25.262
You want me to believe
what you are saying?

47:25.264 --> 47:26.993
Then you must
believe it yourself.

47:28.081 --> 47:31.918
Gas chambers, torture
rooms, target practice,

47:31.920 --> 47:33.906
we both know what we
are building here.

47:37.040 --> 47:39.761
Is Germany short on soldiers
that you have to be here?

47:41.328 --> 47:42.801
I have a choice, yes,

47:43.729 --> 47:45.489
but I want to serve my country.

47:46.608 --> 47:48.142
I know nothing else.

47:48.144 --> 47:50.321
From a young age, this
is all I have known.

47:52.977 --> 47:54.705
I don't know what
is right anymore.

47:56.912 --> 47:59.057
I will step into
sanitation one day.

48:00.080 --> 48:01.361
Is that right?

48:05.297 --> 48:07.246
You act as if you care
what happens to me.

48:07.248 --> 48:08.337
I do.

48:10.480 --> 48:12.113
How many Jews have you killed?

48:13.265 --> 48:15.408
Honestly, how many?

48:21.008 --> 48:21.873
I have killed.

48:23.057 --> 48:25.009
I am a soldier, I follow orders.

48:25.968 --> 48:27.758
If I do not, I will be killed.

48:27.760 --> 48:28.945
I have to follow orders.

48:30.928 --> 48:32.658
But never think
that I do not care.

48:35.344 --> 48:37.198
- Prove it to me.
- Prove what?

48:37.200 --> 48:38.802
Prove that you care.

48:39.857 --> 48:41.935
Save one, if not from the SS,

48:41.937 --> 48:43.918
then from the
pain, come with me.

48:43.920 --> 48:46.798
Helena wait, don't
do anything stupid.

48:46.800 --> 48:49.041
You will get yourself killed.

48:55.568 --> 48:57.265
One, just save one.

48:58.385 --> 49:00.177
Look at this man,
he is beyond saving.

49:01.104 --> 49:02.990
He might as well
be dead already.

49:02.992 --> 49:05.777
Would you rather be dead,
or left to die like this?

49:07.216 --> 49:09.007
This is a human being.

49:09.009 --> 49:11.441
Just like you and
your Fatherland.

49:12.849 --> 49:15.630
Do you see your people
suffer like this in this way?

49:15.632 --> 49:17.777
We do, we see it every day.

49:18.801 --> 49:20.210
We are forced to help,

49:22.065 --> 49:24.562
- everyday.
- None of this is my choice.

49:27.441 --> 49:29.201
Now, I suggest you
get back to work.

49:50.545 --> 49:51.890
Look at this.

49:55.696 --> 49:58.286
You know, one of them walked
up to me the other day

49:58.288 --> 50:00.785
and said, "Why us?

50:01.872 --> 50:03.854
"Why are your people
doing this to us?

50:03.856 --> 50:06.671
"We are starving, tortured."

50:06.673 --> 50:08.530
So, what did you say to him?

50:10.768 --> 50:13.073
Nothing, I shot
him in the head.

50:17.777 --> 50:19.217
How many gold teeth do you have?

50:21.712 --> 50:22.544
None.

50:23.889 --> 50:24.721
Neither do I.

50:27.599 --> 50:29.391
They stole from Germans

50:29.393 --> 50:30.767
and Germans are just taking back

50:30.769 --> 50:32.653
what is rightfully theirs.

50:32.655 --> 50:35.153
Simple subtraction, extraction,

50:37.136 --> 50:38.865
all in the nature of selection.

50:42.256 --> 50:43.026
Careful.

50:44.817 --> 50:45.585
They might bite.

50:53.840 --> 50:55.762
The man, where is he?

50:57.233 --> 50:58.706
- The hanging Jew?
- Yes.

51:00.624 --> 51:02.225
I saved him from the torture,

51:03.569 --> 51:05.201
but I could not save his life.

51:06.288 --> 51:09.647
Saved is not quite
the term I would use,

51:09.649 --> 51:11.218
but he is free from
this place now.

51:12.785 --> 51:13.616
Thank you.

51:15.024 --> 51:16.495
I wish I could
actually save someone

51:16.497 --> 51:17.906
and for them to still be alive.

51:19.376 --> 51:21.360
But it's just not
possible, you know this.

51:23.279 --> 51:24.559
In the gas chambers
and crematoriums,

51:24.561 --> 51:26.991
there are over 100 Jews.

51:26.993 --> 51:28.207
The sonderkommando who assist

51:28.209 --> 51:32.242
only four German SS officers
to carry out the executions.

51:33.713 --> 51:34.798
I would be outnumbered

51:34.800 --> 51:36.465
by the people I was
trying to save.

51:37.583 --> 51:38.958
You make it sound like
the sonderkommando Jews

51:38.960 --> 51:40.560
want to help the SS.

51:41.680 --> 51:44.526
They are forced to
kill their people,

51:44.528 --> 51:46.512
forced to drag, burn, and bury.

51:48.400 --> 51:50.862
Sometimes they have to carry
out these terrible acts

51:50.864 --> 51:52.527
on their own family,

51:52.529 --> 51:54.386
just to survive this place,

51:55.824 --> 51:58.001
in the hope that they
will be spared or rescued.

52:00.623 --> 52:01.457
It's a mess.

52:05.519 --> 52:06.545
Maybe not save,

52:07.696 --> 52:09.550
maybe you could protect.

52:09.552 --> 52:12.113
Believe it or not I am
already trying to do that.

52:13.393 --> 52:14.862
I looked for you
on the registers

52:14.864 --> 52:16.465
to enlist for this
build workforce.

52:17.872 --> 52:18.704
Because?

52:21.136 --> 52:23.794
Because I felt something
in my soul when I saw you,

52:25.745 --> 52:27.504
something that
halted my aggression,

52:28.753 --> 52:30.733
the aggression my
country wants me to have

52:30.735 --> 52:33.104
and have been trained
for as an SS soldier.

52:35.472 --> 52:37.968
My training was supposed
to filter such emotion.

52:40.017 --> 52:43.153
Something inside told
me how wrong this is.

52:45.712 --> 52:48.174
I have argued with
my father for years

52:48.176 --> 52:49.489
and agreed with Hitler.

52:52.497 --> 52:53.391
My father is a good man,

52:53.393 --> 52:55.505
but he is still a
servant of the Fuhrer.

52:58.065 --> 53:00.174
I saw a kindness in your eyes,

53:00.176 --> 53:02.096
that I'd not seen
in an SS before.

53:05.776 --> 53:07.281
Six months ago I
was in the ghetto,

53:08.369 --> 53:10.801
removed from my happy
life as a free Jew.

53:12.081 --> 53:14.641
We were still caged in
the walls of the ghetto.

53:16.049 --> 53:19.249
We survived the evacuation,
but the poverty.

53:21.136 --> 53:23.662
My husband Samuel
provided for me,

53:23.664 --> 53:25.008
loving me every day.

53:26.575 --> 53:28.113
The conditions were appalling.

53:30.320 --> 53:32.206
Our first child-...

53:32.208 --> 53:33.966
I didn't realize
you had children.

53:33.968 --> 53:34.800
I don't.

53:35.633 --> 53:36.465
But?

53:43.312 --> 53:44.337
How can this be?

53:45.232 --> 53:46.193
Was it an SS?

53:47.120 --> 53:50.543
When I first arrived,
it was hardly visible.

53:50.545 --> 53:52.369
Even naked, it was hard to see.

53:55.088 --> 53:56.657
I've been hiding it ever since.

53:59.185 --> 54:02.638
I get thinner but my bump
becomes more enlarged.

54:02.640 --> 54:03.665
Nobody knows,

54:05.393 --> 54:07.441
and now I'm telling an SS.

54:10.257 --> 54:14.925
But I can't hide it for
much longer without help.

54:14.927 --> 54:16.209
Will you help me?

54:17.169 --> 54:19.021
Will you help us?

54:19.023 --> 54:21.006
I have a few months to
construct this building

54:21.008 --> 54:23.889
but by this time you
will have given birth.

54:26.064 --> 54:27.886
We must give this life a chance.

54:27.888 --> 54:28.977
We must at least try.

54:30.480 --> 54:32.653
The war may be over by then.

54:32.655 --> 54:34.449
- How's the progress?
- Heil Hitler!

54:35.729 --> 54:37.327
This needs to move quicker.

54:37.329 --> 54:40.237
Sir, I with respect,
I need some more men,

54:40.239 --> 54:42.318
men that haven't
been here too long.

54:42.320 --> 54:44.207
I have several ready.

54:44.209 --> 54:46.129
You want me to bring
you stronger ones.

54:47.248 --> 54:49.105
Can I see the list of inmates?

54:50.577 --> 54:53.647
I've told you, you can
take as many as you need,

54:53.649 --> 54:54.514
whoever you want,

54:57.616 --> 54:58.609
but no more women.

55:01.520 --> 55:05.361
Come here, come here!

55:07.279 --> 55:09.262
We need this one.

55:09.264 --> 55:11.568
She will keep the
men pig Jews amused.

55:12.657 --> 55:14.385
It's a tactic we
all know and love.

55:20.208 --> 55:22.449
She cannot stay here
alone with the men.

55:26.032 --> 55:26.993
They will multiply.

55:29.296 --> 55:31.602
She can stay here, but
under your supervision.

55:35.759 --> 55:37.681
No fucking, you understand?

55:41.584 --> 55:43.313
I know how they work.

55:44.559 --> 55:46.224
One after the other.

55:49.104 --> 55:49.938
Vermin.

55:52.016 --> 55:53.232
Stinking vermin.

55:55.856 --> 55:58.000
The last thing we
need is more of these rats.

56:05.583 --> 56:06.544
Very good.

56:19.376 --> 56:21.522
You did that very naturally.

56:23.536 --> 56:24.657
I think he believed you.

56:25.999 --> 56:27.857
I think I believed you.

56:30.864 --> 56:33.807
What is your
husband's full name?

57:01.936 --> 57:04.113
This must be a
proud moment for you,

57:05.072 --> 57:07.118
showers with no fresh water,

57:07.120 --> 57:09.008
and a hatch with no fresh air.

57:10.289 --> 57:13.037
- Why did you bring me here?
- We have been through this.

57:13.039 --> 57:16.432
- These are my people.
- I have a visitor for you.

57:27.119 --> 57:28.080
My Helena.

57:31.152 --> 57:32.816
How did you hide this?

57:33.968 --> 57:35.664
If they knew, they
would kill you.

57:38.959 --> 57:40.848
Hans tells me he is
looking after you.

57:43.376 --> 57:44.529
There isn't much time.

57:45.615 --> 57:47.311
There is something
you need to know.

57:47.313 --> 57:48.305
What is it?

57:49.393 --> 57:50.992
Block 14 B, it's,

57:53.199 --> 57:56.302
block 14 B, it's marked for
the gas chamber tomorrow.

57:56.304 --> 57:57.776
It's already on the register.

57:58.863 --> 58:00.142
I can try and say
we need him here,

58:00.144 --> 58:02.512
but it may be too suspicious.

58:05.008 --> 58:06.737
You cannot die, no.

58:13.936 --> 58:15.437
Block 14 B is for the men

58:15.439 --> 58:18.030
that refuse the
sonderkommando post.

58:18.032 --> 58:19.217
Why did you refuse?

58:20.369 --> 58:22.801
I cannot help them
kill my own people.

58:24.592 --> 58:25.742
He was lucky.

58:25.744 --> 58:29.007
Lucky, lucky
he's in this hell?

58:29.009 --> 58:31.184
He normally would
have been hung or shot.

58:32.271 --> 58:34.384
It was only because
many of the men refused.

58:36.177 --> 58:38.221
They killed seven of them

58:38.223 --> 58:39.311
and decided the gas chamber

58:39.313 --> 58:40.977
was the quickest
and easiest way.

58:43.727 --> 58:45.904
This cannot be, you can't.

58:49.487 --> 58:50.384
You cannot.

58:52.432 --> 58:53.841
Samuel, I love you.

58:57.519 --> 58:59.152
I will take care of them both.

59:00.655 --> 59:02.477
I need to get you
back to your block.

59:02.479 --> 59:05.360
The others will
notice you are gone.

59:06.448 --> 59:08.045
I will give you a
few minutes alone,

59:08.047 --> 59:10.481
but please don't be too long.

59:15.407 --> 59:18.864
I have loved you from
the moment I saw you.

59:20.145 --> 59:22.481
Samuel you are my
heart and soul.

59:25.392 --> 59:27.953
Until my last breath, Helena,

59:29.071 --> 59:30.832
until my last breath.

59:42.607 --> 59:43.440
Thank you.

01:00:12.432 --> 01:00:14.352
What do you imagine
they're thinking?

01:00:15.568 --> 01:00:16.368
Move!

01:00:32.175 --> 01:00:34.062
It's nearly time.

01:00:34.064 --> 01:00:36.366
When your waters
break, send for me.

01:00:36.368 --> 01:00:37.521
Everything will be fine.

01:00:38.608 --> 01:00:40.336
I will bring clean
cloth and water.

01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:43.921
How will I feed my baby?

01:00:47.663 --> 01:00:48.912
You must breastfeed.

01:00:50.799 --> 01:00:52.878
I will bring you beetroot juice.

01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:54.480
We must keep you strong.

01:00:55.823 --> 01:01:00.175
This child will be born into
this life fighting, I know.

01:01:01.649 --> 01:01:03.408
Try to get rest.

01:01:09.008 --> 01:01:11.440
And this will be fully
operational in 10 days?

01:01:14.095 --> 01:01:16.334
So as your Jews have made
such a good job of it,

01:01:16.336 --> 01:01:18.225
I think they should be
the first to try it.

01:01:20.527 --> 01:01:23.310
I think they would not
have it any other way.

01:01:23.312 --> 01:01:24.240
Stand up!

01:01:26.928 --> 01:01:29.198
What's so funny?

01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:30.765
She took a beating.

01:01:30.767 --> 01:01:32.207
Sweep, Jew.

01:01:40.815 --> 01:01:41.776
Very good.

01:01:44.144 --> 01:01:45.552
The Fuhrer will be proud of you.

01:01:52.272 --> 01:01:53.232
I'm sorry.

01:02:00.784 --> 01:02:04.433
Okay, okay.

01:02:08.783 --> 01:02:09.616
Alright.

01:02:12.624 --> 01:02:13.457
Okay.

01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:19.151
Lie down.

01:02:22.128 --> 01:02:23.503
I won't be long.

01:02:23.505 --> 01:02:26.126
Please, keep the
noise to a minimum.

01:02:26.128 --> 01:02:27.344
I will get some help.

01:02:28.305 --> 01:02:29.454
Hurry.

01:02:53.839 --> 01:02:55.825
My Samuel should be here.

01:02:58.608 --> 01:03:01.105
Keep Helena quiet.

01:03:02.447 --> 01:03:04.144
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

01:03:54.255 --> 01:03:55.920
You have
a beautiful boy.

01:03:57.648 --> 01:03:59.566
Samuel,

01:03:59.568 --> 01:04:00.782
your father would have loved you

01:04:00.784 --> 01:04:03.281
more than you could ever know.

01:04:06.927 --> 01:04:09.102
I must go now.

01:04:09.104 --> 01:04:13.840
Feed the child,
you will know when.

01:04:32.528 --> 01:04:34.641
- Can you stay?
- I must go.

01:04:36.368 --> 01:04:38.800
You must keep him as
quiet as possible.

01:05:28.816 --> 01:05:29.905
Shh, shh, shh.

01:05:31.792 --> 01:05:32.432
Shh, shh.

01:05:37.456 --> 01:05:39.534
What is this?

01:05:39.536 --> 01:05:42.223
Father, I can't kill these
people without remorse.

01:05:45.391 --> 01:05:47.215
Son, I understand.

01:05:50.608 --> 01:05:51.441
But this?

01:05:54.192 --> 01:05:56.048
A baby needs to be warm.

01:06:00.718 --> 01:06:01.552
Give.

01:06:04.751 --> 01:06:05.680
Thank you father.

01:06:06.544 --> 01:06:08.464
I never wanted this for you.

01:06:09.648 --> 01:06:11.181
Why am I here?

01:06:11.183 --> 01:06:14.605
Your talent was as an
architect, not a murderer.

01:06:14.607 --> 01:06:17.165
Nothing would change your mind.

01:06:17.167 --> 01:06:19.790
Hitler Youth was your life.

01:06:19.792 --> 01:06:21.998
I couldn't just leave
you fighting at the front

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.077
like some pawn in
a game of chess,

01:06:24.079 --> 01:06:25.584
which you were fixated.

01:06:26.928 --> 01:06:28.240
Nothing else mattered.

01:06:44.752 --> 01:06:47.693
This is not what
I wanted for you.

01:06:47.695 --> 01:06:49.677
It is my duty to serve
Hitler and the Fatherland.

01:06:49.679 --> 01:06:51.596
But you have so
much more to give.

01:06:51.598 --> 01:06:54.606
Your architecture, you're
a very talented boy.

01:06:54.608 --> 01:06:56.461
After the war I
will pursue my career.

01:06:56.463 --> 01:07:00.526
But for now, my country
needs me as an SS officer.

01:07:00.528 --> 01:07:01.902
You must see that.

01:07:01.904 --> 01:07:05.036
All I see is anger and
manipulation of people,

01:07:05.038 --> 01:07:09.198
a man who trades on
fear, ignorance, hatred.

01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:11.117
But you put yourself
in danger too.

01:07:11.119 --> 01:07:13.040
But I don't want
to put you in danger.

01:07:15.599 --> 01:07:16.432
Look,

01:07:17.329 --> 01:07:20.592
I can get you a position
where I am posted.

01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:23.665
You would still be
serving the Fatherland.

01:07:25.199 --> 01:07:27.153
It would be good to
work with you father.

01:07:28.847 --> 01:07:31.693
I will arrange it, but
I think it would be wise

01:07:31.695 --> 01:07:34.253
to keep our
relationship a secret.

01:07:34.255 --> 01:07:36.782
The fact that you are my son

01:07:36.784 --> 01:07:38.829
could cause problems
for both of us

01:07:38.831 --> 01:07:41.549
and make it difficult
for me to protect you.

01:07:41.551 --> 01:07:43.182
I don't need
protecting father.

01:07:43.184 --> 01:07:44.465
No no, I know you don't.

01:07:47.278 --> 01:07:48.400
Now take your time.

01:07:49.264 --> 01:07:51.024
The fish will tire.

01:07:52.912 --> 01:07:56.077
Sometimes in life you
have to be patient

01:07:56.079 --> 01:07:57.969
and wait for what you want.

01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:06.894
You have to wait a bit longer.

01:08:06.896 --> 01:08:09.137
I will try again father.

01:08:14.992 --> 01:08:16.814
We must move quicker.

01:08:16.816 --> 01:08:20.109
We will fire up the new
crematorium and the gas chamber.

01:08:20.112 --> 01:08:23.051
There must not be a
shred of evidence.

01:08:23.054 --> 01:08:24.910
I think Hans should
have the privilege

01:08:24.912 --> 01:08:27.341
of seeing the result
of his good work.

01:08:27.344 --> 01:08:29.710
We can gas hundreds every hour

01:08:29.712 --> 01:08:32.273
after removal of the cadavers.

01:08:33.359 --> 01:08:36.013
If we get this right, we
can clear the evidence

01:08:36.015 --> 01:08:38.157
and the camp within six weeks.

01:08:38.158 --> 01:08:39.438
The trains will be full today.

01:08:39.439 --> 01:08:42.192
We must destroy as many
as possible or all this

01:08:43.823 --> 01:08:45.167
will have been a waste of time.

01:08:47.792 --> 01:08:49.424
We do not have six weeks.

01:09:11.118 --> 01:09:13.935
- Halt!
- It's me you fucking idiot!

01:09:26.479 --> 01:09:30.189
- Heir commandant!
- Hans, where have you been?

01:09:30.191 --> 01:09:32.908
Some final checks
in the gas chamber.

01:09:32.911 --> 01:09:36.080
- Special delivery for you.
- Heir commandant?

01:09:37.456 --> 01:09:38.444
Because of your efforts,

01:09:38.446 --> 01:09:39.661
you have earned the privilege

01:09:39.662 --> 01:09:41.645
of administering the gas.

01:09:41.648 --> 01:09:44.591
We need to clean up
this camp very quickly.

01:09:49.966 --> 01:09:52.910
Something I do when I'm
walking past the Jews,

01:09:52.912 --> 01:09:54.129
just, just for fun.

01:10:14.607 --> 01:10:15.440
It's a joke.

01:10:18.254 --> 01:10:19.247
Don't drop those.

01:10:20.815 --> 01:10:22.929
We need every last granule.

01:10:48.974 --> 01:10:53.646
What is this?

01:10:53.648 --> 01:10:54.477
It's Franz.

01:10:54.479 --> 01:10:55.569
Open the door please.

01:11:03.886 --> 01:11:05.485
The Soviet army
is getting closer.

01:11:05.487 --> 01:11:08.749
Klaus has ordered more marches.

01:11:08.751 --> 01:11:09.904
What is this?

01:11:16.847 --> 01:11:17.711
Zyclon B.

01:11:20.655 --> 01:11:21.488
Gas?

01:11:24.112 --> 01:11:24.944
Yes.

01:11:26.287 --> 01:11:27.120
It's time.

01:11:29.871 --> 01:11:31.376
Hans, what is to
happen to my son?

01:11:35.119 --> 01:11:36.080
We could hide him.

01:11:37.167 --> 01:11:38.000
For how long?

01:11:39.471 --> 01:11:41.646
How long before he is
dragged out and drowned

01:11:41.648 --> 01:11:43.885
or ripped up by the dogs?

01:11:43.887 --> 01:11:45.551
We can protect you both,

01:11:46.639 --> 01:11:49.261
so that you can be
with each other.

01:11:49.263 --> 01:11:52.208
We can do that.

01:11:56.047 --> 01:11:58.863
Such innocence and
light in this darkness.

01:12:01.424 --> 01:12:04.337
Why do you have the gas, why?

01:12:05.903 --> 01:12:06.734
And why if you are his father

01:12:06.736 --> 01:12:08.301
don't you do
something to help him?

01:12:08.303 --> 01:12:10.509
I can do nothing.

01:12:10.511 --> 01:12:12.686
While the Russians are coming,

01:12:12.688 --> 01:12:14.925
Hitler's demands are
becoming more erratic.

01:12:14.927 --> 01:12:17.933
Helena, they will kill everyone,

01:12:17.935 --> 01:12:20.110
prisoners, everyone who
stands in their way.

01:12:20.112 --> 01:12:21.072
There's no way out.

01:12:23.823 --> 01:12:27.916
- Why do you have the gas?
- He can do nothing, Helena.

01:12:27.918 --> 01:12:28.752
Why?

01:12:30.478 --> 01:12:32.461
I am to be the executioner.

01:12:32.463 --> 01:12:34.192
I'm sorry.

01:12:35.183 --> 01:12:39.153
You tried to help me.

01:12:40.398 --> 01:12:42.191
I am grateful of that.

01:12:47.119 --> 01:12:49.488
I will end the
darkness with my son.

01:12:51.088 --> 01:12:52.689
He came into this life with me.

01:12:53.648 --> 01:12:55.121
He leaves this life with me.

01:12:58.127 --> 01:12:59.600
I need something from you.

01:13:02.031 --> 01:13:03.408
- What?
- Cyanide.

01:13:05.294 --> 01:13:06.863
Give me the cyanide.

01:13:13.551 --> 01:13:16.303
It is not for me, it's for you.

01:13:17.008 --> 01:13:17.905
You must live.

01:13:19.376 --> 01:13:23.600
You must remember this,
these walls, this horror,

01:13:26.222 --> 01:13:27.311
the choices you made.

01:13:29.935 --> 01:13:31.344
It was our destiny.

01:13:33.008 --> 01:13:34.735
We did what we could.

01:13:49.007 --> 01:13:50.094
Your father would have loved you

01:13:50.096 --> 01:13:52.336
more than you will ever know.

01:16:22.831 --> 01:16:26.703
- The day we were dreading.
- This horror could not go on.

01:16:28.431 --> 01:16:30.288
There is only one
thing I am sorry about.

01:16:31.822 --> 01:16:33.423
We did not finish the job.

01:16:38.063 --> 01:16:39.055
We will hang.

01:16:40.942 --> 01:16:41.775
We will.

01:16:53.935 --> 01:16:54.893
What are you doing?

01:17:09.135 --> 01:17:12.080
Sometimes you
have to be patient

01:17:13.934 --> 01:17:16.463
and wait for what you want.

01:17:24.111 --> 01:17:28.816
Eyes, nose, shape of head,

01:17:31.727 --> 01:17:33.904
parasites on the fatherland.

01:17:51.854 --> 01:17:54.892
I just want
the right to live my life,

01:17:54.894 --> 01:17:57.199
to see the green fields again.

01:18:11.087 --> 01:18:12.365
Your father would have loved you

01:18:12.367 --> 01:18:14.864
more than you could ever know.

01:18:27.982 --> 01:18:29.839
I eat out of it, I wash in it,

01:18:30.799 --> 01:18:31.824
I use it as a toilet.

01:18:34.351 --> 01:18:35.214
So I am sorry,

01:18:36.527 --> 01:18:39.277
but I don't see how
this is hard for you.

01:18:39.279 --> 01:18:41.424
I worry about
the way that I feel now,

01:18:43.118 --> 01:18:44.048
happy with my life.

01:18:46.734 --> 01:18:47.823
I worry it will change,

01:18:49.551 --> 01:18:50.799
that it will end.

01:19:05.199 --> 01:19:07.085
A sanitization room,

01:19:07.087 --> 01:19:10.030
to clean and refresh the
inmates of lice and diseases.

01:19:17.326 --> 01:19:18.860
This is very good.

01:19:18.862 --> 01:19:20.143
You are very talented.

01:19:43.759 --> 01:19:46.124
You need to survive this,

01:19:46.126 --> 01:19:48.492
to remember for the
rest of your life,

01:19:48.494 --> 01:19:49.967
the choices that you made.

01:19:55.918 --> 01:19:57.582
Sanitation rooms?

01:19:57.584 --> 01:19:59.821
You want me to believe
what you are saying?

01:19:59.823 --> 01:20:01.488
Then you must
believe it yourself.

01:20:02.575 --> 01:20:04.688
Gas chambers, torture
rooms, target practice,

01:20:06.415 --> 01:20:09.103
we both know what we
are building here.

01:20:41.231 --> 01:20:42.064
Why?

01:20:43.726 --> 01:20:46.607
I am to
be the executioner.

01:20:53.711 --> 01:20:55.631
It's for you.

01:21:00.495 --> 01:21:02.412
You must live.

01:21:02.414 --> 01:21:05.356
You must remember these walls,

01:21:09.006 --> 01:21:09.968
this horror,

01:21:11.823 --> 01:21:13.552
the choices you made.

01:21:27.182 --> 01:21:28.816
Shoot her.

01:21:30.830 --> 01:21:32.304
- Shoot her.
- I won't.

01:21:38.959 --> 01:21:40.624
Shoot her.

01:22:04.943 --> 01:22:09.101
Your talent was an
architect, not a murderer.

01:22:09.103 --> 01:22:10.480
Nothing would change your mind.

01:22:11.471 --> 01:22:13.584
Hitler Youth was your life.

01:22:26.766 --> 01:22:28.687
Is it a bank?

01:22:30.799 --> 01:22:32.624
- No.
- What then?

01:22:42.127 --> 01:22:45.167
Somewhere all
Nazi's will live one day.

01:22:55.182 --> 01:22:56.719
Somewhere to reflect.

01:23:01.071 --> 01:23:02.445
Retirement.

01:23:02.447 --> 01:23:06.380
Reflect, on
all of this you mean?

01:23:06.382 --> 01:23:07.600
Yes,

01:23:13.039 --> 01:23:16.941
somewhere to make sense
of why this has happened.

01:23:26.034 --> 01:23:31.034
