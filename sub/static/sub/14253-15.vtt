02:16.736 --> 02:18.670
Tsunkat! Tsunkat!

02:18.738 --> 02:22.674
Tsunkat! Tsunkat! Tsunkat!
Tsunkat! Tsunkat!

02:22.775 --> 02:27.508
Tsunkat! Tsunkat! Tsunkat!
Tsunkat! Tsunkat! Tsunkat!

04:16.122 --> 04:19.819
Captain's Log,
Stardate 53447.2.

04:19.892 --> 04:22.292
The crew's enjoying
a much needed shore leave

04:22.362 --> 04:24.227
on the Norcadian homeworld.

04:24.297 --> 04:27.266
While l visit Pendari, a planet
in the neighboring system,

04:27.333 --> 04:30.063
l'm leaving Commander Chakotay
in charge of Voyager.

04:30.169 --> 04:32.501
You may want to run a diagnostic
on the shield generators.

04:32.572 --> 04:33.596
lt's way overdue.

04:33.706 --> 04:34.673
Consider it done.

04:34.741 --> 04:35.833
And don't forget to keep tabs

04:35.942 --> 04:37.773
on Neelix's little project
in the Mess Hall.

04:37.844 --> 04:39.175
He's still trying to enhance

04:39.245 --> 04:40.803
the plasma burners
in his stove?

04:40.880 --> 04:42.939
With some of Seven's
Borg technology.

04:43.082 --> 04:45.107
l don't want him accidentally
turning the galley

04:45.184 --> 04:46.811
into an assimilation chamber.

04:46.886 --> 04:48.046
l'll assign
a security detail

04:48.121 --> 04:49.645
to keep tabs on him--
unless you think

04:49.722 --> 04:51.314
we need to take more
drastic measures.

04:51.391 --> 04:54.383
And most important,
be sure to tell your Captain

04:54.460 --> 04:55.791
when she's being
overprotective.

04:55.862 --> 04:56.954
l'll do that.

04:57.030 --> 04:58.964
Thanks again
for minding the store.

04:59.098 --> 05:01.965
Even the Captain deserves
a vacation once in a while.

05:02.068 --> 05:03.399
And her First Officer?

05:03.503 --> 05:06.370
He's looking forward to putting
his feet up on your desk.

05:10.443 --> 05:11.569
Chakotay.

05:11.644 --> 05:14.044
Fun last night, wasn't it?

05:14.113 --> 05:15.842
There's another match
scheduled at 1500.

05:15.915 --> 05:17.883
l've got a systems diagnostic.

05:18.017 --> 05:19.712
Correct me if l'm wrong,
but you're in command

05:19.786 --> 05:20.810
until the Captain gets back.

05:20.887 --> 05:22.286
What's your point?

05:22.355 --> 05:23.379
Delegate.

05:23.456 --> 05:25.219
l happen to know that
Harry's free this afternoon.

05:25.291 --> 05:26.622
Lieutenant,
you're not suggesting

05:26.693 --> 05:28.524
l abuse my power.

05:29.996 --> 05:33.397
Tell me that's not lunch.

05:33.466 --> 05:37.300
lt's leola ointment
for my skin.

05:37.403 --> 05:38.870
What happened?

05:38.938 --> 05:40.701
l was so excited to visit

05:40.773 --> 05:43.936
one of those beautiful
Norcadian beaches, uh,

05:44.010 --> 05:46.570
that l forgot to take
my dermaline hypospray.

05:46.646 --> 05:48.944
l fell asleep...

05:49.048 --> 05:52.347
under two suns.

05:52.418 --> 05:53.544
Ouch.

05:54.987 --> 05:57.717
A little more color
than l was hoping for,

05:57.790 --> 06:00.884
but it'll be a beautiful amber
before you know it.

06:00.993 --> 06:03.518
How's your shore leave been?

06:03.596 --> 06:07.532
Well, we've spent the last few
days at the Tsunkatse matches.

06:07.600 --> 06:09.090
Tsunkatse.

06:09.168 --> 06:12.262
l heard some crewmen talking
about that during breakfast.

06:12.372 --> 06:13.339
lt's exciting--

06:13.439 --> 06:15.236
a real test of
strength and agility.

06:15.308 --> 06:17.970
You should come to the match
with us this afternoon.

06:18.044 --> 06:19.102
From what l've heard,

06:19.178 --> 06:20.839
Tsunkatse is
crude and pointless.

06:20.913 --> 06:23.074
Well, l guess we won't be
saving you a seat.

06:23.149 --> 06:24.241
What about you, Tuvok?

06:24.317 --> 06:25.807
You appreciate the martial arts.

06:25.885 --> 06:27.113
l have other plans.

06:27.186 --> 06:28.244
There's a micronebula

06:28.321 --> 06:29.879
approximately 1.6
light-years from here

06:29.989 --> 06:31.286
on the verge of collapse.

06:31.357 --> 06:33.587
We'd like to take
a shuttle to study it.

06:33.659 --> 06:37.026
Ah. An away mission
during shore leave?

06:37.096 --> 06:40.588
Commander Tuvok and l don't
require recreational activities.

06:40.666 --> 06:41.792
The Borg wouldn't know fun

06:41.901 --> 06:43.630
if they assimilated
an amusement park.

06:45.104 --> 06:47.038
lt's your shore leave,

06:47.106 --> 06:49.574
but try to enjoy yourselves.

06:49.675 --> 06:51.074
That's an order.

07:03.289 --> 07:06.190
Here's the navigational
data you asked for.

07:06.259 --> 07:07.658
Thank you.

07:07.727 --> 07:10.662
How long are you
planning on being gone?

07:10.730 --> 07:12.698
Approximately 48 hours.

07:12.765 --> 07:15.325
Just like B'Elanna.

07:15.435 --> 07:16.402
Clarify.

07:16.502 --> 07:18.629
Well, she overpacks, too.

07:18.738 --> 07:20.603
l haven't overpacked.

07:20.673 --> 07:24.803
l simply wish to be prepared
for any contingency.

07:24.877 --> 07:27.209
And what contingency
is this for?

07:27.280 --> 07:28.872
That's an iso-modulator,

07:29.015 --> 07:32.314
enhanced to correct hull
ablation in the event

07:32.385 --> 07:34.683
we encounter
a meteoroid stream.

07:34.754 --> 07:38.053
Well, couldn't you just
replicate an iso-modulator?

07:38.124 --> 07:39.455
l prefer this one.

07:39.525 --> 07:41.049
Oh, l get it.

07:41.127 --> 07:43.220
You like to have your
own things with you.

07:43.296 --> 07:44.490
B'Elanna's the same way.

07:44.564 --> 07:45.861
You know, she'd never admit it,

07:45.932 --> 07:47.900
but she still takes
a stuffed animal with her

07:48.034 --> 07:49.763
whenever she's
going to be away

07:49.869 --> 07:50.995
for more than a day.

07:51.103 --> 07:53.401
Toby the targ.

07:53.473 --> 07:56.909
Can Toby the targ
correct hull ablation?

07:57.076 --> 07:59.442
Your comparison is flawed.

08:05.418 --> 08:07.215
Just the person
l was looking for.

08:07.286 --> 08:08.514
You require my assistance?

08:08.588 --> 08:09.520
Your company.

08:09.589 --> 08:11.079
l was wondering if you'd care

08:11.157 --> 08:12.215
to join me on a tour

08:12.291 --> 08:14.054
of Norcadia's
cultural hot spots.

08:14.126 --> 08:15.184
l hear their museums

08:15.261 --> 08:17.161
are among the finest
in this sector.

08:17.230 --> 08:18.162
l'm busy.

08:18.231 --> 08:19.163
With what?

08:19.232 --> 08:20.529
Commander Tuvok and l
are leaving

08:20.600 --> 08:21.999
to study a collapsing
micronebula.

08:22.101 --> 08:23.659
During shore leave?

08:24.971 --> 08:27.769
l thought we'd discussed this.

08:27.840 --> 08:30.274
Shore leave is
a perfect opportunity

08:30.343 --> 08:31.776
for you to spend time
with other members

08:31.844 --> 08:33.674
of the crew to develop
your social skills.

08:33.746 --> 08:35.407
Then l suppose l'll have

08:35.481 --> 08:37.346
to develop them
with Commander Tuvok.

08:37.416 --> 08:42.115
Vulcans aren't exactly known
for their winning personalities.

08:42.188 --> 08:44.087
You'd prefer l spent my time

08:44.155 --> 08:47.557
with more sociable individuals,
such as yourself?

08:47.627 --> 08:49.891
You could do worse.

08:49.996 --> 08:51.190
ln that case,

08:51.264 --> 08:53.289
perhaps you'd care to join us.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.163
To study the micronebula?

08:55.268 --> 08:57.065
You can assist us
with our analysis

08:57.169 --> 08:58.796
of veridium-oxide particulates.

08:58.905 --> 09:00.839
On second thought,

09:01.007 --> 09:04.238
you and Tuvok have a good time.

09:04.310 --> 09:06.801
l'll give the Commander
your regrets.

09:06.879 --> 09:08.005
Uh, do that.

09:08.080 --> 09:10.548
And if the nebula
isn't as riveting

09:10.616 --> 09:13.608
as you'd hoped,
try to remember Lesson 36--

09:13.686 --> 09:16.553
''Pleasant Parlor Games
to Pass the Time.''

09:17.990 --> 09:20.151
You'll need it.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.872
Two hours, 37 minutes,
13 seconds.

09:37.009 --> 09:38.772
That's how long we've gone

09:38.844 --> 09:40.835
without verbal communication.

09:40.913 --> 09:43.473
Why is that remarkable?

09:43.549 --> 09:46.882
The Doctor encourages me
to engage in conversation

09:46.953 --> 09:48.545
during awkward silences.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.983
Did you find
the silence awkward?

09:54.594 --> 09:56.391
No.

09:56.462 --> 09:58.362
Nor did l.

10:01.434 --> 10:04.062
There's a vessel approaching
on an intercept course.

10:04.170 --> 10:06.229
The hull configuration
is unfamiliar.

10:06.339 --> 10:07.806
Distance?

10:07.907 --> 10:10.375
Approximately
300,000 kilometers.

10:10.443 --> 10:12.308
Hail them.

10:12.378 --> 10:15.245
No response.

10:20.853 --> 10:23.413
Tuvok to Voyager.

10:23.489 --> 10:24.717
The vessel is emitting

10:24.790 --> 10:26.485
some kind of dampening field.

10:26.559 --> 10:27.685
We've lost engines,

10:27.760 --> 10:30.058
weapons, shields.

10:42.708 --> 10:45.506
lt's an explosive device
of some sort.

10:45.578 --> 10:47.603
Transporters are down.
l can't beam it off.

10:47.680 --> 10:50.581
l'll try to disarm it.

11:01.661 --> 11:05.597
Borg-enhanced physiology.

11:05.665 --> 11:08.896
You should have
superior strength, agility,

11:09.035 --> 11:10.525
stamina,

11:10.636 --> 11:12.160
visual acuity.

11:14.740 --> 11:16.674
Welcome to Tsunkatse.

11:16.742 --> 11:18.471
Since the game's inception,

11:18.544 --> 11:21.069
our audience has never had
the pleasure

11:21.147 --> 11:22.808
of seeing a
drone compete.

11:22.882 --> 11:28.946
You are going to be
a very popular attraction.

11:36.729 --> 11:38.253
Where is Commander Tuvok?

11:38.330 --> 11:40.491
Your comrade
from the shuttle?

11:40.566 --> 11:41.498
l'm afraid he was

11:41.567 --> 11:42.864
injured in the explosion.

11:42.968 --> 11:45.937
l wish to see him now.

11:46.005 --> 11:47.438
Certainly.

11:49.275 --> 11:51.937
You'll learn nothing
is more important to me

11:52.011 --> 11:54.411
than the comfort and happiness
of my fighters.

11:54.480 --> 11:56.243
Yes, Penk's

11:56.315 --> 12:00.376
generosity is... legendary.

12:01.921 --> 12:04.583
Quiet!

12:04.657 --> 12:09.458
He's envious because l've found
a new favorite.

12:09.528 --> 12:12.554
l have no intention
of participating in your game.

12:12.631 --> 12:13.893
Aggressive.

12:13.966 --> 12:15.433
l like that.

12:25.411 --> 12:27.208
He requires medical attention.

12:27.279 --> 12:28.576
That can be arranged.

12:28.647 --> 12:30.638
Then arrange it.

12:30.716 --> 12:31.944
You haven't won a single bout

12:32.051 --> 12:33.518
and already
you're making demands

12:33.586 --> 12:34.518
like a champion.

12:34.587 --> 12:35.884
Will you treat him or not?

12:35.955 --> 12:37.923
Will you fight?

12:37.990 --> 12:40.356
Do not comply.

12:40.426 --> 12:42.860
My condition is not severe.

12:42.928 --> 12:44.657
Spoken like
a true competitor,

12:44.730 --> 12:46.527
willing to ignore his injuries

12:46.599 --> 12:48.123
for the sake of the contest.

12:48.200 --> 12:49.565
Schedule a bout for him.

12:49.668 --> 12:50.566
A Red Match

12:50.669 --> 12:51.931
against the Pensarkan.

12:52.037 --> 12:53.971
A Red Match

12:54.039 --> 12:57.304
does not end until one
of the competitors is killed.

12:57.376 --> 13:00.311
Your friend would not survive.

13:00.379 --> 13:02.108
But you might.

13:02.181 --> 13:05.708
Give her a Blue Match, Penk.

13:05.785 --> 13:08.117
You wouldn't want to lose
your new favorite

13:08.187 --> 13:09.848
her first time in the pit.

13:12.658 --> 13:15.957
Yes. We should
start you off slowly.

13:20.132 --> 13:21.895
Treat him...

13:22.034 --> 13:25.197
and l will comply.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.303
What about
the seventh match?

13:35.381 --> 13:36.848
l'm picking the Vensiddian.

13:36.916 --> 13:38.543
He lost his last two times out.

13:38.617 --> 13:41.211
But he's undefeated
against left-handed fighters.

13:41.287 --> 13:42.845
You should trust him, Harry.

13:42.922 --> 13:45.618
Chakotay knows a thing or two
about southpaws.

13:45.691 --> 13:48.353
He was 23 and 0
as a light heavyweight.

13:48.427 --> 13:49.917
23 and one,
actually...

13:49.995 --> 13:52.463
a Nausicaan with
a mean right hook.

13:52.531 --> 13:53.623
You think that's bad?

13:53.699 --> 13:55.462
Try taking a parrises
mallet to the ribs.

13:55.568 --> 13:57.092
l didn't know you played.

13:57.203 --> 13:59.637
Three-time Academy champion.

13:59.705 --> 14:01.070
Now, that's a tough sport.

14:01.173 --> 14:02.765
l boxed a few parrises players
in my day.

14:02.842 --> 14:05.436
And?

14:05.511 --> 14:07.138
Let's just say
they went back

14:07.213 --> 14:09.511
to playing parrises
squares after that.

14:10.816 --> 14:12.681
Oh, is that a challenge,
Commander?

14:12.751 --> 14:14.184
l wouldn't want

14:14.253 --> 14:16.653
to put my Ops Officer out
of commission, now, would l?

14:16.722 --> 14:19.282
Oh... l can take a punch.

14:19.358 --> 14:20.689
Careful, Harry.

14:20.759 --> 14:22.886
Legend has it that
the ''Tattooed Terror''

14:23.028 --> 14:25.792
has put more men in Sick Bay
than the Ankaran flu.

14:25.865 --> 14:29.392
Yeah, you wouldn't want
to bruise your clarinet fingers.

14:30.803 --> 14:33.397
Hey, you want
to go a few rounds

14:33.505 --> 14:34.472
or all you all talk?

14:34.540 --> 14:37.008
Any time, any place.

14:37.109 --> 14:38.974
Oh, you punch like a Ferengi.

14:43.749 --> 14:45.546
l don't care what Harry says.

14:45.618 --> 14:47.950
The Pensarkan-Bendali match
is too close to call.

14:48.087 --> 14:49.748
l'll let you know
how it turns out.

14:49.822 --> 14:50.948
Excuse me?

14:51.090 --> 14:53.684
l rearranged the duty
schedules this morning.

14:53.759 --> 14:56.421
You've got the Bridge
starting at 1400 hours.

14:56.495 --> 14:58.122
You're sticking me
with that shift

14:58.197 --> 14:59.755
so that you can go to the fight.

14:59.832 --> 15:01.697
l'm delegating.

15:01.800 --> 15:03.791
Oh, me and my big mouth.

15:03.836 --> 15:07.829
l thought you'd be pleased
that l took your advice.

15:07.973 --> 15:08.940
Words fail me.

15:09.041 --> 15:10.030
Now, remind me.

15:10.142 --> 15:11.336
The reason that you have

15:11.410 --> 15:13.037
to see that fight
is because...?

15:13.112 --> 15:14.807
l'm an anthropologist.

15:14.880 --> 15:17.041
What does that have
to do with Tsunkatse?

15:17.116 --> 15:18.583
lt's a cultural phenomenon.

15:23.455 --> 15:26.481
You're having
an allergic reaction

15:26.558 --> 15:28.685
to your leola ointment.

15:28.761 --> 15:30.592
l hope you've
learned your lesson.

15:30.663 --> 15:31.652
Talaxian homeopathy

15:31.730 --> 15:33.755
is no substitute
for medical science.

15:33.832 --> 15:36.630
This should help with the
swelling and discoloration.

15:36.735 --> 15:37.759
Ow.

15:37.870 --> 15:39.531
But you'll have
to stay out of the sun.

15:39.638 --> 15:41.538
But what about the rest
of my shore leave?

15:41.607 --> 15:44.269
l suggest you limit it
to indoor activities.

15:44.343 --> 15:47.312
Commander Chakotay
and B'Elanna invited me

15:47.379 --> 15:49.142
to the Tsunkatse matches.

15:49.214 --> 15:50.340
l guess l'll go.

15:50.416 --> 15:52.316
l'm disappointed in
you, Mr. Neelix.

15:52.384 --> 15:53.942
Cheering for one individual

15:54.086 --> 15:55.917
to inflict
serious injury on another

15:55.988 --> 15:58.149
hardly seems like
an activity you'd enjoy.

15:58.223 --> 16:00.054
Well, Commander Chakotay
says that it's

16:00.125 --> 16:02.685
a wonderful demonstration
of athletic prowess.

16:02.761 --> 16:04.058
You seem to be forgetting

16:04.129 --> 16:06.654
that Commander Chakotay is
an aficionado of boxing,

16:06.732 --> 16:09.428
arguably the most barbaric sport
in Earth's history.

16:09.535 --> 16:11.366
Surely you can find some way
to occupy your free time

16:11.470 --> 16:13.768
that doesn't involve
alien fisticuffs.

16:13.839 --> 16:16.103
Do you have any suggestions?

16:16.175 --> 16:18.643
As a matter of fact,
l was planning a visit

16:18.744 --> 16:20.871
to the Norcadian
Museum of Entomology

16:20.946 --> 16:21.878
this afternoon.

16:21.947 --> 16:24.643
There's a fascinating
exhibit of beetle larvae

16:24.717 --> 16:26.617
from the equatorial
subcontinent.

16:26.685 --> 16:28.152
You're welcome to join me.

16:28.220 --> 16:32.782
Hmm, alien bugs
or alien fisticuffs.

16:32.858 --> 16:34.985
Oh, that's a tough one.

16:35.094 --> 16:37.085
Tsunkat! Tsunkat!

16:46.071 --> 16:48.369
Tsunkat! Tsunkat! Tsunkat!

16:48.440 --> 16:52.376
Tsunkat! Tsunkat! Tsunkat!
Tsunkat! Tsunkat!

17:06.224 --> 17:07.817
You were right, Commander.

17:07.893 --> 17:08.916
This is exciting.

17:08.993 --> 17:10.154
Two opponents alone

17:10.229 --> 17:11.820
in the pit with
only their strength

17:11.896 --> 17:13.387
and agility to protect them.

17:13.464 --> 17:15.830
l'm glad
you're enjoying yourself.

17:15.934 --> 17:17.299
l still don't understand
the rules.

17:17.403 --> 17:18.801
lt's simple.

17:18.871 --> 17:21.532
A Tsunkatse fighter wears
a polaron disruptor on both

17:21.640 --> 17:23.631
hands and feet.
Each disruptor delivers

17:23.742 --> 17:26.575
a bioplasmic charge
when it comes in contact with

17:26.645 --> 17:28.237
one of the opponent's
target sensors.

17:28.313 --> 17:29.644
So there is strategy involved.

17:29.715 --> 17:32.240
A fighter has to attack
his rival's sensors

17:32.317 --> 17:33.807
without exposing his own.

17:33.886 --> 17:36.047
Are you two going to talk
or you here to watch?

18:12.024 --> 18:14.424
He looks like he could
pick up a shuttlecraft.

18:14.493 --> 18:15.585
He's a Pendari.

18:15.661 --> 18:17.652
They're known for
their superior strength.

18:17.729 --> 18:18.661
And their bad temper.

18:18.730 --> 18:20.129
l hear they have a tendency

18:20.199 --> 18:22.326
to throw their opponents
into the stands.

18:22.434 --> 18:23.765
Be ready to duck.

18:40.319 --> 18:42.116
Seven?

18:54.166 --> 18:56.031
Seven!

18:56.135 --> 18:57.602
Seven!

18:59.505 --> 19:01.700
You're no bigger than
a Tarkanian field mouse.

19:01.807 --> 19:06.176
Penk's insulting me by putting
you in the pit to face me.

19:06.211 --> 19:08.702
l must warn you,
l possess superior strength.

19:08.780 --> 19:10.873
l'm trembling.

19:15.487 --> 19:17.512
Seven!

19:17.589 --> 19:19.648
Seven!

19:19.725 --> 19:21.124
Seven!

19:22.528 --> 19:25.463
l assure you,
resistance is futile.

19:25.531 --> 19:27.465
So is all your talk.

19:31.570 --> 19:32.537
Seven!

19:32.638 --> 19:34.868
lt's no use.
She can't hear us.

19:35.007 --> 19:36.872
Chakotay to Voyager.

19:36.975 --> 19:37.964
Come in.

19:38.076 --> 19:40.169
Calling to give me
a blow-by-blow description

19:40.245 --> 19:41.234
of the match, Commander?

19:41.313 --> 19:43.042
Seven of Nine is in the pit.

19:43.115 --> 19:44.047
What?

19:44.116 --> 19:45.048
No time to explain.

19:45.117 --> 19:46.209
Beam her out of there!

19:58.096 --> 20:00.656
l have no desire to
inflict further damage.

20:00.732 --> 20:02.666
l'm afraid l can't say the same.

20:12.511 --> 20:14.376
l'm locked onto
the coordinates of the pit.

20:14.446 --> 20:15.413
Seven's not there.

20:15.480 --> 20:16.640
l'm looking right at her!

20:16.715 --> 20:18.478
Not according to these sensors.

20:18.550 --> 20:20.484
Maybe their life signs
are masked.

20:20.552 --> 20:22.918
Try recalibrating
the bio-scanners.

20:22.988 --> 20:24.717
Acknowledged.

20:27.192 --> 20:28.921
There's nothing to lock on to.

20:28.994 --> 20:31.656
The only readings l'm picking up
are photonic.

20:31.730 --> 20:32.662
Holograms?

20:32.731 --> 20:34.096
They're transmitting the fight

20:34.166 --> 20:35.224
from another location.

20:58.857 --> 21:01.451
Transmission to one of
the arenas on Norcadia Prime

21:01.560 --> 21:03.391
is being disrupted.

21:03.428 --> 21:04.861
Compensate.

21:29.688 --> 21:31.155
Tsunkat! Tsunkat!

21:31.223 --> 21:34.056
Tsunkat! Tsunkat!
Tsunkat! Tsunkat!

21:34.126 --> 21:37.721
Tsunkat! Tsunkat!
Tsunkat! Tsunkat! Tsunkat!

21:37.796 --> 21:38.956
Tsunkat! Tsunkat!

21:39.064 --> 21:42.761
Voyager, four to beam up.

21:47.539 --> 21:49.734
We've scanned
the Norcadian surface, Captain.

21:49.808 --> 21:51.002
There's no sign of them.

21:51.076 --> 21:52.668
Any luck
tracing the transmission?

21:52.744 --> 21:54.644
We're trying, but it's not easy.

21:54.713 --> 21:55.645
There are transmissions

21:55.714 --> 21:57.306
being sent to every
planet in the sector.

21:57.382 --> 22:00.180
l guess you aren't the only ones
who enjoy this sport.

22:00.252 --> 22:01.879
lt could take days
before we can figure out

22:01.953 --> 22:03.352
where Seven and Tuvok
are being held.

22:03.422 --> 22:04.753
What about diplomatic channels?

22:04.823 --> 22:07.257
Neelix is meeting with a group
of Norcadian officials.

22:07.326 --> 22:09.453
Well, let's hope he gets
their cooperation.

22:09.528 --> 22:11.393
When can we
expect you back?

22:11.463 --> 22:13.624
l'm at the outer rim
of the Pendari system.

22:13.699 --> 22:15.064
At best, l'm 48 hours away.

22:15.167 --> 22:17.499
Sorry to cut your
vacation short.

22:17.602 --> 22:19.263
That's okay, Commander.

22:19.371 --> 22:21.066
Keep me informed. Janeway out.

22:33.118 --> 22:34.847
Stay away from me.

22:34.920 --> 22:37.354
lt's a dermal regenerator.

22:37.422 --> 22:39.913
The Pendari you
fought injured you.

22:39.991 --> 22:40.958
Now, keep still.

22:41.026 --> 22:42.960
lt's almost out of power.

22:43.061 --> 22:45.586
l'd prefer that you use it
to treat Commander Tuvok.

22:45.664 --> 22:46.756
l already have.

22:46.832 --> 22:48.823
He's sleeping.

22:50.369 --> 22:51.802
Why are you helping us?

22:51.870 --> 22:55.431
l recognize fellow hunters
when l see them.

22:55.540 --> 22:56.973
l'm no hunter.

22:59.444 --> 23:01.810
l saw your match today.

23:01.913 --> 23:03.904
Your skills are impressive.

23:04.015 --> 23:07.075
The Pendari would disagree.

23:07.152 --> 23:10.053
You almost defeated him,
but at the last moment,

23:10.122 --> 23:11.214
you hesitated.

23:11.289 --> 23:13.052
You... questioned
your desire

23:13.125 --> 23:15.059
to destroy your prey.

23:15.127 --> 23:17.721
l have no such desire.

23:17.796 --> 23:20.697
Don't you?

23:20.766 --> 23:23.257
l thought l saw it in your eyes.

23:23.368 --> 23:25.598
With the proper training,

23:25.704 --> 23:27.399
you could become a champion.

23:27.506 --> 23:29.531
Until our ship comes
to rescue us,

23:29.641 --> 23:31.336
my only goal is to survive.

23:31.410 --> 23:34.538
Do you know the difference

23:34.613 --> 23:38.879
between a survivor
and a champion here?

23:38.950 --> 23:40.884
There isn't one.

23:45.891 --> 23:49.156
l wanted to be the first
to congratulate you.

23:49.227 --> 23:50.717
l lost.

23:50.796 --> 23:52.127
Exactly.

23:52.197 --> 23:54.961
There's a great deal
of hostility toward the Borg

23:55.100 --> 23:56.533
in this sector.

23:56.635 --> 23:59.866
Whenever the Pendari landed
a blow, our audience grew.

23:59.971 --> 24:03.270
We're getting
tens of thousands of requests

24:03.375 --> 24:05.036
to see you fight again.

24:05.076 --> 24:06.668
She needs time
to recuperate--

24:06.745 --> 24:09.839
to prepare for her next bout.

24:09.915 --> 24:11.405
l agree.

24:11.483 --> 24:14.077
There's a Red Match scheduled
for the day after tomorrow.

24:14.152 --> 24:15.813
The Pendari
was supposed to compete,

24:15.887 --> 24:17.582
but l've entered
you in his place.

24:21.326 --> 24:25.820
lf three billion people paid
to see you hurt,

24:25.897 --> 24:29.128
imagine how many will pay
to see you die.

24:34.306 --> 24:37.503
Survival may be more difficult
than l imagined.

24:37.576 --> 24:40.204
You will win the match.

24:40.278 --> 24:41.939
What makes you say that?

24:42.080 --> 24:45.538
l know your opponent;
l know his weaknesses.

24:45.617 --> 24:48.051
l can train you to defeat him.

24:48.119 --> 24:51.282
l told you, l will not kill
anyone in that arena.

24:51.356 --> 24:53.654
Consider the alternative.

25:08.106 --> 25:09.573
Teach me.

25:18.917 --> 25:20.748
You're letting
your elbow fall,

25:20.819 --> 25:22.514
exposing your target.

25:22.587 --> 25:23.519
You're mistaken.

25:23.588 --> 25:25.419
My arm is positioned properly.

25:25.490 --> 25:26.980
''When executing
the Tanyk Defense,

25:27.058 --> 25:28.525
''the blocking elbow must remain

25:28.593 --> 25:30.151
parallel
to the median sensor.''

25:30.228 --> 25:31.718
Ah, the Book of Tsunkatse.

25:31.796 --> 25:34.094
Commander Tuvok borrowed it
from one of the other fighters.

25:34.165 --> 25:37.191
lt is obvious
you've studied it well.

25:37.302 --> 25:38.769
l'm attempting to perfect
a defense against...

25:41.973 --> 25:43.736
That was not one

25:43.808 --> 25:45.366
of the 33
sanctioned maneuvers.

25:45.477 --> 25:47.308
There must be 34.

25:47.379 --> 25:49.779
l was unprepared
for your attack.

25:49.848 --> 25:52.146
ls that what you're going to say
to your opponent?

25:52.217 --> 25:54.708
Stop thinking like a drone.

25:54.786 --> 25:56.083
Sanctioned maneuvers,

25:56.154 --> 25:57.951
perfecting defenses.

25:58.023 --> 26:01.322
You cannot assimilate Tsunkatse
from a book.

26:01.393 --> 26:04.021
You must live it, feel it.

26:05.997 --> 26:07.225
ln here.

26:07.299 --> 26:09.665
Your movements

26:09.768 --> 26:12.202
must become instinct.

26:12.270 --> 26:15.501
An attack could come at any time
from any direction.

26:15.574 --> 26:18.543
You must learn to improvise.

26:18.610 --> 26:19.668
Like this?

26:21.446 --> 26:24.643
l've observed you often favor
your left side.

26:24.716 --> 26:27.480
Very perceptive.

26:27.552 --> 26:31.249
lt's a wound l sustained
in one of my first matches.

26:31.323 --> 26:34.724
After 19 years,
it still hasn't healed properly.

26:37.162 --> 26:39.289
You've been here a long time.

26:39.364 --> 26:44.734
l was taken during
my son's first hunt.

26:44.836 --> 26:47.896
He was so proud
to be with his father.

26:48.039 --> 26:50.940
Watching every
movement l made,

26:51.076 --> 26:52.543
imitating my gestures.

26:52.644 --> 26:54.942
But instead of bringing
home his first trophy,

26:55.080 --> 26:59.107
he saw his father become
someone else's prey.

26:59.184 --> 27:00.742
Do you know
what happened to him?

27:00.852 --> 27:04.049
l never saw him again.

27:04.089 --> 27:05.750
All Penk would say

27:05.824 --> 27:10.261
was that the boy was
too small for competition.

27:10.328 --> 27:13.422
Perhaps he managed
to return home.

27:16.468 --> 27:18.060
You let down your defenses.

27:18.169 --> 27:19.329
Why?

27:19.437 --> 27:21.064
-l was...
-What?

27:21.172 --> 27:22.799
Feeling sorry for me?

27:22.907 --> 27:24.067
My tragic past?

27:24.142 --> 27:25.109
Yes.

27:25.210 --> 27:27.678
You must never sympathize

27:27.779 --> 27:28.871
with your prey.

27:29.014 --> 27:30.675
Unless you accept that,

27:30.749 --> 27:33.650
you will die.

27:36.655 --> 27:38.122
We'll continue.

28:02.213 --> 28:04.181
How did it go?

28:04.249 --> 28:05.614
Oh, the Norcadians

28:05.684 --> 28:08.050
were shocked to learn
that off-worlders might be

28:08.119 --> 28:09.746
participating against
their will.

28:09.821 --> 28:11.584
Uh, the Ambassador
promised to begin

28:11.656 --> 28:12.714
an immediate investigation.

28:12.791 --> 28:14.452
You don't sound too convinced.

28:14.526 --> 28:15.584
l'm not.

28:15.660 --> 28:17.787
l spoke to one
of the Pendari delegates.

28:17.862 --> 28:18.954
According to him,

28:19.030 --> 28:20.691
a huge percentage
of the planet's revenue

28:20.765 --> 28:23.097
is derived from Tsunkatse.

28:23.201 --> 28:24.293
Nobody wants to do anything

28:24.402 --> 28:25.960
that might interfere
with the game.

28:26.071 --> 28:27.003
So they turn a blind eye

28:27.072 --> 28:28.096
to the recruitment tactics.

28:28.206 --> 28:29.673
We're not going to get any help

28:29.741 --> 28:31.003
through official channels.

28:31.076 --> 28:33.636
lt's hard to believe
a-a-a civilization

28:33.712 --> 28:35.680
whose favorite pastime
is cheering

28:35.747 --> 28:37.874
while innocent people
fight each other.

28:38.016 --> 28:39.847
lf Seven and Tuvok
hadn't been abducted,

28:39.918 --> 28:42.785
we might still
be cheering, too.

28:49.027 --> 28:50.892
What have you got?

28:50.962 --> 28:53.089
Well, one of the reasons
we were having trouble

28:53.164 --> 28:55.223
isolating the source
of the transmissions

28:55.300 --> 28:57.393
was because they never
seem to be coming

28:57.502 --> 28:58.799
from the same place twice.

28:58.903 --> 29:00.495
At first, we thought
the matches were

29:00.605 --> 29:02.072
being held in
various locations.

29:02.173 --> 29:04.539
But when we
connected the dots,

29:04.609 --> 29:07.442
we realized the pattern
conformed to a flight path.

29:07.512 --> 29:09.412
One that spanned
the entire sector.

29:09.481 --> 29:11.915
They're transmitting
the fights from a ship.

29:11.983 --> 29:13.951
Like a traveling carnival.

29:14.018 --> 29:15.485
Oh, this is no carnival.

29:15.553 --> 29:16.952
Five million metric tons,

29:17.021 --> 29:18.545
reinforced hull plating

29:18.623 --> 29:20.454
protected
by covariant shielding,

29:20.525 --> 29:22.288
neutronic weaponry.

29:22.360 --> 29:24.794
lt's way out
of our weight class.

29:24.863 --> 29:26.626
The bigger they come,
Lieutenant.

29:26.698 --> 29:28.563
Transmit these coordinates
to the Captain.

29:28.633 --> 29:30.533
Tell her we could use a hand.

29:58.196 --> 29:59.663
Excellent.

29:59.731 --> 30:01.358
When your opponent
enters the arena,

30:01.432 --> 30:02.694
what do you see?

30:02.801 --> 30:03.859
My prey.

30:03.968 --> 30:05.902
And what do you do to your prey?

30:05.970 --> 30:08.495
Hunt it down and kill it.

30:12.911 --> 30:15.277
Go rest before your match.

30:22.620 --> 30:23.951
Thank you.

30:24.055 --> 30:26.546
Thank me...

30:26.624 --> 30:29.092
by winning.

30:34.399 --> 30:37.960
Penk's guards are making
their inspection rounds.

30:38.069 --> 30:39.434
Progress?

30:39.504 --> 30:41.904
Both the dampening field
and the shielding

30:41.973 --> 30:43.838
of this vessel
are tetryon-based.

30:43.908 --> 30:45.933
But without access to
the control interface,

30:46.044 --> 30:48.444
l can't disable either.

30:48.513 --> 30:50.105
Your training?

30:50.181 --> 30:51.648
Complete.

30:51.716 --> 30:55.277
Are you adequately prepared?

30:55.353 --> 30:57.514
The Hirogen
is an efficient instructor.

30:57.589 --> 30:59.022
He believes l'll win.

30:59.157 --> 31:01.216
That troubles you.

31:01.326 --> 31:03.385
The idea of killing someone

31:03.428 --> 31:05.658
for the entertainment
of others is detestable.

31:05.730 --> 31:08.699
ls the idea
of losing your own life

31:08.766 --> 31:10.825
for the entertainment of others
more palatable?

31:10.935 --> 31:12.869
As a drone,

31:12.937 --> 31:14.427
you took many lives.

31:14.539 --> 31:16.700
l was acting as part
of the collective.

31:16.808 --> 31:19.538
You're worried
you won't have the strength

31:19.611 --> 31:21.875
to accomplish the task
on your own.

31:21.946 --> 31:25.006
l'm worried that l will.

31:34.459 --> 31:36.256
lt's time.

31:41.666 --> 31:45.796
Do whatever it takes
to survive.

33:04.215 --> 33:05.978
You knew.

33:06.050 --> 33:07.779
Yes.

33:10.989 --> 33:12.786
Training me was a deception.

33:12.857 --> 33:15.519
You wished to familiarize
yourself with my weaknesses.

33:15.593 --> 33:18.858
l was helping you
to overcome them.

33:18.930 --> 33:19.862
Why?

33:21.699 --> 33:25.157
19 years is a long time.

33:25.236 --> 33:26.669
l've grown tired.

33:26.738 --> 33:29.070
You wish to be killed
in the arena.

33:29.140 --> 33:31.938
l want a death my son

33:32.043 --> 33:33.169
would be proud of.

33:33.244 --> 33:35.303
l won't be the one
to provide it.

33:37.048 --> 33:39.915
Then l'll be forced
to kill you.

33:39.984 --> 33:40.973
Ya!

33:52.563 --> 33:53.860
Approaching the vessel.

33:53.931 --> 33:54.955
Take us out of warp.

33:55.099 --> 33:56.896
Raise shields
and charge weapons.

33:57.001 --> 33:58.525
Any sign of Tuvok and Seven?

33:58.636 --> 34:01.104
Our sensors can't penetrate
their shields.

34:01.205 --> 34:02.934
Hail them.

34:05.510 --> 34:08.001
This is not a convenient time.

34:08.079 --> 34:10.547
l'm Commander Chakotay
of the Starship Voyager.

34:10.614 --> 34:12.275
You're holding
two of my people.

34:12.350 --> 34:14.409
You'll have to be more specific.

34:14.485 --> 34:17.112
Commander Tuvok
and Seven of Nine.

34:17.188 --> 34:18.449
Return them, now.

34:18.523 --> 34:20.547
The Borg drone and her friend.

34:20.625 --> 34:23.321
l'm afraid
she's occupied at the moment.

34:23.393 --> 34:25.692
You have 30 seconds
before l open fire.

34:27.297 --> 34:28.731
A fighter.

34:28.800 --> 34:32.292
l respect that,
but you're no match for me.

34:45.416 --> 34:47.782
We can still find
another way out of this.

34:47.851 --> 34:49.649
There is no other way.

34:50.588 --> 34:51.850
You're still

34:51.922 --> 34:53.618
dropping your elbow.

34:57.628 --> 35:00.927
Make a choice,
hunter or prey?

35:03.434 --> 35:05.527
Hunter or prey?

35:27.158 --> 35:29.786
Direct hit to their
aft shield generators.

35:29.861 --> 35:30.850
Still no sign of Seven,

35:30.928 --> 35:32.088
but l've got a lock on Tuvok.

35:32.163 --> 35:33.255
Beam him to Sick Bay.

35:33.331 --> 35:34.355
Keep targeting

35:34.432 --> 35:36.297
those generators.

35:36.367 --> 35:38.028
Transport complete.

35:38.136 --> 35:39.125
Bridge to Tuvok.

35:39.237 --> 35:40.534
Go ahead, Commander.

35:40.605 --> 35:42.402
Do you know Seven's status?

35:42.473 --> 35:45.909
She's being forced to fight...
to the death.

35:46.043 --> 35:48.409
l believe
they're on the uppermost deck.

35:48.479 --> 35:50.606
That section's protected
by multiphasic force fields.

35:50.681 --> 35:51.648
l can't penetrate them.

35:54.519 --> 35:56.214
Shields down to 40 percent.

35:57.188 --> 35:59.418
32 percent.

36:01.792 --> 36:03.316
You're getting weak.

36:04.328 --> 36:06.421
l should have found
worthier prey.

36:12.837 --> 36:16.170
You're imperfect.

36:23.748 --> 36:25.773
ls that the best you can do?

36:35.760 --> 36:37.284
Shields are down.

36:37.361 --> 36:39.329
Evasive maneuvers.

36:39.397 --> 36:40.364
Harry?

36:40.431 --> 36:41.398
Still can't get a lock.

36:41.465 --> 36:42.659
Should l get us out of here

36:42.733 --> 36:44.360
before they knock out
our propulsion?

36:44.468 --> 36:45.435
Not yet.

36:45.503 --> 36:46.663
lf we can't beam her out,

36:46.771 --> 36:48.466
maybe we can shut down
the transmission.

36:48.573 --> 36:50.905
lf nobody's watching,
then why continue the fight?

36:50.975 --> 36:52.840
Start targeting
their signal generators.

36:52.910 --> 36:55.071
Hull breach on Deck 1 1.

36:55.146 --> 36:56.078
Seal it.

37:02.353 --> 37:04.981
Tsunkat! Tsunkat! Tsunkat!

37:06.090 --> 37:07.785
We've lost weapons.

37:07.858 --> 37:10.224
Another vessel is approaching.

37:10.294 --> 37:12.319
Great. Now they're
bringing in reinforcements.

37:12.396 --> 37:13.795
No, this one's on our side.

37:13.864 --> 37:15.593
lt's the Delta Flyer.

37:22.540 --> 37:24.269
Good to see you, Captain.

37:24.342 --> 37:27.209
Nothing like getting back
to work after a long vacation.

37:27.278 --> 37:29.644
We need you to target
their signal generators.

37:29.714 --> 37:31.079
Understood.

37:46.731 --> 37:49.666
We've lost more
than half our audience.

37:49.734 --> 37:52.999
Reroute power
to Transmitters 5 and 6.

37:53.104 --> 37:55.334
They've reduced power
to their force fields.

37:55.406 --> 37:57.101
l've got two life
signs in there--

37:57.174 --> 37:58.163
Seven and a Hirogen--

37:58.276 --> 37:59.971
but l can't get
an individual lock.

38:00.077 --> 38:02.011
Transport them both
if you have to.

38:02.046 --> 38:02.978
Tom.

38:03.047 --> 38:05.015
Aye, sir.

38:24.168 --> 38:26.295
Tsunkat! Tsunkat! Tsunkat!

38:26.404 --> 38:30.568
Tsunkat! Tsunkat! Tsunkat!
Tsunkat! Tsunkat!

38:33.110 --> 38:37.046
Never... let your prey suffer.

38:37.114 --> 38:38.581
Kill it.

38:48.626 --> 38:50.651
Seven, stand away.

38:52.396 --> 38:54.330
lt's all right.

38:56.934 --> 38:58.697
This fight is over.

39:15.152 --> 39:19.054
Captain's Log, Stardate 53529.4.

39:19.123 --> 39:21.819
We've resumed course
for the Alpha Quadrant

39:21.926 --> 39:23.325
and initiated repairs.

39:23.394 --> 39:24.759
l can't say l'm sorry

39:24.829 --> 39:27.320
to see this shore leave
come to an end.

39:27.398 --> 39:29.389
We've located
an Hirogen hunting party

39:29.467 --> 39:30.661
three light-years away.

39:30.768 --> 39:32.736
They've agreed
to rendezvous with us.

39:32.803 --> 39:34.634
l'm grateful.

39:39.076 --> 39:41.306
Would you excuse us?

39:42.346 --> 39:43.472
Very well,

39:43.547 --> 39:45.879
but if you should
need anything--

39:46.016 --> 39:48.746
an analgesic,
a phaser rifle...

39:50.354 --> 39:52.515
..don't hesitate to ask.

39:55.393 --> 39:57.054
l apologize for the Doctor.

39:57.128 --> 40:00.791
He's very protective of me.

40:00.865 --> 40:04.892
He doesn't realize how
well you defend yourself.

40:09.707 --> 40:11.470
A trophy.

40:16.547 --> 40:19.516
What will you do now,
search for new prey?

40:19.583 --> 40:24.953
No, this time l will be
searching for my son.

40:25.089 --> 40:27.114
lf he is as clever
as his father,

40:27.191 --> 40:29.159
he may be difficult to locate.

40:29.226 --> 40:31.660
l've been wondering.

40:33.664 --> 40:36.360
Would you have killed me?

40:42.606 --> 40:44.506
l don't know.

40:44.575 --> 40:47.635
Ah...

40:47.711 --> 40:50.179
Fortunately, you were right.

40:50.247 --> 40:52.579
There was another way out.

41:03.694 --> 41:06.891
l thought you might
require assistance.

41:07.031 --> 41:09.090
Thank you.

41:18.876 --> 41:23.540
l realize we share an
affinity for silences,

41:23.614 --> 41:26.105
but in this instance...

41:26.183 --> 41:28.947
l feel compelled to speak.

41:29.019 --> 41:32.147
lf you hadn't offered
to take my place in the arena,

41:32.223 --> 41:34.487
it's likely l would have
been killed.

41:34.558 --> 41:37.823
l made the logical choice,
as you would have.

41:37.895 --> 41:40.921
Still, l owe you
a debt of gratitude.

41:40.998 --> 41:42.431
Assisting me

41:42.500 --> 41:46.834
with these recalibrations
will be sufficient thanks.

41:46.937 --> 41:48.928
Have you fully recovered?

41:49.039 --> 41:51.234
l'm experiencing minor pain

41:51.308 --> 41:53.674
beneath my occipital implant,

41:53.744 --> 41:57.111
but the Doctor believes
it is temporary.

41:57.181 --> 42:00.241
l wasn't referring to
your physical condition.

42:05.556 --> 42:10.118
When the Hirogen referred
to me as weak,

42:10.194 --> 42:11.991
he was correct.

42:13.864 --> 42:15.729
But you overpowered him.

42:15.799 --> 42:17.596
Because l lost control.

42:17.701 --> 42:19.498
Given the circumstances,

42:19.603 --> 42:21.935
your behavior
was understandable.

42:22.072 --> 42:24.540
l've spent the last three years

42:24.608 --> 42:26.974
struggling to regain
my humanity.

42:28.646 --> 42:31.547
l'm afraid l may have
lost it again in that arena.

42:31.615 --> 42:34.948
You're experiencing
difficult emotions.

42:35.019 --> 42:36.486
Guilt...

42:36.554 --> 42:37.816
shame...

42:37.888 --> 42:39.150
remorse.

42:39.223 --> 42:43.592
Then you haven't lost
your humanity.

42:43.661 --> 42:46.562
You have reaffirmed it.
