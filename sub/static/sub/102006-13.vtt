09:26.400 --> 09:28.474
HEN:
You got dizzy
because your heart rate

09:28.627 --> 09:30.143
and blood pressure
suddenly dropped.

09:30.295 --> 09:33.554
Did she mention she was also
experiencing back pains earlier?

09:33.648 --> 09:36.132
SAMPSON:
Her chart shows
back surgery following

09:36.151 --> 09:37.817
a car accident in 2004.

09:37.911 --> 09:40.820
HEN:
I thought she might have been
running a fever earlier.

09:40.972 --> 09:43.397
Henrietta, I'm fine.

09:43.417 --> 09:45.658
Mom, you're in
the emergency room.

09:45.811 --> 09:47.160
Clearly you're not fine.

09:47.329 --> 09:50.330
SAMPSON:
Uh, her temperature
was normal upon admittance.

09:50.482 --> 09:53.166
I mean, this could also be
dehydration, or maybe an allergy

09:53.260 --> 09:54.926
to something
at the farmers market.

09:55.153 --> 09:58.346
Or sometimes people just faint.

09:59.433 --> 10:02.100
That's...
That's it? You...

10:02.327 --> 10:04.010
"People just faint"?

10:04.162 --> 10:06.162
Did you do an-an echo?

10:06.255 --> 10:08.422
An echo isn't indicated.

10:08.516 --> 10:10.500
She should talk
to her primary care physician

10:10.518 --> 10:11.851
about adjusting
her blood pressure medication.

10:11.945 --> 10:15.614
Maybe think about making
some adjustments to her diet.

10:15.765 --> 10:17.023
Could help to lose weight.

10:17.175 --> 10:21.328
And, uh, maybe stay off WebMD.

10:22.347 --> 10:24.331
Your mother's fine.

10:25.367 --> 10:27.108
(Hen scoffs)

10:27.127 --> 10:29.702
He was useless.

10:29.796 --> 10:32.130
A complete waste
of a doctor's coat.

10:32.281 --> 10:34.966
Which is why I never go.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.012
(sirens wailing)

10:40.866 --> 10:43.457
Uh... Yeah.

10:43.551 --> 10:46.219
What do you think?
That's better, right?

10:46.313 --> 10:49.222
I think it looks
exactly the same?

10:49.374 --> 10:52.041
I just want everything
to be perfect.

10:52.135 --> 10:53.226
It's been over a year.

10:53.378 --> 10:54.544
It's gonna be awesome.

10:54.562 --> 10:56.713
-(knock on door)
-CHRISTOPHER: Coming!

10:56.731 --> 10:58.531
Okay.

11:02.145 --> 11:05.121
-Carla!
-(laughing)

11:06.241 --> 11:07.982
Hey!

11:08.001 --> 11:09.984
-Hey...
-Hey!

11:10.078 --> 11:11.744
(laughs):
Hey.

11:11.897 --> 11:13.897
-Oh, I missed my boys.
-Oh...

11:13.990 --> 11:15.748
Oh, I missed you.

11:15.901 --> 11:17.175
-I missed you.
-Yeah?

11:17.402 --> 11:19.752
-Oh. (laughs)
-(Eddie laughs)

11:19.905 --> 11:21.404
(laughter)

11:21.497 --> 11:23.682
I'm sure your teacher
was thrilled.

11:23.833 --> 11:24.924
(laughter)

11:25.076 --> 11:26.592
-Oh, no, no, let me get those.
-Oh, please.

11:26.745 --> 11:30.004
You prepared a lovely meal.
I can help Eddie clean up.

11:30.023 --> 11:32.339
You can't go in the kitchen.

11:32.359 --> 11:34.175
-Oh.
-ANA: Oh, that's right.

11:34.269 --> 11:35.268
Mm-hmm.

11:35.362 --> 11:37.437
We have some business
to take care of.

11:37.589 --> 11:40.940
-We do, don't we?
-Okay. (chuckles)

11:41.092 --> 11:44.444
It is so good to have you back.
We missed you.

11:44.596 --> 11:46.520
(chuckles)

11:46.614 --> 11:49.708
-I'm sorry about your father.
-Me, too.

11:49.935 --> 11:53.378
I'm just grateful I was able
to spend that time with him.

11:53.529 --> 11:55.196
-Mm.
-Still...

11:55.215 --> 11:57.623
I know I left you in the lurch,
and I'm sorry for that.

11:57.776 --> 11:58.699
Oh, no, no, no.

11:58.793 --> 12:00.385
You were where
you were supposed to be.

12:00.536 --> 12:02.554
I'm glad you had that time, too.

12:02.781 --> 12:04.038
Mm.

12:04.132 --> 12:05.223
Christopher seems good.

12:05.450 --> 12:07.283
I know you were worried
about him.

12:07.376 --> 12:09.376
-Yeah, he's doing a lot better.
-Mm.

12:09.396 --> 12:11.304
Almost back to his old
happy self.

12:11.456 --> 12:13.547
And he loves having Ana around.

12:13.567 --> 12:15.216
What about Dad?

12:15.235 --> 12:17.627
How does he feel about
the young Ms. Flores?

12:17.720 --> 12:19.571
(laughs)
It's nice.

12:19.798 --> 12:21.814
-(Carla laughs)
-It's, uh...

12:21.908 --> 12:24.859
-easy being with her.
-Ana is lovely.

12:24.911 --> 12:26.486
And I'm glad that you're
finally moving on.

12:26.580 --> 12:30.749
But just be sure that you're
following your heart,

12:30.900 --> 12:32.250
not Christopher's, okay?

12:32.477 --> 12:33.977

12:33.995 --> 12:36.403
BOTH:
Surprise!

12:36.498 --> 12:38.314
CHRISTOPHER:
Happy birthday, Carla.

12:38.333 --> 12:41.000
But my birthday's in March.

12:41.094 --> 12:42.151
And we missed it twice.

12:42.245 --> 12:44.078
You got me two cakes.
(laughs)

12:44.097 --> 12:45.412
Light the candles, Dad.

12:45.507 --> 12:47.673
Okay, this is a disturbing
number of candles.

12:47.768 --> 12:49.492
-(laughter)
-Thank goodness

12:49.511 --> 12:51.494
there's a firefighter
in the house.

12:51.513 --> 12:54.105
(laughter)

12:54.332 --> 12:55.498

13:06.602 --> 13:09.937
That's the third cup you've had
in the last hour.

13:09.956 --> 13:13.516
Not that I'm counting.
More of a guestimate.

13:13.535 --> 13:15.442
I didn't know
it was humanly possible

13:15.462 --> 13:16.702
to feel this tired.

13:16.855 --> 13:19.130
So Jee's still not sleeping
through the night?

13:19.282 --> 13:20.948
No, that would mean
she would have to

13:20.967 --> 13:23.042
stop crying long enough
to actually sleep.

13:23.194 --> 13:25.786
The doctor says that it's colic,

13:25.806 --> 13:28.122
but I don't know.

13:28.216 --> 13:32.393
It's... it's the way she cries.

13:33.705 --> 13:36.205

nothing calms her.

13:36.299 --> 13:37.540
Well, what about you?

to the hospital.

18:06.402 --> 18:07.326

place for a sick child.

19:05.979 --> 19:07.294
and I don't know what to think.

19:07.388 --> 19:09.814
Except maybe he's
drinking again.

19:10.041 --> 19:12.041
Well, have you talked
to him, Athena?

19:12.059 --> 19:13.893
Oh, not yet.

19:14.045 --> 19:15.227
I'm not even sure what to say.

19:15.380 --> 19:18.230
Every question sounds
like an accusation.

19:18.383 --> 19:21.642
I can see that you're worried,
but I got to say

19:21.661 --> 19:23.977
none of this sounds
like the Bobby I know.

19:24.071 --> 19:27.239
The problem is, there's a Bobby
I never met.

19:27.333 --> 19:31.002
The one who lost everything
because he lost control.

19:31.153 --> 19:32.912
Yeah, but he isn't
that man anymore.

19:33.064 --> 19:34.672
He thinks he could be.

19:34.823 --> 19:36.457
A few months back,
the drunk driver

19:36.567 --> 19:38.567
who caused the pileup
on the 710--

19:38.661 --> 19:40.494
Bobby told me there was
only one difference

19:40.546 --> 19:43.723
between the two of them:
one bad day.

19:45.185 --> 19:48.352
What if he's had
that one bad day?

19:49.189 --> 19:51.439
MICHAEL:
Hmm.

19:52.883 --> 19:54.007
<i> CHARLIE:</i>
<i> You're lucky.</i>

19:54.101 --> 19:55.193
My mom's a terrible cook,

19:55.344 --> 19:56.527
but your dad's great.

19:56.754 --> 19:58.196

19:58.423 --> 19:59.939

20:02.685 --> 20:04.351
-Oh, shoot.
-No worries.

20:04.445 --> 20:05.703
I got it.

20:05.930 --> 20:09.465
Uh, where does your mom keep
the paper towels?

20:09.525 --> 20:10.691
Upper cabinet.

20:10.785 --> 20:12.859
<i> CARLA: Charlie,</i>
<i> what school do you go to?</i>

20:12.879 --> 20:14.286
I don't go to school.

20:14.439 --> 20:16.272
Because I'm sick.
We move around a lot.

20:16.365 --> 20:17.864
I'm not supposed to go out,

20:17.959 --> 20:19.291
except for doctors'
appointments.

20:19.444 --> 20:21.535
<i> CHRISTOPHER:</i>
<i> What kind of doctors?</i>

20:21.554 --> 20:22.611
I don't know, all kinds.

20:22.630 --> 20:24.280
We're always going
to see a new one.

20:24.298 --> 20:26.707
Whew. Sounds expensive.

20:26.726 --> 20:28.041
What's your mom do for work?

20:28.061 --> 20:30.561
She always says her job is
to take care of me.

20:30.713 --> 20:32.471
We're lucky because
we get donations

20:32.565 --> 20:33.789
from a Fund Me page.

20:33.882 --> 20:34.899
Ah.

20:35.050 --> 20:36.901
-I'm home.
-Hey.

20:37.052 --> 20:38.477
Look who's back.

20:38.629 --> 20:40.479
-And all patched up.
-Hi, Mom.

20:40.631 --> 20:41.814
You cooked for him.

20:41.966 --> 20:44.633
Charlie has a very
sensitive stomach.

20:44.652 --> 20:46.727
Figured you'd be a little wobbly
when you got back.

20:46.746 --> 20:48.913
-Just wanted to make it
easier for you.
-Don't worry, Mom,

20:49.064 --> 20:50.230
I don't feel sick or anything.

20:50.250 --> 20:52.083
-That's great, sweetheart.
-Oh,

20:52.234 --> 20:53.400
this is my new friend

20:59.500 --> 21:00.649
He's super cool.

21:00.668 --> 21:02.260
Do you think we could
hang out sometime?

21:02.428 --> 21:03.910
(Sheila sighs)

21:03.930 --> 21:05.596
We'll have to see.

21:09.769 --> 21:14.939
No, Mom, I'm not nagging you,
I'm-I'm just checking on you.

21:15.090 --> 21:16.590
Okay, great.

21:16.609 --> 21:19.926
-Well, maybe you should...
-(phone beeps)

21:19.946 --> 21:22.354
And she hung up on me.

21:22.448 --> 21:24.949
(laughs):
Take it as a positive sign.

21:25.176 --> 21:26.701
Must mean she's feeling better.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.436
So how are you doing?

21:29.455 --> 21:31.372
Fine.

21:33.367 --> 21:34.867
I'm still a little freaked out
not knowing

21:34.961 --> 21:36.519
what's wrong with my mom.

21:36.537 --> 21:38.203
Well, maybe you should
take her to see a specialist.

21:38.356 --> 21:40.447
I would, but I need
to have some idea

21:40.541 --> 21:41.966
of what's wrong first.

21:42.193 --> 21:44.710
And that doctor was no help.

21:44.862 --> 21:46.804
He practically dismissed us.

21:47.031 --> 21:49.865
Eh, you know how crazy
it can get in the ER.

21:50.476 --> 21:53.369
Not that I'm not defending him,
I'm just saying.

21:53.387 --> 21:56.814
He barely acknowledged
we were in the room, Chim.

21:57.041 --> 22:00.225
And when I asked questions,
he acted as if I offended him.

22:00.320 --> 22:02.636
Like, "How dare you?"

22:02.655 --> 22:06.807
I mean, I hate to think it,
but maybe our experience

22:06.901 --> 22:11.537
would have been different
if he had looked more like us.

22:13.482 --> 22:16.725
I was a 12-year-old Korean boy
translating to the doctor

22:16.819 --> 22:18.002
on behalf of my sick mother.

22:18.153 --> 22:20.171
Makes you wonder how bad it is

22:20.398 --> 22:22.247
for a patient
who doesn't have anyone,

22:22.342 --> 22:24.175
no one to advocate for them.

22:24.344 --> 22:26.919
That's why people like you
and me can't put

22:27.071 --> 22:28.637
all our trust in doctors.

22:29.832 --> 22:31.515
Because they don't trust us.

22:31.667 --> 22:33.834
To know how we're feeling,

22:33.853 --> 22:37.355
to-to know
when something's wrong.

22:37.506 --> 22:41.025
I know something's wrong, Chim.

22:42.587 --> 22:44.587
What you need
are some brilliant medical minds

22:44.605 --> 22:46.179
to bounce ideas off of.

22:46.199 --> 22:48.699
You know any of those?

Patient has a history

23:13.134 --> 23:14.133
of high blood pressure
and smoking.

23:14.227 --> 23:15.300
I haven't had a cigarette

23:15.453 --> 23:17.302

BP's normal,
heart rate's a little elevated,

23:21.383 --> 23:23.976
-but that could be stress.
-Okay, so why would
she be stressed?

23:24.128 --> 23:27.129
Maybe because you keep
referring to me as "she."

23:27.815 --> 23:30.149
What about kidney failure?
Could explain the back pain.

23:30.243 --> 23:33.077
It would've shown up in the
blood labs from the hospital.

23:33.228 --> 23:35.079
One of the few tests
they did take.

23:35.306 --> 23:38.490
Could be an inner ear problem,
like, uh, Ménière's disease.

23:38.643 --> 23:41.067
Would explain the loss
of balance and dizziness.

24:36.701 --> 24:37.883
Her heart is racing.

24:38.035 --> 24:43.038
Picking up a pulsating
sensation around her navel.

24:43.131 --> 24:45.131
It's definitely cardiac.

You've been doing great.

You know what? I have not had
a minute to myself all day.

26:20.395 --> 26:23.488
So, you good with her
while I hop in the shower?

of having surgery
at this hospital,

Uh, yes, and I have

She's experiencing dizziness,
back pain,

27:02.363 --> 27:03.862
and orthostatic hypotension.

27:03.956 --> 27:06.348
Could be looking
at abdominal aortic aneurysm.

27:06.367 --> 27:09.017
We need an electrocardiogram
to verify, stat.

27:09.111 --> 27:11.353
-Uh...
-LUIS: Hello?

27:11.446 --> 27:14.356
-You heard her.
-Uh, of course.

27:14.375 --> 27:16.508
I'll get someone right away.

27:21.031 --> 27:23.699
Echo and EKG show
severe deterioration

27:23.792 --> 27:25.142
of the abdominal aorta.

27:25.293 --> 27:29.221
Imaging shows that a rupture
was imminent.

27:29.373 --> 27:31.482
They're prepping her
for surgery now.

27:31.667 --> 27:33.225
So, she's okay?

27:33.377 --> 27:35.544
They should be able
to graft the artery, yeah.

27:35.604 --> 27:38.155
The surgical team will be by
in a few minutes,

27:38.306 --> 27:40.157
go over the procedure with you,

27:40.308 --> 27:42.234
answer any questions
you may have.

27:42.328 --> 27:46.497
Hopefully more thoroughly
than you were the other day.

27:47.408 --> 27:50.501
(laughs softly):
I beg your pardon?

27:51.896 --> 27:55.564
She could have died
if I hadn't brought her back in.

27:55.582 --> 27:58.250
You sent us home
with-with no explanation,

27:58.344 --> 28:02.328
no diagnosis
and barely any treatment.

28:03.165 --> 28:06.575
Look, I am sorry
that I missed it.

28:06.668 --> 28:09.428
But the important thing
is that we caught it in time...

28:10.264 --> 28:12.189
...and your mother
is gonna be fine.

28:12.340 --> 28:14.266
"We"?

28:14.360 --> 28:16.418
You know, when I'm out
in the field on a call,

28:16.511 --> 28:19.771
I have a split second
to diagnose a patient,

28:19.924 --> 28:20.939
if I'm lucky.

28:21.091 --> 28:23.608
I-I can't run blood,

28:23.761 --> 28:26.870
do an X-ray or-or order an echo.

28:27.022 --> 28:28.764
All I have is what I know,

28:28.782 --> 28:33.359
and my ability to listen
to what the patient is saying.

28:33.379 --> 28:35.862
Even with every tool
a-at your disposal,

28:35.956 --> 28:37.456
you still got it wrong.

28:37.550 --> 28:40.867
Okay, what-what would you
have had me do differently?

28:40.886 --> 28:46.782
Believe them when they tell you
that something is wrong.

28:46.875 --> 28:48.726
Start there.

I have some old ones
I don't play anymore.

29:09.790 --> 29:12.157
You know what, I'm not sure.
I didn't see a television

29:12.309 --> 29:13.809
when I was there.

29:13.827 --> 29:15.994
-You know, let's just stick
to books and toys.
-No TV?

29:16.088 --> 29:17.829
-He really does need our help.
-(Carla chuckles)

29:17.965 --> 29:20.148
Just remember that help
doesn't always come

29:20.167 --> 29:21.741
in the form of screen time.

29:21.761 --> 29:23.243
-EDDIE: Uh-huh.
-(laughs)

29:23.337 --> 29:27.431
Wow, someone's feeling generous.

29:27.658 --> 29:28.840
Hey, Eddie.

29:28.934 --> 29:32.144
-Can I talk to you for a second?
-Yeah.

29:33.680 --> 29:36.014
Now, don't let him give away
the whole house while I'm gone.

29:36.166 --> 29:38.358
CARLA (laughs):
Okay.

29:39.853 --> 29:42.428
-What's going on?
-I was thinking about
what you said,

29:42.448 --> 29:44.114
how that family
supports themselves

29:44.266 --> 29:48.118
through their Fund Me page,
so I started looking around...

29:48.270 --> 29:50.012
You went snooping?

29:50.030 --> 29:51.863
I was trying to make a donation.

29:51.957 --> 29:55.108
Maybe circulate it
on the faculty newsletter.

29:55.127 --> 29:58.854
But I think there's
something wrong with this woman.

29:58.872 --> 30:00.113
(laughs softly)
That feels like a leap.

30:00.132 --> 30:01.373
You haven't even met her.

30:01.525 --> 30:06.028
No, but I found
some weird stuff online.

30:06.121 --> 30:08.305
I think she lied to you.

30:09.624 --> 30:11.291
About what?

30:11.385 --> 30:12.868
<i> CARLA:</i>
<i> That's a lot of Fund Me pages.</i>

30:12.961 --> 30:17.222
There's Sheila
and Charlie Burns in El Paso,

30:17.374 --> 30:20.392
Sheila and Charlie Young
in Phoenix,

30:20.544 --> 30:25.489
and Sheila and Charlie Watts
of Santa Fe.

30:27.326 --> 30:29.734
It's him, the same kid
every time,

30:29.829 --> 30:33.238
just with different last names
and different cities.

30:33.390 --> 30:35.332
Charlie did say
they moved around a lot.

30:35.559 --> 30:38.318
That would explain the different
accounts and different cities,

30:38.337 --> 30:40.078
but not the different names.

30:40.230 --> 30:41.338
What did his mom say
his illness was?

30:41.565 --> 30:44.875
(laughs softly)
She didn't. Not really.

30:45.027 --> 30:46.159
Said it was autoimmune.

30:46.253 --> 30:49.346
Well, that's awfully general.

30:49.497 --> 30:52.182
Charlie did say he goes
to a lot of different doctors.

30:52.292 --> 30:53.684
Could be doctor shopping.

30:53.835 --> 30:56.836
Which is what you do
when you're not really sick,

30:56.856 --> 31:01.024
you're just looking for
a doctor to say that you are.

31:01.176 --> 31:02.508
You think she's lying?

31:02.528 --> 31:05.028
Well, we wouldn't be
the only ones.

31:06.365 --> 31:08.014
Most of the Fund Me pages
were shut down,

31:08.033 --> 31:10.701
but the comments are still up.

31:10.928 --> 31:14.187
"This woman is a fraud
and a scammer.

31:14.206 --> 31:15.614
Do not trust her."

31:15.766 --> 31:18.767
"She's a con artist looking
for money and attention."

31:18.785 --> 31:22.588
-Oh, God.
-CARLA: What?

31:23.957 --> 31:26.049
"I think she's making
her kid sick."

31:39.047 --> 31:41.714
Oh, you didn't have
to do dishes.

31:41.734 --> 31:42.974
You cooked.

31:43.127 --> 31:44.292
Well, that's okay.

31:44.311 --> 31:46.294
What do you say,
you want to watch a movie?

31:46.429 --> 31:49.981
May is out
and Harry's at Michael's.

31:50.134 --> 31:52.075
We could have a date night in.

31:52.227 --> 31:53.652
Um, rain check?

31:53.746 --> 31:56.304
I just had a really long day,
I think I got to crash.

31:56.323 --> 32:00.250
Hmm. Is everything okay?

32:00.402 --> 32:03.569
I mean, if something's
bothering you,

32:03.664 --> 32:05.923
if something's on your mind,
you know you can talk to me.

32:06.150 --> 32:07.925
Everything is fine.

32:08.152 --> 32:11.836
-Nothing to talk about.
-It doesn't feel fine.

32:11.989 --> 32:13.155
I'm worried about you.

32:13.248 --> 32:14.932
-Athena, I'm...
-I know you have

32:15.159 --> 32:16.934
your meetings,
and I'm glad you have people

32:17.161 --> 32:19.286
that you can talk to.

32:19.288 --> 32:21.421
-But you can talk to me, too.
-Yeah, I know,

32:21.515 --> 32:25.400
it's-- the meetings...
not the same.

32:26.928 --> 32:28.594
Yeah, I know.

32:28.614 --> 32:31.173
I can never really understand
that part of your life,

32:31.266 --> 32:34.509
but I'd like to try.

32:34.528 --> 32:36.678
Maybe I can go with you
to your meeting?

32:36.697 --> 32:38.789
You have one tomorrow, right?

32:38.940 --> 32:41.016
That is very sweet of you,
but no.

32:41.109 --> 32:46.129
I-I don't have one tomorrow,
but you could come on Saturday.

32:47.299 --> 32:48.799
Great.

32:48.950 --> 32:51.426
Good, okay. Good night.

32:55.123 --> 32:57.307
(Athena exhales)

33:00.537 --> 33:03.146
HEN:
I'm fine, Karen.
You, you stay there.

33:03.298 --> 33:05.565
I'll call you
when I have an update.

33:08.545 --> 33:10.362
You're still here?

33:12.232 --> 33:14.474
You didn't, you didn't have to.

33:14.568 --> 33:16.660
It's your mom.

33:19.814 --> 33:21.981
Thank you.

33:22.001 --> 33:24.126
-For everything.
-(door opens)

33:25.062 --> 33:27.295
SYDNEY:
Hen.

33:29.174 --> 33:31.341
SURGEON:
Ms. Wilson?

33:31.493 --> 33:33.084
Good news.

33:33.237 --> 33:35.387
(laughs softly)

33:46.099 --> 33:49.675
Hey, Ma. How you feeling?

33:49.695 --> 33:51.528
A little sore...

33:53.257 --> 33:55.181
...but a lot grateful.

33:55.200 --> 33:57.926
The surgeon did a good job.

33:57.944 --> 34:00.871
You're gonna make
a full recovery, Ma.

34:01.022 --> 34:02.597
I'm glad to hear that.

34:02.616 --> 34:07.461
But it's not the doctor
I'm grateful for.

34:09.197 --> 34:11.673
You saved my life.

34:13.385 --> 34:14.867
(laughs softly)

34:14.961 --> 34:19.130
Well, the truth is,
I got used to having you around.

34:19.224 --> 34:23.042
So I'm not ready
to let you go just yet.

34:23.954 --> 34:26.546
I won't be around forever,
Henrietta.

34:26.640 --> 34:28.690
-Ma...
-I won't.

34:31.128 --> 34:33.445
So let me say this.

34:37.076 --> 34:40.118
I am so proud of you.

34:41.563 --> 34:47.233
Henrietta, you... working
so hard and going to school,

34:47.252 --> 34:49.544
taking care of your family.

34:51.315 --> 34:54.132
I know it's a struggle.

34:56.095 --> 34:58.470
But it is worth it.

35:00.099 --> 35:02.099
Because people like me?

35:03.918 --> 35:06.520
We need doctors like you.

35:09.499 --> 35:12.943
So, promise me...

35:13.779 --> 35:16.947
...no matter how hard it gets,

35:17.098 --> 35:19.991
you won't give up.

35:22.529 --> 35:24.663
You promise?

35:29.795 --> 35:32.003
I promise.

35:40.622 --> 35:43.548
Guess B shift's
still out on a call.

35:43.700 --> 35:45.200
BUCK:
Damn.

35:45.293 --> 35:46.885
-You're early.
-EDDIE: Couldn't sleep.

35:47.037 --> 35:49.295
You remember the mom
the other day? Sheila?

35:49.389 --> 35:51.222
-With the sick kid?
-BOTH: Yeah.

35:51.375 --> 35:52.983
He's not sick. Not really.

35:53.210 --> 35:55.485
She's making him sick.
Probably for years.

35:55.712 --> 35:57.821
Munchausen by proxy?
That's a big accusation, Eddie.

35:57.972 --> 36:00.157
EDDIE:
I tracked down some people
that knew them before.

36:00.350 --> 36:01.733
All signs point to it.

36:01.827 --> 36:03.976
The nonspecific
autoimmune disease,

36:03.996 --> 36:05.553
the revolving door of doctors.

36:05.572 --> 36:09.073
He's frail, he's weak,
he's always throwing up.

36:09.168 --> 36:10.500
She's poisoning him.

36:10.727 --> 36:13.545
Poisoning him? W-With what?

36:16.842 --> 36:19.250
Eye drops.
I saw them in the kitchen.

36:19.344 --> 36:20.677
CHIMNEY:
Eye drops. Tetrahydrozoline

36:20.828 --> 36:23.254
could cause the symptoms
that you're talking about.

36:23.348 --> 36:24.664
It can be lethal
if it's ingested,

36:24.758 --> 36:26.741
doesn't show up
on a standard toxicology test.

36:26.834 --> 36:29.093
-You have to know to look
for it to find it.
-She's dosing him.

36:29.246 --> 36:32.022
Not enough to kill him
but enough to keep him sick.

36:32.173 --> 36:33.598
I called social services.

36:33.750 --> 36:35.250
They're coming here
to take a report.

36:35.268 --> 36:36.434
Why-why would she do that?

36:36.586 --> 36:38.195
Well, sometimes
it's to gain sympathy.

36:38.422 --> 36:40.346
Oh, or maybe to make a profit.

36:40.365 --> 36:42.848
I found multiple Fund Me pages.

36:42.943 --> 36:44.684
She's conning people
out of their money.

36:44.703 --> 36:46.995
(phone vibrating, ringing)

36:49.357 --> 36:51.933
-Hello?
<i> -CHARLIE: Eddie?</i>

36:52.026 --> 36:54.211
Charlie? You okay?

36:54.362 --> 36:57.380
I think I did a bad thing.

36:57.532 --> 36:59.633
(retching)

37:10.545 --> 37:11.953
(laughs): Athena, come on.
You-you followed him?

37:11.972 --> 37:13.288
Not my finest hour,

37:13.306 --> 37:15.715
but I needed to know
where he was going.

37:15.734 --> 37:16.900
Okay, and?

37:17.051 --> 37:18.384
He went to a meeting.

37:18.403 --> 37:20.070
<i> Now, that's a great thing.</i>
<i> Right?</i>

37:20.297 --> 37:22.297
Except he lied to me about it.

37:22.315 --> 37:25.224
<i> So you still think</i>
<i> that he's hiding something.</i>

37:25.318 --> 37:27.327
(sighs)

37:28.822 --> 37:31.414
Maybe not a what.

37:32.400 --> 37:33.625
Maybe a who.

37:33.810 --> 37:35.335
(speaks indistinctly)

37:36.904 --> 37:39.422
Got to go. Talk later.

37:40.425 --> 37:42.241
(siren wailing)

37:42.335 --> 37:45.253
(tires screeching)

37:46.748 --> 37:48.581
Buckley, you get promoted to
captain when I wasn't looking?

37:48.600 --> 37:51.175
-Only vehicle available.
-Diaz, you called this in?

37:51.328 --> 37:53.311
Yeah. Possible O.D.

37:55.499 --> 37:57.348
She's over here.
I-I don't think she's breathing.

37:57.501 --> 37:59.943
EDDIE:
We're here now, we got her.

38:00.170 --> 38:01.611
MEHTA:
Do we know what she took?

38:01.763 --> 38:03.505
BUCK:
Yeah, uh, Eddie thinks
it's tetrahydrozoline poisoning.

38:03.523 --> 38:05.657
Uh, eye drops.

38:07.101 --> 38:08.785
She always puts drops
in my food.

38:09.012 --> 38:10.770
She thinks I don't see her,
but I do.

38:10.789 --> 38:13.123
I just wanted to see what would
happen if I gave them to her.

38:13.274 --> 38:15.625
-I-I'm sorry.
-Oh, no, that's okay,
that's okay.

38:15.777 --> 38:17.127
You didn't mean to hurt her.

38:17.278 --> 38:19.037
BUCK:
Yeah, the kid's
gonna need treatment, too.

38:19.131 --> 38:22.299
Same kind of poisoning,
just smaller doses.

38:23.193 --> 38:24.759
But for a really long time.

38:26.379 --> 38:28.120
<i> MADDIE:</i>
<i>So she was hurting her own kid?</i>

38:28.214 --> 38:30.381
<i> CHIMNEY (over phone):</i>
<i> Yeah, for money or attention</i>

38:30.534 --> 38:32.458
<i> or something</i>
<i>that doesn't really even matter.</i>

38:32.552 --> 38:34.719
My God. That's terrible.

38:34.871 --> 38:36.813
You know, I never thought
I'd say this, but I'm glad

38:36.964 --> 38:38.706
she fell through
that balcony floor.

38:38.800 --> 38:41.376
At least that kid
will be safe, far away from her.

38:41.394 --> 38:44.654
Yeah. Sounds like
he's better off without her.

38:44.881 --> 38:47.991
<i> Yeah, I guess some people</i>
<i>just aren't meant to be parents.</i>

38:50.662 --> 38:53.555
<i> Anyway, kind of made me</i>
<i> want to hear your voice,</i>

38:53.573 --> 38:55.481
tell you guys
how much I love you.

38:55.575 --> 38:56.833
<i> You're sweet.</i>

38:56.984 --> 38:59.318
How are things there?
I don't hear Jee-Yun crying.

38:59.338 --> 39:00.986
<i> That seems like a good sign.</i>

39:01.081 --> 39:03.489
She's finally asleep.

39:03.508 --> 39:05.675
<i> Well, that's a relief.</i>
<i>Hey, listen, Hen just showed up,</i>

39:05.902 --> 39:07.177
<i> and I want to hear</i>
<i> about her mom.</i>

39:07.328 --> 39:09.587
<i> Can I call you later?</i>

39:09.681 --> 39:10.996
Yeah.

39:11.091 --> 39:14.351
Yeah, we're good here.
There's nothing to worry about.

39:18.748 --> 39:20.932
You followed me to a meeting?

39:21.084 --> 39:22.341
You lied to me.

39:22.361 --> 39:23.843
I couldn't understand why,
and then I saw her.

39:23.862 --> 39:27.939
That's Rachel Hawkerson, the
drunk driver from the pileup.

39:28.091 --> 39:29.273
Are you sponsoring her?

39:29.368 --> 39:33.686
Look, I am trying to help her.

39:33.780 --> 39:35.446
She's having a hard time
finding somebody to talk to

39:35.599 --> 39:37.707
who can actually relate
to what she went through.

39:37.859 --> 39:40.377
The other night, when you came
home smelling like bourbon?

39:40.604 --> 39:41.769
That was Rachel's.

39:41.863 --> 39:43.271
She fell off the wagon
and called me,

39:43.289 --> 39:44.606
she was still drinking
when I got there,

39:44.624 --> 39:45.715
and the bottle spilled on me

39:45.867 --> 39:47.366
when I tried to take it away
from her.

39:47.386 --> 39:49.386
You gonna have to help me out
here, Bobby.

39:50.447 --> 39:52.204
Why didn't you just
tell me what was going on?

39:52.224 --> 39:53.965
Because it's not
my story to tell.

39:54.117 --> 39:55.783
I didn't want to violate
her confidentiality.

39:55.877 --> 39:57.118
Oh, you can tell me
what you're doing

39:57.137 --> 39:58.620
without telling me who.

39:58.638 --> 40:01.305
All the sneaking around,
leaving me in the dark.

40:01.400 --> 40:03.625
Why shut me out? I'm your wife.

40:03.643 --> 40:06.403
Yeah. It's hard when your spouse
keeps things from you.

40:06.554 --> 40:08.029
Trust me, I know.

40:08.723 --> 40:09.739
Wait.

40:09.908 --> 40:11.908
Is this supposed to be
some kind of punishment?

40:12.135 --> 40:14.135
You mean you're keeping
this secret on purpose

40:14.154 --> 40:17.563
-to get back at me?
-No!

40:17.582 --> 40:20.308
I don't know.

40:20.326 --> 40:22.401
I decided to help somebody
and I didn't think

40:22.421 --> 40:24.328
I needed to tell you about it.

40:24.481 --> 40:26.756
You don't let me in
on half the decisions you make.

40:26.908 --> 40:27.832
Like what?

40:29.002 --> 40:31.502
You decided to go back to work
without talking to me about it,

40:31.596 --> 40:33.504
just like you stopped
seeing Dr. Sanford

40:33.598 --> 40:36.081
without mentioning it to me,
and then it turns out

40:36.101 --> 40:37.842
you were offered retirement
and you dismiss it,

40:37.969 --> 40:39.585
and I'm kept completely
in the dark about it.

40:39.604 --> 40:42.163
I didn't think I needed
to ask you for your permission.

40:42.182 --> 40:44.499
You don't.
This is about me

40:44.517 --> 40:47.001
not even being a factor
or a consideration.

40:47.020 --> 40:48.352
You don't--
It doesn't cross your mind

40:48.447 --> 40:50.280
to include me
in the conversation

40:50.431 --> 40:53.098
or wonder what I might think.

40:53.118 --> 40:54.692
We're supposed to be partners,

40:54.844 --> 40:58.288
but the truth is, you don't want
one, at work or in your life.

40:58.481 --> 41:00.439
I'm used to doing things
on my own. That's who I am,

41:00.533 --> 41:02.366
and you knew that
when you married me.

41:02.502 --> 41:04.202
Well, I thought that,
eventually, you would start

41:04.354 --> 41:06.354
to trust me more,
but now I'm starting to think

41:06.372 --> 41:08.039
that you're just gonna
always keep this wall up

41:08.191 --> 41:10.467
and I'm always gonna feel
like an outsider looking in.

41:10.618 --> 41:12.469
Well, maybe you wouldn't feel
like an outsider if you talked

41:12.620 --> 41:16.139
to me instead of playing
this tit-for-tat game.

41:16.290 --> 41:18.475
Marriage isn't supposed
to work like that.

41:18.626 --> 41:20.384
Well, who said
this marriage is working?

41:21.629 --> 41:25.023
We're not partners
because that's how you want it.

41:29.395 --> 41:31.988
-(indistinct radio chatter)
-What about my mom?

41:32.139 --> 41:34.473
-Will I see her at the hospital?
-EDDIE: She's a little
more sick.

41:34.493 --> 41:35.825
She's got to go
to a different hospital.

41:36.052 --> 41:37.051
This is your ride.

41:37.144 --> 41:38.143
SHEILA:
My-my baby!

41:38.163 --> 41:40.997
Where's my baby?

41:41.148 --> 41:43.057
(muffled):
Where's my baby...

41:43.150 --> 41:44.575
(engine starts)

41:44.669 --> 41:46.336
Should've gotten here sooner.

41:46.563 --> 41:48.487
That kid is just lucky
he met you.

41:48.507 --> 41:51.323
MEHTA:
Diaz, you want to ride
with the kid to the hospital?

41:51.343 --> 41:54.093
-Yeah. That'd be gr...
-(gunshot)

42:21.598 --> 42:23.748
-(people screaming)
-MEHTA: Get down!

42:26.527 --> 42:27.860
-(radio crackles)
-Shots fired.

42:27.879 --> 42:29.361
Shots fired.
A firefighter is down.

42:29.381 --> 42:31.956
I repeat, firefighter is down!

42:32.050 --> 42:35.426
Shots fired. Shots fired.
