14:09.716 --> 14:12.650
- I'm really glad this was just
a 10-point question.

14:14.337 --> 14:18.923
I believe option c, 342.

14:22.128 --> 14:24.596
- That is incorrect, david.

14:24.664 --> 14:29.350
The correct answer is d, 352.

14:29.436 --> 14:31.636
But let's see
how your housemates did.

14:32.272 --> 14:33.471
They were correct.

14:33.523 --> 14:36.057
You earned a total
of 10 points.

14:36.142 --> 14:39.510
This question about slytherin
is worth 10 points.

14:39.579 --> 14:40.945
Who do you want to answer it?

14:41.014 --> 14:43.081
- They're all extremely bright.

14:43.149 --> 14:44.515
- Aww.

14:44.584 --> 14:46.417
- But why don't we do
michelle this time?

14:46.486 --> 14:49.888
- Oh, michelle.
Here's your question.

15:09.976 --> 15:12.226
- I feel pretty confident
in this one.

15:12.312 --> 15:13.745
Frank bryce is the one

15:13.813 --> 15:17.315
who was killed shortly
before his 77th birthday.

15:20.186 --> 15:22.820
- You are absolutely right.

15:22.889 --> 15:24.889
10 points for slytherin.

15:24.941 --> 15:26.157
Well done, michelle.

15:26.225 --> 15:28.393
Let's see
how your housemates did.

15:28.461 --> 15:32.664
You earned a total of 20 points
for that one.

15:32.732 --> 15:36.768
This question about hufflepuff
is worth 30 points.

15:36.836 --> 15:39.370
- Now, I'm less sure
about this one.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.673
I see that luke
is also wearing glasses.

15:42.876 --> 15:45.376
Why don't we go
with the theme of just glasses?

15:46.179 --> 15:47.679
- Luke, okay.

16:07.934 --> 16:11.235
- So I feel like I remember
in this moment he's bragging.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.571
So for me, it's between
oxford and eton.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.506
I'm gonna go with b, eton.

16:18.678 --> 16:20.712
- Luke, you're
absolutely correct.

16:21.648 --> 16:23.915
And you won 30 points
for your team.

16:25.552 --> 16:28.186
So let's see
how your housemates did.

16:28.254 --> 16:30.138
- Yes!

16:30.223 --> 16:32.006
- Another 30 points.

16:32.092 --> 16:35.009
And now once more back
to you, hufflepuff.

16:35.095 --> 16:39.697
This question about slytherin
is worth 30 points.

16:39.766 --> 16:41.666
- I'm trying to think of, like,
the buzzer round

16:41.735 --> 16:43.735
and who was quick
on the buzzer.

16:43.803 --> 16:46.237
- I feel like giulia
was quicker.

16:46.306 --> 16:47.572
- Yeah, maybe we'll go
for giulia

16:47.640 --> 16:50.241
and save the harder one
for ryan.

16:50.310 --> 16:52.026
- And here's the question.

17:13.066 --> 17:15.833
- I'm thinking it's got to be
hagrid because when

17:15.902 --> 17:21.506
he's telling harry everything
about his past, he says, "v--"

17:21.574 --> 17:23.357
and then he says,
"I don't want to say it."

17:23.443 --> 17:26.360
so I'm gonna go
with hagrid, yes.

17:30.450 --> 17:32.717
- I'm afraid that's wrong,
giulia.

17:32.786 --> 17:35.987
The answer is c,
professor mcgonagall.

17:36.039 --> 17:37.488
- Oh, man.

17:37.540 --> 17:39.557
- But let's see
how your housemates did.

17:40.927 --> 17:43.561
You've earned
a total of 30 points.

17:45.715 --> 17:50.101
Now, it's your critical
50-point dueling club question,

17:50.170 --> 17:54.005
which will be posed by famous
alumni from your own houses.

17:54.057 --> 17:56.057
There's only
one hufflepuff player

17:56.142 --> 17:58.709
who hasn't played
this round yet, adriana.

17:59.179 --> 18:03.514
To ask that 50-point question
is hufflepuff's house ghost,

18:03.583 --> 18:04.816
the fat friar.

18:04.884 --> 18:08.686
Please welcome
simon fisher-becker.

18:09.689 --> 18:11.255
- Hello, everyone.
Congratulations,

18:11.324 --> 18:15.593
fellow hufflepuffs,
on making it to the final.

18:34.514 --> 18:36.948
- So tom riddle

18:37.016 --> 18:41.619
woos hepzibah smith
into giving it to him.

18:41.688 --> 18:44.522
So b, hepzibah smith.

18:44.591 --> 18:45.656
- Let's see if you're right.

18:45.725 --> 18:47.358
- The answer is b!

18:47.426 --> 18:48.960
Nice work, hufflepuffs!

18:49.028 --> 18:51.629
<i> You've made your house proud!</i>

18:51.698 --> 18:53.998
Good luck in the rest
of the final.

18:54.067 --> 18:55.299
You can do it.

18:55.368 --> 18:56.868
- Well done, adriana.

18:56.936 --> 19:00.488
Okay, now, let's see
how your housemates did.

19:00.907 --> 19:02.456
- Yeah!

19:02.942 --> 19:08.129
- So you've earned a total
of 100 points there.

19:08.214 --> 19:12.750
Well done, hufflepuff.

19:12.819 --> 19:14.418
Now it's slytherin's chance

19:14.487 --> 19:16.921
to try to answer
a 50-point question.

19:16.990 --> 19:18.923
So hufflepuff,
why did you leave ryan?

19:18.975 --> 19:21.392
- Well, it's easy.
It's courtesy, ladies first.

19:21.460 --> 19:23.694
- I like your style, david.

19:23.763 --> 19:26.430
- If it's true that it's
more fun to play a villain,

19:26.499 --> 19:30.434
then this fine young actor
must've truly enjoyed himself

19:30.503 --> 19:34.138
playing harry's foil,
draco malfoy.

19:34.207 --> 19:37.491
Please welcome tom felton.

19:38.912 --> 19:42.613
- Hello again, everybody.
Congratulations, slytherins.

19:42.665 --> 19:45.482
Making it to the finale
is quite the achievement.

19:45.535 --> 19:46.617
Bravo.

19:46.669 --> 19:48.502
- Yes, bravo.

19:49.389 --> 19:52.323
- Slytherins are
characteristically ambitious.

19:53.193 --> 19:56.994
And no one was more power-
hungry than dolores umbridge.

20:17.550 --> 20:21.652
- My favorite character
is professor dolores umbridge.

20:21.721 --> 20:23.287
I'm gonna go with d,

20:23.356 --> 20:25.689
head of the department
of magical law enforcement.

20:25.742 --> 20:27.658
- Let's see if you're correct.

20:30.496 --> 20:31.996
- The answer...

20:32.065 --> 20:33.030
Is d.

20:33.099 --> 20:34.398
- Yes!

20:34.467 --> 20:38.669
- 50 points for slytherin.
Now keep it going.

20:38.738 --> 20:41.706
The tournament trophy
is within your grasp.

20:41.774 --> 20:43.641
- Let's see how
your housemates did.

20:44.143 --> 20:47.061
You also have earned
a total of 100 points.

20:47.146 --> 20:50.181
My goodness me,
this is a real head-to-head.

20:50.650 --> 20:52.817
Luke youngblood,

20:52.885 --> 20:55.119
so tell us,
where do our points stand?

20:55.188 --> 20:57.405
- Oh, well, it's
a very tense game, isn't it?

20:57.490 --> 20:58.623
- It certainly is.

20:58.691 --> 21:01.692
- Slytherin are currently
at 150

21:01.761 --> 21:08.165
and just narrowly in the lead
is hufflepuff with 170 points!

21:12.338 --> 21:15.456
- Everybody, hold on
to your hippogriffs,

21:15.541 --> 21:17.408
because when we come back,

21:17.477 --> 21:19.093
there might be an actual actor

21:19.178 --> 21:21.245
from
"the sorcerer's stone" film

21:21.314 --> 21:23.447
standing right there.

21:23.516 --> 21:26.150
I don't think you want
to miss that, now do you?

It's a nail-biting competition
with slytherin on 150 points

21:47.340 --> 21:51.742
and hufflepuff just in the lead
with 170 points.

21:51.811 --> 21:53.411
And we're on to round three,

the department
of magical games.

21:56.816 --> 21:58.316
- Whoo!

22:01.337 --> 22:03.921
- We're going to reveal
some magical charms

22:03.990 --> 22:05.790

and you're going to take turns

22:10.980 --> 22:15.599
Now, each question is worth

22:15.668 --> 22:17.935
if the other team
gets a question wrong,

22:18.004 --> 22:22.506
you now have the opportunity
to steal and win yourselves

22:22.575 --> 22:23.708
30 points.

22:23.776 --> 22:25.209
Each game in this round

22:25.278 --> 22:27.445
is inspired by tonight's theme,

22:27.513 --> 22:31.415
the story that started it all,
"the sorcerer's stone."

22:32.685 --> 22:34.618
- whoo!

22:36.289 --> 22:37.838
- Hufflepuff,
you're in the lead,

22:37.924 --> 22:39.290
so you get to play first.

22:39.359 --> 22:41.659
Which game would you like
to start off with?

22:41.728 --> 22:45.663
- Homenum revelio
sounds interesting.

22:45.732 --> 22:47.264
- Homenum revelio.

22:47.333 --> 22:50.384
- The homenum revelio charm
can be used

22:50.470 --> 22:52.636
to reveal a human presence

22:52.688 --> 22:55.890
in the vicinity
of the person who casts it.

22:55.975 --> 22:57.358
So in this game,

22:57.443 --> 23:01.112
we're going to reveal
in person four humans,

23:01.180 --> 23:05.483
one of whom actually appeared
in the "sorcerer's stone" film.

23:05.551 --> 23:09.453
Now, it's your job to figure
out which of the four people

23:09.522 --> 23:13.724
is the actual actor
who played the role on screen.

23:13.793 --> 23:14.875
Are you ready?

23:14.961 --> 23:16.560
- Absolutely.
- Yes.

23:16.629 --> 23:19.530
- Homenum revelio!

23:19.582 --> 23:23.300
Oh, I know
what character this was.

23:26.038 --> 23:27.805
I will tell you the one line

23:27.873 --> 23:31.208
that one of these gentlemen
famously delivered

23:31.260 --> 23:34.311
in king's cross station
over 20 years ago.

23:34.847 --> 23:37.314
Just have to get myself
together for this.

23:38.101 --> 23:40.684
[vocalizing]

23:45.741 --> 23:47.158
"9 3/4?

23:47.226 --> 23:49.193
You think you're being funny,
do ya?"

23:49.245 --> 23:51.779
- whoo!
- Yes!

23:51.864 --> 23:54.281
[cheers and applause]

23:55.401 --> 23:57.902
- so, hufflepuff,
for 50 points,

23:57.970 --> 24:01.455
which one of them delivered
that infamous line

24:01.541 --> 24:04.458
to a young harry potter
at king's cross station?

24:05.178 --> 24:06.343
- I remember
that this character

24:06.412 --> 24:09.513
looked like my dad
at the time.

24:09.582 --> 24:11.765
We are both clearly bald men.

24:11.851 --> 24:14.768
- D is too big and c
is too small,

24:14.854 --> 24:18.389
so I think we're down
to choosing between a and b.

24:18.441 --> 24:22.276
- I feel like I remember him
having a kind face.

24:22.361 --> 24:26.614
So I feel like
we should go with b.

24:26.699 --> 24:30.568
- Your decision is b?
- Yes.

24:32.572 --> 24:35.105
- Let's take a look
at the clip.

24:35.174 --> 24:36.674
<i> - Excuse me, sir.</i>

24:36.742 --> 24:39.043
Can you tell me where
I might find platform 9 3/4?

24:39.111 --> 24:40.377
- 9 3/4?

24:40.446 --> 24:42.079
Think you're being funny,
do ya?

24:42.148 --> 24:44.948
9 3/4...

24:45.001 --> 24:48.335
- Whoo!

24:48.421 --> 24:50.804
- "9 3/4?
Think you're funny, do ya?"

24:50.890 --> 24:53.924
- whoo!
- Yeah!

24:53.976 --> 24:58.929
- The most famous station guard
in the world, harry taylor.

25:01.133 --> 25:04.568
You know, most people don't
realize the years of training

25:04.637 --> 25:06.804
that we do
to play our big roles.

25:06.873 --> 25:09.106
So harry,
tell me, where did you train?

25:09.158 --> 25:10.807
- In a car.

25:10.860 --> 25:14.245
I was driving the director,
chris columbus, on the movie.

25:14.997 --> 25:16.363
- Oh, my god.

25:16.449 --> 25:18.148
- His children chose me,
his four children.

25:18.201 --> 25:20.668
- No!
Oh, really?

25:22.755 --> 25:24.205
Thank you, harry.

25:28.728 --> 25:32.129
So, slytherin, it's your turn
to play the game.

25:32.198 --> 25:33.681
Which one do you want?

25:33.766 --> 25:36.267
- My eye is drawn
to obscuro still.

25:36.335 --> 25:37.501
- I agree with that.
- Obscuro.

25:37.553 --> 25:38.936
- Yeah.
- Good.

25:39.005 --> 25:40.237
The obscuro charm

25:40.306 --> 25:42.106
puts a blindfold
over someone's eyes.

25:42.174 --> 25:46.277
So for us, this game is all
about what you can hear.

25:46.345 --> 25:49.113
So listen carefully

of, like, the train.

27:32.451 --> 27:33.801
when he was in his hut,

27:33.886 --> 27:37.788
handling
the soon-to-hatch dragon egg.

27:37.840 --> 27:39.023
- Ooh.

27:39.091 --> 27:41.558
- Which are the actual pair
of oven gloves

27:41.627 --> 27:43.594
that were used in the film?

27:44.764 --> 27:48.098
- Well, do any of them
smell like dragon?

27:50.019 --> 27:52.269
- Don't know if they would do,
like, a robbie coltrane-

27:52.338 --> 27:53.604
sized glove

27:53.656 --> 27:55.522
or they would
amp it up for hagrid.

27:55.608 --> 27:58.042
- Well, I'm thinking
about how big the egg is,

27:58.110 --> 27:59.643
which is about this big.

27:59.712 --> 28:04.481
I would throw out b and c
as being too big.

28:04.917 --> 28:08.502
I also think that if it were e,
this bright blue

28:08.587 --> 28:10.788
and white pattern,
that would've stood out.

28:10.840 --> 28:12.990

we would remember that.

28:14.510 --> 28:16.293
- Do you feel you have
an answer?

28:16.362 --> 28:17.661
- I think it could possibly
be d

28:17.713 --> 28:19.213
because they've dulled it
down enough

28:19.298 --> 28:20.497
that it's not too distracting.

28:20.549 --> 28:22.499
- Oh, yeah.
That's a good point.

28:22.568 --> 28:24.184
I say let's go with d.

28:24.270 --> 28:26.387
- Okay.
- Let's take a look.

28:27.440 --> 28:33.894
- Oh, ooh. Ooh.

28:33.979 --> 28:35.479
- So it's d.

28:35.531 --> 28:37.448
Congratulations.

28:37.516 --> 28:39.783
That's another 50 points
for hufflepuff.

28:41.353 --> 28:43.754
So slytherin, your turn.

28:43.823 --> 28:45.789
It's worth 50 points,
so it's a big one.

28:45.858 --> 28:47.524
- It might be better to go
with a known entity.

28:47.593 --> 28:49.326
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

28:49.395 --> 28:51.695
- We've done engorgio before,
and we've made it work twice.

28:51.764 --> 28:53.664
- I'll never say no
to engorgio.

28:55.568 --> 28:58.335
- Engorgio is, of course,
the engorgement charm,

28:58.404 --> 29:03.173
used to make regular things
grow extremely large.

29:03.676 --> 29:09.079
So this is an enlarged version
of an article of clothing

29:09.148 --> 29:12.683

in "the sorcerer's stone."

29:13.152 --> 29:14.184

29:14.236 --> 29:15.686
- It's definitely pajamas.

29:15.755 --> 29:17.271
I think we can all agree
on that,

29:17.356 --> 29:18.555
just by the pattern alone.

29:18.607 --> 29:19.656
They're tight pj pants.

29:19.725 --> 29:20.824
They're not billowy and loose.

29:20.893 --> 29:22.226
- Yeah, they're not billowy.

29:22.294 --> 29:23.861
It's definitely dudley.

29:23.913 --> 29:25.763
- Cousin dudley.
- Cousin dudley.

29:28.701 --> 29:31.201

42:11.263 --> 42:13.930
- Yes, well, I am studying
this carefully,

42:13.999 --> 42:15.882
trying to figure out
where it would fit in

42:15.967 --> 42:18.101
with the décor of my apartment.

42:19.671 --> 42:23.690
- And I have to say, slytherin
were very noble opponents

42:23.775 --> 42:25.007
as well, weren't they?

42:25.060 --> 42:28.311
A grand, grand game.

42:28.363 --> 42:31.381
- Being here with people who
love the same story you do--

42:31.449 --> 42:33.416
there is nothing
more incredible than that.

42:33.485 --> 42:36.569
- And I really get that feeling
of a community here,

42:36.655 --> 42:38.454
which is so lovely.

42:38.523 --> 42:41.074
- And may I just add,
we could not have had

42:41.159 --> 42:44.327
a more wonderful host
than with you, dame helen.

42:46.531 --> 42:51.200
- Ladies and gentlemen
and all the houses of hogwarts,

42:51.253 --> 42:56.639
please join me as I say
congratulations to the winners.

42:56.708 --> 42:58.675
It's hufflepuff house!

42:58.727 --> 43:01.945
[cheers and applause]

43:02.013 --> 43:03.379

43:07.819 --> 43:09.519

43:11.489 --> 43:15.124
That officially concludes
our tournament.

43:15.193 --> 43:18.094
It's been an honor to have been
a part of it,

43:18.163 --> 43:21.864
this truly magical celebration
of harry potter.

43:21.916 --> 43:24.200
We're all headed
to the leaky cauldron

43:24.269 --> 43:26.619
for butterbeers
and treacle tarts.

43:26.705 --> 43:32.592
The only thing left to say is
thank you so much for watching.

43:32.677 --> 43:35.878
I think I'm going
to miss this place.

43:35.930 --> 43:36.879
Good night!
