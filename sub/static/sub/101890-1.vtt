Johnny's gonna
take me by the hand.

00:20.795 --> 00:22.597
Oh, but then he's
gonna be my man!

00:24.799 --> 00:26.768
You're not gonna show
up tonight, are you?

00:26.801 --> 00:27.769
I'll be there around eight.

00:27.802 --> 00:29.537
I'll believe it when I see it.

00:29.571 --> 00:30.907
Everyone's coming.

00:30.940 --> 00:31.908
I gotta go.

00:31.941 --> 00:33.276
Later.

00:33.775 --> 00:34.809
Hey, munchkin!

00:34.843 --> 00:35.810
Hey stupid!

00:37.646 --> 00:38.613
Let's go, let's go.

00:38.647 --> 00:39.681
Okay.

00:39.714 --> 00:41.816
Chris Hemsworth steps
out of the shadows,

00:41.850 --> 00:43.718
just as Angela is
about to leave.

00:43.752 --> 00:47.156
Please accept these
as a token of my love.

00:47.189 --> 00:48.623
These, Chris Hemsworth?

00:48.657 --> 00:49.658
Are you kidding me?

00:49.691 --> 00:51.493
Come back with roses, you fool!

00:51.526 --> 00:52.861
Oh!

00:54.496 --> 00:55.864
Can I be the princess now?

00:55.898 --> 00:57.499
Once we've got
your homework done.

00:59.902 --> 01:01.670
The flower just
doesn't look right.

01:03.239 --> 01:04.572
See

01:05.274 --> 01:07.243
Ooh, that's actually better,

01:07.276 --> 01:08.277
now it looks like a flower.

01:17.552 --> 01:19.021
Oh, we learned some
new moves today.

01:19.055 --> 01:20.022
Ooh!

01:20.056 --> 01:21.023
Ready?

01:21.057 --> 01:22.124
Yes.

♪ Two, four, six, eight ♪

01:23.926 --> 01:25.328
Who do we appreciate?

01:25.361 --> 01:29.065
Go, Maddie, Angie and God

01:30.732 --> 01:33.069
Soon, you'll be cheerleader
captain like mom was!

01:33.102 --> 01:34.103
Definitely.

01:37.605 --> 01:39.075
Oh.

01:39.108 --> 01:40.443
Why do they always do this?

01:40.475 --> 01:42.011
I'm hungry now!

01:42.044 --> 01:44.981
Is dad going to still
take you to your party?

01:45.014 --> 01:47.615
How about I make you
some mac and cheese?

01:47.649 --> 01:48.985
Okay.

01:54.556 --> 01:56.425
Silly me, that
came out of nowhere.

01:56.459 --> 01:58.260
Okay, I finished!

02:01.897 --> 02:05.600
Oh, I love it, okay.

02:05.633 --> 02:07.370
I'm done with mine.

02:11.273 --> 02:12.241
Okay.

02:12.274 --> 02:13.242
There you go.

02:13.275 --> 02:14.276
Look at that.

02:15.411 --> 02:16.445
They're matching.

02:16.479 --> 02:17.446
Perfect.

02:18.481 --> 02:19.581
They match.

02:19.614 --> 02:22.952
All right, and I've got
something else for you.

02:24.853 --> 02:26.821
Happy birthday beautiful.

02:26.855 --> 02:27.856
Thank you.

02:35.563 --> 02:37.033
Thank you for everything.

02:38.367 --> 02:41.470
I never had a real
birthday before.

02:41.504 --> 02:42.704
Of course.

02:42.737 --> 02:44.106
You'll have many
more to come too.

02:48.210 --> 02:49.245
I should go get that.

02:49.278 --> 02:50.479
All right.

02:50.513 --> 02:53.215
I'll be back and
then we'll clean up.

03:23.678 --> 03:25.680
I've missed you.

03:29.085 --> 03:30.453
It's time to come home now.

03:31.719 --> 03:35.657
Coco, you think that she
really cares about you?

03:37.792 --> 03:39.861
When you turn 18,
she's gonna throw you

03:39.895 --> 03:42.131
on the street like
all the rest of them.

03:42.164 --> 03:43.432
And then what are you
gonna do then, huh?

03:43.466 --> 03:44.666
Who's gonna take care of you?

03:44.699 --> 03:46.102
This is a shelter.

03:46.135 --> 03:47.570
And they'll call the police.

03:49.438 --> 03:50.772
Yeah?

03:51.207 --> 03:52.874
They could,

03:56.045 --> 03:58.114
but you'll be dead
before they get here

03:58.147 --> 03:59.181
and so will she.

03:59.215 --> 04:00.449
She looks like a nice person.

04:00.483 --> 04:02.251
I don't want to
have to go inside.

04:02.284 --> 04:03.953
Come on.

04:04.987 --> 04:06.222
Come on.

04:14.829 --> 04:16.499
Good girl.

04:19.701 --> 04:21.370
Come on.

04:22.204 --> 04:24.039
I got you.

04:29.245 --> 04:30.579
Zoe?

04:53.536 --> 04:54.869
Zoe!

05:07.650 --> 05:08.617
Yeah.

05:08.651 --> 05:09.618
Rachel's on line one.

05:09.652 --> 05:11.654
She says it's urgent.

05:12.655 --> 05:15.024
Oh my
God, they found Zoe.

05:15.057 --> 05:16.125
They found her
and they took her.

05:16.158 --> 05:17.426
Okay.

05:17.459 --> 05:19.094
- I just know they did.
- Okay, calm down.

05:19.995 --> 05:21.664
Don't worry, we'll find her.

05:22.764 --> 05:24.500
- Oh my God.
- I'm on my way.

05:29.972 --> 05:31.207
I emailed the plumber

05:31.240 --> 05:33.175
to come in an hour
earlier tomorrow.

05:33.209 --> 05:35.244
Did you remember to
call the plumber?

05:35.277 --> 05:37.012
Yes, everything's
under control.

05:37.046 --> 05:40.249
Let's just relax with the girls
and have some pizza, okay?

05:55.797 --> 05:56.764
Munchkin.

05:56.798 --> 05:57.933
It's bedtime, come on.

05:57.967 --> 05:58.968
Hi, daddy.

05:59.001 --> 06:00.502
Hey, sweetheart.

06:00.536 --> 06:01.904
Atta girl.

06:01.937 --> 06:03.305
Good night princess.

06:03.339 --> 06:04.306
- Good night mommy.
- That's it.

06:04.340 --> 06:06.208
Let's get you to sleep.

06:06.242 --> 06:07.243
I'll put you to bed.

06:10.613 --> 06:11.914
Hi, sweet girl.

06:13.616 --> 06:15.117
You promised I
could go out tonight.

06:15.150 --> 06:16.352
I know, I know sweetheart.

06:16.385 --> 06:17.386
I'm a terrible mom,

06:17.419 --> 06:19.688
but there'll be more parties.

06:21.223 --> 06:22.424
Did you do your homework?

06:22.458 --> 06:23.692
Uh huh.

06:23.726 --> 06:25.628
Don't forget to
say your prayers.

06:25.661 --> 06:27.663
God is listening.

06:27.997 --> 06:30.566
At least when we lived in
West Adams we had a life.

06:32.301 --> 06:34.303
Didn't we, dad?

06:35.437 --> 06:36.438
Good night kido.

06:37.706 --> 06:39.041
What if mom and
dad come back early

06:39.074 --> 06:40.476
and we're not there?

06:40.509 --> 06:42.177
Worry, worry, worry!

06:42.211 --> 06:44.179
You're just like mom!

06:44.213 --> 06:46.814
Hey, aren't you sick of
being stuck at home all day?

06:47.683 --> 06:49.585
I want ice cream.

06:49.618 --> 06:52.421
Hey, did daddy give
Maddie her pocket money?

06:52.454 --> 06:53.422
No.

06:53.455 --> 06:54.690
Me neither!

06:54.723 --> 06:56.925
Hey, you know what dad
used to do when I was little?

06:56.959 --> 06:58.060
Yeah, busking!

06:58.093 --> 06:59.561
Okay, let's do it.

07:02.131 --> 07:03.098
What song are you
gonna play first?

07:03.132 --> 07:05.100
I don't know.

07:05.134 --> 07:06.602
Maybe I'll do your favorite.

07:06.635 --> 07:08.836
Yeah.

07:08.870 --> 07:09.871

lectured me on this.

passion killers.

14:56.172 --> 14:58.440
They just don't understand you.

15:43.186 --> 15:45.087
You would do that?

15:45.121 --> 15:46.388
yeah-I would do that.

15:49.025 --> 15:51.260
I really believe in you, Angie.

16:07.409 --> 16:10.313
Let's just.. let's take it slow.

16:12.514 --> 16:13.849
Okay.

16:15.284 --> 16:16.886
I guess we should
probably get out of here.

16:16.919 --> 16:18.254
Sure.

16:51.586 --> 16:54.823
Angie?

16:54.856 --> 16:56.359
Did you go out?

16:56.391 --> 16:58.227
Maddie, what are you doing up?

16:58.261 --> 16:59.594
I couldn't sleep.

16:59.628 --> 17:00.795
I had a bad dream.

17:00.829 --> 17:01.796
Can I sleep with you?

17:01.830 --> 17:02.999
Sure.

17:06.969 --> 17:08.837
Do you have a boyfriend?

17:11.640 --> 17:14.343
You can't say a
word Maddie, promise!

17:15.243 --> 17:16.678
Okay, I won't.

17:17.779 --> 17:18.747
For $10!

17:18.780 --> 17:19.915
All right, get in.

17:19.949 --> 17:21.782
Okay.

17:24.020 --> 17:25.253
Do have a good night?

17:25.288 --> 17:26.521
I did, did you?

17:27.689 --> 17:30.293
Yeah, besides
my horrible dream.

17:31.327 --> 17:33.296
Yes, I know we're behind.

17:37.033 --> 17:38.667
Yes, I understand
your concerns but...

17:38.700 --> 17:39.668
Girls?

17:39.701 --> 17:41.103
Yes, yes.

17:41.137 --> 17:42.104
- Hey.
- Yes?

17:42.138 --> 17:43.172
I need coffee, okay?

17:43.205 --> 17:45.007
One of them matches,
thanks to mom,

17:45.041 --> 17:46.641
and I am so not ready.

17:46.675 --> 17:47.842
You're
gonna do great.

17:47.877 --> 17:49.811
I understand your
concerns but...

17:51.247 --> 17:54.116
Yes, please calm down. We're
gonna get it done in time.

17:54.716 --> 17:55.684
Mom, don't forget
about tonight!

17:55.717 --> 17:57.320
Shhh.

17:57.353 --> 17:58.520
Yes.

17:58.553 --> 17:59.621
Tell him that we've
hired extra crew.

17:59.654 --> 18:00.622
Oh, yeah, and...

18:00.655 --> 18:01.924
Let's just go.

18:01.958 --> 18:03.292
Yes.

18:04.193 --> 18:05.161
- Don't forget your food.
- Yes, we're now

18:05.194 --> 18:06.228
hiring an extra crew.

18:07.729 --> 18:10.099
Yeah, totally, absolutely, yes.

18:10.132 --> 18:11.400
100% covered.

18:26.415 --> 18:27.383
Where are you?

18:27.416 --> 18:28.384
It's about to start.

18:28.417 --> 18:29.986
Come on dear, you're up next.

18:40.363 --> 18:41.696
Angie,

18:45.867 --> 18:48.237
you played beautifully tonight.

18:48.270 --> 18:50.306
It's a shame your
parents couldn't make it.

18:50.339 --> 18:52.174
They would be really proud.

18:52.208 --> 18:54.043
Now, is anyone coming
to pick you up?

18:54.076 --> 18:55.344
Yeah, someone's coming.

18:55.378 --> 18:57.213
Okay, yeah.

19:05.221 --> 19:06.554
Hey

19:08.790 --> 19:11.260
I came as soon as
I got your text.

19:11.293 --> 19:14.230
Can you believe
they didn't show up?

19:14.263 --> 19:15.597
Yeah.

19:17.199 --> 19:20.436
Well, you did well, right?

19:20.469 --> 19:23.838
Yeah, but I was off
key the entire time.

19:26.641 --> 19:29.078
I'm sure you did way better
than you think you did.

19:31.213 --> 19:33.215
You just gotta take
your mind off it.

19:35.985 --> 19:38.087
I was on my way to see my uncle.

19:38.120 --> 19:39.188
He just got in town.

19:40.588 --> 19:42.425
You should come.

19:43.591 --> 19:46.195
Angie, I told him all about you

19:46.228 --> 19:47.263
and he really wants to meet you.

19:47.296 --> 19:49.331
I don't know.

19:49.365 --> 19:50.565
It will be fun.

19:50.598 --> 19:52.734
He said he can help
you with music stuff.

19:52.767 --> 19:57.073
Hey, you are a great musician.

19:57.106 --> 19:58.773
I wouldn't lie.

19:59.641 --> 20:01.010
I'm parked right
down the street.

20:06.614 --> 20:09.651
All right, fine.

20:10.785 --> 20:11.753
You got me.

20:11.786 --> 20:12.754
Yeah, I'll carry your stuff.

20:12.787 --> 20:14.390
Thank you.

20:33.576 --> 20:36.112
I'm just letting my
uncle know we're here.

20:36.145 --> 20:37.480
Sure.

20:45.121 --> 20:46.088
It's a cool place, right?

20:46.122 --> 20:47.456
Yeah, yeah.

20:47.490 --> 20:50.392
They do a lot of
great parties here.

20:50.426 --> 20:51.759
Wow!

20:52.194 --> 20:53.329
- Hi!
- Hi.

20:58.601 --> 20:59.701
How are you?

20:59.734 --> 21:00.702
Good.

21:00.735 --> 21:02.471
Mario, you weren't kidding.

21:04.039 --> 21:05.007
You're beautiful.

21:05.040 --> 21:06.075
Thank you.

21:06.108 --> 21:09.578
Yeah, so you wanna
go professional?

21:09.612 --> 21:11.147
I don't think I'm good enough.

21:11.180 --> 21:12.915
How about I be
the judge of that?

21:14.049 --> 21:16.418
Tell me a bit about
your experience.

21:16.452 --> 21:18.487
I've played
concerts, and solo,

21:18.521 --> 21:19.989
my teacher is Robin Penser.

21:21.023 --> 21:23.225
Excellent reputation.

21:23.259 --> 21:25.594
We have some great
musicians coming tonight,

21:25.628 --> 21:28.863
and my colleagues are
excited to meet you.

21:29.965 --> 21:33.002
Yeah, this is a great
opportunity Angie.

21:34.270 --> 21:35.571
Thank you, sir.

21:36.639 --> 21:38.641
It's my pleasure.

21:38.873 --> 21:40.009
Can I get you anything?

21:42.311 --> 21:43.913
How about some champagne?

21:43.946 --> 21:45.014
Yes!

21:45.047 --> 21:46.448
Some champagne.

21:46.482 --> 21:47.815
Come on, let's have a seat.

21:52.121 --> 21:53.788
We're home!

21:53.889 --> 21:55.357
Angie?

21:55.391 --> 21:58.427
You said Angie would be
back by seven to take over.

21:58.460 --> 21:59.428
Maddie is asleep now.

21:59.461 --> 22:00.930
Okay, where is she?

22:00.963 --> 22:03.032
Maddie said she had her
music presentation tonight.

22:03.065 --> 22:04.033
We thought you were there.

22:04.066 --> 22:05.201
Oh God, we were supposed to...

22:05.234 --> 22:06.435
God, was that today?

22:06.468 --> 22:07.937
I thought you put
it in the calendar.

22:07.970 --> 22:08.938
I thought you did.

22:08.971 --> 22:10.306
I didn't, no.

22:10.339 --> 22:13.442
Well, she can't still
be there now, right?

22:17.179 --> 22:19.014
Let's call her.

22:24.486 --> 22:26.655
Hi, Angie, it's mom and dad.

22:26.689 --> 22:28.123
Where are you?

22:28.157 --> 22:29.158
We're looking for you. You
know that you're not supposed

22:29.191 --> 22:30.659
to stay out past your curfew.

22:30.693 --> 22:32.394
We're sorry we missed
your presentation, honey.

22:32.428 --> 22:34.997
Please, call us, bye.

22:36.398 --> 22:38.833
Can you stay a little
longer? We'll pay you extra.

22:38.866 --> 22:39.834
Yeah, sure.

22:39.867 --> 22:41.070
Thank you.

22:41.103 --> 22:42.071
All right, let's go.

22:42.104 --> 22:43.539
Let's go to her school

22:43.572 --> 22:44.540
We'll be back.

22:44.573 --> 22:45.608
What's Janine's mother's name?

22:45.641 --> 22:48.177
- Louisa.
- Louisa.

22:48.210 --> 22:49.712
Thank you.

23:01.323 --> 23:02.992
I'm Ida.

23:06.395 --> 23:07.862
- Hi!
- Hi!

23:17.805 --> 23:19.608
Rob is gonna love you.

23:20.976 --> 23:23.746
He's one of the best
producers in the business.

23:23.778 --> 23:27.449
But, you know, you are judged
the second you walk in a room.

23:27.483 --> 23:31.353
So, let's add a pop of color

23:32.221 --> 23:33.188
Step it up a bit

23:33.222 --> 23:34.189
Yeah?

23:34.223 --> 23:35.224
Sure.

23:47.802 --> 23:49.705
Oh, can you get my bag?

23:49.738 --> 23:52.408
I should call my parents and
let them know where I am.

23:54.610 --> 23:55.711
I see.

23:55.744 --> 23:57.346
Rob is here.

23:57.379 --> 23:58.447
Just one more thing.

24:04.153 --> 24:05.521
Perfect.

24:05.554 --> 24:06.522
You're gorgeous.

24:06.555 --> 24:07.523
Oh, thank you.

24:07.556 --> 24:08.657
Gorgeous!

24:16.699 --> 24:17.766
It's gonna be good.

24:18.767 --> 24:19.902
She's gonna go alone.

24:20.903 --> 24:22.938
Rob doesn't like strangers, so.

24:22.971 --> 24:25.107
Yeah, I know, it's okay.

24:25.140 --> 24:26.475
Okay.

24:33.382 --> 24:34.849
Come on, it's gonna be fun.

24:54.103 --> 24:55.404
Big Rob.

24:55.437 --> 24:57.005
Deac

24:57.039 --> 24:58.873
We have a special
musician for you today.

25:00.743 --> 25:01.710
Welcome.

25:01.744 --> 25:03.345
So you're Angel, right?

25:03.379 --> 25:04.546
Oh, my name's Angie.

25:06.415 --> 25:08.484
Angel's a perfect
stage name for you.

25:10.386 --> 25:11.387
Let's hear you play.

25:27.870 --> 25:31.473
♪ Sleep my child and
peace attend thee ♪

25:35.978 --> 25:37.312
Relax.

25:49.024 --> 25:51.160
You're so talented.

25:52.494 --> 25:55.297
Very...

25:55.330 --> 25:57.666
...very...

25:57.699 --> 25:59.568
...talented.

26:05.040 --> 26:06.108
No, no, no.

26:09.211 --> 26:11.447
Stop!.

26:11.480 --> 26:12.781
No! Help me!

26:12.815 --> 26:14.183
Please.

26:16.118 --> 26:17.953
No, please!

26:18.854 --> 26:20.556
It looks like we
a successful date.

26:20.589 --> 26:22.391
$10,000!

26:24.159 --> 26:26.261
We gotta hand it to Mario.

26:26.295 --> 26:28.096
He's gonna up our
quota with this.

26:29.933 --> 26:31.433
She's gonna need
a bit of grooming.

27:00.496 --> 27:02.531
I brought you breakfast.

27:04.533 --> 27:06.401
You were a good girl last night.

27:07.736 --> 27:09.404
After you stopped whining.

27:19.081 --> 27:21.783
You wouldn't want your parents
to see that, would you?

27:22.751 --> 27:24.553
We can protect you.

27:24.586 --> 27:26.555
No one has to know.

27:27.389 --> 27:29.893
You just have to be good girl.

27:42.638 --> 27:45.073
You filed the missing
person report the same night,

27:45.107 --> 27:46.575
which was the right thing to do.

27:46.608 --> 27:49.144
This is Unit 267, we
have a critical missing.

27:49.177 --> 27:54.182
Age 16, dark blonde, blue
eyes, 5'5, 120 pounds.

27:55.584 --> 27:57.286
Answers to the name of Angie.

27:57.319 --> 27:59.989
It's two days and we still
haven't heard from her.

28:00.023 --> 28:01.657
Is there any reason
she would have run away?

28:01.690 --> 28:02.758
No, no.

28:02.791 --> 28:03.859
She would never run away.

28:03.893 --> 28:06.261
No, something's happened.

28:06.295 --> 28:07.796
I can feel it.

28:07.829 --> 28:09.064
She just gotta be out there.

28:09.097 --> 28:10.766
I mean,

28:11.099 --> 28:13.368
we just moved here a
couple of months ago,

28:13.402 --> 28:15.203
so, we've just been settling in.

28:15.237 --> 28:18.206
And then we were
gonna take a vacation.

28:19.875 --> 28:22.477
She was very much
looking forward to that.

28:22.511 --> 28:25.647
Does she have any
birthmarks or tattoos?

28:25.681 --> 28:27.749
Anything that can
help us identify her?

28:30.752 --> 28:33.455
As much information as
we can get will be helpful.

28:33.488 --> 28:37.026
She has a small
birthmark on her knee.

28:38.694 --> 28:39.795
Underneath her left knee.

28:39.828 --> 28:42.164
Does she have a boyfriend?

28:42.197 --> 28:43.865
No, she is a good girl.

28:43.900 --> 28:47.469
She doesn't have, a boyfriend

28:47.502 --> 28:49.171
She does have a boyfriend.

28:53.408 --> 28:55.344
She made me promise not to tell,

28:55.377 --> 28:57.846
but he'll bring
her back, won't he?

28:57.880 --> 28:59.916
Honey.

28:59.949 --> 29:01.084
Honey.

29:01.116 --> 29:02.317
Sweetie, do you know his name?

29:02.351 --> 29:04.753
He'll bring her
back, won't he?

29:10.927 --> 29:12.427
Arms up!

29:16.798 --> 29:18.133
Now!

29:25.574 --> 29:26.842
- Please.
- You look pretty.

29:26.875 --> 29:28.044
Please, just let me go home.

29:28.077 --> 29:29.045
Please.

29:29.078 --> 29:30.046
Please, let me go home.

29:30.079 --> 29:31.047
Please.

29:31.080 --> 29:33.315
Stop your whining.

29:33.348 --> 29:34.549
It's bad for business.

29:35.885 --> 29:37.452
It's very unattractive.

29:52.969 --> 29:54.202
Hey, sweetie.

29:56.805 --> 29:58.507
Please, please, please,
can you get me out of here?

29:58.540 --> 29:59.741
Please, get me out.

29:59.775 --> 30:01.376
Relax, daddy is gonna
take good care of you.

30:01.410 --> 30:03.245
- We just gonna have fun.
- No, no, no. Let me out!

30:03.278 --> 30:04.479
Please, let me out!

30:04.513 --> 30:05.982
- Girl, take it easy.
- No, no, no!

30:06.015 --> 30:06.983
Daddy is gonna take

30:07.016 --> 30:07.984
- good care of you.
- No, no, no!

30:08.017 --> 30:08.985
- Just relax.
- No!

30:09.018 --> 30:09.986
- Just relax!
- No!

30:10.019 --> 30:10.987
- Relax!
- No!

30:11.020 --> 30:11.988
All right?

30:12.021 --> 30:13.689
Be a good little girl
for daddy, all right?

30:28.171 --> 30:29.906
Daddy loves you baby.

30:40.950 --> 30:43.251
I looked everywhere.

30:43.285 --> 30:46.288
We just have to keep looking.

30:46.321 --> 30:47.823
No, don't.

30:48.356 --> 30:49.491
She's out there.

31:12.215 --> 31:17.220
Hey, it won't hurt
as much after a while.

31:18.988 --> 31:20.856
You're from a good
family, right?

31:23.558 --> 31:25.627
Most of us here don't
have any family.

31:28.330 --> 31:29.798
I'm Zoe.

31:30.365 --> 31:31.833
I'll look out for you.

31:37.439 --> 31:39.108
It's okay.

31:45.148 --> 31:46.381
Honey, here's your tea.

31:47.382 --> 31:48.517
You should get some rest.

31:48.550 --> 31:50.219
Take a shower.

31:50.452 --> 31:51.653
Okay?

31:53.256 --> 31:54.856
Solana's mom's here.

31:58.261 --> 31:59.228
Sweetie.

31:59.262 --> 32:00.495
Yeah?

32:01.063 --> 32:02.397
Don't talk to strangers

32:03.266 --> 32:04.833
Strangers?

32:04.866 --> 32:07.904
Strange men or boys or
any human in general.

32:07.937 --> 32:09.538
You keep telling me that.

32:09.571 --> 32:10.872
I know.

32:10.907 --> 32:12.474
I love you.

32:12.507 --> 32:13.675
I love you.

32:13.708 --> 32:14.776
Honey, let me
walk her out, okay?

32:14.810 --> 32:16.145
Yeah.

32:25.353 --> 32:26.588
The bitch bit me!

32:26.621 --> 32:28.824
Put a muzzle on her
or give me a refund.

32:28.857 --> 32:30.692
She bit you?

32:31.894 --> 32:33.262
All right.

32:33.296 --> 32:34.863
I'm gonna get you somebody
else, don't worry.

32:34.897 --> 32:37.532
preferably somebody
without teeth.

32:37.566 --> 32:38.935
Yeah, I got it.

32:38.968 --> 32:40.836
- Come here!
- No, no, no.

32:40.869 --> 32:42.071
Come here!

32:42.104 --> 32:43.572
No, no.

32:43.605 --> 32:46.741
Don't you ever pull a
stunt like that again.

32:51.513 --> 32:55.985
If you think that's
bad, just wait

32:56.018 --> 32:58.955
you'll see what happens
to Mario next time.

32:58.988 --> 33:02.457
I would hate to have
to ruin his good looks.

33:04.327 --> 33:05.328
You hear me?

33:13.735 --> 33:15.403
Get up!

33:24.180 --> 33:25.847
Get over there.

33:26.514 --> 33:28.184
Shut up!

33:36.125 --> 33:38.060
You know, it's easy to
take things for granted,

33:40.829 --> 33:42.697
simple things like food.

33:44.033 --> 33:47.103
Something you won't
have any of tomorrow,

33:47.136 --> 33:48.104
because of her.

33:48.137 --> 33:49.471
Your food is crap anyways.

33:49.504 --> 33:50.839
And so are you Deacon!

33:50.872 --> 33:52.874
What did you say?

33:55.777 --> 33:58.047
I'm sorry I, I
couldn't hear you.

33:59.781 --> 34:01.616
Stand up!

34:07.856 --> 34:09.091
Did you gain weight?

34:11.159 --> 34:12.793
You're gonna have
to work that off.

34:15.197 --> 34:18.167
So, you're gonna pick up Angel's
clients starting tonight.

34:18.199 --> 34:19.833
You won't be able
to walk for a week.

34:19.868 --> 34:21.237
How do you feel about that?

34:23.306 --> 34:24.606
You can't break me.

34:24.639 --> 34:27.342
We'll see what you'll
say about that tomorrow.

34:27.376 --> 34:28.777
Now, get out of my sight.

34:40.356 --> 34:42.058
See, the thing about it is,

34:44.427 --> 34:48.862
the more you work, the
better things will be.

34:51.934 --> 34:53.501
I don't wanna have to hurt you.

34:54.370 --> 34:55.404
So, pack up.

34:56.504 --> 34:58.407
Perk up your tits.

34:58.441 --> 35:01.410
Put your face on, get out
there and do some business.

35:01.444 --> 35:03.079
We have a lot of
clients tonight.

35:05.982 --> 35:07.984
On your feet.

35:11.053 --> 35:12.154
She stays.

35:14.689 --> 35:16.192
Get out!

35:51.894 --> 35:53.396
Come on!

36:04.539 --> 36:08.477
- Angie, Angie, Angie?
- Go away, go away, go away!

36:08.511 --> 36:09.478
Look at me.

36:09.512 --> 36:10.612
I need you to listen to me.

36:10.645 --> 36:12.281
Okay?

36:12.314 --> 36:13.282
No, please, please,
please get me out of here.

36:13.315 --> 36:14.682
Angie, be quiet.

36:14.716 --> 36:15.683
- Get me out of here.
- And listen.

36:15.717 --> 36:16.886
Get me out of here Mario.

36:16.919 --> 36:18.087
Mario, get me out of here.

36:18.120 --> 36:20.256
Angie, I'm so sorry
this is happening.

36:21.457 --> 36:24.193
But you need to calm
down and play along.

36:24.226 --> 36:26.295
Because they will hurt you.

36:26.328 --> 36:27.296
They will hurt you.

36:27.329 --> 36:28.630
Okay?

36:29.231 --> 36:30.466
I'm just like you.

36:32.368 --> 36:34.937
They used a baseball
bat on my arm.

36:34.970 --> 36:36.405
They're threatening my mom,

36:36.439 --> 36:39.308
and if you don't calm
down, they might kill me.

36:41.477 --> 36:42.811
Okay?

36:43.913 --> 36:47.049
No, no, no, no, please
just go to the cops.

36:47.083 --> 36:48.050
Something, please.

36:48.084 --> 36:49.485
I can't go to the cops.

36:49.518 --> 36:50.785
They know where
your parents live,

36:50.819 --> 36:52.188
they know who they are,

36:52.221 --> 36:54.023
and they will do
bad things to them.

36:55.824 --> 36:57.759
I will fix this.

36:57.792 --> 36:58.928
I promise.

36:58.961 --> 37:00.896
- No.
- I promise I will fix this.

37:00.930 --> 37:02.131
No.

37:02.164 --> 37:03.132
I have to go before
they catch me with you.

37:03.165 --> 37:04.533
No, please don't leave me.

37:04.567 --> 37:05.733
Please, please,
you can't leave me.

37:05.767 --> 37:06.734
I love you, Angie.

37:06.768 --> 37:07.735
You can't leave me.

37:07.769 --> 37:08.736
- I love you.
- You can't leave me,

37:08.770 --> 37:10.573
you're my only hope.

37:11.673 --> 37:12.942
No, no, no, no!

37:16.545 --> 37:17.712
No, no, Mario!

37:19.448 --> 37:22.017
Mario.

37:54.984 --> 37:56.318
Of course.

37:56.352 --> 37:57.652
You gotta
take what you can.

37:57.685 --> 37:58.653
Of course,
these days are cruel.

37:58.686 --> 37:59.821
Yeah, you can't be
picky.

38:06.996 --> 38:08.264
Sit!

38:15.237 --> 38:17.039
- How's it going, man?
- It's good to see you.

38:17.072 --> 38:19.208
Good to see you brother.

38:33.923 --> 38:35.157
turn your head.

38:40.663 --> 38:42.164
Don't move.

38:56.512 --> 38:58.514
Back to work!

39:02.518 --> 39:04.019
I'll see you later.

39:07.590 --> 39:10.025
Mia, you're next.

39:19.435 --> 39:20.835
Turn your head.

39:39.622 --> 39:41.257
How can you pray?

39:41.290 --> 39:43.758
It's the one thing
they can't take from us.

39:50.532 --> 39:54.336
Do you think they would
really hurt my family?

39:54.370 --> 39:58.340
These people are
bad, really bad.

40:01.776 --> 40:03.879
My dad gave me
a topaz ring once,

40:04.947 --> 40:06.715
for my birthday.

40:06.749 --> 40:08.417
You're lucky.

40:09.418 --> 40:11.654
I've been in so
many foster homes.

40:12.854 --> 40:14.723
Each one was worse
than the last one.

40:17.393 --> 40:18.894
The woman who gave me this,

40:21.497 --> 40:24.099
she's the only person who
has ever been nice to me.

40:28.037 --> 40:30.306
Your parents are
probably looking for you.

40:31.507 --> 40:33.609
Just stay alive
until they find you.

40:52.628 --> 40:57.599
What I'm about to show you
is not an easy thing to see.

40:57.633 --> 40:59.834
We believe that your
daughter has been trafficked

40:59.867 --> 41:03.005
and is being sold
on an online site.

41:04.773 --> 41:06.108
What?

41:09.278 --> 41:10.845
I know this is tough to do,

41:12.448 --> 41:16.652
but I need you to confirm
that this is your daughter.

41:27.996 --> 41:29.064
Oh, my God.

41:31.166 --> 41:33.736
We recognized this tattoo.

41:33.769 --> 41:38.774
It's from a local gang that
specializes in underage girls.

41:39.508 --> 41:40.843
They're all over LA,

41:40.875 --> 41:43.145
but now that you've
identified her,

41:43.178 --> 41:45.581
we can set up a sting
operation next weekend.

41:45.614 --> 41:47.349
Next weekend?

41:47.383 --> 41:48.350
Are you crazy?

41:48.384 --> 41:50.519
Jesus, you gotta get her now!

41:50.552 --> 41:52.521
We don't know where
they're holding her, ma'am.

41:52.554 --> 41:54.056
There's got to be
something more you can do.

41:54.089 --> 41:57.459
Believe me, if there
was, we'd be doing it.

41:57.493 --> 41:59.461
If we move too soon on this,

42:00.662 --> 42:04.199
they could go dark and
we'll lose her forever.

42:04.233 --> 42:05.667
Please.

42:05.701 --> 42:06.902
I'll be in touch.

42:06.935 --> 42:07.970
You have my word.

42:19.481 --> 42:21.216
No, no, no, no, no!

42:24.686 --> 42:26.822
Please don't, please
don't.

42:29.091 --> 42:33.462
Walk around, smile, serve
drinks, change chip bowls

42:33.495 --> 42:34.463
it's easy.

42:34.496 --> 42:35.664
Easy stuff.

42:35.697 --> 42:37.633
Okay, I trust you.

42:37.666 --> 42:38.767
All right, here we go.

42:38.801 --> 42:40.035
Big weekend.

42:40.068 --> 42:41.804
We've got lots of
work to do ladies.

42:43.639 --> 42:45.641
Let's go, move it!

42:49.044 --> 42:50.880
Come here.

42:51.513 --> 42:52.748
Yeah?

42:52.781 --> 42:54.149
Maybe put your
hair up next time.

42:54.183 --> 42:55.851
Let's go.

42:56.952 --> 42:58.954
All right, yeah let's go.

43:04.026 --> 43:04.993
This is the the boss.

43:05.027 --> 43:06.795
His name is Deacon.

43:06.829 --> 43:08.163
Deacon.

43:10.934 --> 43:12.034
This is Zelda.

43:12.067 --> 43:13.068
She looks good.

43:13.101 --> 43:14.069
Nice.

43:14.102 --> 43:15.571
Come on.

43:16.305 --> 43:17.873
Change of plans, I
need you to drive.

43:17.907 --> 43:19.909
- Okay.
- How do you know Mario?

43:19.943 --> 43:21.043
Who?

43:21.076 --> 43:22.110
They guy that brought you.

43:22.144 --> 43:23.212
Oh, that's Mark.

43:23.245 --> 43:24.446
He's my boyfriend.

43:24.480 --> 43:26.148
Got me this job
helping out at parties.

43:26.181 --> 43:27.449
He says it pays well.

43:28.383 --> 43:30.552
Does it?

43:30.686 --> 43:31.820
Let it go, Angie.

43:32.688 --> 43:33.722
Wait, what?

43:35.090 --> 43:39.294
Hey, I don't want
any trouble from you.

43:40.162 --> 43:41.163
You hear me?

43:44.566 --> 43:46.735
Get in.

43:51.073 --> 43:52.341
Get in the van!

43:54.042 --> 43:55.879
No.

43:56.044 --> 43:57.546
No, no, no, no!

43:57.579 --> 43:59.081
Let's go!

44:03.418 --> 44:04.653
Mark?

44:50.566 --> 44:51.700
Let's go ladies.

44:51.733 --> 44:53.402
Come on.

45:00.642 --> 45:03.645
Well, faster
please, thank you.

45:08.650 --> 45:10.152
Hold on.

45:14.723 --> 45:16.858
She'll party in 5, on 05 for
you.

45:25.601 --> 45:27.102
This is you.

46:12.180 --> 46:14.716
'Bout time little angel
got some of the rough ones.

46:14.750 --> 46:15.751
Leave her alone.

46:44.914 --> 46:46.581
How's it going?

46:47.315 --> 46:49.018
You the three o'clock?

46:49.052 --> 46:50.352
I don't see anyone else.

46:51.286 --> 46:52.421
Funny man, huh?

46:53.522 --> 46:55.357
Where are you from?

46:55.457 --> 46:56.758
Miami.

46:57.292 --> 46:58.627
Do you wanna feel that too?

46:59.996 --> 47:01.329
Not really.

47:01.663 --> 47:03.365
How long are you in LA for?

47:03.398 --> 47:05.500
I just came out for the game;

47:05.534 --> 47:06.702
thought I'd have some
fun for the night.

47:06.735 --> 47:07.836
All right, let's go.

47:20.116 --> 47:21.316
After you.

47:21.349 --> 47:22.684
Thanks.

47:26.722 --> 47:28.457
This is it, huh?

47:28.490 --> 47:29.926
Yeah, this is it.

47:29.959 --> 47:31.194
You got something for me?

47:31.226 --> 47:32.561
Oh.

47:35.164 --> 47:37.365
It's all there, you
can count if you want.

47:37.399 --> 47:38.366
Yeah, I will.

47:38.400 --> 47:39.568
Thanks.

47:40.836 --> 47:42.504
Okay.

47:42.804 --> 47:44.473
I'll be back.

47:58.087 --> 48:01.289
Angel, you got another client.

48:01.323 --> 48:02.324
Seriously?

48:03.625 --> 48:05.460
Look at her.

48:17.039 --> 48:18.707
You're up.

48:27.150 --> 48:29.618
I asked for a fresh red head.

48:29.651 --> 48:32.654
She's fresh, and she
just dyed her hair.

48:40.862 --> 48:43.532
No, no, I'm not here for that.

48:48.503 --> 48:50.239
How old are you?

48:50.273 --> 48:51.473
18.

48:51.506 --> 48:52.741
Are you being held
against your will?

48:54.076 --> 48:56.145
Do you know this girl?

48:56.179 --> 48:58.014
Angie Morgan.

48:59.414 --> 49:01.250
She's 16.

49:02.818 --> 49:03.986
Please, talk to me.

49:04.020 --> 49:06.122
We can help you get
out of here too.

49:36.685 --> 49:38.520
I don't think so buddy.

49:41.556 --> 49:42.524
Go to sleep.

49:42.557 --> 49:43.859
We're going in.

49:43.893 --> 49:45.393
Rodriguez, stay with that van.

49:46.761 --> 49:48.030
Come here.

49:48.064 --> 49:49.531
You're gonna regret that.

49:49.564 --> 49:50.900
Flynn!

49:51.466 --> 49:53.435
Flynn, get the car.

49:53.468 --> 49:55.470
It's was a trap.

49:57.772 --> 49:59.041
Let's go!

49:59.075 --> 50:00.276
Now!

50:00.309 --> 50:01.710
Move, move, move!

50:04.981 --> 50:06.148
Go on, go, go.

50:13.455 --> 50:14.456
Over here.

50:15.423 --> 50:16.391
Liam?

50:16.424 --> 50:17.960
They have the Morgan girl.

50:17.994 --> 50:19.494
Down the hall.

50:28.070 --> 50:29.404
Clear.

50:34.076 --> 50:35.810
They must have taken
another vehicle.

51:03.272 --> 51:06.142
Do you think anyone
gives a crap about you?

51:06.175 --> 51:10.313
We give you a place to
sleep, food, clothes,

51:10.346 --> 51:13.049
we protect you, care for you.

51:13.082 --> 51:15.918
You don't appreciate
it, bad things happen.

51:20.655 --> 51:24.427
You try to run, we
break your legs.

51:24.459 --> 51:26.395
For those of you who talk...

51:31.466 --> 51:32.701
I can make this messy.

51:34.636 --> 51:36.305
Your choice.

51:37.006 --> 51:38.673
Open up.

51:39.774 --> 51:41.177
Open up, open up.

51:52.520 --> 51:53.488
Get her cleaned up.

51:53.521 --> 51:54.856
Get her back to work.

51:56.758 --> 51:58.860
You belong to me.

51:58.894 --> 52:00.795
You follow my rules.

52:00.829 --> 52:03.299
Do you think the cops
are gonna help you?

52:03.332 --> 52:04.766
They are on my payroll.

52:08.837 --> 52:11.873
If you try to leave,
we will find you,

52:13.209 --> 52:15.978
and we will find your family.

52:26.322 --> 52:28.891
Hurry up, please come on mom.

52:28.924 --> 52:30.159
I don't wanna be late.

52:36.598 --> 52:38.100
Where did you
get that make up?

52:38.134 --> 52:39.335
It was Angie's.

52:39.368 --> 52:40.503
No, you don't
go into her room.

52:40.535 --> 52:42.071
Those are her things.

52:42.104 --> 52:44.173
She's not coming
back, so why not?

52:44.206 --> 52:45.174
Yes, she is.

52:45.207 --> 52:46.509
Don't you say that!

52:46.541 --> 52:47.642
She's coming back.

52:47.675 --> 52:48.843
How do you know?

52:48.877 --> 52:50.645
You don't even
know where she is!

52:56.519 --> 52:57.852
Hey!

53:07.662 --> 53:10.499
Commando, how are
you doing my man?

53:10.533 --> 53:11.500
Doing great.

53:11.534 --> 53:13.502
Good to see you.

53:13.536 --> 53:14.736
Sit down.

53:17.839 --> 53:21.277
How's it going?

53:25.314 --> 53:26.282
Hey, you?

53:26.315 --> 53:27.283
Gentlemen.

53:27.316 --> 53:28.284
How're you enjoying tonight?

53:28.317 --> 53:29.684
Hey, how are you sir?

53:29.717 --> 53:31.153
You got something for me?

53:31.187 --> 53:32.221
I do.

53:32.254 --> 53:33.923
She's fresh.

53:34.290 --> 53:35.491
Green top right there.

53:38.027 --> 53:38.994
I like it.

53:39.028 --> 53:39.995
Enjoy.

53:40.029 --> 53:42.864
Thank you.

53:47.503 --> 53:50.206
Would you like to dance?

53:50.239 --> 53:52.208
Ivo!

54:01.749 --> 54:03.852
I see you.

54:03.886 --> 54:04.920
- Yeah.
- How are you doing buddy?

54:04.954 --> 54:05.921
I'm always good.

54:05.955 --> 54:07.089
What do you got going on?

54:07.123 --> 54:11.060
I got grade A quality
for you tonight buddy.

54:11.093 --> 54:12.760
She's gonna make
you a lot of money.

54:12.794 --> 54:15.064
I heard you've been
having some problems.

54:16.098 --> 54:18.200
Yeah, but we worked it out.

54:18.234 --> 54:21.437
Plus they're not gonna
be looking in Florida.

54:21.470 --> 54:23.139
You're gonna be safe.

54:23.172 --> 54:24.140
40K.

54:28.043 --> 54:29.879
She's worth it.

54:31.514 --> 54:32.714
All right.

54:32.747 --> 54:33.715
She's gonna
make you a lot of money.

54:33.748 --> 54:36.085
Yeah, it's real nice.

54:36.118 --> 54:37.785
I say 20K.

54:42.824 --> 54:44.560
20 grand, huh?

54:44.593 --> 54:45.928
20K.

54:45.961 --> 54:47.263
Deal.

54:47.296 --> 54:48.631
Deal.

54:49.198 --> 54:50.533
For you.

54:57.705 --> 54:58.806
It's okay.

54:58.840 --> 55:00.342
Wanna see us dance together?

55:01.410 --> 55:02.744
Yeah.

55:04.712 --> 55:06.215
They're taking you
to Miami tonight.

55:06.248 --> 55:07.349
What?

55:07.383 --> 55:09.084
We gotta get out of here.

55:09.118 --> 55:10.486
Are you crazy?

55:10.519 --> 55:12.321
Didn't you hear me?

55:12.354 --> 55:14.323
Deacon sold you to Ivan.

55:14.356 --> 55:17.026
He's taking you to Miami and
once you go across state lines,

55:17.059 --> 55:18.594
no one's going to find you.

55:18.627 --> 55:20.129
I can't leave L.A, Zoe.

55:20.162 --> 55:21.530
I can't leave you.

55:21.564 --> 55:26.569
Okay, go sit on his
lap, just for a minute.

55:27.436 --> 55:28.836
When you see me nod at you,

55:28.870 --> 55:30.906
say you have to go to the
bathroom and meet me by the bar.

55:50.125 --> 55:51.360
I have to go to the bathroom.

55:51.393 --> 55:52.727
Just one minute.

55:57.666 --> 55:58.634
I know.

55:58.667 --> 56:00.302
Trust me, I got your back.

56:00.336 --> 56:01.303
- Hey!
- You don't need

56:01.337 --> 56:02.304
to worry about it.

56:02.338 --> 56:04.406
What happened to the girl?

56:04.440 --> 56:06.242
The green top ran out.

56:06.275 --> 56:07.610
She ran out?

56:07.643 --> 56:08.978
Yeah.

56:12.581 --> 56:14.650
Okay, here we go.

56:14.683 --> 56:15.750
Quick Angie.

56:15.783 --> 56:17.353
Hurry, hurry!

56:17.386 --> 56:18.687
Go faster.

56:18.721 --> 56:20.289
Faster, hurry Angie.

56:20.322 --> 56:23.626
Come on.

56:25.427 --> 56:27.162
You are not going anywhere.

56:27.196 --> 56:28.364
Let her go!

56:28.397 --> 56:29.365
Let go.

56:29.398 --> 56:30.899
Let go, you're mine!

56:37.973 --> 56:39.375
Please, please,
please, please,

56:39.408 --> 56:40.442
- you have to help me.
- Sorry, I can't help you.

56:40.476 --> 56:41.809
Crazy.

57:36.799 --> 57:37.766
Honey!

57:37.800 --> 57:39.468
There's a girl in the playhouse!

57:39.501 --> 57:41.003
I think something's
wrong with her.

57:41.036 --> 57:42.705
Call the police.

57:44.039 --> 57:45.374
Hi!

57:46.141 --> 57:47.810
Angie, right?

57:49.678 --> 57:51.380
It's okay, it's okay.

57:51.413 --> 57:53.082
I'm Detective Chase Dawson.

57:54.616 --> 57:57.886
This is Rachel Martinez,
she's a caseworker.

57:57.920 --> 57:59.655
And this is Detective Warren.

58:03.659 --> 58:05.327
Is this you?

58:06.762 --> 58:08.764
You're Angie Morgan?

58:09.998 --> 58:12.034
It's all right.

58:12.067 --> 58:13.102
It's you, isn't it?

58:15.671 --> 58:16.672
Thank you, Angie.

58:23.479 --> 58:26.448
Hey Angie.

58:26.482 --> 58:27.850
It's okay.

58:28.717 --> 58:30.018
I brought you some things.

58:34.590 --> 58:38.761
I'm just gonna place this
right next to you, okay?

58:41.697 --> 58:43.198
I'm here to help you.

58:45.934 --> 58:49.004
I'm just gonna take a seat
right over there, okay?

59:01.049 --> 59:03.051
Oh my God.

59:06.188 --> 59:07.556
It's okay, Angie.

59:09.425 --> 59:10.626
Can I have a quick word?

59:23.138 --> 59:24.773
I'm Rachel Martinez;

59:24.807 --> 59:27.676
I've been assigned as your
daughter's caseworker.

59:27.709 --> 59:30.412
The doctors would like to
put Angie on a 72 hour hold.

59:31.580 --> 59:33.615
We can take care
of her, please.

59:33.649 --> 59:36.018
She's been through
a lot of trauma.

59:36.051 --> 59:37.186
She needs to be here.

59:48.230 --> 59:51.166
It's okay.

59:53.335 --> 59:54.670
Angie?

59:54.703 --> 59:58.273
We're gonna
take you home.

01:00:00.075 --> 01:00:01.911
Very soon, we're
gonna take you home.

01:00:26.401 --> 01:00:27.971
Hey, Ange.

01:00:28.003 --> 01:00:29.338
It's me.

01:00:32.841 --> 01:00:34.176
Maddie,

01:00:37.412 --> 01:00:40.249
let's let Angie get some rest.

01:00:40.282 --> 01:00:41.617
Okay?

01:00:41.985 --> 01:00:44.988
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:46.688
Thank you so much.

01:00:55.664 --> 01:00:57.332
It's really good
to have you home.

01:01:01.837 --> 01:01:04.908
We are gonna let you
get comfortable, okay?

01:01:04.941 --> 01:01:07.442
We'll be downstairs
if you need anything.

01:01:23.692 --> 01:01:26.361
Hey, it's gonna be okay.

01:01:30.399 --> 01:01:32.134
There you go.

01:01:32.167 --> 01:01:33.903
Any update on Angel?

01:01:33.937 --> 01:01:35.103
Ivan's not happy.

01:01:36.305 --> 01:01:37.372
Not yet, but when
the heat dies down,

01:01:37.406 --> 01:01:39.241
we'll get her back.

01:01:39.274 --> 01:01:40.475
Don't worry.

01:01:40.509 --> 01:01:42.177
Ida, your new cleaner is here.

01:01:44.546 --> 01:01:45.514
Hi!

01:01:51.386 --> 01:01:52.654
How old is she?

01:01:52.688 --> 01:01:54.222
She just turned one.

01:01:56.191 --> 01:01:57.526
Hey.

01:01:58.226 --> 01:02:01.597
So, he was saying that
I could keep her with me

01:02:01.630 --> 01:02:03.098
while I work.

01:02:03.131 --> 01:02:05.133
Otherwise, I could
only do certain hours.

01:02:05.167 --> 01:02:06.936
It's fine.

01:02:06.970 --> 01:02:09.171
I can take care of her
while you're working.

01:02:12.774 --> 01:02:13.742
Wait...

01:02:13.775 --> 01:02:15.243
I thought you needed a job.

01:02:19.214 --> 01:02:20.549
Okay.

01:02:21.450 --> 01:02:25.088
Deacon, you can show
Nala where she's cleaning.

01:02:26.555 --> 01:02:28.223
Of course.

01:02:30.893 --> 01:02:31.894
Just come with me.

01:02:33.062 --> 01:02:35.098
Actually, I need
to take her with me.

01:02:35.130 --> 01:02:36.198
Don't you trust me?

01:02:37.733 --> 01:02:38.700
I changed my mind.

01:02:38.734 --> 01:02:39.701
It's okay, I-

01:02:39.735 --> 01:02:41.303
- Come with me!
- Get off me.

01:02:41.336 --> 01:02:42.738
- No.
- Give me my baby.

01:02:42.771 --> 01:02:44.007
Give me my baby!

01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:45.008
She'll be okay.

01:02:45.041 --> 01:02:46.009
Nandy, Nandy!

01:02:46.042 --> 01:02:47.010
Get off me.

01:02:47.043 --> 01:02:48.011
Come on!

01:02:48.044 --> 01:02:49.112
Give me back my baby!

01:02:55.584 --> 01:02:56.919
Ange?

01:03:05.128 --> 01:03:06.461
Angie?

01:03:10.933 --> 01:03:12.267
Angie?

01:03:20.509 --> 01:03:23.779
Hey, are you okay?

01:03:25.081 --> 01:03:28.151
I'm sorry sweetheart
but we have to go.

01:03:28.183 --> 01:03:29.351
We have an appointment.

01:03:31.353 --> 01:03:33.089
Can you meet me downstairs
in five minutes?

01:03:33.122 --> 01:03:34.957
Get dressed.

01:03:35.892 --> 01:03:37.359
We got you a new one of this.

01:03:39.594 --> 01:03:41.763
I'll leave it for
you here, okay?

01:03:43.498 --> 01:03:44.599
See you downstairs.

01:03:58.547 --> 01:03:59.681
Are you ready?

01:04:03.251 --> 01:04:04.753
Are you okay?

01:04:04.786 --> 01:04:06.722
Do you know that man?

01:04:27.176 --> 01:04:28.844
Hi, Angie.

01:04:29.244 --> 01:04:30.545
Remember me?

01:04:30.579 --> 01:04:32.581
How are you doing?

01:04:34.951 --> 01:04:36.585
Believe it or not,

01:04:36.618 --> 01:04:38.955
I do know what
you're going through.

01:04:38.988 --> 01:04:40.156
You have no idea.

01:04:43.291 --> 01:04:45.527
I've been there too.

01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:49.198
When I first got out I
felt this big disconnect.

01:04:49.232 --> 01:04:51.033
I wanted to escape so bad,

01:04:51.067 --> 01:04:54.436
when I did, I felt like
I didn't fit anywhere.

01:04:55.604 --> 01:04:57.173
I thought I'd done
something wrong,

01:04:57.206 --> 01:04:58.740
that it was my fault,

01:04:58.774 --> 01:05:00.442
that everyone was judging me.

01:05:01.443 --> 01:05:03.246
And I just hated myself.

01:05:06.949 --> 01:05:08.416
I made my sister cry.

01:05:11.319 --> 01:05:12.554
Where did you get this?

01:05:14.957 --> 01:05:17.927
I made these, I gave one to Zoe.

01:05:19.828 --> 01:05:23.665
Angie, this is Zoe.

01:05:24.833 --> 01:05:26.235
I just wanna know
that she's okay.

01:05:26.269 --> 01:05:28.271
Was she with you?

01:05:29.238 --> 01:05:30.572
Angie?

01:05:31.007 --> 01:05:32.141
Please Angie.

01:05:32.175 --> 01:05:33.142
Can we go?

01:05:33.176 --> 01:05:34.143
What happened?

01:05:34.177 --> 01:05:35.310
I'm so sorry.

01:05:37.779 --> 01:05:38.948
I'm Latisha.

01:05:40.482 --> 01:05:42.251
This is a good place.

01:05:42.285 --> 01:05:43.318
She can help you.

01:05:43.351 --> 01:05:45.821
Let's get you home, come on.

01:05:45.854 --> 01:05:47.355
Let's go inside.

01:05:49.292 --> 01:05:51.194
You have to come
with me, quick.

01:05:51.227 --> 01:05:52.261
Not without my baby.

01:05:52.295 --> 01:05:54.429
I'll get your baby back, okay?

01:05:54.462 --> 01:05:56.665
I'll contact you as
soon as I find her.

01:05:56.698 --> 01:05:58.567
Take this and don't lose it.

01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:00.269
Go, go, go!

01:06:01.971 --> 01:06:05.607
All my friends are like
talking about boys and stuff.

01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:10.645
My friend Skylar has a crush
on this guy named Alex,

01:06:11.513 --> 01:06:12.480
and I think he's disgusting.

01:06:12.514 --> 01:06:13.682
Hey.

01:06:13.715 --> 01:06:17.119
Angie, you need
to eat your food.

01:06:17.153 --> 01:06:18.486
Please.

01:06:34.103 --> 01:06:35.938
It's okay, I got it.

01:06:35.972 --> 01:06:37.639
I got it.

01:06:39.841 --> 01:06:41.210
What do you want from me?

01:06:42.644 --> 01:06:43.845
What?

01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:45.580
We just want you to
be okay, sweetheart.

01:06:46.581 --> 01:06:47.917
Okay?

01:06:49.352 --> 01:06:50.585
I don't even know what that is.

01:06:50.619 --> 01:06:52.355
I don't even know
who I am anymore.

01:06:52.387 --> 01:06:53.588
How can I be okay?

01:06:59.228 --> 01:07:00.196
She hates us.

01:07:00.229 --> 01:07:01.931
No, she doesn't hate us.

01:07:01.964 --> 01:07:03.431
Yes, she does.

01:07:03.465 --> 01:07:05.467
Your sister has just been
through a lot, that's all.

01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:07.103
Even though she acts
like she doesn't want us

01:07:07.136 --> 01:07:10.239
or she doesn't need
us, she still does.

01:07:10.273 --> 01:07:12.174
Just give her
a little time, okay?

01:07:12.208 --> 01:07:13.541
Okay.

01:07:43.272 --> 01:07:44.373
I hate you.

01:07:50.313 --> 01:07:52.114
She's so on edge.

01:07:52.148 --> 01:07:55.517
You can't say anything without
getting your head bitten off.

01:07:55.550 --> 01:07:57.686
We just have
to be there for her.

01:07:59.121 --> 01:08:02.457
Yeah, I just want her
to feel safe with us again.

01:08:02.490 --> 01:08:04.093
There was a man outside today.

01:08:06.761 --> 01:08:08.097
What?

01:08:09.065 --> 01:08:11.100
She looked like
she'd seen a ghost,

01:08:11.133 --> 01:08:12.634
then said she didn't know him.

01:08:14.170 --> 01:08:15.404
We should
let the police know.

01:08:15.438 --> 01:08:20.009
I'm sorry, no, I'm
just being paranoid.

01:09:06.488 --> 01:09:07.622
Hey.

01:09:07.654 --> 01:09:09.724
Rachel, perfect timing.

01:09:09.758 --> 01:09:11.993
Angie is wearing the
bracelet I made for Zoe.

01:09:12.962 --> 01:09:15.031
Can you to talk to her for me?

01:09:15.064 --> 01:09:17.966
Don't you think she'd be more
comfortable talking to you?

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.102
I pushed her too hard.

01:09:20.136 --> 01:09:21.370
Rachel.

01:09:21.404 --> 01:09:23.506
I know Angie can
give us something.

01:09:23.537 --> 01:09:25.174
I could see it in her face.

01:09:28.877 --> 01:09:30.379
I'm sorry.

01:09:31.479 --> 01:09:32.982
All right.

01:09:33.482 --> 01:09:34.450
Don't worry about it.

01:09:34.483 --> 01:09:36.152
I'll talk to her.

01:09:36.651 --> 01:09:38.487
What's your name?

01:09:40.389 --> 01:09:42.224
What's up?

01:09:43.125 --> 01:09:45.859
Highway patrol found
her up by the freeway.

01:09:45.895 --> 01:09:47.129
She's in shock.

01:09:49.165 --> 01:09:50.832
DCFS seen her yet?

01:09:50.865 --> 01:09:52.501
They're on their way.

01:09:52.535 --> 01:09:53.868
Good.

01:09:54.537 --> 01:09:57.839
In the meantime, let's
get her somewhere safe.

01:09:57.872 --> 01:09:59.375
Yeah.

01:09:59.408 --> 01:10:01.544
Do you have any
room at your place?

01:10:01.576 --> 01:10:03.179
Yeah, I can make room.

01:10:04.413 --> 01:10:05.747
Thanks.

01:10:14.622 --> 01:10:15.891
Hi.

01:10:15.925 --> 01:10:17.426
Good afternoon, Mrs. Morgan.

01:10:18.660 --> 01:10:19.761
How's Angie doing?

01:10:19.794 --> 01:10:20.996
Up and down, you know?

01:10:35.844 --> 01:10:37.580
I've got nothing
to say to you.

01:10:37.612 --> 01:10:39.115
I'm not your enemy, Angie.

01:10:39.148 --> 01:10:40.615
You let them get away.

01:10:40.648 --> 01:10:41.984
Ida says you work for them.

01:10:43.119 --> 01:10:45.121
Ida, okay.

01:10:50.459 --> 01:10:53.062
Good, thank you.

01:10:53.095 --> 01:10:54.563
We don't work with them.

01:10:54.597 --> 01:10:57.732
They tell you to make
you afraid to talk to us.

01:10:57.765 --> 01:11:00.102
We tried to get you
out at the hotel

01:11:00.136 --> 01:11:02.404
but they got you out
in a different vehicle.

01:11:02.438 --> 01:11:03.506
We screwed up.

01:11:04.373 --> 01:11:05.707
I'm sorry.

01:11:05.740 --> 01:11:07.977
We're on your side, Angie.

01:11:08.010 --> 01:11:11.247
We know the gang is running
other underage girls too.

01:11:12.381 --> 01:11:14.583
There was you and Zoe.

01:11:15.783 --> 01:11:17.453
Who else?

01:11:18.287 --> 01:11:21.689
Please Angie, anything
can tell me would help.

01:11:23.758 --> 01:11:25.227
Your dad told me

01:11:25.261 --> 01:11:28.330
that you saw someone outside
your house the other day.

01:11:28.364 --> 01:11:29.331
Angie.

01:11:29.365 --> 01:11:31.133
Angie, please tell him.

01:11:34.603 --> 01:11:38.773
Okay, there's Ida.

01:11:38.806 --> 01:11:39.874
Ida's the boss.

01:11:41.277 --> 01:11:44.779
And then there's somebody
that's running around

01:11:44.812 --> 01:11:46.882
taking care of
everything for her,

01:11:46.916 --> 01:11:48.050
probably this guy.

01:11:50.852 --> 01:11:53.721
I don't know his name
Angie, but you do.

01:11:55.823 --> 01:11:58.327
But I know you don't
wanna say anything to us

01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:00.095
because they threatened you.

01:12:01.230 --> 01:12:03.032
They threatened you
and your family, right?

01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:06.635
They do that to
keep you in fear.

01:12:06.669 --> 01:12:07.937
You're safe.

01:12:07.970 --> 01:12:10.606
You're at home and you're safe.

01:12:10.639 --> 01:12:14.243
We really need getting
those other girls out,

01:12:14.276 --> 01:12:15.544
and we could use your help.

01:12:15.578 --> 01:12:18.080
Get out, please just go.

01:12:18.113 --> 01:12:19.615
Just go, just get away!

01:12:19.648 --> 01:12:21.984
No, no, no, just go!

01:12:22.017 --> 01:12:23.686
- Just go!
- He's just trying to help.

01:12:23.718 --> 01:12:25.187
Just please get out.

01:12:25.221 --> 01:12:26.188
Go!

01:12:26.222 --> 01:12:27.189
Okay.

01:12:27.223 --> 01:12:28.790
Just go.

01:12:28.891 --> 01:12:30.092
I'm leaving.

01:12:30.125 --> 01:12:31.126
I'm leaving.

01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:33.662
When you're ready, I'm here.

01:12:47.276 --> 01:12:48.978
Oh, she's beautiful.

01:12:58.487 --> 01:12:59.455
Hello.

01:12:59.488 --> 01:13:00.623
Hey.

01:13:17.273 --> 01:13:20.042
She ain't spoken a word
since she got here, huh?

01:13:20.075 --> 01:13:22.044
No.

01:13:22.077 --> 01:13:23.778
Not yet.

01:13:23.811 --> 01:13:28.117
I was thinking, maybe I'll
talk, testify, whatever.

01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:34.523
Wow, that's brave.

01:13:35.758 --> 01:13:37.426
Are you sure?

01:13:39.728 --> 01:13:42.464
Okay, why now?

01:13:42.498 --> 01:13:44.433
I'm sick of all
the nightmares.

01:13:45.734 --> 01:13:47.436
Thinking they'll
come and find me.

01:13:48.870 --> 01:13:51.006
When they gave me this tattoo,
they said I was like a dog.

01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:52.141
They owned me.

01:13:52.174 --> 01:13:54.777
So, let the cops arrest them,

01:13:54.809 --> 01:13:56.779
and you testify.

01:13:56.811 --> 01:13:59.014
They will put you into
witness protection program

01:13:59.048 --> 01:14:00.316
in a different state,

01:14:00.349 --> 01:14:01.317
they will make you
change your name.

01:14:01.350 --> 01:14:02.418
No, no.

01:14:04.053 --> 01:14:05.321
I not changing my name.

01:14:06.255 --> 01:14:08.057
They took everything that I had.

01:14:09.525 --> 01:14:12.027
I mean it, Rachel, if they
want me to say something,

01:14:13.028 --> 01:14:14.530
I'm keeping my name.

01:14:14.563 --> 01:14:15.898
Okay.

01:14:16.864 --> 01:14:18.534
Okay, I'm so proud of you.

01:14:18.567 --> 01:14:20.402
Come here.

01:14:27.710 --> 01:14:29.445
I'm so proud of you.

Diva's planning on
talking to the cops.

01:16:27.095 --> 01:16:28.630
Nala told us.

01:16:28.664 --> 01:16:29.698
I'll handle it.

01:16:30.766 --> 01:16:32.434
Shut up!

01:16:33.202 --> 01:16:35.270
Angel's causing us problems.

01:16:36.171 --> 01:16:37.306
She needs a message.

01:16:37.339 --> 01:16:39.241
A clear one.

01:16:39.274 --> 01:16:41.109
Okay, I'll take care of it.

01:16:42.277 --> 01:16:44.112
And find a buyer
for this thing.

01:16:44.146 --> 01:16:45.848
It's beginning to annoy me.

01:16:47.483 --> 01:16:48.650
Stop crying.

01:16:50.887 --> 01:16:53.355
Actually, it's worse.

01:16:53.388 --> 01:16:55.757
She doesn't even know
who I am anymore.

01:16:57.493 --> 01:17:00.462
I just hate them all
so much right now.

01:17:00.496 --> 01:17:02.431
It's all right,
things will get better.

01:17:02.464 --> 01:17:03.432
I promise.

01:17:08.804 --> 01:17:10.974
Get your hands off of her!

01:17:11.006 --> 01:17:12.407
It's okay, this is
Luke, just my friend.

01:17:12.441 --> 01:17:14.743
They moved up across the street.

01:17:14.776 --> 01:17:16.411
You don't know
that, get inside.

01:17:16.445 --> 01:17:17.947
I'm gonna go now.

01:17:20.282 --> 01:17:21.617
Why would you do that?

01:17:21.650 --> 01:17:22.952
You were so rude!

01:17:22.986 --> 01:17:24.386
Why do you think he's
hanging out with you?

01:17:24.419 --> 01:17:26.890
Just because you were
stupid doesn't mean that I am!

01:17:26.923 --> 01:17:29.893
There is literally no
one more stupid than you.

01:17:43.238 --> 01:17:47.576
Okay, I'll be back to
pick you up in an hour.

01:17:47.609 --> 01:17:49.278
I love you.

01:17:59.989 --> 01:18:02.624
For those of you who are new,

01:18:02.658 --> 01:18:05.160
if you don't love
yourself right now,

01:18:05.193 --> 01:18:07.095
we're gonna love
you till you do.

01:18:07.129 --> 01:18:10.967
Here we share experience,
strength and hope

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.402
with each other here,
to help with recovery.

01:18:13.435 --> 01:18:16.705
What is shared
here, it stays here.

01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:20.208
Let's begin with
a prayer ladies.

01:18:24.446 --> 01:18:27.082
God, grant us the
serenity and the faith

01:18:27.115 --> 01:18:29.986
to put the past behind us,

01:18:30.019 --> 01:18:34.523
and to have the
courage to believe

01:18:34.556 --> 01:18:38.560
in the infinite
possibilities for the future.

01:18:40.029 --> 01:18:41.763
Okay, ladies, let's have a seat.

01:18:44.232 --> 01:18:48.303
All right, who would
like to share first?

01:18:48.337 --> 01:18:49.705
Anyone?

01:18:49.738 --> 01:18:51.807
Mariah, please.

01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:54.443
I met Joe online.

01:18:57.746 --> 01:18:59.448
I really thought he loved me.

01:19:00.716 --> 01:19:04.954
He talked me into coming
to meet him in Arizona.

01:19:04.988 --> 01:19:08.323
And at first,
everything was perfect.

01:19:08.357 --> 01:19:12.260
He gave me presents,
made me feel special.

01:19:12.294 --> 01:19:17.299
Then he would tell me that
if I didn't do what he asked

01:19:18.968 --> 01:19:20.602
me to do with those other men,

01:19:22.939 --> 01:19:24.606
that I didn't love him.

01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:26.675
So, I did whatever he asked

01:19:26.708 --> 01:19:29.578
even though it made
me sick to my stomach.

01:19:29.611 --> 01:19:32.048
I ran away once and I hid,

01:19:32.081 --> 01:19:36.085
and he tracked me down
and he beat me up.

01:19:36.119 --> 01:19:38.453
But at that time, I
had nowhere to go.

01:19:42.691 --> 01:19:43.825
He was all I had.

01:19:47.462 --> 01:19:48.664
After, you took me in.

01:19:52.300 --> 01:19:55.370
I had no family, but
then you found me,

01:19:57.639 --> 01:19:59.741
and you helped me to
get my faith back.

01:20:23.198 --> 01:20:24.199
How'd you get out?

01:20:29.404 --> 01:20:30.839
I was with the same gang too.

01:20:33.910 --> 01:20:36.344
It hurts now but it gets better.

01:20:43.218 --> 01:20:44.987
My friend Zoe and I
tried to get out together

01:20:45.021 --> 01:20:47.723
but they caught her.

01:20:49.892 --> 01:20:51.259
I wanna help her but...

01:20:51.293 --> 01:20:55.098
Hey, the fear's always
gonna live in here.

01:20:56.798 --> 01:20:58.935
They're still out there
doing what they do.

01:21:00.903 --> 01:21:02.071
You gotta deal with it
the way you deal with it,

01:21:02.105 --> 01:21:03.772
but I'm gonna talk.

01:21:06.274 --> 01:21:07.576
You'll find your strength.

01:21:08.744 --> 01:21:10.079
Okay?

01:21:19.721 --> 01:21:21.556
No, no!

01:21:22.691 --> 01:21:24.060
You're not that smart Diva.

01:21:24.093 --> 01:21:25.727
Help me.

01:21:28.530 --> 01:21:30.199
Help!

01:21:30.298 --> 01:21:31.399
Rachel, help!

01:21:33.268 --> 01:21:34.770
Rachel, help me.

01:21:36.505 --> 01:21:37.839
No!

01:21:39.909 --> 01:21:40.977
Latisha!

01:21:41.010 --> 01:21:42.277
No!

01:21:45.847 --> 01:21:46.983
No, oh my God.

01:21:52.554 --> 01:21:54.190
Hello, Mario.

01:21:54.924 --> 01:21:56.259
Hi.

01:21:58.293 --> 01:22:00.129
Too much sugar!

01:22:00.163 --> 01:22:02.165
It's bad for you,

01:22:02.497 --> 01:22:04.066
Nala's working out well.

01:22:05.034 --> 01:22:06.535
Diva's being dealt with today.

01:22:07.502 --> 01:22:08.837
I know.

01:22:09.504 --> 01:22:11.540
Should we need to be
worried about Angel?

01:22:12.607 --> 01:22:14.043
Why are you asking me?

01:22:14.076 --> 01:22:16.411
This entire shit-storm
is your fault.

01:22:17.980 --> 01:22:19.248
I like your mother.

01:22:19.282 --> 01:22:21.349
We had some good
times, she and I.

01:22:21.383 --> 01:22:23.385
Seems to me you have
a decision to make.

01:22:24.519 --> 01:22:26.822
You need to bring Angel home,

01:22:26.855 --> 01:22:30.259
or your mom and I are
no longer friends.

01:22:39.768 --> 01:22:41.603
Luckily the driver
was apprehended

01:22:41.636 --> 01:22:43.306
before anyone was injured.

01:22:43.338 --> 01:22:44.840
And earlier today,

01:22:44.873 --> 01:22:47.977
the charred remains of 16
year-old Latisha Jones,

01:22:48.010 --> 01:22:49.511
a former sex trafficking victim

01:22:49.544 --> 01:22:52.148
who was rescued from her
captors six months ago,

01:22:52.181 --> 01:22:54.884
were discovered in
North East of LA.

01:22:54.917 --> 01:22:57.153
No suspects have
been yet identified.

01:22:57.186 --> 01:22:58.254
They killed her.

01:23:03.358 --> 01:23:04.860
It's my fault.

01:23:04.894 --> 01:23:05.861
It's all my fault.

01:23:05.895 --> 01:23:06.862
No, it's not.

01:23:06.896 --> 01:23:07.863
Honey, what's wrong?

01:23:07.897 --> 01:23:09.531
It's all my fault.

01:23:24.046 --> 01:23:25.147
Angie?

01:23:26.015 --> 01:23:27.183
Rachel's here.

01:23:29.517 --> 01:23:32.520
Sweetheart, I think it might
really help you to talk to her.

01:23:33.521 --> 01:23:35.191
Leave me alone.

01:23:35.224 --> 01:23:37.226
I'm coming in.

01:23:48.536 --> 01:23:49.571
Can I join you?

01:23:59.081 --> 01:24:00.548
How are you doing?

01:24:03.852 --> 01:24:06.621
I have to show this to
my parents too, don't I?

01:24:06.655 --> 01:24:07.856
I've seen this before.

01:24:09.457 --> 01:24:13.129
They're trying to lure you back
by threatening your family.

01:24:13.162 --> 01:24:14.429
They know where I live.

01:24:15.664 --> 01:24:17.934
Chase and his team
will protect you.

01:24:17.967 --> 01:24:19.235
Like they did Latisha?

01:24:21.803 --> 01:24:24.773
We can't change
what happened her.

01:24:24.806 --> 01:24:25.807
Latisha was trying to stand up

01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:27.410
for herself and the other girls.

01:24:27.442 --> 01:24:30.779
When I got out, they
killed four girls

01:24:30.812 --> 01:24:33.349
before I even got the
courage to speak up.

01:24:36.385 --> 01:24:39.221
I carry that with me every day.

01:24:44.759 --> 01:24:46.429
Come here.

01:24:47.196 --> 01:24:48.797
It's gonna be okay.

01:24:50.032 --> 01:24:51.733
Everything is gonna be okay.

01:24:52.902 --> 01:24:55.438
I'm gonna be with you
through everything.

01:24:57.373 --> 01:25:00.076
We can't change
what they did to us.

01:25:00.109 --> 01:25:01.410
They stole our childhood,

01:25:02.510 --> 01:25:03.611
and we're not
gonna let them take

01:25:03.645 --> 01:25:05.547
one more second of your life.

01:25:05.580 --> 01:25:07.016
What life?

01:25:08.351 --> 01:25:09.718
I can't sleep,

01:25:11.153 --> 01:25:12.888
I'm too afraid to go outside,

01:25:12.922 --> 01:25:17.927
and everyone looks at me
like I'm broken and fragile.

01:25:19.128 --> 01:25:20.329
You gonna now want to
find have to find a way

01:25:20.363 --> 01:25:23.565
to forgive yourself,
to set yourself free.

01:25:23.598 --> 01:25:24.766
Whatever they did to your body

01:25:24.799 --> 01:25:27.036
does not change the
essence of who you are.

01:25:29.571 --> 01:25:31.240
Look here.

01:25:32.574 --> 01:25:34.542
I struggled for
a very long time.

01:25:37.413 --> 01:25:38.847
A very long time.

01:25:40.782 --> 01:25:43.986
And eventually I realized...

01:25:48.757 --> 01:25:51.726
I realized that
leaning into my faith

01:25:53.795 --> 01:25:57.066
and using my experience to help
other girls was everything.

01:25:57.099 --> 01:25:59.768
I wanna help, just that...

01:25:59.801 --> 01:26:01.103
It's okay.

01:26:01.137 --> 01:26:02.804
I understand.

01:26:02.837 --> 01:26:03.805
I do.

01:26:03.838 --> 01:26:05.307
You're not alone, Angie.

01:26:05.341 --> 01:26:07.176
We have to talk to the police.

01:26:11.213 --> 01:26:14.682
We'd like to take you all
to a safe house, immediately.

01:26:17.253 --> 01:26:20.322
Don't worry, Maddie is
gonna be fine with Warren.

01:26:20.356 --> 01:26:21.924
She's really good with kids.

01:26:21.957 --> 01:26:23.558
Thank you.

01:26:23.591 --> 01:26:25.227
I wanna help.

01:26:25.261 --> 01:26:27.829
No, Angie.

01:26:27.862 --> 01:26:29.165
It's dangerous.

01:26:29.198 --> 01:26:31.633
You know what happened
to that other girl.

01:26:31.666 --> 01:26:33.002
Agreed.

01:26:33.668 --> 01:26:35.137
We've been through
enough already.

01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:40.142
If I don't testify, I
will end up like Latisha.

01:26:42.411 --> 01:26:44.612
And who knows what
will happen to Maddie,

01:26:45.647 --> 01:26:46.815
and to you guys?

01:26:50.319 --> 01:26:53.089
As long as they're out
there we will never be safe!

01:26:53.122 --> 01:26:55.558
They have other
girls my age too.

01:26:57.426 --> 01:26:58.928
They named me Angel.

01:27:04.100 --> 01:27:08.137
I used to get raped sometimes
20 or 30 times everyday.

01:27:10.072 --> 01:27:12.841
Sometimes they would
beat me or burn me,

01:27:14.843 --> 01:27:16.545
just because it
would turn them on.

01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:20.583
They did unspeakable things.

01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:25.521
I wanna get them.

01:27:28.390 --> 01:27:29.391
Thank you.

01:27:34.796 --> 01:27:38.033
I failed you.

01:27:38.934 --> 01:27:39.902
Dad.

01:27:39.935 --> 01:27:41.504
Forgive me.

01:27:41.937 --> 01:27:43.272
It's not your fault.

01:27:52.314 --> 01:27:53.315
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:28:03.259 --> 01:28:06.794
Okay, are you ready Angie?

01:28:07.930 --> 01:28:09.265
Okay.

01:28:10.966 --> 01:28:13.235
Let's start with where
they were holding you.

01:28:15.770 --> 01:28:20.042
That motel, it's about
30 mins from where we were.

01:28:20.075 --> 01:28:23.678
I think we were in
an industrial area.

01:28:25.813 --> 01:28:30.052
And we were seeing
warehouses, big buildings.

01:28:34.557 --> 01:28:35.558
Is this the place?

01:28:53.576 --> 01:28:55.077
The guy that works for Ida,

01:28:56.445 --> 01:28:57.779
Deacon.

01:28:58.447 --> 01:28:59.714
Are you sure it's
gonna be all right?

01:28:59.747 --> 01:29:02.784
I mean are you sure
about everybody here

01:29:02.817 --> 01:29:04.553
and at the shelter?

01:29:04.587 --> 01:29:05.654
They texted me,

01:29:06.854 --> 01:29:08.324
so, they must have
gotten my number.

01:29:10.693 --> 01:29:12.895
We are going to keep you safe,

01:29:12.928 --> 01:29:14.396
We've got you a new phone.

01:29:14.430 --> 01:29:15.763
Okay?

01:29:16.665 --> 01:29:18.701
Okay, look at this.

01:29:18.733 --> 01:29:19.702
You see that?

01:29:19.734 --> 01:29:20.735
That's a tracker.

01:29:20.768 --> 01:29:23.973
Keep it on you at all times.

01:29:24.006 --> 01:29:26.308
And the phone will tell
us where you are too.

01:29:29.311 --> 01:29:31.981
Angie, the only people
with this number

01:29:32.014 --> 01:29:35.150
are your parents,
Rachel and myself.

01:29:37.620 --> 01:29:38.954
Thanks.

01:29:45.261 --> 01:29:46.362
We'll keep you here.

01:29:49.632 --> 01:29:51.766
The downstairs is that way,

01:29:51.799 --> 01:29:53.435
and your bedrooms
right this way.

01:30:01.410 --> 01:30:03.245
I'll take these.

01:30:05.981 --> 01:30:09.885
So, for how long are we
gonna have to hide here?

01:30:11.086 --> 01:30:12.755
I don't know.

01:30:14.590 --> 01:30:16.492
I'm sorry, Maddie.

01:30:16.525 --> 01:30:17.760
For everything.

01:30:19.595 --> 01:30:20.963
I'm sorry about the other day.

01:30:20.996 --> 01:30:22.698
I'm really scared, Ange.

01:30:26.935 --> 01:30:28.003
It's gonna be okay.

01:30:29.104 --> 01:30:30.773
I am too.

01:30:44.386 --> 01:30:47.122
Thanks for
the coffee, I needed it.

01:30:47.156 --> 01:30:48.624
Still got a lot of work to do.

01:30:51.794 --> 01:30:52.860
I just needed a pen.

01:30:54.296 --> 01:30:56.598
You said that I should
start doing a journal

01:30:56.632 --> 01:30:58.934
and I wanna write
my feelings down.

01:31:00.169 --> 01:31:01.637
Okay, I'm glad you
wanna do that, Nala,

01:31:01.670 --> 01:31:03.871
but you shouldn't be in here.

01:31:03.906 --> 01:31:06.542
If you need supplies, just
ask me next time, okay?

01:31:06.575 --> 01:31:07.910
Yeah.

01:31:28.230 --> 01:31:31.400
Hey, are you guys okay?

01:31:36.472 --> 01:31:37.573
I love you guys.

01:31:37.606 --> 01:31:38.873
- We love you-
- I know.

01:31:40.242 --> 01:31:41.844
I'm one of the lucky ones.

01:31:51.053 --> 01:31:52.755
Oh, leave it open.

01:31:53.822 --> 01:31:55.157
Okay.

01:31:55.891 --> 01:31:57.559
Good night.

01:32:53.148 --> 01:32:54.483
Chase!

01:32:55.050 --> 01:32:56.084
It's Angie!

01:32:56.118 --> 01:32:57.553
She's left the house.

01:32:57.586 --> 01:32:58.554
What?

01:32:58.587 --> 01:33:00.589
How far has she gone?

01:33:08.363 --> 01:33:09.731
She's not answering.

01:33:21.977 --> 01:33:23.278
Hello?

01:33:32.889 --> 01:33:34.122
Hello?

01:33:34.156 --> 01:33:36.792
Rachel,
they got to Angie.

01:33:37.793 --> 01:33:39.127
No.

01:33:40.062 --> 01:33:41.830
How did they contact her?

01:33:41.864 --> 01:33:43.432
Did anyone
else have her number?

01:33:43.465 --> 01:33:45.133
No, we were the only ones.

01:33:45.167 --> 01:33:46.301
Are you sure?

01:33:47.904 --> 01:33:49.238
Rachel?

01:33:50.974 --> 01:33:52.074
Oh my God.

01:33:52.107 --> 01:33:53.977
- What?
- Let me call you back.

01:33:54.009 --> 01:33:55.210
Wait a minute-

01:34:00.984 --> 01:34:02.317
- Nala!

01:34:03.018 --> 01:34:04.653
You gave them her
number, didn't you?

01:34:06.555 --> 01:34:08.223
They have my baby.

01:34:08.257 --> 01:34:09.625
I had no other choice.

01:34:09.658 --> 01:34:11.727
Nala, they have Angie.

01:34:11.760 --> 01:34:13.997
You know where they are,
you have to help me.

01:34:26.508 --> 01:34:27.509
I'm sorry.

01:34:35.717 --> 01:34:36.818
I'm so sorry.

01:34:49.364 --> 01:34:51.366
They're gonna kill me.

01:34:52.902 --> 01:34:54.636
You know that, don't you?

01:34:57.873 --> 01:34:59.241
I have no choice.

01:35:04.479 --> 01:35:05.982
I need your phone.

01:35:21.064 --> 01:35:22.731
Shoes off.

01:35:39.448 --> 01:35:42.551
Please, it's all we have.

01:35:43.385 --> 01:35:44.486
We can go away.

01:35:45.888 --> 01:35:47.522
Please.

01:35:47.556 --> 01:35:48.891
Get in.

01:35:50.927 --> 01:35:52.095
Get in the car.

01:36:07.876 --> 01:36:09.544
I got it.

01:36:20.089 --> 01:36:22.091
Thanks, Dan.

01:36:22.457 --> 01:36:23.425
They've got her.

01:36:23.458 --> 01:36:24.793
Let's go.

01:36:30.565 --> 01:36:31.767
I know where she is.

01:36:31.800 --> 01:36:33.903
She is at the warehouse
building, on Alemedia

01:36:33.936 --> 01:36:34.904
Okay.

01:36:34.937 --> 01:36:35.905
Alemedia and sixth.

01:36:35.938 --> 01:36:37.106
Got it.

01:36:54.723 --> 01:36:57.894
What did you tell
the police, Angel?

01:36:59.062 --> 01:37:00.262
What did you tell them?

01:37:00.295 --> 01:37:01.463
Take your time.

01:37:01.496 --> 01:37:02.731
It's important.

01:37:04.967 --> 01:37:06.334
I told them your names:

01:37:08.437 --> 01:37:11.140
Ida, Deacon,

01:37:13.910 --> 01:37:15.644
if that's what they even are.

01:37:15.677 --> 01:37:17.947
What else did you tell them?

01:37:17.980 --> 01:37:19.481
That's it.

01:37:20.749 --> 01:37:22.250
I promise.

01:37:22.284 --> 01:37:25.353
I didn't tell them anything
they didn't already know.

01:37:25.387 --> 01:37:27.856
I wish I could believe you.

01:37:29.025 --> 01:37:31.160
Let's play our favorite game.

01:37:33.062 --> 01:37:34.563
No, no, no, no!

01:37:34.596 --> 01:37:36.565
Look, she's already told
you everything, okay?

01:37:36.598 --> 01:37:38.567
She did, she's not stupid.

01:37:54.050 --> 01:37:55.417
I promise you, I promise.

01:37:55.450 --> 01:37:57.053
Nothing else, please.

01:37:58.286 --> 01:37:59.688
Let's try that again.

01:37:59.721 --> 01:38:04.659
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe,

01:38:05.527 --> 01:38:08.797
catch a rabbit by his toe.

01:38:08.830 --> 01:38:10.099
Goodbye.

01:38:17.839 --> 01:38:19.608
Get the girls,
get my car ready.

01:38:19.641 --> 01:38:21.276
I'll call Ivan, get us a plane.

01:38:21.309 --> 01:38:23.045
He'll be happy to know
we're delivering on Angel.

01:38:23.079 --> 01:38:24.046
Keep with her.

01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:25.248
What did you do?

01:38:25.280 --> 01:38:26.249
Get up!

01:38:26.281 --> 01:38:27.250
No!

01:38:27.282 --> 01:38:28.416
Get up, let's go!

01:38:28.450 --> 01:38:29.952
Come on.

01:38:30.418 --> 01:38:31.753
Don't leave
anything behind.

01:38:31.787 --> 01:38:33.022
I'll call Ivan.

01:38:33.055 --> 01:38:34.023
- Get out.
- Get her in the van

01:38:34.056 --> 01:38:35.024
with the girls.

01:38:35.057 --> 01:38:36.025
Get out!

01:38:36.058 --> 01:38:37.193
Go!

01:38:37.759 --> 01:38:39.095
Go!

01:38:42.031 --> 01:38:44.167
Move!

01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:47.203
Move!

01:38:57.479 --> 01:38:58.513
Freeze!

01:38:58.547 --> 01:38:59.581
The building is surrounded.

01:38:59.614 --> 01:39:00.582
Drop it!

01:39:00.615 --> 01:39:02.751
I will kill her.

01:39:02.784 --> 01:39:04.753
If she dies, you die.

01:39:13.562 --> 01:39:14.897
Angie, no!

01:39:15.363 --> 01:39:17.432
No, Angie,

01:39:17.465 --> 01:39:18.800
I've got her.

01:39:19.367 --> 01:39:20.335
Drop the gun.

01:39:20.368 --> 01:39:21.469
It's okay, Angie.

01:39:22.504 --> 01:39:23.906
Angie?

01:39:23.940 --> 01:39:26.441
Angie, don't do this.

01:39:28.443 --> 01:39:30.712
She's
worth more to us alive.

01:39:34.150 --> 01:39:35.650
Cuff her Liam.

01:39:44.459 --> 01:39:46.262
The others, please.

01:39:46.295 --> 01:39:47.429
- Don't worry,
- You have to get them.

01:39:47.462 --> 01:39:48.965
I'll find them.

01:39:58.140 --> 01:39:59.342
Show me your hands.

01:40:05.214 --> 01:40:06.481
Out of the car.

01:40:14.323 --> 01:40:15.824
Don't move.

01:40:19.328 --> 01:40:20.963
Zoe.

01:40:20.997 --> 01:40:22.497
Oh my God.

01:40:24.066 --> 01:40:26.801
Oh God.

01:40:33.842 --> 01:40:35.177
Angie.

01:40:59.235 --> 01:41:00.236
Where's my baby?

01:41:00.269 --> 01:41:02.704
I'm sorry, Nala.

01:41:02.737 --> 01:41:04.240
You said.

01:41:04.873 --> 01:41:06.042
You promised me!

01:41:06.075 --> 01:41:07.642
I know. They have
a lead on that.

01:41:07.676 --> 01:41:08.843
They think they sold her,

01:41:08.877 --> 01:41:09.912
but we're gonna
get her back, okay?

01:41:09.946 --> 01:41:11.013
- No!
- I promise-

01:41:11.047 --> 01:41:12.381
- You promised me already!

01:41:12.415 --> 01:41:13.382
I'm so sorry.

01:41:13.416 --> 01:41:15.284
Please, she's all I have!

01:41:21.589 --> 01:41:22.925
Angie?

01:41:23.926 --> 01:41:25.261
Angie.

01:41:25.727 --> 01:41:26.963
Thank God you're safe.

01:41:28.797 --> 01:41:29.899
Are you okay?

01:41:37.373 --> 01:41:39.041
What about them?

01:41:40.009 --> 01:41:41.410
They're still out there.

01:41:42.544 --> 01:41:43.611
Let's get you home, baby.

01:41:43.645 --> 01:41:44.981
Yeah.

01:42:35.781 --> 01:42:40.781
