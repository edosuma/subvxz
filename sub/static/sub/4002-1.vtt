24:58.458 --> 25:00.125
PRADO?

25:00.125 --> 25:02.583
AS IN "BABY BROTHER."

25:02.583 --> 25:05.250
(Dexter)
SO MUCH FOR SPONTANEITY.

25:05.250 --> 25:07.875
WHAT WAS HE DOING
IN A DUMP LIKE THIS?

25:07.875 --> 25:10.500
THEY'RE SAYING THAT HE WAS
A COACH AT A YOUTH CLUB.

25:10.500 --> 25:12.291
CAME HERE TO CONFRONT
THE SCUMBAG

25:12.291 --> 25:14.583
ABOUT SELLING SHIT
TO HIS KIDS.

25:14.583 --> 25:16.583
TALK ABOUT WRONG PLACE
AT THE WRONG TIME.

25:16.583 --> 25:19.458
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

25:25.834 --> 25:27.417
FIND ANYTHING?

25:27.417 --> 25:30.500
YEAH.

25:30.500 --> 25:32.291
DEAD GUY WITH
A HOLE IN HIS CHEST.

25:43.333 --> 25:44.959
HEY, THIS WINDOW'S CRACKED,

25:44.959 --> 25:46.417
AND THERE'S BLOOD
ON THE WALL.

25:46.417 --> 25:48.333
WHO SHUT THESE DRAPES?

25:48.333 --> 25:49.583
PROBABLY
THE FIRST ON SCENE.

25:49.583 --> 25:51.750
SOME DIPSHIT ROOKIE
WHO'S STILL OUTSIDE PUKING.

26:09.041 --> 26:10.583
SO WHAT DO WE GOT?

26:10.583 --> 26:14.166
UH, SIGNS OF
A MAJORLY BIG STRUGGLE HERE,

26:14.166 --> 26:15.542
THERE, EVERYWHERE.

26:15.542 --> 26:16.542
SINGLE STAB WOUND
TO THE CHEST.

26:16.542 --> 26:18.000
YOU READ MY ARTICLE YET?

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
STARTED IT.
SO FAR IT'S REALLY GOOD.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.041
AWESOME.

26:29.625 --> 26:30.709
GOD.

26:33.834 --> 26:35.709
[speaking Spanish]

26:40.333 --> 26:41.875
WHOEVER DID THIS,

26:41.875 --> 26:44.208
HE'S ALREADY
WISHING HE WAS DEAD.

26:51.667 --> 26:54.250
SOMEONE REALLY STEPPED
ON HIS DICK WITH THIS ONE.

27:06.875 --> 27:09.625
THERE WERE SO MANY LESSONS
IN THE VAUNTED CODE OF HARRY.

27:12.041 --> 27:14.500
TWISTED COMMANDMENTS
HANDED DOWN

27:14.500 --> 27:17.208
FROM THE ONLY GOD
I EVER WORSHIPPED.

27:17.208 --> 27:19.750
ONE THROUGH TEN,

27:19.750 --> 27:23.458
DON'T GET CAUGHT.

27:23.458 --> 27:27.000
THAT I GOT COVERED.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.375
BUT KILLING SOMEONE

27:28.375 --> 27:31.917
WITHOUT KNOWING
IF HE'S GUILTY,

27:31.917 --> 27:33.834
I'D LOVE SOME HELP
ON THIS ONE.

27:35.792 --> 27:39.583
BUT MY GOD IS DEAD NOW.

27:39.583 --> 27:41.667
[dog barking]

27:45.083 --> 27:47.083
(Batista)
MAN'S BEST FRIEND,

27:47.083 --> 27:48.625
EH, DEX?

27:48.625 --> 27:51.375
NOT TODAY.

27:51.375 --> 27:52.542
HEY, MY SISTER SAID

27:52.542 --> 27:54.875
THAT LAGUERTA KNOWS THIS
MIGUEL PRADO PRETTY WELL?

27:54.875 --> 27:57.917
WAY BACK WHEN,
WHEN MIG--

27:57.917 --> 28:00.083
HEY, WHAT'S UP?

28:00.083 --> 28:02.667
WAY BACK WHEN,
WHEN MIGUEL WAS IN LAW SCHOOL

28:02.667 --> 28:04.917
AND MARIA WAS JUST STARTING
IN LAW ENFORCEMENT,

28:04.917 --> 28:06.208
THEY HOOKED UP.

28:06.208 --> 28:07.917
HOOKED UP?

28:07.917 --> 28:10.583
BETWEEN US,
FOR MARIA,

28:10.583 --> 28:13.667
MIGUEL PRADO WILL ALWAYS
BE THE ONE THAT GOT AWAY.

28:20.125 --> 28:21.750
(Batista)
PRELIM HAS THE VICTIM,

28:21.750 --> 28:25.959
OSCAR PRADO, 26, DEAD.

28:25.959 --> 28:28.500
DEAD FROM A SINGLE
STAB WOUND TO THE CHEST.

28:28.500 --> 28:30.208
THE DECEASED'S BROTHER,
A.D.A. MIGUEL PRADO,

28:30.208 --> 28:32.875
INFORMED ME
AT THE SCENE

28:32.875 --> 28:35.583
THAT OSCAR WENT TO CONFRONT
ONE FRED BOWMAN,

28:35.583 --> 28:37.333
STREET NAME FREEBO,

28:37.333 --> 28:39.125
FOR SELLING DRUGS
TO SOME YOUTH CLUB KIDS.

28:39.125 --> 28:40.709
MORGAN.

28:40.709 --> 28:43.417
THIS FREEBO'S THE SAME GUY
THAT KILLED THOSE TWO COEDS

28:43.417 --> 28:45.375
IN THE EVERGLADES
AND GOT AWAY WITH IT.

28:45.375 --> 28:49.250
SO THE WAY IT LOOKS,
OSCAR PRADO DIED A HERO.

28:49.250 --> 28:50.834
ALSO, OUR TEAM FOUND
A SHIT LOAD OF, UH--

28:50.834 --> 28:53.166
A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT
OF DRUGS IN THE HOUSE.

28:53.166 --> 28:54.709
ANY LEADS ON HIS WHEREABOUTS?

28:54.709 --> 28:55.792
UH, THAT PART
OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD

28:55.792 --> 28:57.125
ISN'T EXACTLY
POLICE-FRIENDLY.

28:57.125 --> 28:58.709
BUT I'M STAYING ON IT.

28:58.709 --> 29:00.208
TALK TO ME ABOUT FORENSICS.

29:00.208 --> 29:03.625
UM, EVIDENCE INDICATES
THIS WAS NO HIT-AND-RUN.

29:03.625 --> 29:06.041
IT WAS A FURIOUS
CLOSE-IN BATTLE.

29:06.041 --> 29:07.208
WHOEVER--

29:07.208 --> 29:09.166
OR IS IT "WHOMEVER"?

29:09.166 --> 29:10.542
"WHOEVER" IS GOOD.

29:10.542 --> 29:12.750
WHOEVER DID THIS
GOT IN A LUCKY SHOT

29:12.750 --> 29:14.750
OR WAS REALLY GOOD
AT HANDLING A BLADE.

29:14.750 --> 29:15.917
ACCORDING TO THE M.E.,

29:15.917 --> 29:18.333
THE AORTA
WAS CLEANLY SEVERED

29:18.333 --> 29:19.917
IN ONE PENETRATION.

29:19.917 --> 29:21.583
NOT EASY TO DO.

29:21.583 --> 29:22.792
ANY LUCK FINDING THE WEAPON?

29:22.792 --> 29:23.834
IT'S NOT ON OR NEAR
THE PREMISES.

29:23.834 --> 29:25.166
WE'VE CHECKED
ROOFS, SEWERS,

29:25.166 --> 29:27.583
TRASH BINS
IN A FIVE-BLOCK RADIUS.

29:27.583 --> 29:29.000
OUR CONCLUSION,

29:29.000 --> 29:30.834
THE ASSAILANT
TOOK IT WITH HIM.

29:30.834 --> 29:32.750
DEXTER, WHAT'S
THE BLOOD SAYING?

29:32.750 --> 29:35.417
PRETTY MUCH
WHAT EVERYONE ELSE IS.

29:35.417 --> 29:37.291
I HAVE SOME SECOND LEVEL
ON-SCENE WORK TO DO.

29:37.291 --> 29:38.500
I'LL GET BACK TO YOU
A.S.A.P.

29:38.500 --> 29:40.291
GET IT TO SERGEANT BATISTA.

29:40.291 --> 29:42.583
FULL DISCLOSURE.

29:42.583 --> 29:44.333
I'VE HAD
A PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP

29:44.333 --> 29:46.542
WITH THE PRADO FAMILY
FOR MANY YEARS.

29:46.542 --> 29:49.500
AND IT GOES A LOT FURTHER
THAN THE WHOLE CUBANO THING.

29:49.500 --> 29:53.542
SERGEANT?

29:53.542 --> 29:55.458
STATING THE OBVIOUS,
LIEUTENANT,

29:55.458 --> 29:57.417
I LIKE FREEBO FOR THIS.

29:57.417 --> 29:59.625
(Dexter)
ME TOO.

29:59.625 --> 30:01.000
(LaGuerta)
MORGAN.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.667
(Debra)
YES, MA'AM?

30:02.667 --> 30:04.417
HIT THE STREETS HARDER.

30:04.417 --> 30:06.125
LEARN WHAT YOU CAN LEARN.

30:06.125 --> 30:09.834
(Quinn)
ALL DUE RESPECT,
LIEUTENANT,

30:09.834 --> 30:11.667
IF FREEBO DID THIS,
HE'S NOT IN MIAMI.

30:11.667 --> 30:12.959
I MEAN, HE'S IN THE WIND.

30:12.959 --> 30:15.458
WE CAN SIT AROUND
ON OUR ASSES AND SPECULATE

30:15.458 --> 30:17.750
ON WHERE WE THINK
THE PRIME SUSPECT

30:17.750 --> 30:18.959
MAY OR MAY NOT BE,

30:18.959 --> 30:21.417
OR WE CAN ACTUALLY
GO AND LOOK FOR HIM.

30:23.917 --> 30:25.417
AS A MIAMI PROSECUTOR,

30:25.417 --> 30:29.250
I HAVE DEDICATED MY CAREER
TO FIGHTING CRIME,

30:29.250 --> 30:33.583
TO MAKING OUR STREETS SAFE
FOR EVERYONE.

30:33.583 --> 30:37.208
EVERY FAMILY,
WHITE, BLACK, LATINO, ASIAN,

30:37.208 --> 30:41.333
DESERVES THE FULL MEASURE
OF OUR DEVOTION

30:41.333 --> 30:44.208
TO THEIR DIGNITY.

30:44.208 --> 30:47.834
AND NOW THAT CRIME
HAS TOUCHED MY FAMILY

30:47.834 --> 30:50.667
IN THE MOST PROFOUND WAY
IMAGINABLE,

30:50.667 --> 30:53.333
I GRIEVE EQUALLY
FOR EVERY FAMILY

30:53.333 --> 30:56.667
THAT HAVE BEEN VISITED
WITH THE SAME

30:56.667 --> 30:59.458
UNIMAGINABLE NEWS
THAT WE HAVE RECEIVED TODAY.

30:59.458 --> 31:02.875
OUR BEAUTIFUL CITY
IS A CITY OF FAMILIES.

31:02.875 --> 31:08.333
AND THE UNTIMELY TAKING
OF ANY OF US

31:08.333 --> 31:10.667
TOUCHES ALL OF US.

31:10.667 --> 31:14.333
MY PARENTS BROUGHT
MY BROTHER RAMON AND ME--

31:14.333 --> 31:15.959
(Dexter)
PART OF MY RITUAL

31:15.959 --> 31:17.917
HAS ALWAYS BEEN
GETTING TO KNOW MY VICTIMS,

31:17.917 --> 31:21.458
CONFIRMING THEIR GUILT
BEYOND ALL DOUBT.

31:21.458 --> 31:25.792
OSCAR PRADO TRIED
TO KILL FREEBO.

31:25.792 --> 31:27.208
THEN HE TRIED
TO KILL ME.

31:27.208 --> 31:28.959
NO WAY HE WAS THERE ON SOME
NOBLE YOUTH CLUB MISSION.

31:28.959 --> 31:31.083
HE'S GOT TO BE GUILTY
OF SOMETHING.

31:31.083 --> 31:33.375
AREN'T WE ALL?

31:33.375 --> 31:35.750
SO I ASK AGAIN...

31:35.750 --> 31:38.333
WHO ARE YOU?

31:46.458 --> 31:49.917
TWO SPEEDING TICKETS
AND AN ILLEGAL U-TURN.

31:52.959 --> 31:55.000
TALK ABOUT OUTSIDE
THE CODE OF HARRY.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.959
[sighs]

31:56.959 --> 31:59.083
HARRY FINDS ME
IN A POOL OF BLOOD,

31:59.083 --> 32:01.750
TURNS ME INTO HIS OWN
PERSONAL VENDETTA MACHINE,

32:01.750 --> 32:03.959
AND WHEN HE SEES
THE MONSTER HE CREATED

32:03.959 --> 32:05.667
IN ACTION,

32:05.667 --> 32:07.750
HE KILLS HIMSELF.

32:07.750 --> 32:10.375
DEB CAN DRINK TO HIS HONOR
ON HER OWN.

32:10.375 --> 32:13.000
ANY LUCK IN THE LAND
OF RELUCTANT WITNESSES?

32:13.000 --> 32:14.667
ONE HOUSE I PLAY GOOD COP.

32:14.667 --> 32:16.250
THE NEXT HOUSE
I PLAY BAD COP.

32:16.250 --> 32:18.542
I STILL CAN'T GET SHIT FROM
ANYBODY IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD.

32:18.542 --> 32:20.417
YOU KNOW WHAT
THE PROBLEM IS, RIGHT?

32:20.417 --> 32:22.125
WAIT, QUINN,
LET ME GUESS.

32:22.125 --> 32:23.417
THE "COP" PART?

32:23.417 --> 32:25.375
NO, THEY DON'T
OWE YOU ANYTHING.

32:25.375 --> 32:27.625
THERE'S NO INCENTIVE,
WHICH SKEWS THE BALANCE OF POWER

32:27.625 --> 32:30.417
WAY IN THEIR DIRECTION,
RIGHT?

32:30.417 --> 32:33.333
HERE, LET ME DO YOU
A FAVOR.

32:33.333 --> 32:35.417
CALL THIS GUY.

32:35.417 --> 32:37.250
TELL HIM YOU KNOW ME.

32:37.250 --> 32:40.166
TELL HIM YOU WANT TO CASH IN
ONE OF MY COUPONS.

32:40.166 --> 32:41.959
COUPONS?
YEAH.

32:41.959 --> 32:44.291
HE'S A C.I.
FROM MY DAYS IN NARCOTICS.

32:44.291 --> 32:47.125
HE'S GOT A HOOK IN HIM THAT'S
NOT COMING OUT ANYTIME SOON.

32:47.125 --> 32:50.041
WHAT DO YOU WANT
IN RETURN?

32:50.041 --> 32:52.125
FOR YOU TO REMEMBER
THAT I DID YOU A SOLID.

32:54.417 --> 32:55.959
WHAT, NOT EVEN
A "THANK YOU"?

32:55.959 --> 32:57.542
THANK YOU.

33:28.834 --> 33:30.458

33:32.750 --> 33:34.041

33:34.041 --> 33:36.250
YOU LET WALK
ON THOSE COED KILLINGS?

33:36.250 --> 33:39.500
NOW THAT THERE WAS
A FINE PIECE OF POLICE WORK.

33:39.500 --> 33:42.083
YOU KNEW HIM
FROM THE NEWSPAPER?

33:42.083 --> 33:43.750

OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

33:43.750 --> 33:45.625

FOR THAT TEMPER
I GOT A MAN DOWN THE STREET

CAN TAKE THAT EDGE RIGHT OFF.

33:58.041 --> 33:59.667

YOU KNOW IT NEVER HURTS
AN OCCASIONAL DRUG USER

34:24.583 --> 34:26.709
TO HAVE MORE THAN ONE
FRIEND ON THE FORCE, SO...

34:26.709 --> 34:28.041
THAT'S THE THING,
OFFICER.

34:28.041 --> 34:30.625
I GOT ENOUGH FRIENDS.

34:30.625 --> 34:32.500

35:31.583 --> 35:34.250
LAB COAT.

35:34.250 --> 35:35.500
A GUN?

35:35.500 --> 35:37.041
NO.

35:37.041 --> 35:38.792
HE'S GOT A BADGE.

35:38.792 --> 35:41.875
LAMINATE.

35:41.875 --> 35:43.291
WELL, THANK U SO MUCH

35:43.291 --> 35:45.291
FROM TAKING TIME
FROM YOUR BUSY SCHEDULE,

35:45.291 --> 35:48.625
MR. MORGAN, TO COME
AND TALK TO THE CHILDREN.

35:48.625 --> 35:53.083
IT WAS
A REAL LEARNING EXPERIENCE.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.083
LOOKS LIKE I REALLY
GOT THROUGH TO THEM, HUH?

35:59.083 --> 36:00.875
IT WOULD HAVE
SUCKED EVEN WORSE

36:00.875 --> 36:02.625
IF I DIDN'T HAVE
A DAD TODAY.

36:04.709 --> 36:07.333
THANKS FOR INVITING ME,
BUDDY.

36:14.792 --> 36:17.125
(Dexter)
IF ANYONE
SHOULD HAVE FATHER ISSUES,

36:17.125 --> 36:19.333
ANGER, REJECTION,
ABANDONMENT,

36:19.333 --> 36:20.834
IT'S CODY.

36:20.834 --> 36:22.417
AND WHAT'S HE DO?

36:22.417 --> 36:24.000
HE MOVES ON.

36:26.375 --> 36:28.458
HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN?

36:35.625 --> 36:37.291
I WAS SO BAD
YOU'RE CRYING?

36:37.291 --> 36:39.083
NO, NO.

36:39.083 --> 36:40.959
NO, IT'S JUST--

36:40.959 --> 36:42.500
JUST SOMETHING
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED.

36:42.500 --> 36:45.542
YOU BEING HERE
FOR THE KIDS,

36:45.542 --> 36:48.625
IT'S ALL SO WONDERFULLY
UNCOMPLICATED.

36:50.792 --> 36:52.667
[cell phone rings]

36:56.083 --> 36:57.583
HELLO.

36:57.583 --> 36:59.750
MR. MORGAN,
THIS IS MIGUEL PRADO.

36:59.750 --> 37:01.041
I NEED TO SEE YOU.

37:01.041 --> 37:03.208
RIGHT AWAY.

37:08.917 --> 37:11.667
SO MUCH FOR UNCOMPLICATED.

37:30.208 --> 37:33.500
IT ALMOST FEELS
LIKE A PIECE OF ART.

37:33.500 --> 37:36.083
THANK YOU, SIR.

37:36.083 --> 37:38.542
BUT TO ME
IT'S MORE LIKE A STORY.

37:40.834 --> 37:42.542
TELL ME THAT STORY,
MR. MORGAN.

37:48.083 --> 37:50.250
THE ENCOUNTER
STARTED OVER HERE.

37:50.250 --> 37:51.291
MMM.

37:51.291 --> 37:53.041
THE SCUFF MARKS
ON THE LINOLEUM,

37:53.041 --> 37:55.500
THE CRUMPLING,
OF THE THROW RUG,

37:55.500 --> 37:57.417
THEY ALL HAVE
A DIRECTIONAL QUALITY

37:57.417 --> 37:59.083
THAT LEADS TO--

37:59.083 --> 38:02.125
NOW THIS IS WHERE
YOUR BROTHER

38:02.125 --> 38:03.542
AND FREEBO--

38:03.542 --> 38:05.959
HE'S MY LIEUTENANT'S
PRIME SUSPECT--

38:08.208 --> 38:11.125
BUT YOU KNOW THAT.

38:11.125 --> 38:14.000
THERE WAS
A BRUTAL STRUGGLE.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.125
I GOTTA SAY

38:16.125 --> 38:17.917
IT LOOKS LIKE
YOUR BROTHER

38:17.917 --> 38:21.041
FOUGHT LIKE A HERO.

38:21.041 --> 38:22.709
BUT HE WAS OVERMATCHED

38:22.709 --> 38:26.750
AND SUSTAINED A FATAL
STAB WOUND TO HIS CHEST.

38:29.417 --> 38:31.750
EVERYTHING ABOUT THE BLOOD
SUGGESTS THAT YOUR BROTHER

38:31.750 --> 38:34.458
BLED OUT ALMOST INSTANTLY.

38:34.458 --> 38:35.792
HE DIDN'T SUFFER?

38:35.792 --> 38:38.083
BLOOD NEVER LIES.

38:40.750 --> 38:44.875
SO NOW I KNOW
HOW HE DIED.

38:44.875 --> 38:47.625
THE QUESTION IS WHY.

38:47.625 --> 38:50.542
ONE MORE THING,
MR. MORGAN.

38:50.542 --> 38:54.792
WHY WOULD
A BLOOD SPATTER ANALYST

38:54.792 --> 38:56.083
SPEND TIME SEARCHING

38:56.083 --> 38:58.000
THE SHERIFF DEPARTMENT'S
DATABASE

38:58.000 --> 39:00.625
FOR INFORMATION
ON MY DEAD BROTHER?

39:02.709 --> 39:05.333
UM...

39:08.333 --> 39:10.208
LIKE YOU, SIR,
I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND

39:10.208 --> 39:11.750
WHAT HAPPENED HERE.

39:11.750 --> 39:13.375
I THOUGHT THAT

39:13.375 --> 39:16.500
KNOWING SOME DETAILS
ABOUT YOUR BROTHER'S LIFE

39:16.500 --> 39:19.208
WOULD HELP ME MAKE SENSE
OUT OF HIS DEATH.

39:19.208 --> 39:21.166
IN YOUR LINE OF WORK,
MR. MORGAN,

39:21.166 --> 39:23.417
IS IT USUAL FOR YOU

39:23.417 --> 39:25.125
TO GET SO INVOLVED?

39:28.917 --> 39:31.875
I JUST SOUNDED LIKE
A PROSECUTOR THERE.

39:31.875 --> 39:33.917
I'M SORRY.

39:33.917 --> 39:35.750
IT'S NOT A PROBLEM, SIR.

39:35.750 --> 39:37.834
AND NO, IT'S NOT USUAL
FOR ME TO GET SO INVOLVED,

39:37.834 --> 39:40.667
BUT THIS ONE,
THIS DEATH,

39:40.667 --> 39:41.834
GOT TO ME.

39:45.583 --> 39:46.750
IT'S JUST--

39:46.750 --> 39:51.500
IT SEEMS SO UNREAL
THAT, UH,

39:51.500 --> 39:54.000
HE'S GONE.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.834
YEAH, I KNOW.

39:58.125 --> 40:00.208
SO A MAN DIES,
MR. MORGAN,

40:00.208 --> 40:02.667
AND WHAT'S LEFT,
HIS SOUL?

40:02.667 --> 40:05.000
AND WHAT IS THAT
EXACTLY?

40:05.000 --> 40:07.917
I REALLY COULDN'T TELL YOU.

40:07.917 --> 40:09.041
'CAUSE SOME PEOPLE SAY

40:09.041 --> 40:10.250
THE SOUL JUST LIVES ON
FOREVER.

40:13.208 --> 40:15.125
I HOPE NOT.

40:15.125 --> 40:17.792
WHICH MAKES YOU
A CYNIC.

40:17.792 --> 40:20.709
IT MAKES ME A SCIENTIST.

40:23.000 --> 40:26.250
SO NO ONE YOU'VE
EVER LOVED

40:26.250 --> 40:27.792
HAS DIED?

40:29.875 --> 40:32.792
MY FATHER DIED
WHEN I WAS IN MY 20s.

40:32.792 --> 40:36.417
AND YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT--

40:36.417 --> 40:39.750
THAT HIS SOUL,

40:39.750 --> 40:41.875
CALL IT HIS LIFE FORCE,
IS STILL HERE?

40:41.875 --> 40:44.083
SOMEHOW IT'S LIVING
INSIDE YOU?

40:47.917 --> 40:52.000
BECAUSE I--

40:52.000 --> 40:55.000
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE
FOR HIM.

40:55.000 --> 40:56.500
YOU CAN'T BLAME YOURSELF,
SIR.

40:56.500 --> 40:59.291
THAT'S EASIER SAID
THAN DONE, MR. MORGAN.

41:05.792 --> 41:07.583
DO ME A FAVOR.

41:07.583 --> 41:10.208
YOU REALLY WANT TO GET TO KNOW
MY BROTHER LIKE YOU SAY,

41:10.208 --> 41:11.875
COME TO HIS WAKE TONIGHT.

41:11.875 --> 41:14.125
COME SEE HOW MUCH
AND HOW--

41:14.125 --> 41:17.583
HOW FULLY
HE WAS LOVED.

41:17.583 --> 41:19.375
OKAY.

41:19.375 --> 41:22.250
I'VE TAKEN UP
ENOUGH OF YOUR DAY.

41:22.250 --> 41:25.166
THANK YOU.

41:25.166 --> 41:27.417
DEXTER.

41:36.125 --> 41:38.125
THESE REPORTS FINAL?

41:38.125 --> 41:40.208
BLOOD SPECIMENS I COLLECTED
ALL CAME BACK

41:40.208 --> 41:41.750
BELONGING TO OSCAR PRADO.

41:41.750 --> 41:43.500
TRACE PRINTS
ON AND AROUND THE VICTIM

41:43.500 --> 41:45.291
ALL POINT TO FREEBO.

41:45.291 --> 41:46.834
ANYONE OUT THERE TALKING?

41:46.834 --> 41:49.291
WELL, OFFICER MORGAN WAS
HITTING UP THE USUAL FIREWALL

41:49.291 --> 41:51.750
OF CLAMMED-UP WITNESS
AND NON-WITNESSES,

41:51.750 --> 41:54.166
SO I PUT HER IN TOUCH
WITH AN OLD C.I. OF MINE.

41:54.166 --> 41:56.166
HOPEFULLY--
HEY, QUINN.

41:56.166 --> 41:58.959
THAT C.I. YOU PUT ME ON
WAS TOTALLY USELESS FOR FREEBO.

41:58.959 --> 42:00.959
SADLY, IT'S NOT
A PERFECT WORLD.

42:00.959 --> 42:04.000
YEAH, FOR ALL WE KNOW FREEBO'S
IN, LIKE, NEBRASKA BY NOW.

42:04.000 --> 42:07.125
WELL, I GUESS YOU DON'T
OWE ME THAT FAVOR THEN.

42:07.125 --> 42:07.917
HOW COME HE GETS FAVORS?

42:07.917 --> 42:09.250
OH, HE DOESN'T.

42:09.250 --> 42:11.500
BUT WHAT THE C.I.
TOLD ME ABOUT THE VICTIM.

42:11.500 --> 42:13.667
HE WASN'T SOME HERO COACH
WHO WENT INTO THE HOOD

42:13.667 --> 42:15.166
AND TOOK ONE
FOR THE TEAM.

42:15.166 --> 42:16.208
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

42:16.208 --> 42:20.000
OSCAR PRADO WAS INTO FREEBO
FOR SOME SERIOUS CASH.

42:20.000 --> 42:21.166
NOW WHY WOULD SOMEONE
BE INTO,

42:21.166 --> 42:22.709
I DON'T KNOW, A DRUG DEALER,
FOR BIG BUCKS?

42:22.709 --> 42:24.834
SHH. SHH.

42:24.834 --> 42:26.875
BECAUSE OSCAR PRADO,
THE PRIDE OF LITTLE HAVANA,

42:26.875 --> 42:28.333
WAS A FUCKING JUNKIE.

42:32.875 --> 42:34.709
THANKS, MARIA.

42:37.875 --> 42:39.667
GOOD ONE, MORGAN.

42:56.875 --> 42:59.834
SHE'S BEEN
IN BETTER MOODS.

42:59.834 --> 43:02.083
YEAH, I DIDN'T EXACTLY
BRIGHTEN HER DAY.

43:02.083 --> 43:03.542
NO, YOU DIDN'T.

43:03.542 --> 43:05.875
EXCUSE ME FOR DOING
MY FUCKING JOB.

43:05.875 --> 43:07.542
YOU SEE
ANY OTHER SUPER COPS

43:07.542 --> 43:09.583
COMING IN HERE
WITH ANY LEADS?

43:09.583 --> 43:11.667
NO, DEB, YOU'RE
DEFINITELY AMAZING,

43:11.667 --> 43:12.792
BUT YOU GOTTA--

43:12.792 --> 43:14.792
YEAH, I KNOW,
I KNOW, I KNOW.

43:14.792 --> 43:16.667
BE AWARE OF MY SURROUNDINGS,
TAKE THE TEMPERATURE

43:16.667 --> 43:18.250
OF THE ROOM
BEFORE I OPEN MY MOUTH.

43:18.250 --> 43:20.250
I KNOW, IT'S A BAD HABIT.
I ADMIT IT.

43:20.250 --> 43:21.917
WELL, LOOK ON
THE BRIGHT SIDE.

43:21.917 --> 43:23.917
NOW THAT YOU'VE GIVEN UP
MEN, BOOZE, AND CIGARETTES,

43:23.917 --> 43:26.208
RUNNING YOUR MOUTH'S THE ONLY
BAD HABIT YOU HAVE LEFT.

43:26.208 --> 43:28.500
THAT'S RIGHT.

43:28.500 --> 43:31.083
I'M A MODEL
OF FUCKING PERFECTION.

43:33.417 --> 43:35.959
YOU REMEMBER WHAT TODAY IS,
RIGHT?

43:35.959 --> 43:37.709
HOW COULD I FORGET?

43:37.709 --> 43:40.375
7:30.
I'LL BUY YOUR FIRST DRINK.

43:47.083 --> 43:48.125
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME?

43:48.125 --> 43:49.625
SIENTATE.

43:52.125 --> 43:53.792
I NEED YOU
TO THINK ABOUT

43:53.792 --> 43:56.208
DEBRA MORGAN'S
CONTINUED INVOLVEMENT

43:56.208 --> 43:57.750
ON THE OSCAR PRADO CASE.

44:00.291 --> 44:02.291
YOU WANT ME TO THROW HER
UNDER THE BUS FOR WHAT,

44:02.291 --> 44:03.542
BEING A LITTLE
OVERZEALOUS?

44:03.542 --> 44:04.834
IT'S NOT ABOUT ZEAL.

44:04.834 --> 44:07.500
IT'S ABOUT TACT
AND SENSITIVITY.

44:07.500 --> 44:08.959
IT'S ALSO
ABOUT THE REAL WORLD.

44:08.959 --> 44:10.709
THIS CASE IS
AS HIGH PROFILE AS IT GETS.

44:10.709 --> 44:12.458
óIGAME, ANGEL.

44:12.458 --> 44:15.792
MORGAN IS RESOURCEFUL
AND TENACIOUS,

44:15.792 --> 44:17.792
AND USUALLY THE RIGHT AMOUNT
OF PAIN-IN-THE-ASS.

44:17.792 --> 44:20.250
BUT THERE ARE
POLITICAL RAMIFICATIONS.

44:20.250 --> 44:22.417
MY HISTORY WITH
MIGUEL PRADO ASIDE,

44:22.417 --> 44:23.792
THIS CASE IS JUST
TOO BIG FOR HER.

44:25.792 --> 44:27.917
JUST SAY THE WORD, MARIA,
AND I WILL FOLLOW YOUR ORDERS.

44:27.917 --> 44:29.458
BECOMING A HOMICIDE SERGEANT

44:29.458 --> 44:31.500
IS MORE THAN JUST
A BUMP IN PAY SCALE.

44:31.500 --> 44:34.542
IT'S A QUANTUM LEAP
IN RESPONSIBILITY.

44:34.542 --> 44:37.583
ALL PART
OF MOVING UP THE CHAIN.

44:37.583 --> 44:40.750
IF I BOUNCE HER,
SHE'LL HATE ME.

44:40.750 --> 44:43.667
YOU'RE HER BOSS, ANGEL,
NOT HER FRIEND.

44:46.083 --> 44:48.333
IT'S UP TO YOU.

44:51.458 --> 44:53.333
[overlapping conversations]

45:18.291 --> 45:19.834
HE TOUCHED MANY PEOPLE,
MANY HEARTS.

45:26.291 --> 45:28.166
[speaking Spanish]

45:33.208 --> 45:34.667
CAN I GET ANOTHER
CRANBERRY JUICE?

45:34.667 --> 45:37.208
THAT MAKES THREE.
PROBLEMS DOWN UNDER?

45:37.208 --> 45:40.375
JEEZ, I LIKE
THE FUCKING TASTE, OKAY?

45:46.125 --> 45:48.166
MISS YOU, DAD.

45:57.583 --> 45:58.583
MY CONDOLENCES.

45:58.583 --> 46:00.709
THANK YOU FOR COMING.

46:02.917 --> 46:04.750
LOSING MY BROTHER,
IT'S GOING TO LEAVE

46:04.750 --> 46:06.917
A PAIN IN MY HEART
THAT I DON'T THINK

46:06.917 --> 46:10.417
IS EVER GOING TO HEAL.

46:10.417 --> 46:12.625
YOU HAVE A BROTHER,
DEXTER?

46:18.583 --> 46:20.041
[cell phone vibrates]

46:23.417 --> 46:25.583
NO, JUST THE ONE
LOUD SISTER.

46:25.583 --> 46:28.083
WHAT SHE SAID
BACK AT THE STATION,

46:28.083 --> 46:29.917
IT'S OKAY.

46:29.917 --> 46:32.583
I KNOW MY BROTHER
WAS A GOOD MAN.

46:32.583 --> 46:34.542
BUT I CAN'T SAY
THAT HE SUFFERED

46:34.542 --> 46:36.917
FROM THE TRAGEDY
OF PERFECTION.

46:39.208 --> 46:41.625
WHO DOES?

46:41.625 --> 46:44.041
WHO INDEED?

46:44.041 --> 46:45.917
HEY, BROTHER.
THE MAYOR'S HERE.

46:56.834 --> 46:58.542
(Dexter)
YOU ATTACKED ME WITH A KNIFE

46:58.542 --> 46:59.834
IN A DOPE DEALER'S HOUSE.

46:59.834 --> 47:01.834
NO, OSCAR, YOU CERTAINLY
DID NOT SUFFER

47:01.834 --> 47:05.208
FROM THE TRAGEDY
OF PERFECTION.

47:05.208 --> 47:07.792
THEN WHY DOES THIS
FEEL SO WRONG?

47:07.792 --> 47:09.625
WHY IN YOUR DEATH

47:09.625 --> 47:14.125
ARE YOU STILL SO ALIVE
IN MY LIFE?

47:14.125 --> 47:17.333
DID YOU KNOW HIM WELL?

47:17.333 --> 47:20.709
NOT AS WELL AS I THOUGHT.

47:20.709 --> 47:21.834
SORRY.

47:42.083 --> 47:43.959
[cell phone vibrates]

48:02.333 --> 48:04.667
CUERVO BLACK.

48:07.375 --> 48:09.083
THANKS.

48:15.041 --> 48:17.375
HARRY.

48:25.792 --> 48:27.375
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

48:27.375 --> 48:28.792
CRANBERRY JUICE.

48:28.792 --> 48:30.500
IS THAT GONNA BE
A PROBLEM?

48:30.500 --> 48:32.166
NOT EVEN CLOSE
TO A PROBLEM.

48:32.166 --> 48:34.542
BUT THE TASTE,
KIND OF FUNKY.

48:34.542 --> 48:36.000
[chuckles]

48:41.166 --> 48:43.166
YOU KNOW, BY THE TIME
MY DAD WAS MY AGE,

48:43.166 --> 48:44.709
HE ALREADY HAD
HIS SHIELD.

48:46.583 --> 48:50.458
KINDA WHY I'M HERE.

48:50.458 --> 48:52.959
I'M TAKING YOU OFF
THE OSCAR PRADO CASE.

49:02.583 --> 49:05.375
I COME UP WITH GRADE-A INTEL
ON OSCAR PRADO,

49:05.375 --> 49:06.792
AND I'M GETTING TOSSED
OFF THE CASE

49:06.792 --> 49:08.166
FOR BEING A LITTLE LOUD?

49:08.166 --> 49:10.917
IN A NUTSHELL.

49:10.917 --> 49:13.250
LAGUERTA PUT YOU
UP TO THIS?

49:13.250 --> 49:15.250
IT WAS MY DECISION.

49:23.875 --> 49:26.959
