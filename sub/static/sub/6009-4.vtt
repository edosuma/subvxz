00:48.602 --> 00:50.937
Mary, the men are arranging
the concert now

00:50.979 --> 00:53.148
and they are so anxious
for us both to be in it,

00:53.190 --> 00:55.650
or there'll be no girls at all.
Please say you will.

00:55.687 --> 00:57.736
Do I have to? Yes, you do.

00:57.778 --> 01:01.865
Keeping their spirits up is an important
part of the cure and so very little to ask.

01:01.907 --> 01:04.742
What's going on?
The men are putting on a concert.

01:04.785 --> 01:07.037
Can I help?
Edith has it under control.

01:07.079 --> 01:12.376
I do, if Mary's willing. Oh, all
right. One song, and that's your lot.

01:13.251 --> 01:17.297
What time is Doctor Clarkson's
round? It's already happened.

01:18.298 --> 01:20.806
Without me? Why?
I'm not very late.

01:20.842 --> 01:24.554
We didn't see the need to wait. Mrs
Hughes, I need to steal you for a minute.

01:24.596 --> 01:27.599
I have to check the linen books.
But I went over them last week.

01:27.641 --> 01:30.977
Very good, m'lady. I'll get started.
Surely I can...

01:31.019 --> 01:35.357
Anna, can you tell Mrs Patmore it'll be easier
for me to go through the menus this afternoon?

01:35.399 --> 01:37.484
Of course, Your Ladyship.

01:37.526 --> 01:41.154
Cousin Cora - Please, can it wait?
I've a mountain to get through.

01:45.575 --> 01:47.744
There's a parcel for you.
Thank you.

01:52.332 --> 01:54.459
There's a little one for you.

01:54.793 --> 01:57.546
This one looks as if it's been
opened, but it hasn't.

02:02.884 --> 02:04.970
Ethel, have you nothing to do?

02:07.889 --> 02:12.019
I was keeping her talking.
You mustn't blame her. I don't.

02:20.694 --> 02:22.779
What a lovely day!

02:23.113 --> 02:27.284
Are you quite sure about Lavinia?
She wasn't Sir Richard's mistress.

02:27.868 --> 02:31.705
She gave him the evidence to settle
a debt of... someone she loved.

02:32.080 --> 02:34.291
And this is your beau, is it?

02:34.332 --> 02:37.836
A man who lends money, then uses it
to blackmail the recipient?

02:37.878 --> 02:41.923
He lives in a tough world.
And will you be joining him there?

02:42.799 --> 02:46.887
Richard Carlisle is powerful.
He's rich and getting richer.

02:47.679 --> 02:50.849
He wants to buy a proper house,
you know - with an estate.

02:51.391 --> 02:56.355
He says, after the war, the market will
be flooded and we can take our pick. Oh?

02:56.396 --> 02:59.775
And you can dance on the grave
of a fallen family.

03:00.692 --> 03:02.861
They will fall, lots of them.

03:02.903 --> 03:06.114
Some won't rise again,
but I don't intend to be among them.

03:06.782 --> 03:11.536
That leaves Matthew.
That's done now, Granny. Finished.

03:11.578 --> 03:13.705
It's time to move forward.

03:14.539 --> 03:18.168
What about Sybil?
Does she have anyone in her sights?

03:18.210 --> 03:24.800
Not that I know of. Are you sure
she has no chap in mind? How odd!

03:26.051 --> 03:30.972
I had an endless series of crushes
at her age. I don't think so.

03:31.473 --> 03:35.310
Not even some man she doesn't care
to mention? What do you mean?

03:36.228 --> 03:39.272
Well, war breaks down barriers

03:39.314 --> 03:41.858
and when peacetime re-erects them,

03:41.900 --> 03:46.947
it's... very easy to find oneself
on the wrong side. Really, Granny!

03:46.988 --> 03:50.784
How can you say that I'm too worldly
but Sybil's not worldly enough?

03:51.243 --> 03:54.996
You cannot be so contrary.
I'm a woman, Mary.

03:55.038 --> 03:57.124
I can be as contrary as I choose.

03:58.208 --> 04:03.255
But I don't understand. The patients are
always served their luncheon at 12:30.

04:03.296 --> 04:07.592
Well, today they'll be served at one.
Is this something I can help with?

04:07.634 --> 04:12.139
Mrs Patmore seems to be disobeying my
instructions and I can't get to the reason why.

04:12.180 --> 04:14.266
If you mean the patients' new
lunchtime,

04:14.307 --> 04:17.810
Her Ladyship felt it made the staff
luncheon unreasonably early.

04:17.853 --> 04:22.149
She moved it, so they could eat at noon. But
that will interfere with the nurses' shifts.

04:22.190 --> 04:25.277
Oh no, she's altered those, too.
Has she, indeed?

04:26.653 --> 04:28.739
Well, we'll see about that.

04:32.325 --> 04:34.411
It was always a question of when.

04:38.749 --> 04:42.377
May I have a word? Can it
wait? No, it cannot wait.

04:44.713 --> 04:46.887
I've just come from downstairs,

04:46.923 --> 04:50.260
where I learnt that my timetable
has been wantonly disregarded.

04:50.302 --> 04:52.387
If you mean the new lunchtime,

04:52.429 --> 04:58.310
the wretched servants were having to eat at 11
and then starve until their tea at six, so I...

04:58.352 --> 05:02.064
You've also torn up the nurses'
timetable. I haven't torn up anything...

05:02.105 --> 05:04.947
It would be foolish to accuse you
of being unprofessional,

05:04.983 --> 05:08.236
as you've never had a profession
in your life. Now, just a minute!

05:08.273 --> 05:11.323
You may think you have the right
to ordain the universe,

05:11.365 --> 05:15.327
but in this field - No, not in this field.
In this house, yes, I do have the right,

05:15.369 --> 05:18.372
given me by Doctor Clarkson
and by the law of the land!

05:18.413 --> 05:21.833
This is my house, and I am in charge
right alongside you!

05:21.875 --> 05:25.670
If you would stop your bullying.
That's enough! I will not listen to this.

05:25.712 --> 05:31.051
If I am not appreciated here, I will seek some
other place where I will make a difference. Good.

05:32.052 --> 05:37.849
I mean it. I cannot operate where
I am not valued. You must see that!

05:37.891 --> 05:39.976
Certainly.

05:42.437 --> 05:44.523
I shall go. I will.

05:45.691 --> 05:47.776
Perhaps it would be best.

05:49.111 --> 05:51.363
I repeat - I mean it.

05:52.364 --> 05:54.449
I'm sure you do - and so do I.

05:58.787 --> 06:02.499
Why did you promise Carson
not to stage any more protests,

06:02.541 --> 06:05.961
when you wouldn't promise me?
I had my reasons.

06:07.212 --> 06:10.382
But you won't be content to stay
at Downton forever, will you?

06:10.424 --> 06:14.052
Tinkering away at an engine
instead of fighting for freedom?

06:14.678 --> 06:17.889
I thought you'd join the rising
in Dublin last Easter.

06:18.181 --> 06:22.519
I might have... if it hadn't been put
down in six short, bloody weeks.

06:23.228 --> 06:27.691
But don't fret. The real fight for Ireland will
come after the war, and I'll be ready for it.

06:35.240 --> 06:40.203
The truth is, I'll stay in Downton
until you want to run away with me.

06:41.455 --> 06:44.666
Don't be ridiculous.
You're too scared to admit it...

06:45.625 --> 06:47.711
but you're in love with me.

06:48.503 --> 06:51.965
Branson, could you take me
into Ripon at three?

06:52.132 --> 06:55.135
I'm getting some things for Mama.
Is there anything you want?

06:55.177 --> 06:57.262
Nothing you can find in Ripon!

07:03.894 --> 07:08.690
Well... it IS her house. Does that mean
she's suddenly received a medical training?

07:08.732 --> 07:13.028
No - Or are you like everyone else in
thinking that, because she's a countess,

07:13.070 --> 07:16.615
she has acquired universal knowledge
by divine intervention?

07:16.656 --> 07:20.243
Mrs Crawley, convalescent homes
are not about medical training.

07:21.036 --> 07:24.664
They are far more to do with good
food, fresh air and clean sheets.

07:26.541 --> 07:30.128
Very well. I've had a letter
from a cousin in Paris

07:30.170 --> 07:33.215
who is working for the Wounded
And Missing Enquiry Department.

07:33.256 --> 07:37.469
They've opened a branch in Northern
France under the aegis of the Red Cross.

07:38.220 --> 07:42.224
I shall offer them my services.
Well, that's... that's very drastic.

07:42.265 --> 07:44.601
I have to go where I am useful

07:44.643 --> 07:47.896
and that place, I'm afraid,
is no longer Downton Abbey.

07:48.647 --> 07:50.941
You'll be missed.
By you, possibly.

07:52.984 --> 07:55.070
I hope so, anyway.

07:56.196 --> 07:58.281
But not, I think, by Lady Grantham.

07:59.157 --> 08:05.664
If you were the only girl
in the world.

08:06.081 --> 08:11.837
And I were the only boy

08:12.295 --> 08:15.340
I wish we had a man.

08:15.382 --> 08:18.051
Amen!
It would sound so much richer,

08:18.510 --> 08:20.804
but all the volunteers
are spoken for.

08:21.555 --> 08:23.890
How's it going?
All right, I suppose,

08:23.932 --> 08:27.144
if you don't mind singers who can't
sing and actors who can't act!

08:27.185 --> 08:32.190
It helps to keep their spirits up. So
they say, although I can't think why.

08:32.441 --> 08:36.361
I had a letter this morning
from Sir Richard Carlisle. Oh?

08:37.571 --> 08:39.655
He...

08:41.033 --> 08:43.994
He tells me he proposed
when he was staying here.

08:44.619 --> 08:48.498
He apologizes for not asking my
permission, but he's asking it now.

08:49.875 --> 08:52.294
Have you decided?
Is that why he's written?

08:52.335 --> 08:54.796
No... but I have made the decision.

08:54.838 --> 08:57.716
Which is?
I think I should take him.

08:59.509 --> 09:02.929
Do you really, my darling? I wish
I could believe in your motives.

09:02.971 --> 09:06.058
Why? What were your motives
when you married Mama?

09:07.184 --> 09:09.269
Your mother has made me very happy.

09:10.520 --> 09:12.939
Perhaps Sir Richard
will make ME very happy.

09:12.981 --> 09:17.069
What about Matthew?
Not you, too! Poor Matthew...

09:17.611 --> 09:20.572
What must he do to persuade you
he's in love with Lavinia?

09:20.614 --> 09:23.158
Open his chest and carve her name
on his heart?

09:25.952 --> 09:29.998
Write to him. Tell him of your plans
with Carlisle. You owe him that.

09:30.040 --> 09:32.793
I don't think I "owe" him anything,

09:32.834 --> 09:34.920
but I'll write to him, if you like.

09:39.007 --> 09:41.134
I'll try to send you an address,

09:41.176 --> 09:44.346
but you can always get me through
the Red Cross. Very good, ma'am.

09:44.471 --> 09:47.849
I'll try to contact Captain Crawley,
explain to him what's happened.

09:47.886 --> 09:51.517
If he does get leave, he'll probably
come to me or stay in London,

09:51.553 --> 09:55.112
but if I miss him and he turns up
here, I know you'll look after him.

09:55.148 --> 10:00.237
Of course I will, ma'am. Cook him what
he likes - not what's good for him.

10:00.278 --> 10:04.991
You don't know when you'll be back? I
don't think one knows anything in wartime.

10:07.202 --> 10:11.665
I'll try to give you warning. In
the meantime, look after yourselves.

10:12.833 --> 10:14.918
Now, I mustn't miss my train.

10:33.020 --> 10:35.105
So, what now?

10:42.029 --> 10:45.782
Ah, Anna said you were honoring us
with your presence at dinner.

10:45.824 --> 10:47.909
It's easier here than the hospital.

10:48.076 --> 10:51.413
I can always get changed back
into my uniform if I need to.

10:52.956 --> 10:57.002
What were you talking to Branson
about when I came into the yard?

10:58.253 --> 11:00.338
Nothing.

11:01.089 --> 11:03.175
Then why were you there?

11:03.300 --> 11:06.553
Why were YOU there?
Because I was ordering the motor.

11:07.346 --> 11:09.890
That is why one talks to chauffeurs,
isn't it?

11:09.931 --> 11:12.017
To plan journeys by road?

11:13.268 --> 11:16.605
He is a person.
He can discuss other things.

11:17.064 --> 11:21.151
I'm sure he can - but not with you.
What do you want from me?

11:21.193 --> 11:25.364
Am I to see if Sir Richard Carlisle has a
younger brother - one even richer than he is?

11:25.405 --> 11:28.200
Darling, what's the matter with you?
I'm on your side.

11:28.241 --> 11:30.327
Then be on my side!

11:32.371 --> 11:36.208
'So there we have it. I look
forward to introducing the two of you

11:36.244 --> 11:38.423
just as soon as you are next
at home,

11:38.460 --> 11:41.400
which naturally
I trust will be very soon indeed.

11:41.437 --> 11:44.341
Please be glad for me,
as I will always be for you.

11:44.377 --> 11:47.010
Your affectionate cousin, Mary. '

11:47.719 --> 11:52.808
We don't need anyone with us. The Sergeant knows
what we're doing. But what are we patrolling for?

11:52.844 --> 11:56.269
You've been taking those logic pills
again! This is the army, Mason.

11:56.306 --> 11:59.415
We're going on a patrol
because we're going on a patrol.

11:59.452 --> 12:02.489
Has Mary set a date yet
for the wedding? She doesn't say.

12:02.526 --> 12:06.034
I think she's hoping the war will be
over soon and they can set a date then.

12:06.071 --> 12:09.788
She could've waited and told you when she
saw you. She doesn't know I'm due back.

12:09.825 --> 12:14.246
Did you warn Daisy, or will it be a surprise? No,
I've told her we're coming to Downton first.

12:14.282 --> 12:17.171
Then I'll visit my dad and go back
to see her for a day at the end.

12:17.207 --> 12:22.462
Fresh Yorkshire air, followed by London
and Miss Swire. All right for some, sir!

12:23.296 --> 12:26.383
You'd never swap, though, would you?
No, I'd never swap.

12:27.926 --> 12:31.972
Bates in a pub? I can't see that.
I think your pal's mistaken.

12:32.008 --> 12:35.517
He met him here twice
before the war. Listen.

12:36.435 --> 12:41.189
I said to him, "Hello, Mr Bates," and he
walked off and wouldn't serve me after.

12:42.607 --> 12:47.404
Next thing you know, we'll have Anna running across
the county and dragging him back by his stick!

12:47.440 --> 12:49.620
I'm surprised he isn't here of his
own accord,

12:49.656 --> 12:52.826
with His Lordship having no valet
since the loony went.

12:52.862 --> 12:56.246
Don't speak ill of Mr Lang.
You're a funny one!

12:56.913 --> 12:58.999
Talk about sweet and sour.

12:59.750 --> 13:01.835
Better get back.

13:15.057 --> 13:17.142
Want a cup?

13:18.143 --> 13:20.228
Not really.

13:21.063 --> 13:24.232
What were you doing?
Oh, let me see.

13:25.650 --> 13:28.242
I've tidied the study - twice

13:28.278 --> 13:31.031
and I've rearranged the coats
in the hall.

13:31.948 --> 13:35.369
I might check his clothes for moth.
What about you?

13:36.119 --> 13:38.585
We've cleaned everything
three times over

13:38.622 --> 13:41.625
and I've sent Beth into the village
for some eggs to pickle,

13:41.661 --> 13:43.924
though the Mistress
doesn't really like them.

13:43.960 --> 13:47.089
Well, she never eats properly,
anyway. Not on her own.

13:47.506 --> 13:50.092
A butler can't do much
with supper on a tray!

13:52.302 --> 13:55.639
Beg your pardon for troubling you,
only the door was open.

13:55.675 --> 13:58.392
But the front gate was not. No.

13:59.643 --> 14:03.209
What do you want?
Have you got any spare food?

14:03.245 --> 14:06.775
"Spare food"?
What's that, when it's at home?

14:10.696 --> 14:12.781
Hang on, hang on. Wait.

14:17.953 --> 14:20.127
From around here? Not far.

14:20.163 --> 14:23.583
I used to work on the farms,
but er... not any more.

14:25.377 --> 14:30.465
Did you get that in the war? Don't
pity me. I'm one of the lucky ones.

14:34.386 --> 14:36.471
I might have something for you.

14:37.764 --> 14:39.850
Come on.

15:45.499 --> 15:48.210
Hello, Mr Molesley.
They told me you were up here.

15:49.711 --> 15:53.595
I hope you don't mind my bothering
you. Not a bit. What can I do for you?

15:53.632 --> 15:58.261
Well, actually, Mr Carson, I've been thinking
there might be something I can do for YOU. Hm?

15:58.887 --> 16:00.972
That brushing, for instance.

16:05.310 --> 16:08.021
I don't like having nothing to do,

16:09.064 --> 16:13.860
what with Captain Crawley away at the war
and his mother in France alongside him.

16:14.069 --> 16:18.615
And then, His Lordship's without a valet
and... and your plate is piled so high!

16:19.032 --> 16:21.118
I am quite occupied, it's true.

16:21.284 --> 16:23.870
So I thought I'd look in
and give you a hand,

16:25.080 --> 16:28.625
brushing, mending, cleaning shoes -
whatever's needed.

16:29.126 --> 16:31.466
That's kind of you, Mr Molesley.

16:31.503 --> 16:37.676
We shall have to watch ourselves, or else His
Lordship will want to pinch you off Captain Crawley.

16:44.224 --> 16:48.066
But he said he'd be here by now and he's
not. You mustn't worry about him, Daisy.

16:48.103 --> 16:52.733
I'm not "worried" like that, exactly, but this is William.
I think we should all be worried.

16:52.769 --> 16:55.824
Anything might have happened.
Maybe his leave was canceled.

16:55.861 --> 17:00.032
At times like these, people vanish and
turn up again in the strangest places.

17:00.068 --> 17:02.117
Like Mr Bates in that pub.

17:04.911 --> 17:09.165
Working in a public house? That's what
he said. I thought they'd have told you.

17:09.202 --> 17:12.294
It doesn't seem likely
that a trained valet like Mr Bates

17:12.329 --> 17:15.176
would be content to work
in a public house!

17:15.213 --> 17:18.717
Well, that's what he said.
Have you mentioned this to Anna?

17:19.217 --> 17:22.643
I haven't said anything to anyone.
I thought you all knew.

17:22.679 --> 17:27.684
Perhaps you should ask Thomas. Oh, I will ask Thomas.
Don't you worry about that, my girl.

17:28.352 --> 17:32.820
Didn't it occur to you that we might be
interested to hear it? Not particularly.

17:32.856 --> 17:37.736
As far as I knew, Mr Bates had left your employment.
You didn't think to tell Carson?

17:37.986 --> 17:41.114
I am not under Mr Carson's command
now, Your Lordship.

17:48.872 --> 17:52.376
Shoo! Daisy, go to bed
before you strain your eyes!

17:59.800 --> 18:03.512
Thank you, Daisy, for telling Mr
Carson all about my private letter!

18:03.548 --> 18:06.723
I didn't know it was a secret.
Sorry if I was wrong.

18:06.760 --> 18:08.809
There's no "if" about it.

18:11.353 --> 18:13.438
Why answer His Lordship at all?

18:14.481 --> 18:17.567
What did you want me to do?
Tell him to get knotted?

18:18.235 --> 18:21.446
He doesn't pay your wages.
I see.

18:21.738 --> 18:24.825
Well, I won't put you down
for a career in diplomacy, then!

18:24.861 --> 18:27.786
What's he after? To get Bates back?

18:29.079 --> 18:32.833
If Mr Bates wanted his job back,
he'd have written for it himself.

18:33.375 --> 18:36.545
Why would he want his job back?
He's like you. He got away.

18:36.920 --> 18:40.387
He's not very like me, thank you.
But you're both free

18:40.424 --> 18:44.010
of all the bowing and scraping
and "Yes, m'lord," and "No, m'lord."

18:44.047 --> 18:46.805
I envy him. I envy you.

18:47.848 --> 18:51.393
Cos I'm ready for a new adventure
and I don't care who hears me.

18:52.352 --> 18:55.897
"Be careful what you wish for."

19:13.415 --> 19:17.961
'The truth is, I'll stay in Downton
until you want to run away with me. '

19:26.511 --> 19:29.514
Ah. Good morning, Anna.
You sent for me, m'lord?

19:29.551 --> 19:31.600
I did. Come in.

19:32.642 --> 19:36.021
I have something to tell you,
but I hope I'm right.

19:36.688 --> 19:39.399
Carson didn't want you
to be troubled with it.

19:39.941 --> 19:42.444
Is this about Mr Bates, m'lord?
Yes, it is.

19:43.612 --> 19:48.158
I have no wish to upset you, but it seems he may
be back in Yorkshire working in a public house.

19:48.194 --> 19:50.082
We don't yet know where.

19:50.118 --> 19:52.204
The Red Lion in Kirby Moorside.

19:53.955 --> 19:56.041
Oh.

19:58.710 --> 20:02.089
You've seen him, then?
I have, yes, m'lord.

20:03.757 --> 20:05.842
And he's well? He is.

20:08.136 --> 20:10.847
He's not been back to Downton
for two reasons.

20:12.265 --> 20:17.145
He's hoping to settle certain matters
first... with Mrs Bates.

20:18.230 --> 20:21.066
And does he think he can?
He believes so, m'lord.

20:21.525 --> 20:23.610
Very good.

20:24.319 --> 20:27.030
And what is his second reason
for avoiding us?

20:27.531 --> 20:30.367
He says he parted with Your Lordship
on bad terms.

20:31.785 --> 20:35.080
He felt it might be embarrassing.
Yeah...

20:35.116 --> 20:37.165
It is for me to feel embarrassed.

20:40.001 --> 20:44.256
I had to get out of that kitchen, if
I'm not to be found dead under the table!

20:44.292 --> 20:47.222
It's like cooking a banquet
three times a day.

20:47.259 --> 20:50.470
It is a lot of extra work, whatever
they say - even with the helpers.

20:50.507 --> 20:52.556
Don't think they lighten the load!

20:55.308 --> 20:57.774
Mrs Bird? What's going on?

20:57.811 --> 21:02.733
I knew I'd be found out,
sooner or later. At least it's you.

21:03.900 --> 21:07.154
Found out doing what?
What does it look like?

21:07.779 --> 21:12.284
I don't know what it looks like,
except some kind of soup kitchen.

21:12.951 --> 21:15.037
You'd better come inside.

21:18.206 --> 21:20.292
One at a time.

21:20.667 --> 21:22.674
Now, take a piece of bread.

21:22.711 --> 21:26.173
Right. Daisy, stand there.
Give them a bowl and a spoon.

21:27.924 --> 21:30.010
When did all this start?

21:30.635 --> 21:33.263
That fella turned up asking for food.

21:33.764 --> 21:36.683
Then he came back next day
with a friend, and here we are.

21:36.720 --> 21:39.519
What does Mrs Crawley say?
She doesn't know yet.

21:39.728 --> 21:43.440
I suppose she'll put a stop to it when
she gets back from France. I hope not.

21:43.476 --> 21:47.441
To be honest, Mrs Patmore, I'm not
sure I can manage much longer.

21:47.477 --> 21:51.406
How often do you do it? I planned
to get it down to once a week

21:51.443 --> 21:53.372
and give them only the cheapest cuts,

21:53.408 --> 21:56.953
but it is my money, and I don't know
how much - Now, hold it right there!

21:56.990 --> 21:59.711
If we can't feed a few soldiers in
our own village,

21:59.748 --> 22:04.378
them that have taken a bullet or worse for
king and country, then I don't know what!

22:06.380 --> 22:09.883
Sorry about this, m'lady, only
there's no footman to do it now.

22:10.467 --> 22:13.845
I don't mind, but you'd better run
before Mrs Hughes sees you.

22:15.639 --> 22:20.686
M'lady... could I ask something?

22:21.520 --> 22:25.816
Only William, who was in service
here - I know William.

22:26.733 --> 22:29.319
Well, he's missing.

22:30.487 --> 22:34.262
That is, he was supposed to be back
on leave but he never turned up.

22:34.298 --> 22:38.036
He wrote he was coming home for a few
days with Captain Crawley...

22:38.370 --> 22:41.456
Is William your beau?
I won't say that, no, m'lady.

22:42.124 --> 22:45.669
We're all very fond of William
downstairs. Of course you are.

22:47.254 --> 22:50.841
Well, I'm sure it's nothing, but
I'll see what I can find out.

22:51.341 --> 22:53.427
Thank you.

23:00.434 --> 23:04.312
How do you know they didn't change
their plans? Well, of course I don't,

23:04.349 --> 23:06.690
but the poor girl
seemed quite certain.

23:07.149 --> 23:11.241
Just when Isobel's away and none of
us know where she is. Typical!

23:11.278 --> 23:16.700
I suppose Matthew might have heard from Cousin
Isobel and decided to meet up in France, instead.

23:16.992 --> 23:19.995
But that wouldn't explain
why William isn't here.

23:22.039 --> 23:24.124
I'll do what I can.

23:27.294 --> 23:30.088
No, don't stop stirring,
the bottom will burn!

23:31.214 --> 23:33.300
You can leave those to Daisy.

23:34.009 --> 23:37.471
That's it, Daisy. Put them
in the special storage area.

23:40.015 --> 23:43.206
What do you want?
Can I borrow some baking soda?

23:43.242 --> 23:46.396
"Borrow"? Why?
Are you planning to give it back?

23:52.277 --> 23:57.178
I might go over to Malton tomorrow. Agatha
Spenlow is madly promoting her charity fair.

23:57.214 --> 24:02.079
Do you need the motor? I'm afraid I do. Can
you get Pratt to take you in the other car?

24:02.115 --> 24:04.670
It doesn't matter.
I can go on Monday. But why?

24:04.706 --> 24:08.627
I'm told Bates is working
at a public house in Kirby Moorside.

24:08.663 --> 24:10.717
I want to investigate.

24:10.754 --> 24:14.216
I can't decide which part of that
speech is the most extraordinary!

24:14.252 --> 24:17.761
Why can't someone else go?
Because I want to go myself.

24:20.597 --> 24:22.683
So, Sybil, what are you up to, dear?

24:23.392 --> 24:27.646
Nothing much. Working. I don't have
time to get up to anything else.

24:28.146 --> 24:31.400
Only Mary and I were talking
about you the other day.

24:32.192 --> 24:33.991
Oh?

24:34.027 --> 24:36.160
Yes, you see, sometimes, in war,

24:36.196 --> 24:39.825
one can make friendships
that aren't quite... appropriate

24:40.450 --> 24:42.786
and it can be awkward, you know,
later on.

24:42.994 --> 24:46.998
I mean, we've all done it. I just
want you to be on your guard.

24:48.583 --> 24:51.962
"Appropriate" for whom? Well,
don't jump down my throat, dear.

24:51.998 --> 24:55.340
I'm only offering friendly advice.
Why do you want to see Bates?

24:55.377 --> 24:57.973
To give him his old job back?
Not entirely.

24:58.009 --> 25:00.601
I mainly want to see him
because we parted badly.

25:00.637 --> 25:04.516
Telephone call for you, m'lord.
If you did, I'm sure it's his fault.

25:04.552 --> 25:06.601
No, it was mine.

25:11.148 --> 25:15.032
Oh, really! It's like living
in a second-rate hotel

25:15.068 --> 25:20.866
where the guests keep arriving
and no-one seems to leave!

25:24.202 --> 25:26.084
I see.

25:26.121 --> 25:29.499
Yes... Thank you
for letting me know.

25:33.086 --> 25:35.213
Are you all right, Papa?

25:39.676 --> 25:41.762
That was the War Office.

25:42.929 --> 25:48.060
Matthew and William went out on a patrol a few
days ago and they haven't been seen since.

25:48.096 --> 25:50.896
Oh, my God.
Let's not fall to pieces quite yet.

25:50.932 --> 25:53.153
It happens all the time, apparently,

25:53.190 --> 25:56.156
and the men turn up
in one field hospital or another.

25:56.193 --> 25:59.946
But they are treating them as missing
in action? It's too early for that.

25:59.983 --> 26:02.246
There could be lots of things
to explain it.

26:02.282 --> 26:05.744
You mean they could have been taken
prisoner? It's possible.

26:07.746 --> 26:11.046
Don't say anything to Mary...
or your mother,

26:11.083 --> 26:14.711
or anyone, in fact - not yet.
I shouldn't really have told you.

26:15.045 --> 26:18.465
What about Cousin Isobel?
I don't know how to contact her.

26:18.590 --> 26:21.593
Anyway, she's in France.
She may hear before we do.

26:28.934 --> 26:31.024
I'm not accusing her of anything,

26:31.061 --> 26:34.272
but I did wonder if you were aware
of this "special storage area"?

26:34.309 --> 26:37.984
I daresay Mrs Patmore has her own
system, like we all do.

26:39.111 --> 26:42.614
Right. Well, I'll say good night.
Good night.

26:44.241 --> 26:47.124
Ah, Mr Molesley. You're very late.

26:47.160 --> 26:50.002
I was doing some invisible mending
on one of his coats.

26:50.038 --> 26:54.292
I got a bit carried away, but I'm... I'm
quite pleased with the way it turned out.

26:55.419 --> 26:59.360
I don't see why you can't dress him
until there's a new valet.

26:59.397 --> 27:03.301
It'd be a blessing to Mr Carson.
I'd be happy to, if it'd help.

27:03.927 --> 27:07.139
Keep this up, and we won't be able
to do without you at all.

27:07.175 --> 27:09.224
There's no reason why you should.

27:10.142 --> 27:12.608
Oh, er, I may be wrong,

27:12.644 --> 27:18.316
but I thought I saw one of the officers
by the maids' staircase just now.

27:18.900 --> 27:21.778
I'm sure there's a perfectly
reasonable explanation.

27:21.815 --> 27:23.864
Let's hope so.

27:24.031 --> 27:26.116
Good night.

28:04.071 --> 28:06.156
What the bloody... Ethel!

28:06.448 --> 28:10.118
We were only... I know precisely
what you were doing, Major.

28:10.702 --> 28:14.873
I may not be a woman of the world,
but I don't live in a sack!

28:15.123 --> 28:18.668
Now, if you would kindly
take your things and go downstairs.

28:24.674 --> 28:28.908
Ethel, you are dismissed without
notice and without a character.

28:28.944 --> 28:33.141
You will please leave before
breakfast. I didn't think I was...

28:33.178 --> 28:35.435
No. And that's the problem.

28:36.186 --> 28:38.271
You never do.

28:45.654 --> 28:47.739
And you're not nervous?

28:48.740 --> 28:51.368
Well, I gather His Lordship
knows his own mind,

28:51.404 --> 28:53.709
but I've no difficulty with that.

28:53.745 --> 28:56.936
You'll enjoy working
in a big household.

28:56.972 --> 29:00.127
Better than staring at me
night after night!

29:01.628 --> 29:03.839
What would you say
if they ask you to stay?

29:05.173 --> 29:08.635
It would be a big step up for me.
There's no point in denying it.

29:08.672 --> 29:10.721
Because I think they might.

29:12.097 --> 29:14.182
Do you really, Mrs Bird?

29:14.850 --> 29:19.563
There goes Mr Molesley,
valet to the Earl of Grantham.

29:19.599 --> 29:21.773
Stop it!

29:26.445 --> 29:28.535
But why?

29:28.572 --> 29:31.700
What could you have possibly done
that's so terrible?

29:31.950 --> 29:34.536
Have I taken everything of mine
from there?

29:37.581 --> 29:40.375
Would you like me to speak to her?
Because I can.

29:40.876 --> 29:42.961
No. She wouldn't listen.

29:44.588 --> 29:46.673
She's not a bad person, Mrs Hughes.

29:46.798 --> 29:50.302
I know she can be strict, but she's
not - She wouldn't listen.

30:08.403 --> 30:10.238
We're closed.

30:18.455 --> 30:20.879
I know Ethel could be difficult,
Mrs Hughes,

30:20.916 --> 30:24.169
but she was very sorry for
her mistake, whatever it was.

30:24.205 --> 30:27.386
I'm sure. It's cost her her job.
But surely it can't...

30:27.422 --> 30:31.343
Never mind why she's gone, she's
gone - and there's an end to it.

30:32.969 --> 30:37.808
By the way, I hear
Mr Bates is back in the county.

30:38.308 --> 30:40.477
Mr Carson says
you know all about it.

30:44.189 --> 30:46.733
I gather His Lordship
has gone to see him.

30:46.770 --> 30:49.444
I know. He told me he was going.

30:50.862 --> 30:54.408
Why in heaven's name
didn't you mention any of it to me?

30:55.534 --> 30:57.619
It wasn't my secret to tell.

30:58.203 --> 31:03.625
I'm glad to hear it, but Carson said
your wife made all sorts of threats.

31:04.960 --> 31:07.087
She won't carry them out - not now.

31:08.338 --> 31:13.135
Since I left Downton, I've discovered
that she was... untrue to me.

31:13.969 --> 31:18.223
I may have been as bad in my heart, m'lord,
but I've done nothing to be ashamed of.

31:18.724 --> 31:21.747
The point is, I can divorce her now,
whether she likes it or not.

31:21.784 --> 31:25.112
But what's to stop her blurting out
her stories to the press?

31:25.149 --> 31:28.442
If she agrees to keep silent, I will
give her whatever she wants.

31:28.608 --> 31:32.446
She can't hold me now, so her choice
is between poverty and plenty.

31:33.196 --> 31:36.575
And what was the tale she was going
to tell? Carson never made it clear.

31:37.325 --> 31:40.829
Some silly nonsense, m'lord.
I wouldn't waste your time with it.

31:42.289 --> 31:44.374
What's the news from Downton?

31:45.792 --> 31:48.962
Daisy, you're not to worry
about William.

31:48.999 --> 31:51.345
I spoke to His Lordship earlier.

31:51.381 --> 31:55.302
He says you're not to be concerned
until we know more. But he is missing.

31:55.338 --> 31:58.477
I mean, they don't know where he is,
or Captain Crawley, do they?

31:58.513 --> 32:03.185
There could be a hundred explanations. Yes.
And one of them is that they're dead!

32:06.938 --> 32:09.571
Don't mistake me,
I hope very much they're not,

32:09.608 --> 32:13.195
but we ought to face the truth.
What may be the truth.

32:13.231 --> 32:15.280
And what very well may not!

32:18.200 --> 32:22.371
Anna, do you think that Mr Bates
will come back?

32:22.621 --> 32:25.457
That's for him to say.
I hope he does.

32:25.832 --> 32:28.585
He always seems
a romantic figure to me.

32:28.622 --> 32:31.301
Does he? How do you define "romantic"?

32:31.338 --> 32:36.009
It's no good him thinking he can turn up here
without a moment's notice and be cock of the walk!

32:36.046 --> 32:39.304
Why is that, Thomas?
Because the place is already taken?

32:45.894 --> 32:50.065
I hate the word "missing". It seems
to leave so little room for optimism.

32:51.358 --> 32:54.236
I tell myself
it's too early to despair,

32:57.531 --> 33:00.038
but to be honest, Bates,
I don't think I can bear it.

33:00.075 --> 33:03.745
Losing Patrick was bad enough,
but now the thought of Matthew gone

33:05.122 --> 33:07.499
and the future
once again destroyed...

33:09.167 --> 33:11.586
More than all that,
I loved him like a son.

33:14.715 --> 33:19.052
No, I LOVE him. Let's stay in the
present tense, while we still can.

33:22.264 --> 33:25.981
So, will you come back with me...

33:26.018 --> 33:28.311
and help me through
the Vale of Shadow?

33:30.397 --> 33:34.609
It's not what I expected, m'lord,
but... I will, if you want me to.

33:37.154 --> 33:41.116
I misjudged you, Bates,
and I abused you when we parted.

33:41.152 --> 33:43.493
I should have had more faith.
I'm sorry.

33:44.411 --> 33:47.914
God knows, you've shown more faith
in me than I had any right to.

33:52.335 --> 33:55.589
There we are. Get this basket
off my arm. It weighs a ton!

34:16.318 --> 34:18.402
Sybil?

34:18.652 --> 34:21.161
I never said anything to Granny,
honestly.

34:21.197 --> 34:25.206
Then why did she start talking about
"inappropriate friendships" out of nowhere?

34:25.243 --> 34:30.206
She thinks you must have a beau and if we don't know
about him, then you have to be keeping him secret.

34:30.243 --> 34:33.172
It's just Granny being Granny.
Don't make such a thing of it.

34:33.210 --> 34:36.963
I don't deserve to be told off - not
by her or by you. Nothing's happened.

34:40.092 --> 34:43.016
Why? What might have happened?
I mean it.

34:43.053 --> 34:46.228
We haven't kissed, or anything.
I don't think we've shaken hands!

34:46.264 --> 34:50.060
I'm not even sure if I like him like
that. He says I do, but I'm still not sure.

34:50.096 --> 34:52.442
We are talking about...
Branson, yes.

34:52.478 --> 34:55.987
The chauffeur, Branson?
Oh, how disappointing of you!

34:56.024 --> 34:59.324
I'm just trying to get it straight
you and the chauffeur...

34:59.361 --> 35:03.323
You know I don't care about all of
that. Darling, don't be such a baby.

35:03.360 --> 35:05.951
This isn't fairyland.
What did you think?

35:06.368 --> 35:09.913
You'd marry the chauffeur and we'd
all come to tea? Don't be silly.

35:09.950 --> 35:13.458
I told you, I don't even think I like
him. What has he said to you?

35:14.668 --> 35:18.338
That he loves me and wants me to run
away with him. Good God in heaven!

35:18.714 --> 35:21.633
He's frightfully full of himself.
You don't say!

35:22.634 --> 35:25.762
But I haven't encouraged him.
I haven't said anything, really.

35:25.799 --> 35:28.724
You haven't given him away, though.
Will you?

35:29.516 --> 35:32.019
Well, I won't betray him
on one condition:

35:32.055 --> 35:34.485
You must promise
not to do anything stupid.

35:34.521 --> 35:37.524
You must promise now,
or I'll tell Papa tonight.

35:39.818 --> 35:41.903
I promise.

36:05.469 --> 36:10.557
Mr Bates!
You're a sight for sore eyes.

36:11.183 --> 36:13.518
Welcome home.
Thank you, Mrs Hughes.

36:16.063 --> 36:18.648
I thought it was you. Hello.

36:20.067 --> 36:24.780
Come away in and give some substance
to the gossip of your return.

36:30.911 --> 36:34.122
You'll find things a bit different
from when you left, Mr Bates.

36:34.159 --> 36:36.208
Downton at war. Precisely.

36:36.625 --> 36:40.170
There's some extra help
in the kitchen, all very nice people

36:40.206 --> 36:43.715
and the nurses, of course,
but they live down at the hospital.

36:43.752 --> 36:47.302
Except for Lady Sybil.
Nurse Crawley, please!

36:50.222 --> 36:55.936
So we've both returned, you and I.
A couple of bad pennies.

36:56.144 --> 37:00.315
I haven't. Thomas means
he's not here as a servant.

37:00.565 --> 37:03.276
He manages the house.
He's a sergeant now.

37:03.735 --> 37:05.821
I take orders from Major Clarkson.

37:06.613 --> 37:10.325
He runs this place on behalf
of the Army Medical Corps.

37:11.034 --> 37:13.412
Yet another reason
to pray for peace!

37:14.496 --> 37:18.125
I heard about William from His
Lordship. And Captain Crawley.

37:19.501 --> 37:21.920
I'm sure they're all right.

37:23.672 --> 37:26.967
Sorry I'm late!
Has the dressing gong rung yet?

37:27.003 --> 37:29.224
You're not late, Mr Molesley,
but er...

37:29.261 --> 37:33.223
Mr Bates is back, and you reminded
me. I'd better ring it now.

37:34.433 --> 37:38.979
Are you staying... for good? I'd need a crystal
ball to answer that, but I'll stay for now.

37:39.730 --> 37:43.650
Have you been standing in for me? I
was going to, starting tonight, yeah.

37:43.687 --> 37:47.112
Then you'll be relieved to see me.
Oh, tremendously.

37:47.738 --> 37:49.823
What's that?

37:50.407 --> 37:53.618
It's a new kind of shoehorn.
I bought it for His Lordship.

37:53.655 --> 37:55.996
That's very kind of you,
Mr Molesley. Thank you.

38:00.876 --> 38:03.920
Daisy, fetch me some more tea.
Thomas, I've got dinner...

38:03.957 --> 38:06.798
Hot, this time,
and it's Sergeant Barrow to you.

38:14.765 --> 38:17.981
Watch yourself, Mr Bates.
Thomas is in charge now.

38:18.018 --> 38:22.230
It won't do to get on the wrong side
of him. Is there a right side?

38:24.358 --> 38:27.652
I don't believe it.
Why would she sell food to Mrs Bird?

38:27.689 --> 38:29.535
It makes no sense.

38:29.571 --> 38:33.784
Well, I can't confirm
the details of the arrangement.

38:33.820 --> 38:37.079
Maybe they both sell it
and divide the proceeds.

38:37.412 --> 38:39.336
Either way, I felt you should know.

38:39.373 --> 38:43.126
Have you said anything to Mrs Hughes
or Carson? I've tried with her,

38:43.163 --> 38:45.879
but there's none so blind
as them that will not see.

38:47.214 --> 38:49.716
I'm curious.
Next time, come and fetch me.

38:52.719 --> 38:56.056
So Bates is back.
Papa must be pleased.

38:56.092 --> 38:58.141
And Mr Carson won't be sorry.

39:00.811 --> 39:03.605
Branson, there's something
you ought to know.

39:05.440 --> 39:07.526
I've told Mary.

39:09.027 --> 39:11.113
I see.

39:11.988 --> 39:15.659
Well, that's me finished, then -
and without a reference.

39:15.695 --> 39:18.083
No, she's not like that.
You don't know her.

39:18.120 --> 39:20.872
She wouldn't give us away.
But she won't encourage us.

39:21.873 --> 39:23.959
No.

39:25.210 --> 39:28.338
Why are you smiling?
I thought you'd be angry.

39:30.215 --> 39:33.844
Because that's the first time
you've ever spoken about "us".

39:37.097 --> 39:40.308
If you didn't care,
you would have told them months ago.

39:40.345 --> 39:43.484
Oh, I see. Because I don't want you
to lose your job,

39:43.520 --> 39:46.857
it must mean I'm madly in love
with you. Well, doesn't it?

39:48.316 --> 39:50.991
You say I'm a free spirit,
and I hope I am,

39:51.028 --> 39:54.531
but you're asking me to give up
my whole world and everyone in it.

39:54.568 --> 39:57.743
And that's too high a price to pay?
It IS a high price!

39:58.410 --> 40:00.746
I love my parents - you don't know them...

40:00.782 --> 40:02.836
and I love my sisters, my friends...

40:02.873 --> 40:05.375
I'm not asking you
to give them up for ever.

40:05.709 --> 40:08.712
When they come around,
I will welcome them with open arms.

40:08.748 --> 40:11.631
And what about your people?
Would they accept ME?

40:11.840 --> 40:16.678
And what about my work? What work? Bringing
hot drinks to a lot of randy officers?

40:17.012 --> 40:21.058
Look - it comes down to whether
or not you love me. That's all.

40:21.094 --> 40:24.436
That's it. The rest is detail.

40:27.272 --> 40:30.609
I've written to Vera, spelling out
the case and how she cannot win it.

40:30.645 --> 40:34.154
Then I've told her I will be
generous, if she will co-operate.

40:34.738 --> 40:37.824
Are you ready to give her everything?
Because I am.

40:39.576 --> 40:42.996
Whatever it takes. I want a clean
break and not an open wound.

40:43.033 --> 40:46.208
If we can just be patient
a little while longer.

40:48.794 --> 40:52.047
We shouldn't be outside. It's cold.

40:54.549 --> 40:58.178
I'll be patient and bear anything,

41:02.766 --> 41:06.103
except for you to go away again.
No. That's done.

41:07.521 --> 41:11.650
You're stuck with me now...
for good and proper.

41:19.157 --> 41:21.326
There's something you ought to know.

41:22.369 --> 41:26.415
Papa said not to tell you, but I
don't think he's right. Go on.

41:28.875 --> 41:30.961
Matthew's missing.

41:31.336 --> 41:34.881
He was on patrol
and he's just sort of... vanished.

41:36.591 --> 41:39.761
Papa hasn't told anyone.
Not even Mama.

41:41.346 --> 41:44.182
I only know because I was there
when he found out.

41:44.850 --> 41:47.436
It didn't seem right
to keep you in the dark.

41:48.311 --> 41:50.355
I'm not trying to upset you, truly.

41:51.523 --> 41:53.608
For once in my life, I believe you.

42:09.166 --> 42:12.419
They've told you, then?
Do they all know downstairs?

42:13.378 --> 42:17.174
William's missing, too. I think
everyone knows except Her Ladyship.

42:17.883 --> 42:20.224
I wish Edith had left it
till the morning.

42:20.260 --> 42:23.388
I could have faced it all
with one more night of sleep.

42:31.688 --> 42:33.946
Mind out, this is hot.
Daisy! Spoons!

42:33.982 --> 42:36.860
Unless they're to drink
directly from the bowl!

42:37.778 --> 42:40.989
Do you think there's enough?
You could feed about 50, I reckon.

42:43.533 --> 42:45.660
Go for the vegetable one.
The vegetable...

42:47.245 --> 42:52.292
May we come in?
Your Ladyship... What a surprise.

42:52.959 --> 42:57.798
O'Brien seemed to think that you and Mrs Bird were
engaged in a commercial venture of some sort,

42:57.834 --> 43:01.343
so I came to see for myself.
We are not, Your Ladyship!

43:01.379 --> 43:03.642
I agree
that's not what it looks like.

43:03.678 --> 43:07.432
We feed these men once a week
and I'm not ashamed of it.

43:08.266 --> 43:11.812
I'll be back before luncheon
at the big house. I'm sure.

43:12.813 --> 43:15.440
But is it true
they are fed from our kitchens?

43:16.692 --> 43:20.075
Only the stuff the army gives.
They ARE soldiers.

43:20.112 --> 43:24.741
What did I tell you? Daisy's right.
We only use the food the army pay for,

43:24.778 --> 43:27.285
and all the men
have served their country.

43:34.501 --> 43:39.339
In future, I would prefer it if you
would use food paid for by the house.

43:40.424 --> 43:43.301
I don't want the army
to accuse us of mismanagement.

43:44.302 --> 43:47.347
You're going to let them get away
with it? Oh, more than that.

43:47.384 --> 43:49.646
I'm going to help them -
and so are you.

43:49.683 --> 43:54.396
Molesley. Ma'am. If you bring that
table over, I suggest we divide the food.

43:54.432 --> 43:56.940
Then we can form two lines
and it will go faster.

43:57.733 --> 43:59.818
O'Brien, you can manage the bread.

44:00.986 --> 44:02.946
Daisy? Of course, m'lady.

44:03.155 --> 44:05.741
Mmm... What is it?
Beef stew, m'lady.

44:06.450 --> 44:08.535
Stand in a line.

44:20.380 --> 44:22.466
Sergeant, one moment.

44:25.427 --> 44:29.389
I hear you're becoming mighty imperious
in your manner with the staff here.

44:29.426 --> 44:31.475
Er, Daisy in particular.

44:31.808 --> 44:36.605
Just because you're a poacher turned gamekeeper,
there's no need for rudeness. No, sir.

44:37.397 --> 44:39.483
So mind what I say.

44:40.359 --> 44:42.444
Carry on.

44:47.115 --> 44:49.201
I've done as you asked, Mrs Hughes.

44:49.743 --> 44:51.828
I think Barrow's taken it on board.

44:52.204 --> 44:55.832
He's getting grander than Lady Mary,
and that's saying something!

44:58.752 --> 45:01.171
Lady Grantham.
Hello, Doctor Clarkson.

45:15.102 --> 45:18.146
It was Bates.
I saw him watching you.

45:19.439 --> 45:24.111
He must have gone straight to the Major and
sneaked on you the moment your back was turned.

45:24.147 --> 45:26.905
Oh, well. Some things never change.

45:27.322 --> 45:31.201
Don't worry. He's more vulnerable
than when he was last here.

45:32.369 --> 45:36.915
Why?
Because we know more, that's why.

45:39.167 --> 45:41.837
Why haven't you told me till now?
I'm not sure.

45:42.671 --> 45:44.756
Perhaps I envied your ignorance.

45:45.757 --> 45:48.218
I'm not giving up hope. Not yet.

45:49.177 --> 45:53.515
Nor me, of course, but I think
we should start to prepare.

45:55.183 --> 45:57.269
Isobel doesn't know?

45:57.811 --> 45:59.896
I haven't been able to reach her.

46:00.105 --> 46:04.067
Have you said anything to Mary?
Edith's already told me.

46:05.110 --> 46:09.656
Has she? Well, I suppose
it was too tempting to resist.

46:10.365 --> 46:13.827
Oddly enough, I don't think
she was trying to make trouble.

46:14.828 --> 46:18.290
We ought to go down.
It's time for the concert.

46:18.326 --> 46:20.584
Who cares about the stupid concert?

46:21.126 --> 46:23.211
The men do, and we should, too...

46:24.254 --> 46:26.965
because we have to keep going,
whatever happens.

46:27.002 --> 46:29.051
We have to help each other
to keep going.

47:01.750 --> 47:05.629
Cora tells me Matthew's gone
missing. Is that true?

47:06.088 --> 47:09.596
There's no proof of anything yet.
I see.

47:09.633 --> 47:12.344
Well, I need more than that
to make me anxious.

47:13.678 --> 47:17.474
I'm glad you would be anxious.
Of course I would be.

47:19.059 --> 47:23.563
We're used to Matthew now.
God knows who the next heir will be.

47:24.523 --> 47:28.485
Probably a chimneysweep
from Solihull! Huh!

47:44.751 --> 47:46.884
Most of you won't know
how rare it is

47:46.920 --> 47:50.048
to see my sister Edith and I
pulling together in a double act...

47:50.085 --> 47:52.181
A unicorn, if ever there was one.

47:52.217 --> 47:56.680
But in wartime we, like all of you, have
more important things to worry about.

47:57.180 --> 48:00.976
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you... the Crawley Sisters.

48:01.012 --> 48:04.813
Well, now I've seen everything!

48:05.981 --> 48:11.028
Sometimes when I feel bad.

48:11.153 --> 48:15.449
And things look blue

48:16.783 --> 48:22.059
I wish a pal I had.

48:22.096 --> 48:27.335
Say one like you.

48:27.878 --> 48:32.507
Someone within my heart.

48:33.008 --> 48:37.554
To build a throne.

48:38.805 --> 48:43.518
Someone who'd never part.

48:44.019 --> 48:48.774
To call my own.

48:49.858 --> 48:55.655
If you were the only girl
in the world.

48:55.692 --> 49:00.452
And I were the only boy.

49:01.870 --> 49:06.833
Nothing else would matter
in the world today.

49:07.626 --> 49:12.130
We could go on loving
in the same old way...

49:29.439 --> 49:31.525
Thank God...

49:32.609 --> 49:35.612
My dear boy. My very dear boy!

49:42.202 --> 49:44.287
Come on, don't stop for me.

49:47.416 --> 49:51.670
I would say
such wonderful things to you.

49:53.046 --> 49:58.260
There would be
such wonderful things to do.

49:58.969 --> 50:04.307
If you were the only girl
in the world.

50:04.933 --> 50:10.605
And I were the only boy.

50:22.576 --> 50:24.791
Somehow, we got lost

50:24.828 --> 50:28.212
and then we were trapped behind some
Germans for three days.

50:28.248 --> 50:31.543
When we got out of that, we stumbled
into a field dressing station,

50:31.580 --> 50:33.634
where we were immediately admitted.

50:33.670 --> 50:36.386
We weren't in any danger,
so they didn't inform our unit.

50:36.423 --> 50:39.468
They should have jolly well told us
when you got back to base.

50:39.504 --> 50:42.346
I hope you weren't really worried.
Oh, you know us.

50:42.382 --> 50:44.603
We like to be sure of our hero
at the front.

50:44.639 --> 50:48.852
I beg your pardon, m'lord, but
the Dowager Countess is leaving. Ah.

50:54.066 --> 50:56.281
What will you do
with the rest of your leave?

50:56.318 --> 50:59.780
Well, since Mother isn't here, I'll
run up to London and see Lavinia.

51:03.241 --> 51:06.953
I got your letter about Carlisle.
I hope you'll approve.

51:07.621 --> 51:10.379
I know you don't like him much now -
I hardly know him,

51:10.415 --> 51:14.378
but I'm sure I'll like him when I do.
That's if he's good to you.

51:15.170 --> 51:17.464
If he's not,
he'll have me to answer to.

51:25.013 --> 51:28.725
Who'd have thought an amateur concert
could be the summit of all joy?

51:28.762 --> 51:31.645
I've lived in such a fog of misery
since I left you,

51:32.270 --> 51:35.190
I think I'd forgotten what happiness
is. Me, too.

51:36.233 --> 51:39.152
But now we must get used to feeling
happy... and trust it.

51:39.611 --> 51:41.697
God, I want to.

51:47.869 --> 51:50.080
Love's young dream?
I don't think!

51:51.039 --> 51:53.125
I'm not sure I care much.

51:53.750 --> 51:55.836
Are you going soft in your old age?

51:56.169 --> 51:59.881
I don't like him - he's a patronizing
bastard who sneaks behind my back,

51:59.918 --> 52:02.551
but I've got other things to worry
about. Really?

52:02.587 --> 52:05.142
That's interesting. Why?

52:05.178 --> 52:07.889
Because obviously,
I hold a grudge longer than you.

52:09.516 --> 52:13.061
I knew nothing bad had happened.
I felt it in my waters!

52:13.979 --> 52:17.024
What about you?
Did you have me boxed up and buried?

52:17.566 --> 52:20.235
I am glad you're all right, honest.
You should be.

52:20.777 --> 52:23.363
It's the thought of you
that keeps me going.

52:38.503 --> 52:41.131
Hello? Hello?

52:50.307 --> 52:55.687
Ethel? What on earth
are you doing here?

52:55.979 --> 52:58.065
I had to come, Mrs Hughes.

52:59.566 --> 53:03.695
I'm sorry to push in, but I was sitting
alone until I couldn't stand it no more.

53:03.732 --> 53:07.240
You've got to help me.
I haven't "got to" do anything!

53:08.075 --> 53:10.243
But what do you mean?
Help with what?

53:11.244 --> 53:13.580
Is this about Major Bryant?

53:17.417 --> 53:21.713
I blame myself for not stepping in
earlier - that I will admit.

53:23.048 --> 53:25.717
How long had it been going on?

53:28.970 --> 53:31.056
Long enough to get me pregnant.

53:32.432 --> 53:34.518
Mrs Hughes, I'm going to have a baby.

53:35.305 --> 53:41.801
