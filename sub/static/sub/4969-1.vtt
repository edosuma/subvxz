00:27.590 --> 00:30.670
Pull that lever!
She's coming in wild!

04:02.150 --> 04:06.630
Air-call number JYG 176542.

04:06.630 --> 04:09.430
Mr. Buckman took off
from Houston at 10:22,

04:09.430 --> 04:11.350
destination the Bahamas.

04:11.350 --> 04:13.630
That should put him
about halfway there.

04:13.750 --> 04:17.269
Of course it's emergency priority. Would
I call you if it was anything else?

04:17.390 --> 04:19.190
Happy New Year, Irene.

04:19.190 --> 04:22.070
Yeah. Calhoun number 5,
Baytown.

04:22.190 --> 04:26.470
Any field closer than Houston
can take the Jet Star?
No. Bring 'em back here.

04:26.470 --> 04:29.950
Well, put away your little
whistle, Georgie, and load up.

04:29.950 --> 04:32.910
- Yes, ma'am.
- Hello?

04:32.910 --> 04:35.030
Yes, Irene.

04:35.030 --> 04:38.670
Oh. Well,
hold on a minute.

04:40.590 --> 04:43.950
Bill, what's the flying time
back to Houston?

04:43.950 --> 04:46.910
Ed Calhoun's number 5.

04:47.030 --> 04:49.110
Eighty-eight minutes,
Chance.

04:49.110 --> 04:51.510
Well, turn around easy.

04:51.510 --> 04:55.150
We wouldn't wanna scatter
Mr. Lomax's winnings.

04:56.790 --> 05:00.710
Irene, you can have the copter
pick me up in an hour and a half.

05:00.830 --> 05:02.630
Right.

05:02.750 --> 05:05.510
And a Happy New Year
to you too.

05:06.950 --> 05:10.110
Sorry, folks.
We'll try again next year.

05:10.230 --> 05:15.030
Oh, don't apologize. This is
better than gambling in the Bahamas.

05:27.870 --> 05:30.350
Yeah, Irene.

05:30.470 --> 05:32.750
Okay. I'm on the way.

05:32.870 --> 05:35.910
And, uh, Happy New Year
to ya.

05:35.910 --> 05:38.510
Bueno. Acapulco Plaza.

05:38.590 --> 05:41.950
No, I'm sorry. Mr. Gregory Parker
is not in his room,

05:42.070 --> 05:43.870
and he does not answer
the page.

05:43.990 --> 05:47.030
Do you have
a Dolores Juarez registered?

05:49.630 --> 05:51.830
How 'bout Lupe Estaban?

05:54.350 --> 05:56.270
Yolanda Rodriquez?

05:56.270 --> 05:58.070
Si. Un momento.

06:02.030 --> 06:04.870
Bueno. Â¿Quien?

06:07.470 --> 06:10.350
Who knows you are here
with me in Acapulco?

06:10.350 --> 06:12.270
Nobody but you, baby...

06:12.270 --> 06:14.190
I thought.

06:14.190 --> 06:16.590
Yeah, Irene.

06:16.590 --> 06:19.950
I'll grab the 6:10 plane
out of Mexico City.

06:19.950 --> 06:24.070
Check arrival time in Houston,
have the chopper meet me.

06:24.150 --> 06:26.950
Huh?

06:27.030 --> 06:28.870
Same to you.

06:31.070 --> 06:34.510
- It is a fire?
- Yep. You wanna go?

06:34.510 --> 06:39.310
It all started between us
at that fire near Durango.

06:39.430 --> 06:41.830
- No.
- Aw...

06:41.910 --> 06:44.390
I could not live
through another one.

07:09.630 --> 07:11.910
This one's all set.

07:12.030 --> 07:15.670
Well, move it on in.
Pick some of that iron up.

07:17.950 --> 07:20.830
Can you save the wellhead, Chance,
or am I gonna have to redrill it?

07:20.830 --> 07:24.950
Don't cut your throat yet,
Calhoun.
We'll do what we can.

07:25.070 --> 07:26.870
- Uh, Mr. Buckman.
- Yeah?

07:26.990 --> 07:29.950
Acquaint our television audience with what's
going on. Have you got anything to say?

07:30.070 --> 07:33.310
Yeah, your TV truck's
too close.

07:48.670 --> 07:50.950
Happy New Year!

07:51.070 --> 07:53.550
New year, new job,
everything.

07:53.630 --> 07:55.470
Helen, this is
Chance Buckman.

07:55.550 --> 07:57.390
- Helen Meadows.
- How do you do?

07:57.470 --> 07:59.310
She was on the plane
from Mexico City.

07:59.390 --> 08:01.230
She's never seen
an oil-well fire.

08:01.310 --> 08:05.910
Well, I hope you find this one
very interesting, Miss Meadows.
Thank you.

08:10.910 --> 08:14.270
I thought your menu
for New Year's was Mexican.

08:14.350 --> 08:18.110
That was last night.
Why waste a perfectly good fire?

08:18.190 --> 08:21.070
Are you gonna watch it
with her, or join us?

08:21.070 --> 08:22.990
Huh? Oh, yeah.

08:23.070 --> 08:26.350
- Uh, where are my work clothes?
- Calhoun's trailer.

08:44.550 --> 08:47.270
- You're going to go into that?
- Uh-huh.

08:47.270 --> 08:50.710
You're insane, and so am I
for not going on to Denver.

08:50.790 --> 08:53.670
Whoa, honey.
Denver's full of ice and snow...

08:53.670 --> 08:56.830
and very cold people.

09:23.110 --> 09:25.510
It's funny.

09:25.510 --> 09:29.830
But for the first time,
I got this sort of a feeling.

09:31.670 --> 09:33.870
It's having met you,
I guess.

09:38.350 --> 09:40.670
I just had to do that.

09:46.990 --> 09:49.310
Greg, what do you think?

09:49.390 --> 09:51.230
What does Chance say?

09:51.310 --> 09:54.950
- Well, not to cut my throat yet.
- Settle for that.

09:54.950 --> 09:59.270
Mr. Parker, what have you got
to say on this situation?
Move your truck back.

09:59.270 --> 10:01.590
- Can't you tell our audience what's being done?
- Tell 'em, Cal.

10:01.590 --> 10:05.910
- Mr. Calhoun...
- Larkin here will tell ya. He's my field superintendent.

10:10.590 --> 10:13.470
I notice those fancy
red jumpsuits out there.

10:13.550 --> 10:15.470
Why do Buckman and his crew
wear them?

10:15.590 --> 10:19.910
I gather that's
smart showmanship, eh?
Well, you gather wrong.

10:19.910 --> 10:22.950
Every eye is on those
red suits watching for signals.

10:22.950 --> 10:25.470
- Nobody else gives orders.
- Oh, I see.

10:25.550 --> 10:27.390
Hey, what the hell's
goin' on?

10:27.470 --> 10:29.590
The equipment's
overheating!

11:16.190 --> 11:18.670
They've got to clear away
every piece of metal,

11:18.790 --> 11:22.910
otherwise when they blow the fire out,
the hot metal will reignite it.

11:48.310 --> 11:51.790
According to Mr. Larkin, that section
of drill pipe you see sticking out...

11:51.870 --> 11:53.710
has to be cut off
right at the wellhead...

11:53.790 --> 11:55.590
before they can move in
with the nitro.

11:55.710 --> 11:59.070
It's spreading the flame. They've got to
have a single column shooting straight up...

11:59.150 --> 12:01.350
before they'll try
to blow it.

12:24.950 --> 12:28.590
Just how soon before they'll
attempt to blow this fire out?

12:28.710 --> 12:31.110
They won't try to kill it 'til they're
ready to cap the well.

12:31.190 --> 12:35.390
The control head's being assembled
to Buckman's order and isn't here yet.

12:38.390 --> 12:41.150
Joe, we better get to work
on that nitro.

12:45.870 --> 12:48.350
Don't tell me, I know.

12:48.350 --> 12:51.310
You're bushed.
You'd like to take a little nap.

12:51.430 --> 12:53.830
Well, I was up
all night.

12:53.830 --> 12:56.510
Of course you couldn't have
slept on the plane.

12:56.590 --> 13:00.150
What'd you use for openers this trip?
The old headache gag?

13:00.230 --> 13:03.710
Why, you poor man.
Perhaps if I rubbed your neck.

13:03.790 --> 13:05.630
True, every word, true.

13:05.710 --> 13:07.550
But it works.

13:07.630 --> 13:09.750
Well, I can't say
I blame ya.

13:09.830 --> 13:14.430
A fella as ugly as you are couldn't get
to first base without a fire.

13:58.350 --> 14:00.270
Here's the control head.

14:09.030 --> 14:12.070
Get it rigged.
I'll finish with the nitro.

14:12.070 --> 14:13.990
Okay. George!

14:21.390 --> 14:24.830
Sorry to interrupt
your nap.

14:24.950 --> 14:27.230
Yeah, George said
it broke your heart.

14:27.310 --> 14:30.110
One of these days
some husband or boyfriend's...

14:30.190 --> 14:32.030
gonna show up
with a 12 gauge...

14:32.110 --> 14:35.270
and turn your prat
into a punchboard.

14:52.470 --> 14:55.150
The drum filled with nitro
is covered with asbestos...

14:55.150 --> 14:57.550
and kept wet to keep it
from exploding too soon.

14:57.630 --> 15:01.190
For the benefit of our television
audience, what'll happen if it does?

15:01.270 --> 15:03.670
There won't be enough left of them
to pick up and put together.

15:03.790 --> 15:07.110
Then we better get back
in this remote truck. Come on!

15:13.750 --> 15:17.310
The explosion eliminates the oxygen
which is what kills the fire,

15:17.310 --> 15:21.230
but the nitro drum has to be
placed in exactly the right position.

17:00.670 --> 17:03.350
They're using brass tools
to avoid creating a spark.

17:03.350 --> 17:06.230
Even the static electricity of a man
running his hand through his hair...

17:06.349 --> 17:08.150
could set if off again.

17:28.109 --> 17:31.190
Ah, what a great sound!

17:31.190 --> 17:33.110
That's it!

17:40.110 --> 17:44.510
Now we can get a statement
from Chance Buckman himself!
Hey!

17:52.950 --> 17:55.070
Back off!

17:58.310 --> 18:01.390
- Ambulance!
- Ambulance!

18:01.470 --> 18:03.310
Come on!

18:13.550 --> 18:15.470
Stay back!

18:35.030 --> 18:37.830
Mr. Parker,
do you think it's serious?

18:51.350 --> 18:54.150
No, we're still
sweating him out, Cal.

18:54.230 --> 18:57.030
Sure. Sure, Cal.

18:57.110 --> 19:00.830
The minute I know anything.
Thanks.

19:07.270 --> 19:09.670
Joe, how is he?

19:09.750 --> 19:11.590
He's still in surgery,
Jack.

19:11.670 --> 19:13.510
He took
a real bad beating.

19:13.590 --> 19:15.990
Aw, he's had busted
ribs before.

19:15.990 --> 19:17.910
This time
his lung's punctured.

19:17.910 --> 19:23.470
It's bad enough that Greg got the number
from Irene and called San Francisco.

19:23.590 --> 19:25.390
Madelyn and Tish?

19:25.510 --> 19:27.790
How in the hell
did he hear about them?

19:27.910 --> 19:31.550
- Did you open your...
- One night last year down in Mexi...

19:32.790 --> 19:36.430
Chance got stoned to the eyes, and Greg
spotted a photograph in his wallet.

19:36.430 --> 19:38.830
Greg asked Chance
who it is,

19:38.830 --> 19:41.030
Chance tells him it's
his wife and daughter,

19:41.110 --> 19:45.070
and if Greg ever mentions it again,
he's gonna break him in two, that's how.

19:45.150 --> 19:47.070
They're not
coming here?

19:47.070 --> 19:50.910
Well, Madelyn's in Europe, and
the girl's skiing in Jackson, Wyoming.

19:50.990 --> 19:52.910
Greg flew up to get her.

19:52.910 --> 19:56.190
- You couldn't stop him, eh?
- No. I agreed with him.

19:56.270 --> 19:58.110
Suppose Chance...
Suppose...

19:58.190 --> 20:00.990
Suppose it doesn't look like
he's gonna make it?

20:01.070 --> 20:04.350
At least he might have time enough
to see his child.

20:35.990 --> 20:38.270
- Miss Buckman?
- Yes.

20:38.390 --> 20:40.590
I'm Greg Parker.
I phoned you.

20:44.430 --> 20:46.630
Thank you.

20:46.630 --> 20:49.110
I'm a little uncertain
about this.

20:49.230 --> 20:51.710
Funny time to be uncertain,
isn't it?

20:51.790 --> 20:54.670
I mean, I'm not sure
I should come at all.

20:54.790 --> 20:56.910
That's funnier yet.

20:56.990 --> 21:01.590
Just a minute.
You said he didn't ask for me.
This was your idea.

21:01.590 --> 21:04.950
What difference does that make?
He's your father, and he might die.

21:04.950 --> 21:07.070
Would you get aboard,
please?

21:30.470 --> 21:34.190
You, uh...
you okay?

21:36.230 --> 21:38.030
I don't know.

21:38.110 --> 21:41.310
Frankly, I don't know
how I'm supposed to feel.

21:41.390 --> 21:44.350
I'm sorry he's hurt.
I want him to get better.

21:45.590 --> 21:47.990
But l...
I hardly remember my father.

21:47.990 --> 21:50.870
Your mother never took the time
to fill you in on him?

21:50.990 --> 21:54.910
All she ever told me was that
he was in the oil business,

21:54.990 --> 21:56.830
and that he was
a wonderful man...

21:56.910 --> 21:58.750
and that she was
the wrong woman for him.

21:58.830 --> 22:03.430
When I was old enough to realize
how unhappy it made her,
I stopped asking questions.

22:03.550 --> 22:06.790
Well, she couldn't exactly rap him for
all the dough he must've been sending her.

22:06.910 --> 22:08.710
She never took a penny
from him, that I know.

22:08.830 --> 22:11.990
Her name was Randolph, of Randolph
Department Stores in San Francisco.

22:11.990 --> 22:14.870
Oh, yeah, Randolph.
Well, that, uh...

22:14.870 --> 22:18.310
That made it easy for her
to walk out on him, didn't it?

22:18.310 --> 22:20.630
You're struggling to be
some sort of boor.

22:20.710 --> 22:23.030
- No, I just know it wasn't Chance's fault.
- Were you there?

22:23.030 --> 22:25.390
No, no, but I got
a clear picture now.

22:25.510 --> 22:28.270
He had the bad luck
to marry a complete bitch.

22:28.390 --> 22:30.670
Shorty, it's getting
hard to breathe in here.

22:30.790 --> 22:34.510
- Why don't you go forward?
- l...
I, uh...

22:36.230 --> 22:38.070
I will.

22:42.390 --> 22:44.190
Look, I'm sorry.

22:44.310 --> 22:46.230
It's just that your dad,

22:46.230 --> 22:48.830
he means...

22:48.910 --> 22:50.710
I-I'm sorry.

23:05.670 --> 23:07.510
Hiya, Joe.
How is he?

23:07.590 --> 23:09.910
It wasn't near as bad as we were told.
He's gonna be all right.

23:09.990 --> 23:11.830
- Knock wood.
- Tish!

23:11.910 --> 23:14.710
- Uncle Jack!
- So good to see you.

23:14.790 --> 23:17.390
They just brought him down.
The doctor'll be out in a minute.

23:17.470 --> 23:20.070
- It seems you know each other.
- I've known him all my life.

23:20.190 --> 23:22.670
- This is Joe Horn, dear. George Harris.
- Hi.

23:22.750 --> 23:27.270
The last time I saw you,
you were in rompers.
Hello again.

23:27.270 --> 23:29.190
I didn't know
you knew my father.

23:29.270 --> 23:31.590
Your father
wanted it that way.

23:31.670 --> 23:33.510
And your mother
went along with it.

23:33.590 --> 23:37.070
I've just been keeping track
of both of you... for him.

23:37.150 --> 23:39.150
I'm completely...

23:39.270 --> 23:43.950
Not nearly as surprised,
if that's what you mean, as I am.
Here's the doctor.

23:44.070 --> 23:48.750
Well, as usual, he's not what you'd
call the most cooperative patient.

23:48.830 --> 23:51.430
Halfway out of the anesthetic
he says, "Where's my pants?

23:51.550 --> 23:55.350
I want to get out
of this hospital."
Figures.

23:55.470 --> 23:58.430
- May we see him?
- No, I had to put him out but good.

23:58.550 --> 24:01.590
It looks like we're gonna have to keep
him unconscious to hold him a spell.

24:01.710 --> 24:04.190
- Could I see him?
- It'll be at least the end of the week.

24:04.270 --> 24:06.670
Bill, this is
his daughter.

24:06.790 --> 24:10.710
Oh? Oh, well, then come along,
Miss Buckman, come along.

24:12.430 --> 24:14.270
Uh...

24:14.350 --> 24:16.750
what-what's all
the mystery about?

24:16.750 --> 24:20.310
There's no mystery.
There just seems to be.

24:20.390 --> 24:25.470
Boy, there's nothing like a nice
clean-cut, straightforward answer.

24:25.470 --> 24:27.590
Thank you, Jack.

25:13.630 --> 25:18.030
This is my place,
and this is your father's.
We both have guest rooms.

25:20.710 --> 25:23.310
I think you'd prefer
your father's.

25:30.870 --> 25:33.590
Mr. Lomax!
How is he, Mr. Lomax?

25:33.670 --> 25:36.550
- Ah, he's gonna be fine, Hernando.
- Gracias a Dios.

25:36.550 --> 25:39.150
This is Mr. Buckman's daughter.
She'll be staying with us.

25:39.230 --> 25:41.910
Put her bags in
the guest room, will you?

25:42.590 --> 25:44.910
Anything I can
get you, senorita?

25:44.990 --> 25:47.750
- Uh, no, thank you.
- You can turn in now, Hernando.

25:47.870 --> 25:50.350
- Bueno. Buenas noches.
- Good night.

25:50.350 --> 25:53.430
Well, as long as I've got
a lot of talking to do,

25:53.430 --> 25:57.150
- I think I can do it better with a drink.
- All right.

25:57.270 --> 25:59.750
Comin' right up.
Tish?

25:59.750 --> 26:04.350
Uh, Scotch rocks, now that you don't
look like you want to slip me a mickey.

26:04.470 --> 26:06.750
Seems we started off
with sort of a ruckus.

26:06.870 --> 26:11.070
Divided loyalties
over my mother and father.
Here you are.

26:12.790 --> 26:14.630
You're on, Uncle Jack.

26:18.950 --> 26:24.030
Honey, a long time ago,
I fought oil fires for a living too.

26:24.030 --> 26:28.350
Your dad and I were, well,
just like he and Greg are now.

26:28.430 --> 26:31.590
We were coming back
from a job in Indonesia,

26:31.710 --> 26:33.510
and we stopped off
in San Francisco.

26:33.590 --> 26:36.590
Chance had promised
some gal a fur coat,

26:36.670 --> 26:39.350
and he went to Randolph's
to buy it.

26:39.470 --> 26:41.750
I never did know
what happened to that fur coat.

26:41.870 --> 26:46.350
But two weeks later he showed up
here in Houston...
married to your mother.

26:46.350 --> 26:49.710
I knew from the start
our work terrified her.

26:49.830 --> 26:56.630
But she wouldn't let on to Chance,
and she wouldn't let me tell him.
Then you came along.

26:56.710 --> 27:01.030
And two weeks later,
I broke my back in a fire.

27:01.150 --> 27:03.350
The next few months,

27:03.430 --> 27:06.590
every job Chance went on
was a nightmare for her.

27:06.710 --> 27:09.750
She couldn't hide it anymore
and he couldn't quit,

27:09.750 --> 27:13.110
so she packed up and took
you back to San Francisco.

27:13.230 --> 27:16.110
Then how is it
I remember him?

27:16.110 --> 27:18.670
I must've been
five or six.

27:18.790 --> 27:20.590
That's right, honey.

27:20.710 --> 27:22.990
Then went back together
a half dozen times,

27:23.110 --> 27:25.390
but your mother could never
get over her fear.

27:25.510 --> 27:28.270
And your father knew
if she was to be happy,

27:28.270 --> 27:30.190
he'd have to stay
out of her life.

27:30.190 --> 27:33.750
So, that's the decision
he made for them.

27:36.910 --> 27:39.990
I understand a lot of things
about my mother now.

27:41.990 --> 27:44.790
I don't think she's ever been
out of love with him.

27:44.870 --> 27:48.110
Oh, well, I know he's never
been out of love with her.

27:48.110 --> 27:50.830
But still, he couldn't
give up his work.

27:50.910 --> 27:54.070
Honey, since my accident,

27:54.150 --> 27:56.750
I've been extremely lucky
in everything I've touched.

27:56.870 --> 28:00.390
But I'm just another Texas oil man
with his own building.

28:00.510 --> 28:02.710
Your father is
one of a kind.

28:02.710 --> 28:05.470
The best there is
in what he does.

28:06.830 --> 28:09.230
No man can walk away
from that.

28:11.510 --> 28:15.830
Thank you for
bringing me here.
You're welcome.

28:17.070 --> 28:19.790
How do you think he'll feel
about seeing me?

28:19.870 --> 28:23.150
Am I going to remind him of something
he'd rather leave forgotten?

28:23.230 --> 28:27.430
Forgotten? Honey, he's followed
you two like a hungry man.

28:27.550 --> 28:30.310
Through me, the San Francisco papers,
any way he could.

28:30.430 --> 28:32.990
I remember once
when you had the chicken pox,

28:33.110 --> 28:37.790
I had to stop him from flying
in half the Mayo Clinic.
I'll be damned.

28:37.910 --> 28:39.710
I've known this man
for ten years,

28:39.830 --> 28:42.590
and he's kept all this
under wraps.

28:42.590 --> 28:44.990
The investments
you made for me.

28:46.550 --> 28:49.030
The money came from
my father, didn't it?

28:49.110 --> 28:51.990
Yes, but you're not
to tell him I told you.

28:53.830 --> 28:58.030
Tish, it's been a day for you.
Why don't we all turn in? Greg?

29:10.710 --> 29:13.470
I'll check with the hospital
and keep you both posted.

29:13.590 --> 29:17.430
Your room is the first door on the left
at the top of the stairs.

29:17.430 --> 29:19.230
Just buzz Hernando
if you need anything.

29:19.350 --> 29:21.630
And if you'll knock
on my door in the morning,

29:21.710 --> 29:23.630
I'll buy you a cup
of coffee.

29:23.630 --> 29:26.350
- Thanks for everything.
- Good night, dear.

29:26.430 --> 29:28.910
- You too, Greg.
- Good night, Tish.

29:58.470 --> 30:01.830
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

30:01.830 --> 30:03.750
I'm Letitia Buckman.

30:03.750 --> 30:08.070
Oh, well, I'm Irene Foster.
The boys told me you were in town.

30:08.070 --> 30:09.950
They're back here.

30:15.910 --> 30:17.750
- Hi.
- Hi.

30:17.830 --> 30:19.670
- Hello, there.
- What a surprise.

30:19.750 --> 30:22.230
A business office.
Fine thing.

30:22.230 --> 30:24.150
Won't they let you
play with them?

30:24.150 --> 30:27.510
No, I'm into them for too much.
This is my game.

30:27.510 --> 30:30.110
- It's an exhausting business.
- Mmm.

30:30.190 --> 30:32.030
I'll bring some coffee.

30:32.110 --> 30:34.230
I just missed you
at the hospital.

30:34.230 --> 30:36.910
You were pulling out
as I was pulling in.

30:36.910 --> 30:39.230
- How good is Dr. Forrest?
- The best.

30:39.310 --> 30:42.670
I wonder. He tells me
Dad is fine,

30:42.750 --> 30:46.230
then he tells me it's no use
coming back for another week.

30:46.230 --> 30:48.150
He told you he was
gonna keep him sedated.

30:48.150 --> 30:51.110
It's the only way the doc can keep
from tangling with your old man.

30:51.190 --> 30:54.470
That reminds me.
I have a message from Uncle Jack.

30:54.550 --> 30:56.750
He's gonna take the blame
for my being here.

30:56.870 --> 31:00.110
- Lomax doesn't have to...
- Buy it, will ya?

31:00.230 --> 31:02.630
These are incredible!

31:02.630 --> 31:04.630
Is this what they're
really like?

31:04.750 --> 31:06.750
Kind of, yeah,
but no two are ever the same.

31:06.830 --> 31:09.510
Come here.
I want to show you something.

31:12.510 --> 31:14.310
This is where your dad
signs the checks,

31:14.430 --> 31:17.190
when he gets around
to it.

31:17.310 --> 31:19.230
From an African
tribal chief.

31:19.310 --> 31:22.190
His presentation speech
lasted over an hour.

31:22.190 --> 31:25.630
What he was saying was that to him,
Chance hung the moon.

31:29.870 --> 31:31.670
My work room.

31:31.790 --> 31:35.790
Except Chance uses it for
all the junk he collects.

31:35.790 --> 31:38.310
This one's oddball.
Mexico.

31:38.390 --> 31:41.950
That's live steam shooting up
under 6,000 pounds pressure.

31:42.030 --> 31:45.470
- No oil?
- They drilled into an underground volcano.

31:45.590 --> 31:47.590
Chance capped that one
by himself.

31:47.710 --> 31:51.150
- Where were you?
- In Nigeria on another job.

31:51.230 --> 31:53.910
Chance talked them into
building a power plant.

31:54.030 --> 31:59.790
Says it'll supply eight Mexican towns
for the next hundred years.
That's wonderful.

32:01.230 --> 32:02.950
Coffee's ready!

32:06.390 --> 32:08.790
Oh, here you are.

32:08.870 --> 32:12.350
Thank you.

32:12.430 --> 32:15.230
Buckman Company.

32:15.230 --> 32:19.070
From another African chief?
No, a witch doctor.

32:19.070 --> 32:22.590
I told Chance he ought to wear it.
It improves his looks.

32:22.710 --> 32:25.110
Just a moment.
It's Chuck Barton.

32:28.630 --> 32:31.030
Yeah, Chuck.
Greg Parker.

32:31.150 --> 32:35.470
Yeah.

32:35.470 --> 32:39.110
Chance can't make it.
Joe and I'll handle it.
Be there in two hours.

32:39.190 --> 32:42.950
Barton number 7,
Landry Parrish, Louisiana.

32:43.030 --> 32:45.710
Irene, pull the file on...

32:45.830 --> 32:48.590
Tri-State Acadia
Parrish fire.

32:57.990 --> 33:01.150
- We'll take the chopper, George.
- Right.

33:01.270 --> 33:02.790
What's he looking at?

33:02.790 --> 33:06.150
We keep a record of equipment we've
had manufactured all over the world.

33:06.230 --> 33:09.030
- That's the list nearest this job.
- Is it a big fire?

33:09.110 --> 33:11.030
Big or small,
it's money.

33:11.150 --> 33:14.670
I'll go with you.

33:14.790 --> 33:18.790
Uh, I don't think your father
would want that. What do you say, Joe?

33:18.790 --> 33:22.070
No, Chance... He's kinda
funny that way, huh, Irene?

33:22.150 --> 33:26.750
Oh, well, he does get
definite ideas about things. No!

33:29.150 --> 33:30.990
Sorry, Tish.

33:31.070 --> 33:35.870
Call Tri-State and tell them to roll
the entire list over to Barton 7.
Wait a minute.

33:35.990 --> 33:39.510
- How far is New Orleans from this fire?
- About 90 miles.

33:39.510 --> 33:41.630
I was thinking of going
to New Orleans, anyway.

33:41.710 --> 33:44.430
I thought I could visit a friend
until I can see my father.

33:44.510 --> 33:48.430
All right, you can use the jet.
Irene'll arrange it.

33:51.430 --> 33:54.590
Ten thousand scattered
and fifteen miles. Thanks.

33:54.670 --> 33:57.470
- No sweat. We're all clear.
- Bye-bye.

33:57.550 --> 33:59.390
Joe, George.

33:59.470 --> 34:01.270
Greg.

34:04.630 --> 34:06.550
See ya when we get back.

34:12.989 --> 34:15.590
Would you, uh,

34:15.590 --> 34:19.030
like to let your friend
know you're coming?

34:19.030 --> 34:20.949
Yes, I would.

34:27.190 --> 34:29.949
Operator?
New Orleans information.

34:30.070 --> 34:34.870
Miss Joan Gilman,
112 Elm Street.

34:52.989 --> 34:54.909
- Hi!
- Hi!

34:54.909 --> 34:57.390
- Come on!
- What's the big rush?

34:57.470 --> 34:59.310
I got to get me
a rent car.

34:59.390 --> 35:01.310
- You going to a fire or something?
- Yes.

35:01.430 --> 35:03.630
- What for?
- I met a fireman.

35:14.350 --> 35:18.190
- Hi, George.
- How'd you get here?

35:18.310 --> 35:20.710
In this.

35:20.790 --> 35:25.030
Would you tell this officer
that I am Chance Buckman's daughter?

35:25.030 --> 35:26.950
She sure is.

35:26.950 --> 35:28.830
I'm sorry, Miss.

35:28.830 --> 35:31.230
If I was to let everybody through,
there'd be a thousand sightseers.

35:31.350 --> 35:34.790
I saw them. It took me hours
to get through the traffic.

35:36.790 --> 35:41.710
- Where are Greg and Joe?
- At the motel before the turn-off.
You passed it comin' in.

35:41.710 --> 35:44.390
What're they doing there?
Is anything wrong?

35:44.470 --> 35:50.350
No. Greg's a little unhappy about the
water supply, but it's being worked on.
Thank you.

36:05.950 --> 36:08.830
- Hi, Joe.
- How'd you get here?

36:08.830 --> 36:10.750
In that.

36:12.190 --> 36:14.590
Tish, what the hell
are you doin' here?

36:14.590 --> 36:17.470
At least you didn't ask me
how I got here.

36:17.550 --> 36:21.990
I thought I'd drop by
and see what was going on,
as long as I was this close.

36:22.070 --> 36:24.870
New Orleans is
a hundred miles from here!

36:24.950 --> 36:27.430
It's practically
in the neighborhood.

36:30.510 --> 36:33.470
You know, you ought to
put on a little weight.

36:34.830 --> 36:38.270
Don't bother.
I'm family.

36:38.270 --> 36:40.190
I take it you've been
to the fire.

36:40.310 --> 36:42.990
- Yes.
- Then you've seen about everything there is.

36:43.070 --> 36:44.910
What about your
putting it out?

36:44.990 --> 36:48.270
The drilling contractor has to rerig his
pumps. He won't be ready 'til tomorrow.

36:48.270 --> 36:51.430
I don't mind waiting.
There are lots of rooms.

36:51.510 --> 36:53.910
The manager's complaining
about you stopping traffic.

36:54.030 --> 36:57.350
- You're murdering his business.
- What happened to your friend?

36:57.470 --> 37:02.070
I picked a terrible time to visit her.
She's got the mumps.

37:02.150 --> 37:04.550
Don't let it scare you.
I didn't go near her.

37:04.550 --> 37:06.950
I'd appreciate it if you
went back to New Orleans...

37:06.950 --> 37:09.150
and grabbed the first plane
to Houston.

37:09.270 --> 37:13.190
I'd appreciate knowing why
everyone is so concerned...
about my being at a fire.

37:13.270 --> 37:15.110
Upsetting my father?
Why should it?

37:15.190 --> 37:17.990
- Well...
- Well, what?

37:18.070 --> 37:19.910
Well, uh, uh...

37:19.990 --> 37:23.070
Nothing. It's just...
you shouldn't be here.

37:23.150 --> 37:26.990
Well, I am, so let's
take it from there.
There's nothing to do here.

37:26.990 --> 37:29.390
We're just sittin' around
playin' gin.

37:29.390 --> 37:33.030
Lovely. You two look
like pigeons.

37:33.150 --> 37:35.070
What're you playin' for?

38:00.190 --> 38:01.990
It's out! It's out!

38:04.030 --> 38:06.150
Oh, no!

38:07.950 --> 38:10.150
Oh, my God!

38:35.110 --> 38:37.030
Uh-oh.

38:43.910 --> 38:45.830
What's the matter?
We wake you up?

38:45.830 --> 38:48.790
You knew I wanted to be here
when you put the fire out.

38:48.910 --> 38:51.990
We didn't put the fire out. We missed.
We gotta go for another shot.

38:52.070 --> 38:54.390
Good. Then
I made it after all.

38:54.470 --> 38:58.190
Tish, they know you're
Chance's daughter.

38:58.310 --> 39:01.390
Now, what's the matter with you,
bargin' in here with no clothes on?

39:01.470 --> 39:05.590
- You worried about my reputation?
- Yes.
Yes, I am, damn it!

39:05.590 --> 39:07.910
Greg, that's very sweet,

39:07.910 --> 39:11.350
but you might as well begin
to learn when you've lost an argument.

39:11.350 --> 39:13.550
And you've lost this one.

39:13.630 --> 39:15.470
I'm staying right here.

39:21.030 --> 39:22.750
- You didn't!
- Yes, I did!

39:22.750 --> 39:24.790
- Without asking me?
- You were in no shape.

39:24.790 --> 39:27.270
Which makes it all the more
stupid your bringing her here.

39:27.270 --> 39:29.190
I'm gonna get out.
Where are my clothes?

39:29.270 --> 39:32.350
Go ahead, act like an idiot.
She's right outside.

39:58.350 --> 40:01.110
The last time I saw you,
you...

40:01.230 --> 40:03.230
your two front teeth
were missing.

40:03.310 --> 40:08.110
I think you bought me a little
live monkey that squeaked.

40:09.190 --> 40:11.110
And it bit too.

40:11.110 --> 40:15.910
So I bought you a toy one, and you were
just as happy because it squeaked also.

40:15.990 --> 40:20.110
I wasn't really,
but Mother wouldn't let me tell you.

40:22.230 --> 40:24.630
All that hollerin'
you were doing,

40:24.630 --> 40:26.910
you're still angry about
my being here?

40:27.030 --> 40:29.910
Worth gettin' all
busted up for.

40:31.990 --> 40:33.910
Speaking of your mother,

40:34.030 --> 40:36.790
what does she say
about your coming here?

40:36.910 --> 40:39.310
She's in Europe.
She doesn't know.

40:39.390 --> 40:41.190
Let's keep it that way.

40:41.310 --> 40:45.030
We can't.
Too much has happened.

40:45.150 --> 40:46.950
What?

40:47.070 --> 40:50.990
- For starters, I went to a fire and...
- You went to an oil fire?

40:50.990 --> 40:55.510
Yes, I went to
an oil fire with Greg.
Pardon me. Greg!

40:57.510 --> 41:00.790
- What the hell?
- You took my daughter to an oil fire.

41:00.790 --> 41:03.950
- What's wrong with that?
- I'll tell you what's wrong with it.

41:04.030 --> 41:07.190
Every time he takes a girl...
Every time...

41:07.310 --> 41:10.670
- Whenever he...
- Sputter away, Dad.

41:10.670 --> 41:12.870
We got married yesterday.

41:15.750 --> 41:17.550
Well, say somethin',
you big ape.

41:17.670 --> 41:19.470
Aren't you gonna
congratulate them?

41:19.590 --> 41:22.270
It was the cutest
Cajun church in Louisiana.

41:22.350 --> 41:25.630
Maybe if it hadn't been there,
we would have waited.

41:25.790 --> 41:29.350
I'd like to talk
to Tish alone.

41:29.430 --> 41:31.950
Doesn't this concern
the three of us?

41:31.950 --> 41:33.750
Greg, please.

41:47.470 --> 41:50.630
- Tish, I, uh...
- I know what you're going to say.

41:50.750 --> 41:55.630
Can I really love a man if
I've known him five days?
Well, I do love him,

41:55.630 --> 41:57.550
and there's not the slightest doubt
that he loves me.

41:57.550 --> 42:00.710
If you're going to bring up about you
and Mother, it won't happen to me.

42:00.790 --> 42:02.630
Uncle Jack told me
about it.

42:02.710 --> 42:05.910
I've been to a fire.
I didn't fall apart.

42:05.990 --> 42:08.750
You know, I'm not
all Mother's daughter.

42:08.870 --> 42:10.670
I'm your daughter too.

42:10.790 --> 42:13.070
Doesn't that make
the difference?

42:14.150 --> 42:16.230
Yeah. Yeah!

42:17.990 --> 42:22.310
What're you standing out there for?
Come on in.

42:22.310 --> 42:25.270
- Congratulations.
- Thank you very much.

42:25.350 --> 42:28.150
And I wish you
everything wonderful, Tish.

42:28.150 --> 42:30.070
Everything in the world.

42:30.070 --> 42:31.990
I got a lot of champagne.

42:31.990 --> 42:34.070
Great!
Let's go celebrate.

42:34.070 --> 42:36.670
I'll drink to that.
Wait'll I get my coat.

42:36.670 --> 42:39.830
But, Mr. Buckman,
I don't know about this.

42:39.950 --> 42:43.390
I do, Mrs. Thistlewait.
I'm a new father-in-law.

42:46.070 --> 42:49.150
- I did leave messages.
- Well, find him.

42:49.230 --> 42:51.750
Okay, I'll try again.

42:53.270 --> 42:56.990
Oh, we've been trying
to reach you all afternoon.

42:57.110 --> 42:59.390
I figured it was
a riot call.

43:07.470 --> 43:09.270
Bourbon for me.

43:11.510 --> 43:14.470
You picked a hell of a day
to be out of the office.

43:14.550 --> 43:17.350
I know. Madelyn is
flying in from Paris.

43:17.430 --> 43:19.270
Tish is meeting her plane
about now.

43:19.350 --> 43:21.270
Simmer down.
Pour me my drink.

43:21.270 --> 43:23.470
If you knew,
why didn't you head her off?

43:23.470 --> 43:25.870
They don't call passengers
to the phone.

43:25.870 --> 43:29.030
- How's your arm?
- Fine, fine.

43:29.150 --> 43:32.510
You know who she's gonna
blame for this marriage... me!

43:32.590 --> 43:35.470
I'll testify you didn't
hold a gun on 'em.

43:35.550 --> 43:39.110
Cut out the jokes, and help me
figure out how to handle this.

43:39.110 --> 43:41.990
I am. You're all having
dinner together.

43:42.070 --> 43:45.430
I made a reservation at the club.
Greg is coming to pick you up.

43:45.430 --> 43:50.990
- You've got a suit here, haven't you?
- You're going, aren't you?
Definitely not.

43:51.110 --> 43:54.350
This is something for
the four of you to hash out.

43:54.470 --> 43:59.750
Madelyn is staying at my place.
I'll get the rundown later.
You're not scared, are you?

43:59.750 --> 44:02.310
You're damn right I am.

44:04.910 --> 44:09.590
Who's got the most
butterflies, you or me?
Mine are dive bombers.

44:09.710 --> 44:12.790
I never met a mother-in-law before,
at least not one of my own.

44:12.790 --> 44:16.590
If you're comin' to me
for advice, I'm a dry hole.

44:28.710 --> 44:30.510
Mother.

44:39.910 --> 44:41.830
- Hi.
- Hi.

44:41.830 --> 44:44.710
- Mother, this is Greg.
- How do you do, Mrs. Buckman?

44:44.710 --> 44:47.110
Please call me Madelyn.
How are you, Chance?

44:47.110 --> 44:49.990
Fine. You're looking well.
Sit down.

44:55.470 --> 44:59.270
Is it still gin and tonic?

44:59.270 --> 45:01.870
Yes, and tonight
I think several.

45:01.990 --> 45:04.750
- Scotch on the rocks for me.
- Yes, ma'am.

45:07.230 --> 45:10.030
Well, Tish told me
how this all came about.

45:10.110 --> 45:13.270
As usual, you came out
of it smiling and happy.

45:13.270 --> 45:15.670
I think we all did.

45:15.670 --> 45:17.590
I understand your first
comment about me...

45:17.590 --> 45:19.510
was that I had to be
a complete bitch.

45:19.510 --> 45:23.150
- I was kind of mad and excited.
- Relax, both of you.

45:23.270 --> 45:26.430
- Mother thought it was funny.
- You did?

45:26.510 --> 45:28.830
I like a man who's honest
and outspoken.

45:28.910 --> 45:32.070
Well, obviously
I was dead wrong.

45:32.070 --> 45:36.790
Well, I want to wish
you two all the...

45:36.870 --> 45:38.990
happiness in the world.

45:38.990 --> 45:41.390
- I'll drink to that.
- Thank you.

45:42.910 --> 45:44.750
How are you
on the dance floor?

45:44.830 --> 45:48.190
Ummm. I knew you'd get
around to that.

45:48.190 --> 45:50.790
No matter what,
I won't throw you back.

46:11.310 --> 46:14.110
They're gonna have
a lot of fun, those two.

46:14.110 --> 46:18.390
I hope so. Am I taking this
better than you thought?

46:18.510 --> 46:20.910
Oh, I knew you'd
take it all right.

46:20.910 --> 46:24.830
You never saw anybody as enthused
as that Tish. She's out house hunting...

46:24.910 --> 46:28.670
- We might as well face it, Chance.
- Face what?

46:28.750 --> 46:32.390
Every time he leaves her,
she's going to go through hell.

46:32.510 --> 46:35.950
- She says she's going with him.
- That makes it worse.

46:35.950 --> 46:39.790
I watched them put Jack into
a wheelchair for the rest of his life.

46:39.790 --> 46:42.590
I ran because I couldn't bear
the thought of them doing it to you.

46:42.670 --> 46:45.950
- I don't want Tish...
- Tish isn't you, Madelyn!

46:46.030 --> 46:48.710
She thinks she can make it,
and I think so too.

46:48.790 --> 46:51.310
Besides, there's not
a damn thing we can do about it.

46:51.390 --> 46:54.750
Give 'em a break,
will ya?

46:54.870 --> 46:58.590
- I haven't any alternative, have I?
- No.

47:00.990 --> 47:02.910
You're still wearing it?

47:04.830 --> 47:09.150
I heard you were...
engaged a couple of times.

47:09.230 --> 47:12.390
Well, never seriously enough
to go through with it.

47:12.390 --> 47:16.150
Well, I'd say they were two
very unlucky fellas.

47:17.790 --> 47:20.070
Madelyn, when you came
down those stairs, this...

47:20.150 --> 47:24.390
Why don't you order me a drink
and tell me all the Houston gossip.

47:24.470 --> 47:26.590
They don't let me in
on the gossip,

47:26.590 --> 47:29.070
and you don't need
another drink.

47:52.390 --> 47:54.230
Isn't it beautiful?

47:54.310 --> 47:55.670
It's lovely.

47:55.750 --> 48:00.150
- That settles it, Greg. Let's buy it.
- Seems we've decided.

48:00.150 --> 48:02.350
I wish we could
move into it right now.

48:02.470 --> 48:06.310
I don't think the people
living there now would appreciate that.

48:11.190 --> 48:13.190
Yeah, Irene.

48:13.190 --> 48:15.870
I can't hear you.

48:15.990 --> 48:17.630
No, I still
can't hear you.

48:17.710 --> 48:21.630
- What's the matter?
- Phone's out of whack.
Call her from my place.

48:21.630 --> 48:24.030
We'll talk to you from Chance's.

48:33.350 --> 48:35.270
Let's go.

48:39.110 --> 48:41.030
Yeah, Irene.

48:41.030 --> 48:44.070
Oh, I guess we can get
started about 7:00.

48:44.190 --> 48:46.590
Oh, tell George
he can come along.

48:46.670 --> 48:48.510
Right.

48:49.750 --> 48:52.910
- Where is it?
- Canada, outside of Calgary.

48:52.910 --> 48:55.790
- Lightning cracked a control head.
- Why George?

48:55.790 --> 48:57.710
We're not taking
the chopper.

48:57.710 --> 49:01.350
Well, he's been wanting to break in
for a long time. I think he's ready.

49:01.430 --> 49:04.710
- You're not going along.
- What do you mean?

49:04.710 --> 49:09.790
Well, a fella just married
usually goes on a honeymoon.
You got a bum arm.

49:09.790 --> 49:12.070
Ah, that's
the doctor's idea.

49:12.190 --> 49:15.630
I think Canada is
a perfect place for a honeymoon.

49:15.630 --> 49:17.550
You serving
breakfast?

49:17.550 --> 49:19.470
Yeah.

49:19.470 --> 49:23.030
Oh, Mother, here's the key
to Uncle Jack's apartment.

49:23.110 --> 49:24.950
See you in the morning.

49:28.590 --> 49:32.710
At least you tried to give them
a decent honeymoon. Thank you for that.

49:34.830 --> 49:36.630
You gonna use that key?

49:37.870 --> 49:41.350
I won't if you ask me not to,
and you know it.

49:41.430 --> 49:43.350
Please don't.

49:46.030 --> 49:48.350
How about a nightcap?

49:50.270 --> 49:52.070
One.

51:35.550 --> 51:39.110
- You all right?
- What's with you? I saw that iron falling.

51:39.110 --> 51:42.470
- Then why didn't you move?
- I was movin' when you booted me.

51:42.470 --> 51:44.870
George, Joe'll take in
the nitro.

51:44.870 --> 51:46.790
- Right.
- That's my job.

51:46.870 --> 51:51.950
- Take a breather.
- Who brings in the new control heads?
George.

51:51.950 --> 51:54.830
Chance, I'm okay.
I can do my job.

51:54.950 --> 51:57.990
All right, do it.

52:11.630 --> 52:13.430
Headstrong.

52:19.470 --> 52:21.390
What'd you do,
cross your skis?

52:21.510 --> 52:24.270
Tish, I want you to
get back. Way back.

53:06.750 --> 53:08.590
I'll tap you.

53:11.670 --> 53:13.590
Call.

53:16.350 --> 53:19.990
Whew. You sure inherited
your old man's luck at cards.

53:20.110 --> 53:22.510
I'm just a better
player than you.

53:22.510 --> 53:25.870
Let me show her how
an expert handles those pasteboards.

53:25.870 --> 53:28.150
Try not to get
wiped out, expert.

53:41.870 --> 53:44.150
Our Houston E.T.A.
is 6:30.

53:44.150 --> 53:46.870
Uh-huh.

53:46.950 --> 53:48.950
You got something
on your mind.

53:48.950 --> 53:52.110
- Let's have it. - Stop looking out
for me because I'm your son-in-law.

53:52.230 --> 53:54.990
What left field
did that come out of?

53:55.110 --> 53:58.670
Kicking me in the guts like a loco mule,
and that bilge about my taking a breather?

53:58.750 --> 54:01.510
I'd have done that for George
or Joe or anybody.

54:01.630 --> 54:03.430
- You sure of that?
- I'm damn sure.

54:03.550 --> 54:06.310
And while we're on
that son-in-law bit,

54:06.430 --> 54:09.190
what's the idea of bringing
Tish to these fires?

54:09.310 --> 54:12.550
It's lousy food and about
as much privacy as an outhouse.

54:12.670 --> 54:14.750
That's no place
to bring your wife.

54:14.870 --> 54:17.550
She'll go wherever she wants to go
because she is my wife.

54:17.630 --> 54:19.350
She's my daughter too,
bub!

54:19.470 --> 54:23.590
She's got your luck at cards, and she
inherited some of your guts. Are you satisfied?

54:23.590 --> 54:26.470
If that's the way
you two want it, fine,

54:26.550 --> 54:29.070
but just get off my back,
that's all.

54:38.150 --> 54:40.470
I was in San Francisco
yesterday.

54:40.550 --> 54:42.390
Had lunch with Madelyn.

54:42.470 --> 54:44.790
- How is she?
- Oh, fine.

54:44.870 --> 54:47.950
The usual questions,
all boiling down to one:

54:47.950 --> 54:50.830
How is Tish bearing up
after ten fires?

54:50.830 --> 54:54.670
Why ask you? Greg and Tish are
up there with her, aren't they?

54:54.670 --> 54:57.550
She thinks Tish is
putting on an act,

54:57.630 --> 54:59.950
and she really don't
believe me.

55:00.790 --> 55:03.670
How is Tish
at the fires, Chance?

55:03.670 --> 55:06.550
Well, she seems to be
bearing up all right.

55:06.630 --> 55:09.630
And you?

55:11.150 --> 55:14.230
Does there look like there's
something wrong with me?

55:14.310 --> 55:19.790
Madelyn was hoping you might finally
see things from her point of view.

55:21.790 --> 55:24.590
You gonna shoot
or stand there all day?

55:29.270 --> 55:32.270
Yes, Irene.

55:32.350 --> 55:34.190
Buckman here.

55:35.310 --> 55:37.510
Yes. Oh?

55:38.950 --> 55:42.710
I think we could get there
by day after tomorrow.

55:42.790 --> 55:46.910
We'll cable you
the flight number.
Fine. Thank you.

55:47.030 --> 55:49.630
Long haul, huh?

55:49.710 --> 55:52.670
Malaya, above Penang.

55:52.790 --> 55:56.310
Poison well fire.
Hydrogen sulfate.

55:56.430 --> 55:58.230
Is Irene
calling Greg?

55:59.310 --> 56:01.510
Well, I...

56:01.590 --> 56:03.430
didn't tell her not to.

56:03.510 --> 56:05.350
Uh-huh.

56:15.590 --> 56:17.430
Marker!

56:19.150 --> 56:21.630
There's a call for you
in the snack bar.

56:21.750 --> 56:23.750
Okay. See you
on the green.

57:03.070 --> 57:05.950
I just scuffed a ball,
Mother, that's all.

57:07.590 --> 57:10.470
Don't read anything into it
that isn't there.

57:10.470 --> 57:12.390
You've been smoking more,

57:12.390 --> 57:15.630
and I notice you've been
drinking a little faster lately.

57:15.750 --> 57:18.710
Don't read anything into that
that isn't there either.

57:18.790 --> 57:23.230
I'd rather have one week or one day
or one hour of happiness with Greg...

57:23.310 --> 57:26.110
than the years of
loneliness you've had.

58:17.510 --> 58:19.310
- Chance! Greg!
- Amal!

58:19.430 --> 58:22.950
- Good to see you, Amal.
- Not half as good as it is to see you two.

58:22.950 --> 58:25.070
- We're in trouble.
- Tish.

58:26.310 --> 58:28.350
This is Amal Bokru.
My wife.

58:28.350 --> 58:30.270
- My daughter.
- My father-in-law.

58:30.270 --> 58:32.630
- And my pleasure.
- How do you do?

58:32.630 --> 58:36.390
- Welcome to Malaya, Mrs. Parker.
- Thank you.
Congratulations, Greg.

58:36.470 --> 58:40.230
You must be tired. Your rooms are ready,
but they'll need your passports at the desk.

58:40.230 --> 58:43.110
I have them.
I'll take care of it.

58:43.190 --> 58:45.510
How do we stand
on equipment?

58:45.590 --> 58:48.390
Everything you cabled for is being
trucked into the jungle.

58:48.470 --> 58:51.750
- Most of it should be there by now.
- What about the gas masks?

58:51.750 --> 58:54.630
The army was a little upset
you would not use theirs.

58:54.630 --> 58:57.470
For a sour well we want
equipment we're used to.

58:57.470 --> 58:59.870
Poison well?
I never heard of such a thing.

58:59.870 --> 59:03.630
Eight men were in the field house
when it caught fire 100 yards away.

59:03.630 --> 59:06.790
- Seven are dead, and the eighth is blind.
- Yeah.

59:06.790 --> 59:10.150
- Have you got a chopper for us?
- The military's flying one in.

59:10.150 --> 59:14.550
- It can't be here until late tomorrow.
- We'll drive out in the morning.

59:14.670 --> 59:16.470
Amal!

59:16.590 --> 59:19.830
- Hello, Joe.
- Hi, Amal. This is George Harris.

59:19.910 --> 59:22.990
- How you been?
- Fine, thank you.

59:25.030 --> 59:27.230
I was in Sumatra...

59:27.310 --> 59:30.110
and someone remembered
I'd worked with you before.

59:30.190 --> 59:32.990
That's how I volunteered
to assist you in this fire.

59:33.070 --> 59:35.070
It came at a most
inconvenient time.

59:35.190 --> 59:37.950
Sounds like you got something
going on in Sumatra...

59:38.070 --> 59:39.990
besides
the oil business.

59:39.990 --> 59:42.750
I'm afraid I'm getting in the way
of an interesting conversation.

59:42.870 --> 59:46.110
Since you men are going gambling
at Madame Loo's and I'm not invited,

59:46.190 --> 59:49.070
I'll look for a shop
and spend some of your money.

59:49.070 --> 59:50.990
How did you know
about Madame Loo's?

59:50.990 --> 59:53.870
People have to talk about
something when they're married.

59:53.870 --> 59:56.750
Besides, I bought the cigarettes
you smuggled in for her.

59:56.750 --> 59:58.670
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

59:58.670 --> 01:00:01.550
We're getting up at daybreak.
Don't be too late.

01:00:01.550 --> 01:00:03.950
Tish, you're not
going to this fire.

01:00:03.950 --> 01:00:07.790
- The jungle is no place for you.
- The conditions are extremely primitive.

01:00:07.790 --> 01:00:10.190
You'd better
sit this one out.

01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:12.590
A rejected woman
needs mad money.

01:00:15.150 --> 01:00:17.870
- Good night. - Good
night. - Good night.

01:00:22.070 --> 01:00:25.710
Exactly what did you
tell her about Madame Loo?

01:00:25.830 --> 01:00:28.990
Only that she's 80 years old,
weighs 300 pounds...

01:00:28.990 --> 01:00:32.030
and is one of
your oldest friends.

01:00:32.030 --> 01:00:34.630
Yeah.

01:00:34.750 --> 01:00:36.470
Chance!

01:00:43.470 --> 01:00:45.390
- Chance!
- Loozie-Loo!

01:00:45.390 --> 01:00:47.790
- Ha ha!
- Bend down here.

01:00:49.230 --> 01:00:51.150
- What's new?
- Nothing.

01:00:51.230 --> 01:00:54.030
When Amal phoned
you were coming... Wham!

01:00:54.110 --> 01:00:56.390
My heart goes
as always.

01:00:56.510 --> 01:00:58.510
- Greg.
- Hi, Loo.

01:00:58.630 --> 01:01:00.430
- Joe! Ohh!
- Hi!

01:01:00.430 --> 01:01:05.310
- And this is George.
- Me too?
Oh, sure!

01:01:05.430 --> 01:01:07.230
You did not forget.

01:01:07.350 --> 01:01:09.150
American cigarettes!

01:01:09.270 --> 01:01:11.070
Oh, but I worry.

01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:14.350
He might think these are
the only reasons I love him.

01:01:14.350 --> 01:01:17.230
Come. I saved you
the big table.

01:01:18.670 --> 01:01:20.470
Married, baby.

01:01:31.790 --> 01:01:33.630
Greg! My Greg!

01:01:33.710 --> 01:01:35.710
Gum Drop!

01:01:48.310 --> 01:01:51.830
Oh.
Amal did not tell us that.

01:01:51.950 --> 01:01:53.750
You love her?

01:01:53.870 --> 01:01:55.670
That's it, Gum Drop.

01:02:04.310 --> 01:02:06.150
What's the matter?

01:02:06.230 --> 01:02:09.790
That thing with Gum Drop didn't look
like any "Poor Butterfly" act to me.

01:02:09.870 --> 01:02:12.750
You dirty old den mother. She's gonna
name her first baby after me.

01:02:12.750 --> 01:02:14.750
- Ohh!
- And another thing.

01:02:14.750 --> 01:02:17.910
If I don't want Tish
at an oil fire, I'll tell her.

01:02:17.910 --> 01:02:19.350
- Well, tell her.
- I did!

01:02:19.470 --> 01:02:22.430
Greg, this is
the Australian crew working the well.

01:02:22.550 --> 01:02:24.910
Chance Buckman, gentlemen.
Greg Parker.

01:02:25.030 --> 01:02:27.790
Hiya, mate.
Jim Hatch, driller.

01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:31.150
When are you fellas
due back at the well?

01:02:31.270 --> 01:02:34.150
Early tomorrow morning.
We're on day tower. Why?

01:02:34.230 --> 01:02:37.870
- If you keep on this sauce,
you won't be much use to me.

01:02:37.990 --> 01:02:40.350
Mr. Buckman, we're gentlemen who pleasure
ourselves in drinking as we see fit.

01:02:40.470 --> 01:02:42.870
Mr. Buckman, we're gentlemen who pleasure
ourselves in drinking as we see fit.

01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:44.790
- Right, mates?
- Right. - Right.

01:02:44.870 --> 01:02:46.790
What do you think
about that?

01:02:46.790 --> 01:02:49.270
Very simple.
There's one boss.

01:03:26.710 --> 01:03:28.510
He's all mine!

01:03:40.510 --> 01:03:42.310
He's all mine!

01:03:53.430 --> 01:03:55.270
- Now?
- Now!

01:03:59.110 --> 01:04:01.870
Big Australian oaf!
Look what you've done to my place!

01:04:01.990 --> 01:04:03.790
We had a little
to do with it.

01:04:03.910 --> 01:04:06.670
- Add it up, lady. I'll pay ya.
- The boss pays.

01:04:06.790 --> 01:04:11.470
You get your crew out there
in the morning, sober and on time.

01:04:11.590 --> 01:04:14.070
- Right?
- Right.

01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:16.470
Come on, you blokes.
Let's go.

01:04:16.550 --> 01:04:22.230
- I'll buy you a drink.
- Let the dirty old den mother buy the drinks.
I love you, Mother.

01:04:22.310 --> 01:04:24.710
- He's all mine!
- The war's over!

01:05:01.270 --> 01:05:03.070
Good morning.

01:05:06.990 --> 01:05:08.910
What happened to you?

01:05:08.910 --> 01:05:11.790
- Ran into them firefighters last night.
- How'd it end?

01:05:11.790 --> 01:05:13.510
- Friendly.
- Good.

01:05:15.150 --> 01:05:16.990
What a hairy beast!

01:05:18.510 --> 01:05:20.350
Hiya, Mr. Buckman.

01:05:20.430 --> 01:05:22.910
- I made it on time.
- "Fair dinkem," digger.

01:05:22.910 --> 01:05:25.030
Gentlemen,
this is Dr. Songla...

01:05:25.150 --> 01:05:26.950
and the field superintendent
Harry York.

01:05:27.030 --> 01:05:29.830
- Glad to have you here.
- We didn't think we were gonna make it.

01:05:29.910 --> 01:05:34.990
- We spent most of our time airborne on these roads.
- They wash out when it rains.

01:05:34.990 --> 01:05:38.950
- It rains nearly every day.
- You don't intend to bring the nitro in over them.

01:05:39.030 --> 01:05:40.870
- Well, I, uh...
- Don't try it.

01:05:40.950 --> 01:05:43.550
Radio Penang and have it
brought in by copter.

01:05:43.550 --> 01:05:48.070
I see the pumps got here.
How soon before you'll have 'em rigged?

01:05:48.150 --> 01:05:51.110
- Should be tomorrow.
- Any pattern to the wind current?

01:05:51.230 --> 01:05:53.510
- Shifting all the time.
- They're murder.

01:05:53.630 --> 01:05:55.910
That's why
everyone's been moved back this far.

01:05:56.030 --> 01:05:58.790
The fumes are reaching the field house,
so we had to abandon it.

01:05:58.870 --> 01:06:00.990
That's where
the men were killed.

01:06:01.110 --> 01:06:03.990
This side of
the yellow flags is safe.

01:06:03.990 --> 01:06:06.830
Beyond them, gas masks
have to be worn.

01:06:06.830 --> 01:06:09.710
That's why we brought
oxygen masks and tanks.

01:06:09.710 --> 01:06:12.590
That way we can work
in half-hour shifts.

01:06:56.990 --> 01:06:58.830
You bring the nitro?

01:06:58.910 --> 01:07:02.270
Yeah, and I'd very much
appreciate if you'd unload it.

01:07:04.870 --> 01:07:06.870
What are you doing here?

01:07:06.990 --> 01:07:08.910
You'll never guess
what happened.

01:07:08.910 --> 01:07:10.830
What do you mean,
what happened?

01:07:10.830 --> 01:07:13.230
I found the greatest
delicatessen in Penang.

01:07:13.230 --> 01:07:15.150
Bagels,
smoked salmon and...

01:07:15.150 --> 01:07:18.790
- One of the lost tribes, I guess.
- It's not funny, Tish.

01:07:18.870 --> 01:07:21.670
That's some greeting.
I thought I'd bring you fellas lunch.

01:07:21.750 --> 01:07:24.150
Lunch? In a chopper
full of nitro glycerine?

01:07:24.150 --> 01:07:27.030
If it hadn't been for me,
the nitro might not have gotten here.

01:07:27.030 --> 01:07:29.710
No one wanted to fly it 'til
I found Lieutenant Singh.

01:07:29.710 --> 01:07:33.470
- When I tell you I don't want you here, I mean...
- Look out!

01:07:49.550 --> 01:07:51.470
Get him out of here!

01:07:51.470 --> 01:07:54.150
Easy!

01:07:54.150 --> 01:07:56.070
Watch his legs!

01:07:56.070 --> 01:07:58.470
Watch it, watch it.

01:08:13.830 --> 01:08:17.550
- He's dead.
- When did he take off his gas mask?

01:08:17.670 --> 01:08:21.310
A couple of seconds before we did.
We were in the safe zone.

01:08:22.830 --> 01:08:25.149
Move back
the warning flags.

01:08:25.149 --> 01:08:27.069
Gimme a hand.

01:08:34.270 --> 01:08:36.470
What is it?

01:08:36.550 --> 01:08:39.430
It's a poison gas well,
Tish.

01:08:39.510 --> 01:08:41.430
You didn't
mention that.

01:08:41.430 --> 01:08:43.270
You're going back
on this copter.

01:08:43.350 --> 01:08:45.950
No, I'm not.
I was going, but I'm not.

01:08:48.149 --> 01:08:52.109
We promised to level with each other,
not keep anything back.

01:08:53.710 --> 01:08:55.630
She's staying,
Chance.

01:08:55.630 --> 01:08:59.870
- I'm not interested in any damn fool promises you...
- Dad, I'm staying.

01:11:26.390 --> 01:11:28.510
Get the hell outta here!

01:11:28.510 --> 01:11:32.430
I'm gonna get something
to pry you loose.

01:12:22.870 --> 01:12:24.710
Doctor, come on.

01:12:24.790 --> 01:12:26.630
Hurry!

01:13:56.190 --> 01:13:59.750
Easy, Greg. You're gonna make it.
You're gonna make it.

01:14:33.910 --> 01:14:37.150
Greg? I'd like to
talk to ya.

01:14:49.510 --> 01:14:52.390
I'm going to
dissolve this outfit.

01:14:52.390 --> 01:14:55.270
Now, look, I know something's
been bugging you since Malaya.

01:14:55.270 --> 01:14:57.390
You wanna talk about it,
let's talk.

01:14:57.470 --> 01:15:00.270
I've made up my mind.
There's nothing to talk about.

01:15:00.350 --> 01:15:04.110
You haven't made up your mind,
you've lost it.

01:15:10.710 --> 01:15:13.510
Tish?
Come on in here.

01:15:20.790 --> 01:15:22.990
Sit down.

01:15:23.110 --> 01:15:26.550
I've decided it's time
to quit this business.

01:15:26.630 --> 01:15:30.190
I'm going with Lomax Oil,
and there's a spot for Greg.

01:15:30.270 --> 01:15:33.550
I want him to come with me.
How do you feel about it?

01:15:33.630 --> 01:15:36.510
- It depends how Greg feels.
- I'd go right up the wall.

01:15:36.510 --> 01:15:38.630
I'll stick with the job
I know best.

01:15:38.710 --> 01:15:42.350
What job? I guess you
didn't hear me. This outfit's folded.

01:15:42.350 --> 01:15:46.670
Then I'll start my own or take over this
one. Just tell me how you want it paid off.

01:15:46.670 --> 01:15:49.070
Look, the agreement
you two made...

01:15:49.070 --> 01:15:50.990
to level with each other...

01:15:50.990 --> 01:15:55.230
I saw the look on your face when we
dragged Greg out of that last one.

01:15:55.310 --> 01:15:59.350
Tell him how you feel about it,
how you honestly feel.

01:16:00.390 --> 01:16:02.790
Greg can pay all cash,
if you want.

01:16:02.790 --> 01:16:06.630
Maybe it's a dirty trick, but I've got
the money you sent to me over the years.

01:16:06.710 --> 01:16:10.950
- Wait a minute, your money's got nothing to do with this.
- Forget it.

01:16:11.030 --> 01:16:12.870
You can have it.

01:16:12.950 --> 01:16:14.790
Call it
a wedding present.

01:16:14.870 --> 01:16:18.430
I don't want any gifts!
I'll pay you twice what it's worth!

01:16:18.510 --> 01:16:21.030
Greg.

01:16:21.110 --> 01:16:22.950
- Chance.
- Yeah?

01:16:24.270 --> 01:16:27.550
How do you want it?
Do we stay with Greg or not?

01:16:27.630 --> 01:16:31.190
That's a fool question. But there's
one thing I'm worried about.

01:16:31.270 --> 01:16:34.350
He's not too smart about
which fires to walk away from.

01:16:34.430 --> 01:16:36.750
- I read ya.
- Thanks.

01:16:39.030 --> 01:16:40.870
Well,

01:16:40.950 --> 01:16:42.790
looks like we...

01:16:42.870 --> 01:16:44.790
got a new boss.

01:17:07.430 --> 01:17:10.110
Next item
on the agenda...

01:17:10.230 --> 01:17:14.430
is to finalize what color
or combinations of colors...

01:17:14.550 --> 01:17:17.990
should be used to redo
the restrooms in our gas stations.

01:17:18.070 --> 01:17:20.870
Since we have
over 1,400 stations,

01:17:20.950 --> 01:17:23.470
this is a pretty
weighty matter.

01:17:23.550 --> 01:17:25.670
Lipman here
of the art department...

01:17:25.750 --> 01:17:28.430
has had the research section
make a survey to determine...

01:17:28.550 --> 01:17:32.070
the public's preference
in restroom decor.

01:17:32.190 --> 01:17:34.670
He'll fill us in
on their findings.

01:17:39.550 --> 01:17:41.390
This soft willow green,
gentlemen,

01:17:41.470 --> 01:17:43.390
is preferred
by people of all ages,

01:17:43.390 --> 01:17:45.310
according to
our survey.

01:17:45.310 --> 01:17:47.350
They find it
soothing and restful.

01:17:47.430 --> 01:17:49.830
Yet the very
chic women...

01:17:49.830 --> 01:17:53.070
seem to prefer
this lovely royal blue.

01:17:53.070 --> 01:17:55.470
However, research
points out...

01:17:55.470 --> 01:17:58.470
a strong psychological
advantage to this color,

01:17:58.550 --> 01:18:01.350
which we'll call
flaming heart red.

01:18:01.430 --> 01:18:05.190
It tends to make people spend
less time in the restroom,

01:18:05.270 --> 01:18:08.030
drives them out for the
convenience of the next customer.

01:18:08.150 --> 01:18:13.310
Gentlemen, it's up to you.
Which would you prefer?
Flaming heart red,

01:18:13.430 --> 01:18:16.310
the lovely
royal blue...

01:18:16.390 --> 01:18:18.390
or the soft
willow green?

01:18:34.430 --> 01:18:37.590
What are we arguing about? She's
cratered and the casing's shattered.

01:18:37.590 --> 01:18:40.830
The only thing you can do with that fire
is kill it with a relief hole,

01:18:40.830 --> 01:18:42.750
then go drill yourself
another well.

01:18:42.750 --> 01:18:44.670
That one's
down 12,000 feet.

01:18:44.670 --> 01:18:46.710
It'll cost us
over 300,000.

01:18:46.710 --> 01:18:48.510
Plus my bill
for wasting my time.

01:18:48.630 --> 01:18:51.390
I doubt Chance Buckman
would say just write it off.

01:18:51.510 --> 01:18:53.990
Well, you just call him
and ask him.

01:19:06.070 --> 01:19:11.830
It is the unanimous opinion of the
committee that we abandon the negotiations.
Why?

01:19:13.350 --> 01:19:17.110
Mr. Buckman, since I've chaired
the finance committee...

01:19:17.190 --> 01:19:19.990
we've made it policy
never to enter a joint venture...

01:19:20.070 --> 01:19:22.550
unless we control
the drilling operations.

01:19:22.670 --> 01:19:25.270
Now, the Jansen brothers
have always...

01:19:25.350 --> 01:19:27.150
Yeah?

01:19:27.270 --> 01:19:29.550
I know you're
not to be interrupted,

01:19:29.670 --> 01:19:34.550
but it's Mr. Mullen of the Mullen
Oil Company calling Mr. Buckman.
He says it's urgent.

01:19:35.990 --> 01:19:37.830
Yeah, Mike?

01:19:39.830 --> 01:19:41.750
Uh-huh.

01:19:41.750 --> 01:19:45.110
Well, had the well cratered
before they called Greg in?

01:19:46.150 --> 01:19:47.990
Greg must be gettin' soft.

01:19:48.070 --> 01:19:52.470
You'd called me out there, I'd have punched
your field superintendent in the nose.

01:19:52.590 --> 01:19:55.190
Yeah, well, nice talkin'
to you too, Mike.

01:19:55.270 --> 01:19:57.670
Regards to your wife.
Right.

01:19:57.750 --> 01:19:59.670
Greg walk away from one?

01:19:59.670 --> 01:20:02.550
Nothing to walk away from.
It was impossible.

01:20:02.550 --> 01:20:05.910
Thompson, I don't know too much
about policy around here,

01:20:05.910 --> 01:20:09.830
but the Jansen brothers were smellin'
out oil before you were born.

01:20:09.950 --> 01:20:11.950
Check the fields
they've brought in.

01:20:11.950 --> 01:20:16.950
You can call it luck or "seat of your
pants" or whatever. They find oil.

01:20:16.950 --> 01:20:18.870
And speaking of policy,
Thompson,

01:20:18.870 --> 01:20:22.030
the policy of an oil company
should be to find oil.

01:20:22.110 --> 01:20:26.350
- They're most difficult men. We just don't...
- Chance talks their language.

01:20:26.430 --> 01:20:28.350
He'll take care of it.

01:20:28.470 --> 01:20:30.190
Yes, sir.

01:20:30.270 --> 01:20:33.070
Well, I guess that
kind of wraps it up.

01:20:42.270 --> 01:20:45.630
Where are we gonna have dinner tonight,
your place or mine?

01:20:45.630 --> 01:20:48.990
- Why don't we go to the club for a change?
- No, I got another meeting.

01:20:49.070 --> 01:20:51.870
Fiscal stuff.
You'd hate it.

01:20:51.950 --> 01:20:55.030
Go up and have a drink.
I'll call you when I can.

01:20:55.110 --> 01:20:57.030
Good idea.

01:21:12.750 --> 01:21:14.670
Well, I'll be damned.

01:21:14.670 --> 01:21:18.430
That's probably the most
romantic greeting a woman ever received.

01:21:18.430 --> 01:21:22.270
But it still goes.
I'll be damned.

01:21:23.390 --> 01:21:26.190
Obviously Jack didn't
tell you I was here.

01:21:26.270 --> 01:21:30.510
Oh, I was in hopes he didn't know,
but that's the pixie in him.

01:21:30.590 --> 01:21:34.990
He likes to spring surprises, and this
is one that I'll hold still for.

01:21:35.110 --> 01:21:37.990
And just in case
you might ask me for dinner,

01:21:37.990 --> 01:21:39.790
Hernando's gone
to the market...

01:21:39.910 --> 01:21:44.030
and I'm charged with fixing Senor Buckman
his long-hard- day-at-the-office drink.

01:21:44.110 --> 01:21:46.510
Do you remember
what it is?

01:21:53.630 --> 01:21:56.510
Jack tells me you're doing
just great down there.

01:21:56.510 --> 01:21:59.350
Well, it's not as dull
as I thought it'd be.

01:21:59.470 --> 01:22:02.230
- As a matter of fact, it's pretty interesting.
- That's wonderful.

01:22:02.350 --> 01:22:06.350
I suppose Jack also told you
that Tish and Greg...

01:22:06.470 --> 01:22:09.230
would probably be back
in time for dinner.

01:22:09.350 --> 01:22:11.350
I'll check with Irene.

01:22:11.470 --> 01:22:14.030
Chance, hang up.

01:22:14.030 --> 01:22:18.350
They're not coming back. They're
on their way to Sun Valley for skiing.

01:22:18.350 --> 01:22:20.270
What happened?

01:22:20.270 --> 01:22:22.670
Well, it was my idea,
actually.

01:22:22.670 --> 01:22:27.470
There are times when children
shouldn't be underfoot,
nor should business.

01:22:27.470 --> 01:22:31.790
When I left the store today, I simply
told them I was taking some time off.

01:22:31.790 --> 01:22:34.550
Didn't even tell them
where I was going.

01:22:37.910 --> 01:22:40.790
How's your time for
the next couple of weeks?

01:22:43.190 --> 01:22:46.070
Looks like I'm gonna be
booked up solid.

01:22:46.070 --> 01:22:47.990
Welcome home.

01:22:55.390 --> 01:22:58.270
Nah.
Fill that, Joe.

01:22:59.510 --> 01:23:02.270
Look out
for the Venezuelan.

01:23:02.390 --> 01:23:04.470
Possible straight.

01:23:04.590 --> 01:23:06.510
Pair of cowboys.

01:23:06.510 --> 01:23:08.910
- Hello?
- Well, cost you five.

01:23:08.910 --> 01:23:11.190
- I'll go along.
- Â¿Quien habla?

01:23:11.190 --> 01:23:13.030
Un momento,
por favor.

01:23:13.110 --> 01:23:17.070
The call is for
Senora Parker.
Senora Parker.

01:23:17.070 --> 01:23:21.830
It is San Francisco.
A Mrs. Buckman is calling.
Hi, Mother.

01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:25.190
Hello, Tish?
Where in Venezuela are you?

01:23:25.190 --> 01:23:29.030
I've never heard of it. We've been
trying to get you on the phone for hours.

01:23:29.030 --> 01:23:30.950
We're flying down
to Houston tonight...

01:23:30.950 --> 01:23:33.070
Oh.
Well, your father.

01:23:33.150 --> 01:23:35.950
Yes, well, it took
a bit of female doing,

01:23:36.030 --> 01:23:37.870
but with one thing
and another,

01:23:37.950 --> 01:23:42.270
I finally convinced him I should
leave the store and come live with him.

01:23:42.350 --> 01:23:44.750
Of course, legitimately.

01:23:44.870 --> 01:23:47.630
We flipped a coin and he won.
We're getting married in Houston.

01:23:47.750 --> 01:23:50.790
Greg, Dad and Mother
are going to get married.

01:23:53.310 --> 01:23:56.670
When? You can't.
Not 'til we get back.

01:23:56.670 --> 01:23:59.710
A daughter has a right to be
at her parents' wedding.

01:23:59.830 --> 01:24:03.270
She wants us to wait for...
Here, talk to your father.

01:24:03.390 --> 01:24:05.190
Hello.

01:24:05.310 --> 01:24:08.070
Yeah, well, I kinda
like the idea too.

01:24:08.150 --> 01:24:10.950
How long are you two
gonna be down there?

01:24:11.030 --> 01:24:14.310
How long will we be here?
I'll let you talk to Greg.

01:24:16.030 --> 01:24:18.830
Congratulations.
About time you did something right.

01:24:18.910 --> 01:24:21.670
We should wrap it up
in a few more days.

01:24:21.790 --> 01:24:24.550
We'll start clearing
the junk off tomorrow.

01:24:24.670 --> 01:24:27.910
I know how long we've been here, but
there's guerrilla activity in the hills.

01:24:28.030 --> 01:24:30.310
They've been shootin' up
our water lines.

01:24:30.430 --> 01:24:32.830
No, no, no,
the army's here now...

01:24:32.830 --> 01:24:37.430
and I've got Colonel Valdez' solemn oath
there'll be no more trouble.

01:24:37.510 --> 01:24:40.590
Yeah. Yeah. Madelyn wants
to talk to you again.

01:24:40.670 --> 01:24:42.510
Yes, Mother?

01:24:43.750 --> 01:24:47.310
We'll let you know as soon
as we're going to leave.

01:24:47.390 --> 01:24:50.350
I love you, and I'm very happy
for you both.

01:24:50.470 --> 01:24:52.270
Bye-bye.

01:24:57.470 --> 01:25:01.310
My father is finally going to
marry my mother. Isn't that great?

01:25:01.390 --> 01:25:03.590
That is very nice.

01:25:05.630 --> 01:25:08.870
- Oh, let's see. Where were we?
- It's to you, Tish.

01:25:12.310 --> 01:25:14.230
Down!

01:25:26.630 --> 01:25:28.550
Second me.

01:27:13.150 --> 01:27:16.910
- Colonel, Mr. Chapman and Senor Caldes.
- How do you do?

01:27:16.990 --> 01:27:18.830
Please come in.

01:27:26.870 --> 01:27:29.190
Tanto gusto,
Senora Parker.

01:27:29.270 --> 01:27:31.110
This is Senor Parker.

01:27:31.190 --> 01:27:33.030
His Excellency Senor Caldes,
Minister of Interior.

01:27:33.110 --> 01:27:35.030
- Senor.
- How do you do?

01:27:35.030 --> 01:27:36.870
- General Lopez.
- Tanto gusto, senor.

01:27:36.950 --> 01:27:39.750
- Senor Chapman of your United States embassy.
- How do you do?

01:27:39.830 --> 01:27:42.790
I was just going to make some coffee.
Would you like some?

01:27:42.790 --> 01:27:46.630
- Senor, we have seen the fires. It is most distressing.
- Yeah.

01:27:46.630 --> 01:27:49.510
But will you be able to
bring them under control?

01:27:49.510 --> 01:27:52.310
The end wells we can handle
one at a time.

01:27:52.390 --> 01:27:55.190
The center three are so closely spaced
they'll have to be put out simultaneously,

01:27:55.270 --> 01:27:57.110
or else they'll
reignite each other.

01:27:57.190 --> 01:27:59.670
- Can it be done?
- We've never tried it before.

01:27:59.670 --> 01:28:02.550
Senor Parker, this oil field
is of great importance...

01:28:02.550 --> 01:28:06.390
to the economy
of my country,
but even that is secondary.

01:28:06.390 --> 01:28:08.310
The clandestine guerrilla
radio is boasting...

01:28:08.310 --> 01:28:10.230
of what they accomplished
last night...

01:28:10.230 --> 01:28:13.030
and claim the fires
will never be put out.

01:28:13.030 --> 01:28:17.710
They'll turn it into a propaganda field
day to sell sabotage all over South America.

01:28:17.710 --> 01:28:20.310
I won't even begin the operation
if they're shooting at us.

01:28:20.390 --> 01:28:22.790
Three more companies of men
have been ordered here.

01:28:22.870 --> 01:28:25.950
We will blanket the area
with troops if necessary, senor.

01:28:26.070 --> 01:28:28.830
I've been authorized by the State
Department to offer every assistance.

01:28:28.950 --> 01:28:31.910
Anything you need
will be made available.

01:28:31.990 --> 01:28:33.910
The one thing I really need
you can't give me.

01:28:34.870 --> 01:28:39.750
Why don't you gentlemen have some
coffee. I want to talk to my wife.
Tish.

01:28:44.670 --> 01:28:47.430
Tish, I don't care if they've
brought in the whole army.

01:28:47.550 --> 01:28:51.190
I still worry about you. I want you
to fly back to Caracas with them.

01:28:51.190 --> 01:28:54.070
I'll phone you every night.
I promise.

01:28:56.750 --> 01:28:59.510
It'll just take me
a minute to pack.

01:28:59.630 --> 01:29:05.270
Do you have to go back and talk to them,
or can you come and talk to me?
They can wait.

01:29:35.590 --> 01:29:39.710
What's all the mystery? Why do you
wait 'til you get here to call me?

01:29:39.710 --> 01:29:42.590
And why don't you want
your father to know you're here?

01:29:42.590 --> 01:29:46.990
Because I have to talk to you, Mother,
before I see him. Greg's in trouble.

01:29:48.230 --> 01:29:50.070
Oh.

01:29:50.150 --> 01:29:53.510
He's on a job I don't think
he can handle without Dad.

01:29:53.630 --> 01:29:57.750
I know what this means to you.
That's why I had to see you alone first.

01:29:57.750 --> 01:30:00.990
Why couldn't they both
have just been insurance salesmen?

01:30:01.110 --> 01:30:04.550
Please understand.
I've got to ask him.

01:30:04.630 --> 01:30:07.430
Is this trouble anything
the State Department is aware of?

01:30:07.510 --> 01:30:09.350
- Yes.
- Then he probably knows already.

01:30:09.430 --> 01:30:13.470
When I left, he was talking with two men who
had just flown in from the State Department.

01:30:13.550 --> 01:30:16.350
Being told about it
is one thing.

01:30:16.430 --> 01:30:20.950
- I've got to know his answer.
- Well, surely you can't doubt what that'll be.

01:30:22.470 --> 01:30:26.590
Tish, surely you don't think
I'd try to stop him.

01:30:26.710 --> 01:30:29.750
Forgive me that, please.

01:30:29.870 --> 01:30:33.790
I dreaded coming here.
I dread asking him.

01:30:33.910 --> 01:30:36.870
Most of all, I dread
what this does to you.

01:30:38.390 --> 01:30:41.190
Let's handle
one dread at a time.

01:30:41.270 --> 01:30:43.790
You don't have to ask him;
I will.

01:30:43.870 --> 01:30:48.270
It might be as well if we never tell
your father of this conversation.

01:30:48.270 --> 01:30:51.150
Or Greg. He doesn't
even know I'm here.

01:30:51.150 --> 01:30:53.150
He thinks I'm in Caracas.

01:30:54.590 --> 01:30:57.390
Mother, there's
a plane back in an hour.

01:31:10.910 --> 01:31:13.710
Why didn't you tell me
you were in trouble?

01:31:13.790 --> 01:31:16.590
Why do I have to find out about it
from the State Department?

01:31:16.670 --> 01:31:20.790
The hell you're not!
Nobody ever tackled that kind of a job.

01:31:20.870 --> 01:31:24.630
What size, uh, control heads
did you order?

01:31:24.710 --> 01:31:27.990
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.

01:31:28.070 --> 01:31:30.870
It's Greg.
He has a little problem.

01:31:30.950 --> 01:31:32.790
Yes.

01:31:32.870 --> 01:31:37.190
Well, the Air Force has put a National
Guard cargo plane at my disposal.

01:31:37.270 --> 01:31:39.190
Of course
I'm coming with it.

01:31:39.190 --> 01:31:41.390
I'll be there
in the morning.

01:31:41.510 --> 01:31:45.230
I just hope you haven't loused things up
too much. Right.

01:31:46.990 --> 01:31:49.950
Well, at least
he had the good sense...

01:31:50.030 --> 01:31:51.950
to get Tish out of there.

01:31:52.070 --> 01:31:54.070
- She's in Caracas.
- Oh.

01:31:55.110 --> 01:31:57.990
Madelyn, this is one
I've got to go to.

01:31:57.990 --> 01:32:01.070
I know you do.
It involves Tish and Greg.

01:32:01.070 --> 01:32:04.910
Well, we'd better face this
all at once.

01:32:04.990 --> 01:32:09.230
This was bound to happen sooner or later
and it'll happen again,

01:32:09.310 --> 01:32:12.670
and each time I'll...
I'll go.

01:32:15.070 --> 01:32:17.190
Thank you for being
honest with me.

01:32:17.270 --> 01:32:20.270
Well, where does that
leave us, honey?

01:32:21.510 --> 01:32:23.510
I don't know.

01:32:23.510 --> 01:32:25.430
I honestly don't know.

01:32:25.430 --> 01:32:27.830
You gonna be here
when I get back?

01:32:27.830 --> 01:32:32.430
The only plan I have at the moment is to
go to Tish. She could use some company.

01:32:33.950 --> 01:32:35.870
Yeah.

01:32:38.750 --> 01:32:43.470
Irene, call Bill Hansen.
Have him break the jet out of mothballs.

01:32:43.550 --> 01:32:46.350
He's taking Mrs. Buckman
to Caracas.

01:32:46.430 --> 01:32:50.350
Phone back
when the plane's ready.
Hmm?

01:32:50.470 --> 01:32:55.150
Well, if five fires is
your idea of fun, you're nuts.

01:32:55.270 --> 01:32:58.230
Sure, sure,
I'll send back pictures.

01:32:58.310 --> 01:33:00.630
Color pictures.
Right.

01:33:02.150 --> 01:33:05.430
They'll let you know
when the plane's ready.

01:33:05.510 --> 01:33:08.310
I, uh, I guess
I'd better get packed.

01:33:09.910 --> 01:33:12.790
Do you want your hard hat sombrero
packed, or will you pick one up...

01:33:12.910 --> 01:33:14.710
- Pack it!
- Bueno.

01:34:25.310 --> 01:34:27.150
Joe!

01:34:27.230 --> 01:34:29.990
It's about time you got back
to earning an honest living.

01:34:30.110 --> 01:34:32.870
If you think I'm gonna say
it's a pleasure to be here, forget it.

01:34:32.990 --> 01:34:35.470
- Hi, boss.
- George, nice to see ya.

01:34:39.230 --> 01:34:41.030
Hi, boss.

01:34:45.910 --> 01:34:50.230
Couldn't be lousier timing for you
and Madelyn, could it? I'm sorry.

01:34:50.230 --> 01:34:53.710
Forget it. It's probably
kinder that she finds out now...

01:34:53.710 --> 01:34:57.830
Let's skip talking about it.
I spent a lot of your money.

01:34:57.910 --> 01:35:00.870
What did you do, buy up
all the control heads in Houston?

01:35:00.990 --> 01:35:04.430
This far away from supplies,
you get all the spares you can.

01:35:04.550 --> 01:35:08.070
This is Col. Valdez, Chance. He's in
charge of keeping us from getting shot.

01:35:08.190 --> 01:35:10.590
I hope you do
a good job, Colonel.

01:35:10.590 --> 01:35:13.150
If I do not, you'll have
my profound apologies.

01:35:13.270 --> 01:35:17.110
The longer you guys stand there, the
longer it's gonna take to unload this thing.

01:35:17.110 --> 01:35:19.190
Right, Joe.

01:35:27.350 --> 01:35:29.270
The guerrillas could still
pot shot the water lines.

01:35:29.270 --> 01:35:34.070
I had that dredged
and filled for emergency water.
Give us time to run.

01:35:34.150 --> 01:35:36.750
I sincerely doubt
there could be such an emergency.

01:35:36.870 --> 01:35:40.710
The entire area is patrolled
from the ground and the air.

01:35:40.790 --> 01:35:43.270
Well, you'll have to bear
with our worryin', Colonel.

01:35:43.390 --> 01:35:45.670
We stay alive by being
scared to death.

01:35:45.790 --> 01:35:48.470
- I do not believe this is ever so.
- Don't bet on it.

01:35:48.550 --> 01:35:50.390
What's first,
Greg?

01:35:50.470 --> 01:35:53.830
To clear off all five,
we'll kill the ones at each end,

01:35:53.830 --> 01:35:57.550
and then worry about how we knock off
the middle three at the same time.

01:35:57.670 --> 01:35:59.950
I'll need that third
boom arm.

01:36:00.070 --> 01:36:02.670
The hang-up's gonna be
gettin' that nitro...

01:36:02.750 --> 01:36:04.950
into the middle three
at the same instant.

01:36:04.950 --> 01:36:07.910
Given any thought to using
those end two for practice?

01:36:07.910 --> 01:36:12.070
Blowin' 'em up
at the same time?
Welcome back, Chance.

01:36:14.910 --> 01:36:17.310
- Here you are.
- Gracias, senora.

01:36:38.710 --> 01:36:42.750
Just one cheat,
and I could win this one.
I won't tell.

01:36:42.750 --> 01:36:47.430
I never cheat
when I'm keeping score.

01:36:47.550 --> 01:36:52.150
Did you know that there are over
60 different games of solitaire?

01:36:52.230 --> 01:36:55.590
According to Hoyle,
it's called patience,

01:36:55.670 --> 01:36:58.670
and there are 102 games.

01:36:58.750 --> 01:37:01.150
I played them all.

01:37:01.150 --> 01:37:03.830
It's just being stuck
so far away.

01:37:03.950 --> 01:37:06.030
I'm not like this
when I'm there with Greg.

01:37:06.150 --> 01:37:08.550
It never worked either way
with me.

01:37:08.550 --> 01:37:10.830
But that was a long time ago.

01:37:12.870 --> 01:37:17.070
Do you want me to take another shower
so you can call Bill Hansen again?

01:37:18.790 --> 01:37:22.750
- I haven't been fooling you at all, have I?
- What did Bill say?

01:37:22.830 --> 01:37:25.310
The area's under martial law.

01:37:25.430 --> 01:37:29.150
No one is allowed in
except military or emergency personnel.

01:37:29.270 --> 01:37:32.510
Bill's tried everyone
except the president.

01:37:32.510 --> 01:37:34.430
So have I.

01:37:35.950 --> 01:37:39.230
Well, Jack Lomax
is flying in.

01:37:39.310 --> 01:37:41.830
He knows the president.

01:37:58.990 --> 01:38:00.990
Forty-three, Joe!

01:38:01.110 --> 01:38:03.390
Forty-three
on the money!

01:38:03.510 --> 01:38:05.870
You can start loading
the nitro, Chance.

01:38:05.990 --> 01:38:08.390
We got both barrels into the fire
at the same split second.

01:38:08.390 --> 01:38:10.310
- Right, George?
- Right.

01:38:10.310 --> 01:38:13.070
- How many runs?
- Fourteen times from 75 yards out.

01:38:13.190 --> 01:38:15.110
The throttle governor wasn't working
'til the last run.

01:38:15.190 --> 01:38:17.590
You only got it on
the button for one run?

01:38:17.670 --> 01:38:21.430
You couldn't time it
any closer.
Try a half dozen more.

01:38:21.510 --> 01:38:25.550
When you get it on the button
every time, then we'll load the nitro.

01:38:25.630 --> 01:38:27.750
Yeah, you're right.
Let's go.

01:38:28.510 --> 01:38:30.350
Zamora!

01:38:33.590 --> 01:38:35.510
Tell them they're
bringing in the wrong stuff.

01:38:35.510 --> 01:38:39.950
I want only the boxes marked
with a red circle.
Es todo lo mismo.

01:38:40.030 --> 01:38:41.870
He says it's all
nitroglycerin.

01:38:41.950 --> 01:38:46.270
The boxes that're marked,
we've checked for exact mixture.

01:38:46.350 --> 01:38:48.750
That's what we'll need if we're gonna
blow two wells at the same time.

01:38:48.870 --> 01:38:50.670
Explain that to them.

01:38:50.790 --> 01:38:54.030
Quiero no mas, las cajas que tienen
la marca del curculo rojo.

01:38:54.110 --> 01:38:56.710
Es mucho peligro
cargar esto.

01:38:56.830 --> 01:38:59.870
They have never worked
with nitroglycerin before.

01:38:59.870 --> 01:39:02.670
- They are not happy.
- I gathered that.

01:39:02.750 --> 01:39:06.990
- What's their bonus, double pay?
- Si, senor.

01:39:07.070 --> 01:39:11.390
Well, tell 'em from now on,
it's double-double.
That goes for you too.

01:39:11.470 --> 01:39:16.590
Tell them that, and call
your Caracas office and say I said so.

01:39:16.590 --> 01:39:19.910
Bueno.

01:40:09.430 --> 01:40:14.030
Unless somebody has
some questions,
I guess we're all set.

01:40:14.030 --> 01:40:16.990
Greg will raise the flag
for ready.

01:40:16.990 --> 01:40:19.190
When he drops it,
you start.

01:40:19.310 --> 01:40:22.070
If there's any reason to abort,
he'll raise it again.

01:40:22.150 --> 01:40:24.670
Otherwise, we follow
set procedure.

01:40:24.670 --> 01:40:27.150
- Is it understood?
- Check.

01:40:27.270 --> 01:40:29.070
Let's go.

01:41:50.030 --> 01:41:52.590
Go! Hit it!

01:42:02.870 --> 01:42:05.470
Couldn't be better!

01:43:15.870 --> 01:43:17.670
Hang onto the head!

01:43:17.750 --> 01:43:20.070
Grab hold!

01:43:27.550 --> 01:43:30.990
Ohh!

01:43:36.950 --> 01:43:39.350
- Get a jeep!
- There's one comin'!

01:43:39.350 --> 01:43:41.270
Lie still.

01:43:57.750 --> 01:44:00.910
Hold his leg.

01:44:01.030 --> 01:44:03.310
That tight enough?

01:44:03.430 --> 01:44:05.230
Yeah. That's good.

01:44:05.350 --> 01:44:07.830
Let's get him in there.

01:44:07.830 --> 01:44:09.750
Take his shoulders.

01:44:12.910 --> 01:44:14.750
Easy does it.

01:44:16.270 --> 01:44:18.110
All right.
Move out.

01:44:18.190 --> 01:44:21.430
Bring the dozers!
Lay some dirt on those loose fires!

01:44:21.550 --> 01:44:23.350
And fill up another
nitro barrel!

01:44:23.470 --> 01:44:26.350
- Did you get your well capped?
- Hell, no!

01:44:26.350 --> 01:44:29.230
Let's go finish it.
We'll come back to this one.

01:44:29.230 --> 01:44:31.630
Then we'll pay the army
a visit.

01:44:31.710 --> 01:44:35.550
I vote for paying the army
a visit now.
Not in the mood I'm in.

01:44:35.630 --> 01:44:38.030
They hang you for murder
down here.

01:44:39.390 --> 01:44:41.670
Si, si, bueno.

01:44:50.590 --> 01:44:55.790
Gentlemen, I told you I would
apologize, but that is not enough.

01:44:55.870 --> 01:44:57.710
I feel like cutting
my throat.

01:44:57.790 --> 01:45:01.150
A couple of hours ago,
I'd have given you the knife.

01:45:01.230 --> 01:45:03.470
My Spanish is just
good enough to gather...

01:45:03.470 --> 01:45:05.750
you're expecting more trouble
with the guerrillas.

01:45:05.750 --> 01:45:07.670
Yes, I must be
honest with you.

01:45:07.670 --> 01:45:11.430
That is why I have ordered two more companies
of infantry and three more helicopters.

01:45:11.510 --> 01:45:16.230
Huh. In the meantime, we're gonna try
and catch some shut eye.

01:45:16.310 --> 01:45:18.430
Let us know when
you feel it's safe.

01:45:18.430 --> 01:45:21.470
Have your men take the nitro
out of that shed...

01:45:21.590 --> 01:45:23.510
and bury it 'til
we need it.

01:45:23.510 --> 01:45:25.710
No sniper can get
that close.

01:45:25.790 --> 01:45:28.110
Two did.
Bury it!

01:45:28.190 --> 01:45:31.470
Whatever you people
wish done will be done.

01:45:31.550 --> 01:45:34.710
Uh, gentlemen?
Thank you very much.

01:45:34.830 --> 01:45:36.630
Forget it.

01:45:57.270 --> 01:45:59.070
Just a precaution,
senora.

01:45:59.190 --> 01:46:03.030
I understand there was some
guerrilla activity in the vicinity.

01:46:37.550 --> 01:46:39.470
What are you doin' here?

01:46:40.790 --> 01:46:43.190
Greg, what the hell
is Tish doin' here?

01:46:43.310 --> 01:46:45.990
- It was my idea.
- Somebody wake me up.

01:46:46.070 --> 01:46:49.430
Hold it, hold it!
Blame me. I brought 'em.

01:46:49.510 --> 01:46:51.350
If I wanted Tish here,
I'd have let her stay.

01:46:51.430 --> 01:46:53.470
Why do you think
I sent her back to Caracas?

01:46:53.550 --> 01:46:57.470
I didn't know you did. I was told
it was the army keeping her out.

01:46:57.590 --> 01:47:02.550
I guess I forgot
to mention about Greg.
Yeah, everybody did.

01:47:02.670 --> 01:47:04.950
Well, we left in such a hurry.

01:47:05.070 --> 01:47:07.750
And that's the way you're goin' back.
In such a hurry.

01:47:07.830 --> 01:47:10.710
- And no arguments.
- I am going to argue.

01:47:10.830 --> 01:47:14.070
- But in private, if you don't mind.
- Outside, lady.

01:47:16.390 --> 01:47:17.830
Hey, Joe!

01:47:17.910 --> 01:47:20.110
- Where can I get a cup of coffee?
- Uh, what?

01:47:20.110 --> 01:47:22.990
- Where's the coffee?
- In the field office.

01:47:22.990 --> 01:47:25.390
Jack, Madelyn!

01:47:25.470 --> 01:47:30.110
Never mind Madelyn.
Show me where the coffee is.
Okay.

01:47:38.070 --> 01:47:42.070
I'm reading a lot into your being here,
'cause I want to.

01:47:42.190 --> 01:47:46.030
Am I right?
Or is it only because Tish is here?

01:47:46.110 --> 01:47:47.950
Both.

01:47:51.190 --> 01:47:53.190
Oh.

01:47:53.310 --> 01:47:55.590
It was terrible
in Caracas.

01:47:55.710 --> 01:47:58.670
Tish said it would be better here.
I came to find out.

01:47:58.750 --> 01:48:02.710
I hate to say this,
but Greg's right.

01:48:02.710 --> 01:48:05.190
You should go back.

01:48:05.190 --> 01:48:07.110
All right.

01:48:07.190 --> 01:48:09.990
But if I do,
we'll never really know...

01:48:10.070 --> 01:48:13.150
if there's any hope
for us together, Chance.

01:48:13.230 --> 01:48:16.230
This fire is it for me,
it's the answer.

01:48:16.230 --> 01:48:20.910
I-I may fall apart and get
the screaming meemies, I don't know.

01:48:21.030 --> 01:48:22.830
But if I can take
this one...

01:48:22.950 --> 01:48:26.110
From what Tish tells me,
there'll never be a worse one.

01:48:26.190 --> 01:48:29.150
- I think it's worth it
for us to find out.

01:48:29.270 --> 01:48:31.550
It's settled.
They're going right back.

01:48:31.670 --> 01:48:34.550
- They're staying, at least Madelyn is.
- What's with you?

01:48:34.630 --> 01:48:37.030
- They're staying.
- Yowiee!

01:48:37.110 --> 01:48:39.990
I can't fight
all of ya.

01:48:40.110 --> 01:48:45.190
The detonator wires on all three
nitro drums lead back to this pit...

01:48:45.270 --> 01:48:47.950
where they're spliced in
to one plunger.

01:48:47.950 --> 01:48:51.910
Now, nothing triggers
'til that plunger is pushed.

01:48:51.910 --> 01:48:54.190
- You hope.
- Fervently.

01:48:54.310 --> 01:48:57.750
We knocked off the end two together.
This setup is better.

01:48:57.750 --> 01:49:01.110
The wire runs are closer
to being the same length.

01:49:01.110 --> 01:49:06.590
You tried two,
and you happened to come off lucky.
Now you're tackling three.

01:49:06.590 --> 01:49:10.390
All it takes is one
oversensitive blasting cap booster,

01:49:10.390 --> 01:49:13.110
a loose piece
of asbestos wrapping...

01:49:13.190 --> 01:49:15.990
or a hot spot burning
through an insulated wire,

01:49:16.070 --> 01:49:19.910
and any one of those drums can go off
prematurely, or not at all.

01:49:19.990 --> 01:49:21.830
Then where will you be?

01:49:21.910 --> 01:49:25.190
Depends on where you are
at the time.

01:49:25.190 --> 01:49:30.150
Jack, believe me, it's our firm
intention to double wrap the asbestos,

01:49:30.270 --> 01:49:32.550
to triple check
the booster caps,

01:49:32.550 --> 01:49:35.150
and if the insulated wire
does burn through,

01:49:35.230 --> 01:49:37.550
we'll sue
the manufacturer.

01:49:37.630 --> 01:49:40.710
You two are pretty
sure of yourselves.

01:49:40.710 --> 01:49:45.030
Not if somebody has
a better idea. Do you?

01:49:45.110 --> 01:49:46.950
No, I don't.

01:49:47.030 --> 01:49:49.350
You wanna know the real
reason I came down?

01:49:49.430 --> 01:49:52.430
To tell you this is one
you ought to back away from.

01:49:52.510 --> 01:49:57.310
You wanna know the real reason
I'm glad you're here?

01:49:57.390 --> 01:50:01.830
So I could ask you if you
wanted to handle this plunger.

01:50:04.110 --> 01:50:06.790
I'd like that very much.

01:50:18.390 --> 01:50:20.790
Esta libre todo.

01:50:20.910 --> 01:50:22.710
No hay peligro.

01:50:22.830 --> 01:50:25.390
All clear, Sr. Buckman.

01:50:25.390 --> 01:50:27.310
I read you.

01:50:54.830 --> 01:50:57.350
Looks like that practice
paid off.

01:51:02.990 --> 01:51:05.870
- Es un peligro, mi General.
- Bueno, vayan. Andele.

01:51:05.990 --> 01:51:07.990
Please, senoras.
Por favor.

01:51:34.150 --> 01:51:36.870
You're connected.
Hit it!

01:51:44.430 --> 01:51:46.750
Man, ain't it beautiful!

01:51:46.830 --> 01:51:48.630
Friend, we made it!

01:51:51.150 --> 01:51:55.270
What're we standing
around here for?
Right.

01:52:38.710 --> 01:52:41.990
Bueno. Si. Tambien.

01:52:42.070 --> 01:52:43.870
What is it?

01:52:43.990 --> 01:52:46.270
Radar picked up
guerrilla planes.

01:53:58.230 --> 01:53:59.830
Man!

01:54:28.790 --> 01:54:32.150
Don't say that to me again.
There are no excuses!

01:54:32.150 --> 01:54:34.470
- It was idiotic and irresponsible!
- Senora is overwrought.

01:54:34.470 --> 01:54:37.350
I am not overwrought!
I'm just plain damned mad!

01:54:37.350 --> 01:54:40.110
How dare you risk the lives
of men who come to help you?

01:54:40.230 --> 01:54:42.350
- They were in no danger.
- No danger?

01:54:42.430 --> 01:54:46.830
One bullet in those...
He knew the guerrillas had airplanes!
We didn't know.

01:54:46.830 --> 01:54:50.470
We suspected aircraft was made available
to them from outside the country,

01:54:50.590 --> 01:54:52.390
so we took every precaution.

01:54:52.510 --> 01:54:55.750
Five aircraft crossed our border,
but only two reached the area.

01:54:55.750 --> 01:54:59.790
Those are the two I'm talking about,
you... Say something!

01:54:59.870 --> 01:55:01.790
You're doing just fine.

01:55:01.910 --> 01:55:05.070
- Sr. Buckman...
- No apologies necessary, Colonel.

01:55:05.150 --> 01:55:08.230
Everything turned out
just great.

01:55:08.310 --> 01:55:10.510
Damned if I understand
your attitude.

01:55:10.630 --> 01:55:13.510
It's very simple.
You'll do.

01:55:16.390 --> 01:55:18.870
Well, what do you think?

01:55:18.870 --> 01:55:21.750
I think we ought to
get her a tin hat.

01:55:22.305 --> 01:55:28.832
