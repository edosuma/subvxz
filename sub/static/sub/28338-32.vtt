00:02.525 --> 00:04.355
[Marco groans]

00:08.525 --> 00:10.645
Huh? Star?

00:11.815 --> 00:13.565
[grunts, exclaims]

00:14.905 --> 00:16.605
[grunting]

00:21.145 --> 00:23.565
[cries out]

00:23.565 --> 00:25.145
[groans, gasps]

00:30.525 --> 00:32.695
How the heck did I end up
in the lint catcher?

00:32.695 --> 00:34.695
-[snap]
-Ow! Ow, ow, ow!

00:36.815 --> 00:38.945
How did you
get down here?

00:41.605 --> 00:42.525
Huh?

00:43.775 --> 00:46.145
Oh, come on!

00:46.145 --> 00:48.145
[panting, grunting]

00:50.735 --> 00:51.985
[sighs]

00:51.985 --> 00:54.775
-Did you know about this?
-[thudding]

00:54.775 --> 00:56.485
[snarling]

00:58.695 --> 01:01.145
[shrieking]

01:08.145 --> 01:09.985
[grunting]

01:13.945 --> 01:15.855
Thanks, Robirda.

01:15.855 --> 01:18.695
-Shutting down the portals
was drastic enough.
-Hekapoo?

01:18.695 --> 01:21.405
[Rhombulus]
Desperate times call
for desperate measures.

01:21.405 --> 01:23.525
But she's not even
following the plan!

01:23.525 --> 01:26.525
Look, I just want
that monster-smoocher
out of Mewni,

01:26.525 --> 01:28.525
and she's
our best option.

01:28.525 --> 01:30.565
Some risks
are worth taking.

01:30.565 --> 01:33.605
-But she's completely crazy!
-[crazy laughter]

01:33.605 --> 01:35.775
Oh, I'm the crazy one?

01:35.775 --> 01:39.235
The person saving our kingdom
from monster invaders? Ha!

01:39.235 --> 01:40.905
Did you hear that, Queen?

01:40.905 --> 01:42.645
Our kingdom
used to be great,

01:42.645 --> 01:44.605
but not anymore.

01:44.605 --> 01:47.775
It's time to give Mewni
back to the Mewmans.

01:50.405 --> 01:52.735
[altered voice]
And if that makes me crazy...

01:57.445 --> 02:00.565
...I'm as cuckoo-cuckoo-
cuckoo as they come.

02:00.565 --> 02:02.855
Sebastian,
get me my helmet!

02:02.855 --> 02:04.985
I gotta find Star.

02:04.985 --> 02:07.855
[Star groaning]

02:07.855 --> 02:10.025
Wha...

02:10.025 --> 02:13.445
Oh, where am I?

02:13.445 --> 02:15.235
-You're in Doop Doop's house!
-[screams]

02:15.235 --> 02:17.605
Doop Doop! Doop Doop?

02:17.605 --> 02:19.985
[chuckles] I mean, Doop Doop!
How? Why? How?

02:19.985 --> 02:21.735
Oh, it was
the craziest thing.

02:21.735 --> 02:24.025
I was just laying down,
singing to myself, and poof!

02:24.025 --> 02:26.815
Suddenly you're here,
and now we're roommates!

02:26.815 --> 02:28.735
Oh, man,
it's gonna be so great.

02:28.735 --> 02:31.195
We could stay up all night
and talk and paint our nails.

02:31.195 --> 02:33.025
-I don't have arms,
but that's okay.
-[explosions]

02:33.025 --> 02:35.235
-[gasps]
-We can use our imaginations.

02:35.235 --> 02:36.855
Then maybe we could
bake some cookies

02:36.855 --> 02:39.695
-and talk about
what boys we like...
-Wait a minute.

02:39.695 --> 02:41.695
That's coming
from my folks' castle!

02:41.695 --> 02:43.645
But let me...

02:43.645 --> 02:46.775
[whistling tune]

02:46.775 --> 02:49.485
-Call Marco!
-Calling Marco.

02:49.485 --> 02:51.525
[line rings, static]

02:51.525 --> 02:54.355
Ugh! Useless! Whoa!

02:56.445 --> 02:58.775
What is this?

03:00.445 --> 03:02.485
Definitely don't remember
this being here.

03:02.485 --> 03:04.735
Hey! Who goes there?

03:04.735 --> 03:06.445
Oh, uh, I'm sorry.

03:06.445 --> 03:08.695
I'm, um, Star Butterfly.

03:08.695 --> 03:10.905
Oh. My apologies.

03:10.905 --> 03:14.025
I thought you were
one of them monsters. Hold on.

03:14.025 --> 03:15.945
[gasps]

03:18.815 --> 03:20.905
-[gasps] Star?
-Mom!

03:20.905 --> 03:22.815
The portals aren't working!
How did you get to Mewni?

03:22.815 --> 03:26.315
-I found another way.
-Hurry! Get inside!

03:29.105 --> 03:30.775
Oh, Mommy,
I'm so glad you're okay.

03:30.775 --> 03:32.905
When the portals were
shut down, I didn't know.

03:32.905 --> 03:35.855
-I thought
something bad happened.
-We're okay, Star.

03:35.855 --> 03:38.945
What is going on?
I saw smoke and explosions.

03:38.945 --> 03:40.645
Monster Temple
is under attack.

03:40.645 --> 03:42.735
Everyone in the village
is on lockdown.

03:42.735 --> 03:45.775
What? Oh! Oh, my gosh.
We gotta go now.
Eclipsa needs us.

03:45.775 --> 03:48.735
Star, I can't just leave.

03:48.735 --> 03:52.105
The Yurt people depend on me
to ensure their safety.

03:52.105 --> 03:55.275
Well, I guess that explains
this huge wall you guys
are putting up.

03:55.275 --> 03:57.855
You there! Gather more
stones for the gate!

03:57.855 --> 04:00.775
-And you, shuck that corn!
-Aah, okay!

04:00.775 --> 04:03.945
You should stay here too.
Its far too dangerous out there.

04:03.945 --> 04:06.605
I've been by Eclipsa's side
this whole time.

04:06.605 --> 04:09.605
-I can't abandon her now.
-Star, wait!

04:10.945 --> 04:13.315
If you really want
to protect me,

04:13.315 --> 04:14.775
you know where I'll be.

04:18.195 --> 04:21.985
That's okay!
I didn't want a hug too!

04:23.985 --> 04:25.735
[Janna groaning]

04:27.645 --> 04:30.775
-[Glossaryck] Oh, look.
She's finally awake.
-What-- [screams]

04:32.065 --> 04:34.775
[Meteora laughing, cooing]

04:34.775 --> 04:37.315
Um, what's going on?
Where's Star?

04:37.315 --> 04:39.195
Star is with Doop Doop.

04:39.195 --> 04:41.775
That's, uh, not
a real person's name.

04:41.775 --> 04:44.445
Never mind. I should know
by now that you are
never helpful.

04:45.605 --> 04:48.775
-Hmm.
-[giggles]

04:49.985 --> 04:51.775
Hello.

04:51.775 --> 04:54.815
Star? Marco?

04:57.485 --> 05:01.235
-Huh. It is a dang
ghost town up in here.
-[pounding, people yelling]

05:03.445 --> 05:05.355
[gasps]

05:05.355 --> 05:07.945
[all screaming]

05:07.945 --> 05:09.695
Hey, that's my boot!

05:15.985 --> 05:17.855
[screaming]

05:20.235 --> 05:21.735
[screaming]

05:25.695 --> 05:28.605
-[screaming]
-Look out!

05:28.605 --> 05:31.775
Whoa! Thanks for
the lifesaving, dude.

05:31.775 --> 05:33.445
Don't thank me yet.

05:36.905 --> 05:38.145
Now, my love!

05:38.145 --> 05:40.945
Ha! [roaring]

05:40.945 --> 05:43.905
-Yeah!
-Get the villagers to safety.

05:43.905 --> 05:46.735
-I'll take care of this.
-Hurry, everyone!

05:46.735 --> 05:48.855
While it's distracted,
get inside, where it's safe!

05:50.105 --> 05:51.815
[screaming]

06:01.855 --> 06:03.105
[chuckles]

06:11.105 --> 06:13.405
Ha, ha!

06:14.985 --> 06:18.065
[roars] Why...

06:18.065 --> 06:19.735
Huh? What? What is...

06:19.735 --> 06:21.735
-What's happening?
-[thudding footsteps]

06:25.145 --> 06:26.945
[screaming, groans]

06:26.945 --> 06:29.485
Aah! Globgor!
Are you all right?

06:29.485 --> 06:32.065
I'm fine. Just got the wind
knocked out of...

06:32.065 --> 06:33.815
-[electrical zapping]
-[groans]

06:35.485 --> 06:36.985
Oh, no.

06:36.985 --> 06:38.735
Janna, watch my husband.

06:38.735 --> 06:41.195
-I'll take care
of that brute myself.
-[Globgor] No.

06:41.195 --> 06:44.105
I can keep fighting.
I just need to...
[grunts]

06:44.105 --> 06:46.275
-[groans]
-[zapping]

06:46.275 --> 06:48.605
[grunts, groans]

06:48.605 --> 06:50.315
[grunts, groans]

06:50.315 --> 06:53.315
[panting] What's...
What's happening to me?

06:53.315 --> 06:56.025
-Sweetie.
-[man] Don't worry, Eclipsa!

06:56.025 --> 06:57.905
-We'll protect you!
-For the queen!

06:57.905 --> 06:59.985
[shouting]

07:06.775 --> 07:09.315
Velvet inferno!

07:13.945 --> 07:16.985
[gasps]
Black Widow Calamity Cobweb!

07:22.145 --> 07:25.025
-Let's go.
-No. I could still take it!

07:25.025 --> 07:28.025
I hit it with
a very powerful spell
that barely made a dent!

07:28.025 --> 07:30.105
-We have to fall back!
-[groans]

07:30.105 --> 07:32.485
Come on, tough guy.

07:36.905 --> 07:39.355
-[thudding]
-[all gasp]

07:46.105 --> 07:47.855
I can't take it anymore.

07:47.855 --> 07:49.775
I need to go back out there
and fight that thing!

07:49.775 --> 07:51.605
-[zapping]
-[groans]

07:51.605 --> 07:54.605
Absolutely not.
You're in no condition
to fight.

07:54.605 --> 07:56.905
It's just a flesh wound.
It's nothing.

07:56.905 --> 07:58.815
It is not nothing.

07:58.815 --> 08:01.065
I'd recognize
that wound anywhere.

08:01.065 --> 08:02.695
That soldier...

08:02.695 --> 08:05.905
-it was a Solarian warrior.
-What?

08:05.905 --> 08:08.145
[gasps] A Solarian warrior?

08:08.145 --> 08:10.905
-But how?
-Um, yeah.

08:10.905 --> 08:12.905
Should I know
what this is, or...

08:12.905 --> 08:14.985
A Solarian super-warrior.

08:14.985 --> 08:18.695
Queen Solaria created them
to destroy all monsters.

08:18.695 --> 08:20.235
They were
incredibly powerful,

08:20.235 --> 08:22.815
but that power
made them unstable.

08:22.815 --> 08:26.065
I don't know how
one of them managed to
survive for this long.

08:26.065 --> 08:28.565
So what do we do?
Can you fix this?

08:28.565 --> 08:31.815
I'm not sure. That sword
was specially designed

08:31.815 --> 08:34.645
to do harm to monsters,
but I'll do what I can.

08:34.645 --> 08:35.985
-[thudding]

08:35.985 --> 08:37.235

08:47.195 --> 08:49.645
-[zapping]
-[groaning]

08:49.645 --> 08:52.445
Globgor, my love, I need you
to go hide with Meteora.

08:52.445 --> 08:54.945
-What?
-I'm going to try
to get that thing

08:54.945 --> 08:56.405
away from our castle.

08:56.405 --> 08:59.025
-Eclipsa! No! [groans]
-[zapping]

08:59.025 --> 09:00.645
[screaming]

09:07.485 --> 09:11.105
Get... out...
of my kingdom.

09:14.235 --> 09:17.485
-[groans]
-Sorry. Is it too tight?

09:17.485 --> 09:20.775
No, no. It's perfect.
I feel ready to
take on anything...

09:20.775 --> 09:22.355
-[zapping]
-[groans]

09:22.355 --> 09:24.905
[exclaims] I'm going
to get more bandages.

09:24.905 --> 09:27.235
Dude, maybe you just
need to rest.

09:27.235 --> 09:29.235
I just feel
like a coward.

09:29.235 --> 09:31.645
I never should've let her
to fight that thing alone.

09:31.645 --> 09:34.275
Are you kidding?
You can barely make a fist.

09:34.275 --> 09:36.275
What could you possibly do?

09:36.275 --> 09:38.275
Eclipsa knows
what she's doing.

09:38.275 --> 09:40.195
She's got this.

09:40.195 --> 09:42.695
This is true.
She is terrifying.

09:42.695 --> 09:44.315
I love her so much!
