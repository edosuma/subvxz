00:33.241 --> 00:35.476
I am Alexander Aleksy,

00:35.509 --> 00:37.678
spelled, "K-S-Y."

00:37.711 --> 00:39.713
You will not forget this
when I disappear.

00:39.747 --> 00:42.050
Alexander Aleksy,
spelled, "K-S-Y."

00:42.083 --> 00:43.651
You will not forget this,
Alexander...

01:11.179 --> 01:12.881
Welcome to Charley Creek.

01:12.914 --> 01:15.050
- I'm Jonas.
- Good day, sir.

01:17.252 --> 01:19.720
I'm Alexander Aleksy.

01:19.753 --> 01:21.156
Nice to meet ya.

01:21.189 --> 01:24.059
- What can I do ya for?
- Sir, I received

01:24.092 --> 01:26.962
this block of ice,

01:26.995 --> 01:28.997
but I didn't send for it.

01:30.764 --> 01:33.001
The sam hell'd you
wrestle that out?

01:33.034 --> 01:34.568
Let me show you.

01:52.720 --> 01:54.755
Try it.

01:54.788 --> 01:56.000
- Try it.
- Yeah, I'm not thirsty

01:56.024 --> 01:57.658
right now, sonny.

02:02.931 --> 02:05.066
Do you have an ice box?

02:05.100 --> 02:07.568
Might be able to find one
around here somewhere.

02:07.601 --> 02:09.870
Should put this in it.

02:09.904 --> 02:11.605
Liven the place up.

02:11.638 --> 02:13.540
I ain't got no money
for you, son.

02:13.574 --> 02:14.976
I ain't got no money.

02:26.754 --> 02:28.089
No need to
come any closer, sonny.

02:28.123 --> 02:29.790
You don't need to
come any closer.

02:29.823 --> 02:31.226
That's... that's far enough.

02:33.627 --> 02:36.563
Sir, I got my
last in my suitcase.

02:36.597 --> 02:37.564
I don't know...

02:37.598 --> 02:38.878
I'm dripping all over the floor.

02:45.373 --> 02:47.042
Close enough.

02:49.210 --> 02:50.844
No, it's not.

02:52.813 --> 02:54.748
Might wanna back up there
a little bit.

02:54.782 --> 02:56.650
Why don't you take a little sip?

03:00.889 --> 03:03.590
All right.

03:13.134 --> 03:15.103
Ain't no need for this, sonny.

03:19.974 --> 03:22.077
Take me to the safe.

03:22.110 --> 03:24.778
I ain't gonna
take you to no safe.

03:24.812 --> 03:26.881
Mr. Haywood,

03:26.915 --> 03:28.883
take me to the safe,

03:28.917 --> 03:30.851
now!

03:33.321 --> 03:36.057
- Uh-uh.
- Move.

03:36.091 --> 03:37.926
- No.
- Move.

03:37.959 --> 03:40.895
- Uh-uh.
- Open your mouth.

03:40.929 --> 03:42.263
Open it.

03:50.238 --> 03:51.772
Count till 3.

03:56.444 --> 03:59.746
One.

03:59.780 --> 04:01.149
Two.

04:14.295 --> 04:15.964
Three.

04:40.989 --> 04:43.458
I'm Alexander Aleksy,

04:43.491 --> 04:46.961
spelled, "K-S-Y,"

04:46.995 --> 04:51.865
and I'm truly sorry,

04:51.900 --> 04:53.935
Mr. Haywood.

05:22.497 --> 05:26.733
It's proven difficult
writing years on a page.

05:26.767 --> 05:29.337
A lot has happened
since he left.

05:29.370 --> 05:32.941
My dear brother.

05:32.974 --> 05:36.044
Well, I'll try and transcribe
my feelings on such matters

05:36.077 --> 05:39.780
the only way I know how.

05:39.813 --> 05:43.084
My only request is that
you pay mind to the details

05:43.117 --> 05:44.986
of my story.

05:45.019 --> 05:47.188
With hope we see
eye to eye in the end.

05:49.157 --> 05:52.060
I suspect we'll
truly know it when we see it.

05:54.128 --> 05:56.231
The truth.

06:11.446 --> 06:13.948
Every time
that door swings open,

06:13.982 --> 06:15.782
I think it's gonna be him.

06:20.888 --> 06:23.191
But, it's just echoes

06:23.224 --> 06:25.893
of those rowdy days.

06:35.937 --> 06:38.473
Simple truth is,
we just don't like

06:38.506 --> 06:41.242
people telling us
what we can and can't do.

06:46.147 --> 06:48.116
Nobody does.

07:05.566 --> 07:07.268
August, will you hold up

07:07.302 --> 07:10.171
just one goddamn second?

07:10.204 --> 07:12.140
Hold up a second.

07:12.173 --> 07:14.242
August.

07:16.878 --> 07:19.247
Make yourself useful.

07:19.280 --> 07:21.249
No, no, no.

07:21.282 --> 07:23.584
August, just... just stop.

07:23.618 --> 07:27.488
I need to tell you something.

07:27.522 --> 07:29.290
You're late.

07:29.324 --> 07:30.892
- We got company coming.
- I... I know.

07:30.925 --> 07:33.027
- You know how I feel about it.
- Look, I know.

07:35.496 --> 07:38.399
August, we... we need to go home.

07:38.433 --> 07:40.101
August!

07:45.139 --> 07:46.574
You need to go home.

07:46.607 --> 07:48.643
Stop!

08:05.593 --> 08:08.096
We appreciate everything
that you have done,

08:08.129 --> 08:10.598
and we'll be sure
to pay you for your trouble.

08:10.631 --> 08:13.468
No, really, it's...
it's absolutely no trouble.

08:13.501 --> 08:15.541
- We just gotta...
- We... we can take it from here.

08:17.438 --> 08:21.209
Well, he needs
professional attention.

08:21.242 --> 08:24.245
He's unresponsive.

08:27.048 --> 08:28.549
Was this guy a magician?

08:28.583 --> 08:30.351
Where'd he get ice?

08:32.086 --> 08:33.955
I don't know, that or a dentist.

08:33.988 --> 08:35.289
Take a look at his mouth.

08:37.392 --> 08:39.494
Look.

08:52.173 --> 08:54.142
Does he need
another quilt on him?

09:23.438 --> 09:27.175
He entered our lives
like a southern wind,

09:27.208 --> 09:30.545
giving way
to no one but himself.

09:30.578 --> 09:34.715
A violent streak
managed with utmost care.

09:34.749 --> 09:37.718
Fresh blood drawn into,

09:37.752 --> 09:40.455
well, it was
already muddy water.

10:39.814 --> 10:41.682
We should get the police.

10:44.352 --> 10:47.488
You really want the badge
sniffing around?

10:47.522 --> 10:49.457
Use your head.

10:51.392 --> 10:52.827
You're right.

10:54.662 --> 10:56.230
Now, what do we tell Jimmy?

10:56.264 --> 10:57.598
He's due tomorrow evening.

11:01.369 --> 11:03.204
The truth.

11:03.237 --> 11:04.672
Who's Jimmy?

11:06.440 --> 11:09.110
From the Dance-a-thon, remember?

11:09.143 --> 11:10.645
Mhm.

11:10.678 --> 11:12.747
That big donor.

11:12.780 --> 11:15.583
Oh, I thought
his name was Helman.

11:15.616 --> 11:17.718
Oh, it is sometimes.

11:17.752 --> 11:19.654
Hey.

11:19.687 --> 11:21.722
Why are you talking about it?

11:21.756 --> 11:25.760
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know
it was such a big secret.

11:25.793 --> 11:28.563
That was more of a loan anyhow.

11:28.596 --> 11:31.332
Oh, well, how would you know?

11:31.365 --> 11:33.100
Because not all businesses

11:33.134 --> 11:36.237
lay down at the front desk.

11:38.272 --> 11:41.576
Well,
since we're telling secrets,

11:41.609 --> 11:43.578
safe wasn't
exactly empty neither.

11:43.611 --> 11:45.446
What's that supposed to mean?

11:45.479 --> 11:48.516
Means there was a note.

11:48.549 --> 11:50.886
What note?

11:52.653 --> 11:55.590
- Huh?
- She knows.

11:55.623 --> 11:58.192
She found it.

12:11.706 --> 12:14.508
Thanks for the honey, boys.

12:14.542 --> 12:16.344
Sorry for the cold shoulder.

12:18.212 --> 12:19.915
You can retrieve
your compensation

12:19.948 --> 12:21.682
October 24.

12:23.851 --> 12:26.354
Route 3, Box 119.

12:28.422 --> 12:32.293
Come early,
or go home empty handed.

12:33.861 --> 12:35.429
PS,

12:35.463 --> 12:38.799
tell Johnny his package
is safe with me.

12:38.833 --> 12:41.369
Alexander Aleksy.

12:45.606 --> 12:48.609
What do you wanna do?

12:48.643 --> 12:50.811
Why are you showing me this?

12:50.845 --> 12:53.882
Well, I needed you calm.

12:53.915 --> 12:55.549
No, I said why.

12:57.718 --> 13:00.254
'Cause I can't go alone.

13:00.287 --> 13:01.856
You can't waltz with a criminal?

13:01.890 --> 13:05.626
- That's why I'm showing ya.
- What are you showing me?

13:05.660 --> 13:07.762
I'm asking
for your help, August.

13:09.864 --> 13:13.501
I gave that up a long time ago.

13:13.534 --> 13:15.937
Yeah.

13:15.971 --> 13:17.605
We noticed.

13:30.651 --> 13:33.754
Where's the ammunition?

13:33.788 --> 13:35.556
- Where you going?
- I need the ammunition

13:35.589 --> 13:37.893
for the Colt.

13:37.926 --> 13:39.427
Take your coat off.

13:42.463 --> 13:44.632
Give me the gun.

13:44.665 --> 13:46.367
You need to sit down.

13:54.742 --> 13:56.477
Huh?

14:02.017 --> 14:03.551
Oh, God.

14:10.758 --> 14:12.560
Well, don't let him sit in it.

14:12.593 --> 14:15.596
Well, please get a bedpan
or something.

14:28.877 --> 14:30.611
There.

14:30.644 --> 14:32.413
He'd like that.

14:32.446 --> 14:34.983
It's not very patriotic.

14:35.016 --> 14:36.985
Well, we ain't
using a cooking pan.

15:00.841 --> 15:04.545
How many pairs of socks
you got on?

15:04.578 --> 15:06.747
Regular amount.

15:28.702 --> 15:30.538
Go put on another pair.

15:39.547 --> 15:41.950
If he wakes up...

15:46.955 --> 15:48.455
tell him it's my fault.

17:09.570 --> 17:11.973
Are you sure you know
where we're going?

17:12.007 --> 17:14.109
It said, "South."

17:14.142 --> 17:16.044
Route 5, this is south.

17:16.077 --> 17:18.746
I thought it said, "3."

17:20.814 --> 17:22.918
Either way, we're headed south.

17:30.858 --> 17:33.028
Well, is the corn a necessity?

17:33.061 --> 17:34.896
It is till we hit the trees.

17:36.530 --> 17:37.665
Well, how far is it?

17:37.698 --> 17:39.733
Can't we just walk the square?

17:41.869 --> 17:44.039
Will you use your fucking head?

17:44.072 --> 17:45.515
How many times
you been off the property

17:45.539 --> 17:47.841
- toting a pistol?
- It was my idea.

17:51.980 --> 17:53.647
Wait!

17:55.749 --> 17:57.886
I'm sorry.

17:57.919 --> 17:59.921
You opposed to
getting your soles dirty?

17:59.955 --> 18:01.789
- Or you got an allergy?
- I was... I was just

18:01.822 --> 18:04.059
making conversation.

18:04.092 --> 18:05.592
You were whining.

18:10.098 --> 18:12.633
What's the plan again?

18:12.666 --> 18:14.002
Ain't no plan.

18:22.310 --> 18:23.744
What?

18:23.777 --> 18:25.612
Take it off.

18:25.646 --> 18:27.916
- What are you talking about?
- Take your shoes off.

18:31.052 --> 18:33.188
- Come on, quick, take it off.
- Aw, man.

18:43.597 --> 18:45.200
And your top pair of socks.

18:56.177 --> 18:59.047
Now, I was unknowing
of the exact nature

18:59.080 --> 19:00.858
- of his condition.
- Put those in your pocket.

19:00.882 --> 19:03.717
- Let's go.
- It was steeled up deep,

19:03.751 --> 19:06.254
and he was good at hiding it.

19:06.287 --> 19:08.089
But, I could tell

19:08.123 --> 19:11.792
his mind was full
to the brim with it.

19:11.825 --> 19:14.795
He was all ideals and protocol.

19:14.828 --> 19:17.298
Callused up,
well before I had the brass

19:17.332 --> 19:19.134
to ask him what happened.

20:33.341 --> 20:34.952
Might not walk out of the house
because they don't know

20:34.976 --> 20:36.377
what to do.

20:36.411 --> 20:38.246
It's been a while.

20:38.279 --> 20:39.713
Excuse me, gentlemen.

20:42.250 --> 20:43.817
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

20:43.851 --> 20:45.253
I'm looking for Jimmy.

20:45.286 --> 20:49.224
Does anyone know
where I can find Jimmy?

20:49.257 --> 20:50.791
Who's he?

20:50.824 --> 20:52.726
- I don't know who he is.
- Who's asking?

20:55.330 --> 20:58.900
I was asked to present
this bottle of Virginia Dare,

20:58.933 --> 21:00.734
and if I won't,
I'm gonna get in trouble, sir,

21:00.767 --> 21:02.836
so please,

21:02.870 --> 21:05.340
- if you could help me out.
- Well, it's free.

21:07.475 --> 21:09.177
On the house.

21:13.882 --> 21:15.450
Never say no to Dare.

21:18.453 --> 21:20.388
Here you go, kid.

21:23.024 --> 21:24.691
- Thank you, sir.
- And don't come back

21:24.725 --> 21:26.727
unless we snap our fingers.

21:28.795 --> 21:30.107
- You gonna break that open...
- This kid.

21:30.131 --> 21:32.799
Or bogart it?

21:32.833 --> 21:34.969
I'm thinking about keeping it
on my mantle a while,

21:35.003 --> 21:36.737
a little further away from you.

21:38.940 --> 21:40.408
So, when'd you meet her?

21:40.441 --> 21:43.211
Uh, June.

21:43.244 --> 21:46.114
Maybe a little before.

21:46.147 --> 21:48.316
And she stuck around
after your little stunt in July?

21:50.285 --> 21:52.253
Well, yeah,
she helped me practice.

21:52.287 --> 21:54.155
What is there to practice?

21:54.189 --> 21:55.798
You just wobble around
a little bit, right?

21:55.822 --> 21:58.092
No, no, there's steps.

21:58.126 --> 22:00.361
It's an art form.

22:00.395 --> 22:02.330
- All right, let me show you.
- All right.

22:07.168 --> 22:09.003
It wasn't a stunt.

22:09.037 --> 22:11.139
We raised enough
to keep the doors open,

22:11.172 --> 22:12.373
and then some.

22:14.309 --> 22:16.110
I kept the place alive,

22:16.144 --> 22:18.346
if I'm partial to admitting it.

22:21.815 --> 22:23.750
It all proved to be
quite the crossroads

22:23.784 --> 22:26.820
for our little outfit.

22:26.853 --> 22:31.059
Filled our safe with paper
we only dreamed of.

22:31.092 --> 22:33.528
Though, I hesitate

22:33.561 --> 22:36.830
to comment on the nature
of our company that afternoon.

22:51.045 --> 22:53.314
Charley Creek
world series of step.

22:53.348 --> 22:55.049
Get on in here
and take the floor,

22:55.083 --> 22:57.418
Bonnie and Clydes
dance the night away.

23:25.213 --> 23:26.813
Making a donation, sir?

23:28.416 --> 23:29.994
I'd like to talk to you
about that first,

23:30.018 --> 23:32.453
- if that's all right.
- Yeah, we can do that.

23:35.423 --> 23:36.891
Who's in charge here?

23:36.924 --> 23:38.559
Name's Jonas,
you're looking at him.

23:40.528 --> 23:42.397
All right, then.

23:58.546 --> 24:00.448
Grabs here.

24:02.984 --> 24:05.053
Like so.

24:05.086 --> 24:06.853
Hey.

24:08.323 --> 24:11.959
Yeah, I'm gonna pass on that.

24:11.993 --> 24:13.995
You wanna be holding up a wall
at your wedding day?

24:15.363 --> 24:17.065
I don't know.

24:21.035 --> 24:23.338
Just saying, you can really
connect with someone.

24:23.371 --> 24:25.106
It's really special.

24:30.478 --> 24:32.022
You know I've been thinking
about taking Edie

24:32.046 --> 24:34.115
to a moving picture.

24:34.148 --> 24:35.483
I've been saving up.

24:35.516 --> 24:38.386
Maybe Thanksgiving.

24:38.419 --> 24:40.621
Thanksgiving, December,
I don't know.

24:43.358 --> 24:46.160
You ain't taking her nowhere
if our boy ain't receptive.

24:50.498 --> 24:52.467
- Hm?
- Don't think I don't know.

24:56.637 --> 25:00.375
I mean, your head
is entirely misplaced.

25:00.408 --> 25:02.543
How are you thinking
about that right now?

25:05.146 --> 25:06.690
Well, we're supposed to
just think about it

25:06.714 --> 25:09.317
the whole damn time?

25:09.350 --> 25:10.885
I am thinking about it.

25:13.988 --> 25:15.957
I hope you are.

25:26.067 --> 25:27.935
Can I ask you something?

25:27.969 --> 25:29.437
Shoot.

25:32.473 --> 25:34.709
Who are you doing this for?

25:34.742 --> 25:36.511
Me or Jonas?

25:45.720 --> 25:47.655
Can I take care of this first?

25:52.059 --> 25:53.737
You know, 'cause Jonas
ain't like he used to be.

25:53.761 --> 25:55.963
He's simmered down.

26:05.473 --> 26:07.108
Nevermind.

26:09.076 --> 26:10.411
I'm doing it for Jimmy.

26:22.089 --> 26:23.958
I'm doing it for Jimmy.

26:39.807 --> 26:42.109
Can I help you?

26:42.143 --> 26:44.045
Where's Jonas?

26:44.078 --> 26:46.414
Oh, he's, um,

26:46.447 --> 26:48.683
under the weather at the moment.

26:48.716 --> 26:50.718
Totally out of commission,
I'm afraid.

26:53.054 --> 26:56.090
I'd like to speak to him,
and he should be expecting me.

26:56.123 --> 26:58.526
He's in a bad way
since yesterday.

26:58.559 --> 27:01.162
A bit of an incident
with the, uh...

27:01.195 --> 27:03.731
- the ice delivery.
- Ice?

27:03.764 --> 27:07.702
That's right, um, getting ready
for you, I suppose.

27:07.735 --> 27:10.204
Uh, you're early.

27:10.238 --> 27:12.073
Um.

27:12.106 --> 27:15.576
Mr. Lawrence, is it?

27:15.610 --> 27:18.446
Just by a day.

27:18.479 --> 27:21.182
How do you know?

27:21.215 --> 27:23.718
Well, I heard a song or two.

27:26.721 --> 27:29.090
What have you heard?

27:29.123 --> 27:31.292
Just that
you're a very generous man.

27:34.195 --> 27:36.197
I can be.

27:39.834 --> 27:42.303
Where's the ballerina?

27:42.336 --> 27:44.405
I beg your pardon.

27:44.438 --> 27:46.440
Reed.

27:46.474 --> 27:48.142
- Oh.
- I believe that's his name.

27:48.175 --> 27:49.586
- Yeah.
- Frankie's little drummer boy.

27:49.610 --> 27:51.612
Mhm, they're out chopping wood,

27:51.646 --> 27:54.749
uh, before the frost hits.

27:54.782 --> 27:57.151
Over at the River farm?

27:57.184 --> 27:59.487
Suppose so.

28:02.891 --> 28:04.458
Um.

28:07.828 --> 28:09.730
You know, I'm right,
you are early.

28:09.764 --> 28:12.400
Um, can I get you a room?

28:12.433 --> 28:14.635
- You got the whole place to...
- No, thanks, doll.

28:14.669 --> 28:17.138
I'm in a fresh-air kind of mood.

28:17.171 --> 28:18.706
I prefer fresh air,

28:18.739 --> 28:20.608
being in and out of here.

28:20.641 --> 28:22.878
Just, um...

28:22.911 --> 28:26.747
If you prefer fresh air,
I can just open a window.

28:37.758 --> 28:40.528
What'd you say your name was?

28:40.561 --> 28:43.397
My friends call me Polly.

28:43.431 --> 28:44.832
No, sweetie.

28:44.865 --> 28:46.534
My hands are dirty.

28:46.567 --> 28:48.302
They ain't clean.

28:50.738 --> 28:52.373
Neither are mine.

28:52.406 --> 28:53.674
Just been working.

28:58.346 --> 29:00.481
Oh.

29:02.617 --> 29:04.886
Um, let's see, um.

29:12.526 --> 29:13.861
Hey.

29:16.831 --> 29:19.433
Anybody ever
call you Greta Garbo?

29:24.438 --> 29:26.207
Not lately.

29:30.879 --> 29:32.580
What a shame.

29:49.296 --> 29:51.332
"By Jove,

29:51.365 --> 29:54.802
I'm not covetous for gold,

29:54.835 --> 29:59.273
nor care I who doth
feed upon my cost.

29:59.306 --> 30:01.509
It yearns me not

30:01.542 --> 30:04.311
if men my garments wear.

30:04.345 --> 30:07.916
Such outward things
dwell not in my desires.

30:11.252 --> 30:13.989
But, it be a sin

30:14.022 --> 30:16.925
to covet honor,

30:16.958 --> 30:18.426
I am

30:18.459 --> 30:22.396
"the most offending soul alive."

30:26.667 --> 30:28.769
Shit.

30:53.794 --> 30:55.296
How did it go?

30:57.565 --> 31:00.568
Did you make the paper?

31:03.471 --> 31:07.008
Our man was grade-A mystery,

31:07.042 --> 31:09.477
that had a shine
for lower company.

31:09.510 --> 31:10.711
Cicada.

31:12.680 --> 31:16.317
A peculiar apparition with
a taste for stories tonight.

31:16.350 --> 31:17.852
It's about Goddamn time.

31:17.886 --> 31:20.454
It's a plague on this flat land.

31:20.488 --> 31:23.858
He had a way
of wrapping in words so tight,

31:23.892 --> 31:25.559
when he was finished,
you didn't know

31:25.593 --> 31:27.762
which way was up.

31:30.664 --> 31:32.500
Alden Brooks,

31:32.533 --> 31:35.469
a scrappy little critter.

31:35.503 --> 31:36.737
A volunteer

31:36.771 --> 31:39.908
for the almighty schemer,

31:39.941 --> 31:41.742
who kept the county social

31:41.776 --> 31:43.711
with his bathtub gin.

31:43.744 --> 31:46.814
This is my shit, I don't
have enough of it as it is.

31:52.353 --> 31:53.788
How does this smell?

32:00.628 --> 32:03.397
The King James Bible.

32:03.430 --> 32:05.399
The future.

32:18.445 --> 32:21.348
That's what I was gonna say...
hey, are you gonna share this?

32:21.382 --> 32:22.716
Our life or not.

32:22.750 --> 32:24.785
This.

32:24.819 --> 32:26.988
What is that?

32:30.724 --> 32:32.894
This is...

32:37.966 --> 32:39.567
Virginia Dare.

32:41.769 --> 32:44.672
All right, Virginia.

32:44.705 --> 32:46.540
You talked me into it.

32:49.110 --> 32:51.846
Not for drinking.

32:51.880 --> 32:53.814
Just a swig.

32:53.848 --> 32:56.918
I ain't been on the grape
in a coon's age.

33:01.990 --> 33:05.060
- Not tonight, Alden.
- Not tonight, huh?

33:05.093 --> 33:07.628
All right, well, uh,

33:07.661 --> 33:10.731
what in the hell is this thing?

33:10.764 --> 33:13.634
For sport, to protect your face.

33:13.667 --> 33:15.569
My face?

33:19.573 --> 33:21.842
How do you wear it?

33:30.684 --> 33:32.686
I feel like a fucking radio.

33:32.720 --> 33:34.455
Jesus Christ!

33:38.826 --> 33:40.061
Stab you with this.

33:42.898 --> 33:44.966
This is important.

33:46.800 --> 33:47.936
Hey, hey.

33:47.969 --> 33:49.436
Hey!

33:52.040 --> 33:54.608
Take that off and I will
stab you in the face.

33:59.747 --> 34:02.850
My face is
very pretty right now.

34:02.884 --> 34:05.020
I like it just the way it is.

34:05.053 --> 34:07.889
So, let's, uh...

34:07.923 --> 34:09.690
Let's put a pin in that.

35:02.643 --> 35:03.844
One second.

35:03.878 --> 35:05.113
- Slow down.
- What's wrong?

35:05.146 --> 35:06.714
Slow down.

35:06.747 --> 35:08.582
I, um...

35:08.615 --> 35:10.018
Listen, I just have...

35:15.924 --> 35:18.259
I need to get in that safe
before...

35:18.293 --> 35:20.828
we get too acquainted.

35:20.861 --> 35:23.664
I don't know the combination.

35:23.697 --> 35:25.866
Who does?

35:25.900 --> 35:27.268
Jonas.

35:27.302 --> 35:29.670
Who else?

35:29.703 --> 35:31.239
Nobody that I know of.

35:39.680 --> 35:42.050
Then, let's go
pay him a visit real quick.

35:42.083 --> 35:43.717
Yeah.

35:46.787 --> 35:49.623
I don't think that's gonna work.

35:49.656 --> 35:50.959
Why?

35:55.063 --> 35:58.066
Um, he's got a bit of a cold

35:58.099 --> 35:59.334
at the moment.

35:59.367 --> 36:01.002
And?

36:17.052 --> 36:18.987
You didn't paint it like that.

36:19.020 --> 36:21.222
Who did that?

36:21.256 --> 36:23.590
- Nobody... nobody knows.
- Hey.

36:26.961 --> 36:29.264
Come on, come on,
we're going for a ride.

36:41.076 --> 36:42.911
Hey, Jonas.

36:42.944 --> 36:44.946
It's Jimmy.

36:44.979 --> 36:46.713
- He ain't spoke since...
- Hey.

36:48.983 --> 36:50.351
I'm talking to him.

36:52.387 --> 36:55.356
I'm here for the, uh, package.

36:55.390 --> 36:56.891
Hey, Jonas, wake up.

36:58.859 --> 37:00.161
You hear me.

37:01.963 --> 37:03.274
- Oh, man.
- I told you, he ain't spoke

37:03.298 --> 37:06.901
- since yesterday.
- No... Jonas!

37:06.935 --> 37:08.303
I think he had a hard spell.

37:16.743 --> 37:18.779
I need that combination.

37:21.382 --> 37:23.151
Well.

37:23.184 --> 37:24.727
You know, I find it
kind of queer that the boys

37:24.751 --> 37:28.089
just left him
sitting in his rocker.

37:30.158 --> 37:31.893
They don't even know yet.

37:34.229 --> 37:37.332
You've been taking care of him,
but you left him all alone.

37:37.365 --> 37:39.833
That don't all add up.

37:39.867 --> 37:41.970
To watch the desk.

37:48.076 --> 37:50.879
Out, out.

37:50.912 --> 37:53.915
Come on, Jonas, hey, Jonas.

37:53.948 --> 37:56.151
Wake up, love, come on.

37:56.184 --> 37:58.819
- You got company.
- Wake up, Jonas!

37:58.852 --> 38:00.754
- Nap's over, amigo.
- Hey, gentle.

39:34.916 --> 39:37.485
John.

39:37.518 --> 39:41.788
In admiration of you
and your escapades,

39:41.822 --> 39:45.093
I'd like to request
a rendezvous.

39:45.126 --> 39:49.130
Come to Route 3, Box 176,

39:49.163 --> 39:52.500
south of the Slocum Trail.

39:52.533 --> 39:55.270
If you want your money,
come alone.

39:55.303 --> 39:57.205
No weapons.

39:57.238 --> 39:59.173
Just a conversation

39:59.207 --> 40:01.376
with a Jack Rabbit.

40:01.409 --> 40:04.379
Love, Alexander Aleksy.

40:07.949 --> 40:10.151
What kind of name is Aleksy?

41:21.556 --> 41:23.358
He knew what he was doing.

41:23.391 --> 41:26.194
Had us all
right where he wanted.

41:26.227 --> 41:28.196
Whether we knew it or not,

41:28.229 --> 41:32.166
our clock was ticking
on a tilt we ain't never seen,

41:32.200 --> 41:35.036
all over some $4,000.

41:35.069 --> 41:37.605
I'll take care of it, all right,
you just keep your mouth quiet.

41:37.638 --> 41:39.683
It'll be fine, it'll be fine,
I know him, we go way back,

41:39.707 --> 41:41.309
he's a good friend of mine.

41:41.342 --> 41:42.677
Just don't, you know.

41:42.710 --> 41:45.179
Don't what?

41:45.213 --> 41:46.981
You're the one
that wanted to go.

41:47.014 --> 41:50.184
Now here I am, taking care
of the situation like always.

41:50.218 --> 41:52.487
Always.

42:07.034 --> 42:09.003
What are you doing here?

42:17.578 --> 42:20.948
I hate to ask it, but,

42:20.982 --> 42:23.351
I need an advance.

42:23.384 --> 42:26.087
An advance?

42:26.120 --> 42:28.623
Now, see, the problem is,

42:28.656 --> 42:32.994
you ain't seen a face dollar
since August,

42:33.027 --> 42:35.396
August.

42:37.165 --> 42:40.401
Thanksgiving's coming up,
then Christmas.

42:40.435 --> 42:43.070
You know I'll be good for it.

42:43.104 --> 42:44.639
What's the hurry?

42:49.477 --> 42:52.213
We're tangled up
with the wrong folks.

42:52.246 --> 42:54.248
We're short a bit,
just need to buy some time.

42:54.282 --> 42:57.452
Oh, well, you are in luck.

42:57.485 --> 43:01.489
I have a beautiful paper tree
right out back.

43:01.522 --> 43:03.424
You're more than welcome to it.

43:03.458 --> 43:05.726
Brooksy.

43:05.760 --> 43:08.095
I've been loyal to ya.

43:08.129 --> 43:10.264
That's 'cause
nobody in this county

43:10.298 --> 43:12.333
- has got what I got.
- Nobody in this county

43:12.366 --> 43:14.101
got what we got either.

43:15.470 --> 43:17.371
And what's that, huh?

43:17.405 --> 43:19.740
- Empty Bethlehem?
- We got a new customer.

43:22.310 --> 43:23.611
I heard.

43:27.682 --> 43:29.717
That basement floor.

43:29.750 --> 43:31.652
It's yours if you want it.

43:31.686 --> 43:33.621
60-40 at the door.

43:35.490 --> 43:39.126
I don't think we're talking
about the same thing.

43:39.160 --> 43:41.329
Well, what exactly
are we talking about?

43:45.132 --> 43:47.268
You boys'll excuse me
for just a moment.

43:55.109 --> 43:57.512
I want you to take
that sock in your pocket

43:57.545 --> 43:59.323
and I want you to swallow it,
do you understand?

43:59.347 --> 44:00.815
You're gonna get us both killed.

44:00.848 --> 44:02.683
It's not what you think.

44:02.717 --> 44:04.585
He's... he's more of a pencil.

44:08.222 --> 44:09.624
What the fuck
are you talking about?

44:09.657 --> 44:11.459
Meaning he's not the muscle.

44:13.794 --> 44:16.364
What are you writing, a play?

44:16.397 --> 44:17.698
Nobody talks like that.

44:20.468 --> 44:23.404
Look, August.

44:23.437 --> 44:27.742
Are you two familiar
with your very recent fame?

44:27.775 --> 44:29.744
What?

44:36.317 --> 44:38.352
It would seem

44:38.386 --> 44:40.555
that our ties are severed

44:40.588 --> 44:43.157
for the time being, boys.

44:43.190 --> 44:46.294
Can't have
that kind of attention.

44:46.327 --> 44:47.795
It's bad for business.

45:04.880 --> 45:06.747
I'll be needing that advance.

45:09.717 --> 45:12.520
When's the last time
you pulled a trigger,

45:12.553 --> 45:14.855
- Richie?
- August.

45:14.890 --> 45:17.224
Don't call me that.

45:17.258 --> 45:20.227
That's a nice gun, August.

45:20.261 --> 45:22.597
Looks new.

45:22.630 --> 45:25.833
Or is just unused?

45:25.866 --> 45:27.401
I will, don't think I won't.

45:27.435 --> 45:29.637
You don't know
who we're tangled with.

45:29.670 --> 45:32.740
I know more than you think.

45:32.773 --> 45:34.675
Now, put the fucking gun down.

45:40.882 --> 45:43.818
Promise me you'll help us.

45:43.851 --> 45:45.753
I already am.

45:51.258 --> 45:53.561
Sorry, boys.

45:53.594 --> 45:55.429
I got a new friend.

46:21.689 --> 46:23.449
He keeps the money in the trunk,
look around.

48:24.712 --> 48:28.549
There's a cold, cold circle
that wells up in your guts

48:28.582 --> 48:32.353
just prior to any moment
that's worth a damn.

48:33.989 --> 48:37.993
And that's the thing
about violence:

48:38.026 --> 48:39.928
Sometimes it's quiet.

49:34.950 --> 49:37.518
Hey!

49:37.551 --> 49:40.055
Turn around!

49:40.088 --> 49:41.923
Slow.

49:46.794 --> 49:49.064
Stop!

49:53.567 --> 49:56.071
That would be unwise, friend.

49:56.104 --> 49:58.907
I said, "Stop!"

50:02.810 --> 50:05.646
Stop!

50:10.517 --> 50:13.021
Stop, you crazy son of a bitch!

50:13.054 --> 50:15.023
Stop!

50:32.606 --> 50:33.774
I need you both to relax.

50:39.747 --> 50:40.949
How'd you do that?

50:48.822 --> 50:51.525
Who are you?

50:51.558 --> 50:54.628
Alexander Aleksy.

50:56.830 --> 50:59.134
Where's the money?

50:59.167 --> 51:01.002
Walked right past it.

51:13.614 --> 51:16.117
"Dear Jimmy,

51:16.151 --> 51:17.718
Let's talk about the future.

51:17.751 --> 51:19.653
Drinks on me.

51:19.687 --> 51:21.655
Love,

51:21.689 --> 51:23.224
"Alexander Aleksy."

51:25.592 --> 51:28.129
You're early.

51:28.163 --> 51:30.899
What's all this about Jimmy?

51:30.932 --> 51:32.968
- I'm in love with his work.
- You don't know

51:33.001 --> 51:35.569
- who you're tangled with.
- Of course I do.

51:35.602 --> 51:37.038
I know him
better than you, August.

51:40.008 --> 51:41.608
How do you know my name?

51:47.048 --> 51:49.084
43.

51:49.117 --> 51:52.921
That's you, right?

51:52.954 --> 51:55.256
You spend much time

51:55.290 --> 51:57.658
in France?

52:04.032 --> 52:05.766
Where'd you get this?

52:05.799 --> 52:08.736
Forgive me, I altered
the buttons, less formal.

52:13.241 --> 52:14.775
Hang on.

52:14.808 --> 52:16.911
I will grab my things
and I will explain.

52:19.613 --> 52:21.715
What about Jonas?

52:21.749 --> 52:24.618
You almost killed him.

52:24.651 --> 52:26.754
- No, I did not.
- You tied him to a block of ice.

52:26.787 --> 52:29.257
Ice in October.

52:29.290 --> 52:31.159
How do I get ice in October?

52:39.901 --> 52:41.802
Hang on to that.

52:41.835 --> 52:43.604
I will explain.

52:58.019 --> 52:59.330
You can't leave me,
I swear to God.

52:59.354 --> 53:01.655
Please, please,
this is killing me.

53:01.688 --> 53:03.358
August.

53:03.391 --> 53:05.193
Ow.

53:14.768 --> 53:16.204
Wait.

53:16.237 --> 53:18.106
Wait, August!

53:18.139 --> 53:19.807
Aleksy,
I'm gonna fucking kill you,

53:19.840 --> 53:21.242
do you understand me?

53:24.112 --> 53:25.980
August.

53:26.014 --> 53:28.649
Stop.

53:31.386 --> 53:34.089
Are you done?

53:34.122 --> 53:35.789
Why?

53:35.823 --> 53:37.992
This can't happen, please can...?

53:38.026 --> 53:41.795
I'll fucking kill you.

53:44.265 --> 53:46.101
As soon as I get out
of this rope,

53:46.134 --> 53:49.003
I'm gonna chop
your fucking head off.

54:00.181 --> 54:01.748
Breathe, breathe.

54:05.887 --> 54:07.188
Do you see anything?

54:10.724 --> 54:13.094
I know you two are raw

54:13.128 --> 54:14.795
about your father.

54:14.828 --> 54:16.797
I know,

54:16.830 --> 54:19.067
but you haven't given me
a chance to explain myself.

54:19.100 --> 54:20.667
You stomped the piss out of him.

54:20.701 --> 54:24.405
- No, I did not.
- You gave him frostbite.

54:24.439 --> 54:26.207
No frostbite,
you know better than that.

54:28.443 --> 54:30.311
You know better
than that, August.

54:30.345 --> 54:32.347
How do you know
I know better, huh?

54:32.380 --> 54:34.282
How do you know I know better?

54:34.315 --> 54:36.084
Fuck do you know?

54:45.960 --> 54:48.163
- I wanna be your friend.
- You wanna be my friend?

54:48.196 --> 54:50.098
Yes, I told you not to run away.

54:52.167 --> 54:54.903
Are we done running away now?

54:56.803 --> 54:59.307
Stop crying.

54:59.340 --> 55:02.243
Breathe.

55:02.277 --> 55:05.213
Tell your brother
to stop crying.

55:05.246 --> 55:08.116
He's a free man,
he can do what he wants.

55:08.149 --> 55:09.284
He's not free.

55:11.319 --> 55:13.154
He is tied.

55:18.927 --> 55:21.462
Oh.

55:21.496 --> 55:24.399
It wasn't ice, it...

55:24.432 --> 55:25.799
It was jars.

55:27.868 --> 55:29.770
- Jars?
- A trick, yes.

55:31.339 --> 55:32.773
What are you talking about?

55:32.806 --> 55:34.841
It was a trick.

56:35.970 --> 56:38.373
You met Edith?

56:38.406 --> 56:41.342
You met Edith, right?

56:41.376 --> 56:44.312
- I met Edith.
- You met Edith, fine.

56:44.345 --> 56:46.914
I know Edith.

56:46.948 --> 56:49.317
- No you don't.
- No, I don't.

56:49.350 --> 56:51.852
No, she helped me out.

56:51.886 --> 56:54.055
- It's a lie.
- It's not a lie.

56:54.088 --> 56:56.090
- You're trying to trick me.
- No, no I'm not...

56:56.124 --> 56:58.960
I'm not trying to trick you,
I'm trying to help you.

57:00.561 --> 57:03.298
But, you don't give me
the chance to explain myself,

57:03.331 --> 57:07.935
so I have to do these things
that I really don't wanna do.

57:07.969 --> 57:09.270
I don't wanna do this.

57:12.507 --> 57:14.542
You're wrapped in a flag

57:14.575 --> 57:18.379
that is stretched too thin
to be a blanket.

57:18.413 --> 57:20.114
We all got frostbite.

57:22.083 --> 57:23.484
We starve to death,

57:23.518 --> 57:27.255
while the top
gives his scraps to the dogs.

57:28.490 --> 57:31.076
No going back...

57:32.036 --> 57:33.207
I know.

57:36.874 --> 57:39.960
Be careful my darling.

57:40.068 --> 57:42.370
And they take it
out of our mouths,

57:42.403 --> 57:44.272
after we chew it for 'em.

57:48.910 --> 57:51.446
You know I'm right.

58:01.489 --> 58:04.292
I don't like blood.

58:04.325 --> 58:06.427
I don't like those things.

58:07.662 --> 58:09.197
I want to help you out.

58:11.099 --> 58:13.534
- You want to help us out?
- Yes, I want to help you out.

58:14.702 --> 58:16.371
Then why'd you tie us up, huh?

58:16.404 --> 58:20.041
Because you were
running away, August.

58:20.074 --> 58:22.643
I told you not to run away.

58:25.480 --> 58:27.582
How do you know who he is?

58:29.117 --> 58:31.018
I know him from...

58:32.387 --> 58:36.057
a place in Indianapolis.

58:38.159 --> 58:40.461
That's where I met Jimmy.

58:43.097 --> 58:46.033
No. No.

58:46.067 --> 58:48.169
That's... no.

58:50.138 --> 58:52.640
No, why?

58:52.673 --> 58:55.977
- You're lying to me.
- No, I'm not lying.

58:56.010 --> 58:59.046
I'm not lying to you.

59:01.182 --> 59:03.351
How long have you known Jimmy?

59:03.384 --> 59:05.153
A long time.

59:14.395 --> 59:17.298
I want to give back your money.

59:17.331 --> 59:19.534
- Oh, yeah?
- I will.

59:21.669 --> 59:23.738
But I need your help.

59:26.040 --> 59:29.243
I know they're planning a heist.

59:30.745 --> 59:33.581
They're robbing a bank.

59:33.614 --> 59:37.351
You can get it, all of it.

59:39.520 --> 59:42.290
I miscalculated.

59:42.323 --> 59:45.026
I thought I could do this alone,
but I cannot.

59:45.059 --> 59:46.694
You want to take out Jimmy
and his men?

59:46.727 --> 59:48.629
Mm-hm.

59:52.600 --> 59:55.002
All together.

59:55.036 --> 59:57.138
Me, you, Reed.

59:59.307 --> 1:00:02.210
This is where we're going.

1:00:27.835 --> 1:00:29.570
You're a heavy sleeper.

1:00:32.373 --> 1:00:33.407
What...

1:00:33.441 --> 1:00:35.810
What is all this?

1:00:35.843 --> 1:00:37.178
It's just a couple of pals.

1:00:40.615 --> 1:00:41.582
We didn't want to wake you.

1:00:41.616 --> 1:00:43.618
You were snoozing awful pretty.

1:00:43.651 --> 1:00:45.186
I thought you let out.

1:00:45.219 --> 1:00:47.722
I didn't think
you were coming back.

1:00:47.755 --> 1:00:49.390
Well, just for the evening,
darling.

1:00:49.423 --> 1:00:53.327
We had to go pick up
a few things over in Peru.

1:00:53.361 --> 1:00:55.730
Well, I was not aware
we were expecting company.

1:00:55.763 --> 1:00:57.431
Um...

1:00:57.465 --> 1:00:59.367
I could open the Charlie up
for y'all.

1:00:59.400 --> 1:01:03.437
No, we, uh,
we like the fresh air.

1:01:03.471 --> 1:01:06.107
But...

1:01:06.140 --> 1:01:09.143
There's not enough beds here.

1:01:09.176 --> 1:01:10.578
We'll manage.

1:01:10.611 --> 1:01:13.180
It's just for a day or two.

1:01:15.416 --> 1:01:16.417
Where's Jonas?

1:01:16.450 --> 1:01:18.586
Boys...

1:01:18.619 --> 1:01:20.388
Where'd you put the old man?

1:01:20.421 --> 1:01:21.756
We took him out back.

1:01:21.789 --> 1:01:24.725
He was starting to stink.

1:01:37.838 --> 1:01:39.874
Boys...

1:01:39.908 --> 1:01:44.345
We are now toting more iron
than the U.S. Army.

1:01:45.446 --> 1:01:47.214
Jonas!

1:01:47.248 --> 1:01:48.382
Jonas.

1:01:48.416 --> 1:01:50.284
Oh, baby, I'm sorry.

1:01:50.318 --> 1:01:51.252
Come on, let's get you inside.

1:01:51.285 --> 1:01:53.187
No, baby, no, no, no, no.

1:01:53.220 --> 1:01:54.822
Don't leave me, stay with me.

1:01:54.855 --> 1:01:57.825
Just stay with me.

1:02:33.561 --> 1:02:36.530
You got him drying out out here?

1:02:36.564 --> 1:02:37.899
Listen, I already scolded 'em,

1:02:37.933 --> 1:02:40.534
I ran 'em over the coals for it.

1:02:40.568 --> 1:02:42.303
Why would they do that?

1:02:42.336 --> 1:02:44.305
Do what?

1:02:52.680 --> 1:02:55.583
He wasn't hurting anyone.

1:03:08.429 --> 1:03:09.740
Guys, this is bullshit,
I've been through this

1:03:09.764 --> 1:03:11.900
half a dozen times,
we know the route, right?

1:03:11.933 --> 1:03:12.867
We've got it.

1:03:12.901 --> 1:03:14.903
Who did the old man?

1:03:16.004 --> 1:03:17.638
Hm?

1:03:17.672 --> 1:03:18.974
I got a 22-caliber mistake...

1:03:19.007 --> 1:03:22.209
We don't use 22s.

1:03:22.243 --> 1:03:24.254
Yeah, well, there's a hole
in him about that big, clean.

1:03:24.278 --> 1:03:25.355
- It's not ours.
- Sounds like

1:03:25.379 --> 1:03:26.681
my last Friday night.

1:03:26.714 --> 1:03:29.350
- Don't start.
- Relax, it was a joke.

1:03:29.383 --> 1:03:30.886
I assure you,
this is not a joke.

1:03:30.919 --> 1:03:32.687
After Monday, you're free
to join the circus.

1:03:32.720 --> 1:03:34.355
You guys can buy
the fucking moon.

1:03:34.388 --> 1:03:35.856
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

1:03:35.891 --> 1:03:37.692
Who's Aleksy, huh?

1:03:37.725 --> 1:03:39.727
- Who's Aleksy?
- I'm taking care of it.

1:03:39.760 --> 1:03:43.899
Quit fucking chasing puss
and get your mind on business.

1:03:48.536 --> 1:03:51.272
Can you repeat the plan to me?

1:03:51.305 --> 1:03:54.842
2:30 p.m., south alley.

1:03:54.875 --> 1:03:56.978
Your brother is fast,
but he's wrong.

1:03:57.012 --> 1:03:59.380
He was an enigma.

1:03:59.413 --> 1:04:01.549
Strangest man I ever met

1:04:01.582 --> 1:04:04.318
and the first to trust me
with a pistol.

1:04:04.351 --> 1:04:06.320
That's correct. 2:45.

1:04:06.353 --> 1:04:08.556
Three steps ahead.

1:04:08.589 --> 1:04:10.524
That was his way.

1:04:10.558 --> 1:04:12.793
Equally sharp
in the art of bushwhacking

1:04:12.827 --> 1:04:14.628
as he was soothsaying.

1:04:16.597 --> 1:04:20.568
He gave us back Jimmy's 4,000
just like he said he would

1:04:20.601 --> 1:04:24.705
on assurances
that we'd be savvy to his plan.

1:04:25.974 --> 1:04:27.508
With the Depression on,

1:04:27.541 --> 1:04:30.678
just about everybody
was working on an angle.

1:04:30.711 --> 1:04:32.546
But I must admit,

1:04:32.580 --> 1:04:36.684
knocking off a bank robbery
never quite rang a bell.

1:04:36.717 --> 1:04:39.921
But our new friend
was talking major paper,

1:04:39.955 --> 1:04:43.424
kind you can buy
a new life with.

1:04:43.457 --> 1:04:46.694
What we didn't know
at the time was

1:04:46.727 --> 1:04:48.897
we might have to.

1:04:52.867 --> 1:04:54.602
Come on.

1:05:15.756 --> 1:05:17.893
- August?
- What?

1:05:19.928 --> 1:05:22.563
- Can you hurry up, please?
- August, am I gonna...

1:05:23.999 --> 1:05:26.433
Am I gonna have to kill someone?

1:05:28.069 --> 1:05:30.005
Will you come on?

1:05:32.606 --> 1:05:35.476
Don't play games now, come on.

1:05:39.480 --> 1:05:42.616
Keep your head out of your ass
for five seconds, please.

1:05:44.052 --> 1:05:47.354
"Am I gonna have
to kill somebody?"

1:05:49.690 --> 1:05:52.726
I mean, what do you think
is gonna happen?

1:05:55.396 --> 1:05:56.640
"Am I gonna
have to kill somebody?"

1:05:56.664 --> 1:05:58.532
No, I'll kill everybody,
I'll kill 'em all.

1:05:58.566 --> 1:05:59.567
Is that all right?

1:05:59.600 --> 1:06:00.640
You're just standing there

1:06:00.668 --> 1:06:02.770
with your fucking hand
up your ass!

1:06:02.803 --> 1:06:04.872
You're a big hero, is that it?

1:06:04.906 --> 1:06:05.840
You're a big, big hero.

1:06:05.873 --> 1:06:07.075
I never said I was a hero.

1:06:07.108 --> 1:06:09.410
Who said I was a hero?

1:06:09.443 --> 1:06:11.579
Who said I was a hero?

1:06:13.181 --> 1:06:14.883
That's in your head, all right?

1:06:14.916 --> 1:06:16.885
Ain't no war heroes here.

1:06:42.743 --> 1:06:44.478
You sure it's this way?

1:06:44.511 --> 1:06:46.014
I'm sure it's this way.

1:06:46.047 --> 1:06:48.682
All right, don't question.

1:06:58.726 --> 1:07:00.561
Come on.

1:07:26.021 --> 1:07:28.756
You carry that for a while?

1:07:31.126 --> 1:07:32.860
What's wrong with you?

1:07:32.894 --> 1:07:34.862
I'm fine.

1:07:34.896 --> 1:07:38.033
I'm fine, I'm just short
of breath, that's all.

1:07:42.203 --> 1:07:44.005
I think we're in
way over our heads here

1:07:44.039 --> 1:07:45.582
if you want to know
the God's honest truth.

1:07:45.606 --> 1:07:48.676
It... it just don't feel right.

1:07:50.844 --> 1:07:52.746
Look...

1:07:57.551 --> 1:08:00.055
We can go anywhere

1:08:00.088 --> 1:08:01.198
and we don't have to do
this thing.

1:08:01.222 --> 1:08:02.489
It's just you and me now.

1:08:02.523 --> 1:08:03.733
We go get Jonas,
we've got enough.

1:08:03.757 --> 1:08:04.858
We can just take off.

1:08:04.893 --> 1:08:07.728
No, that's not an option.

1:08:07.761 --> 1:08:10.098
4 or 5,000 ain't gonna cut it.

1:08:12.566 --> 1:08:16.537
I just don't think we're fit
for this kind of predicament.

1:08:16.570 --> 1:08:18.839
At least you ain't.

1:08:23.811 --> 1:08:27.248
That's not true, all right?

1:08:34.990 --> 1:08:37.025
I didn't mean it like that.

1:08:39.294 --> 1:08:42.496
I just don't want you to know
what it's like to get shot at.

1:08:44.332 --> 1:08:47.902
Well, at least we'll have
something to talk about.

1:08:47.936 --> 1:08:49.636
I'm serious.

1:08:49.670 --> 1:08:51.772
So am I.

1:09:00.581 --> 1:09:02.017
August...

1:09:03.650 --> 1:09:06.553
How come you never
tell me about it?

1:09:08.289 --> 1:09:10.058
What do you want to know?

1:09:11.692 --> 1:09:13.827
What it was like.

1:09:16.730 --> 1:09:21.169
I signed up and went to hell.

1:09:21.202 --> 1:09:23.771
What's there to talk about?

1:09:25.773 --> 1:09:28.176
Why didn't you come back?

1:09:30.278 --> 1:09:31.712
And do what?

1:09:33.181 --> 1:09:35.816
Hold down a broom?

1:09:35.849 --> 1:09:38.119
I was just a kid.

1:09:38.153 --> 1:09:40.754
And I've seen more killing
than the devil himself.

1:09:40.788 --> 1:09:42.790
A man don't quite fit
anyplace after that.

1:09:42.823 --> 1:09:45.226
No, that... that's not true.

1:09:46.961 --> 1:09:48.662
To be honest,

1:09:48.695 --> 1:09:52.599
I thought it was selfish.

1:09:52.633 --> 1:09:55.036
Selfish.

1:09:55.070 --> 1:09:58.139
We thought you were dead,
August.

1:10:03.044 --> 1:10:05.146
So did I.

1:10:16.790 --> 1:10:18.826
Hey, boys.

1:10:23.764 --> 1:10:24.999
You following us?

1:10:25.033 --> 1:10:28.036
No, no.

1:10:28.069 --> 1:10:30.972
I was just out in the woods.

1:10:31.005 --> 1:10:33.074
Just get bored out here.

1:10:34.741 --> 1:10:37.045
What are you doing, Aleksy?

1:10:40.381 --> 1:10:41.648
I don't know.

1:10:41.682 --> 1:10:43.351
I just like the air.

1:10:43.384 --> 1:10:46.154
Like space to think.

1:10:54.462 --> 1:10:55.997
Well, we better be going.

1:10:56.030 --> 1:10:59.234
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
where are you going?

1:10:59.267 --> 1:11:01.369
Where are you going?

1:11:01.402 --> 1:11:03.737
Like we planned,
that's where we're going.

1:11:03.770 --> 1:11:05.340
Where do you think we're going?

1:11:07.075 --> 1:11:08.809
So do you remember the plan?

1:11:08.842 --> 1:11:09.954
Of course we remember the plan.

1:11:09.978 --> 1:11:11.845
We've been over it many times.

1:11:11.880 --> 1:11:14.215
Repeat it to me now.

1:11:14.249 --> 1:11:17.152
2:45.

1:11:17.185 --> 1:11:18.286
The alley.

1:11:18.319 --> 1:11:20.255
What alley?

1:11:20.288 --> 1:11:22.891
- We're north.
- You're south.

1:11:22.924 --> 1:11:24.691
We know.

1:11:24.725 --> 1:11:26.693
I got him covered, don't worry.

1:11:26.727 --> 1:11:28.329
Okay.

1:11:30.431 --> 1:11:33.401
- Come on, August.
- It's in the body now, huh?

1:11:33.434 --> 1:11:35.436
Yeah, it's in the body.

1:11:37.205 --> 1:11:40.774
Take good care
of your brother, Reed.

1:11:42.477 --> 1:11:44.312
He don't take care of me,
all right?

1:11:44.345 --> 1:11:45.980
I take care of him.

1:11:46.014 --> 1:11:48.316
Come on, August.

1:13:50.871 --> 1:13:52.040
"Please know in your heart

1:13:52.073 --> 1:13:53.374
that I regret involving you both

1:13:53.408 --> 1:13:56.010
in whatever this ends up being.

1:13:57.211 --> 1:13:59.846
I failed you in so many ways.

1:14:01.382 --> 1:14:03.017
This pain that
you're undoubtedly feeling

1:14:03.051 --> 1:14:05.586
was never my intention.

1:14:05.620 --> 1:14:09.023
I know that I will likely
never be forgiven

1:14:09.057 --> 1:14:12.493
and that truth is wedged
deep down inside my ribs.

1:14:13.995 --> 1:14:17.031
I was with him
in his final moments.

1:14:17.065 --> 1:14:21.469
His comfort was found
knowing that you were together.

1:14:21.502 --> 1:14:24.572
Your father's final wound
was not of my hand

1:14:24.605 --> 1:14:26.274
but a man of Jimmy's outfit.

1:14:28.476 --> 1:14:31.279
I fell asleep
and woke to this brutality,

1:14:31.312 --> 1:14:33.314
and for that I am to blame.

1:14:35.950 --> 1:14:37.552
The weight of a life
does not balance

1:14:37.585 --> 1:14:39.153
the thirst some men have
for chasing

1:14:39.187 --> 1:14:41.456
the ever-elusive dollar

1:14:41.489 --> 1:14:45.360
or, in this case,
upwards of 75,000 of 'em.

1:14:48.162 --> 1:14:52.033
But I speak for myself
and Aleksy when I say...

1:14:53.267 --> 1:14:55.903
let's take it from them.

1:14:57.538 --> 1:15:00.308
My deepest condolences.

1:15:00.341 --> 1:15:02.343
"Edie."

1:15:58.599 --> 1:16:00.134
There you are.

1:16:00.168 --> 1:16:02.069
Where's my fucking money?

1:16:03.371 --> 1:16:05.239
Mm.

1:16:09.177 --> 1:16:11.045
- Please.
- I ain't got time for this.

1:16:11.078 --> 1:16:12.647
Sit down.

1:16:12.680 --> 1:16:15.283
I'll tell you where it is.

1:16:15.316 --> 1:16:17.118
This ain't a conversation.

1:16:17.151 --> 1:16:19.620
It sure seems like it.

1:16:19.654 --> 1:16:21.756
Sit down.

1:16:21.789 --> 1:16:24.392
I'll tell you where it is.

1:16:32.066 --> 1:16:33.501
You comfortable?

1:16:36.537 --> 1:16:40.141
Well, the rope is a little much.

1:16:42.543 --> 1:16:44.545
It would behoove you
to get this transaction

1:16:44.579 --> 1:16:46.781
in motion, son.

1:16:51.419 --> 1:16:54.622
Has anyone ever told you
that you look like Clark Gable?

1:16:54.655 --> 1:16:56.691
You do.

1:16:56.724 --> 1:16:59.727
A little older with
that mink on your lip.

1:17:05.700 --> 1:17:08.603
Hm?

1:17:08.636 --> 1:17:12.406
Do you know why fortune tellers

1:17:12.440 --> 1:17:15.009
use a crystal ball?

1:17:17.378 --> 1:17:19.447
Wait for this.

1:17:19.480 --> 1:17:21.782
Is this a fucking radio show?

1:17:21.816 --> 1:17:25.186
- I'm about to count to three.
- They use it

1:17:25.219 --> 1:17:29.824
because they want you
to look down to wonder

1:17:29.857 --> 1:17:32.527
a world on a different tilt

1:17:32.560 --> 1:17:36.430
while the man with the plan
looks right up and hits you.

1:17:37.865 --> 1:17:40.635
And the second you flinch

1:17:40.668 --> 1:17:42.637
at the royal subjects,

1:17:42.670 --> 1:17:45.306
they pounce on it.

1:17:46.607 --> 1:17:49.410
I got some big ideas, John.

1:17:51.212 --> 1:17:52.580
My name is Jimmy.

1:17:52.613 --> 1:17:54.649
We both know that's not true.

1:17:56.117 --> 1:17:57.818
I would know.

1:17:57.852 --> 1:18:00.388
I'm a big fan, obviously.

1:18:01.689 --> 1:18:05.560
We go way back,
but you don't remember.

1:18:08.362 --> 1:18:10.364
I could teach you some things.

1:18:10.398 --> 1:18:11.799
I sincerely doubt that.

1:18:11.832 --> 1:18:15.269
My feet never touch the ground.

1:18:15.303 --> 1:18:17.305
Since I was 17.

1:18:18.372 --> 1:18:20.474
Me and you.

1:18:22.310 --> 1:18:24.312
We can take over.

1:18:25.446 --> 1:18:27.515
Everything.

1:18:28.583 --> 1:18:30.685
Don't you see?

1:18:30.718 --> 1:18:33.721
I got the jackrabbit
all by himself.

1:18:35.523 --> 1:18:39.794
I lured you in
with wits and vinegar.

1:18:44.900 --> 1:18:47.768
You're clever, kid.

1:18:47.802 --> 1:18:50.471
I'll give you that.

1:18:50.504 --> 1:18:52.144
Hell, you've got
a devil-may-care attitude

1:18:52.173 --> 1:18:53.584
that's going to serve you well
in a pinch,

1:18:53.608 --> 1:18:55.543
but I'm gonna let you
right back down

1:18:55.576 --> 1:18:57.244
to where you belong.

1:18:57.278 --> 1:18:59.480
I ain't hiring.

1:19:02.683 --> 1:19:05.653
You're just like all the other
sweet tooth imposters.

1:19:05.686 --> 1:19:07.788
You think you know who I am?

1:19:07.822 --> 1:19:10.725
You think you do, but you don't.

1:19:10.758 --> 1:19:14.528
I do know who you are.

1:19:17.231 --> 1:19:20.468
You're Jesse James reincarnated.

1:19:20.501 --> 1:19:23.404
And I'm Alexander Aleksy.

1:19:23.437 --> 1:19:28.175
I lived two lifetimes
while you were in prison,

1:19:28.209 --> 1:19:32.647
crossed an ocean,
buried a father.

1:19:44.225 --> 1:19:46.694
I think you should hear me out.

1:19:56.337 --> 1:19:59.373
You know, I don't work
with Italians...

1:20:00.875 --> 1:20:02.543
nobody with a New York address,

1:20:02.576 --> 1:20:05.746
and certainly no kid
fresh off the fucking boat.

1:20:05.780 --> 1:20:07.848
Now you keep telling me
you got ideas,

1:20:07.883 --> 1:20:10.651
but I ain't heard one.

1:20:10.685 --> 1:20:14.956
A bird told me you were in Peru.

1:20:16.357 --> 1:20:19.760
Got all sorts of gifts,
don't you?

1:20:19.794 --> 1:20:22.229
Why don't you give me
one or two?

1:20:23.364 --> 1:20:24.565
What are you doing?

1:21:01.836 --> 1:21:03.972
See you on Monday.

1:21:05.339 --> 1:21:09.276
Jimmy, I see you on Monday!

1:24:21.102 --> 1:24:23.604
Oh my God!

1:25:43.185 --> 1:25:44.853
I think we've gone too far.

1:25:48.065 --> 1:25:50.526
We're almost finished my love.

1:26:22.623 --> 1:26:24.325
We need to get off the map.

1:26:25.927 --> 1:26:28.063
I need to do this.

1:26:29.663 --> 1:26:31.199
Then let's do it.

1:26:31.232 --> 1:26:33.134
- Us.
- No.

1:26:34.969 --> 1:26:36.113
I don't need you
getting killed too.

1:26:36.137 --> 1:26:37.571
I'll go alone.

1:26:39.673 --> 1:26:42.810
There's nothing you're gonna
say or do that'll stop me.

1:26:44.145 --> 1:26:46.613
This ain't playing cowboys.

1:26:46.647 --> 1:26:50.118
When the lead is flying,
there's real consequences.

1:26:52.153 --> 1:26:54.189
I'm your brother

1:26:54.222 --> 1:26:57.092
and I've got your back.

1:26:57.125 --> 1:26:59.894
You got it wrong
from the outset.

1:26:59.928 --> 1:27:04.165
In war, nobody wins,
it just says so on paper.

1:27:10.238 --> 1:27:11.248
You know, you're not
the only one

1:27:11.272 --> 1:27:14.641
that gets to mean something.

1:27:25.719 --> 1:27:28.289
You still don't get it.

1:29:08.957 --> 1:29:10.525
Back away.

1:29:12.327 --> 1:29:13.895
What are you doing?

1:29:17.966 --> 1:29:20.902
Let me do this.

1:29:20.935 --> 1:29:23.371
You're making a mistake.

1:29:23.404 --> 1:29:25.872
Let me make it.

1:30:14.088 --> 1:30:16.090
Reed, no!

1:30:31.639 --> 1:30:34.342
I don't know what
I'm doing wrong.

1:30:34.375 --> 1:30:35.486
Maybe we should get
the kid something

1:30:35.510 --> 1:30:37.578
to get his confidence up.

1:30:37.612 --> 1:30:41.349
Then we can work our way down
to a fly's pecker.

1:30:41.382 --> 1:30:42.849
Why don't we leave the shooting

1:30:42.884 --> 1:30:44.552
to the ones
who've done it before?

1:30:44.585 --> 1:30:46.988
Not everybody is a sharpshooter.

1:30:48.423 --> 1:30:51.025
Why don't you try that one on?

1:30:51.059 --> 1:30:53.194
See how that goes.

1:30:58.666 --> 1:31:00.068
That thing is ancient.

1:31:00.101 --> 1:31:01.336
It's only got one shot.

1:31:01.369 --> 1:31:02.579
What good is that
gonna do anybody?

1:31:02.603 --> 1:31:05.406
He just needs one shot.

1:31:11.979 --> 1:31:13.424
That thing will blow
your shoulder clean off

1:31:13.448 --> 1:31:14.549
if you ain't got it snug.

1:31:14.582 --> 1:31:17.285
He's not wrong.

1:31:17.318 --> 1:31:19.420
Hold it tight.

1:31:32.934 --> 1:31:34.001
You all right?

1:31:34.035 --> 1:31:36.304
Woo!

1:31:36.337 --> 1:31:37.605
Oh.

1:31:37.638 --> 1:31:40.241
Ohh.

1:31:40.274 --> 1:31:42.310
You still missed, but...

1:31:42.343 --> 1:31:44.078
I like this.

1:31:45.613 --> 1:31:47.248
Give me that.

1:31:51.452 --> 1:31:53.154
Here.

1:31:53.187 --> 1:31:55.056
You take that.

1:31:55.089 --> 1:31:56.691
I'm gonna hold on to this.

1:37:16.844 --> 1:37:18.947
Hello, John.

1:37:22.316 --> 1:37:24.385
What are you doing here?

1:37:24.418 --> 1:37:26.687
Saying thank you.

1:37:28.422 --> 1:37:30.558
I had the time of my life.

1:37:31.960 --> 1:37:34.862
You coming and...

1:37:34.896 --> 1:37:36.731
asking for money
at people's bedsides now?

1:37:36.764 --> 1:37:38.833
Why don't you sit up?

1:37:38.866 --> 1:37:43.404
Or are you just gonna lie there
like a coward?

1:37:45.806 --> 1:37:46.807
What do you need, son?

1:37:46.841 --> 1:37:48.542
I'm talking to you.

1:37:48.576 --> 1:37:51.345
Can you hear me?

1:37:53.447 --> 1:37:55.649
Where's your gun?

1:37:55.683 --> 1:37:57.052
Idiot.

1:37:58.519 --> 1:38:00.889
Could be dead right now.

1:38:00.922 --> 1:38:03.491
- What are you waiting for?
- Have some respect.

1:38:04.825 --> 1:38:06.794
I'm sparing your life.

1:38:08.362 --> 1:38:09.898
Is that what you think
you're doing?

1:38:09.931 --> 1:38:13.935
I got fucking green fields
than most guys ahead of me.

1:38:13.969 --> 1:38:14.970
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

1:38:17.338 --> 1:38:19.640
Shut the fuck up.

1:38:24.845 --> 1:38:27.015
You're just a little boy.

1:38:28.917 --> 1:38:31.585
It's Alexander Aleksy,

1:38:31.619 --> 1:38:34.421
spelled K-S-Y.

1:38:37.491 --> 1:38:38.994
Don't forget.

1:38:40.494 --> 1:38:43.098
Got a lot of things going on.

1:38:45.399 --> 1:38:48.036
Can I have this coat?

1:38:48.069 --> 1:38:48.904
What?

1:38:48.937 --> 1:38:50.871
Can I have the coat?

1:38:52.140 --> 1:38:54.542
What do I get for it in return?

1:38:55.576 --> 1:38:57.611
I trade you.

1:38:59.547 --> 1:39:01.883
St. Louis seven.

1:39:06.854 --> 1:39:11.026
I see you in the funny papers.

1:39:15.529 --> 1:39:17.798
That's where you belong.

1:39:22.636 --> 1:39:24.940
Goodnight.

1:40:05.046 --> 1:40:07.681
It's a shame we all got split.

1:40:07.715 --> 1:40:10.952
Think what we could've been
if we got away with it.

1:40:12.720 --> 1:40:16.724
Things have been slow
the last few months, but...

1:40:16.757 --> 1:40:18.459
then again, nothing will be

1:40:18.492 --> 1:40:21.795
quite as exciting ever again,
will they?

1:40:25.100 --> 1:40:29.637
I never returned
that wad of cash to the safe.

1:40:30.939 --> 1:40:33.440
I put in my mattress,
just in case.

1:40:48.856 --> 1:40:52.093
I did get a plot
next to Ma with it, though.

1:40:53.527 --> 1:40:55.663
I thought you'd like that.

1:40:57.798 --> 1:40:59.901
Been saving the rest
for the right occasion.

1:41:07.508 --> 1:41:09.843
Every time that door
swings open,

1:41:09.877 --> 1:41:11.779
I think it's gonna be him,

1:41:11.812 --> 1:41:16.650
but it's just echoes
of those rowdy days.

1:41:32.000 --> 1:41:34.936
"Hey grocery boy,

1:41:34.970 --> 1:41:37.973
sorry about your busted wing.

1:41:38.006 --> 1:41:41.142
But it is half your fault,
you know?

1:41:41.176 --> 1:41:44.980
Turns out you and your brother
share the same brain.

1:41:45.013 --> 1:41:48.549
That's better than none at all,
I guess.

1:41:49.783 --> 1:41:51.987
Take this to the courthouse.

1:41:52.020 --> 1:41:55.789
Have them forward it
to Mr. Purvis.

1:41:55.823 --> 1:41:58.826
They will know who that is.

1:42:00.328 --> 1:42:03.064
Should pay a pretty penny
for it.

1:42:04.899 --> 1:42:08.069
"Consider it a medal
for your valiant effort."

1:42:25.786 --> 1:42:27.989
J. Edgar and his federal brigade
finally catch up

1:42:28.023 --> 1:42:29.333
to public enemy number one,
John Dillinger.

1:42:29.357 --> 1:42:32.726
And as he's slain in Chicago,

1:42:32.760 --> 1:42:34.862
a crowd of hundreds gathered
round to catch a glimpse

1:42:34.896 --> 1:42:37.999
of the famed bank robber
laying in his own blood,

1:42:38.033 --> 1:42:41.136
led to death by a mystery woman
in a scarlet dress.

1:42:48.809 --> 1:42:51.879
Turns out the federal bureau
can do quite a lot

1:42:51.913 --> 1:42:53.314
in the way of crime fighting

1:42:53.348 --> 1:42:56.784
with something as trivial
as a coat.

1:42:56.817 --> 1:42:59.853
That's how they located
our old pal, Jimmy,

1:42:59.888 --> 1:43:03.657
or I guess I should say
Mr. Dillinger.

1:43:03.690 --> 1:43:06.995
Our brush with history
was quite extravagant,

1:43:07.028 --> 1:43:10.365
but it was Edie that had
the front-row seat.

1:43:10.398 --> 1:43:13.667
She was the one
that led 'em to him

1:43:13.700 --> 1:43:17.238
and saw the bullet
pass through his brain.

1:43:17.272 --> 1:43:19.773
I knew she was the daring sort,

1:43:19.807 --> 1:43:22.310
but I had no idea she was
in that tight of cahoots

1:43:22.343 --> 1:43:24.112
with the big scheme.

1:43:25.646 --> 1:43:29.184
She put a lot of ink
on the newsstands.

1:43:29.217 --> 1:43:31.352
And I venture to guess

1:43:31.386 --> 1:43:34.655
she was paid handsomely
for her endeavor.

1:44:27.808 --> 1:44:30.145
You made it.

1:44:31.279 --> 1:44:33.348
But you're early.

1:44:45.859 --> 1:44:47.929
How are you holding up, kid?

1:44:49.497 --> 1:44:51.765
I'm all right.

1:44:51.798 --> 1:44:53.700
They pay you?

1:44:55.069 --> 1:44:56.837
Five hundred dollars
for the coat.

1:44:56.870 --> 1:44:58.872
Five hundred dollars?

1:44:58.907 --> 1:45:01.675
That Hoover is a cheap
son of a bitch.

1:45:03.077 --> 1:45:06.147
I have something for you.

1:45:06.181 --> 1:45:07.882
Here.

1:45:09.918 --> 1:45:10.952
Take this.

1:45:10.985 --> 1:45:12.786
- I can't.
- Take it.

1:45:12.819 --> 1:45:14.189
Take it.

1:45:14.222 --> 1:45:18.825
Buy yourself a softer pillow
to sleep on.

1:45:18.859 --> 1:45:21.862
It's a ticket
to anywhere you want.

1:45:26.301 --> 1:45:28.203
You see the news?

1:45:30.104 --> 1:45:33.041
- I don't read newspapers.
- I know.

1:45:33.074 --> 1:45:35.443
Look.

1:45:35.476 --> 1:45:37.145
It's old news.

1:45:38.913 --> 1:45:41.316
Look.

1:45:41.349 --> 1:45:44.352
I know, Reed.

1:45:50.857 --> 1:45:53.127
So what do you say?

1:45:54.529 --> 1:45:57.098
You looking for work?

1:45:59.100 --> 1:46:01.536
No.

1:46:03.071 --> 1:46:05.039
I have a boat to catch.

1:46:06.274 --> 1:46:08.910
So this is goodbye.

1:46:29.197 --> 1:46:30.898
Hey.

1:46:33.601 --> 1:46:36.304
You forgot something.

1:46:46.347 --> 1:46:48.316
Thank you.

1:47:04.432 --> 1:47:09.270
He was only 17
when he set off for glory.

1:47:09.304 --> 1:47:13.107
The truth is, we ain't spoke
outside a letter

1:47:13.141 --> 1:47:17.378
since I was about eight,
maybe nine.

1:47:17.412 --> 1:47:19.447
That's a long time.

1:47:21.316 --> 1:47:25.286
So I figured this way
we can be together,

1:47:25.320 --> 1:47:28.556
doing all the things
we might have missed out on

1:47:28.589 --> 1:47:30.892
or at least my version of it.

1:47:30.925 --> 1:47:33.361
Those years might be gone,

1:47:33.394 --> 1:47:37.432
but pen to paper,
that's forever.

1:47:39.067 --> 1:47:42.003
I loaded it up to the brim

1:47:42.036 --> 1:47:46.274
with just about everything
I never got to say.

1:47:46.307 --> 1:47:50.078
So, my only request

1:47:50.111 --> 1:47:54.182
is that you pay mind
to the details of my story

1:47:54.215 --> 1:47:56.884
and hope we see eye to eye
in the end.

1:48:09.430 --> 1:48:13.201
Never thought I'd make it
across the Atlantic.

1:48:13.234 --> 1:48:16.571
Shoot, I ain't been much
outside of Wabash County.

1:48:18.673 --> 1:48:22.043
A lot of boys never came back
from that Great War...

1:48:23.678 --> 1:48:26.147
including my brother.

1:48:27.615 --> 1:48:30.084
So I went to him.

1:48:32.653 --> 1:48:35.156
We had a lot to catch up on.

1:49:17.098 --> 1:49:18.633
Hey!

1:49:18.666 --> 1:49:21.202
Can I help you?

1:49:21.235 --> 1:49:24.205
Uh, I'm looking for Track Five?

1:49:24.238 --> 1:49:27.308
Well, this is Track Three,
you'll be two over.

1:49:28.743 --> 1:49:31.579
- Uh...
- Bring it here.

1:49:35.750 --> 1:49:38.152
Well, that's a five all right.

1:49:39.620 --> 1:49:41.689
What's this here?
I ain't seen this.

1:49:41.722 --> 1:49:44.292
It's an Atlantic travel voucher.

1:49:44.325 --> 1:49:46.294
There's two of you?

1:49:49.764 --> 1:49:53.367
Atlantic, well,
that's Dock Three.

1:49:53.401 --> 1:49:56.404
That's around five,
you're in the right place.

1:49:58.139 --> 1:50:02.743
You aware that's
the institutional transport?

1:50:05.413 --> 1:50:07.048
They're nuts.

1:50:08.483 --> 1:50:10.318
Good luck.

1:50:33.241 --> 1:50:34.308
Hey. Hey, wait.

1:50:39.747 --> 1:50:43.184
I'm, uh, I'm his brother.

1:50:43.217 --> 1:50:46.153
Moi, uh, brother.

1:50:50.458 --> 1:50:52.727
Seventeen.

1:51:28.462 --> 1:51:30.665
Um, I don't...

1:51:32.433 --> 1:51:34.602
I don't...

1:51:34.635 --> 1:51:37.605
I'm sorry, I don't know
what you're saying.

1:51:45.813 --> 1:51:47.582
Uh...

1:51:49.684 --> 1:51:53.154
Hey.

1:51:53.187 --> 1:51:55.356
It's me.

1:51:55.389 --> 1:51:57.458
Let's go home.

1:51:58.826 --> 1:52:01.696
It's all right, it's all right.

1:53:16.370 --> 1:53:20.274
I made sure that everything
is all in place for you.

1:53:28.016 --> 1:53:30.718
You won't have to say
anything else.

1:53:33.487 --> 1:53:35.656
It's all in there.

1:53:42.596 --> 1:53:45.800
"My name is Alexander Aleksy..."

1:53:47.535 --> 1:53:51.539
Spelled K-S-Y.

1:53:53.374 --> 1:53:56.711
"You will not forget me
when I disappear."
