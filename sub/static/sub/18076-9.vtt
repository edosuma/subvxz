NARRATOR: In 1972, a crack commando unit
was sent to prison by a military court...

00:05.807 --> 00:07.320
for a crime they didn't commit.

00:07.407 --> 00:10.240
These men promptly escaped
from a maximum security stockade...

00:10.327 --> 00:11.806
to the Los Angeles underground.

00:11.887 --> 00:15.402
Today, still wanted by the government,
they survive as soldiers of fortune.

00:15.487 --> 00:17.842
If you have a problem,
if no one else can help...

00:17.927 --> 00:21.317
and if you can find them,
maybe you can hire the A-Team.

02:15.927 --> 02:18.361

outside the restricted area...

02:18.447 --> 02:21.007

DOUG: Yeah.

02:23.007 --> 02:24.042
Dad.

02:33.887 --> 02:37.277
Garber, you're on my dock.
It's private property. Get off!

02:37.367 --> 02:40.677
I don't like it when people
try to sabotage my boats, Mayer.

02:40.767 --> 02:44.521
Sabotage? We didn't come within 500 yards.

02:44.927 --> 02:47.964
We took pictures,
we checked the lobster beds underneath.

02:48.047 --> 02:49.560
Now, we've been watching you.

02:49.647 --> 02:52.764
We have evidence to prove
you're destroying the future of this bay.

02:52.847 --> 02:54.678
But we wouldn't touch your boats.

02:54.767 --> 02:57.122
When we stop you, Garber,
we're gonna do it legal.

02:57.207 --> 02:59.198
You got a big mouth, kid.

02:59.767 --> 03:01.485
But I'll give you a break.

03:01.807 --> 03:04.605
I'll let you stay in business,
provided you accept my deal.

03:04.687 --> 03:08.282

like everyone else around here?

03:08.367 --> 03:09.880

Now, you better talk some sense into them...

03:35.767 --> 03:39.043
before somebody finds them washed up
on one of these beaches down here.

in critical condition.

that we move him...

Yeah. And as soon as Garber's done
ripping off this place...

08:53.287 --> 08:56.040
he'll just slither up the coast
in his fancy boats...

08:56.127 --> 08:59.756
and wreck someplace else
where people have fished for a generation.

09:00.247 --> 09:01.760
All he cares about is profits.

09:01.847 --> 09:03.724
And once he's wiped out the lobster beds...

09:03.807 --> 09:06.605
there's no way they'll be able
to replenish themselves, right?

09:06.687 --> 09:07.756
That's right.

09:07.847 --> 09:09.883
But I thought nature
always replenished itself.

09:09.967 --> 09:13.243
It does. I mean, look at me.
A few years ago, I was a basket case.

09:13.327 --> 09:15.636
It depends on how much
you take from nature, Amy.

09:15.727 --> 09:16.955
And how much you leave behind.

09:17.047 --> 09:18.765
DOUG: Garber isn't gonna leave anything.

09:18.847 --> 09:21.839
If it was just he and his men
there couldn't be too much damage.

09:21.927 --> 09:24.805
Yeah, but he makes the fishermen
give him half their profits.

09:24.887 --> 09:27.799
So they have to fish twice as much
just to stay alive.

09:27.887 --> 09:29.525
Straight extortion.

If the working people don't pay Garber,
he breaks their arms.

I wouldn't be surprised if next time
he tries to kill us.

09:38.007 --> 09:41.124
I'm not so sure
he hasn't already killed our father.

09:43.367 --> 09:45.562
Maybe he's gonna beat us this time after all.

09:45.647 --> 09:47.080

12:59.607 --> 13:00.881
Yeah, we started helping Dad...

as soon as we were old enough
to wrestle a lobster from a trap.

13:03.927 --> 13:05.246
HANNIBAL: How is your father?

13:05.327 --> 13:07.636
I don't know.
Shana's with him at a hospital in L.A.

13:07.727 --> 13:09.558
Said she'd call if she found out anything.

13:09.647 --> 13:12.161
I can't figure out why
some of the people around here...

13:12.247 --> 13:15.000
don't help you take
the bend out of Garber's hook a little.

13:15.087 --> 13:16.884
FACE: Stand up to him.
DOUG: They're scared.

13:16.967 --> 13:19.800
Anybody who's tried to fight him
got hurt bad and gave up.

13:19.887 --> 13:21.639
And those who went along with him...

13:21.727 --> 13:24.241
they stayed in business,
but they had to give him a cut.

13:24.327 --> 13:26.887
Half the profits. Pretty deep cut.

13:26.967 --> 13:28.082
DOUG: Yeah.

13:29.727 --> 13:31.399
How do you deal with a man like this?

13:31.487 --> 13:34.365
I mean, my father's in the hospital,
hanging on by a thread.

13:34.447 --> 13:36.438
I want to stop Garber...

13:36.527 --> 13:38.722
but I don't want to lose my family
in the process.

13:38.807 --> 13:40.604
We're sorry about your father.

13:40.687 --> 13:42.678
We can't do anything about that.

13:42.927 --> 13:44.599
But we can do the next best thing.

13:44.687 --> 13:46.086
And we'll do it to Garber.

13:46.167 --> 13:49.523
Thanks, but I couldn't ask you to do that.
It's too risky.

13:49.607 --> 13:52.758
You don't have to ask us.
Guys like Garber attract us.

what are we gonna do?

I think it's time for Mr. Garber to learn
a lesson in the survival of the toughest.

14:02.447 --> 14:05.405
B.A., what do the repairs
on this boat look like?

14:05.887 --> 14:09.163
It won't be easy, man.
I checked the engine. It looked pretty bad.

14:09.247 --> 14:11.886
Doug, is there a marine supply house
around here?

14:11.967 --> 14:15.960

half a mile down by the wharf.

14:16.887 --> 14:20.482
DOUG: But he won't sell us anything.
He's in Garber's back pocket.

It's gonna be no problem at all.

15:09.527 --> 15:12.166
Nice dog. What breed is he, piranha?

15:14.927 --> 15:17.043
Say, Mr. Hagopian...

15:17.807 --> 15:19.798
we need some fibreglass for a busted hull...

15:19.887 --> 15:23.846

that's for an inboard, not an outboard...

15:23.927 --> 15:26.077

15:26.167 --> 15:28.362
Look, pal, this is a real small town.

15:28.447 --> 15:31.723
Only one boat around here
needs the kind of stuff you're talking about.

15:31.807 --> 15:35.004
And the fellow I work for says
that boat stays just the way it is.

15:35.087 --> 15:36.998
So it looks like I'm all out of everything.

right over there.

- And you're saying it's gone?
- I'm saying I sell to who I want to.

15:42.887 --> 15:46.675
Now, you better get off my property
before I turn Cutter loose on you.

15:47.327 --> 15:50.125
You should learn to use your anger
more constructively.

15:50.207 --> 15:51.356

I think we ought to bust this guy's rudder.

15:54.327 --> 15:55.442
Easy, B.A.

15:55.527 --> 15:57.722
I'm sure Mr. Hagopian's just a little cranky...

15:57.807 --> 16:00.924
because he got tired
polishing all these nifty boats.

16:01.407 --> 16:04.797
I'm sure he'll give us just what we want
at the price we want.

he'll go inside and call Garber.

16:20.807 --> 16:22.035
I certainly hope so.

the people of Lobster Bay $300,000.

He's just keeping them on low beam...

42:08.087 --> 42:11.602
so he don't end up in a bisque somewhere...

42:11.687 --> 42:13.564
in some sleazy restaurant.

42:13.647 --> 42:14.762
You don't hear no vibes.

42:14.847 --> 42:17.805

FACE: Come on, give the man a break.

42:19.487 --> 42:21.796

42:27.567 --> 42:31.196
The man said, "Give the man a break,"
so give me a break!

42:31.287 --> 42:32.925
How about I give you a ride?

42:33.007 --> 42:36.238
You want to be like the fish so much,
why don't you join them?

42:41.887 --> 42:44.606
He did it! I don't believe he did it!

42:45.407 --> 42:49.195
- Now, vibe on that, sucker!
- Vibe on that?
