Hey.

00:11.756 --> 00:14.997
I need to be at the club by 11:00,
so I can't really talk.

00:15.032 --> 00:17.011
Uh [Scoffs] skip it?

00:17.031 --> 00:19.935
But everyone who's
anyone is gonna be there.

00:19.987 --> 00:22.052
Mm. I know.

00:22.072 --> 00:23.914
Look, I really got to go.

00:23.934 --> 00:26.179
But I'll be thinking about you.

00:26.244 --> 00:29.012
I'll take a pic and send
it to you to prove it.

Excellent. Now hum. Mmm. Mmm.

Vibrate, vibrate, vibrate, vibrate.

01:08.586 --> 01:10.016
[Babbling] Okay.

01:10.036 --> 01:11.387
- Now, breathing...
- Okay, no, I think...

01:11.439 --> 01:13.961
I think that's... my vocal cords are
about as warmed up as they're gonna get.

01:13.981 --> 01:14.830
Thank you so much.

01:14.850 --> 01:16.245
I thought you said you were
just coming to watch, anyway.

01:16.265 --> 01:17.362
Well, that was the plan,

01:17.382 --> 01:19.248
but then I discovered
my expertise was needed.

01:19.268 --> 01:21.246
And don't miss his forehead, honey.

01:21.266 --> 01:22.484
It's shiny. What about this jacket, dear?

01:22.504 --> 01:24.081
- Did you choose...
- Yes. I-I'm good. I'm... y...

01:24.101 --> 01:26.666
I picked that out myself, thank you.
Because...

01:26.686 --> 01:28.974
[Stammers] I've done this before, mother.
I know exactly what I'm doing.

01:28.994 --> 01:31.989
Thank you. Go ahead and just put one more.
Just another layer.

01:32.009 --> 01:33.942
Stack them right up on top of there.
I think it'll be great.

01:33.978 --> 01:35.878
There's a boy over there
filming you with his phone.

01:35.930 --> 01:38.152
Yeah, that's just behind-the-scenes stuff.

01:38.172 --> 01:38.814
- Oh.
- Yeah.

01:38.866 --> 01:41.116
It's all part of the campaign.
Just tapping into

Mr. Castle, we're ready.

01:48.277 --> 01:49.571

01:49.591 --> 01:51.542
- Whoo-hoo, moe.
- Perfect.

01:54.746 --> 01:56.377
- We're rolling.
- All right.

01:56.397 --> 01:58.097
And action!

01:59.065 --> 02:01.398
Hi. I'm Richard Castle.

02:01.869 --> 02:03.338
Are you looking for a bone-chilling,

02:03.358 --> 02:06.842
spine-tingling thriller
full of twists and turns?

02:06.862 --> 02:08.591
If you are, look no further

02:08.610 --> 02:10.850
than my latest novel, "raging heat."

02:10.870 --> 02:13.791
Why don't you download your copy today?
Because wether you get it on the download,

02:13.811 --> 02:16.778
buy a hard copy,
or just listen to the audio version,

02:16.798 --> 02:20.347
I promise you, it'll keep you hooked
till the very last word.

02:24.020 --> 02:25.067
Oops.

02:25.700 --> 02:27.566
That must have been kind of embarrassing.

02:27.586 --> 02:29.551
It was a minor blow to my ego.

02:29.571 --> 02:31.934
But after that,
I had to channel my inner Castle.

02:31.954 --> 02:34.664
But once I did, nailed it.

02:34.684 --> 02:37.480
Wow, you nailed playing yourself.
That's impressive.

02:37.500 --> 02:41.116
Eh, mock if you will,
but pretty soon, you're gonna see my image

02:41.136 --> 02:43.511
splashed across multiple platforms.

02:43.531 --> 02:45.913
It's gonna be Castle 2.0.

02:45.933 --> 02:48.209
It's gonna be Castle in the cloud.

02:48.229 --> 02:49.996
Wait a minute. Multiple platforms?

02:50.016 --> 02:51.944
I thought that this was a TV commercial.

02:51.964 --> 02:54.314
No, better... it's a webmercial.

02:54.334 --> 02:55.493
And once it drops in a few days,

02:55.513 --> 02:57.972
my publisher assures me that both
"raging heat" and I

02:57.992 --> 02:59.261
will go viral.

02:59.281 --> 03:00.936
It's time I let technology wrap me

03:00.956 --> 03:03.033
in its warm yet lucrative embrace.

03:03.053 --> 03:04.907
- Huh.
- Gentlemen.

03:04.927 --> 03:07.946
Is there an elevator? Is this a walk-up?
Hope it's an elevator.

03:09.883 --> 03:12.449
Esposito: Victim's name is Abby Smith.
She's 23 years old.

03:12.469 --> 03:14.668
A maintenance worker found her
early this morning.

03:14.688 --> 03:16.467
We're dealing
with something messed up here.

03:16.487 --> 03:20.224
You got that right, starting off
with these stab wounds.

03:20.894 --> 03:24.222
They're round.
What was the murder weapon?

03:24.242 --> 03:25.598
Lanie: Hard to tell.

03:25.666 --> 03:27.900
A knitting needle, maybe,
or an ice pick.

03:27.968 --> 03:30.276
Your guess is as good as mine.

03:30.679 --> 03:32.916
Her attacker knew about anatomy.

03:32.936 --> 03:35.863
He pierced her carotid
and her subclavian arteries.

03:35.883 --> 03:37.735
- She bled out in minutes.
- Which means our killer

03:37.755 --> 03:40.280
might have had
a medical background.

03:40.347 --> 03:43.015
You know, there are no signs
of forced entry.

03:43.083 --> 03:44.897
Do we know
how this killer came in?

03:44.917 --> 03:46.091
Well, we're not really sure.

03:46.111 --> 03:49.555
But he definitely wanted Abby
to know that he was here.

03:49.623 --> 03:51.157
She was texted this photo
at 10:33,

03:51.224 --> 03:53.025
right around time of death.

03:53.816 --> 03:55.750
Beckett: The killer sent this?

03:55.770 --> 03:57.196
Right before he murdered her.

03:57.264 --> 03:58.597
- He was watching her.
- Mm.

03:58.665 --> 04:00.332
And then he sent that
to terrorize her.

04:00.400 --> 04:01.700
This was personal.

04:01.768 --> 04:03.655
Well, so much for
the warm embrace of technology.

04:03.675 --> 04:05.005
Is there any way
to trace the text?

04:05.025 --> 04:06.913
Well, we'll try, but it was sent
from a burner phone.

04:06.933 --> 04:09.308
Um, meanwhile, we'll check with the
neighbors and see if they saw anything.

04:09.375 --> 04:10.876
Okay, and talk
to friends and family.

04:10.944 --> 04:13.554
If this was personal, they might have
an idea as to who was behind this.

04:13.574 --> 04:15.897
Why don't we start with this guy? Carlos.

04:15.917 --> 04:18.317
She was on the phone with him
right before she received the text message.

04:18.384 --> 04:21.427
Judging by their call history,
he looks to be the boyfriend.

04:22.084 --> 04:23.888
Carlos: I can't believe
this happened.

04:23.908 --> 04:25.590
I should've been there
to protect her.

04:26.492 --> 04:27.936
We have to ask you, Carlos,

04:27.956 --> 04:29.723
who else had a key
to Abby's place?

04:29.743 --> 04:30.995
Nobody.

04:31.063 --> 04:32.330
Just the landlord.

04:32.397 --> 04:34.843
You know if
she was expecting any visitors?

04:35.030 --> 04:36.126
No.

04:36.146 --> 04:38.919
She was actually heading out
to club Doom.

04:38.939 --> 04:40.671
She had booked a personal appearance there.

04:40.739 --> 04:42.707
Uh... Abby was a celebrity?

04:42.774 --> 04:44.575
She was huge on social media.

04:44.643 --> 04:46.744
So, was she an actress
or a singer or what?

04:46.812 --> 04:48.852
No. She posted pics
on Snappamatic...

04:48.872 --> 04:50.254
you know, the photo-sharing app.

04:50.274 --> 04:52.153
"Snappamatic Reviews,"
she called them.

04:52.173 --> 04:53.917
And that got her
personal appearances?

04:53.985 --> 04:55.285
Yeah, and sponsors, too,

04:55.354 --> 04:57.321
especially when she hit
half a million followers.

04:57.389 --> 04:59.133
What did Abby review, exactly?

04:59.153 --> 05:01.106
They were, like, joke reviews.

05:01.126 --> 05:03.844
She came to New York
to be a comedian,

05:03.968 --> 05:07.580
and, um, this...
is how she hit it big.

05:08.066 --> 05:09.499
"These gyros came right back up.

05:09.567 --> 05:11.335
That's a two-for-one special
you don't want."

05:11.402 --> 05:13.570
This pic went viral and...

05:13.637 --> 05:15.605
overnight, she was a star,

05:16.069 --> 05:18.842
with followers and fans,
all this attention.

05:18.909 --> 05:20.510
I-I felt like I was losing her.

05:20.578 --> 05:22.779
Like there was no room left
for the two of us.

05:22.847 --> 05:24.814
Do you think
she had any stalkers?

05:24.834 --> 05:27.650
If she did, I'm not sure
she would have told me.

05:27.670 --> 05:31.945
Did any of these reviewees
get upset about the pictures she posted?

05:32.751 --> 05:33.923
Actually, yeah.

05:33.991 --> 05:35.624
There was a guy...
he made threatening calls.

05:35.692 --> 05:36.926
What was his name?

05:36.994 --> 05:38.060
Esposito: Edward Han.

05:38.128 --> 05:39.362
He's an acupuncturist.

05:39.429 --> 05:41.364
His cellphone records show
that he called Abby

05:41.431 --> 05:43.465
a dozen times
in the days before her murder.

05:43.533 --> 05:45.201
And who better
than an acupuncturist

05:45.269 --> 05:48.570
to kill with accurate punctures,
perhaps with a giant needle?

05:48.638 --> 05:50.106
Beckett: And he has
the anatomical training

05:50.173 --> 05:51.239
to know where to strike.

05:51.307 --> 05:53.609
Not to mention beef with Abby.
Check this out.

05:53.676 --> 05:55.677
This was posted
all over the place,

05:55.745 --> 05:57.960
and I bet it put a damper
on Han's practice.

05:57.980 --> 06:00.708
- "Do not let this guy poke you."
- I don't get it.

06:00.728 --> 06:02.551
Posting dumb-ass photos
all over the place...

06:02.619 --> 06:04.115
how did she have a fan base?

06:04.135 --> 06:05.654
How did this become a career?

06:05.674 --> 06:07.209
Welcome to the sharing economy.

06:07.229 --> 06:09.008
- Yeah, more like over-sharing.
- Really?

06:09.028 --> 06:12.073
And you're opposed to all
photos of over-sharing women?

06:12.669 --> 06:14.170
That's different.

06:14.406 --> 06:15.397
Ryan: Hey.

06:15.464 --> 06:16.998
Han's starting to look good
for this.

06:17.066 --> 06:19.478
One of Abby's neighbors saw him
at her apartment yesterday.

06:19.498 --> 06:21.024
At her apartment?
Doing what?

06:21.044 --> 06:23.635
Screaming at her,
threatening to "make her pay"

06:23.655 --> 06:25.236
till she slammed the door
in his face.

06:25.256 --> 06:27.608
So maybe he went back
to get the last word.

06:27.676 --> 06:28.876
I never went back.

06:28.944 --> 06:30.878
I admit, I was at her apartment

06:30.946 --> 06:32.814
and I may have said
those things.

06:32.881 --> 06:35.085
You were angry
about this review.

06:35.105 --> 06:36.400
Review?

06:36.420 --> 06:38.448
That bimbo
was never even a client.

06:38.468 --> 06:41.279
She posted that picture,
and my walk-ins dropped off.

06:41.299 --> 06:43.424
Her little joke was costing me my business.

06:43.491 --> 06:45.858
Yeah, well, in our business,
we call that motive.

06:45.878 --> 06:47.828
Where were you last night
at 10:30?

06:47.895 --> 06:49.729
Off drowning my sorrows.

06:49.797 --> 06:52.632
I swear to you,
I did not do this.

06:53.125 --> 06:54.557
But I know who did.

06:54.577 --> 06:55.502
She had a stalker.

06:55.570 --> 06:57.671
Yeah, I know.
We're looking at him.

06:57.691 --> 07:00.239
Not me. That's what Abby thought,
too... that I was stalking her.

07:00.307 --> 07:01.508
Now, why would she think that?

07:01.576 --> 07:03.276
Maybe because you were
calling her all the time,

07:03.344 --> 07:04.309
showing up at her place?

07:04.329 --> 07:07.581
Abby said someone had been following her
for the last month,

07:07.601 --> 07:09.282
but I didn't track her down
till a week ago.

07:09.350 --> 07:10.984
So the stalker
couldn't have been me.

07:11.051 --> 07:12.619
Mr. Han, do you have evidence

07:12.687 --> 07:15.058
that this other person
actually exists?

07:17.317 --> 07:19.558
There's a note on a postcard.

07:19.626 --> 07:20.926
- What note?
- A threat.

07:20.995 --> 07:21.927
She got it that day.

07:21.996 --> 07:23.262
She waved it in my face.

07:23.330 --> 07:25.671
She accused me
of slipping it under her door.

07:25.691 --> 07:27.922
Who ever left that note thats who did this.

07:27.942 --> 07:29.382
It has to be.

07:33.378 --> 07:34.573
Han's alibi checks out.

07:34.641 --> 07:36.876
Bartender said he was
well into his fourth Mai Tai

07:36.943 --> 07:38.343
at the time of the murder.

07:38.411 --> 07:40.178
Upon reflection,
it's just as well

07:40.246 --> 07:41.847
from a storytelling standpoint.

07:41.915 --> 07:43.949
I mean,
"do not let this guy poke you,"

07:44.017 --> 07:46.351
then the acupuncturist
stabs her with a giant needle.

07:46.419 --> 07:47.919
It's just a little too obvious.

07:47.987 --> 07:50.389
Which means we're looking
for someone else with motive,

07:50.456 --> 07:52.357
but so far, no one sticks out.

07:52.425 --> 07:54.100
Maybe Abby's family
has some insight.

07:54.120 --> 07:56.942
They don't.
She wasn't very close to them.

07:57.116 --> 07:59.652
Looks like Han was telling
the truth about that threat.

07:59.672 --> 08:02.675
C.S.U. found this postcard
in Abby's dresser drawer.

08:05.008 --> 08:07.221
Beckett: "The brightest stars
burn quickest."

08:07.241 --> 08:10.000
She got this on the same day
she was murdered?

08:10.020 --> 08:11.919
Wait, is this a fingerprint?

08:12.080 --> 08:14.865
No. That's a smudge,
but it might mean something.

08:14.885 --> 08:16.599
The lab says
that it's wood varnish.

08:16.619 --> 08:18.915
Hey, guys. Check this out.

08:22.079 --> 08:23.965
I was looking
through Abby's followers,

08:23.985 --> 08:27.440
and one of them posted pictures
of her on their account.

08:30.592 --> 08:31.529
Crime-scene photos?

08:31.596 --> 08:33.102
But not ours.

08:33.123 --> 08:34.498
The killer took these photos

08:34.566 --> 08:36.386
before we got
to the crime scene.

08:36.407 --> 08:38.168
"This star's 15 seconds
are over."

08:38.235 --> 08:42.017
- Whose account is this?
- Username is "Netslayer."

08:46.919 --> 08:49.300

08:55.441 --> 08:57.799
He kills her,
then posts her picture.

08:57.960 --> 08:58.776
Why would he do that?

08:58.844 --> 09:01.346
Well, tear down the victim,
add insult to injury.

09:01.414 --> 09:03.648
"This star's 15 seconds
are over."

09:03.716 --> 09:06.385
Maybe that's why he killed Abby,
because she was a web celebrity.

09:06.405 --> 09:08.152
Ryan: Or he wants
to become one himself.

09:08.220 --> 09:10.336
Abby did have half a million followers.

09:10.356 --> 09:12.056
Killing her would give him
instant high profile.

09:12.124 --> 09:13.658
Beckett: Or he could just
be using social media

09:13.726 --> 09:15.515
to hide his true motives
for killing her.

09:15.535 --> 09:18.159
Beckett: Either way, maybe these
photos could help us find him.

09:18.179 --> 09:20.031
Yeah, I'll get with Tory.
We'll analyze the photos,

09:20.099 --> 09:21.599
see if we can pull some
images off the reflections.

09:21.667 --> 09:23.267
And I'll go through his account,

09:23.287 --> 09:26.412
see if he posted anything else
that could help us I.D. him.

09:26.432 --> 09:28.170
Where you guys going?
Straight to the source...

09:28.190 --> 09:32.109
maybe Snappamatic can give us an idea
who he is or where to find him.

09:34.912 --> 09:36.890
Actually, I.D.'ing and locating users

09:36.910 --> 09:38.404
are two things we just can't do.

09:38.424 --> 09:40.605
Can't or won't?

09:40.625 --> 09:41.238
Oren: Can't.

09:41.258 --> 09:43.553
Snappamatic was designed
for privacy.

09:43.621 --> 09:46.817
It runs on a software platform
that anonymizes all of our users.

09:46.837 --> 09:49.219
I bet that was a real
selling point for the killer.

09:49.239 --> 09:53.041
Look, no one is more upset
about this than we are.

09:53.061 --> 09:54.898
I bet Abby Smith was.

09:55.858 --> 09:57.500
One of your users killed her,

09:57.568 --> 09:59.202
and you're trying to tell me
that you can't help us.

09:59.270 --> 10:01.371
We're trying. Evan's combing
the guy's account,

10:01.438 --> 10:04.040
but all you need to register
is a valid e-mail address.

10:04.107 --> 10:06.676
Which isn't valid anymore,
by the way, so no help there.

10:06.696 --> 10:09.416
What we can do is suspend
his account so he can't post.

10:09.436 --> 10:11.747
Uh, well, the reason he's
posting in the first place

10:11.815 --> 10:12.848
is because he wants attention.

10:12.916 --> 10:14.784
- He needs to communicate.
- Exactly.

10:14.851 --> 10:16.285
He likes to share, so let him.

10:16.352 --> 10:18.754
Maybe he's gonna share something
that he didn't intend to.

10:18.822 --> 10:22.090
Now, take the pictures down
but leave the account up.

10:22.110 --> 10:24.193
W-we'd rather not
have the Snappamatic brand

10:24.260 --> 10:25.795
associated with a murderer.

10:25.862 --> 10:27.396
It already is.

10:27.416 --> 10:29.198
It's our pipeline
directly to the killer.

10:29.265 --> 10:31.017
The account stays open.

10:31.037 --> 10:32.742
Consider the bright side, gentlemen...

10:32.762 --> 10:34.984
the traffic for your site
will be through the roof.

10:36.163 --> 10:38.173
I think I got something.

10:40.274 --> 10:42.143
I was digging
through the metadata

10:42.212 --> 10:44.546
and found a geotag anomaly
on one of the pictures.

10:44.614 --> 10:45.914
What kind of an anomaly?

10:45.981 --> 10:48.016
Okay, so, the geotag
holds GPS coordinates,

10:48.084 --> 10:50.051
usually of
where a photo was taken.

10:50.119 --> 10:51.452
Usually but not always?

10:51.520 --> 10:53.688
Not if the camera
loses its GPS signal.

10:53.756 --> 10:54.956
In that case,

10:55.024 --> 10:56.991
a geotag is assigned
when the photo is uploaded.

10:57.059 --> 10:59.493
So, the killer lost his
GPS signal, didn't notice...

10:59.561 --> 11:02.063
And then when he posted
his photos onto Snappamatic,

11:02.131 --> 11:03.731
he accidentally
revealed his location.

11:03.798 --> 11:05.600
Wh-what are the coordinates?

11:05.667 --> 11:08.101
Esposito: Tory plotted the longitude
and latitude of the geotag,

11:08.121 --> 11:09.999
and we got an address
in downtown Manhattan.

11:10.019 --> 11:10.971
And what's there?

11:11.039 --> 11:12.806
It's a vintage furniture store.

11:12.874 --> 11:14.108
W-w-wood... wood...
wood varnish.

11:14.175 --> 11:15.509
That explains
the smudge on the note.

11:15.577 --> 11:17.612
Okay, let's get the names
of everyone that works there.

11:17.679 --> 11:18.979
We already did.

11:19.047 --> 11:21.148
It's a one-man shop
owned by one Bill Garrett.

11:21.216 --> 11:23.717
Turns out he used to be a cop
until he had a nervous breakdown.

11:23.785 --> 11:26.628
And get this...
he worked in the cyber division.

11:26.648 --> 11:29.855
Which means he would know
his way around the web and social media.

11:29.875 --> 11:31.344
Bring him in.

11:31.364 --> 11:33.560
[Siren wails]

11:33.786 --> 11:35.796
Bill Garrett. NYPD.

11:35.864 --> 11:37.130
Keep your hands
where we can see them.

11:37.197 --> 11:39.681
On your knees.
You know the drill.

11:49.782 --> 11:53.170
Getting brought in here
is no way to treat a fellow officer.

11:53.190 --> 11:56.342
Mr. Garrett, we found these
when we searched your shop.

11:58.019 --> 12:00.419
I re-finish furniture.
Of course I have awls.

12:00.439 --> 12:03.405
Awls that match the stab wounds
in her neck?

12:04.919 --> 12:07.860
[Scoffs] If you think I murdered this girl,
you're out of your mind.

12:07.928 --> 12:09.728
We also found this cellphone.

12:09.796 --> 12:10.962
Keep it for emergencies.

12:11.030 --> 12:12.197
Emergencies?

12:12.265 --> 12:14.390
Like, uh, snapping photos?

12:17.381 --> 12:20.105
You see, even when you delete them,

12:20.173 --> 12:22.174
they can still be recovered.

12:22.241 --> 12:23.975
All right, what is this?
I didn't take those.

12:24.043 --> 12:26.222
Then how did they end up
on your phone?

12:26.242 --> 12:28.914
And why were they uploaded
to Snappamatic

12:28.981 --> 12:30.048
using your wifi network?

12:30.116 --> 12:31.349
I don't upload photos.

12:31.417 --> 12:33.384
I don't even go near the web
unless I have to.

12:33.452 --> 12:34.652
And then
there's the text to Abby

12:34.720 --> 12:36.587
and the wood varnish
on this note,

12:36.655 --> 12:39.124
which we're gonna trace
right back to your shop.

12:39.192 --> 12:40.714
It's over.

12:41.136 --> 12:43.494
Your best bet is to cut a deal.

12:43.990 --> 12:46.096
This is a mistake.

12:48.210 --> 12:50.835
Working cyber unit
must have taken its toll.

12:50.902 --> 12:53.070
It had to have been difficult.

12:53.138 --> 12:54.439
Seeing the darkest side
of the web...

12:54.506 --> 12:56.416
that must have changed you.

12:56.689 --> 12:58.965
Maybe that's why you left
and did what you did.

12:58.985 --> 13:00.379
I didn't do anything.

13:00.399 --> 13:03.013
And I quit cyber because
a frat boy date-raped a girl,

13:03.081 --> 13:04.548
posted the photos online,
and got away with it,

13:04.615 --> 13:07.832
so I flipped out
and I put him in the hospital.

13:08.229 --> 13:10.034
I did not hurt this girl.

13:10.054 --> 13:11.621
I do not know her.

13:11.689 --> 13:13.257
Where were you at 10:30 p.m.?

13:13.325 --> 13:15.226
- I was at home.
- With who?

13:16.209 --> 13:17.726
Nobody.

13:17.925 --> 13:19.696
I was alone.

13:20.531 --> 13:22.065
[Cellphone buzzes]

13:31.441 --> 13:34.310
This was just posted
to the Netslayer's account.

13:37.456 --> 13:39.851
That's you guys
arresting Garrett.

13:41.241 --> 13:42.928
Wait, what's this?

13:43.187 --> 13:44.754
"Wrong suspect, NYPD.

13:44.821 --> 13:46.389
"I'm still here.

13:46.912 --> 13:48.457
What will I do next?"

13:48.477 --> 13:49.859
So, either Garrett was framed...

13:49.926 --> 13:53.044
Or somehow, he pulled this off
to make it look like he was framed.

13:53.064 --> 13:56.164
Whoever this is, he just
took this to a whole new level.

13:56.232 --> 13:58.171
He's taunting us.
[Computer chimes]

13:58.191 --> 14:00.082

[Computer chiming]

14:09.747 --> 14:12.281
Body parts, sausages, a date.

14:13.341 --> 14:15.650
"The game is on."
That's a challenge. Those are clues.

14:15.718 --> 14:17.459
Clues to what?

14:17.479 --> 14:19.539
His next murder.

14:26.004 --> 14:30.463
Body parts, sausage, November 12th.

14:30.483 --> 14:34.577
Body parts
being made into sausage.

14:34.597 --> 14:38.635
Human sausages in November.

14:38.655 --> 14:40.385
I am not getting anywhere
with this.

14:40.405 --> 14:43.853
And you're sure? Okay. Thanks.

14:44.273 --> 14:45.941
Garrett's alibi checks out.

14:45.961 --> 14:48.658
He activated his alarm system
when he got home last night,

14:48.725 --> 14:51.662
and no one entered
or exited until morning.

14:51.682 --> 14:54.461
So the killer set him up
just to toy with us.

14:54.481 --> 14:57.967
Detective, the news media's
calling for comment.

14:58.035 --> 15:00.132
1PP wants to know
what we think this is.

15:00.152 --> 15:01.138
We're not sure.

15:01.158 --> 15:04.306
This could be a clue as to
his next victim or victims.

15:04.374 --> 15:06.497
Each image could represent
a different person.

15:06.517 --> 15:09.860
Or it could be a pictogram,
where the images add up to a message.

15:09.880 --> 15:12.781
Tory's trying to analyze
each image, find their sources.

15:12.801 --> 15:14.683
But we think that this collage

15:14.750 --> 15:17.822
is from one photo of a woman,
Caucasian, in her 20s.

15:17.842 --> 15:19.621
So she could be our next target.

15:19.689 --> 15:21.022
And given the killer's behavior,

15:21.090 --> 15:22.891
she's most likely someone
with a high Internet profile,

15:22.958 --> 15:24.459
like Abby Smith.

15:24.527 --> 15:25.594
Yo.

15:25.662 --> 15:27.634
So, we I.D.'d that grill as a Fowler.

15:27.654 --> 15:29.164
We're checking
into anybody named Fowler

15:29.231 --> 15:30.732
who might be big
on social media.

15:30.800 --> 15:34.767
And that date, November 12th...
any special significance?

15:34.787 --> 15:37.961
Well, for starters, it turns out
it is world pneumonia day.

15:37.981 --> 15:40.075
But we're also
checking into any news events,

15:40.142 --> 15:42.026
births, deaths that occurred on that day.

15:42.046 --> 15:43.877
Castle: If it even is a date.

15:43.945 --> 15:45.940
11, 12, 13 could be
part of a number sequence.

Yes, Castle, we're also
looking into that,

15:47.714 --> 15:50.184

put away while he was in cyber.

15:59.494 --> 16:00.761
[Computer beeps]

16:00.781 --> 16:02.596
It was cropped from this photo
of a food blogger

named Mary Fuchs.

16:04.432 --> 16:05.833
Where did you find that photo?

16:05.900 --> 16:08.836
She posted it on her
Snappamatic feed a few days ago.

16:08.903 --> 16:12.339
So Mary Fuchs is a Snappamatic
user, just like Abby Smith.

16:12.406 --> 16:13.640
She could be next.

and bring her in here.

16:15.634 --> 16:16.909
I don't understand.

16:16.977 --> 16:19.205
Why would someone
post part of my picture?

16:19.225 --> 16:22.324
Ms. Fuchs, do these images
mean anything to you?

Do you know her?

16:30.658 --> 16:33.192
Do you have
any connection to her?

I-I'd never even heard of her

- Uh, german cuisine.
- German cuisine?

16:51.270 --> 16:54.813
I'm german,
so I review german restaurants,

16:54.833 --> 16:58.584

I'm grilling in the picture.

17:21.624 --> 17:23.900

a message that no one's safe,

not web celebs
or obscure german-food bloggers.

17:30.316 --> 17:32.176
Well, you better add artists
to that list, as well.

17:32.196 --> 17:33.551

17:33.619 --> 17:35.052
Is it from Snappamatic?

17:35.120 --> 17:37.988
Yeah, from the feed of a painter
named Daniel Leek.

17:38.008 --> 17:40.691
The image is from a photo
he took of one of his pieces.

17:42.861 --> 17:45.473
is cropped from the top
of this milk carton.

17:45.493 --> 17:48.732
But Leek's pretty low
on the Snappamatic totem pole.

17:48.800 --> 17:50.667
He only has
about 2,000 followers.

17:50.735 --> 17:52.577
Heck, my blog has more than that.

let's try to get him in.

18:09.320 --> 18:10.587
He doesn't live in New York.

18:10.655 --> 18:12.388
If he's in Seattle,
how is he a possible victim?

18:12.456 --> 18:14.261
He's not.

18:14.471 --> 18:16.860
Rotten fruit, expiration date.
What's the name of that painting?

18:16.927 --> 18:19.369
Uh, "Spoiled," I think.

18:20.002 --> 18:22.078
I know what the clues mean.

18:25.267 --> 18:29.338
Expiration date
on spoiled milk plus...

18:30.318 --> 18:36.479
grilled bratwurst equals spoiled brats.

18:37.160 --> 18:38.981
That's the message.
You getting it?

18:39.048 --> 18:42.000
That's what the images mean,
leading us to...?

18:42.335 --> 18:43.666
Seriously?

18:43.686 --> 18:47.041
Anyone here besides me
a consumer of vapid online magazines?

18:47.061 --> 18:48.542
All: No.

18:48.562 --> 18:51.459
Okay. Spoiled brats,

18:51.479 --> 18:53.195
as in "the spoiled brats
of Snappamatic."

18:53.263 --> 18:55.030
Feature article
from two weeks ago.

18:55.098 --> 18:57.465
It's all about rich kids
who post pictures

18:57.533 --> 19:00.102
of their extravagant lifestyles
on Snappamatic.

19:00.122 --> 19:02.437
That's the key
to solving the case.

19:02.457 --> 19:05.039
The killer has given us
a pictogram, as I predicted,

19:05.107 --> 19:06.723
pointing us to that article.

19:06.743 --> 19:08.743
Yeah, maybe,
but what about the third image?

19:08.811 --> 19:10.632
- The collage?
- This is it.

19:10.855 --> 19:12.046
This is the photo.

19:12.114 --> 19:15.450
Those are Tatiana Fisher's body parts
from this photo that she took

19:15.518 --> 19:17.419
with her boyfriend, cam magani.

19:17.486 --> 19:19.686
He posted it
on his Snappamatic feed.

19:19.754 --> 19:22.823
Spoiled brat Tatiana.

19:22.891 --> 19:24.732
She has
over a million followers.

19:24.752 --> 19:28.329
Going after her would raise the
killer's infamy to new heights.

19:28.397 --> 19:30.270
She's the next victim.

19:32.700 --> 19:33.801
[Sirens wailing]

19:33.868 --> 19:35.869
[Tires screech]

19:40.007 --> 19:41.407
Tatiana Fisher.

19:41.928 --> 19:43.176
NYPD.

19:43.244 --> 19:45.482
We've been trying to get ahold
of you and Cam Magani.

19:45.502 --> 19:46.447
We have reason to believe

19:46.514 --> 19:48.878
that you might be
the Netslayer's next target.

19:48.898 --> 19:50.847
That's insane. He wouldn't dare.

19:50.867 --> 19:53.668
W-well, maybe not, but we need to
take you back to the precinct.

19:53.688 --> 19:56.208
I'm not going anywhere with you.
I have a party on Fire Island, so...

19:56.228 --> 19:58.258
Ma'am, this is a potentially
dangerous situation.

19:58.326 --> 20:00.213
Did you just call me "ma'am"?

20:00.233 --> 20:02.395
Look, I'll make it simple
for you, okay?

20:02.415 --> 20:04.836
Can you force me to go with you, yes or no?

20:05.817 --> 20:06.766
No.

20:06.834 --> 20:08.868
Well, then. Bye-bye.

20:09.404 --> 20:11.017
Wait, Miss Fisher.

20:11.576 --> 20:14.224
Miss Fisher,
please, just give us...

20:14.244 --> 20:15.908
Aah!

20:15.976 --> 20:17.830
Oh, my God, Cam!

20:22.225 --> 20:23.725
Female reporter:
The Internet is abuzz today

20:23.792 --> 20:26.452
with news of a serial killer
stalking social media.

20:26.472 --> 20:28.109
Male reporter:
Representatives of Snappamatic,

20:28.129 --> 20:30.375
the online photo-sharing app,
have released a statement

20:30.395 --> 20:32.683
saying that they are
cooperating with authorities.

20:32.703 --> 20:35.326
Socialite Cam Magani's body
was found murdered

20:35.346 --> 20:37.233
in the vehicle
you see behind me.

20:37.253 --> 20:40.570
Magani may be the latest victim
of Netslayer,

20:40.590 --> 20:42.444
the mysterious online figure

20:42.464 --> 20:46.155
who claimed responsibility
for the murder of Abby Smith,

20:46.175 --> 20:49.394
then posted gruesome images
of her body.

20:49.414 --> 20:51.984
With the city
and internet roiling with fear,

20:52.004 --> 20:55.988
many are asking, "who will
this serial killer strike next,

20:56.056 --> 20:59.243
and when
will authorities stop him?"

21:00.297 --> 21:03.801
This guy is getting exactly
what he wanted... attention.

21:03.821 --> 21:05.228
And it's making him bolder.

21:05.248 --> 21:06.666
So where do we stand?

21:06.733 --> 21:08.988
Sir, it looks like the killer hid
in the backseat of Cam's car,

21:09.008 --> 21:11.367
waited for him to get in,
and then slit his throat.

21:11.387 --> 21:12.885
How did he get in the car?

21:12.905 --> 21:14.373
Well, we're not sure,

21:14.440 --> 21:16.604
but C.S.U. found plastic
fragments inside the door lock.

21:16.624 --> 21:17.676
Might be from a lock pick.

21:17.744 --> 21:19.144
Esposito: So far,
there's no prints or DNA,

21:19.211 --> 21:21.680
and all we know for sure is that
the killer was right-handed.

21:21.748 --> 21:23.891
And we paid too high a cost
for that knowledge.

21:23.911 --> 21:26.318
Detective,
bring me some good news

21:26.386 --> 21:28.028
before we lose another one.

21:28.048 --> 21:29.821
Yes, sir.

21:31.250 --> 21:33.324
Can't help but think if only
I'd figured it out sooner,

21:33.392 --> 21:34.558
maybe he'd still be alive.

21:34.626 --> 21:36.060
It wouldn't have mattered.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.328
The game was rigged
from the start.

21:37.396 --> 21:38.729
We never had a chance.

21:38.798 --> 21:40.540
The killer just wanted us to think we did.

21:40.560 --> 21:42.100
And now the Netslayer
is gonna gain more notoriety

21:42.168 --> 21:44.078
and more followers.

21:44.098 --> 21:45.575
He already has.

21:45.711 --> 21:47.204
He's at over half a million so far,

21:47.224 --> 21:49.583
adding thousands more
by the minute.

21:50.241 --> 21:52.376
Detective Beckett,
two more pictures just came in.

21:52.444 --> 21:55.097
Something different this time.

21:56.140 --> 21:57.634
This one was uploaded first.

21:57.654 --> 21:59.763
Proof of death,
I guess you'd call it.

21:59.950 --> 22:02.134
Then he sent this one.

22:03.994 --> 22:07.159
Beckett: Castle, it's us
before the first crime scene.

22:08.735 --> 22:10.675
Castle: "NYPD is on the case.

22:10.695 --> 22:13.330
"Feel safe, New York?
You shouldn't.

22:13.450 --> 22:14.979
I'm not done."

22:14.999 --> 22:17.334
He's been watching us
from the beginning.

22:17.401 --> 22:20.128
This guy has been ahead of us
the whole time.

22:20.148 --> 22:22.879
Detective Beckett, a word?

22:28.505 --> 22:31.614
1PP saw that picture, too,
and they called me,

22:31.682 --> 22:34.183
concerned about your commitment
to this case.

22:34.251 --> 22:36.285
Sir, they're taking that photo
out of context.

22:36.353 --> 22:37.820
The truth doesn't matter, Kate.

22:37.888 --> 22:40.319
It's a public-relations problem now.

22:40.339 --> 22:43.731
The killer just turned you into the poster
child for these murders not being solved.

22:43.751 --> 22:44.798
So... What?

22:44.818 --> 22:45.962
They want to take me off the case?

22:46.029 --> 22:47.952
I told them no.

22:48.101 --> 22:50.866
I won't let our suspect
sabotage this investigation

22:50.933 --> 22:53.102
by manipulating the narrative.

22:53.238 --> 22:56.975
So, go home, clear your head.

22:56.995 --> 23:00.556
You get back here
and you take his ass down.

23:07.250 --> 23:08.850
This is why I hate social media.

23:08.918 --> 23:11.862
Once something is out there,
you have no control.

23:11.882 --> 23:14.322
People can take a private moment
and create their own context.

23:14.390 --> 23:16.457
I mean, we weren't even
investigating the murder yet,

23:16.525 --> 23:18.690
and they made us look like
we were bad cops.

23:18.710 --> 23:21.731
- Or worse, like we didn't care.
- Come on, Beckett.

23:21.751 --> 23:22.785
It's the Internet.

23:22.805 --> 23:24.622
No one's gonna take
that picture seriously.

23:24.642 --> 23:25.900
1PP did.

23:25.967 --> 23:27.869
Look, it's gonna blow over, okay?

23:27.936 --> 23:30.471
With millions of items
being posted every minute,

23:30.539 --> 23:33.799
this is but a blip
on the net continuum.

23:35.003 --> 23:36.274
[Inhales sharply]

23:36.294 --> 23:37.845
You know the problem
with anonymity?

23:37.913 --> 23:39.680
There is no accountability.

23:39.748 --> 23:42.506
It empowers cowards
to become bullies,

23:42.526 --> 23:44.164
just like this guy.

23:45.666 --> 23:46.993
You know what?

23:48.197 --> 23:50.690
Most bullies started out
as victims themselves.

23:50.758 --> 23:52.359
Maybe this guy's
lashing out on the Internet

23:52.427 --> 23:54.309
because it was used against him.

23:54.682 --> 23:55.996
He was a victim of cyber crime.

23:56.064 --> 23:58.131
And Bill Garrett was a cyber cop.

23:58.198 --> 24:00.756
It can't be a coincidence
that the killer targeted him.

24:00.776 --> 24:02.636
We've been looking at people
Garrett put away...

24:02.703 --> 24:05.439
When we should have been looking
at victims of his cyber cases.

24:05.506 --> 24:06.640
Okay, I'll get ahold of Garrett.

24:06.707 --> 24:08.636
I'll have him
look into his old case files.

24:08.656 --> 24:10.009
Our killer's got to be
in there somewhere.

24:10.077 --> 24:14.547
Still, how did he get into Garrett's shop
to plant the evidence, or cam's car?

24:14.614 --> 24:17.354
Ryan: I'll tell you how...
with a key.

24:17.374 --> 24:19.129
A key that he made.

24:19.149 --> 24:20.693
- 3-D printer.
- Yeah.

24:20.713 --> 24:24.081
Remember the fragments that we found
in the lock of Cam's Rolls-Royce?

24:24.101 --> 24:25.191
Well, they're P.L.A...

24:25.259 --> 24:28.349
it's a bioplastic used in 3-D printing.

24:28.369 --> 24:31.515
C.S.U. found P.L.A. in the locks
at Abby's apartment,

24:31.535 --> 24:32.898
as well as Garrett's shop.

24:32.918 --> 24:35.619
How could the killer make a copy of the key
without the original?

24:35.639 --> 24:38.237
Turns out, all you need is a picture.

24:38.473 --> 24:41.322
When cam bought the rolls,
he bragged about it

24:41.342 --> 24:45.814
by posting a photo of the key
that anyone could then digitize.

24:45.834 --> 24:48.457
So, just as the killer did,

24:48.477 --> 24:53.051
I uploaded the photo
to the printer and...

24:55.178 --> 24:56.138
voila .

24:56.158 --> 24:57.122
Outstanding.

24:57.387 --> 25:00.295
If by "outstanding" you mean "horrifying."

25:00.315 --> 25:02.627
The killer snapped a photo of this key

25:02.647 --> 25:04.837
and then made a 3-D duplicate of it.

25:04.857 --> 25:06.359
Welcome to the future.

25:06.379 --> 25:08.791
Still, I got to get one of these.

25:10.057 --> 25:12.494
Is there any way of finding out
where the killer got his?

25:12.514 --> 25:14.906
Well, we're checking. But between
brick-and-mortar and online stores,

25:14.974 --> 25:16.958
we got hundreds of vendors.

25:16.978 --> 25:18.843
Well, this explains how he got Cam's key,

25:18.911 --> 25:21.412
but not Garrett and Abby's.

25:21.480 --> 25:23.571
Uh, Abby never
posted photos of her keys.

25:23.591 --> 25:25.929
A-and she was careful. It's not
like she left them lying around.

25:25.949 --> 25:27.418
Did she ever valet park her car?

25:27.438 --> 25:29.714
No, she didn't even drive it
except to get out of the city.

25:29.734 --> 25:31.755
Any of her friends
have keys to her place?

25:31.823 --> 25:34.225
- No.
- She never let anybody crash there?

25:34.292 --> 25:37.793
Actually... Abby used to
rent out her apartment online

25:37.813 --> 25:39.505
through a travel site.

25:39.525 --> 25:41.230
The people who stayed...
how'd they get her keys?

25:41.250 --> 25:44.001
She'd leave them under
a loose brick on her stoop.

25:44.068 --> 25:46.552
So, I've been running the people
that rented Abby's apartment.

25:46.572 --> 25:49.806
Why would anyone let complete
strangers stay in their place?

25:49.826 --> 25:51.548
Extra money.

25:51.796 --> 25:55.145
After this, I don't think
I'll be doing it anymore.

25:55.455 --> 25:56.946
So, all the renters checked out,

25:56.966 --> 26:00.022
except for one guy
who booked and never showed up.

26:00.042 --> 26:02.566
This is from an A.T.M.
across from Abby's apartment

26:02.586 --> 26:04.387
on the day he was supposed to stay there.

26:04.455 --> 26:06.820
Turns out a guy did show up.
Check this out.

26:06.840 --> 26:08.791
[Computer beeping]

26:13.964 --> 26:15.845
He took a picture of her key.

26:15.865 --> 26:17.905
It's the Netslayer. It's got to be.

26:17.925 --> 26:20.002
It's too far away
and too low-res to blow up,

26:20.022 --> 26:22.231
but watch this as he walks away.

26:23.435 --> 26:24.750
There.

26:27.446 --> 26:29.518
And now we have a face.

26:34.880 --> 26:37.786
Okay. Where are we
on finding this man?

26:37.806 --> 26:38.965
We're distributing his picture.

26:38.985 --> 26:41.766
So far, none of the victims' families
or neighbors recognize him.

26:41.786 --> 26:44.613
Sir, I'd like to release his photo
to the press and social media.

26:44.633 --> 26:46.664
Let's turn the tables
on this guy.

26:46.684 --> 26:50.262
He's trying to hide it, but someone
out there's gonna recognize his face.

26:50.282 --> 26:53.091
You're right,
and that someone is me.

26:54.132 --> 26:57.409
I was going over his case files
when the officer showed me his photo.

26:57.429 --> 26:58.348
Who is he?

26:58.368 --> 27:00.436
His name's Adam Lane.

27:00.456 --> 27:01.501
Gates: You arrested him?

27:01.521 --> 27:04.045
He wasn't a criminal
when we met. He was a victim.

27:04.616 --> 27:06.509
And do you have any idea
where he is now?

27:06.577 --> 27:08.554
I haven't seen or heard
from lane in six years.

27:08.574 --> 27:10.146
Took me a minute
to recognize him

27:10.213 --> 27:12.181
with that fake beard
he's wearing.

27:12.249 --> 27:13.416
Okay.

27:13.484 --> 27:17.093
I'll get ready to release Adam Lane's name
and picture to the media.

27:17.217 --> 27:19.525
- There's no current address for Lane.
- Try to find one.

27:19.545 --> 27:21.511
Reach out to his family
and anyone else that knows him.

27:21.531 --> 27:24.882
In the meantime, you need to tell us
everything you know about Adam Lane.

27:28.245 --> 27:30.330
Lane was in high school back then.

27:30.350 --> 27:31.787
It was a cyber-bullying case.

27:31.807 --> 27:33.180
Who was bullying him?

27:33.200 --> 27:35.537
He was taking a shower when
this meathead football player,

27:35.605 --> 27:37.506
Tim Witherspoon, stole his clothes.

27:37.573 --> 27:39.675
Now, this has happened to Lane
his whole life,

27:39.695 --> 27:41.425
but this time, he went ballistic.

27:41.445 --> 27:44.078
There he was, buck naked, screaming
at Witherspoon in a locker room.

27:44.098 --> 27:45.820
I think I know
where the cyber part comes in.

27:45.840 --> 27:47.607
Yeah, Witherspoon secretly recorded it

27:47.627 --> 27:49.518
and posted it on his MySpace page.

27:49.538 --> 27:51.286
[Sighs] So he was publicly humiliated.

27:51.354 --> 27:53.188
Yeah, but it wasn't just humiliation.

27:53.255 --> 27:55.256
After the video, the kids turned on him.

27:55.325 --> 27:58.923
They inundated him with
these awful, hateful e-mails,

27:58.943 --> 28:00.995
and no one was held accountable.

28:01.063 --> 28:02.095
Why not?

28:02.115 --> 28:03.998
The cyber-bullying laws
at the time were weak.

28:04.066 --> 28:05.399
I got them
to take the video down,

28:05.467 --> 28:08.569
but I couldn't convince the D.A.
to press charges.

28:08.845 --> 28:10.756
I should've tried harder.

28:11.066 --> 28:12.399
What happened to Lane?

28:12.419 --> 28:14.088
Everyone has their breaking point, right?

28:14.108 --> 28:16.273
Quit school, withdrew from life.

28:16.293 --> 28:17.564
It ruined him.

28:17.584 --> 28:18.679
Castle: And now he's getting revenge

28:18.747 --> 28:21.014
by going after the popular kids
on social media.

28:21.082 --> 28:22.982
And targeting me
because I didn't protect him.

28:23.002 --> 28:24.993
Not just you... all of us.

28:27.989 --> 28:29.323
Did he have any friends?

28:29.390 --> 28:31.035
Was there anywhere
he liked to hang out?

28:31.055 --> 28:33.890
Nah, he was a loner.
Computer geek.

28:34.076 --> 28:35.992
He didn't have any friends.

28:36.012 --> 28:38.465
That's pretty much all I know.

28:39.353 --> 28:40.338
Hey.

28:40.358 --> 28:42.175
Having no luck tracking down Adam Lane.

28:42.195 --> 28:43.808
It's like he went off the grid.

28:43.828 --> 28:48.631
No tax returns,
no driver's license, no job,

28:48.651 --> 28:50.674
except for a stint at
a funeral home three years ago.

28:50.694 --> 28:52.345
That must be
how he knows about anatomy.

28:52.413 --> 28:53.513
What about his parents?

28:53.581 --> 28:55.923
Uh, father wasn't in the picture.
Mother died about a year ago.

28:55.943 --> 28:57.784
Esposito: Hey, get this...

28:57.852 --> 29:00.558
I ran down Tim Witherspoon, Lane's bully.

29:00.578 --> 29:02.475
Turns out he's dead.

29:02.495 --> 29:03.753
Unsolved homicide.

29:03.773 --> 29:05.647
He was stabbed in his apartment
10 months ago.

29:05.667 --> 29:07.563
That's right after Lane's mother died.

29:07.583 --> 29:08.854
Maybe that's what triggered him.

29:08.874 --> 29:11.364
So, he murdered Witherspoon,
took his revenge,

29:11.431 --> 29:13.432
but that wasn't enough for him.

29:13.500 --> 29:14.800
Where did lane and his mom live?

29:14.868 --> 29:16.468
Well, the apartment sold
when she died,

29:16.536 --> 29:19.113
but they lived on Avenue C at East 5th.

29:19.133 --> 29:20.312
Esposito: That's the Lower East Side.

29:20.332 --> 29:22.040
Ever since we released Lane's photo,

29:22.108 --> 29:24.276
we've had multiple tips that
he'd been seen in that area.

29:24.343 --> 29:26.612
Anti-social kid like Lane who's
never made his way in the world

29:26.679 --> 29:28.909
is gonna stay
with what's familiar.

29:28.929 --> 29:30.783
Lower East Side's the only
neighborhood he's ever known.

29:30.850 --> 29:32.484
Who bought his mother's place?

29:32.552 --> 29:34.286
Uh... old Russian couple.

29:34.353 --> 29:36.521
But the basement is a rental unit.

29:36.541 --> 29:39.185
Who wants to bet Lane's still living there?

29:55.878 --> 29:58.657
Adam Lane, you're under arrest for murder.

29:59.427 --> 30:00.871
Lane: [Laughs]

30:00.891 --> 30:02.740
What's so funny?

30:03.447 --> 30:05.289
You'll see. [Cellphone buzzes]

30:12.052 --> 30:12.856
Beckett.

30:12.876 --> 30:14.891
- We got a problem.
- Beckett: What's the problem?

30:14.960 --> 30:16.327
We got Adam Lane in custody.

30:16.394 --> 30:17.794
Esposito: Well, he's got people
in custody, too.

30:17.862 --> 30:19.529
It just showed up
on the Netslayer feed.

30:19.597 --> 30:20.927
What people?

30:20.947 --> 30:23.677
Oren and Kent Wilder
from Snappamatic.

30:25.265 --> 30:27.804
[Computer chiming]

30:29.741 --> 30:32.099
They're about to be
his next victims.

30:43.114 --> 30:44.732
Castle: "Like me or I die."

30:44.752 --> 30:46.184
It's a popularity contest.

30:46.204 --> 30:47.727
And Kent is losing.

30:47.747 --> 30:48.968
[Computer chimes]

30:48.988 --> 30:50.891
These guys' photos update
every five seconds,

30:50.911 --> 30:51.983
along with their votes.

30:52.003 --> 30:53.524
They're both attached to electrical leads.

30:53.591 --> 30:55.092
Which probably lead to a power supply

30:55.160 --> 30:56.125
controlled by a computer.

30:56.193 --> 30:58.227
That countdown started at one hour.

30:58.295 --> 31:00.669
- Once it reaches zero...
- Whichever brother has the least votes

31:00.689 --> 31:02.231
gets his heart stopped.

31:02.299 --> 31:03.752
Or they both do.

31:03.772 --> 31:05.067
[Sighs]

31:05.087 --> 31:06.680
It's the ultimate attack on social media.

31:06.700 --> 31:08.225
And us.

31:08.245 --> 31:10.335
He wants us to feel powerless.

31:10.355 --> 31:12.708
Those guys are gonna die
even though he's in custody.

31:12.776 --> 31:14.268
Not if we get to them first.

31:14.288 --> 31:16.936
Esposito: In 37 minutes?
How are we gonna do that?

31:16.956 --> 31:18.514
They're in front of tarps.

31:18.582 --> 31:20.249
There's no background detail.

31:20.317 --> 31:22.487
These guys could be anywhere.

31:22.507 --> 31:24.053
Maybe even in separate places.

31:24.121 --> 31:25.555
Go to the Snappamatic offices.

31:25.622 --> 31:27.568
Maybe they'll help us track down
the source of these photos

31:27.588 --> 31:29.355
now that Kent and Oren's lives
are at stake.

31:31.080 --> 31:33.395
What are you gonna do?

31:33.909 --> 31:36.193
I'm gonna make Adam Lane talk.

31:48.478 --> 31:51.246
So, who's ahead, Oren or Kent?

31:52.708 --> 31:54.437
Time isn't just running out
for them, Adam.

31:54.457 --> 31:56.351
It's running out for you, as well.

31:56.828 --> 32:00.780
Your one and only window of opportunity
is about to close.

32:01.686 --> 32:03.290
Got nothing to say.

32:03.758 --> 32:06.178
Look, I'm not gonna lie to you.
You are going to prison.

32:06.198 --> 32:08.829
But if you tell me
where Kent and Oren are,

32:08.896 --> 32:11.698
then you can still control
what kind of prison.

32:13.016 --> 32:14.348
What's the expression?

32:14.368 --> 32:16.469
Three hots and a cot?

32:16.863 --> 32:18.468
Works for me.

32:18.488 --> 32:20.674
Yeah, well, you're not gonna be saying that

32:20.742 --> 32:23.360
if you get sent to the supermax unit,

32:23.695 --> 32:27.145
where we put our most dangerous
and violent inmates.

32:27.165 --> 32:31.339
You'll be on lockdown there 24/7
for the rest of your life.

32:31.737 --> 32:34.049
Can't be any worse
than high school.

32:34.069 --> 32:35.658
Really?

32:35.844 --> 32:38.239
And you think that you were bullied?

32:39.070 --> 32:42.028
Well, prison is going to take you places

32:42.048 --> 32:44.664
that you can't imagine.

32:44.731 --> 32:48.539
Guy like you, young, teachable.

32:49.147 --> 32:50.430
Doesn't matter.

32:50.450 --> 32:52.038
I already have what I want.

32:52.105 --> 32:54.040
And what do you think you have?

32:54.684 --> 32:56.208
A legacy.

32:57.265 --> 32:58.804
The Internet is permanent.

32:58.824 --> 33:01.880
The Netslayer will live forever.

33:02.366 --> 33:05.116
I'll be mentioned in the same breath
as Manson and the Zodiac.

33:05.185 --> 33:10.824
And... if I commit a murder
while in police custody,

33:11.097 --> 33:13.158
while looking you in the eye,

33:13.989 --> 33:16.793
I could argue I did them one better.

33:17.166 --> 33:20.188
There's nothing you can do to stop me.

33:20.208 --> 33:22.934
Adam, you need help.

33:23.402 --> 33:24.402
You're sick.

33:24.469 --> 33:26.877
- Let me get you...
- I'm sick?

33:28.507 --> 33:30.046
[Scoffs]

33:30.066 --> 33:32.743
Nobody had to follow me.

33:32.811 --> 33:35.646
No one has to vote for Kent or Oren.

33:35.714 --> 33:36.914
But they can't help themselves.

33:36.981 --> 33:38.421
They... they want to be a part of it.

33:38.441 --> 33:42.899
They have to watch.
So... who is really sick?

33:45.728 --> 33:47.925
He wasn't always like that.

33:47.945 --> 33:49.526
If I could go back and do it over again...

33:49.594 --> 33:51.561
You didn't make him this way.

33:51.581 --> 33:53.097
Yeah, but I didn't stop it.

33:53.164 --> 33:55.056
And now I can't stop
these two guys from dying.

33:55.076 --> 33:58.635
If anyone can break him,
it's Detective Beckett.

33:58.898 --> 34:01.864
And there's still a chance
Snappamatic can help us.

34:06.494 --> 34:07.578
How we doing?

34:07.598 --> 34:10.213
Coding's not like flipping a switch.
It takes a little while.

34:10.233 --> 34:11.726
We don't have a while, Evan.

34:11.746 --> 34:13.717
We have... 15 minutes
to find these guys.

34:13.784 --> 34:15.252
I'm going as fast as I can.

34:15.319 --> 34:16.820
Kent was working on a software patch

34:16.840 --> 34:19.202
that would disable
the program's privacy protocols.

34:19.222 --> 34:20.493
And if we disable the protocols,

34:20.513 --> 34:21.757
we can track where
these photos are coming from?

34:21.824 --> 34:22.658
- Yes.
- Yeah.

34:22.726 --> 34:23.826
I mean, in theory.

34:23.893 --> 34:25.655
The thing is, we've never done it before.

34:25.675 --> 34:27.326
I don't know if it'll work.

34:30.414 --> 34:33.559
Our canvass didn't turn up a
single witness to the abduction.

34:33.579 --> 34:34.771
We're nowhere, bro.

34:34.838 --> 34:36.005
Tell me you got something.

34:36.072 --> 34:37.156
About to find out.

34:37.176 --> 34:40.074
Okay, let's do this.

34:43.179 --> 34:46.415
[Computers beeping, whirring]

34:47.431 --> 34:48.897
What happened?

34:48.917 --> 34:51.112
System crash. We're locked out.

34:51.547 --> 34:52.545
Well, get it back up.

34:52.565 --> 34:54.568
We got 15 minutes
before these guys are dead.

34:54.588 --> 34:57.056
It takes 20 minutes to reboot.

34:59.935 --> 35:00.841
Garrett: What just happened?

35:00.861 --> 35:03.431
Whatever they were trying didn't go well.
The site just crashed.

35:03.499 --> 35:05.300
So there's no way to trace
those feeds of Oren and Kent

35:05.367 --> 35:07.113
and the timer
will just keep counting down

35:07.133 --> 35:09.437
until one of them is dead?

35:09.825 --> 35:11.723
It's all up to Beckett now.

35:11.743 --> 35:15.442
Adam, just answer one question,
and it might save your life.

35:16.087 --> 35:18.656
Where are Oren and Kent?

35:18.966 --> 35:20.848
[Chuckles] Ah.

35:21.056 --> 35:24.101
If you cops were capable
of doing your jobs, you'd know.

35:24.121 --> 35:26.243
And, looking back, maybe none of this
would have ever happened.

35:26.263 --> 35:29.115
Look, a horrible thing was done to you.

35:29.135 --> 35:33.294
But how is killing two
more people going to fix that?

35:33.314 --> 35:36.264
How is that gonna heal you?
It won't.

35:36.748 --> 35:38.532
It will.

35:39.081 --> 35:41.665
Don't you see that I've already won?

35:41.685 --> 35:43.970
I'll tell you what...

35:44.038 --> 35:47.820
admit that I've won
and I'll give you a hint.

35:48.354 --> 35:51.177
I'll give you a chance
to find Kent or Oren before...

35:51.894 --> 35:53.855
Bzzzzzt!

35:58.087 --> 35:59.514
Fine.

36:00.134 --> 36:01.611
You won.

36:03.632 --> 36:05.307
Now give me the hint.

36:06.349 --> 36:08.037
Changed my mind.

36:10.631 --> 36:11.938
Seven minutes left.

36:11.958 --> 36:13.343
She's got to make a move,
shake him up somehow.

36:13.363 --> 36:14.927
She will.

36:15.398 --> 36:17.165
Beckett: Netslayer.

36:17.185 --> 36:18.575
That's evocative.

36:18.595 --> 36:21.789
I could... I could see
how you would pick that.

36:22.261 --> 36:26.211
I picture a-a hooded figure
in all black,

36:26.361 --> 36:30.082
tall, muscular,
maybe carrying an ax.

36:30.357 --> 36:32.968
But you know what I don't picture, Adam?

36:32.988 --> 36:34.882
What nobody pictures?

36:37.302 --> 36:38.605
You.

36:40.305 --> 36:41.575
You think that you won?

36:41.595 --> 36:43.628
You haven't. Everyone else has.

36:43.696 --> 36:46.932
- What do you mean, "everyone else"?
- Everyone who ever bullied you,

36:47.000 --> 36:50.315
who ever hurt you, belittled you,

36:50.335 --> 36:54.839
who thought that you were weak
and worthless and small.

36:54.907 --> 36:56.574
And you know what, Adam?

36:56.642 --> 36:58.488
- They were right.
- No, they weren't.

36:58.508 --> 37:00.244
I am not any of those things.

37:00.312 --> 37:01.893
You're all of them and worse.

37:01.913 --> 37:04.065
I am what people made me.

37:04.085 --> 37:06.951
You were born this way,
or your mommy made you.

37:07.019 --> 37:10.198
But Tim Witherspoon and the rest
of the kids at school,

37:10.218 --> 37:12.156
they didn't break you.

37:12.502 --> 37:14.673
You were already broken.

37:14.897 --> 37:16.394
They only sensed what you were

37:16.461 --> 37:18.729
and what you
were about to become.

37:18.917 --> 37:20.064
So you know what?

37:20.132 --> 37:24.701
In a way, their bullying wasn't enough.

37:25.221 --> 37:27.037
How can you say that to me?

37:27.675 --> 37:30.206
- I'm the victim here.
- And you're always gonna be a victim.

37:30.226 --> 37:35.336
You think that hiding behind a username
and killing is going to change that?

37:35.356 --> 37:37.257
That won't get you respect.

37:37.277 --> 37:40.856
You're always gonna be
the same pathetic loser that you were!

37:40.876 --> 37:42.147
I'm not a loser!

37:42.167 --> 37:44.380
And when you abducted Kent and Oren,

37:44.400 --> 37:46.713
I bet the two of them looked
at each other and thought,

37:46.733 --> 37:48.091
"are we being punk'd here?"

37:48.159 --> 37:49.292
Believe me, they didn't.

37:49.360 --> 37:50.793
- They think it's a joke.
- They're afraid.

37:50.861 --> 37:52.195
They're... they're terrified.

37:52.263 --> 37:55.416
They're sharing a laugh
right now about you.

37:55.436 --> 37:58.400
They are not laughing!

37:58.717 --> 38:00.894
She just got him to say
that they're together.

38:00.914 --> 38:02.743
Oh, they're laughing.

38:02.763 --> 38:04.406
They're laughing right now.

38:04.426 --> 38:06.858
Lane: Well, not for long.
That clock will hit zero,

38:06.878 --> 38:10.519
and their screams
will echo off the tiled walls

38:10.539 --> 38:13.548
as they take in
their last breath of stale air.

38:13.616 --> 38:17.191
And then they'll both fry.

38:18.618 --> 38:20.489
Tiled walls and stale air?

38:20.556 --> 38:22.790
That was how he talked about
the locker room at his school.

38:22.810 --> 38:24.226
Where Witherspoon put him on video.

38:24.246 --> 38:26.061
He's bringing this thing full circle.

38:26.129 --> 38:27.296
What was the name of that high school?

38:27.364 --> 38:28.597
Harding high,
but they moved to a new campus.

38:28.664 --> 38:31.532
The original building is shut down.

38:31.552 --> 38:33.363
Beckett!

38:57.771 --> 38:59.521
Javi, the wires!

39:01.429 --> 39:03.263
[Breathing heavily]

39:04.376 --> 39:05.753
You okay?

39:08.446 --> 39:09.588
Okay?

39:11.486 --> 39:13.741
[Muffled sobbing]

39:20.319 --> 39:22.576
I just wanted to say thanks
for letting me pitch in.

39:22.596 --> 39:24.674
Are you kidding me? We couldn't
have done this without you.

39:24.694 --> 39:27.664
Yeah, Oren and Kent are alive
because of your help.

39:27.684 --> 39:30.265
Well, it's always good to get a win.

39:33.244 --> 39:35.077
- Well, see ya around.
- See ya around.

39:35.097 --> 39:36.835
See ya.

39:39.180 --> 39:41.834
You know, there used to be
some finality to all of this.

39:41.854 --> 39:45.067
You took a photo, dump it in the box,

39:45.087 --> 39:47.273
and you never see that face again.

39:47.730 --> 39:48.741
Not anymore.

39:48.761 --> 39:51.510
Yeah, Adam lane is gonna be
on the news every night,

39:51.530 --> 39:54.780
be on the web for weeks... months.

39:54.847 --> 39:56.607
Geez, years.

39:57.116 --> 39:58.417
Ironic that by catching him,

39:58.485 --> 40:01.853
we're giving him exactly what
he wanted... more followers.

40:01.921 --> 40:05.274
Well, after this case,
I think I'm ready to unplug,

40:05.294 --> 40:08.093
- stay off the internet for a while.
- Yes, but before you do,

40:08.160 --> 40:11.697
we have one last piece
of internet business.

40:12.408 --> 40:14.066
Come in, you guys. Come in.
Right this way. Right this way.

40:14.133 --> 40:15.133
Martha: Okay.

40:15.201 --> 40:17.035
- After you.
- Ha ha!
