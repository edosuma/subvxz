teacher like you.

11:36.495 --> 11:37.562
(GRUNTS)

11:41.033 --> 11:42.367
(SIGHS)

11:48.407 --> 11:49.474
Hey.

11:50.142 --> 11:51.710
Not now, Ezra.

11:52.344 --> 11:55.980
Look... I just wanted to
say I know what it's like.

11:55.982 --> 11:57.082
Believe me,

11:57.084 --> 11:58.717
Kanan's not the easiest
teacher to have,

11:58.719 --> 12:00.685
but he means well.

12:00.687 --> 12:03.388
(SCOFFS) Does he?
Do any of them?

12:05.091 --> 12:06.524
I know how to fight.

12:06.526 --> 12:09.194
I believe I can learn
to use that sword.

12:09.196 --> 12:12.197
I just don't
want everything
that comes with it.

12:12.199 --> 12:14.065
You mean your family?

12:14.067 --> 12:16.267
I'm a disgrace
to them, Ezra.

12:16.269 --> 12:17.435
A traitor.

12:17.437 --> 12:18.670
But that's not true.

12:18.672 --> 12:20.638
To them it is.

12:21.373 --> 12:22.574
You don't know.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.009
No one does.

12:31.917 --> 12:34.419
I don't want to talk
about these things.

12:34.421 --> 12:36.855
How can I lead my people?

12:36.857 --> 12:39.357
How can I go back there
and face them?

12:39.959 --> 12:41.192
I'm sorry, Sabine.

12:44.930 --> 12:46.965
At least you have parents
to go back to.

12:53.906 --> 12:55.807
(SIGHS) Ezra...

13:02.414 --> 13:05.550
(RUMBLING)

13:10.322 --> 13:13.758
<i>Teaching Ezra wasn't easy,</i>
<i>but you did it well.</i>

13:13.760 --> 13:16.294
<i>I'm sure you'll find a way</i>
<i>to get through to Sabine.</i>

13:16.296 --> 13:19.264
It's not the same.
Ezra was eager to learn.

13:19.266 --> 13:21.299
(CHUCKLES)
Sometimes too eager.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.001
I was the one
who was holding back.

13:23.003 --> 13:24.903
<i>And that's not</i>
<i>what you're doing now?</i>

13:24.905 --> 13:26.504
No.

13:26.506 --> 13:30.775
<i>And yet, you still won't let</i>
<i>her train with the darksaber.</i>

13:30.777 --> 13:32.811
Look, Sabine is
a capable warrior.

13:32.813 --> 13:35.580
In some ways,
more so than Ezra,
but she can't...

13:35.582 --> 13:38.983
or won't find balance
within herself.

13:38.985 --> 13:41.753
Until she does,
wielding an
actual lightsaber

13:41.755 --> 13:43.188
is far too dangerous
for her.

13:43.190 --> 13:45.156
<i>By letting her pretend</i>
<i>with that stick,</i>

13:45.158 --> 13:48.126
<i>you're only encouraging her</i>
<i>not to commit to this.</i>

13:48.128 --> 13:49.327
You're not
listening to me.

13:49.329 --> 13:52.964
If I let her use
the darksaber,
she will get hurt.

13:52.966 --> 13:54.432
<i>She's already hurt.</i>

13:56.502 --> 13:59.103
<i>Her family hurt her</i>
<i>more than any sword could.</i>

13:59.105 --> 14:02.507
<i>You don't see it because</i>
<i>she doesn't want you to.</i>

14:02.509 --> 14:04.209
But you can?

14:04.211 --> 14:06.211
<i>Because I know</i>
<i>what it's like</i>

14:06.213 --> 14:09.113
<i>when people you love</i>
<i>don't believe in you,</i>

14:09.115 --> 14:10.882
<i>when they let you walk away.</i>

14:10.884 --> 14:13.618
<i>Remember how hard it was</i>
<i>for her to trust us.</i>

14:14.320 --> 14:15.453
(SIGHS)

14:16.155 --> 14:17.488
Hmm.

14:17.490 --> 14:19.123
So what do you
want me to do?

14:19.125 --> 14:20.525
<i>Give her the sword.</i>

14:20.527 --> 14:23.494
<i>Let her own it</i>
<i>and who she is.</i>

14:23.496 --> 14:25.830
<i>Help Sabine face her demons.</i>

14:25.832 --> 14:28.233
(SIGHS) I don't know.

14:28.235 --> 14:30.034
<i>I know you don't.</i>

14:30.036 --> 14:31.803
<i>But this isn't about you.</i>

14:42.181 --> 14:44.048
I didn't think
she'd be gone this long.

14:44.050 --> 14:46.417
She'll return.
Then we'll see.

14:47.920 --> 14:49.654
I know she can do it,

14:49.656 --> 14:53.358
but it just seems like
Kanan is asking her to
learn everything at once.

14:53.360 --> 14:55.493
She just needs more time.

14:55.495 --> 14:57.328
Time is a luxury,

14:57.330 --> 14:59.797
one the galaxy
seems to be
running out of.

15:12.578 --> 15:13.645
She's back.

15:28.594 --> 15:30.161
I owe you an apology.

15:31.463 --> 15:33.097
I can say the same.

15:50.249 --> 15:53.584
Uh, maybe I should
practice more first.

15:53.586 --> 15:55.853
Take it.
It's yours.

16:05.597 --> 16:06.698
Ignite the blade.

16:07.566 --> 16:08.766
(DARKSABER ACTIVATING)

16:08.768 --> 16:10.001
Whoa.

16:11.904 --> 16:14.272
It's heavier than I thought.

16:14.274 --> 16:16.574
Energy constantly flows
through the crystal.

16:16.576 --> 16:18.476
You're not fighting
with a simple blade

16:18.478 --> 16:21.412
as much as
you are directing
a current of power.

16:21.414 --> 16:24.515
Your thoughts, your actions,
they become energy.

16:24.517 --> 16:26.417
They flow through
the crystal as well,

16:26.419 --> 16:28.486
and become a part
of the blade.

16:29.488 --> 16:31.089
(LIGHTSABER ACTIVATING)

16:33.959 --> 16:35.693
The blades will be
drawn to each other.

16:36.929 --> 16:38.029
Block high.

16:38.031 --> 16:40.531
(BLADES CRACKLING)

16:40.533 --> 16:42.900
There's pull.
Can you feel it?

16:44.303 --> 16:47.638
That sword is old,
heavy, but powerful.

16:47.640 --> 16:49.374
Respect its strength.

16:49.376 --> 16:51.542
(BLADES WHOOSHING)

16:51.544 --> 16:53.311
Block low.

16:53.313 --> 16:54.412
High.

16:54.947 --> 16:56.180
Middle.

16:56.548 --> 16:57.749
High.

16:58.317 --> 16:59.784
Low.

16:59.786 --> 17:00.952
Middle.

17:02.187 --> 17:04.655
Good. Let's work
on a series.

17:04.657 --> 17:06.424
Are you ready?
Yes.

17:11.964 --> 17:14.065
Remember the forms
Ezra taught you.

17:14.067 --> 17:15.700
Take ready position.

17:17.369 --> 17:18.536
We'll start slow.

17:20.239 --> 17:22.740
One...two...

17:22.742 --> 17:24.075
three...

17:24.077 --> 17:26.477
four...five...

17:26.479 --> 17:27.545
six...

17:27.547 --> 17:28.679
Faster.

17:28.681 --> 17:31.549
One, two, three,

17:31.551 --> 17:34.218
four, five, six.

17:34.220 --> 17:36.854
(RAPIDLY)
One, two, three, four,

17:36.856 --> 17:38.589
five, six.

17:41.660 --> 17:43.728
You're making it
easy on me.

17:45.831 --> 17:47.432
Ready position.

17:48.567 --> 17:50.635
(DARKSABER ACTIVATING)

17:53.005 --> 17:55.807
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

17:58.277 --> 17:59.877
The blade feels lighter.

17:59.879 --> 18:01.279
You're connecting
with it.

18:01.281 --> 18:03.181
It's becoming
a part of you.

18:05.951 --> 18:09.053
(GRUNTING)

18:09.055 --> 18:11.789
But you cannot rely
solely on the blade.

18:13.025 --> 18:14.625
(YELLS)

18:15.861 --> 18:18.396
You must use all
your skills together.

Ready position.

18:21.233 --> 18:23.301
(BLADES CRACKLING)

18:24.736 --> 18:25.670
You'll have to do better.

18:31.143 --> 18:32.577
Whoa.

(GRUNTS IN PAIN)

18:43.555 --> 18:45.623
You're not fighting me,

you're fighting yourself...

18:47.760 --> 18:49.327
and losing.

18:49.329 --> 18:50.661
(GRUNTS ANGRILY)

18:51.964 --> 18:53.764
You're not committed
to this.

18:53.766 --> 18:54.832
You should quit.

18:54.834 --> 18:57.368
I don't quit.
I never quit!

19:00.139 --> 19:02.073
Really? That's not
what it looks like.

19:02.075 --> 19:03.274
(GRUNTS)

19:03.276 --> 19:05.243
You did run,
didn't you?
No!

19:07.412 --> 19:09.447
But that's what
your people believe,
isn't it?

19:09.449 --> 19:11.182
(GROWLS)

19:11.184 --> 19:14.685
You ran from the Empire.
You ran from your family.

19:14.687 --> 19:17.488
So what's the truth?
(LIGHTSABER ACTIVATING)

19:17.490 --> 19:19.690
(ENERGY CRACKLING)

19:19.692 --> 19:22.493
The truth... is that...

19:22.495 --> 19:24.395
I left to save everyone.

19:26.298 --> 19:29.433
My mother, my father,

19:29.435 --> 19:30.768
my brother!

19:32.171 --> 19:34.872
Everything I did
was for family,

19:34.874 --> 19:36.040
for Mandalore!

19:36.875 --> 19:38.609
I built weapons,

19:38.611 --> 19:40.511
terrible weapons,

19:40.513 --> 19:42.980
but the Empire used them
on Mandalore,

19:42.982 --> 19:46.384
on friends, on family.

19:46.386 --> 19:47.685
People that I knew.

19:47.687 --> 19:49.854
They controlled us
through fear.

19:49.856 --> 19:51.889
(SCOFFS)
Mandalore!

19:51.891 --> 19:54.692
Fear of weapons
I helped create.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.794
I helped enslave my people!

19:59.031 --> 20:00.698
I wanted to stop it.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.466
I had to stop it.

20:02.468 --> 20:03.834
I spoke out!

20:03.836 --> 20:07.205
I spoke out to save them.
To save everyone!

20:07.207 --> 20:08.372
(GRUNTS)

20:10.976 --> 20:12.610
But when I did...

20:16.682 --> 20:18.449
My family didn't
stand with me.

20:19.051 --> 20:21.519
They chose the Empire.

20:21.521 --> 20:22.753
They left me.

20:24.489 --> 20:25.823
Gave me no choice.

20:27.859 --> 20:30.761
The Empire wanted
to destroy worlds.

20:30.763 --> 20:32.897
And they did.

20:32.899 --> 20:34.732
(VOICE BREAKING)
They destroyed mine.

20:34.734 --> 20:36.500
(SOBBING)

20:37.736 --> 20:39.437
The Empire rules
with fear.

20:39.439 --> 20:41.906
And not everyone can be
as strong as you've been.

20:41.908 --> 20:43.941
Your family
is in a prison,

20:43.943 --> 20:46.077
one of their own making.

20:46.079 --> 20:47.812
It's up to you
to help them out of it.

20:53.418 --> 20:54.785
But how?

20:55.621 --> 20:57.121
Why?

20:57.123 --> 20:58.923
Why would they
believe me?

20:58.925 --> 21:00.758
Why would they
follow me?

21:00.760 --> 21:02.927
FENN: I know this might not be
what you want to hear.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.895
But for what it's worth,

21:05.931 --> 21:07.632
I would follow you.

21:11.303 --> 21:12.870
EZRA: So would I.

21:13.939 --> 21:15.906
And I mean it.

21:15.908 --> 21:18.609
You've come a long way
in a very short time.

21:18.611 --> 21:20.711
Where you go from here
is up to you.

21:20.713 --> 21:22.780
But know, this family,

21:22.782 --> 21:24.949
will stand by you
no matter what you choose.
