31:09.034 --> 31:11.068
Hold on.
Bill collectors.

31:11.070 --> 31:13.971
You're hired.

31:13.973 --> 31:16.573
Clean up on aisle 10.

31:16.575 --> 31:19.509
Oh, he is not
talking to me, is he?

31:19.511 --> 31:22.779
Yes. He is.

31:22.781 --> 31:27.217
Uh, fourteen.

31:27.219 --> 31:29.052
Thirteen.

31:43.969 --> 31:45.769
Idaho. Hey.
Where's the beer?

31:45.771 --> 31:47.905
There's no beer.
What do you mean?

31:47.907 --> 31:49.706
Hilly didn't pay the bill.

31:49.708 --> 31:51.141
Same reason there's no phone.

31:51.143 --> 31:53.143
We don't need a phone.
We have a payphone.

31:53.145 --> 31:57.614
We're a bar.
We need beer!

31:57.616 --> 31:59.016
Jesus Christ.
Look at this!

31:59.018 --> 32:00.984
Will you-Look at
the size of that rat.

32:00.986 --> 32:02.252
Don't point at him.
Why?

32:02.254 --> 32:03.954
It upsets him.
Who?

32:03.956 --> 32:05.322
Bert.

32:05.324 --> 32:07.357
Bert.
Bert the rat?

32:07.359 --> 32:08.592
We have a deal.

32:08.594 --> 32:09.893
What are you talking about?

32:09.895 --> 32:11.528
He doesn't bite me
if I feed him.

32:11.530 --> 32:14.064
Hilly spent a fortune on
exterminating cockroaches

32:14.066 --> 32:15.799
and you're feeding
the fucking rats?

32:15.801 --> 32:17.701
Shh!

32:17.703 --> 32:19.269
He's listening.

32:19.271 --> 32:20.837
You're gonna make him mad!

32:20.839 --> 32:23.307
How's the chili?
Bert likes it.

32:23.309 --> 32:24.975
If Bert doesn't eat it,

32:24.977 --> 32:26.910
I know can't feed it
to anybody else.

32:26.912 --> 32:29.913
Well, as long as Bert likes it.

32:32.050 --> 32:34.618
Get rid of Bert.
Right now.

32:34.620 --> 32:37.120
And find some beer.

32:40.558 --> 32:44.261

33:11.356 --> 33:14.057
[Woman] I prefer the
term underground rock.

33:14.059 --> 33:16.960
"Underground"
implies secretive.

33:19.397 --> 33:21.798
There's something
precious about that to me.

33:21.800 --> 33:24.067
Punk, on the other hand,
it's in your face.

33:24.069 --> 33:27.804
It's sarcastic,
ironic, cutting.

33:27.806 --> 33:29.506
So you're a punk.

33:29.508 --> 33:31.274
Yeah.
I am too.

33:31.276 --> 33:34.578
I'm an illustrator,
and I'm starting a magazine.

33:34.580 --> 33:37.948
<i>Yeah, it's called punk.</i>

33:37.950 --> 33:39.449
And your punk magazine

33:39.451 --> 33:42.252
is going to hold forth
the losers as winners.

33:42.254 --> 33:46.056
Deify the freaks and outcasts
of the underground-

33:46.058 --> 33:49.026
I mean downtown music scene.

33:49.028 --> 33:50.293
Yes.

33:50.295 --> 33:52.996
Thou shalt keep no gods,

33:52.998 --> 33:56.266
especially fossils like
Eric Clapton and zeppelin.

33:58.469 --> 34:01.571
You wanna write
for the magazine?

34:01.573 --> 34:06.209
What's a degree
from Oxford for anyway?

34:06.211 --> 34:09.312
To impress
your parents' friends.

34:09.313 --> 34:10.981
I'm John.

TV set band on tonight?</i>

34:33.972 --> 34:35.205
Yes. Television.

34:35.206 --> 34:36.840
David bowie
says that television

34:36.842 --> 34:39.242
is the most original band
in New York.

34:39.244 --> 34:41.344
[Telephone rings]

34:41.346 --> 34:43.246
CBGB.

34:43.248 --> 34:44.547
If that's what you want,

34:44.550 --> 34:47.070
I can take care of it for you.

35:07.405 --> 35:11.608
Coming to you from
the bowery of New York City...

35:11.610 --> 35:14.778
Television!

35:14.780 --> 35:19.082
You know I I jump outta bed

35:20.551 --> 35:24.187
I pull down the shade

35:24.189 --> 35:27.357
I used to have
such sweet dreams

35:27.359 --> 35:31.428
Now it's more like
an air raid

35:31.430 --> 35:34.865
I see the opposition clear

35:34.867 --> 35:37.734
I see them glare

35:37.736 --> 35:40.003
I don't care

35:40.005 --> 35:42.172
it doesn't matter to me

35:42.174 --> 35:45.342
I don't care

35:45.344 --> 35:48.712
I don't care

35:56.655 --> 36:00.290
Somersault through walls

36:00.292 --> 36:03.560
can't tell,
it's really so odd

36:03.562 --> 36:04.828
Is it spring or fall?

36:04.830 --> 36:06.196
I always thought a punk

36:06.198 --> 36:09.733
was someone
who took it up the ass.

36:09.735 --> 36:12.102
They said they met
at art school.

36:12.104 --> 36:14.237
Looks like
they sniffed some fumes

36:14.239 --> 36:16.506
from all that paint and glue.

36:16.508 --> 36:19.609
Tell 'em to wait.
Okay. Why?

36:19.611 --> 36:22.846
I'm going to see if I can
increase the size of the house.

36:24.215 --> 36:26.082
Chief!

36:26.084 --> 36:27.584
Just a minute.

36:27.586 --> 36:30.053
We're gonna see if we
can get more people to...

36:30.055 --> 36:31.888
Come in and listen to you.

36:31.890 --> 36:34.257

37:01.085 --> 37:05.188
Look at that!
Off duty.

37:05.190 --> 37:07.591
Two beers.

37:12.396 --> 37:15.031

is talking heads.

37:15.033 --> 37:17.867
We live across the street.

37:43.327 --> 37:47.664
I can't seem to face
up to the facts

37:47.666 --> 37:51.568
I'm tense and nervous
and I can't relax

37:51.570 --> 37:55.438

43:43.221 --> 43:44.921
Oh, yeah.
He's one of us.

43:44.923 --> 43:47.924
Thank you.

43:47.926 --> 43:49.926
He's a shit.

43:49.928 --> 43:52.261
What are you talking about?

43:52.263 --> 43:54.530
What kind of stupid
question is that?

43:54.532 --> 43:57.734
Okay- do I ask you
what you like?

43:57.736 --> 43:59.435
Who gives a fuck what I like?

43:59.437 --> 44:01.204
I don't even
give a fuck what I like.

44:01.206 --> 44:03.272
Well, you're a rock star, man.

44:03.274 --> 44:07.710
Oh, yeah.
I keep forgetting.

44:07.712 --> 44:12.181
Sontag called it the sensibility
of failed seriousness.

44:24.995 --> 44:26.963
What's their name?

44:26.965 --> 44:30.166
The Ramones.

44:30.168 --> 44:33.736
Look like they were raised
under police lamps.

44:38.809 --> 44:42.129
[Hilly] What do you
guys have for me?

44:44.982 --> 44:47.650
We got four songs:

44:47.652 --> 44:50.186
<i>I don't wanna
walk around with you,</i>

44:50.188 --> 44:51.621
<i>I don't wanna be learned,</i>

44:51.623 --> 44:53.356
<i>I don't wanna be tamed,</i>

44:53.358 --> 44:57.727
<i>and I don't wanna go
down to the basement.</i>

44:57.729 --> 44:59.195
Lot of things
you don't wanna do.

44:59.197 --> 45:00.596
Yeah.

45:00.598 --> 45:03.299
Anything you wanna do?

45:03.301 --> 45:06.202
We're working on something now.

45:06.204 --> 45:08.071
Something positive?

45:08.073 --> 45:13.009
<i>Yeah. It's-it's called
I wanna sniff some glue.</i>

45:13.011 --> 45:15.945
Good to have a point of view.

45:19.149 --> 45:21.184
One, two, three, four!

45:21.186 --> 45:23.119
[Dischordant music]

45:26.790 --> 45:28.057
What the fuck are you playing?

45:28.059 --> 45:31.794
Ah, fuck!

45:31.796 --> 45:35.364
You guys wanna try it again?
Yeah.

45:35.366 --> 45:37.533
Is Johnny coming back?
[Glass breaks]

45:37.535 --> 45:39.202
What are we playing?
Johnny!

45:39.204 --> 45:41.104
Johnny?

45:41.106 --> 45:44.407
[Johnny] Fuck!

45:44.409 --> 45:45.641

Sittin' in a hospital bed

45:50.682 --> 45:54.350
Sittin' in a hospital bed

45:54.352 --> 45:58.254
sittin' in a hospital bed

45:58.256 --> 46:01.791
I- I want life

46:01.793 --> 46:05.461
I want my life

46:05.463 --> 46:08.631
I want my life

46:08.633 --> 46:13.136
I got knocked down,
but I'll get up

46:21.812 --> 46:25.148
Nobody is gonna like you guys.

46:30.020 --> 46:32.789
But I'll have you back.

46:40.664 --> 46:44.167
The city's going bankrupt.

46:44.169 --> 46:46.435
It's like a disease.

46:46.437 --> 46:49.372
Which I would prefer
not to catch.

46:49.374 --> 46:51.374
Meaning?

46:51.376 --> 46:54.343
We have to get
our affairs in order.

46:56.480 --> 46:58.681
I'm working on it.

46:58.683 --> 47:01.818
Your working
isn't working, hilly.

47:05.989 --> 47:07.390
[Hilly] Coming to you

47:07.392 --> 47:10.960
from the bowery
of New York City,

47:10.962 --> 47:12.795
Wayne county.

47:15.332 --> 47:17.834
Hello, sex kittens!

47:17.836 --> 47:19.702
Eat my pussy!

47:19.704 --> 47:22.171
Wish I had one.
Oh!

47:22.173 --> 47:23.639
[Cheers, whistling]

47:23.641 --> 47:25.141
Here we go!
Here we go.

ready, ready!

47:27.145 --> 47:31.414
One, two, three, I'Chaim!

47:31.416 --> 47:33.950
Wanted nothing more

47:33.952 --> 47:37.286
I know you wouldn't go...

47:37.288 --> 47:38.955
No, no, no, no, no!

47:38.957 --> 47:41.924
C'mere.

47:41.926 --> 47:44.160
I'm Nicky Gant!

47:44.162 --> 47:45.695
Nicky fuckin' Gant!

47:45.697 --> 47:46.963
I produce records!

47:46.965 --> 47:49.432
Hilly told me
this was on the house!

47:49.434 --> 47:52.134
No money.

47:52.136 --> 47:53.836
We cool?

47:53.838 --> 47:55.471
You were a marksman

47:55.473 --> 47:57.974
told me that law,
like wine, is ageless

47:57.976 --> 48:00.576
You got any-any chips
or something?

48:06.617 --> 48:10.052
Gonna have to do something
about that stage.

48:12.923 --> 48:14.690
Well, you might want
to think about having fewer

48:14.692 --> 48:16.425
"guests of hilly"
and more paying customers

48:16.427 --> 48:17.660
if you want to pay for it.

48:17.662 --> 48:18.995
I'm with Lisa on this one.

48:18.997 --> 48:21.330
You gotta spend money
to make money.

48:21.332 --> 48:23.933
You gotta have money
to spend money to make money.

48:23.935 --> 48:25.201
And since you spend
all the money you make,

48:25.203 --> 48:26.502
you don't have
any money to spend.

48:26.504 --> 48:27.737
So you might want to think

48:27.739 --> 48:29.005
about saving the money you make

48:29.007 --> 48:31.207
instead of spending
the money you make!

48:34.311 --> 48:36.913
All right. We're gonna
try that one again.

48:36.915 --> 48:39.515
[Audience cheering]

48:47.257 --> 48:49.926
What are you doing?

48:49.928 --> 48:51.560
Damn it, dad.

48:51.562 --> 48:53.162
What, two bankruptcies
wasn't enough for you?

48:53.164 --> 48:54.830
Why not go for three?
Stop.

48:54.832 --> 48:56.332
No, I'm taking over
the finances.

48:56.334 --> 48:57.867
No, you're not.
You're fired.

48:57.869 --> 49:00.102
You're firing me?

49:00.104 --> 49:03.673
Yeah.
Get the hell out.

49:03.675 --> 49:07.276
I want my life

49:07.278 --> 49:10.513
I want my life

49:12.649 --> 49:16.852
things are not
gonna work out with her.

49:16.854 --> 49:18.921
Everything all right, hilly?

49:18.923 --> 49:20.723
[Man] Hey, so, Debbie,

49:20.725 --> 49:23.526
who were the people you,
you know, idolized as an artist?

49:23.528 --> 49:26.095
Fuck, you know, I always
really liked Brigitte Bardot.

49:26.097 --> 49:28.130
Uh-huh.

49:28.132 --> 49:30.333
I thought she was sort of a
continental punk, you knowYeah.

49:30.335 --> 49:33.669
I always thought sex
was a cool thing to sell.

49:33.671 --> 49:35.304
A sure thing.

49:35.306 --> 49:38.674
I wish I'd invented sex.

49:38.676 --> 49:40.543
You like sex?

49:45.615 --> 49:47.883
God, look at this!

49:47.885 --> 49:49.986
I'm sick of the goddamn fleas
from hilly's dog.

49:49.988 --> 49:52.121
Have you considered boots?

49:52.123 --> 49:54.623
Boots?

50:03.266 --> 50:05.501
Can I describe
what it's like

50:05.503 --> 50:10.506
To have sex
with the light on?

50:10.508 --> 50:12.608
And would you feel right

50:12.610 --> 50:16.479
if I did you tonight
and put the bite on?

I'm just a dead boy

I'm just a dead boy

51:15.606 --> 51:19.041
I wanna be a dead boy

51:19.043 --> 51:23.612
I'll die for you
if you want me to

51:23.614 --> 51:25.081
Look out!

51:25.083 --> 51:28.284
Don't tell me.
"There's something there."

51:30.654 --> 51:34.590
There is definitely
something there.

51:34.592 --> 51:37.460
The dead boys.

51:37.462 --> 51:40.629
As long as they don't
take their name too seriously.

51:51.943 --> 51:55.377
That was good.
It was really good.

51:55.379 --> 51:57.513
Thank you, sir.
That means a lot, you know?

51:57.515 --> 52:00.216
Your dog is crapping
on the floor, sir.

52:00.218 --> 52:02.718
Yeah, he does that.

Where you guys from?

52:06.390 --> 52:07.857
Cleveland, sir.

52:07.859 --> 52:11.093
Well, I'm impressed
with the youth of Cleveland.

52:11.095 --> 52:13.095
Oh, you shouldn't be.
Why not?

52:13.097 --> 52:15.197
Lotta losers.

52:15.199 --> 52:19.268
Well, you seem awfully polite.

52:19.270 --> 52:21.804
Yeah, well, we were altar boys.

52:21.806 --> 52:23.606
That was a while ago.

52:23.608 --> 52:25.608
Look, Mr. Kristal,
do we get the gig here or not?

52:25.610 --> 52:27.309
Yeah.
No shit!

52:27.311 --> 52:28.744
Holy fuck.

52:28.746 --> 52:31.313
Spoken like a true altar boy.

52:43.660 --> 52:46.595
[Woman] Some say punk promotes
a message of violence.

52:46.597 --> 52:49.665
I mean, what we're doing is not
really destructive, you know?

52:49.667 --> 52:53.002
So it's not a statement
of aggression?

52:53.004 --> 52:57.206
We're just letting out
a little energy and frustration.

52:57.208 --> 52:58.741
And where better to do that?

52:58.743 --> 53:00.709
Here or on the streets?

53:00.711 --> 53:03.145
Good point.
Hi, mom!

53:03.147 --> 53:05.814
Uh, yeah.

53:05.816 --> 53:07.383
It's actually really healthy.

53:07.385 --> 53:09.652
So what kind of girls
do you like?

53:09.654 --> 53:11.654
All kinds.

53:15.559 --> 53:17.493
I like the ones that like to
fuck and leave in the morning.

53:17.495 --> 53:21.163
Stiv, she just wants
to give you a blowjob.

53:23.166 --> 53:26.068
Cut.

53:26.070 --> 53:29.939
I dare you.

53:29.941 --> 53:32.741
You know better
than to dare me.

53:45.188 --> 53:47.923
Hot flashes
burning my brain

Your tongue lashes
drive me insane

You're known
as the hottest lay

53:55.166 --> 53:57.866
And ya pink canopy
gonna shackle ya down

53:57.868 --> 54:00.402
You crossed
every back in town

54:00.404 --> 54:03.239
From a cherry runaway
to a bowery queen

54:03.241 --> 54:05.874
Used up before
your sweet sixteen

54:05.876 --> 54:07.576
Everyone knows

the meat in your mouth

54:24.361 --> 54:26.395
Whoo!

54:26.397 --> 54:28.731
Look for love
on a one-way street

54:28.733 --> 54:31.734
Bedding down with every-

54:31.736 --> 54:33.969
a- stripping and a-dancing
and a-buying some downs

54:33.971 --> 54:36.805
See?
It's not all about violence!

54:36.807 --> 54:39.975
Cut! Cut!

54:42.279 --> 54:44.146
Yeah, stiv!

Oh, shit.

55:04.601 --> 55:06.568
Fresca.

55:06.570 --> 55:09.438
On the house.

55:09.440 --> 55:11.573
Stan.

55:14.344 --> 55:17.913
You know I got nothing
against you, right?

55:17.915 --> 55:19.415
I like to think anyone

55:19.417 --> 55:24.053
who shares a drink in my club
is my friend.

55:24.055 --> 55:27.690
Well, as your friend,

55:27.692 --> 55:29.224
we've had some complaints.

55:30.660 --> 55:33.929
About what?

55:33.931 --> 55:36.598
Hey, hilly.

55:41.304 --> 55:43.806
Uh, excuse me.

55:46.476 --> 55:50.412
Now, I'm just
the messenger here, all right?

55:50.414 --> 55:52.414
But I understand the complaints

55:52.416 --> 55:54.383
are about the...

55:54.385 --> 55:58.487
Element your club attracts.

55:58.489 --> 55:59.988
Are you kidding me?

55:59.990 --> 56:03.592
If anything,
I'm cleaning the street up.

56:03.594 --> 56:06.261
I am just the messenger here.

56:06.263 --> 56:07.796
I mean,
people bigger than you and I

56:07.798 --> 56:12.601
are tugging the strings
and stirring the shit.

56:12.603 --> 56:14.470
And I also understand

56:14.472 --> 56:18.807
that you're three months
behind on your rent.

56:18.809 --> 56:21.577
Now that kind of thing
just doesn't help.

56:21.579 --> 56:24.113
Pay your bills, Kristal.

56:24.115 --> 56:26.582
Pay your fuckin' bills.

56:45.902 --> 56:48.904
I don't like that guy.

56:56.079 --> 56:58.247
I got a spirit in my house

56:58.249 --> 56:59.481
and I know
it ain't no...

56:59.483 --> 57:01.016
I know you got more junk, man.

57:01.018 --> 57:02.484
Come on.
Give me the fuckin' drug.

57:02.486 --> 57:04.087
Come on, Idaho.
Give me the fuckin' drug.

57:09.959 --> 57:13.429
Not in... my club!

57:19.169 --> 57:23.038
[Idaho] Come on, hilly.
Be cool, man.

57:23.040 --> 57:24.807
Like I was saying
previously, Stan,

57:24.809 --> 57:26.575
these two gentlemen

57:26.577 --> 57:29.978
were not abiding by
the rigorous code of ethics

57:29.980 --> 57:34.249
I strive to maintain
in my establishment.

57:37.420 --> 57:41.590
Well, that's not very
good, now, is it, boys?

57:41.592 --> 57:44.059
In my house, in my house

57:46.996 --> 57:48.464
What are we stopping for?

57:48.466 --> 57:50.265
Joey fell off the stage, John.

57:50.267 --> 57:52.234
Fuckin' think
I didn't fuckin' notice?!

57:52.236 --> 57:54.570
Ah, fuck!

57:57.875 --> 58:02.578
I know a girl
from a lonely street

58:02.580 --> 58:05.814

My understanding is that
there is a, uh,

01:05:55.953 --> 01:05:58.286
problem with the rent.

01:05:58.288 --> 01:06:00.889

paid, it comes to me to collect.

I'm forced to double it

the doubling part.

something to you.

what I came here for.

01:11:47.369 --> 01:11:49.070
If the world is ending,

01:11:49.072 --> 01:11:51.339
you might as well
do away with pretense

01:11:51.341 --> 01:11:52.940
and say what you think.

01:11:54.977 --> 01:11:58.813
Uncensored sex!

01:11:58.815 --> 01:12:00.748
And drugs!

01:12:00.750 --> 01:12:02.483
And violence!

01:12:04.119 --> 01:12:05.987
Just everything.

01:12:07.856 --> 01:12:10.158
Decadent sounds
great right now,

01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:12.160
compared to what's
happening in the real world.

01:12:12.162 --> 01:12:14.195
Yeah!

01:12:14.197 --> 01:12:16.998
I don't need anyone

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.200
don't need no mom and dad

01:12:19.202 --> 01:12:21.069
Come on, Genya,
they're charming!

01:12:21.071 --> 01:12:23.638
Hilly, they're punk,
and they're charming?

01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:25.273
I got some news for you

01:12:25.275 --> 01:12:28.476
I want you to produce them,
I think they're special.

01:12:28.478 --> 01:12:31.679
I got my devil machine

01:12:31.681 --> 01:12:33.815
got my electronic dream

01:12:33.817 --> 01:12:36.751
sonic reducer,
ain't no loser

01:12:39.154 --> 01:12:41.889
Sonic reducer,
ain't no loser

01:12:47.463 --> 01:12:50.665
I've been waiting
for you in the office!

01:12:50.667 --> 01:12:53.067
In a minute, Lisa.

01:12:55.404 --> 01:12:57.805
People out on the streets

01:12:57.807 --> 01:13:01.075
they don't know who I am

01:13:01.077 --> 01:13:03.945
I watch them from my room

01:13:03.947 --> 01:13:05.346
Mrs. Kristal!

01:13:05.348 --> 01:13:07.849
Oh, Merv!

01:13:07.851 --> 01:13:09.250
So good to see you!

01:13:09.252 --> 01:13:13.988
Mother, welcome to CBGB.

01:13:13.990 --> 01:13:15.757
Hillel.

01:13:15.759 --> 01:13:18.826
Uh, listen, I need a drink.

01:13:18.828 --> 01:13:20.661
On the house!

01:13:20.663 --> 01:13:23.364
Glenlivet with a twist.

01:13:23.366 --> 01:13:25.933
Coming right up.
Okay.

01:13:25.935 --> 01:13:27.468
We don't have any glenlivet.

01:13:27.470 --> 01:13:29.137
We'll take care of it,
go talk to Lisa.

01:13:29.139 --> 01:13:30.938
Come this way, Mrs. Kristal.

01:13:30.940 --> 01:13:32.940
I have a special spot
for you right over here.

01:13:32.942 --> 01:13:37.345
Excuse me!
Watch your backs!

01:13:37.347 --> 01:13:39.113
This is what you're spending.

01:13:39.115 --> 01:13:40.548
This is what you're making.

01:13:40.550 --> 01:13:41.916
I have to get back out there.

01:13:41.918 --> 01:13:45.753
Give her a minute, hilly.

01:13:45.755 --> 01:13:47.288
You're spending too much.

01:13:47.290 --> 01:13:49.957
You cannot afford
to personally take on a band.

01:13:49.959 --> 01:13:51.692
I agree with Lisa on this.

01:13:51.694 --> 01:13:54.629
Oh, this is about
the dead boys.

01:13:54.631 --> 01:13:56.164
Ye- before we branch out,

01:13:56.166 --> 01:13:57.999
we need to get our
primary business in order.

01:13:58.001 --> 01:14:00.668
And we need to put proper
vendor agreements in place.

01:14:00.670 --> 01:14:02.804
We need to have billing cycles.

01:14:02.806 --> 01:14:04.772
Look here, okay?

01:14:04.774 --> 01:14:08.276
This is what you're
spending on toilet paper.

01:14:08.278 --> 01:14:09.777
I don't believe that.

01:14:09.779 --> 01:14:11.879
You're getting it from
the deli, a lot of it!

01:14:11.881 --> 01:14:14.048
If you buy it in bulk, you can get
it for a fraction of the price.

01:14:14.050 --> 01:14:17.051
This is what you're
spending on beer.

01:14:17.053 --> 01:14:19.954
This is what you are bringing in
on the bar in general.

01:14:19.956 --> 01:14:22.223
Hey, too many customers
are drinking for free!

01:14:22.225 --> 01:14:23.791
This is bullshit.
Hilly, cut it out!

01:14:23.793 --> 01:14:25.593
Why are we talking
about toilet paper?!

01:14:25.595 --> 01:14:27.328
I have Genya Ravan out there

01:14:27.330 --> 01:14:29.330
ready to produce
the dead boys album!

01:14:29.332 --> 01:14:31.032
You're wasting my time!

01:14:31.034 --> 01:14:32.433
Fine.

01:14:32.435 --> 01:14:34.068
Goddamn it, hilly.

01:14:36.538 --> 01:14:39.207
This is quite good!

01:14:40.709 --> 01:14:43.945
Hilly's chili, huh?

01:14:47.216 --> 01:14:49.016
Word is, Stiv Bators

01:14:49.018 --> 01:14:52.520
jerks off in that chili.

01:14:52.522 --> 01:14:54.989
I've had worse in my mouth.

01:14:57.893 --> 01:14:59.760
Everything okay, mother?

01:14:59.762 --> 01:15:01.996
Delicious!

01:15:08.103 --> 01:15:09.704
What are you doing?

01:15:09.706 --> 01:15:12.206
Trying to light a cigarette.

01:15:26.121 --> 01:15:29.190
You shouldn't smoke.

01:15:29.192 --> 01:15:32.527
That shit'll kill ya.

01:15:32.529 --> 01:15:35.997
I don't smoke.

01:15:35.999 --> 01:15:39.600
You know, your old man

01:15:39.602 --> 01:15:41.168
is really not such a bad guy.

01:15:41.170 --> 01:15:45.039
Well, you obviously
don't know him very well.

01:15:45.041 --> 01:15:49.143
Oh God, zip, Idaho!
Please!

01:15:49.145 --> 01:15:51.045
Excuse me.

01:15:51.047 --> 01:15:53.481
Sometimes you hurt

01:15:53.483 --> 01:15:57.518
the ones you love the most.

01:15:57.520 --> 01:16:00.154
What fortune cookie
did you read that in?

01:16:00.156 --> 01:16:02.256
Nah.

01:16:02.258 --> 01:16:06.661
I got it from a poster
in the subway

01:16:06.663 --> 01:16:10.598
across from this bench
I kinda like.

01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:13.568
I prefer rachmaninoff, hillel.

01:16:13.570 --> 01:16:15.536
Yeah, I prefer Beethoven
myself.

01:16:15.538 --> 01:16:17.538
That punk rock shit
gives me a headache.

01:16:17.540 --> 01:16:19.473
No shit.

01:16:34.990 --> 01:16:37.358
Mom was right to leave you.

01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:38.893
You're an asshole.

01:16:38.895 --> 01:16:40.561
Lisa what?

01:16:40.563 --> 01:16:44.966
In my capacity as asshole,

01:16:44.968 --> 01:16:48.836
I am promoting you to vice
president of business affairs.

01:16:48.838 --> 01:16:51.472
Is that supposed to be
some kind of apology?

01:16:51.474 --> 01:16:55.076
The dead boys are gonna
change things for me, Lisa.

01:16:55.078 --> 01:16:56.577
I am gonna get them
a record deal,

01:16:56.579 --> 01:16:58.913
and they are gonna be big!

01:17:10.826 --> 01:17:13.394
I'm so sick of TV

01:17:13.396 --> 01:17:17.031
you know I'm getting
bored of the tubes

01:17:17.033 --> 01:17:19.033
And I'm so sick of romance

01:17:19.035 --> 01:17:21.535
I refuse to chase you, Lisa!

01:17:24.006 --> 01:17:25.606
I've had it, hilly.

01:17:25.608 --> 01:17:27.975
I can't take it anymore!
The fleas and the shit!

01:17:27.977 --> 01:17:29.744
Your dog is crapping
everywhere!

01:17:29.746 --> 01:17:31.345
It's disgusting,
this is not a kennel!

01:17:31.347 --> 01:17:33.681
Either Jonathan goes, or I go!

01:17:36.551 --> 01:17:40.021
Taxi, you don't like it,

01:17:40.023 --> 01:17:42.857
you don't have to work here!

01:17:42.859 --> 01:17:45.926
I don't play my stereo too

01:17:45.928 --> 01:17:49.597
Just wanna get out
on the street fights

01:17:49.599 --> 01:17:52.133
Just ain't nothin' to do

01:17:52.135 --> 01:17:54.301
I get on out of here

01:17:54.303 --> 01:17:57.772
find somethin' to do

01:17:57.774 --> 01:17:59.774
yeah get on out of here

01:17:59.776 --> 01:18:01.442
just ain't nothin' to do

01:18:12.788 --> 01:18:14.755
so, is that your
real hair color,

01:18:14.757 --> 01:18:17.391
or do you just dye it that way?

01:18:17.393 --> 01:18:19.160
Who wants to know?

01:18:19.162 --> 01:18:20.628
Me.

01:18:20.630 --> 01:18:22.763
It's real.

01:18:34.209 --> 01:18:36.911
So, now you know.

01:18:36.913 --> 01:18:39.847
Yeah, we're good.

01:18:57.399 --> 01:19:01.001
So, they vomit, they drop trow,

01:19:01.003 --> 01:19:02.803
they slash themselves,
they bleed,

01:19:02.805 --> 01:19:05.473
they hang themselves,
and that's just on stage.

01:19:05.475 --> 01:19:07.041
I think their on-stage antics

01:19:07.043 --> 01:19:09.610
are evidence of commitment.

01:19:11.947 --> 01:19:13.414
Hilly, I don't want to produce

01:19:13.416 --> 01:19:15.916
a shit album for
a flash-in-the-pan band.

01:19:15.918 --> 01:19:19.453
Fine, I'll find somebody else.

01:19:30.298 --> 01:19:33.667
We're gonna need money.
Yep.

01:19:33.669 --> 01:19:35.636
And we're gonna need
to take them out on the road.

01:19:35.638 --> 01:19:37.872
Yep.

01:19:37.874 --> 01:19:39.740
Cheetah doesn't trust me.

01:19:39.742 --> 01:19:41.575
Cheetah takes too many drugs.

01:19:41.577 --> 01:19:43.911
Sire is interested
in signing you if we

01:19:43.913 --> 01:19:45.613
can show the band is reliable

01:19:45.615 --> 01:19:47.281
and people will pay to see you.

01:19:47.283 --> 01:19:51.752
We are the definition
of reliable.

01:19:55.991 --> 01:20:00.327
What'd I miss?

01:20:00.329 --> 01:20:04.398
Let's make a demo
and get out on the road.

01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:06.467
Hilly, how much money is this?

01:20:06.469 --> 01:20:08.302
We are gonna rock and shock.

01:20:08.304 --> 01:20:10.404
Don't screw this up.

01:20:10.406 --> 01:20:12.406
Scouts honor.

01:20:12.408 --> 01:20:15.442
Yeah, I heard she fucked bowie

01:20:15.444 --> 01:20:18.412
at... at CB's.

01:20:18.414 --> 01:20:20.181
In the bathroom.

01:20:20.183 --> 01:20:23.217
Fuck in a bathroom at CB's,
that's not sanitary.

01:20:27.088 --> 01:20:28.789
What the fuck is that?

01:20:28.791 --> 01:20:30.724
What?

01:20:30.726 --> 01:20:33.294
Get rid of those
fucking things.

01:20:33.296 --> 01:20:36.864
They're just stickers.

01:20:36.866 --> 01:20:39.834
Hilly, your manager- hey!

01:20:39.836 --> 01:20:41.335
Hilly, your manager,

01:20:41.337 --> 01:20:43.571
the guy who is footing the bill

01:20:43.573 --> 01:20:45.406
for all of this, he's Jewish.

01:20:45.408 --> 01:20:47.741
Me, your producer, I'm Jewish.

01:20:47.743 --> 01:20:49.210
And the guy who
owns this studio,

01:20:49.212 --> 01:20:50.644
who is doing us a favor

01:20:50.646 --> 01:20:53.747
by letting us record at
these ridiculous prices,

01:20:53.749 --> 01:20:57.084
he's got numbers
tattooed on his arm.

01:20:57.086 --> 01:20:59.820
Do you know what that means?

01:20:59.822 --> 01:21:01.121
Not really.

01:21:01.123 --> 01:21:03.224
Auschwitz!

01:21:03.226 --> 01:21:06.193
Hitler!
Nazis!

01:21:06.195 --> 01:21:09.864
Now get rid of
the fucking swastikas!

01:21:09.866 --> 01:21:11.465
Okay, fucking lighten up.

01:21:11.467 --> 01:21:14.501
I'll get rid of them.

01:21:14.503 --> 01:21:17.838
Look, you guys,
you're not Nazis, okay?

01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:19.640
You're punks.

01:21:19.642 --> 01:21:22.076
And anything bad,
anything wrong,

01:21:22.078 --> 01:21:25.880
you wanna do it.
I get it.

01:21:25.882 --> 01:21:27.948
Now let's go have a bagel.

01:21:27.950 --> 01:21:30.184
What's a bagel?
What's- what's a bagel?

01:21:30.186 --> 01:21:31.652
What part of Cleveland
are you from?

01:21:31.654 --> 01:21:33.153
Cleveland, Germany?

01:21:33.155 --> 01:21:35.990
[Hilly] What is punk rock?

01:21:35.992 --> 01:21:38.726
Well, call it street music.

01:21:38.728 --> 01:21:42.162
Look, all I care about
is originality.

01:21:42.164 --> 01:21:46.333
These kids have
something to say.

01:21:46.335 --> 01:21:50.404
We really should listen.

01:21:56.945 --> 01:22:01.582
We're the dead boys!

01:22:01.584 --> 01:22:04.184
I- I don't want you

01:22:04.186 --> 01:22:06.854
to hang around

01:22:09.057 --> 01:22:11.592
yeah, I don't need you

01:22:11.594 --> 01:22:15.930
to drag me down

01:22:15.932 --> 01:22:18.866
I- I don't really

01:22:18.868 --> 01:22:23.103
wanna dance

01:22:23.105 --> 01:22:24.905
hello, Poughkeepsie!

01:22:24.907 --> 01:22:29.176
I just wanna
get in your pants

01:22:29.178 --> 01:22:31.845
What's up, Cleveland?

01:22:36.351 --> 01:22:37.851
Fuck you, new haven!

01:22:37.853 --> 01:22:39.153
Fuck off, Boston!

01:22:39.155 --> 01:22:40.854
Suck my balls, bridgeport!

01:22:40.856 --> 01:22:42.756
You cry and cry

01:22:42.758 --> 01:22:45.926
you know I'll
prick you in the end

01:22:48.096 --> 01:22:50.497
Ya look at me
that way, bitch

01:22:50.499 --> 01:22:55.135
Your face is gonna
get a punch

01:22:55.137 --> 01:22:56.804
Hello, white plains!

01:23:17.792 --> 01:23:19.760
We're the dead boys!

01:23:34.976 --> 01:23:38.278
I swallowed my gum.

01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:39.813
What the h-

01:23:39.815 --> 01:23:42.416
I mean- what the h-

01:23:42.418 --> 01:23:43.884
do you want a record deal?!

01:23:43.886 --> 01:23:45.719
Said sorry, you know?

01:23:50.158 --> 01:23:52.626
Go!

01:23:54.562 --> 01:23:56.930
Go!

01:24:20.622 --> 01:24:23.123
Have a nice day.

01:24:27.095 --> 01:24:29.096
May I help you?

01:24:35.537 --> 01:24:38.038
Why would you save

01:24:38.040 --> 01:24:41.642
for your dreams?

01:24:41.644 --> 01:24:43.343
Why not live your dreams?

01:24:43.345 --> 01:24:44.745
Absolutely.

01:24:44.747 --> 01:24:47.314
Hilly Kristal.

01:24:47.316 --> 01:24:49.183
How much do I have
in my account?

01:24:52.353 --> 01:24:54.688
$312.17.

01:24:54.690 --> 01:24:58.092
Keep the 17 cents.

01:24:58.094 --> 01:25:02.796
I'll take the rest.

01:25:02.798 --> 01:25:05.032
What are you doing, hilly?

01:25:05.034 --> 01:25:06.667
Were you following me?
Me?

01:25:06.669 --> 01:25:08.302
Follow you, no,
why would I follow you?

01:25:08.304 --> 01:25:10.704
Yes, I'm following you!

01:25:10.706 --> 01:25:12.506
What are you doing?

01:25:12.508 --> 01:25:13.774
Investing.

01:25:13.776 --> 01:25:17.511
In what?
Treasury bills?

01:25:17.513 --> 01:25:19.546
I'm taking the money
out of the CBGB account

01:25:19.548 --> 01:25:21.582
to float the dead boys
development fund.

01:25:21.584 --> 01:25:23.283
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

01:25:23.285 --> 01:25:24.718
You can't.
You watch me.

01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:26.720
We got bills to pay!

01:25:26.722 --> 01:25:29.156
You have no vision, Merv.

01:25:29.158 --> 01:25:30.591
Well, I quit!

01:25:30.593 --> 01:25:32.559
I'll call you later!
I won't answer!

01:25:32.561 --> 01:25:34.795
Oh, yes you will!
No, I won't!

01:25:56.518 --> 01:25:58.652
I went to a pawnshop.

01:26:03.725 --> 01:26:06.293
Sold everything.

01:26:08.129 --> 01:26:10.764
My father's watch.

01:26:14.903 --> 01:26:16.670
They destroyed your truck.

01:26:16.672 --> 01:26:18.005
And their equipment.

01:26:18.007 --> 01:26:20.207
They're gonna need equipment.

01:26:26.748 --> 01:26:29.283
Why are you doing this?
I believe in them.

01:26:34.222 --> 01:26:36.823
Hey.

01:26:36.825 --> 01:26:38.525
Thank you.

01:26:38.527 --> 01:26:41.361
Why are you thanking me?

01:26:41.363 --> 01:26:44.965
Somebody should.

01:26:49.837 --> 01:26:53.040
This is not the end
of the world.

01:26:53.042 --> 01:26:56.076
I mean, this could be good
for us if we manage it right.

01:26:56.078 --> 01:26:58.879
We are punks, after all.

01:26:58.881 --> 01:27:00.347
Blitz might be dead.

01:27:00.349 --> 01:27:02.816
The last thing I care about
is publicity for a band

01:27:02.818 --> 01:27:05.352
who's about to cost me my club.

01:27:13.661 --> 01:27:15.362
How is he?

01:27:15.364 --> 01:27:19.099
He's, um- he's critical.

01:27:19.101 --> 01:27:20.968
Fuck.

01:27:26.641 --> 01:27:30.644
Do you still have the money?

01:27:30.646 --> 01:27:32.946
Yeah.

01:27:32.948 --> 01:27:34.348
Blitz is gonna need it.

01:27:34.350 --> 01:27:37.084
Make sure he gets
good medical care.

01:27:37.086 --> 01:27:38.385
Where you going?

01:27:38.387 --> 01:27:41.288
I'm not your father!

01:27:41.290 --> 01:27:43.757
I'm just your manager.

01:27:45.593 --> 01:27:48.595
I can't do this anymore.

01:28:25.700 --> 01:28:28.902
he ain't got nothin' at all

01:28:33.041 --> 01:28:37.611
Not the shirt

He ain't got nothin' at all

01:28:45.053 --> 01:28:49.656
And say a word
for ginger brown

01:28:52.193 --> 01:28:56.897
Walks with his head down
to the ground

01:28:58.566 --> 01:29:00.400
Took the shoes

01:29:00.402 --> 01:29:04.371
right off his feet

01:29:04.373 --> 01:29:07.708
threw the poor boy
right out in the street

01:29:07.710 --> 01:29:11.111
And this is what he said

01:29:11.113 --> 01:29:13.980
oh sweet nothing...

01:29:13.982 --> 01:29:17.384
Can I help you?

01:29:17.386 --> 01:29:20.053
I'm sorry.

01:29:32.835 --> 01:29:36.370
Are you the kid that started
that rock 'n roll club?

01:29:36.372 --> 01:29:38.839
Unfortunately, that's me.

01:29:38.841 --> 01:29:41.475
My nephew's band
played there once.

01:29:41.477 --> 01:29:45.278
Teenage Jesus and the jerks.

01:29:48.015 --> 01:29:50.417
Coffee's inside, come on.

01:29:55.223 --> 01:29:57.591
I saw a little bird

01:29:57.593 --> 01:29:59.793
sitting in a tree

01:29:59.795 --> 01:30:03.430
who wanted
to start a family

01:30:03.432 --> 01:30:07.534
He went tweet,

01:30:07.536 --> 01:30:12.038
He were looking for a she

01:30:12.040 --> 01:30:16.243
He couldn't wait
to find a mate

01:30:16.245 --> 01:30:19.579
Sat in a tree
and sang a plea

01:30:19.581 --> 01:30:23.517
He went tweet,

I can't even pay the rent.

01:30:40.135 --> 01:30:41.802
Yeah, you can.

01:30:41.804 --> 01:30:44.504
And yes, you will.

01:30:44.506 --> 01:30:47.307
Look, you may be a lousy
businessman, dad,

01:30:47.309 --> 01:30:49.976
but, damn it, you are

01:30:52.181 --> 01:30:54.514

I just don't get it.

01:31:37.960 --> 01:31:42.128
Why did you risk everything
on the dead boys?

01:31:42.130 --> 01:31:45.932
Was it the auto-asphyxiation
or the self-mutilation?

01:31:47.168 --> 01:31:48.835
They could've been
a bellwether.

01:31:48.837 --> 01:31:51.438

01:37:09.491 --> 01:37:11.357
a couple of visas

01:37:11.359 --> 01:37:14.761
you don't even
know my real name

01:37:14.763 --> 01:37:16.763
High on a hillside

01:37:16.765 --> 01:37:18.598
the trucks are loading

01:37:18.600 --> 01:37:22.001
everything's ready to roll

01:37:22.003 --> 01:37:23.469
I sleep in the daytime

01:37:23.471 --> 01:37:25.972
I work in the nighttime

01:37:25.974 --> 01:37:29.542
I might not ever get home

01:37:29.544 --> 01:37:31.311
this ain't no party

01:37:31.313 --> 01:37:33.112
this ain't no disco

01:37:33.114 --> 01:37:36.649
this ain't
no fooling around

01:37:36.651 --> 01:37:38.484
This ain't no mudd club

01:37:38.486 --> 01:37:40.420
or CBGB

01:37:40.422 --> 01:37:43.857
I ain't got time
for that now

01:37:55.035 --> 01:37:58.037
Talking heads,
get the hell up here please.

01:38:05.079 --> 01:38:09.749
We wanna start
by thanking hilly Kristal.

01:38:09.751 --> 01:38:12.151
We'd to invite hilly up here.

01:38:12.153 --> 01:38:14.487
Hilly is the reason
that we're here,

01:38:14.489 --> 01:38:15.755
that the Ramones are here,

01:38:15.757 --> 01:38:17.123
that blondie are here.

01:38:17.125 --> 01:38:20.994
He kept us alive.

01:38:20.996 --> 01:38:23.396
He fed us and he supported us

01:38:23.398 --> 01:38:26.132
in every way possible.

01:38:26.134 --> 01:38:30.336
He told us we needed
to expand our sound,

01:38:30.338 --> 01:38:33.506
and he taught us
a lot about ethics,

01:38:33.508 --> 01:38:35.341
about how to treat people.

01:38:35.343 --> 01:38:37.243
I'd like to thank hilly again.

01:38:37.245 --> 01:38:38.478
When we were starting out,

01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:39.746
there really weren't clubs

01:38:39.748 --> 01:38:42.382
where bands could play
their own material,

01:38:42.384 --> 01:38:44.584
and, uh, poor hilly wanted

01:38:44.586 --> 01:38:47.220
to have a bluegrass bar
on the bowery,

01:38:47.222 --> 01:38:49.656
and to have some
other music as well.

01:38:49.658 --> 01:38:53.059
I guess the road
didn't go that way.

01:38:53.061 --> 01:38:54.627
The road took another turn.

01:38:54.629 --> 01:38:57.764
And, uh, thanks to-

01:38:57.766 --> 01:39:00.533
I mean, we thank him,

01:39:00.535 --> 01:39:02.769
because he went that
direction and didn't mind.

01:39:02.771 --> 01:39:04.404
It was just extraordinary,

01:39:04.406 --> 01:39:07.106
the fact that bands
came out of the woodwork.

01:39:07.108 --> 01:39:08.942
They were everywhere.

01:39:08.944 --> 01:39:10.276
They were coming
from out of state.

01:39:10.278 --> 01:39:12.078
Nobody knew they were there.

01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:14.280
They came out because
there was somewhere to play.

01:39:14.282 --> 01:39:17.517
Hilly brought the music
into existence in many ways.

01:39:17.519 --> 01:39:21.220
[Applause]

01:40:26.587 --> 01:40:28.721
I saw a little bird

01:40:28.723 --> 01:40:30.757
sittin' in a tree

01:40:30.759 --> 01:40:33.893
who wanted to start
a family

01:40:33.895 --> 01:40:36.896
Who went tweet, tweet

01:40:36.898 --> 01:40:38.264
tweet, tweet

01:40:38.266 --> 01:40:41.968
he went lookin' for a she

01:40:41.970 --> 01:40:46.305
He couldn't wait
to find a mate

01:40:46.307 --> 01:40:49.542
Sat in a tree
and sang a plea

01:40:49.544 --> 01:40:51.978
He went tweet, tweet

01:40:51.980 --> 01:40:53.346
tweet, tweet

01:40:53.348 --> 01:40:56.516
he went looking for a she

01:40:56.518 --> 01:40:58.484
There was a little bee

01:40:58.486 --> 01:41:00.286
a- feelin' mighty free

01:41:00.288 --> 01:41:03.723
some honey, he said
is good for me

01:41:03.725 --> 01:41:06.492
He went a-buzz, buzz

01:41:06.494 --> 01:41:07.794
a- buzz, buzz

01:41:07.796 --> 01:41:11.130
he went looking for a she

01:41:11.132 --> 01:41:14.734
you love me, I love you

01:41:14.736 --> 01:41:18.704
Let's both do
what the birds and bees do

01:41:18.706 --> 01:41:20.440
Buzz, buzz, buzz

01:41:20.442 --> 01:41:21.974
tweet, tweet, tweet

01:41:21.976 --> 01:41:24.544
that means I love you,
love you, love you

01:41:24.546 --> 01:41:28.281
I love you all the time

01:41:34.121 --> 01:41:37.623
isn't it a pity
that the lady from the city

01:41:37.625 --> 01:41:41.160
Went inside a pen
and was taken for a hen

01:41:41.162 --> 01:41:43.529
Turned her back
on a rooster

01:41:43.531 --> 01:41:45.331
And when he promptly
goosed her

01:41:45.333 --> 01:41:47.266
She received such
a bruise to her

01:41:47.268 --> 01:41:49.135
More than she was used to

01:41:49.137 --> 01:41:51.170
that she went back
to the city

01:41:51.172 --> 01:41:52.972
And never came here again

01:41:52.974 --> 01:41:55.141
isn't that a pity

01:41:55.143 --> 01:41:56.642
isn't that a pity

01:41:56.644 --> 01:41:59.245
that means I love you,
love you, love you

01:41:59.247 --> 01:42:04.250
I love you all the time

01:42:04.252 --> 01:42:07.587
that means I love you,
love you, love you, love you

01:42:07.589 --> 01:42:11.991
All the time

01:42:11.993 --> 01:42:14.827
that means I love you,
love you, love you

01:42:14.829 --> 01:42:19.532
I love you all the time

01:42:20.305 --> 01:42:26.547
