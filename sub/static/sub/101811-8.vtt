00:05.135 --> 00:08.921
BAEZ:
For once, can we get a homicide
in a warm, five-star hotel?

00:08.965 --> 00:10.880
Yeah, remind me to
put in a request.

00:10.923 --> 00:12.795
What is Nassau County
doing here?

00:12.838 --> 00:15.885
Don't know. My guess, probably
trying to poach our case.

00:15.928 --> 00:18.366
Detective Raines.
Long time no see.

00:18.409 --> 00:19.671
What are you doing out here?

00:19.715 --> 00:21.891
Same as you, responding
to a homicide call.

00:21.934 --> 00:23.501
This is Nassau County's case.

00:23.545 --> 00:27.027
On the radio it sounded like
NYPD was fishing the body out.

00:27.070 --> 00:29.072
Yeah, because it was tangled up
in the rocks over there.

00:29.116 --> 00:31.248
Over there, which
is Queens County.

00:31.292 --> 00:32.815
Which is New York City.

00:32.858 --> 00:34.556
Which is our jurisdiction.

00:34.599 --> 00:35.513
No way.

00:35.557 --> 00:37.254
And it's the same M.O.

00:37.298 --> 00:38.516
as our serial killer.

00:38.560 --> 00:39.604
I'll notify the M.E.'s office.

00:39.648 --> 00:40.823
You are not taking this case.

00:40.866 --> 00:42.999
How many victims
he kill out here?

00:43.043 --> 00:44.653
Including this, four.
And that includes

00:44.696 --> 00:46.089
a Nassau County detective.

00:46.133 --> 00:47.482
Yeah, and you
don't have squat.

00:47.525 --> 00:49.092
And what do you have on him,

00:49.136 --> 00:50.702
besides that he trapped
the two of you in a basement?

00:50.746 --> 00:52.052
[chuckles]

00:52.878 --> 00:54.184
Word travels fast.

00:54.228 --> 00:57.709
Okay, to be fair,
we don't have squat, either.

00:59.102 --> 01:02.932
Which is why I was gonna suggest
that we work it together.

01:04.412 --> 01:06.370
A joint investigation?

01:06.414 --> 01:07.719
That's right.

01:12.811 --> 01:14.335
Why'd you do that?

01:15.466 --> 01:18.078
You always tell me you don't
want me to steamroll people.

01:20.167 --> 01:24.345
Well, this was the one time
that I wanted you to.

01:27.652 --> 01:29.001
TORY:
Okay, my turn.

01:29.045 --> 01:31.003
Backstreet Boys or NSYNC?

01:31.047 --> 01:32.135
That's your big question?

01:32.179 --> 01:33.876
It can make or break
a relationship.

01:33.919 --> 01:35.921
I didn't take youas a secret pop fan.[laughs]

01:35.965 --> 01:38.141
It ain't a secret.
I performed one of their songs

01:38.185 --> 01:40.578
in my eighth-grade
talent show. Oh!

01:40.622 --> 01:42.580
Ooh.

01:42.624 --> 01:43.929
[laughs]

01:43.973 --> 01:45.366
Oh, I see what you're doing.

01:45.409 --> 01:49.196
Trying to distract me so
you don't have to choose.

01:49.239 --> 01:51.763
But you do. It's the end of
the world and only one group

01:51.807 --> 01:52.938
makes it to the new planet.

01:52.982 --> 01:56.028
Answer in three, two, one.

01:56.072 --> 01:57.987
[gunfire]

02:00.903 --> 02:03.123
[tires screeching]

02:05.125 --> 02:06.343
Tory...

02:06.387 --> 02:08.258
Please help!

02:08.302 --> 02:10.608
[crying]

02:10.652 --> 02:12.175
Please don't...

JANKO:
Hey, give it up!

02:27.495 --> 02:28.887
You're not getting out of here!

02:28.931 --> 02:30.715
Ma'am, step outside.
This is a crime scene.

02:30.759 --> 02:33.805
I'm a reporter.I don't care who you
are. Outside, now.

02:33.849 --> 02:36.025
Hey! [grunts]

02:36.068 --> 02:37.635
Stop!

02:37.679 --> 02:38.854
Don't move.

02:38.897 --> 02:40.203
Hands behind your back.

02:40.247 --> 02:41.335
Too tight.

02:41.378 --> 02:42.640
You're making it tighter
when you resist.

02:42.684 --> 02:44.207
MAN: Get off me.You're under arrest

02:44.251 --> 02:47.079

possession of stolen property.

02:47.123 --> 02:48.385
Get off me! You pigs suck!

02:48.429 --> 02:50.170
Do you really need
to hold him down like that?

02:50.213 --> 02:52.084
I'm not gonna tell you
again. Step outside.

02:52.128 --> 02:54.174
This is a crime scene.
Do not touch anything.

02:54.217 --> 02:56.132
As you can see,
there was barely any damage

02:56.176 --> 02:57.612
done to the store, these
kids are just trying...

02:57.655 --> 02:58.700
Miss.

02:58.743 --> 03:00.310
Hands behind your back.
No.

03:00.354 --> 03:01.659
You're under arrest
for obstruction

03:01.703 --> 03:02.747
of governmental administration

03:02.791 --> 03:03.879
and criminal trespassing.

03:03.922 --> 03:05.185
You can't arrest me.

03:05.228 --> 03:07.448
Yeah? Watch me.[handcuffs clicking]

03:13.367 --> 03:14.716
Oh. Hi.

03:14.759 --> 03:16.674
I'm shadowing my
A.D.A.s and you're up.

03:16.718 --> 03:19.634
Okay. Keisha, this is...

03:19.677 --> 03:21.201
I introduced myself.

03:22.245 --> 03:23.725
Great.

03:26.031 --> 03:28.643
Keisha, before we go over
the statement you gave

03:28.686 --> 03:31.602
to detectives, I'll need you
to change out of that jacket.

03:31.646 --> 03:33.125
My jacket?

03:33.169 --> 03:35.084
I need to voucher
it for evidence.

03:35.911 --> 03:37.434
Will I get it back?

03:37.478 --> 03:38.870
Eventually.

03:40.002 --> 03:43.962
Tory gave it to me,
for my birthday.

03:46.835 --> 03:48.271
And giving it to me will help

03:48.315 --> 03:50.404
put away the person
who did this.

03:54.059 --> 03:56.323
And so will going
over the statement with us.

03:56.366 --> 03:59.978
The more detailed you are,
the better.

04:01.371 --> 04:05.114
Now, you told detectives
that Malik was the shooter.

04:05.941 --> 04:07.072
Yeah.Are you willing

04:07.116 --> 04:09.205
to identify him
if this goes to trial?

04:10.293 --> 04:11.468
Trial?

04:11.512 --> 04:13.427
I will work with you
when the time comes,

04:13.470 --> 04:14.689
to make sure you're prepared.

04:14.732 --> 04:16.778
But you'll have
to point him out.

04:16.821 --> 04:21.304
You mean, he'll be
sitting there, in the same room?

04:21.348 --> 04:22.914
That's how this works.

04:26.875 --> 04:29.051
But he can't hurt you.

04:30.313 --> 04:31.662
[exhales]

04:35.449 --> 04:37.059
And there's
a possibility

04:37.102 --> 04:38.974
that this will
never go to trial.

04:42.586 --> 04:44.675
I didn't see anything.

04:44.719 --> 04:46.329
What do you mean?

04:46.373 --> 04:47.548
I made a mistake.

04:47.591 --> 04:48.505
Keisha.

04:48.549 --> 04:49.637
No.

04:49.680 --> 04:51.552
I didn't see who killed Tory.

04:53.815 --> 04:55.947
[door opens]

04:55.991 --> 04:57.949
When you said "shadowing,"

04:57.993 --> 05:00.343
I assumed that you would be
observing, not leading.

05:00.387 --> 05:02.258
You think I'm the reason
Keisha changed her mind.

05:02.302 --> 05:05.609
All I know is I had a witness
until you just scared her off.

05:05.653 --> 05:07.045
Was I supposed to lie?

05:07.089 --> 05:08.612
It would've been nice to
be mindful of the fact

05:08.656 --> 05:11.398
that she just saw her boyfriend
murdered in front of her.

05:11.441 --> 05:14.488
And protecting her
from reality is being mindful?

05:14.531 --> 05:17.621
There may not even be a
trial if Malik takes a plea.

05:17.665 --> 05:20.885
People are entitled to know
what they're facing, head-on.

05:20.929 --> 05:23.627
And I don't think that this
was the time for that.

05:23.671 --> 05:24.846
When's a good time?

05:25.977 --> 05:27.849
When she's about to get
on the witness stand?

05:27.892 --> 05:29.981
I need Keisha to win this case.

05:30.025 --> 05:32.114
How do you plan
to change her mind?

05:35.422 --> 05:37.032
I will go talk to her.

05:37.075 --> 05:39.251
We'll both go talk to her.

05:40.252 --> 05:41.906
Great.

05:51.655 --> 05:54.049
Robert Lewis is here.

05:54.092 --> 05:55.485
He's late.

05:55.529 --> 05:58.358
How about I keep him waiting
just for the hell of it?

06:01.622 --> 06:04.625
Nah. Let's have him.

06:08.977 --> 06:11.632
[stammers]Arresting a reporter? Really?

06:12.894 --> 06:15.244
And nice to see you, too,
Mr. Attorney General.

06:15.287 --> 06:16.637
Have a seat.

06:19.509 --> 06:20.771
You've seen the footage?

06:20.815 --> 06:22.164
Of course I have.

06:22.207 --> 06:24.384
One million views and counting,

06:24.427 --> 06:28.213
of the NYPD trampling
First Amendment rights.

06:28.257 --> 06:31.521
It was a legitimate arrest,
Robert.

06:31.565 --> 06:33.784
She interfered
with an investigation.

06:33.828 --> 06:36.744
She was doing her job,
reporting on a breaking story.

06:36.787 --> 06:39.355
She became the story.
There's a difference.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.401
I don't care how you want
to frame this,

06:41.444 --> 06:43.707
the press has a right
to report stories

06:43.751 --> 06:46.449
that affect the citizens
of this city.

06:47.407 --> 06:50.453
"Press" is kind of
a loose term here.

06:50.497 --> 06:54.239
She's a self-appointed reporter
with a YouTube channel.

06:55.719 --> 06:57.460
I'd like you to void the arrest.

06:57.504 --> 07:00.245
All you have to say is,
"Upon further investigation,

07:00.289 --> 07:02.987
it was determined
no crime was committed."

07:03.031 --> 07:04.641
She committed two crimes.

07:04.685 --> 07:07.252
Obstruction
of governmental administration

07:07.296 --> 07:08.993
and criminal trespass.

07:09.037 --> 07:11.039
In this climate?
Are you serious?

07:11.082 --> 07:12.606
Oh, please don't
give me "climate."

07:12.649 --> 07:14.172
My job is not weather-dependent.

07:14.216 --> 07:16.348
She's a reporter
with First Amendment rights.

07:16.392 --> 07:18.394
Which do not extend
within a crime scene.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.831
She's claiming she's being
discriminated against

07:20.875 --> 07:23.268
because her pieces
question the NYPD.

07:23.312 --> 07:26.663
They don't question the NYPD,
they condemn it.

07:26.707 --> 07:28.491
But that has no bearing on this.

07:28.535 --> 07:31.451
It has every bearing on this.
Have you looked around?

07:31.494 --> 07:35.063
Your department isn't winning
any popularity contests.

07:35.846 --> 07:38.066
We're not entered in one.

07:43.985 --> 07:46.378
Look, Frank,
I came here as a courtesy.

07:46.422 --> 07:50.034
I could've went straight to
the mayor or the D.A.'s office.

07:51.645 --> 07:55.083
Well, they're both
in walking distance.

07:55.126 --> 07:56.606
And there's the door.

07:59.043 --> 08:01.263
How blind can you be?

08:07.922 --> 08:11.229
â™ª

08:30.205 --> 08:31.206
You ready to go?

08:31.249 --> 08:31.859
Yeah.

08:31.902 --> 08:33.643
Hey. Excuse me.

08:33.687 --> 08:35.297
Hey. We gotta talk.

08:35.340 --> 08:36.341
Now is not a good time.

08:36.385 --> 08:37.604
It'll take one second.

08:38.605 --> 08:41.303
You know Kimberly Crawford,
my new boss?

08:42.522 --> 08:44.567
Detective Reagan,
I've heard a lot about you.

08:44.611 --> 08:46.351
Heard I play nice, hopefully.

08:46.395 --> 08:48.179
Quite the opposite.

08:49.137 --> 08:51.879
Well, ironically,
that's why I'm here.

08:51.922 --> 08:53.184
I got a case...

08:53.228 --> 08:54.534
We're on our way out.

08:54.577 --> 08:56.623
I'd love to hear
about your case.

08:56.666 --> 08:57.711
Thank you.

08:59.234 --> 09:01.192
Our serial killer struck again.

09:01.236 --> 09:03.455
I suggested
a joint investigation

09:03.499 --> 09:05.675
with Detective Raines
in Nassau County.

09:05.719 --> 09:07.285
You suggested?

09:07.329 --> 09:09.070
I guess you can play nice.

09:09.940 --> 09:11.202
And what do you want from me?

09:11.246 --> 09:13.030
It would make things go
a lot faster

09:13.074 --> 09:15.685
if you could assign an A.D.A.
to consolidate the cases.

09:15.729 --> 09:17.208
ERIN: Okay, well,
I can do that,

09:17.252 --> 09:18.862
but as you know,

09:18.906 --> 09:21.691
each county will prosecute
their own murders.

09:21.735 --> 09:22.910
Yeah. Of course.

09:22.953 --> 09:24.346
That's it?

09:25.042 --> 09:26.566
That's all.

09:26.609 --> 09:28.002
Great.

09:28.045 --> 09:29.351
Thank you.

09:33.094 --> 09:34.922
"And effective
2400 hours on this date,

09:34.965 --> 09:37.620
"the responsibility of
issuing New York City

09:37.664 --> 09:40.971
"press passes willno longer be undertaken

09:41.015 --> 09:42.364
"by the NYPD.

09:42.407 --> 09:44.714
"Going forward,
all press passes

09:44.758 --> 09:47.282
will be issued by
the mayor's office."

09:47.325 --> 09:49.066
They screwed us
by e-mail.

09:49.110 --> 09:50.502
And they didn't evenbuy us a drink first.

09:50.546 --> 09:52.722
This is all because of
that so-called reporter?

09:52.766 --> 09:55.420
Baker, get the mayor
on the phone, please.

09:55.464 --> 09:58.380
They realize one of these
reporters are gonna get hurt?

09:58.423 --> 09:59.642
They're picking a fight.

09:59.686 --> 10:01.165
I'm sure they're aware
of the risks.

10:01.209 --> 10:03.167
Whose side are you on?The side of logic?

10:03.211 --> 10:05.430
One of these reporters
gets hurt, the cops get blamed.

10:05.474 --> 10:08.390
Then let's make sure
no one gets hurt, Sid.

10:08.433 --> 10:10.087
Come on, boss,
you know how hard it is

10:10.131 --> 10:11.741
rolling up on
a crime in progress.

10:11.785 --> 10:14.091
Now we got to worryabout a reporter popping up

10:14.135 --> 10:15.266
out of nowhere?

10:15.310 --> 10:16.703
Then we deal.

10:16.746 --> 10:17.878
That's what we do.

10:17.921 --> 10:19.662
Like we don't have enough
to deal with?

10:20.968 --> 10:22.360
The mayor is unavailable.

10:22.404 --> 10:25.276
Apparently, he has
"a very full schedule."

10:25.320 --> 10:27.017
[sighs]

10:27.061 --> 10:29.454
What's the other shoe?

10:30.325 --> 10:32.109
His assistant suggested

10:32.153 --> 10:34.677
that if you have questions
about the press passes,

10:34.721 --> 10:38.289
you should talk to
the attorney general about it.

10:44.818 --> 10:47.429
[sighs]

10:47.472 --> 10:51.215
Victim is Sophia Vasquez,
24, from Sheepshead Bay.

10:51.259 --> 10:53.522
Apparent suffocation with a bag,

10:53.565 --> 10:55.437
and hands tied behind her back.

10:55.480 --> 10:57.787
Which is his M.O.

10:57.831 --> 10:59.136
Look, I don't get it.

10:59.180 --> 11:00.311
Y-You guys have his house,
you have his mother

11:00.355 --> 11:01.704
murdered in the same manner.

11:01.748 --> 11:03.358
How have we not identified him?

11:04.141 --> 11:05.534
It wasn't his house.

11:05.577 --> 11:06.753
And she wasn't his mother.

11:06.796 --> 11:08.493
I thought he lived there
with his mother.

11:08.537 --> 11:10.800
Well, according to the M.E.,
she never gave birth.

11:10.844 --> 11:12.846
So, what do you have
on this guy?

11:13.803 --> 11:16.850
We have a description of the guyfrom the two officers

11:16.893 --> 11:18.590
who came to get us
from the basement.

11:18.634 --> 11:20.331
Oh, come on, there were
no prints in the house?

11:20.375 --> 11:21.942
There were prints in the house,
and we got them,

11:21.985 --> 11:23.508
but they don't match anyone
in the system.

11:23.552 --> 11:24.858
So the question is,

11:24.901 --> 11:26.424
how has he been able to float
under the radar?

11:26.468 --> 11:27.991
Obviously, this guy's good
at what he does.

11:28.035 --> 11:29.732
I mean, obviously.
He was able to trap

11:29.776 --> 11:31.560
two New York City detectives
in a basement, right?

11:32.648 --> 11:34.519
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

11:34.563 --> 11:35.782
That's the second time
you brought it up.

11:35.825 --> 11:36.957
What's your problem?

11:37.000 --> 11:38.349
I'm just saying,
he knows what he's doing.

11:38.393 --> 11:39.611
Oh, which implies we don't?Look,

11:39.655 --> 11:40.917
the guy threw you
down a flight of stairs.

11:40.961 --> 11:42.005
I get that this is personal.

11:42.049 --> 11:43.528
I am not working with this guy.

11:43.572 --> 11:45.008
Okay. All right, stop.
All right?

11:45.052 --> 11:47.358
We need to find a commondenominator between the victims.

11:47.402 --> 11:48.664
How did he meet them?

11:49.709 --> 11:52.015
The social media unit is
going over

11:52.059 --> 11:53.843
the vics' phones and computers.DANNY: Great.

11:53.887 --> 11:57.412
In the meantime, Sophia
Vasquez's autopsy just came in.

11:58.892 --> 12:00.371
You know, to be honest,

12:00.415 --> 12:01.764
it only takes two of us

12:01.808 --> 12:03.461
to go to the
M.E.'s office.

12:03.505 --> 12:05.507
Okay. I'll work on
what the vics have in common.

12:05.550 --> 12:07.509
Great.Text us, Sherlock,

12:07.552 --> 12:08.989
when you solve the case.

12:13.994 --> 12:15.386
Hey, Lou. Did you log

12:15.430 --> 12:16.823
that reporter's phoneas evidence yet?

12:16.866 --> 12:18.389
I want to put in a searchwarrant application for it.

12:18.433 --> 12:19.956
I just got off the
phone with the chief.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.045
The D.A.'s office isdeclining to prosecute.

12:22.089 --> 12:23.568
Are you kidding me?Nope.

12:23.612 --> 12:26.267
We had to return the phoneand cut her loose.

12:29.096 --> 12:30.662
[phone ringing]

12:31.925 --> 12:33.100
Hello?

12:33.143 --> 12:34.754
Erin, what the hell's going on?

12:34.797 --> 12:36.407
Can't talk right now.JAMIE: I arrest a reporter

12:36.451 --> 12:37.800
for trespassing and obstruction

12:37.844 --> 12:39.280
and you guys won't prosecute?

12:39.323 --> 12:40.281
What the hell is that?

12:40.324 --> 12:42.152
I will call you back.

12:42.196 --> 12:43.937
JAMIE:
It was a good arrest, Erin...

12:45.460 --> 12:46.417
Damn it.

12:46.461 --> 12:47.723
[elevator bell dings]

12:51.248 --> 12:53.511
Let me guess, that was
your brother calling?

12:53.555 --> 12:55.731
The one who arrested
the reporter.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.385
Yes, it was.

12:57.428 --> 12:59.604
Tell him that if he has
questions about it,

12:59.648 --> 13:01.041
he should call me.

13:01.084 --> 13:02.738
Great.

13:04.522 --> 13:06.350
They all have damaged larynx,

13:06.394 --> 13:09.440
consistent with being
in a choke hold

13:09.484 --> 13:11.051
before they're
smothered.

13:11.094 --> 13:12.313
Okay, hold on.

13:12.356 --> 13:14.445
So, he comes from behind them
and chokes them

13:14.489 --> 13:15.795
before he uses the bag?

13:15.838 --> 13:17.971
Until they are semiconscious.

13:18.014 --> 13:19.973
And then he uses the bag
to cut off air.

13:20.016 --> 13:21.757
Judging by the
defense wounds,

13:21.801 --> 13:25.282
they try to fight him off
as he chokes them to death.

13:25.326 --> 13:26.544
Slowly.

13:26.588 --> 13:29.460
And he uses the see-through bags

13:29.504 --> 13:30.984
so he can watch them die.

13:31.854 --> 13:34.509
Were you able to get
any of his DNA?

13:34.552 --> 13:36.076
I have a semen sample.

13:36.119 --> 13:37.512
He had sex with her?

13:37.555 --> 13:39.644
It looks
like it, yes.

13:39.688 --> 13:41.429
Well, that's consistent
with his M.O.

13:41.472 --> 13:42.473
on the other
three victims.

13:42.517 --> 13:43.648
Ten victims.

13:43.692 --> 13:45.215
What?

13:45.259 --> 13:46.521
What are you talking about?

13:46.564 --> 13:47.609
I ran his DNA

13:47.652 --> 13:50.568
through the federal database.

13:50.612 --> 13:52.657
He's killed
at least six other women

13:52.701 --> 13:53.920
across the U.S.

13:53.963 --> 13:55.965
Six more women. Are you sure?

13:56.009 --> 13:56.879
DNA doesn't lie.

13:56.923 --> 13:57.967
BAEZ:
And no one

13:58.011 --> 14:00.361
has picked up on this until now?

14:00.404 --> 14:02.667
Because the victims
are runaways, sex workers...

14:02.711 --> 14:05.148
People nobody would bother
to investigate.

14:05.192 --> 14:08.108
Which is why these are the cases
that bother me the most.

14:08.151 --> 14:11.154
There's no... motive,
no opportunity.

14:11.198 --> 14:13.548
No. Just evil.

14:19.684 --> 14:20.903
Thanks.

14:20.947 --> 14:23.384
We need Keisha to go over
the statement

14:23.427 --> 14:24.907
that she gave to
the detectives.

14:24.951 --> 14:26.735
We could've saved you
the trip.

14:26.778 --> 14:28.693
Keisha already told you
everything.

14:28.737 --> 14:29.869
She recanted.

14:29.912 --> 14:31.740
She came to her senses.

14:31.783 --> 14:33.916
Keisha, you told
detectives

14:33.960 --> 14:35.222
that Malik was
the shooter

14:35.265 --> 14:36.484
right after it happened.

14:36.527 --> 14:38.355
She was confused.

14:38.399 --> 14:39.400
Traumatized.

14:39.443 --> 14:41.576
Without you, Malik could walk.

14:42.533 --> 14:44.013
No.

14:44.057 --> 14:45.493
You can't let
that happen.

14:45.536 --> 14:47.060
Then you need to speak up.

14:47.103 --> 14:48.322
No.

14:48.365 --> 14:51.412
She didn't see anything.

14:51.455 --> 14:53.022
She saw everything.

14:53.066 --> 14:55.329
She doesn't know what she saw.

14:56.765 --> 14:58.723
Keisha...

14:58.767 --> 15:00.900
you said in your statement

15:00.943 --> 15:02.814
that Tory was your boyfriend.

15:03.946 --> 15:06.731
He was more than a boyfriend.

15:06.775 --> 15:08.951
Tory was like a son to me.

15:08.995 --> 15:10.431
He was like a son to you,

15:10.474 --> 15:12.346
but you're comfortable
letting his killer off the hook?

15:15.436 --> 15:16.567
Mom, please...

15:16.611 --> 15:18.395
Keisha, please.

15:18.439 --> 15:20.745
Refill the kettle for me?

15:23.139 --> 15:24.967
[teapot rattles]

15:27.187 --> 15:29.232
We get what
you're trying to do here.

15:29.276 --> 15:31.408
Do you know what happens
to people who snitch?

15:31.452 --> 15:32.975
They end up dead.

15:33.019 --> 15:35.021
We can protect Keisha
and your family.

15:35.064 --> 15:37.806
Who's going to protect us? Cops?

15:37.849 --> 15:39.416
[laughs] And after the trial?

15:39.460 --> 15:41.766
Who protects us
when Malik and his crew

15:41.810 --> 15:43.159
decide they want revenge on her?

15:43.203 --> 15:46.249
What happens to Keisha
when she doesn't testify?

15:47.076 --> 15:48.382
ERIN:
And what kind of message

15:48.425 --> 15:49.774
are you sending

15:49.818 --> 15:51.646
by telling her
not to speak to us?

15:51.689 --> 15:53.953
The same message
I'm sending you.

15:54.823 --> 15:57.260
I will not let her
end up like him.

16:05.703 --> 16:07.488
Well, what time did you
sign in this morning?

16:07.531 --> 16:08.750
I don't know.

16:08.793 --> 16:10.839
I'm guessing
around 5:00 a.m.

16:10.882 --> 16:12.232
'Cause you
couldn't sleep,

16:12.275 --> 16:14.060
'cause you couldn't stop
thinking about the case,

16:14.103 --> 16:16.410
'cause you're kind of
letting it get personal.

16:16.453 --> 16:19.282
Says the guy who lets almost
every case get personal.

16:19.326 --> 16:21.154
Which is why
I'm the perfect person

16:21.197 --> 16:23.547
to warn you that you're treading
into dangerous territory.

16:23.591 --> 16:24.940
You don't understand.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.768
This is the first time
in my adult life

16:26.811 --> 16:28.074
where I was
the victim.

16:28.117 --> 16:29.640
No, I actually
do understand.

16:29.684 --> 16:31.033
And we will get the guy.

16:31.077 --> 16:32.121
As long as you don't do

16:32.165 --> 16:33.949
what you always tell me
not to do,

16:33.993 --> 16:35.603
which is get too emotional
about a case.

16:35.646 --> 16:37.039
[sighs]
Okay?

16:37.083 --> 16:38.301
What do we got so far?

16:38.345 --> 16:41.043
His victims all
responded to ads

16:41.087 --> 16:42.958
on social media
for modeling gigs.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.481
So he's pretending
to be a modeling scout?

16:44.525 --> 16:46.135
He starts with
a direct message,

16:46.179 --> 16:47.832
"I like your pics, have
you ever thought about

16:47.876 --> 16:48.833
being a lingerie model?"

16:48.877 --> 16:49.878
Well, that makes sense.

16:49.921 --> 16:51.140
They're all runaways
who need money.

16:51.184 --> 16:52.837
I guess he figures
there'd be less scrutiny,

16:52.881 --> 16:54.709
no family
searching for them.
Right.

16:55.623 --> 16:57.668
So you guys set up
the phony account?

16:57.712 --> 16:59.279
We made contact
with your target.

16:59.322 --> 17:00.671
Did he take
the bait?

17:00.715 --> 17:02.021
Yeah.

17:02.064 --> 17:03.152
BAEZ: He thinks
he's messaging

17:03.196 --> 17:04.371
a 19-year-old runaway.

17:04.414 --> 17:05.459
Good.

17:05.502 --> 17:06.547
TECH:
He asked for photos.

17:06.590 --> 17:07.591
DANNY:
Did you send 'em?

17:07.635 --> 17:08.549
He wants to set up
a meeting.

17:08.592 --> 17:10.377
Guess he took the bait.

17:10.420 --> 17:11.552
Where?

17:11.595 --> 17:13.684
A bar in Little Neck.
CafÃ© Martello.

17:19.386 --> 17:21.518
They had your favorite...

17:21.562 --> 17:22.954
double chocolate.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.958
These are consolation doughnuts,
aren't they?

17:27.002 --> 17:28.699
I got nothing.Did you check

17:28.743 --> 17:30.092
the security cameras?

17:30.136 --> 17:31.528
Zilch.

17:31.572 --> 17:34.009
Somebody shot out the video
cameras the week before.

17:34.053 --> 17:36.316
I thought I saw a bodegaon the corner.
Erin...

17:36.359 --> 17:37.839
Well, what about
other witnesses?

17:37.882 --> 17:40.102
Eh, look, you know the way
these communities get.

17:40.146 --> 17:41.495
People are afraid to speak up,

17:41.538 --> 17:43.236
they'd rather play deaf.
And sometimes rightfully so.

17:43.279 --> 17:44.280
[knocking on door]

17:44.324 --> 17:45.890
Sorry to interrupt.

17:47.022 --> 17:48.371
Any new leads?

17:48.415 --> 17:50.243
Uh, not yet.

17:50.286 --> 17:52.767
But we're working
on some other angles.

17:54.160 --> 17:55.509
Yeah. Uh...

17:55.552 --> 17:57.859
You know, sometimes
you need to give people space

17:57.902 --> 17:59.382
to change their mind

17:59.426 --> 18:01.776
and decide to do
what's right.

18:02.907 --> 18:04.213
You came up dry.

18:04.257 --> 18:06.955
Well, we have detectives
canvassing as we speak.

18:06.998 --> 18:09.218
Issue a grand jury subpoena
to Keisha.

18:09.262 --> 18:10.393
Already done.

18:10.437 --> 18:13.092
And get her back
into this office.

18:13.135 --> 18:16.095
It's the only way we'll get
a shot at changing her mind.

18:16.138 --> 18:19.794
Or she'll be more determined
not to cooperate.

18:20.969 --> 18:22.623
It's not a suggestion.

18:25.974 --> 18:28.150
â™ª

18:28.194 --> 18:31.110
[sirens wailing]

18:31.153 --> 18:33.329
Please, please!
Just come, he's been shot.

18:33.373 --> 18:34.983
He's not moving.

18:35.026 --> 18:36.245
I don't know
what to do.

18:36.289 --> 18:37.420
What the hell are
you doing here?

18:37.464 --> 18:39.205
Please, just help him!

18:39.248 --> 18:40.815
I-I called 911,

18:40.858 --> 18:42.425
I-I don't know...

18:42.469 --> 18:43.905
I don't know what to do.2-9 sergeant to Central.

18:43.948 --> 18:45.907
We need a bus, this location.
Put a rush on it.

18:47.082 --> 18:49.171
Sir, I'm gonna put
pressure on your wounds.

18:49.215 --> 18:50.346
Help is on the way, okay?

18:50.390 --> 18:52.435
[gasping]Did you see who shot him?

18:52.479 --> 18:54.176
Is he gonna be okay?

18:54.220 --> 18:55.525
Did you see who shot him?

18:58.485 --> 18:59.834
Sir, just stick with me, okay?

19:03.490 --> 19:05.144
He's late.

19:05.187 --> 19:06.493
He's gonna show up.

19:06.536 --> 19:08.451
What makes
you so sure?He needs his fix.

19:08.495 --> 19:10.192
RAINES:
It's been half an hour.

19:10.236 --> 19:11.367
He'll show.

19:11.411 --> 19:12.629
Okay?
Let's give it a minute.

19:12.673 --> 19:15.154
We got someone
approaching the van.

19:15.197 --> 19:16.155
What?

19:16.198 --> 19:17.460
Who is it?

19:19.332 --> 19:20.855
[pounding on van]

19:20.898 --> 19:22.900
Hey. Get rid of him.

19:28.297 --> 19:29.603
Who the hell are you?Some guy gave me

19:29.646 --> 19:31.039
20 bucks to deliver this pizza.

19:31.082 --> 19:32.693
What guy?I don't know.

19:32.736 --> 19:34.825
What'd he look like?I don't know.
Like a regular dude.

19:34.869 --> 19:36.262
You got the sketch?

19:37.959 --> 19:39.569
He look like this?I don't know.

19:39.613 --> 19:40.831
He was wearing a hat.

19:40.875 --> 19:42.181
Where'd he go?

19:42.224 --> 19:44.270
I don't know. He left a note.

19:46.446 --> 19:49.449
"You won't catch me.
Enjoy your night."

19:52.582 --> 19:54.149
[sighs]

19:54.193 --> 19:55.237
[elevator bell dings]

19:55.281 --> 19:57.108
If you decide
to testify again,

19:57.152 --> 19:59.023
the next step would be
going to the grand j...

19:59.067 --> 20:01.374
Oh, my. Mrs. Washington,
I'm so sorry.

20:01.417 --> 20:02.940
I didn't realize Keisha...Keisha, why don't we

20:02.984 --> 20:04.115
go to
my office?Please, Keisha.

20:04.159 --> 20:06.074
Do you know who killed Tory?

20:06.117 --> 20:07.815
Mrs. Washington...

20:07.858 --> 20:09.947
Do you?

20:09.991 --> 20:10.948
You were with him,

20:10.992 --> 20:12.298
you saw...

20:12.341 --> 20:14.256
He would've done
anything for you,

20:14.300 --> 20:15.866
and you're just goingto let his killer go free?Keisha, please.

20:15.910 --> 20:17.346
Let's go to my office.Why, Keisha?!

20:22.830 --> 20:24.135
You did that on purpose.

20:24.179 --> 20:26.137
Excuse me?You orchestrated

20:26.181 --> 20:28.096
the whole thing--
that Tory's mother would

20:28.139 --> 20:29.445
bump right into Keisha.

20:29.489 --> 20:31.099
So what if I did?

20:31.142 --> 20:34.102
What happened to playing
everything by the book?

20:34.145 --> 20:36.800
If Keisha is willing
to let a murderer go free,

20:36.844 --> 20:39.890
she should be forced to look
at the repercussions of that.

20:39.934 --> 20:41.109
I disagree.

20:41.152 --> 20:42.980
Well, I don't look at things

20:43.024 --> 20:44.460
from the Reagan perspective.

20:44.504 --> 20:46.332
And what does that mean?

20:46.375 --> 20:49.248
You and your family know
exactly how the system works

20:49.291 --> 20:51.641
and you use it
in your favor all the time.

20:51.685 --> 20:54.122
And what exactly does
my family have to do

20:54.165 --> 20:55.645
with anything
that just happened?

20:55.689 --> 20:58.169
Your brothers have an E-ZPass
right to your door.

20:58.213 --> 20:59.867
Since when is it wrong

20:59.910 --> 21:01.695
that NYPD officers
and detectives

21:01.738 --> 21:02.826
come up to this floor?

21:02.870 --> 21:04.828
When you consistently intercede

21:04.872 --> 21:06.352
and interfere on their behalf.

21:06.395 --> 21:09.311
All within my legal
and ethical limits.

21:09.355 --> 21:11.182
I didn't say it was illegal.No, but you're implying

21:11.226 --> 21:13.272
that my family is operating

21:13.315 --> 21:15.012
in some sort of corrupt manner.

21:15.056 --> 21:17.406
Not corrupt, just convenient.

21:17.450 --> 21:19.843
Why don't you just say
what you need to say.

21:19.887 --> 21:21.497
Get it off your chest.

21:21.541 --> 21:23.891
I think I just did.

21:31.072 --> 21:32.639
Police Commissioner Reagan.

21:32.682 --> 21:34.945
Thank you.

21:35.729 --> 21:37.948
[sighs]

21:45.652 --> 21:48.089
Boy...

21:48.132 --> 21:51.048
you got your hand on every scale
in town, don't you?

21:51.092 --> 21:52.702
Careful there.

21:52.746 --> 21:54.748
Well, you got the charges
against her dropped.

21:54.791 --> 21:55.879
What would you call it?

21:55.923 --> 21:57.185
I went to you first

21:57.228 --> 21:58.882
and you literally
showed me the door.

21:58.926 --> 22:03.147
So you strong-armed the mayor
into taking away our oversight?

22:03.191 --> 22:05.715
You are wasting a lot
of capital on this.

22:05.759 --> 22:08.718
Not wasting, gladly spending,
which is my prerogative.

22:08.762 --> 22:12.766
When a reporter inserts
herself into a crime scene,

22:12.809 --> 22:14.594
it puts my cops at risk.

22:14.637 --> 22:16.073
Well, maybe you should
look at it

22:16.117 --> 22:17.771
as a way to protect your cops,

22:17.814 --> 22:19.729
if they have nothing to hide.

22:20.513 --> 22:25.387
Your reporter was on the scene
of another looting incident.

22:25.431 --> 22:28.782
The store owner
was shot in the chest.

22:28.825 --> 22:30.697
Did she shoot him?

22:33.134 --> 22:36.093
Then she had every right
to be there.

22:36.137 --> 22:38.095
A piece of advice?

22:38.139 --> 22:40.576
[sighs]

22:40.620 --> 22:42.883
I'm good, thanks.

22:42.926 --> 22:44.972
You and your cops
are under siege

22:45.015 --> 22:47.191
from all sides, I get that.

22:47.235 --> 22:51.108
But the press, they're just
the messenger in this,

22:51.152 --> 22:52.588
and you don't kill
the messenger.

22:52.632 --> 22:55.243
That's exactly what I'm trying
to avoid happening.

22:55.286 --> 22:57.114
So you want the right
to arrest reporters

22:57.158 --> 22:58.159
for their own good?Oh, please.

22:58.202 --> 23:00.901
Well, it walks like a duck.

23:00.944 --> 23:02.598
[chuckles softly]

23:02.642 --> 23:04.295
You know what's missing
in all this,

23:04.339 --> 23:06.602
besides common sense?

23:06.646 --> 23:07.995
The petition.

23:08.038 --> 23:10.476
What petition?
The one where
the major newspapers

23:10.519 --> 23:13.479
and media outlets sign up
a bunch of prominent names

23:13.522 --> 23:15.698
and drop 'em on my doorstep.
That one.

23:15.742 --> 23:17.570
I don't know anything
about a petition.

23:17.613 --> 23:18.788
Yeah, you do.

23:18.832 --> 23:21.487
There is always one
in beefs like this.

23:21.530 --> 23:23.271
Well, you're wrong this time.

23:23.314 --> 23:25.708
Or... I'm right

23:25.752 --> 23:29.146
and they couldn't get
any real reporters to sign it.

23:29.190 --> 23:30.844
Or, wishful thinking.

23:30.887 --> 23:32.454
Maybe.

23:32.498 --> 23:34.064
See, people know there's a risk

23:34.108 --> 23:36.153
in going on record
for the police,

23:36.197 --> 23:39.243
so maybe staying
on the sidelines

23:39.287 --> 23:42.290
is the new sign of support.

23:42.333 --> 23:44.074
And a piece of advice?

23:44.118 --> 23:46.163
I'm good, thanks.

23:46.207 --> 23:48.165
[sighs]

23:48.209 --> 23:51.430
Remind yourself
whose side you're on.

24:02.092 --> 24:03.050
Officer Reagan?

24:03.093 --> 24:04.486
How is the shop owner?

24:04.530 --> 24:06.314
Louis Trattner.

24:06.357 --> 24:08.185
His name's Louis Trattner.

24:08.229 --> 24:10.492
Okay. How is Mr. Trattner?

24:10.536 --> 24:13.364
He's in critical condition,
with a ruptured spleen,

24:13.408 --> 24:15.889
and a bullet lodged
near his vertebrae.

24:18.413 --> 24:20.023
It's not my fault he was shot.

24:20.067 --> 24:21.590
You got there before us again.

24:21.634 --> 24:23.549
Okay, so now I'm at fault
for being resourceful?

24:23.592 --> 24:25.507
Did you get a heads-up that
they were going to hit again?

24:25.551 --> 24:27.378
I don't have
to tell you anything.

24:27.422 --> 24:29.990
Did you get 'em on tape,
with your phone?

24:30.033 --> 24:31.034
Did you get a good look
at any of them?

24:31.078 --> 24:31.905
Know who any of them are?

24:31.948 --> 24:33.776
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

24:33.820 --> 24:35.430
I forgot...

24:35.474 --> 24:37.476
you only help the criminals.

24:37.519 --> 24:39.042
It's not my job
to arrest criminals.

24:39.086 --> 24:40.609
My job is to get stories.

24:40.653 --> 24:42.306
Good to know. I'm glad
Mr. Trattner could provide you

24:42.350 --> 24:44.004
with an exciting story.

24:47.224 --> 24:49.488
I just don't understand
why we can't subpoena her phone.

24:49.531 --> 24:51.141
You can if you have proof

24:51.185 --> 24:53.840
that she taped the shooting
on her phone, which you don't.

24:53.883 --> 24:56.233
And since when are we doing
official police business

24:56.277 --> 24:58.192
at the family dinner?

24:58.235 --> 24:59.236
Like, every week.

24:59.280 --> 25:01.021
We discuss police business,

25:01.064 --> 25:03.502
we do not conduct it--
there's a difference, wise guy.

25:03.545 --> 25:06.200
And I'm with Jamie
on this one.
Me, too.

25:06.243 --> 25:08.071
Well, no one asked you. Or you.

25:08.115 --> 25:09.508
Well.
Okay.

25:09.551 --> 25:11.248
Guess you're not interested
in my opinion.

25:11.292 --> 25:13.599
I'm sure it's the same
as every other cop at
this table, Pop.

25:13.642 --> 25:16.427
I've seen a lot of her
stuff. She really tries to
make you guys look bad.

25:16.471 --> 25:18.560
Tries to or succeeds
at doing so?

25:18.604 --> 25:20.301
Does it matter?Yeah, it matters.

25:20.344 --> 25:22.216
Half the kids at school
think that all cops are bad.

25:22.259 --> 25:24.000
Exactly.That's what happens

25:24.044 --> 25:26.612
when a reporter slants
the story and the listener

25:26.655 --> 25:29.528
can't be bothered
to seek out the other side.

25:29.571 --> 25:30.964
You mean, the other slant?

25:31.007 --> 25:32.531
FRANK:
Yeah, I guess I do.

25:32.574 --> 25:34.837
But look, it takes twice
the time and energy

25:34.881 --> 25:37.579
just to find out
the simple truth.

25:37.623 --> 25:40.234
But my partner got
shero headlines

25:40.277 --> 25:43.193
when she took that guy out
and that was the whole story.

25:43.237 --> 25:45.544
And Joe practically
got the cover of People.

25:45.587 --> 25:46.849
Well, he deserved it.

25:46.893 --> 25:48.155
What else could they
have written

25:48.198 --> 25:49.373
about him after what he did?

25:49.417 --> 25:51.071
Yeah, how could you
put a negative slant

25:51.114 --> 25:52.768
on saving a kid
from a kidnapping?

25:52.812 --> 25:56.555
I'm just saying not all
of our press is bad.

25:56.598 --> 25:58.034
And you're right,
but a Diane Butler

25:58.078 --> 26:00.559
isn't gonna cover Joe's story,
or Witten's story.

26:00.602 --> 26:02.125
It goes against her agenda.

26:02.169 --> 26:04.780
Which is a hundred percentanti-cop.
Exactly.

26:04.824 --> 26:06.652
So what?
I should give you the subpoena

26:06.695 --> 26:08.523
because she's anti-cop?

26:08.567 --> 26:10.481
You do realize
that's against the law.

26:10.525 --> 26:14.398
Maybe we should just go back
to hating lawyers instead.

26:14.442 --> 26:15.748
ERIN:
Thanks, Pop.

26:15.791 --> 26:18.533
I'll have you know,
my boss already hates me

26:18.577 --> 26:21.710
because she thinks I play
favoritism to all of you.

26:21.754 --> 26:23.538
DANNY: Oh.There's a fat chance of that.

26:23.582 --> 26:24.713
Excuse me?

26:24.757 --> 26:26.106
I called you for help
and you blew me off.

26:26.149 --> 26:27.542
The D.A.'s office is not
gonna prosecute a reporter

26:27.586 --> 26:29.979
unless the charges
are egregious.

26:30.023 --> 26:31.633
She touched evidence, Erin.

26:31.677 --> 26:33.722
Not a case I'd like to try
for a first-time offender.

26:33.766 --> 26:38.509
And if the store owner
who was shot was Pop?

26:40.163 --> 26:42.775
So who's slanted now?

26:42.818 --> 26:44.211
I'm just sayin'.

26:44.254 --> 26:46.039
Yeah, that puts it
in perspective.
Yep.

26:46.082 --> 26:48.041
But don't worry, I get it.
I won't come by to hear "no"

26:48.084 --> 26:49.869
from you any time soon.Same here.

26:49.912 --> 26:52.915
Well, great. Then I'll have
time for my own damn cases.

26:52.959 --> 26:54.656
Good.

26:54.700 --> 26:56.092
Then it's settled.

26:56.136 --> 26:57.703
[sighs]

26:57.746 --> 27:00.096
â™ª

27:08.278 --> 27:09.715
Thank you.

27:13.414 --> 27:15.721
If I'm being honest,
Danny and Jamie

27:15.764 --> 27:17.026
are getting all too comfortable

27:17.070 --> 27:19.463
coming up to my office
and demanding favors.

27:19.507 --> 27:20.943
Well, if you're still
being honest,

27:20.987 --> 27:23.424
do you really think you would
skirt the law

27:23.467 --> 27:24.730
to give them what they want?

27:24.773 --> 27:26.949
Never.
Well, there you go.

27:26.993 --> 27:29.169
But my boss
doesn't see it that way.

27:29.212 --> 27:33.782
She thinks that I view all
my cases skewed by my family.

27:33.826 --> 27:35.218
Well, she may be right.

27:35.262 --> 27:36.567
Well, gee, thanks, Dad.

27:36.611 --> 27:38.744
Well, I mean, look.

27:38.787 --> 27:40.354
We're all products
of our environment

27:40.397 --> 27:41.747
to a certain extent.

27:41.790 --> 27:43.879
Ours has always been
one of mutual support.

27:43.923 --> 27:47.187
Well, there is such a thing
as abusing the privilege.

27:48.710 --> 27:49.885
[chuckles softly]

27:49.929 --> 27:51.539
You want me to talk to them?

27:51.582 --> 27:53.019
No.

27:53.062 --> 27:55.674
Take them out to the woodshed?

27:55.717 --> 27:58.024
We don't have a woodshed.

28:01.767 --> 28:04.465
How do you feel
about being overlooked?

28:04.508 --> 28:06.554
I wasn't overlooked.

28:06.597 --> 28:07.947
I wasn't chosen.

28:07.990 --> 28:10.210
There's a lawyered answer.

28:12.778 --> 28:14.475
I don't know.

28:14.518 --> 28:17.608
You know...

28:17.652 --> 28:21.003
she may feel she has
to prove herself to you.

28:21.047 --> 28:23.223
Why would she?

28:23.266 --> 28:28.837
Well, we all walk around
with doubts about ourselves

28:28.881 --> 28:32.754
and in fear
of having them confirmed.

28:32.798 --> 28:34.538
[taps finger on table]

28:34.582 --> 28:37.454
I certainly do.

28:37.498 --> 28:39.805
She probably has hers.

28:41.415 --> 28:44.157
Well, that just sounds like
a fun house mirror

28:44.200 --> 28:46.725
without any fun.

28:55.342 --> 28:57.605
â™ª

29:02.697 --> 29:03.785
Hey.

29:03.829 --> 29:05.134
What're you watching?

29:06.614 --> 29:08.703
You're not gonna like this.

29:12.098 --> 29:14.970
BUTLER:
What began as an attempt
to steal jewelry

29:15.014 --> 29:18.321
ended with gunfire in a high-end Chelsea jewelry store

29:18.365 --> 29:19.453
when the owner was shot.

29:19.496 --> 29:20.584
TRATTNER:
Get out of my store!

29:20.628 --> 29:22.630
I'm gonna call...[gunshots]

29:25.154 --> 29:25.981
Damn it.

29:26.025 --> 29:27.853
She blurred all the faces.

29:27.896 --> 29:30.072
She is the only one
who could've recorded that.

29:30.116 --> 29:31.813
If I could just
search her phone...

29:31.857 --> 29:34.555
Isn't she protected
under the media shield law?

29:34.598 --> 29:36.252
Yeah, but that only extends
to traditional news sources,

29:36.296 --> 29:38.080
not social media outlets,
and definitely not YouTube.

29:38.124 --> 29:40.082
So this isn't
a news interview

29:40.126 --> 29:42.041
so it might not
be protected?

29:42.084 --> 29:44.173
It's a crime
and she's the only witness.

29:44.217 --> 29:45.784
She's never going to cooperate.

29:45.827 --> 29:47.786
If a judge grants
the search warrant,

29:47.829 --> 29:49.352
she won't have to.

29:49.396 --> 29:51.615
Hey, just got to the squad,
you're not here.

29:51.659 --> 29:52.921
Where the hell are you?

29:52.965 --> 29:55.794
Hey. I'm just checking out
an address.

29:55.837 --> 29:56.838
What address?

29:56.882 --> 29:58.013
From TARU's list.

29:58.057 --> 30:00.450
Um, it was a location

30:00.494 --> 30:02.931
that pinged
on Sophia Vasquez's phone.

30:02.975 --> 30:04.454
The address in Gravesend?

30:04.498 --> 30:05.978
Yeah.

30:06.021 --> 30:07.762
Apparently it also pinged
on Madeline Gleason's phone

30:07.806 --> 30:09.285
before she disappeared, too.

30:09.329 --> 30:11.897
The question is, why the hell
didn't you wait for me

30:11.940 --> 30:13.246
or Detective Raines?

30:13.289 --> 30:14.769
Well, I'm not going
to ring the bell.

30:14.813 --> 30:16.597
I just wanted to take a look.Look,

30:16.640 --> 30:19.382
I'm coming to you right now.
Don't do anything.

30:19.426 --> 30:22.081
I'm not gonna do anything.

30:22.124 --> 30:23.169
[sighs]

30:25.214 --> 30:27.695
Who are you going to bring in
now to try to change my mind?

30:27.738 --> 30:30.350
Changing your mind is going
to have to come from you.

30:30.393 --> 30:31.699
I don't want him to go free.

30:31.742 --> 30:33.048
So tell us what happened.

30:33.092 --> 30:36.051
Look, if I cooperate...

30:36.095 --> 30:37.792
it's a death sentence.

30:37.836 --> 30:40.316
And if you don't,
it's also one.

30:41.665 --> 30:43.450
What're you talking about?

30:44.668 --> 30:47.889
When I was 15, I saw my
best friend get killed.

30:47.933 --> 30:49.804
Like you,

30:49.848 --> 30:51.762
I was the only witness.

30:51.806 --> 30:53.286
I was afraid of the cops

30:53.329 --> 30:56.463
and even more so
afraid of the gangs.

30:57.551 --> 30:59.292
So, you know what I did?

31:01.120 --> 31:02.861
Nothing.

31:04.384 --> 31:08.475
That decision was a
death sentence for me.

31:09.955 --> 31:13.001
It haunted me every single day.

31:16.004 --> 31:19.878
I became a prosecutor
to make amends.

31:20.704 --> 31:22.532
What happened to the shooter?

31:22.576 --> 31:25.187
He got away with it.

31:31.324 --> 31:34.066
I just want things
to go back to normal.

31:34.109 --> 31:38.200
Keisha, they're never
going back to normal.

31:38.244 --> 31:40.115
The only thing
you can control now

31:40.159 --> 31:42.074
is whether you testify or not.

31:42.117 --> 31:44.685
Time to make
a choice.

31:44.728 --> 31:46.339
Are you going to run scared?

31:46.382 --> 31:48.819
Or are you going
to be a strong woman

31:48.863 --> 31:52.345
and help us put away
Tory's killer?

32:01.832 --> 32:03.399
[sobs]

32:06.968 --> 32:09.536
[sniffles]
Malik did it.

32:10.537 --> 32:13.235
He shot Tory.

32:15.890 --> 32:18.632
[crying]

32:21.287 --> 32:23.115
Hey, it's Detective Baez.
I'm off duty.

32:23.158 --> 32:25.378
Can you run a plate for me?

32:25.421 --> 32:26.857
New York plate,

32:26.901 --> 32:30.383
Mike, Nora, Oscar, 9-1-8-8.

32:30.426 --> 32:33.255
Yeah, I'm on my cell. Thanks.

32:45.746 --> 32:48.357
This is Detective Baez
from 5-4 detective squad

32:48.401 --> 32:52.144
requesting a 10-85
and a bus forthwith

32:52.187 --> 32:55.234
to 143 Gravesend Neck Road.

33:02.067 --> 33:04.286
â™ª

33:14.818 --> 33:17.038
â™ª

33:19.127 --> 33:21.956
[screams, gasping]

33:23.131 --> 33:25.438
[grunting]

33:26.569 --> 33:28.963
[panicked gasping]

33:45.719 --> 33:46.937
[yells]

33:46.981 --> 33:48.635
DANNY [in distance]:
Baez?!

33:48.678 --> 33:50.245
Baez! Where you at?!

33:50.289 --> 33:52.682
BAEZ [gasping]:
Danny.

33:52.726 --> 33:55.120
In here!

33:57.296 --> 33:59.254
On the ground.
On the ground now!

33:59.298 --> 34:01.343
Get on the ground!
Don't move.

34:01.387 --> 34:03.650
You okay, partner?Are you gonna shoot me?

34:03.693 --> 34:05.173
Go ahead and shoot me.

34:05.217 --> 34:07.262
Do it.DANNY: Don't listen to him,
you hear me?

34:07.306 --> 34:09.221
He gets in your head, he wins.
Don't let him.

34:09.264 --> 34:10.483
Go ahead, shoot me.Shut up!

34:10.526 --> 34:13.529
You won't do it.DANNY: Shut up!

34:13.573 --> 34:14.922
Because you're weak.

34:14.965 --> 34:16.880
Just like
all the other women.

34:16.924 --> 34:18.273
Baez. Baez!

34:19.492 --> 34:21.320
Don't do it.

34:33.375 --> 34:36.161
You lose.

34:37.249 --> 34:38.989
[breathlessly]:
Hey.

34:39.033 --> 34:41.296
Hey.

34:41.340 --> 34:43.124
You son of a bitch.

34:43.907 --> 34:46.127
Is she okay?No.

34:46.171 --> 34:47.824
[indistinct radio transmissions]Baez.

34:47.868 --> 34:49.478
Hey.
[sighs]

34:49.522 --> 34:51.306
Hey.

34:51.350 --> 34:53.047
Baez. Hey.[sighs]: What?

34:53.091 --> 34:55.267
Hey, what the hell
is going on?

34:55.310 --> 34:56.659
I should've shot him.

34:56.703 --> 34:58.139
No, you shouldn't
have shot him.

34:58.183 --> 34:59.836
Are you crazy?
You did the right thing.

34:59.880 --> 35:02.535
He purposely preyed on girls
he thought no one cared about.

35:02.578 --> 35:05.320
And he won't be able to kill
any more now because of you.

35:05.364 --> 35:07.148
[sighs]Just do me a favor.

35:07.192 --> 35:09.542
Just don't go off on your own
again, please?

35:09.585 --> 35:11.196
You've done it plenty of times.

35:11.239 --> 35:13.589
In fact, Danny Reagan
wrote the book on that.

35:13.633 --> 35:15.330
I don't want you
to be like Danny Reagan.

35:15.374 --> 35:16.462
Why not?

35:17.289 --> 35:19.726
Because I like Maria Baez.

35:21.945 --> 35:24.034
[sighs]

35:24.078 --> 35:25.688
Come on.

35:25.732 --> 35:28.082
Let's go.

35:35.220 --> 35:37.570
How'd it go?

35:37.613 --> 35:40.442
Good. The jury
really responded to Keisha.

35:40.486 --> 35:42.879
Malik's attorney
wants to talk about a plea.

35:42.923 --> 35:44.272
Great news.

35:46.405 --> 35:49.016
I think sharing your story
really helped.

35:49.886 --> 35:52.498
Did you ever pursue an arrest
in that killing?

35:52.541 --> 35:54.761
I didn't have to.
I made it up.

35:57.416 --> 35:58.199
Wow.

35:58.243 --> 36:00.332
I did Keisha a favor.

36:00.375 --> 36:03.204
Keeping that secret
would've eaten her alive.

36:04.423 --> 36:06.468
Clearly we approach
things differently,

36:06.512 --> 36:08.209
have different styles.

36:08.253 --> 36:10.603
Yes, different styles.

36:10.646 --> 36:13.649
Different styles,
but we're on the same team.

36:14.694 --> 36:17.479
The same team,
different playbook.

36:19.960 --> 36:21.266
Good night, Erin.

36:21.309 --> 36:23.616
Good night.

36:26.619 --> 36:29.622
You got a warrant
to search my phone?

36:29.665 --> 36:31.232
It's all legal,
Ms. Butler.

36:31.276 --> 36:33.321
Well, I will not testify,
even if I am subpoenaed.

36:33.365 --> 36:35.323
It doesn't matter. We already
got the video off your phone,

36:35.367 --> 36:37.369
ran it through
facial recognition,

36:37.412 --> 36:38.935
so we've already
arrested the shooter.

36:38.979 --> 36:39.632
So you think it's okay to just
trample First Amendment rights

36:39.675 --> 36:41.242
to get what you need?

36:41.286 --> 36:43.244
I used the law
to get what I needed.

36:43.288 --> 36:46.116
Which is exactly why
some people hate cops.

36:46.160 --> 36:47.248
Like you?

36:47.292 --> 36:49.381
The ends don't justify
the means.

36:49.424 --> 36:50.860
I'll sleep just fine tonight

36:50.904 --> 36:53.341
knowing that a would-be killer
is behind bars.

36:57.040 --> 36:58.607
[door opens]

36:59.869 --> 37:02.045
A hard copy, as requested.

37:02.089 --> 37:04.222
Thank you, Baker.

37:07.312 --> 37:09.488
Is there something else?

37:09.531 --> 37:10.837
No.

37:11.707 --> 37:14.275
You're wondering
if I am planning

37:14.319 --> 37:15.885
to say or do something

37:15.929 --> 37:18.366
that would get me into trouble
and the answer is yes.

37:18.410 --> 37:20.629
Should I stay?

37:22.631 --> 37:23.632
[sighs]

37:23.676 --> 37:27.157
I'd like you to, but you can't.

37:34.904 --> 37:36.210
Commissioner,
the New York Attorney General,

37:36.254 --> 37:37.864
Robert Lewis, is here.

37:37.907 --> 37:40.301
The phones not working?

37:40.345 --> 37:43.652
Thank you
for taking the trouble.

37:45.567 --> 37:48.788
At what point do we both
just say "moving on"?

37:48.831 --> 37:50.964
Soon, I hope, Robert.

37:51.007 --> 37:54.054
Uh, we arrested the shooter
in the looting incident.

37:54.097 --> 37:55.447
Great news.

37:55.490 --> 37:58.319
The press was afforded
full access to the arrest

37:58.363 --> 38:00.060
and to the perp walk.

38:00.103 --> 38:01.061
Thank you.
Yeah.

38:01.104 --> 38:02.323
Full transparency,

38:02.367 --> 38:03.803
that's what you want.

38:03.846 --> 38:06.327
Yes. Always.

38:07.197 --> 38:10.200
Full transparency for everybody?

38:12.855 --> 38:15.641
Is that the sound
of one shoe dropping?

38:15.684 --> 38:20.733
Well, I just want to be clear
on the protocol moving forward.

38:20.776 --> 38:23.518
If a member of the press,
for instance,

38:23.562 --> 38:26.913
finds herself or himself
with inside information

38:26.956 --> 38:31.526
on your office, for example,
personal information,

38:31.570 --> 38:36.618
does that still call
for full transparency?

38:39.447 --> 38:42.363
Run that by me again?

38:44.409 --> 38:48.282
Diane Butler's phone records.

38:51.416 --> 38:55.028
You were her first call
after her release.

38:57.291 --> 38:58.553
Yeah, well, I know her.

38:58.597 --> 39:00.729
She covers my press conferences.

39:00.773 --> 39:03.079
[laughs]

39:03.123 --> 39:05.517
That's all you got?

39:05.560 --> 39:09.521
Like I'm supposed to say,
"Oh, that explains it."

39:10.478 --> 39:13.394
[scoffs]
She has my number. So?

39:13.438 --> 39:15.875
And now I do, too.

39:15.918 --> 39:17.920
Got your number.

39:17.964 --> 39:20.270
Look, she's a friend.

39:20.314 --> 39:24.100
Hey, you don't have
to explain to me.

39:24.144 --> 39:27.103
But the press might ask
how the attorney general's

39:27.147 --> 39:30.368
personal number
got into a reporter's phone.

39:30.411 --> 39:31.543
I told you...Or about your use

39:31.586 --> 39:34.284
of an official state car
and driver

39:34.328 --> 39:38.158
for overnight... meetings

39:38.201 --> 39:41.640
at her East Village apartment.

39:45.121 --> 39:47.080
Hey...

39:47.123 --> 39:48.037
cops talk.

39:48.081 --> 39:50.518
Small-town cops, big-city cops,

39:50.562 --> 39:53.695
New York State Troopers.

39:55.480 --> 39:58.352
Talk about down and dirty.

39:58.918 --> 40:02.008
Well, I don't like it either,
Robert,

40:02.051 --> 40:05.185
but I didn't pick the fight.

40:09.232 --> 40:10.973
I can talk to the mayor.

40:11.017 --> 40:13.454
About what?

40:13.498 --> 40:16.414
About restoring oversight
of press passes to this office.

40:16.457 --> 40:19.678
But my personal business
is off-limits.

40:19.721 --> 40:24.509
So, full transparency
unless it makes you look bad.

40:24.552 --> 40:29.296
Boy, I sure wish my cops
had the same courtesy.

40:30.079 --> 40:32.430
We done here?

40:34.388 --> 40:37.435
My regards to Mrs. Lewis.

40:41.743 --> 40:43.658
â™ª

40:48.054 --> 40:50.273
[sighs]

41:01.023 --> 41:02.155
Hi.
Hi.

41:02.198 --> 41:03.722
Where's Pops?

41:03.765 --> 41:05.419
Oh, probably killing it

41:05.463 --> 41:07.247
at poker night
with his buddies.

41:10.511 --> 41:14.210
You did not need a roast
for Sunday dinner.

41:14.994 --> 41:16.778
We can always freeze one.

41:25.134 --> 41:26.440
Hey.

41:26.484 --> 41:27.659
Hey.

41:34.317 --> 41:35.754
Your idea?

41:35.797 --> 41:37.799
Their idea.

41:38.974 --> 41:42.021
He threatened us with fishing
at 4:00 a.m. if we didn't.

41:42.848 --> 41:46.634
And sorry for barging in
in front of your new boss.

41:50.333 --> 41:52.379
Sorry for giving you
such a hard time.

41:52.422 --> 41:54.642
Won't happen again.

41:56.165 --> 41:58.516
Yes, it will.

42:01.693 --> 42:04.086
Okay, well, I promise to be
less like him about it.

42:04.130 --> 42:07.873
Thanks.Only room for one of those
in the family.

42:10.353 --> 42:13.574
Crawford thinks
our family has a monopoly

42:13.618 --> 42:16.185
on the justice system.

42:18.144 --> 42:22.322
Really? Why don't we give
ourselves a raise then.

42:24.063 --> 42:25.673
And a family compound.

42:26.500 --> 42:29.547
I'll be sure and work on that.
