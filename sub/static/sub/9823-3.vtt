<i>Previously on "Better Call Saul..."</i>

00:02.633 --> 00:04.094
Clifford Main hired jimmy.

00:04.182 --> 00:05.081
He had his doubts.

00:05.229 --> 00:07.495
Truth be told, Kim Wexler pushed for this.

00:07.823 --> 00:09.039
You faked evidence.

00:09.124 --> 00:11.158
Mmm, I think you're splitting hairs.

00:11.260 --> 00:13.594
Why would you risk the
best job you've ever had

00:13.679 --> 00:15.462
for some pro-bono case?

00:15.547 --> 00:17.764
I was hoping, maybe,
you could do me a favor.

00:17.866 --> 00:19.766
Anything you need, I'll be there.

00:19.852 --> 00:21.468
You still in touch with your people?

00:21.553 --> 00:23.470
Depends on the type of
work you're looking for.

00:23.555 --> 00:24.771
You tell me what you got.

00:24.857 --> 00:25.973
I'll tell you what I'll do.

00:26.058 --> 00:26.974
Why are you here?

00:28.010 --> 00:29.992
To bear witness.

Advertise your product or brand here

01:14.306 --> 01:16.340
Sorry about the hiccup, folks.
It won't be long.

01:28.570 --> 01:29.936
You got five minutes.

01:34.743 --> 01:37.110
Howdy, folks.

01:37.162 --> 01:40.781
Could someone tell me
if Mrs. Alma May Urbano

01:40.783 --> 01:41.915
is on board?

01:41.950 --> 01:43.333
Alma May Urbano.

01:44.586 --> 01:47.120
There you are. Hello, dear.

01:47.122 --> 01:49.289
Very good to meet you.

01:49.341 --> 01:50.340
My name's Jimmy.

01:50.376 --> 01:51.858
I tried to visit you at Sandpiper,

01:51.894 --> 01:53.927
but they wouldn't allow me to.

01:53.962 --> 01:55.379
Hey, you know what?

01:55.431 --> 01:56.630
It doesn't matter.

01:56.632 --> 01:59.299
I saw your bus broken down, here you are.

01:59.449 --> 02:00.648
Lucky me.

02:00.700 --> 02:03.401
Do you prefer to be called Mrs. Urbano

02:03.453 --> 02:05.737
or Alma May or just plain Alma?

02:05.789 --> 02:09.407
My last name is McGill,
but you can call me Jimmy.

02:09.459 --> 02:11.075
Hey, everyone! My name's Jimmy McGill.

02:11.128 --> 02:14.746
I'm an attorney at law,
but, uh, don't mind me.

02:14.798 --> 02:17.248
Just talk amongst yourselves.

02:17.250 --> 02:18.750
Now, Alma May,

02:18.752 --> 02:21.719
do you recall responding to a mailer

02:21.755 --> 02:25.924
from my law firm, Davis & Main,
of Santa Fe, New Mexico?

02:25.976 --> 02:27.308
I... I don't know.

02:27.344 --> 02:31.179
Well, we were looking to help
any Sandpiper residents

02:31.231 --> 02:33.565
who may have been overcharged

02:33.600 --> 02:36.234
for, uh, basic goods and services.

02:36.269 --> 02:37.519
Now, does that ring a bell?

02:37.571 --> 02:40.772
Oh! Maybe. Was it yellow?

02:40.824 --> 02:41.990
It's canary yellow.

02:42.025 --> 02:43.825
I picked that color myself.

02:45.328 --> 02:48.112
Well, ma'am, I'm here to make
sure you get your money back.

02:48.165 --> 02:50.198
What are you talking about?

02:50.250 --> 02:51.499
Who took Alma May's money?

02:51.535 --> 02:54.169
Uh, well, now, that's a very good question.

02:54.204 --> 02:56.671
And thank you for asking, mister, uh...?

02:56.706 --> 02:58.873
Amos... Amos Lydecker.

02:58.925 --> 03:01.426
Mr. Lydecker, Jimmy McGill.

03:01.461 --> 03:04.712
Now, nobody took
anybody's money, uh, exactly.

03:04.764 --> 03:05.964
Okay?

03:05.966 --> 03:08.600
It's not like the Sandpiper
people, you know,

03:08.635 --> 03:11.603
put on a ski mask and, uh...

03:11.638 --> 03:15.273
mugged Alma May here at gunpoint.

03:15.308 --> 03:18.059
So I want you to put that mental
image right out of your head.

03:18.111 --> 03:19.777
See, what we're talking about
here is more of a...

03:19.813 --> 03:21.279
it's just a discrepancy.

03:21.314 --> 03:22.947
It's... it's a little thing.

03:22.983 --> 03:25.149
It's... it's fairly innocent.

03:25.151 --> 03:26.951
But we need to fix it.

03:26.987 --> 03:28.236
Do you follow me?

03:29.990 --> 03:31.489
Well, put it this way.

03:31.491 --> 03:35.126
Alma May, let's say you're out
on a date with your boyfriend.

03:35.161 --> 03:37.078
You do have a boyfriend, right?

03:37.130 --> 03:38.746
Ah! You don't?

03:38.798 --> 03:39.881
Come on. You...

03:39.916 --> 03:42.166
Alma May's holding out on me.

03:43.169 --> 03:44.802
Do you have a nephew?

03:44.838 --> 03:47.338
Nephew? Oh, y-yes... Steve.

03:47.390 --> 03:48.556
Okay, Steve.

03:48.592 --> 03:51.175
- Is he a good guy?
- Yeah, very good.

03:51.177 --> 03:52.343
Okay.

03:52.395 --> 03:54.395
So, let's say you and Steve go out to dinner

03:54.431 --> 03:56.147
at, uh... well, Birdie's.

03:56.182 --> 03:58.850
That's where you're all headed today, right?

03:58.852 --> 04:00.735
All right.

04:00.770 --> 04:03.021
So, both of you have a great meal.

04:03.073 --> 04:05.690
It's chicken-fried steak and green beans,

04:05.692 --> 04:07.091
and it's all perfect.

04:07.127 --> 04:09.160
Here comes the check.

04:09.195 --> 04:11.362
"Hey, wait a doggone..."

04:11.364 --> 04:14.916
24 bucks for a side of buttermilk biscuits?

04:14.951 --> 04:17.084
"That doesn't sound right, now, does it?"

04:17.120 --> 04:18.586
No, it does not.

04:18.622 --> 04:21.505
It sounds like something got added up wrong.

04:21.541 --> 04:24.342
Well, naturally, you send your nephew Steve

04:24.377 --> 04:26.110
to talk to the manager,

04:26.146 --> 04:28.930
and naturally, the manager
corrects the mistake.

04:28.965 --> 04:31.299
And what's more, he gives you a coupon

04:31.351 --> 04:33.635
for a free meal next time you come in.

04:33.687 --> 04:34.636
How about that?

04:34.688 --> 04:36.104
Good.

04:36.139 --> 04:40.892
Well, same kind of thing is what
happened at Sandpiper Crossing.

04:42.646 --> 04:47.065
And nothing makes me sadder

04:47.067 --> 04:50.401
than to see people
of the Greatest Generation...

04:50.403 --> 04:53.571
people like my own Nana and Bobo...

04:53.573 --> 04:57.742
gettin' overcharged
by some great, big company...

04:57.744 --> 04:59.827
even if it was an accident.

05:00.997 --> 05:04.082
Now, I know that the
good people at Sandpiper

05:04.084 --> 05:08.252
want to make this right sooner
or later, but you know what?

05:08.254 --> 05:12.256
Well, sometimes, it's just easier

05:12.258 --> 05:17.929
if you get your nephew Steve
to go take care of it for you.

05:17.931 --> 05:22.600
And that's how I want you to think of me.

05:22.652 --> 05:24.769
Georgiana.

05:24.771 --> 05:26.270
Hey, there, Georgie girl. Thank you.

05:26.272 --> 05:28.356
Oh, it's all there, everything I need.

05:28.408 --> 05:31.159
Thank you so much. Enjoy your lunch.

05:31.194 --> 05:33.027
Alma May, you did it.

05:33.079 --> 05:35.413
Thank you so much. Thank you.

05:35.448 --> 05:37.865
Thank you, Henry.

05:37.917 --> 05:39.250
All right.

05:39.285 --> 05:41.369
Hey, Sue. Okay.

05:41.421 --> 05:43.755
Beautiful penmanship.

05:43.790 --> 05:45.123
A lost art.

06:00.396 --> 06:02.463
Schweikart and Cokely are
pursuing an aggressive strategy,

06:02.499 --> 06:03.965
but looking at the relevant case law,

06:04.000 --> 06:06.985
I don't think it's going to
play with this magistrate judge.

06:07.037 --> 06:09.120
I read over a dozen of her rulings,

06:09.155 --> 06:12.573
all of which have sided with the
plaintiff on cases like this.

06:12.626 --> 06:15.810
I've included a memo to that
effect in today's materials,

06:15.845 --> 06:17.879
which you can peruse at your leisure.

06:17.914 --> 06:19.180
Thanks, Erin.

06:19.215 --> 06:23.184
How about we move on to client outreach?

06:25.889 --> 06:27.822
Jimmy?

06:27.857 --> 06:28.806
You still with us?

06:28.842 --> 06:30.258
Uh...

06:30.260 --> 06:32.343
I'm gonna save you from having to brag.

06:32.395 --> 06:34.095
Over 200 new Sandpiper clients

06:34.097 --> 06:35.930
signed over the past three weeks.

06:35.982 --> 06:37.098
Well-done, Jimmy.

06:37.100 --> 06:38.599
Thank you. Thanks, Cliff.

06:38.601 --> 06:40.018
Uh, right now,

06:40.070 --> 06:43.664
we're in the process of mapping
out the entire southwest,

06:43.866 --> 06:47.268
targeting the largest
Sandpiper facilities first.

06:47.351 --> 06:50.936
Phoenix, Colorado Springs,
Fort Worth, Provo...

06:50.988 --> 06:52.455
that's just for starters.

06:52.502 --> 06:56.170
Ideally, my goal... another 200
by the end of the month.

06:56.222 --> 06:58.406
With this many folks,
we have an excellent shot

06:58.441 --> 07:00.308
at a solid batch of plaintiffs

07:00.343 --> 07:02.343
for the classes in each district.

07:02.395 --> 07:03.428
Excellent.

07:03.480 --> 07:05.763
Look forward to the next report.

07:05.815 --> 07:09.016
On to a stickier wicket...
coordinating actions.

07:09.069 --> 07:10.151
I'm sorry.

07:10.186 --> 07:12.570
Before we move on, I'd like to go back

07:12.605 --> 07:15.189
to client outreach just for a moment.

07:15.241 --> 07:17.275
Looking over these numbers here,

07:17.327 --> 07:20.194
really, astonishing results, Jimmy.

07:20.196 --> 07:21.245
Incredible.

07:21.281 --> 07:23.614
Your last trip to Amarillo,

07:23.666 --> 07:26.451
you came back with 22 new clients.

07:26.503 --> 07:28.703
- 24.
- 24.

07:28.755 --> 07:30.004
I'm confused.

07:30.039 --> 07:31.773
Um, how many people out there

07:31.808 --> 07:35.209
actually responded to our direct mailer?

07:35.261 --> 07:37.044
One.

07:37.097 --> 07:39.480
Oh. Right. Yeah.

07:39.516 --> 07:42.733
A Mrs. Alma May Urbano.

07:42.769 --> 07:49.624
But you got 24 new clients
from this one response?

07:49.659 --> 07:53.561
That is... [Chuckles] Wow.

07:53.596 --> 07:54.829
Well, you're welcome.

07:54.864 --> 07:56.631
I mean, what? Is there a problem?

07:56.666 --> 07:58.866
Well, uh, might not some parties...

07:58.918 --> 08:01.202
the opposing counsel, for example...

08:01.254 --> 08:03.454
see this differential and conclude

08:03.506 --> 08:06.624
that there may have been
some solicitation involved?

08:06.676 --> 08:08.342
I did not solicit.

08:08.378 --> 08:10.344
I'm just wondering how
you account for your success.

08:10.380 --> 08:11.963
Because it will definitely raise eyebrows

08:12.015 --> 08:14.348
over at Schweikart & Cokely.

08:14.384 --> 08:16.434
I'm sorry, but it will.

08:16.469 --> 08:19.687
Particularly in a case involving seniors,

08:19.722 --> 08:23.357
for whom the ethical
guidelines on solicitation

08:23.393 --> 08:26.144
were virtually created by the ABA.

08:26.196 --> 08:28.980
Chuck, I'm sure that...

08:30.066 --> 08:32.732
Jimmy, if you could clear this up,

08:32.784 --> 08:34.467
that would be helpful.

08:34.504 --> 08:38.039
I went to Amarillo to confer with a client

08:38.073 --> 08:42.443
and to make sure that we had
a solid, good-faith basis

08:42.477 --> 08:45.046
for our case there, overall.

08:45.081 --> 08:46.881
And as many of you are aware,

08:46.916 --> 08:49.817
I've visited more than my share
of retirement homes.

08:49.853 --> 08:51.636
These are close-knit communities.

08:51.671 --> 08:53.971
Let me tell you, word gets around real fast.

08:54.007 --> 08:57.091
If Dorothy in Phase Two
gets a new Rascal Scooter,

08:57.093 --> 08:58.593
well, it's big news.

08:58.645 --> 09:01.679
So these other 23 residents,
they approached you.

09:01.731 --> 09:03.314
Cliff, they heard the scuttlebutt

09:03.349 --> 09:05.399
before I crossed state lines.

09:05.435 --> 09:08.903
And I certainly didn't have to
go knocking on any doors.

09:08.938 --> 09:12.023
And is it any surprise
that they want to speak

09:12.075 --> 09:13.741
with the guy who was there to show them

09:13.776 --> 09:15.343
they may have money coming their way?

09:15.378 --> 09:18.663
I gotta tell you, with all that in mind,

09:18.698 --> 09:20.915
I should've done better.

09:22.085 --> 09:24.869
Makes sense. Howard?

09:25.955 --> 09:28.189
Chuck?

09:28.224 --> 09:30.157
We good to move on?

09:32.712 --> 09:34.679
And, Chuck, not incidentally,

09:34.714 --> 09:36.097
it is absolutely vital

09:36.132 --> 09:38.432
that we dot our I's and cross our T's here.

09:38.468 --> 09:39.433
Invaluable.

09:39.469 --> 09:41.636
So, thank you.

09:41.688 --> 09:43.804
The price of excellence
is eternal vigilance.

09:43.806 --> 09:46.807
Indeed.

09:46.809 --> 09:47.975
Coordination.

09:47.977 --> 09:49.944
I believe that's where we left off.

09:49.979 --> 09:51.145
That's right.

09:51.197 --> 09:53.564
Brian, this is your thing,
so why don't you take this?

09:53.616 --> 09:54.982
Sure.

09:55.034 --> 09:57.735
Considering the dimensions of these cases,

09:57.787 --> 09:59.654
taken together and individually,

09:59.706 --> 10:01.739
it makes sense to designate someone

10:01.791 --> 10:03.157
to handle the scheduling.

10:03.159 --> 10:06.210
What I'm proposing is that
we create a small team at D&M

10:06.246 --> 10:08.963
dedicated specifically
to coordinating all elements

10:08.998 --> 10:10.498
of the individual actions.

10:10.500 --> 10:13.000
- We'll loop in HHM on anything...
- Uh, Brian, I'm sorry.

10:13.052 --> 10:14.835
Excuse me for interrupting.

10:14.837 --> 10:17.972
Uh, I just want to say
that I take Chuck's point.

10:18.007 --> 10:19.340
I do.

10:19.342 --> 10:23.177
I mean, this is, like,
a wife-of-Caesar type of thing.

10:23.179 --> 10:26.681
There can't even be a hint of solicitation.

10:26.733 --> 10:28.849
So I'm gonna pull back.

10:28.901 --> 10:31.185
All right, no more meet-and-greets

10:31.187 --> 10:33.154
at the Sandpiper facilities.

10:33.189 --> 10:35.156
I'll find another way to proceed.

10:35.191 --> 10:37.792
Well, Jimmy, we'll leave that up to you.

10:37.827 --> 10:40.361
You know, client outreach
is your department.

10:40.413 --> 10:43.030
Uh, where was I?

10:43.082 --> 10:44.865
Okay, right.

10:44.867 --> 10:47.668
If we have a more consolidated
nerve center here in New Mexico,

10:47.704 --> 10:48.669
where the...

10:56.045 --> 10:57.545
Hey, Kim, uh, where can I get a copy

10:57.547 --> 10:58.846
of that Neiderman deposition?

10:58.881 --> 11:00.298
I've got an extra Neiderman, Jimmy.

11:00.350 --> 11:01.766
You can have one of mine.

11:01.801 --> 11:03.100
Oh, wow. Thanks, Erin.

11:03.136 --> 11:04.218
Yeah, no worries.

11:05.722 --> 11:07.555
Shoot. Where'd I put that?

11:07.557 --> 11:10.224
Thanks, that's...

11:12.061 --> 11:15.112
Man, do you believe Chuck in there?

11:15.148 --> 11:16.897
Jesus. Solicitation?

11:16.899 --> 11:18.733
Let me tell you, when we
were building this case,

11:18.735 --> 11:21.569
I was chasing down 80-year-old mall walkers.

11:21.621 --> 11:23.237
That was solicitation.

11:23.239 --> 11:24.739
But did he say "boo"?

11:24.741 --> 11:26.624
Bullshit he did.

11:26.659 --> 11:28.292
What happened in Texas?

11:28.328 --> 11:29.960
Nothing.

11:29.996 --> 11:32.313
I did my job.

11:32.348 --> 11:33.998
You didn't do a song and dance in
the dayroom for the old-timers?

11:34.050 --> 11:35.666
No. No.

11:35.718 --> 11:38.836
Not... not in the dayroom.

11:38.888 --> 11:41.339
Jimmy, you know solicitation
can get you disbarred.

11:41.391 --> 11:42.340
This matters.

11:42.392 --> 11:43.924
Well, here's what I think matters...

11:43.976 --> 11:46.093
24 senior citizens now have representation.

11:46.145 --> 11:47.428
Before I went,

11:47.480 --> 11:49.397
they didn't even know
they were getting ripped off.

11:49.432 --> 11:51.015
Now they have us in their corner.

11:51.067 --> 11:52.767
How is that not a win?

11:52.769 --> 11:55.569
You said in there you'd find another way.

11:55.605 --> 11:57.438
Did you mean it?

11:57.440 --> 12:00.191
Sure. Absolutely. I...

12:05.748 --> 12:07.081
Look, I...

12:08.918 --> 12:11.869
I need you to understand
something very critical here.

12:11.921 --> 12:13.120
Shoot.

12:14.674 --> 12:17.658
I put myself on the line
to get you this job.

12:18.728 --> 12:20.010
Uh, okay.

12:20.046 --> 12:22.797
I thought it was 'cause
I'm sensational with old people.

12:22.849 --> 12:25.516
Yeah, and who do you think told them that?

12:25.551 --> 12:27.635
So, what... you threw me a bone?

12:27.687 --> 12:29.270
No... asshole.

12:29.305 --> 12:32.390
You know I believe in you.

12:33.976 --> 12:36.143
But then I made my beliefs known to them.

12:36.195 --> 12:38.863
And now everything you do
reflects back on me with Howard,

12:38.898 --> 12:40.698
'cause ultimately, I talked him into

12:40.733 --> 12:42.867
going out on a limb for you, too.

12:44.203 --> 12:45.486
Do you understand?

12:45.538 --> 12:48.789
It's... it's... it's my word,
it's my judgment.

12:48.825 --> 12:49.824
Yeah.

12:54.714 --> 12:58.416
You and I both know you can do this job.

13:03.306 --> 13:05.890
But please, you just have to do it right.

13:16.352 --> 13:19.153
Well... you want to make sure

13:19.188 --> 13:23.991
you put in the batteries
the right way or he won't work.

13:24.026 --> 13:26.360
Then you close them up.

13:26.412 --> 13:27.578
And...

13:27.613 --> 13:32.283
I think... I think
you're good to go, young lady.

13:32.335 --> 13:36.337
Why don't you give his foot a squeeze?

13:40.126 --> 13:43.177
He's funny!

13:43.212 --> 13:44.879
Oh, darlin'.

13:46.549 --> 13:51.552
I think I'll name you... Mr. Snuggles.

13:53.055 --> 13:54.355
Are you hungry?

13:54.390 --> 13:57.308
I'm gonna get you some mashed potatoes.

13:57.360 --> 14:00.027
That should get you through to next month.

14:01.230 --> 14:02.530
Mike, thank you.

14:02.565 --> 14:05.199
But you shouldn't feel that you need to...

14:05.234 --> 14:06.567
Too late.

14:12.241 --> 14:13.741
Something up?

14:13.743 --> 14:15.042
Mm.

14:15.077 --> 14:17.378
Feels like something's up.

14:17.413 --> 14:18.712
No, it's...

14:18.748 --> 14:20.464
I didn't get much sleep.

14:20.500 --> 14:22.216
My head's... I'm sorry.

14:22.251 --> 14:25.419
You tell me it's none of
my business, I'll drop it.

14:25.471 --> 14:27.338
I don't want you to worry.

14:27.390 --> 14:29.990
Not the worrying kind.

14:33.229 --> 14:35.796
Last two nights, I heard gunshots.

14:35.831 --> 14:39.166
First night, they were
maybe a block or two over

14:39.202 --> 14:40.201
and woke me up.

14:40.236 --> 14:41.902
My first thought was firecrackers,

14:41.938 --> 14:43.938
and that's what I assumed at the time,

14:43.990 --> 14:46.407
but then last night...
there's no mistaking it.

14:46.442 --> 14:47.825
There was three of them.

14:47.860 --> 14:50.110
They were quick... pop, pop, pop... closer.

14:50.112 --> 14:51.278
It was...

14:51.330 --> 14:53.364
Like they were right outside the house.

14:53.416 --> 14:54.365
You call the cops?

14:54.417 --> 14:55.749
Yeah.

14:55.785 --> 14:57.418
Took them over an hour to get here,

14:57.453 --> 14:59.537
then they looked around
for a whole two minutes,

14:59.589 --> 15:01.755
but by then, of course,
there was nothing to see.

15:03.292 --> 15:05.342
I'm staying here tonight.

15:05.378 --> 15:06.594
No, Mike, no.

15:06.629 --> 15:07.928
That's not necessary.

15:07.964 --> 15:09.630
No, it is not a problem.

15:09.682 --> 15:10.965
I'll take the couch.

15:11.017 --> 15:13.934
Mike, you asked, so... I answered.

15:13.970 --> 15:17.221
Please don't make me sorry I told you.

15:22.883 --> 15:25.234
Kaylee, come, hmm?

15:25.296 --> 15:27.463
Get your supper.

15:42.995 --> 15:45.946
What about Colorado Springs?

15:45.948 --> 15:47.047
Um...

15:47.083 --> 15:52.036
283 residents, and we sent out 283 mailers.

15:52.088 --> 15:55.005
Yeah, and how many response cards came back?

15:55.041 --> 15:56.507
Zero.

15:56.542 --> 15:58.042
Zero?

16:00.179 --> 16:03.197
Son of a bitch.

16:03.232 --> 16:05.132
Dana, Toni, have a good one.

16:05.184 --> 16:06.383
You, too, Mr. Main.

16:06.546 --> 16:08.746
Cliff, uh, could I have a second?

16:09.714 --> 16:10.713
What's up?

16:10.749 --> 16:12.965
Uh, yeah, it's the Sandpiper mailers.

16:13.001 --> 16:15.218
Yeah, we should be getting responses

16:15.253 --> 16:16.469
of like 12 to 15 percent,

16:16.504 --> 16:18.638
but we're getting ones and twos.

16:18.673 --> 16:20.506
In Colorado Springs, zero.

16:20.558 --> 16:22.141
Wow. How can that be?

16:22.177 --> 16:23.476
I'm thinking it's the staff.

16:23.511 --> 16:24.727
They're tossing the mailers

16:24.763 --> 16:26.345
before they can reach the residents.

16:26.347 --> 16:29.682
Maybe they got told to do it
by the Sandpiper front office,

16:29.684 --> 16:31.768
which would be actionable as hell.

16:31.820 --> 16:34.070
If we could prove it. Big "if."

16:34.105 --> 16:37.774
And to do so would take
more manpower than I can spare.

16:37.826 --> 16:40.610
For now, let's just stick with
getting those client numbers up.

16:40.662 --> 16:42.495
Guess you better think of another way.

16:42.530 --> 16:43.996
I think I got it.

16:44.032 --> 16:46.265
TV commercial. Highly targeted.

16:46.317 --> 16:50.103
Let me tell you, at Sandpiper,
the trains run on time.

16:50.155 --> 16:52.155
Mussolini would be proud.

16:52.190 --> 16:55.608
Every one I visited so far,
same exact schedule.

16:55.660 --> 16:57.443
10:00 a.m., water aerobics.

16:57.495 --> 16:59.112
2:00 p.m., line dancing.

16:59.164 --> 17:00.413
So on and so forth.

17:00.448 --> 17:02.949
They always leave 3:00 p.m.
to 4:00 p.m. free.

17:03.001 --> 17:04.951
Why? "Murder, She Wrote."

17:06.087 --> 17:07.703
It's been in syndication
since like the 1850s,

17:07.704 --> 17:09.789
and let me tell you,
when that thing comes on,

17:09.840 --> 17:12.592
it draws the blue-hairs
like moths to a bug zapper.

17:13.762 --> 17:16.679
3:14 p.m., end of the first-act cliffhanger,

17:16.714 --> 17:19.098
first commercial up, Davis & Main.

17:19.134 --> 17:21.634
Guaranteed eyeballs... lots of 'em.

17:21.685 --> 17:23.469
There's nothing Sandpiper can do about that.

17:23.521 --> 17:25.855
We ran a commercial a few years back...

17:25.890 --> 17:27.607
another class-action case.

17:27.642 --> 17:29.392
Kind of a new thing for us.

17:29.394 --> 17:31.394
Now, it's not exactly my go-to,

17:31.396 --> 17:33.729
but generally speaking, I'm open to it.

17:33.782 --> 17:35.364
We will talk next week.

17:35.400 --> 17:36.816
Great.

17:36.868 --> 17:39.235
Safe travels.

18:00.391 --> 18:01.691
If you or a family member

18:01.726 --> 18:02.959
have been diagnosed

18:02.994 --> 18:05.461
with mesothelioma or related conditions,

18:05.497 --> 18:08.397
you may be entitled to monetary damages.

18:08.433 --> 18:09.866
Mesothelioma is a rare lung disease,

18:09.901 --> 18:12.768
usually associated
with exposure to asbestos,

18:12.804 --> 18:14.337
a known human carcinogen.

18:14.372 --> 18:16.939
Long-term inhalation of asbestos fibers

18:16.941 --> 18:19.408
can cause serious or fatal illnesses,

18:19.444 --> 18:21.577
including malignant lung cancer,

18:21.613 --> 18:23.246
mesothelioma, and asbestosis.

18:23.281 --> 18:26.782
Remember they worked real hard
to get that just right.

18:26.784 --> 18:28.367
To get what just right?

18:28.419 --> 18:31.454
Oh, the... the swirl.

18:31.506 --> 18:34.290
They wanted it kind of nebulous,
but not too nebulous.

18:34.342 --> 18:36.425
Then there was the issue of the speed.

18:36.461 --> 18:39.128
I remember there were
a lot of meetings about that.

18:39.130 --> 18:40.763
victims and their families.

18:40.798 --> 18:41.764
I'll bet.

18:42.166 --> 18:45.785
call Davis & Main at 505-242-7700.

18:45.820 --> 18:49.722
That's 505-242-7700.

18:54.212 --> 18:57.213
Cliff signed off on this?

18:57.240 --> 18:59.524
The partners were very happy.

18:59.598 --> 19:01.848
What do you think?

19:01.900 --> 19:03.349
I think...

19:03.401 --> 19:07.570
whatever happened to showmanship?

19:10.442 --> 19:12.543
Yo, check it out.

19:12.629 --> 19:14.846
Ricola!

19:14.898 --> 19:15.863
Ricola!

19:15.899 --> 19:17.148
Hey!

19:17.150 --> 19:19.784
Will you two assclowns
act like the professionals

19:19.819 --> 19:21.786
your parents are paying for you to become?

19:21.821 --> 19:24.238
This happens to be very valuable.

19:24.290 --> 19:25.740
Yeah? What is it?

19:27.385 --> 19:30.252
This one is, uh, the Alpine Shepherd Boy.

19:30.285 --> 19:31.351
It's for her nephew.

19:31.373 --> 19:33.040
So, come... join me.

19:33.092 --> 19:35.042
Production meeting... bring it in.

19:35.078 --> 19:36.095
All right.

19:36.143 --> 19:39.052
Now, look, teamwork makes the dream work.

19:39.091 --> 19:40.808
Together, we can make something...

19:40.843 --> 19:42.643
dare I say it? Bravura.

19:43.233 --> 19:44.667
And this is a golden opportunity,

19:44.717 --> 19:45.683
especially for you guys,

19:45.740 --> 19:47.440
'cause it's gonna play
all around the Southwest,

19:47.492 --> 19:48.991
so who knows what it could lead to?

19:49.027 --> 19:50.660
It better lead to a hundred bucks each.

19:50.695 --> 19:51.994
What is it with you and money?

19:52.030 --> 19:53.579
Saving up for a VX2000.

19:53.615 --> 19:54.914
Hey, pop quiz...

19:54.949 --> 19:58.000
what do we three have in
common with the greats...

19:58.036 --> 20:01.170
Welles, Fellini, Bergman... the biggies?

20:01.206 --> 20:02.455
What?

20:02.507 --> 20:04.423
All three of them... to a man...

20:04.459 --> 20:06.292
worked in the highly lucrative,

20:06.294 --> 20:08.678
creatively rewarding field of advertising,

20:08.713 --> 20:10.847
and tonight, we join them.

20:10.882 --> 20:13.266
This is heady stuff, right?

20:13.301 --> 20:15.768
Okay. So, pay attention.

20:15.803 --> 20:19.355
We open on granny, and she is rocking.

20:19.390 --> 20:25.728
So she's back and forth,
just very back... and forth.

20:25.780 --> 20:29.982
And then, very slowly and smoothly,

20:30.034 --> 20:34.153
the camera, uh... moves towards her...

20:34.205 --> 20:36.489
- Dolly?
- A dolly... good.

20:36.541 --> 20:37.957
See a dolly here?

20:37.992 --> 20:39.575
You guys didn't bring a dolly?

20:39.627 --> 20:40.910
Nope, no dolly.

20:40.962 --> 20:42.912
You didn't ask for a dolly.

20:42.964 --> 20:45.331
- Gotta ask, dude. Dolly's extra.
- It's true.

20:45.383 --> 20:46.999
Okay, no dolly.

20:47.001 --> 20:49.502
Um...

20:49.504 --> 20:51.721
We will improvise, then.

20:51.756 --> 20:53.172
Stay with me.

20:53.174 --> 20:54.674
She's rocking.

20:54.726 --> 20:55.925
She's shivering.

20:58.513 --> 21:02.148
She's clutching at a tattered shawl.

21:04.452 --> 21:07.687
They turned the heat off on her,
these evil bastards.

21:08.856 --> 21:11.240
She's cold and hungry, she's friendless.

21:11.276 --> 21:15.244
This is heart-rending stuff, man.

21:15.280 --> 21:19.699
Okay, it's a oner, and it's shot
in glorious black and white.

21:19.751 --> 21:21.701
We can do that, right?

21:21.753 --> 21:22.752
Yeah.

21:24.339 --> 21:25.304
So that's it?

21:25.340 --> 21:26.872
Old lady in a chair?

21:26.925 --> 21:28.674
That's your commercial?

21:30.211 --> 21:32.878
Does anybody like you?

21:34.299 --> 21:37.850
I'm ready for my close-up, Mr. McGill.

22:28.486 --> 22:32.905
and an easy, easy pop fly off dead center.

22:35.576 --> 22:39.111
Murphy's gone 13 for 29
over his last 8 games,

22:39.163 --> 22:41.947
batting a blistering 343 overall,

22:41.949 --> 22:45.868
and now Lewis again working
quickly with the bench.

22:45.920 --> 22:47.870
Murphy swings, it's
a two-hopper into the crowd.

22:47.922 --> 22:49.088
Foul ball.

24:27.722 --> 24:32.224
Have a good one.

24:57.301 --> 24:59.251
Hey, honey. What's happening?

25:00.254 --> 25:01.754
What's wrong?

25:02.757 --> 25:05.591
What happened?

25:18.439 --> 25:20.739
- Where's Kaylee?
- She's at school. She's fine.

25:20.775 --> 25:24.026
She doesn't know about it.
Are you all right?

25:24.078 --> 25:25.277
Let me show you.

25:27.365 --> 25:30.499
It's up... it's up there.

25:30.535 --> 25:32.001
You see it?

25:32.036 --> 25:34.670
It's right up there.

25:34.705 --> 25:35.921
You see that?

25:35.957 --> 25:38.123
You see the shape of it?

25:38.176 --> 25:40.176
You do see it, right?

25:40.211 --> 25:41.510
I... I see it.

25:41.546 --> 25:44.964
What time did you hear the shots?

25:44.966 --> 25:46.849
2:13 this morning.

25:46.884 --> 25:49.268
I looked at the clock. It was three of them.

25:49.303 --> 25:51.020
It was exactly like last time.

25:51.055 --> 25:52.688
And you didn't call the police. Or did you?

25:52.723 --> 25:54.306
No, I...

25:54.308 --> 25:57.059
What's the point?

25:58.863 --> 26:02.031
Uh... I'm thinking outside the box, but...

26:02.066 --> 26:05.818
you think maybe it's possible
that you dreamed it?

26:05.870 --> 26:07.486
It happens sometimes.

26:07.538 --> 26:09.205
I didn't dream it, Mike.

26:09.240 --> 26:11.790
Because I didn't sleep a wink last night.

26:11.826 --> 26:13.492
That came from a bullet.

26:13.544 --> 26:15.044
I mean, it must have.

26:15.079 --> 26:16.795
It wasn't there before last night.

26:16.831 --> 26:18.714
I promise you that, and I don't know...

26:18.749 --> 26:19.915
Okay.

26:19.967 --> 26:23.903
Okay. Jesus...

26:23.938 --> 26:25.221
I mean, I was here.

26:25.256 --> 26:27.006
I was here, and you weren't.

26:27.008 --> 26:28.724
I believe you.

26:30.978 --> 26:32.711
I believe you.

26:36.851 --> 26:39.852
All right. That's it.

26:39.854 --> 26:43.355
We're getting you and Kaylee
out of this house.

26:43.357 --> 26:46.408
End of story.

27:05.262 --> 27:07.196
You ever wonder about these things?

27:07.231 --> 27:08.531
What things?

27:08.566 --> 27:10.866
This. Like, what's the story with these?

27:10.902 --> 27:12.785
Who was it who first said,

27:12.820 --> 27:15.237
"Hey, I know... big bowl of balls."

27:15.239 --> 27:18.140
I don't know. They came with the place.

27:18.175 --> 27:19.408
No shit.

27:19.460 --> 27:21.877
They're in every corporate
apartment in the world.

27:21.913 --> 27:23.879
They're like the Gideon Bible.

27:23.915 --> 27:26.215
Hey, don't be jealous
of my big bowl of balls.

27:26.250 --> 27:27.466
It's unbecoming.

27:27.501 --> 27:30.502
Why do they all have to have empty vases?

27:30.555 --> 27:32.154
Well, it's the law.

27:32.189 --> 27:35.007
Plus, it's a metaphor.

27:35.059 --> 27:36.175
I got to say,

27:36.227 --> 27:38.227
I will miss the nail salon's
vibrating chairs.

27:38.262 --> 27:39.311
Well, for you,

27:39.347 --> 27:41.847
I can make any chair in this place vibrate.

27:43.017 --> 27:45.100
You ready for this?

27:46.487 --> 27:48.354
Kay. Here goes.

27:48.406 --> 27:49.605
You're 86 years old.

27:49.607 --> 27:51.824
You're a resident of Sandpiper,
Colorado Springs.

27:51.859 --> 27:54.360
You just finished your
afternoon snack, lime Jell-O.

27:54.412 --> 27:55.678
Lime, got it.

27:55.713 --> 27:56.879
You're in the dayroom,

27:56.914 --> 27:58.847
you're watching your favorite TV program.

27:58.883 --> 27:59.949
What's this?

27:59.984 --> 28:01.517
There's been another murder in Cabot Cove?

28:01.552 --> 28:02.518
No!

28:02.553 --> 28:03.702
Yes.

28:03.754 --> 28:05.421
The sheriff is in over his head,
and once again,

28:05.456 --> 28:07.256
Jessica Fletcher has to put aside

28:07.291 --> 28:10.092
the novel she's been writing
and assist law enforcement.

28:10.127 --> 28:11.293
Shocker!

28:11.345 --> 28:15.631
The killer left behind
a cryptogram... and commercial.

28:24.191 --> 28:27.726
My husband and I scrimped
and saved for so many years.

28:27.778 --> 28:30.229
We did our best to build a nest egg

28:30.281 --> 28:33.315
so that we wouldn't be a burden
to our family.

28:33.367 --> 28:37.319
After Ronald passed, I moved to
an assisted-living facility...

28:37.371 --> 28:38.654
a nice place.

28:38.706 --> 28:41.790
They told me they'd take care of everything,

28:41.826 --> 28:45.494
but then, one day, they said
all my money was gone.

28:45.546 --> 28:47.713
How could that be?

28:47.748 --> 28:50.132
Where did it all go?

28:51.552 --> 28:53.585
- That's not a real tear, is it?
- It's Visine.

28:53.638 --> 28:55.738
is a resident of
a Sandpiper Crossing facility

28:55.773 --> 28:58.340
or other associated retirement community,

28:58.392 --> 29:01.176
you may be eligible to receive compensation.

29:01.178 --> 29:02.678
For a free consultation,

29:02.730 --> 29:08.400
call the law offices of
Davis & Main at 505-242-7700.

29:08.436 --> 29:11.904
That's 505-242-7700.

29:14.742 --> 29:18.027
Well?

29:18.079 --> 29:19.361
You made that?

29:19.363 --> 29:21.864
With... some film students?

29:21.866 --> 29:22.948
I directed.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.584
It looks... professional.

29:26.921 --> 29:28.120
And?

29:28.172 --> 29:32.124
And if I were an 86-year-old
Sandpiper resident...

29:32.176 --> 29:33.709
I'd be dialing.

29:33.711 --> 29:35.678
Yes.

29:35.713 --> 29:36.945
Up top.

29:36.981 --> 29:40.382
And all made in accordance
with the rules and regulations

29:40.384 --> 29:42.518
of the American Bar Association.

29:42.553 --> 29:43.886
Good.

29:48.392 --> 29:51.527
I can't believe Davis & Main went for it.

29:51.562 --> 29:53.312
Well...

29:53.364 --> 29:55.314
I'm in charge of the department.

29:55.366 --> 29:58.534
Yeah, but still, you know,
Cliff Main was fine with this.

29:59.737 --> 30:01.487
Why wouldn't he be?

30:01.539 --> 30:04.239
No, it's... it's fantastic.

30:05.242 --> 30:06.241
Let's celebrate.

30:06.293 --> 30:07.710
I'm getting more wine. You want some?

30:07.745 --> 30:10.379
Absolutely.

31:13.360 --> 31:15.360
Very good.

31:15.396 --> 31:17.479
Thank you.

31:24.155 --> 31:26.655
Colorado Springs, Colorado.

31:26.657 --> 31:31.076
Yeah, I'd like the number
for KKTV, channel 11.

31:32.246 --> 31:34.329
Omar, what's the cutoff for FedEx?

31:34.331 --> 31:36.715
I need to get a package out, tout suite.

31:36.750 --> 31:38.133
Oh.

31:38.169 --> 31:41.720
Uh, yes, can you connect me
to your ad sales department?

31:41.755 --> 31:43.438
Thanks.

31:43.474 --> 31:45.808
Gums look good, no recession.

31:45.843 --> 31:47.426
Tongue looks good, too.

31:47.478 --> 31:49.228
Eyes are clear.

31:49.263 --> 31:50.929
This little lady's in fine fettle.

31:50.981 --> 31:53.732
We can have one of the girls
trim her nails, if you like.

31:53.767 --> 31:55.017
No, some other time.

31:56.770 --> 31:58.770
What do you got for me?

31:58.823 --> 32:02.107
Bodyguard job, 200 bucks.

32:02.159 --> 32:03.192
What else?

32:03.194 --> 32:06.612
For you, that's the best fit I've got.

32:11.085 --> 32:12.784
I know a loan shark.

32:12.837 --> 32:15.537
Always needs enforcement and recovery.

32:15.589 --> 32:18.006
Pays good, and it's steady work.

32:18.042 --> 32:19.341
Most of the time,

32:19.376 --> 32:22.761
we're just talking intimidation,
strictly verbal.

32:22.796 --> 32:25.013
"Most of the time."

32:25.049 --> 32:26.715
I'm not breaking legs.

32:26.717 --> 32:27.883
What else?

32:29.436 --> 32:33.222
Look, we discussed this.

32:33.224 --> 32:36.191
You want next-level pay,
you got to do next-level work.

32:36.227 --> 32:38.460
I respect where you're
coming from on this thing.

32:38.495 --> 32:39.561
I do.

32:39.563 --> 32:42.447
But that's just how it goes.

32:46.570 --> 32:48.620
All right.

32:48.656 --> 32:51.490
She's gonna need a DHPP shot, six months.

32:51.542 --> 32:54.326
We'll send you a reminder card.

32:54.378 --> 32:55.410
Till then.

32:56.780 --> 32:58.447
Give me the bodyguard job.

32:59.500 --> 33:01.750
For $200?

33:03.804 --> 33:08.223
Call you with the where and the when.

33:42.942 --> 33:44.275
So, everybody knows...

33:44.371 --> 33:45.570
They know.

33:45.622 --> 33:47.072
Every line starting with 7700

33:47.148 --> 33:49.682
has been rerouted to
the bullpen, plus your office.

33:49.730 --> 33:51.679
All the assistants know to keep them open.

33:51.732 --> 33:53.815
So, if you're on a call
and another call comes in,

33:53.850 --> 33:56.017
the call doesn't go
to an answering machine, right?

33:56.069 --> 33:57.352
Because... very important...

33:57.404 --> 33:59.154
old people don't like talking to robots.

33:59.189 --> 34:01.439
If I'm on a call and another call comes in,

34:01.491 --> 34:02.941
it'll roll over to Maida.

34:02.993 --> 34:05.110
After that, Iris will get the next one,

34:05.162 --> 34:06.911
then Julian, and then Barbara,

34:06.947 --> 34:09.864
and Yvonne, right on down the line.

34:09.916 --> 34:10.949
Good.

34:11.001 --> 34:13.451
Let's make that the plan, then.

34:13.453 --> 34:15.620
Oh, so...

34:15.672 --> 34:17.539
What time do you have?

34:17.591 --> 34:19.206
Uh, quarter after.

34:19.259 --> 34:21.760
It should be running now, right?

34:24.681 --> 34:27.215
Is there... anything else?

34:27.266 --> 34:29.384
No. Thanks.

34:29.436 --> 34:34.522
It's... I'll just... be in my office.

34:38.862 --> 34:41.646
Come on.

34:55.161 --> 34:57.996
Come on.

34:58.048 --> 35:01.382
Come on, Colorado Springs, come on.

35:22.130 --> 35:23.632
Good afternoon,
Davis & Main, attorneys at law.

35:23.717 --> 35:25.951
How may I help you?

35:26.359 --> 35:28.393
Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am, that is unfortunate.

35:29.596 --> 35:31.663
Now, to get your case started,
may I ask for a name

35:31.698 --> 35:33.364
and the number for one
of our attorneys to reach you?

35:33.400 --> 35:35.066
Good afternoon.
Davis & Main, attorneys at law.

35:35.101 --> 35:36.801
How can I help you?

35:36.837 --> 35:38.136
Yes, that is correct.

35:38.171 --> 35:40.805
Good afternoon,
Davis & Main, attorneys at law.

35:45.712 --> 35:47.429
Good afternoon, Davis & Main.

35:47.441 --> 35:48.891
Sandpiper hotline.

35:48.943 --> 35:50.742
How can I help you?

35:50.778 --> 35:52.027
We'll get back to you.

35:52.062 --> 35:53.112
Yes, ma'am.

35:53.147 --> 35:54.480
We'll be happy to send an information packet

35:54.482 --> 35:55.481
right out to you.

35:55.533 --> 35:58.066
May I ask, are you currently a resident

35:58.119 --> 36:00.319
of a Sandpiper Crossing facility?

36:02.323 --> 36:03.281
Good afternoon. Davis & Main.

36:03.282 --> 36:04.239
Good afternoon. Davis & Main,
attorneys at law.

36:04.291 --> 36:05.457
Bingo.

36:05.493 --> 36:07.876
And you're currently a resident...

36:48.165 --> 36:50.760
Yeah.

36:51.366 --> 36:52.884
Something came in this evening,

36:53.413 --> 36:56.013
and it's definitely next-level pay.

36:56.049 --> 36:57.298
Yeah?

36:57.333 --> 37:00.217
It's probably a long shot,
given your selectivity.

37:02.088 --> 37:03.137
What's the job?

37:03.172 --> 37:05.756
I asked. Guy wouldn't tell me.

37:05.758 --> 37:08.926
But whatever it is, it's serious money.

37:08.928 --> 37:10.177
And the guy...

37:10.229 --> 37:14.265
he specifically asked for you.

37:14.317 --> 37:17.835
And who's the guy?

37:17.870 --> 37:18.969
I can't hold it, sir.

37:19.005 --> 37:20.771
No control on the planes, Captain.

37:20.807 --> 37:22.239
We're going down and fast.

37:22.275 --> 37:24.108
"We're going down and fast."

37:24.143 --> 37:25.142
Check this out.

37:25.178 --> 37:26.377
This is a good part.

37:26.412 --> 37:28.412
So, do they all die? Tell me that much.

37:28.448 --> 37:29.980
Shh, shh, shh, shh!

37:30.016 --> 37:33.384
Does Rock Hudson run 'em into an iceberg?

37:35.455 --> 37:39.857
Is this... Before or after
he did "McMillan & Wife"?

37:39.892 --> 37:42.927
Shut up. Watch the movie.

37:45.364 --> 37:46.964
What is this weird fascination you have

37:46.999 --> 37:50.101
with stories of men trapped
on the North Pole?

37:50.136 --> 37:52.970
"Ice Station Zebra" is on the North Pole.

37:52.972 --> 37:54.155
"The Thing" takes place on the South Pole.

37:54.159 --> 37:56.242
They literally could not
be any more different.

37:56.244 --> 37:58.211
My dad loves this one.

37:58.246 --> 38:00.496
Yeah, him and Howard Hughes.

38:00.548 --> 38:02.749
I know, right?

38:02.801 --> 38:05.752
Can't get two finer reviews than that.

38:05.754 --> 38:07.804
How much pressure's left
in the air banks?

38:07.839 --> 38:09.756
Down 800 pounds, sir.

38:09.758 --> 38:13.226
Secure after group blow.

38:16.514 --> 38:18.598
Mnh-mnh!

38:18.650 --> 38:19.982
It's the boss.

38:20.018 --> 38:21.267
At this hour?

38:21.319 --> 38:22.351
Yeah.

38:22.404 --> 38:25.571
It's never too late for congratulations.

38:27.358 --> 38:30.777
Cliff, Jesus, you're still at the office?

38:30.829 --> 38:33.362
You ran a commercial?

38:33.415 --> 38:35.531
Yeah, and, oh, my God,

38:35.583 --> 38:37.366
let me tell you, the response has been...

38:37.419 --> 38:39.869
You ran a commercial
without ever showing it to me,

38:39.921 --> 38:41.537
without first consulting me and my partners.

38:41.589 --> 38:43.840
Did you actually think that was gonna fly?!

38:43.875 --> 38:46.259
I was planning on telling you
in the morning.

38:46.294 --> 38:47.710
The day after it aired?!

38:47.762 --> 38:51.047
I only ran it once,
just in one small market.

38:51.099 --> 38:52.882
It was kind of an experiment, all right?

38:52.934 --> 38:54.767
Kind of under the radar.

38:54.803 --> 38:56.185
And in all fairness,

38:56.221 --> 38:59.522
you did tell me client outreach
was my department.

38:59.557 --> 39:01.057
Don't be disingenuous.

39:01.109 --> 39:05.394
This commercial... I take it
my firm's name is mentioned?

39:05.447 --> 39:07.980
Yes. Yeah.

39:08.032 --> 39:09.065
Jesus...

39:09.117 --> 39:10.650
Howard said you were a little eccentric.

39:10.702 --> 39:13.052
He didn't tell me
you were a goddamn arsonist!

39:13.087 --> 39:16.489
Cliff, to be fair, I don't think, uh...

39:18.037 --> 39:19.449
Uh...

39:19.755 --> 39:20.642
I apologize if there was any misreading

39:20.712 --> 39:23.329
of the situation on my part,

39:23.381 --> 39:25.498
but there's a very positive headline here.

39:25.550 --> 39:28.417
We got 103 phone calls today,

39:28.470 --> 39:30.419
off a measly $700 ad buy.

39:30.472 --> 39:33.089
Now that kind of return
on investment you can't g...

39:33.141 --> 39:35.842
Tomorrow morning, 8:00,
my office, with the partners,

39:35.894 --> 39:37.477
and we want to see this thing.

39:37.512 --> 39:40.880
Cliff, when you see this, I know you'll...

39:45.453 --> 39:47.403
Yeah, Cliff.

39:48.773 --> 39:49.822
Thank you.

39:49.858 --> 39:51.524
Yeah, you, too.

39:51.576 --> 39:52.525
Okay.

39:52.577 --> 39:55.695
See ya.

39:55.747 --> 39:57.613
Golden boy.

39:57.665 --> 39:59.365
That's me.

40:05.039 --> 40:06.539
So, what'd I miss?

40:06.541 --> 40:08.207
Anything blow up yet?

41:11.606 --> 41:14.106
Feeling cautious?

41:15.860 --> 41:19.412
You gonna tell me what we're doing here?

41:19.647 --> 41:21.581
I've got a problem.

41:21.616 --> 41:23.866
- Okay.
- This problem...

41:23.918 --> 41:26.619
I can't solve it myself.

41:26.621 --> 41:30.506
This problem... is it a who or a what?

41:32.093 --> 41:34.293
There's a guy.

41:36.297 --> 41:39.849
I need him to go away.

41:40.305 --> 41:46.288
