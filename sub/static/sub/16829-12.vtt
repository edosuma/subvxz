WEBVTT

00:08.376 --> 00:10.676
Girl:
E-excuse me.

00:10.678 --> 00:13.145
Hi, sweetheart,
are you okay?

00:13.147 --> 00:15.347
I... I can't find my mom.

00:15.349 --> 00:17.216
We got separated on our hike.

00:17.218 --> 00:19.385
It's okay.
We're gonna find her.

00:19.387 --> 00:21.520
I'm joanne.
What's your name?

00:21.522 --> 00:23.188
Paige.

00:23.190 --> 00:25.290
That's a pretty name.

00:25.292 --> 00:29.228
We're gonna start at the head
of the trail, all right?

00:29.230 --> 00:31.296
Come on.

00:44.745 --> 00:47.413
Oh, nice work, cutie.

00:47.415 --> 00:49.448
Cabe:
<i> Mr. dodd,</i>

00:49.450 --> 00:51.784
parking in west altadenia
is atrocious.

00:51.786 --> 00:53.252
How are you going to improve it?

00:53.254 --> 00:54.453
Since I ride the bus,

00:54.455 --> 00:56.288
I think a logical option

00:56.290 --> 00:59.258
would be for more people
to use public transportation.

00:59.260 --> 01:01.193
My opponent is a dork.
I win.

01:01.195 --> 01:03.662
What? I answered
everything honestly.

01:03.664 --> 01:05.731
Honesty will get you points
at the pearly gates--

01:05.733 --> 01:07.766
in politics,
it gets you crushed.

01:09.070 --> 01:10.335
Hello, everybody.

01:10.337 --> 01:11.437
Sylvester:
Veronica.

01:11.439 --> 01:13.172
Hi. You're here.

01:13.174 --> 01:14.673
Just for a bit.

01:14.675 --> 01:16.341
Oh, is this debate prep
for the alderman election?

01:16.343 --> 01:18.177
Yeah, if you can
call it that.

01:18.179 --> 01:20.279
So, who've you been
on the run from?

01:20.281 --> 01:22.548
Funny. A business deal
jumped off quick,

01:22.550 --> 01:25.084
and I just had to hit the road
before saying good-bye.

01:25.086 --> 01:27.252
And couldn't be
contacted for weeks.

01:27.254 --> 01:30.189
Is Paige here?

01:30.191 --> 01:32.791
She's dropping your grandson
off at school.

01:32.793 --> 01:35.761
Well, I'm sure she's mad at me
for disappearing, but you know,

01:35.763 --> 01:37.196
when opportunity arises,

01:37.198 --> 01:38.530
you just have to reach out
and grab it.

01:38.532 --> 01:41.667
Entrepreneurship is what
makes this country great.

01:41.669 --> 01:43.268
When it comes to debate prep,

01:43.270 --> 01:44.703
there's a lot you could learn
from this woman.

01:44.705 --> 01:48.140
All I've heard is obfuscation.
Exactamundo.

01:48.142 --> 01:50.642
First of all, sly,
you should always redirect.

01:50.644 --> 01:51.710
Answer the question

01:51.712 --> 01:53.278
you wish had been asked

01:53.280 --> 01:54.279
instead of the one that was.

01:54.281 --> 01:55.180
Cabe:
Like when Allie asked me

01:55.182 --> 01:56.548
if I liked vegan food.

01:56.550 --> 01:57.683
I said yes.

01:57.685 --> 01:59.651
I like broccoli and carrots.

01:59.653 --> 02:02.254
I just left out that I like them
next to a steak.

02:02.256 --> 02:04.389
That sounds like a lie.

02:04.391 --> 02:05.457
No, it's a pivot.

02:05.459 --> 02:07.326
I will admit
that it has forced me

02:07.328 --> 02:10.762
to supplement my protein intake
with a lot of jerky.

02:10.764 --> 02:12.264
Yes, I have noticed.

02:17.271 --> 02:17.920
(Horn blowing)

02:17.921 --> 02:18.570
Everyone, everything is
about to change for the better.

02:18.572 --> 02:20.439
Oh, look who's back.

02:20.441 --> 02:22.207
So, Paige will be very...
Interested.

02:22.209 --> 02:24.209
About Paige, I really
need to talk with her.

02:24.211 --> 02:25.444
Do you...
Eh, not until
you have the conch.

02:25.446 --> 02:27.357
Oh, boy.

02:27.358 --> 02:29.269
In the wake
of Tim's recent departure,

02:29.270 --> 02:31.181
it was made clear to me
that my decision-making

02:31.185 --> 02:32.284
could be a bit, um...

02:32.286 --> 02:33.352
Tyrannical.

02:33.354 --> 02:34.520
I was gonna say unilateral,

02:34.522 --> 02:37.556
but your input is
heard and appreciated.

02:37.558 --> 02:40.792
Overcompensation by way of
agreeability and inclusion.

02:40.794 --> 02:42.561
Got it.
Wrong.

02:43.597 --> 02:45.230
But appreciated.
Anyway, we're a team.

02:45.232 --> 02:46.498
Everyone's feelings
should be heard,

02:46.500 --> 02:48.117
not just mine.

02:48.118 --> 02:49.735
Anyone that graduated middle
school knows the conch method.

02:49.737 --> 02:51.436
It's from<i> lord of the flies.</i>

02:51.438 --> 02:53.472
You know this'll flame out

02:53.474 --> 02:55.307
when you eventually snap
like a rubber band;

02:55.309 --> 02:56.542
being genial isn't your nature.

02:56.544 --> 02:58.544
That's wrong,
and, uh, appreciated.

02:58.546 --> 03:00.913
Since today's case
is relatively simple,

03:00.915 --> 03:04.249
I figured we could implement,
uh, a soft tryout?

03:04.251 --> 03:06.485
Transportation for
crooning crane winery

03:06.487 --> 03:07.486
will be here very soon.

03:07.488 --> 03:08.720
We have a private job

03:08.722 --> 03:10.856
to revamp their
viticulture technology

03:10.858 --> 03:12.791
with selective harvesters
and optical sorters.

03:12.793 --> 03:14.726
Can I have the
shell? Please.

03:14.728 --> 03:16.461
Uh, real quick.
Wait.

03:16.463 --> 03:18.397
Happy:
Uh, Toby and I

03:18.399 --> 03:20.432
forgot my model for
the sap flow sensors.

03:20.434 --> 03:22.534
What? The client's minutes away.

03:23.537 --> 03:27.472
But, uh, I'm sure
there's a good reason.

03:27.474 --> 03:29.575
Uh, we were awake all night

03:29.577 --> 03:30.542
in a wedding venue rabbit hole.

03:30.544 --> 03:32.578
In other words,
we spaced,

03:32.580 --> 03:34.780
but we'll get it and
we'll meet you at the winery.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.717
Thank you.
So, I need to...

03:38.719 --> 03:41.520
The client. I'm sorry.

03:41.522 --> 03:42.738
Miss Walker.

03:42.739 --> 03:43.955
Paige will be
with us in a minute,

03:43.958 --> 03:45.857
and Toby and happy will be
joining us at the winery.

03:45.859 --> 03:48.827
But we provided transportation
for the whole team,

03:48.829 --> 03:52.598
so everyone could sample
the wines before arriving.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.600
Mm, adding roughly ten percent
to our overall job time.

03:54.602 --> 03:58.537
So, how about a ten percent
discount in our fee?

03:59.506 --> 04:01.273
I just need
to make a quick call.

04:01.275 --> 04:03.642
Of course.

04:03.644 --> 04:04.943
(Clears throat)
Walter, the conch?

04:05.913 --> 04:08.313
Yup.

04:08.315 --> 04:09.615
Veronica:
I have to talk to Paige

04:09.617 --> 04:11.250
for a few minutes
before you leave.

04:11.252 --> 04:14.553
I hear you, but the client
is already testy.

04:16.557 --> 04:18.423
Oh, I may have a solution.

04:18.425 --> 04:20.659
My bad. I hit so much...

04:21.495 --> 04:23.962
...traffic.

04:23.964 --> 04:25.697
What if I said it's
bring your mom to work day?

04:25.699 --> 04:28.267
Paige:
<i> I'd say that</i>

04:28.269 --> 04:29.434
it doesn't exist.

04:29.436 --> 04:30.636
I'd ask you where
you've been,

04:30.638 --> 04:31.870
but I'd just get a lie.

04:31.872 --> 04:33.405
So, why are you here?

04:33.407 --> 04:34.873
I'm just hitching a ride
to the vineyard,

04:34.875 --> 04:36.475
then I'm gonna get a cab
to the airport.

04:36.477 --> 04:38.543
Paige: Skipping town.
I expect you to disappear,

04:38.545 --> 04:40.512
but I can't forgive you
for doing that to Ralph.

04:40.514 --> 04:41.880
I'm gonna make it
up to him, honey.

04:41.882 --> 04:43.615
That's why I'm here. I...
Paige: Don't.

04:43.617 --> 04:46.618
I'll tell him you said good-bye.
Just leave. Okay?

04:46.620 --> 04:47.686
Cabe: Why don't you
have a drink, kid?

04:47.688 --> 04:49.921
It'll take the edge off.

04:54.762 --> 04:57.829
As my Italian forebears
would say...

04:59.566 --> 05:00.666
Cabe.

05:00.668 --> 05:03.635
What? I give
a healthy pour.

05:03.637 --> 05:04.837
Veronica:
What was the name

05:04.838 --> 05:06.038
of the guy who
hated the smurfs?

05:06.040 --> 05:07.372
Gargamel.

05:07.374 --> 05:08.540
Oh, I think he's driving

05:08.542 --> 05:10.375
that SUV right there.

05:10.377 --> 05:11.643
Look.

05:15.616 --> 05:18.650
Guys, we're being drugged.

05:18.652 --> 05:20.819
No, we're just
getting liquored up.
Yeah.

05:20.821 --> 05:23.522
(Both laugh)

05:23.524 --> 05:25.524
No, smell it.
The air, it smells sweet.

05:25.526 --> 05:27.359
It's kevloturane.

05:27.361 --> 05:28.393
It's a subtle knockout gas.

05:28.395 --> 05:29.895
Maybe we should all take a nap.

05:29.897 --> 05:32.631
W-w-we're moments away
from being unconscious.

05:32.633 --> 05:35.000
Here. It won't budge.

05:35.002 --> 05:36.835
Paige:
Locked.

05:36.837 --> 05:38.904
I got this.
No, no, no,
no, no, no.

05:38.906 --> 05:40.639
Kevloturane is flammable.

05:40.641 --> 05:42.374
If a bullet creates a spark,

05:42.376 --> 05:44.976
then the limo will explode.

05:44.978 --> 05:47.112
Why don't we all pop corks
of the champagne bottles

05:47.114 --> 05:48.580
at a single window?

05:48.582 --> 05:50.549
Okay.
Yes! Yes. Okay.

05:50.551 --> 05:52.718
Shake the bottles
to build up pressure,

05:52.720 --> 05:54.386
and then release the
corks at every corner

05:54.388 --> 05:56.555
of the windows.
Are you ready? On three.

05:56.557 --> 05:58.123
One...

05:58.125 --> 05:59.091
Two...

05:59.093 --> 06:00.525
(Bottles clanking)

06:11.705 --> 06:12.938
(Groans softly)

06:16.110 --> 06:17.109
(Walter mumbles)

06:17.111 --> 06:18.377
Oh.

06:28.655 --> 06:30.572
Where the hell are we?

06:30.573 --> 06:32.490
Cabe: Somewhere we're not
getting out of without happy.

06:32.493 --> 06:35.127
Look. Card reader.

06:35.129 --> 06:37.629
<i> "No fumar."</i>

06:37.631 --> 06:38.864
<i> "Agua."</i>

06:38.866 --> 06:40.432
Spanish?

06:40.434 --> 06:41.967
I'm not sure that we're
in the United States.

06:41.969 --> 06:43.435
Look, central
American outlets.

06:43.437 --> 06:44.436
Someone drugged us

06:44.438 --> 06:45.604
and flew us out of the country?

06:46.573 --> 06:48.740
They took our wallets
and our phones.

06:48.742 --> 06:50.642
Okay, list of central
American countries

06:50.644 --> 06:52.511
with three and a half hour
flight time from Los Angeles.

06:54.915 --> 06:56.081
Walter:
Look.

06:56.083 --> 06:58.183
High-end printing press...

06:58.185 --> 07:00.952
And recently printed sheets

07:00.954 --> 07:02.554
of U.S. $100 bills.

07:02.556 --> 07:04.623
This is a counterfeiting
operation?

07:04.625 --> 07:05.690
What do they want with us?

07:05.692 --> 07:07.926
Oh, no.
We're being set up.

07:07.928 --> 07:10.195
Did you have something
to do with this?

07:10.196 --> 07:12.463
Absolutely not...
As far as I know.

07:12.466 --> 07:13.799
This team gets
into a lot of trouble,

07:13.801 --> 07:14.900
but we never get kidnapped.

07:14.902 --> 07:15.901
Toby got kidnapped.

07:15.903 --> 07:17.636
We don't get kidnapped en masse.

07:17.638 --> 07:18.703
Okay.

07:18.705 --> 07:20.739
El Salvador, Guatemala...

07:21.708 --> 07:23.909
Oh, I hope it's not norteguay.

07:23.911 --> 07:27.112
Well, that's just bad
as north Korea.

07:27.114 --> 07:29.014
And norteguay's been rattling
their sabers at the U.S.

07:29.016 --> 07:30.916
Ever since that last round
of sanctions.

07:30.918 --> 07:33.485
Threatening to kidnap
our scarediest geeks?

07:33.487 --> 07:35.587
Cabe: But their threats
are nonspecific,

07:35.589 --> 07:36.822
and their dictator,
Alejandro durante,

07:36.824 --> 07:38.791
he calls them
"earth-shattering."

07:38.792 --> 07:40.759
Now, he's the kind of guy,
he starves his own people.

07:40.761 --> 07:42.694
He feeds his enemies
to his killer dogs.

07:44.465 --> 07:46.665
(Whispering): Oh, god,
i hope it's not norteguay.

07:46.667 --> 07:47.766
(Electronic beep)

07:50.537 --> 07:51.736
Lucinda?

07:51.738 --> 07:54.172
What exactly is going on?

07:57.010 --> 08:01.746
On behalf of our beloved leader,
i welcome you to norteguay.

08:05.185 --> 08:06.751
Oh, boy.

08:06.753 --> 08:08.820
♪ ♪

08:17.030 --> 08:18.864
You've been brought here
to rectify the damage

08:18.866 --> 08:20.799
norteguay has suffered
from crippling U.S. sanctions.

08:20.801 --> 08:22.601
Your own guy caused that,
not us.

08:22.603 --> 08:24.503
My brother, president durante,

08:24.505 --> 08:25.704
is not the problem.

08:25.706 --> 08:27.072
His mission is to reclaim

08:27.074 --> 08:28.507
the glory of norteguay,

08:28.509 --> 08:32.611
using the same means
by which it was stolen.

08:32.613 --> 08:36.047
The U.S. denied you dollars,
so you're gonna make fake ones.

08:36.049 --> 08:37.516
You'll finish creating
half a billion

08:37.518 --> 08:39.584
in counterfeit American dollars.

08:41.288 --> 08:42.687
Lucinda:
When you're done,

08:42.689 --> 08:44.139
you'll be released.

08:44.140 --> 08:45.590
I'm not sure
I'm buying that.

08:45.592 --> 08:47.592
Finish? Who's the guy
that started them?

08:48.595 --> 08:50.929
Wait...
Anders Dietrich.

08:50.931 --> 08:52.697
Swiss professor of criminology

08:52.699 --> 08:54.699
who specialized
in counterfeiting.

08:54.701 --> 08:56.201
He disappeared a month ago
at his office

08:56.203 --> 08:57.836
at the university
of Geneva.

08:57.838 --> 08:59.638
Probably took the same
limo ride as us.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.706
Where is he now?

09:01.708 --> 09:02.874
The professor was unable
to replicate

09:02.876 --> 09:05.176
the American bill's
newest innovations,

09:05.178 --> 09:07.746
the 3-d holographic strip
and the varnish seal.

09:07.748 --> 09:09.714
His memory should serve

09:09.716 --> 09:12.284
as a motivator not to fail
at those two tasks.

09:12.286 --> 09:14.853
His memory...

09:14.855 --> 09:16.121
We're not counterfeiters.

09:16.123 --> 09:18.156
According to dark site
discussions

09:18.158 --> 09:20.759
you expertly faked
un ID badges

09:20.761 --> 09:23.228
and created an exact
3D-printed replica

09:23.230 --> 09:26.031
of a 2,000-year-old ceremonial
bowl from Djibouti.

09:26.033 --> 09:28.233
Now, if you're uncapable,

09:28.235 --> 09:30.769
we have bullets
with your names on them.

09:30.771 --> 09:32.237
Guilty as charged.

09:32.239 --> 09:33.738
We make 'em, we fake 'em,

09:33.740 --> 09:35.273
we turn 'em over to you,
you take 'em.

09:35.275 --> 09:37.225
That's our motto.

09:37.226 --> 09:39.176
Start copying and printing
the holographic strips.

09:39.179 --> 09:40.879
When the rest
of your team arrives,

09:40.881 --> 09:43.582
Dr. Curtis will balance
the biochemical dyes

09:43.584 --> 09:44.916
for the phosphorous varnish.

09:44.918 --> 09:48.053
And your engineer will configure
the plates.

09:48.055 --> 09:50.722
Which means they're on their way
or you haven't caught them.

09:50.724 --> 09:53.892
And if you haven't, good luck.

09:53.894 --> 09:55.794
They'll be here soon.

09:55.796 --> 09:59.798
So get the job done
or your non-geniuses die.

09:59.800 --> 10:03.935
You're not gonna kill
a U.S. federal agent,

10:03.937 --> 10:06.338
and Paige is the only way
these guys can function.

10:06.340 --> 10:08.173
And without me,

10:08.175 --> 10:09.774
you're going
to be printing bills

10:09.776 --> 10:11.343
that even a clerk at
the 7-Eleven could spot.

10:11.345 --> 10:14.713
You?
You're the one I kill first.

10:14.715 --> 10:17.782
Really? Because your phosphorous
varnish won't work.

10:17.784 --> 10:19.718
The U.S. government
says publicly

10:19.720 --> 10:21.252
that's what it uses,
but it's a red herring.

10:21.254 --> 10:22.954
You need hydroquinone.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.122
Mom.

10:24.124 --> 10:26.191
They seem to know what
they're talking about.

10:26.193 --> 10:28.727
The phosphorous
looks good at first,

10:28.729 --> 10:30.395
but it dries sticky.

10:30.397 --> 10:33.365
Uh, feel free to look up
my criminal record.

10:33.367 --> 10:35.367
I served ten months
for counterfeiting

10:35.369 --> 10:36.801
perfect copper mine deeds.

10:36.803 --> 10:38.937
Couldn't be prouder.

10:38.939 --> 10:40.639
We can try your method.

10:40.641 --> 10:42.874
If it fails, you die.

10:44.244 --> 10:45.677
We have the chemicals
in another room.

10:45.679 --> 10:47.746
It's a two-woman job.

10:47.748 --> 10:50.215
Lucinda: If that press
isn't running within an hour,

10:50.217 --> 10:52.817
I'll send someone
to encourage you to work faster.

10:53.787 --> 10:54.953
You two, come.

10:54.955 --> 10:58.323
(Rapid beeps, latch opens)

11:06.366 --> 11:08.700
(Door closes)

11:09.803 --> 11:12.137
No windows, no vents,

11:12.139 --> 11:15.006
and a door
we don't have a card for.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.741
Maybe happy and Toby
didn't get captured,

11:16.743 --> 11:18.209
maybe they're looking for us.

11:18.211 --> 11:20.412
Maybe.

11:26.219 --> 11:27.886
That's puckish,
yet playful.

11:27.888 --> 11:29.821
Still no answer
from any of them.

11:29.823 --> 11:30.689
It's been three hours.

11:30.691 --> 11:31.723
(Woman clears throat)

11:31.725 --> 11:34.726
I'm sorry,
this is a no phone zone.

11:34.728 --> 11:36.027
If you want to tour the winery,

11:36.029 --> 11:37.862
you have to leave
your phones here.

11:37.864 --> 11:39.497
I'm sorry.

11:39.498 --> 11:41.131
This one isn't used to
classy places.

11:41.134 --> 11:44.002
(Burps)

11:45.806 --> 11:47.872
There could be a back up
on pch.

11:47.874 --> 11:49.841
Cell service sucks
by the cliffs.

11:49.843 --> 11:50.875
You know what I think?

11:50.877 --> 11:52.410
I think Wally

11:52.412 --> 11:54.079
isn't as conch-friendly
as he thinks he is.

11:54.081 --> 11:56.014
I think it burns his tuchas
that we weren't prepared

11:56.016 --> 11:57.532
for this job today.

11:57.533 --> 11:59.049
He had Lucinda take him
to that winery tasting room

11:59.052 --> 12:00.318
by Zuma beach.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.353
Petty punishments
aren't Walt's style.

12:02.355 --> 12:04.122
It's inefficient.

12:04.124 --> 12:05.757
Yeah, well, we're sitting here
like suckers.

12:05.759 --> 12:07.792
He's punishing us.

12:07.794 --> 12:08.760
You don't seem to mind
that much.

12:08.762 --> 12:11.296
(Gulps)
When in Rome.

12:11.298 --> 12:12.797
Why don't we<i> roam</i>

12:12.799 --> 12:13.965
around the grounds,

12:13.967 --> 12:15.333
check it out?

12:15.335 --> 12:17.936
Could be a sweet spot
to tie the knot.

12:21.141 --> 12:23.208
♪ ♪

12:25.078 --> 12:26.778
Those two trays
side by side.

12:26.780 --> 12:30.281
Chemical bath on the left,
water bath on the right.

12:30.283 --> 12:31.783
You sure know a lot about this.

12:31.785 --> 12:34.919
Yeah, well,
you pick up a few things.

12:34.921 --> 12:37.155
What are you doing?

12:37.157 --> 12:39.891
You know, just getting
the lay of the land.

12:43.830 --> 12:46.798
(Car drives by in the distance)

12:46.800 --> 12:49.200
(Rapid beeps, door unlatches)

12:53.106 --> 12:55.340
Fantastic.

12:55.342 --> 12:56.541
And now, what is your name?

12:56.543 --> 12:58.810
Luiz.

12:58.812 --> 13:00.445
Luiz, could you be a sweetheart?

13:00.447 --> 13:03.081
In my bag that you confiscated
is my lip balm.

13:03.083 --> 13:04.549
I find the air
in your country very dry.

13:04.551 --> 13:05.950
(Rapid beeps, door unlatches)
And, you know,

13:05.952 --> 13:07.452
I'm used to L.A.,
kind of, ocean breeze.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.788
I'll get it.

13:09.790 --> 13:12.023
(Door slides shut)

13:13.927 --> 13:15.827
Get those towels.

13:17.798 --> 13:19.931
Um, since you mentioned
Los Angeles,

13:19.933 --> 13:21.065
why can't you stay there?

13:21.067 --> 13:22.133
What are you running from?

13:22.135 --> 13:24.502
You remember
the old Tennessee flop?

13:24.504 --> 13:26.438
You worked that one
with me once.

13:26.439 --> 13:28.373
I don't remember
all the scams, mom, I was nine.

13:28.375 --> 13:31.810
Well, the Tennessee flop is
the reason I can't stay in L.A.

13:31.812 --> 13:33.912
Don't you ever tire of running?

13:33.914 --> 13:35.880
Does it ever occur to you
that disappearing

13:35.882 --> 13:37.048
will break Ralph's heart?

13:37.050 --> 13:38.983
Did he say that?

13:38.985 --> 13:40.485
He didn't have to.

13:40.486 --> 13:41.986
And you know what else
will break his heart?

13:41.988 --> 13:43.221
Is if he never sees me again.

13:43.223 --> 13:44.989
You're right. Okay.

13:44.991 --> 13:46.858
I could swear that,
when I was at that vent,

13:46.860 --> 13:48.860
I could hear a car
a few miles away.

13:48.862 --> 13:50.428
Okay, how does that help us?

13:50.429 --> 13:51.995
If we...
(Rapid beeps, door unlatches)

13:56.570 --> 13:58.002
Now get to work.

13:58.004 --> 13:59.904
<i> Gracias.</i>

14:01.942 --> 14:05.376
Now, we may be stuck upstairs
but Walter's just beneath us.

14:07.247 --> 14:09.013
There's a tree line
not that far out.

14:09.015 --> 14:10.548
I think I can figure out
a way out of here.

14:10.550 --> 14:14.219
We just need our new pal luiz
to make a delivery.

14:14.221 --> 14:16.988
Ready.
Sylvester:
Ready.

14:16.990 --> 14:18.256
(Softly):
Good. Okay.

14:18.258 --> 14:19.624
Check it out.

14:28.535 --> 14:31.236
Wow, our holographic strip
is indistinguishable

14:31.238 --> 14:33.572
from the authentic strip.

14:33.573 --> 14:35.907
What do we think these guys are
gonna buy with this fake money?

14:35.909 --> 14:37.275
Cabe:
Loose nuclear material.

14:37.277 --> 14:38.576
Chemical weapons.

14:38.578 --> 14:40.945
Anything that can bring
the U.S. to its knees.

14:40.947 --> 14:41.946
Fantastic.

14:41.948 --> 14:43.047
Our host is gonna expect

14:43.049 --> 14:44.582
this machine to be
up and running soon.

14:44.584 --> 14:45.784
Yeah, problem is,

14:45.785 --> 14:46.985
the sooner we're done
with the task,

14:46.987 --> 14:48.052
the sooner we're extraneous.

14:49.155 --> 14:52.023
(Rapid beeps, door unlatches)

14:52.025 --> 14:54.926
Luiz:
Varnish sample.

14:54.928 --> 14:57.128
The lady said to make sure
to test both sides.

14:58.098 --> 14:59.931
And Lucinda said that,
if that press

14:59.933 --> 15:02.300
is not running in five minutes

15:02.302 --> 15:04.569
that I should
paint the walls red.

15:08.942 --> 15:11.276
Sylvester:
I think that was a euphemism.

15:11.278 --> 15:13.978
Not about redecorating.

15:13.980 --> 15:16.214
Test both sides?

15:16.216 --> 15:18.116
The bills are made
of one material.

15:18.118 --> 15:20.218
Side is irrelevant.

15:20.220 --> 15:23.421
Maybe she didn't mean
both sides of the dollar.

15:23.423 --> 15:26.391
(Groans, then chuckles)

15:26.393 --> 15:32.030
Maybe she meant
both sides of the tub.

15:32.032 --> 15:35.033
"Tree line 50 feet
out on printer side.

15:35.035 --> 15:36.234
Cars 3 miles away."

15:36.236 --> 15:38.303
Cabe:
Well, that's all great and all,

15:38.305 --> 15:40.104
but how we gonna walk
through cinder blocks?

15:40.106 --> 15:41.539
Well, maybe we can
drill through it.

15:41.541 --> 15:44.208
We can use the spools
from the printing press.

15:44.210 --> 15:45.476
If we offset them a foot,

15:45.478 --> 15:46.978
we could use them
to drill through.

15:46.980 --> 15:48.346
Cabe:
And all our pals will hear

15:48.348 --> 15:50.682
is this metallic beast
churning out bills.

15:50.684 --> 15:52.717
Except they have a habit
of walking in unannounced.

15:52.719 --> 15:54.686
Well, I may have a solution
for that, too.

15:57.057 --> 15:59.090
But it would mean destroying
your super fun guy

15:59.092 --> 16:02.226
utility watch.

16:02.228 --> 16:03.661
(Toby scoffs)
You call that oaky?

16:03.663 --> 16:05.480
How many tastes
does that make?

16:05.481 --> 16:07.298
They have 16 varietals,
it's not my fault I'm thorough.

16:13.073 --> 16:14.505
Come to the barrel shed with me?

16:14.507 --> 16:16.441
Yes, ma'am.

16:16.443 --> 16:18.309
The booze must be affecting
my receptors.

16:18.311 --> 16:20.011
I had no idea
you were feeling frisky.

16:20.013 --> 16:21.613
Hey, shut up,
you idiot.

16:21.614 --> 16:23.214
There's a guy in a brown jacket
who's been tailing us

16:23.216 --> 16:24.449
for five minutes,
maybe even longer.

16:24.451 --> 16:25.450
Was he holding his arm

16:25.452 --> 16:27.118
close to his waist?
Yeah.

16:27.120 --> 16:28.653
I think he's packing a gun.
You're just telling me now?

16:28.655 --> 16:30.288
Well, you wouldn't shut up
about the sturdiness

16:30.290 --> 16:31.422
of the Pinot noir.

16:31.424 --> 16:33.541
Okay, well,
Walter's not punishing us.

16:33.542 --> 16:35.659
The guys must be in trouble and
we're goofing off drinking wine.

16:35.662 --> 16:37.996
What's this about "we"?
Man:
Don't move.

16:37.998 --> 16:39.597
You're coming with me.

16:39.599 --> 16:42.000
We're gonna be joining
the rest of your team.

16:42.002 --> 16:43.167
Duck!

16:44.304 --> 16:46.704
(Gunshots)

16:52.012 --> 16:54.078
Happy:
Truck, truck, truck!

16:54.080 --> 16:57.281
You drive! I'm pickled!

17:04.090 --> 17:05.690
(Whistles)

17:06.793 --> 17:08.192
Shut up.
(Engine starts)

17:16.803 --> 17:18.503
(Machine whirring)

17:21.608 --> 17:24.075
Tell your boss
it's up and running.

17:24.077 --> 17:25.443
Cabe: Shouldn't be more
than a couple of hours

17:25.445 --> 17:28.212
and those pallets
will be full.

17:30.650 --> 17:32.417
(Rapid beeps)

17:43.797 --> 17:48.433
Gotcha.

17:48.435 --> 17:49.734
Walter:
Okay, the red is the wire

17:49.736 --> 17:51.736
to the hard drive.
Sly, your watch?

17:51.738 --> 17:54.305
And you can expect
a hard drive like this

17:54.307 --> 17:55.673
to keep records for a month.

17:55.675 --> 17:58.643
12:35, 2:52, 5:01.

17:58.645 --> 18:01.846
So the reader registers an entry
every two hours.

18:01.848 --> 18:03.514
That's when the guards
make their rounds.

18:03.516 --> 18:04.682
That gives us
an hour and 59 minutes

18:04.684 --> 18:06.217
to get through the wall,

18:06.218 --> 18:07.751
get help, and come back
before they return.

18:07.754 --> 18:09.220
If we're late,
they kill Veronica and Paige.

18:09.222 --> 18:11.155
Then we better do this right.

18:11.724 --> 18:13.224
All right.

18:17.564 --> 18:19.230
All right, ready?
Yeah.

18:21.835 --> 18:24.335
Looks like it's working!

18:24.337 --> 18:25.770
(Faint drilling in the distance)

18:27.240 --> 18:28.739
They're drilling
through the wall.

18:28.741 --> 18:29.807
It's faint,

18:29.809 --> 18:31.442
but I'd know
that sound anywhere.

18:31.444 --> 18:32.643
Don't even want to ask why.

18:35.281 --> 18:37.281
Sylvester:
There's a chance all this dust

18:37.283 --> 18:38.616
might clog the press.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.218
If it shuts down,
it'll alert the guards

18:40.220 --> 18:41.419
that something's off.

18:41.421 --> 18:42.720
Walter:
We have to leave it on.

18:42.722 --> 18:44.889
If we stop it,
the guards will eventually come.

18:44.891 --> 18:47.325
Fellas, I think I see
some daylight.

19:15.255 --> 19:16.254
Oh!

19:21.528 --> 19:23.394
They made it!

19:23.396 --> 19:25.163
Walter:
We need to move fast.

19:25.165 --> 19:27.298
Only 81 minutes
until the guard checks in.

19:27.300 --> 19:29.167
(Dogs barking in the distance)

19:29.169 --> 19:31.302
Anyone else hear dogs?

19:31.304 --> 19:35.473
(Barking and snarling)

19:35.475 --> 19:38.809
Doesn't this dictator feed
people to his hungry dogs?

19:38.811 --> 19:40.511
They don't sound too far off.
Run like hell!

19:49.856 --> 19:51.522
Still behind us.

19:53.393 --> 19:54.492
Ah, and we have no weapon!

19:54.494 --> 19:56.327
I do have liquid courage.

19:56.329 --> 19:58.429
What are you doing?
No time to explain.

19:58.431 --> 20:01.199
Keep her steady.

20:02.335 --> 20:03.334
(Yelps)

20:09.909 --> 20:11.509
(Gun clicking)

20:16.449 --> 20:19.850
Happy, I saw a pack of smokes
and a lighter up there,

20:19.852 --> 20:21.452
I need a flame.

20:22.589 --> 20:24.322
(Grunts)

20:35.468 --> 20:36.567
(Tires screeching)

20:40.873 --> 20:42.440
Okay.

20:42.442 --> 20:43.874
That sobered me up.

20:45.345 --> 20:46.777
(Dogs barking)

20:46.779 --> 20:48.379
(Panting)

20:48.381 --> 20:50.381
Cabe:
Stop!

20:50.383 --> 20:51.716
We're never gonna outrun them.

20:51.718 --> 20:53.251
Let's get up in these trees!

20:53.253 --> 20:54.452
Sylvester:
How did we not know

20:54.454 --> 20:55.920
about cujo and co.?

20:55.921 --> 20:57.387
Well, the norteguayans
must let the dogs

20:57.390 --> 20:59.423
roam around the
perimeter freely.

20:59.425 --> 21:00.525
Veronica and Paige
never saw them.

21:00.526 --> 21:01.626
And the barking
isn't a problem?

21:01.628 --> 21:03.594
Noise from the printing press
will cover it.

21:03.596 --> 21:04.962
Besides,

21:04.964 --> 21:06.597
if they knew we'd have escaped,

21:06.599 --> 21:08.966
we would have heard gunshots
already.

21:08.968 --> 21:10.835
Well, we can't just stay
in a tree forever.

21:10.837 --> 21:13.838
What we need is something to
knock the dogs off of our scent.

21:14.807 --> 21:16.641
What about cayenne pepper?

21:16.643 --> 21:18.743
Should be more than enough.

21:18.745 --> 21:20.478
Rub it on the tree.
You know,

21:20.480 --> 21:21.746
it's this kind of ingenuity

21:21.747 --> 21:23.013
that makes you
such a valuable team member.

21:23.014 --> 21:24.280
Shut up and just
rub that all over

21:24.284 --> 21:25.449
and get up
that tree.
Yeah.

21:25.451 --> 21:26.484
Okay.
Let's go.

21:26.486 --> 21:28.486
The tree...

21:28.488 --> 21:29.820
Hurry up, I can see the dogs!

21:29.822 --> 21:30.821
Come on!

21:30.823 --> 21:32.657
(Barking)

21:34.761 --> 21:36.727
How did you learn
how to do all this?

21:36.729 --> 21:38.763
Remember when I worked
at a graphic design firm

21:38.765 --> 21:39.930
when you were 12?
Mm-hmm.

21:39.932 --> 21:42.466
Well, it was less
graphic design firm,

21:42.468 --> 21:44.468
and more fake
bond scheme.

21:44.470 --> 21:46.671
Unbelievable.

21:46.673 --> 21:48.873
Do you hear that?

21:48.875 --> 21:50.441
I don't hear
anything.

21:50.443 --> 21:51.626
Exactly.

21:51.627 --> 21:52.810
The printing press
stopped running.

21:53.946 --> 21:55.980
If it's off
for more than a few minutes,

21:55.982 --> 21:57.982
Lucinda and the guards will go
to see what's going on

21:57.984 --> 22:01.485
and see that the others escaped.

22:01.487 --> 22:02.787
They couldn't rig
that printing press

22:02.789 --> 22:04.555
to keep running
for longer than that?

22:04.557 --> 22:06.691
I mean, some
geniuses they are!

22:06.693 --> 22:07.892
Okay, I'm sure
whatever they did

22:07.894 --> 22:10.561
was the best option
available in the moment.

22:10.563 --> 22:12.663
Well, the moment we're in is
that your friends just ran off

22:12.665 --> 22:13.998
and left us here to die!

22:14.000 --> 22:17.501
Them escaping to the tree line
was your idea!

22:17.503 --> 22:18.719
I gave them an option!

22:18.720 --> 22:19.936
They decided
they could pull it off--

22:19.939 --> 22:21.605
which, clearly, they can't!

22:21.607 --> 22:22.673
I was just trying
to help!

22:22.675 --> 22:24.442
That's all I've ever done!

22:24.444 --> 22:26.110
All you've ever done?
Are you kidding me?

22:26.112 --> 22:28.045
Did you help
me and dad

22:28.047 --> 22:29.714
every time you disappeared
to run some con?

22:29.716 --> 22:31.415
Every time you got arrested
in front of me?

22:31.417 --> 22:33.951
Every time you left us
on our own?

22:33.953 --> 22:35.486
You have never

22:35.488 --> 22:36.921
helped me, ever!
You have only hurt me,

22:36.923 --> 22:38.489
over and over.

22:38.491 --> 22:40.825
I swear, I can't believe
i let you back into my life!

22:43.796 --> 22:45.129
Paige...
What?!

22:45.131 --> 22:47.098
Pai--

22:47.100 --> 22:48.899
mom?
Oh.

22:48.901 --> 22:50.434
Mom?
(Gasps)

22:50.436 --> 22:51.902
Mom?

22:51.904 --> 22:52.903
I can't breathe.

22:52.905 --> 22:53.971
Oh.

22:53.973 --> 22:56.640
Get down here!
We need some help!

22:56.642 --> 22:57.842
Oh, pai-- oh!

22:59.645 --> 23:01.379
(Gasps)
Oh, my god! Mom!

23:01.381 --> 23:02.747
(Door lock beeps)
Please!

23:03.916 --> 23:04.882
What's going on in here?

23:04.884 --> 23:07.118
It just happened!
Her heart.

23:09.455 --> 23:10.821
Please!

23:18.931 --> 23:20.464
Toby:
Yeah,

23:20.466 --> 23:21.766
he's alive, but
he's gonna be out for a while.

23:21.768 --> 23:23.067
I bet you these zip ties
were for us.

23:26.472 --> 23:28.739
Lucky they're
"one size fits all."

23:31.477 --> 23:32.810
What are you doin'?

23:32.812 --> 23:34.779
Looking for anything
that'll give us some insight

23:34.781 --> 23:36.881
into what this guy is up to.

23:36.883 --> 23:39.683
Like this key fob,
for instance.

23:39.685 --> 23:40.918
What it's for,

23:40.920 --> 23:42.720
I have no idea.
That might be our only chance

23:42.722 --> 23:44.155
to find the guys; We got
to hack it and fast!

23:44.157 --> 23:46.490
To the genius lair!

23:46.492 --> 23:48.058
It's better than saying,
"to the dirty garage."

23:48.060 --> 23:49.860
Just move it.

23:51.697 --> 23:53.431
Ow!

23:55.134 --> 23:56.133
Hurry up!

24:06.579 --> 24:08.846
She needs a doctor,
not aspirin!

24:12.084 --> 24:14.618
Lucinda:
She's going nowhere.

24:14.620 --> 24:15.786
If she's having
a cardiac episode,

24:15.788 --> 24:17.855
aspirin will thin her blood.

24:17.857 --> 24:19.156
(Weakly):
I have a bad heart.

24:19.158 --> 24:22.026
It's been that way
since I was little.

24:22.028 --> 24:24.061
Just don't die
before finishing the job.

24:24.063 --> 24:26.096
(Lucinda speaking Spanish)

24:26.098 --> 24:27.698
(Door lock beeps)
Martin should have
checked in by now.

24:27.700 --> 24:29.133
(Door opens)
Try him again.

24:35.174 --> 24:37.808
(Door closes)

24:40.546 --> 24:42.596
I can't believe you.

24:42.597 --> 24:44.647
You are out of your mind.
Standard Illinois waltz.

24:44.650 --> 24:47.985
You slipped into character
just like it was an old shoe.

24:47.987 --> 24:49.820
I wasn't in character,
i thought you were dying!

24:49.822 --> 24:51.088
And if you were trying
to buy us more time,

24:51.090 --> 24:52.823
that only got us
a few extra minutes, at most.

24:52.825 --> 24:54.725
I got us more
than time.

24:54.727 --> 24:58.262
Luiz's card key to all the rooms
in the compound.

25:00.066 --> 25:03.200
(Sniffing)

25:10.977 --> 25:12.843
(Whispers):
They're not leaving.

25:15.648 --> 25:19.049
Then we make it unpleasant
for them to stay.

25:19.051 --> 25:20.985
What are you doing?

25:20.987 --> 25:23.153
I'm making a dog whistle.

25:23.155 --> 25:25.055
Actually, we're making
the dog whistle.

25:25.057 --> 25:25.990
I know all of us

25:25.992 --> 25:27.525
have our own roles

25:27.527 --> 25:29.527
and I shouldn't minimize
each other's contributions.

25:29.529 --> 25:31.662
Just shut up and tell
us what we need to do.

25:31.664 --> 25:33.097
Okay, get some of the tree sap
from behind you

25:33.099 --> 25:34.231
and put it
on your fingers

25:34.233 --> 25:36.100
and then send it my way.

25:38.037 --> 25:39.870
Sylvester:
You're reducing the air opening

25:39.872 --> 25:42.072
to create a high frequency.

25:42.074 --> 25:44.108
Exactly. And if I can
distribute it evenly,

25:44.110 --> 25:45.643
then I should be able
to get a whistle

25:45.645 --> 25:47.177
at above 16,000 hertz.

25:47.179 --> 25:48.879
Okay, that
should do it.

25:51.284 --> 25:53.017
(High-pitched whistle blowing)

25:53.819 --> 25:56.186
(Dog whining)

25:56.188 --> 25:57.688
Keep going,
it's working.

25:57.690 --> 25:59.890
(Whining, barking)

26:02.261 --> 26:04.595
<i> Hasta luego,</i> fleabags!

26:04.597 --> 26:06.063
They won't
be a problem anymore.

26:06.065 --> 26:07.197
With all that cayenne,

26:07.199 --> 26:08.866
there's no way
to get our scent back now.

26:08.868 --> 26:09.934
Then let's move.

26:17.109 --> 26:19.009
Veronica:
I saw more guards

26:19.011 --> 26:21.078
on the way to the bathroom
at Perryville prison.

26:21.080 --> 26:22.313
Yeah, that's
a good thing.

26:22.315 --> 26:24.281
I know. Strange.

26:26.252 --> 26:28.052
Speaking of strange,

26:28.054 --> 26:30.020
you had no idea that my
argument with you was a con,

26:30.022 --> 26:31.472
and you said some
pretty hurtful things.

26:31.473 --> 26:32.923
Yeah, well, I meant every word.
And you could've told me

26:32.925 --> 26:34.758
you were gonna
fake a heart attack.

26:34.760 --> 26:38.062
What is the first rule
of the con artist?

26:38.064 --> 26:41.799
Believe the lie.
(Sighs)

26:41.801 --> 26:44.201
If Lucinda hadn't believed that
you were worried about me,

26:44.203 --> 26:45.836
she would have seen
through the whole thing,

26:45.838 --> 26:48.238
so I insulted
your friends,

26:48.240 --> 26:51.675
got you all riled up, and
then grabbed my chest.

26:51.677 --> 26:54.144
And you were worried
for me, weren't you?

26:54.146 --> 26:56.780
I'm not talking
about this right now.

26:56.782 --> 26:58.215
You were worried.

27:00.286 --> 27:02.119
(Whispers):
The door is just ahead.

27:02.121 --> 27:04.388
We slip in, turn
the printer on,

27:04.390 --> 27:07.057
nice and easy.

27:10.196 --> 27:12.229
(Door lock beeps)

27:14.367 --> 27:17.267
You made a very quick recovery.

27:17.269 --> 27:18.869
Oh, no, my
chest hurts.

27:18.871 --> 27:20.204
Not gonna work, mom.

27:20.206 --> 27:22.106
Okay.

27:23.109 --> 27:24.975
Walter:
Wait a minute.

27:27.246 --> 27:29.279
Huh?

27:29.281 --> 27:31.281
What the hell?

27:33.185 --> 27:34.151
Where are we?

27:34.153 --> 27:35.319
You're in my
way, jackasses!

27:35.321 --> 27:36.353
(Gasps)

27:40.126 --> 27:42.126
Usa!

27:43.829 --> 27:45.963
So the good news is:
We never left home.

27:45.965 --> 27:48.165
The bad news is:

27:48.167 --> 27:50.868
We have no idea
what's really going on.

27:56.942 --> 27:57.941
When we were
unconscious,

27:57.943 --> 27:59.877
they even reprogrammed
my watch

27:59.879 --> 28:02.046
to make us think that
we flew for four hours,

28:02.048 --> 28:04.181
when they only drove us for one.
Why would they do all that?

28:04.183 --> 28:06.717
Psych ops.
A team that believes

28:06.719 --> 28:08.118
it's being held
in a foreign dictatorship

28:08.120 --> 28:10.387
complies with captors' demands
faster

28:10.389 --> 28:12.322
than one that thinks
it's on home turf

28:12.324 --> 28:13.857
where it can be rescued.

28:13.859 --> 28:15.075
But the norteguayans
wouldn't be here

28:15.076 --> 28:16.292
unless they were planning
something much bigger

28:16.295 --> 28:18.862
than simple black market
arms purchases.

28:18.864 --> 28:20.964
You got any idea
what that could be?

28:20.966 --> 28:22.866
No. But right now,

28:22.868 --> 28:24.835
Paige and Veronica
are our first priority.

28:24.837 --> 28:27.237
Homeland agent
cabe gallo,

28:27.239 --> 28:28.839
got an emergency,

28:28.841 --> 28:30.741
need a secure landline.
Hold on, chief,

28:30.743 --> 28:31.942
you can't come in here

28:31.944 --> 28:32.943
and just start
runnin' through my joint,

28:32.945 --> 28:33.811
especially when

28:33.813 --> 28:35.012
I don't see
no badge.

28:35.014 --> 28:37.481
You corps?
Yeah.

28:37.483 --> 28:40.918
So you probably went into
Pendleton, what, early '70s?

28:40.920 --> 28:42.953
May have had
drill instructor Todd?

28:42.955 --> 28:45.055
Di barrios.

28:45.057 --> 28:46.674
Yeah, he was no picnic, either.

28:46.675 --> 28:48.292
I ate the same slop
off a shingle you did,

28:48.294 --> 28:50.160
mopped the same
barracks.

28:50.162 --> 28:53.063
From one devil dog to another,
i need your phone.

28:54.867 --> 28:56.233
There's an office in the back.

28:58.971 --> 29:01.438
Hi. I was not
in the marine corps,

29:01.440 --> 29:03.841
but I was in student council.

29:03.843 --> 29:06.009
So, do you have a cell phone
i could borrow?

29:08.848 --> 29:10.948
Happy:
This is pointless.

29:10.950 --> 29:14.017
This is the only shot we have
at finding the guys.

29:14.019 --> 29:15.786
I just have to
get past the encryption.

29:15.788 --> 29:18.288
(Phone ringing)

29:18.290 --> 29:19.890
Simi valley?

29:20.993 --> 29:22.459
Who is this?
Walter: Where are you guys?

29:22.461 --> 29:24.495
We've been trying
to call your cell phones.

29:24.497 --> 29:25.630
Our cell phones are
at crooning crane's

29:25.631 --> 29:26.764
no phone zone.
Where are you guys?

29:26.766 --> 29:28.266
Well, we thought

29:28.267 --> 29:29.767
we were kidnapped to
a secret government compound

29:29.769 --> 29:32.269
in norteguay, but it turns out
it was just simi valley.

29:32.271 --> 29:33.904
Yeah, well, that makes sense.

29:33.906 --> 29:34.938
We got out,
except Veronica and Paige,

29:34.940 --> 29:36.006
who are still back there.

29:36.008 --> 29:38.041
Cabe's calling homeland
for backup.

29:38.043 --> 29:39.209
Well, whoever came after
you guys

29:39.211 --> 29:40.878
sent someone after us, too.

29:40.880 --> 29:43.013
We got a key fob off the guy

29:43.015 --> 29:44.848
and we're using sly's scanner
to crack it,

29:44.850 --> 29:45.949
but it's encrypted.

29:45.951 --> 29:47.434
Okay, uh, keep at it.

29:47.435 --> 29:48.918
Pursue whatever Avenue
you think is best.

29:48.921 --> 29:51.288
I trust your judgment
implicitly.

29:51.290 --> 29:52.990
You're getting real weird, Walt.

29:52.992 --> 29:54.024
(Door opens)

29:54.026 --> 29:55.926
(Sighs)

29:55.928 --> 29:57.127
What's wrong?

29:57.129 --> 30:00.230
Homeland said
to take a beat.

30:00.232 --> 30:01.899
What? Why?

30:01.901 --> 30:03.267
Turns out Lucinda durante
isn't just

30:03.269 --> 30:05.002
the sister of dictator durante.

30:05.004 --> 30:06.303
As of four months ago,

30:06.305 --> 30:09.072
she's also norteguay's
ambassador to the U.S.

30:09.074 --> 30:11.408
Giving her diplomatic immunity.

30:11.410 --> 30:13.210
Tensions are high
between our nations.

30:13.212 --> 30:15.979
Any incident could set off
a very dangerous chain reaction.

30:15.981 --> 30:17.147
We can't just cuff her

30:17.149 --> 30:18.582
and take her
to county.

30:18.584 --> 30:20.250
Homeland's on the case,

30:20.252 --> 30:22.085
and they're making sure
to cross every "t"

30:22.087 --> 30:23.153
and dot every "i."

30:23.154 --> 30:24.220
And that's gonna take a while.

30:24.223 --> 30:25.889
We don't have a while.
We need to go now.

30:26.892 --> 30:28.892
Cabe:
Hey, buddy.

30:28.894 --> 30:30.260
Any chance you could help?

30:30.262 --> 30:32.129
Gray pickup, outside.

30:34.266 --> 30:36.300
Oh, I'm gonna need
to borrow your cell.

30:39.038 --> 30:41.071
Don't take this the wrong way,

30:41.073 --> 30:43.874
but a saloon like this
has got to have protection.

30:50.850 --> 30:52.983
Semper fi.

30:54.486 --> 30:56.086

30:56.088 --> 30:57.521
Lucinda:
Come on, faster!

30:57.523 --> 30:58.922
Nothing left behind!

30:58.924 --> 31:00.057
Luiz: Where are
your friends?

31:00.059 --> 31:00.991
I don't know.

31:00.993 --> 31:02.192
(Gun hammer clicks)

31:02.194 --> 31:03.594
Where did they go?

31:03.596 --> 31:05.262
(Truck approaching)

31:10.269 --> 31:12.336
Lucinda:
Go, go, go, go, go!

31:22.281 --> 31:23.947
Stay down! Stay down!

31:32.191 --> 31:34.024
They shot the tires.

31:34.026 --> 31:35.993
I'll go see
if I can find some wheels!

31:37.096 --> 31:38.028
You okay?

31:38.030 --> 31:39.596
Yeah. We're all right.

31:39.598 --> 31:41.115
I'm glad you guys made it.

31:41.116 --> 31:42.633
Walter: Well, not quick enough.
If we don't stop Lucinda,

31:42.635 --> 31:44.001
she's gonna get
out of the country

31:44.003 --> 31:45.669
with $500 million in supernotes.

31:45.671 --> 31:47.037
Why would she flee
her own country?

31:47.039 --> 31:48.305
Sylvester:
Yeah. About that.

31:48.307 --> 31:49.306
We're in simi valley.

31:49.308 --> 31:50.540
(Gasps)

31:50.542 --> 31:52.075
That woman is a genius.

31:52.077 --> 31:54.912
She pulled off
the punxsutawney peek-a-boo.

31:54.914 --> 31:56.113
You're impressed.

31:56.115 --> 31:58.181
Did tchaikovsky
get mad at brahms?

31:58.183 --> 31:59.249
Yes, actually.

32:00.486 --> 32:02.052
Guys, we have
Veronica and Paige.

32:02.054 --> 32:03.987
What about you?
We cracked the key fob.

32:03.989 --> 32:05.956
They're not leaving the country.

32:05.957 --> 32:07.924
The fake compound
was here for a reason.

32:07.927 --> 32:11.028
The fob opens a door
at 9891 madera road.

32:11.030 --> 32:13.030
That must be
where Lucinda is heading.

32:13.032 --> 32:15.198
Yeah, well. We don't have
any way to get there.

32:15.200 --> 32:17.968
Yes, we do.

32:17.970 --> 32:19.236
In style.

32:19.238 --> 32:20.237
(Tires screech)

32:20.239 --> 32:21.338
Get in.

32:22.341 --> 32:25.075
Okay. But this time,

32:25.077 --> 32:26.610
we have to go with the windows

32:26.612 --> 32:28.178
rolled down the entire way.

32:28.180 --> 32:31.214
Windows down?
Cabe's been eating
that jerky again.

32:31.216 --> 32:33.016
Oh.

32:33.018 --> 32:36.019
Veronica's bag, sly's phone.

32:36.021 --> 32:37.220
They must've left it
here before.

32:37.222 --> 32:38.488
Here.

32:38.490 --> 32:40.157
Sylvester:
So,

32:40.159 --> 32:42.993
based on all the gun-pointing
and rope-tying,

32:42.995 --> 32:45.062
I assume they figured out
that we'd gone, hmm?

32:45.064 --> 32:47.731
Got hairy but we stayed cool.

32:47.733 --> 32:49.566
That's right.

32:49.568 --> 32:51.435
You're welcome, by the way.

32:51.437 --> 32:52.669
Excuse me?

32:52.671 --> 32:54.271
Oh, well, today
we got kidnapped,

32:54.273 --> 32:55.605
locked in a room

32:55.607 --> 32:58.008
with toxic chemicals, shot at.

32:58.010 --> 32:59.643
But you handled
yourself like a champ.

33:01.513 --> 33:03.480
I mean, yes. I threw
you in the deep end

33:03.482 --> 33:04.648
when you were a child,

33:04.650 --> 33:07.684
but you learned how
to swim on your own.

33:07.686 --> 33:10.053
You're turning abandonment
into a recipe

33:10.055 --> 33:12.155
for successful parenting.

33:12.157 --> 33:14.658
You can't argue with success.

33:14.660 --> 33:17.094
(Chuckles softly)

33:19.431 --> 33:20.530
We're here!

33:21.500 --> 33:25.002
This is just
a regular warehouse.

33:25.004 --> 33:28.071
Which means there's something
very irregular inside.

33:28.073 --> 33:30.207
If the norteguayans were
here, they're long gone now.

33:30.209 --> 33:32.275
They were definitely here.

33:32.277 --> 33:33.710
The biometric reader

33:33.712 --> 33:34.711
has been disabled.

33:34.713 --> 33:36.279
And... a little bit ajar.

33:36.281 --> 33:37.647
(Grunts)

33:37.649 --> 33:39.082
Cabe.

33:43.255 --> 33:45.622
They disabled
those cameras, too.

33:49.228 --> 33:52.129
Toby, happy,
are you seeing this?

33:52.131 --> 33:54.531
Happy: Yeah.
Best guess is the warehouse

33:54.533 --> 33:56.133
is largely automated,

33:56.135 --> 33:58.168
and Lucinda paid off
any minimal human security

33:58.170 --> 33:59.403
to not be there today.

34:01.240 --> 34:03.073
Toby, is there any chance
you can transmit

34:03.075 --> 34:05.242
the key fob's code to my phone?

34:05.244 --> 34:06.576
Uh, sending now.

34:06.578 --> 34:08.311
(Beeping)

34:08.313 --> 34:10.247
Great.

34:16.221 --> 34:17.621
Holy stack of greenbacks.

34:17.623 --> 34:18.755
Veronica:
This must be

34:18.757 --> 34:20.490
a federal way station.

34:20.492 --> 34:22.292
Paige:
What's a way station?

34:22.294 --> 34:24.628
Cabe: Hidden treasury locations
across the country

34:24.630 --> 34:26.263
where they store cash

34:26.265 --> 34:27.564
before distributing it to banks.

34:27.566 --> 34:29.299
Happy:
Why would the norteguayans need

34:29.301 --> 34:30.734
to print all those fake bills

34:30.736 --> 34:32.102
if they could
just rob this place?

34:32.104 --> 34:33.103
'Cause they didn't want

34:33.105 --> 34:34.237
to steal the money.

34:34.239 --> 34:35.639
They wanted to leave the money.

34:35.641 --> 34:37.741
The counterfeit cash
is hidden here

34:37.743 --> 34:39.476
amongst the real currency.

34:39.478 --> 34:41.678
Lucinda said the U.S.
brought norteguay to its knees

34:41.680 --> 34:43.313
via sanctions.

34:43.315 --> 34:45.182
Now they want
to hurt our economy.

34:45.184 --> 34:46.650
Happy:
By mixing a huge amount

34:46.652 --> 34:49.319
of fake cash in with the real,
the dollar will devalue.

34:49.321 --> 34:52.089
Once the public finds out about
indistinguishable counterfeits,

34:52.091 --> 34:53.523
bank runs will begin

34:53.525 --> 34:56.193
as people start to fear
that their cash is worthless.

34:56.195 --> 34:57.427
It'll spread globally,

34:57.429 --> 34:58.762
it'll crash the world economy.

34:58.764 --> 35:00.197
Toby: Most devastating way
to poison someone

35:00.199 --> 35:02.566
is to inject them
right in the heart.

35:02.568 --> 35:05.569
That way station is the heart
of cash disbursement.

35:05.571 --> 35:08.438
Homeland can quarantine the
warehouse, destroy the bills,

35:08.440 --> 35:10.240
reprint the original allotment.

35:10.242 --> 35:12.442
None of the bogus bills
hit circulation.

35:12.444 --> 35:13.510
Good work, team.

35:13.512 --> 35:15.679
Yeah. Or as I would say,
good teamwork.

They must've lain in wait
to see if we followed her.

35:27.626 --> 35:29.292
And now they're flooding
the ventilation system

No. Not from down here.

36:10.936 --> 36:12.653
Toby: Walt,
this increased concentration

36:12.654 --> 36:14.371

We can burn off the gas.

36:33.325 --> 36:34.691

36:34.693 --> 36:36.393
In the limo, you said
a single spark

36:36.395 --> 36:38.261
could cause an explosion.

36:38.263 --> 36:39.829
Yeah. That's what we want.

36:47.706 --> 36:49.673
us included, will go kablooey.

36:49.675 --> 36:51.808
Okay. I will set
an explosion on a timer

36:51.810 --> 36:55.312
using the smoke alarm. Potassium
chlorate on match tips

36:55.314 --> 36:57.581
will ignite after a few seconds
of connection to the batteries,

38:59.705 --> 39:01.871
Happy, um...

39:01.873 --> 39:03.506
Ugh.

39:03.508 --> 39:04.941
(Exhales)

39:04.943 --> 39:07.977
I can't afford my half
of crooning crane.

39:07.979 --> 39:10.013
I, um...

39:10.015 --> 39:11.781
I stopped gambling,
but that doesn't mean

39:11.783 --> 39:14.117
I stopped owing money
to a few people. It's, um...

39:14.119 --> 39:15.952
I-it's like student debt,

39:15.954 --> 39:18.555
except I make payments
to the university of Bruno.

39:20.859 --> 39:24.094
I have been holding off
on telling you, and I'm sorry.

39:34.639 --> 39:36.940
Know what this is?

39:36.942 --> 39:38.541
It's junk.

39:38.543 --> 39:41.678
Five figures worth
of rare motorcycle parts.

39:41.680 --> 39:43.580
I have a problem.

39:47.686 --> 39:49.452
We're both broke?

39:49.454 --> 39:51.388
Mm.

39:51.390 --> 39:53.556
That's great.
'Cause the truth is,

39:53.558 --> 39:55.592
I would marry you in
kovelsky's parking lot.

39:55.594 --> 39:57.560
I don't care as long
as we say our I do's.

39:57.562 --> 39:59.462
I don't care either.

39:59.464 --> 40:01.598
But let's not get married
in a parking lot.

40:01.600 --> 40:03.166
All right.

40:03.168 --> 40:04.801
I could pawn a
couple carburetors.

40:04.803 --> 40:05.835
No.

40:10.575 --> 40:12.642
Oh, look.
Grandma's back.

40:12.644 --> 40:13.643
Grandma!

40:13.645 --> 40:15.812
Oh, ralphy, honey, honey!

40:15.814 --> 40:17.046
I missed you so much.

40:17.048 --> 40:18.548
Ralph:
Want to see my new

40:18.550 --> 40:20.750
xenobiology book
i just got from the library?

40:20.752 --> 40:22.919
Yeah! Why don't you go
wash up for dinner

40:22.921 --> 40:25.722
and I'll be right there.

40:25.724 --> 40:30.460
You took him to the library
after all that happened today?

40:30.462 --> 40:31.761
He doesn't need
the burden of knowing

40:31.763 --> 40:33.596
everything that goes wrong here.

40:33.598 --> 40:36.800
You made me strong enough
for the both of us, remember?

40:36.802 --> 40:38.001
I know you're being sarcastic,

40:38.003 --> 40:41.204
but... I threw you in the water

40:41.206 --> 40:44.541
out past the breakers,
and you swam in safe.

40:45.544 --> 40:47.076
(Inhales)
Sylvester:
Sorry to interrupt.

40:47.078 --> 40:49.078
Paige, you are needed.

40:52.551 --> 40:54.918
Walter:
The secret service was formed

40:54.920 --> 40:56.753
in 1865 with the express purpose

40:56.755 --> 40:58.888
of suppressing
counterfeit currency.

40:58.890 --> 41:00.824
152 years later,
and you guys still

41:00.826 --> 41:02.826
haven't got the hang
of it. It was done

41:02.828 --> 41:04.527
in your own backyard.

41:04.529 --> 41:05.528
You had no idea.

41:05.530 --> 41:06.162
He's turned
his debriefing session

41:06.164 --> 41:07.931
into a dress-down lecture.

41:07.933 --> 41:09.950
The rubber band has snapped
and it's hit

41:09.951 --> 41:11.968
those agents in the face.
You got to mediate this mess.

41:11.970 --> 41:13.787
No.

41:13.788 --> 41:15.605
Let him figure it out.
I'm trying a new approach.

41:15.607 --> 41:17.106
I've been working with Walter
for two and a half years.

41:17.108 --> 41:18.241
I'm done being his water wings.

41:18.243 --> 41:19.776
We've built a
foundation together

41:19.778 --> 41:21.778
and the best way to help him
is to...

41:21.780 --> 41:23.112
Throw him into the deep end.

41:23.114 --> 41:25.048
I get it in theory,

41:25.049 --> 41:26.983
but the reality
is this goes one of two ways:

41:26.985 --> 41:29.018
Walter learns to swim
or he drowns.

41:29.020 --> 41:31.488
Happy:
We're on the news!

41:31.490 --> 41:33.056
News reporter:
An explosion at a warehouse

41:33.058 --> 41:34.190
in simi valley today
injured four people.

41:34.192 --> 41:36.125
Several passersby

41:36.127 --> 41:37.260
were also treated
for smoke inhalation.

41:37.262 --> 41:39.128
Authorities have...

41:39.130 --> 41:40.129
Uh-oh.

41:40.131 --> 41:41.631
What's wrong?

41:41.633 --> 41:44.801
I just look terrible.

41:44.803 --> 41:48.071
You have the same look Toby has
every time he runs into someone

41:48.073 --> 41:49.806
he owes money to.

41:49.808 --> 41:52.175
Someone you're avoiding
knows you're back in L.A.?

41:53.144 --> 41:55.011
They didn't.

41:55.013 --> 41:56.796
But they will now.

41:56.797 --> 41:58.580
News reporter:
...Scraps of money
fluttering to the ground...

41:58.583 --> 42:00.650
Paige, I'm gonna need
your help on this one.

42:01.720 --> 42:03.786
Do you remember
the Kentucky two step?
