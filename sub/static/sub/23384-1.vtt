01:13.542 --> 01:18.458
<i>Captain Sakaki, please respond.
We should be able to communicate.</i>

01:19.375 --> 01:22.083
My demands are to leave
Planet Tau-e immediately,

01:22.583 --> 01:24.542
and abandon the emigration project.

01:24.625 --> 01:27.792
Until I hear from the captain,
I'm not moving from here.

01:28.083 --> 01:31.958
<i>The Tau-e emigration decision was made
by the Central Committee.</i>

01:32.042 --> 01:36.125
<i>Your interference will be classified
as a first-degree crime.</i>

01:36.583 --> 01:38.875
People will not survive on that planet!

01:38.958 --> 01:42.792
If I'm a criminal,
then the Committee members are murderers!

01:42.875 --> 01:43.833
<i>Look at this.</i>

01:44.583 --> 01:47.542
<i>The emigration list is made up
of volunteers.</i>

01:47.792 --> 01:49.042
<i>Why do you interfere?</i>

01:49.125 --> 01:49.958
Shut up!

01:51.208 --> 01:54.917
<i>You gathered old men and women,
coerced them, and call that volunteering?</i>

01:55.000 --> 01:56.958
<i>You're going to kill them!</i>

01:57.250 --> 02:00.208
<i>All you want to do
is reduce the mouths to feed!</i>

02:00.292 --> 02:01.875
<i>Watch your words, Captain!</i>

02:02.708 --> 02:05.375
We're communicating
through an open channel.

02:05.458 --> 02:08.083
Everyone on this ship can hear us, right?

02:08.542 --> 02:12.792
<i>Right now, this ship is trying
to abandon the elderly people.</i>

02:13.250 --> 02:14.792
<i>We may be low on resources.</i>

02:15.292 --> 02:17.125
<i>But can this be forgiven?</i>

02:18.042 --> 02:21.625
<i>Weren't we looking for the promised land
that would save us?</i>

02:21.833 --> 02:26.125
<i>Can you really abandon the weak
and continue to hold your head up high?</i>

02:26.208 --> 02:27.125
Captain Sakaki.

02:28.667 --> 02:30.042
<i>I'll wait one hour.</i>

02:30.125 --> 02:34.875
<i>If this ship doesn't change course,
I will blow up this shuttle.</i>

02:35.667 --> 02:36.917
<i>I'm not bluffing!</i>

02:43.458 --> 02:46.292
<i>Please stop already, Captain Sakaki.</i>

02:47.417 --> 02:51.375
<i>It's true that we, the volunteers,
really do want to go to Tau-e.</i>

02:52.208 --> 02:54.958
<i>We're not being chased out or anything.</i>

02:55.250 --> 02:57.458
Don't be foolish! This is suicide!

02:58.250 --> 03:02.625
<i>We've been on this ship for over 20 years
while wandering through space.</i>

03:03.208 --> 03:05.708
<i>The young people may be able
to endure this.</i>

03:06.500 --> 03:09.542
<i>But for us, we're at our limit.</i>

03:09.958 --> 03:14.292
But... if you give up, then...

03:14.625 --> 03:15.542
<i>Haruo.</i>

03:15.833 --> 03:18.250
- ...then it's all over!
- <i>Haruo!</i>

03:19.417 --> 03:20.542
<i>It's okay.</i>

03:22.167 --> 03:25.208
<i>At least, when I die,
I'd like to be standing on land.</i>

03:26.208 --> 03:29.583
<i>It could be on any planet.</i>

03:31.500 --> 03:32.417
Grandpa.

05:01.792 --> 05:07.125
PLANET OF THE MONSTERS

05:13.208 --> 05:16.500
<i>It began in the last summer
of the 20th Century.</i>

05:17.750 --> 05:21.375
<i>Look at that! It's a monster!
This is an unbelievable scene.</i>

05:22.250 --> 05:23.708
<i>For the first time...</i>

05:24.292 --> 05:28.917
<i>humanity realized they weren't the rulers
of this planet anymore.</i>

05:31.708 --> 05:32.542
<i>Monsters.</i>

05:34.083 --> 05:40.000
<i>From the depths of the earth and sea,
or even from a forgotten divine myth,</i>

05:40.625 --> 05:42.708
<i>they kept appearing, relentlessly.</i>

05:44.083 --> 05:47.125
<i>In order to bring an end
to humanity's prosperity.</i>

05:47.375 --> 05:50.125
<i>The UN Countermeasure HQ
has named it "Godzilla."</i>

05:51.000 --> 05:54.208
<i>And then, in the end,
our worst nightmare appeared.</i>

05:55.292 --> 05:56.208
<i>Godzilla.</i>

05:57.792 --> 06:00.958
<i>Human or monster,
it burned everything in sight.</i>

06:01.958 --> 06:03.542
<i>The avatar of destruction.</i>

06:03.625 --> 06:08.792
<i>At 2:30 EST, a large-scale nuclear attack
was launched against Godzilla, but failed.</i>

06:08.875 --> 06:14.708
<i>At midnight, the EC Allied Forces
announced they have begun evacuations...</i>

06:14.792 --> 06:17.500
<i>The earth collapsed
and the skies rained fire.</i>

06:18.917 --> 06:24.417
<i>And then, it was not only Earth's humans
who feared its destructive power.</i>

06:25.000 --> 06:27.750
<i>Above the UN building,
mysterious flying objects...</i>

06:27.875 --> 06:31.250
<i>People of Earth, we are the Exif.</i>

06:32.083 --> 06:34.125
<i>We are observers and predictors.</i>

06:34.625 --> 06:37.042
<i>We have come to tell you of your destiny.</i>

06:37.542 --> 06:41.792
<i>The time of destruction is nigh.
You must discover a path to devotion.</i>

06:43.542 --> 06:44.875
<i>We are the Bilusaludo.</i>

06:45.542 --> 06:49.167
<i>Our home planet, the third planet
in the Bilusaludia Binary System,</i>

06:49.250 --> 06:52.500
<i>was swallowed by an accursed black hole
and destroyed.</i>

06:52.792 --> 06:56.458
<i>We are requesting immigration
to this solar system's third planet.</i>

06:56.542 --> 07:03.500
<i>If you accept, we promise to eradicate
your greatest threat, Godzilla.</i>

07:04.333 --> 07:08.417
<i>Those from a far away galaxy, who were
after this blue planet for themselves,</i>

07:08.500 --> 07:12.625
<i>didn't wait for this paradise of oxygen
and water to become scorched earth.</i>

07:13.500 --> 07:16.875
- <i>Godzilla has passed the defense line!</i>
- <i>The walls will give us some time.</i>

07:16.958 --> 07:19.792
<i>A3 and A5 blocks' AIs are silent!</i>

07:19.875 --> 07:23.083
- <i>Mecha-Godzilla won't activate!</i>
- <i>Why won't it activate?</i>

07:23.167 --> 07:25.542
<i>Atomic breath detected! Incoming!</i>

07:26.542 --> 07:29.125
<i>The fourth armored wall is gone!
It's over!</i>

07:29.208 --> 07:30.750
<i>We have no choice. Evacuate!</i>

07:30.833 --> 07:32.417
<i>All units, evacuate! Hurry!</i>

07:32.500 --> 07:36.167
<i>Wait! If we can activate Mecha-Godzilla,
we can defeat it!</i>

07:36.250 --> 07:37.667
<i>We're leaving, Galu-gu!</i>

07:37.875 --> 07:41.250
<i>However, even with the humanoids'
gathered intelligence,</i>

07:41.750 --> 07:45.167
<i>the destroyer's powers
overwhelmed us completely.</i>

07:59.667 --> 08:00.875
Where's Mom and Dad?

08:01.542 --> 08:04.208
They'll catch up soon.
See? That's the bus.

08:05.333 --> 08:06.708
Hey, what's that?

08:09.208 --> 08:10.125
It's Godzilla!

08:10.833 --> 08:11.792
Godzilla's here!

08:27.375 --> 08:28.417
Haruo! Hurry up!

08:57.792 --> 09:00.917
<i>I remember the flames that burned the sky,</i>

09:01.833 --> 09:04.375
<i>and the sunken, despaired faces
of the adults.</i>

09:08.250 --> 09:13.083
<i>We departed hoping to find
another inhabitable planet.</i>

09:14.917 --> 09:19.875
<i>However, we would soon pay the price
for such foolish optimism.</i>

09:24.750 --> 09:26.708
<i>In the frozen, black space,</i>

09:27.625 --> 09:31.500
<i>this was a kind of hell
worse than our planet destroyed in flames.</i>

09:37.292 --> 09:41.292
<i>There were endless days of suffering
from hunger, thirst, and cold.</i>

09:43.792 --> 09:45.250
<i>Some fell to disease.</i>

09:46.292 --> 09:48.875
<i>And others gradually lost their sanity.</i>

09:51.375 --> 09:54.750
<i>Our brethren's numbers plummeted
in the blink of an eye.</i>

09:58.417 --> 10:03.375
<i>Even those still living had no time
to mourn the dead.</i>

10:05.292 --> 10:09.125
<i>Kindness and pride are now
long-gone stories of the past.</i>

10:14.417 --> 10:20.708
<i>A fairy tale from the time we each had
unlimited access to water and oxygen.</i>

10:23.042 --> 10:26.083
<i>Where are we going... and for what reason?</i>

10:28.042 --> 10:32.208
<i>Must we endure the misery
of having prolonged our lives</i>

10:32.917 --> 10:34.708
<i>by sacrificing others?</i>

10:37.500 --> 10:39.083
<i>Why are we alive?</i>

10:39.833 --> 10:40.667
<i>Why?</i>

10:41.750 --> 10:42.667
<i>Why?</i>

10:58.458 --> 10:59.958
Were you having a nightmare?

11:01.042 --> 11:03.125
So, you're here, Metphies.

11:04.458 --> 11:08.333
It's also my job to listen
to a prisoner's confession.

11:08.792 --> 11:10.750
So I should repent to your god?

11:12.083 --> 11:14.208
I'd settle for a fake confession, too.

11:18.167 --> 11:19.875
Here's the data you asked for.

11:20.542 --> 11:21.375
Thank you.

11:23.250 --> 11:25.167
You have quite the persistence.

11:25.542 --> 11:27.708
I don't have anything else to do.

11:27.875 --> 11:31.125
Won't you get in trouble
if they find out you're helping?

11:31.833 --> 11:34.125
I have an interest in your enthusiasm.

11:34.958 --> 11:38.208
Why are you so curious
about digging up forbidden data

11:38.292 --> 11:41.500
that anyone would otherwise
wish to forget exists?

11:42.333 --> 11:43.958
"Why," you ask?

11:45.917 --> 11:47.708
I've also been thinking "why."

11:48.167 --> 11:53.417
Ever since I was thrown in here,
that word won't get out of my head.

11:54.583 --> 11:56.667
Why have we become so miserable?

11:57.458 --> 12:00.833
Was it inevitable? A justified punishment?

12:02.042 --> 12:02.958
No.

12:03.458 --> 12:07.667
The reason we're suffering
is because we lost to that bastard.

12:08.167 --> 12:11.042
We didn't fight to the end,
but gave up and ran away.

12:12.875 --> 12:14.208
Everything is destiny.

12:15.417 --> 12:20.083
We humanoids had no way
of fighting that monster.

12:21.708 --> 12:22.750
I disagree.

12:23.250 --> 12:24.833
And I'll show them.

12:30.792 --> 12:33.375
We just needed the right strategy
and planning,

12:33.458 --> 12:35.542
and humanity could have defeated it.

12:36.875 --> 12:38.125
I'll prove it.

12:39.625 --> 12:41.208
It's a strange thing.

12:42.542 --> 12:48.333
Unlike the young ones, your generation
experienced the calamity firsthand.

12:51.083 --> 12:55.875
And yet, it's as if
you want to see that creature again.

13:02.542 --> 13:06.125
Based on the Gematron calculation,
the predictions look disappointing.

13:06.833 --> 13:12.792
The possibility of finding
a habitable planet in 20 years is 0.1%.

13:13.167 --> 13:17.125
If we want better results than Tau-e,
the outlook is even grimmer.

13:17.458 --> 13:19.500
The lack of resources is severe.

13:20.375 --> 13:25.083
Even doubling the discomfort index,
life will be unsustainable in eight years.

13:25.750 --> 13:30.292
The landing ship explosion the other day
was a significant psychological blow.

13:30.375 --> 13:32.292
- This is getting...
- Indeed.

13:32.625 --> 13:36.042
We need to examine scenario number three
in a realistic way.

13:36.750 --> 13:41.500
Returning to Earth.
It's already 11.9 light years away.

13:42.167 --> 13:45.417
There's no precedent for traveling so far.
It's too risky.

13:46.000 --> 13:49.333
Gematron's guidance isn't bound
by time or distance.

13:49.458 --> 13:53.583
As long as the nuclear reactor
has sufficient energy, travel is possible.

13:53.667 --> 13:58.167
According to the ship's simulator,
it requires 170% of its operation ratio.

13:58.375 --> 14:00.958
I don't know if we can mobilize
the manpower.

14:01.167 --> 14:05.083
Would it be a constructive decision
to abandon the emigration?

14:05.167 --> 14:06.458
That's the problem.

14:07.083 --> 14:10.042
If we return to Earth,
would we be able to survive?

14:11.750 --> 14:15.958
It is currently impossible to calculate
how much time has passed on Earth.

14:16.042 --> 14:18.292
At the very least, a few thousand years.

14:18.708 --> 14:23.083
Since we fled Earth,
the environment should have calmed down.

14:23.167 --> 14:25.667
It's possible it could've gotten worse.

14:28.625 --> 14:32.625
The problem is that strange thesis
published on the shared server.

14:33.292 --> 14:36.875
Why would that research thesis appear
at a time like this?

14:37.583 --> 14:39.417
The writer remains anonymous,

14:39.500 --> 14:44.458
but it contains information that requires
special log-in credentials to access.

14:45.000 --> 14:49.958
The author aside, there's probably
an informant in the Central Committee.

14:50.042 --> 14:51.292
R-Ridiculous!

14:55.292 --> 14:58.292
There's an electromagnetic shield
under the body's surface?

14:58.375 --> 14:59.917
It's not a normal organism?

15:00.000 --> 15:03.292
No, its whole body is like a giant coil.

15:04.042 --> 15:04.958
Is that true?

15:05.417 --> 15:07.208
So, what happened in the end?

15:07.292 --> 15:08.583
It's kind of weird.

15:08.958 --> 15:13.083
A new Gematron code is using 80%
of the calculation server's power.

15:13.167 --> 15:14.250
Eighty percent?

15:14.333 --> 15:16.625
Isn't it the analysis for predictions?

15:16.708 --> 15:19.083
Still, for a simulation, it's too much.

15:20.208 --> 15:23.292
So, the rumor
of returning to Earth is true?

15:23.917 --> 15:26.292
It's 11.9 light years in one go.

15:26.500 --> 15:28.625
Is a subspace jump-warp even possible?

15:28.708 --> 15:31.542
It's not a problem
if we use Gematron calculation.

15:31.625 --> 15:33.750
I heard it directly from Navigation.

15:34.250 --> 15:35.917
Gematron, huh?

15:36.208 --> 15:38.833
The ship leaders turn to the gods,
as usual.

15:39.833 --> 15:44.375
Maybe even that new anti-Godzilla tactic
was a leak from the higher-ups?

15:44.667 --> 15:47.167
Man, are we going to fight it again?

15:47.833 --> 15:52.042
It's a monster that withstood an attack
of 150 nuclear warheads at once.

15:52.125 --> 15:54.375
That's 40 megatons of nucleoplasm total.

15:54.708 --> 15:58.833
But the thesis contained new strategies
on how to fight it.

15:58.917 --> 15:59.750
Huh?

16:12.458 --> 16:13.333
It's me.

16:13.833 --> 16:14.833
Hey, come in.

16:17.542 --> 16:21.833
So, the Central Committee is leaning
towards going to Earth, huh?

16:22.458 --> 16:23.458
Not entirely.

16:24.083 --> 16:27.042
To give up searching
for a habitable planet

16:27.125 --> 16:29.917
means someone has to bear
that responsibility.

16:30.333 --> 16:35.417
If they're so weak they give up drifting
after only 20 years, it can't be helped.

16:36.125 --> 16:37.958
Well, I do sympathize.

16:38.667 --> 16:43.417
They haven't dealt with the loss
of their home planet as long as we have.

16:44.042 --> 16:46.958
And then, there's your practical joke.

16:47.667 --> 16:49.875
Obviously, it's a headache for Mori.

16:50.708 --> 16:54.000
I uploaded a new version this morning.
Did you read it?

16:54.583 --> 16:59.083
Yeah. When I downloaded it,
it already had over 400 views.

16:59.333 --> 17:02.167
Though the file was deleted
three seconds later.

17:02.917 --> 17:05.833
Our delinquent captain sure is popular.

17:06.541 --> 17:10.916
When there's rumor of returning to Earth,
we get more talk of Godzilla.

17:11.041 --> 17:13.958
It's effective for ridiculing
the Central Committee.

17:15.000 --> 17:18.416
Haruo is unaware of
the Central Committee's expectations.

17:18.583 --> 17:22.041
He was researching Godzilla
purely for personal interest.

17:22.250 --> 17:27.500
But this thesis has content that will
support our plan to return to Earth.

17:28.583 --> 17:32.208
Its claim is that
Godzilla can be defeated by human hands.

17:32.708 --> 17:36.833
If you can't understand its contents,
it just sounds like crazy prattling.

17:37.083 --> 17:40.333
Earthlings harbor that much fear
of Godzilla.

17:41.250 --> 17:44.208
So, do you think
it's just crazy prattling?

17:45.125 --> 17:46.583
This analysis report?

17:47.208 --> 17:49.708
No, it's actually quite interesting.

17:50.625 --> 17:53.000
So much so, I think better of him.

17:53.542 --> 17:55.417
Godzilla is not invincible.

17:55.792 --> 17:59.083
It's humanity's fault for giving up
on the fight.

17:59.667 --> 18:01.208
That's what Haruo thinks.

18:02.500 --> 18:08.958
He analyzed that old data because
of you Exifs' Gematron calculation.

18:09.458 --> 18:12.250
It was impossible for Earthlings
at the time.

18:12.458 --> 18:15.958
Are you saying that, if the weak-point
analysis had been made in time,

18:16.083 --> 18:18.458
that humanity
still wouldn't have been victorious?

18:20.333 --> 18:22.375
And if they did defeat Godzilla,

18:23.083 --> 18:28.333
then it was only a matter of time
until Exif's cult took over Earth.

18:28.833 --> 18:32.583
Even if Bilusaludo's Mecha-Godzilla
had defeated Godzilla,

18:32.667 --> 18:35.958
no one knows
who it would have bared its fangs at next.

18:40.167 --> 18:43.583
However, we failed in the construction
of Mecha-Godzilla.

18:43.667 --> 18:47.083
And you couldn't brainwash Earthlings
with your religion.

18:47.292 --> 18:48.750
That's history now.

18:49.667 --> 18:52.208
The what-ifs are only fairy tales.

18:59.292 --> 19:02.250
Subspace jump-warp procedure,
now entering phase two.

19:02.333 --> 19:04.500
Activating shields for all ship sections.

19:04.583 --> 19:06.917
Bypassing electricity
for the gravitational coil engine.

19:07.000 --> 19:10.250
Initiating Gematron calculation
and gravitational coils controller.

19:10.458 --> 19:14.208
Begin cluster connections with Gematron
calculation crystal and central AI.

19:14.375 --> 19:17.708
Gravitational coil engine
for all sections functioning normally.

19:17.792 --> 19:19.000
Preparations for spin complete.

19:19.083 --> 19:23.167
Subspace coordinate system render
will be displayed on the central hologram.

19:23.500 --> 19:25.000
Attention all personnel.

19:25.208 --> 19:28.750
This ship, Aratrum,
will soon initiate subspace jump-warp.

19:29.417 --> 19:33.250
<i>Estimated emergence coordinates are near
the solar system's third planet, Earth.</i>

19:33.333 --> 19:37.167
<i>Based on the ship's time,
22 years have passed since our departure.</i>

19:37.250 --> 19:40.667
<i>This subspace jump-warp
will be the longest we've traversed.</i>

19:40.750 --> 19:43.292
Finally. The real Earth!

19:43.750 --> 19:45.875
I wonder if we can see the ocean?

19:46.792 --> 19:48.500
That'd be awesome if we can!

19:48.792 --> 19:52.125
The longest? Is this really safe?

19:52.208 --> 19:55.792
<i>...no idea what changes
Earth's environment has undergone.</i>

19:55.875 --> 19:57.042
<i>After an investigation,</i>

19:57.125 --> 20:01.750
<i>if we conclude the environment
has become unfit for human survival,</i>

20:01.833 --> 20:03.458
<i>we will collect resources...</i>

20:03.833 --> 20:06.833
Hey, is the real Earth
prettier than the hologram?

20:06.917 --> 20:08.708
Yes, it is.

20:09.958 --> 20:13.750
Entering Gematron-predicted coordinates.
Suspending main propulsion drive.

20:14.042 --> 20:16.375
We now have all the Gematron numbers.

20:16.458 --> 20:19.583
Irrational numbers converted to integers.
Computing time-space recon point.

20:19.833 --> 20:23.667
Chances of a wormhole appearing is 440%
in a simulated observation.

20:24.000 --> 20:27.167
Releasing gravitational coil output
for each section of the ship.

20:27.250 --> 20:28.125
Maximum spin.

20:33.500 --> 20:35.042
Captain, on your order.

20:37.833 --> 20:39.000
Initiate jump-warp.

20:39.750 --> 20:43.375
Jump-warp initiated. Commence shift
into phase one space travel.

21:01.250 --> 21:03.583
Gravitational coil at max speed,
running stable.

21:07.792 --> 21:10.375
Arriving at launch point
required for final trajectory.

21:13.125 --> 21:15.000
Breaking through subspace.

21:40.417 --> 21:41.333
Amazing.

21:42.125 --> 21:43.875
Hey, it's really blue!

21:43.958 --> 21:46.083
- That's the ocean?
- It's beautiful.

21:46.708 --> 21:47.667
That's Earth?

21:47.750 --> 21:49.417
Yes, that's right.

21:49.583 --> 21:50.958
It really is blue!

21:51.042 --> 21:54.000
To think that I'd see it again.

21:54.625 --> 21:58.375
Disabling shields in all sections.
Normal travel mode stable.

21:58.833 --> 22:01.167
Distance from Earth, 1,800 kilometers.

22:01.542 --> 22:04.125
Recalculating low orbit entrance errors.

22:11.167 --> 22:13.958
Our Earth that was taken from us.

22:17.125 --> 22:18.500
Orbit errors corrected.

22:18.583 --> 22:20.500
Now entering low Earth orbit.

22:21.208 --> 22:24.750
If we can't land on Earth,
we'll have a revolt on our hands.

22:25.292 --> 22:27.333
It's too soon to be pessimistic.

22:27.667 --> 22:30.250
Let's just wait for the scouting report.

22:30.583 --> 22:32.750
Unmanned recon drones
launching in sequence.

22:37.792 --> 22:40.208
All drone feedback systems are stable.

22:40.583 --> 22:43.542
Begin dispersion to specified areas
for surveillance.

22:47.417 --> 22:50.625
Entering the stratosphere.
Drone temperature stable.

22:52.042 --> 22:54.750
Altitude 30,000 meters, beginning descent.

22:56.292 --> 22:59.625
Altitude 15,000 meters,
entering the troposphere.

23:00.792 --> 23:02.792
Stellar observation parallax calculated.

23:03.000 --> 23:06.125
Elapsed time for the solar system
is approximately 10,000 years.

23:06.708 --> 23:08.667
It's been 10,000 years? That long?

23:08.750 --> 23:10.375
It's more than I imagined.

23:10.542 --> 23:12.167
This could be good news.

23:12.250 --> 23:15.542
With that much time,
the ecosystem must have changed.

23:15.625 --> 23:16.667
Not even Godzilla...

23:17.042 --> 23:17.875
I wonder.

23:18.417 --> 23:20.542
It's possible it could've multiplied.

23:20.625 --> 23:23.500
That thing is a genetic aberration.
It's impossible!

23:24.083 --> 23:27.708
Recon drones are at a scouting altitude
of 2,000 meters.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.083
Receiving visuals.

23:30.375 --> 23:32.792
Drone six displaying sound signal monitor.

23:34.500 --> 23:36.250
Just the sound of the wind?

23:36.333 --> 23:39.625
We can't see anything.
Can you lower the altitude?

23:39.708 --> 23:41.000
All drones descending.

23:41.958 --> 23:44.917
There are thick particles floating
in the atmosphere.

23:45.542 --> 23:47.625
Average visibility less than 300 meters.

23:48.667 --> 23:51.458
This is...
Picking up electromagnetic interference.

23:51.792 --> 23:53.417
This isn't just a normal fog.

23:53.500 --> 23:55.792
Switching drones to sensor monitors.

23:59.083 --> 24:01.208
Each drone's altitude at 500 meters.

24:01.292 --> 24:03.208
Atmospheric density is increasing.

24:03.292 --> 24:05.917
Further descent by remote is impossible.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.042
Is this a forest?

24:08.833 --> 24:10.917
Or some kind of complicated terrain.

24:11.375 --> 24:13.250
Can you increase the scan power?

24:13.833 --> 24:16.625
Its reflection is diffused,
so this is the limit.

24:18.708 --> 24:19.542
What's that?

24:20.417 --> 24:21.333
It's moving.

24:21.583 --> 24:24.375
Drone six,
switching to sound wave reconnaissance.

24:25.292 --> 24:28.125
Temperature around drone six
is increasing drastically!

24:29.208 --> 24:30.792
- What?
- What's happening?

24:38.500 --> 24:39.958
Drone six, lost!

24:40.500 --> 24:44.667
Estimated energy output around drone six
approximately 180 gigawatts.

24:45.333 --> 24:48.500
High probability of high-energy
electron particles, or atomic breath!

24:53.042 --> 24:55.417
M-Maybe it was thunder or...

24:55.500 --> 24:58.833
Idiot! No one would ever forget that roar!

25:00.583 --> 25:04.583
Damn it. It's still on this planet.

25:12.625 --> 25:14.250
You're there, aren't you?

25:15.958 --> 25:17.625
You're still there!

25:23.167 --> 25:27.292
If the characteristics match this closely,
then that was Godzilla,

25:27.375 --> 25:30.875
or a threat similar to it,
and it must be eliminated.

25:31.750 --> 25:37.042
Our one advantage is that it acts
independently rather than in a pack.

25:37.292 --> 25:39.417
How can you say that for sure?

25:39.750 --> 25:41.458
The concentration of radiation.

25:42.542 --> 25:47.958
As you're aware, Godzilla is a creature
that scatters heavy radiation in its wake.

25:48.583 --> 25:52.458
However, even though the terrain
has undergone change,

25:52.542 --> 25:56.167
the toxins present in the atmosphere
are maintaining stable numbers.

25:56.250 --> 26:00.167
If we reverse calculate the emission data
gathered in the past three days,

26:00.708 --> 26:04.000
multiple Godzillas seem unlikely.

26:04.958 --> 26:08.250
Even now,
Godzilla is a unique genetic defect

26:08.792 --> 26:12.917
and cannot be considered
a normal living creature, is what I mean.

26:13.500 --> 26:17.250
However, it's been 10,000 years.
How can it still be alive?

26:18.042 --> 26:21.417
There are cases where lotus seeds survived
for 2,000 years.

26:21.667 --> 26:26.167
It also may be repeating cycles
of dormancy every few thousand years.

26:26.417 --> 26:29.125
Or, over 10,000 years,
it could have multiplied

26:29.417 --> 26:33.333
and diminished in number,
with this being the last surviving one.

26:34.042 --> 26:39.042
Godzilla's biology is beyond
every known aspect of life science.

26:39.375 --> 26:43.333
And we can't ignore the possibility
that it could be immortal.

26:43.625 --> 26:47.083
Studies and research
aren't this meeting's main subject.

26:47.583 --> 26:50.792
We humanoids cannot coexist with Godzilla.

26:51.625 --> 26:55.500
However, if that is indeed Godzilla,
and the last one,

26:56.083 --> 26:57.833
then there is only one option.

26:59.208 --> 27:00.667
Complete extermination.

27:01.083 --> 27:03.250
Are you utterly insane?

27:03.958 --> 27:09.500
As you are all aware,
we have drafted anti-Godzilla strategies.

27:11.208 --> 27:13.167
You mean that anonymous thesis?

27:13.250 --> 27:15.375
We don't even know who wrote it!

27:17.667 --> 27:20.125
It's from a specialist's investigation.

27:20.208 --> 27:22.708
It's deemed as promising information.

27:22.917 --> 27:29.625
I am also prepared to release the name
of the person who wrote it, right here.

27:30.708 --> 27:32.833
However, there are conditions.

27:33.083 --> 27:35.417
And what would those conditions be?

27:35.750 --> 27:40.208
To drop the charges regarding
the stolen secret information, and then...

27:41.250 --> 27:43.208
release Captain Haruo Sakaki on bail.

27:43.875 --> 27:46.167
Captain Sakaki? It was him?

27:47.167 --> 27:49.417
You got us, Metphies.

27:51.917 --> 27:55.083
All shall be according to God's will.

28:09.000 --> 28:09.958
It's your turn.

28:11.000 --> 28:11.833
Haruo.

28:14.708 --> 28:18.958
It's here. This waveform is generating
the electromagnetic metamaterial.

28:19.667 --> 28:24.042
Since each of Godzilla's cells
can function as a powerful electromagnet,

28:24.500 --> 28:27.583
it emits a high-output,
high-frequency electromagnetic pulse

28:27.667 --> 28:30.583
and generates
an asymmetrically permeable shield.

28:30.833 --> 28:33.125
A physically impervious shield?

28:34.292 --> 28:37.583
It may be enormous,
but can a creature even do that?

28:37.917 --> 28:41.792
And if that were true,
how can we even begin to fight it?

28:42.333 --> 28:46.583
It's only for about 1/10,000 of a second,
but it emits a noise periodically.

28:46.667 --> 28:49.833
If we use an interference wave,
we can amplify that noise

28:49.917 --> 28:54.917
to fracture the metamaterial,
and we'll target that point.

28:55.417 --> 29:00.375
So by attacking a single point,
we can take that colossal thing down?

29:00.917 --> 29:04.417
There should be an organ
amplifying the electromagnetic pulse.

29:04.500 --> 29:07.458
If we destroy that,
we can neutralize the shield.

29:07.833 --> 29:09.000
And where is it?

29:09.458 --> 29:10.292
Unknown.

29:10.625 --> 29:13.667
There isn't enough data
in our visual records.

29:13.875 --> 29:18.125
We need to observe Godzilla
and analyze the emission pattern.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.292
As you know from past battles,

29:21.500 --> 29:25.125
we can confirm Godzilla has
tremendous regenerative abilities.

29:25.625 --> 29:30.500
The destroyed organs will regenerate, and
in the seconds before the shield goes up,

29:30.792 --> 29:35.042
we need to shove an EMP probe
into its body and destroy it from within.

29:35.458 --> 29:38.875
The main issue with this operation
is the changed atmosphere,

29:38.958 --> 29:41.708
and the electromagnetic wave interference.

29:42.292 --> 29:44.667
To observe and find Godzilla's weak point,

29:44.750 --> 29:47.667
we need detailed coordination
with accurate attacks,

29:47.958 --> 29:50.167
so close quarters combat is required.

29:50.458 --> 29:51.875
And for each process,

29:52.208 --> 29:55.083
we need manpower,
otherwise we cannot succeed.

29:55.375 --> 29:56.292
Preposterous!

29:56.833 --> 30:00.708
Even if we gather all the races,
there are only 4,000 of us.

30:01.125 --> 30:04.167
I cannot approve an operation
where lives can be lost.

30:04.750 --> 30:05.958
Captain Sakaki.

30:06.042 --> 30:07.792
I'll be blunt.

30:08.333 --> 30:12.750
In order for your operation to work,
how many people do you need?

30:13.417 --> 30:17.458
Combat engineers, infantry,
and special forces, so three battalions.

30:17.750 --> 30:20.208
If I form two companies from each,

30:20.292 --> 30:22.500
we're looking at about 600 people.

30:24.292 --> 30:25.667
Out of the question.

30:30.875 --> 30:34.125
Those who do not fight,
know not how to fight evil.

30:34.208 --> 30:38.417
Those gathered now, unified as one,
shall come to know God's mercy.

30:39.000 --> 30:43.167
Give praise to God.
All shall lead down the devoted path.

30:43.667 --> 30:47.833
Garbetrium guidance be with you all.

30:49.792 --> 30:53.958
<i>This is Colonel Elliot Leland,
commander of the Earth Landing Brigade.</i>

30:54.042 --> 30:56.333
<i>Everyone, continue your tasks and listen.</i>

30:57.792 --> 31:01.042
<i>All 600 gathered here
are the chosen elite forces</i>

31:01.125 --> 31:05.958
<i>who have decided to give their lives
to fight against Godzilla.</i>

31:07.333 --> 31:09.292
<i>Everyone correctly understands</i>

31:10.333 --> 31:15.333
<i>that there will be no constructive outlook
if you're trapped in an old society.</i>

31:16.125 --> 31:17.958
<i>Instead of a fake promised land,</i>

31:18.500 --> 31:20.625
we will take back our homeland,

31:21.333 --> 31:23.958
and promise prosperity
to the next generation.

31:24.917 --> 31:29.458
For the sake of humanity's future,
I look forward to everyone's efforts.

31:37.250 --> 31:40.208
All assembled landing ships
have exited the gates.

31:40.750 --> 31:43.583
Now closing the first launch gate station.

31:47.125 --> 31:51.250
That speech sounded like you wanted
to pick a fight with the Committee.

31:52.875 --> 31:53.708
Hey, Haruo.

31:54.583 --> 31:58.875
Didn't you also want to get
the Committee members frustrated?

31:59.792 --> 32:03.708
With the current system,
those members will just dry up and die.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.875
There aren't any comfortable chairs
for us.

32:07.500 --> 32:11.208
But if we defeat Godzilla,
then the story will be different.

32:11.833 --> 32:13.750
A new hero will arrive.

32:14.583 --> 32:15.875
Our era will come.

32:17.167 --> 32:18.250
A hero, huh?

32:18.792 --> 32:20.875
You're just like when you were a kid.

32:22.375 --> 32:25.792
Don't take it the wrong way.
You're still on bail status.

32:26.333 --> 32:29.250
We went through a lot
just to get you back out.

32:29.333 --> 32:30.167
Commander.

32:30.542 --> 32:33.750
All landing ships have assembled
in low orbit.

32:35.500 --> 32:37.750
All ships, enter in sequential order.

32:37.833 --> 32:38.667
<i>Roger.</i>

32:39.250 --> 32:41.750
<i>All ships,
begin entry in sequential order.</i>

32:45.292 --> 32:47.125
Ship ten, ignite engine.

32:47.500 --> 32:49.958
Deploy anti-aerodynamic drag
and heat shield.

32:52.292 --> 32:53.583
You look unhappy.

32:53.875 --> 32:56.125
Even though your wish is being granted.

32:56.208 --> 32:59.292
I wonder if everything will go
according to plan.

32:59.958 --> 33:03.917
It'll be okay. As long as we have the hero
who will guide them.

33:05.083 --> 33:06.792
Are you a Leland sympathizer?

33:07.167 --> 33:11.125
Well, the one I put my hope in
is you,

33:11.833 --> 33:12.667
Haruo.

33:15.000 --> 33:18.708
The one true path to glory
can only be opened through devotion.

33:19.750 --> 33:22.208
This is our, the Exif's, creed.

33:23.167 --> 33:26.083
There are only a few Earthlings
who embody that.

33:26.750 --> 33:29.042
You're a rare exception.

33:30.292 --> 33:31.667
You overestimate me.

33:33.167 --> 33:36.250
You are the one who is worthy
of fighting Godzilla.

33:36.958 --> 33:40.250
The time will come soon enough
when that can be proven.

33:51.042 --> 33:52.458
Ship temperature stable.

33:54.625 --> 33:56.583
Passing the stratosphere.

33:56.833 --> 33:58.375
Altitude 30,000 meters.

33:58.792 --> 34:01.250
Igniting arc jet thrusters for cruising.

34:11.542 --> 34:15.583
Once we go under those clouds,
we won't see the sun anymore, huh?

34:15.792 --> 34:18.542
This planet has been
completely changed, too.

34:19.958 --> 34:21.667
Now entering the troposphere.

34:23.167 --> 34:27.083
Altitude 2,000. All ships,
begin navigating towards landing zone.

34:28.208 --> 34:29.833
The visibility's terrible.

34:30.250 --> 34:32.667
Switching the ship's probes to ultrasonic.

34:33.083 --> 34:34.458
Begin image processing.

34:35.917 --> 34:38.250
Company A, landing zone confirmed.

34:38.500 --> 34:39.833
Obstacles detected.

34:40.125 --> 34:44.042
As the reconnaissance drones reported,
this is a thick forest.

34:44.125 --> 34:47.875
Securing landing point now.
Prepare the thermobaric bombs.

34:47.958 --> 34:50.417
Roger. Dropping thermo-pressure warheads.

35:02.583 --> 35:04.458
They're being grandiose over there.

35:04.542 --> 35:07.667
Well, the special forces will land
on impeded terrain.

35:08.458 --> 35:09.292
What?

35:09.708 --> 35:12.417
An obstacle collided
with the ship's exterior.

35:12.958 --> 35:15.833
No issues so far with power and steering.

35:16.208 --> 35:17.500
An obstacle?

35:28.083 --> 35:31.333
Lieutenant Colonel Galu-gu,
Company E has also landed.

35:31.958 --> 35:34.792
We will now set
the combat engineers' traps.

35:34.875 --> 35:35.708
Okay.

35:38.042 --> 35:39.833
The old Tanzawa Pass, huh?

35:41.208 --> 35:43.667
If it was sunny,
it would've been beautiful.

35:44.542 --> 35:48.292
With this heavy fog,
a visual battle would be impossible.

35:50.208 --> 35:52.875
Lieutenant Colonel Galu-gu, please look.

35:52.958 --> 35:53.875
This is...

35:54.042 --> 35:56.708
Doesn't it look like
something scratched it?

35:57.375 --> 36:00.208
I hope the others are okay out there.

36:01.875 --> 36:03.792
Get the transmission balloons!

36:03.875 --> 36:06.583
You don't need to unload
the medical supplies.

36:15.958 --> 36:17.875
Transmission balloon reception favorable.

36:18.625 --> 36:23.250
Companies B and C special force units
will reach their destination on schedule.

36:23.875 --> 36:28.750
Companies D and E will deploy artillery
as the combat engineers lay down traps.

36:29.125 --> 36:32.583
Okay, the first battle formation
is going according to plan.

36:33.125 --> 36:37.542
Whichever company finds Godzilla first,
open fire with the special forces.

36:37.625 --> 36:39.542
Provoke it and divert its course.

36:39.875 --> 36:45.208
What's important is to observe Godzilla's
electromagnetic waves when it's attacked.

36:45.792 --> 36:50.667
We'll analyze this data to see which organ
emits the electromagnetic wave.

36:51.000 --> 36:55.333
Once we destroy that, we can neutralize
the asymmetrically permeable shield.

36:56.208 --> 37:00.167
And finally, we'll chase Godzilla
into this Tanzawa Pass,

37:00.292 --> 37:03.208
and slow it
with traps set by the engineers.

37:03.292 --> 37:06.667
The artillery unit will then open fire
from a close range.

37:06.875 --> 37:12.042
We'll amplify the pulse noise,
attack all at once, and destroy the organ.

37:12.875 --> 37:18.000
The shield will go down for a few seconds,
and then we'll use EMP probes to end it.

37:19.083 --> 37:23.167
If we can't find the amplifying organ,
we can't place the infantry.

37:23.458 --> 37:24.458
Exactly.

37:25.208 --> 37:29.417
The special forces analysis of the pattern
will influence the plan.

37:29.750 --> 37:34.500
So they'll spread out into a wide area,
and advance while analyzing the enemy.

37:35.292 --> 37:36.292
Cooperation is key.

37:36.792 --> 37:42.167
But who knew we'd have to rely
on something this pathetic to communicate?

37:43.208 --> 37:46.125
If we can transmit
through this convection cloud,

37:46.208 --> 37:50.458
the drones in the stratosphere will relay
our communication with no issues.

37:50.792 --> 37:54.500
But in this fog,
electronic communication will be limited.

37:54.917 --> 37:57.833
What is going on
with this planet's atmosphere?

37:58.125 --> 38:00.583
That's what we're trying to find out.

38:01.375 --> 38:04.208
Colonel, I'd like to form
an investigation team.

38:04.792 --> 38:07.125
If I can borrow three teams, as planned.

38:07.208 --> 38:10.875
The scouting team takes priority.
I'll give you two teams.

38:11.583 --> 38:12.583
All right, then.

38:12.667 --> 38:17.458
I'd like to go, too. I want to see with
my own eyes how this terrain has changed.

38:17.542 --> 38:18.708
You heard him.

38:19.042 --> 38:21.667
- Master Sergeant Yuko Tani, you're up.
- Yuko?

38:25.000 --> 38:30.167
You'll be his handler.
As you know, he's been released on bail.

38:30.708 --> 38:32.500
So be careful handling him.

38:32.875 --> 38:33.708
Understood.

38:53.250 --> 38:57.875
Unbelievable. Are these really the plants
growing on Earth?

38:58.417 --> 39:01.667
Is this what I saw in the ship's records?
Trees, was it?

39:01.958 --> 39:03.583
They look different, though.

39:19.167 --> 39:20.208
Don't touch it!

39:23.250 --> 39:25.583
In some places they're sharp as razors.

39:26.250 --> 39:29.458
It'd be deadly
if your airtight suit got a hole in it.

39:48.750 --> 39:51.250
Why did you request to join this mission?

39:51.708 --> 39:56.375
Because you're involved, Captain Sakaki,
and set up the operation.

39:56.958 --> 39:59.917
Please don't call me that.
Just Haruo is fine.

40:02.417 --> 40:06.458
I've always wanted to meet you
so we could speak in person.

40:07.417 --> 40:12.958
I wondered if it's because of you, Cap...
Haruo, that grandpa died at Tau-e.

40:13.250 --> 40:14.083
I...

40:14.417 --> 40:17.417
The bombs that you brought
inside the shuttle,

40:17.583 --> 40:22.167
I heard from security
that they were definitely all removed.

40:23.000 --> 40:24.917
But then the emigration group...

40:26.083 --> 40:27.875
Do you think it was an accident?

40:29.250 --> 40:31.083
You don't think it was?

40:32.292 --> 40:36.833
You said the Central Committee
wanted to reduce passengers.

40:37.583 --> 40:41.292
They could have used some trick
so the emigration group wouldn't...

40:41.375 --> 40:43.708
The Central Committee isn't that corrupt!

40:45.000 --> 40:49.125
That's what I want to think. I don't
want to be suspicious of my comrades.

40:49.708 --> 40:50.625
Haruo.

40:52.583 --> 40:57.167
No, that's not it. I couldn't forgive
myself for wanting to be suspicious.

40:57.458 --> 41:00.167
I don't want to be so judgmental
of humans.

41:00.625 --> 41:05.167
But being on that claustrophobic ship
and living on minimal supplies,

41:05.458 --> 41:08.000
it's normal for people
to become mistrustful.

41:09.667 --> 41:13.542
Godzilla didn't just steal Earth
away from us.

41:14.375 --> 41:18.000
Justice, faith, and the basic pride
we have as humans...

41:18.917 --> 41:20.875
we've come to lose them, too.

41:22.708 --> 41:26.167
And that's why
we need to fight Godzilla again.

41:27.625 --> 41:30.167
So we can take back the dignity we lost.

41:37.042 --> 41:37.875
This is...

41:38.333 --> 41:39.875
<i>Professor! Please come!</i>

41:41.625 --> 41:42.458
Over there!

41:48.500 --> 41:49.417
Ruins?

41:51.083 --> 41:54.417
But they couldn't have lasted
10,000 years.

41:55.792 --> 41:57.000
Captain Sakaki!

42:03.000 --> 42:03.833
I see.

42:05.208 --> 42:09.667
The lichen used the building's surface
as a seedbed and became fossilized.

42:10.083 --> 42:12.875
Afterwards,
the building materials weathered away,

42:12.958 --> 42:16.333
but the fossilized fungus
must have retained the shape.

42:17.375 --> 42:22.042
This is Earth's civilization.
People used to live here?

42:25.458 --> 42:26.458
Haruo?

42:27.833 --> 42:28.792
It remembered.

42:30.333 --> 42:37.250
Although we've forgotten,
this planet has always remembered us.

42:40.833 --> 42:45.125
Of course. Even after undergoing change,
this is still our Mother Earth.

42:46.000 --> 42:47.958
The planet that belongs to humans.

42:48.958 --> 42:51.792
We'll take it back... no matter what.

42:54.375 --> 42:55.500
With our own hands.

43:01.958 --> 43:05.125
Where's the scouting team?
Haven't they responded yet?

43:05.250 --> 43:07.500
It's probably the electromagnetic waves.

43:07.583 --> 43:09.708
The reception area
is five kilometers, right?

43:09.792 --> 43:10.625
Yes.

43:10.875 --> 43:13.375
Unexpected atmospheric changes
are also possible.

43:13.458 --> 43:16.417
There are reports of geomagnetic storms.

43:16.667 --> 43:20.083
But we're connected with
Martin's investigation team. It's strange!

43:30.000 --> 43:31.000
Hey, what's that?

43:31.083 --> 43:32.458
Is it the scouting team?

44:00.583 --> 44:01.417
What?

44:02.292 --> 44:03.792
Damn it! Kill it!

44:10.083 --> 44:12.208
- What?
- Something happened at the camp!

44:12.292 --> 44:14.458
- Professor Martin!
- Let's go back, now!

44:34.417 --> 44:38.750
This doesn't correspond to any
of Earth's primary species records.

44:39.500 --> 44:41.667
It must be a sudden variant,

44:41.958 --> 44:46.000
otherwise, how could something evolve
into a form like this?

44:47.250 --> 44:49.542
Would living organisms
go through such a change,

44:49.625 --> 44:52.083
even if 10,000 years have passed?

44:52.667 --> 44:55.083
We collected
and analyzed the forest's plants,

44:55.792 --> 44:59.458
and by using carbon dating,
I know how much time has passed.

44:59.833 --> 45:04.375
And it looks to be within a 50-year range
of 19,200 years.

45:04.917 --> 45:07.500
So our time away keeps increasing.

45:08.250 --> 45:12.958
The special cell characteristics of this
beast and the plants are interesting.

45:14.583 --> 45:15.917
Okay, it came off.

45:18.458 --> 45:23.083
The flora and fauna have differences,
but also similar, wide-ranging traits.

45:23.542 --> 45:26.625
Along with characteristics
very similar to metal,

45:26.708 --> 45:29.458
they have bodily functions
that exert powerful magnetism.

45:29.875 --> 45:31.125
The same as Godzilla?

45:31.208 --> 45:36.625
Yes. This beast is small, but it may be
in the same family as Godzilla.

45:37.250 --> 45:41.917
What's surprising is that the plants also
have strikingly similar characteristics.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.917
So this fog causing
the electromagnetic disturbance...

45:45.750 --> 45:49.500
The particles in the air
are the pollen of this forest's plants.

45:49.667 --> 45:52.417
It could also be their natural chaff.

45:52.667 --> 45:56.000
If the fog's caused by the organisms
and not the weather,

45:56.083 --> 46:00.333
we have to burn the entire forest down
to disperse this fog?

46:00.875 --> 46:04.875
So, we have no choice
but to abandon our first plan of waiting

46:05.375 --> 46:08.250
for the weather to clear up a bit
before we attack.

46:08.333 --> 46:09.542
That's not all.

46:09.792 --> 46:12.250
If dangerous beasts are wandering around,

46:12.333 --> 46:14.958
I have to split up our troops
for camp defense.

46:15.042 --> 46:18.333
We can reassign groups
to join the special forces.

46:18.417 --> 46:19.542
Don't be ridiculous!

46:20.083 --> 46:24.042
You want everyone to wander in
this unknown environment without a plan?

46:24.125 --> 46:25.542
Then what's your plan?

46:26.375 --> 46:27.208
Retreat.

46:28.542 --> 46:30.708
Logically, that's our only choice.

46:30.792 --> 46:32.083
What are you saying?

46:32.833 --> 46:36.458
The water and plants are toxic,
and the wild animals are hostile.

46:36.542 --> 46:39.708
The only benefits here
are air pressure and gravity.

46:40.167 --> 46:44.625
It'd be the height of stupidity
to fight Godzilla to reclaim this planet.

46:46.417 --> 46:49.042
This is our home!

46:49.917 --> 46:53.042
You're giving up?
Not only once, but twice?

46:54.125 --> 46:58.917
We can settle on the surface of the moon,
and collect resources from Earth.

46:59.042 --> 47:02.833
If we're thinking about safety,
it's a more realistic plan.

47:02.917 --> 47:07.375
Weren't you going to defeat Godzilla
and become a hero?

47:08.167 --> 47:12.167
I underestimated the situation.
My eyes are open now and I've learned!

47:12.250 --> 47:14.542
You're going to be a coward now?

47:15.458 --> 47:19.833
From wild beasts alone,
we have 12 dead and 35 critically injured!

47:19.917 --> 47:22.750
Without even seeing Godzilla,
this is the outcome!

47:22.875 --> 47:27.208
We can't play war with new soldiers
who've never fought in actual combat.

47:28.625 --> 47:29.542
Retreat?

47:30.500 --> 47:35.417
I do agree with the commander's decision,
but the problem is, how do we retreat?

47:36.500 --> 47:37.708
That attack just now

47:38.042 --> 47:41.792
left us with heavier equipment loss
than human casualties.

47:42.000 --> 47:42.833
Is that so?

47:43.958 --> 47:48.917
Frustratingly, those lizard things
destroyed four landing ships.

47:49.292 --> 47:54.667
Ship one and two's fuel systems and
ship three and four's engines are dead.

47:54.750 --> 47:58.542
We can't return to the mother ship
orbiting this planet anymore.

47:59.208 --> 48:02.625
If that's the case,
we need to gather Company A,

48:02.792 --> 48:08.042
and join the company with enough
transit power to get us all back to space.

48:09.125 --> 48:12.875
Companies B and C are special forces
like us, so they can't do it.

48:13.083 --> 48:17.125
So we must join the artillery unit
and the trap materials unit,

48:17.208 --> 48:19.667
which are Companies D and E.

48:20.625 --> 48:25.625
In order for us to escape
the wild animals' habitat,

48:26.250 --> 48:29.375
we must move through
this old Tanzawa Pass.

48:30.125 --> 48:35.167
And our first plan was to go through
the projected encounter area for Godzilla.

48:38.000 --> 48:39.375
That's correct.

48:40.250 --> 48:43.500
We need to pass the area
where Godzilla appears frequently.

48:43.833 --> 48:49.875
Of course, if we run into Godzilla,
that would be extremely awful for us.

48:50.375 --> 48:52.292
In order to secure safe passage...

48:53.292 --> 48:56.542
We would need backup
from Companies B and C.

48:57.042 --> 49:02.250
However, if we join up and form a cluster,
we'll be open to an atomic breath attack.

49:03.042 --> 49:04.750
What's the safest plan?

49:05.792 --> 49:07.375
While remaining spread out,

49:07.458 --> 49:12.667
repeatedly reciprocate the threat
and keep securing each other's safety.

49:13.042 --> 49:17.750
Yes. This is, however, quite close
to Captain Sakaki's original plan,

49:18.208 --> 49:20.875
with very few changes.

49:24.167 --> 49:27.875
Listen here.
This is a retreat tactic, no matter what.

49:28.292 --> 49:31.208
We will not take any action
to lure out Godzilla.

49:32.208 --> 49:36.583
Once all units reach the gathering point,
we complete the mission,

49:36.792 --> 49:38.542
and return to the mother ship.

49:39.792 --> 49:41.375
Be careful of that crack.

49:42.917 --> 49:44.792
Okay, that's good. This way!

49:45.167 --> 49:48.708
There's no fuse,
but it could still explode, so be careful.

49:49.208 --> 49:51.708
- That's a high explosive. Be careful.
- Yeah.

49:52.667 --> 49:56.292
<i>Company B, C, and all landing ships,
heading to Company D camp.</i>

49:56.375 --> 49:58.708
- <i>Confirm landing zone.</i>
- <i>Landing zone confirmed.</i>

49:58.792 --> 50:01.250
<i>All ships rotate bearing
to 202.5 degrees.</i>

50:01.333 --> 50:02.583
- <i>Marker lock.</i>
- <i>Roger.</i>

50:03.458 --> 50:05.083
So what's the situation?

50:05.167 --> 50:07.375
Company B, Company C reserves,

50:07.458 --> 50:12.375
and Company A hover squads
are to join with Company D and stand by.

50:12.875 --> 50:16.417
What's going on? Is the plan a go, or no?

50:16.958 --> 50:20.042
Based on Commander Leland's orders
to the hover squads,

50:20.125 --> 50:22.542
special forces
will abandon the base camps.

50:22.625 --> 50:26.375
After all units reach the final
gathering point, we'll retreat.

50:27.250 --> 50:31.042
We'll follow our original path,
but we won't search for Godzilla.

50:31.125 --> 50:37.125
So, what? Did we come down to Earth
just to display our marching orders?

50:37.500 --> 50:40.500
Company A's damage
must have been that severe.

50:40.917 --> 50:44.125
I heard there were
smaller Godzilla-like creatures.

50:44.333 --> 50:47.208
They were strong enough
to destroy a power suit.

50:47.542 --> 50:51.375
Leland, that coward. If he's going
to go along with Haruo's madness,

50:51.458 --> 50:54.208
he has to resign himself
from the beginning.

50:56.125 --> 50:58.792
They had us design this,

50:59.000 --> 51:02.542
and now we have to abandon it
because of overcapacity?

51:06.917 --> 51:09.792
Approaching Godzilla's
projected contact area.

51:10.042 --> 51:13.167
Hurry! We need to
get through this area quickly!

51:17.708 --> 51:20.167
Can't this thing pump out any more speed?

51:20.708 --> 51:23.500
By shifting parts around,
we got ship two moving.

51:24.208 --> 51:26.500
It's all we can do to keep it hovering.

51:26.958 --> 51:29.292
I guess I'm thankful that it's moving.

51:29.708 --> 51:32.583
I wouldn't want to walk through
this forest at all.

51:33.208 --> 51:35.375
Are you having foreboding thoughts?

51:36.208 --> 51:40.750
If this ends without us encountering
Godzilla, then why did I come here?

51:41.958 --> 51:44.083
Were you hoping to depend on luck?

51:44.667 --> 51:46.833
It's fine if we're actively searching,

51:46.917 --> 51:51.167
but if we pass by in a rush,
then we won't even find anything.

51:51.333 --> 51:56.417
That's if we were actively searching
for Godzilla, right?

51:57.625 --> 51:59.000
You and Colonel Leland

51:59.583 --> 52:02.917
still don't understand one crucial aspect
of that thing.

52:04.125 --> 52:06.542
It will never let humanity escape.

52:06.667 --> 52:10.542
Even more so if we've come to provoke it
without a trace of fear.

52:11.042 --> 52:13.167
So, it will be searching for us?

52:15.000 --> 52:17.958
Is that some divine message from god?

52:18.583 --> 52:19.458
It's a legend.

52:20.333 --> 52:24.542
We Exif have been wandering
through space as vagrants

52:24.625 --> 52:26.458
far longer than Earthlings have,

52:26.542 --> 52:29.417
and we've witnessed
many civilizations destroyed.

52:30.167 --> 52:36.333
Many have been regretfully destroyed
by creatures similar to Godzilla.

52:36.792 --> 52:37.625
What's that?

52:38.417 --> 52:41.667
He is the punishing iron hammer
for the arrogant.

52:42.458 --> 52:45.917
For the species who pronounce themselves
as lords of creation,

52:46.083 --> 52:48.542
a divine avenger will pay them a visit.

52:49.167 --> 52:50.250
And so, he will...

52:53.708 --> 52:54.750
What was that?

52:55.667 --> 52:56.583
An earthquake?

53:05.875 --> 53:08.667
Sound wave analysis!
All units, prepare for battle!

53:12.042 --> 53:15.042
Movement detected at two o'clock!
It's approaching!

53:24.292 --> 53:25.833
Evade! Evade, now!

53:35.167 --> 53:36.625
We can't evade in time!

53:52.625 --> 53:53.833
Run, Haruo.

53:55.333 --> 53:57.125
Do as your soul cries out to do.

53:57.875 --> 53:58.708
Yeah.

54:16.958 --> 54:19.500
The propellant is leaking!
It's going to explode!

54:46.000 --> 54:46.833
Hurry!

54:59.792 --> 55:01.375
I'll get you for this!

55:04.333 --> 55:05.292
That idiot.

55:05.958 --> 55:07.375
Haruo, why?

55:07.875 --> 55:11.792
He's going to record the moment
Godzilla activates its shield.

55:12.292 --> 55:14.750
And to do that, you have to attack it.

55:19.458 --> 55:23.250
Damn it, the electromagnetic sensor
isn't responding. Why?

55:25.833 --> 55:27.500
What are you doing? Let's go!

55:27.875 --> 55:29.417
But then, Captain Sakaki...

55:31.417 --> 55:32.708
Then, get out.

55:33.583 --> 55:36.625
Again! This time, at a closer distance!

55:39.792 --> 55:41.167
Damn it!

55:41.333 --> 55:42.167
I see.

55:42.625 --> 55:45.958
Such light damage
won't cause the shield to activate.

55:46.292 --> 55:47.333
Professor Martin!

55:48.083 --> 55:51.083
<i>Please record this next attack
with the sensor.</i>

55:51.417 --> 55:53.208
Captain! What's your plan?

55:53.292 --> 55:56.417
<i>I'm going to nose-dive
and slam into it.</i>

55:56.958 --> 55:57.792
What?

56:04.167 --> 56:07.000
You bastard, I will...

56:18.792 --> 56:19.833
What?

56:38.208 --> 56:40.125
This planet can go to hell.

56:52.375 --> 56:53.208
Leland.

57:18.250 --> 57:20.000
Colonel Leland was killed?

57:20.292 --> 57:25.250
<i>Yes. According to rank,
the command will now fall to me, though...</i>

57:25.750 --> 57:26.583
Can you do it?

57:26.917 --> 57:31.792
<i>I'll need to reassign a subordinate
who has disobeyed military regulations.</i>

57:31.875 --> 57:34.375
<i>This is an emergency,
so please understand.</i>

57:35.042 --> 57:38.750
For this occasion, fine.
Bring back as many people as you can.

57:39.208 --> 57:40.208
<i>Understood.</i>

57:44.083 --> 57:46.375
Did you analyze the data sent to us?

57:46.458 --> 57:47.583
Finished just now.

57:48.208 --> 57:50.833
The electromagnetic metamaterial's
output has been recorded.

57:51.208 --> 57:54.000
Just as you surmised, a shield exists.

57:54.750 --> 57:56.958
The noise in question was confirmed.

57:57.542 --> 57:59.500
It's not unified across its body.

57:59.583 --> 58:01.667
There's clearly a concentrated spot.

58:01.750 --> 58:02.667
The dorsal fin?

58:03.125 --> 58:07.792
This is where the shield is generated.
Leland gave his life for this information.

58:10.083 --> 58:15.417
Everyone, during that earlier encounter,
Colonel Leland died an honorable death.

58:16.542 --> 58:20.208
And so,
as the Central Committee's direct priest,

58:20.542 --> 58:23.458
I have accepted full responsibility
for this operation.

58:24.417 --> 58:28.750
However, I cannot say that I am
the best man for this job.

58:30.208 --> 58:34.667
All people are born to accomplish the task
they were meant to do.

58:35.833 --> 58:38.458
This has been established
in our scriptures,

58:38.833 --> 58:43.625
and as I shoulder the burden of a priest,
I cannot turn my back to this truth.

58:44.583 --> 58:48.583
With the premise
of taking full responsibility,

58:49.208 --> 58:51.750
I will now entrust all decision-making...

58:53.958 --> 58:56.167
to Captain Sakaki, as the commander.

58:57.875 --> 58:59.958
Okay, Haruo.

59:01.042 --> 59:01.875
Your orders.

59:02.167 --> 59:03.250
But that's insane!

59:15.583 --> 59:18.750
The situation is dire,
so I'll skip the pleasantries.

59:19.625 --> 59:23.625
I don't have an outlook
for humanity's future,

59:24.083 --> 59:28.875
and I don't have enough of a strategy
to estimate our chances of winning.

59:29.792 --> 59:31.792
However, I can say this.

59:33.083 --> 59:37.208
Those who didn't yield to Godzilla
can proudly welcome another day.

59:38.333 --> 59:41.375
This is not only a battle
to kill Godzilla.

59:42.708 --> 59:45.917
What we are about to fight
is a humiliating future

59:46.375 --> 59:49.667
with no choice
but to accept despair and resignation.

59:50.958 --> 59:57.542
If we can reject and fight that,
we can once again dream of hope and pride.

59:58.500 --> 01:00:01.833
Just as our ancestors did,
who thrived here before us.

01:00:02.583 --> 01:00:06.167
That's right. If we don't retreat now,
if we don't show fear,

01:00:06.417 --> 01:00:10.000
and if we put our lives on the line,
we've already won.

01:00:10.625 --> 01:00:12.625
All we need to do is finish it.

01:00:13.708 --> 01:00:17.875
Humanity's 22-year-long nightmare,
and Godzilla's 20,000-year era.

01:00:20.792 --> 01:00:24.083
I look forward to your brave efforts.
That is all.

01:00:35.792 --> 01:00:37.375
We'll begin our operation.

01:00:37.458 --> 01:00:40.083
Yuko, you know Godzilla's position, right?

01:00:40.375 --> 01:00:43.375
Yes.
It's about 80 kilometers north-north-east.

01:00:43.458 --> 01:00:46.083
Moving southwest
at 40 kilometers an hour.

01:00:46.167 --> 01:00:49.875
Set up transmission balloons
every 3,000 meters on the battlefield.

01:00:50.458 --> 01:00:52.792
- We need optimal communicative reception.
- Roger.

01:00:52.875 --> 01:00:56.875
Major Belu-be, provoke Godzilla
from a distance and watch its reaction.

01:00:56.958 --> 01:00:58.542
Maintain that distance.

01:00:58.792 --> 01:01:00.125
Sure, leave it to me.

01:01:00.542 --> 01:01:02.458
Adam, watch for the atomic breath.

01:01:02.625 --> 01:01:04.875
If electric potential rises,
escape immediately.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:05.833
Understood.

01:01:06.375 --> 01:01:07.208
Galu-gu.

01:01:07.333 --> 01:01:11.292
I'll move to the trap point
and command the power suit team directly.

01:01:11.542 --> 01:01:12.375
What?

01:01:13.208 --> 01:01:16.833
I'll determine the EMP probes'
target point on-site.

01:01:17.375 --> 01:01:18.458
However...

01:01:18.875 --> 01:01:21.083
Galu-gu, how are the trap placements?

01:01:21.167 --> 01:01:22.792
All according to plan.

01:01:22.875 --> 01:01:25.333
Its weak point is the dorsal fin,
its back.

01:01:25.458 --> 01:01:28.708
Since we need to concentrate our fire
at a close distance,

01:01:28.792 --> 01:01:33.833
we have to let it pass the line of fire,
and lure it deeper into the valley.

01:01:34.458 --> 01:01:36.208
So we only have one chance.

01:01:36.333 --> 01:01:40.667
To make this plan work, we need
to place the traps deeper in the valley.

01:01:51.250 --> 01:01:53.417
Artillery units are all in position.

01:01:53.792 --> 01:01:54.625
We're ready.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.750
Can we really lure it
all the way out here?

01:01:57.833 --> 01:02:00.625
We have no choice but to believe in them.

01:02:03.833 --> 01:02:07.333
Power suit team, move to the trap point.
We'll stand by.

01:02:09.250 --> 01:02:11.833
I'm leaving the diversion to you, Belu-be.

01:02:12.375 --> 01:02:13.208
Roger.

01:02:15.625 --> 01:02:19.250
All squads, ascend to planned altitude.
Cross-delta pattern formation.

01:02:30.792 --> 01:02:33.000
Godzilla detected
at the projected contact area.

01:02:33.792 --> 01:02:36.208
All units, commence the diversion plan.

01:02:36.333 --> 01:02:38.083
Right wing, squad one, attack!

01:02:41.208 --> 01:02:42.917
Godzilla sighting confirmed!

01:02:43.125 --> 01:02:43.958
Fire!

01:02:46.917 --> 01:02:47.875
All units, turn!

01:02:57.583 --> 01:03:01.250
Ascend in battle formation.
We'll attack as long as possible!

01:03:09.792 --> 01:03:11.583
Target successfully diverted.

01:03:11.958 --> 01:03:13.167
We can do this!

01:03:17.250 --> 01:03:18.083
Evade!

01:03:23.250 --> 01:03:26.000
Damn it! Adam! Take the left wing!

01:03:26.167 --> 01:03:27.792
Roger, left wing, squad one.

01:03:27.875 --> 01:03:30.833
- The impact area is bigger!
- It's hard to evade!

01:03:30.917 --> 01:03:34.333
The evading maneuvers
are just a second delayed. Let's go!

01:03:43.917 --> 01:03:46.917
- Right wing, squad two, follow and attack!
- Roger!

01:04:00.083 --> 01:04:02.083
These guys aren't part of the plan!

01:04:02.625 --> 01:04:03.458
What's wrong?

01:04:03.542 --> 01:04:05.917
<i>Major Belu-be!
It's what attacked Company A!</i>

01:04:06.625 --> 01:04:10.208
What? All squads provide cover fire
from a higher altitude.

01:04:10.583 --> 01:04:13.542
Shoot them down
before more come from the forest!

01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:19.792
Left wing, squad two, counterattack!

01:04:32.667 --> 01:04:34.625
We have no time for the small fish.

01:04:34.958 --> 01:04:37.625
Left wing, squad two,
continue the diversion!

01:04:48.833 --> 01:04:50.250
<i>Belu-be, are you okay?</i>

01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:52.292
It seems like you're in trouble.

01:04:52.375 --> 01:04:56.625
<i>Like the simulations predicted,
we should be able to lure it to the spot.</i>

01:04:56.708 --> 01:04:58.167
<i>But we need more firepower.</i>

01:04:58.250 --> 01:05:01.125
It'll be night soon.
Can you hasten the process?

01:05:01.375 --> 01:05:04.625
<i>Ten have gone down.
Ammo and gas are almost depleted.</i>

01:05:05.083 --> 01:05:06.375
Adam. Do you copy?

01:05:07.167 --> 01:05:09.042
Yes. Captain, I copy.

01:05:09.542 --> 01:05:11.958
- <i>I'm reassigning you.</i>
- What, right now?

01:05:12.042 --> 01:05:15.000
I'm shortening the time allotted
to lure Godzilla.

01:05:15.083 --> 01:05:17.208
What? How can we do that?

01:05:17.875 --> 01:05:21.458
<i>I'll use the landing ships
for a bombardment to create a path.</i>

01:05:21.542 --> 01:05:24.125
What? Send the landing ships
to the frontline?

01:05:24.250 --> 01:05:25.375
It's too dangerous.

01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:28.917
If they get shot down,
how will we return to the mother ship?

01:05:29.292 --> 01:05:30.917
But we're already home.

01:05:31.750 --> 01:05:35.792
There's nowhere else to return to
but here. Isn't that right?

01:05:36.625 --> 01:05:38.167
Have you lost your mind?

01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:39.375
Let's do it.

01:05:39.708 --> 01:05:42.542
It'll be useless
to prepare an escape route.

01:05:43.042 --> 01:05:45.792
In order to win,
we need to play every hand.

01:05:46.542 --> 01:05:49.833
This is why belligerent species
are difficult to deal with.

01:05:50.208 --> 01:05:54.875
Adam, select five elite pilots.
Prepare the landing ships for takeoff.

01:05:55.208 --> 01:05:56.125
Roger.

01:05:56.208 --> 01:05:59.792
Major Belu-be, Second Lieutenant
Adam Bindewald, withdrawing!

01:06:00.208 --> 01:06:02.958
Hurry and go! We'll handle this somehow!

01:06:03.917 --> 01:06:06.042
Right wing, squad one, charge again!

01:06:09.292 --> 01:06:10.917
Don't fall behind!

01:06:23.417 --> 01:06:25.583
Six elite pilots, standing by!

01:06:26.125 --> 01:06:27.333
We can go anytime!

01:06:27.417 --> 01:06:29.667
<i>Load all ammunition, even the reserves.</i>

01:06:29.750 --> 01:06:31.167
If we mess up, that's it.

01:06:31.458 --> 01:06:32.292
Roger!

01:06:32.708 --> 01:06:34.375
All landing ships, depart!

01:06:35.042 --> 01:06:39.083
Starting from Godzilla's position,
create a path until the signal is given.

01:06:39.958 --> 01:06:41.667
Fire at will, if you must.

01:06:41.792 --> 01:06:44.250
Eliminate any obstacles in its way.

01:06:45.625 --> 01:06:47.292
Commencing final diversion.

01:06:47.875 --> 01:06:51.083
This is the point of no return.
We'll end this, now.

01:06:52.125 --> 01:06:56.375
Listen up, the landing ships' mobility
can't evade an attack in time.

01:06:56.458 --> 01:06:59.167
Once you know you're targeted,
abandon ship!

01:06:59.458 --> 01:07:01.250
Captain, you're being lavish!

01:07:01.875 --> 01:07:05.708
Hover squads, save ammo until
the route is open. Minimize losses.

01:07:06.167 --> 01:07:09.833
Roger. We're almost out of gas.
So there's no second chances!

01:07:11.958 --> 01:07:12.792
Turn!

01:07:20.542 --> 01:07:22.583
The landing ships are almost here!

01:07:22.667 --> 01:07:25.000
Spread out to avoid the bombardment!

01:07:27.375 --> 01:07:31.333
All ships, drop the thermobaric bombs!
Scatter all that you have!

01:07:41.792 --> 01:07:44.417
All landing ships, disperse! Spread out!

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.875
So who drew the short straw?

01:07:53.333 --> 01:07:54.250
It's me, huh?

01:08:09.708 --> 01:08:12.125
Okay! Godzilla is on the diversion path!

01:08:12.375 --> 01:08:16.082
Now! All hover squads,
fire everything you have! This is it!

01:08:16.332 --> 01:08:20.292
Roger! All squads, resume the diversion!
Increase attack frequency!

01:08:26.707 --> 01:08:27.542
Damn it!

01:08:29.332 --> 01:08:31.457
It's no good! I can't speed up!

01:08:34.792 --> 01:08:37.667
All squads! Join the left wing!
Just a little more!

01:08:40.082 --> 01:08:41.500
<i>Diversion is in progress.</i>

01:08:41.582 --> 01:08:44.500
<i>Godzilla is accelerating
toward the trap point!</i>

01:08:44.582 --> 01:08:46.457
<i>Haruo, please hurry and board.</i>

01:08:46.542 --> 01:08:47.417
Yuko!

01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:48.542
<i>Why are you here?</i>

01:08:49.082 --> 01:08:51.375
I've always been on the power suit team.

01:08:51.457 --> 01:08:54.667
<i>Do you understand?
This is practically a suicide mission!</i>

01:08:55.207 --> 01:08:56.792
I want to become stronger!

01:08:58.167 --> 01:09:00.957
That's what I thought when Grandpa died.

01:09:02.042 --> 01:09:05.792
<i>Godzilla entering Tanzawa Pass.
Only 500 meters to the trap point.</i>

01:09:19.457 --> 01:09:21.792
Damn it, I'm running out of gas!

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.957
Keep provoking it
and lure it to the last point.

01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:28.292
Stay calm, this is the critical moment.

01:09:28.582 --> 01:09:30.707
<i>Trap point arrival, 100 meters!</i>

01:09:34.417 --> 01:09:37.667
You will return Earth to humans.

01:09:38.542 --> 01:09:39.957
Fifty more meters!

01:09:40.832 --> 01:09:43.125
Damn, I can't stand this.

01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:47.792
At times like this, I'm jealous of those
who have a god to pray to.

01:09:55.333 --> 01:09:56.500
All units, disperse!

01:09:58.625 --> 01:09:59.625
<i>Ten meters!</i>

01:10:03.083 --> 01:10:04.792
<i>Godzilla is at the trap point!</i>

01:10:05.708 --> 01:10:06.792
Set off the trap!

01:10:16.250 --> 01:10:17.625
<i>Trap detonation complete!</i>

01:10:22.125 --> 01:10:24.792
Godzilla's movement stopped.

01:10:25.917 --> 01:10:27.792
Did we succeed in capturing it?

01:10:35.125 --> 01:10:37.958
Artillery unit, begin concentrated fire!

01:10:49.250 --> 01:10:51.333
Asymmetrically permeable shield,
generated!

01:10:51.750 --> 01:10:53.417
All gun ports, synchronized attack!

01:10:53.875 --> 01:10:56.625
Body surface electromagnetic pulse
alignment sync at 75%!

01:10:57.125 --> 01:10:59.833
At 75%? Is the pattern changing?

01:11:00.250 --> 01:11:03.708
Alignment incomplete.
Unable to predict shield collapse!

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.583
Damn it, we can't attack like this.

01:11:06.917 --> 01:11:08.625
Search for the noise. Hurry!

01:11:08.958 --> 01:11:12.875
Noise detected.
The next shield collapse is in 20 seconds.

01:11:13.375 --> 01:11:14.333
Twenty seconds?

01:11:14.708 --> 01:11:16.125
Will the restraints hold?

01:11:23.167 --> 01:11:24.167
Sync at 100%.

01:11:24.625 --> 01:11:28.542
Detecting resonance with noise wave!
Shield collapse in ten seconds!

01:11:35.792 --> 01:11:37.875
Artillery unit, fire!

01:11:41.250 --> 01:11:43.292
If we can destroy the dorsal fin...

01:11:45.083 --> 01:11:46.708
The shield is dropping!

01:11:47.292 --> 01:11:49.458
Electric potential rising!
It's an atomic breath!

01:11:51.958 --> 01:11:53.083
It can still attack?

01:11:54.792 --> 01:11:57.625
The tissue on Godzilla's back
is regenerating!

01:11:57.958 --> 01:11:59.875
The shield will be restored.

01:12:00.375 --> 01:12:02.667
Shield will be up in about 200 seconds!

01:12:02.958 --> 01:12:05.208
The restraints are no longer holding!

01:12:06.083 --> 01:12:06.917
Damn it.

01:12:07.667 --> 01:12:08.667
I'll finish this!

01:12:10.333 --> 01:12:11.458
Haruo!

01:12:17.167 --> 01:12:20.125
- What is he...
- With a close-range EMP attack,

01:12:20.208 --> 01:12:22.250
he'll disrupt the noise pattern.

01:12:26.583 --> 01:12:29.167
The pulse is changing. It's syncing again!

01:12:29.875 --> 01:12:32.333
The next shield collapse
is in ten seconds!

01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:35.792
Don't worry about me!
Destroy the rest of the dorsal fin!

01:12:36.083 --> 01:12:37.208
But then you'll...

01:12:37.750 --> 01:12:39.500
<i>Doesn't matter! Fire!</i>

01:12:40.292 --> 01:12:42.125
The shield is now collapsing!

01:12:44.875 --> 01:12:47.208
Fire! Fire until the gun barrel burns up!

01:12:51.667 --> 01:12:53.250
The shield is dropping!

01:12:53.625 --> 01:12:55.417
Okay, power suit unit, attack!

01:13:10.125 --> 01:13:12.375
The EMP probes are entering its body!

01:13:18.750 --> 01:13:21.708
All units, retreat! Retreat!

01:13:32.625 --> 01:13:34.958
Electromagnetic concentration
in the air, rising!

01:13:36.417 --> 01:13:38.292
It didn't work?

01:13:38.708 --> 01:13:42.417
It did, the electromagnetic waves
are running wild inside it.

01:13:53.167 --> 01:13:54.833
You bastard, I have...

01:13:57.458 --> 01:13:59.750
killed you!

01:14:15.667 --> 01:14:17.958
He really did it.

01:15:17.083 --> 01:15:17.917
Haruo!

01:15:31.917 --> 01:15:34.000
Look at this.

01:15:36.708 --> 01:15:38.208
This body structure...

01:15:39.750 --> 01:15:42.333
Yeah. Indeed a monster.

01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:46.542
You've accomplished it, Captain.

01:15:47.250 --> 01:15:50.250
Because everyone believed in
and supported me,

01:15:50.500 --> 01:15:52.750
I could be so daring and get this far.

01:15:53.917 --> 01:15:58.792
Even though we defeated it...
What was it, really?

01:15:59.375 --> 01:16:02.042
How was it able to live for 20,000 years?

01:16:03.625 --> 01:16:05.042
This is just my opinion,

01:16:05.583 --> 01:16:10.208
but I think this is a different Godzilla
than the one that drove us from Earth.

01:16:11.375 --> 01:16:15.625
But its appearance and abilities
were almost identical.

01:16:15.708 --> 01:16:19.375
And that's exactly why.
Life's true nature is found in change.

01:16:19.875 --> 01:16:23.083
No matter how gradual
the renewal cycle may be,

01:16:23.375 --> 01:16:26.792
it's impossible to maintain
the exact same appearance.

01:16:27.292 --> 01:16:31.750
So this one may be an offspring
that inherited Godzilla's form and nature.

01:16:31.958 --> 01:16:34.875
Such a guess would actually
be the most natural.

01:16:35.500 --> 01:16:40.167
Although the question remains
of why there was only this one. Also...

01:16:40.250 --> 01:16:44.375
So, there's no guarantee
only one of them survived.

01:16:44.833 --> 01:16:48.833
I apologize if what I'm saying
spoils the victory, but that is correct.

01:16:49.708 --> 01:16:54.792
That's fine. Thanks to this battle,
we proved that we can defeat Godzilla.

01:16:55.375 --> 01:16:58.708
Even if another one shows up,
we have nothing to fear.

01:16:59.667 --> 01:17:04.208
Since we've established a valid strategy,
we can be more effective next time.

01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:09.083
Personally, I would never want to cross
a tightrope like that ever again, though.

01:17:12.250 --> 01:17:13.083
What was that?

01:17:14.125 --> 01:17:16.125
Did anyone measure the vibration?

01:17:16.208 --> 01:17:18.167
I'm picking it up on this sensor!

01:17:19.750 --> 01:17:22.042
Find the origin using Gematoria analysis.

01:17:22.125 --> 01:17:22.958
Yes, sir.

01:17:23.583 --> 01:17:27.500
No, it can't be. Is the meter damaged?

01:17:27.750 --> 01:17:30.458
- What is it?
- It's within two kilometers?

01:17:30.542 --> 01:17:31.583
It's nearby!

01:17:31.708 --> 01:17:32.833
That's ridiculous!

01:17:32.917 --> 01:17:35.875
Electric potential, rising.
The numbers are unbelievable!

01:17:35.958 --> 01:17:38.125
They are far greater than Godzilla's!

01:17:38.208 --> 01:17:39.750
Underground heat source...

01:17:39.958 --> 01:17:43.042
Wait, a plasma reaction? This can't be!

01:18:16.208 --> 01:18:17.375
What's happening?

01:18:31.958 --> 01:18:32.792
Is that...

01:18:38.708 --> 01:18:39.708
Wh-What is that?

01:18:40.250 --> 01:18:41.083
Godzilla?

01:18:41.333 --> 01:18:43.833
Height over 300 meters and rising.

01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:48.375
Surface vibroscope estimates a mass
of about 100,000 tons.

01:18:50.958 --> 01:18:52.958
This is impossible!

01:19:09.750 --> 01:19:12.750
Can that be a living creature?
Unbelievable!

01:19:13.167 --> 01:19:17.417
No, according to the rules
for living creatures, this is correct.

01:19:18.042 --> 01:19:18.875
Professor?

01:19:18.958 --> 01:19:23.958
Indeed, the changing form of life
isn't just about decay.

01:19:24.917 --> 01:19:31.000
If it continued its life activity
for 20,000 years, growing earnestly...

01:19:32.375 --> 01:19:35.042
When those fleeting lives destined to die,

01:19:35.125 --> 01:19:38.042
forget their humbleness
and sing praises of their glory,

01:19:38.458 --> 01:19:41.625
such will shake the very heavens
and split the earth,

01:19:41.708 --> 01:19:44.167
and they shall know the wrath
of the divine.

01:19:44.250 --> 01:19:46.833
The inevitable incarnation of destruction.

01:19:50.250 --> 01:19:52.042
So, you show yourself at last.

01:19:52.625 --> 01:19:57.250
Since we last saw each other, it has been
20 years for us and 20,000 years for you.

01:19:59.542 --> 01:20:00.958
It's been a while...

01:20:02.125 --> 01:20:03.667
Oh, King of Destruction.

01:20:12.333 --> 01:20:15.750
All landing ships, take off immediately!
Emergency retreat!

01:20:16.083 --> 01:20:17.792
But we're still withdrawing!

01:20:17.875 --> 01:20:21.625
Just take whoever's already onboard
before that thing attacks us!

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:27.667
Everyone, do whatever it takes
to get far away from here! Hurry!

01:21:07.667 --> 01:21:10.042
What's that? A super oscillatory wave?

01:21:10.125 --> 01:21:14.375
Estimated electric output
is measuring over 900 gigawatts.

01:21:14.750 --> 01:21:15.583
Damn it!

01:21:16.208 --> 01:21:17.667
What do you intend to do?

01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:20.042
I'll divert its attention!

01:21:20.208 --> 01:21:22.292
I'll buy time so people can run!

01:21:22.375 --> 01:21:24.583
You don't think that'll work, do you?

01:22:35.208 --> 01:22:39.833
You bastard... I will...
