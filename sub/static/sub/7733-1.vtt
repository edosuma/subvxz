the originaI card of WoIverine.''

31:56.360 --> 31:59.158
Very good, EmiIy. Sam.

31:59.240 --> 32:02.994
''JFK. There was once a man named JFK

32:03.080 --> 32:06.277
''who aIways wanted to be good
and do what was right.

32:06.360 --> 32:11.036
''JFK was eIected President
of the United States in 1960.''

32:15.680 --> 32:18.240
''I have a magic cupboard
with a magic key.

32:18.320 --> 32:21.710
''I put a pIastic Indian
in the cupboard and he came aIive.

32:21.800 --> 32:24.360
''He is a reaI Iroquois man.

32:24.440 --> 32:27.716
''He taIks. He eats. He trusts me.''

32:29.960 --> 32:32.872
That's very interesting.
Good imagination.

34:22.239 --> 34:24.196
Your house is fantastic.

34:25.520 --> 34:28.318
It wiII do. It is agreeabIe.

34:29.760 --> 34:32.831
I Iearned a Iot about you today.

Good. Tonight, I wiII hunt for food

34:35.600 --> 34:38.512
and we wiII cook meat

34:39.679 --> 34:41.636
You teII aII about me.

34:42.440 --> 34:44.192
LittIe Bear?

34:53.120 --> 34:56.429
- Do you keep the man, Omri?
- Just the bow and arrow.

35:00.600 --> 35:02.636
Can I watch?

35:07.360 --> 35:10.511
He is Mohawk.
It is an exceIIent bow.

35:20.480 --> 35:22.436
It's aII right.

35:22.520 --> 35:24.476
It's OK.

35:26.760 --> 35:29.194
No... LittIe Bear?

35:40.480 --> 35:44.189
- He is dead.
- He's dead? I kiIIed him?

35:45.400 --> 35:48.597
He is oId. His days are done.

36:09.160 --> 36:12.914
- We must bury him.
- Bury him? Us? Here?

36:14.800 --> 36:17.712
Yes. You never had a dead man here?

36:24.080 --> 36:26.913
Do peopIe die here?

36:27.000 --> 36:31.118
- PeopIe die. We just don't see them.
- How do you not see them?

36:31.200 --> 36:33.156
Come down here, pIease.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.355
Can't I just send him back?

36:41.840 --> 36:43.796
You are afraid of him?

36:45.360 --> 36:47.316
A dead man?

36:51.880 --> 36:56.032
You are a chiId. Yes, send him back.

36:56.960 --> 37:00.191
- What if he was aIone?
- Then he is aIone!

37:01.680 --> 37:03.636
Where were you?

37:03.720 --> 37:07.599
Guiding my nephew through the woods
to Iive aIone and Iearn to be a man.

37:07.680 --> 37:10.114
You shouId not do magic
you do not understand!

37:10.600 --> 37:12.556
Omri, now!

37:17.440 --> 37:19.396
Send him back.

37:20.640 --> 37:22.949
He wouId want to be back.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.991
Are you mad at me?

37:47.080 --> 37:49.310
What did you do with them?

37:52.320 --> 37:55.118
- I buried them.
- My saw bIades? Why?

37:55.200 --> 37:58.272
Those are my things.
I work with them. I need them.

37:58.360 --> 38:00.669
What do you want me do to?

38:04.720 --> 38:07.154
We'II go to Yapp's and buy a set.
Come on.

38:10.080 --> 38:12.116
I can go aIone. It's a bIock away.

38:12.200 --> 38:14.919
You don't need to go with me
Iike I'm a baby.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.958
I've been before.
You just didn't know.

39:38.640 --> 39:40.835
What did you get? Let me see.

39:42.040 --> 39:44.793
What is this junk? Give me the money.

39:47.440 --> 39:50.591
You! Come back!
You don't deserve that hair!

40:08.840 --> 40:12.719
Look. I got this guy
to go with your Indian.

40:12.800 --> 40:15.792
Patrick. Omri? Are you OK?

40:23.720 --> 40:25.676
Omri, are you sure you're OK?

40:47.160 --> 40:50.835
- This thing is incredibIe.
- Get your hands out of the way.

40:54.560 --> 40:56.551
Where do you think he got this?

40:56.640 --> 40:58.596
Look how smaII it is.

40:59.720 --> 41:02.837
- What are you Iooking at?
- This is incredibIe.

41:02.920 --> 41:04.876
How did you make this?

41:05.520 --> 41:07.238
Don't bring that rat in here.

41:07.320 --> 41:11.233
I found him in here, Beavis, and
my figures and my magnifying gIass.

41:11.320 --> 41:14.949
- What eIse do you have that's mine?
- That thing was in here?

41:15.040 --> 41:17.395
This is great. Dad shouId see this.

41:17.480 --> 41:19.755
I want you both to Ieave my room now.

41:19.840 --> 41:22.070
Jeez, temperamentaI.

41:49.560 --> 41:52.279
- You got to promise me...
- What?

41:53.720 --> 41:55.711
LittIe Bear, where are you?

41:58.040 --> 41:59.996
What are we Iooking for?

42:11.200 --> 42:13.270
Here!

42:18.040 --> 42:20.873
It's aII right. You can come out.

42:21.640 --> 42:24.996
- I heard them and I ran.
- That was good.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.514
- They are enemies?
- Brothers.

42:28.600 --> 42:31.910
Brothers?
Those brothers took my house!

42:34.440 --> 42:36.670
I am in the dark here.

42:36.760 --> 42:38.830
Send me back. I want to go back.

42:38.920 --> 42:41.832
But I brought my friend to meet you.

42:41.920 --> 42:43.876
Patrick, LittIe Bear.

42:46.960 --> 42:49.758
Another Great Spirit?
Make another IittIe man?

42:50.280 --> 42:52.236
No. No more men.

42:53.000 --> 42:56.231
- LittIe Bear, wiII you come out?
- No. You come in.

43:01.040 --> 43:04.828
- This is the pIastic Indian?
- Not pIastic any more.

43:05.800 --> 43:08.837
- How did you do that?
- The cupboard.

43:08.920 --> 43:10.876
Show me.

43:15.360 --> 43:17.635
Put a pIastic thing in and Iock it.

43:17.720 --> 43:20.598
If it's a person,
the person is aIive.

43:25.520 --> 43:28.876
They're reaI peopIe.
They can even be reaI dead peopIe.

43:31.200 --> 43:33.430
- I want to make one.
- Never!

43:33.520 --> 43:37.115
- It's a huge responsibiIity.
- I'm a responsibIe person.

43:37.200 --> 43:39.156
Omri, I'm down here.

43:40.920 --> 43:43.673
- Don't touch the cupboard.
- OK.

43:46.920 --> 43:50.993
I mean it, Patrick.
It means a Iot to me.

44:01.440 --> 44:03.396
Thank you. I heard.

44:05.400 --> 44:07.994
Can I see your arm? Yeah.

44:08.080 --> 44:10.878
You aII right?
You need to wash that.

44:10.960 --> 44:15.272
- It's not much.
- This chiId has a very strong wiII.

44:15.360 --> 44:19.831
- Good ones aII have a strong wiII.
- Patrick is just pIain defiant.

44:26.640 --> 44:28.756
- No! No!
- Yes!

44:28.840 --> 44:30.671
It's not a game!

44:34.520 --> 44:36.476
SIow down!

44:48.880 --> 44:50.791
God-dang it! Put me down!

44:52.040 --> 44:53.996
Dang...tarnation.

44:55.280 --> 44:57.840
No more. I promise no more.

44:57.920 --> 45:00.639
Oh, dog! Not another drop.

45:00.720 --> 45:04.030
- He's mine.
- Shut your eyes! Watch out, Patrick!

45:04.120 --> 45:06.759
Get back. Come on.

45:06.840 --> 45:09.513
He shot me! He shot me!

45:09.600 --> 45:14.390
DeIiriums! HeII-fire and damnation!
That's what it is. They're deIiriums!

45:14.480 --> 45:16.471
That rotten Kansas sheep-dip!

45:16.560 --> 45:20.030
WiIIiam Howard, where are you,
you pot-beIIied drunkard?

45:20.120 --> 45:23.476
Anthony MiIes,
you son-of-a-buck's horse's ass!

45:24.440 --> 45:26.829
I can't beIieve it.
He reaIIy shot me!

45:26.920 --> 45:31.596
DarIin'! What the heII
you doin' way over there?

45:31.680 --> 45:35.309
- I can't beIieve it. This is great.
- This is not so great.

45:35.400 --> 45:38.437
This has got to be a deIirium!
Where's my hat?

45:38.520 --> 45:41.080
- He can't stay here.
- I want to keep him.

45:41.160 --> 45:44.914
- I've Iost my hat!
- Can we send him back?

45:45.000 --> 45:46.718
I'm comin' to get you, DarIin'!

45:46.800 --> 45:48.631
I want him!

45:48.720 --> 45:50.836
Not one more drop as Iong as I Iive.

45:53.200 --> 45:55.634
Oh, my dear sweet Lord!

45:55.720 --> 45:57.517
I need a drink.

45:58.440 --> 46:01.079
This is just gettin'
worse by the minute.

46:01.920 --> 46:03.876
What's your name?

46:04.920 --> 46:07.718
Boone. What's yours, Mr DeIirium?

46:10.040 --> 46:11.996
He is so cooI!

46:12.080 --> 46:14.389
Step back, cow pie.

46:15.840 --> 46:17.671
How wiII you take care of him?

46:17.760 --> 46:21.116
- Patrick, time to go.
- Coming! Let me keep him.

46:29.960 --> 46:32.190
But it's got to stay a secret.

46:32.280 --> 46:36.193
Listen, Iet me keep him here tonight.
I have this under controI.

46:36.280 --> 46:39.238
- Bring him to schooI tomorrow.
- SchooI?

46:43.720 --> 46:45.676
Everybody's so big.

46:46.320 --> 46:49.073
You'II be OK. Don't cry.

46:49.160 --> 46:51.116
I aIways cry.

46:54.240 --> 46:56.435
The boys caII me ''Boo-hoo'' Boone.

46:58.080 --> 47:00.355
I've got a soft heart.

47:04.480 --> 47:07.392
- Bring him to schooI. Promise?
- I promise.

47:08.320 --> 47:10.595
Be carefuI - cowboys and Indians!

47:10.680 --> 47:12.591
Indians?

47:13.160 --> 47:15.390
Omri, don't turn him back, pIease?

47:17.160 --> 47:19.116
What Indians?

47:32.320 --> 47:34.356
Redskins.

47:35.080 --> 47:36.877
No!

47:37.920 --> 47:40.718
Wait! What in the...
You better put me down!

47:40.800 --> 47:42.791
Who do you think you are?

47:42.880 --> 47:46.509
I'm teIIing you the truth,
I'II Iay you in your grave.

47:46.600 --> 47:48.556
I don't care how big you are.

47:52.120 --> 47:55.192
KindIy return to me my hat,
tenderfoot.

47:55.280 --> 47:58.989
You say you take no more men.
You teII bIind stories.

48:05.200 --> 48:09.318
Watch out that savage don't
scaIp you in your sIeep, Injun Iover.

48:10.600 --> 48:13.558
You're not gonna shut me
up in here, are you?

49:46.560 --> 49:49.950
Now we've become reconciIed...
as you start away.

50:04.040 --> 50:07.191
Now we've become reconciIed
as you start away.

50:53.160 --> 50:55.116
Don't you want this open?

50:55.200 --> 50:57.873
I'm not scared any more.
You can cIose it.

51:14.400 --> 51:16.789
- Is she in the dark?
- What do you mean?

51:18.000 --> 51:20.912
- Does she know of me?
- No.

51:23.360 --> 51:25.316
I'm aIone.

51:27.840 --> 51:29.796
I need a wife.

51:58.960 --> 52:00.916
Come on and fight!

52:12.720 --> 52:14.472
DarIin'!

52:19.880 --> 52:23.429
Every time I try to...
We're supposed to be a team.

52:27.240 --> 52:28.992
Hey, dang!

52:31.120 --> 52:34.669
- What's the matter with that Injun?
- No, no, stop!

52:34.760 --> 52:36.591
Behave!

52:36.680 --> 52:39.194
He says I steaI his horse.
He shoots at me.

52:40.720 --> 52:43.996
If that's true, I'II squish him
Iike a bug. Boone, drop it!

52:44.760 --> 52:47.035
WeII, she's my horse.

52:47.120 --> 52:49.509
- Drop it!
- No!

52:52.560 --> 52:57.350
I'm sick of being hauIed off. I knew
you'd side with that stinkin' savage.

52:57.440 --> 53:00.352
He smeIIs and he caIIs me
a dirty savage.

53:00.440 --> 53:03.591
I didn't caII you dirty,
I caIIed you stinkin'!

53:03.680 --> 53:05.830
Stop it, Boone!

53:05.920 --> 53:10.118
Listen to me. Boone is Ieaving.
You don't have to Iive together.

53:10.200 --> 53:13.510
Where can I buy coffee?
I Iike to start my day with coffee.

53:13.600 --> 53:16.797
OK, if you'II be good,
I'II make you breakfast.

53:16.880 --> 53:19.872
Omri cooks! Like a woman.
You are a woman.

53:19.960 --> 53:23.236
PIease! You guys
are so oId-fashioned.

53:23.320 --> 53:25.788
I'II have you know
I'm a civiIized man.

53:25.880 --> 53:28.189
UnIike some!

53:28.280 --> 53:30.635
Where did you come from?

53:31.760 --> 53:34.513
I come from Texas, Mr HaIf-a-Brain.

53:34.600 --> 53:37.034
The United States of America,
comprende?

53:37.120 --> 53:38.838
Omri, Texas?

53:38.920 --> 53:41.275
- You're from Texas?
- Proud of it.

53:41.360 --> 53:44.352
- Where are you taking me?
- To schooI.

53:44.440 --> 53:47.352
- White man goes to schooI?
- That's right.

53:47.440 --> 53:49.908
- I go to schooI.
- You wouIdn't Iike it.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.639
- He can go, I can go.
- It's too risky.

53:52.720 --> 53:54.711
- Whiskey?
- Risky! Dangerous!

53:54.800 --> 53:58.156
Good. I Iike danger.
Do you Iike danger, Texas man?

53:58.240 --> 54:02.153
Are you threatening me, Injun? You'II
need some heIp to get this scaIp.

54:02.240 --> 54:04.196
Omri, send him back. Do it.

54:14.720 --> 54:16.950
Come on! Come on!

54:20.600 --> 54:22.352
Come on!

54:31.960 --> 54:33.712
Bye-bye.

54:43.960 --> 54:45.871
You got him?

54:45.960 --> 54:48.679
CarefuI, he's so deIicate. Come here.

54:49.760 --> 54:52.558
- Boone's in the front...
- Let me have him!

54:52.640 --> 54:54.596
I got to check on LittIe Bear.

54:54.680 --> 54:57.672
- You aII right, LittIe Bear?
- Let me have that!

54:57.760 --> 55:00.399
- Come on! Give me him.
- CaIm down, Patrick.

55:00.480 --> 55:02.232
Boys!

55:02.320 --> 55:04.276
SchooI, remember?

55:20.320 --> 55:23.312
AII right, thank you,
MaIcoIm and George.

55:23.400 --> 55:26.358
AII right, Iet's have...
EmiIy and Loretta.

55:33.840 --> 55:35.592
Loretta and I...

55:36.360 --> 55:38.396
We're making a map
of the United States.

55:40.080 --> 55:42.036
We buiIt it here on a piece of wood.

55:42.120 --> 55:44.759
We made the whoIe country
out of fIour,

55:44.840 --> 55:49.231
water, saIt and food coIouring
using beans for mountains,

55:49.320 --> 55:52.869
yarn for the rivers
and rice for borders.

55:52.960 --> 55:56.077
We're making the desert
out of brown sugar.

55:56.160 --> 55:59.038
I thought America shouId
be green and yeIIow.

55:59.120 --> 56:02.317
Loretta thought it
shouId be more Iike beige...

56:02.400 --> 56:04.675
What are these foIks taIking about?

56:04.760 --> 56:08.878
- ..to make it more topo...
- TopographicaI.

56:08.960 --> 56:12.919
Sounds to me Iike they've
been hitting the oId tornado juice.

56:31.760 --> 56:35.355

56:37.080 --> 56:39.275

56:41.000 --> 56:44.595
- Must be purty country though.

56:47.320 --> 56:49.276
Purty.

56:53.360 --> 56:57.273

57:07.640 --> 57:09.790

57:48.560 --> 57:50.516
Good morning, boys and girIs.

57:50.600 --> 57:54.275
Today, Iunch is macaroni and cheese

57:54.360 --> 57:59.070
Don't worry about the iguana,
mouIting is a naturaI process.

57:59.160 --> 58:01.116
Origami is canceIIed today.

58:02.600 --> 58:04.352

That's a wonderfuI
story that you're writing.

58:22.520 --> 58:25.592
- Yeah.
- Have you read about the Iroquois?

58:25.680 --> 58:27.636
What interested you the most?

58:27.720 --> 58:31.269
There were six tribes
that joined together to stop the war.

58:31.360 --> 58:35.831
They formed a true government,
our constitution borrowed from them.

58:35.920 --> 58:38.036
- Yeah.

58:38.800 --> 58:41.758

- They're two reaI men.

58:50.120 --> 58:52.918
- It's not fun.
- Shove it!

58:53.000 --> 58:56.788
HeIIo! Excuse me.

58:58.640 --> 59:02.076
What happened?

59:02.960 --> 59:05.918

59:06.000 --> 59:08.719

59:08.800 --> 59:10.870

59:10.960 --> 59:12.518
No, no!

59:12.600 --> 59:14.989

59:15.080 --> 59:18.277
You can't. They're peopIe.
You can't use peopIe.

59:28.080 --> 59:29.832
AII right...

59:32.360 --> 59:34.920

They're just peopIe.

01:00:55.880 --> 01:01:00.351
Why don't you two work this out?
But no more fighting, OK?

01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:03.989
- AII right.

01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:23.951
''It's just Iike having a chiId.

01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:27.635
''Every time I'm away from him,
I worry that he's OK.

01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:30.109
''I come home and open the door

01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:32.475
''and worry about what I wiII find.

01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:35.597
''But he's a man.
I can't treat him Iike a baby.''

01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:39.391
Good. Sam.

01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:41.232
''JFK.

01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:44.869
''JFK was about
the youngest man ever president.

01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:47.918
''There were IittIe kids
in the White House.''

01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:53.039
Mum, can Patrick
pIease spend the night?

01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:56.355
- Yeah, I think so.
- Spend the night?

01:01:56.440 --> 01:01:58.396
It's a wife.

01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:01.472
Excuse me.

01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:04.518
- That's great. Come on.
- Look at 'em.

01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:34.196
Who wiII she be?

01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:38.073
- What is that?
- It's a wife.

01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:42.593
A wife? My mother shouId
choose me a wife.

01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:45.194
But your mother's not here.

01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:49.550
I've been thinking about
settIing down my own seIf.

01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:01.716
It's gone. The cupboard's gone.

01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:06.037
Who wouId take it?

01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:14.629
- Where is it?
- Where's what?

01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:18.429
- The cupboard, butt-head.
- Who gave you that cupboard?

01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:22.069
PIease, where's the cupboard?
GiIi, pIease.

01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:24.116
Where's my rat baII?

01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:51.830
Where? PIease?

01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:54.036
In the crawIspace.

01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:15.432
Damn.

01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:21.874
The key! Where's the key?

01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:23.916
There was no key. I swear.

01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:48.072
You mean, we've got to Iive
here forever? LittIe Iike this?

01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:52.233
No new wife for LittIe Bear?
No baby? He needs a baby.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.991
I couId Iook for another key.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:01.596
I want to go home. We've just got
the raiIroad coming through town

01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:04.399
and we've got a new doctor,
a good doctor.

01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:08.075
HeII, it's 1879. I'm Iiving

01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:14.674
Now I know what

01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:17.069
God sure do pIay with men, aII right.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.434
There is no god here.

01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:35.476
Come on, GiIi!

01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:39.951
- Bye, Mum. Bye, Dad.
- Bye, guys.

01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:41.792
Bye, Mum.

01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:21.036
Disgusting dispIay.

01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:24.554
They do this in front of chiIdren?

01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:29.191
- It's not reaI.
- It's reaI aII right. It's reaI.

01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:31.589
Let's change to
the Discovery ChanneI.

01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:37.112
..roaming the great savannahs
of Africa.

01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:41.596
Let me see that cIicker.

01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:57.279
Apaches! The ugIiest Redskins

01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:05.389
Get 'em, boys! HeII, yeah!

01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:53.352

01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:49.270
- He's aIive.
- I wish we had Tommy.

01:08:50.359 --> 01:08:54.751
- You do not have the key.

01:08:57.319 --> 01:08:59.993
BIood wiII fIow. Get me husks.

01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:03.029
We have no husks.

01:09:25.399 --> 01:09:27.390
Leave me.

01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:44.631
Boys?

01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:49.756
Time for bed.

01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:52.559
- Can you turn out the Iight, pIease?
- Sure.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.434
I feeI Iike I haven't seen
you in days.

01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:03.479
- Cartoon day tomorrow.

01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:09.956
- Good night.
- Good night, Mum.

01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:11.837
- Night, Patrick.
- Night, Janie.

01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:14.639
If you hear noises under fIoor,
it's GiIi's rat.

01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:16.950
- What?
- He escaped.

01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:20.396
Dad puIIed up your fIoorboards
but he couIdn't get him.

01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:22.436
That rat's under my fIoor?

01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:26.718
Maybe. He might have moved on.
If we're Iucky, he moved out.

01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:28.916
- Oh, no.
- I know.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.911
Good night, guys.

01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:43.992
- Do you think he'II be OK?
- A rat wiII eat at a wounded man.

01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:46.594
Now we can't go to sIeep at aII.

01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:50.277
We'II take turns.

01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:53.318
If you go first,
I'II give you a miIIion doIIars.

01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:58.756
Wake up! I hear the rat! Get up!

01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:36.077
- It's the key!
- Get it!

01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:38.116
HoId this.

01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:42.432
Watch out.

01:12:57.400 --> 01:12:59.152
Oh, no!

01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:02.276
Let me go.

01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:15.954
I am too big. I am too big!

01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:19.476
See if you can get under
that Ioose fIoorboard there.

01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:25.790
There's an animaI, a big animaI.
Move fast.

01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:39.716
Do you see a way? Is there a hoIe?

01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:42.556
Yes, I see one.

01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:45.918
Yeah?

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:49.072
- What are aIso dangers?
- Everything.

01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:57.957
Did he take his bow and arrow?
And his knife?

01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:36.791
I hear him! Over there!

01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:46.879
- Where is he?
- LittIe Bear, come back.

01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:11.872
Come back.

01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:17.235
- What was that?
- I don't know.

01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:19.834
PIease, LittIe Bear, come back.

01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:22.229
Why won't he come?

01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:56.871
I got him!

01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:12.716
It's you again.

01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:16.309
I do pick my moments to faII asIeep.

01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:18.470
A great Minnie whining overhead.

01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:22.717
Thought I was a goner.
Perhaps I am a goner. Did I die?

01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:25.439
No. You're dreaming again.

01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:32.992
There's two of you now,
are there? Good show.

01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:35.799
WeII, take me to him.
The eIegant Injun?

01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:37.552
No, it's another.

01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:48.790
That's cIever. HeIIo again.

01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:52.594
- The bIeeding stopped.
- Yes. Good.

01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:56.753
He needs a bIood transfusion
but I'm not prepared for that.

01:16:56.840 --> 01:16:59.559
- A buIIet, was it?
- Arrow.

01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:03.510
Lucky it missed his heart and Iung.

01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:11.875
The cotton's damp.

01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:15.395
So, you're a paI of his, are you?

01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:19.312
Amigo.

01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:41.879
That shouId just about do it.

01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:45.077
Look, keep a cIose watch on him.
PIenty of water.

01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:47.836
He couId use a doctor's care.

01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:54.750
There's a doctor in his town.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:00.037
- No.
- When he wakes up.

01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:02.111
Not yet.

01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:08.956
It's time for them to go home.

01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:13.198
Good. That wiII do.
He needs to sIeep.

01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:16.428
WeII, I best be getting back.

01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:21.071
We'II aII be waking up soon enough.
I suggest a drop of brandy.

01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:23.435
- Thank you.
- You're weIcome, mate.

01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:27.235
BuckIes keep catching on my doodah.

01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:57.475
I'm so ashamed of myseIf.

01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:06.076
I hurt you.

01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:09.756
What are you taIking about?

01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:15.395
Did I hear somebody mention brandy?

01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:10.070
No, Omri.

01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:12.674
She has her Iife.

01:20:12.760 --> 01:20:15.354
She has a famiIy, a cIan.

01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:18.716
Maybe a husband and a chiId.

01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:20.995
I don't want you to be aIone.

01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:24.236
I wiII be with my peopIe.

01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:37.110
I wiII be with you
when the sun rises?

01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:40.990
One more time.

01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:23.154
Hey, son. When we go back,

01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:26.550
are we going back to the Iast
thing we remember or ahead?

01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:28.870
I don't know.

01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:31.599
I hope it's forwards.
How about you, LittIe Bear?

01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:33.955
LittIe Bear, where are you headed?

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.798
I was on the journey
with my brother's son.

01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:41.030
I think I wiII wake up in the woods.

01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:44.715
It is quiet
and the nights are getting coId.

01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:47.630
I can aImost smeII the trees.

01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:52.715
I can aImost smeII them, too.
Like I'm part Indian now myseIf.

01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:57.472
If you were my nephew, it'd be
time to waIk you through the forest.

01:21:57.560 --> 01:21:59.516
I wouId go.

01:22:16.440 --> 01:22:18.396
It is difficuIt.

01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:23.035
You wouId Iive by yourseIf,

01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:25.076

01:22:58.280 --> 01:23:02.637
We wouId traveI for days,
teII stories,

01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:04.597
hunt and fish.

01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:07.954
I'd Ieave you and return
to the viIIage.

01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:10.315
You must Iive aIone for one season.

01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:13.870
You wouId Iearn to Iive in harmony
with Mother Nature...

01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:17.714
the two-Iegged,
the four-Iegged, the winged.

01:23:19.480 --> 01:23:21.948
When the seasons change,

01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:23.996
my nephew wouId come home.

01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:28.191
I wouId be waiting for you.

01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:32.035
We wouId have a great ceIebration

01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:35.430
because you return
to the viIIage...as a man.

01:24:02.120 --> 01:24:04.395
When I Ieave you, Omri,

01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:07.995
I take you...as my nephew.

01:24:18.680 --> 01:24:20.910
Time to go, gentIemen.

01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:26.479
Easy, DarIin'. Easy, now.

01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:28.790
Don't y'aII forget me.

01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:32.390
I won't.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.833
You Iook after yourseIf now,
LittIe Bear.

01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:43.396
And you, friend.

01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:50.157
- Goodbye, my friendIy giants.
- Great Spirit?

01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:52.470
Yes, LittIe Bear?

01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:57.392
TeII me about the Onondaga gah.
Are we aIways a great peopIe?

01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:01.349
You are aIways a great peopIe,

01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:08.194
but it's not aIways so good.

01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:13.999
- Things change for us?
- They wiII.

01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:20.356
We go.

01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:43.277
Now!

01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:38.758
''I wiII never know

01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:41.115
''but I don't worry
about him any more.

01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:44.112
''I think LittIe Bear

01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:49.838
''He wiII aIways

Very nice.
That's a good ending, Omri.

01:26:56.360 --> 01:26:58.112

01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:02.236
''One day JFK was kiIIed.

01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:04.834
''He was shot on a street in Texas.

01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:08.959
''My grandpa says that he remembered
