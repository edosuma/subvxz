00:32.521 --> 00:34.455
Mitch?

00:34.457 --> 00:35.489
Mitch, run!

00:35.491 --> 00:37.358
It's gonna blow up!

00:37.360 --> 00:38.826
Run!

00:38.828 --> 00:41.730
Meet Ben Zagger Zagowski.

00:41.732 --> 00:44.865
This frightened
man-child has become

00:44.867 --> 00:49.770
the envy of Green Bay
super fans everywhere.

00:52.909 --> 00:54.975
Packer fans are
Packer fans for life.

00:54.977 --> 00:56.911
My whole life I've
been a Packers fan.

00:56.913 --> 00:58.612
My whole life.

00:58.614 --> 01:00.881
Fans of any team in the world

01:00.883 --> 01:03.518
have a thirst to
wear their colors

01:03.520 --> 01:07.724
bigger, better and
louder than any other.

01:07.726 --> 01:10.626
This hat has been
with me a long time.

01:10.628 --> 01:12.060
Until it completely falls apart,

01:12.062 --> 01:13.563
it's gonna be with
me at the games.

01:13.565 --> 01:15.597
It's just really
fun, and seeing him,

01:15.599 --> 01:19.135
like, scream at the
TV, it's hilarious.

01:19.137 --> 01:21.804
Expecting those closest to them

01:21.806 --> 01:27.043
to join in the journey or
suffer the consequences.

01:27.045 --> 01:29.645
I thank God I'm not
married to my ex-wife

01:29.647 --> 01:32.148
and I'm married to my
lovely current wife

01:32.150 --> 01:33.751
because of the Packers.

01:33.753 --> 01:34.852
There are game days
when I don't even

01:34.854 --> 01:36.653
want to be around her,

01:36.655 --> 01:38.989
because of how
out-of-bounds she gets

01:38.991 --> 01:41.392
with her passion for the team.

01:42.962 --> 01:46.597
Zagger's desire to
be a fan among fans

01:46.599 --> 01:51.836
propelled him to implement
his parking lot living room.

01:51.838 --> 01:54.639
This proximity allowed him to be

01:54.641 --> 01:57.642
as close to the
action as possible,

01:57.644 --> 01:59.911
proving his commitment.

01:59.913 --> 02:03.914
Zagger would always have
his teammates by his side.

02:03.916 --> 02:07.818
In attendance was his
only friend, Polano,

02:07.820 --> 02:11.956
a rare Bears fan living
behind enemy lines,

02:11.958 --> 02:14.827
as well as Zagger's
sister, Debbie,

02:14.829 --> 02:16.862
the smart one in the family.

02:16.864 --> 02:21.534
But most notably was his
fiancÃ©, Amy Etzman.

02:21.536 --> 02:24.636
Not her. Ah, there she is.

02:24.638 --> 02:28.940
When Zagger proposed to
her eight years ago,

02:28.942 --> 02:33.212
he forever brought her into
his world of super fan.

02:33.214 --> 02:35.513
Go Pack, Go!

02:35.515 --> 02:39.786
And she brought him into
her world of the employed,

02:39.788 --> 02:42.555
obtaining him a job in
the shipping department

02:42.557 --> 02:44.891
at the company where she worked.

02:44.893 --> 02:47.597
Polano, post route.

02:48.864 --> 02:50.630
I got it!

02:50.632 --> 02:53.834
The future looked
bright for Zagger,

02:53.836 --> 02:56.102
but the road for
Zagger to become

02:56.104 --> 02:59.238
this legendary symbol of fandom

02:59.240 --> 03:02.810
was wrought with great
sacrifice, struggle,

03:02.812 --> 03:04.978
and commitment.

03:13.156 --> 03:17.257
Okay, can I look now? It's
really hot back here.

03:17.259 --> 03:19.727
I know, the center of
my back is always hot.

03:19.729 --> 03:21.529
- Yeah.
- I have hot back.

03:21.531 --> 03:23.864
- Yeah, you do.
- Okay, keep your eyes closed.

03:23.866 --> 03:25.735
- Okay.
- Okay.

03:26.504 --> 03:27.639
All right.

03:28.806 --> 03:30.607
Oh, gosh.

03:33.177 --> 03:35.076
Okay, look.

03:35.078 --> 03:38.116
Oh, my gosh. We did it?

03:43.119 --> 03:44.686
You're not following the

03:44.688 --> 03:46.054
no-sexual-touching-in-the-office
policy.

03:46.056 --> 03:47.723
Remember that weird meeting

03:47.725 --> 03:49.791
after the Jablonski/Karen
incident?

03:49.793 --> 03:52.228
Karen, cut it out. You're gonna
send him back to therapy.

03:52.230 --> 03:55.831
- Holy balls, I love you.
- Holy balls, I love you.

03:55.833 --> 03:57.967
Holy balls, I'd rather
watch you make out.

03:57.969 --> 04:00.169
Polano, we did it. We
finally have enough

04:00.171 --> 04:01.638
money to get married.

04:01.640 --> 04:03.139
Aw, you two are getting married

04:03.141 --> 04:04.873
and Tracey and I are
getting a divorce.

04:04.875 --> 04:06.642
The world is balanced.

04:06.644 --> 04:08.577
My grandma sent us a
check for 350 bucks,

04:08.579 --> 04:09.979
and that puts us over the mark.

04:09.981 --> 04:11.547
Okay, so is it real this time

04:11.549 --> 04:13.248
or do you want me to
react the same way I did

04:13.250 --> 04:15.018
the past five times you told me?

04:15.020 --> 04:16.653
It's so for real that
I'll even let you

04:16.654 --> 04:18.822
- bang one of my bridesmaids.
- Oh.

04:18.824 --> 04:20.822
Once your divorce is final.

04:20.825 --> 04:24.027
Oh, thank you, Amy. Thank you.

04:24.029 --> 04:25.930
Oh, time. Time, time, time.

04:25.932 --> 04:28.332
- We gotta go. Let's go.
- Oh, I do have one question.

04:28.334 --> 04:30.601
How is it that the only
Bears fan in Green Bay

04:30.603 --> 04:33.337
wins tickets to a
closed Pack practice?

04:33.339 --> 04:35.039
- Karma.
- Mm-hm.

04:35.041 --> 04:37.775
- And phony raffle tickets.
- There you...

04:37.777 --> 04:40.845
I get it. The voice is
because I'm Italian.

04:40.847 --> 04:42.681
I'm only going because
you're my best friend,

04:42.683 --> 04:45.083
and I'm gonna email everything
I see to Lovie Smith.

04:45.085 --> 04:47.718
- Ooh!
- I love you, lover.

04:47.720 --> 04:48.955
I love you.

04:50.222 --> 04:53.691
Oh, babe? What about your work?

04:53.693 --> 04:56.961
Go Pack, go! Half day, bitches!

04:56.963 --> 04:58.798
Damn it, Karen!

05:01.702 --> 05:03.037
Two seconds.

05:05.939 --> 05:08.106
I know if it was my team, I'd
want to go straight there.

05:08.108 --> 05:10.009
I'm not going to a practice
without my stats binder.

05:10.011 --> 05:12.948
Oh, while you're in there,
try and find your testicles.

05:15.382 --> 05:19.050
Dad, make sure you don't
weld the wrong crack.

05:19.052 --> 05:21.252
What? There's only
one crack in this...

05:21.254 --> 05:24.255
Oh, you mean my butt crack.

05:24.257 --> 05:27.160
- Funny. Good one.
- Where's my stats binder?

05:27.162 --> 05:29.796
Hey, uh, so are you two excited?

05:29.798 --> 05:31.231
Oh yeah, of course.

05:31.233 --> 05:33.032
I mean Polano just wants
to get out of work.

05:33.034 --> 05:35.969
No, I am talking about you
and Amy and the wedding.

05:35.971 --> 05:38.304
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. We're,
she's, she's pumped about it.

05:38.306 --> 05:40.273
- Have you seen it?
- Did you agree on

05:40.275 --> 05:42.042
the, um, color scheme?

05:42.044 --> 05:45.011
Oh, how about the invites?
Did you get those yet?

05:45.013 --> 05:47.147
Or better yet, a save-the-date.

05:47.149 --> 05:50.718
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Ma. I know, okay?
But where is it?

05:50.720 --> 05:55.626
If I don't have the binder, it
will affect the whole season.

06:04.066 --> 06:06.000
You knew where it
was the whole time.

06:06.002 --> 06:08.735
Don't forget. You and
Amy work well together.

06:08.737 --> 06:10.672
You'll make a great team.

06:10.674 --> 06:12.706
Hey, I got a great idea for
your save-the-date card.

06:12.708 --> 06:14.308
Look, even your father's
serious about it.

06:14.310 --> 06:18.847
You could put an R after
the V, like Favre.

06:18.849 --> 06:21.849
Then people might think that
they should savor the date,

06:21.851 --> 06:23.318
but I like what you're thinking.

06:23.320 --> 06:25.119
Don't savor the date.

06:25.121 --> 06:27.121
Just save the date
like a normal person.

06:27.123 --> 06:30.058
I can't make any promises,
Ma, but I'll definitely try.

06:30.060 --> 06:31.193
- I gotta go, okay? I love you.
- Okay.

06:31.195 --> 06:32.794
- Please, please.
- Yeah.

06:32.796 --> 06:33.861
Just take this
seriously, Ben, please?

06:33.863 --> 06:35.731
- I will.
- Okay.

06:35.733 --> 06:37.701
- Go Pack, go!
- Go Pack, go!

06:37.703 --> 06:39.037
Go Pack, go.

06:41.806 --> 06:44.273
- Guess what?
- What?

06:44.275 --> 06:45.677
We set a date!

06:46.912 --> 06:48.711
Should I react the
same way I did

06:48.713 --> 06:50.713
the last five times or
something different?

06:50.715 --> 06:52.215
No, something different.

06:52.217 --> 06:54.817
Listen girl, I love my
brother like he was,

06:54.819 --> 06:57.287
well, my brother, but
you deserve someone

06:57.289 --> 06:59.321
who is considerate and who
has their shit together

06:59.323 --> 07:02.459
and who showers and puts
your needs above theirs.

07:02.461 --> 07:04.327
Hang on, I gotta take this.

07:04.329 --> 07:07.130
Amy, I'm sorry to be
the hard-ass new boss,

07:07.132 --> 07:09.733
it's just I need you to...

07:09.735 --> 07:11.904
Oh, you're on the phone.

07:21.848 --> 07:23.850
- Are you on hold?
- Yeah.

07:27.787 --> 07:29.487
No, you know what? I'm
gonna take care of it.

07:29.489 --> 07:31.189
It's not that big a deal.

07:31.191 --> 07:32.456
You have every right
to be on the phone.

07:32.458 --> 07:35.362
You have as much right as a man.

07:36.530 --> 07:37.963
Okay.

07:37.965 --> 07:39.765
To get in my Butkus.

07:39.767 --> 07:40.902
Oh, hey.

07:41.768 --> 07:43.434
What's so funny?

07:43.436 --> 07:46.938
Uh, one of our clients
got denied parole.

07:46.940 --> 07:48.907
- Oh.
- Anyway, what were

07:48.909 --> 07:51.810
we talking about? Um,
oh yeah, what a piece

07:51.812 --> 07:54.213
- of shit my brother is.
- He's not.

07:54.215 --> 07:56.882
He even said he had a little
surprise for me later.

07:56.884 --> 07:58.851
The only time my brother
surprises anyone

07:58.853 --> 08:02.053
is when he acts like an adult,
and I have yet to be surprised.

08:06.261 --> 08:09.995
You realize we're
watching practice, right?

08:09.997 --> 08:11.997
Dude, when third
string is running

08:11.999 --> 08:14.902
Gun Normal-Y-Flex-Tight
on first down scenarios,

08:14.904 --> 08:18.472
they are confident. The
depth chart is solid.

08:18.474 --> 08:21.340
I think they are big game
capable this season.

08:21.342 --> 08:23.075
Yeah, well, the
conference championship

08:23.077 --> 08:25.044
is running right
through Chicago,

08:25.046 --> 08:26.813
- obviously.
- No. No, no.

08:26.815 --> 08:29.183
I forecasted the Bears
to finish sub 500

08:29.185 --> 08:30.883
due to lack of run support.

08:30.885 --> 08:33.820
So, what's the surprise
for Amy tonight?

08:33.822 --> 08:36.022
Oh, I'm gonna put a deposit down

08:36.024 --> 08:39.460
at that really nice Bayfront
resort for the reception.

08:39.462 --> 08:41.229
- Nice.
- Right?

08:41.231 --> 08:42.496
Love the cheese curds there.

08:42.498 --> 08:45.401
Whoop, sorry. Whoops, my bad.

08:47.069 --> 08:49.903
Mark Tauscher, right tackle.

08:49.905 --> 08:53.374
The 224th pick of the seventh
round of the 2000 draft,

08:53.376 --> 08:56.211
born June 17th, 1977 in
Auburndale, Wisconsin.

08:56.213 --> 09:01.249
Wears a size 15 shoe, favorite
movie is Kindergarten Cop.

09:01.251 --> 09:06.922
Can you, uh, can you sign, can
you sign, sign this for me?

09:06.924 --> 09:10.359
75 man roster, hand-written.
Uh, yeah, sure.

09:10.361 --> 09:13.562
Can you make it out
to Miss Hot Back?

09:13.564 --> 09:17.899
- Miss Hot Back.
- That's my wife.

09:17.901 --> 09:18.936
FiancÃ©.

09:20.438 --> 09:22.270
- I'm sure you'll figure it out.
- Yeah.

09:22.272 --> 09:25.406
- We are figuring it out, and...
- Yeah, Bears.

09:25.408 --> 09:28.144
Uh, does anyone ever call
you The Tausch Mahal?

09:28.146 --> 09:31.548
- That's not funny.
- Uh, no.

09:31.550 --> 09:37.556
Yeah, he does open mics,
stand-up, so down, uh...

09:38.422 --> 09:39.289
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

09:39.291 --> 09:40.457
- Good.
- Good.

09:40.459 --> 09:43.126
All right, yes. So, uh, so yeah,

09:43.128 --> 09:45.160
keep stepping in the bucket.
Pullin', pullin' and crushin',

09:45.162 --> 09:47.030
active feet, elbows in.

09:47.032 --> 09:49.937
Sure. Will do. Take care.

09:52.672 --> 09:56.206
He's huge.

09:56.208 --> 09:58.342
I don't know what
his problem was.

09:58.344 --> 10:00.011
I thought Tausch Mahal was gold.

10:00.013 --> 10:03.550
Could this day get any better?

10:15.395 --> 10:17.195
Are you boys lost?

10:17.197 --> 10:19.498
Dumb? Or both?

10:19.500 --> 10:21.099
This house for sale?

10:21.101 --> 10:23.969
No, the house in China
directly under us,

10:23.971 --> 10:25.470
through the Earth.

10:25.472 --> 10:28.673
As in somebody could buy it

10:28.675 --> 10:32.646
and live in it, right next to...

10:34.682 --> 10:37.482
People don't give
up these houses.

10:37.484 --> 10:39.519
I got a few questions for ya.

10:39.521 --> 10:42.522
First, what's your
name, old-timer?

10:42.524 --> 10:46.125
- Rick Warner.
- Okay, that was an easy one.

10:46.127 --> 10:49.995
Second question,
what is your deal?

10:49.997 --> 10:52.432
I'm too old for this craziness.

10:52.434 --> 10:54.333
I'm moving to Florida.

10:54.335 --> 10:56.436
You boys interested
in the house or what?

10:56.438 --> 11:00.206
Ah, hey. I'll ask the
questions here, Rick.

11:00.208 --> 11:01.674
Final question, is it required

11:01.676 --> 11:04.077
for all old people
to move to Florida?

11:06.715 --> 11:07.715
Huddle.

11:09.285 --> 11:12.052
Think about it. No more
parking lot living room.

11:12.054 --> 11:14.288
We could have an
actual living room.

11:14.290 --> 11:17.223
It would be like the
40, the 50, The Sixty,

11:17.225 --> 11:19.693
The Sixty Yard Line,
that's what we'll call it.

11:19.695 --> 11:21.661
The Sixty Yard Line.

11:21.663 --> 11:23.230
Aren't your funds a little
tied up at the moment?

11:23.232 --> 11:26.601
No. Yes. Maybe.

11:26.603 --> 11:28.670
But this is perfect
for Amy and I.

11:28.672 --> 11:31.506
It's perfect for me. I can
get divorce-drunk here.

11:31.508 --> 11:33.775
I mean Amy likes the Pack.

11:33.777 --> 11:35.477
Yeah.

11:35.479 --> 11:41.152
But she also really wants
the wedding really bad.

11:43.019 --> 11:46.721
Yeah. Okay, ready? Break!

11:46.723 --> 11:48.790
Ugh, I'm sorry, but I
just, I can't do it...

11:48.792 --> 11:52.697
Hey, Rick! What's up, fellas?

11:54.731 --> 11:56.632
Wait to become a home-owner.

11:56.634 --> 11:59.035
- I'll take it.
- Ahman, man!

11:59.037 --> 12:01.670
You haven't said one word
about the practice today.

12:01.672 --> 12:04.672
- Did our offense look tight?
- Oh, yeah. It was real tight.

12:04.674 --> 12:07.642
It was like
jeans-out-of-the-dryer tight.

12:07.644 --> 12:11.613
They ran a lot of slot plays.
Green Right, Strong Slot two.

12:11.615 --> 12:14.283
Go left. Uh, Y Banana.

12:14.285 --> 12:17.153
It's fun to just say
slot and Y Banana,

12:17.155 --> 12:19.489
in the same sentence and
not make it sound dirty?

12:19.491 --> 12:22.826
Right. Right. Go
right, go right.

12:22.828 --> 12:24.494
- Oh, gosh.
- Right.

12:24.496 --> 12:26.495
I'm sorry, I got
confused with the plays.

12:26.497 --> 12:30.469
And I got you this.

12:32.371 --> 12:34.370
Oh, my gosh!

12:34.372 --> 12:36.773
- Wait, who?
- Tauscher.

12:36.775 --> 12:38.609
I love him, his hair.

12:38.611 --> 12:41.711
And while we were there,
Ahman Green rode right by,

12:41.713 --> 12:43.581
and guess what he said?

12:43.583 --> 12:46.650
He looked right at us, and he's
like, "What's up, fellas?"

12:46.652 --> 12:50.554
- Go right.
- What is this little surprise?

12:50.556 --> 12:52.756
- Close your eyes.
- I'm driving.

12:52.758 --> 12:55.428
- Perfect, do it anyways.
- No.

12:56.429 --> 12:57.562
Pull in here.

12:57.564 --> 12:59.699
Right here, this is it.

13:04.839 --> 13:07.172
Come on, come on.

13:07.174 --> 13:10.108
- What's going on?
- Just don't speak.

13:10.110 --> 13:11.610
I know just what
you're thinking.

13:11.612 --> 13:14.179
Don't give me the
No Doubt treatment.

13:14.181 --> 13:15.646
What's going on?

13:15.648 --> 13:17.551
Okay. Just wait.

13:20.320 --> 13:23.488
- How do you have a key?
- Shh.

13:23.490 --> 13:25.393
No talking.

13:26.695 --> 13:27.695
What?

13:32.366 --> 13:35.170
Oh, you're too, oh, sorry.

13:45.412 --> 13:47.483
First back here.

13:48.850 --> 13:53.255
Okay, so there's this, huh?

13:56.391 --> 13:58.461
Okay, now back inside.

14:00.362 --> 14:01.430
So...

14:03.298 --> 14:04.431
Right?

14:04.433 --> 14:07.167
Oh, oh, I can speak now?

14:07.169 --> 14:10.336
Oh, yeah. I mean I
just, I was thinking,

14:10.338 --> 14:11.872
I love you, and...

14:11.874 --> 14:13.741
So glad that you came
to that conclusion.

14:13.743 --> 14:17.278
And holy balls, I
want to marry you.

14:17.280 --> 14:18.913
- But...
- But?

14:18.915 --> 14:20.614
Just hold on.

14:20.616 --> 14:22.850
If we get married while we're
still in our apartment,

14:22.852 --> 14:26.555
are we really taking our
relationship to the next level,

14:26.557 --> 14:30.392
which is what we
both want, right?

14:30.394 --> 14:35.397
But if we buy a house together,

14:35.399 --> 14:38.303
that's huge.

14:38.869 --> 14:41.203
Ben.

14:41.205 --> 14:44.242
What did you do?

14:46.477 --> 14:49.412
Did you buy this house?

14:49.414 --> 14:51.216
Surprise!

14:53.617 --> 14:56.485
This is the little surprise
that you were talking about?

14:56.487 --> 14:57.753
No.

14:57.755 --> 14:59.521
- Yes.
- Ben!

14:59.523 --> 15:02.793
- Maybe?
- What? What?

15:02.795 --> 15:04.227
- Listen.
- What?

15:04.229 --> 15:06.395
I have it all planned out.

15:06.397 --> 15:08.799
This is a place for
our family, too.

15:08.801 --> 15:10.967
We can start a family.

15:10.969 --> 15:14.938
Right there is where our son
strong safety, Teddy Zagowski,

15:14.940 --> 15:16.807
will take his first steps.

15:16.809 --> 15:18.942
And then right there
is where our daughter,

15:18.944 --> 15:22.679
first female General
Manager, Juliette Zagowski,

15:22.681 --> 15:24.747
will learn to assess the draft.

15:24.749 --> 15:27.352
And right out back in
the yard is where...

15:27.354 --> 15:29.454
- Surprise!
- Oh, my gosh!

15:29.456 --> 15:31.421
My god, dude! Come on!

15:31.423 --> 15:33.358
- Congratulations!
- Geez!

15:33.360 --> 15:35.359
Geez, I almost...

15:35.361 --> 15:37.262
- What are you doing here?
- I woulda blocked it.

15:37.264 --> 15:39.664
Ah, I just wanted to be
here for the big moment.

15:39.666 --> 15:41.799
Plus, Tracey keeps
going by my apartment

15:41.801 --> 15:43.700
asking about her red sweater,

15:43.702 --> 15:47.807
which I don't have because I
burned it in a fit of rage.

15:51.578 --> 15:52.613
Welp...

15:55.750 --> 16:00.286
I'll leave you two
lovebirds to the new nest.

16:00.288 --> 16:01.856
Norwegian corner.

16:04.958 --> 16:07.759
So, what do you think?

16:07.761 --> 16:11.830
Please tell me that you robbed
a bank or won the lottery.

16:11.832 --> 16:13.299
Oh, we're still gonna
have a wedding.

16:13.301 --> 16:14.466
We're gonna have a wedding.

16:14.468 --> 16:15.935
Don't, don't worry about that.

16:15.937 --> 16:17.836
I'll start saving again,
and, and besides,

16:17.838 --> 16:20.340
we can use the house
for the wedding.

16:20.342 --> 16:24.043
We could put the, the,
um, the Tabernacle,

16:24.045 --> 16:27.480
chuppah thing on the back deck,

16:27.482 --> 16:30.049
and the house is
a wedding venue.

16:30.051 --> 16:33.622
- It's called an altar.
- Altar! That's it.

16:36.525 --> 16:38.525
I guess the house
is kind of cute.

16:38.527 --> 16:39.527
Yes!

16:49.738 --> 16:51.938
Don't tell Tracey
about the sweater.

16:56.646 --> 16:58.048
Perfect.

16:58.815 --> 17:00.017
All right.

17:05.756 --> 17:06.854
Brown drops back,

17:06.856 --> 17:08.089
gets going down the left

17:08.092 --> 17:09.757
side line for eight yards.

17:09.759 --> 17:12.127
Nick Shommer makes the
stop for Tennessee,

17:12.128 --> 17:14.563
and the Packers are starting
to see a little light

17:14.565 --> 17:17.835
for this offense in
the second half.

17:23.106 --> 17:26.375
This is not where I
imagined getting drunk.

17:26.377 --> 17:27.876
Tiny TV, scented candles.

17:27.877 --> 17:31.147
There are birds
everywhere in this place.

17:31.149 --> 17:32.914
Amy says it fits our age.

17:32.916 --> 17:35.985
- And where's your chair?
- Around.

17:35.987 --> 17:37.853
This place looks like
Pier One Imports

17:37.855 --> 17:40.358
took a pure deuce export.

17:42.826 --> 17:45.961
- And what does that mean?
- She loves it.

17:45.963 --> 17:49.031
But do you Live, Laugh, Love it?

17:49.033 --> 17:52.402
You know, it's words.

17:52.404 --> 17:56.006
Oh, my God. Dude, this
is your house, too.

17:56.008 --> 17:58.075
Where is the pride for
those green and gold wimps

17:58.077 --> 17:59.742
you call The Pack?

17:59.744 --> 18:01.044
Oh, you mean the
12 time champions?

18:01.046 --> 18:02.645
- Yeah.
- That just scored.

18:02.647 --> 18:04.114
That kid is sick.

18:04.116 --> 18:05.681
I don't know how you
see that in that TV.

18:05.683 --> 18:08.117
They're... It's
fine, I can see it.

18:08.119 --> 18:09.886
What are you, this
is pre-season.

18:09.888 --> 18:12.588
- Hey, love.
- My dad gave us some venison.

18:12.590 --> 18:15.626
- You bums want any or no?
- Yes.

18:15.628 --> 18:17.461
- Yes.
- With a side

18:17.463 --> 18:19.963
of Verbena Lemongrass
candles, please Amy, thanks.

18:19.965 --> 18:21.932
- How'd you know that scent?
- How did you know that scent?

18:21.934 --> 18:23.768
That is not important right now.

18:23.770 --> 18:26.136
What happened to the idea
of The Sixty Yard Line?

18:26.138 --> 18:29.106
You own a house next
to Lambeau Field,

18:29.108 --> 18:31.542
and there is no
football stuff in here.

18:31.544 --> 18:33.978
Where is the football?

18:33.980 --> 18:36.847
I suppose we could get a
couple of football things.

18:36.849 --> 18:38.719
Are you serious?

18:39.787 --> 18:41.720
You'd be cool with that?

18:41.722 --> 18:43.122
- Sure.
- Yes, awesome.

18:43.124 --> 18:45.491
- Navy blue and orange.
- Green and gold!

18:45.493 --> 18:47.963
- Don't be dumb.
- Promise me less pillows.

18:52.966 --> 18:55.067
I realize I've only been

18:55.069 --> 18:57.536
regional manager here
for about a week,

18:57.538 --> 18:59.838
but, uh, you've
already stood out

18:59.840 --> 19:01.875
as a valuable asset
to this company.

19:01.877 --> 19:05.479
- Oh.
- You're very professional.

19:05.481 --> 19:07.079
You're well-respected.

19:07.081 --> 19:10.884
I guess you haven't
seen my arrest record.

19:10.886 --> 19:12.021
I don't...

19:14.590 --> 19:16.792
A sense of humor to boot.

19:18.694 --> 19:21.895
I think many of our employees
could learn a lot from you.

19:21.897 --> 19:24.530
Polano, hit me! I'm wide!

19:24.532 --> 19:28.472
Oh! Gosh, what an
interesting read.

19:31.841 --> 19:35.675
It's an interesting
write, actually.

19:35.677 --> 19:37.211
- No.
- Yeah.

19:37.213 --> 19:40.047
- You wrote that?
- Yeah.

19:40.049 --> 19:41.715
Yeah, I teach a weekend course

19:41.717 --> 19:45.520
on women's study at
Saint Norbert's.

19:45.522 --> 19:48.924
Oh. It's like a
hobby of yours or?

19:48.926 --> 19:52.261
I mean, you know,
macramÃ© is a hobby.

19:52.263 --> 19:55.030
Model trains, that's a hobby.

19:55.032 --> 19:59.834
Vegetarianism, hobby. But,
recognizing the struggle

19:59.836 --> 20:03.938
of your historically
oppressed gender,

20:03.940 --> 20:05.909
that's a way of life.

20:11.982 --> 20:14.684
I always wanted to scuba dive.

20:14.686 --> 20:16.755
What's stopping you?

20:18.957 --> 20:22.190
Dude, hit the hands.

20:22.192 --> 20:23.927
You missed my open mic
on Tuesday night.

20:23.929 --> 20:25.861
- Damn.
- The other two comics,

20:25.863 --> 20:27.897
- like, laughed a few times.
- My bad, I'm sorry.

20:27.899 --> 20:29.831
I'll make it to one
eventually, I promise.

20:29.833 --> 20:32.802
And when are we gonna
make up The Sixty Yard...

20:32.804 --> 20:34.704
- What's up, Amy?
- Hey, sweetie, okay.

20:34.706 --> 20:37.574
Um, there's something that I
need to talk to you about.

20:37.576 --> 20:38.842
Oh, gosh, please tell
me that Donald Driver

20:38.844 --> 20:40.209
did not get hurt in practice.

20:40.211 --> 20:42.580
No, gosh, no. No,
no, no, no, no.

20:42.582 --> 20:44.180
No, Greg wants me to go with him

20:44.182 --> 20:46.816
to represent the company
at the graphics expo.

20:46.818 --> 20:48.686
That son of a bitch!

20:48.688 --> 20:50.286
It's a good thing, he
sees potential in me.

20:50.288 --> 20:51.889
- Oh, I like that guy.
- Here's the thing, though.

20:51.891 --> 20:55.059
It's this weekend in Milwaukee.

20:55.061 --> 20:56.826
Not this weekend.

20:56.828 --> 21:00.264
It's the home opener
in our new house.

21:00.266 --> 21:01.865
I know, but here's the thing.

21:01.867 --> 21:03.101
Like, it could be really
good for my career.

21:03.103 --> 21:04.635
Yeah, that's true.

21:04.637 --> 21:06.036
You should go to
Milwaukee this weekend.

21:06.038 --> 21:07.639
No, it's home opener.

21:07.641 --> 21:10.708
We have to park the cars
and we'll be grillin'.

21:10.710 --> 21:12.343
- Yes!
- Oh, gosh.

21:12.345 --> 21:14.079
- Go, have fun.
- Yeah?

21:14.081 --> 21:16.247
Yeah, we'll take
care of the house.

21:16.249 --> 21:18.219
- Okay.
- Okay.

21:20.187 --> 21:22.853
- Say hello to Milwaukee.
- Okay, bye!

21:22.855 --> 21:25.126
Brew crew!

21:38.673 --> 21:41.907
- Let's have some fun.
- Uh, yeah.

21:41.909 --> 21:44.343
With Amy on the sidelines,

21:44.345 --> 21:47.046
the boys changed the game plan.

21:47.048 --> 21:50.683
When she said, add a
few football things,

21:50.685 --> 21:56.222
all they heard was, blah,
blah, beer, football things.

21:56.224 --> 21:57.891
Look what the golf
course was throwing out.

21:57.893 --> 22:00.826
Turf grass! Yes!

22:00.828 --> 22:03.095
Maybe it was the beer,

22:03.097 --> 22:06.866
and maybe it was the lack
of a responsible adult,

22:06.868 --> 22:10.403
- or maybe it was the beer.
- This is nice.

22:10.405 --> 22:12.973
They ushered out a previous life

22:12.975 --> 22:17.244
of a Pier deuce bird emporium
and pillow-riddled couches

22:17.246 --> 22:24.218
to usher in a new life of
fandom and learned priorities,

22:24.220 --> 22:27.954
even stumbling upon
ghosts of legends past.

22:27.956 --> 22:31.159
Whoa! Polano! Suits!

22:31.161 --> 22:35.328
Crookedly justifying
their every intent.

22:35.330 --> 22:37.031
Noice!

22:37.033 --> 22:41.235
Zagger and Polano
took it to the house,

22:41.237 --> 22:43.905
shattering records of the past

22:43.907 --> 22:48.476
and putting up a clearer
future, giving the world...

22:48.478 --> 22:51.212
Now this is a house.

22:51.214 --> 22:53.147
And I'm hammered.

22:53.149 --> 22:56.220
The Sixty Yard Line.

22:59.924 --> 23:03.326
- Welcome to The Sixty.
- Dad's sick.

23:03.328 --> 23:05.294
- Mom told me to give you this.
- Thank you.

23:05.296 --> 23:10.165
Here we have the uppermost
level of The Sixty Yard Line,

23:10.167 --> 23:12.502
the sleeping and
bunking quarters.

23:12.504 --> 23:14.738
Moving on to the
bathroom section

23:14.740 --> 23:17.139
of the Paul Hornung level
where we have the common tub,

23:17.141 --> 23:21.377
along with sink with
hot and cold water.

23:21.379 --> 23:23.413
Uh, question? Uh,
yes, Uncle Mark.

23:23.415 --> 23:25.316
Did you get these mattresses
out of the dumpster?

23:25.318 --> 23:27.818
No. No, we did not find
them in the dumpster.

23:27.820 --> 23:30.087
- They were on the dumpster.
- Nice.

23:30.089 --> 23:32.490
Yeah, uh, question, Debbie?

23:32.492 --> 23:35.760
- Um, where's Amy?
- She's at the work thing.

23:35.762 --> 23:37.093
You know that.

23:37.095 --> 23:38.829
And she helped you
with all this?

23:38.831 --> 23:40.297
Great question, Debbie.

23:40.299 --> 23:42.066
All right, that's it
for the top level.

23:42.068 --> 23:44.135
Let's go to the main level.
Come on in.

23:44.137 --> 23:47.070
Pile in. Try to blend in, Mark.

23:47.072 --> 23:48.939
This is the Brett Favre level,

23:48.941 --> 23:51.976
open concept with
three flat screens.

23:51.978 --> 23:53.410
Uh, yes. Question, Schneebs.

23:53.412 --> 23:55.179
Yes, uh, with three
different screens,

23:55.181 --> 23:56.947
does that mean
there are gonna be

23:56.949 --> 23:58.082
three different games
at the same time?

23:58.084 --> 23:59.984
The answer is no.

23:59.986 --> 24:01.887
What we will do is we will
have two of the flat screens

24:01.889 --> 24:03.921
on the Green Bay game,
and one flat screen

24:03.923 --> 24:06.491
will have stats and scores
so that somebody here

24:06.493 --> 24:08.459
knows that their
team still sucks.

24:08.461 --> 24:10.861
- Go Bears.
- And, as you can see,

24:10.863 --> 24:12.799
my chair is positioned here,

24:12.801 --> 24:15.834
aptly named Fart Starr where
you can find me every Sunday

24:15.836 --> 24:18.905
and sometimes Thanksgiving
Thursdays and playoff Saturdays

24:18.907 --> 24:23.946
if they do arise,
with my stats binder.

24:25.412 --> 24:27.312
Yes, Debbie, you
have a question?

24:27.314 --> 24:30.349
Yes, I, I was wondering
where, where's Amy?

24:30.351 --> 24:32.318
I told you she's at work.
Moving on.

24:32.320 --> 24:34.352
- Here we go!
- Back to the back patio

24:34.354 --> 24:38.358
leads us directly out to the
parking lot of Lambeau Field.

24:38.360 --> 24:40.326
I state the obvious,
because it leads

24:40.328 --> 24:42.963
directly to the parking
lot of Lambeau!

24:42.965 --> 24:45.498
Even I will enjoy watching
games here this season,

24:45.500 --> 24:49.136
so hold onto your boners, folks.
We're in for a juicy ride.

24:49.138 --> 24:51.037
I thought we took boners out
of the tour guide script.

24:51.039 --> 24:52.406
- We did what, now?
- We took boners out

24:52.408 --> 24:54.073
of the tour guide script.

24:54.075 --> 24:56.843
Sorry for saying boners.
Uh, geez.

24:56.845 --> 24:58.946
There I go again. Once
boners roll off your tongue,

24:58.948 --> 25:01.382
it's really hard to
stop saying boners.

25:01.384 --> 25:02.883
All right, moving on.

25:02.885 --> 25:04.352
Now this is the part of the tour

25:04.354 --> 25:06.987
where you Packer scum
get a mini Lam-boner.

25:06.989 --> 25:10.924
When Coach Lombardi was
still here, bless his soul,

25:10.926 --> 25:13.594
he would invite people
over every Sunday night

25:13.596 --> 25:16.597
to his basement for drinks.

25:16.599 --> 25:21.501
I am proud to announce that
I will be bringing back

25:21.503 --> 25:24.140
the Lombardi cocktail hour.

25:27.944 --> 25:29.210
Stop asking where Amy is.

25:29.212 --> 25:31.247
Oh I know where she is.

25:31.249 --> 25:33.084
She's right here.

25:34.618 --> 25:38.287
Oh, much, much sooner
than expected.

25:38.289 --> 25:40.122
Hey.

25:40.124 --> 25:42.991
Welcome home. Awesome.

25:42.993 --> 25:45.661
Check it out. It's The Sixty.

25:45.663 --> 25:47.899
Yeah!

25:49.501 --> 25:53.105
- What is all this?
- A few football things.

25:54.505 --> 25:57.574
And, and I read that
green carpet is calming.

25:57.576 --> 25:59.511
Like Verbena Lemongrass.

26:03.048 --> 26:06.184
Okay. Mm-hm.

26:07.953 --> 26:11.421
She has to probably
unpack, so...

26:23.269 --> 26:25.068
Uh, sorry. Excuse me.

26:25.070 --> 26:28.606
Excuse me, Zagowskis,
uh, and Jablonski.

26:28.608 --> 26:30.607
Uh, first off, thank you
everybody for bringing

26:30.609 --> 26:34.110
a dish of au gratins to our
totally impromptu house tour.

26:34.112 --> 26:36.514
Seriously? It's all au gratin?

26:36.516 --> 26:37.982
No, there's a beef dish.

26:37.984 --> 26:40.551
No, that's just burnt au gratin.

26:40.553 --> 26:44.122
Um, no, we have our first
home game tomorrow

26:44.124 --> 26:46.628
against Polano's baby Bears.

26:47.628 --> 26:49.427
Suck, suck!

26:49.429 --> 26:51.195
All right, we're getting better.

26:51.197 --> 26:52.563
Take it easy.

26:52.565 --> 26:55.166
Let's forgive Polano for
choosing the wrong team

26:55.168 --> 26:57.234
because that's what we do.

26:57.236 --> 27:00.172
We forgive our loved
ones when they mess up.

27:00.174 --> 27:01.974
To The Sixty Yard Line.

27:01.976 --> 27:04.679
To The Sixty Yard Line!

27:22.464 --> 27:24.297
I was gonna solder that.

27:24.299 --> 27:27.533
And resurrect it from the trash?

27:27.535 --> 27:30.340
Hey, come on, Amy. Hold on. Amy.

27:31.407 --> 27:33.275
Does anybody have a spoon?

27:35.143 --> 27:37.077
Amy. Amy.

27:37.079 --> 27:39.413
Amy. Amy, Amy, hold on!
Wait, stop!

27:39.415 --> 27:43.050
Look, apparently I messed up.
I'm sorry.

27:43.052 --> 27:45.351
But you said that I could
add some football stuff.

27:45.353 --> 27:47.754
It's not football stuff.

27:47.756 --> 27:49.791
- It's you.
- Me, what?

27:49.793 --> 27:52.092
You everything.

27:52.094 --> 27:54.596
Just be honest with me.

27:54.598 --> 27:56.164
Do you even wanna marry me?

27:56.166 --> 27:58.632
- Of course I want to marry you.
- When?

27:58.634 --> 28:01.136
Because we haven't
even spoken about it

28:01.138 --> 28:03.037
once since we moved in here.

28:03.039 --> 28:04.539
I just thought that we could
fix this place up together.

28:04.541 --> 28:07.408
But that in there

28:07.410 --> 28:10.145
has nothing to do
with the both of us,

28:10.147 --> 28:14.283
and you know what I'm realizing,
is that it never will.

28:14.285 --> 28:16.718
It's been eight years, Ben.

28:16.720 --> 28:22.123
Eight years of me competing
with a football team

28:22.125 --> 28:23.995
that I can never beat.

28:41.380 --> 28:42.344
Oh, my gosh.

28:42.346 --> 28:44.281
No, no Amy. No, no, no.

28:44.283 --> 28:47.350
You shouldn't drive.

28:47.352 --> 28:50.320
I feel, feel like I'm
having trouble breathing.

28:50.322 --> 28:53.189
I know. Ice cream is
gonna help with that.

28:53.191 --> 28:56.826
My mom, she always asked
me what I was doing,

28:56.828 --> 29:00.198
and I

29:06.405 --> 29:10.141
- Am I not good enough?
- Oh, Amy, yes.

29:10.143 --> 29:13.680
You are, you are more
than good enough.

29:20.319 --> 29:22.388
My heart is so sore.

29:23.890 --> 29:27.625
I'm gonna talk
about my feelings.

29:27.627 --> 29:29.560
- Okay?
- Okay.

29:32.599 --> 29:37.236
She means a lot to me.

29:37.238 --> 29:39.841
Oh, my god, dude, I'm sorry.
I can't do this.

29:40.641 --> 29:42.574
I can't do this.

29:42.576 --> 29:44.776
- Do you want to drink a keg?
- Yes!

29:44.778 --> 29:47.845
You can stay here as
much as you want, girl.

29:47.847 --> 29:49.548
Okay, that's not healthy.

29:49.550 --> 29:51.250
You can stay here as
much as you want, man.

29:51.252 --> 29:52.451
You don't have to tell me that.

29:52.453 --> 29:54.522
I was going to anyway.

29:57.492 --> 30:00.425
I don't, I don't
know what that was.

30:00.427 --> 30:02.295
- Party.
- You're my friend.

30:02.297 --> 30:03.163
You're my friend.

30:03.165 --> 30:03.829
You hungry, bro?

30:03.831 --> 30:04.897
You hungry?

30:04.899 --> 30:07.166
Right in the mouth hole.

30:13.475 --> 30:16.644
Sometimes I sit in the car by
myself for like four hours.

30:17.914 --> 30:20.250
He's a shipping boy.

30:21.650 --> 30:23.283
I thought you said
a shabing boy.

30:26.489 --> 30:27.721
I just got snot in 'em.

30:27.723 --> 30:29.389
Oh, it makes 'em better!

30:30.592 --> 30:32.425
It's just that Polano is...

30:32.427 --> 30:34.895
- He didn't do anything wrong.
- What?

30:34.897 --> 30:38.265
Sitting at home with Tracey
like watching rom-coms.

30:38.267 --> 30:39.733
Yeah, no.

30:39.735 --> 30:43.838
Is it weird that it's,
I'm having fun,

30:43.840 --> 30:46.441
but I'm so sad?

30:46.443 --> 30:47.776
Let's call Tracey.

30:50.647 --> 30:53.315
It's gonna be okay. It is.

30:53.317 --> 30:54.816
It's gonna be okay.

30:54.818 --> 30:56.751
- How do you know that?
- So call...

30:56.753 --> 30:58.787
- Which end is the bottom end?
- This is the end

30:58.789 --> 31:00.589
that you listen to, and this
is the end that you talk in.

31:00.591 --> 31:01.857
- That's dangerous.
- I know.

31:01.859 --> 31:03.428
I love you.

31:05.662 --> 31:07.396
I love you, too.

31:07.398 --> 31:08.897
- Put there and...
- Well don't, you don't

31:08.899 --> 31:10.733
listen to a phone like this.
It's like this.

31:10.735 --> 31:12.667
Okay go, you call, you call.

31:12.669 --> 31:14.505
Shit. I forgot her number.

31:15.840 --> 31:19.708
- Good night.
- Good night.

31:19.710 --> 31:24.548
- Let the good times roll.
- Mm-hmm.

31:24.550 --> 31:26.282
Who sings that song?

31:26.284 --> 31:27.984
- The Cars!
- Yeah, that's the band.

31:27.986 --> 31:30.520
Oh my god, it is! No, outside!

31:30.522 --> 31:33.393
- The cars!
- Come on!

31:53.479 --> 31:57.681
Oh, my gosh.

32:05.691 --> 32:07.558
Hey, excuse me. Hi, hey, uh,

32:07.560 --> 32:09.293
you have to pay to
park here, please.

32:09.295 --> 32:12.831
- You're not Rick.
- No, I'm the new owner.

32:12.833 --> 32:15.566
Well, hello,

32:15.568 --> 32:17.638
Hottie Homeowner.

32:18.905 --> 32:21.506
- I'm Vanessa.
- Hi, Vanessa, yeah.

32:21.508 --> 32:23.941
This is for the money. You
have to pay to park here.

32:23.943 --> 32:27.915
Oh, calm down. I usually
collect it for Rick.

32:29.816 --> 32:31.252
Here you go.

32:34.555 --> 32:39.028
- What, this is it?
- Mm-hm, $10 a car.

32:40.028 --> 32:41.894
You're super cute.

32:41.896 --> 32:44.730
It's $40 per car.

32:44.732 --> 32:47.400
Ugh, we gotta go
get the other 30.

32:47.402 --> 32:49.035
Whose car is this? Where
are these people?

32:49.037 --> 32:52.939
Everyone's gone into Lambeau.

32:52.941 --> 32:55.108
- Why aren't you there?
- 'Cause I got kicked out.

32:55.110 --> 32:57.977
Already? They opened the
gates 10 minutes ago.

32:57.979 --> 32:59.578
Polano, let's siphon the gas

32:59.580 --> 33:01.515
out of some of these
cars and sell it.

33:01.517 --> 33:03.049
Dude, I'm not going to
the hospital again.

33:03.051 --> 33:06.019
On game day at Lambeau Field,

33:06.021 --> 33:11.392
lawns become parking lots,
and strangers become family.

33:11.394 --> 33:13.728
I've been coming to
games for 25 years.

33:13.730 --> 33:16.063
The tailgate is a
big part of it.

33:16.065 --> 33:20.633
It's a big party, but it's
like being with family.

33:20.635 --> 33:23.069
Everybody's your brother,
your cousin, your whatever.

33:23.071 --> 33:25.973
They hand you a beer, a brat,
and you start having fun.

33:25.975 --> 33:27.642
Don't even have a
clue who they are.

33:27.644 --> 33:29.143
Best place to
tailgate right here.

33:29.145 --> 33:30.778
Best place on Earth.

33:30.780 --> 33:33.614
Everyone is welcomed everywhere,

33:33.616 --> 33:36.117
including Zagger's bathroom.

33:36.119 --> 33:40.590
It's terrible. Roger's gonna
go wherever he wants.

33:43.093 --> 33:46.428
It got weird last night
at dinner, fast.

33:46.430 --> 33:49.664
You got weird at dinner
last night fast.

33:49.666 --> 33:53.802
I just was trying to
handle the situation.

33:53.804 --> 33:55.471
Hey, if it's any consolation,

33:55.473 --> 33:57.606
that Vanessa girl wants
to squat on your brat.

33:57.608 --> 33:59.509
- Yuck.
- Dude, the quickest way

33:59.511 --> 34:01.644
to get over a break-up
is with a Gong Show.

34:01.646 --> 34:03.179
What's a Gong Show?

34:03.181 --> 34:05.515
You know, a chick that
you bang like a gong,

34:05.517 --> 34:07.077
and then you get her
the hell off stage.

34:09.485 --> 34:10.753
A Gong Show.

34:10.755 --> 34:12.522
- I like that.
- Right?

34:12.524 --> 34:14.190
- I'm not banging the Gong Show.
- You should.

34:14.193 --> 34:15.993
No, I will not be
banging anything.

34:15.995 --> 34:20.563
How'd you get this
grass to grow in here?

34:20.565 --> 34:22.697
It's turf grass, it's fake.

34:22.699 --> 34:25.168
Well it doesn't soak
up pee very well.

34:25.170 --> 34:28.205
Please tell me you're joking.

34:28.206 --> 34:30.109
Okay, I'm joking.

34:32.143 --> 34:35.511
Sorry about the parking money.

34:35.513 --> 34:39.483
Why are you sorry? It's done.

34:39.485 --> 34:40.652
Hey, will you bang my buddy?

34:40.654 --> 34:42.953
- Dude, no.
- What?

34:42.955 --> 34:45.456
- Come on. He's joking.
- I will.

34:45.458 --> 34:47.157
- I'm not joking.
- No, I'm not single.

34:47.159 --> 34:48.659
- She just said she will.
- I'm not single.

34:48.661 --> 34:49.627
You're going through a divorce.

34:49.629 --> 34:50.962
Not fully.

34:50.964 --> 34:52.032
Amy?

34:52.799 --> 34:53.833
Hi, Ma.

34:55.168 --> 34:57.872
Yeah, just give me a second.

35:00.073 --> 35:01.506
Hey, Ma.

35:01.508 --> 35:02.908
Debbie told me about last night.

35:02.910 --> 35:04.876
Yeah, uh, it's not
a big deal, Ma.

35:04.878 --> 35:08.213
No big deal? Benjamin
Donald Zagowski!

35:08.215 --> 35:11.716
Hey, buddy, I saw that big
buck out off County 8!

35:11.718 --> 35:13.686
How do you expect us to
come over to the house

35:13.688 --> 35:17.122
when you have thrown your
wedding out the window

35:17.124 --> 35:20.492
to get it! I do not support
that kind of behavior, Ben.

35:20.494 --> 35:23.128
Okay, Ma. The game's
back on, I gotta go.

35:23.130 --> 35:26.165
No, you hold it. Look, do you
think that I like the fact

35:26.167 --> 35:30.569
that your father spent so
much time welding saw blades

35:30.571 --> 35:33.239
and painting deer on
them when we first met?

35:33.241 --> 35:36.243
Ma, look, Dad welding and
painting saws is a hobby.

35:36.245 --> 35:40.013
- The Packers are my life.
- Make Amy your life.

35:40.015 --> 35:41.915
Look, Ma, I don't even
know what that means.

35:41.917 --> 35:43.783
What that means is that
it's called compromise,

35:43.785 --> 35:45.551
- something that...
- All right.

35:45.553 --> 35:46.719
- You're gonna need to...
- Ma, I love you, bye.

35:46.721 --> 35:47.954
'Cause that is how your

35:47.956 --> 35:49.222
father and I deal with the...

35:49.224 --> 35:50.557
Hello?

35:50.559 --> 35:51.795
Ben!

35:59.202 --> 36:01.068
You guys got lucky.

36:01.070 --> 36:04.204
It's like Cutler forgot what
color jersey to throw to.

36:04.206 --> 36:07.140
I gotta piss. Bears suck.

36:07.142 --> 36:09.010
I feel like it's gonna
be a good season.

36:09.012 --> 36:10.845
I got a good feeling
about this season.

36:10.847 --> 36:13.114
I think that this
house is the key

36:13.116 --> 36:16.019
to just making everything right.

36:18.555 --> 36:19.656
Amy!

36:22.859 --> 36:24.792
- Amy.
- No, you need to fix this.

36:24.794 --> 36:26.228
Well, I'm trying.

36:26.230 --> 36:28.663
I'm gonna save up the
wedding fund again.

36:28.665 --> 36:30.299
We're gonna have a house party!

36:30.301 --> 36:32.935
Five dollar cups, wedding fund.

36:32.937 --> 36:34.335
Hey, I need to get to my car.

36:34.337 --> 36:37.139
- I'm blocked in.
- What? Yeah.

36:37.141 --> 36:39.775
Just, you're gonna
have to deal with it.

36:39.777 --> 36:41.911
- Okay, huddle.
- Yeah.

36:41.913 --> 36:43.813
Okay, I'm gonna get
Amy to come inside,

36:43.815 --> 36:45.782
and you guys sit down and
talk out whatever it is

36:45.784 --> 36:47.983
that you need to apologize
for, which is everything.

36:47.985 --> 36:50.586
Yeah, I think that
you should stay here

36:50.588 --> 36:53.121
and go into the party, and
that way Amy will stay, too.

36:53.123 --> 36:54.791
Good. Break.

36:54.793 --> 36:56.729
- Oh, come on.
- Amy!

36:57.829 --> 37:01.031
She left. She was my ride.

37:01.033 --> 37:03.667
Okay, I guess I'm staying here.

37:03.669 --> 37:05.234
- Friend of yours?
- No.

37:05.236 --> 37:07.206
- What are you still doing here?
- Rude.

37:08.640 --> 37:11.975
This party is lame.
We need peeps.

37:11.977 --> 37:13.977
I bartend at Stadium View.

37:13.979 --> 37:15.645
- Oh, of course you do.
- I knew it.

37:15.647 --> 37:18.147
I'm gonna bring a
whole crowd over.

37:18.149 --> 37:19.248
10 bucks a cup.

37:19.250 --> 37:20.884
All right, yeah.

37:20.886 --> 37:22.319
- Let's go to Stadium View.
- Come on.

37:22.321 --> 37:23.654
No, I'm gonna stay.
I'll stay here

37:23.656 --> 37:24.923
in case the people come over,

37:24.925 --> 37:26.123
then I'll be here
waiting for 'em.

37:26.125 --> 37:27.157
And I gotta update my game log.

37:27.159 --> 37:30.128
- Dude, come on.
- Okay.

37:30.130 --> 37:32.297
But when Vee-Vee comes back,

37:32.299 --> 37:37.137
we're gonna put that
ex-fiancÃ© far behind you.

37:39.373 --> 37:40.608
Come on.

37:42.041 --> 37:44.976
- I'm gonna go with him, them.
- Okay.

37:44.978 --> 37:47.646
I paid for easy out!

37:47.648 --> 37:49.952
I don't even know
what that means!

38:06.100 --> 38:09.068
No, don't go to voicemail.

38:09.070 --> 38:11.272
- What do you want?
- Oh, hi.

38:12.373 --> 38:14.810
Right, um.

38:15.844 --> 38:17.277
Um...

38:17.279 --> 38:22.815
I, uh, I just wanted, uh,

38:22.817 --> 38:26.319
I wanted you to know that
your clothes are missing,

38:26.321 --> 38:30.090
and I put flyers up all
over the neighborhood,

38:30.092 --> 38:34.194
so hopefully, somebody
will return them.

38:34.196 --> 38:36.099
Along with a puppy.

38:37.399 --> 38:39.970
Well, I found my clothes.

38:41.704 --> 38:43.340
Sans puppy.

38:44.974 --> 38:45.974
Good.

38:47.010 --> 38:51.044
- How's the house?
- Good.

38:51.046 --> 38:55.251
Strangers keep coming in
and using the bathroom.

38:56.218 --> 38:58.287
Why did you ignore me?

39:04.995 --> 39:07.799
Maybe I overreacted a little.

39:08.998 --> 39:11.770
I just love you so much, Ben.

39:13.002 --> 39:15.406
Oh, my god.

39:17.308 --> 39:18.376
Ben?

39:21.846 --> 39:24.213
Hey, aren't you Mr. Hot Back?

39:24.215 --> 39:26.515
And what, what is this,
turf on your floor?

39:26.517 --> 39:30.153
Yes. Mark Tauscher, it is.

39:30.155 --> 39:32.088
It's like a real field.

39:32.090 --> 39:37.327
Yes, John Kuhn.

39:37.329 --> 39:38.794
It is.

39:38.796 --> 39:40.229
I told you I'd
bring back people.

39:40.231 --> 39:43.968
Not just people, players, playa.

39:46.070 --> 39:49.940
Well, welcome to The Sixty.

39:49.942 --> 39:55.011
Come on.

39:55.013 --> 39:56.946
Uh, I gotta, I have to
call, I was talking to...

39:56.948 --> 39:58.815
- Zagger?
- Yes.

39:58.817 --> 40:00.451
You need to party, all right?

40:00.453 --> 40:04.154
You have professional football
players downstairs waiting.

40:04.156 --> 40:05.989
- Mm-hmm.
- Now get your Packer

40:05.991 --> 40:07.993
ass downstairs.

40:15.536 --> 40:17.903
- Hello.
- $10.

40:17.905 --> 40:20.807
- There you go.
- Have fun.

40:25.244 --> 40:26.845
Hey, how's it goin'?

40:41.830 --> 40:43.261
Every championship team
since the inception

40:43.263 --> 40:45.096
of the west coast
offense has had

40:45.098 --> 40:46.866
less than 10% missed
assignments on the O Line,

40:46.868 --> 40:48.533
plus seven minutes
time of possession.

40:48.535 --> 40:50.535
- That shit's crazy.
- Oh, he's got so much

40:50.537 --> 40:52.071
football knowledge,
it's borderline weird.

40:52.073 --> 40:53.138
Yeah, he crunches more

40:53.140 --> 40:55.107
numbers than a calculator.

40:55.109 --> 40:57.176
The last three seasons, you
two have had a combined

40:57.178 --> 40:59.111
86% successful-blocks-
to-yards-gained.

40:59.113 --> 41:01.248
That's 12% higher
than league average.

41:01.250 --> 41:03.983
You can pass that shit on
to the rest of the O Line.

41:03.985 --> 41:05.452
- Okay.
- Hm-hm.

41:05.454 --> 41:08.922
Like I said, crunching
numbers like a CNN,

41:08.924 --> 41:10.590
like a business insider.

41:10.592 --> 41:12.492
When you match up with
Strahan in two weeks,

41:12.494 --> 41:15.528
he has a tell of when
he's gonna blitz.

41:15.530 --> 41:18.498
When he comes to the line, if he
stretches his back, he's comin'.

41:18.500 --> 41:20.199
- You being serious?
- That's right.

41:20.201 --> 41:22.001
All right, man,
I'll take a look.

41:22.003 --> 41:23.269
Typical Zagger,
crunching numbers...

41:23.271 --> 41:24.439
Dude, why are you not a scout?

41:24.441 --> 41:27.075
I tell him that all the time!

41:27.077 --> 41:28.442
You should feel this man's arms.

41:28.444 --> 41:30.544
Deb, I, no.

41:30.546 --> 41:34.348
I can't be a scout. That's not...
This is great.

41:34.350 --> 41:36.584
You guys are great. You're
welcome here anytime.

41:36.586 --> 41:39.486
I'll be honest, man, I love
the Lombardi Cocktail Hour.

41:39.488 --> 41:41.488
Yeah, we will
definitely be back.

41:41.490 --> 41:43.624
You guys wanna come to
my open mic next week?

41:43.626 --> 41:46.229
I think we're good, man.

41:46.963 --> 41:47.998
Karen!

41:50.134 --> 41:51.599
That actually happens
all the time.

42:11.355 --> 42:13.122
Ladies and gentlemen,

42:13.124 --> 42:17.126
it's time for a special show
for the man of the hour.

42:41.520 --> 42:43.156
You came back.

42:47.159 --> 42:49.726
I'm sorry I was,
my phone earlier,

42:49.728 --> 42:54.331
but you cut off a
basketball jersey.

42:57.703 --> 43:00.738
I'm sorry that I
got carried away.

43:00.740 --> 43:03.441
We got hammered and we
did the whole place up.

43:03.443 --> 43:07.178
I'm sorry, but I wanna carry
you to a priest in the...

43:07.180 --> 43:09.146
Let's get married. Let's do it.

43:09.148 --> 43:11.351
Let's do it.

43:12.385 --> 43:13.921
Let's do it.

43:16.155 --> 43:18.657
Zagger, Zagger, Zagger,

43:18.659 --> 43:23.361
Zagger, Zagger, Zagger,
Zagger, Zagger

43:23.363 --> 43:26.665
Zagger, Zagger, Zagger, Zagger.

43:26.667 --> 43:28.734
- Amy?
- Zagger, Zagger, Zagger!

43:28.736 --> 43:31.339
Amy, did ya you hear me?

43:33.007 --> 43:36.708
Yeah, yeah. Uh, Bill Clinton.

43:36.710 --> 43:39.578
- Hillary.
- Hillary.

43:39.580 --> 43:42.447
Yeah, so, um, I'm next in line,

43:42.449 --> 43:44.516
and I am totally nervous.

43:44.518 --> 43:46.618
I'm sweating like Ellen Richards

43:46.620 --> 43:49.356
on the first day of
chemistry class at MIT.

43:49.358 --> 43:52.760
So the book slips
right out of my hand,

43:52.762 --> 43:54.327
goes right over Hillary's head,

43:54.329 --> 43:58.564
and this is how great
she is, she says,

43:58.566 --> 44:02.468
"Should I make the inscription
out to Butterfingers?"

44:02.470 --> 44:04.306
And she did!

44:05.441 --> 44:07.374
Well, she is pretty amazing.

44:07.376 --> 44:10.347
Well, I mean not
as amazing as you.

44:12.348 --> 44:16.051
Rick! Thanks for coming
to the party last night.

44:16.053 --> 44:19.219
I, uh, your fiancÃ©
is late again.

44:19.221 --> 44:23.190
He's not my fiancÃ©.
Not anymore, anyway.

44:23.192 --> 44:25.326
Interesting.

44:25.328 --> 44:27.462
- Hey, Zippy!
- Oh, I don't...

44:27.464 --> 44:28.596
Can I see ya a sec, pal?

44:28.598 --> 44:29.730
- No, I...
- Me?

44:29.732 --> 44:31.065
Yeah.

44:31.067 --> 44:32.766
Hey, hey, hey, there you are.

44:32.768 --> 44:35.574
- Where did you go?
- No.

44:37.074 --> 44:41.110
- Hey, guy.
- Greg. This is Greg.

44:41.112 --> 44:45.146
He's a regional manager.
He's my boss.

44:45.148 --> 44:47.316
Your boss, actually.

44:47.318 --> 44:49.254
Right, I knew that.

44:50.088 --> 44:51.753
So, Zippy...

44:51.755 --> 44:53.488
- Zagger.
- Uh-huh.

44:53.490 --> 44:55.458
It seems that the
only part of you

44:55.460 --> 44:58.594
doing any actual work around
here anymore is your liver.

44:58.596 --> 45:01.263
I know, right? Whew.

45:01.265 --> 45:04.600
And you're late always.

45:04.602 --> 45:06.569
So...

45:06.571 --> 45:08.404
You're terminated.

45:08.406 --> 45:11.174
What, you mean like fired?
Is that what you mean?

45:11.176 --> 45:13.410
I'm sorry I'm late.

45:13.412 --> 45:16.178
Um, I always, I, I'll
get everything shipped.

45:16.180 --> 45:19.850
I always do. I mean, sometimes
barely, but I'll get it done.

45:19.852 --> 45:24.822
Gabrielle Bonheur Chanel,

45:24.824 --> 45:27.757
aka Coco Chanel,

45:27.759 --> 45:33.431
once said, in order
to be irreplaceable,

45:33.433 --> 45:36.070
one must always be different.

45:37.737 --> 45:42.440
You make no difference, thus you
are completely replaceable.

45:42.442 --> 45:46.710
I'm pretty sure Gabrielle
Bernerd did not say that.

45:46.712 --> 45:47.849
She did.

45:51.251 --> 45:54.185
There you go. On the house.

45:54.187 --> 45:55.354
No hard feelings.

45:58.425 --> 46:02.229
- Oh, you're serious?
- Oh, yeah.

46:17.379 --> 46:19.681
- Gabriel Barnyard this!
- Nice.

46:32.960 --> 46:35.229
Just so you know, I
had nothing to do

46:35.231 --> 46:38.499
with what happened back there.

46:38.501 --> 46:41.702
What's going on? You were at
the house last night, right?

46:41.704 --> 46:44.204
- Yeah.
- Okay, cool.

46:44.206 --> 46:46.606
Great, 'cause it was awesome.
It was hot.

46:46.608 --> 46:50.711
Oh. I'm glad that you
thought it was hot.

46:50.713 --> 46:52.579
Yeah.

46:52.581 --> 46:56.383
I thought it was hot, but for
some reason you're mad at me.

46:56.385 --> 46:57.821
You know what?

46:59.589 --> 47:01.589
I'm like super glad
that he fired you.

47:01.591 --> 47:04.558
- Do you know why?
- No.

47:04.560 --> 47:06.530
'Cause this way...

47:09.832 --> 47:13.370
I don't ever have
to see you again.

47:16.672 --> 47:18.873
The wrong plays were
getting signaled

47:18.875 --> 47:21.476
from both sides of the ball.

47:21.478 --> 47:25.414
Zagger had hung in the pocket
too long and was sacked.

47:25.416 --> 47:29.452
Plus, he inadvertently
banged the gong.

47:29.454 --> 47:31.686
For the first time
in eight years,

47:31.688 --> 47:34.356
he'd pushed Amy away for good,

47:34.358 --> 47:39.461
leaving him unemployed,
broke and confused.

47:39.463 --> 47:43.666
Why am I walking? I drove.

47:43.668 --> 47:47.471
Champions are not made
in times of triumph.

47:47.473 --> 47:50.607
They are made in
times of adversity,

47:50.609 --> 47:55.248
and this time, Zagger was
not about to hang it up.

47:56.781 --> 47:59.283
What once was a weekend gig,

47:59.285 --> 48:02.654
would become a full-time
labor of love.

48:04.290 --> 48:06.723
These captains of car-parking

48:06.725 --> 48:09.893
continued to put in
the work on off days,

48:09.895 --> 48:13.664
which led to success
on game days,

48:13.666 --> 48:17.034
doing it all in the
shadow of Lambeau Field.

48:17.036 --> 48:19.570
This is awesome.

48:19.572 --> 48:22.907
Zagger was a new
man, a changed man,

48:22.909 --> 48:26.978
and every fan knows that
change is part of the game.

48:26.980 --> 48:32.583
Seasons change, concussion
protocols change,

48:32.585 --> 48:38.056
relatively normal people change,
get into weird costumes,

48:38.058 --> 48:41.392
and sometimes, players
change teams,

48:41.394 --> 48:45.666
which may be the hardest
change of all to accept.

48:49.336 --> 48:51.602
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

48:51.604 --> 48:53.105
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

48:53.107 --> 48:55.707
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yep.

48:55.709 --> 48:57.475
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

48:57.477 --> 48:59.814
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

49:08.690 --> 49:12.559
Despite Zagger's newfound
leap into popularity,

49:12.561 --> 49:15.929
Green Bay is still a small town.

49:15.931 --> 49:18.398
Whether it was in the
playbook or not,

49:18.400 --> 49:21.467
Amy and Zagger's
paths would cross

49:21.469 --> 49:23.671
like strangers in the night.

49:23.673 --> 49:26.073
They were on opposite sidelines,

49:26.075 --> 49:30.711
yet acutely aware of
each other's every play.

49:30.713 --> 49:34.714
Zagger lined up in Fart
Starr for every game,

49:34.716 --> 49:39.819
and The Sixty became like
Graceland for Cheeseheads.

49:39.821 --> 49:43.457
They came, including
former players.

49:43.459 --> 49:45.558
I took about four, five steps,

49:45.560 --> 49:49.530
got nailed by the The
Fridge, knocked out.

49:49.532 --> 49:51.866
One of my teammates
come over and says,

49:51.868 --> 49:53.668
"Hey Gary, you gotta get up.

49:53.670 --> 49:55.971
It's Monday night.
Your mom is watching."

49:57.808 --> 49:59.840
- Current players.
- Electrolyte forms

49:59.842 --> 50:02.110
when soluble sodium or potassium

50:02.112 --> 50:04.612
ionizes in a solvent
such as water,

50:04.614 --> 50:06.081
and for that, my friends,

50:06.083 --> 50:08.683
you can thank thermodynamics
and solation.

50:08.685 --> 50:10.819
And heads of state.

50:10.821 --> 50:12.588
- Mayor Schmitt?
- Right.

50:12.590 --> 50:13.756
Mayor Schmitt!

50:13.758 --> 50:14.756
Mayor of Green Bay.

50:14.758 --> 50:16.091
Keep it down, man, all right?

50:16.093 --> 50:17.626
I don't want everyone
knowing I'm here.

50:17.628 --> 50:18.794
- Keep it low key.
- Right, right.

50:18.796 --> 50:20.129
I understand.

50:20.131 --> 50:21.731
Speaking of key,

50:21.733 --> 50:24.700
you think I can get the old...

50:24.702 --> 50:25.934
- Key to the city?
- Yeah.

50:25.936 --> 50:28.470
No. How 'bout a pen?

50:28.472 --> 50:30.673
- Give the guy a pen.
- Sweet.

50:30.675 --> 50:34.075
Zagger became the
man of the hour.

50:34.077 --> 50:35.545
Pen to the city!

50:41.053 --> 50:43.119
- Uh, Kristen.
- What would you say has

50:43.121 --> 50:46.022
- been the key to your success?
- Well, it's been a team effort.

50:46.024 --> 50:47.790
Everyone's really stepping up,

50:47.792 --> 50:49.525
and we couldn't have done
it without the team.

50:49.527 --> 50:50.993
- Zagger, Zagger!
- Polano!

50:50.995 --> 50:52.128
- Yeah, call.
- Is it true that

50:52.130 --> 50:53.764
parties and parking cars

50:53.766 --> 50:55.031
is your full-time
job now that you've

50:55.033 --> 50:56.732
been a victim of layoffs?

50:56.734 --> 50:58.101
Layoffs?

50:58.103 --> 51:01.573
She's talking 'bout layoffs?
Burke.

51:01.575 --> 51:03.240
Look, some party guests
have accused The Sixty

51:03.242 --> 51:05.910
of having skunky beer.
Care to comment?

51:05.912 --> 51:07.744
The cases looked fresh.

51:07.746 --> 51:10.747
If you want to down a
glass, then down a glass,

51:10.749 --> 51:12.783
but the beers are what
we thought they were,

51:12.785 --> 51:14.017
and we let 'em off the hook!

51:14.019 --> 51:15.179
All right, no more questions.

51:16.889 --> 51:18.622
Hey, G, remember in 2003

51:18.624 --> 51:20.224
when you ran that
98 yard touchdown?

51:20.226 --> 51:25.029
Like I'm about to do on you! Oh!

51:25.031 --> 51:26.899
What?

51:26.901 --> 51:28.600
I remember it, I remember
when you did that.

51:28.602 --> 51:30.069
It was like immediately
afterwards,

51:30.071 --> 51:33.708
I turned to my fiancÃ©,
and I was like...

51:41.082 --> 51:43.082
I was like that was
the longest run

51:43.084 --> 51:45.583
from scrimmage in
Lambeau history.

51:45.585 --> 51:48.921
Look, Zagger, I know
you're a rookie

51:48.923 --> 51:51.191
to this popularity thing.

51:51.193 --> 51:54.760
You have a whole bunch of people
calling themselves your friend,

51:54.762 --> 51:56.829
but when all that fades away,

51:56.831 --> 52:00.202
you gonna need someone
that knows you.

52:01.670 --> 52:03.202
So do you have,

52:03.204 --> 52:05.137
do you have an invoice
from January then?

52:05.139 --> 52:08.108
Yeah, I spoke to Troy,
and he said that

52:08.110 --> 52:11.245
he can change the figures here.

52:11.247 --> 52:15.917
I think, um, you can see
here that if we do,

52:15.919 --> 52:19.923
I mean, it will be a... What?

52:22.591 --> 52:24.892
You got a little
something on your face.

52:24.894 --> 52:26.826
Oh, my god.

52:26.828 --> 52:29.129
- Is it gone?
- No, it's...

52:29.131 --> 52:31.064
- No?
- No, it's right...

52:31.066 --> 52:32.101
Here?

52:33.836 --> 52:35.873
- Yeah.
- Is that okay?

52:44.047 --> 52:45.683
Did you get it?

52:49.753 --> 52:51.789
- It's a freckle.
- Okay.

53:00.131 --> 53:01.798
- Oh!
- Oh.

53:01.800 --> 53:02.966
No, you really do have
shit on your face.

53:02.968 --> 53:05.267
Oh, my gosh. Okay.

53:05.269 --> 53:09.205
Vee-Vee, uh, Vanessa, cheese me.

53:09.207 --> 53:12.609
Now, cheese nuts.

53:12.611 --> 53:14.644
Close your eyes.
Cover your eyes.

53:14.646 --> 53:16.245
- Okay, I'll go first.
- Yeah, okay.

53:16.247 --> 53:20.883
What college did
Reggie White go to?

53:20.885 --> 53:22.618
That one's easy.

53:22.620 --> 53:25.655
I know this one, I know it.
It's, uh...

53:25.657 --> 53:27.661
- Tennessee.
- Yes!

53:28.661 --> 53:30.360
- Yeah!
- Okay, my turn.

53:30.362 --> 53:32.862
How many yards did Tony
Canadeo run for in 1949?

53:32.864 --> 53:36.766
What? No sane person knows that
off the top of their head.

53:38.703 --> 53:41.704
God, Tony Canadeo
doesn't even know this!

53:41.706 --> 53:42.808
The clock.

53:43.808 --> 53:47.011
- 589?
- So wrong!

53:50.249 --> 53:51.682
That was not Gouda.

53:55.388 --> 53:56.955
Debra.

53:56.957 --> 53:58.323
Amy left her leather
jacket at The Sixty.

53:58.325 --> 53:59.390
You need to take
it to her at work.

53:59.392 --> 54:00.658
You need to take

54:00.660 --> 54:01.892
it to her at the office

54:01.894 --> 54:03.127
because all of her
stuff is gone.

54:03.129 --> 54:04.896
Benjamin, take her the jacket.

54:04.898 --> 54:07.300
I don't have the jacket. Quit.

54:09.336 --> 54:11.036
Debra, I might have the jacket.

54:11.038 --> 54:13.371
Good!

54:13.373 --> 54:17.745
- Field trip.
- Can I get a ride to work?

54:36.698 --> 54:41.167
Zagger?

54:41.169 --> 54:43.704
Oh, my gosh, are you okay?

54:43.706 --> 54:46.405
Your skin tone screams I got a
disease in the Oregon Trail.

54:46.407 --> 54:49.910
Yeah, Aimerz is right.

54:49.912 --> 54:51.845
You look like you might
have cholera, pal.

54:51.847 --> 54:56.082
Aimerz? You and he are
doing the Aimerz thing?

54:56.084 --> 54:58.084
So did you bring my jacket?

54:58.086 --> 55:02.359
Yeah, we have a fundraiser for
the women's prison tonight.

55:03.426 --> 55:06.127
What? You two are dating?

55:06.129 --> 55:07.295
- Well...
- Yeah.

55:07.297 --> 55:09.163
Great. Yeah, I mean

55:09.165 --> 55:11.232
I'm plowing some,
seeing someone, too.

55:11.234 --> 55:13.069
Gong, Vanessa!

55:14.404 --> 55:16.103
- What?
- Where'd she go?

55:16.105 --> 55:17.373
There she is.

55:19.274 --> 55:20.775
Come on.

55:20.777 --> 55:24.416
- And there's the jacket.
- Hello.

55:27.818 --> 55:28.983
- Give me the jacket.
- What are you doing?

55:28.985 --> 55:30.084
We're giving her the jacket.

55:30.086 --> 55:32.056
I'm gonna be cold.

55:33.157 --> 55:35.224
It's gonna be cold for me.

55:35.226 --> 55:37.295
We talked about this.

55:38.095 --> 55:39.798
There, returned.

56:16.434 --> 56:19.202
Okay, okay, yeah, that's it.
We gotta go.

56:19.204 --> 56:21.005
You guys got the prison
chicks thing, so let's go.

56:21.007 --> 56:23.175
That sounds hot. Can we go?

56:25.076 --> 56:26.309
Do you have butter on your lips?

56:26.311 --> 56:28.244
I ran out of ChapStick.

56:28.246 --> 56:30.313
In the final game of the season,

56:30.315 --> 56:34.050
the Packers won, earning
them a trip to the...

56:34.052 --> 56:38.189
Play-offs!

56:38.191 --> 56:40.457
It's play-off time, boys!

56:40.459 --> 56:43.361
Let's get this
pre-party started.

56:43.363 --> 56:47.033
Kick it!

57:00.480 --> 57:03.181
Did I make the right choice?

57:03.183 --> 57:07.219
Obviously, your team's
in the play-offs.

57:07.221 --> 57:10.523
I know what you need. I know it.

57:10.525 --> 57:13.059
You need to Farley
a coffee table.

57:13.061 --> 57:17.163
Huh? Right, buddy? Chris Farley?

57:17.165 --> 57:20.032
Farley, you know, something
Wisco and Chi-town

57:20.034 --> 57:22.068
can agree upon.

57:22.070 --> 57:23.903
All right, that's what
I'm talking about.

57:23.905 --> 57:25.606
Go get a coffee table, buddy.

57:25.608 --> 57:26.608
Huh?

58:04.681 --> 58:07.681
- Do not touch my stuff.
- What are you doing?

58:07.683 --> 58:10.250
I am protecting my valuables.
What are you doing?

58:10.252 --> 58:13.021
- I live here.
- So do I.

58:13.023 --> 58:15.124
- What?
- I've been here since '95,

58:15.126 --> 58:17.626
- ever since Rick took me in.
- How have we never seen you?

58:17.628 --> 58:19.327
I think the better question is

58:19.329 --> 58:21.497
why have you never looked
in your garage before?

58:21.499 --> 58:23.164
Look, I just keep quiet.

58:23.166 --> 58:26.001
I watch the games
on my TV by myself.

58:26.003 --> 58:29.338
I am very superstitious.
So please leave.

58:29.340 --> 58:33.142
Um, hold it. This is my house.

58:33.144 --> 58:35.210
I don't know who you are,

58:35.212 --> 58:39.017
so just put down the sword.

58:40.285 --> 58:43.422
You pronounce the
W in sword, too?

58:52.464 --> 58:53.900
Have a seat.

58:55.299 --> 58:57.567
- Sit down.
- No.

58:57.569 --> 58:59.606
Sit down, come on.

59:01.641 --> 59:03.943
My name's Dusty Watkins.

59:05.110 --> 59:08.044
- I'm adopted.
- Oh.

59:08.046 --> 59:09.447
But my friends call me Trapper

59:09.449 --> 59:11.247
on the account of
my hunting skills.

59:11.249 --> 59:15.052
I, uh, catch small
upland game for meat.

59:15.054 --> 59:18.088
- I'm Ben Zagowski.
- Adopted?

59:18.090 --> 59:20.390
No, I don't think so.

59:20.392 --> 59:23.027
- Zagger, people call me Zagger.
- I know.

59:23.029 --> 59:25.564
You've become quite the
legend this season, congrats.

59:25.566 --> 59:28.669
- Thanks.
- Welcome to the club.

59:29.703 --> 59:31.339
Dusty Watkins.

59:32.638 --> 59:34.439
I remember you.

59:34.441 --> 59:36.074
You're that kid from De Pere

59:36.076 --> 59:37.775
that went missing
for a little while.

59:37.777 --> 59:40.411
You squatted in Lambeau for
the entire '95 season.

59:40.413 --> 59:43.748
And I remained unseen till
the conference championship.

59:43.750 --> 59:46.586
What? We lost to
Dallas that game.

59:46.588 --> 59:48.720
Yeah, because they caught
me and they kicked me out.

59:48.722 --> 59:50.289
That was a big mistake.

59:50.291 --> 59:51.758
They screwed that team
over when they did that.

59:51.760 --> 59:54.659
Oh, my god. You, man.

59:54.661 --> 59:57.162
That's when it all, like,
fell apart for you.

59:57.164 --> 01:00:00.532
Fell apart for me? What
are you talking about?

01:00:00.534 --> 01:00:04.804
I'm living the dream. I got no
ties, I got so significant other

01:00:04.806 --> 01:00:07.472
holding me back. I got
no responsibilities,

01:00:07.474 --> 01:00:10.211
other than my daughter.

01:00:12.180 --> 01:00:15.281
- She's a stick-figure.
- Yeah.

01:00:15.283 --> 01:00:19.520
I drew it. Shut up!

01:00:19.522 --> 01:00:21.687
I mean, I am leading my
life in the one direction

01:00:21.689 --> 01:00:23.723
that truly matters
in this world,

01:00:23.725 --> 01:00:26.225
following the Green Bay, whoa!

01:00:26.227 --> 01:00:30.497
Hot squirrel. Wanna
go halfsies on this?

01:00:30.499 --> 01:00:31.499
Yes.

01:00:32.501 --> 01:00:34.802
I'll cut it with my sword.

01:00:34.804 --> 01:00:37.672
- And not your ka-knife.
- What's that mean?

01:00:37.674 --> 01:00:40.375
Ka-knife, like the, 'cause we
were doing the sword thing,

01:00:40.377 --> 01:00:43.547
- so why not ka-knife?
- Knife.

01:00:45.181 --> 01:00:46.250
Yep.

01:01:00.765 --> 01:01:03.665
I'm living the dream. Living
the dream, living the dream.

01:01:03.667 --> 01:01:06.167
I got no significant
other holding me back.

01:01:06.169 --> 01:01:08.236
No significant other,
no significant other.

01:01:08.238 --> 01:01:11.473
Whoa, hot squirrel. Hot
squirrel, hot squirrel.

01:01:20.785 --> 01:01:22.886
Yeah!

01:01:22.888 --> 01:01:25.221
No!

01:01:25.223 --> 01:01:27.724
- Hey, buddy!
- Ben!

01:01:27.726 --> 01:01:29.458
Did you...

01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:33.130
Did you find a coffee
table to Farley?

01:01:33.132 --> 01:01:34.598
We were gonna tell you.

01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:35.898
We were just waiting
for the right moment.

01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:38.367
Yes.

01:01:38.369 --> 01:01:41.904
- Which is now.
- Which is now. It's now.

01:01:41.906 --> 01:01:44.474
Bud, she was helping me
through the divorce.

01:01:44.476 --> 01:01:46.676
And by that, I mean
she caused it.

01:01:46.678 --> 01:01:49.180
That is not true.

01:01:49.182 --> 01:01:50.280
Yeah, that's a little true.

01:01:51.416 --> 01:01:52.517
Look, I know little sisters

01:01:52.519 --> 01:01:53.651
are off-limits to
best friends...

01:01:53.653 --> 01:01:55.185
Ben, deal with it.

01:01:55.187 --> 01:01:56.687
Love is chemical.

01:01:56.689 --> 01:01:59.923
You can't control it,
and we're in love.

01:01:59.925 --> 01:02:04.130
- We're in love?
- We're in love.

01:02:07.166 --> 01:02:10.571
We're in love.

01:02:14.741 --> 01:02:17.678
We're gonna give you a minute.

01:02:51.713 --> 01:02:53.282
Booyah!

01:02:55.717 --> 01:02:56.919
Boo what?

01:02:58.386 --> 01:03:00.524
Booyah, Stuart Scott.

01:03:02.424 --> 01:03:03.459
Super.

01:03:04.359 --> 01:03:05.692
Bowl?

01:03:05.694 --> 01:03:08.661
No, not yet. It's
just the play-offs.

01:03:08.663 --> 01:03:10.931
No, I mean, do you
want to use the bowl?

01:03:10.933 --> 01:03:13.399
'Cause putting your hands
in the bag like that,

01:03:13.401 --> 01:03:17.270
- it's a little unsanitary.
- No, I'm good.

01:03:17.272 --> 01:03:20.241
You know you really have a
lot of women studies stuff.

01:03:20.243 --> 01:03:24.278
Uh, yeah. I wouldn't really
call it stuff, you know?

01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:26.947
It's more like
pieces of history.

01:03:26.949 --> 01:03:28.983
Yeah, I guess I'm
into women's studies

01:03:28.985 --> 01:03:33.021
like some people are
into ironic belt buckles

01:03:33.023 --> 01:03:35.657
or Lego movies.

01:03:35.659 --> 01:03:36.858
Blitz him, you idiots!

01:03:36.860 --> 01:03:38.025
You sound a lot like my

01:03:38.027 --> 01:03:41.398
auto mechanic, Gary DeSenzo.

01:03:42.766 --> 01:03:46.768
Hey, you remember
how we talked about

01:03:46.770 --> 01:03:48.870
maybe you posing today for me

01:03:48.872 --> 01:03:51.439
so that I can finish
that Jackie O painting?

01:03:51.441 --> 01:03:55.680
Right, that was before
we made the play-offs.

01:03:57.381 --> 01:03:59.314
Okay, I'll tell you what.

01:03:59.316 --> 01:04:01.049
I'm gonna go ahead and
I'm gonna get set-up,

01:04:01.051 --> 01:04:05.654
and then you can just come in
and join me whenever you're...

01:04:05.656 --> 01:04:09.759
- Oh!
- Done with this stuff.

01:04:09.761 --> 01:04:11.327
Oh, my gosh.

01:04:11.329 --> 01:04:13.563
- Okay.
- Oh, god.

01:04:13.565 --> 01:04:14.800
All right.

01:04:16.402 --> 01:04:17.668
Oh, oh!

01:04:20.873 --> 01:04:22.342
What?

01:04:26.844 --> 01:04:28.280
Game's on.

01:04:30.315 --> 01:04:34.754
What, are you gonna listen
to it on the radio, FDR?

01:04:36.689 --> 01:04:38.656
Well, don't forget
to bring your horse

01:04:38.658 --> 01:04:42.396
to the blacksmith's
to get it re-shoed.

01:04:47.834 --> 01:04:50.368
This was the first time Zagger

01:04:50.370 --> 01:04:53.437
didn't watch the
game from Fart Starr

01:04:53.439 --> 01:04:57.877
with his stats binder or
with any of his teammates.

01:05:17.130 --> 01:05:20.766
Like a roaring river
after a hard rain,

01:05:20.768 --> 01:05:24.637
Zagger passionately rushed
through the neighborhoods.

01:05:24.639 --> 01:05:28.575
He ran for 2.5 miles that day,

01:05:28.577 --> 01:05:32.448
something he hadn't done
in over 10 seasons.

01:05:33.948 --> 01:05:37.617
But that was the only stat
he would get to record,

01:05:37.619 --> 01:05:40.653
for the game came
to a conclusion

01:05:40.655 --> 01:05:43.522
upon arriving at
his destination.

01:05:43.524 --> 01:05:46.159
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

01:05:46.161 --> 01:05:51.400
Woo-hoo! Oh, my gosh. Yes, yes.

01:05:53.902 --> 01:05:55.136
Here comes the blitz.

01:05:55.138 --> 01:05:56.703
Rogers is hit, the ball is out.

01:05:56.705 --> 01:05:59.473
Dansby's got it.
The 10, the five.

01:05:59.475 --> 01:06:00.840
Touchdown.

01:06:00.842 --> 01:06:03.710
The Arizona Cardinals
win in the OT.

01:06:03.712 --> 01:06:07.181
What a heartbreaking
loss for Green Bay

01:06:07.183 --> 01:06:09.817
as their season comes to an end.

01:06:16.959 --> 01:06:19.693
That's it. Look at that.

01:06:19.695 --> 01:06:22.696
Oh, my god, that's amazing.

01:06:22.698 --> 01:06:24.966
Good job. Good job.

01:06:24.968 --> 01:06:27.905
That's it. Keep it steady.

01:06:35.946 --> 01:06:39.848
Yeah, so, um, when
you didn't come in,

01:06:39.850 --> 01:06:42.387
I kinda had to improvise.

01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:46.524
- Okay.
- Yeah.

01:06:47.991 --> 01:06:52.127
I guess now would be a
good time to tell you

01:06:52.129 --> 01:06:56.768
that I applied for the director
of operations in San Fran.

01:06:58.503 --> 01:07:02.805
There's good scuba in San Fran.

01:07:02.807 --> 01:07:07.577
Well I must say, as a
man, I am disappointed,

01:07:07.579 --> 01:07:13.152
but I must respect your
decision as a woman.

01:07:14.753 --> 01:07:17.720
I mean not as a woman.
I am not a woman.

01:07:17.722 --> 01:07:22.125
I mean your decision as
the woman that you are.

01:07:22.127 --> 01:07:26.767
Once again, Amy found
herself in free agency.

01:07:29.736 --> 01:07:31.803
She went into the off season

01:07:31.805 --> 01:07:35.205
picking up the pieces
of her past life

01:07:35.207 --> 01:07:37.644
with hopes of moving on.

01:07:47.288 --> 01:07:48.690
You okay?

01:07:50.224 --> 01:07:52.257
I can't believe it. It's over.

01:07:52.259 --> 01:07:55.528
It's really over.

01:07:55.530 --> 01:07:57.232
Tough loss, man.

01:07:59.634 --> 01:08:01.833
If you need someone to
talk to about it, or...

01:08:01.835 --> 01:08:03.769
What are you talking about?

01:08:03.771 --> 01:08:06.170
Well, that sucked.

01:08:06.172 --> 01:08:08.307
The game. The Pack lost.

01:08:08.309 --> 01:08:10.042
What are you talking about?

01:08:10.044 --> 01:08:13.113
- You okay, lover?
- I'm not your lover, okay?

01:08:13.115 --> 01:08:15.115
You took it upon yourself
to become a latch-key kid

01:08:15.117 --> 01:08:17.183
and hang out here all the
time, and why I let you,

01:08:17.185 --> 01:08:20.185
I don't know why, because
you're The Gong Show.

01:08:20.188 --> 01:08:22.055
- The Gong Show?
- Yeah, you're The Gong Show.

01:08:22.057 --> 01:08:23.923
We call you The Gong
Show because everybody

01:08:23.925 --> 01:08:27.562
just wants to bang you
and then kick you out.

01:08:29.831 --> 01:08:32.966
Well, isn't that typical?

01:08:32.968 --> 01:08:35.335
Boys get to have as
much fun as they want,

01:08:35.337 --> 01:08:41.545
but as soon as a girl joins
in, she's The Gong Show.

01:08:42.612 --> 01:08:45.345
I never heard you complain.

01:08:45.348 --> 01:08:48.715
Maybe that's because I
brought the party here.

01:08:48.716 --> 01:08:50.850
I made this place.

01:08:50.853 --> 01:08:53.154
- We made this place.
- I made this place.

01:08:53.156 --> 01:08:57.223
- Me. I did.
- You're the kid with the pool.

01:08:57.225 --> 01:09:01.832
This place is the pool, but
people don't actually like you.

01:09:03.633 --> 01:09:05.703
And you know what else?

01:09:06.837 --> 01:09:09.841
I don't actually
like you either.

01:09:12.676 --> 01:09:14.375
- You made this place?
- Don't start with me,

01:09:14.377 --> 01:09:16.377
all right? This whole time
you've been pushing me

01:09:16.379 --> 01:09:18.679
to do all this and lead the
single life along with you,

01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:20.616
and the whole time you were
banging my little sister.

01:09:20.618 --> 01:09:22.350
That's fantastic.

01:09:22.353 --> 01:09:24.953
You know, I'm tired of your
little ironic handlebar mustache

01:09:24.955 --> 01:09:28.358
and your little oh, I'm always
on face, I'm so funny face.

01:09:28.359 --> 01:09:30.158
Well, you know what?
You're not funny.

01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:32.394
Even Tauscher says that
your jokes, they suck.

01:09:32.395 --> 01:09:34.397
- Taush Mahal wouldn't say that.
- That's a terrible nickname.

01:09:34.399 --> 01:09:36.399
Just why don't you
get out, okay?

01:09:36.401 --> 01:09:39.769
And just take your stupid Bears
stuff and get out of here.

01:09:39.770 --> 01:09:41.304
You live in Green Bay, dumbass.

01:09:41.305 --> 01:09:43.272
How many championships
have the Bears won again?

01:09:43.274 --> 01:09:44.974
- Huh?
- Take it easy, Zagger.

01:09:44.975 --> 01:09:46.310
No, I'm not taking
it easy Zagger.

01:09:46.312 --> 01:09:47.645
That's what, take
it easy, Zagger.

01:09:47.647 --> 01:09:49.879
Get out. Go on, go.

01:09:49.881 --> 01:09:51.782
Come on, get out of my house.

01:09:51.783 --> 01:09:53.182
- Get out of my house.
- I'm not...

01:09:53.184 --> 01:09:54.385
What, you wanna go?
You wanna go?

01:09:54.387 --> 01:09:55.718
- Huh?
- I don't want to go.

01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:56.886
- You wanna go?
- No.

01:09:56.888 --> 01:09:58.422
- You wanna go?
- I don't.

01:09:58.424 --> 01:09:59.989
- Then let's go.
- I don't want to g...

01:09:59.991 --> 01:10:02.325
- I don't want to go.
- You wanna go?

01:10:02.327 --> 01:10:06.932
You toothed my nipple!

01:10:12.272 --> 01:10:14.609
You wanted me to leave!
Let me go!

01:10:16.777 --> 01:10:17.979
Get off me!

01:10:23.116 --> 01:10:24.618
Zagger, stop.

01:10:29.355 --> 01:10:31.157
Hold on, hold on.

01:10:48.176 --> 01:10:49.244
Stop!

01:10:51.011 --> 01:10:52.079
Don't!

01:10:58.854 --> 01:11:00.252
Don't!

01:11:00.254 --> 01:11:01.324
Stop!

01:11:15.104 --> 01:11:17.002
When a team is winning,

01:11:17.004 --> 01:11:20.107
everyone shares in the glory.

01:11:20.109 --> 01:11:25.480
It's during failure that
teammates start to assign blame.

01:11:25.482 --> 01:11:28.315
Zagger and Polano
found themselves

01:11:28.317 --> 01:11:30.917
in the bitter cold of defeat,

01:11:30.919 --> 01:11:36.323
and refused to
forfeit their pride.

01:11:36.325 --> 01:11:40.795
Clearly, neither one was
particularly good at fighting,

01:11:40.797 --> 01:11:43.331
nor in good physical condition,

01:11:43.333 --> 01:11:46.400
and for the first time
in their friendship,

01:11:46.402 --> 01:11:52.207
these teammates found
themselves demanding a trade.

01:11:52.209 --> 01:11:57.812
And for the record, I
don't bang your sister.

01:11:57.814 --> 01:12:00.719
I passionately bang your sister.

01:12:04.220 --> 01:12:07.991
Have fun being all
alone at your house.

01:12:12.264 --> 01:12:14.166
I don't need you.

01:12:17.402 --> 01:12:19.835
I don't need anybody.

01:12:19.837 --> 01:12:22.071
All I need is The Sixty,

01:12:22.073 --> 01:12:23.375
and The Pack,

01:12:25.342 --> 01:12:26.479
and beer!

01:12:27.378 --> 01:12:28.881
I'm a legend!

01:12:29.980 --> 01:12:33.318
I don't need anybody!

01:12:40.493 --> 01:12:44.327
Kuhn, I have to apologize.
That loss was my fault.

01:12:44.329 --> 01:12:46.429
I didn't write down
any of your stats,

01:12:46.431 --> 01:12:50.401
I didn't sit in Fart Starr, I
didn't even watch the game,

01:12:50.403 --> 01:12:53.036
so it's my fault,
give me a call.

01:12:53.038 --> 01:12:54.572
Come over, you
know, let's drink,

01:12:54.574 --> 01:12:57.441
let's chat chemistry,
solvents, whatever.

01:12:57.443 --> 01:12:59.109
Polano, my bad, dog.

01:12:59.111 --> 01:13:02.479
I, uh, I'm sorry I
toothed your nipple.

01:13:02.481 --> 01:13:07.185
That's my bad, but just call
me, come over, let's drink.

01:13:07.187 --> 01:13:12.424
Debbie, pick up your phone. Call
me, come over, let's drink.

01:13:12.426 --> 01:13:14.861
Gong... Vanessa.

01:13:16.195 --> 01:13:18.863
Hey, Mr. Severson,
uh, how are you?

01:13:18.865 --> 01:13:22.968
This is, uh, Ben Zagowski
from your senior year,

01:13:22.970 --> 01:13:25.370
from senior AP English.

01:13:25.372 --> 01:13:28.544
Yeah, I was... You
wanna come up...

01:13:30.178 --> 01:13:33.346
May I please have you
come over and drink?

01:13:43.924 --> 01:13:46.026
We'll bounce back. We always do.

01:13:46.028 --> 01:13:47.463
Titletown, baby.

01:13:51.367 --> 01:13:54.270
I know what you need, my friend.

01:13:56.171 --> 01:14:00.908
I made it myself. This right
here I call Lambrew Field.

01:14:00.910 --> 01:14:01.944
Try it.

01:14:04.446 --> 01:14:08.548
I'm gonna bottle and distribute
this stuff right here.

01:14:08.550 --> 01:14:11.219
You want in early?
You wanna invest?

01:14:11.221 --> 01:14:13.321
- I'll think about it.
- Think about it, all right.

01:14:13.323 --> 01:14:15.555
Well, think about it.

01:14:15.557 --> 01:14:19.896
Not really my, I don't
have any money at all.

01:14:26.202 --> 01:14:27.238
Whoa.

01:14:28.137 --> 01:14:29.504
What's happening?

01:14:29.506 --> 01:14:31.973
Oh, yeah.

01:14:31.975 --> 01:14:33.340
What's going on here?

01:14:33.342 --> 01:14:35.411
I double brewed this batch.

01:14:35.413 --> 01:14:38.380
See, the best way to deal with
a loss is to ignore reality.

01:14:38.382 --> 01:14:41.684
- Whoa.
- Yeah. I got a question.

01:14:41.686 --> 01:14:44.953
Have you seen a cow named Mitch?

01:14:44.955 --> 01:14:46.956
I see spider webs,
like, everywhere.

01:14:46.958 --> 01:14:50.425
Why is your daughter
staring at me?

01:14:50.427 --> 01:14:53.662
Where are all your
friends, Zagger?

01:14:53.664 --> 01:14:56.564
Oh, hm, what? I don't like this.

01:14:56.566 --> 01:14:58.336
Oh, make it stop.

01:15:00.438 --> 01:15:03.306
Come on, make this stop.

01:15:03.308 --> 01:15:05.074
Hot water'll make it stop.

01:15:05.076 --> 01:15:08.278
Make hot water. Make it stop.

01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:11.748
Oh, the noise will make it stop.

01:15:11.750 --> 01:15:15.017
Is that mine? Is that my hand?

01:15:15.019 --> 01:15:18.454
The noise will make it stop.

01:15:18.456 --> 01:15:21.093
This suit'll make it stop.

01:15:23.028 --> 01:15:24.462
- This isn't me, man. This isn't...
- Well, you know what?

01:15:24.464 --> 01:15:28.132
Take a couple more
sips and it'll stop.

01:15:28.134 --> 01:15:30.266
Oh, my stat's will make it stop.

01:15:30.268 --> 01:15:32.168
I was joking. It's
not gonna stop.

01:15:32.170 --> 01:15:33.539
It prolongs it.

01:15:36.709 --> 01:15:38.178
I'm hungry.

01:15:43.282 --> 01:15:45.016
You must be Mitch.

01:15:45.018 --> 01:15:47.686
Classic cow-man story.

01:15:47.688 --> 01:15:52.424
You don't win once in a while,
you win all of the time.

01:15:52.426 --> 01:15:54.192
You don't do things
right once in a while,

01:15:54.194 --> 01:15:56.594
you do things right
all the time.

01:15:56.596 --> 01:16:02.633
Winning is a habit.
Unfortunately, so is losing.

01:16:02.635 --> 01:16:05.403
It's so nice that daddy
finally has a friend

01:16:05.405 --> 01:16:07.239
to watch the games with us.

01:16:07.241 --> 01:16:11.176
Forever and ever and ever.

01:16:19.053 --> 01:16:20.085
Is that gas?

01:16:23.624 --> 01:16:24.756
Gas!

01:16:24.758 --> 01:16:27.059
That's gas! Everybody out!

01:16:35.504 --> 01:16:37.203
Mitch?

01:16:37.205 --> 01:16:39.573
Mitch, run! It's gonna blow up!

01:16:39.575 --> 01:16:42.341
Run! Run! Go!

01:16:42.343 --> 01:16:45.311
Go! Yes, good.

01:16:45.313 --> 01:16:46.782
Faster!

01:16:58.260 --> 01:16:59.593
Oh!

01:16:59.595 --> 01:17:00.595
Trapper!

01:18:06.431 --> 01:18:08.497
Left alone with the
charred stench

01:18:08.499 --> 01:18:12.202
of reckless decisions,
Zagger couldn't help

01:18:12.204 --> 01:18:16.142
but long for Verbena Lemongrass.

01:18:18.410 --> 01:18:21.479
Upon evaluating his
own situation,

01:18:21.481 --> 01:18:25.882
Zagger realized he was in
need of essential changes

01:18:25.884 --> 01:18:29.189
to ensure success
for the future.

01:18:31.723 --> 01:18:36.627
Amy, too, decided it was time
for a change with a new city,

01:18:36.629 --> 01:18:40.767
a new stadium, and good scuba.

01:20:01.918 --> 01:20:04.318
As the old proverb goes,

01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:08.523
blood is thicker than water,
meaning relationships

01:20:08.525 --> 01:20:12.528
and loyalties within a
family are the strongest.

01:20:12.530 --> 01:20:14.930
I grew up back east, but my
father and my grandfather

01:20:14.932 --> 01:20:16.564
grew up in Milwaukee, Wisconsin,

01:20:16.566 --> 01:20:19.335
so before I could walk, I
was in green and gold.

01:20:19.337 --> 01:20:21.604
I would listen to the games
with my dad on the radio,

01:20:21.606 --> 01:20:25.808
so I'm a die-hard Packer
fan no matter what.

01:20:25.810 --> 01:20:27.609
When you're knocked down,

01:20:27.611 --> 01:20:31.346
you can always count on
family to pick you up.

01:20:31.348 --> 01:20:33.082
You know, for The
Packers, for me,

01:20:33.084 --> 01:20:34.551
it reminds me a lot of what I
had with my dad and grandpa

01:20:34.553 --> 01:20:36.052
before they passed away.

01:20:36.054 --> 01:20:37.788
We always got to watch games
at my grandpa's house.

01:20:37.790 --> 01:20:39.623
My dad and I would
drive down there.

01:20:39.625 --> 01:20:42.458
It was truthfully like,
the best part for me

01:20:42.460 --> 01:20:43.994
and why I like The
Packers so much.

01:20:43.996 --> 01:20:45.796
And that is exactly

01:20:45.798 --> 01:20:50.534
what John and Linda
Zagowski did for their son.

01:20:50.536 --> 01:20:52.769
Ben, I need you to
get me that estimate

01:20:52.771 --> 01:20:55.872
on the boom lift for SPS
Roofing in Appleton.

01:20:55.874 --> 01:20:58.345
Already done.

01:21:01.381 --> 01:21:04.548
And also, I took a look at
thermite welds versus apparatus.

01:21:04.550 --> 01:21:07.485
We might be able to save a
little by switching over.

01:21:07.487 --> 01:21:09.786
And also, I think a lot
of jobs might benefit

01:21:09.788 --> 01:21:12.656
from flux core versus MIG.

01:21:12.658 --> 01:21:15.392
I think we're looking
at about 2% savings

01:21:15.394 --> 01:21:19.931
with about 9/10 relief
on labor costs.

01:21:19.933 --> 01:21:23.369
Makes perfect sense to me.

01:21:23.371 --> 01:21:26.905
Okay, well, uh, we'll,
we'll look into it.

01:21:26.907 --> 01:21:28.674
Oh, uh, honey, there's
some cheese curds

01:21:28.676 --> 01:21:30.108
in the refrigerator for ya.

01:21:30.110 --> 01:21:32.745
I'll grab 'em later, Ma.

01:21:32.747 --> 01:21:34.649
Zagowski's Welding.

01:21:52.601 --> 01:21:53.703
Hey, bro.

01:21:55.169 --> 01:21:57.136
Mind if I come in?

01:21:57.138 --> 01:21:58.873
Mind if you take off your shoes?

01:22:19.562 --> 01:22:21.796
You look good. Did
you get a haircut?

01:22:21.798 --> 01:22:24.198
No. I washed it.

01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:25.469
Oh.

01:22:31.674 --> 01:22:33.111
I've missed you.

01:22:35.978 --> 01:22:38.980
- Polano's missed you.
- Yeah.

01:22:38.982 --> 01:22:43.918
You two, you're still dating?

01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:45.155
We're engaged.

01:22:47.890 --> 01:22:50.659
Hey, congrats. That's awesome.

01:22:50.661 --> 01:22:51.927
He better shape up
and treat you right

01:22:51.929 --> 01:22:53.727
or I will take a wedge of Gouda

01:22:53.729 --> 01:22:55.963
and hit him right in the junk.

01:22:55.965 --> 01:22:58.469
No. We want kids.

01:23:01.672 --> 01:23:03.705
Oh, you should come to
his show this weekend.

01:23:03.707 --> 01:23:05.607
Yeah. Yeah, maybe.

01:23:05.609 --> 01:23:07.210
Maybe, maybe, maybe.

01:23:07.212 --> 01:23:09.579
I don't know, I got work.

01:23:09.581 --> 01:23:11.179
How is it working for the folks?

01:23:11.181 --> 01:23:14.116
You know, I don't know. Weird.

01:23:14.118 --> 01:23:16.619
You know, kinda like I'm
still in high school,

01:23:16.621 --> 01:23:18.086
except minus all the acne.

01:23:18.088 --> 01:23:19.789
Oh wait, you still got acne.

01:23:19.791 --> 01:23:21.828
Yeah, I know. Whatever.

01:23:25.864 --> 01:23:30.536
Well, it looks like you have
everything under control.

01:23:31.102 --> 01:23:32.172
Yep.

01:23:43.147 --> 01:23:45.986
Don't be a stranger.

01:23:47.687 --> 01:23:51.459
I'm really happy for
you, little sis.

01:23:53.927 --> 01:23:55.996
I'm happy for you both.

01:23:57.129 --> 01:23:58.565
Thank you.

01:24:01.300 --> 01:24:02.966
You should call her.

01:24:02.968 --> 01:24:05.203
What's the point?
She's in San Fran.

01:24:05.205 --> 01:24:06.970
It's gone, she's gone.

01:24:06.972 --> 01:24:08.773
I mean, it wouldn't be so
bad routing for the 49s,

01:24:08.775 --> 01:24:10.174
now would it?

01:24:10.176 --> 01:24:11.677
- I heard it.
- Did you?

01:24:11.679 --> 01:24:12.912
I threw up a little bit.

01:24:12.914 --> 01:24:14.713
Yeah, I'm holding mine down.

01:24:14.715 --> 01:24:15.580
Don't tell anyone I said that.

01:24:15.582 --> 01:24:17.018
I won't.

01:24:19.687 --> 01:24:21.022
Bye.

01:24:25.625 --> 01:24:28.127
So I wish I was a
student in 1776.

01:24:28.129 --> 01:24:29.328
You know, your
father will let you

01:24:29.330 --> 01:24:31.329
take the new horse to school.

01:24:31.331 --> 01:24:32.965
You're in your log cabin school

01:24:32.967 --> 01:24:36.201
and you're sitting down
for the big final exam.

01:24:36.203 --> 01:24:38.672
First question, what
major American event

01:24:38.674 --> 01:24:39.806
happened this past summer?

01:24:42.610 --> 01:24:44.177
End of test. That's it.

01:24:44.179 --> 01:24:47.947
That's the test. On to
farming class, kids.

01:24:47.949 --> 01:24:51.718
All right, that's my time.
I'm Polano.

01:24:57.659 --> 01:24:59.727
- Dude, hey!
- That was hilarious!

01:24:59.729 --> 01:25:00.995
Dude, thanks for
coming out, man.

01:25:00.997 --> 01:25:02.897
Man, you're good!

01:25:02.899 --> 01:25:04.365
I'm getting better, you know,
I'm just doin' what I love.

01:25:04.367 --> 01:25:06.666
Awesome, man! Yeah, congrats!

01:25:06.668 --> 01:25:10.271
- Good for you!
- Thanks, thank you.

01:25:10.273 --> 01:25:12.106
- So...
- Yeah.

01:25:12.108 --> 01:25:13.142
Uh...

01:25:15.011 --> 01:25:17.745
- Dude, I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

01:25:17.747 --> 01:25:20.747
I'm sorry. Let me do
the feelings stuff.

01:25:20.749 --> 01:25:22.818
You were there for me at
the house all the time.

01:25:22.820 --> 01:25:25.687
You were on my side
and I was like

01:25:25.689 --> 01:25:27.055
and I got selfish.

01:25:27.057 --> 01:25:29.160
- I'm sorry.
- It's cool.

01:25:30.860 --> 01:25:32.693
How's it going, guys?
Whoop, hey, look at that.

01:25:32.695 --> 01:25:36.698
Gay marriage just got legalized
in Wisconsin over here.

01:25:36.700 --> 01:25:38.300
If anyone wants, they're
registered over at,

01:25:38.302 --> 01:25:39.967
uh, Bed, Bath and Beyonce.

01:25:42.306 --> 01:25:43.971
He's good.

01:25:43.973 --> 01:25:45.009
It's good to be here.

01:25:49.781 --> 01:25:52.414
Creepy. What are you doing?

01:25:52.416 --> 01:25:54.783
Ben, you're fired.

01:25:54.785 --> 01:25:56.918
Is this because of the
incident in the bathroom?

01:25:56.920 --> 01:25:58.988
Because if you don't
want that to happen,

01:25:58.990 --> 01:26:00.890
then don't put those
magazines in there.

01:26:00.892 --> 01:26:02.891
I clicked on some stuff
on that internet,

01:26:02.893 --> 01:26:05.194
and there is a shipment
manager position

01:26:05.196 --> 01:26:07.130
at The Packers'
office available,

01:26:07.132 --> 01:26:09.298
and you have an interview
in 20 minutes.

01:26:09.300 --> 01:26:12.302
No, Ma. Not another
stupid shipping position.

01:26:12.304 --> 01:26:16.807
- I called an audible.
- We love you, Benny.

01:26:16.809 --> 01:26:18.011
Go get 'em.

01:26:25.384 --> 01:26:28.118
- I'll see what happens.
- You'll be fine.

01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:29.189
Smile.

01:26:31.223 --> 01:26:32.991
What magazines?

01:26:32.993 --> 01:26:35.293
With every ounce of his being,

01:26:35.295 --> 01:26:39.731
Zagger did not want to
be a shipping boy again,

01:26:39.733 --> 01:26:42.834
but the possibility
of being inside

01:26:42.836 --> 01:26:46.271
these hallowed halls
intrigued him.

01:26:46.273 --> 01:26:52.313
Zagger swallowed his pride and
grappled with his self-doubt.

01:26:53.012 --> 01:26:54.845
Hi.

01:26:54.847 --> 01:26:56.747
I'm here for a job interview.

01:26:56.749 --> 01:26:58.783
I must be in the wrong place.

01:26:58.785 --> 01:27:01.222
No, I'm here for one too.

01:27:12.467 --> 01:27:14.500
I hate interviews.

01:27:14.502 --> 01:27:16.437
They make me nervous.

01:27:17.472 --> 01:27:18.903
What job are you here for?

01:27:18.905 --> 01:27:20.940
Uh, shipping buh...

01:27:20.942 --> 01:27:22.744
Shipping manager.

01:27:24.780 --> 01:27:28.117
That's the same
job I'm here for.

01:27:29.884 --> 01:27:32.284
I'm just messing with you man.
I'm Chuck.

01:27:32.286 --> 01:27:34.386
Oh, I know who you are. Yeah.

01:27:34.388 --> 01:27:36.055
Yeah, oh my god. You got me.

01:27:36.057 --> 01:27:38.859
Put a little dime spot
in my pants there.

01:27:38.861 --> 01:27:40.527
So, are you here to...

01:27:40.529 --> 01:27:42.194
I'm here to talk about
training some of the players.

01:27:42.196 --> 01:27:43.796
Strength and conditioning,

01:27:43.798 --> 01:27:45.232
killer instinct mindset
sort of thing.

01:27:45.234 --> 01:27:47.267
I got paid a lot of money
to do what I love,

01:27:47.269 --> 01:27:49.803
legally almost killing people,

01:27:49.805 --> 01:27:52.006
and now I'm retired, and
I wanna be involved

01:27:52.008 --> 01:27:54.342
with something else
I love, The Pack.

01:27:54.344 --> 01:27:58.012
I'll do anything to be
part of this organization.

01:27:58.014 --> 01:27:59.780
Right.

01:27:59.782 --> 01:28:02.216
Ben Zagowski, we're
ready for you now,

01:28:02.218 --> 01:28:04.452
and then Charles Little,
you'll be after him.

01:28:04.454 --> 01:28:07.521
Charles Liddell. Chuck Liddell?

01:28:07.523 --> 01:28:10.459
- Chuck Liddell.
- Oh. Okay.

01:28:10.461 --> 01:28:13.861
- Ben, do you want a water?
- So...

01:28:13.863 --> 01:28:17.833
Basically you'll be
shipping packages.

01:28:17.835 --> 01:28:20.835
I just had to make sure that
you weren't a complete moron,

01:28:20.837 --> 01:28:25.339
but you're not, so you got the job.
Yay.

01:28:25.341 --> 01:28:28.944
- Great, thank you.
- Can I get you some tea?

01:28:28.946 --> 01:28:30.279
No, I'm good on tea, thank you.

01:28:30.281 --> 01:28:32.181
- Hey!
- Hey.

01:28:32.183 --> 01:28:34.850
Nice! Lucky buckey
badger went over to you.

01:28:34.852 --> 01:28:38.287
Damn straight! Yeah,
champs bowl champs.

01:28:38.289 --> 01:28:40.055
Pop, are you a pop guy?

01:28:40.057 --> 01:28:41.991
I mean I am, but I'm good on pop.
Thank you.

01:28:41.993 --> 01:28:44.527
- Hey, Zagger, what's up, buddy?
- What's up, Mike?

01:28:44.529 --> 01:28:47.831
Wow. Is he, uh,
working with us now?

01:28:47.833 --> 01:28:50.299
Yeah. He's the new
shipping manager.

01:28:50.301 --> 01:28:52.602
Yeah, shipping manager's
got knowledge.

01:28:52.604 --> 01:28:56.139
Anyway, congratulations on
your all's sorry-ass badgers.

01:28:56.141 --> 01:28:58.442
Yeah, well, you owe
me a steak dinner.

01:28:58.444 --> 01:29:00.610
Bowl went over to
you, that's huge.

01:29:00.612 --> 01:29:02.846
I mean, it's gonna be tough
to replace Schofield, though.

01:29:02.848 --> 01:29:04.547
Milk? Can I get you some milk?

01:29:04.549 --> 01:29:06.449
I ran some numbers on him.

01:29:06.451 --> 01:29:10.119
His snap to sack speed is
2/10 of a second quicker

01:29:10.121 --> 01:29:12.323
than anybody else
in the conference.

01:29:12.325 --> 01:29:16.463
- No kidding?
- Told you. Mad knowledge.

01:29:17.896 --> 01:29:20.933
Who would you pick in the draft?

01:29:23.870 --> 01:29:25.105
Tight end.

01:29:26.607 --> 01:29:28.506
Receiving core here is solid,

01:29:28.508 --> 01:29:30.542
but it would be really
nice to have someone op

01:29:30.544 --> 01:29:34.448
check down in the flat
or over the middle.

01:29:37.617 --> 01:29:39.583
I would also go with
a running back.

01:29:39.585 --> 01:29:41.352
There's a kid out of
Buffalo that's had

01:29:41.354 --> 01:29:43.622
back to back 1,000 yard
seasons, 40 touchdowns.

01:29:43.624 --> 01:29:45.924
Plus kids out of
Buffalo in the draft

01:29:45.926 --> 01:29:47.660
always fly under the radar.

01:29:47.662 --> 01:29:49.527
You can pick him up late,
you can pick him up cheap.

01:29:49.529 --> 01:29:52.365
We were 14th in the lead
last year in rushing.

01:29:52.367 --> 01:29:54.200
That's ridiculous.

01:29:54.202 --> 01:29:57.203
My forecast, bare minimum,
we should be 5th or 4th.

01:29:57.205 --> 01:29:59.237
So you pair this
kid out of Buffalo

01:29:59.239 --> 01:30:01.307
with Brandon Jackson
in the backfield.

01:30:01.309 --> 01:30:03.174
You have Kuhn hitting his
assignments in the A gap,

01:30:03.176 --> 01:30:05.244
possibly running him
out into the B gap.

01:30:05.246 --> 01:30:08.083
We would have a sick backfield.

01:30:12.221 --> 01:30:15.121
It's just some thoughts.

01:30:15.123 --> 01:30:16.990
Jody, you know that
assistant scout

01:30:16.992 --> 01:30:20.093
who ends half his
sentences in just sayin'?

01:30:20.095 --> 01:30:22.361
Ugh. Gets all handsy at
the Christmas parties?

01:30:22.363 --> 01:30:24.330
- Curtiss.
- Curtiss, yeah.

01:30:24.332 --> 01:30:27.500
Curtiss. Two S's.

01:30:27.502 --> 01:30:28.537
Curtiss.

01:30:30.005 --> 01:30:32.004
Oh, I'm gonna fire him.

01:30:32.006 --> 01:30:33.640
Just sayin'.

01:30:33.642 --> 01:30:36.477
I got a great candidate
to replace him.

01:30:36.479 --> 01:30:39.279
Steak? That's it.
You're a food guy,

01:30:39.281 --> 01:30:40.514
- not a beverage guy.
- You want a steak?

01:30:40.516 --> 01:30:42.050
Yeah, you want a steak.

01:30:42.052 --> 01:30:43.283
- You want a steak, right?
- Yeah?

01:30:43.285 --> 01:30:45.118
- Sure.
- I knew it.

01:30:45.120 --> 01:30:46.621
Finally.

01:30:46.623 --> 01:30:48.523
But no, though, we
don't have any here.

01:30:48.525 --> 01:30:50.358
We don't have steak here.
We're a football team.

01:30:50.360 --> 01:30:53.161
Yeah, not a commercial kitchen.

01:30:53.163 --> 01:30:56.264
So to be clear, I'm
an assistant scout,

01:30:56.266 --> 01:30:59.568
- not shipping manager?
- Yeah.

01:30:59.570 --> 01:31:04.739
Zagger's passion had now
become his profession.

01:31:04.741 --> 01:31:11.747
He was no longer a shipping boy,
but an assistant scout man.

01:31:11.749 --> 01:31:16.985
If only Zagger's 10-year-old
self could see him now,

01:31:16.987 --> 01:31:21.290
he'd probably say, hm, I
thought I'd be taller,

01:31:21.292 --> 01:31:24.293
but that's a pretty
kick-ass job.

01:31:24.295 --> 01:31:27.432
Way to go, future self.

01:31:28.466 --> 01:31:30.299
Whether he knew it or not,

01:31:30.301 --> 01:31:34.236
Zagger had prepared for
this job his entire life,

01:31:34.238 --> 01:31:37.606
and everything was perfect.

01:31:37.608 --> 01:31:39.575
Almost everything.

01:31:53.760 --> 01:31:55.963
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:32:00.332 --> 01:32:03.233
- Big day.
- Yeah.

01:32:03.235 --> 01:32:06.771
Looks great. They're
so cute together.

01:32:06.773 --> 01:32:08.007
Yeah.

01:32:11.078 --> 01:32:13.444
Have you tried this?
It's really good.

01:32:13.446 --> 01:32:16.313
Yeah, I know. I
should have invested.

01:32:16.315 --> 01:32:19.084
So assistant scout
position, that's amazing.

01:32:19.086 --> 01:32:22.153
Yeah, yeah. It's unreal.
It is amazing.

01:32:22.155 --> 01:32:24.188
I'm really happy for you.

01:32:24.190 --> 01:32:25.559
You deserve it.

01:32:27.293 --> 01:32:31.398
- All your dreams came true.
- I guess.

01:32:32.801 --> 01:32:34.600
If the two of you
are done yapping,

01:32:34.602 --> 01:32:38.171
we'd like to get this
rehearsal started. 'Kay?

01:32:38.173 --> 01:32:39.337
Let's go.

01:32:41.642 --> 01:32:43.678
Excuse me, everybody.

01:32:44.445 --> 01:32:47.113
Excuse me.

01:32:47.115 --> 01:32:49.681
Before we start, I'd just
like to take this time

01:32:49.683 --> 01:32:54.220
to thank someone
special to me, to us.

01:32:54.222 --> 01:32:57.190
Growing up a Bears' fan
in Green Bay wasn't easy.

01:32:57.192 --> 01:32:59.493
Boo.

01:32:59.495 --> 01:33:02.762
It was kinda like being
Andy Dufresne in Shawshank,

01:33:02.764 --> 01:33:06.733
but a lot less murder.

01:33:06.735 --> 01:33:09.636
But I found my Morgan Freeman.

01:33:09.638 --> 01:33:12.271
My Red. Someone who had my back

01:33:12.273 --> 01:33:15.609
and who would smuggle in all
those chess pieces I wanted.

01:33:15.611 --> 01:33:17.377
How come he's the only one
who gets this reference?

01:33:17.379 --> 01:33:19.178
- Come on. Come on.
- Shawshank.

01:33:19.180 --> 01:33:20.682
- Shawshank Redemption?
- Tim Robbins.

01:33:20.684 --> 01:33:22.683
- Best Picture, '95?
- Yeah, I get it.

01:33:22.685 --> 01:33:26.120
- Anybody? All right.
- All right.

01:33:26.122 --> 01:33:27.157
Anyway.

01:33:27.858 --> 01:33:29.591
Thank you, Zagger.

01:33:29.593 --> 01:33:31.426
You've been a brother
my whole life,

01:33:31.428 --> 01:33:34.628
but tomorrow you're
officially family.

01:33:34.630 --> 01:33:36.396
- Salud.
- Salud.

01:33:36.398 --> 01:33:37.397
Salud, cheers.

01:33:37.399 --> 01:33:39.366
Okay, listen up!

01:33:39.368 --> 01:33:42.402
Polano, go up front.

01:33:42.404 --> 01:33:44.839
- The two of you, hey, hey, hey.
- Yes?

01:33:44.841 --> 01:33:46.909
Will you guys get
together already?

01:33:46.911 --> 01:33:48.443
- Yes.
- Here?

01:33:48.445 --> 01:33:50.579
Here, here, here, here?

01:33:50.581 --> 01:33:52.281
Oh, hot back, hot
back, hot back.

01:33:52.283 --> 01:33:53.616
I know, I've been meaning
to have a doctor

01:33:53.618 --> 01:33:55.351
- take a look at that, but...
- Guys!

01:33:55.353 --> 01:33:57.920
Quit fartin' around,
I'm getting married.

01:33:57.922 --> 01:34:01.490
Get together, okay?

01:34:01.492 --> 01:34:02.694
Lookin' good.

01:34:07.164 --> 01:34:10.367
- So how's San Fran?
- Great. Yeah.

01:34:10.369 --> 01:34:13.435
- I'm really gonna miss it.
- Miss it?

01:34:13.437 --> 01:34:17.273
They offered me the VP of
Operations for North America.

01:34:17.275 --> 01:34:19.111
And that means?

01:34:19.878 --> 01:34:22.148
I'll be moving back.

01:34:26.784 --> 01:34:28.253
Welcome home.

01:34:29.655 --> 01:34:33.256
Super fans have come and gone,

01:34:33.258 --> 01:34:37.461
but as long as these titans
battle on the gridiron,

01:34:37.463 --> 01:34:40.831
there will be fans
dedicating their lives

01:34:40.833 --> 01:34:43.234
to these gods of sport,

01:34:43.236 --> 01:34:46.404
blindly putting
relationships at risk.

01:34:46.406 --> 01:34:51.609
But in the end, one
must reflect and think,

01:34:51.611 --> 01:34:56.582
how did Zagger not
notice a fully grown cow

01:34:56.584 --> 01:34:58.249
living in his house?

01:34:58.251 --> 01:35:00.284
I mean, what the fuck?

01:35:26.448 --> 01:35:29.514
There's no other fan base
like The Packers' fan base.

01:35:29.516 --> 01:35:33.385
The fans, too. The fans are
the greatest of any team.

01:35:33.387 --> 01:35:35.388
You feel like you're
among friends

01:35:35.390 --> 01:35:37.423
- whenever you're at the game.
- We've started a family.

01:35:37.425 --> 01:35:40.727
I have people here today from
probably 10 different states.

01:35:40.729 --> 01:35:42.562
I'm originally from
Southern Wisconsin.

01:35:42.564 --> 01:35:44.264
I now live in Kentucky.

01:35:44.266 --> 01:35:46.666
I'm from Seattle, Washington,
born and raised there.

01:35:46.668 --> 01:35:47.934
We live in Oklahoma City area.

01:35:47.936 --> 01:35:49.670
I am not from Green Bay.

01:35:49.672 --> 01:35:51.839
I am from Kingston, Jamaica.

01:35:51.841 --> 01:35:53.540
And I'm at home here.

01:35:53.542 --> 01:35:56.576
Everyone's very nice,
accommodating, give me beer.

01:35:56.578 --> 01:35:58.645
We heard that the Packer
fans are the best fans.

01:35:58.647 --> 01:36:00.813
They're really nice
and accommodating.

01:36:00.815 --> 01:36:02.282
But we'll see.

01:36:02.284 --> 01:36:03.783
- Yeah, fans are great.
- So far.

01:36:03.785 --> 01:36:05.685
We'll see how much
alcohol they have.

01:36:05.687 --> 01:36:06.953
Yeah, we'll see how
long that lasts.

01:36:06.955 --> 01:36:08.959
Once the beer kicks in.

01:36:10.927 --> 01:36:15.329
Whoa! Where did you get
such a cannon for an arm?

01:36:15.331 --> 01:36:17.935
Guess it runs in the family.

01:36:23.706 --> 01:36:25.473
I think it's time
we had the talk.

01:36:25.475 --> 01:36:27.708
Dad, I'm about to
graduate college.

01:36:27.710 --> 01:36:29.943
It's a little late for that.

01:36:29.945 --> 01:36:32.614
No, the other talk.

01:36:40.758 --> 01:36:42.794
Son, you're adopted.

01:36:46.430 --> 01:36:48.029
For those difficult
moments in life,

01:36:48.031 --> 01:36:49.664
reach for a cool refreshing beer

01:36:49.666 --> 01:36:53.935
that helps smooth over
life's rough edges.

01:36:53.937 --> 01:36:55.471
Time out, boys.

01:37:33.480 --> 01:37:34.915
Fuck.

01:37:42.020 --> 01:37:45.023
Why did you guys wait
so long to tell me?

01:37:45.025 --> 01:37:47.893
Oh, sounds like someone
needs another Lambrew.

01:37:47.895 --> 01:37:49.560
Hey, make that two!

01:38:00.807 --> 01:38:05.012
Lambrew Field, take a
break from reality.

01:38:12.622 --> 01:38:14.250
