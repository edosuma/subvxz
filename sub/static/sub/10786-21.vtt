WEBVTT

02:01.583 --> 02:04.166
YOU KNOW, IF YOU
CAME HERE TO DISCUSS
ME AND PACEY,

02:04.166 --> 02:06.125
YOU'RE WASTING YOUR
BREATH BECAUSE--

02:06.125 --> 02:09.959
PACEY'S THE LAST  PERSON
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT,
TRUST ME.

02:09.959 --> 02:12.000
I CAME HERE
TO TALK ABOUT US.

02:13.041 --> 02:16.458
I--I WANT YOU IN MY LIFE.

02:20.417 --> 02:21.458
AND PACEY?

02:21.458 --> 02:23.041
THAT DAMAGE HAS BEEN DONE.
I CAME TO SALVAGE

02:23.041 --> 02:25.333
THE ONE RELATIONSHIP THAT
I NEED MORE THAN ANY OTHER,

02:25.333 --> 02:26.708
AND THAT'S OURS.

02:26.708 --> 02:28.542
HOW?

02:28.542 --> 02:30.750
LET'S REBUILD. LET'S...

02:30.750 --> 02:32.792
TAKE A WALK.
LET'S HAVE A PICNIC,

02:32.792 --> 02:34.125
WATCH A MOVIE.

02:34.125 --> 02:35.542
AFTER EVERYTHING
THAT'S HAPPENED,

02:35.542 --> 02:36.959
HOW COULD I POSSIBLY
CLIMB THAT LADDER
INTO YOUR BEDROOM

02:36.959 --> 02:39.083
AND WATCH A MOVIE?

02:39.083 --> 02:40.959
I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO DISREGARD
WHAT'S HAPPENED, JOEY.

02:40.959 --> 02:43.291
I'M SAYING LET'S MOVE FORWARD
FROM HERE.

02:46.625 --> 02:48.000
YOU KNOW WHAT?

02:50.375 --> 02:53.333
ALL I WANT TO DO
RIGHT NOW, DAWSON, IS--

02:53.333 --> 02:55.583
IS PAINT MY WALL.

02:57.625 --> 02:59.417
ALL RIGHT.

02:59.417 --> 03:04.542
WELL, IT'S A FREESTANDING
INVITATION.

03:04.542 --> 03:07.458
ANY TIME YOU WANT.

03:07.458 --> 03:09.542
YOU KNOW WHERE I LIVE.

04:15.708 --> 04:19.208
MRS. LEERY, YOU ARE LOOKING
PARTICULARLY LOVELY
THIS TOURIST SEASON.

04:19.208 --> 04:22.417
IS IT JUST MY IMAGINATION,
OR DID THIS YEAR GO BY
EVEN FASTER THAN THE LAST?

04:22.417 --> 04:25.458
EACH YEAR GETS
EXPONENTIALLY SHORTER.

04:25.458 --> 04:27.583
WHICH IS WHY
WE SHOULD BE MAKING
EACH DAY COUNT, RIGHT?

04:29.583 --> 04:31.708
GAIL, I--I CAN'T
BELIEVE--

04:31.708 --> 04:34.583
RELAX. WE MADE
THIS ARRANGEMENT
WITH PACEY WEEKS AGO.

04:34.583 --> 04:36.291
YEAH, BUT IN LIGHT
OF WHAT'S HAPPENED--

04:36.291 --> 04:38.125
IT'S JUST A BOAT RACE,

04:38.125 --> 04:40.250
ONE THAT WE COULD
VERY MUCH BENEFIT FROM.

04:40.250 --> 04:43.000
Mitch: I'M NOT SURE DAWSON
WILL SEE IT THAT WAY.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.166
SEE WHAT WHAT  WAY?

04:47.500 --> 04:49.291
WHAT'S THE FLAG?

04:49.291 --> 04:51.250
A MONTH AGO,
WE OFFERED
TO SPONSOR PACEY

04:51.250 --> 04:51.750
IN THE REGATTA,
HONEY.

04:51.750 --> 04:53.041
OH.

04:53.041 --> 04:54.041
WE NEEDED
PUBLICITY.

04:54.041 --> 04:56.417
HE WANTED
A SPONSOR.

04:56.417 --> 04:57.417
WE THOUGHT
THE TWO OF YOU

04:57.417 --> 04:58.458
WOULD BE DOING
IT TOGETHER,

04:58.458 --> 04:59.792
BUT WITH
WHAT'S HAPPENED,

04:59.792 --> 05:01.250
WE DON'T EXPECT
YOU'D WANT
TO DO THAT.

05:01.250 --> 05:03.375
I APPRECIATE THE CONCERN.

05:03.375 --> 05:05.250
DAWSON, YOU'RE
MORE IMPORTANT
THAN THE RESTAURANT.

05:05.250 --> 05:07.041
WE'LL PULL OUT
OF THE RACE.

05:07.041 --> 05:08.834
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT.
I MEAN...

05:08.834 --> 05:11.917
IF IT'S IMPORTANT TO MOM
AND THE RESTAURANT,
IT'S FINE.

05:11.917 --> 05:13.667
LOOK, HONEY,
I'M NOT TRYING TO
DEFEND PACEY HERE.

05:13.667 --> 05:15.792
I WOULD JUST HATE
TO SEE YOU LOSE
YOUR BEST FRIEND.

05:15.792 --> 05:17.375
I'M FINE.

05:17.375 --> 05:17.625
ALL RIGHT?

05:19.708 --> 05:22.166
I'LL EVEN TAKE THE BANNER
TO HIM MYSELF.

05:30.959 --> 05:32.917
IT'S FOR YOU.

05:36.166 --> 05:37.417
THANKS.

05:39.583 --> 05:41.667
YOU KNOW, I COULD HAVE
COME UP AND GOT THIS
FROM YOUR PARENTS.

05:41.667 --> 05:44.542
IT'S NO PROBLEM.

05:44.542 --> 05:47.500
LOOK, DAWSON, IF YOU
WANT ME TO DROP OUT
OF THIS RACE,

05:47.500 --> 05:50.875
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO ASK ME YOURSELF.

05:50.875 --> 05:52.708
DO WHATEVER YOU WANT,
PACE.

05:52.708 --> 05:54.375
I'M ONLY DOING THIS
TO HELP YOUR MOTHER.

05:54.375 --> 05:55.708
THE WAY YOU HELPED JOEY?

05:55.708 --> 05:57.458
LOOK, IF YOU WANT
TO STAY ANGRY,
STAY ANGRY.

05:57.458 --> 05:58.792
IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER
TO ME ANYMORE.

05:58.792 --> 06:01.875
I'M JUST GLAD
IT'S FINALLY DIRECTED
AT THE RIGHT PERSON.

06:01.875 --> 06:03.041
OH, SAVE IT, PACEY.

06:03.041 --> 06:04.166
YOU KNOW,
EVERYONE ELSE MIGHT BUY

06:04.166 --> 06:06.583
THIS CHIVALROUS
SELF-DEPRECATING CRAP.

06:06.583 --> 06:07.959
I DON'T.

06:07.959 --> 06:10.000
I'M NOT DOING IT.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.542
YOU HAVE TO.
IT'S GOOD P.R.

06:11.542 --> 06:12.667
IT'S HUMILIATING.

06:12.667 --> 06:14.583
IF YOU DON'T COOK
AND SERVE PANCAKES

06:14.583 --> 06:16.083
AT THE RACE
REGISTRATION TABLE,

06:16.083 --> 06:17.208
HOW ARE PEOPLE
GONNA REMEMBER

06:17.208 --> 06:18.083
IT'S BEING SPONSORED
BY THE POTTER B & B?

06:18.083 --> 06:20.041
I'LL TELL THEM.

06:20.041 --> 06:20.959
LOOK, IF YOU'D
RATHER GO HOME

06:20.959 --> 06:24.375
AND SCRUB TOILETS
OR MAKE BEDS OR...

06:26.875 --> 06:28.208
Bessie: THAT'S
THE LAST NAME

06:28.208 --> 06:30.458
I EXPECTED TO SEE
ON PACEY'S BOAT.

06:30.458 --> 06:32.333
THAT'S A GOOD SIGN.

06:32.333 --> 06:33.000
ARE THEY
TALKING AGAIN?

06:33.000 --> 06:35.625
HOPEFULLY.

06:35.625 --> 06:36.542
AND YOU?

06:36.542 --> 06:37.417
DID YOU MEND
ANY FENCES YET?

06:37.417 --> 06:40.458
WELL, DAWSON CAME BY
THE OTHER DAY

06:40.458 --> 06:42.083
AND WANTED TO KNOW
IF I WANTED TO SPEND
SOME TIME WITH HIM.

06:42.083 --> 06:44.458
TO WHICH YOU SAID?

06:44.458 --> 06:45.417
I DON'T KNOW,
I JUST--

06:45.417 --> 06:46.708
IT DOESN'T
FEEL RIGHT, YOU KNOW?

06:46.708 --> 06:48.875
I MEAN, DAWSON AND I
BECOMING FRIENDS AGAIN

06:48.875 --> 06:50.083
WHILE HE AND PACEY--

06:50.083 --> 06:52.750
LET DAWSON AND PACEY
TAKE CARE OF DAWSON
AND PACEY.

06:52.750 --> 06:54.208
THEY'RE BIG BOYS.
THEY'LL WORK IT OUT.

06:54.208 --> 06:57.333
BESIDES,
YOU SAW THE BANNER.

06:58.458 --> 06:59.750
MAYBE THEY
ALREADY HAVE.

07:02.333 --> 07:04.917
OH, ISN'T THIS
THRILLING?

07:04.917 --> 07:06.875
THE START OF
A NEW TRADITION.

07:06.875 --> 07:09.250
FASHIONING THE REGATTA
WINNER'S WREATHS

07:09.250 --> 07:11.250
HAS ALWAYS BEEN
MY SOLE RESPONSIBILITY

07:11.250 --> 07:14.000
FOR THE WOMEN'S LEAGUE,
EVER SINCE 1953.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.834
SHARING IT WITH
YOU YOUNG PEOPLE
IS VERY EXCITING.

07:17.834 --> 07:18.750
YOU KNOW,
IT'S MOMENTS
LIKE THESE

07:18.750 --> 07:21.000
I'M CONVINCED
I'M STRAIGHT.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.750
OH, COME NOW.

07:22.750 --> 07:24.417
HOW OFTEN TO YOU GET
A CHANCE TO CREATE

07:24.417 --> 07:26.917
SUCH A JUBILANT
PUBLIC DISPLAY?

07:28.959 --> 07:33.834
OH, LOOKS LIKE
WE'RE NOT THE ONLY ONES
CREATING A PUBLIC DISPLAY.

07:33.834 --> 07:34.792
WHAT?

07:37.125 --> 07:40.458
OH, MY GOD.
COULD THIS POSSIBLY
BE MORE EMBARRASSING?

07:40.458 --> 07:41.667
HOW LONG
CAN HE LAST?

07:41.667 --> 07:43.291
HOW LONG HAS HE BEEN
DOING THIS, ANYWAY?

07:43.291 --> 07:44.542
FOR, LIKE, A WEEK.
HE STOOD OUTSIDE OUR WINDOW

07:44.542 --> 07:45.959
FOR OVER AN HOUR
YESTERDAY.

07:45.959 --> 07:47.875
IN THE RAIN.

07:47.875 --> 07:49.125
EXACTLY WHAT
UNSPEAKABLE CRIME

07:49.125 --> 07:50.333
IS HE ASKING
FORGIVENESS FOR?

07:50.333 --> 07:51.792
I DEFENDED HENRY TO GRAMS,

07:51.792 --> 07:54.291
SAYING THAT HE--HE WASN'T
A TYPICAL TEENAGE BOY

07:54.291 --> 07:55.708
WITH A ONE-TRACK MIND.

07:55.708 --> 07:56.291
AND?

07:56.291 --> 07:58.959
TYPICAL TEENAGE BOY,

07:58.959 --> 07:59.917
ONE-TRACK MIND.

07:59.917 --> 08:01.750
Grams: I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU EXPECT.

08:01.750 --> 08:04.417
ALL HEALTHY NORMAL BOYS
WANT THE SAME THING.

08:04.417 --> 08:07.041
OK, WHAT ARE YOU
GETTIN' AT?

08:07.041 --> 08:09.875
MY POINT IS,
TO ERR IS HUMAN,

08:09.875 --> 08:12.166
TO FORGIVE DIVINE.

08:12.166 --> 08:15.500
HASN'T HE PAID
ENOUGH PENANCE?

08:27.708 --> 08:29.708
Jack: DAWSON, HOW DO YOU
REMEMBER OUR DAD HAS A BOAT?

08:29.708 --> 08:31.417
I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER
OUR DAD HAS A BOAT.

08:31.417 --> 08:33.000
THE QUESTION IS, IS HE
USING IT THIS WEEKEND?

08:33.000 --> 08:34.166
WELL, CONSIDERING
THE FACT

08:34.166 --> 08:35.542
THAT HE TAKES IT OUT
ABOUT ONCE OR TWICE
A YEAR--

08:35.542 --> 08:38.375
MEMORIAL DAY
AND LABOR DAY--

08:38.375 --> 08:39.625
I WOULD GUESS
THE ANSWER IS NO.

08:39.625 --> 08:42.125
PERFECT.
SO, YOU THINK
I CAN BORROW IT?

08:44.250 --> 08:46.291
NO. NO. I DON'T THINK
THAT'S A VERY GOOD IDEA.

08:46.291 --> 08:47.667
WHY NOT?

08:47.667 --> 08:49.041
BECAUSE PIECES
OF THE LAST BOAT
THAT YOU BORROWED

08:49.041 --> 08:50.542
ARE STILL FLOATING
AROUND THE CREEK,
THAT'S WHY.

08:50.542 --> 08:53.000
LOOK, I REALLY
NEED A SAILBOAT.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
OK, I'VE ENTERED
THE REGATTA.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.333
WHOA. ISN'T
PACEY RACING?

08:57.333 --> 08:59.792
YEAH.

08:59.792 --> 09:00.500
SO DON'T YOU THINK
PISTOLS AT DAWN

09:00.500 --> 09:02.500
WOULD BE A MORE SUITABLE,

09:02.500 --> 09:04.667
NOT TO MENTION ROMANTIC,
WAY TO SETTLE THIS THING?

09:04.667 --> 09:07.041
Andie:
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH
DAWSON SEIZING THE DAY?

09:07.041 --> 09:08.542
OK? I MEAN, PACEY
MOST CERTAINLY DID.

09:08.542 --> 09:09.917
IT'S NOT
ABOUT PACEY.
IT'S ABOUT JOEY.

09:09.917 --> 09:13.083
ALL RIGHT, LOOK.
I'VE SPENT THE LAST
2 MONTHS

09:13.083 --> 09:15.083
LYING ON MY BED,
STARING AT
EMPTY WALLS.

09:15.083 --> 09:16.417
IT'S NO WONDER JOEY
GOT AWAY FROM ME.

09:16.417 --> 09:20.667
THIS IS MY CHANCE
TO ACTUALLY SHOW HER
HOW MUCH I CARE.

09:20.667 --> 09:21.959
YOU GOTTA HELP ME.

09:21.959 --> 09:23.125
IT'S NOT RIGHT.

09:23.125 --> 09:25.000
NO, JACK, YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:25.000 --> 09:26.708
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT'S NOT RIGHT:

09:26.708 --> 09:29.291
WATCHING THE PERSON YOU LOVE
THROW EVERYTHING AWAY

09:29.291 --> 09:30.458
SO THEY CAN BE
WITH SOMEONE ELSE,

09:30.458 --> 09:34.667
LISTENING TO THEM LIE
TO YOUR FACE DAY AFTER DAY.

09:34.667 --> 09:36.208
THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

09:36.208 --> 09:38.750
SO IF YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO HELP DAWSON, I WILL.

09:40.792 --> 09:42.583
ALL RIGHT.

09:59.834 --> 10:00.583
HEY.
HEY.

10:00.583 --> 10:02.417
WOULD YOU
LIKE TO SAMPLE

10:02.417 --> 10:03.667
A HOMEMADE POTTER
B & B HOTCAKE?

10:03.667 --> 10:05.834
YES, MA'AM,
I BELIEVE I WOULD.

10:07.917 --> 10:08.917
THANK YOU.

10:11.750 --> 10:12.792
THANK YOU,  DAWSON.

10:12.792 --> 10:13.917
YOU HEARD ALREADY.

10:13.917 --> 10:15.542
WELL, I HAVE TO ADMIT,
I MEAN, I HAD MY DOUBTS

10:15.542 --> 10:17.417
AS TO WHETHER OR NOT
THINGS WOULD GET BETTER,

10:17.417 --> 10:18.708
BUT WHEN I SAW
YOUR RESTAURANT'S
BANNER ON PACEY'S BOAT

10:18.708 --> 10:21.834
I JUST FELT THIS
HUGE SENSE OF RELIEF.

10:21.834 --> 10:23.250
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE
THANKING ME FOR?

10:23.250 --> 10:25.208
YEAH.

10:25.208 --> 10:26.166
I THOUGHT BESSIE MIGHT
HAVE TOLD YOU ALREADY.

10:26.166 --> 10:28.458
TOLD ME WHAT?

10:28.458 --> 10:30.959
I'M ENTERING
THE BOAT RACE.

10:30.959 --> 10:31.333
THE SAILBOAT RACE?

10:31.333 --> 10:33.125
MM-HMM.

10:33.125 --> 10:34.792
WELL, WHO'S
YOUR SPONSOR?

10:34.792 --> 10:36.959
UH, YOU ARE.

10:36.959 --> 10:38.125
WHAT?

10:38.125 --> 10:40.125
I'M BEING SPONSORED
BY THE POTTER B & B.

10:40.125 --> 10:42.625
DAWSON, WE CAN'T
AFFORD THE ENTRY FEE.

10:42.625 --> 10:44.291
THAT'S BEEN
TAKEN CARE OFF.

10:52.291 --> 10:54.166
YOUR SISTER WAS PRETTY
PSYCHED ABOUT THE IDEA.

10:54.166 --> 10:56.792
I'M SURE SHE WAS.

10:56.792 --> 10:57.959
JOEY, A VICTORY--

10:57.959 --> 10:59.959
HOWEVER SLIM
MY CHANCES MIGHT BE--

10:59.959 --> 11:01.792
WOULD GUARANTEE
THE B & B THE COVER
OF THE TOURIST BROCHURE.

11:01.792 --> 11:03.291
YOU GUYS WOULD BE BOOKED
THE WHOLE SEASON.

11:03.291 --> 11:06.041
LOOK, DAWSON,
I REALLY DON'T THINK
THIS IS A GOOD IDEA.

11:06.041 --> 11:07.125
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.

11:07.125 --> 11:08.959
ALL RIGHT? ALL I WANT
TO DO IS HELP.

11:08.959 --> 11:10.625
IF I NEEDED HELP
YOU'D BE THERE FOR ME, RIGHT?

11:10.625 --> 11:13.083
DAWSON--
OF COURSE YOU WOULD.

11:13.083 --> 11:16.667
SO SIGN ME UP
AND WISH ME LUCK.

11:26.583 --> 11:27.875
OK, BEFORE YOU
GET MAD AT ME--

11:27.875 --> 11:30.083
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE
ABOUT 300 PANCAKES

11:30.083 --> 11:31.125
AND ONE SPONSORED
SAILBOAT

11:31.125 --> 11:32.375
TOO LATE FOR THAT,
BESSIE.

11:32.375 --> 11:34.333
HE BEGGED TO ENTER THE RACE
ON OUR BEHALF,

11:34.333 --> 11:37.000
AND ARE WE REALLY
IN THE POSITION
TO TURN DOWN FREE ADVERTISING?

11:37.000 --> 11:38.333
IT'S NOT FREE.

11:38.333 --> 11:40.000
OK, DAWSON MAY HAVE
PUT DOWN THE CASH,

11:40.000 --> 11:41.166
BUT YOU'RE
OBLIGATING ME--

11:41.166 --> 11:43.291
WHAT? TO APPRECIATE
HIS FRIENDSHIP?

11:43.291 --> 11:44.708
THIS ISN'T ABOUT
FRIENDSHIP.

11:44.708 --> 11:46.000
DAWSON WANTS
TO BEAT PACEY.

11:46.000 --> 11:50.458
WELL, IF 2 BOYS WANT
TO COMPETE ON OUR BEHALF,

11:50.458 --> 11:51.708
I SAY LET 'EM RACE.

11:51.708 --> 11:53.208
THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO STOP.

11:53.208 --> 11:56.875
I MEAN, WE BROKE IT OFF,
AND IT WAS ALL JUST
SUPPOSED TO STOP.

11:56.875 --> 11:59.375
WHAT DID YOU EXPECT, JO?

11:59.375 --> 12:00.458
THAT YOU WOULD
END THINGS WITH PACE,

12:00.458 --> 12:01.834
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN,

12:01.834 --> 12:03.041
THINGS WOULD JUST GO BACK
TO THE WAY THEY WERE?

12:03.041 --> 12:06.625
IT'S THE HARDEST PART
ABOUT BEING AN ADULT, SIS.

12:06.625 --> 12:10.458
YOUR ACTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES,
FORCING LIFE TO CONSTANTLY
MOVE FORWARD.

12:10.458 --> 12:12.834
WHY DO YOU THINK
THEY CALL IT "GROWING UP"?

12:12.834 --> 12:14.708
WELL, SINCE YOU'RE SUCH
AN EXPERT GROWNUP,

12:14.708 --> 12:16.208
DO YOU HAVE ANY ADVICE?

12:16.208 --> 12:20.000
ACCEPT THE CONSEQUENCES
AND DO SOMETHING TO
MAKE THINGS BETTER.

12:23.875 --> 12:24.875
[KNOCK KNOCK]

12:24.875 --> 12:26.041
COME IN.

12:30.500 --> 12:31.417
UH, I HOPE
YOU DON'T MIND.

12:31.417 --> 12:33.041
JACK LET ME IN.

12:33.041 --> 12:35.333
NO. SO IS DAWSON STILL
DOWNSTAIRS WITH HIM

12:35.333 --> 12:37.250
GOING OVER
SAILING FOR DUMMIES?

12:37.250 --> 12:39.917
ACTUALLY,
THEY'RE HEADING OUT TO GET
SOME HANDS-ON EXPERIENCE.

12:39.917 --> 12:40.917
HMM. LOOKS LIKE
YOU AND PACEY

12:40.917 --> 12:42.750
WILL HAVE SOME
COMPETITION AFTER ALL.

12:42.750 --> 12:46.041
YEAH, BUT THAT'S NOT
WHY I CAME HERE.

12:46.041 --> 12:47.667
I GOT SOME
REALLY GOOD NEWS.

12:47.667 --> 12:50.083
THAT SCHOLARSHIP TO RAWLEY...

12:50.083 --> 12:51.250
IT CAME THROUGH.

12:51.250 --> 12:53.333
AH!

12:53.333 --> 12:54.959
WILL, THAT'S FANTASTIC!

12:54.959 --> 12:56.041
IT'S AMAZING, ISN'T IT?

12:56.041 --> 12:57.375
I FINALLY CAUGHT A BREAK.

12:57.375 --> 12:59.000
AND NOW YOU DON'T
HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT
YOUR DAD ANYMORE.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
I MEAN, THAT'S GREAT.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.750
YEAH, BUT PACEY...

13:02.750 --> 13:04.250
I'M KINDA
WORRIED ABOUT HIM.

13:04.250 --> 13:07.208
YEAH, WELL,
PACEY AND JOEY

13:07.208 --> 13:10.208
BROUGHT THIS SITUATION
ON THEMSELVES, ALL RIGHT?

13:10.208 --> 13:12.083
BECAUSE THEY DEVELOPED
FEELINGS FOR EACH OTHER

13:12.083 --> 13:13.041
AND HAD THE GUTS
TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT?

13:13.041 --> 13:17.083
IS THAT THE WAY
YOU SEE THIS, WILL?

13:17.083 --> 13:18.875
WE WERE ALL FRIENDS.

13:18.875 --> 13:21.959
THEY DIDN'T SET OUT
TO HURT YOU.

13:21.959 --> 13:23.500
YEAH, WELL,
ONCE UPON A TIME,

13:23.500 --> 13:24.875
I DIDN'T SET OUT
TO HURT PACEY, EITHER,

13:24.875 --> 13:27.083
BUT HE OFFERED ME
NO FORGIVENESS,

13:27.083 --> 13:30.959
AND OUR RELATIONSHIP CAME
TO AN EARTH-SHATTERING HALT.

13:30.959 --> 13:33.792
NOW THINGS ARE NEVER GONNA
BE THE WAY THEY WERE.

13:33.792 --> 13:35.667
IF YOU CAN'T LET GO
OF ALL THIS ANGER, ANDIE,

13:35.667 --> 13:37.500
THEY PROBABLY NEVER WILL,

13:37.500 --> 13:40.792
AND INSTEAD OF YOU BEING
THIS WARM-HEARTED,
CHEERFUL PERSON

13:40.792 --> 13:42.041
THAT I MET ON SPRING BREAK,

13:42.041 --> 13:44.875
YOU'LL JUST END UP BEING
THE KIND OF PERSON THAT--

13:44.875 --> 13:46.000
THAT I FEEL SORRY FOR...

13:49.250 --> 13:51.750
AND I KNOW
YOU'RE BETTER THAN THAT.

14:02.333 --> 14:03.667
WATCH OUT!
WATCH OUT!

14:03.667 --> 14:05.583
DAWSON! GOD!

14:05.583 --> 14:07.208
YOU OK?
YOU ALL RIGHT?

14:07.208 --> 14:08.458
YEAH.

14:08.458 --> 14:10.083
UM, ALL RIGHT, SO THAT
DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN,

14:10.083 --> 14:11.542
TIE THE--TIE THE ROPE
TO THE THING.

14:11.542 --> 14:12.083
WHAT THE HELL'S
'THE THING"?

14:12.083 --> 14:12.834
THE METAL THING.

14:12.834 --> 14:13.959
YEAH, THAT HELPS,
POPEYE.

14:13.959 --> 14:17.083
Mitch: IT'S CALLED
THE AFT WINCH,

14:17.083 --> 14:18.792
AND IF YOU
DON'T TIGHTEN
THAT JIB SHEET

14:18.792 --> 14:21.625
AND SECURE
YOUR TILLER,

14:21.625 --> 14:23.208
IT'S NOT GONNA
BE PRETTY.

14:25.667 --> 14:28.708
OK, I GOT THE TILLER.
YOU GET THE JIB SHEET,
ALL RIGHT?

14:28.708 --> 14:29.166
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT. CHECK.

14:32.708 --> 14:34.166
WHERE THE HELL'S
THE JIB SHEET?

14:34.166 --> 14:36.708
YOU'RE STANDING
ON IT.

14:36.708 --> 14:39.041
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT?
MAYBE I SHOULD JUST
GO BACK TO HELPING GRAMS.

14:39.041 --> 14:41.500
I MIGHT LIVE
A LITTLE LONGER.

14:41.500 --> 14:42.708
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING?

14:42.708 --> 14:43.834
WELL, TRYING TO GET
OUT ON THE WATER

14:43.834 --> 14:46.208
BEFORE
THE FIREWORKS START.

14:46.208 --> 14:47.333
LOOKS LIKE
YOU GUYS

14:47.333 --> 14:48.750
COULD USE
A LITTLE HELP.

14:48.750 --> 14:50.208
WELL, DAD,

14:50.208 --> 14:50.917
EVERYONE WHO KNOWS
WHAT THEY'RE DOING

14:50.917 --> 14:52.792
IS IN THE RACE
ALREADY.

14:52.792 --> 14:53.875
NOT EVERYONE.

14:53.875 --> 14:55.542
OR THEY'RE
SPONSORING A BOAT.

14:55.542 --> 14:57.875
THE RESTAURANT
IS SPONSORING PACEY.

14:57.875 --> 15:01.834
I, ON THE OTHER HAND,
AM STILL AVAILABLE.

15:01.834 --> 15:03.083
ALL RIGHT, DAD.
THE LAST THING I WANT TO DO

15:03.083 --> 15:04.792
IS DIVIDE THE LEERY HOUSEHOLD
EVEN MORE.

15:04.792 --> 15:06.333
ANY WORTHWHILE
RELATIONSHIP

15:06.333 --> 15:07.041
HAS TO ENDURE
SOME CONFLICT,

15:07.041 --> 15:09.834
DON'T YOU THINK,
DAWSON?

15:11.208 --> 15:12.208
IF YOU'RE SAYING
YOU WANT TO LEND A HAND,

15:12.208 --> 15:15.041
WE WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY
TO ACCEPT.

15:15.041 --> 15:16.708
SURE.
THANK YOU.

15:42.792 --> 15:43.917
LOOK, PACEY,
THIS WASN'T MY IDEA.

15:43.917 --> 15:45.792
I DIDN'T ASK HIM
TO DO IT,

15:45.792 --> 15:46.750
BUT I MEAN,
YOU KNOW DAWSON.

15:46.750 --> 15:48.417
ONCE HE GETS SOMETHING
IN HIS MIND--

15:48.417 --> 15:50.417
I'M SORRY.

15:50.417 --> 15:53.291
IF IT WASN'T YOUR IDEA,
WHY ARE YOU APOLOGIZING?

15:53.291 --> 15:54.500
BECAUSE
YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY UPSET.

15:54.500 --> 15:59.083
I'M UPSET BECAUSE
WE HAVEN'T SPOKEN
IN 2 WEEKS.

15:59.083 --> 16:00.291
NOW WHEN
WE FINALLY DO,

16:00.291 --> 16:01.458
THE FIRST WORDS
OUT OF YOUR MOUTH,

16:01.458 --> 16:03.333
AS PER USUAL,
ARE ABOUT DAWSON.

16:06.500 --> 16:09.750
WELL, THIS CONVERSATION
IS ABOUT TO GET HARDER, PACEY.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.625
YOU WANT ME
TO DROP OUT, TOO.

16:16.250 --> 16:19.083
WOW. DAWSON LEERY COULDN'T
HAVE SCRIPTED THIS ONE
ANY BETTER, COULD HE?

16:19.083 --> 16:20.291
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

16:20.291 --> 16:21.458
WELL, DON'T YOU GET IT?

16:21.458 --> 16:22.667
NO MATTER WHAT I DO,
HE WINS.

16:22.667 --> 16:25.166
IF I DROP OUT, HE WINS.

16:25.166 --> 16:27.959
IF I STAY IN THE RACE,
I'M FORCED INTO DIRECT
COMPETITION WITH THE GUY,

16:27.959 --> 16:29.959
AND IF I ACTUALLY WIN,
I DON'T BEAT HIM,
I BEAT YOU.

16:29.959 --> 16:32.542
SO GUESS
WHO REALLY WINS THERE?

16:32.542 --> 16:36.542
WELL...

16:36.542 --> 16:38.625
MAYBE YOU COULD TALK TO HIM.
I MEAN, TRY TO WORK IT OUT.

16:38.625 --> 16:41.667
YEAH, WE TRIED THAT.
HE DOESN'T REALLY WANT
TO TALK TO ME RIGHT NOW,

16:41.667 --> 16:44.000
AND WHEN HE DOES,
IT'S NOT ENTIRELY CIVIL.

16:45.834 --> 16:48.125
WELL, COULD YOU TRY AGAIN,
PACEY, PLEASE?

16:51.208 --> 16:53.750
YEAH, IF THAT'S
WHAT YOU WANT.

16:53.750 --> 16:57.250
IF THAT'S ALL
THAT YOU WANT.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.500
THAT'S ALL THAT I WANT.

17:05.165 --> 17:06.875
OK.

17:06.875 --> 17:08.333
OK. THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO.

17:12.000 --> 17:12.583
THANK YOU, PACEY.

17:12.583 --> 17:14.541
YEAH.

17:16.625 --> 17:19.750
HEY, POTTER.

17:19.750 --> 17:22.416
IT WAS NICE
TALKIN' TO YOU.

17:32.834 --> 17:34.208
AND SOMEBODY WILL BE
WITH YOU SHORTLY

17:34.208 --> 17:35.333
TO TAKE
YOUR DRINK ORDERS.

17:35.333 --> 17:37.750
ENJOY YOUR EVENING.

17:37.750 --> 17:39.959
OK, A FEW HOURS AGO,
HENRY WAS CUTE AND ENDEARING.

17:39.959 --> 17:41.166
NOW HE'S GETTING INTO
ANNOYING AND PSYCHOTIC.

17:43.917 --> 17:45.625
OH, MY GOD. I'M SO SORRY.
I DIDN'T THINK HE WOULD
LAST THIS LONG.

17:45.625 --> 17:48.583
HONEY, IT'S GETTING RIDICULOUS.
THIS IS OUR BUSIEST WEEKEND.

17:48.583 --> 17:50.083
NOT ONLY IS HE
DISTRACTING THE CUSTOMERS,
BUT HE'S BLOCKING THE VIEW.

17:50.083 --> 17:52.750
GO TALK TO HIM.
THROW A NET OVER HIM,.

17:52.750 --> 17:53.625
I DON'T CARE.
JUST DRAG HIM AWAY.

17:53.625 --> 17:55.583
GET HIM AWAY
FROM MY RESTAURANT.

18:02.417 --> 18:04.208
Jen: ALL RIGHT, LOOK.
I'VE ALREADY ACCEPTED
YOUR APOLOGY.

18:04.208 --> 18:06.083
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU'RE MAKING ME
COME UP TO THE ROOF.

18:06.083 --> 18:08.417
Henry: I WANT TO SHOW YOU
SOMETHING.

18:08.417 --> 18:10.583
WELL, YOU PROMISE
TO DROP THAT WHOLE
SIGN THING, RIGHT?

18:10.583 --> 18:12.542
I PROMISE.

18:12.542 --> 18:13.875
YEAH, WELL, I HOPE SO,

18:13.875 --> 18:16.208
BECAUSE YOU WERE
RAPIDLY APPROACHING
THE POINT WHERE I...

18:19.583 --> 18:20.625
[STUNNED] HENRY.

18:20.625 --> 18:23.291
OH, MY GOD.

18:23.291 --> 18:25.125
YOU DID ALL THIS?

18:25.125 --> 18:29.458
WELL, THE TOWN ORGANIZED
THE FESTIVITIES.

18:29.458 --> 18:31.667
I JUST DID THE ROOF PART.

18:31.667 --> 18:32.625
WHY?

18:32.625 --> 18:35.583
FOR YOU.

18:35.583 --> 18:38.917
I WANT YOU TO KNOW
HOW SORRY I REALLY AM.

18:38.917 --> 18:42.583
I KNOW.
YOU JUST TOLD ME.

18:42.583 --> 18:44.917
I TOLD YOU.

18:44.917 --> 18:47.333
BUT I WANT TO SHOW YOU, TOO.

18:47.333 --> 18:50.125
I CAN DO MORE
THAN JUST TALK.

18:50.125 --> 18:52.625
I KNOW THAT YOU CAN.

18:52.625 --> 18:54.291
YOU CAN LISTEN, TOO,

18:54.291 --> 18:57.208
WHICH IS--WHICH IS WHY
I GOT SO UPSET.

18:57.208 --> 18:59.625
BECAUSE I STOPPED
HEARING YOU.

18:59.625 --> 19:01.000
YEAH.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.625
I PROMISE THAT WILL
NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.

19:03.625 --> 19:08.166
I'M--I'M GLAD THAT WE DIDN'T
RUSH INTO HAVING SEX.

19:08.166 --> 19:09.708
REALLY?

19:09.708 --> 19:13.792
WELL, I'D--I'D BE LYING
IF I TOLD YOU I DIDN'T
THINK ABOUT IT

19:13.792 --> 19:15.583
PRETTY MUCH EVERY TIME
I BREATHE IN OR OUT.

19:15.583 --> 19:19.458
I CAN'T TELL YOU
THAT I'M GONNA STOP
WANTING YOU SO BADLY,

19:19.458 --> 19:23.917
THAT I GET A LITTLE
CRAZY SOMETIMES, BUT...

19:26.125 --> 19:28.417
I DON'T WANT TO BE
LIKE EVERY OTHER GUY
IN YOUR LIFE, JEN.

19:28.417 --> 19:31.166
I WANT EVERYTHING WE DO
TO BE NEW,

19:31.166 --> 19:33.250
SOMETHING
YOU'VE NEVER DONE BEFORE.

19:35.166 --> 19:38.458
I HAVE DEFINITELY
NEVER HAD A PICNIC
ON A ROOF BEFORE.

19:46.417 --> 19:48.166
FROM NOW ON,

19:48.166 --> 19:52.166
I'M GOING TO DO EVERYTHING
IN MY POWER TO BE THE MOST
ORIGINAL PERSON IN YOUR LIFE.

19:52.166 --> 19:56.417
HENRY PARKER,
YOU ALREADY ARE.

20:17.917 --> 20:18.417
WHAT ARE YOU
TRYING TO PROVE?

20:24.375 --> 20:26.000
I'M JUST TRYING
TO HELP JOEY.

20:28.166 --> 20:29.667
JUST TRYING TO...

20:30.875 --> 20:35.291
LOOK, MAN, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST TAKE A SWING AT ME?

20:35.291 --> 20:36.625
I MEAN HONESTLY,
JUST TAKE A POKE.

20:36.625 --> 20:40.250
GET IT OVER WITH.
SAVE US BOTH A LOT
OF TIME AND TROUBLE.

20:40.250 --> 20:42.291
WOULDN'T INVOLVE
OUR FRIENDS.

20:42.291 --> 20:43.208
OR FAMILY.

20:43.208 --> 20:45.834
DO YOU THINK THAT
INDULGING YOURSELF

20:45.834 --> 20:50.125
IN SOME JAMES DEAN MEETS
GREASED LIGHTNING  FANTASY,

20:50.125 --> 20:52.708
THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY
GONNA PROVE YOU'RE
A BETTER MAN THAN I AM?

20:52.708 --> 20:54.583
I DON'T HAVE TO PROVE THAT.

20:54.583 --> 20:56.625
YOU MADE THAT CLEAR
WHEN YOU MOVED IN ON JOEY.

20:56.625 --> 21:01.041
FOR THE VERY LAST TIME,
DAWSON,

21:01.041 --> 21:03.083
I MADE A MISTAKE.

21:03.083 --> 21:04.208
MM-HMM.

21:04.208 --> 21:05.333
I THOUGHT YOU
OF ALL PEOPLE

21:05.333 --> 21:08.208
WOULD UNDERSTAND SOMEONE
FALLING FOR JOEY POTTER.

21:10.583 --> 21:13.542
ARE YOU DELUSIONAL ENOUGH
TO BELIEVE THAT YOU ACTUALLY
HAVE SOMETHING REAL WITH JOEY?

21:13.542 --> 21:15.959
WELL, IF I DO,
IT'S BECAUSE OF
HER OWN FREE WILL.

21:15.959 --> 21:18.917
DO YOU REALLY THINK
A COUPLE CONFUSED WEEKS

21:18.917 --> 21:21.750
MEANS ANYTHING COMPARED TO
THE LIFETIME THAT WE'VE HAD?

21:21.750 --> 21:23.208
AND DO YOU
ACTUALLY THINK

21:23.208 --> 21:25.458
THAT YOU COULD
POSSIBLY HOLD ON
TO THAT BEAUTIFUL WOMAN

21:25.458 --> 21:27.083
WITH SOME SORT OF
SELFISH ULTIMATUM?

21:27.083 --> 21:29.250
ANSWER MY QUESTION, PACEY.

21:29.250 --> 21:31.000
DO YOU REALLY THINK
YOU CAN COMPETE WITH HISTORY?

21:31.000 --> 21:32.417
SOME HISTORY.

21:32.417 --> 21:34.917
15 YEARS OF WATCHING
PG MOVIES IN YOUR BEDROOM,

21:34.917 --> 21:37.542
FOLLOWED BY
ANOTHER YEAR AND A HALF
PRETENDING TO BE GROWN UP,

21:37.542 --> 21:40.417
ONLY TO DROP EACH OTHER
AT THE FIRST SIGN OF CRISES?

21:40.417 --> 21:41.083
THAT'S YOUR HISTORY?

21:41.083 --> 21:42.959
COME ON, MAN.

21:42.959 --> 21:44.792
AND YOU CALL THIS WOMAN
YOUR SOULMATE?

21:44.792 --> 21:47.959
YES, I DO, AND YOU KNEW THAT,
AND YOU WENT AFTER HER ANYWAY.

21:47.959 --> 21:49.125
RIGHT AFTER
YOU REJECTED HER.

21:49.125 --> 21:51.625
OH, SO SHE WAS VULNERABLE.
PERFECT FOR YOU, RIGHT?

21:51.625 --> 21:54.041
'CAUSE YOU'RE ONLY INTERESTED
IN GIRLS YOU CAN SAVE OR SCREW,
RIGHT, PACE?

22:13.583 --> 22:15.375
YOU'RE UP EARLY.

22:15.375 --> 22:18.250
I SEE I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE
DRESSED IN WHAT SHE WAS
WEARING LAST NIGHT.

22:18.250 --> 22:21.208
I KNOW. I KNOW.
I'M SORRY.

22:21.208 --> 22:24.708
I SHOULD HAVE CALLED,
BUT I FIGURED THAT
YOU'D BE IN BED ASLEEP.

22:24.708 --> 22:25.834
YOU FIGURED WRONG.

22:25.834 --> 22:28.333
I WAS MOMENTS AWAY FROM
CALLING SHERIFF WITTER.

22:28.333 --> 22:31.583
GRAMS, I WAS FINE.
I WAS WITH HENRY.

22:31.583 --> 22:33.375
YOU SPENT THE NIGHT
WITH HENRY?

22:33.375 --> 22:36.166
YEAH, ON THE--ON THE ROOF
OF THE RESTAURANT.

22:36.166 --> 22:39.708
GOD, IT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL.

22:39.708 --> 22:42.917
THE BOATS WERE ALL
LIT UP ON THE WATER,

22:42.917 --> 22:45.375
AND THE WHOLE TOWN
WAS DOWN BELOW APPLAUDING
FOR THE FIREWORKS,

22:45.375 --> 22:49.166
BUT IT FELT LIKE
IT WAS FOR US.

22:49.166 --> 22:51.375
AND HE HAD A BLANKET
AND A PICNIC AND--

22:51.375 --> 22:53.834
WELL, NOT MUCH OF A PICNIC,
ACTUALLY.

22:53.834 --> 22:59.375
IT WAS 2 LUNCHABLES,
BUT IT'S THE THOUGHT
THAT COUNTS.

22:59.375 --> 23:02.583
GRAMS, I'M SORRY.
WE JUST LOST TRACK OF TIME.

23:04.083 --> 23:09.166
IS THAT THE FASHIONABLE
EUPHEMISM BANDIED ABOUT
ON MTV THESE DAYS?

23:09.166 --> 23:10.250
LOSING TRACK OF TIME?

23:10.250 --> 23:11.875
I THOUGHT THAT
YOU'D BE HAPPY.

23:11.875 --> 23:16.041
I MEAN, IT WAS YOUR ADVICE
THAT COMPELLED ME TO MOVE
FORWARD WITH HENRY.

23:16.041 --> 23:18.542
IT WAS NOT MY ADVICE
TO SLEEP WITH THE BOY.

23:18.542 --> 23:21.375
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

23:21.375 --> 23:24.583
TO SEE YOU SLIP BACK
INTO YOUR OLD LIFESTYLE

23:24.583 --> 23:27.417
LIKE YOU NEVER
LEFT IT...

23:27.417 --> 23:28.500
I EXPECTED MORE OF YOU,
JENNIFER.

23:31.708 --> 23:33.583
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I EXPECTED MORE OF YOU, TOO.

23:33.583 --> 23:37.583
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
I HAVE  CHANGED,

23:37.583 --> 23:39.417
AND IT HASN'T BEEN EASY.

23:39.417 --> 23:41.083
ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING
THAT THE ONE PERSON
THAT I COUNT ON THE MOST

23:41.083 --> 23:43.166
CAN'T EVEN SEE IT.

23:51.583 --> 23:54.333
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE HELPING HIM RACE.

23:54.333 --> 23:56.834
WELL, IT'S
A BOAT RACE, RIGHT,

23:56.834 --> 23:57.625
NOT BEN-HUR.

23:57.625 --> 24:00.583
BESIDES, ONE WAY
OR ANOTHER,

24:00.583 --> 24:01.583
THIS IS A FIGHT
THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN,

24:01.583 --> 24:04.041
AND I, FOR ONE,
AM PROUD OF DAWSON

24:04.041 --> 24:05.792
FOR STICKING UP
FOR HIMSELF.

24:05.792 --> 24:07.959
WELL, I'M NOT AGAINST
FIGHTING FOR WHAT YOU WANT,

24:07.959 --> 24:10.125
BUT SHOULDN'T WE
BE TEACHING DAWSON

24:10.125 --> 24:13.291
THAT YOU FIGHT
WITH YOUR MIND, WITH WORDS?

24:13.291 --> 24:16.000
WELL, YEAH, BUT...

24:16.000 --> 24:18.291
WELL, SOMETIMES
TWO PEOPLE HAVE
BEEN THROUGH SO MUCH

24:18.291 --> 24:20.625
AND HAD SO MANY
CONVERSATIONS

24:20.625 --> 24:24.875
THAT THE ONLY WAY
TO REALLY MAKE IT CLEAR

24:24.875 --> 24:26.291
IS ACTION.

24:26.291 --> 24:29.959
OBVIOUSLY DAWSON
HAS MORE GUTS THAN
EITHER ONE OF US.

24:29.959 --> 24:31.125
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

24:31.125 --> 24:33.959
JUST WHAT I THOUGHT
MIGHT HAVE BEEN
GOING ON

24:33.959 --> 24:36.542
AROUND HERE
LATELY...

24:36.542 --> 24:37.917
BETWEEN YOU AND ME.

24:43.583 --> 24:46.959
OK. WELL, YOU KNOW,
I'D STICK AROUND AND TALK
ABOUT THIS SOME MORE

24:46.959 --> 24:52.291
BUT THAT DOESN'T REALLY SEEM
TO BE VERY EFFECTIVE,
NOW, DOES IT?

24:59.458 --> 25:01.375
Man on P.A.: WELCOME
TO CAPESIDE'S REGATTA.

25:01.375 --> 25:02.834
IT'S 10 SECONDS BEFORE
THE START.

25:02.834 --> 25:05.959
THE BOATS ARE MANEUVERING
INTO POSITION.

25:05.959 --> 25:07.333
AND THEY'RE OFF!

26:29.250 --> 26:31.417
Man on P.A.: AND AS
THE LEADERS ENTER
THE PIVOTAL TURN,

26:31.417 --> 26:32.792
IT LOOKS LIKE TRUE LOVE
IS OUT FRONT,

26:32.792 --> 26:35.250
BUT CARPE DIEM,
IN A BOLD MOVE HERE,

26:35.250 --> 26:37.000
THEY ARE GAINING GROUND.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.917
ALL RIGHT, NOW, DAWSON,
WHEN WE GET UP HERE,

26:38.917 --> 26:40.667
WE GOT TO GIVE THEM
BUOY ROOM.

26:40.667 --> 26:43.000
ALL RIGHT, 2 LENGTHS
AT THE MARK.

26:43.000 --> 26:43.917
WHAT THE HELL
ARE THESE GUYS DOING?

26:43.917 --> 26:46.000
Will: I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.083
HEY! HEY, GIVE US ROOM!

26:48.083 --> 26:49.875
Man on P.A.: TRUE LOVE
AND CARPE DIEM  ARE
NECK AND NECK.

26:49.875 --> 26:51.125
THEY'RE FIGHTING
FOR THE FINISH HERE.

26:51.125 --> 26:52.291
CARPE DIEM  IS NOT
GIVING ANY GROUND.

26:52.291 --> 26:55.083
IN FACT, CARPE DIEM
IS NOT ACKNOWLEDGING

26:55.083 --> 26:56.875
TRUE LOVE'S  REQUEST
FOR SEA ROOM AT THE MARK.

26:56.875 --> 26:58.834
IF ONE OF THESE BOATS
DOESN'T VEER OFF COURSE,

26:58.834 --> 27:01.583
IN A MINUTE, WE'RE GONNA
HAVE A MAJOR COLLISION.

27:01.583 --> 27:02.417
THEY'RE HEADED
FOR THE SAME SPOT.

27:02.417 --> 27:03.583
ARE THEY CRAZY?

27:03.583 --> 27:04.500
HEY! WE GOT
THE RIGHT OF WAY!

27:04.500 --> 27:06.875
YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO BACK OFF.

27:06.875 --> 27:08.458
I'M NOT GETTING
OUT OF HIS WAY.

27:08.458 --> 27:09.583
Mitch: 2 LENGTHS--

27:09.583 --> 27:10.542
I'M NOT GETTING
OUT OF HIS WAY!

27:10.542 --> 27:11.583
Jack: GIVE ROOM!
COME ON!

27:11.583 --> 27:14.625
GET OFF OUR LINE!
MOVE OFF!

27:14.625 --> 27:15.208
Mitch: WE'RE GONNA
RUN HIM INTO THE DOCK!

27:15.208 --> 27:17.708
DAWSON, COME ON!

27:17.708 --> 27:19.333
GIVE US ROOM!

27:24.000 --> 27:25.083
Man on P.A.:
OH, THEY'RE GONNA--

27:25.083 --> 27:26.417
DAMN!

27:26.417 --> 27:28.917
TRUE LOVE,  WITH
THE RIGHT OF WAY,

27:28.917 --> 27:30.708
CHANGES COURSE
TO AVOID A COLLISION.

27:30.708 --> 27:34.959
CARPE DIEM  DOES
CROSS THE LINE FIRST.

27:34.959 --> 27:36.375
WE DID IT!

27:36.375 --> 27:38.917
CARPE DIEM,  THEY DIDN'T
BACK OFF AT ALL.

27:38.917 --> 27:40.500
I'M SURE THAT'S
A DISQUALIFICATION.

27:40.500 --> 27:42.542
MISCHIEF  IS APPROACHING
THE FINISH SECOND,

27:42.542 --> 27:44.708
AND UNFORTUNATELY,
TRUE LOVE,

27:44.708 --> 27:46.375
THEY'LL FINISH
A DISTANT FIFTH.

27:49.834 --> 27:52.375
WE WON!
NO, YOU DIDN'T,
DAWSON.

27:52.375 --> 27:54.708
YOU LOST. IF YOU KNEW
A LITTLE BIT MORE
ABOUT SAILING,

27:54.708 --> 27:55.834
YOU WOULD KNOW THAT
YOU GOT DISQUALIFIED.

27:55.834 --> 27:56.917
FOR NEARLY
KILLING ME!

27:56.917 --> 27:57.875
I GOT
DISQUALIFIED?!

27:57.875 --> 27:59.166
I GOT MORE WORDS
FOR WHAT YOU ARE.

27:59.166 --> 28:00.291
OK, LET'S NOT FORGET
WHO STARTED THIS,
PACEY!

28:00.291 --> 28:02.375
LOOK, OK, STOP!

28:02.375 --> 28:05.083
THE BOTH OF YOU STOP THIS.
I'M NOT SOME DAMN TROPHY.

28:05.083 --> 28:07.500
NO, JO. LET'S NOT  FORGET
WHO STARTED THIS, OK?

28:07.500 --> 28:08.500
LET'S NOT FORGET
WHO PUSHED ME

28:08.500 --> 28:10.000
TOWARDS JOEY POTTER
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
IT WAS YOU! YES!
IT WAS YOU, BECAUSE
YOU COULDN'T BE BOTHERED--

28:12.000 --> 28:14.333
BECAUSE I DIDN'T
WANT TO GET HURT
AGAIN, PACEY!

28:14.333 --> 28:14.959
I STILL HAD
FEELINGS FOR HER!

28:14.959 --> 28:16.750
I STILL LOVED HER!

28:16.750 --> 28:19.333
I--
I STILL LOVE HER.

28:25.375 --> 28:26.041
I HATE THIS.

28:26.041 --> 28:28.834
I HATE ALL OF THIS.

28:28.834 --> 28:30.375
GOD, I HATE YOU
FOR KISSING ME

28:30.375 --> 28:33.125
AND FORCING ME TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT IT ALL MEANS, PACEY.

28:33.125 --> 28:37.083
AND I HATE YOU, DAWSON,
FOR FORCING ME TO MAKE
A CHOICE BETWEEN OUR FRIENDSHIP

28:37.083 --> 28:38.875
AND WHAT I MIGHT
HAVE HAD WITH HIM.

28:38.875 --> 28:40.875
AND I HATE MYSELF.
I MEAN,

28:40.875 --> 28:42.500
I WISH WE COULD GO BACK
TO THE WAY IT WAS.

28:42.500 --> 28:43.834
I WISH I COULD TAKE IT
ALL BACK, BUT I CAN'T.

28:43.834 --> 28:46.875
NOTHING IS WORTH
GOING THROUGH ALL THIS.

28:46.875 --> 28:49.458
NO ONE PERSON
IS WORTH THIS--

28:49.458 --> 28:53.333
NEITHER ONE OF YOU
AND ESPECIALLY NOT ME.

28:55.542 --> 28:57.000
ARE YOU HAPPY NOW?

29:26.458 --> 29:28.417
I'M GLAD
HE KISSED YOU.

29:31.875 --> 29:34.291
WELL, THAT MAKES
ONE OF US.

29:34.291 --> 29:35.375
I'M GLAD HE KISSED YOU,
BECAUSE IT FORCED ME

29:35.375 --> 29:39.250
TO DEAL WITH THE NOTION
OF LOSING YOU, JOEY,

29:39.250 --> 29:40.291
AND I CAN'T.

29:42.208 --> 29:45.417
I CAN'T LOSE YOU,
NOT NOW, NOT EVER.

29:45.417 --> 29:48.500
DAWSON,
I'M NO GOOD FOR YOU.

29:48.500 --> 29:50.750
I MEAN, LOOK AT THE WAY
YOU BEHAVED TODAY.

29:50.750 --> 29:52.708
I BEHAVED THE WAY I DID TODAY
BECAUSE I WAS THREATENED.

29:52.708 --> 29:55.250
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

29:55.250 --> 29:56.417
HONESTLY?

29:56.417 --> 29:58.875
I'M JUST TRYING TO BE
THE KIND OF GUY YOU WANT.

29:58.875 --> 30:01.333
WHAT KIND OF A GUY
IS THAT?

30:01.333 --> 30:05.792
WELL, YOU WENT FOR
A GUY WHO BEAT UP A BULLY
AND BOUGHT YOU A WALL.

30:05.792 --> 30:06.834
THAT'S NOT YOU.

30:06.834 --> 30:08.208
I KNOW.

30:08.208 --> 30:10.417
NO, IT'S NOT, JOEY,
BUT I--I--

30:10.417 --> 30:15.625
I'M TRYING TO SHOW YOU
HOW MUCH I WANT YOU
INSTEAD OF JUST TELLING YOU.

30:15.625 --> 30:18.667
YOU DON'T WANT ME, DAWSON.

30:18.667 --> 30:21.834
YOU SAID IT YOURSELF.
YOU JUST DON'T WANT
TO LOSE ME.

30:21.834 --> 30:24.583
OF COURSE I DON'T WANT
TO LOSE YOU, JOEY.

30:24.583 --> 30:28.041
I--I WANT YOU
MORE THAN I EVER HAVE.

30:28.041 --> 30:30.417
IF YOU REALLY FELT
THAT WAY ABOUT ME, DAWSON,

30:30.417 --> 30:33.792
THEN YOU WOULD REALIZE
THAT THE LAST THING
I NEED RIGHT NOW

30:33.792 --> 30:36.667
IS ANOTHER PERSON WITH
ROMANTIC INTENTIONS FOR ME.

30:36.667 --> 30:40.500
OK. WHAT DO YOU NEED?

30:42.458 --> 30:44.125
JO, WHAT DO YOU NEED?
I WILL DO ANYTHING.

30:44.125 --> 30:45.708
I'M WILLING TO DO ANYTHING.

30:45.708 --> 30:48.333
I NEED A FRIEND.

30:51.000 --> 30:54.708
SOMEONE WHO WILL BE THERE
FOR ME WITHOUT ANY AGENDA.

30:57.500 --> 30:59.166
THE PERSON
THAT YOU USED TO BE.

31:01.959 --> 31:04.041
THEN I'LL--
I'LL BE THERE FOR YOU.

31:04.041 --> 31:08.000
LET ME PROVE IT TO YOU.
LET ME SHOW YOU.

31:11.959 --> 31:13.166
JOEY?

31:18.083 --> 31:19.041
JO--

31:30.125 --> 31:31.708
P.A. Announcer:
TRAIN 54 TO NEW RALEIGH

31:31.708 --> 31:33.458
NOW DEPARTING ON TRACK 10.

31:33.458 --> 31:35.458
THAT'S YOU, MAN.

31:35.458 --> 31:37.875
YEP.

31:37.875 --> 31:39.917
WELL, BE SAFE,
BROTHER.

31:39.917 --> 31:41.667
I'LL DO MY BEST.

31:41.667 --> 31:45.083
SO, ANY ADVICE?

31:45.083 --> 31:46.542
UH, YEAH, YOU KNOW,

31:46.542 --> 31:48.708
AVOID PUBLIC NUDITY,

31:48.708 --> 31:49.917
STAY OFF DRUGS, TRY
NOT TO MURDER ANYBODY--

31:49.917 --> 31:53.333
THE OBVIOUS STUFF--
AND ONE LAST THING:

31:53.333 --> 31:55.208
DON'T SLEEP WITH
ANY OF YOUR TEACHERS.

31:55.208 --> 31:57.708
BELIEVE ME,
IT NEVER WORKS OUT
AS WELL AS YOU THINK.

31:57.708 --> 32:01.041
WITTER WORDS OF WISDOM.

32:01.041 --> 32:03.542
PRICELESS.

32:03.542 --> 32:04.625
HERE'S SOME FOR YOU.

32:04.625 --> 32:07.291
DON'T GIVE UP.

32:07.291 --> 32:07.834
GIVE UP?

32:07.834 --> 32:09.875
ON TRUE LOVE.

32:09.875 --> 32:12.667
IT ALWAYS WINS IN THE END.

32:15.792 --> 32:16.250
HEY, BE GOOD, MAN.

32:24.083 --> 32:25.041
[KNOCK KNOCK]

32:33.500 --> 32:36.333
YOU MIGHT NOT RESPECT
ME OR THE DECISIONS
THAT I'VE MADE,

32:36.333 --> 32:38.458
BUT THE LEAST THAT
YOU CAN DO IS RESPECT
MY PRIVACY.

32:38.458 --> 32:39.667
I--I--I JUST--

32:39.667 --> 32:43.291
I JUST WANTED
TO BRING YOU THIS.

32:44.250 --> 32:47.125
WHY ARE YOU
GIVING THIS TO ME?

32:47.125 --> 32:50.500
I-I'VE BEEN DOING
A GREAT DEAL OF REFLECTION,

32:50.500 --> 32:51.667
LOOKING THROUGH
OLD PHOTOGRAPHS,

32:51.667 --> 32:55.625
AND I CAME ACROSS THIS DRESS
PACKED AWAY IN A BOX.

32:55.625 --> 32:58.041
IT WAS PACKED AWAY
FOR A REASON.

32:58.041 --> 32:59.208
IT'S NOT MY STYLE.

32:59.208 --> 33:00.542
I KNOW.

33:02.458 --> 33:08.000
JUST LOOKING AT IT REMINDS ME
HOW MUCH YOU'VE GROWN UP.

33:08.000 --> 33:12.667
WHEN YOU FIRST
CAME HERE TO LIVE,
YOU WERE STILL A CHILD.

33:12.667 --> 33:14.291
AND NOW?

33:14.291 --> 33:17.125
NOW YOU KNOW MORE.

33:17.125 --> 33:23.708
YOU'VE BECOME A BEAUTIFUL,
POISED, CONFIDENT,
MATURE YOUNG WOMAN

33:23.708 --> 33:26.291
WHO ISN'T AFRAID
TO RISK HER HEART,

33:26.291 --> 33:30.250
AND I THINK YOU
FINALLY BELIEVE,

33:30.250 --> 33:34.792
AFTER ALL THIS TIME,
THAT YOU REALLY DO
DESERVE TO BE LOVED.

33:34.792 --> 33:36.625
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

33:36.625 --> 33:39.750
I-I'VE SEEN THE AFFECTION
YOU HAVE FOR HENRY

33:39.750 --> 33:41.333
AND THE AFFECTION
HE HAS FOR YOU.

33:41.333 --> 33:43.667
GRAMS--
AND I'M NOT
SO OLD

33:43.667 --> 33:47.041
THAT I DON'T REMEMBER HOW
TRULY DIFFICULT IT IS TO WAIT

33:47.041 --> 33:48.083
WHEN YOU'VE FOUND SOMEONE
WHO GIVES YOU THE LOVE

33:48.083 --> 33:50.500
YOU SO MUCH
DESERVE--
GRAMS--

33:50.500 --> 33:53.542
AND I KNOW YOU THINK
YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT

33:53.542 --> 33:55.917
THE BIRDS AND THE BEES,
BUT WHAT I WANT TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT

33:55.917 --> 33:58.208
IS NOT ONLY THE JOY OF SEX

33:58.208 --> 34:00.250
BUT THE RESPONSIBILITY
OF BIRTH CONTROL.

34:00.250 --> 34:03.917
GRAMS, HENRY AND I
DIDN'T HAVE SEX.

34:03.917 --> 34:05.875
OK?

34:05.875 --> 34:08.000
I MEAN, WE--WE LITERALLY
SLEPT TOGETHER,

34:08.000 --> 34:13.208
BUT, UM,
WE DIDN'T HAVE SEX.

34:13.208 --> 34:14.542
OH.

34:18.333 --> 34:24.458
OH, YOU DON'T KNOW HOW GLAD
I AM TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT.

34:24.458 --> 34:27.625
WELL, NOW THAT YOU KNOW
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED...

34:29.958 --> 34:32.000
DO YOU STILL MEAN
THE STUFF YOU JUST SAID?

34:32.000 --> 34:34.291
EVERY WORD OF IT.

34:48.333 --> 34:51.583
I THOUGHT THERE WAS
A PRIVATE PARTY TONIGHT.

34:51.583 --> 34:52.583
THERE IS.

34:52.583 --> 34:53.375
OURS.

34:58.083 --> 34:59.417
WHAT'S GOING ON?

34:59.417 --> 35:00.750
WELL, I THOUGHT ABOUT
WHAT YOU SAID

35:00.750 --> 35:02.417
ABOUT WHAT'S
BEEN HAPPENING
AROUND HERE LATELY,

35:02.417 --> 35:06.583
AND I DECIDED THAT
WE SHOULD HAVE DINNER

35:06.583 --> 35:09.250
AND FIGURE
A FEW THINGS OUT.

35:09.250 --> 35:11.333
BUT WHAT ABOUT BUSINESS?

35:11.333 --> 35:12.750
OUR CUSTOMERS?

35:12.750 --> 35:15.000
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT
WEEKEND FOR US.

35:15.000 --> 35:16.291
MM-HMM.

35:16.291 --> 35:18.708
YOU'RE MORE IMPORTANT.

35:18.708 --> 35:21.208
YOU ALWAYS WERE.

35:21.208 --> 35:22.250
YOU ALWAYS WILL BE.

35:27.417 --> 35:29.667
AREN'T YOU GONNA
SAY SOMETHING?

35:33.542 --> 35:35.959
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO FIND THE WORDS.

36:02.500 --> 36:04.542
HEY.

36:07.125 --> 36:08.041
HEY.

36:08.041 --> 36:09.667
YOU THOUGHT
I WAS DAWSON?

36:09.667 --> 36:10.542
NO, I JUST DIDN'T--

36:10.542 --> 36:12.166
MAYBE THE BETTER
QUESTION WOULD BE

36:12.166 --> 36:14.917
DID YOU WANT ME
TO BE DAWSON?

36:14.917 --> 36:17.083
I'M SORRY.

36:17.083 --> 36:18.875
I TAKE THAT BACK.

36:21.834 --> 36:24.208
WELL, THE LEASE
IS GONNA BE UP SOON.

36:24.208 --> 36:25.375
I'LL RENEW IT AGAIN
IF YOU WANT ME TO.

36:28.750 --> 36:30.166
I--I DON'T KNOW, PACEY.

36:30.166 --> 36:32.792
I MEAN, I DON'T WANT
TO GIVE IT UP.

36:32.792 --> 36:35.917
IT JUST THAT I DON'T REALLY
FEEL LIKE I'M READY TO...

36:35.917 --> 36:37.125
PAINT?

36:41.583 --> 36:42.792
YEAH.

36:48.458 --> 36:52.333
I GOTTA BE HONEST
WITH YOU, JO.

36:52.333 --> 36:54.542
I REALLY THOUGHT
AFTER THE WAY
HE BEHAVED TODAY

36:54.542 --> 36:57.375
THAT YOU'D LOVE HIM LESS,
BUT YOU DON'T, DO YOU?

36:57.375 --> 37:01.000
IF ANYTHING,
YOU JUST LOVE HIM MORE.

37:03.708 --> 37:05.375
PACEY.

37:05.375 --> 37:08.417
PLEASE DON'T MAKE THIS
HARDER THAN IT IS.

37:10.208 --> 37:12.750
OK.

37:12.750 --> 37:14.208
OK. I JUST GOTTA ASK
ONE MORE QUESTION,

37:14.208 --> 37:18.625
AND THEN I'M GONNA
STOP MAKING THIS HARD
ON BOTH OF US, I SWEAR.

37:18.625 --> 37:21.875
IF IT WEREN'T
FOR DAWSON,

37:21.875 --> 37:24.792
COULD YOU EVER
LOVE ME LIKE THAT?

37:24.792 --> 37:27.792
LIKE WHAT?

37:27.792 --> 37:30.583
LIKE A SOULMATE.

37:35.750 --> 37:37.750
PACEY, PLEASE DON'T
MAKE ME DO THIS.

37:37.750 --> 37:38.625
DON'T MAKE ME CHOOSE.

37:38.625 --> 37:40.750
I REALLY THINK
THE BEST THING IS--

37:40.750 --> 37:44.583
IS JUST TO TAKE
A COUPLE STEPS BACK AND...

37:44.583 --> 37:45.583
YEAH.

37:52.792 --> 37:54.667
LOOK, JO...

37:57.166 --> 37:59.625
I'LL RENEW THE LEASE
ON THE WALL FIRST THING
TOMORROW MORNING.

37:59.625 --> 38:00.875
OK.

38:00.875 --> 38:05.291
AND I UNDERSTAND.

38:05.291 --> 38:06.458
I DO. I UNDERSTAND.

38:06.458 --> 38:07.583
THERE ARE
NO ULTIMATUMS HERE.

38:43.542 --> 38:45.834
[SPLASH]

38:53.583 --> 38:54.583
[CLEARS THROAT]

38:56.375 --> 38:58.708
I HAVE SOMETHING
I NEED TO TELL YOU.

38:58.708 --> 39:02.125
I ALREADY KNOW
YOU HATE ME, ANDIE.

39:02.125 --> 39:04.667
HEY, I JUST DON'T THINK
I COULD HEAR IT TONIGHT.

39:04.667 --> 39:08.208
OK, COULD YOU
JUST STOP?

39:08.208 --> 39:10.041
I NEED TO SAY
SOMETHING.

39:12.166 --> 39:13.708
LOOK,
I DON'T HATE YOU.

39:13.708 --> 39:15.917
OK?

39:18.500 --> 39:22.792
I MEAN, I'VE FELT
HURT AND BETRAYED,

39:22.792 --> 39:25.333
AND IT WOULD BE
REALLY, REALLY EASY

39:25.333 --> 39:26.667
TO TURN ALL THAT
ANGER INTO HATE.

39:29.500 --> 39:32.667
I DON'T WANT TO CARRY
AROUND THAT BURDEN, OK?

39:32.667 --> 39:35.417
THAT'S NOT THE PERSON
THAT I WANT TO BE.

39:35.417 --> 39:37.500
IT'S NOT THE PERSON
THAT I AM.

39:37.500 --> 39:39.708
SO I DON'T HATE YOU.

39:44.250 --> 39:45.750
THANK YOU, ANDIE.

39:49.708 --> 39:52.792
YOU KNOW, HATE'S A PRETTY
STRONG WORD, PACEY.

39:55.208 --> 39:57.291
SO IS LOVE.

40:06.125 --> 40:08.166
[TAP]

40:09.542 --> 40:11.166
DOES THE INVITATION
STILL STAND?

40:11.166 --> 40:14.834
YEAH. YEAH, OF COURSE.

40:20.750 --> 40:21.917
E.T.?

40:23.417 --> 40:25.208
AFTER EVERYTHING
THAT'S HAPPENED,

40:25.208 --> 40:26.166
THIS IS WHAT
YOU RENTED?

40:26.166 --> 40:30.250
I THOUGHT IT WAS TIME
TO SEE IT AGAIN.

40:32.083 --> 40:34.625
YOU ALWAYS SAID
THIS MOVIE WAS SAD
AND DEPRESSING, REMEMBER?

40:34.625 --> 40:37.625
I JUST FEEL LIKE WATCHING
SOMETHING TONIGHT

40:37.625 --> 40:39.834
WITH AN ENDING THAT I KNOW
LIKE THE BACK OF MY HAND.

40:41.750 --> 40:43.291
YOU MEAN WHEN E.T.
TURNS TO ELLIOT

40:43.291 --> 40:45.000
AND SAYS,
"I'LL BE RIGHT HERE?"

40:45.000 --> 40:49.166
UM, RIGHT NOW,

40:49.166 --> 40:52.041
THOSE ARE SOME OF THE MOST
COMFORTING WORDS IN THE WORLD.
