WEBVTT

00:11.345 --> 00:12.346
Ellen?

00:17.726 --> 00:18.810
Ellen?

00:29.863 --> 00:31.114
Ellen?

00:32.658 --> 00:33.659
Deke?

00:33.742 --> 00:35.661
Ellen, you're alive. Thank God.

00:35.744 --> 00:37.663
You've been out for almost six minutes.

00:37.746 --> 00:40.123
I'm... I'm here.

00:40.541 --> 00:42.501
You need to abort the burn.

00:43.335 --> 00:45.170
I don't have much left in my OPS.

00:45.963 --> 00:47.548
There's a puncture in my suit.

00:53.720 --> 00:54.721
Shit.

01:00.811 --> 01:03.647
Houston,
our abort handle is non-responsive.

01:06.149 --> 01:07.317
Houston, do you read?

01:07.401 --> 01:10.112
I've been trying. I can't raise them.

01:11.321 --> 01:12.364
Shit.

01:19.413 --> 01:20.455
Harry!

02:32.110 --> 02:33.320
Keep pressure on it.

03:00.138 --> 03:04.518
Houston, our S-IVB's fuel is depleted.
Do you copy?

03:09.398 --> 03:12.985
Houston. Do you read, Houston?

03:16.530 --> 03:17.823
Houston, do you read?

03:19.616 --> 03:21.118
Do you read, Houston?

04:31.813 --> 04:34.191
Is there hope for any sort of, uh, rescue?

04:34.691 --> 04:37.027
That is... unclear at the moment,
Mr. President.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.487
What happened up there, Harold?

04:38.570 --> 04:39.696
Well, sir, it's, uh--

04:39.780 --> 04:44.034
We're going over everything leading up
to Apollo 24's booster ignition

04:44.117 --> 04:46.036
and it seems like the replacement computer

04:46.119 --> 04:49.206
may have mistakenly thought the ship
was still in its first--

04:49.289 --> 04:52.251
rather, uh, initial orbit
and booted up for the--

04:52.334 --> 04:53.710
Could this be connected to the Soviets?

04:53.794 --> 04:54.837
Sabotage, or...

04:54.920 --> 04:57.631
I-- I'm not saying that necessarily,
sir, I--

04:57.714 --> 04:59.550
What in the goddamn hell
are you saying, Harold?

04:59.633 --> 05:01.635
I-It's complicated, sir.

05:01.718 --> 05:04.805
No, it isn't! You've had three
goddamn accidents in as many months!

05:04.888 --> 05:07.474
What kind of chickenshit operation
are you running down there?

05:07.558 --> 05:08.892
I do not need this right now.

05:08.976 --> 05:10.477
Already got Ronnie Reagan up my ass.

05:10.811 --> 05:13.105
Him and his whole "America was better
way back when" thing...

05:13.730 --> 05:15.482
What does he even remember way back when?

05:15.566 --> 05:16.608
Jim Crow?

05:16.692 --> 05:18.694
The Depression? Vietnam?

05:18.986 --> 05:20.195
It wasn't that great, let me tell you.

05:20.821 --> 05:22.281
I don't care what you have to do.

05:22.364 --> 05:25.200
You get those astronauts back home.
You hear me, Harold?

05:44.720 --> 05:46.889
English. I know you learn it.

05:47.973 --> 05:49.016
You all do.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.852
See, I know a lot about you guys.
I was in Korea.

05:54.897 --> 05:58.192
You cut off my oxygen. Really?

06:01.862 --> 06:03.864
What were you doing in our mine, Ivan?

06:04.865 --> 06:06.575
What were you looking for?

06:07.659 --> 06:08.785
Nothing.

06:20.506 --> 06:21.840
What's this for then?

06:27.554 --> 06:30.974
What was it for,
that device you left in our mine?

06:31.850 --> 06:32.976
The one you destroyed.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.478
Yeah, you put it in our territory.

06:34.561 --> 06:36.021
-Your territory?
-Yeah.

06:36.104 --> 06:39.149
That's funny. Your territory, your mine.

06:39.233 --> 06:42.361
This is the moon, mister.
Belongs to everyone.

06:43.278 --> 06:46.448
Molly Cobb and I discovered ice there
over three years ago.

06:46.532 --> 06:48.283
Yeah, if it's about who was here first,

06:48.367 --> 06:52.246
Alexei Leonov was here before you,
Edward... Baldwin.

06:57.084 --> 06:59.711
And he said
moon belonged to the whole world.

07:00.128 --> 07:03.465
I seem to remember him saying something
about "the Marxist-Leninist way of life."

07:04.383 --> 07:05.592
Look...

07:08.428 --> 07:09.680
you want ice.

07:10.556 --> 07:11.723
So do we.

07:12.558 --> 07:15.435
There is enough ice for everyone.

07:18.063 --> 07:20.607
Why don't you tell me
what you're building over there at Zvezda?

07:20.691 --> 07:22.568
I've seen all the regolith
you're kicking up.

07:23.735 --> 07:25.362
What are you building over there?

07:25.445 --> 07:26.738
I can't tell you.

07:27.406 --> 07:28.949
Didn't think so.

07:29.032 --> 07:32.911
You need to let me go. My compatriots
will be looking for me soon.

07:33.662 --> 07:36.915
Yeah, well, see, I'm not that concerned
about your compatriots 'cause...

07:40.085 --> 07:42.713
I know you've got one rover, just like us.

07:42.796 --> 07:44.006
And it's over here.

07:44.089 --> 07:48.802
So... if your compatriots
wanted to come looking for you,

07:48.886 --> 07:51.180
they wouldn't get very far, now,
would they, Ivan?

07:52.306 --> 07:53.557
Guess not.

07:54.558 --> 07:55.559
Guess not.

08:06.111 --> 08:07.154
500 feet.

08:09.865 --> 08:11.074
300 feet.

08:14.119 --> 08:16.288
Apollo 25 splashdown.

08:20.125 --> 08:21.710
Roger that, 25.

08:23.045 --> 08:24.338
Condition of the crew?

08:24.421 --> 08:27.966
I'm good, the astro wife is smiling,
and Dennis is seasick.

08:28.050 --> 08:31.261
GUIDO,
give me a situation report on Apollo 24.

08:31.929 --> 08:33.847
Still got no communication, Flight.

08:33.931 --> 08:37.433
No telemetry, no bio-readings.
Only able to track 'em on radar.

08:37.518 --> 08:39.937
Jesus, we don't even know
if they're alive, do we?

08:40.020 --> 08:44.191
All we know is that
they're headed toward... deep space.

08:52.574 --> 08:55.953
Wish we could talk to Houston,
find out what the hell happened.

08:56.036 --> 08:58.622
The long-range S-band
must've been damaged during the burn.

08:58.997 --> 09:01.959
We're way past short-range VHF.

09:02.042 --> 09:06.046
I sure am glad they upgraded
these goddamn comm systems last year.

09:06.129 --> 09:08.423
Guarantee you,
we were still using the old output buffer,

09:08.507 --> 09:11.093
none of this happens,
and we're back on our way to Ed.

09:11.593 --> 09:14.263
Maybe so, but you need to calm down.

09:14.930 --> 09:16.932
It's not good for you to get so worked up.

09:17.933 --> 09:21.061
And I need you focused
if we're gonna pull this off.

09:21.812 --> 09:23.063
Pull what off?

09:23.146 --> 09:25.691
With that overburn, we're miles off course

09:25.774 --> 09:28.402
and going way too fast
to enter lunar orbit.

09:29.820 --> 09:31.280
You think you're up for another burn?

09:40.664 --> 09:41.790
You saw.

09:45.210 --> 09:46.336
I mean, Harry.

09:49.298 --> 09:52.593
He got dragged into the plume.
Swallowed him whole.

09:58.891 --> 10:00.893
We'll have to ditch the cargo.

10:00.976 --> 10:02.936
Gonna need just about
all the fuel we've got left

10:03.020 --> 10:05.606
to get our velocity down to
35,650 feet per second.

10:06.315 --> 10:08.275
The margin's gonna be...

10:10.235 --> 10:13.197
Well... there won't be a margin.

10:14.573 --> 10:15.782
Well, it's either that...

10:16.617 --> 10:19.369
or we're on our way to Jupiter
and Ed stays stranded.

10:19.453 --> 10:23.332
So what are we waiting for? You want me
on the computer or the sextant?

10:25.459 --> 10:27.294
Let's dump the dead weight first.

10:27.377 --> 10:29.963
Be my pleasure
to get rid of that fucking thing.

10:31.840 --> 10:34.176
SMRCS-iso valves are all gray.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.470
CSM separating.

10:37.471 --> 10:38.680
Sayonara.

10:40.807 --> 10:43.060
...prolonged communication failure,

10:43.143 --> 10:48.273
likely caused by physical damage to
the command-service module's antennae.

10:48.357 --> 10:51.485
His hope is that whatever event
damaged the antennae

10:51.568 --> 10:55.155
did not also damage the fuel tanks
or guidance systems.

10:55.239 --> 10:56.740
Aleida!

10:56.823 --> 10:58.492
...ended on an optimistic note,

10:58.575 --> 11:01.662
saying that astronauts
are "a different breed.

11:01.745 --> 11:03.205
They train together tirelessly..."

11:03.288 --> 11:05.749
-¿Papá?
-Aleida, are you okay?

11:06.375 --> 11:08.585
Yeah, I'm fine. Where are you?

11:08.669 --> 11:10.170
My hearing was this morning.

11:12.214 --> 11:14.132
They say they're gonna
send me back to Mexico.

11:14.216 --> 11:16.218
What do you mean? They can't.

11:16.301 --> 11:19.346
I'm sorry, Aleida, I...
I should have been more careful.

11:20.347 --> 11:21.682
But don't worry, I talked to Cata,

11:21.765 --> 11:25.060
and she said you can still stay there
and keep going to school.

11:25.143 --> 11:26.520
I will send her money.

11:27.145 --> 11:28.730
I don't wanna stay with her.

11:28.814 --> 11:29.982
When will you be back?

11:30.065 --> 11:31.441
I don't know, mija.

11:32.484 --> 11:35.654
They say if they catch me again,
they can send me to prison.

11:36.947 --> 11:38.824
But you don't worry, mija, hey.

11:38.907 --> 11:41.535
Everything is going to be okay.
I promise you.

11:41.618 --> 11:42.870
Te quiero, mija.

11:43.829 --> 11:44.872
Te quiero, papá.

11:49.585 --> 11:51.628
And now, we bring you live
to the press conference

11:51.712 --> 11:53.547
at Houston's Johnson Space Center,

11:53.630 --> 11:56.091
where head of the astronaut office,
Buzz Aldrin,

11:56.175 --> 11:57.593
and administrator Harold Weisner

11:57.676 --> 11:59.887
are discussing the crisis in space.

12:01.430 --> 12:04.308
Astronaut Liu is survived
by his wife, Cecilia,

12:04.391 --> 12:05.684
and their two daughters.

12:05.767 --> 12:07.769
He was a good man. And a good father.

12:07.853 --> 12:09.563
-Gentlemen, hey, hey!
-Front row.

12:09.646 --> 12:13.567
Mr. Aldrin, what about the status of
Commander Wilson and Deke Slayton?

12:13.984 --> 12:15.194
What we know right now

12:15.277 --> 12:19.573
is that an unexpected firing
of Apollo 24's stage-IVB engine

12:19.656 --> 12:23.285
performed the translunar injection burn
earlier than planned.

12:23.368 --> 12:24.369
Gentlemen, gentlemen!

12:24.453 --> 12:26.038
Mr. Weisner, Mr. Weisner!

12:26.121 --> 12:29.499
Sources are saying there's been talk of
possible Soviet sabotage in the...

12:29.583 --> 12:32.419
Okay, no, no, no, no.
Those are unfounded rumors.

12:32.503 --> 12:34.213
Then what caused the engine to fire?

12:34.546 --> 12:36.131
We're looking into that.

12:36.215 --> 12:37.758
Are they headed for the moon?

12:39.092 --> 12:41.470
We cannot comment on that at this time.

12:49.603 --> 12:53.315
Attitude looking good.
Trajectory converging.

12:53.941 --> 12:55.400
Helium pressure holding.

12:55.692 --> 12:56.693
Okay.

12:57.152 --> 12:59.571
Good on trajectory,
now let's put on the brakes.

12:59.655 --> 13:01.949
Configuring DAP for braking burn.

13:06.328 --> 13:08.789
We're a long way from 35,650.

13:11.917 --> 13:14.628
Still over 36,000 feet per second.

13:15.504 --> 13:17.840
We're not gonna have enough gas
in the SPS to make it.

13:17.923 --> 13:20.425
Goddamn it. We need to use the RCS.

13:21.593 --> 13:22.845
Switching to manual.

13:23.262 --> 13:26.265
We burn through that,
we won't be able to control the vehicle.

13:26.348 --> 13:29.351
-We'll be dead in the water.
-It's better than missing the moon.

13:29.434 --> 13:32.563
All right,
firing all four RCS thrusters plus-X.

13:41.822 --> 13:42.948
Five seconds.

13:43.031 --> 13:45.492
Come on. Come on.

13:46.076 --> 13:48.912
Shit. RCS depleted.

13:48.996 --> 13:51.874
SPS at three, two, one.

13:59.131 --> 14:00.257
We didn't make it.

14:01.216 --> 14:03.093
By 30 fucking feet.

14:09.099 --> 14:10.684
Yes, and thank you, sir.

14:10.767 --> 14:12.936
Yeah, it certainly is a Christmas miracle.

14:14.188 --> 14:16.773
We're all very happy over here.

14:21.111 --> 14:23.405
-What's happening?
-They're alive.

14:23.488 --> 14:25.866
They've corrected their trajectory
towards the moon.

14:33.999 --> 14:37.002
Okay, I will keep you updated
as the situation progresses.

14:37.085 --> 14:38.504
All right. Thanks again.

15:01.527 --> 15:05.489
To enter orbit, you not only have to be
going exactly the right direction,

15:05.572 --> 15:08.867
you have to be moving
at exactly the right speed.

15:09.368 --> 15:12.037
If you're even one mile per hour over,

15:12.120 --> 15:14.706
lunar gravity won't hold onto the craft.

15:20.504 --> 15:22.881
It's like a marble going past a drain.

15:22.965 --> 15:25.342
It's going too fast,
it'll just shoot right by.

15:25.801 --> 15:28.095
Okay, so they just need to
slow themselves down, right?

15:28.595 --> 15:32.474
By our calculations, they've used
all their fuel just to get to this point.

15:34.977 --> 15:37.813
Well, then, I guess
I'll just call the president back

15:37.896 --> 15:39.481
in the middle of his Christmas dinner

15:39.565 --> 15:43.443
and let him know that, once again,
our good news has turned into shit.

15:43.861 --> 15:46.738
I might hold off on that call, sir.

15:47.573 --> 15:49.616
Why? Is there some way to slow them down?

15:49.700 --> 15:53.287
No. But there may be something
Ed Baldwin can do.

16:00.919 --> 16:04.882
I've been sending a message every
30 minutes for the last three days, sir.

16:04.965 --> 16:06.175
He's just refusing to answer.

16:07.968 --> 16:10.637
Well, then send one every ten. Understood?

16:13.807 --> 16:16.185
There's got to be another way
to reach him.

16:35.204 --> 16:37.414
Can I have some water, please?

16:38.874 --> 16:43.128
Sure. Soon as you tell me
what you're building over there at Zvezda.

16:50.427 --> 16:54.097
Edward, what is your plan?

16:56.099 --> 16:57.100
My what?

16:57.893 --> 17:01.230
Your plan. What is your strategy?

17:04.483 --> 17:06.608
You didn't tell Houston about me. Why?

17:07.444 --> 17:08.987
I'm commander of this base.

17:09.069 --> 17:13.116
It's within my discretion to withhold
information when I deem necessary.

17:13.200 --> 17:16.993
You haven't communicated with them
in days before I came here.

17:20.374 --> 17:23.377
-So, you're monitoring my communications?
-Of course.

17:23.877 --> 17:26.046
Same way you are monitoring ours.

17:29.466 --> 17:34.805
I've been away from my station for,
what, 37 hours?

17:36.598 --> 17:39.226
My oxygen would have depleted by now.

17:40.561 --> 17:43.188
My crew thinks I'm dead.

17:44.022 --> 17:46.817
They will call my wife, tell her I'm dead.

17:47.860 --> 17:50.362
She will tell my daughter I'm dead.

17:52.614 --> 17:54.116
This part of your plan?

17:56.660 --> 17:58.078
I know you hear me.

17:58.161 --> 17:59.746
You're a father too.

18:03.584 --> 18:06.920
Look, I know it's not the same,

18:07.004 --> 18:11.300
but... when my Sveta was born,

18:12.134 --> 18:13.552
she was sick.

18:13.635 --> 18:15.095
She was very ill.

18:15.929 --> 18:17.931
Seven days she was in hospital.

18:18.932 --> 18:24.897
Poked with needles and put into machines
over and over and over again.

18:24.980 --> 18:27.941
Such a tiny body. So helpless.

18:28.692 --> 18:30.110
And you are helpless.

18:31.904 --> 18:33.363
She's ten now.

18:34.948 --> 18:37.075
Still goes to hospital every month.

18:38.160 --> 18:41.747
Now,
they will tell her her father is dead.

18:45.709 --> 18:48.378
Yeah, well,
that's a really touching story, Ivan.

18:49.713 --> 18:52.799
So you have a sick kid,
and now you and me can become pals.

18:53.842 --> 18:55.010
That's really good.

18:56.136 --> 18:57.638
KGB cook up that whole story,

18:57.721 --> 19:00.307
or did you sprinkle in
some details of your own?

19:00.390 --> 19:02.392
I would never lie about my family.

19:03.477 --> 19:09.316
Well, I wouldn't fault you.
You gotta follow orders, right?

19:09.399 --> 19:11.610
Is that what you do? Follow orders?

19:13.570 --> 19:14.738
I don't think so.

19:14.821 --> 19:18.033
Edward Baldwin doesn't follow orders.

19:18.116 --> 19:22.204
No, he's a real American cowboy, right?

19:22.287 --> 19:24.581
White hat and loyal horse. Good guy.

19:24.665 --> 19:26.750
I'd stop talking if I were you, Ivan.

19:27.292 --> 19:32.130
My name is Mikhail.
Mikhail Mikhailovich Vasiliev.

19:32.214 --> 19:35.551
And I ask you again... what is your plan?

19:35.634 --> 19:37.302
Or maybe you don't have a plan.

19:37.386 --> 19:40.889
Maybe you charge into this
without thinking it through.

19:41.723 --> 19:42.724
Okay.

19:44.685 --> 19:47.104
Let's see what your options are.

19:47.980 --> 19:52.359
If you let me go back to Zvezda,
I will have to say where I was.

19:52.442 --> 19:55.153
That's not very good for United States.

19:57.030 --> 19:59.283
But you also cannot keep me here, right?

19:59.366 --> 20:01.785
You have that resupply mission en route.

20:02.327 --> 20:06.164
What will they think
if they see cosmonaut tied to a chair?

20:06.248 --> 20:07.666
No, that's not...

20:08.584 --> 20:10.961
There is one way out of this.

20:11.837 --> 20:16.967
Poor cosmonaut...
died on the surface all by himself.

20:18.468 --> 20:20.387
Who knows what happened?

20:20.470 --> 20:22.347
Maybe tore his suit on rover.

20:22.431 --> 20:24.516
Maybe fell into crater.

20:25.309 --> 20:28.770
Discovered by great American hero.

20:30.105 --> 20:31.398
But it was too late.

20:32.733 --> 20:34.568
What a tragedy.

20:35.736 --> 20:37.738
Maybe you already thought about this?

20:39.656 --> 20:41.158
I'm not gonna kill you, Ivan.

20:41.533 --> 20:43.952
Of course not. You are America.

20:44.411 --> 20:46.580
And America is good.

20:47.831 --> 20:49.541
America is kind.

20:50.667 --> 20:54.129
America saves the world
from evil Soviet empire.

20:54.213 --> 20:56.089
-Shut up.
-But you know what, Edward?

20:56.590 --> 21:00.010
I've seen real America. Oh, yes.

21:00.886 --> 21:05.182
I have seen bodies of babies
and women and children

21:05.265 --> 21:08.018
ripped apart by good American bombs.

21:08.101 --> 21:11.897
-Shut up.
-In Cambodia, Dresden.

21:11.980 --> 21:13.273
-I said shut up.
-Hiroshima.

21:13.357 --> 21:15.025
-I said shut up!
-Korea.

21:17.152 --> 21:18.320
This is you.

21:18.403 --> 21:20.656
-This is America!
-I said shut up!

21:23.575 --> 21:24.660
Goddamn it!

21:33.168 --> 21:34.169
Shit.

21:41.844 --> 21:44.680
Oh, I'm sorry. I...

21:45.556 --> 21:47.307
God, Aleida, I'm...

21:48.475 --> 21:51.395
I heard about your father. Is he okay?

21:52.479 --> 21:53.772
Have you heard from him?

21:55.607 --> 21:58.861
What did he say?
Is there gonna be a hearing or...

21:59.945 --> 22:01.780
They're sending him back to Mexico.

22:15.169 --> 22:16.378
It's...

22:23.510 --> 22:25.012
It's gonna be okay.

22:26.972 --> 22:28.849
Your father is a smart man.

22:29.766 --> 22:31.143
He'll figure something out.

22:32.895 --> 22:37.482
He... talked to the woman we live with.

22:38.609 --> 22:40.944
Said I could stay there,

22:41.695 --> 22:42.988
keep going to school.

22:43.614 --> 22:47.868
Okay. Good. I think that's good.

22:50.621 --> 22:52.456
I don't wanna live with her.

22:53.957 --> 22:55.125
Well...

22:59.338 --> 23:02.549
it's only temporary.

23:03.717 --> 23:07.638
I'm sure you'll figure something else out
at some point.

23:10.766 --> 23:11.808
Maybe...

23:13.143 --> 23:16.146
Maybe I... could stay with you.

23:20.234 --> 23:21.235
I don't know.

23:23.070 --> 23:24.112
I...

23:25.572 --> 23:29.576
I promise I won't be a bother.
You won't even notice I'm there.

23:29.910 --> 23:31.537
Aleida, it...

23:32.162 --> 23:33.956
My father, he trusts you.

23:34.039 --> 23:36.208
He says I should listen to you.

23:37.960 --> 23:39.044
Please.

23:41.630 --> 23:43.340
I'm sorry. I just...

23:44.716 --> 23:47.010
It's a lot to ask, Aleida.

23:48.053 --> 23:49.555
My life's not...

23:50.472 --> 23:53.809
Well, this job, it's all-consuming.

23:54.560 --> 23:57.271
You have to understand, I can't just...

23:57.354 --> 24:00.732
I know. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked.

24:00.816 --> 24:05.279
Well, we can still do our sessions,
but I...

24:36.977 --> 24:39.813
Cata? Gabriel?

24:41.356 --> 24:42.357
Livi?

25:14.723 --> 25:16.642
-Hello?
-Aleida, where were you?

25:17.100 --> 25:18.602
I've been calling all day.

25:18.685 --> 25:20.521
The apartment... They're all gone.

25:20.604 --> 25:22.689
Gone? What do you mean, gone?

25:22.773 --> 25:24.399
I think the police were here.

25:25.192 --> 25:26.318
Aleida.

25:26.652 --> 25:27.653
Listen to me.

25:27.736 --> 25:30.531
Grab everything you can take with you

25:30.781 --> 25:31.949
and get out of there.

25:32.032 --> 25:34.326
-Never go back.
-But, papá--

25:34.409 --> 25:36.370
You'll have to come to Mexico.

25:36.453 --> 25:40.040
I'm going to figure out a way
to send you money...

25:40.999 --> 25:43.919
so you can buy a bus ticket.

25:44.002 --> 25:45.963
No. I'm not going to leave.

25:46.046 --> 25:48.423
What?
Aleida, this better not be about that boy.

25:48.507 --> 25:50.968
It's not. I talked to Ms. Madison.

25:52.302 --> 25:55.389
She said I could stay with her.

25:56.139 --> 25:57.558
What, she said that?

25:59.601 --> 26:00.602
Yes.

26:05.649 --> 26:06.775
¿Papá?

26:06.859 --> 26:09.111
I'm sorry.

26:09.194 --> 26:11.989
That's... great news!

26:13.490 --> 26:14.491
It's just that...

26:16.285 --> 26:18.287
the idea of being separated from you...

26:18.370 --> 26:19.371
I'll be fine.

26:19.997 --> 26:21.081
I know.

26:21.164 --> 26:22.791
Please be careful.

26:22.875 --> 26:25.586
And don't bother Ms. Madison too much.

26:26.837 --> 26:28.255
She's a very good person.

26:28.589 --> 26:30.716
I will call you when I make it to Parras.

26:31.341 --> 26:33.051
-I have to go, papá.
-Check upstairs!

26:33.135 --> 26:34.553
I love you, Aleida.

26:34.636 --> 26:35.888
Love you too.

27:04.791 --> 27:07.878
You know, it's not the worst way to go.

27:13.800 --> 27:14.927
Which?

27:15.636 --> 27:21.266
Because right now we can pick
from suffocation, starvation...

27:22.309 --> 27:23.727
Cannibalism.

27:31.902 --> 27:35.072
Or we could just... open the hatch.

27:36.949 --> 27:38.283
I don't know.

27:40.369 --> 27:42.287
I kinda wanna see how far we'll get.

27:47.960 --> 27:51.421
Go farther in the universe
than anyone's ever gone.

27:51.505 --> 27:54.800
That's something, at least.

27:57.928 --> 27:59.054
I've alway--

28:13.318 --> 28:16.405
The staples are holding.
Looks like there's internal bleeding.

28:18.574 --> 28:19.575
Shit.

28:21.159 --> 28:23.704
Looks like you might get farther
in the universe than me.

28:24.079 --> 28:25.622
That's not funny, Deke.

28:27.666 --> 28:29.126
It makes sense.

28:29.960 --> 28:32.504
I always knew
you had a bit of John Glenn in you.

28:33.213 --> 28:36.049
I mean, yeah, you were quiet,

28:36.466 --> 28:38.093
a little hard on yourself,

28:38.802 --> 28:42.306
but when you walk into a room,
people pay attention.

28:43.849 --> 28:48.228
When you speak... people listen.

28:51.273 --> 28:52.858
A lot of good that'll do me now.

29:00.324 --> 29:04.703
You know those letters we're supposed to
write before we... you know?

29:05.871 --> 29:07.581
The "in case of my death" letter.

29:09.499 --> 29:10.626
I was...

29:11.877 --> 29:17.007
so distracted by mission prep, Ed...

29:18.926 --> 29:20.135
Suddenly it's launch day,

29:20.219 --> 29:25.557
and I got 'bout two and a half minutes
to think of something to write to Marge.

29:30.979 --> 29:32.272
I'm sure she'll understand.

29:38.153 --> 29:39.780
She deserved better.

29:42.199 --> 29:45.953
You know, for three months,
I lived on tomato soup.

29:47.496 --> 29:48.997
Breakfast, lunch and dinner.

29:50.707 --> 29:52.751
So I could save up enough for a ring.

29:54.002 --> 29:55.921
Almost 20 years later,

29:56.880 --> 30:01.552
and I can't believe that woman said yes.

30:04.555 --> 30:05.848
How about you?

30:07.683 --> 30:09.226
How'd Larry propose?

30:14.773 --> 30:17.776
It was very... really nice, actually.

30:19.695 --> 30:21.738
He took me to Memorial Park.

30:22.990 --> 30:25.075
I thought we were
just going for a picnic and...

30:26.368 --> 30:29.913
then I turned around
and there Larry was...

30:30.956 --> 30:32.165
down on one knee.

30:32.249 --> 30:33.250
And...

30:36.503 --> 30:37.504
he...

30:42.426 --> 30:43.844
You okay?

30:46.096 --> 30:47.097
Yeah.

30:50.267 --> 30:51.935
I just don't know what I'm doing.

30:52.394 --> 30:56.565
I mean, here we are,
headed to God-knows-where, and--

30:58.692 --> 30:59.818
I'm still...

31:09.494 --> 31:13.040
It's just, Larry, he...

31:18.378 --> 31:22.466
Our marriage, it...

31:27.346 --> 31:30.933
I knew...
if I wanted to be an astronaut...

31:32.142 --> 31:37.022
I couldn't let people see
certain parts of myself.

31:38.065 --> 31:39.608
Been that way my whole life.

31:41.443 --> 31:43.487
What are you talking about?

31:47.616 --> 31:49.326
I'm in love with someone.

31:49.993 --> 31:51.411
But it's not Larry.

31:55.123 --> 31:57.084
Her name is Pam.

32:00.128 --> 32:01.296
Pam.

32:04.091 --> 32:05.217
The bartender?

32:06.802 --> 32:09.179
-No.
-Yeah.

32:24.611 --> 32:25.821
Are you saying...

32:30.075 --> 32:31.201
Jesus.

32:32.369 --> 32:33.954
You gotta be kidding me.

32:35.664 --> 32:36.957
I mean, that's...

32:44.882 --> 32:46.425
I guess I shouldn't have said anything.

32:48.844 --> 32:50.345
I'm sorry I brought it up.

32:51.722 --> 32:52.723
So am I.

35:03.228 --> 35:04.313
You do something?

35:06.190 --> 35:07.608
I am not Houdini.

35:23.790 --> 35:25.334
Will you stop singing, please?

35:28.837 --> 35:30.339
You prefer Elvis?

35:30.422 --> 35:31.965
I prefer silence.

35:34.426 --> 35:38.472
When I was young,
we were not allowed to listen to Elvis.

35:38.555 --> 35:41.183
Yeah. He was banned in the USSR.

35:41.808 --> 35:45.479
Danger of moral corruption
to Soviet youth.

35:46.021 --> 35:48.023
But for one ruble,

35:48.106 --> 35:51.151
bootleggers would copy
song onto X-ray film

35:51.235 --> 35:52.945
and play it on record player.

36:09.545 --> 36:11.213
He's fantastic.

36:16.260 --> 36:17.594
You like him?

36:18.929 --> 36:23.183
My wife, she wanted the first dance
at our wedding to be "Love Me Tender."

36:23.725 --> 36:24.852
I wanted Sinatra.

36:27.229 --> 36:28.480
What did you play?

36:29.481 --> 36:30.774
"Love Me Tender."

36:34.361 --> 36:35.487
Is she, your wife...

36:35.571 --> 36:38.657
She... formidable?

36:39.783 --> 36:41.618
That's definitely one way to put it.

36:45.205 --> 36:47.624
-We went to go see him last year.
-No.

36:48.876 --> 36:52.588
I don't know. It was... kinda sad.

36:52.671 --> 36:55.048
-Why?
-He was like a clown up there.

36:55.591 --> 37:00.220
The hair, costumes, big fat belly...
That's not Elvis.

37:02.014 --> 37:04.766
You Americans, you throw away so quickly.

37:04.850 --> 37:06.810
Everything needs to be new.

37:06.894 --> 37:10.272
New car, new dishwasher,
new Elvis Presley.

37:10.731 --> 37:13.734
Sorry, mister, Elvis will always be king.

37:14.568 --> 37:17.154
Yeah. But Ol' Blue Eyes
on the other hand...

37:18.906 --> 37:20.532
he just gets better with time.

37:25.037 --> 37:26.121
What?

37:27.289 --> 37:30.000
The light, it's a pattern. Look.

37:31.543 --> 37:32.836
Three short...

37:34.296 --> 37:35.547
three long.

37:36.840 --> 37:38.926
-Three short.
-SOS.

37:46.058 --> 37:47.142
Shit.

37:53.315 --> 37:54.733
Houston, this is Jamestown.

37:55.567 --> 37:58.237
Ed, thank God. You okay?

37:58.695 --> 38:01.448
I'm fine. I got your message.
Nice touch with the lights.

38:02.074 --> 38:03.742
Hell you been doing up there, buddy?

38:03.825 --> 38:06.620
Just needed a little alone time.

38:07.246 --> 38:09.373
Well, we sure are glad
you came up for air.

38:09.456 --> 38:11.333
We got some new problems here.

38:11.416 --> 38:14.419
...for translunar injection, or TLI,

38:14.503 --> 38:16.797
stating that
if the engine fired too early,

38:17.130 --> 38:20.133
it could significantly alter
Apollo 24's trajectory,

38:20.217 --> 38:24.012
and fuel needed to correct course is
very limited in the Apollo spacecraft.

38:24.429 --> 38:27.099
Furthermore, he addressed
NASA's cryptic press conference,

38:27.182 --> 38:30.936
saying he suspected this was due
to a prolonged communication failure

38:31.019 --> 38:35.232
likely caused by physical damage to
the command-service module's antennas.

38:35.315 --> 38:38.110
His hope is that whatever event
damaged the antennas

38:38.193 --> 38:41.363
did not also damage the fuel tanks
or guidance systems.

38:42.114 --> 38:46.034
Today, as families across America
celebrate the Christmas holiday,

38:46.118 --> 38:49.037
a NASA spokesman confirmed that
there has still been no contact

38:49.121 --> 38:50.789
-with Commander Ellen Wilson...
-Excuse me.

38:50.873 --> 38:52.082
-...and Deke Slayton.
-Sweetie.

38:52.165 --> 38:54.376
-No further information was given.
-Hey, Pam, can I get a beer?

38:54.835 --> 38:55.878
All right.

38:56.753 --> 39:00.007
Still, the prayers of the nation
are with these brave astronauts...

39:00.090 --> 39:01.341
Hello?

39:01.425 --> 39:02.759
She's alive.

39:04.511 --> 39:05.762
Thank God.

39:07.222 --> 39:11.852
They're not saying anything on the news,
and I was starting to think that...

39:14.897 --> 39:16.773
Anyway, thank you, Larry.

39:16.857 --> 39:18.650
We're trying to figure out a rescue.

39:18.734 --> 39:23.113
Nobody knows about this outside of NASA,
but I thought you should know.

39:23.197 --> 39:25.908
What, is she okay?
Where is she? Is she in...

39:25.991 --> 39:27.743
I can't talk about that right now.

39:27.826 --> 39:30.037
I'm already taking a big risk
even telling you this.

39:30.120 --> 39:31.538
I appreciate that,

39:31.622 --> 39:35.792
but I'm in the dark here,
Larry, with everybody else.

39:36.126 --> 39:37.503
I know, and I'm sorry.

39:37.586 --> 39:39.796
But that's how it has to be right now.

39:39.880 --> 39:42.508
With security so high
and this media blackout...

39:43.634 --> 39:45.427
we just have to be careful.

39:46.094 --> 39:47.471
You have every right to know, but...

39:47.554 --> 39:50.265
-But you don't wanna take the risk.
-That's not what I said.

39:50.349 --> 39:53.352
Listen, we're doing everything we can.
Okay?

39:53.435 --> 39:55.562
I promise I'll do my best
to keep you informed.

39:56.063 --> 39:57.272
I have to go right now.

40:00.817 --> 40:03.987
...America's space program
has become dangerously inept

40:04.071 --> 40:06.573
under President Kennedy's leadership.

40:06.657 --> 40:08.992
They say it's just a run of bad luck.

40:10.077 --> 40:12.579
Well, friends, that dog won't hunt.

40:13.038 --> 40:14.790
That was Governor Reagan of California

40:14.873 --> 40:17.251
continuing to criticize
the Kennedy administration

40:17.334 --> 40:20.212
in the run-up to the inaugural
Conservative Political Action Conference.

40:20.838 --> 40:24.258
The Kennedy administration and
representatives at NASA have not responded

40:24.341 --> 40:26.969
other than to call for unity
in this time of national emergency.

40:27.052 --> 40:28.053
Excuse me.

40:29.930 --> 40:31.265
Are you Pam?

40:31.849 --> 40:32.850
One and only.

40:36.186 --> 40:38.063
I'm sorry, I just...

40:38.856 --> 40:41.191
I've heard a lot about you.
My husband comes here a lot.

40:41.567 --> 40:43.485
Well, a lot of husbands come here a lot.

40:44.695 --> 40:45.904
What can I get you?

40:49.074 --> 40:50.617
Surprise me.

41:00.377 --> 41:03.463
The way he talks about this place,

41:03.547 --> 41:07.134
like it's... hallowed ground or something.

41:08.010 --> 41:09.178
I mean, it's...

41:10.012 --> 41:11.013
It's a shithole.

41:12.681 --> 41:14.141
Yes. It is.

41:21.481 --> 41:25.611
I would never have dared
step foot in here before.

41:28.697 --> 41:31.825
No. It was always, you know, understood,

41:31.909 --> 41:35.621
one of the unspoken rules,
that wives don't go to the Outpost.

41:37.164 --> 41:39.041
Sure have a lot of rules, don't they?

41:43.128 --> 41:44.755
Yes, they do.

41:47.257 --> 41:50.344
And you know what? They're all...
Excuse my language, they're...

41:52.554 --> 41:53.722
Actually, no.

41:54.723 --> 41:57.809
Don't... excuse my language.
They're bullshit.

41:59.353 --> 42:00.521
All of them.

42:01.188 --> 42:06.777
They way we're supposed to dress
and speak and think, it...

42:11.073 --> 42:12.282
I mean...

42:13.450 --> 42:16.370
Forgive me,
but from the outside looking in,

42:16.453 --> 42:17.955
you have it pretty good.

42:19.081 --> 42:20.749
You're married to an astronaut.

42:21.333 --> 42:23.168
The whole country worships you.

42:24.127 --> 42:27.548
Sitting there
in your big, beautiful living rooms.

42:28.131 --> 42:32.845
Listening to your husbands in space
on your squawk boxes.

42:33.762 --> 42:36.473
So, if you're looking for someone
to feel sorry for you, just...

42:37.432 --> 42:38.684
don't look here.

42:39.309 --> 42:42.396
There are a lot of people out there
who don't have...

42:48.110 --> 42:49.319
I'm sorry.

42:49.778 --> 42:51.822
With everything going on
the past couple days, I...

42:52.906 --> 42:56.994
It's okay. Did you know any
of the astronauts in the accident?

42:59.746 --> 43:00.747
I knew them all.

43:02.082 --> 43:04.835
Some better than others.

43:06.837 --> 43:08.755
You know Ellen? Wilson?

43:08.839 --> 43:09.882
Yeah.

43:10.299 --> 43:14.052
We've become good friends
over the past couple of years.

43:14.761 --> 43:16.180
Since she was in training.

43:17.806 --> 43:21.226
And then something happens and...

43:21.727 --> 43:23.562
you're just another person
watching it on the news.

43:28.942 --> 43:31.195
What about you? You know anyone up there?

43:35.782 --> 43:37.993
Yes. My husband. He's at Jamestown.

43:40.412 --> 43:43.290
-You're Karen Baldwin?
-I am.

43:43.373 --> 43:45.709
-My God, I'm so sorry--
-No, don't. Don't.

43:48.295 --> 43:49.922
I didn't come here looking for pity.

43:57.137 --> 43:58.138
Hey.

44:00.098 --> 44:01.266
You should come with me.

44:02.476 --> 44:03.602
Come with you where?

44:03.685 --> 44:05.062
To JSC.

44:05.145 --> 44:07.523
They have a private viewing room
for families

44:07.606 --> 44:09.942
where we can watch the missions
during a media blackout.

44:10.025 --> 44:12.611
I don't think that's a very good idea.

44:12.694 --> 44:14.947
Well, it's better than watching it
on the news, right?

44:15.030 --> 44:16.573
Well, is it even allowed?

44:17.908 --> 44:19.660
You mean, is it against the rules?

44:23.580 --> 44:25.624
We've got a 33-minute window

44:25.707 --> 44:30.212
during which Apollo 24
will be within lunar orbit range.

44:31.880 --> 44:35.425
Ed, you'll launch the LSAM up
from the lunar surface

44:35.509 --> 44:38.804
at exactly eight hours,
50 minutes from now.

44:38.887 --> 44:44.685
That will put you right alongside them
at the exact moment they enter the window.

44:45.018 --> 44:46.562
You'll dock the two craft

44:46.645 --> 44:52.776
and use the LSAM's engine
to slow 24 into lunar orbit.

44:52.860 --> 44:53.944
Copy that.

44:54.862 --> 44:57.364
If this doesn't happen within the window,

44:58.156 --> 45:02.369
Ellen and Deke will just keep drifting off
into deep space.

45:02.828 --> 45:05.581
And if Ed is still alongside them
at that point,

45:05.664 --> 45:08.375
he won't have enough fuel
to get back either.

45:08.667 --> 45:11.170
Flight, we might have another problem.

45:15.215 --> 45:16.466
What is it, Gordo?

45:16.884 --> 45:19.052
The distance you're asking Ed to fly.

45:19.553 --> 45:21.889
You're really pushing
the range of the LSAM.

45:23.765 --> 45:26.768
Gordo's right. He'd barely have
enough fuel to get up and back,

45:26.852 --> 45:28.937
let alone pulling twice his weight
with 24.

45:30.105 --> 45:31.732
What about Apollo 15?

45:32.357 --> 45:34.985
The descent stage has fuel left in it
after we touched down.

45:35.819 --> 45:37.487
It's just been sitting there
for three years.

45:37.571 --> 45:39.656
Just take the rover out there
and go get it.

45:40.157 --> 45:41.325
That could work, Flight.

45:41.408 --> 45:43.911
But the LEM wasn't designed
to be a fuel pump.

45:44.578 --> 45:48.665
We'll need to work up a procedure on how
to get access to the fill-drain valves.

45:50.209 --> 45:51.376
Tim--

45:52.294 --> 45:55.255
Take LMSYS and Control to the SSR,
work up a procedure.

45:55.339 --> 45:58.091
Make sure to loop in
Grumman and North American.

45:59.134 --> 46:01.428
All right. Let's go.

46:01.512 --> 46:03.972
We don't have a lot of time, people.

46:04.056 --> 46:05.265
Minutes count.

46:05.974 --> 46:07.976
Ed, we'll get you those procedures soon.

46:09.269 --> 46:10.479
Roger that, Flight.

46:53.605 --> 46:55.482
All right, get a room already.

46:55.941 --> 46:57.109
Come on.

46:58.151 --> 47:01.029
All right. Okay. Okay.

47:02.239 --> 47:04.074
Flight,
I need to talk to you for a moment.

47:04.157 --> 47:05.450
Molly, I...

47:06.702 --> 47:10.205
I had to consider the safety
of two astronauts over one.

47:10.289 --> 47:12.749
-And if the same thing happened again--
-Margo.

47:12.833 --> 47:15.878
You made the right call.
I'd have done the same thing.

47:17.087 --> 47:18.755
That's not what I wanna talk about.

47:21.592 --> 47:24.386
I got a pretty good look at 24
when the J-2 fired.

47:24.469 --> 47:26.471
Think when our ship slammed into the side,

47:26.555 --> 47:28.599
it may have knocked
the S-band antenna loose.

47:28.682 --> 47:30.058
Could explain the comm issues.

47:30.142 --> 47:33.854
But I think their short-range radio
might still be working.

47:36.648 --> 47:39.276
Thanks, Molly.
We'll have INCO look at that.

47:40.068 --> 47:41.153
Okay.

47:43.447 --> 47:45.407
All right, everyone.
Let's get back to work.

47:53.957 --> 47:56.585
Okay. Oh, one second.

47:58.587 --> 47:59.880
You're not in uniform.

48:01.256 --> 48:02.591
What are you talking about?

48:03.258 --> 48:05.260
An astronaut that's been up there...

48:06.595 --> 48:07.804
wears gold,

48:08.430 --> 48:09.723
not silver.

48:10.390 --> 48:11.642
Your pin? You don't... No.

48:11.725 --> 48:14.061
Hey. You remember what you told me?

48:14.603 --> 48:18.357
One day they were gonna pin one of these
to your collar.

48:41.463 --> 48:44.299
Do you have any idea of the security risk?

48:44.842 --> 48:48.637
I mean, you open yourself up
to all kinds of--

48:48.720 --> 48:52.641
Who knows?
Blackmail, manipulation, for what?

48:53.058 --> 48:54.142
That's not fair.

48:54.226 --> 48:57.145
"Fair"? Don't you get it?

48:58.939 --> 49:02.317
You put all of us at risk.

49:02.776 --> 49:05.571
The whole goddamn program.

49:07.072 --> 49:08.991
I guess I thought you would've understood.

49:11.994 --> 49:14.246
You pushed for us when no one else did.

49:15.789 --> 49:18.292
Because you were good pilots.

49:20.878 --> 49:24.590
You being women... was beside the point.

49:25.174 --> 49:27.134
It's the whole point, Deke.

49:29.052 --> 49:30.304
The world's changing.

49:30.721 --> 49:31.930
And you helped change it.

49:32.014 --> 49:33.640
Well, I'll take the...

49:35.934 --> 49:36.977
I'll take the...

49:52.576 --> 49:53.744
Breathe.

50:03.170 --> 50:07.591
Focus, people. We've got just
over five hours until LSAM launch.

50:10.886 --> 50:11.970
Is it ready?

50:12.054 --> 50:13.138
Good to go.

50:23.732 --> 50:24.733
Okay.

50:25.150 --> 50:27.694
Raise Ed. Tell him
we're sending over the fuel procedure.

50:34.201 --> 50:37.746
You will need my help, Edward. You don't
have enough time. And you know this.

50:38.580 --> 50:40.123
I've got this under control.

50:40.207 --> 50:44.920
When a ship is in distress, international
law gives obligation to assist rescue.

50:47.464 --> 50:50.384
-I said I got it under control.
-Edward, you're not in Korea anymore.

50:50.467 --> 50:53.762
We are on the dark ocean together.

50:53.846 --> 50:55.973
We have no choice but to trust each other.

50:56.056 --> 50:57.182
Let me help you.

52:09.213 --> 52:10.547
-Hi.
-Hey!

52:15.969 --> 52:16.970
Where they at?

52:17.930 --> 52:19.348
He'll be launching soon.

52:20.057 --> 52:21.808
-Yeah.
-All right.

52:24.728 --> 52:25.771
Proud of you.

52:27.231 --> 52:28.232
Hey, Pam.

52:28.732 --> 52:29.775
Come and sit.

52:54.258 --> 52:55.801
Ten minutes to launch, Ed.

52:55.884 --> 52:58.720
Roger that.
Going off VOX while I button up here.

53:00.138 --> 53:01.765
Thank you, Mikhail.

53:06.562 --> 53:08.313
Oh, I almost forgot.

53:13.110 --> 53:17.197
Yeah, you may need that
for your drive back to Zvezda.

53:27.666 --> 53:28.709
Edward.

53:31.962 --> 53:33.172
Good luck.

53:47.269 --> 53:48.729
All right, Houston.

53:49.396 --> 53:50.689
LSAM hatch closed.

53:50.772 --> 53:52.274
Cabin pressurized.

53:52.357 --> 53:56.028
Master Arm on. Running P12 ascent.

54:00.073 --> 54:02.367
-How we looking, Control?
-Good to go, Flight.

54:02.451 --> 54:03.452
LMSYS?

54:03.535 --> 54:04.661
All good here.

54:05.329 --> 54:08.665
Okay. Initiate LSAM launch sequence.

54:09.374 --> 54:11.001
Five seconds, proceed.

54:11.919 --> 54:14.630
LSAM launch sequence initiated.

54:15.297 --> 54:21.011
Fire engine in three, two, one.

54:21.803 --> 54:22.888
Ignition.

54:42.741 --> 54:44.034
Commencing pitch-over.

54:59.550 --> 55:01.885
Ed, 24 will be coming at you soon.

55:02.302 --> 55:06.390
Once they're in range, you should be able
to raise them on your short-range VHF.

55:06.807 --> 55:07.808
Copy that.

55:29.663 --> 55:32.541
Apollo 24, this is Jamestown LSAM.

55:37.171 --> 55:39.506
24, this is Jamestown LSAM.

55:40.340 --> 55:42.050
24, Jamestown...

55:42.134 --> 55:43.218
Is that you, Ed?

55:43.302 --> 55:46.805
Roger that.
Funny running into you guys up here.

55:48.765 --> 55:52.227
We're here to rescue you.

55:53.520 --> 55:55.147
It's good to hear your voice, Ellen.

55:55.230 --> 55:56.398
How you doing, Deke?

56:01.403 --> 56:02.905
Hate to break it to you, Ed,

56:03.739 --> 56:07.409
but space has made him even more
soft and cuddly than usual.

56:08.160 --> 56:09.661
I'm sorry to hear that.

56:09.745 --> 56:12.206
All right, let's get you two
down to the deck.

56:12.289 --> 56:14.208
We don't have much time
before the window closes,

56:14.291 --> 56:17.294
so the plan is to dock you with the LSAM
and then slow both of--

56:17.377 --> 56:19.421
Ed, do you have a visual on us yet?

56:20.005 --> 56:21.256
Negative.

56:24.843 --> 56:26.595
What does he mean, "they're tumbling"?

56:27.638 --> 56:31.683
24 burned all the RCS prop
recovering from the overburn.

56:31.767 --> 56:33.185
Even the CM thrusters.

56:33.268 --> 56:36.104
They're bone-dry.
Can't correct the rotation.

56:37.439 --> 56:39.775
I matched their speed,
but I haven't been able to dock.

56:39.858 --> 56:41.360
They're wobbly.

56:41.985 --> 56:44.321
Too damn much
for the docking probe to latch on.

56:44.404 --> 56:45.447
Goddamn it.

56:45.531 --> 56:48.075
How much time do we have left
in the window, GUIDO?

56:48.742 --> 56:49.785
Twenty-four minutes, Flight.

56:56.041 --> 56:57.668
You really shouldn't be here.

56:57.751 --> 57:00.254
She invited me. Don't worry.
I didn't say anything that--

57:00.337 --> 57:02.923
What do you think
people are going to think?

57:03.006 --> 57:04.758
I don't care what they think.

57:05.342 --> 57:06.969
-You can't stay. It's no...
-No.

57:16.520 --> 57:17.521
Ellen?

57:20.440 --> 57:21.441
Ellen?

57:21.817 --> 57:22.901
You okay?

57:24.486 --> 57:25.821
About before...

57:28.115 --> 57:29.533
Deke, you don't have to.

57:29.616 --> 57:30.617
No, I do.

57:31.577 --> 57:32.703
It's important.

57:34.746 --> 57:36.039
Like I said...

57:39.918 --> 57:41.962
you got great things ahead.

57:45.591 --> 57:47.259
If we make it through this...

57:50.179 --> 57:52.764
don't tell anyone else what you told me.

57:53.390 --> 57:54.433
You hear me?

57:56.476 --> 57:57.728
What you told me...

57:59.021 --> 58:00.480
keep it to yourself.

58:04.067 --> 58:06.528
There's too many people in the world
like me.

58:09.114 --> 58:10.782
And it's all they'll see.

58:14.786 --> 58:15.996
24, come in.

58:26.507 --> 58:27.674
This is 24.

58:27.758 --> 58:30.636
So, Houston's still working on a fix
for the docking situation.

58:30.719 --> 58:32.137
They got the sims running nonstop,

58:32.221 --> 58:34.348
so they should be coming up
with a procedure shortly.

58:34.431 --> 58:35.432
So stand by.

58:35.516 --> 58:37.309
He's not gonna be able to dock.

58:38.018 --> 58:40.020
There's no way. Not in time.

58:51.990 --> 58:53.617
What if he doesn't need to dock?

58:54.826 --> 58:56.245
I may have an idea.

58:57.246 --> 58:58.747
I'm all ears.

58:58.830 --> 59:01.542
Gene Cernan once told me that in space,

59:01.625 --> 59:04.336
even a girl can toss a football
like Joe Namath.

59:04.419 --> 59:07.422
Joe Namath?
What the hell you talkin' about?

59:07.506 --> 59:09.967
Oh, I used to play
wideout with my brothers.

59:12.427 --> 59:13.428
You can't be serious.

59:14.179 --> 59:15.722
You got any better ideas?

59:17.933 --> 59:21.103
This is insane.
He's gonna throw it to her?

59:21.186 --> 59:23.814
It's risky, I know,
but we've got 20 minutes left, sir.

59:23.897 --> 59:26.817
If we don't do something,
we're gonna lose 24 and maybe Ed too.

59:26.900 --> 59:29.403
This cannot be our best option.

59:29.486 --> 59:32.865
-I'm not gonna stand here and let you--
-This is my call. I'm in command here.

59:32.948 --> 59:35.325
So you can either stay out of my way,
or you can fuck right off.

59:35.409 --> 59:36.410
Those are your options.

59:36.493 --> 59:37.744
CAPCOM, let's go.

59:39.037 --> 59:40.122
Yes, ma'am.

59:44.710 --> 59:47.880
Okay, Ed. We are go for EVA.

59:48.714 --> 59:49.965
Roger that, Houston.

59:50.465 --> 59:52.551
180-degree yaw maneuver completed.

59:52.634 --> 59:54.094
Moving to open hatch.

59:54.178 --> 59:58.015
Copy. You have 19 minutes
until you're outside the window.

1:00:21.705 --> 1:00:23.916
Proceeding to remove the tank from the QD.

1:01:24.560 --> 1:01:27.187
Okay. We got one shot at this.

1:01:28.730 --> 1:01:30.148
I'm gonna try to judge the throw

1:01:30.232 --> 1:01:33.986
so it hits you right in the numbers when
you crest the top of the ship's rotation.

1:01:34.069 --> 1:01:35.612
-Copy?
-Copy.

1:01:35.696 --> 1:01:37.573
Okay, this might not
weigh anything right now,

1:01:37.656 --> 1:01:39.032
but this sucker's got a lot of mass.

1:01:39.116 --> 1:01:41.076
So make sure
you latch that tether on tight.

1:01:41.159 --> 1:01:43.829
Okay, Ed, coming up on 15 minutes left
in the window.

1:01:43.912 --> 1:01:45.789
And Ellen's gonna need
at least ten minutes

1:01:45.873 --> 1:01:49.126
to hook up to the fill-drain valves
and refuel Osprey.

1:01:49.209 --> 1:01:52.045
So... now or never.

1:02:14.735 --> 1:02:15.819
It's too high!

1:02:16.236 --> 1:02:17.821
It went high. I missed.

1:02:22.618 --> 1:02:24.161
Ellen, don't!

1:02:50.145 --> 1:02:51.438
I got it.

1:02:52.439 --> 1:02:53.774
I got it!

1:02:56.485 --> 1:02:58.237
Houston... we have capture.

1:03:22.094 --> 1:03:23.512
Congratulations.

1:03:50.330 --> 1:03:51.540
You see that, Deke?

1:05:04.154 --> 1:05:05.322
Marge.

1:05:06.198 --> 1:05:10.160
I regret to inform you that...

1:05:10.244 --> 1:05:12.955
we lost Deke.

1:05:22.089 --> 1:05:23.173
Marge, come here.

1:05:32.224 --> 1:05:34.268
I know. I know, I know.

1:07:01.396 --> 1:07:03.565
Listen, you should probably get some rest.

1:07:06.401 --> 1:07:09.071
In the next few days,
when you've got settled,

1:07:09.488 --> 1:07:11.240
we'll start divvying up all the...

1:07:11.323 --> 1:07:12.658
"Next few days"?

1:07:14.409 --> 1:07:15.661
Ed, you're...

1:07:16.411 --> 1:07:18.539
you're going back home on Osprey.

1:07:20.541 --> 1:07:25.921
No, you can't expect to hold
to the mission now.

1:07:27.548 --> 1:07:29.258
You'd be alone.

1:07:30.342 --> 1:07:31.385
You were.

1:07:33.554 --> 1:07:35.013
Yeah, well, that's...

1:07:36.682 --> 1:07:38.892
I can't. No.

1:07:40.811 --> 1:07:42.563
I can't leave the base.

1:07:43.063 --> 1:07:44.273
Not after...

1:07:46.567 --> 1:07:47.943
everything that's...

1:07:51.738 --> 1:07:53.365
There'll be another relief mission
in a few weeks.

1:07:53.448 --> 1:07:54.950
We'll both go back with that one.

1:08:01.456 --> 1:08:03.542
With all due respect, sir...

1:08:04.585 --> 1:08:07.629
we came here to send you back home,
and that's what I'm going to do.

1:08:12.759 --> 1:08:14.469
I'm not gonna abandon the base.

1:08:14.928 --> 1:08:16.470
This is not a discussion.

1:08:25.147 --> 1:08:27.649
I relieve you as commander of Jamestown.

1:08:47.920 --> 1:08:48.962
I stand relieved.

1:09:36.176 --> 1:09:40.220
We now take you to a live press conference
with Commander Ellen Wilson,

1:09:40.305 --> 1:09:44.518
who has replaced Captain Edward Baldwin
as the lone American on the moon.

1:09:45.227 --> 1:09:48.397
Commander Wilson, would you like to say
anything about Deke Slayton?

1:09:48.479 --> 1:09:50.439
I'm sure you two were very close.

1:09:53.318 --> 1:09:55.487
He was one of the first of us.

1:09:56.822 --> 1:10:00.325
Started at all this before anybody,
American or Russian,

1:10:00.409 --> 1:10:02.661
had even gone up into space.

1:10:03.579 --> 1:10:05.080
He was from a different era.

1:10:05.873 --> 1:10:09.751
Definitely a stubborn man.

1:10:10.502 --> 1:10:13.005
When they told him
he couldn't fly because of his heart,

1:10:13.463 --> 1:10:15.299
he helped others get there.

1:10:15.966 --> 1:10:18.218
When they told him he was too old to fly,

1:10:18.760 --> 1:10:22.514
he told them to go to hell,
and he put on a space suit...

1:10:24.099 --> 1:10:26.018
and he made it all the way to the moon.

1:10:26.101 --> 1:10:29.438
Commander, with the loss of
Deke Slayton and Harrison Liu,

1:10:29.521 --> 1:10:32.316
space travel is seeming like
a very dangerous endeavor.

1:10:32.983 --> 1:10:35.944
With what you've been through,
do you feel that it's still worth it?

1:10:37.196 --> 1:10:38.322
Worth it?

1:10:42.409 --> 1:10:44.077
I mean, it's dangerous.

1:10:45.913 --> 1:10:52.127
Lives have been lost, and, honestly,
probably more will be lost.

1:10:53.420 --> 1:10:56.048
But every one of us knew the risks
before we joined,

1:10:57.090 --> 1:10:58.800
the toll it takes on us

1:10:58.884 --> 1:11:01.428
-and on the ones we love.
-Straight to bed. Thank you.

1:11:01.512 --> 1:11:03.764
But we all signed up just the same.

1:11:05.057 --> 1:11:07.434
It's the price we pay to push forward...

1:11:09.061 --> 1:11:11.188
to explore the universe...

1:11:11.271 --> 1:11:12.898
and wander into the unknown.

1:11:13.607 --> 1:11:16.693
Pushing ourselves to the limits
of what's possible.

1:11:19.530 --> 1:11:21.740
Are there sacrifices that have to be made?

1:11:22.824 --> 1:11:23.867
Of course.

1:11:24.993 --> 1:11:27.496
But sacrifice is a part of any journey.

1:11:29.706 --> 1:11:31.750
It's like those caravans,

1:11:31.834 --> 1:11:34.628
the wagon trains that crossed our country
a hundred years ago

1:11:34.711 --> 1:11:36.046
in search of a new home.

1:11:37.214 --> 1:11:41.093
Or the ships that sailed across
the Atlantic in search of a new world.

1:11:42.970 --> 1:11:46.890
Taking on these great challenges
against great odds...

1:11:49.810 --> 1:11:51.603
that's what makes us human.

1:12:01.530 --> 1:12:04.575
Remember, we chose to go to the moon

1:12:04.658 --> 1:12:06.368
not because it was easy...

1:12:08.954 --> 1:12:10.372
but because it was hard.

1:12:11.832 --> 1:12:12.958
So, yes.

1:12:14.710 --> 1:12:16.795
Yes, I think it's worth it.

1:12:17.212 --> 1:12:21.258
Because no matter how hard it is now,
when we look to the future,

1:12:21.884 --> 1:12:23.635
we can see that things can...

1:12:24.511 --> 1:12:26.180
they can get better.

1:12:27.097 --> 1:12:28.307
I do believe that.

1:12:28.891 --> 1:12:32.311
Mrs. Wilson, is there anything
you'd like to say to anyone back home?

1:12:36.523 --> 1:12:37.566
I...

1:12:38.317 --> 1:12:41.987
I just wanna say
I know I don't say it enough,

1:12:42.446 --> 1:12:46.575
but I miss you and I love you
with all of my heart, Larry.

1:12:47.951 --> 1:12:49.369
I'll be back home soon.

1:12:56.835 --> 1:12:59.963
Thank you, everyone. That was
the last question. Thank you for coming.

1:14:54.244 --> 1:14:55.746
Security's really high.

1:14:55.829 --> 1:14:59.082
Look at that. There's a whole
carrier task force out there.

1:14:59.625 --> 1:15:03.253
It just doesn't seem very safe.
What if it explodes in the atmosphere?

1:15:03.795 --> 1:15:06.632
That's why we're launching it
from the middle of nowhere, Karen.

1:15:06.715 --> 1:15:09.635
Look, it's risky, Ed.
This isn't just another payload.

1:15:10.052 --> 1:15:11.428
That thing's carrying plutonium.

1:15:11.512 --> 1:15:14.264
...expansion of the Jamestown colony.

1:15:14.765 --> 1:15:17.017
Ignition sequence... start.

1:15:17.559 --> 1:15:22.898
Five, four, three, two, one.

1:15:23.482 --> 1:15:24.483
Ignition.
