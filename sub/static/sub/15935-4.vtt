[Johnson] <i>Previously on</i> Masters of Sex...

00:15.586 --> 00:17.019
We have to hire new people.

00:17.054 --> 00:18.554
New partners.

00:18.589 --> 00:20.556
Pleasure to meet you. Nancy Leveau.

00:21.926 --> 00:23.692

00:23.727 --> 00:24.927
Good luck, baby.

00:26.530 --> 00:27.696
I don't understand.

00:27.731 --> 00:29.398
They're married.

00:29.433 --> 00:31.400
I don't know why

00:31.435 --> 00:33.869
you're sending
yourself flowers from Dan,

00:33.904 --> 00:36.171
and I'm not asking.

00:36.207 --> 00:40.042
I can't remember the
last time I satisfied her.

00:40.077 --> 00:42.444
- And you would prefer he...
- Take control.

00:42.479 --> 00:43.679
Say what he wants.

00:43.714 --> 00:45.948
Are you sure you want me to?

00:45.983 --> 00:48.617
Honestly, I can barely feel you.

00:48.652 --> 00:50.886
- [loud slapping]
- Ouch! Gary, stop!

00:50.921 --> 00:53.388
- That is enough!
- [screams]

00:53.424 --> 00:56.458
Uh, Virginia and Dan never married.

00:56.493 --> 00:58.360
You knew Virginia
would never give up her work,

00:58.395 --> 01:00.596
and I knew Dan
would always return to me.

01:00.631 --> 01:02.364
We predicted it, and we were right.

01:02.399 --> 01:04.967
My husband and I, we have an agreement,

01:05.001 --> 01:06.535
an arrangement,

01:06.570 --> 01:09.571
and that is nobody's
business but our own.

01:09.607 --> 01:14.509
I'm also in an open marriage,
so I judge no one, ever.

Nope.

- Yep.
- How do you know?

04:52.162 --> 04:53.795
Because I winked and licked my lips,

04:53.831 --> 04:56.264

I was doing you a favor.

05:16.920 --> 05:18.220

Besides, I have the children tonight.

Oh. That's probably why
Libby invited me to a movie.

05:26.063 --> 05:27.696
We're meeting at Art and Nancy's first.

05:27.731 --> 05:28.897
Lester, are you going?

05:28.932 --> 05:30.031
I wasn't invited.

05:30.067 --> 05:31.333
Well, I'm inviting you.

05:31.368 --> 05:33.401
Art made quite a point of insisting

05:33.437 --> 05:34.903
that I don't come alone.

05:34.938 --> 05:36.571
Why don't you bring your husband, then?

05:36.607 --> 05:39.074
I was going to, but he's stuck in Miami.

05:39.109 --> 05:40.809
A lot of swamps in Florida.

05:40.844 --> 05:43.745
Lester, just come. I'm
sure the more, the merrier.

05:43.780 --> 05:46.548
And bring Jane. I haven't
seen her in a while.

05:46.583 --> 05:48.049
Yeah, you and me both.

[Masters] What's all this?

06:02.032 --> 06:04.166
This? This isn't even half of it.

06:04.201 --> 06:05.867
He also got into Howie's box spring,

06:05.903 --> 06:07.502
and he shat... He shat, Bill...

06:07.538 --> 06:08.904
In Barbie's Dream House.

06:08.939 --> 06:11.039
Well, he is a
puppy. What did you expect?

06:11.074 --> 06:12.908
Well, for starters,
Bill, I didn't expect you

06:12.943 --> 06:15.510
to buy the kids a dog
without asking my permission first.

06:15.546 --> 06:18.380
Libby, Baxter is strictly the
children's responsibility.

06:18.415 --> 06:19.514
- [scoffs]
- No, I made that

06:19.550 --> 06:21.049
very clear to them

06:21.084 --> 06:23.062
before we even left the pet
store, and they promised.

06:23.086 --> 06:26.054
Which shows exactly how
much you know about children.

06:26.089 --> 06:27.889
They will say anything.

06:27.925 --> 06:29.457
I mean, Jenny promised me

06:29.493 --> 06:31.104
she would stop making
fun of Howie's bangs

06:31.128 --> 06:33.395
if I let her watch 15 more
minutes of television,

06:33.430 --> 06:34.763
and the second the show was over,

06:34.798 --> 06:36.464
she was calling him Moe Howard.

06:36.500 --> 06:38.733
- I don't know who that is.
- Because you are not

06:38.769 --> 06:40.113
in the trenches with these children

06:40.137 --> 06:42.771
day in and day out the way that I am.

06:42.806 --> 06:44.706
All right, I will, um... [clears throat]

06:44.741 --> 06:47.209
I'll talk to the kids tonight
when I pick them up.

06:47.244 --> 06:49.744
I will make it crystal
clear what is expected of them.

06:49.780 --> 06:51.279
- [scoffs]
- But really, you know,

06:51.315 --> 06:52.926
it's always tough at
the beginning with a pet.

06:52.950 --> 06:54.449
You just have to show him who's boss.

06:56.753 --> 06:59.287
[Johnson] And this past
week since your session?

06:59.323 --> 07:00.722
It's been awful.

07:00.757 --> 07:03.258
Gary and I have barely spoken.

07:03.293 --> 07:04.893
I don't know what to say to her.

07:04.928 --> 07:08.496
I've apologized, but I
think at the same time,

07:08.532 --> 07:10.999
she owes me an apology too, you know?

07:11.034 --> 07:14.469
Not the response she expected to elicit.

07:14.504 --> 07:17.639
I wanted him to act like a real man.

07:17.674 --> 07:19.307
Isn't that the way it's supposed to be?

07:19.343 --> 07:21.076
The husband's the strong one,

07:21.111 --> 07:23.745
and the wife's more demure?

07:23.780 --> 07:25.513
Well, I'm not sure

07:25.549 --> 07:28.917
that a woman who's truly demure

07:28.952 --> 07:32.520
would insist on being dominated.

07:32.556 --> 07:35.824
Is there any particular
reason, anything in your background

07:35.859 --> 07:39.461
that would make you think
this is how a couple should behave?

07:39.496 --> 07:41.663
You asked about my dad.

07:41.698 --> 07:44.432
He worked the line at
Birdseye for 40 years.

07:44.468 --> 07:46.968
I used to think all that
time watching peas and carrots

07:47.004 --> 07:48.603
roll past on a conveyer belt

07:48.639 --> 07:53.375
made him real good at
finding fault in an instant.

07:53.410 --> 07:55.210
Mom got the brunt of it.

07:55.245 --> 07:59.948
Gave her a black eye once
for dog-earing a paperback.

07:59.983 --> 08:01.783
Can you imagine?

08:01.818 --> 08:03.551
Unfortunately, I can.

08:03.587 --> 08:05.287
I've known men like that.

08:05.322 --> 08:07.455
It never occurred to me that
any woman would ever want

08:07.491 --> 08:09.124
to be treated that way.

08:09.159 --> 08:12.694
Fran, of all people, she
always seemed so easygoing.

08:12.729 --> 08:14.195
Even on our first date...

08:14.231 --> 08:15.897
He asked if he could order for me,

08:15.932 --> 08:19.334
and my heart skipped a beat.

08:19.369 --> 08:22.704
I thought, "Oh, yeah, he's
a take-charge kind of guy."

08:22.739 --> 08:24.239
And that appealed to you?

08:24.274 --> 08:25.640
Well, you wouldn't ask that

08:25.676 --> 08:27.876
if you'd seen my mother in a restaurant

08:27.911 --> 08:30.312
ordering for my dad.

08:30.347 --> 08:32.147
"Howard will have the lo mein."

08:32.182 --> 08:37.018
And him just opening and
closing his mouth like a guppy.

08:37.054 --> 08:39.688
She laid out his clothes in the morning.

08:39.722 --> 08:41.923
She wrote out what to say to his boss

08:41.957 --> 08:45.393
when he asked for a raise.

08:45.429 --> 08:48.396
He used to say he was
5'11" when they got married,

08:48.432 --> 08:51.399
but he'd be buried in a child's coffin.

08:51.435 --> 08:54.102
That's how much she'd
cut him down to size.

08:54.137 --> 08:56.504
[Gary] <i>I wanted a "honey,
I'm home" type of marriage.</i>

08:56.540 --> 08:59.207
A husband kisses his wife at the door,

08:59.242 --> 09:01.409
tells her how
delicious her pot roast is.

09:01.445 --> 09:03.378
And before they have sex,

09:03.413 --> 09:04.779
he asks if she's in the mood,

09:04.815 --> 09:06.581
and if she's not, that's fine.

09:06.616 --> 09:08.049
There's tomorrow.

09:08.085 --> 09:11.953
I wanted to show her love and respect.

09:11.988 --> 09:14.356
All the things your father never did.

09:14.391 --> 09:16.524
[Fran] <i>I wanted him to take charge.</i>

09:16.560 --> 09:19.427
I wanted him to put his pleasure first,

09:19.463 --> 09:22.964
to... to be the man
so I could feel like...

09:22.999 --> 09:25.567
Like you weren't your mother.

09:25.602 --> 09:29.938
Well, it certainly explains why
she wanted a man to take charge.

09:29.973 --> 09:32.974
And why he couldn't
possibly be that man.

09:33.009 --> 09:36.478
I mean, it's... It's
remarkable, actually.

09:36.513 --> 09:38.279
They couldn't be more
wrong for each other,

09:38.315 --> 09:41.383
each one wanting something the other is

09:41.418 --> 09:43.251
constitutionally incapable of giving.

09:43.286 --> 09:45.765
If only they'd been able to let
down their guard with each other

09:45.789 --> 09:47.422
when they first met.

09:47.457 --> 09:48.801
Well, I'm sure they didn't understand

09:48.825 --> 09:52.761
how their childhoods had affected them.

09:52.796 --> 09:55.296
That kind of insight
takes a long time to develop.

09:57.868 --> 09:59.467
And for you?

10:01.638 --> 10:03.204
What did it take?

10:04.775 --> 10:07.575
It took, uh...

10:07.611 --> 10:09.577
a while.

10:09.613 --> 10:12.280
What?

10:12.315 --> 10:15.583
I thought that you were going
to say that it took me

10:15.619 --> 10:18.586
to ask the right questions and
make you feel safe enough

10:18.622 --> 10:21.489
to reveal your secrets.

10:23.326 --> 10:24.793
I've told you mine.

10:24.828 --> 10:26.594
Not all of them, I'm sure.

10:26.630 --> 10:28.441
Well, certainly you
know why I'm the right person

10:28.465 --> 10:30.432
to treat a woman with a
steamroller of a mother,

10:30.467 --> 10:31.833
don't you?

10:34.304 --> 10:36.671
How do we treat
them? That's the question.

10:36.706 --> 10:40.375
Is there any point to
further sensate therapy?

10:40.410 --> 10:43.945
No. It's too traumatic for
him to engage with her physically,

10:43.980 --> 10:45.780
knowing what she
wants from him sexually.

10:45.816 --> 10:48.850
- Agreed.
- So then what?

10:48.885 --> 10:50.552
I mean, where do they go from here?

10:50.587 --> 10:54.456
Do they love each
other enough to make it work?

10:54.491 --> 10:56.569
No, the question isn't, do
they love each other enough?"

10:56.593 --> 10:59.527
It's, are they willing to truly engage

10:59.563 --> 11:02.464
in the work of intimacy?

11:02.499 --> 11:05.333
To stand naked in front of each
other outside the bedroom?

11:05.368 --> 11:08.002
Are they capable of reflection,

11:08.038 --> 11:11.239
of... of change?

11:11.274 --> 11:15.009
