WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:03.670
You're the boss.
More like wrangler.

00:04.672 --> 00:06.798
Jack asked if you
could come by
the club on Saturday.

00:06.882 --> 00:08.591
Matt! Hey.
See those guys over there?

00:08.676 --> 00:10.385
They are loaded and
they'd like to meet you.

00:10.469 --> 00:12.845
I'm just here to do a
little construction work.

00:13.055 --> 00:16.265
I'm the last guy to stand
in the way of Severide
and his buddy, Rice.

00:16.350 --> 00:18.184
But the things I hear
about this guy...

00:18.268 --> 00:20.895
We agreed that
what happened wasn't gonna
change anything between us.

00:20.979 --> 00:22.397
That we were still
just friends.

00:22.481 --> 00:24.732
Great night, though.
Yeah. It really was.

00:25.025 --> 00:27.777
These three years,
they've been the
best time of my life,

00:27.986 --> 00:31.197
but I wanna
be with my family.
I'm going to North Carolina.

00:35.119 --> 00:39.122
Yeah, so, Jessica Chilton,
that's me, obviously.

00:39.289 --> 00:40.748
Um...

00:40.833 --> 00:42.542
Anyways, everyone
calls me Chili,

00:42.626 --> 00:44.293
'cause I hate
the name Jessica.

00:44.378 --> 00:45.712
It's better than
my sister, I guess,

00:45.796 --> 00:48.005
'cause we call her
Jelly Bean.

00:48.132 --> 00:50.800
I've heard really great
things about you guys.

00:51.135 --> 00:54.345
The whole family vibe,
and all that, and...

00:54.972 --> 00:58.766
I've been a lot of places
where it's not really
like that, so...

00:59.059 --> 01:00.685
Yeah, here I am.

01:01.437 --> 01:03.187
Thank you, Chili.

01:03.647 --> 01:06.232
Chili is gonna be our
new paramedic in charge,

01:06.316 --> 01:07.984
in Ambulance 61.

01:08.527 --> 01:10.278
Everybody, please
make her feel welcome.

01:11.822 --> 01:13.072
Welcome.

01:16.118 --> 01:17.910
Chili, uh, Connie,
in the bullpen,

01:17.995 --> 01:20.037
she handles
all the paperwork.
Please check in with her.

01:20.164 --> 01:22.999
Okay, cool. Thanks for
taking me on, Chief.

01:23.208 --> 01:24.375
We are lucky to have you.

01:32.009 --> 01:33.301
Okay, everybody,
listen up.

01:34.970 --> 01:38.973
Here at 51, we are together
24 hours a day.

01:39.725 --> 01:42.018
And we are indeed a family.

01:42.269 --> 01:45.855
And we've been very fortunate
not to have much turn over.

01:46.190 --> 01:49.275
So, I'm gonna say this
with the utmost respect,

01:50.152 --> 01:51.569
get over it.

01:53.530 --> 01:55.031
Mills was here for
three years, Chief.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.575
You can't expect us
to just flip a switch
and get over it.

01:57.659 --> 02:02.497
And I have been here
for 22 years, Otis.

02:02.581 --> 02:06.918
Now, my orders are,
welcome in the new PIC.

02:08.212 --> 02:10.838
Now, any one of you,
you have a problem with that,
you come in my office.

02:10.923 --> 02:13.216
If you have
a legitimate reason,
we will discuss it.

02:13.300 --> 02:18.012
Other than that, you stop
looking like somebody just
pissed in your coffee!

02:19.556 --> 02:22.517
You're right, Chief.
It's taken care of.

02:23.227 --> 02:24.644
We got it, Chief.
Our bad.

02:30.651 --> 02:33.820
Truck 81, Squad 3,
Ambulance 61.

02:33.904 --> 02:36.072
Structure Fire.
Wabash and Silverhill.

02:36.865 --> 02:37.990
Super nice to meet you.

02:38.075 --> 02:39.992
Oh, yeah,
nice to meet you, too.

02:40.077 --> 02:42.036
So, you're the PIC?

02:42.162 --> 02:43.746
Yeah, but I'm totally chill.

02:43.831 --> 02:45.289
Some people are
really neurotic

02:45.374 --> 02:46.874
about how they
pack the jump bag,

02:47.000 --> 02:49.418
or whatever,
but not me.
Cool.

02:53.841 --> 02:57.176
Mmm. Sorry if that was
a little frosty back there.

02:57.261 --> 02:58.761
They're just honoring
their friend.

03:13.569 --> 03:15.361
Upper unit,
fully involved.

03:15.445 --> 03:16.487
Fire on one, also.

03:16.572 --> 03:19.198
Better put that sucker
out before the whole
damn block goes up.

03:19.283 --> 03:20.867
Sir, I'm gonna ask you
to step back, please.

03:20.951 --> 03:22.994
Don't let it get
the one next door.
That one's mine.

03:23.120 --> 03:24.453
He said stand back.

03:26.290 --> 03:29.375
Squad, search and rescue,
second floor.
Yeah, copy that.

03:29.459 --> 03:30.918
Squad three with me.

03:31.044 --> 03:33.546
We'll take the
downstairs, Chief.
Go to it.

03:33.630 --> 03:35.047
Dawson, Otis,
around the back.

03:35.132 --> 03:36.966
Herrmann, take the front
with me.

03:43.932 --> 03:45.975
Fire department, call out!

03:48.770 --> 03:51.188
Looks like an
overloaded power strip.

03:51.773 --> 03:54.150
Go check the
back of the house.
Copy that.

03:56.987 --> 04:00.323
Fire department, call out!
Fire department, call out!

04:14.212 --> 04:15.463
Otis, I need help!

04:19.927 --> 04:22.428
Hey, buddy,
can you walk?
Victoria!

04:22.512 --> 04:24.805
Excuse me?
Upstairs neighbor.

04:25.557 --> 04:27.516
Fire department! Call out!

04:29.770 --> 04:31.729
Let's check the bedroom.

04:36.360 --> 04:39.570
- Hey, hey! Wait, wait!
- Hey! I'm not getting air.

04:40.030 --> 04:42.657
My mask's malfunctioning.
We gotta go.
Go swap it out.

04:42.783 --> 04:44.909
I'm gonna check
this last room.
Copy that.

04:57.214 --> 04:59.382
Fire department!
Call out!

05:04.221 --> 05:06.889
Help me. Help.
I got you. I got you.

05:29.079 --> 05:30.079
Ah!

05:31.581 --> 05:34.166
Mayday, mayday.
I'm trapped on
the second floor.

05:34.251 --> 05:36.919
Casey, Herrmann!
Second floor, right now!

05:37.754 --> 05:38.754
On it.

05:42.259 --> 05:45.261
Severide! You okay?
Yeah, yeah. Get her first!

05:49.808 --> 05:51.183
Ready, go!

05:53.812 --> 05:57.565
Go! Go! Go!

05:59.609 --> 06:00.943
I got her.

06:02.195 --> 06:03.988
Come on.

06:09.995 --> 06:13.706
We got him, Chief.
Coming out now. Along with
a badly burned female.

06:13.790 --> 06:15.416
She needs
immediate transport.

06:16.460 --> 06:17.752
Copy that.

06:17.836 --> 06:19.670
Sixty-One to Main.
We need a second ambo.

06:19.963 --> 06:21.714
Go ahead.
I'll watch him.

06:21.798 --> 06:23.549
Name's Billy Carson.

06:26.678 --> 06:29.847
It was burning
when I got here.
I... I called 911.

06:30.807 --> 06:32.725
I went inside
to check on Victoria.

06:33.935 --> 06:35.394
Is she, um...

06:41.401 --> 06:43.235
Oh, man! Damn!

06:48.867 --> 06:50.993
Her airway's swelling
from the burns. We need
to intubate, now!

06:51.078 --> 06:53.245
She already has IO
access in the shoulder.

06:53.371 --> 06:55.331
She needs more fluids and
she's not burned there.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.041
Come on, sweetie.

07:19.689 --> 07:21.148
We're in.
Okay.

07:36.289 --> 07:41.418
Hey! All those computer
wires stuffed into the
one outlet, they yours?

07:41.753 --> 07:43.003
Yes, sir.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.381
You gotta be more careful.

07:48.718 --> 07:51.637
I use a power strip.
I cut it off.
I swear to God, I did.

07:51.721 --> 07:53.556
He doesn't know for sure
that's what started it.

07:55.851 --> 07:59.061
You gotta
keep the faith, Billy.
Truth comes out.

08:00.063 --> 08:01.856
You believe me,
don't you?

08:03.733 --> 08:05.192
Yeah, I do.

08:12.909 --> 08:14.660
Third degree burns and
severe smoke inhalation.

08:14.744 --> 08:15.911
Get her prepped for
the burn unit.

08:22.169 --> 08:24.503
On three.
One, two, three.

08:26.756 --> 08:28.382
Give me another ten...

08:34.264 --> 08:35.890
Oh, heck of
a first day, huh?

08:35.974 --> 08:37.099
Yeah.

08:37.434 --> 08:40.769
Hey! Great call on the
second IV to the jugular.

08:40.937 --> 08:43.272
Oh, yeah,
it's a go-to move on
the West Side.

08:43.648 --> 08:44.648
Lots of trauma
over there?

08:44.733 --> 08:48.152
Yeah, it's nonstop.
It's just burning,
shooting, looting.

08:49.029 --> 08:51.447
Wild, wild West.

08:51.531 --> 08:54.575
Yeah. So, lunch at
Sticky Rice, on me?

08:54.659 --> 08:56.744
Oh, I'd love to,
but, Thai food...

08:56.828 --> 09:00.247
I'm having kind of an
acid reflux thing lately.
Sorry.

09:01.291 --> 09:04.376
Oh, yeah, no problem.
Some other time then.

09:04.461 --> 09:06.212
We can figure something
else out though.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.047
Yeah, sure.

09:14.221 --> 09:16.013
Hey!

09:20.101 --> 09:21.143
What's up?

09:26.358 --> 09:28.984
Did you notice anything
about Rice
in that last fire?

09:29.486 --> 09:30.819
What about him?

09:30.946 --> 09:32.655
Where he was when
Severide got trapped.

09:33.740 --> 09:36.158
He was, uh, swapping out
his SCBA. So?

09:38.578 --> 09:39.578
What?

09:39.663 --> 09:42.289
He was running out
when everyone else
was running in.

09:42.374 --> 09:43.749
Hey!

09:43.833 --> 09:46.418
A couple of weeks ago you
accuse the guy of throwing
somebody out of a window.

09:46.503 --> 09:48.545
Now you're calling him
a ducker?

09:48.630 --> 09:50.381
The pool hall fire
at O'Bannon.

09:50.465 --> 09:53.050
He was out
"looking for his Denver Bar"?

09:53.134 --> 09:55.010
Come on,
the guy's practically
welded to the thing.

09:55.095 --> 09:57.429
When did you become
Little Miss Gossip,
anyway, Otis?

09:57.847 --> 09:59.098
Okay, fine!

09:59.182 --> 10:00.891
Saturday. Which one of
you two's helping me

10:00.976 --> 10:02.559
install the mirrored
glass at Stilettos?

10:02.644 --> 10:04.853
Ooh.
Uh, day date.

10:06.564 --> 10:08.148
I'm taking Baba
to brunch. What?

10:08.692 --> 10:10.484
Cruz?
Yeah, I can't, Lieutenant.

10:12.070 --> 10:13.487
You guys get
born again or what?

10:15.657 --> 10:16.865
I'll help.

10:17.534 --> 10:18.951
So how does
this work, Lieutenant?

10:19.035 --> 10:20.953
You get paid in singles,
or you get checks?

10:22.205 --> 10:23.622
Very funny.

10:23.707 --> 10:26.709
I bet you need a hand
getting those poles up, huh?

10:33.717 --> 10:37.720
Yeah, well, Nesbitt's building
a whole chain of 'em.

10:38.138 --> 10:40.973
And guess who's gonna be
buying their lake house
from doing all the work?

10:41.057 --> 10:44.059
Oh, careful who you get
in bed with, Lieutenant.

10:44.144 --> 10:45.227
What's that mean?

10:46.104 --> 10:49.815
Seven years
in the fire department.
Guy suddenly quits.

10:49.899 --> 10:50.899
Just saying.

10:51.735 --> 10:54.486
If I only wanted to
work with saints, I'd be
out of business pretty quick.

10:55.280 --> 10:57.156
Your call.
Is it?

10:57.866 --> 11:01.785
Well, thank you for
letting me make my
own decisions, Otis.

11:01.911 --> 11:03.287
'Cause I was gonna run
everything by you.

11:09.419 --> 11:10.919
Hey, Antonio!

11:11.880 --> 11:13.380
Hey, sis!
You got a minute?

11:14.424 --> 11:15.758
Yeah, everything okay?

11:16.551 --> 11:19.053
You pulled a guy out
of a fire this morning,
Billy Carson.

11:19.137 --> 11:20.471
Yeah. What about him?

11:22.265 --> 11:23.307
Talk to him at all?

11:24.225 --> 11:26.185
Uh, uh...
Yeah, a little.

11:26.269 --> 11:28.771
He said he was out to
buy a new video game.

11:28.855 --> 11:31.023
And when he got back,
the place was on fire.

11:31.107 --> 11:33.525
I found him on the stairs,
passed out from the smoke.

11:33.610 --> 11:35.110
His story, you buy it?

11:35.320 --> 11:37.071
Yeah. Why?

11:39.324 --> 11:42.576
When they admitted
the upstairs neighbor into
the burn unit at Chicago Med,

11:42.660 --> 11:43.911
they found...

11:47.749 --> 11:50.751
Before she got burned up,
somebody raped her
and left her for dead.

11:57.384 --> 11:58.717
Oh, my God!

12:08.103 --> 12:09.186
Hey. Otis, right?

12:09.938 --> 12:11.146
Yeah.

12:11.481 --> 12:12.689
How long you
been on elevators?

12:14.692 --> 12:15.943
Seven years.

12:17.487 --> 12:19.071
Lucky number seven, right?

12:20.824 --> 12:22.449
That's right.

12:23.701 --> 12:25.202
Welcome to 51.

12:26.996 --> 12:28.455
Yeah, thanks.

12:32.001 --> 12:33.127
Guys, check this out.

12:33.211 --> 12:34.670
Hey, what do
we got here?

12:34.754 --> 12:36.046
Mystery.

12:36.714 --> 12:39.091
Oh, where from?
Doesn't say.

12:39.175 --> 12:41.385
Well, who's it addressed to?
Just says "51 ".

12:41.469 --> 12:42.553
Well, you're gonna
open it?

12:42.637 --> 12:43.971
Well, as union rep,

12:44.055 --> 12:45.764
it seems I should
do the honors.

12:45.849 --> 12:47.015
Sure.

12:57.861 --> 12:59.194
Good Lord!

13:03.366 --> 13:04.908
Blueberry crumble.

13:05.702 --> 13:06.827
Oh!

13:08.371 --> 13:10.205
Whoa!
Sweet potato.

13:10.290 --> 13:11.540
Oh!

13:12.667 --> 13:15.043
- Mmm!
- Oh, my God!

13:16.796 --> 13:18.547
Apple crisp.
Yeah!

13:22.135 --> 13:23.218
Oh!

13:34.230 --> 13:35.522
What's it say?

13:35.607 --> 13:36.732
Uh, it...

13:41.404 --> 13:44.573
"To my 51 family,
we'll go toe to toe with
Dinkel's any day of the week.

13:45.033 --> 13:47.326
"Don't let Mouch bogart
the blueberry crumble."

13:48.495 --> 13:49.912
"Love, Mills."

13:54.751 --> 13:56.877
Still can't believe
he did it.

14:02.217 --> 14:03.967
Is that your partner?
Yeah.

14:04.260 --> 14:06.345
Actually, he worked
Squad, too.

14:06.596 --> 14:09.389
And truck.
And he's an unbelievable cook.

14:09.474 --> 14:10.766
Mind blowing.

14:17.273 --> 14:19.942
Hey, Dawson,
there's a guy out here,

14:20.026 --> 14:21.818
says that you pulled him
out of the Wabash fire.

14:23.154 --> 14:24.488
Billy Carson?

14:24.822 --> 14:25.948
I guess.

14:30.620 --> 14:32.120
Hey, what's
going on, Billy?

14:32.705 --> 14:35.541
Victoria, I went
to visit her
in Chicago Med.

14:35.625 --> 14:36.792
Yeah?

14:36.876 --> 14:39.127
When I got there, the cops
started questioning me.

14:39.212 --> 14:41.547
They... They're taking my
fingerprints, swabbing the
inside of my mouth,

14:41.631 --> 14:43.549
like it's my fault
or something.

14:43.633 --> 14:45.384
Well, was it?
No, man.

14:45.468 --> 14:47.386
No! I always
turn the power strip off
when I'm not using it.

14:47.470 --> 14:48.971
I swear to God.

14:51.015 --> 14:53.642
You... You still
believe me, right?
You said you did.

14:54.519 --> 14:55.769
Yeah, I do.

14:56.145 --> 14:58.146
Okay, thank God.
'Cause I was

14:58.523 --> 15:01.525
hoping you could put in
a word for me, you know,
if anybody asks.

15:05.280 --> 15:07.155
Yeah, sure. Why don't you
give me your number?

15:11.744 --> 15:13.287
Truth comes out, right?

15:13.913 --> 15:15.038
Yeah, it does.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.001
Okay. Um, thank you.

15:19.836 --> 15:22.004
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

15:49.157 --> 15:50.907
Rice, you got a minute?

15:51.659 --> 15:52.784
Yeah, sure.

15:59.667 --> 16:01.293
You worked at 114, right?

16:01.377 --> 16:02.794
Yeah, for a minute.

16:02.879 --> 16:04.880
Name Jack Nesbitt
ever come up?

16:06.049 --> 16:07.257
I remember Jack.

16:08.551 --> 16:10.093
What does that mean?

16:10.928 --> 16:14.181
He's a pistol.
Why? What's up?

16:14.349 --> 16:16.600
I heard he got
jammed up before he quit.

16:16.726 --> 16:19.353
Missing checks or something.
Anything to that?

16:20.063 --> 16:23.065
A couple of guys got
popped, some dough
went missing.

16:23.149 --> 16:24.650
My understanding is
Nesbitt wasn't one of 'em.

16:24.734 --> 16:25.776
Huh.

16:25.860 --> 16:29.321
Things got a little hairy,
though. Internal Affairs
got involved.

16:29.572 --> 16:30.572
Yeah?

16:30.948 --> 16:33.825
What I heard, the accusation
pissed Nesbitt off,

16:33.910 --> 16:35.702
so he told them
to go to hell.

16:37.580 --> 16:39.998
Okay, I appreciate it.

16:40.291 --> 16:41.583
Yeah, no sweat.

17:02.522 --> 17:05.440
- Ambulance 61. Man down.
- Unknown causes.

17:05.566 --> 17:07.192
1705, Martin Luther
King Drive.

17:11.280 --> 17:12.447
Music choice?

17:12.532 --> 17:14.783
Oh, anything's fine,
except country.

17:18.454 --> 17:19.621
Why don't you pick it?

17:20.456 --> 17:21.748
Okay.

17:29.674 --> 17:34.428
Help! Ah! Help!
Help me, please!

17:35.304 --> 17:36.513
Help!

17:37.640 --> 17:39.766
Okay, no impalement.
So we should be able
to lift him straight up

17:39.851 --> 17:40.892
and his foot
should come loose.

17:40.977 --> 17:42.060
Help me, please!

17:42.145 --> 17:44.479
Sir, I need you
to be as calm
as you can, okay?

17:44.564 --> 17:47.441
Okay, call it.
One, two, three.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.867
I'm gonna set
your head down.

17:57.660 --> 17:59.161
Sir, I'm gonna need you
to stay with me.

17:59.245 --> 18:01.663
We're gonna get you
to the hospital
as soon as we can.

18:01.748 --> 18:02.873
Deep breaths.

18:07.879 --> 18:09.296
Can you tell me
what happened?

18:09.380 --> 18:12.257
I... I... That gate
was locked. I jumped...

18:12.341 --> 18:14.384
So you jumped the fence?
Yeah.

18:15.887 --> 18:18.305
I know, I know.
It hurts real bad.

18:19.307 --> 18:21.266
There we're done. Yes.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.604
- Does anything else hurt?
- No.

18:25.730 --> 18:27.898
Your head
or your neck?
My leg.

18:28.232 --> 18:30.442
Okay. All right,
just the leg.

18:31.986 --> 18:33.695
Be right back.
Where're you going?

18:36.032 --> 18:37.240
One sec.

18:38.785 --> 18:40.160
Where're you going?

18:44.791 --> 18:46.541
Ma'am, you having
trouble breathing?

18:52.507 --> 18:55.926
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!

18:58.638 --> 18:59.930
Oh, damn!

19:01.724 --> 19:04.726
Take a deep breath!
Chili! Get in here! Now!

19:05.478 --> 19:09.064
Wait! Wait! Oh...
Don't leave me.

19:13.194 --> 19:15.153
Damn!
She's been stabbed.

19:15.238 --> 19:17.197
We need to get her
into the ambo now!

19:20.576 --> 19:22.035
Ma'am, what happened?

19:27.124 --> 19:29.084
That guy robbed her
and stabbed her.

19:30.086 --> 19:33.255
Sixty-One to Main.
We need a second ambo
and police back up. Now!

19:33.339 --> 19:35.882
- Copy that, 61.
- Second ambo on the way.

19:37.468 --> 19:38.927
Here, hold onto me.

19:43.516 --> 19:45.892
Oh, bet he caught his
leg when he tried to
jump the fence.

19:45.977 --> 19:48.603
Yep.
Help. Help me!

19:49.272 --> 19:51.273
Hey! Hey, wait!

20:01.158 --> 20:02.242
What do we got?

20:02.326 --> 20:05.120
Our patient says that
this guy robbed
and stabbed her.

20:05.621 --> 20:06.746
Let's click him up.

20:26.017 --> 20:30.604
So, big thank you speech,
or your best donuts
in the city?

20:30.688 --> 20:31.813
Ooh!

20:33.274 --> 20:34.524
Good looking out
back there.

20:34.609 --> 20:37.569
Oh, Doughnut Vault? Yes!

20:38.154 --> 20:39.404
Did... Did they
have chocolate?

20:39.488 --> 20:41.281
Mmm...
No, they were all out,

20:41.365 --> 20:42.699
but they have
chestnut glazed.

20:43.075 --> 20:45.994
Oh, no. Um, those are
the only ones that I'm...

20:46.162 --> 20:47.495
Thank you, though,
I'm good.

20:47.663 --> 20:48.830
It's okay.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.126
So, where'd you learn
how to speak Spanish?

20:53.210 --> 20:55.420
Oh, I don't...
I don't speak it actually.

20:55.504 --> 20:59.758
Uh, Dawson and I
watch telenovelas.

21:00.676 --> 21:01.760
Shut up.

21:01.844 --> 21:03.929
Seriously.
Guilty pleasure.

21:04.013 --> 21:06.723
Wow, y'all weren't
kidding about
the whole family vibe.

21:06.849 --> 21:09.225
Once you're on
the inside, anyways.

21:09.518 --> 21:11.895
Well, what about you?
Do you have family
in town?

21:11.979 --> 21:14.856
My sister, Jelly Bean
used to live here, but she
just took off to Kansas City

21:14.941 --> 21:16.399
to live with
our older sister.

21:17.360 --> 21:18.526
What's her name, Lollipop?

21:19.278 --> 21:22.781
No, it's Margaret.
Go figure.

21:23.366 --> 21:24.991
So, it's just me
in Chicago.

21:25.409 --> 21:26.868
Well, 51's great.

21:26.953 --> 21:28.536
I mean, they'll...
They'll come around.

21:29.372 --> 21:30.997
I'll be here when they do.

21:32.166 --> 21:33.708
Hey, can I borrow
your eyes?

21:34.460 --> 21:35.543
Sure. For what?

21:35.628 --> 21:37.587
Antonio asked me to take
a look at the Wabash fire.

21:37.672 --> 21:39.381
See if there were
any signs of arson.

21:40.174 --> 21:41.549
You tell him that
OFI's looking into it?

21:42.343 --> 21:45.762
He just wants a gut check.
And I told him
I'd ask you to come with.

21:47.723 --> 21:48.765
All right.

21:52.645 --> 21:53.687
Hi.

21:54.897 --> 21:56.147
Hey.

21:56.232 --> 21:57.482
You hungry?

21:57.775 --> 21:58.900
Uh...

21:59.777 --> 22:00.819
I insist.

22:04.198 --> 22:05.949
So, what's the
dirty little secret?

22:06.575 --> 22:07.784
Come again?

22:08.744 --> 22:13.957
Handsome fireman.
Successful construction
business. Not married.

22:14.417 --> 22:16.584
There's gotta be
something wrong with you.

22:18.087 --> 22:20.922
The job plays hell
on a relationship.

22:22.341 --> 22:23.842
You, too, huh?

22:25.553 --> 22:28.555
So did she break your heart,
or you broke hers?

22:30.141 --> 22:31.141
Hmm?

22:31.767 --> 22:33.268
Just didn't work out.

22:35.146 --> 22:36.604
Mine either.

22:38.315 --> 22:39.774
So, do you wanna do it?

22:40.651 --> 22:41.901
Sorry?

22:41.986 --> 22:43.528
The construction gig.

22:43.612 --> 22:45.196
You're so skittish.

22:45.322 --> 22:46.948
Why are you so
nervous around me?
I'm not.

22:47.033 --> 22:48.783
You are.
I'm not.

22:51.746 --> 22:52.787
Hmm.

22:53.205 --> 22:56.416
So, the people investing,
you know 'em?

22:57.251 --> 23:00.462
No, but I know Jack.
He's a good guy.

23:01.047 --> 23:02.756
What's your
relationship with him?

23:02.840 --> 23:04.591
If you don't mind
me asking.

23:05.134 --> 23:06.843
You, uh,
boyfriend-girlfriend?

23:07.094 --> 23:09.471
No. It's nothing like that.

23:10.639 --> 23:13.224
It's...
It's purely contractual.

23:13.684 --> 23:15.393
Meaning you work for him?

23:15.603 --> 23:16.978
Essentially.

23:17.813 --> 23:18.897
Right.

23:18.981 --> 23:20.607
Let's just leave it
at that.

23:24.987 --> 23:27.489
Anyway, I think you should
really think about it.

23:28.115 --> 23:31.659
Jack loves having
you around. So do I.

23:33.329 --> 23:34.662
Yeah, yeah.

23:36.582 --> 23:38.041
Thank you.

23:40.795 --> 23:42.754
Uh, Herrmann thought
it started here.

23:46.759 --> 23:48.510
Billy swears
he turned it off.

23:54.975 --> 23:57.018
There's no way
to know.

24:16.831 --> 24:17.914
What?

24:22.878 --> 24:23.962
Burnt rubber?

24:24.046 --> 24:26.214
Yeah, that's what
it smells like.

24:35.057 --> 24:37.183
It's like it was dripping
from the ceiling.

24:42.606 --> 24:44.524
Let's go check out
the second floor.

24:53.993 --> 24:57.912
So, what? It dripped
through the hole and spread
the fire down below?

24:59.498 --> 25:01.082
That's what
it looks like.

25:03.252 --> 25:06.546
Shredded tires...
That can be used as
an accelerant, right?

25:06.839 --> 25:10.592
Mmm-hmm. If you're looking
to kill somebody, toxic smoke
will do the job fast.

25:19.435 --> 25:20.727
Wasn't no accident,
was it?

25:22.521 --> 25:24.772
No, somebody
torched the place.

25:25.858 --> 25:27.692
Was it that doctor dude?

25:29.945 --> 25:31.112
Excuse me?

25:31.947 --> 25:34.157
Go ahead and tell him
what you told us.

25:34.241 --> 25:36.034
Seen this dude walk around
back to the parking lot.

25:36.493 --> 25:39.329
Didn't really get
a look at him or nothing,
but he was wearing them...

25:39.413 --> 25:40.914
You know,
what doctors wear?

25:42.458 --> 25:43.833
Scrubs?
That's right.

25:51.383 --> 25:55.386
Hey, so, I heard you
caught a rape case where
the victim got burned up?

25:55.804 --> 25:59.057
That's right.
Nurse from Chicago Med.
Raped, beaten,

25:59.642 --> 26:01.768
and perp torched
the joint on his way out.

26:02.394 --> 26:03.603
Where'd you hear?

26:03.687 --> 26:06.981
Uh, an alert,
uh, from the National
Sex Offender Registry.

26:07.191 --> 26:11.402
NCIC created
a geofence for rapes
with an arson component

26:11.612 --> 26:13.488
on the East Coast
and the Midwest.

26:14.490 --> 26:15.657
What do you know
about this guy?

26:16.158 --> 26:18.701
Very little.
Witness, who can't ID him,

26:19.453 --> 26:23.665
said he saw somebody behind
the victim's house two hours
before the bonfire.

26:27.628 --> 26:31.631
Let me ask you this.
Was he dressed as a doctor?

26:32.007 --> 26:34.384
Yeah, that's right.
And he had his arm
in a sling.

26:36.095 --> 26:37.720
Son of a bitch, Hank.

26:38.013 --> 26:39.180
What is it?

26:40.099 --> 26:44.519
There's just too many
similarities to a case that
I worked ten years back.

26:45.020 --> 26:46.145
Uh, the victim,
she still alive?

26:47.022 --> 26:48.481
Barely.

26:52.778 --> 26:54.612
I'm on the next
plane to Chicago.

27:02.413 --> 27:04.497
Hey, you ever get that
mask checked out?

27:07.418 --> 27:08.960
Your SCBA?

27:09.044 --> 27:12.547
Oh! Yeah. No, I'm,
uh, using a spare.

27:13.382 --> 27:16.467
Mine's going to the repair
shop. Was gonna get the
regulator checked out.

27:16.719 --> 27:18.386
Hmm. Cool, cool.

27:19.179 --> 27:20.930
Gotta keep an eye
on those things.

27:21.223 --> 27:22.348
Yeah.

27:30.107 --> 27:32.942
At first, I thought Otis
was just talking smack.

27:33.027 --> 27:36.779
But watching Rice
sit there after that call,

27:36.864 --> 27:40.325
reading the paper
instead of trouble shooting
his SCBA,

27:41.160 --> 27:42.410
it bugged me.

27:42.578 --> 27:44.746
So I did an
0800 checkout on it.

27:45.581 --> 27:48.750
I'm telling you,
there was nothing wrong
with his regulator.

27:51.211 --> 27:53.254
So, who's telling Severide?

27:54.506 --> 27:57.175
Better be damn certain
to go accusing
a guy at ducking.

27:57.259 --> 28:00.678
A rumor like that can
destroy a man's career.
Am I wrong, Mouch?

28:00.763 --> 28:02.055
You're not wrong.

28:03.474 --> 28:05.183
So, we're just not
gonna say anything?

28:05.726 --> 28:06.934
No.

28:07.936 --> 28:09.479
We're gonna
keep an eye out.

28:15.069 --> 28:16.569
Did he bear hug you?

28:16.779 --> 28:17.945
Who?

28:18.280 --> 28:19.781
Billy Carson.
Big Billy Carson.

28:19.865 --> 28:21.699
When you told him
that CPD cleared him.

28:21.784 --> 28:24.911
Oh, uh, no. He doesn't
know yet. I went by the
motel where he's staying,

28:24.995 --> 28:26.913
but he'd already
checked out.

28:26.997 --> 28:28.581
I'll try
calling him again.

28:32.669 --> 28:34.295
Jessica Chilton?

28:35.047 --> 28:36.714
Oh, yeah, that's me. Chili.

28:36.965 --> 28:38.132
Beg your pardon?

28:38.300 --> 28:40.134
She hates
the name Jessica.

28:40.761 --> 28:44.639
I hate it when people
mistake my firehouse
for a post office.

28:45.891 --> 28:48.976
Wow, your firehouse?
That's good...

28:51.230 --> 28:52.397
Never mind.

28:54.650 --> 28:56.734
I apologize. My bad.

29:04.868 --> 29:06.452
What you got there, Chili?

29:06.703 --> 29:08.830
I'm developing a new product
for the adult beverage market.

29:09.706 --> 29:13.584
Um, so in each box there's
gonna be miniature bottles
of champagne.

29:13.669 --> 29:17.422
And whenever you
press this button,
it activates a CO2 cartridge

29:17.506 --> 29:20.883
and it instantly chills it!
So, I call it, Chilleeze.

29:22.511 --> 29:24.178
Wait, it doesn't taste
like chili, right?

29:24.263 --> 29:28.850
No, it's champagne.
It's just chilled.
Chilled, Chilleeze.

29:33.021 --> 29:34.355
I love it!

29:38.193 --> 29:41.028
Let me see those bad boys.
Okay.

29:41.780 --> 29:43.072
You got a patent on this?

29:43.157 --> 29:44.449
Not yet,
but I'm working on it.

29:44.533 --> 29:47.535
Idea.
What if you call it...

29:48.203 --> 29:49.954
Bubleez?

29:51.165 --> 29:52.457
That's good.

29:52.541 --> 29:54.208
Maybe we could
sell it at Molly's.

29:54.877 --> 29:56.419
Yeah, now you're talking.
Really?

29:56.503 --> 29:59.714
Yeah, I'm telling you.
You got something here, kid.

30:17.900 --> 30:20.818
Ms. Dawson, hey,
it's Billy Carson.

30:20.903 --> 30:23.070
Uh, I just want you
to know everything's fine.

30:23.155 --> 30:25.323
That it doesn't matter
what anybody says about me.

30:25.407 --> 30:28.201
I know the truth.
Even if it doesn't
come out.

30:28.285 --> 30:29.827
Thanks, anyway.

30:30.537 --> 30:32.538
He doesn't know he's
no longer a suspect?

30:33.081 --> 30:34.832
I keep calling,
but he's not answering.
His...

30:34.917 --> 30:36.626
The voicemail's
not even set up.

30:37.461 --> 30:38.753
I got a bad feeling, Chief.

30:38.879 --> 30:40.087
How bad?

30:41.298 --> 30:43.216
This reminds me of
Darryl and Shay.

30:45.093 --> 30:46.761
And I don't wanna
go through that again.

30:48.180 --> 30:50.556
Okay. Why don't
you call Antonio?

30:50.641 --> 30:52.517
See if he can ping
Carson's phone.

30:52.601 --> 30:53.935
Will do.
Okay.

31:18.335 --> 31:22.547
Just... Just stay back!
Stay back or I'm gonna jump!

31:22.631 --> 31:24.507
By the time
we close the road,
get the jump bags out,

31:24.591 --> 31:26.676
it's gonna be too late,
if he's serious.

31:26.843 --> 31:28.261
Looks pretty serious
to me, Chief.

31:29.680 --> 31:32.682
We don't grab him fast,
this is gonna be over
before it starts.

31:32.766 --> 31:34.767
Kelly, go in from
the west side.

31:35.686 --> 31:36.936
I'll go in from
the east.

31:37.020 --> 31:38.396
Get to it.

31:48.156 --> 31:49.907
Billy, it's me.
Gabriela Dawson.

31:50.742 --> 31:52.368
Tell them to stay back!

31:52.452 --> 31:53.995
Billy, take it easy,
okay?

31:54.746 --> 31:56.330
Get away from me!
Billy, no!

31:57.499 --> 32:00.543
I'll... I'll jump.
I swear to God, I will.

32:02.004 --> 32:04.088
Chief, he trusts me.
If I can get over there,

32:04.172 --> 32:05.715
I think I can
talk him down.

32:07.342 --> 32:08.843
Okay, clip in.

32:14.975 --> 32:16.642
Be careful.
I will.

32:18.937 --> 32:20.313
Hey, Billy?
Yeah?

32:20.397 --> 32:22.023
I'm coming over,
okay? Just me.

32:23.358 --> 32:24.358
Okay.

32:48.050 --> 32:49.050
Cruz, I need more line.

32:49.134 --> 32:51.844
The rope's caught
on something at
your end of the rail.

32:58.268 --> 33:00.061
Dawson!
Casey!

33:04.274 --> 33:05.775
Don't... Don't come
any closer.

33:05.859 --> 33:07.860
You had nothing to do
with that fire, Billy.

33:07.944 --> 33:11.906
I know I turned it off.
But am I... Am I positive?
No, I can't say that.

33:12.074 --> 33:14.700
It wasn't an electrical fire.
That's why I was
trying to call you.

33:17.079 --> 33:18.788
It's gonna be okay.

33:20.874 --> 33:22.208
I promise.

33:28.799 --> 33:32.259
I can't! I can't!
I can't! I can't!
Billy. Billy. Billy!

33:37.432 --> 33:38.432
I can't, I can't...

33:38.517 --> 33:41.727
Billy, Billy, if you don't
grab that railing, you're
gonna take me down with you.

33:41.812 --> 33:43.354
Grab the railing so
we can step back over.

33:43.438 --> 33:45.189
It's my fault. I must have
forgot to turn it off.

33:45.273 --> 33:46.607
No, Billy!

33:47.234 --> 33:49.485
She's gonna die.
I know she is.

33:49.569 --> 33:50.695
Billy, look at me!

33:54.157 --> 33:55.408
I pulled you out
of the fire.

33:56.284 --> 33:58.869
The least you can do
is listen to what
I have to say.

34:07.421 --> 34:08.629
Okay. Okay.

34:13.510 --> 34:16.804
Listen, Victoria was raped.
So, whoever set that fire
was trying to kill her.

34:16.930 --> 34:18.723
That...
That wasn't me.
I swear. I swear.

34:18.807 --> 34:21.183
I know. I know.
So do the police.

34:22.686 --> 34:24.437
They do?
Yeah.

34:26.022 --> 34:27.815
So, grab the railing.

34:28.525 --> 34:31.819
Okay, okay.
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay.

34:35.031 --> 34:37.658
Okay, okay, okay...

34:40.287 --> 34:41.579
Okay, we're good.

34:46.668 --> 34:47.835
Gabby...

34:54.342 --> 34:55.509
You had me
worried there.

34:56.887 --> 34:58.429
I'm fine.

35:02.309 --> 35:03.768
Hell of a save, Dawson.

35:05.395 --> 35:06.812
Thanks a lot, Chief.

35:21.077 --> 35:22.411
Hey.
Hey.

35:25.540 --> 35:26.957
Is that Jergens?

35:27.709 --> 35:28.709
Maybe.

35:28.919 --> 35:31.045
I love that stuff.

35:31.296 --> 35:32.755
Why spend $50?

35:32.881 --> 35:34.632
Oh, I tell people
it's French.

35:36.092 --> 35:37.301
Me, too!

35:38.720 --> 35:39.720
Yeah.

35:41.681 --> 35:42.723
Yes!

35:45.519 --> 35:47.353
Do we go to Casey
about this?
No, no, no.

35:47.437 --> 35:48.854
Don't go over
Herrmann's head.

35:48.939 --> 35:51.440
He said keep an eye on him,
we'll keep an eye on him.

35:51.525 --> 35:53.442
If anything happens,
he'll make the
right move, right?

35:53.568 --> 35:55.820
Right.
Let's just see how
this plays out.

35:59.908 --> 36:02.576
I hear you two
chicken-heads have been
talking about something.

36:03.245 --> 36:04.620
What is it?

36:04.871 --> 36:06.330
It's private.
Nothing.

36:06.414 --> 36:09.208
If it's private, then why
have I heard about it?

36:11.753 --> 36:13.879
Why don't you tell me
what's going on?

36:17.717 --> 36:20.010
Okay, look.
I know you and Rice
go way back.

36:20.095 --> 36:23.222
So, I wouldn't say
anything if I wasn't
pretty positive, okay?

36:24.266 --> 36:26.350
First time, I didn't
think much about it.
Rice was laying back,

36:26.434 --> 36:28.018
looking for his
Denver Bar. Fine.

36:28.103 --> 36:31.772
Second time, on Wabash,
it was his SCBA.

36:32.399 --> 36:35.234
Now, afterwards,
Cruz did an 0800 on it.

36:35.318 --> 36:39.321
There was nothing wrong
with his mask, Lieutenant.
Nothing.

36:39.990 --> 36:41.532
You got a set of
balls on you, Otis.

36:41.616 --> 36:42.992
I'm just telling you
what I saw.

36:43.118 --> 36:44.869
You've been spreading
rumors about Rice

36:44.953 --> 36:46.662
since the first day he
set foot in this house.

36:46.788 --> 36:48.664
Look, Lieutenant...
No, you're way the
hell out of line.

36:48.748 --> 36:50.541
Severide, look...
I hear it again,

36:50.667 --> 36:52.626
you and me, we're
gonna have a problem.

36:59.050 --> 37:00.134
Excuse me.

37:35.921 --> 37:37.338
Hey.
Hi.

37:37.756 --> 37:39.924
That was great.
Um, thank you.

37:40.008 --> 37:43.385
Yeah, I like the, uh,
leg thing you did.

37:43.511 --> 37:45.638
I can teach you.
Oh, you don't
wanna see that.

37:45.722 --> 37:46.931
No?
I promise you.

37:47.015 --> 37:48.515
You really don't
wanna see that.

37:49.726 --> 37:51.518
Uh, I...
I'm looking for Jack.

37:51.603 --> 37:53.479
Are you gonna
take the gig?

37:53.563 --> 37:55.022
We'll see what happens.

38:11.873 --> 38:13.082
Everything okay in here?

38:13.959 --> 38:15.542
Hey, Casey, um...

38:17.504 --> 38:20.214
One sec, all right?
Meet me at the bar,
all right?

38:21.383 --> 38:22.424
Yeah.

38:33.520 --> 38:35.062
Hey, what's up?

38:35.188 --> 38:37.022
I'm gonna put my bid in
for that chain of clubs.

38:37.107 --> 38:38.399
Okay. Great.

38:39.859 --> 38:41.443
Come here a sec.

38:42.612 --> 38:45.197
I like you.
You do great work.

38:45.281 --> 38:47.783
You and me, we're gonna
make some money together.

38:48.493 --> 38:52.413
You stay at the bar,
all right? That's not
your area back there.

38:53.289 --> 38:55.124
I'm not sure
I understand.

38:56.751 --> 38:59.086
Okay,
I'll say it again.

38:59.629 --> 39:03.674
You do construction,
great. You flirt
with the girls, great.

39:04.009 --> 39:06.677
You wanna take
one of them home,
I don't give a damn.

39:06.761 --> 39:09.304
But don't come
looking for me
back there.

39:11.141 --> 39:12.474
Do me a favor, Jack.

39:12.600 --> 39:13.642
Hmm.

39:13.977 --> 39:16.603
Take your job
and piss off.

39:18.064 --> 39:20.983
Come on, Casey,
get over here.
Don't be like that.

39:21.526 --> 39:23.485
Listen, I'm finishing
the renovation.

39:23.570 --> 39:25.487
You pay me.
And we're done.

39:44.507 --> 39:45.716
Hi.

39:45.800 --> 39:47.134
Oh, Sergeant Benson.

39:47.886 --> 39:49.178
They're right in here.
Great, thank you.

39:49.262 --> 39:51.055
Oh, would you like me
to take your bag?

39:51.139 --> 39:52.598
Thank you.
No problem.

39:56.478 --> 39:57.853
Olivia.
Hank.

39:57.937 --> 39:59.605
Hey. This is Chief Boden.

39:59.731 --> 40:01.106
Thank you for
taking the time.

40:01.191 --> 40:04.234
Of course.
So, it's official.
OFI have ruled it an arson.

40:04.319 --> 40:05.402
Okay. The victim?

40:06.529 --> 40:08.614
She's still hanging on
at Chicago Med.

40:08.740 --> 40:10.657
They'll let us know
if she can talk.

40:13.495 --> 40:15.079
Do we know how
she was subdued?

40:15.163 --> 40:16.789
Yeah, skull fracture.
Back of the head.

40:19.667 --> 40:21.502
All right, this is gonna
sound odd, but was she

40:21.586 --> 40:23.712
wearing green nail polish
on her fingers?

40:23.963 --> 40:26.507
None that would be visible.
We know, from the finger line
on her forehead

40:26.591 --> 40:28.675
she was covering her face
during the blaze.

40:28.760 --> 40:31.011
So her hands bore
the brunt of it.

40:31.096 --> 40:32.304
Okay.

40:32.388 --> 40:34.848
Yeah, it's gonna take
additional testing.

40:34.974 --> 40:37.267
Okay, so, confirmed,
the victim is a nurse,

40:37.519 --> 40:41.730
5' 5", brown hair,
brown eyes,
and she was raped.

40:42.148 --> 40:43.357
That's right.

40:59.332 --> 41:01.625
Clear indication of
blunt force trauma
to the head.

41:01.709 --> 41:04.128
Might have knocked her out
before she was burned.

41:22.897 --> 41:24.648
So, the animal
that did this,

41:25.400 --> 41:26.817
you think he
did it before?

41:28.570 --> 41:30.070
Unfortunately,

41:31.114 --> 41:32.489
I know he has.
