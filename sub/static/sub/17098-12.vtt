Mr. Kim. It is me, Enrique.

00:07.959 --> 00:10.417
Yah, I know.
You don't have to announce.

00:10.917 --> 00:13.375
You've probably noticed,
I haven't been in much lately.

00:13.417 --> 00:14.834
No, not really.

00:15.625 --> 00:17.667
I know that is your
pride speaking.

00:17.709 --> 00:19.959
But, uh, this thing
between us,

00:20.583 --> 00:21.667
it must end.

00:22.083 --> 00:23.500
I don't know what you talking.

00:23.750 --> 00:26.625
I've chosen to end
my boycott of your store,

00:28.875 --> 00:30.625
Hurtful words have been said
on both sides.

00:30.667 --> 00:32.792
-I don't remember any words.
-On both sides.

00:33.875 --> 00:35.375
-So I am here to...
-Stop.

00:35.417 --> 00:36.542
What?

00:36.792 --> 00:37.875
Just stop.

00:39.208 --> 00:40.750
That's why I'm here.
To stop the feud. (CHUCKLES)

00:40.792 --> 00:41.834

lots of orange juice.

00:44.250 --> 00:46.667
No, I'm looking for a hug,
Mr. Kim.

00:46.959 --> 00:48.667
I want to bury the hatchet.

00:48.709 --> 00:49.750
Yah, I don't think so.

00:50.667 --> 00:52.542
I can wait here all day.

how that feels.

01:01.709 --> 01:03.500
Why you still doing then?

01:03.542 --> 01:05.291
How long have you
had that lump?

01:05.333 --> 01:06.875
"Lump"? Where?

01:07.667 --> 01:09.750
Right... Right here.
Does this hurt?

01:09.792 --> 01:11.542
-I'll palpate it.
-What? No PalPay.

01:11.583 --> 01:13.583
What did you PalPay?
I don't like a PalPay.

01:13.625 --> 01:15.750
No, "palpate" it.
It means to touch.

01:16.625 --> 01:17.917
Mr. Kim, I'm a nurse.

01:18.208 --> 01:20.375
And in my professional opinion
as a nurse,

01:20.667 --> 01:21.875
you should see a doctor.

Yes! I saw that very program.

Really?

04:54.250 --> 04:55.709
He was very chubby

04:55.750 --> 04:58.583
and he had a lump on his neck
the size of a plump melon.

04:58.625 --> 05:00.709
(CHUCKLES) And you saw what
happened when they tried to

05:00.750 --> 05:02.000
-remove it.
-He was happy.

05:02.041 --> 05:04.500
He hemorrhaged from
the severed blood vessels

05:04.542 --> 05:06.500
feeding that bocce-ball
sized lump.

different TV show.

of a baby's head.

05:20.083 --> 05:21.417
couldn't talk.

Couldn't have sex
with his wife.

one I talking about.

these things happen.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.083
Monday, we are on
the golf course.

he goes to the hospital

broke 80 that day.

to my attention that,

FYI, at the conference,

05:59.041 --> 06:00.166
there's a room.

06:00.750 --> 06:02.083
-A room?
-Yeah.

06:02.542 --> 06:04.500
Because most of the managers
are from out of town,

06:04.542 --> 06:05.875
they're all getting a room
at the hotel.

06:05.917 --> 06:07.500
And apparently,
that includes us.

06:08.208 --> 06:10.458
I mean, me. FYI.

06:10.500 --> 06:12.375
That's great.
I hear it's a great hotel.

06:12.667 --> 06:14.417
I know, right?
I thought about telling them

06:14.458 --> 06:16.458
that I don't need a room,
I mean, we live here.

06:17.208 --> 06:18.542
I live here.

06:18.583 --> 06:20.917
Oh, no, you should...
You should totally keep it.

06:21.291 --> 06:23.333
You never know when you're
going to need a room.

06:25.458 --> 06:28.959
In case you get tired
or need to iron something.

06:29.291 --> 06:30.959
Exactly. Or, or same for you.

06:31.333 --> 06:34.000
I mean not iron something, but
say you had too much to drink.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.375
I'm not saying you have
a drinking problem.

06:36.417 --> 06:37.917
I'm actually not even
allowed to ask.

06:37.959 --> 06:39.375
-I don't.
-And I didn't ask.

06:39.417 --> 06:41.667
But if you did have
a little too much to drink,

06:41.709 --> 06:43.583
you could take the room.
(CHUCKLES)

06:43.959 --> 06:45.041
Or you.

06:45.625 --> 06:47.375
Or you could take
the room is, is...

06:48.417 --> 06:50.333
-...what I'm saying.
-Yeah. Of course.

06:50.375 --> 06:51.583
That makes perfect sense.

06:51.959 --> 06:54.417
-Okay, back to work.
-Yeah.

07:04.542 --> 07:05.792
Oh. Where you coming from?

07:05.834 --> 07:07.208
Why are you reading
about lumps?

07:07.625 --> 07:09.250
-Who was?
-Someone was.

"Suspicious lumps,"
"irregular lumps,"

-"pregnant babes".
-Uh, that one just pop up.

what I tell you.

to tell you, now.

acting weird earlier.

07:36.250 --> 07:37.250
Mmm-hmm.

07:37.667 --> 07:39.875
-Is it cancer? Where is it?
-No, no.

07:39.917 --> 07:43.333
It's just a small lump
on back. Don't worry.

and most lumps
is just no big deal.

-Stop! Yeah.

not to tell.

09:36.959 --> 09:38.208
This...

09:39.041 --> 09:40.834
(MUMBLES)

09:42.875 --> 09:44.000
Hmm.

09:44.041 --> 09:45.917
-(GRUNTS)
-What is it?

09:46.750 --> 09:48.250
It's likely a fatty deposit.

09:49.208 --> 09:51.834
Why did you wait so long
to come in?

09:51.875 --> 09:53.834
Oh. That's a good question.

09:54.250 --> 09:55.333
Mrs. Kim?

09:55.625 --> 09:57.792
Why we not notice huge lump

09:57.834 --> 09:59.625
on your husband back
before now?

09:59.667 --> 10:01.583
I don't know.
Maybe because you

10:01.625 --> 10:04.709
always falling asleep before,
you know...

10:04.959 --> 10:06.959
-Bedtime.
-Okay, so no problem?

10:07.000 --> 10:09.291
No, it's also
very close to your spine,

10:09.333 --> 10:11.875
and I don't like that it got
this big, this fast.

10:11.917 --> 10:13.417
-So what we do?
-Remove it.

10:13.875 --> 10:15.917
I'll check to see if there's
an appointment later today.

10:15.959 --> 10:17.458
-Surgery?
-It's okay. I keep lump.

10:17.500 --> 10:19.667
I like lump. It's fine.
Hardly notice.

10:19.709 --> 10:21.083
-I notice.
-You not notice.

10:21.125 --> 10:23.125
-Enrique notice.
-Mr. Kim,

10:23.625 --> 10:25.041
these things
are unpredictable.

10:25.083 --> 10:27.083
I'd like to remove it,
and test it and make sure...

10:27.125 --> 10:28.959
Yah, but, uh, today, you know,

10:29.000 --> 10:30.375
-it's so busy.
-What time?

10:30.417 --> 10:32.208
My receptionist will call
you with a time.

10:32.250 --> 10:33.583
What, I don't get vote?

10:33.625 --> 10:36.375
-My back, my lump.
-We really need to do this.

10:36.834 --> 10:39.083
Yah, that thing look like
it have evil little face.

10:39.125 --> 10:40.625
Yah, now that you see.

10:41.125 --> 10:44.250
Maybe you get surgery
for your eye, huh?
Two for one.

10:44.291 --> 10:45.500
Argh! My lump!

10:53.083 --> 10:54.291
So?

10:54.333 --> 10:56.625
-Doctor say it's nothing.
-It's not nothing.

10:56.667 --> 10:58.959
-It's a big fat something.
-But is it benign?

10:59.000 --> 11:01.291
Yah, that's what I say.
It's nothing.

11:01.333 --> 11:03.875
Doctor say it's too close
to spine. Have to test.

11:03.917 --> 11:06.750
-So Appa have surgery today.
-What! Today?

11:07.250 --> 11:09.041
Okay, when do we
have to be there?

11:09.083 --> 11:10.917
You not going.
You go to award ceremony.

11:10.959 --> 11:12.917
No way. Not when you're
having surgery.

11:12.959 --> 11:15.375
Ah, look what you do.
Now Janet is a scare.

11:15.875 --> 11:16.875
This is a nothing.

11:18.125 --> 11:20.291
But your award is
very important. We all go.

11:20.333 --> 11:22.250
Maybe only award you ever win.

11:22.291 --> 11:24.417
Despite that comment, I still
want to go to the hospital.

11:24.458 --> 11:27.000
Okay, you go to hospital,
I go to award.

11:27.041 --> 11:28.166
Stop, stop, stop!

11:28.542 --> 11:30.875
You is go to surgery.
You is go to award.

11:30.917 --> 11:33.542
By the time you get home,

11:33.583 --> 11:35.625
Wait. Who watch store?

11:35.667 --> 11:37.792
-Oh, close store.
-We never close store

11:37.834 --> 11:39.834
-in 20 year.
-Lock door.

11:40.458 --> 11:42.709
How we go to hospital
if door is a lock?

11:43.041 --> 11:44.875
You go get your things

11:44.917 --> 11:46.208
Okay, okay.

11:46.583 --> 11:48.709
Too bad doctor can't
get you off my back.

11:55.917 --> 11:57.959
Are you kidding me?
Is he still looking at me?

11:58.000 --> 11:59.291
JUNG: Oh yeah.

11:59.333 --> 12:01.000
(SIGHS) I can't remember
his name. What's his name?

12:01.041 --> 12:02.166
Well, you've got about
nine seconds,

12:02.208 --> 12:03.458
'cause he's headed over
right now.

12:03.500 --> 12:04.917
I'm totally blanking.
Do me a huge favour,

12:04.959 --> 12:07.250
-introduce yourself.
-He looks like a Fred.

12:07.291 --> 12:09.792
Or possibly... Ned?

12:09.834 --> 12:12.083
-I hate you so much right now.
-He's right behind you.

12:12.542 --> 12:14.250
-Hi, Jung Kim.
-Hey!

12:15.166 --> 12:16.417
(CHUCKLES)

12:17.166 --> 12:19.542
-You're going to pay for that.
-(PHONE RINGS)

12:21.250 --> 12:23.041
Do you want anything?
I'm going to go get a drink.

12:23.083 --> 12:24.875
Sure.
I'll have what you're having.

12:28.917 --> 12:30.208
Hey.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.750
I've been trying to reach you
for the last hour.

12:31.792 --> 12:33.291
I'm at a work thing.
What's up?

12:33.875 --> 12:35.917
<i>-Appa's in the hospital.</i>
-What?

12:35.959 --> 12:37.291
<i>You should go check on him.</i>

12:37.834 --> 12:39.166
NURSE: It's almost time.

12:42.083 --> 12:43.917
Oh! What's wrong?

12:43.959 --> 12:46.709
Nothing! (CHUCKLES)
She always worry about me.

12:47.667 --> 12:49.583
Okay, go. I see you after.

12:51.625 --> 12:53.792
This surgery very safe, yeah?

12:54.125 --> 12:55.959
Very safe.
It's a simple procedure.

12:56.792 --> 12:58.375
That's what they say
to Mr. Singh.

12:58.417 --> 13:01.417
He go from hole-in-one
to hole in ground in one week.

13:01.458 --> 13:04.166
He have a triple
bypass surgery, Appa!

13:04.208 --> 13:05.875
It's all going to be fine.
You're in good hands

13:05.917 --> 13:07.875
-with Dr. Peterson.
-She is professional.

13:08.333 --> 13:10.625
Okay, but tell
to me one thing.

13:10.959 --> 13:12.125
If a lump is on back,

13:12.375 --> 13:13.875
why I have to take off pants?

13:13.917 --> 13:15.083
(GIGGLES)

13:15.875 --> 13:16.792
<i>Sarang hae.</i>

13:17.792 --> 13:18.792
<i>Na do.</i>

13:22.166 --> 13:24.291
Pants is a basic human right!

13:28.291 --> 13:30.417
-His name's Alan.
-Who?

13:30.750 --> 13:33.291
"Ned, Fred" is Alan.
Carrie told me.

13:33.333 --> 13:34.333
Oh!

13:34.959 --> 13:36.125
Is something wrong?

13:37.083 --> 13:39.083
It's my dad.
He's at the hospital.

13:39.667 --> 13:40.667
For real.

13:40.917 --> 13:42.291
What do you mean, "for real"?

13:42.333 --> 13:44.542
Just, that he's really
at the hospital.

13:45.250 --> 13:46.250
What is it?

13:46.834 --> 13:48.125
Hopefully it's no big deal,
but he's

13:48.542 --> 13:51.125
getting a lump removed.
They're not sure what it is.

13:51.583 --> 13:53.166
Wow. Your parents have had

13:53.208 --> 13:55.291
a rough year for
health scares.

13:56.083 --> 13:57.542
Yeah.

13:57.583 --> 14:00.417
Your mom's heart condition
and fever and now your dad...

14:01.709 --> 14:03.083
-Right.
-Yeah.

14:03.959 --> 14:05.959
-He is sick.
-I never said he wasn't.

14:07.667 --> 14:09.208
I just feel like
I should be there.

14:09.250 --> 14:10.792
And Janet says
she can't go, so...

14:10.834 --> 14:12.083
You should go.

14:13.458 --> 14:14.500
I'll call you.

14:15.458 --> 14:16.583
Sure.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
I, I can't sell you
any more eggs, Mr. Petrenko.

14:26.333 --> 14:27.875
Well, that's racist.

14:27.917 --> 14:31.000
It's not racist. I mean, look,
I just sold you a dozen eggs,

14:31.041 --> 14:33.166
and then I watched you
walk outside and throw them

14:33.208 --> 14:35.250
at a cyclist, a cab,
and a streetcar.

14:35.291 --> 14:36.959
Well, that's because they
think they're better than me.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.625
The streetcar thinks
it's better than you?

14:38.667 --> 14:40.959
So, you already heard.

14:42.041 --> 14:43.959
I'm not selling you
any more eggs.

14:44.250 --> 14:46.500
(STAMMERING) Is there anything
else I can get for you?

14:47.125 --> 14:48.125
Nope.

14:50.375 --> 14:52.709
-Oh. Wow.
-Oh! (SNICKERS) Thanks.

14:52.959 --> 14:53.959
And thanks for coming with me.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.542
Hey, probably the only chance

14:55.583 --> 14:57.083
I'll get to go to
a dean's dinner.

14:57.458 --> 14:58.542
Sorry, we're closing early.

14:58.583 --> 15:00.083
Oh, I just need
some tomato sauce.

15:00.125 --> 15:01.917
Uh, preferably with no garlic.

15:01.959 --> 15:05.458
Oh, and also
some ladyfingers.
Again, no garlic.

15:05.709 --> 15:07.000
I don't think they come
with garlic.

15:07.041 --> 15:08.208
Oh, okay, thanks.

15:08.250 --> 15:09.458
-(DOOR OPENING)
-Oh!

15:09.875 --> 15:11.291
Hey, do you guys
got sour cream?

15:12.166 --> 15:12.917
In the back.

15:14.083 --> 15:15.083
You go.

15:15.500 --> 15:16.917
Get our seats. I'll catch up.

15:16.959 --> 15:19.917
-Are you sure? I can stay.
-I'll be right there.

15:24.041 --> 15:27.000
Did I say sour cream?
I meant sunscreen.

15:34.125 --> 15:36.166
-Who you is?
-Sarah. I'm your nurse.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.041
We've spoken many times.

15:38.333 --> 15:40.041
-How you feeling?
-Good.

15:40.667 --> 15:42.834
-When we do surgery?
-You're all done.

15:43.083 --> 15:44.333
Everything looks great.

15:44.625 --> 15:46.542
-Aye.
-(CHUCKLES)

15:49.291 --> 15:50.625
(DOOR OPENING)

15:50.917 --> 15:52.542
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

16:02.208 --> 16:03.959
-What you doing?
-Ah.

16:04.542 --> 16:05.875
I thought you were sleeping.

16:05.917 --> 16:06.959
(GRUNTS) You see your Umma?

16:08.125 --> 16:09.083
She just here.

16:10.959 --> 16:12.875
(GRUNTS) Come. Sit.

16:13.709 --> 16:16.875
Have a pudding.
It's banana. (CHUCKLES)

16:16.917 --> 16:18.208
Thanks, I'm good.

16:18.250 --> 16:21.500
There's no crust, but
it tastes like cream pie.

16:21.834 --> 16:23.125
How they do that, huh?

16:23.166 --> 16:24.792
-Here, eat.
-No, I'm okay.

16:25.417 --> 16:28.125
Ah, try one bite.
You should love it.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.625
Hmm? Hmm?

16:31.917 --> 16:34.083
Yeah. (CHUCKLES)

16:35.333 --> 16:36.417
Hey.

16:36.959 --> 16:38.834
Who ate my banana pudding cup?

16:39.333 --> 16:41.250
So, how you feeling?

16:42.000 --> 16:44.250
Really good. (CHUCKLES)

16:44.625 --> 16:47.500
Now I know why
you always smoking marijuana.

16:47.542 --> 16:48.917
-I wasn't always...
-(CHUCKLING)

16:51.375 --> 16:53.041
So, did they remove the lump?

16:53.333 --> 16:56.208
Hmm. That's what they tell me.
I don't see it anywhere.

16:56.959 --> 16:59.083
(CHUCKLES) Oh, Mr. Mehta,

16:59.625 --> 17:04.041
he tell me funny story about
a man who have lump on back

17:04.083 --> 17:06.375
that slowly move to front.
Huh? (CHUCKLES)

17:07.583 --> 17:10.834
Three boob is one
too many boob. (CHUCKLES)

17:12.250 --> 17:13.959
Well, it's good
seeing you, Appa.

17:14.500 --> 17:16.792
You was, uh, four
or five-year-old

17:17.291 --> 17:19.834
when we take out appendix.

17:22.041 --> 17:23.291
I take you to hospital.

17:24.417 --> 17:26.166
Have to stay here three days,

17:26.208 --> 17:29.333
sleeping in chair beside you.
Just like this.

17:32.083 --> 17:34.375
Only time we ever
close the store.

17:35.125 --> 17:36.917
Over 20 year ago.

17:38.041 --> 17:39.625
You stayed here
for three days?

17:40.000 --> 17:41.917
Hmm. Had no choice.

17:42.542 --> 17:44.208
You wouldn't let go
of my hand.

17:45.875 --> 17:48.166
(SIGHS) They give to you
pudding back then too.

17:48.208 --> 17:51.041
But, uh, only tapioca.

17:51.083 --> 17:53.959
Not as good as a banana.
(CHUCKLES)

17:56.792 --> 17:57.792
You know, Appa,

17:59.375 --> 18:01.041
it's been a long time,
but, uh...

18:02.375 --> 18:04.458
I just want you
to know that...

18:06.959 --> 18:07.792
(SNICKERS)

18:10.041 --> 18:11.667
(FOLK MUSIC PLAYING)

18:26.208 --> 18:27.208
How you feeling?

18:28.709 --> 18:30.834
Like a weight off my shoulder,
and a lump off of my back.

18:30.875 --> 18:32.041
(BOTH LAUGHING)

18:32.500 --> 18:33.667
Your son seems nice.

18:35.583 --> 18:37.166
Your son, earlier.

18:37.583 --> 18:38.709
Jung was here?

18:38.750 --> 18:40.834
I... I didn't get his name.

18:41.291 --> 18:44.667
No, you was the only one here.
We talk about pudding.

18:44.917 --> 18:46.834
I don't think you and I
ever talked about pudding.

18:47.333 --> 18:49.250
Although if we were going to,
chocolate's my favourite.

18:51.500 --> 18:53.166
Chocolate is boring.

18:53.875 --> 18:54.834
Appa!

18:54.875 --> 18:56.166
We talk about pudding?

18:56.959 --> 18:59.667
Why we talk about pudding?
Put on the pants!

19:11.834 --> 19:12.834
(DOOR OPENING)

19:15.333 --> 19:17.166
Janet, look who is a survive.

19:17.208 --> 19:18.834
Okay, okay, enough.

19:19.834 --> 19:22.208
(SIGHS) We selling flower now?

19:22.500 --> 19:24.750
Word got out and I guess
people were worried about you.

19:25.375 --> 19:27.583
There's two "get well" cards,

19:27.625 --> 19:29.834
a "thinking of you"
and one "sorry for your loss".

19:30.417 --> 19:31.667
I think that was a mistake.

19:32.333 --> 19:34.250
-This is all from customer?
-Yeah.

19:35.208 --> 19:36.750
How was award?
You get picture?

19:36.792 --> 19:38.458
-You show us!
-Yeah, yeah. Later.

19:39.333 --> 19:40.750
-I go make some tea, huh?
-Hmm.

19:48.041 --> 19:50.792
-You didn't go.
-We don't close the store.

19:51.542 --> 19:53.792
-You just stubborn.
-You stubborn.

19:53.834 --> 19:55.041
(GRUMBLES)

19:56.750 --> 19:58.500
-You want to see scar?
-No!

19:58.542 --> 20:00.625
-Then stop looking at me.
-(SCOFFS)

20:03.041 --> 20:05.875
Here, it's for you. Sort of
a welcome-home present.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.667
Someone told me
you really liked them.

20:08.709 --> 20:10.542
-Oh, yeah! You have to try!
-(CHUCKLES)

20:10.583 --> 20:13.750
It's a banana
flavour explosion!
(CHUCKLES)

20:15.959 --> 20:17.375
(SLURPS)

20:18.875 --> 20:19.875
-Hmm.
-(SLURPS)

20:21.166 --> 20:23.208
It's not the same
without the morphine.

20:23.709 --> 20:25.375
-Mmm, nothing ever is. Uh-huh.
-Hmm.

20:25.750 --> 20:27.667
(SLURPING)

20:35.583 --> 20:36.875
-Hey.
-Hi.

20:37.500 --> 20:38.959
How's your dad?

20:39.000 --> 20:41.208
Good, good. I'm glad I went.
It was good.

20:41.917 --> 20:43.333
How was the rest
of your night?

20:43.375 --> 20:45.375
It was good.
I had a really good time.

20:45.417 --> 20:47.750
I met some people. (SNICKERS)

20:48.875 --> 20:51.208
I wish I'd been able to stay,
'cause it was really nice

20:51.250 --> 20:53.583
hanging out with you.
Outside of work.

20:54.333 --> 20:56.000
Yeah. Good.

20:59.083 --> 21:00.041
Was there anything else?

21:00.458 --> 21:02.375
Uh, nope. Just saying "hey".

21:03.750 --> 21:05.792
Well, back to it.

21:09.667 --> 21:12.291
Yeah, okay. See you.
