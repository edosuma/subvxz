00:06.440 --> 00:07.341
- In the criminal
justice system,

00:09.843 --> 00:11.812
sexually-based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:11.845 --> 00:14.315
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:14.348 --> 00:16.184
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:16.217 --> 00:17.551
are members of an elite squad

00:17.585 --> 00:19.553
known as
the special victims unit.

00:19.587 --> 00:21.455
These are their stories.

00:21.489 --> 00:23.257
[dramatic musical sting]

00:23.291 --> 00:25.226
- Last chance.
I can still pick up some steaks,

00:25.259 --> 00:26.494
crack open
a nice bottle of wine.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.496
- Steven, we do that
all the time.

00:28.529 --> 00:31.065
- Oh, well, call me crazy,
but I like hanging out at home

00:31.099 --> 00:33.467
with you.
- I know you don't get it,

00:33.501 --> 00:35.636
but I need to do this...

00:35.669 --> 00:37.338
For me.

00:38.506 --> 00:40.541
And everyone says it's amazing.

00:40.574 --> 00:43.544
- Do what you have to do,
but if you change your mind,

00:43.577 --> 00:45.246
I'll happily make room
for you on the couch.

00:45.279 --> 00:47.381
- I'll see you tomorrow.

00:54.888 --> 00:57.191
**

00:57.225 --> 00:59.059
De Anima.

01:04.132 --> 01:05.433
[elevator dings]

01:10.338 --> 01:12.072
- De Anima?

01:25.453 --> 01:28.422
[exotic music plays]

01:28.456 --> 01:31.259
**

01:31.292 --> 01:33.394
- How's it going, everyone?

01:33.427 --> 01:34.895
I'm Declan,

01:34.928 --> 01:38.432
and, uh, I'm thrilled
that you're all here.

01:38.466 --> 01:40.501
How 'bout we start?

01:42.703 --> 01:44.572
And don't worry,

01:44.605 --> 01:46.174
I always get
a little nervous too.

01:46.207 --> 01:47.608
[light laughter]

02:01.389 --> 02:03.591
My friends,
we're here to take

02:03.624 --> 02:05.659
an amazing journey.

02:07.595 --> 02:11.465
One that will connect you
to your deeper self...

02:15.503 --> 02:17.405
And to each other.

02:20.674 --> 02:23.277
And if you open
your souls to it,

02:24.678 --> 02:28.682
tonight will change your life.

02:33.721 --> 02:35.756
- Buckle your seatbelt.

02:35.789 --> 02:39.493
- Here's to nothing.
- You mean here's to everything.

02:47.401 --> 02:48.502
- No, no, no, no,
this is a bad idea.

02:48.536 --> 02:49.970
Let's just go.
I'll be okay.

02:50.003 --> 02:52.573
- No, no,
we're doing this, okay?

02:52.606 --> 02:54.275
Wait here.

02:57.445 --> 02:59.947
- Here it is.
- Uh, excuse me?

02:59.980 --> 03:03.551
- Hi, can I help you?
- Yeah, my girlfriend, Abby--

03:03.584 --> 03:05.586
I think she was raped.

03:05.619 --> 03:08.222
- Okay, I'm sorry to hear that.
- She's kind of in shock.

03:08.256 --> 03:09.690
She went to this spiritual
retreat last night.

03:09.723 --> 03:11.425
That's where it happened.

03:11.459 --> 03:13.394
- Okay, well,
you did the right thing

03:13.427 --> 03:15.729
by bringing her here.
- Yeah, she's--she's out here.

03:16.330 --> 03:18.766
- Abby?

03:18.799 --> 03:21.469
I'm Lieutenant Benson.

03:21.502 --> 03:23.437
Your boyfriend said that--

03:23.471 --> 03:25.406
that you think you were
sexually assaulted last night?

03:25.439 --> 03:27.441
- [sobbing] I can't believe
I even went to that thing.

03:27.475 --> 03:29.443
I should've known better.

03:29.477 --> 03:31.745
- Okay, the only person to blame
is the one who did this to you.

03:31.779 --> 03:34.515
So do you--do you know
who that is?

03:34.548 --> 03:36.784
- Yeah.

03:36.817 --> 03:39.653
His name's Declan Trask.

03:39.687 --> 03:41.622
He's a--

03:41.655 --> 03:43.624
he's a healer.

03:44.725 --> 03:48.296
He was supposed to
change my life.

03:48.329 --> 03:51.365
- [inhales, exhales slowly]

03:54.368 --> 03:57.338
[dramatic music]

03:57.371 --> 04:04.412
*

04:40.013 --> 04:42.350
- I was at an Ayahuasca retreat.

04:42.383 --> 04:44.017
- I'm sorry?
A what retreat?

04:44.051 --> 04:45.819
- Ayahuasca.
It's a drug from Peru.

04:45.853 --> 04:48.088
It's been a big thing.
Causes hallucinations

04:48.121 --> 04:51.459
that are supposed to give you
insights to life.

04:51.492 --> 04:53.327
- That's why I went.

04:53.361 --> 04:56.029
I was trying to figure
some stuff out, you know.

04:56.063 --> 04:58.832
- Uh, you were on, um, Ayahuasca
when you were assaulted?

04:58.866 --> 05:00.434
- No, I didn't take it.

05:00.468 --> 05:02.703
I got scared.

05:02.736 --> 05:05.839
- Okay, so when was the assault?

05:05.873 --> 05:07.375
- Probably around 12:30.

05:07.408 --> 05:09.377
- And what is the meditation
room exactly?

05:09.410 --> 05:14.081
- It's a white bedroom
with yoga mats.

05:14.114 --> 05:18.986
While everyone was tripping,
I went in there to be alone.

05:19.019 --> 05:20.854
That's where Declan found me.

05:20.888 --> 05:24.124
- Okay, and Declan Trask
runs these retreats?

05:24.157 --> 05:27.027
- Yeah, he's supposed to be

05:27.060 --> 05:29.797
the best at guiding people
while they take the drug.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.399
- What happened next?

05:31.432 --> 05:33.734
- He gave me a cup of water,

05:33.767 --> 05:35.736
and I felt really strange
after drinking it.

05:35.769 --> 05:38.872
- Strange how?
- Like I was dizzy.

05:38.906 --> 05:40.908
I--I couldn't think straight.

05:40.941 --> 05:43.711
My--my limbs went really heavy.

05:43.744 --> 05:46.079
- Okay, do you think he put
Ayahuasca in the water?

05:46.113 --> 05:47.881
- No, no, no,
I would've seen it or tasted it.

05:47.915 --> 05:49.717
It's like a thick brown sludge.

05:49.750 --> 05:52.019
- So maybe he put
another drug in there?

05:52.052 --> 05:53.721
- He must have.

05:53.754 --> 05:56.490
It was like I was in
another place, or realm.

05:56.524 --> 06:01.895
I--he just kept
talking and talking.

06:01.929 --> 06:04.131
The next thing I knew,
he had my pants down.

06:04.164 --> 06:05.833
He was inside me.

06:05.866 --> 06:08.436
- And you did not consent
to any of this?

06:08.469 --> 06:11.805
- No, I was so disoriented.
It was like I--

06:11.839 --> 06:13.974
I wanted to scream
and tell him to get off of me,

06:14.007 --> 06:16.844
and I couldn't,
like I was paralyzed.

06:16.877 --> 06:19.713
It was awful
feeling so powerless.

06:19.747 --> 06:21.114
- I'm so sorry.

06:23.884 --> 06:26.487
- I told everyone
that I was going,

06:28.021 --> 06:30.424
that it was going to be
this amazing

06:30.458 --> 06:32.092
life-altering experience.

06:32.125 --> 06:34.061
- Well, you couldn't have
known this was gonna happen.

06:34.094 --> 06:36.129
- So Abby, right now I think we
should get you to the hospital

06:36.163 --> 06:38.999
to do a rape kit
and a tox screen, okay?

06:39.967 --> 06:43.003
You're all right.

06:43.036 --> 06:46.173
- So I get to Peru,
and I'm broken--

06:46.206 --> 06:48.909
I mean, a mess of a human.

06:48.942 --> 06:50.878
And my guide there asks me,

06:50.911 --> 06:53.881
"Who do you expect to find
on the other side?"

06:53.914 --> 06:57.184
And the sad thing is
I had no idea.

06:57.217 --> 06:58.852
Now I want you do me a favor.

06:58.886 --> 07:00.921
When you go home tonight,

07:00.954 --> 07:02.189
I want you to look
in the mirror,

07:02.222 --> 07:04.892
and I mean really look.

07:04.925 --> 07:07.227
And I want you to ask yourself,

07:07.260 --> 07:10.030
are you realizing
your fullest potential?

07:10.063 --> 07:11.799
- Why do I get the feeling
this guy's shoes

07:11.832 --> 07:13.967
cost more than my rent?
- Because they do.

07:14.001 --> 07:15.503
Dude comes from real money.

07:15.536 --> 07:17.571
His dad's that hedge fund guy,
Tate Trask.

07:17.605 --> 07:19.239
- And look what I pulled.

07:19.272 --> 07:21.509
- "From notorious party boy

07:21.542 --> 07:24.011
"to Shaman of
the rich and famous,

07:24.044 --> 07:25.546
"Declan Trask changed his life,

07:25.579 --> 07:26.947
"and now he wants to
change yours.

07:26.980 --> 07:29.182
"A host of followers who pay

07:29.216 --> 07:32.786
$5,000 for a weekend with him
say that he can."

07:32.820 --> 07:34.054
- There's a sucker born
every minute.

07:34.087 --> 07:36.023
- Yeah, but everybody
needs something.

07:36.056 --> 07:39.259
My ex made me go on a Reiki
retreat to clear my energy.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.061
- And how'd that work out
for ya?

07:41.094 --> 07:43.196
- It made me realize
it was time for us to break up.

07:43.230 --> 07:45.265
- [laughs] Okay.
- [chuckles]

07:45.298 --> 07:46.600
- You ever do anything
like that, Liv?

07:46.634 --> 07:48.569
- Uh, no.
Anyone who claims

07:48.602 --> 07:51.004
that they can change your life
in a weekend can't.

07:51.038 --> 07:53.173
So Rollins and Carisi,
talk to the Shaman

07:53.206 --> 07:54.942
to get his side of the story.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.977
*

07:57.010 --> 07:59.112
- Hey, if this is about
the Ayahuasca,

07:59.146 --> 08:01.949
I'm licensed to distribute it
as part of a religious ceremony,

08:01.982 --> 08:04.918
The Church of Brazil.
I know it sounds ridiculous.

08:04.952 --> 08:07.254
- We're not here
about the drugs, Mr. Trask.

08:07.287 --> 08:09.890
- Do you know her?
- Well, that's Abby,

08:09.923 --> 08:12.626
Abby Clarke.
She came to one of my retreats.

08:12.660 --> 08:16.163
Is she okay?
- She was sexually assaulted.

08:16.196 --> 08:18.065
- What? Oh, that's awful.

08:18.098 --> 08:20.233
When did that happen?
- The night of your retreat.

08:20.267 --> 08:22.135
In fact, she says
it happened right here.

08:22.169 --> 08:24.104
- And do you know
anything about that?

08:24.137 --> 08:26.574
- Mm, no.

08:26.607 --> 08:27.975
Well, I hope
she's not suggesting

08:28.008 --> 08:29.242
that what we did together--

08:29.276 --> 08:31.679
- What--what did
you two do together?

08:31.712 --> 08:33.313
- We had sex.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.082
But I don't--I don't know

08:35.115 --> 08:37.150
how she could possibly
think it was rape.

08:37.184 --> 08:39.587
I mean, there's gotta be
some misunderstanding.

08:39.620 --> 08:41.221
- Okay, so help us clear it up.
What happened in your words?

08:41.254 --> 08:43.090
- Well, Abby didn't wanna
take the Ayahuasca.

08:43.123 --> 08:44.692
You know, it can be
intimidating for beginners.

08:44.725 --> 08:46.159
I totally understand that.

08:46.193 --> 08:48.562
So I just sat with her
for a while.

08:48.596 --> 08:51.064
We meditated, and then talked.

08:51.098 --> 08:53.100
- And had sex?
- Well, uh, yeah.

08:53.133 --> 08:54.167
I--I'd like to think
it was a little more

08:54.201 --> 08:55.903
meaningful than that.

08:55.936 --> 08:57.938
- True love?
Is that what you're saying?

08:57.971 --> 09:00.608
- Uh, I'm saying,
like, I liked her,

09:00.641 --> 09:03.043
she liked me, and,
you know, we connected.

09:03.076 --> 09:04.712
I'm truly baffled.

09:04.745 --> 09:06.079
I--I don't know if she had
a change of heart,

09:06.113 --> 09:07.715
or if she feels guilty,

09:07.748 --> 09:10.150
but in that moment,
um, there's no doubt.

09:10.183 --> 09:12.653
We had really positive
consensual sex,

09:12.686 --> 09:14.688
and she said yes.
- She said yes?

09:14.722 --> 09:16.189
All right, well, that doesn't
really mean a whole lot

09:16.223 --> 09:18.291
when a woman's incapacitated.

09:18.325 --> 09:19.627
- Mm, what are
you talking about?

09:19.660 --> 09:21.228
- Abby thinks she was drugged.

09:21.261 --> 09:23.697
- What? By me?
That's ridiculous.

09:23.731 --> 09:25.699
- [chuckles] Really? Really?
It's ridiculous to think

09:25.733 --> 09:27.100
that a man who gives out
drugs for a living

09:27.134 --> 09:29.036
might actually drug somebody?

09:29.069 --> 09:31.204
- I would never drug someone
without their knowledge, ever.

09:31.238 --> 09:33.741
- So just to be clear,
you didn't put anything

09:33.774 --> 09:36.043
into Abby's water?
- No.

09:36.076 --> 09:38.211
- Well, Abby says she was
drugged in the meditation room,

09:38.245 --> 09:40.113
so maybe you can show us that?
We'll take a look around?

09:40.147 --> 09:43.183
- Not a problem.
Come right this way.

09:43.216 --> 09:46.754
We had a moment of passion,
of spiritual connectivity.

09:46.787 --> 09:48.656
- That's not how Abby
felt about it.

09:48.689 --> 09:50.357
- But if you're so confident
nothing illegal happened here,

09:50.390 --> 09:52.993
then you won't mind giving us
a sample of your DNA, right?

09:53.026 --> 09:54.662
- Sure.
- We'll also need all the names

09:54.695 --> 09:57.130
of the people that were at
your retreat last night.

09:57.164 --> 09:58.966
- [sighs] Names?
Look, I'm sorry,

09:58.999 --> 10:00.333
but my clients come to me

10:00.367 --> 10:02.069
with a certain
expectation of privacy,

10:02.102 --> 10:03.737
and I can't betray that.

10:03.771 --> 10:05.973
- That's fine.
We'll get a warrant.

10:08.375 --> 10:10.210
- The retreat was fantastic.

10:10.243 --> 10:12.680
I feel like
I'm a different woman;

10:12.713 --> 10:15.148
I feel like
I see things differently.

10:15.182 --> 10:18.185
Before I met Declan,
there was a void.

10:18.218 --> 10:20.253
It was like
something was missing.

10:20.287 --> 10:22.055
- Well, you're not
missing a view.

10:22.089 --> 10:24.725
This place is something else.
- Thank you.

10:24.758 --> 10:27.094
So why are you here?

10:27.127 --> 10:28.996
- There was an incident
that took place

10:29.029 --> 10:30.397
with one of the guests.

10:30.430 --> 10:33.100
Abby Clarke.
- Oh, yes.

10:33.133 --> 10:36.303
Oh, she was the one
that Declan was obsessed with.

10:36.336 --> 10:39.306
He kept talking with her;
he kept asking her questions.

10:39.339 --> 10:42.042
- And when was this?
- I would say around 8:00,

10:42.075 --> 10:44.011
right before we took
our Ayahuasca journey.

10:44.044 --> 10:46.714
- Do you remember them together
after your journey?

10:46.747 --> 10:48.348
- Oh, I could not tell you
anything about that,

10:48.381 --> 10:52.219
but what I do remember
is this amazing vision.

10:52.252 --> 10:56.423
So I was walking on
this clear blue sea

10:56.456 --> 10:58.726
with the almighty mother plant,

10:58.759 --> 11:03.196
and this giant owl
is flying overhead.

11:03.230 --> 11:05.733
It's just--just hovering,

11:05.766 --> 11:08.068
just watching.

11:08.101 --> 11:09.837
And then when I got closer,

11:09.870 --> 11:15.142
I realized the owl
was actually me.

11:15.175 --> 11:17.177
- Okay.

11:17.210 --> 11:20.147
I'm happy for you.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.448
- Yeah, I remember Abby.

11:21.481 --> 11:24.117
She decided not to drink
the magic tea.

11:24.151 --> 11:26.754
Wish I did the same.
I spent half the night puking.

11:26.787 --> 11:28.288
- You remember
spending any time alone

11:28.321 --> 11:30.257
with, uh, Declan Trask?

11:30.290 --> 11:32.860
- Let's just say the Shaman
focused most of his soul-mending

11:32.893 --> 11:35.295
on the good looking ladies,
especially Abby.

11:35.328 --> 11:37.497
- Do you remember her going
into the meditation room

11:37.530 --> 11:39.466
around midnight?
- Yeah.

11:39.499 --> 11:41.501
Uh, I was sitting near Declan,
and he mentioned

11:41.534 --> 11:43.804
he was disappointed
she didn't take the Ayahuasca.

11:43.837 --> 11:45.739
- He was disappointed?
- He said he wanted to make sure

11:45.773 --> 11:47.440
she got her money's worth,
whatever that means.

11:47.474 --> 11:49.309
Next thing I know, he's walking
into the meditation room

11:49.342 --> 11:51.144
with a glass of water.

11:51.178 --> 11:52.345
- You see him put anything
in that glass of water?

11:52.379 --> 11:54.081
- No, but he could've.

11:54.114 --> 11:55.382
If you ask me,
the guy's a con artist,

11:55.415 --> 11:57.117
total waste of time and money.

11:57.150 --> 11:58.786
- Did you see either of them
leave that room?

11:58.819 --> 12:00.253
- Nah, I was too busy
horking in the bathroom

12:00.287 --> 12:02.189
to see much of anything.

12:02.222 --> 12:04.091
You're not gonna bust me for
doing the Ayahuasca, are you?

12:04.124 --> 12:05.759
- No, no, you're good.

12:05.793 --> 12:08.428
Sounds like you already
paid the piper for that.

12:08.461 --> 12:10.197
*

12:10.230 --> 12:11.398
- I just wanna tell these people

12:11.431 --> 12:13.266
how good my burger was
last night.

12:13.300 --> 12:15.102
- [chuckles] I actually
ate here last week.

12:15.135 --> 12:17.805
The raw Portobello fries?
They're not so bad.

12:17.838 --> 12:19.807
- Since when are you
a raw food guy?

12:19.840 --> 12:21.474
- I'm trying new things.
- Ah.

12:21.508 --> 12:23.844
You ever gonna bring her around?

12:24.845 --> 12:26.446
- Hi, I'm Valerie.

12:26.479 --> 12:28.481
You wanted to talk about
Declan's retreat?

12:28.515 --> 12:30.417
- Yeah, yeah,
I'm, uh, Detective Rollins.

12:30.450 --> 12:32.385
This is Detective Carisi.
- Yeah, we were just wondering

12:32.419 --> 12:34.822
if you saw or heard anything
out of the ordinary last night?

12:34.855 --> 12:37.324
- Well, it was, uh,
definitely out of the ordinary.

12:37.357 --> 12:39.326
Ayahuasca always is.

12:39.359 --> 12:41.094
- Uh, do you remember
seeing Declan, uh, Trask

12:41.128 --> 12:43.163
go into the meditation room
maybe around midnight?

12:43.196 --> 12:45.432
- I--I think
I remember him leaving.

12:45.465 --> 12:47.334
Yeah, I--I walked by.

12:47.367 --> 12:50.838
There was this woman, Abby,
sitting alone inside.

12:50.871 --> 12:52.405
She was crying.

12:52.439 --> 12:54.808
- Did you talk to her,
uh, to see what was wrong?

12:54.842 --> 12:57.110
- I just assumed
they were cathartic tears.

12:57.144 --> 12:58.846
- Uh, cathartic tears?

12:58.879 --> 13:01.581
- Well, half of us were crying
from the Ayahuasca.

13:01.614 --> 13:06.119
It provides this beautiful,
joyous pain,

13:06.153 --> 13:08.355
you know what I mean?
- I don't.

13:08.388 --> 13:10.924
- Oh, you're a skeptic.
That's--that's fine.

13:10.958 --> 13:12.826
- When was the last time
you saw Abby?

13:12.860 --> 13:15.395
- Mm, 20 minutes later.
She was leaving.

13:15.428 --> 13:17.130
- And how'd she seem to you?

13:17.164 --> 13:21.134
- Actually,
she was upset, angry.

13:21.168 --> 13:23.203
- Guess her pain
wasn't so joyous, huh?

13:23.971 --> 13:25.405
According to witnesses,

13:25.438 --> 13:27.140
Trask had his eye on Abby
the whole night.

13:27.174 --> 13:28.208
- And he was hellbent
on getting her

13:28.241 --> 13:29.576
to take that drug too.

13:29.609 --> 13:31.444
- Okay, so he gets
a vulnerable woman,

13:31.478 --> 13:33.280
convinces her to trust him,

13:33.313 --> 13:34.882
drugs her,
and then he assaults her.

13:34.915 --> 13:36.583
- Wouldn't be the first
to utilize that game plan.

13:36.616 --> 13:38.618
- Rape kit
and the tox results are in.

13:38.651 --> 13:41.955
Semen is a match to Trask,
but there's a problem, Liv.

13:41.989 --> 13:43.390
- What's up?

13:43.423 --> 13:46.526
- No drugs, no Ayahuasca,
no alcohol.

13:46.559 --> 13:48.862
- So Abby's story
doesn't add up.

13:51.932 --> 13:53.566
What are we missing?

14:00.040 --> 14:00.240
.

14:00.273 --> 14:01.041
- So Abby, we got
your tox screen back,

14:02.575 --> 14:04.912
and it came back negative.

14:06.579 --> 14:08.581
- What?
No drugs?

14:08.615 --> 14:11.451
No--no,
this doesn't make any sense.

14:11.484 --> 14:14.021
I was disoriented;
I was frozen.

14:14.054 --> 14:17.157
- Right, well, it is possible
that that's just the way

14:17.190 --> 14:19.559
that your body reacted
to the trauma.

14:19.592 --> 14:21.161
- What do you mean?

14:21.194 --> 14:22.629
- Well, there's something called
tonic immobility.

14:22.662 --> 14:24.898
And sometimes,
when you're under attack,

14:24.932 --> 14:26.433
or being assaulted,

14:26.466 --> 14:29.236
your brain can send
a message to your body

14:29.269 --> 14:31.905
that tells it to shut down,
to--to freeze,

14:31.939 --> 14:34.607
and it--it happens in a flash.
It's automatic,

14:34.641 --> 14:38.111
and it's beyond
conscious control.

14:38.145 --> 14:39.913
- No, I get it, but--

14:39.947 --> 14:43.984
no, I felt that way
before he assaulted me.

14:44.017 --> 14:48.521
- Now you said that you went
into the meditation room...

14:48.555 --> 14:50.190
- He came in;

14:50.223 --> 14:52.192
he gave me a glass of water;

14:52.225 --> 14:56.563
I drank it;
and then he told me to relax.

14:56.596 --> 14:59.066
- Okay.
- He said he wanted to take me

14:59.099 --> 15:01.668
to the sixth plane
of enlightenment.

15:01.701 --> 15:03.603
- And then what happened?

15:03.636 --> 15:05.538
- He kept saying that
"When you look at me,

15:05.572 --> 15:08.942
you might find yourself
enveloped by a warm feeling."

15:10.243 --> 15:13.613
And the next thing I knew,
I--I felt so weird.

15:13.646 --> 15:17.184
It was like I was there,
but I wasn't.

15:17.217 --> 15:20.520
And...
- It's okay.

15:20.553 --> 15:23.623
It's okay.
Just keep going.

15:23.656 --> 15:26.159
- And he just kept whispering...

15:28.228 --> 15:32.199
"You look like
a beautiful ragdoll."

15:32.232 --> 15:34.334
And that's how I felt.

15:34.367 --> 15:37.637
Totally powerless.

15:37.670 --> 15:42.109
I had no control over my body.

15:42.142 --> 15:46.113
I've never felt
that way before, ever.

15:48.681 --> 15:50.117
- The tox screen was negative,

15:50.150 --> 15:51.718
but she still feels like
she was drugged?

15:51.751 --> 15:53.120
- Well, we all know Rohypnol
can leave your system

15:53.153 --> 15:54.354
within a matter of hours.

15:54.387 --> 15:55.722
I mean, a--a vic urinates,
it's gone.

15:55.755 --> 15:57.324
- Well, that's certainly
possible,

15:57.357 --> 16:00.093
but she seems to remember
exactly what happened.

16:00.127 --> 16:02.195
- I don't know.
She was affected by something.

16:02.229 --> 16:03.730
- Is she on
any kind of medication?

16:03.763 --> 16:05.132
Does she show signs
of mental illness?

16:05.165 --> 16:07.167
- It doesn't appear that way.

16:07.200 --> 16:10.337
I mean, she seems like a high-
functioning young woman to me.

16:10.370 --> 16:12.139
- Is it possible
she has another agenda?

16:12.172 --> 16:14.574
Trask is rich.
- I don't see that either.

16:14.607 --> 16:16.743
I mean,
she is a successful publicist,

16:16.776 --> 16:18.778
and her boyfriend is
a partner in a law firm.

16:18.811 --> 16:21.614
- We need more evidence.
- Like a previous victim?

16:21.648 --> 16:23.083
I've been digging into Trask,

16:23.116 --> 16:25.118
and I found a civil case
filed in 2014.

16:25.152 --> 16:27.387
A woman named Rachel Sykes
accused him of rape.

16:27.420 --> 16:29.356
- In New York?
- No, in Paramus, New Jersey,

16:29.389 --> 16:32.159
but the case was dropped.
- Rachel Sykes willing to talk?

16:32.192 --> 16:33.760
- That's unclear.
Can't really find her.

16:33.793 --> 16:35.562
Last known address
was a dead end.

16:35.595 --> 16:37.297
Last place of employment--
they couldn't help either.

16:37.330 --> 16:39.766
- Okay, so keep looking.
I mean, talk to the lawyer,

16:39.799 --> 16:42.102
and let's see
what we can find out.

16:42.135 --> 16:43.770
[dramatic music]

16:43.803 --> 16:45.572
- Rachel Sykes, good woman.

16:45.605 --> 16:47.740
Had a solid case
against that clown Trask, too.

16:47.774 --> 16:49.609
- Did she go to the police?
- She went to Jersey PD.

16:49.642 --> 16:51.144
Got a rape kit, the whole deal.

16:51.178 --> 16:52.645
- Okay, why didn't they go
forward with it?

16:52.679 --> 16:53.646
- She told the cops
he roofied her.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.315
She was adamant.

16:55.348 --> 16:57.050
- And let me guess,
her tox screen came back normal?

16:57.084 --> 16:59.686
- How did you know?

16:59.719 --> 17:01.421
- So what happened
with the lawsuit?

17:01.454 --> 17:03.156
- Rachel got tired
of fighting Trask.

17:03.190 --> 17:04.657
She spiraled,
fell into a depression,

17:04.691 --> 17:06.326
quit her job,
moved back to Ohio,

17:06.359 --> 17:08.595
and then...
- What happened?

17:08.628 --> 17:10.230
- Pancreatic cancer.

17:10.263 --> 17:12.765
Diagnosis three months later.
Lights out.

17:12.799 --> 17:14.401
- That's awful.
I'm sorry.

17:14.434 --> 17:16.169
- So I'm guessing you're here,

17:16.203 --> 17:17.704
because Trask did it again,
am I right?

17:17.737 --> 17:19.639
- Well, let's just say
it's not a coincidence.

17:19.672 --> 17:21.674
- Right, well, I'll shut up,

17:21.708 --> 17:23.643
and let Rachel tell you
what happened.

17:25.145 --> 17:27.614
- It was after one of his talks.

17:27.647 --> 17:30.717
He had invited some people
up to his hotel suite.

17:30.750 --> 17:33.320
Next thing you know,
I'm alone with him.

17:33.353 --> 17:37.190
He said he wanted to show me a--
a new meditation technique.

17:37.224 --> 17:39.192
- Did he make you a drink?

17:39.226 --> 17:42.295
- No, I didn't wanna drink
any of his special tea,

17:42.329 --> 17:44.631
so he gave me a water.

17:44.664 --> 17:49.802
I drank it, and I started
feeling really disoriented.

17:49.836 --> 17:51.471
- Then what happened?

17:51.504 --> 17:53.340
- He was massaging my temples,

17:53.373 --> 17:56.476
telling me to relax.

17:56.509 --> 17:58.345
He said he wanted to take me

17:58.378 --> 18:01.114
to the sixth plane
of enlightenment.

18:01.148 --> 18:03.116
The more he kept talking,

18:03.150 --> 18:05.452
the more I felt myself
drifting away,

18:05.485 --> 18:07.887
and it felt good.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.757
I remember he kept whispering,

18:10.790 --> 18:14.694
"You're a beautiful ragdoll."
- Even ragdoll.

18:14.727 --> 18:16.763
- Okay, we've heard
all this before.

18:16.796 --> 18:18.365
- What happened next?
- He--

18:18.398 --> 18:21.134
he picked up my arm,
and dropped it.

18:21.168 --> 18:23.236
I was limp.
I had no control.

18:23.270 --> 18:28.241
Then he pushed up my skirt,
and he raped me.

18:28.275 --> 18:30.743
I wanted him to stop,
but I felt so out of it.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.345
[sobs]

18:32.379 --> 18:34.281
I was helpless.

18:34.314 --> 18:36.416
- Let's take a break.

18:36.449 --> 18:38.751
- Okay, this is
horrifyingly familiar.

18:38.785 --> 18:40.353
- And she was tested for
drugs and alcohol.

18:40.387 --> 18:42.222
She was totally clean,
just like Abby.

18:42.255 --> 18:44.924
- Maybe he put something
undetectable in the water.

18:44.957 --> 18:48.861
- I think he slipped something
undetectable in his words.

18:50.763 --> 18:53.766
Neuro-linguistic programming.
- Neuro-linguistic what?

18:53.800 --> 18:57.904
- Are you suggesting
that she was hypnotized?

19:08.581 --> 19:08.781
.

19:08.815 --> 19:09.216
- It seems possible.

19:11.418 --> 19:12.819
I mean, the victims' stories
are basically the same.

19:12.852 --> 19:14.387
The way he talked to him,
massaging their temples.

19:14.421 --> 19:15.588
I mean, the elements
are all there.

19:15.622 --> 19:17.257
- Well, hold on,
isn't hypnotism,

19:17.290 --> 19:18.491
like, a carnival trick, though?

19:18.525 --> 19:20.260
This seems out there to me.

19:20.293 --> 19:22.429
- Uh, my cousin quit smoking
with hypnotherapy.

19:22.462 --> 19:24.331
He was a pack-a-day guy.

19:24.364 --> 19:26.699
One session with a hypnotist--
bang--he was clean.

19:26.733 --> 19:28.768
- In Brooklyn,
I had a hypnosis case.

19:28.801 --> 19:30.770
One of my first
sexual assault trials--lost--

19:30.803 --> 19:32.739
broke the record
for fastest felony acquittal.

19:32.772 --> 19:34.674
We made a strong case,
but the judge never bought in.

19:34.707 --> 19:36.809
- And if the judge doesn't buy
it, then the jury does the math.

19:36.843 --> 19:38.611
- Trust me.

19:38.645 --> 19:40.680
I know this sounds crazy,
but I've seen this.

19:40.713 --> 19:43.383
Trask used common
hypnotherapeutic methods

19:43.416 --> 19:44.884
on both those women.

19:46.453 --> 19:48.321
How do we prove it?
- We can't use Rachel Sykes.

19:48.355 --> 19:49.522
That criminal case
was never filed.

19:49.556 --> 19:50.890
The civil suit was dismissed.

19:50.923 --> 19:52.792
- There's no way
a judge allows that in.

19:52.825 --> 19:54.561
- Well, hold on, so we get into
this case another way.

19:54.594 --> 19:55.828
- First, we have to
prove that Trask

19:55.862 --> 19:58.565
knowingly used hypnosis
to rape Abby.

19:58.598 --> 20:00.333
- Which means we need evidence

20:00.367 --> 20:01.768
that Trask even knows
how to hypnotize.

20:01.801 --> 20:03.270
- Well, he must've learned
how to do it somewhere.

20:03.303 --> 20:04.804
- Yeah, so start digging.

20:06.473 --> 20:08.441
[dramatic music]

20:08.475 --> 20:10.877
- Class dismissed.
- Excuse me, Professor.

20:10.910 --> 20:13.413
I'm Detective Carisi.
This is Detective Rollins.

20:13.446 --> 20:15.815
Do you remember a student
of yours named Declan Trask?

20:15.848 --> 20:18.551
- Actually,
I remember Declan Trask well.

20:18.585 --> 20:20.753
- He stood out?
- His father did.

20:20.787 --> 20:22.889
Gave lots of money.
- According to his website,

20:22.922 --> 20:25.358
he graduated here
with a degree in Communications.

20:25.392 --> 20:27.327
- Yeah, we'd like to
see those transcripts.

20:27.360 --> 20:29.829
- You're welcome to take a look,
but, uh, it's a quick read.

20:29.862 --> 20:33.366
Declan Trask was kicked out
his junior year.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.702
- For what?
- I can't discuss that.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.704
- Oh, we're prepared
to get a warrant

20:37.737 --> 20:39.439
for any transcripts or records
we might need to build our case.

20:39.472 --> 20:41.341
- Yeah, or you could
just save us some time,

20:41.374 --> 20:43.476
and help us bury
a sexual predator.

20:44.877 --> 20:47.847
- Declan had
a serious drug problem.

20:47.880 --> 20:49.849
We did everything we could
to support him,

20:49.882 --> 20:52.752
but we had no choice
but to expel him.

20:54.454 --> 20:56.689
- Where'd he go
after you gave him the boot?

20:56.723 --> 20:58.825
- An addiction facility
in the Hamptons

20:58.858 --> 21:02.495
called, uh, The Springs.

21:02.529 --> 21:03.930
- Hm.

21:03.963 --> 21:05.665
- I spoke to Declan
two weeks ago.

21:05.698 --> 21:07.567
- You stayed in touch?
- We did.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.736
The bonds that form here
can be pretty strong.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.704
Addicts often rely on
each other,

21:11.738 --> 21:13.973
even after we're sober.
- What kinda techniques

21:14.006 --> 21:15.875
did you use to help him
kick his habit?

21:15.908 --> 21:19.379
- Without being too specific,
uh, I used hypnosis.

21:19.412 --> 21:22.715
- How long did you see him for?
- We were together for 60 days.

21:22.749 --> 21:25.352
By the end,
if he even thought about heroin,

21:25.385 --> 21:27.987
he'd physically gag.

21:28.020 --> 21:31.491
So, uh, what is this about?

21:31.524 --> 21:33.493
- Well, we think he may be
using hypnosis techniques

21:33.526 --> 21:35.762
to--to sexually assault women.

21:38.798 --> 21:40.600
- You don't seem surprised.

21:40.633 --> 21:42.969
- Look, Declan and I have
a close relationship,

21:43.002 --> 21:44.637
but I know who he is.

21:44.671 --> 21:46.406
And frankly,
what he's doing now--

21:46.439 --> 21:47.707
handing out Ayahuasca--

21:47.740 --> 21:49.542
he's just another dealer
peddling drugs.

21:49.576 --> 21:50.977
Never sat well with me.

21:51.010 --> 21:53.846
- Did you teach Trask
how to hypnotize people?

21:53.880 --> 21:56.416
- Yeah, he said he wanted to
help others, to pay it forward,

21:56.449 --> 21:57.884
so I taught him
everything I know.

21:57.917 --> 22:00.953
- Huh, well,
are you willing to help us now?

22:03.623 --> 22:05.458
- Listen, I understand
he's your friend,

22:05.492 --> 22:07.794
but the guy is
a sexual predator.

22:07.827 --> 22:09.696
He needs to be stopped.

22:14.834 --> 22:17.437
- I don't know what to do,
where to turn.

22:17.470 --> 22:19.506
It's a nightmare.

22:19.539 --> 22:21.608
- What's going on?

22:21.641 --> 22:22.942
- I can trust you,
right, Declan?

22:22.975 --> 22:25.412
- [sighs]
You saved my life, man.

22:25.445 --> 22:27.947
Yeah, whatever it is,
it stays between us.

22:29.682 --> 22:31.651
- I was with a patient
a few days ago.

22:31.684 --> 22:32.985
Attractive woman.

22:33.019 --> 22:35.622
Suffers from a destructive
opioid addiction.

22:35.655 --> 22:38.758
- Are you using hypnotherapy?
- Yeah, a lot of basic sessions

22:38.791 --> 22:42.061
on changing
her subconscious patterns.

22:42.094 --> 22:45.432
She's in my office

22:45.465 --> 22:47.867
on the couch
in a complete trance state,

22:47.900 --> 22:50.970
and the conversation
becomes very sexualized.

22:52.071 --> 22:54.541
And I couldn't stop myself.

22:54.574 --> 22:57.477
I--I sat down next to her,
and I--

22:58.911 --> 23:00.813
- You crossed the line?

23:00.847 --> 23:02.582
- I kissed her.

23:02.615 --> 23:06.586
Then, thank God,
I stopped myself, but...

23:06.619 --> 23:08.721
I didn't want to.

23:08.755 --> 23:10.857
- Hypnosis doesn't make people
do something

23:10.890 --> 23:12.892
they don't already wanna do,

23:12.925 --> 23:16.062
so if she kissed you,
she wanted to.

23:16.095 --> 23:18.765
- Sounds like
he's rationalizing.

23:18.798 --> 23:20.733
- Can't rationalize rape.

23:20.767 --> 23:22.569
- I feel horrible about it.

23:22.602 --> 23:24.504
- Ah, don't beat yourself up.

23:24.537 --> 23:26.606
- I took advantage
of this woman.

23:26.639 --> 23:28.575
- It's--it's not taking
advantage of them.

23:28.608 --> 23:30.677
Hypnosis--

23:30.710 --> 23:32.879
sometimes, it leads to sex.
It happens.

23:32.912 --> 23:34.481
- Come on, Declan,
are you saying

23:34.514 --> 23:36.583
that you've used hypnosis
to have sex?

23:38.651 --> 23:40.887
- Look, it's not a big deal.

23:40.920 --> 23:43.923
I'm just helping a woman get
what she really wants.

23:46.659 --> 23:48.961
- When's the last time
you did this?

23:57.103 --> 23:59.672
- Uh...

23:59.706 --> 24:04.544
[chuckles]
You know, I, uh--

24:04.577 --> 24:05.812
[exhales sharply]
It's good to see you, buddy,

24:05.845 --> 24:07.647
but I, uh--I gotta run.

24:11.684 --> 24:13.786
- NYPD.
- What's going on?

24:13.820 --> 24:17.056
- Look deep into my eyes.
You're under arrest.

24:24.664 --> 24:25.031
.

24:25.064 --> 24:25.565
- With all due respect,

24:27.199 --> 24:29.101
I think you guys
have got this wrong.

24:29.135 --> 24:30.169
- So enlighten us.
Tell us what we're missing.

24:30.202 --> 24:31.504
- I'm a healer, okay?

24:31.538 --> 24:33.105
My work is intimate by nature,

24:33.139 --> 24:34.507
and sometimes that intimacy
leads to sex.

24:34.541 --> 24:36.242
Consensual sex.
That's it.

24:36.275 --> 24:38.511
- Then if it was so consensual
and so simple,

24:38.545 --> 24:40.046
why did she come down
to the precinct

24:40.079 --> 24:41.648
and tell us you raped her?
- Great question.

24:41.681 --> 24:43.516
I wish I knew the answer.

24:43.550 --> 24:45.117
Look, I don't know,
maybe she had a change of heart,

24:45.151 --> 24:47.286
or her boyfriend found out.
I don't know.

24:47.319 --> 24:49.722
- So you didn't hypnotize Abby?

24:49.756 --> 24:52.659
Put her into some sort
of a trance?

24:52.692 --> 24:55.695
Incapacitate her in some way,
and then--and then assault her?

24:55.728 --> 24:58.097
- I'm flattered you think
my words wield so much power,

24:58.130 --> 24:59.699
but, you know, that's absurd.

24:59.732 --> 25:01.300
- Well,
it didn't sound so absurd

25:01.333 --> 25:02.735
when you were talking to
your friend Jack Roe.

25:02.769 --> 25:05.071
- See, 'cause we have you
on tape

25:05.104 --> 25:08.741
saying, "Hypnosis
can lead to sex.

25:08.775 --> 25:10.677
"It's not a big deal.

25:10.710 --> 25:13.613
I'm just helping a woman get
what she really wants."

25:13.646 --> 25:15.047
- Uh, I wasn't speaking about
myself personally.

25:15.081 --> 25:16.549
I was trying to
reassure a friend.

25:16.583 --> 25:18.117
- What about Rachel Sykes?

25:18.150 --> 25:21.220
Were you just trying to
reassure her too?

25:21.253 --> 25:23.089
- [sighs]

25:23.122 --> 25:24.757
I think it's best
if I talk to my attorney.

25:24.791 --> 25:26.659
- If you lawyer up,
I can pretty much tell you

25:26.693 --> 25:28.160
this is going to trial.

25:28.194 --> 25:29.328
- Do you really think
a jury's gonna believe

25:29.361 --> 25:31.130
that I--that me, Declan Trask,

25:31.163 --> 25:33.966
hypnotized Abby to--to what,
to have sex with her?

25:34.000 --> 25:36.569
- Well, A,
what you did wasn't sex.

25:36.603 --> 25:39.572
That's called rape.
And B, yes,

25:39.606 --> 25:42.609
I really think that
the jury will believe it.

25:42.642 --> 25:47.747
So Fin, can you please escort
Mr. Declan Trask to Rikers?

25:51.751 --> 25:53.720
[dramatic music]

25:53.753 --> 25:55.354
- On the night of April 10th,

25:55.387 --> 25:57.289
the defendant
sexually assaulted Abby Clarke.

25:57.323 --> 26:01.160
He did not hold Ms. Clarke down.
He did not strike her.

26:01.193 --> 26:03.730
He did not incapacitate her
with drugs or alcohol.

26:03.763 --> 26:05.364
He incapacitated her
with his words.

26:05.397 --> 26:06.833
He hypnotized her...

26:08.635 --> 26:10.269
Rendering her powerless,
incapable of consent,

26:10.302 --> 26:13.105
and then he raped her.

26:13.139 --> 26:15.207
The defendant presents himself
as a healer.

26:15.241 --> 26:19.045
The evidence will reveal
that he is in fact a predator.

26:21.781 --> 26:23.650
- Good afternoon.

26:23.683 --> 26:27.654
Mr. Barba's version of events
is frankly preposterous.

26:27.687 --> 26:31.290
Declan Trask is a handsome,
charming, single man.

26:31.323 --> 26:34.226
There was a mutual attraction
between he and Ms. Clarke.

26:34.260 --> 26:36.195
They had sex that night.

26:36.228 --> 26:39.632
The idea that
Declan used hypnosis

26:39.666 --> 26:42.268
as a vehicle
to render Ms. Clarke

26:42.301 --> 26:44.270
incapable of consent?

26:44.303 --> 26:46.773
It's absurd.

26:46.806 --> 26:50.643
His words may be soothing,
tantalizing,

26:50.677 --> 26:52.311
even seductive,

26:52.344 --> 26:54.814
but they can't make
someone do something

26:54.847 --> 26:58.084
they do not want to do.

26:58.117 --> 27:01.654
I implore you,
use your common sense,

27:01.688 --> 27:04.323
and find him not guilty.

27:08.094 --> 27:12.064
- When you stepped into the
meditation room around 11:55,

27:12.098 --> 27:14.366
was anyone in there?
- No, it was empty.

27:14.400 --> 27:16.903
What was your mental state?
- It was fine.

27:16.936 --> 27:19.438
Happy, actually.

27:19.471 --> 27:21.407
I was enjoying the retreat.

27:21.440 --> 27:23.810
I just didn't wanna take
the Ayahuasca,

27:23.843 --> 27:27.814
and so I went in there to think,

27:27.847 --> 27:30.850
to meditate.

27:30.883 --> 27:33.786
Then Declan,
the defendant, walked in.

27:33.820 --> 27:35.354
- What happened next?

27:35.387 --> 27:38.090
- He gave me a glass of water,

27:38.124 --> 27:40.192
and we started talking.

27:40.226 --> 27:44.430
He kept saying, "You might
find yourself at peace.

27:44.463 --> 27:48.801
"You may find yourself
soothed by my voice.

27:48.835 --> 27:50.770
"Can you imagine
how good you'll feel

27:50.803 --> 27:52.905
while you listen to me?"

27:52.939 --> 27:56.909
And after awhile,
I'd, um, became disoriented.

27:56.943 --> 27:58.477
- What does that mean?

27:58.510 --> 28:03.149
- It felt like I was in a dream.
I--I had no, uh,

28:03.182 --> 28:07.153
control over my body.
- Mm-hmm.

28:07.186 --> 28:10.256
- And then--

28:10.289 --> 28:14.293
and then he started, uh--

28:14.326 --> 28:16.495
pulled off my pants,

28:16.528 --> 28:20.767
and put his--
he started having sex with me.

28:22.401 --> 28:24.503
I was terrified.
I--I--

28:24.536 --> 28:27.173
- Thank you.
Nothing further.

28:30.276 --> 28:32.879
- Ms. Clarke,
you went to Mr. Trask's retreat

28:32.912 --> 28:36.783
fully intending on having sex
with someone else, did you not?

28:36.816 --> 28:38.484
- No--what--that's not true.

28:38.517 --> 28:42.288
- Your Honor, I'd like to enter
defense Exhibit G,

28:42.321 --> 28:44.824
the application
Ms. Clarke submitted

28:44.857 --> 28:46.492
to attend Mr. Trask's retreat.

28:46.525 --> 28:49.428
If you could read
from the top of the page.

28:49.461 --> 28:51.397
- I'm sorry.
I--I can't do this.

28:51.430 --> 28:55.501
- It's just one paragraph,
Ms. Clarke, and you wrote it.

28:55.534 --> 28:57.403
- No, I--I won't.
Please.

28:57.436 --> 28:59.371
- I apologize, Your Honor.
If we could take a short recess.

28:59.405 --> 29:00.907
Ms. Clarke just--
she needs a moment.

29:00.940 --> 29:02.308
- She doesn't get a moment
during my cross.

29:02.341 --> 29:05.211
- Your Honor?
Please.

29:05.244 --> 29:06.846
- You have 15 minutes.

29:06.879 --> 29:08.447
Obviously, Mr. Barba,

29:08.480 --> 29:10.316
you are not allowed
to converse with her

29:10.349 --> 29:12.018
during this recess.

29:17.890 --> 29:19.959
- Hey, what's going on?
Are you okay?

29:19.992 --> 29:21.928
- Uh, it's--
it's just really hard.

29:21.961 --> 29:23.529
- Hey, you mind coming with me
for just a second?

29:23.562 --> 29:25.464
- Here, Abby.

29:25.497 --> 29:27.867
- Now Trask's lawyer wants to
publically humiliate me?

29:27.900 --> 29:30.803
After all this?
After what he did to me?

29:30.837 --> 29:32.504
That's not right.
That's not fair.

29:32.538 --> 29:34.340
- That's not fair, but look,

29:34.373 --> 29:35.975
I know that this
threw you off guard,

29:36.008 --> 29:38.510
but the fact is we went through
all of this in prep,

29:38.544 --> 29:40.012
so you just gotta
trust the prep.

29:40.046 --> 29:41.881
You are ready.
- I know, but I--

29:41.914 --> 29:43.215
- Did you--
did you talk to Steven?

29:43.249 --> 29:44.550
Did you give him a heads up?

29:44.583 --> 29:48.287
- No, I tried three times.

29:48.320 --> 29:49.588
I can't get back up
on that stand

29:49.621 --> 29:51.958
and read that letter aloud.

29:51.991 --> 29:53.826
It'll destroy him.
[whimpers]

29:53.860 --> 29:56.395
It will destroy us.

29:58.564 --> 30:01.433
I love him.

30:01.467 --> 30:04.937
He stood by me through all this.

30:04.971 --> 30:07.339
I just wanna be done.

30:07.373 --> 30:10.609
- I know you do.

30:10.642 --> 30:14.046
I understand.
This is an extremely painful

30:14.080 --> 30:16.548
and difficult process.

30:16.582 --> 30:18.450
But I just need you to know

30:18.484 --> 30:20.586
that if you do choose
not to get up on the stand,

30:20.619 --> 30:24.490
that--that Declan Trask
will walk free.

30:27.359 --> 30:30.462
- Steven will never forgive me.

30:30.496 --> 30:33.099
- Mm, the question is
will you forgive yourself

30:33.132 --> 30:36.568
if you--if you give up now?

30:38.938 --> 30:42.408
They are shaming you
into giving up.

30:42.441 --> 30:45.945
You didn't do
anything wrong, Abby.

30:52.952 --> 30:55.554
- If you could start
from the top of the page.

30:55.587 --> 30:59.558
- "Ever since I was
a little girl in Alden, Iowa,

30:59.591 --> 31:01.127
"I've been on a constant mission

31:01.160 --> 31:03.595
"to be the best version
of myself,

31:03.629 --> 31:05.998
"to create the perfect life

31:06.032 --> 31:08.434
"with all its perfect trimmings.

31:08.467 --> 31:12.371
"I feel like I'm so close to
achieving my dream.

31:12.404 --> 31:15.341
"The one thing
that's holding me back

31:15.374 --> 31:20.046
"is my relationship
with my boyfriend, Steven.

31:20.079 --> 31:22.414
"I long to move forward;

31:22.448 --> 31:25.084
"he longs to stay the same.

31:25.117 --> 31:27.553
"I wanna explore.

31:27.586 --> 31:31.357
"Instead of being lovers,
we're roommates.

31:31.390 --> 31:33.625
I feel trapped."

31:36.028 --> 31:38.364
- Please continue.

31:44.370 --> 31:46.038
- "I'm not sure
that we connect anymore

31:46.072 --> 31:49.175
"intellectually, spiritually,

31:49.208 --> 31:51.143
or sexually."

31:51.177 --> 31:54.646
- These are your words.
- Yes.

31:54.680 --> 31:56.648
When I wrote them,
I was confused.

31:56.682 --> 31:59.485
We had been fighting.
I was having doubts.

31:59.518 --> 32:01.988
But I love him,
and I would never cheat on him.

32:02.021 --> 32:04.090
- But you were in a rut,
looking to explore.

32:04.123 --> 32:05.524
- Yes, that's true,
but this is--

32:05.557 --> 32:07.393
- It's also true
that you had sex

32:07.426 --> 32:08.627
with another man
at that retreat.

32:08.660 --> 32:10.529
- Objection.
- Sustained.

32:12.999 --> 32:15.167
- Steven, no, please, wait!

32:15.201 --> 32:16.535
Steven...

32:18.770 --> 32:20.506
- Nothing further.

32:20.539 --> 32:22.541
- Given the late hour,
court's adjourned.

32:22.574 --> 32:25.477
We'll pick it up
tomorrow morning, 9:00 a.m.

32:25.511 --> 32:28.080
- Your Honor,
can we meet in chambers?

32:28.114 --> 32:31.150
A new piece of evidence
has come to light.

32:33.085 --> 32:35.587
I'd like to enter
a cell phone audio recording

32:35.621 --> 32:38.124
of the encounter between
Mr. Trask and Ms. Clarke.

32:38.157 --> 32:39.658
- What?

32:39.691 --> 32:41.693
- Mr. Trask often records
intimate encounters

32:41.727 --> 32:43.662
to protect himself
from this very type of

32:43.695 --> 32:45.464
fraudulent accusation.

32:45.497 --> 32:46.665
- And you just discovered
this purported recording?

32:46.698 --> 32:48.400
Please.

32:48.434 --> 32:49.535
Your Honor,
she's trying to sandbag us.

32:49.568 --> 32:51.403
- Settle down, Mr. Barba.

32:51.437 --> 32:53.439
Let's hear the recording.

32:55.041 --> 32:56.642
- I'm gonna lay down
next to you.

32:56.675 --> 32:58.744
You're good with that, right?
- Yes.

32:58.777 --> 33:00.779
- And when I lay down,

33:00.812 --> 33:03.682
you'll be ready to go to the
sixth plane with me, won't you?

33:03.715 --> 33:05.517
- I will.

33:05.551 --> 33:07.553
- I'm gonna do it now.

33:07.586 --> 33:09.555
You want me
to have sex with you?

33:09.588 --> 33:11.790
- Yes, I do.

33:11.823 --> 33:14.560
- A hypnotized woman
says yes to having sex.

33:14.593 --> 33:16.262
Means nothing.
- To you.

33:25.504 --> 33:26.072
.

33:26.105 --> 33:27.005
- Hey, just because the judge
ruled in my favor

33:28.607 --> 33:30.142
doesn't mean I'm adverse
to making a deal.

33:30.176 --> 33:32.078
- A deal?
- Sexual misconduct.

33:32.111 --> 33:33.479
- [scoffs] A misdemeanor?
This is a class D felony.

33:33.512 --> 33:35.347
Sexual abuse, first degree.

33:35.381 --> 33:37.349
He admits to the hypnosis,
and he goes on the registry.

33:37.383 --> 33:40.419
- Assault 2, no registry.

33:43.389 --> 33:45.091
- You're considering her offer?

33:45.124 --> 33:47.293
- The facts in this case
are less than ideal.

33:47.326 --> 33:49.228
- No registry?
You cannot be serious.

33:49.261 --> 33:51.830
- I can be pragmatic.
- Okay.

33:51.863 --> 33:53.165
Well, have you talked to Abby?

33:53.199 --> 33:54.500
- Yes.
- And?

33:54.533 --> 33:56.302
- She wants to
let the jury decide.

33:56.335 --> 33:58.070
- Well, there you go.
- It's not up to her.

33:58.104 --> 33:59.338
- Based on
what she's been through.

33:59.371 --> 34:01.140
I'm pretty sure I disagree.

34:01.173 --> 34:02.508
- Based on
what she's been through,

34:02.541 --> 34:04.276
I'm pretty sure
I don't wanna lose.

34:04.310 --> 34:07.079
- So let's flip the script.
Let's lean into this.

34:07.113 --> 34:09.315
Let's keep digging.
- And this means the jury

34:09.348 --> 34:12.118
will hear that recording
of Abby saying yes.

34:12.151 --> 34:16.855
- All we need to do is prove
that Trask hypnotized Abby,

34:16.888 --> 34:20.826
and that "yes"
will mean nothing.

34:23.162 --> 34:25.131
[dramatic music]

34:25.164 --> 34:26.565
- I'm gonna lay down
next to you.

34:26.598 --> 34:29.535
You're good with that, right?
- Yes.

34:29.568 --> 34:31.537
- And when I lay down,

34:31.570 --> 34:34.340
you'll be ready to go to the
sixth plane with me, won't you?

34:34.373 --> 34:36.108
- I will.

34:36.142 --> 34:38.144
- I'm gonna do it now.

34:38.177 --> 34:40.146
You want me
to have sex with you?

34:40.179 --> 34:41.480
- Yes.

34:41.513 --> 34:43.415
- That's where
the recording ends.

34:43.449 --> 34:47.419
That was your voice
on the audio file, Ms. Clarke.

34:47.453 --> 34:49.621
- It was, but I--

34:49.655 --> 34:51.423
- And you were saying
yes to sex.

34:51.457 --> 34:53.259
That correct?
- I don't know.

34:53.292 --> 34:54.426
I--I don't remember
saying any of that.

34:54.460 --> 34:56.162
- I'm not asking
if you remember,

34:56.195 --> 34:59.165
I'm asking if that was
your voice on that tape

34:59.198 --> 35:01.333
saying yes to sex.

35:03.702 --> 35:07.873
- I--I suppose it was.

35:07.906 --> 35:09.508
- Nothing further.

35:16.348 --> 35:18.317
- That was brutal.

35:18.350 --> 35:20.552
So much for flipping the script.

35:20.586 --> 35:22.454
Do we have
anything else on Trask?

35:22.488 --> 35:24.423
- We're still digging.
- We're running out of time.

35:24.456 --> 35:25.857
- Please tell me
that you found something.

35:25.891 --> 35:27.459
- Yeah--yeah, something good.

35:27.493 --> 35:28.927
Now it happened
18 years ago in Philly;

35:28.960 --> 35:30.662
it's got nothing to do
with rape;

35:30.696 --> 35:32.264
but it does go directly to
the heart of this case,

35:32.298 --> 35:34.600
Trask's credibility.

35:34.633 --> 35:37.269
- Proves he's a selfish coward.
That's for sure.

35:37.303 --> 35:38.504
- Is the arresting officer
on board?

35:38.537 --> 35:40.172
- Ready and willing.

35:40.206 --> 35:41.607
- Do you think
you could get this in?

35:41.640 --> 35:43.875
- If Trask takes the stand,
I'll find a way.

35:43.909 --> 35:45.344
- He will.

35:45.377 --> 35:47.379
He thinks he can hypnotize
the jury.

35:49.481 --> 35:51.350
- Mr. Trask,
could you tell the jury

35:51.383 --> 35:53.519
the purpose of
the retreats you host?

35:53.552 --> 35:55.287
- Uh,
when you really break it down,

35:55.321 --> 35:57.289
it's a weekend
where I try to help people

35:57.323 --> 36:00.592
maximize their potential.
- And at the time in question,

36:00.626 --> 36:02.228
when you were alone
with Ms. Clarke,

36:02.261 --> 36:04.396
was she tense or upset?

36:04.430 --> 36:06.465
- Both.
That's why I tried to relax her.

36:06.498 --> 36:07.933
- How did you do that?

36:07.966 --> 36:09.268
- With some simple
meditation techniques,

36:09.301 --> 36:10.369
nothing fancy.

36:10.402 --> 36:12.371
- And this led to sex?

36:12.404 --> 36:13.539
- Yes.

36:13.572 --> 36:14.940
Abby's a bright,
beautiful woman,

36:14.973 --> 36:16.642
and we connected.

36:16.675 --> 36:18.677
- Did you ask
Ms. Clarke's consent

36:18.710 --> 36:20.679
before having sex?
- I did.

36:20.712 --> 36:23.415
- And what did she say?
- She said yes.

36:23.449 --> 36:25.651
- Like we heard on the tape.

36:25.684 --> 36:29.655
Silly as this might sound,
I have to ask.

36:29.688 --> 36:32.524
Did you hypnotize her
at any point?

36:32.558 --> 36:34.526
- Of course not.
- Thank you.

36:34.560 --> 36:37.263
Nothing further.

36:37.296 --> 36:40.266
- You help broken people
become whole with your retreats?

36:40.299 --> 36:43.602
- Yes, and sometimes I help
whole people become more whole.

36:43.635 --> 36:45.937
- People pay you for this?
- Yes.

36:45.971 --> 36:47.439
- But you don't keep
all of the money.

36:47.473 --> 36:50.276
You give some of it
to your foundation.

36:50.309 --> 36:51.743
- That's right.
- What does your foundation do?

36:51.777 --> 36:53.479
- They provide safe
drinking water

36:53.512 --> 36:55.514
to the poor
and impoverished nations.

36:55.547 --> 36:58.317
- You save lives?
- I do, and I'm proud of it.

36:58.350 --> 36:59.618
- As you should be.

36:59.651 --> 37:01.553
Have you ever been
arrested for a crime?

37:01.587 --> 37:03.589
- Never.
- Nothing further.

37:04.990 --> 37:06.492
Your Honor, I'd like to call
a rebuttal witness,

37:06.525 --> 37:08.026
Philadelphia Lieutenant
Richard Hill.

37:08.059 --> 37:09.995
- Objection.
May I approach?

37:12.764 --> 37:14.633
- Where are you going,
Mr. Barba?

37:14.666 --> 37:17.035
- Uh, Lieutenant Hill arrested
the defendant 22 years ago.

37:17.068 --> 37:19.438
- What the hell does that
have to do with this case?

37:19.471 --> 37:21.507
- Everything.
It proves he's a liar,

37:21.540 --> 37:24.610
and that he has no regard for
anyone but himself.

37:26.612 --> 37:29.481
Thank you for coming,
Lieutenant Hill.

37:29.515 --> 37:33.452
Where were you on the night of
June 8th, 1995?

37:33.485 --> 37:35.721
- I was outside a residence
on 850 Pine Street,

37:35.754 --> 37:37.689
investigating a car accident.

37:37.723 --> 37:39.391
The driver had
pulled out of a driveway,

37:39.425 --> 37:40.759
and slammed into a street light.

37:40.792 --> 37:43.061
- And who was driving?
- Declan Trask.

37:43.094 --> 37:44.730
- Do you see Mr. Trask
here in this courtroom?

37:44.763 --> 37:47.333
- I do.
The defendant.

37:47.366 --> 37:48.734
- And when you searched
Mr. Trask's car,

37:48.767 --> 37:50.469
what'd you find?
- I found pills

37:50.502 --> 37:52.738
and a gram of heroin
in the glove department.

37:52.771 --> 37:54.606
- Did you arrest Mr. Trask
for possession of drugs?

37:54.640 --> 37:56.475
- Objection.
That arrest was expunged.

37:56.508 --> 37:59.545
- I'm introducing the arrest
for impeachment purposes only.

37:59.578 --> 38:02.814
- Overruled.
Answer the question.

38:04.550 --> 38:06.652
- Did you arrest Mr. Trask
for possession of drugs?

38:06.685 --> 38:08.454
- I did.

38:08.487 --> 38:11.690
- And what was Mr. Trask doing
at 850 Pine Street?

38:11.723 --> 38:14.025
- He was there
shooting heroin with a friend,

38:14.059 --> 38:15.761
a kid named Tom Denalo.

38:15.794 --> 38:19.631
- Was Mr. Denalo
a passenger in Trask's car?

38:19.665 --> 38:22.100
- No.
Upon inspection of the house,

38:22.133 --> 38:24.803
I found Tom Denalo alone
in an upstairs bedroom.

38:24.836 --> 38:27.773
- And what happened to him?

38:27.806 --> 38:31.777
- He overdosed on heroin.

38:31.810 --> 38:34.780
He, uh--
he died in my arms.

38:34.813 --> 38:36.748
He was 19.

38:36.782 --> 38:39.351
- So the defendant ran away
while his friend was dying?

38:39.385 --> 38:40.752
- Yes.

38:45.857 --> 38:47.559
- Nothing further.

38:52.163 --> 38:55.834
Ladies and gentlemen, this whole
case comes down to one thing.

38:55.867 --> 38:57.503
Credibility.

38:57.536 --> 38:59.104
Is the defendant
a man of integrity?

38:59.137 --> 39:00.739
Someone you can trust?

39:00.772 --> 39:02.641
Based on the evidence
presented at trial,

39:02.674 --> 39:04.576
the answer to both those
questions is a resounding no.

39:04.610 --> 39:07.546
As Lieutenant Hill just told us,

39:07.579 --> 39:10.582
when he had the chance
to save his friend's life,

39:10.616 --> 39:12.451
the defendant ran away instead.

39:12.484 --> 39:14.453
Based on the evidence
you've heard,

39:14.486 --> 39:16.422
it's clear that the defendant

39:16.455 --> 39:19.758
knowingly used hypnosis
to rape Ms. Clarke.

39:19.791 --> 39:21.893
He didn't use simple charm.

39:21.927 --> 39:24.563
He used a proven
neuro-linguistic technique

39:24.596 --> 39:27.399
designed to disorient
and incapacitate.

39:27.433 --> 39:28.834
He even confessed this

39:28.867 --> 39:32.571
to his friend
and drug counselor, Jack Roe.

39:32.604 --> 39:34.139
Hypnotizing a woman
is no different

39:34.172 --> 39:35.841
than giving her
a date rape drug.

39:35.874 --> 39:38.109
It renders the victim helpless,

39:38.143 --> 39:42.681
and it makes her
legally incapable

39:42.714 --> 39:45.851
of consenting to sex.

39:45.884 --> 39:47.919
Therefore, the "yes" you heard

39:47.953 --> 39:49.888
from Ms. Clarke
on the audio recording--

39:49.921 --> 39:51.690
it--it's meaningless.

39:51.723 --> 39:55.627
As such, you have a legal
and moral obligation

39:55.661 --> 39:57.629
to find the defendant guilty.

40:07.573 --> 40:09.475
- Has the jury
reached a verdict?

40:09.508 --> 40:11.610
- We have, Your Honor.
- What say you?

40:11.643 --> 40:13.745
- On the charge of rape
in the first degree,

40:13.779 --> 40:16.715
we find the defendant guilty.

40:27.893 --> 40:29.628
- We did it.

40:29.661 --> 40:32.664
Congratulations.
- Yeah.

40:32.698 --> 40:34.600
[exhales softly]

40:35.967 --> 40:39.004
[indistinct murmuring]
- Let's go.

40:45.644 --> 40:47.813
- Hey.
- Abby?

40:47.846 --> 40:49.948
You okay?

40:49.981 --> 40:52.183
- I don't know.

40:52.217 --> 40:55.987
- You did a very brave thing.

40:56.021 --> 40:58.590
- Thanks for believing in me.

40:58.624 --> 41:00.659
I couldn't have done it
without your help.

41:00.692 --> 41:01.960
- It was all you.

41:01.993 --> 41:03.495
- Trask is going away
for a long time.

41:03.529 --> 41:04.963
- Good.

41:06.565 --> 41:09.968
I haven't heard from Steven
in three days.

41:10.001 --> 41:12.938
He won't return my calls.

41:12.971 --> 41:15.941
- Well, you know--

41:15.974 --> 41:19.811
well, maybe he just needs
a little time, you know.

41:19.845 --> 41:22.781
- I was looking so hard
for this amazing life.

41:22.814 --> 41:25.751
- Look, Abby,
you did nothing wrong.

41:25.784 --> 41:28.920
You were honest
about everything;

41:28.954 --> 41:31.557
about your life,
about your relationship,

41:31.590 --> 41:33.258
about Steven.

41:34.993 --> 41:37.896
If you want him back,
fight for him.

41:37.929 --> 41:41.700
But if he doesn't get it...

41:41.733 --> 41:44.570
it's not worth the fight.

41:52.043 --> 41:55.280
- Thank you again.
- Best of luck.

41:55.313 --> 41:56.915
- Take care.

42:02.888 --> 42:07.759
- Who knows?
Maybe it will all work out.

42:07.793 --> 42:10.796
- Yeah, I hope so.
