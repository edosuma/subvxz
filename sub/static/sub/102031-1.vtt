WEBVTT

01:56.818 --> 01:58.118
What do I owe you?

01:59.252 --> 02:00.655
Um, $600.

02:26.313 --> 02:27.481
Thank you, Mr. Baz.

02:27.515 --> 02:29.349
- Thank you.
- That's the door.

02:59.013 --> 03:02.182
You Jimmy? The private dick?

03:05.653 --> 03:07.822
I ain't never forget about the
man who ruined my marriage.

03:14.962 --> 03:16.196
Shit!

03:59.640 --> 04:00.775
Oh, shit!

04:02.777 --> 04:03.778
What the hell?

04:04.879 --> 04:07.982
Ah, this shit better be good.
It's 7:00 a.m. Fuck!

04:10.417 --> 04:11.586
Okay!

04:13.721 --> 04:16.724
- Hello.
- Are you Detective Jimmy Baz?

04:16.757 --> 04:18.325
Yeah, that's me.

04:19.026 --> 04:20.862
Our son is missing.

04:22.429 --> 04:24.297
Please help us find our son.

04:26.934 --> 04:30.938
Oh. Uh...
Let me put some pants on, okay?

04:30.972 --> 04:32.940
Um, please come in.
Come in, come in.

04:42.550 --> 04:44.018
Okay. Now, excuse the mess.

04:44.051 --> 04:46.721
I, um, I've been
working on a very big case last night.

04:47.755 --> 04:49.557
Can you find our son?

04:49.590 --> 04:52.960
Uh... One second.

04:52.994 --> 04:56.564
Okay, uh...
Please sit down. Please.

05:03.771 --> 05:04.872
Okay.

05:06.974 --> 05:08.943
How long
has he been missing for?

05:08.976 --> 05:10.443
Almost four days.

05:12.079 --> 05:13.848
Okay, and how old is he?

05:14.649 --> 05:15.750
Twenty-two.

05:16.784 --> 05:18.385
Twenty-two.

05:18.418 --> 05:22.623
And is it possible he could have gone off
with a friend or a girlfriend anywhere?

05:22.657 --> 05:26.393
He wouldn't have gone off without
telling us first, without calling us.

05:26.426 --> 05:28.830
He was supposed to come home
this weekend,

05:28.863 --> 05:32.399
and when we didn't hear from
him, we called, but nothing.

05:34.535 --> 05:36.838
Please, Mr. Baz.
The cops aren't doing anything,

05:36.871 --> 05:39.640
and we... we don't know
what we're supposed to do.

05:42.910 --> 05:44.612
I don't think
I'm the right guy for this.

05:45.546 --> 05:48.015
Your ad says you find people.

05:48.049 --> 05:51.819
I do, but it's usually people
who owe money.

05:51.853 --> 05:53.588
Well, we'll pay...

05:53.621 --> 05:56.090
whatever it takes
to help you find our Khalid.

05:56.123 --> 05:59.392
Please, Mr. Baz.
Khalid is a good boy.

05:59.426 --> 06:02.697
He wouldn't just disappear
like that without calling us.

06:02.730 --> 06:05.132
Something must have happened
to him.

06:06.734 --> 06:09.804
Look, I'm sorry. I'd...
I'd love to help you.

06:09.837 --> 06:12.974
I just don't think
I'm the right person for this.

06:13.007 --> 06:14.775
I think you should try
the police again.

06:19.614 --> 06:20.648
Come on, Anna.

06:29.156 --> 06:30.591
Is that your son?

06:32.827 --> 06:33.828
Yes.

06:37.899 --> 06:39.867
Then you can imagine
what it would feel like

06:39.901 --> 06:41.769
to learn that
your son is missing.

06:47.474 --> 06:50.144
Forget it, Anna.
We'll find someone better.

06:52.479 --> 06:54.015
Okay, okay.

06:56.483 --> 07:01.622
Just, uh, let me get myself together and...
I'll come by your place.

07:02.123 --> 07:04.491
3712 Kenwood Avenue.

07:05.660 --> 07:06.961
Thank you, Mr. Baz.

07:13.634 --> 07:14.635
Fuck.

07:38.526 --> 07:39.560
Mr. Baz.

07:43.764 --> 07:44.932
The police just got here.

07:44.966 --> 07:48.202
What? You just...
You told me they wouldn't help you.

07:48.235 --> 07:50.071
After hounding them all weekend,

07:50.104 --> 07:51.806
they finally sent over
a couple detectives

07:51.839 --> 07:53.574
to take down a report.

07:54.175 --> 07:55.176
Please come in.

07:59.146 --> 08:00.247
And, uh...

08:02.783 --> 08:04.452
When was the last time
you spoke to your son?

08:06.721 --> 08:09.757
Thursday night. He was supposed
to come home that weekend.

08:09.790 --> 08:11.892
Maybe he met a girl.
Uh...

08:11.926 --> 08:13.928
Went to Atlantic City
with his friends.

08:13.961 --> 08:15.763
He's in college, after all.

08:15.796 --> 08:18.599
No, he wouldn't go off like that
without calling us.

08:19.834 --> 08:21.302
We speak to him every night.

08:21.335 --> 08:23.304
We tried calling that weekend

08:23.337 --> 08:25.840
and it went straight
to voicemail.

08:25.873 --> 08:29.710
Last night we went to the dorm
room and we spoke to his roommate.

08:29.744 --> 08:32.179
And he said that he hadn't
been home all weekend.

08:33.714 --> 08:35.082
It's just not him.

08:35.116 --> 08:37.852
He just wouldn't disappear
like that.

08:38.586 --> 08:40.520
Well, legally, he's an adult.

08:41.087 --> 08:42.323
What does that matter?

08:42.356 --> 08:43.591
He's free to disappear
wherever he likes.

08:43.624 --> 08:47.661
Come on, Alves.
The kid's been missing for over 72 hours.

08:47.695 --> 08:49.130
Who is this guy? You know him?

08:49.530 --> 08:51.098
Hello, Jimmy.

08:51.132 --> 08:53.667
Jimmy Baz. I represent...

08:53.701 --> 08:55.102
The Turners.

08:55.136 --> 08:58.806
I represent the Turners. They hired
me as their private investigator.

09:00.041 --> 09:02.143
I didn't think you'd take
a case like this.

09:02.176 --> 09:04.078
Well, I did.

09:04.111 --> 09:05.946
Now, both of you
are going to get off your asses

09:05.980 --> 09:07.681
and help them find their kid?

09:07.715 --> 09:09.917
The kid is 22 years old.

09:09.950 --> 09:12.787
We can't go looking for
every college kid

09:12.820 --> 09:14.155
that goes off partying
for the weekend.

09:14.188 --> 09:16.090
Look, we told you.

09:16.624 --> 09:17.958
He wouldn't do that.

09:20.327 --> 09:23.631
Come on, Alves.
What if this kid is really missing?

09:24.999 --> 09:26.734
The least you can do is
put out an APB.

09:28.836 --> 09:31.005
Okay, Jimmy.
We'll look into it.

09:32.239 --> 09:33.808
- Come on, Amir.
- Let's go.

09:33.841 --> 09:35.142
Is it all right
if we hold on to this picture?

09:48.189 --> 09:49.623
Are you gonna help us?

09:57.231 --> 09:58.866
I hate to ask
this question, but...

10:00.201 --> 10:02.203
You're not
his biological parents, are you?

10:03.170 --> 10:04.705
No, we're not.

10:06.073 --> 10:08.375
We adopted him ten years ago.

10:08.409 --> 10:11.078
He was 12 years old,
an Afghani refugee.

10:13.981 --> 10:17.685
Any chance that he
reached out to his parents,

10:17.718 --> 10:19.620
or his parents reached out
to him?

10:22.723 --> 10:24.058
They're dead.

10:24.091 --> 10:27.928
He won't tell us much other than
he lost his parents in the war.

10:30.731 --> 10:31.832
May I see his room?

10:41.008 --> 10:42.109
He was a good boy.

10:42.810 --> 10:44.979
Always kept a very neat room.

10:46.480 --> 10:48.415
He was a straight-A student.

11:03.364 --> 11:06.033
He won first place at a
science fair in high school.

11:20.481 --> 11:23.784
A Quran. He's Muslim.

11:23.817 --> 11:27.922
We wanted him to practice
whatever religion he believed in.

11:38.799 --> 11:43.070
Did he attend the mosque
or any after-school activities?

11:43.103 --> 11:44.838
Not that we know of.

11:44.872 --> 11:46.340
He kept to himself
most of the time.

11:48.142 --> 11:50.811
Any friends?
Anybody he spent time with?

11:54.215 --> 11:55.349
He was a shy boy.

11:59.186 --> 12:01.755
So, the last person
to actually see Khalid

12:01.789 --> 12:03.157
was his college roommate?

12:04.325 --> 12:05.326
Yeah.

12:06.827 --> 12:08.195
And where does he live?

12:34.154 --> 12:36.824
I'm doing everything I can.
It's on you. You can't...

12:37.659 --> 12:39.793
Oh, what's up, man?
Can I help you?

12:39.827 --> 12:41.295
Does Khalid live here?

12:41.328 --> 12:43.130
Uh, yeah.

12:43.163 --> 12:45.533
I was hired by his parents
to find him.

12:47.001 --> 12:48.802
What? Oh, he hasn't
turned up yet?

12:48.836 --> 12:49.837
Mmm-mmm.

12:50.572 --> 12:51.839
Can I come in?

12:51.872 --> 12:54.375
Uh, yeah, man.
Yeah, come on.

12:54.408 --> 12:56.410
All right, time out, guys.
I got somebody at the door.

12:58.012 --> 12:59.179
Okay, ladies and gentlemen.

12:59.213 --> 13:01.115
Look, Amanda,
you always arguing with me about this.

13:01.148 --> 13:02.950
It's not that serious. I get it...

13:08.355 --> 13:10.257
So, when was the last time
you saw Khalid?

13:11.325 --> 13:13.460
Uh, I think it was on Thursday.

13:13.494 --> 13:15.362
I saw him in the morning
before class.

13:15.396 --> 13:19.500
Did he say anything, that he was
gonna go anywhere this weekend?

13:19.534 --> 13:21.536
I mean, he usually goes
to his parents' home

13:21.569 --> 13:24.138
and he helps them out with the
family business or something.

13:24.171 --> 13:26.373
Does he have any friends, like,
places he goes?

13:26.407 --> 13:28.142
Anywhere he would hang out
on the regular?

13:29.176 --> 13:30.477
Look, man, I...

13:30.512 --> 13:33.347
I never really saw him hanging
out with anyone around school.

13:33.380 --> 13:35.149
When you're studying
pharmacology, you know,

13:35.182 --> 13:38.152
it's usually pretty tough
with the courses, so...

13:38.185 --> 13:39.219
He's normally studying
all the time.

13:41.088 --> 13:42.956
You know, other than
studying at the library, though,

13:42.990 --> 13:46.160
I think he, um...
Think he studies at this hookah lounge.

13:47.461 --> 13:50.130
Hookah lounge?
You know which one? Where?

13:50.164 --> 13:53.033
Nah, man. Um... Um...

13:53.067 --> 13:55.235
It's out on Clinton, though.
I think it's in Clinton.

13:55.269 --> 13:57.004
- Clinton?
- Yeah.

13:57.037 --> 13:58.439
So... That's all I got, man.

14:01.208 --> 14:03.344
Um, can I see his room?

14:03.377 --> 14:06.313
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's right back here. I'll show you.

14:07.649 --> 14:10.284
He's normally pretty clean.
Really clean.

14:10.317 --> 14:11.352
Keeps everything neat.

14:14.254 --> 14:16.558
- Uh, I'll let you do it.
- Okay. Okay.

15:38.205 --> 15:41.275
Looks like he packed
to leave for a long time.

15:42.376 --> 15:44.546
Uh, I guess. I don't know.

15:45.580 --> 15:47.549
Can you do me a favor?

15:47.582 --> 15:50.384
Call me if you hear from him
or see him.

15:51.786 --> 15:52.986
Sure.

15:54.254 --> 15:55.389
Hope you find him.

16:32.560 --> 16:33.561
Hey.

16:34.294 --> 16:35.295
Can I help you?

16:36.430 --> 16:37.431
Yeah.

16:38.833 --> 16:40.067
You know who this kid is?

17:00.354 --> 17:01.689
I'm not the police.

17:01.723 --> 17:04.759
I'm a private investigator hired
by the family to find Khalid.

17:05.560 --> 17:07.127
He's been missing
since Thursday.

17:11.198 --> 17:12.299
Of course, I know Khalid.

17:13.535 --> 17:15.102
He often comes here to study.

17:17.771 --> 17:19.439
When was the last time
you saw Khalid?

17:20.775 --> 17:22.309
He was here Wednesday night.

17:24.344 --> 17:25.680
Was he alone?

17:27.247 --> 17:29.349
He's always alone.

17:29.383 --> 17:32.587
He comes here, he sits by the
window and studies quietly,

17:32.620 --> 17:34.589
smokes hookah
and drinks mint tea.

17:36.423 --> 17:40.127
Was there anything unusual or strange
about his behavior that night?

17:43.263 --> 17:45.633
Come to think of it,
he did run off in a hurry.

17:45.667 --> 17:48.268
I was at the bar,
preparing a hookah for a customer.

17:48.302 --> 17:51.539
When I looked up,
I saw Khalid run out the door.

17:51.573 --> 17:52.840
And he left the money
on the table.

17:53.841 --> 17:55.610
And that's strange because?

17:56.476 --> 17:59.781
Because Khalid is
a very polite young man.

17:59.814 --> 18:03.551
He always asks for a check
and wishes me a good night.

18:03.585 --> 18:05.452
I figured he lost track of time

18:05.485 --> 18:07.187
and needed to leave in a hurry.

18:09.557 --> 18:12.192
Or he was running away
from someone?

18:12.225 --> 18:15.329
I wouldn't know.
I can't imagine why, though.

18:17.532 --> 18:19.801
Is there anything else
you can tell me about Khalid?

18:22.870 --> 18:24.204
Wish I could help you more.

18:26.273 --> 18:27.542
Did you know
he was from Afghanistan?

18:32.547 --> 18:33.648
Have you tried
the hookah before?

18:35.449 --> 18:37.552
No, no, no.
I prefer the real thing.

18:38.686 --> 18:40.788
Here. Come.
Share one with me.

18:52.533 --> 18:53.868
He never told me, but I knew.

18:55.570 --> 18:58.573
- How did you know?
- 'Cause I can tell that look.

18:58.606 --> 19:02.275
The look on a person when they
come from a place of hell.

19:02.309 --> 19:05.713
And the war in Afghanistan made
the whole country a place of hell.

19:06.681 --> 19:08.215
I'm from Afghanistan.

19:08.248 --> 19:09.717
And when the Taliban came in,

19:09.751 --> 19:12.587
I was one of the first to join
the army with the Americans

19:12.620 --> 19:14.689
to fight against the Taliban.

19:14.722 --> 19:17.357
And for most of us
who fought with the Americans,

19:17.391 --> 19:19.259
we were given a special asylum

19:19.292 --> 19:21.529
and that's how
I came to this country.

19:21.562 --> 19:25.800
Fortunately for me,
I got out before things got really bad.

19:25.833 --> 19:27.869
My guess is that
Khalid was not that lucky.

19:28.836 --> 19:32.774
Yet, he came here every week,

19:32.807 --> 19:35.810
I guess, to have some sort of
a connection with his roots.

19:38.579 --> 19:39.580
Thank you.

19:40.480 --> 19:42.282
This is my card.

19:42.315 --> 19:43.851
Will you call me
if you hear anything

19:43.885 --> 19:46.154
or if you think of
anything else, Mr...

19:46.554 --> 19:47.622
Abdul Nafi.

19:48.990 --> 19:50.223
Thank you, Abdul.

20:16.984 --> 20:18.385
Hello?

20:18.418 --> 20:20.822
<i>Jimmy, it's Richard.</i>

20:20.855 --> 20:22.489
<i>I got something here
you might wanna see.</i>

20:23.725 --> 20:24.826
Is it Khalid?

20:24.859 --> 20:26.894
<i>No, but it could be
related to him.</i>

20:27.895 --> 20:29.997
Okay, text me the address.
I'll be right there.

20:34.635 --> 20:36.369
<i>We got the call
a little while ago.</i>

20:36.403 --> 20:38.740
A fisherman
stumbled upon the scene.

20:38.773 --> 20:42.309
Looks like the body has been
there since before the weekend.

20:42.342 --> 20:44.645
Guy's food truck was found
upstairs, packed and hitched.

20:44.679 --> 20:45.980
Looked like he was done
for the day.

20:50.383 --> 20:51.519
Jesus Christ, Alves!

20:52.754 --> 20:53.855
Someone did a number on him.

20:54.989 --> 20:56.624
His name is Mansour Shiek.

20:57.525 --> 20:58.860
Afghani.

20:58.893 --> 21:00.360
Came here
about eight years ago.

21:01.062 --> 21:02.362
See where I'm going with this?

21:03.898 --> 21:05.099
No, I don't.

21:05.133 --> 21:08.503
That missing kid, Khalid,
disappeared around the same time.

21:08.536 --> 21:10.571
And just like our victim,
he's Muslim.

21:13.040 --> 21:14.709
Maybe whoever did this
got to the kid.

21:15.643 --> 21:16.711
Thought you should know.

21:19.714 --> 21:21.414
Anybody see anything?

21:21.448 --> 21:22.917
Not yet.
They're still looking.

21:27.855 --> 21:30.691
"He but giveth them respite

21:30.725 --> 21:35.328
"against a day when the eyes
will fixedly stare in horror."

21:36.864 --> 21:38.733
Wha... What...
What is he saying?

21:40.367 --> 21:41.702
Who knows?

21:41.736 --> 21:44.539
But one dead Muslim and another
one goes missing days apart...

21:45.673 --> 21:47.440
I think we got ourselves
a Muslim-killer.

21:54.615 --> 21:55.650
Let me see that.

22:04.625 --> 22:07.595
No trauma to the head,
or abrasions.

22:07.628 --> 22:09.063
No ligatures on the wrists.

22:09.096 --> 22:11.098
Can't seem to find
any fingerprints.

22:15.503 --> 22:17.872
He has a puncture wound
on his neck.

22:17.905 --> 22:21.509
The poor bastard had his eyes
spooned out of his head.

22:21.542 --> 22:23.744
- What the fuck is he doing here?
- I called him.

22:23.778 --> 22:26.080
This is a fucking crime scene, Richard.
He can't be here.

22:26.113 --> 22:28.115
Look, I know.

22:28.149 --> 22:30.651
I just thought this had
something to do with his case.

22:30.685 --> 22:32.753
Plus, he's
a top-notch detective.

22:33.621 --> 22:35.756
We need a guy like this
on our side.

22:37.158 --> 22:38.826
And what if
the Captain comes here?

22:38.860 --> 22:40.728
That will be
both our asses on the line.

22:41.996 --> 22:43.030
Get him out of here.

22:46.567 --> 22:47.902
Think I'd
better get out of here.

22:47.935 --> 22:48.970
I'll walk you out.

22:50.872 --> 22:53.140
I'll let you know what we get
from the autopsy.

22:53.174 --> 22:54.407
Thanks, Alves.

22:56.143 --> 22:58.713
Jimmy, I want you to know...

23:01.015 --> 23:02.717
we did everything we could
to try to find him.

23:07.487 --> 23:08.488
Maybe.

23:11.792 --> 23:13.127
We did everything
we could, Jimmy.

24:49.690 --> 24:51.892
What's happening?
What's going on?

24:52.727 --> 24:54.195
Iman? Iman?

24:57.999 --> 24:59.000
Iman?

25:02.837 --> 25:04.939
It's you.

25:04.972 --> 25:07.641
No, no, no. Please, please.
It wasn't my fault.

25:09.310 --> 25:11.779
I asked Allah for forgiveness.

25:11.812 --> 25:13.948
No, please.
Please forgive me!

25:30.831 --> 25:31.832
Hello?

25:32.299 --> 25:34.635
Baz, it's me.

25:35.302 --> 25:37.004
There's been another homicide.

25:38.773 --> 25:40.741
Where are you?
I'll be right there.

25:41.308 --> 25:42.843
I can't do that, Jimmy.

25:43.344 --> 25:45.179
This just got real.

25:45.212 --> 25:47.048
The press is all over it.

25:47.081 --> 25:49.784
They're calling him
the Muslim-Killer.

25:49.817 --> 25:52.887
Meet me in 30 at a diner
on Brentford and Castle.

25:54.822 --> 25:55.990
I got some info.

25:57.758 --> 25:58.759
Okay.

26:02.930 --> 26:06.000
<i>Police were notified
of a homicide early this morning.</i>

26:06.033 --> 26:08.669
<i>The victim is
Sameer Ashan, 52,</i>

26:08.702 --> 26:10.704
<i>and a valued member
of the community.</i>

26:10.738 --> 26:13.808
<i>Sources say he is the second
Muslim person to be killed</i>

26:13.841 --> 26:17.378
<i>in the course of several days,
and a young Muslim man is missing,</i>

26:17.411 --> 26:18.946
- <i>and might be the third victim.</i>
- Shit!

26:22.116 --> 26:24.185
Mr. Baz, is it true?

26:24.218 --> 26:26.020
- Is Khalid dead?
- No, we don't know that.

26:26.053 --> 26:27.755
It's all over the news.
They're saying that

26:27.788 --> 26:30.057
the police thinks that
Khalid's one of the victims.

26:30.091 --> 26:32.159
Listen, I don't know
how it got out there, okay?

26:32.193 --> 26:35.196
But the fact that they didn't find
Khalid is a good thing, all right?

26:35.229 --> 26:37.832
Now, listen, you have the whole state
of New Jersey now looking for him,

26:37.865 --> 26:39.166
'cause this case
just got elevated.

26:39.200 --> 26:42.036
I'm on my way right now
to meet Detective Alves.

26:42.069 --> 26:44.271
Okay? Listen.
Things will be fine.

26:44.305 --> 26:45.906
We're gonna find Khalid, okay?

26:45.940 --> 26:48.175
I will find Khalid. Okay?
I will find him.

26:57.418 --> 26:58.652
Hey.

27:03.390 --> 27:05.192
- You want something?
- Yeah.

27:05.226 --> 27:09.163
I'll have coffee, black,
and... whatever he's having.

27:11.699 --> 27:14.802
So, who leaked about the second
murder and about the kid?

27:16.137 --> 27:18.305
Maybe it was you?

27:18.339 --> 27:20.774
Maybe you thought you'd get more
eyeballs looking for the missing kid.

27:22.810 --> 27:24.211
Is this guy serious, or what?

27:24.245 --> 27:25.279
Let's all calm down.

27:26.814 --> 27:29.683
Amir, I told you,
Jimmy can be trusted.

27:29.717 --> 27:32.119
I don't get why
we're wasting our time

27:32.153 --> 27:34.221
sitting with this deadbeat
when we got a killer to find.

27:34.255 --> 27:36.323
It's called
professional courtesy.

27:36.357 --> 27:37.892
We're all trying to get to
the bottom of something.

27:37.925 --> 27:40.127
This goes
beyond professional courtesy.

27:40.161 --> 27:41.596
I don't know what he has on you,

27:41.630 --> 27:44.331
but ever since we saw him at the house,
you haven't been acting the same.

27:46.200 --> 27:47.968
I'm gonna wait by the car
and make some calls.

27:48.002 --> 27:50.037
You know,
some real police work.

27:56.243 --> 27:57.478
What's up his ass?

27:57.512 --> 27:59.680
He's a little rough around the
edges, but he's a good cop.

28:01.282 --> 28:04.118
Look, with all this happening,
you know,

28:04.151 --> 28:06.253
his people getting killed,
he's kind of on the edge.

28:06.287 --> 28:08.889
I think you can understand that.

28:08.923 --> 28:11.292
Okay, okay, what do you got?

28:12.159 --> 28:13.694
His name is Sameer Ashan,

28:14.428 --> 28:16.463
also from Afghanistan.

28:16.497 --> 28:19.166
His wife went down
to the kitchen,

28:19.200 --> 28:21.035
someone came up
from behind her,

28:21.068 --> 28:23.103
put a needle in her neck
and she passed out.

28:23.137 --> 28:25.472
When she woke up,
that's how she found her husband.

28:27.241 --> 28:31.278
"Let not your own hand
contribute to your destruction."

28:31.312 --> 28:34.882
Hmm. Well, we definitely
have a pattern.

28:36.217 --> 28:38.919
Forensic came back
with the autopsy.

28:38.953 --> 28:41.822
The same puncture that
Sameer has,

28:41.855 --> 28:43.057
the first victim had as well.

28:43.891 --> 28:45.459
Vecuronium bromide.

28:47.529 --> 28:49.163
English, Alves.

28:49.196 --> 28:52.499
Vecuronium bromide is
a muscle relaxant.

28:52.534 --> 28:56.103
It's used in executions
to paralyze the inmates.

28:56.136 --> 28:58.939
Here's the thing.
It doesn't knock you out.

28:58.973 --> 29:02.276
So, this poor bastard felt every single
moment of his eyes being gouged out.

29:04.845 --> 29:06.814
Who's got access
to stuff like that?

29:06.847 --> 29:09.049
With all the controversy
behind the executions,

29:09.083 --> 29:11.252
pharmaceuticals
stopped selling it.

29:11.285 --> 29:14.388
Just a few prisons and some
pharmacies still got some stock left.

29:14.421 --> 29:15.990
I got my guys trying to see

29:16.023 --> 29:17.458
if there's anything
that's been unaccounted for.

29:18.859 --> 29:21.962
Good. I'll work on that, too.

29:21.996 --> 29:23.264
So, who do you like for this?

29:25.366 --> 29:27.001
His name is John Doyle.

29:27.034 --> 29:28.936
Typical white supremacist.

29:28.969 --> 29:32.473
Rolls with a rough group of the
Heathens here in Jersey City.

29:32.507 --> 29:35.909
They've been known to cook
meth, and John is the top chef.

29:35.943 --> 29:38.112
He's been suspected of
killing two Mexicans

29:38.145 --> 29:39.179
from a rival bike gang.

29:41.282 --> 29:43.117
The Banditos?

29:43.150 --> 29:45.219
Yeah. Don't you got an inside
with them?

29:46.987 --> 29:49.923
Yeah, just...
That was a long time ago.

29:49.957 --> 29:52.926
And also suspected of killing
two Muslims.

29:52.960 --> 29:55.396
He got put away for ten years
for a large batch of meth.

29:56.897 --> 29:58.899
Got out two weeks ago.

29:58.932 --> 30:01.402
Last week, he missed his
meeting with his parole officer.

30:05.072 --> 30:06.608
So you think this is our guy?

30:06.641 --> 30:10.978
Hates foreigners, was missing
at the time of the murder,

30:11.011 --> 30:13.447
knows his way around a pharmacy.
It's not much of a stretch.

30:16.950 --> 30:18.218
Why go through
all that trouble?

30:19.253 --> 30:21.188
Why write the phrases?

30:21.221 --> 30:24.626
Why not kill the wife?
And why only Afghani men?

30:24.659 --> 30:27.895
Why not a Persian, or a
Palestinian, or anybody else?

30:27.928 --> 30:30.164
'Cause he's a nut
who likes to kill people

30:30.197 --> 30:32.966
and he's got a hard-on
for Afghanis.

30:33.000 --> 30:37.137
Look, I don't know,
but it's the best lead we got.

30:37.171 --> 30:39.607
Me and Amir are going to check
out the local Pagan hangouts.

30:39.641 --> 30:41.175
We'll let you know
if we find him.

30:42.443 --> 30:45.412
Okay. I'll look into it, too.

30:47.682 --> 30:49.183
We'll find him, Jimmy.

31:13.374 --> 31:14.408
Members only.

31:16.110 --> 31:18.078
I'm here to see Miguel.

31:22.082 --> 31:24.051
You got the wrong place.

31:24.084 --> 31:25.452
There is no Miguel in here.

31:31.258 --> 31:33.160
I'm not looking for trouble.

31:33.193 --> 31:34.529
It's too late for that.

31:35.996 --> 31:38.265
You already found some trouble.

31:43.671 --> 31:46.140
Tell Miguel Jimmy Baz is here,

31:46.173 --> 31:47.474
and I want to see him.

31:49.176 --> 31:50.177
Gelasio.

32:29.617 --> 32:32.052
Jimmy Baz.

32:34.221 --> 32:36.123
How long has it been, Jimmy?

32:36.156 --> 32:38.760
Not since I lost my badge.

32:38.793 --> 32:41.061
That's right.

32:42.697 --> 32:44.666
I remember that.

32:54.742 --> 32:55.743
What, Jimmy?

32:59.079 --> 33:01.381
You think, just because
you lose your son,

33:01.415 --> 33:04.084
I'm gonna have a soft spot for you?
Is that what you think?

33:07.488 --> 33:10.190
But you still have the balls
to come into my place.

33:12.292 --> 33:14.127
I've got some information
you might want.

33:15.630 --> 33:16.631
I'm listening.

33:18.198 --> 33:19.567
I'm looking for a missing kid.

33:20.835 --> 33:23.571
And why should I give a fuck?

33:23.605 --> 33:26.741
Because there's a killer out
there and he's targeting Muslims.

33:26.774 --> 33:29.476
You're gonna go
straight to the point, Jimmy.

33:29.511 --> 33:31.579
And that killer
might be John Doyle.

33:31.613 --> 33:34.214
Who the fuck is John Doyle?

33:34.248 --> 33:36.316
He's a cooker for the Heathens.

33:36.350 --> 33:38.085
And he took out
two of your guys.

33:44.526 --> 33:47.562
He just got out of jail
and he went missing.

33:56.136 --> 33:57.371
What do want from me, Jimmy?

33:58.573 --> 34:00.207
His location.

34:00.240 --> 34:01.543
You want his location?

34:02.744 --> 34:04.278
Why would I give you
his location

34:04.311 --> 34:06.179
if I can take care of that
by myself?

34:06.213 --> 34:07.649
Well, maybe I can take him out,

34:09.283 --> 34:10.585
take down their drug business.

34:11.819 --> 34:13.353
You don't have to risk anything.

34:15.790 --> 34:16.824
I'll think about it.

34:18.492 --> 34:20.060
Gelasio.

34:27.400 --> 34:31.271
Hey, Jimmy, whatever happened to
that beautiful ex-wife you had?

34:31.304 --> 34:32.607
Susan Parker.

34:33.473 --> 34:35.175
31 Clinton Ave.

34:41.649 --> 34:43.116
Susan Parker, huh?

34:49.322 --> 34:51.123
Hey, wait!

34:56.563 --> 34:59.299
Miguel said to look for the
abandoned house on the road.

35:01.903 --> 35:03.771
He also said
not to let him down.

35:06.239 --> 35:07.240
Thank you.

35:10.410 --> 35:11.512
Fulton Street.

35:38.606 --> 35:40.407
You sure about this?

35:40.440 --> 35:43.811
No, but, that's as good as any
meth house you're gonna get.

35:43.845 --> 35:45.780
Well, let's go check it out.

35:45.813 --> 35:47.815
All right. We'll check it out.
You stay here.

35:47.849 --> 35:49.584
If anything happens,
we'll call it in.

35:49.617 --> 35:51.619
Hey, Alves,
you're fucking buggin'

35:51.653 --> 35:53.755
if you think you're just
gonna go in there without me.

35:53.788 --> 35:56.691
You heard him. We can't have a
civilian stake out a meth house.

35:56.724 --> 36:00.227
I've been busting people before you
were even on the force, all right?

36:00.260 --> 36:01.796
So don't worry about me, buddy.
Come on.

36:04.632 --> 36:05.633
Are you packin'?

36:10.738 --> 36:12.907
Yeah, all right, fine.

36:12.940 --> 36:15.576
We'll go through the back.
You watch the front.

36:15.610 --> 36:17.745
- Okay.
- Make sure you don't shoot one of us.

36:17.779 --> 36:20.313
- Not on purpose.
- This is not a game.

37:32.620 --> 37:33.855
Rise and shine!

37:34.889 --> 37:35.923
Get the fuck up.

37:37.525 --> 37:40.695
Hey. I wanna see you
get the fuck up.

37:40.728 --> 37:41.863
Ready for your medicine?

37:43.831 --> 37:44.932
Come on.

37:47.735 --> 37:49.269
Gonna hose you off.

37:55.743 --> 37:58.579
<i>Por favor,</i> yeah, <i>por favor!</i>

38:02.049 --> 38:04.652
Oh, yeah, take some more.

38:06.521 --> 38:07.989
Drop it! Drop the needle.

38:09.724 --> 38:11.759
Hands on your head.
Turn around slowly.

38:15.395 --> 38:17.765
- Is she the only one here?
- Maybe.

38:19.133 --> 38:20.768
Did you kill
those two Muslim men?

38:21.669 --> 38:23.538
I killed many Muslim men.

38:24.105 --> 38:25.472
Khalid, is he in here?

38:27.542 --> 38:29.010
- Maybe.
- Where's Khalid?

38:29.877 --> 38:30.878
He's here.

38:31.979 --> 38:33.480
Twelve-year-old white kid?

38:33.514 --> 38:35.482
Yeah, I got him.

38:49.130 --> 38:50.565
Freeze! Stop right there.

39:01.042 --> 39:03.711
Khalid...

39:03.744 --> 39:05.079
You don't know
who Khalid is, do you?

39:22.897 --> 39:25.099
Looks like they robbed
a pharmacy.

39:25.132 --> 39:27.467
Found a shitload of
pharmaceuticals in the house.

39:28.035 --> 39:29.103
Any signs of Khalid?

39:29.136 --> 39:30.605
They're still canvassing
the area.

39:30.638 --> 39:31.973
I'll let you know
if anything shows up.

39:34.642 --> 39:37.578
You should go home and get some rest.
You look like shit.

39:37.612 --> 39:40.548
Plus, we need you in the morning at
the station to file an incident report.

39:42.550 --> 39:43.584
Jimmy.

39:45.586 --> 39:46.621
Good work today.

39:58.165 --> 40:00.601
<i>I want you to know...</i>

40:00.635 --> 40:02.870
I did everything I possibly
could to try to find him.

40:08.743 --> 40:09.877
Is that your son?

40:15.917 --> 40:18.052
<i>Then you can imagine
what it would feel like</i>

40:18.085 --> 40:20.121
<i>to learn that
your son is missing.</i>

40:29.764 --> 40:32.667
Well, Jimmy, I'll let you know
if anything turns up.

40:33.634 --> 40:35.202
So, that's it?

40:36.037 --> 40:37.805
Well, we got our man.

40:37.838 --> 40:39.240
Did we?

40:39.273 --> 40:41.142
You said it yourself.

40:41.175 --> 40:44.145
John admitted to killing
the Muslim men.

40:44.178 --> 40:46.080
I also told you I thought
he was fucking with me.

40:46.914 --> 40:48.516
Got the bad guys, Jimmy.

40:49.884 --> 40:51.652
You know, your partner,
he didn't have to shoot him.

40:52.286 --> 40:53.521
Yeah, well...

40:54.922 --> 40:56.557
You're right.

40:56.590 --> 40:59.627
We'll have some time to think
about that while they're investigating.

41:24.919 --> 41:26.921
You said I should call you
if I think of anything.

41:27.688 --> 41:28.689
I did.

41:30.291 --> 41:32.626
I told you I was in Afghanistan
at the start of the war.

41:34.762 --> 41:37.497
Afghanistan was divided amongst
different warlords.

41:38.566 --> 41:40.134
Then, the Taliban came in

41:40.167 --> 41:42.603
and they quickly spread
throughout the country.

41:44.038 --> 41:46.774
The Taliban enforced
strict Muslim law.

41:46.807 --> 41:49.977
Any Afghani who was caught
breaking any of their laws

41:50.011 --> 41:53.781
was tortured
and brutally killed.

41:53.814 --> 41:55.883
As bad as the Taliban were,

41:55.916 --> 41:57.752
the warlords
were not any better.

41:59.920 --> 42:02.990
Anyways, when I was
in the Afghani Army,

42:03.024 --> 42:05.626
my division was sent to
a remote village

42:05.659 --> 42:08.329
along the lines
with the Taliban forces.

42:08.362 --> 42:12.900
And this village has a police
force led by a local warlord.

42:14.769 --> 42:18.005
It was here
that I met these two men.

42:26.013 --> 42:27.615
These two were
in the same squadron?

42:28.983 --> 42:30.684
Any chance this could be
a coincidence?

42:32.019 --> 42:33.020
Maybe.

42:35.022 --> 42:37.258
But these were
not good men.

42:37.291 --> 42:39.894
Have you ever heard of
<i>Bacha Bazi?</i>

42:39.927 --> 42:41.595
<i>Bacha Bazi?</i>

42:41.629 --> 42:42.897
I'm not proud of this,

42:42.930 --> 42:45.366
but in Afghanistan,
there's this thing

42:45.399 --> 42:48.269
that some of
the most powerful men do.

42:48.302 --> 42:52.673
The more powerful you are,
the more <i>Bachi Bareech</i> you have.

42:54.341 --> 42:56.343
<i>Bacha Bazi</i> are young boys,

42:56.377 --> 43:01.015
normally ranging from the age
of 12 up to to their early 20s.

43:01.048 --> 43:04.351
They're either stolen,
or bought from their parents,

43:04.385 --> 43:08.122
and made to dress like girls
for their masters.

43:09.290 --> 43:10.658
Basically prostitutes.

43:14.929 --> 43:17.998
These men were having sex
with those boys?

43:20.267 --> 43:21.335
Yes.

43:23.437 --> 43:26.707
I was invited to a dinner
where a local police chief

43:26.740 --> 43:29.376
had his <i>Bacha Bareech</i>
dancing for his troops.

43:29.410 --> 43:32.947
And these men were
repeatedly raping these boys.

43:32.980 --> 43:36.117
I wanted nothing to do with it,
so I left.

43:36.150 --> 43:38.953
I wish I had the courage
to kill those monsters,

43:38.986 --> 43:41.188
but, we were in a war.

43:41.222 --> 43:44.625
Every man was necessary to fight
the war against the Taliban.

43:49.163 --> 43:51.165
Does any of this
mean anything to you?

43:52.333 --> 43:54.201
"He but giveth them respite

43:54.235 --> 43:57.938
"against a day when the eyes
will fixedly stare in horror,"

43:57.972 --> 44:01.142
or, "Let not your own hands
contribute to your destruction."

44:01.175 --> 44:02.276
Destruction.

44:03.377 --> 44:05.045
Yes, they're from the Quran.

44:09.750 --> 44:10.851
What was the name of that town?

44:11.719 --> 44:13.954
- Darzab.
- Darzab?

44:15.890 --> 44:18.225
Darzab. Thank you.

45:06.307 --> 45:08.876
Hey, Alves,
sorry to call so early.

45:08.909 --> 45:11.245
Um, you think you can swing by?

45:11.278 --> 45:13.280
I got something
I want to show you.

45:18.252 --> 45:19.720
Come in. It's open.

45:27.161 --> 45:28.162
Hey, Jimmy.

45:29.163 --> 45:30.297
Everything okay, buddy?

45:31.131 --> 45:32.233
You want coffee?

45:32.266 --> 45:35.135
I got coffee brewing,
and I got whiskey on my desk.

45:35.169 --> 45:36.538
Help yourself.

45:36.571 --> 45:37.905
Don't mind if I do.

45:39.006 --> 45:40.474
It's not like
I got anywhere to be.

45:41.809 --> 45:43.777
They gave Amir and me
two weeks off.

45:44.979 --> 45:46.113
Oh, shit!

45:47.047 --> 45:48.249
Ah, no big deal.

45:49.584 --> 45:50.851
It's paid.

45:51.986 --> 45:52.987
That's not what I meant.

45:55.089 --> 45:56.857
We didn't get our guy.

45:56.890 --> 45:59.093
Look, Jimmy, I know
you want to find the kid.

45:59.860 --> 46:01.228
I do, too,

46:01.262 --> 46:03.497
but you know better than anyone
else that not everyone is found.

46:07.868 --> 46:08.902
I didn't mean that.

46:10.137 --> 46:12.806
I just mean that
we most likely got our man.

46:15.242 --> 46:17.011
Take a look.
I got something to show you.

46:17.444 --> 46:18.479
Here.

46:20.281 --> 46:21.549
Ron Burns, okay?

46:21.583 --> 46:24.552
Missing. 2009, December first.

46:24.586 --> 46:27.454
Okay? Here. Another kid.

46:27.488 --> 46:31.158
Eric Dunbar. 2012,
nine years old.

46:31.191 --> 46:32.493
Okay? Here we go.

46:32.527 --> 46:35.597
Victor Hughes. Missing.
Nine years old.

46:35.630 --> 46:40.401
June 20, okay? Ali Abbas.
Missing, 2010.

46:40.434 --> 46:42.236
What is all of this?

46:42.269 --> 46:45.205
Johnny Baz.
Missing since 2008!

46:50.244 --> 46:52.413
Holy shit, Jimmy.

46:52.446 --> 46:54.248
You've kept the case going
all these years.

46:57.084 --> 46:58.152
You ever heard of <i>Bacha Bazi?</i>

46:59.053 --> 47:00.054
<i>Bacha,</i> what?

47:00.087 --> 47:02.956
Look, Jimmy, tomorrow morning
I'll pick you up

47:02.990 --> 47:04.291
and I'll take you over to
Dr. Kelan.

47:04.325 --> 47:05.926
Remember him? He's got
his own practice now.

47:05.959 --> 47:09.029
<i>Bacha Bazi.</i> It's a practice
in Afghanistan

47:09.063 --> 47:11.932
where these warlords grab boys
eight to twelve years old,

47:11.965 --> 47:14.301
dress them up like women and
they use them as sex slaves.

47:14.335 --> 47:15.369
Jesus Christ, Jimmy!

47:15.402 --> 47:17.605
A special visa program.
You ever hear about that?

47:17.639 --> 47:18.472
No!

47:18.506 --> 47:20.240
Special visa program
in Afghanistan,

47:20.274 --> 47:21.942
where they give
any Afghan soldier

47:21.975 --> 47:23.477
a special visa
to come to the States

47:23.511 --> 47:25.913
if you fight against the Taliban
in the war.

47:25.946 --> 47:27.281
Where are you going
with this, Jimmy?

47:27.314 --> 47:31.051
Listen to me. What if a warlord
came here on that special visa

47:31.085 --> 47:34.054
and he continued his <i>Bacha
Bazi</i> practice right here?

47:34.088 --> 47:35.657
I think
that's a bit of a stretch.

47:35.690 --> 47:37.157
Yeah, maybe.

47:38.425 --> 47:40.427
What if I told you
our two last victims...

47:40.461 --> 47:42.496
right there,

47:42.530 --> 47:43.997
they were in the same group

47:44.031 --> 47:46.266
where their warlord
practiced <i>Bacha Bazi.</i>

47:57.177 --> 47:58.178
Really?

47:58.713 --> 47:59.913
Yeah.

48:01.716 --> 48:03.484
You still got
military contacts?

48:03.518 --> 48:06.186
I did two tours in Iraq,
so, yeah.

48:06.220 --> 48:10.057
Okay, I need you to find out
what local militia group

48:10.090 --> 48:12.527
worked with the Americans
in a town called Darzab

48:13.093 --> 48:15.062
in 2007,

48:15.095 --> 48:17.665
and who got a special visa
from that place.

48:17.699 --> 48:19.667
And these are the two vics
from this town?

48:19.701 --> 48:21.001
Yes.

48:21.034 --> 48:24.071
And what about Khalid?
What does he have to do with all this?

48:24.104 --> 48:27.675
I don't know. I don't know.

48:27.709 --> 48:32.045
Did you get any information
on that vecuronium bromide?

48:32.079 --> 48:34.549
Not yet. Amir was supposed to
look into that,

48:34.582 --> 48:37.184
but we're suspended.

48:37.217 --> 48:39.953
I'll call the office today
and see if anything's turned up.

48:39.987 --> 48:41.589
Okay. Thanks, Alves.

48:41.623 --> 48:44.224
Uh, come, I'll walk you out.

48:44.258 --> 48:45.325
And where are you going?

48:47.394 --> 48:48.996
I'm gonna go follow a hunch.

48:56.638 --> 48:59.106
Jimmy.

48:59.139 --> 49:02.209
I want you to know, I never forgave
myself for not finding Johnny.

49:05.513 --> 49:06.548
I know.

49:08.048 --> 49:09.116
Neither did I.

49:20.127 --> 49:22.296
What are you looking for?
What is it?

49:33.273 --> 49:34.475
Can I hold onto this?

49:35.375 --> 49:36.644
Sure.

49:36.678 --> 49:38.979
What town in Afghanistan
was Khalid from?

49:40.147 --> 49:41.549
I don't remember.

49:41.583 --> 49:43.050
Would it be
in your adoption papers?

49:43.718 --> 49:44.752
Maybe.

49:55.195 --> 49:56.463
It says here that

49:56.497 --> 49:59.066
he was found
in a town called...

49:59.099 --> 50:00.200
Darzab?

50:01.636 --> 50:03.403
Yeah, that's right.

50:07.742 --> 50:12.112
Do you think that, uh,
some relatives took him?

50:24.491 --> 50:27.762
Anna, where is your husband
right now?

50:27.795 --> 50:29.229
At our pharmacy.

50:32.466 --> 50:35.102
- What? What is it?
- Nothing, I'm...

50:36.303 --> 50:38.438
trying to put
the pieces together. Um...

50:38.472 --> 50:41.074
Do you think that you know
what happened to Khalid, then?

50:42.744 --> 50:43.745
I gotta go.

50:45.245 --> 50:48.315
Do you... Do you think that
he's still alive?

50:49.617 --> 50:50.685
Answer me.

50:52.352 --> 50:54.722
I do think he's alive.

50:54.756 --> 50:57.659
And I'm going to do everything
I can to keep it that way.

51:22.684 --> 51:23.685
Mr. Baz.

51:24.552 --> 51:25.853
Any word on Khalid?

51:25.887 --> 51:28.690
Not quite.
Can I talk to you for a moment?

51:29.891 --> 51:31.091
Yeah, sure.

51:37.464 --> 51:38.800
What is it?

51:38.833 --> 51:41.636
Um, do you know what
vecuronium bromide is?

51:42.502 --> 51:43.871
Yes, of course.

51:43.905 --> 51:46.173
You don't keep
any of that stuff here, do you?

51:46.206 --> 51:48.576
No. I mean, not any more.

51:50.410 --> 51:51.613
What do you mean?

51:51.646 --> 51:54.582
Well, when I bought the
pharmacy a couple of years ago,

51:54.616 --> 51:57.351
the inventory said there
was one batch left in stock,

51:57.384 --> 52:00.253
but when I did the inventory
myself, I never found it.

52:00.287 --> 52:01.388
I figured it was an error.

52:04.191 --> 52:06.493
What's this all about?
I told the police this.

52:07.762 --> 52:09.530
Wait, what police?

52:09.564 --> 52:14.301
Well, you know, uh,
Officer Amjad.

52:14.334 --> 52:17.237
Officer Amjad came here
asking about the drug?

52:17.270 --> 52:19.941
- When was this?
- Yesterday.

52:19.974 --> 52:23.143
He said he was investigating
an unrelated case.

52:25.278 --> 52:26.547
What does this have to do
with Khalid?

52:28.916 --> 52:30.183
I think I better go.

52:32.285 --> 52:33.521
Wha... Mr. Baz, wait.

52:34.589 --> 52:35.590
What's going on?

52:38.492 --> 52:39.560
What about Khalid?

52:43.665 --> 52:46.299
- <i>Hey, Jimmy, I'm...</i>
- Any luck with those names?

52:46.333 --> 52:48.268
<i>If you let me finish,
I was going to tell you</i>

52:48.301 --> 52:49.871
<i>my buddy in the Marines
gave me a contact number</i>

52:49.904 --> 52:51.706
<i>to a Sgt. Brian O'Connell.</i>

52:51.739 --> 52:53.173
<i>He did two tours
in Afghanistan,</i>

52:53.206 --> 52:56.243
<i>and during one of them,
he was stationed near the town of Darzab.</i>

52:56.276 --> 52:57.411
<i>And he'd know who got the visas</i>

52:57.444 --> 52:58.946
<i>because he was the one
giving out the recommendations.</i>

52:58.980 --> 53:01.816
- <i>I'm heading there now.</i>
- Okay, send me the address. I'll meet you there.

53:04.284 --> 53:07.320
Hey, Alves, have you spoken to
Amir since the other day?

53:07.689 --> 53:08.723
<i>No, why?</i>

53:10.323 --> 53:12.292
Nothing.
Okay, I'll see you soon.

53:23.437 --> 53:24.772
Kind of like old times,
huh, Jimmy?

53:24.806 --> 53:26.574
Yeah, like old times.

53:29.977 --> 53:31.411
What do you want?

53:31.445 --> 53:33.313
Sgt. Brian O'Connell?

53:39.587 --> 53:40.855
Yeah, who's asking?

53:41.823 --> 53:44.324
I'm Detective Alves.

53:44.357 --> 53:45.827
And this is my associate, uh...

53:46.794 --> 53:48.730
Investigator Baz.

53:48.763 --> 53:50.765
We wanted to ask
a few questions.

53:59.974 --> 54:01.776
That's a pretty nasty injury
you got there.

54:01.809 --> 54:03.644
Yeah, car bomb.

54:03.678 --> 54:05.245
Blew the doors off the Humvee.

54:06.379 --> 54:08.015
Guy next to me
took most of the blast.

54:08.049 --> 54:09.349
He didn't make it.

54:09.382 --> 54:10.785
Shrapnel shredded my knee,

54:10.818 --> 54:12.954
so I guess I got the best,
uh, part of the deal, huh?

54:16.824 --> 54:19.994
Now, you guys are interrupting my show.
What it is you want?

54:20.027 --> 54:25.566
Were you stationed at a town
called Darzab in 2005, 2006?

54:25.600 --> 54:27.467
I was stationed
in many places.

54:27.501 --> 54:29.937
We know you were there.
We got your service records.

54:29.971 --> 54:32.540
Okay, maybe I was there.
What of it?

54:32.573 --> 54:34.307
Did you work with
the local militia?

54:34.909 --> 54:37.344
Yeah, sure, I did.

54:38.846 --> 54:39.914
Did you know these men?

54:43.785 --> 54:45.820
I can't... I can't say.

54:45.853 --> 54:49.422
You can imagine.
I try not to think about those days.

54:49.456 --> 54:52.627
Take a closer look.
These men were murdered.

54:52.660 --> 54:54.394
Maybe you can help us
catch a killer.

54:54.427 --> 54:55.763
Murdered?

54:55.797 --> 54:58.900
Sure.
We wouldn't want that, would we?

55:26.761 --> 55:27.829
Isn't that Amir?

55:28.328 --> 55:30.363
No, that can't be.

55:31.098 --> 55:33.067
Yeah. Amir Amjad. That's him.

55:34.836 --> 55:36.604
He told me he got out
before the war.

55:36.637 --> 55:37.772
Yeah, well, he lied.

55:41.509 --> 55:44.411
Who else from here
got a visa?

55:44.444 --> 55:46.113
Well, the only other one
to survive who got the visa

55:46.147 --> 55:48.115
was Hadi Shezad.

55:48.149 --> 55:49.550
He's the guy next to Amir.

55:52.854 --> 55:53.955
Is there anything else?

55:54.789 --> 55:55.857
Yes.

55:57.490 --> 55:58.559
You recognize this kid?

55:59.961 --> 56:01.062
He's from that town.

56:12.106 --> 56:13.941
Look, I've, uh...

56:13.975 --> 56:15.910
I've answered
all your questions, okay?

56:16.476 --> 56:17.945
Now get the fuck out.

56:17.979 --> 56:19.080
Tell me about <i>Bacha Bazi.</i>

56:21.048 --> 56:22.516
What do they do to those kids?

56:36.063 --> 56:38.833
You have no idea what I
have to live with everyday.

56:41.702 --> 56:44.505
I, uh, I knew what
they were doing to those boys.

56:46.107 --> 56:48.643
They would steal them
from neighboring villages,

56:51.979 --> 56:53.547
take them from their families.

56:55.216 --> 56:56.717
They'd dress them up
like girls

56:58.052 --> 56:59.186
and they'd have their way
with them.

57:01.956 --> 57:04.759
And my commanders knew.
I told them.

57:04.792 --> 57:06.227
I sent reports,

57:06.260 --> 57:09.730
so many reports that
they straight out told me

57:09.764 --> 57:11.766
to keep my mouth shut.

57:11.799 --> 57:13.601
That it was
part of their custom.

57:14.936 --> 57:16.436
We had to respect that.

57:19.774 --> 57:22.843
But I knew what the un...
unspoken truth was.

57:23.878 --> 57:25.513
In the war with the Taliban,

57:25.546 --> 57:28.983
we were to do
whatever it takes to win.

57:29.016 --> 57:31.218
Even if that meant teaming up
with a pedophile, okay?

57:31.252 --> 57:33.087
So, yeah, Amir had <i>Bachi.</i>

57:37.258 --> 57:41.062
And, yeah, I signed all those
goddamned special visas, okay?

57:41.095 --> 57:42.563
It was part of the deal.

57:42.596 --> 57:45.099
They help us fight the Taliban,
we win the war,

57:46.000 --> 57:47.068
they get a visa.

57:50.671 --> 57:51.772
Jesus Christ.

57:52.472 --> 57:54.942
Yeah. God bless America, huh?

57:59.280 --> 58:00.581
We're gonna hold onto this.

58:02.249 --> 58:03.551
Let's go, Alves.

58:13.227 --> 58:14.729
- Alves...
- I'm on it.

58:14.762 --> 58:16.263
- I'm driving.
- Lou...

58:16.297 --> 58:17.531
I need an address.

58:18.165 --> 58:19.800
I know I'm on leave.

58:19.834 --> 58:22.236
Give me the address
to Hadi Shezad ASAP, Lou.

58:22.269 --> 58:23.270
Yeah.

58:38.152 --> 58:39.754
- Which way to Amir's?
- Turn left.

58:40.588 --> 58:42.590
So you think
Khalid's behind this?

58:42.623 --> 58:44.158
Yeah.

58:44.191 --> 58:46.861
I think Amir made him
into one of his <i>Bachi,</i>

58:46.894 --> 58:48.829
and now he's out for revenge.

58:48.863 --> 58:50.698
What led you to believe that?

58:50.731 --> 58:53.167
The killings,
they were just too personal.

58:53.200 --> 58:56.103
All those markings
that were written in blood,

58:56.137 --> 58:59.673
they were quotes that Khalid
had in his Quran, highlighted.

58:59.707 --> 59:03.210
And he left the town of Darzab
when he was 12 years old.

59:03.244 --> 59:06.047
And did you know that
the missing vecuronium bromide

59:06.080 --> 59:07.648
came from
his family's pharmacy?

59:08.082 --> 59:08.949
No, I didn't.

59:08.983 --> 59:10.718
You mean your partner
didn't tell you?

59:10.751 --> 59:13.721
He went there yesterday
asking about it.

59:13.754 --> 59:15.756
So you think the kid's
gotten to Amir already?

59:16.190 --> 59:18.225
Let's hope so.

59:18.259 --> 59:20.594
Or the other option is,
Amir got to the kid.

59:21.829 --> 59:23.664
Hold on.

59:23.697 --> 59:24.799
Lou, what do you got for me?

59:26.367 --> 59:28.269
Uh-huh? Uh-huh, okay.

59:30.071 --> 59:31.072
Thanks, Lou.

59:31.105 --> 59:33.607
So, Hadi Shezad owns a garage
on Smith Street.

59:34.241 --> 59:35.276
I know it.

59:35.309 --> 59:37.678
What do you know
about Amir, Alves?

59:37.711 --> 59:39.880
Not much. He was stationed
at Clinton for five years

59:39.914 --> 59:42.283
before coming to my squad
back in 2014.

59:42.316 --> 59:44.218
He came to the country
in 2008.

59:45.853 --> 59:48.989
My boy went missing
in fucking 2008.

59:49.023 --> 59:51.792
And year after year,
boys went missing after that.

59:51.826 --> 59:53.627
That's conjecture,
Jimmy. We don't know...

59:53.661 --> 59:55.162
My boy was ten years old, man!

59:55.196 --> 59:56.197
I know!

59:58.132 --> 01:00:00.634
But he could have also been a
model citizen since coming here.

01:00:01.302 --> 01:00:02.603
Turn up ahead.

01:00:03.737 --> 01:00:05.806
Well, we're about to find out.

01:00:35.736 --> 01:00:36.737
Looks like he's not here.

01:00:43.244 --> 01:00:44.278
Let's go, Jimmy.

01:00:56.023 --> 01:00:57.825
God damnit, Jimmy.
What the hell are you doing?

01:00:57.858 --> 01:01:00.060
He's a police officer,
for Christ's sake!

01:01:00.094 --> 01:01:02.029
I gotta know, Alves.
I gotta know!

01:01:04.131 --> 01:01:06.700
Fine. I want nothing to do
with this.

01:01:06.734 --> 01:01:07.735
I'll be waiting by the car.

01:01:08.502 --> 01:01:09.770
Fucking Jimmy!

01:02:40.060 --> 01:02:41.095
Alves!

01:02:41.596 --> 01:02:43.063
Alves!

01:02:44.331 --> 01:02:46.500
- What is it, man?
- It's a boy.

01:02:46.534 --> 01:02:48.369
- He's alive, he's breathing. Call 911.
- Oh, fuck!

01:02:49.537 --> 01:02:51.772
Oh, shit. We need paramedics
right now.

01:02:53.374 --> 01:02:55.109
Where are you going?

01:02:55.142 --> 01:02:56.343
I'm headed to the garage.

01:02:56.377 --> 01:02:59.280
No. I'll call it in.

01:02:59.313 --> 01:03:00.447
I gotta see this through.

01:03:01.549 --> 01:03:03.884
Jimmy, get back here!

01:03:50.598 --> 01:03:51.865
Hadi?

01:04:00.474 --> 01:04:01.509
Hadi?

01:04:11.519 --> 01:04:12.554
Hadi?

01:04:51.258 --> 01:04:52.359
What are you doing?

01:04:59.667 --> 01:05:01.001
Listen, Khalid.

01:05:02.670 --> 01:05:04.171
You don't wanna do this.

01:05:06.541 --> 01:05:07.709
Do you know who I am?

01:05:09.176 --> 01:05:10.377
I'm the police!

01:05:11.513 --> 01:05:12.913
You don't wanna fuck with me.

01:05:21.989 --> 01:05:24.224
Okay. Okay.

01:05:25.192 --> 01:05:26.293
What do you want?

01:05:27.529 --> 01:05:29.196
I can get you
anything you want.

01:05:31.265 --> 01:05:33.400
Money? What is it?

01:05:35.737 --> 01:05:37.471
Can you give me
my parents back?

01:05:38.706 --> 01:05:42.109
Can you take away
what you did to me?

01:05:48.683 --> 01:05:52.687
No, I think I will do to
you as you have done to me.

01:05:54.488 --> 01:05:57.424
You don't have to do this.

01:06:49.844 --> 01:06:51.111
Fuck!

01:06:52.145 --> 01:06:54.749
Shit.

01:07:00.354 --> 01:07:02.322
Fuck!

01:07:06.528 --> 01:07:09.764
You don't have to
do this.

01:07:13.467 --> 01:07:14.536
Fuck!

01:07:18.405 --> 01:07:21.441
I'm gonna fuck you, Khalid.

01:07:21.475 --> 01:07:26.246
Oh, master, you're not behaving
like a good woman.

01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:29.283
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

01:07:31.151 --> 01:07:33.788
I am sorry. I did a bad thing.

01:07:33.821 --> 01:07:36.223
A bad thing?

01:07:36.256 --> 01:07:39.561
How many boys did you take
away from their parents?

01:07:39.594 --> 01:07:41.663
I'm different now.

01:07:41.696 --> 01:07:45.098
How many boys did you make
into your <i>Bacha Bareech?</i>

01:07:45.833 --> 01:07:48.570
I swear, I've repented.

01:07:48.603 --> 01:07:50.203
You have to believe me.

01:07:51.204 --> 01:07:52.674
No, no, I don't.

01:07:52.707 --> 01:07:54.241
I will make sure

01:07:54.274 --> 01:07:56.711
you know the same pain
I endured.

01:07:59.881 --> 01:08:02.850
What...
What are you gonna do?

01:08:07.555 --> 01:08:09.757
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

01:08:09.791 --> 01:08:11.559
- No! What are you gonna do?
- Try not to move.

01:08:11.593 --> 01:08:12.860
- No, no, no, no...
- We don't want you to

01:08:12.894 --> 01:08:14.494
- ...die too quickly.
- I'm sorry! I couldn't help myself.

01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:28.509
- Please. I'm sorry!
- Khalid, stop.

01:08:28.542 --> 01:08:29.743
Put the knife down, now!

01:08:30.612 --> 01:08:32.613
Thank God!

01:08:32.647 --> 01:08:35.148
You have no idea
what he did to me.

01:08:36.618 --> 01:08:38.786
Shoot him. He's sick.

01:08:38.819 --> 01:08:40.487
Khalid, it's over.

01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:43.189
We found the kid
in his house earlier today.

01:08:43.223 --> 01:08:44.692
He's going away
for a very long time.

01:08:48.595 --> 01:08:50.832
You don't understand.
I was ten years old!

01:08:50.865 --> 01:08:53.466
I know, Khalid.
I know the whole sick story.

01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:57.505
You know what he would do after
he's done with his <i>Bacha Bareech?</i>

01:08:57.537 --> 01:08:59.874
He cut their throats!
You understand?

01:09:01.241 --> 01:09:03.176
Shoot him!

01:09:03.210 --> 01:09:06.412
Khalid, stop!

01:09:06.446 --> 01:09:08.716
Freeze, Khalid,
or I will shoot you.

01:09:08.750 --> 01:09:10.417
Don't shoot. Wait, Alves.

01:09:10.450 --> 01:09:13.787
- Alves, don't shoot.
- Help me, Alves, help me!

01:09:13.821 --> 01:09:17.457
Khalid, Khalid,
think about your family, okay?

01:09:17.491 --> 01:09:19.694
They care about you.
They want you home.

01:09:20.828 --> 01:09:22.596
Step away
from him, kid.

01:09:22.630 --> 01:09:25.298
The police are coming.
They're gonna be here any minute.

01:09:27.835 --> 01:09:30.237
It's too late for me.

01:09:30.270 --> 01:09:32.238
It's not too late, okay?
We'll get you help.

01:09:32.272 --> 01:09:33.741
But please, put the knife down.

01:09:33.774 --> 01:09:36.944
You don't know what is it like to
live with this nightmare every night.

01:09:37.511 --> 01:09:39.312
Just put the knife down.

01:09:39.345 --> 01:09:42.582
To relive it
every single night!

01:09:42.617 --> 01:09:46.554
I can still hear
his voice in my ears.

01:09:46.587 --> 01:09:48.890
"Dance for me,
<i>Bacha Bareech,</i> dance!"

01:09:50.424 --> 01:09:52.492
- I have to finish this.
- Khalid.

01:09:52.527 --> 01:09:53.861
Step away, Khalid.

01:09:53.895 --> 01:09:56.263
Alves, stop. Please listen, Khalid.
Listen to me.

01:09:56.296 --> 01:09:57.665
He doesn't wanna go to jail.

01:09:57.699 --> 01:09:59.499
This is what he wants, okay?

01:09:59.534 --> 01:10:01.569
Jimmy,
just get out of the way.

01:10:01.602 --> 01:10:02.737
You want your revenge?

01:10:04.505 --> 01:10:07.608
Then let him rot in a jail
for the rest of his life, okay?

01:10:16.483 --> 01:10:18.853
Johnny was
such a good little bitch.

01:10:25.492 --> 01:10:26.761
What did you just say?

01:10:27.729 --> 01:10:28.963
Jimmy, no.

01:10:30.565 --> 01:10:32.466
Your boy, Johnny.

01:10:33.701 --> 01:10:35.435
But he wouldn't
just stop crying.

01:10:36.537 --> 01:10:40.908
"Daddy! Where is Daddy?"

01:10:40.942 --> 01:10:42.476
What the fuck did you just say?

01:10:42.510 --> 01:10:44.679
Jimmy, no.

01:10:44.712 --> 01:10:46.714
- Jimmy, just leave the room.
- Shut up!

01:10:49.584 --> 01:10:52.687
He was so, so...

01:10:54.756 --> 01:10:56.824
A real good piece of pussy.

01:10:59.894 --> 01:11:01.261
Shut up, Amir!

01:11:02.329 --> 01:11:04.431
Jimmy, no.

01:11:04.464 --> 01:11:06.834
Jimmy, this is exactly what
he wanted. You said so.

01:11:08.069 --> 01:11:10.370
Johnny was my favorite <i>Bachi!</i>

01:11:10.403 --> 01:11:13.406
Fuck you, motherfucker!

01:11:15.475 --> 01:11:17.512
Fuck you! Fuck you!

01:12:22.877 --> 01:12:24.545
D.A. said
he won't prosecute you.

01:12:29.116 --> 01:12:31.118
Forensics found
the bodies of boys

01:12:32.452 --> 01:12:34.055
underneath the foundation
of the house.

01:12:38.659 --> 01:12:39.727
Johnny wasn't there.

01:12:44.765 --> 01:12:45.867
So, it wasn't Amir.

01:12:48.069 --> 01:12:50.838
He came into the country
in January of 2009.

01:12:55.442 --> 01:12:56.711
But he did hurt
a lot of people, so...

01:13:44.558 --> 01:13:46.027
Mr. Baz?

01:13:46.060 --> 01:13:48.162
- Mr. Baz?
- Hey!

01:13:48.195 --> 01:13:50.665
Do you... Do you have a moment?

01:13:52.633 --> 01:13:54.869
- Sure.
- Are you moving?

01:13:54.902 --> 01:13:58.539
Yeah, I think I need
a change of scenery.

01:14:03.210 --> 01:14:04.946
I heard about what happened.

01:14:08.983 --> 01:14:11.118
We are getting Khalid
the help that he needs.

01:14:13.688 --> 01:14:14.755
Glad to hear that.

01:14:18.626 --> 01:14:19.694
Thank you.

01:14:25.166 --> 01:14:26.534
I think I better get going.

01:16:13.849 --> 01:16:18.849
