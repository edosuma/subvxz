00:24.789 --> 00:27.637
Dig, Gene!

00:27.744 --> 00:29.114
Show me the treasure!

00:29.144 --> 00:31.038
Maybe it's some tin foil
and we can recycle it.

00:31.068 --> 00:33.509
Maybe it's a shovel, and I won't
have to dig with my hands.

00:33.682 --> 00:35.351
Look! It's a watch!

00:36.972 --> 00:39.116
Ollie? How long have you
been down there?

00:39.147 --> 00:41.257
Where's Andy?
He was supposed to unbury me.

00:41.288 --> 00:43.481
There you are! I've been
digging all over for you!

00:43.512 --> 00:44.819
Is your brother around?

00:44.850 --> 00:46.318
He's over there
playing with Zeke.

00:46.488 --> 00:48.415
Okay, Jimmy Jr.,
put me in a crotch-lock

00:48.446 --> 00:50.230
and see if I can get out of it.

00:52.539 --> 00:53.833
Zeke.

00:54.003 --> 00:56.109
This is why I'm only
friends with women.

00:56.139 --> 00:58.154
- Pull the key out!
- They're on the wrestling team together.

00:58.184 --> 01:00.465
- Pull the key out!
- I could help you practice, Jimmy Jr.

01:00.495 --> 01:01.652
Tomorrow's good for me.

01:01.822 --> 01:03.786
Thanks, but me and Zeke
are going to watch them

01:03.817 --> 01:06.291
demolish that taffy
factory tomorrow.

01:06.463 --> 01:08.410
We're gonna watch it
get blowed up. Boom!

01:11.477 --> 01:12.550
- Scoop.
- Ow! Ah!

01:12.581 --> 01:13.754
Tina, Gene, let's go.

01:13.785 --> 01:15.176
We've got a whole beach to comb.

01:15.206 --> 01:16.371
- Yes, sir.
- I'm good.

01:16.541 --> 01:18.001
Come on! Hah!

01:18.519 --> 01:21.009
Bobby, want to come over and
watch the game tonight?

01:21.181 --> 01:23.541
I'm making a three-bean salad,
but it's bring your own bean.

01:23.571 --> 01:24.944
Can I put you down for garbanzo?

01:24.974 --> 01:26.489
No.
Nah, he can't.

01:26.659 --> 01:29.025
Bob's got plans tonight.

01:29.055 --> 01:30.898
Yeah, Teddy. Um...

01:30.929 --> 01:33.469
Sunday nights me and Linda have,
uh, you know, an arrangement.

01:33.642 --> 01:34.795
Oh!

01:34.826 --> 01:36.468
Scheduled sex.

01:36.498 --> 01:38.405
Eh... Do you want to
borrow my Sade tape?

01:38.576 --> 01:41.117
Guess what we found
with our metal detector?

01:41.148 --> 01:43.005
Another metal detector!
Yay.

01:43.176 --> 01:45.466
And I found this on the beach.
I think it could help me.

01:45.497 --> 01:48.855
Ooh. Passionfruit paperbacks.
Juicy!

01:49.030 --> 01:50.902
Too bad you kids can't
take the metal detector

01:50.932 --> 01:52.708
over to Caffrey's taffy factory.

01:52.739 --> 01:55.217
Find his secret treasure before
they tear the place down.

01:55.247 --> 01:57.358
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
ho, secret treasure?

01:57.389 --> 01:59.227
What are you, ah...
What are you talking about?

01:59.257 --> 02:00.269
Whoops, there I go again.

02:00.299 --> 02:01.822
Divulging amazing secrets.

02:01.992 --> 02:03.915
Yeah, my Uncle Paddy
told me about it.

02:03.945 --> 02:05.687
He used to work in Caffrey
back in the '50s.

02:05.718 --> 02:07.359
He was his maid.

02:07.390 --> 02:09.734
Your Uncle Paddy was a maid?
All maids were men back then.

02:09.764 --> 02:12.611
Until women joined the workforce
and took all the maid jobs away.

02:12.642 --> 02:14.484
All right, girls!
Go, girls!

02:14.515 --> 02:17.294
A big part of Paddy's job
was dusting Caffrey's money.

02:17.325 --> 02:19.323
Caffrey didn't make his money
from candy, you know.

02:19.354 --> 02:20.354
He was a bootlegger!

02:20.474 --> 02:22.351
I believe the term is
leg-warmer.

02:22.522 --> 02:23.634
No it is not, Gene.

02:23.664 --> 02:25.404
Anyway, Caffrey ran liquor

02:25.575 --> 02:27.297
during Prohibition.

02:27.327 --> 02:28.973
There are tunnels under
the factory where they brought

02:29.003 --> 02:30.441
the booze in with boats
at high tide.

02:30.471 --> 02:31.879
And the tunnels
were booby trapped

02:31.910 --> 02:33.184
to keep out the G-men...

02:33.214 --> 02:35.408
Lousy Feds.

02:35.439 --> 02:37.437
Rumour is Caffrey even
made a bunch of taffy dummies

02:37.468 --> 02:38.786
to guard his operation.

02:38.955 --> 02:40.852
Like the Terra Cotta Warriors
of ancient China.

02:41.130 --> 02:42.600
China. Stick to noodles, right?

02:42.631 --> 02:43.929
- Is that racist?
- Yes.

02:44.098 --> 02:45.767
- A little bit.
- No.

02:45.938 --> 02:47.450
Anyway, Caffrey
didn't trust banks,

02:47.481 --> 02:49.416
so he hid all his gold
down there in the tunnels.

02:49.702 --> 02:51.496
Mm-hmm...

02:51.667 --> 02:54.375
Uncle Paddy told me about it,
and now I'm gonna tell you.

02:54.405 --> 02:56.416
There's a secret elevator
in the factory

02:56.447 --> 02:58.245
that takes you down
to the tunnels underneath.

02:58.275 --> 02:59.775
- Uh-huh. Continue.
- Yep. - Uh...

02:59.945 --> 03:01.698
You follow the tunnel
around the curve

03:01.869 --> 03:04.497
till you get to three stones,
and then you take the tunnel

03:04.670 --> 03:07.549
that bends this way,
and there's the treasure!

03:08.977 --> 03:10.264
It's a butt!

03:10.294 --> 03:11.535
Get it? A butt!

03:11.566 --> 03:13.309
With three turds!

03:13.339 --> 03:15.499
Eh, Paddy got me good with
that one when I was a kid

03:15.530 --> 03:17.473
and now I'm paying it forward.

03:17.504 --> 03:19.462
Eh... Yeah, that's a...
That's a great one, Teddy.

03:19.493 --> 03:21.637
Gold?

03:21.668 --> 03:24.067
He was a funny man,
that Paddy. Eh...

03:24.240 --> 03:25.685
A funny male maid.

03:25.715 --> 03:27.998
With a serious drinking
problem and psoriasis.

03:28.171 --> 03:30.569
Kids-only meeting. Now.
I'll get Mom.

03:30.600 --> 03:32.432
No, Ti-Tina!
Kids!

03:32.603 --> 03:35.804
Listen, let's go get
the taffy factory treasure!

03:35.835 --> 03:37.074
We've got the map!

03:37.243 --> 03:38.514
But it's just a butt!

03:38.545 --> 03:40.022
Teddy was just
messing with our heads.

03:40.052 --> 03:41.255
Men do that.

03:41.425 --> 03:43.598
No, no, this might be real.
Think about it.

03:43.628 --> 03:46.608
If you had the chance to make
a treasure map in a shape...

03:46.639 --> 03:47.862
what shape would you make it?

03:48.032 --> 03:49.719
- Butt. Butt.
- Exactly!

03:49.750 --> 03:51.665
The factory's getting
demolished tomorrow,

03:51.836 --> 03:53.350
so we have to go tonight.

03:53.380 --> 03:55.303
You guys in? We doing this?

03:55.440 --> 03:56.694
I could move some things around.

03:56.724 --> 03:58.659
Let's find butt treasure!

04:00.409 --> 04:02.114
Oh. Well, I am done.

04:02.144 --> 04:03.625
No more chewing for me.

04:03.795 --> 04:05.124
Look at the time.
Yeah!

04:05.155 --> 04:08.034
I'm gonna sleep like a baby.

04:08.065 --> 04:10.147
- A horny baby.
- Ooh.

04:10.319 --> 04:12.780
Ah... Great dinner, Mom.

04:12.952 --> 04:14.440
You outdid yourself.

04:14.470 --> 04:17.384
That was a great day all around.
One for the books.

04:17.415 --> 04:19.123
I want to go to bed immediately

04:19.154 --> 04:21.685
before I spoil it
and make it just a regular day.

04:22.298 --> 04:23.362
That was easy.

04:23.531 --> 04:25.253
That was easy.

04:28.152 --> 04:30.343
Gene, you don't need to do that.

04:30.515 --> 04:33.624
Their door is shut.
I know. My belly itches.

04:33.655 --> 04:35.070
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.

04:35.240 --> 04:37.471
There it is, guys.

04:37.501 --> 04:39.917
Caffrey's treasure
is as good as ours.

04:40.090 --> 04:41.311
And no one knows about it!

04:43.016 --> 04:45.520
What is Jimmy Jr. doing here?

04:45.693 --> 04:47.255
I invited him.
What?!

04:47.286 --> 04:48.861
This book is gonna be
my treasure map

04:48.892 --> 04:50.123
to Jimmy Jr.'s heart.

04:50.293 --> 04:52.296
All I have to do
is act like this damsel.

04:52.467 --> 04:54.761
Hey, Tina. Oh, sorry
I got dirt on your leg.

04:54.933 --> 04:57.437
Oh, my.
H-How will I ever get clean?

04:57.610 --> 04:59.548
- Um, hose it off?
- Yes.

04:59.579 --> 05:01.536
See that fishtail, J-Ju?

05:01.707 --> 05:05.185
Zeke?! Jimmy Jr., you don't just
invite someone without asking!

05:05.216 --> 05:07.626
Yeah! Yeah, we're
in agreement on that, Tina!

05:07.657 --> 05:09.981
Okay, good.
Oh, Tina!

05:10.154 --> 05:12.226
Whoo!
What are we waiting for?

05:12.257 --> 05:14.803
That factory's got windows and
I got a passion for smashin'.

05:14.833 --> 05:15.983
Heeyah!

05:17.359 --> 05:18.959
Anyone else coming?

05:21.945 --> 05:23.868
Just Andy, plus one.
That's Ollie.

05:23.898 --> 05:26.660
We made it!
I got a funcussion!

05:26.691 --> 05:28.032
Ow. Ow. Ow.
Ow. Ow.

05:28.063 --> 05:29.344
That one didn't hurt.

05:29.513 --> 05:30.723
Ow!

05:35.631 --> 05:38.260
Doofus, Brace-face,

05:38.290 --> 05:42.132
Dingle, Berry,
Gas Tank, Blabbermouth.

05:42.309 --> 05:44.181
Just so you know,
we're not sharing the treasure

05:44.211 --> 05:46.445
with you, you, you and you.

05:49.584 --> 05:53.028
Jimmy, the way the moonlight
shines on your hair

05:53.059 --> 05:55.202
makes me feel so...
vulnerable.

05:55.233 --> 05:58.107
Yeah... it makes me
feel like... dancing!

05:58.281 --> 06:00.561
Yeah, J-Ju, faster!

06:01.827 --> 06:03.281
Abandoned warehouse!
Pent-up feelings!

06:03.312 --> 06:05.052
Footloose it!

06:05.222 --> 06:07.350
Don't tell me not to dance, Dad!

06:09.333 --> 06:10.774
We need to find
that secret elevator

06:10.804 --> 06:12.160
and get down to the gold.

06:12.330 --> 06:15.774
I can taste every flavor
from the past 60 years!

06:15.805 --> 06:17.983
I can taste the Korean War!

06:18.014 --> 06:19.220
I taste rust.

06:19.251 --> 06:20.816
I taste Andy's spit!

06:20.986 --> 06:22.655
Come on!

06:22.826 --> 06:23.830
What?

06:26.339 --> 06:27.751
The elevator!

06:27.781 --> 06:29.289
This means Uncle Paddy
was right!

06:29.319 --> 06:31.101
There's treasure down there!

06:31.272 --> 06:32.393
You're welcome.

06:35.124 --> 06:38.086
Tonight's gonna be
a little special.

06:38.117 --> 06:39.859
I got a couple of surprises.

06:39.890 --> 06:42.515
Not Teddy's Sade tape... Dice?

06:42.688 --> 06:44.409
Sexy dice.

06:44.439 --> 06:46.717
We roll them and they
tell us what to do.

06:46.748 --> 06:49.122
Okay. Um, sounds... sexy.

06:49.294 --> 06:53.006
Ooh, let's... "hug".
On the...

06:53.182 --> 06:55.079
"chair."

06:55.110 --> 06:57.689
- So, you're gonna hug on a chair?
- Mm-hmm.

06:57.720 --> 07:01.050
Come. That's, uh...
Come to Momma.

07:01.081 --> 07:02.255
Ahh.
Oh!

07:02.285 --> 07:03.526
Get off.

07:03.556 --> 07:06.068
Um... oh.
Get off.

07:06.099 --> 07:07.474
There we go, that's better.
Whew.

07:07.504 --> 07:08.693
So that's it for that.

07:08.863 --> 07:10.751
So how do we work this thing...?

07:10.782 --> 07:14.082
What's this one do? Ah.

07:14.256 --> 07:16.428
What's happening?
It must be a booby trap!

07:17.769 --> 07:19.147
Pull a different lever!

07:19.178 --> 07:21.027
No rush.

07:22.704 --> 07:25.374
Push the other way!

07:25.547 --> 07:28.050
Nang, nang, nang, nang,
nang, nang, nang, nang...

07:28.223 --> 07:30.303
nang... oh, good ear massage.

07:30.334 --> 07:33.025
Uh. Oh, Bobby.
Aang, nang, nang, nang.

07:33.198 --> 07:34.836
All right, let-let's see
what we got next.

07:34.866 --> 07:36.191
All right?
I'm gonna roll.

07:36.222 --> 07:37.670
Ugh. I got "lick" "foot" again.

07:37.840 --> 07:39.670
- Lick it like you like it.
- No.

07:39.700 --> 07:41.579
- Lick it like you like it.
- No more lick foot.

07:41.609 --> 07:42.869
- Lick it like you like it. Lick...
- No more lick foot.

07:42.900 --> 07:45.022
This little piggy
goes all the way home.

07:45.053 --> 07:46.701
Hey, let's give these dice
a little help.

07:46.872 --> 07:50.145
Let's do this... and this.

07:51.660 --> 07:53.301
That's weird.

07:53.332 --> 07:55.877
Well, it's about to get weirder
with this and this.

07:55.907 --> 07:57.304
No, it's just,
do you hear the kids?

07:57.335 --> 07:59.590
Huh. They're never
this quiet.

07:59.621 --> 08:01.055
I'm gonna go check on them.

08:02.531 --> 08:04.323
Aw!

08:04.354 --> 08:06.989
I knew he didn't take out
the garbage.

08:07.277 --> 08:08.946
Tina.

08:09.117 --> 08:11.662
- Bobby, they're gone!
- What do you mean, "they're gone"?

08:11.834 --> 08:13.272
They're not here.
I got Tina's diary.

08:13.302 --> 08:15.226
Let's see if it says anything.

08:15.325 --> 08:17.319
Dear Diary, tonight
we're sneaking into

08:17.349 --> 08:19.148
the dangerous taffy factory.

08:19.457 --> 08:22.490
Also, if boys had uturses
they'd be called duderuses.

08:22.664 --> 08:24.333
- Duderuses.
- Bob!

08:24.503 --> 08:25.966
They went to the taffy factory!

08:25.996 --> 08:27.171
We got to get them!
Really?

08:27.201 --> 08:28.849
Yes.
All right.

08:29.020 --> 08:32.107
Bringing you guys along
was a big mistake.

08:32.280 --> 08:34.328
Between you inviting
half of the town,

08:34.359 --> 08:36.821
and you pushing and licking
everything in sight

08:36.852 --> 08:38.174
like an animal...

08:38.344 --> 08:41.169
You guys are a burden...
you are dead weight!

08:41.200 --> 08:42.856
What are you doing now, Gene?

08:43.027 --> 08:45.718
I'm being courteous!
I'm using the fart escape.

08:45.749 --> 08:48.134
There's an opening there?
Yeah. But it's full of farts.

08:49.843 --> 08:52.763
I can fit through there
and shimmy down those ropes.

08:52.937 --> 08:55.302
I am ditching you dipsticks.

08:55.333 --> 08:56.741
Wait! We can fit
through there too,

08:56.772 --> 08:58.346
and Ollie can see in the dark.

08:58.377 --> 09:00.387
And Andy knows all the capitals.

09:00.418 --> 09:02.592
Albany, Montgomery,
Juneau, Phoenix,

09:02.764 --> 09:05.502
- Boston, Montpelier, Helena, Boise...
- Brr, it sure is cold in here.

09:05.533 --> 09:08.279
I wish some strong, chivalrous
man would lend me his jacket.

09:08.310 --> 09:10.119
Or pants... Ow.

09:10.290 --> 09:11.771
Wash 'em before you return 'em!

09:19.451 --> 09:20.971
The treasure's in
the crack of the ass,

09:21.126 --> 09:23.672
and it's close.
I can smell it.

09:23.838 --> 09:25.728
Okay, I need one of you
in front of me

09:25.758 --> 09:27.313
and one of you behind me
at all times,

09:27.343 --> 09:29.219
in case there are booby traps.

09:29.386 --> 09:31.848
Booby, booby, booby, booby.
Booby, booby, booby, booby, booby.

09:32.430 --> 09:33.641
Sph! Sph!
Zip it! Zip it!

09:33.807 --> 09:36.811
Oh! Nice try, Caffrey.

09:36.978 --> 09:39.139
Would one of you be a lamb
and pull that string?

09:41.326 --> 09:42.965
Oop.
Oh.

09:42.995 --> 09:44.784
It was nothing.
Was nothing.

09:44.814 --> 09:46.928
Well, that was probably more
menacing back in the day.

09:46.958 --> 09:48.371
This thing's stuck.

09:48.401 --> 09:50.660
What should we do now,
Jimmy Jr? You're smart.

09:50.827 --> 09:53.076
While you guys keep on
blabbity blabbity blabbity

09:53.106 --> 09:54.740
blabbity blabbity,
I'm getting outta here.

09:54.770 --> 09:56.070
Yeah. Yeah. You go.

09:58.863 --> 10:00.338
Come on, J-Ju.
Saddle up!

10:00.504 --> 10:02.604
Okay. I mean, hell yeah!

10:02.634 --> 10:05.124
Let's do it to this!
No!

10:05.154 --> 10:07.710
I... I mean let's all go!
Come on, Gene!

10:07.740 --> 10:09.278
I just got comfortable.

10:09.308 --> 10:11.444
It took me five minutes
to cross my legs.

10:11.474 --> 10:12.602
Now!

10:16.016 --> 10:17.833
Ugh. I'm okay.

10:20.087 --> 10:21.626
He's gone.

10:21.656 --> 10:23.730
I thought Jimmy Jr. and I
would have a romantic night

10:23.760 --> 10:27.034
in the sewer together,
like Fabrizio and Fay.

10:27.201 --> 10:30.269
Tina, honey, it's pretty obvious
Jimmy Jr.'s not into you.

10:30.299 --> 10:32.872
And I'm usually not that good
at picking up on vibes.

10:32.902 --> 10:34.711
Did you know Mom and Dad
were a thing?

10:36.372 --> 10:38.029
Damn it, Ollie!

10:38.059 --> 10:39.134
- I'm Andy.
- Damn it, Andy!

10:39.164 --> 10:41.448
Louise, which way did you go?

10:41.478 --> 10:43.554
- Oh, you can't tell?
- That's too bad!

10:43.720 --> 10:45.286
Don't follow me!

10:45.316 --> 10:47.789
You'd just fall into
every single booby trap

10:47.819 --> 10:50.479
that has ever...

10:50.645 --> 10:53.857
Every single trap
that's ever been what?

10:54.026 --> 10:56.198
Hm. Silent treatment.
Kind of weird

10:56.228 --> 10:58.396
to start in the middle of
a sentence, but whatever.

10:58.695 --> 10:59.781
Oh my God, Bobby,

10:59.948 --> 11:02.639
I hope we find the kids
before they hurt themselves.

11:02.669 --> 11:04.458
Oh, oh. Quit poking me
with that thing.

11:04.488 --> 11:06.026
I'm sorry.
I can't help it.

11:06.056 --> 11:08.129
I don't understand...
why is it still here?

11:08.159 --> 11:10.210
Well...
I may have slipped

11:10.376 --> 11:11.866
a penis pill
into your casserole.

11:11.896 --> 11:13.167
Surprise.

11:13.197 --> 11:14.637
What? Wh-Why?

11:14.667 --> 11:16.805
Sometimes you want to ride
a roller coaster twice

11:16.835 --> 11:18.657
and you don't want
to wait in line.

11:18.687 --> 11:20.321
That's crazy. Where...
where'd you get it?

11:20.351 --> 11:21.311
Ginger.

11:21.341 --> 11:22.979
She does it with Tony
all the time.

11:23.009 --> 11:24.447
I want to be edgy like them.

11:24.477 --> 11:25.849
Pill-popping sex freaks.

11:25.879 --> 11:27.818
Well, what am I supposed
to do with this now?

11:27.848 --> 11:29.987
That thing made the kids;
Maybe it can find them.

11:30.017 --> 11:32.217
- Where are they?
- You know, come on, get out of there.

11:32.275 --> 11:33.789
Come on. Where are they?
Show me, girl.

11:33.819 --> 11:35.310
Wait. Why is
it a girl?

11:35.340 --> 11:37.580
'Cause it's a pretty brunette,
like Catherine Zeta-Jones.

11:38.210 --> 11:40.182
Oh, crap.

11:40.212 --> 11:41.703
Andy! Ollie!

11:41.870 --> 11:42.986
Go get help!

11:43.016 --> 11:44.287
We're on it!

11:44.317 --> 11:46.823
Montgomery, Harrisburg,
Las Vegas!

11:46.853 --> 11:48.127
That's not a capital!

11:48.293 --> 11:49.963
What?
I couldn't hear you.

11:50.130 --> 11:52.049
Las Vegas is not a capital
of Nevada.

11:52.215 --> 11:53.592
I didn't say Las Vegas.

11:53.758 --> 11:55.886
What'd you say?
Oh, just go! Go!

11:57.465 --> 11:59.266
Don't tell anyone.

11:59.432 --> 12:01.239
Okay. Nothing to get
freaked out about.

12:01.269 --> 12:03.075
My arm's not stuck in a crevice,

12:03.105 --> 12:05.473
so I don't need to cut it off
like that impatient idiot.

12:09.776 --> 12:11.718
I just cannot stop

12:11.748 --> 12:13.553
banging things down here.

12:13.583 --> 12:15.706
The acoustics are great.

12:15.736 --> 12:17.619
Tina, what song is this?

12:17.786 --> 12:19.539
"Aqua Boogie" by P-Funk?

12:19.705 --> 12:21.058
Yes! Wow.

12:22.958 --> 12:26.921
Hey. Hey, you. Tough guy!
You want a piece of me?

12:31.705 --> 12:33.476
Sticky.

12:33.506 --> 12:35.478
Are you made of taffy?

12:35.508 --> 12:36.575
Huh.

12:38.746 --> 12:40.521
There you go.

12:40.687 --> 12:42.440
Not so scary, huh, Taff?

12:42.606 --> 12:44.972
Just you and me now...
a girl and her taffy giant.

12:45.002 --> 12:46.611
Classic.

12:46.778 --> 12:48.530
Louise!

12:48.696 --> 12:49.778
Nice echo.

12:49.808 --> 12:51.697
When I say Gene, you say Gene.

12:51.727 --> 12:53.816
Gene! Gene!

12:53.846 --> 12:55.251
Gene?

12:55.281 --> 12:56.919
Ugh. Is that what
my voice sounds like?

12:56.949 --> 12:58.041
Kids, where are you?

12:58.207 --> 12:59.289
We're down here.

12:59.319 --> 13:01.058
How did you find us?

13:01.088 --> 13:02.226
Because...
we're your parents

13:02.256 --> 13:03.660
and we know everything.

13:03.690 --> 13:05.396
Did you read my diary?

13:05.426 --> 13:06.731
Yes.

13:06.761 --> 13:08.133
Are you okay?

13:08.163 --> 13:09.601
Where's Louise?
I don't hear Louise.

13:09.631 --> 13:11.102
We don't know.

13:11.132 --> 13:13.305
She ditched us, and then
she ditched us some more.

13:13.335 --> 13:15.274
It hurt even more
the second time.

13:15.304 --> 13:16.876
Uh, did you take
this elevator down?

13:16.906 --> 13:18.477
Yes, but then we broke it.

13:18.507 --> 13:20.380
Well, we'll just jump
down to the top

13:20.410 --> 13:22.378
and figure it out from there.

13:26.989 --> 13:28.533
We figured it out.

13:28.700 --> 13:29.957
You okay?

13:29.987 --> 13:31.843
How's your penis?
It's okay.

13:31.873 --> 13:34.508
Mine's a nightmare,
if anyone's wondering.

13:37.377 --> 13:40.419
Taff, you're not helping.

13:40.449 --> 13:41.955
Squishy bastard.

13:41.985 --> 13:44.074
Is everyone around me useless?

13:44.104 --> 13:45.754
I have to do everything?

13:47.847 --> 13:49.880
Okay, I see.

13:49.910 --> 13:52.853
Another Taff tantrum,
right on schedule.

13:53.019 --> 13:55.402
Big news... Taff is upset!

13:55.432 --> 13:57.858
Everybody gather round!

13:59.110 --> 14:00.609
Sorry, Taff.

14:00.639 --> 14:01.910
I didn't mean it.

14:01.940 --> 14:04.514
You said things, I said things.

14:04.544 --> 14:06.160
Friends?

14:21.880 --> 14:23.722
Louise!

14:25.599 --> 14:27.239
I can't believe you
snuck out, and I...

14:27.269 --> 14:29.441
I still don't understand
why you guys split up.

14:29.471 --> 14:31.110
She went to find the
treasure by herself

14:31.140 --> 14:32.774
because we're
"a burden."

14:32.940 --> 14:34.901
Gene, what did I tell you
about finger quotes?

14:35.067 --> 14:36.716
Not to "do" them.

14:36.746 --> 14:38.252
But ironic detachment is great.

14:38.282 --> 14:39.907
Nothing means anything!

14:40.073 --> 14:41.305
Hey, up here!

14:41.335 --> 14:42.824
Who the hell is that?

14:42.854 --> 14:44.078
We went to get help.

14:44.244 --> 14:45.844
I got more blood in my head

14:45.874 --> 14:47.579
than a skeeter on a peter.

14:47.609 --> 14:49.668
Oh, my God.
You really do.

14:49.834 --> 14:51.668
All right, hang on a...
I'll get you guys down.

14:51.698 --> 14:53.186
Jimmy, you're looking well.

14:53.216 --> 14:54.591
I've been fine.

14:54.757 --> 14:56.301
Okay, where's Louise?

14:56.467 --> 14:59.262
And that's why I ditched
my brother and sister.

14:59.429 --> 15:02.926
Don't look at me with your
judgemental, hollow eye holes.

15:04.351 --> 15:05.452
What?!

15:05.497 --> 15:07.122
Gene and Tina were a liability.

15:07.317 --> 15:08.752
This is a treasure hunt!

15:08.802 --> 15:10.411
This is a professional
operation!

15:10.464 --> 15:11.931
You would have left them, too.

15:13.419 --> 15:15.456
Well, you weren't there,
were you?

15:15.515 --> 15:17.714
If they're so great, how come
they haven't found me yet?

15:17.775 --> 15:19.061
Huh? Huh? Huh?!

15:19.109 --> 15:20.309
Louise!

15:20.497 --> 15:21.832
Down here!

15:23.380 --> 15:24.604
Don't, don't, don't, don't!

15:24.651 --> 15:26.485
No one likes an I-told-you-so.

15:26.684 --> 15:27.759
Oh, thank God.

15:27.804 --> 15:29.580
We'll get you out, baby!

15:29.777 --> 15:31.178
Are you all right, Louise?

15:31.228 --> 15:32.686
We're fine!
Who's "we"?

15:32.737 --> 15:34.245
Me and Taff!

15:34.297 --> 15:36.139
Let's just call
the fire department, right?

15:36.196 --> 15:37.569
There's no service.

15:37.619 --> 15:39.445
I hate this
freaking phone, Bobby.

15:39.501 --> 15:41.109
Lin, we're underground.
You can't blame the phone.

15:41.162 --> 15:42.938
What, do you work
for the phone company now?

15:42.993 --> 15:44.266
Bob's Phone Company?

15:44.315 --> 15:45.898
What, are you
going to beat me up?

15:46.092 --> 15:47.595
Get me out of here!

15:47.787 --> 15:49.983
- Sorry, Louise.
- Yeah, sorry. I have a cheap phone,

15:50.044 --> 15:52.087
so you're going to have
to stay in there

15:52.146 --> 15:54.946
- for the rest of your life.
- Your mother was arguing about the phone.

15:55.418 --> 15:57.126
Yeah, I did a walk-through.

15:57.322 --> 15:59.325
I did it twice.

15:59.383 --> 16:01.317
We're good.

16:01.517 --> 16:03.178
Get me out of here!

16:03.232 --> 16:04.923
Okay. Louise, calm down.

16:05.119 --> 16:06.681
Listen,
you're not in any danger.

16:08.128 --> 16:09.964
What was that?

16:10.162 --> 16:11.648
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no!

16:13.639 --> 16:15.079
Oh, my God.
Maybe it's an earthquake.

16:15.162 --> 16:17.240
Maybe the neighbours are just
moving furniture around.

16:17.300 --> 16:19.110
We should probably pray.

16:19.165 --> 16:22.066
Uh, dear God, this
is Tina from school.

16:22.282 --> 16:24.076
I just peed Andy's pants.

16:24.132 --> 16:26.358
Warm, warm, warm, cold.

16:30.334 --> 16:32.295
Oh, crap.
They started the demolition!

16:32.495 --> 16:35.200
Hey, so my friend had
a three-bean salad party,

16:35.268 --> 16:36.844
but it was bring your own bean.

16:36.896 --> 16:38.070
Who does that?

16:39.530 --> 16:40.698
Don't worry, Louise!

16:40.885 --> 16:41.965
We're going to get you out!

16:42.114 --> 16:43.624
How are we going to get her out?

16:43.676 --> 16:45.184
Maybe we should smoke her out.

16:45.236 --> 16:46.873
Louise, are you sure
there isn't something

16:46.926 --> 16:48.338
down there you can use
to climb out?

16:48.388 --> 16:49.613
Oh, wait!

16:49.660 --> 16:51.335
Here's a grappling hook!

16:51.389 --> 16:53.690
Oh, and here's an escalator!

16:53.999 --> 16:56.400
- Silly me!
- We're about to die, Louise.

16:56.607 --> 16:58.619
Do you really want
your last words to be sarcastic?

16:58.678 --> 17:00.219
No!

17:00.271 --> 17:02.079
I got it... let's all
spit in the pit.

17:02.135 --> 17:03.643
Then she can swim to safety.

17:03.695 --> 17:05.403
Right, J-Ju?

17:05.458 --> 17:07.675
We're all gonna die!

17:09.998 --> 17:11.166
Stupid book.

17:11.355 --> 17:13.049
I'm sick of acting like a dumb,

17:13.103 --> 17:14.778
helpless girl just so a hot boy

17:14.830 --> 17:16.580
who dances his feelings
will notice me.

17:16.778 --> 17:18.204
That's not who I am.

17:18.255 --> 17:19.964
I'm a smart, strong,
sensual woman.

17:20.018 --> 17:21.209
Oh, God.

17:21.368 --> 17:22.795
Now, here's how
we'll get Louise out.

17:22.825 --> 17:23.825
We'll make a ladder.

17:23.983 --> 17:26.297
Everyone,
lock your arms like this.

17:26.327 --> 17:28.622
The person underneath
puts their legs through,

17:28.652 --> 17:30.969
and you use your core strength
to do the work.

17:31.123 --> 17:33.768
Um, my core
is super ticklish, so...

17:33.798 --> 17:35.614
- I don't know, Tina.
- No, it'll work.

17:35.771 --> 17:38.981
I saw Jimmy Jr. and Zeke
do it in wrestling practice.

17:39.011 --> 17:40.641
Hey, those practices are closed!

17:40.671 --> 17:42.334
I'm aware of that, Zeke.

17:42.364 --> 17:44.206
I'm the reason they're closed.

17:44.362 --> 17:45.688
All right, let's try it.

17:45.718 --> 17:47.902
Louise, grab Gene's hands.

17:48.056 --> 17:49.793
Can't reach them!

17:52.474 --> 17:55.709
Nobody say anything...
Louise looks really different.

17:58.639 --> 17:59.982
What is that?

18:00.012 --> 18:01.243
This is Taff.

18:01.273 --> 18:02.539
He's a booby trap

18:02.569 --> 18:03.849
that became much more than that.

18:04.993 --> 18:07.044
Everybody run!

18:09.307 --> 18:11.055
Why is Taff stuck on Dad?

18:11.085 --> 18:13.188
Well, sometimes, when a man
loves a woman very much...

18:13.218 --> 18:15.869
Oh, crap.

18:15.899 --> 18:17.116
Dead end? Ugh.

18:17.275 --> 18:18.908
If I'm going to die,

18:18.938 --> 18:21.522
I'm going to play "Aqua Boogie"
one last time.

18:21.675 --> 18:23.260
Hiyah!

18:23.417 --> 18:25.050
Gene, not now.

18:25.080 --> 18:27.206
Wait. That sounds hollow.

18:27.361 --> 18:29.655
Hit it again, Gene, harder.

18:31.041 --> 18:32.390
Daylight!

18:32.548 --> 18:33.800
Everybody, through here.

18:37.072 --> 18:38.614
We made it.

18:38.644 --> 18:40.307
We're safe.

18:40.337 --> 18:42.062
Um, lots of people out here.

18:44.834 --> 18:47.538
Whoa. Your sex night took
a weird turn, huh, Bobby?

18:48.803 --> 18:49.986
Daddy!

18:50.016 --> 18:51.530
Andy? Ollie?

18:51.560 --> 18:53.345
Hey, I thought you guys
were with your mother.

18:53.375 --> 18:54.375
You came for us!

18:54.421 --> 18:56.013
I'm just here
to watch the demolition.

18:56.043 --> 18:58.602
You know, I mean, yes,
I came for you.

18:58.632 --> 19:00.800
I'm a great father.

19:02.275 --> 19:03.599
All right,
off, off, off, off, off.

19:03.629 --> 19:04.762
You're wrinkling my belt.

19:04.922 --> 19:06.424
You know what, Tina?

19:06.582 --> 19:08.613
Strong girls are hot.

19:08.643 --> 19:10.273
Put it on a T-shirt, Jimmy Jr.

19:10.303 --> 19:12.028
I don't want to hear it.

19:14.675 --> 19:16.101
Just when I think I'm out,

19:16.131 --> 19:17.755
those cheeks pull me
right back in.

19:18.919 --> 19:20.661
Get off me, you wuss.

19:20.818 --> 19:22.674
Ah, looks like you finally

19:22.704 --> 19:24.437
got the starch out
of your shirt.

19:24.594 --> 19:25.796
Yeah. Finally.

19:25.826 --> 19:27.257
Aw, what a waste.

19:27.287 --> 19:29.215
Well, we'll try it next Sunday.

19:29.245 --> 19:30.544
Please don't drug me again.

19:30.574 --> 19:32.950
We'll see.

19:33.103 --> 19:36.537
Tina, Gene, Taff made me realise

19:36.567 --> 19:38.463
I was a little hard on you two.

19:38.493 --> 19:40.570
I said you were
useless dead weight,

19:40.600 --> 19:42.164
but I was so wrong.

19:42.194 --> 19:44.862
Tina, you got me out
of that booby trap.

19:45.015 --> 19:47.852
And Gene, you actually
banged us to freedom.

19:48.003 --> 19:49.619
I can't take all the credit.

19:49.649 --> 19:51.833
I'd like to thank this brick
and Questlove.

19:51.987 --> 19:53.903
I'm sorry I was mean
to you guys.

19:53.933 --> 19:56.010
Eh, I just figured you
were having female troubles.

19:56.040 --> 19:57.637
What are female troubles?

19:57.667 --> 19:58.983
I love you, too, Louise.

19:59.013 --> 20:00.170
Aw.

20:00.329 --> 20:03.149
And, Taff, what are the words?

20:03.179 --> 20:04.560
I love you.

20:04.590 --> 20:05.981
You're going to live
with me now.

20:06.140 --> 20:07.864
You're not taking that
filthy thing home.

20:07.894 --> 20:09.345
Yeah, you're right.

20:11.867 --> 20:13.870
Well, I guess there
wasn't any treasure.

20:14.026 --> 20:16.480
This butt was just a joke
after all.

20:16.510 --> 20:17.870
Maybe the journey
was the treasure.
