WEBVTT

00:55.097 --> 00:58.183
He spent the carnival trying to win me
one of those giant bears.

00:58.267 --> 01:02.312
{\an8}Spent all his money, has really bad aim.

01:02.396 --> 01:05.691
{\an8}All he ended up with
was this consolation prize.

01:06.692 --> 01:11.113
{\an8}Then I thought to myself,
maybe he's my consolation prize.

01:11.196 --> 01:13.615
I'm moving to New York
for college and dreams,

01:13.699 --> 01:17.411
and he's playing <i>Halo</i>
and contemplating a penis tattoo.

01:17.494 --> 01:20.247
So I just said it.

01:20.330 --> 01:22.291
"Maybe we should break up."

01:22.374 --> 01:25.586
And I was expecting him to say,
"No, I can't live without you, Lucy."

01:25.669 --> 01:28.922
But instead, he said, "Maybe you're right."

01:29.923 --> 01:31.425
And that was it.

01:31.508 --> 01:35.345
Now all I have left of our love is this sad,
second-place duck.

01:35.429 --> 01:37.681
And all his worldly possessions.

01:37.764 --> 01:39.558
Lucy, is this his retainer?

01:39.641 --> 01:42.769
He used to take it out
when we'd make out or have a snack.

01:42.853 --> 01:44.313
My favorite memories.

01:44.396 --> 01:46.565
He needs this. He has a shark mouth.

01:46.648 --> 01:48.317
Don't listen to Amanda.

01:48.400 --> 01:52.446
Your collecting is quirky and adorable.
You're basically an anthropologist.

01:52.529 --> 01:53.989
Correct, Nadine.

01:54.072 --> 01:56.575
I live in a cave of souvenirs,
like <i>The Little Mermaid.</i>

01:56.658 --> 01:59.161
- Nothing wrong with being sentimental.
- Sentimental?

01:59.244 --> 02:03.165
It was sentimental when we were 12.
This is full mental.

02:03.248 --> 02:04.958
A bike tire?

02:05.042 --> 02:07.002
Okay, this is active trash.

02:08.002 --> 02:09.794
What the hell?

02:09.880 --> 02:13.550
- A used condom?
- It's not used. It's in the package.

02:13.634 --> 02:17.387
Gross matches, old... A Monopoly thimble?

02:17.471 --> 02:18.764
That's different.

02:19.765 --> 02:20.974
That's not his.

02:22.059 --> 02:23.101
I'm sorry, Luce.

02:25.646 --> 02:27.731
Okay. Breakup tradition.

02:27.814 --> 02:30.984
Let's wait outside of the liquor store
for someone to buy us a box of wine.

02:31.068 --> 02:33.987
- And then drink it through Twizzlers.
- Yes!

02:34.071 --> 02:35.739
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

02:36.740 --> 02:38.033
Wait, are these his car keys?

02:41.370 --> 02:42.412
Vroom, vroom, bitch.

04:15.339 --> 04:17.507
Lucy, we're leaving.

04:20.052 --> 04:21.678
{\an8}Lucy, let's go!

04:22.679 --> 04:24.223
Lucy!

04:29.937 --> 04:32.272
- Found it.
- What's happening, <i>Grey Gardens?</i>

04:32.356 --> 04:35.150
Guest list for the Meszaros opening
at the gallery tonight.

04:35.234 --> 04:37.986
If I lost this, Eva would skin me alive.

04:38.070 --> 04:41.823
- Okay, she can't possibly be that scary.
- She's terrifying.

04:41.907 --> 04:45.160
Eva Woolf is the most influential gallerist
in New York.

04:45.244 --> 04:48.330
- As your lawyer, I'm saying, calm down.
- Well, you're not a lawyer.

04:48.413 --> 04:49.831
You're in law school.

04:49.915 --> 04:53.377
Whatever. I can still defend myself
when I murder Jeff.

04:53.460 --> 04:55.254
- <i>I love you.</i>
- Maybe one day,

04:55.337 --> 04:57.339
our paths will cross again.

04:57.422 --> 05:02.427
Look at that little baby model.
She has no idea she's an endangered species.

05:02.511 --> 05:05.180
Are you gonna marry Yulia
and get her a green card?

05:05.264 --> 05:09.059
Destiny has other plans for us.
Maybe we'll meet in another life.

05:09.142 --> 05:11.937
- Does she know that? Oh, God.
- That I believe in reincarnation?

05:14.648 --> 05:17.568
- Well, I saw that coming.
- You know what else I love about Max?

05:17.651 --> 05:19.653
Oh, please. We're waiting with bated breath.

05:19.736 --> 05:21.738
Ignore her. She hates joy and confetti.

05:21.822 --> 05:25.534
Nadine, I've said it five times.
Confetti is trash that falls from the sky.

05:25.617 --> 05:29.997
Max is a fully grown man.
I went to his place in the West Village.

05:30.080 --> 05:31.331
What?

05:31.415 --> 05:34.001
And he cooked me dinner
with ingredients he had in the fridge.

05:34.084 --> 05:35.294
- He has a fridge?
- What?

05:35.377 --> 05:37.546
And you know what else he has?
Coffee-table books.

05:37.629 --> 05:39.506
So he has a trust fund.

05:39.590 --> 05:43.051
I can't hear his roommates having sex
through the walls because he has none.

05:43.135 --> 05:46.221
You guys are using those noise-canceling
headphones I got you, right?

05:46.305 --> 05:48.265
They don't work. You are so loud.

05:48.348 --> 05:51.476
- Sorry.
- Just can't believe he chose little old me.

05:51.560 --> 05:54.730
- That literally makes no sense.
- Are you joking? You are a literal goddess.

05:54.813 --> 05:57.858
Are you guys exclusive? Have you discussed?

05:57.941 --> 06:01.653
There's no need. I'm satisfying him
in all areas. What more could he want?

06:01.737 --> 06:02.571
Don't be stupid.

06:02.654 --> 06:04.323
The first time Jeff was ever inside me,

06:04.406 --> 06:07.534
I told him I would castrate him
if he ever spoke to another human woman.

06:08.869 --> 06:10.829
Fine. I'll confirm tonight.

06:10.913 --> 06:13.707
After I impress Eva,
enjoy the open-bar spree,

06:13.790 --> 06:15.167
it'll be the greatest night of my life.

06:15.250 --> 06:18.337
That's what people say in horror movies
before they get herpes and die.

06:18.420 --> 06:20.214
I'm going to work now.

06:21.924 --> 06:23.133
No.

06:24.134 --> 06:26.428
Little souvenir. This was fun.

06:26.512 --> 06:29.681
- Pay up. They're still together.
- Oh, yeah.

06:31.642 --> 06:34.019
Snacks for later. Come find it.

06:35.187 --> 06:37.814
She seems so happy.

07:00.420 --> 07:01.505
What...?

07:01.588 --> 07:03.799
- Excuse me. Can you...?
- Let me in.

07:03.882 --> 07:05.342
What are you doing? Please, don't.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.344
- Hi. For Lucy?
- Why are you getting in? No.

07:07.427 --> 07:09.930
Lyft. Adolfo in a silver Prius.

07:10.013 --> 07:12.641
- I'm not...
- 7023 Decatur. Start the ride.

07:12.724 --> 07:15.435
Really? Are you serious?
This is a private car.

07:15.519 --> 07:17.855
- You're everyone's private driver. Clever.
- No, no, no.

07:17.938 --> 07:21.149
That's Uber. Also not what I'm saying.
Can you please get out of my car?

07:21.233 --> 07:22.401
I selected "no talking."

07:22.484 --> 07:24.653
- Listen, Adolfo, I...
- Adolfo?

07:24.736 --> 07:27.281
- I would love to hear your story.
- Okay.

07:27.364 --> 07:32.494
It's just that I've had the worst night
of my life, and I just wanna go home.

07:34.746 --> 07:36.164
Where are you going?

07:36.248 --> 07:38.208
7023 Decatur.

07:41.336 --> 07:44.256
Do you have an aux cord?
Or just put on Hot 97.

07:44.339 --> 07:47.843
Anyway, how was your night?
Can't be worse than mine.

07:47.926 --> 07:50.888
Do you see this grown-man tie, Adolfo?

07:50.971 --> 07:55.392
Well, this belonged to Max, and it's
practically all I have left of our love

07:55.475 --> 07:59.855
because tonight,
he shook up my life to its very core.

08:00.898 --> 08:03.609
<i>It didn't start this way, Adolfo. Oh, no.</i>

08:03.692 --> 08:09.990
<i>I was happy once.
In love like a big, dumb idiot.</i>

08:11.491 --> 08:13.118
This is my favorite part.

08:13.202 --> 08:15.871
Just before the show
when all the art is hung.

08:15.954 --> 08:18.582
It feels like we're getting
the toy store ready for Christmas.

08:18.665 --> 08:22.085
Cute. But Eva gets back today
and we have a lot to do.

08:22.169 --> 08:24.421
I love her so much, gives me diarrhea.

08:24.505 --> 08:27.132
She discovered Cindy Sherman
in a Laundromat.

08:27.216 --> 08:30.511
Gave Basquiat his first solo show.
I just wanna grow up to be her.

08:30.594 --> 08:32.929
Thrilled that I pay you to socialize.

08:33.013 --> 08:36.433
Max, we are meeting
with Marlene Dumas this afternoon.

08:36.517 --> 08:38.769
Word is, she split with Zwirner.

08:38.852 --> 08:41.313
Strategy session, my office.

08:41.395 --> 08:46.193
Close your mouth, person.
It's unbecoming. Up, up, up.

08:46.276 --> 08:49.154
Oh, wait. Excuse me,
Mr. Sexpot Gallery Director?

08:49.238 --> 08:53.575
Hot tip, Marlene Dumas?
Focus on her riskier works.

08:53.659 --> 08:56.995
I read that she prefers the paintings
that embarrass her.

08:57.079 --> 08:59.289
You are my favorite secret weapon.

08:59.373 --> 09:01.458
God, you make me look good.

09:01.542 --> 09:05.504
- Wait, he actually said those words?
- He was paying me a compliment.

09:05.587 --> 09:09.132
I'm sure the first rule of compliments is,
don't reference yourself in a compliment.

09:12.052 --> 09:16.890
- Don't interrupt. You're derailing my story.
- Oh, sorry. I thought this was my car.

09:16.974 --> 09:20.644
Well, as I was saying,
we were very subtle at work.

09:20.727 --> 09:23.564
- No one suspected a thing.
- What's going on with you and Max?

09:23.647 --> 09:25.941
Can I help you, Harvard?

09:26.024 --> 09:27.484
I may not have feelings,

09:27.568 --> 09:29.903
a love life of my own,
or any friends, for that matter,

09:29.987 --> 09:31.238
but I do have eyes.

09:31.321 --> 09:33.574
Okay, you're loitering.

09:33.657 --> 09:36.285
Junior year,
I took a gender study class at Harvard...

09:36.368 --> 09:37.202
There it is.

09:37.286 --> 09:39.413
...about the social expectations
in a woman's life,

09:39.496 --> 09:43.959
and I think you're unconsciously
subjugating yourself to prop him up.

09:44.042 --> 09:47.296
- <i>Classic overachiever.</i>
- <i>She seems really smart.</i>

09:47.379 --> 09:49.715
So we had this art opening
at the gallery tonight,

09:49.798 --> 09:53.218
which is why I'm an absolute vision.

09:53.302 --> 09:55.429
Thank you.

09:59.683 --> 10:01.226
Again!

10:01.310 --> 10:03.437
You might pace yourself.
This is a work event.

10:03.520 --> 10:06.899
Calm down, Judge Judy.
I am just trying to have fun.

10:06.982 --> 10:10.402
- Do they teach you that at Harvard?
- Yeah. It's a general education course.

10:10.485 --> 10:14.740
- Sounds really fun.
- Wasn't meant to be fun, just educational.

10:14.823 --> 10:16.825
Have you seen Max tonight?

10:18.911 --> 10:21.455
Looks like Dr. Amelia is back from Paris.

10:22.456 --> 10:24.583
What? What are you talking about?

10:25.584 --> 10:27.377
Me? I don't know. I'm not fun.

10:27.461 --> 10:31.632
Sorry I couldn't go to an Ivy.
I couldn't afford to pretend to row crew.

10:31.715 --> 10:33.592
Sue me. Sue me.

10:33.675 --> 10:36.803
Max never uttered a word
about any sexy doctors,

10:36.887 --> 10:40.724
and Harvard's an energy vampire,
so I didn't let her get to me.

10:41.725 --> 10:44.520
- Hello...
- Eva.

10:44.603 --> 10:48.440
- You.
- Hello, goddess, you, also.

10:48.524 --> 10:51.693
I'm not one of those bitches
that doesn't empower women.

10:51.777 --> 10:55.280
- Well, that is... It's great to hear.
- So you're up.

10:55.364 --> 10:56.657
What?

10:56.740 --> 11:00.035
Max is giving remarks.
Get up there. Introduce him.

11:00.118 --> 11:03.455
To be honest, I've had a few tequilas.
I don't think...

11:03.539 --> 11:07.584
I'm not your sorority sister. Just go.

11:07.668 --> 11:11.547
<i>So like any booze bag with a fear
of public speaking, I had more.</i>

11:12.548 --> 11:18.345
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen
and those who do not subscribe

11:18.428 --> 11:21.557
to traditional gender roles
that are a product of patriarchal society.

11:21.640 --> 11:22.808
Am I right?

11:28.355 --> 11:29.523
Sorry.

11:29.606 --> 11:35.988
I am here to introduce Max Vora,
director of Woolf New York.

11:36.071 --> 11:40.367
Max joined Woolf in 2014.

11:43.871 --> 11:44.913
Where was I?

11:52.546 --> 11:54.423
Told you so.

11:54.506 --> 11:56.175
Fuck this. Okay.

11:56.258 --> 11:57.718
Question for the group.

11:57.801 --> 12:02.848
Speaking of the devil here, when did
dating one person become uncool?

12:02.931 --> 12:04.850
Because I don't understand.

12:04.933 --> 12:07.644
Jane Austen,
she didn't write about polyamory.

12:07.728 --> 12:10.772
No, no, no. It was just <i>Emma.</i>
It wasn't <i>Emmas.</i>

12:10.856 --> 12:17.362
Oh, we are living in very muddy times.
People are lying constantly.

12:17.446 --> 12:18.780
- Oh, shit.
- I know.

12:18.864 --> 12:23.202
We only have 10 years before we all drown
in the melting ice caps,

12:23.285 --> 12:27.080
but I swear,
the most sacred resource is not the ozone.

12:27.164 --> 12:28.749
Oh, no. It's honesty.

12:28.832 --> 12:31.418
- Excuse me. Hey. Lucy...
- Where is that? Oh, no, no, no, sir.

12:31.502 --> 12:34.880
You stay back. I'm fine. Yep. That...

12:36.965 --> 12:38.300
Are you...?

12:41.178 --> 12:42.429
Lucy?

12:42.513 --> 12:44.097
Lucy, I know. I know.

12:44.181 --> 12:45.807
- I know.
- Who is she?

12:45.891 --> 12:48.560
It's Amelia. She's my ex. It's complicated.

12:48.644 --> 12:50.896
Okay, Lucy, listen. You're a blast.

12:50.979 --> 12:54.816
I don't even use that word,
but it fits for you. You are so funny.

12:54.900 --> 12:57.236
But we're in completely different places
in our lives.

12:57.319 --> 13:01.782
I'm 35 years old. I need to find that thing.

13:02.783 --> 13:05.869
And that thing is not me?

13:08.497 --> 13:10.249
This sucks.

13:11.250 --> 13:13.669
Eva doesn't want you to come in tomorrow.

13:14.670 --> 13:18.006
Right. That's nice of her.

13:18.090 --> 13:21.718
Personal day would be good.
I'm probably concussed.

13:21.802 --> 13:24.346
Eva doesn't think you should come back...

13:25.347 --> 13:26.974
ever.

13:28.100 --> 13:29.852
I'm fired?

13:31.061 --> 13:34.565
Honestly, I think you're better off
without him.

13:34.648 --> 13:37.276
Came to New York to have my own gallery.

13:37.359 --> 13:40.821
I can't even hold down a job
as a gallery assistant.

13:40.904 --> 13:42.573
I'm doomed.

13:44.950 --> 13:45.909
Hello?

13:46.910 --> 13:49.246
Oh, okay.

13:50.497 --> 13:53.375
I'm sorry, Adolfo.

13:53.458 --> 13:54.918
Yeah. No, I'll cancel.

13:55.919 --> 13:57.421
Okay.

13:59.464 --> 14:01.717
You're not Adolfo? Who are you?

14:01.800 --> 14:03.218
My name is Nick.

14:03.302 --> 14:07.389
What? Nick, you just drove me home?
Are you insane?

14:07.472 --> 14:09.141
What was the plan? You're just gonna...

14:09.224 --> 14:13.687
What? Weaken me with paint fumes
and then just knock me out with lumber?

14:13.770 --> 14:16.690
- Leave me for dead?
- I did you a favor. I, too, had a bad day.

14:16.773 --> 14:18.734
Oh, my God.

14:18.817 --> 14:21.153
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, it's locked.

14:21.236 --> 14:23.405
- No. No.
- Oh, shit. This is the end!

14:23.488 --> 14:26.617
- Can I say something?
- Help! Help!

14:26.700 --> 14:29.578
- Help, please! Oh, my God!
- It's unlocked.

14:32.122 --> 14:34.458
Okay. Good night. Thanks.

14:42.007 --> 14:45.177
- She says, "I don't read books."
- God, Nadine.

14:45.260 --> 14:48.680
- Stop dating the pretty, illiterate ones.
- But they make the best accessories.

14:48.764 --> 14:51.767
Yeah, but a shared value system is the key
to everlasting love.

14:51.850 --> 14:53.727
I hate everyone, and I want them to die.

14:53.810 --> 14:56.813
So does Jeff. That's why
we've been together for six years.

14:56.897 --> 15:00.317
Jeff never speaks.
That's why you've been together.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.819
No, but he comes alive when we make love.

15:12.079 --> 15:14.540
Max broke up with me.

15:15.624 --> 15:16.708
And I'm fired.

15:46.154 --> 15:48.490
I can't believe it's over.

15:48.574 --> 15:50.200
Is that a crab cake?

15:51.201 --> 15:54.079
- It's gonna be okay.
- No, it's not.

15:55.956 --> 15:57.624
<i>That...</i>

15:57.708 --> 16:02.087
Oh, yeah. It's gonna be so great.

16:15.559 --> 16:19.271
I can't live like this.
We're getting smell complaints.

16:19.354 --> 16:21.732
Do you know that place
where you feel nothingness?

16:21.815 --> 16:22.649
No.

16:22.733 --> 16:24.026
- Here.
- My breasts?

16:24.109 --> 16:27.321
No. Underneath your breasts.
It's called your heart.

16:27.404 --> 16:29.448
- Oh, my God.
- This is where people keep their hearts.

16:29.531 --> 16:31.700
Try and be sensitive.

16:31.783 --> 16:33.493
Lucy.

16:34.786 --> 16:37.164
You wanna try getting out of bed today?

16:37.247 --> 16:39.333
- I'm busy.
- Doing what?

16:39.416 --> 16:42.211
This lady's teaching me
to French braid my hair.

16:42.294 --> 16:44.796
It's impossible.
Save yourselves the anguish.

16:44.880 --> 16:48.550
Have you just been masturbating
and braiding your hair for three weeks?

16:48.634 --> 16:52.429
- My vibrator will never break my heart.
- Can we be sex positive?

16:52.513 --> 16:54.556
No one is supposed
to climax that much. Ask Jeff.

16:54.640 --> 16:56.391
Is Jeff in here?

16:56.475 --> 16:58.644
Jeff? Hey! What are you doing?

16:58.727 --> 17:01.855
You can't have a good relationship
because you're mourning the old one.

17:01.939 --> 17:03.524
She's right. You live in the past.

17:03.607 --> 17:08.194
Yeah. It's because the past is filled
with memories and happy times.

17:08.278 --> 17:12.616
How is someone your everything one minute
and then they forget you the next?

17:12.699 --> 17:14.952
Ask Nadine.
She's dumps bitches on the regular.

17:15.035 --> 17:17.496
- This is not about me.
- Nadine.

17:18.497 --> 17:20.499
- Don't do that.
- That's it.

17:20.582 --> 17:22.960
Hey! No! Amanda, stop.

17:23.041 --> 17:24.377
Stop it! Come on.

17:24.461 --> 17:25.752
- No!
- Please, don't. Please.

17:25.838 --> 17:28.590
I need these things. Okay? Trust my process.

17:28.674 --> 17:31.343
We are coming from a good place.
We're worried about you.

17:31.426 --> 17:33.887
- You sit shiva in this room.
- Hovel.

17:33.971 --> 17:36.682
Getting rid of things doesn't mean
getting rid of the memories.

17:36.765 --> 17:39.726
- Marie Kondo says...
- We do not speak of her in this house.

17:39.810 --> 17:42.813
Okay, these things,
they can't just end up in some landfill.

17:42.896 --> 17:44.857
Do these things spark joy?

17:44.940 --> 17:47.067
- Does this spark joy?
- Yes. Clearly. A lot of joy.

17:47.150 --> 17:48.569
- Seriously?
- Yes.

17:48.652 --> 17:51.363
At least get rid of the ex memorabilia.
Give it back to them.

17:52.698 --> 17:55.284
- What? I just call my exes out of the blue?
- Yeah.

17:55.367 --> 17:57.911
- The ex memorial goes today.
- Fine.

17:58.912 --> 18:00.122
Okay, a few things.

18:01.123 --> 18:02.875
Not this.

18:02.958 --> 18:07.004
Yeah, Luce, I don't...
I don't think that I can accept this.

18:07.087 --> 18:10.924
Don't you have a box under your bed where
you keep mementos from past relationships?

18:11.008 --> 18:15.846
Yeah, I do. And I even have,
like, a thing or two from us, but...

18:16.847 --> 18:18.390
What?

18:18.473 --> 18:22.769
Well, like, your collecting is...

18:23.770 --> 18:25.063
It's creepy.

18:25.147 --> 18:29.610
I couldn't be with someone who just needed
to memorialize every second of every day.

18:29.693 --> 18:33.405
And not to mention your room.
I mean, whenever I would stay over...

18:33.488 --> 18:36.074
it was like hooking up in a mausoleum.

18:36.158 --> 18:39.161
- I'm sure that's on someone's bucket list.
- I don't...

18:39.244 --> 18:41.288
We broke up because of my stuff?

18:43.081 --> 18:44.791
Not no.

18:45.792 --> 18:49.755
I think we can take this,
but most of this is crap.

18:49.838 --> 18:53.800
Crap? What? You have a whole shelf
of crap back there.

18:53.884 --> 18:55.260
Those were my mother's.

18:55.344 --> 18:57.346
Oh, so you get it. Right?

18:57.429 --> 19:00.516
- No. Those are collectibles. This is crap.
- This is ridiculous.

19:00.599 --> 19:04.686
Literally, no one understands me,
so I'm just gonna just be on my way.

19:04.770 --> 19:07.314
Okay. Are we done?

19:07.397 --> 19:10.442
No. No, we're not done.
Can I have a job application?

19:10.526 --> 19:14.571
Even after she ghosted me...

19:14.655 --> 19:16.698
I still keep them.

19:18.033 --> 19:21.453
It's contact lenses.
It's pretty gross, actually.

19:31.046 --> 19:32.589
Nick, Marcos.

19:32.673 --> 19:33.924
- Bump up.
- The usual?

19:34.007 --> 19:36.593
- Yeah, make it a triple.
- Shitty day?

19:36.677 --> 19:39.847
Yeah. Eviction notice.

19:39.930 --> 19:43.141
- I wouldn't say terrible.
- We have 30 days to open.

19:43.225 --> 19:45.310
Our entire livelihood is in danger.

19:45.394 --> 19:47.437
I don't know how I'm gonna feed
my pregnant wife,

19:47.521 --> 19:49.773
but other than that, it's pretty good.

19:49.857 --> 19:53.068
Welcome to the hospitality industry.
Basically a slow death.

19:53.151 --> 19:55.737
Are you Asian Gordon Ramsay?
Why would you say that?

19:55.821 --> 19:57.573
- Get out.
- Fine, I will.

19:57.656 --> 20:01.785
I have to explain to my pregnant wife that
we're not gonna have money in two weeks.

20:01.869 --> 20:03.787
- I'm gonna pay you.
- I know you will.

20:03.871 --> 20:05.455
- You complete me.
- Goodbye.

20:05.539 --> 20:06.999
- Bye.
- Bye-bye, little Kimchi Taco.

20:07.082 --> 20:08.166
- Goodbye.
- Later.

20:08.250 --> 20:12.546
Goodbye. Don't touch me.
Where's the nearest bridge? Anybody?

20:18.844 --> 20:22.764
You'll like it here.
Yeah, the chef is supposed to be good.

20:28.187 --> 20:31.857
It's okay. Just gonna have a conversation.

20:32.858 --> 20:34.318
Yeah.

20:35.319 --> 20:36.737
Okay.

20:37.738 --> 20:40.657
You got this. Okay.

20:42.326 --> 20:43.452
Thank you.

20:46.079 --> 20:48.123
Excuse me. Can I help you?

20:48.207 --> 20:52.002
Hey, girl. Cute dress.
I'm just meeting a friend.

20:52.085 --> 20:56.215
- What friend?
- Those ones. Over there. That's my friend.

20:56.298 --> 20:58.467
- Oh, shit.
- That guy just saw you and ducked.

20:58.550 --> 21:00.636
No, no, no. He just dropped his menu.

21:00.719 --> 21:04.640
- I just gotta talk to him for five minutes.
- I'm sorry. I can't let you do that.

21:05.807 --> 21:08.852
Oh, hey, I know that guy. Adolfo-Nick.
What's up, dude?

21:08.936 --> 21:10.687
- Hey.
- Yo. You know her?

21:10.771 --> 21:13.565
- It's a long story.
- Ma'am, I have to ask you to leave.

21:13.649 --> 21:16.235
"Ma'am"? We're the same age. You can relax.

21:16.318 --> 21:18.529
- You're carrying a garbage bag.
- Yeah.

21:18.612 --> 21:23.492
And you tell people where to sit
for a living. And your dress is undone.

21:27.120 --> 21:28.914
Unhandle me! What the...?

21:28.997 --> 21:32.251
- I care for you so much.
- Let go of me!

21:32.334 --> 21:36.338
- Okay. You can let me go.
- That's the craziest thing I've ever seen.

21:36.421 --> 21:39.299
I had it under control until you interfered.

21:39.383 --> 21:42.594
You magically show up everywhere.
Are you my stalker?

21:42.678 --> 21:46.557
I think the words
you're looking for are "thank you."

21:46.640 --> 21:49.560
And then I say, "You're welcome."

21:50.561 --> 21:51.478
I'm Lucy.

21:52.479 --> 21:54.606
Charmed, I'm sure.

21:56.567 --> 21:58.610
You good, Lucy?

21:59.611 --> 22:01.738
- Yeah, yeah. No, I'm okay.
- Okay.

22:01.822 --> 22:03.907
I'm just processing it. Wait. Wait.

22:03.991 --> 22:06.201
Hey, hello. What?

22:06.285 --> 22:09.246
You just manhandled me, and you're gonna
just leave me alone on the street?

22:09.329 --> 22:12.291
Hey! Hey! You hit her? You just hit her?

22:12.374 --> 22:13.417
- No, no, no.
- No.

22:13.500 --> 22:15.210
I see what's going on. You just hit her.

22:15.294 --> 22:17.087
- No.
- Okay. That's cool, man!

22:17.171 --> 22:19.047
- You hit a lady. That's nice.
- No, no, no.

22:19.131 --> 22:20.591
- I didn't hit her.
- This is my fault.

22:20.674 --> 22:21.884
This is not your fault.

22:21.967 --> 22:27.890
Being a woman is like living in a goddamn
nobody-believes-me movie every day, okay?

22:27.973 --> 22:31.310
But today is not that day
because we are gonna fight him.

22:31.393 --> 22:32.686
- Come at me, homey.
- I really...

22:32.769 --> 22:33.729
- Come at me!
- Oh, no.

22:33.812 --> 22:36.523
- Oh, my God. Fuck!
- You come at me!

22:36.607 --> 22:38.233
This is all your fault.

22:38.317 --> 22:40.944
I'm so sorry.
We should get some ice on that.

22:41.028 --> 22:43.030
Here's an idea:
Why don't you leave me alone?

22:43.113 --> 22:46.074
No. Only a terrible person would
leave you alone in your time of need.

22:46.158 --> 22:49.036
Yeah. And I think
you are that terrible person.

22:49.119 --> 22:50.329
No. I'm nice.

22:50.412 --> 22:53.332
If you got to know me,
you'd be obsessed with me.

23:00.422 --> 23:05.135
Oh, great. Okay, the car was just pre-game.
This is where you actually murder me.

23:05.219 --> 23:08.847
- And yet you are still following me.
- What? You're a squatter?

23:08.931 --> 23:10.891
- I guess so.
- Construction worker?

23:10.974 --> 23:12.976
- Sometimes.
- Are we playing 20 questions?

23:13.060 --> 23:14.728
- If you must know...
- I must.

23:14.811 --> 23:17.940
It's an old YMCA,
and I'm turning it into a boutique hotel.

23:18.023 --> 23:20.359
- What? You're serious?
- Yes.

23:20.442 --> 23:22.069
Welcome to the Chloe Hotel.

23:22.152 --> 23:25.989
I'm building a place that feels
like the spots I fell in love with

23:26.073 --> 23:27.407
when I first moved to New York.

23:27.491 --> 23:29.952
Those little places that only exist here.

23:30.035 --> 23:31.578
But I've spent five years,

23:31.662 --> 23:38.001
and, as you can see, every cent
that I have, and it's all falling to shit.

23:38.085 --> 23:40.295
So, what are you gonna do?

23:40.379 --> 23:43.924
Looks like it's coming together.
Is this gonna be the lobby?

23:44.925 --> 23:46.593
Nothing gets by you.

23:47.594 --> 23:49.513
What's gonna happen up there?

23:49.596 --> 23:52.182
That's phase two.
I can't afford to touch it right now.

23:54.893 --> 23:57.604
- Still hurts?
- Yeah. Just a bit.

23:57.688 --> 24:00.607
- Wait. You're doing it wrong. Give it to me.
- How am I doing it wrong?

24:00.691 --> 24:03.026
Can't have ice touching the skin.
You need a middleman.

24:04.820 --> 24:06.488
Okay. Do you want whiskey?

24:06.572 --> 24:08.448
Yes, please.

24:13.078 --> 24:14.955
She really got you good, huh?

24:15.038 --> 24:17.875
Yeah. She sure did.

24:17.958 --> 24:22.504
Here. This will cure what ails you.

24:24.381 --> 24:28.802
Wow, whiskey really is
Mother Nature's painkiller, huh?

24:29.803 --> 24:32.181
What have you got in here, Lucy?

24:33.182 --> 24:34.183
Oh, my God.

24:34.266 --> 24:35.559
An espresso machine?

24:35.642 --> 24:38.020
- Don't go too deep.
- And a sock.

24:38.103 --> 24:39.438
- <i>Cat in the Hat.</i>
- Okay.

24:39.521 --> 24:42.608
- Yep.
- Oh, my God. Are those toenail clippings?

24:42.691 --> 24:45.652
You've seen quite enough, mister. Yeah.

24:45.736 --> 24:47.404
- I'm gonna...
- Oh, my God.

24:47.487 --> 24:51.033
- Thanks for coming.
- I get it. You're a pessimist.

24:52.701 --> 24:55.662
That is the worst thing
anyone has ever said to me.

24:55.746 --> 25:01.251
You collect these things in anticipation
that your relationships are going to end.

25:01.335 --> 25:02.169
- No.
- It's crazy.

25:02.252 --> 25:05.380
No, no, no. You're wrong.
They're a celebration of memories.

25:05.464 --> 25:07.174
- You're a hoarder.
- I'm not a hoarder.

25:07.257 --> 25:10.177
- Hoarder. Hoarder.
- Take it back. I'm not a hoarder. Stop!

25:10.260 --> 25:13.388
You want evidence that your relationships
existed in the first place.

25:14.389 --> 25:17.768
Are you afraid that you won't remember
the guys you dated?

25:19.061 --> 25:21.313
I don't need to explain myself to you.

25:21.396 --> 25:25.609
How about you? You've never collected
anything from a past relationship?

25:25.692 --> 25:27.486
No. I'm a minimalist.

25:27.569 --> 25:30.989
I can fit everything I own
inside a backpack.

25:31.073 --> 25:33.617
When the zombie apocalypse comes, I'm out.

25:33.700 --> 25:36.245
Nice. You're one of those.

25:36.328 --> 25:37.996
Yeah. One of...

25:38.080 --> 25:39.665
- One of what?
- You know.

25:39.748 --> 25:42.125
"I'm a lone wolf. I don't need anybody."

25:42.209 --> 25:44.503
But really you are just scared
of showing your insides.

25:44.586 --> 25:48.090
Yeah. Everyone either leaves,
disappoints or dies.

25:48.173 --> 25:52.344
Okay, Mr. Rogers. Can't wait
for the new show: <i>Uplift the Nation.</i>

25:52.427 --> 25:55.305
So funny. What are you gonna do
with this stuff?

25:56.974 --> 25:58.684
That's a good question.

25:59.685 --> 26:02.813
When love crumbles,
how do you preserve its ruins?

26:04.231 --> 26:07.359
- Why don't you leave it here?
- What? No.

26:07.442 --> 26:08.735
- Come on.
- No, I can't do that.

26:08.819 --> 26:11.280
- Just let go.
- No, no, no. It's okay.

26:11.363 --> 26:13.866
- Sure. It'll be okay.
- Okay.

26:14.867 --> 26:16.410
This...

26:16.493 --> 26:19.997
Oh, look. It's a nail. Perfectly placed.

26:20.998 --> 26:22.833
Would you look at that?

26:27.462 --> 26:29.214
Kind of looks cool.

26:29.298 --> 26:31.383
It's like art in a gallery.

26:31.466 --> 26:33.135
The Sad Gallery.

26:33.218 --> 26:36.763
More like the Broken Heart Gallery.

26:38.307 --> 26:40.058
Do you have a marker?

26:41.059 --> 26:43.854
- What?
- You have a marker, I just...

26:43.937 --> 26:45.230
- No, I don't.
- Come on. Please.

26:45.314 --> 26:47.232
- I have a brilliant idea.
- Why do you want it?

26:47.316 --> 26:50.152
I'm feeling inspired. Let me express.

26:53.238 --> 26:54.740
Think fast.

26:55.741 --> 26:56.992
Nice.

26:57.075 --> 27:00.871
Oh, sure. Draw on the wall.

27:22.851 --> 27:25.812
Thank you for letting me express myself.

27:25.896 --> 27:27.689
You're welcome.

27:30.359 --> 27:33.946
Wait. What's the security like
in this place?

27:34.029 --> 27:35.697
Is there security?

27:35.781 --> 27:38.700
You're worried that someone is gonna
break into my unfinished hotel

27:38.784 --> 27:40.494
and steal your ex-boyfriend's tie?

27:40.577 --> 27:42.788
No. That won't happen, right?

27:42.871 --> 27:45.290
- No, it wouldn't happen.
- No.

27:45.374 --> 27:47.668
No, you're right. I should leave it.

27:47.751 --> 27:49.503
Yeah, I can leave this.

27:49.586 --> 27:53.173
It'll be good. I'm... I'm gonna leave it.

27:53.257 --> 27:55.968
No. I can't, actual... No.

27:56.051 --> 27:58.679
- What? You're looking at me.
- I'm not. What?

27:58.762 --> 28:01.557
- I'm sorry. This just got weird.
- It's okay.

28:01.640 --> 28:06.311
No, I'm... I'm gonna go. But I will... Bye.

28:07.771 --> 28:10.399
- Bye.
- He was my high school sweetheart.

28:10.482 --> 28:13.443
He moved across the country,
and we lost touch.

28:13.527 --> 28:17.281
But smoked too much weed, wouldn't call
you back. He would be a terrible husband.

28:17.364 --> 28:19.616
I make my husband wear it when we ****.

28:20.617 --> 28:22.452
Lucy? Babe?

28:22.536 --> 28:23.579
Are you okay?

28:23.662 --> 28:25.163
Maybe you could try to get a job?

28:25.247 --> 28:26.540
My birthday week is coming up,

28:26.623 --> 28:28.876
and I expect a really thoughtful
and expensive gift.

28:28.959 --> 28:31.879
- There's no birthday week.
- Yes. It's the week of your birthday.

28:31.962 --> 28:33.547
You're not a 16th-century monarch.

28:33.630 --> 28:37.259
You can't command multiple days
for your personal festivities.

28:37.342 --> 28:39.136
Remember our Monopoly tournaments?

28:39.219 --> 28:41.930
Well, I need a Get Out Of Jail Free card.

28:42.931 --> 28:46.685
Anyway, last night, it was rough.

28:47.686 --> 28:49.771
I wish I could talk to you about it.

28:50.772 --> 28:51.607
Bye.

28:53.483 --> 28:55.027
Lucy.

28:56.445 --> 28:57.613
Nick?

28:57.696 --> 28:58.906
Can I come in?

28:59.907 --> 29:04.036
No. No, no, no. Lucy is dead.

29:04.119 --> 29:05.746
How'd she die?

29:05.829 --> 29:08.081
- Decapitated on a roller coaster.
- That's a shame.

29:08.165 --> 29:09.958
She had such a nice head.

29:13.212 --> 29:15.005
And you are not wearing any pants.

29:17.424 --> 29:20.010
Pants. No. Not wearing those.

29:21.970 --> 29:23.555
Shoelaces in a bag?

29:24.556 --> 29:26.266
Go ahead. Judge me.

29:26.350 --> 29:27.976
No judgments.

29:28.060 --> 29:32.481
- Wait. What are you doing here?
- I wanna show you something. Come on.

29:32.564 --> 29:34.900
- How did you get in here?
- Your roommates let me in.

29:34.983 --> 29:37.027
Those bitches.

29:44.451 --> 29:48.664
Okay. So this map was just here
when you showed up this morning?

29:48.747 --> 29:50.791
- Yep.
- Who could have left it?

29:50.874 --> 29:53.877
I know a construction worker,
a delivery guy,

29:53.961 --> 29:56.839
one of your multiple personalities?

29:56.922 --> 29:58.423
This is amazing.

29:58.507 --> 30:03.971
There are broken people out there like me,
people who need to let go and move on.

30:04.054 --> 30:07.182
Good. Well, you can take the stuff
and move on.

30:07.266 --> 30:11.228
There's nowhere else like this.
I wish someone had done this for me.

30:11.311 --> 30:13.897
The Broken Heart Gallery could be
a community service.

30:13.981 --> 30:15.274
No. This is my hotel.

30:15.357 --> 30:19.820
It is not some sort of Lost and Found
for hoarder stalkers.

30:19.903 --> 30:21.947
- Again, not a hoarder.
- Hoarder.

30:22.030 --> 30:23.740
No. We've been through this.

30:23.824 --> 30:26.535
Oh, wow, this is the shrine to exes
you were talking about?

30:26.618 --> 30:27.870
I didn't say... I...

30:27.953 --> 30:29.913
- It's a direct quote.
- I didn't say that.

30:29.997 --> 30:31.707
Lucy, this is my friend Marcos.

30:31.790 --> 30:33.876
Hey. Oh, my God. We're friends now?

30:33.959 --> 30:37.421
That would explain why I'm building
a bar top for you for free.

30:37.504 --> 30:39.923
- Can you not...? Don't listen to him.
- Friendship. Servitude.

30:40.007 --> 30:42.968
I am the godfather to his unborn child.

30:43.051 --> 30:46.221
No, he's lobbying
for the position of godfather.

30:46.305 --> 30:50.058
Plot twist: It's not going well.
If I had to guess, you know?

30:50.142 --> 30:52.603
Would you want this man
to be your spiritual guide?

30:52.686 --> 30:54.980
No. Maybe my TV guide.

30:55.063 --> 30:56.899
- Am I right?
- Terrible dad joke.

30:56.982 --> 30:58.400
I like her. Let's get to work.

30:58.483 --> 30:59.610
- Okay.
- Nice to meet you.

30:59.693 --> 31:02.237
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

31:02.321 --> 31:04.448
I can help. I...

31:05.449 --> 31:08.118
I can help with the hotel
in exchange for gallery space.

31:08.202 --> 31:09.661
- No.
- No, I can help.

31:09.745 --> 31:15.083
I can... I can paint. I can saw.
I can lift and lay tile, grout.

31:15.167 --> 31:16.793
- Is that...? That's a thing.
- Yeah.

31:16.877 --> 31:18.128
It's not gonna happen.

31:18.212 --> 31:22.674
That sounds like free labor,
and, Nick, you love free labor, don't you?

31:22.758 --> 31:23.675
You do. Come on.

31:23.759 --> 31:26.094
- Come on.
- You don't have a plan for the balcony yet.

31:26.178 --> 31:30.057
I did say I had a plan for the balcony.
I said it was phase two.

31:30.140 --> 31:32.601
Sorry, balconies are really important.

31:32.684 --> 31:34.102
- He gets it.
- They're essential.

31:34.186 --> 31:36.522
- What is going on?
- Two people agreeing.

31:36.605 --> 31:39.608
- Maybe eternal friendship. I don't know.
- We're bonding. We're friends?

31:39.691 --> 31:41.485
We should take it step by step, but sure.

31:41.568 --> 31:42.986
- Okay.
- It's a good start.

31:43.070 --> 31:44.988
- I hate both of you.
- Is that a yes?

31:45.072 --> 31:46.573
- No. No.
- Hell, yes.

31:46.657 --> 31:49.660
Of course. We could use the help.
You start tomorrow, 7 in the morning.

31:49.743 --> 31:52.287
Get us the coffee, right?
You know, gotta pay the piper.

31:52.371 --> 31:55.582
We do love oat milk. You can get almond milk
if you don't have it.

31:55.666 --> 32:00.045
Soy milk, whatever. Have fun with it.
But nothing with actual dairy.

32:00.128 --> 32:01.839
He gets really sensitive in his tummy.

32:01.922 --> 32:04.842
- Okay. All right. Let's...
- He has IBS, it's embarrassing.

32:04.925 --> 32:06.343
- IBS is a real thing.
- Stop it.

32:06.426 --> 32:09.721
- Tell me more about his tummy.
- This is not happening. There is no tummy.

32:09.805 --> 32:11.139
Goodbye.

32:11.223 --> 32:13.517
- Dude. What? No.
- We have 30 days. We need help.

32:52.472 --> 32:54.141
This is Morris.

32:54.224 --> 32:56.476
My husband and I got him together.

32:56.560 --> 32:57.895
My husband left.

32:58.896 --> 33:01.190
Morris took it pretty hard.

33:02.191 --> 33:04.568
Yeah, he died immediately.

33:06.111 --> 33:10.991
Let me get this straight. You are collecting
other people's junk in addition to your own?

33:12.409 --> 33:15.370
Oh, shut up, Jeff.
I should text Max about this.

33:15.454 --> 33:17.748
- He likes to be up to date with galleries.
- No.

33:17.831 --> 33:20.167
- Don't do that.
- You're right. I'll slide in the DMs.

33:20.250 --> 33:22.586
- That's more chill.
- You need to get a grip.

33:22.669 --> 33:24.963
He is dating a doctor
with the face of an angel.

33:25.047 --> 33:26.381
You're a monster.

33:26.465 --> 33:29.551
Thank you.
Okay, you need some sexual Listerine.

33:29.635 --> 33:30.969
Jeff agrees.

33:31.053 --> 33:33.847
What about that new guy, Nick?

33:33.931 --> 33:37.935
Last time I slept with someone
I worked with, it ended very badly.

33:38.018 --> 33:40.521
Oh, my God. That is so true, Jeff.
That does sound like progress.

33:40.604 --> 33:41.438
Thank you.

33:41.522 --> 33:44.942
Why don't you invite your "friend" Nick
to my birthday?

33:45.025 --> 33:47.986
I came up with a new theme, murder karaoke.

33:48.070 --> 33:50.072
It combines my favorite things,
murder and karaoke.

33:50.155 --> 33:51.990
- A heavenly combo.
- A perfect combination.

33:52.074 --> 33:54.451
You guys.

33:54.535 --> 33:56.245
I am in love.

33:56.328 --> 33:59.915
Her name is Irina, and she's got
tiny baby bones like a baby chick,

33:59.998 --> 34:03.752
and I just wanna build a nest for her
and chew her food for her and feed her.

34:03.836 --> 34:05.462
Jesus, I give it two weeks.

34:05.546 --> 34:09.007
Do I detect cynicism
from the great believer of love?

34:09.091 --> 34:11.927
She's right. You've banged
more Russian models than a tech billionaire.

34:12.010 --> 34:14.137
- If you were a guy, we would hate you.
- Yeah.

34:14.221 --> 34:15.764
- I don't need this.
- Yes, you do.

34:15.848 --> 34:19.893
- No, I don't. No, I don't. Okay.
- Yes, you do. Eat the pasta.

34:23.355 --> 34:25.774
Hey, Nick, I...

34:26.775 --> 34:29.695
- I can't work anymore this week, dude.
- Why?

34:29.777 --> 34:35.117
Your homeboy's been commissioned to build
a new table for that hotel in Fort Green.

34:35.199 --> 34:37.661
Really? That place is so cheesy.

34:37.744 --> 34:40.956
Oh, my God. How dare I take their money
when you don't like their mason jars.

34:41.039 --> 34:42.708
Look, man, I know...

34:42.791 --> 34:46.043
I know things are tough,
but I have a meeting at the bank on Friday,

34:46.128 --> 34:48.045
and I will get you your money.

34:48.130 --> 34:50.549
- You are first on my list.
- Oh, there's a list?

34:50.632 --> 34:52.759
Can I see the list, or...?

34:52.842 --> 34:55.262
- It's a theoretical list. Nick...
- It's gonna happen.

34:55.344 --> 34:57.472
- Come on.
- I can't keep doing this, man.

34:57.556 --> 35:01.310
I got a family. All right?
I have responsibilities. I'm sorry.

35:02.311 --> 35:04.646
Don't shut off on me. I...

35:04.730 --> 35:06.440
Show me those blushy cheeks.

35:06.523 --> 35:09.401
Oh, my God. I just feel so warm inside
when I see them. Show me...

35:09.484 --> 35:11.695
I'm fine, man. Please, just go, okay?

35:11.778 --> 35:13.363
All right.

35:13.447 --> 35:16.825
Good morning, building buds!
Who's ready to work?

35:16.909 --> 35:18.327
Because I am. Check me out.

35:18.410 --> 35:20.996
Look at this belt,
a practical belt for tools.

35:21.997 --> 35:24.917
- Here is your coffee, Marky Mark.
- All right, Lucy Liu.

35:25.918 --> 35:29.338
- And then, for you, I got the special milks.
- Thank you.

35:30.339 --> 35:31.381
- Dude.
- Sorry.

35:31.465 --> 35:35.469
Her Majesty looks a little upset
this morning, so tread lightly.

35:35.552 --> 35:39.765
Oh, no. We need to talk about our feelings?
Because the CFO has arrived.

35:39.848 --> 35:41.683
Chief Feelings Officer is here.

35:41.767 --> 35:45.145
- Let's hold hands. Okay, bring it in, guys.
- God. Dad jokes. Okay, I'm out.

35:45.229 --> 35:46.355
- See you, dude.
- Bye.

35:48.023 --> 35:49.983
- Who is that?
- Yeah, you're in the right place.

35:51.026 --> 35:52.945
- Hi.
- Hey.

35:53.946 --> 35:57.824
- Are you here for the Broken Heart Gallery?
- Yeah. Is this that heartbreak thing?

35:57.908 --> 36:01.161
Yeah. You're in the right place.
Welcome. I'm Lucy, head curator.

36:01.245 --> 36:02.829
Yeah. Willhelmina.

36:02.913 --> 36:04.915
So how's this whole thing work?

36:04.998 --> 36:07.835
I don't know.
How does this whole thing work?

36:07.918 --> 36:12.214
Well, why don't you we start
by you telling me what you brought and why?

36:12.297 --> 36:16.635
Yeah. Well, met my ex, Gina,
while I was actually...

36:16.718 --> 36:17.803
Oh, wait. Pause.

36:17.886 --> 36:20.097
Do you mind if I record this?

36:20.180 --> 36:22.766
- Just, you know, for our socials.
- Yeah. Sure.

36:22.850 --> 36:24.434
Take a step back against this.

36:24.518 --> 36:26.228
- Right. Here?
- Ooh, that is perfect.

36:26.311 --> 36:27.771
And go.

36:27.855 --> 36:29.356
I was in the hospital.

36:29.439 --> 36:32.192
I was recovering
from a pretty nasty skydiving accident.

36:32.276 --> 36:35.779
She was my nurse
and had a body cast covered all my tats,

36:35.863 --> 36:38.323
so Gina, she drew these ones on for me.

36:38.407 --> 36:40.367
When I could walk, I asked her to marry me.

36:40.450 --> 36:42.536
But then she changed her mind
three weeks later.

36:42.619 --> 36:44.788
- No.
- Damn, Gina.

36:44.872 --> 36:46.373
Anyway, time passed,

36:46.456 --> 36:51.211
but this just sat in the corner
of my bedroom, taunting me.

36:51.295 --> 36:56.758
- How long have you held on to it for?
- Six... Five years. Five years.

36:56.842 --> 37:00.846
Feels good to admit that, you know?
Then I heard about this place, so...

37:00.929 --> 37:03.515
And how exactly did you hear
about this place?

37:03.599 --> 37:06.685
- My masseuse's Instagram.
- And how did your masseuse hear about it?

37:06.768 --> 37:09.688
Don't listen to him.
Are you ready to hand it over?

37:09.771 --> 37:12.399
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm ready.
- Okay.

37:13.400 --> 37:15.152
It has an odor.

37:15.235 --> 37:16.904
Okay.

37:16.987 --> 37:18.363
- You did it.
- I did it.

37:18.447 --> 37:19.740
How does it feel?

37:19.823 --> 37:24.786
This is the first time in, like, five years
that I feel a little lighter.

37:24.870 --> 37:26.330
- Really?
- Yeah.

37:26.413 --> 37:29.208
That's amazing. Thank you.

37:29.291 --> 37:32.628
If you ever wanna see this again,
you can visit any time.

37:32.711 --> 37:34.713
- It'll be in my care, right here.
- Okay.

37:34.796 --> 37:37.716
Or, perhaps, at another location.

37:37.799 --> 37:40.385
No, definitely at this location.
Don't worry about him.

37:40.469 --> 37:43.388
- Who is he?
- Just one last thing.

37:43.472 --> 37:46.058
We just ask for a small donation.

37:46.141 --> 37:48.519
- Just to keep the gallery going.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

37:48.602 --> 37:51.772
There you go. It's only 5 bucks.
It's all I have.

37:51.855 --> 37:53.357
- Perfect.
- All right.

37:53.440 --> 37:55.067
Thank you so much.

37:57.194 --> 37:58.654
We're in business, baby.

37:58.737 --> 38:02.366
And Bonus Jonas, I'm making you clams.

38:03.992 --> 38:05.994
I'm going to take this.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.210
Thing about breakups is,

38:13.293 --> 38:15.963
someone can ruin your life
just by disappearing, you know?

38:16.046 --> 38:19.174
And then you hang on to the hope
that they'll barrel through your door

38:19.258 --> 38:22.761
full of believable explanations
as to why they didn't actually ghost you,

38:22.845 --> 38:25.806
or lose your number,
or just stop loving you.

38:25.889 --> 38:29.810
So what my ex left was a jar
of organic Choconut.

38:29.893 --> 38:33.272
So, heartbroken,
I would spoon it little by little

38:33.355 --> 38:36.650
while listening to Michael Bolton's
"When I'm Back On My Feet Again."

38:36.733 --> 38:38.235
It's rancid now.

38:38.318 --> 38:41.530
Kind of like my ex-girlfriend's soul.
I hate you. Just kidding.

38:41.613 --> 38:42.739
I hope you die.

38:42.823 --> 38:44.032
How do you get over someone?

38:44.116 --> 38:46.869
You just press some button on your body
and morph into a cyborg?

38:46.952 --> 38:50.163
Just keep going.
Don't look back, don't dwell on anything.

38:50.247 --> 38:52.291
Okay, so you just bottle everything up

38:52.374 --> 38:55.294
until you implode
in a fiery act of self-destruction?

38:55.377 --> 38:58.422
No. I manage my expectations.

39:04.845 --> 39:06.263
Marcos took another job.

39:06.346 --> 39:09.308
Our interior designer quit last week,
but I'm fine.

39:09.391 --> 39:10.893
I'm not upset. Why?

39:10.976 --> 39:15.355
Because I saw it coming a mile away
and I managed my expectations.

39:15.439 --> 39:20.152
Okay, so you don't ask anything of anyone,
which is why you're not asking me right now.

39:21.153 --> 39:24.239
- Asking you what?
- I'll be your interior designer.

39:24.323 --> 39:25.574
- Come on!
- Good God.

39:25.657 --> 39:28.785
Designer is just a fancy word for curator.
Or it's the other way around.

39:28.869 --> 39:31.788
I don't know, but regardless,
there's cool stuff all around us.

39:31.872 --> 39:33.790
You just need someone
to help you look for it.

39:33.874 --> 39:37.336
<i>Okay, but cool stuff means expensive,
and I'm pretty much broke.</i>

39:37.419 --> 39:41.340
<i>The key to collecting is seeing value
where others usually don't.</i>

39:41.423 --> 39:44.051
<i>You know, one lady's trash is
another lady's treasure.</i>

39:44.134 --> 39:45.552
<i>Kind of like relationships.</i>

39:45.636 --> 39:48.388
<i>And where might one find these treasures?</i>

39:48.472 --> 39:49.723
<i>Well, it is moving day.</i>

39:49.806 --> 39:51.975
First day of the month,
leases start and end,

39:52.059 --> 39:55.646
so New Yorkers are leaving pure gold
out on these streets.

39:55.729 --> 39:58.524
She's cute, she's charming,
she's calling my name.

39:58.607 --> 40:02.402
- She looks like rats live inside of her.
- Then she's habitable.

40:02.486 --> 40:06.073
Lucy, it's 40 blocks to the Chloe.
We are... We're not walking.

40:07.074 --> 40:09.660
Welcome to the nonviolent firearms show.

40:09.743 --> 40:10.661
Oh, my God.

40:10.744 --> 40:13.747
How do I seem to find myself
in this predicament?

40:18.293 --> 40:20.838
I'm tired. Can we take a break?

40:20.921 --> 40:23.131
Absolutely not. This was your idea.

40:23.215 --> 40:26.343
Fine, but can you distract me?
Tell me your life story.

40:26.426 --> 40:28.428
- My life story?
- Yeah.

40:28.512 --> 40:30.180
But my life hasn't even happened yet.

40:30.264 --> 40:33.141
Don't you ever think about
what you're gonna tell your biographer?

40:34.142 --> 40:37.563
- Is that something you think about?
- All the time. It'll begin as such:

40:37.646 --> 40:39.815
"It all started
on a sticky August afternoon."

40:39.898 --> 40:42.693
Oh, my God. Lucy, stop. Stop it.

40:42.776 --> 40:45.654
Okay. Your life story. Go.

40:46.655 --> 40:48.740
- Really?
- Yes.

40:50.450 --> 40:54.329
My parents really never settled down.
We moved a ton.

40:54.413 --> 40:56.081
That must have been hard.

40:56.164 --> 40:59.168
Think it make... Made me independent.

40:59.251 --> 41:01.712
So where would you go on holidays?

41:01.795 --> 41:03.422
Grandma's house.

41:04.423 --> 41:06.258
Tell me more about G-Ma.

41:06.341 --> 41:11.013
Well, she lived in this little place
called Kenosha, which is in Wisconsin.

41:11.096 --> 41:13.056
She looked like a Keebler elf.

41:13.140 --> 41:17.978
My grandma loved two things,
football and boxing.

41:18.061 --> 41:20.355
- She chewed tobacco till she was 90.
- Nice.

41:20.439 --> 41:23.108
And I always thought
she was this sweet old grandma,

41:23.192 --> 41:26.111
but it turns out
she was a bookie her entire life.

41:26.195 --> 41:29.323
- Okay, Grandma.
- I know. What a badass!

41:29.406 --> 41:33.076
After she died, they found
a wad of cash under her mattress.

41:34.077 --> 41:35.579
And she left it for me.

41:35.662 --> 41:38.624
- So that's what you used to start the Chloe.
- Yeah.

41:38.707 --> 41:41.627
And then you named it after her?
That's such a sweet tribute.

41:41.710 --> 41:44.588
- I didn't actually...
- Ice cream!

41:47.549 --> 41:48.926
Hey!

41:56.433 --> 41:59.520
<i>You know, we still haven't been
to the coolest little shop in Brooklyn.</i>

41:59.603 --> 42:02.147
<i>Only real insiders know about it.</i>

42:03.315 --> 42:05.484
<i>And what about you? Why New York?</i>

42:05.567 --> 42:07.319
I followed a man.

42:07.402 --> 42:09.780
Did the man know you were following him?

42:09.863 --> 42:13.617
He did when I snuck into his apartment,
impaled him with an ice pick

42:13.700 --> 42:15.786
and feasted on his remains.

42:15.869 --> 42:17.287
Frightening.

42:17.371 --> 42:19.790
But what's the real reason?

42:23.043 --> 42:27.589
Well, growing up, my mom was
an art history professor at Bard.

42:27.673 --> 42:30.342
So it was winter like 90 months of the year.

42:30.425 --> 42:34.012
So every weekend,
she'd take me to the Hessel Museum.

42:34.096 --> 42:40.310
And she taught me
that art tells stories about people, places,

42:40.394 --> 42:43.105
movements, moments in time.

42:45.190 --> 42:50.112
The coolest thing about my mom is,
she really sees art...

42:50.195 --> 42:53.031
in everything.

42:53.115 --> 42:55.033
Like, anywhere.

42:59.496 --> 43:02.249
What city has more art than New York?

43:07.546 --> 43:12.217
You know, I think this project is really
having a positive impact on me.

43:12.301 --> 43:14.595
I woke up this morning,
my pillow was totally dry.

43:14.678 --> 43:17.097
And then feel my bag. It's so light.

43:17.181 --> 43:21.018
I am growing too.
I have not called you a hoarder today.

43:21.101 --> 43:22.311
Typical man.

43:22.394 --> 43:24.980
Proud of himself for something
that isn't an achievement.

43:25.063 --> 43:27.774
Okay. Good talk. I'm gonna go get a coffee.

43:27.858 --> 43:29.318
Do you want anything?

43:29.401 --> 43:32.154
No, I quit coffee.
Only water or booze for this temple.

43:32.237 --> 43:33.989
I'm Paleo.

43:34.072 --> 43:38.493
- I'm not sure that's what Paleo means.
- No, no. It has to do with nuts.

43:38.577 --> 43:41.663
- Okay. I'm gonna go.
- Okay.

43:44.583 --> 43:46.084
- Hi there.
- Hi.

43:46.168 --> 43:49.630
I'm here for the 72-inch television.

43:49.713 --> 43:53.133
You guys are like
the last book shop on earth, huh?

43:53.217 --> 43:55.135
We're the real deal.
It was my grandfather's.

43:55.219 --> 43:58.931
Oh, okay. Well, I was about
to say something that...

43:59.014 --> 44:01.725
It wouldn't have gone well.
Anyway, thank you so much.

44:01.808 --> 44:04.144
- Have a great day.
- All right.

44:05.145 --> 44:09.566
- Oh, hey! Your case.
- I got it. I know him.

44:22.287 --> 44:24.081
Excuse me. Do you mind?

44:24.164 --> 44:26.750
Move! Oh, my God! Move.

44:27.751 --> 44:31.421
Excuse me. Do you have a moment
for Planned Parenthood? Okay.

44:31.505 --> 44:33.882
Excuse me. Do you have a moment
for Planned Parenthood?

44:33.966 --> 44:35.634
- Yes.
- Thanks.

44:35.717 --> 44:37.511
I gotta go.

44:37.594 --> 44:39.596
Do you have a moment for Planned Parenthood?

44:39.680 --> 44:42.307
Oh, you don't care
about reproductive rights?

44:46.562 --> 44:47.980
It's a first edition.

44:48.063 --> 44:50.399
- No.
- Yeah.

44:50.482 --> 44:52.067
Lucy!

44:54.152 --> 44:55.404
Max!

44:55.487 --> 44:57.155
Hi! Oh, my God.

44:57.239 --> 44:59.491
This is so random.

45:01.118 --> 45:01.952
Hi.

45:04.621 --> 45:05.998
- French.
- Oh, sorry.

45:06.081 --> 45:10.043
I just got back from Paris,
so still in there.

45:10.127 --> 45:12.754
- Right.
- This is Amelia.

45:12.838 --> 45:16.717
You saw her the night that...

45:16.800 --> 45:19.303
Are you okay? I'm a doctor, so...

45:19.386 --> 45:21.930
Me? Me? Me good. Me... I'm great.

45:22.014 --> 45:24.683
Because last time... You know.

45:26.435 --> 45:28.437
Right. That night. Oh, my God.

45:28.520 --> 45:29.646
That was such a fun night.

45:29.730 --> 45:32.858
I was just really living my truth
and, like, enjoying myself.

45:32.941 --> 45:34.318
I'm in my mid-20s.

45:34.401 --> 45:36.278
You know, I barely even wash my face.

45:36.361 --> 45:39.198
And sometimes I moisturize, if I feel fancy.

45:39.281 --> 45:42.117
But I just have the collagen
ready to go. I'm 26, so...

45:42.201 --> 45:44.328
Lucy! Hi.

45:44.411 --> 45:46.413
There you are.

45:47.456 --> 45:49.416
Got the flat white for you.

45:50.459 --> 45:53.629
- I...
- Yeah. I'm her assistant, Nick.

45:53.712 --> 45:55.881
- Hey. I'm Max.
- Hi.

45:55.964 --> 45:59.510
This one really knows
how to treat her staff, you know?

45:59.593 --> 46:01.720
- Staff?
- She didn't tell you?

46:01.803 --> 46:04.681
Lucy started her own gallery.

46:04.765 --> 46:08.185
Yeah. Big deal. I mean,
it's still underground, but it's gonna be...

46:09.186 --> 46:12.481
It's gonna blow up. Big. Big time.
Blowing. Lots of blowing up.

46:12.564 --> 46:14.274
That's...

46:14.358 --> 46:16.109
That's exceptional.

46:16.193 --> 46:18.862
Where is it? I'd love to come visit.

46:18.946 --> 46:22.533
And we would also love you
to come visit sometime,

46:22.616 --> 46:25.160
but we are late
for that meeting with that...

46:25.244 --> 46:28.747
- Meeting. Larry.
- Larry! Larry.

46:28.830 --> 46:30.249
Gagosian?

46:30.332 --> 46:31.333
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

46:31.416 --> 46:33.544
He's like a...
How did you describe him? Like a...

46:33.627 --> 46:36.004
Oh, he's like a post-modern teddy bear.

46:36.088 --> 46:38.257
- Just the sweetest guy.
- Yeah.

46:38.340 --> 46:39.550
You know?

46:39.633 --> 46:41.677
- Oh, yeah.
- Never met him.

46:41.760 --> 46:43.929
- We have to...
- Yeah, he hates it when we're late.

46:44.012 --> 46:45.389
- We should really run.
- He does.

46:45.472 --> 46:47.599
- But great to see you.
- Nice to meet you.

46:49.226 --> 46:51.353
Gagosian? Okay.

46:51.436 --> 46:53.063
Shit.

46:54.690 --> 46:56.900
He's just moved on. It's...

46:56.984 --> 46:59.528
Why is it so hard for me
and so easy for him?

46:59.611 --> 47:03.240
- Am I that forgettable?
- Are you kidding me? Max aches for you.

47:03.323 --> 47:07.327
He said so himself.
You're the wild card, the fun, the sparkle.

47:07.411 --> 47:11.248
- You think so?
- I... He thinks so.

47:11.331 --> 47:13.000
- Yes.
- Right.

47:14.001 --> 47:17.045
- Come on. Let's go in here.
- Okay.

47:18.046 --> 47:20.799
Do you think Max
and the doctor have moved in together?

47:20.883 --> 47:24.553
No. No, Max likes his personal space, so...

47:25.554 --> 47:28.974
She probably has an amazing
but crazy skin care routine.

47:29.975 --> 47:31.935
What if he likes it?

47:33.228 --> 47:34.813
Wait, where are we?

47:34.897 --> 47:37.441
Great, is this the third attempt at murder?

47:37.524 --> 47:40.944
Can we get it over and done with, please?
Just put me out of my misery.

47:41.028 --> 47:43.530
Hey, Yan. Do your thing.

47:53.874 --> 47:57.544
- What?
- I'll never tire of that reaction.

47:57.628 --> 48:00.464
- Yan.
- Hey, man. How's the hotel going?

48:00.547 --> 48:02.132
Excellent.

48:02.216 --> 48:04.635
Don't listen to her.
She's a glass-half-full kind of gal.

48:04.718 --> 48:08.847
You're right, yeah.
It's better to be a brooding cynic.

48:08.931 --> 48:11.475
Can you please go get my sign?

48:12.518 --> 48:14.561
So he just makes anything in neon?

48:14.645 --> 48:16.605
Yeah, including a blinking sign
over your head

48:16.688 --> 48:19.149
that says "Keep Back 200 Feet."

48:19.233 --> 48:23.737
Check this out. It's gonna look great
hanging in the lobby of the Chloe.

48:24.988 --> 48:29.910
It's Latin for "Into the middle of things."
It's what the hotel stands for.

48:29.993 --> 48:34.665
It's a place where people will meet
and intersect in our story.

48:35.749 --> 48:39.336
The Chloe will always be a place
they stopped along the way.

48:40.337 --> 48:43.507
See? I have feelings.

49:13.412 --> 49:16.665
Remember when I drove my car
into a parked school bus?

49:16.748 --> 49:19.835
Well, I'm not the mess you once knew.

49:19.918 --> 49:22.171
I have my shit together.

49:22.254 --> 49:23.630
Promise.

49:24.631 --> 49:27.801
- Hey. Who was that?
- No one.

49:27.885 --> 49:31.555
Oh, hello, fancy pants.
Where are you off to?

49:31.638 --> 49:34.391
Well, we are going to the bank.

49:34.474 --> 49:37.769
I have that meeting, and I am terrified.

49:37.853 --> 49:39.938
This is it. Make or break, right?

49:40.022 --> 49:43.567
- I'm coming along to play the race card.
- I think it'll be very effective.

49:43.650 --> 49:45.277
- Thank you.
- Look on the bright side.

49:45.360 --> 49:48.322
The gallery is bringing in
a bunch of revenue.

49:48.405 --> 49:51.867
No. I'm cautiously optimistic
in a very negative way.

49:51.950 --> 49:54.328
- I've lost all hope.
- But we should probably...

49:54.411 --> 49:56.330
Wait, wait. Before you go, take a seat.

49:56.413 --> 49:58.248
- I want you to listen to this.
- We're...

49:58.332 --> 50:01.251
No, come on. It'll just take a minute.
It'll be good for you.

50:01.335 --> 50:03.003
I need to share.

50:04.004 --> 50:06.131
"Dwayne and I met on New Year's Eve.

50:06.215 --> 50:07.966
We stole this bottle of champagne

50:08.050 --> 50:10.344
and resolved to drink it together
the next year.

50:10.427 --> 50:13.805
But Dwayne got sick
and next year never came.

50:13.889 --> 50:16.099
Lately, I've found myself drinking alone,

50:16.183 --> 50:20.229
but this is the one bottle
I can't bring myself to open."

50:20.312 --> 50:23.148
Nope. Nope!

50:24.900 --> 50:27.444
- Nick, are you crying?
- Why...?

50:27.528 --> 50:29.154
No. Why would I...? What?

50:29.238 --> 50:31.323
Why wouldn't you cry? Dwayne is dead, dude.

50:31.406 --> 50:34.159
They're about to drink a bottle together
and now he's a ghost.

50:34.243 --> 50:37.412
He didn't ghost him. He's an actual ghost.
Why would you do that to us?

50:37.496 --> 50:40.249
We said we're about to blackmail a man
into giving us money.

50:40.332 --> 50:42.543
I don't know. Crying's my favorite activity.

50:42.626 --> 50:44.628
- It's true. She's very good at it.
- Thank you.

50:44.711 --> 50:48.757
Last weekend we got together, and we just
re-enacted scenes from <i>The Notebook.</i>

50:48.841 --> 50:50.801
- I wrote you every day.
- Every day?

50:50.884 --> 50:53.804
- I wrote you every day!
- I never stopped thinking...

50:53.887 --> 50:58.934
As much as I admire this budding friendship,
we have to go because we are running late.

50:59.017 --> 51:00.394
Sure.

51:00.477 --> 51:02.354
- Upper hands. Okay.
- Marcos, let's go.

51:02.437 --> 51:04.857
- You got this. Good luck.
- I'm okay.

51:04.940 --> 51:08.151
April, 2006. Maxwell Desmond's bar mitzvah.

51:08.235 --> 51:11.238
So I show up and I do my best move for him.

51:12.239 --> 51:13.115
He was just kidding.

51:13.198 --> 51:16.159
He actually had gotten
an over-the-pants handy

51:16.243 --> 51:17.828
from Jenny Gluck that night.

51:18.829 --> 51:24.376
So I've kept this yarmulke
as a reminder that men can hurt you.

51:53.197 --> 51:54.448
"You're not a hoarder."

51:54.531 --> 51:57.618
"Thank you for saying that.
I do really appreciate that."

51:58.619 --> 52:00.621
"You hair looks great." "Yours does."

52:00.704 --> 52:02.456
"Thanking you..."

52:02.539 --> 52:05.334
Hi. Gallery donation?

52:05.417 --> 52:07.419
- Is Nick here?
- No.

52:07.503 --> 52:09.880
Just me. Us.

52:11.256 --> 52:12.090
Cool.

52:13.091 --> 52:16.094
Do you want me to tell him you stopped by?
Leave a message?

52:17.304 --> 52:18.180
No.

52:19.181 --> 52:20.724
Okay.

52:24.269 --> 52:26.104
See you later.

52:28.649 --> 52:31.026
"She kind of seemed like a bitch."

52:31.109 --> 52:33.820
"Stop. You can't say that. Go.

52:34.821 --> 52:36.448
No.

52:37.491 --> 52:39.910
No! Think about what you said."

53:09.690 --> 53:12.401
That was sweet but psycho.
Next up, we got Ben.

53:12.484 --> 53:14.528
"I Wanna Know What Love Is."

53:14.611 --> 53:17.865
Hi, thank you, guys,
so much for coming to my... Jeff.

53:17.948 --> 53:20.033
For coming to my birthday.

53:20.117 --> 53:22.452
I know this is a really important day
for all of us,

53:22.536 --> 53:25.289
and, you know,
as I was reflecting on my last 27 years,

53:25.372 --> 53:27.332
I was kind of thinking ahead to my death.

53:27.416 --> 53:28.959
- What is happening?
- Eyes up.

53:29.042 --> 53:32.546
And I was thinking that at my funeral,
I wanna be taxidermied

53:32.629 --> 53:35.424
and I want a photo booth
so people can come and take photos of me.

53:35.507 --> 53:38.177
And I'll have wine and hats
and different things.

53:38.260 --> 53:40.429
- What do you guys think of that?
- Inspired!

53:40.512 --> 53:43.473
- Happy birthday, Amanda!
- Happy birthday, Amanda.

53:43.557 --> 53:45.559
- How's it going?
- Hi!

53:45.642 --> 53:48.520
- I picked up your dead man cake...
- Oh, my God, thank you.

53:48.604 --> 53:50.105
...that you asked a stranger to get for you.

53:50.189 --> 53:52.816
This is my wife Randy
and that's my baby inside of her.

53:52.900 --> 53:55.569
Oh, my God, tell us everything
about being pregnant.

53:55.652 --> 53:58.113
Pretty terrible so far.

53:58.197 --> 54:01.533
Well, the making of it was fun,
the creating it.

54:01.617 --> 54:02.910
I'll shut up.

54:15.130 --> 54:17.799
I wanna murder your face!

54:17.883 --> 54:19.009
I love you!

54:19.092 --> 54:21.845
I wanna push you down the stairs,
I love you so much.

54:21.929 --> 54:23.597
Do you ever worry about Jeff's safety?

54:23.680 --> 54:25.933
Oh, he's a dead man,
but it is the rule of friendship

54:26.016 --> 54:30.187
you can't really testify
against your friends, so I know nothing.

54:30.270 --> 54:33.565
- Totally.
- Hey, I have something to show you.

54:34.942 --> 54:37.861
{\an8}- We're in <i>New York Magazine,</i> baby!
- Oh, my God. What?

54:37.945 --> 54:39.571
{\an8}- I know. It's...
- Shit.

54:39.655 --> 54:42.658
- This is amazing news.
- Can't wait until Max sees this.

54:42.741 --> 54:46.119
{\an8}- I have moved from denial to anger.
- What do you mean?

54:46.203 --> 54:50.415
Oh, the five stages of grief.
I am angry at Max and I want revenge.

54:50.499 --> 54:54.253
And I'm not talking about squirting lube
all over his good suits.

54:54.336 --> 54:56.630
Is that something that you've done?

54:56.713 --> 54:59.675
We open the gallery
with a Broken Hearts ball.

54:59.758 --> 55:03.720
Gatsby style.
Call every influencer in New York.

55:06.515 --> 55:10.936
Honestly, I'd love to say yes, Lucy,
but I haven't heard if I got the loan.

55:11.019 --> 55:14.064
It's not looking good. I'm really worried.

55:18.443 --> 55:20.904
- But if I get it...
- We can do it?

55:22.865 --> 55:24.575
We can do it.

55:24.658 --> 55:27.703
- Yes!
- I don't know when.

55:27.786 --> 55:33.584
All right, next up we got Lucy and Nick
singing "Don't Go Breaking My Heart."

55:33.667 --> 55:35.752
I don't really... Lucy, I don't sing.

55:35.836 --> 55:40.340
We haven't spoken about this,
but I have a really shocking singing voice.

55:40.424 --> 55:43.510
Karaoke's not about talent.
It's about commitment. Everyone knows that.

55:43.594 --> 55:45.220
Yeah, but I'll make a fool of myself.

55:45.304 --> 55:48.307
That is one of life's greatest pleasures.
I should know.

55:48.390 --> 55:51.518
- Do we have Lucy? Do we have Nick?
- Yep, coming up.

55:51.602 --> 55:53.770
I'm sober. I'm dead sober.

55:53.854 --> 55:55.898
- Thought you might say that.
- Here's some shots.

55:55.981 --> 56:00.903
- Okay, no, this is very... We actually...
- No, no, no, that's perfect. Thank you.

56:00.986 --> 56:03.697
- What's your excuse now, huh?
- Nothing.

56:08.035 --> 56:11.330
- We got this, Nick. No, Nick!
- I'm gonna go.

56:19.338 --> 56:22.007
I like this song.

56:32.017 --> 56:33.560
Oh, damn.

56:36.355 --> 56:38.440
I love you!

57:06.426 --> 57:08.470
- Am I on the right rhythm?
- Oh, that's good.

57:21.316 --> 57:23.235
Nick, everyone!

57:24.236 --> 57:27.114
Does everyone remember
that it's my birthday?

57:28.115 --> 57:32.160
- How sad are you gonna be when I die?
- Terrified of life without you.

57:32.244 --> 57:35.747
Unless there's kids involved
and it will probably fill up that void.

57:35.831 --> 57:37.207
But you'll be missed.

57:37.291 --> 57:41.003
- You can't marry within a year.
- I won't. Who would I marry?

57:41.086 --> 57:43.463
- Which one of my friends would you marry?
- Amanda.

57:43.547 --> 57:46.133
Just kidding. It's not like
I've thought about it before.

57:46.216 --> 57:47.926
- I think that's a good fit.
- Right?

57:48.010 --> 57:49.428
I approve of that.

57:49.511 --> 57:53.307
- You guys talking about death again?
- It's our foreplay.

57:55.517 --> 57:57.269
Do it now.

57:57.352 --> 57:58.687
Yes, ma'am.

57:59.688 --> 58:02.107
<i>You're cute
When you beep-beep-beep, how do you...?</i>

58:02.191 --> 58:04.151
- It's not a joke, that's okay.
- That wasn't a truck...

58:04.234 --> 58:07.571
- Can't compare me to a truck.
- It wasn't a truck, but it was like...

58:07.654 --> 58:09.072
It was a truck backing up.

58:10.073 --> 58:12.743
- So let me ask you something.
- Sure.

58:12.826 --> 58:15.537
- You're spending every day with her, right?
- Yes.

58:15.621 --> 58:18.999
Dude, I haven't seen you this happy since...
Don't make me say her name.

58:19.082 --> 58:21.793
Okay, can we not talk about this,
please, Marcos?

58:21.877 --> 58:24.713
You are a straight, white dude in America.

58:24.796 --> 58:27.591
If your only thing is that
you don't wanna fall in love, like...

58:27.674 --> 58:29.134
- Can you please...?
- Cry me a river.

58:29.218 --> 58:31.094
- Marcos, can we please not do this?
- We are.

58:31.178 --> 58:33.597
We are in the conversation
you don't wanna be in.

58:33.680 --> 58:36.850
And I'm saying it...
No, I'm saying goodbye. Okay?

58:47.653 --> 58:50.614
Oh, my God. You guys, I...

58:50.697 --> 58:53.408
I'm getting too skinny.
I'm wasting away right now.

58:53.492 --> 58:56.119
I think it's really important
that we go get tacos, like...

58:56.203 --> 58:58.789
I want a taco and I wanna sleep in a taco.

58:58.872 --> 59:01.083
- I wanna drive a taco.
- Let's go.

59:01.166 --> 59:03.126
But wait, where is Nick? Did he...?

59:03.210 --> 59:06.630
Oh, he drove Marcos and Randy home.

59:06.713 --> 59:10.384
Why do you keep talking about Nick?
You should put your penis in his vagina.

59:10.467 --> 59:13.554
- Oh, I should put my penis in his vagina?
- Yeah.

59:13.637 --> 59:16.223
- I wanna get a taco first, then you can...
- Okay.

59:16.306 --> 59:18.100
- <i>Penis, penis, penis.</i>
- Okay.

59:18.183 --> 59:22.688
- Tacos first.
- <i>Tacos, tacos, tacos.</i>

59:25.691 --> 59:26.942
Where did Jeff go?

59:27.025 --> 59:29.862
Oh, he's waiting in bed for me in his mask.

59:29.945 --> 59:31.572
That's... Oh, God.

59:31.655 --> 59:34.950
- I know you love it, you're into that.
- It's too much.

59:37.286 --> 59:39.079
Okay.

59:41.123 --> 59:42.708
Remember me?

59:47.254 --> 59:48.714
Hey, Max.

59:49.715 --> 59:52.593
- What are you doing here?
- Just hoping we could talk.

59:54.219 --> 59:56.722
Okay.

59:56.805 --> 59:58.473
Go on.

59:58.557 --> 01:00:02.603
I don't really know where to start.

01:00:02.686 --> 01:00:03.770
I guess...

01:00:03.854 --> 01:00:07.399
How about "I'm sorry for causing
the worst breakup in the world's history"?

01:00:07.482 --> 01:00:10.694
Or "I'm sorry for using you
like a stepping stone for my career

01:00:10.777 --> 01:00:12.446
like Sigourney Weaver in <i>Working Girl"?</i>

01:00:12.529 --> 01:00:15.782
Or "I'm sorry for treating you
like my own personal sanitary napkin

01:00:15.866 --> 01:00:19.369
that I bled onto heavily
in the heaviest part of my period."

01:00:19.453 --> 01:00:22.289
You know that second day of your period
where you're gushing blood?

01:00:22.372 --> 01:00:24.082
- I've heard of it.
- That's what you did.

01:00:24.166 --> 01:00:25.876
And you didn't even have the courtesy

01:00:25.959 --> 01:00:28.253
to wrap it in toilet paper
when you threw it away.

01:00:28.337 --> 01:00:30.506
- Sorry.
- You belong in jail for what you've done.

01:00:30.589 --> 01:00:33.842
- We're gonna put a hex on you.
- Yeah, we're bloody witches.

01:00:33.926 --> 01:00:36.136
Ladies, that's enough.

01:00:37.137 --> 01:00:39.640
Where are your effing socks?

01:00:40.641 --> 01:00:43.727
- That's a good question.
- This is weird for us now, so...

01:00:43.810 --> 01:00:45.562
- Great friends.
- Yep.

01:00:45.646 --> 01:00:47.981
They brought out some excellent points.

01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:51.527
I'm so sorry.

01:00:53.195 --> 01:00:54.863
I don't think I can live without you.

01:00:58.951 --> 01:01:01.495
- What about Amelia?
- Amelia.

01:01:01.578 --> 01:01:05.123
Come on. Amelia? We broke up.

01:01:05.207 --> 01:01:07.626
I haven't stopped thinking about you
since I ran into you

01:01:07.709 --> 01:01:09.753
and then I read about you
in <i>New York Magazine.</i>

01:01:09.837 --> 01:01:11.755
I was wrong about you, Lucy.

01:01:12.756 --> 01:01:14.716
I wanna be with you.

01:01:17.177 --> 01:01:18.762
I don't know.

01:01:18.846 --> 01:01:20.264
Hey.

01:01:21.265 --> 01:01:23.642
- Hey.
- What's this guy doing here?

01:01:23.725 --> 01:01:26.478
Why is your assistant talking to me
like that?

01:01:26.562 --> 01:01:28.146
I'm not her assistant, guy.

01:01:28.230 --> 01:01:30.190
Why are you bringing her a cake
at 3 a.m., guy?

01:01:30.274 --> 01:01:32.317
- Because I can.
- Guys.

01:01:34.152 --> 01:01:34.987
It's okay.

01:01:37.614 --> 01:01:39.199
I was dropping this off.

01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:43.537
Custom single-layered cake.

01:01:45.330 --> 01:01:48.417
- You brought me Amanda's cake?
- Yeah.

01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:52.379
Well, you know, Marcos paid for it, and...

01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:56.717
I don't know,
he really likes you, so I thought I'd...

01:01:57.843 --> 01:01:59.928
Marcos likes me.

01:02:00.012 --> 01:02:01.471
Right.

01:02:03.682 --> 01:02:05.058
Yeah.

01:02:06.977 --> 01:02:09.730
We were kind of in the middle of something.

01:02:14.860 --> 01:02:16.945
I'm gonna go.

01:02:20.657 --> 01:02:22.075
Hey.

01:02:23.952 --> 01:02:25.704
How about it? Let's have a drink.

01:02:25.787 --> 01:02:30.709
I mean, you've seen it so many times,
but Harvard's in the corner, she's cowering.

01:02:30.792 --> 01:02:33.003
- Oh, my God.
- I'm like, "This is crazy."

01:02:33.086 --> 01:02:35.506
- I really miss the Woolf Gallery.
- You do?

01:02:35.589 --> 01:02:38.342
Yeah, of course. It was my dream job.

01:02:38.425 --> 01:02:40.719
It was run by a woman so ahead of her time,

01:02:40.802 --> 01:02:46.016
she gave space and a voice to artists
no one deigned to care about or listen to.

01:02:47.142 --> 01:02:49.853
See, I never even knew you felt that way.

01:02:49.937 --> 01:02:50.979
You never asked.

01:02:51.980 --> 01:02:55.817
You never really asked me
about myself, ever.

01:02:56.818 --> 01:03:01.657
- I know I made a detour...
- A detour? That's what we're calling that?

01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:04.993
Your GPS just didn't work
the day you cheated on me, or what's...?

01:03:05.077 --> 01:03:07.621
It wasn't a detour, it was a big mistake.

01:03:08.622 --> 01:03:10.082
Please give me another chance?

01:03:12.376 --> 01:03:15.254
And you're serious about this?

01:03:16.463 --> 01:03:18.465
Would you close your eyes?

01:03:20.092 --> 01:03:22.636
- Okay.
- Can you put your hands out?

01:03:29.017 --> 01:03:31.812
- Okay, open them.
- Wait.

01:03:32.813 --> 01:03:35.357
What? How did you get this?

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:36.525
I took it.

01:03:36.608 --> 01:03:38.819
Our love story's not over.

01:03:40.028 --> 01:03:42.614
You broke into the gallery?

01:03:43.866 --> 01:03:48.036
Wow, we really need to work
on the security situation.

01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:50.122
Just have dinner with me, please?

01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:55.377
I'm actually... I have a lot
of late night commitments, so...

01:03:55.460 --> 01:04:00.048
I figured you'd say that,
so I thought about: "What about breakfast?"

01:04:00.132 --> 01:04:03.135
Oh, yeah, no, I'm not a morning person,
so that won't work.

01:04:03.218 --> 01:04:06.138
There is a meal somewhere in the middle.

01:04:07.139 --> 01:04:10.684
- Do you know what it's called?
- Fine. Lunch.

01:04:10.767 --> 01:04:14.188
But no booze, except for rosé.
But that's just pink water.

01:04:16.565 --> 01:04:21.987
Hey! I picked up some vintage rackets.
Thought they might look cool in here, right?

01:04:28.035 --> 01:04:29.828
Is everything okay?

01:04:32.581 --> 01:04:34.708
I didn't get the loan.

01:04:35.876 --> 01:04:38.045
So this is it.

01:04:41.507 --> 01:04:44.760
Oh, shit. I'm... I'm so sorry, Nick.

01:04:44.843 --> 01:04:46.303
This really sucks.

01:04:46.386 --> 01:04:49.139
But, hey, we can figure something out.

01:04:49.223 --> 01:04:52.476
- This is just a setback.
- It's not a setback.

01:04:53.477 --> 01:04:54.937
This is real life, Lucy.

01:04:55.020 --> 01:04:59.149
You know, we can't all live
in your fantasy land of magical thinking.

01:04:59.233 --> 01:05:03.111
I can't just go into a closet,
wish really hard, and it will all work out.

01:05:03.195 --> 01:05:05.113
That's not how life works.

01:05:06.114 --> 01:05:07.950
That's what you think of me?

01:05:09.117 --> 01:05:13.455
If the Chloe closes, the gallery closes too.
We're in this together.

01:05:13.539 --> 01:05:16.583
No, we're not. Okay?

01:05:16.667 --> 01:05:19.378
I let myself get distracted,
but not anymore,

01:05:19.461 --> 01:05:21.338
so take your stuff and get out of here.

01:05:22.965 --> 01:05:24.132
So that's it?

01:05:24.216 --> 01:05:26.426
Yeah. That's it.

01:05:32.850 --> 01:05:34.184
Okay.

01:05:34.268 --> 01:05:37.855
Yeah, you can just shut me out,
but I made a commitment to every person

01:05:37.938 --> 01:05:40.774
that walked through that door
with their heart on their sleeve.

01:05:41.775 --> 01:05:42.818
I am not giving up.

01:05:45.112 --> 01:05:47.239
And you shouldn't either.

01:06:49.218 --> 01:06:50.552
If you'll just meet with me,

01:06:50.636 --> 01:06:53.931
I can show you the Broken Heart Gallery
takes a whole new approach to art.

01:06:54.014 --> 01:06:56.725
We're trending on Twitter.
We have 50,000 followers.

01:06:56.808 --> 01:07:00.771
Everyone is damaged.
Have you ever been heartbroken? Hello?

01:07:00.854 --> 01:07:02.022
Hello?

01:07:02.105 --> 01:07:04.483
Oh, my God. He hung up on me.

01:07:04.566 --> 01:07:06.026
That was the last one.

01:07:06.109 --> 01:07:09.404
I've tried every gallery
in the greater tristate area.

01:07:09.488 --> 01:07:11.073
You haven't tried everyone.

01:07:12.074 --> 01:07:13.867
Oh, right, yeah.

01:07:13.951 --> 01:07:17.996
I'm sure Eva just misses watching me
eat my own ass in front of her eyes.

01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:19.957
Her and her friends, just:

01:07:20.958 --> 01:07:23.168
You never know unless you try.

01:07:23.252 --> 01:07:28.507
No. Eva, she gave me a second chance.
She's not about to give me a third.

01:07:28.590 --> 01:07:32.010
Well, what if a handsome man,

01:07:32.094 --> 01:07:35.681
with a cute, cute butt,
put in a good word for you

01:07:35.764 --> 01:07:39.685
and all you have to do is pick up the phone
and see what happens?

01:07:39.768 --> 01:07:41.854
- Really?
- Maybe.

01:07:42.855 --> 01:07:43.897
Cliffhanger.

01:07:43.981 --> 01:07:47.943
You're erratic, irresponsible,
and, quite frankly, a liability.

01:07:48.026 --> 01:07:53.115
It's young people like you
who reaffirm my choice not to procreate.

01:07:53.198 --> 01:07:57.452
The last time I saw you was like listening
to Brad Pitt talk about architecture.

01:07:57.536 --> 01:08:00.998
- It just went on and on and on.
- Right.

01:08:01.081 --> 01:08:03.417
And on and on and on.

01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:05.711
It was utterly relentless.

01:08:05.794 --> 01:08:07.171
Please give me a chance.

01:08:07.254 --> 01:08:09.590
The Broken Heart Gallery,
it's changed my life.

01:08:09.673 --> 01:08:12.259
Clearly, otherwise,
you wouldn't be here groveling.

01:08:12.342 --> 01:08:15.345
Oh, well, I think
groveling is a strong term.

01:08:15.429 --> 01:08:17.930
This is the definition of groveling.

01:08:19.725 --> 01:08:21.852
I've learned a few things in my day.

01:08:21.935 --> 01:08:24.813
Never look at your body naked
under a fluorescent light.

01:08:24.897 --> 01:08:29.984
It's only okay to bounce a check once.
After that, it's a thing you're known for.

01:08:30.068 --> 01:08:34.363
And when you see talent, grab it.

01:08:35.657 --> 01:08:39.203
I'd like to include the Broken Heart Gallery

01:08:39.286 --> 01:08:44.249
as an exhibit here at the Woolf in one week.

01:08:44.332 --> 01:08:49.462
Show your collection alongside mine.

01:08:49.546 --> 01:08:51.048
What?

01:08:51.131 --> 01:08:54.051
Did I drop acid and this is my ego death?

01:08:54.134 --> 01:08:56.136
No, no. It's a huge opportunity.

01:08:56.220 --> 01:08:59.055
Don't worry, I'm gonna be here
to guide you every step of the way.

01:08:59.139 --> 01:09:00.974
Oh, that won't be necessary. Thank you.

01:09:01.058 --> 01:09:03.560
Oh, my God. Thank you so, so much.

01:09:03.644 --> 01:09:05.687
I mean, I don't even know what to say.

01:09:05.770 --> 01:09:11.984
What do you say when Michael Fassbender
invites you to lie naked by his pool?

01:09:16.490 --> 01:09:18.825
I do have one condition.

01:09:18.908 --> 01:09:20.827
I have been working so hard for this.

01:09:20.911 --> 01:09:22.828
This is literally
a lifelong dream come true.

01:09:22.912 --> 01:09:28.752
Well, let me be the first to say
"congratulations" and "you're welcome."

01:09:28.836 --> 01:09:31.129
Come on, let's go celebrate.

01:09:46.812 --> 01:09:50.649
- Sorry, I'm late. I got caught up...
- Cool, cool, cool. I don't care.

01:09:50.732 --> 01:09:53.569
- Teach me how to break up with someone.
- What?

01:09:53.652 --> 01:09:56.154
Just walk me through your dumping process.

01:09:56.238 --> 01:09:59.700
We don't call it that. It sounds harsh.
Wait, why are we doing this?

01:09:59.783 --> 01:10:03.871
Because I just... I need to let Max go.
Once and for all.

01:10:03.954 --> 01:10:04.872
Good.

01:10:05.998 --> 01:10:08.584
Teach me. I'm your vessel.

01:10:17.509 --> 01:10:22.931
Most stories are stories of... betrayal.

01:10:23.015 --> 01:10:28.145
And ours is a story of hope.

01:10:29.146 --> 01:10:34.860
Hope that what we shared
will guide you... home.

01:10:35.986 --> 01:10:37.571
Yeah.

01:10:37.654 --> 01:10:39.698
- Come closer.
- Okay.

01:10:40.699 --> 01:10:42.367
Thank you...

01:10:43.660 --> 01:10:45.871
for being my home.

01:10:50.834 --> 01:10:52.085
- Oh, my God.
- I know.

01:10:52.169 --> 01:10:54.213
- Oh, my God!
- I know!

01:10:54.296 --> 01:10:57.007
Okay, but I'm definitely not doing that.

01:11:04.223 --> 01:11:07.684
Hey. Is it time for dinner?

01:11:11.647 --> 01:11:15.442
I just wanna know.
What happened with Amelia?

01:11:16.485 --> 01:11:19.780
You know what happened. That's over.

01:11:19.863 --> 01:11:21.782
Just be honest with me.

01:11:26.203 --> 01:11:28.580
I really thought I was gonna marry her.

01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:32.000
And she wasn't ready.

01:11:32.084 --> 01:11:33.836
And she moved to Paris.

01:11:33.919 --> 01:11:37.714
And then she came back
right when she sensed you could be happy,

01:11:37.798 --> 01:11:40.634
which is always how that happens.

01:11:40.717 --> 01:11:43.303
So you kept hurting me
because she kept hurting you.

01:11:43.387 --> 01:11:46.473
- I didn't mean to hurt you.
- No, of course not.

01:11:47.474 --> 01:11:51.144
You're the hero of your love story
and the villain in mine.

01:11:52.479 --> 01:11:54.606
We're just not meant to be together.

01:11:56.650 --> 01:11:58.318
I'm gonna go.

01:12:01.822 --> 01:12:05.117
Paris, it's an amazing place, and...

01:12:06.118 --> 01:12:10.163
We were staying at La Bristol,
which is incredibly fancy.

01:12:10.247 --> 01:12:12.791
It's a little overrated, if you ask me.

01:12:12.875 --> 01:12:16.795
I drew a bath,
and I wanted her to get in it with me.

01:12:16.879 --> 01:12:20.215
Personally, I hate baths.
They're a warm, wet place to overthink.

01:12:20.299 --> 01:12:25.137
So she left to get a pastry
for... five hours.

01:12:25.220 --> 01:12:28.390
I bummed a cigarette off of Olivier.

01:12:28.473 --> 01:12:32.019
I sat in the tub, shriveling.

01:12:32.102 --> 01:12:34.855
So, naturally,
I realized I had to move to Paris.

01:12:35.898 --> 01:12:37.357
I kept the bath water.

01:12:38.358 --> 01:12:40.527
Oh, sweet Jesus, he was gorgeous.

01:12:40.611 --> 01:12:41.695
I drank a little.

01:12:41.778 --> 01:12:45.240
So, in conclusion, I've made hoarding chic.

01:12:45.324 --> 01:12:48.619
You'd be proud.
A triumph for pack rats everywhere.

01:12:48.702 --> 01:12:50.579
Who are you talking to?

01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:54.249
No one.

01:12:54.333 --> 01:12:57.586
You are always making
these weird, sneaky phone calls

01:12:57.669 --> 01:12:59.171
and leaving messages for someone.

01:12:59.254 --> 01:13:04.092
Are you here to talk about my phone bill?
Or are you here to apologize?

01:13:08.430 --> 01:13:09.681
I'm sorry.

01:13:09.765 --> 01:13:12.434
Option B. Excellent choice.

01:13:13.519 --> 01:13:16.063
You were the first person I wanted to tell.

01:13:16.146 --> 01:13:21.193
Miraculously, a private lender backed me
and I got the loan.

01:13:22.319 --> 01:13:23.862
- What?
- I did it, I got it.

01:13:23.946 --> 01:13:27.866
You got...? That's amazing!
You're not the only one with good news.

01:13:28.867 --> 01:13:31.286
Eva Woolf wants to make
the Broken Heart Gallery

01:13:31.370 --> 01:13:34.164
a reality by sponsoring it at the Woolf.

01:13:34.248 --> 01:13:35.290
No way.

01:13:35.374 --> 01:13:39.336
And despite you being a dick monster,

01:13:39.419 --> 01:13:41.630
since the hotel is gonna be saved,

01:13:41.713 --> 01:13:44.550
I wanna keep the exhibit at the Chloe.

01:13:45.634 --> 01:13:47.761
I'm really happy for you, Lucy.

01:13:50.180 --> 01:13:51.723
You deserve it.

01:13:52.724 --> 01:13:56.854
I'm sorry. I've never had a guy be happy
for my success before.

01:13:56.937 --> 01:14:00.274
It's kind of weird, but... No, it's good.

01:14:00.357 --> 01:14:03.652
Wait. How are we gonna pull it off in time?

01:14:03.735 --> 01:14:06.822
Please. I've been waiting my whole life
to pull this off.

01:14:54.786 --> 01:15:01.001
Anastasia, Irina, Valeria, Yulia...

01:15:02.002 --> 01:15:06.006
I need to make it right with the Russians
or Putin is gonna have me poisoned.

01:15:24.149 --> 01:15:25.108
We did it.

01:15:26.109 --> 01:15:27.611
We did.

01:15:27.694 --> 01:15:31.907
We're good together you and me.
A monster and a human.

01:15:31.990 --> 01:15:34.117
A what and a who?

01:15:34.201 --> 01:15:37.412
Well, humans need monsters
to stir things up,

01:15:37.496 --> 01:15:40.082
and monsters need humans
to fix everything they break.

01:15:40.165 --> 01:15:41.750
It's just simple science.

01:15:42.751 --> 01:15:46.839
Do you think, in life,
you ever get to feel successful?

01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:49.049
Or is it just an illusion,

01:15:49.132 --> 01:15:51.802
like, at any given moment,
it could be taken away from you

01:15:51.885 --> 01:15:54.721
because it was never yours to begin with?

01:15:54.805 --> 01:15:57.641
I think everyone feels that way.

01:15:59.977 --> 01:16:04.565
No one tells you that being an adult is
just walking around, feeling like a fraud.

01:16:04.648 --> 01:16:05.983
You know?

01:16:06.066 --> 01:16:08.193
Like, who gave me a credit card?

01:16:08.277 --> 01:16:10.863
And how do I cancel
my gym membership? It's...

01:16:11.864 --> 01:16:13.490
What does Congress even do?

01:16:14.491 --> 01:16:16.618
But you do know what Congress does, right?

01:16:17.619 --> 01:16:18.579
Yeah.

01:16:19.580 --> 01:16:21.164
Yeah.

01:16:25.794 --> 01:16:28.130
Do you have any plans tomorrow?

01:16:28.213 --> 01:16:29.506
What do you wanna do?

01:16:30.507 --> 01:16:35.179
Well, you know those sneaky phone calls
I've been making?

01:16:36.180 --> 01:16:38.265
I wanna introduce you to someone.

01:16:40.017 --> 01:16:41.351
I'm in.

01:16:55.032 --> 01:16:58.160
Good morning, boys.
Brought your lotto tickets.

01:16:58.243 --> 01:17:00.078
And I got a good feeling about this one.

01:17:00.162 --> 01:17:03.832
Remember the deal:
We're gonna split this even. Okay?

01:17:03.916 --> 01:17:06.168
We got a witness, so...

01:17:08.921 --> 01:17:10.756
Hey, Joe.

01:17:12.090 --> 01:17:15.802
I brought your spicy snacks,
but don't tattle on me like last time, okay?

01:17:16.803 --> 01:17:18.388
That's my guy.

01:17:19.389 --> 01:17:21.058
Hey, Cheryl.

01:17:21.141 --> 01:17:22.893
Hi.

01:17:25.437 --> 01:17:26.813
Who's the dime?

01:17:26.897 --> 01:17:28.774
Nick, this is Cheryl.

01:17:28.857 --> 01:17:30.150
Nice to meet you.

01:17:30.234 --> 01:17:32.444
This little slice isn't your girlfriend,
is she?

01:17:32.528 --> 01:17:36.532
No. I'm as single as a dollar bill.

01:17:37.533 --> 01:17:40.035
Want a cocktail? I'm buying.

01:17:40.118 --> 01:17:43.247
Sure. I mean,
it's 5:00 somewhere, right? Huh, Cheryl?

01:17:43.330 --> 01:17:45.958
- Can I sit here?
- Yeah, sit down, take a load off.

01:17:46.041 --> 01:17:47.543
Look at you.

01:17:48.544 --> 01:17:50.712
Want to play a board game?

01:17:59.304 --> 01:18:00.180
Monopoly.

01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:03.350
My all-time favorite.

01:18:03.433 --> 01:18:05.060
Me too.

01:18:05.143 --> 01:18:08.313
I used to play almost every night
with my daughter...

01:18:09.606 --> 01:18:11.275
Lucy.

01:18:13.902 --> 01:18:15.612
Lucy.

01:18:20.909 --> 01:18:22.494
I'm sorry, I didn't...

01:18:24.496 --> 01:18:28.959
Yeah. Yeah, so if you could just stop
flirting with my mother, that'd be great.

01:18:29.042 --> 01:18:31.920
Her mother. I am far too young.

01:18:32.004 --> 01:18:35.674
Look at this body.
It's as tight as a Mormon teenager.

01:18:35.757 --> 01:18:37.634
- Mom!
- What?

01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:40.512
Are you jealous?

01:18:40.596 --> 01:18:44.224
You know, a wise woman once told me
jealousy is unbecoming.

01:18:44.308 --> 01:18:46.685
Oh, really?

01:18:47.686 --> 01:18:49.104
You said that.

01:18:53.025 --> 01:18:55.110
I love piano players.

01:18:55.194 --> 01:18:57.362
- Is he your boyfriend?
- No.

01:18:57.446 --> 01:19:00.991
- Well, you can't marry him.
- No. No, I would never.

01:19:01.074 --> 01:19:02.910
I'm going to.

01:19:02.993 --> 01:19:04.369
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

01:19:04.453 --> 01:19:06.705
Well, I'll be maid of honor, then.

01:19:06.788 --> 01:19:07.956
Okay.

01:19:08.957 --> 01:19:11.627
I love this song.

01:19:12.628 --> 01:19:14.713
We used to listen to this
when I cooked dinner.

01:19:14.796 --> 01:19:18.342
"Cooked" is a very strong word
for what you used to do with food.

01:19:18.425 --> 01:19:20.511
Come and dance with me.

01:19:27.226 --> 01:19:28.227
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:19:59.174 --> 01:20:01.593
Thank you for taking me today.

01:20:02.594 --> 01:20:04.805
Thank you for being there.

01:20:06.723 --> 01:20:09.518
It's usually hard,

01:20:09.601 --> 01:20:12.938
but today was really nice.

01:20:14.481 --> 01:20:16.984
Do you want to have a drink with me?

01:20:17.067 --> 01:20:18.527
Yeah.

01:20:21.989 --> 01:20:24.533
We're not gonna drink down here.

01:20:26.034 --> 01:20:28.370
We're going to a bar?

01:20:29.913 --> 01:20:31.957
Can you come with me?

01:20:32.958 --> 01:20:34.501
Okay.

01:20:56.690 --> 01:20:58.859
I've never been in here.

01:20:58.942 --> 01:21:01.069
I wanna show you something.

01:21:04.531 --> 01:21:07.618
Shut up with that secret trapdoor.

01:21:07.701 --> 01:21:09.369
Just follow me. Come on.

01:21:10.370 --> 01:21:12.247
Watch your head.

01:21:12.331 --> 01:21:14.166
What is this? Hipster Narnia?

01:21:18.128 --> 01:21:21.340
You just made this secret, sexy bar
on your own?

01:21:21.423 --> 01:21:25.636
Well, I have many hidden talents.

01:21:25.719 --> 01:21:29.431
Oh, how about you just casually tickling
the ivories back there?

01:21:29.515 --> 01:21:32.351
Way to bury the lede, Piano Man.

01:21:34.937 --> 01:21:36.438
Which one?

01:21:41.318 --> 01:21:43.487
Here's to finishing what we started.

01:21:44.488 --> 01:21:46.323
To finishing what we started.

01:22:15.102 --> 01:22:16.687
Well...

01:22:17.813 --> 01:22:19.147
So...

01:22:20.148 --> 01:22:22.442
I just saw you naked.

01:22:23.443 --> 01:22:25.279
That is how sex works.

01:22:25.362 --> 01:22:26.864
Right.

01:22:27.906 --> 01:22:29.283
But we're...

01:22:29.366 --> 01:22:31.118
We're friends.

01:22:38.876 --> 01:22:41.587
What if we're more than friends?

01:22:44.756 --> 01:22:47.426
How do we find out?

01:22:48.427 --> 01:22:52.097
You know, I've honestly been sitting here,

01:22:52.181 --> 01:22:57.769
just racking my brain through ways
to figure it out.

01:22:57.853 --> 01:23:00.522
And I only seem to have come up
with one solution.

01:23:00.606 --> 01:23:02.191
What's that?

01:23:04.193 --> 01:23:06.862
I think we gotta do it again.

01:23:06.945 --> 01:23:07.821
Yeah, me too.

01:23:27.216 --> 01:23:30.177
<i>Meet me at the neon store
at 10 a.m. tomorrow.</i>

01:23:30.260 --> 01:23:32.387
<i>I have another surprise for you.</i>

01:23:32.471 --> 01:23:34.056
A surprise?

01:23:34.139 --> 01:23:36.016
Count monster in.

01:23:39.019 --> 01:23:41.146
So now that you and Nick are...

01:23:42.439 --> 01:23:44.900
Is that what you think
heterosexual sex looks like?

01:23:44.983 --> 01:23:48.695
Makes me nervous just thinking about it,
but now that you guys are, you know,

01:23:48.779 --> 01:23:50.197
what have you collected from him?

01:23:50.280 --> 01:23:52.324
A safety net because she rescued him.

01:23:52.407 --> 01:23:54.493
Well, we're partners.
Partners help each other.

01:23:54.576 --> 01:23:58.038
- And visit each other's moms.
- That's very serious.

01:23:58.121 --> 01:24:00.082
Oh, and by the way, my mom fully hit on him.

01:24:00.165 --> 01:24:01.375
Cheryl is a legend.

01:24:01.458 --> 01:24:03.544
- Oh, yes. Cheryl.
- Get it, Cheryl.

01:24:03.627 --> 01:24:04.461
Lucy.

01:24:09.424 --> 01:24:12.427
- How much I owe you?
- No, no, no. These are on me.

01:24:12.511 --> 01:24:14.137
It's the least I could do.

01:24:14.221 --> 01:24:16.849
Your gallery has helped me so much.

01:24:17.850 --> 01:24:19.685
After Dwayne died, I was lost.

01:24:19.768 --> 01:24:22.855
One minute we were laughing,
stealing that bottle of champagne.

01:24:22.938 --> 01:24:24.147
And the next...

01:24:26.733 --> 01:24:28.694
I kept everything that he owned.

01:24:29.695 --> 01:24:34.032
The thought of letting go meant
facing reality and I just couldn't, so...

01:24:34.116 --> 01:24:35.868
Again, you really helped.

01:24:39.288 --> 01:24:40.622
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:24:41.623 --> 01:24:44.710
- So I'll see you at the gallery opening?
- Yes. Most definitely.

01:24:44.793 --> 01:24:46.753
And I'm gonna bring a date.

01:24:46.837 --> 01:24:48.589
Nice.

01:24:50.465 --> 01:24:52.634
Look at you, Oprah, healing the masses.

01:24:52.718 --> 01:24:56.513
I think what Amanda is trying to say is,
you're very inspiring.

01:24:56.597 --> 01:25:00.726
- You should have your own TED Talk.
- No, I'm trying to say she's Dolly Parton.

01:25:00.809 --> 01:25:04.229
We had eight blissful years together.

01:25:04.313 --> 01:25:07.191
He was really focused on work, but...

01:25:08.233 --> 01:25:10.068
That's what I loved about him.

01:25:11.069 --> 01:25:14.198
His passion, his intellect.

01:25:14.281 --> 01:25:16.700
This is how I like to remember him.

01:25:19.703 --> 01:25:21.955
I mean, isn't he beautiful?

01:26:04.748 --> 01:26:06.166
Nick?

01:26:06.250 --> 01:26:08.544
So if you just wanna come through...

01:26:09.545 --> 01:26:11.004
Lucy.

01:26:12.673 --> 01:26:14.132
Hi.

01:26:14.216 --> 01:26:15.342
Hi.

01:26:15.425 --> 01:26:16.301
I...

01:26:17.302 --> 01:26:19.680
This is my...

01:26:19.763 --> 01:26:21.098
I'm Chloe.

01:26:33.986 --> 01:26:36.154
Lucy. Wait. Stop, okay?

01:26:36.238 --> 01:26:39.408
Chloe? As in the Chloe Hotel?

01:26:39.491 --> 01:26:42.286
- You told me it was for your grandma.
- No, I didn't. You assumed.

01:26:42.369 --> 01:26:43.787
Like you always do.

01:26:43.871 --> 01:26:45.414
You never corrected me.

01:26:45.497 --> 01:26:47.040
- You built this for her?
- No.

01:26:47.124 --> 01:26:49.293
- Are you with her?
- No. If you just give me a second

01:26:49.376 --> 01:26:50.961
- to explain it to you...
- Explain what?

01:26:51.044 --> 01:26:56.884
You mocked me for keeping Max's tie
and you built a hotel in her honor?

01:26:56.967 --> 01:26:59.845
That's not fair.
You started a gallery for Max.

01:26:59.928 --> 01:27:02.848
No. No. You don't get to do that.

01:27:02.931 --> 01:27:06.852
I showed you exactly who I am.
From the very beginning.

01:27:07.936 --> 01:27:09.938
I introduced you to my mom.

01:27:10.981 --> 01:27:14.359
And now you've lied to me? I feel like...
I don't... I don't even know you.

01:27:14.443 --> 01:27:18.030
I wanted to tell you, okay?
I just didn't know when or how.

01:27:18.113 --> 01:27:21.408
It's not easy for me to open up
like it is for you.

01:27:22.409 --> 01:27:24.453
No, it's not easy for anyone, Nick.

01:27:26.038 --> 01:27:29.917
The best part about being selfish is,
you get to do it alone.

01:27:31.043 --> 01:27:33.462
This is clearly a bad time. I'm gonna go.

01:27:33.545 --> 01:27:37.758
No. Your name is on the door. You stay.

01:27:37.841 --> 01:27:39.092
I'll go.

01:27:43.138 --> 01:27:47.226
Hey. I guess she slipped this under the door
one night when I was working late.

01:27:48.185 --> 01:27:53.106
I didn't find it, you know,
until two years after we broke up.

01:27:55.734 --> 01:27:57.611
- Tonya's out of my life.
- Obviously.

01:27:57.694 --> 01:28:00.697
I had to dump her ass, you know?
Like N'Sync. Like "Bye, Bye, Bye."

01:28:00.781 --> 01:28:01.990
- Hey, guys!
- Okay, I don't...

01:28:03.492 --> 01:28:05.577
Is Lucy home?

01:28:07.663 --> 01:28:09.081
She's on the roof? Great. Thanks.

01:28:09.164 --> 01:28:13.418
Just so you know, if a gorgeous woman
just pushed you off the roof,

01:28:13.502 --> 01:28:18.465
and she, you know... She was wearing
a blue, really, like, beautiful jumpsuit.

01:28:18.549 --> 01:28:21.802
And you fell to the ground
and you just died instantly.

01:28:21.885 --> 01:28:24.847
And your lifeless body was
just kind of sitting there.

01:28:24.930 --> 01:28:27.724
- And then this other girl...
- Who's also gorgeous.

01:28:27.808 --> 01:28:29.518
- Gorgeous.
- Who's a stay-at-home model.

01:28:29.601 --> 01:28:31.687
Stay-at-home model in a purple top.

01:28:31.770 --> 01:28:36.692
If she was just driving this monster truck
and she just kept running over your face.

01:28:36.775 --> 01:28:39.444
Just over and over and over and over.

01:28:39.528 --> 01:28:43.365
Yeah. And, like, you were completely
not recognizable anymore.

01:28:44.366 --> 01:28:48.620
We would say it was an accident.
Yeah. And we have two alibis and a Jeff.

01:28:48.704 --> 01:28:52.165
And I know from law school,
that's a really strong case.

01:28:52.249 --> 01:28:54.793
Ironclad.

01:28:56.753 --> 01:28:57.671
Cool.

01:28:58.672 --> 01:29:01.717
Okay. Goodbye. Nice to...

01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:03.594
Jeff. Great.

01:29:30.162 --> 01:29:32.956
Listen, I wanted to tell you that...

01:29:35.375 --> 01:29:37.085
What?

01:29:40.714 --> 01:29:44.426
The Broken Hearts Ball is your night,
and I just wanted you to know that...

01:29:45.427 --> 01:29:48.680
I'm gonna steer clear of the hotel, okay?

01:29:49.681 --> 01:29:52.100
The Chloe Hotel?

01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:57.606
For what it's worth,
I was only showing her around.

01:29:57.689 --> 01:30:04.571
I named the hotel after her a long time ago,
and it got too late and too expensive...

01:30:05.739 --> 01:30:07.574
to change it.

01:30:11.578 --> 01:30:13.539
I'm sorry.

01:30:22.381 --> 01:30:23.841
Okay.

01:30:48.282 --> 01:30:51.785
Many artists have fallen in love with me.

01:30:52.786 --> 01:30:56.874
I didn't see you there.
But, yes, I know about all your lovers.

01:30:57.875 --> 01:31:01.420
That's a very strange thing to say.
Very odd.

01:31:02.421 --> 01:31:06.175
I have something for your installation.

01:31:07.843 --> 01:31:10.679
I married a man
who was jealous about everything.

01:31:10.762 --> 01:31:13.390
If I was enthusiastic about a book,
about a place,

01:31:13.473 --> 01:31:16.185
about a flower, about a human being...

01:31:16.268 --> 01:31:18.061
jealous.

01:31:22.065 --> 01:31:23.567
There's nothing inside.

01:31:23.650 --> 01:31:26.486
I left him. I sold the ring.

01:31:26.570 --> 01:31:28.822
I started the Woolf Gallery,

01:31:28.906 --> 01:31:33.243
and I vowed to represent artists
who made me feel enthusiastic.

01:31:33.327 --> 01:31:34.828
I never looked back.

01:31:37.289 --> 01:31:39.249
Did you regret marrying him?

01:31:39.333 --> 01:31:40.209
Never.

01:31:41.210 --> 01:31:44.379
I wouldn't be me
if our paths hadn't crossed.

01:31:44.463 --> 01:31:47.508
I also wouldn't be me if I hadn't let go.

01:31:49.218 --> 01:31:51.595
Pain, my dear, is inevitable.

01:31:52.596 --> 01:31:57.059
It's what you do with it that matters.

01:32:15.327 --> 01:32:17.871
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey. How you doing?

01:32:17.955 --> 01:32:19.498
What are you doing?

01:32:19.581 --> 01:32:22.251
- Oh, hello! Thank you.
- I've never seen her do that before.

01:32:22.334 --> 01:32:23.794
That's weird.

01:33:20.893 --> 01:33:24.313
I don't really know what I'm doing here.

01:33:25.480 --> 01:33:29.234
I don't know.
I've never been broken up with.

01:33:30.277 --> 01:33:32.112
I don't know what it is about this room,

01:33:32.196 --> 01:33:34.948
but there's something about it
that's so much less...

01:33:35.032 --> 01:33:36.033
"Hoardery"?

01:33:36.116 --> 01:33:40.329
Doesn't look like a homeless woman
just lives here in her free time.

01:33:40.412 --> 01:33:43.415
You know what? I should
throw you guys out in the trash.

01:33:43.498 --> 01:33:45.834
Marie Kondo your asses. How about that?

01:33:45.918 --> 01:33:49.546
- Is Nick coming tonight?
- Yeah. Inquiring minds wanna know.

01:33:49.630 --> 01:33:53.050
Don't know, don't care.
It's my night. I'm just doing me.

01:33:54.343 --> 01:33:55.677
- Fine. Later.
- No, now.

01:33:55.761 --> 01:33:58.222
- You always say later and you never pay.
- I always pay.

01:33:58.305 --> 01:34:01.683
- You owe me so much...
- Pay? Wait, what? What is going on here?

01:34:01.767 --> 01:34:04.770
- What secrets do you hold?
- Nothing.

01:34:04.853 --> 01:34:05.729
Nadine?

01:34:05.812 --> 01:34:08.524
We bet that you
and Nick would get back together.

01:34:08.607 --> 01:34:11.860
I said no. I won, obviously. I always win.

01:34:11.944 --> 01:34:14.363
- You what?
- We bet on all your relationships.

01:34:14.446 --> 01:34:16.198
How do you think I afford this lifestyle?

01:34:16.281 --> 01:34:19.034
- Wait. How much have you bet over the years?
- Like...

01:34:19.117 --> 01:34:20.369
- Pennies.
- Barely anything.

01:34:20.452 --> 01:34:22.663
No, tell me right now. You tell me. You...

01:34:22.746 --> 01:34:25.123
Seven hundred and ninety-eight dollars,
34 cents.

01:34:26.458 --> 01:34:30.379
Now? You choose to speak now?
Oh, we're getting a divorce.

01:34:30.462 --> 01:34:31.505
We were never married.

01:34:31.588 --> 01:34:35.050
Well, hurry up and ask me
so I can fricking divorce you already!

01:34:37.177 --> 01:34:39.388
- Will you marry me?
- Get out!

01:34:39.471 --> 01:34:43.684
That's why I think possums are pretty much
the coolest animal in the entire world.

01:34:43.767 --> 01:34:47.396
But if you're gonna have possums in there,
meerkats need to be in the conversation.

01:34:47.479 --> 01:34:50.232
They can stand up on hind legs like this,
looking around everywhere.

01:34:50.315 --> 01:34:53.610
They also can run on four legs.
Feed them bugs if they were your pet.

01:34:53.694 --> 01:34:54.903
They run around in the desert.

01:34:54.987 --> 01:34:57.990
Don't touch that jerky.
It's too close to the bug spray.

01:34:58.991 --> 01:35:01.827
- So you're really not coming?
- I don't know, man.

01:35:01.910 --> 01:35:04.705
Don't feel well and I'm worried
about the hotel opening and...

01:35:04.788 --> 01:35:07.124
I think I'm coming down
with a fever. So, yeah.

01:35:07.207 --> 01:35:09.126
Do you mind feeling my forehead?

01:35:09.209 --> 01:35:10.794
- It's really hot, right?
- You're fine.

01:35:10.878 --> 01:35:11.837
That's what I thought.

01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:14.131
We have to go.
I didn't put heels on to show up late.

01:35:14.214 --> 01:35:17.301
Real comforting.
You guys are gonna be great parents.

01:35:17.384 --> 01:35:20.846
A sick man disgusts me. You need
to explain to him what's going on.

01:35:20.929 --> 01:35:23.098
No, I don't. He's a moron. Look at him.

01:35:23.182 --> 01:35:24.558
Like you're so evolved?

01:35:24.641 --> 01:35:27.686
- All men are morons. We let you run things.
- Not the humanity speech.

01:35:27.769 --> 01:35:30.981
You ruined the planet, started wars,
killed the bees. You raped and pillaged.

01:35:31.064 --> 01:35:33.650
And if you opened your eyes
to what was going on in the world,

01:35:33.734 --> 01:35:35.485
you'd never stop crying.

01:35:36.653 --> 01:35:39.031
I feel I had nothing to do with that,
but I will take it.

01:35:39.114 --> 01:35:41.575
As far as men go?
He's way stupider than I am.

01:35:41.658 --> 01:35:44.745
You do realize I'm standing right here
and I can hear you?

01:35:44.828 --> 01:35:46.246
Yeah, well, I pointed at you.

01:35:46.330 --> 01:35:49.333
Listen up. You're not sick.
You need to tell him what's going on.

01:35:49.416 --> 01:35:50.792
- No, I don't.
- I will be outside.

01:35:50.876 --> 01:35:53.295
- Can you please come back?
- We're not going to be late!

01:35:53.378 --> 01:35:54.922
All right.

01:35:56.006 --> 01:35:59.009
- Nick, you're not sick, buddy.
- Oh, I feel very ill.

01:35:59.092 --> 01:36:01.678
- Right. You're heartbroken, bro.
- No, I'm not.

01:36:01.762 --> 01:36:04.806
- Yeah, you are.
- No, I'm not.

01:36:06.517 --> 01:36:10.145
- Where do you think the money came from?
- I don't know. Where did...? What?

01:36:10.229 --> 01:36:12.773
- The loan that saved your ass.
- Yes?

01:36:12.856 --> 01:36:16.735
- The hotel you named after another woman?
- What about it?

01:36:16.818 --> 01:36:19.655
Remember
that mysterious private lender, Nick?

01:36:20.822 --> 01:36:23.951
Lucy convinced Eva Woolf
to float you the money, man.

01:36:24.034 --> 01:36:26.995
She saved your ass.
It's like she's your knight in shining armor

01:36:27.079 --> 01:36:29.289
and you're the stupidest princess
I have ever met.

01:36:29.373 --> 01:36:31.917
No. You know what?
I'm not a stupid princess. Take these.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:35.003
I didn't mean it literally.
Don't take offense.

01:36:35.087 --> 01:36:37.673
Oh, so I'll just pay for this...?

01:36:54.189 --> 01:36:57.442
I can't believe you did this
with your crazy.

01:36:57.526 --> 01:36:59.570
My crazy is beautiful.

01:36:59.653 --> 01:37:01.446
Crazy beautiful.

01:37:02.447 --> 01:37:05.450
I mean, team spirit or... What?
I don't know. Where's Jeff?

01:37:05.534 --> 01:37:09.997
I hate him. I love him. I mean, I hate him.
What are you doing to me?

01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:11.623
How's this?

01:37:11.707 --> 01:37:14.001
- My body's not rejecting it.
- No?

01:37:14.084 --> 01:37:15.252
No, that's too much. Don't.

01:38:14.186 --> 01:38:16.647
Hello, hoarders and art freaks.

01:38:16.730 --> 01:38:19.274
Welcome to the Broken Heart Gallery.

01:38:21.777 --> 01:38:25.155
Yes! Yes.

01:38:25.239 --> 01:38:28.909
This gallery does not have
hundred-thousand-dollar paintings

01:38:28.992 --> 01:38:30.869
or precious sculptures.

01:38:30.953 --> 01:38:35.290
It has... crap. A lot of it.

01:38:36.291 --> 01:38:39.253
But these are the things we keep,

01:38:39.336 --> 01:38:43.841
the souvenirs that tell the stories
of our lives,

01:38:43.924 --> 01:38:47.094
even if that is a half-eaten crab cake.

01:38:50.806 --> 01:38:52.975
- Hey, I need that order.
- I thought you canceled it.

01:38:53.058 --> 01:38:55.978
- Yeah. Can you un-cancel it?
- Yeah.

01:38:56.061 --> 01:38:57.771
I began collecting

01:38:57.855 --> 01:39:01.108
because I lost someone a long time ago.

01:39:02.067 --> 01:39:05.696
Her body is still here,
but her memory is gone.

01:39:07.614 --> 01:39:10.242
<i>So, in many ways, she is gone too.</i>

01:39:11.243 --> 01:39:13.287
My mother was my first heartbreak.

01:39:14.997 --> 01:39:21.086
I was afraid I would end up like her,
that I would forget and be forgotten.

01:39:22.254 --> 01:39:26.967
<i>So I clung to things,
which kept me from moving forward.</i>

01:39:27.968 --> 01:39:31.930
Heartbreak is the loneliest,
most isolating feeling in the world.

01:39:32.014 --> 01:39:34.892
<i>And the truth is, it happens to us all.</i>

01:39:36.018 --> 01:39:38.353
It is the great equalizer.

01:39:39.479 --> 01:39:43.483
And without heartbreak,
I wouldn't have built this place.

01:39:44.484 --> 01:39:49.907
So, I guess, in the end,
the thing that broke me...

01:39:49.990 --> 01:39:51.783
also made me whole.

01:39:51.867 --> 01:39:55.829
Lucy! Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry.

01:39:57.289 --> 01:39:58.415
Sorry.

01:39:58.498 --> 01:40:00.250
Okay.

01:40:02.002 --> 01:40:03.587
Lucy.

01:40:05.422 --> 01:40:08.467
So I'd like to direct your attention
to some of the installations...

01:40:08.550 --> 01:40:10.260
Lucy!

01:40:11.345 --> 01:40:14.348
Well, this is awkward.

01:40:14.431 --> 01:40:16.600
Nick! What are you doing?

01:40:16.683 --> 01:40:20.687
What does it look like?
It's... It's a grand gesture.

01:40:22.814 --> 01:40:24.316
This is kind of a bad time.

01:40:24.399 --> 01:40:27.444
If you just wanna wait patiently, quietly,
until I'm done...

01:40:27.528 --> 01:40:29.196
No. No, I can't do that.

01:40:32.115 --> 01:40:33.909
The map was mine.

01:40:35.702 --> 01:40:37.621
- Wait. What?
- The map.

01:40:38.622 --> 01:40:41.834
I put the map in here. I know I said he...

01:40:42.835 --> 01:40:46.380
<i>It's kind of random. I don't know.
I was just trying to throw you off.</i>

01:40:46.463 --> 01:40:50.884
I met Chloe working at a hotel.
And she was...

01:40:50.968 --> 01:40:52.469
I fell in love with her.

01:40:53.595 --> 01:40:56.181
And then she left me for my boss.

01:40:57.182 --> 01:40:58.433
And I was devastated.

01:40:59.434 --> 01:41:03.897
And I promised myself that I would never
let anyone make me feel that way again.

01:41:04.898 --> 01:41:06.400
And then I met you.

01:41:07.401 --> 01:41:13.323
And so I put the map on the wall
because I wanted to see you again.

01:41:16.702 --> 01:41:19.121
Could have just asked me
to dinner or something.

01:41:19.204 --> 01:41:21.790
- Yeah. In hindsight.
- Next time.

01:41:21.874 --> 01:41:23.834
Probably. Good thing, you know?

01:41:25.335 --> 01:41:31.466
But love makes you do crazy,
stupid, irrational things, and...

01:41:31.550 --> 01:41:37.681
And I guess what I'm trying to say,
Lucy, is I love you.

01:41:49.776 --> 01:41:52.196
Try it again. Try it again.

01:41:52.279 --> 01:41:54.198
I love you, Lucy.

01:41:54.281 --> 01:41:57.367
Yeah, I heard you.
Gonna get back to my speech now.

01:41:59.786 --> 01:42:01.079
Maybe I should just...

01:42:01.163 --> 01:42:03.957
- You should stay.
- Sort of awkward that you're not...

01:42:04.041 --> 01:42:05.667
Oh, my God.

01:42:05.751 --> 01:42:07.586
Love him back! Right?

01:42:07.669 --> 01:42:13.175
- Yeah, I think you should love him back.
- You should love him back.

01:42:13.258 --> 01:42:17.513
I know that was sweet, but you don't know
what the context is, so...

01:42:17.596 --> 01:42:19.598
- Love him back.
- Love him back!

01:42:19.681 --> 01:42:24.353
- <i>Love him back! Love him back!</i>
- Oh, we're chanting? We're chanting now.

01:42:24.436 --> 01:42:28.148
- <i>Love him back! Love him back!</i>
- Whoa, okay. Okay, this is...

01:42:28.232 --> 01:42:31.193
<i>Love him back! Love him back!</i>

01:42:31.276 --> 01:42:34.488
Okay, enough! Be quiet.

01:42:46.917 --> 01:42:51.088
Just... Excuse me. Thank you, excuse me.

01:42:57.261 --> 01:42:58.095
Hi.

01:42:59.096 --> 01:43:02.349
I'm a lump of coal. I feel nothing.

01:43:07.104 --> 01:43:09.773
{\an8}I changed the name of the hotel.

01:43:10.858 --> 01:43:13.110
{\an8}It's no big deal.

01:43:20.742 --> 01:43:25.664
Okay, if I didn't do this, they would
all turn on me, so this is for them.

01:43:35.883 --> 01:43:39.011
You're the only person
I didn't collect anything from.

01:43:40.012 --> 01:43:40.846
Why's that?

01:43:41.847 --> 01:43:44.558
Because I love you too.

01:43:45.809 --> 01:43:48.061
Okay, okay.

01:44:51.834 --> 01:44:56.755
Okay. Hi. Okay...

01:44:58.799 --> 01:45:01.718
This is the bottle
from the first whiskey we shared together.

01:45:01.802 --> 01:45:06.807
And this is the pen Lucy used
to defile my hotel,

01:45:08.183 --> 01:45:12.271
and this is the hotel room key from
when Lucy and I first started connecting...

01:45:12.354 --> 01:45:13.981
What are you doing?

01:45:14.064 --> 01:45:17.943
I'm doing the thing about the stuff,
you know, that the other people did.

01:45:18.944 --> 01:45:20.779
I'm sorry. She has no manners.

01:45:20.863 --> 01:45:24.116
Okay, that's cute, but you don't need this

01:45:24.199 --> 01:45:26.118
because we're never breaking up.

01:45:26.201 --> 01:45:27.619
Not even in a zombie apocalypse.

01:45:27.703 --> 01:45:30.372
I'm sorry, he's such a hoarder.

01:45:30.455 --> 01:45:34.209
We don't use that term. It's derogatory.

01:45:34.293 --> 01:45:36.920
No, taught you so well.
