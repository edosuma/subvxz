00:35.800 --> 00:38.804
LOU: Whose fucking phone is on?

00:39.960 --> 00:41.140
MAN: Uh, we're going
to just touch you up.

00:41.240 --> 00:42.969
- Okay, Mr. Dorchen?
- Hey.

00:43.640 --> 00:45.180
Do I need nipple rouge?

00:45.280 --> 00:46.660
MAN: Uh, can we get... I don't, uh...

00:46.760 --> 00:48.524
Do I need any nipple rouge?

00:48.800 --> 00:50.980
MAN: Yeah.
Touch up his nipples, please.

What kind of brush is that?
Is that rabbit fur?

NARRATOR: Lou Dorchen,
the legendary lead singer

00:57.400 --> 00:59.323
of metal supergroup Motley Lue,

00:59.480 --> 01:01.960
who burst onto the world stage
out of nowhere

01:02.120 --> 01:04.540
to become the very definition
of a rock god.

01:04.640 --> 01:07.803
Livin' the dream with
high school sweetheart Kelly Dorchen.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.860
So how did the ultimate party
animal get the inspiration

01:10.960 --> 01:13.180
to build the most innovative,
forward-thinking

01:13.280 --> 01:15.020
tech company in the world?

01:15.120 --> 01:18.220
I don't have to tell you where I got
my inspiration from, first of all.

01:18.320 --> 01:20.900
Because that's called
"intellectual property"

01:21.000 --> 01:22.540
and I can copyright that shit.

01:22.640 --> 01:24.404
Just like I copyrighted the word "well,"

01:24.520 --> 01:26.761
so you can't even say "well"
without paying me money.

01:27.680 --> 01:29.540

- You owe me money.

Ever since I wrote Let's Get It Started
back in '86,

01:37.280 --> 01:38.327
I've been on a roll.

01:38.520 --> 01:41.740
Uh, MMMBop, triple platinum.

01:41.840 --> 01:44.580
A lot of stations still playin'
Gin and Juicey Juice.

01:44.680 --> 01:47.684
You Oughta Know.
Feelin' Like Teen Spirit.

01:47.840 --> 01:49.649
I guess you could say
I take from a lot of artists.

01:50.160 --> 01:52.686
Take my inspiration
from a lot of artists.

01:52.880 --> 01:53.881
I don't...

01:54.120 --> 01:56.964
I don't take their stuff.

01:57.120 --> 01:59.248
That's... Who would do that?

01:59.480 --> 02:01.940
- Yeah. Ask me anything.
- MAN: Okay. (CLEARS THROAT)

his own place in the world,

02:08.199 --> 02:11.647
Jacob Dorchen comments on his
father's game-changing innovation.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.083
He didn't invent Goo... Lougle.

02:15.400 --> 02:17.940
He couldn't invent his way
out of a fucking paper bag.

02:18.040 --> 02:20.540
And that's...
That's not a turn of phrase,

02:20.640 --> 02:22.300
that's anecdotal evidence.

02:22.400 --> 02:25.085
He got caught in a giant paper
bag a couple weeks ago.

02:25.240 --> 02:27.402
Adam... Adam Yates.
Yes, he rounds out

02:27.960 --> 02:29.500
our Three Musketeerposse.

02:29.600 --> 02:31.500
He made it real big
with his bestselling novel,

02:31.600 --> 02:33.250
Jacuzzi Timelord.

02:33.560 --> 02:37.565
But Adam, he's, uh...
He's off on an experiential journey.

02:38.080 --> 02:39.923
I got a feeling we'll see him again.

02:42.200 --> 02:43.300
I got a feeling.

02:48.600 --> 02:49.761

02:49.920 --> 02:51.780
NARRATOR:
One fateful ski trip in 1986

02:51.880 --> 02:54.247
seemed to kick-start
their lives into high gear.

02:54.360 --> 02:57.420
But what was it like to grow up
alongside these future stars?

02:57.520 --> 02:59.727
We turned to high school pal,
Gary Winkle.

02:59.840 --> 03:02.200
I bet you guys didn't know that I was
supposed to go on that trip, huh?

03:02.960 --> 03:04.620
- I stood outside all day...
- (WHIMPERS)

03:04.720 --> 03:07.724
...but they never showed.
Left me hanging.

03:08.120 --> 03:09.540
You know what I got that weekend?

03:09.640 --> 03:11.620
Chlamydia from the batting cages.

03:11.720 --> 03:14.180
My best buddies go up
the mountain as regular Joes.

03:14.280 --> 03:17.602
Come down fucking rich.
I mean, how did that happen?

03:18.000 --> 03:19.420
I mean, at the end of the day,

03:19.520 --> 03:21.340
I'm just a simple guy like you

03:21.440 --> 03:23.568
who had a couple of great ideas

03:23.680 --> 03:26.060
that happen to make him
a bunch of money. That's it.

03:26.160 --> 03:28.527
I mean, how was I supposed to know

03:28.680 --> 03:31.860
that it would change the fabric
of our existence? I couldn't.

03:31.960 --> 03:35.681
You know, I couldn't,
unless I had some sort of...

For your information,
today I recorded an original piece.

04:58.480 --> 04:59.460
Really?

04:59.560 --> 05:01.050
Okay, it was that Lisa Loeb song.

05:01.160 --> 05:02.764
Well, as much of it as I could remember.

05:02.880 --> 05:04.405
The lyrics I made up were original.

05:04.720 --> 05:07.540
Listen, Nick, I get it.
You don't have any natural talent.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.460
All I know is that hot tub
made me a king.

05:09.560 --> 05:11.300
It's my duty to live up to the throne.

05:11.400 --> 05:12.580
All right, I can't see you right now,

05:12.680 --> 05:15.365
but I'm gonna assume you're putting
"king" and "throne" in quotes.

05:17.280 --> 05:18.300
What do you want?

05:18.400 --> 05:21.020
Hey, Nick, I'm sorry.
I'm not trying to be a dick.

05:21.120 --> 05:22.167
Are you coming to Lou's party?

05:22.440 --> 05:25.649
I gotta talk to Courtney.
I'm... I don't know.

05:25.760 --> 05:27.364
- How is Courtney?
- You know.

05:27.480 --> 05:29.220
Oh, really? Still fighting, huh?

05:29.320 --> 05:31.060

on me like that, huh?

Knock on something.

05:48.440 --> 05:50.740
You took most of the doors out
and put beads up, Lou.

It's not really my birthday.

Okay.

The sooner you choke to death on it,
the sooner I get all this.

06:39.480 --> 06:41.881
Any other questions,
or is this interview over?

06:44.720 --> 06:47.963

hit you on the way out.

That's my butler.

06:53.240 --> 06:54.890

Lisa Loeb?

07:00.320 --> 07:02.500
Oh, my God. I can't believe
Nick Webber knows

07:02.600 --> 07:03.886
the name of the cat wrangler.

07:04.280 --> 07:05.645
Yeah. Crazy, right?

07:05.920 --> 07:08.605
You know, I just have to tell you,
I really love this song so much.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.563
- It feels so personal.
- Mmm.

07:10.800 --> 07:12.928
It's almost... Violating.

07:15.640 --> 07:17.244

Yeah. Brad, do your thing.

Ladies and gentlemen,

We did it, guys!
We got to the crossroads!

07:59.800 --> 08:02.644
Our competitors,
Lycos and GeoCities, are crushing us.

(CHUCKLES) What about Yahoo, huh?
Where are they?

08:06.640 --> 08:07.971
Yahoo? What's Yahoo?

08:08.160 --> 08:09.300
Exactly.

08:09.400 --> 08:11.500
As your head of R&D, I have to tell you

08:11.600 --> 08:13.728
that Lougle cannot continue
down this path.

08:13.840 --> 08:15.980
Well, that's why I moved us
to New Orleans, Brad,

a dick and balls this time.

I swear to God. Look, look, look!

08:29.720 --> 08:33.042

You looked at a dick and balls!

08:33.159 --> 08:34.400
I burned you.

08:34.840 --> 08:36.330
(CHUCKLES)

08:36.520 --> 08:39.284
I can't believe I let you talk me
into joining this sinking ship.

08:39.400 --> 08:41.926
I was one of Engineering
Quarterly's "30 Under 30."

08:42.120 --> 08:43.340
Really?

08:43.440 --> 08:45.100
I was on track to be "20 Under 40,"

08:45.200 --> 08:47.362
but now I'm "Zero Under Fuck Me"!

08:47.640 --> 08:48.926
You fucked me, Lou.

08:49.080 --> 08:50.620
You fucked my whole life.

Okay, okay.
Looks like you're hungry for an idea.

So why doesn't Uncle Lou give
you guys a little taste, huh?

09:08.160 --> 09:10.940
If you combine the right
amounts of nitrotrinadium

09:11.040 --> 09:15.090
with specifically heated water
in a specialized basin,

22:29.080 --> 22:30.081
What?

22:30.280 --> 22:32.886
Alternate universe. Like Fringe.

22:33.600 --> 22:34.620
BOTH: (SINGING) Nerd

22:34.720 --> 22:37.380
You're a fucking nerd

22:37.480 --> 22:38.527
Nerd

22:38.640 --> 22:40.980
You're a fucking nerd

22:41.080 --> 22:43.560
- Nerd
- And no one likes you

22:43.680 --> 22:44.620
Poindexter

22:44.720 --> 22:45.780
No one likes you

22:45.880 --> 22:47.940
FEMALE AUTOMATED VOICE:
Media preferences, Mr. Dorchen?

22:48.040 --> 22:49.041
Hello?

22:49.280 --> 22:51.965
Media preferences, Mr. Dorchen?

22:52.440 --> 22:54.124
Duck Dynasty?

22:54.320 --> 22:56.607
Media preferences, Mr. Dorchen?

22:56.760 --> 22:58.888
Duck Fucking Dynasty!

22:59.360 --> 23:01.044
Just try "the news."

23:01.200 --> 23:03.380
News selected.
Thank you, Mr. Dorchen.

23:03.480 --> 23:05.846
MALE ANNOUNCER 1: Tune in tomorrow
for the challenge round.

23:06.040 --> 23:09.123
Eat a boot? Eat your feelings.
Choozy Doozy.

23:09.320 --> 23:11.209
I think I may be Mr. Dorchen.

23:11.320 --> 23:12.820
- What? No.
- I think this is my house.

23:12.920 --> 23:14.684
- No way.
- I think he's right, Lou.

23:14.880 --> 23:15.961
- That's impossible.
- You heard it.

23:16.080 --> 23:17.491
- It just answered me.
- Uh-uh!

23:17.680 --> 23:19.460
MALE ANNOUNCER 2: March 26, 2025.

23:19.560 --> 23:22.460
From Comedy Central's World News
headquarters in New York.com,

23:22.560 --> 23:24.847
this is The Daily Show
with Jessica Williams.

23:24.960 --> 23:26.007
2025.

23:26.840 --> 23:28.460
(AUDIENCE CHEERING ON TV)

23:28.560 --> 23:31.900
Hey! Welcome to The Daily Show.
I'm Jessica Williams.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.340
Tonight's guest, Dame Jennifer Lawrence

23:34.440 --> 23:37.683
promoting her Meryl Streep
biopic, Streepin' It Real.

23:37.840 --> 23:40.525
Hey, how do they get the people
to be on this show?

23:40.840 --> 23:42.940
So, by now you've all seen
the NSA satellite footage

23:43.040 --> 23:44.460
of the road rage incident

23:44.560 --> 23:47.803
between two self-driving
smart cars in New Detroit.

23:48.000 --> 23:52.287
President Neil Patrick Harris has called
for greater regulation of the industry,

23:52.760 --> 23:55.660
while congressional Republicans defend
every sentient automobile's

23:55.760 --> 23:58.340
constitutional right
to shoot a black car

23:58.440 --> 23:59.771
if it's actin' funny.

23:59.880 --> 24:01.120
(LAUGHS)

24:01.640 --> 24:03.100
This show's still got it.

24:03.200 --> 24:06.886
Holy shit.
We went 10 years into the future.

24:11.440 --> 24:12.566
Whoa.

24:13.120 --> 24:15.202
I'm distinguished.

24:15.560 --> 24:17.801
Oh, I should shave this, right?

24:17.960 --> 24:19.580
Yeah, that's not a good look.

24:19.680 --> 24:21.409
This is so smooth,
I don't think I went bald.

24:21.520 --> 24:22.540
I think this is a choice,

24:22.640 --> 24:24.961
like Andre Agassi
or Bruce Willis or something.

24:25.160 --> 24:27.460
You don't look anything like
either of those two people.

24:27.560 --> 24:31.007
For one, they're fit and handsome
and you're neither of those things.

24:31.120 --> 24:32.929
You look like a turtle
crawled out of his shell.

24:33.040 --> 24:34.620
Fuck you for making me bald.

24:34.720 --> 24:37.380
You look like
an orchestra conductor for stray cats.

24:37.480 --> 24:39.860
You look like you give
lectures on public access.

24:39.960 --> 24:41.724
You look like a grown-up Gerber baby.

24:42.160 --> 24:44.640
LOU: You look like an egg
gave birth to another egg.

24:44.760 --> 24:46.220
You look like Gandalf the Poor.

24:46.320 --> 24:47.260
(CHUCKLES)

24:47.360 --> 24:49.488
You look like
you advise Lando Calrissian.

24:49.600 --> 24:50.540
That's a good one.

24:50.640 --> 24:53.081
You look like the guy that owns
the one house that ruins the whole street.

24:53.200 --> 24:54.980
Have I bombed anything, you think?

24:55.080 --> 24:57.060
You look like
you've never made a correct decision.

24:57.160 --> 24:58.286
Ever.

24:58.440 --> 25:01.125
I have definitely given
a back-alley blowjob.

25:01.320 --> 25:04.563
- I gotta admit I kinda like this.
- I want to hit you into the corner pocket.

25:04.720 --> 25:07.420
Now I know why the coat-check
girl didn't like me.

25:07.520 --> 25:09.329
I look like fucking shit.

25:13.880 --> 25:16.380
So far so good on this future shit, huh?

25:16.480 --> 25:17.940
Yeah. You know what?

25:18.040 --> 25:20.281
I don't feel like anything
bad's going to happen.

25:20.880 --> 25:21.860
Uh-oh.

25:21.960 --> 25:24.460
Hey, check it out. I found all
the gear from the painting.

25:24.560 --> 25:25.580
- Cool, huh?
- Whoa.

25:25.680 --> 25:27.045
(LAUGHING)

25:28.160 --> 25:29.764
What happened
to the bottom of your suit?

25:29.880 --> 25:31.325
That pesky little doggie eat it?

25:31.680 --> 25:33.125
It's called fashion, Lou.

25:33.520 --> 25:34.521
You look like...

25:34.720 --> 25:36.780
- Nope, not doing anymore "You look like."
- But you look like...

25:36.880 --> 25:38.020
I don't give a shit.
We did it on the stairs.

25:38.120 --> 25:40.531
We did it in front of the mirror.
It'd be tacky to do it a third time.

25:40.720 --> 25:42.540
Anyway, do you guys
want some fresh clothes?

25:42.640 --> 25:43.980
I got a whole closet full of stuff.

25:44.080 --> 25:46.140
I love this shirt. My shit is fly.

25:46.240 --> 25:48.208
Weren't you listening
to my speech, dude?

25:48.440 --> 25:50.169
Always pack a bag.

25:51.720 --> 25:53.290
Hey, is that...

25:54.520 --> 25:55.780
- No. It is not.
- How did you get that?

25:55.880 --> 25:57.260
- I didn't get...
- I know what it...

25:57.360 --> 25:58.566
I saw what it said.

25:58.800 --> 25:59.940
It doesn't say anything!

26:00.040 --> 26:01.180
Was that the Cincinnati box?

26:01.280 --> 26:02.566
(BOTH SHUSHING)

26:02.720 --> 26:05.246
- Don't say that out loud.
- It might hear you.

26:05.440 --> 26:07.408
You're really never
going to tell me what's inside that box?

26:07.720 --> 26:10.451
Okay, we'll tell you. We'll tell him.

26:10.880 --> 26:12.405
- I'm going to tell him.
- NICK: Lou.

26:12.600 --> 26:15.260
It's the Declaration of Independence
with a map on the back.

26:15.360 --> 26:17.408
- Our family's chosen.
- Yep.

26:17.720 --> 26:19.420
That's just the plot of that
movie National Treasure.

26:19.520 --> 26:20.521
It's the Ark of the Covenant.

26:20.680 --> 26:22.860
That's Raiders of the Lost Ark.
You're not even tryin'.

26:22.960 --> 26:24.769
I mean, that's not even
anything that could be in the box.

26:24.880 --> 26:26.540
Okay, this has gone on long enough.

26:26.640 --> 26:27.660
Okay.

26:27.760 --> 26:31.731
It's a ring that turns you invisible
and carries with it the power of evil.

26:31.840 --> 26:34.366
I've seen fucking movies,
you guys! I've seen movies!

26:34.480 --> 26:36.380
Wait, why are you alive?

26:36.480 --> 26:37.500
What?

26:37.600 --> 26:39.380
Why are you alive? We're in the future.

26:39.480 --> 26:41.100
Yeah, you know what? He's right.

26:41.200 --> 26:43.009
'Cause if we went back in time,
you'd be alive.

26:43.120 --> 26:44.820
But we went 10 years
in the fuckin' future.

26:44.920 --> 26:46.046
You should be dead.

26:46.240 --> 26:47.605
Yeah, what the fuck?

26:47.760 --> 26:49.420
What you should be
asking yourselves is,

26:49.520 --> 26:51.140
- "When the fuck?"
- (ALL GASPING)

26:51.240 --> 26:53.129
God damn it!

26:53.280 --> 26:54.620
This fucking guy again!

26:54.720 --> 26:55.721
Why do you do that?

26:55.960 --> 26:57.564
LOU: He's not going to tell us anything.

26:57.760 --> 27:00.081
Hey, why don't you make like a fuck off
and get out of here?

27:00.240 --> 27:04.040
Wait. So all we have to do is go back
and Lou's gonna be okay, right?

27:04.640 --> 27:07.120
It's not that simple, really.

27:07.280 --> 27:09.362
The hot tub doesn't take you
where you want to go.

27:09.480 --> 27:10.860
It takes you where you need to go.

27:10.960 --> 27:11.961
Come on!

27:12.080 --> 27:15.820
There are
certain calculations and innovations

27:15.920 --> 27:19.129
and salutations that haven't
even come to pass yet.

27:19.440 --> 27:21.090
What the hell does that mean?

27:21.240 --> 27:24.528
What it means is, at the present,
your tub here is just a tub.

27:24.640 --> 27:27.166
Wait, are you saying
that time travel is not even possible?

27:27.320 --> 27:30.051
Right on, Liz.
Give the pretty lady a flower.

27:30.160 --> 27:31.491
- Damn it.
- Lizzie.

27:31.640 --> 27:33.620
That's bullshit, okay?

27:33.720 --> 27:36.564
We got a whole vault
of nitro right here. (GASPS)

27:37.080 --> 27:39.162
Where'd it go? Where did it go?

27:40.320 --> 27:42.004
What did you do with my nitro?

27:42.240 --> 27:44.925
How can I take what doesn't exist yet?

27:45.080 --> 27:47.447
It exists in the past.
How can it not exist in the future?

27:47.560 --> 27:50.166
The past, the future. All very cute.

27:50.400 --> 27:52.460
But who's to say the past
isn't anything more

27:52.560 --> 27:54.847
than the future of this present?

27:55.240 --> 27:56.940
So, nitro is from the future?

27:57.040 --> 27:58.060
(SIGHS)

27:58.160 --> 27:59.446
Like Terminator.

27:59.600 --> 28:00.980
- Yeah.
- Oh! Oh, my God.

28:01.080 --> 28:03.082
You think everything is like Terminator.

28:03.200 --> 28:04.850
'Cause everything is like Terminator!

28:04.960 --> 28:07.008
Arnold's hand gets
chopped off in the past,

28:07.120 --> 28:10.203
somebody finds it, reverse
engineers that shit. Boom!

28:10.320 --> 28:12.620
Terminators running all
around this motherfucker.

28:12.720 --> 28:14.006
That's how we got nitro?

28:14.480 --> 28:16.687
I don't know. I never saw Terminator.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.048
Oh, fuck this guy and his riddles!

28:20.200 --> 28:21.964
- (VOCALIZING)
- (GRUNTS)

28:27.000 --> 28:28.604
Thanks for holding him down for me!

28:28.760 --> 28:29.740
"Hold him down"?

28:29.840 --> 28:31.740
So you can beat to death
the mystical time baron

28:31.840 --> 28:33.330
that holds the keys
to our very existence?

28:33.440 --> 28:34.980
That's your fucking plan here?

28:35.080 --> 28:36.206
(SCOFFS) Shut up.

28:36.360 --> 28:37.780
Tighten your shit up, Lou.
We needed him.

28:37.880 --> 28:39.041
Amateur hour.

28:39.800 --> 28:41.370
This thing is awesome.

28:41.520 --> 28:42.820
I probably invented it.

28:42.920 --> 28:44.843
"Lou Sux

28:45.080 --> 28:49.244
"Cox N Dix." Flip it.
(LAUGHS)

28:49.920 --> 28:50.921
Okay.

28:51.360 --> 28:52.620
Try to stay with me.

28:52.720 --> 28:54.563
This is going to get complicated.

28:54.680 --> 28:56.648
This is time.

28:57.200 --> 28:58.201
(LOU GROANS)

28:58.320 --> 28:59.526
And you're dead.

28:59.680 --> 29:01.569
So Lou is killed in our present,

29:01.680 --> 29:04.300
which means that here,
in the future, he should still be dead.

29:04.400 --> 29:05.561
Well, clearly, he's not fuckin' dead,

29:05.680 --> 29:07.569
'cause he's sittin' here,
still bothering me.

29:07.680 --> 29:09.100
So what that tells me is

29:09.200 --> 29:10.820
we're in a completely different future

29:10.920 --> 29:13.400
on a completely different timeline.

29:13.520 --> 29:16.091
Jacob, I'm the Sarlacc.

29:16.400 --> 29:17.380
(VOCALIZING)

29:17.480 --> 29:18.460
JACOB: Okay.

29:18.560 --> 29:20.244
Anyway, the Repairman said

29:20.360 --> 29:24.843
that the past is actually the future
of the present we're in right now.

29:25.360 --> 29:29.410
So I think what that means is
the killer is from the future.

29:29.880 --> 29:33.202
So clearly, someone from 2025
will go back in time and shoot Lou.

29:33.440 --> 29:34.771
Like Looper.

29:35.040 --> 29:36.121
Wow!

29:36.560 --> 29:38.340
How about a fucking spoiler alert?

29:38.440 --> 29:40.540
"Hey, Lou, you want to go see Looper?"

29:40.640 --> 29:42.449
"Nah, I got a thing I gotta do."

29:42.640 --> 29:44.404
It's in my queue! That counts.

29:44.520 --> 29:46.409
It's the first Bruce Willis
movie we missed.

29:46.520 --> 29:48.010
- Is Bruce in that?
- JACOB: Okay.

29:48.120 --> 29:51.860
Plainly, just by virtue of
Lou being here alive in 2025

29:51.960 --> 29:54.327
when we know that he died in 2015,

29:54.600 --> 29:56.220
we're here to stop his future murder.

29:56.320 --> 29:59.020
- Which happens in the past.
- Exactly.

29:59.120 --> 30:00.121
I get this shit.

30:00.240 --> 30:02.020
I'm bored by this shit.

30:02.120 --> 30:04.380
Let's go check out the future
strip club situation.

30:04.480 --> 30:05.481
High five.

30:05.680 --> 30:07.380
Did you just say "high five"
instead of high-fiving?

30:07.480 --> 30:08.811
- High five.
- High five.

30:09.080 --> 30:10.860
That is the laziest thing
I've ever heard.

30:10.960 --> 30:11.900
High five.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.570
You don't have the energy for this?

30:13.960 --> 30:16.220
No, no.
You guys, we can't just fuck around.

30:16.320 --> 30:17.580
We got to find your murderer.

30:17.680 --> 30:19.580
Or we don't have to do any of that

30:19.680 --> 30:21.569
and we go check out a strip club.

30:21.840 --> 30:22.762
(BUZZING)

30:22.880 --> 30:23.900
Oh!

30:24.000 --> 30:26.180
- You flickered.
- Ah, you're flickering.

30:26.280 --> 30:27.860
I flickered... Why am I flickering?

30:27.960 --> 30:29.020
By threatening your own existence.

30:29.120 --> 30:30.724
Have you listened to
anything I've been saying?

30:30.880 --> 30:32.609
I have not listened to any of it.

30:32.920 --> 30:35.540
- (SIGHS)
- God, okay, fine! Fine.

30:35.640 --> 30:39.167
We'll solve my stupid murder,
which hasn't happened yet.

30:41.120 --> 30:43.043
Or we can just go
to a strip club. (GASPS)

30:43.560 --> 30:44.540
Oh...

30:44.640 --> 30:46.660
All right, fine!
The fucking murder thing.

30:46.760 --> 30:49.604
(HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING)

31:04.440 --> 31:06.204
(BAND PLAYING JAZZ)

31:12.040 --> 31:14.646
Huh. Nothing's really changed.

31:14.800 --> 31:17.087
You'd figure after 10 years,
something would be different, right?

That's some sexy-ass

Do you or someone you love
have a problem with

31:30.320 --> 31:32.780
- heroin, speed, ice...
- Yes. Yeah.

31:35.440 --> 31:37.740
...Al Michaels' Revenge or cocaine?

First order of business,

31:39.000 --> 31:40.843
we get ourselves some
Al Michaels' Revenge, right?

31:40.960 --> 31:44.726
We can help put the "U"
back in "Reuvenate."

31:44.840 --> 31:47.446
We're still demonizing addiction, huh?
Like it's some kind of sickness.

31:47.840 --> 31:49.380

to hit rock bottom.

Who in the future
would want to kill you, Lou?

31:53.440 --> 31:54.740
I don't know.

31:54.840 --> 31:56.660
The only person who's ever
had any motivation

31:56.760 --> 31:58.524
to kill me has been me.

31:58.640 --> 32:01.120
I treat everyone with the
utmost respect and kindness.

32:01.240 --> 32:03.322
Lou, you tried to push me
down the stairs last week.

Oh, my God, it's you.

32:09.640 --> 32:10.846
Jacob is the murderer.

32:11.080 --> 32:13.367
I'm not the murderer. Come on.

32:13.840 --> 32:17.060
Oh, really? Because you seem to have
stepped right into my life.

32:17.160 --> 32:19.925
You always wanted to be
the one fucking that tiger!

32:20.080 --> 32:23.740
Lou, if I was going to fuckin' kill you,
I wouldn't use a gun, okay?

32:23.840 --> 32:27.820
I would spike your mid-morning cocktail
with a tasteless, but potent sedative.

32:27.920 --> 32:30.340
And, while you slept,
I would wait the nine hours

32:30.440 --> 32:32.820
for it to fully flush out of your system,
so there's no trace.

32:32.920 --> 32:37.209
And I would take you out into the Gulf
and feed you to a tiger shark.

32:37.320 --> 32:38.685
Damn, that's cold.

32:38.840 --> 32:40.580
But I wouldn't use a gun. (SCOFFS)

He'd know what to do.

32:59.240 --> 33:00.300
I saw his trench coat

33:00.400 --> 33:02.402
beside the hot tub time machine.

33:06.520 --> 33:08.045
Adam murdered me.

JACOB: Okay, so Adam shoots Lou,

33:10.440 --> 33:12.580
and then uses the hot tub
to escape somewhere in time.

33:12.680 --> 33:13.700

33:13.800 --> 33:15.780
Only in our fucked-up social circle
is that textbook.

33:15.880 --> 33:17.530
Why would Adam wanna shoot you?

33:17.640 --> 33:20.700
I don't know.
I've only been the best of friends to him.

- Guilty.

I'm Adam Yates Stedmeyer.

Okay, so you're married to my aunt,
which makes you my uncle.

34:24.360 --> 34:28.922
But that means that
you and I are first cousins.

- Great White Buffalo.

34:45.800 --> 34:47.540
Great White Buffalo. Yeah.

So this is him, right? This is my dad?

34:52.120 --> 34:53.100
So you never met him?

No, they broke up
before I was even born.

Oh.

34:56.040 --> 34:58.202
But you guys can introduce us.

34:58.360 --> 35:02.001
Yeah. See, the thing about that is,
it's complicated.

35:04.560 --> 35:06.403
everything happens for a reason?

- No.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.420
Call it destiny, or predestiny.

35:10.520 --> 35:12.060
I think it's "predestination."

35:12.160 --> 35:14.220
No, it's predestiny. I read a book.

35:14.320 --> 35:17.404
- Uh, was that book a dictionary?
- No, it was a book called Predestiny.

35:17.520 --> 35:18.980
Okay, I don't really give a shit.

35:19.080 --> 35:21.321
With predestiny, it dictates

35:21.520 --> 35:24.180
that there is a force or something
holding the strings

35:24.280 --> 35:25.620
and setting everything up

35:25.720 --> 35:28.724
just so they can be
knocked down perfectly

35:46.720 --> 35:49.200
I certainly didn't say
anything about the dress.

35:49.320 --> 35:50.420
Oh.

35:50.520 --> 35:52.500
I'm sorry. I didn't realize

come out of my nose.

- I had milk earlier.

out of a tree.

36:32.760 --> 36:34.180

I still like your music.

I know you've fallen on hard times.

Hard times?

36:40.440 --> 36:42.300
You're so poor now,
but I really like you still.

36:52.840 --> 36:53.780
What?

36:53.880 --> 36:54.900
Oh, I didn't tell you.

36:55.000 --> 36:56.900
- Jacob is my cousin.
- No.

- Don't you ever call me that.

36:59.440 --> 37:01.340
- ...Is my uncle.
- What?

37:01.440 --> 37:04.523
And they came here in a, uh...
What was it?

37:04.800 --> 37:06.040
BOTH: Hot tub time machine.

37:06.280 --> 37:07.300
That's right.

37:07.400 --> 37:08.420
Oh, okay.

37:08.520 --> 37:11.330
So I guess you came here
in hot tub time machine, too.

37:14.280 --> 37:15.281
Listen.

37:17.600 --> 37:19.887
- They're looking for my dad.
- What?

37:20.040 --> 37:22.100
- You have to go with them.
- Uh...

37:22.200 --> 37:24.780
Would you guys mind?
It would be really, really great

37:24.880 --> 37:26.340
to have my father at the wedding.

37:26.440 --> 37:27.460
Fuck that. Fuck that.

37:27.560 --> 37:29.340
No way in hell. No way in hell.

37:29.440 --> 37:30.580
You gotta let Adam go.

37:30.680 --> 37:32.900
I mean, this is exactly
the sort of thing that he needs.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.820
We've been together for 10 years.
He hardly ever goes out.

37:35.920 --> 37:37.331
He didn't even have a bachelor party.

37:37.440 --> 37:38.860
Honey, you're making me
seem a little stiff.

37:38.960 --> 37:39.940
Right.

37:40.040 --> 37:43.089
All right. Well, you have fun
and make good choices.

37:43.200 --> 37:45.020
- You're my best choice.
- You're my best choice.

37:45.120 --> 37:47.460
- No, you're my best choice.
- You're my bestest choice.

No, you're my best choice!

37:50.760 --> 37:53.331
You're. My. Best. Choice.

37:53.480 --> 37:55.244
- The fuck?
- Yeah, seriously.

37:55.600 --> 37:57.250
Guys, I'll be there in one second.

37:57.360 --> 38:00.170
BOTH: You're. My. Best. Choice.

38:00.640 --> 38:03.928
Uh, so you guys
are my dad's full-on bros, huh?

38:04.120 --> 38:05.500
I always wondered
what my dad's full-on bros

38:05.600 --> 38:08.460
would be like and now...
Now I totally know.

38:08.560 --> 38:11.086
'Cause we're getting
some serious hang-time.

Hey.

You know what, I feel like we are
going to have an unforgettably...

38:16.720 --> 38:18.580
Dude, where the fuck are we going?

38:18.680 --> 38:20.060
Oh. Well, my mom used
to live near here,

38:20.160 --> 38:23.448
so I figured we'd go by her old building
and see if we can find a clue.

38:23.600 --> 38:26.700
Okay! Well, there's a 50-50 chance
I might murder your dad,

- He's got a real serious drug problem.
- He got shot last night.

39:56.880 --> 39:58.882
- He's got that runt ball.
- His son hates him.

39:59.000 --> 40:00.300
That's fair to say, right?

40:00.400 --> 40:02.448
Yeah, yeah. He's a monster.

40:02.920 --> 40:04.570
I'd like to help him.

40:04.680 --> 40:06.205
(BOTH LAUGHING)

40:12.400 --> 40:15.370
Oh, hey, I'm sure you're sick of this,

40:15.840 --> 40:18.127
- but will you sign my Dick Pad?
- (WOMAN MOANING)

40:18.600 --> 40:20.700
JACOB: Oh, you put your dick in there!

40:20.800 --> 40:22.040
ADAM: It's a genius invention.

40:22.160 --> 40:23.969
I know, okay? I know.

40:24.120 --> 40:26.900
You put your whole mouth
inside your son's jerk-off machine.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.446
What does your son's penis taste like?

40:29.880 --> 40:31.020
Goddamn you.

40:31.120 --> 40:32.326
Was it delicious?

40:32.600 --> 40:35.220
Oh, hey, a friend of mine's some
sort a big shot over at Lougle.

40:35.320 --> 40:37.084
Brad Syed? He's coming to my wedding.

40:37.480 --> 40:38.481
- Brad?
- Hey.

40:38.920 --> 40:41.969
You guys should absolutely
come to my wedding.

40:42.160 --> 40:43.140
No.

40:43.240 --> 40:46.020
JACOB: Oh, man, I wish we could,
but we're doing, uh...

40:46.120 --> 40:47.929
Motherfucker!

40:48.400 --> 40:50.528
Gary Winkle.

40:51.560 --> 40:53.140
(ALL GASP)

40:53.240 --> 40:54.571
(FIRES)

41:01.160 --> 41:03.180
Fuck him in the face.
Right in the fucking face.

41:03.280 --> 41:05.009
It's not about money,
it's about making money.

41:05.280 --> 41:06.540
- Oh! Look who it...
- (GRUNTS)

41:06.640 --> 41:08.847
- Ahh!
- How are you rich, huh?

41:09.040 --> 41:11.088
How the fuck are you rich?

41:11.200 --> 41:12.780
- Oh, Lou...
- You killed me!

41:12.880 --> 41:14.882
I'm going to kill you
before you can kill me again!

41:15.040 --> 41:16.660
Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa...

41:16.760 --> 41:21.129
That's hilarious.
Why would I kill you? I love you, man.

41:21.600 --> 41:22.580
What?

41:22.680 --> 41:25.490
Okay, okay, okay. All right. I'm fine.

41:25.680 --> 41:26.806
You not buying that land

41:26.920 --> 41:28.968
was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

41:29.160 --> 41:30.460
Because when Hurricane Beth
came through

41:30.560 --> 41:32.780
and destroyed half the waterfront...
(EXHALES)

41:32.880 --> 41:36.407
It turned this worthless piece of dirt
into a goldmine.

41:36.600 --> 41:37.620
What?

41:37.720 --> 41:39.180
So you didn't murder me?

41:39.280 --> 41:42.727
What are you talking about?
I love you, man. (CHUCKLES)

41:44.320 --> 41:45.860
So, are you boys coming up or what?

41:45.960 --> 41:48.531
It's not a party unless
it's a Gary Winkle party.

41:48.640 --> 41:50.210
At Gary Winkle's.

41:50.680 --> 41:51.966
The Wink.

41:52.160 --> 41:54.401
- What are you doing?
- It's a double wink.

41:54.600 --> 41:55.620
Ah, technically, that's more of a blink.

41:55.720 --> 41:57.484
- That's a blink.
- You can't wink, can you?

41:57.600 --> 41:59.011
(SCOFFS) Of course I can wink.

41:59.160 --> 42:00.161
Prove it.

42:02.120 --> 42:03.121
Yeah.

42:03.560 --> 42:05.260
Let me do this. Hold on.

42:05.360 --> 42:07.488
Let me hold this open.
I'll hold this open.

42:07.920 --> 42:09.081
Now do it.

42:10.000 --> 42:10.940
BOTH: See?

42:11.040 --> 42:12.121
Can we go to the fuckin' party now?

42:12.440 --> 42:14.124
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

42:23.040 --> 42:24.530
Welcome to The Wink!

42:25.760 --> 42:27.888
Hey, jugglers, give my boys
anything they want...

42:28.640 --> 42:30.051
From that shelf down.

42:30.160 --> 42:32.580
- Lou, what are we doing here?
- You know.

42:32.680 --> 42:34.420
Winkle is not the killer. We gotta go.

42:34.520 --> 42:35.860
I don't care,
'cause there's cocaine right there.

42:35.960 --> 42:37.220
Didn't you see the cocaine?
Look, look, look.

42:37.320 --> 42:38.580
I see the cocaine. So what?

42:38.680 --> 42:40.420
Well, I'm going to do that.
So, first... And then...

42:40.520 --> 42:43.700
Look, I'm not flickering. Am I flickering?
You cannot say that I'm flickering.

42:43.800 --> 42:45.100
We're on a mission to save your life.

42:45.200 --> 42:46.929
You think I don't want
to roll my dick around some cocaine,

42:47.040 --> 42:48.140
- and get titty-slapped?
- Okay.

42:48.240 --> 42:50.460
Pop some bottles?
Do some crazy future shit?

42:50.560 --> 42:51.700
I'm trying to keep you from flickering.

42:51.800 --> 42:52.980
- What the fuck are you doing?
- LOU: Good talk.

42:53.080 --> 42:55.686
Thank you. And popping bottles,
that's old school.

42:55.800 --> 42:56.940
You bringing that back?

42:57.040 --> 42:58.180
- Yeah.
- (CHUCKLES)

42:58.280 --> 42:59.805
I like that. I like you.

43:00.200 --> 43:01.247
(SIGHS)

43:01.360 --> 43:02.340
Uh-oh.

43:02.440 --> 43:03.851
What are these?
I don't care.

43:04.560 --> 43:07.609
Oh. So, Nick, listen, I was so sorry
to hear about you and Courtney.

43:07.960 --> 43:10.167
- What do you mean?
- Ah.

43:10.400 --> 43:12.562
Gotcha. Forget I even brought it up.

43:12.720 --> 43:14.245
No, no, no, really, what do you mean?

43:14.400 --> 43:16.289
I hear you loud and clear, man.

43:16.960 --> 43:18.620
I don't think you hear me at all.

43:18.720 --> 43:20.020
Hey, Sophie!

43:20.120 --> 43:21.724
There you are.

43:25.680 --> 43:27.250
I have a surprise for you.

43:27.400 --> 43:28.561
Oh. Uh...

43:28.800 --> 43:31.087
Sophie has a surprise for me.

43:31.560 --> 43:32.686
Bye, dude!

43:34.480 --> 43:36.980
I'll take a room-temperature
almond milk, please.

43:37.080 --> 43:40.050
No, actually,
I'll get a tangerine margarita.

43:40.280 --> 43:41.566
No. Scratch that.

43:41.680 --> 43:45.620
I'll take just an apricot sliced into fours.
And a kiwi.

43:45.720 --> 43:48.405
Do you have kiwi?
I'll take a kiwi, sliced up.

43:48.520 --> 43:50.060
A banana thrown in there.

43:50.160 --> 43:51.780
You know what? Dealer's choice.

43:51.880 --> 43:53.120
Just a fruit salad.

43:57.360 --> 43:58.900
Should we go somewhere more private?

43:59.000 --> 44:00.340
(LAUGHS)

44:00.440 --> 44:02.522
Jacob Dorchen wants privacy.

44:02.720 --> 44:04.100
That's so 2018.

44:04.200 --> 44:05.201
Right, right.

44:05.680 --> 44:07.489
No. Get that out of here.

44:08.120 --> 44:10.500
I mean,
I wouldn't mind a little something.

44:10.600 --> 44:12.443
Remember, we agreed?

44:13.600 --> 44:14.860
Look at your dad.

44:14.960 --> 44:17.406
You're not going down
that road anymore.

44:20.840 --> 44:23.161
Oh, God, I'm so good at that!

44:23.440 --> 44:24.660
(GRUNTS) Yes!

44:24.760 --> 44:26.780
(VOCALIZING) It's Satan.

44:26.880 --> 44:28.300
Like, I'll finger your dog,
I don't care.

44:28.400 --> 44:30.050
As a joke! As a joke!

44:30.240 --> 44:31.401
I have some advice for you.

44:31.520 --> 44:33.780
If you don't want to be
considered a sex offender,

44:33.880 --> 44:36.180
don't take a shit in a sandbox

44:36.280 --> 44:38.100
that happens to be in a playground.

44:38.200 --> 44:40.380
Okay? Don't do it. 'Cause guess what?

44:40.480 --> 44:43.324
You have two things, a record
and a fucking nickname.

44:43.480 --> 44:46.500
I know it's a potentially risky move...
Wedding sorbet!

44:46.600 --> 44:48.300
- Mmm.
- As a palate cleanser, of course.

44:48.400 --> 44:49.447
I mean, I'm not insane.

44:49.840 --> 44:51.922
Oh, my God! Fuckin' A!
You're Nick Webber, man!

44:52.040 --> 44:54.380
Let's take a picture!
I can't believe it's you, man.

44:54.480 --> 44:55.460
I'm gonna send this to everyone.

44:55.560 --> 44:57.540
- I'm gonna get, like, a billion views!
- NICK: Okay.

44:57.640 --> 45:00.140
I remember when I first heard
that stupid song. I was like,

45:00.240 --> 45:02.641
"Man, that song is so dumb."

45:03.280 --> 45:04.406
Do the Strut.

45:04.520 --> 45:05.740
- Do the Strut.
- No, I'm good.

45:05.840 --> 45:06.966
You won't do the fucking song?

45:07.120 --> 45:08.980
- You want to see the Strut?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa...

45:09.080 --> 45:11.300
DJ: (LAUGHS) Hey, yo! Check this out!

45:11.400 --> 45:13.900
Nick Webber's in the house,
so get ready for the original

45:14.000 --> 45:16.128
- Webber Strut!
- (ALL CHEERING)

45:19.920 --> 45:21.660
Before that, let's back it up.

45:21.760 --> 45:24.081
Six years ago, see where it all began.

45:24.640 --> 45:27.530
I made a lot of mistakes.
I've taken advantage.

45:27.800 --> 45:30.280
And now I'm ready to be original.

45:30.520 --> 45:33.060
This is dedicated to
those who never got to be,

45:33.160 --> 45:34.491
because of me.

45:36.800 --> 45:39.121
Strut to the time of the clock

45:39.360 --> 45:42.762
It's midnight
Everybody strut right now

45:43.040 --> 45:44.780

Nick Webber

45:49.200 --> 45:50.440
You don't know, but you will

45:50.600 --> 45:54.571
Everybody do the
Strut, strut, strut

45:54.800 --> 45:58.885
Everybody do the
Strut, strut, strut

45:59.000 --> 46:00.180
Everybody do the

46:00.280 --> 46:01.725
(CROWD LAUGHING
AND APPLAUDING)

46:06.200 --> 46:09.010
(GASPS) Oh.

46:09.880 --> 46:13.521
Oh, this room is so much better
than the other room.

46:17.040 --> 46:18.041
What?

46:21.680 --> 46:22.681
No!

46:23.520 --> 46:25.887
Look at him go. Chip off the old block.

46:26.040 --> 46:27.420
(LAUGHS)

46:27.520 --> 46:28.660
Okay, be nice.

46:28.760 --> 46:32.260
Be nice. Be nice. Be nice.
Be nice. Be nice. Be nice.

46:32.360 --> 46:34.362
Hmm. Son!

46:34.840 --> 46:37.923
Hey! What a coincidence!

46:38.200 --> 46:41.204
Wondering where you ran off to,
but here you are.

46:41.480 --> 46:42.540
Who let you in here?

46:42.640 --> 46:44.060
Would you go find your murderer?

46:44.160 --> 46:48.020
Think your old man can get in
on a little of this action? Or...

46:48.120 --> 46:49.724
This is... This is a private party.

46:49.840 --> 46:51.171
This one's mine.

46:51.800 --> 46:53.325
What? Yes! See?

46:53.480 --> 46:54.481
Ha! Still got it!

46:54.880 --> 46:56.820
What are the, uh... house rules here?

46:56.920 --> 46:57.980
I just want to know what to do.

46:58.080 --> 47:01.801
I don't want to break any rules,
get chucked out right away, you know?

47:01.920 --> 47:04.161
- That'd be fucked up.
- Touch me, you filthy vagrant.

47:05.280 --> 47:06.691
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

47:09.040 --> 47:10.660
JACOB: (LAUGHS)
Oh! Wait, what was that?

47:10.760 --> 47:12.380
Nothing. It wasn't anything.

47:12.480 --> 47:13.481
You just flickered.

47:13.600 --> 47:14.900
No, I'd flickered? No, I didn't.

47:15.000 --> 47:15.980
How did you do that?

47:16.080 --> 47:17.500
He's threatening his own existence.

47:17.600 --> 47:20.780
Lou, you can't be here,
'cause you're jeopardizing your future.

47:20.880 --> 47:22.660
Would you mind
your own fucking beeswax?

47:22.760 --> 47:24.340
Whatever. I'm over this.

47:24.440 --> 47:26.820
No! No!

47:26.920 --> 47:28.922
No, no!

47:29.080 --> 47:30.525
(GROANS)

47:31.280 --> 47:34.820
Long story short, the caterer
did talk us into the Chateaubriand,

47:34.920 --> 47:37.340
which, you know,
I'll admit, is a sexy side of beef.

47:37.440 --> 47:38.380
Sounds like it.

47:38.480 --> 47:40.180
And I think you know
where I'm going with this.

47:40.280 --> 47:41.220
You thought wrong.

47:41.320 --> 47:44.180
Horseradish station. That's right. We're
gonna have the white and the reds,

47:44.280 --> 47:46.620
separate service, different intensity.

47:46.720 --> 47:48.290
It's gonna be great...

47:48.520 --> 47:49.806
Wait a second. Nick?

47:50.120 --> 47:52.340
- You should play our wedding.
- (SCOFFS)

47:52.440 --> 47:54.780
People would love to see the Strut
in person.

47:54.880 --> 47:56.060
I'm sure they would.

47:56.160 --> 47:57.980
Hey, what do you guys
want from the party tray?

47:58.080 --> 47:59.180
Me? Oh, uh...

47:59.280 --> 48:01.620
I don't know.
I'm getting married tomorrow,

48:01.720 --> 48:03.484
so I'm really trying to take it easy.

48:03.600 --> 48:05.020
Yeah, you're getting married
for the rest of your life,

48:05.120 --> 48:07.691
so why have any fun tonight at all?

48:09.120 --> 48:10.500
- Oh!
- Yeah.

48:10.600 --> 48:12.180
- Uncle Lou is right.
- Don't call me that.

48:12.280 --> 48:14.044
Give me the craziest thing you got.

48:14.160 --> 48:16.860
Someone sounds like he wants
the Electric Ladybug.

48:16.960 --> 48:18.020
Ooh, the Electric...

48:18.120 --> 48:19.220
- Oh.
- GARY: Stick it right there.

48:19.320 --> 48:21.300
What... I'm sorry, what exactly is that?

48:21.400 --> 48:22.380
(WOMAN SHUSHES)

48:22.480 --> 48:24.260
Don't take it off for 24 hours.

48:24.360 --> 48:26.931
Why can't I take it off for 24 hours?

48:27.280 --> 48:29.169
(BOTH LAUGHING)

48:29.320 --> 48:30.651
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

48:30.760 --> 48:32.460
Yeah. What's so funny?

48:32.560 --> 48:34.881
Relax. Relax.
It's just like baby aspirin.

48:35.000 --> 48:38.243
Except more of a super-high
intensity psychotropic drug trip.

48:39.080 --> 48:41.003
(CHUCKLING)

48:43.120 --> 48:44.540
(BELL TOLLING)

48:44.640 --> 48:46.085
I promise you,

48:47.520 --> 48:49.045
you're not gonna like this.

48:52.680 --> 48:53.681
(IN DISTORTED VOICE) Bye-bye.

48:54.680 --> 48:56.011
(TOLLING CONTINUES)

48:57.000 --> 48:58.365

ADAM: Hey, lick my pussy.

50:28.360 --> 50:30.761
Just kidding, guys.

- JACOB: What are you doing up there?
- Why are you down there, stupid fuck?

50:34.640 --> 50:38.125
You guys, last night, my eyes

50:39.280 --> 50:41.044

- Okay.

50:41.320 --> 50:43.209
I'm telling you, you guys,
you got to get up here.

50:43.640 --> 50:45.961

Mr. Webber.

Hi. I'm from Choozy Doozy.

- Yeah.

50:52.600 --> 50:53.761
NICK: How about that?

50:53.960 --> 50:57.965
Nick Webber has a show in 2025.
Still got it!

50:58.280 --> 51:01.170
Right, but, I mean, we can't go
because we have to solve his murder.

51:01.280 --> 51:03.780
Come on! Look. Hey, not flickering.

51:03.880 --> 51:05.620
Maybe it's a lead. It's a fun lead.

in time and kills you.

51:07.800 --> 51:08.847
I can't miss my gig.

51:08.960 --> 51:12.140

Do you think I can make
that dumpster, guys?

51:18.440 --> 51:19.820
- No.
- No.

51:19.920 --> 51:22.900
- Yeah, I think I can probably make it.
- Yes, yes, yes, yes! Come on!

51:23.000 --> 51:24.220

(SOFTLY) Hey, honey,
guess where I am. Just guess.

52:28.680 --> 52:30.700
Okay, shut up. I'm at Choozy Doozy.

52:30.800 --> 52:32.100
Where have you been?

52:32.200 --> 52:33.980
I tried to call you, like,
a hundred times.

52:34.080 --> 52:36.620
What was with that crazy phone call
last night?

52:36.720 --> 52:38.540
Crazy call? What do you mean?

52:38.640 --> 52:42.087
You don't remember calling me
and telling me that you were a god?

52:42.560 --> 52:44.688
No. Does that sound like me?

52:45.080 --> 52:47.740
Listen, I had the most amazing night.

52:47.840 --> 52:49.620
I did everything.

52:49.720 --> 52:52.405
(STUTTERS) I punched a man in the face.

52:52.520 --> 52:54.020
Just walked up to him.
(CLICKS TONGUE)

52:54.120 --> 52:56.180
Just punched him with my fist.

52:56.280 --> 52:59.682
I felt like an ape. Like an ape.

53:00.080 --> 53:03.180
I did Eskimo kisses
with this beautiful woman.

53:03.280 --> 53:04.660
What are you talking about?

53:04.760 --> 53:06.046
Honey, have you ever felt

53:06.160 --> 53:11.220
that everything that you've experienced
and said up to this point is just a fraud?

53:11.320 --> 53:12.660
Excuse me?

53:12.760 --> 53:14.580
No. Okay, "fraud" is too strong a word.

53:14.680 --> 53:17.968
It's more like a lie.

53:19.240 --> 53:21.820
"Lie" is actually...
It's not right, either.

53:21.920 --> 53:23.729
It's kind of a hard concept to...

53:24.600 --> 53:26.125
Okay, bye, honey.

53:27.520 --> 53:29.807
All right, that went well.
That went really well.

53:33.160 --> 53:36.420

my friend, because you were almost

54:42.920 --> 54:45.100
about to have to eat
a whole bunch of waffles!

54:45.200 --> 54:47.340
I'm willing to do that. I'm willing...
I'll eat the waffles.

54:47.440 --> 54:48.521
Okay, now...

54:49.160 --> 54:53.180

Just like Lawnmower Man,

55:52.320 --> 55:53.580
except, you know,
we're supposed to fuck.

- This is getting a little dark.
- Dark? What do you mean?

56:19.880 --> 56:22.700
Okay, if this is the most popular show,
give me some of the other shows?

56:22.800 --> 56:24.580
Yeah, of course.
There's Toddler In The Wild,

56:24.680 --> 56:27.251
there's Mommy, I'm Drowning,
there's Daddy. Where Are You Going?

56:27.360 --> 56:29.840
There's, um... Building Explosion.

56:30.440 --> 56:31.940
- Building Explosion?
- Yeah, Building Explosion.

56:32.040 --> 56:34.220
It just shows big buildings
falling down, and...

56:34.320 --> 56:36.780
Kids, like, trapped in the basement,
and the building falls,

56:36.880 --> 56:38.460
and they're like,
"Ma, get me out of here."

56:38.560 --> 56:40.820
And it shows them how
to get out in an emergency,

56:40.920 --> 56:43.161
but also tells them when to give up.

56:43.640 --> 56:44.641
Ah!

56:44.760 --> 56:46.649
Bing bong! What's the delay?

56:46.960 --> 56:48.644
(GROANS) Hey.

56:48.920 --> 56:52.561
Hey. There's something
trying to kill us here.

in the studio!

56:59.080 --> 57:01.686

it's the same goddamn thing.

57:02.160 --> 57:04.527
It's guy on guy, girl on girl.

You're acting like it's 2010,
for Christ's sakes.

57:15.160 --> 57:18.846
Now, we got a show to do, boys!
So start fucking!

57:19.160 --> 57:20.580
Dude, is there, like,
a stage manager around?

57:20.680 --> 57:21.920
I mean, they're gonna kill these guys.

57:22.040 --> 57:23.460

57:23.560 --> 57:26.100

I need to know right now,

57:26.200 --> 57:28.340
do you have a problem with this show?

Well, yeah, clearly I have
a problem with this show.

57:30.360 --> 57:31.691

57:31.800 --> 57:33.740

57:33.840 --> 57:35.260
This is the number one show
in the nation.

57:35.360 --> 57:37.340
This is a show that families enjoy.

57:37.440 --> 57:39.140
- Okay?
- This is a family show?

57:39.240 --> 57:41.140
- Absolutely.
- Like, it's on at, like, 8:00?

57:41.240 --> 57:44.180
It's on at 7:00 on Sunday nights
against Butthole Nation.

58:08.920 --> 58:11.491
I know you are, buddy! I know!

58:12.000 --> 58:13.260
I know. I love you, man!

58:13.360 --> 58:14.500
Don't say that!

58:14.600 --> 58:16.568
I don't wanna have an emotional
connection to this moment!

58:16.720 --> 58:19.420
What... Oh, God forbid
a couple of friends

58:19.520 --> 58:21.540
can't express
their brotherly love for each other!

58:21.640 --> 58:22.620
I love you.

58:22.720 --> 58:24.100
I told you to stop saying that!

58:24.200 --> 58:26.328
I'm so sorry!

58:26.960 --> 58:28.849
JACOB: So there are no more
sex taboos?

58:29.000 --> 58:30.340
Well, I guess bestiality.

58:30.440 --> 58:33.205
But only from
a community property perspective.

58:33.760 --> 58:35.250
What do you... What do you mean?

58:35.760 --> 58:37.660
Oh, you don't remember
Llama v. Ferguson?

58:37.760 --> 58:38.980
Guy tries to divorce a llama,

58:39.080 --> 58:42.004
and the land is in dispute
because the llama needs to graze?

58:43.320 --> 58:45.420
But people still eat animals, right?

58:45.520 --> 58:48.603
Oh, yeah, absolutely. And animals
eat people, it's all the same.

58:50.440 --> 58:53.500
You got a tuft of hair
coming out your crack.

58:53.600 --> 58:55.180
Don't fuckin' worry about it, okay?

58:55.280 --> 58:57.300
I'll get your grooming tips later.

58:57.400 --> 58:58.460
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

58:58.560 --> 58:59.766
Okay. I love you.

59:00.800 --> 59:04.180
All right! Put it in slow!

59:09.640 --> 59:11.244
- Take that dick.
- What the fuck?

59:11.360 --> 59:12.620
Come on! It's just something I say.

59:12.720 --> 59:13.926
"Take that dick"?

59:14.960 --> 59:16.962
Wait, hold on! Stop, stop, stop!

59:20.960 --> 59:22.220
Oh!

59:22.320 --> 59:24.607
Looks like somebody chose a lifeline!

59:24.800 --> 59:26.340
Me! Me! I did it! I chose it!

59:26.440 --> 59:28.442
Who will the lucky winner be?

59:28.640 --> 59:29.846
What happens? Do we get waffles?

59:30.000 --> 59:31.286
- What happened?
- It's a lifeline,

59:31.400 --> 59:33.020
so the chooser picks a new doozer.

59:33.120 --> 59:34.860
You gotta choose someone, Lou.

59:34.960 --> 59:36.500
NICK: Choose waffles.

59:36.600 --> 59:37.567
(GASPS) Oh.

59:37.840 --> 59:38.900
Okay, I get it. I get it.

59:39.000 --> 59:40.570
All right. All right. Uh... (CHUCKLES)

59:40.680 --> 59:44.162
Yeah, I know just the guy.
He loves this show.

59:46.880 --> 59:47.881
Oh!

59:48.160 --> 59:49.540
Oh, no, no, no. I'm...

59:49.640 --> 59:52.291
I'm actually getting married tonight,
so I can't.

59:53.520 --> 59:55.090
It's actually an issue of fidelity.

59:55.320 --> 59:56.540
I cannot do this.

59:56.640 --> 59:58.005
You're a monster, Lou.

01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:05.321
What's up?

01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:07.140
NICK: Get ready, 'cause here it comes.

01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:08.260
Here what comes?

01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:10.044
(ADAM SCREAMING)

01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:13.361
That's my butt!

01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:15.380
(LAUGHING)

01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:18.484
Wow! That was good TV.

01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:22.380
You know what, Adam, I thought about it.

01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:24.740
You can call me Uncle Lou now.

01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:27.161
Holy shit! Did you see that?

01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:29.140
You're a fucking lunatic!

01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:31.220
- Was that the same car?
- Couldn't be.

01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:32.820
That car tried to
run me down on purpose.

01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:34.126
Did you see that?

01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:35.481
(GASPS)

01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:37.370
What if that car's my murderer?

01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:39.260
You were shot in the dick in the past,
remember?

01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:41.300
Oh, like that would be
the craziest fucking thing

01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:43.300
that's ever happened to us.
That car's an asshole.

01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:46.006
The car's not an asshole.
You're an asshole.

01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:48.620
Whoa. Where'd that come from?

01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:52.100
Everything is all about Lou.
No regard for anybody else.

01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:54.500
I'm pretty sure that's never
been the case at all, ever.

01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:56.841
Because of you, Adam just got raped.

01:00:57.160 --> 01:00:58.460
Are we calling it a rape?

01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:00.050
Whoa! Nobody got raped.

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:01.611
It felt like kind of a gray area.

01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:03.330
You're a fucking virus, Lou.

01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:05.010
You find a vulnerable host,

01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:08.140
and you attach yourself
and you just fuck 'em all up.

01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:09.366
LOU: (SCOFFS) Okay.

01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:13.201
Okay. Someone needs
to find a chill-out tent.

01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:15.500
Let's get you a comfy couch and
a video game. What do you say?

01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:18.860
Where does it say in the Shitty Parent's
Handbook to treat your son like shit?

01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:20.540
Well, if it's a Shitty Parent's
Handbook,

01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:23.086
wouldn't it be, like,
the theme of the whole book?

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:25.043
- No, he's right. Wait.
- NICK: No, no, no.

01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:27.766
It's a step-by-step guide
for how to be a shitty parent.

01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:30.380
- Exactly.
- Shitty Parenting for Dummies.

01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:32.420
Okay. You're right. I apologize.

01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:34.260
I apologize. You were totally wrong.

01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:37.060
No, why would someone write that book?
Why would that book exist?

01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:38.660
Actually, Nick's idea about retitling it

01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:40.860
Shitty Parenting for Dummies
is a solid idea.

01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:43.060
- If you want to use the metaphor again.
- LOU: It's an impulse buy.

01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:45.060
All right, you know what?
Forget it. You're right, that's fair.

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:47.020
It was a misleading title.
But the point is...

01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:48.380
Fuck you!

01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:50.700
If they're not gonna say it, I will.

01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:54.140
I am so tired of solving your problems.

01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:56.460
You wanna stop your murder,
figure it out yourself.

01:01:56.560 --> 01:01:57.540
I'm going to Winkle's.

01:01:57.640 --> 01:01:59.540
- Jacob, what the fuck?
- Youngblood!

01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:02.020
No. You know why?
'Cause as long as we're here,

01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:05.660
I'm Jacob fucking Dorchen!
And that means something.

01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:07.860
Jacob, come on!

01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:09.485
Youngblood, we got to figure this out.

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:12.285
LOU: You're the only one
keeping track of important stuff!

01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:14.121
I mean...

01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:15.487
You know what? Fuck it. Fuck it.

01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:17.443
Who cares? Who needs him?
I don't need him.

01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:19.340
Hey, I'm getting married today, guys.

01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:21.220
What do you say we kick this day
in the pants

01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:24.260
and get over there early
for some Bloody Mary-tinis?

01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:25.940
I'm sorry.
Can I just get rid of this thing?

01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:28.520
No! She said not to
take it off for 24 hours.

01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:29.900
- Or what?
- I don't know.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.140
Yeah, exactly.
If I had a dime for every time

01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:34.940
I did something a cocktail waitress
told me not to do,

01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:36.530
I'd be rich. Look.

01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:41.005
Oh! (CHUCKLES)

01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:43.322
Oh, my God,
the cocktail waitress was wrong.

01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:44.460
Sorry, my mistake.

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:45.925
I should listen to you more often, Lou.

01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:47.260
- All right.
- (SIGHS)

01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:48.500
You just learned a valuable life lesson.

01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:49.761
I did.

01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:53.567
Guys?

01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:55.481
Come on.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.047
Mmm...

01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:03.925
Ew, God. So...

01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:06.166
(GASPING)

01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:08.729
- 911, right?
- Yeah.

01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:17.526
(RETCHES)

01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:19.361
LOU: Ugh.

01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:21.522
Fucking disgusting, dude!

01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:24.081
Okay, you're sick. You made your point.

01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:26.521
Come on, Lou,
you know he can't help it.

01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:27.681
You okay, buddy?

01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:28.820
(GURGLES)

01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:31.207
Okay, this is becoming
a bit of a hygiene issue.

01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:33.522
KELLY: All right, let's see
what we have here.

01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:35.483
Okay, yeah.

01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:38.121
Kel.

01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:39.580
Come on, really?

01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:42.809
Divorced? What the fuck
are you talking about?

01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:44.285
Kelly, we're soul mates.

01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:46.805
Not anymore.

01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:50.327
- Mommy?
- No, I'm not your mommy.

01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:53.202
- Homie?
- Yeah, I'm your homie.

01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:55.441
Was it... Was it something you did?

01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:57.780
If so, I don't care.
I don't care. I forgive you.

01:03:57.880 --> 01:03:59.370
- Put this in his mouth.
- (ADAM GROANS)

01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:01.700
If you don't communicate with me,
I can't fix this!

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:02.961
You can't fix anything.

01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:06.140
Hey, bite down on this. Good. Okay.

01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:07.321
What's going on?

01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:08.561
Here we go.

01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:11.407
Okay.

01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:13.700
Oh, that's actually not bad.

01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:15.290
You know, it's, like, kind of sweet.

01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:17.131
What's happening to him?

01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:18.446
Oh, this is totally normal.

01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:20.164
The nanobots are attacking
the narcotics.

01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:22.085
How long has he been on heroin?

01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:23.401
It was a Ladybug.

01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:25.563
- Wait, the sticker?
- Yeah, on the neck.

01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:28.481
Yeah. We normally give Tylenol for that.

01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:29.980
I just pumped him full of...

01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:31.500
Narcotic-seeking nanobots?

01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:32.965
- Yeah.
- Whoops.

01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:34.844
You're a great listener.
I should have married you.

01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:36.684
LOU: Look, Kel, I'm sorry, okay?

01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:39.446
I'm sorry.

01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:40.580
(ADAM GROANS)

01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:42.091
Can we just move on?

01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:44.521
I did move on, Lou. I got clean.

01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:46.762
You're the one who doesn't
have a rock bottom.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.082
I just pray that
there's still hope for Jacob.

01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:52.180
GARY: This ain't a circus!

01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:54.601
Quick juggling
and make some fucking drinks!

01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:56.205
Hey! Jake the Snake!

01:04:56.920 --> 01:04:59.931
Hey, is it still day out there?
Who gives a shit? What can I get you?

01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:01.531
I'll take everything!

01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:03.260
(CHUCKLES)

01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:04.340
You sure about that?

01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:05.965
'Cause, remember what
happened last time?

01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:07.531
Everything.

01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:09.281
Okay.

01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:12.420
All right!
Set Mr. Dorchen up with the usual...

01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:14.807
And, you know, call security.

01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:17.020
KELLY:
The nanobots can't find any drugs,

01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:18.780
so they're traveling to
the lowest part of his body,

01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:20.340
where they'll harden and expand.

01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:22.700
- His feet?
- In his testicles.

01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:24.802
Well, that hardly seems like
the lowest part of his body.

01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:28.042
- Shit!
- What's happening?

01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:29.620
Okay. It's now or never.

01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:30.801
ADAM: (STAMMERING)
What are you doing?

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:32.700
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- (LAUGHS)

01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:33.780
What is that?

01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:34.940
What you gonna do with that?

01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:36.041
Stick him! Stick him!

01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:37.491
(SCREAMING)

01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:40.411
(SCREAMING)

01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:43.166
(EXCLAIMS) Oh, shit!

01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:45.090
(CONTINUES SCREAMING)

01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:48.580
That's a lot of juice!

01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:50.011
Okay! Enough!

01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:52.300
Now what's gonna happen,
I'm going to pull this out,

01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:53.740
and there might be some leakage, okay?

01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:55.460
(STAMMERS)
Don't pull it out. Don't pull it out.

01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:57.688
- I like it where it is.
- KELLY: One, two, three...

01:05:57.920 --> 01:05:59.160
(ADAM SCREAMING)

01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:01.050
Ha! Ah!

01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:05.090
- LOU: Oh, wow! Okay.
- Fuck your ball juice!

01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:06.201
(SPITS)

01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:08.891
Oh, I walked right into that one.
Literally.

01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:11.642
Oh, I don't know about you guys,
but I feel way better.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.684
There's definitely semen in that.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.082
There's definitely fucking
semen in that.

01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:19.364
Did you taste the robots?
They're gritty.

01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:25.521
Oh, fucking bottle service.

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:27.444
- (GRUNTS)
- WOMAN: Hey!

01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:34.530
Every fucking weekend.

01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:36.131
Hey, baby. (SNIFFS)

01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:38.807
You're a fuck-up, Jacob.

01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:40.980
Just like your loser dad.

01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:43.401
I'm not anything like my fucking dad!

01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:51.140
No... Oh, no, wait, wait, wait.

01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:52.241
(GROANS)

I've seen our future together

The drugs, the constant partying.

"When is enough enough?"

Yes, of course it does.

Yeah. A lot of highs and lows here.

- Yeah.
- You know, when you think about it,

01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:44.571
Lou had to fuck your wife in the future,
so you could meet her in the past.

01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:47.122
- Well...
- Yeah. But, hey...

01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:48.920

JACOB: Hey, just think of it this way.

01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:57.084
Since it happened in the future,
it technically hasn't happened at all.

It's cyclical.

I didn't meet my dad,

but did you ejaculate in her?

Hey. That doesn't matter.

01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:17.122
I ejaculated inside of you.

both just hypothetical future scenarios.

I think it was when my nephew
from the future

01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:36.281
had a shotgun pointed at my dick
that I'd helped him place there.

That was me.

everything became clear to me.
