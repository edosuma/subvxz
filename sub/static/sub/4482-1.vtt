01:11.260 --> 01:15.280
[It is 1795, the nineteenth year
of King Jeonjo's reign]

01:15.281 --> 01:22.756
[At this time, Joseon relies entirely
on imports from Japan for silver.]

01:22.757 --> 01:30.757
[At one point, a large amount of
counterfeit silver enters circulation]

01:31.334 --> 01:38.575
[creating a substantial threat
to the economy in Joseon.]

01:40.121 --> 01:45.101
[King Jeonjo secretly commands
his closest ally to investigate.]

01:45.102 --> 01:50.978
[That man is Joseon's first detective
who will search for the truth and justice.]

02:31.745 --> 02:33.768
You filthy rat!

02:34.324 --> 02:40.424
How dare you steal from the master
who has been taking care of you, huh?

02:41.969 --> 02:43.419
- My lord...
- If you stole from me...

02:43.420 --> 02:45.180
Did you think I wouldn't
be able to find you?

02:47.121 --> 02:48.869
My... my lord...

02:48.870 --> 02:51.376
What are you doing?
Hurry up and kill him.

02:54.864 --> 02:59.427
If I pay you good money,
then I want my money's worth.

03:06.393 --> 03:08.579
S-spare me.

03:08.580 --> 03:13.421
If you spare me, I'll double whatever
the lord has promised you.

03:19.842 --> 03:21.132
What are you doing?

03:21.133 --> 03:23.202
Cut his throat, you barbarians!

03:23.203 --> 03:25.367
This barbarians, you'll regret...

03:31.960 --> 03:33.323
I told you.

03:33.324 --> 03:37.974
Life or death depends on
the order payment is received.

03:50.985 --> 03:52.945
Is this the formula
for making counterfeit silver?

03:53.534 --> 03:56.169
So in your attempt
to steal this from your master...

03:57.437 --> 03:58.957
you'll ultimately die in the end, too.

04:11.995 --> 04:14.108
Have you seen the boss?

04:15.420 --> 04:17.702
I heard he's asked for me.

04:18.043 --> 04:21.466
The boss. He's... over there.

04:22.767 --> 04:25.049
I didn't find him there.

04:25.050 --> 04:28.389
If not there... then perhaps
somewhere over here?

04:32.367 --> 04:34.254
He's not here, is he?

04:34.255 --> 04:35.972
No, he isn't.

04:35.973 --> 04:38.096
If you've come to infiltrate
the enemy's camp

04:39.247 --> 04:42.745
then shouldn't you at least know
what the boss looks like, huh?

04:51.543 --> 04:53.761
Someone has surely put him up to this.

04:53.762 --> 04:56.257
I'll beat a confession out of him.

05:00.055 --> 05:01.547
That's enough, kid.

05:01.548 --> 05:05.857
We'll know when we hang him
whether someone comes for him or not.

05:09.418 --> 05:12.104
You all right, Seo Pil?

05:12.105 --> 05:14.450
I know you're hurt,
but at least you're still alive.

05:14.451 --> 05:16.137
Know that I just saved your life.

05:17.855 --> 05:19.400
And who got me here
in the first place?

05:19.401 --> 05:22.385
You told me to come for you
if you didn't return in a month's time.

05:22.386 --> 05:23.397
That's right.

05:23.398 --> 05:26.352
I underestimated my own sociability.

05:26.353 --> 05:30.095
I never imagined that I'd pull off
my undercover assignment so perfectly.

05:30.096 --> 05:31.758
You bastard!

05:31.759 --> 05:34.169
Tell me! Why have you come?

05:34.170 --> 05:36.474
I've come to contact
an undercover detect...

05:36.475 --> 05:37.763
Goodness!

05:37.764 --> 05:39.789
How could you tell the truth!

05:39.790 --> 05:41.550
The words are just flowing
out of my mouth...

05:43.822 --> 05:47.095
The boss has a secret vault
to store his important items.

05:47.096 --> 05:49.825
It takes him roughly eight minutes
to walk there.

05:49.826 --> 05:51.436
Four minutes each way.

05:51.437 --> 05:55.638
His average stride length is two feet.
Multiply that by 300 strides...

05:55.639 --> 05:57.174
and that's 600 feet.

05:57.175 --> 05:59.255
That's where the clue
to the counterfeit silver lies.

06:00.908 --> 06:03.767
A 20 feet high tree located
600 feet away is roughly one inch.

06:06.827 --> 06:08.203
So, this is it.

06:08.204 --> 06:10.293
The vault must be
around here somewhere...

06:12.834 --> 06:14.599
Nothing here!

06:14.600 --> 06:16.958
How pathetic.
No wonder why you got dumped.

06:31.410 --> 06:33.126
Did you see?

06:33.127 --> 06:36.603
If it weren't for me, it would've
remained a riddle forever.

06:38.086 --> 06:40.923
You're still a pompous trout
even in a dung tub.

06:43.642 --> 06:45.642
Can't see a thing because
it's pitch black in here.

07:03.779 --> 07:05.111
My lord.

07:05.112 --> 07:08.141
These are from Ming Dynasty.
I've never seen anything like them.

07:08.620 --> 07:10.038
How can we take all these with us?

07:14.410 --> 07:17.534
As I had expected, a formula for
manufacturing counterfeit silver

07:17.535 --> 07:19.443
along with our silver
smelting secrets.

07:19.444 --> 07:22.377
If we destroy this, it'll be the end
of the counterfeit silver production.

07:24.083 --> 07:26.116
- What is that?
- It's a 'jipu.'

07:26.117 --> 07:27.266
Jip...

07:27.267 --> 07:29.060
A little invention of mine,
a portable fire.

07:30.519 --> 07:35.253
The spark created by the flints
light the kerosene-soaked straw.

07:35.254 --> 07:37.163
Or 'jip' as they call it.
Hence, 'jipu.'

07:41.120 --> 07:43.229
What are you doing
to these fine paintings?

07:43.230 --> 07:44.936
Better destroy them before
they're used for dishonorable means.

07:44.937 --> 07:46.345
Let's go.

07:54.514 --> 07:56.838
Oh no.

07:56.839 --> 07:58.353
What do we do now?

08:05.524 --> 08:08.070
We'll either burn
or get beaten to death!

08:08.071 --> 08:09.144
Seal the entrance.

08:11.211 --> 08:14.098
How are we going to escape
if we seal the entrance?

08:20.978 --> 08:22.641
You jerks!

08:30.331 --> 08:34.154
Backdraft. When a compartment fire
is suddenly exposed to air

08:34.155 --> 08:35.874
a backdraft explosion occurs.

08:38.047 --> 08:39.080
Get out of the way.

08:39.081 --> 08:41.433
Get under the covers
and hold your breath.

09:21.572 --> 09:22.624
Let's jump.

09:22.625 --> 09:24.702
Are you insane to jump off of here?

09:24.703 --> 09:25.940
We'll face certain death if we don't.

09:25.941 --> 09:28.319
You go ahead, my lord.
I can't jump.

09:28.320 --> 09:31.156
How can I hope to live
knowing that I had left you to die?

09:31.157 --> 09:33.951
If you die here, then I shall make
this place my grave, too.

09:38.610 --> 09:40.392
Let's jump together then, my lord.

09:40.796 --> 09:42.298
Good thinking.

09:42.299 --> 09:43.484
We jump on three.

09:45.062 --> 09:47.504
- One, two, three!
- One, two, three!

09:50.586 --> 09:55.258
I would happily give my life
to my lord...

09:56.926 --> 10:01.018
That son of a bitch!

10:27.003 --> 10:28.748
What a relief that you're not dead.

10:28.749 --> 10:30.378
Whatever happened to dying together?

10:30.379 --> 10:31.957
Why didn't you jump?

10:31.958 --> 10:34.229
People like me can
calculate 18,000 things

10:34.230 --> 10:35.764
in a blink of an eye.

10:35.765 --> 10:38.441
It occurred to me just as
I was about to jump.

10:38.442 --> 10:40.553
That it could kill me
if things went horribly wrong.

10:40.554 --> 10:43.156
You couldn't tell from a glance?
You had to calculate that?

10:43.157 --> 10:46.153
Seeing as you didn't die,
I guess I was wrong.

10:46.154 --> 10:47.273
Seriously.

10:47.274 --> 10:49.279
I almost became a water ghost.

10:50.462 --> 10:54.109
Right, what happened to the bandits?

10:54.110 --> 10:58.249
You think His Majesty would leave
a treasured asset like me to die?

11:00.307 --> 11:02.749
Don't let anyone get away.

11:03.517 --> 11:07.186
You are free to kill them
if they resist.

11:20.649 --> 11:23.613
In any case, since you solved a big case

11:23.614 --> 11:25.404
the king will reward you
with a high position...

11:25.405 --> 11:28.393
Hold it, when have I ever been
interested in those kinds of things?

11:34.971 --> 11:37.798
[Detective K: Secret of the Lost Island]

11:42.938 --> 11:47.450
[Six months later]

12:14.169 --> 12:15.980
Your Majesty!

12:15.981 --> 12:20.568
What Your Majesty's ministers call
a time of peace is only for the rich.

12:21.158 --> 12:23.353
If there is even one hungry subject

12:23.354 --> 12:25.423
how can one call that
a time of peace?

12:26.833 --> 12:28.162
Your Majesty!

12:28.163 --> 12:32.067
Please be a wise king who
opens his ears to the hungry.

12:36.067 --> 12:37.730
That's Japan in that direction.

12:42.725 --> 12:44.308
And that's the direction of Qing.

12:44.309 --> 12:46.591
How many kings do you serve?

12:46.592 --> 12:48.364
Such a poor sense of direction.

12:50.145 --> 12:51.680
Your Majesty.

12:51.681 --> 12:54.665
This servant will depart this world
before you. Please...

12:54.666 --> 12:57.248
Stay healthy and strong for
your nation and its subjects.

12:58.037 --> 13:00.234
What are you doing?
Trying to poison yourself?

13:01.054 --> 13:04.360
I brought that back
from my trip to Qing.

13:04.361 --> 13:06.812
It's restorative herbal medicine
that I got for you.

13:06.813 --> 13:08.722
Drink it all in one gulp.

13:10.044 --> 13:12.880
How can I take herbal medicine
as a sinner in exile?

13:12.881 --> 13:15.121
I hear it's really good for men.

13:19.772 --> 13:21.298
It's bitter.

13:26.993 --> 13:29.051
All right... dinner is served.

13:29.977 --> 13:33.401
Now that I got to see you,
and made you dinner

13:33.402 --> 13:34.595
it's time for me to get going.

13:34.596 --> 13:37.732
- Why have you come?
- Since you're asking...

13:38.778 --> 13:40.687
Counterfeit silver
is back in circulation.

13:44.793 --> 13:46.220
The real problem here is that

13:46.221 --> 13:51.159
it's virtually impossible to tell
the fakes apart from the authentic ones.

13:51.160 --> 13:54.466
Probably not if scrutinized
under an ordinary eye like yours.

13:56.385 --> 13:58.615
The answer is often closer
than one believes.

14:00.833 --> 14:04.085
Counterfeit silver is usually
mixed with iron or copper

14:04.086 --> 14:07.936
which is almost one-fifths
lighter in its mass.

14:08.682 --> 14:12.074
If you place a real silver bullion
in place of the counterfeit silver

14:12.075 --> 14:13.814
then the water will
naturally spill over...

14:13.815 --> 14:15.537
But it doesn't, does it?

14:15.538 --> 14:16.956
You think I wouldn't have
tested that already?

14:16.957 --> 14:18.889
What's happened to you in your exile?

14:19.753 --> 14:21.266
This fake is well-made, indeed.

14:21.267 --> 14:23.335
You haven't grasped
the gravity of the situation.

14:23.336 --> 14:25.551
If counterfeit silver leads to
a currency crisis

14:25.552 --> 14:28.613
then it'll affect international trade and
the price of necessities will skyrocket.

14:28.614 --> 14:31.033
What normally costs one nyang
will cost ten nyangs.

14:31.034 --> 14:33.955
The suffering of the poor
will increase by two, no tenfold.

14:33.956 --> 14:37.495
It's ridiculous that someone as smart as
you are sitting around, just wasting away!

14:38.605 --> 14:40.376
Are you suggesting that I break the law?

14:41.561 --> 14:44.961
This islet is inhabited by Kim Min,
who is six months into his exile.

14:44.962 --> 14:47.009
I got it, so let's just get going.

14:47.010 --> 14:50.658
But we're supposed to keep a close eye
to prevent them from running away.

14:52.302 --> 14:53.697
He's right there. Over there.

14:54.583 --> 14:56.054
So let's go.

14:57.600 --> 14:59.210
But we should go and check anyway.

14:59.211 --> 15:00.533
What the...

15:01.152 --> 15:03.125
All right. We'll check then.

15:04.471 --> 15:06.548
You're Lord Kim, aren't you?

15:06.549 --> 15:08.693
Yes, I am!

15:11.985 --> 15:14.200
He says it's him.

15:28.011 --> 15:29.644
My lord?

15:32.908 --> 15:34.658
My lord?

15:35.553 --> 15:37.346
My lord!

15:41.366 --> 15:42.475
My lord!

15:43.288 --> 15:45.109
Who's there?

15:51.801 --> 15:52.973
Glow in the dark?

15:52.974 --> 15:56.173
In any case, you're insane enough
doing all these strange things yourself.

15:57.029 --> 15:58.393
Human bones?

15:58.394 --> 16:00.814
Luminous pigments can be obtained
from animal bones.

16:00.815 --> 16:05.006
You shouldn't disturb the graves
lest you want do deal with ghosts.

16:09.816 --> 16:11.533
What are you doing?

16:13.111 --> 16:14.721
You have to do this in order to
prevent getting possessed by a spirit.

16:14.722 --> 16:17.163
Sea water is the same thing as salt.

16:17.164 --> 16:19.937
There's no such thing as ghosts...

16:31.683 --> 16:36.682
How can a man believe
in something like that?

17:00.490 --> 17:02.517
I just had the strangest dream.

17:02.518 --> 17:04.309
Still dreaming, I see.

17:08.425 --> 17:10.815
I had a very restful sleep...

17:11.412 --> 17:12.969
She's not a ghost. She's human.

17:12.970 --> 17:15.257
She swam across the ocean
in order to meet you.

17:15.258 --> 17:16.566
Such a scaredy-cat.

17:18.614 --> 17:20.853
You crossed the ocean to meet me?

17:20.854 --> 17:25.961
The tide is low at this time,
so it isn't difficult to walk over.

17:25.962 --> 17:28.726
Why did you want to see me?

17:29.759 --> 17:31.625
It's all right, you can tell him.

17:31.626 --> 17:34.229
He's only banished and in exile.

17:38.699 --> 17:41.353
I heard that you were
a famous detective in Hanyang.

17:41.354 --> 17:43.796
Please help me find my little sister.

17:43.797 --> 17:45.406
Your sister?

17:45.407 --> 17:49.608
It's been a fortnight since
she vanished out of the blue.

17:49.609 --> 17:51.294
She's easy to recognize.

17:51.295 --> 17:54.014
She has a big mole here.

17:54.015 --> 17:57.951
Please find her, my lord.
If you'll find her for me...

17:59.102 --> 18:02.001
I have nothing to offer you,
but I'll be your slave...

18:02.002 --> 18:03.357
Go home at once.

18:03.997 --> 18:05.297
But, my lord...

18:05.298 --> 18:07.973
As you can see, I'm a prisoner in exile.

18:07.974 --> 18:11.025
I cannot leave this place
nor can I help you.

18:11.026 --> 18:12.306
You must go back.

18:15.018 --> 18:18.596
That's right.
He's in a bind, after all...

18:18.597 --> 18:20.377
You should report it
to the Magistrate instead.

18:20.378 --> 18:22.842
They won't even listen to
a lowly girl like myself.

18:22.843 --> 18:27.140
My friend's father was flogged
for simply asking for their help.

18:27.141 --> 18:28.507
Send her back.

18:30.471 --> 18:33.176
Come on, little one. Let's go.

18:38.372 --> 18:41.848
She's like a seal,
such an amazing swimmer.

18:42.950 --> 18:44.687
Couldn't you grant her request?

18:44.688 --> 18:47.000
Do you know what's even more
frightening than filial piety?

18:47.001 --> 18:48.493
It's poverty.

18:48.494 --> 18:53.165
So many children become slaves
or prostitutes by their parents' wishes.

18:53.166 --> 18:56.397
There are citizens who
burn down their own homes

18:56.398 --> 18:58.541
or run away into the mountains
to avoid paying hefty taxes.

18:58.542 --> 19:02.626
If you can save three family members
by sacrificing one

19:02.627 --> 19:04.548
what would you do in that situation?

19:06.369 --> 19:09.280
We cannot even blame the parents.

19:09.281 --> 19:11.949
If there's someone to blame,
then it would be the world.

19:14.326 --> 19:15.893
What are you doing?

19:15.894 --> 19:17.546
I understand how you feel.

19:17.547 --> 19:19.967
Which is why we must go to the mainland
and do something about it.

19:19.968 --> 19:24.009
The more fake silver goes into circulation,
the greater the poorer's sufferings become.

19:24.010 --> 19:26.153
Why did you blow out the light?

19:26.154 --> 19:28.691
I have many more
important things left to say!

19:28.692 --> 19:31.454
- Huh?
- Maybe I need more powder.

19:31.455 --> 19:33.672
Just a little more
and it will be useful.

19:33.673 --> 19:36.191
What? You've done something
to my lips, haven't you?

19:43.679 --> 19:46.888
Have you awoken?
Your breakfast will be served shortly.

19:49.864 --> 19:51.890
Why are you here doing this?

19:51.891 --> 19:54.172
Please go on inside.
It's almost ready.

19:54.173 --> 19:56.594
Why is this child doing this here?

19:56.595 --> 19:59.132
She was so persistent.

19:59.133 --> 20:01.436
And she's a great little cook.

20:03.068 --> 20:04.486
Stop this instant
and leave at once!

20:04.487 --> 20:06.204
Go on!

20:15.644 --> 20:17.540
What's this?

20:17.541 --> 20:20.441
Looks like a fun toy.

20:20.442 --> 20:23.034
Is it for exercise?

20:23.035 --> 20:24.985
Put it down if you want to
keep your hand.

20:24.986 --> 20:26.383
What about my hand?

20:26.384 --> 20:29.081
Have you ever heard of a ghost bomb?

20:29.082 --> 20:32.455
A bomb? It doesn't even go off.
You think I'd be fooled?

20:39.772 --> 20:41.136
A bombshell?

20:51.142 --> 20:53.029
Do you find noblemen laughable?

20:54.093 --> 20:56.733
Don't you know the punishment for acting
in contempt of a nobleman?

20:57.960 --> 20:59.835
You'll be flogged until
your skin is disfigured

20:59.836 --> 21:03.088
or skewered through your fingers
until your hand is crushed.

21:04.250 --> 21:06.009
That's all okay.

21:07.192 --> 21:11.247
If you... If you only find my sister.

21:16.750 --> 21:18.584
You made a girl cry,
you shameless man.

21:18.585 --> 21:20.526
Go fetch some water.

21:23.490 --> 21:26.785
What a lazy bum.

21:26.786 --> 21:28.960
There's a well
right in front of the house.

21:28.961 --> 21:32.287
He couldn't bother
to make a rope for the well?

21:32.288 --> 21:34.248
You need to knot together
at least five feet more.

21:34.784 --> 21:35.957
Is that right?

21:36.808 --> 21:38.578
Don't you think this will be enough?

21:38.579 --> 21:42.825
The well's width is 3.5 feet
and I'm 4.5 feet tall.

21:43.614 --> 21:46.504
I stepped back to here
and looked at the water in the well

21:46.505 --> 21:49.596
and I couldn't see it
after moving back 1.5 feet.

21:49.597 --> 21:51.858
Then that means
the distance to the water...

21:53.138 --> 21:56.614
The well's depth to my height is

21:56.615 --> 22:00.730
the width of the well
and 1.5 feet.

22:00.731 --> 22:05.467
Four-five and three-five is 1715.

22:05.468 --> 22:09.894
Divided by 15 is 10.5 feet.

22:10.932 --> 22:12.954
You'll need 11 feet of rope.

22:16.196 --> 22:18.080
She's right.

22:19.009 --> 22:22.826
You seem to know the multiplication table.
Have you learned arithmetic?

22:22.827 --> 22:24.555
No, sir.

22:24.556 --> 22:29.120
Whenever the villagers have trouble
with making rope for a well...

22:29.121 --> 22:31.094
It's just something that I came up with.

22:32.724 --> 22:34.867
What is your name?

22:34.868 --> 22:36.585
Da Hae, sir.

22:36.586 --> 22:41.438
Da Hae?
As in 'abundant' and 'ocean'?

22:41.439 --> 22:43.048
No, sir.

22:43.049 --> 22:46.740
It means 'the one who does
everything and anything.'

22:47.731 --> 22:50.612
I must do everything
so that I won't starve.

22:51.414 --> 22:53.437
My sister's name is Do Hae.

22:53.438 --> 22:56.093
Does that stand for
'one who does everything too'?

22:56.094 --> 22:58.588
- Yes, sir.
- I see.

22:58.589 --> 23:01.565
They give children
such funny names these days.

23:11.613 --> 23:14.428
I don't know what to do.

23:14.429 --> 23:17.200
One needs to buy something

23:17.201 --> 23:21.499
but when each person chips in
five nyang, we have six nyang left over

23:21.500 --> 23:25.467
but when each pay three nyang,
the group is four nyang short.

23:26.407 --> 23:29.594
How many people are there
and what is the price of the item?

23:30.948 --> 23:33.143
Make one's stand.

23:33.144 --> 23:36.162
Make ten's lie down.

23:36.163 --> 23:38.765
Five times four...

24:03.096 --> 24:08.276
So, that's five people
and the item costs 19 nyang.

24:39.462 --> 24:42.021
Is there something you want to be
when you grow up?

24:42.644 --> 24:45.470
Could I... grow up to become something?

24:46.451 --> 24:49.916
If you could, then what would you
want to become?

24:51.644 --> 24:53.606
Don't be shy and tell me.

24:53.607 --> 24:56.518
Oh... it's not that I'm shy.

24:56.519 --> 25:00.082
Just that I've never
thought about it before.

25:02.068 --> 25:03.718
I see.

25:09.320 --> 25:11.300
This is my little sister.

25:14.818 --> 25:16.450
Haven't I told you already?

25:16.451 --> 25:18.358
I'm a prisoner in exile.

25:18.359 --> 25:23.403
I know.
If you ever return to Hanyang...

25:23.404 --> 25:28.034
I just thought you could help me
search for her if you were to return.

25:28.035 --> 25:30.156
I don't know when that will be.

25:35.275 --> 25:38.152
Whenever that may be, I must find her.

25:38.153 --> 25:39.773
She's my sister.

25:43.506 --> 25:44.861
It was my fault.

25:45.762 --> 25:48.940
I left her alone to go watch an exorcism.

25:54.932 --> 25:56.775
It's not your fault.

25:56.776 --> 25:59.345
No, it's my fault.

25:59.346 --> 26:01.788
I was supposed to look after her.

26:02.855 --> 26:04.701
Go back before it's too late.

26:05.159 --> 26:08.092
- After I prepare your dinner...
- No.

26:09.179 --> 26:12.923
The wind is growing stronger,
so don't think about coming tomorrow.

26:32.483 --> 26:35.555
It looks like there will be a storm.

26:35.556 --> 26:37.720
Perfect weather for an experiment.

26:37.721 --> 26:39.181
An experiment?

26:39.182 --> 26:42.531
- What sort of an experiment?
- For flying.

26:43.313 --> 26:46.178
Flying? Flying... what?

26:46.179 --> 26:47.724
A man.

26:48.268 --> 26:51.058
As of today, human beings
will gain wings to fly.

27:16.232 --> 27:17.978
Almost succeeded.

27:19.523 --> 27:22.594
You call that a success?

27:22.595 --> 27:24.205
Goodness.

27:37.163 --> 27:39.350
It's almost ready, my lord.

27:39.351 --> 27:41.420
You swam through this storm?

27:42.087 --> 27:44.111
Didn't I tell you not to come?

27:44.996 --> 27:46.893
No matter how many times
you come to see me

27:46.894 --> 27:48.524
I cannot find your sister.

27:48.525 --> 27:50.923
Just think of her as being dead,
and go on with your life!

27:50.924 --> 27:53.324
No! I will find her!

27:53.325 --> 27:55.423
What will possibly change
if you found her?

27:55.424 --> 27:59.500
Isn't it better for her if she
doesn't starve wherever she is?

28:00.228 --> 28:02.856
Think carefully about what
will be in her best interest.

28:02.857 --> 28:06.740
My sister... she can't fend
for herself without me.

28:07.199 --> 28:11.847
She's so easily scared that she can't
fall asleep unless I hold her hand.

28:11.848 --> 28:14.088
- I must find her and...
- I won't hear any more of this!

28:15.042 --> 28:17.043
The storm will ride itself out
soon enough.

28:17.044 --> 28:19.347
You are to return home
and never come back!

29:02.284 --> 29:05.568
How many days has it been
since we've seen her...

29:09.588 --> 29:11.177
Wait, wait, wait!

29:11.178 --> 29:13.556
Hold on! Hold on!

29:13.557 --> 29:14.719
Wait there!

29:17.172 --> 29:20.316
- There's a boat.
- I shall go to the mainland.

29:20.317 --> 29:21.554
Pardon?

29:21.555 --> 29:25.469
- I've received word from Taema-do.
- Taema-do?

29:25.470 --> 29:28.081
I sent a man there to investigate
the cross-channel ferry.

29:28.082 --> 29:31.430
If the silver bullion bars aboard
that ship were fakes

29:31.431 --> 29:33.093
then it means the Japanese
are making counterfeit...

29:33.094 --> 29:34.256
They were authentic.

29:34.257 --> 29:35.950
What?

29:35.951 --> 29:38.692
Are you saying that the counterfeits
are being made in Joseon?

29:38.693 --> 29:40.665
I'll need to visit
the Japanese Settlement.

29:40.666 --> 29:42.829
You mean the trading town
in the mainland?

29:42.830 --> 29:45.294
That's also the first stop for
the cross-channel ferry.

29:45.295 --> 29:46.873
We'll start there.

29:46.874 --> 29:48.887
What about the boat?
It's leaving.

29:48.888 --> 29:49.988
Get ready.

30:06.337 --> 30:10.497
What the? A boat I've never
seen before is coming.

30:10.498 --> 30:14.082
It's a call-boat.
It comes when it's called.

30:15.201 --> 30:16.234
A call-boat?

30:16.830 --> 30:19.645
Wow, how convenient.

30:19.646 --> 30:22.760
In exchange, I'll have to pay extra
for calling its services.

30:22.761 --> 30:25.618
- Did you call for me, my lord?
- Who charges calling fees anymore?

30:25.619 --> 30:27.251
Charging for everything nowadays.

30:31.520 --> 30:34.247
Take us to the mainland...

30:34.248 --> 30:36.211
Hey! It-it-it's you!

30:36.615 --> 30:39.324
You're Minister Kim's assassin!

30:43.579 --> 30:44.827
Come here, you!

30:46.942 --> 30:48.846
You're still frivolous as ever.

30:48.847 --> 30:51.022
What is the meaning of this, my lord?

30:51.023 --> 30:53.347
Isn't this the same assassin
that's tried to kill you?

30:53.348 --> 30:54.809
That's all in the past.

30:54.810 --> 30:56.591
I asked him for a favor.

30:56.592 --> 30:58.458
Sit still.

31:00.271 --> 31:02.863
Kim Min inhabits this islet, right?

31:02.864 --> 31:04.281
Yes.

31:05.667 --> 31:08.289
- That must be him, then.
- Of course it must be.

31:08.290 --> 31:09.825
Maybe it isn't him.

31:09.826 --> 31:12.652
Even a quick glance makes it obvious
that it's him.

31:12.653 --> 31:13.879
Don't you think he's gotten smaller?

31:13.880 --> 31:15.969
You think being in exile
is particularly thrilling?

31:15.970 --> 31:18.170
Would he get any taller?
He probably shrunk from defeat.

31:18.724 --> 31:20.608
It's you, Lord Kim, right?

31:20.962 --> 31:22.941
I'm telling you, it's him.

31:22.942 --> 31:24.519
Don't talk to me like a peer.

31:24.520 --> 31:26.738
I'm your supervisor,
and you're all grown up now?

31:26.739 --> 31:28.413
What's wrong?

31:35.770 --> 31:37.729
What happens if you get caught
having left your station of exile?

31:37.730 --> 31:38.796
Death by poison.

31:38.797 --> 31:40.320
Will you be okay?

31:40.321 --> 31:43.019
Counterfeit silver is creating chaos
in this country.

31:43.020 --> 31:45.068
I cannot be afraid for my own safety.

31:51.926 --> 31:54.326
Hey, they're gone.

31:57.996 --> 31:59.969
No harm in being careful.

32:11.872 --> 32:13.801
Is this Da Hae's home?

32:16.991 --> 32:19.604
Da Hae. Da Hae!

32:19.605 --> 32:20.841
Excuse me.

32:20.842 --> 32:22.910
- Da Hae, is that you?
- You poor thing, really.

32:24.990 --> 32:29.509
She's lost her mind after losing her
youngest and her eldest has gone missing...

32:29.510 --> 32:32.284
What do you mean, 'gone missing'?

32:32.285 --> 32:35.386
Da Hae swam across
the ocean every day

32:35.387 --> 32:37.808
to see some detective from Hanyang.

32:38.737 --> 32:43.312
Maybe she's found a clue or something.

32:43.313 --> 32:46.513
She left saying she knows where her sister
may be, and we haven't seen her since.

32:47.769 --> 32:51.545
I don't know if the mother really
lost them or sold them off.

32:52.846 --> 32:57.163
There's not a single family
in this village

32:57.164 --> 32:59.524
who hasn't sold off their children
as slaves or prostitutes.

33:00.460 --> 33:04.672
Don't you worry.
I'll bring her back wherever she may be.

33:04.673 --> 33:06.700
I'm pretty good at this, aren't I?

33:09.461 --> 33:10.772
What are you doing?

33:10.773 --> 33:12.405
Over there.

33:18.153 --> 33:19.390
My lord.

33:19.391 --> 33:21.064
Oh, come on!

33:21.065 --> 33:22.420
Stop!

33:24.520 --> 33:25.800
Stop! Stop right there!

33:29.587 --> 33:33.117
Seriously.
Why didn't you just act naturally?

33:33.961 --> 33:36.169
Even I admit that I was
acting too awkward.

33:41.202 --> 33:43.463
Isn't this you?

33:44.766 --> 33:49.020
This drawing doesn't do justice
to my doe-like eyes.

33:50.087 --> 33:53.949
Looking at the pompous air
in this drawing, it definitely is you.

33:54.523 --> 33:55.825
Why I ought to...

34:09.614 --> 34:13.422
Do you know what must be done in order
not to forget who your sworn enemy is?

34:13.998 --> 34:17.443
You think of that bastard in your head
as you carve a scar on yourself.

34:22.233 --> 34:25.612
That way, you'll never forget your enemy
whenever you look at the scar.

34:25.614 --> 34:27.918
You haven't forgotten
about me either, have you?

34:29.400 --> 34:33.973
I would love to skin you alive.

34:33.974 --> 34:35.949
Is that okay with you, newbie?

35:25.693 --> 35:26.728
[Magistrate's Court]

35:27.896 --> 35:29.930
- Let's go inside.
- Are you insane?

35:29.931 --> 35:31.190
You know what that place is.

35:31.766 --> 35:33.951
We're surely dead if they catch us.

35:33.952 --> 35:35.252
That way is our only chance at survival.

35:35.253 --> 35:36.608
How do we get inside?

35:37.431 --> 35:39.849
Hit me. If a commoner like you
hits a nobleman...

35:42.132 --> 35:43.390
What the?

35:43.391 --> 35:46.068
This scum hit a nobleman.

35:47.148 --> 35:49.917
Okay, but come back tomorrow.

35:49.918 --> 35:51.687
What do you mean,
come back tomorrow?

35:51.688 --> 35:54.417
There's a very important guest
expected at court today

35:54.418 --> 35:57.573
but having petty criminals around would
make the place look bad

35:57.574 --> 35:59.685
so he sent all of them home.

35:59.686 --> 36:02.469
So just go back home for the day,
and come back tomorrow.

36:04.400 --> 36:06.192
Oh boy.

36:07.804 --> 36:09.988
- We'll have to tell them.
- But my lord...

36:09.989 --> 36:12.004
You could really be sentenced to death.

36:12.005 --> 36:13.380
Let's avoid imminent death first.

36:16.146 --> 36:18.617
I... have escaped from exile.

36:19.650 --> 36:22.797
- Are you perhaps Lord Kim?
- It is I.

36:23.318 --> 36:24.468
Come back tomorrow.

36:24.469 --> 36:26.580
I said I escaped from
the islet I was exiled to!

36:26.581 --> 36:28.085
That must have been difficult.

36:35.967 --> 36:37.593
What are you doing?

36:37.594 --> 36:39.034
What do you think you're doing?

36:42.867 --> 36:44.730
You've got so many layers.

36:49.731 --> 36:51.610
What are they doing?

36:52.889 --> 36:54.862
Arrest them immediately,
and bring them inside!

37:01.454 --> 37:03.415
You rascals!

37:03.416 --> 37:07.680
How dare you harm public morals
with an unspeakable act?

37:07.681 --> 37:10.151
The one on the left said the guy
on the right assaulted him.

37:10.152 --> 37:11.462
But you told us to go away.

37:11.463 --> 37:12.613
He also claims to have
escaped from exile.

37:12.614 --> 37:13.658
You bastard...

37:13.659 --> 37:16.058
Do you know how serious
of a crime that is?

37:16.059 --> 37:18.457
You'll be transferred to Hanyang tomorrow.

37:18.458 --> 37:19.897
- Do as I command!
- Yes, sir!

37:19.898 --> 37:23.376
Throw these men into jail immediately.

37:33.594 --> 37:36.312
E...e... excuse me, Your Honor.

37:36.313 --> 37:39.553
- Magistrate!
- What is it?

37:39.554 --> 37:43.256
Rather than letting us
stay comfortably in jail

37:43.257 --> 37:46.102
shouldn't you torture us
for our crimes instead?

37:46.103 --> 37:48.076
Have you lost your mind?

37:48.077 --> 37:51.158
Never mind that, Your Honor!
We'll be fine in jail.

37:51.159 --> 37:53.879
We have much information
to share with him.

37:53.880 --> 37:55.553
Fine.

37:55.554 --> 37:57.815
If that is what you wish...

37:59.193 --> 38:02.176
What do you want me to do with you?

38:02.177 --> 38:06.293
Shall I give you a flogging
until you turn beet red?

38:07.552 --> 38:09.672
Or twist your legs?

38:09.673 --> 38:12.340
Or just a good ol' clubbing.

38:14.835 --> 38:17.945
Or crush your kneecaps?

38:19.574 --> 38:21.386
- Get this off me!
- No.

38:21.387 --> 38:24.884
Or shall I brand you
with hot iron, perhaps?

38:26.365 --> 38:28.040
The lightest punishment
of all of those, please.

38:28.041 --> 38:31.100
- Flogging sounds good...
- No.

38:31.101 --> 38:33.937
It's inappropriate for a noblemen
to bare his bottom.

38:33.938 --> 38:36.872
Hand down something stronger
but more dignified.

38:36.873 --> 38:38.756
Please ignore him!
He's gone mad with fear.

38:38.757 --> 38:40.571
We'll go with the flogging!

38:40.572 --> 38:42.534
- Attention!
- Yes, sir!

38:43.536 --> 38:48.817
Give them everything so that
they learn their lesson!

38:49.907 --> 38:51.951
May I have a word?

38:56.719 --> 38:59.480
Welcome.
We've been waiting for you.

38:59.481 --> 39:03.330
If you'll let me handle the matter,
then I'll take care of it myself.

39:03.331 --> 39:05.357
Just turn a blind eye this time.

39:05.358 --> 39:07.971
But he has committed a serious crime...

39:07.972 --> 39:11.043
Haven't I said that
I will bear the responsibility?

39:12.782 --> 39:15.907
Do not let anyone in here.

39:18.458 --> 39:20.695
I owe you again, sir.

39:27.681 --> 39:30.004
What are you doing here?

39:30.005 --> 39:32.448
I took care of you like I promised.

39:32.449 --> 39:35.817
But how can you escape
from exile like this?

39:35.818 --> 39:38.730
Good sir, the bandits you arrested
a few months ago...

39:38.731 --> 39:41.430
- The scale of it...
- If they were let go that easily

39:41.431 --> 39:43.746
then I'm sure there's someone
who has their back.

39:44.704 --> 39:49.334
Why did you escape from exile
at a dangerous time like this?

39:49.335 --> 39:52.619
I could get in trouble
for helping you.

39:55.103 --> 39:57.053
Counterfeit silver is starting
its way back into circulation.

39:57.054 --> 40:01.991
It means the counterfeits
are being manufactured in Joseon.

40:01.992 --> 40:03.997
I shall investigate
the Japanese Settlement.

40:03.998 --> 40:05.618
The Japanese Settlement?

40:05.619 --> 40:10.087
I know what you're trying to do,
but the settlement is a bit different.

40:10.088 --> 40:12.049
It's in Joseon, but the land
doesn't belong to Joseon.

40:12.050 --> 40:13.703
How about this?

40:13.704 --> 40:17.339
I'll... look into
the Japanese Settlement myself.

40:17.340 --> 40:21.029
Please just... go back to your islet.

40:21.030 --> 40:22.672
I'll do that.

40:24.891 --> 40:29.305
I'm grateful that you would
listen to me.

40:29.306 --> 40:31.568
Let's have dinner together soon.

40:33.380 --> 40:34.671
Soon when?

40:34.672 --> 40:36.739
Just whenever you're free...

40:36.740 --> 40:39.556
So, when is good for you?

40:44.561 --> 40:46.756
He looks to be a well-educated man

40:46.757 --> 40:49.126
but he's pretty dense.
Has he always been like that?

41:15.885 --> 41:17.803
- Hurry.
- Let's go.

41:17.804 --> 41:19.340
- What's going on?
- Hurry along.

41:19.820 --> 41:21.430
Hold on, ma'am.

41:21.431 --> 41:23.125
What's going on?

41:23.126 --> 41:26.888
It's another corpse.
Another one has washed ashore.

41:26.889 --> 41:30.227
- A corpse?
- It's so creepy.

41:30.228 --> 41:33.706
One by one, bodies of little girls
have been washed ashore lately.

41:45.077 --> 41:46.663
What's going on?

41:55.335 --> 41:57.862
You'll get a good flogging
if you speak of this.

41:59.302 --> 42:00.933
Maybe it's been in the water
for too long.

42:00.934 --> 42:03.119
The corpse is all blue.

42:07.436 --> 42:11.372
It's probably not Da Hae.
She's a clever girl.

42:11.373 --> 42:13.442
Let's go over to
the Magistrate's office.

42:14.219 --> 42:15.318
Again?

42:20.297 --> 42:22.765
We must get in there to check the body.

42:22.766 --> 42:25.092
But I can't be caught again.

42:37.369 --> 42:38.679
[Suspicious Lady Kim]

42:42.391 --> 42:43.585
Follow me.

43:11.135 --> 43:14.346
It's not her, right?
Let's go then.

43:16.530 --> 43:18.855
Something isn't right.

43:18.856 --> 43:20.510
There's no sign of foaming at the mouth.

43:22.451 --> 43:24.508
When water suddenly enters the lungs

43:24.509 --> 43:28.785
there's irritation in the mucus membrane of
the airways, which causes the mouth to foam.

43:28.786 --> 43:31.686
This child was already dead
when she was thrown into the water.

43:34.215 --> 43:35.556
It's poison.

43:35.557 --> 43:39.033
The poison seeped through her skin
over a long period of time.

43:39.034 --> 43:43.428
What kind of poison?
Her lips haven't lost its color.

43:43.429 --> 43:44.986
Smells like raw almonds.

43:44.987 --> 43:47.034
As expected, it's cyanide.

43:48.623 --> 43:51.629
Unlike other forms of poison,
cyanide doesn't react with blood.

43:51.630 --> 43:53.004
Thus it doesn't discolor the skin.

43:53.005 --> 43:56.055
There are more readily accessible
poisons like aconite.

43:56.056 --> 43:57.517
So why use cyanide?

43:57.518 --> 44:00.780
Cyanide is a solvent
used in smelting silver.

44:01.615 --> 44:04.556
Smelting process?
If that's the case...

44:05.355 --> 44:06.899
This is only a suspicion

44:06.900 --> 44:09.522
but I believe this child was used in
the production of counterfeit silver.

44:09.523 --> 44:13.225
That's how she died, and her body was
thrown in the ocean when to end up here.

44:13.226 --> 44:15.442
What kind of a monster
would do this to a child?

44:15.443 --> 44:17.117
We must hurry.

44:25.846 --> 44:28.710
[Japanese Settlement]

44:31.710 --> 44:34.918
This place doesn't feel like Joseon.

44:35.536 --> 44:39.396
Virtually all trading done with Japan
takes place here.

44:40.070 --> 44:43.533
It used to be that entry access
was strictly controlled

44:43.534 --> 44:45.934
but it appears those laws
have relaxed.

44:47.469 --> 44:50.410
It isn't a small crime ring
we're dealing with.

44:50.411 --> 44:52.437
There's bound to be
a trace here somewhere.

44:52.438 --> 44:55.041
I'll look into it first thing
in the morning.

44:57.184 --> 44:58.868
My lord.

44:58.869 --> 45:02.408
Don't worry. I'll bring back
Da Hae and the other children.

45:02.409 --> 45:04.340
Come on, then.

45:06.295 --> 45:07.624
What is it?

45:07.625 --> 45:09.234
What the heck?

45:09.235 --> 45:11.421
What are you staring at?

45:11.422 --> 45:13.959
- I can never like you people.
- Pardon us.

45:13.960 --> 45:16.955
He's a half-wit.

45:16.956 --> 45:19.911
People throw stones at him
when he passes.

45:21.447 --> 45:22.619
See?

45:26.353 --> 45:29.200
Wow, my lord.
You speak Japanese?

45:29.201 --> 45:31.236
I never studied it exclusively

45:31.237 --> 45:34.052
but I picked up a few words
from my extensive reading.

45:36.409 --> 45:38.617
So you're calling yourself a genius?

45:47.257 --> 45:50.136
Can I get silver bullions from Japan?

45:50.137 --> 45:51.277
Sorry?

45:52.771 --> 45:57.004
They're transported directly
to a high-security warehouse.

45:57.005 --> 45:59.863
You said you used to smelt silver?

45:59.864 --> 46:02.423
That was a long time ago.

46:05.188 --> 46:06.699
Cyanide...

46:07.831 --> 46:09.642
It's like a mark.

46:09.643 --> 46:14.197
If it appears on your body,
then you'll soon meet the Grim Reaper.

46:15.617 --> 46:18.154
Only those who are used
to the fumes can stand it.

46:18.155 --> 46:22.484
Usually people faint upon
their first exposure to the fumes.

46:22.485 --> 46:24.970
Not to mention the children.

46:24.971 --> 46:28.811
Of course not. The little ones
probably won't even last a week.

46:32.106 --> 46:35.122
Is there a process
that requires only child laborers?

46:35.123 --> 46:38.578
Things only little girls can do,
not fully grown adults.

46:38.579 --> 46:40.349
No such thing.

46:41.387 --> 46:45.105
Can I... help you with anything?

46:45.106 --> 46:47.389
This is very nice.

47:02.757 --> 47:04.858
What's going on here?

47:09.967 --> 47:11.577
Is that a woman?

47:12.077 --> 47:16.877
An unusually large topknot
suggests it's a woman with long hair.

47:16.878 --> 47:20.535
Her narrow strides suggest she wears
a kimono, and therefore, Japanese.

47:20.536 --> 47:22.958
- More importantly...
- Yes?

47:25.188 --> 47:27.617
When I bumped into her...

47:28.501 --> 47:31.360
- Squishy!
- You pervert.

47:34.827 --> 47:36.139
Let's go, pervert.

47:42.090 --> 47:45.299
Silver bullions are sent directly
to a secret warehouse.

47:45.300 --> 47:47.413
Let's investigate the ferry first.

47:50.485 --> 47:53.009
Hurry up! We haven't got all day!

47:53.010 --> 47:55.079
Let's go out for drinks later!

48:08.114 --> 48:09.617
Keep up the good work!

48:10.235 --> 48:12.932
Unload the silver bars!

48:29.498 --> 48:31.160
What's up with this guy?

48:31.161 --> 48:32.653
Piss off!

48:37.371 --> 48:39.117
That's cold.

48:41.177 --> 48:44.054
- Take this.
- Why thank you.

48:57.226 --> 48:59.687
I'm much indebted to you.

48:59.688 --> 49:03.806
Could I treat you to a cup of...

49:06.088 --> 49:07.655
tea?

49:09.275 --> 49:10.859
Long time, no see.

49:10.860 --> 49:13.089
You look even more beautiful.

49:13.090 --> 49:16.844
Don't mention it.
You'll stop by later?

49:22.378 --> 49:24.177
Who is she?

49:31.646 --> 49:35.493
I looked everywhere but I didn't find
any place that deals in cyanide

49:35.494 --> 49:37.520
or found any children
around Da Hae's age.

49:37.521 --> 49:40.156
- We must find the bullion.
- What for?

49:40.157 --> 49:44.080
We'll get a fake bullion
and track it back to its origin.

49:44.081 --> 49:45.392
Where do we find one?

49:45.393 --> 49:47.824
In the warehouse where the silver
from the ferry is stored.

49:55.068 --> 49:56.486
We're robbing that place?

49:56.487 --> 49:59.419
The silver from Japan is stored here
until it's transported to Hanyang.

49:59.420 --> 50:01.980
It's the only place
we can obtain the bullion.

50:03.900 --> 50:05.049
What's the plan?

50:05.050 --> 50:06.820
We'll take down the guards and move in.

50:09.336 --> 50:10.529
They're all armed.

50:10.530 --> 50:12.087
With empty barrels!

50:12.088 --> 50:14.768
Do you know how much a bullet costs?
They wouldn't be that wasteful.

50:29.505 --> 50:31.691
Shit, they're shooting at us.

50:31.692 --> 50:35.340
Shouldn't they at least ask
who we are first?

50:36.268 --> 50:38.708
You said they wouldn't shoot
because their barrels were empty.

50:40.492 --> 50:44.031
You don't look so good.
You might want to see a doctor.

50:44.032 --> 50:47.082
I'm fine. I know my own body.

50:47.083 --> 50:50.003
- I don't think you do.
- What do you know?

50:50.827 --> 50:54.344
- But it's right in my face.
- I said I'm fine...

50:59.518 --> 51:01.447
Are you all right?

51:04.788 --> 51:08.754
You're lucky that the bullet
only grazed you.

51:08.755 --> 51:10.417
It would have been worse
with other people.

51:10.418 --> 51:12.209
They wouldn't have been
able to dodge it.

51:12.210 --> 51:14.097
I'm sure.

51:16.626 --> 51:19.897
Go back to the warehouse

51:19.898 --> 51:23.291
and find out who has access
to the silver bullions.

51:30.418 --> 51:34.151
That pig controls
the entry and exit points.

51:34.152 --> 51:36.102
He's as greedy as he looks.

51:36.103 --> 51:38.097
Maybe he smuggles out bullions, too.

51:42.182 --> 51:43.279
Over there!

51:43.280 --> 51:46.512
He's the watchdog.

51:47.494 --> 51:50.320
He looks like the suspicious type.

51:52.623 --> 51:54.202
What about him?

51:58.628 --> 52:00.547
Oh, that one is in charge of transport.

52:01.432 --> 52:05.112
But he's a typical government official,
so I wouldn't suspect him.

52:06.711 --> 52:08.557
- It's him.
- Sorry?

52:09.516 --> 52:11.551
Find out where he gambles.

52:11.552 --> 52:12.833
Gambles?

52:13.454 --> 52:15.156
Look at his ankles.

52:15.157 --> 52:17.971
There are callous built around the bone.

52:17.972 --> 52:20.447
It means they've been
under pressure for a long time.

52:23.106 --> 52:25.460
He has an interesting habit
when he checks his hand.

52:28.190 --> 52:31.731
He looks like an upright man,
but he is hot-tempered.

52:36.893 --> 52:38.044
There we go.

52:38.045 --> 52:40.885
If we stay close, then we may just be
able to get a sliver bar from him.

52:44.036 --> 52:46.111
Do you know how to gamble, my lord?

52:46.112 --> 52:48.372
Gambling is all about probability.

52:48.373 --> 52:51.229
Get your calculations right,
and you can never lose money.

52:51.230 --> 52:52.848
Wait here.

52:52.849 --> 52:54.780
I'll get the bullion,
so it won't be long.

52:57.286 --> 52:59.612
I'm going to go take a bath.

53:21.264 --> 53:22.488
Just 20 nyang more.

53:22.489 --> 53:24.792
You're cleaned out already?

53:24.793 --> 53:27.064
Just think of it as the cost
of my observation.

53:27.065 --> 53:28.877
In that short a time?

53:28.878 --> 53:30.746
You lost it from
acting too frivolously.

53:31.708 --> 53:34.456
I'll show you what probability
in a game is about.

53:37.530 --> 53:40.001
He's just a little dim.

53:42.851 --> 53:44.568
Hot, hot, hot!

53:50.541 --> 53:53.773
Why...

53:56.952 --> 53:59.626
Another 20 nyang.
This is the last time.

54:00.876 --> 54:03.637
I thought you said you were going to
show me what real probability is!

54:04.889 --> 54:06.538
Can't beat the lucky ones.

54:06.539 --> 54:09.813
Here... help me out.

54:11.092 --> 54:13.258
Leave the game if you're out of money.

54:13.259 --> 54:15.221
Should I deal out the cards?

54:25.981 --> 54:27.688
Mind if I join you?

54:30.871 --> 54:34.440
- You're...
- If you want, we'll start a new round.

54:36.692 --> 54:39.087
Be careful.
She's no ordinary woman.

54:39.088 --> 54:42.213
Don't be distracted...
I see you're not.

54:45.849 --> 54:50.485
All right.
Place your bets if you want to see my hand.

54:52.963 --> 54:54.175
You're out?

54:55.103 --> 54:56.905
Fold if you're shitting your pants.

55:02.163 --> 55:06.248
Let me see that winning hand of yours.

55:08.679 --> 55:10.054
Lay them out.

55:19.003 --> 55:21.125
I think she played
a sleight of hand...

55:24.164 --> 55:25.380
Get the lot.

55:26.565 --> 55:28.389
Thank you for the game.

55:33.465 --> 55:34.850
How did you do that?

55:34.851 --> 55:38.295
What do you mean?
I just got lucky, is all.

55:50.239 --> 55:51.984
This is unbelievable.

55:51.985 --> 55:54.407
We have to be elsewhere.

56:04.827 --> 56:05.922
Wait!

56:06.608 --> 56:08.672
- Is that all of you?
- What are you doing?

56:23.157 --> 56:24.318
Hot!

56:57.335 --> 56:58.380
What's going on?

56:59.135 --> 57:01.344
- Destroy it!
- Take it down!

57:08.983 --> 57:10.835
What? Where did they go?

57:11.998 --> 57:13.971
I think we've lost them.

57:14.451 --> 57:15.731
It's okay now.

57:19.143 --> 57:20.791
Thank you.

57:22.626 --> 57:27.233
I believe you're Japanese,
but your Korean is quite good.

57:27.809 --> 57:30.369
But who are you to help us?

57:35.594 --> 57:39.914
Perhaps there will be a day...
when I tell you everything.

57:41.552 --> 57:44.278
But... I shall get going for now.

57:52.833 --> 57:54.763
Did you do anything?

57:54.764 --> 57:56.415
Anything at all?

57:56.416 --> 57:58.506
You raunchy bastard.

57:58.507 --> 58:00.556
Let's get out of here.

58:07.692 --> 58:09.152
My lord.

58:32.552 --> 58:34.301
Welcome.

58:34.302 --> 58:37.051
We hope you've enjoyed your stay.
Come visit again another time.

58:37.052 --> 58:40.295
This is where the ferry crew
spends their time.

58:40.635 --> 58:42.694
You have the silver bar, right?

58:42.695 --> 58:45.041
Of course.
After all the trouble we went through...

58:46.396 --> 58:47.696
It's gone.

58:47.697 --> 58:51.623
Perhaps there will be a day...
when I tell you everything.

58:57.864 --> 58:58.896
Look at you.

59:15.748 --> 59:19.042
Men are such interesting creatures.

59:19.043 --> 59:23.683
You'd think one would lose their appetite
after making such a crucial mistake.

59:23.684 --> 59:26.167
But you're still hungry.

59:26.168 --> 59:28.194
Have you had enough?

59:28.195 --> 59:29.592
You should have some more, huh?

59:56.193 --> 59:57.333
Good sir.

59:59.637 --> 01:00:02.004
Have you come to investigate
the fake silver?

01:00:02.005 --> 01:00:03.849
I told you I would take care of it.

01:00:05.813 --> 01:00:07.657
Please return to your islet.

01:00:08.510 --> 01:00:10.642
The Norons are looking for
any excuse to catch you.

01:00:10.643 --> 01:00:12.337
You think they'd let you be?

01:00:12.338 --> 01:00:14.013
But you have my back.

01:00:14.014 --> 01:00:15.315
You want us to go down together?

01:00:17.586 --> 01:00:21.308
There seems to be more than one group
involved in the fake silver manufacturing.

01:00:21.309 --> 01:00:25.573
I'll go to the gisaeng house
and find out who is involved.

01:00:25.574 --> 01:00:27.268
Why go there?

01:00:27.269 --> 01:00:30.640
Traders and the crew on
the ferry seem to frequent there.

01:00:30.641 --> 01:00:32.177
I'm sure I'll find a clue there.

01:00:32.797 --> 01:00:34.991
I'm a prisoner in exile.

01:00:34.992 --> 01:00:37.710
I cannot come forward
even if I solve this case.

01:00:38.914 --> 01:00:43.105
If this case is a success,
you'll take all the credit.

01:00:43.106 --> 01:00:44.939
Understood.

01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:48.641
I'll prepare everything
to get you the help you need.

01:00:54.740 --> 01:00:58.067
Who is the most beautiful gisaeng here?

01:00:58.068 --> 01:01:00.980
What?
I don't understand what you're saying.

01:01:00.981 --> 01:01:02.781
- Send in another...
- My lord.

01:01:02.782 --> 01:01:04.436
Tell another to come in.

01:01:09.353 --> 01:01:11.314
Stop being such a show-off.

01:01:11.315 --> 01:01:12.678
There's always one person
who's like this.

01:01:12.679 --> 01:01:14.768
Someone who comes in
and speaks in a foreign language.

01:01:14.769 --> 01:01:18.437
We came here to acquire clues
about the Japanese.

01:01:18.438 --> 01:01:21.519
Where else would we find a gisaeng
who can speak Japanese?

01:01:25.668 --> 01:01:28.600
Who is the most beautiful gisaeng here?

01:01:28.601 --> 01:01:31.607
The... best? Uhm...

01:01:31.608 --> 01:01:33.399
Send in another gisaeng.

01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:35.031
Send in another gisaeng.

01:01:35.032 --> 01:01:36.663
Send in another gisaeng.

01:01:36.664 --> 01:01:39.726
- Send in another gisaeng.
- Send in another gisaeng.

01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:42.422
Welcome, gentlemen.

01:01:42.423 --> 01:01:46.700
You've come to the right place.

01:01:46.701 --> 01:01:50.391
I'm the most beautiful
gisaeng in this house.

01:01:52.715 --> 01:01:54.902
- Send in another gisaeng!
- Send in another gisaeng!

01:01:58.322 --> 01:02:00.604
I'm Sakura.

01:02:00.605 --> 01:02:02.161
About that...

01:02:02.708 --> 01:02:03.732
The food is quite delicious.

01:02:03.733 --> 01:02:07.290
But is a cook allowed out of the kitchen?
Get back into the kitchen.

01:02:07.291 --> 01:02:12.358
Are you planning on rejecting
all the gisaengs of this establishment?

01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:31.501
Aren't... you that thief?

01:02:33.260 --> 01:02:36.684
Has stealing from me
done you any good?

01:02:37.355 --> 01:02:38.940
My name is Hisako.

01:02:47.132 --> 01:02:48.453
You startled me.

01:02:48.454 --> 01:02:50.256
I quit drinking.

01:02:50.257 --> 01:02:52.261
- Let me fill your cup.
- I said I've quit.

01:02:52.262 --> 01:02:56.293
Is this where you meant for us
to have our heart-to-heart?

01:02:57.795 --> 01:03:00.280
With so many eyes watching us?

01:03:07.159 --> 01:03:09.910
We have drinks, but no music.

01:03:09.911 --> 01:03:12.171
Can you play something, zither player?

01:03:12.172 --> 01:03:13.888
You there.

01:03:13.889 --> 01:03:16.525
Yes, you.
The one not making eye contact.

01:03:17.536 --> 01:03:19.851
He is blind.

01:03:21.385 --> 01:03:23.018
How unfortunate.

01:03:33.896 --> 01:03:37.201
Look at you. You must work out.

01:03:37.202 --> 01:03:38.897
I don't exercise.

01:03:38.898 --> 01:03:41.617
I'm covered with bed sores
from lying around all day.

01:03:43.653 --> 01:03:45.605
I need to take a leak.

01:03:45.606 --> 01:03:48.986
- I'll come with you.
- My lord!

01:03:48.987 --> 01:03:53.519
I've held onto my virginity
just for this moment with you!

01:03:54.586 --> 01:03:56.484
You seriously look like
my younger brother.

01:03:56.485 --> 01:03:58.414
Ma'am, please!

01:04:02.958 --> 01:04:07.542
Do you know what the biggest giveaway is
when one only pretends to be blind?

01:04:07.543 --> 01:04:09.973
When a blind man hears a sound

01:04:09.974 --> 01:04:12.859
his eyes naturally move towards
the direction of that sound.

01:04:12.860 --> 01:04:16.392
But pretenders refrain from doing that.

01:04:16.393 --> 01:04:17.757
Just like you.

01:04:19.016 --> 01:04:22.460
It's you, my lord.
I wondered who you might be.

01:04:25.670 --> 01:04:29.873
The sound of your fist is amazing.

01:04:36.965 --> 01:04:38.584
Can't find your shoes
because you can't see?

01:04:38.585 --> 01:04:41.027
Those are your shoes. Wear them.

01:04:44.014 --> 01:04:47.638
My lord... why are you doing this to me?

01:04:47.639 --> 01:04:49.474
Why do you pretend to be blind?

01:04:50.735 --> 01:04:54.591
It gives off an air of
greater musicality.

01:04:54.592 --> 01:05:00.595
Call it... a sense of
mysticism, my lord.

01:05:00.596 --> 01:05:03.654
Please, my livelihood depends on it.

01:05:03.655 --> 01:05:07.419
- Can't you keep this a secret between us?
- I will keep it a secret.

01:05:07.420 --> 01:05:09.842
But will you do for me in return?

01:05:13.032 --> 01:05:15.196
But I know nothing.

01:05:15.197 --> 01:05:17.159
I haven't even asked you anything yet.

01:05:18.876 --> 01:05:21.381
About that woman, Hisako...

01:05:21.382 --> 01:05:25.326
I only know that she's from Japan...

01:05:25.327 --> 01:05:26.788
Japan?

01:05:26.789 --> 01:05:29.401
Is she so frightening that
she'd make your teeth chatter in fear?

01:05:29.402 --> 01:05:32.493
My lord, I really don't know anything.

01:05:32.494 --> 01:05:34.850
I just come and play the music
when I'm called.

01:05:34.851 --> 01:05:36.397
That's all.

01:05:36.398 --> 01:05:38.326
- What are you doing here?
- Pardon?

01:05:38.327 --> 01:05:41.580
I called him to see if he can
teach me to play the zither.

01:05:41.581 --> 01:05:42.966
Indeed.

01:05:42.967 --> 01:05:45.389
That's correct.
I should get going then.

01:05:50.661 --> 01:05:52.502
Did you know that he isn't blind?

01:05:52.503 --> 01:05:55.009
How can you not notice
when his acting is that bad?

01:05:55.648 --> 01:05:58.761
Let's go back inside.
I have many questions for you.

01:05:58.762 --> 01:06:02.804
I'd love to... but as you see,
I'm rather popular here.

01:06:03.871 --> 01:06:05.972
You must make a reservation
for a future date.

01:06:07.592 --> 01:06:08.947
Wait.

01:06:10.641 --> 01:06:13.666
Do you by any chance,
pack a hard slap?

01:06:24.876 --> 01:06:26.293
A tear-jerker.

01:06:33.175 --> 01:06:35.550
Hand, you remembered.

01:06:57.800 --> 01:06:59.844
Geez.

01:07:12.398 --> 01:07:14.041
Name.

01:07:14.541 --> 01:07:18.826
People call me the zither player.

01:07:18.827 --> 01:07:19.872
Age.

01:07:19.873 --> 01:07:21.482
Year of the Monkey.

01:07:21.483 --> 01:07:24.083
Do the Japanese ferry crew members
often come to the gisang house?

01:07:25.590 --> 01:07:28.477
- Hurry up and answer!
- Geez.

01:07:28.478 --> 01:07:30.513
Seeing as they're regulars

01:07:30.514 --> 01:07:32.412
many of them stay at the gibang

01:07:32.413 --> 01:07:34.672
until the ship sails back to Japan.

01:07:34.673 --> 01:07:36.165
Who do they usually meet with?

01:07:36.166 --> 01:07:38.553
Gisaengs, if they've come
to a gibang.

01:07:38.554 --> 01:07:39.652
Anyone else?

01:07:39.653 --> 01:07:41.305
I'll give you a smack!

01:07:41.306 --> 01:07:43.749
They spend the most of their time
with the gisaengs

01:07:43.750 --> 01:07:45.721
and it's the gisaengs
who know them best.

01:07:45.722 --> 01:07:48.314
What I'm asking is,
is there anything suspicious

01:07:48.315 --> 01:07:50.383
going on at the gisang house?

01:07:50.384 --> 01:07:53.571
Perhaps a secret place
where children make fake silver...

01:07:53.572 --> 01:07:54.596
Hey!

01:07:54.597 --> 01:07:56.581
Fake... silver?

01:07:58.179 --> 01:07:59.468
You dense fool.

01:07:59.469 --> 01:08:02.026
If you speak a word
about having talked to us

01:08:02.027 --> 01:08:04.096
then we'll tell everyone
that you're a fraud.

01:08:04.097 --> 01:08:06.122
Seriously, why are you doing this to me?

01:08:06.123 --> 01:08:07.446
I'll ask one more question.

01:08:07.447 --> 01:08:09.716
Tell me what kind of a woman Hisako is.

01:08:09.717 --> 01:08:13.663
She only arrived here
a few months ago.

01:08:15.072 --> 01:08:17.236
I'm not sure if she's really Japanese.

01:08:17.237 --> 01:08:19.519
But I heard she was
very famous even back in Japan.

01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:22.323
No one seems to know
why she came to Joseon.

01:08:23.078 --> 01:08:26.790
She's a top gisaeng who only
entertains Japanese guests.

01:08:26.791 --> 01:08:31.035
She has a temper of a lioness.
No one messes with her.

01:08:31.036 --> 01:08:36.015
But most importantly,
after observing her from up close

01:08:36.015 --> 01:08:38.596
she is...

01:08:39.506 --> 01:08:41.091
an incredible beauty.

01:08:42.189 --> 01:08:43.563
Right?

01:08:43.564 --> 01:08:44.984
You have a good eye.

01:08:49.795 --> 01:08:51.752
Is she seeing anyone?

01:08:51.752 --> 01:08:54.237
Like I said, she's got a fiery temper.

01:08:54.238 --> 01:08:56.594
- What chance do I have?
- Oh, come on.

01:08:56.595 --> 01:08:58.595
You definitely have a chance.
No question about it.

01:08:59.435 --> 01:09:00.796
What?

01:09:00.798 --> 01:09:04.723
Why must I keep track
of Hisako's movements?

01:09:04.724 --> 01:09:07.826
Because she's got something
to do with the fake silver.

01:09:07.827 --> 01:09:10.545
That's complete nonsense.

01:09:10.546 --> 01:09:13.960
She might have a prickly temperament,
but she's not capable of doing that.

01:09:15.069 --> 01:09:17.041
I'm sure that bitch is
capable of anything.

01:09:17.042 --> 01:09:19.889
Who she meets,
what they do together

01:09:19.890 --> 01:09:21.425
and what she does when she's alone...

01:09:21.426 --> 01:09:23.707
Report everything to me
and don't leave anything out.

01:09:48.408 --> 01:09:50.085
Good work.

01:10:55.543 --> 01:10:56.850
My lord...

01:10:56.851 --> 01:10:58.739
My lord.

01:11:04.671 --> 01:11:06.747
Who was it?
Who's responsible for this?

01:11:09.404 --> 01:11:11.728
I was watching Miss Hisako.

01:11:11.729 --> 01:11:16.635
She retired to her room
so I was about to leave myself

01:11:16.636 --> 01:11:19.566
when suddenly, someone put
a noose around my neck...

01:11:19.567 --> 01:11:22.915
I would have died tonight
if it hadn't been for you.

01:11:22.916 --> 01:11:24.632
Did you see anything?

01:11:25.572 --> 01:11:27.576
No, not really...

01:11:27.577 --> 01:11:30.145
You must have
if they were trying to kill you.

01:11:30.146 --> 01:11:32.152
There was nothing like that.

01:11:32.153 --> 01:11:34.198
Can I get more pickles?

01:11:34.199 --> 01:11:36.941
Are you sure you really almost died?

01:11:36.942 --> 01:11:40.834
I need to eat up since
I never know when I'll end up dead.

01:11:40.835 --> 01:11:42.626
All right. Eat up then.

01:11:42.627 --> 01:11:45.600
It has to be her, doesn't it?

01:11:45.601 --> 01:11:49.261
They wouldn't need a horse,
if it was someone stronger.

01:11:50.230 --> 01:11:53.482
- We need a new place to stay.
- I'll arrange it.

01:11:53.483 --> 01:11:56.202
While we're on the topic,
can I have more rice?

01:11:56.203 --> 01:11:58.323
You just had a whole pot
by yourself!

01:11:58.324 --> 01:11:59.987
Do you eat a pot a day?

01:11:59.988 --> 01:12:01.779
Stand guard around him.

01:12:01.780 --> 01:12:03.529
Whoever wanted him dead
will come back.

01:12:04.514 --> 01:12:08.541
If it's okay... some more rice?

01:12:08.542 --> 01:12:10.608
I might kill him before they get to him.
Come here, you.

01:12:10.609 --> 01:12:12.125
Come here.

01:12:37.788 --> 01:12:40.035
- The ship has capsized.
- Treasures fell into the water.

01:12:40.036 --> 01:12:41.689
- Tons of silk!
- Ginseng, too.

01:12:49.100 --> 01:12:50.890
It's the ferry.

01:12:50.891 --> 01:12:52.318
It brings in silver bullions

01:12:52.319 --> 01:12:55.787
and return with a shipload of fine goods,
including ginseng and textures.

01:12:56.841 --> 01:13:00.273
It must have capsized
sailing in stormy waters.

01:13:00.274 --> 01:13:03.194
They must've upset
the Dragon King Island.

01:13:03.195 --> 01:13:05.253
They had it coming.

01:13:06.042 --> 01:13:07.118
Dragon King Island?

01:13:07.119 --> 01:13:09.827
Far southeast of here

01:13:09.828 --> 01:13:12.943
is a place of very strong
currents that all of us avoid.

01:13:12.944 --> 01:13:14.500
The current is that strong there?

01:13:14.501 --> 01:13:16.612
Strong enough to destroy a ferry boat?

01:13:16.613 --> 01:13:20.536
I've never been there, so I don't know.
But that's what I heard.

01:13:20.537 --> 01:13:21.998
Who told you that?

01:13:24.557 --> 01:13:27.265
- You heard the story too, right?
- Of course.

01:13:27.266 --> 01:13:29.549
Even the children know about it.

01:13:29.550 --> 01:13:32.642
You've all heard about this island,
but no one's been there?

01:13:32.643 --> 01:13:35.979
Who in their right mind
would walk into their own death?

01:13:35.980 --> 01:13:38.167
We stay clear of the area.

01:13:51.979 --> 01:13:55.467
Move over! That's mine!

01:16:09.582 --> 01:16:12.143
Even in death, you can't even get
a small piece of land.

01:16:49.557 --> 01:16:51.882
I believe she was used in
the manufacturing of fake silver.

01:16:52.578 --> 01:16:55.902
She died, was tossed into the ocean,
and washed up ashore.

01:16:57.181 --> 01:16:59.719
Who in their right mind
would walk into their own deaths?

01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:01.437
I'm not sure if she
really is even Japanese.

01:17:01.438 --> 01:17:04.167
No one seems to know why
she's in Joseon.

01:17:11.269 --> 01:17:13.407
Oh my, oh my!

01:17:13.408 --> 01:17:15.360
Oh no!

01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:20.051
I told him that he couldn't come in.

01:17:21.332 --> 01:17:25.055
Our guest seems to be in a hurry.
Leave us.

01:17:29.095 --> 01:17:30.588
Tell me what you know.

01:17:32.733 --> 01:17:35.506
- Is that a threat?
- I'm asking you.

01:17:38.470 --> 01:17:41.604
Your request sounds
rather like a threat.

01:17:41.605 --> 01:17:44.026
I'm searching for a young girl.

01:17:44.027 --> 01:17:46.469
Then I hope you find her soon.

01:17:49.284 --> 01:17:51.099
I found her. Today.

01:17:54.971 --> 01:17:56.929
I found her and buried her.

01:17:56.930 --> 01:18:00.480
At the foot of a stony mountain.

01:18:00.481 --> 01:18:03.488
She shouldn't have died like that.

01:18:03.489 --> 01:18:05.247
She didn't deserve to die like that.

01:18:05.248 --> 01:18:07.082
What did you do?

01:18:08.096 --> 01:18:10.774
If she wasn't supposed
to die that way...

01:18:12.171 --> 01:18:14.313
then why did you let that happen to her?

01:18:14.314 --> 01:18:18.676
Her name was Da Hae.
She was looking for her sister.

01:18:22.368 --> 01:18:26.900
Seeing as she had this on her,
it means she had been here.

01:18:36.087 --> 01:18:40.477
Her sister was undoubtedly at
wherever she was headed.

01:18:40.478 --> 01:18:42.919
She must have been excited
to see her sister again.

01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:45.661
Not knowing that she'd be used
in making of the counterfeit silver.

01:18:46.845 --> 01:18:49.850
You stole that bullion from me
to hide the truth.

01:18:49.851 --> 01:18:53.092
Likely because I couldn't find out
that the bullion was a fake.

01:18:57.743 --> 01:19:02.091
From this moment on,
do not expect any sympathy from me.

01:19:13.662 --> 01:19:15.154
What happened?

01:19:15.155 --> 01:19:17.478
Before the authentic bullion
from Japan reach Taema-do

01:19:17.479 --> 01:19:19.377
they are switched with counterfeits.

01:19:19.378 --> 01:19:22.139
Are you saying the switch
is made on the boat?

01:19:22.140 --> 01:19:26.086
The boat could sink under
that kind of weight.

01:19:26.087 --> 01:19:28.764
Dragon King Island is where
the fake silver is manufactured.

01:19:28.765 --> 01:19:31.813
But I heard that no ship
can go near it.

01:19:31.814 --> 01:19:33.446
That is what I heard as well.

01:19:33.447 --> 01:19:35.845
The place everyone has heard of,
but have never been to.

01:19:35.846 --> 01:19:38.386
Young children are dying there.

01:19:39.100 --> 01:19:43.781
If that is true...
then this matter is way over your head.

01:19:43.782 --> 01:19:45.700
- I'll go first.
- Hold on.

01:19:45.701 --> 01:19:47.395
I'll dispatch the soldiers!

01:19:47.396 --> 01:19:51.972
It is far too dangerous for you.

01:19:53.956 --> 01:19:55.481
But that will be too late.

01:19:57.304 --> 01:19:59.448
I made a promise
to her older sister.

01:20:00.846 --> 01:20:03.006
I promised her that
I would find her sister.

01:20:03.007 --> 01:20:07.702
Would you risk your life
for a lowly slave girl?

01:20:10.559 --> 01:20:15.002
All lives are equally precious.

01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:22.670
I'll start with the owner
of the gibang.

01:20:31.938 --> 01:20:34.401
I gave him a chance to save himself.

01:20:34.402 --> 01:20:37.237
But he refuses to listen.

01:20:37.238 --> 01:20:44.076
It's been filled up for you,
so you're free to take it.

01:21:03.978 --> 01:21:06.920
What are you going to do
about Hisako?

01:21:06.921 --> 01:21:09.288
I need to prepare myself since
they'll be on the move, too.

01:21:09.289 --> 01:21:11.561
What is with this pressing music?

01:21:17.876 --> 01:21:20.556
I'm eating up all your food,
yet not doing anything in return, so...

01:21:25.735 --> 01:21:28.049
You're really trying my patience lately.

01:21:28.050 --> 01:21:30.054
Turning me into a monster.

01:21:30.055 --> 01:21:32.028
My neck! My neck!

01:21:34.350 --> 01:21:36.419
When I open the door to leave...

01:21:36.420 --> 01:21:37.635
that's one.

01:21:37.636 --> 01:21:40.227
When Hisako enters through the doors...

01:21:40.228 --> 01:21:41.346
that's two.

01:21:41.347 --> 01:21:44.398
And when she changes into
her disguise and then leaves...

01:21:44.399 --> 01:21:45.976
Three!

01:21:46.381 --> 01:21:49.921
The tube will spray luminous paint
on her disguise.

01:22:11.456 --> 01:22:12.555
One.

01:22:45.244 --> 01:22:50.172
This is a map created by
Japan's feudal government.

01:22:53.497 --> 01:22:55.491
They must've upset
the Dragon King Island.

01:22:55.492 --> 01:22:57.518
Even the children know about it.

01:23:06.015 --> 01:23:08.350
I only know that she's from Japan.

01:23:11.189 --> 01:23:12.242
Two.

01:23:42.297 --> 01:23:45.305
This can really complicate the matter.

01:23:50.530 --> 01:23:51.545
Three!

01:24:26.154 --> 01:24:27.177
My lord.

01:24:30.645 --> 01:24:32.252
It's me! Me!

01:24:33.585 --> 01:24:34.969
Why are you in there?

01:24:34.970 --> 01:24:37.230
This won't do.
Look, I'll put on the paint.

01:24:37.231 --> 01:24:38.277
This is me.

01:24:40.216 --> 01:24:42.599
- Where are you?
- Right here.

01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:45.001
You put it on, too! Hurry!

01:25:16.210 --> 01:25:18.487
I don't know who you are

01:25:18.488 --> 01:25:21.604
but you can't just try to take part of
our loot that we've been working on.

01:25:26.402 --> 01:25:28.009
Out of the frying pan
and into the fire.

01:25:32.112 --> 01:25:34.020
Boys, don't kill him too soon.

01:25:34.680 --> 01:25:37.858
Make his death slow, and excruciating.

01:25:46.103 --> 01:25:47.286
Get them!

01:25:47.287 --> 01:25:48.854
Stop right there!

01:26:01.119 --> 01:26:02.667
Where did they go?

01:26:24.724 --> 01:26:26.217
Who is it?

01:26:28.179 --> 01:26:31.046
How dare you barge
into my room at this hour.

01:26:31.047 --> 01:26:32.722
You must have a death wish.

01:26:36.305 --> 01:26:39.171
The government officials have arrived.

01:26:53.315 --> 01:26:54.900
They're gone.

01:26:58.921 --> 01:27:00.479
Thank you.

01:27:02.250 --> 01:27:04.297
Who was it that tried to kill you?

01:27:05.481 --> 01:27:07.998
Probably the same man
that wants you dead.

01:27:09.319 --> 01:27:11.791
So you were investigating
the fake silver, too.

01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:17.078
I still haven't figured out
why you're doing all this

01:27:20.474 --> 01:27:22.314
but... be careful.

01:27:25.378 --> 01:27:27.336
Tonight after midnight...

01:27:27.337 --> 01:27:29.801
another ferry boat
will leave for Taema-do.

01:27:31.998 --> 01:27:34.143
That was for saving my life.

01:28:19.475 --> 01:28:22.045
How did you get
beat up so badly?

01:28:22.046 --> 01:28:23.879
Shut up.

01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:26.428
I almost died today.

01:28:26.429 --> 01:28:27.751
That's a pity.

01:28:27.752 --> 01:28:30.236
I could've had hot beef soup
at your funeral.

01:28:30.237 --> 01:28:32.144
What, what did you say?

01:28:32.145 --> 01:28:33.660
You don't want this?

01:28:33.661 --> 01:28:36.260
Forget it, I'm just going to sleep.
I'm turning off the lights.

01:28:36.261 --> 01:28:37.852
But I'm still eating.

01:28:37.853 --> 01:28:39.693
You can still stuff your face
even in the dark.

01:28:53.604 --> 01:28:56.604
If you're going to eat,
you might as well eat in the light.

01:29:00.524 --> 01:29:02.364
You will?

01:29:07.398 --> 01:29:09.005
So, you've found out.

01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:13.832
Found out what?

01:29:15.751 --> 01:29:17.264
You've figured it all out, haven't you?

01:29:17.265 --> 01:29:19.471
Your quick wits
have gotten you this far.

01:29:19.472 --> 01:29:21.287
So I'm sure you've figured it all out.

01:29:33.552 --> 01:29:36.272
What are you talking about?

01:29:36.273 --> 01:29:39.994
Then... did you figure this out, too?

01:29:43.289 --> 01:29:46.651
You should've figured out when
your life was going to end.

01:29:46.652 --> 01:29:47.961
Shouldn't you?

01:29:55.448 --> 01:29:58.284
Ugh, this tastes like blood.

01:30:05.269 --> 01:30:07.104
Shut up!

01:30:34.302 --> 01:30:37.188
Dragon King Island...

01:30:37.189 --> 01:30:40.069
Used as a Japanese military base
during the war.

01:30:42.269 --> 01:30:44.313
But it's hard to access.

01:30:45.755 --> 01:30:47.895
Perhaps from higher a ground...

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:06.931
Come on, you little shits!
Move it already!

01:31:09.927 --> 01:31:12.411
Period?

01:31:12.412 --> 01:31:14.045
Over there.

01:31:16.923 --> 01:31:18.386
Have you had your period?

01:31:19.762 --> 01:31:20.837
There.

01:31:24.198 --> 01:31:25.507
Have you had your period?

01:31:33.463 --> 01:31:36.928
Your chest is firm
and you have dark circles.

01:31:36.929 --> 01:31:41.005
You have started your period.
How dare you lie to me?

01:31:41.804 --> 01:31:43.030
Over here.

01:31:50.698 --> 01:31:56.714
These are the girls
I'm sending to Japan.

01:31:56.715 --> 01:32:00.457
Clean them up so that
I can fetch a good price for them.

01:32:00.458 --> 01:32:04.243
Send this lot to the factory.

01:32:04.244 --> 01:32:05.310
Yes.

01:32:05.311 --> 01:32:07.348
Pedophilia.

01:32:07.349 --> 01:32:10.462
They didn't need young girls
for fake silver production.

01:32:10.463 --> 01:32:13.513
They use the girls who cannot
be sold for sex because of their age

01:32:13.514 --> 01:32:15.541
to manufacture fake silver.

01:32:46.470 --> 01:32:47.729
Dead.

01:32:48.594 --> 01:32:50.108
- Get her out of here.
- Yes, sir.

01:33:23.140 --> 01:33:24.655
Hurry up!

01:33:25.487 --> 01:33:26.703
Hurry up!

01:33:36.587 --> 01:33:38.069
Hurry.

01:33:40.692 --> 01:33:41.993
Do Hae?

01:33:43.293 --> 01:33:45.180
How do you know my name?

01:33:45.181 --> 01:33:46.760
Did you hear that?

01:33:48.465 --> 01:33:50.189
I'm sure I heard something.

01:33:53.270 --> 01:33:54.550
Search!

01:33:54.551 --> 01:33:55.648
- Yes.
- Yes.

01:33:55.649 --> 01:33:59.511
I swear I heard something here.

01:34:10.188 --> 01:34:11.764
You sneaky bitch!

01:34:11.765 --> 01:34:13.546
How dare you lock yourself in there?

01:34:13.547 --> 01:34:15.221
Follow me!

01:34:23.082 --> 01:34:24.541
I'm sorry.

01:34:24.542 --> 01:34:26.506
I'll be back for you,
so wait just a bit longer.

01:34:47.622 --> 01:34:49.421
The zither player!

01:34:53.931 --> 01:34:57.947
Did you enjoy your tour
of Dragon King Island?

01:34:57.948 --> 01:34:59.569
What have you done with Seo Pil?

01:35:01.884 --> 01:35:03.600
What do you think I've done?

01:35:07.578 --> 01:35:09.697
You simply don't bother
people while they're eating.

01:35:11.018 --> 01:35:15.486
He wouldn't stop babbling
so I put a hole in his neck.

01:35:15.487 --> 01:35:20.765
You sell young girls to
Japan for pedophile sex

01:35:20.766 --> 01:35:22.215
and use the others
to produce fake silver?

01:35:22.216 --> 01:35:24.083
You son of a bitch!

01:35:26.557 --> 01:35:28.425
A nobleman who knows how to swear!

01:35:39.868 --> 01:35:42.032
That's right. Now I remember.

01:35:42.033 --> 01:35:45.916
Your eyes looked familiar.

01:36:00.122 --> 01:36:03.354
Thanks to you, I was sold off to Japan.

01:36:04.337 --> 01:36:06.532
I should repay the favor.

01:36:13.310 --> 01:36:14.855
Don't move!

01:36:14.856 --> 01:36:17.650
Stop what you're doing.

01:36:21.649 --> 01:36:25.114
You arrived in such a timely manner.

01:36:25.115 --> 01:36:27.184
I'm beyond thrilled to see you.

01:36:27.185 --> 01:36:28.539
Prisoner Kim Min!

01:36:29.542 --> 01:36:32.826
You escaped from exile

01:36:32.827 --> 01:36:34.532
but you collaborated
with a Japanese woman

01:36:34.533 --> 01:36:41.230
to produce fake silver and
put this country's economy in jeopardy!

01:36:41.231 --> 01:36:42.587
My friend.

01:36:43.182 --> 01:36:46.095
It's me. Why are you doing this?

01:36:46.498 --> 01:36:48.769
He's the one heading up
the fake silver production.

01:36:48.770 --> 01:36:51.959
The government official
who has this bastard's back...

01:36:51.960 --> 01:36:55.371
was you.

01:36:55.372 --> 01:36:57.475
Do your job properly.

01:37:00.610 --> 01:37:02.541
Considering how much I pay you...

01:37:04.216 --> 01:37:05.867
What are you all doing?

01:37:05.868 --> 01:37:09.453
Arrest those two immediately!

01:37:21.856 --> 01:37:25.836
My name is Hwa Yeon,
a daughter of a slave.

01:37:28.769 --> 01:37:32.693
I was the one who gave
that girl that candy.

01:37:34.524 --> 01:37:37.572
The girl called Da Hae...

01:37:38.969 --> 01:37:41.033
came to see me.

01:37:59.922 --> 01:38:01.734
How old are you?

01:38:01.735 --> 01:38:03.570
I'm 12 years old.

01:38:04.509 --> 01:38:06.523
Why are you here?

01:38:06.524 --> 01:38:09.180
To find my little sister.

01:38:10.344 --> 01:38:13.533
I heard that I could
find my sister here.

01:38:15.025 --> 01:38:17.190
Was she taken away
on a boat, too?

01:38:18.257 --> 01:38:20.497
I'm... not sure.

01:38:34.554 --> 01:38:36.534
Thank you.

01:38:40.448 --> 01:38:43.260
I want to save it and give it
to my sister when I see her.

01:38:45.296 --> 01:38:47.962
All right.
Take care, little one.

01:38:52.211 --> 01:38:56.136
You're Korean, aren't you?

01:38:58.023 --> 01:38:59.462
No, I'm not.

01:39:04.591 --> 01:39:07.470
Why didn't you tell me this earlier?

01:39:07.471 --> 01:39:11.428
I'm sure you've trimmed
your fingernails before.

01:39:11.429 --> 01:39:13.295
What are you talking about?

01:39:14.277 --> 01:39:17.881
Children of slaves
never cut their nails.

01:39:19.287 --> 01:39:22.242
The nails wear off
before they can even grow.

01:39:22.243 --> 01:39:27.127
And the toenails are so bruised
before they can grow.

01:39:30.774 --> 01:39:36.118
Do you know how many children
get sold off for debt or hunger?

01:39:38.570 --> 01:39:42.761
At first, they blame their parents
for selling them off...

01:39:44.713 --> 01:39:47.422
but the moment they taste
white rice in their mouths...

01:39:48.247 --> 01:39:51.550
that grudge turns into gratitude.

01:39:53.672 --> 01:39:56.753
It's probably the best thing that
my parents have ever done for me.

01:40:01.595 --> 01:40:03.556
For a child who was
born as a slave

01:40:03.557 --> 01:40:06.820
there is no such thing as
a world that is better or worse.

01:40:08.005 --> 01:40:10.575
I was lucky to have been sent to
a Japanese official.

01:40:10.576 --> 01:40:13.945
And now, I am investigating the fake
silver case on their children's behalf.

01:40:18.921 --> 01:40:21.040
If I had stayed here...

01:40:21.041 --> 01:40:25.573
then I would have lived my life never
dreaming of what I could become.

01:40:26.832 --> 01:40:29.764
Could I... grow up
to become something?

01:40:29.765 --> 01:40:32.465
Don't be shy and tell me.

01:40:33.264 --> 01:40:36.388
It's not that I'm shy...

01:40:36.389 --> 01:40:39.663
It's just that I've never thought
about that before.

01:40:45.978 --> 01:40:47.257
Why did you do it?

01:40:49.667 --> 01:40:52.993
I used to look up to you
back in the day.

01:40:52.994 --> 01:40:56.854
You would put these poor children
in misery for money?

01:40:56.855 --> 01:40:58.379
Just money?

01:40:58.380 --> 01:41:00.478
You know as well as I do.

01:41:00.479 --> 01:41:04.331
I've gotten passed over
for the minister's position many times.

01:41:05.471 --> 01:41:07.977
I have no power
and no strings to pull.

01:41:07.978 --> 01:41:10.292
So how else can I possibly
become a minister?

01:41:10.911 --> 01:41:14.791
Money is power,
and money pulls strings.

01:41:14.792 --> 01:41:17.340
I know your type very well.

01:41:17.341 --> 01:41:19.452
Money is all that matters to you.

01:41:19.453 --> 01:41:22.855
You spineless scumbags!

01:41:24.149 --> 01:41:26.703
Rest easy.

01:41:26.704 --> 01:41:32.122
I brought in your old friends
to keep you company.

01:41:43.789 --> 01:41:44.911
I can't breathe!

01:41:46.819 --> 01:41:48.568
You should rest more.

01:41:48.569 --> 01:41:51.979
This is Hell.
I've died and gone to Hell.

01:41:51.980 --> 01:41:54.775
No, you haven't died yet.

01:41:57.250 --> 01:41:58.849
What happened?

01:41:58.850 --> 01:42:02.354
You came to see me
in your bleeding state.

01:42:02.355 --> 01:42:04.147
I did?

01:42:04.148 --> 01:42:08.756
I was touched that you'd
come see me before you died!

01:42:09.775 --> 01:42:11.340
I couldn't die with dignity?

01:42:12.300 --> 01:42:14.667
Have you seen my lord?

01:42:19.168 --> 01:42:20.864
Just a few more days.

01:42:26.815 --> 01:42:28.886
There are children
that needs to be saved.

01:42:31.231 --> 01:42:33.470
They're being sold for sex

01:42:33.471 --> 01:42:35.946
and dying while making fake silver.

01:42:35.947 --> 01:42:39.880
- Such poor souls...
- Look, noble lord.

01:42:39.881 --> 01:42:44.019
You'll risk your neck for
some slave's daughter?

01:42:44.020 --> 01:42:46.462
Tell me something I can believe.

01:42:47.219 --> 01:42:50.866
Hey, hey. Would you believe your words
if you were in my shoes?

01:42:50.867 --> 01:42:54.493
Those children are
citizens of Joseon, too!

01:43:01.756 --> 01:43:04.102
Remember every time
you look at that scar.

01:43:04.103 --> 01:43:07.771
Think of all those children who died
because of you!

01:43:36.793 --> 01:43:39.747
If you leave out even one nyang
from what you've promised

01:43:39.748 --> 01:43:42.306
then I'll break your neck.

01:43:42.307 --> 01:43:43.939
You understand?

01:43:54.309 --> 01:43:55.456
Every hour counts.

01:43:55.457 --> 01:43:59.157
First, I shall go to save the children.
Please take care of the fake silver.

01:44:05.363 --> 01:44:07.667
I'll take care of things on my end.

01:44:21.180 --> 01:44:23.782
Anyhow, it's impossible to
go near Dragon King Island.

01:44:23.783 --> 01:44:25.903
The only way we can ensure
that we don't get caught...

01:44:41.211 --> 01:44:43.535
What will you do?
The sun's coming up soon.

01:44:43.536 --> 01:44:45.125
We'll take the sky.

01:44:52.996 --> 01:44:56.483
Wait, wait, wait!
Didn't this crash into the rocks last time?

01:44:57.229 --> 01:44:59.346
This man!
It never once succeeded!

01:44:59.347 --> 01:45:00.956
Never failed either.

01:45:00.957 --> 01:45:02.844
I definitely saw it crash with my own eyes.
Get me out of this!

01:45:02.845 --> 01:45:05.961
I know why it failed,
so it's the same as being a succes.

01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:08.156
What a load of nonsense.

01:45:08.157 --> 01:45:09.712
Ah, hold on!

01:45:09.713 --> 01:45:11.580
How did you figure out
what went wrong?

01:45:11.581 --> 01:45:13.127
How did you find out?

01:45:17.755 --> 01:45:20.761
- Let's go!
- No, no, no!

01:45:22.470 --> 01:45:24.118
Here we go!

01:45:48.105 --> 01:45:50.334
Where do we land?

01:45:50.335 --> 01:45:52.020
I think somewhere down there!

01:45:55.091 --> 01:45:56.412
That's it!

01:45:58.563 --> 01:46:00.104
Can you land this thing?

01:46:00.105 --> 01:46:02.175
This is the first time I've flown it!

01:46:03.315 --> 01:46:05.993
I knew it, you fool!

01:46:20.626 --> 01:46:22.627
That wasn't too bad, was it?

01:46:24.565 --> 01:46:26.358
What are you talking about?

01:46:33.805 --> 01:46:35.649
Let's go. There's no time.

01:46:53.842 --> 01:46:55.804
Let's hurry it up.

01:46:55.805 --> 01:46:57.958
This needs to go over there.

01:46:58.458 --> 01:47:00.505
Let's go to Joseon!

01:47:00.506 --> 01:47:02.458
This is the entrance.

01:47:03.655 --> 01:47:06.126
First, place a fuse in a bamboo pipe.

01:47:06.127 --> 01:47:10.756
Put it in a bigger pipe, fill it with
gunpowder, and close it.

01:47:11.587 --> 01:47:14.562
It's recorded in the books
as 'Heaven-shattering Thunder.'

01:47:14.563 --> 01:47:18.264
A time-ticking bomb that's dependent
on the length of its wick.

01:47:22.135 --> 01:47:24.255
We'll separate here.
Don't forget...

01:47:24.256 --> 01:47:26.743
We only have fifteen minutes
from the time you light the wick.

01:47:47.382 --> 01:47:49.175
Looks good, huh?

01:47:49.578 --> 01:47:52.287
It's good for you,
so get in line to have some.

01:47:55.189 --> 01:47:56.842
I said line up!

01:47:57.322 --> 01:47:59.037
Hey you, come here.

01:47:59.038 --> 01:48:01.149
Get up. Open your mouth.
Come on.

01:48:01.150 --> 01:48:02.291
Open your mouth!

01:48:02.292 --> 01:48:04.499
You are an evil monster,
you awful witch.

01:48:04.500 --> 01:48:05.917
- Why I ought to...
- Goodness!

01:48:05.918 --> 01:48:09.523
My lord. Please spare me...

01:48:09.524 --> 01:48:12.390
I was only doing as I was told.

01:48:12.391 --> 01:48:14.621
I can't even hit you
because you're a woman.

01:48:15.335 --> 01:48:18.020
- Get out of my sight.
- Thank you, kind sir!

01:48:18.021 --> 01:48:19.289
Thank you.

01:48:25.234 --> 01:48:27.330
Are you all right?
What about Do Hae?

01:48:27.331 --> 01:48:28.654
Where is Do Hae?

01:48:31.073 --> 01:48:34.742
It's all right.
We're here to save you.

01:48:34.743 --> 01:48:40.332
Do Hae was caught running away
and taken to the factory.

01:48:44.502 --> 01:48:47.126
Listen up.
Everyone, follow this man out.

01:48:47.127 --> 01:48:48.672
You mustn't lose him.

01:48:49.475 --> 01:48:50.826
What are you going to do?

01:48:50.827 --> 01:48:54.078
We need a distraction
while we get these children get out.

01:48:54.079 --> 01:48:56.670
I'll distract the guards,
and find Do Hae.

01:48:56.671 --> 01:48:59.037
Escape with the children
and light the wick.

01:48:59.038 --> 01:49:01.843
My lord... can you get out
within fifteen minutes?

01:49:01.844 --> 01:49:03.827
- No, I cannot.
- What?

01:49:03.828 --> 01:49:05.246
Just do as I say.

01:49:15.421 --> 01:49:16.444
Let's go!

01:49:38.235 --> 01:49:41.158
Let's go, let's go.

01:50:00.301 --> 01:50:02.526
- Over there! Over there!
- Over there.

01:50:02.527 --> 01:50:03.805
Hurry!

01:50:03.806 --> 01:50:05.759
Hurry! Over there!

01:50:14.323 --> 01:50:16.081
Hide behind the rocks.

01:50:16.082 --> 01:50:17.969
Be careful. Careful.

01:50:17.970 --> 01:50:19.965
Hide in there! Hide!

01:50:50.201 --> 01:50:54.286
Jeez, you just won't die!

01:51:03.948 --> 01:51:09.836
Do you have any idea...
how much damage you've cost me?

01:51:15.926 --> 01:51:17.727
Do Hae, shall I tell you
a story that you know?

01:51:17.728 --> 01:51:20.616
- There was a well in a village.
- What is this crazy man saying?

01:51:20.617 --> 01:51:23.315
The villagers were having
problems with the rope to the well.

01:51:25.256 --> 01:51:29.297
But you know a clever girl called Da Hae
calculated the exact length of rope.

01:51:30.878 --> 01:51:32.229
Do you know how?

01:51:35.493 --> 01:51:38.384
If the rope is too short,
the bucket will dangle.

01:51:38.385 --> 01:51:39.451
Kill her!

01:51:44.005 --> 01:51:45.957
And it makes it easy to catch!

01:51:59.351 --> 01:52:00.801
You're clever like your sister...

01:52:01.475 --> 01:52:02.591
Jeez.

01:52:07.273 --> 01:52:08.564
Over here!

01:52:13.140 --> 01:52:15.100
He's a clever man,
so he must've thought of a way.

01:52:55.521 --> 01:52:57.921
Where do you think
you're crawling off to?

01:53:21.578 --> 01:53:22.707
Over there!

01:53:25.939 --> 01:53:29.054
Don't be scared.
You have to see your mother.

01:55:15.936 --> 01:55:17.430
My lord!

01:55:18.005 --> 01:55:20.233
- Are you all right?
- No, I'm not.

01:55:20.234 --> 01:55:23.326
- You look fine.
- I said I wasn't!

01:56:08.005 --> 01:56:09.316
Thank you.

01:56:09.317 --> 01:56:10.831
Attend to him.

01:56:10.832 --> 01:56:12.442
You don't have to do that.

01:56:14.756 --> 01:56:18.350
A gisaeng paid us good money
to save you.

01:56:19.331 --> 01:56:21.047
She seemed incredibly worried.

01:56:21.048 --> 01:56:22.925
Was she pretty or...

01:56:22.926 --> 01:56:24.408
Not really.

01:56:25.734 --> 01:56:26.945
Let's go.

01:56:31.800 --> 01:56:33.385
Not you.

01:56:33.386 --> 01:56:34.996
You have to pay up.

01:56:40.115 --> 01:56:42.067
They've already been covered.

01:56:42.068 --> 01:56:43.636
Who paid for them?

01:56:46.953 --> 01:56:48.532
I did.

01:56:52.413 --> 01:56:53.715
Let's go.

01:56:54.908 --> 01:56:58.950
Good sir, I'll compensate you generously
if you'd take me with you.

01:56:58.951 --> 01:57:00.838
Seo Pil, can't you cover for me?

01:57:05.604 --> 01:57:07.489
- Mom!
- Mom!

01:57:12.135 --> 01:57:13.443
Do Hae!

01:57:22.471 --> 01:57:25.988
But... what became of Hwa Yeon?

01:57:27.746 --> 01:57:33.099
She sympathized with the children
who suffered the same fate that she had.

01:57:33.984 --> 01:57:36.938
It would have been difficult
to convince the army otherwise

01:57:36.939 --> 01:57:39.359
without revealing that she was a spy.

01:57:44.435 --> 01:57:47.898
You remind me of a frilled lizard.

01:57:47.899 --> 01:57:51.482
This is the trend these days.
What do you think?

01:57:51.483 --> 01:57:53.381
It looks uncomfortable.

01:58:10.123 --> 01:58:12.594
Hold it!
She is a citizen of Joseon!

01:58:12.595 --> 01:58:15.079
She's the king's treasured subject,
so treat her with respect.

01:58:21.608 --> 01:58:23.024
Did you see her face?

01:58:23.025 --> 01:58:24.997
She's totally swept off her feet.

01:58:24.998 --> 01:58:27.175
My voice didn't quiver at the end?

01:58:28.220 --> 01:58:31.154
- It wasn't weird, right?
- Well, it wasn't great...

01:58:34.225 --> 01:58:37.563
Seeing that you're both alive,
I take it that the children are safe.

01:58:37.564 --> 01:58:40.452
Wait, what happened to your friend?

01:58:40.453 --> 01:58:42.649
As the detective has advised

01:58:42.650 --> 01:58:47.237
we confiscated his wealth
and distributed it to the poor.

01:58:48.313 --> 01:58:50.679
It bought back the freedom for many slaves

01:58:50.680 --> 01:58:55.340
and I thought we'd be able to feed all the
hungry families for a while, but sadly...

01:58:55.341 --> 01:58:56.971
Sadly?

01:58:56.972 --> 01:58:58.603
He took his own life.

01:58:58.604 --> 01:59:04.204
It was greed that drove him,
so how would he have remained sane?

01:59:05.324 --> 01:59:07.594
Losing all that fortune

01:59:07.595 --> 01:59:10.710
which must have been worse
than any other punishment.

01:59:15.167 --> 01:59:17.791
His Majesty has acknowledged
you as his subject.

01:59:17.792 --> 01:59:19.753
Must you leave for Japan?

01:59:20.585 --> 01:59:23.582
I wish to go out into the world.

01:59:24.277 --> 01:59:26.907
Come back to Joseon whenever you wish.

01:59:26.908 --> 01:59:28.816
- When you come back, I...
- Wherever I am...

01:59:28.817 --> 01:59:31.814
I will live the rest of my days
as a subject of Joseon.

01:59:33.636 --> 01:59:34.880
- Don't.
- It's just...

01:59:34.881 --> 01:59:35.978
I won't hear of it.

01:59:35.979 --> 01:59:37.108
- She's just not into you.
- Shut up!

01:59:37.109 --> 01:59:38.164
She's not!

01:59:41.641 --> 01:59:45.759
I thought about what you called a dream.

01:59:50.943 --> 01:59:53.512
So, what is it that you want to be?

01:59:54.751 --> 01:59:56.702
I want to become a flower.

01:59:56.703 --> 01:59:58.471
A flower?

01:59:58.472 --> 02:00:00.563
Why a flower?

02:00:00.564 --> 02:00:05.117
Don't flowers get treated like royalty
wherever they go?

02:00:05.118 --> 02:00:08.987
They don't get pulled out like weeds

02:00:08.988 --> 02:00:12.124
or get stepped on like grass.

02:00:12.125 --> 02:00:15.335
And they're adored by everyone.

02:00:18.694 --> 02:00:24.487
Even if you aren't a flower,
people are precious just the way they are.

02:00:47.814 --> 02:00:52.622
[Paju, Gyeonggi Province. Not long after]

02:00:52.623 --> 02:00:55.237
What a loss of a beauty.

02:00:55.238 --> 02:00:58.938
Doesn't it look like she was
stabbed with a sharp object?

02:00:58.939 --> 02:01:02.725
Judging from the depth of these marks,
I don't think it was an object.

02:01:03.555 --> 02:01:05.911
Two identical punctures.

02:01:05.912 --> 02:01:08.130
An equal distance
between the marks.

02:01:08.131 --> 02:01:10.060
That suggests...

02:01:10.061 --> 02:01:11.737
Suggests?

02:01:15.565 --> 02:01:16.866
That hurts!

02:01:16.867 --> 02:01:18.285
Have you lost your mind?

02:01:18.286 --> 02:01:20.194
As expected, canine teeth.

02:01:20.833 --> 02:01:22.294
Was it a beast then?

02:01:22.295 --> 02:01:24.170
Not a beast, but a man.

02:01:24.171 --> 02:01:28.502
Can't be. How can a man
create these puncture wounds?

02:01:44.917 --> 02:01:46.453
Move!
