02:09.054 --> 02:11.388
Where are we again?
Hmm?

02:11.390 --> 02:13.723
Oh, what...
What's going on?

02:13.725 --> 02:15.491
We're Disembarking.

02:15.493 --> 02:16.792
Yes, I know.
You told me that,

02:16.794 --> 02:19.127
but... but to
another plane, right?

02:19.129 --> 02:20.561
We don't know yet.

02:20.563 --> 02:22.396
So, you woke me up,
and now we're...

02:22.398 --> 02:24.598
We're waiting here...
Where are we again?

02:24.600 --> 02:25.732
Albuquerque.

02:25.734 --> 02:27.300
Oh, shit.

02:27.302 --> 02:29.168
I thought
I was dreaming.

02:29.170 --> 02:31.436
Well, the big fella's up, is he?
Very good.

02:31.438 --> 02:33.104
Yeah. He nodded off
for a minute,

02:33.106 --> 02:34.572
so he's still
a bit groggy, I'm afraid.

02:34.574 --> 02:37.408
Very good.
Yeah, but what's up?

02:37.410 --> 02:39.410
Oh, no, don't worry.
I'll explain. It's fine.

02:39.412 --> 02:41.311
Ah. Very good.

02:44.148 --> 02:45.615
He's good
at his job, isn't he?

02:45.617 --> 02:47.516
Yeah. Very good,
as he might say.

02:47.518 --> 02:49.251
Now, look,
I'm not fine,

02:49.253 --> 02:51.586
so why did you say "we're fine"
when I'm not that at all?

02:51.588 --> 02:54.488
I was about to explain to you...
We're grounded here for now.

02:54.490 --> 02:56.156
But... what... why?

02:56.158 --> 02:58.358
Because Dallas
had torrential rain,

02:58.360 --> 03:01.561
so this is
as far as we go.

03:06.633 --> 03:10.502
So, wait, we just
stopped in Albuquerque?

03:10.504 --> 03:13.471
Why don't we just turn around
and go back to L.A.?

03:13.473 --> 03:14.839
I don't know.
That's what they decided.

03:14.841 --> 03:16.607
Who decided that?

03:16.609 --> 03:18.542
Did all the passengers
get together and take a vote?

03:18.544 --> 03:21.311
'Cause I'm not very happy.

03:24.682 --> 03:27.517
Well, here are.

03:29.287 --> 03:32.121
Great.
Well, this is just great.

03:32.123 --> 03:35.190
Don't worry,
I e-mailed ahead.

03:35.192 --> 03:37.325
We still might get
the last flight out.

03:37.327 --> 03:39.126
Otherwise,
there's the bus.

03:39.128 --> 03:40.627
Oh, don't say that.
What?

03:40.629 --> 03:42.462
The bus.
Why?

03:42.464 --> 03:45.698
I hate bus travel.
It scares me.

03:45.700 --> 03:47.366
All right, Les.

03:47.368 --> 03:49.835
Well, we can always
rent a little subcompact

03:49.837 --> 03:53.171
with no leg room and the stink
of old cigarette smoke,

03:53.173 --> 03:56.240
and I can drive it
through the night.

03:56.242 --> 03:57.574
Is that better?

03:57.576 --> 04:00.877
All right.
Greyhound it is.

04:00.879 --> 04:04.213
Man,
I don't believe this.

04:04.215 --> 04:06.682
We don't have to
take the greyhound.

04:06.684 --> 04:09.518
I called and booked us rooms
into the airport hotel

04:09.520 --> 04:11.353
so we can relax properly

04:11.355 --> 04:13.321
and also so we don't
have to wait here at the gate,

04:13.323 --> 04:15.156
'cause I know...

04:15.158 --> 04:16.589
You don't
feel well, you know?

04:16.591 --> 04:18.825
So, we'll be all right.

04:18.827 --> 04:20.259
Seriously.

04:20.261 --> 04:22.327
Says you.

04:22.329 --> 04:23.528
Yeah.

04:23.530 --> 04:24.862
We will, though.
I promise.

04:24.864 --> 04:26.830
Mnh.
That doesn't count.

04:26.832 --> 04:29.833
You English
are perpetually optimistic,

04:29.835 --> 04:32.702
even in places
like Waterloo.

04:32.704 --> 04:34.670
We won at Waterloo.

04:34.672 --> 04:36.338
You know what I mean.

04:36.340 --> 04:38.673
India, then,
places like that.

04:38.675 --> 04:40.241
Africa.

04:40.243 --> 04:41.542
It's all fun and games

04:41.544 --> 04:44.912
till somebody
sticks a spear in your ass.

04:49.884 --> 04:52.251
So, where you guys from?

04:53.686 --> 04:55.353
Korea.

05:00.692 --> 05:03.760
Los Angeles.

05:07.730 --> 05:11.465
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

05:11.467 --> 05:13.433
Okay.

05:13.435 --> 05:15.668
Okay.

05:18.304 --> 05:21.905
Oh. Oh.
Oh, thanks very much.

05:21.907 --> 05:23.773
No...

05:23.775 --> 05:25.808
Thank you.
Right, sorry.

05:25.810 --> 05:29.611
Okay.
Thanks again. Bye.

05:29.613 --> 05:31.813
So...
Geez, Nat.

05:31.815 --> 05:33.414
Why don't you
toss in a blow job

05:33.416 --> 05:35.416
for all the trouble
you're putting them through?

05:35.418 --> 05:37.484
It's their job
to help <i> you.</i>

05:37.486 --> 05:39.252
You know, it's funny

05:39.254 --> 05:40.553
because with anybody else,

05:40.555 --> 05:42.321
that would be considered
sexual harassment.

05:42.323 --> 05:43.789
Yeah, but that's why
I like you...

05:43.791 --> 05:45.457
You're not like
everyone else.

05:45.459 --> 05:47.225
You're regular, normal.

05:47.227 --> 05:48.559
I was just trying
to be nice.

05:48.561 --> 05:49.893
It's their fault.

05:49.895 --> 05:52.662
You don't have to be, like,
completely submissive.

05:52.664 --> 05:55.231
What? Don't say that.
Well...

05:55.233 --> 05:56.665
Just because you
want something from someone,

05:56.667 --> 05:58.433
it doesn't mean
you have to be nasty about it.

05:58.435 --> 06:00.234
And it's not their fault,
actually. It's the weather.

06:00.236 --> 06:01.401
Mm, I suppose.

06:03.237 --> 06:05.504
So?
Well, no flights for now,

06:05.506 --> 06:07.672
not to Dallas, anyway.

06:07.674 --> 06:10.474
Oh, boy.
Boy, this is...

06:10.476 --> 06:12.442
Not good.
Exactly.

06:12.444 --> 06:13.810
My thoughts exactly.

06:13.812 --> 06:15.311
We could always drive,

06:15.313 --> 06:17.279
but I'm not sure
we'd make it on time.

06:17.281 --> 06:19.281
Plus, we'd be
totally exhausted.

06:19.283 --> 06:20.915
Well,<i> I</i> would be, anyway.

06:20.917 --> 06:23.684
Mm, sorry.
Busted wing.

06:24.653 --> 06:26.285
Come on,
let's think.

06:26.287 --> 06:28.687
We're... we're two adults here,
college-educated.

06:28.689 --> 06:30.422
Wh-Wh-where
did you study again?

06:30.424 --> 06:31.689
Cambridge.

06:31.691 --> 06:34.625
My safety school.

06:34.627 --> 06:37.361
Uh, so, come on.
L-Let's figure this out.

06:37.363 --> 06:38.595
I tried
all the other airlines.

06:38.597 --> 06:39.762
They all have
the same problem.

06:39.764 --> 06:41.530
And nobody's
flying out later tonight?

06:41.532 --> 06:43.532
Yes. We're on hold
with four other carriers.

06:43.534 --> 06:44.966
We could always
take the bus.

06:44.968 --> 06:46.600
Do you want to do that?
No, no.

06:46.602 --> 06:48.602
So...
So, you got it covered.

06:48.604 --> 06:50.337
That's good.
That's good.

06:51.806 --> 06:54.507
Well, looks like we might
be stuck here for a while.

06:55.775 --> 06:58.610
Want to change or something,
get out of that sweater?

06:58.612 --> 07:00.878
Why? Well, nothing,
I just noticed

07:00.880 --> 07:04.781
you were sweating a bit,
you know, perspiring.

07:04.783 --> 07:06.015
It's hot in here.

07:06.017 --> 07:07.383
I'm fine.

07:07.385 --> 07:10.319
I wasn't being forward.
Trust me.

07:10.321 --> 07:12.821
I said I'm fine.
I just meant,

07:12.823 --> 07:15.523
you're wearing a Turtleneck
and we're in New Mexico.

07:15.525 --> 07:17.625
Polo neck.
What?

07:17.627 --> 07:19.727
That's what we
call it in England...

07:19.729 --> 07:20.794
Polo neck.

07:20.796 --> 07:22.028
Oh.

07:22.030 --> 07:23.796
You're always
doing that.

07:23.798 --> 07:26.298
What, correct you?

07:26.300 --> 07:29.367
No, no, the... the turtle...
The Polo-neck thing.

07:29.369 --> 07:30.801
You like those, huh?

07:30.803 --> 07:33.570
Yeah.
It's my style.

07:33.572 --> 07:36.339
Well, good.

07:36.341 --> 07:41.043
Good. This was fun,
getting to know each other.

07:47.550 --> 07:48.917
Let's get a bite.

07:48.919 --> 07:50.685
I always think better
with food,

07:50.687 --> 07:53.487
even hotel food.

08:08.868 --> 08:11.669
Oh. No, no.
See, now you ruined it.

08:11.671 --> 08:13.771
I said no potatoes, none.

08:13.773 --> 08:16.507
So, if you put them on there,
that's not none.

08:16.509 --> 08:18.509
Sorry, what,
you want more?

08:18.511 --> 08:20.077
No, not more.

08:20.079 --> 08:21.945
Jesus,
I don't want potatoes.

08:21.947 --> 08:25.014
Why would I want more?
So...

08:25.016 --> 08:28.256
Wait, you want more potatoes or not?
It's all right. This is good. Thank you.

08:45.534 --> 08:49.036
I thought you
didn't like potatoes.

08:49.038 --> 08:50.871
At the breakfast meetings
we've shared,

08:50.873 --> 08:52.639
you always
send them back.

08:52.641 --> 08:55.375
I'm a complex guy.

08:55.377 --> 08:57.110
And, my,
aren't we observant?

08:57.112 --> 09:00.113
What are you,
stalking me?

09:00.115 --> 09:03.783
You should be so lucky.

09:11.491 --> 09:14.059
Honey, have you heard of
"word in edgewise"?

09:14.061 --> 09:15.794
It's a saying.

09:15.796 --> 09:18.429
It's a... yes, people
use it all the time.

09:18.431 --> 09:20.898
Mm-hmm, yes, it means
"Take a deep breath

09:20.900 --> 09:22.766
and let me
speak for a second."

09:22.768 --> 09:25.435
All right.
Yes, now, listen.

09:25.437 --> 09:27.403
Now, listen,
I'm not in Dallas.

09:27.405 --> 09:29.004
No.

09:29.006 --> 09:30.972
No, no,
nothing's wrong.

09:30.974 --> 09:32.073
No, it's not.

09:32.075 --> 09:34.442
No. No!

09:34.444 --> 09:38.812
No, no, it... no, Dallas...
No, Dallas is having storms.

09:38.814 --> 09:40.680
Yes, so I'm stuck
in Albuquerque,

09:40.682 --> 09:42.782
and I wanted to call.

09:42.784 --> 09:44.450
What?

09:44.452 --> 09:48.519
Oh, no, th-this is
my... my coworker's phone.

09:48.521 --> 09:50.521
Yes, Miss Havington.

09:50.523 --> 09:53.056
Yeah, that's right.
Yes, Natalie.

09:53.058 --> 09:55.758
Yes, the British one.

09:55.760 --> 09:58.193
Yeah, her phone worked here...
AT&T or something...

09:58.195 --> 09:59.894
So I borrowed it.

09:59.896 --> 10:01.795
Hmm?

10:01.797 --> 10:03.763
Oh, yes,
I'll thank her.

10:03.765 --> 10:05.698
Yeah. Now, listen.

10:05.700 --> 10:07.733
Honey...

10:07.735 --> 10:09.201
Honey, look...

10:09.203 --> 10:12.537
Honey. Honey.

10:12.539 --> 10:14.338
Honey.

10:19.110 --> 10:21.977
Suzie?
Yes.

10:21.979 --> 10:24.646
Yeah, no, it's just the hotel
phone 'causeLes is upst... he...

10:24.648 --> 10:27.081
Yeah, his...
Anyway, the th... yes, we're...

10:27.083 --> 10:28.749
Yeah, we're in
a spot of bother.

10:28.751 --> 10:32.919
Um... we're s-
we're stuck.

10:32.921 --> 10:35.554
Um, Albuquerque.

10:35.556 --> 10:37.055
Yeah. I know.

10:38.725 --> 10:40.224
The weather. No, it's just
the weather, really.

10:40.226 --> 10:43.894
Um, and, um, anyway,
so, we could...

10:43.896 --> 10:45.228
We could use
a little bit of your...

10:45.230 --> 10:47.063
Of your help
on it, really.

10:47.065 --> 10:49.231
Um, I know, I know.

10:49.233 --> 10:51.233
Domestic travel
in the United States.

10:51.235 --> 10:53.568
Okay.

10:53.570 --> 10:55.670
All right, so...

10:55.672 --> 10:57.171
Oh, really?
All right, then.

10:57.173 --> 10:59.573
Well, if you... if you...
If you call my other phone,

10:59.575 --> 11:01.575
I'll have it in a minute.

11:01.577 --> 11:04.177
Oh, you wo...
Okay, e-mail. Okay.

11:04.179 --> 11:05.745
Well, I-I
look forward to it.

11:05.747 --> 11:07.012
All right.

11:07.014 --> 11:09.114
Les is fine, yeah.
He's doing okay.

11:09.116 --> 11:12.784
Les...

11:12.786 --> 11:14.585
All right, then.
Okay, then, Suzie.

11:14.587 --> 11:17.187
Thank you.
Bye.

11:17.189 --> 11:19.789
This may be
the first time

11:19.791 --> 11:22.591
I've ever had a Martini
before noon.

11:22.593 --> 11:25.926
Well, make that 10:30.

11:25.928 --> 11:27.928
Shit.

11:27.930 --> 11:30.797
This is crazy.
We got to get out of here.

11:30.799 --> 11:33.199
Mm.
I mean, we're...

11:33.201 --> 11:35.267
We need
to be there, right?

11:35.269 --> 11:37.602
We should
be there already.

11:37.604 --> 11:38.936
Yeah.

11:38.938 --> 11:41.104
I told them,
"This is a big deal.

11:41.106 --> 11:44.273
Let us travel out on Sunday,
get a jump on things."

11:44.275 --> 11:47.943
But, no, they save 400 bucks
by having us fly on Monday.

11:47.945 --> 11:50.111
Well... well,
I hope they're happy

11:50.113 --> 11:53.180
when we end up walking in late
tomorrow morning.

11:57.051 --> 11:59.886
Are you all right?
Yeah, yeah, it's just...

11:59.888 --> 12:01.787
It's just,
this is a big account,

12:01.789 --> 12:03.955
and it's
a huge deal for me.

12:03.957 --> 12:07.058
For all of us...
But especially for me.

12:07.060 --> 12:09.360
I know it is.
Yeah.

12:09.362 --> 12:13.296
I feel like there's a lot
riding on this.

12:13.298 --> 12:15.731
You know, I...

12:15.733 --> 12:18.333
Yeah, I...
I think I'm gonna...

12:18.335 --> 12:21.069
I'm gonna run into town
for a... for a little bit.

12:21.071 --> 12:22.970
Sorry?
Into town.

12:22.972 --> 12:27.139
I-I feel like being in the city
for a few hours, so...

12:27.141 --> 12:28.907
What, like now?
R-Right now?

12:28.909 --> 12:31.910
Yeah, just for a bit,
if that's okay.

12:31.912 --> 12:33.811
Blow off some steam.

12:33.813 --> 12:35.212
Of course.

12:35.214 --> 12:37.914
'Cause we're not getting out
of here. That's obvious.

12:37.916 --> 12:40.983
I mean, we're not.
Well, we could, though.
You don't know that.

12:40.985 --> 12:42.985
No, it's gonna
take a while.

12:42.987 --> 12:45.921
I'm just gonna...
Just gonna get in the shuttle,

12:45.923 --> 12:49.157
go back to the airport,
grab a cab, do a few things,

12:49.159 --> 12:53.027
and I'll... I'll be back
in like a-a couple hours.

12:53.029 --> 12:56.397
Les, do you think it's wise
for us to split up?

12:56.399 --> 12:59.032
Hey, we're not
married here or anything.

12:59.034 --> 13:02.001
W-we're more like...
Like bandits, you know,

13:02.003 --> 13:05.771
Desperados, Butch & Sundance,
that kind of deal.

13:05.773 --> 13:07.405
We can be apart
for a little bit.

13:07.407 --> 13:09.206
But...

13:09.208 --> 13:10.373
You'll be fine.

13:10.375 --> 13:12.108
You just keep
checking on things,

13:12.110 --> 13:15.477
and I'll give you a buzz
in an hour or two, all right?

13:18.047 --> 13:20.181
I don't like this.
I just want to say that.

13:20.183 --> 13:22.016
Nat. Nat, come on,

13:22.018 --> 13:24.752
I just want to pick up a thing
or two, for my kids...

13:24.754 --> 13:26.019
Indian knickknacks,

13:26.021 --> 13:28.688
a headdress, okay?

13:28.690 --> 13:30.356
But there... there are stores
right over there in the terminal,

13:30.358 --> 13:32.291
and they have
all kinds of...

13:32.293 --> 13:33.792
You know, I don't want
to jeopardize our...

13:33.794 --> 13:35.693
Jesus, Natalie,
do you mind?

13:35.695 --> 13:36.860
...plans.

13:36.862 --> 13:38.194
I mean, we're here,
all right?

13:38.196 --> 13:40.029
Not my fault,
but we're stuck,

13:40.031 --> 13:41.730
and now I would like
to spend

13:41.732 --> 13:44.065
a... a minute of,
you know, personal time.

13:44.067 --> 13:46.767
So, just... just give me
a break, all right?

13:46.769 --> 13:48.268
God.

13:48.270 --> 13:50.203
Fine.

13:51.940 --> 13:54.206
Sorry.

13:54.208 --> 13:56.241
That was out of line.

13:56.243 --> 13:58.810
Forgive me.

13:58.812 --> 13:59.944
Yes, it was.

13:59.946 --> 14:03.213
I'm sorry. I'm...

14:03.215 --> 14:06.382
I'll check in every half-hour.
How's that? I...

14:06.384 --> 14:08.751
I'll give you a ring,
and if something opens up,

14:08.753 --> 14:10.719
I can be back here
in like 30 minutes.

14:10.721 --> 14:12.954
I'll even leave my bag
at the desk.

14:12.956 --> 14:14.422
Do what you want.

14:14.424 --> 14:17.091
Aw, don't be
that way. I...

14:17.093 --> 14:19.726
I said I was sorry, didn't I?
I said that.

14:19.728 --> 14:22.929
Yes, you did. Yes.
I just want to run an errand.

14:22.931 --> 14:24.830
It's no big deal.

14:24.832 --> 14:26.164
I'll be back in a few,
and we can...

14:26.166 --> 14:28.065
We can figure out
what's what.

14:28.067 --> 14:30.333
Great.
Good idea.

14:30.335 --> 14:32.101
Go for it.
You're angry.

14:32.103 --> 14:33.402
No.

14:33.404 --> 14:35.404
Well, you're
a little angry.

14:35.406 --> 14:37.172
I've worked with you
long enough

14:37.174 --> 14:39.274
to detect
your tones for stuff,

14:39.276 --> 14:43.777
certain tones for...
For happy or tired, pissy.

14:43.779 --> 14:45.912
I don't get...
I don't get pissy.
I can tell.

14:45.914 --> 14:47.179
All right, fine.

14:47.181 --> 14:48.747
If you're mad about this,
then let's...

14:48.749 --> 14:49.748
No.

14:49.750 --> 14:50.915
I'm not mad.

14:50.917 --> 14:53.417
We're not married,
remember?

14:53.419 --> 14:55.919
Yeah, okay.
We're Butch & Sundance,

14:55.921 --> 14:57.754
although I don't recall
them ever splitting up.

14:57.756 --> 14:59.255
I've only ever seen
the movie once,

14:59.257 --> 15:02.424
but I believe that's the
whole point of the Ampersand,

15:02.426 --> 15:04.192
as I understand it.

15:04.194 --> 15:05.826
Fine. Whatever that means.

15:05.828 --> 15:09.362
It means they earned their name
by sticking together.

15:09.364 --> 15:11.997
The Ampersand
is used exclusively

15:11.999 --> 15:14.099
for things
that belong together,

15:14.101 --> 15:16.000
not separated.

15:16.002 --> 15:17.768
Gee, you weren't...

15:17.770 --> 15:19.202
You weren't kidding about
that Cambridge stuff, huh?

15:19.204 --> 15:22.138
No, I just think
this is stupid. That's all.

15:22.140 --> 15:23.806
Okay. Good.
Well...

15:23.808 --> 15:25.808
I'll make sure I put it
in my captain's log.

15:25.810 --> 15:27.376
You see, that's
the problem right there,

15:27.378 --> 15:29.277
is that you just assume
that you're in charge.

15:29.279 --> 15:30.978
You just assume
that you're butch.

15:30.980 --> 15:33.947
But you're not butch.
You're Sundance.

15:33.949 --> 15:35.848
You know what?

15:35.850 --> 15:38.050
No, no, I'm not gonna
get into this kind of thing.

15:38.052 --> 15:40.152
I'm not gonna get
into a pissing contest

15:40.154 --> 15:42.053
with a work colleague
about...

15:42.055 --> 15:43.954
I'll see you...

15:43.956 --> 15:45.488
Butch.

15:45.490 --> 15:48.057
Okay, but
I'm not waiting.

15:48.059 --> 15:51.226
So, if something opens up, I'll
be on that flight. So there.

15:51.228 --> 15:52.961
I said I'd call
every half...

15:52.963 --> 15:55.229
You can call.
I'm not waiting.

15:55.231 --> 15:56.463
I'll see you in Dallas.

16:43.575 --> 16:46.243
Where you headed to now?

16:46.245 --> 16:48.144
India?

17:17.107 --> 17:21.542
Oh. Hey.
Hello.

17:21.545 --> 17:23.578
What happened to your sling?

17:23.579 --> 17:25.146
Oh. Well, I'm suppo...

17:25.147 --> 17:27.481
The doctor told me
I'm just supposed to...

17:27.483 --> 17:30.150
I'm just giving it
a little air.

17:30.152 --> 17:32.218
So, what's up?

17:32.220 --> 17:34.386
I'm coming with you,
I suppose.

17:34.388 --> 17:37.255
What? Well, wait,
but we said...

17:37.257 --> 17:38.589
Well, I'm not
splitting us up.

17:38.591 --> 17:40.424
We're a team
and we came here together,

17:40.426 --> 17:42.360
so I'm not
leaving you alone.

17:42.362 --> 17:45.496
Well, I was the one who left.
I-I did the actual leaving.

17:45.498 --> 17:47.231
I know, but you know
what I mean.

17:47.233 --> 17:49.566
Yeah, but, uh...

17:49.568 --> 17:52.268
No "buts."

17:52.270 --> 17:54.236
I can't do this presentation
without you,

17:54.238 --> 17:56.004
and if we mess this up,

17:56.006 --> 17:58.206
there are no bonuses,
no promotions, nothing.

17:58.208 --> 18:00.208
So, if you
go into town, then...

18:01.444 --> 18:04.511
...I... I go
into town, too.

18:14.455 --> 18:17.022
- I still don't get it.
- What?

18:17.024 --> 18:18.189
Why you're following me.

18:18.191 --> 18:19.723
I'm not following you.
I just...

18:19.725 --> 18:21.391
Sorry. What was
that address again?

18:21.393 --> 18:23.192
Oh, no...
Gold Avenue?

18:23.194 --> 18:24.593
No, no, no,
just, uh,

18:24.595 --> 18:28.029
down around the center of town,
just around there.

18:28.031 --> 18:29.563
It's a big area, pal.

18:29.565 --> 18:33.099
Fine. Then choose a place,
a convenient place,

18:33.101 --> 18:35.367
and, uh,
that'll be fine.

18:37.070 --> 18:38.636
There's lots of areas
I can take you to.

18:38.638 --> 18:40.704
You don't happen to have
an actual address, have you?

18:40.706 --> 18:43.473
Nope. Just looking
to get into Albuquerque.

18:43.475 --> 18:44.574
Is that okay?

18:44.576 --> 18:46.409
Y... it's your money.

18:46.411 --> 18:47.710
That is true.

18:47.712 --> 18:50.312
So, let's just
head into town, all right?

18:50.314 --> 18:53.114
All right.
As you like it.

18:54.282 --> 18:55.548
That's from Shakespeare.

18:55.550 --> 18:57.416
Yeah. Yeah, thanks.

18:57.418 --> 18:59.117
Good one. Got it.

18:59.119 --> 19:01.152
You, uh... you people
have Shakespeare, don't you?

19:01.154 --> 19:02.620
Yeah.
The English.

19:02.622 --> 19:05.389
He's Da shit,
as you people say.

19:05.391 --> 19:07.124
Da shit.

19:07.126 --> 19:09.059
I just, uh, started
getting into Shakespeare myself

19:09.061 --> 19:11.594
through, um,
graphic novels.

19:11.596 --> 19:14.496
Just about to tuck into this
"Henry," uh, "'Vee'."

19:14.498 --> 19:16.397
I'm not following you.

19:16.399 --> 19:18.499
I'm doing this
because I care about our work.

19:18.501 --> 19:21.401
Believe me, I don't love
going into Albuquerque,

19:21.403 --> 19:23.503
and I get
really carsick, so...

19:23.505 --> 19:26.739
All right. All right.
Understood. Jesus.

19:26.741 --> 19:29.675
If you want me to pull over,
sweetheart, just say the word. I'll...

19:29.677 --> 19:32.244
It's kind of a... a private
conversation back here.

19:32.246 --> 19:33.478
Sorry.

19:33.480 --> 19:35.413
I-I'm all right
for now. Thank you.

19:35.415 --> 19:37.114
I'll let you know
if it changes, though.

19:37.116 --> 19:39.249
Got it.

19:39.251 --> 19:42.418
I'm fine
for now, though.

19:42.420 --> 19:44.820
Okay, but...

19:44.822 --> 19:46.588
It's okay. I...

19:46.590 --> 19:49.257
I like that you're
the loyal type.

19:49.259 --> 19:51.659
It's nice.

20:00.835 --> 20:04.304
And, uh, this is enough
to keep you, correct?

20:04.306 --> 20:07.173
Uh
Whatever you say, bud.

20:07.175 --> 20:09.175
So, you'll be here
when we come back?

20:09.177 --> 20:12.378
You're the man with the cash.
You make the rules.

20:12.380 --> 20:14.146
That's fine by me.
Okay, good.

20:14.148 --> 20:16.348
Well, uh, then just
wait right here,

20:16.350 --> 20:18.817
and, uh, we'll be back
in about an hour, all right?

20:18.819 --> 20:21.119
Okay, buddy.

20:21.121 --> 20:23.621
You want to synchronize
our watches?

20:23.623 --> 20:26.624
Oh, yeah.
Yeah. Let's.

20:26.626 --> 20:28.392
You know,
um, uh,

20:28.394 --> 20:31.294
you... you can just wait
in the car if you want to

20:31.296 --> 20:32.495
'cause I'm fine.

20:32.497 --> 20:33.662
No chance.

20:33.664 --> 20:35.363
Yeah, I'm just
going to, uh...

20:35.365 --> 20:37.865
I know.
Indian trinkets.

20:37.867 --> 20:39.333
Yeah, whatever
I can find.

20:39.335 --> 20:40.867
I'm just gonna
have a walk around

20:40.869 --> 20:43.736
and... and look for some,
uh, you know, knickknacks.

20:43.738 --> 20:44.803
I thought
you had an errand.

20:44.805 --> 20:46.638
I do. I do.

20:46.640 --> 20:50.341
To look around and find
some touristy shit for my kids.

20:50.343 --> 20:52.710
But your kids
are still in high school.

20:52.712 --> 20:54.678
So, you still
buy them presents?

20:54.680 --> 20:57.380
Yeah, I do.

20:57.382 --> 21:00.716
Okay. Go on, then.

21:38.788 --> 21:42.690
Did I not just say "right
back here," as in over there?

21:42.692 --> 21:44.692
Yeah, you did.

21:44.694 --> 21:46.460
Well, then why the hell
are you following me?

21:46.462 --> 21:49.763
Well, um...
Did you want me...

21:49.765 --> 21:51.564
To wait
at that exact spot?

21:51.566 --> 21:53.899
That'd be the general idea
of "right back here."

21:53.901 --> 21:55.400
Not always.

21:55.402 --> 21:56.901
But I can see
how you might infer that.

21:56.903 --> 21:58.636
I'm sorry,
what? "Infer"?

21:58.638 --> 22:00.404
Because I thought I'd take
matters into my own hands

22:00.406 --> 22:02.439
and I'd
bring up the rear,

22:02.441 --> 22:04.374
uh, at a respectful distance,
of course.

22:04.376 --> 22:05.708
Well... well,
don't. Don't.

22:05.710 --> 22:07.943
Just... just wait for me,
please, like I asked.

22:07.945 --> 22:10.645
You really
only did imply it.

22:10.647 --> 22:13.614
L-Look, can you just...
All right?

22:14.549 --> 22:16.216
All's well
that ends well.

22:16.218 --> 22:19.819
Guess who said that.

22:19.821 --> 22:21.287
Shakespeare.

22:22.889 --> 22:26.224
I, uh...
I need pills.

22:26.226 --> 22:30.594
I'll be right here.

22:30.596 --> 22:32.862
If you're coming, come.

22:37.902 --> 22:39.668
Hi, there.
Hello.

22:39.670 --> 22:42.237
Uh, you carry pills?
Ibuprofen?

22:42.239 --> 22:43.972
Mm-hmm. The rear.

22:43.974 --> 22:45.473
Excuse me?

22:46.908 --> 22:48.975
In the rear.

22:48.977 --> 22:52.344
I'm sorry, I have no idea
what you just said right now.

22:53.913 --> 22:57.582
Yeah. All right, I know
where the rear would be,

22:57.584 --> 22:59.317
but are we on
the same page here?

22:59.319 --> 23:01.452
You have medicine?

23:01.454 --> 23:02.653
Of course.

23:02.655 --> 23:04.521
Back there.

23:04.523 --> 23:05.455
Medicine, Aisle two!

23:05.457 --> 23:08.324
Uh...

23:08.326 --> 23:10.592
I'm just pulling your leg.
We love to say that in this business...

23:10.594 --> 23:12.260
"Cleanup on aisle two"
and that shit.

23:12.262 --> 23:13.828
Ah, I'll bet you do.

23:13.830 --> 23:16.330
Of course, it always helps
to have an Aisle two,

23:16.332 --> 23:18.799
but I guess that's
beside the point.

23:18.801 --> 23:21.434
I need Advil.
Do you have any?

23:22.769 --> 23:26.972
Back in the rear.
Right, the rear. Okay.

23:30.342 --> 23:32.276
Excuse me.

23:32.278 --> 23:35.745
Uh, uh, can I have
the, uh, Ibuprofen, please?

23:38.348 --> 23:40.282
Yep.

23:40.284 --> 23:42.017
Thank you.

23:59.366 --> 24:00.966
Keep it.
Excuse me?

24:00.968 --> 24:02.701
Uh, it's a tip.
Don't worry about it.

24:02.703 --> 24:04.502
Sorry, but it's
not enough.

24:04.504 --> 24:07.471
Oh. Oh, sorry.

24:07.473 --> 24:09.039
Whoops.

24:11.509 --> 24:13.676
Now keep it.

24:13.678 --> 24:14.977
Cool. Thanks.

24:14.979 --> 24:16.478
Keep in touch.

24:16.480 --> 24:17.812
Thanks, buddy.

24:17.814 --> 24:19.914
Thank you.

24:19.916 --> 24:21.815
Okay.

24:21.817 --> 24:24.450
I will do.
Thank you very much.

24:29.354 --> 24:30.721
Thank you.

24:30.723 --> 24:31.988
Nothing yet.

24:31.990 --> 24:33.923
Dallas is still
under the weather.

24:33.925 --> 24:35.591
Perfect.

24:37.860 --> 24:39.594
Don't take
too many of those.

24:39.596 --> 24:41.128
Okay.

25:08.722 --> 25:10.522
I suppose dildos
could be considered trinkets.

25:10.524 --> 25:11.890
Is that the idea?

25:11.892 --> 25:13.458
Yeah, funny.

25:13.460 --> 25:16.527
Ha, ha, ha.

25:16.529 --> 25:19.029
You seem
pretty interested there.

25:19.031 --> 25:20.597
No, no,
I'm just...

25:20.599 --> 25:22.031
Just taking a rest.
That's all.

25:22.033 --> 25:24.400
Right.
I am.

25:24.402 --> 25:26.635
Hard to believe
they can put stuff like this

25:26.637 --> 25:28.470
out here where anybody
could just...

25:28.472 --> 25:30.605
You know,
children and all that.

25:30.607 --> 25:32.373
Of course.

25:32.375 --> 25:34.875
It's embarrassing, if you
want to know the truth.

25:34.877 --> 25:37.911
I'm embarrassed for the people
who run this place.

25:37.913 --> 25:39.712
Why are you embarrassed?

25:39.714 --> 25:41.980
Well, it's what they
got to do to make a living...

25:41.982 --> 25:45.483
Sell shit like this,
sick shit.

25:45.485 --> 25:49.920
I mean, it's just plastic and
metal... that's all... rubber.

25:49.922 --> 25:51.821
It's only sick
if you let it be.

25:51.823 --> 25:54.423
Oh, you have the
Marquis De Sade scholarship

25:54.425 --> 25:55.991
back there at Cambridge?

25:55.993 --> 25:57.559
Very good, Les.

25:57.561 --> 25:58.960
Anyway,
I-I wasn't looking.

25:58.962 --> 26:00.962
I'm just... you know,
I'm taking a pause.

26:00.964 --> 26:03.097
That's all.

26:03.099 --> 26:06.500
I won't tell any of your little
friends back at the office

26:06.502 --> 26:07.934
if that's what you're
worrying about.

26:07.936 --> 26:10.670
I'm not worried about it
because I didn't do anything.

26:10.672 --> 26:12.505
Whatever you say.

26:12.507 --> 26:14.573
That's right.
So?

26:14.575 --> 26:16.074
So, you can go inside
if you want to.

26:16.076 --> 26:18.509
I don't want to.
How could you even think that?

26:18.511 --> 26:20.911
I'm...
I'm stretching, all right?

26:20.913 --> 26:24.715
I'm... I'm just taking a little
moment here at this sex shop.

26:24.717 --> 26:26.516
That's all.

26:26.518 --> 26:29.218
Okay.
I'm sorry I misread you.

26:29.220 --> 26:31.086
All right.

26:42.262 --> 26:47.665
Well, do you want to get a
coffee or something? Yes, I do. Yeah.

26:48.800 --> 26:51.801
Thank you.
Yep.

26:53.737 --> 26:55.704
Hello.

26:55.706 --> 26:57.272
Morning.
Good morning.

26:57.274 --> 26:59.641
Just what part of the morning
looks good to you, huh?

26:59.643 --> 27:02.110
It's a
professional courtesy, is all.

27:02.112 --> 27:02.944
Got it.

27:02.946 --> 27:04.612
Coffee?

27:04.614 --> 27:05.879
Or something
a bit warmer?

27:05.881 --> 27:07.213
Oh, just the coffee for me.

27:07.215 --> 27:08.881
Thanks much.
Very good.

27:08.883 --> 27:10.949
How about you, sir?
Mm, coffee's fine,

27:10.951 --> 27:13.051
maybe with just
a hint of warmth.

27:13.053 --> 27:15.553
Very good. And, uh,
make it the nice stuff.

27:15.555 --> 27:16.887
I'm paying
with yankee dollars.

27:16.889 --> 27:19.222
Very good, sir.
Very good?

27:19.224 --> 27:23.125
Hey, say... say, your son doesn't happen
to work as a flight attendant, does he?

27:23.127 --> 27:24.626
No, sir, afraid not.

27:24.628 --> 27:26.060
He's gay.

27:26.062 --> 27:27.561
Oh.
Well, very good.

27:27.563 --> 27:30.597
That's, uh...
That's a full-time job,

27:30.599 --> 27:32.966
although I don't know what it
has to do with anything, you know?

27:32.968 --> 27:34.233
You got me.

27:34.235 --> 27:35.934
Here?

27:35.936 --> 27:37.835
Maybe he's just coming to terms
with it, you know?

27:37.837 --> 27:40.304
Maybe he says it to everyone
who comes in here,

27:40.306 --> 27:42.306
his way of trying
to cope with it.

27:42.308 --> 27:43.674
Cope with what?

27:43.676 --> 27:45.676
I mean, his kid's gay.
So what?

27:45.678 --> 27:48.245
Other than the fact that
he can't work for the airlines, apparently,

27:48.247 --> 27:51.848
I don't see
what the problem is.

27:51.850 --> 27:54.984
That's very progressive-sounding
coming out of your mouth.

27:54.986 --> 27:56.585
I'm progressive.

27:56.587 --> 27:57.953
Live and let live,

27:57.955 --> 27:59.754
whatever else you want
to say about it.

27:59.756 --> 28:01.756
Here you go.

28:01.758 --> 28:04.158
And that's got the heat.

28:04.160 --> 28:06.393
Very good.
Very good, indeed.

28:13.267 --> 28:14.599
Ohh! Ohh!

28:15.935 --> 28:17.167
Wow.

28:17.169 --> 28:21.036
Holy shit.
Is that coffee or firewater?

28:21.038 --> 28:22.170
Seriously.

28:22.172 --> 28:23.704
You're a brave soul.

28:23.706 --> 28:25.605
Me?
You must be kidding.

28:25.607 --> 28:28.007
No, you are,
letting some stranger

28:28.009 --> 28:29.808
top off your drink
with anything he sees fit.

28:29.810 --> 28:31.276
Nah, it's...

28:31.278 --> 28:33.945
You have a touch of
the Daredevil in you. Hardly.

28:33.947 --> 28:37.348
This is about as crazy
as I get... almost.

28:37.350 --> 28:39.683
Ooh, cryptic.

28:39.685 --> 28:41.117
Yes. Yes, it is.

28:41.119 --> 28:43.285
I mean, I can't talk.
I'm the same way, so...

28:43.287 --> 28:44.786
Yeah?
Mm.

28:44.788 --> 28:46.621
Well, yeah,
I guess so.

28:46.623 --> 28:48.823
I've worked with you
for, what, two years?

28:48.825 --> 28:50.357
I don't really know
anything about you.

28:50.359 --> 28:52.792
Well, you know
I'm a good coworker.

28:52.794 --> 28:54.693
I'm a valuable member
of the sales team.

28:54.695 --> 28:56.027
What else
is there to know?

28:56.029 --> 28:57.862
Well, nothing,
I suppose,

28:57.864 --> 28:59.730
except most people want to.

28:59.732 --> 29:01.865
They like to know
who they spend time with...

29:01.867 --> 29:03.800
A little something,
anyway.

29:03.802 --> 29:05.168
I'll tell you what...

29:05.170 --> 29:06.369
If you tell me
about this little errand,

29:06.371 --> 29:08.804
I'll give you an earful.
How's that?

29:08.806 --> 29:11.173
And start with that little thing that
you keep pulling out of your wallet...

29:11.175 --> 29:12.174
Very mysterious.

29:12.176 --> 29:14.075
What?
Go on.

29:14.077 --> 29:16.210
It's pretty obvious, though,
the way you keep going back to it.

29:16.212 --> 29:18.212
So?

29:18.214 --> 29:20.247
No. No, no way.

29:20.249 --> 29:21.982
Go on.

29:21.984 --> 29:23.316
No, I'm not playing
that game with you.

29:23.318 --> 29:25.184
Oh, come on.
No.

29:25.186 --> 29:26.218
No.
Unh-Unh.

29:26.220 --> 29:27.686
This...
This is silly.

29:27.688 --> 29:28.887
You have a secret.

29:28.889 --> 29:31.322
Let's just drop it.

29:31.324 --> 29:33.657
Okay, fine, but you're the one
who wanted to get to know one another.

29:33.659 --> 29:35.992
No, no,
I meant... this is...

29:35.994 --> 29:38.694
I meant like zodiac signs,
shit like that.

29:38.696 --> 29:40.696
Well, just tell me something
about yourself.

29:40.698 --> 29:41.830
What'll it hurt?

29:41.832 --> 29:43.031
It's nothing.
I promise.

29:43.033 --> 29:45.033
What is?
The thing.

29:45.035 --> 29:46.334
Th-The piece of paper,
it's... What thing?

29:46.336 --> 29:48.703
I-I made a shopping list.
That's all.

29:48.705 --> 29:50.037
When?
What?

29:50.039 --> 29:52.406
Oh, just... just before
we took off,

29:52.408 --> 29:55.242
when we were waiting on the...
on the Tarmac. That's not true.

29:55.244 --> 29:57.010
What isn't? Well, if you
don't want to tell me, fine,

29:57.012 --> 29:58.077
but don't lie to me.

29:58.079 --> 29:59.845
Who's lying?
You are.

29:59.847 --> 30:01.346
No.
You are.

30:01.348 --> 30:03.014
Yes, you are because you
couldn't have written...

30:03.016 --> 30:05.182
We weren't supposed to be
in Albuquerque today,

30:05.184 --> 30:06.950
so, you know,
how could you have written

30:06.952 --> 30:09.852
a list of things
that you wanted to buy, um,

30:09.854 --> 30:11.186
before we even
got here?

30:11.188 --> 30:13.121
You know, don't...
That's a FIB. I'm sorry.

30:13.123 --> 30:16.390
Well, I...
When I wrote...

30:18.227 --> 30:22.262
All right. Okay. You...
You got me. That's fine.

30:22.264 --> 30:25.865
Here. Here, look,
it's... it's nothing.

30:25.867 --> 30:28.267
I'll show it to you.
Here.

30:28.269 --> 30:29.268
There.

30:29.270 --> 30:31.703
You satisfied?

30:31.705 --> 30:35.105
I-It's just a... it's just
a scrap of paper, that's all.

30:36.440 --> 30:39.208
All right, hand it over if
it's just a scrap.

30:39.210 --> 30:41.443
No, let's just
finish our drinks and...

30:41.445 --> 30:43.144
And get back out there.

30:43.146 --> 30:45.880
I told that guy
we'd be done in an hour.

30:45.882 --> 30:47.281
Fine.

30:48.883 --> 30:51.084
I'm ready, and I'm a Virgo,
by the way.

30:51.086 --> 30:52.785
Oh, good.
Thanks for the information.

30:52.787 --> 30:54.887
Nat, don't.

30:54.889 --> 30:57.256
Don't. No. Give... give it...
Come on, Les. Let me just look at it.

30:57.258 --> 30:58.957
Give it back. God damn it!
All right! Okay! Okay!

30:58.959 --> 31:01.392
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

31:17.174 --> 31:19.742
So, is this gonna be
a big freeze-out now or what?

31:19.744 --> 31:20.909
Pretty much, yeah.

31:20.911 --> 31:22.277
Aw, don't be
that way.

31:22.279 --> 31:24.245
It's fine. Don't worry
about it. Let's just go.

31:24.247 --> 31:25.846
It's no big thing.
I promise.

31:25.848 --> 31:27.180
Yeah, exactly, it's your
"no big thing,"

31:27.182 --> 31:29.415
so I have no business
getting involved.

31:29.417 --> 31:31.784
We're colleagues, that's all, coworkers.
Why should you tell me anything?

31:31.786 --> 31:33.952
I don't tell you anything, so why
should you tell me anything?

31:33.954 --> 31:35.253
So, it's fine.
Let's just leave it.

31:35.255 --> 31:36.787
Nat, I'm not trying
to be all...

31:36.789 --> 31:38.321
And you say
I'm secretive.

31:38.323 --> 31:40.756
Christ.
Look, it's just...

31:40.758 --> 31:41.923
This is...

31:41.925 --> 31:43.190
I just want to know
who Zorro is.

31:43.192 --> 31:44.491
What?

31:44.493 --> 31:45.992
You read it?

31:45.994 --> 31:47.126
Yes.

31:47.128 --> 31:48.794
Oh, shit,
that was...

31:48.796 --> 31:51.096
That... why would you
do that? It was mine.

31:51.098 --> 31:53.264
What would be the point in stealing it
if I wasn't going to bother reading it?

31:53.266 --> 31:55.266
That would be stupid.
Yeah, that's true.

31:55.268 --> 31:56.934
Oh, shit.

31:56.936 --> 31:58.468
Shit. That was not nice.

31:58.470 --> 32:01.804
Sorry. You can cut a Zed
in my forehead if you'd like.

32:01.806 --> 32:03.272
A what?

32:03.274 --> 32:04.206
One of those.

32:04.208 --> 32:05.473
"Z."

32:05.475 --> 32:06.941
That's...
We call that a "Z."

32:06.943 --> 32:09.443
A-Anyway, I-It's not
a person... Zorro.

32:09.445 --> 32:11.878
It's a, uh... it...
Stop lying.

32:11.880 --> 32:13.212
If you're not
gonna tell the truth,

32:13.214 --> 32:16.782
then just don't
say anything at all.

32:16.784 --> 32:18.049
I'm calling the airlines.

32:18.051 --> 32:19.950
No. No,
don't do that.

32:19.952 --> 32:21.885
No, wait a minute, wait a minute.
Wait. Don't. Don't. Please don't.

32:21.887 --> 32:24.287
I'm gonna... I'm gonna tell you.
I'm gonna tell, all right?

32:24.289 --> 32:26.222
It's... I'm...

32:26.224 --> 32:28.123
I... oh, shit.

32:28.125 --> 32:30.024
Oh, it's sexual,
isn't it?

32:30.026 --> 32:31.458
Isn't it?
What is?

32:31.460 --> 32:33.326
Jesus, come on,
the thing, what you're hiding.

32:33.328 --> 32:35.795
That's what we spend
most of our time lying about,

32:35.797 --> 32:38.230
and people in the states are the
worst about it, man, such fucking puritans,

32:38.232 --> 32:40.498
the fear that somebody's gonna
find out we like it or love it

32:40.500 --> 32:42.066
or how we love it
or want to try it

32:42.068 --> 32:43.801
or things we haven't
done yet but want to

32:43.803 --> 32:45.002
or people
we've done it with.

32:45.004 --> 32:47.004
And I say,
who fucking cares, you know?

32:47.006 --> 32:48.839
Because this is life.

32:48.841 --> 32:50.340
This is all part of life,
and this is your life,

32:50.342 --> 32:52.141
so you just have to
try and be yourself, Les.

32:52.143 --> 32:53.976
I mean, God, we're only here
once. This is a one-time deal.

32:53.978 --> 32:55.477
The Hindus are off
their fucking rockers.

32:55.479 --> 32:59.480
This is a one-time deal,
and so...

32:59.482 --> 33:02.816
Fuck it.
Do what you want, Les.

33:02.818 --> 33:04.818
Wow. Sorry.
It's a pet hate.

33:04.820 --> 33:07.020
I guess. You're never
gonna tell me, are you,

33:07.022 --> 33:08.988
anything real?

33:08.990 --> 33:10.322
I mean, I-I want...

33:10.324 --> 33:12.090
Oh, this is pathetic!
Men are pathetic!

33:12.092 --> 33:14.225
Oh, now, wait a minute.
Hey, hey, it's private.

33:14.227 --> 33:16.060
So?!
So...

33:16.062 --> 33:18.262
S-so maybe I don't
want to tell you.

33:18.264 --> 33:20.163
Is it bigger than this?

33:20.165 --> 33:22.365
Is it
more private than this?

33:27.437 --> 33:29.471
I assume
that's not a necklace.

33:29.473 --> 33:31.473
Hardly.

33:31.475 --> 33:33.475
Then...?

33:33.477 --> 33:36.511
My girlfriend has me wear it
when I'm away.

33:36.513 --> 33:38.045
It's a collar.

33:38.047 --> 33:39.646
Oh.

33:39.648 --> 33:42.048
Oh, well,
that's, uh...

33:42.050 --> 33:43.215
Why?

33:45.451 --> 33:47.618
Why do you think?

33:47.620 --> 33:49.186
Because...

33:49.188 --> 33:51.021
Sh-she's
a Locksmith?

33:51.023 --> 33:52.555
Not funny, Les.

33:52.557 --> 33:54.957
Well, I don't know.

33:57.461 --> 34:00.628
Because that's
the Nature of our situation,

34:00.630 --> 34:03.197
our relationship.

34:03.199 --> 34:04.298
She doesn't trust you?

34:04.300 --> 34:05.966
No. We ha...
We have trust.

34:05.968 --> 34:08.568
Lots of trust.

34:08.570 --> 34:12.371
Okay.

34:12.373 --> 34:14.205
I'm a Sub...

34:16.474 --> 34:17.574
...and she's a Dom.

34:17.576 --> 34:19.576
Do you understand
those words?

34:19.578 --> 34:22.378
What, you mean like
bondage and... and stuff?

34:22.380 --> 34:24.545
Yeah, well, some...
bondage stuff?

34:24.547 --> 34:26.714
Yeah. I mean, something like
that and nothing like that.

34:26.716 --> 34:30.050
Oh.
That's just her thing.

34:30.052 --> 34:32.485
No wonder you never show up
at the Christmas parties.

34:32.487 --> 34:34.018
What?

34:34.021 --> 34:35.987
Are you uncomfortable?

34:35.989 --> 34:37.487
A bit.
Why?

34:37.489 --> 34:40.157
I'm still the same person
I was five minutes ago.

34:40.159 --> 34:42.159
Yeah, but with a collar
around your neck.

34:42.161 --> 34:43.426
Yeah, there is that.

34:43.428 --> 34:44.527
Anything else?

34:44.529 --> 34:46.228
Don't push it, Les.

34:46.230 --> 34:48.196
I just
trusted you, okay?

34:48.197 --> 34:50.764
I just told you something
that no one else at work knows.

34:52.100 --> 34:53.667
So?

35:01.408 --> 35:04.443
And then I went back
at 7:00.

35:04.445 --> 35:07.245
A.M.?

35:07.247 --> 35:09.180
Wow.
"Wow"?

35:09.182 --> 35:11.615
I mean...

35:11.617 --> 35:14.351
Wow. I give it to you,
I-I'm surprised.

35:14.353 --> 35:16.119
And you'd never done anything
of that kind before?

35:16.121 --> 35:17.520
Of course not, no.

35:17.522 --> 35:20.189
No, not ever.

35:22.126 --> 35:23.692
Have you told your wife
about it?

35:23.694 --> 35:25.427
Are you kidding?

35:25.429 --> 35:28.129
No.
I just... I mean...

35:28.131 --> 35:29.430
Believe me,
this is not something

35:29.432 --> 35:31.198
you... you tell somebody,

35:31.200 --> 35:33.533
not somebody you hope
might love you in the future.

35:33.535 --> 35:35.034
Ah.

35:35.036 --> 35:38.203
Les, please,
that's...

35:38.205 --> 35:39.370
What?
"Please" what?

35:39.372 --> 35:41.138
Well, I mean,
you slept with someone.

35:41.140 --> 35:42.572
A marriage
can survive that.

35:42.574 --> 35:44.206
Sometimes, yeah, but...

35:44.208 --> 35:45.574
Well, they do
all the time.

35:45.576 --> 35:48.209
Yeah, I know that.
I-I'm not an idiot.

35:48.211 --> 35:49.610
I'm not
some country rube

35:49.612 --> 35:52.379
just... just blundering around
in the big city.

35:52.381 --> 35:54.214
Or the
medium-sized city,

35:54.216 --> 35:56.049
whatever...
Whatever this place is.

35:56.051 --> 35:59.451
I-I-I know
that it's possible.

35:59.453 --> 36:00.585
So, then?

36:00.587 --> 36:03.554
So... so, what
I just said.

36:03.556 --> 36:04.788
I just sat here
and told you

36:04.790 --> 36:07.390
about this evening
that I spent, uh,

36:07.392 --> 36:10.559
an evening that I...
That I barely remember.

36:10.561 --> 36:13.061
I don't know
what I'd tell her.

36:13.063 --> 36:15.663
And if I did know,
I still wouldn't.

36:15.665 --> 36:17.665
Well, you just tell her
what happened.

36:17.667 --> 36:20.067
Oh Yeah, sure.

36:20.069 --> 36:21.802
"Hi, honey.
I-I-I'm home for dinner.

36:21.804 --> 36:24.671
Oh, by the way, I fucked
somebody in Albuquerque.

36:24.673 --> 36:26.272
No, I don't know who,

36:26.274 --> 36:28.741
but it was some fantastic,
crazy shit,

36:28.743 --> 36:30.442
really...
really mind-blowing."

36:30.444 --> 36:32.410
Something like that?
Does... does that work?

36:32.412 --> 36:33.811
No. Just tell her
the truth.

36:33.813 --> 36:35.145
And what might
that be?

36:35.147 --> 36:36.813
I don't know,
that you had sex,

36:36.815 --> 36:38.514
and not just sex
but sex in a new way,

36:38.516 --> 36:40.816
differently
and... and bravely.

36:40.818 --> 36:42.584
Yeah, in the ass.

36:42.586 --> 36:44.285
Yes, in the ass.
So what? Shh. Do you mind?

36:44.287 --> 36:46.287
Jesus,
will you keep it down?

36:46.289 --> 36:48.088
You have a real problem
with the truth, don't you, Les?

36:48.090 --> 36:49.322
No, I don't.

36:49.324 --> 36:51.590
Not as a concept.
I like it just fine.

36:51.592 --> 36:54.359
I-I'm not nuts about telling
everybody in New Mexico

36:54.361 --> 36:56.721
about my...
My indiscretion.

36:58.197 --> 37:01.198
Um, it's...

37:01.200 --> 37:03.166
I-It's called
a dirty weekend,

37:03.168 --> 37:06.702
when you go off with someone
and do things, you know...

37:06.704 --> 37:08.670
If you look on the bright side,
you never know,

37:08.672 --> 37:12.340
it might spice up whatever it is
you're in, your marriage.

37:12.342 --> 37:15.343
Uh... I-I don't think so.

37:15.345 --> 37:17.378
I mean, you might...
You might be surprised.

37:17.380 --> 37:19.446
I doubt it.
Right.

37:19.448 --> 37:21.314
Well, you never know, Les.
Yeah. Uh, yeah,

37:21.316 --> 37:23.849
th-th-the new
cure-all... sodomy.

37:26.485 --> 37:28.819
It's really eating away
at you, isn't it?

37:28.821 --> 37:30.387
You need to do something
about it.

37:30.389 --> 37:32.622
Yeah, I-I...
I don't make waves.

37:32.624 --> 37:34.123
I'm not that kind of guy.

37:34.125 --> 37:36.859
I'm not the guy
who does that.

37:36.861 --> 37:40.328
I-I-I go around doing what
I need to do, and that's all.

37:40.330 --> 37:42.129
Okay.

37:42.131 --> 37:44.331
Whatever you say.

37:44.333 --> 37:46.800
I mean...

37:46.802 --> 37:50.136
Except for that one night, eh?
Yeah.

37:50.138 --> 37:51.637
Yeah, except then.

37:57.376 --> 37:59.176
You liked it.

37:59.178 --> 38:00.410
I don't know.

38:00.412 --> 38:01.711
You liked it.
No.

38:01.713 --> 38:04.146
You do. You... you like it.
You liked it.

38:04.148 --> 38:05.547
It was different.

38:05.549 --> 38:08.683
I was very drunk,
and she was beautiful.

38:08.685 --> 38:12.586
And... and, yeah, she
might have been a he, maybe.

38:12.588 --> 38:14.220
If you didn't like it,

38:14.222 --> 38:16.655
then we wouldn't be here
in the middle of Albuquerque

38:16.657 --> 38:18.490
trying to find
this place, okay?

38:18.492 --> 38:19.891
So, just say
that you liked it.

38:19.893 --> 38:21.492
I don't know
if I liked it.

38:21.494 --> 38:23.861
You're not supposed to like
things like that.

38:23.863 --> 38:25.195
No, I don't.

38:25.197 --> 38:27.330
I do not.
I don't like it.

38:27.332 --> 38:28.531
It just happened.

38:28.533 --> 38:30.399
I don't believe you.

38:30.401 --> 38:31.666
Yeah, well,
so you don't believe me.

38:31.668 --> 38:33.501
Check-fucking-mate.

38:33.503 --> 38:36.770
This is crazy. Why am I
even discussing this with you?

38:36.772 --> 38:40.873
This is stupid, me telling you.
It did not help to share it.

38:40.875 --> 38:42.875
I do not feel better.

38:42.877 --> 38:45.510
Here why don't you
pay for that?

38:45.512 --> 38:46.844
For once.

38:58.256 --> 38:59.521
You're scared.

38:59.523 --> 39:00.922
Oh, stop.

39:00.924 --> 39:03.357
You are. You're scared
of what you're feeling

39:03.359 --> 39:04.391
and what it means.

39:04.393 --> 39:07.527
Natalie, don't, really.

39:07.529 --> 39:10.696
Well, we've come
this far.

39:10.698 --> 39:12.431
Don't you think
that we should finish it?

39:12.433 --> 39:13.765
Finish...
Finish what?

39:13.767 --> 39:15.700
What... and what is
this "we" crap?

39:15.702 --> 39:17.301
We're not
in this together.

39:17.303 --> 39:20.270
This is about me
and... and my stuff.

39:20.272 --> 39:22.205
<i>I</i> have stuff, too!

39:22.207 --> 39:24.207
Yes, I know that,
and I don't care about it

39:24.209 --> 39:25.274
because it's <i> your</i> stuff.

39:25.276 --> 39:26.575
It's not my stuff.

39:26.577 --> 39:28.810
I don't think we should
intermingle our stuff.

39:28.812 --> 39:32.313
This will... this will
haunt you, Les. I promise.

39:32.315 --> 39:34.281
No, it won't because
I'm closing a door,

39:34.283 --> 39:36.283
a door I never should have
opened in the first PLA...

39:36.285 --> 39:37.884
I had no business
opening it.

39:37.886 --> 39:39.218
I made a mistake.

39:39.220 --> 39:40.719
I drank too much.

39:40.721 --> 39:42.587
I do that sometimes,
and...

39:42.589 --> 39:45.389
And my fault
I did a stupid fucking thing.

39:45.391 --> 39:47.290
A thing
that you enjoyed.

39:47.292 --> 39:49.258
Ah, so what?
That doesn't matter.

39:49.260 --> 39:51.893
I might enjoy
bank robbery

39:51.895 --> 39:55.596
or... or... or... or sky-diving
or that idiotic bungee shit.

39:55.598 --> 39:57.731
But you know what?
I'm never gonna do those things.

39:57.733 --> 39:59.933
And I'm... I'm absolutely
okay about it.

39:59.935 --> 40:02.302
Fine.
Yeah, it is fine.

40:02.304 --> 40:03.903
You've lived
this long being a coward.

40:03.905 --> 40:05.337
Why should it
bother me?

40:05.339 --> 40:06.905
I... oh, please.

40:06.907 --> 40:08.573
A lot of people find that stuff
out about themselves,

40:08.575 --> 40:10.341
and they just
limp along in life,

40:10.343 --> 40:12.576
just slithering along with
all the other fucking cowards.

40:12.578 --> 40:14.411
What, do they
teach you that in Cambridge?

40:14.413 --> 40:15.912
Because if they did,
you got screwed.

40:15.914 --> 40:17.413
You know what,
you can say what you want,

40:17.415 --> 40:18.681
but the truth is,
you're running away.

40:18.683 --> 40:20.716
Yeah, of course I am.
I am.

40:20.718 --> 40:22.684
See?
Yeah, absolutely,

40:22.686 --> 40:23.851
and with good reason...

40:23.853 --> 40:25.419
Because I have
commitments to people

40:25.421 --> 40:27.687
and... and this
isn't me.

40:27.689 --> 40:29.455
Yeah, I think about it

40:29.457 --> 40:31.523
a-and I was curious
about what happened,

40:31.525 --> 40:32.690
but it's... it's not me.

40:32.692 --> 40:35.426
This is...
This is not who I am.

40:35.428 --> 40:37.895
I-I-I'm not
at a stage in my life

40:37.897 --> 40:40.464
where I can just
start exploring things.

40:40.466 --> 40:42.532
I don't chase women
at the office.

40:42.534 --> 40:44.467
I don't want to fuck <i> you.</i>
What?

40:44.469 --> 40:46.368
I'm sorry, but I don't.
Okay.

40:46.370 --> 40:48.703
I may be the only man in the
company that doesn't want to fuck you,

40:48.705 --> 40:50.571
but I don't want to...
To fuck you.

40:50.573 --> 40:52.539
So, can we just... can we just
stop it, please? Can we...

40:52.541 --> 40:55.375
Yes, good. Please let's.
Of course. Good.

40:55.377 --> 40:58.411
We don't ever need to talk
about that ever again. Thank you.

40:58.413 --> 41:00.379
You're a pussy.
Let's just leave it at that.

41:00.381 --> 41:02.080
Oh, ow. Ow, ow.

41:02.082 --> 41:03.381
That really hurt.

41:03.383 --> 41:04.548
And you know what?

41:04.550 --> 41:06.716
Women never
used to talk like that,

41:06.718 --> 41:08.784
you know, that kind
of Vulgar language.

41:08.786 --> 41:10.552
It wasn't meant
to hurt, Les.

41:10.554 --> 41:12.654
It was a statement of fact.
That's all.

41:12.656 --> 41:13.888
You know what?

41:13.890 --> 41:15.389
This is so...

41:15.391 --> 41:17.424
And why do you care, huh?

41:17.426 --> 41:18.725
I don't get it, really.

41:18.727 --> 41:20.560
Really, why do you
care so much, huh?

41:20.562 --> 41:22.662
Well, I don't anymore.

41:22.664 --> 41:24.630
I mean, you keep
pushing me about it.

41:24.632 --> 41:27.933
You act like it's some huge deal
that I be brave,

41:27.935 --> 41:29.601
huh, and all that
kind of shit,

41:29.603 --> 41:31.502
that I find out
who I... who I really am?

41:31.504 --> 41:33.437
Okay.
I won't anymore.

41:33.439 --> 41:35.472
Maybe you just want
to hang out with people

41:35.474 --> 41:38.675
who are into the same kind of
crazy shit that <i> you</i> like, huh?

41:43.480 --> 41:44.913
What do you mean
by that?

41:44.915 --> 41:45.914
Nothing. I don't...

41:45.916 --> 41:46.981
Forget it.

41:46.983 --> 41:48.983
But you said it, so...

41:48.985 --> 41:50.617
Nat, please.
Can we just drop it?

41:50.619 --> 41:51.951
No, I'm not going to.

41:51.953 --> 41:53.118
You took something
that I told you privately

41:53.120 --> 41:54.486
and you threw it back
in my face.

41:54.488 --> 41:55.587
No, I did not.

41:55.589 --> 41:56.854
You did.
You just did.

41:56.856 --> 41:58.922
I-I didn't mean "crazy."

41:58.924 --> 42:00.423
But you said it.

42:00.425 --> 42:02.158
Look, all right, I take it back.
I'm sorry.

42:02.160 --> 42:03.592
Forget it.
No, but you meant it.

42:03.594 --> 42:05.093
That's what you think
about what I do,

42:05.095 --> 42:06.127
so that's why you said it.

42:06.129 --> 42:07.428
No. Listen.

42:07.430 --> 42:08.495
No, you listen.

42:08.497 --> 42:09.996
You're a fucking coward,

42:09.998 --> 42:12.098
and you want to go and crawl
under some rock somewhere now,

42:12.100 --> 42:14.100
thinking that will make it
all go away, but it won't.

42:14.102 --> 42:16.936
You'll start finding ways
to go and sneak on the Internet

42:16.938 --> 42:18.938
or buy some magazines
or go to places,

42:18.940 --> 42:20.439
places where you can...

42:20.441 --> 42:21.773
I don't know...
Watch or something and...

42:21.775 --> 42:24.542
The point is, Les,
it's not gonna go away.

42:24.544 --> 42:26.043
I know it
'cause I've been you.

42:26.045 --> 42:28.612
I've been you, Les,
and I know how it works, okay?

42:28.614 --> 42:30.947
And I'm telling you
that some way or another,

42:30.949 --> 42:32.782
this is gonna spin
out of you,

42:32.784 --> 42:35.017
and it's gonna hurt somebody
or a whole lot of somebodies

42:35.019 --> 42:37.686
if you don't just face it
head on.

42:37.688 --> 42:39.788
Nat...

42:39.790 --> 42:43.124
Nat, all due respect,
what are you suggesting here?

42:43.126 --> 42:46.060
That I track this person down
and have sex again?

42:46.062 --> 42:49.063
See if I get off
on it again?

42:52.534 --> 42:55.569
I mean,
isn't that why we're here?

42:55.571 --> 42:57.136
I...

42:59.973 --> 43:01.640
I thought about it.

43:01.642 --> 43:05.176
I thought about it
for a minute, but, I mean...

43:05.178 --> 43:06.677
I mean, come on.

43:06.679 --> 43:08.145
What...
What am I actually...

43:08.147 --> 43:09.880
What am I actually
supposed to do?

43:09.882 --> 43:11.648
What if I like it?

43:11.650 --> 43:13.149
What if I do like guys?

43:13.151 --> 43:14.817
Or even other women?

43:14.819 --> 43:17.820
What if I enjoy getting off
with other people?

43:17.822 --> 43:19.655
What then, huh?
What?

43:19.657 --> 43:20.989
Well, at least you'll know.

43:20.991 --> 43:21.990
What? Know what?

43:21.992 --> 43:23.758
Who you are.

43:23.760 --> 43:26.060
You know,
we'll find this Zorro person.

43:26.062 --> 43:27.528
Zorro isn't...
isn't a person.

43:27.530 --> 43:28.529
I told you.

43:28.531 --> 43:30.497
Whatever it is.

43:30.499 --> 43:31.998
It's a club,

43:32.000 --> 43:34.767
a-a place that I went to
when I was here last.

43:34.769 --> 43:36.568
And I had a drink, and...

43:37.704 --> 43:39.537
And that's all.
That's all?

43:39.539 --> 43:40.838
Well,
you know what happened.

43:40.840 --> 43:41.939
Yeah, yeah, I do.

43:41.941 --> 43:44.708
And then I...
When I woke up

43:44.710 --> 43:49.044
and we were in the process
of landing here in...

43:49.046 --> 43:52.547
In Albuquerque,
and I thought...

43:52.549 --> 43:56.550
It hit me... maybe this is...
This is supposed to happen

43:56.552 --> 43:59.686
so that I could...
That I could finally...

43:59.688 --> 44:03.689
Finally get rid
of this... this...

44:03.691 --> 44:05.691
I don't know...
This feeling.

44:05.693 --> 44:07.592
I understand.

44:07.594 --> 44:10.094
I think about it
all the time.

44:10.096 --> 44:12.696
I get it, Les.
I do.

44:12.698 --> 44:15.131
And it's not because
it was pleasurable or whatnot.

44:15.133 --> 44:16.866
I mean, it was.

44:16.868 --> 44:20.202
It's because... it's because
I did a really bad thing.

44:20.204 --> 44:21.269
Says who?

44:21.271 --> 44:23.237
Says the world,
everybody,

44:23.239 --> 44:26.873
many people,
people of my generation.

44:26.875 --> 44:29.041
What I did is wrong
in the eyes of most...

44:29.043 --> 44:30.876
Most everybody else
in the world,

44:30.878 --> 44:32.878
and that...
That weighs on me.

44:32.880 --> 44:33.879
It does.

44:33.881 --> 44:35.213
And yet?

44:35.215 --> 44:38.849
And yet I can't forget
that evening.

44:41.552 --> 44:43.286
Fuck.

44:47.724 --> 44:51.926
So, you still want to
go back to the hotel or...?

44:51.928 --> 44:54.762
Yeah. I guess.

44:54.764 --> 44:56.830
I don't know.

45:10.576 --> 45:13.811
Hi. I'm working.

45:15.580 --> 45:17.747
Hi.

45:17.749 --> 45:21.250
No, I'm working.
That's not possible right now.

45:25.254 --> 45:27.822
No.

45:27.824 --> 45:31.358
I am wear...
I am wearing it, yes.

45:32.626 --> 45:35.827
Promise.
I promise I'm wearing it.

45:38.330 --> 45:40.864
No, I can't...
I can't take a picture.

45:45.201 --> 45:46.634
But, Angie, don't hang up.

45:46.636 --> 45:49.836
I just can't take a pic...

45:53.274 --> 45:55.107
She hung up.

46:17.360 --> 46:19.627
No.

46:19.629 --> 46:21.996
No, nothing yet.

46:21.998 --> 46:24.732
No, this thing
doesn't seem to be...

46:24.734 --> 46:27.201
Yep.

46:27.203 --> 46:29.303
Yeah, so we might be stuck here
tonight,

46:29.305 --> 46:31.038
which really stinks,
you know?

46:31.040 --> 46:34.640
It really...

46:34.642 --> 46:35.974
Yeah.

46:35.976 --> 46:38.242
Yeah, because tomorrow
we're supposed to be in...

46:38.244 --> 46:44.180
Exactly, in Dallas,
and that's... what's that?

46:44.182 --> 46:46.382
Yeah.
Well, that's true.

46:46.384 --> 46:49.885
Yes. No.

46:49.887 --> 46:52.921
No. I've been here before,
so...

46:52.923 --> 46:54.756
Yeah, at least I know
some local restaurants

46:54.758 --> 46:55.823
and stuff.

46:55.825 --> 46:57.825
That's true, sweetie.

46:57.827 --> 47:00.327
Yeah.

47:00.329 --> 47:03.330
Well, probably just get a...
A nice meal or something,

47:03.332 --> 47:06.232
go to bed early.

47:06.234 --> 47:09.335
Mm-hmm.

47:09.337 --> 47:12.371
No, my phone
is working now.

47:12.373 --> 47:13.872
Well, I don't know why,
either.

47:13.874 --> 47:16.241
It just is.

47:16.243 --> 47:17.709
Yeah.

47:17.711 --> 47:19.744
Well,
we're on a higher floor.

47:19.746 --> 47:21.712
No. No, we're not in a...

47:21.714 --> 47:23.880
We're not in a room.
We're in some kind of...

47:23.882 --> 47:26.749
Some kind of lounge
or something like that.

47:26.751 --> 47:28.350
Anyway, my phone's working.

47:28.352 --> 47:31.886
Sometimes things like that
happen.

47:31.888 --> 47:34.421
No, I don't think
it's a miracle.

47:34.423 --> 47:36.389
No, I don't.

47:36.391 --> 47:38.224
No.

47:38.226 --> 47:40.059
I think it has more to do
with my carrier

47:40.061 --> 47:43.128
than it does with Jesus.

47:54.373 --> 47:56.874
Uh, there's...

47:58.077 --> 48:01.144
I think I'm gonna go back...
Into town.

48:01.146 --> 48:03.045
But we just got here.

48:03.047 --> 48:04.046
I know.

48:04.048 --> 48:05.414
I know, but...

48:05.416 --> 48:07.082
Okay.

48:07.084 --> 48:09.185
I need to. It's...

48:09.187 --> 48:10.386
I get it.

48:10.388 --> 48:11.887
All right.

48:13.155 --> 48:14.989
Do you want me to come?

48:14.991 --> 48:16.991
Oh, do what
you want to do.

48:16.993 --> 48:18.826
I want to come with you.

48:18.828 --> 48:20.027
All right.

48:20.029 --> 48:21.395
"Butch and Sundance,"
remember?

48:21.397 --> 48:23.063
We have to protect
the Ampersand.

48:23.065 --> 48:26.899
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

48:26.901 --> 48:28.400
Let's do it.

48:33.505 --> 48:37.107
And, uh...

48:37.109 --> 48:38.241
Thanks.

48:38.243 --> 48:39.508
You're welcome.

48:39.510 --> 48:42.010
Thank you, and...

48:42.012 --> 48:45.380
I-I don't think
you're crazy.

48:45.382 --> 48:48.383
And I don't care
what you think, so...

48:48.385 --> 48:50.251
No worries.

48:50.253 --> 48:52.419
All right.

48:52.421 --> 48:54.521
Off we go.

48:58.058 --> 49:01.093
You want to have them watch that
for you behind the desk?

49:01.095 --> 49:02.335
That's all right.

49:03.396 --> 49:05.864
You know
what's probably gonna come

49:05.866 --> 49:07.899
of this whole thing,
honestly?

49:07.901 --> 49:10.968
We're gonna run all the way
back into town,

49:10.970 --> 49:14.438
I'm gonna find this person
who I-I spent time with,

49:14.440 --> 49:17.274
and she's gonna turn out
to be this...

49:17.276 --> 49:20.110
This knockout...
This hot girl.

49:20.112 --> 49:22.545
And all that's gonna come
of this whole thing

49:22.547 --> 49:25.247
is that I'm gonna feel bad
about what I've done

49:25.249 --> 49:29.050
in a completely normal
and heterosexual way.

49:29.052 --> 49:31.118
That's what's gonna happen.

49:31.120 --> 49:32.319
I promise.

49:32.321 --> 49:35.221
Bet you 50 bucks
that's what happens.

49:35.223 --> 49:36.622
You watch.

49:47.166 --> 49:48.232
Hey, buddy.

49:48.234 --> 49:50.334
Seriously?

49:50.336 --> 49:52.969
'Tis I. Hop in.

49:58.941 --> 50:01.909
Does any of this
look familiar?

50:01.911 --> 50:02.976
Not to me.

50:02.978 --> 50:05.244
I've only been here once.

50:05.246 --> 50:06.366
Hey, cabby.

50:07.281 --> 50:08.280
How's it going?

50:08.282 --> 50:09.914
All good, my man.

50:09.916 --> 50:11.482
You know this area
pretty well?

50:11.484 --> 50:12.483
Of course.

50:12.485 --> 50:13.617
It's Albuquerque.

50:13.619 --> 50:15.018
I know Albuquerque.

50:15.020 --> 50:16.419
Uh-huh. Great.

50:16.421 --> 50:20.522
Uh... you know a place called...
Called Zorro?

50:20.524 --> 50:22.090
You ever hear
of that before?

50:22.092 --> 50:23.624
I-it's meant to be
around here somewhere.

50:23.626 --> 50:25.125
The gay place.

50:25.127 --> 50:27.460
Uh...

50:27.462 --> 50:29.462
Yeah.

50:29.464 --> 50:31.430
Maybe. Could be.

50:31.432 --> 50:33.432
If you're talking about Zorro,

50:33.434 --> 50:34.466
the gay place,

50:34.468 --> 50:35.967
I know where it is.

50:35.969 --> 50:37.668
But it's not...
It's not, uh...

50:37.670 --> 50:39.603
It's not just a gay club,
is it?

50:39.605 --> 50:41.137
I mean, I-I thought
it was m-more...

50:41.139 --> 50:42.138
Exclusively.

50:42.140 --> 50:43.439
Ah.

50:43.441 --> 50:44.606
Super gay.

50:44.608 --> 50:46.507
Got it.

50:46.509 --> 50:49.042
Hey.
We haven't found her yet.

50:52.012 --> 50:54.313
Here...

50:54.315 --> 50:55.681
Here's $20 for now.

50:55.683 --> 50:58.016
And I'll give you the rest
when we're sure.

50:58.018 --> 50:59.283
I mean,
they let chicks in there,

50:59.285 --> 51:01.285
so it's not racist
or anything.

51:01.287 --> 51:04.021
But it is mostly
for the gays.

51:04.023 --> 51:05.989
I see. Okay.

51:05.991 --> 51:07.223
Cool.

51:07.225 --> 51:09.191
Is that where
you two want to go?

51:09.193 --> 51:13.127
Um... well, we're, uh...

51:13.129 --> 51:14.995
Oh, all right.

51:14.997 --> 51:16.463
Yeah,
that would be good.

51:16.465 --> 51:17.564
Take us there.

51:17.566 --> 51:18.631
Just say the word, friend.

51:18.633 --> 51:22.434
Yes. Please. Zorro.

51:25.471 --> 51:27.305
Racist?

51:27.307 --> 51:29.707
I vote
we just let it go.

51:56.666 --> 51:58.767
Thanks, buddy.

52:22.387 --> 52:23.687
Hey there. Hello.

52:23.689 --> 52:25.021
How are we today?

52:25.023 --> 52:26.622
Pretty good.
Not too bad.

52:26.624 --> 52:29.091
Fine. Thanks.

52:29.093 --> 52:31.359
You guys know this is
an applebee's, right?

52:31.361 --> 52:33.260
Mm.
Oh, yeah, yeah.

52:33.262 --> 52:34.361
We get it.

52:34.363 --> 52:35.695
Okay. Good.

52:35.697 --> 52:39.531
You know,
we're aware of the, uh...

52:40.366 --> 52:41.366
The what?

52:41.368 --> 52:43.067
You know.

52:43.069 --> 52:44.735
Sorry. What?

52:44.737 --> 52:47.503
Well,
this a gay bar, right?

52:49.205 --> 52:51.372
Let me check.

52:51.374 --> 52:54.241
Hey, folks,
is this here a gay bar?

52:56.044 --> 52:58.611
Gee. I'm not sure.

52:58.613 --> 53:00.546
Guess you're gonna have to find
that one out all on your own.

53:00.548 --> 53:02.648
So, I'll have a Martini...
Vodka, not Gin...

53:02.650 --> 53:05.050
And the same, I think,
for my colleague here.

53:05.052 --> 53:07.052
You got it, sugar.
Thank you.

53:07.054 --> 53:09.754
So, does any of this
look familiar?

53:09.756 --> 53:12.456
Mnh...

53:12.458 --> 53:14.124
Do you recognize anybody?

53:14.126 --> 53:16.559
Well, what would the chances
of that be?

53:16.561 --> 53:18.961
You know, Les,
life is funny.

53:22.297 --> 53:25.098
Mnh.

53:36.073 --> 53:37.606
Okay.

53:37.608 --> 53:39.741
Did you want to carry a tab
or pay up?

53:39.743 --> 53:41.075
Oh.

53:41.077 --> 53:43.477
I-I'll run a tab
for a minute.

53:44.412 --> 53:46.346
Thank you.
You got it, sister.

53:49.183 --> 53:50.716
Cheers.

54:02.594 --> 54:05.261
So, what about you?

54:05.263 --> 54:06.262
Hmm?

54:06.264 --> 54:07.896
Your relationship.

54:09.632 --> 54:11.299
I told you
that it's private.

54:11.301 --> 54:13.534
Yeah, but...

54:13.536 --> 54:14.535
And it is.

54:14.537 --> 54:15.602
I know. I know.

54:15.604 --> 54:16.836
But you told me about it.

54:16.838 --> 54:18.771
Well, not about it...
That I do it,

54:18.773 --> 54:20.606
that it's my lifestyle,
but I...

54:20.608 --> 54:22.507
I'm still not open
to discussing it.

54:22.509 --> 54:24.108
I see.

54:24.110 --> 54:25.509
Sorry.

54:25.511 --> 54:27.444
It's not like earth-shaking news
I'm asking here.

54:27.446 --> 54:30.780
I mean,
I already know the big stuff.

54:32.350 --> 54:33.682
I'm just curious.

54:33.684 --> 54:36.685
I mean, how long
have you guys been together?

54:36.687 --> 54:39.688
Oh, uh...

54:39.690 --> 54:41.690
Awhile...

54:41.692 --> 54:44.392
Maybe a year this time.

54:44.394 --> 54:46.460
And is that exclusive or...

54:46.462 --> 54:49.196
I-I don't really
know how these things work.

54:49.198 --> 54:50.330
What things?

54:50.332 --> 54:51.464
Well, you know,

54:51.466 --> 54:53.299
things where two people
are in love,

54:53.301 --> 54:56.135
but there are, uh,
accessories.

54:56.137 --> 54:58.804
You know, ropes,
stuff like that.

54:58.806 --> 55:01.373
I've seen pictures
of this stuff, and...

55:01.375 --> 55:03.408
And sometimes
other people are there.

55:03.410 --> 55:05.410
Where?
What pictures have you seen?

55:05.412 --> 55:08.879
Well, just, you know,
magazines and the Internet.

55:10.581 --> 55:12.415
I mean, I suppose it might be
true for some people,

55:12.417 --> 55:14.183
but it's not true for us.

55:14.185 --> 55:15.584
All right, all right,
I get that.

55:15.586 --> 55:18.219
She's, uh...

55:18.221 --> 55:20.154
Very possessive,
so I shouldn't... I...

55:20.156 --> 55:21.421
I'm actually not... I...

55:21.423 --> 55:22.588
Do you mind
if we don't discuss it?

55:22.590 --> 55:24.156
Sure. Yeah. Okay.

55:24.158 --> 55:25.557
Thanks.

55:25.559 --> 55:27.658
Good.

55:30.361 --> 55:32.528
But have you two ever...
Les, don't be a perv.

55:32.530 --> 55:34.897
No, no, I-I'm not talking about
the bondage part.

55:34.899 --> 55:37.165
I'm just saying, as people,

55:37.167 --> 55:41.536
a-as two people
in a relationship...

55:41.538 --> 55:44.272
Well...

55:44.274 --> 55:48.275
Have you ever cheated
on each other?

55:48.277 --> 55:51.444
That's all.
That's all I wanted to know.

55:51.446 --> 55:53.712
Because I told you
what I did.

55:53.714 --> 55:56.548
So I thought maybe
you might want to,

55:56.550 --> 55:59.284
uh...

55:59.286 --> 56:01.653
But that's fine.

56:01.655 --> 56:03.988
You don't have to say
anything.

56:06.792 --> 56:08.992
It doesn't matter.

56:08.994 --> 56:14.796
It's not gonna change
what <i> I</i> did, so, uh...

56:14.798 --> 56:17.064
Mnh.

56:19.000 --> 56:20.800
Yes.

56:20.802 --> 56:22.968
Sorry?

56:22.970 --> 56:25.470
She cheated on me once.

56:25.472 --> 56:27.305
Oh.

56:27.307 --> 56:29.674
She says once.
I think once.

56:29.676 --> 56:32.510
Got it.

56:32.512 --> 56:34.545
There's just no way
of knowing with her

56:34.547 --> 56:35.913
if she's telling the truth
or not, you know?

56:35.915 --> 56:39.716
Yeah. And...
And that bothers you.

56:41.318 --> 56:43.752
Yes,
it fucking bothers me.

56:43.754 --> 56:46.387
Of course
it fucking bothers me.

56:46.389 --> 56:48.322
Okay.

56:48.324 --> 56:50.023
I have to wear
a fucking collar.

56:50.025 --> 56:52.992
And sometimes I can't breathe
and it chokes me.

56:52.994 --> 56:54.693
So, that bothers me.

56:54.695 --> 56:56.828
And then I have to cover it up
at work,

56:56.830 --> 56:58.663
so I get really hot
all the time.

56:58.665 --> 57:00.331
So, that fucking bothers me.

57:00.333 --> 57:02.900
So, yes, the whole fucking thing
bothers me, Les.

57:02.902 --> 57:05.902
Okay.
I'm sorry.

57:08.505 --> 57:10.772
I don't want to talk about her,
though.

57:12.708 --> 57:14.075
Yeah. Yeah. I get that.

57:14.077 --> 57:15.076
At all.

57:15.078 --> 57:16.944
All right.

57:22.916 --> 57:24.549
You're an idiot.

57:24.551 --> 57:27.018
You made me tell you
way more than you've told me.

57:27.020 --> 57:29.020
Well, no, no. I had to pull
that shit out of you earlier.

57:29.022 --> 57:30.454
No, that's not...
That's not true. Yes, I did.

57:30.456 --> 57:32.422
I had to fucking
pull it out of you.

57:32.424 --> 57:34.857
No. Absolutely not.

57:34.859 --> 57:35.858
Sort of.

57:35.860 --> 57:37.526
Yeah. See?

57:37.528 --> 57:38.727
Hey, sweetie.
Can I have a Chardonnay?

57:38.729 --> 57:39.861
Yeah.

57:39.863 --> 57:41.863
Traitor, Les.
You're a traitor.

57:41.865 --> 57:43.145
You said it yourself.

57:51.471 --> 57:53.438
Here you go.
Thanks.

57:54.706 --> 57:58.375
I quite like it here.

57:58.377 --> 58:00.877
It's nice. It's cozy.

58:00.879 --> 58:04.080
Oh, I don't know.

58:04.082 --> 58:05.915
No, this isn't
my kind of thing.

58:05.917 --> 58:11.586
It's not my...
Not my style, my... you know...

58:11.588 --> 58:13.921
This place... I'm not, uh...

58:13.923 --> 58:15.889
Hmm.

58:15.891 --> 58:18.725
I can tell I'm, uh...

58:18.727 --> 58:21.928
It's not my style,
you know, not my lifestyle.

58:21.930 --> 58:24.730
I, uh... I can feel it...

58:24.732 --> 58:26.798
Mm.
...Sitting here.

58:26.800 --> 58:27.999
I don't like men.

58:29.469 --> 58:31.068
Ah. And I've lived long enough
to know that.

58:31.070 --> 58:32.102
Mm.

58:35.507 --> 58:36.506
That's good.

58:36.508 --> 58:37.607
Yeah. No. But I don't.

58:37.609 --> 58:38.608
I mean, uh...

58:38.610 --> 58:40.076
Yeah, I really don't.

58:40.078 --> 58:41.777
Mm.

58:41.779 --> 58:44.780
I mean, sure, there are men
that you see from time to time

58:44.782 --> 58:46.915
at certain points and, uh...

58:46.917 --> 58:50.418
I mean, just 'cause I'm a man
doesn't mean that I can't...

58:50.420 --> 58:52.753
I mean,
I see an attractive person,

58:52.755 --> 58:55.589
a guy, and I can say,
"oh, yeah, well...

58:55.591 --> 58:57.424
Well,
he's a good-looking dude."

58:57.426 --> 58:59.426
I think it's okay
to feel that way.

58:59.428 --> 59:02.095
It doesn't mean
you're gay.

59:03.932 --> 59:05.598
That's just someone
being honest,

59:05.600 --> 59:07.800
you know, being...
being open.

59:07.802 --> 59:09.668
And I think that's healthy.

59:09.670 --> 59:11.670
Yeah. Yeah.
That's healthy.

59:11.672 --> 59:13.772
Yeah.
That ever happen to you?

59:13.774 --> 59:14.806
What?

59:14.808 --> 59:16.974
Do you ever see a guy
and...

59:16.976 --> 59:17.975
And what?

59:17.977 --> 59:20.811
Feel something.
Well, yeah.

59:20.813 --> 59:23.046
That that guy's cute,
something like that.

59:23.048 --> 59:24.113
Well, yeah,
I mean, I'm a girl,

59:24.115 --> 59:25.781
and I used to fuck guys,
so...

59:25.783 --> 59:27.649
So, then that
doesn't make you, uh,

59:27.651 --> 59:29.717
whatever that would make you...
Straight.

59:29.719 --> 59:31.785
Okay. I mean, I see
where you're going with it.

59:31.787 --> 59:34.621
Okay. So, it's not a crime
to feel that way.

59:34.623 --> 59:37.457
I mean, I don't sit here
in the corner of this place

59:37.459 --> 59:40.059
and look around and think,
"Oh, man, I-I got to...

59:40.061 --> 59:43.796
I have to kiss a man
or touch his thing,"

59:43.798 --> 59:45.564
or that kind of deal,
you know?

59:45.566 --> 59:47.065
It doesn't even
enter my mind.

59:47.067 --> 59:48.966
Mm.

59:48.968 --> 59:50.801
So, that's really
what I wanted to say to you.

59:50.803 --> 59:52.469
I'm... I'm not gay.

59:52.471 --> 59:53.970
I'm not...

59:53.972 --> 59:56.138
I'm not a gay person.

59:56.140 --> 59:57.506
Okay.
That's all.

59:57.508 --> 59:58.840
That's good, isn't it?

59:58.842 --> 59:59.907
Yes, very good.

59:59.909 --> 01:00:01.174
Good.

01:00:01.176 --> 01:00:02.975
It's good
to get to the bottom of that.

01:00:02.977 --> 01:00:04.576
Yeah.

01:00:04.578 --> 01:00:06.077
Cheers.
Yeah.

01:00:06.079 --> 01:00:08.212
I think it's very good
that we came here...

01:00:08.214 --> 01:00:10.814
Mm.
...To prove that.

01:00:10.816 --> 01:00:12.715
I think it was worth it.

01:00:12.717 --> 01:00:15.184
I'm gonna use the toilet,
and then I think we should,

01:00:15.186 --> 01:00:17.119
uh... we should go.

01:00:20.522 --> 01:00:21.522
Les.

01:00:21.524 --> 01:00:23.657
Hmm?

01:00:23.659 --> 01:00:25.592
Be careful in there.

01:00:56.882 --> 01:00:58.749
You a Lakers fan?

01:01:04.255 --> 01:01:07.857
Maybe they can turn the channel
on one of those TVS.

01:01:07.859 --> 01:01:10.259
We can watch
the end of the game.

01:02:15.112 --> 01:02:16.712
No, no, no, no.
It's just like...

01:02:17.914 --> 01:02:20.114
...this dude and me all day.

01:02:20.116 --> 01:02:21.849
Wow. All day?

01:02:21.851 --> 01:02:23.851
Yeah, all day.

01:02:23.853 --> 01:02:26.320
Hey, uh...

01:02:26.322 --> 01:02:27.688
You ready?

01:02:27.690 --> 01:02:28.755
Yeah.
I just moved over here.

01:02:28.757 --> 01:02:29.956
Just give me one minute.

01:02:29.958 --> 01:02:31.023
Yeah. Sure.

01:02:31.025 --> 01:02:32.157
Hello there.

01:02:32.159 --> 01:02:34.658
Hey.

01:02:36.794 --> 01:02:38.594
We were just talking.

01:02:38.596 --> 01:02:41.096
Yes. Yes. Obviously.

01:02:41.098 --> 01:02:43.131
Les,
I'll see you outside.

01:02:43.133 --> 01:02:44.832
Right. Okay.

01:02:44.834 --> 01:02:48.602
I'm gonna go, um,
make a phone call or something.

01:02:48.604 --> 01:02:52.939
He's my work colleague.

01:02:52.941 --> 01:02:54.640
And you brought him here.

01:02:54.642 --> 01:02:55.941
I did bring him here.

01:02:55.943 --> 01:02:57.776
Why are you toying with...

01:03:17.963 --> 01:03:19.129
Hey, sweetie.

01:03:19.131 --> 01:03:20.130
Can I have a Manhattan,
please?

01:03:20.132 --> 01:03:21.431
You got it.

01:03:41.884 --> 01:03:43.150
May I?

01:03:43.152 --> 01:03:44.252
Depends.

01:03:44.254 --> 01:03:45.419
On what?

01:03:45.421 --> 01:03:47.520
Let me
take a look at you first.

01:03:49.923 --> 01:03:51.924
You can sit.

01:03:51.926 --> 01:03:52.958
Thank you.

01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:54.125
I had nothing
to do with it.

01:03:54.127 --> 01:03:55.126
Oh, really?

01:03:55.128 --> 01:03:56.260
No. That was all you.

01:03:56.262 --> 01:03:57.327
You passed the test.

01:03:57.329 --> 01:03:58.494
And what test is that?

01:03:58.496 --> 01:03:59.928
The sitting-down test.

01:03:59.930 --> 01:04:01.496
Trust me...
Not everybody does.

01:04:01.498 --> 01:04:03.431
Oh. Well, then I...
I feel very...

01:04:03.433 --> 01:04:05.166
You passed it
last time, too.

01:04:05.168 --> 01:04:06.467
I did?

01:04:06.469 --> 01:04:08.135
You did, indeed.

01:04:08.137 --> 01:04:10.971
Well, I'm not a local,
you know.

01:04:10.973 --> 01:04:15.041
I mean, uh, this isn't my...
I-I-I-I don't come here often.

01:04:15.043 --> 01:04:16.208
I know.

01:04:16.210 --> 01:04:18.176
Okay.

01:04:18.178 --> 01:04:21.511
But it's not your first time
here, either, now, is it?

01:04:21.513 --> 01:04:23.045
Um...

01:04:23.047 --> 01:04:24.846
I think we've met before.

01:04:24.848 --> 01:04:25.980
Yeah?

01:04:25.982 --> 01:04:27.848
You sure?

01:04:27.850 --> 01:04:29.449
Almost 100%.

01:04:29.451 --> 01:04:31.117
Almost?

01:04:31.119 --> 01:04:33.953
Well, if there wasn't a little
bit of mystery in life,

01:04:33.955 --> 01:04:36.789
then it just wouldn't be
worth living, now, would it?

01:04:36.791 --> 01:04:37.990
Yeah.

01:04:37.992 --> 01:04:39.391
I suppose that's true.

01:04:39.393 --> 01:04:42.026
No. I am pretty sure
we've met before,

01:04:42.028 --> 01:04:45.962
if not here, then somewhere else
at some point.

01:04:45.964 --> 01:04:48.297
Yeah.

01:04:48.299 --> 01:04:50.539
Yeah,
I feel that way, too.

01:04:51.567 --> 01:04:54.468
But I was seeing if you would
remember it because...

01:04:54.470 --> 01:04:56.837
Because I think was a bit...

01:04:56.839 --> 01:04:59.239
I was very drunk
when it happened, so...

01:04:59.241 --> 01:05:00.473
I remember.

01:05:00.475 --> 01:05:01.474
Really?

01:05:01.476 --> 01:05:02.508
I do, yes.

01:05:02.510 --> 01:05:04.409
You were very drunk,
in fact.

01:05:04.411 --> 01:05:05.877
Really?
Quite.

01:05:05.879 --> 01:05:07.979
I practically
had to carry you out of here.

01:05:07.981 --> 01:05:11.482
Oh. So, we did leave here
together?

01:05:11.484 --> 01:05:13.417
We absolutely did.

01:05:13.419 --> 01:05:15.152
Huh.

01:05:16.988 --> 01:05:19.089
You want me to show you
where we went?

01:05:19.091 --> 01:05:21.825
It's not far from here.
Promise.

01:05:26.529 --> 01:05:27.569
Sorry.

01:05:28.832 --> 01:05:30.031
Oh, it's the office.

01:05:30.033 --> 01:05:31.832
No problem.

01:05:31.834 --> 01:05:34.367
So?

01:05:34.369 --> 01:05:35.835
Uh...

01:05:35.837 --> 01:05:37.870
It's up to you.
I mean, it was up to me,

01:05:37.872 --> 01:05:40.271
but I've now turned it over
to you, so...

01:05:42.207 --> 01:05:43.840
Yes.

01:05:43.842 --> 01:05:45.074
Yes?

01:05:45.076 --> 01:05:48.177
Yes. Please... miss.

01:05:48.179 --> 01:05:49.945
"Please" is nice.

01:05:49.947 --> 01:05:51.513
I like "please."

01:05:51.515 --> 01:05:53.915
Shall we?

01:06:01.022 --> 01:06:02.422
Oh, you know what?

01:06:02.424 --> 01:06:05.591
I-I came here with someone...
My work partner.

01:06:05.593 --> 01:06:07.292
It's a... it's a woman.

01:06:07.294 --> 01:06:09.027
It's... it's not a man.

01:06:09.029 --> 01:06:10.862
It's not a, uh...
Not a gay man.

01:06:10.864 --> 01:06:12.430
Uh, I'll be back
in a minute.

01:06:12.432 --> 01:06:13.431
I'll be waiting.

01:06:13.433 --> 01:06:15.299
All right.

01:06:20.537 --> 01:06:24.673
Uh... glad you two
could finally break the ice.

01:06:27.076 --> 01:06:28.376
Can you give us
another second?

01:06:28.378 --> 01:06:29.944
Yeah, sure.

01:06:29.946 --> 01:06:31.045
Uh, actually,
there's no rush.

01:06:31.047 --> 01:06:34.448
I, um... I found the, uh...

01:06:34.450 --> 01:06:35.449
Look...
Look over there.

01:06:35.451 --> 01:06:37.317
Is that her?

01:06:37.319 --> 01:06:38.484
Yeah. Yeah.

01:06:38.486 --> 01:06:40.886
As best
I can remember, it is.

01:06:40.888 --> 01:06:43.221
Wow. She's young.

01:06:43.223 --> 01:06:44.488
Yeah, pretty much.

01:06:44.490 --> 01:06:46.456
And she's a she.
Isn't she a she?

01:06:46.458 --> 01:06:47.457
She is.

01:06:47.459 --> 01:06:48.558
She's a she.

01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:49.992
I lost the bet.

01:06:49.994 --> 01:06:52.160
Yeah.
Well, let's call it even.

01:06:52.162 --> 01:06:55.596
We had this bet where he had...
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

01:06:55.598 --> 01:06:57.130
Are you gonna go?
Yeah.

01:06:57.132 --> 01:07:00.399
Yeah, just for a quick...
Quickie talk.

01:07:00.401 --> 01:07:01.400
Are you sure?

01:07:01.402 --> 01:07:03.135
Yeah.

01:07:03.137 --> 01:07:05.303
Yeah.

01:07:07.272 --> 01:07:11.174
Hey, this turned out to be
one crazy layover, right?

01:07:11.176 --> 01:07:13.943
Yeah.
A dirty weekend.

01:07:13.945 --> 01:07:15.511
Right.
Jesus.

01:07:15.513 --> 01:07:17.145
Uh, keep your phone on.

01:07:17.147 --> 01:07:18.446
I'll be here, I think.

01:07:18.448 --> 01:07:20.414
Okay.

01:07:27.020 --> 01:07:28.086
Sorry.

01:07:28.088 --> 01:07:29.187
No problem.

01:07:29.189 --> 01:07:30.188
I'm used to waiting.

01:07:30.190 --> 01:07:31.355
I do it for a living.

01:07:31.357 --> 01:07:33.156
Oh, really?
What's that mean?

01:07:33.158 --> 01:07:35.091
You know what I mean.

01:07:35.093 --> 01:07:36.325
Yeah. I guess.

01:07:36.327 --> 01:07:37.526
I think.

01:07:37.528 --> 01:07:39.594
Come on, Tiger.
Let's get going.

01:07:39.596 --> 01:07:41.963
We've only got so much time,
right?

01:07:41.965 --> 01:07:43.597
Uh, yeah.
I have a flight.

01:07:43.599 --> 01:07:45.498
Oh, uh,
you mean you and me?

01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:47.333
You and me only have
so much time?

01:07:47.335 --> 01:07:48.600
Oh, we all do.

01:07:48.602 --> 01:07:50.935
Everybody's only got
so much time, baby,

01:07:50.937 --> 01:07:53.337
and life is keeping tabs.

01:08:13.122 --> 01:08:15.323
Do you want ice?

01:08:15.325 --> 01:08:17.491
Uh, no. I'm fine.

01:08:17.493 --> 01:08:19.392
Just straight.

01:08:19.394 --> 01:08:20.393
Or neat.

01:08:20.395 --> 01:08:22.528
Well,
whatever you call it.

01:08:22.529 --> 01:08:24.062
I like that... "Neat."

01:08:24.064 --> 01:08:25.363
Yeah.

01:08:25.365 --> 01:08:26.464
I like it, too.

01:08:28.133 --> 01:08:30.033
So, how about you?

01:08:30.035 --> 01:08:32.001
How do you like it?

01:08:32.002 --> 01:08:33.167
Rocks.

01:08:42.076 --> 01:08:43.508
You can make a call
if you need to.

01:08:43.510 --> 01:08:44.575
Oh, no, no.

01:08:44.577 --> 01:08:45.576
I'm good.

01:08:45.578 --> 01:08:47.310
You sure?
Yeah. Yeah.

01:08:47.313 --> 01:08:48.377
It's all fine.

01:08:48.380 --> 01:08:49.679
Great.

01:08:51.049 --> 01:08:52.314
It's just us, then.

01:08:52.316 --> 01:08:54.549
Yeah. Exactly.

01:08:55.484 --> 01:08:56.716
That's nice.

01:08:56.719 --> 01:08:58.185
I like that.

01:08:58.187 --> 01:09:00.353
Thank you.

01:09:00.354 --> 01:09:03.421
So, uh, did we come here
last time?

01:09:03.424 --> 01:09:05.490
Uh, we did, yeah.

01:09:05.492 --> 01:09:07.258
I don't remember
this place.

01:09:07.260 --> 01:09:09.093
Still, we did.

01:09:09.095 --> 01:09:10.594
Okay.

01:09:10.595 --> 01:09:13.196
And, um, did we...?

01:09:13.198 --> 01:09:14.729
What?

01:09:14.732 --> 01:09:16.531
Nothing.

01:09:16.533 --> 01:09:18.032
No. Go ahead.

01:09:18.033 --> 01:09:20.734
Well, I-I've just been
thinking about this

01:09:20.736 --> 01:09:23.036
for a few months,
and I'm...

01:09:23.037 --> 01:09:25.337
A-and I'm trying to remember
the... the details.

01:09:25.340 --> 01:09:29.008
And I... well, I-I don't mean
that you're forgettable.

01:09:30.111 --> 01:09:31.577
Don't worry.
I'm not offended.

01:09:31.578 --> 01:09:33.612
Good. Good.
I don't mean to be rude.

01:09:33.613 --> 01:09:39.082
I-I just wanted to...
To ask if you...

01:09:39.085 --> 01:09:41.318
You see, it doesn't
all add up in my head.

01:09:42.386 --> 01:09:44.053
How is that?

01:09:44.055 --> 01:09:45.520
Well,
when this first happened

01:09:45.523 --> 01:09:48.290
however many months ago,
and I...

01:09:48.292 --> 01:09:53.359
I met you at Zorro and...

01:09:53.362 --> 01:09:55.261
A place that I somehow
went into with...

01:09:55.263 --> 01:09:57.096
"Somehow"?

01:09:57.098 --> 01:09:59.465
Well, I had no idea
that that was a gay bar,

01:09:59.467 --> 01:10:00.766
I mean, absolutely none.

01:10:00.768 --> 01:10:02.567
Okay.

01:10:02.569 --> 01:10:06.137
And then I met you,
and that... that was great.

01:10:06.139 --> 01:10:09.707
But it doesn't make any...

01:10:09.709 --> 01:10:11.709
I mean,
why were you there?

01:10:11.711 --> 01:10:13.210
I-I don't follow.

01:10:13.212 --> 01:10:16.146
I inadvertently go into a place
like that,

01:10:16.148 --> 01:10:18.414
and still I somehow
end up meeting

01:10:18.416 --> 01:10:20.382
a beautiful girl like you?

01:10:22.451 --> 01:10:23.551
I don't get it.

01:10:23.553 --> 01:10:25.586
Oh, I see.

01:10:25.588 --> 01:10:27.355
Well, that's easy.

01:10:27.357 --> 01:10:29.824
I was there
with my brother.

01:10:29.826 --> 01:10:32.493
Oh.
Oh, all right.

01:10:32.495 --> 01:10:33.861
Yeah.
He likes to hang out there.

01:10:33.863 --> 01:10:35.162
We both do.

01:10:35.164 --> 01:10:37.330
It's quiet.
It's close.

01:10:37.332 --> 01:10:38.664
Got it.

01:10:38.666 --> 01:10:41.366
So, we were there
and you came over

01:10:41.368 --> 01:10:45.369
and started talking to us
and that's how these things go.

01:10:45.371 --> 01:10:47.738
One thing just leads
to another.

01:10:47.740 --> 01:10:49.406
Huh.

01:10:49.408 --> 01:10:51.441
Wow.

01:10:51.443 --> 01:10:54.243
A-And I just started
hitting on you right there?

01:10:54.245 --> 01:10:56.244
Mm-hmm.

01:10:57.913 --> 01:10:59.179
Jesus.

01:10:59.181 --> 01:11:00.346
In front of him?

01:11:00.348 --> 01:11:02.915
You were
quite persistent.

01:11:02.917 --> 01:11:05.183
Oh. Wow.

01:11:06.286 --> 01:11:09.887
It's, uh,
shoulder surgery.

01:11:09.889 --> 01:11:12.256
That's fine.

01:11:12.258 --> 01:11:15.726
Anyway, married guys are usually
that way... persistent.

01:11:15.728 --> 01:11:17.527
Oh, yeah?
Is that right?

01:11:17.529 --> 01:11:20.863
Yeah. You didn't have that on
last time.

01:11:20.865 --> 01:11:23.232
Oh. Sorry.

01:11:23.234 --> 01:11:25.467
Oh, I di... I didn't mean
to embarrass you.

01:11:25.469 --> 01:11:27.235
No, I'm...
I'm sure I made it

01:11:27.237 --> 01:11:29.237
pretty obvious anyway,
right?

01:11:29.239 --> 01:11:30.871
Pretty much, yeah.

01:11:33.808 --> 01:11:34.908
But if...

01:11:34.910 --> 01:11:36.209
Nothing.

01:11:36.211 --> 01:11:37.877
It doesn't matter to me.

01:11:37.879 --> 01:11:39.879
It's your business.

01:11:39.881 --> 01:11:43.215
It had very little to do
with our business.

01:11:43.217 --> 01:11:44.282
Our business?

01:11:44.284 --> 01:11:45.950
Yours, mine, ours,

01:11:45.952 --> 01:11:49.719
our business,
the business at hand.

01:11:49.721 --> 01:11:51.220
I don't follow you.

01:11:51.222 --> 01:11:52.554
Yes, you do.

01:11:52.556 --> 01:11:54.455
But I mean... wait.

01:11:54.457 --> 01:11:55.656
What's your name?

01:11:55.658 --> 01:11:59.559
That, actually,
isn't your business.

01:11:59.561 --> 01:12:01.327
And your name
isn't my business,

01:12:01.329 --> 01:12:05.464
so let's just stick to business,
all right?

01:12:05.466 --> 01:12:07.332
It's easier that way.

01:12:07.334 --> 01:12:09.767
Sure.

01:12:09.769 --> 01:12:12.636
So, what's it gonna be
today?

01:12:12.638 --> 01:12:13.803
Hmm?

01:12:13.805 --> 01:12:15.638
I'm just asking
what you want.

01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:17.239
The price is the same.

01:12:17.241 --> 01:12:21.008
I mean,
unless you decide on some new...

01:12:25.314 --> 01:12:26.446
Hi.

01:12:27.749 --> 01:12:28.748
Hi there.

01:12:28.750 --> 01:12:29.815
How are you?

01:12:29.817 --> 01:12:32.584
Mmm!
Thanks for hurrying back.

01:12:32.586 --> 01:12:33.618
Oh, yeah.

01:12:33.620 --> 01:12:35.953
I let him know
you were here

01:12:35.955 --> 01:12:38.922
so we could all be together
again.

01:12:38.924 --> 01:12:39.923
Sorry?

01:12:39.925 --> 01:12:41.424
I just... I figured

01:12:41.426 --> 01:12:43.259
you wanted this to be
like the last time,

01:12:43.261 --> 01:12:46.428
with the two of us...
At least, to start.

01:12:46.430 --> 01:12:47.629
I don't follow you.

01:12:47.631 --> 01:12:49.764
Last time, here,
the three of us.

01:12:49.766 --> 01:12:53.267
That's what you wanted before,
so I... I just figured...

01:12:53.269 --> 01:12:54.868
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

01:12:54.870 --> 01:12:57.437
You mean... y-you mean
the three of us were...

01:12:57.439 --> 01:12:59.472
Were together,
like a group?

01:12:59.474 --> 01:13:01.774
Well,
not the whole night, but...

01:13:01.776 --> 01:13:03.842
I mean, we switched off
a couple of times.

01:13:03.844 --> 01:13:05.276
Yeah.

01:13:05.278 --> 01:13:06.977
I-I'm sorry.
Uh, help me out here.

01:13:06.979 --> 01:13:09.346
You mean...
You mean this is your brother?

01:13:09.348 --> 01:13:12.515
Yeah. He's my brother.
We live here together.

01:13:12.517 --> 01:13:13.849
We're roommates.

01:13:13.851 --> 01:13:15.350
Oh, yeah?

01:13:15.352 --> 01:13:16.884
How... how many bedrooms
do you have here?

01:13:16.886 --> 01:13:18.652
Just the one.

01:13:18.654 --> 01:13:20.086
Oh.

01:13:21.955 --> 01:13:23.455
Does this...

01:13:27.392 --> 01:13:28.625
Wait.

01:13:28.627 --> 01:13:31.728
You don't remember
all of the...?

01:13:31.730 --> 01:13:33.362
Well, kind of.

01:13:34.365 --> 01:13:35.964
Vaguely.
"Vaguely"?

01:13:35.966 --> 01:13:38.366
Yeah, but I...

01:13:38.368 --> 01:13:40.301
Well, no, I-
I could swear

01:13:40.303 --> 01:13:42.036
I was with a woman, I think.

01:13:42.038 --> 01:13:44.872
I dress up, you know,
when... when we go out.

01:13:44.874 --> 01:13:46.340
You do?

01:13:46.342 --> 01:13:48.642
You mean for...?

01:13:48.644 --> 01:13:50.310
Uh-huh.

01:13:50.312 --> 01:13:52.011
But I mean...

01:13:52.013 --> 01:13:55.481
You mean as a lady.

01:13:55.483 --> 01:13:57.649
But I thought...

01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:03.054
I think
I was with a woman.

01:14:03.056 --> 01:14:06.323
But you're not sure,
right?

01:14:06.325 --> 01:14:07.691
A little bit.

01:14:07.693 --> 01:14:11.661
Well, I-I-I remember a...
A feeling of, um...

01:14:11.663 --> 01:14:12.862
Well, you know.

01:14:12.864 --> 01:14:16.431
What? Of <i> this?</i>

01:14:17.933 --> 01:14:19.833
No, it was just...

01:14:19.835 --> 01:14:22.836
Something different...
The <i> way</i> we made love.

01:14:24.439 --> 01:14:25.838
But that had to be you,
right?

01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:27.072
Wasn't it?

01:14:27.074 --> 01:14:28.073
Was it?

01:14:28.075 --> 01:14:30.675
Well, it must have been.

01:14:30.677 --> 01:14:34.512
I-I mean, no offense,
but I'm not a...

01:14:34.514 --> 01:14:36.447
I mean, I'm not...
I'm not that kind of guy.

01:14:36.449 --> 01:14:38.081
I'm just not.

01:14:38.083 --> 01:14:39.082
You know.

01:14:39.084 --> 01:14:40.750
I've never been with a...

01:14:40.752 --> 01:14:44.353
Oh, but you went back
to Zorro, right?

01:14:44.355 --> 01:14:45.687
I mean, today.

01:14:45.689 --> 01:14:47.088
Yeah.

01:14:47.090 --> 01:14:49.456
Yeah, that's true.

01:14:52.359 --> 01:14:55.561
This is...
Did you give me this?

01:14:55.563 --> 01:14:57.796
No, not me.

01:14:57.798 --> 01:15:00.497
Hey, isn't this
your handwriting?

01:15:02.533 --> 01:15:05.568
Mm-hmm. Yep.

01:15:05.570 --> 01:15:07.570
I wrote that.

01:15:07.572 --> 01:15:09.705
Oh, I see.

01:15:09.707 --> 01:15:13.641
So... so, did we, um...

01:15:15.478 --> 01:15:19.479
You did a bunch of stuff
with both of us...

01:15:19.481 --> 01:15:20.780
A lot...

01:15:20.782 --> 01:15:22.114
Of things.

01:15:22.116 --> 01:15:23.982
Oh.

01:15:23.984 --> 01:15:26.116
Oh, God.

01:15:29.888 --> 01:15:33.389
Is <i> that</i> why
you came back here?

01:15:33.391 --> 01:15:38.960
I've been... well, I was...
I was very drunk.

01:15:38.962 --> 01:15:40.761
And I didn't know if...
If... if...

01:15:40.763 --> 01:15:44.564
If you were with me
or someone else?

01:15:44.566 --> 01:15:45.898
Yeah.

01:15:45.900 --> 01:15:47.799
Does it <i> really</i> matter
who it's with,

01:15:47.801 --> 01:15:50.067
as long as
they're doing this?

01:15:50.069 --> 01:15:51.401
Well, kind of.

01:15:51.403 --> 01:15:52.902
Uh.

01:15:52.904 --> 01:15:56.064
You know this feels good, doesn't it?
Hey.

01:15:56.573 --> 01:15:58.639
Okay.

01:15:58.641 --> 01:16:01.642
Ah. Hey, wait. Wait.
Wait. Wait. Wait.

01:16:02.645 --> 01:16:04.711
God. Wait.

01:16:06.914 --> 01:16:09.749
Hang on.

01:16:09.751 --> 01:16:11.483
Huh?

01:17:06.798 --> 01:17:08.964
Hey there.

01:17:08.966 --> 01:17:11.032
Hmm? No, yeah.

01:17:11.034 --> 01:17:13.067
No, I'm close.

01:17:13.069 --> 01:17:15.002
Oh, you did?

01:17:15.004 --> 01:17:18.138
Okay, but are you sure?

01:17:18.140 --> 01:17:21.007
Yeah,
but are you sure, sure?

01:17:21.009 --> 01:17:23.743
Oh, w-well, good.
We should take that.

01:17:23.745 --> 01:17:25.845
Yeah, yeah,
I can be there in a few.

01:17:25.847 --> 01:17:28.079
Yeah, I-I can be there
in like, uh...

01:17:29.848 --> 01:17:32.082
Okay. Yeah.

01:17:32.084 --> 01:17:34.818
Okay. I'll see you then.

01:17:34.820 --> 01:17:38.220
Right. Good. Bye.

01:17:40.590 --> 01:17:41.655
You taking off?

01:17:41.657 --> 01:17:43.157
Yeah.

01:17:43.159 --> 01:17:45.759
Looks like there's an opening
in the storm and...

01:17:45.761 --> 01:17:47.761
That's okay.
I understand.

01:17:47.763 --> 01:17:50.797
Thank you.

01:17:50.799 --> 01:17:52.331
You're welcome to stay,
though.

01:17:52.333 --> 01:17:56.768
Oh, that's...
That's very nice of you.

01:17:56.770 --> 01:18:00.771
Thank you, but, uh, I think
we ought to get to Dallas.

01:18:00.773 --> 01:18:02.973
No. I mean
if you can't get out,

01:18:02.975 --> 01:18:04.641
if you go to the airport

01:18:04.643 --> 01:18:07.276
and you find
that your flight doesn't go,

01:18:07.278 --> 01:18:09.211
you're welcome to come back
and stay.

01:18:09.213 --> 01:18:10.712
Oh. Oh, I see.

01:18:10.714 --> 01:18:13.881
Well, that's...
Thank you.

01:18:15.350 --> 01:18:16.983
Is that
where you're from?

01:18:16.985 --> 01:18:18.651
Hmm? Um, no.

01:18:18.653 --> 01:18:20.686
No, it's a business thing.

01:18:20.688 --> 01:18:22.821
Oh, I see.

01:18:22.823 --> 01:18:24.122
Yep.

01:18:24.124 --> 01:18:27.024
We're from Oregon
originally... F.Y.I.

01:18:27.026 --> 01:18:28.225
Oh.

01:18:28.227 --> 01:18:30.727
Oh, yeah.
That's a nice town.

01:18:30.729 --> 01:18:31.961
I mean city.

01:18:33.197 --> 01:18:34.696
I mean state.

01:18:34.698 --> 01:18:36.631
Good. Northwest.

01:18:36.633 --> 01:18:38.065
Very good.

01:18:38.067 --> 01:18:40.901
Yeah. Me and my brother...
We ended up here...

01:18:40.903 --> 01:18:42.235
"Albu-Quirky."

01:18:42.237 --> 01:18:44.670
But that's where we're from...
Portland.

01:18:44.672 --> 01:18:47.072
Cool.

01:18:50.675 --> 01:18:52.242
Um...

01:18:52.244 --> 01:18:55.044
Well, it was...
It was good to see you again.

01:18:55.046 --> 01:18:57.846
Yeah. Yeah, it was good
to see you, too.

01:18:57.848 --> 01:18:59.080
Yeah?

01:18:59.082 --> 01:19:00.881
Yeah. Absolutely.

01:19:00.883 --> 01:19:02.448
That was, uh...

01:19:05.251 --> 01:19:07.819
We don't have to wake him up,
do we?

01:19:07.821 --> 01:19:09.053
No. That's okay.

01:19:09.055 --> 01:19:10.721
I'll tell him
you said goodbye.

01:19:10.723 --> 01:19:12.389
Thanks.

01:19:19.229 --> 01:19:20.395
Oh, no, no, no, no.

01:19:20.397 --> 01:19:22.163
Tonight wasn't for money.

01:19:22.165 --> 01:19:23.697
It was just for fun.

01:19:23.699 --> 01:19:25.098
We do that sometimes.

01:19:25.100 --> 01:19:27.100
We...
We like to have fun.

01:19:27.102 --> 01:19:29.735
You should give it a try
sometime.

01:19:33.772 --> 01:19:36.039
I hope this answered
some of your questions.

01:19:36.041 --> 01:19:38.274
I think so.

01:19:38.276 --> 01:19:40.843
Or not.

01:19:40.845 --> 01:19:42.845
Hell, I don't know.

01:19:42.847 --> 01:19:44.112
I'm just...

01:19:44.114 --> 01:19:46.280
Well, here. Here.

01:19:50.418 --> 01:19:52.752
This is my number.

01:20:00.893 --> 01:20:03.213
In case anything else
comes up.

01:20:03.863 --> 01:20:05.295
No.

01:20:05.297 --> 01:20:07.263
Thank you, but...

01:20:07.265 --> 01:20:09.031
You know what?

01:20:09.033 --> 01:20:10.232
You keep it.

01:20:10.234 --> 01:20:12.367
I think
I need to find other ways

01:20:12.369 --> 01:20:14.702
of figuring out things
in my life.

01:20:14.704 --> 01:20:17.738
And I'm a little mature
to start searching now.

01:20:17.740 --> 01:20:20.741
Okay, well, good luck.

01:20:20.743 --> 01:20:22.342
Thank you.

01:20:23.377 --> 01:20:25.311
Just so you know,
most people I meet

01:20:25.313 --> 01:20:27.112
are searching for something,

01:20:27.114 --> 01:20:30.081
so at least
you wouldn't be alone.

01:20:30.083 --> 01:20:33.317
Hmm. See?

01:20:33.319 --> 01:20:36.153
I knew something good
would come out of this.

01:20:36.155 --> 01:20:38.255
Let me help you.

01:20:38.257 --> 01:20:40.023
Thank you.

01:20:43.293 --> 01:20:44.926
He really is pretty

01:20:44.928 --> 01:20:47.728
when he's all, you know,
done up.

01:20:47.730 --> 01:20:48.829
Yeah?

01:20:48.831 --> 01:20:50.230
Very attractive.

01:20:50.232 --> 01:20:51.965
And better legs
than even me.

01:20:51.967 --> 01:20:53.333
Bastard.

01:20:59.739 --> 01:21:03.741
Hey, let me ask you this
before I leave.

01:21:03.743 --> 01:21:08.411
When we first met,
did he have an outfit on?

01:21:08.413 --> 01:21:10.913
I mean, he said
he liked to dress up, so...

01:21:10.915 --> 01:21:13.248
Yeah, he did.

01:21:13.250 --> 01:21:14.949
That's what we look like
when we go out.

01:21:14.951 --> 01:21:18.018
Oh.

01:21:18.020 --> 01:21:19.786
Oh, so, at the time,

01:21:19.788 --> 01:21:22.922
Wh-when I came over
to you guys, I...

01:21:22.924 --> 01:21:25.357
I thought it was probably
just... just two women.

01:21:25.359 --> 01:21:26.458
Is that how it was?

01:21:26.460 --> 01:21:28.993
Well, I don't...
I don't know.

01:21:28.995 --> 01:21:30.928
I'm just curious.

01:21:30.930 --> 01:21:34.298
I have no idea
why you came over

01:21:34.300 --> 01:21:38.168
or what you were thinking
or... or looking for,

01:21:38.170 --> 01:21:41.104
how much you knew
or didn't know.

01:21:41.106 --> 01:21:42.805
Only you know that.

01:21:42.807 --> 01:21:44.206
I suppose that's true.

01:21:44.208 --> 01:21:46.942
It's inside of you,
the answer to that.

01:21:46.944 --> 01:21:48.209
Got it.

01:21:48.211 --> 01:21:50.110
Okay, then.

01:21:55.949 --> 01:21:57.182
I'll see you around.

01:21:57.184 --> 01:21:59.817
Well, probably not, but...

01:21:59.819 --> 01:22:01.351
You never know.

01:22:01.353 --> 01:22:04.821
That's true.
You never do.

01:22:04.823 --> 01:22:07.456
Hey, do you happen to have
a, uh, car or something?

01:22:07.458 --> 01:22:08.990
'Cause I'm terribly late.

01:22:08.992 --> 01:22:10.858
Sorry.
I don't believe in cars.

01:22:10.860 --> 01:22:13.060
They ruin the environment.

01:22:13.062 --> 01:22:15.462
Oh. Right.
Okay.

01:22:15.464 --> 01:22:18.131
You can take my brother's
scooter if you want.

01:22:18.133 --> 01:22:20.299
Just leave it at Zorro.

01:22:20.301 --> 01:22:22.567
Yeah?

01:22:28.306 --> 01:22:31.007
I'm from Pasadena.

01:22:31.009 --> 01:22:32.475
My family and I live

01:22:32.477 --> 01:22:35.411
right outside
of Los Angeles, F.Y.I.

01:23:32.030 --> 01:23:33.530
I can't believe
we actually managed

01:23:33.532 --> 01:23:35.198
to find
a different taxi driver.

01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:36.365
I know.

01:23:36.367 --> 01:23:38.934
Mr. Shakespeare guy.

01:23:42.905 --> 01:23:44.872
You doing okay?

01:23:44.874 --> 01:23:46.540
Yeah.

01:23:46.542 --> 01:23:48.241
You?

01:23:48.243 --> 01:23:50.876
I don't know.

01:23:50.878 --> 01:23:53.545
I have no idea.

01:23:53.547 --> 01:23:55.947
Okay.

01:23:55.949 --> 01:23:58.482
I got it.

01:23:58.484 --> 01:24:01.885
Who was that girl
you were talking to?

01:24:01.887 --> 01:24:03.987
Can't remember her name.

01:24:53.002 --> 01:24:54.035
Hey.

01:24:54.037 --> 01:24:56.103
All right.

01:24:57.106 --> 01:24:58.472
Shakespeare.

01:24:58.474 --> 01:25:01.040
Shakespeare, Shakespeare, eh?

01:25:02.475 --> 01:25:04.708
Oh...

01:25:07.645 --> 01:25:10.179
Dude.

01:25:21.624 --> 01:25:24.125
We still have
a few minutes, right?

01:25:24.127 --> 01:25:26.026
A bit.

01:25:26.028 --> 01:25:30.296
Got to make a call.

01:25:32.466 --> 01:25:34.732
Can I borrow yours?

01:25:40.137 --> 01:25:42.404
Don't get lost.

01:26:03.592 --> 01:26:05.025
Hi.

01:26:05.027 --> 01:26:07.160
Well, you know. It's me.

01:26:07.162 --> 01:26:09.096
Hi.

01:26:09.098 --> 01:26:12.532
Hey there, sweetie.

01:26:12.534 --> 01:26:13.766
Mm-hmm.

01:26:13.768 --> 01:26:15.501
Oh, no, it's just...

01:26:15.503 --> 01:26:20.438
It's just I had to borrow
Miss Havington's phone again.

01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:23.274
Yeah.
I don't get it, either.

01:26:23.276 --> 01:26:26.543
Yeah, I'll check it out
as soon as I get home.

01:26:26.545 --> 01:26:29.379
No. I promise.

01:26:29.381 --> 01:26:31.381
I know.

01:26:31.383 --> 01:26:33.649
I know.

01:26:33.651 --> 01:26:37.619
Yeah,
I'm always promising stuff.

01:26:37.621 --> 01:26:40.121
I know,
but I will this time.

01:26:40.123 --> 01:26:42.456
I will, sweetie.

01:26:42.458 --> 01:26:44.191
I promise you.

01:26:47.295 --> 01:26:50.630
No, I'm just... I'm, uh...

01:26:50.632 --> 01:26:51.797
I-I'm a little tired.

01:26:51.799 --> 01:26:54.132
I'm, um...

01:26:54.134 --> 01:26:55.199
I'm...

01:26:58.637 --> 01:27:02.505
I'm fine.

01:27:02.507 --> 01:27:05.808
No, I'm tired of all the, uh...
The travel, you know?

01:27:05.810 --> 01:27:07.843
I think...

01:27:07.845 --> 01:27:13.181
I-I think I might ask
for a more permanent position.

01:27:13.183 --> 01:27:14.515
Yeah. Yeah.

01:27:14.517 --> 01:27:17.818
The home office
or something like that.

01:27:19.154 --> 01:27:21.821
Yeah, I'd like that.

01:27:21.823 --> 01:27:25.257
Yeah, I'm ready for it.

01:27:25.259 --> 01:27:28.193
Mm-hmm.

01:27:28.195 --> 01:27:30.828
Yeah.

01:27:49.210 --> 01:27:50.376
Hey.

01:27:50.378 --> 01:27:52.678
You get what you need?
Yeah. Yeah.

01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:55.681
Just some stuff, you know,
and a few, uh...

01:27:55.683 --> 01:27:56.848
Trinkets.

01:27:56.850 --> 01:27:59.283
Yeah.

01:27:59.285 --> 01:28:00.717
Go on, then.
Put it on.

01:28:00.719 --> 01:28:01.751
Hmm?

01:28:01.753 --> 01:28:03.853
Put it on.

01:28:14.597 --> 01:28:15.930
Ow.

01:28:17.700 --> 01:28:19.633
<i>This is the final
boarding call to Dallas...</i>

01:28:19.635 --> 01:28:21.401
Wow.

01:28:23.371 --> 01:28:24.370
It's good.

01:28:24.372 --> 01:28:26.472
Wow.

01:28:30.276 --> 01:28:32.910
Anyway...

01:28:35.381 --> 01:28:39.749
I, uh... I appreciate
what you did today...

01:28:39.751 --> 01:28:43.719
All of it, everything.

01:28:43.721 --> 01:28:45.954
Thanks, butch.

01:28:45.956 --> 01:28:49.290
You're welcome,
Sundance.

01:28:56.898 --> 01:28:59.258
Why don't you
take that off?

01:29:00.801 --> 01:29:02.968
Should I?
Yeah.

01:29:02.970 --> 01:29:04.736
Are you sure?
Yeah, for a bit.

01:29:04.738 --> 01:29:07.405
Here. You want me
to help you with it?

01:29:16.746 --> 01:29:18.346
There you are.

01:29:18.348 --> 01:29:20.247
You can always put it back on
if you want to.

01:29:20.249 --> 01:29:21.514
Yeah. Just let it breathe
for a minute.

01:29:21.516 --> 01:29:23.549
Yeah.

01:29:27.653 --> 01:29:29.620
Um, here.

01:29:29.622 --> 01:29:31.521
Oh, yeah.

01:29:37.460 --> 01:29:38.693
And just so you know...

01:29:38.695 --> 01:29:39.760
Yeah?

01:29:39.762 --> 01:29:42.729
...I'm a Gemini,
on the cusp.

01:29:49.937 --> 01:29:51.536
Thanks.

01:29:54.774 --> 01:29:57.608
So...

01:29:57.610 --> 01:29:59.643
Dallas.

01:29:59.645 --> 01:30:02.812
The big presentation.

01:30:02.814 --> 01:30:04.380
You excited?

01:30:04.382 --> 01:30:05.381
No.

01:30:05.383 --> 01:30:06.943
No?
Not really.

01:30:09.484 --> 01:30:11.685
No.

01:30:11.687 --> 01:30:14.788
I actually just want to
get back home.
