WEBVTT

00:11.957 --> 00:13.593
Excuse me!

00:13.626 --> 00:15.595
Excuse me!

00:15.628 --> 00:17.430
Oh, sorry, Jimmy.
Got to protein-load.

00:17.463 --> 00:21.033
Today in improv class,
we're finally doing Harolds.

00:21.067 --> 00:22.602
Anyway, I really
like my instructor.

00:22.635 --> 00:24.737
And after what
happened with Lindsay,

00:24.770 --> 00:27.940
I think I'm finally ready to
let love into my life again.

00:27.973 --> 00:30.376
You've never had love
in your life.

00:30.410 --> 00:31.887
That's why I need to come up
with an excuse

00:31.911 --> 00:33.613
to see Dorothy after class.

00:33.646 --> 00:37.450
So, I was thinking, after
Stretch and Share, I neg her

00:37.483 --> 00:38.784
and tell her she looks winded

00:38.818 --> 00:40.729
and that she should sign up
for my gym, and that...

00:40.753 --> 00:42.098
Edgar, as always,
you're overthinking it.

00:42.122 --> 00:44.190
For once in your life,
just keep it simple.

00:44.224 --> 00:45.625
You mean just ask her out? No.

00:45.658 --> 00:47.569
Get her hammered
and finger-bang her in your car.

00:47.593 --> 00:49.962
Hmm. Maybe I should
be more direct.

00:49.995 --> 00:52.532
I mean, with Lindsay, I
got friend-zoned for life.

00:52.565 --> 00:55.535
One time, she texted me,
"Yo, girl, want to get brunch?"

00:55.568 --> 00:57.470
Have you noticed
something's up with Gretchen?

00:57.503 --> 00:59.715
You mean how she's been sneaking
out in the middle of the night?

00:59.739 --> 01:01.874
You knew?

01:01.907 --> 01:03.876
Morning.

01:03.909 --> 01:05.578
How-how'd you sleep?

01:05.611 --> 01:07.313
Fine. Okay, good.

01:07.347 --> 01:09.048
Why?

01:09.081 --> 01:11.317
Nothing. You just
look a little tired.

01:11.351 --> 01:13.253
Cool. Thanks.

01:13.286 --> 01:14.954
Your dick's a weird color.

01:14.987 --> 01:17.223
Catch up again tomorrow?

01:17.257 --> 01:19.325
I got to go shower.

01:19.359 --> 01:21.827
Sam released
Shitstain's chinchilla

01:21.861 --> 01:23.229
into Griffith Park.

01:23.263 --> 01:24.830
This feud's out of control.

01:27.032 --> 01:30.102
Why don't you just ask Gretchen
where she's been going at night?

01:30.136 --> 01:32.505
Poor, ignorant Edgar.

01:32.538 --> 01:34.840
You don't just drop
your accusation on a perp

01:34.874 --> 01:37.109
without gathering proper
forensic evidence first,

01:37.143 --> 01:39.579
or they're likely to blow.

01:39.612 --> 01:41.681
LA.

01:41.714 --> 01:43.716
Ah.

02:13.145 --> 02:14.480
Ugh.

02:14.514 --> 02:16.048
Bulbs.

02:18.584 --> 02:20.886
Get hot!

02:20.920 --> 02:23.723
My toast is still bread, Paul!

02:23.756 --> 02:24.957
What's happening?!

02:24.990 --> 02:26.392
Have you been paying
the utilities?

02:26.426 --> 02:27.660
You need to come help me.

02:27.693 --> 02:29.571
Why haven't you cashed
any of the checks I sent?

02:29.595 --> 02:30.730
Cash a check?!

02:30.763 --> 02:32.565
Who am I, Lee lacocca?

02:32.598 --> 02:37.270
Well... I guess I could cover
your bills this month.

02:40.773 --> 02:43.909
Lindsay, I'm sorry
to hear about your power,

02:43.943 --> 02:45.845
but it isn't my problem anymore.

02:47.046 --> 02:49.014
Hello?

02:49.048 --> 02:51.050
Paul?

02:52.452 --> 02:55.755
In a long-term relationship,
hurt feelings are inevitable.

02:55.788 --> 02:59.191
The trick is being able
to communicate that hurt

02:59.225 --> 03:01.093
appropriately and
constructively.

03:01.126 --> 03:03.062
Are you guys sure
you want me here?

03:03.095 --> 03:04.330
Yeah, bitch!

03:04.364 --> 03:06.532
This whole feud was your idea.
This feud

03:06.566 --> 03:07.933
was not my idea.

03:07.967 --> 03:09.735
The fake feud was my idea,

03:09.769 --> 03:11.871
and only for crass,
commercial reasons.

03:11.904 --> 03:14.274
Okay, just to be clear,
you started

03:14.307 --> 03:16.942
a real feud
which then became a fake feud,

03:16.976 --> 03:18.944
which has now become
a real feud again

03:18.978 --> 03:22.882
because the resultant "dis
tracks" have become hurtful?

03:22.915 --> 03:23.949
On this last one,

03:23.983 --> 03:26.118
Sam called me
the black John Turturro.

03:26.151 --> 03:28.354
He called me "skinny fat."

03:28.388 --> 03:31.123
Y'all told Fire 103
I let a dude suck my dick!

03:31.156 --> 03:33.793
You d let a dude suck your dick.
Guys.

03:33.826 --> 03:35.528
Remember, we're just
pretending to be mad.

03:35.561 --> 03:37.797
You guys still need
to be working on new music

03:37.830 --> 03:39.399
for when we stage
the big reunion!

03:39.432 --> 03:40.566
Bitch,

03:40.600 --> 03:42.234
I'm going solo.

03:42.268 --> 03:44.637
I could take a dookie
that would chart higher

03:44.670 --> 03:47.807
than anything I ever did
with Crustache over here

03:47.840 --> 03:50.209
and Mr. 800-On-His-SATs.

03:50.242 --> 03:52.445
I told you that in confidence.
Whatever.

03:52.478 --> 03:54.614
Forget you tricks! I'm done.

03:58.918 --> 04:01.253
May I use the remaining time

04:01.287 --> 04:03.689
to talk about
my parents' divorce?

04:04.924 --> 04:06.326
Dad, I told you

04:06.359 --> 04:08.794
that we'd have a great time
at the museum.

04:08.828 --> 04:10.896
Yeah, but where were
all these boobs at?!

04:10.930 --> 04:13.499
And blackout!

04:13.533 --> 04:16.769
Great class, you guys!
Really good today.

04:16.802 --> 04:18.338
Good class. Good class.

04:18.370 --> 04:20.272
Good work.

04:25.378 --> 04:26.846
Hey. Hey.

04:26.879 --> 04:28.448
Um, so listen.

04:28.481 --> 04:30.816
I think you're funny and cute,
and I'd like to take you out

04:30.850 --> 04:32.352
on a date with me
for-for a date.

04:32.385 --> 04:34.687
Is this a bit?

04:34.720 --> 04:38.658
I don't think so, but I'm still
not 100% sure what a bit is.

04:38.691 --> 04:40.360
Wait, are you asking
me on a date?

04:40.393 --> 04:42.362
No. Phsh.

04:42.395 --> 04:45.365
Uh, you want to get drunk
and hang out in my car?

04:45.398 --> 04:47.166
No. Please don't take it back.

04:47.199 --> 04:50.035
Uh... you know guys
don't do that, right?

04:50.069 --> 04:51.937
At least not comedy guys.

04:51.971 --> 04:54.139
I mean, I might get a text
that's like, "You up?"

04:54.173 --> 04:56.275
That's how comedy dudes
ask you out. They joke.

04:56.308 --> 04:57.710
Like, "Wouldn't it be so funny"

04:57.743 --> 04:59.779
if you came over and
were sucking my dick?"

04:59.812 --> 05:01.013
And then, next thing you know,

05:01.046 --> 05:02.391
you've joked yourself
into sucking their dick.

05:02.415 --> 05:05.050
Uh, so, is-is that a no?

05:05.084 --> 05:08.020
No! You just broke my
brain a little bit. Yes.

05:08.053 --> 05:10.923
Uh, you want to go
somewhere right now?

05:21.266 --> 05:23.135
Thanks again for picking me up.

05:23.168 --> 05:24.904
How is a person supposed to know

05:24.937 --> 05:26.906
they have to put oil
in their car?

05:26.939 --> 05:29.308
There's a little oil can light
on your dashboard.

05:29.341 --> 05:31.811
Paul took care
of all that garbage.

05:31.844 --> 05:34.747
And now I don't have power,
I don't have hot water,

05:34.780 --> 05:36.816
I don't have TV!

05:36.849 --> 05:38.851
I'm like a frontiers woman.

05:38.884 --> 05:42.988
I'm like Reese Witherspoon in
that commercial for backpacks.

05:43.022 --> 05:47.159
Right. Lindsay, I asked you
to lunch for a reason.

05:47.192 --> 05:48.260
Oh.

05:48.293 --> 05:49.595
Gretchen keeps sneaking out

05:49.629 --> 05:51.263
in the middle of the night.

05:51.296 --> 05:52.932
Do you know where she's going?

05:52.965 --> 05:54.934
Probably got a side bitch.

05:56.469 --> 05:59.104
I don't think she has a...
a side bitch. Oh, Jimmy.

05:59.138 --> 06:01.206
Let me tell you
how relationships work.

06:01.240 --> 06:02.374
You cheat,

06:02.408 --> 06:05.344
and then she cheats, and
then, one day you wake up,

06:05.377 --> 06:07.547
and he's gone,
none of your stuff works,

06:07.580 --> 06:10.282
and you're having crabby puffs
with some British guy.

06:10.315 --> 06:11.951
I'll give you a ride.
You know what?

06:11.984 --> 06:16.489
No. I'm gonna figure out
how to get home on my own.

06:18.924 --> 06:20.893
That's the kitchen.

07:25.991 --> 07:27.359
No.

07:34.900 --> 07:36.802
Ah.

08:09.935 --> 08:11.737
Ugh.

08:25.217 --> 08:27.219
Ah.

09:09.895 --> 09:12.698
Oh, I've created a monster!

09:12.732 --> 09:15.200
Sam just tweeted an
old photo of Shitstain

09:15.234 --> 09:17.937
in his scoliosis brace.
Why are you dressed like that?

09:17.970 --> 09:21.807
I was thinking you and I
could go out for a proper drink.

09:21.841 --> 09:23.375
Oh. Okay.

09:23.408 --> 09:25.711
Actually, I heard
about this cool new bar

09:25.745 --> 09:27.088
that's opening
tonight in Hollywood.

09:27.112 --> 09:29.715
Cool, new bar in Hollywood?

09:29.749 --> 09:31.216
You like old, gross bars

09:31.250 --> 09:32.384
in sketchtown.

09:32.417 --> 09:34.386
Edgar might bring
a girl home tonight,

09:34.419 --> 09:35.764
so it's probably
in our best interest

09:35.788 --> 09:37.122
to evacuate the premises.

09:37.156 --> 09:38.557
I mean, can you imagine

09:38.590 --> 09:40.225
the nightmarish cacophony
of rage sounds

09:40.259 --> 09:42.494
that will emanate from that
room when he finally enters

09:42.527 --> 09:44.496
a live human woman
after years...

09:44.529 --> 09:46.498
Eject!

09:46.531 --> 09:47.933
New bar it is.

09:50.870 --> 09:53.973
It must be so cool to be
on such a long-running team.

09:54.006 --> 09:56.575
Hey, Put That Down,
Brian! Is an institution.

09:56.608 --> 09:59.344
Honestly, it's hard
being the only girl.

09:59.378 --> 10:01.513
The guys are always
showing me their dicks.

10:01.546 --> 10:02.982
Or worse than that, their balls.

10:03.015 --> 10:04.159
"Hanging brain," they call it.

10:04.183 --> 10:05.450
All the guys do that?

10:05.484 --> 10:06.952
For my birthday,
they gave me a mug.

10:06.986 --> 10:08.954
It looked like it had
a bunch of inkblots on it.

10:08.988 --> 10:10.465
Turns out, they had gone
to Color Me Mine,

10:10.489 --> 10:11.623
dipped their balls in paint

10:11.657 --> 10:13.034
and tea-bagged the mug
a bunch of times.

10:13.058 --> 10:14.927
That's sexual harassment!

10:14.960 --> 10:16.762
And I should know,
we were trained in that.

10:16.796 --> 10:18.931
There's no such thing
as sexual harassment in comedy.

10:18.964 --> 10:20.599
You're just
a "no fun tight-ass,"

10:20.632 --> 10:22.434
and then pretty soon,
you get the tired,

10:22.467 --> 10:24.545
"girls aren't funny" bullshit,
all stemming from the fact

10:24.569 --> 10:26.171
that you didn't want
to bone down

10:26.205 --> 10:27.548
with some insecure
five-six neckbeard

10:27.572 --> 10:30.142
who once had a meeting
with Bob Odenkirk so he thinks

10:30.175 --> 10:31.911
he's no longer
a repulsive troll.

10:33.578 --> 10:37.783
Look, I'm no expert, but...

10:37.817 --> 10:41.721
maybe you should be more direct

10:41.754 --> 10:43.889
about your feelings
with these guys.

10:43.923 --> 10:46.892
I mean, I was
nervous to tell you

10:46.926 --> 10:50.696
how I felt, but...

10:50.730 --> 10:54.333
I'm really glad that I did.

10:54.366 --> 10:56.335
Yeah?

10:56.368 --> 10:58.370
Me, too.

11:14.253 --> 11:16.989
So, what can I get you?

11:17.022 --> 11:19.691
Hmm. What's the Alpirsbach?

11:19.725 --> 11:21.360
That one originates
from Germany,

11:21.393 --> 11:23.328
but we've separated
the hydrogen molecules

11:23.362 --> 11:25.497
and infused them with lavender.

11:25.530 --> 11:27.499
Yeah, okay. But what's
in it? Is it gin?

11:27.532 --> 11:28.700
This is a water bar.

11:28.734 --> 11:29.835
A what now?

11:29.869 --> 11:31.270
Aechtoeau

11:31.303 --> 11:33.739
serves
the finest artisanal water

11:33.773 --> 11:35.941
from around the globe.

11:35.975 --> 11:37.777
Jimmy, what's happening?

11:37.810 --> 11:40.345
Yeah, I read a listicle

11:40.379 --> 11:42.281
about the benefits of hydration.

11:42.314 --> 11:45.017
I am going to the bathroom,

11:45.050 --> 11:46.185
and when I get back,

11:46.218 --> 11:47.887
you are going
to take me to a real bar

11:47.920 --> 11:50.555
and feed me cheap whiskey
until I forget about that time

11:50.589 --> 11:52.224
that I stopped being able
to have sex

11:52.257 --> 11:53.859
with my boyfriend ever again

11:53.893 --> 11:57.897
because he took me to a bar
that only served water.

12:20.352 --> 12:21.887
Well, well, well.

12:21.921 --> 12:23.388
Ty Wyland.

12:23.422 --> 12:24.656
Jimmy. Nice to see you.

12:24.689 --> 12:26.167
Oh, so that's
how you're gonna play it, is it?

12:26.191 --> 12:27.492
Like the two of you haven't been

12:27.526 --> 12:28.828
sneaking around in the wee hours

12:28.861 --> 12:30.595
like a goddamn Pinter play?

12:45.044 --> 12:47.579
As I was saying, the-the, um...

12:47.612 --> 12:50.249
the... Gretchen, hi.

12:50.282 --> 12:54.286
Oh. You look ravishing.

12:55.287 --> 12:59.358
Ty. Why... are you?

12:59.391 --> 13:00.459
Oh, this is my place.

13:00.492 --> 13:01.994
Got to say, not surprised.

13:02.027 --> 13:04.529
Right. You two catch up.
I'll be back.

13:08.500 --> 13:10.635
Ty, you opened a bar.

13:10.669 --> 13:12.771
Kinda. Yeah.

13:12.804 --> 13:14.606
Well, not alone.

13:14.639 --> 13:16.775
Adam Levine, Swaggy P,
and I were in Vegas

13:16.808 --> 13:18.978
talking about Maslow's
hierarchy of needs.

13:19.011 --> 13:21.813
Interesting thing,
actually, with that...

13:23.515 --> 13:25.150
Sorry I couldn't be there, babe.

13:25.184 --> 13:27.219
I know
it's perineum massage night,

13:27.252 --> 13:29.554
so I made you
this instructional vid.

13:29.588 --> 13:31.823
This'll help what's-his-butt

13:31.857 --> 13:34.793
slide right on out. So, first,

13:34.826 --> 13:36.962
it's time to lube those thumbs.

13:36.996 --> 13:39.731
Next, you're gonna take
those thumbs

13:39.764 --> 13:42.734
and insert them
about three centimeters.

13:42.767 --> 13:44.970
And I know you can handle it
because your thumbs

13:45.004 --> 13:46.405
are not as big as my dick.

13:47.940 --> 13:48.908
Kidding.

13:48.941 --> 13:50.575
But, really, they're not.

13:50.609 --> 13:52.811
Now it's time to start

13:52.844 --> 13:55.747
the gentle massaging,

13:55.780 --> 13:59.251
round and down. Ready?

13:59.284 --> 14:02.587
Round and down.

14:02.621 --> 14:04.489
Good.

14:04.523 --> 14:06.091
Round...

14:09.028 --> 14:10.996
Uh, what the hell
happened to you?

14:11.030 --> 14:14.166
My power got turned off. Well...

14:14.199 --> 14:17.269
I don't know how to do anything.

14:17.302 --> 14:19.438
Well, now,
don't beat yourself up.

14:19.471 --> 14:21.440
It's probably Mom's fault.

14:21.473 --> 14:23.342
Probably.

14:23.375 --> 14:26.378
She did always take
so many more photos of me.

14:27.379 --> 14:28.847
Do you need a place to crash,

14:28.880 --> 14:30.849
huh, until your power
gets turned back on?

14:30.882 --> 14:31.850
Yeah?

14:31.883 --> 14:34.519
Yeah. Come on.

14:34.553 --> 14:37.189
Yeah. The guest room's
a nursery now,

14:37.222 --> 14:40.025
but you... Okay. You can sleep
in Vernon's man cave.

14:40.059 --> 14:42.099
He's at the hospital
and I'm going to prenatal yoga,

14:42.127 --> 14:45.397
so, eh, the house
should be fairly quiet.

14:45.430 --> 14:47.532
But I'm sure you're used
to the deafening silence

14:47.566 --> 14:48.900
of an empty house by now.

14:53.505 --> 14:54.506
Oh.

14:56.175 --> 14:58.477
Mmm. You and I need to talk.

14:58.510 --> 15:00.045
No shit.

15:00.079 --> 15:02.914
Your girl's been sending me
banana-ass texts all day.

15:02.948 --> 15:04.783
Actually, I sent those messages.

15:04.816 --> 15:06.218
Look, just tell me,

15:06.251 --> 15:08.587
are you her side bitch?

15:08.620 --> 15:11.056
What? Hell no!

15:11.090 --> 15:12.992
Bitch eats floor candy.

15:13.025 --> 15:16.095
Ain't seen a foreign film
in a decade.

15:16.128 --> 15:17.963
Do you know why
she has a burner?

15:17.997 --> 15:19.064
Oh, the God phone?

15:19.098 --> 15:20.732
I gave her that
because sleepy bitches

15:20.765 --> 15:22.267
don't deserve regular phones.

15:22.301 --> 15:24.169
She didn't tell you
about my clever speech?

15:24.203 --> 15:25.737
Now,

15:25.770 --> 15:29.074
I'm gonna go hit up that girl
with the booty jorts over there.

15:29.108 --> 15:30.342
Oh, yeah. Mmm.

15:30.375 --> 15:32.144
She looks hydrated as hell!

15:32.177 --> 15:33.245
Yeah.

15:33.278 --> 15:34.813
And, honestly,

15:34.846 --> 15:36.848
I was thinking
about postponing the whole trip.

15:36.881 --> 15:40.185
The Nepalese government
just put all these restrictions

15:40.219 --> 15:43.422
on Everest because of the whole
human waste pollution.

15:43.455 --> 15:45.790
Talk about a pile of shit,
right?

15:45.824 --> 15:47.792
Well, that's the problem,
Gretchen.

15:47.826 --> 15:49.228
No one does.

15:50.629 --> 15:55.467
Hey, isn't that Christoph Waltz?

15:55.500 --> 15:57.102
Excuse me.

15:57.136 --> 15:58.703
Christoph!

16:34.005 --> 16:36.341
This isn't about
forgetting a prop.

16:36.375 --> 16:37.509
You guys never bring props.

16:37.542 --> 16:40.179
Uh, I made that big-ass
strawberry last month.

16:40.212 --> 16:42.181
Mm-hmm.

16:43.415 --> 16:45.016
I feel...

16:45.050 --> 16:47.186
I feel like this group
doesn't respect me.

16:47.219 --> 16:48.353
What?

16:48.387 --> 16:49.897
You guys are always
showing me your balls.

16:49.921 --> 16:51.161
We're just joking around. Yeah.

16:51.190 --> 16:52.791
It's sexual harassment.

16:53.725 --> 16:55.527
I'm a feminist. I was raised

16:55.560 --> 16:57.496
by two strong lesbians.
You know I only use

16:57.529 --> 16:58.539
my balls ironically.
Okay, and besides,

16:58.563 --> 17:00.532
okay, you didn't seem to mind

17:00.565 --> 17:03.668
my balls when you were sucking
on 'em for all these years. Oh.

17:03.702 --> 17:05.170
Boom!

17:05.204 --> 17:07.214
Hey, you want to know why nobody
wants you to direct their shows?

17:07.239 --> 17:10.575
Because you're a jerk and
your mise en scène sucks.

17:10.608 --> 17:12.577
Oh, so you want to get honest
right now, huh?

17:12.611 --> 17:14.713
Well, honestly, I am clearly

17:14.746 --> 17:17.015
the most talented person
in this group,

17:17.048 --> 17:18.717
and, as such,
I am sick and tired

17:18.750 --> 17:21.252
of you guys refusing
to let me do "Baby Undertaker"!

17:21.286 --> 17:23.722
"Baby Undertaker" isn't funny!

17:23.755 --> 17:24.888
You isn't funny!

17:24.923 --> 17:27.358
You know, I think
it's finally time to admit

17:27.392 --> 17:30.429
that Hey, Put That Down,
Brian! Is going nowhere,

17:30.462 --> 17:32.197
just like all of you guys, okay?

17:32.231 --> 17:34.065
So, suck it, double suck it,

17:34.099 --> 17:35.567
you don't get to suck it
anymore.

17:35.600 --> 17:38.437
Tall Nathan out.

17:38.470 --> 17:40.472
For good.

17:42.107 --> 17:44.209
Wait. Tall Nathan!

17:44.243 --> 17:45.577
I'm out, too.

17:48.580 --> 17:51.583
Are you okay?

17:51.616 --> 17:55.053
I can't believe Tall Nathan
talked to you like that.

17:55.086 --> 17:57.088
Things have been getting weird.

17:57.122 --> 17:59.791
We've been sleeping together on
and off for the last seven years.

17:59.824 --> 18:01.426
Oh.

18:01.460 --> 18:03.928
I can't believe
the group is done.

18:03.962 --> 18:08.633
My God, I wasted all of my 20s
and part of my 30s.

18:10.034 --> 18:12.036
Can I do anything?

18:14.373 --> 18:16.775
You could hang out with me
a lot.

18:16.808 --> 18:20.379
I suddenly have tons
of free time.

18:29.154 --> 18:30.689
Watch your step.

18:41.500 --> 18:43.835
Lindsay?

18:45.370 --> 18:47.439
You found me.

18:47.472 --> 18:50.141
Yeah. What are you doing here?

18:50.175 --> 18:52.811
I don't know how to do anything.

18:52.844 --> 18:54.346
Hey.

18:56.348 --> 18:58.983
I'm here.

18:59.017 --> 19:02.187
Everything's gonna be okay. Shh.

19:02.221 --> 19:04.155
Wh-Whoa.

19:04.189 --> 19:07.025
Linds, no.

19:07.058 --> 19:09.027
Look, it's real tempting.

19:09.060 --> 19:11.330
Your bazungas are epic stupid.

19:11.363 --> 19:13.040
And ever since Becca hit
her second trimest,

19:13.064 --> 19:15.133
she's been a total cooze.

19:15.166 --> 19:17.135
But I love her,

19:17.168 --> 19:20.339
and I can't do that
to the mother of my child.

19:27.746 --> 19:30.181
I'm gonna let you
get some sleep.

19:32.751 --> 19:35.887
Wait. Vernon?

19:35.920 --> 19:39.190
Do you think I'm useless?

19:39.224 --> 19:41.025
You might not be useful
in the tradish sense,

19:41.059 --> 19:43.395
but you're a good friend.
You make people happy.

19:46.398 --> 19:48.700
Will you hold me?

19:48.733 --> 19:51.403
Just for a minute.

19:58.743 --> 20:01.045
Linds?

20:01.079 --> 20:03.214
Fine.

20:03.248 --> 20:06.084
Honk honk. A-ooga.

21:06.478 --> 21:08.613
Jesus Christ.

21:08.647 --> 21:11.483
What are you doing?
Nothing. Just...

21:11.516 --> 21:13.652
crying in my car.

21:13.685 --> 21:14.953
Is it something I did?

21:14.986 --> 21:17.155
No.

21:17.188 --> 21:19.791
So you're not... sleeping
with someone else?

21:19.824 --> 21:21.326
No, Jimmy. We're fine.

21:22.361 --> 21:25.296
Right.

21:25.330 --> 21:27.799
So, should I leave you alone
then?

21:27.832 --> 21:29.934
Yeah. Probably. Okay,

21:29.968 --> 21:32.337
well, see you. Uh...

21:33.505 --> 21:35.106
So why'd you bring the phone?

21:35.139 --> 21:37.108
Oh, I...

21:37.141 --> 21:39.478
I like to play Snake
while I cry.

21:39.511 --> 21:40.979
Oh.

21:41.012 --> 21:44.716
Well, that's-that's
a classic game, that.

21:55.159 --> 21:58.830
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

22:44.375 --> 22:48.413
You know, if you lowered me
about three feet...

22:58.923 --> 23:02.026
When a thoroughbred is retired,
he's put out to stud.

23:02.060 --> 23:04.596
My only regret is that I cannot
inject my excellence into...

23:04.629 --> 23:06.197
Future generations,

23:06.230 --> 23:08.567
who will know that I
respected and admired...

23:08.600 --> 23:12.637
Boobs. Boobs do not make you
less of a fantasy player.

23:12.671 --> 23:16.207
I dominated these guys.
I stomped all over their...

23:16.240 --> 23:18.443
Sacks. Touchdowns.

23:18.477 --> 23:21.379
Doesn't matter how you score, as
long as you leave everything...

23:21.412 --> 23:23.114
In the toilet.

23:23.147 --> 23:25.884
Every year, my team inevitably
ends up in the crapper.

23:25.917 --> 23:27.452
Sometimes I feel like I...

23:27.486 --> 23:30.622
Smoked everything in sight.

23:30.655 --> 23:32.557
Wait. What were we talking about?
Eskimo bro!

23:32.591 --> 23:35.660
The League.

Sunny is back...

23:59.050 --> 24:00.785
Ha-ha-ha!

24:13.364 --> 24:15.199
- We have come to have sex with you.
- Holy...

24:17.001 --> 24:19.170
What are you
looking for exactly?

24:25.209 --> 24:27.278
Why not get
surgically conjoined?

24:27.311 --> 24:31.215
Man Seeking Woman. An all
new season January on FXX.
