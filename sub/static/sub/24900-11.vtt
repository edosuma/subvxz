If you had listened to
the Professor and let me drive,

14:58.932 --> 15:00.623
this never
have happened!

15:00.658 --> 15:02.487
No, it would have
happened faster

15:02.522 --> 15:06.975
because you are the slooowest
driver in the world!

15:07.009 --> 15:09.080
You got something you want
to say to me?

15:09.115 --> 15:11.669
Lots of things.Bring it on!

15:11.703 --> 15:15.742
Yes! Yes, this seems
like a good use of our time.

15:15.776 --> 15:18.158
She started it!I did not!

15:18.193 --> 15:19.332
Quiet!

15:19.366 --> 15:22.507
If Mojo must sit and watch
the world be destroyed,

15:22.542 --> 15:23.784
he'd rather not
have to listen

15:23.819 --> 15:27.133
to pathetic
Punypuffs quibbling!

15:27.167 --> 15:28.410
What do you want, Mojo?

15:28.444 --> 15:32.345
This Jemoomoo lady
forgot one thing in her plans.

15:32.379 --> 15:33.691
Yeah, what's that?

15:33.725 --> 15:37.350
Mojo already called dibs
on conquering the world.

15:37.384 --> 15:40.663
Mojo suggests
we should all work together

15:40.698 --> 15:44.978
to stop this ultimate...ehh...
lesser evil.

15:45.013 --> 15:47.981
I hate to say it,
but Mojo is right.

15:48.016 --> 15:50.880
We need to stop bickering
and come up with a plan.

15:50.915 --> 15:53.849
And I already
thought of one.

15:53.883 --> 15:57.128
Jemoiré is marching her army
towards Townsville.

15:57.163 --> 16:00.131
We'll circle around
and head her off at the archway.

16:00.166 --> 16:03.376
Buttercup and I will
smash a path through her army,

16:03.410 --> 16:05.895
which will allow a clear shot
for Mojo Jojo

16:05.930 --> 16:08.208
to hit her
with his Deceleray.

16:08.243 --> 16:10.107
Mojo's slow-mo gun?

16:10.141 --> 16:12.005
We may not be able
to stop Jemoiré,

16:12.040 --> 16:13.869
but we can
slow her down.

16:13.903 --> 16:16.216
Mojo has but one problem --

16:16.251 --> 16:20.289
because of this accursed,
yet breath-taking, solar eclipse

16:20.324 --> 16:22.740
the ray does not have
much power left.

16:24.949 --> 16:26.847
Your Deceleray is
solar-powered?

16:26.882 --> 16:30.403
Excuse Mojo
for thinking green.

16:30.437 --> 16:33.682
Still, Mojo should have
enough juice for one shot.

16:33.716 --> 16:36.029
Well, you better
make that shot count.

16:36.064 --> 16:39.377
Well, gee,
no pressure or anything.

16:53.115 --> 16:55.773
Soon, we'll
be upon Townsville,

16:55.807 --> 16:57.878
where I will banish their souls

16:57.913 --> 17:00.950
to the eternal darkness
of the storm!

17:00.985 --> 17:05.507
Go forth. Destroy.
Destroy for your queen!

17:06.646 --> 17:07.578
Huh?

17:07.612 --> 17:10.925
♪ Freight train comin'

17:10.960 --> 17:12.271
Mojo, you ready?

17:12.307 --> 17:15.689
Mojo is obviously
the most ready of all.

17:15.723 --> 17:18.415
Better be.Again with the pressure!

17:18.451 --> 17:19.762
Let's go!

17:27.598 --> 17:30.290
Ugh.
Impudent insects.

17:36.503 --> 17:38.747
♪ I believe it

17:40.162 --> 17:41.577
♪ I believe in good

17:41.612 --> 17:43.407
It's clear, Mojo!

17:43.441 --> 17:45.719
Mojo's time to shine.

17:50.345 --> 17:53.934
Think your toy can stop me?

17:53.969 --> 17:57.145
Yes, Mojo is
pretty confident.

17:57.179 --> 18:00.148
Graah!

18:00.182 --> 18:02.805
Uhh, still
fairly confident.

18:05.014 --> 18:06.809
Confidence fading fast.

18:10.813 --> 18:13.264
Okay, time to bail.

18:25.173 --> 18:28.003
Oh, no!
That was our only shot!

18:28.037 --> 18:30.592
Out of power.

18:30.626 --> 18:32.352
Bloss, look out!

18:32.387 --> 18:33.664
Hmm?

18:36.494 --> 18:37.702
Huh?

18:37.737 --> 18:39.773
A little help please?

18:43.294 --> 18:47.471
Crush them.

18:50.405 --> 18:54.892
S-Sorry I was being
such a punk earlier.

18:54.926 --> 18:59.897
Ugh. N-No,
I was being a brat, too.

18:59.931 --> 19:03.452
Ugh. It's been nice
bickering with you.

19:03.487 --> 19:05.454
D-Ditto.

19:07.215 --> 19:08.733
Huh?

19:08.768 --> 19:10.839
♪ Oh, I wanna have lunch
with somebody ♪Huh?

19:25.371 --> 19:26.648
No!

19:26.682 --> 19:29.823
Ugh!

19:29.858 --> 19:31.860
Hi, guys.
Did I win the race?

19:31.894 --> 19:33.517
Bubbles!

19:33.551 --> 19:34.759
Great job!

19:34.794 --> 19:37.106
I-I guess
I did win the race.

19:38.798 --> 19:40.351
What's with doofus?

19:40.386 --> 19:41.525
Oh!

19:41.559 --> 19:44.217
Donny, we're
not underwater anymore.

19:44.252 --> 19:46.185
You don't have to keep
holding your breath.

19:49.257 --> 19:52.432
I was saying,
"Who set up the disco ball?"

19:55.055 --> 19:58.024
Ugh!
Enough of this foolishness!

19:58.058 --> 20:02.787
Prepare to face
the eye of the storm!

20:06.757 --> 20:08.724
Ahem!

20:08.759 --> 20:10.623
Halt vile creature!

20:10.657 --> 20:12.866
Perhaps you need a bowl of --

20:14.420 --> 20:16.042
Good thing I brought
an umbrella.

20:16.076 --> 20:17.561
Ooh!

20:17.595 --> 20:19.356
Good thing lightning
never strikes in the same pla--

20:21.012 --> 20:22.566
Whew.
Good thing --

20:24.188 --> 20:26.639
Let's go, g--

20:29.331 --> 20:32.265
I have more pressing matters
to attend to.

20:34.025 --> 20:37.408
Not so fast, Jemoomoo.

20:37.443 --> 20:39.928
Those are my archenemies
you're messing with.

20:39.962 --> 20:41.999
If you want dibs
on Townsville,

20:42.033 --> 20:45.002
you're going to have to go
through Mojo Jo--

20:47.211 --> 20:49.282
Mojo meant
that rhetorically.

20:49.317 --> 20:53.321
I've waited thousands of years
to reclaim my throne.

20:53.355 --> 20:55.184
Did you think
I could be stopped

20:55.219 --> 20:57.290
by a feeble,
little green monkey?

20:57.325 --> 21:00.949
No...Mojo was just buying time.

21:00.983 --> 21:03.089
Huh. For what?

21:03.123 --> 21:05.678
For this.

21:12.892 --> 21:15.032
Full power.

21:15.066 --> 21:16.861
Hit it, Buttercup.

21:16.896 --> 21:18.346
Huh? No!

21:22.522 --> 21:23.523
Ugh.

21:23.558 --> 21:26.595
That definitely
wasn't worth it.

21:26.630 --> 21:29.218
And so, in what was
a most remarkable

21:29.253 --> 21:31.117
and convenient
turn of events,

21:31.151 --> 21:34.223
I was re-formed from
all those tiny grains of sand.

21:36.743 --> 21:39.953
Now let us celebrate
Townsville's heroes.

21:39.988 --> 21:43.232
Three cheers for...
the Powerpuff Girls!

21:43.267 --> 21:46.339
Yes!
With Jemoomoo out of the way,

21:46.374 --> 21:51.344
I shall take over this town,
once and for -- aah!

21:51.379 --> 21:54.692
So...who wants
