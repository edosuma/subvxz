You can't sing for crap.

Yeah. I'm Leonard Chess.

desire to make you a star.

00:25.100 --> 00:26.367

00:26.433 --> 00:29.333
-Damn straight.
Okay.

00:38.333 --> 00:40.233
What did he say?

00:42.400 --> 00:43.733
Sam never showed.

00:45.300 --> 00:47.367
Dewey figured he went on home.

Oh, we need to avert
our eyes from this, Jerry Lee.

04:11.233 --> 04:14.200
So you've been saying for
the past couple of hours now.

04:14.267 --> 04:17.067

a mind of their own now,

04:17.133 --> 04:18.500
don't they?

04:19.300 --> 04:20.533
-Whoo!
-Oh.

04:20.600 --> 04:22.633

looks like that.

Don't you dare
talk about my girl like that.

04:25.167 --> 04:26.833
Huh? Your girl?

04:26.900 --> 04:28.400
Pretty sure it was me
she was eyeing

04:28.467 --> 04:31.500
after I dazzled her with my
exquisite ivory tickling.

04:31.567 --> 04:33.067
Only look that angel
was giving you

04:33.067 --> 04:35.400
was one of pity
for your unsalvaged soul.

04:35.467 --> 04:36.867
Well, why don't we
let Peggy decide

04:36.933 --> 04:39.133
who's right in this little
difference of opinion?

04:39.200 --> 04:40.600
Huh?

04:40.667 --> 04:42.800
Jerry Lee,
Jimmy, I need a lil' help!

04:42.867 --> 04:45.200
Okay, Momma.

04:46.733 --> 04:49.067
Fine.
May the best man win.

04:49.067 --> 04:50.867
Well, suits me, cuz,
'cause you know what?

04:50.933 --> 04:52.167
I always do.

04:52.233 --> 04:53.233
Ow.

05:02.633 --> 05:05.700
Hey, sugar,
got some more for you.

05:05.767 --> 05:08.800
Oh, you are a godsend.

05:08.867 --> 05:10.967
We sure can use the work.

05:12.500 --> 05:14.733
-Is everything okay?

05:15.900 --> 05:19.533
Uh, fine, fine. How're you?

05:20.167 --> 05:21.633
How's Sam?

05:21.700 --> 05:23.467
This morning, he looked like
something the cat dragged in

05:23.533 --> 05:24.967
and the goat wouldn't eat.

05:25.067 --> 05:28.133
Just a little mishap.

05:28.200 --> 05:29.667
Now, Becky...

05:29.733 --> 05:32.233
I'm not one to gossip.

05:32.300 --> 05:34.067
But, I'm just saying

05:34.067 --> 05:37.700
the paperboy told Gladys Twain
from down the street

05:39.067 --> 05:41.933
that he saw Sam
take his trousers off outside

05:42.067 --> 05:44.067
for God and country to see.

05:44.133 --> 05:46.867
And she told the widower
Mr. Petty down at the garage

05:46.933 --> 05:49.067
who told Betsy who can't
keep her mouth shut...

05:52.900 --> 05:54.067
Sam!

05:55.533 --> 05:57.600
Sorry.

05:57.667 --> 06:00.067
Always a pleasure
to see you, Nadine.

06:11.600 --> 06:14.167
Bless your heart, dear.

06:26.567 --> 06:27.900
Where are you off to?

06:28.867 --> 06:30.267
Got a session.

06:34.700 --> 06:35.967
What?

06:37.200 --> 06:39.967
Well, it's just 5:00
in the afternoon,

06:40.067 --> 06:43.167
and my husband, who's now
the talk of the town,

06:43.233 --> 06:47.500
just woke up
having been out all night

06:47.567 --> 06:49.800
without letting me know
where he was.

06:49.867 --> 06:53.367
And after smashing
the family car,

06:53.433 --> 06:58.167
he just walks around
like it's all la-di-da,

06:58.233 --> 07:00.433
and then asks, "What?"

07:03.733 --> 07:05.267
You know what, Becks,

07:05.333 --> 07:08.300
I'm jammed up all day long
with sessions.

07:08.367 --> 07:12.167
Night time's the only time
I got to find new acts.

07:12.900 --> 07:14.233
I gotta go.

07:14.300 --> 07:15.433
Sam...

07:16.767 --> 07:18.067
I thought we came here

07:18.067 --> 07:21.067
to build a stable
recording business.

07:21.067 --> 07:23.467
Commercials, testimonials,
recitals...

07:23.533 --> 07:25.800
And if you haven't noticed,

07:25.867 --> 07:30.867
you've taken in half
the neighborhood's sewing,

07:30.933 --> 07:33.700
'cause the recording part
ain't cutting it.

07:35.167 --> 07:38.500
I... I thought Rocket 88
was the big hit we needed?

07:38.567 --> 07:40.600
Huh. Yeah.

07:40.667 --> 07:42.267
Turns out that drunk Brenston

07:42.333 --> 07:45.200
ain't nothing but
a damned one-hit wonder.

07:45.267 --> 07:48.700
Look, I can't pay today's
bills on yesterday's hits.

07:48.767 --> 07:50.167
Sam.

07:52.900 --> 07:55.200
I'm worried about you.

07:55.267 --> 07:57.500
I made an appointment
with a new doctor,

07:57.567 --> 07:59.367
and I think that we...

08:02.633 --> 08:04.767
Thanks for consulting me.

08:05.833 --> 08:08.167
You're my wife, Becky.

08:08.233 --> 08:10.267
Stop acting like
my damn mother!

08:10.333 --> 08:13.867
Well, you stop acting
like a damn child!

08:19.933 --> 08:21.367
Well, I don't need this.

08:21.433 --> 08:22.767
I've got work to do!

08:27.067 --> 08:31.433
Two Japs, out of ammo,
rushed me with bayonets.

08:31.500 --> 08:32.767
Time I was done,

08:32.833 --> 08:34.167
you couldn't have
matched up the pieces

08:34.233 --> 08:36.233
to tell "chop" from "suey"
if they paid you.

08:36.300 --> 08:39.567
Uh, Mr. Dean, sir,
may I please have a word?

08:39.633 --> 08:41.067
Get out of here, boy.

08:41.067 --> 08:43.933
You don't have a thing to say
I wanna hear.

08:45.267 --> 08:47.433
-Sir?
-I'll be back.

08:47.500 --> 08:50.167
You just cost me a sale.
What do you want?

08:50.233 --> 08:52.567
To apologize.

08:52.633 --> 08:54.500
Look, I'm sorry
if I did anything

08:54.567 --> 08:56.767
to disrespect you
or your family.

08:56.833 --> 09:00.500
-That wasn't my intention.
-What was your intention?

09:00.567 --> 09:02.933
-I just like the music is all.

09:03.067 --> 09:06.667
You don't drink from colored
water fountains, do you, boy?

09:07.400 --> 09:09.533
Well, no, sir.

09:09.600 --> 09:10.967
Well, you see my point?

09:13.400 --> 09:15.333
You may be kissing my daughter

09:15.400 --> 09:17.833
with those lips of yours
someday.

09:19.300 --> 09:21.333
It won't happen again, sir.

09:21.400 --> 09:23.433
I care deeply about Trixie.

09:23.500 --> 09:25.633
I'd never do anything
to harm her.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.900
-I believe you.

09:29.967 --> 09:31.967
And hell, boy,

09:32.067 --> 09:35.233
can't have you climbing up
my house every night.

09:35.300 --> 09:36.500
You'll ruin the siding.

09:37.267 --> 09:38.500
Get!

09:56.767 --> 09:58.367
Hey, Trixie from Dixie.

09:58.433 --> 10:00.067
Hey, you know,
I talked to your daddy.

10:00.067 --> 10:01.133
That so?

10:01.200 --> 10:02.467
Oh, honey,
everything is hunky dory.

10:02.533 --> 10:03.633
And?

10:03.700 --> 10:06.933
-Well, he forgave me.
-Did he?

10:07.000 --> 10:09.900
Well, maybe you two
should go steady. Hmm.

10:14.500 --> 10:16.233
Stop pestering her.

10:24.200 --> 10:26.733
I tell you, Beau, this better
be one hell of a bar.

10:26.800 --> 10:31.167
Johnny boy, this ain't just
any old bar. Come on.

11:01.300 --> 11:02.733
Uh...

11:07.733 --> 11:10.300
Why you here?

11:10.367 --> 11:11.700
This Russian sector!

11:11.767 --> 11:13.267
What the hell is he saying?

11:13.333 --> 11:16.300
Well, I think he's saying
we're in the Russian sector.

11:16.367 --> 11:19.100
-Well, we know that.
-We do?

11:19.167 --> 11:21.600
Soon, all Russia.

11:21.667 --> 11:24.667

to save your sorry asses.

11:31.767 --> 11:34.067
Well, lookie
what we have here.

11:35.300 --> 11:38.333
Can't you read a map?
Italy's that way.

11:38.400 --> 11:41.200
We got the commies,
and we got the hillbillies.

11:42.667 --> 11:44.167
They're telling us
they gonna rule the world.

11:44.233 --> 11:45.233
Is that so?

11:46.233 --> 11:47.233
Da.

11:48.433 --> 11:49.900
Hell of a choice.

11:49.967 --> 11:53.133
On one hand, we have sorry
excuses for American GIs.

11:53.200 --> 11:54.233
And on the other...

12:11.733 --> 12:13.833
Guys, let's get
the hell out of here!

12:13.900 --> 12:16.100
Hey, you left this vodka!

12:24.567 --> 12:26.533
No wonder these Russkies
are miserable bastards.

12:26.600 --> 12:28.167
Their damn booze
is made out of potatoes.

12:28.233 --> 12:30.100
Oh, man, who cares if
it's made out of dirty socks,

12:30.167 --> 12:31.633
sure does the job.

12:31.700 --> 12:33.200
What do you expect
from a hick who drinks whiskey

12:33.267 --> 12:34.300
made from corn?

12:34.367 --> 12:35.400
Well, that ain't whiskey,

12:35.467 --> 12:37.900
that'd be, uh, corn liquor.

12:40.167 --> 12:41.600
Fraeulein.

12:42.267 --> 12:44.067
Paesanos!

12:44.067 --> 12:46.567
-What do you mean, paesanos?
-It means stand-up guys.

12:46.633 --> 12:47.833
Oh.

12:47.900 --> 12:49.533
But we're all
stand-up guys tonight.

12:49.600 --> 12:50.967
Party time, boys.

12:51.067 --> 12:52.900

waiting back home.

Bogie and Bacall.

13:00.433 --> 13:02.700

just a rube after all.

13:02.767 --> 13:06.200

just so you can window watch?

13:11.400 --> 13:12.700
How you doing?

13:12.767 --> 13:14.067

saying, but I like it.

Uh, I spent all my money
on my guitars, so I...

13:27.367 --> 13:29.067
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
I'll pay for it.

13:29.067 --> 13:30.333
Besides, I don't...
Danke schoen.

that's all.

13:36.833 --> 13:38.067
Guys, he never did it.

13:38.100 --> 13:39.267
I done it plenty of times.

13:39.333 --> 13:40.700
You never did it.
He never did...

13:40.767 --> 13:41.767
No...

-I had me

14:46.433 --> 14:49.433
a similar situation
with Betty Caldwell last year.

14:50.967 --> 14:53.133
Every time
I tried to talk to her,

14:53.200 --> 14:55.633
damn girlfriends
pulled her away.

14:55.700 --> 14:56.867
What'd you do?

14:56.933 --> 14:59.667
Disguised myself
with a big old Stetson

14:59.733 --> 15:03.433
and followed her one night
after Billy Bean's party.

15:03.500 --> 15:05.233
How'd that turn out?

15:05.300 --> 15:08.233
Guess I kind of startled her.

15:08.300 --> 15:10.833
She kicked me
so hard in the knee.

15:10.900 --> 15:13.700
Blew up big
as a honeydew melon.

15:15.333 --> 15:17.567
Well, I wouldn't be writing
no advice columns

15:38.933 --> 15:41.167
Come to Froggy's
off of Tadpole Street.

15:41.233 --> 15:43.200
Tell them Froggy sent you.

15:45.900 --> 15:47.500
What do you think,
Miss Keister?

15:49.067 --> 15:52.100
It's Keisker,
and it's certainly sincere.

15:52.167 --> 15:55.567
-Uh, maybe a little fast.
-Wrote it myself.

15:55.633 --> 15:57.700
Would never have guessed.

15:57.767 --> 15:59.067
Uh, take a break.

15:59.133 --> 16:00.467
Practice reading it
three times in a row,

16:00.533 --> 16:01.933
and we'll try it again.

16:06.767 --> 16:08.400
Man, oh, man,

16:08.467 --> 16:11.500
Becky just does not
get the music.

16:12.667 --> 16:14.367
And she doesn't get me.

16:17.067 --> 16:19.067
I don't blame her.

16:19.067 --> 16:21.200
Sometimes, I don't get me.

16:23.267 --> 16:25.667
I mean,
I spend all my time here,

16:25.733 --> 16:28.900

16:29.667 --> 16:31.333

16:31.400 --> 16:34.067
Oh, so I can record
oink-oink here?

16:35.933 --> 16:38.500
-What?

16:38.567 --> 16:40.067
It's all yours.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.067
I don't follow.

16:42.133 --> 16:44.133

My other boss?

16:58.467 --> 17:00.767

17:00.833 --> 17:04.467
Uh, Mr. Hutchins. Welcome to
the Memphis Recording Service.

17:04.533 --> 17:05.633
What can we do for you?

17:07.167 --> 17:08.867
Well, actually,
I'm here to see Marion.

17:08.933 --> 17:12.100
But if I've come
at an inopportune time,

17:12.167 --> 17:14.233
-I could just come back...
-Not at all.

17:18.600 --> 17:19.933
Well, then...

17:21.067 --> 17:22.533
-Oh.
-I...

17:23.633 --> 17:26.167
-I was, uh,

17:26.233 --> 17:30.100
wondering if you were
free for dinner this evening?

17:31.867 --> 17:34.333
Well, I am actually.

17:36.633 --> 17:39.233
Uh, Marion,

17:39.300 --> 17:41.667
we have a recording
session tonight.

17:41.733 --> 17:43.367
Do we?

17:43.433 --> 17:47.467
Oh, well, I'm sure
you can handle it, Sam.

17:47.533 --> 17:48.967
Single-handedly.

17:51.300 --> 17:54.200
-Let me walk you out.
-I would love that.

17:54.733 --> 17:56.067
Sam.

17:56.067 --> 17:58.567
-Was a pleasure.
-So long.

18:02.567 --> 18:05.633
Do you think I should mention
my finger-licking baby backs?

18:05.700 --> 18:07.067
They are something!

18:07.833 --> 18:09.100
Sure.

Aye, aye, Captain.
You can count on me.

Now, I've told you to see me
right after the show.

you had skedaddled

21:27.233 --> 21:28.967

21:30.200 --> 21:31.233
Now, go on, get. Go on!

21:32.767 --> 21:35.100
The Colonel is always working
extra hard to sell

21:35.167 --> 21:37.800

-Thank you.
You're welcome.

21:54.200 --> 21:55.767
Would you like to order?

21:55.833 --> 21:57.233
-I'll have...
-The lady will have

21:57.300 --> 21:58.800
a Waldorf salad to begin,

21:58.867 --> 22:00.233
and for the main course,

22:00.300 --> 22:02.467
the, uh, coq au vin

22:02.533 --> 22:05.800

22:17.567 --> 22:20.800
-Sidecar.
-Right away, sir.

Thank you, ma'am.

22:24.067 --> 22:25.733
So...

22:25.800 --> 22:28.933
Did you, uh, grow up
here in Memphis?

22:29.067 --> 22:32.533
Born and raised.

22:32.600 --> 22:34.067
Graduated Southwestern College.

22:34.133 --> 22:37.333
Went to Nashville for a time,
but now I'm back here.

22:37.400 --> 22:39.800
So, what did you study
in school?

22:39.867 --> 22:41.600
Medieval French.

22:43.100 --> 22:44.533
You don't say.

22:45.733 --> 22:47.100
Absolument.

22:47.167 --> 22:50.333
It's some of the most romantic
literature ever written.

22:51.400 --> 22:52.900
You don't say.

22:55.800 --> 22:59.267
There's a beautiful story
of Tristan and Isolde.

22:59.333 --> 23:01.533
He was a handsome knight
sent to Ireland

23:01.600 --> 23:04.500
to retrieve her
to become King Mark's wife,

23:05.800 --> 23:07.500
but the two drank
a love potion,

23:07.567 --> 23:09.933
and alone in the woods...

23:10.067 --> 23:11.567
You can imagine.

23:13.233 --> 23:14.833
I certainly can.

23:52.367 --> 23:54.433
Did you have a nice time?

23:56.200 --> 23:58.467
I did, actually.

23:58.533 --> 24:02.367
Earle's educated,
respectful, and stable.

24:02.433 --> 24:04.367

24:06.567 --> 24:08.333
Is that right?

24:09.567 --> 24:11.967
You know what I need, Marion?

24:13.333 --> 24:15.800
You really don't want me
to answer that.

24:15.867 --> 24:18.533
I need someone

24:18.600 --> 24:22.500
who does the administrating
of this studio,

24:23.600 --> 24:27.367
to be here
when I'm doing sessions!

24:27.433 --> 24:28.667
Do you know
where I could find me

24:28.733 --> 24:31.067
someone like that, Marion?

24:31.100 --> 24:33.733
Only if you can find someone
to produce the sessions

24:33.800 --> 24:35.600
when I'm doing
the administrating.

24:35.667 --> 24:38.233
Which seems to be more
my problem than yours lately.

24:38.300 --> 24:39.967
Aw, come on,

24:40.067 --> 24:42.867

all that administrating be?

we got enough acetates,

24:48.667 --> 24:50.867
tape stock, office supplies,

24:50.933 --> 24:53.333
while making sure
there's fresh coffee,

24:53.400 --> 24:55.833
not to mention
cleaning the filthy toilets?

but makes sure
we got enough in the bank,

25:15.567 --> 25:17.933
and deals with the bill
collectors when we don't?

which I'm doing to help you?

Screwing your second job's
boss part of helping me?

25:29.200 --> 25:32.533

-That we were, Daddy.

28:50.533 --> 28:51.733
Well, Peggy May,

28:51.800 --> 28:54.967
you can discuss it with
Jimmy's cousin now, too.

28:55.067 --> 28:57.300
'Cause brother Jerry Lee here
just enrolled

28:57.367 --> 29:01.133
in the Waxahachie
Texas Bible Institute

29:01.200 --> 29:04.800
on the righteous path
to becoming an associate

29:04.867 --> 29:06.900
of my humble ministry.

29:06.967 --> 29:08.833
-Praise Jesus.
-Praise Jesus!

29:08.900 --> 29:10.467
Praise Jesus.

29:11.600 --> 29:12.800
Praise Jesus!

29:12.867 --> 29:14.900
-Amen.
-Amen.

29:15.567 --> 29:16.533
Amen.

29:16.600 --> 29:18.067
Amen.

29:28.067 --> 29:31.600
Sam had some
incidents of anxiety,

29:31.667 --> 29:34.067
and deep depression
back in Nashville.

29:35.333 --> 29:37.167
The pills seemed to help
but then,

29:37.233 --> 29:38.400
with the move to Memphis,

29:38.467 --> 29:41.067
and the stress
of the new business,

29:41.133 --> 29:43.933
he's been drinking,
staying out late,

29:44.067 --> 29:46.433
he crashed his car
the other night, and...

29:46.500 --> 29:49.500
The pills stop me
from thinking, Doc.

29:50.300 --> 29:52.200
There is another option.

29:52.267 --> 29:55.567
It's a new procedure called
electroconvulsive therapy.

29:56.767 --> 29:58.833
Zapping my noggin?

29:58.900 --> 30:03.467
-I don't know about that, Sam.
-It sounds worse than it is.

30:03.533 --> 30:06.467
The brain
has electrical impulses,

30:06.533 --> 30:10.200
and ECT short-circuits
those brain waves

30:10.267 --> 30:11.667
that cause this anxiety.

30:12.900 --> 30:14.167
Huh.

30:17.733 --> 30:19.533
I gotta get my head straight.

30:22.667 --> 30:24.533
Look, uh, I drink

30:24.600 --> 30:29.400
to relax,
but then I do ungodly things.

30:29.467 --> 30:33.500
Now, one night, me and a buddy
agreed to press up 300 records

30:33.567 --> 30:36.600
and damn it
if I ain't got 289 left.

30:39.600 --> 30:41.067
A souvenir.

30:47.900 --> 30:49.300
Oh, hell, Doc...

30:52.633 --> 30:55.167
Cure me or kill me.

30:55.233 --> 30:57.100
You're not having
your brain zapped.

30:59.067 --> 31:01.167
That's final, Sam Phillips.

31:02.867 --> 31:04.067
Well, then,

31:05.200 --> 31:07.433
you heard Mrs. Phillips, Doc.

31:10.400 --> 31:12.967
Might as well give me
some more of them pills.

31:21.200 --> 31:22.933
I don't know what to do, Mama.

31:23.067 --> 31:25.567
I talked to her daddy,
he said it's all right,

31:25.633 --> 31:27.600
thinks I'm a good kid.

31:27.667 --> 31:29.733
You should keep your mind
on your studies,

31:31.067 --> 31:33.400
but I can see
you're keen on this girl.

31:33.467 --> 31:36.133
It ain't her daddy whose heart

31:36.200 --> 31:37.633
you're trying to win.

31:41.533 --> 31:43.367
I just don't know
what to do, Mama.

31:43.433 --> 31:45.433
Now, pumpkin,
don't you fret none.

31:45.500 --> 31:47.067
I'm gonna give you
some guidance

31:47.100 --> 31:48.733
from the female perspective.

31:50.933 --> 31:52.400
Now your daddy,

31:52.467 --> 31:55.200
he's had his setbacks
over the years,

31:55.267 --> 31:59.100
out of work,
that little time away from us.

31:59.167 --> 32:02.767
But back when
he was your age...

32:04.967 --> 32:06.467
He was quite the ladies' man.

32:08.167 --> 32:10.200
He took a shine to me

32:10.267 --> 32:13.667
and did the three things
he needed to win my heart.

32:13.733 --> 32:15.100
Like what?

32:15.167 --> 32:17.633
First, get a after school job.

32:17.700 --> 32:20.267
Girl likes a man
to wine and dine her some.

32:21.400 --> 32:23.467
Oh, that sounds awful fancy.

32:23.533 --> 32:26.067
Pumpkin, that's what's called
a figure of speech.

32:26.133 --> 32:29.133
Earn some pocket money,
you take her to the A&W.

32:29.200 --> 32:31.767

32:31.833 --> 32:35.067

the want ads?

32:35.133 --> 32:36.633
I'm busy here.

32:39.067 --> 32:41.467
Second, what's she like?

32:41.533 --> 32:42.867
Well, the last time I checked,

32:42.933 --> 32:44.333
it was the captain
of the basketball team...

32:45.767 --> 32:48.333
And, well, I ain't no good
at dribbling a ball.

32:48.400 --> 32:51.200

43:07.333 --> 43:09.367
No, no, no. No.

43:09.433 --> 43:11.533
I have to stay.
I would like to stay...

43:11.600 --> 43:13.933
Can I please just stay?

43:16.600 --> 43:20.067
♪ Believe me

43:20.100 --> 43:26.633
♪ From the bottom
of my heart, dear

43:28.167 --> 43:31.900
♪ I apologize

43:34.833 --> 43:41.767
♪ I realize I've been
unfair to you.

43:41.833 --> 43:46.967
♪ Please let me make amends

43:49.733 --> 43:55.433
♪ Don't say you forgot
the love we knew

43:55.500 --> 44:01.533
♪ After all
we were more than friends

44:04.400 --> 44:06.833
♪ If I made you blue

44:07.800 --> 44:11.267
♪ I've had heartaches, too

44:11.333 --> 44:13.500
♪ Now, I beg of you

44:13.567 --> 44:18.167

44:18.233 --> 44:24.833

of my heart, dear

44:26.167 --> 44:32.967

44:40.400 --> 44:41.600
Next time on
Sun Records...

44:41.667 --> 44:43.367
That's Johnny Bragg.

44:43.433 --> 44:45.233
Six consecutive
life sentences.

44:45.300 --> 44:47.700
I will die in Birmingham!

44:47.767 --> 44:50.233
And I will die here.

44:50.300 --> 44:51.833
Is you Dewey Phillips?

44:51.900 --> 44:53.700
Smitty, I
realize the debt is now 1,200

44:53.767 --> 44:56.833
and you will have another
50 tomorrow as promised.

44:56.900 --> 44:58.600
Think about
what it'd look like

44:58.667 --> 45:00.167
with your first hit on it.

45:00.233 --> 45:02.300
-What'd you say your name is?
-Uh, Elvis Presley.

45:02.367 --> 45:04.667
Let's lay one down for real.

45:04.733 --> 45:06.067
It's time for us
to be together.

45:06.100 --> 45:08.533
Sam and me
are gonna have another baby.
