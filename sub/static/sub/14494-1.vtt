<i>Tracking signal located.</i>

00:03.301 --> 00:06.300
<i>Location-- the Gerlach
Mountain Range, Slovakia.</i>

00:06.301 --> 00:07.801
Switch to infrared.

00:08.502 --> 00:09.802
Got them.

00:17.603 --> 00:20.603
Just tell us
that there is need,
Miss Von Bardas,

00:20.604 --> 00:23.404
and AIM can supply you
with anything you desire.

00:23.405 --> 00:27.205
With any one of our weapons,
you can crush an army.

00:28.906 --> 00:31.606
[Iron Man]
Well, good thing
I didn't bring an army then.

00:37.607 --> 00:39.407
Wow, quite a sale
you've got going on here.

00:39.408 --> 00:41.108
A lot of neat stuff.

00:41.109 --> 00:44.509
Unfortunately, some of it
has my name on it.

00:47.210 --> 00:50.910
You know, for calling yourselves
the Advanced Idea Mechanics,

00:50.911 --> 00:52.911
that was a really bad idea.

00:54.000 --> 01:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:03.613 --> 01:05.613
Give your master
a message for me.

01:05.614 --> 01:08.814
Buyer beware.
You steal my tech,
you answer to me.

01:09.315 --> 01:11.015
Even him.

01:15.616 --> 01:17.716
Jarvis, contact the Vault.

01:17.717 --> 01:19.817
Let them know they're about
to get a few new guests.
[Men gasping]

01:19.818 --> 01:22.818
<i>Very well, sir.
Also, Miss Potts called.</i>

01:21.719 --> 01:24.719
<i>She wished to know if you were
still out playing superhero,</i>

01:24.720 --> 01:29.120
<i>or if you're going to come into
 the office to do some actual work.</i>

02:47.936 --> 02:50.536
Samson-- Samson!

02:50.537 --> 02:52.537
You can't do this to me!
Do you hear?

02:52.538 --> 02:54.538
And how are we today,
Bruce?

02:54.539 --> 02:57.839
No episodes in the last
36 hours, I see.

02:57.840 --> 03:00.540
This is a disaster
waiting to happen, Leonard.

03:08.141 --> 03:10.241
I've told you
again and again, Bruce.

03:10.242 --> 03:12.242
We'll find a cure
for the Hulk.

03:12.243 --> 03:15.243
The Cube is
the most advanced

03:17.944 --> 03:21.144
gamma radiation
research facility on the planet.

03:21.145 --> 03:23.245
The work we've done with Sterns
and Blonsky is--

03:23.246 --> 03:25.346
You're wrong.
SHIELD and Ross
are lying to you.

03:25.347 --> 03:27.347
They don't want cures.
They want to know how
to control these monsters.

03:27.348 --> 03:30.648
Trust me,
I've seen it happen.

03:30.649 --> 03:31.949
They will twist everything
you do.

03:33.350 --> 03:36.350
You wanna know what
the Cube is really?

03:36.351 --> 03:38.351
It's a gamma bomb
waiting to go off.

03:38.352 --> 03:42.052
Hail, Thor Odinson.

03:42.053 --> 03:45.053
Hail, Balder the Brave.

03:45.054 --> 03:48.354
What brings Asgard's
shining light to Midgard.

03:48.355 --> 03:49.955
Or is the better question,
who sent you?

03:49.956 --> 03:52.956
You father has entered
the Odin sleep.

03:52.957 --> 03:54.957
But before he faded to dream,
he asked me to bring you home

03:56.805 --> 03:58.154
to defend Asgard while Odin
replenishes his power.

03:59.559 --> 04:01.159
Nay.

04:01.160 --> 04:04.460
Thor, you are like
a brother to me.

04:15.361 --> 04:17.361
We have fought wars together,

04:17.362 --> 04:21.362
but I do not understand
your connection to this place.

04:21.363 --> 04:24.263
Here I can make a difference.

04:26.064 --> 04:28.064
In Asgard,
the endless cycle of fighting--

04:28.065 --> 04:30.365
it is meaningless.

04:30.366 --> 04:33.966
On Earth,
everything matters.

04:33.967 --> 04:36.167
[siren wailing]
I am needed here, Balder.

04:36.168 --> 04:37.768
Drone?

04:39.169 --> 04:40.469
Good news is
you're gonna live.

04:47.470 --> 04:50.470
The bad news--
you better get used
to taking the subway.

04:50.471 --> 04:52.071
[engine revving,
tires screeching]

04:58.872 --> 05:02.372
[gasps]

05:02.373 --> 05:05.073
Are you all right,
Jane Foster?

05:05.074 --> 05:07.574
I-- I-- Yeah.

05:07.575 --> 05:09.175
You-- You just saved...

05:09.176 --> 05:11.676
Hey, have you
been following me?

05:11.677 --> 05:14.177
Uh, perhaps.

05:14.178 --> 05:16.178
You intrigue me.

05:16.179 --> 05:18.179
Mortal lives--
they are so fragile.
[muffled yell]

05:18.180 --> 05:21.680
Yet you do not seem
to accept that.

05:21.681 --> 05:23.281
Would you?

05:23.282 --> 05:25.282
Nay.

05:25.283 --> 05:27.283
<i>[on radio]
Iron Man, this is Jimmy Woo
with Vault security.</i>

05:34.284 --> 05:37.784
<i>You are clear for landing.</i>

05:37.785 --> 05:39.785
Thanks. AIM's been a thorn
in SHIELD's side
for a long time.

05:39.786 --> 05:44.086
Yeah, well, helping SHIELD's
not on my "to do" list.

05:44.087 --> 05:46.087
These guys are dangerous.
They had my tech.

05:46.088 --> 05:47.888
I took them down.
End of story.

05:47.889 --> 05:50.689
Right. Well,
while you're here,

05:50.690 --> 05:52.990
I wanted to talk
Vault security with you.

05:52.991 --> 05:54.591
We had an incident
last week.

05:55.692 --> 05:58.692
Did Fury
put you up to this?

05:58.693 --> 06:01.293
No. This isn't about weapons.

06:01.294 --> 06:04.594
This is about containment.
It's about keeping people safe.

06:04.595 --> 06:06.595
Okay, schedule something
with Pepper.

06:10.196 --> 06:12.096
Whatever it is,
I'm sure it can wait a day.

06:12.097 --> 06:14.097
[Hank]
I wanted to ask you a question,
uh, Mr.--

06:14.098 --> 06:15.398
[Man]
"Mad Thinker" will suffice.

06:15.399 --> 06:17.699
Okay. A SHIELD-monitered
conversation you had
with Whirlwind.

06:17.700 --> 06:19.700
You said something
was going to happen.

06:21.901 --> 06:23.201
We'd like to know what.

07:14.902 --> 07:16.602
Can you not feel it,
Ant-Man?

07:16.603 --> 07:18.303
The better question
is not "what," but "when"?

07:52.904 --> 07:56.404
Director Fury's offer
was very serious, Wasp.

07:56.405 --> 07:58.705
Hank--
Ant-Man is against it.

07:58.706 --> 08:00.306
And you?

08:00.307 --> 08:02.807
I wanna help.
I wanna do more.

08:02.808 --> 08:04.608
SHIELD will let you
do more.

08:04.609 --> 08:07.309
Who was that?

08:07.310 --> 08:11.610
That's classified.

08:11.611 --> 08:14.111
[scoffs]
On second thought,

08:42.511 --> 08:44.512
SHIELD might be
a little too dramatic for me.

08:46.813 --> 08:49.513
Everything's always
so serious.

08:49.514 --> 08:52.514
Kind of like that.

08:53.315 --> 08:56.815
[door opens]

08:56.816 --> 08:59.316
[growling]

08:59.317 --> 09:00.617
No.

09:00.618 --> 09:03.605
Boom.

09:03.606 --> 09:06.263
Someone get to engineering.
Tell them the keep us in the air.

09:06.264 --> 09:08.620
And shut off that alarm!

09:08.621 --> 09:11.821
Director Fury, a report
just came in from the Vault.

09:11.822 --> 09:14.322
Do I look like I have time
for this, Quartermain?

09:14.323 --> 09:16.623
Listen to me! Sir,

09:16.624 --> 09:18.224
automated reports are coming in
from the Vault and the Cube.

09:18.225 --> 09:21.225
Their systems
have gone offline,

09:21.226 --> 09:23.226
and no one is responding
from down at the Big House.

09:23.927 --> 09:26.927
Something is seriously wrong.

09:26.928 --> 09:28.428
[roars]

09:28.429 --> 09:32.729
[grunts]

09:34.730 --> 09:37.730
[laughing]
Payback time.

09:37.731 --> 09:40.031
This is crazy.
How did this happen?

09:40.032 --> 09:42.532
It doesn't matter.
Right now, we have to
get to the bridge.

09:44.533 --> 09:47.833
No. Ant-Man was in the Big House
when the explosion happened.

09:47.834 --> 09:50.334
He was with
all the super villains.

09:50.335 --> 09:54.335
We have to help him, now!

09:54.336 --> 09:57.336
<i>[Jarvis]
Incoming call. Potts, Pepper.</i>

09:57.337 --> 09:59.837
Pepper, guess who I ticked off
this morning.

09:59.838 --> 10:03.838
Here's a hint.
His name rhymes with "boom."

10:05.439 --> 10:08.739
<i>Tony, something's happened
at the SHIELD helicarrier.</i>

10:08.740 --> 10:11.740
<i>Some kind of explosion.
Tony, it's bad.</i>

10:11.741 --> 10:14.241
<i>Sir, there appears to be
a problem at the Vault.</i>

10:14.242 --> 10:16.742
<i>They have stopped
transmitting data.</i>

10:16.743 --> 10:19.243
All right, Pepper.
Keep monitoring
the helicarrier situation.

10:26.244 --> 10:29.771
I'm gonna check
on something here.

10:29.772 --> 10:31.272
[Jane]
So your dad--
he sleeps for a week?

10:37.949 --> 10:40.445
The Odin sleep.

10:44.781 --> 10:46.233
Once a year,
he replenishes his power

10:46.234 --> 10:49.013
which in turn gives life
to Asgard.

10:49.014 --> 10:51.237
Wow. Must be some sleep.

10:51.238 --> 10:53.437
Indeed.
But during this time,

10:53.438 --> 10:55.217
Asgard is vulnerable
to attack.

10:56.233 --> 10:59.511
So, why aren't you there?

10:59.512 --> 11:02.469
This seems to be
a popular question.

11:02.470 --> 11:04.656
It is complicated.

11:04.657 --> 11:07.202
Really? Because it sounds like
you're just mad at your dad.

11:28.880 --> 11:30.380
There's nothing less complicated
than that.

11:43.080 --> 11:46.151
The mortals, you...

11:54.558 --> 11:56.656
I am needed here.

12:01.094 --> 12:02.594
You know, we have managed
to survive okay.

12:19.637 --> 12:21.961
We've got police,
firemen, paramedics,

12:21.962 --> 12:23.688
even a few superheroes
of our own.

12:45.833 --> 12:48.188
Take a week off.
Help the family.

12:48.189 --> 12:50.725
Earth will still be here
when you get back.

12:54.380 --> 12:55.880
[explosion]

13:04.906 --> 13:06.406
What was it
you were saying about
the Earth still being here?

13:46.086 --> 13:48.462
TouchÃ©.

13:48.463 --> 13:50.254
Come on. Come on!

13:50.255 --> 13:51.755
[strains]
Leonard?

14:03.979 --> 14:06.979
What's-- Oh, no. No!

14:07.814 --> 14:10.508
Leonard,
you've gotta listen to me.

14:10.509 --> 14:12.352
You've been exposed
to gamma radiation.

14:19.197 --> 14:22.531
We have to get you
to a hospital.

14:22.532 --> 14:24.183
[grunts]
You were right.

14:24.184 --> 14:28.134
The prisoners--
they're all free.

14:28.135 --> 14:29.677
It's a disaster.

14:29.678 --> 14:31.559
Listen to me, Leonard.

14:31.560 --> 14:33.507
You have to help me,
because right now

14:33.508 --> 14:35.890
the Hulk is
the only hope we've got.

14:36.716 --> 14:38.094
[grunts]

14:38.095 --> 14:40.290

Come on in, boys.
Store's open.

14:47.518 --> 14:50.224
[yells]
I don't think so, dirt bag.

14:52.166 --> 14:53.666
Oh, nuts!

15:59.335 --> 16:04.643
<i>This course of action

will be subdued now.</i>

16:13.365 --> 16:15.954

16:15.955 --> 16:18.822
This is really disappointing,
Mandrill.

16:19.668 --> 16:21.336
And you've come so far
in counseling.

16:24.745 --> 16:27.284
[screeches]
Disappointing.

17:22.905 --> 17:24.742
Get up, Stark.
We're not done.

17:24.742 --> 17:26.385
All right, guys.
We all know how
this is going to end,

17:26.386 --> 17:27.848
super-villain team-up or not.

Actually--

Iron Man--
Hey--

17:50.798 --> 17:54.084
long has the Crimson Dynamo
waited for this.

17:54.085 --> 17:56.779
Okay, this is a problem.

17:56.780 --> 17:58.280
Jarvis, hack into
the SHIELD frequency.

18:00.667 --> 18:02.753
Give the evac order.
[groans]

18:10.023 --> 18:13.032
I want all SHIELD agents
out of the Vault right now.

18:13.033 --> 18:15.015
Director Fury,
the Big House
is wide open, sir.

18:18.586 --> 18:21.047
Prisoners are reported
on all levels.

18:21.048 --> 18:23.156
Our agents are engaging,
but-- but, sir,

18:29.523 --> 18:32.171
containment is at 0%.

18:32.172 --> 18:33.941
Forget about the Big House.
Our priority is the raft.

19:44.595 --> 19:47.158
The fourth prison.

19:47.801 --> 19:50.874
[screaming]

20:09.054 --> 20:13.009
Whatever occurred
here in the Cube

20:13.010 --> 20:14.858
seems to have occurred
at the Vault

20:14.859 --> 20:17.144
and at the Big House as well.

20:17.808 --> 20:19.882
Intriguing.

20:19.883 --> 20:21.383
Yeah. It's a mystery.

20:31.065 --> 20:32.447
So how about we just get
the heck out of here?

20:32.448 --> 20:35.133
Leave? Why would we
ever leave here?

20:58.374 --> 21:00.372
This is where
I am going to change

21:00.373 --> 21:01.993
the world.

21:14.231 --> 21:16.043
[Hulk roaring, distant]

18:32.822 --> 18:35.657
Our old friend.

18:35.691 --> 18:38.860
Go. Deal with the Hulk

18:38.895 --> 18:41.363
once and for all.

18:46.636 --> 18:47.736
Agent Woo to Iron Man.

18:47.770 --> 18:49.371
All SHIELD personnel
are clear.

18:49.405 --> 18:52.207
I repeat, we are clear.
Now get out of there, Tony.

18:52.241 --> 18:54.142
[grunts]

18:54.177 --> 18:55.777
I'm working on that, Jimmy.

18:55.811 --> 18:58.880
I remember when you
put me away here, Iron man.

18:58.915 --> 19:03.552
I remember what I told myself
I do if I ever saw you again.

19:03.586 --> 19:08.190
Ah. Let me guess.
Bore me to death?

19:10.459 --> 19:12.294
[screaming]

19:25.274 --> 19:29.511
Jarvis, initiate take over
of all Vault systems.

19:31.080 --> 19:32.847
<i>Done. Your command, sir?</i>

19:32.882 --> 19:34.649
Begin self-destruct sequence.

19:34.684 --> 19:35.884
<i>Beginning countdown.</i>

19:35.918 --> 19:38.954
<i>10, 9, 8, 7--</i>

19:38.988 --> 19:40.388
Just skip to the end!

19:40.423 --> 19:42.257
Wait, where is he going?

19:46.128 --> 19:47.829
[screams]

19:55.538 --> 19:57.439
Give me an update, Jarvis.

19:57.473 --> 19:58.773
<i>According to SHIELD
communications,</i>

19:58.808 --> 20:00.208
<i>There is a breakout event</i>

20:00.243 --> 20:02.110
<i>happening at the Cube
as well.</i>

20:02.144 --> 20:04.713
<i>And the Helicarrier
has crashed in New York Bay</i>

20:04.747 --> 20:06.448
<i>and is currently sinking.</i>

20:06.482 --> 20:09.017
[groans]

20:09.051 --> 20:11.152
I'm gonna need
a fresh suit of armor.

20:18.494 --> 20:21.196
And then I'm gonna
find the bug girl

20:21.230 --> 20:22.631
and tear her apart.

20:27.003 --> 20:29.437
I'd let you tell
the Wasp yourself,

20:29.472 --> 20:32.007
but you're about
to get knocked out.

20:38.381 --> 20:39.581
So how's your day been?

20:39.615 --> 20:40.715
Painful.

20:40.750 --> 20:43.585
I don't think it's over yet.

21:15.651 --> 21:16.885
[laughs]

21:24.927 --> 21:27.329
[roars]

21:27.363 --> 21:29.698
[groans]

21:52.922 --> 21:54.789
Come on, Blonsky, let's go--

21:54.824 --> 21:56.291
No.

21:56.325 --> 21:59.694
Abomination, Absorbing Man,
do not follow him.

21:59.729 --> 22:03.064
Let the Hulk go.

22:03.099 --> 22:07.469
We have work to do.

22:15.044 --> 22:17.045
You're acting director
till I get back, Hill.

22:17.079 --> 22:18.613
Save who you can.

22:18.647 --> 22:21.249
Contain any escapees you see.

22:21.283 --> 22:23.251
I'll update you from the Raft.

22:23.285 --> 22:25.754
<i>And if the Raft prisoners
are free?</i>

22:25.788 --> 22:29.190
Then you should enjoy being
acting director while you can.

22:39.235 --> 22:41.970
Look alive, boys.
Shoot first,

22:42.004 --> 22:43.204
ask questions later.

22:43.239 --> 22:44.639
[ship groans]

23:06.829 --> 23:08.696
Evac now. Abort the mission.

23:08.731 --> 23:09.831
Everyone off this barge.

23:09.865 --> 23:12.000
[power pulses]

23:12.034 --> 23:13.301
[screams]

23:21.677 --> 23:23.011
Graviton.
