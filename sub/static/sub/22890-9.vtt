waded in the penis pond?

00:11.000 --> 00:12.667
- Yeah, I do.

00:12.700 --> 00:15.567

want to get into event planning

gonna get into arguments

know the way you talk to me

00:26.667 --> 00:29.433

- Mm-hmm.

00:29.433 --> 00:31.166
- My name is Kelsey Patel.

00:31.166 --> 00:34.433
I am a reiki master

00:34.433 --> 00:36.266
All right, you're up.

00:36.300 --> 00:37.533
a great relationship
for the last two years,

00:37.567 --> 00:39.400
and I ----ed it up.

00:39.433 --> 00:43.066

make anybody else happy.

00:43.100 --> 00:45.133
You have to start

- So I want us

01:45.133 --> 01:47.066
- Yes.

01:47.100 --> 01:48.734
"Beverly Hills
Lifestyle Magazine"

01:48.767 --> 01:50.633
since the first issue.

01:50.633 --> 01:53.700
So I'm honored and flattered
to take over the helm.

01:53.734 --> 01:55.767
I mean, this is
an important event to me.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.767
So I want this party

01:58.000 --> 01:59.500
I want it to go

01:59.533 --> 02:03.333
- I will assure you that
everything will go perfectly.

02:03.367 --> 02:04.667
- If it doesn't,

02:04.700 --> 02:06.333
I look like the idiot, not you.
- Yes.

02:06.367 --> 02:07.767
And I don't want
to look like an idiot.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.400
- I don't want to make you
look like an idiot.

02:09.400 --> 02:11.266
- Now on music,
I was thinking.

02:11.266 --> 02:13.200
Do you think you're still going
to be able to do

02:13.233 --> 02:15.667
"See You Next Tuesday"?
- Yes, we have to.

02:15.700 --> 02:18.100
- There are other DJs
in this town.

02:18.133 --> 02:19.667
- I can do both parties,
for sure.

02:19.667 --> 02:21.500
- Okay, good, but listen.

02:21.533 --> 02:23.533
I want all my guests
to have a great time.

02:23.567 --> 02:26.667

Let me worry.

02:26.667 --> 02:28.266
- Now, that worries me.

02:28.266 --> 02:29.667
All right,
I'll see you tomorrow.

02:29.667 --> 02:31.233
- All right, thank you.
- Thanks, Lisa.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.667
I'm scared.
- I'm a little scared

02:34.700 --> 02:36.667
for you, honestly.
- Okay, so you're going to

02:36.667 --> 02:38.734
bring your speakers,
your "wika-wikas"...

02:38.767 --> 02:40.266
- Yeah, all the
"wika-wika" stuff.

If you want to

02:41.767 --> 02:43.266
bring your boyfriend,
you can bring him too.

02:43.300 --> 02:45.033
- Where did you hear
something like that?

02:45.066 --> 02:47.300
- Brittany said that Logan
told her sister that.

02:47.333 --> 02:50.433
- Logan told me last night
that he's sleeping with James.

02:52.567 --> 02:54.567
- Jesus Christ.

02:54.600 --> 02:57.033
Absolutely not.

02:57.033 --> 02:58.533
- She's pissed.

02:58.567 --> 03:00.567
- So your boyfriend
won't be coming tomorrow?

03:00.567 --> 03:02.266

If I wanted to go kiss a guy

I'm not gay, though.
And that's just it.

03:09.333 --> 03:11.300
I don't need to prove myself.

so wish me luck.

Our suits were awesome.

When my brothers came up

it was such
a momentous occasion for them.

04:02.500 --> 04:04.600
They had never been
to California, you know?

04:04.633 --> 04:06.734
My brothers are coming to town.
Little sightseeing.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.633
- We want to get them
looking awesome.

04:08.633 --> 04:10.166
- Freshen up their looks.

04:10.200 --> 04:11.500
It had been a long time

04:11.533 --> 04:14.300
since they had
even been on a plane.

it feels good to like,

04:15.767 --> 04:17.500
have a little swagger
in your step, you know?

04:17.533 --> 04:19.300
- Yes, exactly.
- Like when you look

04:19.333 --> 04:20.633
in the mirror and you're like,
"Damn, I look good."

04:20.667 --> 04:22.233
- Yes.
- This is going to be great.

04:22.266 --> 04:25.567
Now I can do an even more
extensive makeover

04:25.600 --> 04:28.100
than I did for them

- Yeah.

04:33.266 --> 04:34.767

- One of the main reasons

04:34.767 --> 04:36.734
my brothers haven't
came out and visited yet

04:36.767 --> 04:39.767
is that in the past,
Katie might have been

04:40.000 --> 04:42.467
a little more hesitant
to have them stay with us.

04:42.500 --> 04:44.100
- Did you get them
a place to stay,

04:44.133 --> 04:45.734
or what's the
arrangements going to be?

04:45.767 --> 04:47.066

I think I'm going

04:47.100 --> 04:48.533
to have them stay with us.

04:48.567 --> 04:50.066
I know it's going to be
a little crowded.

04:50.100 --> 04:52.066
They can see where we live.

04:52.100 --> 04:53.767
- They'll like that.

Katie has been so cool.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.500

It's like she went
from being tequila Katie

05:01.667 --> 05:03.400
to like, chamomile tea Katie.

05:03.400 --> 05:05.266
Bubba, look at this.
- Aw.

05:05.300 --> 05:07.333

just so I can see him in this.

05:07.367 --> 05:08.734
- Let's have a kid.

05:08.767 --> 05:10.533
- With the triplets
coming to visit,

05:10.567 --> 05:12.467
it's going to be challenging.
Tom has a habit

05:12.500 --> 05:15.100
of opening a Coors Light,
having about four sips

05:15.133 --> 05:17.200
out of it, setting it down.
So by the end of the night,

05:17.233 --> 05:20.400
there's just 20 half-drank
Coors Lights everywhere.

05:20.433 --> 05:22.533
So now, times that by three.

08:37.300 --> 08:39.667
that,
I'm taking them off.

08:39.700 --> 08:42.367
- All right, I'm lighting
some palo santo, so we can--

08:42.400 --> 08:44.166
What the  is that?

08:44.166 --> 08:46.433
- It's like sage in a way.
It just is calming.

08:46.433 --> 08:48.667
Yeah, it works.

08:48.700 --> 08:50.567
- I can do this.
- Yes.

08:50.600 --> 08:52.266
- Seriously.

08:52.300 --> 08:55.166
Welcome to
"Straight Up with Stassi."

08:55.200 --> 08:58.033
I have someone that I've
just recently gotten to know.

08:58.033 --> 09:01.266
And I heard her give a speech.
It was so moving.

09:01.300 --> 09:03.266
- Coming up...

09:03.300 --> 09:05.700
- It's a bad situation. I don't
think we can open tonight.

09:05.734 --> 09:07.600
It's a disaster right now.

09:17.633 --> 09:19.467
- Are you excited
to see uncles?

09:19.467 --> 09:22.467
Uncle Billy, and Uncle Brandon,
and Uncle Burt?

09:25.166 --> 09:28.600
All the boys.
I'm outnumbered.

09:28.600 --> 09:30.333
Too many boys.

09:33.433 --> 09:34.467
- Hello.

09:34.467 --> 09:36.667
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:36.700 --> 09:38.533
- We got them
some really cool stuff.

09:38.567 --> 09:41.066
- Yeah, okay.

09:41.100 --> 09:43.433
- Check these out.
- Oh yeah, those are nice.

09:43.467 --> 09:45.734
- Found a hat, one of them.
- They're never going to

09:45.767 --> 09:47.200
wear that hat.
- I know.

09:47.233 --> 09:48.500
- Yeah, they will.
- No, they won't.

09:48.500 --> 09:50.367
- If I can teach the triplets
one thing

09:50.367 --> 09:51.734
while they're here
about fashion,

09:51.767 --> 09:54.600
that is building
a good foundation.

09:54.633 --> 09:57.600
A cool pair of shoes,
nice jeans.

09:57.633 --> 10:03.600
And then rotate tops or jackets
to express your personality.

10:03.633 --> 10:06.367
- Did you guys hear that there
was, like an electrical fire

10:06.367 --> 10:07.734
at Sur last night?

10:07.767 --> 10:09.166
- Yeah.
- Where the power,

10:09.200 --> 10:11.500
whatever boxes, like, blew up.

10:11.500 --> 10:13.100
- Everybody
was like, panicking.

10:13.133 --> 10:15.066
- I would not know what to do.
- Yeah, nobody--

10:15.100 --> 10:17.233
- I would just like, freeze up.
- The smoke was like so bad

10:17.266 --> 10:19.300
that it was
getting to the point

10:19.333 --> 10:21.233
where you couldn't see your
hand in front of your face.

10:21.233 --> 10:25.500
And Jeremy runs in the kitchen,
grabs a fire extinguisher.

10:25.533 --> 10:28.600
And he essentially ends up
keeping the fire from spreading

10:28.633 --> 10:31.467
until the fire department came.
- Wow.

10:31.500 --> 10:33.633
- I text Diana,
and she said everyone was safe.

10:33.667 --> 10:36.266
- Well, I guess the number one
thing is everybody's safe.

10:36.300 --> 10:38.266
- Would you be sad
if Sur burned down?

10:38.266 --> 10:39.333
- No.

10:39.367 --> 10:43.000
- Hey-o!
- Uh-oh.

10:45.400 --> 10:46.767
- Good.
- This is really nice of you.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.233
- Hi, Billy.

10:48.266 --> 10:51.333
- I'm good, welcome.
Welcome!

10:53.100 --> 10:56.000
- I got you guys underwear.
- Oh, my God.

10:56.033 --> 10:58.266
- Oh!
- We got shoes.

10:58.266 --> 11:01.100
Um, I think today, we'll go
more for like a summer look.

11:01.133 --> 11:02.767
I got this right here,

11:03.000 --> 11:04.700
that I think will look good
with this white shirt.

11:04.700 --> 11:06.233
- You didn't have to do
any of this, man.

11:06.266 --> 11:08.166
This is so nice
of you, you know?

11:08.166 --> 11:09.567
- When I first met Schwartz,
I mean, he hadn't had a haircut

11:09.567 --> 11:11.567
in three months,
he didn't have any clothes.

11:11.567 --> 11:14.233
I got him freshened up, and
I mean look at the guy now.

11:14.266 --> 11:16.000
He's a stud.

11:16.033 --> 11:18.433
It's the not-so-extreme
makeover, triplet edition.

11:18.467 --> 11:20.567
All right?
- You guys are going to

11:20.567 --> 11:22.367
go back to Yulee,
and everyone's going to be

11:22.400 --> 11:24.000
like, who are those guys?
- Yeah, you guys are going to

11:24.033 --> 11:26.033
be ----ing pimping.
- Yeah, looking fresh.

11:26.033 --> 11:27.567
- The only problem is,
I don't want to go back.

11:27.600 --> 11:29.700
- They're moving in, dude!
- Oh, God, come on.

11:31.400 --> 11:32.767
- I'll--I'll cook.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.567
- He makes a mean
boxed mac and cheese.

11:34.600 --> 11:38.166
- I don't mind having a house
guest for a night or two.

11:38.200 --> 11:40.400
But having three grown dudes?

11:42.700 --> 11:44.567
- Tom better
make sure that our place

11:44.567 --> 11:47.667
does not start smelling
like socks and farts.

11:47.700 --> 11:49.333
Are you guys going
to the meeting at Sur?

11:49.367 --> 11:51.567
- Yeah, I think we've got a
meeting at--

11:51.600 --> 11:54.066
- Yeah, I was told about it,
but I mean, I'm just wondering

11:54.100 --> 11:55.734
if it's still on.
- I asked Diana

11:55.734 --> 11:57.533
if the power's back on
and she didn't know, I mean...

11:57.567 --> 12:00.000
- I don't think it is.
- Well, Stassi just texted me,

12:00.033 --> 12:01.333
she said,
"hey, do you mind bartending

12:01.333 --> 12:03.200
the Beverly Hills
party tonight?"

12:03.233 --> 12:05.333

extremely desperate

12:05.367 --> 12:07.066

No.

18:19.367 --> 18:21.767
- 15 minutes.

18:21.767 --> 18:23.633
I have no bartenders.

18:23.633 --> 18:25.166
I didn't know you were here.

18:25.200 --> 18:27.233
Can you please help
set up the bar?

18:27.233 --> 18:30.200
I think it's the best idea
that y'all make them out here

18:30.233 --> 18:31.734
and then bring them back there.

18:31.767 --> 18:33.567
- Okay, I don't have anything
to make them with.

18:33.600 --> 18:37.100
- Jax is bringing, like,
the shaker and knives

18:37.100 --> 18:38.767
and all of that stuff.

18:38.767 --> 18:41.700
- I was told I was going to be
showing up to pour wine

18:41.734 --> 18:46.000
and champagne, and now I have
to make batched Big Pinkies,

18:46.000 --> 18:48.367
and I have
no bar kit, no nothing.

18:48.400 --> 18:52.633
So thank you, Stassi,
for not planning this event.

good idea to just like, have...

18:55.633 --> 18:59.266

19:15.633 --> 19:18.533

pitchers of Big Pinkies.

- What do you mean
he's not here?

20:04.033 --> 20:06.333
- He's just not here.

20:06.333 --> 20:08.400
- We've tried calling him,
he didn't answer.

20:08.433 --> 20:11.400
- I've endured a lot of crap
with Jax Taylor.

20:11.433 --> 20:13.467
But I've never had him
be rude to me.

20:13.467 --> 20:17.166
He had an obligation,
and then he has the nerve

20:17.200 --> 20:20.233
to let me down at something
that's very important to me.

20:23.033 --> 20:24.333
- Yes.
- Because Jax hasn't shown up,

20:24.333 --> 20:26.066
so please go behind the bar.

20:26.066 --> 20:28.533
- Nice of you to show up.
- Mmm, hi.

20:28.567 --> 20:30.400
- Where's your
boyfriend, Satan?

20:30.433 --> 20:33.200
- He's still at the house.

20:33.200 --> 20:35.166
The party's going on--he was
supposed to be here early.

20:35.200 --> 20:36.600
Ariana's sitting there
making these drinks--

20:36.600 --> 20:38.467
- I'm sorry,
what do you want me to do?

20:38.467 --> 20:41.133
- No, it's not your fault.
So over there we have the food

20:41.166 --> 20:43.200
and cocktails
to start tray passing.

20:43.200 --> 20:45.166
- Okay.
- Jax hasn't shown up.

20:45.200 --> 20:48.600
He's being an unreliable ass.
- Right.

20:48.633 --> 20:50.233
- So just keep
pouring drinks, okay, love?

20:50.233 --> 20:51.600
- Okay, I'll do
whatever you want.

20:51.633 --> 20:53.066
- Okay, thank you.
- Yeah.

20:57.100 --> 20:59.600
- It's a filet mignon

21:01.734 --> 21:04.066
- Why would you
show up at this time?

21:04.100 --> 21:05.734
- He got his haircut,
so I was trying to wait on him.

21:05.767 --> 21:07.433
- Getting his hair cut
is more important

21:07.467 --> 21:09.100
than showing up for an event?

21:09.100 --> 21:10.700
- Do you want me to help
Ariana with bartending?

21:10.734 --> 21:13.100
I can do that,
I was a bartender for years.

21:13.100 --> 21:14.767
Do you need me to?
- Okay, yeah, go do that.

21:14.767 --> 21:17.567
- Jax tries to act like that
I'm bad at time management,

21:17.600 --> 21:20.233
but really he is.
And by him being late,

21:20.233 --> 21:22.600
he made me late.
He's bringing me down with him.

21:22.633 --> 21:24.734
- When he shows up,
tell him to  off.

21:24.767 --> 21:27.033
- Okay, I will. I'm sorry.

21:30.133 --> 21:32.600

rest to the party.

21:32.633 --> 21:34.133

21:34.133 --> 21:35.600
I'm so happy that
you're here with me.

21:35.633 --> 21:39.233
- I did Stassi's podcast
- Oh, my God, I forgot!

21:39.266 --> 21:40.667
- Yes.
- Tell me everything.

21:40.667 --> 21:42.266

talking about like

21:44.667 --> 21:46.600
that you're okay
with being ignorant.

21:46.633 --> 21:49.367
- I don't think Stassi
is an ignorant person.

21:49.400 --> 21:53.100
I just think she doesn't think
before she speaks sometimes.

21:53.133 --> 21:54.767

the podcast, and I was like--

right now.
- You don't have to

21:59.667 --> 22:01.200
talk about anything.

22:01.233 --> 22:02.467

than eight years ago

27:50.700 --> 27:53.567
that I had
a pretty serious accident.

27:53.567 --> 27:58.300
- My name is Kate Maloney,
and I'm an actress.

27:58.300 --> 28:02.433
And by actress,
I mean I'm a waitress.

28:02.433 --> 28:07.166
I had...
fallen through a skylight.

28:07.166 --> 28:11.633
Fallen 25 feet
down a flight of stairs.

28:11.667 --> 28:14.400
I'm wired shut.

28:14.433 --> 28:17.433
It's really...

28:17.433 --> 28:19.633
Effective.
I'm missing some teeth.

28:19.667 --> 28:21.500
Yay.

28:21.533 --> 28:26.033
Everything's been put
into perspective.

28:26.066 --> 28:28.467
When you cheat death,

28:28.467 --> 28:32.467
you can't help but
look at things differently.

28:32.467 --> 28:35.400
As part of that,
I have this scar on my face.

28:35.433 --> 28:37.033
And they offered to, you know,

28:37.066 --> 28:38.467
I could go see
a plastic surgeon

28:38.467 --> 28:40.567
and, you know,
remove the scar.

28:40.600 --> 28:42.600
But erasing that
would have erased, like,

28:42.600 --> 28:45.333
this pretty monumental
moment in my life.

28:45.333 --> 28:47.333
- I'll always remember
when you said,

28:47.333 --> 28:51.066
"This is me, this is who I am,"
and I want to see that Katie.

28:51.066 --> 28:53.300
- And so I think, you know,
I like my scar.

28:53.333 --> 28:55.066
I think it gives me character,

28:55.066 --> 28:57.533
and it's also a badge of honor
in some ways.

28:57.567 --> 29:00.734
That I, you know,
went through something crazy

29:00.734 --> 29:03.600
but I'm still here.

29:03.600 --> 29:06.734

is the most beautiful woman.

for saying that.

29:08.333 --> 29:09.700

tell you otherwise.

you have no idea.

37:05.700 --> 37:07.600
- I have all this anger.
- I have all this anger.

37:07.600 --> 37:09.266
- And I hurt people.
- And I hurt people.

37:09.300 --> 37:10.533
- Who's going
to own this anger?

37:10.567 --> 37:12.200
- Who's going
to own this anger?

37:12.233 --> 37:14.433
- I won't let it be me.
- I won't let it be me.

37:23.100 --> 37:24.567
- Come on in.

37:24.600 --> 37:27.033
Look at the boys.

37:27.066 --> 37:28.734
- Yeah.
- Three of a kind.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.734
- Just what we need in
this place, an ironing board.

37:31.767 --> 37:33.500
We're going to need plenty
of room to walk around.

37:33.500 --> 37:35.233
I didn't even ask anybody.

37:35.266 --> 37:38.333
Was it
- Uh, yeah, it was good.

37:38.367 --> 37:40.100
It went fine,
I mean, Kevin Lee,

37:40.133 --> 37:42.033
he started saying
something about,

37:42.066 --> 37:44.066
like, oh, you look,
like, bigger.

37:44.100 --> 37:45.367
I mean like, you gained weight.

37:45.367 --> 37:47.233
- Wait, what are you
talking about?

37:47.266 --> 37:49.600
- He was like, when I saw you,
he was like, I was shocked.

37:49.633 --> 37:51.767
- That's, that's such a bitchy
thing to say to someone.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.333
- You're not overweight.
Come on.

37:53.367 --> 37:55.033
You're not overweight at all.

37:55.066 --> 37:57.433
- I would have been like,
dude,  you, man.

37:57.467 --> 37:59.233
- Exactly, exactly.

37:59.233 --> 38:02.333
Kevin Lee and any
man who thinks it's okay

38:02.367 --> 38:04.100
to comment about
a woman's body.

38:04.100 --> 38:05.600
- I think you're sexy.

38:05.633 --> 38:08.033
- Because as long as
a woman feels good

38:08.066 --> 38:10.266
inside of her own skin
and loves her body,

38:10.266 --> 38:12.200
there's nothing
more beautiful than that.

38:12.233 --> 38:13.233
Okay, I'm not going
to worry about it.

38:13.266 --> 38:15.000
- That's a good attitude.

38:15.033 --> 38:16.767
- Priv's coming over to
hook them up with haircuts.

38:17.000 --> 38:18.367
- All right, have fun you guys,

38:18.400 --> 38:20.400
but try not to make
too much of a mess.

38:20.433 --> 38:22.500
- All right,
we'll take care of it.

38:22.533 --> 38:25.133
- Yes, I do.

38:30.266 --> 38:31.667
Hey guys, I'm Tom.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.133
- Don't tell Katie we didn't
put anything down, okay?

38:37.166 --> 38:38.467
- Brandon, you already look
ten times better.

38:38.500 --> 38:40.200
- This is awesome.

38:40.233 --> 38:42.200
- Hey, look at Burt
right now, he's peacocking.

38:42.233 --> 38:44.100
- I told you,
I'm a good looking man.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.467
- We act like idiots
and we goof around a lot,

38:48.500 --> 38:50.200
but I feel like this trip was,

38:50.233 --> 38:52.667
without a doubt,
a major success.

38:52.700 --> 38:54.166
- Honestly, the last few days

38:54.166 --> 38:55.433
has been the best
time of my life.

38:55.433 --> 38:56.700
- Love you guys.

38:56.700 --> 38:57.700
- That's all I care about
is family.

38:57.734 --> 38:59.100
- I know, I love you.

38:59.133 --> 39:00.233
I'm going to savor this moment.

39:00.266 --> 39:02.033
- Guys, let's get you dressed.

39:02.033 --> 39:03.533
- All right, all right.

39:03.567 --> 39:06.266
- Take this off a little bit.
There, like that.

39:06.300 --> 39:09.266
- All right, guys.
- All right.

39:09.300 --> 39:14.300
- Whoo, whoo, whoo!

39:14.333 --> 39:16.266
- There he is.
- Oh man, peacocking.

39:16.300 --> 39:18.400
Dude, you look good!
- Burticus Maximus Sparticus.

39:18.433 --> 39:20.367
- Let me get a picture
real quick, guys.

39:20.400 --> 39:22.533
I know I'm biased
because I'm their brother,

39:22.567 --> 39:24.166
but I'm telling you,

39:24.200 --> 39:26.633
you won't meet sweeter kids
than my brothers.

39:26.667 --> 39:28.667
You know,
I love them very much.

39:28.700 --> 39:31.567
And seeing the looks on
my brother's faces, it just...

39:31.567 --> 39:33.700
Oh, man.

39:33.734 --> 39:36.066
It gets to me, it makes
me smile, it really does.

39:36.066 --> 39:38.166
- Officially,
welcome to Hollywood.

39:38.200 --> 39:40.066
- Yeah, man.
- Hey, man, dude!

39:40.100 --> 39:42.400
♪ ♪

39:42.433 --> 39:44.266
- I love LA.

39:47.300 --> 39:52.533
♪ ♪

39:52.567 --> 39:55.567
- Hello, nice to see you.
- How are you, nice to see you.

39:55.600 --> 39:57.033
- I'm good.
- Sorry, I'm a little sweaty.

39:57.066 --> 39:59.300
- Have a seat.
- Okay, heal away.

40:00.700 --> 40:02.300
- So first,
let's do a check in.

40:02.333 --> 40:03.734
So the last time I saw you,

40:03.734 --> 40:06.033
you were open,
which was amazing.

40:06.066 --> 40:07.533
- Yeah.
- So now,

40:07.567 --> 40:10.300
what's happened for you,
and what's been coming up?

40:10.333 --> 40:12.166
- I just literally
went apesh--.

40:12.200 --> 40:15.367
- What's here that's making you
so

40:15.367 --> 40:17.467
- I don't know, I don't know,
I wish I knew.

40:17.500 --> 40:19.233
I'm actually going
to not just one therapist,

40:19.266 --> 40:20.633
but two therapists.

40:20.667 --> 40:22.567
- What do you think,
like, for your own self?

40:22.600 --> 40:24.166
Like, that you want to change?

40:24.200 --> 40:25.500
- It's kind of like,
what can I get away with?

40:25.533 --> 40:28.233
- Wow.
- Kelsey, My "reiki therapist,"

40:28.266 --> 40:32.100
sees good in me down deep.
And that means a lot to me.

40:32.133 --> 40:33.767
- Okay.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.166
- So repeat after me.
I have all this anger.

40:36.200 --> 40:37.767
- I have all this anger.
- So I burst out.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.500
- So I burst out.
- And I hurt people.

40:39.500 --> 40:40.734
- And I hurt people.

40:40.767 --> 40:42.200
- Who's going
to own this anger?

40:42.233 --> 40:43.700
- Who's going
to own this anger?

40:43.734 --> 40:46.166
- I won't let it be me.
- I won't let it be me.

40:46.200 --> 40:47.300
- Okay, take a
deep breath with me.

40:51.100 --> 40:52.633
- What was like
the first ----ed up mistake

40:52.667 --> 40:55.100
you made that started
the path of destruction?

40:55.133 --> 40:57.266
- Probably getting into the
business that I got into.

40:57.300 --> 40:58.667
It was a bad idea.
- Okay, and how did you

40:58.667 --> 41:00.200
get into the business?
- The industry.

41:00.233 --> 41:01.400
The acting,
the modeling and stuff.

41:01.433 --> 41:03.266
It's such
a disgusting like, life.

41:03.266 --> 41:05.100
90% of the time,
you're rejected.

41:05.133 --> 41:06.667
So living a life of being told
you're not good enough

41:06.667 --> 41:08.133
or we don't like you,
or this and that.

41:08.133 --> 41:09.400
And then when they do
like you,

41:09.433 --> 41:11.200
when you do get picked
for a great job,

41:11.233 --> 41:13.100
they're just using you.
It's like--You're a prop.

41:13.133 --> 41:14.633
- So let's just
get really clear.

41:14.667 --> 41:18.333
You chose to go down that path.
- Right, I did.

41:18.367 --> 41:20.400
- You chose to use your looks
and whatever it is.

41:20.400 --> 41:22.100
- Because I didn't want to do--
- But that's my point.

41:22.133 --> 41:23.633
I want you to own that.

41:23.667 --> 41:26.133
- I'm a work-in-progress.
- You are, but we all are.

41:26.166 --> 41:29.200
You can learn Jax better.

41:31.433 --> 41:33.000
- You can call me Jason.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.500
- I would love
to call you Jason.

41:34.533 --> 41:36.100
- Jax--I'm over this person.
That's my actual name.

41:36.133 --> 41:40.133
- I really appreciate,
so I want to know Jason.

41:40.166 --> 41:45.000
- I was 19, 20 years old when
I started this "Jax" person.

41:45.033 --> 41:48.100
Living in this fictitious
world of modeling

41:48.133 --> 41:49.767
and being around
pretty people all the time--

41:50.000 --> 41:51.633
it's a lot of pressure.

41:51.667 --> 41:53.367
So I had to feel like
I had to tell stories

41:53.400 --> 41:55.033
for people to like me.

41:55.066 --> 41:56.300
I was a chameleon.

41:56.333 --> 41:58.133
- So, Jason.

41:58.166 --> 42:01.433
- It's crazy to say it.
- I got to get back to Jason.

42:01.433 --> 42:05.033
I'd like to get
to know that guy again.

42:05.033 --> 42:06.300
Yeah.

42:11.133 --> 42:12.233
- Does that feel
authentic and true for you?

42:12.266 --> 42:14.233
- Yes, yeah.
- Good.

42:14.266 --> 42:16.367
- All right, Jason.
I'll see you soon, honey.

42:16.400 --> 42:18.533
- Okay. Thank you so much.
- You are so welcome.

42:19.700 --> 42:22.133
- Next time on
"Vanderpump Rules"...

42:22.166 --> 42:24.600
- I'm having a birthday party,
and it's murder.

42:24.600 --> 42:26.567
Excellent.

42:26.600 --> 42:28.300
- Stassi and I
share a birthday.

42:28.333 --> 42:29.667
I'm just going to be me.

42:31.166 --> 42:33.734
- May I introduce
Queen Ariana.

42:35.734 --> 42:39.133
- I wanted
to talk to you about Jax.

42:39.166 --> 42:40.467
I don't want him
there tomorrow.

42:40.500 --> 42:43.266
Do not come anywhere near me.

42:43.300 --> 42:46.433
- I'm turning 32 tomorrow.
- 30s is your prime.

42:46.467 --> 42:48.734
Like, sexually.
- Oh, I don't have sex.

42:48.734 --> 42:51.567
- You were freakin'
having multiple orgasms.

42:51.600 --> 42:53.066
- Okay.

42:53.100 --> 42:55.233
- You get Stassi
and bring her over here.

42:56.567 --> 42:59.467
It's my birthday.
Tell Patrick that I'm leaving.

42:59.500 --> 43:02.633
- Are you ----ing
kidding me, Stassi?

43:02.633 --> 43:04.200
