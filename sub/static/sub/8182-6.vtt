00:06.255 --> 00:08.022

00:08.090 --> 00:09.991
MM. SOUNDS LIKE
SOMEONE WISHES

00:10.058 --> 00:13.294
THEY WERE HALF-NAKED
AND SMELLED LIKE VANILLA.

00:14.580 --> 00:15.363
OH, GREAT. THEY'RE DOING
THE HUBCAPS.

00:15.431 --> 00:17.482

01:55.831 --> 01:57.966
YO. IS THE TRI-TIP

01:58.033 --> 01:59.033
HEY, MAN. WHOA, WHOA!

01:59.101 --> 01:59.951
YOU DON'T OPEN A SMOKER

02:00.102 --> 02:01.035
WHILE IT'S STILL SMOKING.

02:01.103 --> 02:03.270
WHAT ARE YOU,
SOME KINDA ANIMAL?

02:03.338 --> 02:04.156
YOU PUT IT IN, LIKE,
WEDNESDAY.

02:04.223 --> 02:05.390
YOU SURE
IT'S EVEN WORKING?

02:05.458 --> 02:06.441
UH, I THINK I KNOW

02:06.509 --> 02:08.276
IF MY SMOKER'S WORKING
OR NOT, OK?

02:08.342 --> 02:10.244
YEAH, GUY,
IT'S ACTUALLY COLD.

02:11.814 --> 02:13.131
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I HOPE YOU LIKE COLE SLAW,

02:13.199 --> 02:14.565
'CAUSE THAT'S ALL YOU'RE
GETTING. GET OUTTA HERE.

02:20.856 --> 02:21.739
SHE'S STILL A LITTLE RAW,

02:21.807 --> 02:23.541
BUT IT'S COMING ALONG.
IT'S COMING ALONG.

02:23.609 --> 02:25.377
WHAT ARE YOU DRAWING
THERE, SWEETIE?

02:25.444 --> 02:28.180
UNCLE DOUG EATING A CARROT.

02:28.247 --> 02:30.382
A CARROT. HMM.

02:30.449 --> 02:32.217
YOU HAVE SUCH A GOOD
IMAGINATION.

02:34.987 --> 02:36.704
COME ON, MAN. YOU'RE
HITTING THOSE APPLETINIS

02:36.772 --> 02:38.205
A LITTLE HARD.

02:38.273 --> 02:39.874
THIS IS A VIRGIN APPLETINI.

02:39.941 --> 02:43.578
THIS IS BASICALLY
A JUICE BOX IN A GLASS.

02:46.398 --> 02:47.498
WHAT'S WITH THE HOBBIT?

02:50.102 --> 02:53.555
AH, HE LOST HIS JOB
A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO.

02:53.622 --> 02:55.156
AW, DON'T FEEL
TOO BAD, SON.

02:55.224 --> 02:57.092
YOU KNOW HOW MANY
JOBS I LOST IN MY LIFE?

02:57.159 --> 02:59.160
76.

02:59.228 --> 03:02.581
BUT WORKING IN THE SUBWAY
IS ALL I'VE EVER KNOWN.

03:02.648 --> 03:04.382
NOW I FEEL LIKE...
I DON'T KNOW,

03:04.450 --> 03:07.218
I- I HAVE NO PURPOSE
IN LIFE.

03:08.504 --> 03:09.937
HARD TO ARGUE WITH THAT.

03:12.741 --> 03:14.375
IS THE FOOD ALMOST READY?
EVERYBODY'S STARVING.

03:14.443 --> 03:16.511
YEAH. IT'S COMING,
OK?

03:16.578 --> 03:18.980
YOU KNOW, WE HAVE A PERFECTLY
GOOD BARBECUE RIGHT THERE.

03:19.048 --> 03:22.100
OK, YOU WANNA
CHECK THE ATTITUDE?

03:22.168 --> 03:23.168
'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU KNOW THIS,

03:23.235 --> 03:24.302
BUT SMOKED MEAT
IS A PRIVILEGE.

03:24.370 --> 03:25.370
IT'S NOT A RIGHT,
OK?

03:25.438 --> 03:26.938
YOU WANNA LOSE
THAT PRIVILEGE? HUH?

03:27.005 --> 03:28.789
HEY, ANYBODY ELSE HERE GOT
A PROBLEM WITH MY SMOKER?

03:28.857 --> 03:29.858
SERIOUSLY... OK?

03:29.925 --> 03:31.092
'CAUSE I DON'T WANNA
HEAR IT.

03:31.160 --> 03:33.928
GOOD TO SEE
EVERYBODY, THOUGH.

03:33.996 --> 03:35.062
HEY, HONEY.

03:35.130 --> 03:36.831
HEY, BABY.

03:36.899 --> 03:38.199
UH, WHERE'S KIRBY?

03:38.266 --> 03:40.301
WHAT? YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO
PICK HIM UP AT THE REC CENTER.

03:40.369 --> 03:42.136
NO, DIDN'T YOU GET MY MESSAGE?
I SAID YOU HAD TO GET HIM

03:42.204 --> 03:43.137
'CAUSE I WAS BRINGING
THE ICE CREAM,

03:43.205 --> 03:44.271
I DIDN'T WANT IT
TO MELT.

03:44.339 --> 03:45.973
I DIDN'T CHECK
MY VOICEMAIL.

03:46.041 --> 03:47.008
THEN WHY DO YOU HAVE IT IF
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO CHECK IT?

03:47.076 --> 03:48.576
YOU KNOW, KELLY, EVER
SINCE YOU STARTED WORKING-

03:48.643 --> 03:50.277
OH, DON'T YOU EVEN
START WITH ME-

03:50.345 --> 03:51.730
GUYS, GUYS, GUYS...

03:51.797 --> 03:53.598
I'LL GO PICK UP KIRBY,
OK?

03:53.666 --> 03:55.016
OH, SPENCE, YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

03:55.084 --> 03:57.902
NO, SERIOUSLY.
I'D BE HAPPY TO.

03:57.970 --> 04:01.138
GIVE ME A REASON NOT TO
PUT A BULLET IN MY HEAD.

04:02.024 --> 04:03.625
THANKS, MAN. COME ON.

04:09.364 --> 04:11.632
I MADE THIS FOR YOU,
ARTHUR.

04:11.700 --> 04:14.686
OH, WHAT A THOUGHTFUL
YOUNG MAN.

04:14.754 --> 04:15.687
WHAT IS THIS SUPPOSED TO BE?

04:15.755 --> 04:17.288
SOME KIND OF MONSTER?

04:17.356 --> 04:18.572
NO, IT'S YOU.

04:21.661 --> 04:24.129
DON'T QUIT YOUR DAY JOB,
PICASSO!

04:29.401 --> 04:33.054
AW, THERE'S MY
HANDSOME SON-IN-LAW.

04:33.122 --> 04:34.856
I'M NOT LENDING YOU
ANY MONEY, ARTHUR.

04:34.924 --> 04:37.408
FOR YOUR INFORMATION,
I'M NOT ASKING FOR A LOAN.

04:37.476 --> 04:41.095
THIS WOULD BE
AN OUTRIGHT GIFT.

04:41.163 --> 04:43.264
WHA-WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

04:43.331 --> 04:45.116
I WANT BRACES.

04:48.320 --> 04:51.489
YOU MEAN... FOR YOUR LEGS?

04:51.557 --> 04:53.057
NO, MY TEETH.

04:53.125 --> 04:56.110
MAJOR'S PICTURE OF ME
WAS A WAKE-UP CALL.

04:56.178 --> 04:58.730
ARTHUR, THIS LOOKS
NOTHING LIKE YOU.

04:58.797 --> 05:00.832
EXCEPT FOR MAYBE
THE MONKEY HANDS.

05:00.900 --> 05:02.099
OH, PLEASE.
ALL MY LIFE

05:02.167 --> 05:03.601
I'VE BEEN ASHAMED
OF MY TEETH.

05:03.669 --> 05:04.852
IT'S WHAT'S
HELD ME BACK.

05:04.920 --> 05:05.953
YEAH, IT WAS THE TEETH,

05:06.021 --> 05:07.572
NOT THE VIOLENT OUTBURSTS.
YEAH.

05:08.941 --> 05:11.042
MY ORTHODONTIST SAID I WOULD
ONLY HAVE TO WEAR THE BRACES

05:11.109 --> 05:13.244
2 TO 3 YEARS, AND THEN
I'LL BE A NEW MAN.

05:13.311 --> 05:15.180
I'D FINALLY BE ABLE
TO APPROACH A WOMAN

05:15.247 --> 05:18.883
WITHOUT COQUETTISHLY
WAVING A FAN OVER MY MOUTH.

05:18.951 --> 05:21.219
ARTHUR, YOUR TEETH
ARE FINE.

05:21.286 --> 05:23.871
DOUGLAS, YOUR DEEP
AFFECTION FOR ME

05:23.939 --> 05:26.040
HAS BLINDED YOU TO THE TRUTH.

05:27.242 --> 05:30.979
LOOK AT THESE
"BEFORE" PICTURES.

05:31.046 --> 05:33.414
THIS IS AN EXTREME CLOSE-UP
OF MY UPPER MOUTH.

05:33.482 --> 05:35.767
OH, GOD, PUT THAT
AWAY!

05:35.834 --> 05:37.468
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?

05:37.536 --> 05:39.370
FOR ONLY $3,200,

05:39.438 --> 05:42.507
I'LL BE ABLE TO GET
A MILLION DOLLAR SMILE.

05:42.574 --> 05:44.826
$3,200, THAT'S ALL?

05:44.893 --> 05:47.061
YOU KNOW WHAT, UH, LET ME
JUST PERUSE THE BROCHURE,

05:47.128 --> 05:48.596
YOU KNOW, I'LL CRUNCH
SOME NUMBERS TOGETHER,

05:48.664 --> 05:51.332
AND I'LL, UH
- I'LL GET BACK TO YOU ASAP, ALL RIGHT?

05:51.399 --> 05:52.850
THANK YOU, DOUGLAS.

05:52.918 --> 05:54.753
SLAP IT HIGH!
YO!

06:03.145 --> 06:04.078
HEY, BABY.

06:04.146 --> 06:06.347
HI, HONEY.

06:06.414 --> 06:08.466
WOW. WHAT SMELLS
SO GOOD?

06:08.533 --> 06:10.802
DO NOT TOUCH
THIS DISH,

06:10.869 --> 06:12.670
IT IS EXTREMELY HOT.

06:12.738 --> 06:14.589
OH, HEY, DEAC.
WHAT ARE YOU DRINKING?

06:14.657 --> 06:17.024
UM... A BEER?

06:17.092 --> 06:18.843
COMING RIGHT UP.

06:20.595 --> 06:23.698
WHY-WHY IS MY FRIEND
HERE WEARING AN APRON?

06:23.765 --> 06:25.233
WE AGREED WE NEEDED
SOME HELP,

06:25.301 --> 06:27.101
SO I HIRED SPENCE.

06:28.854 --> 06:31.689
SO, SPENCE IS NOW
OUR-OUR MAID?

06:31.757 --> 06:34.242
NO, NO. HE'S MORE
OF A HOUSEBOY.

06:35.761 --> 06:36.527
HE'S A GOOD COOK,

06:36.679 --> 06:37.745
HE'S GREAT
WITH THE KIDS,

06:37.813 --> 06:39.480
AND HE WAS SO
DESPERATE, I GOT HIM

06:39.548 --> 06:41.849
FOR PRACTICALLY
NOTHING.

06:41.917 --> 06:43.701
HERE YOU GO, BIG GUY.

06:43.769 --> 06:45.136
UH, THANKS, MAN.

06:45.203 --> 06:47.988
FROSTED GLASS.

06:48.056 --> 06:49.056
NICE TOUCH.

06:49.124 --> 06:51.275
I KNOW THAT'S
HOW YOU LIKED IT.

06:53.412 --> 06:54.612
I...

06:54.679 --> 06:55.997
GOT MYSELF
A HOUSEBOY.

06:56.065 --> 06:57.065
HA HA HA!

06:57.132 --> 06:58.799
AHH...

06:58.867 --> 07:02.002
IF ONLY MY GRANDPA
WERE ALIVE TO SEE THIS.

07:04.073 --> 07:05.606
SIT... SIT.

07:05.674 --> 07:07.275
SIT. SIT-SIT. SIT.

07:07.342 --> 07:08.976
SIT. SIT.

07:09.044 --> 07:09.977
OK, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING?

07:10.045 --> 07:13.631
JUST TRAINING
MY VIRTUAL DOG.

07:13.699 --> 07:17.167
SIT. SIT-HEY,
DON'T YOU GROWL AT ME.

07:17.235 --> 07:19.286
HONEY, I GOTTA TALK TO
YOU FOR A SECOND, OK?

07:19.354 --> 07:21.388
ONE SECOND, LET ME JUST HIT HIM
WITH A VIRTUAL NEWSPAPER HERE.

07:21.456 --> 07:23.458
COME ON! BAD-
OOH, KILLED HIM.

07:23.525 --> 07:25.859
OK, WHAT'S UP?

07:25.928 --> 07:28.695
UH, YOU KNOW MY DAD TALKED
TO ME ABOUT THE BRACES.

07:28.764 --> 07:30.815
BRACES. I GOTTA SAY, ONE
THING ABOUT YOUR FATHER

07:30.883 --> 07:32.517
IS HE'S NEVER BORING.

07:32.584 --> 07:35.319
ACTUALLY, HE'S ALWAYS BORING,
BUT THAT WAS FUNNY!

07:35.387 --> 07:38.172
ACTUALLY, I-I
KINDA TOLD HIM

07:38.240 --> 07:39.506
THAT HE CAN GET 'EM.

07:40.626 --> 07:43.410
WHAT? CAR-ARE YOU CRAZY?

07:43.478 --> 07:44.529
WHAT, DOUG? WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO SAY?

07:44.596 --> 07:45.996
HE REALLY WANTED
THEM.

07:46.064 --> 07:47.598
HE WANTS A LOT OF THINGS!

07:47.666 --> 07:51.202
HE WANTS A HELICOPTER, HE WANTS
ME TO BANKROLL HIS MUFFIN SHOP.

07:51.270 --> 07:53.338
COME ON, NOW.
YOU CAN SAY NO YOU KNOW.

07:53.405 --> 07:55.239
THAT'S HOW YOU KEEP
FROM SPOILING HIM.

07:55.307 --> 07:56.173
JEEZ.
LOOK, DOUG,

07:56.241 --> 07:57.709
I KNOW IT'S
EXPENSIVE,

07:57.776 --> 07:59.377
OK, BUT I THINK
IT'LL REALLY HELP

07:59.444 --> 08:01.479
HIS SELF-ESTEEM
DOWN THE ROAD.

08:01.547 --> 08:03.981
DOWN THE ROAD?

08:06.585 --> 08:07.785
CAR, I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU KNOW THIS,

08:07.853 --> 08:11.121
BUT HIS EXIT'S COMING UP PRETTY QUICK.

08:11.189 --> 08:14.725
OK, IF I WAS HIM, I'D GET
INTO THE RIGHT LANE ABOUT NOW.

08:14.793 --> 08:16.443
OK, YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT IS RIDICULOUS,

08:16.511 --> 08:18.713
BUT HE'S MY FATHER.
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO TELL HIM

08:18.780 --> 08:20.047
IT'S TOO LATE
TO GET BRACES?

08:20.115 --> 08:21.749
EASY, YOU JUST SAY, "LOOK,
WE'RE NOT GETTING YOU BRACES

08:21.817 --> 08:22.934
"FOR THE SAME REASON
WE DON'T GET YOU

08:23.002 --> 08:24.869
"THE BIG BOTTLE OF SHAMPOO AT COSTCO.

08:24.937 --> 08:26.503
BECAUSE TIME'S NOT
EXACTLY ON YOUR SIDE."

08:29.074 --> 08:31.342
THERE'S THE GUY.

08:31.410 --> 08:33.344
DAD, HE DIDN'T MEAN-

08:33.412 --> 08:34.995
NO, NO. HE'S ABSOLUTELY
RIGHT.

08:35.063 --> 08:37.548
FOR A SECOND THERE I
THOUGHT I HAD A FUTURE.

08:37.616 --> 08:39.683
THANK YOU, DOUGLAS,
FOR SETTING STRAIGHT

08:39.751 --> 08:41.818
A FOOLISH OLD MAN.

08:41.886 --> 08:44.105
NO PROBLEM.

08:49.661 --> 08:52.513
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK, HUH?

09:23.945 --> 09:26.046
HELLO? YEAH-

09:26.114 --> 09:28.116
DANNY, I TOLD YOU
NOT TO CALL ME HERE

09:28.183 --> 09:29.117
WHEN I'M WORKING.

09:29.184 --> 09:30.718
YEAH, WELL-

09:30.785 --> 09:32.520
I'M NOT JUMPING
DOWN YOUR THROAT,

09:32.587 --> 09:34.055
I'M JUST ASKING FOR A
LITTLE CONSIDERATION.

09:34.123 --> 09:35.656
ALL RIGHT-NO.
YOU KNOW? WE-

09:35.724 --> 09:37.725
WE WILL TALK
- WE WILL TALK ABOUT THIS LATER.

09:37.792 --> 09:39.293
ALL RIGHT? GOOD-BYE!

09:39.361 --> 09:41.011
WAS THAT YOUR WIFE?

09:41.079 --> 09:43.531
NO, JUST...

09:43.598 --> 09:47.402
THE MOST EXASPERATING
MAN IN THE WORLD.

09:47.469 --> 09:49.687
OH.

09:49.754 --> 09:51.355
DON'T YOU GUYS WORRY,
OK?

09:51.422 --> 09:54.992
I'M-I'M GONNA BE HERE
FOR A LONG TIME.

10:57.556 --> 10:58.772
CAN I INTEREST YOU
IN SOME OF MY...

10:58.840 --> 11:01.559
<i>HUEVOS RANCHEROS?</i>

11:04.462 --> 11:06.463
I'M GOOD.

11:06.531 --> 11:09.650
STOP STARING AT HIS MOUTH.

11:09.718 --> 11:11.669
I CAN'T, CARRIE. IT
LOOKS LIKE HE ATE A BIRD.

11:14.339 --> 11:16.456
BY THE BY, DOUGLAS,

11:16.524 --> 11:18.159
COULD YOU FLOAT ME
$50?

11:18.226 --> 11:21.561
I'LL GIVE YOU 20
TO FACE THE OTHER DIRECTION.

11:21.629 --> 11:23.380
WHAT DO YOU NEED
THE MONEY FOR, DAD?

11:23.448 --> 11:24.832
FOR THIS
APPLICATION.

11:24.899 --> 11:27.368
IN THE SPIRIT OF THE
NEW AND IMPROVED ME,

11:27.436 --> 11:29.236
I'VE DECIDED TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL.

11:29.304 --> 11:31.505
REALLY?

11:31.573 --> 11:33.674
THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS?

11:33.742 --> 11:35.676
OK, THAT'S NICE,
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE

11:35.744 --> 11:39.179
YOU COULD TAKE CLASSES AT QUEENSBOROUGH
COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOR FREE.

11:39.247 --> 11:41.215
WAS QUEENSBOROUGH NAMED

11:41.283 --> 11:43.450
THE NUMBER ONE PARTY SCHOOL IN AMERICA?

11:43.518 --> 11:45.519
I DON'T THINK SO.

11:45.586 --> 11:47.788
ARTHUR, YOU JUST
GOT BRACES.

11:47.856 --> 11:50.324
I'M NOT PAYING FOR YOU
TO GO AWAY TO COLLEGE, OK?

11:50.392 --> 11:51.642
REALLY?

11:51.710 --> 11:54.144
IS IT BECAUSE I'M TOO OLD TO FINISH

11:54.212 --> 11:57.080
A BOTTLE
OF SHAMPOO?

11:57.148 --> 12:00.767
WHY DON'T YOU TRY STARTING
A BOTTLE OF SHAMPOO?

12:00.835 --> 12:02.536
CORN MEAL
WORKS BETTER

12:02.604 --> 12:03.704
AT HALF THE PRICE!
ALL RIGHT.

12:03.772 --> 12:05.022
ALL RIGHT.

12:05.090 --> 12:06.390
DAD, LET ME
LOOK THIS OVER, OK?

12:06.458 --> 12:07.892
I'LL GET BACK TO YOU.

12:07.960 --> 12:09.710
GREAT. FYI,
SAN DIEGO STATE

12:09.777 --> 12:10.611
IS MY SAFETY SCHOOL.

12:17.486 --> 12:19.953
HA HA HA!

12:20.022 --> 12:21.222
HEY, CHECK THIS OUT,
MAN.

12:21.289 --> 12:23.224
SPENCE MADE ME A PANINI
SANDWICH, AND LOOK.

12:23.291 --> 12:26.827
HE TOASTED MY INITIALS INTO THE BREAD.

12:26.895 --> 12:28.762
THAT'S GREAT. I'M GLAD THINGS
ARE WORKING OUT WELL FOR YOU.

12:28.830 --> 12:30.248
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

12:30.315 --> 12:31.232
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

12:31.299 --> 12:33.100
THAT I'M OUT ALMOST 4 GRAND
AND THIS WEEKEND

12:33.168 --> 12:34.568
I'VE GOT TO TAKE
AN 80-YEAR-OLD MAN

12:34.636 --> 12:36.303
ON A TOUR OF RUTGERS.

12:36.371 --> 12:37.571
YOU KNOW WHAT,

12:37.638 --> 12:39.974
MY HOUSEBOY SURE KNOWS
HIS WAY AROUND A SANDWICH.

12:40.041 --> 12:42.376
YOU KNOW, THIS IS ALL
YOUR KID'S FAULT

12:42.444 --> 12:44.378
FOR DRAWING THAT STUPID
PICTURE OF ARTHUR.

12:44.446 --> 12:47.715
WHY CAN'T HE JUST EAT HIS
CRAYONS LIKE I USED TO?

12:47.783 --> 12:50.951
WELL, SORRY IT DIDN'T WORK
OUT FOR YOU LIKE IT DID FOR ME.

12:51.018 --> 12:52.653
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT?

12:52.721 --> 12:54.672
WELL, A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO
HE MADE A PICTURE OF KELLY.

12:54.739 --> 12:57.975
TO DRAW HER BUTT,
HE TRACED A PAINT CAN.

12:58.043 --> 12:59.277
SHE TOOK ONE LOOK AT THAT

12:59.344 --> 13:01.845
AND STARTED HITTIN'
THE TREADMILL IN A BIG WAY.

13:01.913 --> 13:03.397
REALLY?

13:03.465 --> 13:06.184
GOD IS GOOD, BRO.

13:06.251 --> 13:09.053
YOU THINK MAJOR WOULD
DRAW A PICTURE OF CARRIE?

13:09.121 --> 13:10.837
WHAT FOR? SHE DOESN'T
NEED TO LOSE WEIGHT.

13:10.905 --> 13:13.490
OH, I KNOW, BUT THERE
ARE OTHER IMPROVEMENTS

13:13.558 --> 13:16.093
THAT, YOU KNOW...
HMM?

13:19.881 --> 13:21.899
EVEN SMALLER.
YOU GOTTA MAKE THEM SMALLER.

13:21.967 --> 13:23.067
BUT THAT'S
HOW SHE LOOKS.

13:23.135 --> 13:24.184
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT,
GIVE ME THIS. HERE.

13:24.252 --> 13:25.970
OK? THERE YOU GO.

13:26.038 --> 13:28.205
NOW, SIGN THE BOTTOM.
SIGN IT. JUST SIGN IT.

13:28.272 --> 13:30.290
I'M TRYING TO HAVE A ROMANTIC
DINNER FOR DEACON AND KELLY.

13:30.358 --> 13:32.426
HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN
IN BED A HALF HOUR AGO.

13:32.494 --> 13:34.144
COOL YOUR JETS,
HAZEL.

13:34.212 --> 13:36.463
OK.

13:36.531 --> 13:38.332
HA HA!

13:38.399 --> 13:40.501
WHY DOES CARRIE HAVE
THE BODY OF A BOY?

13:40.569 --> 13:41.151
I COULD ASK YOU
THE SAME THING.

13:43.287 --> 13:45.272
THAT SMELLS GOOD. COULD YOU
GET ME A LITTLE OF THAT TO GO?

13:45.340 --> 13:49.260
UH, NOT UNTIL YOU
START PAYING ME 5.50 AN HOUR.

13:51.997 --> 13:55.182
SO, UH, HOW WAS
THE BRUSCHETTA?

13:55.250 --> 13:57.318
OH, IT'S GREAT.
YUMMY.

13:57.385 --> 13:58.902
NOT TOO OILY?

13:58.970 --> 14:01.489
WELL,
MAYBE A LITTLE.

14:01.556 --> 14:03.324
STUPID!

14:04.392 --> 14:07.928
THAT'S THE SHRIMP
FRA DIABLO.

14:07.996 --> 14:09.763
I WILL NOT MAKE
THE SAME MISTAKE AGAIN.

14:11.132 --> 14:13.233
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO
MAKE HIM FEEL BAD.

14:13.301 --> 14:14.919
DID YOU NOT HEAR ME RAVE
ABOUT THE STUFFED MUSHROOMS?

14:14.986 --> 14:16.453
COME ON.

14:19.174 --> 14:21.241
HEY, DANNY, WE'RE KINDA
IN THE MIDDLE OF DINNER.

14:21.309 --> 14:22.843
YEAH, THIS WON'T
TAKE LONG.

14:24.979 --> 14:27.080
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

14:27.148 --> 14:28.249
YOU BLOCK MY CALLS,

14:28.316 --> 14:29.850
MY TEXT MESSAGES BOUNCE
BACK TO ME.

14:29.917 --> 14:30.917
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO?

14:30.985 --> 14:32.552
WELL, YOU DON'T COME
TO WHERE I WORK.

14:32.620 --> 14:34.321
THE PALMERS ARE TRYING
TO HAVE THEIR DINNER.

14:34.389 --> 14:36.540
WELL, YOU KNOW HOW I GET
WHEN MY ASTHMA ACTS UP.

14:36.608 --> 14:37.858
OH, I GUESS
THAT'S MY FAULT.

14:37.926 --> 14:39.460
IT IS WHEN YOU BORROW
MY VACUUM CLEANER

14:39.527 --> 14:41.462
WITH THE HEPA FILTER.

14:41.529 --> 14:42.762
UH, SPENCE IF YOU'D LIKE

14:42.830 --> 14:44.764
TO TAKE YOUR 15 MINUTE
DINNER BREAK RIGHT NOW-

14:44.816 --> 14:46.283
NO, NO. I WILL TAKE
MY DINNER BREAK

14:46.350 --> 14:49.019
WHEN THE DISHES ARE DONE
AND I'VE RUN YOUR BATH.

14:49.054 --> 14:50.821
WHAT ABOUT MY BATH, HUH?

14:50.888 --> 14:53.190
OH. OH, I SEE
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

14:53.258 --> 14:54.724
THIS ISN'T ABOUT ME WORKING.

14:54.792 --> 14:56.726
THIS IS ABOUT ME NOT WAITING
ON YOU HAND AND FOOT.

14:56.794 --> 14:59.079
NO, IT'S ABOUT YOU NOT
DOING YOUR PART AT HOME.

14:59.147 --> 15:01.615
YOU HAVEN'T COOKED ME A
HOT MEAL IN OVER 2 WEEKS!

15:01.683 --> 15:02.916
OH, I-I-

15:02.984 --> 15:03.984
OK, FINE.

15:04.052 --> 15:05.085
YOU KNOW WHAT? HERE.

15:05.153 --> 15:08.622
HERE'S SOME SHRIMP,
SOME GARLIC BREAD,

15:08.690 --> 15:11.592
AGED PEPPERINO.

15:11.660 --> 15:12.893
SIT. SIT DOWN.

15:12.960 --> 15:14.077
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT,
WE'RE GONNA GO TO BED.

15:14.196 --> 15:15.128
WE GOT TO GET UP
EARLY, SO-

15:15.197 --> 15:16.397
REALLY TIRED.
FINE.

15:16.464 --> 15:18.031
OH. ALL RIGHT.

15:19.534 --> 15:22.802
WORK MY FINGERS
TO THE BONE.

15:28.026 --> 15:29.593
HMM.

15:29.661 --> 15:30.961
WHAT?

15:31.029 --> 15:32.513
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO SAY?

15:32.580 --> 15:34.915
DELICIOUS.

15:36.717 --> 15:38.218
IT'S NOT TOO OILY?

15:38.286 --> 15:39.903
A LITTLE.

15:39.971 --> 15:43.340
BUT YOU KNOW THAT'S
HOW I LIKE IT.

15:56.738 --> 15:58.171
HEY, BABE.
HEY.

15:58.239 --> 15:59.172
HOW'S IT GOING?

16:00.509 --> 16:02.609
YOU KNOW WHAT SOME GUY SAID
ON THE PHONE TO ME TODAY?

16:02.677 --> 16:05.045
"WHAT COUNTRY
ARE YOU FROM?"

16:05.112 --> 16:08.381
DO I NOT SOUND
AMERICAN?

16:08.450 --> 16:10.584
THAT'S CRAZY.
THAT'S CRAZY.

16:13.822 --> 16:16.156
COULD YOU GET ME SOMETHING
OUT OF THE FRIDGE?

16:16.224 --> 16:18.025
WHAT DO YOU NEED,
HONEY?

16:18.093 --> 16:21.394
A... RELISH.

16:21.462 --> 16:22.579
WHAT FOR?

16:22.647 --> 16:24.465
I JUST FORGOT
WHAT IT SMELLS LIKE.

16:24.532 --> 16:26.800
I CAN'T REMEMBER.

16:26.867 --> 16:29.170
NOT FOR THE LIFE
OF ME, YOU KNOW.

16:32.774 --> 16:34.141
WHAT'S THAT?

16:34.208 --> 16:35.693
OH, YEAH.

16:35.760 --> 16:38.729
MAJOR FELT BAD THAT, UH, HE
DIDN'T DRAW YOU AT THE BARBECUE,

16:38.796 --> 16:42.899
SO... THERE YOU ARE.

16:44.402 --> 16:46.770
WELL, ENJOY YOUR TRIP
DOWN MEMORY LANE.

16:46.838 --> 16:48.271
THANK YOU.

16:49.707 --> 16:51.959
SO I SAY TO THE GUY,
"IF I DON'T SOUND AMERICAN"-

16:52.026 --> 16:54.662
MAN, HE'S GOT SOME
SKILLS, TOO, DOESN'T HE?

16:54.729 --> 16:56.813
LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE YOU.

16:58.766 --> 17:02.036
EXACTLY LIKE ME?
I LOOK LIKE A LITTLE BOY.

17:03.104 --> 17:04.104
OH, MY GOD.
I JUST...

17:04.172 --> 17:05.204
TOTALLY PUT MY FOOT
IN MY MOUTH.

17:05.272 --> 17:07.290
I'M SORRY.

17:07.358 --> 17:08.759
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

17:08.827 --> 17:10.577
'CAUSE I JUST SAID IT
LOOKED EXACTLY LIKE YOU,

17:10.645 --> 17:12.613
AND YOU SAID IT LOOKS
LIKE A LITTLE BOY.

17:12.681 --> 17:15.080
WHICH MEANS YOU LOOK
LIKE A LITTLE BOY.

17:15.148 --> 17:17.784
WHATEVER. I'M GONNA GO
TAKE A SHOWER.

17:25.042 --> 17:27.962
CARRIE, I'M SO SORRY
ABOUT ALL THIS.

17:28.029 --> 17:29.062
ABOUT WHAT?

17:29.130 --> 17:31.098
THE PICTURE
THAT MAJOR DREW OF YOU.

17:31.165 --> 17:32.800
I SEE HOW UPSET YOU ARE.

17:32.868 --> 17:35.669
YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE HE JUST DOESN'T
CARE WHO HE HURTS, THIS LITTLE GUY.

17:35.737 --> 17:37.388
I'M FINE WITH IT.

17:37.456 --> 17:38.756
HMM. NO, YOU'RE NOT.

17:38.824 --> 17:40.624
BUT I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT YOU ARE.

17:40.692 --> 17:42.960
YOU'RE BRAVE.

17:48.433 --> 17:49.549
HMM.

17:49.617 --> 17:51.051
WHAT-WHAT'S THAT?

17:51.118 --> 17:53.721
I MEAN, ALL OF A SUDDEN
I'M, LIKE, SELF-CONSCIOUS.

17:53.788 --> 17:54.955
STUPID, RIGHT?

17:55.023 --> 17:56.256
NO, NOT AT ALL.

17:56.324 --> 17:59.192
I MEAN, YOUR DAD SAW SOMETHING
WRONG WITH HIS PICTURE

17:59.260 --> 18:00.193
AND HE DID SOMETHING
ABOUT IT.

18:00.261 --> 18:02.730
HATS OFF TO HIM.

18:02.797 --> 18:05.199
THERE IS SOMETHING THAT...

18:05.266 --> 18:06.400
FORGET IT.
FORGET IT.

18:06.467 --> 18:07.134
OH, OK, YEAH.

18:07.202 --> 18:08.218
I'LL JUST FORGET
ABOUT IT

18:08.286 --> 18:09.420
AND JUST LET MY GIRL
SUFFER IN SILENCE.

18:09.487 --> 18:11.689
COME HERE, BABY.
TALK TO ME.

18:11.756 --> 18:13.223
OK, WELL...

18:13.291 --> 18:14.525
THERE IS SOMETHING
THAT I'VE ALWAYS WANTED

18:14.592 --> 18:16.893
TO CHANGE ABOUT MY BODY.

18:16.961 --> 18:19.530
OH, MY GOD, DO YOU THINK I
SHOULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT?

18:19.597 --> 18:22.182
LOOK, YOU KNOW
I LOVE YOU

18:22.250 --> 18:24.985
AND THINK YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL
JUST THE WAY YOU ARE,

18:25.053 --> 18:27.320
BUT IF YOU FEEL YOU WANT
SOMETHING CHANGED

18:27.388 --> 18:32.092
OR... AUGMENTED,

18:32.160 --> 18:35.228
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
I'M THERE FOR YOU.

18:35.296 --> 18:38.498
YOU KNOW WHAT,
I'M GONNA DO IT.

18:38.566 --> 18:42.535
I'M GONNA GET
CALF IMPLANTS!

18:43.821 --> 18:45.922
NOW, IS CALF
A BRAND NAME OR...

18:45.991 --> 18:48.225
NO, NO. I MEAN,
I LOOKED INTO IT ONCE

18:48.293 --> 18:49.326
AND THEY'RE PRETTY PRICEY,

18:49.394 --> 18:50.594
BUT I COULD FINALLY
HAVE THE SHAPE

18:50.661 --> 18:51.761
THAT I'VE ALWAYS WANTED.

18:51.829 --> 18:53.497
YOU KNOW, MY LEGS
WILL REALLY POP ON THE SUBWAY.

18:53.564 --> 18:56.166
HONEY, THANK YOU!

18:56.234 --> 18:57.417
OH!
YEAH!

18:57.485 --> 18:58.852
YEAH!
OK.

18:58.920 --> 19:00.721
OOH, I'M GONNA GOOGLE
A DOCTOR RIGHT NOW.

19:00.789 --> 19:02.272
OH, YOU GOTTA DO IT
RIGHT AWAY.

19:02.340 --> 19:03.173
GET ON IT.

19:03.241 --> 19:04.557
OK!

19:12.567 --> 19:14.334
ARTHUR, WHAT ARE
YOU EATING?

19:14.402 --> 19:17.704
SALT WATER TAFFY.

19:17.722 --> 19:19.857
BUT THE DENTIST SAID YOU'RE NOT
SUPPOSED TO EAT ANYTHING STICKY.

19:19.925 --> 19:21.107
I DON'T CARE.

19:21.175 --> 19:22.392
BUT IT'LL WRECK
YOUR BRACES.

19:22.460 --> 19:25.829
GOOD. I HATE THEM!

19:25.897 --> 19:27.247
WHAT?

19:27.315 --> 19:29.833
THEY TEASED ME
AT THE SENIOR CENTER TODAY.

19:29.901 --> 19:32.970
METAL MOUTH,
BRACE FACE.

19:33.037 --> 19:35.472
THEY WERE AS CRUEL
AS THEY WERE CLEVER.

19:35.539 --> 19:39.393
WELL, THESE BRACES
ARE COMING OFF RIGHT NOW.

19:39.461 --> 19:40.794
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

19:40.862 --> 19:43.096
HEY, I SPENT $3,800
ON YOUR BRACES,

19:43.164 --> 19:45.265
AND I'M ABOUT TO SPEND
A COUPLE GRAND MORE

19:45.333 --> 19:47.601
ON A PART OF CARRIE'S BODY
THAT I DON'T EVEN LOOK AT!

19:48.453 --> 19:50.003
YOU PUT THEM DOWN!

19:50.071 --> 19:52.840
MY BODY, MY CHOICE.

19:52.907 --> 19:54.024
AAH!
ARTHUR!

19:54.059 --> 19:57.911
YEAH, SO CAN YOU GIVE ME,
LIKE, KELLY RIPA'S CALVES?

19:57.979 --> 19:59.246
GIVE 'EM TO ME!
NO!

20:00.515 --> 20:01.782
OW!
YOU BIT ME!

20:01.850 --> 20:04.351
I HOPE YOU HAVE
A TETANUS SHOT.

20:06.137 --> 20:07.604
NO, NO,
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

20:07.672 --> 20:09.372
THAT'S-THAT'S JUST THE TV.

20:09.441 --> 20:12.042
AHEM. SO HOW'S WEDNESDAY?

20:38.653 --> 20:40.370
HEY, HEY.
HEY, HEY.
