WEBVTT

00:01.744 --> 00:03.161
My name is Elena Gilbert.

00:03.163 --> 00:04.579
I'm a new vampire and there
have been complications...

00:04.580 --> 00:05.980
I know that I'm sired
to you, Damon.

00:05.982 --> 00:07.532
You know what would
make me happy?

00:07.534 --> 00:09.617
That what you actually
felt for me was real.

00:09.619 --> 00:11.703
But there's hope now.
There's a cure.

00:11.705 --> 00:13.454
And we're
as close to finding it

00:13.456 --> 00:14.822
as we've ever been.

00:14.824 --> 00:16.123
Here we go.

00:16.126 --> 00:18.459
We've
traveled far from home,

00:18.461 --> 00:20.595
where the cure is buried
with an ancient evil.

00:20.597 --> 00:22.046
What do you know
about Silas?

00:22.048 --> 00:23.998
He's the world's
first immortal being,

00:24.000 --> 00:25.566
and I want to free him.

00:25.568 --> 00:28.252
If Silas rises,
he'll unleash hell on earth.

00:28.254 --> 00:30.471
The search
has been dangerous.

00:32.107 --> 00:33.975
Loyalties have been tested.

00:33.977 --> 00:36.444
I don't care about some
lame-ass cure for vampires.

00:36.446 --> 00:38.613
How can you say that
right now?

00:38.615 --> 00:42.016
Because I don't want
you to be cured.

00:42.018 --> 00:43.901
I can keep expression
from consuming you.

00:43.903 --> 00:46.788
Downside is, you turned her into
a bomb that only you can dismantle.

00:46.790 --> 00:48.573
Now Bonnie has
to keep me alive.

00:48.575 --> 00:50.158
What the hell's
going on?

00:50.160 --> 00:52.543
The gang's
all here. Silas awaits.

00:52.545 --> 00:54.361
The cure is within our reach,

00:54.363 --> 00:56.438
but we're not the only ones
looking for it.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.467
You're one of the 5.

00:59.469 --> 01:01.586
Aah!

01:03.000 --> 01:09.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:17.437 --> 01:20.154
Something bothering you?

01:20.156 --> 01:21.823
Would you believe me
if I said mosquitoes?

01:21.825 --> 01:24.375
Oh, aye, I would.
How does it feel when

01:24.377 --> 01:27.078
a relentless eating machine is
draining the blood from your veins?

01:27.080 --> 01:29.030
Itchy.

01:29.032 --> 01:32.617
Your friends from Mystic Falls
think you're funny, Damon?

01:32.619 --> 01:34.585
You obviously know who
I am and where I'm from.

01:34.587 --> 01:36.921
- Have you been spying on me?
- Aye.

01:36.923 --> 01:38.739
I have.

01:38.741 --> 01:41.125
You and Stefan,

01:41.127 --> 01:42.343
Elena,

01:42.345 --> 01:43.961
your witch, Bonnie.

01:43.963 --> 01:45.680
Do you need her to cast
the spell written

01:45.682 --> 01:47.748
on your pal Jeremy's
hunter's mark...

01:49.234 --> 01:51.443
A tattoo that looks
exactly like this?

01:53.722 --> 01:56.023
You want to know
something, just ask.

01:56.025 --> 01:58.192
I've been killing
vampires my entire life.

01:58.194 --> 02:02.113
Still, this thing refused
to reveal itself to me.

02:02.115 --> 02:04.699
That was, until 3 days ago,
and it just magically

02:04.701 --> 02:06.734
completed for
no apparent reason.

02:06.736 --> 02:09.770
Come on, man. Do I look like
I know anything about tattoos?

02:09.771 --> 02:12.290
Look at my skin.
It's flawless.

02:12.292 --> 02:15.326
Ah, you're not
taking me seriously.

02:15.328 --> 02:17.962
I don't blame you.

02:17.964 --> 02:19.845
You don't know me.

02:21.717 --> 02:23.918
So let me
introduce myself.

02:28.056 --> 02:30.842
My name is
Galen Vaughn,

02:30.844 --> 02:33.926
and you'd better
start talking.

02:33.927 --> 02:38.576
<font color="#00ffff">Sync & corrections by Rafael UPD</font>
<font color="#00ffff">www.addic7ed.com/</font>

02:39.068 --> 02:41.686
- Tell me you're not serious.
- I wish I weren't.

02:41.688 --> 02:42.987
When we got back
from looking for Jeremy,

02:42.989 --> 02:45.139
Shane and Bonnie were
both gone, too.

02:45.141 --> 02:48.659
Shane needs Bonnie to cast a spell on
Jeremy's tattoo in order to find the cure,

02:48.661 --> 02:51.357
and he managed to sneak them
both out from under our noses.

02:51.358 --> 02:53.865
- Well, where's Damon in all this?
- We had an argument.

02:53.867 --> 02:55.750
I thought he was just
taking a walk, but then

02:55.752 --> 02:57.335
when we went to the beach,
we saw signs of a struggle.

02:57.337 --> 02:59.337
Meaning what?

02:59.339 --> 03:01.122
Meaning somebody probably
jumped him and then grabbed him.

03:01.124 --> 03:02.874
Do you think
Shane took him?

03:02.876 --> 03:05.209
No, I mean, he's not strong
enough to take Damon on,

03:05.211 --> 03:06.794
even with the element
of surprise.

03:06.796 --> 03:08.162
He must have someone

03:08.164 --> 03:09.964
or at least a few
someones helping him.

03:09.966 --> 03:12.767
I am so sorry.
I wish I was there to help.

03:12.769 --> 03:14.669
Well, maybe there's
something you can do from home.

03:14.671 --> 03:16.220
Anything. Tell me.

03:16.222 --> 03:18.272
So Shane's looking for the cure.
We think we can find him.

03:18.274 --> 03:20.057
We have pictures
of Jeremy's tattoo,

03:20.059 --> 03:21.859
but we just can't
translate the map.

03:21.861 --> 03:24.779
Unless you get
the hunter's sword from Klaus.

03:24.781 --> 03:26.347
Exactly.

03:26.349 --> 03:28.566
He'll never
give up the sword.

03:28.568 --> 03:29.784
Yeah, but if anyone's
gonna get him

03:29.786 --> 03:31.185
to give it up,
it's Caroline.

03:31.187 --> 03:32.620
He will never
give up the sword,

03:32.622 --> 03:34.005
not even for Caroline.

03:34.007 --> 03:36.040
He's terrified we'll use
the cure against him

03:36.042 --> 03:38.359
to make him mortal, and even if he
wasn't, he wouldn't want any of us

03:38.361 --> 03:40.711
to derive a moment's worth
of happiness from being human.

03:40.713 --> 03:42.747
Well, maybe he doesn't
have to give it up.

03:42.749 --> 03:45.132
Klaus is stuck in Elena's
house by Bonnie's spell.

03:45.134 --> 03:47.171
He can't go anywhere.

03:47.172 --> 03:49.837
There's only so many places you
can hide a 3-foot piece of metal.

03:49.839 --> 03:51.305
I'll find it. Don't worry.

03:51.307 --> 03:53.257
Just email me photos
of Jeremy's tattoo.

03:53.259 --> 03:55.142
I'll find the sword
and I'll call you back.

03:55.144 --> 03:56.844
Thank you, Caroline.

03:56.846 --> 03:58.396
Bye.

03:58.398 --> 04:02.061
- Need my help with anything, love?
- Nope.

04:37.752 --> 04:39.720
This is as far
as I go.

04:39.722 --> 04:42.723
We're on the brink of a monumental
event in human history.

04:42.725 --> 04:45.426
We're gonna raise the most powerful
immortal creature that ever was.

04:45.428 --> 04:46.927
Come on, our work's
not done yet.

04:46.929 --> 04:49.063
Mine is. You said get
the kid and the witch.

04:49.065 --> 04:51.399
I did. I want
to get paid now.

05:11.352 --> 05:14.255
I'll say a prayer
for your souls.

05:16.291 --> 05:18.442
That's what
the tombstone was for?

05:18.444 --> 05:19.944
To pay off a mercenary?

05:19.946 --> 05:21.329
The core of
that tombstone is made up

05:21.331 --> 05:23.597
of Qetsiyah's
calcified blood.

05:23.599 --> 05:26.434
In some witch circles,
that stone's more

05:26.436 --> 05:29.120
valuable than
the hope diamond.

05:30.972 --> 05:33.324
So...

05:35.460 --> 05:38.140
So who wants
to go down first?

05:41.453 --> 05:44.402
Well, if it isn't
little orphan Lockwood.

05:44.404 --> 05:47.872
Come to show how laughably
impotent you are against me?

05:47.874 --> 05:50.374
I'm just trying to help
my friends find the cure.

05:50.376 --> 05:52.927
Found this
in your attic.

05:52.929 --> 05:55.930
And you think
finding the sword

05:55.932 --> 05:57.965
brings you closer
to the cure?

05:57.967 --> 05:59.266
You tell me.

05:59.268 --> 06:00.634
I was playing around
with the handle

06:00.636 --> 06:02.436
on the ride over...

06:02.438 --> 06:04.555
And I found this.

06:08.777 --> 06:12.391
And what do you
think this is?

06:12.392 --> 06:14.516
It's called a cryptex.

06:14.517 --> 06:16.514
I've seen
"The Da Vinci Code."

06:16.515 --> 06:18.352
You turn the different sides
to the different symbols

06:18.354 --> 06:20.854
to get the translation
on the other side.

06:20.856 --> 06:22.873
And, with the magic
of the Internet,

06:22.875 --> 06:25.594
Elena sent over these.

06:25.595 --> 06:27.828
So now all we have
to do is cryptex away.

06:27.830 --> 06:31.916
If you happened to want to help,
we wouldn't stop you.

06:31.918 --> 06:35.419
Right. Well, might I suggest
using the magic of the Internet

06:35.421 --> 06:38.005
to purchase
an Aramaic-to-English dictionary

06:38.007 --> 06:39.696
from your nearest
retailer?

06:39.697 --> 06:43.394
- What's Aramaic?
- It's a dead language.

06:43.396 --> 06:46.514
It hasn't been used since,
like, biblical times.

06:46.516 --> 06:49.049
Qetsiyah's native
tongue, I'm guessing.

06:49.051 --> 06:53.571
You know, even if you had
the best dictionary in the world,

06:53.573 --> 06:56.833
it could take days
to translate...

06:58.244 --> 07:00.070
Perhaps weeks.

07:01.197 --> 07:04.582
"In bas so-teen-too
ara-ma-eet."

07:05.584 --> 07:07.618
What does that mean?

07:07.620 --> 07:10.871
"If only you spoke
Aramaic."

07:21.082 --> 07:23.551
And, once again,

07:23.553 --> 07:26.053
everyone's life is in
danger looking for this cure

07:26.055 --> 07:29.557
because poor Elena can't
deal with being a vampire.

07:29.559 --> 07:32.560
No, everyone's here
because they want to be.

07:32.562 --> 07:35.229
Not just for you,
but for themselves, too.

07:35.231 --> 07:38.482
Stefan, why didn't you tell me that
you wanted the cure for yourself?

07:38.484 --> 07:41.435
I mean, why wouldn't
I want to take it?

07:41.437 --> 07:44.438
I've seen every side
of vampirism there is.

07:44.440 --> 07:48.959
The power...
The misery, the guilt.

07:48.961 --> 07:52.779
In the long run, even
the good parts kind of suck, too.

07:52.781 --> 07:56.333
Yeah, I mean, I know why you
would want to take it, but...

07:56.335 --> 08:00.588
All I'm saying is...
Why didn't you tell me?

08:00.590 --> 08:03.557
'Cause it had nothing
to do with you.

08:03.559 --> 08:06.760
I mean, you know how much
I wanted a human life with you,

08:06.762 --> 08:09.063
being human myself,

08:09.065 --> 08:11.432
being normal...

08:11.434 --> 08:15.152
that's something I've wanted
since long before I met you.

08:15.154 --> 08:17.471
Well, I'm glad
you told me now.

08:17.473 --> 08:21.692
Yeah, what's a deeply buried personal
secret between friends, right?

08:21.694 --> 08:25.794
Between friends?
I like that.

08:32.788 --> 08:35.322
Mind telling me
where we're going?

08:35.323 --> 08:38.342
At the wishing well lies
an entrance to a crypt.

08:38.344 --> 08:40.660
In the crypt lies Silas.

08:40.663 --> 08:42.663
And with Silas lies
the cure,

08:42.664 --> 08:44.632
which will allow me
to kill Silas,

08:44.634 --> 08:48.135
bring the mission of
the brotherhood of the 5 to an end.

08:48.137 --> 08:50.437
You're my leverage, Damon;
I use you to get

08:50.439 --> 08:53.807
your witch friend to open
the passage to Silas' crypt for me.

08:53.809 --> 08:56.527
Wait a minute. You're using
me to get to Bonnie Bennett?

08:56.529 --> 08:58.512
Whoa, brother. Heh!

08:58.514 --> 09:00.514
You picked
the wrong vampire.

09:00.516 --> 09:02.783
I guess we'll see
about that.

09:02.785 --> 09:04.518
Here's the deal,
Shrek.

09:04.520 --> 09:06.237
My witch friend will open
the passage for you.

09:06.239 --> 09:07.571
No leverage necessary.

09:07.573 --> 09:09.073
We don't care
about Silas.

09:09.075 --> 09:10.741
All we want is the cure,
so you cut us in

09:10.743 --> 09:13.377
on your share, we'll
get out of your hair.

09:13.379 --> 09:16.697
You really don't
understand, do you?

09:18.166 --> 09:19.583
Ok, this is it.

09:19.585 --> 09:22.586
We've translated all
the symbols on the tattoo.

09:22.588 --> 09:29.393
"Passage inside... Requires
a young senator

09:29.395 --> 09:31.378
and a pretty flower."

09:31.380 --> 09:33.697
Ok, none of this
makes sense.

09:33.699 --> 09:35.716
No,
I don't understand,

09:35.718 --> 09:37.434
so why don't you
explain it?

09:37.436 --> 09:39.236
Silas is immortal.

09:39.238 --> 09:41.855
I have to cram the cure down
his throat in order to kill him.

09:41.857 --> 09:44.491
Yeah, what does it have to
do with me and my friends?

09:49.247 --> 09:53.200
"Requires a powerful witch
and a hunter in full bloom."

09:53.202 --> 09:54.702
What are you doing?

09:54.704 --> 09:56.787
I don't need to
tell you my reasons.

09:56.789 --> 09:58.706
Caroline.

09:58.708 --> 10:00.240
Bring my sword
over here.

10:00.242 --> 10:03.711
I need to use
the cure against Silas.

10:03.713 --> 10:07.040
Your friends, they can't
exactly have it, now, can they?

10:07.041 --> 10:10.217
So you use it on Silas, and we'll
use it for whoever wants to use it.

10:10.219 --> 10:12.721
"Silas rests
on the far side,

10:12.722 --> 10:15.556
the means of his
destruction at hand."

10:22.147 --> 10:24.648
Turn the cryptex
to the right.

10:24.650 --> 10:26.233
Stop.

10:26.235 --> 10:28.202
The top of the hilt

10:28.204 --> 10:30.321
reveals a key
to a nautical map.

10:30.323 --> 10:32.573
Turn it to the left.

10:34.326 --> 10:36.076
Now turn
the other piece.

10:37.579 --> 10:41.498
Wait. There's
something else.

10:41.500 --> 10:42.716
You don't want
to share it with us?

10:42.718 --> 10:44.802
Even if I wanted to,
I couldn't.

10:44.804 --> 10:46.670
And why can't you
share it?

10:46.672 --> 10:47.938
So it is written.

10:54.679 --> 10:56.218
What does it mean?

10:57.582 --> 10:59.284
Klaus,
what does it mean?

11:01.236 --> 11:03.070
There is only
one dose.

11:17.286 --> 11:20.521
- You ok?
- Yeah, I just slipped.

11:20.523 --> 11:23.524
Oh.

11:25.212 --> 11:26.794
Oh!

11:26.796 --> 11:28.880
Ah-ah-ah-ah.

11:36.195 --> 11:38.256
It's ok.

11:38.258 --> 11:40.258
Thanks.

11:46.415 --> 11:48.933
Hey, guys,
I'm coming down.

11:48.935 --> 11:50.202
Hey, Bon.

11:50.203 --> 11:51.769
What do you think's
gonna happen

11:51.771 --> 11:53.621
once you cast
a spell on my tattoo

11:53.623 --> 11:56.441
and there's nothing in
between Shane and Silas?

11:56.443 --> 11:58.974
- Do you trust me?
- Yeah, of course.

11:58.975 --> 12:02.580
Then trust me when I promise
I won't let Shane raise Silas.

12:02.582 --> 12:05.583
Just don't do
anything stupid.

12:05.585 --> 12:07.552
If your expression
gets out of hand,

12:07.554 --> 12:10.004
Shane is the only one that could
help you keep it in control.

12:10.006 --> 12:12.740
Don't worry about me.
I'm fine.

12:12.742 --> 12:16.992
But if Shane tries to lift a finger on
his hand to hurt either one of us...

12:18.614 --> 12:20.459
I'll kill him myself.

12:53.300 --> 12:54.866
- Hello?
- Hey, it's Caroline.

12:54.868 --> 12:56.668
We have the translation
of the tattoo.

12:56.670 --> 12:58.086
We're emailing you
pictures of the map

12:58.088 --> 12:59.887
and instructions
right now.

13:02.809 --> 13:04.642
Got it. Thanks.

13:04.644 --> 13:06.477
Actually, it was me.

13:06.479 --> 13:07.762
Nik, you helped?

13:07.764 --> 13:10.264
You sound so surprised,
little sister.

13:10.266 --> 13:13.300
Shouldn't I be? I mean, you
don't want me to be human.

13:13.302 --> 13:15.903
You don't want any of us to be human.
Why would you help us find the cure?

13:15.905 --> 13:19.007
Maybe I finally realized the longer
I stand in the way of what you want,

13:19.009 --> 13:21.308
the longer you'll
continue to hate me.

13:21.310 --> 13:24.746
Perhaps I want my sister
to finally know happiness.

13:24.748 --> 13:27.749
Fool me once, shame on you;
Fool me a hundred times...

13:27.751 --> 13:31.786
No more fooling.
No more games.

13:31.788 --> 13:35.039
I hope you get to live,

13:35.041 --> 13:38.198
and die, as you wish.

13:39.828 --> 13:41.996
So do I.

13:41.998 --> 13:46.341
There is one more
thing, Rebekah.

13:48.078 --> 13:49.554
There is only
one dose of the cure.

13:49.556 --> 13:50.855
You need to find it
fast and take it.

13:50.857 --> 13:52.807
It's the only way you'll...

13:55.343 --> 13:58.045
Nik. Nik!

14:02.785 --> 14:04.452
You touch me again...

14:04.454 --> 14:06.454
And you'll what?
Threaten me?

14:06.456 --> 14:08.956
Sorry if you're upset
about the cure, Damon,

14:08.958 --> 14:10.658
but we've got road
to cover.

14:10.660 --> 14:12.960
I don't care about
the cure.

14:12.962 --> 14:15.880
In fact, I don't know why anyone
wouldn't want to be a vampire.

14:15.882 --> 14:17.799
You know what?
If I wasn't a vampire,

14:17.801 --> 14:19.500
then I wouldn't be able
to do 9 of the things

14:19.502 --> 14:21.219
I'm gonna do to you
when I'm free.

14:22.537 --> 14:25.055
- Make that 10.
- Right.

14:26.381 --> 14:28.259
All right,
I admit, ok?

14:28.261 --> 14:29.894
My friends want
the cure,

14:29.896 --> 14:31.879
and I want them
to have it,

14:31.881 --> 14:34.922
and I get very upset when
I can't provide for my loved ones.

14:34.923 --> 14:36.984
But tell me something,
Vaughn, if all you're

14:36.986 --> 14:38.686
worried about is Bonnie
the teenage witch,

14:38.688 --> 14:40.655
then why'd you save Jeremy
and Elena yesterday?

14:40.657 --> 14:42.273
- How did I do that?
- Big guy.

14:42.275 --> 14:43.524
White paint
all over him.

14:43.526 --> 14:45.276
Stuck a hatchet
in his spine.

14:45.278 --> 14:46.694
I don't remember doing
such a thing.

14:48.448 --> 14:49.897
We're on
a remote island.

14:49.899 --> 14:52.566
There's you, me,
and a bunch of unpleasant locals.

14:52.568 --> 14:54.952
You expect me to believe
that someone else

14:54.954 --> 14:57.004
took out that monster
truck of a human being

14:57.006 --> 14:58.673
that went after
Jeremy and Elena?

14:58.675 --> 15:01.209
I'm telling you,
it wasn't me.

15:10.769 --> 15:12.470
Was that you?

15:12.472 --> 15:14.772
No. You?

15:14.774 --> 15:16.774
No.

15:18.593 --> 15:21.779
I reckon there really is
someone else on this island.

15:24.766 --> 15:28.069
It's just amazing,
isn't it?

15:30.873 --> 15:32.874
Once we raise Silas,
all of our sacrifices

15:32.876 --> 15:34.909
will have been worthwhile;
We'll all have what we want.

15:34.911 --> 15:36.461
Or he'll kill us all.

15:36.463 --> 15:38.412
Listen, you're gonna
see I'm right.

15:38.414 --> 15:40.131
Just so you don't get
any ideas, remember,

15:40.133 --> 15:42.049
anything happens to me, something
a lot worse will happen to you.

15:42.051 --> 15:45.452
All right. Where's this stupid
magic passage she needs to open?

15:45.454 --> 15:47.505
Just look for anything
that looks out of place,

15:47.507 --> 15:49.790
all right? Anything not
occurring in nature,

15:49.792 --> 15:52.960
like a drawing
or an inscription or...

15:54.847 --> 15:57.648
Geometrically
perfect circle.

16:04.806 --> 16:06.274
This is it.

16:06.276 --> 16:08.910
This is the spot.

16:12.531 --> 16:13.948
What did Caroline say?

16:13.950 --> 16:15.500
I don't know.
We lost the signal.

16:15.502 --> 16:17.668
Come on. This way.

16:23.094 --> 16:25.042
We need to
get down and across.

16:25.044 --> 16:26.677
Advantage,
vampires:

16:26.679 --> 16:28.162
All we have
to do is jump.

16:28.164 --> 16:30.047
Wait, wait. Um...

16:30.049 --> 16:32.016
Maybe you should
leave the map behind.

16:32.018 --> 16:33.434
In case you fall,
you don't want

16:33.436 --> 16:34.685
anything to happen
to the phone.

16:34.687 --> 16:35.937
Are we doing this
again?

16:35.939 --> 16:37.171
I thought
we were a team.

16:37.173 --> 16:38.639
Guys, we don't have
time for this.

16:38.641 --> 16:39.941
Elena, you go first.

16:39.943 --> 16:41.309
We'll be right
behind you.

16:58.276 --> 17:01.250
There's something you
should know about the cure.

17:07.669 --> 17:09.587
Now you're doing it.
Just breathe,

17:09.589 --> 17:11.489
all right? Focus on
what you can do.

17:11.491 --> 17:13.383
Don't be afraid
of what you can't.

17:13.384 --> 17:14.854
You can do this.

17:14.855 --> 17:16.984
Remember, just like
you taught me.

17:16.986 --> 17:19.262
You're in control.

17:24.598 --> 17:27.088
That's it.
It's just like drawing breath.

17:27.089 --> 17:29.106
Now just pull
the power into you.

17:48.176 --> 17:51.751
Looks like your witch
is casting her spell.

18:16.438 --> 18:19.322
So you're sure that Klaus
is telling the truth,

18:19.324 --> 18:21.814
that there is only
one dose of the cure?

18:24.862 --> 18:28.114
Well, I guess that's what happens when
you're dumb enough to hold out hope.

18:28.116 --> 18:30.250
There's still hope
for one of us,

18:30.252 --> 18:32.902
but even if I felt
pity for you,

18:32.904 --> 18:36.923
if I wanted to ease your pain so I gave
you the cure to take for yourself,

18:36.925 --> 18:39.132
you'd give it to Elena,
wouldn't you?

18:43.431 --> 18:45.547
That's what I thought.

18:47.718 --> 18:51.308
Well, I'm sorry that it couldn't
work out the way we all wanted it to.

18:58.980 --> 19:01.314
Bonnie!

19:04.101 --> 19:06.086
Bonnie!

19:06.088 --> 19:08.738
I'm fine.

19:10.878 --> 19:13.043
Here. Heh!

19:13.045 --> 19:15.078
Look.

19:15.080 --> 19:18.048
It worked.

19:18.050 --> 19:21.000
You did it.

19:21.002 --> 19:23.376
We did it.

19:29.177 --> 19:31.177
Hey, guys, c...

19:31.179 --> 19:33.897
I need a hand.
My leg's broken.

19:33.899 --> 19:36.799
Best to stay
off it, then.

19:36.801 --> 19:37.984
Bonnie.

19:37.986 --> 19:39.235
Wait, wait. Don't...

19:39.237 --> 19:40.787
Come on. Bonnie!

19:40.789 --> 19:43.073
Help me! Come on!
Please!

19:43.075 --> 19:44.941
Help me!

19:50.331 --> 19:53.083
Well, here we are.

19:53.085 --> 19:55.919
Looks like someone
beat us to the punch.

19:55.921 --> 19:57.871
That's a shame, Damon.

19:57.873 --> 19:59.923
I have no use
for you anymore.

19:59.925 --> 20:01.424
Hate to kill ya.

20:01.426 --> 20:04.794
Ditto. You know,
that pesky hunter's curse and all.

20:04.796 --> 20:06.713
All right.

20:06.715 --> 20:08.715
How do you want
to do this?

20:08.717 --> 20:11.101
I'll make it quick
and painless.

20:13.471 --> 20:16.172
Wish I could make
the same promise.

20:22.012 --> 20:23.363
Ow!

20:25.534 --> 20:28.451
I'm gonna kill you.

20:28.453 --> 20:30.904
And then I'm gonna get
to that damn cure,

20:30.906 --> 20:32.372
and I'm gonna give it
to the girl that I love.

20:32.374 --> 20:35.325
Your attachment to your friends
will be the end of you.

20:38.797 --> 20:41.047
You don't know
my friends...

20:44.368 --> 20:46.302
Or my enemies.

20:53.094 --> 20:55.061
There's only one cure?

20:57.748 --> 21:00.066
I can't take it.
I mean,

21:00.068 --> 21:03.853
not above everyone else who
deserves it just as much as I do.

21:05.890 --> 21:08.992
It's over.

21:08.994 --> 21:10.827
I'm sorry.

21:10.829 --> 21:14.638
Don't be.
Maybe it's a blessing in disguise.

21:14.639 --> 21:16.358
How so?

21:16.359 --> 21:19.571
Things changed the minute that
I went off that bridge, Stefan.

21:19.572 --> 21:21.875
Even if I could be
human again,

21:23.238 --> 21:25.960
I wouldn't be the person
that I was.

21:28.212 --> 21:31.914
So it's about time that I accept
the person that I am now

21:31.916 --> 21:36.759
and figure out a way... To start
living the rest of my life.

21:38.189 --> 21:41.191
The rest of your life...

21:41.193 --> 21:43.518
Sired to Damon.

21:46.430 --> 21:49.535
I guess we'll have to deal
with that when I get home.

21:53.192 --> 21:55.605
Oh, my God...

21:55.607 --> 21:57.991
Home. Klaus.

21:57.993 --> 21:59.775
Bonnie's spell isn't
gonna hold him.

21:59.777 --> 22:01.628
And after what we did to Kol,
if we don't ram

22:01.630 --> 22:04.998
that cure down his throat,
he'll kill us all.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.250
Pity party over.
We have to go.

22:09.921 --> 22:11.921
Every time I think
I have him,

22:11.923 --> 22:13.339
that son of a bitch
gets the upper hand.

22:13.341 --> 22:14.674
We won't let him
hurt you.

22:14.676 --> 22:17.060
Stefan and Elena will
bring back the cure.

22:17.062 --> 22:18.511
If they get to it first.

22:18.513 --> 22:20.480
And if they don't,
Klaus kills me.

22:20.482 --> 22:22.565
I need to get out of town to figure
out how I'm gonna stay alive...

22:22.567 --> 22:24.150
Wait, hang on, ok?
Gosh!

22:24.152 --> 22:26.936
Before you get
all doomsday, just...

22:26.938 --> 22:30.406
at least let me try
and talk to him.

22:30.408 --> 22:32.025
He's got nothing
to lose, Care.

22:32.027 --> 22:34.143
His brother's dead,
his hybrids are gone.

22:34.145 --> 22:36.446
All he wants right now is blood,
starting with mine.

22:36.448 --> 22:39.412
I'm not gonna say good-bye to
you again, do you understand me?

22:41.368 --> 22:43.773
Let me fix this.

22:50.076 --> 22:52.545
Are we gonna dance
or are we gonna play?

22:52.547 --> 22:55.965
You know he can't hurt me, Damon,
unless he's got the white oak stake.

22:55.967 --> 22:58.268
Oh, he doesn't,
but he's got other toys.

23:17.122 --> 23:18.788
Damon!

23:30.241 --> 23:33.460
You're wasting time.
Just get the cure. Go.

23:33.462 --> 23:35.045
We're not gonna leave you.

23:35.047 --> 23:36.446
No, we aren't.

23:36.448 --> 23:39.749
You need to go ahead.
We'll be right behind you.

23:39.751 --> 23:41.618
Go.

23:49.594 --> 23:52.145
Look at us.

23:52.147 --> 23:55.782
A newbie hunter and a witch
who needs adult supervision.

23:55.784 --> 23:58.718
How are we the ones
that made it this far?

24:01.122 --> 24:03.773
I'm glad we're here
together.

24:05.192 --> 24:07.542
Me, too.

24:12.483 --> 24:15.502
Where is "here,"
exactly?

24:16.663 --> 24:18.555
This way.

24:18.557 --> 24:20.724
How do you know?

24:22.159 --> 24:23.743
I just know.

24:23.745 --> 24:26.613
Hello, Bonnie.

24:29.133 --> 24:31.301
Hi, grams.

24:33.721 --> 24:36.106
What are you doing
here, grams?

24:36.108 --> 24:39.442
This place allows
the living to talk to the dead.

24:39.444 --> 24:41.144
Bonnie,
what's going on?

24:41.146 --> 24:43.179
I am so sorry

24:43.181 --> 24:45.031
about what happened.

24:45.033 --> 24:47.751
It's ok.
You're here now.

24:47.753 --> 24:52.789
And you are this close to
bringing me back to life for good.

24:52.791 --> 24:54.574
How?

24:54.576 --> 24:56.576
Silas can do it.

24:56.578 --> 25:01.598
All you have to do is
reach him and feed him,

25:01.600 --> 25:04.384
and everything will go back
to the way it was.

25:05.920 --> 25:07.554
Bonnie, stop!

25:07.556 --> 25:10.223
Hey, you're not seeing
your grams.

25:10.225 --> 25:13.143
If she were here, I'd be
able to see her, and I can't.

25:13.145 --> 25:16.229
It's not her ghost.
It's a hallucination.

25:16.231 --> 25:19.149
What you're seeing,
it isn't real.

25:19.151 --> 25:22.185
It's me. Your grams
isn't here.

25:22.187 --> 25:26.356
I'm here. I'm real, ok?

25:31.229 --> 25:33.730
Jer...

25:33.732 --> 25:35.782
What happened?

25:35.784 --> 25:37.734
Silas.

25:37.736 --> 25:40.253
He was in your head.

25:40.255 --> 25:42.622
He was trying
to control you.

25:42.624 --> 25:44.624
And Shane.

25:44.626 --> 25:47.277
Illusions of his wife.

25:47.279 --> 25:49.746
That's how Silas
controls him.

25:49.748 --> 25:53.166
You need to block him
out of your mind.

25:53.168 --> 25:55.694
Close your eyes.

25:57.722 --> 26:00.016
Listen to my voice
and only my voice.

26:02.823 --> 26:05.154
I'm gonna get us
there.

26:26.834 --> 26:28.985
You can't kill Tyler.

26:28.987 --> 26:31.454
Not only can I,
I have to.

26:31.456 --> 26:33.840
I have a reputation
to uphold.

26:33.842 --> 26:37.761
Moreover, I want to.

26:37.763 --> 26:40.463
I'm not asking you
to forgive him.

26:40.465 --> 26:43.617
All I'm asking is that
you let him live,

26:43.618 --> 26:45.436
somewhere far from here.

26:46.771 --> 26:48.822
So he gets to live
a happy life

26:48.824 --> 26:51.741
after he turned all
my hybrids against me,

26:51.743 --> 26:54.744
after he tried
to kill me,

26:54.746 --> 26:56.696
after he made it
his life's mission

26:56.698 --> 26:58.665
to find the cure
so he could use it against me...

26:58.667 --> 27:01.766
- We all want the cure.
- Do we?

27:03.571 --> 27:05.238
Do you?

27:05.240 --> 27:06.906
It doesn't matter.
There's only one,

27:06.908 --> 27:08.775
so it's not like I'm
gonna get it anyway.

27:08.777 --> 27:10.660
But if you could...

27:12.279 --> 27:15.498
You wouldn't,
would you?

27:16.784 --> 27:18.835
You prefer
who you are now

27:18.837 --> 27:21.538
to the girl
you once were.

27:21.540 --> 27:24.624
You like being
strong,

27:24.626 --> 27:27.293
ageless,

27:27.295 --> 27:29.796
fearless.

27:34.735 --> 27:38.638
We're the same,
Caroline.

27:39.824 --> 27:42.175
Then show me.

27:43.511 --> 27:46.496
You know how much
I love Tyler.

27:46.498 --> 27:51.201
You can see how scared
I am to lose him.

27:51.203 --> 27:54.562
If you and I are so similar,
then show me your compassion.

27:56.457 --> 28:00.910
Show him the mercy
that I would show you.

28:00.912 --> 28:03.513
Mercy...

28:03.515 --> 28:06.523
For Tyler?

28:09.220 --> 28:11.170
Very well.

28:11.172 --> 28:14.390
Tell him to leave town immediately.

28:15.526 --> 28:18.228
And tell him
to run and hide

28:18.230 --> 28:20.313
in a place I will
never find him.

28:20.315 --> 28:22.482
Of course.

28:24.819 --> 28:27.520
Tell him that this
is the mercy

28:27.522 --> 28:30.957
I extend
for your sake...

28:30.959 --> 28:33.693
That I will give him
a head start

28:33.695 --> 28:36.184
before I kill him.

28:43.338 --> 28:45.705
All right, come on.
We have to catch up.

28:45.707 --> 28:47.707
No, it's ok.
I just need a minute.

28:47.709 --> 28:50.543
I'm only gonna
slow you down. Go.

28:50.545 --> 28:52.562
She only needs
one of us.

28:52.564 --> 28:54.714
And what? You don't care
to be that one anymore?

28:54.716 --> 28:57.650
You finally decided it was
easier to just walk away?

28:57.652 --> 28:59.652
There's only one dose
of the cure, Stefan.

28:59.654 --> 29:03.890
If she wants to take it,
you want her to.

29:03.892 --> 29:05.575
I don't.

29:05.577 --> 29:07.410
Just do what makes her
happy, Stefan.

29:07.412 --> 29:09.729
Things have changed.
It's not that easy anymore.

29:09.731 --> 29:11.698
It is right now.

29:11.700 --> 29:13.500
Get your ass down
the well.

29:13.502 --> 29:16.402
Help Elena get
the damn thing.

29:17.955 --> 29:19.802
Come on.

29:39.861 --> 29:43.062
Stefan?

29:49.270 --> 29:51.270
Hello?

29:51.272 --> 29:53.990
Elena.

30:04.501 --> 30:05.869
No.

30:14.390 --> 30:17.091
How many times are
we gonna have to say good-bye?

30:18.611 --> 30:22.397
At least this time we have
a minute to do it the right way.

30:23.600 --> 30:26.300
There isn't a right way.

30:28.471 --> 30:30.438
This isn't good-bye.

30:30.440 --> 30:35.095
This is...
Until we find a way.

30:35.096 --> 30:37.895
We're immortal,
remember?

30:37.897 --> 30:41.115
We will find a way.

30:43.953 --> 30:46.170
What if we don't?

30:49.024 --> 30:51.993
Tell me that you'll
never think of me again.

30:51.995 --> 30:54.996
Tell me that you'll forget about
me, tell me that you are gonna go on

30:54.998 --> 30:58.466
and live a full and
happy life without me.

31:11.280 --> 31:14.206
I will live a happy
life without you.

31:15.985 --> 31:19.020
I will forget
all about you.

31:21.007 --> 31:23.691
And I will never,

31:23.693 --> 31:27.412
ever... Think
about you again.

31:51.654 --> 31:54.221
Until we find a way.

32:28.057 --> 32:32.143
Hey, I don't suppose you'd want to
share a little of that vampire blood.

32:32.145 --> 32:33.811
Where are Jeremy
and Bonnie?

32:33.813 --> 32:36.097
I have no idea.

32:37.733 --> 32:39.283
Stop lying!

32:39.285 --> 32:42.704
I'm not lying...

32:42.706 --> 32:46.657
But if you help me, I will take
you the rest of the way, I promise.

32:46.659 --> 32:49.210
Did you know this whole time
that there was only one cure?

32:49.212 --> 32:51.796
What? No.

32:54.616 --> 32:57.151
How could I?
I've never seen it.

33:00.723 --> 33:05.459
Look, everything I ever said and did was
just to bring back my family, I swear.

33:07.229 --> 33:10.681
Well, then you know what
it's like to have hope,

33:10.683 --> 33:13.851
and now you know what it
feels like to lose it.

33:13.853 --> 33:18.108
Come on. Come on!

33:26.381 --> 33:28.613
Caitlin.

33:28.614 --> 33:31.002
I'm sorry, Caitlin.

33:31.004 --> 33:33.788
- I failed you.
- No.

33:33.790 --> 33:36.724
You didn't.

33:36.726 --> 33:39.043
I'm sorry.

33:39.045 --> 33:42.013
- I tried.
- Shh.

33:42.015 --> 33:45.216
You did everything
I asked you to.

33:45.218 --> 33:48.603
Everything is going
to be just fine.

34:28.226 --> 34:29.927
Is this it?

34:29.929 --> 34:31.596
This is the cure?

34:31.598 --> 34:34.748
How is that supposed to cure
every vampire in the world?

34:34.751 --> 34:36.818
I don't think
it is, Jer.

34:44.726 --> 34:47.360
It's stuck.
Help me move it.

34:53.400 --> 34:56.286
It's, like,
fossilized in place.

34:56.289 --> 34:58.039
Oh.

34:58.041 --> 35:00.374
It's like trying
to bend stone.

35:02.245 --> 35:04.178
Oh, my God.

35:04.180 --> 35:06.547
What?

35:11.970 --> 35:14.255
What, Bonnie?

35:14.257 --> 35:19.861
He's been frozen like
a vampire statue for 2,000 years.

35:19.863 --> 35:23.314
There's only one way we're gonna
get this statue to unfreeze.

35:23.316 --> 35:25.032
How's that?

35:25.034 --> 35:27.318
We have to feed him
our blood.

35:28.787 --> 35:32.773
If we want to get the cure
out of his hands, we...

35:32.775 --> 35:35.417
We have to wake him up.

35:51.459 --> 35:53.644
Oh.

36:05.791 --> 36:07.742
You're alive.

36:07.744 --> 36:10.344
- Yeah.
- Why didn't you go with them?

36:10.346 --> 36:12.997
Needed a siesta.

36:12.999 --> 36:16.200
- You gave up, didn't you?
- I didn't give up.

36:17.921 --> 36:20.204
I just realized...

36:20.206 --> 36:22.790
You can't control
everything...

36:24.761 --> 36:27.211
No matter
how hard you try.

36:27.213 --> 36:30.381
Let's just say I made
peace with that fact.

36:34.169 --> 36:35.741
Peace?

36:35.742 --> 36:37.471
You love Elena.

36:37.473 --> 36:39.240
You always will.

36:39.242 --> 36:43.194
If she becomes human, she may
not feel the same way about you.

36:43.196 --> 36:45.563
You'll never know peace.

36:45.565 --> 36:48.232
Life sucks.

36:48.234 --> 36:50.799
Get a helmet.

36:52.871 --> 36:55.206
You did something
selfless, Damon.

36:55.208 --> 36:57.875
If I didn't know
better, I'd say

36:57.877 --> 37:00.881
you were becoming
a halfway decent person.

37:03.198 --> 37:04.915
Ah, come on!

37:04.917 --> 37:08.336
There's got to be a way to
do this without raising him.

37:10.339 --> 37:12.640
We'll find a way...

37:16.441 --> 37:18.562
Don't listen
to the witch, boy.

37:18.563 --> 37:20.815
We have to raise
Silas,

37:20.817 --> 37:23.250
and we have
to do it now.

37:27.086 --> 37:28.227
Bonnie!

37:32.847 --> 37:34.097
What are you doing?

37:34.099 --> 37:36.133
What you should have
done already.

37:36.135 --> 37:38.101
I'm gonna raise Silas...

37:38.103 --> 37:40.220
Then I'm gonna kill him.

37:45.310 --> 37:47.227
You're a bit confused,
Mr. Gilbert.

37:47.229 --> 37:49.229
We're on
the same team here.

37:49.231 --> 37:51.148
Aah!

37:51.150 --> 37:53.438
You stabbed my friend!

37:55.646 --> 37:57.197
I don't mess around
with witches.

37:57.199 --> 37:59.899
You can't use
the cure on Silas.

37:59.901 --> 38:01.568
It's what it's
meant for!

38:13.965 --> 38:16.800
What else
would you use it for?

38:18.002 --> 38:20.220
Your friends...

38:21.389 --> 38:23.056
Your sister...

38:23.058 --> 38:24.257
Sorry, lad.

38:24.259 --> 38:27.310
It wasn't meant for that.

38:29.546 --> 38:31.731
Nothing personal.

38:33.601 --> 38:35.652
Don't!
The hunter's curse!

38:42.443 --> 38:44.077
You ok?

38:53.255 --> 38:55.421
How did you get out?

38:55.423 --> 38:59.509
I fear something awful has
befallen your friend Bonnie.

39:01.245 --> 39:05.181
Don't worry, love.
You know I'd never hurt you.

39:05.183 --> 39:06.549
You've done enough.

39:06.551 --> 39:08.935
I've done more
than enough.

39:08.937 --> 39:11.437
I've shown kindness,

39:11.439 --> 39:13.973
forgiveness,

39:13.975 --> 39:16.059
pity...

39:16.061 --> 39:18.661
Because of you,
Caroline.

39:18.663 --> 39:21.431
It was all for you.

40:02.406 --> 40:03.606
Elena.

40:06.278 --> 40:08.328
What happened?
She's here!

40:08.330 --> 40:09.529
Who?

40:15.586 --> 40:18.705
Elena's here now, ok?
Everything's gonna be all right.

40:18.707 --> 40:20.656
We did it.

40:23.928 --> 40:26.162
Come on. We got
to get you up.

40:26.164 --> 40:28.631
You have to help Bonnie. The hunter
stabbed her. You have to feed her.

40:28.633 --> 40:31.517
Ok. I just need to make
sure that you're ok first.

40:31.519 --> 40:33.303
I'm fine.
What are you doing?

40:33.305 --> 40:34.971
The cure.

40:34.973 --> 40:37.023
Jeremy, after everything
we've been through,

40:37.025 --> 40:38.308
it's right there.

40:38.310 --> 40:42.028
It'll be there
after we help Bonnie.

40:42.030 --> 40:44.614
God, I forgot what
a brat you were.

40:44.616 --> 40:46.349
What?

40:46.351 --> 40:47.734
I'm done playing nice.

40:47.736 --> 40:49.352
Ah!

40:52.623 --> 40:53.873
Katherine.

40:53.875 --> 40:56.242
It's been too long,
little Gilbert.

40:58.528 --> 41:03.249
Sorry. Family reunion is
gonna have to be cut short.
