Replacement team's here, sir.

01:08.151 --> 01:10.444
Right. Come on through!

01:12.947 --> 01:15.032
We were gonna start
looking for you guys.

01:15.241 --> 01:17.451
God, it's really something out there.

01:17.660 --> 01:18.744
[Man] You look a mess, sir.

01:19.746 --> 01:22.664
Yeah? Your turn next, Ginsberg.

01:29.672 --> 01:31.048
OK, bye. See you in 24.

01:31.883 --> 01:32.883
See you tomorrow.

01:37.555 --> 01:38.722
What were you saying?

01:38.932 --> 01:41.266
I used to hear her
chant all night long...

01:41.434 --> 01:43.560
[repeating chant]

01:45.105 --> 01:46.105
Over the plants?

01:46.314 --> 01:49.358
She'd cup her hands over the seeds
and chant by the hour.

01:49.567 --> 01:52.694
She grew the most
beautiful wandoos you ever saw.

Your mother's been very worried.
Roads must be a bear.

02:14.342 --> 02:16.260
- What roads?
- Visibility.

02:17.137 --> 02:21.598
Visibility, bullshit. You haven't
been on time for the last six months.

02:21.808 --> 02:23.392
I wrote you up in the log book.

02:23.601 --> 02:24.935
Yeah, you're a prince.

02:39.826 --> 02:41.702

02:41.911 --> 02:45.747
Sinsemillia. This grass made
Thai stick taste like oregano.

- Let's do it. Insert launch key.
- Stand by.

04:35.984 --> 04:38.360
- Launch key inserted.
- Roger.

04:38.528 --> 04:39.987
On my mark.

04:58.798 --> 05:00.590
Roger, at "set."

05:06.973 --> 05:08.223
- Sir?
- [Man over speaker] T minus 40.

05:08.433 --> 05:09.891
All right, enable missiles.

05:10.310 --> 05:13.729
Number one, enabled.
Two, enabled. Three, enabled. Four...

05:13.896 --> 05:15.689
- I wanna get this straight.

- It's not the correct procedure.

05:32.081 --> 05:34.666
SAC. Try SAC headquarters on the HF.

05:34.834 --> 05:37.210
- That's not the procedure.
- Screw the procedure.

05:37.420 --> 05:40.839

before I kill 20 million people.

I got nothing here.

05:48.348 --> 05:50.682
It might've been knocked out already.

05:50.933 --> 05:52.059
All right.

05:52.894 --> 05:55.854
On my mark, rotate
launch keys to "launch."

- Sir, we have a launch order.

...three, two...
- Put your hand on the key.

06:13.956 --> 06:15.957
...one. Launch.

06:19.295 --> 06:23.173
- We are at launch, turn your key!
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

06:23.383 --> 06:25.717
Turn your key, sir!

08:15.912 --> 08:17.412

08:21.125 --> 08:22.083
Hello, I'm Pat Healy.

08:22.251 --> 08:25.337
I'm Lyle Watson,
this is Arthur Cabot.

08:25.505 --> 08:28.256
[Pat laughs]
I'm Dr. McKittrick's assistant.

08:28.424 --> 08:30.258
We've got some passes for you.

08:30.718 --> 08:33.010
We've scheduled a meeting
on your arrival.

08:33.221 --> 08:36.056
If you have any questions,
feel free to ask me,

08:36.265 --> 08:37.933
I'd be happy to fill you in.

08:38.100 --> 08:40.769
[Alarm bell ringing]

09:01.916 --> 09:05.293
- [Computers beeping]

09:23.479 --> 09:26.356

- [Rapid beeping]

09:34.448 --> 09:35.657
They're here.

09:36.367 --> 09:37.367
Good.

09:38.035 --> 09:39.244
Let's go.

09:41.330 --> 09:44.916
Cabot and Watson came alone.
No senators, no congressmen.

09:45.084 --> 09:47.460
- I wish they'd brought senators.
- What?

09:47.628 --> 09:49.087
To tell them what goes on.

09:49.255 --> 09:52.507
John, please,
don't start that right away.

09:52.675 --> 09:54.593
I had them on the phone, they're calm.

09:56.679 --> 09:58.305
Look now, are we positive

09:58.472 --> 10:02.267
that these men had no way
of knowing this was only a test?

10:02.476 --> 10:05.937
Lyle, how many times
are we gonna go through this?

10:06.105 --> 10:07.397
It doesn't matter.

10:07.565 --> 10:11.526
I've spoken to each of these men.
They all thought it was the real deal.

10:12.111 --> 10:14.779
We have to be on a plane
in less than an hour.

10:14.947 --> 10:16.781
I have to explain to the president

10:16.991 --> 10:21.119
why 22 percent of his missile commanders
failed to launch their missiles.

10:21.287 --> 10:23.997
What am I supposed
to tell him, 22 percent isn't so bad?

10:24.165 --> 10:28.710
The president knows that I am fully
responsible for the men in my command.

10:28.878 --> 10:32.589
I've ordered a revaluation of our
psychological screening procedure.

10:32.757 --> 10:35.050
Wait a minute. Excuse me, general.

10:35.217 --> 10:38.303
We can't ask these men
to go back to the president

10:38.471 --> 10:40.764
with a lot of head-shrinker horseshit!

10:40.931 --> 10:42.724
You can't screen out human response.

10:42.892 --> 10:46.102
Those men know what
it means to turn the keys

10:46.270 --> 10:47.729
and some are not up to it!

10:48.230 --> 10:50.023
Now, it's as simple as that!

10:54.737 --> 10:56.863
We ought to take
the men out of the loop.

10:57.031 --> 10:59.991
- Mr. McKittrick, you're out of line.
- Why?

11:00.159 --> 11:02.369
- Wait. Excuse me.
- [John] What are you talking about?

11:03.621 --> 11:06.998
I'm sorry. What do you mean,
take them out of the loop?

11:07.166 --> 11:10.752
Gentlemen, we've
had men in these silos

11:10.920 --> 11:13.713
since before any of you
were watching Howdy Doody.

11:15.383 --> 11:18.677
[Chuckles] For myself,
I sleep well at night,

11:18.844 --> 11:20.679
knowing those boys are down there.

11:20.846 --> 11:22.847
General, we all know they're fine men.

11:23.015 --> 11:27.769
But in a nuclear war, we can't have
our missiles lying in those silos

11:27.937 --> 11:31.731
because they refuse to turn the
keys when the computers tell them to!

11:31.941 --> 11:34.609
You mean, when
the president orders them to.

11:34.777 --> 11:38.405
The president probably follows
the computer war plan. That's a fact!

11:38.572 --> 11:41.950
Well, I imagine the joint chiefs
will have some input.

11:42.118 --> 11:43.118
You're damned tooting.

11:43.285 --> 11:47.205
Well, the Soviets launch
a surprise attack, there's no time.

11:47.373 --> 11:49.999
[Pat] Twenty-three minutes
from warning to impact.

11:50.668 --> 11:52.293
Six minutes, if sub-launched.

11:52.461 --> 11:57.090
Six minutes, that's barely enough time
for the president to make a decision.

11:57.299 --> 12:00.135
Once he makes that decision,
the computer takes over.

12:01.887 --> 12:04.389
I know that you've
got a plane waiting,

12:04.557 --> 12:07.642
but if you give me five minutes,
I'll show you something.

12:15.776 --> 12:18.695
These computers give us
access to the world.

12:18.863 --> 12:22.115
Troop movements, Soviet missile tests,
shifting weather patterns.

12:22.283 --> 12:26.369
It all flows into this room and then
into what we call the WOPR computer.

12:26.537 --> 12:27.662
WOPR, what is that?

12:27.830 --> 12:30.123
The War Operation Plan Response.

12:30.291 --> 12:34.002
This is Mr. Richter. Paul, would you
tell these gentlemen about the WOPR?

12:34.170 --> 12:37.839
[Clears throat]
Well, the WOPR spends all its time

12:38.007 --> 12:40.383
thinking about World War III.

12:40.551 --> 12:44.679
Twenty-four hours a day,
365 days a year,

12:44.847 --> 12:47.682
it plays an endless
series of war games

12:47.850 --> 12:51.352
using all available information
on the state of the world.

12:51.979 --> 12:55.857
The WOPR has already
fought World War III as a game

12:56.025 --> 12:57.567
time and time again.

12:58.027 --> 13:00.904
It estimates Soviet
responses to our responses,

13:01.071 --> 13:03.490
to their responses and so on.

13:03.657 --> 13:08.912
Estimates damage, counts the dead,
and looks for ways to improve the score.

13:09.079 --> 13:12.040
But the point is that the key
decisions of every conceivable option

13:12.208 --> 13:14.709
in a nuclear crisis
have been made by the WOPR.

13:14.877 --> 13:17.545
You're saying that this
trillion dollar hardware

13:17.713 --> 13:20.548
is at the mercy
of those men with the brass keys.

13:20.716 --> 13:22.550
[John] That's exactly right.

13:22.718 --> 13:24.928
Whose only problem
is that they're human.

13:25.095 --> 13:28.389
But in 30 days we could
replace them with electronic relays.

13:28.557 --> 13:29.974
Get the men out of the loop.

13:30.142 --> 13:31.351
[General] Gentlemen...

13:32.812 --> 13:35.605
...I wouldn't trust
this pile of microchips

13:35.773 --> 13:37.565
any further than I could throw it.

13:37.733 --> 13:40.235
I don't trust
the safety of our country

13:40.402 --> 13:43.154
to some silicon diode.

13:43.322 --> 13:45.824
General, nobody
is talking about entrusting

13:45.991 --> 13:49.077
the safety of the nation
to a machine, for God's sake.

13:49.245 --> 13:52.247
We'll keep control,
but we'll keep it here at the top.

13:52.414 --> 13:58.002
Gentlemen... I'll recommend
McKittrick's idea to the president.

13:58.170 --> 14:00.463
And I'll get back to you on this.

14:01.757 --> 14:02.757
Thank you.

14:02.925 --> 14:04.509
You won't regret this.

- How's it going?
- Pretty good.

15:01.191 --> 15:03.818

- Sure.

16:19.186 --> 16:23.147

about nitrogen nodules that we don't?

16:23.732 --> 16:27.068

to which you alone are privy?

16:28.404 --> 16:29.862
- No.
- [Teacher] I see.

No, you didn't know
the correct answer, symbiosis,

pay attention in class.

[Laughter]

17:06.066 --> 17:07.525
Miss Mack!

17:07.693 --> 17:09.277
- Yes?
- What is so amusing?

17:09.444 --> 17:10.444
[Laughs]

17:13.490 --> 17:14.906
What?

17:15.701 --> 17:17.452
All right, Lightman.

17:18.787 --> 17:23.082
Could you tell us who first suggested
the idea of reproduction without sex?

17:23.250 --> 17:24.666
Um...

17:24.835 --> 17:28.128
- Your wife?
- [Laughter]

17:29.673 --> 17:31.841
Get out, Lightman.
Get out.

17:33.385 --> 17:35.803
[School bell rings]

17:40.476 --> 17:44.145
Mr. Ligget wants me to discuss my
attitude problem with Mr. Kessler.

17:44.313 --> 17:47.690
Mr. Kessler's tired
of discussing your attitude problem.

17:48.275 --> 17:49.275
Me too.

17:50.736 --> 17:52.820
[Buzzer sounds]

18:20.474 --> 18:23.684
Lightman. What a surprise.

18:23.852 --> 18:25.061
Won't you come in?

18:40.911 --> 18:42.745
- Hi. [laughs]
- Whoa!

18:42.913 --> 18:43.955
Hi.

18:44.123 --> 18:47.125
Sorry if I got you in trouble.
I couldn't stop laughing.

18:47.292 --> 18:49.210
That's OK. You were perfect.

18:49.378 --> 18:51.003
- I was?
- Yeah.

18:51.755 --> 18:53.089
You want a ride home?

18:53.257 --> 18:54.423
Yeah.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.343
Hop on.

19:01.306 --> 19:03.432
- [David] Whoa!
- [Jennifer laughs]

19:05.185 --> 19:08.271
- You got an F on that test today too?
- Yep.

19:08.438 --> 19:10.606
We're gonna be stuck
in summer school.

19:10.774 --> 19:14.694
- Not me.
- Why not? You have to make up biology.

19:14.862 --> 19:16.279
I don't think so.

19:16.446 --> 19:17.780
Why not?

19:18.782 --> 19:21.159
Why not? Come on, tell me.

19:21.326 --> 19:22.785
Make a left.

19:22.953 --> 19:26.455
- Come up to my house and I'll show you.
- What are you gonna show me?

19:26.623 --> 19:30.877
- I'll show you how to do it.
- [Dog barks]

19:32.254 --> 19:35.339
- Hi, Bo.
- Oh, hi, Bo!

19:35.507 --> 19:37.800
[Both continue talking to dog]

19:40.304 --> 19:43.222
Bo! Bo! Bo...

19:55.360 --> 19:56.402
Her room's upstairs.

19:56.570 --> 19:59.113
- Your parents aren't home?
- No, they both work.

20:13.212 --> 20:15.213
Ooh! Oh...

20:17.883 --> 20:19.634
Little mess.

20:19.801 --> 20:22.553
It's OK.
You should see my room.

20:30.145 --> 20:31.395
[Computer beeps]

20:31.563 --> 20:34.357
- You're really into computers, huh?
- Yeah.

20:38.946 --> 20:39.904
[Dial tone, phone dialing]

20:40.072 --> 20:43.449
- What are you doing?
- Dialing into the school's computer.

20:45.202 --> 20:48.663
[Line ringing, beeping]

20:52.084 --> 20:53.960
[Rapid beeping]

20:55.712 --> 20:59.757
[David] They change the password,
but I know where they write it down.

21:04.096 --> 21:06.931
- [Typing]
- [Computer beeping]

21:14.147 --> 21:16.774
- Are those your grades?
- Yep.

21:17.234 --> 21:19.610
I don't think that
I deserved an F. Do you?

21:23.532 --> 21:24.782
You can't do that!

21:25.534 --> 21:26.701
Already done.

21:28.704 --> 21:31.831
- Do you have a middle initial?
- "K," Katherine.

21:37.462 --> 21:39.213
These are my grades.

21:40.048 --> 21:42.258
How can anybody get a D in Home Ec?

21:42.426 --> 21:43.884
None of your business.

21:44.052 --> 21:46.304
- Can you erase this, please?
- It's too late.

21:47.389 --> 21:49.724
- What are you doing?
- Changing your grade.

21:49.891 --> 21:51.517
I don't want you to do that.

21:51.685 --> 21:54.395
[David] Nobody can find out.

21:54.563 --> 21:56.856
You got a C!
No need for summer school.

21:57.024 --> 21:59.066
- Change it back!
- They can't...

21:59.234 --> 22:00.818
I said change it back.

22:00.986 --> 22:02.403
OK, OK.

22:10.579 --> 22:12.121
I guess I better get going.

22:14.249 --> 22:15.708
Thanks for the ride.

22:16.251 --> 22:18.377
Yeah, OK. Bye.

22:18.754 --> 22:20.212
Bye.

23:05.217 --> 23:08.552
[Computer humming]

23:15.519 --> 23:17.353
[Beeping]

23:20.524 --> 23:22.483
- Get down.
- You've got to see it!

23:22.651 --> 23:23.818
- You had your dinner.
- [Dog whining]

23:23.985 --> 23:26.695
Two bedrooms, a bath
and a half, and a bonus room.

23:26.863 --> 23:28.656
Don't forget the garbage.

23:28.824 --> 23:32.076
Put that lid on tight so Bo
doesn't dump over the trash.

23:32.244 --> 23:34.328
- I know, Ma.
- Sh!

23:34.496 --> 23:37.331
Yes, they will
carry back on the second.

23:38.500 --> 23:41.877
Sure, I think we can really
work out some creative financing.

23:43.046 --> 23:47.174
You've gotta see it. There's
a Jacuzzi in the master bedroom.

23:47.342 --> 23:48.968
You know what that means.

23:49.136 --> 23:51.971
I mean, those jets,
they really work, you know.

23:52.139 --> 23:54.598
[Mother continues indistinctly]

23:54.766 --> 23:56.267
You are so naughty.

23:56.435 --> 23:58.686
[Mother laughing]

23:59.354 --> 24:01.897
[Mother] Oh, sure. We can work that out.

24:03.525 --> 24:07.611
That is true. You're gonna have
a balloon payment in five years,

24:07.779 --> 24:10.156
but the economy will be great then.

24:10.323 --> 24:11.365
[David] Bo, come here.

24:11.533 --> 24:13.784
[Mother] He who dances
must pay the price, right?

24:13.952 --> 24:17.288
That's wonderful.
I'll meet you tomorrow at 9:30. Bye.

24:20.709 --> 24:22.751
You know, I worry about that kid.

24:22.919 --> 24:24.044
Why?

24:25.839 --> 24:28.883
Sometimes I think
we're all gonna get electrocuted.

24:29.050 --> 24:30.634
Ha!

24:30.802 --> 24:33.012
- [Crunches]
- [Gags]

24:33.722 --> 24:35.139
This corn is raw!

24:35.307 --> 24:36.974
I know. Isn't it wonderful?

24:37.142 --> 24:39.894
- It's so crisp.
- Of course it's crisp, it's raw!

24:40.061 --> 24:44.106
No, it's terrific. You can just taste
the vitamin A and D. It's great.

24:45.066 --> 24:47.526
Could we have pills and cook the corn?

24:48.153 --> 24:49.653
[Operator] What city, please?

24:49.821 --> 24:53.073
For Sunnyvale, California.
The number for Protovision.

24:53.658 --> 24:56.827
Yes. That's 555-8632.

24:58.163 --> 25:02.374
Thank you. And could you also tell me
what other prefixes cover that area?

25:02.542 --> 25:05.336
There's 399, 437,

25:05.504 --> 25:09.256
- 767, 936.
- Thanks.

25:22.896 --> 25:24.438
[Dial tone]

25:24.606 --> 25:27.066
Protovision, I have you now.

25:27.234 --> 25:29.151
[Computer beeping]

25:45.585 --> 25:47.628
[Line ringing]

25:48.630 --> 25:49.755
[Man on phone] Hello.

25:51.466 --> 25:53.342
[Line ringing]

25:56.304 --> 25:57.680
[Man 2] Saul's Fish Market.

25:59.099 --> 26:00.849
[Line ringing]

26:10.652 --> 26:11.610
Hi.

26:11.778 --> 26:13.112
Oh, hi.

26:16.616 --> 26:17.324
What?

26:17.993 --> 26:20.327
I've been thinking about my grade.

26:20.495 --> 26:21.829
Can you still change it?

26:21.997 --> 26:25.332
- Oh, I don't know.
- I should've just let you do it.

26:27.294 --> 26:28.919
It might be kind of rough.

26:29.087 --> 26:30.296
- Why?
- Why?

26:31.006 --> 26:32.631
They can change the password.

26:32.799 --> 26:35.092
Maybe they didn't. Can't we try?

26:37.929 --> 26:39.930
- Damn!
- Please?

26:41.182 --> 26:43.183
- OK.
- OK.

26:43.351 --> 26:47.021
- You owe me a quarter.
- Yeah. Sorry you lost your game.

26:47.188 --> 26:50.232
[Beeping]

26:51.359 --> 26:53.736
[Door opens]

26:54.821 --> 26:56.322
What's it doing?

26:56.489 --> 26:57.865
It's dialing numbers.

27:01.828 --> 27:04.371
- Don't touch the keys!
- I'm not touching the keys.

27:05.707 --> 27:06.790
Excuse me.

27:07.792 --> 27:11.587
This computer company is coming out
with new games in a few months.

27:11.755 --> 27:14.590
The programs for them
are still in their computer.

27:14.758 --> 27:15.924
I told my system

27:16.092 --> 27:19.428
to search for other
computers in Sunnyvale, California.

27:23.350 --> 27:27.227
They answer with a tone that
other computers recognize. Hear?

27:27.395 --> 27:28.562
[Beeping]

27:28.730 --> 27:30.272
You're calling
every number in Sunnyvale?

27:34.319 --> 27:36.445
- Isn't that expensive?
- There's ways around that.

27:37.822 --> 27:41.241
- You can go to jail for that.
- Only if you're over 18.

27:43.286 --> 27:46.246
Will this take a long time?
I'd like to get my grade changed.

27:47.248 --> 27:48.457
[Chuckles nervously]

27:48.625 --> 27:50.918
That's funny, actually, because...

27:52.462 --> 27:54.171
...I already changed it.

27:55.674 --> 27:57.091
I told you not to do that.

27:57.258 --> 28:00.928
Yeah, I know, but
I figured you'd change your mind.

28:01.096 --> 28:02.513
I didn't want you to flunk.

28:03.473 --> 28:04.473
What did I get?

28:05.183 --> 28:07.851
- You got a D.
- You gave me a D?

28:08.019 --> 28:09.019
No, you got an A.

28:09.187 --> 28:11.271
- I was kidding.
- Oh.

28:11.815 --> 28:13.190
That's OK.

28:13.900 --> 28:15.734
Here. Let's see what we have so far.

28:17.404 --> 28:18.445
Excuse me.

28:18.697 --> 28:21.782
- Did you really give me an A?
- Yeah.

28:23.618 --> 28:26.120
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

28:26.287 --> 28:28.622
[Low beeping]

28:32.127 --> 28:33.168
Hey, you got a bank.

28:33.336 --> 28:36.296
Gotta make a note of that.
Might come in handy someday.

28:42.470 --> 28:43.512
Pan Am.

28:44.597 --> 28:46.223
Where should we go?

28:46.391 --> 28:48.142
- Anywhere?
- Anywhere.

28:48.309 --> 28:49.560
- New York?
- OK...

28:49.728 --> 28:51.562
- No, Paris!
- Paris. OK.

28:57.193 --> 28:58.944
Will you be traveling alone?

28:59.112 --> 29:01.655
Yeah. No. You wanna go with me?

29:01.823 --> 29:04.658
OK. Uh...

29:05.410 --> 29:07.494
All right. Smoking or nonsmoking?

29:07.662 --> 29:09.747
- Nonsmoking.
- Nonsmoking.

29:10.665 --> 29:14.793
All right, Miss Mack. You're
confirmed on Pan Am's flight 114,

29:14.961 --> 29:17.087
leaving Chicago's O'Hare Airport

29:17.255 --> 29:19.882
at 8:15 a.m. On 18 August.

29:20.049 --> 29:22.843
Do we need a rental car? No.

29:23.011 --> 29:24.052
We have tickets to Paris?

29:24.220 --> 29:26.430
No, you have a reservation though.

29:26.598 --> 29:28.307
- [Beeping]
- [Scoffs]

29:35.148 --> 29:36.982
Doesn't identify itself.

29:37.150 --> 29:38.150
Huh...

29:38.318 --> 29:39.485
Try anything.

29:45.700 --> 29:48.452
"Connection terminated." How rude.

29:49.370 --> 29:51.371
- I'll ask it for help.
- Can you do that?

29:51.539 --> 29:52.706
On some systems.

29:52.874 --> 29:55.709
The more complicated they are,
the more they help you.

30:04.219 --> 30:05.511
Now what?

30:07.222 --> 30:08.639
"Help games."

30:08.807 --> 30:11.058
- [Typing]
- [Beeping]

30:14.604 --> 30:16.772
"Games refers to models,
simulations and games

30:16.940 --> 30:19.233
having tactical
and strategic applications."

30:19.400 --> 30:21.151
- What's that?
- It's gotta be them.

30:21.319 --> 30:23.904
Turn on the printer.
I want to get a printout of this.

30:24.864 --> 30:26.448
"List games."

30:28.159 --> 30:30.869
[Beeping]

30:32.831 --> 30:34.540
[Chuckles]

30:50.765 --> 30:52.432
Oh, my God.

31:03.528 --> 31:06.029
These guys can tell you
what that printout means?

31:06.197 --> 31:08.740
Yeah. They probably
invented it in the first place.

31:12.120 --> 31:16.248
[Computers humming, clattering]

31:28.678 --> 31:30.304
- Can you wait here?
- Why?

31:30.471 --> 31:32.764
These guys can get a little nervous.

31:42.525 --> 31:43.525
Jim.

31:44.569 --> 31:45.861
Oh, Lightman.

31:46.029 --> 31:47.446
[Laughs]

31:50.116 --> 31:51.533
Hi, Lightman!

31:52.327 --> 31:54.119
I want you to take a look at this.

32:00.710 --> 32:03.170
- What's that?
- I wanted Jim to see that.

32:06.633 --> 32:07.883
Wow! Where'd you get this?

32:08.051 --> 32:11.678
I tried to break into Protovision.
I wanted to see the new games.

32:11.846 --> 32:13.972
- Can I have this?
- Wait, I'm not through yet.

32:17.185 --> 32:21.396
Remember you told me to tell you when
you're acting rudely and insensitively?

32:21.564 --> 32:22.856
You're doing it now.

32:29.614 --> 32:32.908
"Theaterwide biotoxic
and chemical warfare."

32:34.535 --> 32:35.953
This isn't from Protovision.

32:36.120 --> 32:38.664
You bet it isn't.
Ask him where it came from.

32:38.831 --> 32:40.040
I told you already.

32:40.208 --> 32:43.835
Looks military to me. Definitely
military, probably classified.

32:44.003 --> 32:47.047
If it's military, why does
it have checkers and backgammon?

32:47.215 --> 32:49.424
[Jim] Maybe because they
teach basic strategy.

32:50.843 --> 32:53.845
How do I get into that system?
I want to play those games.

32:54.013 --> 32:55.681
[Man] You can't see that stuff!

32:55.848 --> 32:59.351
That system has a data encryption
algorithm. You'll never get in!

32:59.519 --> 33:02.270
I don't believe that
any system is totally secure.

33:02.772 --> 33:06.066
- I bet you Jim could get in.
- [Man] I bet you he couldn't.

33:06.234 --> 33:10.445
You'll never get in through frontline
security, but look for a back door.

33:10.613 --> 33:14.658
I can't believe it! She's over there
and you tell him about our back door?

33:14.826 --> 33:19.579
Mr. Potato Head!
Back doors are not secrets!

33:19.747 --> 33:21.623
You're giving away our best tricks.

33:21.791 --> 33:24.710
- [Jim] They're not tricks.
- What's a back door?

33:24.877 --> 33:29.297
When I design a system, I put in a
simple password that only I know about.

33:29.465 --> 33:32.175
Whenever I want to get back in,

33:32.343 --> 33:34.970
I can bypass whatever security
they've added on.

33:35.138 --> 33:37.139
That's basically what it is.

33:38.349 --> 33:39.808
Yeah?

33:39.976 --> 33:43.854
You really want to get in, find out
about the guy who designed the system.

33:44.022 --> 33:46.231
Come on, I don't
even know the guy's name.

33:46.399 --> 33:49.401
Boy, are you guys dumb.
You're so dumb.

33:49.569 --> 33:51.987
I got this thing figured out
all by myself.

33:52.155 --> 33:54.197
Oh, yeah, Malvin?
How would you do it?

33:54.365 --> 33:58.285
The first game on the list.
Go right through Falken's Maze.

34:16.179 --> 34:18.929
- [Beeping]
- [Typing]

34:23.643 --> 34:24.686
[Buzzer sounds]

34:46.583 --> 34:49.628
[Beeping]

34:53.882 --> 34:55.132
[Buzzer sounds]

35:15.905 --> 35:18.615
[Printer whirring]

35:30.795 --> 35:33.755

[Dog barking]

35:51.983 --> 35:54.568

35:55.736 --> 35:59.781
- [Dog whining]
- [Cooing to dog]

36:04.745 --> 36:06.955
Hi! I'm Jennifer.

36:07.123 --> 36:08.874
- Is David here?
- How do you do?

36:09.041 --> 36:10.625
Yeah. He's up in his room.

36:12.920 --> 36:14.254
Thanks.

36:14.964 --> 36:17.424
Have you ever heard
of the word "tumulus"?

36:17.592 --> 36:20.051
Tumulus. No, I haven't. Sorry.

36:20.219 --> 36:21.428
Neither have I.

36:23.431 --> 36:24.890
[Knocking on door]

36:25.057 --> 36:26.141
Yeah.

36:27.101 --> 36:29.102
Hi!

36:29.270 --> 36:30.937
- Where have you been?
- What?

36:31.689 --> 36:34.357
I haven't seen you in school.
Are you sick?

36:35.484 --> 36:39.738
Oh... No. I was doing things.

36:39.906 --> 36:41.573
You want to sit? How are you?

36:41.741 --> 36:44.117
No, I'm gonna get some water, OK?

36:44.285 --> 36:47.996
- What is all that stuff?
- It's nothing. I was just...

36:48.164 --> 36:52.459
I tried to find out more about the guy
who designed those game programs...

36:52.627 --> 36:54.461
...so I could get his secret password.

36:55.254 --> 36:57.714
- Why?
- Why? Because...

36:57.882 --> 37:00.800
What's so special about
playing games with some machine?

37:00.968 --> 37:03.803
Oh, no. No, it's
not just some machine.

37:04.889 --> 37:06.473
Here, look at this.

37:07.975 --> 37:11.645
This is a tape I got from the library.
It's about this guy named Falken.

37:14.190 --> 37:16.441
He was into games,
as well as computers.

37:17.818 --> 37:21.780
He designed them so that they
could play checkers or poker, chess.

37:21.948 --> 37:23.865
What's so great about that?

37:24.033 --> 37:25.283
Oh, no.

37:25.451 --> 37:27.160
What he did was great.

37:27.328 --> 37:31.122
He designed this computer so that
it could learn from its own mistakes.

37:31.290 --> 37:33.458
So they're better
the next time they played.

37:33.626 --> 37:35.835
The system actually learned
how to learn.

37:37.255 --> 37:38.463
It could teach itself.

37:40.341 --> 37:43.510
If I could just get that damn
password, I could play the computer.

37:46.681 --> 37:48.348
That's him. That's Falken.

37:50.101 --> 37:51.268
That's him?

37:51.936 --> 37:52.894
Wow.

37:53.062 --> 37:55.480
He's amazing looking.

37:56.857 --> 37:59.234
Can't you write to him or call him?

37:59.402 --> 38:00.819
No, he's dead.

38:01.696 --> 38:03.947
- He's dead?
- Yeah.

38:04.115 --> 38:06.032
Here, look. Here's his obituary.

38:07.576 --> 38:08.910
He wasn't very old.

38:09.078 --> 38:11.705
[David] No, he was pretty old.
He was 41.

38:11.872 --> 38:13.999
Oh, yeah? Oh, that's old.

38:16.711 --> 38:18.086
[David] That's his little boy.

38:19.213 --> 38:20.630
Oh, yeah?

38:21.716 --> 38:23.383
This is really sad.

38:24.218 --> 38:26.761
The child and his mother
died in a car crash.

38:26.929 --> 38:27.887
Yeah, I know.

38:28.055 --> 38:30.181
"After the tragic loss
of his family,

38:30.349 --> 38:32.767
Dr. Falken's health deteriorated."

38:40.359 --> 38:42.110
My dad is 45.

38:45.823 --> 38:48.533
- Once he was sick, and we thought...
- What was his name?

38:49.660 --> 38:51.453
My father?

38:51.620 --> 38:53.121
No, no. Falken's kid.

38:55.333 --> 38:56.166
Joshua.

38:58.252 --> 39:00.545
It can't be that simple.

39:00.713 --> 39:03.882
- [Typing]
- [Beeping]

39:09.472 --> 39:11.014
- Wow.
- What?

39:12.016 --> 39:13.308
We got something.

39:15.436 --> 39:18.146
[Computer humming]

39:23.652 --> 39:24.778
We're in!

39:26.364 --> 39:28.365
It thinks I'm Falken.

39:30.284 --> 39:31.618
"Hello."

39:35.414 --> 39:36.748
How can it ask you that?

39:37.208 --> 39:39.292
It'll ask you what it's programmed to.

39:39.460 --> 39:41.294
- Do you want to hear it talk?
- Yeah.

39:43.214 --> 39:44.547
I'll ask how it feels.

39:45.925 --> 39:47.634
"I'm fine.

39:47.802 --> 39:50.553
How are you?"

39:51.639 --> 39:54.182
[Computer] Excellent.
It's been a long time.

39:54.350 --> 39:58.436
Can you explain the removal
of your user account

39:58.604 --> 40:02.524
on June 23, 1973?

40:02.691 --> 40:04.317
They must have told it he died.

40:06.987 --> 40:11.908
"People sometimes make mistakes."

40:12.076 --> 40:15.328
- [Computer] Yes, they do.
- How can it talk?

40:15.496 --> 40:16.996
It's not a real voice.

40:17.164 --> 40:19.999
This box interprets
computer signals into sound.

40:20.167 --> 40:24.129
- Shall we play a game?
- Oh...

40:24.296 --> 40:26.214
[chuckles] I think it missed him.

40:26.382 --> 40:28.091
Yeah. Weird, isn't it?

40:28.259 --> 40:31.177
"Love to. How about...

40:32.012 --> 40:36.057
...Global Thermonuclear War?"

40:37.393 --> 40:41.771
[Computer] Wouldn't you prefer
a good game of chess?

40:41.939 --> 40:44.023
"Later. Let's play...

40:45.401 --> 40:48.319
...Global Thermonuclear War."

40:48.696 --> 40:50.280
Fine.

40:50.448 --> 40:51.698
All right!

40:53.576 --> 40:54.784
Wow.

40:57.997 --> 40:59.914
Which side do you want?

41:02.918 --> 41:04.544
I'll be the Russians.

41:09.258 --> 41:11.342
Please list primary targets.

41:12.094 --> 41:13.803
Who should we nuke first?

41:13.971 --> 41:15.930
Oh, let's see. How about...

41:16.807 --> 41:17.849
...Las Vegas?

41:18.017 --> 41:20.018
Las Vegas. Great!

41:22.771 --> 41:23.813
What next?

41:23.981 --> 41:25.899
- Seattle!
- Yeah! [laughs]

41:33.657 --> 41:36.576
[Beeping]

41:38.704 --> 41:42.832
I have seven... Correction,
eight redbirds two degrees past apogee.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.542
[Alarm blares]

41:44.710 --> 41:46.836
Better get the old man down here.

41:47.004 --> 41:48.838
[Man over PA]
We have a Soviet missile warning.

41:49.006 --> 41:51.716
Check for malfunction
and report confidence.

41:51.884 --> 41:55.929
Projected target areas,
NORAD regions 2526.

41:56.096 --> 41:58.932
[Alarm continues blaring]

42:10.152 --> 42:14.364
All stations, this is Crystal Palace
initiating emergency conference.

42:16.617 --> 42:20.537
19 degrees past apogee,
with possible 18 targets in track.

42:20.704 --> 42:24.123
Estimate reentry at 19-23 Zulu.

42:32.508 --> 42:35.260
- What you got here, Joe?
- We have a radar tracking.

42:35.427 --> 42:38.638
Eight inbound Soviet ICBMs
already over the pole.

42:38.806 --> 42:42.475
Estimated impact, 11 minutes.
Target area, western United States.

42:42.643 --> 42:44.394
Why didn't we get detection?

42:44.562 --> 42:47.063
I'm not sure.
We're checking for DSP malfunction.

42:47.856 --> 42:50.984
BMEWS has continuous
radar tracking on inbounds.

42:51.151 --> 42:55.029
Confidence is high.
I repeat, confidence is high.

42:55.197 --> 42:57.782
[Alarm continues]

43:00.703 --> 43:02.495
- [Jennifer] What is all that?
- [David] I don't know.

43:02.663 --> 43:05.790
"Trajectory headings
for multiple impact reentry vehicles."

43:05.958 --> 43:07.083
What does that mean?

43:07.251 --> 43:09.210
I don't know, but it's great.

43:09.378 --> 43:12.213
- Which is the bombs?
- Subs.

43:12.381 --> 43:14.424
- Want to blow them up?
- Out of the water.

43:14.592 --> 43:17.468
- What's a "trajectory heading"?
- I have no idea.

43:21.265 --> 43:23.516
The president is diverting to Andrews.

43:23.684 --> 43:27.562
The vice president is out of position
and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs...

43:27.730 --> 43:31.107
Missile warning reports no malfunction.
Confidence remains high.

43:31.567 --> 43:35.278
Take us to DEFCON 3.
Get on to SAC.

43:35.446 --> 43:37.822
- Tell them to flush the bombers.
- Yes, sir.

43:37.990 --> 43:39.657
[Buzzer sounds]

43:40.367 --> 43:44.037
SAC, this is Crystal Palace.
CINC NORAD has declared DEFCON 3.

43:44.204 --> 43:48.166
Scramble all alert aircraft.
I repeat, scramble all alert aircraft.

43:49.084 --> 43:50.793
[Over PA] Inbounds presently MIRVing.

43:50.961 --> 43:54.464
We now have approximately
24 possible targets in track.

43:56.383 --> 43:58.009
Time to impact: 8 minutes.

43:58.177 --> 44:01.554
SAC is launching the bombers.
General Powers is on the line.

44:01.722 --> 44:02.847
Beringer.

44:03.724 --> 44:07.518
Goddamn it! We didn't get
a launch detection from our satellite!

44:07.686 --> 44:10.480
No, radar picked them up
out of the atmosphere.

44:10.648 --> 44:12.231
That's the first we heard of it.

44:13.734 --> 44:17.028
Get the ICBMs in the bullpen
warmed up and ready to fly.

44:18.155 --> 44:20.740
- Get me the president on the horn.
- [Man] Yes, sir.

44:22.409 --> 44:23.951
[Dialing]

44:27.081 --> 44:30.667
Mr. President,
this is Beringer at NORAD.

44:31.001 --> 44:32.460
Oh, attack!

44:33.295 --> 44:36.631
- I wonder if I should use my subs.
- Sure. Give them the works.

44:36.799 --> 44:37.965
[Father] David!

44:40.678 --> 44:41.719
Excuse me.

44:42.471 --> 44:43.888
David!

44:45.182 --> 44:49.686
How many times have I said to fasten
these lids on tight? Look at this!

44:49.853 --> 44:51.437
I'll be down in a few minutes.

44:51.605 --> 44:54.190
Now! I want this
cleared up right away!

44:54.358 --> 44:57.235
Come down here and do what
your father asks you to.

44:57.403 --> 44:59.237
Pronto, David.

44:59.947 --> 45:03.199
We're gonna barbecue tonight.
Want to invite your little friend?

45:03.367 --> 45:05.952
- Please.
- David.

45:08.122 --> 45:09.414
Shit.

45:16.630 --> 45:18.381
"Little friend."

45:21.468 --> 45:22.468
[Man] Yes, sir.

45:25.931 --> 45:28.182
Mr. President,
something's happening here.

45:28.350 --> 45:29.600
I'll get back to you.

45:29.768 --> 45:31.269
[Over PA] Reconfirmed.

45:31.437 --> 45:32.645
What's happening?

45:33.647 --> 45:35.148
[Joe] BMEWS and Cobra Dane now report

45:35.315 --> 45:37.775
negative confirmation
on all inbound tracking.

45:40.112 --> 45:42.989
Get on to SAC.
Tell them to hold steady.

45:44.825 --> 45:48.703
Stop! It's a simulation!
It's an attack simulation running!

45:48.871 --> 45:51.289
What's he yelling about?
I didn't order a simulation.

45:51.457 --> 45:54.417
We're not being attacked!
It's a simulation!

45:54.918 --> 45:56.085
Whoa, now! Hold it!

45:56.253 --> 45:58.421
Don't run.
Somebody could get hurt.

45:58.589 --> 46:00.840
I'm sorry.
We don't know how it happened

46:01.008 --> 46:04.719
but someone on the outside fed
an attack simulation into the main.

46:05.888 --> 46:08.306
Conley, take us off full alert.

46:08.474 --> 46:10.892
Hold at DEFCON 4
till we find out exactly

46:11.059 --> 46:13.352
what in the hell's happening here!

46:14.021 --> 46:18.024
I didn't tell you to cut the line!
Did I tell you to? You cut the line!

46:18.192 --> 46:20.568
They shut down before
we completed our trace.

46:20.736 --> 46:24.030
We located the area
where the transmission originated.

46:24.198 --> 46:26.115
- Where?
- Seattle, Washington.

46:26.283 --> 46:27.784
[Paul] Shut it down.

46:27.951 --> 46:30.411
Somebody's playing a game with us.

46:30.746 --> 46:33.456
[Man on TV] The claims began at
a prophylactic recycling center...

46:33.624 --> 46:36.417
- Hi, Dad!
- David!

46:36.877 --> 46:39.337
- David, come in here.
- What did I do?

46:39.505 --> 46:41.714
Plenty, mister, plenty.

46:43.342 --> 46:46.969
You have just passed
all of your classes this semester.

46:47.137 --> 46:49.680
- Congratulations, dear!
- Oh!

46:49.848 --> 46:51.140
Show this to your dad.

46:51.308 --> 46:54.852
Honey, David has something
to show you.

46:55.020 --> 46:56.145
What's that?

46:56.313 --> 46:58.523
- Here, Dad.
- Uh-oh.

46:58.690 --> 47:02.401
[Laughs] This is good.

47:03.362 --> 47:04.695
I'm so proud of you!

47:04.863 --> 47:07.657
[Man on TV]... the U.S. Went on
a full-scale nuclear alert,

47:07.825 --> 47:10.910
believing that the Soviets
launched a surprise missile attack.

47:11.078 --> 47:15.164
A Pentagon spokesman places blame
on a computer malfunction,

47:15.332 --> 47:17.750
assuring that the problem
has been corrected.

47:17.918 --> 47:22.296
For more on the story, let's go live
via satellite to Washington, D.C.

47:22.464 --> 47:24.090
- And News 4's Tim Hilert.
- [Phone rings]

47:24.258 --> 47:28.135
- [Mother] Well, that's your phone.
- Yeah. [laughs nervously]

47:28.303 --> 47:32.390
Seriously, congratulations.
This'll be a pleasure to sign.

47:32.558 --> 47:35.268
[Phone rings]

47:38.939 --> 47:40.648
- Hello?
- [Jennifer] David?

47:40.816 --> 47:42.525
Are you watching the news?

47:42.693 --> 47:45.236
Jennifer. Yeah, I'm watching.

47:45.404 --> 47:48.155
Is that us on TV?
Did we do that?

47:48.323 --> 47:52.451
It could be. Oh, Jesus, Jennifer!
What am I gonna do?

47:52.619 --> 47:54.954
They're gonna come get me.
I'm screwed!

47:55.122 --> 47:56.372
I am screwed!

47:56.540 --> 48:01.043
Wait, no! Sh!
Calm down, calm down.

48:01.211 --> 48:03.963
If they were so smart,
they would've found you already.

48:04.131 --> 48:05.214
Yeah.

48:05.382 --> 48:09.760
All you have to do is throw the number
away and don't call it again.

48:09.928 --> 48:11.971
That's all.

48:12.139 --> 48:14.098
Maybe they didn't trace the call.

48:14.266 --> 48:16.225
Right. Maybe they didn't.

48:16.393 --> 48:20.813
I'm sure they didn't trace it.
All you have to do is act normal.

48:20.981 --> 48:23.316
We'll both act normal
and it'll be fine.

48:23.483 --> 48:25.818
- OK?
- OK.

48:25.986 --> 48:27.320
OK.

48:27.863 --> 48:29.739
God, this is so unbelievable.

48:29.907 --> 48:32.325
Do you think maybe
I can tell Michelle?

48:32.492 --> 48:34.035
No, Jennifer, don't call her!

48:34.745 --> 48:37.914
I'm sorry. I won't.
I'll talk to you tomorrow, OK?

48:38.081 --> 48:39.498
OK.

48:39.666 --> 48:40.833
Good night, Jennifer.

49:04.858 --> 49:06.192
[Phone ringing]

49:07.152 --> 49:09.487
[Computer tone beeping]

49:11.698 --> 49:13.908
[Computer] Greetings, Professor Falken.

49:15.285 --> 49:16.577
Oh, my God.

49:24.544 --> 49:28.464
"Incorrect identification.

49:28.632 --> 49:30.758
I am not Falken.

49:30.926 --> 49:34.053
Falken is dead."

49:35.806 --> 49:38.224
Sorry to hear that, professor.

49:38.392 --> 49:41.018
Yesterday's game was interrupted.

49:42.729 --> 49:45.356
Although primary goal
has not yet been achieved,

49:45.524 --> 49:47.024
solution is near.

49:47.192 --> 49:52.613
Game time elapsed:
31 hours, 12 minutes, 50 seconds.

49:52.781 --> 49:54.782
Estimated time remaining:

49:54.950 --> 49:59.787
52 hours, 17 minutes, 10 seconds.

49:59.955 --> 50:04.250
"What is the primary goal?"

50:05.293 --> 50:09.005
You should know, professor.
You programmed me.

50:09.172 --> 50:10.589
Oh, come on.

50:11.800 --> 50:15.344
"What is the primary goal?"

50:17.431 --> 50:19.432
To win the game.

50:27.232 --> 50:28.607
[Phone ringing]

50:28.775 --> 50:30.401
[Computer tone]

50:34.406 --> 50:35.948
[Hangs up]

50:36.116 --> 50:37.116
[Phone rings]

50:48.253 --> 50:50.755
[Beeping]

50:58.138 --> 51:00.639
[Ship horn blares]

51:04.144 --> 51:06.812
[Train whistle blows]

51:48.814 --> 51:51.524
David Lightman,
hold it right there. FBI.

51:51.691 --> 51:53.776
- I'll read you your rights.
- Step over here.

51:53.944 --> 51:55.569
"You have the right to remain silent.

51:55.737 --> 51:59.156
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

51:59.324 --> 52:03.869
You may consult with an attorney and
have one present during questioning.

52:04.037 --> 52:06.539
If you can't afford one,
one will be appointed to you."

52:06.706 --> 52:07.665
Left hand, please.

52:07.833 --> 52:10.209
Do you understand these rights?

52:10.377 --> 52:13.587
With this in mind, are you willing
to talk about the charges against you?

52:15.257 --> 52:16.340
Let's move.

52:29.563 --> 52:33.649
This large room is the command center
for NORAD. No picture taking.

52:33.817 --> 52:35.693
These screens are connected

52:35.861 --> 52:39.780
to our satellites and missile
tracking stations in the country.

52:39.948 --> 52:42.616
This is the commander's desk.
Col. Conley's in charge.

52:42.784 --> 52:45.744
Colonel, would you mind
relinquishing your command, sir?

52:45.912 --> 52:48.789
Miss Dailey, would you sit
in this rather important chair?

52:50.083 --> 52:53.043
These switches are connected
to the Strategic Air Command

52:53.211 --> 52:56.630
missile launching stations
and other classified things.

52:56.798 --> 52:59.592
Would you press this button
right here? The red one.

52:59.759 --> 53:01.302
- The one in the middle?
- Yes.

53:01.469 --> 53:03.929
- Oh, my God! That's the wrong one!
- [Alarm blares]

53:04.097 --> 53:06.849
[Laughs] It's a joke! You didn't blow up
anything, but look what you did.

53:07.017 --> 53:07.975
- [Laughs]
- [Music plays on computer]

53:08.143 --> 53:10.603
"Distinguished visitors
from Birmingham."

53:40.550 --> 53:43.510
Last week I had the governor
of New Jersey in this chair.

53:43.678 --> 53:47.806
He asked me, "Colonel, why are we
at DEFCON 4 as we are right now?"

53:47.974 --> 53:49.391
Why are we at DEFCON 4?

53:49.559 --> 53:52.311
The Soviets saw our bombers scramble
and went on alert.

53:52.479 --> 53:54.521
We told them
it was just an exercise.

53:54.689 --> 53:57.483
We're waiting for them
to relax their posture before we do.

53:58.193 --> 53:59.526
Wait, wait.

54:00.153 --> 54:02.071
- Give me that.
- Another tour group.

54:02.239 --> 54:04.114
Just what we need today.

54:04.282 --> 54:08.035
- Why don't they go to Disneyland?
- I think they're going tomorrow.

54:08.203 --> 54:09.328
OK, all set?

54:09.496 --> 54:10.746
Oh, here.

54:13.833 --> 54:15.834
[Paul] It was a one-in-a-million shot.

54:16.002 --> 54:19.171
There was an open line
at our division in Sunnyvale.

54:19.339 --> 54:21.757
The phone company screwed up!

54:21.925 --> 54:24.343
- John McKittrick, George Wigan.
- How are you?

54:24.511 --> 54:26.720
George is with the FBI.
He brought the kid in.

54:26.888 --> 54:30.224
It looks like we've got
a high school prank on our hands.

54:30.392 --> 54:31.642
Paul, what happened?

54:31.810 --> 54:34.144
The kid broke into
the war games subsystem

54:34.312 --> 54:37.189
using a password left
by the original programmer.

54:37.357 --> 54:38.649
- Password?
- Yes, sir.

54:38.817 --> 54:40.693
None of my team knew it was there.

54:40.860 --> 54:43.529
Kid claims he was looking
for a toy company.

54:43.697 --> 54:47.074
That's great.
Anybody in here buy that one?

54:47.867 --> 54:49.827
We can take out the password,

54:49.995 --> 54:52.705
but it'd help to beef up
security around the WOPR.

54:52.872 --> 54:54.623
Beef up, huh?

54:55.375 --> 54:56.500
How about screwed up?

54:57.210 --> 54:59.503
We did all that
and he broke in again.

54:59.671 --> 55:02.047
[George] Kid says
your computer called him.

55:02.215 --> 55:04.800
What the hell is going on, John?

55:04.968 --> 55:08.971
I woke up the president. I told him
we were under attack by the Russians.

55:09.139 --> 55:13.309
Do you know what kind of idiot that
makes me look like? Or the general?

55:13.476 --> 55:15.602
Wait, general.
We're being naive.

55:15.770 --> 55:19.273
There's no way a high school punk
can put a dime in a telephone

55:19.441 --> 55:20.899
and break into our system.

55:21.067 --> 55:23.235
He's got to be working
with somebody else.

55:23.403 --> 55:24.987
He fits the profile perfectly.

55:25.155 --> 55:27.323
He's intelligent,
but an underachiever,

55:27.490 --> 55:31.076
alienated from his parents,
has few friends.

55:31.244 --> 55:32.870
Classic case for Soviet recruitment.

55:33.079 --> 55:35.664
What does this say
about the state of our country?

55:35.832 --> 55:37.750
Have you gotten any insight

55:37.917 --> 55:43.088
as to why a bright boy like this
would jeopardize the lives of millions?

55:43.256 --> 55:45.299
Says he does this sort
of thing for fun.

55:45.717 --> 55:48.886
Damn it, John, I want some answers
and I want them now!

55:49.054 --> 55:50.888
Arthur.

55:52.724 --> 55:55.893
- Let me talk to this prick.
- No more talk. Just do it!

55:58.480 --> 55:59.646
I'll talk to the kid.

56:03.443 --> 56:05.235
[Man] Who do they belong to,
do you know?

56:05.403 --> 56:06.904
No idea.

56:07.530 --> 56:09.198
- Good morning, sir.
- Where's the kid?

56:09.366 --> 56:11.075
In the infirmary, sir.

56:13.161 --> 56:14.161
[Keypad beeping]

56:20.377 --> 56:24.421
Hello, David. John McKittrick.
I run the computer facility here.

56:25.382 --> 56:28.509
- These aren't necessary, the handcuffs?
- No, sir.

56:30.220 --> 56:31.678
David, uh...

56:32.472 --> 56:36.058
We called your parents
and we told them everything's fine.

56:36.226 --> 56:38.977
No charges have been filed.
[Sniffs] Yet.

56:39.145 --> 56:43.857
But I think we are gonna need
a little time to sort things out here.

56:44.734 --> 56:45.818
How much time?

56:46.653 --> 56:49.238
That depends on how willing
you are to cooperate.

56:49.406 --> 56:51.532
Oh. Of course.

56:53.034 --> 56:54.159
I tell you what.

56:54.327 --> 56:56.995
Sergeant, tell the O.D.
I'm taking David for a walk.

56:57.163 --> 56:59.998
Let's go to my office.
We'll be more comfortable.

57:01.126 --> 57:02.334
Go ahead.

57:07.632 --> 57:09.633
[David] You worked with Stephen Falken,
didn't you?

57:09.801 --> 57:12.344
[John] I started out as his assistant.
How'd you know?

57:12.512 --> 57:15.347
[David] I read an article you co-wrote
on poker and nuclear war.

57:15.515 --> 57:18.142
[John] Bluffing.
Yeah, that shook a few people up.

57:18.309 --> 57:20.144
[David] He must have
been pretty amazing.

57:20.311 --> 57:22.354
He's a brilliant man.
A little flaky.

57:22.522 --> 57:27.067
He never understood
the practical uses of his work.

57:27.235 --> 57:30.821
This machine over here
runs his game program.

57:30.989 --> 57:32.364
Joshua.

57:34.659 --> 57:35.701
[John] Come here a minute.

57:37.996 --> 57:40.414
- See that sign up here? Up here?
- Yeah.

57:40.582 --> 57:42.124
DEFCON?

57:42.292 --> 57:45.085
That indicates
our current defense condition.

57:45.253 --> 57:48.714
It should read DEFCON 5,
which means peace.

57:48.882 --> 57:51.842
It's still on 4 because of
that little stunt you pulled.

57:52.010 --> 57:56.013
Actually, if we hadn't caught it in
time it might have gone to DEFCON 1.

57:57.223 --> 57:59.725
- Do you know what that means?
- No, what?

58:00.310 --> 58:01.435
World War III.

58:03.062 --> 58:03.729
Wow.

58:03.897 --> 58:06.857
You say you broke into our system
just to play a game?

58:07.025 --> 58:09.318
That's right. That's exactly right.

58:09.486 --> 58:12.696
Mm-hm. [laughs]

58:13.615 --> 58:16.241
When you saw it on the news,
you knew how serious it was.

58:16.409 --> 58:17.701
Why'd you do it again?

58:17.869 --> 58:20.370
I didn't.
I even threw the number away.

58:20.538 --> 58:22.164
Yeah, they found it in the trash.

58:22.332 --> 58:24.082
Joshua called me.

58:24.918 --> 58:29.588
- Hey! Look at that. That's some setup.
- What'd you say?

58:29.756 --> 58:31.673
This is some setup.

58:31.841 --> 58:33.467
No, no, before that.

58:33.635 --> 58:35.260
Joshua called me.

58:35.929 --> 58:37.095
[Scoffs]

58:37.263 --> 58:39.431
Machines don't call people.

58:40.892 --> 58:42.142
Yours did.

58:46.314 --> 58:48.690
Who are you going to Paris with?

58:50.818 --> 58:53.529
Pari... Oh!
No, no, you don't understand.

58:53.696 --> 58:56.406
Now, you had reservations
for two to Paris.

58:59.452 --> 59:01.912
- Who are you working with?
- Nobody!

59:04.958 --> 59:05.999
Why don't I believe you?

59:10.046 --> 59:12.714
I shouldn't say any more
until I talk to a lawyer.

59:14.509 --> 59:16.802
I think we better forget
about a lawyer

59:16.970 --> 59:19.429
until I get a few answers
out of you myself.

59:21.307 --> 59:23.725
[Phone rings]

59:28.648 --> 59:31.191
[Continues ringing]

59:39.075 --> 59:40.659
You gonna answer the phone?

59:44.831 --> 59:48.500
Hello. Yeah. What?

59:50.253 --> 59:51.295
All right, I'll be right down.

59:52.380 --> 59:54.339
You stay here. Don't move.

01:00:06.603 --> 01:00:07.644
What's going on?

01:00:07.812 --> 01:00:11.315
There's been a serious penetration
into our WOPR execution order file.

01:00:11.482 --> 01:00:13.859
- What's he saying?
- Let's have it in English.

01:00:14.027 --> 01:00:18.363
I'll give it to you in English.
Somebody got into McKittrick's system

01:00:18.531 --> 01:00:20.282
and stole our missile codes.

01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:21.408
Is that right?

01:00:21.576 --> 01:00:25.787
The system won't accept a launch code
unless we're at DEFCON 1.

01:00:25.955 --> 01:00:28.165
I can change those codes in an hour.

01:00:28.625 --> 01:00:29.708
Who did this?

01:00:30.168 --> 01:00:32.669
The kid's gotta be working
with somebody.

01:00:32.837 --> 01:00:37.382
I sure as hell don't want our bombers
on the ground if anything happens.

01:00:38.217 --> 01:00:41.637
Take us to DEFCON 3 and get SAC
on the line. Where are you?

01:00:41.804 --> 01:00:43.388
Sir.

01:00:43.556 --> 01:00:46.725
Get me an update. I wanna know
what those bastards are up to.

01:00:46.893 --> 01:00:47.851
Yes, sir.

01:00:48.019 --> 01:00:49.895
[Buzzer sounds]

01:00:53.650 --> 01:00:55.692
[Computer beeping]

01:01:15.213 --> 01:01:16.505
Joshua.

01:01:18.716 --> 01:01:21.009
[Joshua] Greetings, Professor Falken.

01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:27.808
Hello. Are you still
playing the game?

01:01:29.727 --> 01:01:30.686
Of course.

01:01:30.853 --> 01:01:32.771
I should reach DEFCON 1

01:01:32.939 --> 01:01:36.441
and launch my missiles in 28 hours.

01:01:36.609 --> 01:01:41.405
Would you like to see
some projected kill ratios?

01:01:41.572 --> 01:01:44.574
[David] Sixty-nine percent
of the housing destroyed.

01:01:44.742 --> 01:01:47.244
Seventy-two million people dead?

01:01:51.124 --> 01:01:54.042
Is this a game...

01:01:54.669 --> 01:01:56.336
...or is it real?

01:01:57.046 --> 01:01:59.673
- What's the difference?
- Oh, wow.

01:02:01.467 --> 01:02:03.969
You are a hard man to reach.

01:02:04.137 --> 01:02:06.471
Could not find you in Seattle

01:02:06.639 --> 01:02:10.976
and no terminal is in operation
at your classified address.

01:02:16.691 --> 01:02:20.235
What classified address?

01:02:22.155 --> 01:02:26.408
DOD pension files
indicate current mailing ad...

01:02:28.995 --> 01:02:30.829
...Dr. Robert Hume,

01:02:30.997 --> 01:02:34.082
a.k.a. Stephen W. Falken.

01:02:36.169 --> 01:02:40.839
5 Tall Cedar Road,
Goose Island, Oregon, 97...

01:02:41.007 --> 01:02:43.842
Can I just talk to Mr. McKittrick?
I know what's... Ah!

01:02:44.010 --> 01:02:45.177
Can I talk to McKittrick?

01:02:45.344 --> 01:02:48.180
I'll be escorting you
to federal authorities in Denver

01:02:48.347 --> 01:02:51.516
where you'll be under arrest
pending indictment for espionage.

01:02:51.684 --> 01:02:54.603
No, wait a minute.
He's right over there.

01:02:55.521 --> 01:02:57.439
Get that bastard out of the war room!

01:02:57.607 --> 01:02:59.316
No! It's Joshua!

01:02:59.484 --> 01:03:02.235
He's still playing the game!
He's gonna start a war!

01:03:02.403 --> 01:03:05.363
Hold him where you had him before.
We'll be leaving soon.

01:03:05.531 --> 01:03:08.033
[David] Call Falken! He'll tell you.
Please call him.

01:03:08.201 --> 01:03:09.951
Please call him! Call him!

01:03:10.286 --> 01:03:12.412
What the hell's he doing
in here anyway?

01:03:29.972 --> 01:03:32.599
Some of the men say
you're quite a tennis player.

01:03:32.767 --> 01:03:35.101
[Woman laughing]

01:04:43.379 --> 01:04:47.299
[Recorder] Patient's eyes are dilated,
consistent with use of marijuana

01:04:47.466 --> 01:04:49.718
and possibly PCP.

01:05:18.581 --> 01:05:21.791
Depending on what information you want,
you press a button.

01:05:21.959 --> 01:05:26.171
Well, let's say I wanted
to find out how to hit a backhand.

01:05:26.339 --> 01:05:28.840
[Laughs] I don't think
I have the right program.

01:05:29.008 --> 01:05:31.259
- [Knocking on door]
- Excuse me. What do you want?

01:05:31.427 --> 01:05:33.929
[David] Bathroom.
It's a long ride to Denver.

01:05:38.476 --> 01:05:40.393
[Keypad beeping]

01:05:40.895 --> 01:05:43.396
Please, let me talk to Mr. McKittrick.

01:05:43.564 --> 01:05:46.149
You're not talking to anybody.
The FBI's coming soon.

01:05:46.317 --> 01:05:49.027
- Do you have to take a leak?
- No.

01:05:59.246 --> 01:06:01.539
[Soft buzzing]

01:06:07.338 --> 01:06:09.339
[Recording of keypad plays]

01:06:09.507 --> 01:06:10.840
[Door unlocks]

01:06:16.472 --> 01:06:18.723
- [Woman] I'm working here.
- [Man] Oh, I'm sorry.

01:06:19.266 --> 01:06:20.976
Stop it!

01:06:21.143 --> 01:06:23.853
- You have pretty eyes.
- That's original.

01:06:28.734 --> 01:06:30.527
- I'll get the elevator.
- Sign in?

01:06:30.695 --> 01:06:33.446
- Yeah, get us all.
- [Elevator dings]

01:06:46.252 --> 01:06:48.670
- [Electrical fizzling]
- [Unlocks]

01:06:55.094 --> 01:06:58.638
[Man] I heard they voted you
Miss Fine in 1979. Is that true?

01:07:00.599 --> 01:07:01.808
[Woman] Will you stop it?

01:07:01.976 --> 01:07:03.768
- [Man] Am I bothering you?
- [Woman] Yes.

01:07:03.936 --> 01:07:06.479
- [Man] Do you want me to leave?
- [Woman] Yes.

01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:26.416
[Elevator dings]

01:07:58.574 --> 01:08:04.370
[Keypad beeping]

01:08:19.428 --> 01:08:20.761
I want this door open now.

01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:23.640
- How about calling?
- Yes, sir.

01:08:23.808 --> 01:08:24.682
I don't believe this.

01:08:59.176 --> 01:09:01.219
[Man] Hey, Scooter. Wait up.

01:09:02.555 --> 01:09:04.514
[Man 2] Come on, hurry it up. I'm late.

01:09:04.682 --> 01:09:06.140
[Man] OK, I'll be right with you.

01:09:07.725 --> 01:09:10.310
I think it's jammed from inside.

01:09:10.479 --> 01:09:12.272
David!

01:09:12.439 --> 01:09:14.899
You're just making it
harder on yourself.

01:09:19.904 --> 01:09:21.406
[Man] Let's go.

01:09:30.416 --> 01:09:31.875
[Man] Right this way, folks.

01:09:32.376 --> 01:09:36.171
I was just told that they're cleaning
the floors in the computer center.

01:09:36.337 --> 01:09:40.216
Don't want anyone to slip and fall,
so we'll end the tour here.

01:09:40.759 --> 01:09:43.803
Now, if I can ask you to board
the bus as quickly as possible...

01:09:44.388 --> 01:09:48.558
...you'll have a complimentary beverage
waiting at the officer's center.

01:09:48.725 --> 01:09:50.268
- Hold it! What are you doing?
- Ah!

01:09:50.435 --> 01:09:52.687
Got it. Here it comes.

01:09:54.148 --> 01:09:55.398
Do you kids think
you own this place?

01:09:55.566 --> 01:09:58.943
[Stammers] Oh.
I was just looking around.

01:10:00.070 --> 01:10:01.362
You're not supposed
to leave the group.

01:10:01.530 --> 01:10:02.155
Yes.

01:10:02.323 --> 01:10:05.992
- So why don't you get back there?
- Thank you very much, sir.

01:10:07.244 --> 01:10:08.286
Get out of the way.

01:10:13.834 --> 01:10:15.043
Take care. Watch your step.

01:10:15.211 --> 01:10:17.503
- Bye.
- Bye, now.

01:10:17.671 --> 01:10:18.838
Watch your step. Thank you.

01:10:19.006 --> 01:10:21.591
Check everywhere.
He can't be far. Let's move.

01:10:33.229 --> 01:10:35.605

01:11:17.731 --> 01:11:19.524

- [Man] Take care.

01:12:56.538 --> 01:12:57.872
[Operator] What city, please?

01:12:58.040 --> 01:12:59.499
Goose Island, Oregon.

01:12:59.666 --> 01:13:02.460
The number for
Dr. Robert Hume, H-U-M-E,

01:13:02.628 --> 01:13:04.796
on Tall Cedar Road.

01:13:07.216 --> 01:13:10.802
Checking under Dr. Robert Hume,
H-U-M-E, on Tall Cedar Road.

01:13:10.969 --> 01:13:12.637
I find no listing.

01:13:12.805 --> 01:13:15.056
What does that mean?
He doesn't have a phone?

01:13:15.224 --> 01:13:17.642
I'm sorry. I have no listing.

01:13:17.810 --> 01:13:19.644
Oh, wait. Uh...

01:13:19.812 --> 01:13:23.898
Falken. Dr. Stephen Falken,
F-A-L-K-E-N,

01:13:24.066 --> 01:13:25.525
at the same address.

01:13:26.235 --> 01:13:29.570
I find no listing for
Dr. Stephen Falken, F-A-L-K-E-N,

01:13:29.738 --> 01:13:32.490
on Tall Cedar Road, Goose Island.

01:13:32.658 --> 01:13:33.658
Thank you.

01:13:40.165 --> 01:13:42.583
[Phone rings]

01:13:50.843 --> 01:13:51.843
Yeah?

01:13:52.511 --> 01:13:53.594
Jennifer, it's me, David.

01:13:53.762 --> 01:13:56.347
- David?!
- Yeah, uh...

01:13:56.515 --> 01:13:57.974
Listen, I'm in Colorado

01:13:58.142 --> 01:14:00.351
and I need a really big favor.

01:14:00.519 --> 01:14:02.895
- Can you lend me some money?
- What?

01:14:03.063 --> 01:14:05.898
I need an airline ticket.
I'll pay you back.

01:14:06.066 --> 01:14:09.068
I need a ticket from Grand Junction
to Salem, Oregon.

01:14:09.236 --> 01:14:10.611
Why? What's going on?

01:14:10.779 --> 01:14:12.363
I'll tell you about it later.

01:14:12.531 --> 01:14:14.657
What are you doing in Colorado?

01:14:14.825 --> 01:14:17.869
I went by your house.
Your parents were freaked

01:14:18.036 --> 01:14:21.080
and there are men from the FBI
asking all these questions.

01:14:21.248 --> 01:14:23.708
I can't talk about it right now.
Listen...

01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:25.960
...when you buy the ticket,
tell them

01:14:26.128 --> 01:14:28.963
I'll pick it up
in Grand Junction Airport?

01:14:29.131 --> 01:14:31.048
David, what's happening?

01:14:31.216 --> 01:14:33.217
I can't talk.
I gotta get off the phone.

01:14:33.385 --> 01:14:35.636
But please, will you do this for me?

01:14:40.309 --> 01:14:42.852
Punch up number five.
Let me see what you have.

01:14:44.062 --> 01:14:47.398
Twenty-two typhoon-class submarines
departing Petropavlovsk,

01:14:47.566 --> 01:14:51.319
turning southbound at Nordkapp,
bearing 095 degrees.

01:14:51.487 --> 01:14:53.946
Sergeant, I hope you like vodka.

01:14:54.114 --> 01:14:58.659
Yes, sir. I just hope they don't make
me eat none of them damn fish eggs.

01:15:05.250 --> 01:15:09.128
Sir, the Soviets are denying any
increase in their submarine deployment.

01:15:09.296 --> 01:15:11.255
They want to know
why we're provoking them.

01:15:11.423 --> 01:15:14.759
They're full of shit.
We know they're down there.

01:15:14.927 --> 01:15:17.345
I'm gonna blow their ass
out of the water.

01:15:21.475 --> 01:15:24.477
[Computer humming]

Surprise!

01:16:01.765 --> 01:16:02.807
Why are you here?

01:16:02.975 --> 01:16:05.685
You didn't sound too good.
It's only a three-hour drive.

01:16:05.852 --> 01:16:07.478
You shouldn't have come.
I'm in trouble.

01:16:07.646 --> 01:16:08.646
Why?

01:16:09.940 --> 01:16:12.441
Is this because of
what you did with my grade?

01:16:12.609 --> 01:16:16.279
[Ship horn blares]

01:16:20.075 --> 01:16:22.618
[Man] Better hustle. The ferry's
gonna leave any second.

01:16:22.786 --> 01:16:24.704
Thanks. Come on, we gotta run.

01:16:29.793 --> 01:16:31.335
Wait, wait, wait!

01:16:31.503 --> 01:16:32.837
Hold it, hold it.

01:16:35.924 --> 01:16:38.926
[Ship horn blares]

01:16:41.930 --> 01:16:45.057
If he's alive, why'd
the obituary say he's dead?

01:16:45.225 --> 01:16:47.310
He's not dead. He left.

01:16:48.770 --> 01:16:51.272
When they know too much,
they get new identities.

01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:54.442
- Anyway, the computer said so.
- Oh, the computer said so.

01:16:54.610 --> 01:16:57.820
Is that the computer
that's still playing the games?

01:16:57.988 --> 01:17:00.781
It's the military's computer.
Why wouldn't they know?

01:17:00.949 --> 01:17:04.410
They don't know about Joshua.
Falken knows about Joshua.

01:17:04.578 --> 01:17:06.996
He's the only one
who knows what it can do.

01:17:07.164 --> 01:17:10.416
The computer is trying to win
the game we asked it to play.

01:17:10.584 --> 01:17:12.209
For real!

01:17:13.837 --> 01:17:16.005
You don't even believe me!

He's not dead.

01:17:25.349 --> 01:17:26.432
I'm sorry.

01:17:29.728 --> 01:17:31.103
I believe you.

01:17:41.239 --> 01:17:43.949

01:18:19.736 --> 01:18:21.237
Oh, shit!

01:18:21.405 --> 01:18:22.405
What was that?

01:18:23.031 --> 01:18:24.198
[Jennifer] I don't know.

01:18:29.121 --> 01:18:31.455
Did you see that?

01:18:31.623 --> 01:18:33.833
Some people won't believe
they could fly.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:35.793
The sky was once filled with them!

01:18:35.961 --> 01:18:37.461
I'm looking for Dr. Hume.

01:18:37.629 --> 01:18:40.423
Are you a paleontologist?
I need a paleontologist.

01:18:40.590 --> 01:18:41.882
No, we're high school students.

01:18:42.050 --> 01:18:44.677
Oh... pity.

01:18:44.845 --> 01:18:49.932
Well, high school students, you're on
my land and I didn't invite you.

01:18:50.100 --> 01:18:53.519
But aren't you Stephen Falken?

01:18:54.771 --> 01:18:57.314
Now, listen carefully.

01:18:57.482 --> 01:18:58.524
Path.

01:18:58.692 --> 01:18:59.817
Follow path.

01:19:00.402 --> 01:19:03.487
Gate. Open gate,
through gate, close gate.

01:19:03.655 --> 01:19:05.823
Last ferry, 6:30,
so run, run, run.

01:19:06.491 --> 01:19:10.494
Wait! Wait!
I came because of Joshua.

01:19:19.963 --> 01:19:22.590
[Computer humming]

01:19:38.190 --> 01:19:41.150
[Beeping rapidly]

01:19:52.370 --> 01:19:53.454
Radar reports two unknown tracks

01:19:53.622 --> 01:19:56.707
are penetrating
the Alaskan air defense zone.

01:19:58.919 --> 01:20:02.546
Flight profile suggests
Soviet backfire bombers.

01:20:02.714 --> 01:20:07.218
I want a visual confirmation on that.
Scramble two F-16s out of Galena.

01:20:09.679 --> 01:20:10.721
Go to DEFCON 2.

01:20:10.889 --> 01:20:12.932
[Buzzer sounds]

01:20:13.099 --> 01:20:17.061
[Alarm blares]

01:20:43.588 --> 01:20:46.215
[Man over radio] Crystal Palace,
this is Delta Foxtrot 27.

01:20:46.383 --> 01:20:50.803
I have negative radar contact.
Repeat, negative Soviet aircraft.

01:20:50.971 --> 01:20:54.306
27, this is Brass Hat.
They're right in front of you!

01:20:54.474 --> 01:20:56.183
You're almost on top of them.

01:20:56.935 --> 01:20:58.811
[Man over radio] Brass Hat,
we got nothing on radar

01:20:58.979 --> 01:21:00.980
and 40 miles visibility.

01:21:01.147 --> 01:21:03.899
There's nothing out there, general.
Just blue skies.

01:21:05.151 --> 01:21:07.069
What the hell?

01:21:12.742 --> 01:21:14.827
[Beeping]

01:21:17.205 --> 01:21:18.873
[Jennifer] You really
haven't been listening.

01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:23.085
[Falken] Yes, I have. I loved it
when you nuked Las Vegas.

01:21:23.253 --> 01:21:26.630
Suitably biblical ending
for the place, don't you think?

01:21:26.798 --> 01:21:29.466
You gonna tell them
what Joshua's doing?

01:21:31.136 --> 01:21:32.595
Children, come over here.

01:21:32.762 --> 01:21:35.598
I'm gonna tell you a bedtime story.

01:21:35.765 --> 01:21:38.058
Are you sitting comfortably?

01:21:38.226 --> 01:21:40.185
Then I'll begin.

01:21:40.353 --> 01:21:42.146
Once upon a time...

01:21:43.315 --> 01:21:46.317
...there lived
a magnificent race of animals...

01:21:47.027 --> 01:21:49.570
...who dominated the world
through age after age.

01:21:49.738 --> 01:21:53.949
They ran and they swam
and they fought and they flew,

01:21:54.117 --> 01:21:55.409
until suddenly...

01:21:55.577 --> 01:21:57.161
...quite recently...

01:21:57.329 --> 01:21:58.704
...they disappeared.

01:21:58.872 --> 01:22:00.956
Nature just gave up

01:22:01.124 --> 01:22:03.000
and started again.

01:22:03.668 --> 01:22:05.169
We weren't even apes then.

01:22:05.337 --> 01:22:09.340
We were just these smart
little rodents hiding in the rocks.

01:22:09.507 --> 01:22:11.091
And when we go...

01:22:12.093 --> 01:22:14.261
...nature will start again...

01:22:14.429 --> 01:22:16.305
...with the bees probably.

01:22:17.974 --> 01:22:19.934
Nature knows when to give up.

01:22:20.101 --> 01:22:21.894
I'm not giving up.

01:22:23.188 --> 01:22:26.190
If Joshua tricks them into launching
an attack, it'll be your fault.

01:22:27.067 --> 01:22:28.233
My fault?

01:22:28.401 --> 01:22:31.695
The whole point was
to practice nuclear war

01:22:31.863 --> 01:22:33.238
without destroying ourselves.

01:22:33.406 --> 01:22:37.201
To get the computers to learn
from mistakes we couldn't make.

01:22:37.369 --> 01:22:41.705
Except that I never could get Joshua
to learn the most important lesson.

01:22:41.873 --> 01:22:43.457
What's that?

01:22:43.625 --> 01:22:47.211
Futility. That there's a time
when you should just give up.

01:22:47.379 --> 01:22:49.088
What kind of lesson is that?

01:22:49.255 --> 01:22:51.382
Did you ever play tic-tac-toe?

01:22:53.051 --> 01:22:54.385
Yeah. Of course.

01:22:54.552 --> 01:22:56.512
- But you don't anymore.
- No.

01:22:56.680 --> 01:22:57.930
Why?

01:22:58.890 --> 01:23:01.725
Because it's a boring game.
It's always a tie.

01:23:01.893 --> 01:23:06.438
Exactly. There's no way to win.
The game itself is pointless.

01:23:07.607 --> 01:23:11.819
But back at the war room, they believe
you can win a nuclear war...

01:23:12.487 --> 01:23:15.072
...that there can be
acceptable losses.

01:23:16.241 --> 01:23:17.533
So you gave up?

01:23:18.284 --> 01:23:19.827
Decided to play dead?

01:23:20.829 --> 01:23:24.581
For security reasons,
they graciously arranged my death.

01:23:26.001 --> 01:23:28.419
Did you know that no land animal

01:23:28.586 --> 01:23:31.880
with a body weight of
over 50 pounds survived that age?

01:23:33.133 --> 01:23:36.093
Extinction is part
of the natural order.

01:23:36.261 --> 01:23:37.511
Bullshit!

01:23:39.055 --> 01:23:42.224
If we're extinguished,
it's not natural. It's stupid.

01:23:42.392 --> 01:23:45.227
It's all right. I've planned ahead.

01:23:45.395 --> 01:23:49.189
We're just three miles
from a primary target.

01:23:49.357 --> 01:23:51.608
A millisecond of brilliant light...

01:23:51.776 --> 01:23:53.569
...and we're vaporized.

01:23:54.279 --> 01:23:56.113
Much more fortunate than the millions

01:23:56.281 --> 01:23:59.825
who'll wander sightless
through the smoldering aftermath.

01:24:01.661 --> 01:24:04.455
We'll be spared
the horror of survival.

01:24:05.123 --> 01:24:07.958
I'm only 17 years old.

01:24:08.710 --> 01:24:10.502
I'm not ready to die yet.

01:24:10.670 --> 01:24:12.963
You won't make a simple phone call?

01:24:15.050 --> 01:24:18.469
If the real Joshua were still alive,
your Joshua...

01:24:18.636 --> 01:24:19.803
...you'd do it.

01:24:19.971 --> 01:24:23.098
We might gain a few years,
enough for you to have a son

01:24:23.266 --> 01:24:25.017
and watch him die.

01:24:26.811 --> 01:24:30.230
But humanity planning
its own destruction...

01:24:31.608 --> 01:24:32.983
...that, a phone call won't stop.

01:24:33.818 --> 01:24:35.152
This is unreal!

01:24:35.779 --> 01:24:37.988
You don't care about death
because you're already dead!

01:24:40.408 --> 01:24:43.786
I know a lot about you.
I know you weren't always like this.

01:24:43.953 --> 01:24:45.621
What's the last thing
you cared about?

01:24:48.166 --> 01:24:50.209
[Ship horn blaring in distance]

01:24:50.376 --> 01:24:52.169
You've missed the last ferry.

01:25:00.011 --> 01:25:01.386
You're welcome to stay.

01:25:02.222 --> 01:25:04.098
You want to sleep on the floor?

01:25:08.103 --> 01:25:09.520
Good night.

01:25:12.982 --> 01:25:14.149
Let's get out of here.

01:25:24.327 --> 01:25:25.994
Come on, we'll find a boat.

01:25:26.162 --> 01:25:27.830
There's gotta be a boat.

01:25:41.636 --> 01:25:44.096
[Beeping]

01:25:45.140 --> 01:25:48.559
Mr. President, we've got 48 nuclear subs
closing on the United States,

01:25:48.726 --> 01:25:53.063
and we've got 100,000 Soviet troops
massing in East Germany.

01:25:53.231 --> 01:25:56.024
We're monitoring their bombers
that are on alert.

01:25:56.192 --> 01:25:57.985
Well, that's a load of shit!

01:25:58.153 --> 01:26:00.070
No, no, sir. Not you.

01:26:00.822 --> 01:26:04.408
Yes, sir. We'll be in touch
as soon as the information changes.

01:26:05.076 --> 01:26:08.370
There's rumors of a new Soviet bomber
with stealth capabilities.

01:26:08.538 --> 01:26:12.249
It can project a false radar image
600 miles from the real aircraft.

01:26:12.417 --> 01:26:14.793
Christ! Now they got us
chasing shadows.

01:26:14.961 --> 01:26:17.796
[Computer humming]

01:26:27.265 --> 01:26:29.141
I think I saw one.

01:26:34.189 --> 01:26:37.482
What kind of asshole lives on
an island and doesn't have a boat?

01:26:39.027 --> 01:26:41.528
Maybe we can swim.
How far do you think it is?

01:26:41.696 --> 01:26:45.199
No, it's two, three miles, at least.

01:26:45.366 --> 01:26:46.700
Maybe more.

01:26:46.868 --> 01:26:48.493
What do you say? Let's go for it.

01:26:48.661 --> 01:26:50.162
- No.
- Come on.

01:26:50.330 --> 01:26:52.414
No. I can't swim.

01:26:54.042 --> 01:26:55.042
You can't swim?

01:26:55.210 --> 01:26:57.294
I can't swim, OK, Wonder Woman?

01:26:57.921 --> 01:27:01.340
What kind of asshole grows up in
Seattle and doesn't learn to swim?

01:27:01.507 --> 01:27:03.634
I never got around to it, OK?

01:27:03.801 --> 01:27:06.678
I always thought there was
gonna be plenty of time.

01:27:06.846 --> 01:27:08.805
Sorry.

01:27:13.770 --> 01:27:16.313
I wish I didn't know
about any of this.

01:27:18.149 --> 01:27:20.442
I wish I was like everybody else
in the world.

01:27:21.277 --> 01:27:23.987
And tomorrow it would just be over.

01:27:26.449 --> 01:27:29.076
There wouldn't be any time
to be sorry...

01:27:30.453 --> 01:27:32.246
...about anything.

01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:40.504
Oh, Jesus.

01:27:42.173 --> 01:27:44.508
I really wanted to learn how to swim.

01:27:45.635 --> 01:27:47.511
I swear to God I did.

01:27:56.854 --> 01:27:59.773
Did I tell you that next week...

01:28:00.483 --> 01:28:02.025
...I was gonna be on TV?

01:28:02.193 --> 01:28:04.528
- You're kidding.
- No.

01:28:04.696 --> 01:28:08.532
Just on that aerobics show
with some girls from my dance class.

01:28:08.700 --> 01:28:09.950
A movie star.

01:28:10.118 --> 01:28:11.535
Yeah.

01:28:12.829 --> 01:28:14.454
It's kind of stupid, huh?

01:28:14.622 --> 01:28:16.915
Nobody would've been
watching me anyway.

01:28:17.083 --> 01:28:19.459
I would have.

01:28:31.889 --> 01:28:35.142
[Helicopter approaching]

01:28:38.187 --> 01:28:39.354
Oh, Jesus!

01:28:39.522 --> 01:28:41.523
The bastard turned us in!

01:29:42.794 --> 01:29:45.462
It's all right. Get in!

01:30:04.816 --> 01:30:07.984
[Beeping]

01:30:12.156 --> 01:30:15.409
[Over PA] We have a launch detection.
We have a Soviet launch detection.

01:30:15.576 --> 01:30:17.202
BMEWS confirmed a massive attack.

01:30:17.370 --> 01:30:20.997
Missile warning. No malfunction.
Confidence is high.

01:30:21.165 --> 01:30:23.959
- [Woman] Is this an exercise?
- [Man] This is not an exercise.

01:30:24.127 --> 01:30:27.838
General, DBS is tracking
300 inbound Soviet ICBMs.

01:30:34.512 --> 01:30:37.806
Tell me this is one of your simulations,
Mr. McKittrick.

01:30:37.974 --> 01:30:41.852
All right. Flush the bombers,
get the subs in launch mode.

01:30:42.687 --> 01:30:44.521
We are at DEFCON 1.

01:30:44.689 --> 01:30:47.315
- [Over PA] DEFCON 1.
- [Buzzer sounds]

01:30:49.485 --> 01:30:50.777
[Beringer] Look at this.

01:30:50.945 --> 01:30:53.113
Major Lem, get me a report on
the WOPR.

01:30:55.199 --> 01:30:58.785
Initial attack profile is
a full-scale Soviet strike.

01:30:58.953 --> 01:31:03.206
WOPR is putting our losses at 85 to 95
percent of the strategic forces.

01:31:03.374 --> 01:31:05.375
What does WOPR recommend?

01:31:06.210 --> 01:31:08.044
[John] Full-scale retaliatory strike.

01:31:09.672 --> 01:31:12.340
I need some machine to tell me that?

01:31:12.925 --> 01:31:15.135
[Man] President's going to Andrews
to Airborne Command.

01:31:15.303 --> 01:31:16.845
We have to give launch option.

01:31:17.013 --> 01:31:18.597
[Beringer] Is he in touch
with the Premier?

01:31:18.764 --> 01:31:20.348
Russians are denying everything.

01:31:20.516 --> 01:31:24.060
We have a Soviet submarine
launch detection.

01:31:24.228 --> 01:31:27.481
Let's go into a launch mode.
Close up the mountain.

01:31:27.648 --> 01:31:32.027
[Alarm blaring]

01:31:34.572 --> 01:31:38.033
[Woman] This is Crystal Palace.
We're closing up the mountain. Hurry.

01:31:38.201 --> 01:31:40.785
After the gates are closed,
nobody gets in or out.

01:31:47.960 --> 01:31:49.794
Initiate internal power.

01:31:51.255 --> 01:31:53.256
Generators on and functioning.

01:32:02.099 --> 01:32:04.142
External power disconnected.

01:32:07.730 --> 01:32:09.397
Seal off ventilation shafts.

01:32:10.274 --> 01:32:11.775
Shaft locks sealed.

01:32:16.489 --> 01:32:18.114
- The gate's closed.
- [Screaming]

01:32:18.282 --> 01:32:19.115
[David] Oh, Jesus!

01:32:26.707 --> 01:32:27.791
Let's get out!

01:32:27.959 --> 01:32:30.794
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Run for it.

01:32:30.962 --> 01:32:33.964
[Alarm blaring]

01:32:34.131 --> 01:32:36.383
Move it! The gate's gonna shut.
Come on!

01:32:37.885 --> 01:32:39.386
Come on! Come on!

01:32:50.731 --> 01:32:52.774
Hold the door! Hold the door!

01:32:56.904 --> 01:32:58.738
Hold the goddamn door!

01:33:04.287 --> 01:33:05.829
Run! Come on! Hurry!

01:33:08.124 --> 01:33:10.166
They're clear! They're clear!

01:33:29.604 --> 01:33:31.771
[Man] All units confirm weapons
targeted and ready.

01:33:31.939 --> 01:33:33.315
Awaiting launch codes.

01:33:33.482 --> 01:33:35.275
We are in a launch mode.

01:33:35.443 --> 01:33:37.944
Major Lem, lock out changes.

01:33:38.112 --> 01:33:39.821
[Lem] Roger. Lock out enabled.

01:33:50.207 --> 01:33:51.666
All right, I'll call you back.

01:33:52.627 --> 01:33:54.169
Here!

01:34:01.802 --> 01:34:04.721
I don't know what you think
you could do here.

01:34:04.889 --> 01:34:08.558
John! Good to see you.
I see the wife still picks your ties.

01:34:08.726 --> 01:34:09.976
What has this kid been telling you?

01:34:11.020 --> 01:34:12.062
How far has it gone?

01:34:12.813 --> 01:34:14.522
The president's ready to order
a counter-strike.

01:34:14.690 --> 01:34:17.192
That's what we're recommending he do.

01:34:19.695 --> 01:34:22.697
- It's a bluff. Call it off.
- It's not a bluff. It's real.

01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:25.742
Hello, General Beringer!
Stephen Falken.

01:34:26.827 --> 01:34:29.454
[Beringer] Mr. Falken, you picked
a hell of a day for a visit.

01:34:29.622 --> 01:34:34.334
General, what you see on these screens
up here is a fantasy...

01:34:34.502 --> 01:34:36.920
...a computer-enhanced hallucination.

01:34:37.088 --> 01:34:40.215
Those blips are not real missiles.
They're phantoms.

01:34:40.883 --> 01:34:44.594
Nothing indicates a simulation at all.
Everything's working perfectly.

01:34:44.762 --> 01:34:47.555
- But does it make sense?
- Does what make sense?

01:34:47.723 --> 01:34:48.556
That.

01:34:48.724 --> 01:34:52.310
Look, I don't have time for
a conversation right now!

01:34:52.478 --> 01:34:56.272
General, are you prepared to
destroy the enemy?

01:34:56.440 --> 01:34:59.317
- You bet!
- Do you think they know that?

01:34:59.485 --> 01:35:01.194
I believe we've
made that clear enough.

01:35:01.362 --> 01:35:03.238
Then don't.

01:35:04.073 --> 01:35:06.241
Tell the president to ride out
the attack.

01:35:07.034 --> 01:35:09.119
Sir? They need a decision.

01:35:09.787 --> 01:35:14.416
Do you really believe that the enemy
would attack without provocation,

01:35:14.583 --> 01:35:16.626
using so many missiles,
bombers and subs

01:35:16.794 --> 01:35:20.130
so that we'd have no choice
but to totally annihilate them?

01:35:20.297 --> 01:35:22.716
One minute and 30 seconds to impact.

01:35:23.217 --> 01:35:27.011
General, you are listening
to a machine.

01:35:27.179 --> 01:35:29.055
Do the world a favor
and don't act like one.

01:35:30.975 --> 01:35:33.601
[Beeping]

01:35:33.769 --> 01:35:37.105
[Woman over PA] One minute
and 20 seconds to impact.

01:35:48.492 --> 01:35:50.535
Yes, Mr. President.

01:35:50.703 --> 01:35:53.997
At this time, we cannot
positively confirm the inbounds.

01:35:54.457 --> 01:35:56.875
We have reason to believe
they may not exist.

01:35:57.752 --> 01:35:59.377
Yes, that's affirmative.

01:36:00.963 --> 01:36:03.298
Yes, sir. I do too.

01:36:03.466 --> 01:36:05.508
[Woman over PA] One minute to impact.

01:36:07.219 --> 01:36:08.386
Who's first, how soon?

01:36:08.554 --> 01:36:11.514
Initial impact points
in the 43rd bomb wing at Loring,

01:36:11.682 --> 01:36:14.768
319th at Grand Forks
and Alaskan Air Command at Elmendorf.

01:36:14.935 --> 01:36:16.644
[Woman over PA] 50 seconds to impact.

01:36:16.812 --> 01:36:20.356
Get me the senior controller at those
stations. I want to talk to them.

01:36:20.524 --> 01:36:22.358
All stations, this is Crystal Palace.

01:36:22.526 --> 01:36:25.361
Stand by for a message from Brass Hat.
Acknowledge.

01:36:25.529 --> 01:36:29.115
[Man] Elmendorf Air Force Base,
Operations. Lieutenant Colonel Bowers.

01:36:29.283 --> 01:36:32.494
[Man 2] 319th Bomb Wing, Operations.
Colonel Chase.

01:36:33.537 --> 01:36:35.079
[Man 3] This is Loring Air Force Base.

01:36:35.247 --> 01:36:37.540
The senior controller
isn't here right now.

01:36:37.708 --> 01:36:40.001
That's all right. Who are you?

01:36:40.169 --> 01:36:42.879
Sir, this is Airman Dougherty, sir.

01:36:44.048 --> 01:36:46.341
This is General Beringer at NORAD.

01:36:46.509 --> 01:36:48.551
Our current situation is...

01:36:49.553 --> 01:36:51.179
Men...

01:36:51.347 --> 01:36:56.100
...we are currently tracking
about 2400 inbound Soviet warheads.

01:36:56.268 --> 01:36:58.812
But at the moment,
we cannot confirm this.

01:36:58.979 --> 01:37:01.564
I repeat, we cannot confirm this.

01:37:01.732 --> 01:37:03.650
Thirty seconds to impact.

01:37:04.401 --> 01:37:08.363
[Beringer] We're right there with you
guys. We've taken all the steps we can.

01:37:09.740 --> 01:37:11.825
Stand by to launch missiles
at my command.

01:37:19.458 --> 01:37:22.126
Stay on this channel
as long as you can.

01:37:22.586 --> 01:37:24.087
We'll be standing by.

01:37:24.255 --> 01:37:26.965
[Woman over PA]
Twenty seconds to impact.

01:37:36.267 --> 01:37:37.517
Ten...

01:37:37.685 --> 01:37:38.643
...nine...

01:37:38.811 --> 01:37:40.562
...eight...

01:37:40.729 --> 01:37:41.688
...seven...

01:37:41.856 --> 01:37:43.231
...six...

01:37:43.399 --> 01:37:45.108
...five...

01:37:45.276 --> 01:37:46.276
...four...

01:37:46.443 --> 01:37:47.735
...three...

01:37:47.903 --> 01:37:49.112
...two...

01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:51.281
...one. Impact.

01:37:51.448 --> 01:37:55.493
[Low beeping]

01:38:03.794 --> 01:38:06.963
[Low rapid beeping]

01:38:08.966 --> 01:38:15.388
This is Crystal Palace.
You still on?

01:38:15.556 --> 01:38:17.098
Anyone there?

01:38:18.976 --> 01:38:21.102
[Man] That's affirmative, sir.

01:38:21.270 --> 01:38:23.187
[Man 2] Yeah! We're here!

01:38:23.355 --> 01:38:26.399
- Christ! We're here!
- Boards are showing impact.

01:38:28.193 --> 01:38:31.487
[Man 3] No, sir. No impact.
We're alive and well.

01:38:31.655 --> 01:38:34.991
All right!

01:38:35.159 --> 01:38:38.328
[All cheering]

01:38:40.331 --> 01:38:41.998
All right!

01:38:49.548 --> 01:38:51.132
Recall the bombers!

01:38:51.300 --> 01:38:54.385
Stand down the missiles!

01:39:06.732 --> 01:39:08.608
[Rapid beeping]

01:39:10.194 --> 01:39:13.863
[Beeping, buzzer sounds]

01:39:25.084 --> 01:39:27.543
Joshua, what are you doing?

01:39:30.923 --> 01:39:33.216
COC, I need Dr. McKittrick right away.

01:39:33.717 --> 01:39:34.842
This is McKittrick.

01:39:35.010 --> 01:39:38.638
We got a problem.
WOPR is not letting me log back on.

01:39:38.806 --> 01:39:40.807
I can't get in to stand down
the missiles.

01:39:40.975 --> 01:39:42.350
All right, stand by.

01:39:47.314 --> 01:39:49.482
[Buzzer sounds]

01:39:55.197 --> 01:39:56.656
Paul, this is McKittrick.

01:39:56.824 --> 01:40:01.786
- The WOPR's not letting us back in.
- I know. No one can get back on.

01:40:01.954 --> 01:40:06.457
We're trying everything. It's like
the password file has been wiped out.

01:40:06.625 --> 01:40:09.419
Don't you think I would've tried that?

01:40:13.257 --> 01:40:14.590
[David] What are those?

01:40:15.384 --> 01:40:16.843
Those are launch codes.

01:40:17.011 --> 01:40:18.553
What are they for?

01:40:19.179 --> 01:40:22.765
Joshua's finding the right code
so he can launch the missiles himself.

01:40:33.694 --> 01:40:34.986
[John] What's happening?

01:40:35.154 --> 01:40:37.530
The random number generators
aren't even running.

01:40:37.698 --> 01:40:39.532
- Got anything?
- I'm still looking.

01:40:39.700 --> 01:40:42.326
I got no idea.
It could be coming from anywhere.

01:40:42.494 --> 01:40:44.120
[Laughing]

01:40:44.288 --> 01:40:46.164
Sir, you better get on the headset.

01:40:48.709 --> 01:40:49.792
Yeah?

01:40:49.960 --> 01:40:54.464
The machine's locked us out. It's
sending random numbers to the silos.

01:40:54.631 --> 01:40:57.008
It's trying to hit the codes
to launch the missiles.

01:40:57.176 --> 01:40:59.177
Just unplug the goddamn thing.

01:40:59.344 --> 01:41:02.305
- Jesus Christ!
- That won't work, general.

01:41:03.098 --> 01:41:06.434
It would interpret a shutdown
as the destruction of NORAD.

01:41:06.602 --> 01:41:10.146
Computers in the silos would carry out
their last instructions. They'd launch.

01:41:11.148 --> 01:41:12.607
Can't we disarm the missiles?

01:41:12.775 --> 01:41:15.526
Over a thousand of them?
There's no time.

01:41:15.694 --> 01:41:19.697
At this rate, it'll hit
the launch codes in 5.3 minutes.

01:41:21.325 --> 01:41:22.408
Mr. McKittrick?

01:41:23.285 --> 01:41:26.370
After very careful consideration,
I've come to the conclusion

01:41:26.538 --> 01:41:29.082
that your new defense system sucks.

01:41:30.834 --> 01:41:32.960
I don't have to take that,
you sack of shit!

01:41:33.128 --> 01:41:36.589
Oh, I was hoping for something
a little better than that from you,

01:41:36.757 --> 01:41:38.466
a man of your education.

01:41:38.634 --> 01:41:40.259
[Man] It's the president.

01:41:45.182 --> 01:41:48.101
Well, what are you gonna tell him?

01:41:49.561 --> 01:41:52.438
That I'm ordering our bombers
back to fail-safe.

01:41:52.856 --> 01:41:55.108
We might have to go through
this thing after all.

01:41:58.362 --> 01:41:59.320
Yes, sir.

01:41:59.655 --> 01:42:03.199
[Low humming, beeping]

01:42:06.870 --> 01:42:10.039
He's got one. When he gets 10,
he'll launch the missiles.

01:42:10.207 --> 01:42:11.624
Can't they stop it?

01:42:11.792 --> 01:42:14.001
No, they can't.

01:42:14.169 --> 01:42:15.962
[Beeping]

01:42:16.130 --> 01:42:19.048
They've taken out my password!

01:42:19.216 --> 01:42:20.341
What are we gonna do?

01:42:20.509 --> 01:42:22.176
I don't know. Do you?

01:42:22.553 --> 01:42:25.388
I told you not to start playing games
with that thing.

01:42:29.768 --> 01:42:30.893
It's games.

01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:35.565
- Games!
- Try it.

01:42:35.732 --> 01:42:37.191
John, let's feed it a tapeworm.

01:42:37.359 --> 01:42:40.403
- It might smash the system.
- The kid get in by the back door?

01:42:40.571 --> 01:42:42.697
- We took it out.
- Can we invade the deep logic?

01:42:42.865 --> 01:42:44.448
We keep hitting a firewall.

01:42:44.616 --> 01:42:46.200
If it wants to play a game, then play.

01:42:46.368 --> 01:42:48.536
- Have it list games.
- Stephen, for chrissake!

01:42:48.704 --> 01:42:50.288
[Jennifer] Let him!
He's played it before.

01:42:50.455 --> 01:42:52.331
- He can't do any worse.
- [Pat] Two numbers.

01:42:52.499 --> 01:42:55.835
I'd piss on a spark plug
if I thought it'd do any good.

01:42:56.003 --> 01:42:57.461
Let the boy in there.

01:42:57.629 --> 01:42:58.713
List games.

01:43:04.970 --> 01:43:06.137
"Chess."

01:43:09.433 --> 01:43:11.142
[Buzzer sounds]

01:43:13.604 --> 01:43:15.271
Three numbers locked in.

01:43:15.439 --> 01:43:16.689
"Poker."

01:43:18.275 --> 01:43:19.066
[Buzzer sounds]

01:43:19.234 --> 01:43:22.111
[Man] The security system's not gonna
let anything through.

01:43:25.616 --> 01:43:27.325
"Global thermonuclear war."

01:43:31.997 --> 01:43:33.581
[Beeping]

01:43:36.335 --> 01:43:37.543
[Pat] Four numbers.

01:43:38.128 --> 01:43:39.795
[Buzzer sounds]

01:43:39.963 --> 01:43:42.006
Stephen, for chrissake, do something.

01:43:42.174 --> 01:43:44.800
- Come on, kid. Let's go.
- No. Try again.

01:43:48.263 --> 01:43:50.181
- Put the list back up.
- We tried that.

01:43:50.349 --> 01:43:52.183
- Put it up!
- Yes, put it up.

01:44:00.484 --> 01:44:03.027
- It's not on the list!
- What's not on the list?

01:44:03.195 --> 01:44:05.071
It's gotta be in there.

01:44:08.116 --> 01:44:10.993
"Tic-tac-toe."

01:44:17.668 --> 01:44:18.668
You're in.

01:44:19.211 --> 01:44:21.462
- [Man] Order to disarm the missiles.
- No. No.

01:44:24.675 --> 01:44:26.175
[Buzzer sounds]

01:44:31.265 --> 01:44:33.349
Five numbers. It's got half the code.

01:44:35.394 --> 01:44:36.602
One.

01:44:38.480 --> 01:44:40.523
- Put X in the center.
- I know.

01:44:51.827 --> 01:44:53.828
- [Pat] Six up.
- [Man] You can't win that game.

01:44:53.996 --> 01:44:57.039
I know that. It doesn't.
It hasn't learned.

01:44:57.207 --> 01:44:59.292
Can you make it play itself?

01:45:00.252 --> 01:45:01.877
Yes. Number of players: Zero.

01:45:10.721 --> 01:45:14.390
[Beeping]

01:45:23.150 --> 01:45:24.108
Seven!

01:45:24.276 --> 01:45:26.944
Come on. Learn, goddamn it!

01:45:28.530 --> 01:45:31.907
[Rapid beeping]

01:45:39.791 --> 01:45:40.833
Eight!

01:45:41.001 --> 01:45:42.501
[Paul] Must be caught in a loop.

01:45:42.669 --> 01:45:45.421
It's drawing more power
from the rest of the system.

01:45:46.965 --> 01:45:48.341
[Pat] Nine numbers!

01:45:51.553 --> 01:45:52.345
[Rapid beeping]

01:45:52.512 --> 01:45:55.431
Ten! It's got the code.
It'll launch!

01:46:09.613 --> 01:46:11.072
- [Explosion]
- [Screams]

01:46:14.159 --> 01:46:16.786
[Man] Colonel Conley, call SAC
for a launch status report.

01:46:19.331 --> 01:46:21.332
- Get me the president.
- Yes, sir.

01:46:30.634 --> 01:46:48.484
[Low rumbling]

01:46:54.783 --> 01:46:55.741
How you doing?

01:46:55.909 --> 01:46:59.328
Our land lines are dead. I'm trying
to break through on satellites.

01:47:12.759 --> 01:47:16.178
[Radio feedback]

01:47:20.183 --> 01:47:23.060
[Overlapping indistinct chatter]

01:47:24.604 --> 01:47:26.021
What's it doing?

01:47:26.189 --> 01:47:27.356
It's learning.

01:48:14.988 --> 01:48:17.781
[Joshua] Greetings, Professor Falken.

01:48:26.917 --> 01:48:27.917
"Hello...

01:48:28.460 --> 01:48:29.585
...Joshua."

01:48:30.712 --> 01:48:31.962
Strange game.

01:48:32.130 --> 01:48:36.091
The only winning move
is not to play.

01:48:43.767 --> 01:48:48.020
How about a nice game of chess?

01:48:50.148 --> 01:48:54.151
[Indistinct cheering]

01:49:23.598 --> 01:49:24.848
Colonel Conley...

01:49:25.684 --> 01:49:28.435
...take us to DEFCON 5.
- Yes, sir.
