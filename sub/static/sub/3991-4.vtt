WEBVTT

00:02.570 --> 00:05.323
- Previously on Hannibal...
- Garrett Jacob Hobbs

00:05.370 --> 00:07.065
didn't kill Cassie Boyle.
- I know.

00:07.100 --> 00:09.204
- Dad? It's for you.

00:09.240 --> 00:11.231
- I believe the as yet
unidentified caller

00:11.270 --> 00:12.498
was our copycat killer.

00:14.680 --> 00:18.639
- I wanna go home. You do this
a lot? Go places and think
about killing?

00:18.680 --> 00:20.272
- Too often.

00:20.320 --> 00:22.117
- Abigail!
(screaming)

00:22.150 --> 00:23.788
- I didn't kill that girl...

00:23.820 --> 00:26.812
- This is not self-defence,
Abigail. You butchered him.

00:26.860 --> 00:30.159
- You're the one
who called the house.
- If I keep your secret...

00:30.190 --> 00:31.452
- Then I'll keep yours.

00:36.770 --> 00:40.228
- Sometimes, at night,

00:40.270 --> 00:42.306
I leave the lights on

00:42.340 --> 00:44.661
in my little house

00:44.710 --> 00:48.305
and walk across
the flat fields...

00:48.340 --> 00:51.844
And when I look back
from a distance,

00:51.880 --> 00:54.610
the house is like
a boat on the sea.

00:57.490 --> 01:00.516
It's really the only time
I feel safe.

01:03.190 --> 01:06.091
- You stood in
the breathing silence of
Garrett Jacob Hobbs's home.

01:06.130 --> 01:08.849
The very spaces
he moved through.

01:08.900 --> 01:12.666
Tell me, Will...
Did they speak to you?

01:15.500 --> 01:18.867
- Noise and clarity.

01:18.910 --> 01:20.878
- You could sense his madness.

01:20.910 --> 01:22.878
Like a bloodhound.

01:22.910 --> 01:26.710
- I tried so hard to know
Garrett Jacob Hobbs.

01:26.750 --> 01:29.116
- No, no, no!

01:29.150 --> 01:31.516
- To see him.

01:31.550 --> 01:33.689
Garrett Jacob Hobbs, FBI!

01:35.520 --> 01:36.851
(gunshot)

01:36.890 --> 01:41.793
Past the slides and vials,

01:41.830 --> 01:44.264
beyond the lines
of the police reports,

01:44.300 --> 01:48.236
between the pixels
of all those...

01:48.270 --> 01:50.306
printed faces

01:50.340 --> 01:52.774
of sad, dead girls.

01:55.510 --> 01:57.671
- See...

02:00.220 --> 02:03.144
- How did you feel
seeing Melissa Shule,

02:03.190 --> 02:05.181
impaled in his antler room?

02:11.860 --> 02:13.828
- Guilty.

02:13.860 --> 02:15.828
- Because you couldn't save her?

02:15.860 --> 02:19.637
- Because I felt
like I killed her.

02:22.810 --> 02:27.531
I got so close to him...

02:27.580 --> 02:30.469
Sometimes, I felt like

02:30.510 --> 02:33.240
we were doing the same things
at different times of day.

02:33.280 --> 02:35.441
Like I was eating

02:35.480 --> 02:38.313
or showering or sleeping
at the same time he was.

02:38.350 --> 02:41.285
- Even after he was dead?

02:42.890 --> 02:45.688
- Yeah, even after he was dead.

02:45.730 --> 02:49.461
- Like... you were becoming him.

02:49.500 --> 02:53.288
- I know who I am.

02:53.340 --> 02:55.729
I'm not Garrett Jacob Hobbs,
Dr. Lecter.

03:47.520 --> 03:50.523
(sound of heart beating)

03:54.900 --> 03:58.927
(heart beating)

04:13.450 --> 04:16.681
(inhaling)

04:16.720 --> 04:18.938
- Table has been set.

04:18.990 --> 04:21.879
Family dinner.

04:21.920 --> 04:25.287
I wasn't invited.

04:25.330 --> 04:28.595
I take my seat
at the head of the table.

04:28.630 --> 04:31.963
My seat, my place setting

04:32.000 --> 04:35.561
next to Mrs. Turner.

04:35.600 --> 04:39.058
I am the guest of honour.

04:39.110 --> 04:41.305
Nobody's taken a bite
of their dinner.

04:41.340 --> 04:43.979
If you don't eat
your growing foods,

04:44.010 --> 04:46.001
you won't get any dessert.

04:49.490 --> 04:54.610
No one leaves the table!

04:54.660 --> 04:57.356
All afraid to move.

04:57.390 --> 04:59.995
Even the little ones
behave themselves.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.924
I brought my own family

05:04.970 --> 05:07.666
to this home invasion,
controlling the Turners

05:07.700 --> 05:10.407
with threats of violence.

05:10.440 --> 05:14.877
Threats that turn to action.

05:14.910 --> 05:19.347
(gunshots)

05:19.380 --> 05:22.042
(woman crying)

05:24.050 --> 05:26.780
The Turner family
is executed simultaneously,

05:26.820 --> 05:29.653
with the exception
of Mrs. Turner,

05:29.690 --> 05:32.488
who dies last.

05:32.530 --> 05:35.749
This is my design.

05:35.800 --> 05:38.519
I shoot Mrs. Turner.

05:50.010 --> 05:52.911
- What do you see, Will?

05:55.850 --> 05:57.841
- Family values.

05:59.860 --> 06:02.784
- Whose family values?

07:11.590 --> 07:13.922
(He plays a few notes.)

08:26.700 --> 08:29.669
- Alright, Karen
and Roger Turner--

08:29.710 --> 08:32.531
Childhood sweethearts.
Owned a successful

08:32.580 --> 08:35.674
real estate business. Pillars of
the community. Three children.

08:35.710 --> 08:38.042
- Minus one.
- Uh, a son.

08:38.080 --> 08:42.949
Jesse. Disappeared last year.
Last confirmed sighting
had him boarding an RV

08:42.990 --> 08:45.049
at a rest stop
on Route 47.

08:45.090 --> 08:47.308
Possible runaway,
probable abduction.

08:47.360 --> 08:50.682
- Or both.
- When misery rains, it pours.

08:50.730 --> 08:53.096
_ - Fa_lse faces_
In family portraits.

08:53.130 --> 08:55.291
Layers and layers of lies

08:55.330 --> 08:57.924
betrayed by a sad glint

08:57.970 --> 08:59.835
in a child's eyes.

08:59.870 --> 09:02.259
- Norman Rockwell with a bullet.

09:02.300 --> 09:04.268
- Alright, any signs

09:04.310 --> 09:06.608
of forced entry?
- No broken windows
or torn screens.

09:06.640 --> 09:09.973
It's all sealed up tight.
- Yeah, they probably
rang the front door.

09:10.010 --> 09:14.219
- I got bullet holes on the
upper sections of the wall,
and again over here.

09:14.250 --> 09:16.582
- Okay. Pull the slugs
for ballistics.

09:16.620 --> 09:19.612
- If they aren't frangible,
it shouldn't be a problem.
- Those elevated

09:19.660 --> 09:23.118
termination points match
what I see on these bodies.
You got angular cranial Impact

09:23.160 --> 09:25.754
coupled with acute
exit wounds, conical spray.

09:25.790 --> 09:28.122
Shooter went low to high.
Probably crouching.

09:28.160 --> 09:30.162
- When was Jesse abducted?

09:30.200 --> 09:32.293
- Uh, a little over a year ago.

09:52.320 --> 09:54.959
- I can hide
what happened to me.

09:54.990 --> 09:57.879
All I need is a scarf to pass.

09:57.930 --> 10:01.149
- Hiding what happened to you
defeats the purpose
of being here.

10:01.200 --> 10:03.919
Sharing will help normalize.

10:03.970 --> 10:06.894
- I'm not normal. Not anymore.

10:06.940 --> 10:09.807
- What happened
to you isn't normal.

10:09.840 --> 10:11.831
- Some of these women
aren't even sharing.

10:11.870 --> 10:14.077
They speak in
little girl voices,

10:14.110 --> 10:17.045
telling everyone what was done
to them without saying
a word about it.

10:17.080 --> 10:21.073
- Certain traumas can arrest
vocal development...

10:23.350 --> 10:26.649
broadcast victi_mhood
Involuntarlly.

10:26.690 --> 10:29.682
- Not me.

10:29.730 --> 10:31.823
- Well, that's not
necessarily true.

10:33.230 --> 10:35.221
Your victimhood
has a high profile.

10:35.260 --> 10:38.058
- I'm a celebrity victim.

10:38.100 --> 10:42.036
Someone here asked me
ifI kept my stained clothes.

10:42.070 --> 10:43.958
- How did that make you feel?

10:44.010 --> 10:47.275
- Like I wanted to go home...

10:47.310 --> 10:50.074
But I don't have a home
anymore, do I?

10:50.110 --> 10:53.841
- You will. You will.
I'll help you find it.

10:55.850 --> 10:59.809
Abigail, I'd like you to give
the support group another
chance.

10:59.860 --> 11:02.454
- Support groups are sucking
the life out of me.

11:02.490 --> 11:05.186
- Well, isolation
can suck just as much.

11:05.230 --> 11:07.994
You have to find
someone to relate to

11:08.030 --> 11:11.363
in this experience.

11:11.400 --> 11:15.439
(classical music playing)
(knock on door)

11:17.410 --> 11:20.379
- Hi.
- Do you have an appointment?

11:20.410 --> 11:22.401
- Do you have a beer?

11:31.150 --> 11:33.857
- Interesting day with Abigail.

11:37.460 --> 11:39.894
- Yeah, the grief work,

11:39.930 --> 11:41.898
trauma intervention...

11:41.930 --> 11:44.763
it's all on course.

11:44.800 --> 11:48.861
I think she might be wrestling
with a low-grade depression.

11:48.900 --> 11:51.733
- She?

11:51.770 --> 11:53.738
- Nothing wrong with a little...

11:53.780 --> 11:55.839
self-medication, right, doctor?

11:59.920 --> 12:01.945
Professional neutrality
be damned.

12:01.980 --> 12:05.143
So hard to watch a bright
young girl go so adrift.

12:05.190 --> 12:07.158
- Perhaps it's time

12:07.190 --> 12:09.852
Abigail's released
from clinical treatment.

12:09.890 --> 12:13.223
- Released where?
Back into the wild?

12:13.260 --> 12:17.026
- Spending each day immersed
in tragedy may be doing
more harm than good.

12:17.070 --> 12:20.039
She should be out in the world -
finding her footing,

12:20.070 --> 12:22.163
giving her the confidence
to move forward.

12:22.200 --> 12:25.306
- Abigail's in no condition
to tackle what_ real world
Issues lIke--

12:25.340 --> 12:29.948
- I'm not suggesting
abandonment.

12:29.980 --> 12:33.040
- Hannibal, this is a girl
who was very attached
to her parents,

12:33.080 --> 12:36.311
and you stepping in
as a surrogate would
only be a crutch.

12:36.350 --> 12:39.444
I think Abigail needs to figure
things out for herself

12:39.490 --> 12:41.879
in a safe, clinical environment

12:41.920 --> 12:43.922
and that will give her

12:43.960 --> 12:46.485
the confidence to move forward.
- I defer to the passion

12:46.530 --> 12:48.498
of my esteemed colleague.

12:48.530 --> 12:50.293
Passion's good.

12:50.330 --> 12:52.935
Gets blood pumping.

12:56.100 --> 12:59.035
- I'm glad we didn't
have guns in my house.

12:59.070 --> 13:02.198
Would've shot my sisters just
to get 'em out of the bathroom.
- I liked having a big family.

13:02.240 --> 13:06.347
- My parents gave me a gift--
a twin. Who wouldn't want
two of me?

13:06.380 --> 13:09.213
- Let me guess--
only child.

13:09.250 --> 13:12.583
- Why do you say that?
- 'Cause family friction is

13:12.620 --> 13:15.259
usually a catalyst
for personality development.

13:15.290 --> 13:19.329
- I was the oldest, so all
the friction rolled downhill.

13:19.360 --> 13:23.319
- Yes, all the attention
and responsibilities heaped
on first-born children

13:23.370 --> 13:26.225
prepares them for success
in the future.

13:26.270 --> 13:29.239
- My baby sister got away
with murder.

13:29.270 --> 13:32.239
She had 'em all fooled.
- I thought middles
were the problem.

13:32.270 --> 13:35.535
- Middle's the sweet spot.
- Always trying to figure out
where they fit in.

13:37.310 --> 13:39.449
They can be great,
um, politicians.

13:41.180 --> 13:42.989
Or lousy ones.

13:43.020 --> 13:46.854
- All the victims have defensive
wounds except for Mrs. Turner.

13:48.560 --> 13:50.858
- There's forgiveness.

13:50.890 --> 13:54.121
- What kind of victim forgives
the killer at the moment
of death?

13:57.270 --> 13:59.261
- A mother.

14:06.910 --> 14:10.402
- Tell me about your mother.
- That's some lazy psychiatry,
Dr. Lecter.

14:10.450 --> 14:12.543
Low hanging fruit.

14:12.580 --> 14:16.016
- I suspect that fruit
is on a high branch.

14:16.050 --> 14:18.018
Very difficult to reach.

14:18.050 --> 14:21.281
- So is my mother.
Never knew her.

14:21.320 --> 14:23.424
- An interesting place to start.

14:25.430 --> 14:28.558
- Tell me about your mother.
Let's start there.

14:30.570 --> 14:33.459
- Both my parents died
when I was very young.

14:33.500 --> 14:35.889
The proverbial orphan
until I was adopted

14:35.940 --> 14:38.465
by my Uncle Robertas
when I was 16.

14:38.510 --> 14:41.308
- You have orphan in common
with Abigail Hobbs.

14:41.340 --> 14:43.501
- I think we'll discover
you and I have a great deal

14:43.550 --> 14:45.643
in common with Abigail.

14:45.680 --> 14:49.616
She's already demonstrated an
aptitude for the psychological.

14:51.620 --> 14:55.317
- Something so foreign
about family...

14:55.360 --> 14:58.022
Like an ill-fitting suit.

14:58.060 --> 15:00.426
I never connected
to the concept.

15:00.460 --> 15:03.691
- You created
a family for yourself.

15:03.730 --> 15:07.393
- Ah, well, I connected
a family of strays.

15:07.440 --> 15:10.238
And thank you
for feeding them

15:10.270 --> 15:13.398
while I was away.

15:13.440 --> 15:15.635
- I was referring to Abigail.

15:21.380 --> 15:24.588
Tell me about the Turner family.
Were they affluent? Well to do?

15:24.620 --> 15:26.611
- They lived like
they had money.

15:26.650 --> 15:30.222
- Did your family
have money, Will?
- We were poor.

15:30.260 --> 15:33.388
I followed my father
from the boatyards

15:33.430 --> 15:36.194
of Biloxi and Greenville

15:36.230 --> 15:39.324
to, uh, lake boats on Erie.

15:39.370 --> 15:42.089
- Always the new boy at school.
Always the stranger.

15:42.140 --> 15:44.005
- Always.

15:44.040 --> 15:47.271
- What grudge was Mrs. Turner's
killer harboring against her?

15:47.310 --> 15:51.098
- Motherhood.

15:51.150 --> 15:53.368
- Not motherhood.

15:53.420 --> 15:55.411
A perversion of it.

15:59.050 --> 16:02.110
- A modified Boudin Noir

16:02.160 --> 16:04.685
from Ali-Bab's
GastronomIe pratIque.

16:06.560 --> 16:09.393
You promised to deliver
your wife to my dinner table.

16:09.430 --> 16:11.523
- Well, we're gonna have
to polish up our act.

16:11.570 --> 16:15.392
We can't have you diagnosing
our marital problems
all in one fell swoop.

16:15.440 --> 16:17.408
What_ am I about
to put In my mouth?

16:17.440 --> 16:21.536
- Rabbit.
- He should've hopped faster.
- Yes, he should have.

16:21.580 --> 16:23.673
(screaming)

16:23.710 --> 16:26.372
But fortunately
for us, he did not.

16:26.410 --> 16:28.412
- Mm-mm-mm.

16:30.420 --> 16:33.651
Our friend Will
seems haunted today.

16:33.690 --> 16:37.057
- We don't know what nightmares
lie coiled beneath
Will's pillow.

16:37.090 --> 16:39.183
- Children killing
other children

16:39.230 --> 16:41.755
is not that unfamiliar
a notion to Will.

16:41.800 --> 16:44.291
- You still suspect Abigail
Hobbs in her father's crimes.

16:44.330 --> 16:47.163
- Perhaps the nightmare
under Will's pillow

16:47.200 --> 16:50.169
is that he was wrong about her.

16:50.210 --> 16:52.667
- Children transport us
to our childhoods.

16:52.710 --> 16:56.476
Will may feel the tug of life
before the FBI. Before you.

16:56.510 --> 16:59.308
Simpler times
in boatyards with Dad.

16:59.350 --> 17:04.310
That life is an anchor stringed
behind him in heavy weather.

17:04.350 --> 17:08.059
He needs an anchor, Jack.

17:37.520 --> 17:40.785
- One pair size 6 sneakers
from the Turner house.

17:40.820 --> 17:43.857
Tread on left indicates
uneven leg length.
- Is that unusual?

17:43.890 --> 17:46.552
- Not in a 12-year-old. Growth
plates are all out of whack.

17:46.590 --> 17:49.297
You've got one foot
that's bigger,

17:49.330 --> 17:52.390
one leg that's longer.
Puberty in full-effect.

17:52.430 --> 17:55.695
- How did Jesse Turner turn out?
No one's seen mm In
over a year.

17:55.740 --> 17:59.107
- I extrapolated the, uh,
present height and weight
from abduction stats.

17:59.140 --> 18:01.176
Even with the usual growth spurt
between 11 and 12,

18:01.210 --> 18:03.542
he'd be 4-and-a-half feet,
80 pounds tops.

18:03.580 --> 18:05.798
- God's gift to
trace analysts.

18:05.850 --> 18:08.239
Greasy fingerprints
all over these things!

18:08.280 --> 18:10.510
No matches,
but they're gorgeous.

18:10.550 --> 18:13.280
- Isolated 7 pairs
of shoe prints,

18:13.320 --> 18:15.379
filtered out the Turners,
including Jesse's.

18:15.420 --> 18:17.422
So, we're down to three UNSUBS.

18:17.460 --> 18:20.122
Sneakers are size 7,
3 and a half, and a boy's 11.

18:20.160 --> 18:24.824
- The Lost Boys.
- I think I found one of 'em.

18:24.870 --> 18:28.465
- Most of the time in sexual
assaults, the bite mark

18:28.500 --> 18:31.264
has a livid spot at the center--

18:31.310 --> 18:33.801
a suck bruise.

18:33.840 --> 18:37.571
In some cases, it does not.
For some killers, biting may be

18:37.610 --> 18:40.579
a fighting pattern as much
as a sexual behavior-
- Alright,

18:40.620 --> 18:42.474
class dismissed. Everyone out.

18:42.520 --> 18:45.182
What did I just say? Let's go!

18:53.360 --> 18:56.329
- You're making it difficult
to provide an education, Jack.

18:56.360 --> 18:59.420
- We found a match to
a set of prints we pulled
from the Turner home

18:59.470 --> 19:02.439
and they belong to a 13-year-old
boy from Reston, Virginia.

19:02.470 --> 19:05.735
His name is Conner Frist.
- Another kid?
- Another missing kid.

19:05.770 --> 19:09.638
He vanished 10 months ago.
The case was never solved.

19:09.680 --> 19:13.468
- How many kids
in the Frist family?

19:13.520 --> 19:17.889
- Three, just like
the Turner family.

19:17.920 --> 19:19.888
We're ready to go when you are,
and you're ready to go now,

19:19.920 --> 19:21.649
so let's go.

19:21.690 --> 19:24.284
- You're expecting
a crime scene.

19:24.330 --> 19:26.719
- Yes, I am.

19:26.760 --> 19:30.264
(festive music)

19:33.640 --> 19:37.929
- ** There is no Christmas

19:37.970 --> 19:42.430
* Like a home Christmas

19:42.480 --> 19:49.773
* With your dad and mom
and sis and brother there *

19:49.820 --> 19:54.314
* With their hearts humming
(coughing)

19:54.360 --> 19:58.785
* At your homecoming
(coughing)

19:58.830 --> 20:04.826
* And that merry yuletide spirit
in the air **

20:09.470 --> 20:11.665
- Mr. Frist and the children
killed first,

20:11.710 --> 20:15.407
saving Mrs. Frist for last.
Same as the Turners.

20:15.440 --> 20:17.647
- Well, not
exactly the same.

20:17.680 --> 20:21.639
Something went wrong.
- Not a single present
under the tree for Mrs. Frist.

20:21.680 --> 20:24.683
- He took her presents.
He took her motherhood.

20:24.720 --> 20:27.553
- Shooting her once wasn't
enough. First bullet

20:27.590 --> 20:30.252
travels beneath her scalp

20:30.290 --> 20:33.396
to its final resting place--
base of her neck.
- It still didn't kill her.

20:33.430 --> 20:35.648
- Hydrostatic shock of shell
hitting skull would've caused
brain damage.

20:35.700 --> 20:37.520
- Her body went
into convulsions.

20:37.570 --> 20:41.529
- Shot her again. Put her out
of her misery. Different gun.

20:41.570 --> 20:43.367
- So, someone else
shot Conner's mom.

20:43.410 --> 20:46.402
- So_who is
our addItIonal corpse

20:46.440 --> 20:48.032
in the fireplace?

20:48.080 --> 20:50.275
- I'd say Conner Frist.

20:50.310 --> 20:53.416
He had been prepped to shoot his
mother, not watch her suffer.

20:53.450 --> 20:56.647
- Conner couldn't put
his panic back in a bottle,
so he got shot too.

20:56.680 --> 20:59.911
- Whoever shot him

20:59.950 --> 21:02.953
disowned him.

21:11.770 --> 21:13.738
- Don't be sad
about Conner.

21:13.770 --> 21:17.604
- I guess I couldn't
make him understand.

21:19.610 --> 21:22.329
The family you're born into
isn't really family.

21:24.610 --> 21:27.613
You have to make family.
That's what we're doing.
We're making our family.

21:27.650 --> 21:29.709
- What happened to your family?

21:29.750 --> 21:31.638
- We're her family.

21:31.690 --> 21:35.786
- I meant your other family.

21:35.820 --> 21:38.789
- The family you think is family
is just a stepping-stone

21:38.830 --> 21:41.355
to real family.

21:43.030 --> 21:46.921
Are you feeling okay,
sweetie pie?

21:46.970 --> 21:48.892
- He's fine.

21:48.940 --> 21:50.965
- C.J.

21:59.850 --> 22:02.341
You should be excited
to go home. Even if it is

22:02.380 --> 22:04.848
to say goodbye. 'Cause we're
your family now, Christopher.

22:06.090 --> 22:10.424
You can only have one family.

22:24.840 --> 22:27.400
- Ever heard

22:27.440 --> 22:29.908
of Willard Wigan?

22:29.940 --> 22:33.569
He's this artist that does
mIcro-sculptures,

22:33.620 --> 22:37.386
like putting the Obamas in the
eye of a needle. He's so focused

22:37.420 --> 22:39.911
that he can work between
beats of his heart.

22:39.950 --> 22:41.918
I guess archers do
the same thing, right?

22:41.960 --> 22:44.451
-Hm? _
- What are you lookIng at?

22:44.490 --> 22:46.549
- Both these kids are small.

22:46.590 --> 22:48.729
Underweight for their age.

22:48.760 --> 22:52.423
- You think there's
a connectIon?

22:52.470 --> 22:55.462
- I'm thinking possible ADHD
diagnoses for both boys--

22:55.500 --> 22:58.833
Ritalin, Focalin,
any medication

22:58.870 --> 23:01.430
containing methylphenidate
can affect appetite

23:01.480 --> 23:03.607
and slow long-term
growth in kids.

23:03.650 --> 23:06.744
- Another thing
about Willard Wigan.

23:06.780 --> 23:10.409
He had a lonely childhood.
He used his tiny sculptures

23:10.450 --> 23:13.658
as an escape.
- Who's Willard Wigan?

23:15.660 --> 23:17.719
- Price got a hit on the
ballistics-matching program

23:17.760 --> 23:19.728
he's been running
on the two family murders.

23:19.760 --> 23:22.524
The bullet that put
Mrs. Frist out of her misery

23:22.560 --> 23:26.018
_matches 3 used in a murder
In Bangor, MaIne a year ago.

23:26.070 --> 23:29.892
Mother of a 13-year-old boy
shot to death with her own gun.

23:29.940 --> 23:32.204
- 13-year-old

23:32.240 --> 23:35.505
milk carton material?

23:35.540 --> 23:38.646
- C.J. Lincoln disappeared
6 months before his
mother's murder,

23:38.680 --> 23:40.648
hasn't been seen since.

23:40.680 --> 23:42.648
- He has none of the
characteristics of a sadist

23:42.680 --> 23:44.910
or sociopath.
- Right. No shoplifting,

23:44.950 --> 23:47.612
no malicious destruction
of property, no assault,
no battery.

23:47.660 --> 23:49.685
He was kind to animals,
for god's sakes.

23:49.720 --> 23:52.928
- The firearm says we are
looking at Peter Pan
to our lost boys.

23:52.960 --> 23:55.997
- But it takes a sophisticated
level of manipulation

23:56.030 --> 23:58.590
to convince young boys to kill
their families in cold blood.

23:58.630 --> 24:01.531
- Kindness to animals doesn't
suggest that partIcular kInd
of sophistication.

24:01.570 --> 24:04.767
- Well, he's older.
He's been out in the world.

24:04.810 --> 24:08.007
Maybe he picked up a few things.

24:19.620 --> 24:21.110
Here you go.

24:32.070 --> 24:34.561
- Thank you so much.

24:34.600 --> 24:36.067
Oh, honey!

24:36.100 --> 24:39.035
Jeez... Are you
feeling okay, honey?

24:39.070 --> 24:42.801
You have a fever?

24:42.840 --> 24:44.842
You don't feel warm...
- Here you go, ma'am.

24:44.880 --> 24:47.849
- Oh, thank you.
He's never done this before.

24:47.880 --> 24:50.678
I'll pay for the napkins.
- Don't worry about it.

24:50.720 --> 24:53.917
- Oh, honey... Oh, Jesus.

24:53.960 --> 24:55.518
I'm so embarrassed.

24:57.890 --> 25:01.121
Ah... but you shouldn't feel
embarrassed. This happens
with little bladders, right?

25:01.160 --> 25:04.220
Right?

25:12.610 --> 25:15.738
- Good evening, Will.

25:15.780 --> 25:17.702
Please come in.

25:19.150 --> 25:22.017
Has Christmas come early?

25:22.050 --> 25:23.540
Or late?

25:24.620 --> 25:27.714
- It was for Abigail.
- Was?

25:27.760 --> 25:30.786
- I thought better of it.
I wasn't thinking straight.
I was... I was upset

25:30.830 --> 25:33.856
when I bought it.
Maybe still am.

25:33.900 --> 25:37.620
- What is it?
- Magnifying glass.

25:37.670 --> 25:40.594
Fly-tying gear.

25:40.640 --> 25:44.098
- Teaching her how to fish.

25:44.140 --> 25:47.598
Her father taught her
how to hunt.

25:47.640 --> 25:51.269
- That's why
I thought better of it.
- Feeling paternal, Will?

25:51.310 --> 25:53.642
- Aren't you?

25:53.680 --> 25:56.615
- Yes. Our good friend

25:56.650 --> 26:00.017
Dr. Bloom has advised against
taking too personal an interest

26:00.050 --> 26:01.756
in Abigail's welfare.

26:01.790 --> 26:04.725
Tell me, why are you so angry?

26:04.760 --> 26:06.728
- I'm angry
about those boys.

26:06.760 --> 26:08.853
I'm angry because I know when
I find them I can't help them.

26:08.900 --> 26:12.063
I can't-I can't give them back
what they just gave away.

26:12.100 --> 26:13.863
- Family.

26:13.900 --> 26:16.767
- Yeah.

26:16.800 --> 26:21.078
We call them
"the lost boys."

26:21.110 --> 26:24.204
- Abigail's lost too...

26:26.210 --> 26:28.917
And perhaps it's our
responsibility, yours and mine,

26:28.950 --> 26:32.215
to help her find her way.

26:38.690 --> 26:40.920
- I don't think
I'm allowed to leave

26:40.960 --> 26:43.053
after I climbed the fence.

26:43.100 --> 26:46.319
- I've made arrangements.
You could say

26:46.370 --> 26:49.339
I'm one of your guardians.

26:49.370 --> 26:51.930
- Where are we going?
- Home.

26:51.970 --> 26:53.938
My home.

26:53.980 --> 26:56.335
I thought you might enjoy
if I cooked for you.

26:56.380 --> 27:00.339
I'll have you back
before bedtime.
- Can I spend the night?

27:00.380 --> 27:04.817
I don't like sleeping here.
I have bad dreams.

27:04.850 --> 27:07.978
- You have to sleep
in your own bed.

27:08.020 --> 27:11.228
- This isn't my bed.

27:11.260 --> 27:13.956
- Tell me about
your bad dreams.

27:16.700 --> 27:19.794
- I had one where...

27:19.830 --> 27:22.993
Marisa was sending me
picture texts,

27:23.040 --> 27:26.066
like, crime scene photos

27:26.110 --> 27:29.079
of Nicholas Boyle gutted.

27:29.110 --> 27:31.408
- How you left him.

27:38.190 --> 27:40.988
Even though she's dead,
I'm afraid that Marisa's
gonna tell everyone

27:41.020 --> 27:43.284
I killed him and they'll think
I'm just like my dad.

27:45.290 --> 27:48.259
Sorry.

27:48.300 --> 27:50.256
I can't really talk about this

27:50.300 --> 27:52.359
in group.

27:52.400 --> 27:54.265
- You don't have that luxury,
Abigail.

27:54.300 --> 27:57.292
- It's just hard
to get used to lying.

28:01.780 --> 28:05.147
- Only have to lie
about one thing.

28:05.180 --> 28:09.139
And when you're with me,
you don't have to lie
about anything.

28:09.180 --> 28:12.183
- In the dream, I wonder

28:12.220 --> 28:14.950
how I could live with myself

28:14.990 --> 28:17.720
knowing what I did.

28:17.760 --> 28:20.479
- And when
you're awake?

28:20.530 --> 28:24.261
- When I'm awake, I know
I can live with myself.

28:24.300 --> 28:26.996
And I know I'll just
get used to what I did.

28:28.940 --> 28:31.761
Does that make me a sociopath?
- No.

28:31.810 --> 28:35.268
It makes you a survivor.

29:02.340 --> 29:04.535
It's important to know when
it's time to turn the page.

29:04.570 --> 29:07.437
Have you thought about
applying for schools?

29:07.470 --> 29:10.177
- My dad killed girls

29:10.210 --> 29:12.178
at all the schools I applied to.

29:12.210 --> 29:15.418
- Perhaps that can wait then.

29:15.450 --> 29:17.941
- I wanna work for the FBI.

29:20.290 --> 29:23.350
- I would certainly feel safer
if you were in the FBI,

29:23.390 --> 29:25.358
protecting my interests.

29:25.390 --> 29:28.359
- They wouldn't let me,
though, would they?

29:28.400 --> 29:31.062
'Cause of what my dad did.

29:31.100 --> 29:33.830
- Only if they believe
that's in your nature too.

29:33.870 --> 29:35.428
- Nature versus nurture.

29:35.470 --> 29:39.338
- You're not your father's
daughter. Not anymore.

29:45.110 --> 29:47.476
- What if it weren't
so paInful anymore?

29:47.510 --> 29:49.478
To think of him.

29:49.520 --> 29:52.216
- My dad?

29:52.250 --> 29:55.811
- Yes.

29:55.860 --> 29:58.454
Have you ever tried psilocybin?

29:58.490 --> 30:00.458
- Mushrooms.

30:00.490 --> 30:03.095
That's what's
in the tea?

30:03.130 --> 30:05.928
- Yes. There are those
psychIatrIsts who beIIeve

30:05.970 --> 30:08.837
that altered states
could be used to access
traumatIc memorIes.

30:08.870 --> 30:11.532
- I have all the access to
traumatIc memorIes I need.

30:11.570 --> 30:14.334
Unlimited access.
- Which is why we need

30:14.380 --> 30:17.076
to supplement them with
positive associations.

30:17.110 --> 30:19.044
No more bad dreams, Abigail.

30:21.020 --> 30:23.614
- You want me to do drugs.

30:23.650 --> 30:27.279
- I want you to do this drug.
With my supervision.

30:27.320 --> 30:29.311
Where it's safe.

30:31.330 --> 30:33.423
Do you trust me?

30:50.140 --> 30:52.574
- Bangor, Maine.

30:52.610 --> 30:54.578
Stamford, Connecticut.

30:54.620 --> 30:56.872
And recently, Reston, Virginia.

30:56.920 --> 30:59.411
- This places each of the
murders approximately 500 miles

30:59.450 --> 31:01.509
from the one before it.
- Right.

31:01.560 --> 31:04.358
- You're trying to establish
a geographical pattern

31:04.390 --> 31:07.553
when the murders
were weeks apart.
- Other patterns too.

31:07.590 --> 31:11.526
Intruders are minors, middle
children from traditional,
affluent families.

31:11.570 --> 31:14.038
- We know they're moving south,
so that means we wanna cover

31:14.070 --> 31:16.436
the border of North
Carolina and Georgia.

31:16.470 --> 31:19.462
We need to get files
on every missing boy

31:19.510 --> 31:22.331
within 200 miles
of North Carolina.
- There's a pattern...

31:22.380 --> 31:26.077
Less to do with geography
than psychology.

31:26.110 --> 31:28.271
- What kind
of kid does this?

31:28.320 --> 31:31.209
- And what kind of kid
follows a kid who does this?

31:31.250 --> 31:34.048
- There's no indication
that these kids came
from abusive families.

31:34.090 --> 31:36.308
- No, no, no.

31:36.360 --> 31:38.578
Capture bonding.

31:38.630 --> 31:42.623
It's a passive psychological
response to a new master.

31:42.660 --> 31:45.458
It's been an essential survival
tool for a mI||Ion years.

31:45.500 --> 31:49.391
You bond with your captor,
you survive.

31:49.440 --> 31:51.704
You don't,

31:51.740 --> 31:53.935
you're breakfast.

32:12.430 --> 32:14.990
- Just like we talked about.

32:26.440 --> 32:30.035
- Dr. Bloom said this was okay?

32:30.080 --> 32:31.502
- Not at all.

32:31.550 --> 32:33.541
We often have
a difference of opinion.

32:38.120 --> 32:41.055
- More secrets for us.
- Oh,

32:41.090 --> 32:44.548
you and I will have
many secrets.

32:48.760 --> 32:51.126
Infusing psilocybin
into the bloodstream

32:51.170 --> 32:54.389
before psychotherapy
can elicit a positive,

32:54.440 --> 32:56.499
even spiritual experience
in patients.

32:56.540 --> 32:59.509
Psychological trauma is an
affliction of the powerless.

32:59.540 --> 33:03.237
I want to give you
your power back.

33:03.280 --> 33:06.647
- I don't feel so good.

33:06.680 --> 33:10.411
- That feeling will pass.

33:10.450 --> 33:13.385
Allow it
to wash over you.

33:13.420 --> 33:16.059
Through you.

33:16.090 --> 33:18.024
Let me be your guide.

33:20.360 --> 33:22.521
- You're making breakfast
for dinner?

33:23.730 --> 33:27.097
- High Life eggs.

33:27.130 --> 33:30.736
A chef in Spain called Muro
claims he invented it
in the 19th century.

33:33.540 --> 33:37.431
Taste is not only biochemical.
It's also psychological.

33:37.480 --> 33:41.268
- Sausage and eggs
was_ the last meal I was
haVIng WIth my parents.

33:41.320 --> 33:43.413
- I know.

33:43.450 --> 33:47.079
It's also the first meal
you're haVIng WIth me.

33:48.620 --> 33:51.589
- Without the interference
of a leader, these kids
would never consider

33:51.630 --> 33:54.451
violent action.
- Our mIssmg kId's a boy.

33:54.500 --> 33:58.596
A paradox in the midst
of a normal family.

33:58.630 --> 34:01.360
He's an outsider who
doesn't look like one.

34:01.400 --> 34:04.460
He'd have a vocation--

34:04.510 --> 34:06.466
something inventive
or mechanical.

34:06.510 --> 34:09.707
- Here's one. Family moved
from Biloxi to Charleston

34:09.740 --> 34:12.345
to Fayetteville
in the last 3 years.

34:12.380 --> 34:15.747
He won a junior high award for
his work on pretty sophisticated
computer circuitry.

34:15.780 --> 34:18.089
- Why do you think these kids

34:18.120 --> 34:20.588
are susceptible to C.J. Lincoln?

34:20.620 --> 34:24.351
- Because they may have a
brother but their ages or their
interests keep them apart.

34:24.390 --> 34:26.620
So, he's a brother
without a brother.

34:26.660 --> 34:29.128
- Brothers looking
for a mother.

34:30.660 --> 34:35.268
They're killing
the mothers last.

34:40.270 --> 34:42.409
- Yeah?
- It's not just C.J. Lincoln.

34:42.440 --> 34:46.240
_ There's an adult
WIth some formatIve sway.

34:46.280 --> 34:48.214
It's a woman--
a mother figure, I think.

34:48.250 --> 34:50.639
She's looking to form a family.

34:50.680 --> 34:54.684
- Family can have a contagion
effect on some people

34:54.720 --> 34:56.813
that influences
them to adopt

34:56.860 --> 34:58.828
similar behaviors

34:58.860 --> 35:00.885
and attitudes.

35:00.930 --> 35:04.263
- Whoever this woman is,
she wants these children

35:04.300 --> 35:08.361
to burst with love for her.

35:08.400 --> 35:12.302
But she has to erase
their family to do that.
- So, she abducts them,

35:12.340 --> 35:15.537
convinces them no one can
love them as much as she does,

35:15.580 --> 35:19.243
and then makes damn sure of it.
- A securIty camera In, uh,

35:19.280 --> 35:21.874
_a convenience store
In AlexandrIa, VIrgInIa

35:21.920 --> 35:24.616
caught footage of one
Chris O'Halloran this morning.

35:24.650 --> 35:27.187
He was with
an unidentified woman.

35:27.220 --> 35:29.415
- Where's this
kid's parents?

35:29.460 --> 35:31.758
- Fayetteville,
North Carolina.

35:49.510 --> 35:52.502
- Christopher?
- Hi, Mom.

35:58.220 --> 36:02.316
Oh, my God! Chris...

36:41.530 --> 36:43.589
- No! No! No! No!

36:46.500 --> 36:48.491
- Down! Down!

36:55.910 --> 36:58.344
- Chris, wait!

36:59.780 --> 37:03.773
Don't shoot. It's okay...

37:03.820 --> 37:06.618
You're home now. Put the gun
down, Christopher.

37:10.620 --> 37:12.622
- Shoot him, Christopher.

37:17.700 --> 37:20.396
- Christopher...

37:20.430 --> 37:22.261
Please.

37:51.570 --> 37:53.424
- Can I go home now?

37:53.470 --> 37:56.530
- I don't think you're gonna
go home for a long time.

37:56.570 --> 37:58.800
You came here
to kill your family.

37:58.840 --> 38:01.308
That's all
anybody knows.

38:01.340 --> 38:03.672
It may be all that
anyone ever believes.

38:03.710 --> 38:06.679
- I wasn't gonna do it.

38:06.710 --> 38:09.941
- Well, you're gonna have
to talk to a lot_of
people about It.

38:09.980 --> 38:12.710
And those people are gonna try
and help you understand

38:12.750 --> 38:15.457
what you were really
trying to do.

38:18.690 --> 38:21.329
- She told me

38:21.360 --> 38:24.989
that they weren't my family.

38:25.030 --> 38:27.863
That we had to make
our own family.

38:30.040 --> 38:32.008
Do you have a family?

38:32.040 --> 38:35.601
- I don't have any children. No.

38:37.740 --> 38:40.846
- Then you don't know
what it's like.

38:47.050 --> 38:49.553
Can I talk to my mom?

38:49.590 --> 38:51.558
My real mom.

38:51.590 --> 38:54.957
- In a little while.

38:55.000 --> 38:58.868
But first, I need you
to talk to me.

39:04.040 --> 39:06.759
-_As someone who makes such a
bIg deal about common courtesy,

39:06.810 --> 39:09.836
I'm a little taken aback,
slash a lot taken aback,

39:09.880 --> 39:12.747
that you would
take my patient--

39:12.780 --> 39:15.146
my patient, out of the hospital

39:15.180 --> 39:17.774
without my permission.

39:19.420 --> 39:21.854
And I'm not
a profeSSIonal scold,

39:21.890 --> 39:24.882
but don't put me in
this position ever again.

39:26.890 --> 39:28.858
- I'm sorry.

39:28.900 --> 39:30.959
- Rude.

39:31.000 --> 39:32.991
Hannibal,
shockingly rude.

39:33.030 --> 39:34.930
- You have every right
to be upset with me.

39:34.970 --> 39:37.165
I overstepped
my bounds.

39:37.200 --> 39:39.168
- Where is she?

39:39.210 --> 39:41.770
- She's in
the dining room.

39:48.680 --> 39:50.773
And Alana...

39:50.820 --> 39:52.913
you were right.

39:52.950 --> 39:54.918
- Often am.

39:54.960 --> 39:57.053
Have to be more specific.

39:57.090 --> 40:00.856
- She wasn't ready to leave
the hospital when she...

40:00.890 --> 40:04.018
experienced a bit of anxiety,
so I gave her a sedative.

40:04.060 --> 40:06.767
- A sedative?
What did you give her?

40:06.800 --> 40:08.461
- I only gave her
half a Valium, but she may be

40:08.500 --> 40:10.866
a little hazy.

40:13.840 --> 40:16.070
- Hi, Dr. Bloom.

40:16.110 --> 40:18.408
- Hello, Abigail.

40:20.210 --> 40:22.576
You were expecting me?

40:24.150 --> 40:27.540
- Please.

40:31.630 --> 40:33.655
- Are you hungry?

40:33.690 --> 40:36.056
Hannibal made breakfast
for dinner.

40:36.100 --> 40:40.093
- I could eat.

40:44.910 --> 40:46.901
- What is it?

40:51.850 --> 40:54.978
Abigail.

40:55.020 --> 40:58.740
What do you see?

41:01.620 --> 41:04.589
- I see family.

41:12.130 --> 41:14.564
- Hello.

41:27.880 --> 41:31.043
You think it's too late
for us to have kids?

41:40.630 --> 41:42.894
- It is for me.
