Hey. Mr. and Mrs. Silver!

01:20.368 --> 01:22.085
- Grab a booth.
- Thanks.

01:22.340 --> 01:23.779
Uh, whoa, what are you doing?

01:23.804 --> 01:25.188
- I'm not your waitress.
- Yeah, I told you

01:25.212 --> 01:26.320
when we bought this place, Kel,

01:26.344 --> 01:28.137
sometimes you got to
get your hands dirty.

01:28.515 --> 01:30.655
Do you remember when we used
to make out to this song

01:30.680 --> 01:32.951
- underneath the bleachers?
- I do. I do.

01:32.976 --> 01:35.592
Why do you think I sampled
it for that Jay-Z track?

01:38.337 --> 01:39.940
Okay. Oh, hi.

01:40.211 --> 01:41.552
Here you go.

01:43.343 --> 01:44.458
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:44.483 --> 01:46.741
- Watch out, buddy.
- I love it when we're all together.

01:47.791 --> 01:49.648
- Oh, I don't know about that one.
- Hmm.

01:49.673 --> 01:52.044
No, I-I'd like to exchange this egg.

01:52.069 --> 01:53.652
You want to exchange an egg?

01:59.554 --> 02:01.387
♪ And I want ya to know I do it ♪

02:01.412 --> 02:03.672
♪ All 4 love... ♪

02:03.697 --> 02:07.078
Oh, wait, Brenda wanted me
to order her a slice of pie.

02:09.038 --> 02:10.845
I thought Brenda was in London.

02:15.140 --> 02:16.390
Brenda?

02:19.095 --> 02:20.537
Tori, will you shut up!

02:20.562 --> 02:22.562
- We're on an airplane.
- Sorry.

02:23.421 --> 02:24.803
Wait. It's not cheating

02:24.828 --> 02:27.398
if you dream of kissing
your ex-boyfriend, right?

02:27.423 --> 02:28.875
Uh, no.

02:28.900 --> 02:30.631
Just like it's not murder if you dream

02:30.656 --> 02:32.172
- about killing your ex-husband.
- Vegas!

02:32.196 --> 02:34.951
Vegas! Vegas! Vegas!

02:34.976 --> 02:36.320
- What is happening?
- Vegas!

02:36.345 --> 02:38.351
Vegas! Vegas!

02:38.376 --> 02:39.851
Oh, Lord.

02:39.876 --> 02:41.711
Tell me you're not Instagramming that.

02:41.735 --> 02:45.031
Us on our way to our 90210 30th reunion,

02:45.056 --> 02:47.999
and these drunk yahoos
in the back seat? Insta-gold.

02:48.024 --> 02:49.024
Smile.

02:49.049 --> 02:51.062
- You are out of control.
- No.

02:51.087 --> 02:52.427
What I'm out of is money.

02:52.452 --> 02:53.515
This is gonna help.

02:54.032 --> 02:55.820
All these bills.

02:56.610 --> 02:59.820
$842 for Mommy and Me yoga?

02:59.845 --> 03:01.762
Great. I can't do that anymore.

03:01.787 --> 03:02.984
Namaste here.

03:03.009 --> 03:05.109
- Babe, can we talk about this later?
- Oh.

03:05.134 --> 03:07.570
Right. Save it for when
the cameras are rolling.

03:07.595 --> 03:09.117
- Okay.
- That's not what I meant.

03:09.725 --> 03:10.725
Hmm.

03:11.907 --> 03:13.536
All right, guys, let's wrap it up.

03:13.560 --> 03:15.071
I-I thought we were ready to go.

03:15.095 --> 03:17.562
- Wait, no, no, no.
- Why are you leaving?

03:17.587 --> 03:19.921
Guys, excuse me. What's happening?

03:19.946 --> 03:21.531
The show just got canceled.

03:21.556 --> 03:23.507
You've milked your
brand from every angle.

03:23.532 --> 03:25.406
The network says there's no more story.

03:26.447 --> 03:28.656
No more story? Can you believe that?

03:28.681 --> 03:30.273
Stuff just keeps happening to me.

03:30.298 --> 03:32.390
And just when I think
things are slowing down,

03:32.415 --> 03:33.748
boom, I fall on a hibachi.

03:33.773 --> 03:35.515
Oh, I love that about you.

03:35.540 --> 03:37.757
So that's why I have a
meeting set up next week.

03:37.782 --> 03:39.709
I'm gonna sell the
network on another season

03:39.734 --> 03:42.093
of Tori and Nate: Spelling the Beans.

03:42.118 --> 03:43.453
Well, I thought it got canceled.

03:43.719 --> 03:45.609
Yeah, but I need that paycheck.

03:45.634 --> 03:47.375
Mama's got six kids.

03:47.704 --> 03:50.104
Do you know how much college
bribery money I'm gonna need?

03:50.129 --> 03:51.625
Can't Nate get a job?

03:51.650 --> 03:52.758
Hopefully.

03:52.782 --> 03:55.187
He has an audition for an
NHL announcer tomorrow.

03:55.212 --> 03:56.761
I'm just hoping his voice is as good

03:56.786 --> 03:58.285
as his slap shot used to be.

03:58.310 --> 03:59.563
But at least this reunion's gonna

03:59.587 --> 04:01.133
cover our bills for the month.

04:01.390 --> 04:04.084
Excuse me.
Why is there no room on this plane?

04:04.109 --> 04:05.539
It's called coach.

04:05.950 --> 04:08.132
- What is it called?
- Coach.

04:09.064 --> 04:10.640
<i>- Hi, babe.</i>
- Hey.

04:10.665 --> 04:11.889
I don't mean to bug you but

04:11.914 --> 04:15.613
- don't forget that Bryce has that...
- <i>That play date tomorrow, I know.</i>

04:15.638 --> 04:18.507
<i>I got it. Brian, baby,
what are you worried about?</i>

04:18.531 --> 04:20.015
<i>Focus on you this weekend.</i>

04:20.040 --> 04:22.108
<i>It is your time to shine.</i>

04:22.134 --> 04:23.321
<i>Shay.</i>

04:23.346 --> 04:26.085
<i>Five platinum records, nine Grammys,</i>

04:26.110 --> 04:27.867
<i>and nominated for three awards tonight.</i>

04:27.892 --> 04:29.118
<i>- Oh, thank you so much.
- How do you do it?</i>

04:29.142 --> 04:32.232
<i>Oh, my goodness, I couldn't do it
without my incredible husband Brian.</i>

04:32.257 --> 04:34.206
<i>He is my rock.</i>

04:34.231 --> 04:36.982
<i>The best dad on the planet, all of that.</i>

04:36.993 --> 04:38.406
<i>I got this.</i>

04:38.431 --> 04:41.679
Focus on you, babe.
This weekend is all about you.

04:41.704 --> 04:43.680
Please. It's a 90210 event.

04:43.705 --> 04:45.898
You know it's gonna be a
thunderdome of girl drama.

04:45.923 --> 04:47.172
You're not gonna be there by yourself.

04:47.196 --> 04:48.197
Who else is going with you?

04:48.221 --> 04:49.500
<i>Ian's going for sure.</i>

04:49.525 --> 04:51.179
Loves a good convention.

04:51.248 --> 04:54.515
Gives him a chance to meet his fans
and build his brand.

04:54.540 --> 04:56.320
Okay, Ian, honey, I'm posting

04:56.345 --> 04:58.671
that you're selling our book
at the 90210 reunion.

04:58.696 --> 05:00.040
Oh, good. You know what, don't forget

05:00.064 --> 05:02.015
#SweatTogetherGetTogether.

05:02.040 --> 05:03.851
Oh, yes, that's great.

05:03.876 --> 05:06.116
I can't believe I have to do
this without you by my side.

05:08.339 --> 05:09.865
I just thought of a new class:

05:09.890 --> 05:12.468
Fit Fun Flirty Dirty.

05:12.493 --> 05:14.132
How can one person be so smart,

05:14.157 --> 05:16.593
creative, and beautiful
all at the same time?

05:16.848 --> 05:18.273
Aw...

05:18.803 --> 05:20.460
Can't wait to show you off in Vegas.

05:21.796 --> 05:25.117
Don't hate me, but... I can't come.

05:25.398 --> 05:27.156
What? Hold on.

05:27.567 --> 05:30.202
- What? Why not?
- Because...

05:30.562 --> 05:33.663
I'm auditioning for The Real
Housewives of Beverly Hills.

05:35.356 --> 05:36.780
Shut the front door.

05:36.943 --> 05:37.943
Baby!

05:39.257 --> 05:41.475
Don't get too crazy in Vegas.

05:41.500 --> 05:43.328
Don't worry, Gabby's coming.

05:46.253 --> 05:49.117
Oh... Oh, honey, I miss her so much.

05:49.142 --> 05:52.132
Three days old and I leave her.
What was I thinking?

05:56.599 --> 05:58.358
Congratulations, Grandma.

05:58.906 --> 06:00.601
I want to talk to you
about that "G" word.

06:01.077 --> 06:02.077
Yeah.

06:02.102 --> 06:04.296
This is going a little bit fast for me.

06:04.321 --> 06:06.078
So if you don't mind...

06:06.787 --> 06:09.414
I, at least for now,
would like her to call me Gabby.

06:11.765 --> 06:14.764
Yeah, Gabby might be a little confusing

06:14.789 --> 06:16.921
for her because...

06:17.320 --> 06:18.664
meet Gabrielle.

06:22.840 --> 06:24.381
You named her after me?

06:26.156 --> 06:28.906
Oh, thanks, I got to go.
It's the office. Uh, Gabrielle here.

06:28.931 --> 06:30.709
<i>Hey, it's John.
Need you to be impartial.</i>

06:30.734 --> 06:32.335
Impartial? Of course I can be impartial.

06:32.360 --> 06:34.752
That's my duty as president of
the Actors Guild of America.

06:34.777 --> 06:36.781
I got to protect actors
when they make a complaint.

06:36.806 --> 06:37.939
What's going on?

06:40.098 --> 06:41.231
Are you kidding?

06:41.256 --> 06:42.731
Who's the director?

06:42.756 --> 06:44.631
<i>- Guess who.</i>
- Oh...

06:44.656 --> 06:45.937
I'm gonna kill him.

06:46.328 --> 06:48.179
I can't believe you're
making me do this.

06:48.204 --> 06:50.187
Jason, it's my job as your publicist.

06:50.212 --> 06:52.937
- You're my wife.
- Not right now.

06:52.962 --> 06:54.710
This is business.

06:55.187 --> 06:57.281
And you did this to yourself.

07:01.305 --> 07:02.379
Cut it.

07:02.404 --> 07:03.912
Okay, guys, that's a cut.

07:03.937 --> 07:06.742
- Cutting!
- Chaz, buddy,

07:07.695 --> 07:09.478
can you dig a little deeper?

07:09.503 --> 07:11.864
I mean, I-I need you
to make the audience

07:11.889 --> 07:14.648
feel your regret when
you tell Cassidy...

07:14.657 --> 07:15.757
I-I was saving the city.

07:15.782 --> 07:17.351
I-I don't give a crap about Cassidy.

07:17.376 --> 07:19.289
And I don't need acting advice from you.

07:19.314 --> 07:20.531
Just go stand on your mark.

07:20.556 --> 07:22.851
Bro, you were a pinup boy
for horny teenage girls.

07:22.876 --> 07:24.367
Okay, just get over yourself.

07:24.392 --> 07:27.023
All you'll ever be is Brandon Walsh.

07:36.953 --> 07:38.898
No one's gonna want to
finance the indie film

07:38.923 --> 07:41.560
of a rage-filled director who
punches out his lead actors.

07:41.585 --> 07:43.919
Use this reunion as a
chance to remind people

07:43.944 --> 07:46.554
how much they love Jason Priestley.

07:47.054 --> 07:48.701
America's golden boy.

07:48.726 --> 07:50.592
Sexy Brandon Walsh.

07:50.906 --> 07:52.367
Think you can do that for me?

07:54.203 --> 07:55.204
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

07:55.228 --> 07:56.835
- <i>welcome to Las Vegas.</i>
- Oh, thank you.

07:57.664 --> 07:58.664
Ow.

08:00.405 --> 08:02.140
Hey, uh, listen.

08:02.444 --> 08:05.195
Don't say anything about Mark, okay?

08:05.393 --> 08:06.960
I don't need everybody knowing about

08:06.985 --> 08:08.703
failed marriage number three.

08:09.234 --> 08:10.872
I can already hear the clickbait.

08:10.897 --> 08:13.953
"From America's Sweetheart
to Sad Spinster."

08:13.978 --> 08:17.570
Oh, stop, you're gorgeous.
He's an idiot for leaving you.

08:17.904 --> 08:19.104
What the hell was he thinking?

08:20.453 --> 08:22.601
What the hell was I thinking?!

08:22.626 --> 08:24.226
Mom, the drama.

08:24.251 --> 08:26.288
Can't you just throw his
stuff in the garbage?

08:26.313 --> 08:29.117
Yeah, but it's not nearly as satisfying.

08:31.131 --> 08:32.405
Okay.

08:32.431 --> 08:33.895
He said I'm too aggressive.

08:33.919 --> 08:35.812
Makes me want to bash his brains in.

08:35.893 --> 08:37.476
I'm just... I'm not in the right space

08:37.501 --> 08:39.376
to be around all these people.

08:39.592 --> 08:40.921
It's gonna be fine.

08:40.946 --> 08:43.080
Silver lining: Shannen won't be there.

08:43.448 --> 08:44.828
But Jason will.

08:44.853 --> 08:46.412
- I love Jason.
- Of course.

08:46.437 --> 08:47.632
He's America's golden boy.

08:47.657 --> 08:48.657
Ugh, whatever.

08:48.682 --> 08:49.683
Watch your step, please.

08:49.707 --> 08:50.936
Ah, let's go.

08:50.961 --> 08:54.125
Vegas! Vegas! Vegas!

08:54.150 --> 08:55.500
Vegas!

09:07.328 --> 09:10.164
$40 a T-shirt, and we don't see a dime.

09:10.189 --> 09:12.016
No wonder I can't pay my rent.

09:13.535 --> 09:15.582
Ha. Well, we made it.

09:17.005 --> 09:18.211
May I help you?

09:18.672 --> 09:22.071
Yep. Uh, we're checking in
for the reunion panel.

09:22.096 --> 09:23.096
Name?

09:24.321 --> 09:26.227
Jennie. Garth.

09:27.516 --> 09:28.938
Jennie Garth.

09:28.963 --> 09:31.375
Um, I-I'm on the show

09:31.400 --> 09:33.742
that's having the big reunion party.

09:34.953 --> 09:36.211
Kelly Taylor?

09:36.236 --> 09:39.274
So, is the reservation
under Garth or-or Taylor?

09:39.953 --> 09:41.272
I... mm-mm.

09:41.297 --> 09:44.883
My name is Jennie Garth.
I play Kelly Taylor...

09:45.947 --> 09:46.947
... on the show.

09:46.972 --> 09:48.516
- Oh, that's you.
- Yeah.

09:48.541 --> 09:50.164
Oh, you look so much older than her.

09:50.189 --> 09:52.110
Um, if I could just see some I.D.,

09:52.135 --> 09:54.711
I could figure out which name
the reservation is under.

09:57.129 --> 09:58.530
He wants to see my I.D.

09:58.555 --> 10:01.196
Yeah, here's her I.D. right here. Sorry.

10:01.221 --> 10:02.491
She has low blood sugar.

10:02.516 --> 10:04.296
- Okay.
- Come here.

10:04.321 --> 10:05.371
C-Can I talk to you for a second?

10:05.395 --> 10:07.780
Oh, I'm gonna destroy this
place on Trip Advisor.

10:07.805 --> 10:09.985
I get that you're edgy.
I feel edgy, too.

10:10.010 --> 10:12.063
In fact, I didn't think I
was gonna be this nervous.

10:12.088 --> 10:14.422
I am so... nervous.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.610
I haven't seen Brian in almost 20 years.

10:16.635 --> 10:18.072
I'm kind of freaking out a little bit.

10:18.096 --> 10:20.500
Okay, he's married, you're married.

10:20.525 --> 10:21.672
You guys both have kids.

10:21.697 --> 10:24.024
And I understand that,
but we still have a history.

10:24.049 --> 10:25.898
I lost my virginity to him.

10:25.923 --> 10:27.153
On the show.

10:27.178 --> 10:28.894
Life imitates art, remember?

10:28.919 --> 10:31.115
Oh, right. Yeah, okay, just breathe.

10:31.140 --> 10:32.140
Okay.

10:32.165 --> 10:34.325
I feel like I'm sweating so bad.
Do I smell?

10:34.350 --> 10:36.672
Oh, no. Jen, I stink.

10:36.697 --> 10:38.866
- I didn't want to say anything.
- Okay, I got to go to the room.

10:38.890 --> 10:41.242
I'm gonna freshen up and...
Nope, he's right there.

10:43.626 --> 10:44.914
Oh, my God.

10:45.510 --> 10:47.219
- Uh, I'm gonna slip out.
- Oh.

10:47.244 --> 10:48.431
Oh, there's Jason.

10:49.478 --> 10:51.945
- Oh, God, Ian and Gabby.
- Oops.

10:51.970 --> 10:53.399
Yeah!

11:06.279 --> 11:07.279
Well...

11:08.305 --> 11:09.703
this is weird.

11:12.135 --> 11:13.535
Oh, come on, we're all thinking it.

11:13.829 --> 11:15.749
I like that the anniversary
brought us together.

11:15.773 --> 11:17.961
I can't believe that we are all here.

11:18.312 --> 11:20.137
I wish that were true.

11:24.920 --> 11:26.952
Well, it's so great to see all you guys.

11:27.603 --> 11:28.687
Come here, you.

11:29.172 --> 11:30.984
Oh, awesome. The girls.

11:31.822 --> 11:33.789
Give me some of that.
I want some of that.

11:33.814 --> 11:35.914
My wife said Shay killed
it on the red carpet.

11:35.939 --> 11:38.633
Yeah, she is a red carpet assassin.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.726
- Hi, Gab.
- Hey, Gab.

11:42.751 --> 11:44.023
- Hey.
- How are you?

11:44.742 --> 11:46.312
So, I, uh...

11:47.164 --> 11:49.125
I had to hear about this from the guild?

11:49.150 --> 11:51.789
Yeah, it's, um... it's my dialing hand.

11:51.814 --> 11:53.414
Mm, does it hurt?

11:53.635 --> 11:54.635
Yeah.

11:54.660 --> 11:56.140
- Good.
- Oh!

11:56.640 --> 11:58.700
- Really?
- So how's... Jack?

11:59.049 --> 12:00.591
- Mark.
- Mark! How's Mark?

12:00.616 --> 12:02.091
- He's... fine.
- Good.

12:02.116 --> 12:04.051
- Good. Thanks.
- Happy to hear that. So great.

12:04.076 --> 12:05.076
Jen.

12:06.414 --> 12:08.247
You know I'm not a hugger.

12:08.322 --> 12:09.723
So later maybe?

12:10.309 --> 12:11.403
- No.
- No?

12:11.428 --> 12:12.428
Hey, Tor.

12:13.070 --> 12:14.309
Hey!

12:14.334 --> 12:15.880
Hi. Hmm.

12:18.761 --> 12:19.761
Did you see that?

12:19.786 --> 12:21.901
- Yeah.
- After 20 years, "Hey, Tor,"

12:21.926 --> 12:23.130
two words... that's all I get?

12:23.155 --> 12:24.716
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

12:24.741 --> 12:26.216
Oh, my God, it's them!

12:26.241 --> 12:28.059
Oh, it's go time. Come on!

12:29.694 --> 12:31.574
At least she's got my shirt on.

12:34.203 --> 12:35.715
Oh, boy.

12:36.672 --> 12:37.919
All right.

12:39.478 --> 12:41.426
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I'm...

12:41.725 --> 12:45.552
I'm good, I'm fine. I'm just a...
little stressed, that's all.

12:46.305 --> 12:49.466
I haven't done this in, uh...
in 20-plus years, so it's...

12:49.491 --> 12:52.091
I just don't want to
say something stupid,

12:52.116 --> 12:53.299
look like an idiot.

12:57.348 --> 13:00.247
You remember our little
good luck ritual?

13:01.547 --> 13:03.567
Come on. You remember.

13:03.592 --> 13:06.466
The one before big scenes,
we got nervous, we would do?

13:06.860 --> 13:07.860
This one?

13:14.189 --> 13:15.372
That totally works.

13:15.397 --> 13:17.020
It doesn't look very cool, but it works.

13:20.295 --> 13:21.497
Little secret?

13:22.182 --> 13:24.020
I originally started doing that

13:24.045 --> 13:26.763
to do a breath check
before our kissing scenes.

13:27.329 --> 13:28.489
Nice.

13:29.622 --> 13:30.653
Thank you.

13:30.678 --> 13:32.373
<i>- Ladies and gentlemen...</i>
- You got this.

13:32.397 --> 13:33.794
<i>Please find your seats.</i>

13:33.819 --> 13:35.302
<i>The event is about to begin.</i>

13:35.327 --> 13:36.755
Here we go.

13:36.780 --> 13:39.505
Okay, showtime. Let's do it.

13:40.717 --> 13:43.098
Is she gonna do that
teacher clap the whole time?

13:45.413 --> 13:48.364
So, all those make-out scenes...

13:50.858 --> 13:54.184
Did any of the romance spill off camera?

13:54.209 --> 13:55.458
Um...

13:55.483 --> 13:58.434
- there was a little spillage probably.
- Okay.

13:58.459 --> 14:00.036
Yeah, but we don't kiss and tell.

14:00.061 --> 14:01.501
Now you're just teasing us.

14:02.200 --> 14:04.934
Let's turn this over to the audience.
Any questions?

14:04.959 --> 14:06.606
Yeah. Right over there. Go ahead.

14:06.631 --> 14:10.661
Andrea Zuckerman was my favorite
character on TV in the '90s.

14:11.310 --> 14:13.177
What did you like most
about playing Andrea?

14:13.202 --> 14:15.559
I... You know what? Andrea was strong

14:15.584 --> 14:19.138
and intelligent,
and she stayed true to herself,

14:19.163 --> 14:21.075
so I... I guess I am trying

14:21.100 --> 14:23.098
to aspire to that in
my own life, as well.

14:23.123 --> 14:24.395
- Aw...
- Thank you.

14:24.420 --> 14:25.622
Next question.

14:25.647 --> 14:26.825
Hi, Brian.

14:26.850 --> 14:29.223
- Hi.
- Um, I was just wondering.

14:29.248 --> 14:31.638
Do you know when Shay's
new album is gonna drop?

14:32.727 --> 14:36.400
Um, I-I try not to get
involved in her music career,

14:36.425 --> 14:38.505
but I am her number one fan.

14:38.530 --> 14:39.856
Aw...

14:39.881 --> 14:41.559
Any other questions?

14:41.584 --> 14:43.723
That do not involve my wife?

14:44.824 --> 14:45.942
Thought so.

14:45.967 --> 14:47.403
Which one of you guys was

14:47.428 --> 14:49.661
least like your character on 90210?

14:49.686 --> 14:52.404
Oh, that kid over there. Right there.

14:52.429 --> 14:53.445
Me?!

14:53.470 --> 14:54.877
Yes, you.

14:54.902 --> 14:57.966
Brandon Walsh was squeaky clean,
but this guy, I mean...

14:57.991 --> 14:59.572
he's a little hotheaded.

14:59.597 --> 15:01.316
Oh, right.

15:01.341 --> 15:03.005
That. Okay, yes, I might have

15:03.030 --> 15:05.559
lost my temper on set, I'll admit it.

15:05.584 --> 15:08.364
Violence is never the answer,
but suffice it to say,

15:08.389 --> 15:10.553
I always stick up for the little guy.

15:11.427 --> 15:12.997
Yeah, himself.

15:14.561 --> 15:15.763
Question for Brian.

15:15.788 --> 15:18.364
Uh, I've been watching
the show with my mother.

15:18.389 --> 15:21.553
Your character was always
kind of an outsider.

15:21.578 --> 15:22.578
Yes.

15:22.751 --> 15:24.130
Were you that way in real life?

15:24.155 --> 15:25.155
Yes.

15:25.413 --> 15:26.661
Still am. Still am.

15:26.686 --> 15:28.177
I have a wife and three daughters,

15:28.202 --> 15:30.559
so the chances are I'm-I'm
gonna be an outsider

15:30.584 --> 15:32.161
- for, uh, quite some time.
- Oh.

15:33.248 --> 15:35.458
You know, I think Brian would
agree that being married

15:35.483 --> 15:37.614
to a brilliant woman is really exciting.

15:37.639 --> 15:39.481
I thank my lucky stars every day

15:39.506 --> 15:41.841
that I found my soul mate Stacey.

15:41.866 --> 15:44.411
She's developed this brand
that is just incredible.

15:44.436 --> 15:46.903
In fact, people, she's just
come out with a book.

15:46.928 --> 15:48.029
She and I.

15:48.811 --> 15:51.934
If you haven't seen it,
you really all need to pick it up.

15:51.959 --> 15:54.692
#SweatTogetherGetTogether.

15:54.717 --> 15:56.380
Hi. My question's for Jennie.

15:56.405 --> 15:58.083
Um, whose romantic life

15:58.108 --> 15:59.638
has had more ups and downs...

15:59.663 --> 16:00.919
Yours or Kelly's?

16:00.944 --> 16:03.552
Well... we've both been burned.

16:04.920 --> 16:06.661
And I just want to say...

16:06.686 --> 16:10.130
I'm so sorry to hear
about you and your husband.

16:10.710 --> 16:11.873
- Excuse me?
- I just heard

16:11.898 --> 16:13.973
on TMZ that he's filing for divorce?

16:17.577 --> 16:19.536
You know what? Um,

16:19.561 --> 16:23.531
Jen's a really private person,
and we should all respect that.

16:24.036 --> 16:25.857
But me... I'm an open book,

16:25.868 --> 16:27.731
so you guys can ask
me whatever you want.

16:29.077 --> 16:32.475
I just want to ask a question
I think we all want to know.

16:32.500 --> 16:35.287
Do any of you know what the
heck Shannen's up to these days?

16:35.312 --> 16:36.530
Have you talked to her?

16:36.815 --> 16:38.054
I haven't spoke to her in a while.

16:38.078 --> 16:39.835
- No, me neither.
- Nope. No.

16:40.037 --> 16:41.468
All right, we are in luck

16:41.493 --> 16:43.031
because, as we speak,

16:43.056 --> 16:46.882
a very special person is
live-streaming on Instagram.

16:46.907 --> 16:48.085
Should we check in?

16:48.475 --> 16:49.562
It's Shannen!

16:56.734 --> 16:57.937
Surprise.

17:07.371 --> 17:10.592
<i>And so one of our rangers
found this little guy.</i>

17:10.617 --> 17:11.617
Aw...

17:14.007 --> 17:16.585
<i>He was all alone, starving,</i>

17:16.609 --> 17:18.470
<i>his mother killed by poachers.</i>

17:19.663 --> 17:22.279
<i>But never fear, you guys,</i>

17:22.304 --> 17:24.788
<i>'cause he's here with me now,
and when he's ready,</i>

17:24.813 --> 17:26.694
<i>we're gonna release him
back out into the wild.</i>

17:26.720 --> 17:29.354
Aw!

17:29.804 --> 17:32.693
<i>Donations really help.
You can send those to:</i>

17:32.718 --> 17:34.435
<i>PawsitivelyShannen.org.</i>

17:34.460 --> 17:36.921
<i>That's "paw"... P-A-W.</i>

17:36.946 --> 17:38.968
- Aw!
<i>- I thank you.</i>

17:39.412 --> 17:40.915
<i>The tigers thank you.</i>

17:41.744 --> 17:42.830
<i>Bye.</i>

17:44.974 --> 17:47.406
<i>Bye, guys, love you.</i>

17:53.035 --> 17:54.035
<i>Bye.</i>

17:55.828 --> 17:58.009
Well, that was a surprise.

17:58.034 --> 18:00.515
Hmm. What? That Shannen's
moved on with her life

18:00.540 --> 18:03.297
and is saving the world,
or that my marriage ended?

18:03.322 --> 18:05.133
'Cause either way... whoo-hoo!

18:05.572 --> 18:06.906
I feel like a fool.

18:06.931 --> 18:09.291
We need to change our flight.
I can't stay here tonight.

18:10.356 --> 18:13.858
Uh, I-I have a... plane.

18:13.883 --> 18:15.477
- Oh, yeah.
- It'll-it'll be ready to go

18:15.501 --> 18:16.703
in, like, four hours.

18:16.728 --> 18:18.438
Fully-stocked bar, tons of seats.

18:18.463 --> 18:19.507
Great.

18:19.532 --> 18:21.788
But I can't wait four hours for a drink.

18:27.811 --> 18:30.373
Oh, I know, isn't she perfect?
Look at her chin.

18:30.398 --> 18:32.178
Between complete adoration

18:32.203 --> 18:34.060
and then utter shock that
I'm a grandmother, okay?

18:34.084 --> 18:35.898
Kill me now 'cause I cannot
believe I'm a grandma.

18:35.922 --> 18:38.062
- I can't believe you're a grandma.
- I know, me either.

18:38.086 --> 18:40.037
Well, you did it the right way,

18:40.062 --> 18:42.686
'cause you had your kids early
and now you can enjoy life.

18:42.711 --> 18:44.270
Me... I did it the opposite way.

18:44.295 --> 18:45.381
Here's my youngest three.

18:45.406 --> 18:47.215
Oh, Tori.

18:49.511 --> 18:51.562
What about you, Jay...
you and Camille gonna have a family?

18:51.586 --> 18:54.324
Uh, we tried a while ago,
but work got crazy,

18:54.349 --> 18:56.090
and we decided not to have kids.

18:56.115 --> 18:58.853
Guess my indie film
will have to be my baby.

18:58.878 --> 19:01.095
No dirty diapers but
lots of whiny actors.

19:01.534 --> 19:02.879
I feel for you, Jay.

19:02.904 --> 19:04.950
I can't wait to have kids with Stacey.

19:05.350 --> 19:07.483
She's just younger, and she wants
to develop her career first.

19:07.507 --> 19:09.967
And marriage is compromise, right?

19:09.992 --> 19:12.356
But I'm real proud of her
for leading with this.

19:12.381 --> 19:14.926
Check this out. Ka-pow-pow! Bam!

19:14.951 --> 19:16.717
- Oh.
- Right?

19:16.742 --> 19:18.256
Hey, if you got it, flaunt it.

19:18.281 --> 19:19.678
It doesn't bother you at all

19:19.703 --> 19:21.957
to have your wife up
on a giant billboard

19:21.982 --> 19:24.379
with all that spray-tanned flesh?

19:24.404 --> 19:26.309
Look, we got a great
relationship, all right?

19:26.334 --> 19:27.871
It's like the perfect marriage.

19:27.896 --> 19:30.451
I always know she's coming home
to me, so what's the big deal?

19:34.281 --> 19:35.921
Yeah, I'm gonna need
another one of these.

19:41.874 --> 19:43.051
Hey, cut it out.

19:43.076 --> 19:44.325
Why don't you come in?

19:44.350 --> 19:45.700
Hmm, maybe.

19:45.725 --> 19:47.139
Why don't you make me?

19:48.568 --> 19:49.989
- You should.
- Hi.

19:50.014 --> 19:51.107
- Hi.
- She's with me.

19:51.131 --> 19:53.059
- No, I'm not.
- Can I take you for a second?

19:53.084 --> 19:55.106
- Girl talk.
- I'll be right back.

19:55.777 --> 19:57.100
What are you doing?

19:57.125 --> 20:00.045
I'm gonna have a roll in the
hay with that hot pig farmer.

20:00.070 --> 20:01.892
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

20:01.917 --> 20:03.957
They're a special breed of heritage pigs

20:03.993 --> 20:05.576
that he raises humanely.

20:05.587 --> 20:07.231
It's a premium product.

20:07.256 --> 20:08.474
- But you're a vegan.
- Mm.

20:08.498 --> 20:09.575
- Not today.
- Okay,

20:09.600 --> 20:11.982
look, just come hang out with us,
we'll have another drink.

20:12.007 --> 20:13.543
- Hey, look at me.
- Yeah.

20:13.568 --> 20:16.989
Ian Ziering has, like,
the perfect marriage.

20:17.014 --> 20:20.215
I'm 0 for 3. I need to,
at the very least,

20:20.240 --> 20:22.404
know that I can get a
pig farmer if I want to.

20:22.429 --> 20:24.271
- Okay?
- Wait...

20:25.151 --> 20:26.326
Okay.

20:26.351 --> 20:27.856
- I'm back.
- You're back.

20:27.881 --> 20:28.881
Yeah.

20:35.452 --> 20:36.783
- Hi, babe.
<i>- Hey.</i>

20:36.808 --> 20:38.169
<i>Guess who got the job offer.</i>

20:38.725 --> 20:40.069
No way.

20:40.094 --> 20:41.455
Tell me everything.

20:41.480 --> 20:43.569
When does it start? What's your pay?

20:43.698 --> 20:45.960
<i>Uh, I don't know. I-I didn't take it.</i>

20:45.985 --> 20:47.962
What? Why, babe?

20:47.987 --> 20:49.954
<i>Babe, it's a local
network affiliate job.</i>

20:49.965 --> 20:51.789
That's like being stuck in the minors

20:51.814 --> 20:53.983
when you know you're
destined for the big leagues.

20:54.695 --> 20:55.874
Yeah.

21:00.944 --> 21:02.976
Babe, I got to go. I'll call you back.

21:03.001 --> 21:04.672
Okay. I love you.

21:05.995 --> 21:07.599
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:07.624 --> 21:09.725
- Family stuff?
- Yes.

21:10.194 --> 21:12.052
- How's it going?
- Awesome.

21:12.077 --> 21:13.529
Shay's, uh...

21:13.554 --> 21:14.693
Shay's got it all covered.

21:14.718 --> 21:16.450
Kids are having a great time.
Apparently,

21:16.474 --> 21:19.616
she had to bribe Bryce with
backstage passes to BTS

21:19.641 --> 21:20.898
just to say hi to me.

21:21.354 --> 21:22.733
Yeah. Felt really good.

21:22.758 --> 21:25.468
Well, just be happy she's
holding down the fort.

21:25.811 --> 21:27.874
My husband's not holding down anything.

21:28.357 --> 21:30.082
Not even a job.

21:31.875 --> 21:33.475
- Do you want to do shots?
- Yes, please.

21:36.157 --> 21:39.639
Oh. 90210 fan and bartender.

21:39.664 --> 21:41.530
A true Renaissance woman.

21:42.406 --> 21:43.812
Now you're flattering me.

21:45.015 --> 21:46.413
Oh, that looks good.

21:48.305 --> 21:49.632
Now it's yours.

21:49.921 --> 21:51.307
Thank you.

21:51.765 --> 21:53.147
Cheers.

21:53.884 --> 21:55.155
Mmm.

21:57.225 --> 21:59.505
- I have to come clean about something.
- Mm.

21:59.530 --> 22:02.860
Andrea Zuckerman wasn't
just my favorite character.

22:02.871 --> 22:04.835
She was also my first crush.

22:06.500 --> 22:08.501
Are you surprised? I mean,

22:08.526 --> 22:10.622
the Suze Orman blazers,

22:10.647 --> 22:11.888
the pantsuits.

22:11.913 --> 22:13.474
Total sapphic symbols, no?

22:13.499 --> 22:15.266
Yeah, well,
it was network TV in the '90s,

22:15.291 --> 22:17.608
and there was no way they were
gonna let Andrea go there.

22:18.082 --> 22:19.624
What about Gabrielle?

22:20.788 --> 22:24.157
Have you ever let yourself go there?

22:27.759 --> 22:29.648
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

22:33.865 --> 22:34.865
Mmm.

22:35.798 --> 22:38.093
I have a question for you,

22:38.118 --> 22:39.313
Brian Austin Green.

22:39.338 --> 22:40.913
Is it about my wife?

22:40.938 --> 22:42.576
- Nope.
- All right.

22:42.601 --> 22:45.602
So, you are a great stay-at-home dad,

22:46.399 --> 22:48.752
but do you ever miss the spotlight?

22:48.777 --> 22:50.819
Mm...

22:50.844 --> 22:53.461
I don't know.
Even if I did, nobody misses me.

22:55.393 --> 22:56.680
That's not true.

22:57.821 --> 22:59.218
I've missed you.

22:59.634 --> 23:00.634
Mmm...

23:04.274 --> 23:05.586
- Here you are, sir.
- Thanks.

23:19.948 --> 23:21.188
Great.

23:21.688 --> 23:23.485
Love you, too, honey.

23:35.166 --> 23:37.962
You know, it's so crazy,
I just got the strongest craving

23:37.987 --> 23:39.632
for bacon.

23:39.830 --> 23:41.792
You know, it's not just
for breakfast anymore.

23:41.803 --> 23:44.416
Some people call it meat candy.

23:46.382 --> 23:48.716
Well, I do have a sweet tooth.

23:49.401 --> 23:50.782
Mmm.

23:50.807 --> 23:52.260
Mm-hmm.

23:53.257 --> 23:55.775
How about we go somewhere
we can be alone, Kelly?

23:58.106 --> 23:59.203
What's wrong?

23:59.228 --> 24:00.345
Nope.

24:02.463 --> 24:05.494
It's Jennie, pig farmer.

24:17.564 --> 24:18.564
Great.

24:19.384 --> 24:20.966
Hey, take a seat.

24:23.216 --> 24:24.335
I know you're not a hugger,

24:24.346 --> 24:27.977
but... you look like you could use one.

24:30.818 --> 24:31.876
Thanks.

24:31.901 --> 24:33.076
Yeah.

24:33.574 --> 24:34.990
Cheers.

24:40.990 --> 24:42.732
How the hell did we end up here?

24:43.573 --> 24:46.848
Well, my odyssey began with
an audition at The Manor.

24:49.146 --> 24:51.028
Do you ever wonder what
our lives would be like

24:51.039 --> 24:52.679
if we hadn't done that show?

24:54.387 --> 24:55.966
Every single day.

25:02.849 --> 25:04.708
People see me and,

25:04.719 --> 25:08.119
they think I'm Kelly Taylor
or I'm no one.

25:09.541 --> 25:11.595
They have no idea who I really am.

25:17.640 --> 25:19.259
I know who you really are.

25:20.220 --> 25:21.618
You're Jennie Garth.

25:21.978 --> 25:24.228
The smart, fierce woman
I went to work with

25:24.239 --> 25:26.117
every day for ten years.

25:26.142 --> 25:28.232
- You were there for eight.
- Technically,

25:28.243 --> 25:30.411
I left four episodes
into the ninth season,

25:30.436 --> 25:31.771
but that's not the point.

25:32.747 --> 25:35.441
Jen, not to objectify you,
because I know you hate that...

25:35.466 --> 25:38.085
- You do?
- Yeah. I do.

25:41.099 --> 25:42.649
But I see you.

25:44.244 --> 25:45.627
All of you.

25:54.102 --> 25:55.767
- Where's your...?
- It's on the side.

25:55.792 --> 25:57.155
I got it, I got it.

25:58.876 --> 26:00.024
Right there.

26:07.806 --> 26:09.407
Wow.

26:10.595 --> 26:12.009
Kill me now.

26:13.397 --> 26:16.126
And, for the record,
I was gonna say something nice.

26:16.470 --> 26:19.554
Exactly what is it about
me that bugs you so much?

26:20.062 --> 26:21.063
There are plenty of people

26:21.087 --> 26:22.626
who think I'm not so bad.

26:22.651 --> 26:25.517
That. That right there.

26:28.185 --> 26:29.715
You always thought you could just

26:29.740 --> 26:31.754
charm your way out of everything.

26:31.779 --> 26:34.767
Well... it's not that
I just thought it, I mean,

26:34.792 --> 26:37.150
- I actually did.
- Oh, I know.

26:37.175 --> 26:38.635
The more partying and womanizing

26:38.660 --> 26:40.606
you did, the more people loved you. Me?

26:40.631 --> 26:43.299
If I wore the wrong nail polish color,
I was a slut.

26:43.324 --> 26:44.707
Nothing's changed since.

26:44.732 --> 26:47.215
Yeah, okay, Jennie, I get it.

26:47.240 --> 26:49.330
Double standard. That sucks.

26:49.355 --> 26:50.730
But not my fault.

26:51.160 --> 26:54.016
Look, there have been
consequences for me, too.

26:55.066 --> 26:57.291
I'm stuck being a TV director.

26:57.316 --> 26:59.525
I can't get my indie feature financed.

26:59.550 --> 27:02.018
But all of that is for
stuff you actually did.

27:02.043 --> 27:03.729
Oh, yeah, that may be true.

27:03.754 --> 27:06.049
Something my wife
constantly reminds me of.

27:06.074 --> 27:08.549
Your wife? The one you just cheated on?

27:08.574 --> 27:10.511
Which you'll probably
get away with, too.

27:11.160 --> 27:12.503
Yeah, you're probably right.

27:14.037 --> 27:15.800
Plane's leaving soon.

27:17.708 --> 27:18.941
Boomerang, Boomerang!

27:18.966 --> 27:20.690
On three.

27:22.213 --> 27:24.331
- Whenever you're ready.
- Thought you said "on three".

27:24.355 --> 27:25.957
Hmm. Want to split it?

27:26.102 --> 27:27.355
No.

27:27.380 --> 27:29.707
Oh, thank God.
I didn't really mean that.

27:30.367 --> 27:32.066
I think they went down here.

27:32.613 --> 27:35.419
- Let me see, okay, who's here?
- What? Look at that.

27:35.444 --> 27:37.361
I can't even pay my bills,

27:37.372 --> 27:41.057
and yet that show is still
cashing in on our faces.

27:41.082 --> 27:42.377
- Hi.
- I don't understand.

27:42.401 --> 27:43.796
I mean, your dad produced the show.

27:43.820 --> 27:46.288
How did, how did you not get any money?

27:46.605 --> 27:48.159
Welcome to my life.

27:51.337 --> 27:53.712
Okay. Now I'm on a dog.

27:57.300 --> 27:58.472
Where are you going?

27:59.371 --> 28:02.175
Hold on! Wait! Wait!

28:02.465 --> 28:04.054
That's my face!

28:04.065 --> 28:05.893
I want compensation.

28:05.918 --> 28:09.332
I'll sue you! And your little dog, too.

28:10.327 --> 28:11.593
Forget it.

28:13.199 --> 28:14.871
Jen! Ian!

28:15.563 --> 28:17.105
Jen!

28:19.160 --> 28:20.566
That's my dress.

28:20.591 --> 28:22.338
That's my dress!

28:22.363 --> 28:25.534
Hey, you guys! Jen, Jen, it's my dress!

28:25.559 --> 28:27.972
Come on! Come on!

28:31.000 --> 28:32.041
No.

28:33.400 --> 28:35.238
- Tori.
- What are you doing?

28:35.263 --> 28:38.144
Are you all gonna stand there?
Why aren't you helping me?

28:38.169 --> 28:40.434
Well, you seem a little
crazy right now, Tor.

28:40.459 --> 28:42.936
'Cause this, this is my dress.

28:42.961 --> 28:45.763
And you, Bri, why aren't you helping me?

28:45.773 --> 28:48.605
I helped you earlier
when you were nervous.

28:48.630 --> 28:51.675
- And you popped my cherry.
- Okay...

28:51.700 --> 28:53.940
Settle down, it was only on a TV show.

28:55.082 --> 28:56.986
And you, Calendar Girl.

28:57.011 --> 28:59.057
I told my dad to cast you.

28:59.082 --> 29:01.854
If it wasn't for me,
you'd be tapping maple syrup

29:01.879 --> 29:03.911
- and chasing mooses.
- All right, let's go.

29:03.935 --> 29:06.216
- So you guys get your asses over here.
- All right, all right.

29:06.240 --> 29:08.462
- Come on! Oh, hi.
- All right, stop screaming.

29:08.487 --> 29:11.379
Excuse me, can you take this?
Can you go live? Thank you.

29:11.605 --> 29:13.261
This is locked.

29:17.571 --> 29:18.689
Would you...

29:18.714 --> 29:20.973
fulfill a teenage fantasy of mine?

29:23.441 --> 29:24.968
That depends.

29:29.818 --> 29:30.818
Help!

29:30.843 --> 29:32.487
Tori, this is locked.
You're not getting in there.

29:32.511 --> 29:33.846
You'd have to break it.

29:33.871 --> 29:35.963
- Guys, guys.
- Oh.

29:35.988 --> 29:37.669
- No, I was kidding...
- Stand back.

29:37.694 --> 29:39.854
- Tori, I was kidding, I was kidding!
- No, no, no, no!

29:39.983 --> 29:41.279
Oh...!

29:42.004 --> 29:43.004
Did you get that?

29:43.029 --> 29:44.665
- Are you crazy?
- God.

29:45.721 --> 29:47.393
Oh, hey, uh...

29:47.824 --> 29:48.824
I have to go.

29:48.849 --> 29:51.171
I left the,
I left the kids unsupervised.

29:51.506 --> 29:52.506
Okay.

29:52.531 --> 29:54.200
Just know it's never too late.

29:57.494 --> 29:59.231
- Unzip it.
- I can't get it off!

29:59.255 --> 30:00.590
What is going on here?

30:00.615 --> 30:01.816
I can't take you anywhere!

30:01.841 --> 30:03.178
- What is happening?
- Oh, boy, here comes security.

30:03.202 --> 30:04.686
- Stop right there!
- Oh, oh, oh, oh.

30:04.710 --> 30:05.785
Time to go, people.

30:05.810 --> 30:07.536
Ooh, that was oddly satisfying.

30:07.561 --> 30:10.667
- I lost my wallet. I lost my wallet.
- Miss, you can't take that!

30:10.692 --> 30:11.997
It doesn't seem very smart

30:12.022 --> 30:14.888
for me to leave my
wallet at a crime scene.

30:14.913 --> 30:16.818
Ma'am, return that right away.

30:18.357 --> 30:19.857
And it is her dress.

30:20.535 --> 30:21.535
Come on, come on.

30:22.153 --> 30:23.418
Do you know her?

30:23.443 --> 30:24.443
Sir.

30:24.707 --> 30:25.707
Sir...

30:25.732 --> 30:27.466
- Jen!
- What?

30:27.491 --> 30:29.724
Oh, Lord, she put it on.

30:29.749 --> 30:32.356
- Too small in here for that thing.
- Look at me now, bitches.

30:32.817 --> 30:33.911
Look, you guys.

30:33.936 --> 30:35.341
- Oh, yeah.
- Can you believe this?

30:35.366 --> 30:37.560
- No, can't believe it.
- I know.

30:37.585 --> 30:39.769
I'm the same exact dress
size I was in high school.

30:39.794 --> 30:41.605
- Thanks to Spanx.
- Three pairs.

30:41.630 --> 30:43.247
- But I got 'em up.
- Nice work.

30:43.677 --> 30:45.730
You guys, I know I'm a little
tipsy... shut up,

30:45.755 --> 30:48.121
- don't say a word.
- Okay, you spit in my eye.

30:48.146 --> 30:49.965
This is not the alcohol speaking.

30:49.990 --> 30:51.690
I just want you to know I forgot

30:51.715 --> 30:54.082
how much I love all of us together.

30:54.107 --> 30:55.559
That was fun, wasn't it?

30:55.570 --> 30:57.115
- That was fun, right?
- It was fun.

30:57.140 --> 30:59.396
- So much fun. So much fun.
- It was so much fun.

30:59.421 --> 31:01.675
- And I got our dress back.
- Come on.

31:01.700 --> 31:03.409
Uh, that's not our dress.

31:03.434 --> 31:04.622
Yeah, it is.

31:04.771 --> 31:07.372
This dress belongs to all of us.

31:07.397 --> 31:09.863
Because this symbolizes everything

31:09.888 --> 31:11.630
that we created together.

31:12.607 --> 31:13.825
You...

31:14.599 --> 31:18.067
and you and you

31:18.482 --> 31:20.091
- and you.
- Thanks.

31:21.286 --> 31:23.308
- And you.
- I'm down here, Tor.

31:23.333 --> 31:25.318
Oh, sorry. And you.

31:25.343 --> 31:26.919
- Okay.
- Mwah.

31:26.944 --> 31:29.661
And me and Shannen and Luke.

31:33.372 --> 31:36.661
Well, we're not all
gonna be here forever.

31:37.489 --> 31:40.466
But we made something that will be.

31:43.302 --> 31:45.021
- To Luke.
- To Luke.

31:45.954 --> 31:47.429
I love you guys.

31:50.210 --> 31:51.405
Great story.

31:52.276 --> 31:53.617
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

31:53.628 --> 31:55.443
- Watch that dress.
- Sorry.

31:55.468 --> 31:57.099
This is insane.

31:57.124 --> 31:59.456
- I can't get it off...
- Oh, look, it's Stacey

31:59.467 --> 32:01.070
- FaceTiming Ian.
- Oh, bring it over here.

32:01.094 --> 32:02.261
I want to say hi to her.

32:02.286 --> 32:03.508
Come on, I can't...
I don't see anything.

32:03.532 --> 32:05.281
- Hi.
- Hey, uh, Tori,

32:05.306 --> 32:06.591
you have to hit "answer."

32:06.616 --> 32:08.216
- Swipe it. A-Answer.
- Oh, right, right.

32:08.428 --> 32:09.749
- Hey.
- Ooh.

32:11.146 --> 32:12.146
Okay.

32:12.171 --> 32:13.225
Oh, my God.

32:14.450 --> 32:15.858
- Oh, my God.
- I don't want it...

32:15.883 --> 32:18.003
This is so wrong.
I don't want to see that.

32:18.176 --> 32:19.358
Push "mute."

32:21.264 --> 32:22.288
Hey...

32:23.515 --> 32:24.811
Is that my phone?

32:24.952 --> 32:25.952
Mm-hmm.

32:32.316 --> 32:33.991
- Z...
- Don't. No, don't.

32:34.671 --> 32:35.671
I'm sorry, bud.

32:35.696 --> 32:37.338
- I don't need your pity.
- It's not pity.

32:37.362 --> 32:38.960
We, uh, we feel bad.

32:39.960 --> 32:41.507
Want to feel bad about something,

32:41.850 --> 32:43.341
feel bad about your nuts.

32:43.366 --> 32:44.437
The ones your wife keeps in her purse.

32:44.461 --> 32:46.139
Oh, come on, you guys, stop, all right?

32:46.164 --> 32:47.609
We don't want to say
anything we're gonna regret.

32:47.633 --> 32:49.309
Gabby, why do you always
feel the need to comment

32:49.333 --> 32:51.051
on something that doesn't concern you?

32:51.076 --> 32:52.304
- Really? Really, Ian?
- Okay, Ian, Ian, Ian,

32:52.328 --> 32:53.329
- you just need to calm down.
- Is that what you're gonna say?

32:53.353 --> 32:54.890
Oh, Jennie, you're gonna
give me marital advice?

32:54.914 --> 32:56.507
- I don't think so.
- Oh, my God.

32:56.532 --> 32:59.542
Hey, Ian, I get it, this sucks,
but don't take it out on us.

32:59.567 --> 33:01.312
Oh, you're right, I should just
go punch somebody in the face.

33:01.336 --> 33:02.615
That's the way to handle it, right, Jay?

33:02.639 --> 33:04.507
Hey. That was a workplace dispute.

33:04.532 --> 33:06.418
- These things happen.
- You guys, stop fighting.

33:06.442 --> 33:07.733
We're all mature adults here.

33:07.758 --> 33:09.538
Says the woman wearing
a stolen hoop skirt.

33:09.563 --> 33:12.560
Uh, excuse me. I am entitled
to what belongs to me.

33:12.585 --> 33:13.960
I have six mouths to feed.

33:13.985 --> 33:16.001
How could you grow up with
every advantage in life

33:16.026 --> 33:18.069
and still struggle to support your kids?

33:18.094 --> 33:19.827
It's mind-boggling to me.

33:19.852 --> 33:21.993
Okay, it's not Tor's fault

33:22.018 --> 33:23.693
that she lacks basic life skills.

33:23.718 --> 33:25.200
I mean, she's not normal.

33:25.225 --> 33:26.812
She can't function in
a normal environment.

33:26.836 --> 33:29.460
It's like letting a zoo
animal out into the wild.

33:29.870 --> 33:30.928
Really?

33:32.952 --> 33:35.046
- Well, I was sticking up for you.
- Well, stop.

33:35.071 --> 33:36.359
<i>Please prepare the cabin for landing.</i>

33:36.383 --> 33:37.929
- Well, now we're landing.
- Got to get out of here.

33:37.953 --> 33:40.005
Yeah, we've spent enough time together.

33:40.030 --> 33:41.202
Yeah, we did.

33:41.227 --> 33:42.585
Enough is enough.

33:42.857 --> 33:45.303
Hey, what are those lights down there?
The paparazzi?

33:47.319 --> 33:49.616
Oh, no, that's not paparazzi.

33:55.994 --> 33:58.514
<i>Breaking news. The cast of 90210</i>

33:58.539 --> 34:00.896
<i>has been arrested for
live-streaming the destruction</i>

34:00.921 --> 34:03.263
<i>of private property and grand larceny,</i>

34:03.288 --> 34:06.349
<i>and then transporting
the stolen goods across state lines.</i>

34:06.733 --> 34:10.436
"9021Ohhh Daddy!"

34:12.536 --> 34:15.513
Yeah. I, uh, I have
no idea what that is.

34:15.538 --> 34:16.991
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm.

34:18.326 --> 34:19.795
Why, are you mad at me?

34:20.303 --> 34:21.733
I'm mad hot...

34:22.382 --> 34:25.170
for a sexy daddy that belongs to me.

34:28.783 --> 34:30.835
- I love you.
- I love you.

34:36.230 --> 34:37.850
- Whoops.
- Oh.

34:43.186 --> 34:44.186
Hey.

34:44.944 --> 34:47.280
My sexy jailbird.

34:48.725 --> 34:49.725
I missed you.

34:49.750 --> 34:50.788
Hi, baby.

34:54.322 --> 34:55.621
You okay?

34:55.647 --> 34:58.832
Yeah. Just a long night of fighting off
the sweetheart of Cellblock C.

35:00.195 --> 35:01.278
How was your audition?

35:01.303 --> 35:04.109
Oh, great. But so exhausting.

35:04.134 --> 35:05.928
After that I pretty much stayed in bed.

35:06.748 --> 35:08.607
Well, hope you had a good time.

35:19.881 --> 35:22.053
Oh, yeah.

35:23.372 --> 35:24.373
Well, would you look at that?

35:24.397 --> 35:26.121
Behind bars, just like her grammy.

35:29.050 --> 35:32.889
Gab... honey, you okay?

35:35.382 --> 35:37.259
Yeah, I'm fine. You know, I...

35:38.907 --> 35:41.520
I did something new this weekend.

35:47.727 --> 35:49.844
I never spent the night in
the clink before.

35:54.149 --> 35:55.734
You guys are everywhere.

35:55.759 --> 35:57.194
This one site even dubbed you guys

35:57.204 --> 36:01.031
"Ocean's 90210." Which I can spin.

36:14.470 --> 36:16.899
Hey, uh, Cam.

36:18.921 --> 36:20.704
There's something I need to tell you.

36:26.312 --> 36:28.204
Well, there's something
I need to tell you, too.

36:29.868 --> 36:30.868
I just...

36:31.431 --> 36:33.751
I think we both know
what the problem is here.

36:34.126 --> 36:35.228
I mean, we have barely been

36:35.253 --> 36:37.556
in the same city for
the last two months.

36:39.811 --> 36:41.446
And I think I have a solution.

36:46.822 --> 36:48.214
I'm pregnant.

36:51.024 --> 36:52.220
You're what?

36:53.423 --> 36:54.735
- I thought... I thought...
- I know.

36:54.759 --> 36:57.012
But... it happened.

37:03.087 --> 37:04.087
Uh...

37:07.524 --> 37:08.743
So, what do you,

37:09.017 --> 37:10.712
what do you mix the glitter with?

37:12.782 --> 37:13.898
Yeah.

37:13.923 --> 37:15.306
Now you got to sit down.

37:36.548 --> 37:38.114
<i>Jeff Gerber's office.</i>

37:38.712 --> 37:39.985
<i>This is Jeff.</i>

37:40.010 --> 37:41.540
Hey, Jeff, it's Brian.

37:41.565 --> 37:43.446
I think I'm ready to get back to work.

37:47.899 --> 37:49.281
Brian Austin Green.

37:49.306 --> 37:50.476
<i>Brian...</i>

37:50.501 --> 37:51.946
Hey, how's it going?

37:52.626 --> 37:55.648
Uh... I know it's been a while.

37:55.673 --> 37:56.673
Sorry.

37:57.328 --> 38:02.141
Uh, yeah, any, uh...
any guest spots that I could do?

38:14.633 --> 38:16.649
Bail is expensive.

38:16.977 --> 38:19.217
Please tell me that you didn't
put it on the credit card.

38:20.204 --> 38:22.346
I love that you think we
still have credit cards.

38:23.673 --> 38:26.403
If I can't convince the network
to not cancel our show...

38:26.802 --> 38:28.335
I don't know what we're gonna do.

38:28.360 --> 38:29.524
We're gonna figure it out.

38:30.126 --> 38:32.735
Right? We always do.

38:33.735 --> 38:36.295
Yeah. We always do.

38:36.320 --> 38:37.712
Look at it...

38:38.890 --> 38:40.008
<i>Kelly!</i>

38:40.735 --> 38:41.938
<i>Brenda, hi.</i>

38:42.358 --> 38:43.358
<i>Hi.</i>

38:43.383 --> 38:44.702
<i>You remember my brother.</i>

38:44.727 --> 38:45.952
- Nate!
- Yeah.

38:45.977 --> 38:47.678
They're watching 90210.

38:47.703 --> 38:49.921
Well, yeah, they wanted to know
what Mommy was doing in Vegas,

38:49.945 --> 38:51.803
so I thought it was better

38:51.828 --> 38:53.468
than telling them that
you were in prison.

38:53.867 --> 38:55.086
They're getting bored, don't worry.

38:55.110 --> 38:56.110
<i>Hi.</i>

38:56.610 --> 38:58.249
Look, Mom, it's you and Aunt Jennie.

38:58.274 --> 39:00.733
Did you know that you were
in a TV show together?

39:00.758 --> 39:01.928
<i>Working on my back.</i>

39:01.953 --> 39:03.985
<i>I spent all last Saturday
lying on it, so...</i>

39:04.531 --> 39:05.694
Yeah, baby.

39:14.524 --> 39:16.194
Before you say anything...

39:18.156 --> 39:19.453
I'm sorry, I've...

39:20.235 --> 39:21.428
I... I was a dick last night.

39:21.453 --> 39:24.719
I wasn't trying to be insensitive.

39:27.274 --> 39:28.938
That's what I love about you.

39:29.474 --> 39:31.108
You don't have to try.

39:34.985 --> 39:36.344
I'm sorry.

39:40.996 --> 39:41.996
Love you.

39:42.891 --> 39:44.453
I love you, too.

39:47.166 --> 39:48.999
Hey, schmooze.

39:49.024 --> 39:50.491
- Say hi to Aunt Jennie.
- Hi.

39:50.516 --> 39:51.664
They don't care.

39:52.774 --> 39:55.452
Okay. Does this mean
you're gonna help me think

39:55.477 --> 39:57.655
of some new reality show ideas?

39:57.680 --> 40:01.891
Uh, as your friend, no, I'm not.

40:01.916 --> 40:05.057
I don't want you wasting your
time on that crap anymore.

40:07.010 --> 40:10.143
So... what am I gonna do?

40:18.838 --> 40:19.860
Tor?

40:21.549 --> 40:22.679
Oh, my God.

40:23.124 --> 40:24.775
It's right in front of us.

40:25.455 --> 40:27.525
Like, it's literally...
It's right in front of us.

40:27.550 --> 40:28.705
Come, get up, get up.

40:28.730 --> 40:29.730
Come here.

40:29.755 --> 40:31.119
- What?
- Look.

40:31.144 --> 40:32.994
Okay, think about all the stuff

40:33.019 --> 40:34.447
that went down this weekend.

40:34.472 --> 40:35.940
Oh, yeah, I did.

40:35.965 --> 40:37.983
And then I ate an edible.

40:40.432 --> 40:41.820
90210.

40:42.135 --> 40:44.158
This is the time to do a reboot.

40:46.149 --> 40:47.407
No. No.

40:47.441 --> 40:49.494
- Have you lost your mind?
- Maybe.

40:50.369 --> 40:52.280
Wasn't Vegas enough punishment?

40:52.305 --> 40:53.877
And that was without Shannen.

40:56.823 --> 40:57.823
Oh.

41:03.135 --> 41:05.172
What is the thing that that guy said?

41:05.197 --> 41:07.369
You can't go home again.

41:08.487 --> 41:09.814
- What guy?
- I don't know, some guy.

41:09.838 --> 41:11.400
I only went to fake high school.

41:13.166 --> 41:14.770
But maybe you can.

41:16.900 --> 41:20.580
Maybe going back is
just what we all need

41:21.259 --> 41:23.025
to move forward.

41:30.908 --> 41:32.416
<i>- Say hello.
- Oh, really?</i>

41:32.441 --> 41:33.775
<i>I-I-I'll tell him that.</i>

41:34.635 --> 41:36.846
- We're so young.
- Hmm.

41:48.981 --> 41:50.502
Welcome to paradise, man.

41:50.527 --> 41:51.830
Mm.

41:53.378 --> 41:55.396
Welcome to your dream come true.
