WEBVTT

00:10.547 --> 00:13.714
(theme music playing)

00:17.673 --> 00:19.923
Hey.
Have you ever gotten
a mani-pedi?

00:20.589 --> 00:22.631
Uh, I've gotten
a manicure.

00:22.714 --> 00:25.839
-Really?
-Uh, but I've never
got a pedicure.

00:25.923 --> 00:28.130
The toes rank
second on the body

00:28.214 --> 00:30.923
only to the testicles
in terms of how
repulsive they are.

00:31.005 --> 00:33.881
-Hey. You know Hobe Turner?
-He was a writer on Seinfeld.

00:33.964 --> 00:36.506
-Yeah. Of course. Yeah.
-Okay. Doing a movie

00:36.589 --> 00:39.506
starring Jon Hamm,
and Jon Hamm

00:39.589 --> 00:42.798
is playing
a Larry David-type writer.

00:42.881 --> 00:46.381
They're going against type,
and he wants to, uh,

00:46.464 --> 00:48.714
follow you around,
spend a day with you.

00:48.798 --> 00:50.005
Yeah, let's do it.

00:50.089 --> 00:51.881
I'm gonna try and make
it happen for tomorrow.

00:51.964 --> 00:53.381
-That'll be fun.
-Yeah, it will be fun.

00:53.464 --> 00:54.381
Susie:
We're back!

00:54.464 --> 00:55.714
All right, listen.

00:55.798 --> 00:58.005
We are not getting along
at all.

00:58.089 --> 00:59.756
Susie and I are at odds.

00:59.839 --> 01:01.547
Oh, my God.
I, I don't even know--

01:01.631 --> 01:02.881
-Susie: Saw your car!
-Hi!

01:02.964 --> 01:04.631
-Hi, ladies. Hi.
-Oh.

01:04.714 --> 01:06.255
-Well, well, well.
-Hi.

01:06.339 --> 01:07.381
-Hey, look who's here?
-Hey.

01:07.464 --> 01:09.839
-I'm glad you're here.
-Are you?

01:09.923 --> 01:12.047
I never thought
I'd hear those words
come out of your mouth.

01:12.130 --> 01:14.464
Okay.
So, Becky, my sister...

01:14.547 --> 01:16.464
-Larry: Uh-huh.
-...is selling that house
we bought her.

01:16.547 --> 01:19.005
-Really?
-And what's really
interesting is,

01:19.089 --> 01:20.172
it's appreciated,

01:20.255 --> 01:21.714
because that section
of town is, like--

01:21.798 --> 01:24.005
Fantastic!
Make a little dough!

01:24.089 --> 01:25.631
Becky's gonna make some money.

01:25.714 --> 01:27.839
What do you mean
she'll make some money?

01:27.923 --> 01:29.506
I bought the house.

01:29.589 --> 01:31.422
-We bought the house.
-Larry: Okay, yeah, okay.

01:31.506 --> 01:33.089
-And we gave it...
-Larry: We bought the house.

01:33.172 --> 01:34.089
-...as a gift.
-Okay.

01:34.172 --> 01:35.923
A gift-- It wasn't a gift

01:36.005 --> 01:37.756
for her to sell
and make money.

01:37.839 --> 01:39.255
It was a gift for her
to live in.

01:39.339 --> 01:41.089
-You gave it to her.
It was a gift.
-Cheryl: Yeah. You--

01:41.172 --> 01:43.047
I didn't give her the house
so she could sell it.

01:43.130 --> 01:44.464
What if she sold it
in three days?

01:44.547 --> 01:46.047
Would she be allowed
to keep the money?

01:46.130 --> 01:48.339
-She's flipping houses now?
-She's been there for 15 years.

01:48.422 --> 01:49.756
That's not exactly a flip.

01:49.839 --> 01:52.714
So she's gonna sell it
and make this tremendous
profit?

01:52.798 --> 01:55.214
-And get everything?
-That's, that's crazy talk.

01:55.297 --> 01:56.881
-Larry: That's insane.
-Why are you siding with him?

01:56.964 --> 01:58.339
-What do you mean,
why am I siding with him?
-No!

01:58.422 --> 01:59.714
Jeff:
That's the right thing!

01:59.798 --> 02:01.631
Listen, I don't wanna be

02:01.714 --> 02:02.631
in the middle of this.

02:02.714 --> 02:04.297
I don't really
talk to Becky.

02:04.381 --> 02:05.381
Why?

02:05.464 --> 02:07.589
We've grown apart
through the years.

02:07.673 --> 02:09.631
She calls me
Queen Elizabeth.

02:09.714 --> 02:11.673
She calls herself
Princess Margaret--

02:11.756 --> 02:13.214
-Queen Elizabeth?
-Yeah.

02:13.297 --> 02:15.047
Oh, yeah.
'Cause you got everything.

02:15.130 --> 02:17.798
-That's what she says.
-And she's jealous.

02:17.881 --> 02:19.547
So if you're comfortable...

02:19.631 --> 02:22.130
-going to her and asking
her for money--
-Oh, you better believe it.

02:22.214 --> 02:23.923
Oh, you better believe it.
I feel comfortable.

02:24.005 --> 02:25.923
All right, well, you do it,
because Cheryl doesn't
feel comfortable.

02:26.005 --> 02:27.714
-Is that a character?
-Larry: Yeah. Kramer.

02:27.798 --> 02:29.214
-Jeff: Oh.
-Oh, I feel comfortable.

02:29.297 --> 02:32.005
-Cheryl: Okay.
-Oh, you better believe it.

02:33.422 --> 02:36.839
This Hobe Turner movie
is, like, one of the--
is a big thing for me.

02:36.923 --> 02:38.798
-Yeah.
-And I'm excited to do it.
And, you know,

02:38.881 --> 02:40.464
the guy is kind of
based on you.

02:40.547 --> 02:43.506
So the best way
I can figure it
is to just hang out.

02:43.589 --> 02:45.964
-You know. I ask--
-It's not gonna be easy, Jon.

02:46.047 --> 02:47.589
I'm a very complex man.

02:47.673 --> 02:49.506
-Very complicated.
-(laughs) I get it.

02:49.589 --> 02:51.422
But I just wanna say
I'd really appreciate it.

02:51.506 --> 02:53.214
-You'd appreciate it.
-Yes, I would.

02:53.297 --> 02:57.297
Really. This--
this word "appreciate,"
it's very, very odd.

02:57.381 --> 02:59.506
People seem to think
that if they use
the word "appreciate,"

02:59.589 --> 03:01.506
all of a sudden,
the seas part for them.

03:01.589 --> 03:04.339
"Oh, hey, I'm so sorry
that I...

03:04.422 --> 03:06.089
"I robbed your house
and burned it down.

03:06.172 --> 03:08.297
I'd really appreciate it if
you wouldn't tell the cops."

03:08.381 --> 03:12.089
-You know?
-(laughing): This is exactly
what I'm talking about.

03:12.714 --> 03:16.047
-This is perfect.
-All right. Let's order
the main course.

03:16.130 --> 03:17.673
Yes, we should.

03:17.756 --> 03:20.130
-There's so many
things on this.
-I can't look at these menus.

03:20.214 --> 03:22.714
There's so much.
Oh, you know what?

03:22.798 --> 03:25.673
We should just ask them.
They got-- They know
what they're doing.

03:25.756 --> 03:26.923
Ho-bo-bo. Ho-ho-ho-ho.

03:27.005 --> 03:28.756
Why are you--
Why are you doing this?

03:28.839 --> 03:32.339
Excuse me. What, uh--
What'd you guys get?

03:32.422 --> 03:33.923
Why do you want to know?

03:34.005 --> 03:35.923
Because we're about to order.

03:36.005 --> 03:37.631
But, uh, you have a menu.

03:37.714 --> 03:39.589
Yeah, but I figured,
you know,

03:39.673 --> 03:42.047
you're the experts,
why not copy you.

03:42.130 --> 03:44.297
Why would you think
we're the experts?

03:44.381 --> 03:45.798
Chinese.

03:45.881 --> 03:48.798
-Ai-yah!
-That doesn't make us
an expert on food.

03:48.881 --> 03:50.005
Yeah. Yeah, I think it does.

03:50.089 --> 03:51.881
I mean, if there was
a table of fat people,

03:51.964 --> 03:53.297
and a table of skinny people,

03:53.381 --> 03:55.339
I'd ask the fat people
what they were getting.

03:55.422 --> 03:58.297
'Cause they're a little
more expert at eating
than the skinny people.

03:58.381 --> 03:59.506
Anyway...

03:59.589 --> 04:02.673
-Return to your meal.
-All: Thank you.

04:04.506 --> 04:07.297
-What?
-This is gold.

04:10.214 --> 04:11.339
-Schmo-hawk.
-Yeah, schmo-hawk.

04:11.422 --> 04:12.506
-I thought I heard that.
-Yeah.

04:12.589 --> 04:14.089
But I wasn't sure
I heard it right.

04:14.172 --> 04:15.714
-S-C-H?
-S-C-H.

04:15.798 --> 04:16.923
You know,
you got the "schmo."

04:17.005 --> 04:19.297
-(laughing)
-It's a schmo. Yeah.

04:20.172 --> 04:22.214
It's the browsing, right?
You can't stand it.

04:22.297 --> 04:23.673
-You hate it.
-No browsing.

04:23.756 --> 04:25.422
-No browsing. Yeah.
-No browsing.

04:25.506 --> 04:28.589
-You own this stand?
-No. I work for the owner.

04:28.673 --> 04:31.172
What do you do
if you have to go
to the bathroom?

04:31.255 --> 04:32.506
I don't go.

04:33.381 --> 04:34.756
You don't go.

04:34.839 --> 04:36.130
The whole shift,
you don't go?

04:36.214 --> 04:38.464
I can't go.
I have to watch.

04:38.547 --> 04:39.964
All right. You know what?

04:40.047 --> 04:42.005
Do you have to go
to the bathroom now?

04:43.339 --> 04:45.089
-Go. I'll watch it.
-You'll watch it?

04:45.172 --> 04:47.297
-I'll watch the stand. Go.
-Okay. Put this on.

04:47.381 --> 04:49.089
-Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
-Thank you.
Thank you so--

04:49.172 --> 04:50.547
Yeah. You're, you're,
you're welcome.

04:50.631 --> 04:51.881
I really have to go.

04:51.964 --> 04:53.339
-No browsing, okay?
-No browsing.

04:53.422 --> 04:55.005
-You browse, you buy.
-You browse, you buy.

04:55.089 --> 04:57.589
-Thank you.
-Take your time.
Take your time.

04:57.673 --> 04:59.881
Get your papers here.
Papers!

04:59.964 --> 05:01.923
Magazines. Newspapers!

05:02.964 --> 05:04.339
Sir.

05:04.422 --> 05:05.798
-Oh.
-Sir.

05:05.881 --> 05:08.130
-Sorry, no browsing.
-I'm not browsing.

05:08.214 --> 05:11.673
The rule here is,
you buy, then browse.

05:11.756 --> 05:13.798
Customer:
I browse to buy.

05:13.881 --> 05:15.422
I know, but that's--
I'm sorry.

05:15.506 --> 05:16.881
That's, that's just
not gonna work.

05:16.964 --> 05:18.339
What the fuck?

05:18.422 --> 05:19.923
-Hey!
-Hey.

05:20.005 --> 05:21.756
Yeah, sorry. Yeah.

05:22.214 --> 05:24.839
L.D. What the--
What are you, nuts?

05:24.923 --> 05:26.589
-No.
-Are you having
a breakdown?

05:26.673 --> 05:28.172
-Richard: Hey, Jon.
-Hey, how are you?

05:28.255 --> 05:29.881
-Jon Hamm.
-Yeah, it's nice to meet you.
Big fan.

05:29.964 --> 05:31.714
What is-- What the f--
What, are you guys...

05:31.798 --> 05:33.255
-...escaped from
a mental institution?
-No.

05:33.339 --> 05:34.839
The guy had to go
to the bathroom,
so I took over.

05:34.923 --> 05:36.714
-So get this--
-What, what are
you guys doing?

05:36.798 --> 05:38.506
Jon's starring in a movie.

05:38.589 --> 05:40.547
-Well, what else is new?
-And the character...

05:40.631 --> 05:42.172
The character's based on me.

05:42.255 --> 05:43.673
So he's kind of shadowing me.

05:43.756 --> 05:45.839
What's the name of the movie?
The Biggest Asshole...

05:45.923 --> 05:47.714
-... That Ever
Roamed the Earth?
-Larry: Oh, I like that.

05:47.798 --> 05:49.422
-(laughing)
-Yeah, that's, that's good.

05:49.506 --> 05:51.339
-I'll tell Hobe.
-That's good.

05:51.422 --> 05:54.214
You're a great actor,
but this could be the end.

05:54.297 --> 05:55.506
So what are you doing?

05:55.589 --> 05:57.255
You know Michelle,
the CEO...

05:57.339 --> 05:58.964
-...I'm dating?
-Yeah, I know she's a CEO.

05:59.047 --> 06:01.339
Well, I gotta go
furniture shopping
with her today.

06:01.422 --> 06:03.130
Furniture shopping?

06:03.214 --> 06:04.381
Yeah, but I gotta
really get going.

06:04.464 --> 06:06.339
-Larry: Okay.
-Why don't we have a meal?

06:06.422 --> 06:07.673
We haven't had dinner
in a while.

06:07.756 --> 06:09.172
Yeah, let's do it.
Let's have dinner.

06:09.255 --> 06:11.631
-Can, uh, Michelle come?
-No.

06:11.714 --> 06:13.798
Listen, I--
I really want her
to come. I--

06:13.881 --> 06:15.339
I really would appreciate it.

06:15.422 --> 06:17.673
See? See what I'm saying
with the "appreciate"?

06:17.756 --> 06:19.714
-I'm finally starting to get it.
I see what you're saying. Yes.
-Huh? You see it?

06:19.798 --> 06:21.130
Richard:
What are you
talking about?

06:21.214 --> 06:23.881
I don't succumb
to "appreciate."

06:23.964 --> 06:26.214
I'm not gonna bring her.
For you, okay?

06:26.297 --> 06:27.714
-Larry: Yeah.
-To honor our friendship.

06:27.798 --> 06:29.964
-But she's gonna give me
shit for it.
-Larry: So what?

06:30.047 --> 06:31.756
You're gonna pay
down the line for this.

06:31.839 --> 06:34.464
-You text me where you
want to meet, asshole.
-Okay.

06:37.089 --> 06:39.130
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

06:39.214 --> 06:40.381
-Oh, sure.
-That was quick.

06:40.464 --> 06:42.881
-I feel so much better.
-I'm sure you do.

06:42.964 --> 06:44.547
-Get this off me.
-Okay.

06:44.631 --> 06:46.964
-What do I owe you?
-You owe me nothing.

06:47.047 --> 06:49.839
-Nothing. Oh, boy.
-Larry: No. I insist.

06:49.923 --> 06:52.756
-Yeah.
-Thank you. That piss
was worth $10, easy.

06:52.839 --> 06:55.673
Well, see ya, man.
I mean, look what you did.

06:55.756 --> 06:57.506
Yeah.

06:57.589 --> 06:59.506
A $10 piss.

07:01.339 --> 07:04.756
-Mm. Mm.
-And he offered me $10
to take a piss.

07:04.839 --> 07:07.172
-Wow.
-And I'm thinking...

07:07.255 --> 07:09.339
what a great idea
for a business.

07:09.422 --> 07:11.964
You relieve people
who have jobs

07:12.047 --> 07:13.923
where they can't
use a bathroom.

07:14.005 --> 07:16.547
Toll booth collectors,
shoe shine stands,

07:16.631 --> 07:18.130
parking garage attendants.

07:18.214 --> 07:20.714
They contact you
on your phone,
it's an app,

07:20.798 --> 07:23.547
and then you go down
and man the store,

07:23.631 --> 07:24.798
when they go to the bathroom.

07:24.881 --> 07:26.381
Do you know how many times
I've peed

07:26.464 --> 07:27.798
in a fuckin'
Gatorade bottle

07:27.881 --> 07:29.381
when I couldn't find
a fuckin' bathroom?

07:29.464 --> 07:30.964
Plenty of fuckin' times.

07:31.047 --> 07:32.089
Mm-hmm.

07:32.172 --> 07:33.756
And know how
many times I forgot

07:33.839 --> 07:35.214
I peed in that
Gatorade bottle

07:35.297 --> 07:37.506
and drank that shit?
Once.

07:38.047 --> 07:39.506
That's a fuckin'
good idea.

07:39.589 --> 07:40.756
Thanks for sharing
that story.

07:40.839 --> 07:42.172
This could be
the pee Amazon.

-You know? This, this is big.
-This could be big.

07:44.422 --> 07:45.547
-This could be very big.
-Every fuckin' where.

07:45.631 --> 07:46.964
-Yeah.
-Very big. We need a name.

07:47.047 --> 07:48.798
-Poober.
-Poober!

07:48.881 --> 07:50.964
-Meh. It's too close to Uber.
-Meh.

07:51.047 --> 07:52.631
I got something.

07:52.714 --> 07:54.005
"Gotta Go."

07:54.089 --> 07:56.130

That's catchy as hell.

Can I talk to you

Wow.

What, did you have
a party in here?

08:24.798 --> 08:27.214
Nope. Nope. Just me.

08:27.297 --> 08:29.047
Can I make you
something to drink?

08:29.756 --> 08:31.255
Uh, no, thanks.

08:31.339 --> 08:33.005
Okay.

08:33.089 --> 08:35.464
You know, you're trying
to sell a house.

08:35.547 --> 08:36.923
-It's-- (laughs)
-Oh.

08:37.005 --> 08:38.964
It's gonna be hard
to sell a house like,
like this.

08:39.047 --> 08:40.923
I gotta tidy up a bit,
I know.

08:41.005 --> 08:43.381
You know, it's all based
on first impressions.

08:43.464 --> 08:45.714
-People come over,
they're gonna see this...
-Yeah.

08:45.798 --> 08:47.047
...and then no one's
gonna buy it.

08:47.130 --> 08:49.089
All right.
I'll take care of it, Dad.

08:49.172 --> 08:51.089
-(laughs) Oh. Yeah.
-Hey.

08:51.172 --> 08:53.964
Heard about the whole
Cheryl-Ted blowup in Mexico.

08:54.047 --> 08:55.798
-Oh.
-(laughs)
Oh, boy.

08:55.881 --> 08:58.047
-Little bit of ash. Sorry.
-Yeah, that was...

08:58.130 --> 09:00.172
-That was wild.
-Yeah, that made me happy.

09:00.255 --> 09:02.005
-Oh, you-- Really?
-Little Miss Perfect.
Yeah.

09:02.089 --> 09:03.923
It made me feel better
about myself.

09:04.589 --> 09:06.631
Boy, you two used
to get along so well.

09:06.714 --> 09:08.631
Yeah, well, not anymore.

09:08.714 --> 09:10.964
You sure I can't get you
something to drink?

09:11.047 --> 09:12.964
No. What are you drinking
in the daytime for?

09:13.047 --> 09:15.381
-Who drinks in the daytime?
-People who go to brunch.

09:15.464 --> 09:16.881
Well, we're not at brunch.

09:16.964 --> 09:18.839
Okay.
So I am not having
a mimosa.

09:19.381 --> 09:22.297
-All right.

What do you want?

09:22.381 --> 09:24.005
-What, what's going on?
-Okay. Well,

09:24.089 --> 09:25.714
obviously, I heard
you're selling the house.

09:25.798 --> 09:27.339
Yeah.
(clears throat)

09:27.422 --> 09:29.756
You know,
the thing is, Becky,

09:29.839 --> 09:32.839
you know, I did buy you
the house, so...

09:32.923 --> 09:34.881
-I know.
-It's kind of my house.

09:34.964 --> 09:37.756
-No. No, you--
-I paid for the house.

09:37.839 --> 09:40.881
-And I thought it was only
fair and reasonable--
-Okay.

09:40.964 --> 09:44.005
I'm gonna let you
keep the profits

09:44.089 --> 09:45.422
to, to the house.

09:45.506 --> 09:48.381
But of course,
I'll get my investment back.

09:48.464 --> 09:51.464
No, no, no. No.

09:51.839 --> 09:55.631

Say I gave you $700,000--

Please don't do
this to me, okay?

09:59.506 --> 10:01.422
Please don't do this.
This is my house.

10:01.506 --> 10:02.923
It's all I have left.

10:03.005 --> 10:06.798
(sobbing): Oh, my God.
Please don't do this to me.

10:06.881 --> 10:09.005
I, I lost my job.

10:09.089 --> 10:10.631
And my boyfriend
broke up with me.

10:10.839 --> 10:12.631
-Geez. Don't cry--
-He was from Poland,

10:12.714 --> 10:15.881
and it turns out
all he wanted was a visa.

-Okay, you...

10:19.005 --> 10:21.964
Forget, forget it.
You, you, you can keep
the house.

You can keep all the money,
keep, keep the profits.

-Keep it all.

10:30.964 --> 10:33.881
-Thank you, Larry.
-Keep it. You can have it.

10:33.964 --> 10:36.047
Yeah. It's okay.

I love daytime sex.

You're filled with energy.

-Yes! I mean, nighttime,
you're so close to going to bed.
-Filled!

10:57.464 --> 10:59.297
-Right!
-Why are you doing that
before you go to bed?

all flipped around.

Becky!

11:20.798 --> 11:21.964
What did she say?

11:22.047 --> 11:24.214
She said,
"Guess who I fucked?"

11:24.297 --> 11:27.005
-Huh...
-Oh, my God.

11:27.089 --> 11:29.881
-He did.
-Oh, my God!

11:29.964 --> 11:31.839
-What, what are you thinking?
-I was there,

11:31.923 --> 11:35.506
and she was,
she-she was upset,
she was sobbing,

11:35.589 --> 11:37.506

11:37.589 --> 11:39.339
And, you know, it just,
it happened.

-Larry: That's why.
-Yeah, what about the money?

11:41.172 --> 11:42.464
I told her, uh,

11:42.547 --> 11:44.339
she didn't have to, uh,
share the money with me.

11:44.422 --> 11:46.673
-Oh, my God.
-That's, that's
like prostitution.

11:46.756 --> 11:49.214
-It was consensual sex
between two adults!
-Oh, my God.

11:49.297 --> 11:52.005
-There's nothing wrong
with that, as far as I know!
-Susie: She was vulnerable.

11:52.089 --> 11:54.130
We were all in the
living room over there

11:54.214 --> 11:55.673
when you gave a big speech,

11:55.756 --> 11:57.381
and you were gonna
march over there

11:57.464 --> 11:59.464
-and get your money back
for that house.
-I did march over there,

11:59.547 --> 12:00.923
and then I felt sorry for her.

12:01.005 --> 12:02.381
-Oh, my--
-Yeah, you marched over there,

12:02.464 --> 12:03.756
you got
a fuckin' blow job,

12:03.839 --> 12:05.214
and then you gave
the house away.

There's a million
fuckin' women
in the world.

12:07.255 --> 12:10.214

with Cheryl's sister?
-What?

12:11.923 --> 12:13.673

-He's, he's, um...
-Hold on. Yeah,
I should get this down.

12:18.547 --> 12:19.673
He's starring in a movie,

12:19.756 --> 12:21.214
and he's kind of,
you know, shadowing me.

12:21.297 --> 12:22.839
He's bas--
The character's based on me.

12:22.923 --> 12:25.214
So, the character
is a disgusting pervert?

12:25.297 --> 12:27.047
That's good.
(laughs)

12:27.130 --> 12:29.047
It's actually not funny,
Jon Hamm.

12:29.297 --> 12:31.047
Oh, no, no. I'm not here.
Act like I'm not here.

12:31.130 --> 12:32.881

on the wall. Just, uh--
-Larry: Hey.

12:32.964 --> 12:34.381
-New sneaks?
-Oh, yeah.

12:34.464 --> 12:36.005
-Good, right?
How comfortable?
-Love 'em.

12:36.089 --> 12:38.589
-Yeah.
-Cheryl: Hey, guys?
This is not the time, okay?

12:38.673 --> 12:40.214
It's my house,
you're in my house.

12:40.297 --> 12:42.005
-Jon: I'm terribly sorry.
-You crossed a line...

12:42.089 --> 12:43.589
-...this time.
-You crossed a line!

12:43.673 --> 12:45.130
-Oh, my God.
-Larry: I didn't cross a line.

12:45.214 --> 12:47.255
I went over the line
that you already crossed.

12:47.339 --> 12:48.589
-What?
-Larry: He's a friend.

12:48.673 --> 12:50.881
Oh, oh, oh, I'm sorry.
Ted and Larry,

12:50.964 --> 12:53.464
it's just like
you and your sister.
It's the same thing.

12:53.547 --> 12:55.923
-It's nowhere close.
-It is not close.

12:56.005 --> 12:58.923
It is close! She slept
with my friend, Ted Danson.

12:59.005 --> 13:00.756
-Okay?
-Larry: Okay.
That's fine.

13:00.839 --> 13:03.255
-But I can't sleep
with her sister?
-It feels like the same thing.

13:03.339 --> 13:06.422
-Because Ted is like
a sister to Larry.
-Larry: Yeah!

13:06.506 --> 13:08.422
No. It's a relationship
with Ted.

13:08.506 --> 13:10.381
-It's not,
I didn't just go have s--
-Larry: Oh, it's a relationship?

13:10.464 --> 13:12.172
Who's to say that I'm not
gonna have a relationship

13:12.255 --> 13:13.673
-with Becky,
what do you mean?
-Cheryl: Oh, my God.

13:13.756 --> 13:16.130
Susie:
You know how jealous
Becky is of Cheryl.

13:16.214 --> 13:19.798
You know that Becky thinks
of herself as Princess Margaret,

13:19.881 --> 13:21.756
and that Cheryl
is Queen Elizabeth.

13:21.839 --> 13:23.923
-Yeah. Right.
-Yeah. Oh, and you think
you're Prince Philip?

13:24.005 --> 13:25.130
Is that what you're saying?

13:25.214 --> 13:26.631
-Yeah.
-Cheryl: Oh, my God.

13:26.714 --> 13:29.631
Prince Philip would put
a fucking gun to his head

13:29.714 --> 13:31.923
before he had you
representing him.

13:32.005 --> 13:33.964
Again, real quick,
are we talking about
The Crown  now?

13:34.047 --> 13:35.589
-Yeah.
-How good is that show?

13:35.673 --> 13:37.964
You know what, Jon Hamm,
it was nice meeting you.

13:38.047 --> 13:39.631
But, really,
this is between us.

13:39.714 --> 13:42.422
You know what,
I've heard enough.
Come on, Jonny. Let's go eat.

13:42.506 --> 13:44.089
-I'll call you.
-You've had enough...

13:44.172 --> 13:45.547
-...you petty piece of shit.
-Thank you so much,
by the way.

13:45.631 --> 13:47.589
Susie:
Yeah, it's great.
It's great.

13:47.673 --> 13:50.172
-Go, go be him, asshole.
-Thank you.

13:54.339 --> 13:56.464
-Aw, man.
-Larry: What are you doing?

13:56.547 --> 13:59.547
You just plopped
that into your,
into your water?

13:59.631 --> 14:02.172
Yeah, I plopped it in
because I like lime
with my water.

14:02.255 --> 14:04.673
I know but they,
they don't wash
these rinds.

14:04.756 --> 14:06.464
You gotta have
some trust in people.

14:06.547 --> 14:09.172
You ever see
signs in bathrooms,
"Wash before leaving"?

14:09.255 --> 14:10.881
It doesn't matter
if their hands are clean.

14:10.964 --> 14:12.506
-Richard: They don't have to--
-The rind's dirty.

14:12.589 --> 14:15.047
-You get a disease.
-Aah, please.

14:15.130 --> 14:16.673
It's bullshit.

14:16.756 --> 14:19.005
And I'm really irked
about something, man.

14:19.089 --> 14:20.506
Did you say "irked"?

14:21.089 --> 14:23.506
-Yeah, irked.
-I never heard you use
that word before, but go ahead.

14:23.589 --> 14:26.673
I'm irked because--
with all due respect--

14:26.756 --> 14:28.297
Jon is here, and Michelle is--

14:28.381 --> 14:29.881
you wouldn't let Michelle
come to dinner.

14:29.964 --> 14:31.839
I have to watch
my Ps and Qs.

14:31.923 --> 14:33.631
I don't wanna watch
Ps and Qs.

14:33.714 --> 14:35.047
Do you wanna watch
Ps and Qs?

14:35.130 --> 14:36.923
What are you, Shari Lewis?
Where's Lamb Chop?

14:37.005 --> 14:38.631
-In your pants?
-(laughing)

14:38.714 --> 14:42.005
-Look, she's irked.
-She's irked.

14:42.089 --> 14:43.506
So you're both irked?

14:43.589 --> 14:47.172
She's so angry at me
that I had to, you know,
make an excuse.

14:47.255 --> 14:48.547
Oh. What did you say?

14:48.631 --> 14:50.339
I said you had
a bleeding rectum,

14:50.422 --> 14:52.089
and that you were
worried and scared,

14:52.172 --> 14:53.839
and you needed
to talk to me alone,

14:53.923 --> 14:56.172
and you'd be embarrassed
if she heard it.

14:56.255 --> 14:58.714
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

14:58.798 --> 15:00.589
-Well...
-You couldn't think of
a better excuse than that?

15:00.673 --> 15:02.506
You should have called me.
I got thousands of 'em.

15:02.589 --> 15:04.923
-I can't even face her now.
-Why not?

15:05.005 --> 15:07.047
Nobody respects a person
with a bleeding rectum.

15:07.130 --> 15:09.214
You think Lincoln
could have prosecuted a war

15:09.297 --> 15:11.005
if people knew he had
a bleeding rectum?

15:11.089 --> 15:12.881
And by the way, when you
come to the dinner party

15:12.964 --> 15:14.547
in a few days,
I would not mention it.

15:14.631 --> 15:16.339
Who mentions that
at a dinner party?

15:16.422 --> 15:18.881
Do I still have it
or-or am I over it?

15:18.964 --> 15:20.964
No, I left it open.

15:21.047 --> 15:22.964
Sorry to hear that.

15:23.339 --> 15:24.964
Jon:
I also-- Can I say,

15:25.047 --> 15:26.589
we ordered this
kind of for the table,

15:26.673 --> 15:28.756
and I feel like you've
gone way over your

15:28.839 --> 15:30.297
appetizer allotment
at this point.

15:30.381 --> 15:32.547
-My allotment?

It's just like eating it
over the garbage can.

23:26.089 --> 23:27.881
-Alex: Huh?
-Larry: Yeah, yeah.
In a way.

23:27.964 --> 23:29.547
Oh, Michelle.

23:29.631 --> 23:32.506
-The walnut shrimp
is scrumptious.
-Mm.

23:32.589 --> 23:33.756
Scrumptious?

23:33.839 --> 23:35.881
-You think so?
-It's really good.

23:36.547 --> 23:38.923
-What are we waiting for?
-I mean, come on. Come on.

23:39.673 --> 23:41.422
-Larry: Hey, hey, hey, hey.
-What are you doing?

23:41.506 --> 23:43.673
-What are you doing?
I want the walnut shrimp?
-What are you doing?

23:43.756 --> 23:46.923
Andy:
I'm turning the Lazy Susan
the way it should be turned.

23:47.005 --> 23:48.798
-In order.
-Larry: No, no,
no, no, no.

23:48.881 --> 23:51.547
A Lazy Susan is like
a roundabout, okay?

23:51.631 --> 23:53.798
I'm sorry,
I don't think
you're right.

23:53.881 --> 23:55.589
-Cassie: Okay, can I--
-I don't think you know
how a roundabout works.

23:55.673 --> 23:57.255
It's first come, first serve.
That's a roundabout.

23:57.339 --> 23:59.756
-I do know how
a roundabout works.
-I don't think you do.

23:59.839 --> 24:02.047
-It works like a Lazy Susan.
-Larry: No!

24:02.130 --> 24:03.839
-The cars--
-That's now how
a lazy Susan works.

24:03.923 --> 24:05.464
-Can I ask you a favor, please?
-It's how a lazy Susan--

24:05.547 --> 24:07.214
Can I ask you both a favor?

24:07.297 --> 24:10.130
Can you please not use
that term "Lazy Susan"?

24:10.214 --> 24:12.923
It's got racist and sexist
connotations,

24:13.005 --> 24:14.381
and I'd really prefer

24:14.464 --> 24:16.756
-you just not call it that.
-Whoa.

24:16.839 --> 24:18.130
-Larry: Lazy Susan?
-Yes.

24:18.214 --> 24:19.798
Who's that racist towards?
Susans?

24:19.881 --> 24:21.839
Larry: That's crazy.
Where'd you get that?
-Cassie: Okay.

24:21.923 --> 24:23.881
I would just like you
to not use the term.

24:23.964 --> 24:25.673
You're right.
You know what?
It should be--

24:25.756 --> 24:27.714
We should definitely
start using
the Ambitious Susan.

24:27.798 --> 24:30.089
Yes, yes. Please spin
the Indefatigable Susan.

24:30.172 --> 24:33.839
Oh, can we have
the Multifaceted Susan
my way, please?

24:34.047 --> 24:35.798
Yeah, spin
the Industrious Susan.

24:35.881 --> 24:37.964
Ooh, can you spin
Ambidextrous Susan,
please.

24:38.047 --> 24:39.464
-Oh, the Ambidextrous Susan.
-Yes, both ways.

24:39.547 --> 24:41.255
-Both: Both ways.
-So funny. You want it?

24:41.339 --> 24:44.339
-You want it?
You want your stuff?
-Whoa!

24:44.422 --> 24:46.297
♪ ♪

24:46.381 --> 24:48.172
-(gasps)
-Whoa!

24:54.255 --> 24:55.923
Richard:
Oh, man.

24:56.839 --> 24:59.297
-Andy: Oh, boy.
-What did you do?

24:59.381 --> 25:01.130
-Larry: What? I, I didn't--
-What did you do?

25:01.214 --> 25:03.964
-She spun the thing
around like that.
-The thing, it was too fast.

25:04.047 --> 25:07.297
-You wouldn't shut up!
-(all arguing)

25:07.381 --> 25:09.839
I don't give a shit!
I want you out!

25:09.923 --> 25:12.756
-You're kicking me out?
-Michelle: Yeah. And you,

25:12.839 --> 25:14.673
Larry David Junior,
you can go, too.

25:14.756 --> 25:16.506
-You're kicking me out.
-Yes, Jon Hamm.

25:16.589 --> 25:19.172
-Hey, you're getting kicked out.
Look at that, beautiful.
-What's up, huh? Hey.

25:19.255 --> 25:21.047
Out!

25:21.464 --> 25:23.756
-All right.
-All right.

25:23.839 --> 25:26.005
-Okay. (grunts)
-We should, uh...

25:26.089 --> 25:27.756
-Eh.
-Eh.

25:34.506 --> 25:36.172
(cell phone rings)

25:36.255 --> 25:37.589
Larry:
Hey.

25:37.673 --> 25:39.839
Becky: Larry.
Oh, thank God
you answered.

25:39.923 --> 25:42.089
I just got in a huge accident
on Mount--

25:42.172 --> 25:43.547
-(screams)
-Wha?

25:43.631 --> 25:45.631
Becky (over phone):
It was a ski school
of children.

25:45.714 --> 25:47.881
They just flew
right in front of me. Ow!

25:47.964 --> 25:50.589
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

25:50.673 --> 25:52.089
They're taking me
to a hospital,

25:52.172 --> 25:53.714
and I don't--
I just don't know
where it is or...

25:53.798 --> 25:55.964
-I don't know this town.
-Okay, don't worry
about a thing.

25:56.047 --> 25:57.464
I'll be on the next flight
to Denver.

25:57.547 --> 25:59.381
-You would do that for me?
-Of course.

25:59.464 --> 26:02.214
Oh, my God, Larry.
You really are a prince.

26:02.297 --> 26:04.381
Don't worry. I'm calling
my travel agent right now.

26:04.464 --> 26:07.130
Thank you so, so much.
Ow!

26:07.214 --> 26:08.923
-(phone rings)
-Westside Travel and Tour.

26:09.005 --> 26:11.714
-Eliza speaking.
-Oh, hi. It's Larry David.
I have an emergency.

26:11.798 --> 26:13.881
I need to get
on the next flight
to Denver, please.

26:13.964 --> 26:16.047
I've got one leaving
in an hour and 40 minutes.

26:16.130 --> 26:18.005
Perfect. Fantastic.
Book it.

26:18.089 --> 26:20.047
Eliza:
Oh, you're lucky.
There's only one seat left.

26:20.130 --> 26:22.339
19E.

26:23.964 --> 26:25.381
19E.

26:25.464 --> 26:28.506
It's a coach seat.
Oh, it's a middle seat.

26:30.339 --> 26:32.047
Shall I book it?

26:32.130 --> 26:34.130
Any other flights
going to Denver?

26:34.214 --> 26:36.172
We've got a two,
a four,

26:36.255 --> 26:37.589
and a six.

26:37.673 --> 26:41.756
Anything in rows...
one through four?

26:41.839 --> 26:44.297
The only thing left
is coach.

26:45.422 --> 26:46.547
Okay.

26:47.673 --> 26:49.756
Give me the next
first-class flight to Denver.

26:49.839 --> 26:52.255
It's not until 9:00 p.m.

26:52.339 --> 26:54.506
9:00 p.m. Perfect.
I'll take it. Book it.

26:54.589 --> 26:55.964
Eliza:
Very well.

26:59.339 --> 27:01.464
(cell phone rings)

27:04.547 --> 27:05.381
Hey.

27:05.464 --> 27:06.297
Hey, Larry.

27:06.381 --> 27:07.547
I got a "Gotta Go"
emergency.

27:07.631 --> 27:09.214
I'm at the shoe shine shop,
right?

27:09.297 --> 27:11.005
And the guy must have
food poisoning.

27:11.089 --> 27:12.756
He's stuck on the fuckin'
toilet right now.

27:12.839 --> 27:14.130
So? What do you want
me to do?

27:14.214 --> 27:15.714
I need you to cover for me
at the newsstand.

27:15.798 --> 27:17.547
The guy relies on me
for his six o'clock piss.

27:17.631 --> 27:20.381
-I'll call you back.
-Leon (over phone):
Okay. Okay.

27:20.464 --> 27:22.381
-Larry: (claps) Hey.
-Yeah.

27:22.464 --> 27:24.798
I need you to do me a favor.
Actually, do Leon a favor.

27:24.881 --> 27:27.047
He needs somebody
to fill in for him
at the newsstand.

27:27.130 --> 27:28.798
-For the "Gotta Go" app?
-Yeah.

27:28.881 --> 27:29.881
I can't do it.

27:29.964 --> 27:31.506
No, no. You gotta do it.
I can't do it,

27:31.589 --> 27:32.798
because I have
to fly to Denver.

27:32.881 --> 27:35.297
-I already got
my sweats on.
-So what?

27:35.381 --> 27:36.798
Yeah, well, once I got
my sweats on,

27:36.881 --> 27:39.130
there's no going back.
I got my sweats on.

27:39.214 --> 27:41.047
What is it, an immutable
law of physics?

27:41.130 --> 27:42.464
Once you're in sweats,
you can't get out?

27:42.547 --> 27:43.506
Newton's Law of Sweats?

27:43.589 --> 27:46.756
It's Jeff Greene's Law
of Day Over.

27:46.839 --> 27:48.673
Listen, I'd really
appreciate it.

27:48.756 --> 27:51.297
-I'm in my sweats!
-(phone rings)

27:51.381 --> 27:53.381
-Hello?
-Larry, what the fuck
you doin', man?

27:53.464 --> 27:55.047
-Goddamn!
-Larry (over phone):
All right, okay!

27:55.130 --> 27:57.172
Shut the fuck up!
I'll come!

27:57.255 --> 27:59.047
Thank you.
Thank you, by the way.

27:59.130 --> 28:01.923
-(sneezes) Wow.
-Larry: God bless you.

28:07.005 --> 28:08.047
Hey.

28:08.130 --> 28:09.923
-Hey. I'm from "Gotta Go."
-Larry?

28:10.005 --> 28:12.005
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Oh.

28:12.089 --> 28:14.839
-I really gotta go.
-Okay. Okay. Hurry up.

28:14.923 --> 28:16.172
-Okay. I'll be quick.
-Okay.

28:16.255 --> 28:17.798
-Okay. Thank you.
-Yeah. Hurry up.

28:17.881 --> 28:19.214
Okay.

28:19.297 --> 28:21.714
(distant siren wailing)

28:22.130 --> 28:23.464
Fuck.

28:26.047 --> 28:27.172
Oh, my God.

28:27.255 --> 28:28.881
-(phone rings)
-Hello?

28:28.964 --> 28:30.673
Larry (over phone):
The newsstand guy
left 15 minutes ago.

28:30.756 --> 28:31.631
Hasn't come back.

28:31.714 --> 28:33.506
I gotta catch a plane to Denver.

28:33.589 --> 28:35.047
Hey, no browsing.

28:35.130 --> 28:36.714
Hey, do you carry
Vegan Living  ?

28:36.798 --> 28:38.673
Who gives a shit?
Get the hell out of here.

28:38.756 --> 28:40.047
You gotta come
and relieve me.

28:40.130 --> 28:41.923
I can't, Larry.
I'm at the shoe shine stand.

28:42.005 --> 28:43.631
This guy's taking
a $40 shit.

28:43.714 --> 28:45.798
Larry (over phone):
Aw! All right,
I'll get somebody else.

28:48.756 --> 28:50.714
Thanks very much.
Hey.

28:50.798 --> 28:51.798
Larry:
Hey!

28:51.881 --> 28:53.631
-I got your back.
-Oh, my God.

28:53.714 --> 28:55.547
-You are a lifesaver.
-No worries, no worries.

28:55.631 --> 28:58.047
-Thank you so much.
-Not at all.

28:58.130 --> 28:59.381
Jonny.

28:59.464 --> 29:01.089
Really appreciate this.

29:01.172 --> 29:02.839
Hey, no prob--

29:02.923 --> 29:04.714
-Ah? (laughing)
-Larry: Ah?

29:04.798 --> 29:06.506
I get it.
(laughs)

29:11.464 --> 29:12.964
Larry:
Oh, my God.

29:15.506 --> 29:16.881
Excuse me, I'm so sorry.

29:16.964 --> 29:18.506
I got seven minutes
to catch the plane.

29:18.589 --> 29:20.297
It sounds like a lie,
but it's not.

29:20.381 --> 29:21.631
I'm not a cutter by nature.

29:21.714 --> 29:23.923
Um, my, my girlfriend
got in a skiing accident.

29:24.005 --> 29:25.673
You know,
she's my ex-wife's sister.

29:25.756 --> 29:27.589
We don't have to get
into that, but,

29:27.673 --> 29:29.172
nevertheless,
thank you so much.

29:29.255 --> 29:31.297
-I really appreciate it.
-Next.

29:31.381 --> 29:32.673
Are you together?

29:34.714 --> 29:35.964
No.

29:36.506 --> 29:37.881
Man:
No.

29:38.964 --> 29:40.506
Why would you think
we were together?

29:40.589 --> 29:41.798
No reason.

29:41.881 --> 29:43.881
-No, no reason at all?
-No reason?

29:43.964 --> 29:45.464
I just assumed
you were a couple--

29:45.547 --> 29:46.923
-Woman: You assumed?
-Man: You assumed--

29:47.005 --> 29:48.881
-Oh, really?
-You assumed
we're a couple. We--

29:48.964 --> 29:50.589
I mean, I've never--
I mean, nice to meet you.

29:50.673 --> 29:53.089
-Nice to meet you, too.
-Yeah, see, look,
we just met.

29:53.172 --> 29:54.547
Honest mistake.

29:54.631 --> 29:56.631
But why did you
make the mistake?

29:56.714 --> 30:00.422
-That's what I'm wondering.
-Any two people standing
together could be a couple.

30:00.506 --> 30:02.005
Two men, two women.

30:02.089 --> 30:04.297
If I saw a man
wearing a yarmulke,

30:04.381 --> 30:06.506
standing next to a woman
wearing a kerchief

30:06.589 --> 30:08.339
and carrying a mahjong set,

30:08.422 --> 30:09.714
I would think
they were a couple.

30:09.798 --> 30:12.047
-What?
-It's just
a natural assumption.

30:12.130 --> 30:13.964
Anyway, I'd love to continue
our discussion.

30:14.047 --> 30:16.089
It's been very interesting.
I have to catch a flight
to Denver.

30:16.172 --> 30:18.964
-Eh, there's a lot of
black people in Denver.
-Yeah. Tell 'em we said hi.

30:19.047 --> 30:20.422
Hello, sir. Boarding pass?

30:20.506 --> 30:22.130
(beeps)

30:22.214 --> 30:24.589
You've been randomly selected
for a security search, sir.

30:24.673 --> 30:27.297
What? What? Secure--
What are you talking about?

30:27.381 --> 30:29.464
-Can someone get my spot?
Thank you.
-Larry: Oh, please.

30:29.547 --> 30:32.005
Are you kidding me?
Oh, they couldn't be
a couple.

30:32.089 --> 30:33.089
Oh, it's crazy.

30:33.172 --> 30:34.339
It has nothing to do
with that, sir.

30:34.422 --> 30:36.589
Oh, it has nothing to do
with that?

30:36.673 --> 30:38.631
-No.
-Come on, I'm gonna miss
my flight to Denver.

30:38.714 --> 30:40.798
-Enjoy that search. Yeah.
-Enjoy it.

30:40.881 --> 30:42.047
Honestly,
if you're looking--

30:42.130 --> 30:43.506
I wouldn't look in
the food and wine section.

30:43.589 --> 30:45.673
I would look...
Los Angeles  magazine.

30:45.756 --> 30:46.673
Right down there.

30:46.756 --> 30:48.130
You don't find what you need,

30:48.214 --> 30:49.964
-look online.
Everything's online.
-Thanks.

30:50.047 --> 30:51.756
Excuse me, ma'am.
No browsing.

30:51.839 --> 30:54.005
No, I'm just looking
for an article that
Jay Inslee--

30:54.089 --> 30:55.214
Both:
Oh.

30:55.297 --> 30:57.005
-Oh, hi.
-Cheryl.

30:57.089 --> 30:58.339
-Jon.
-That's me.

30:58.422 --> 30:59.464
-Hamm. Hi.
-Yes.

30:59.547 --> 31:00.631
What are you doing here?

31:00.714 --> 31:02.255
I'm just watching
the newsstand for Larry.

31:02.339 --> 31:04.464
He had to--
He had to jump out
and run to the airport.

31:04.547 --> 31:07.714
I'm sorry.
Does Larry own
a newsstand now?

31:07.798 --> 31:09.339
Great question.

31:09.422 --> 31:11.255
-I don't have an answer.
-Okay.

31:11.339 --> 31:14.214
-So you are Larry's
ex-wife. Wow.
-Yeah. I know.

31:14.297 --> 31:16.964
-I find that fascinating.
-Do you?

31:17.047 --> 31:19.547
Oh, my gosh.
Spending the last few days
with him?

31:19.631 --> 31:22.381
-I gotta know everything.
-It's a lot.

31:22.464 --> 31:24.714
Well, do you wanna
just go get some coffee?

31:24.798 --> 31:26.881
Sit down and talk?

31:26.964 --> 31:29.172
-Now?
-Well, yeah. Why not?

31:29.255 --> 31:31.130
-Okay. Uh...
-Let's go.

31:32.047 --> 31:33.881
I mean, do you really
wanna hear...

31:33.964 --> 31:36.047
Are you kidding me?
I wanna hear everything.

31:36.130 --> 31:38.381
Cheryl:
You might be bored.
Ah, 17 years...

31:38.464 --> 31:39.964
Jon:
Wow.

31:48.464 --> 31:50.172
Do you recognize
that signature?

31:50.255 --> 31:51.673
Leon:
He killed the motherfucker
'cause the waffles

31:51.756 --> 31:52.923
had expired and shit.

31:53.005 --> 31:55.631
Gonna sit in that room
and get interrogated--

31:55.714 --> 31:57.756
Hey. Okay? You happy?
You happy?

31:57.839 --> 31:59.547
-I hope you're happy.
-What the fuck, man?

31:59.631 --> 32:01.464
-I missed my flight to Denver.
-Jeff: Sorry.

32:01.547 --> 32:03.506
Larry:
Oh, because you wouldn't
get out of your sweat pants.

32:03.589 --> 32:05.339
Suppose there was an emergency?
Then what?

32:05.422 --> 32:06.506
You take the sweat pants off?

32:06.589 --> 32:07.881
Well, what kind of
an emergency?

32:07.964 --> 32:10.381
Suppose, uh, your friend
was in a car accident.

32:10.464 --> 32:13.255
-Which friend?
-Me. I got hit by a car.

32:13.339 --> 32:14.756
How did you get hit by a car?

32:14.839 --> 32:16.339
I, I got a piece of pizza, and,

32:16.422 --> 32:17.839
and I was crossing the street,

32:17.923 --> 32:19.255
and the, the cheese fell off,

32:19.339 --> 32:20.756
and I bent down
to pick up the cheese,

32:20.839 --> 32:22.130
and I got hit by a car.

32:22.214 --> 32:24.381
Who the hell picks up cheese
in the middle of the street?

32:24.464 --> 32:26.047
I don't want to litter
so I picked up the cheese

32:26.130 --> 32:27.589
and I put it
in the garbage can.

32:27.673 --> 32:29.923
No. You were gonna
pick up the cheese,

32:30.005 --> 32:31.506
and put it on your pizza
and eat it.

32:31.589 --> 32:33.631
Bullshit. I was not.
I was gonna throw it
in the garbage.

32:33.714 --> 32:34.923
-You don't know.
-I know.

32:35.005 --> 32:36.214
-What do you know?
No, you don't!
-I know.

32:36.297 --> 32:37.923
And you, fuckstick,
don't ever ask me

32:38.005 --> 32:40.089
to man any post for you again,
'cause I'm not doin' it!

32:40.172 --> 32:42.297
Just consider me
in sweatpants all the time.

32:42.381 --> 32:44.714
Fuck that job.
I quit that shit already.

32:44.798 --> 32:47.798
-Wow. That was fast.
-Fuck, yeah. I'm in and out.

32:47.881 --> 32:49.714
All right, I gotta go
text Becky now

32:49.798 --> 32:51.506
and tell her I missed my flight
'cause of you two assholes,

32:51.589 --> 32:52.964
and tell her I'll be on
the first flight out to Denver

32:53.047 --> 32:54.506
tomorrow morning.
Actually, second flight.

32:54.589 --> 32:56.005
Why second flight?

32:56.089 --> 32:57.631
First class.

32:57.714 --> 32:59.214
Yeah.

32:59.839 --> 33:02.798
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

33:02.881 --> 33:05.130
Oh, my God. What?

33:05.214 --> 33:07.047
Oh, my-- Larry!

33:07.130 --> 33:08.547
Larry!

33:09.964 --> 33:11.631
Larry!

33:11.714 --> 33:13.339
Cheryl:
Oh, look.

33:13.422 --> 33:14.464
Latte Larry's.

33:14.547 --> 33:15.964
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Spite store.

33:16.047 --> 33:17.089
-I heard about this.
-Yeah.

33:17.172 --> 33:18.756
-This must be, uh...
-Mocha Joe's.

33:18.839 --> 33:19.798
There we go.

33:19.881 --> 33:20.964
Okay, don't tell Larry
we did this.

33:21.047 --> 33:22.923
You got it.

33:23.005 --> 33:26.047
I've never been
in this shop. I just--

33:26.130 --> 33:28.673
It's kind of a wobbly table,
you know?

33:28.756 --> 33:30.506
It's like
my least favorite thing.

33:30.589 --> 33:31.839
-It's all right.
-Mocha Joe:
Here we go.

33:31.923 --> 33:33.714
-Two cups of coffee.
-Hey. Thank you very much.

33:33.798 --> 33:36.005
Thank you so much
for coming in, Mr. Hamm.
How's that scone?

33:36.089 --> 33:37.714
Uh, not so much a scone.

33:38.172 --> 33:40.714
-No, it's a scone.
-Nah, this is like a muffin.

33:40.798 --> 33:43.172
I mean, I'm just saying,
like, there's kind of a specific

33:43.255 --> 33:45.297
quality that a scone has
that's sort of dry and crumbly.

33:45.381 --> 33:47.798
This is sweet.
It's a little more like
a muffin than a scone.

33:47.881 --> 33:49.756
What you are describing
is a stale scone.

33:49.839 --> 33:52.673
-That's a, that's fresh one.
-I'm not sure you know
what a...

33:52.756 --> 33:54.005
definition of a scone is.

33:54.089 --> 33:56.047
It looks good.
I think, um...

33:56.130 --> 33:57.839
-I'm just saying,
I'm saying it's a muffin.
-Let's not worry about it.

33:57.923 --> 33:59.089
You want me to take it away?

33:59.172 --> 34:00.381
No, I'm gonna keep the muffin.

34:00.464 --> 34:01.839
-Thank you very much.
-You enjoy the scone.

34:01.923 --> 34:03.506
-Yeah, I'll enjoy the muffin.
-Cheryl: I'm good.

34:03.589 --> 34:05.631
-Thank you, that's great.
Thank you.
-Okay. Awesome.

34:05.714 --> 34:07.089
It doesn't matter.

34:07.172 --> 34:08.964
-Yeah. I'm just having
a good time.
-Hmm? Doesn't it?

34:10.089 --> 34:11.631
Um...

34:11.714 --> 34:13.798
Oh! So when
I first met Mocha Joe--

34:13.881 --> 34:16.047
Ugh. Oh, hold on.

34:16.130 --> 34:17.839
-No. No. No.
-What's wrong?

34:17.923 --> 34:18.881
Mocha Joe!

34:18.964 --> 34:21.130
-Mocha Joe!
-Mocha Joe: Yeah.

34:22.756 --> 34:25.214
This coffee's...
it's not hot.

34:25.297 --> 34:27.714
-It's plenty hot.
-No, it's, it's plenty not.

34:27.798 --> 34:30.589
-It's, it's, it is,
it is at best luke.
-It's hot.

34:30.673 --> 34:32.464
-Oh, God.
-Jon: I don't know
what to tell you.

34:32.547 --> 34:34.047
This is not, this is
not a hot cup of coffee.

34:34.130 --> 34:35.673
-It's a hot cup of coffee.
-Coffee should be served hot.

34:35.756 --> 34:36.714
-This is not hot.
-It's hot.

34:36.798 --> 34:38.214
I beg to differ.
This is not hot.

34:38.297 --> 34:39.839
And I tell you what.
Here's how I'll prove it
to you.

34:39.923 --> 34:41.047
-No, no, no, I don't know--
-Would I be able to do this?

34:41.130 --> 34:42.714
Would I be able to do this

34:42.798 --> 34:44.506
if this was a hot cup
of coffee?

34:45.130 --> 34:47.005
-Oh. Oh.
-Okay.

34:47.798 --> 34:49.881
-Doesn't even hurt.
Doesn't even hurt.
-I can't do this.

34:49.964 --> 34:51.172
-This coffee's not hot.
-Jon Hamm...

34:51.255 --> 34:52.964
-...you have
turned into Larry.
-What--

34:53.047 --> 34:55.047
-I'm done. I can't do this.
-Cheryl--

34:55.130 --> 34:56.047
Cheryl:
God.

34:56.130 --> 34:57.673
-Cheryl!
-No.

34:57.756 --> 34:59.506
-Come on.
-Nope.

35:00.464 --> 35:02.881
See, now look.
The table. Look at this.
All over the place.

35:02.964 --> 35:04.422
-All right,
you know what, Jon Hamm?
-All over the place.

35:04.506 --> 35:05.964
-Unbelievable.
-Get out.

35:06.339 --> 35:07.673
Happy to.

35:09.714 --> 35:11.547
And you're banned, Jon Hamm!

35:11.631 --> 35:13.631
Jon:
I don't care!

35:19.673 --> 35:20.923
Hey!

35:21.005 --> 35:23.089
I'm here!

35:23.172 --> 35:25.881
Look. Look! Flowers, balloons.

35:25.964 --> 35:28.631
Larry David.
What could be better?

35:28.714 --> 35:31.339
-Take a smell of that.
Yeah? Pretty good.
-Yep. Smells like flowers.

35:31.422 --> 35:33.381
-Right? Where do
you want 'em? Here?
-Yeah.

35:33.464 --> 35:36.005
Ugh.
I came as soon as I could.

35:36.089 --> 35:37.297
Did you?

35:37.381 --> 35:38.464
Yes, I did.

35:38.547 --> 35:41.214
'Cause it's, uh, been
a little over 24 hours

35:41.297 --> 35:42.964
since I called you
and you were gonna

35:43.047 --> 35:45.756
hop on the next flight.
So I just, I've been
a little confused.

35:45.839 --> 35:48.172
Big issue with the TSA
last night.

35:48.255 --> 35:50.964
-Ugh. I'm not even gonna
bore you with it.
-Why would book a night flight?

35:51.047 --> 35:53.130
I called you at 10:00 o'clock
yesterday morning.

35:53.214 --> 35:55.964
Um, you know, the--
I couldn't get a seat.
There were no seats.

35:56.047 --> 35:58.839
There were no seats
on any of the planes?

35:58.923 --> 36:01.255
There were...

36:01.339 --> 36:02.964
no seats...

36:03.047 --> 36:04.214
for me?

36:04.297 --> 36:08.047
Are you talking about
first class seats?

36:08.130 --> 36:11.047
Uh...

36:13.047 --> 36:14.631
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Becky: Yeah?

36:14.714 --> 36:16.005
I broke my leg!

36:16.089 --> 36:17.464
-I called you scared.
-Yeah.

36:17.547 --> 36:18.631
-And hurt.
-Yeah. I know.

36:18.714 --> 36:21.172
I'm not worth two hours
in a coach seat?

36:21.255 --> 36:23.506
-You know. All right,
I'm gonna be...
-What?

36:23.589 --> 36:25.756
-I'll just be straight
with you, okay?
-Yeah. That'd be great.

36:25.839 --> 36:28.047
-I've been honest
with you up until now.
-Yes.

36:28.130 --> 36:30.589
-So I'm gonna be honest
with you again.
-Go for it.

36:32.130 --> 36:34.422
I have a bleeding rectum.

36:35.714 --> 36:37.255
They're okay
with you bleeding

36:37.339 --> 36:39.089
out of your rectum
in first class?

36:39.172 --> 36:42.339
It's a more comfortable
place to bleed.

36:42.422 --> 36:44.798
I think it's probably best
that you go.

36:44.881 --> 36:46.756
-What?
-Yeah. Leave the flowers,

36:46.839 --> 36:49.089
but take the ugly balloon,
and just go.

36:50.047 --> 36:51.255
Okay.

36:53.381 --> 36:56.422
-Hey. You gonna eat that Jell-O?
-I'm not gonna eat the Jell-O.

36:57.339 --> 36:58.589
