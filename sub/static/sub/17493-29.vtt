00:02.000 --> 00:03.920
# Sarah and Duck... #
QUACK!

00:03.920 --> 00:05.840
# Sarah and Duck... #
QUACK!

00:07.360 --> 00:09.240
# Sarah and Duck... #
QUACK!

00:11.320 --> 00:12.800
# Sarah and Duck. #
QUACK!

00:15.840 --> 00:19.520
Today, Sarah and Duck are drawing
pictures from a book

00:19.520 --> 00:21.840
all about bricks.

00:21.840 --> 00:25.400
Ooh, THAT'S a good brick.
Good brick.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.040
QUACK, QUACK

00:28.040 --> 00:31.880
They're all houses,
made of bricks, chap.

00:31.880 --> 00:34.160
Like your building blocks.
QUACK

00:34.160 --> 00:35.280
Oh!

00:37.320 --> 00:39.000
Duck, pull, please.

00:41.480 --> 00:44.960
Ooh. They live so high!
QUACK!

00:44.960 --> 00:46.000
Oop!

00:48.800 --> 00:53.680
Ah, a castle.
And look, that's their coat of arms.

00:53.680 --> 00:54.720
Wha?

00:54.720 --> 00:58.680
It's a picture that tells you about
the people who lived in the castle.

00:58.680 --> 01:00.120
Ooh.

01:01.520 --> 01:05.120
Whoa. Big bricks!

01:05.120 --> 01:10.600
You know, I think there might be
a castle not too far from us.

01:10.600 --> 01:13.360
SHE GASPS
We could draw real bricks!

01:13.360 --> 01:14.680
QUACK!

01:20.200 --> 01:22.040
BUS BELL DINGS

01:30.920 --> 01:33.200
Must be at the top of this hill.

01:33.200 --> 01:36.400
Let's go up.
DUCK QUACKS SOFTLY

01:47.160 --> 01:48.840
QUACK, QUACK

01:55.120 --> 01:58.080
SARAH GROANS

01:59.320 --> 02:01.160
Phew!

02:01.160 --> 02:02.760
Wha?
QUACK!

02:02.760 --> 02:06.080
It's all broken. It IS very old.

02:06.080 --> 02:09.040
But there's still
plenty of bricks to draw.

02:09.040 --> 02:10.960
Plenty of bricks.

02:10.960 --> 02:12.880
Come on, Duck.

02:12.880 --> 02:14.480
QUACK

02:17.880 --> 02:20.520
QUACK!

02:20.520 --> 02:22.720
SHE GIGGLES

02:22.720 --> 02:24.040
QUACK, QUACK

02:25.480 --> 02:29.080
Whoa, big brick!

02:29.080 --> 02:32.640
I think that's a stone table. Oh.

02:32.640 --> 02:34.080
OK.

02:35.560 --> 02:36.800
DUCK QUACKS SOFTLY

02:43.040 --> 02:46.600
Ah. Good brick.
BIRD CAWS

02:53.040 --> 02:55.320
QUACK

02:55.320 --> 02:58.760
BIRD CAWS,
DUCK QUACKS

02:58.760 --> 03:01.440
QUACK!
Hey, that's Duck's!

03:03.320 --> 03:04.600
Duck!

03:05.640 --> 03:07.040
Hmm...

03:10.000 --> 03:13.560
Huh. Good drawing, Duck.

03:13.560 --> 03:14.800
Very.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.680
Oh, hang on. It's a rubbing. Huh?

03:19.680 --> 03:22.280
The coins are carved into the stone.

03:22.280 --> 03:26.640
So, when Duck scribbled with the
crayon, it showed up on the paper.

03:26.640 --> 03:29.000
Ohh.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.960
Sorry, Duck.
DUCK QUACKS SOFTLY

03:31.960 --> 03:34.720
Probably means there was
treasure here.

03:34.720 --> 03:37.000
QUACK!
Treasure!

03:37.000 --> 03:39.960
Seems this castle has a few secrets.

03:39.960 --> 03:42.280
Let's find more secrets, Duck.
QUACK!

03:49.560 --> 03:51.240
Ah! There!

04:01.880 --> 04:05.080
A crown! Treasure AND royalty.

04:11.960 --> 04:15.000
SCRIBBLING

04:15.000 --> 04:18.280
Ooh. Paisley fish.

04:28.200 --> 04:29.360
QUACK!

04:36.920 --> 04:40.880
Bread slice? I think
that's just a plain old brick.

04:42.200 --> 04:44.080
No?
QUACK

04:44.080 --> 04:47.760
Right. The expert has spoken. Mm.

04:50.400 --> 04:53.080
Ah!
BIRD CAWS

04:53.080 --> 04:55.040
Oh. Hello.

04:55.040 --> 04:56.320
HE QUACKS SOFTLY

05:03.440 --> 05:07.120
Hmm. Where'd it go?

05:07.120 --> 05:09.280
Oh. Found another one.

05:14.280 --> 05:16.600
What do you suppose that is?

05:16.600 --> 05:19.240
Don't know...
CAW!

05:19.240 --> 05:20.280
Oh!

05:22.520 --> 05:23.760
Come on, Duck.

05:25.960 --> 05:27.040
Ohh!

05:34.320 --> 05:36.280
Wow!

05:36.280 --> 05:40.560
This must have been the great hall.
Lots of bricks.

05:44.520 --> 05:47.880
Erm, Sarah... Yes? Look!

05:47.880 --> 05:49.920
Above the fireplace.

05:49.920 --> 05:52.280
It's the coat of arms.

05:52.280 --> 05:54.080
Whoa!
QUACK

05:58.480 --> 06:02.160
Look, Duck. All the pictures.

06:02.160 --> 06:06.960
And it seems that last symbol was,
in fact, a crow.

06:06.960 --> 06:09.440
CROW CAWS
Like our friend here.

06:09.440 --> 06:12.560
So...this is YOUR castle?

06:12.560 --> 06:14.000
CAW!

06:14.000 --> 06:16.680
Looks like you've found
the castle's treasure, too.

06:17.880 --> 06:21.080
Ooh. Treasure!

06:21.080 --> 06:22.920
SHE GASPS
My crayon!

06:24.440 --> 06:26.120
Ah!

06:34.880 --> 06:37.640
There. What have you drawn?

06:37.640 --> 06:41.640
Ah! Your very own coat of arms.

06:41.640 --> 06:43.800
Uh-huh.
CAW! QUACK!

06:45.440 --> 06:47.280
# Sarah and Duck... #
QUACK!

06:48.960 --> 06:50.800
# Sarah and Duck... #
QUACK!

06:52.440 --> 06:54.280
# Sarah and Duck... #
QUACK!

06:56.280 --> 06:57.560
# Sarah and Duck. #
QUACK!
