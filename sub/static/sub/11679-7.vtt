00:01.101 --> 00:02.762
Myname is Michael Westen.

00:02.836 --> 00:05.498
I used to be a spy until--

00:05.572 --> 00:08.063
- [ Man ] We got a burn notice on you.
You're blacklisted.
- [ Whistles ]

00:08.141 --> 00:10.541
[Michael Narrating]
Whenyou're burned,you've got nothing--

00:10.610 --> 00:13.170
no cash, no credit,
nojob history..

00:13.246 --> 00:16.373
- You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.
- Where am I?

00:16.449 --> 00:18.076
Miam i.

00:18.151 --> 00:20.779
You do whatever work
comes your way.

00:20.854 --> 00:23.516
- You rely on anyone who's still talking to you--
- [ Laughs ]

00:23.590 --> 00:26.457
- a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend--
- Should we shoot them?

00:26.526 --> 00:29.359
an old friend who used to
inform on you to the F.B.I.--

00:29.429 --> 00:31.727
You know spies.
Bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:31.798 --> 00:34.130
- Family too--
- Hey, is that your mom again?

00:34.200 --> 00:36.361
- ifyou're desperate.
- Someone needs your help, Michael.

00:36.436 --> 00:38.904
Bottom line:
Untilyou figure out who burnedyou...

00:40.940 --> 00:42.931
you're not going anywhere.

00:47.380 --> 00:50.110
Your arms dealer friend couldn't
just meet us at the CafÃ© Carlito?

00:50.183 --> 00:51.946
He wanted to meet here.

00:52.018 --> 00:55.385
I bought an assault rifle from him last year.
He doesn't knowyou.

00:55.455 --> 00:58.356
- Seymour has trust issues.
- I don't wanna date him, Fi.

00:58.425 --> 01:02.418
I just wanna find out what the people who
burned me are doing with a Russian sniper rifle.

01:02.495 --> 01:06.397
And Seymour's the perfect guy to track it down.
He's just a little eccentric.

01:06.466 --> 01:08.798
- [ Cell Phone Rings ]
- Oh.

01:11.471 --> 01:14.099
- [ Beeping ]
- [Michael Narrating]
Whenyou work with people...

01:14.174 --> 01:17.234
you wanna know everything
about them--

01:17.310 --> 01:20.939
their history., their associates,
who's contacting them.

01:21.014 --> 01:24.142
- I s that Seymour?
- H m m?

01:24.217 --> 01:26.947
- That-- That Seymour?
- Oh, no. This guy I met.

01:27.020 --> 01:28.954
He just asked me out.

01:29.022 --> 01:32.788
Although sometimes
there are details you'd rather not know.

01:38.832 --> 01:41.858
Fiona, baby.
Good to see you.

01:43.069 --> 01:46.197
Michael, right? Hey, man.

01:46.272 --> 01:48.263
Heard a lot about you.

01:49.542 --> 01:51.669
Come on.
We're going for a walk.

01:53.046 --> 01:56.038
Fiona, keep Jackass company.

01:56.116 --> 01:59.882
He'll likeyou.
He's attracted to shiny objects.

01:59.953 --> 02:02.786
So, Fi tells meyou want a gun.

02:02.856 --> 02:05.051
- Rifle, actually.
- Well, I got plenty. What do you need?

02:05.125 --> 02:09.118
- I got semi, automatic, European.
- I need a Dragunov, actually.

02:09.195 --> 02:12.722
Wow. Yeah, nice gun. Course, there are
not too many ofthem floatin' around.

02:12.799 --> 02:15.029
How about a nice Romanian
P.S.L. instead?

02:15.101 --> 02:17.467
- No. I'm not looking to buy, Seymour--
- Hold that thought.

02:17.537 --> 02:22.065
I got some business I gotta attend to here.
Don't tell me. Don't tell me.

02:22.142 --> 02:25.077
- Vladimir, right?
- Pavel.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.306
Anyway, you got my money?

02:29.215 --> 02:31.911
Uh-uh-uh-uh.
I gotta count it first.

02:39.592 --> 02:42.891
So, what, they don't teach arithmetic
in the Ukraine?

02:42.962 --> 02:46.420
- We're Bulgarian.
- I don't even know whatyou just said.

02:46.499 --> 02:49.024
The deal was 1 00 grand, okay?
Not 50.

02:49.102 --> 02:52.833
Areyou trying to rip me off?
Nobody rips me off.

02:56.342 --> 02:59.778
- Fiona saidyou were badass.
- This is really none of my business.

02:59.846 --> 03:03.839
Well, it is now.
And this is the part where we haul ass.

03:03.917 --> 03:06.681
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Okay.

03:10.290 --> 03:12.781
All right.
So we'll talk later, okay?

03:12.859 --> 03:16.522
Let's go,Jackass! Punch it, man!

[Michael Narrating]
Ifyou're driving a sports coupe...

03:29.809 --> 03:32.369
you're not going to be able
to lose an off-road vehicle off-road.

03:32.445 --> 03:37.144
Your best bet is to get them on the road,
where you have the advantage.

[ Horn Honki ng ]

03:41.788 --> 03:44.780
[ Horn Honki ng ]

03:44.857 --> 03:48.793
It's less about speed
than it is about maneuverability.

03:48.861 --> 03:53.958
You need to putyourselfin a position
where you can do something they can't.

04:10.850 --> 04:14.752
[ Chuckling ] Okay then, what about Gerta
from East Berlin? You remember her?

04:14.821 --> 04:19.019
You kiddi n'? I wanted to i nvade
the Soviet bloc i n 1 983 just for her.

04:19.091 --> 04:23.051
- Nice.
- [ Both Laughing ]

04:23.129 --> 04:25.689
Hey, Mike.
You remember Virgil.

04:25.765 --> 04:27.756
Mike!

04:29.302 --> 04:31.998
I brought us some tall, cool ones.

04:32.071 --> 04:34.562
I seem to recall you promising
to stay out of Miami.

04:34.641 --> 04:38.873
Last time Isawyou, there were people
looking foryou-- angry.people, with guns.

04:38.945 --> 04:41.209
That's-- That's all blown over.

04:41.281 --> 04:44.512
I was planning on staying away, but--

04:44.584 --> 04:46.211
He needs help, Mike.

04:46.286 --> 04:48.220
Not for myself.

04:48.288 --> 04:50.222
I had a partner in the repo business.

04:50.290 --> 04:53.316

04:57.697 --> 05:00.393
They got hit hard.
Big shipment ofmedicine got ripped off.

05:00.466 --> 05:02.957
Virgil's trying to track it down.
He needs some backup.

05:03.036 --> 05:05.698
- Backup?
- I figured that was in your wheelhouse.

05:05.772 --> 05:08.570
- She doesn't have anywhere else to turn.
- Can't hurt to talk to her.

05:08.641 --> 05:10.905
It could.
It could hurt a little. Could hurt a lot.

05:10.977 --> 05:14.640
Come on. Gathering intel, lending
tacticalsupport to a worthwhile mission?

05:14.714 --> 05:19.879
I mean, this is our old gig, Mike.
This is why we signed up back in the day.

05:19.952 --> 05:21.943
Fine, I'll talk to her.

05:22.021 --> 05:24.182
All right!

05:24.257 --> 05:26.555
Oh, mind if I useyour phone?
I need to call Madeline.

05:26.626 --> 05:29.527
- [Beeping]
-Yeah, about that.

05:29.595 --> 05:33.463
Special lady. There's a magnetic thing
about her. Irresistible.

05:33.533 --> 05:36.331
She offered to put me up,
so I need to get on over there--

05:36.402 --> 05:39.565
You'll stay here.
You tell heryou can't make it...

05:39.639 --> 05:42.574
and you'll call herwhen
you're back in the Bahamas.

05:45.611 --> 05:47.636
Mike, you serious?

05:47.714 --> 05:50.274
Last timeyou were in town,
you nearly got her killed.

05:51.584 --> 05:53.415
That's not going to happen again.

05:55.054 --> 05:57.181
Okay.

05:58.558 --> 06:01.550
Mike, I'm tellingyou,
you're not gonna regret this.

06:01.627 --> 06:03.788
Marcela's done great things
with this clinic.

06:03.863 --> 06:07.697
They send medicine to kids in every country
of the world that has diseases.

06:07.767 --> 06:09.632
- [Boy] Hey!

Hey! No ball on the sidewalk.

06:16.075 --> 06:19.044
- He started it.
- I see you brought the cavalry.

06:21.581 --> 06:24.607
Listen, if anyone can find
this stuff, it's these two.

06:24.684 --> 06:28.950
- We really need your help.
- Why don't you start by telling us
what we're looking for.

06:29.021 --> 06:31.956
We spent months on a fund-raiser
for kids in Rio--

06:32.024 --> 06:34.993
shipped nearly a million
dollars worth of medicine.

06:35.061 --> 06:37.222
Yesterday,
an hour out of Miami...

06:37.296 --> 06:41.323
these guys boarded
the freighter, took everything.

06:41.401 --> 06:45.531
Well, unless they're starting a medical clinic,
they're gonna wanna sell this stuff.

06:45.605 --> 06:48.199
Whatever this stuffis worth
on the black market...

06:48.274 --> 06:50.799
it's nothing compared to
what it means to those kids.

06:50.877 --> 06:54.574
- Ifyou can bring it back--
- We'll see what we can do.

06:54.647 --> 06:56.638

? Willie, bounce with me ?

06:56.716 --> 06:59.344
? Willie, bounce with me ??

06:59.419 --> 07:02.820
Thankyou so much, Michael. I've been meaning
to move these out here for ages.

07:02.889 --> 07:06.347
Any particular reason why
you had to do everythi ng today?

07:06.426 --> 07:09.793
Uh, just spring cleaning, you know.

07:09.862 --> 07:14.265
- So, have you heard from Virgil?
- Virgil?

07:14.333 --> 07:18.167
Yeah, he called and said that, um,
he was coming to town to seeyou and Sam.

07:18.237 --> 07:21.297
Well, you know Virgil.
Just being Virgil.

07:23.176 --> 07:25.542
[Cell Phone Rings ]

07:25.611 --> 07:30.412
- Yeah, I gotta--Yeah?
- [ Sam ] Mikey, good news.
We gotta head up to Boca.

07:30.483 --> 07:33.975
Got a lead on a guywho deals in black-market
pharmaceuticals. That could be ourway in.

07:34.053 --> 07:36.283
I was thinking we could
head up there and check it out.

07:36.355 --> 07:38.186
Just the two of us?

07:38.257 --> 07:42.284
Yeah, yeah. Virgil's gonna see
some friends while he's here in town.

07:42.361 --> 07:44.295
Friends. Uh-huh.

07:44.363 --> 07:48.959
Yeah, I think it'd be better
if I went with him to Boca.

07:49.035 --> 07:53.267
Okay, sure, that's a good idea. It'd be good
foryou guys to have some bonding time.

07:53.339 --> 07:56.604
Uh, listen, Virgil needs
to askyou just a little favor.

07:56.676 --> 07:59.110
Listen, I didn't
pack enough underwear...

07:59.178 --> 08:02.944
so I borrowed a set ofyour boxers--
the blue ones with the stripes.

08:03.015 --> 08:06.109
Theywill never fityou.
Stay out of my closets.

08:06.185 --> 08:08.779
They're a little snug down under,
but I got it all packed in.

Appreciate it.
Thankyou.

didn't have to see that.

Someone staying in the loft?

08:18.731 --> 08:21.928
Yeah, good old Sam,
back at the loft.

08:23.302 --> 08:26.237
- You don't say?
- Yeah, I'm gonna go, Mom.

08:41.087 --> 08:44.113
[Virgil] Thatstore there?
It's ownedbya guynamed Feldman.

08:44.190 --> 08:46.920
Last few years, a bunch of ships
have been robbed the same way.

08:46.993 --> 08:49.120
Thieves are in and out
in five minutes.

08:49.195 --> 08:52.858
- They like to hit pharmaceutical shipments.
- And this guy likes to buy them.

08:52.932 --> 08:55.366
Well, he's a one-man pharmacy.

08:55.434 --> 08:59.530
He got caught some time ago
for selling Vicodin taken offsome boat in Naples.

08:59.605 --> 09:03.006
Charged with receiving stolen property,
but his lawyer got him off.

09:03.075 --> 09:06.670
Doing a pretty brisk
business now, it appears.

09:06.746 --> 09:08.839
[Shutter Clicks ]

09:14.120 --> 09:17.783
Um, Michael, this thing
with your mama and me...

09:17.857 --> 09:20.553
- I know you're a little uncomfortable about it--
- I'm not uncomfortable.

09:20.626 --> 09:24.528
- You attract bullets. It's too risky.
- Come on. What's a few bullets?

09:24.597 --> 09:27.589
Uh,you know what?
I've got enough here.

09:27.667 --> 09:31.899
I'll run down to the photo store
and you can run in and raise a little hell.

09:36.642 --> 09:39.907
Can I help you?

09:39.979 --> 09:43.415
My friend here is looking for a 5-iron,
graphite shaft, nothing too heavy.

09:43.482 --> 09:45.848
And a million dollars' worth
ofhigh-grade pharmaceuticals...

09:45.918 --> 09:48.148
stolen offa freighter
a couple of days ago.

09:48.220 --> 09:51.747
Excuse me? I sell golf equipment.
I don't know whatyou're talking about.

09:51.824 --> 09:54.156
Really? I mean,
this is nice golf equipment...

09:54.226 --> 09:56.717
but this store isn't paying
for that Porsche out back.

09:56.796 --> 09:58.821
Youaresellingsomething else.

10:02.768 --> 10:06.169
- Hey, hey--
- Oh, would you look at this?

10:06.238 --> 10:09.401
- Who areyou? What is this?
- Quite a clientele--

10:09.475 --> 10:11.500
banker, superior court judge.

10:11.577 --> 10:15.172
We thought we'd mail everybody a copy
of their photo coming out ofthis store...

10:15.247 --> 10:17.181
in one ofthese lovely,
handsome frames.

10:17.249 --> 10:19.513
All right.Just stop it.
This guy came by.

10:19.585 --> 10:22.816
Isell Viagra, Vicodin and tranqs.

10:22.888 --> 10:25.379
What am I gonna do with
a million dollars worth of antivirals?

10:25.458 --> 10:28.757
- Who is this guy, anyway?
- His name's Gerard. He's a total psycho.

10:28.828 --> 10:32.093
You are gonna call Gerard. You are going
to tell him you have a buyer for his drugs.

10:32.164 --> 10:35.224
No, no, that's insane.
I can't-- I can't call him.

10:35.301 --> 10:39.294
What will the neighbors think?
They've been living next to a drug dealer!

10:39.372 --> 10:41.135
- Shh, shh!
- He seemed so nice.

10:41.207 --> 10:45.940
All right, all right.
I'll getyou a meeting.

10:46.012 --> 10:50.949
- And, uh, throw in one ofthose shirts.
- Yeah, sure.

10:51.017 --> 10:54.316
Well, it sounds likeyou and Virg
made some progress. You found our thief.

10:54.387 --> 10:56.321
Yeah, I'm told he's a total psycho.

10:56.389 --> 10:59.722
You know, this is the reason
why I don't look forward to Virgil's visits.

10:59.792 --> 11:02.124
- [ Snoring ]
- One ofthe reasons.

11:02.194 --> 11:05.459
Listen, we're in the homestretch here.
We just gotta get the medicine out in the open.

11:05.531 --> 11:08.091
Look, I'll run point, okay?
I'll go in as a buyer.

11:08.167 --> 11:11.933
- Fine. The soonerwe get this done--
- I'm all over it, Mikey.

11:12.004 --> 11:15.269
Soyou gonna hook up with Fi's arms
dealer friend? How's that going?

11:15.341 --> 11:17.366
Yeah, another total psycho.

11:28.621 --> 11:31.852
Seymour, you might have mentioned
we were going to a gun buy.

11:31.924 --> 11:35.189
Look, that jackass I call
a bodyguard is worthless...

11:35.261 --> 11:38.526
so I figured you come along as backup,
and I know for sureyou're not a cop.

11:38.597 --> 11:41.361
See?
Kill two birds, right?

11:41.434 --> 11:44.460
- Whoa, whoa. What's this?
- You said you wanted a gun.

11:44.537 --> 11:47.370
No, no, no, I wanted information
about a sniper rifle.

11:47.440 --> 11:50.341
Oh, right.
The Dragunov.

11:50.409 --> 11:54.038
I mean, I could maybe import one
from this guy in the Czech Republic.

11:54.113 --> 11:57.173
No, I'm not looking to buy
a sniper rifle, Seymour.

11:57.249 --> 12:01.345
Ijust need to track down a place
where someone can calibrate it.

12:03.422 --> 12:06.880
- Do me a favor. Wave at that guy.
- [ Groans ]

12:06.959 --> 12:11.623
Uh, ifI'm not mistaken,
that's one ofthe guys who shot at us.

12:11.697 --> 12:14.359
He is bringing the rest
of the money, see? Fifty G's.

12:14.433 --> 12:18.028
- And why would I wave at him?
- I told him you and me don't have
a beefwith him anymore.

12:18.104 --> 12:21.130
We--We, Seymour,

26:42.263 --> 26:45.994
Fill some vials with
your choice ofbeverage.

The trick is to keep people

from your local farming supply store...

26:52.574 --> 26:55.600

I told you. The guy on the boat will recognize
me if I don't get a mask. So I need a mask.

He can tell it to the fishes.

27:37.652 --> 27:40.246
Dealing with criminals,
on the other hand...

I knew people were gonna be shot.

27:52.333 --> 27:54.392
And ifyou're gonna shoot people,
they're gonna shoot back.

27:54.469 --> 27:57.233
And ifthey shoot back, they'll probably hit me.
So I need a gun.

[Michael Narrating] Using a Zodiac
to catch ayacht has certain advantages.

28:08.249 --> 28:10.740
It's low to the water,

28:10.818 --> 28:14.185

a brisk 60 miles per hour...

38:55.794 --> 38:58.957
You can make it up
to me over dinner.

39:00.331 --> 39:03.061
Take hersomeplace nice.
No guns.

39:03.134 --> 39:06.069
You got it.
[ Laughs ]

39:06.137 --> 39:09.766
[ Chuckles ]

39:09.841 --> 39:14.437
You know, Mike, ifyou had to have
a stepdad,you could do worse.

39:21.052 --> 39:24.249
- Seymour has our information?
- He didn't say.

39:24.322 --> 39:29.282
J ust wanted us to stop by his place.
He sounded more paranoid than normal.

39:29.360 --> 39:32.454
- You missing a date for this?
- Oh, don't flatteryourself.

39:32.530 --> 39:35.397
Seymour promised to upgrade
my laser targeting assist.

39:35.467 --> 39:38.436
- [Bell Ringing]
- Said I could pick it up tonight. Should be quick.

39:38.503 --> 39:41.870
I have no intention
of missing any more dates.

39:41.940 --> 39:44.238
You look beautiful, Fi.

39:53.184 --> 39:55.175
[DoorCloses ]

39:57.922 --> 40:01.585
So this guy, is he nice?
Your date?

40:01.659 --> 40:05.652
Yeah, very.
He's a paramedic.

40:05.730 --> 40:08.494
- I thinkyou'd like him.
- Yeah, I wouldn't count on it.

40:08.566 --> 40:11.296
- [ Groans ]
- [ Gasps ]

40:11.369 --> 40:13.803
What the hell did
you get me into?

40:13.872 --> 40:17.000
- I was wondering the same thing.
- Who the hell areyou, huh?

40:17.075 --> 40:20.806
Why doyou keep asking me
about that sniper rifle?

40:20.879 --> 40:24.212
You start answering questions,
oryour girlfriend gets a bullet in the head.

40:24.282 --> 40:27.149
I'm not his girlfriend.

40:27.218 --> 40:29.083
[Michael Narrating]
Anyone who playedsoccer...

40:29.154 --> 40:31.679
knows there's a long nerve
that runs down the shin.

40:31.756 --> 40:35.556
Hit that nerve
and people lock up in pain.

40:35.627 --> 40:37.492
[ Screams ]

40:40.665 --> 40:45.227
Arms dealers keep gunpowder handy
to manufacture custom-made rounds...

40:45.303 --> 40:48.704
but gunpowder doesn't need to be
in a bullet to be dangerous.

40:48.773 --> 40:53.403
Even muzzle flare can set it off.
So when dispersed through a room...

40:53.478 --> 40:55.844
anyone with halfa brain
puts his gun away.

40:55.914 --> 40:59.042
No, no, no, no, no! J ackass, don't shoot!
You'l I blow us all up!

41:01.953 --> 41:04.080
- [ Groans ]
- [ Grunts ]

41:04.155 --> 41:07.283
Seymour! You wanna tell me
what that was about?

41:07.358 --> 41:09.121
[Seymour]
Dude, look.

41:09.194 --> 41:12.789
I tracked down a shop that had done some work
on the gun you're asking about.

41:12.864 --> 41:14.889
The place was burned
to the ground, man.

41:14.966 --> 41:19.699
They killed the guywho owned it.
I thoughtyou were setting me up for something.

41:19.771 --> 41:23.229
- Who brought the gun in, Seymour?
- I don't know.

41:23.308 --> 41:25.276
No, I swear, I swear!

41:25.343 --> 41:30.280
All I know is some guy picked up
some stufffor it, okay? [ Spitting ]

41:30.348 --> 41:34.751
Specially calibrated muzzle brakes,
night sights and a fiber optic camera.

41:34.819 --> 41:37.287
[Spits ]
That's all I know!

41:37.355 --> 41:39.846
Who's the guy?
What's his name?

41:39.924 --> 41:42.154
They said his name
was Bill Johnson, okay?

41:42.227 --> 41:44.957
That's all I know, I swear.
Please don't hurt me.

41:46.397 --> 41:48.592
Fi.

41:48.666 --> 41:51.066
We were never here.
You understand?

41:51.135 --> 41:54.434
I got it. Never sawyou.
[ Spits ]

41:55.807 --> 41:58.173
- Sorry about the dress, Fi.
- I'm not.

41:58.243 --> 42:02.009
I got this baby
with laser targeting assist.

42:02.080 --> 42:04.674
You thinkJohnson has something
to do with the people who burned you?

42:04.749 --> 42:07.718
Have to assume so. He's putting
a fiber optic camera on a sniper rifle.

42:07.785 --> 42:10.310
That's for proof of death.
We'd better find this guy.

42:10.388 --> 42:13.289
Now we've got his name,
but he could be anywhere.
