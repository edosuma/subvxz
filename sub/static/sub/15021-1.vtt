00:54.000 --> 00:57.130
<i>Ever since I can remember,
I've wanted to be clever.</i>

00:57.210 --> 01:01.470
<i>Some people are born clever the same
way some people are born beautiful.</i>

01:02.200 --> 01:05.459
<i>I'm not one of those people.
I've had to work at it.</i>

01:05.640 --> 01:09.420
<i>If there's a question, I
have to know the right answer.</i>

01:09.510 --> 01:13.070
<i>Crystalline or glassy in appearance, which
of the three principal classes of rock</i>

01:13.160 --> 01:15.150
<i>is formed by the cooling
of molten earth material?</i>

01:15.250 --> 01:16.510
What do you reckon, Brian?

01:17.190 --> 01:18.370
Volcanic.

01:18.450 --> 01:20.020
<i>- Is it igneous?
- Igneous is correct.</i>

01:21.590 --> 01:23.060
That was nearly right.

01:24.410 --> 01:26.580
<i>Derived from the Greek
words for wing and finger,</i>

01:26.710 --> 01:30.230
<i>what name is given to a flying lizard
of the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods?</i>

01:30.360 --> 01:31.500
Pterodactyl.

01:31.580 --> 01:33.480
<i>- Cronin, Oxford.
- Is it a Pterodactyl?</i>

01:33.580 --> 01:35.530
<i>- Pterodactyl is correct.
- Yes!</i>

01:35.960 --> 01:37.750
Clever little thing, aren't you?

01:40.880 --> 01:44.610
<i>As Francis Bacon once
said, knowledge is power.</i>

01:44.700 --> 01:47.950
<i>Which is why I want to know everything.</i>

01:48.470 --> 01:53.040
<i>I want to know about Plato and
Newton, Tolstoy and Bob Dylan.</i>

01:53.260 --> 01:56.080
<i>What the words "dialectic"
and "peripatetic" mean.</i>

01:56.600 --> 02:00.260
<i>I want to know why
people actually like jazz.</i>

02:00.340 --> 02:02.200
<i>If I'm going to find the answers,</i>

02:02.200 --> 02:05.560
<i>I need to be in a place where
people have a passion for knowledge,</i>

02:05.770 --> 02:08.900
<i>think it's important. Sacred, even.</i>

02:08.990 --> 02:13.770
That's why I hope you'll accept
my application to this university.

02:22.540 --> 02:25.240
So, was that the correct answer?

02:27.540 --> 02:31.800
Well, it's not really a question of correct
or incorrect, but it's certainly been...

02:33.060 --> 02:34.320
entertaining.

02:39.700 --> 02:40.960
I think that's everything, Brian.

02:46.270 --> 02:47.430
Thank you.

02:54.300 --> 02:56.170
We'll see you in October, Mr Jackson.

02:57.640 --> 02:58.780
Yes!

02:59.000 --> 03:01.460
<i>So this is it. I made it.</i>

03:02.120 --> 03:04.600
<i>Of course, there are going
to be some pretty big changes.</i>

03:04.730 --> 03:08.770
<i>Leaving home, moving to a new city
away from people I've known all my life</i>

03:08.900 --> 03:11.680
<i>and friends who've always supported me.</i>

03:12.030 --> 03:13.990
You're not gonna turn
into a wanker, are you?

03:14.290 --> 03:15.330
What?

03:15.450 --> 03:18.450
I mean, you're not gonna get all
poncey, start saying, "One does"

03:18.590 --> 03:20.020
and wearing a cloak and talking Latin.

03:20.150 --> 03:22.540
Yes, Tone. That's exactly
what's gonna happen.

03:23.800 --> 03:25.540
- Let's get out of here.
- All right.

03:38.570 --> 03:40.130
Oi, slow down.

03:50.350 --> 03:52.000
Why do we always have to listen to this?

03:52.000 --> 03:54.300
- Because...
- Because what?

03:54.300 --> 03:56.600
- 'Cause it's MotÃ¶rhead.
- And?

03:56.820 --> 03:58.480
And the Head rule.

03:58.480 --> 04:00.120
Because you say so?

04:00.260 --> 04:02.120
'Cause it's my ghetto blaster.

04:02.200 --> 04:04.940
- Which ghetto is that, then, Tone?
- It's Westcliff on Sea.

04:05.030 --> 04:06.160
Yeah, good one, Bri.

04:06.290 --> 04:08.990
Tell you what, why don't you
stick on a bit of Kate Bush, yeah?

04:09.110 --> 04:11.290
We'll have a really good dance,
listening to Kate Bush, yeah?

04:11.370 --> 04:14.810
We'll have a really good time, we'll listen
to Kate Bush, have a great dance, yeah?

04:16.070 --> 04:17.630
Bloody hell, Spencer!

04:28.140 --> 04:29.920
I did this for you.

04:30.970 --> 04:34.310
Trick your new mates into
thinking you got some taste.

04:34.320 --> 04:37.750
Cheers, Spence. That's amazing.

04:37.830 --> 04:41.390
It's only a tape, bro. There's
no need to get all gay about it.

04:41.390 --> 04:44.740
So, you think you will
retake your exams or...

04:44.830 --> 04:46.480
- Oh, don't start.
- Start what?

04:46.610 --> 04:48.480
The careers guidance.

04:48.690 --> 04:51.390
- I think it's a waste, that's all.
- Fuck off, it's waste.

04:51.390 --> 04:53.910
Sitting on your arse for three
years reading poems, that's a waste.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.080
It's not just about that.

04:56.380 --> 04:58.040
It's about life experience.

04:58.160 --> 05:00.990
Expanding your mind, grappling
with the big questions.

05:01.080 --> 05:04.290
- Making exciting new friends.
- As opposed to boring old ones?

05:05.550 --> 05:09.420
- I didn't say that, did I?
- I'm fine as I am, thanks, Brian.

05:10.150 --> 05:13.980
Besides, there's always Tone to
debate the weighty issues of the day.

05:14.110 --> 05:16.500
Never get that again. Thanks, mate.

05:18.070 --> 05:19.930
- Best tape I ever made...
- Let's get him.

05:20.020 --> 05:22.760
...in the sea. What?

05:22.840 --> 05:25.140
No. Hang on. What...

05:25.240 --> 05:27.620
- Let's get him!
- Right!

05:27.760 --> 05:29.180
That's it!

05:29.320 --> 05:30.360
Spencer! Take it easy.

05:55.780 --> 05:58.470
- Is that what you're wearing?
- You don't mind, do you?

05:58.470 --> 06:00.640
No. No, no, of course not.

06:00.990 --> 06:03.470
No, it's very smart.

06:05.330 --> 06:07.950
- Now, bread, do you need bread?
- I'll get bread there.

06:08.070 --> 06:10.770
- Chip pan?
- I'll miss the train, Mum.

06:10.850 --> 06:12.720
- Don't drink too much.
- I won't if you won't.

06:12.850 --> 06:14.630
And don't be cheeky.

06:15.150 --> 06:17.850
Now, you sure you don't want
me to walk you to the station?

06:17.850 --> 06:20.020
Mum, I'm all right. Honestly.

06:21.360 --> 06:22.840
- Here, take this.
- No.

06:22.940 --> 06:25.760
- No, you can't afford it, Mum.
- Just take it.

06:25.880 --> 06:29.320
Try to eat a piece of fresh
fruit every now and then.

06:32.230 --> 06:34.620
He'd have been so proud of you.

08:13.290 --> 08:14.420
Yes!

08:15.980 --> 08:17.420
Take that!

08:20.540 --> 08:24.620
Hi there. I'm your
housemate, Brian Jackson.

08:25.540 --> 08:27.020
Hello, Brian Jackson.

08:27.100 --> 08:29.320
- I'm Josh, this is Marcus.
- Hello.

08:30.580 --> 08:31.710
Hello.

08:32.450 --> 08:34.610
Want me to show you to your quarters?

08:35.350 --> 08:36.390
Yeah.

08:40.870 --> 08:43.570
Hope you don't mind but
we allocated the rooms.

08:45.040 --> 08:47.650
- Bit small, isn't it?
- Yes.

08:47.740 --> 08:49.220
Yes, it is.

08:50.120 --> 08:52.220
Well, we'll leave you to get
ready for the party, then.

08:52.340 --> 08:53.480
Party?

08:53.690 --> 08:55.340
Tarts and vicars.

08:55.860 --> 08:57.430
You are coming?

08:58.250 --> 08:59.810
Oh, actually.

09:01.510 --> 09:03.910
I think I'm gonna stay here.

09:04.290 --> 09:07.030
Unpack and do some reading.

09:20.460 --> 09:23.970
Right. I'll purchase
the alcoholic beverages.

09:24.100 --> 09:26.280
You got any money, Barry?

09:27.010 --> 09:30.360
Any cash? It's just, I
don't have any pockets.

09:32.450 --> 09:33.670
Okay.

09:35.230 --> 09:37.310
- Cheers,
squire. - Ta-ta.

09:52.220 --> 09:55.040
- I just got back from India.
- Oh, right.

09:55.260 --> 09:57.210
Amazing experience.

09:57.650 --> 10:01.290
Transformed me in ways I
never could have imagined.

10:02.210 --> 10:03.470
Such as?

10:03.590 --> 10:05.470
Do you use toilet paper?

10:05.550 --> 10:07.330
Well, now and then.

10:08.900 --> 10:10.850
Not cool, you know.

10:10.980 --> 10:13.280
Terrible for the environment.

10:13.590 --> 10:14.720
So...

10:17.940 --> 10:19.620
how do you... you know?

10:19.720 --> 10:21.800
I use my hand,

10:22.240 --> 10:24.190
and a bucket of water.

10:24.320 --> 10:26.410
You should try it sometime.

10:26.490 --> 10:28.490
Sorry, I've just seen somebody I know.

10:28.580 --> 10:29.930
All right.

10:30.450 --> 10:33.490
Hi. Do you mind if I
pretend to know you.

10:33.570 --> 10:35.870
Has he been asking
you about toilet paper?

10:36.490 --> 10:38.270
It's uncool, apparently.

10:38.350 --> 10:40.960
Yeah, well, so is gastroenteritis.

10:45.130 --> 10:47.860
The ironic thing is,
I actually am a vicar.

10:50.960 --> 10:52.950
So what'd you come as?

10:53.390 --> 10:54.950
A normal person.

10:55.040 --> 10:56.600
You could at least have come as a vicar.

10:56.600 --> 10:58.910
- Except I'm Jewish.
- Really?

10:58.990 --> 11:01.370
Wow. I've never met a Jew before.

11:01.510 --> 11:03.160
Not properly, anyway.

11:03.250 --> 11:06.210
Which is strange, really, because
loads of my heroes are Jewish.

11:06.290 --> 11:09.290
Woody Allen, Marx,
Einstein, Dustin Hoffman.

11:09.420 --> 11:11.900
- Jesus.
- Jesus, Freud, Kubrick.

11:12.020 --> 11:15.370
Yeah. God, there certainly
have been some amazing Jews.

11:15.760 --> 11:17.620
My people thank you.

11:21.190 --> 11:24.710
- Here you go, squire.
- Don't waste any time, do you, Barry?

11:24.840 --> 11:26.270
Nice work, Barry.

11:26.410 --> 11:28.150
Was there any change?

11:28.270 --> 11:29.530
Sorry.

11:30.570 --> 11:34.830
Well, nice talking to you, Barry.

11:35.230 --> 11:36.920
Actually, it's Brian.

11:38.050 --> 11:41.090
- But he just called you Barry.
- Yeah, he did.

11:41.180 --> 11:43.480
What, you didn't correct him?

11:43.700 --> 11:46.080
I'm sorry, I didn't get your name.

11:46.180 --> 11:48.260
Rebecca. Rebecca Epstein.

11:48.560 --> 11:50.480
Rebecca Epstein.

11:50.560 --> 11:52.860
That's a Jewish name, isn't it?

11:53.260 --> 11:55.040
<i>Shalom, Brian.</i>

11:55.130 --> 11:56.910
Right, absolutely.

13:18.890 --> 13:20.150
Bring it on!

13:50.040 --> 13:51.170
I'm sorry.

13:53.470 --> 13:56.390
Oh, excuse me. What's the hurry?

13:57.650 --> 13:59.730
- Rebecca.
- Right.

13:59.730 --> 14:01.160
Come to our demonstration.

14:01.290 --> 14:02.860
Can't stop. I've got
an important meeting.

14:02.950 --> 14:05.550
Oh, right. More important than
the struggle against apartheid?

14:05.680 --> 14:09.120
Listen, I'm really, really interested
in this. It's just that I'm late.

14:09.120 --> 14:10.540
Yeah, I know.

14:10.680 --> 14:12.940
Contemporary Jewish studies.

14:16.200 --> 14:17.630
Oh, sorry.

14:21.410 --> 14:22.630
Halt.

14:22.840 --> 14:25.370
- Hi, I'm here for the...
- Fingers on buzzers, first question.

14:25.370 --> 14:26.930
- What's that in your hand?
- It's a poster.

14:27.010 --> 14:28.880
And why is it in your hand
rather than on the wall

14:28.890 --> 14:30.450
where everyone can see it?

14:30.570 --> 14:33.180
Never mind. Fill this in, will you?

14:33.270 --> 14:35.440
- Anyone else waiting out there?
- I don't think so. No.

14:35.570 --> 14:37.140
Really? Bugger.

14:38.260 --> 14:40.560
- Subject?
- English literature.

14:41.300 --> 14:43.700
But I'm pretty good on sciences.

14:43.780 --> 14:45.650
Newton's Third Law of Motion?

14:45.780 --> 14:48.690
Reaction is equal and
opposite to action.

14:51.170 --> 14:53.080
Take a seat, please.

14:56.600 --> 14:57.860
Anywhere?

15:02.120 --> 15:04.940
Right. Let's get started then, shall we?

15:05.550 --> 15:07.020
I'm sorry there aren't more of us.

15:07.120 --> 15:10.240
It seems that vandals have
been tearing down the posters.

15:11.800 --> 15:13.800
I'm Patrick Watts
from Ashton-under-Lyne.

15:13.890 --> 15:15.890
I'm reading mechanical engineering.

15:16.060 --> 15:19.490
Some of you may recognise me
from last year's TV tournament.

15:23.060 --> 15:25.050
Once again I'll be
captaining this year's team.

15:25.150 --> 15:26.630
- Why?
- Sorry?

15:26.710 --> 15:29.920
If we lost last year, why
are you still the captain?

15:31.100 --> 15:34.220
Well, because I'm a post-grad and I've
been captain for the last three years.

15:34.310 --> 15:35.790
Yeah, we've lost for
the last three years.

15:35.880 --> 15:38.480
Look, let's just crack on, shall we?

15:41.610 --> 15:44.440
In order to qualify, you'll need to
answer 30 questions in 30 minutes.

15:44.520 --> 15:48.690
And the top three scores join me,
the captain, in this year's team.

15:49.300 --> 15:51.390
I have some lively
little questions in there,

15:51.390 --> 15:53.610
so I think you're in
for a pretty good time.

15:53.690 --> 15:56.600
But it is against the clock.
So, people, if you're ready.

15:57.860 --> 15:59.290
Let's quiz!

16:11.200 --> 16:12.240
Hi.

16:14.410 --> 16:17.240
- Sorry, I'm late.
- That's fine.

16:22.530 --> 16:24.110
- Can I borrow this?
- Of course you can.

16:24.190 --> 16:25.580
Thank you.

16:50.870 --> 16:54.210
<i>Okay, concentrate. Question six.</i>

16:54.950 --> 16:56.690
<i>Question six is...</i>

16:57.860 --> 16:59.510
<i>Why's she smiling at me?</i>

16:59.640 --> 17:02.030
<i>That's not question six. Concentrate.</i>

17:02.030 --> 17:03.770
<i>Must concentrate.</i>

17:04.290 --> 17:06.810
<i>Look at the paper. Look at the paper.</i>

17:06.900 --> 17:08.680
<i>Don't look at her.</i>

17:09.720 --> 17:11.200
<i>Don't look at her legs,</i>

17:12.940 --> 17:15.020
<i>or the curve of her neck.</i>

17:15.150 --> 17:18.369
<i>Just concentrate. Right. Question sex...</i>

17:19.020 --> 17:20.369
<i>Six. Six.</i>

17:40.780 --> 17:42.350
<i>Hey, handsome.</i>

17:43.480 --> 17:46.520
<i>Would you mind giving me the
answers to three and five?</i>

17:47.430 --> 17:48.690
<i>Thanks.</i>

17:50.990 --> 17:52.210
<i>Cheating.</i>

17:52.430 --> 17:55.250
<i>She wants me to cheat. I can't do that.</i>

17:57.550 --> 18:01.600
<i>With pleasure. Three is
potassium permanganate,</i>

18:02.120 --> 18:04.420
<i>and five is Papua New Guinea.</i>

18:51.390 --> 18:53.910
Support our nurses. Support our nurses.

18:57.560 --> 18:59.940
Brian, can I help you? I'm
here for the team meeting.

19:00.030 --> 19:03.460
- Alice. Hello. Come in.
- Hi.

19:03.460 --> 19:06.600
Brian, you're not on the
team. Alice here beat you.

19:06.720 --> 19:09.850
- Only by one point.
- Well, even so, Brian's still the loser.

19:09.940 --> 19:12.330
Well, loser's a strong word.

19:12.460 --> 19:14.500
He is first reserve.

19:15.760 --> 19:18.070
Shoes off, please. Follow me.

19:19.110 --> 19:20.970
Brian, I am so sorry.

19:21.270 --> 19:23.670
If you hadn't given me those
answers, you'd have been on the team.

19:23.800 --> 19:25.880
Alice, it's no big deal.

19:26.920 --> 19:28.060
- Really?
- Yeah.

19:28.180 --> 19:30.440
All right, but I owe you.

19:42.130 --> 19:43.690
<i>Watts, Bristol.</i>

19:45.570 --> 19:47.570
<i>Sorry, going to have to hurry you.</i>

19:49.430 --> 19:50.560
<i>Is it...</i>

19:50.650 --> 19:53.080
<i>Schubert, Death and
the Maiden. Schubert!</i>

19:55.770 --> 19:56.820
<i>Tchaikovsky?</i>

19:56.900 --> 19:58.990
<i>No, I'm afraid that's not
the correct answer. Anyone?</i>

19:59.120 --> 20:01.380
<i>- Salmon, Queens.
- Schubert, Death and the Maiden.</i>

20:01.500 --> 20:03.600
<i>Is correct. That's
the sound of the gong.</i>

20:03.680 --> 20:07.110
<i>The winners of this year's grand
final are Queens' College, Cambridge.</i>

20:19.410 --> 20:22.970
Obviously, I take no pleasure
in showing that to you.

20:24.100 --> 20:26.710
But, as someone once
wrote, "To err is human."

20:26.800 --> 20:27.840
Anyone?

20:27.970 --> 20:30.140
<i>Alexander Pope's Essay On Man?</i>

20:30.270 --> 20:32.740
And, you know, I really
feel that with dedication

20:32.840 --> 20:35.960
and good old-fashioned teamwork,
that this could be our year.

20:36.090 --> 20:40.260
Which is why we're all assembled here
today. The Fantastic Four, if you will.

20:40.440 --> 20:43.690
Each with his or her own special powers.

20:43.790 --> 20:45.650
Colin, history, politics.

20:45.790 --> 20:47.870
Lucy, science, medicine.

20:47.950 --> 20:50.250
Alice, art and literature.

20:51.390 --> 20:55.160
And myself as a sort of
floating Renaissance man.

20:55.780 --> 20:58.250
Brian! Coaster, please.

21:00.680 --> 21:03.380
Now, the qualifying heats
are in two weeks' time.

21:03.460 --> 21:04.500
It's untelevised, of course,

21:04.640 --> 21:09.410
but we'll still need to be in good form
if we're to show them what we can do.

21:09.500 --> 21:10.760
- Brian.
- Shall I come along to that?

21:10.890 --> 21:12.850
- That won't be necessary.
- He is first reserve.

21:12.970 --> 21:15.970
- And I'd be more than happy.
- Team members only, Brian.

21:17.010 --> 21:18.890
I'm sure we can manage without you.

21:21.410 --> 21:22.840
I'm so sorry.

21:22.970 --> 21:24.920
Now, quantum mechanics, anyone?

21:26.700 --> 21:31.180
<i>Dear Spencer, just a quick note to
let you know how things are going here.</i>

21:31.320 --> 21:35.260
<i>My housemates are really interesting.</i>

21:35.350 --> 21:37.530
<i>It's great to meet people
from different backgrounds,</i>

21:37.660 --> 21:39.830
<i>and we are all having
a really good laugh.</i>

21:43.690 --> 21:45.350
I'm so sorry.

21:45.470 --> 21:48.250
<i>I've also become increasingly
politically active,</i>

21:48.390 --> 21:52.340
<i>and have so far protested against
apartheid, nuclear weapons, nuclear power,</i>

21:52.430 --> 21:55.680
<i>gay bashing and sexual
exploitation of women.</i>

21:55.860 --> 21:59.940
...rather than mere objects for
the sexual entertainment of men.

22:00.560 --> 22:03.290
<i>Did you know that,
under the bastard Tories,</i>

22:03.380 --> 22:08.070
<i>seven percent of the country
currently own 84% of the wealth?</i>

22:08.890 --> 22:11.410
<i>It's the same old story.
The rich get richer,</i>

22:11.500 --> 22:14.030
<i>and the most vulnerable
in our country suffer.</i>

22:14.930 --> 22:17.630
<i>Anyway, how are you?
How's the job hunt going?</i>

22:17.750 --> 22:21.280
<i>Got anything more permanent,
or are you still signing on?</i>

22:21.410 --> 22:24.920
<i>I know there's not much out there at
the moment, thanks to bloody Thatcher.</i>

22:24.920 --> 22:27.220
<i>But I'm sure something
will come up soon.</i>

22:27.320 --> 22:29.620
Hey! Piss off out of here.

22:29.740 --> 22:31.700
<i>Must sign off now,
as I've got a lecture.</i>

22:31.840 --> 22:34.090
<i>I'm currently wrestling
with the Romantic poets.</i>

22:34.220 --> 22:37.530
<i>Not literally, of course, as they
have been dead for some time now.</i>

22:39.090 --> 22:43.270
What do the so-called Romantic
Poets mean by the term "Romance"?

22:43.470 --> 22:45.470
It's certainly not hearts and flowers,

22:45.570 --> 22:48.470
though an appreciation of extreme beauty

22:48.690 --> 22:50.340
was a vital source of inspiration.

22:51.690 --> 22:57.120
But the notion of the Romantic poets
as swooning lovelorn fops is a fallacy.

22:57.860 --> 23:02.240
Byron, Wordsworth, Shelley in
particular, were all passionately...

23:02.240 --> 23:03.590
Come on!

23:06.200 --> 23:08.890
- Shouldn't you be at the qualifiers?
- That's the thing.

23:08.980 --> 23:10.770
Colin's been knocked over by a bus.

23:10.890 --> 23:13.370
He's okay, but it means
you're on the team.

23:13.490 --> 23:14.710
Yes!

23:16.930 --> 23:18.890
So glad that he's okay.

23:21.100 --> 23:24.400
Fifty questions, 30 minutes.
Conferring is allowed.

23:25.660 --> 23:30.140
And to make the grade, we need
a score of 70 percent or higher.

23:30.660 --> 23:34.390
Excuse me, but we're trying to do a
quiz here and it's against the clock.

23:34.530 --> 23:36.610
It's got to be done sometime.

23:36.610 --> 23:40.130
<i>This man has been sent from the
offices of University Challenge!</i>

23:46.820 --> 23:49.520
So, if we're ready.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.780
Sergeant Troy, Fanny Robin
and Bathsheba Everdene

23:53.900 --> 23:56.200
all appear in which
novel by Thomas Hardy?

23:56.300 --> 23:57.860
<i>- Return Of The Native.
- Return Of The Native.</i>

23:57.940 --> 24:00.160
<i>Actually I think it might be
Far From The Madding Crowd.</i>

24:00.160 --> 24:02.850
<i>- Oh, of course it is. Go with Brian.
- Far From The Madding Crowd.</i>

24:02.940 --> 24:03.980
Correct!

24:04.110 --> 24:07.850
Passer Domesticus is the scientific
name for which commonly known bird?

24:07.850 --> 24:09.630
- The common house sparrow.
- Correct.

24:09.710 --> 24:11.410
- Inflammation of the pancreas.
- Correct.

24:11.410 --> 24:13.370
- The Sistine Chapel.
- Is the correct answer.

24:13.500 --> 24:14.630
- The rings of Saturn.
- Correct.

24:14.710 --> 24:16.110
- The 38th parallel.
- Correct.

24:16.190 --> 24:18.060
- They carry their young in pouches.
- Correct.

24:18.150 --> 24:19.320
"My love is like a red, red rose."

24:19.410 --> 24:20.580
1664!

24:20.670 --> 24:22.540
- Prime numbers. Diaghilev. The spleen.
- Correct.

24:22.660 --> 24:24.920
The Berlin Airlift. Trick question.

24:25.060 --> 24:27.440
Gamma rays. Longshore
drift. The Venus de Milo.

24:27.440 --> 24:28.580
Correct.

24:28.700 --> 24:30.790
And your final question.

24:30.880 --> 24:33.790
Which decade saw the invention
of the replaceable razor,

24:33.920 --> 24:36.090
the formation of the Ford Motor Company,

24:36.180 --> 24:37.960
and the death of Oscar Wilde?

24:38.050 --> 24:39.310
- The 1890s.
- 1900s

24:39.310 --> 24:42.210
- 1890s.
- I'm pretty sure it's the 1900s.

24:43.470 --> 24:45.470
I am going to have to hurry you.

24:45.560 --> 24:47.130
Lucy, what do you think?

24:47.950 --> 24:50.170
Actually, I think Brian's right.

24:53.680 --> 24:56.380
Is the answer the 1900s?

24:56.820 --> 24:57.860
Correct.

25:00.680 --> 25:03.590
Right. Well, then.
Congratulations, team.

25:03.900 --> 25:07.460
Brian, glad to have you on board.

25:10.450 --> 25:12.550
- You were great.
- Thanks.

25:12.630 --> 25:14.020
Bye.

25:14.110 --> 25:16.100
Brian.

25:17.670 --> 25:19.710
I've never seen anything like it.

25:21.280 --> 25:23.580
You're a general knowledge God.

25:24.020 --> 25:26.490
<i>So what made you wanna
take the Challenge anyway?</i>

25:26.620 --> 25:28.050
<i>The Challenge!</i>

25:28.180 --> 25:32.230
Well, I want to be an actress,
or a TV presenter, or something.

25:32.440 --> 25:35.130
- It's all experience, isn't it?
- Yeah.

25:35.440 --> 25:38.170
How about you? How come
you know all that stuff?

25:38.270 --> 25:39.530
Misspent youth?

25:40.130 --> 25:44.610
And I suppose I've always just
liked that feeling of knowing things.

25:44.740 --> 25:46.520
For some reason it all
goes in and stays there.

25:46.600 --> 25:48.780
And it's just useless knowledge.

25:48.910 --> 25:51.600
You think there's such a
thing as useless knowledge?

25:51.740 --> 25:55.040
Well, sometimes. I wish I
hadn't learned to crochet.

25:55.160 --> 25:57.860
You are joking, aren't you?

25:59.940 --> 26:01.510
Oi, watch it.

26:03.810 --> 26:05.150
Hey!

26:06.070 --> 26:09.190
Better not. There might
be dog poo in there.

26:10.370 --> 26:11.930
Right.

26:12.020 --> 26:14.540
Oh, God, I just
remembered! Mask workshop.

26:14.630 --> 26:17.840
I've gotta run. See you
at the next rehearsal.

26:19.840 --> 26:22.660
Alice, what are you doing on Friday?

26:24.320 --> 26:25.800
It's just, it's my birthday.

26:25.800 --> 26:27.840
You're having a party.
Well, of course I'll come.

26:27.970 --> 26:31.700
Not a party, exactly. I was,
I was thinking more dinner.

26:32.660 --> 26:34.230
Or something...

26:35.270 --> 26:37.530
Just me and you?

26:38.480 --> 26:39.830
Mmm-hmm.

26:42.220 --> 26:44.220
Brian, I'd love to.

26:44.950 --> 26:46.380
Is the correct answer.

26:49.420 --> 26:51.730
Okay. Friday.

27:32.750 --> 27:34.430
Something wrong?

27:34.530 --> 27:38.570
No. No, I just think you could've
put in a bit more effort, that's all.

27:42.040 --> 27:44.000
So, where are you taking me?

27:54.640 --> 27:57.030
It's a good job I reserved a table.

27:57.030 --> 27:59.120
- This is great.
- Are you sure?

27:59.210 --> 28:02.110
It looked posher from outside,
with all the candles and everything.

28:02.250 --> 28:05.550
But I love pizza. And
they do one with chips on.

28:07.110 --> 28:08.810
"King Edward."

28:11.500 --> 28:15.980
Hello. Hi. Excuse me.

28:21.100 --> 28:24.620
The Lambrusco Bianco,

28:25.970 --> 28:27.660
could you tell me what year it is?

28:27.660 --> 28:28.920
1985.

28:30.570 --> 28:34.830
No, I know. I know what year it
is. I meant what year is the wine?

28:34.960 --> 28:36.090
1985.

28:37.430 --> 28:38.780
Very well.

28:39.520 --> 28:42.870
We'll have the white
Lambrusco Bianco '85, please.

28:47.860 --> 28:50.860
Look! Breadsticks. Hooray!

29:09.200 --> 29:12.620
You know, I think I'm going
to have these garlic mushrooms.

29:12.760 --> 29:15.580
Well, you won't be
snogging anyone tonight.

29:21.100 --> 29:23.880
So, have you had many boyfriends, or...

29:25.050 --> 29:27.750
- Where did that come from?
- I don't know. I'm just curious.

29:27.880 --> 29:30.570
What, you really want to know? Okay.

29:32.350 --> 29:35.270
When I was 15, there was Charlie,

29:35.350 --> 29:38.390
who was the lead singer in this band.

29:39.300 --> 29:41.600
He was incredibly handsome.

29:42.440 --> 29:43.600
Gorgeous.

29:43.700 --> 29:47.040
I left him for Rufus. We
then had a nine-month affair.

29:47.120 --> 29:49.120
I then went out with his best friend.

29:49.210 --> 29:52.430
And then I had a fling with a
lovely Italian guy called Alessandro.

29:53.470 --> 29:55.380
He was, like, skinny
because he was younger,

29:55.470 --> 29:57.640
but he had, like,
muscles and definition.

29:57.770 --> 30:02.030
Gregor was lovely, but
incredibly possessive.

30:03.070 --> 30:07.240
In the end we had to call the
police and I think he was deported.

30:08.280 --> 30:10.980
And I think that that's about it.

30:12.840 --> 30:17.450
Funny, isn't it, how many of them
end up being mad, or suicidal?

30:18.710 --> 30:20.580
- Or in prison.
- I know.

30:20.660 --> 30:24.310
Rufus, you know the performance
artist, the one who set fire to himself?

30:25.570 --> 30:28.400
He used to say I had the kiss of death.

30:30.050 --> 30:33.050
That's why I'm giving it all
up. Concentrate on my work.

30:34.090 --> 30:36.390
Get me to a nunnery.

30:37.050 --> 30:40.260
- Hamlet, Act 3, Scene 1.
- You never stop, do you?

30:40.780 --> 30:43.080
What do your parents do again?

30:44.740 --> 30:47.560
Mum works in a shoe shop and Dad's dead.

30:49.430 --> 30:52.950
It's all right. You don't need to get
all serious. It was a long time ago.

30:53.080 --> 30:54.640
What happened?

30:54.730 --> 30:57.250
Well, he was a salesman. Double glazing.

30:57.330 --> 31:01.420
You know, working on commission.
Long, long hours. He hated it.

31:02.250 --> 31:06.720
Anyway, it must've been eating away at him
because one day he just fell over, apparently.

31:07.240 --> 31:11.200
In this old couple's living room,
selling polyurethane windows.

31:11.630 --> 31:14.620
Forty-one years old. Let's, uh...

31:16.620 --> 31:19.230
Let's get another drink. Excuse me.

31:19.320 --> 31:22.670
- Do you think about him?
- Yeah, of course. Every day.

31:23.580 --> 31:27.870
But we never really got to know
one another. Not as adults, anyway.

31:28.930 --> 31:31.830
I really only remember sitting
in front of the telly with him.

31:31.920 --> 31:33.790
Quizzes. He loved quizzes.

31:33.920 --> 31:36.390
Nature programmes, anything educational.

31:36.520 --> 31:37.870
Knowledge.

31:37.960 --> 31:40.860
That was the key, he
said, to being happy.

31:41.300 --> 31:44.120
Not ending up doing some job you hate.

31:47.860 --> 31:49.120
Where's that waiter?

31:49.210 --> 31:52.030
- He'd have loved you.
- You think so?

31:52.860 --> 31:55.690
Of course. Don't you?

31:56.590 --> 31:58.160
Don't know.

31:59.330 --> 32:02.330
I think he might've thought I
was a bit weird, to be honest.

32:02.460 --> 32:05.240
- Oh, he'd have been very proud of you.
- Why?

32:05.980 --> 32:09.840
Going to university.
Star of the quiz team.

32:11.420 --> 32:16.620
- Doing all the things he never got to do.
- Yeah, maybe. Maybe.

32:18.280 --> 32:19.750
Anyway, Alice, excuse me,

32:19.840 --> 32:22.750
do you mind if I just
pop off to the loo?

32:25.570 --> 32:29.090
You are such a lovely man.

32:40.040 --> 32:42.040
I'm sorry about tonight.

32:42.860 --> 32:45.560
I don't usually cry until
much later in the evening.

32:45.560 --> 32:47.560
You mustn't apologise.

32:48.080 --> 32:51.070
It was very illuminating.

32:53.470 --> 32:55.550
Brian, what are you doing at Christmas?

32:55.690 --> 32:59.940
Just the usual. Watching telly
with Mum, eating cheap chocolate.

33:01.070 --> 33:02.980
That kind of thing, really. Why?

33:03.070 --> 33:05.760
Well, it's just that we've
got this cottage in Suffolk.

33:05.760 --> 33:08.580
And it's so dull when it's
just Michael and Rose and me.

33:08.680 --> 33:10.980
- Who are Michael and Rose?
- My parents.

33:11.800 --> 33:14.540
I thought, maybe you
could come and stay.

33:18.710 --> 33:23.050
- I can't really leave Mum.
- No, but after Christmas. For New Year.

33:23.050 --> 33:25.570
My parents keep themselves to
themselves most of the time,

33:25.670 --> 33:30.270
so it'd just be me and you,
walking, reading, hanging out.

33:30.350 --> 33:34.440
- But if the idea fills you with dread...
- Yes!

33:35.480 --> 33:40.180
No... Yes... That would be really good.

33:41.080 --> 33:42.650
It's decided, then.

33:44.430 --> 33:45.780
Thank you.

33:50.550 --> 33:51.730
Good night.

34:10.159 --> 34:12.760
So I take it it went okay then, Romeo?

34:13.719 --> 34:16.800
Well, you know, it went all right.

34:17.670 --> 34:19.840
So is love in the air?

34:19.929 --> 34:21.620
Not love.

34:22.969 --> 34:26.190
- Like.
- Like is in the air.

34:49.730 --> 34:51.810
Mum, I'm home.

34:53.989 --> 34:55.159
Mum?

35:08.890 --> 35:12.670
Brian! Get out! Get out now!

35:14.840 --> 35:20.150
<i>Our obligation to make our own
individual contributions, however small...</i>

35:28.050 --> 35:30.880
<i>His name's Des, a widower
from down the road.</i>

35:31.000 --> 35:32.880
<i>An ice cream man.</i>

35:33.260 --> 35:36.520
<i>You know when he's coming round
because you can hear the chimes.</i>

35:36.600 --> 35:39.960
<i>They've been keeping each
other company ever since I left.</i>

35:40.040 --> 35:42.040
<i>Twice a day, sometimes.</i>

35:42.430 --> 35:43.990
These are nice, Julie.

35:44.130 --> 35:46.820
Little sausages wrapped in bacon, Des.

35:48.170 --> 35:49.950
Eat your sprouts, you'll get rickets.

35:50.030 --> 35:53.380
Rickets is calcium deficiency,
Mum. You're thinking of scurvy.

35:53.470 --> 35:56.590
Brian, I don't care.
Just eat them, will you?

35:58.680 --> 36:03.590
<i>And I hope that we shall all try to
make some good news in the coming year.</i>

36:04.420 --> 36:07.540
By the way, I've got
an announcement to make.

36:08.370 --> 36:10.150
What's that, then?

36:10.240 --> 36:12.840
It's just something
that happened last term.

36:12.840 --> 36:16.490
- Oh, God, Brian.
- Mum, don't worry, it's a good thing.

36:16.630 --> 36:18.270
Tel me, then.

36:19.930 --> 36:22.150
<i>I'm gonna be on University Challenge.</i>

36:24.450 --> 36:26.310
What, that thing on the telly?

36:27.230 --> 36:28.480
Yeah.

36:29.310 --> 36:32.220
Congratulations, Brian.
That's brilliant news.

36:32.360 --> 36:34.740
- Oh, God, what a relief.
- Why?

36:35.780 --> 36:39.430
Well, to be honest, Brian, I thought
you were gonna say you were gay.

37:02.540 --> 37:06.630
- What're you doing, Mum?
- Oh, just telling him what you're up to.

37:06.630 --> 37:09.410
How you're going to be
on telly and everything.

37:10.890 --> 37:12.540
What does Dad say?

37:15.670 --> 37:18.050
He doesn't say anything, Brian.

37:23.710 --> 37:25.490
How long you down for, then?

37:25.570 --> 37:28.050
Actually, I'm leaving
the day after tomorrow.

37:28.700 --> 37:30.360
You're not coming out New Year?

37:30.360 --> 37:33.620
No, I'm gonna go stay with
my mate Alice, in her cottage.

37:33.700 --> 37:36.390
Cottage? What is she, a milkmaid?

37:36.520 --> 37:38.080
Are you shagging her, then?

37:38.170 --> 37:40.780
- Tone, it's platonic.
- What does that mean?

37:40.870 --> 37:42.870
Means she won't let him shag her.

37:46.510 --> 37:48.690
- Get lost, Tone.
- What?

38:05.680 --> 38:10.280
- All right, where now? Ritzy's? Manhattan's?
- Not Manhattan's.

38:10.370 --> 38:13.890
- Actually, I think I'm gonna go home.
- Come on, Jackson, you wuss.

38:14.010 --> 38:15.970
No, no, I'm all right.
I've got reading and stuff.

38:16.110 --> 38:18.710
- But I'll see you soon, yeah?
- Yeah, yeah, piss off.

38:24.530 --> 38:26.700
What's up with you?

38:27.050 --> 38:30.040
Why are we always telling
each other to piss off, Spence?

38:30.140 --> 38:34.140
What's wrong with "Good night",
"Sleep well", "Happy Christmas"?

38:34.300 --> 38:37.350
I just don't get all this hostility.

38:38.690 --> 38:41.820
Listen, Bri. You're my oldest mate.

38:41.820 --> 38:43.470
You're my best mate and I love you.

38:43.610 --> 38:46.730
And I think it's great you're going
out there, meeting all these new people,

38:46.810 --> 38:48.390
staying in cottages.

38:48.470 --> 38:50.550
All that stuff.

38:50.990 --> 38:55.900
Promise me one thing, yeah? Promise
me you haven't turned into a wanker.

39:09.240 --> 39:11.800
Oi, Spence. Spence, wait for me.

39:18.790 --> 39:21.620
- Now, take a towel.
- I'll use their towels.

39:21.710 --> 39:24.100
- You can't use their towels.
- Bye, Mum.

39:24.440 --> 39:27.050
- All right, at least take this.
- What is it?

39:27.140 --> 39:30.880
Cold meat. You know, turkey, ham.
Couple of those little sausages.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.090
Mum, I really don't think
that they're gonna need that.

39:33.180 --> 39:35.560
Oh, take it. It'll only go off. Please.

39:37.040 --> 39:38.690
Just stick it in.

39:40.260 --> 39:42.040
You sure you don't want
to stay for New Year?

39:42.130 --> 39:45.170
No, not this year, Mum. Besides,
you've got Mr Whippy now, haven't you?

39:45.250 --> 39:46.910
Brian. That's enough.

39:47.030 --> 39:50.990
- What?
- You know what. Go on, then.

39:53.820 --> 39:55.160
Have fun.

40:17.670 --> 40:19.750
Happy Christmas, Brian.

40:22.660 --> 40:24.620
It's so good to see you.

40:26.000 --> 40:30.480
It's an actual fact that bees hum by
blowing air through their spiracles.

40:30.570 --> 40:33.780
- Spiracles. It's fascinating.
- I know.

40:34.220 --> 40:36.910
Isn't that fascinating, Michael?

40:37.040 --> 40:38.690
Sorry, I was somewhere else.

40:39.430 --> 40:41.910
So, Brian, is this your
first time in Suffolk?

40:42.030 --> 40:45.250
No, I was here once before
on a climbing holiday.

40:45.390 --> 40:46.600
Really?

40:47.250 --> 40:48.990
Isn't it very flat for climbing?

40:49.950 --> 40:52.030
I was misinformed.

40:55.600 --> 40:58.160
- Brian's joking, Rose.
- Oh.

41:11.330 --> 41:14.530
Oh, my God, I love this song.

41:15.150 --> 41:18.920
I lost my virginity to this
on a mime course in Tuscany.

41:19.010 --> 41:22.530
- Yeah?
- Let's set the mood.

41:26.180 --> 41:28.400
Michael and Rose have gone to bed.

41:41.610 --> 41:43.090
No, thanks.

41:43.990 --> 41:47.030
- What's up?
- I just can't smoke.

41:48.170 --> 41:51.200
- You can't smoke?
- No, I've never learned.

41:51.820 --> 41:54.340
Oh, my God, Brian,
how can you not smoke?

41:54.940 --> 41:57.120
Smoking's what I do best.

41:57.460 --> 41:59.550
Or second best, anyway.

42:00.680 --> 42:04.240
All right, we'll try
a different approach.

42:04.330 --> 42:07.750
On your knees, facing me,
hands behind your back.

42:10.450 --> 42:13.410
Now, I'm gonna blow the
smoke into your mouth,

42:13.490 --> 42:16.930
and you're going to inhale,
very deeply. Understood?

42:38.690 --> 42:41.090
- Nice?
- Very nice.

42:41.390 --> 42:43.600
- Again?
- Please.

42:43.690 --> 42:45.250
Are you sure? It's very strong.

42:45.390 --> 42:47.770
- I can take it.
- Okay, here goes.

43:07.230 --> 43:10.590
You really should exhale now.

43:12.970 --> 43:17.880
This is a terrible idea.
Kiss of death. Remember?

43:29.960 --> 43:33.170
Actually I... I feel a little bit...

43:37.050 --> 43:39.870
Oh, for Christ's sake.
Good night, Brian.

43:49.040 --> 43:50.240
Oh, shit.

43:56.940 --> 43:58.680
Here it is.

44:27.050 --> 44:28.480
Oh, my God!

44:31.530 --> 44:33.790
Well, hello, Mrs Harbinson.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.610
Brian. You scared me.

44:39.730 --> 44:43.600
Still, I expect you've seen
hundreds of naked women before.

44:44.120 --> 44:46.520
You'd be surprised, Mrs Harbinson.

44:46.600 --> 44:48.680
I've told you before,
please don't call me that.

44:48.820 --> 44:51.500
It makes me feel so old. Call me Rose.

44:54.860 --> 44:57.850
Are you trying to
seduce me, Mrs Harbinson?

44:59.720 --> 45:00.980
What?

45:01.200 --> 45:05.070
I said, are you trying to
seduce me, Mrs Harbinson?

45:05.450 --> 45:07.750
No, Brian, I most certainly am not.

45:07.850 --> 45:11.840
No, I know. It's just a quote.

45:12.020 --> 45:13.490
You know, like Mrs Robinson...

45:13.580 --> 45:16.100
I haven't the least intention
of trying to seduce you.

45:16.190 --> 45:18.920
I know. And I don't want
to seduce you either.

45:19.020 --> 45:21.620
That's not to say you're
unattractive, because, obviously,

45:21.700 --> 45:24.530
you've got a beautiful body
for someone of your age.

45:24.530 --> 45:26.010
I beg your pardon!

45:26.010 --> 45:27.660
What's going on down here?

45:27.740 --> 45:29.130
Nothing's going on.

45:29.220 --> 45:30.570
Hello, Mr Harbinson.

45:30.700 --> 45:32.350
What the hell are you talking about?

45:32.430 --> 45:36.090
Nothing. I just came down for a
glass of milk and I bumped into Brian.

45:36.210 --> 45:38.610
Right. I think I'll
just head back upstairs.

45:38.690 --> 45:41.210
Brian, where are your trousers?

45:41.300 --> 45:43.300
Well, you can talk, big guy.

45:44.950 --> 45:47.560
Brian, are you... Are you stoned?

45:49.940 --> 45:51.820
No way, man.

46:03.370 --> 46:06.410
I'm so sorry about all this.
We only found out this morning.

46:06.490 --> 46:09.540
Granny fell down the stairs in the
night, and fractured her hip apparently.

46:09.630 --> 46:12.450
We just thought we better go and
see her in hospital down in Dorset.

46:12.540 --> 46:15.880
Mum and Dad set off early this morning.
They send their love, by the way.

46:16.020 --> 46:19.010
They're so sorry you can't
be here for New Year's Eve.

46:19.100 --> 46:22.440
Actually, I bumped into them
in the kitchen last night.

46:22.580 --> 46:25.480
- Really?
- Did they say anything?

46:25.570 --> 46:28.700
- No. Not at all.
- Great.

46:29.530 --> 46:33.610
Listen, Brian, the train's
not for six, seven minutes yet.

46:33.690 --> 46:36.090
Do you mind if I don't hang around?

46:38.170 --> 46:39.730
Of course not.

46:49.640 --> 46:53.900
Hello. Anyone home?

46:59.930 --> 47:02.030
No. Thought not.

47:15.140 --> 47:18.180
Excuse me, come to our demonstration.

47:19.540 --> 47:22.140
- Come to our demonstration?
- Sorry, no thank you.

47:25.870 --> 47:27.870
Protesting on New Year's Eve?

47:27.960 --> 47:29.950
Injustice never rests.

47:29.960 --> 47:33.090
Well, methinks the lady
doth protest too much.

47:37.130 --> 47:39.520
It's from Hamlet. It's a joke.

47:39.650 --> 47:41.950
I think I'll be the judge of that.

47:42.040 --> 47:44.340
- Good Christmas?
- Not really. You?

47:44.420 --> 47:48.600
We're secular Jewish non-Zionist
socialists. We don't really do Christmas.

47:48.680 --> 47:50.600
Right. Sounds a riot.

47:50.600 --> 47:52.850
Why do you think I'm back here?

47:52.990 --> 47:54.200
What's in the bag?

47:54.330 --> 47:55.990
It's New Year's Eve dinner.

47:58.730 --> 48:01.710
Individual chicken pie
and a tin of sweetcorn.

48:01.810 --> 48:03.810
Fasten your seatbelts.

48:04.410 --> 48:06.500
Yeah, except for a souvenir tea towel.

48:06.630 --> 48:08.710
Well, I hope you had some clothes on.

48:08.800 --> 48:10.980
Socks, shoes, no trousers.

48:12.020 --> 48:13.280
What, and then she chucked you out?

48:13.400 --> 48:15.140
- She didn't chuck me out, Rebecca.
- No?

48:15.280 --> 48:16.700
No. Alice's elderly grandmother

48:16.840 --> 48:19.750
accidentally had a fall down
the stairs and fractured her hip.

48:23.490 --> 48:26.530
- She could've been telling the truth.
- Yeah, of course she was telling the truth.

48:29.750 --> 48:31.390
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

48:31.530 --> 48:32.790
Sorry.

48:34.430 --> 48:36.820
So, what are we gonna do tonight?

48:37.870 --> 48:41.080
- Haven't you got a party to go to?
- I think I can skip that.

48:44.520 --> 48:46.600
I've got an individual chicken pie.

48:47.250 --> 48:49.940
Oh. Well, then, how
could I possibly refuse?

48:50.080 --> 48:52.160
I'm only flesh and blood.

49:00.150 --> 49:02.670
I've never been very good
at those parties, anyway.

49:02.760 --> 49:07.240
Two hundred drunk students hurling
themselves at each other in a tiny room.

49:08.720 --> 49:12.880
Then at 3:00 in the morning,
some lager-breathed stranger

49:12.980 --> 49:15.140
trying to rub his face on me.

49:15.280 --> 49:17.360
I think I'm safer here.

49:18.490 --> 49:22.660
So you don't have
a... What's the word...

49:24.130 --> 49:26.010
Boyfriend, or partner?

49:26.090 --> 49:27.430
What, comrade?

49:28.270 --> 49:30.350
Not as such.

49:30.350 --> 49:33.480
Never seemed to have much
luck in that department.

49:33.610 --> 49:35.910
I don't know why.

49:36.740 --> 49:38.820
I don't know why, either.

49:40.690 --> 49:43.080
- Brian, are you trying to flirt?
- No.

49:43.080 --> 49:45.770
Then why are you putting on that voice?

49:45.780 --> 49:47.560
Look, I just mean...

49:48.160 --> 49:52.680
I'm sure you could have a, you
know, boyfriend if you wanted one.

49:52.770 --> 49:56.730
I have my amorous moments, I suppose.

49:57.330 --> 49:58.890
Once in a while.

50:03.070 --> 50:04.760
What's this?

50:04.850 --> 50:07.240
It's my notebook. It's...

50:08.500 --> 50:11.180
That's just for jotting down ideas,

50:11.920 --> 50:13.580
bits of poetry.

50:14.230 --> 50:18.710
Brian, you have to promise me something.

50:18.790 --> 50:22.870
Promise me that you will never,
never show me your poetry.

50:23.270 --> 50:25.790
I wouldn't dare, Rebecca.

50:30.170 --> 50:35.260
- Hey, what's the time?
- It's... 11:56.

50:36.600 --> 50:39.640
We can't start 1986
listening to this moaning.

50:39.740 --> 50:42.040
- We?
- Right.

50:56.510 --> 51:00.590
- Well, I hope you're not too disappointed.
- What?

51:00.670 --> 51:03.890
Stuck here with me instead of blondie.

51:04.850 --> 51:08.720
Rebecca! Of course not. I... Look.

51:10.140 --> 51:12.240
I'd much rather be here.

51:12.450 --> 51:13.920
Is that right?

51:19.310 --> 51:22.450
- Hey, what's the time?
- It's 11:58.

51:22.970 --> 51:25.700
Two minutes to go.

51:25.790 --> 51:28.910
So, what shall we do to pass the time?

52:03.500 --> 52:05.360
Wait. Hang on a sec, Brian.

52:05.460 --> 52:08.200
What? I'm sorry, was that wrong?

52:08.280 --> 52:10.580
Wrong? No, it's not that. Look.

52:41.000 --> 52:42.860
Happy New Year, Brian.

52:43.080 --> 52:44.730
Happy New Year, Alice.

52:48.690 --> 52:49.950
Alice?

52:56.810 --> 52:57.850
Rebecca.

52:57.980 --> 53:01.630
Rebecca! Look, it was
a slip of the tongue.

53:01.720 --> 53:03.580
What, the tongue you had
down my throat, you mean?

53:03.720 --> 53:05.460
You really are a complete
and utter prat, Jackson!

53:05.580 --> 53:08.060
- I know.
- Christ knows I've met some prats in my time,

53:08.200 --> 53:09.760
but you really do win the award.

53:09.840 --> 53:11.540
Let me help you with that.

53:11.620 --> 53:13.400
Get your hands off of me!

53:14.450 --> 53:16.930
Well, thanks for a
memorable evening, Brian.

53:17.050 --> 53:19.310
And have a Happy New Year.

53:35.780 --> 53:38.080
Happy New Year!

53:49.430 --> 53:50.990
- Hello, Brian.
- Hi.

54:26.310 --> 54:32.040
"My heart aches, and a drowsy
numbness pains my sense,

54:33.080 --> 54:35.480
"as though of hemlock I had drunk,

54:35.560 --> 54:39.560
"or emptied some dull
opiate to the drains."

54:40.910 --> 54:42.040
Brian.

54:43.380 --> 54:45.250
Stay on afterwards, will you?

54:46.210 --> 54:49.550
"One minute past and
leafy woods had sunk."

54:50.590 --> 54:53.070
Are you experiencing emotional problems?

54:53.200 --> 54:54.770
Emotional problems?

54:55.680 --> 54:59.850
Affairs of the heart, anxieties of
a romantic, or perhaps sexual nature.

54:59.940 --> 55:03.720
And believe me, Brian, I'm finding this
at least as embarrassing as you are.

55:05.060 --> 55:07.020
What makes you ask?

55:07.140 --> 55:10.280
When I interviewed you, a
year ago now, you struck me as

55:10.360 --> 55:12.360
being a particularly
passionate young man.

55:12.450 --> 55:15.360
A little incoherent, maybe a little
gauche. Is that fair, do you think?

55:15.490 --> 55:16.610
Go on.

55:16.620 --> 55:19.830
But you also seemed to have a
sincere passion for knowledge

55:19.970 --> 55:22.130
that's missing from some
our, what shall we say,

55:22.270 --> 55:24.960
some of our more privileged students.

55:24.960 --> 55:26.920
And that's why I was
happy to offer you a place

55:27.050 --> 55:29.740
because I knew that you'd
actually fought for it.

55:31.000 --> 55:32.860
But looking at your grades this year,

55:32.960 --> 55:37.470
7 4%, 68%, 57%.

55:39.340 --> 55:42.470
It seems you're actually
becoming less intelligent.

55:42.470 --> 55:47.170
And that, strangely enough, is
not what an education is for.

55:48.290 --> 55:50.160
- Jackson, Bristol!
- Toad and Badger.

55:50.250 --> 55:52.250
Is the wrong answer.

55:52.250 --> 55:54.420
The T-S in T.S. Elliot stands for.

55:54.550 --> 55:56.330
- Jackson, Bristol!
- Thomas Stewart.

55:56.420 --> 55:58.800
- Once again, the wrong answer. Lucy?
- Thomas Stearns.

55:58.900 --> 56:00.060
- Correct.
- Patrick, I just want...

56:00.160 --> 56:01.720
The studio conditions, Brian.

56:02.680 --> 56:06.020
In anatomy, where might you find the
arcuate fasciculus, Wernicke's area...

56:08.060 --> 56:09.100
Jackson, Bristol.

56:09.230 --> 56:10.800
Sorry. Is Alice coming today?

56:10.890 --> 56:13.710
Apparently not. I'm not
delighted about it, either, Brian.

56:13.790 --> 56:15.890
In 24 hours we're making a
recorded appearance in front of

56:16.010 --> 56:20.790
a TV audience of millions and you think
Thomas Elliot's middle name was Stewart!

56:20.790 --> 56:22.660
Once again.

56:22.660 --> 56:24.830
The arcuate fasciculus,
Wernicke's area...

56:34.120 --> 56:36.300
So this is where it all happens, is it?

56:36.820 --> 56:39.040
Spencer? What are you doing here?

56:39.120 --> 56:42.120
I thought I'd pay you a
visit. You don't mind, do you?

56:42.650 --> 56:44.120
No.

56:47.850 --> 56:51.110
Really good to see you, Spence,
just a bit of a surprise, that's all.

56:51.200 --> 56:52.330
Who let you in, anyway?

56:52.460 --> 56:55.070
Some wanker in a velvet waistcoat.

56:56.330 --> 56:58.200
You were nice to him,
though, weren't you?

56:58.280 --> 56:59.840
I don't know. Should I have been?

57:01.200 --> 57:03.580
It's just, I do have to live
with him, and I just asked?

57:03.720 --> 57:05.800
Yeah? Are you writing poetry?

57:05.890 --> 57:09.540
No. Give me that! Give me that!

57:12.050 --> 57:13.930
- Give me that.
- Who's Alice anyway?

57:14.750 --> 57:16.090
With the big bosoms?

57:16.230 --> 57:17.570
You're not serious?

57:18.610 --> 57:21.310
You are serious. Bloody
hell, Spencer. What now?

57:21.400 --> 57:23.700
I'm being prosecuted for
fiddling me unemployment benefit.

57:23.830 --> 57:24.960
What's gonna happen?

57:24.960 --> 57:27.350
I don't know. Depends
on the judge, I suppose.

57:28.300 --> 57:31.600
But you still got the arcade job, right?

57:31.740 --> 57:35.170
Not as such, no. They sort of
found me with my hand in the till.

57:35.260 --> 57:36.730
What do they think you took?

57:36.820 --> 57:39.040
- Couple of hundred.
- How much did you take?

57:39.130 --> 57:40.990
Yeah, couple of hundred
sounds about right.

57:41.130 --> 57:42.330
Spencer.

57:42.470 --> 57:45.470
You're a socialist. I thought you
approved of the redistribution of wealth.

57:45.590 --> 57:49.420
By acquiring the means of
production. Not by just nicking stuff.

57:49.550 --> 57:51.940
Can we talk about something else?

57:52.030 --> 57:54.850
I came here to get away from all that.
Have a bit of a laugh, bit of fun, yeah.

57:54.940 --> 57:57.980
Okay. Yeah, we can do that.

58:00.370 --> 58:03.060
- Is she gonna be there?
- Who?

58:03.280 --> 58:07.670
You know, the posh one.
The one in the poems.

58:07.670 --> 58:11.010
Alice? I hope so. Be
nice, though, won't you?

58:11.100 --> 58:14.230
Who, me? I'm always nice.

58:14.310 --> 58:17.050
This hand and a bucket of water...

58:17.140 --> 58:19.750
Look, let's move on.

58:19.830 --> 58:21.830
# With many cheerful facts
about the square of hypotenuse

58:22.050 --> 58:24.140
# With many cheerful facts
about the square of hypotenuse

58:24.220 --> 58:28.080
# With many cheerful facts
about the square of hypotenuse

58:28.180 --> 58:30.480
# I am the very model
of a modern Major-General

58:30.560 --> 58:33.910
# I've information, vegetable,
animal, and mineral... #

58:34.040 --> 58:35.170
Pub?

58:36.430 --> 58:40.170
lt'll liven up. Come on, let's see
what's happening upstairs, yeah?

58:45.690 --> 58:47.330
Come here.

58:50.160 --> 58:51.720
That's her.

58:53.380 --> 58:55.380
In the leotard.

58:55.380 --> 58:58.060
- Well, introduce us, then.
- What for?

58:58.200 --> 59:00.150
- You told me to be nice.
- Yeah, but

59:00.160 --> 59:01.500
I thought we'd go have
a drink or something...

59:01.630 --> 59:04.020
- She's coming over. She's coming over.
- What?

59:04.110 --> 59:05.370
Hello.

59:09.750 --> 59:11.530
Hi.

59:11.630 --> 59:13.190
So, who's this, then?

59:13.270 --> 59:15.270
Alice, this is Spencer.

59:15.360 --> 59:19.140
Oh, the famous Spencer.
I've heard all about you.

59:19.230 --> 59:20.570
- I've heard all about you.
- Oh, good.

59:20.700 --> 59:23.180
- Drink, anyone?
- Tell me, what have you heard?

59:23.310 --> 59:25.480
I don't think I can say.

59:25.560 --> 59:27.260
- Anyone want a drink?
- What have you heard?

59:27.340 --> 59:28.480
- You first.
- No, you first.

59:28.610 --> 59:30.780
I'm gonna just go and
get some drinks, yeah?

59:31.520 --> 59:36.210
# Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme

59:36.300 --> 59:40.690
# Without no seams nor needlework... #

59:48.200 --> 59:49.640
You're not gonna hit me, are you?

59:52.160 --> 59:54.120
I haven't decided yet.

59:57.240 --> 59:58.720
Rebecca.

59:58.800 --> 01:00:00.500
- I'm sorry about...
- Look, Brian.

01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:02.670
I got drunk. I was having a nice time

01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:06.630
and I fancied a bit of
human, whatever, contact.

01:00:07.060 --> 01:00:12.450
And I made a mistake. Misread the signals.
Very embarrassing, but not a big deal.

01:00:12.570 --> 01:00:14.530
I'm sure I'll learn to love again.

01:00:24.140 --> 01:00:27.260
Have you got your fluffy mascot
packed ready for the big match?

01:00:27.350 --> 01:00:29.220
No, think it's all a bit
silly, that mascot stuff.

01:00:29.350 --> 01:00:32.040
Brian, you're such a maverick!

01:00:32.130 --> 01:00:33.520
So, are you gonna come
along and watch, then?

01:00:33.610 --> 01:00:35.910
What, see you in action?
You must be joking.

01:00:35.990 --> 01:00:37.870
I wish you would.
There's a free minibus.

01:00:37.990 --> 01:00:40.070
Yeah, what do you care anyway?

01:00:40.990 --> 01:00:43.600
Just like you to be there, that's all.

01:00:43.730 --> 01:00:47.460
Only don't say anything to my mate
Spencer. He'd only take a piss.

01:00:47.550 --> 01:00:48.900
Oh, my God, Patrick!

01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:55.280
Brian, I hope that's not an
alcoholic beverage in your hand there.

01:00:55.380 --> 01:00:57.540
- Big day tomorrow and all.
- Why's that, then?

01:00:57.680 --> 01:00:59.760
'Cause he's the team's
star player, aren't you?

01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:02.540
<i>- What team?
- This year's University Challenge team.</i>

01:01:04.750 --> 01:01:06.410
- You're joking?
- No.

01:01:06.410 --> 01:01:07.750
You?

01:01:07.890 --> 01:01:09.840
Me, Alice, Lucy and Patrick.

01:01:09.970 --> 01:01:11.840
- What, actually on telly?
- Yeah.

01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:15.790
- Bloody hell, Brian. You dark horse.
- Something funny?

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:17.660
No, not at all, mate.

01:01:17.790 --> 01:01:20.180
Just always wondered what
kind of bizarre nerdy swot

01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:22.780
would wanna go on a programme like
that, turns out it's you, Brian.

01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:25.480
- I didn't want to tell you.
- So...

01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:28.390
Where are you studying, mate?

01:01:28.910 --> 01:01:31.950
Actually, Patrick, Spencer
is taking a year out.

01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:35.170
- No, I'm not. I'm unemployed.
- I see.

01:01:35.250 --> 01:01:38.290
- Social Security, then.
- That's right, yeah.

01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:41.120
Or he was, until those bastards
decided to prosecute him.

01:01:41.210 --> 01:01:44.550
- Are you being prosecuted, Spencer?
- Only for fiddling his dole.

01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:46.510
Do you think you'll go to prison?

01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:48.500
I'm sure if he didn't
do it, he'll be fine.

01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:52.380
But he did. He had to, didn't
you? Just to make a living wage.

01:01:52.460 --> 01:01:54.850
- So you did have a job? -
Bit of cash-in-hand, yeah.

01:01:54.940 --> 01:01:56.940
Well, then, I have to
say best of luck, mate.

01:01:57.020 --> 01:01:59.630
Well, hang on. Do you have any idea
how much the government pay a week?

01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:01.630
So, there's obviously
plenty of work out there.

01:02:01.710 --> 01:02:03.490
That's a little harsh,
Patrick, some people...

01:02:03.590 --> 01:02:06.410
- There's three million unemployed.
- Yes, but he isn't one of them, is he?

01:02:06.410 --> 01:02:07.590
If his job wasn't paying him enough,

01:02:07.670 --> 01:02:09.010
he should get on his bike
and find a better one.

01:02:09.150 --> 01:02:11.530
He certainly shouldn't steal
from law abiding citizens...

01:02:12.580 --> 01:02:14.960
Here's a question for
you, mate! What is my name?

01:02:15.050 --> 01:02:16.230
- What?
- Spencer put him down.

01:02:16.310 --> 01:02:18.100
You heard me, what is my name?

01:02:18.310 --> 01:02:20.360
- I'll have to hurry you.
- Spencer, I'm serious, put him down.

01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:22.040
- My name is?
- Patrick, say Spencer.

01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:23.920
- Spencer, Spencer.
- Correct.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.480
And if you got something to say to
me, you say it to my face! All right?

01:02:31.300 --> 01:02:32.570
Patrick.

01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:34.870
Spencer!

01:03:09.450 --> 01:03:11.230
The party's over.

01:03:16.530 --> 01:03:18.840
Your friend was looking for you.

01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:23.610
- Why do you think I'm sitting out here?
- Yeah.

01:03:24.140 --> 01:03:26.220
Quite a handful, isn't he?

01:03:30.910 --> 01:03:32.570
Is Alice all right?

01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:42.160
Brian, sometimes the people
you care about the most just

01:03:42.770 --> 01:03:44.860
basically they don't
give a toss about you.

01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:46.940
Look, you don't know that.

01:03:47.030 --> 01:03:48.820
Well, go on, then. Try. I dare you.

01:03:48.900 --> 01:03:51.200
Go and see her right now
and tell her how you feel

01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:54.110
and then maybe we can
all get some bloody peace.

01:04:27.650 --> 01:04:29.570
Come on, Alice, open up.

01:04:34.430 --> 01:04:36.820
Oh, my God, Brian. What's up?

01:04:37.860 --> 01:04:40.160
Could I come in, do you think?

01:04:40.170 --> 01:04:43.080
- I'll get some clothes on.
- All right.

01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:52.900
Okay, you can come in.

01:04:56.200 --> 01:04:58.930
All right, I'm sorry about tonight.

01:05:00.150 --> 01:05:02.230
I love Spencer, but he can
be such a wanker sometimes.

01:05:02.230 --> 01:05:04.150
Oh, no, don't worry about it.

01:05:04.670 --> 01:05:08.710
I know I probably shouldn't say this,
but it was actually quite exciting.

01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:11.100
Like Roman gladiators
or something and that...

01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:15.800
I've been dying to do that for so long.

01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:19.440
Oh, please don't.

01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:21.960
What? We did it before.

01:05:22.140 --> 01:05:24.960
We've got a big day tomorrow. Can
we just talk about this some other...

01:05:25.050 --> 01:05:27.050
I love you, Alice.

01:05:29.430 --> 01:05:30.910
At least, I think I do.

01:05:32.250 --> 01:05:34.950
I thought that we had
something. Didn't we, Alice?

01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:40.470
Some kind of chemistry, or
electricity, or whatever but...

01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:46.340
All right, mate?

01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:53.290
We were talking...

01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:00.490
Bri, Bri.

01:06:02.150 --> 01:06:05.580
Look, I know you might not believe this,
I was actually putting a good word for you.

01:06:05.710 --> 01:06:07.450
Spencer, mate, you were half-naked.

01:06:07.580 --> 01:06:10.360
We was only fooling around,
it's nothing serious.

01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:16.530
Look, Bri, if you've got something to
say, just say it 'cause this is stupid.

01:06:17.580 --> 01:06:20.180
You knew how I felt about her.

01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:24.000
You knew, Spence. I told you. And
you couldn't keep away, could you?

01:06:24.130 --> 01:06:26.430
- She started it.
- Well, that's all right then, isn't it?

01:06:26.530 --> 01:06:29.130
And what about the fight? Was
that somebody else's fault as well?

01:06:29.130 --> 01:06:31.130
What do you expect? He was
trying to make me look stupid.

01:06:31.210 --> 01:06:32.560
So you resorted to violence?

01:06:32.650 --> 01:06:34.430
No, I didn't resort to it.
Violence was my first choice.

01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:36.510
All right, that's cool.
That's very hard, mate.

01:06:36.650 --> 01:06:40.160
Well, I didn't exactly see you going
out of your way to help me, did I, Judas?

01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:42.860
- I was sticking up for you!
- Oh, that's what you were doing.

01:06:42.980 --> 01:06:44.760
You see, for a moment I
thought you were just flapping

01:06:44.860 --> 01:06:47.460
your social conscience around
in front of your girlfriend!

01:06:47.550 --> 01:06:50.070
You made me feel like a prick, Bri.

01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:52.890
- You are a prick.
- Don't push your luck, Jackson.

01:06:52.980 --> 01:06:55.810
What is it, Spencer, this
need to smash things up?

01:06:55.890 --> 01:06:58.110
You know, it's all very well
messing your own life up,

01:06:58.190 --> 01:07:00.280
but why do you have to do it with
people that care about themselves?

01:07:00.370 --> 01:07:02.590
People who're trying
to achieve something,

01:07:02.670 --> 01:07:05.580
- make something of their lives?
- What, like you, you mean?

01:07:06.620 --> 01:07:09.660
- You're just jealous of me.
- Jealous? What, of you?

01:07:10.180 --> 01:07:13.480
You think because you read a couple
books you're suddenly better than me?

01:07:13.620 --> 01:07:15.180
That's not what Alice seems to think.

01:07:23.180 --> 01:07:26.210
I want you gone, Spencer. I
want you on the first train.

01:07:26.210 --> 01:07:29.130
I don't care how much trouble
you're in. You've gotta go.

01:07:29.870 --> 01:07:33.300
Brian. Where are you going, Brian?

01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:40.160
I'm sorry.

01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:47.160
Wake up! We have to be in
Manchester in two hours.

01:07:47.460 --> 01:07:48.720
Brian!

01:07:52.550 --> 01:07:54.330
Two minutes, Brian.

01:07:59.020 --> 01:08:03.490
Patrick, if it's any consolation,
I'm sure they can cover that up

01:08:03.630 --> 01:08:05.880
- with make-up or...
- Just get in, will you?

01:08:09.020 --> 01:08:10.280
Hey, there.

01:08:13.620 --> 01:08:15.790
Here we are then, the Fantastic Four.

01:08:22.270 --> 01:08:25.470
The duodenum and ileum form
part of which bodily system?

01:08:25.569 --> 01:08:27.130
- The digestive system.
- Correct.

01:08:27.270 --> 01:08:30.470
<i>The Wild Duck and Rosmersholm
are by which Nordic playwright?</i>

01:08:30.609 --> 01:08:34.560
Patrick, can I just ask, do you think
by some kind of freakish coincidence,

01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:36.430
these questions are
going to be on the show?

01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:39.560
Because if they're not, it's a
bit of a waste of time, isn't it?

01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:43.380
It's a warm-up, Brian, for those of us
who aren't feeling too fresh this morning.

01:08:43.510 --> 01:08:46.420
What about Alice, then?
Late night was it, Alice?

01:08:46.510 --> 01:08:48.810
- Not here, Brian.
- Right, so,

01:08:48.939 --> 01:08:51.720
just the four of us today or
is someone hiding in the back?

01:08:51.850 --> 01:08:53.189
Later, okay?

01:08:53.290 --> 01:08:55.510
Will someone please tell
me what the hell's going on?

01:08:55.590 --> 01:08:57.670
I know. Let's listen to some music.

01:09:17.140 --> 01:09:19.529
Finally. I'll let them know you're here.

01:09:20.700 --> 01:09:22.130
Brian, where are you going?

01:09:22.270 --> 01:09:24.350
Just give me five minutes. All right?

01:09:24.350 --> 01:09:26.430
- We're already late because of you.
- Leave him, Patrick.

01:09:26.529 --> 01:09:28.910
All right. But five minutes only.

01:09:30.779 --> 01:09:32.260
Mum, it's not for hours yet.

01:09:32.340 --> 01:09:35.600
I know. We set off at dawn. We
thought we'd make a day of it.

01:09:35.689 --> 01:09:37.160
I brought Des along.
You don't mind, do you?

01:09:37.260 --> 01:09:38.729
No. No, that's fine.

01:09:39.340 --> 01:09:42.250
- What do you think, Bri?
- I've got to go.

01:09:43.819 --> 01:09:45.600
Brian, is something wrong?

01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:47.680
What could possibly be wrong, Mum?

01:09:47.770 --> 01:09:49.770
Is it Des, Brian?

01:09:49.850 --> 01:09:53.290
Brian? Get back here
this minute, young man!

01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:02.060
Brian, I wish your Dad
was here today, too.

01:10:02.150 --> 01:10:03.930
But that's not going to happen, is it?

01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:07.580
I'm sorry you don't like Des, but I do.

01:10:07.660 --> 01:10:10.490
And he likes me. And he makes me laugh.

01:10:10.580 --> 01:10:13.700
Which, believe me, hasn't happened
much in the last ten years.

01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:15.790
Jackson, we're waiting.

01:10:17.270 --> 01:10:18.390
Now!

01:10:20.490 --> 01:10:22.050
I've gotta go.

01:10:26.610 --> 01:10:28.390
Everything all right?

01:10:31.430 --> 01:10:34.120
Brian, I can't stand
this, us not talking.

01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:36.120
What is there to talk about, Alice?

01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:42.680
I'm sorry if I led you on.
And I'm sorry about Spencer.

01:10:42.900 --> 01:10:49.770
I didn't intend to, it was just a sort
of physical, animal attraction. Sex thing.

01:10:49.770 --> 01:10:52.070
This isn't necessarily
helping me, Alice.

01:10:59.020 --> 01:11:00.280
Oh, my God.

01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:07.440
So.

01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:10.580
We meet again.

01:11:20.270 --> 01:11:21.830
Isn't that the team that...

01:11:21.950 --> 01:11:23.690
Beat us last year. Yes,
Lucy, that's correct.

01:11:23.830 --> 01:11:25.690
Okay, people, let's quiz.

01:11:26.740 --> 01:11:29.130
- How many vertices has a dodecahedron?
- Twelve.

01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:30.780
Wrong. Minus five points.

01:11:30.910 --> 01:11:32.690
So they're really,
really good, aren't they?

01:11:32.780 --> 01:11:35.600
- The so called Hammer of the Scots, which...
- Henry II.

01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:38.080
Minus ten points.

01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:40.300
- So basically we're screwed.
- Edward II?

01:11:40.380 --> 01:11:43.420
Okay, Brian, here's a question for
you. If you don't know the answer,

01:11:43.510 --> 01:11:45.470
why the hell do you bother
even opening your mouth?

01:11:45.590 --> 01:11:47.990
Nobody else was answering so I
thought I might as well have a stab.

01:11:48.070 --> 01:11:49.470
Okay, everyone, let's just calm down.

01:11:49.550 --> 01:11:52.770
That's your problem, isn't it?
Always having a stab without a clue.

01:11:52.890 --> 01:11:55.150
Stab, stab, stab, getting everything
wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong!

01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:56.630
- I'm off to find a pub.
- It's fun, remember?

01:11:56.720 --> 01:11:58.800
I don't even know why I let you
on this team in the first place.

01:11:58.930 --> 01:12:00.360
You are completely ignorant.

01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:02.450
Worse even than that thick
yob of a friend of yours.

01:12:02.450 --> 01:12:04.660
- You started that.
- You turn up drunk, reeking of booze

01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:07.280
- Iooking like a tramp on national television.
- Don't do that, Patrick.

01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:09.440
It's true what they say, isn't it?
You can take the boy out of Essex,

01:12:09.540 --> 01:12:11.100
but you can't take Essex out of a boy.

01:12:14.010 --> 01:12:15.400
Ow!

01:12:33.220 --> 01:12:36.730
Of course, what we witness
here is a basic misunderstanding

01:12:36.820 --> 01:12:38.600
of the principle of the headbutt.

01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:43.290
You're meant to hit the
soft part of their nose

01:12:43.420 --> 01:12:46.410
with hard part of your forehead,
not the other way around.

01:12:46.510 --> 01:12:49.330
Here, here, how many
fingers am I holding up?

01:12:49.470 --> 01:12:52.460
- lf I get it wrong, do I lose five points?
- No, not this time.

01:12:53.630 --> 01:12:54.760
Three.

01:12:54.850 --> 01:12:56.330
Battle of Agincourt?

01:12:57.370 --> 01:12:58.720
1415.

01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:01.020
Yeah, I think you're gonna be all right.

01:13:04.540 --> 01:13:06.320
I'm glad you came.

01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:11.750
What, you lying unconscious
in a pool of your own blood?

01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:14.230
Wouldn't have missed that for the world.

01:13:17.650 --> 01:13:20.170
Mr Jackson, we need you now.

01:13:20.270 --> 01:13:21.530
All right.

01:13:22.650 --> 01:13:28.390
Oh, and this is for you. I managed
to get most of the blood out.

01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:30.260
Thank you so much.

01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:33.380
Yeah?

01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:37.380
Yeah. Oh, hang on, you might
want to... Here, let me.

01:13:42.990 --> 01:13:44.990
That's all right.

01:13:45.810 --> 01:13:47.770
Now, Mr Jackson.

01:13:49.630 --> 01:13:51.200
Wait... Brian,

01:13:52.980 --> 01:13:55.800
you show those stuck-up
bastards what you're made of.

01:14:00.580 --> 01:14:04.760
- lf you'd like to wait here.
- Okay.

01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:08.180
Ah, there's Bamber. Wait here please.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:27.260
Oh, my God.

01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:43.590
<i>Which constellation of seven bright
stars includes Merak, Megrez and Mizar?</i>

01:14:44.030 --> 01:14:47.770
<i>Ursa Major or the Great Bear,
also known as the Big Dipper.</i>

01:14:48.290 --> 01:14:49.630
I knew that.

01:15:01.020 --> 01:15:02.450
Oh.

01:15:02.450 --> 01:15:04.320
There it is.

01:15:04.450 --> 01:15:06.230
Okay, everybody. Two minutes.

01:15:19.350 --> 01:15:21.130
I'm sorry about that.

01:15:21.220 --> 01:15:25.780
It's all right. In retrospect, it's
possible I wasn't entirely faultless.

01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:31.820
What?

01:15:32.780 --> 01:15:35.160
You think it's too much?

01:15:35.380 --> 01:15:38.070
Okay. If you'd like to take your seats?

01:15:41.510 --> 01:15:42.890
All right, team.

01:15:44.770 --> 01:15:47.070
Let's take these mothers out!

01:16:04.540 --> 01:16:08.710
Coming to the studio
live in three, two, one...

01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:10.190
Intro Bamber.

01:16:10.190 --> 01:16:15.050
<i>It's University Challenge. Asking
questions, Bamber Gascoigne.</i>

01:16:15.180 --> 01:16:18.090
<i>Hello, welcome once again
to University Challenge.</i>

01:16:18.090 --> 01:16:20.480
This week's tournament between
the University of Bristol

01:16:20.610 --> 01:16:22.560
and Queens' College,
Cambridge. Let's meet the teams.

01:16:22.650 --> 01:16:24.040
Starting with Queens'.

01:16:24.130 --> 01:16:27.700
Hello, I'm Tristram Neville from
Cheltenham, reading Pure Mathematics.

01:16:27.700 --> 01:16:31.000
Hi, my name's Cordelia Sykes
from Norwich reading Chemistry.

01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:32.470
And their team captain.

01:16:32.470 --> 01:16:35.170
Anthony Salmon from Winchester
doing postgraduate research

01:16:35.170 --> 01:16:36.950
in medieval French Literature.

01:16:37.030 --> 01:16:40.170
Nigel De Havilland from West
Dulwich reading economics.

01:16:42.250 --> 01:16:43.730
And our team from Bristol.

01:16:43.810 --> 01:16:48.110
Hi, I'm Alice Harbinson from
Hampstead, London, reading Drama.

01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:51.940
Brian Jackson from Southend in Essex
and I'm reading English Literature.

01:16:52.070 --> 01:16:53.110
And the team captain.

01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:56.620
Patrick Watts, Ashton-under-Lyne,
postgraduate in Mechanical Engineering.

01:16:57.160 --> 01:17:00.190
And my name is Lucy Chang from
Minneapolis, reading Medicine.

01:17:02.450 --> 01:17:08.100
Without further ado, here's your first starter
for ten. Listen carefully before you buzz.

01:17:08.100 --> 01:17:11.230
For a straight line graph of Y against
X where the gradient of the line is two

01:17:11.230 --> 01:17:13.920
and the Y intercept is five, what
is the value of Y when X is ten?

01:17:14.050 --> 01:17:15.270
Salmon, Queens'.

01:17:15.390 --> 01:17:17.480
- Twenty five.
- Correct for ten points.

01:17:17.570 --> 01:17:21.220
So Queens', three bonus
questions on electron microscopy.

01:17:23.610 --> 01:17:26.520
What was identified by Hegel
as the tendency of a concept

01:17:26.660 --> 01:17:30.170
to pass over into its own negation as
the result of conflict between its...

01:17:30.300 --> 01:17:31.640
Watts, Bristol.

01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:37.470
- I'm sorry, I don't know the answer.
- Well, I'm afraid you lose five points.

01:17:37.470 --> 01:17:38.590
Salmon, Queens'.

01:17:38.730 --> 01:17:40.590
- Is it dialectics?
- Dialectics indeed.

01:17:40.690 --> 01:17:42.890
So three more questions for you.

01:17:45.590 --> 01:17:47.980
- Chang, Bristol.
- The adrenal gland?

01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:49.760
Correct. Puts you back in the game.

01:17:49.850 --> 01:17:52.160
Three bonus questions on geography.

01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:54.540
Which is the only African
country to have a coastline

01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:56.620
on both the Atlantic
and the Mediterranean?

01:18:00.060 --> 01:18:01.230
Algeria.

01:18:01.410 --> 01:18:02.580
I have to hurry you.

01:18:03.930 --> 01:18:05.190
Algeria.

01:18:05.190 --> 01:18:07.450
No, I'm afraid the answer is Morocco.

01:18:09.530 --> 01:18:11.610
Now, look at your monitors.

01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:15.270
Watts, Bristol.

01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:17.870
- Durham Cathedral.
- No, I'm afraid that's incorrect.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.090
- Sykes, Queens'.
- York Minster?

01:18:20.180 --> 01:18:21.960
Is the correct answer.

01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:24.560
- De Havilland, Queens'.
- Calcium carbonate.

01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:26.740
Incorrect. I'm afraid
you lose five points.

01:18:26.820 --> 01:18:28.740
- Jackson, Bristol.
- Calcium sulphate.

01:18:28.740 --> 01:18:30.690
Calcium sulphate is correct.

01:18:34.860 --> 01:18:37.380
<i>It's the Oresteia by Aeschylus.</i>

01:18:37.470 --> 01:18:39.470
<i>The Oresteia by Aeschylus.</i>

01:18:39.550 --> 01:18:41.420
- Correct.
- The Euclidian Algorithm.

01:18:41.510 --> 01:18:43.200
- The Euclidian Algorithm.
- Correct.

01:18:43.290 --> 01:18:44.640
<i>Honi soit qui mal y pense.</i>

01:18:44.770 --> 01:18:47.590
<i>- Honi soit qui mal y pense?
- Is the correct answer.</i>

01:18:56.940 --> 01:18:59.970
- Salmon, Queens'.
- The overture from Mozart's Cosi Fan Tutte.

01:19:02.450 --> 01:19:06.010
<i>The mucus membrane. Oxidization.
The Siege of Krishnapur.</i>

01:19:06.100 --> 01:19:09.230
- Is it an Oxbow lake?
- It is indeed an Oxbow lake.

01:19:13.010 --> 01:19:14.220
Oh, let's just go home.

01:19:14.350 --> 01:19:15.920
There still may be
just time to catch up,

01:19:16.010 --> 01:19:17.790
so here's another starter
question for ten points.

01:19:17.870 --> 01:19:21.520
Derived from the Greek words for
wing and finger, what is the genus...

01:19:21.660 --> 01:19:23.400
Jackson, Bristol.

01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:25.390
- Pterodactyl.
- Is correct.

01:19:31.650 --> 01:19:32.990
Schlemm's canal,

01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:35.390
the ora serrata,

01:19:35.990 --> 01:19:40.810
- and is it the fovea centralis?
- It is indeed.

01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:45.380
Which American poet
and Fulbright Scholar...

01:19:45.380 --> 01:19:47.460
- Harbinson, Bristol.
- Plath! Sylvia Plath.

01:19:47.590 --> 01:19:50.200
Sylvia Plath is correct so
three more questions for you

01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:52.240
on quotations from Shakespeare.

01:19:52.380 --> 01:19:53.720
<i>- Twelfth Night.
- Twelfth Night.</i>

01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:56.020
<i>- Correct.
- Much Ado.</i>

01:19:56.100 --> 01:19:57.970
<i>- Much Ado About Nothing.
- Correct.</i>

01:19:58.100 --> 01:19:59.230
<i>- Henry V.
- The IV.</i>

01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:00.490
Which is it?

01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:02.970
Come on.

01:20:03.100 --> 01:20:04.890
Go with Brian.

01:20:05.410 --> 01:20:08.830
<i>- Is the answer King Henry V?
- Is the correct answer.</i>

01:20:10.190 --> 01:20:12.270
<i>- Jackson, Bristol.
- The battleship Potemkin.</i>

01:20:12.350 --> 01:20:14.050
- Correct.
- Jackson, Bristol.

01:20:14.140 --> 01:20:15.610
- The Treaty of Versailles.
- Correct.

01:20:15.700 --> 01:20:16.830
Watts, Bristol.

01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:20.180
- It's a form of fungal infection.
- Is the correct answer.

01:20:24.040 --> 01:20:26.220
- Jackson, Bristol.
- Electroluminescence,

01:20:28.910 --> 01:20:30.820
candleluminescence,

01:20:34.130 --> 01:20:35.470
luminescence,

01:20:36.210 --> 01:20:37.550
phosphorescence...

01:20:39.850 --> 01:20:41.120
Come on.

01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:44.120
- Incandescence.
- All correct. Amazing recovery.

01:20:48.420 --> 01:20:51.240
All to play for now, just five points
behind with one minute on the clock.

01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:53.100
For ten points, on a
question on astronomy.

01:20:53.100 --> 01:20:55.800
- Jackson, Bristol.
- Ursa Major, or The Great Bear.

01:21:08.010 --> 01:21:09.530
The Big Dipper?

01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:18.400
Rather amazingly, that is the correct
answer, so perhaps we'd better stop recording.

01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:24.040
- What just happened?
- I don't know.

01:21:24.130 --> 01:21:26.740
Does anyone know what
the hell just happened?

01:21:26.820 --> 01:21:28.910
Does anybody know how he knew the answer

01:21:28.910 --> 01:21:31.430
when I didn't even ask
him the bloody question?

01:22:22.180 --> 01:22:24.130
Can we just get going, please?

01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:52.890
Brian, we'll laugh about this one day.

01:23:27.390 --> 01:23:28.510
Hello.

01:23:29.770 --> 01:23:31.870
I'll just see if he's here.

01:23:36.340 --> 01:23:37.900
No, I'm sorry.

01:23:38.210 --> 01:23:41.200
I'll tell him you called. Bye.

01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:46.420
I don't know why you won't talk to her.

01:23:46.860 --> 01:23:50.060
You know why not. I made
a complete idiot of myself.

01:23:50.280 --> 01:23:51.760
No, you didn't.

01:23:51.850 --> 01:23:53.800
Mum, you were there, remember?

01:23:53.930 --> 01:23:55.800
All right, you made a prat of yourself.

01:23:55.890 --> 01:23:57.060
Thanks, Mum.

01:23:57.150 --> 01:23:58.930
Look, Brian.

01:23:58.930 --> 01:24:02.570
The people who really care about
you don't mind if you make mistakes.

01:24:02.790 --> 01:24:04.670
It's what you do next that matters.

01:24:05.490 --> 01:24:07.360
And if you can't see that,

01:24:07.490 --> 01:24:09.960
then you're not as smart
as I thought you were.

01:24:52.370 --> 01:24:54.230
There's someone here to see you.

01:24:55.710 --> 01:24:57.150
I can't, Mum.

01:24:58.410 --> 01:25:01.530
Brian, you've been moping around
for weeks now and I'm not having it.

01:25:01.630 --> 01:25:04.140
There's been far too much of
that already in this house.

01:25:07.790 --> 01:25:10.620
It's Spencer. I'm not going
to tell him to go away.

01:25:17.700 --> 01:25:20.090
Never thought I'd see the
day you were wearing a suit.

01:25:20.180 --> 01:25:23.610
The magistrate liked it. She only
gave me six months' probation.

01:25:31.340 --> 01:25:33.730
Hiding in the wardrobe, Spence.

01:25:36.120 --> 01:25:37.460
It's not funny.

01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:40.680
Well, maybe you weren't
so perfect yourself, mate.

01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:43.720
I suppose not.

01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:50.590
What're you still doing here, Bri?

01:25:51.410 --> 01:25:54.150
- What do you mean?
- Well, why haven't you gone back yet?

01:25:54.150 --> 01:25:55.890
I've gone off the idea.

01:25:58.630 --> 01:26:01.010
Besides, it's all a waste of time.

01:26:01.010 --> 01:26:03.100
How can it be a waste of time?

01:26:03.100 --> 01:26:04.750
You've changed your tune.

01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:10.920
It was a waste of time for someone
like me, but you, you love it.

01:26:11.220 --> 01:26:13.400
Maybe I'm just not as
clever as I thought I was.

01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:15.090
Of course you're clever.

01:26:16.660 --> 01:26:20.610
It's just every now and then you
do some stupid things, that's all.

01:26:25.610 --> 01:26:27.170
I got you this.

01:26:32.250 --> 01:26:33.730
Thanks, Spence.

01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:35.380
Cheers.

01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:38.500
It's only a tape, Brian. No
need to get all gay about it.

01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:45.280
I'll see you soon, yeah?

01:27:26.350 --> 01:27:27.770
Do you need more towels?

01:27:27.910 --> 01:27:29.340
I've got towels, Mum.

01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:31.950
Bread? Sugar? Bag of potatoes?

01:27:34.120 --> 01:27:36.030
Bye, Mum.

01:27:37.460 --> 01:27:39.340
See you, Des.

01:27:40.600 --> 01:27:41.720
See you, Bri.

01:27:43.500 --> 01:27:45.070
All right.

01:27:46.330 --> 01:27:47.460
Brian.

01:27:49.670 --> 01:27:54.370
Don't take this the wrong way, but
I'm really glad to see the back of you.

01:28:01.010 --> 01:28:03.700
Remember. Fresh fruit.

01:28:11.830 --> 01:28:17.260
<i>I admit it. I've made some
mistakes. Okay, some big mistakes.</i>

01:28:17.870 --> 01:28:19.570
<i>Loads of them.</i>

01:28:19.650 --> 01:28:23.090
<i>But you can't hide in your room
forever feeling sorry for yourself.</i>

01:28:23.730 --> 01:28:25.610
<i>It's not practical.</i>

01:28:25.690 --> 01:28:29.560
<i>At some point you've got to get
back out there, face up to things,</i>

01:28:29.650 --> 01:28:31.860
<i>and confront your demons.</i>

01:28:31.950 --> 01:28:34.860
Well, well. Mr Jackson.

01:28:34.990 --> 01:28:37.680
Could this possibly mean you're back?

01:28:39.340 --> 01:28:40.680
Yes, if...

01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:45.590
So, we'll see you tomorrow, then.

01:28:48.110 --> 01:28:49.550
Thank you, Doctor.

01:28:53.850 --> 01:28:57.970
<i>And yes, I've made some
bad choices, lost my head.</i>

01:28:58.100 --> 01:29:01.320
<i>Let people down. People I care for.</i>

01:29:01.840 --> 01:29:04.580
<i>But there still might be
time to get something right.</i>

01:29:07.140 --> 01:29:08.620
You came back.

01:29:09.580 --> 01:29:12.260
Oh, I'm so glad you came.

01:29:13.090 --> 01:29:16.130
Now listen, you mustn't worry about
what people are going to say, okay?

01:29:16.220 --> 01:29:18.000
So you made a silly
mistake. But the thing is...

01:29:18.090 --> 01:29:22.910
Can I just stop you there for a minute, Alice?
I'm sorry, but I'm looking for someone else.

01:29:28.430 --> 01:29:31.730
<i>Ever since I can remember,
I've wanted to be clever.</i>

01:29:31.860 --> 01:29:35.600
<i>Some people are born clever the same
way some people are born beautiful.</i>

01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:38.940
<i>I'm not one of those people.
I'm gonna have to work at it.</i>

01:29:38.940 --> 01:29:42.770
<i>Put in the effort. And if I
mess it up, I'll learn from it.</i>

01:29:42.900 --> 01:29:46.850
<i>Besides, sometimes it's not
about knowing the right answer.</i>

01:29:47.290 --> 01:29:50.290
<i>Sometimes it's about
asking the right question.</i>

01:29:50.370 --> 01:29:53.330
<i>We want the money spent on
nuclear weapons to be brought</i>

01:29:53.330 --> 01:29:57.800
<i>into our health system.
Our nurseries and schools.</i>

01:29:57.890 --> 01:29:59.540
<i>Our universities.</i>

01:30:00.580 --> 01:30:01.750
<i>What do we want?</i>

01:30:01.840 --> 01:30:03.020
Nukes out.

01:30:03.100 --> 01:30:04.360
<i>- When do we want it?
- Now.</i>

01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:06.220
<i>- What do we want?
- Nukes out!</i>

01:30:06.220 --> 01:30:07.880
<i>- When do we want it?
- Now!</i>

01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:09.440
<i>- What do we want?
- Nukes out!</i>

01:30:09.570 --> 01:30:11.220
<i>- When do we want it?
- Now!</i>

01:30:20.610 --> 01:30:21.730
Hello.

01:30:22.690 --> 01:30:23.950
Hello.

01:30:24.780 --> 01:30:26.340
Think we could talk?

01:30:26.430 --> 01:30:29.260
Somewhere a bit less angry?

01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:32.900
All right. Yeah.

01:30:38.510 --> 01:30:42.460
You've got a nerve, Brian Jackson,
not answering my phone calls.

01:30:42.590 --> 01:30:46.410
Look, I know. And I'm
sorry. I just... I wanted to.

01:30:46.410 --> 01:30:49.150
I just needed time to
make sense of everything.

01:30:49.230 --> 01:30:52.670
I see. So does
everything make sense now?

01:30:53.190 --> 01:30:56.840
Yeah, almost. I just need
to ask you one question.

01:30:59.970 --> 01:31:03.920
Okay. One question. Ten points.

01:31:05.480 --> 01:31:07.480
You think you can forgive me?

01:31:08.310 --> 01:31:13.010
For all the mistakes, all the
wrong answers and stupid remarks?

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.300
Brian, you already know the answer.
