01:25.319 --> 01:28.556
So, Abigail, your parents

01:28.589 --> 01:33.427
and I feel like
it would be better

01:33.461 --> 01:38.098
if you started school
with the rest of your class
this year.

01:39.500 --> 01:41.269
Why?

01:41.302 --> 01:44.272
Honey, we just think that
the more time that goes by,

01:44.305 --> 01:46.407
the harder it will be
for you to go back.

01:46.440 --> 01:49.543
This way you can start off the
year just like everyone else.

01:49.577 --> 01:56.417
Exactly, it'll certainly
make the transition easier
if you're ready.

01:56.450 --> 01:57.785
She's ready.

01:57.818 --> 02:01.422
Okay. Great.

[rap music]

02:14.835 --> 02:16.870
Come on.

02:16.904 --> 02:19.440
Shuttle leaves in
20 minutes, alright?

02:22.776 --> 02:24.745
Listen, you're not in
that bathroom in a minute,

02:24.778 --> 02:26.314
I'm taking a shower,

02:26.347 --> 02:29.717
so move it or lose it, let's go.

02:31.219 --> 02:33.687
You're not wearing
that to school.

02:33.721 --> 02:35.489
These are pajamas, Robert.

02:35.523 --> 02:37.425
[Robert] Alright.

02:39.293 --> 02:43.231

02:43.264 --> 02:44.898
Oh my god, these are precious!

02:44.932 --> 02:46.334
Yeah, right?

02:46.367 --> 02:47.701
Do you remember
when you wore that boa?

02:47.735 --> 02:48.702
Every day.

02:48.736 --> 02:49.837
Every single day.

02:49.870 --> 02:51.739
I still would, honestly.

02:51.772 --> 02:53.474
Aw, man.

02:53.507 --> 02:56.210
-Dude, so I'm making--
-Nice skirt, slut!

02:56.244 --> 02:57.445
[squealing]

02:59.780 --> 03:01.382
Ellie, you know Melissa, right?

03:01.415 --> 03:03.651
Oh, uh, Sophie
told me you guys

03:03.684 --> 03:04.652
had a lot of fun at cheer camp.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.854
Aw!

03:06.887 --> 03:09.323
Oh shit,
Armani texted me last night.

03:09.357 --> 03:10.724
-No!
-Yeah.

03:10.758 --> 03:12.726
-What'd he say?
-He invited me, I shit you not,

03:12.760 --> 03:14.762
-he invited me to
an art gallery.
-Oh my god, are you gonna go?

03:14.795 --> 03:16.830
-Fuck no!
-[laughing]

03:16.864 --> 03:18.266
Sophie.

03:22.436 --> 03:24.805
Oh my god,
oh my god, she's back.

03:24.838 --> 03:26.507
What?

03:26.540 --> 03:28.409
We were in her
psych class last year.

03:29.410 --> 03:31.945
Oh shit, that girl.

03:31.979 --> 03:33.614
Hey, what was that name

03:33.647 --> 03:35.849
-everybody kept calling
her last year?
-Sybil.

03:35.883 --> 03:38.419
-Oh my god,
she's gonna be right over here,
her locker's right next to mine.

03:38.452 --> 03:39.520
Where?

03:43.524 --> 03:45.526
What is she doing?

03:49.563 --> 03:52.433
-Melissa, what the fuck?
-Stop!

03:52.466 --> 03:53.534
Guys.

03:59.707 --> 04:01.542
Welcome back, Sybil.

04:03.444 --> 04:05.045
Sorry.

04:05.078 --> 04:07.381
She loves it, trust me.

04:26.767 --> 04:30.371
I do, as I said...

04:31.405 --> 04:33.407
have my glass collection.

04:35.075 --> 04:39.480
Most of them are little animals
made out of glass.

04:39.513 --> 04:42.650
Tiniest little animals
in the world.

04:44.117 --> 04:47.054
Mother calls them
the glass menagerie.

04:49.390 --> 04:52.826
This is one of the oldest,
he's nearly 13.

04:52.860 --> 04:54.328
What the fuck
is she talking about?

04:54.362 --> 04:57.398
Be careful,
if you breathe, it breaks.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.602
Nice job.

05:01.635 --> 05:05.038
I'm glad somebody
read the play this summer.

05:05.072 --> 05:06.807
Who is next?

05:08.008 --> 05:09.510
Melissa.

05:12.112 --> 05:13.347
Melissa?

05:17.117 --> 05:20.688
-He's so gross, disgusting.
-He's like a dog.

05:20.721 --> 05:24.425
Oh, look,
it's Laura Wingfield.

05:24.458 --> 05:25.793
Who?

05:26.627 --> 05:27.928
Sybil.

05:27.961 --> 05:29.129
Laura's this character
from this play

05:29.162 --> 05:31.532
we were supposed to read
over the summer.

05:31.565 --> 05:33.133
See the limp?

05:33.166 --> 05:34.702
Wait, she has a limp?

05:34.735 --> 05:36.437
Well, Laura has a limp.

05:36.470 --> 05:38.071
Oh my god.

05:38.105 --> 05:40.541
You know she was in a psych ward
for like six months, right?

05:40.574 --> 05:42.410
No, wait, what?

05:42.443 --> 05:44.412
Where did you hear that?

05:44.445 --> 05:45.879
Ugh, fuck, I need a cigarette.

05:45.913 --> 05:49.617
Oh my god, the first day back
always kills me.

You don't understand!
I have a business

06:46.039 --> 06:47.708
and then I have a
personal account.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.610
Why you'd dip into a
personal account I--

-[muffled yelling continues]

07:15.836 --> 07:18.071
[Robert] This has gone on
for two weeks now,

07:18.105 --> 07:20.140
I'm so tired of this guy.

07:21.208 --> 07:23.777
No, hey, no.

07:29.249 --> 07:31.118
Sorry, that was not for you.

08:07.755 --> 08:09.089
That's better.

08:48.929 --> 08:55.603
We took psych together
last year, remember, yeah?

08:55.636 --> 08:59.039
But hey listen,
I just wanted to come over

08:59.072 --> 09:02.610
and tell you that I think

09:02.643 --> 09:05.012
it's really brave
that you came back.

09:05.045 --> 09:08.015
I mean,
I think you're pretty cool.

09:11.051 --> 09:14.755
So I was just wondering,

09:14.788 --> 09:16.356
if it was okay with you,

09:16.389 --> 09:20.828
maybe I could
give you a call sometime?

09:20.861 --> 09:22.630
You got a number?

09:28.736 --> 09:31.772
So do I get to request
which personality I take out?

09:31.805 --> 09:33.607
[laughing]

10:06.306 --> 10:08.876
Hey, guys,
my name is Jeremy Woods

10:08.909 --> 10:13.213
and I'm filling in
for Mrs. Howell
'til the end of October.

10:13.246 --> 10:16.950
Now, I know she went into labor
a few weeks early.

10:16.984 --> 10:19.419
Excuse me.

10:19.452 --> 10:22.022
But don't worry,
she left me with her syllabus

10:22.055 --> 10:25.358
and, uh, there you go.

10:26.694 --> 10:27.795
Hi.

10:29.797 --> 10:31.364
There you go.
What's your name?

10:31.398 --> 10:33.366
-Sybil.
-Sybil.

10:36.804 --> 10:38.739
Abigail.

10:38.772 --> 10:40.073
Hi Abigail, I'm Jeremy.

10:40.107 --> 10:42.375
Uh, you're late,
do you have a pass?

10:44.745 --> 10:46.780
You always gotta
get the pass, Schue.

10:46.814 --> 10:50.350
Okay, you're gonna have to
head back to guidance
and get one.

10:50.383 --> 10:52.152
[laughter]

10:52.185 --> 10:53.921
I'm only joking, though.

10:53.954 --> 10:56.957
I'm joking around with you,
come on, have a seat.

11:03.096 --> 11:05.198
Welcome.

11:05.232 --> 11:08.869
Alright, now I know you guys
were working on
"The Glass Menagerie"

11:08.902 --> 11:11.138
for the showcase
but I don't know,

11:11.171 --> 11:13.974
"Glass Menagerie",
I'd like to change it up a bit.

11:14.007 --> 11:17.010
Anybody here ever read
"The Crucible"?

11:18.278 --> 11:20.113
Guys in the back?

11:20.147 --> 11:23.416
You guys ever read
"The Crucible"? Arthur Miller?

11:23.450 --> 11:25.085
-I do not recall...
-Maybe.

11:25.118 --> 11:27.921
-...reading that actually.
-No.

11:27.955 --> 11:29.823
You guys ever read any
Arthur Miller in here at all?

11:29.857 --> 11:31.925
Death of a Salesman,
All My Sons, no?

11:31.959 --> 11:35.262
Well, he's a great playwright
and you should be studying him.

11:35.295 --> 11:37.330
Let's read, guys!

11:37.364 --> 11:39.432
[quiet laughter]

11:39.466 --> 11:42.302
Okay, I see how it's gonna go.

11:42.335 --> 11:45.806
Um, so, anyway,
"The Crucible" is a great play.

11:45.839 --> 11:49.309
Salem Witch Trials, I think
you're gonna like it a lot.

12:03.290 --> 12:05.859
[microwave running]

12:16.937 --> 12:20.140
[moaning]

12:31.551 --> 12:34.087
So work was good, huh?

12:34.121 --> 12:35.789
Yeah.

12:35.823 --> 12:37.257
Yeah, it was fun.

12:37.290 --> 12:38.458
That's great.

12:38.491 --> 12:41.394
Nice kids.

12:41.428 --> 12:45.332
I'm still trying to wrap
my head around this whole
teaching thing.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.302
Well, it's not really about
the teaching, you know.

12:49.336 --> 12:52.873
It's like, it's more
about being back

12:52.906 --> 12:56.476
in the theater,
and uh, directing.

12:57.911 --> 13:00.113
-Well, that's great.
-Yeah.

13:00.147 --> 13:01.581
You wanna beer or
something before you go?

13:01.614 --> 13:03.483
Oh, no.
I have this conference call

13:03.516 --> 13:07.855
in twenty minutes,
so I should really go.

13:07.888 --> 13:09.789
-Okay.
-Uh...

13:12.359 --> 13:15.228
Oh, right,
I wanted to talk to you.

13:15.262 --> 13:19.967
I was talking to Michael
and he has
a new opening at his office

13:20.000 --> 13:23.503
and I was thinking it would be
great if you guys met, you know?

13:23.536 --> 13:27.474
Maybe we could have drinks
or dinner sometime next week?

13:27.507 --> 13:29.242
Yeah, I'd love to meet him.

13:29.276 --> 13:31.244
Um, I'm not gonna be
available 'til the end

13:31.278 --> 13:33.580
of October 'cause of, you know,
the play and everything.

13:33.613 --> 13:35.548
Right, I know.

13:35.582 --> 13:42.122
But this would be
a more permanent kind of thing,
you know?

13:42.155 --> 13:44.391
It's a great company,
it's a great position.

13:44.424 --> 13:46.193
You guys would really
dig each other.

13:46.226 --> 13:48.061
-I'm just, it's a meeting and--
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:48.095 --> 13:50.063
Can we not do this right now?
'Cause we do it, like, everyday

13:50.097 --> 13:52.465
and, like, I'm actually happy.

13:52.499 --> 13:55.235
I'm sweaty, 'cause it's hot
in here, but I'm happy.

13:55.268 --> 13:57.337
I know.
Alright, I should go.

13:57.370 --> 14:00.473
-Thanks for dinner.
-Thanks for nothing.

14:00.507 --> 14:01.875
I'm joking.

14:01.909 --> 14:03.510
Thanks for coming over.

14:03.543 --> 14:04.844
You're welcome.

14:10.250 --> 14:13.120
[chatter]

14:13.153 --> 14:14.955
Alright, guys.

14:14.988 --> 14:16.423
Guys.

14:16.456 --> 14:18.258
Do you see nail polish?

14:18.291 --> 14:19.659
[chatter continues]

14:19.692 --> 14:22.062
Hello, guys! Guys.

14:22.095 --> 14:24.264
Turn around, c'mon,
class has started.

14:24.297 --> 14:26.967
I wanna kind of talk more about
"The Crucible" and the showcase

14:27.000 --> 14:30.303
and how this is
all gonna work, so.

14:30.337 --> 14:32.372
Uh, we're obviously not gonna be

14:32.405 --> 14:35.175
able to do the whole play
in one period.

14:35.208 --> 14:38.245
So, today, what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna assign some roles,

14:38.278 --> 14:41.514
assign some scenes,
and then I'm gonna put
you guys into groups.

14:41.548 --> 14:44.084
Okay?
Here's how it's gonna work.

14:44.117 --> 14:46.519
The groups that are
the most rehearsed,

14:46.553 --> 14:49.622
that care the most,
those are the scenes we're gonna

14:49.656 --> 14:51.224
pick to do the showcase.

14:51.258 --> 14:53.226
So, I don't know
you guys that well,

14:53.260 --> 14:55.128
but I wanna get to know you.

14:55.162 --> 14:58.531
So, I'm just gonna
start assigning roles

14:58.565 --> 15:00.267
based on who wants to play what.

15:00.300 --> 15:02.302
Let's start with
Elizabeth Proctor.

15:02.335 --> 15:04.137
This is the wife
of the protagonist.

15:04.171 --> 15:05.939
She's accused of witchcraft.

15:05.973 --> 15:10.177
Any seniors wanna maybe
give this a shot?

15:13.013 --> 15:14.381
Okay, you're-- what's your name?

15:14.414 --> 15:15.548
Lily.

15:15.582 --> 15:16.950
Lily, want to give it a shot?

15:16.984 --> 15:19.419
-Sure.
-Great, thank you.

15:19.452 --> 15:21.354
Um, alright, moving down.

15:21.388 --> 15:22.689
Abigail Williams.

15:22.722 --> 15:26.426
Now, this is the villain
of the play, okay?

15:26.459 --> 15:28.428
It's a great role.

15:28.461 --> 15:31.098
She starts having an affair
with John Proctor

15:31.131 --> 15:34.067
and then,
when he wants to stop it,

15:34.101 --> 15:36.003
she seeks revenge on him, okay?

15:36.036 --> 15:38.271
It's a great, great, great part.
It's a difficult part.

15:38.305 --> 15:40.573
Anyone wanna try to tackle that?

15:40.607 --> 15:43.143
You have somebody
in mind, over there?

15:43.176 --> 15:44.644
Well, she should raise her hand.

15:49.149 --> 15:51.218
Put your fucking
hand down, bitch.

15:58.125 --> 16:01.661
Uh, I'm gonna have to go with

16:01.694 --> 16:05.065
the namesake here, Abigail.

16:05.098 --> 16:07.134
-[boys chuckle]
-Oh snap!

16:07.167 --> 16:08.201
How's that feel, Mel?

16:08.235 --> 16:10.003
And what's your name?

16:10.037 --> 16:12.105
-Melissa.
-Melissa.

16:12.139 --> 16:14.307
Why don't you
understudy Abigail for now,

16:14.341 --> 16:16.709
and we'll keep looking
for something else.

16:16.743 --> 16:22.582
Okay, let's move down
to John Proctor, okay?

16:22.615 --> 16:25.552
Any of the fellas?
John Proctor?

16:25.585 --> 16:27.620
Nobody wants to try?

16:28.655 --> 16:31.024
Okay, Eric, right?

16:31.058 --> 16:32.759
-Yup.
-Great.

16:32.792 --> 16:34.427
Eric as John Proctor,

16:34.461 --> 16:37.364
Lily as Elizabeth,

16:37.397 --> 16:39.699
Melissa, you'll be
Abigail's understudy,

16:39.732 --> 16:42.135
and Abigail is Abigail.

16:42.169 --> 16:44.037
-Wait, what?
-Yeah.

16:44.071 --> 16:46.539
-That is so weird.
-I know.

16:46.573 --> 16:48.441
Why would she volunteer
to read with Eric?

16:48.475 --> 16:52.479
-She doesn't even know him.
-Why do you think?

16:52.512 --> 16:54.381
But, like, you don't
think he likes her, right?

16:54.414 --> 16:56.683
-He didn't seem to like--
-I dunno.

16:58.385 --> 17:01.654
I'd just keep
an eye on her, ya know?

17:07.760 --> 17:09.128
Slut.

17:31.484 --> 17:34.087
Only this consider,

17:34.121 --> 17:35.755
the world goes mad,

17:35.788 --> 17:38.258
and it profit nothing you
should lay the cause

17:38.291 --> 17:40.527
to the vengeance
of a little girl.

17:41.194 --> 17:42.362
Come on.

17:45.232 --> 17:46.799
-Is that good?
-It's great.

17:46.833 --> 17:49.102
Yeah? You guys are really,
you're doing the work.

17:49.136 --> 17:50.470
Alright, good.

17:50.503 --> 17:51.738
Lily, I love what
you're doing down there,

17:51.771 --> 17:53.606
with the blocking.
I really like it.

17:53.640 --> 17:56.643
Let's revisit this tomorrow,
but I'm really happy.

17:56.676 --> 17:58.278
Thank you, Mr. Woods.

17:58.311 --> 18:00.380
Thank you.

18:00.413 --> 18:02.782
Abigail and Eric are up next.

18:02.815 --> 18:06.719
Eric, uh, is sick,
so he can't make it.

18:06.753 --> 18:09.088
[panting]

18:10.890 --> 18:12.159
Well, that's okay.

18:12.192 --> 18:14.294
Abigail, why don't you come up?

18:14.327 --> 18:16.229
Come on up, yeah.

18:17.730 --> 18:20.300
Yeah, you can play
both parts, Sybil.

18:24.737 --> 18:27.140
This is Act 2, Scene 2?

18:29.342 --> 18:33.680
Okay, I'll read it with you.

18:38.951 --> 18:40.420
Oh, this should be good.

18:40.453 --> 18:41.688
What a gentleman.

18:41.721 --> 18:42.789
Right.

18:51.498 --> 18:54.567
I must speak with you, Abigail.

18:54.601 --> 18:55.902
Will you sit?

18:57.570 --> 18:58.738
How do you come?

18:59.639 --> 19:00.840
Friendly.

19:03.443 --> 19:05.645
I don't like the woods at night.

19:05.678 --> 19:07.180
Pray you, stand closer.

19:07.214 --> 19:10.550
-Oh, she wants it.
-My god, stand closer.

19:10.583 --> 19:12.885
I knew it must be you.

19:12.919 --> 19:15.555
When I heard the pebbles
on my window,

19:15.588 --> 19:18.191
before I opened up
my eyes, I knew.

19:18.225 --> 19:19.859
I thought you would come
a good time sooner.

19:19.892 --> 19:22.295
[boys laugh]

19:22.329 --> 19:25.298
I had thought to come
many times.

19:25.332 --> 19:28.735
-[laughter continues]
-Why didn't you?

19:28.768 --> 19:31.371
-I am so alone in the world now.
-Are you?

19:32.605 --> 19:33.973
I've heard that people ride

19:34.006 --> 19:36.543
a hundred mile
to see your face these days.

19:36.576 --> 19:39.346
Aye, my face.

19:41.514 --> 19:43.250
Do you see my face?

19:45.452 --> 19:47.587
[bell rings]

19:53.760 --> 19:56.429
Alright, everyone,
great day today.

19:56.463 --> 19:58.465
Thank you, Jeremy.

20:00.933 --> 20:02.835
Abigail, that was,

20:02.869 --> 20:05.238
that was really great!

20:05.272 --> 20:06.439
Thanks.

20:06.473 --> 20:09.409
You definitely,
you worked on this.

20:09.442 --> 20:10.510
Well, you, too.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.612
Well, I, I had practice.

20:12.645 --> 20:14.581
I played the part in college.

20:14.614 --> 20:17.250
-Yeah?
-Yeah, at Mason-Gross?

20:17.284 --> 20:18.751
Oh, wow.

20:18.785 --> 20:21.588
It's a great part.
It's a great play.

20:23.756 --> 20:26.259
Where you headed right now?

20:26.293 --> 20:27.794
Lunch.

20:29.529 --> 20:30.963
Ay yo!

20:31.664 --> 20:32.832
Hey.

20:33.833 --> 20:35.368
What happened in class?

20:35.402 --> 20:36.369
Were you guys hooking up?

20:36.403 --> 20:38.471
-Fuck you.
-You were!

20:38.505 --> 20:41.374
Fuck you!
What happened?

20:41.408 --> 20:44.243
Um, Jeremy read it with her.

20:45.478 --> 20:47.314
That's weird.

20:47.347 --> 20:48.748
Yeah, I thought so, too.

20:48.781 --> 20:49.882
Huh.

20:51.651 --> 20:53.586
Hey, did you see
Eric this morning?

20:53.620 --> 20:54.587
Not yet.

20:54.621 --> 20:56.456
Well, I talked to him,

20:56.489 --> 20:57.624
and I told him how you felt
about everything.

20:57.657 --> 20:58.825
What?

20:58.858 --> 21:00.993
No, just, like,
just that you were

21:01.027 --> 21:03.363
a little bit jealous that
he was working with Abigail.

21:03.396 --> 21:04.897
He didn't even go
to class today.

21:04.931 --> 21:06.366
No!

21:06.399 --> 21:08.034
Yeah, seriously.
He stood her up.

21:08.067 --> 21:09.936
Apparently, Jeremy had to read
the scene with her.

21:09.969 --> 21:12.739
Eww, oh my god,
that's so weird!

21:12.772 --> 21:14.574
And Jeremy actually
acted with her?

21:14.607 --> 21:16.909
Yeah, that's what I said.

21:16.943 --> 21:20.012
Uh, so why are you guys mad
at Abigail again?

21:21.548 --> 21:23.883
'Cause she's a slut.

21:23.916 --> 21:26.786
Oh, thought she was a psycho.

21:28.888 --> 21:30.990
Why are you taking her side?

21:31.023 --> 21:32.659
I'm not, I just--

21:32.692 --> 21:33.993
Yeah, Ellie, like,
what's, what's going on?

21:34.026 --> 21:36.563
Why are you being such a bitch?

21:36.596 --> 21:37.797
Okay.

21:37.830 --> 21:38.998
I gotta go.

23:29.509 --> 23:31.744
[bell rings]

23:31.778 --> 23:34.447
Great day, everyone.
Thank you.

23:34.481 --> 23:36.082
See you tomorrow.

23:43.723 --> 23:45.892
Found that paper.

23:45.925 --> 23:48.895
-Oh, thank you, Melissa.
-No problem.

23:49.729 --> 23:50.930
Abigail?

23:50.963 --> 23:53.800
Uh, just one quick question?

23:53.833 --> 23:54.967
Thank you.

23:59.606 --> 24:02.975
I was wondering if maybe you'd
be interested in helping me out

24:03.009 --> 24:05.812
-with the showcase?
-Yeah.

24:05.845 --> 24:07.880
-Yeah?
-Yeah, I'd love to.

24:07.914 --> 24:11.083
It just a lot of work
and I'd love your help.

24:13.219 --> 24:14.654
Looks great.

24:17.890 --> 24:20.627
Come back here, check it out.

24:27.199 --> 24:32.038
Were you ever, like,
a professional actor?

24:32.071 --> 24:34.006
No, no.

24:36.008 --> 24:40.847
I did plays in school.
And then I did...

24:40.880 --> 24:44.050
"Romeo and Juliet"
at Bucks County.

24:44.083 --> 24:46.853
That was fun.

24:46.886 --> 24:52.859
And then I just...
I just stopped, you know?

24:52.892 --> 24:56.896
I don't know.
Life just gets in the way.

24:56.929 --> 25:00.099
Well,
you shouldn't have stopped,

25:00.132 --> 25:02.535
because I bet you'd be
really famous right now.

25:02.569 --> 25:03.703
Yeah.

25:03.736 --> 25:04.971
But, I mean, I didn't,

25:05.004 --> 25:07.273
I wasn't nearly as good
as you are.

25:07.306 --> 25:08.708
I mean, when I was your age?

25:08.741 --> 25:12.979
Like... you're really good.

25:13.012 --> 25:15.114
-[chuckles]
-Seriously.

25:15.147 --> 25:16.716
You're really good.

25:18.785 --> 25:20.553
Alright, the lighting board.

25:20.587 --> 25:23.122
Okay, I'm ready to learn.

25:24.957 --> 25:27.860
[upbeat music]

26:34.827 --> 26:37.329
So does Eric still
have to work with Sybil?

26:37.363 --> 26:38.364
After that one day?

26:38.397 --> 26:40.099
Fuck if I know.

26:43.335 --> 26:45.271
I'm thinking of, like,
texting him something.

26:45.304 --> 26:46.806
But I don't know.

26:46.839 --> 26:48.374
-I have no idea what to say--
-Actually,

26:48.407 --> 26:50.910
I had a really good idea
of something funny we could do.

26:50.943 --> 26:52.378
[Coach] Let's go Bulldogs!
Come on, girls.

26:52.411 --> 26:54.814
[cheering]

26:54.847 --> 26:56.115
I'll tell ya after the game.

26:56.148 --> 26:58.751
You are one hot bitch!
Let's slaughter!

26:58.785 --> 27:01.120
[cheering]

27:58.811 --> 28:00.246
Yeah, send it.

28:19.966 --> 28:21.000
That Beatle guy?

28:21.033 --> 28:22.001
Yeah.

28:22.034 --> 28:23.269
That was very precise.

28:23.302 --> 28:26.272
[chatter]

28:38.250 --> 28:41.087
Um, hey, so,

28:41.120 --> 28:43.055
I feel like I owe you an apology

28:43.089 --> 28:45.357
for standing you up in class
the other day.

28:45.391 --> 28:47.159
It's okay.

28:47.193 --> 28:49.762
No, come on, I fucked up.

28:49.796 --> 28:55.501
I honestly was sick,
but I should've told you.

28:55.534 --> 28:58.470
And I was thinking, to, maybe,
just to make it up to you,

28:58.504 --> 28:59.839
like, we could, we could go to

28:59.872 --> 29:02.909
the auditorium
after school, practice?

29:04.343 --> 29:06.946
You want to practice
after school?

29:06.979 --> 29:10.950
Yeah, I mean, like,
all the other kids
are meeting up and, like,

29:10.983 --> 29:14.086
I just feel bad that we didn't
get a chance to perform.

29:17.256 --> 29:20.292
Dude, I'm trying--
can you not, right now?

29:21.393 --> 29:23.562
Dude, no, okay, I look, I know

29:23.595 --> 29:26.465
I was a dick to you, okay?
I'm sorry.

29:26.498 --> 29:28.500
But if I flunk this class,

29:28.534 --> 29:31.470
I'm gonna get kicked off
the team.

29:31.503 --> 29:33.372
So help a guy out?

29:43.082 --> 29:44.116
Okay.

29:45.384 --> 29:46.953
I'll be-- we'll be great.

29:46.986 --> 29:49.421
We're gonna break
people's hearts.

29:49.455 --> 29:51.157
Alright?

30:01.500 --> 30:06.005
I think it's just which scenes
best tell the story?

30:06.038 --> 30:09.508
Yeah, You know, look, we have
to start with Act 1, Scene 1.

30:09.541 --> 30:11.343
I want someone to read

30:11.377 --> 30:15.247
"Salem, Massachusetts in the
spring of the year 1692", but...

30:15.281 --> 30:16.582
-Can I see?
-Yeah,

30:16.615 --> 30:19.886
I'm just not sure
where to cut it.

30:23.655 --> 30:26.993
How's the scene
coming with Eric?

30:28.627 --> 30:33.499
He asked me to practice
in here after school.

30:34.466 --> 30:36.035
Really?

30:39.138 --> 30:40.973
Good for him. He needs it.

30:41.007 --> 30:44.210
He's got a lot of
catching up to do.

30:46.612 --> 30:50.482
You know, if you want,
we can just meet up after

30:50.516 --> 30:52.551
-and keep working on this.
-Yeah, sure.

30:52.584 --> 30:55.922
I mean, yeah,
that'd be really helpful.

30:55.955 --> 30:57.023
Great.

31:06.065 --> 31:07.633
Thanks for...

31:09.335 --> 31:11.904
for doing this, by the way.

31:12.504 --> 31:15.074
For doing what?

31:15.107 --> 31:18.477
Letting me help you out with
the showcase and everything.

31:18.510 --> 31:20.279
Thanks for helping me out.

31:20.312 --> 31:22.548
I didn't realize how much work
it was gonna be.

31:22.581 --> 31:24.316
-[laughs]
-It's a big play,

31:24.350 --> 31:27.053
I just, we'll figure it out.

31:30.957 --> 31:35.527
It's just nice to...

31:35.561 --> 31:38.130
I don't know.
To get to come in here,

31:38.164 --> 31:41.467
and have someone to talk to.

31:43.669 --> 31:46.605
There's not really anyone else
that I'm close to.

31:48.540 --> 31:51.210
Yeah, I know what you mean.

31:53.379 --> 31:56.615
I don't have anyone that
I'm really close to either.

31:59.118 --> 32:01.920
[bell rings]

32:04.556 --> 32:05.657
I'll see you after school?

32:05.691 --> 32:08.094
-Yeah.
-Okay.

32:08.127 --> 32:10.362
Thanks for the help.

32:39.125 --> 32:40.159
Thanks.

32:43.695 --> 32:46.065
Oh my goodness.

32:46.698 --> 32:49.135
Seriously!

32:49.168 --> 32:50.736
Ready to laugh
your fucking ass off?

32:50.769 --> 32:52.204
Yeah.

32:52.238 --> 32:53.405
I'll catch up with you later.

32:53.439 --> 32:55.407
-Later?
-She's not coming?

32:55.441 --> 32:57.343
Coming to what?

32:57.376 --> 33:00.446
Nothing. Don't worry about it.

33:00.479 --> 33:02.414
Is this about Abigail again?

33:02.448 --> 33:03.682
No.

33:05.551 --> 33:08.287
Look, I told you guys,
I don't wanna do anything--

33:08.320 --> 33:10.322
Do you have a crush on her
or something?

33:10.356 --> 33:11.490
What?

33:11.523 --> 33:14.260
Not judging, just curious.

33:17.529 --> 33:20.099
I think you guys
would make a cute couple.

33:20.132 --> 33:21.667
[chuckles]

33:23.302 --> 33:24.336
Come on.

33:26.105 --> 33:27.273
I'm done.

33:28.840 --> 33:30.342
Oops.

33:30.376 --> 33:32.244
Come on, let's go.

34:21.226 --> 34:24.330
It were a fire
you walked me through,

34:24.362 --> 34:26.398
and all my ignorance
was burned away.

34:28.234 --> 34:32.438
It were a fire, John,
we lay in fire.

34:32.471 --> 34:34.540
And from that moment no woman
dare call me wicked any--

34:34.572 --> 34:36.675
-[clatter]
-Oh shit!

35:06.838 --> 35:09.575
[thunder rumbling]

35:30.462 --> 35:32.531
[pouring rain]

35:35.967 --> 35:37.769
You want me to give you a ride?

35:44.276 --> 35:45.777
[sighs] Whooo.

35:48.480 --> 35:49.748
Here.

35:49.781 --> 35:51.417
Here, take this.

35:52.918 --> 35:54.853
-Thanks.
-Yeah,

35:54.886 --> 35:57.656
no problem.
Warm you up.

36:01.693 --> 36:03.195
Where do you live?

36:03.229 --> 36:04.463
Over by the library?

36:04.496 --> 36:06.565
-Oh, great.
-That's right by me.

36:06.598 --> 36:09.301
We're practically neighbors.

36:18.544 --> 36:19.945
You know what?

36:19.978 --> 36:22.248
I'm gonna talk to Eric tomorrow.

36:22.281 --> 36:24.416
It's bullshit.

36:27.953 --> 36:30.188
It wasn't just him.

36:31.957 --> 36:33.592
While I was waiting
in the auditorium,

36:33.625 --> 36:35.694
I decided to run
through my monologue.

36:38.364 --> 36:42.234
And I heard a girl
laughing in the wings.

36:49.475 --> 36:51.943
[sighs] You know what?
Fuck them.

36:51.977 --> 36:53.279
Okay?

36:54.513 --> 36:57.616
I'll do the scene with you.

36:57.649 --> 36:59.385
-Really?
-Yeah.

36:59.418 --> 37:02.354
I'll do the scene with you
for the showcase.

37:03.021 --> 37:04.490
Thanks.

37:13.332 --> 37:14.800
Is anyone home?

37:17.002 --> 37:18.670
Not 'til late.

37:22.308 --> 37:24.343
Is it okay if
I just sit here for a bit?

37:26.445 --> 37:27.613
Sure.

37:38.457 --> 37:41.660
You want me
to turn on the radio?

37:45.731 --> 37:48.667
[slow music playing]

37:53.739 --> 37:59.044
* Oh, I remember,
just you and me

38:02.948 --> 38:09.721
* Timeless nights, endless seas

38:12.023 --> 38:16.795
* Nothing was spoken of,

38:16.828 --> 38:20.799
* But truth and dreams, love

38:20.832 --> 38:23.335
* Let us not break

38:23.369 --> 38:27.573
* Let us not fade away

38:28.740 --> 38:31.943
* So hold that thought

38:31.977 --> 38:35.581
* We must find a way

38:37.082 --> 38:40.986
* 'Cause it's a sure crash

38:41.019 --> 38:44.990
* If we go down this road

38:53.999 --> 38:55.901
Where have you been?

38:55.934 --> 38:57.836
I've been calling you.

38:57.869 --> 38:59.538
You scared the shit out of me.

38:59.571 --> 39:02.741
You were supposed to
meet Michael about the job.

39:03.542 --> 39:07.546
Oh... shit.

39:07.579 --> 39:09.481
That was today? Fuck.

39:09.515 --> 39:11.550
-Yeah.
-Fuck.

39:11.583 --> 39:15.721
-That was today.
-I just got caught up at school.

39:15.754 --> 39:17.088
You know what?

39:17.122 --> 39:20.759
Let me just change out
of the wet clothes,

39:20.792 --> 39:21.960
-I'll be two seconds.
-I already canceled.

39:21.993 --> 39:23.862
It's fucked, okay?

39:24.596 --> 39:25.664
Okay.

39:29.501 --> 39:30.902
It's not a big deal,
Jen, I'll just--

39:30.936 --> 39:33.071
I don't know
what's going on with you.

39:35.040 --> 39:37.809
Do you think you're blowing this
a little out of proportion?

39:37.843 --> 39:38.810
[sighs]

39:40.546 --> 39:42.948
Look, I have been
trying to help you.

39:42.981 --> 39:44.783
I have been patient with you.

39:44.816 --> 39:46.852
I have been so fucking
patient with you.

39:46.885 --> 39:48.887
I have been supportive
of all of your shit.

39:48.920 --> 39:50.722
This is really unfair to me.

39:50.756 --> 39:53.191
What, you're mad
because I'm teaching?

39:53.224 --> 39:54.526
-Is that was this?
-No, this isn't.

39:54.560 --> 39:56.394
You're just, it's...

39:57.929 --> 40:00.566
you don't know what you want.

40:00.599 --> 40:02.768
You quit one job,
I'm supportive of that.

40:02.801 --> 40:04.503
You take time off
to figure out what you want.

40:04.536 --> 40:05.804
Don't be passive aggressive
to me.

40:05.837 --> 40:07.138
That's, that's passive aggres--

40:07.172 --> 40:09.941
Look, you either
want this or you don't.

40:09.975 --> 40:11.943
See, this is the problem.

40:11.977 --> 40:14.680
This, this is...

40:14.713 --> 40:15.914
I don't want
to get into this with you, okay?

40:15.947 --> 40:17.583
I'm sorry I was late, I--

40:17.616 --> 40:20.018
I'm just gonna let you
figure this out, okay?

40:20.819 --> 40:22.187
Alright?

41:07.098 --> 41:08.900
To Abigail.

41:08.934 --> 41:11.703
[laughs] To Abigail.

41:17.108 --> 41:19.077
Whooo. [coughs]

41:20.145 --> 41:22.848
Oh, to dear Abigail!

41:28.754 --> 41:30.656
[giggles]

41:39.665 --> 41:41.099
-[chatter]
-Hey, guys.

41:41.132 --> 41:43.034
Hold on.
Hold the work for a second.

41:43.068 --> 41:46.805
I have a couple changes
to make in the groups.

41:46.838 --> 41:49.240
Eric, I'm gonna
move you to Group Four.

41:49.274 --> 41:51.076
Oh, hey.

41:51.109 --> 41:53.612
So does that mean
I get to work with Abby?

41:53.645 --> 41:55.046
No, I am.

41:56.648 --> 41:58.016
[boy] You okay, now?

41:58.049 --> 41:59.618
You're gonna,
you can be my understudy.

41:59.651 --> 42:01.219
[Eric] Thanks, man.

42:01.252 --> 42:05.323
[Jeremy] Okay, and then,
I think what I wanna do here,

42:05.356 --> 42:08.927
is I should cross into here,

42:08.960 --> 42:11.563
and I hold the lantern
to your face.

42:11.597 --> 42:13.699
I'm gonna hold it really close
to your face!

42:13.732 --> 42:16.668
But this is gonna
be the only light at this point,

42:16.702 --> 42:19.204
this is the first time the
audience really sees your face.

42:19.237 --> 42:20.906
You don't--
you don't like this?

42:20.939 --> 42:22.608
Okay, and that's why I say,
"Can you see my face?"

42:22.641 --> 42:24.009
-Yeah, that's why,
-[laughs]

42:24.042 --> 42:25.310
-We'll ask the audience,
-You gonna ask?

42:25.343 --> 42:27.245
-"Can you see my face?"
-Can you see her face?

42:27.278 --> 42:29.280
[Abigail laughs]

42:58.276 --> 42:59.611
Aight.

43:02.147 --> 43:03.782
Good.

43:03.815 --> 43:06.652
Yeah, yeah.

43:06.685 --> 43:08.820
[rap music playing]

43:10.288 --> 43:12.223
Dude. Puff, pass.

43:13.792 --> 43:15.727
Two puffs.

43:15.761 --> 43:18.263
Do I hear little girls?

43:18.296 --> 43:20.098
-Hey!
-[giggling]

43:20.131 --> 43:21.700
Hi, boys.

43:21.733 --> 43:23.334
Ooh, they brought
the party with them.

43:23.368 --> 43:26.071
Oh my goodness, what is this?

43:26.104 --> 43:27.405
-Hello.
-Hello.

43:27.438 --> 43:29.741
-Let's get fucked up!
-Yes, please.

43:29.775 --> 43:31.142
-Oh...
-I'm sorry.

43:31.176 --> 43:34.780
-Oh my god!
-Fuckin' careful!

43:34.813 --> 43:37.716
Hey, you can come
sit down, here.

43:37.749 --> 43:39.651
Take a, here's a beer.

43:39.685 --> 43:41.052
I got you this.

43:43.188 --> 43:45.423
Look at these fucking swords
you've got on your foot.

43:45.456 --> 43:48.159
-Here, give me that bottle.
-You're gonna drink it
from the bottle?

43:48.193 --> 43:50.195
-Yeah.
-Like a real man.

43:50.228 --> 43:52.698
Okay.

43:52.731 --> 43:56.702
Here's to...
these fucking uniforms, man!

43:56.735 --> 43:59.104
[laughter]

44:21.860 --> 44:24.796
Dude, do you have your phone?

44:24.830 --> 44:26.932
Ugh, it's upstairs, no!

44:36.908 --> 44:38.944
[rap music continues]

44:41.112 --> 44:42.881
Can you guys kiss?

44:42.914 --> 44:45.150
Oh, c'mon,
be good cheerleaders!

44:51.322 --> 44:52.991
Oh!

44:53.024 --> 44:54.760
Fuck you!

44:54.793 --> 44:56.762
-Don't do that!
-Try again.

44:56.795 --> 44:58.029
[Eric] We were so close.

44:58.063 --> 45:00.398
Ohhh, oh shit!

45:01.166 --> 45:02.734
Oh shit.

45:09.474 --> 45:13.011
These should be
the cheer uniforms.

45:39.504 --> 45:43.441
Guys, I'm so drunk.

45:43.474 --> 45:45.844
That's good.
That's the way we like you.

46:19.444 --> 46:20.478
C'mere.

46:22.848 --> 46:25.316
-[giggles]
-Oh, oh, oh, oh...

46:38.429 --> 46:40.498
Do you think I'm hot?

46:40.531 --> 46:44.069
I think you're the
hottest girl in school.

47:13.264 --> 47:16.067
Uh, do you,
do you have a condom?

47:16.101 --> 47:17.368
I can pull out.

47:17.402 --> 47:21.272
Uh, do you mind
just putting one on?

47:40.325 --> 47:43.061
Yeah, yeah, I want you.

47:54.039 --> 47:55.506
[retching]

47:55.540 --> 47:57.575
[coughing]

47:57.608 --> 47:59.677
No, no, don't,
don't worry about.

47:59.710 --> 48:01.312
Oh, fuck.

48:01.346 --> 48:02.613
Fuck.

48:02.647 --> 48:04.482
-[spits]
-Oh, gosh.

48:04.515 --> 48:06.584
-Oh, shh...
-I got it.

48:06.617 --> 48:07.652
I got it, I got it.

48:07.685 --> 48:09.020
Hey, it's okay.

48:09.054 --> 48:10.455
[retches, coughs]

48:12.657 --> 48:15.193
Okay, come on, honey.

48:15.226 --> 48:18.063
Get it out, okay?

48:20.365 --> 48:23.168
Oh, honey.

48:23.201 --> 48:26.104
Here, let's... come on.

48:26.137 --> 48:28.940
Can we, like, go to the
bathroom or something?

48:28.974 --> 48:30.208
Yeah, of course, of course.

48:30.241 --> 48:32.310
I'll get you
cleaned up, come on.

48:57.268 --> 48:58.236
Two coffees?

48:58.269 --> 49:00.405
It's not hard.

49:00.438 --> 49:02.340
If it hadn't taken her so long,
we definitely
would've been on time.

49:02.373 --> 49:03.741
Please!

49:03.774 --> 49:05.043
Nope.

49:06.311 --> 49:08.613
[speaker beeps]

49:08.646 --> 49:10.648
I can't fucking believe
it's Monday already.

49:10.681 --> 49:11.949
-[speaker beeps]
-I know.

49:15.453 --> 49:16.554
Hey!

49:21.692 --> 49:23.594
Oh, Sophie Grant.

49:23.628 --> 49:26.164
[door buzzes, opens]

49:26.197 --> 49:28.466
[chatter]

49:52.690 --> 49:54.392
Listen to this.

49:56.227 --> 49:59.464
[suspenseful music]

50:45.143 --> 50:46.577
-[chatter]
-Alright, guys.

50:46.611 --> 50:49.714
Just stop the work for a second.

50:49.747 --> 50:52.217
I picked the scenes
for the showcase.

50:52.250 --> 50:56.154
I think I picked the scenes
that best tell the story
of "The Crucible",

50:56.187 --> 50:58.123
as well as picking the scenes

50:58.156 --> 51:00.425
of the groups that
were most involved.

51:00.458 --> 51:03.828
If you don't hear
your name called, I don't
want you to stop working,

51:03.861 --> 51:06.364
'cause you will present on
Wednesday in front of the class.

51:06.397 --> 51:07.865
Okay?

51:07.898 --> 51:10.768
We're gonna start with excerpts
of Act 1, Scene 1,

51:10.801 --> 51:12.437
Sherilyn and Gina.

51:12.470 --> 51:16.874
And then we move to Act 2,
Scene 2, Abigail.

51:16.907 --> 51:19.377
And then Act 2, Scene 3,

51:19.410 --> 51:21.679
Lily, Phe, and Jack.

51:21.712 --> 51:23.548
So, I'm really
proud of you guys.

51:23.581 --> 51:25.383
-It was some great work.
-[knock on door]

51:25.416 --> 51:27.285
Hey, sorry to interrupt.
You got a sec, Jeremy?

51:27.318 --> 51:30.288
Yeah. You guys keep working,
I'll be right back.

51:35.826 --> 51:38.163
Hey, Abby.

51:38.196 --> 51:40.731
Think you can still act
with our teacher's dick
in your mouth?

51:40.765 --> 51:42.833
[boys laugh]

51:45.370 --> 51:47.405
Weren't you in Abby's
psych class last year?

51:47.438 --> 51:48.639
[Eric] Yeah.

51:48.673 --> 51:51.742
Yeah, what exactly happened?

51:51.776 --> 51:54.145
-I never heard the full story.
-Shut up.

51:58.549 --> 52:00.185
Oh...

52:02.587 --> 52:04.789
He doesn't know, does he?

52:06.291 --> 52:08.659
Wanna tell him together, Sybil?

52:14.965 --> 52:18.469
I said shut up.

52:18.503 --> 52:20.371
What the fuck, psycho bitch!

52:20.405 --> 52:21.839
Get away from me!

52:21.872 --> 52:23.608
-Hey, what's going on in here?
-Leave me alone!

52:23.641 --> 52:26.344
She, like, fucking attacked me!

52:26.377 --> 52:28.646
Okay, Melissa, grab your stuff
and head to guidance.

52:28.679 --> 52:30.515
-No, no, she came--
-What?

52:30.548 --> 52:32.783
-Go to guidance.
-She didn't even do anything!

52:32.817 --> 52:34.285
-[Eric] She came at her!
-It was completely Abby!

52:34.319 --> 52:35.686
[Melissa]
Are you shitting me Jeremy?

52:35.720 --> 52:37.322
-Hey! Don't talk to me that way.
-You know what?

52:37.355 --> 52:38.923
Don't fucking tell me
how to talk to you!

52:48.899 --> 52:50.568
You alright?

52:53.571 --> 52:55.340
I'm sorry.

52:55.373 --> 52:56.607
-C'mon. Let's go outside.
-[Abigail whimpers]

52:56.641 --> 52:58.409
Let's go outside and talk.

53:08.253 --> 53:10.321
[Abigail] It were a fire
you walked me through.

53:10.355 --> 53:13.258
And all my ignorance
was burned away.

53:14.692 --> 53:16.327
It were a fire, John.

53:17.428 --> 53:21.299
We lay in fire.

53:21.332 --> 53:23.801
And from that moment no woman
dare call me wicked anymore

53:23.834 --> 53:25.836
but I knew my answer.

53:28.373 --> 53:30.808
I used to weep for my sins

53:30.841 --> 53:34.479
when the wind
lifted up my skirts,

53:34.512 --> 53:37.915
and blushed for shame
because some old Rebecca
called me loose.

53:40.485 --> 53:41.952
And you,

53:46.624 --> 53:48.993
you burned my ignorance away.

54:05.042 --> 54:07.512
-[door shuts]
-[gasps]

54:25.663 --> 54:27.031
Hey.

54:28.633 --> 54:30.701
I've been looking
all over for you.

54:32.470 --> 54:34.705
You haven't been at lunch.

54:34.739 --> 54:38.443
Yeah, I didn't realize
I was welcome.

54:39.910 --> 54:42.447
Do you maybe wanna study
for the chem test later?

54:42.480 --> 54:44.682
What?

54:44.715 --> 54:46.684
I know, I'm sorry.
I know you're really mad at me.

54:46.717 --> 54:49.887
I just, I really have to
talk to you about something.

54:49.920 --> 54:50.988
What?

54:52.390 --> 54:54.359
There's no one here.

54:56.561 --> 54:57.728
What?

54:59.430 --> 55:01.599
I had sex with Eric.

55:05.603 --> 55:06.837
Congrats?

55:06.871 --> 55:08.339
Yeah.

55:10.941 --> 55:12.009
How was it?

55:12.042 --> 55:14.044
Good, it was good.

55:17.014 --> 55:18.683
What happened?

55:21.151 --> 55:23.721
He's been ignoring me.

55:23.754 --> 55:25.656
He won't even look at me
since Monday,

55:25.690 --> 55:30.060
and um, so I finally texted him
today and I saw that he read it,

55:30.094 --> 55:33.030
but, yeah,
he hasn't texted me back.

55:35.933 --> 55:38.636
Ah, I just don't understand.

55:43.408 --> 55:45.943
Can I come to your house
later tonight?

55:48.713 --> 55:50.681
Yeah, sure.

55:52.116 --> 55:56.120
-[rap music]
-[Robert shouting, indistinct]

56:16.040 --> 56:17.141
Hey.

56:21.679 --> 56:27.718
Um, I'd love to talk to you,

56:27.752 --> 56:31.922
if you have some time.

56:31.956 --> 56:33.924
You think you could come over?

56:33.958 --> 56:35.693
[knock on door]

56:38.162 --> 56:39.964
[door opens]

56:50.608 --> 56:52.443
-Hey.
-Hey.

56:57.114 --> 56:58.849
I wanna do this.

57:02.252 --> 57:03.821
With you.

58:07.184 --> 58:08.218
I can't.

58:14.892 --> 58:15.926
Please.

59:05.275 --> 59:06.243
I can't.

59:06.276 --> 59:08.178
Shhh.

59:09.714 --> 59:11.682
-Come here.
-I can't.

59:11.716 --> 59:13.083
Come here.

59:49.086 --> 59:51.722
[panting]

59:56.293 --> 59:58.629
Okay, it's still very hot,

59:58.663 --> 01:00:01.265
-but a cocoa, your favorite.
-Oh...

01:00:01.298 --> 01:00:04.268
Thank you.

01:00:04.301 --> 01:00:07.037
So, um, I think we're
pretty much done, we just--

01:00:07.071 --> 01:00:08.906
Hey, El?

01:00:08.939 --> 01:00:11.909
I'm really sorry that
I've been such a bitch lately.

01:00:16.046 --> 01:00:20.985
Um, could you just
find the next... the next topic?

01:00:21.018 --> 01:00:22.820
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

01:01:04.995 --> 01:01:07.064
Hey, what's up?

01:01:07.097 --> 01:01:09.967
Oh my god, Melissa,
you are not
going to believe this!

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.068
What?

01:01:13.403 --> 01:01:14.839
Hola, hola!

01:01:16.373 --> 01:01:18.442
Alright, so,

01:01:18.475 --> 01:01:21.178
did you find that last page
about buffer zones?

01:01:21.211 --> 01:01:23.180
Couldn't find it.

01:01:25.049 --> 01:01:26.817
What?

01:01:26.851 --> 01:01:29.186
Nothing. I'm just super
stressed out about this test.

01:01:29.219 --> 01:01:31.722
Oh, yeah. Tell me about it.

01:01:33.758 --> 01:01:35.926
Fuck! Fuck!

01:01:52.176 --> 01:01:55.479
Alright, so, I think we cross,

01:01:55.512 --> 01:01:58.382
cross stage left here.

01:01:58.415 --> 01:02:00.217
Oh, I'm crossing there?

01:02:00.250 --> 01:02:03.954
Yeah, I think, I think that
will be right for the moment.

01:02:03.988 --> 01:02:06.190
-Right after that.
-Mmm-hmm.

01:02:06.223 --> 01:02:09.293
Should we go over that
after school today?

01:02:10.995 --> 01:02:12.496
Ah, no, no.

01:02:13.998 --> 01:02:16.066
I got a lot of stuff
going on today.

01:02:17.234 --> 01:02:21.105
Swamped, you know at, at home.

01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:26.110
-You want help?
-Oh, no, thank you.

01:02:26.143 --> 01:02:28.012
That's very nice of you,
Abigail.

01:02:28.045 --> 01:02:30.514
Uh, but, I'm, I'm fine.

01:02:30.547 --> 01:02:33.017
I got it covered.

01:02:33.050 --> 01:02:35.485
You think Kennelly's
throwing a quiz?

01:02:41.291 --> 01:02:42.893
Okay.

01:02:57.007 --> 01:03:00.544
[bell rings]

01:03:03.914 --> 01:03:06.583
-Hey.
-I altered my costume.

01:03:06.616 --> 01:03:09.453
Figured I could try it on
when we rehearsed today.

01:03:09.486 --> 01:03:14.925
Uh, I, I can't today, Abigail,
I'm really swamped at home.

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:33.543
[voicemail] Hey, you've reached
Jeremy Woods, leave a message.

01:03:41.886 --> 01:03:44.121
[soft music]

01:04:18.322 --> 01:04:22.960
* Said it felt like
a storm coming

01:04:25.629 --> 01:04:27.597
* You got to help me

01:04:27.631 --> 01:04:31.435
* You gotta hold me now

01:04:36.273 --> 01:04:40.945
* Took all my strength
not to eat you alive

01:04:42.579 --> 01:04:45.115
* Cause I'm evil enough

01:04:45.149 --> 01:04:47.584
* For the both of us

01:04:47.617 --> 01:04:50.354
* Call me the liar

01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:06.103
[voicemail] Hey,
you've reached Jeremy Woods.

01:05:25.489 --> 01:05:28.225
So, homecoming's tomorrow.

01:05:30.394 --> 01:05:32.929
I guess I'm not going with Eric.

01:05:34.331 --> 01:05:36.233
[Melissa] That sucks, babe.

01:05:49.246 --> 01:05:51.481
Hey, how's it going?

01:05:51.515 --> 01:05:56.020
So I was wondering
what time we were
getting together tonight?

01:05:57.254 --> 01:05:58.622
To get ready for homecoming?

01:06:00.724 --> 01:06:02.559
Yeah, of course
I still wanna go!

01:06:02.592 --> 01:06:05.395
I thought you were
gonna be my date?

01:06:08.532 --> 01:06:10.100
No, she's just
gonna meet us there.

01:06:12.169 --> 01:06:13.703
So I'll just, like,
bring my makeup

01:06:13.737 --> 01:06:16.573
and my stuff over to your house
at, like, sixish?

01:06:16.606 --> 01:06:18.675
Okay, um, awesome!

01:06:18.708 --> 01:06:20.110
I'll see you then.

01:06:20.144 --> 01:06:22.279
I'm excited!

01:06:22.312 --> 01:06:24.048
Okay, bye, Ellie!

01:06:26.283 --> 01:06:27.617
Sophie!

01:06:27.651 --> 01:06:30.387
Just a second!
I need to find my necklace!

01:06:49.206 --> 01:06:50.174
Sophie!

01:06:50.207 --> 01:06:51.608
Yeah, coming!

01:06:52.609 --> 01:06:55.279
[whispers] Fuck.

01:06:55.312 --> 01:06:56.280
[pop music playing]

01:06:56.313 --> 01:06:57.681
Alright.

01:06:57.714 --> 01:06:59.516
I feel like if we have
a positive attitude,

01:06:59.549 --> 01:07:01.418
this could be a lot of fun.

01:07:01.451 --> 01:07:02.786
-Hi.
-Hi.

01:07:02.819 --> 01:07:05.122
-Yes, here we are.
-Yes, of course.

01:07:05.155 --> 01:07:07.191
-Thank you.
-Thank you!

01:07:07.224 --> 01:07:09.559
Have a good night.

01:07:09.593 --> 01:07:12.262
-[gasps] The sign looks so good.
-Who drew this?

01:07:12.296 --> 01:07:14.231
Before you say
anything I did, okay.

01:07:14.264 --> 01:07:17.467
-No! Oh, I'm so--
-Does this one look like
an acc-- oh.

01:07:17.501 --> 01:07:21.571
Oh, it was going so well.
Okay.

01:07:21.605 --> 01:07:24.641
-Did you get my text?
-No.

01:07:24.674 --> 01:07:26.710
Ugh, shit. Okay.
Did you get the paper?

01:07:26.743 --> 01:07:29.579
The one we talked about?
Did you get the paper or not?

01:07:29.613 --> 01:07:31.081
Sophie?!

01:07:31.115 --> 01:07:32.649
-No.
-What?

01:07:32.682 --> 01:07:34.518
I checked in her notebook,
but she tore it out.

01:07:34.551 --> 01:07:36.153
What? Fuck!

01:07:36.186 --> 01:07:37.621
Shit. We have to get that.
We have to get that!

01:07:37.654 --> 01:07:39.423
-You have to talk to her.
-[Eric] Hey. Hey-yo!

01:07:39.456 --> 01:07:42.192
Oh my god, hi!

01:07:42.226 --> 01:07:44.261
-How're you?
-Good.

01:07:44.294 --> 01:07:45.562
-Yeah, you look good.
-Hey.

01:07:45.595 --> 01:07:47.431
Hey, how's it going?

01:07:49.766 --> 01:07:51.201
-What do you wanna do?
-Around back?

01:07:51.235 --> 01:07:52.202
-Do you have?
-Yeah, I brought some.

01:07:52.236 --> 01:07:54.171
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

01:07:54.204 --> 01:07:56.173
-'Round back?
-Yeah, I'm just gonna
grab Ellie.

01:07:56.206 --> 01:07:57.774
Yeah, good.

01:07:57.807 --> 01:08:02.446
-Do we have to wait for her?
-Yeah.

01:08:02.479 --> 01:08:05.549
Sorry, um, we're just gonna go
around back if you wanna come?

01:08:05.582 --> 01:08:07.651
[sighs] Yeah?

01:08:07.684 --> 01:08:13.423
-Yeah, Melissa's just in a mood.
-Mm.

01:08:13.457 --> 01:08:15.859
Never happens. Alright, alright.

01:08:18.462 --> 01:08:21.398
Makes it easier to drink!
You do it, too!

01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:22.765
I know what I'm talking about!

01:08:22.799 --> 01:08:24.568
Maybe you--
What are you talking about?

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:27.804
-You're full of shit!
-[chatter]

01:08:27.837 --> 01:08:29.573
I'm good, thanks.

01:08:45.689 --> 01:08:50.627
Um, I actually wanted to
talk to you about something.

01:08:50.660 --> 01:08:51.627
-Are you done? Are you done?
-Yes, yes.

01:08:51.661 --> 01:08:53.796
[Ellie] Now?

01:08:53.830 --> 01:08:57.401
Um, I just feel, like,
really bad about what's been
going on with us.

01:08:57.434 --> 01:09:00.337
I know I've been a really
shitty friend to you lately.

01:09:00.370 --> 01:09:02.538
Thanks I just,
um, can we wait?

01:09:02.572 --> 01:09:04.640
Oh my god!
Put me down!

01:09:04.674 --> 01:09:06.810
-Put me down! Stop.
-Ask nicely.

01:09:06.843 --> 01:09:08.912
Stop.

01:09:08.944 --> 01:09:12.316
I just wanna say that I'm trying
to do the right thing here,

01:09:12.349 --> 01:09:14.451
-like, morally.
-Look what you did to my dress!

01:09:14.484 --> 01:09:16.520
Look, I read your diary
the other night,

01:09:16.553 --> 01:09:19.622
and I know what you saw,
and I think we should
report it to the school.

01:09:21.591 --> 01:09:22.892
-What?
-I know.

01:09:22.926 --> 01:09:25.261
-I'm sorry, but--
-No, God!

01:09:25.295 --> 01:09:27.197
I knew you were looking! Sophie.

01:09:27.231 --> 01:09:28.332
I know, but look, look, look.
He's taking advantage of her

01:09:28.365 --> 01:09:29.765
and we need to tell someone!

01:09:29.799 --> 01:09:31.468
Oh, please don't pretend
you actually care, okay?

01:09:31.501 --> 01:09:32.902
Melissa's obviously
putting you up to this.

01:09:32.935 --> 01:09:35.339
This isn't even about her!

01:09:35.372 --> 01:09:37.774
Sophie, do you not realize
she's literally
right behind you, like,

01:09:37.807 --> 01:09:40.410
on top of the guy
that you've been scheming
for like three years.

01:09:40.444 --> 01:09:43.412
Oh my god, Ellie!
This isn't even about her!

01:09:44.881 --> 01:09:47.350
Whatever, Sophie.
You do whatever you want.

01:09:47.384 --> 01:09:49.252
Like, at least she's not
obsessed with some pedophile

01:09:49.286 --> 01:09:50.886
-and his freaking--
-Oh my god!

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:52.622
Do you really not see
that she's just jealous?

01:09:52.656 --> 01:09:56.493
How 'bout you shut
the fuck up, dyke?

01:10:05.735 --> 01:10:06.803
Okay.

01:10:14.878 --> 01:10:16.546
Fuck that cunt.

01:10:25.889 --> 01:10:28.358
[rock music playing]

01:10:42.472 --> 01:10:44.474
-[knock on door]
-Shit.

01:10:44.508 --> 01:10:47.010
-What're you doing?
-Nothing.

01:10:47.043 --> 01:10:48.678
-Get out! Get out!
-What is this?

01:10:48.712 --> 01:10:50.447
-Get out!
-What're you doing with that?

01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:52.849
Get out of my room!
It's mine! Give it back!

01:10:52.882 --> 01:10:55.285
Give me the computer!

01:10:55.319 --> 01:10:56.553
What is this?
What are you doing?

01:10:56.586 --> 01:10:58.655
-Shit! Fuck!
-Hey!

01:10:58.688 --> 01:11:01.291
Don't you walk out on me!

01:11:22.679 --> 01:11:24.814
-[Eric] Jesus.
-Oh my goodness.

01:11:24.848 --> 01:11:27.517
-Mm, can I keep this?
-[Eric] Yup.

01:11:27.551 --> 01:11:32.656
What the fuck?
Oh, Jesus, Mel.

01:11:32.689 --> 01:11:35.325
-Slow down, slow down!
-Do you-- Next one.

01:11:35.359 --> 01:11:37.527
-Not bad.
-[Melissa] Okay, fuck off.

01:11:37.561 --> 01:11:38.795
They're not actually for you.

01:11:38.828 --> 01:11:40.597
-Please.
-[Eric] Who're they for?

01:11:40.630 --> 01:11:41.831
[Melissa] Stop, god.

01:11:41.865 --> 01:11:43.500
Mel, I need to
make a phone call.

01:11:43.533 --> 01:11:44.834
Mel, I need to use your phone.

01:11:44.868 --> 01:11:47.471
[laughter]

01:11:47.504 --> 01:11:49.373
Melissa, I have
to use your phone. Can I?

01:11:49.406 --> 01:11:53.610
-No, no, oh my god!
-[Jeremy] Melissa.

01:11:53.643 --> 01:11:56.380
Enough with the phone.
Bring it up here.

01:12:04.421 --> 01:12:05.622
Gimme it.

01:12:17.434 --> 01:12:18.802
Sit down, please.

01:12:30.980 --> 01:12:32.081
Jeremy!

01:12:33.717 --> 01:12:36.686
Hey, sorry I didn't
get back to you.

01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:39.022
Listen, I need to
ask you something.

01:12:40.490 --> 01:12:42.459
My necklace is gone.

01:12:42.492 --> 01:12:44.394
My cross?

01:12:46.630 --> 01:12:49.666
I think maybe
it came off in your car?

01:12:49.699 --> 01:12:52.602
I don't think so.

01:12:52.636 --> 01:12:58.041
So I was thinking
maybe later I could...
come by and look for it?

01:12:59.743 --> 01:13:05.081
Um, well...

01:13:05.114 --> 01:13:07.150
today's really not a good day.

01:13:09.218 --> 01:13:11.821
I'll walk home.

01:13:11.855 --> 01:13:13.590
You can pick me up tonight.

01:13:15.592 --> 01:13:18.428
Can we talk about this tomorrow?

01:13:18.462 --> 01:13:20.630
You don't wanna see me?

01:13:22.098 --> 01:13:24.534
I just, I have a
lot going on, and, uh,

01:13:24.568 --> 01:13:27.103
let's talk about this tomorrow.

01:13:30.474 --> 01:13:32.175
[car engine starts]

01:13:53.162 --> 01:13:56.032
[voicemail]
Hey, you've reached
Jeremy Woods.

01:14:22.759 --> 01:14:24.994
What's going on guys?
What're you working on?

01:14:25.028 --> 01:14:26.763
We're trying to figure out what
we're going to be wearing?

01:14:26.796 --> 01:14:28.197
Yeah, when do we
rehearse in costume?

01:14:28.231 --> 01:14:29.766
That's a great question.

01:14:29.799 --> 01:14:31.835
When are we gonna
rehearse in costumes?

01:14:31.868 --> 01:14:36.840
Are you guys starting to think
about costumes and wardrobe?

01:14:36.873 --> 01:14:40.043
Here's the name of that book
you were asking me about.

01:14:46.149 --> 01:14:47.951
I want you guys to design it.

01:14:47.984 --> 01:14:49.653
I want you
to look at the tape

01:14:49.686 --> 01:14:51.721
and bring it in so we can
show these guys, okay?

01:14:51.755 --> 01:14:54.490
-Yeah. Yeah, thanks.
-Good, good.

01:15:05.334 --> 01:15:06.636
Ugh.

01:15:07.236 --> 01:15:08.271
Thanks.

01:15:44.608 --> 01:15:47.644
[footsteps approach]

01:15:49.312 --> 01:15:51.214
Hey.

01:15:51.247 --> 01:15:52.649
What's going on?

01:15:52.682 --> 01:15:54.083
Can we talk?

01:15:54.117 --> 01:15:56.586
I have a meeting
in here in a minute.

01:15:56.620 --> 01:15:58.588
It's not a good time.

01:16:02.358 --> 01:16:05.094
With Abigail?

01:16:05.128 --> 01:16:07.831
What do you wanna
talk about, Melissa?

01:16:10.399 --> 01:16:12.969
[whistles]

01:16:13.002 --> 01:16:14.904
Abigail, slow up.

01:16:16.172 --> 01:16:17.941
What's the rush, Abigail?

01:16:17.974 --> 01:16:19.876
C'mon, c'mon,
c'mon, c'mon, c'mon.

01:16:19.909 --> 01:16:23.847
Hey, there's something
Eric really wants to ask you.

01:16:38.194 --> 01:16:40.630
Wait, please, I...

01:16:40.664 --> 01:16:43.099
I really need somebody
to talk to right now.

01:16:50.373 --> 01:16:52.341
We were wondering if,
if you just,

01:16:52.375 --> 01:16:55.745
if you ever wanted to
chill with us, like,
we got a basement.

01:16:55.779 --> 01:16:58.614
And beer and stuff.

01:16:59.783 --> 01:17:01.818
I guess you haven't heard.

01:17:01.851 --> 01:17:03.753
I'm not really into little boys.

01:17:05.221 --> 01:17:06.890
[laughing] Oh!

01:17:11.027 --> 01:17:12.161
What's going on?

01:17:14.197 --> 01:17:17.967
Why didn't you pick me
for that part?

01:17:18.001 --> 01:17:20.203
-Melissa--
-Why did you pick her?

01:17:21.437 --> 01:17:22.939
Why?

01:17:22.972 --> 01:17:26.175
You didn't know us.

01:17:26.209 --> 01:17:29.378
What?
Did you feel sorry for her?

01:17:30.379 --> 01:17:31.681
No.

01:17:38.287 --> 01:17:40.924
I just wanted you to notice me.

01:17:46.863 --> 01:17:49.032
-[gasps]
-Stop!

01:19:04.340 --> 01:19:05.809
Where did you get that?

01:19:06.910 --> 01:19:08.077
What?

01:19:08.111 --> 01:19:09.879
Where did you get that?

01:19:09.913 --> 01:19:11.080
-I don't know
what your talking--
-This is mine!

01:19:11.114 --> 01:19:13.316
Hey, get the fuck off me!

01:19:13.349 --> 01:19:15.184
What're you doing?

01:19:15.218 --> 01:19:18.421
[chuckles] Oh, with Jeremy?

01:19:20.356 --> 01:19:23.793
God, he is a great kisser,
don't you think?

01:19:26.162 --> 01:19:28.397
-You fucking whore!
-[yells]

01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:45.348
What was that?

01:19:50.954 --> 01:19:53.122
Help me go over my lines.

01:19:54.590 --> 01:19:59.362
Okay... come on.

01:20:04.968 --> 01:20:07.336
[chatter]

01:20:17.646 --> 01:20:21.550
It were a fire, John.
We lay in fire.

01:20:27.423 --> 01:20:29.025

-Have you seen Abigail?

01:20:29.058 --> 01:20:30.960
Uh, no.

01:20:30.994 --> 01:20:32.195
She's not backstage?

01:20:32.228 --> 01:20:33.462
I haven't seen her, no.

01:20:35.531 --> 01:20:36.933
Hey, you guys have seen Abigail?

01:20:36.966 --> 01:20:37.934
Anybody?

01:20:37.967 --> 01:20:40.403
-No.
-Sorry.

01:20:40.436 --> 01:20:43.907
Well, it looks like
the understudy's saving the day.

01:20:43.940 --> 01:20:45.574
[door squeaking]

01:20:59.522 --> 01:21:02.892
[boy] Only this consider,

01:21:02.926 --> 01:21:06.162
the world goes mad,
and it profit nothing

01:21:06.195 --> 01:21:10.166
you should lay the cause to
the vengeance of a little girl.

01:21:10.199 --> 01:21:12.601
[audience applause]

01:21:25.982 --> 01:21:28.584
Okay, this is you.

01:21:28.617 --> 01:21:30.586
Blackout for Scene 3.

01:21:32.288 --> 01:21:34.123
Hey, hey!

01:21:42.365 --> 01:21:46.069
[classical music plays]

01:21:52.741 --> 01:21:55.911
I must speak with you, Abigail.

01:22:07.390 --> 01:22:09.492
Will you sit?

01:22:09.525 --> 01:22:11.627
[Abigail] How do you come?

01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:13.062
[Jeremy] Friendly.

01:22:24.540 --> 01:22:25.975
[Abigail] You were no hypocrite!

01:22:26.009 --> 01:22:27.977
I will prove you
for the fraud you are!

01:22:28.011 --> 01:22:31.447
Oh, and if they ask you
why Abigail would ever
do so murderous a deed,

01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:33.249
what will you tell them?

01:22:35.318 --> 01:22:37.220
I will tell them why.

01:22:43.392 --> 01:22:44.994
[audience applause]

01:22:47.496 --> 01:22:48.631
Abigail.

01:22:49.565 --> 01:22:50.699
Abigail!

01:22:53.069 --> 01:22:54.770
Okay, so she gives
birth to a huge baby,

01:22:54.803 --> 01:22:57.440
which is bad enough and then
she comes home and--

01:22:57.473 --> 01:22:59.008
-Ms. Cohen?
-Yeah?

01:23:00.276 --> 01:23:02.145
I need to report an incident.

01:23:04.247 --> 01:23:07.083
Abigail! Abigail!
What's going on?

01:23:07.116 --> 01:23:09.252
What is going on with you?!

01:23:09.285 --> 01:23:11.154
You're not looking at me.
You're not talking to me.

01:23:11.187 --> 01:23:13.456
-You're ignoring my calls.
-Listen, listen to me, no, no,

01:23:13.489 --> 01:23:15.024
No, no!
What is going on with Melissa?

01:23:15.058 --> 01:23:16.359
Nothing's going--

01:23:17.660 --> 01:23:19.428
We, we can't do this right here.

01:23:19.462 --> 01:23:23.166
-Please don't--
-Why... why did you kiss me...

01:23:24.533 --> 01:23:26.702
if you don't wanna be with me?

[sobbing]

01:23:31.640 --> 01:23:34.377
I just, I just wanna know.

01:23:37.580 --> 01:23:39.315
I just wanna...

01:23:39.348 --> 01:23:41.050
-Okay, okay, shhh, shhh.
-I can't do this anymore.

01:23:41.084 --> 01:23:43.586
Look at me.
Look at me, and just calm--

01:23:43.619 --> 01:23:45.588
take a deep breath.

01:23:45.621 --> 01:23:48.157
Just, can I talk to you, hey.

01:23:48.191 --> 01:23:51.026
Let me just talk to you
in the car, okay?

01:24:03.406 --> 01:24:05.508
[engine revs]

01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:20.323
Look, I'm really sorry.

01:25:02.298 --> 01:25:04.533
I have something to give you.

01:25:14.743 --> 01:25:16.712
[Ms. Cohen] How're you feeling?

01:25:16.745 --> 01:25:17.813
Fine.

01:25:21.750 --> 01:25:23.586
Do I just start talking?

01:25:23.619 --> 01:25:26.722
Uh, Officer Dolan is just gonna
ask you some questions.

01:25:26.755 --> 01:25:28.524
As soon as you're ready.

01:25:28.557 --> 01:25:32.295
-I'm ready.
-Okay. Go ahead.

01:25:32.328 --> 01:25:34.930
Miss Bowman, did your
substitute drama teacher,

01:25:34.963 --> 01:25:40.469
Jeremy Woods, engage in
a sexual relationship with you?

01:25:41.437 --> 01:25:42.738
Yes.

01:26:15.504 --> 01:26:16.805
Pictures?

01:26:16.839 --> 01:26:18.874
Yes.

01:26:18.907 --> 01:26:20.576
And he asked you for these?

01:26:20.609 --> 01:26:23.212
Oh, hi. Thank you
for coming in, Mr. McCarthy.

01:26:23.246 --> 01:26:24.613
My pleasure.

01:26:24.647 --> 01:26:26.649
Why're you-- what,
what is he doing here?

01:26:26.682 --> 01:26:28.951
Oh, we need a parent present
while you speak with the police.

01:26:28.984 --> 01:26:30.719
Oh, he's not my father.

01:26:30.753 --> 01:26:32.988
He-- Well, parent or guardian.

01:26:33.021 --> 01:26:34.690
Please, sit.

01:26:34.723 --> 01:26:36.259
Thank you.

01:26:36.292 --> 01:26:38.694
How you doing, honey?
You alright?

01:26:38.727 --> 01:26:42.565
I came just as soon as I,
I could.

01:26:42.598 --> 01:26:46.469
Okay, um, so we can continue.

01:26:46.502 --> 01:26:49.572
You mentioned something
about pictures?

01:26:49.605 --> 01:26:50.839
Right, um...

01:26:53.342 --> 01:26:56.645
He asked me for pictures
after class one day.

01:26:57.713 --> 01:26:59.282
I was too nervous to send them,

01:26:59.315 --> 01:27:01.284
so I brought them in
on my phone,

01:27:01.317 --> 01:27:03.686
and he asked if he could
keep them for a few days.

01:27:03.719 --> 01:27:05.588
You know, to look at them.

01:27:05.621 --> 01:27:07.723
And, has he returned
the phone to you?

01:27:07.756 --> 01:27:11.894
No, it's probably still
in his desk.

01:27:34.016 --> 01:27:38.587
Now the last incident,
you said, occurred
in the school auditorium?

01:27:38.621 --> 01:27:39.822
Yes.

01:27:40.823 --> 01:27:41.890
When?

01:27:41.924 --> 01:27:45.060
Um, yesterday.

01:27:45.093 --> 01:27:46.629
And what time of day was this?

01:27:46.662 --> 01:27:49.332
This was just after school.

01:27:49.365 --> 01:27:51.467
He left a note in
my locker asking me

01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:53.702
to practice for the
showcase with him.

01:27:53.736 --> 01:27:56.405
I was, I was the understudy for
the scene from "The Crucible".

01:27:56.439 --> 01:28:02.077
Mmm-hmm. And what happened
when you went to meet with him?

01:28:02.110 --> 01:28:03.912
We were rehearsing.

01:28:03.946 --> 01:28:08.551
It's... it's a really
intimate scene.

01:28:08.584 --> 01:28:10.819
And we'd done it
together before,

01:28:10.853 --> 01:28:14.390
but, this time, it just,
it felt different, you know?

01:28:14.423 --> 01:28:17.793
He kept, he kept looking at me,
he wouldn't look away.

01:28:18.727 --> 01:28:22.565
And then, he kissed me.

01:28:24.467 --> 01:28:26.569
And did he threaten you?

01:28:26.602 --> 01:28:31.840
Say he was going to
hit you or try and
restrain you in any kind of...

01:28:40.015 --> 01:28:41.617
He said...

01:28:43.919 --> 01:28:47.590
he said, "You wanted this.

01:28:48.424 --> 01:28:49.925
Remember that."

01:28:54.062 --> 01:28:57.099
[Officer]
And what happened after that?

01:28:59.802 --> 01:29:01.470
He touched me.

01:29:10.579 --> 01:29:12.581
He asked me to
take off my shirt

01:29:12.615 --> 01:29:15.818
and he looked at me in my bra,
and he, he felt me up.

01:29:17.686 --> 01:29:20.589
And then he asked
if I wanted to see him.

01:29:23.559 --> 01:29:25.728
And what did you say?

01:29:27.896 --> 01:29:29.665
I said yes.

01:29:32.735 --> 01:29:35.571
But I didn't mean it, you know?

01:29:36.705 --> 01:29:39.875
I was just...

01:29:39.908 --> 01:29:41.844
I was just scared.

01:29:41.877 --> 01:29:45.914
And I... and I thought

01:29:45.948 --> 01:29:49.785
maybe if I did this,
he would stop hitting me.

01:29:53.188 --> 01:29:59.027
So he asked me
to take off my bra while...

01:30:02.164 --> 01:30:06.535
and then he looked at me

01:30:06.569 --> 01:30:08.971
and he said,

01:30:09.004 --> 01:30:12.608
"How many boys have
seen you like this?"

01:30:16.211 --> 01:30:19.582
You just think that
you matter, you know?

01:30:19.615 --> 01:30:21.917
The first time you think...

01:30:24.953 --> 01:30:26.755
that even if it
makes you sick

01:30:26.789 --> 01:30:29.024
that at least
you matter to somebody.

01:30:32.661 --> 01:30:35.030
And then you realize
that you don't.

01:30:35.063 --> 01:30:37.966
You don't matter,
you don't matter.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:43.506
I'm really sorry,
but I, I need you
to just go back a bit.

01:30:43.539 --> 01:30:45.574
You mentioned that he hit you?

01:30:50.145 --> 01:30:51.714
What?

01:30:51.747 --> 01:30:53.782
You just said that...

01:30:53.816 --> 01:30:56.051
that you thought
if you did this,

01:30:56.084 --> 01:30:58.554
he would stop hitting you.

01:31:00.222 --> 01:31:02.858
So when did this all start?

01:31:10.298 --> 01:31:12.701
A couple of years ago.

01:31:16.138 --> 01:31:17.973
-Alright.
-Don't touch me!

01:31:18.006 --> 01:31:19.274
-Hey!
-She's coming with me!

01:31:19.307 --> 01:31:20.976
-Calm down.
-Don't let him touch me!

01:31:21.009 --> 01:31:22.545
She needs a lawyer!
I have every right to be here!

01:31:22.578 --> 01:31:23.979
Please don't let him touch me!

01:31:24.012 --> 01:31:25.280
-[Officer] Step out of the room.
-Get out! Get out!

01:31:25.313 --> 01:31:26.281
-Out of the room!
-Get out!

01:31:26.314 --> 01:31:27.816
Just give her a minute.

01:31:27.850 --> 01:31:32.187
[sobbing]
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:32:33.616 --> 01:32:35.784
-Thank you.
-Hey.

01:32:35.818 --> 01:32:37.786
Thank you.

01:32:37.820 --> 01:32:39.722
It's okay.

01:32:39.755 --> 01:32:41.289
You're gonna be okay.

01:32:41.323 --> 01:32:42.891
Okay?

01:32:42.925 --> 01:32:44.259
Yeah.

01:32:47.730 --> 01:32:48.964
Here, I want you to,

01:32:48.997 --> 01:32:50.799
I want you to have this.

01:32:50.833 --> 01:32:53.736
You keep it, okay?

01:32:53.769 --> 01:32:56.071
It looks better on you
than it does on me.

01:32:56.104 --> 01:32:57.272
[laughs]

01:33:55.263 --> 01:33:57.399
[speaker beeping]

01:34:27.262 --> 01:34:29.064
Melissa Bowman.

01:34:29.097 --> 01:34:30.899
[door buzzes]

01:34:42.044 --> 01:34:45.113
[rock music, vocalizing]

01:34:55.090 --> 01:34:58.493
* What if I told you

01:34:58.526 --> 01:35:01.496
* You wanted someone quiet

01:35:01.529 --> 01:35:04.299
* I just kept runnin' fast

01:35:04.332 --> 01:35:07.402
* Away from my past

01:35:07.435 --> 01:35:10.806
* What did you say to me?

01:35:10.839 --> 01:35:13.909
* You got
a lot of night in ya

01:35:13.942 --> 01:35:17.079
* You're just a lion
with things to prove

01:35:17.112 --> 01:35:19.882
* So just keep lyin' to me

01:35:19.915 --> 01:35:23.018
* Just keep
tuckin' in my sheets

01:35:23.051 --> 01:35:26.021
* Tellin' me,
darlin, you're a fair one

01:35:26.054 --> 01:35:28.891
* And that you best
be scared of me

01:35:28.924 --> 01:35:32.761
* What if I said to you

01:35:32.795 --> 01:35:36.164
* Darling, your love
sapped all my strength

01:35:36.198 --> 01:35:38.967
* But you just took it away

01:35:39.001 --> 01:35:41.303
* I guess it's sad

01:35:41.336 --> 01:35:44.873
* Oh, you know,
'cause what's the use?

01:35:44.907 --> 01:35:47.242
* What's the use of tryin'?

01:35:47.275 --> 01:35:50.478
* She's in a room
with her eyes closed

01:35:50.512 --> 01:35:53.548
* She's
in a room with no windows

01:35:53.581 --> 01:35:56.384
* So dark

01:35:56.418 --> 01:35:59.454
* I was frightened of the night

01:35:59.487 --> 01:36:02.390
* Until I took it
in my hands, oh

01:36:02.424 --> 01:36:06.228
* Shut out all the light

01:36:11.133 --> 01:36:14.803
* What do I look like?

01:36:14.837 --> 01:36:17.339
* A little girl lost

01:36:17.372 --> 01:36:20.108
* A little lost cause

01:36:22.911 --> 01:36:26.481
* Is that pity in your eyes?

01:36:26.514 --> 01:36:29.584
* At least you wonder first

01:36:29.617 --> 01:36:32.888
* That it's supposed to hurt

01:36:32.921 --> 01:36:35.991
* So just keep pushin' me

01:36:36.024 --> 01:36:38.927
* Just keep tryin' harder

01:36:38.961 --> 01:36:41.864
* I'm not a hero or a martyr

01:36:41.897 --> 01:36:45.467
* Think I'm the villain
of the story

01:36:45.500 --> 01:36:48.203
* Oh, please

01:36:48.236 --> 01:36:51.239
* If you know
what's good for me

01:36:51.273 --> 01:36:54.342
* Then just keep me
feelin' lonely

01:36:54.376 --> 01:36:57.345
* It puts me on my knees

01:36:57.379 --> 01:37:00.482
* Oh, you know,
'cause what's the use?

01:37:00.515 --> 01:37:03.118
* What's the use of trying?

01:37:03.151 --> 01:37:06.354
* She's in a room
with her eyes closed

01:37:06.388 --> 01:37:09.424
* She's
in a room with no windows

01:37:09.457 --> 01:37:12.460
* So tired

01:37:12.494 --> 01:37:15.430
* I was frightened
of the night

01:37:15.463 --> 01:37:18.533
* Until I took it
in my hands, oh

01:37:18.566 --> 01:37:22.237
* And shut out all the light

01:37:22.270 --> 01:37:27.409
* Ah ah, the older I become

01:37:27.442 --> 01:37:30.545
* Less afraid of the dark

01:37:30.578 --> 01:37:34.282
* I'm more afraid
of growin' older

01:37:34.316 --> 01:37:36.318
* Mm-mm-mmm

01:37:36.351 --> 01:37:39.621
* So won't you kiss me
after that

01:37:39.654 --> 01:37:42.624
* 'Cause I know
just what I want

01:37:42.657 --> 01:37:46.528
* Just somethin' to believe in

01:37:46.561 --> 01:37:48.463
