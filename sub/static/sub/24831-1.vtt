00:03.551 --> 00:05.925
Okay, I don't know how many
of you are new and ...

00:05.925 --> 00:08.676
how many of you have been with us
from the start,

00:08.676 --> 00:11.259
but I am Laura Hollis.

00:11.259 --> 00:13.676
Yes, the Laura Hollis,

00:13.676 --> 00:15.384
who recently got famous,

00:15.384 --> 00:18.459
or internet famous,
because my university pals and I ...

00:18.459 --> 00:20.601
vloged ourselves saving the world.

00:25.518 --> 00:27.476
See back in my freshman year
We discovered that ...

00:27.476 --> 00:29.767
our Austrian university
was actually being run by ...

00:29.767 --> 00:32.201
an evil dean and her vampire cult.

00:32.500 --> 00:33.792
Naturally.

00:34.092 --> 00:36.383
They had been sacrificing girls to this ...

00:36.383 --> 00:38.350
monstrous creature under the campus ...

00:38.350 --> 00:40.876
for centuries and I was next.

00:41.676 --> 00:44.059
Really should have gone
to that safety school.

00:44.259 --> 00:45.551
Anyway,

00:45.551 --> 00:47.717
the dean sent Carmilla.

00:47.717 --> 00:49.951
I'm new
your roommate, sweetheart.

00:50.151 --> 00:51.892
A 300 year old, vampires ...

00:51.892 --> 00:53.267
with a checkered past and ...

00:53.267 --> 00:56.267
centuries worth of victims to kidnap me.

00:56.367 --> 00:59.376
There was just one little snag with that plan.

01:01.542 --> 01:04.042
Carm and I fell in love.

01:05.042 --> 01:06.583
Carm turned her back on ...

01:06.583 --> 01:10.250
the evil dean, 
and with a little help from our friends,

01:10.250 --> 01:12.501
Laf, Perry, Kirsch,

01:12.501 --> 01:15.709
Mel and Danny
we saved the school and ...

01:15.909 --> 01:17.467
the world.

01:18.267 --> 01:20.450
For stopping the apocalypse Carm ...

01:20.450 --> 01:23.426
earned herself a magical human life. A
vampire no more.

01:24.126 --> 01:25.126
A chance to ...

01:25.626 --> 01:28.617
start again and leave the crimes
of the past behind and ...

01:28.617 --> 01:30.726
for us to figure out ...

01:32.951 --> 01:35.484
whatever happens next.

01:37.000 --> 01:43.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:56.217 --> 01:58.842
Okay, weird.

02:04.676 --> 02:07.217
Old-timey and weird.

02:25.542 --> 02:28.000
Hello?

02:33.976 --> 02:36.559
Ghost lady?

02:52.483 --> 02:54.901
- You are wearing my brooch.
- Oh, Carm!

02:54.901 --> 02:57.967
Did I scare you my pet?

02:58.067 --> 03:00.717
You think?
dressed like Lizzie Borden?

03:01.317 --> 03:04.650
Wait. Why are you dressed
like Lizzie Borden?

03:04.750 --> 03:06.917
You mustn't be afraid.

03:06.917 --> 03:08.750
Why would I be afraid?

03:08.750 --> 03:12.259
We shall die as lovers may

03:14.442 --> 03:17.109
Die together ...

03:18.950 --> 03:21.242
so that we may live together.

03:33.918 --> 03:36.959
Welcome back cream puff

03:37.709 --> 03:40.959
Your horror movies are giving me nightmares.

03:42.876 --> 03:45.250
oh well, Life is rough like that some times.

03:47.584 --> 03:49.042
Come on.

03:49.442 --> 03:52.151
How long it takes
to kill one limping teenager?

03:53.051 --> 03:55.359
What is this guy on coffee break?

03:58.884 --> 04:00.759
So what happened? 
did you get scooped up by that ...

04:00.759 --> 04:02.967
talking goat again?

04:03.167 --> 04:06.742
No, I dreamed that you were a vampire.

04:08.175 --> 04:09.551
It was very blast from your ...

04:10.151 --> 04:12.817
Gothic horror past.

04:13.017 --> 04:16.642
There was this old house ...

04:17.459 --> 04:19.125
and you were actually kind of scary.

04:19.125 --> 04:20.916
Did I hurt you?

04:20.916 --> 04:22.201
In a dream.

04:23.301 --> 04:26.509
Come on, it was probably a
subconscious fascination with ...

04:26.509 --> 04:28.634
Victorian murders.

04:28.834 --> 04:30.983
Or...

04:30.983 --> 04:34.092
Corsets

04:36.318 --> 04:39.984
Well no need to go digging around in the past.

04:40.084 --> 04:42.917
we have it much better now. 

04:43.142 --> 04:44.975
No arguments here.

04:46.875 --> 04:48.942
So long hammer horror.

04:48.942 --> 04:51.318
Hello, rom-com.

06:39.111 --> 05:42.486
How Now Brown Cow

06:44.192 --> 06:46.950
Happy Anniversary
fainhfull viewers.

06:46.950 --> 06:49.451
I know, I know, I know.

06:49.451 --> 06:50.742
I've been behind on my posts, but ...

06:50.742 --> 06:52.575
I would never miss this,

06:52.575 --> 06:54.767
because five years ago today ...

06:54.767 --> 06:57.783
a rag tag bunch of undergraduates
stopped the dean of their evil university ...

06:57.783 --> 07:00.592
from unleashing hell on earth.

07:00.592 --> 07:04.267
Or, mostly stopped.
You can't really blame us for Antarctica.

07:04.667 --> 07:06.525
And where are they now?

07:06.525 --> 07:07.942
Well let's check in with  ...

07:07.942 --> 07:11.092
a very special, 5 year
retrospective.

07:13.525 --> 07:16.167
And we will cut too ...

07:23.367 --> 07:25.450
First up is Lafontaine
and Perry who ...

07:25.450 --> 07:28.283
as you recall, transfered to
Occult Studies at Berkeley ,

07:28.283 --> 07:30.283
and then started LaFerry Industries
where they ...

07:30.283 --> 07:32.275
have been revolutionizeing life 
for the supernatural with products like their ...

07:32.275 --> 07:34.609
Hemo-soy vegan vampire
nutritional supplements.

07:34.609 --> 07:37.192
ever since.
They got this huge meeting with a ...

07:37.192 --> 07:39.934
mega-corporation that
wants to buy their start up.

07:39.934 --> 07:40.892
I'm so proud.

07:41.292 --> 07:44.734
Speaking of super-successful people
you guys remember Danny,

07:44.734 --> 07:46.609
my Lit TA, turned

07:46.609 --> 07:47.817
stalwart ally, turned repentant vampire ...

07:47.817 --> 07:50.859
has turned into a vampire-rights advocate.

07:50.959 --> 07:53.309
And what retrospective would be complete

07:53.309 --> 07:55.059
without a look at 
how Mel and Kirsch and I ...

07:55.059 --> 07:57.650
leveraged our amateur coverage
of the almost apocalypse ...

07:57.650 --> 07:58.984
into a career
in local news.

07:59.884 --> 08:02.984
If you're morbidly curious,
here are some clips.

08:02.984 --> 08:04.859
Today we explore the fast paced world of floral arrangements ...

08:06.111 --> 08:08.800
cranberry banok, ceramic cephalopods.

08:10.759 --> 08:12.592
So yeah.

08:12.592 --> 08:14.942
Not quite achieved  
Lois Lane-dom.

08:16.042 --> 08:18.234
But never fear.

08:23.901 --> 08:27.167
It is all part of my 5 year plan.

08:34.109 --> 08:36.567
After Carm and I ...

08:36.567 --> 08:38.701
took our glorious gap year,

08:38.701 --> 08:42.034
it was time to start real
life. So we moved home to TO.

08:42.034 --> 08:44.792
I finished my degree
stuck my foot in the door.

08:44.792 --> 08:46.342
And now I'm waiting
for my big break,

08:46.342 --> 08:49.009
busting open some huge Woodward and
Bernstein style scandal,

08:49.009 --> 08:51.301
and being moved up to the city desk.

08:52.201 --> 08:53.925
Admittedly I have been ...

08:53.925 --> 08:56.217
waiting a while for that one.

08:56.217 --> 08:58.150
But you know that's what you do in life.

08:58.150 --> 08:59.150
you pay your dues.

09:00.650 --> 09:04.109
Unless you are a  former vampire
with 300 years of sunshine ...

09:04.109 --> 09:06.983
culinary history to catch up on.

09:06.983 --> 09:10.109
So what has our Carm been up to
as a living-breathing human?

09:11.234 --> 09:13.750
She's definitely taking advantage of ...

09:13.750 --> 09:15.325
ye old vampire trust fund.

09:15.325 --> 09:17.450
Bakery based gluttony, check.

09:17.450 --> 09:21.242
Suntanning sloth, check.

09:21.842 --> 09:24.842
I-have-a-pulse-now lust.

09:25.742 --> 09:27.842
Well ...

09:29.834 --> 09:32.717
Actually I can't
really complain about that last one.

09:35.151 --> 09:36.775
Yeah.

09:36.875 --> 09:39.142
Unless you count staring in
my spooky dreams,

09:39.142 --> 09:41.492
it's been a little
more pastry than purpose, lately.

09:41.792 --> 09:44.042
But today's retrospective ...

09:44.042 --> 09:46.109
perspective.

09:46.109 --> 09:49.150
We're going to get our heroine back on track.

09:49.150 --> 09:50.359
But...

09:50.359 --> 09:52.650
where to start such a conversation?

09:52.650 --> 09:54.583
Where else?

09:57.359 --> 09:59.567
With dessert.

10:00.567 --> 10:03.534
Have you been baking?

10:03.534 --> 10:05.742
Happy Re-Birthday.

10:09.942 --> 10:12.901
It's ... like a birthday,

10:12.901 --> 10:14.359
but only for your,

10:14.359 --> 10:17.917
rebirth because 5 years
ago you got a life.

10:18.417 --> 10:20.625
Not like a '90s
get a life but ...

10:21.125 --> 10:23.751
literally.

10:23.951 --> 10:26.218
How very Lewis Carroll.

10:30.825 --> 10:33.201
So speaking of 5 years ,

10:33.201 --> 10:35.950
I was thinking that
we could talk about ...

10:35.950 --> 10:37.576
5 years in the other direction.

10:38.776 --> 10:41.667
Because you've been through a lot.

10:42.067 --> 10:44.851
Not just Silas,
but Death.

10:45.051 --> 10:47.134
And the French revolution.

10:47.434 --> 10:50.134
So it's completely understandable that you're ...

10:50.134 --> 10:53.584
- feeling a little lost.
- Lost?

10:53.584 --> 10:55.909
Ok, maybe not lost, but ...

10:55.909 --> 10:59.467
maybe a little aimless.

10:59.767 --> 11:01.809
Laura, are you staging
an intervention ...

11:01.809 --> 11:03.759
because you think that I' m wasting my life?

11:03.759 --> 11:06.784
No! Maybe.

11:06.884 --> 11:08.592
It's Just...

11:09.492 --> 11:11.659
you aren't immortal anymore.

11:11.659 --> 11:13.826
And I know that you want to 
make the ...

11:13.826 --> 11:16.384
- most of your lives together.
- Is there something wrong with those ...

11:16.384 --> 11:18.759
lives being fun?

11:18.759 --> 11:20.009
No,

11:20.309 --> 11:22.976
but I think it's possible
to have fun and ...

11:22.976 --> 11:25.642
And did I go to
supernatural therapist?

11:25.642 --> 11:28.225
One time. You said you ...

11:28.225 --> 11:30.742
couldn't take advice from someone,
who was born after the moon landing.

11:30.742 --> 11:33.609
and do I pester you because you ...

11:33.609 --> 11:36.683
would rather spend your days in a  
news cubicle instead of ...

11:36.683 --> 11:39.550
on a beach in the South of France ?

11:39.550 --> 11:42.992
No you don't...

11:42.992 --> 11:44.642
- It's Just...
- It's Just...

11:44.642 --> 11:47.350
you like making plans,

11:47.350 --> 11:49.934
And I love that about you.

11:50.959 --> 11:51.834
But...

11:53.534 --> 11:56.142
It's my rebirth day.

11:56.142 --> 11:57.934
So...

11:57.934 --> 12:01.392
I want to spend it enjoying our lives.

12:01.392 --> 12:03.101
Preferably ...

12:03.501 --> 12:06.292
somewhere with a patio and a ...

12:06.292 --> 12:08.834
extensive wine selextion.

12:13.934 --> 12:16.100
And chocolates.

13:12.959 --> 13:15.067
- Carm?

13:18.383 --> 13:21.634
You're dreaming.

13:29.350 --> 13:31.642
Oh right.

13:37.083 --> 13:39.000
You are mine.

13:39.000 --> 13:42.083
You shall be mine.

13:42.083 --> 13:45.459
You and I are one,

13:46.559 --> 13:48.392
forever.

13:48.792 --> 13:50.309
Something tells me,

13:50.309 --> 13:53.225
I'm going to like this dream.

14:07.951 --> 14:10.609
Carm! What are you doing?

14:10.609 --> 14:12.709
Carm, Hey! It's me.

14:12.709 --> 14:14.459
It's me.

14:16.259 --> 14:18.067
Laura, your neck ...

14:18.367 --> 14:20.142
Oh, God.

14:31.392 --> 14:34.251
What is going on?

14:37.067 --> 14:39.418
Have you been in in close proximity to any 
vampires or vampire byproducts ...

14:39.418 --> 14:42.500
in the past 2-3 months?

14:42.500 --> 14:44.875
I you mean when a  Sumerian
goddess turned me again  ...

14:44.875 --> 14:47.251
last week? 
Must have slipped my mind.

14:47.751 --> 14:49.417
I see that sarcasm hasn't suffered .

14:49.417 --> 14:52.250
Thank you for taking some time
out of your meeting prep to help us.

14:52.250 --> 14:54.501
- You guys anything.
- Of Course.

14:54.501 --> 14:57.876
- We're probably over prepared.
- Something is definitely off...

14:57.876 --> 14:59.751
with Carm.

15:00.451 --> 15:01.209
For those of us
without a fancy ...

15:01.209 --> 15:04.359
cyborg eye?

15:05.267 --> 15:09.151
This is Carm, and she is
dead, except ...

15:09.151 --> 15:11.483
Except the resurrection spell
is still running inside of her ...

15:11.483 --> 15:14.109
and keeping her a living human. It makes her heart beat,

15:14.109 --> 15:15.467
hair grow and all of the 
other regular things ...

15:15.467 --> 15:18.634
- human body does.
- Like a magic battery.

15:18.634 --> 15:20.642
I thought we agreed that we weren't going to call it that.

15:20.642 --> 15:21.942
My vote is still with life force.

15:21.942 --> 15:23.751
- No, that's even ...
- What about ...

15:23.751 --> 15:26.501
- your spark?
- It does work pretty much ...

15:26.501 --> 15:28.667
- like an ignition.
- Spark it is.

15:28.667 --> 15:31.042
- Spark, spark, spark.
- I hope ...

15:31.042 --> 15:34.092
you are enjoying yourselves.

15:35.692 --> 15:38.209
Carmilla's spark is going out.

15:38.209 --> 15:40.683
- What's wrong with it?
- It's producing a sort of electrical ...

15:40.683 --> 15:42.934
discharges that is making it flicker ...

15:42.934 --> 15:45.476
and since it's what's,
keeping her human ,

15:45.476 --> 15:48.542
- when it flickers, she ...
- Vamps out.

15:49.884 --> 15:51.642
Okay, so ...

15:52.042 --> 15:56.259
How do we get my ... spark ...

15:56.259 --> 15:58.176
to stop flickering?

15:58.176 --> 16:00.250
We'll have to run some more tests.

16:00.250 --> 16:03.000
And in the mean time Carm
just keeps randomly vamping out?

16:03.600 --> 16:05.809
What are we supposed to do about that?

16:42.551 --> 16:43.842
First of all she was jazzed like,

16:43.842 --> 16:46.042
Oh, there will be a blueberry pie, right?
I'm into the bluebs.

16:46.042 --> 16:48.209
And t o top it all off,

16:48.209 --> 16:50.051
I get to the fridge and it's ...

16:51.210 --> 16:53.293
Carm?

16:54.500 --> 16:55.833
You okay?

16:56.675 --> 17:00.409
Sure, just grappleing with
an aversion to daylight and ...

17:00.409 --> 17:03.492
cravings for blood.
- Hey.

17:03.492 --> 17:05.809
Laf is going to figure something out.

17:05.809 --> 17:08.099
I know, its just ...

17:08.099 --> 17:10.309
this was supposed to be done.

17:10.309 --> 17:13.224
You know, blood lust,

17:13.224 --> 17:14.851
the self loathing,

17:14.851 --> 17:17.809
sleeping tied to a chair
in my own bedroom.

17:18.309 --> 17:21.351
That one might be overkill.

17:22.791 --> 17:26.875
You've never had a problem
controlling yourself before.

17:27.875 --> 17:29.917
Unless you count Dream Carm ...

17:29.917 --> 17:32.250
chasing me through
discount Transylvania all ...

17:32.250 --> 17:34.959
"You are mine, you shall be mine."

17:35.859 --> 17:37.966
Wait. What did you just say?

17:38.083 --> 17:40.734
"You are mine, you shall be mine."

17:40.734 --> 17:43.409
"You and I are one, forever."

17:48.109 --> 17:50.234
Carm, what is going on?

17:51.134 --> 17:53.842
it was just some silly Dracu-Poetry,

17:53.842 --> 17:56.850
my brain coughed up for atmosphere.

17:58.050 --> 17:59.749
What are you looking for?

18:07.017 --> 18:10.884
That House. This is where Elle and I lived.

18:11.575 --> 18:14.625
Was this the manor in your dreams?

18:17.142 --> 18:19.959
So this place Laura has been dreaming about the manor,

18:19.959 --> 18:22.542
- it's real?
- Not just the manor.

18:22.542 --> 18:23.851
Carm thinks that,

18:23.851 --> 18:25.309
from what I an describing ...

18:25.309 --> 18:27.576
house, the clothes what she says,

18:27.576 --> 18:30.267
that i am dreaming things,
that really happened ...

18:30.667 --> 18:33.001
150 years ago ...

18:33.501 --> 18:35.392
to Elle.

18:39.059 --> 18:40.934
Am I supposed to know who Elle is?

18:41.534 --> 18:43.918
Elle, the girl Carm turned 
on her mother and  ...

18:43.918 --> 18:46.975
- stoped being evil for.
- That wasn't Laura?

18:46.975 --> 18:49.334
Carmilla's epic first love?

18:49.334 --> 18:50.750
Also Laura?

18:50.750 --> 18:52.859
Remember our first year at Silas ...

18:52.859 --> 18:55.234
- those weird dreamsI was having?
"Only they weren't dreams,

18:55.234 --> 18:57.183
they were warnings from Carm's ...

19:01.592 --> 19:03.676
So you think the
dreams are from Elle?

19:03.676 --> 19:06.118
didn't she like sparkle off into floaty white nothingness ...

19:06.118 --> 19:08.909
after Carmilla
killed the giant angler fish god?

19:08.909 --> 19:10.692
How is that a sentence that I end up saying?

19:10.692 --> 19:13.067
There is only one way to 
find out. Go back to the scene ...

19:13.067 --> 19:16.067
of the crime.
If it's ghosts ...

19:16.067 --> 19:17.584
we can test the new spectrometer.

19:23.892 --> 19:25.267
Yeah, I'm going and ...

19:25.367 --> 19:28.909
I'm going to go crack anther bottle of hemo-soy.

19:37.859 --> 19:40.567
Hey, sorry about the whole scene of the crime thing.

19:40.567 --> 19:42.909
I what happened between you and
Elle was complicated.

19:42.909 --> 19:44.709
- I shouldn't have said that.
- No.

19:44.709 --> 19:47.126
Scene of the crime is exactly what it is.

19:47.126 --> 19:49.209
You saw those dreams.

19:49.209 --> 19:50.692
You know I ...

19:50.992 --> 19:52.992
hurt her.

19:53.592 --> 19:55.134
Hurt you.

19:55.134 --> 19:56.542
You didn't meant too.

19:57.342 --> 20:00.159
Maybe there is a silver lining
in all of this.

20:00.159 --> 20:02.534
If this is Elle trying to
warn us about something,

20:02.534 --> 20:03.951
maybe ... you can help her.

20:03.951 --> 20:08.325
I'm done being a vampire. I'm done dredging ...

20:08.325 --> 20:10.118
up the past. I'm done ...

20:10.118 --> 20:12.683
with well meaning therapists saying...

20:12.983 --> 20:15.459
"Close your eyes and
think of those you have wronged "

20:15.459 --> 20:18.184
"while I light up this funky incense. "

20:20.000 --> 20:21.792
That's right.

20:22.520 --> 20:25.020
We have plans and goals,

20:25.792 --> 20:29.875
and a color coded chart, 
none of which features,

20:29.875 --> 20:34.126
some mystery from your past
stealing the life that you earned.

20:34.626 --> 20:36.150
So we are going to figure out ...

20:36.150 --> 20:38.559
who or what is doing this who or what is doing this ...

20:38.559 --> 20:42.392
- Gruesomely murder them.
- Stop them.

20:43.717 --> 20:46.634
We're going back to Styria.

20:57.600 --> 20:59.518
<i> - Where are we going?
- Styria. </ I></i>

20:59.518 --> 21:01.518
<i> - Why are we going?
- To stop Carm ... </ i></i>

21:01.518 --> 21:03.692
<i> - from re-vamping.
- Okay, but really ... </ i></i>

21:03.692 --> 21:05.318
<i> why go to the bad place
with the monsters ? </ i></i>

21:05.318 --> 21:07.550
<i> Because of Elle's manor.
It's in my dreams. It's all connected.</ I></i>

21:07.550 --> 21:10.300
<i> and it's our only lead. </ i></i>

21:10.300 --> 21:12.483
<i> Schnitzel. </ i></i>

21:36.918 --> 21:40.417
How much farther till we get to this place?

21:41.401 --> 21:45.050
-It's Just ...
-Right around the corner.

21:49.984 --> 21:52.567
Oh yeah it's cool Laura, I've got your bag.

22:09.725 --> 22:12.142
You don't have to do this
if you don't want.

22:12.742 --> 22:15.118
You can just stay here if it's too much.

22:15.200 --> 22:17.058
And leave you alone to ...

22:17.058 --> 22:19.399
explore the mystery mansion?

22:19.417 --> 22:21.718
Hard pass.

22:27.592 --> 22:31.134
Hello.

23:00.034 --> 23:03.401
Hello, knock, knock.

23:03.801 --> 23:06.475
Elle's manor is pretty cool.

23:06.475 --> 23:09.034
I guess if you dig the Harrenhal vibe.

23:09.334 --> 23:11.442
Hello.

23:11.442 --> 23:12.651
Anybody?

23:12.751 --> 23:15.325
I'm calling it this place is totally haunted.

23:15.325 --> 23:18.617
You don't know that.
Maybe it's just ... creaky.

23:18.617 --> 23:22.025
A lovely example of a
19th century schloss.

23:23.234 --> 23:26.484
This is exactly like my dream. Beautiful.

23:26.484 --> 23:28.359
I mean, abandoned
and dusty, but ...

23:28.359 --> 23:29.692
beautiful.

23:29.692 --> 23:32.109
Oh well, we can deal with the dust.

23:32.109 --> 23:35.017
Tell me you did not bring an entire
bag of cleaning supplies.

23:35.017 --> 23:38.559
Of course I did. Do you know
what does dust does to expensive equipment?

23:38.959 --> 23:42.518
We have EMF detectors, Geiger
counters, various spectrometers.

23:42.518 --> 23:44.567
You didn't think that maybe we would need some actual weapons?

23:44.567 --> 23:46.018
Knowledge is really the best weapon ...

23:46.018 --> 23:48.018
Pretty sure weapons are the best weapon.

23:48.018 --> 23:51.934
Look at this princess.
Carbon fiber limbs,

23:51.934 --> 23:53.275
80 pound draw weight,

23:53.275 --> 23:55.692
Capable of shooting 160 feet per second.

23:55.692 --> 23:58.484
I call her ... Gertrude.

23:58.484 --> 24:00.859
- You're Excessive.
- Excessive?

24:00.959 --> 24:02.626
Do you remember our senior year?

24:02.726 --> 24:05.234
You were possessed by Carmilla's mom
the evil god ...

24:05.234 --> 24:07.401
who forced the entire student body including me ...

24:07.401 --> 24:10.117
to dig a pit to the literal 
gates of hell? Or how about that time ...

24:10.117 --> 24:11.909
that Lafontaine got brain
sucked by the giant angler fish monster ...

24:11.909 --> 24:15.125
Or how about that time
the evil baron ...

24:15.125 --> 24:17.842
tried to execute Carmilla?
Or that time that Laura sorta kinda

24:17.842 --> 24:19.534
- I don't know died.
- We do...

24:19.534 --> 24:22.242
have a lot of backstory.

24:22.642 --> 24:25.309
Fine.

24:25.309 --> 24:26.809
- Fine. Haunted.
- Tell me that at least you two ...

24:26.809 --> 24:29.117
- you packed some heat.
- I know Krav Maga. I...

24:29.117 --> 24:31.634
am a weapon. I brought
walkie talkie and flashlights ...

24:31.634 --> 24:34.642
for everyone. There is no signal service out here.

24:34.642 --> 24:36.942
- They're going to come in handy.
- How about you, Jughead?

24:37.742 --> 24:41.009
Vincent Van Bro brought beer.

24:42.817 --> 24:44.217
Is that her?

24:44.217 --> 24:45.634
Yeah.

24:47.183 --> 24:48.892
Let's search this place.

24:48.892 --> 24:51.284
For girl who died 150 years ago?

24:51.884 --> 24:54.667
Better not keep her waiting.

25:52.701 --> 25:54.483
Is that you?

25:54.483 --> 25:57.109
It was.

26:06.109 --> 26:08.276
We should be safe to push the
meeting until next week,

26:08.276 --> 26:10.734
- Dont you think?
- Do we have to talk about this right now?

26:10.740 --> 26:12.531
It's only the most important meeting of our professional careers.

26:12.531 --> 26:14.615
Per, we are searching a haunted castle for ghosts.

26:14.615 --> 26:16.798
This is literally the reason we started the company.

26:16.798 --> 26:19.440
- But if we had more resources ...
- Hold on, I think I got a hit.

26:19.468 --> 26:20.768
No, it's gone now.

26:21.240 --> 26:23.156
Now see as part of Intrigue, we would 

26:23.156 --> 26:24.848
have all of the equipment and
we could scan the whole house in like 2 seconds.

26:24.848 --> 26:27.440
Yeah, I get it but we're not 
selling out right this second so ... 

26:27.440 --> 26:29.523
can we focus on the task at hand?

26:30.217 --> 26:32.683
Let's check out the next room.

26:49.809 --> 26:52.225
Looking forward to seeing her?

26:52.250 --> 26:54.459
Elle, I mean.

26:55.034 --> 26:57.375
I wouldn't blame you if you were.

26:57.450 --> 26:59.492
Honestly, I would rather not.

26:59.992 --> 27:01.950
What am I supposed to say?

27:01.950 --> 27:03.984
I'm sorry I lied to you
and sacrificed you to a ...

27:03.984 --> 27:05.675
a fish monster?

27:06.175 --> 27:08.492
I doubt there is Hallmark card.

27:09.492 --> 27:11.951
It wasn't all your fault.

27:30.225 --> 27:32.018
I told her these were going to come in handy.

27:32.018 --> 27:34.901
<I> Ghosts. This schloss
full of ghosts. </ i>

27:37.225 --> 27:39.526
Ghost. Ghost.

27:39.826 --> 27:41.492
Everyone come on. Haunted house totally called it.

27:44.775 --> 27:46.151
- Come on.
- Oh crap.

27:46.751 --> 27:49.675
- Go, go.
- Perry, do something.
- It's stuck.

27:59.050 --> 28:00.276
Let me out.

28:11.959 --> 28:13.400
Hi.

28:14.500 --> 28:15.875
I'm Laura.

28:15.875 --> 28:18.218
These are my friends and 
we'd be thrilled if you'd ...

28:18.218 --> 28:20.234
abandon your plans to 
gruesomely murder us.

28:20.340 --> 28:22.631
Hello, Miss Karnstein.

28:25.025 --> 28:27.042
Hello.

28:29.225 --> 28:30.976
Wait, I know you.

28:31.976 --> 28:34.267
How do I know you?

28:34.267 --> 28:36.926
Oh, dear this is awkward.

28:36.926 --> 28:39.225
We imagined you would recall ...

28:39.225 --> 28:40.726
Killing us.

28:41.460 --> 28:45.401
- I'm Charlotte. This is my sister Emily.
-  Carmilla killed you?

28:45.401 --> 28:48.818
Oh no not quite exactly.

28:49.018 --> 28:51.151
Her mother did the Actual deed.

28:51.570 --> 28:52.587
You were the girls,

28:52.587 --> 28:55.379
who were sacrificed to the Deep One.

28:57.826 --> 28:59.767
Yes.

28:59.767 --> 29:01.342
We are the victims ...

29:01.342 --> 29:04.050
of Carmilla Karnstein ...

29:06.784 --> 29:10.075
and we would like to invite you
to dinner.

29:13.375 --> 29:17.125
It's wonderful that you have
all been able to join us.

29:17.425 --> 29:19.759
And naturally we are so glad ...

29:19.759 --> 29:21.517
you have arrived in time.

29:22.117 --> 29:25.118
- We've been waiting for weeks.
- For us?

29:25.418 --> 29:27.917
For Miss Karnstein.
We hoped once she had realized what had happened ...

29:27.917 --> 29:31.459
- she would return.
- Hold up, did you just confess  ...

29:31.459 --> 29:34.459
to flipping the vampire switch on
our girl Carm here?

29:34.459 --> 29:37.876
Goodness, no. We couldn't have.

29:37.876 --> 29:38.701
What little reseach ...

29:38.701 --> 29:40.350
we have been able to perform suggests ...

29:40.350 --> 29:42.801
It was Miss Karnstein's Life force that pulled us ...

29:42.801 --> 29:46.425
into the physical world.
Until a few weeks ago ...

29:46.425 --> 29:49.434
we were trapped
in a nightmare land,

29:49.434 --> 29:52.109
doomed to endlessly repeat our greatest regret.

29:52.109 --> 29:55.117
This nightmare afterlife, Is it more of a Jungian unconscious ...

29:55.117 --> 29:57.101
or a through the looking glass style situation?

29:57.101 --> 29:59.450
Stop that. I'ts not polite ...

29:59.450 --> 30:01.450
to pry into other
people's unspeakable sufferings.

30:01.450 --> 30:03.667
Why would you be connected to Carmilla's human life?

30:05.992 --> 30:07.934
We think it might be
because it it was ...

30:07.934 --> 30:09.917
Miss Karnstein who ...

30:09.917 --> 30:11.726
She's the reason we died.

30:13.826 --> 30:15.325
Yes.

30:15.325 --> 30:18.617
The family here offered my 
sister and I a place to lodge.

30:18.617 --> 30:20.909
they neglected to 
mention the vampire cult.

30:20.909 --> 30:23.609
Same thin happened with 
my college acceptance letter.

30:23.609 --> 30:26.967
You said you knew the family.
Does that meant that you know Elle?

30:29.467 --> 30:31.142
Miss Sheridan.

30:31.220 --> 30:33.470
Yes, we knew her.

30:34.870 --> 30:37.061
But she isn't here with you.

30:37.083 --> 30:38.775
No.

30:38.775 --> 30:41.359
She isn't with us.

30:42.390 --> 30:43.823
But...

30:43.823 --> 30:46.032
we're thrilled that you are.

30:47.701 --> 30:49.284
Okay, that's it.

30:49.784 --> 30:51.500
What's with Stepford Act?

30:52.200 --> 30:54.026
I got you and your sister killed.

30:54.026 --> 30:55.792
Yes, but you're here now.

30:55.792 --> 30:57.751
And according to this spell book ...

30:57.751 --> 30:59.501
we need
you Carmilla here...

30:59.501 --> 31:03.117
to perform the ritual that 
will let us move on.

31:04.317 --> 31:06.475
I don't suppose i could take a crack ...

31:06.475 --> 31:09.392
- at deciphering the book?
- Oh, please do.

31:09.392 --> 31:11.351
I have deciphered what I can, but ...

31:11.351 --> 31:12.892
I'm hardly an adapt.

31:13.592 --> 31:16.509
From what i can tell,
if we move on,

31:16.509 --> 31:17.942
your vampire symptoms ...

31:17.942 --> 31:20.384
will go away. I assume...

31:20.384 --> 31:21.976
thats why you've come.

31:22.890 --> 31:25.848
haven't you?

31:26.448 --> 31:30.241
Because otherwise you will be 
trapped here with us forever.

31:31.509 --> 31:33.101
<i> So their obviously evil. </ i></i>

31:33.101 --> 31:34.975
I thought they were kind of nice.

31:35.375 --> 31:39.509
More importantly is this ritual 
of theirs even going to fix me?

31:39.509 --> 31:41.134
- It looks promising.
- Promising?

31:41.740 --> 31:43.907
Are you telling me that you were
possessed by an evil goddess ...

31:43.907 --> 31:47.540
- for like 6 months and ...
- Eight. It was Eight months.

31:48.450 --> 31:50.450
and you can't get more specific than that?

31:50.850 --> 31:53.767
The entire book is written in code,

31:53.767 --> 31:55.476
but ... if Emily's notes
correct, it seems ...

31:55.476 --> 31:57.892
It's two birds, one stone.

31:57.892 --> 32:00.650
The ghosts move on,
Carmilla stays human.

32:00.650 --> 32:03.009
That makes sense. When
I scanned them, ...

32:03.009 --> 32:04.667
the energy of your spark
was going straight to them.

32:04.667 --> 32:07.375
Look for all we know they lured us in 
and trapped us here. Are we seriously...

32:07.375 --> 32:08.826
- going to trust them?
- What happened to them,

32:08.826 --> 32:10.409
wasn't their fault.
They were girls ...

32:10.409 --> 32:12.742
just like you and me,
with their whole lives ahead of them.

32:12.742 --> 32:15.275
If this ritual helps
them, and keeps Carmilla human 

32:15.275 --> 32:17.183
we have to try it.

32:30.351 --> 32:32.867
- Sweet. Is that a Gameboy?
- Even better.

32:32.867 --> 32:35.109
It's an EMF alarm. Might be nice to get a heads up ...

32:35.109 --> 32:36.867
if any ghosts come calling.

32:44.625 --> 32:48.209
- Listen, Per, about before ...
- Oh, I'm glad we postponed the meeting.

32:48.209 --> 32:50.709
- You are?
- With all the data we've collected here ...

32:50.709 --> 32:54.567
we're a much stronger barganing position.

32:54.667 --> 32:56.734
Really, Per?

32:57.234 --> 32:58.542
I know this is the 
big leagues, but ...

32:58.542 --> 33:00.876
why are you so pumped
to sell our company?

33:01.876 --> 33:02.825
Do you even know what I do all ...

33:02.825 --> 33:04.442
day, while you are off playing ...

33:04.442 --> 33:06.942
in your little lab?
I balance our budget,

33:06.942 --> 33:09.318
I get our products approved,
I handle the ...

33:09.318 --> 33:12.109
reckless endangerment  lawsuits. At Intrigue there would be...

33:13.309 --> 33:14.726
there would be...

33:14.726 --> 33:17.934
- a legal department, Laf.
- I see.

33:17.934 --> 33:18.976
And by playing ...

33:18.976 --> 33:21.718
you mean the research that 
makes our company possible?

33:21.718 --> 33:23.534
- This is not fair, I ...
- You know what?

33:23.534 --> 33:26.667
I am too tired to deal with this right now.

33:38.109 --> 33:40.259
Oh man we killed my sandwich.

33:44.409 --> 33:46.034
Five-second rule.

33:46.034 --> 33:48.959
Have we talked or have we not
had multiple conversations about about ...

33:48.959 --> 33:51.326
wandering away in the haunted house?

33:51.626 --> 33:54.018
I know, it's just that the ghosts
ladies are so nice. And you know ...

33:54.018 --> 33:56.392
- how I feel about leftovers.
- Kirsch, if your stomach gets ...

33:56.392 --> 33:59.467
me dragged into some kind of 
black girl dies first bulllshit.

33:59.667 --> 34:04.125
I'm going to come back from the 
dead and haunt your bar fridge.

34:11.300 --> 34:13.759
They aren't going to go along with it.

34:13.759 --> 34:16.009
They'll get caught up 
in the surprise you'll see.

34:16.009 --> 34:18.208
It will all come out exactly as we planned.

34:18.208 --> 34:19.766
Why aren't we just
telling them ...

34:58.259 --> 35:01.967
This again, really?

35:04.042 --> 35:06.175
<i> You would do well, little sister ... </ i></i>

35:08.883 --> 35:13.134
<i> We live for the eternal moment,
chérie. We are power. </ I></i>

35:18.392 --> 35:21.259
Be careful, my dear.

35:21.259 --> 35:22.484
<i>  You would do well, little sister to finish ... </ i></i>

35:22.484 --> 35:24.534
<i> your task here without further delay. </ i></i>

35:25.634 --> 35:28.226
Do think that our part in this ...

35:28.626 --> 35:31.318
that what we do might be,

35:31.318 --> 35:32.442
unforgivable?

35:32.742 --> 35:35.584
Stop reading the romantics.

35:36.384 --> 35:38.759
We live for the eternal moment, chérie

35:38.759 --> 35:42.184
We are the power, pleasue,

35:43.059 --> 35:45.851
we are only accountable 
for our desires

35:46.151 --> 35:48.034
And for mama who
is growing impatient.

36:13.092 --> 36:16.226
<i> You're wearing my brooch. </ i></i>

36:21.900 --> 36:26.526
<i> I don't want to go back. </ i></i>

36:31.700 --> 36:33.409
Alright?

36:34.359 --> 36:36.409
Another nightmare.

36:37.909 --> 36:40.242
You and Mattie were talking,

36:40.842 --> 36:42.717
she said something about an assassin,

36:42.717 --> 36:45.242
then these paper dolls are disintegrated ...

36:46.742 --> 36:47.559
I don't know.

36:47.559 --> 36:49.851
It seemed more coherent when it was happening.

36:50.251 --> 36:52.576
Wait, you are still having those dreams?

36:53.176 --> 36:55.350
But we're here.

36:55.350 --> 36:58.142
Why would you still be having them? Unless ...

36:58.542 --> 37:00.367
Something else is going on.

37:00.467 --> 37:02.418
Knocking. Still not a thing.

37:02.418 --> 37:04.476
The Hunger wanted a midnight snack,
and while he was getting it ...

37:04.476 --> 37:06.309
we caught our ghostesses,
talking about ...

37:06.309 --> 37:08.975
some sort of surprise we are not going to like
and sneaking into a ...

37:08.975 --> 37:11.283
locked room. So they are hiding ...

37:11.283 --> 37:13.909
something. Or someone.

37:14.909 --> 37:16.742
Hiding something?

37:16.742 --> 37:19.359
- How could we possibly ...
- What's behind the door?

37:19.359 --> 37:20.992
Why should that concern you?

37:20.992 --> 37:22.518
Maybe I don't like surprises.

37:22.518 --> 37:24.642
You look like woman who can cope.

37:25.042 --> 37:26.167
This could all be easily ...

37:26.167 --> 37:28.184
resolved by just,
showing us what ...

37:28.184 --> 37:30.642
- is behind door number one.
- Of Course.

37:30.642 --> 37:33.059
If you insist, but ...

37:33.059 --> 37:35.559
you'll ruin the surprise.

37:35.559 --> 37:38.600
We'll risk it.

37:40.618 --> 37:43.818
We'd kind of like to know if you're planing to ...

37:46.318 --> 37:48.193
throw a party?

37:48.751 --> 37:50.417
to thank you for helping us.

37:51.417 --> 37:53.925
- Your throwing a party?
- The ritual can't be ...

37:53.925 --> 37:56.384
performed until the ash moon begins ...

37:56.384 --> 37:59.467
- And Emily always loved to dress up.
- I can't imagine that ...

37:59.467 --> 38:01.509
you're a slouch in that department either.

38:01.809 --> 38:04.451
- You can't be serious?
- I think it's sweet.

38:04.451 --> 38:07.092
It's like a pre-ritual party,

38:07.092 --> 38:08.834
before they go away.

38:09.834 --> 38:10.792
Permanently.

38:10.892 --> 38:12.809
Exactly, and ...

38:13.509 --> 38:16.409
we would be honored if you would attend.

38:16.409 --> 38:17.934
Of course.

38:18.534 --> 38:20.218
Oh my gosh.

38:22.720 --> 38:25.920
Ball gowns? Are we going to get our strictly ballroom on?

38:25.920 --> 38:28.337
Best haunting ever.

38:35.234 --> 38:37.026
How is it going in there?

38:37.026 --> 38:40.534
BBC period dramas do not 
spend enough time on  how ...

38:40.534 --> 38:41.525
 complicated these cloths are.

38:41.525 --> 38:43.442
I swear I have been in here for 40 minutes.

38:44.942 --> 38:47.175
Hey thanks for going along with this by the way.

38:47.175 --> 38:49.942
Well what's there to go along with? I like Canapés ...

38:49.942 --> 38:51.859
- as much as the next girl.
- Still, it ...

38:51.859 --> 38:53.318
can't be fun hanging out with your ...

38:53.318 --> 38:57.317
- Former victims?
- No matter how nice they are.

38:57.317 --> 39:00.134
Yeah, well I'd appreciate it if 
they took it down a notch

39:00.134 --> 39:01.883
You prefer a roaring rampage of revenge?

39:01.883 --> 39:04.842
Yeah, all this forgiveness
is making me twitchy.

39:05.842 --> 39:07.034
You think maybe that's because  ...

39:07.034 --> 39:09.709
deep down you still don't think that you can be forgiven?

39:10.509 --> 39:12.417
I see we have reached ...

39:12.417 --> 39:15.609
amateur psychoanalysis round.

39:15.609 --> 39:18.676
You see this is why I blew off that therapist.

39:18.876 --> 39:20.751
Some things are too much to ...

39:20.751 --> 39:23.626
talk about in an office full of crystal dolphins.

39:24.026 --> 39:26.292
Think that maybe thats the point of the talking?

39:26.292 --> 39:28.142
Except it wasn't just talking.

39:28.142 --> 39:30.451
There was this manifest...

39:33.101 --> 39:35.550
You aren't saying anything?

39:37.250 --> 39:40.317
Did I put it on wrong?

39:40.317 --> 39:42.008
I look ridiculous 
I do I look ridiculous

40:04.684 --> 40:07.225
40 minutes to get you in to that, huh?

40:08.325 --> 40:12.192
Bet I could get you out of it faster.

40:21.900 --> 40:25.226
We already going to be late for the ball.

40:25.226 --> 40:28.450
So let us be late.

42:50.259 --> 42:52.525
I'm Coming.

43:18.442 --> 43:21.225
Looking good, Frosh.

43:23.600 --> 43:27.226
- What?
- May I have this dance?

43:28.150 --> 43:30.409
Come on.

43:35.709 --> 43:38.084
I'm sorry about the way
I handled things last night.

43:38.084 --> 43:40.142
It's alright i know you 
didn't mean any of it.

43:40.142 --> 43:42.951
It may have been a little bit harsh 
but that doesn't mean that I was wrong.

43:42.992 --> 43:44.845
let's not fight in front 
of the ghosts, honey.

43:53.725 --> 43:57.059
It's not your thing either, huh?

43:58.542 --> 44:02.751
Emily has always wanted
to belong to society.

44:02.751 --> 44:05.418
I understood life differently.

44:06.618 --> 44:08.000
If you have to conform  ...

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
you never belonged.

44:10.200 --> 44:12.025
Ok, how did you fall for  ...

44:12.025 --> 44:14.201
Vamperella's shtick?

44:14.601 --> 44:16.475
I didn't.

44:16.475 --> 44:18.684
But my sister has disappeared.

44:18.684 --> 44:21.767
I went looking for her.

44:22.618 --> 44:24.825
She's never forgiven herself.

44:25.225 --> 44:26.934
And what about you?

44:27.234 --> 44:29.817
If I didn't leave her then,

44:30.417 --> 44:33.483
how could I now?

44:33.492 --> 44:37.075
You want to try 
this stupid dance?

44:38.475 --> 44:40.726
Obviously.

45:03.509 --> 45:04.551
This is nice.

45:06.151 --> 45:08.551
Kind of like that grand ball we never 
got because our school was a ...

45:08.551 --> 45:12.017
supernatural death trap.

45:13.683 --> 45:15.351
I missed this.

45:16.451 --> 45:19.576
I mean not the pulse pounding terror but, the parts ...

45:19.776 --> 45:21.150
where we help people.

45:21.150 --> 45:24.059
But I do wish we would figure 
out why the ghosts were here ...

45:24.059 --> 45:25.975
in the first place.

45:26.975 --> 45:27.900
Hey, Laura ...

45:27.900 --> 45:30.917
I know. No need to keep prying.

45:31.017 --> 45:32.600
The ghosts will  move on.

45:32.600 --> 45:35.559
You'll get your life back and ...

45:35.759 --> 45:37.718
We can go home.

45:38.218 --> 45:40.259
No I ...

45:40.459 --> 45:41.359
I think at the 

45:41.359 --> 45:44.067
the therapist
appointment I may have ...

45:50.800 --> 45:53.050
Laura?

45:54.617 --> 45:57.034
Sorry.

45:58.683 --> 46:01.476
Weird déjà vu.

46:10.826 --> 46:12.334
What's going on?

46:12.334 --> 46:14.075
I thought I saw

46:14.075 --> 46:17.284
the woman in black  ... you.

46:17.951 --> 46:20.275
The you from my dreams, but ...

46:22.575 --> 46:26.242
That's impossible, Right?

46:26.792 --> 46:29.834
Come on lets sit down.

46:36.459 --> 46:39.334
I'll get you a drink, ok.

46:45.283 --> 46:48.242
come with me
loving me to death or ...

46:48.242 --> 46:51.076
else hate me, and still come with me,

46:51.076 --> 46:53.125
hating me through death and ...

46:53.125 --> 46:53.984
after.

46:58.009 --> 47:00.550
Are you okay?

47:10.109 --> 47:11.267
Where is she?

47:11.267 --> 47:13.067
She was right here.

47:13.067 --> 47:14.918
- What's going on, Hollis?
- The woman in black.

47:14.918 --> 47:17.834
- The one wearing a mask.
- Everyone is wearing a mask.

47:18.534 --> 47:19.284
You know...

47:19.284 --> 47:20.792
who she is talking about?

47:21.692 --> 47:24.883
Maybe if you are not feeling 
well you should sit down.

47:24.883 --> 47:27.792
I dreaming things while I'm awake now.

47:27.792 --> 47:30.292
What's next?

47:35.626 --> 47:37.709
It's almost time.

47:37.709 --> 47:40.334
The ash moon has begun.

47:40.334 --> 47:42.459
Gather round for the ritual.

47:42.459 --> 47:45.384
Before we begin,
I want to say ....

47:45.384 --> 47:47.676
how grateful we are.

47:47.676 --> 47:49.551
Whatever you have done in the past,

47:50.351 --> 47:52.392
you have come to help us now,

47:52.392 --> 47:55.975
and I think that shows a strength of character ...

47:55.975 --> 47:58.934
that is quite remarkable.

47:59.526 --> 48:02.025
Yeah, sure.

48:02.725 --> 48:05.926
It's time, Emily.

48:07.134 --> 48:09.425
It's your last night
on the earth. Are you sure you ...

48:09.425 --> 48:12.042
want another drink before you go?

48:12.042 --> 48:14.859
The ritual must be performed before the ash moon,

48:14.859 --> 48:18.267
ends at sunrise. Otherwise
we're trapped here forever.

48:18.267 --> 48:21.517
So no.

48:31.934 --> 48:33.967
Wait that's the brooch that I ...

48:36.783 --> 48:39.542
- Carm?

48:41.542 --> 48:44.501
That's Carmilla's spark.

48:45.483 --> 48:49.534
It's leaveing her. Why
is it going into the brooch?

48:51.034 --> 48:52.659
- Guys?
- Weird did that spell  ...

48:52.659 --> 48:54.492
say anything about spirit entanglement?

48:54.492 --> 48:55.992
It's not supposed to happen like this.

48:55.992 --> 48:56.890
Something wrong.

48:56.890 --> 48:58.890
Laura, stay back. It's dangerous.

48:58.890 --> 49:00.557
- We have to stop the ritual.
- I can't.

49:00.657 --> 49:03.832
- It's out of control.
- Emily, no.

49:04.634 --> 49:07.651
We have been tricked.
I don't want to go back.

49:07.651 --> 49:09.492
We need to disrupt the connection.

49:10.992 --> 49:14.700
- Don't touch Carmilla.
- It will take you too.

49:26.450 --> 49:30.325
Did you think that you would get away with it?

49:31.275 --> 49:34.567
Summon us up to ease
your mind and, then ...

49:34.567 --> 49:35.734
and then just waltz away?

49:35.734 --> 49:39.442
Did you really think that
there would be no consequences?

49:43.860 --> 49:45.860
It's you.

49:46.125 --> 49:47.751
Surprise.

49:48.851 --> 49:52.542
Not the brightest little ingenue, are we?

50:19.000 --> 50:21.292
Is that pile of dust Lafontaine?

50:21.292 --> 50:24.083
They're just ... gone.

50:24.083 --> 50:27.217
- Are you okay?
- Carm?

50:27.217 --> 50:28.967
- I need to hide.
- Carm?

50:28.967 --> 50:31.301
Carm ?!

50:37.050 --> 50:40.950
Carm!

51:11.700 --> 51:15.442
Your heart it's not beating.

51:16.447 --> 51:20.105
- You're a vampire.
- No!

51:20.375 --> 51:21.792
Why won't it work?

51:21.792 --> 51:23.792
I've sent all the ghosts away.

51:33.076 --> 51:35.200
Did one of them escape me?

51:38.501 --> 51:40.459
I miss something
or did that radically ...

51:40.459 --> 51:41.834
- not go as planned?
- It was Elle.

51:41.834 --> 51:44.592
She was at the masquerade. She knew 
about the ritual. She knew exactly...

51:44.592 --> 51:46.984
- what was going to happen.
- How could she have know?

51:46.984 --> 51:48.984
Because Emily and Charlotte
lied to us.

51:48.984 --> 51:50.676
They had to know she was here.

51:50.676 --> 51:53.201
You think vacuumed screaming 
back to a hellish nightmare scape ...

51:53.201 --> 51:55.450
was part of their plan?

51:56.250 --> 51:58.000
Sorry.

51:58.500 --> 52:01.750
We will figure this out.
We will find Laf.

52:02.050 --> 52:04.309
Why would Elle do this?

52:04.309 --> 52:05.392
You hear her ...

52:05.392 --> 52:08.617
to punish me for what I did. 
Stealing my life.

52:08.617 --> 52:10.734
But she can't steal anything.
She's trapped here,

52:10.734 --> 52:12.492
just like us, unless 
all the ghosts move on.

52:12.492 --> 52:14.367
But all the ghosts
are gone. Except...

52:14.367 --> 52:17.101
Elle and Charlotte. Elle can't leave until Charlotte ...

52:17.101 --> 52:18.850
is also sent back to 
the nightmare land ...

52:18.850 --> 52:21.351
like all the other ghosts. Laf thwarted her plan.

52:21.451 --> 52:23.418
And now that my spark is in the brooch,

52:23.418 --> 52:26.750
and Elle, has the brooch
if she gets rid of Charlotte ...

52:26.750 --> 52:30.109
she could become human and leave.

52:32.184 --> 52:34.892
We have to find her. Now.

52:35.392 --> 52:37.726
That's easier said than done.

52:37.726 --> 52:39.242
Miss Sheridan has gone, girl.

52:39.242 --> 52:40.992
Not to mention that
we don't exactly know how ...

52:40.992 --> 52:43.451
how to extract the life force from the magical brooch.

52:43.751 --> 52:47.342
Might want to go easy on those 
thats the only case.

52:47.342 --> 52:49.009
Terrific.

52:49.009 --> 52:51.717
But ... Elle must have
the spell already . I mean that's ...

52:51.717 --> 52:53.051
her escape plan right?

52:53.051 --> 52:55.475
So have to find Elle,
before she gets to Charlotte,

52:55.475 --> 52:56.773
then Perry can find the spell
to put your spark back ...

52:56.773 --> 52:59.181
Laura what are you talking about?
We have to find Laf first.

52:59.181 --> 53:01.223
Of course, of course, we 
have to find both of them, but ...

53:01.223 --> 53:02.781
if we lose Elle now, all of 
us are going to be ...

53:02.783 --> 53:04.875
We can find Elle later.
Laf comes first.

53:04.875 --> 53:08.959
We can't just let her
take Carmilla's life.

53:14.000 --> 53:15.750
We could start in the study.

53:16.550 --> 53:19.342
I can not believe I'm saying this,
but beefcheeks is right.

53:19.859 --> 53:23.159
We don't have much time.

53:25.576 --> 53:27.075
I need to get out of this dress.

53:27.075 --> 53:29.509
- It will be easier if you let someone help ...
- Did you summon up the ghosts,

53:29.509 --> 53:32.675
Because that's what she said 
Elle, that you summoned her up.

53:32.675 --> 53:36.959
- I think it's possible. 
- Possible?
  How do you not know ...

53:36.959 --> 53:38.751
whether you summoned up the 
ghosts of your former victims, who ...

53:38.751 --> 53:41.583
- maybe want some light refreshing revenge?
- Because ...

53:41.583 --> 53:44.734
it was just something stupid that 
happened at that therapists appointment.

53:44.734 --> 53:45.818
What?

53:45.818 --> 53:49.117
She said I could never
move forward unless  ...

53:49.117 --> 53:52.075
I deal with my past.
So ... she had me think about Elle,

53:52.075 --> 53:54.634
and the others, and
you know, there was the usual ...

53:54.634 --> 53:58.601
Manifest your issues
crap, but ... I had forgoten ...

53:58.601 --> 54:00.642
all about it until my issues...

54:00.642 --> 54:02.567
actually manifested.

54:02.567 --> 54:05.284
When were you going to share this 
little piece of information with me?

54:05.284 --> 54:06.992
I was waiting for the right moment.

54:06.992 --> 54:09.292
You know what would have been 
a good moment? Any time before ...

54:09.292 --> 54:13.126
before the ghost of your 
former lover killed you.

54:14.726 --> 54:18.559
She killed you.

54:19.034 --> 54:20.351
I thought she killed you.

54:20.351 --> 54:23.767
Hey, Come here.

54:23.784 --> 54:25.742
I'm still here.

54:26.300 --> 54:29.008
okay, I am still here.

54:29.808 --> 54:33.558
Were going to get my life back okay?

54:34.158 --> 54:36.575
And all those things we want,

54:36.575 --> 54:37.641
every single point on your  ...

54:37.641 --> 54:42.225
five year plan
we're going to do them, okay?

54:43.709 --> 54:47.751
okay, let's get you out of this thing.

54:48.451 --> 54:49.801
Either Emily
decoded the spell wrong ...

54:49.801 --> 54:52.134
or Elle tricked her.

54:52.434 --> 54:54.351
The spell she did cast,
used Carmilla's spark ...

54:54.351 --> 54:56.534
to force the ghosts off 
to the nightmare land ...

54:56.534 --> 54:58.292
that Emily described.

54:58.292 --> 55:01.667
Do you think that's where the brainiac ended up?

55:03.000 --> 55:04.708
You think that you can get them back?

55:05.159 --> 55:07.242
I think that the real moving
on spell might do it.

55:07.242 --> 55:09.659
But that means that we 
only have until sunrise ...

55:09.659 --> 55:13.992
to find the code key. And 
we need Carmilla's spark.

55:14.392 --> 55:16.659
That makes getting the 
brooch back priority one.

55:16.659 --> 55:19.409
Hollis will be chefed.

55:19.909 --> 55:21.034
Perry ...

55:21.034 --> 55:25.059
Lafontaine knows you are looking for them.

55:25.059 --> 55:27.126
They know.

55:27.226 --> 55:29.725
It's what we do.

55:42.518 --> 55:44.725
Its done.

55:44.725 --> 55:46.101
We leave tonight.

55:46.101 --> 55:48.601
In three days we will be on 
an ocean liner headed for ...

55:48.601 --> 55:51.267
New York.

55:59.092 --> 56:01.259
Your going to love New York.

56:01.359 --> 56:04.450
It's full of concerts, and

56:04.450 --> 56:06.350
theater, and

56:06.350 --> 56:08.350
life.

56:08.450 --> 56:09.800
Your life's going to be so much bigger ...

56:09.800 --> 56:13.509
than you ever imagined.

56:15.575 --> 56:18.125
What are you doing?

56:31.917 --> 56:33.926
Laura!

56:33.926 --> 56:36.717
Hey are you alright?

56:39.459 --> 56:44.001
What in Stoker's name, is going on?

56:44.701 --> 56:47.243
So Elle can dream-kebab 
you in real life?

56:47.243 --> 56:49.159
Is that a normal ghost thing?
Were we supposed to know that,

56:49.159 --> 56:51.034
- they can do that?
- She sent me dreams before.

56:51.625 --> 56:54.067
This is the first time she has 
reached out and slashed me.

56:54.067 --> 56:55.692
- Oh, dear.
- No no no.

56:55.692 --> 56:57.967
Not oh dear, we do not 
need an oh dear right now.

56:57.967 --> 57:00.467
I'm still deciphering but there,
are still several in this book,

57:00.467 --> 57:03.617
which make ghosts much more powerful especially ...

57:03.617 --> 57:06.076
in the dream world.

57:06.076 --> 57:09.242
So Elle is better, faster, stronger.

57:09.242 --> 57:10.659
Can we undo that?

57:10.659 --> 57:12.367
Use the book
to soup ourselves up?

57:12.367 --> 57:15.709
"Side effects may include
anxiety, insomnia,

57:15.709 --> 57:18.400
dream contagion and ... death. "

57:18.400 --> 57:20.026
So no.

57:20.826 --> 57:23.701
Wait. dream contagion? Is that like ...

57:24.201 --> 57:26.709
Sometimes, in the dreams it's 
as if she can't completely ...

57:26.709 --> 57:28.709
control them. Like I am seeing 
things that she wouldn't want me ...

57:28.709 --> 57:31.026
to see. Like just now I saw
you getting ready to leave ...

57:31.026 --> 57:33.442
for New York.

57:34.442 --> 57:36.017
Nobody is going anywhere until ....

57:36.017 --> 57:37.184
we find Charlotte.

57:37.584 --> 57:40.234
The Craft here, will 
keep researching You, Mel and ...

57:40.234 --> 57:42.775
the frat boy can ...

57:44.676 --> 57:47.134
- Where's the frat boy?
- That burrito chomping,

57:47.134 --> 57:50.426
protein powder snorting gullible mush-brained ...

57:51.426 --> 57:53.426
Dope.

57:53.426 --> 57:55.026
I told him.

57:55.026 --> 57:56.067
It's the same as Laf.

57:56.067 --> 57:58.651
Okay, we have to find Charlotte
and we have to get that brooch,

57:58.651 --> 58:00.109
back before Elle finishes this ...

58:00.109 --> 58:02.276
reenactment of "And Then There Were None."

58:02.376 --> 58:05.125
Search every nook and cranny.
Charlotte has to be somewhere.

58:05.125 --> 58:09.209
Be careful. Elle knows this 
place better than we ever will.

58:37.225 --> 58:40.684
The girls are caterpillars while 
they live in the world, to be ...

58:40.684 --> 58:44.000
finally butterflies when summer comes.

58:44.000 --> 58:46.825
But in the meantime, the're grubs and larvae.

58:46.825 --> 58:48.959
So says Monsieur Bouffon.

58:48.959 --> 58:51.959
Think of the trouble i went to,

58:51.959 --> 58:53.375
warning you.

58:53.975 --> 58:57.809
Thinking you would 
learn from my mistake.

58:58.434 --> 59:00.559
Yeah, because Carm is the villain here?

59:00.759 --> 59:03.575
Aren't you the one zapping 
innocent people for no reason?

59:03.575 --> 59:05.325
I'm doing it to keep what's mine.

59:05.325 --> 59:07.742
- That life isn't yours.
- It's what I'm owed.

59:07.742 --> 59:12.450
And I wouldn't waste it on
some banal five-year plan.

59:13.150 --> 59:14.376
- Laf?

59:17.650 --> 59:20.026
Laf. I saw Laf.

59:21.126 --> 59:22.834
Drawing some kind of symbol.

59:22.834 --> 59:25.626
It looked like this. Or...

59:25.626 --> 59:27.176
maybe like ...

59:27.176 --> 59:29.509
this.

59:29.509 --> 59:31.009
how did you get past second grade?

59:31.009 --> 59:33.259
I saw it fore half a second in a
ghost induced nightmare.

59:33.259 --> 59:36.425
- Give me a break.
- Any idea what it means?

59:36.425 --> 59:37.842
No, but ...

59:37.842 --> 59:40.867
if Laf thinks it's important enough,
to send form beyond the veil ...

59:40.867 --> 59:43.118
if I could ...

59:43.118 --> 59:44.992
just identify it, maybe
it could help decipher the  ...

59:44.992 --> 59:47.118
moving on spell.
I'll try to figure this out ...

59:47.118 --> 59:48.784
- while you guys go ...
- Get a life.

59:49.784 --> 59:52.892
- Go with her. Keep her safe.
- And what are yougoing to do?

59:52.892 --> 59:54.800
Well, young lady
stole my life and ...

59:54.800 --> 59:56.759
back into a vampire.

59:56.959 --> 59:58.959
So in going to remind 
her what that means.

59:59.059 --> 01:00:02.059
- How about you?
- I've got the EMF.

01:00:02.059 --> 01:00:04.559
If so much as peeps, I shriek.

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:39.834
I used to think,
you and I would spend our lives ...

01:00:39.834 --> 01:00:42.001
reading to each other.

01:00:42.784 --> 01:00:44.267
If only i had known how one ...

01:00:44.267 --> 01:00:45.859
of those lives was going to be.

01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:49.991
Hello, Elle.

01:00:53.100 --> 01:00:55.599
Is that all you have to say to me?

01:00:56.117 --> 01:00:58.034
After what you did.

01:00:58.334 --> 01:01:01.000
I never meant to hurt you.

01:01:02.809 --> 01:01:04.934
Don't apologize.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.584
It cost you nothing.

01:01:09.375 --> 01:01:10.751
So what?

01:01:11.451 --> 01:01:13.992
This is about me paying for my sins?

01:01:14.692 --> 01:01:16.509
You never even stopped to think ...

01:01:16.509 --> 01:01:18.800
if you deserve this life.

01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:22.301
I've watched you.

01:01:22.601 --> 01:01:24.942
All these years...

01:01:24.942 --> 01:01:25.783
you've never thought ...

01:01:25.783 --> 01:01:27.618
of anyone but yourself.

01:01:28.918 --> 01:01:31.742
Well thats some big talk ...

01:01:31.742 --> 01:01:32.592
coming from the girl who ...

01:01:32.592 --> 01:01:35.384
sent her friends to a nightmare land.

01:01:35.484 --> 01:01:36.983
Me?

01:01:36.983 --> 01:01:38.942
No, No, I'm just thinking about myself.

01:01:39.042 --> 01:01:41.459
Wait, I wonder who taught me that?

01:01:47.375 --> 01:01:49.834
Not very ladylike, Miss Karnstein.

01:01:51.234 --> 01:01:52.626
Laura.

01:01:52.626 --> 01:01:55.584
Better run, Carmilla.

01:01:55.692 --> 01:01:59.318
These old houses are so dangerous after all.

01:01:59.918 --> 01:02:03.342
Damn it, Perry.
We should have never...

01:02:03.342 --> 01:02:06.367
- left her alone.
- No sign of the spell book either.

01:02:06.367 --> 01:02:08.683
I take it your little chat with 
the ghost of girlfriends past ...

01:02:08.683 --> 01:02:10.434
- was a bust?
- Yes, I'm getting pretty sick of  ...

01:02:10.434 --> 01:02:14.559
- this haunting crap.
- Imagine how we feel?

01:02:15.009 --> 01:02:17.309
I'm wondering if we might be of,

01:02:17.309 --> 01:02:18.226
assistance to each other.

01:02:18.526 --> 01:02:21.342
Miss Sheridan said you would 
never go along with the spell if you ...

01:02:21.342 --> 01:02:23.200
knew she was with us.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.818
I should have known that she only
wanted your life for herself.

01:02:27.818 --> 01:02:29.967
It was all she ever talked about,

01:02:29.967 --> 01:02:32.534
the wide would that she had been denied ...

01:02:32.734 --> 01:02:37.025
as if the same thing 
hadn't happed to us all.

01:02:38.876 --> 01:02:40.834
I'm sorry about your friend.

01:02:41.434 --> 01:02:44.725
I didn't know what would happen
happen when they pulled me back.

01:02:45.425 --> 01:02:49.300
Can you help us get them back?

01:02:50.042 --> 01:02:51.875
I don't know, but ...

01:02:52.475 --> 01:02:54.475
we have to stop Miss Sheridan.

01:02:54.475 --> 01:02:56.892
And do you have any thoughts on the stopping front?

01:02:58.592 --> 01:03:01.059
It's me she wants,

01:03:01.059 --> 01:03:03.518
so perhaps ...

01:03:11.967 --> 01:03:16.217
Do we really have to do 
this nightmare on elm street crap?

01:03:16.517 --> 01:03:19.126
Fine.

01:03:22.801 --> 01:03:26.550
Let's speak as reasonable women.

01:03:31.534 --> 01:03:32.984
So,

01:03:32.984 --> 01:03:34.917
your friends are...

01:03:34.917 --> 01:03:37.167
trapped beyond the veil.

01:03:37.667 --> 01:03:40.209
You, Carmilla and your ...

01:03:40.209 --> 01:03:42.201
trigger happy accomplice ...

01:03:42.201 --> 01:03:44.451
are next. Sugar?

01:03:44.451 --> 01:03:46.700
Sure.

01:03:48.176 --> 01:03:49.509
But...

01:03:50.009 --> 01:03:52.392
if you hand over Charlotte and ...

01:03:52.392 --> 01:03:54.767
- let me keep this life ...
- It isn't...

01:03:54.767 --> 01:03:58.517
- yours to keep.
- That's beside the point.

01:03:58.517 --> 01:04:02.684
Let me keep it and I'll
 bring your friends back.

01:04:03.884 --> 01:04:05.659
You can all ...

01:04:05.659 --> 01:04:08.950
leave this place.

01:04:12.725 --> 01:04:14.850
What happens to Charlotte?

01:04:15.950 --> 01:04:17.084
Well, I'm afraid ...

01:04:17.084 --> 01:04:20.018
poor Charlotte will have to
follow her sister, but ...

01:04:20.018 --> 01:04:21.475
you knew that was always going,

01:04:21.475 --> 01:04:23.750
- to happen didn't you.
- She's just like you.

01:04:23.950 --> 01:04:28.117
They all are. Don't they 
deserve a chance to move on?

01:04:33.284 --> 01:04:35.409
You haven't figured it out yet.

01:04:36.409 --> 01:04:37.992
The only way,
that Charlotte and ...

01:04:37.992 --> 01:04:40.000
Emily can reach ...

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.167
their everlasting rest ...

01:04:42.367 --> 01:04:43.734
is if Carmilla sacrifices ...

01:04:43.734 --> 01:04:46.609
her human life.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.626
So.

01:04:51.676 --> 01:04:52.742
Let's not pretend that  ...

01:04:52.742 --> 01:04:54.400
you'd sacrifice Carmilla's life ...

01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:56.075
for few wayward spirits,

01:04:56.675 --> 01:04:58.509
- any more than I would.
- We can't just leave them ...

01:04:58.509 --> 01:05:01.592
- trapped in nightmare.
- You would let your friends die in here...

01:05:01.592 --> 01:05:03.309
to help them?

01:05:03.309 --> 01:05:05.742
There has to be another way.

01:05:05.742 --> 01:05:07.534
You've had your chance.

01:05:07.534 --> 01:05:10.492
Whatever happens now, is your fault.

01:05:11.675 --> 01:05:14.467
Elle?

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.250
Are you alright? Did she do anything to you ...

01:05:18.250 --> 01:05:22.709
- in the dream scape?
- No.

01:05:24.175 --> 01:05:27.467
No. I just want it
get her out of my head.

01:05:27.551 --> 01:05:29.009
When I get your life back.

01:05:29.209 --> 01:05:31.983
Well we  think we can lure her out into ...

01:05:31.983 --> 01:05:34.275
the open by using Charlotte as bait.

01:05:34.275 --> 01:05:37.034
You would do that for us?

01:05:38.459 --> 01:05:41.334
There's only a few hours left of the ash moon.

01:05:41.634 --> 01:05:44.426
If Emily and I want to move on,

01:05:44.826 --> 01:05:47.751
It's our only chance.

01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:05.716
There you are.

01:06:06.667 --> 01:06:08.134
You know it's impolite ...

01:06:08.134 --> 01:06:10.642
to cause your host so much trouble?

01:06:11.042 --> 01:06:14.734
I'm sure that
I'll find a way to repay you.

01:06:24.942 --> 01:06:26.192
A Trap.

01:06:26.492 --> 01:06:30.076
- You aren't serious?
- Vampire,

01:06:30.076 --> 01:06:31.951
warrior, journalist.

01:06:31.951 --> 01:06:35.309
I like our chances.
Let's have a chat about taking things ...

01:06:35.309 --> 01:06:37.767
that don't belong to us.

01:06:37.767 --> 01:06:40.209
You first.

01:06:40.209 --> 01:06:44.334
- Mel!
- Best get the broom out.

01:06:46.625 --> 01:06:50.800
Look at that. Then there were three.

01:06:53.900 --> 01:06:56.574
You should have taken up 
my offer, sweetheart.

01:06:56.574 --> 01:06:59.833
- Offer?
- Your life for your friends.

01:06:59.833 --> 01:07:01.875
Do not worry. Laura declined ...

01:07:01.875 --> 01:07:04.416
when she discovered Charlotte
and Emily can't move on ...

01:07:04.416 --> 01:07:08.341
without destroying your precious spark.

01:07:08.667 --> 01:07:09.818
You'll never be able to ...

01:07:09.818 --> 01:07:12.600
enjoy it. You'll spend the ...

01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:17.351
rest of your days looking 
over your shoulder ...

01:07:17.351 --> 01:07:20.517
wondering if its my step 
you hear at the door.

01:07:25.259 --> 01:07:27.334
I'll take my chances.

01:07:27.834 --> 01:07:29.459
I've got the brooch.

01:07:29.459 --> 01:07:31.192
There's nothing you can do to stop me.

01:07:31.192 --> 01:07:33.575
Maybe not, but she 
knows Krav Maga.

01:07:33.575 --> 01:07:37.450
What?

01:07:37.450 --> 01:07:40.200
Why do people 
always forget that?

01:07:47.976 --> 01:07:50.183
No.

01:07:55.084 --> 01:07:58.001
Hello.

01:08:00.301 --> 01:08:02.601
Carm?

01:08:03.301 --> 01:08:06.759
Carm.

01:08:19.399 --> 01:08:22.609
Pull yourself together, Hollis.

01:09:08.484 --> 01:09:11.091
Oh crap. We're alive?

01:09:11.091 --> 01:09:13.466
Today, Toronto News 9
it's harsh reality.

01:09:13.466 --> 01:09:16.466
Abandon your childhood 
dreams for the dubious security ...

01:09:16.466 --> 01:09:17.925
of a sub-par paycheck.

01:09:18.125 --> 01:09:21.225
Spend your days glorifying
clickbait and your nights ...

01:09:21.225 --> 01:09:22.809
letting fear and misery drive 
away friends and ...

01:09:22.809 --> 01:09:26.225
loved ones. Accept that life
is and unbroken chain of mediocrity,

01:09:26.225 --> 01:09:29.725
stretching on and on and on.

01:09:30.834 --> 01:09:33.876
Laura Hollis reporting live
from a failed career.

01:09:33.876 --> 01:09:36.475
I want my life, you little thief.

01:09:36.475 --> 01:09:38.859
I want my life!

01:09:40.759 --> 01:09:42.509
The doors are arbitrary.
Wonderful

01:09:42.559 --> 01:09:44.942
You are going to love New York. There's

01:09:44.942 --> 01:09:47.067
theater and concerts...

01:09:47.067 --> 01:09:48.559
and life.

01:09:48.859 --> 01:09:51.509
Wait, I know this. I dreamed this.

01:09:54.383 --> 01:09:56.309
What are you doing?

01:09:56.309 --> 01:10:00.183
You don't belong here.

01:10:09.042 --> 01:10:11.667
She laughed.

01:10:11.667 --> 01:10:14.917
Miss Sheridan she laughed ...

01:10:14.917 --> 01:10:16.625
at the very idea that ...

01:10:16.625 --> 01:10:20.750
- Oh God.
- Why did I trust her?

01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:21.875
Poor Emily.

01:10:21.875 --> 01:10:24.376
- Why did I not...
- Poor Charlotte.

01:10:24.876 --> 01:10:25.984
I was supposed to...

01:10:25.984 --> 01:10:27.184
keep you safe.

01:10:27.184 --> 01:10:30.134
Do you know what will 
happen if you die in here?

01:10:30.134 --> 01:10:31.550
Let me guess.

01:10:31.550 --> 01:10:33.967
- I die in the real world too.
- Worse.

01:10:33.967 --> 01:10:35.592
You will be trapped ...

01:10:35.592 --> 01:10:38.259
in this hell made for dead minds.

01:10:38.459 --> 01:10:40.718
I'm wonder ...

01:10:40.718 --> 01:10:45.175
- If you will feel so sympathetic then.
- Is that what happened to you?

01:10:45.189 --> 01:10:48.272
I don't want your pitty.
I want my life.

01:10:50.676 --> 01:10:53.301
I can take it from you living,

01:10:53.301 --> 01:10:55.634
or I can take it from you dead.

01:10:55.634 --> 01:10:57.659
You've seen my dreams.

01:10:58.259 --> 01:11:01.342
Have I ever fight gone down without a fight?

01:11:07.592 --> 01:11:09.951
I'm stuck in an endless loop 
of some one else's damage.

01:11:09.951 --> 01:11:14.134
- Classic me.
- You are going to love New York.

01:11:14.134 --> 01:11:16.283
There's
theater and concerts,

01:11:16.283 --> 01:11:18.334
and life.

01:11:19.534 --> 01:11:22.009
- Oh God. Carm!
- You're life is going to be ...

01:11:22.009 --> 01:11:24.118
so much bigger than you ever imagined.

01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:27.158
What are you doing?

01:11:37.900 --> 01:11:40.266
I met a woman in the village today.

01:11:40.767 --> 01:11:44.800
She said strange things about you.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
What's wrong?

01:11:51.151 --> 01:11:54.609
Why won't you look at me, Carmilla?

01:11:55.250 --> 01:11:59.459
Look at me!

01:12:03.176 --> 01:12:05.717
She was right.

01:12:07.367 --> 01:12:10.700
You're a monster.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.351
I can explain.

01:12:12.351 --> 01:12:14.725
I've heard enough of
your lies.

01:12:15.125 --> 01:12:17.192
Or your promises.

01:12:17.192 --> 01:12:18.525
all your talk ...

01:12:18.525 --> 01:12:21.083
- of a new life.
- No, not lies.

01:12:21.530 --> 01:12:23.998
In the colonies everything will be different.

01:12:23.998 --> 01:12:25.873
Nobody will know
us. You'll see...

01:12:25.873 --> 01:12:28.039
As if I would go anywhere ...

01:12:28.039 --> 01:12:30.123
with you now.

01:12:31.176 --> 01:12:32.992
No.

01:12:33.492 --> 01:12:35.467
My new friend ...

01:12:35.467 --> 01:12:39.676
is waiting in carriage, bellow.

01:12:39.676 --> 01:12:42.385
She's going to take me traveling.

01:12:42.626 --> 01:12:44.876
She will show me the wonders of the world.

01:12:44.876 --> 01:12:46.626
No, you can't go with her.

01:12:47.826 --> 01:12:50.350
Elle, I know I lied, but ...

01:12:50.350 --> 01:12:52.609
the horror she has planned 
for you is much worse than ...

01:12:52.609 --> 01:12:53.692
Worse?

01:12:54.692 --> 01:12:57.734
Worse than saying
that she loved me ...

01:12:57.734 --> 01:13:01.984
while she drank my blood?

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.583
While she drank my blood!

01:13:05.483 --> 01:13:08.316
Please.

01:13:11.326 --> 01:13:13.326
Don't worry.

01:13:14.426 --> 01:13:16.925
I've told her where you are.

01:13:16.942 --> 01:13:21.276
She will send someone to deal with you.

01:13:32.184 --> 01:13:35.501
What is this on repeat?

01:13:36.201 --> 01:13:40.909
How many times have you watched this?

01:13:41.334 --> 01:13:44.209
It's done. We leave tonight.

01:13:44.209 --> 01:13:48.167
In three days we will be on 
an ocean liner headed for New York.

01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:53.442
You are going to love New York.

01:13:53.442 --> 01:13:57.109
There's theater and concerts, ...

01:13:57.109 --> 01:13:59.026
and life.

01:13:59.709 --> 01:14:03.034
You're life is going to be 
so much bigger than you ever imagined.

01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:06.566
Hey, It's okay.

01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:09.392
You are not there anymore.

01:14:09.392 --> 01:14:12.934
You are here with me right now.

01:14:13.300 --> 01:14:15.283
And I have the brooch.

01:14:15.309 --> 01:14:18.601
If you can just absorb it.

01:14:24.209 --> 01:14:26.251
Nothing.

01:14:26.751 --> 01:14:28.000
Of course, not.

01:14:28.100 --> 01:14:30.267
Of course we still  
need some stupid spell.

01:14:30.267 --> 01:14:33.476
Maybe I should give her my life.

01:14:34.584 --> 01:14:36.583
What?

01:14:40.726 --> 01:14:41.900
Carm, you can't.

01:14:41.900 --> 01:14:44.651
- She's unhinged.
- Not to her,

01:14:45.151 --> 01:14:47.817
to them.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
Laura, everything you saw in there,

01:14:50.501 --> 01:14:54.542
it's everything I've been avoiding for years.

01:14:54.876 --> 01:14:57.584
Pretending like being human, ...

01:14:57.584 --> 01:14:59.417
meant I didn't ...

01:14:59.417 --> 01:15:02.584
do all of these awful things.

01:15:05.867 --> 01:15:08.284
How is it fair,
that I get this life while ...

01:15:08.284 --> 01:15:11.534
they are just trapped here?

01:15:12.334 --> 01:15:15.334
After everything I've done.

01:15:20.592 --> 01:15:22.634
Okay.

01:15:22.634 --> 01:15:23.801
A,

01:15:24.501 --> 01:15:26.700
let's acknowledge that Elle 
and your mother share  ...

01:15:26.700 --> 01:15:29.326
some of this blame. And B

01:15:29.626 --> 01:15:31.209
we will figure out another way a ...

01:15:31.209 --> 01:15:33.542
way that doesn't involve you giving up your life.

01:15:33.542 --> 01:15:38.209
You mean find a way,
to avoid responsibility.

01:15:38.209 --> 01:15:42.542
You heard Elle,

01:15:43.259 --> 01:15:45.175
there is no other way.

01:15:45.175 --> 01:15:46.892
It's my life for their freedom.

01:15:46.892 --> 01:15:49.767
And what about our life together?

01:15:49.767 --> 01:15:52.101
Our future?

01:15:54.418 --> 01:15:56.542
You just going to give up on that?

01:15:57.042 --> 01:15:59.542
- Laura, I'm not giving up ...
- We're supposed to have arguments ...

01:15:59.542 --> 01:16:02.759
over who does dishes 
and cupcakes ...

01:16:02.759 --> 01:16:06.783
to celebrate big days 
at work, and grandkids.

01:16:08.242 --> 01:16:10.242
What is that going to look like if you ...

01:16:10.242 --> 01:16:12.867
can live like you are 25 forever?

01:16:13.667 --> 01:16:17.792
You think that I don't 
want those things, too?

01:16:18.092 --> 01:16:21.134
Please don't give up
on our life.

01:16:21.234 --> 01:16:24.942
I'm not give up.

01:16:24.967 --> 01:16:28.875
But I can't keep running away.

01:16:29.775 --> 01:16:33.034
Not after what I've done.

01:16:34.626 --> 01:16:36.501
Okay.

01:16:46.442 --> 01:16:48.109
Thanks.

01:16:54.783 --> 01:16:58.183
Let's go save some ghosts.

01:17:11.734 --> 01:17:13.067
Seriously?

01:17:13.667 --> 01:17:16.334
People can't just dream 
about getting audited?

01:17:20.483 --> 01:17:21.775
Laf!

01:17:26.292 --> 01:17:28.509
- How did you...?
- Escape my personal hell?

01:17:28.709 --> 01:17:31.625
I've been through like three 
apocalypses, I could tell the difference.

01:17:31.625 --> 01:17:35.834
You found any of the the others?

01:17:35.834 --> 01:17:39.209
Funny you should mention that.

01:17:39.709 --> 01:17:41.859
I tried to wake her but 
she keeps mistaking me ...

01:17:41.859 --> 01:17:44.192
for me.

01:17:44.992 --> 01:17:48.200
Form 83-B done.

01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:49.967
Just filing 100 of these daily ...

01:17:49.967 --> 01:17:52.759
You don't mind taking
care of the deeds. Right?.

01:17:52.759 --> 01:17:54.600
It will just be like 5-6 million pages.

01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:58.518
You can do this alone. You don't
need me. See you in 6 years.

01:18:00.567 --> 01:18:02.067
Laura.

01:18:02.167 --> 01:18:04.251
What are you doing ...

01:18:04.751 --> 01:18:06.834
in my strangely bureaucratic nightmare?

01:18:06.834 --> 01:18:08.792
Elle zapped us into nightmare land.

01:18:08.792 --> 01:18:10.592
We have to do the
spell before sunrise ...

01:18:10.592 --> 01:18:12.634
which is coming up fast.

01:18:12.634 --> 01:18:15.375
I hid away the pages,
before Elle zapped me, but ...

01:18:15.375 --> 01:18:20.334
- without the code key to decipher the spell...
- I got the code key.

01:18:20.626 --> 01:18:24.576
Oh, yes the symbol! Do you have the whole thing?

01:18:24.576 --> 01:18:28.409
Yeah, I literally have a photographic memory.

01:18:28.409 --> 01:18:30.817
Oh I could just kiss you and ....

01:18:30.817 --> 01:18:33.567
your robot eye.

01:18:41.159 --> 01:18:42.434
You're safe.

01:18:46.009 --> 01:18:49.759
Why are people hunting me for sport?

01:18:51.042 --> 01:18:53.126
Mrs. Sheridan ...

01:18:53.126 --> 01:18:55.334
laughed at the very idea ...

01:19:15.967 --> 01:19:18.309
Okay, circle up. We don't need to...

01:19:18.309 --> 01:19:21.892
hold hands or anything, the spell
is much move powerful, but ...

01:19:21.892 --> 01:19:24.292
it might be more cosy that way.

01:19:24.292 --> 01:19:26.626
So what happens to us after the ghosts move on?

01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:31.734
We'll either find ourselves 
back at the schloss or ...

01:19:31.734 --> 01:19:34.725
- cease to exist entirely.
- It's better than our usual odds.

01:19:34.725 --> 01:19:37.959
I'm sorry. Not to criticize
any plan, which would clearly ...

01:19:37.959 --> 01:19:40.959
so much to our benefit,
but doesn't that mean ...

01:19:40.959 --> 01:19:43.334
you have to give up your human life?

01:19:44.601 --> 01:19:47.934
Yeah, well I'm responsible for what ...

01:19:47.934 --> 01:19:49.559
happened to you ...

01:19:49.559 --> 01:19:53.392
so this is how I can help.

01:19:58.109 --> 01:20:01.150
- Woah, what happened to the ...
- It's cake now.

01:20:01.150 --> 01:20:03.283
- Don't ask.
- Okay.

01:20:03.583 --> 01:20:09.251
All right, let's get this ritual 
started, before I change my mind.

01:20:25.018 --> 01:20:26.226
Carm!

01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:29.975
You think that I'm going to set you do this?

01:20:29.975 --> 01:20:32.200
Steal everything from me, again?

01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:34.559
But Carm really isn't the 
one who you blame for that.

01:20:34.559 --> 01:20:36.850
Is she? I've seen that moment,

01:20:36.850 --> 01:20:38.692
between you two over and over again.

01:20:39.192 --> 01:20:41.383
You had everything you ever wanted
and you gave it up because ...

01:20:41.383 --> 01:20:43.967
- you were afraid.
- They lied to me.

01:20:44.167 --> 01:20:45.534
Carmilla, her mother,

01:20:45.534 --> 01:20:47.200
they betrayed and murdered me.

01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:49.409
You're right, it isn't fair,
what happened to you,

01:20:49.409 --> 01:20:51.034
but that is not an excuse.

01:20:51.834 --> 01:20:53.775
Everything that you are doing right now,

01:20:53.775 --> 01:20:55.609
hurting everyone else, hurting
yourself it's just because ...

01:20:55.609 --> 01:20:58.192
you are afraid of what comes next,
but you don't have to be.

01:20:58.492 --> 01:21:00.618
We can help you. We
can help you find ...

01:21:00.618 --> 01:21:03.367
The peace that you've always been looking for. 

01:21:03.367 --> 01:21:07.100
No, I don't want your platitudes. I want my...

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:12.500
Your life. You want your life.

01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:14.542
Yeah, we know.

01:21:15.209 --> 01:21:18.092
But it's not all about you.
And you're a part of ...

01:21:18.092 --> 01:21:20.092
all this. Stay down.

01:21:20.792 --> 01:21:22.809
- Nice shot.
- I've been waiting to do that since ...

01:21:22.809 --> 01:21:25.142
we got here.

01:21:26.050 --> 01:21:29.234
So you kind of rockin' the 
fieldwork these days, huh?

01:21:29.734 --> 01:21:31.892
You think if we got some more admin help ...

01:21:31.892 --> 01:21:35.434
- you would be able to come out more?
- I think I could find some time ...

01:21:35.434 --> 01:21:38.183
to playing.

01:21:40.009 --> 01:21:43.467
We are almost free of all this.

01:21:43.709 --> 01:21:47.084
You shouldn't have been drawn into it to begin with.

01:21:47.100 --> 01:21:49.558
It was 1872.

01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:51.333
If we hadn't been 
killed by vampires,

01:21:51.333 --> 01:21:52.883
it would have been I don't know ...

01:21:52.883 --> 01:21:55.409
tuberculosis.

01:21:56.551 --> 01:21:59.834
Oddly specific.

01:21:59.850 --> 01:22:01.000
Each day was made better,

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:04.542
because you tried to make it such.

01:22:05.034 --> 01:22:07.909
I don't regret a thing.

01:22:12.009 --> 01:22:13.925
Thank you...

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:15.542
for the dance.

01:22:16.509 --> 01:22:19.300
I wish there could be another, but ...

01:22:19.300 --> 01:22:20.550
I get it.

01:22:20.550 --> 01:22:24.176
You gotta leave with 
the one the brung you.

01:22:24.817 --> 01:22:27.609
Would you like to?

01:22:28.267 --> 01:22:30.392
Obviously.

01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:47.584
Can we please just move on already?

01:23:08.342 --> 01:23:11.967
It's working.

01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:42.351
What the hell now?

01:23:44.342 --> 01:23:46.883
I guess with all
the ghosts gone,

01:23:46.883 --> 01:23:50.250
there is no reason for 
this place to exist anymore.

01:23:50.250 --> 01:23:52.234
So...

01:23:52.234 --> 01:23:54.026
It worked.

01:23:54.126 --> 01:23:56.292
Hooray.

01:24:00.234 --> 01:24:03.067
I'm sorry about before.

01:24:04.134 --> 01:24:06.984
I think I've been so focused
on chasing after your life because ...

01:24:06.984 --> 01:24:09.400
it seemed a lot easier than ...

01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:11.942
trying to fix my own.

01:24:11.942 --> 01:24:14.400
Hey,

01:24:14.850 --> 01:24:16.984
you're Laura Hollis.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.758
I have watched you fight vampires,

01:24:21.758 --> 01:24:25.250
and gods,

01:24:25.250 --> 01:24:29.140
even that lady who tried to put us 
in line at the craft fair.

01:24:32.525 --> 01:24:35.442
So you are going to figure it out.

01:24:35.442 --> 01:24:38.318
Whatever happens next,

01:24:39.392 --> 01:24:42.392
We are going to do it together.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.841
If this goes Romeo and Juliet on us,

01:24:51.859 --> 01:24:55.067
I'm totally going to haunt your ass.

01:24:55.234 --> 01:24:57.942
Of course you are.

01:25:21.409 --> 01:25:24.326
Well that was a kick.

01:25:27.867 --> 01:25:29.992
<i> Where are you guys? </ i></i>

01:25:29.992 --> 01:25:32.909
<i> And is everyone OK? Over. </ I></i>

01:25:33.792 --> 01:25:38.000
Affirmative. Laura
and Carm A OK.

01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:40.784
<i> - Over.
- Front door is unlocked. </ I></i>

01:25:40.784 --> 01:25:42.951
<i> Meet you outside. </ i></i>

01:25:42.951 --> 01:25:46.367
<i> - You are supposed to say over.
- Over. </ I></i>

01:25:47.417 --> 01:25:51.167
Let's get the hell out of stria.

01:26:11.018 --> 01:26:13.383
I call dibs on window.

01:26:45.742 --> 01:26:47.492
And how does it feel, Ms. Hollis,

01:26:47.492 --> 01:26:50.901
to officially be a freelance journalist at large?

01:26:50.901 --> 01:26:53.775
I have made a huge mistake.
What have I done?

01:26:53.775 --> 01:26:56.151
I quit my job. I gave up my cubicle.

01:26:56.151 --> 01:26:59.517
I don't have a plan. What
am I supposed to do without plan?

01:27:00.726 --> 01:27:03.142
Only about half of 
that was actual panic,

01:27:03.142 --> 01:27:05.600
- So pretty good right?
- Yeah.

01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:10.059
I'm just going to go get some blood, babe.

01:27:12.484 --> 01:27:15.418
- So  this is a blueprint?
- Yes, the ...

01:27:15.418 --> 01:27:18.042
blueprints they sent over 
and check this out.

01:27:18.042 --> 01:27:20.501
They have a industrial size 
cleaning closet.

01:27:20.501 --> 01:27:23.083
And I was thinking you could 
put your reactor over here,

01:27:23.083 --> 01:27:24.892
- in this corner.
- That is a beautiful thing.

01:27:24.892 --> 01:27:26.683
Selling out going smoothly?

01:27:26.683 --> 01:27:28.642
Were retaining executive control ...

01:27:28.642 --> 01:27:30.892
of Laferry at Intrigue. 
And they are giving us a ...

01:27:30.892 --> 01:27:34.059
thorium reactor. A thorium reactor.

01:27:34.059 --> 01:27:37.017
- It was really scary.
- It sounds a little cushy.

01:27:37.017 --> 01:27:38.809
It was a totally legit adventure.

01:27:38.809 --> 01:27:40.934
There were ghosts,
and a haunted mansion,

01:27:40.934 --> 01:27:43.001
and this weird nether world.

01:27:43.001 --> 01:27:44.709
And comfy beds, and midnight snacks,

01:27:44.709 --> 01:27:48.583
- and a masquerade ball.
- Look, I even have a mark where I ...

01:27:48.583 --> 01:27:50.334
got ghost zapped. Look.

01:27:50.334 --> 01:27:52.209
- No Seriously look.
- I see it. Its good.

01:27:55.542 --> 01:27:59.005
Ok don't give me pity eyes
Hollis. Like you never ...

01:27:59.030 --> 01:28:02.307
- had a crush on a dead girl.
- That does sound familiar.

01:28:05.618 --> 01:28:07.742
Thanks.

01:28:13.418 --> 01:28:15.084
So.

01:28:15.984 --> 01:28:18.342
Carmilla Karnstein ...

01:28:18.342 --> 01:28:20.767
a vampire again.

01:28:20.767 --> 01:28:22.018
What's next?

01:28:22.018 --> 01:28:27.309
I thinking, maybe my 
PHD in philosophy.

01:28:28.534 --> 01:28:31.101
Hey attend university for 70 odd years,

01:28:31.101 --> 01:28:33.734
you rack up a few credits.

01:28:33.734 --> 01:28:34.984
I'm so proud of you.

01:28:35.784 --> 01:28:40.909
You aren't worried about how
we will spend the rest of our lives together?

01:28:41.001 --> 01:28:43.834
I figure any two people
in a relationship ...

01:28:43.834 --> 01:28:46.334
our lives move at different paces.

01:28:46.434 --> 01:28:50.434
But that isn't the part that matters.

01:28:50.534 --> 01:28:52.642
This.

01:28:52.742 --> 01:28:54.651
Here.

01:28:54.651 --> 01:28:56.484
Right Now.

01:28:57.184 --> 01:28:59.967
This is what matters.

01:29:00.267 --> 01:29:02.892
And I love you.

01:29:03.883 --> 01:29:06.551
I love you too.

01:29:26.201 --> 01:29:27.667
I'm Laura Hollis,

01:29:27.667 --> 01:29:30.667
and this is a web exclusive 
for Creampuffington Post...

01:29:30.667 --> 01:29:33.000
We are talking today with veteran dragonslayer...

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:37.800
Elizabeth Spielsdorf about the great apocalypse of 2015.

01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:39.842
Hi, I'm Laura Hollis on assignment in Graz ...

01:29:39.842 --> 01:29:42.384
where we are just in time for 
the ribbon cutting ceremony on ...

01:29:42.384 --> 01:29:45.092
J.P. Armitage Memorial Library.

01:29:45.092 --> 01:29:46.842
Laura Hollis reporting to you live ...

01:29:46.842 --> 01:29:49.175
from the Geneva Summit on the rights of Werepeople.

01:29:49.175 --> 01:29:52.309
I'm Laura Hollis,
reporting to you live from Iceland where ...

01:29:52.309 --> 01:29:54.909
scientists have recently a breakthrough discovery ...

01:29:54.909 --> 01:29:57.283
of the the first drinkable fountain if youth.

01:29:57.283 --> 01:29:59.400
A scandal brewing tonight 
on the steps of the capital

01:29:59.400 --> 01:30:02.400
As the president who last month was revealed to be

01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:05.100
an as yet unidentified species of lizard creature

01:30:05.100 --> 01:30:06.700
with very small hands.

01:30:06.700 --> 01:30:10.300
Refuses to produce his long
form hatching certificate.

01:30:10.300 --> 01:30:16.100
This is Senior Corespondent 
Laura Hollis For MSSSNBCD

01:33:39.292 --> 01:33:42.209
Hey Mattie.

01:33:42.209 --> 01:33:43.834
Hey, sis.

01:33:43.834 --> 01:33:46.634
- Why are you...?
- Back from underworld and ...

01:33:46.634 --> 01:33:51.134
lounging in your charmingly
bohemian pied-à-terre.
