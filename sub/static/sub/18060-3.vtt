00:05.422 --> 00:07.883
<i>Of how she fell in love</i>

00:07.966 --> 00:09.760

No!

00:10.969 --> 00:12.846
<i>She was locked away in an asylum.</i>

00:12.930 --> 00:14.598
Alice. She needs help.

00:14.932 --> 00:17.809
<i>So the Knave of Hearts and I</i>
<i>brought her back to Wonderland</i>

00:17.893 --> 00:19.311
<i>to search for her true love.</i>

00:19.394 --> 00:20.896
He's here. I can feel it.

00:21.230 --> 00:23.232
<i>There are those who will try and stop her.</i>

00:23.315 --> 00:27.069
What we want can't be accomplished
until the girl's made all her wishes.

00:36.453 --> 00:38.539
That is a tale of heartbreak.

In my defense, I was tied to a tree
and stripped of my clothes,

03:33.046 --> 03:34.631
so that one wasn't really my fault.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.633
(SIGHS) These signs are everywhere.

03:36.717 --> 03:38.677
The Caterpillar must want you badly.

03:38.760 --> 03:41.180
"Wanted. With or without head."

03:41.263 --> 03:43.015
All right. We should split up.

03:44.016 --> 03:45.893
You don't need a thief,
much less a wanted thief,

03:45.976 --> 03:47.603
getting in the way
of you finding your genie.

03:47.686 --> 03:50.314
No. Somebody stole Cyrus' bottle.

03:50.397 --> 03:53.483
Who better to catch a thief
than someone who thinks like one?

03:54.776 --> 03:56.570
There was a compliment in there somewhere.

03:56.653 --> 04:00.199
Cyrus and I were the only two people
that knew where the bottle was buried.

04:00.282 --> 04:03.535
So I figure whoever dug it
out of the ground, either has Cyrus

04:03.619 --> 04:04.828
or knows who does.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.872
See? You don't need me.

04:06.955 --> 04:08.999
You got this all sorted on your own.

04:09.082 --> 04:11.376
It'd be one thing
if they left behind a clue,

04:11.460 --> 04:13.337
something to go on.

04:13.670 --> 04:16.131
But right now all we've got
is an empty hole in the ground.

04:17.090 --> 04:20.469
(SIGHS) If we'd got there a bit sooner,
we would have caught them in the act.

04:20.552 --> 04:22.679
-That's it.
-What's it?

04:22.763 --> 04:25.766
All we have to do is find out
who got there right before we did.

04:25.849 --> 04:28.769
I'd like nothing more, but unless
you've a way to go back in time...

04:28.852 --> 04:31.647
We don't have to go to the past, Alice.
We simply have to see it.

04:31.730 --> 04:33.232
Have you heard of the Forget Me Knot?

04:33.315 --> 04:34.399
The what?

04:34.483 --> 04:37.402
It's an incredibly valuable
enchanted piece of rope,

04:37.486 --> 04:40.280
that when tied together
at one end like a lasso,

04:40.364 --> 04:42.241
makes a sort of round picture frame.

04:43.575 --> 04:45.410
Wow, that is magic.

04:46.078 --> 04:48.413
The magic part comes
when you look through it.

04:49.164 --> 04:52.584
When you do, you can see the last thing
that happened at any particular place.

04:53.335 --> 04:55.671
So if we held it
above where Cyrus' bottle was buried...

04:55.754 --> 04:56.922
We should see who dug it up.

04:57.464 --> 04:58.882
Knave, that's brilliant.

04:58.966 --> 05:00.968
Where do we find
this terribly useful item?

05:01.635 --> 05:03.887
Yeah. That's gonna be the hard part.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.181
I don't care.

05:06.265 --> 05:07.975
I can handle whatever it is.

05:08.684 --> 05:10.394
I'm too close to finding him.

05:33.041 --> 05:34.376
What is this?

05:34.877 --> 05:35.878
Dinner.

05:35.961 --> 05:37.629
We thought you might like to join us.

05:37.963 --> 05:39.339
I'd rather starve.

05:39.423 --> 05:40.799
Are you sure?

05:41.383 --> 05:44.219
But you haven't seen the centerpiece yet.

05:45.637 --> 05:47.306
I made it

05:47.389 --> 05:50.642
out of a cheap bit of magic I found
flitting around the hall.

05:52.811 --> 05:53.937
Your message to Alice.

05:55.564 --> 05:57.399
It seems she wrote back.

06:00.027 --> 06:01.320
"I'm coming for you."

06:02.863 --> 06:04.239
That's right, genie.

06:04.364 --> 06:06.241
She didn't heed your warning.

06:08.160 --> 06:09.912
You don't seem in a festive mood.

06:10.287 --> 06:12.206
Perhaps the centerpiece was a bit much.

06:12.623 --> 06:13.707
Hmm.

06:13.790 --> 06:16.001
You should know better than anyone,

06:16.084 --> 06:18.795
-magic always comes with a price.
-So does stealing it.

06:18.879 --> 06:21.465
I'm not going to steal your magic, genie.

06:21.965 --> 06:24.384
I'm simply three wishes away
from owning it.

06:24.593 --> 06:27.596
-She'll never make them.
-Just like she'll never come back for you.

06:27.679 --> 06:29.431
Oh, Alice is stronger than you think.

06:29.848 --> 06:31.308
Well, we're about to find out.

06:31.934 --> 06:34.394
Jafar, you should really bathe
your prisoners from time to time.

06:34.478 --> 06:36.230

06:36.313 --> 06:38.440

06:38.524 --> 06:39.775
Just for a while.

06:40.484 --> 06:43.445

the look on his pathetic face today

Yes.

07:02.798 --> 07:04.424
No, Cyrus, no.

07:05.092 --> 07:06.218
The proper question is,

07:06.510 --> 07:08.762
what are you going to do to her?

07:11.849 --> 07:13.725
The Caterpillar has a Forget Me Knot.

07:13.809 --> 07:15.853
That's not a solution.
That's another problem.

07:16.311 --> 07:17.646
It'll be okay.

07:17.980 --> 07:20.524

He likes to make deals,
and I have a deal for him.

07:27.990 --> 07:30.617
You think he'll take it
and not just kill you on sight?

07:30.784 --> 07:32.494
There's always an element of risk.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.164
You're willing to do this for me?

07:36.582 --> 07:39.668
Don't get all mushy, Alice.
I'm doing this for me.

07:40.127 --> 07:41.670
This thief's gonna clear his name.

07:43.213 --> 07:44.715

I'll be able to pay everything back
and then double.

Only a few people have seen him

What would a creature like that
want with a Forget Me Knot?

I suppose he wants it for the same reason
the Caterpillar does, Alice.

11:41.118 --> 11:43.871
even more powerful,
and therefore, even more cruel?

11:44.329 --> 11:45.706
Looks to be the size of it.

11:46.415 --> 11:49.084
There must be a way
to get what we want without just

11:49.168 --> 11:50.586
putting our troubles onto others.

11:50.669 --> 11:53.380
What if I was to tell you
you could be with Cyrus forever,

11:53.463 --> 11:55.424
but somebody else
had to suffer because of it?

11:55.507 --> 11:56.508
Would you do it?

11:59.094 --> 12:00.137
Well, that's not an option...

12:00.220 --> 12:02.681
Maybe it's not an option today,
but it could be tomorrow.

12:02.764 --> 12:04.308
How much is he worth to you, Alice?

12:04.641 --> 12:06.643
Don't forget what we're doing here.
It's thieving.

12:07.186 --> 12:09.188
-Yes, I'm getting that.
-Yeah.

12:09.271 --> 12:11.190
You wanted a thief. Well, you got one.

12:12.900 --> 12:14.902
Will? Will Scarlet?

12:14.985 --> 12:16.320
Give me your hand.

12:16.695 --> 12:17.946
You worried I pinched something?

12:18.030 --> 12:19.907
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY) Not at all.

12:21.241 --> 12:22.242
(GROANS)

12:25.037 --> 12:26.121
You're one of us now.

12:29.249 --> 12:30.250
For life.

12:30.584 --> 12:31.585
A thief for life?

12:31.752 --> 12:33.670
No. Not a thief.

12:34.505 --> 12:36.048
People call us that.

12:36.757 --> 12:38.842
-That's not what we are.
-Then what are we?

12:39.051 --> 12:40.677
We help those in need.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.013
A thief only steals for himself.

12:43.430 --> 12:45.432
Right. And that's not us?

12:45.891 --> 12:49.770
We have a cause that's bigger than
any one of our own needs.

12:49.853 --> 12:51.396
And that cause is humanity.

12:52.147 --> 12:55.734
When you steal for personal gain,
the first thing you lose is yourself.

12:57.402 --> 12:58.403
Rest up, Will.

12:59.154 --> 13:01.073
We leave these woods at dawn.

13:02.366 --> 13:03.659
Actually,

13:03.742 --> 13:05.410
I wanted to speak to you about that.

13:06.245 --> 13:08.497
It might be worth hanging around
for a few more days.

13:08.580 --> 13:10.666
What for? We've swept the area clean.

13:10.749 --> 13:14.503
Not completely. There's a place that sits
on top of the forbidden mountain.

13:14.586 --> 13:15.629
No.

13:15.712 --> 13:17.047
That is Maleficent's castle.

13:17.297 --> 13:18.340
Yes, I'm aware.

13:18.590 --> 13:20.217
She's a sorceress, Will.

13:20.676 --> 13:23.095
The one thing
we do not mess about with is magic.

13:23.512 --> 13:25.556
It's dangerous.
No matter how valuable it is,

13:25.639 --> 13:27.516
or how much wealth it can bring you,

13:27.599 --> 13:28.892
it's never worth the consequences.

13:28.976 --> 13:30.811
Which is why
we walk right past all that stuff

13:30.894 --> 13:31.895
and go for the gold.

13:32.271 --> 13:35.732
There's a chest that she keeps hidden
in the walls, somewhere in the main hall.

13:35.816 --> 13:39.069
Word is there's a lot of gold inside
to care for the people of this village

13:39.152 --> 13:40.821
and the next, for years to come.

13:42.489 --> 13:43.824
Isn't that the point of all this?

13:44.449 --> 13:45.492
Helping humanity?

13:45.909 --> 13:48.871
I've got a plan, but it'll take eight men
to get past the guards.

13:48.954 --> 13:51.790
She's away from the castle
and not expected back for several days.

13:51.874 --> 13:54.459
We make our approach at nightfall,
return here with the gold,

13:54.543 --> 13:56.545
and only the gold, well before dawn.

13:59.173 --> 14:01.633
You'd steal the pitchfork
from the devil himself.

14:01.884 --> 14:04.178
And be out of hell
before he realized it was gone.

14:07.681 --> 14:09.266
All right then.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.101
The gold. Nothing else.

14:11.185 --> 14:13.312
I wouldn't think of it. I'm no thief.

14:36.710 --> 14:37.753
Don't wake up.

14:39.880 --> 14:41.673
It's only me, luv. It's only me.

14:43.884 --> 14:44.927
I'm in.

14:45.636 --> 14:47.262
The newest Merry Man.

14:48.472 --> 14:49.723
They bought it.

14:49.890 --> 14:53.810
They think me a believer of their cause,
and now their cause is ours.

14:53.894 --> 14:55.145
-WOMAN: Really?
-Really.

14:56.271 --> 14:58.273
Tomorrow at sundown we rob that castle.

14:58.732 --> 15:01.693
Soon you and I will have everything
we need to get out of this place.

15:02.069 --> 15:03.612
A new life awaits us.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.790
JAFAR: Alice is a brave girl.

15:15.123 --> 15:16.500
That much is clear.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.794
So the question we have to answer is,

15:18.877 --> 15:21.255
what will force her
to make her first wish?

15:22.047 --> 15:23.757
Do you honestly think
that I will tell you?

15:23.841 --> 15:27.886
If I honestly thought you knew,
you'd have no choice but to tell me.

15:30.264 --> 15:32.266
I think I found something.

15:34.434 --> 15:35.727
The Mome Rath.

15:35.811 --> 15:37.604
Its mouth is so filled with fangs,

15:37.688 --> 15:40.732
it's like being pressed together
between two beds of nails.

15:41.567 --> 15:43.694
We don't want to kill her, Your Majesty.

15:44.069 --> 15:45.612
Not until we're done with her.

15:45.696 --> 15:47.489
Jafar, I know this girl.

15:48.323 --> 15:49.575
Fear.

15:49.658 --> 15:53.704
Fear of losing her Cyrus
is the only thing that will make her wish.

15:54.413 --> 15:55.455
Go on.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.334
Ah, yes. The Sarlacc.

15:59.793 --> 16:03.463
This will digest her over a millennia.
Plenty of time to make a wish.

16:03.547 --> 16:04.631
Keep going.

16:06.466 --> 16:07.509
Here's one.

16:07.885 --> 16:09.803
Something she faced here
when she was a child,

16:09.887 --> 16:11.638
something that almost killed her.

16:11.972 --> 16:14.308
And according to my large-eared friend,

16:14.391 --> 16:17.060
is the source of endless nightmares.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.021
The Bandersnatch.

16:20.105 --> 16:22.774
That's it. That's the one.

16:22.858 --> 16:24.109
Are you certain?

16:24.568 --> 16:25.652
Look at him.

16:26.445 --> 16:28.530
Do you see the concern on his face?

16:31.408 --> 16:33.285
The Bandersnatch it is.

16:34.620 --> 16:36.663
Thank you for your assistance, genie.

16:43.921 --> 16:45.631
ALICE: Do you think
the Grendel's in there?

16:45.714 --> 16:49.134
WILL: Doesn't matter. We don't have
a choice. We're going in there either way.

16:51.929 --> 16:53.639
You gonna challenge him to a duel?

16:56.225 --> 16:58.185
I've fought monsters before. Have you?

16:58.393 --> 16:59.728
I've stolen from them.

16:59.811 --> 17:01.688
And what my experience has taught me is,

17:01.772 --> 17:03.607
the only thing
better than defeating a monster

17:03.690 --> 17:05.609
is never having to fight one
in the first place.

17:05.692 --> 17:07.945
Well, how do you propose
we get the knot from him then?

17:08.362 --> 17:11.782
Simple. I'll create a diversion.
Once I've drawn the Grendel out,

17:11.865 --> 17:14.034
you go inside, grab the knot, and run.

17:14.117 --> 17:17.454
If we lose each other, meet at Greener
Pastures where the bottle was buried.

17:19.998 --> 17:21.708
That plan is actually quite sound.

17:22.835 --> 17:23.919
You really are a thief.

17:24.336 --> 17:25.796
Aye. Follow me.

17:26.255 --> 17:27.506
The trick is poise.

17:27.589 --> 17:30.300
Keep your cool, and always stay
one step ahead of your mark.

18:06.295 --> 18:07.421
Where are we?

18:07.921 --> 18:09.548
I think we're in his house.

18:10.048 --> 18:11.884
Actually, I think we're in his kitchen.

18:17.181 --> 18:18.307
Excuse me, sir?

There has to be another way out of this.
(SIGHS)

18:40.204 --> 18:43.081
The only way out
seems to be through his digestive tract.

18:44.333 --> 18:46.668
(GASPS) You said you were
such a great thief.

18:46.752 --> 18:48.837
Maybe it's time you show what you can do.

19:06.605 --> 19:09.525
Maleficent traffics
in the darkest of magic.

19:10.108 --> 19:12.069

19:12.152 --> 19:14.696

and one thing only, the gold.

behind a wall panel.

quite a bit smaller than the rest.

20:23.140 --> 20:24.766
I think he's talking to someone.

20:24.850 --> 20:25.851
Brilliant!

20:26.351 --> 20:28.270
Because one bloody monster isn't enough.

20:29.354 --> 20:30.856
What's for dinner?

20:35.903 --> 20:38.906
He's alone.
The crazy bloke's talking to himself.

20:39.198 --> 20:41.325

20:45.913 --> 20:46.955
Well, hello.

20:47.039 --> 20:50.167
-What is it?
-The knot. It's right there.

What did he do to those poor people?

21:28.539 --> 21:31.416
(LAUGHS) Hmm.

21:32.125 --> 21:33.836
I don't think he did anything to them.

21:34.837 --> 21:35.879
What?

21:36.421 --> 21:37.631
Alice,

21:37.714 --> 21:41.051
I think there may be a way for us
to get everything we want today.

21:44.513 --> 21:46.890
The Bandersnatch is a unique creature.

21:46.974 --> 21:50.602

it won't stop until it has it.

have something in common.

21:53.689 --> 21:56.358

22:06.034 --> 22:08.036
there is something else.

22:10.330 --> 22:12.749
There's a queen.
That's all you need to know.

-No.

25:52.553 --> 25:54.805
My instructions were clear!

25:55.681 --> 25:57.891
Who among you disobeyed me?

26:00.686 --> 26:02.396
Who took this other treasure?

26:10.237 --> 26:12.197
He's out chopping wood.
He'll be back any second.

26:12.406 --> 26:13.574
Don't panic.

26:13.657 --> 26:16.201
I've been in worse binds than this.

26:18.912 --> 26:20.372
Well, equivalent binds.

26:22.249 --> 26:24.126
So who's that woman,
the one you had to forget?

26:24.626 --> 26:27.045
Really? We're about to be eaten alive.

26:27.129 --> 26:28.130
Was it Anastasia?

26:28.213 --> 26:30.090
I mean this as a friend, Alice. Sod off!

26:31.091 --> 26:33.427
Now, if you give me a second,
I'm almost...

26:33.510 --> 26:36.054
Free. (EXHALES)

How the bloody hell did you do that?

26:38.432 --> 26:40.434

that kept telling me to use a wish.

26:40.517 --> 26:42.269
Oh, Alice, you didn't.

-What a bloody waste. It's just rope!
-Oh, relax.

26:45.230 --> 26:46.690
Their sharp corners come in handy.

26:46.857 --> 26:48.442
There's more than one way to use a wish.

Hurry.

27:00.621 --> 27:01.622
What are you doing?

27:01.705 --> 27:03.624
-I ain't leaving without that knot.
-Will.

27:03.999 --> 27:06.335
I made the deal with the Caterpillar.
It's my head on the line.

27:06.418 --> 27:08.629
It'll be both our heads

28:55.777 --> 28:58.572
She's dead, which means so is he.

28:58.655 --> 29:01.700
Which also means
Alice used her first wish.

29:01.783 --> 29:02.826
She didn't.

29:03.619 --> 29:04.620
Are you certain?

29:04.703 --> 29:05.871
I would know.

29:05.954 --> 29:07.998
But Cyrus indicated
that was the perfect beast.

that thing would fall for your trap?

29:30.270 --> 29:32.898
It was Cyrus. That's how I did it.

29:33.232 --> 29:34.233
What now?

29:34.316 --> 29:36.068
I didn't see him here getting attacked.

29:36.151 --> 29:37.736
Bandersnatches are deadly.

29:37.819 --> 29:40.781
But they're also dumb, and have
terrible eyesight. He taught me that.

29:41.114 --> 29:42.115
Charming.

29:42.199 --> 29:45.077
I told him how they scared me
when I came to Wonderland as a child,

29:45.160 --> 29:46.954
so he taught me all about them.

29:47.037 --> 29:48.247
"Know who you're up against."

29:52.334 --> 29:53.877

She's gone.

30:13.480 --> 30:14.565
Who was she?

30:16.191 --> 30:17.192
My wife.

30:18.443 --> 30:19.945
I lost her long ago.

30:22.322 --> 30:23.323
I'm sorry.

30:24.408 --> 30:26.743
I thought I would die of heartbreak.

owned by the Red Queen.

30:42.676 --> 30:44.928
I saw my wife alive again.

she turned me into this. (SNIFFLES)

Yes.

30:57.733 --> 30:59.151
But I had no choice.

30:59.484 --> 31:01.987
You did what you had to do
to be with the woman you loved.

31:02.529 --> 31:03.530
There's no crime in that.

31:04.323 --> 31:06.241
The only crime is what she did to you.

31:09.119 --> 31:10.120
Take it.

31:10.871 --> 31:13.081
It holds no value for me now.

Thank you.

31:15.876 --> 31:18.128
I hope it brings you what you desire.

31:41.735 --> 31:42.861
You sold us out, Will.

31:42.945 --> 31:45.989
-I was just getting fresh supplies.
-Don't even try. I know you did.

31:46.073 --> 31:47.407
What I don't know is why.

31:48.534 --> 31:50.410
What was so important
you'd go after magic?

31:51.119 --> 31:52.704
Was it debts? A sick parent?

31:52.871 --> 31:53.872
A woman?

31:56.166 --> 31:58.418
-It was a woman, wasn't it?
-I've got my reasons.

31:58.502 --> 32:00.504
Well, whatever they are,
they're not good enough.

32:02.714 --> 32:03.882
and it will haunt you.

What are you going to do to me?

32:05.300 --> 32:06.385
Worst thing possible.

32:07.094 --> 32:08.095
Nothing.

32:09.304 --> 32:10.305
You're gonna let me go?

32:10.514 --> 32:11.515
Yes.

32:12.391 --> 32:14.268
You will meet the fate you've earned.

32:15.269 --> 32:16.353
Fate you deserve.

That's rich, coming from
the prince of thieves himself!

Today you've shown yourself
to be the only thief among us.

32:26.029 --> 32:28.824
Because I'm stealing for meself
and not living by your code?

32:29.324 --> 32:32.786
Well, I've gotten along just fine

Bandersnatch attacked.

33:14.536 --> 33:15.662
Did you kill it?

33:17.080 --> 33:18.081
No.

Who did?

33:21.752 --> 33:23.337
I had guests.

More than one?

33:31.428 --> 33:32.429
Tell us who.

33:34.515 --> 33:36.099
Tell us who, and we can help you.

33:44.358 --> 33:45.359
Perhaps.

33:52.157 --> 33:53.867
But that is impossible.

the impossible will be possible.

I'm a thief. Playing parts is what I do.

34:58.473 --> 35:01.435
I don't think you were playing a part.
You were identifying with him.

-Ah, bollocks.
-Is it?

I want you to tell me

Everything.

37:11.148 --> 37:12.149
The Rabbit,

37:12.900 --> 37:15.694

capable of betraying me.

Everything we've said,
everything we've done,

37:22.409 --> 37:23.827
Probably a safe bet.

37:24.620 --> 37:26.914
After we settle matters
with the Caterpillar,

37:27.331 --> 37:28.957
it's time to pay her a visit.

What do you mean?

37:44.515 --> 37:47.768

37:54.691 --> 37:57.069
you'll spend your remaining days
as a desk ornament.

That thing is your key to freedom,

38:00.989 --> 38:03.116
for you to no longer be a hunted thief.

38:03.992 --> 38:04.993
Actually,

38:05.494 --> 38:07.120
being a thief ain't up to anyone but me.

38:07.871 --> 38:10.999
If I give this to him,
then I went to steal this thing for me.

38:11.875 --> 38:13.669
That makes me a thief.

38:13.752 --> 38:15.254
But if I don't give it to him,

38:16.380 --> 38:17.798
well, then I got it for you.

39:49.097 --> 39:50.682
There's only one way to find out.

39:58.148 --> 40:02.611
(EXCLAIMS, SIGHS)

40:05.447 --> 40:06.448
Ready?

40:07.574 --> 40:09.284
As long as I'm with you,

40:10.285 --> 40:12.037
I'm ready for anything. (LAUGHS)

40:12.996 --> 40:14.414
I love you, Anastasia.

40:15.707 --> 40:17.417
And I love you, Will Scarlet.

40:27.261 --> 40:29.805
Now, what is this new world
it will take us to?

40:31.098 --> 40:33.892
A place filled with magic

40:34.601 --> 40:37.062
and wonders beyond all imagination.

40:38.105 --> 40:39.773
Where anything is possible.

40:40.440 --> 40:43.277
Where we can be whoever we want to be.

40:43.819 --> 40:45.112
Sounds lovely.

40:45.612 --> 40:46.613
What's it called?

40:47.614 --> 40:48.615
(SOFTLY) Wonderland.

40:53.287 --> 40:54.288
Right, then.

40:54.371 --> 40:56.164
Next stop, Wonderland.
