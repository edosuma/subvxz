13:01.822 --> 13:03.366
TO ARRANGE

13:01.822 --> 13:03.366
THE BURIAL PLOT?

13:03.408 --> 13:04.367
YEAH.

13:04.409 --> 13:06.160
HE SHOULD HAVE

13:04.409 --> 13:06.160
A CASKET,

13:06.202 --> 13:07.328
YOU KNOW,

13:06.202 --> 13:07.328
MAHOGANY, MAYBE.

13:07.370 --> 13:08.996
ONLY THE BEST

13:07.370 --> 13:08.996
FOR MR. P.

13:09.038 --> 13:10.498
YOU KNOW WHAT?

13:10.540 --> 13:12.333
I THINK WE SHOULD MOVE THE

13:10.540 --> 13:12.333
V.I.P. RECEPTION TO EAST ONE.

13:12.375 --> 13:13.668
THE ANISH KAPUR IS IN THERE.

13:13.710 --> 13:15.295
IT'S ALWAYS GOOD

13:13.710 --> 13:15.295
TO IMBUE YOUR MAJOR DONORS

13:15.336 --> 13:16.546
WITH A SENSE OF AWE.

13:16.588 --> 13:18.298
BUT THE ISABELLA PERNAO'S

13:16.588 --> 13:18.298
THERE, TOO.

13:18.339 --> 13:19.382
DON'T YOU THINK--

13:19.424 --> 13:20.759
I THINK

13:19.424 --> 13:20.759
IT SAYS RIGHT OUT OF THE GATE,

13:20.799 --> 13:22.594
"WE STAND BEHIND THIS SHOW,

13:20.799 --> 13:22.594
EVERY FACET OF IT,

13:22.636 --> 13:25.263
"AND WE'RE NOT ABOUT TO HIDE

13:22.636 --> 13:25.263
THE MORE CHALLENGING PIECES

13:25.305 --> 13:27.140
FOR ANYBODY'S COMFORT."

13:27.181 --> 13:28.725
YOU KNOW, I STILL NEED

13:27.181 --> 13:28.725
TO DISCUSS SECURITY.

13:28.767 --> 13:30.268
CAN YOU MAKE SURE

13:28.767 --> 13:30.268
THAT GAVIN DOESN'T LEAVE

13:30.310 --> 13:31.728
BEFORE I'VE HAD A CHANCE

13:30.310 --> 13:31.728
TO TALK WITH HIM?

13:31.770 --> 13:32.979
I'LL LET THE CATERERS

13:31.770 --> 13:32.979
KNOW ABOUT THE...

13:33.020 --> 13:33.980
GREAT.

13:34.021 --> 13:35.189
HEY, BIG JAMES.

13:35.231 --> 13:37.233
HOLA,  SISTER.

13:37.275 --> 13:38.234
HELLO.

13:38.276 --> 13:39.319
YOU REMEMBER

13:38.276 --> 13:39.319
YOU SAID

13:39.360 --> 13:41.028
HOW IMPORTANT

13:39.360 --> 13:41.028
IT WAS TO EAT?

13:41.070 --> 13:42.196
WELL, WE PICKED UP

13:41.070 --> 13:42.196
A LITTLE SOMETHING

13:42.238 --> 13:43.197
FROM

13:42.238 --> 13:43.197
THAT WOO-WOO PLACE

13:43.239 --> 13:44.324
ON LA CIENEGA

13:44.365 --> 13:45.450
THAT YOU LOVE

13:44.365 --> 13:45.450
SO MUCH.

13:45.492 --> 13:46.493
YOU GUYS, YOU WENT

13:45.492 --> 13:46.493
TO  REAL FOOD DAILY.

13:46.534 --> 13:47.619
THAT IS SO SWEET.

13:47.661 --> 13:48.911
WELL, IVAN

13:47.661 --> 13:48.911
PICKED IT UP

13:48.953 --> 13:50.580
WHILE I WAS

13:48.953 --> 13:50.580
AT MY A.A. MEETING.

13:50.622 --> 13:51.623
OH, THANK YOU.

13:51.665 --> 13:53.583
THANK YOU SO MUCH

13:53.625 --> 13:56.336
FOR COMING.

13:56.377 --> 13:58.338
UM, I GUESS

13:56.377 --> 13:58.338
YOU KNOW

13:58.379 --> 14:01.675
WHAT I WANT

13:58.379 --> 14:01.675
TO TALK ABOUT.

14:01.716 --> 14:04.594
NO, I'M--I'M NOT SURE.

14:04.636 --> 14:05.804
WELL,

14:04.636 --> 14:05.804
AS YOU CAN SEE,

14:05.844 --> 14:08.348
WE'RE TRYING TO

14:05.844 --> 14:08.348
FIX THIS PLACE UP,

14:08.389 --> 14:11.309
AND WE NEED HELP.

14:11.351 --> 14:13.144
WE DON'T HAVE

14:11.351 --> 14:13.144
A LOT OF MONEY,

14:13.186 --> 14:14.145
BUT IT'S

14:14.187 --> 14:15.229
A REALLY GREAT

14:14.187 --> 14:15.229
PROJECT,

14:15.271 --> 14:16.939
AND THE KIDS,

14:16.981 --> 14:20.318
THEY JUST--

14:16.981 --> 14:20.318
THEY LOVE IT HERE.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.987
UH...YEAH.

14:23.029 --> 14:24.447
ANYTHING FOR THE KIDS.

14:24.489 --> 14:27.408
CAN I TALK TO YOU

14:24.489 --> 14:27.408
FOR A SECOND?

14:27.450 --> 14:29.202
YOU WANT TO TELL ME

14:27.450 --> 14:29.202
WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

14:29.243 --> 14:30.495
I'M JUST TAKING OUT THE TRASH.

14:30.537 --> 14:31.871
NO, WITH HER.

14:31.912 --> 14:33.623
SHE'S MADLY IN LOVE

14:31.912 --> 14:33.623
WITH YOU, YOU KNOW.

14:33.665 --> 14:35.249
NO, HE'S NOT, WE'RE FRIENDS.

14:35.291 --> 14:36.584
HE HELPS ME OUT

14:35.291 --> 14:36.584
WITH STUFF.

14:36.626 --> 14:38.837
THAT'S BECAUSE

14:36.626 --> 14:38.837
SHE IS IN LOVE WITH YOU,

14:38.878 --> 14:40.296
AND SHE WANTS TO BE

14:38.878 --> 14:40.296
YOUR HUSBAND.

14:40.338 --> 14:41.381
NO, IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

14:41.422 --> 14:42.590
KIT, BELIEVE ME.

14:42.632 --> 14:43.883
YOU MIGHT NOT BE ABLE

14:42.632 --> 14:43.883
TO READ THE SIGNALS,

14:43.924 --> 14:44.884
BUT THEY'RE THERE.

14:44.925 --> 14:46.344
I SAW THE WAY

14:44.925 --> 14:46.344
SHE LOOKS AT YOU.

14:46.386 --> 14:47.554
SHE IS FULLY COURTING YOU,

14:46.386 --> 14:47.554
OLD SCHOOL,

14:47.595 --> 14:48.555
AND YOU'RE LETTING HER.

14:48.596 --> 14:49.723
OH, IS THAT SO?

14:49.764 --> 14:50.973
YEAH, IT IS.

14:51.015 --> 14:52.308
WELL, THANK YOU

14:51.015 --> 14:52.308
FOR THE LESSONS

14:52.350 --> 14:54.686
ON THE RITUAL MATING HABITS

14:52.350 --> 14:54.686
OF INDIGENOUS LESBIANS.

14:54.728 --> 14:57.689
MAYBE NEXT WEEK, WE'LL DO

14:54.728 --> 14:57.689
BUTCH AND FEMME ROLE PLAYING.

14:57.731 --> 14:58.815
UH, LADIES.

15:00.692 --> 15:01.984
I FIGURED

15:00.692 --> 15:01.984
WE SHOULD GET GOING

15:02.026 --> 15:03.778
AND LET YOU GET ON

15:02.026 --> 15:03.778
WITH YOUR BUSINESS.

15:03.820 --> 15:04.904
YOU MUST WANT

15:03.820 --> 15:04.904
TO GET HOME

15:04.945 --> 15:05.905
TO THE LITTLE WOMAN

15:05.946 --> 15:07.741
SOME TIME TONIGHT.

15:23.840 --> 15:26.467
GOSH, GENE.

15:26.509 --> 15:30.263
THIS IS SO MUCH BETTER

15:26.509 --> 15:30.263
THAN DINNER AND A MOVIE.

15:30.304 --> 15:33.683
IS THIS HOW YOU GET

15:30.304 --> 15:33.683
ALL THE GIRLS?

15:33.725 --> 15:34.684
TRUTH?

15:34.726 --> 15:36.853
YES, PLEASE.

15:36.895 --> 15:39.814
I DON'T REALLY DATE

15:36.895 --> 15:39.814
THAT MUCH,

15:39.856 --> 15:41.190
YOU KNOW...

15:41.232 --> 15:42.191
WHY?

15:42.233 --> 15:45.278
UM...I WAS

15:42.233 --> 15:45.278
WITH THE SAME WOMAN

15:45.319 --> 15:46.654
FOR THE LAST

15:45.319 --> 15:46.654
FIVE YEARS,

15:46.696 --> 15:50.074
AND SHE NEVER

15:46.696 --> 15:50.074
REALLY CAME HERE.

15:50.116 --> 15:52.159
I MEAN,

15:50.116 --> 15:52.159
SHE HATED FISH.

15:52.201 --> 15:53.202
SO...

15:53.244 --> 15:54.245
OH.

15:54.287 --> 15:55.496
I KNOW.

15:55.538 --> 15:57.290
WE WEREN'T EXACTLY

15:55.538 --> 15:57.290
THE GREATEST MATCH.

15:57.331 --> 15:59.333
WHAT ELSE?

15:59.375 --> 16:01.669
UM...

16:01.711 --> 16:03.922
WELL, SHE LIKED

16:01.711 --> 16:03.922
TO EXERCISE

16:03.963 --> 16:05.298
EARLY, EARLY

16:03.963 --> 16:05.298
IN THE MORNING,

16:05.339 --> 16:06.257
AND...

16:06.299 --> 16:07.300
NO.

16:07.341 --> 16:09.260
I HATE EXERCISE,

16:07.341 --> 16:09.260
AND I HATE MORNINGS,

16:09.302 --> 16:11.888
SO...

16:11.930 --> 16:13.180
AND I DID MY THESIS

16:13.222 --> 16:15.182
ON NOCTURNAL

16:13.222 --> 16:15.182
BEHAVIOR.

16:15.224 --> 16:16.893
I NEVER REALLY

16:15.224 --> 16:16.893
BROKE THE HABIT

16:16.935 --> 16:18.895
OF STAYING UP LATE,

16:18.937 --> 16:19.896
YOU KNOW?

16:19.938 --> 16:21.063
WHAT DO YOU LIKE

16:19.938 --> 16:21.063
TO DO

16:21.105 --> 16:22.857
IN THE MIDDLE

16:21.105 --> 16:22.857
OF THE NIGHT?

16:24.400 --> 16:26.653
USUALLY, I READ...

16:26.694 --> 16:28.446
HMM.

16:30.406 --> 16:32.199
AND...

16:32.241 --> 16:34.076
SHE WASN'T JEWISH.

16:36.162 --> 16:37.747
OH, GENE,

16:37.789 --> 16:40.249
IS THAT IMPORTANT

16:37.789 --> 16:40.249
TO YOU?

16:40.291 --> 16:41.375
NO.

16:41.417 --> 16:42.502
NO, IT'S NOT

16:41.417 --> 16:42.502
IMPORTANT.

16:42.543 --> 16:44.253
IT'S...

16:47.340 --> 16:49.258
IT'S JUST

16:47.340 --> 16:49.258
AN ADDED BONUS.

16:53.220 --> 16:55.264
HEY.

17:14.325 --> 17:16.160
WAS THAT OKAY?

17:22.959 --> 17:24.836
IT WAS NICE.

17:24.878 --> 17:27.254
OH, "NICE."

17:24.878 --> 17:27.254
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

17:27.296 --> 17:28.381
NO, IT WAS NICE.

17:28.422 --> 17:30.341
THAT'S DAMNING

17:28.422 --> 17:30.341
WITH FAINT PRAISE.

17:33.219 --> 17:34.637
YOU WANT TO

17:33.219 --> 17:34.637
GO MEET THE SEALS?

17:34.679 --> 17:37.056
I MEANT IT.

17:34.679 --> 17:37.056
IT WAS NICE.

17:37.097 --> 17:38.224
HMM?

17:38.265 --> 17:39.433
YES.

17:38.265 --> 17:39.433
THE SEALS MIGHT

17:38.265 --> 17:39.433
CHANGE YOUR MIND.

17:39.475 --> 17:42.896
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT

17:39.475 --> 17:42.896
YOU'RE A GOOD KISSER?

17:42.937 --> 17:44.313
NO,

17:44.355 --> 17:46.273
ABOUT YOUR STORY.

17:46.315 --> 17:48.359
THEY'RE WAY BETTER

17:46.315 --> 17:48.359
COMMUNICATORS

17:48.401 --> 17:49.694
THAN MANATEES.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.905
THEY EVEN HAVE

17:49.736 --> 17:51.905
DIALECTS.

17:51.946 --> 17:53.740
I THINK

17:51.946 --> 17:53.740
YOU'LL LOVE THEM.

17:53.781 --> 17:55.157
OKAY.

17:55.199 --> 17:56.283
COME ON.

17:56.325 --> 17:58.786
OKAY.

17:56.325 --> 17:58.786
HMM?

18:01.414 --> 18:02.373
WOW.

18:02.415 --> 18:04.584
THIS IS WHERE

18:02.415 --> 18:04.584
I SPEND MY DAYS.

18:04.625 --> 18:05.877
GOSH.

18:05.919 --> 18:07.169
YEAH.

18:08.838 --> 18:11.382
HELLO.

18:11.424 --> 18:12.800
YEAH, THE SEALS

18:12.842 --> 18:16.095
HAVE THIS AMAZINGLY INTRICATE

18:12.842 --> 18:16.095
SYSTEM OF COMMUNICATION

18:16.136 --> 18:17.388
THAT LETS THEM

18:16.136 --> 18:17.388
SETTLE QUARRELS

18:17.430 --> 18:19.473
WITHOUT FIGHTING.

18:19.515 --> 18:20.850
IT'S PRETTY

18:19.515 --> 18:20.850
INCREDIBLE.

18:20.892 --> 18:22.727
COME HERE.

18:22.769 --> 18:25.688
WE SHOULD BE

18:22.769 --> 18:25.688
SO LUCKY.

18:25.730 --> 18:28.232
IT'S VERY CIVILIZED.

18:28.274 --> 18:29.609
UM, YOU KNOW--

18:29.650 --> 18:31.736
WHOA, HEY, YOU KNOW,

18:29.650 --> 18:31.736
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.780
I WANT TO.

18:33.821 --> 18:35.740
UM...I KNOW YOU WENT--

18:42.329 --> 18:43.289
ARE YOU SURE?

18:43.330 --> 18:44.874
MM-HMM.

19:21.285 --> 19:23.203
[ CRYING ]

19:29.669 --> 19:30.628
ARE YOU OKAY?

19:30.670 --> 19:33.089
I'M FINE.

19:33.131 --> 19:34.256
I'M FINE.

19:34.298 --> 19:36.634
I'M SORRY, DID I--

19:34.298 --> 19:36.634
DID I DO SOMETHING?

19:36.676 --> 19:38.302
NO, NO,

19:36.676 --> 19:38.302
I'M FINE, FINE.

19:38.344 --> 19:40.220
I DON'T THINK

19:38.344 --> 19:40.220
YOU'RE FINE.

19:40.262 --> 19:42.140
YOU'RE CRYING.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.475
I'M SO SORRY.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.475
DID I HURT YOU?

19:44.517 --> 19:46.226
NO.

19:46.268 --> 19:47.854
UM...

19:50.272 --> 19:52.566
ARE YOU OKAY?

19:52.608 --> 19:54.527
I...

19:54.568 --> 19:56.904
I...

19:56.946 --> 19:59.532
UM...

19:59.573 --> 20:00.741
SHH, SHH...

20:00.783 --> 20:02.702
OH, NO, NO.

20:00.783 --> 20:02.702
OH, SHH...

20:10.710 --> 20:12.920
OH, JENNY.

20:12.962 --> 20:16.090
HE LOOKS

20:12.962 --> 20:16.090
A LITTLE STRANGE.

20:16.132 --> 20:18.217
YEAH, I THINK

20:18.258 --> 20:20.136
HE HASN'T REALLY

20:18.258 --> 20:20.136
THAWED OUT YET.

20:20.178 --> 20:21.137
WE WERE AFRAID

20:21.179 --> 20:22.221
HE WAS GOING

20:21.179 --> 20:22.221
TO DECOMPOSE,

20:22.262 --> 20:23.222
SO SHANE AND I

20:23.263 --> 20:24.891
PUT HIM

20:23.263 --> 20:24.891
IN THE FREEZER.

20:24.932 --> 20:25.892
HOW IS SHANE?

20:25.933 --> 20:27.977
SHE SEEMS

20:25.933 --> 20:27.977
PREOCCUPIED.

20:28.019 --> 20:29.478
YEAH, YEAH,

20:28.019 --> 20:29.478
I DON'T KNOW.

20:29.520 --> 20:30.646
SHE'S NOT TALKING,

20:30.688 --> 20:32.065
BUT I THINK

20:30.688 --> 20:32.065
IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO

20:32.106 --> 20:34.192
WITH HER

20:32.106 --> 20:34.192
AND HER HOLLYWOOD WIFE.

20:34.233 --> 20:37.153
I'M NOT GOING TO STOP CALLING

20:34.233 --> 20:37.153

22:33.227 --> 22:35.229
IT'S TIMES

22:33.227 --> 22:35.229
LIKE THESE

22:35.271 --> 22:36.981
WHEN YOU REALIZE

22:35.271 --> 22:36.981
WHAT'S IMPORTANT,

22:37.023 --> 22:38.191
AND THOSE

22:37.023 --> 22:38.191
ARE THE PEOPLE

22:38.232 --> 22:39.150
WHO ARE THERE FOR YOU,

22:39.192 --> 22:40.400
THE ONES WHO GOT YOU THROUGH,

22:40.442 --> 22:43.779
AND...THEN THE ONES

22:40.442 --> 22:43.779

22:43.821 --> 22:46.782
AND I'VE

22:43.821 --> 22:46.782

22:51.620 --> 22:52.788
GET THROUGH

22:52.830 --> 22:54.165
THIS REALLY TERRIBLE

22:52.830 --> 22:54.165
TIME,

22:54.207 --> 22:56.209
AND I JUST--

22:54.207 --> 22:56.209
I JUST WANTED YOU ALL

22:56.250 --> 22:58.919
TO BE THE FIRST

22:56.250 --> 22:58.919
TO KNOW...

22:58.961 --> 23:00.963
JUST SHOW THEM,

22:58.961 --> 23:00.963
SHOW THEM.

23:02.380 --> 23:03.549
TONYA AND I

23:02.380 --> 23:03.549
ARE ENGAGED.

23:03.590 --> 23:05.009
WE'RE GETTING

23:03.590 --> 23:05.009
MARRIED.

23:05.051 --> 23:06.135
NO WAY.

23:06.177 --> 23:07.261
SHIT.

23:07.303 --> 23:09.180
I'M JUST--YOU KNOW,

23:07.303 --> 23:09.180
IT'S JUST A SHAME

23:09.222 --> 23:11.265

23:09.222 --> 23:11.265
TO SHARE THIS WITH US,

23:11.307 --> 23:16.145
BUT I'M SURE

23:11.307 --> 23:16.145
HE'D BE FILLED WITH JOY LIKE ME.

23:18.314 --> 23:20.107
IT'S A CONFLICT

23:18.314 --> 23:20.107
OF INTEREST.

23:20.149 --> 23:22.235
IT'S NOT FAIR TO THE CAC,

23:20.149 --> 23:22.235
AND IT'S NOT FAIR TO CANDACE.

23:22.276 --> 23:23.569
I'M SORRY,

23:23.610 --> 23:24.653
I DIDN'T THINK

23:23.610 --> 23:24.653
IT WAS GOING TO BE

23:24.695 --> 23:25.696
SUCH A BIG DEAL

23:24.695 --> 23:25.696
FOR YOU.

23:25.738 --> 23:26.697
I DON'T KNOW WHY

23:26.739 --> 23:27.698
YOU'RE FREAKING OUT

23:26.739 --> 23:27.698
ABOUT IT.

23:27.740 --> 23:29.200
BECAUSE YOU'RE EXPLOITING HER.

23:29.242 --> 23:30.743
I MEAN, SHE DOESN'T MAKE

23:29.242 --> 23:30.743
THAT MUCH MONEY,

23:30.784 --> 23:33.453
AND SHE MIGHT JUST HAVE FELT

23:30.784 --> 23:33.453
SHE HAD TO DO IT BECAUSE OF ME.

23:33.495 --> 23:35.581
SHE SEEMED HAPPY

23:33.495 --> 23:35.581
TO DO IT.

23:35.622 --> 23:37.208
SHE SAID YES?

23:38.918 --> 23:40.836
YES.

23:43.339 --> 23:44.840
SELFISH...

24:08.239 --> 24:09.447
I'M GOING TO

24:08.239 --> 24:09.447
HAVE TO ASK YOU

24:09.489 --> 24:11.033

24:09.489 --> 24:11.033
OUT OF HERE.

24:11.075 --> 24:12.701
LISTEN, I'M WAITING FOR SOMEONE.

24:12.743 --> 24:14.120
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WAIT

24:12.743 --> 24:14.120
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

24:15.955 --> 24:17.206
LISTEN, THEY'RE EXPECTING ME,

24:15.955 --> 24:17.206
ALL RIGHT?

24:17.248 --> 24:18.374
THEY'RE GOING TO BE OUT

24:17.248 --> 24:18.374
IN A MINUTE.

24:18.416 --> 24:19.375
NO, THEY WON'T,

24:19.417 --> 24:20.376
AND IF YOU DON'T GET YOURSELF

24:20.418 --> 24:22.086
FAR ENOUGH AWAY

24:20.418 --> 24:22.086
FROM THEIR HOUSE,

24:22.128 --> 24:23.337
YOU'RE GOING TO BE

24:22.128 --> 24:23.337
IN VIOLATION

24:23.379 --> 24:24.504
OF THE RESTRAINING ORDER

24:23.379 --> 24:24.504
THEY FILED AGAINST YOU.

24:24.546 --> 24:26.340
YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING?

24:28.134 --> 24:29.969
YEAH.

24:32.512 --> 24:34.348
FINE.

24:40.187 --> 24:42.106
[ DISHES CLANKING ]

24:56.245 --> 24:57.579
TINA.

25:03.336 --> 25:05.129
I'M SORRY.

25:06.880 --> 25:09.549
I-I OVERREACTED.

25:11.844 --> 25:13.304
OKAY.

25:13.346 --> 25:15.139
I MEAN, I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU

25:13.346 --> 25:15.139
HOW STRESSED OUT I AM.

25:15.181 --> 25:16.140
I MEAN,

25:16.182 --> 25:17.350
I KNOW

25:16.182 --> 25:17.350
THAT DOESN'T EXCUSE

25:17.391 --> 25:19.059
MY BEHAVIOR,

25:19.101 --> 25:21.437
BUT I THINK

25:19.101 --> 25:21.437
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A NICE THING

25:21.479 --> 25:23.772
IF YOU HAD TOLD ME

25:21.479 --> 25:23.772
THAT YOU WERE TALKING TO SOMEONE

25:23.814 --> 25:25.358
THAT I'M WORKING WITH.

25:25.399 --> 25:27.276
CAN WE TALK ABOUT THIS LATER?

25:25.399 --> 25:27.276
I'M MEETING OSCAR AND ESAI.

25:27.318 --> 25:29.778
CAN YOU ACCEPT MY APOLOGY?

25:29.820 --> 25:32.281
I ACCEPT YOUR APOLOGY.

25:34.408 --> 25:36.369
I'M SORRY

25:34.408 --> 25:36.369
I DIDN'T THINK

25:36.410 --> 25:38.620
TO WARN YOU.

25:38.662 --> 25:40.289
WE'VE BEEN

25:38.662 --> 25:40.289
A LITTLE OUT OF TOUCH.

25:40.331 --> 25:41.290
IT'LL BE OVER SOON.
