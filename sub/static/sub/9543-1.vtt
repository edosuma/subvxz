00:27.859 --> 00:29.665
What's your problem?

00:29.700 --> 00:32.488
Derek, you're avoiding the subject.

00:32.524 --> 00:36.274
What's wrong with the subject?
Your neck is my favorite subject.

00:36.309 --> 00:37.378
Let's go inside.

00:37.413 --> 00:40.254
You can't. You have to get up early
tomorrow. The S. A. T. S, remember?

00:40.289 --> 00:41.923
I'm not taking the stupid test.

00:41.958 --> 00:44.907
I'm just making sure the
little bastards don't cheat.

00:44.942 --> 00:47.268
What about Laurie?

00:47.303 --> 00:48.685
My wife? She took the S. A. T. s.

00:48.720 --> 00:50.625
I think she got about a 1680.

00:50.660 --> 00:51.786
I'm serious.

00:51.821 --> 00:55.479
If you don't tell her, I
mean, soon, I mean, tonight,

00:55.514 --> 00:57.003
I'm gonna do something about it myself.

00:57.038 --> 00:59.033
Beth, honey. Come on, now.

01:00.963 --> 01:02.205
We don't want to go there.

01:02.240 --> 01:03.750
We are there.

01:03.785 --> 01:06.193
This isn't like one of
your science experiments

01:06.228 --> 01:07.344
where you get to control everything.

01:07.379 --> 01:08.963
This is my life too.

01:08.998 --> 01:11.537
I know. I'm not 25 years old anymore.

01:11.572 --> 01:12.957
I know, honey.

01:12.992 --> 01:15.005
We could be happy anywhere.

01:15.040 --> 01:17.097
All right.

01:18.525 --> 01:20.014
- Let me just think.
- No!

01:20.049 --> 01:23.010
No more stalling, Derek.

01:23.045 --> 01:25.835
I mean it this time.

01:25.870 --> 01:27.184
I'm giving you until tomorrow night.

01:27.219 --> 01:28.687
Beth...

01:30.814 --> 01:33.228
Beth...

01:35.237 --> 01:38.028
Look, you're right.

01:38.063 --> 01:40.080
I'll tell her tonight
as soon as she gets home.

01:40.115 --> 01:43.042
Just tell her. Be brutal.

01:43.077 --> 01:47.933
"When 'tis done, 'twere
well it were done quickly."

01:47.968 --> 01:50.601
You have a quote for
everything, don't you?

01:50.636 --> 01:52.750
That's Macbeth.

01:52.785 --> 01:55.173
That's what you get for
dating an English teacher.

01:55.208 --> 01:56.851
All right. Tomorrow.

01:56.886 --> 02:00.340
Meet me, 8:00, before
the test, our usual spot.

02:00.375 --> 02:02.679
I'll tell ya how it went.

02:45.782 --> 02:48.167
Monk 2x01. Mr. Monk Goes back to School

02:48.202 --> 02:50.604
"It's a jungle out there"

02:50.639 --> 02:54.799
"Disorder and confusion everywhere"

02:54.834 --> 02:58.999
"No one seems to care Well, I do, hey"

02:59.034 --> 03:01.484
"Who's in charge here"

03:01.519 --> 03:04.899
"It's a jungle out there"

03:04.934 --> 03:08.373
"Poison in the very air we breathe"

03:08.408 --> 03:11.752
"Do you know what's in the
water that you drink, well, I do"

03:11.787 --> 03:14.890
"And it's amazing"

03:14.925 --> 03:18.350
"People think I'm crazy
'cause I worry all the time"

03:18.385 --> 03:21.675
"If you paid attention
you'd be worried too"

03:21.710 --> 03:26.020
"You better pay attention or
this world we love so much"

03:26.055 --> 03:29.856
"Might just kill you"

03:29.891 --> 03:32.153
"I could be wrong now"

03:32.188 --> 03:34.139
"But I don't think so"

03:34.174 --> 03:36.693
"'Cause it's a jungle out there"

03:36.728 --> 03:40.356
"It's a jungle out there"

03:47.461 --> 03:50.342
- Adrian, don't do that.
- I'm just centering the pieces.

03:50.377 --> 03:52.555
I know what you're doing.
I'm trying to concentrate.

03:52.590 --> 03:55.401
Hold on. You'll thank me later.

03:55.436 --> 03:57.545
You always say that.

03:57.580 --> 04:02.716
- Have I ever once thanked you later?
- No.

04:04.978 --> 04:07.594
- Are you done?
- Wait.

04:09.332 --> 04:11.715
Okay.

04:11.750 --> 04:15.283
Oh, ho-ho! You don't want to move there.

04:15.318 --> 04:16.185
Why not?

04:16.221 --> 04:21.019
I'll capture your queen with my bishop.

04:21.053 --> 04:23.697
What are you doing?

04:23.732 --> 04:27.694
- What...
- Your move.

04:27.729 --> 04:30.774
Okay. Okay, I win. You just forfeited.

04:30.809 --> 04:33.863
- Why?
- You can't do that. It's illegal.

04:33.898 --> 04:36.505
What?
- You know what. You can't lick the queen.

04:36.540 --> 04:37.408
She's my queen.

04:37.443 --> 04:39.406
Doesn't matter whose queen it is.

04:39.441 --> 04:42.633
You can't lick any queen.
It's an unwritten rule.

04:42.668 --> 04:44.758
There's an unwritten
licking-the-queen rule?

04:44.793 --> 04:47.542
You're not even allowed to
touch a piece during a game.

04:47.577 --> 04:48.901
- You can ask anybody.
- Oh, my God.

04:48.936 --> 04:50.741
You have been touching
pieces left and right.

04:50.776 --> 04:54.097
You have been sexually harassing
every piece on this board.

04:54.132 --> 04:55.793
I was centering them. That's different.

04:55.828 --> 05:02.831
- How's that different?
- Okay. Okay. Okay. I'll move.

05:02.866 --> 05:07.022
- There.
- Check.

05:15.577 --> 05:19.534
Adrian Monk's office. Could
you just hold on one sec?

05:19.569 --> 05:22.418
Adrian, do you know an Arleen Cassidy?

05:22.453 --> 05:24.684
Arleen Cassidy? Oh, my God.

05:24.719 --> 05:26.608
Trudy used to talk about her all the time.

05:26.643 --> 05:30.084
- They went to high school together.
- Oh.

05:30.119 --> 05:34.279
Hi. I'm sorry. Uh-huh. Sure.

05:34.314 --> 05:38.273
Yes, I know where that
is. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

05:40.157 --> 05:43.985
Okay. Thank you.

05:44.020 --> 05:46.625
Adrian, she really wants to talk to us.

05:46.660 --> 05:49.663
She just gave me the address.
She said it's very important.

05:49.698 --> 05:52.248
- Do you think we should go?
- It could be a job.

05:52.283 --> 05:54.918
- Do you want to leave now?
- Yeah.

05:54.953 --> 05:56.875
- Before we finish the game?
- Yeah.

05:56.910 --> 05:58.807
Then you forfeit.

06:00.668 --> 06:02.509
Wait. This is a handicap space.

06:02.544 --> 06:05.182
I think we qualify.

06:05.217 --> 06:08.751
Wow! This is where Trudy went to school?

06:08.786 --> 06:12.181
- How'd she afford it?
- On scholarship.

06:12.216 --> 06:14.365
Oh, she loved it here.

06:14.400 --> 06:17.627
She described it to me in such detail.

06:17.662 --> 06:21.881
I almost feel like I went
to school here. Trudy!

06:21.916 --> 06:23.987
All right. Then let it ride.

06:24.022 --> 06:26.210
You know, bet the whole 200.

06:26.245 --> 06:27.825
What's the spread on Michigan?

06:27.860 --> 06:29.695
Uh, excuse me? Excuse me.

06:29.730 --> 06:31.399
Hold on, J. J. Can I help you?

06:31.434 --> 06:34.733
Yeah, we're looking for Arleen
Cassidy. She's the vice principal.

06:34.768 --> 06:35.885
Uh-huh. You reporters?

06:35.920 --> 06:38.243
No, we're with the police.

06:38.278 --> 06:42.469
My wife went here. Did you
know her? Trudy Ellison.

06:42.504 --> 06:43.554
No. I only been here a year.

06:43.589 --> 06:46.314
She was valedictorian.
Great. Congratulations.

06:46.349 --> 06:47.796
She was on the yearbook committee...

06:47.831 --> 06:50.851
Adrian, he didn't know her.

06:51.549 --> 06:54.934
Um, where would we find Miss Cassidy?

06:54.969 --> 06:57.936
Uh, administration building, second floor.

06:57.971 --> 07:02.379
Thanks. Oh! Sorry. Were
you here this morning?

07:02.414 --> 07:04.102
No. Missed it.

07:04.137 --> 07:06.309
Thank God, huh? Heartbreak, isn't it?

07:06.344 --> 07:08.983
But what are you gonna do? Hey, you there?

07:10.246 --> 07:13.697
I was living in New York when
I heard the news about Trudy.

07:13.732 --> 07:17.075
- I cried for weeks.
- Oh. We all cried.

07:17.110 --> 07:19.821
And they never caught
the people responsible?

07:19.856 --> 07:21.421
We're still looking.

07:21.456 --> 07:22.933
Were you and Trudy close?

07:22.968 --> 07:24.963
Oh. We were like sisters.

07:24.998 --> 07:27.102
But everybody felt that way about Trudy.

07:27.137 --> 07:30.466
I helped her through algebra, and
she got me through English lit.

07:30.501 --> 07:33.307
She was a wonderful writer. Did
you ever read any of her poems?

07:33.342 --> 07:36.248
- I read them almost every night.
- Oh!

07:36.283 --> 07:39.356
I'm so sorry I never
made it to the wedding.

07:39.391 --> 07:43.359
- Was it wonderful?
- It was. Wonderful.

07:43.394 --> 07:47.600
So, uh, what happened here today?

07:47.635 --> 07:52.533
One of my teachers died a few
hours ago. I'm still shaking.

07:52.568 --> 07:55.651
Um, her name was Beth
Landow. She was first-rate.

07:55.686 --> 07:58.298
One of the best English teachers I had.

07:58.333 --> 08:00.412
They found her over
there by the clock tower.

08:00.447 --> 08:02.993
The police are calling
it an apparent suicide.

08:03.028 --> 08:04.284
But you don't believe them.

08:04.319 --> 08:06.548
No, it's not that I don't believe them,

08:06.583 --> 08:08.464
but they didn't know her.

08:08.499 --> 08:11.689
Why don't you think Miss
Landow killed herself?

08:11.724 --> 08:16.015
Look. Beth worried. Maybe too much.

08:16.050 --> 08:17.682
She cared maybe too much.

08:17.717 --> 08:22.783
But she was not suicidal. I
will never believe that. Ever.

08:22.818 --> 08:24.308
You want me to look into it?

08:24.343 --> 08:26.783
- L... I can pay you.
- No.

08:26.818 --> 08:30.998
No, uh, I couldn't take a nickel.

08:31.033 --> 08:32.753
It's for Trudy.

08:34.532 --> 08:37.524
Just tell him to wait. I'll let him know.

08:37.558 --> 08:40.448
Okay, boys and girls,
let's wrap it up. That's it.

08:40.484 --> 08:42.414
Tell the medical
examiner we're on our way,

08:42.448 --> 08:44.289
and I want that report
on my desk in the morning.

08:44.324 --> 08:48.257
Captain, Adrian Monk is downstairs.

08:48.292 --> 08:51.588
- Why? - The vice principal
asked him to look into it.

08:51.623 --> 08:56.704
It turns out that Trudy, his
former... ex-wife... late...

08:56.739 --> 08:59.279
Yeah, I know who Trudy was, Lieutenant.

08:59.314 --> 09:00.780
This is her alma mater.

09:00.815 --> 09:03.632
He'd like to come upstairs.

09:03.667 --> 09:07.032
Hang on. Nobody move.

09:07.067 --> 09:09.714
What am I forgetting?

09:09.749 --> 09:12.197
- We got the prints off the railing.
- Yes, sir.

09:12.232 --> 09:14.898
We've got photographs of
everything, every angle.

09:14.933 --> 09:18.655
- Did you bag the shoes?
- Yes, sir. Done.

09:18.690 --> 09:23.869
Medical examiner will get the tissue
and the fibers... - Don't worry, sir.

09:23.904 --> 09:26.206
- 'We're covered here.
- You got the code...

09:26.241 --> 09:29.582
Sir. We've got it.

09:29.617 --> 09:33.545
- All right. Let him up.
- Bring him up!

09:39.425 --> 09:41.379
Don't look down.

09:44.556 --> 09:46.489
Hey, Monk.
- Captain.

09:46.524 --> 09:49.597
Sharona.
- Lieutenant.

09:49.632 --> 09:52.684
Oh, I imagine this is your worst
nightmare... a crime scene on a roof.

09:52.719 --> 09:55.725
No. It's not my worst nightmare.

09:55.760 --> 09:59.505
It's my fourth worst.
Uh... No, wait. Fifth.

09:59.540 --> 10:02.957
No, fourth. Fourth... Fourth or fifth.

10:02.992 --> 10:05.875
I didn't bring the list with me.

10:05.910 --> 10:09.033
What's Homicide doing here?
It's supposed to be a suicide.

10:09.068 --> 10:12.579
It's not a suicide until
we say it's a suicide.

10:12.614 --> 10:14.828
This happens to be one.

10:14.863 --> 10:15.957
No signs of a struggle?

10:15.992 --> 10:19.762
No. She left her jacket
neatly folded over there.

10:19.797 --> 10:23.234
- What... What's that?
- Those are her shoes.

10:23.269 --> 10:24.595
She folded her jacket there?

10:24.630 --> 10:26.947
Why did she leave her shoes over here?

10:26.982 --> 10:29.144
She jumped.

10:29.179 --> 10:32.297
She was taking antidepressants,
and we found a note.

10:32.332 --> 10:35.160
It was in one of her pockets.

10:35.195 --> 10:36.618
It's printed. Yep.

10:36.653 --> 10:38.751
Usually they're written longhand.

10:38.786 --> 10:41.058
I've seen 'em printed.
I've seen 'em written.

10:41.093 --> 10:44.151
I've seen 'em written in blood,
I've seen 'em written in crayon.

10:44.186 --> 10:47.875
I've seen it all.
- Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy, easy, easy.

10:50.177 --> 10:53.253
"To whomever I may have hurt, the world
and it's problems arejust too much.

10:53.288 --> 10:55.343
I am so sorry. Beth."

10:55.378 --> 10:58.177
I don't think Beth Landow wrote this note.
- Why not?

10:58.212 --> 11:01.818
Well, it should be "its"...
"I-T-S," no apostrophe.

11:01.853 --> 11:05.318
And then here it would be
"whoever,"not "whomever."

11:05.353 --> 11:08.921
This wasn't written by a, quote,
"first-rate English teacher."

11:08.956 --> 11:11.578
Well, she was distraught.
She wasn't thinking straight.

11:11.613 --> 11:14.269
It's a suicide note, for Christ's sake!

11:14.304 --> 11:16.151
Did anybody see her jump?

11:16.186 --> 11:20.780
No. About 50 kids heard it though.

11:21.540 --> 11:25.855
Everyone was inside taking
the S. A. T. S at the time.

11:25.890 --> 11:29.135
But they... they were in the
main building, and they...

11:29.170 --> 11:30.674
How did they hear anything?

11:30.709 --> 11:32.493
She hit a car.

11:32.528 --> 11:33.873
The alarm went off.

11:33.908 --> 11:34.996
She hit a car?

11:35.031 --> 11:36.843
Yeah. Come look.

11:39.466 --> 11:42.727
- How old was
she? - Thirty-six.

11:42.762 --> 11:44.977
Which one was her car?

11:45.012 --> 11:47.397
The white Corolla right over there.

11:47.432 --> 11:51.717
Uh-huh. And whose car was this?

11:51.752 --> 11:55.995
- Derek Philby.
- Another teacher's. Is there a problem?

11:56.030 --> 11:59.039
Why would anyone park here
with all these broken bottles?

11:59.074 --> 12:03.709
- He could have parked anywhere.
- I've parked on broken bottles before.

12:03.744 --> 12:07.658
- And the doors are unlocked.
- Yeah. It's a safe neighborhood.

12:07.693 --> 12:09.471
You're right. It is a safe neighborhood.

12:09.506 --> 12:13.506
So why was the alarm turned on?

12:13.541 --> 12:15.163
It doesn't make sense.

12:15.198 --> 12:16.486
No, it never does.

12:16.521 --> 12:18.216
She just cut her hair last week.

12:18.251 --> 12:20.296
Why would she do that
if she was planning to...

12:20.331 --> 12:22.802
My sister suffers from depression,
and it works that way sometimes.

12:22.837 --> 12:25.431
Just overwhelms you.

12:25.466 --> 12:27.587
I didn't really know her.
Did she have any family?

12:27.622 --> 12:30.467
A brother in St. Louis, I think.

12:32.435 --> 12:37.474
Excuse me. Excuse me.
My name is Adrian Monk,

12:37.509 --> 12:40.185
and this is Sharona Fleming, my assistant.

12:40.220 --> 12:43.408
- Col... Colleague. - My
assistant-slash-colleague.

12:43.443 --> 12:46.100
- Colleague-slash-assistant.
- Um,

12:46.135 --> 12:48.940
I know this is a very difficult time.

12:48.975 --> 12:50.761
Uh, just wanted to ask
you a few questions.

12:50.796 --> 12:53.660
- Are you a policeman, Mr. Monk?
- Used to be.

12:53.695 --> 12:58.054
Um, I'm a private consultant now. I'm, uh,

12:58.089 --> 13:01.304
just helping the department
with their report.

13:08.210 --> 13:11.012
Were you all here when Miss Landow died?

13:11.047 --> 13:14.347
That's right. The students
were taking their S. A. T. s.

13:14.382 --> 13:15.768
We were proctoring the tests.

13:15.803 --> 13:18.391
So... So you were all together?

13:18.426 --> 13:20.810
No. We were in different classrooms.

13:20.845 --> 13:23.708
- Adrian.
- Excuse me. What are you doing?

13:23.743 --> 13:26.784
Oh, I'm... just making them even.

13:26.819 --> 13:30.359
But you're mixing the
regular with the decaf.

13:35.420 --> 13:40.367
- But they're even.
- But they're mixed together.

13:40.402 --> 13:44.294
- But they're... they're even.
- But they're mixed together.

13:44.329 --> 13:51.348
- But they're even.
- But they're mixed together.

13:51.383 --> 13:55.431
But they're even. So the test was in
progress when the car alarm sounded?

13:55.466 --> 13:59.190
Yes. We started the
test at 8:20 on the dot.

13:59.225 --> 14:02.247
- On the dot? - On
the dot. - On the dot?

14:02.282 --> 14:05.718
Uh, it starts at the same time all across
the country. It's a standardized test.

14:05.753 --> 14:08.109
You've never taken the S. A. T. S?

14:08.144 --> 14:11.880
No. No, they... they
gave me a different test.

14:11.915 --> 14:15.969
Can you think of any reason why
Beth would have killed herself?

14:16.004 --> 14:17.906
Yeah, we were just talking about that.

14:17.941 --> 14:20.004
Didn't she say anything in her note?

14:20.039 --> 14:23.184
No. It was pretty vague.

14:23.219 --> 14:26.824
- Uh, you're Mr. Philby?
- That's right. Derek Philby.

14:26.859 --> 14:30.344
- And you teach...
- Chemistry and biology.

14:30.379 --> 14:33.025
And it was your car that
she landed on, right?

14:33.060 --> 14:35.765
Yeah. Even if they can fix
it, I can't imagine driving it.

14:35.800 --> 14:37.696
It just wouldn't...
It wouldn't feel right.

14:37.731 --> 14:41.889
No, of course not. Of course
not. Could I ask you something?

14:41.924 --> 14:44.668
Apparently, there's no stopping you.

14:46.476 --> 14:49.337
Why did you park by the tower?

14:49.372 --> 14:52.256
Isn't there faculty
parking near the classrooms?

14:52.291 --> 14:56.875
I was gonna take a jog after the S. A. T.
S, so I wanted to park by the field.

14:56.910 --> 15:01.748
Which reminds me, I need
to call a taxi to get home.

15:01.783 --> 15:06.045
I have the number in here somewhere.

15:06.080 --> 15:09.288
- You left your car alarm on?
- Hmm?

15:09.323 --> 15:11.092
You left your car alarm on,

15:11.127 --> 15:15.568
- but your doors were unlocked.
- I forgot.

15:15.603 --> 15:19.638
- I guess I'm not perfect.
- I guess you're not.

15:20.758 --> 15:22.565
- He's the guy.
- Who's the guy?

15:22.600 --> 15:24.413
"Mr. Science." Derek Philby.

15:24.448 --> 15:26.947
He asked about a suicide
note. I never mentioned a note.

15:26.982 --> 15:29.823
Well, maybe he just assumed.
Isn't there usually a suicide note?

15:29.858 --> 15:32.401
As a matter of fact, there isn't.
Also, he cheats on his wife.

15:32.436 --> 15:34.005
- How do we know this?
- Wedding ring.

15:34.040 --> 15:35.083
He was wearing his wedding ring.

15:35.118 --> 15:37.403
Yes, I know. But he takes it off a lot.

15:37.438 --> 15:38.427
When he opened his wallet,

15:38.462 --> 15:41.626
I noticed a small indentation
in the leather where he keeps it.

15:41.661 --> 15:43.894
You noticed that? A little indentation?

15:43.929 --> 15:46.589
It's a gift... and a curse.

15:46.624 --> 15:47.624
He's the guy.

15:47.659 --> 15:50.046
But, Adrian, he was proctoring
the S. A. T. S at the time,

15:50.081 --> 15:52.485
- and there were 50 students in the room.
- That's true.

15:52.520 --> 15:55.596
So how could he have killed her?
He can't be in two places at once.

15:55.631 --> 16:00.138
I know. It's impossible. But he's the guy.

16:05.981 --> 16:08.224
- There's my girl.
- She looked happy.

16:08.259 --> 16:11.520
Oh, she was very happy.
She hadn't met me yet.

16:11.555 --> 16:14.235
You wanted to see her
appointment book. This is a copy.

16:14.270 --> 16:16.297
- The police took the original.
- Thanks.

16:16.332 --> 16:18.576
Can you tell me about Derek Philby?

16:18.611 --> 16:21.330
Yeah, he's... he's the most
popular teacher in the school.

16:21.365 --> 16:24.461
He has a wonderful family.
We're gonna miss him terribly.

16:24.496 --> 16:26.760
- He's leaving?
- He got another job.

16:26.795 --> 16:30.298
He's going to be headmaster at
Lincoln Academy in Marin County.

16:30.333 --> 16:33.632
It's a big promotion.

16:33.667 --> 16:37.715
Miss Cassidy, could Beth Landow
have been involved with Derek Philby?

16:37.750 --> 16:41.309
Beth and Derek? I don't think so.

16:41.344 --> 16:45.391
Why?
- He was using a pen from the Modesto Inn.

16:45.426 --> 16:49.400
I think I'd like to spend a little more time
with Mr. Philby, get to know him better.

16:49.435 --> 16:51.818
Adrian, you can't skulk around the school.

16:51.853 --> 16:53.575
I'm not gonna skulk. I don't skulk.

16:53.610 --> 16:58.766
Stottlemeyer said the
investigation is officially over.

16:58.801 --> 17:03.762
She's right. - We still haven't found
a substitute to take Beth's class.

17:07.416 --> 17:10.929
Don't even think about it.

17:10.964 --> 17:12.602
They're teenagers.

17:20.391 --> 17:23.109
Hello.

17:23.145 --> 17:25.906
I understand that, uh,

17:25.942 --> 17:28.581
it's been a very difficult
time for everybody.

17:28.616 --> 17:33.652
I'm going to be filling
in for two or three days.

17:33.687 --> 17:40.581
And my name... is Mr...

18:42.094 --> 18:45.054
Mr...

19:28.053 --> 19:32.022
Monk. Mr. Monk.

19:32.057 --> 19:36.354
Okay, I understand that
you've been, uh, reading...

19:36.389 --> 19:38.523
The Red Badge of
Courage, by Stephen Crane.

19:38.558 --> 19:44.125
It's one of my favorite books.
We'll start with chapter one.

19:51.495 --> 19:53.962
What's up with that "K"?

20:06.433 --> 20:09.379
Oh, my God.

20:09.414 --> 20:14.444
Adrian. Adrian, are
you okay? What happened?

20:14.479 --> 20:16.443
Chalk dust.

20:16.478 --> 20:21.138
I have to... go to the
nurse. Can't breathe.

20:21.173 --> 20:24.527
Give me that chalk. Can you manage to sit?

20:27.534 --> 20:31.503
- Okay, who threw this?
- Kyle!

20:38.919 --> 20:41.432
- What's your name?
- I didn't do it.

20:41.467 --> 20:44.246
Look, I know when a man's lying, okay?

20:44.281 --> 20:47.143
- I was married for three and a half years.
- I didn't do it.

20:47.178 --> 20:49.308
I know that smirk.

20:49.343 --> 20:52.687
My husband had that same stupid smirk on
his face when he got back from Bally's,

20:52.722 --> 20:55.820
where, it turns out, he spent
the weekend with Betsy Bennett,

20:55.855 --> 20:57.610
his so-called
ex-girlfriend.

20:57.645 --> 21:00.278
Bally's? Lady, what are you talking about?

21:01.864 --> 21:04.943
Is that chalk on your hand?

21:04.978 --> 21:06.232
Maybe I should call your parents.

21:06.267 --> 21:07.213
You don't have to.

21:07.248 --> 21:09.518
My dad's a gym teacher here,
and he's gonna be pissed.

21:09.553 --> 21:13.721
- I'm really scared.
- You should be.

21:13.756 --> 21:18.169
- Ow, lady! You're gonna get fired!
- Yeah? I don't work here, chump.

21:25.016 --> 21:27.920
Hey, great... great work, everybody.

21:29.388 --> 21:33.305
For tomorrow, we'll
read chapters one and...

21:33.340 --> 21:36.059
Uh, one...

21:36.094 --> 21:38.473
Oh, read whatever the hell you want.

21:46.276 --> 21:47.706
Brings back memories, huh?

21:47.741 --> 21:50.545
Yeah. Mostly bad ones.

21:50.580 --> 21:53.744
-Did you check out Beth Landow's
appointment book? -Yeah.

21:53.779 --> 21:57.357
Nothing unusual. She had a
doctor's appointment three days ago.

21:57.392 --> 22:00.218
I'm-I'm looking into it.

22:00.253 --> 22:03.383
Oh, thank you.

22:03.418 --> 22:06.494
From this angle, that looks
a little bit like food.

22:06.529 --> 22:10.321
- It's vegetarian lasagna.
- No, thank you.

22:15.096 --> 22:18.303
I bet you always sat at
the popular kids'table.

22:18.338 --> 22:22.019
I bet that was you over there.

22:22.054 --> 22:24.204
- Where were you?
- I'm over there.

22:28.572 --> 22:31.654
I should go over and talk to him.

22:31.689 --> 22:35.005
- What would you say?
-"Things get worse."

22:35.040 --> 22:41.936
- Mixed vegetables or
mac-cheese? - Can I have both?

22:41.971 --> 22:43.589
Can I have neither?

22:43.624 --> 22:47.311
If I don't get at least a
1550, my dad is gonna kill me.

22:49.279 --> 22:51.794
Excuse me. Uh,

22:51.829 --> 22:56.595
- did you take the S. A. T. S on Saturday?
- Yeah.

22:56.630 --> 23:01.822
Uh, by any chance, were you in,
uh, Mr. Philby's room? - Yeah.

23:01.857 --> 23:04.559
So when Miss Landow died,

23:04.594 --> 23:06.370
you heard the car alarm go off?

23:06.405 --> 23:09.160
Everybody did. And there
were people screaming.

23:09.195 --> 23:11.378
I guess everyone ran
to the window then, huh?

23:11.413 --> 23:12.907
Yeah, pretty much.

23:12.942 --> 23:15.735
What did Mr. Philby do?
Did you happen to notice?

23:15.770 --> 23:18.878
Yeah. We were talking about
that later. He never moved.

23:18.913 --> 23:21.275
He never even looked up.

23:21.589 --> 23:23.671
- What's up, Mr. P.?
- Randy.

23:23.706 --> 23:25.416
Good luck today. You got
another shutout in ya?

23:25.451 --> 23:28.315
- You know it. -
That-a-boy. Mr. Monk.

23:28.350 --> 23:31.806
Derek. I heard you were
filling in today. How'd it go?

23:31.841 --> 23:33.764
It was... great. It was great.

23:33.799 --> 23:36.522
Actually, I heard you got
off to a bit of a rough start.

23:36.557 --> 23:38.508
Want friendly advice?

23:38.543 --> 23:42.255
Control the classroom.
Don't let 'em see you sweat.

23:42.290 --> 23:46.523
Believe me, he's much
better at his other job.

23:46.558 --> 23:50.780
- Which is what?
- Catching murderers.

23:55.086 --> 23:57.232
Mr. Philby?
- Yes.

23:57.267 --> 24:00.199
- Got a minute?
- Actually, no. My wife is picking me up.

24:00.234 --> 24:01.707
I have an ethical question for you.

24:01.742 --> 24:09.428
Yesterday I was talking to that
policeman, Mr. Monk, and I lied to him.

24:09.463 --> 24:16.690
That's wrong, isn't it... lying to a
policeman? Been bothering me all day.

24:16.725 --> 24:19.354
What did you tell him?

24:19.389 --> 24:22.526
He wanted to know if I saw anything
Saturday morning, anything unusual,

24:22.561 --> 24:26.815
and I told him didn't.
The fact is, Mr. P., I did.

24:26.850 --> 24:30.572
I got to give you credit. It was
pretty clever how you pulled that off.

24:30.607 --> 24:34.774
Honey! - At first I didn't know
what the hell I was looking at.

24:34.809 --> 24:39.913
Pretty smart. Apparently not smart enough.

24:39.948 --> 24:45.904
I'll cut right to the thing. I owe some
friends of mine some money. How much?

24:45.939 --> 24:48.285
Ten thousand dollars,
and I need it by tomorrow.

24:51.719 --> 24:53.600
You see that? The Class of'77.

24:53.635 --> 24:55.675
We had one of these murals
in our high school too.

24:55.710 --> 24:58.638
Everybody painted a little piece of it.

25:00.259 --> 25:02.808
Trudy painted these flowers.

25:02.843 --> 25:04.979
How can you tell?

25:05.014 --> 25:07.069
I can tell.

25:07.104 --> 25:11.127
Hey, hey, hey. Not so fast, sister.

25:11.162 --> 25:13.167
I'm Kyle Patterson's father.

25:13.202 --> 25:15.377
You were hassling my
kid during second period?

25:15.412 --> 25:17.977
- Excuse me?
- Uh, I was there.

25:18.012 --> 25:21.139
Your son was way out of line.
He threw an eraser at me.

25:21.174 --> 25:25.469
- He says it was an accident.
- Well, maybe it was.

25:25.504 --> 25:28.332
- Although it wasn't.
- Who are you?

25:28.367 --> 25:33.499
I'm, uh... I'm, uh, Monk.
Um, Adrian Monk. Adrian.

25:33.534 --> 25:38.537
Well, Adrian, this is between me and
the lady. Or should I say the other lady?

25:38.572 --> 25:40.949
No, I think... I think
this is between you and me.

25:40.984 --> 25:42.604
Whatever you say, Adrian.

25:42.639 --> 25:44.301
- Come on. Come on.
- Hey, Coach.

25:44.336 --> 25:47.535
Hey, guys. Huh? Never
give up. You know that.

25:49.973 --> 25:52.438
I'm gunnin' for you, pal.

25:52.473 --> 25:58.741
When you least expect me,
that's when you can expect me.

25:58.776 --> 26:05.127
Uh, wait, wait. Uh, I'm sorry.
Uh, when I least expect what?

26:05.162 --> 26:09.493
Expect me when you least expect me.

26:09.528 --> 26:11.595
But that doesn't make sense, though. Uh...

26:11.630 --> 26:15.491
When the time comes,
it'll make perfect sense.

26:19.130 --> 26:23.020
Do you know what the
hell he was talking about?

27:40.497 --> 27:42.923
Somebody burnt the toast.

27:42.958 --> 27:45.934
- What do you think?
- I think it's weird.

27:45.969 --> 27:49.025
Guy worked at the same school. We
got two dead people. That's weird.

27:49.060 --> 27:51.857
Yeah, that's what I was gonna say. Weird.

27:51.892 --> 27:55.358
Captain, what do ya got? Oh, it looks
like a pinhole rupture in the gas line.

27:55.393 --> 27:56.935
Happens all the time. He came in,

27:56.970 --> 28:01.336
tried to relight the pilot 'cause he
wanted to make a fire and, uh, he did.

28:01.371 --> 28:03.833
Monk, what do you think?

28:05.711 --> 28:09.830
Monk, hey. What do you think?

28:11.611 --> 28:14.712
Uh, I-I don't think
he was lighting a fire.

28:14.747 --> 28:18.022
- You don't?
- No. It was pretty warm last night.

28:18.057 --> 28:21.706
That's true. Benjy didn't
even use his comforter.

28:21.741 --> 28:24.146
Plus, the air conditioner is on.

28:27.205 --> 28:28.547
He's right. It's on.

28:28.582 --> 28:31.302
And the flue wasn't open. This was murder.

28:33.117 --> 28:38.152
This was... This
premeditated... Excuse me.

28:49.869 --> 28:51.395
- You'll thank me later.
- All right.

28:51.430 --> 28:55.134
I think you're right about Beth Landow.
This is a crime scene. Let's lock it down.

28:55.169 --> 28:56.737
And I want to put a man in the school.

28:56.772 --> 28:59.979
You already have a man in the school.

29:01.919 --> 29:05.132
And this is General Grant. And
these are the Southern generals...

29:05.167 --> 29:10.846
surrendering at the courthouse in
Appomattox, Virginia, on April 9, 1865.

29:10.881 --> 29:14.355
Very good, Kathy. Very good.

29:14.390 --> 29:19.812
Okay. Excellent. So, who's next?

29:19.847 --> 29:23.112
- I am.
- Oh, good. Kyle.

29:31.570 --> 29:33.622
This is Sherman's march.

29:33.657 --> 29:37.620
This is them burning down Atlanta.

29:37.655 --> 29:40.959
- And what's that?
- That's a cannon.

29:40.994 --> 29:45.174
- I mean, next to the cannon.
- A tank.

29:45.209 --> 29:48.372
- A tank, Kyle?
- It's a Sherman tank.

29:48.407 --> 29:52.685
It's General Sherman,
Sherman's march, Sherman tank.

29:52.720 --> 29:59.105
Ha... Huh...I don't think the
Union Army had tanks, Kyle.

29:59.140 --> 30:03.482
- Well, my Dad helped me with it!
- I could be wrong.

30:03.517 --> 30:05.248
She made the bed.

30:05.283 --> 30:08.323
Why would she make the bed if
she was planning on leaping?

30:08.358 --> 30:11.818
I don't know. Maybe she was
just putting her house in order.

30:30.674 --> 30:34.361
- She wore glasses.
- So?

30:34.396 --> 30:35.944
Those sunglasses have
a heavy prescription.

30:35.979 --> 30:39.205
There were no eyeglasses
at the crime scene.

30:39.240 --> 30:42.122
- Contact lenses?
- I don't know.

30:43.827 --> 30:46.031
Let's find out, shall we?

30:47.029 --> 30:49.533
- This has gotta be it.
- What?

30:49.568 --> 30:51.784
This is Trudy's tree.

30:51.819 --> 30:53.663
She used to talk about it all the time.

30:53.698 --> 30:55.952
She said she used to get here early...

30:55.987 --> 31:01.170
and sit down under it and write poems.

31:01.205 --> 31:03.594
Poems about me.

31:03.629 --> 31:05.337
I thought you didn't meet her until later.

31:05.372 --> 31:08.505
Oh, she didn't know they
were about me until we met.

31:08.540 --> 31:10.620
That's what she used to say.

31:10.655 --> 31:13.625
Monk! Come here.

31:13.660 --> 31:15.520
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, he was right.

31:15.555 --> 31:17.896
I wasn't expecting him, and here
he is. Get in the car. Here we go.

31:17.931 --> 31:20.388
You're just gonna run away?
Absolutely. Join me, won't you?

31:20.423 --> 31:22.357
You can run, but you can't hide!

31:22.392 --> 31:24.819
Oh, yeah. I can hide.
Don't think I can't hide.

31:24.854 --> 31:27.396
- He thinks I can't hide.
- He doesn't know who he's messing with.

31:27.431 --> 31:29.958
Nobody hides like you.

31:39.660 --> 31:41.490
Adrian, what are you doing?

31:41.525 --> 31:44.450
The carrots and the
potatoes were touching.

31:44.485 --> 31:47.675
- Would you like separate plates?
- Of course I would.

31:47.710 --> 31:51.762
- Benjy, go get Mr. Monk separate plates.
- Okay.

31:56.922 --> 32:00.275
Mom says you're having a
tough time at school. - Huh?

32:00.310 --> 32:04.492
- Something about a bully?
- It's a misunderstanding.

32:04.527 --> 32:09.986
- Mom says he wants to kick your ass.
- No. I mean, yes.

32:10.021 --> 32:14.066
RememberJeffrey Appella? Kept
beating me up in the fifth grade?

32:14.101 --> 32:18.041
You said if I ran away from him,
I'd be running away my whole life.

32:18.076 --> 32:19.084
I said that?

32:19.119 --> 32:23.665
I hit him in the side one time,
and he never bothered me again.

32:23.700 --> 32:26.348
You can't be afraid of
everything, Mr. Monk. - Really?

32:26.383 --> 32:29.018
Adrian?

32:29.053 --> 32:31.468
Remember Beth Landow's
doctor's appointment?

32:31.503 --> 32:35.066
Well, it was with a Dr. Sedlik.
So I called my friend Maureen,

32:35.101 --> 32:38.864
whose roommate's sister knows
a nurse who works for him.

32:38.899 --> 32:42.603
And? She pulled her file for me.

32:42.638 --> 32:45.822
- Is that ethical?
- Do you care?

32:45.857 --> 32:49.500
No, I thought I should
ask because the kid's here.

32:49.535 --> 32:51.704
Your basic tennis ball.

32:51.739 --> 32:56.192
Cost me a dollar, fifty-nine
of my own money, Amy.

32:56.227 --> 32:59.186
We're about to put this
in some liquid nitrogen.

32:59.221 --> 33:01.648
Mr. Monk.

33:01.683 --> 33:03.668
Was your hand up? No.

33:03.703 --> 33:09.030
I have some questions, but
not about your tennis ball.

33:17.468 --> 33:20.531
And we just demonstrated what?

33:20.566 --> 33:25.628
- The atomic rearrangement of...
- Amorphous solids. - Very good.

33:25.663 --> 33:28.497
Q E. D. "Thus it is proved."

33:28.532 --> 33:30.929
All right, now, put the
goggles back on the lab shelf.

33:30.964 --> 33:33.196
Remember next Thursday
is midterms, all right?

33:33.231 --> 33:35.380
Bye, Mr. P. Good-bye, Marcia.

33:37.224 --> 33:39.800
Mr. Monk, you had a question.

33:39.835 --> 33:41.864
If you wouldn't mind.

33:41.899 --> 33:46.837
That's what teachers
do... satisfy curiosity.

33:46.872 --> 33:53.710
- Did you know Beth Landow was
pregnant when she died? -No.

33:53.745 --> 33:57.611
No, I didn't, but that would
explain why she jumped, wouldn't it?

33:57.646 --> 34:01.091
The baby's father, whoever he
was, must have run out on her, huh?

34:01.126 --> 34:05.771
You. You were the father.

34:05.806 --> 34:12.187
Unfortunately, you can't prove that, Mr.
Monk. Her body's already been cremated.

34:12.222 --> 34:14.475
What did she do, threaten
to tell your wife?

34:14.510 --> 34:17.648
You would have lost everything...
your new job, family...

34:17.683 --> 34:21.404
Again, impossible to prove.

34:21.438 --> 34:23.635
I think you're failing
this course, Mr. Monk.

34:23.670 --> 34:26.223
I think I'm doing all
right. I have a motive now.

34:26.257 --> 34:28.299
Well, you're gonna have to do a
little better than that, Mr. Monk,

34:28.333 --> 34:29.632
because you're in a science classroom now,

34:29.667 --> 34:30.699
and when you're in my
classroom, if you have a theory,

34:30.735 --> 34:33.380
you'd better have some
proof to back it up.

34:33.416 --> 34:36.596
I was proctoring the S. A. T.
Test when that poor girl died.

34:36.630 --> 34:43.858
- I never left the room.
- Okay?

34:43.893 --> 34:47.878
If that mouse vanished,

34:47.913 --> 34:50.647
you could think that the snake did it.

34:50.681 --> 34:54.373
I mean, he's got motive... He's
hungry; he likes to eat mice...

34:54.409 --> 34:56.487
But he's in a separate cage.

34:56.522 --> 34:58.452
There's no way that the
snake could have done it.

34:58.487 --> 35:01.573
It is one of the immutable
laws of physics, Mr. Monk...

35:01.608 --> 35:07.377
nothing can be in two
places at the same time.

35:07.412 --> 35:09.024
Any thoughts?

35:12.558 --> 35:16.470
I think the snake did it.

35:19.760 --> 35:21.527
No sign of a struggle.

35:21.562 --> 35:24.602
Her jacket folded neatly,
her shoes were over there.

35:24.637 --> 35:29.547
A note was in her pocket,
and he was across the campus.

35:29.582 --> 35:30.920
Maybe he had an accomplice.

35:30.955 --> 35:35.059
No. He's too smug. He's arrogant.

35:35.094 --> 35:40.312
You should have seen him earlier
today. He was...He was taunting me.

35:41.539 --> 35:44.750
How did he do it?

35:44.785 --> 35:49.959
Adrian, you're gonna make yourself crazy.

35:49.994 --> 35:52.659
Ah!

35:52.694 --> 35:55.012
What's wrong? I'm afraid...

35:55.047 --> 36:00.043
Okay, well, don't look down! No, I'm
afraid he's gonna get away with it.

36:00.078 --> 36:03.238
You'll get him. You always do.

36:03.273 --> 36:08.134
I think this guy...is smarter than me.

36:08.169 --> 36:10.674
Nobody's smarter than you.

36:10.709 --> 36:14.424
Come on. You'll think a lot
better when you're not so high up.

36:27.070 --> 36:30.122
- Adrian...
- What is it?

36:30.157 --> 36:34.677
Eyeglasses. They're Beth Landow's.

36:34.712 --> 36:37.425
Stottlemeyer called. He said they
still haven't been able to locate them.

36:37.460 --> 36:42.009
Adrian, if she jumped from
the roof, how'd they get here?

36:42.044 --> 36:46.437
- See, that's a good question.
- Thank you, boss.

36:47.142 --> 36:52.105
Hey, Professor. It's showtime.

36:52.140 --> 36:54.246
Oh, my God. Keep walking.

36:54.281 --> 36:56.638
If he catches up with
us, fall to the ground,

36:56.639 --> 36:58.739
curl up in a ball and protect your face.

36:58.774 --> 37:01.269
No. No, no, no, no. I
can't. I can't keep running.

37:01.304 --> 37:03.396
Benjy was right. I can't
run away from everything.

37:03.431 --> 37:06.826
You're gonna be picking up your
teeth with your broken fingers.

37:06.861 --> 37:08.575
Did you hear that about
the teeth and fingers?

37:08.610 --> 37:09.582
You want me to call the police?

37:09.617 --> 37:13.335
- No. No, I've got to do this.
- Come on. Come on.

37:16.907 --> 37:18.664
What?

37:22.048 --> 37:25.079
You hear that, Mr. Monk? It's 10:00 a. m.

37:25.114 --> 37:28.621
At 10:05, you're gonna be
waking up in an emergency room.

37:28.656 --> 37:30.478
- No!
- Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

37:30.513 --> 37:32.447
What do you mean, wait? Come
on! We're fightin' here!

37:32.482 --> 37:34.965
Wait. Just cut it out for a
minute, will ya? I'm thinking here.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.536
I'm thinking too. I'm thinking
about punching your lights out.

37:37.571 --> 37:42.283
- Will you shut up?
- Well... - Shut up.!

37:43.388 --> 37:46.616
- Did you solve the case?
- Thank you.

37:46.651 --> 37:49.091
- Thank you.
- For what?

37:49.126 --> 37:54.430
L... I couldn't have done it without
you. I'm gonna give your boy an "A."

37:54.465 --> 37:59.843
Really? Well, all right then.

37:59.878 --> 38:03.082
So, who won here?

38:11.068 --> 38:14.885
Mr. Monk. Derek, just wanted
to stop in and say good-bye.

38:14.920 --> 38:17.470
They found a full-time
replacement for the class.

38:17.505 --> 38:19.939
She's coming in tomorrow.

38:19.974 --> 38:22.440
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, Mr. Monk.

38:22.475 --> 38:25.873
A good teacher merely
explains. A great one inspires.

38:25.908 --> 38:27.571
And I think you could
have been a great teacher.

38:27.606 --> 38:30.317
Well, I'll still be here.
Just won't be teaching.

38:30.352 --> 38:33.412
Oh, yes. Your hypothetical murder
investigation. How is that going?

38:33.447 --> 38:35.757
Pretty well, actually. Thanks for asking.

38:35.792 --> 38:41.790
- We just got a big break. Her...
Her eyeglasses. - Eyeglasses...

38:41.825 --> 38:45.644
Beth Landow always wore glasses.
It seems she was blind without them.

38:45.679 --> 38:51.170
But, uh, they weren't near
her body or on the roof.

38:51.205 --> 38:53.023
Where are they, you suppose?

38:54.844 --> 38:56.691
I don't know.

38:56.726 --> 38:58.983
Well, we'll find them.

38:59.018 --> 39:02.342
Tomorrow morning, there'll be
about 200 police cadets here...

39:02.377 --> 39:04.569
searching every square inch of the campus.

39:04.604 --> 39:09.068
We'll find them. And when we do,

39:09.103 --> 39:14.193
we'll... we'll know where
Beth Landow was killed.

39:14.228 --> 39:19.128
Good luck. Yeah. Good luck.

40:13.671 --> 40:17.065
Working late, Mr. Philby?

40:17.100 --> 40:18.459
What's going on?

40:18.494 --> 40:24.139
Mr. Philby, you're under arrest for murder
in the first degree, special circumstances.

40:24.174 --> 40:27.912
Come on. That's insane.
I told you. I was...

40:27.947 --> 40:31.449
Proctoring the S. A. T.
S at the time. We know.

40:31.484 --> 40:35.069
It took me forever to figure
out how you pulled it off.

40:35.104 --> 40:37.607
But then it hit me. You
killed Beth Landow...

40:37.642 --> 40:39.706
before the test started.

40:39.741 --> 40:42.639
You met her on the clock tower
roof that morning at about 8:00,

40:42.674 --> 40:45.879
20 minutes before the test.

40:45.914 --> 40:47.675
Then you killed her,

40:47.710 --> 40:52.147
and you carried her body down
the stairs to the clock room.

40:52.182 --> 40:55.513
This was inspired. She fell, all right,

40:55.548 --> 41:01.187
but not from the roof.
She fell from the clock.

41:01.222 --> 41:04.912
You laid her body out on the minute hand.

41:04.947 --> 41:09.332
It was 8:15, so the hand
was perfectly horizontal.

41:09.367 --> 41:11.406
The S. A. T. S were to begin at 8:20.

41:11.441 --> 41:14.589
You had five minutes to
get back to the classroom.

41:14.624 --> 41:20.419
Plenty of time. And you
let gravity do the rest.

41:20.454 --> 41:24.337
It was just like one of
your science experiments.

41:24.372 --> 41:29.137
You took a pretty big risk, Philby,
hiding the body in plain sight.

41:29.172 --> 41:31.256
It wasn't such a bad bet.

41:31.291 --> 41:33.713
That side of the tower
faced the athletic field,

41:33.748 --> 41:36.727
which on a Saturday morning
was completely deserted.

41:36.762 --> 41:40.926
Tick tock, until 8:25,

41:40.961 --> 41:44.855
when the body slid off the
clock and landed on your car.

41:44.890 --> 41:47.290
You made sure that the
alarm was activated...

41:47.325 --> 41:53.320
so that everyone would know exactly
when she fell. It was a perfect alibi.

41:53.355 --> 41:55.862
There was only one problem...

41:55.897 --> 41:59.739
the groundskeeper just
happened to see you.

41:59.774 --> 42:01.919
But you took care of him later.

42:01.954 --> 42:06.044
I told you, Mr. Monk, a theory is
just that unless you have some proof.

42:06.079 --> 42:09.546
It's true. I don't have any proof.

42:09.581 --> 42:15.766
But you do. It's in your hand.

42:15.801 --> 42:18.968
Oh! You see, I... I
found these on the roof.

42:19.003 --> 42:21.589
I think they're Beth Landow's.
I think you're looking for them.

42:21.624 --> 42:23.905
You didn't find them on the roof.

42:23.940 --> 42:26.535
You found them in the clock
room under the gearbox,

42:26.570 --> 42:28.955
because I put them there two hours ago.

42:28.990 --> 42:34.106
Only Beth Landow's killer would
have known to look for them there.

42:34.141 --> 42:42.034
Q E. D. Quod erat demonstrandum...
"Thus it is proved".

42:45.239 --> 42:47.684
Get him out of here.

42:51.632 --> 42:53.757
Guess we have to find
another science teacher.

42:53.792 --> 42:57.803
Well, make sure you check
their references. I will.

42:57.838 --> 42:59.916
What was she like? Who?

42:59.951 --> 43:04.118
Trudy. Smart. Quiet. Didn't date much.

43:04.153 --> 43:07.530
Said she was waiting for the right man.
Said she'd know him when she met him.
