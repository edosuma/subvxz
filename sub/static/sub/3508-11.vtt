<Font color=#FFFFO0>The Fifth Bullet</font>

00:00.258 --> 00:01.237
There are two kinds of folks

00:01.264 --> 00:02.864
who sit around thinking
about how to kill people:

00:03.198 --> 00:04.924
psychopaths and mystery writers.

00:05.262 --> 00:06.284
I'm the kind that pays better.

00:06.585 --> 00:07.285
Who am I?

00:07.374 --> 00:08.513
I'm Rick Castle.

00:08.514 --> 00:08.608
Castle.

00:08.948 --> 00:09.608
Castle.

00:09.609 --> 00:11.309
I really am ruggedly handsome,
aren't I?

00:11.655 --> 00:13.945
Every writer needs inspiration.
And I found mine.

00:14.055 --> 00:14.974
Detective Kate Beckett.

00:15.009 --> 00:15.929
Beckett.
Beckett.

00:15.964 --> 00:17.870
- Nikki Heat?
- The character he's basing on you.

00:17.916 --> 00:19.502
And thanks to my friendship
with the mayor,

00:19.503 --> 00:20.503
I get to be on her case.

00:20.737 --> 00:22.480
I would be happy
to let you spank me.

00:22.515 --> 00:23.791
And together, we catch killers

00:24.439 --> 00:25.627
We make a pretty
good team, you know?

00:25.728 --> 00:26.428
Like Starsky and Hutch.

00:26.562 --> 00:27.256
Turner and Hooch.

00:27.257 --> 00:29.057
You do remind me
a little of Hooch.

00:35.538 --> 00:38.025
You drive, I'll ride.
All right.

00:41.823 --> 00:43.821
On one knee?
Yes, that's a good girl.

00:43.822 --> 00:45.789
What's up, Castle,
you proposing?

00:45.790 --> 00:48.224
Oh, no.
Just waiting for you.

00:48.225 --> 00:50.321
That's too bad.
You two make a cute couple.

00:50.322 --> 00:52.386
Yeah. Hey, you think
I should get a dog?

00:52.487 --> 00:54.650
- What am I, your wife?
- Yeah, you're my work-wife.

00:54.651 --> 00:55.583
No, I'm not your work-wife.

00:55.584 --> 00:57.484
I could get a bloodhound.
I could name him Sherlock,

00:57.784 --> 00:59.285
And then I could... I could
bring him to crime scenes.

00:59.286 --> 01:00.286
No, you couldn't.

01:00.386 --> 01:02.051
Oh, what? It'd be adorable.

01:02.052 --> 01:04.150
I could get him to wear
a little Sherlock hat,

01:04.251 --> 01:06.684
Train him how to carry
a little magnifying glass.

01:06.785 --> 01:08.284
Oh, see? Right there.

01:08.285 --> 01:10.718
Disapproving, judgmental...
you're totally my work-wife.

01:11.419 --> 01:14.586
Oh, the blood's bold,
but it works.

01:15.487 --> 01:16.953
Not sure he'd agree.

01:20.321 --> 01:21.053
Mm.

01:22.554 --> 01:25.487
Well, obviously, he was
into art.

01:25.788 --> 01:26.887
Victor Fink,

01:26.888 --> 01:29.087
43, gallery owner.

01:29.088 --> 01:30.388
There's no sign
of forced entry.

01:30.489 --> 01:34.088
Tenant upstairs call in
gunshots to 911 at 10:14 pm.

01:34.089 --> 01:35.690
Any idea what he was
doing here so late?

01:35.691 --> 01:37.091
No, but according to
his assistant,

01:37.191 --> 01:39.924
Darius Langley, they close
at 8:00. Far as he can tell,

01:39.925 --> 01:41.691
there's nothing missing off
the walls or from the back.

01:41.692 --> 01:43.092
Anything off those
security cameras?

01:43.592 --> 01:44.759
Fake. Not even hooked up.

01:44.860 --> 01:45.960
Lucky break for the guy.

01:46.060 --> 01:48.359
Unless he knew, just like
he knew Fink was working late.

01:48.360 --> 01:51.061
Or made plans to meet him here.
Check with the assistant.

01:51.162 --> 01:52.162
Right.

01:52.163 --> 01:53.463
He had some fight in him.

01:53.763 --> 01:56.063
Abrasions on the forearms,
on the hands.

01:56.164 --> 01:57.630
And then he made a run
for the stairs.

01:57.631 --> 01:58.931
Only to be shot in the back.

01:59.031 --> 02:01.031
Twice, 9 millimeter.

02:02.732 --> 02:04.132
Shooter fired from over here.

02:04.633 --> 02:05.633
Is it possible

02:05.675 --> 02:06.467
he might have been
meeting somebody?

02:06.468 --> 02:08.168
If he was meeting someone,
he didn't tell me.

02:08.768 --> 02:09.467
Excuse me
for a minute.

02:09.869 --> 02:11.536
He'd already left by the time
I locked up at 8:00.

02:12.037 --> 02:12.837
Mr. Langley,

02:13.037 --> 02:14.071
I'm Detective Kate Beckett.

02:14.272 --> 02:16.039
How long have you been
Mr. Fink's assistant?

02:16.340 --> 02:17.240
Two months.

02:17.282 --> 02:19.409
I'm an art student.
I take night classes at Tisch.

02:19.810 --> 02:20.911
Is that
where you were tonight?

02:21.112 --> 02:22.946
Yeah, Mr. Fink totally
supported me being in school.

02:24.047 --> 02:25.381
He'd let me leave early
to make classes.

02:26.182 --> 02:27.416
That's where I was
when you guys called.

02:28.417 --> 02:30.518
Do you know if Mr. Fink
had any enemies,

02:31.019 --> 02:33.087
Any unhappy clients
or artists?

02:33.488 --> 02:34.755
Nothing
out of the ordinary.

02:34.756 --> 02:36.858
I can get you a contact list
if you like.

02:36.859 --> 02:37.459
Yes, please.

02:37.559 --> 02:38.593
Okay.

02:39.994 --> 02:42.196
Hey, we got
a little problem.

02:42.197 --> 02:43.197
Mm-hmm.

02:43.297 --> 02:45.098
We dug these two slugs
out of the wall.

02:46.499 --> 02:48.234
They're not very fragmented.
See if ballistics

02:48.235 --> 02:50.303
can run a match on any of
the other shooting the city.

02:50.304 --> 02:51.805
Sure, but that's not
the problem.

02:51.806 --> 02:53.273
We dug these two
out of the wall,

02:53.674 --> 02:55.208
and Dr. Parish has another two
in our vic here.

02:55.309 --> 02:56.809
So our perp's
not a sharpshooter.

02:56.851 --> 02:58.809
But we've only found
four bullets,

02:58.910 --> 03:02.978
and there are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
shell casings on the ground.

03:02.979 --> 03:04.780
There's no blood trail
leading out of here.

03:04.781 --> 03:06.481
Exactly,
and not a drop of blood

03:06.581 --> 03:08.281
outside of the spatter
from our vic here.

03:08.282 --> 03:09.950
So there's no second victim?

03:10.151 --> 03:11.951
So where's the fifth bullet?

03:14.952 --> 03:16.720
The bullet was made of ice.

03:16.721 --> 03:18.521
Okay, great.
Yeah, send her up.

03:19.222 --> 03:20.490
Fink's wife
is on her way up.

03:20.991 --> 03:23.659
Fires the bullet. It melts
before we can find it.

03:25.160 --> 03:26.360
An ice bullet.

03:26.861 --> 03:29.963
Hello. An ice bullet, are you
even paying attention to me?

03:29.964 --> 03:33.264
No. You aren't saying anything
worth paying attention to.

03:33.465 --> 03:35.832
Yo. Uniforms
are still canvassing,

03:35.833 --> 03:37.700
but so far, they still
haven't found any blood trails

03:37.801 --> 03:38.499
outside the gallery.

03:38.500 --> 03:40.800
And CSU's
reswept the scene twice.

03:40.900 --> 03:41.866
No sign
of our fifth bullet.

03:42.067 --> 03:43.167
I'm telling you,

03:43.267 --> 03:44.068
Ice bullet.

03:44.069 --> 03:45.969
Nah, bro. An ice bullet would
still make a bullet hole.

03:46.069 --> 03:47.035
You mean ice hole.

03:47.136 --> 03:47.994
What'd you just call me?

03:48.010 --> 03:48.935
Guys, what else?

03:49.136 --> 03:50.236
We checked Fink's cell
phone records.

03:50.278 --> 03:53.534
He got a call at 9:19 pm,
an hour before he was killed,

03:53.535 --> 03:54.700
from a blocked
cell phone number.

03:54.701 --> 03:55.801
Phone records indicate

03:55.843 --> 03:57.301
that the call originated
here in New York,

03:57.302 --> 03:59.603
but it was an international
cell... satellite phone...

03:59.604 --> 04:00.871
registered to
Bahrain Cellular.

04:01.272 --> 04:02.472
Well, good luck
getting a warrant

04:02.514 --> 04:03.805
from the government
of Bahrain.

04:03.906 --> 04:05.639
Run down Fink's client
and artist list,

04:05.740 --> 04:07.675
see if any of them had
international numbers,

04:07.676 --> 04:08.510
and watch your mouth.

04:11.211 --> 04:12.044
I'm gonna go 10-1.

04:12.045 --> 04:14.945
Hey, Ryan. Got a sec?

04:15.846 --> 04:16.747
Witness?

04:16.748 --> 04:19.583
Not exactly.
Hang here, buddy, okay?

04:19.584 --> 04:20.683
Of course.

04:20.684 --> 04:22.919
I found him on the canvass
by the art gallery.

04:23.420 --> 04:25.154
I mean, the guy's got
no wallet, no I.D.

04:25.655 --> 04:27.456
Okay, did you ask him
his name?

04:27.457 --> 04:30.525
Yeah, I asked him his name.
I asked him where he lived.

04:31.026 --> 04:32.394
You know, but... but here's
the funny part...

04:33.295 --> 04:34.529
Guy says he don't remember.

04:35.430 --> 04:37.932
Did my husband have enemies?
Yeah, he had enemies.

04:38.633 --> 04:40.835
Every artist who couldn't
get in his gallery

04:41.336 --> 04:43.270
and every artist
who was in his gallery.

04:44.071 --> 04:45.771
He'd sell, like, five pieces,

04:45.772 --> 04:47.939
and they'd want to know
why he didn't sell six.

04:48.040 --> 04:49.741
Mrs. Fink,
I know you're upset...

04:49.742 --> 04:51.876
No, what am I supposed
to do with these, huh?

04:51.877 --> 04:52.645
I didn't want 'em.

04:52.746 --> 04:55.214
I did it for him,
and now he's dead.

04:56.415 --> 04:58.715
Mrs. Fink,
can you think of anyone

04:58.716 --> 04:59.750
who would hate
your husband enough

04:59.751 --> 05:01.719
to shoot him in cold blood
in the back?

05:01.720 --> 05:02.920
Rocco.

05:03.020 --> 05:05.354
Rocco? Was that
one of the artists?

05:05.355 --> 05:06.355
His assistant.

05:06.555 --> 05:08.323
I thought Darius
was his assistant.

05:08.324 --> 05:11.525
His old assistant. Victor fired
Rocco a few months back.

05:11.526 --> 05:12.293
Why?

05:12.294 --> 05:15.061
He fired that little insect
over money.

05:15.162 --> 05:17.397
Boy, did Rocco go crazy,
making all kinds of threats.

05:17.498 --> 05:19.698
"I'm gonna get you, Fink."
but you know what?

05:19.699 --> 05:23.301
No. Rocco? He wasn't even a man.
He was more like a flea.

05:23.402 --> 05:24.836
Victor didn't even
think twice about it.

05:25.637 --> 05:27.105
You suppose the flea
had a gun,

05:27.506 --> 05:28.906
A tiny gun
with vanishing bullets?

05:28.907 --> 05:30.508
Ice bullets
and fleas with guns...

05:30.609 --> 05:32.009
Do you have
writer's block again?

05:32.010 --> 05:33.210
Stephen King wrote stories

05:33.410 --> 05:35.745
of bloodthirsty cars
and sold millions of copies.

05:35.746 --> 05:37.380
I figure, why be limited
by logic?

05:38.081 --> 05:39.581
Rocco Jones...
Fink's old assistant.

05:39.681 --> 05:40.816
The wife said
that Rocco called

05:40.817 --> 05:42.584
and left threatening messages
for Fink.

05:42.585 --> 05:44.119
- See what you can find.
- I'm on it.

05:44.220 --> 05:45.822
Hey, what's up with Ryan?

05:47.323 --> 05:48.023
Mugging case.

05:48.123 --> 05:49.991
The guy got hit in the head
and can't remember who he is.

05:50.192 --> 05:52.860
Oh, missing bullets are cool.
Amnesia is even cooler.

05:55.695 --> 05:56.962
I'm sure you have
better things to do.

05:58.363 --> 05:59.630
I'm sure I do, too.

05:59.631 --> 06:00.898
Huh.

06:01.199 --> 06:03.833
You're inhaler.
You're asthmatic.

06:04.534 --> 06:05.801
Awesome.

06:06.202 --> 06:08.237
Y-you should probably
hang on to that.

06:08.238 --> 06:10.305
Inhaler, grocery bag,
keys...

06:10.406 --> 06:12.973
Are you telling me
you don't remember at all

06:12.974 --> 06:14.242
- What any of that is for?
- Yeah.

06:14.643 --> 06:16.310
How ridiculous is that?

06:16.511 --> 06:18.079
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:19.080 --> 06:21.114
so has he, uh,
really got amnesia?

06:21.115 --> 06:23.083
Yeah, but apparently,
my hearing's fine.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.917
Well, that's good.
Richard Castle.

06:26.118 --> 06:28.819
Hey. I... I'd introduce
myself, too, but...

06:28.820 --> 06:30.555
Yeah, we're just
going through his pockets.

06:30.556 --> 06:31.556
trying to find something

06:31.656 --> 06:32.590
that could tell us who he is.

06:32.591 --> 06:35.125
Oh, and apparently I've been
reading as well.

06:35.126 --> 06:38.859
Ah, "Crime and Punishment,"
Dostoyevsky. Classic.

06:39.360 --> 06:41.361
- You have excellent taste.
- Castle.

You know what?
If we got a dog,

07:09.474 --> 07:10.609
I could buy him
little saddlebags,

07:10.710 --> 07:12.278
And then he could carry
your books to school,

07:12.279 --> 07:14.113
And you wouldn't have to worry
about getting scoliosis.

07:14.214 --> 07:16.514
Conceptually, I'd like a dog
as much as you would.

07:16.614 --> 07:18.682
In reality, I'm not seeing
the guy whose dishes

07:18.683 --> 07:20.617
Never make it to the sink
bending over

07:20.618 --> 07:22.120
to scoop poop in Hudson Park.

07:23.121 --> 07:24.621
Oh. I bet I could train him
to use a toilet.

07:24.721 --> 07:25.790
Uh-huh.

07:27.092 --> 07:28.992
Gram. I thought
you were sleeping in.

07:29.091 --> 07:31.793
I was, just not in my room.

07:32.394 --> 07:34.595
You know what?
We all share way too much.

07:34.596 --> 07:35.964
Oh, I'm sorry, kiddo.

07:35.965 --> 07:38.434
Mwah. But my happiness
cannot be contained.

07:38.735 --> 07:40.035
- Hee! Hee!
- I'm going to school.

07:40.036 --> 07:41.471
- Yes.
- I'm glad you had a nice date.

07:41.472 --> 07:43.306
...Three and four and five.

07:43.907 --> 07:44.674
- I am assuming
- Ah.

07:44.675 --> 07:45.875
from this walk of shame...

07:45.975 --> 07:47.875
that you and your
high sool sweetheart Chet

07:47.976 --> 07:49.877
Had a lovely night
all night talking.

07:50.778 --> 07:52.044
Among other things.

07:52.045 --> 07:53.945
Mm. It's a been a few weeks.

07:54.045 --> 07:55.879
Do I need to sit him down
and ask him his intentions?

07:55.880 --> 07:59.082
I am having way too much fun
to worry about his intentions.

07:59.183 --> 08:02.818
Okay, took me for
lovely candlelight dinner...

08:03.619 --> 08:05.921
Horse and carriage ride
through Central Park,

08:05.922 --> 08:08.623
where we watched the sunrise
over the same boulder

08:08.824 --> 08:11.025
where we shared
our first kiss.

08:11.126 --> 08:12.360
Ahh.

08:12.361 --> 08:14.161
Wait. That's still
his make-out spot?

08:14.261 --> 08:15.494
Mother, that's a red flag.

08:15.495 --> 08:18.697
Honey, nothing you could say
can spoil this for me.

08:18.698 --> 08:20.800
I haven't
felt this way since...

08:20.801 --> 08:23.269
I can't remember when.

08:23.270 --> 08:25.670
Ah, amnesia.
It's going around.

08:25.671 --> 08:27.504
Speaking of which, I'm off.

08:27.905 --> 08:29.105
I'd tell you not to wait up,

08:29.206 --> 08:32.039
But clearly,
there would be no point.

08:32.941 --> 08:34.110
His fingerprints
aren't in the system,

08:34.111 --> 08:36.111
And we don't have any hits
on missing persons.

08:36.313 --> 08:38.813
This is crazy. We actually
find a witness to our murder,

08:38.913 --> 08:41.448
We don't know who he is, and he
doesn't remember what he saw.

08:41.948 --> 08:43.751
- Where are we on Rocco?
- Fink's old assistant?

08:44.052 --> 08:45.520
Uniforms are
bringing him in now.

08:45.721 --> 08:47.721
Ballistics confirms
that the bullets came from

08:47.821 --> 08:48.890
The same gun
as the others.

08:49.091 --> 08:51.194
Whatever happened in
the gallery, he was there.

08:51.195 --> 08:52.195
Not only was he there,

08:52.295 --> 08:53.864
but someone tried
to kill him as well.

08:55.365 --> 08:56.300
Good thing he reads.

08:56.301 --> 08:57.401
Good thing he reads
russian literature.

08:57.701 --> 08:58.905
If the guy was
a Nicholas Sparks' fan,

08:59.006 --> 08:59.608
He'd be dead.

08:59.609 --> 09:01.909
Have CSU check the coat
for gunpowder residue,

09:02.009 --> 09:04.811
Blood, fibers. Maybe it can tell
us what happened that night.

09:04.812 --> 09:06.913
And check photo ID's
on Fink's artists and clients.

09:07.014 --> 09:08.114
You think he might be
on of 'em?

09:08.214 --> 09:09.282
A girl can dream.

09:11.583 --> 09:12.617
- Ah!
- Ooh!

09:13.118 --> 09:13.985
Oh!

09:14.086 --> 09:15.454
I brought you coffee.

09:17.055 --> 09:18.591
Thank you, Castle.

09:20.392 --> 09:22.327
We all have three different
types of memory.

09:22.328 --> 09:24.329
General knowledge,
like language and facts,

09:24.330 --> 09:25.930
is called semantic memory.

09:25.931 --> 09:27.432
Yours doesn't seem
to be affected.

09:27.833 --> 09:30.968
Then there's procedural memory,
also often called muscle memory.

09:31.169 --> 09:33.504
That includes any actions
or skills that you've repeated

09:33.805 --> 09:36.107
Over and over
and formed neural pathways for,

09:36.108 --> 09:37.442
Like, uh, riding a bike.

09:37.443 --> 09:38.677
Now I know yours is intact

09:38.678 --> 09:39.646
because you've been
walking around.

09:39.747 --> 09:40.947
So what's the problem, doc?

09:41.047 --> 09:42.915
The problem
is in episodic memory.

09:43.116 --> 09:45.350
That's any experience
you've ever had...

09:45.351 --> 09:47.752
Conversations,
movies you've seen,

09:47.753 --> 09:50.389
the people in your life,
even your own name.

09:51.690 --> 09:54.090
So, like, if I were
a betting man,

09:54.791 --> 09:57.128
which I have no idea
if I am,

09:58.229 --> 10:01.631
would I put my money
on my memory coming back

10:02.732 --> 10:03.433
Or not?

10:03.934 --> 10:04.801
There's no way to tell.

10:05.602 --> 10:06.903
You might eventually
get it all back

10:06.904 --> 10:09.939
Or none of it
or anything in between.

10:10.640 --> 10:12.074
Do we know why
this would've happened?

10:12.575 --> 10:14.343
He's got a bump
on the back of his head.

10:14.444 --> 10:15.979
It's usually
a blow to the head

10:16.080 --> 10:18.047
coupled with
psychological trauma

10:18.248 --> 10:19.648
which leads to amnesia.

10:19.649 --> 10:20.649
Trauma?

10:20.749 --> 10:22.851
You did get shot.
Could that be it?

10:23.052 --> 10:25.454
If he believed he was
going to die, then sure.

10:25.455 --> 10:28.357
If we took him back
to the scene of the crime,

10:28.358 --> 10:30.226
Could that jog his memory?

10:30.827 --> 10:31.727
Possibly.

10:32.027 --> 10:34.395
But amnesia's
a tricky condition.

10:34.896 --> 10:36.598
I'd like to take him
back to St. Vincent's.

10:36.699 --> 10:38.834
Run some tests and scans,
just to be safe.

10:38.835 --> 10:41.137
Of course. I'll need to ask
a few questions first.

10:43.075 --> 10:44.075
Mister...

10:45.775 --> 10:47.175
I'm sorry. I don't even
know what to call you.

10:48.376 --> 10:49.612
I don't know
what to call me either.

10:50.213 --> 10:52.682
You said his procedural memory
is intact.

10:52.683 --> 10:53.683
Yes.

10:54.950 --> 10:55.951
Sure.

10:56.452 --> 10:57.987
Just sign at the bottom.

11:03.557 --> 11:05.025
That's freaky. How'd I...
how'd I do that?

11:05.026 --> 11:06.495
That looks like
a real signature.

11:06.696 --> 11:07.796
Well, it probably is.

11:07.896 --> 11:09.266
You've signed your name
so many times...

11:09.267 --> 11:11.467
You've formed neural pathways,
procedural memory.

11:11.967 --> 11:14.368
So he can't remember his name,
but he can sign it?

11:14.369 --> 11:15.370
Mysteries of the brain.

11:15.871 --> 11:17.071
It's illegible.

11:17.371 --> 11:18.541
Maybe you're a doctor.

11:18.942 --> 11:20.242
This first initial
looks like a "J."

11:20.342 --> 11:21.310
Does that ring a bell?

11:21.311 --> 11:22.411
No. Unh-unh.

11:22.511 --> 11:24.478
Maybe we should
just call you Jay.

11:28.081 --> 11:30.750
Jay. That's as good
as anything, I guess.

11:33.586 --> 11:35.587
Do you recognize
this man?

11:35.888 --> 11:37.288
No. Should I?

11:37.489 --> 11:38.889
His name is Vctor Fink.

11:39.090 --> 11:40.759
He owned the art gallery
where you were shot.

11:41.460 --> 11:42.460
He was there with me?

11:42.560 --> 11:44.027
He was shot and killed.

11:46.028 --> 11:47.297
God.

11:47.298 --> 11:49.905
What about this man?
Rocco Jones.

11:49.906 --> 11:51.206
He used to work at the gallery.

11:54.641 --> 11:55.643
Guys, I feel so useless.

11:55.644 --> 11:58.446
Look, I'm really...
I'm really sorry.

11:58.447 --> 11:59.715
I-I just don't know him.

12:00.416 --> 12:02.217
After all I did for you, Fink?

12:02.518 --> 12:04.119
I wasn't
just your assistant, man.

12:04.120 --> 12:05.721
I broke the law for you.

12:06.022 --> 12:08.257
And you think
you can just fire me?

12:08.558 --> 12:11.260
I should kill you, man.
Just pop you right in the back.

12:11.261 --> 12:12.428
Bang! And you're dead.

12:12.429 --> 12:15.597
Whew. Wow.

12:15.598 --> 12:20.267
So you finally get the courage
to do it, there, Rocco?

12:20.568 --> 12:21.569
Dude, come on.

12:21.770 --> 12:24.004
I was mad.
I was just blowing off steam.

12:25.205 --> 12:26.607
You said you broke the law
for him.

12:27.708 --> 12:28.075
How?

12:32.213 --> 12:33.747
Fine by me, pal.

12:34.148 --> 12:35.016
You have a nice trial.

12:35.117 --> 12:37.085
Come on. What... what the hell
are you talkg about?

12:37.186 --> 12:38.386
You threatened a guy,

12:38.486 --> 12:39.687
Then he turns up dead.

12:40.088 --> 12:41.655
Do the math.

12:43.256 --> 12:44.691
Forgeries.

12:47.260 --> 12:48.294
Fink paid me

12:48.295 --> 12:50.163
to paint forgeries
of high-end paintings.

12:50.364 --> 12:53.132
Look, I was struggling, man.
I needed the dough.

12:53.333 --> 12:54.868
What'd he do
with the copies?

12:54.869 --> 12:55.903
Sold them.

12:55.904 --> 12:58.372
Passed them along to the buyer
like they were the real thing.

12:59.473 --> 13:00.841
Who did he sell to?

13:02.842 --> 13:03.909
Bahir Harun.

13:04.310 --> 13:06.578
He's an attaché
at the Bahrain consulate.

13:06.679 --> 13:09.280
Bahrain? So he's the one
who talked to Fink

13:09.281 --> 13:10.548
An hour before
he was murdered.

13:10.549 --> 13:12.318
Maybe he figured out
Fink was selling fakes

13:12.319 --> 13:13.287
And decided to get even.

13:13.288 --> 13:16.388
Doesn't matter. The guy has
full diplomatic immunity.

13:16.488 --> 13:17.456
Great.

13:18.257 --> 13:19.925
So I checked
all the photo ID's

13:20.026 --> 13:22.327
of all of Fink's clients
and artists.

13:22.728 --> 13:24.596
Our friend Jay
isn't one of them.

13:24.997 --> 13:26.599
Then what was he doing
at the gallery?

13:26.600 --> 13:27.900
Holloway called from
the hospital.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.501
Aside from a minor head bump,
Jay's got a clean bill of health.

13:30.502 --> 13:31.904
Well,
other than the memory loss.

13:32.505 --> 13:34.106
You know what? Why don't
you guys grab Jay,

13:34.107 --> 13:36.843
take him down to the crime scene,
see if that sparks his memory?

13:37.144 --> 13:39.711
And get ahold of
Fink's assistant Darius.

13:39.912 --> 13:40.847
Tell him
to meet you down there

13:40.848 --> 13:43.082
with every file he has
on Bahir Hharun.

13:50.590 --> 13:52.059
And you're sure
I was here?

13:53.060 --> 13:54.662
Take your time.
No pressure.

13:59.499 --> 14:01.202
Isn't this supposed to be
where I get a headache

14:01.203 --> 14:03.204
and flashes of memory
start overwhelming me

14:03.205 --> 14:05.273
until all the pieces
come together?

14:06.274 --> 14:07.706
Okay, you've seen
too many movies.

14:08.707 --> 14:10.106
Yeah, that I can't remember.

14:10.507 --> 14:13.773
- Wow.
-That's very... chicken/egg.

14:13.774 --> 14:15.141
Welcome to my world.

14:16.042 --> 14:17.076
Weird...

14:17.377 --> 14:21.079
That someone can just
lose his mind like that.

14:21.280 --> 14:22.881
Are you sure you don't recognize him?

14:23.082 --> 14:24.282
I don't think so.

14:24.482 --> 14:25.783
But I've only been here
a few months.

14:26.584 --> 14:29.919
Anyway, here's everything
I could find on Mr. Harun.

14:31.020 --> 14:33.623
All purchases,
going back three years.

14:36.358 --> 14:39.661
I still can't believe Fink
was trafficking in forgeries.

14:40.662 --> 14:42.262
Harun's purchases
from Fink.

14:42.363 --> 14:43.531
That's dozens of paintings.

14:43.532 --> 14:46.132
Yeah, and according to
Fink's old assistant Rocco,

14:46.332 --> 14:48.167
Any and all of these
could've been forgeries.

14:48.268 --> 14:51.036
This is a Jules Matterson.
This is worth $100,000 easy.

14:51.037 --> 14:53.505
Yeah, but you only pay Rocco
a grand to knock it off.

14:53.506 --> 14:55.108
Fink could've ripped Harun off
for millions.

14:55.109 --> 14:56.709
Who says crime doesn't pay?

14:56.909 --> 14:58.010
Someone took me for that much,

14:58.511 --> 15:00.011
I could see putting a bullet
in his back.

15:00.211 --> 15:02.345
Well, that explains
why Harun went after Fink,

15:02.346 --> 15:03.348
but what about Jay?

15:03.349 --> 15:04.349
We need to talk to Harun.

15:04.849 --> 15:06.549
Beckett, I hate
diplomatic immunity

15:06.550 --> 15:07.551
as much as the next cop,

15:07.552 --> 15:10.052
but as far as you're concerned,
forget the guy.

15:10.653 --> 15:11.788
I put in
the interview request.

15:11.789 --> 15:13.590
Now it's in the state
department's hands, period.

15:13.591 --> 15:15.591
Fine, but, sir, what about
the other victim?

15:15.891 --> 15:17.192
The guy with amnesia. So?

15:17.593 --> 15:18.993
He has nowhere
to go tonight.

15:19.093 --> 15:20.461
Well, turn him over
to social services.

15:20.462 --> 15:21.563
It's the state's problem,
not ours.

15:21.764 --> 15:24.264
I know, sir, but he'll probably
end up in a homeless shelter.

15:24.364 --> 15:26.732
He's a person of interest
and a potential witness.

15:26.733 --> 15:28.635
I would hate to lose him
to the system.

15:29.336 --> 15:33.506
Okay.
But my couch is off-limits.

15:33.507 --> 15:35.008
Thank you, sir.

15:36.109 --> 15:37.377
It's not the plaza.

15:37.578 --> 15:40.379
But I have snuck many
a power nap on this couch

15:40.380 --> 15:41.281
over the years.

15:42.282 --> 15:43.583
You should sleep just fine.

15:43.984 --> 15:46.052
I'm grateful not to have to
go anywhere with strangers.

15:46.653 --> 15:47.954
It's not a problem.

15:49.155 --> 15:50.356
You know,
it's terrifying to think

15:50.357 --> 15:51.658
that someone actually tried
to kill me

15:53.159 --> 15:55.294
and I don't know who it was
or why.

15:55.995 --> 15:56.863
And they're still out there.

15:57.664 --> 15:59.265
That's why we're gonna
catch the bastard.

16:00.166 --> 16:02.701
But to do that, we need
to find out who you are.

16:03.202 --> 16:05.236
So we're gonna release
your photograph to the media

16:05.337 --> 16:06.238
tomorrow morning.

16:07.039 --> 16:08.640
And what if
nobody recognizes it?

16:09.641 --> 16:10.609
I'm sure someone will.

16:10.710 --> 16:13.046
But what if no one does
and I don't remember?

16:14.447 --> 16:15.547
Then who am I?

16:19.917 --> 16:21.987
I promise you,
we won't give up on you.

16:26.328 --> 16:27.428
My science teacher says

16:27.429 --> 16:29.129
that chocolate contains chemicals

16:29.198 --> 16:30.865
that are proven
to relieve depression.

16:30.866 --> 16:31.866
Ah, it's good,

16:31.908 --> 16:33.701
But I prefer grape...

16:33.702 --> 16:35.002
aged, bottled and corked.

16:36.402 --> 16:37.702
You're having
an ice cream tasting,

16:37.703 --> 16:39.804
and no one called,
texted or tweeted.

16:39.805 --> 16:40.905
Gram broke it off with Chet.

16:41.205 --> 16:43.373
So I suggested sugar therapy.

16:43.374 --> 16:45.008
What happened to sunrise
in Central Park?

16:45.109 --> 16:47.842
Oh, who am I kidding?
It's a fairy tale.

16:47.943 --> 16:49.910
And what woman doesn't want
a fairy tale?

16:50.011 --> 16:51.712
He's not
who I thought he was.

16:51.713 --> 16:52.713
How so?

16:52.913 --> 16:54.213
Million different
little things... you know,

16:54.214 --> 16:55.816
He doesn't drive, he's skinny,

16:55.817 --> 16:58.618
Oh, and he has this laugh
like... Wah-um.

16:58.719 --> 17:01.154
I can't even do it. It's like
a honking goose kind of...

17:01.155 --> 17:03.090
These are sitcom reasons
for breaking up.

17:03.791 --> 17:06.026
This morning you were in love.
What possibly could've happened?

17:06.027 --> 17:07.127
Dad, back off.

17:07.127 --> 17:08.127
The spark died.

17:09.527 --> 17:10.961
She's obviously
reconsidered.

17:11.061 --> 17:11.762
That's right,

17:11.963 --> 17:15.199
And now we're going through
the five flavors of grieving.

17:15.599 --> 17:18.536
Oh. Is the first stage
accepting the ice cream?

17:18.737 --> 17:20.705
- Exactly.
- Then I'm in.

17:29.881 --> 17:31.216
Hey, morning.

17:31.217 --> 17:33.317
Hey. How was he last night?

17:33.417 --> 17:34.484
He slept like a rock.

17:34.685 --> 17:36.485
Doc Holloway
stopped by this morning

17:36.586 --> 17:38.454
to give him a cognitive
abilities test.

17:38.455 --> 17:40.357
Scored through the roof
on the quantitative part.

17:40.558 --> 17:41.258
He's good at math.

17:41.358 --> 17:43.695
Maybe he was an engineer
or in accounting or financing.

17:43.796 --> 17:45.796
Or just good at math.

17:45.996 --> 17:47.730
Castle is testing
his drawing abilities,

17:47.731 --> 17:49.097
See if he's an artist.

17:49.098 --> 17:50.899
Maybe he was trying toonvince
Fink to show his work.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.268
I suppose we should be thankful
he didn't offer to pose nude.

17:53.269 --> 17:54.869
Yeah, thanks for that.

17:55.169 --> 17:57.539
Hey, any idea if we're gonna get
to talk to that attaché Harun?

17:57.640 --> 17:58.708
Radio silence.

17:59.709 --> 18:02.009
- We gotta ID Jay.
- Yeah.

18:03.409 --> 18:04.212
Speak of the devil.

18:04.213 --> 18:05.713
Yeah, they been showing it
all morning.

18:05.813 --> 18:06.947
- Any calls yet?
- No.

18:07.448 --> 18:10.115
Well, until we figure out
who he is, we've got nothing.

18:11.216 --> 18:12.518
So what's the verdict?

18:18.357 --> 18:19.390
Wow.

18:19.691 --> 18:21.227
You really captured
his soul.

18:22.428 --> 18:24.030
Okay,
so you're not an artist.

18:24.331 --> 18:26.499
I'm sure you have
many other talents.

18:26.700 --> 18:27.901
Just not a talent
for remembering them.

18:28.344 --> 18:29.270
Oh, that's him!

18:29.271 --> 18:30.271
Oh, my god!
That's him!

18:30.272 --> 18:32.072
- Oh, thank god.
- Can I help you?

18:32.171 --> 18:33.474
I think we're about to
find out who you are?

18:33.475 --> 18:34.375
Do you recognize her?

18:34.391 --> 18:35.846
- Yes, it's him.
- No.

18:35.947 --> 18:37.647
but then again, I don't
recognize myself on the mirror.

18:37.747 --> 18:39.547
- Go ahead, ma'am.
- Thanks. Oh, Joel!

18:39.748 --> 18:40.849
Oh, my God.

18:40.850 --> 18:41.850
Mm.

18:42.450 --> 18:43.949
Tory Westchester, wife.

18:45.050 --> 18:47.051
Oh, I was so scared
I lost you.

18:47.210 --> 18:48.587
Oh, sweetie.

18:49.588 --> 18:53.023
So it's true, you really
don't remember anything?

18:53.024 --> 18:54.491
He's suffering
from amnesia.

18:54.592 --> 18:57.029
I knew something was wrong.
I knew it.

18:57.330 --> 18:58.430
Jay, are you cryin?

18:58.830 --> 19:00.531
Uh, I think I am.

19:02.966 --> 19:04.869
Do you feel a connection?

19:04.970 --> 19:06.038
Yeah.

19:06.139 --> 19:07.673
It's actually
pretty overwhelming.

19:08.074 --> 19:10.008
Of course it is, baby.

19:10.509 --> 19:11.709
I love you so much.

19:12.310 --> 19:15.146
We will get through this,
whatever it takes.

19:15.247 --> 19:17.584
Um...Ms. Westchester, how long have
the two of you been married?

19:17.585 --> 19:19.986
Two years
this past October.

19:20.587 --> 19:21.788
And you said his name
was Joel...

19:21.789 --> 19:23.323
Westchester.

19:23.424 --> 19:25.625
Oh, honey, look at you.

19:26.026 --> 19:27.827
You do remember me.

19:28.428 --> 19:30.562
Mm.

19:32.699 --> 19:36.333
Oh, love conquers all!
Oh, it's all going to be fine!

19:36.334 --> 19:37.167
Are you okay?

19:37.168 --> 19:39.269
Oh, what is it?
What is it, my darling?

19:39.370 --> 19:40.437
I think he's having
an asthma attack.

19:40.538 --> 19:42.408
You have an inhaler
in your pocket. Get it.

19:47.610 --> 19:49.478
Ms. Westchester,
do you have cats?

19:49.679 --> 19:51.412
Eight, like Jon and Kate.

19:52.848 --> 19:55.216
I think Joel here
is allergic to cats.

19:55.217 --> 19:56.518
Really?

19:57.719 --> 20:00.488
Ms. Westchester, you're not
really married to him, are you?

20:02.289 --> 20:03.291
I could be.

20:03.592 --> 20:06.395
I so could be. Why the hell
shouldn't I be?!

20:06.496 --> 20:08.431
She's been in and out
of mental facilities

20:08.632 --> 20:10.266
for more than ten years.

20:10.467 --> 20:12.503
Every personality disorder
in the book.

20:13.504 --> 20:14.407
Sorry about that.

20:14.408 --> 20:17.108
Just another contestant on "Who
Wants to Marry an Amnesiac?"

20:17.208 --> 20:20.109
Beckett, your attaché,
Mr. Harun, he's on his way down.

20:20.110 --> 20:21.244
He agreed to talk.

20:25.782 --> 20:27.415
He just showed up
voluntarily?

20:27.416 --> 20:28.618
He wants to stay in control.

20:28.719 --> 20:30.654
This could be our only shot.
Let's make sure that Harun

20:30.655 --> 20:32.023
gets a good look
at our friend Jay.

20:32.024 --> 20:33.424
Inadvertent, of course.

20:33.524 --> 20:35.726
If Harun thinks that he killed
Jay, then his reaction

20:35.827 --> 20:38.363
could tell us everything
we need to know. Let's go.

20:40.764 --> 20:43.633
Mr. Harun, you were a client of Mr. Fink's?

20:43.634 --> 20:44.801
That's correct.

20:45.302 --> 20:47.504
You bought a significant number
of works from him.

20:47.505 --> 20:48.505
Yes.

20:48.605 --> 20:50.908
Well, we believe that many of
those works were forgeries.

20:50.909 --> 20:52.109
Yeah, that's correct.

20:52.209 --> 20:54.777
So you're saying that
you knew they were fakes?

20:55.178 --> 20:57.046
- Of course I knew.
- And you bought them anyway?

20:57.447 --> 21:00.215
I have many friends back home
whose wives are,

21:00.216 --> 21:02.751
How shall we say,
uh, demanding.

21:02.852 --> 21:05.687
And what do demanding wives
have to do with any of this?

21:05.788 --> 21:07.322
Well, we all know
that the fairer sex

21:07.323 --> 21:08.858
can be shallow.

21:09.359 --> 21:11.093
Not you, of course,
Detective...

21:11.194 --> 21:13.028
A smart, liberated
American woman.

21:13.129 --> 21:14.863
But my friends' wives,

21:14.864 --> 21:18.200
they want a bag
that says, um, "Gucci."

21:18.801 --> 21:19.868
They don't care
who made the bag

21:19.969 --> 21:21.904
as long as it has
that signature.

21:22.005 --> 21:23.639
And it's the same
with paintings.

21:23.740 --> 21:26.041
They are more appreciative
of... of the signature

21:26.042 --> 21:27.843
Than of the...
the work itself.

21:27.844 --> 21:29.979
And my friends don't always
want to spend top dollar

21:29.980 --> 21:32.881
on authentic pieces, so Vctor
would commission a copy.

21:32.882 --> 21:35.516
My friends save money,
I get rich...

21:35.517 --> 21:38.552
- Hey, move to your left just a drop.
- and the wives get to think

21:38.353 --> 21:39.696
They have extravagant artwork
on their wall.
Yeah.

21:39.755 --> 21:42.322
Everyone's happy, and no one's
broken the law.
Yeah.

21:42.323 --> 21:44.824
So you only bought fakes from Fink?

21:45.025 --> 21:46.892
No. He would also
source originals

21:46.893 --> 21:49.028
for those husbands with taste.

21:49.729 --> 21:51.830
I was happy to provide, even
though originals pay less...
- He look familiar?

21:51.831 --> 21:54.733
What, with everyone wanting
fair market value and all.
- No, sorry.

21:55.134 --> 21:56.935
The night that Mr. Fink
was murdered,

21:56.936 --> 21:59.104
you called him not long
before he was killed.

21:59.105 --> 22:00.105
That's correct, Detective.

22:00.569 --> 22:02.606
He... he told me to come by,
that he had a painting for me.

22:02.607 --> 22:05.374
I showed up around 9:45,
but he sent me away.

22:05.475 --> 22:06.578
Sent you away?

22:06.779 --> 22:08.879
Yes, he was arguing
with a man.

22:08.979 --> 22:10.713
- About what?
- I have no idea.

22:11.214 --> 22:14.249
I respected his wishes
and went for dinner at Nobu.

22:14.750 --> 22:16.618
Do you think you could
describe this man?

22:17.419 --> 22:18.786
Please.

22:18.787 --> 22:21.456
Must we continue with
this ridiculous charade

22:21.557 --> 22:24.891
When we both know
he is standing right there?

22:28.262 --> 22:30.397
Now if that is all...

22:30.398 --> 22:31.867
Mr. Harun,
I'm not quite done yet.

22:32.668 --> 22:34.936
Ah, but I am.

22:36.237 --> 22:38.138
Have a nice day.

22:40.539 --> 22:41.607
Thanks.

22:41.608 --> 22:43.042
For a guy with
diplomatic immunity,

22:43.043 --> 22:44.412
He wasn't very diplomatic.

22:44.513 --> 22:46.147
Harun's hiding behind
his immunity.

22:46.148 --> 22:47.183
He knows more
than he's saying.

22:47.284 --> 22:48.184
Maybe.

22:48.284 --> 22:49.418
But his alibi is good.

22:49.719 --> 22:53.021
Nobu has him on security video
entering at 9:55 pm,

22:53.022 --> 22:55.924
19 minutes before the 911 call
about shots fired.

22:56.025 --> 22:56.993
He's not our guy.

22:56.994 --> 22:58.194
Well, just because
he didn't pull the trigger

22:58.294 --> 22:59.629
doesn't mean he wasn't involved.

22:59.630 --> 23:00.630
And just because Jay was shot

23:00.672 --> 23:02.398
doesn't mean he wasn't
into something shady.

23:02.799 --> 23:03.968
It could be the reason
he was shot.

23:04.169 --> 23:06.169
Harun said he saw Jay
arguing with Fink.

23:06.569 --> 23:08.441
We need to figure out
why Jay was at the gallery.

23:08.642 --> 23:11.242
And we can't do that if we
don't know who the hell he is.

23:11.642 --> 23:13.076
We've been through this.
It's just a bunch of junk.

23:13.077 --> 23:14.178
But if we take a look
at everything

23:14.179 --> 23:17.115
we know about him collectively,
maybe a picture will emerge.

23:20.016 --> 23:21.284
Nothing distinctive
about these keys.

23:21.285 --> 23:23.521
Yeah, and that plastic bag
really narrows it down.

23:23.522 --> 23:24.622
Okay, he's got asthma

23:24.822 --> 23:27.590
He's allergic to cats,
he reads...

23:27.591 --> 23:29.392
And he's good at math
and he can't draw.

23:29.393 --> 23:31.462
Put it together,
he's your average asthmatic mathlete

23:31.463 --> 23:32.864
with a lot of crap
in his pocket.

23:32.865 --> 23:33.865
Detective.

23:34.165 --> 23:35.166
Thank you.

23:35.767 --> 23:36.667
It's from Lanie.

23:36.767 --> 23:38.536
It's the forensics report
on his coat.

23:38.537 --> 23:40.905
Maybe his driver's license
was sewn into the lining.

23:42.106 --> 23:43.373
Gunpowder residue.

23:43.374 --> 23:44.675
So he was shot
at close range

23:44.676 --> 23:47.411
Mm-hmm. Coffee stains,ugar
granules, traces of milk.

23:47.512 --> 23:48.847
Well, we know how he takes
his coffee.

23:48.848 --> 23:49.848
Animal hairs.

23:49.948 --> 23:51.149
Not cat hairs.

23:51.950 --> 23:53.252
How could I have missed this?

23:53.553 --> 23:54.153
Missed what?

23:54.195 --> 23:56.486
- Do you know what this is?
- Yeah, it's a grocery bag.

23:56.487 --> 23:57.655
No, it's not
just a grocery bag.

23:57.656 --> 24:01.323
It's the bag that's gonna
tell us exactly who Jay is.

24:03.547 --> 24:06.182
Why are you dragging me
back to the art gallery?

24:06.183 --> 24:08.817
Not to the art gallery,
to the street. Ah, it's gone.

24:08.818 --> 24:09.818
What's gone?

24:09.860 --> 24:11.553
The dog. That's why
he had the bag,

24:11.554 --> 24:12.622
To clean up after his dog.

24:12.623 --> 24:13.823
How do you know
it was his dog?

24:13.923 --> 24:15.158
Well, why else
would he have a bag?

24:15.259 --> 24:16.959
Why else would there be
a dog tied up

24:16.960 --> 24:18.328
outside a commercial building
after midnight?

24:18.529 --> 24:19.829
Maybe someone stole it.

24:21.630 --> 24:22.330
Get me Animal Control.

24:22.430 --> 24:26.031
All the canines with ID tags
we picked up in the last 24.

24:26.032 --> 24:28.167
Mostly their owners
lost 'em accidentally

24:28.168 --> 24:29.337
and are relieved when we call.

24:29.838 --> 24:30.838
Castle.

24:31.538 --> 24:34.606
Oh. Who's a good girl?

24:34.607 --> 24:37.275
That one's from
148 West 26th.

24:37.376 --> 24:38.376
That's Fink's gallery.

24:38.377 --> 24:39.377
Good girl.

24:39.477 --> 24:40.876
Lucy.

24:40.977 --> 24:42.510
Your name
is Jeremy Preswick.

24:42.711 --> 24:44.377
We checked it against
your DMV photo,

24:44.378 --> 24:46.946
- and it's a positive ID.
- Jeremy Preswick.

24:46.947 --> 24:48.481
You are 34 years old,

24:48.482 --> 24:51.683
and you live at
82 Warren Street in Tribeca.

24:51.784 --> 24:53.084
You don't really have
any family.

24:53.585 --> 24:55.419
Your parents passed away
a few years ago,

24:55.420 --> 24:56.787
and you don't have
any siblings.

24:56.888 --> 25:00.390
But we did manage to get ahold
of your ex-wife, Emma Carnes.

25:00.791 --> 25:02.091
- Ex-wife?
- Uh-huh.

25:02.433 --> 25:04.425
- I'm divorced?
- Yeah.

25:05.427 --> 25:06.360
Sorry.

25:06.361 --> 25:09.564
Your ex sounded
pretty concerned.

25:09.865 --> 25:11.532
And we figured that would be
the fastest way

25:11.533 --> 25:12.833
of putting together
the details,

25:12.834 --> 25:15.535
which would be great for you
and for our investigation.

25:16.536 --> 25:17.805
If you think it'll help.

25:17.906 --> 25:20.573
Okay.

25:21.574 --> 25:23.642
I have an ex-wife
that I can't remember.

25:24.243 --> 25:27.012
Hey, some men
would consider you lucky.

25:29.013 --> 25:30.713
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

25:37.589 --> 25:40.591
Hey. Thank you for coming.
I appreciate it.

25:40.792 --> 25:41.926
Sure.

25:43.127 --> 25:44.529
So we're divorced.

25:46.830 --> 25:47.764
Yeah.

25:48.565 --> 25:50.835
Must be weird, coming here
to try to help me out, huh?

25:53.036 --> 25:53.970
A little.

25:54.171 --> 25:55.472
Please take a seat.

25:59.408 --> 26:01.176
So what happened to him?

26:01.677 --> 26:04.211
That's what we are trying
to figure out.

26:04.412 --> 26:06.177
Is there anything you
can tell us about Jeremy?

26:06.378 --> 26:07.276
Well, like what?

26:07.277 --> 26:09.677
Like, uh, where he works.

26:09.978 --> 26:12.080
Well, as far as I know,
he doesn't anymore.

26:13.181 --> 26:15.283
Okay, this is weird with you
sitting right there.

26:15.484 --> 26:17.084
Tell me about it.

26:18.752 --> 26:20.853
You have a Phd in Economics
from Wharton.

26:21.454 --> 26:23.589
Uh, you had
a consulting business

26:23.590 --> 26:25.258
in Channel Economics
and Strategy.

26:27.328 --> 26:28.328
You're smart.

26:29.328 --> 26:31.095
Like, crazy smart.

26:31.496 --> 26:32.796
Had a business?

26:32.897 --> 26:34.965
Yeah, yeah,
he sold it last year.

26:34.966 --> 26:35.966
Do you know why?

26:36.008 --> 26:38.601
No. I thought it was weird.
He loved the business.

26:39.102 --> 26:40.302
Why'd we split up?

26:43.372 --> 26:44.806
Wow.

26:44.807 --> 26:47.142
I've ranted for hours
to girlfriends about that.

26:47.945 --> 26:49.703
I'm guessing I don't
come off so well in that rant.

26:52.079 --> 26:53.381
You were a jerk.

26:53.782 --> 26:54.649
Ah.

26:56.450 --> 26:57.417
But so was I.

26:58.218 --> 26:59.052
I mean, the truth is,

26:59.053 --> 27:00.453
we probably
got married too young.

27:05.724 --> 27:07.924
Look, I'm sorry
that I don't recognize you.

27:08.925 --> 27:11.061
but you seem incredibly nice
and you're gorgeous,

27:11.062 --> 27:13.029
and I'm certain that it was
entirely my fault

27:13.030 --> 27:15.264
that our marriage fell apart.

27:15.265 --> 27:16.265
See? That.

27:16.365 --> 27:17.532
That's...

27:17.533 --> 27:18.733
The guy
I fell in love with...

27:19.134 --> 27:21.368
Funny, sweet,
self-deprecating.

27:22.069 --> 27:23.470
Hey.

27:23.671 --> 27:24.405
Do you know what Jeremy

27:24.406 --> 27:26.107
had been doing
with himself recently?

27:26.608 --> 27:27.608
As far as I know,

27:27.708 --> 27:29.776
he was dating the youngest,
hottest women he could find

27:29.777 --> 27:31.745
and not bothering to put
the toilet seat down.

27:34.146 --> 27:36.215
And do you have any idea
what he might have been doing

27:36.316 --> 27:38.552
at the Vctor Fink Gallery
in Chelsea?

27:38.753 --> 27:41.222
No, I'm sorry. But we haven't
even spoken in almost a year.

27:42.423 --> 27:44.624
Um, well, we're on our way
to Jeremy's apartment

27:44.625 --> 27:45.725
to see if it sparks anything.

27:45.726 --> 27:46.960
Would you mind
coming along?

27:47.361 --> 27:49.097
You might be able to put
things in some context.

28:00.504 --> 28:01.404
Look familiar?

28:02.105 --> 28:03.372
Nope.

28:03.473 --> 28:06.308
You can say it.
I'm the worst witness ever.

28:07.109 --> 28:08.243
Ah, you're doing fine.

28:09.044 --> 28:10.145
Hmm.

28:11.546 --> 28:12.480
A wallet.

28:13.181 --> 28:14.551
Well, I don't think
you were mugged.

28:16.052 --> 28:18.255
Do you mind if I poke around,
open some drawers?

28:18.356 --> 28:20.525
<i>Mi casa que no recuerdo
es tu casa.</i>

28:20.526 --> 28:23.460
Hey, look at that.
Rockin' the spanish.

28:23.461 --> 28:25.194
We did junior year
in Madrid.

28:26.595 --> 28:27.495
That sounds nice.

28:27.595 --> 28:29.963
Here's the rest of your
Russian literature collection.

28:30.964 --> 28:33.800
You are a very ambitious reader,
Mr. Preswick.

28:34.401 --> 28:35.969
You always wanted more time
to read.

28:36.470 --> 28:38.073
I guess I'm gonna have to
start over now.

28:38.274 --> 28:39.842
Ah, it's not such a bad thing.

28:40.243 --> 28:42.846
What I wouldn't give to read
"The Cask of Amontillado"

28:42.847 --> 28:45.215
for the first time...
Or any Stephen King.

28:45.516 --> 28:48.318
Ah, silver lining...
you get to read all my books

28:48.319 --> 28:49.754
for the first time again.

28:52.255 --> 28:53.255
Anything?

28:54.256 --> 28:55.224
It's pretty sparse.

28:55.525 --> 28:57.659
Like a guy who spent
a lot of time alone.

28:57.860 --> 29:00.529
Yeah, I thought you'd have
more of a slick pad

29:00.730 --> 29:02.064
Done up with more stuff.

29:02.265 --> 29:04.065
Hey. Taglia.

29:04.066 --> 29:05.835
This is
a pretty pricey painting.

29:06.336 --> 29:08.470
Emma, do you know if jeremy
bought that painting

29:08.471 --> 29:09.740
at a gallery in the city?

29:10.741 --> 29:11.741
No, we...

29:11.841 --> 29:13.443
bought that together
on our honeymoon in Siena.

29:14.444 --> 29:15.579
I can't believe
you still have it.

29:16.580 --> 29:17.538
Why?

29:17.580 --> 29:18.482
Well, part of
the divorce settlement

29:18.483 --> 29:21.084
was to sell it
and split the cash.

29:21.185 --> 29:24.621
It appraised for over 200 grand.
You sent me my half.

29:25.122 --> 29:26.155
That's funny.

29:27.456 --> 29:29.525
There's something about it
that's so familiar.

29:30.726 --> 29:32.095
Or maybe I just like it.

29:32.596 --> 29:33.829
Castle.

29:39.434 --> 29:40.702
It's a 9 millimeter...

29:44.205 --> 29:45.605
With five bullets missing.

29:53.022 --> 29:54.055
So ballistics confirmed

29:54.056 --> 29:55.691
that the gun found
in Jeremy's apartment

29:55.692 --> 29:57.392
was the same one that was used
to kill Fink,

29:57.393 --> 29:59.394
and we just to need to know

29:59.395 --> 30:01.464
If it's possible
that Jeremy was the shooter.

30:01.565 --> 30:03.865
CSU did find gun residue
on his coat.

30:04.065 --> 30:06.533
Well, that just means that
he was shot at close range.

30:06.534 --> 30:09.101
Like if Jeremy
were holding the gun,

30:09.202 --> 30:12.370
struggled with Fink, Fink
managed to turn the gun around

30:12.371 --> 30:13.363
and it went off?

30:13.406 --> 30:15.107
Well, these abrasions
on Fink's wrists

30:15.108 --> 30:16.543
are certainly
consistent with that.

30:16.544 --> 30:18.344
Well, then why would he have
left the gun in his apartment?

30:18.444 --> 30:20.545
Doc Holloway said he was
probably in a fugue state,

30:20.546 --> 30:23.147
like sleepwalking.
He could've dropped the gun off

30:23.148 --> 30:24.249
and then went back out again.

30:25.450 --> 30:26.950
Okay, am I
missing something?

30:27.150 --> 30:28.117
I thought you were
supposed to be happy

30:28.318 --> 30:29.318
after you caught the killer.

30:31.519 --> 30:33.453
Why'd I do it?

30:34.054 --> 30:35.022
We don't know why.

30:36.223 --> 30:37.257
You'll be appointed a lawyer.

30:37.258 --> 30:39.393
I know that Emma wants
to help hire someone,

30:39.394 --> 30:41.094
and I don't think money
will be an issue.

30:42.695 --> 30:44.462
Well, thank you.

30:45.263 --> 30:46.864
I don't know why you're
thanking me, Mr. Preswick.

30:46.965 --> 30:48.267
We just arrested you
for murder.

30:48.368 --> 30:49.668
Yeah, well,
it's not your fault.

30:50.468 --> 30:52.002
You guys have been nothing
but incredibly nice

30:52.903 --> 30:55.572
to a babbling idiot who thought
he was a victim.

30:55.573 --> 30:56.676
It's like I tricked you.

30:57.677 --> 30:59.178
Good luck, Jeremy.

31:06.019 --> 31:07.320
Hey...

31:07.321 --> 31:08.856
If you figure it out,
would you let me know?

31:10.057 --> 31:11.558
Of course.

31:11.659 --> 31:14.461
I just think it would be easier
knowing why.

31:33.880 --> 31:36.849
The guy is guilty of a murder
he can't remember.

31:38.550 --> 31:39.685
That just sucks.

31:40.386 --> 31:42.588
I mean, if you're gonna
kill someone, get caught,

31:42.589 --> 31:44.224
spend the rest of your life
in prison, at least you have

31:44.225 --> 31:46.126
the satisfaction of knowing
why you did it...

31:46.627 --> 31:49.995
Hatred, revenge, hell, maybe
even cut you off on the highway, but...

31:51.496 --> 31:53.798
Jeremy won't even have that
even if we do find motive

31:53.799 --> 31:55.767
because he won't remember
why it meant anything to him.

31:57.268 --> 31:59.036
I'm with you, Castle.
It sucks.

32:01.037 --> 32:02.405
So what next?

32:02.406 --> 32:04.607
We, uh, submit the paperwork
to the DA.

32:04.608 --> 32:06.542
But the DA.
will need motive, right?

32:06.543 --> 32:08.679
No. Evidence speaks.

32:09.380 --> 32:10.480
Smoking gun.

32:10.481 --> 32:12.750
But don't you want to know
why he did it?

32:12.951 --> 32:15.222
Yeah, but the truth is,
is that we don't need it.

32:15.823 --> 32:17.857
The DA doesn't need it.

32:18.058 --> 32:19.492
But you and me?

32:20.593 --> 32:23.028
I know I couldn't sleep
last night. Could you?

32:25.864 --> 32:27.532
There's gotta be
an answer here,

32:27.533 --> 32:29.935
something in his life
that makes it all make sense.

32:34.639 --> 32:35.639
- Hands! Show 'em.
- Ooh!

32:37.042 --> 32:38.842
Oh, that gets
the heart rate going.

32:38.942 --> 32:41.309
Ms. Carnes,
what are you doing here?

32:41.310 --> 32:42.611
Getting Lucy's things.

32:43.812 --> 32:45.514
Prescription.
Mm.

32:45.715 --> 32:47.550
I guess
I have custody now.

32:48.351 --> 32:51.321
I'm sorry to surprise you.
We didn't know you'd be here.

32:54.923 --> 32:56.258
Are you okay?

32:57.260 --> 32:58.360
Yeah.

32:58.401 --> 33:00.693
I guess I just thought
for half a second

33:00.694 --> 33:03.962
that this would be a bizarre
second chance for Jer and me.

33:04.063 --> 33:04.863
Stupid, right?

33:04.864 --> 33:06.566
No, it's not stupid.

33:06.567 --> 33:08.801
And to find out
that he's a murderer...

33:09.802 --> 33:11.869
When I saw him again, I...

33:12.370 --> 33:15.137
All those years of petty
arguments that tore us apart

33:15.138 --> 33:16.140
didn't seem to matter.

33:17.241 --> 33:18.208
It was... it was like
we first met.

33:18.309 --> 33:20.576
You know, I felt that thing.

33:21.577 --> 33:25.646
And then we came here and I saw
that he didn't sell it,

33:25.647 --> 33:28.516
and I thought maybe he still
had feelings for me, too.

33:28.617 --> 33:30.351
Do you mean the painting
that you two of you bought

33:30.352 --> 33:31.121
on your honeymoon?

33:31.322 --> 33:34.222
Yeah, we didn't buy it because
we wanted to. We had to.

33:34.322 --> 33:36.958
We were in the artist's studio
in Siena

33:38.359 --> 33:40.895
and Jeremy picked it up
off the easel.

33:41.196 --> 33:44.431
He was always goofing around.
The artist went crazy.

33:44.532 --> 33:45.766
It was still drying.

33:45.767 --> 33:49.203
We laughed for a week
about our little love smudge.

33:49.204 --> 33:51.239
And then when I saw that
he didn't sell it, I thought,

33:51.940 --> 33:53.008
Maybe...

33:55.609 --> 33:57.177
But I was kidding myself.

33:57.678 --> 33:58.912
What do you mean?

33:59.213 --> 34:01.215
No thumbprint.
It should be right here.

34:02.416 --> 34:04.751
He sold ours.
This one's just a copy.

34:04.752 --> 34:06.386
Ms. Carnes,
are you sure?

34:06.387 --> 34:07.854
Of course I'm sure.

34:07.855 --> 34:09.322
It's a fake.

34:09.422 --> 34:11.824
And we know
who dealt in fakes.

34:11.824 --> 34:14.060
That's gotta be
Jeremy's connection to Fink.

34:14.061 --> 34:16.027
That's gotta be why Jeremy
was at the gallery.

34:16.228 --> 34:18.364
And if Jeremy and Fink were
arguing like Harun said,

34:18.366 --> 34:19.801
maybe it was over
the original.

34:19.802 --> 34:21.802
And if that's a fake,
then where is the original?

34:23.938 --> 34:25.672
Absolutely, and, uh...

34:25.773 --> 34:26.741
Careful with that one.

34:27.742 --> 34:29.943
Oui. Oui, merci.
À bientôt.

34:31.646 --> 34:33.947
Leaving us so soon,
Mr. Harun?

34:34.047 --> 34:36.516
Oh, what now?
I have a plane to catch.

34:36.617 --> 34:38.520
Make any interesting art
acquisitions on this trip?

34:38.821 --> 34:40.221
Actually, yes.

34:40.321 --> 34:41.489
Mind if we take a look?

34:41.491 --> 34:42.991
I'm sorry.
I just don't have the time.

34:43.091 --> 34:43.927
Make time.

34:43.928 --> 34:46.228
What part
of "diplomatic immunity"

34:46.728 --> 34:48.196
are you not clear on?

34:48.897 --> 34:50.398
See, every time you say
something like that,

34:50.399 --> 34:52.434
it makes me think that
you have something to hide.

34:53.335 --> 34:55.437
It's too bad that you will
never find out.

34:57.238 --> 34:58.873
License and registration,
please.

34:58.874 --> 35:00.676
What? Why?

35:00.677 --> 35:01.613
You are double parked.

35:02.414 --> 35:04.114
This is New York.
Everyone double parks.

35:04.214 --> 35:06.682
- Is he resisting arrest?
- I believe so.

35:06.683 --> 35:08.384
- Step over here.
- Oh.

35:09.185 --> 35:10.353
We're gonna have to
search your car.

35:11.754 --> 35:13.519
You have no right
to do this.

35:13.720 --> 35:15.887
I don't see
any diplomatic plates.

35:17.088 --> 35:20.057
And immunity doesn't extend
to a car service.

35:29.067 --> 35:30.802
Mr. Harun, this can go
one of two ways,

35:30.803 --> 35:32.938
You can either cooperate
and tell me what I need to know

35:32.939 --> 35:34.207
or I can call
the State Department

35:34.208 --> 35:36.009
and inform them that you have
a piece artwork

35:36.110 --> 35:37.746
that's at the center of
our murder investigation.

35:37.747 --> 35:39.947
And the last I checked,
the New York tabloids

35:40.047 --> 35:42.849
could give a rat's ass
about your diplomatic status.

35:43.150 --> 35:44.418
They'll just print
your photograph with a headline

35:44.519 --> 35:45.854
that says
"diplomatic douche bag."

35:46.155 --> 35:49.155
Fine. What would
you like to know?

35:49.255 --> 35:51.057
There's a fake version
of this painting

35:51.058 --> 35:53.259
found in one of our
shooting victim's apartments.

35:53.260 --> 35:54.296
Can you tell us
how it got there?

35:54.297 --> 35:55.397
How would I know this?

35:55.497 --> 35:56.731
Because the fake painting

35:56.732 --> 35:58.067
is where the real painting
used to be

35:58.168 --> 35:59.803
and now you have
the real painting.

36:00.004 --> 36:02.304
All I know is that
I asked Fink to acquire it

36:02.804 --> 36:05.306
For a client of mine.
When he said he had it,

36:05.307 --> 36:08.710
I assumed he'd tracked down
the owner and made a deal.

36:08.711 --> 36:11.514
But when I went to the gallery
that evening, he sent me away,

36:12.015 --> 36:13.416
Just like I told you.

36:13.417 --> 36:15.251
That's a great story, Mr. Harun,

36:15.252 --> 36:17.420
but if Fink
sent you away empty-handed,

36:17.721 --> 36:19.157
why do you have the painting?

36:19.158 --> 36:21.258
Because I got a call
from a man this morning

36:21.358 --> 36:23.659
that said he had it
for a price.

36:23.660 --> 36:24.790
Who was it?

36:24.991 --> 36:27.323
It was Fink's new assistant
Darius.

36:28.524 --> 36:29.791
This is crazy.

36:30.092 --> 36:31.025
I told you already,

36:31.026 --> 36:33.457
I was in class
when Mr. Fink was killed.

36:33.558 --> 36:34.924
Nobody remembers
seeing you there.

36:34.925 --> 36:36.125
I sat in the back.

36:36.225 --> 36:37.759
The naughty kids
always do.

36:37.760 --> 36:39.627
You were at the gallery
the night that Jeremy

36:39.628 --> 36:41.495
confronted Fink
about the painting.

36:41.596 --> 36:45.399
Listen, there's obviously been
some kind of misunderstanding.

36:45.500 --> 36:46.966
Was this a misunderstanding
as well?

36:50.035 --> 36:52.736
It's a signed statement from
the super at Preswick's building

36:52.737 --> 36:55.372
admitting that he took
a $1,000 bribe from you

36:55.373 --> 36:57.074
to allow you
into Jeremy's apartment

36:57.075 --> 36:58.775
So that you could switch out
the paintings.

36:59.276 --> 37:02.344
I'm sorry. Shoulda come clean
from the start.

37:04.645 --> 37:05.814
Fink wanted the painting.

37:06.515 --> 37:07.549
He told me
to buy it from Preswick,

37:07.550 --> 37:09.183
but the guy wouldn't sell.

37:09.884 --> 37:11.319
So Fink had me paint a fake.

37:12.420 --> 37:15.690
And, yeah, I-I bribed
the super to...

37:17.491 --> 37:18.592
Switch it
with the real thing.

37:19.493 --> 37:20.593
It was stupid,

37:20.594 --> 37:23.364
But... Fink threatened
to fire me if I didn't.

37:23.365 --> 37:25.669
It was all you, Darius.

37:25.670 --> 37:28.405
You switched out the paintings,
you pocketed the money

37:28.506 --> 37:29.874
That Fink gave you
to buy it.

37:29.875 --> 37:32.144
It was Fink.
He manipulated me.

37:32.145 --> 37:35.481
No, that is just a lie.

37:35.582 --> 37:38.522
And you know what else
is a lie? Your name.

37:40.323 --> 37:42.160
Darius Langley
is your roommate.

37:42.961 --> 37:44.629
Pretty smart,
using his identity

37:44.630 --> 37:45.798
to land a job
at the gallery.

37:45.899 --> 37:47.734
Though I guess it'd be
pretty tough to get hired

37:47.735 --> 37:50.102
with two felony counts
of counterfeiting, though,

37:50.203 --> 37:51.304
Isn't it, George?

37:51.505 --> 37:53.639
You've got quite
a rap sheet, Mr. Heller.

37:54.440 --> 37:58.142
Hmm. One more strike,
you go away for a long time.

37:58.243 --> 38:00.644
Which is why you couldn't afford
Preswick calling the cops

38:00.645 --> 38:02.913
when he found out the truth,
and so you shot him.

38:03.514 --> 38:05.616
And then when he went down,
you shot Fink as well.

38:07.617 --> 38:09.253
You think you' gonna
pin this murder on me?

38:11.296 --> 38:12.255
No way.

38:12.556 --> 38:13.624
You don't got jack.

38:15.325 --> 38:16.660
Read carefully.

38:16.661 --> 38:19.329
You bribed the super...
twice.

38:19.830 --> 38:22.232
and the second time
was four hours after

38:22.233 --> 38:25.102
Detectives Ryan and Esposito
brought Preswick to the gallery

38:25.203 --> 38:27.105
and you realized
that he had lost his memory.

38:28.406 --> 38:30.241
You planted the gun.

38:31.042 --> 38:31.976
Swing and a miss.

38:32.577 --> 38:34.912
Strike three. You're out.

38:38.716 --> 38:40.651
Ah, it's a beaut.

38:40.952 --> 38:43.519
- Isn't it?
- I especially love the fingerprint.

38:43.620 --> 38:46.122
Me, too.
Even if I can't remember,

38:46.223 --> 38:48.524
it still somehow feels
a part of me.

38:52.495 --> 38:53.562
Hey, Jer.

38:54.163 --> 38:55.365
Ready to rock?

38:56.466 --> 38:57.633
Thanks for coming.

38:57.634 --> 38:58.801
You remember Lucy?

38:59.802 --> 39:00.503
No.

39:00.504 --> 39:01.938
She certainly remembers you.

39:03.939 --> 39:05.174
Well, hey, thanks, guys.

39:05.475 --> 39:07.743
You made getting arrested
for murder really not so bad.

39:09.244 --> 39:10.645
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

39:10.846 --> 39:12.548
So are you two gonna...

39:12.849 --> 39:13.849

39:14.249 --> 39:16.551
It's okay.
The answer is...

39:16.652 --> 39:18.519
Who knows? I like him
and he likes me.

39:18.520 --> 39:20.754
- And right now, that's enough.
- Well, see you.

39:20.955 --> 39:23.358
I guess if I ever lose my memory
again, I'll know where to come.

39:26.394 --> 39:29.263
Right.
