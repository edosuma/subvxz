00:01.267 --> 00:03.469
<i>Thanks for
downloading this fox show.</i>

00:03.471 --> 00:05.704
<i>And don't miss
all-new episodes on fox.</i>

00:06.939 --> 00:08.941
<i>Previously on sleepy hollow...</i>

00:08.943 --> 00:10.342
<i>He's lost his connection
to our world.</i>

00:10.344 --> 00:11.543
He needs an anchor.

00:11.545 --> 00:12.678
<i>Mom? You know the man you drew,</i>

00:12.680 --> 00:13.879
<i>Mr. crane?</i>

00:13.881 --> 00:14.947
If you could tell him anything,

00:14.949 --> 00:16.347
<i>what would you say?</i>

00:16.350 --> 00:17.850
Don't ever give up hope.

00:17.852 --> 00:20.119
<i>Hope, hope, hope...</i>

00:20.121 --> 00:21.720
<i>What did you hear?</i>

00:21.722 --> 00:22.855
Molly's voice.

00:22.857 --> 00:25.891
I sold my soul to the devil.

00:25.893 --> 00:28.727
It's a tactic a lot of people
at the top of the pyramid use.

00:28.729 --> 00:29.728
Play the odd bird.

00:29.730 --> 00:31.697
<i>Hide your true intentions.</i>

00:31.699 --> 00:33.198
<i>I've located the map
of the ley lines.</i>

00:33.200 --> 00:35.601
<i>The wellsprings where
their power converges.</i>

00:37.570 --> 00:39.905
<i>Someone is procuring
mystical artifacts.</i>

00:39.907 --> 00:41.473
Where are we
with the next talisman?

00:41.475 --> 00:42.808
Still tracking it.

00:42.810 --> 00:44.376
All these lovely puzzle pieces.

00:52.553 --> 00:56.288
Do you want the pain to stop?

00:58.491 --> 01:00.259
Do you want to purge the guilt

01:00.261 --> 01:02.061
weighing you down in that chair?

01:02.063 --> 01:04.897
Brother, all of your burdens

01:04.899 --> 01:06.899
will be lifted by the power

01:06.901 --> 01:10.069
of the everliving rock.

01:18.078 --> 01:21.580
Yes, yes.

01:26.086 --> 01:28.253
My god.

01:28.255 --> 01:30.923
I can feel my legs.

01:30.925 --> 01:33.459
Now remember,

01:33.461 --> 01:36.028
only those who give,

01:36.030 --> 01:38.597
and give generously,

01:38.599 --> 01:39.998
shall receive.

01:44.105 --> 01:45.771
Hallelujah!

01:50.210 --> 01:51.810
Hurry up.

01:51.812 --> 01:53.445
I got a date.

01:53.447 --> 01:55.714
Now, that's a miracle.

01:57.817 --> 02:00.052
Pouring it on a little thick
with the hug, don't you think?

02:00.054 --> 02:02.688
Worked, didn't it?

02:04.724 --> 02:06.892
Next show is at 9:00.

02:06.894 --> 02:09.061
Don't be late again.

02:11.464 --> 02:13.298
You don't even realize

02:13.300 --> 02:15.134
what you have, do you?

02:16.636 --> 02:18.403
Whoa, whoa.

02:18.405 --> 02:20.906
You... you shouldn't be in here.

02:20.908 --> 02:22.508
We're closed.

02:22.510 --> 02:25.811
Mortals... so focused
on their petty desires.

02:25.813 --> 02:28.747
Never seeing...
The bigger picture.

02:28.749 --> 02:29.815
Back off there, bud.

02:29.817 --> 02:31.583
Never recognizing

02:31.585 --> 02:33.585
when they're in the presence...

02:33.587 --> 02:36.321
Of true power.

02:36.323 --> 02:38.924
Can I get an amen?

02:40.693 --> 02:42.661
Power can be lost,

02:42.663 --> 02:45.164
go missing for centuries,
then turn up

02:45.166 --> 02:46.999
in the unlikeliest of places.

02:47.001 --> 02:48.867
But in the end...

02:48.869 --> 02:51.603
Power can never remain hidden.

02:51.605 --> 02:55.174
Not to those deserving enough
to wield it.

02:56.844 --> 02:59.411
You are not deserving!

03:12.058 --> 03:14.860
Malcolm, I've secured
the third talisman.

03:14.862 --> 03:16.862
I'll see you in the morning.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.699
"Don't fight the pain.

03:20.701 --> 03:22.067
"Surrender

03:22.069 --> 03:24.269
to it."

03:26.906 --> 03:29.575
You told me that once.

03:29.577 --> 03:31.376
Remember?

03:57.337 --> 04:00.973
I learned so much from you
and your friends in hell.

04:03.243 --> 04:06.845
Time to put
those lessons to use.

04:09.916 --> 04:13.185
The third-century celts
were the most fearsome

04:13.187 --> 04:15.921
and bloodthirsty warriors
in all britannia.

04:15.923 --> 04:18.423
Savage to their
barbarian hearts,

04:18.425 --> 04:21.426
they laid waste
to all who challenged them,

04:21.428 --> 04:24.263
including one Danish prince

04:24.265 --> 04:27.766
foolish enough
to cross hadrian's wall.

04:27.768 --> 04:30.302
He was defeated, of course...

04:30.304 --> 04:33.038
And decapitated.

04:33.040 --> 04:35.207
The Celtic chieftains
allowed their men

04:35.209 --> 04:38.443
to lustily kick his head around
for enjoyment.

04:38.445 --> 04:41.546
And from these gruesome origins
grew the sporting endeavor

04:41.548 --> 04:43.882
you modern-day warriors
refer to...

04:43.884 --> 04:46.351
As soccer.

04:48.154 --> 04:50.222
Cool! Thank you.

04:50.224 --> 04:51.823
What did they do
with the head after?

04:51.825 --> 04:53.492
Did they empty his brains
before they played?

04:53.494 --> 04:54.726
And what about the eyes?

04:54.728 --> 04:57.296
Did they pop out
when they kicked it?

04:57.298 --> 04:59.131
- Most likely.
- Okay, that is enough

04:59.133 --> 05:01.900
of a... pep talk
from our friend.

05:01.902 --> 05:03.635
Say, "thank you, Mr. crane."

05:03.637 --> 05:05.671
Thank you, Mr. crane.

05:05.673 --> 05:09.308
To a swift victory,
team Bumblebee.

05:14.847 --> 05:16.848
Well, that was a spirited,
rousing match.

05:16.850 --> 05:18.750
Not as spirited
as your cheering.

05:18.752 --> 05:20.319
What was that we were shouting?

05:20.321 --> 05:22.321
"Creep, creep"?
Qweep, qweep, qweep!

05:23.856 --> 05:25.691
That's the sound of a
white-breasted nuthatch

05:25.693 --> 05:27.659
at the rite of spring
in the colonies.

05:29.196 --> 05:31.496
Common expression of
adulation in my day.

05:31.498 --> 05:33.332
Guess that one didn't stick.

05:33.334 --> 05:35.667
And we are all
the poorer for it.

05:35.669 --> 05:36.835
Hi, Mr. crane.

05:37.938 --> 05:41.707
Miss Molly is quite
the competitor.

05:41.709 --> 05:43.842
Far and away the most
gifted of her teammates.

05:43.844 --> 05:45.844
Yeah, she's always
been athletic.

05:45.846 --> 05:49.281
She was the most coordinated
baby in day care.

05:52.185 --> 05:55.053
Is that because she's a witness?

05:55.055 --> 05:56.955
No, no.

05:56.957 --> 05:59.858
It does not quite work
like that.

05:59.860 --> 06:04.096
Being a witness does not Grant
one special powers or skills.

06:05.631 --> 06:08.367
A witness is no different
from any other person.

06:08.369 --> 06:10.202
Except that they're
a monster magnet.

06:10.204 --> 06:12.704
Well, d... not exactly.

06:14.207 --> 06:16.908
In the war between
good and evil,

06:16.910 --> 06:19.878
the witnesses will always be
drawn to the site of conflict

06:19.880 --> 06:21.747
in order to...

06:21.749 --> 06:24.116
Witness it.

06:25.718 --> 06:28.720
What we do at that conflict
is entirely up to us.

06:28.722 --> 06:31.890
The lieutenant and I chose to
battle the forces of darkness.

06:31.892 --> 06:34.059
Miss Molly...

06:34.061 --> 06:37.129
May choose
an entirely different path.

06:39.232 --> 06:44.069
But in order to do that,
she must first know who she is.

06:44.071 --> 06:46.238
I know.

06:46.240 --> 06:48.974
I just haven't figured out
how to tell her yet.

06:50.410 --> 06:54.146
I never had a chance
to be father to my son.

06:55.281 --> 06:57.616
Just to sit with him and have...

06:57.618 --> 06:59.818
An honest moment.

07:02.588 --> 07:04.856
I was reminded of this

07:04.858 --> 07:07.926
during my recent ordeal.

07:07.928 --> 07:11.263
And it filled me with regret
once again.

07:17.303 --> 07:19.037
Malcolm dreyfuss.

07:19.039 --> 07:21.773
Enrolled at Stanford
at the age of 15.

07:21.775 --> 07:24.776
Dropped out to launch a start-up
in his parents' garage.

07:24.778 --> 07:27.813
Made his first billion
at the age of 30.

07:27.815 --> 07:29.448
Certified genius.

07:29.450 --> 07:31.383
Every supernatural encounter
we've had

07:31.385 --> 07:32.551
leads back to dreyfuss.

07:32.553 --> 07:33.785
The Lincoln memorial.

07:33.787 --> 07:35.487
Dreyfuss enterprises
had a contract

07:35.489 --> 07:36.955
to restore the statue

07:36.957 --> 07:39.124
before Lincoln's head
went missing.

07:39.126 --> 07:40.492
The dyer house.

07:40.494 --> 07:42.160
Dreyfuss had applied for permits

07:42.162 --> 07:44.129
to drain the swamplands
around it.

07:44.131 --> 07:47.132
Plus he had the banneker folio,
which led us to j street,

07:47.134 --> 07:49.401
where the despair creature
was trapped.

07:49.403 --> 07:52.137
So he's doing all this
to collect mystical artifacts?

07:52.139 --> 07:53.405
To do what?

07:53.407 --> 07:55.540
That is what we must determine.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.143
Master Wells,

07:58.145 --> 08:01.146
you say you saw his man
procuring an item

08:01.148 --> 08:02.414
from the Smithsonian.

08:02.416 --> 08:04.683
"Procuring" is the
nicest way of saying

08:04.685 --> 08:06.751
he incinerated a security guard

08:06.753 --> 08:09.087
while demonically
trashing a storage room.

08:09.089 --> 08:12.157
That guard is officially
a missing person.

08:12.159 --> 08:14.860
It gives us grounds
to question dreyfuss.

08:14.862 --> 08:17.329
Very good.
I should like an opportunity

08:17.331 --> 08:19.664
to get a better measure
of the man.

08:19.666 --> 08:23.168
Whilst agent Thomas and I
have a chat with Mr. dreyfuss,

08:23.170 --> 08:25.437
perhaps you could divine
what it was

08:25.439 --> 08:27.038
he sought from the Smithsonian.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.440
You are, after all,

08:28.442 --> 08:31.009
our artifacts expert.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.845
I wouldn't say
I'm an expert, but...

08:33.847 --> 08:34.913
He was talking to me.

08:37.884 --> 08:39.918
Yeah, I knew that.

08:41.120 --> 08:43.554
<i>Mr. dreyfuss is</i>

08:43.557 --> 08:45.190
just wrapping up a presentation

08:45.192 --> 08:47.292
for our young
entrepreneurs program.

08:47.294 --> 08:50.061
It's so inspiring how
much he gives back.

08:50.063 --> 08:52.864
<i>It's... n... w...
Ansel, ansel, I'm telling you,</i>

08:52.866 --> 08:55.967
<i>th-the pull-down on page two,
it just... it keeps crashing,</i>

08:55.969 --> 08:57.702
<i>it keeps...</i>

08:57.704 --> 09:00.405
<i>Will you please put the...
C-camera down for one second</i>

09:00.407 --> 09:02.307
<i>and help me out, help me out.</i>

09:02.309 --> 09:03.975
<i>Right here. Help. Help.
Run the program in I-d-e</i>

09:03.977 --> 09:05.477
<i>my friend, I'm looking
with a debugger active.</i>

09:05.479 --> 09:07.145
<i>Right at where
the c... code stops</i>

09:07.147 --> 09:09.214
<i>and the bug isn't there...
Do you see a bug?</i>

09:09.216 --> 09:11.550
<i>We got to tear all this down.
Ansel: Relax. This is just like</i>

09:11.552 --> 09:13.418
<i>when we used to hack
arcade game roms.</i>

09:13.420 --> 09:15.820
<i>Did you try g-d-b?</i>

09:19.392 --> 09:21.092
<i>See there? You...</i>

09:21.094 --> 09:22.594
<i>Is that... You got it, man.</i>

09:22.596 --> 09:25.130
<i>We... we got it!</i>

09:38.177 --> 09:40.178
Thank you.

09:40.180 --> 09:42.581
That right there, that...

09:42.583 --> 09:46.351
Was the precise moment
that my company was born.

09:47.920 --> 09:50.422
And in that moment
I had all the skills

09:50.424 --> 09:52.290
and all the knowledge I needed

09:52.292 --> 09:54.426
for success, but the thing is...

09:54.428 --> 09:58.363
I needed ansel... to show me
how to harness it all.

09:59.765 --> 10:02.434
See, ever since we were kids...

10:02.436 --> 10:05.203
He was the one
with all the confidence.

10:05.205 --> 10:07.772
It was ansel's idea to film
all that in the first place.

10:07.774 --> 10:11.276
Even back then, he was convinced
we were... making history.

10:12.945 --> 10:16.648
And ansel...

10:16.650 --> 10:19.951
Ansel continues to teach me
every day.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.653
He reminds me

10:21.655 --> 10:23.488
that our time here

10:23.490 --> 10:26.124
can always be cut
tragically short.

10:26.126 --> 10:29.461
Not one of us knows
when this ride is gonna end.

10:29.463 --> 10:31.129
Right?

10:31.131 --> 10:34.833
So... I'm here

10:34.835 --> 10:38.136
to ask each
and every one of you... this.

10:41.307 --> 10:44.209
<i>What are you gonna do
on your ride?</i>

10:52.585 --> 10:53.985
Thank you for coming.

10:58.591 --> 11:01.092
<i>Welcome to dreyfuss enterprises.</i>

11:01.094 --> 11:02.327
<i>Please pull all the way in.</i>

11:02.329 --> 11:04.996
Sorry,

11:04.998 --> 11:06.931
I don't have you
on my log today.

11:09.101 --> 11:11.169
Excuse me, sir.

11:14.106 --> 11:15.874
Hey.

11:15.876 --> 11:17.242
Do we have a problem?

11:19.111 --> 11:20.779
Dispatch, this is the loading...

12:25.244 --> 12:26.911
Dude, help me out.

12:26.913 --> 12:30.181
That could refer to
so many aspects of your life.

12:30.183 --> 12:32.250
Help you out with what?

12:35.688 --> 12:38.623
Dude, hamsters
learn faster than you.

12:38.625 --> 12:41.259
She's not into you.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.861
Well, that's because...

12:42.863 --> 12:44.262
She doesn't know me.

12:44.264 --> 12:45.964
But if someone

12:45.966 --> 12:48.433
were to pave the way...

12:48.435 --> 12:50.535
<i>If someone</i>

12:50.537 --> 12:52.370
would let her know
how chill I am...

12:52.372 --> 12:54.105
Good luck finding that someone.

12:58.644 --> 13:00.145
Lunch for the rest of the month.

13:00.147 --> 13:02.147
And your parking space.

13:02.149 --> 13:04.149
Deal. Deal.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.791
I found the museum inventory
that you wanted,

13:12.793 --> 13:14.626
but there's no way
of telling which piece

13:14.628 --> 13:16.294
that dreyfuss took.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.396
Not from the inventory alone,
but if you match it up

13:18.398 --> 13:20.398
with the bills of lading
from the last month,

13:20.400 --> 13:22.233
you can figure out what was delivered...
And then figure out

13:22.235 --> 13:24.636
what's no longer there. Wow.

13:24.638 --> 13:26.738
That's sharp.

13:26.740 --> 13:28.807
You'd have to hack into
the database of every carrier

13:28.809 --> 13:30.842
that delivers
to the Smithsonian.

13:30.844 --> 13:33.578
Three down, five to go.

13:34.980 --> 13:36.648
We could divide and conquer.

13:38.517 --> 13:39.684
Cool.

13:39.686 --> 13:41.219
Cool.

13:43.255 --> 13:45.356
I've been using dos attacks.

13:45.358 --> 13:47.826
I'm more of an sql
injection girl myself.

13:54.867 --> 13:56.701
What's with him?

13:56.703 --> 14:00.038
I'm supposed to be
talking him up to you.

14:00.040 --> 14:01.773
I know.

14:01.775 --> 14:03.208
I've already told
him, but I'm getting

14:03.210 --> 14:05.343
a month's worth of
lunches out of this.

14:05.345 --> 14:08.012
Really?

14:08.014 --> 14:09.848
Do you want me to cut you in?

14:09.850 --> 14:11.349
No.

14:11.351 --> 14:13.785
Just flash him a smile.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.872
A security guard
from the Smithsonian

14:33.874 --> 14:36.875
disappeared from his shift
three nights ago.

14:36.877 --> 14:38.943
An eyewitness put this man
at the scene.

14:40.546 --> 14:44.382
Yes, that would be
jobe, my bodyguard.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.217
Jobe... is that his last name?

14:46.219 --> 14:49.721
You know, I never
asked him that.

14:49.723 --> 14:51.723
May we speak with him?

14:51.725 --> 14:54.058
Well, at the moment,

14:54.060 --> 14:55.894
he happens to be on
a special assignment,

14:55.896 --> 14:58.596
and I'm afraid he insists
on keeping his own schedule,

14:58.598 --> 15:00.398
but all things considered,
I have to say

15:00.400 --> 15:02.233
jobe is well worth his quirks.

15:02.235 --> 15:04.602
Yes, I imagine
your own personal demon

15:04.604 --> 15:06.671
can come in quite handy.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.774
Mr. crane...

15:09.776 --> 15:13.244
I hope it's okay
if I call you ichabod.

15:13.246 --> 15:14.913
That name...

15:14.915 --> 15:16.748
Just tickles me to no end.

15:16.750 --> 15:18.583
Please.

15:18.585 --> 15:21.085
Now, if I were to say

15:21.087 --> 15:24.088
I have any idea.

15:24.090 --> 15:25.590
Wha...

15:25.592 --> 15:27.425
What in the world
you're talking about,

15:27.427 --> 15:30.361
why would I discuss
any of this with you?

15:30.363 --> 15:32.931
Because there is no victory
for you without a gallery.

15:32.933 --> 15:35.800
Which is why you told us you'd
sold your soul to the devil.

15:37.370 --> 15:39.203
That's right.

15:39.205 --> 15:40.772
A jest.

15:40.774 --> 15:42.607
Bit of mischief.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.609
And now you're
collecting powerful artifacts

15:44.611 --> 15:48.780
to perpetrate more evil...
No doubt to your great benefit.

15:48.782 --> 15:51.482
Yes, now, that, that...

15:51.484 --> 15:53.451
That does sound like me, yes.

15:53.453 --> 15:56.154
Leveraging assets. Definitely.

15:56.156 --> 15:58.389
Innocent lives be damned.

15:59.391 --> 16:00.959
No.

16:00.961 --> 16:03.795
No. No, no, not-not innocent.

16:03.797 --> 16:06.397
Not at all.

16:06.399 --> 16:09.567
<i>Unless you think you...</i>

16:09.569 --> 16:12.503
Have lived an innocent life...

16:12.505 --> 16:14.138
Ichabod.

16:20.245 --> 16:23.247
Sorry, Mr. dreyfuss,
but we have a situation.

16:25.584 --> 16:27.151
If you'll excuse me.

16:36.662 --> 16:40.264
What? What, what, what?

16:40.266 --> 16:41.566
We've had a breach.

16:44.870 --> 16:47.171
He disabled the security
protocols and gained entrance.

16:47.173 --> 16:51.009
<i>He disabled the secur...
My security... protocol?</i>

16:54.713 --> 16:56.547
Locked out.
How is that possible?

16:56.549 --> 16:58.549
What are you doing?
Calling the server room.

17:19.406 --> 17:21.705
What's going on?

17:24.544 --> 17:26.210
<i>Security breach.</i>

17:26.212 --> 17:27.545
<i>Secure all data
and restricted areas.</i>

17:27.547 --> 17:28.813
<i>Security breach.</i>

17:28.815 --> 17:31.883
<i>Secure all data
and restricted areas.</i>

17:35.220 --> 17:38.623
Someone put the building
in lockdown.

17:40.893 --> 17:43.227
My god.

17:43.229 --> 17:44.295
What happened in there?

17:56.675 --> 17:58.076
Ansel.

18:02.414 --> 18:04.582
Ansel, your former partner?

18:04.584 --> 18:06.350
<i>Your dead partner?</i>

18:18.597 --> 18:20.932
You need to tell us
what's going on, right now.

18:20.934 --> 18:22.300
If he wanted to kill you,

18:22.302 --> 18:24.602
he would not have
announced his presence.

18:24.604 --> 18:26.104
He's taunting you.

18:26.106 --> 18:27.705
Daring you to come after him

18:27.707 --> 18:29.874
because he has what you want.
This is nuts.

18:29.876 --> 18:31.142
What is the artifact?

18:31.144 --> 18:32.543
What are you collecting?
I... really don't

18:32.545 --> 18:33.945
have time for this.
What does ansel want?

18:33.947 --> 18:35.947
I don't know what he...

18:35.949 --> 18:37.615
I don't know what he wan...

18:37.617 --> 18:39.617
Yes?

18:39.619 --> 18:40.618
We're ready, sir.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.286
Okay, good. Listen-listen to me.

18:42.288 --> 18:44.055
No matter what you have to do,

18:44.057 --> 18:45.723
make sure he doesn't get out.

18:45.725 --> 18:47.024
Yes, sir. Go!

18:51.463 --> 18:53.131
Judging by the appearance
of the victims,

18:53.133 --> 18:55.299
ansel is clearly wielding
dark magic.

18:55.301 --> 18:58.136
Your men do not stand a chance
against him.

18:58.138 --> 18:59.303
Hazards of the job.

18:59.305 --> 19:00.404
But no one...

19:00.406 --> 19:01.806
Forced these gentlemen
to sign up

19:01.808 --> 19:02.874
to be security guards.

19:03.842 --> 19:05.676
Listen, you're...

19:05.678 --> 19:07.411
You're free to wait it out here.

19:07.413 --> 19:10.081
You know, it's the safest place
in the building. Please.

19:10.083 --> 19:11.983
No.

19:11.985 --> 19:14.352
We will not stand idly by

19:14.354 --> 19:17.922
whilst innocent men suffer
for your sins.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.699
Wait, what do you mean
you're trapped?

19:28.701 --> 19:31.002
<i>The building's
been sealed off, which means</i>

19:31.004 --> 19:32.937
everyone in here is at the mercy

19:32.939 --> 19:35.106
of a violent
and deranged warlock.

19:35.108 --> 19:37.508
The dreyfuss building's
network is like a tank.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.043
There's no way to break through.

19:39.045 --> 19:41.279
I got it. What, you
cracked their security?

19:41.281 --> 19:42.713
Okay, well, not exactly.

19:42.715 --> 19:44.182
Their admin encryption
is military-grade,

19:44.184 --> 19:45.683
but I was able to get us access

19:45.685 --> 19:47.351
into the lower-level systems,
which is mostly

19:47.353 --> 19:49.120
maintenance stuff,
but it's a foot in the door.

19:49.122 --> 19:51.389
We're working on getting you
out of there.

19:51.391 --> 19:53.057
<i>Just stay safe until we do.</i>

19:53.059 --> 19:55.293
That might not be up to us.

19:55.295 --> 19:57.094
We're too late.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.968
Agent Thomas.

20:41.073 --> 20:42.907
He's in the infrastructure.

20:45.577 --> 20:48.012
Here's what I hacked from
their security cam memory banks.

20:55.020 --> 20:56.187
Hold on. Go back.

20:59.858 --> 21:01.259
So, when he chants a spell,

21:01.261 --> 21:02.760
it activates those
markings on his skin.

21:02.762 --> 21:04.262
And those just aren't
any markings.

21:04.264 --> 21:06.430
Those are sigils. Sigils?

21:06.432 --> 21:08.532
Yeah, demonic symbols...
Each sigil will cast

21:08.534 --> 21:10.268
a different kind
of killing spell.

21:10.270 --> 21:11.269
Sigils are

21:11.271 --> 21:13.037
usually recorded

21:13.039 --> 21:15.773
in occult texts, they're
not branded onto people's skin.

21:15.775 --> 21:18.376
Yeah, because once you access
a sigil, it burns itself out.

21:18.378 --> 21:20.811
I can't imagine what happens
if it's on your body.

21:20.813 --> 21:21.879
I'm gonna look into

21:21.881 --> 21:23.514
how to combat sigil magic, okay?

21:32.057 --> 21:34.659
Crane, those men back there...

21:34.661 --> 21:37.795
Yes. 'Twas a grim sight.

21:37.797 --> 21:39.964
I can't expose Molly to this.

21:39.966 --> 21:42.233
If homeland security
can't handle it,

21:42.235 --> 21:44.869
how is my ten-year-old
daughter supposed to?

21:51.143 --> 21:52.977
No.

22:02.688 --> 22:05.690
Greek fire.

22:05.692 --> 22:07.992
It ignites a flame so voracious

22:07.994 --> 22:10.161
it can never be extinguished.

22:13.031 --> 22:14.732
Crane?

22:21.173 --> 22:23.874
He's going to destroy
the entire building.

22:28.280 --> 22:30.581
Hello, Malcolm.

22:32.617 --> 22:34.251
Ansel?

22:36.188 --> 22:38.255
Is it really you?

22:40.292 --> 22:43.060
Thank god.

22:43.062 --> 22:45.296
It's a miracle, my friend...
Shut up.

22:47.866 --> 22:50.201
You've gotten overconfident.

22:50.203 --> 22:53.104
Your security algorithms
are for crap.

22:54.373 --> 22:56.574
You used to be better than that.

22:56.576 --> 23:00.644
I am...
far better than that now.

23:01.580 --> 23:03.381
And I think we both know

23:03.383 --> 23:05.383
I have always
been better than you.

23:05.385 --> 23:06.751
Yes.

23:06.753 --> 23:09.620
You were the better
coder and engineer.

23:10.889 --> 23:13.391
But you couldn't
leave it at that.

23:13.393 --> 23:17.728
You still had to find
a way to get rid of me.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.764
Because it was always,

23:19.766 --> 23:22.767
<i>always about you, ansel.</i>

23:22.769 --> 23:26.437
No one ever took me seriously
when you were around.

23:26.439 --> 23:29.173
It just didn't seem to matter
to anyone

23:29.175 --> 23:33.010
<i>that I was... I was the brains,
but you know</i>

23:33.012 --> 23:34.578
I was the brains behind...

23:34.580 --> 23:36.647
Everything.

23:38.183 --> 23:41.685
All they wanted was to...
Talk to the face.

23:41.687 --> 23:43.621
And now...

23:43.623 --> 23:46.090
Look at my face.

23:48.693 --> 23:52.029
You should have just
had me killed.

23:52.031 --> 23:54.031
Death would have been a relief.

23:54.033 --> 23:58.269
Instead, you banished me
to a circle of hell

23:58.271 --> 24:00.638
where every day a new demon

24:00.640 --> 24:04.175
burned their name into my flesh.

24:06.279 --> 24:08.946
Took pleasure at my agony.

24:08.948 --> 24:10.948
But I escaped.

24:10.950 --> 24:13.384
Made it back to this world.

24:13.386 --> 24:17.054
Studied what each
of these scars meant

24:17.056 --> 24:18.956
and how to use them.

24:18.958 --> 24:20.958
So my pain...

24:20.960 --> 24:24.628
Is now my power.

24:34.739 --> 24:36.240
What do you want?

24:36.242 --> 24:38.642
I want my life back.

24:42.147 --> 24:44.315
You have the other pieces.

24:44.317 --> 24:46.150
I want them.

24:46.152 --> 24:48.152
Drop him!

24:53.425 --> 24:56.327
You both should want him dead.

24:56.329 --> 24:58.095
What happens after you kill him?

24:58.097 --> 25:00.698
You bring down the entire
building with everybody in it?

25:02.001 --> 25:03.868
We found the Greek fire.

25:03.870 --> 25:05.503
What good is killing him

25:05.505 --> 25:08.072
if I allow what he's built
to survive?

25:25.190 --> 25:27.391
Agent Thomas!

26:05.397 --> 26:06.463
Go! Go! Go!

26:12.671 --> 26:14.071
Is there another way out?

26:14.073 --> 26:15.573
No. The only way out

26:15.575 --> 26:17.575
is back up where ansel is.

26:18.777 --> 26:20.411
I've locked out the controls.

26:20.413 --> 26:23.514
That'll not hold him for long.

26:23.516 --> 26:25.583
He's come this far;
He won't stop now.

26:28.019 --> 26:29.587
Here.

26:30.689 --> 26:32.690
All right. All right, all right.

26:37.762 --> 26:39.763
I can't reach Diana or crane.

26:39.765 --> 26:41.932
That's not good.
Hopefully, it just means

26:41.934 --> 26:43.434
they're somewhere
without a signal.

26:43.436 --> 26:46.437
I got it. Got it,
got it, got it. Okay.

26:46.439 --> 26:48.772
So, sigils are symbols

26:48.774 --> 26:50.874
that are activated
by saying a spell, right?

26:50.876 --> 26:53.777
Now, what if you could sever
the symbol from the spell?

26:53.779 --> 26:56.146
That, of course,
led me to John Dee,

26:56.148 --> 26:57.448
who specialized in
hermetic languages.

26:57.450 --> 26:59.550
And I don't even
have to tell you,

26:59.552 --> 27:01.385
Jake? Deciphering all
of that Enoch... Yes.

27:01.387 --> 27:02.820
Focus. Got it.
Okay, now, this is

27:02.822 --> 27:04.388
a nam-shub,

27:04.390 --> 27:06.323
an incantation that can
disrupt the connection

27:06.325 --> 27:07.958
between language and symbols.

27:07.960 --> 27:10.794
This goes all the way back
to the tower of babel.

27:10.796 --> 27:12.630
It's like a shutdown command.

27:12.632 --> 27:14.798
So if someone recites
this while the warlock

27:14.800 --> 27:16.800
is activating a sigil...
It should deactivate it.

27:16.802 --> 27:19.737
Okay, we just need to find a way
to get this phrase to crane.

27:19.739 --> 27:22.139
But how? We can't reach him,
and the building's locked down.

27:22.141 --> 27:23.974
Okay, well, we have access

27:23.976 --> 27:24.975
to all of the maintenance
systems, right,

27:24.977 --> 27:25.976
including ventilation.

27:25.978 --> 27:26.977
Right. I thought of that,

27:26.979 --> 27:27.978
but the building switches

27:27.980 --> 27:29.146
to a self-contained air supply.

27:29.148 --> 27:30.581
All the outside vents
are closed.

27:30.583 --> 27:32.583
Well, what if tell the system
that the air supply

27:32.585 --> 27:33.584
has been used up?

27:33.586 --> 27:34.818
Then it would have to switch

27:34.820 --> 27:36.820
into backup mode
and vent air from the outside.

27:38.423 --> 27:40.324
Wait-wait, you're going in
through the air duct?

27:40.326 --> 27:41.825
Yup. I should go with you.

27:41.827 --> 27:44.361
Why? You know, in
case you need backup.

27:44.363 --> 27:46.163
Actually, I could
really use your help

27:46.165 --> 27:47.865
monitoring the situation
from here,

27:47.867 --> 27:50.668
you know, in case we need
any more info on the sigils.

27:50.670 --> 27:53.003
You're the expert, right? Right.

27:53.005 --> 27:55.072
Thank you.

27:58.843 --> 28:00.678
What happened?

28:00.680 --> 28:03.280
Your pulse is strong, but you
may have internal injuries.

28:07.519 --> 28:09.353
Listen...

28:09.355 --> 28:11.522
If I don't make it...

28:11.524 --> 28:12.890
Tell Molly...

28:12.892 --> 28:15.359
If she keeps hanging out
with that snotty girl Erica,

28:15.361 --> 28:17.061
she'll end up
with a lower-back tattoo

28:17.063 --> 28:18.862
and a life full of regret.

28:18.864 --> 28:20.531
That sounds
rather like a conversation

28:20.533 --> 28:21.865
for mother and daughter.

28:27.072 --> 28:29.873
There's so much
I should tell her.

28:29.875 --> 28:31.942
I just don't know how.

28:33.244 --> 28:35.813
What kind of mother
does that make me?

28:39.551 --> 28:42.319
Agent Thomas, you are
an excellent detective

28:42.321 --> 28:44.321
and an intrepid soldier,

28:44.323 --> 28:46.557
but most of all...

28:46.559 --> 28:48.892
You are a superior parent.

28:48.894 --> 28:51.829
I have no doubt when
the time comes to tell Molly,

28:51.831 --> 28:53.664
you will find the words.

28:53.666 --> 28:56.400
Your misgivings
are quite unfounded,

28:56.402 --> 29:00.738
for you are governed by one law:

29:00.740 --> 29:03.273
Truth.

29:03.275 --> 29:07.578
And with you by her side,
Molly shall never know fear...

29:07.580 --> 29:10.080
Nor apprehension.

29:12.517 --> 29:14.752
Quite the pep talk.

29:14.754 --> 29:17.254
Ever thought
of coaching youth soccer?

29:17.256 --> 29:20.357
Oof. One deadly situation
at a time, please.

29:22.260 --> 29:23.427
I think some of these

29:23.429 --> 29:26.697
might help us hold him off.

29:26.699 --> 29:28.932
Or we could give him these.

29:28.934 --> 29:31.935
These are what he seeks,
after all, are they not?

29:31.937 --> 29:33.103
No, no, no, we...

29:33.105 --> 29:34.705
We can't let him have these.

29:34.707 --> 29:36.039
Why?

29:36.041 --> 29:37.875
What are they,
and why does he want them?

29:37.877 --> 29:39.309
Okay, first of all,

29:39.311 --> 29:41.311
you got to understand
what it was like

29:41.313 --> 29:43.614
when we were first starting out,

29:43.616 --> 29:46.950
when we were just... just
beginning to launch our company.

29:46.952 --> 29:48.986
<i>Right away, ansel, he...</i>

29:48.988 --> 29:51.722
<i>He became
the face of the company.</i>

29:51.724 --> 29:53.657
<i>And I became his shadow.</i>

29:55.728 --> 29:58.796
<i>And he never sought out
the attention, but...</i>

29:58.798 --> 30:00.798
<i>That just made things worse.</i>

30:00.800 --> 30:02.466
<i>It was all my work.</i>

30:02.468 --> 30:05.469
<i>It was all my work...
All my ideas, everything...</i>

30:05.471 --> 30:07.504
<i>But no one ever saw that.</i>

30:07.506 --> 30:10.073
<i>All they saw was ansel.</i>

30:11.810 --> 30:15.145
<i>I decided I would make them see.</i>

30:15.147 --> 30:17.080
<i>I took possession of everything.</i>

30:17.082 --> 30:19.750
<i>All my work... every program,
every circuit, everything.</i>

30:19.752 --> 30:21.418
<i>Of course, I knew the investors,</i>

30:21.420 --> 30:23.320
<i>they'd file suit
to get everything back,</i>

30:23.322 --> 30:25.189
<i>but at that moment...</i>

30:25.191 --> 30:26.857
<i>It didn't matter.</i>

30:26.859 --> 30:30.327
<i>Because something
was telling me to do this.</i>

30:30.329 --> 30:33.096
<i>Something or someone.</i>

30:33.098 --> 30:36.166
What do you want?

31:17.041 --> 31:18.375
No...

31:18.377 --> 31:20.644
No, no, no, no, no,

31:20.646 --> 31:22.379
no, that's my life.

31:22.381 --> 31:25.048
Please.

31:25.050 --> 31:27.217
That's my life. Please.

31:27.219 --> 31:29.386
Give me my life back.

31:29.388 --> 31:32.256
I've often wondered
wh-what it was

31:32.258 --> 31:34.825
about that particular moment.

31:34.827 --> 31:38.328
Were those woods in some sort
of mystically charged area

31:38.330 --> 31:39.963
or something?

31:40.932 --> 31:43.333
That night I made a request.

31:46.738 --> 31:49.139
And I got an answer.

32:14.933 --> 32:17.334
No. It wasn't a dream.

32:19.938 --> 32:20.938
Who are you?

32:20.940 --> 32:22.839
A messenger.

32:36.454 --> 32:39.556
This is a c... c-contract?

32:39.558 --> 32:40.557
For what?

32:40.559 --> 32:42.526
For the life
you were meant to have.

32:51.135 --> 32:53.403
"As...

32:53.405 --> 32:56.573
Payment, signee agrees to..."

32:57.742 --> 32:59.076
"Surrender his soul

32:59.078 --> 33:02.212
upon... death"?

33:07.585 --> 33:10.587
A-and if I... I don't agree?

33:15.527 --> 33:16.660
No, no, no.

33:16.662 --> 33:18.829
<i>No, no, no.</i>

33:26.170 --> 33:27.437
What about ansel?

33:27.439 --> 33:29.940
You won't have to worry
about him anymore.

33:29.942 --> 33:32.609
I'll see that
he's taken care of.

33:52.197 --> 33:54.898
I never asked for anything bad
to happen to ansel.

33:54.900 --> 33:56.266
You had no need.

33:57.535 --> 33:59.302
You knew that
your unholy alliance

33:59.304 --> 34:01.238
would lead to his grisly demise.

34:01.240 --> 34:02.806
Yeah.

34:02.808 --> 34:05.709
And I have a feeling
I'm gonna pay for it.

34:07.045 --> 34:09.146
In ways we can't begin
to imagine.

34:16.920 --> 34:19.790
You were trying to renege
on your deal.

34:21.225 --> 34:22.559
You received
everything you desired,

34:22.561 --> 34:24.161
and now you realize
you don't want

34:24.163 --> 34:26.396
to sacrifice your soul,
so you're trying

34:26.398 --> 34:28.831
to cheat your way out of it,
aren't you?

34:28.833 --> 34:30.067
How?

35:09.775 --> 35:11.708
Finally.

35:25.656 --> 35:27.624
Where is the last piece?

35:27.626 --> 35:28.892
I don't have it.

35:28.894 --> 35:30.060
I swear to you

35:30.062 --> 35:31.628
I don't have it.

35:31.630 --> 35:33.563
The stone's
transformative powers

35:33.565 --> 35:36.333
can only be activated if
it is whole... only then

35:36.335 --> 35:38.335
can my life be restored.

35:38.337 --> 35:41.805
So I must have the last piece.

35:41.807 --> 35:43.874
What is this stone?

35:44.742 --> 35:46.176
How can it do as you say?

35:46.178 --> 35:48.011
He hasn't told you?

35:48.013 --> 35:50.313
This is the philosopher's stone,

35:50.315 --> 35:52.916
the most powerful magical item

35:52.918 --> 35:54.084
ever known to man.

35:54.086 --> 35:55.852
It can transmute all the pain

35:55.854 --> 35:59.022
I have suffered
and give me back my life.

35:59.024 --> 36:01.258
And this time...

36:01.260 --> 36:04.161
It will be life eternal.

36:06.430 --> 36:08.932
The philosopher's stone.

36:10.001 --> 36:12.435
You were going
to cheat out of your deal

36:12.437 --> 36:14.171
by cheating death itself.

36:14.173 --> 36:16.339
If I never die,

36:16.341 --> 36:18.775
I never have to lose my soul.

36:18.777 --> 36:20.443
More tricks

36:20.445 --> 36:21.778
and games.

36:21.780 --> 36:24.281
That comes to an end now.

36:29.887 --> 36:32.722
Tell me where the last piece is.

36:39.398 --> 36:41.631
<i>Graupha keph</i>

36:41.633 --> 36:43.266
<i>pai!</i>

36:48.539 --> 36:49.706
<i>Machis</i>

36:49.708 --> 36:51.975
<i>nach med tal!</i>

37:02.154 --> 37:03.954
I'm all right, all right.

37:06.090 --> 37:07.157
Crane!

37:09.894 --> 37:11.094
The Greek fire.

37:11.096 --> 37:14.331
There are other paths
to eternity.

37:38.189 --> 37:39.189
Nice throw.

37:39.191 --> 37:40.757
Nice catch.

37:43.928 --> 37:45.762
Where is dreyfuss?

37:49.767 --> 37:51.268
He's gone.

37:51.270 --> 37:54.271
And he's taken
the philosopher's stone.

38:01.045 --> 38:02.445
How are the quesadillas coming?

38:02.447 --> 38:03.947
Not bad.

38:03.949 --> 38:08.451
Here. You always burn
the tortillas anyway.

38:08.453 --> 38:10.887
I like them crunchy.

38:17.728 --> 38:19.696
Yours.

38:33.812 --> 38:35.145
How bad did you hurt yourself?

38:35.147 --> 38:37.314
The doctor said
workout injuries like this,

38:37.316 --> 38:39.015
um, they're not so bad.

38:39.017 --> 38:41.084
Be better in a few days.

38:56.334 --> 38:58.201
Baby, I got to talk to you

38:58.203 --> 38:59.936
about something.

38:59.938 --> 39:01.504
You know Mr. crane?

39:01.506 --> 39:02.672
Yeah. He's awesome.

39:02.674 --> 39:05.709
Yeah, he is awesome.

39:05.711 --> 39:07.877
He's also special.

39:07.879 --> 39:09.779
What do you mean?
You remember how I told you

39:09.781 --> 39:11.948
when I was in the marines
sometimes I'd get chosen

39:11.950 --> 39:13.850
for special missions?

39:13.852 --> 39:15.352
Yeah. Mr. crane

39:15.354 --> 39:16.720
has been chosen for one.

39:16.722 --> 39:18.021
And it's bigger
than the marines.

39:18.023 --> 39:21.358
It has to do with... Everything.

39:21.360 --> 39:22.959
He's been specially

39:22.961 --> 39:25.195
selected.

39:25.197 --> 39:27.564
And we think you have been, too.

39:27.566 --> 39:28.631
Me?

39:29.867 --> 39:31.201
Selected by who?

39:31.203 --> 39:33.203
We don't really know.

39:33.205 --> 39:34.304
Well, what's the mission?

39:34.306 --> 39:36.539
It's about making the world
a better place.

39:36.541 --> 39:40.310
You and Mr. crane are
what's known as witnesses.

39:40.312 --> 39:41.878
Witnesses.

39:43.214 --> 39:44.647
What does that mean?

39:44.649 --> 39:46.216
It means a lot of people

39:46.218 --> 39:48.151
are gonna be counting on you.

39:48.153 --> 39:50.620
And you're gonna do
great things.

39:53.891 --> 39:57.093
When you called me and asked me
to talk to Mr. crane,

39:57.095 --> 40:00.263
to tell him that he was
important and to have hope,

40:00.265 --> 40:02.265
was that part of the mission?

40:02.267 --> 40:03.666
Yeah, it was.

40:03.668 --> 40:05.135
So, how'd I do?

40:06.070 --> 40:08.405
You did really well.

40:08.407 --> 40:09.572
You helped him

40:09.574 --> 40:11.674
when he really needed it.
Good, 'cause...

40:11.676 --> 40:13.276
I like Mr. crane.

40:13.278 --> 40:16.413
And I want to help people,
like you do.

40:17.348 --> 40:19.015
That's how you got hurt.

40:20.851 --> 40:23.420
You didn't get hurt working out.

40:23.422 --> 40:25.789
You got hurt

40:25.791 --> 40:28.858
stopping bad people
from doing bad things.

40:31.429 --> 40:34.197
Mom, you can always
tell me the truth.

40:35.366 --> 40:36.833
Okay.

40:38.269 --> 40:40.103
You have a deal.

40:40.105 --> 40:41.471
That's a relief, 'cause...

40:41.473 --> 40:43.506
There's something
I got to tell you.

40:44.442 --> 40:46.476
Burnt quesadillas suck.

40:46.478 --> 40:48.111
Yeah.

40:48.113 --> 40:49.612
All right.

40:49.614 --> 40:51.214
Grab us some drinks.

40:51.216 --> 40:52.382
Okay.

41:01.892 --> 41:03.960
Witnesses.

41:06.630 --> 41:08.998
So... there's no
sign of dreyfuss.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.400
Nope.

41:10.402 --> 41:11.634
No reports of him anywhere.

41:11.636 --> 41:13.136
But I guess if you're
a billionaire

41:13.138 --> 41:14.971
and you want to stay hidden,
you stay hidden.

41:14.973 --> 41:17.474
Yeah, well, at least he
doesn't have the last piece

41:17.476 --> 41:18.808
of the philosopher's stone.

41:18.810 --> 41:20.477
Yeah, but for how long?

41:20.479 --> 41:22.645
By the way,

41:22.647 --> 41:24.314
I finished cross-checking
the Smithsonian inventory.

41:24.316 --> 41:25.815
Found out what dreyfuss took

41:25.817 --> 41:27.350
from there.

41:27.352 --> 41:29.652
"Diagrammatical plottings
of geoglyphs,

41:29.654 --> 41:32.322
Alfred Watkins, 1925."

41:32.324 --> 41:34.757
Alfred Watkins... The
British archaeologist.

41:34.759 --> 41:37.193
You know, pioneered the mapping of...
Ley lines.

41:37.195 --> 41:41.097
Alignments of mystical energy
that circle the earth.

41:41.099 --> 41:44.834
What would dreyfuss want
with a map of ley lines?

41:45.836 --> 41:47.837
This is a scan I made

41:47.839 --> 41:49.839
of the blavatsky map.

41:49.841 --> 41:53.443
It shows all of the major
ley lines in north America.

41:53.445 --> 41:55.011
Does this look anything like

41:55.013 --> 41:57.113
what dreyfuss' demon took
from the storage room?

42:00.384 --> 42:04.020
No. The one he had didn't have
any geographical features.

42:04.022 --> 42:05.688
Okay.

42:07.559 --> 42:09.025
Yeah, it was more like that.

42:09.027 --> 42:10.360
What are these?

42:10.362 --> 42:12.729
Convergence points. Spots where

42:12.731 --> 42:15.031
the mystical energies peak.

42:15.033 --> 42:16.533
Wait.

42:16.535 --> 42:19.602
Pull up a, current GPS map
of the D.C. area.

42:25.075 --> 42:27.310
This is the Lincoln memorial.

42:27.312 --> 42:30.213
And this is where we
found the dyer house.

42:30.215 --> 42:32.415
George Washington hid the
philosopher's stone pieces

42:32.417 --> 42:34.651
on the strongest ley line
intersections.

42:34.653 --> 42:38.621
Presumably, that's where
we'll find the last piece.

42:41.058 --> 42:43.993
Whoa. Intense.

42:43.995 --> 42:45.562
Of course.

42:45.564 --> 42:47.063
What? Where is it?

42:49.900 --> 42:52.302
Sleepy hollow.
