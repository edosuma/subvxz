WEBVTT

00:01.800 --> 00:02.767
I'M SORRY, I HAVE TO GO.

00:02.800 --> 00:05.064
ANNOUNCER: Previously on
Pretty Little Liars...

00:05.100 --> 00:06.089
Woman:
WHAT HAPPENED?

00:06.140 --> 00:07.095
HE LEFI' ME.

00:07.140 --> 00:09.062
SOMEONE AT A SANITARIUM
YOU OWN

00:09.110 --> 00:11.465
PAID DETECTIVE WILDEN
TO ALTER HIS REPORT.

00:11.510 --> 00:12.499
Man: YOU COULD DO A LOT
OF DAMAGE WITH THAT.

00:12.540 --> 00:15.077
COULD SHUT
THE WHOLE PLACE DOWN.
CLOSE RADLEY?

00:17.610 --> 00:19.339
DID YOU MISS ME?

00:19.380 --> 00:20.677
Spencer:
YOU STILL LOVE HIM.

00:20.720 --> 00:22.187
WHETHER I DO OR I DON'T,
I'M JUST

00:22.220 --> 00:24.142
TRYING TO FIGURE
THINGS OUT WITH JAKE.

00:24.190 --> 00:25.384
OKAY, SO LET ME HELP YOU.

00:25.420 --> 00:28.287
YOU LIKE JAKE.
YOU LOVE EZRA.

00:30.130 --> 00:31.688
"A" WAS HERE?
GUYS...

00:31.730 --> 00:33.652
ALI'S BOOK IS GONE.

00:33.700 --> 00:34.724
HEY.

00:34.760 --> 00:36.125
GO'I'I'A YOU SOMETHING.
YOU DROVE ALL THAT WAY,
SO...

00:36.170 --> 00:39.298
CAN'T I JUST BE A NICE GUY?

00:39.340 --> 00:40.762
( phone ringing )

00:40.800 --> 00:42.665
Emily: LOOKS LIKE I'M WINNING.
Aria: THANKS FOR THE TIP.

00:42.710 --> 00:44.530
THE JOURNAL.
WE GAVE ALI TO "A."

00:44.570 --> 00:46.379
WHOEVER FINDS HER
GETS TO KEEP HER.

00:47.380 --> 00:49.029
COME ON.

00:51.180 --> 00:53.740
Woman: THE TECH SAID
THE BUSY BEE INN.

00:54.720 --> 00:56.813
CAN'T THIS THING
GO ANY FASTER?

00:56.850 --> 01:00.149
IT'S HARD TO SEE
OUT HERE. THERE'S NO
LIGHTS ON THIS ROAD.

01:00.190 --> 01:03.353
THE GPS SAYS IT'S
A MILE STRAIGHT AHEAD.

01:03.390 --> 01:06.154
IF "A'S" BEEN AT THE
INN SINCE HE SENT THAT TEXT,

01:06.200 --> 01:09.294
AREN'T WE GONNA BE
TOO LATE TO HELP ALI?

01:09.330 --> 01:10.820
WELL, WE WON'T KNOW
THAT UNTIL WE GET THERE.

01:10.870 --> 01:13.430
THAT'S IF ALI'S EVEN THERE.

01:13.470 --> 01:14.698
WE'RE GOING OFF SOMETHING
SHE WROTE IN A JOURNAL

01:14.740 --> 01:16.207
TWO YEARS AGO.

01:20.340 --> 01:23.207
THERE IT IS.
TURN RIGHT.

01:32.920 --> 01:34.615
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED HERE?

01:37.690 --> 01:39.351
LOOKS LIKE THERE WAS
SOME KIND OF STRUGGLE.

01:43.670 --> 01:46.366
I COULD DEFINITELY
SEE ALI WEARING THIS.

01:48.900 --> 01:51.630
IF ALI WAS HERE,
WHERE DID SHE GO?

01:51.670 --> 01:54.207
MAYBE SHE FOUGHT "A"
OFF AND GOT AWAY.

01:54.240 --> 01:56.606
YEAH, OR HE TOOK
HER SOMEWHERE ELSE.

01:56.650 --> 01:58.174
OR WORSE.

02:00.480 --> 02:02.414
( creaking door)

02:09.790 --> 02:12.258
* GOT A SECRET,
CAN YOU KEEP IT'S *

02:12.300 --> 02:14.621
* WHERE THIS ONE
YOU SAVE *

02:14.660 --> 02:16.628
* GOT A LOCKET,
IN YOUR POCKET *

02:16.670 --> 02:19.434
* TAKING THIS ONE
TO THE GRAVE *

02:19.470 --> 02:21.836
* EVER SHOW YOU
THAT I KNOW YOU *

02:21.870 --> 02:24.338
* WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID

02:24.370 --> 02:26.907
* 'CAUSE TWO CAN KEEP A SECRET

02:26.940 --> 02:29.579
* IF ONE OF THEM IS DEAD

02:34.480 --> 02:36.812
THE WORST PART IS NOT KNOWING
WHAT HAPPENED TO HER.

02:36.850 --> 02:39.353
IT'S LIKE DEJA VU
ALL OVER AGAIN.

02:39.390 --> 02:42.382
JUST THE THOUGHT OF HER IN
THAT ROOM MAKES MY SKIN CRAWL.

02:42.430 --> 02:46.218
I DON'T THINK SHE WAS STAYING
THERE. AT LEAST NOT LAST NIGHT.

02:46.260 --> 02:48.421
HOW COULD YOU SAY THAT?
YOU SAW THE ROOM.

02:48.460 --> 02:50.496
THE BROKEN WINDOW.
THE MESSAGE ON THE DOOR.

02:50.530 --> 02:53.567
YEAH, EXACTLY. EVERYTHING WAS
A LITTLE BIT TOO NEAT.

02:55.770 --> 02:57.362
THAT ALL JUST TO SCARE US?

02:57.410 --> 02:59.571
WHERE ARE YOU?
I CAN BARELY HEAR YOU.

02:59.610 --> 03:01.635
THE CHURCH. MY MOM
WANTED ME TO DROP OFF

03:01.680 --> 03:03.272
A PIE FOR THE BAKE SALE.

03:03.310 --> 03:04.402
Hanna:
JUST CALL ME LATER, OKAY?

03:04.450 --> 03:06.247
OKAY.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.194
( knocking on door)

03:37.980 --> 03:40.471
DAD.

03:41.450 --> 03:42.940
HOW DID YOU
KNOW I'D BE HERE?

03:42.990 --> 03:47.814
I DIDN'T.
I CAME TO SEE TOBY.

03:47.860 --> 03:50.488
I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU WERE
STAYING AT HANNA'S LAST NIGHT.

03:50.530 --> 03:52.748
I CHANGED MY MIND.

03:52.800 --> 03:54.495
GET DRESSED.
YOU'RE LEAVING.

03:54.530 --> 03:55.394
SURE.

03:55.430 --> 03:57.625
RIGHT AFTER YOU CALL MOM
AND EXPLAIN TO HER

03:57.670 --> 04:00.662
WHAT'S GOING ON BETWEEN
YOU AND MRS. DILAURENTIS.

04:00.700 --> 04:02.258
OR SHOULD I?

04:11.710 --> 04:13.974
JASON FELL OFF THE WAGON.

04:14.020 --> 04:15.044
WHAT?

04:15.080 --> 04:18.948
JESSICA AND I HAVE BEEN
HELPING HIM GET INTO REHAB.

04:21.820 --> 04:24.357
OKAY. BUT WHY ALL THE SECRECY?

04:24.390 --> 04:26.620
IT'S NOT LIKE THIS
HASN'T HAPPENED BEFORE.

04:26.660 --> 04:29.891
HE WAS ARRESTED FOR
STARTING A FIGHT IN A BAR.

04:29.930 --> 04:31.420
HE DIDN'T WANT US
TO TELL ANYONE.

04:31.470 --> 04:32.960
WE WERE RESPECT ING HIS WISHES.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.036
AND THAT'S WHY
JESSICA WANTED TO WAIT

04:35.070 --> 04:36.833
TO TELL HIM
ABOUT THE DIVORCE.

04:36.870 --> 04:40.772
THEY TOLD US ANY UPSE'I'I'ING NEWS
COULD CAUSE A RELAPSE. SO...

04:42.080 --> 04:43.672
BUT WHY ARE YOU
WORKING SO HARD

04:43.710 --> 04:45.507
TO KEEP THIS
A SECRET FROM MOM?

04:45.550 --> 04:48.917
SPENCER, IF I NEVER MENTIONED
JESSICA OR JASON'S NAME AGAIN

04:48.950 --> 04:52.351
IT WOULD BE TOO SOON
FOR YOUR MOTHER.

04:52.390 --> 04:53.379
SEE, I'M NOT LYING TO HER,

04:53.420 --> 04:55.513
I'M JUST NOT
SHARING EVERYTHING.

04:56.590 --> 04:57.989
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE.

04:59.860 --> 05:02.363
HEY, SPENCE,
I GOT THE HOT WATER WORKING.

05:05.800 --> 05:08.439
PUT SOME PANTS ON. WE NEED
TO TALK ABOUT RADLEY.

05:10.070 --> 05:11.935
ALONE.

05:17.580 --> 05:19.445
Ezra:
YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU'VE SEEN A GHOST.

05:20.880 --> 05:23.986
YEAH, HANNA HAD
A ROUGH NIGHT.

05:24.020 --> 05:25.885
OH, I THOUGHT SHE
WAS DOING BETTER.

05:27.090 --> 05:29.354
SHE'S UP AND DOWN.

05:31.730 --> 05:34.096
I WAS HOPING WE COULD SPEND
THE MORNING TOGETHER.

05:34.130 --> 05:36.963
I WISH I COULD,
BUT I'M HEADING
TO PHILLY IN A MOMENT

05:37.000 --> 05:38.422
TO MEET A COLLEGE BUDDY.

05:38.470 --> 05:39.664
HARDY?

05:39.700 --> 05:43.431
NO, NO. UM, CURTIS.
THE LACROSSE GUY
I TOLD YOU ABOUT.

05:43.470 --> 05:46.701
WE COULD DO DINNER.
WE COULD MEET AT THE CABIN.

05:46.740 --> 05:50.779
AH, I JUST DON'T THINK
THAT I SHOULD GO THAT FAR.

05:50.810 --> 05:53.040
IN CASE HANNA NEEDS ME
OR SOMETHING.

05:53.080 --> 05:55.048
( phone ringing )

06:02.790 --> 06:05.452
JAKE'S BACK
FROM HIS TOURNAMENT?

06:05.490 --> 06:08.948
YEAH, HE GOT IN FROM
HARRISBURG LAST NIGHT.

06:10.770 --> 06:12.465
MORNING WITH ME.
AFTERNOON WITH HIM.

06:12.500 --> 06:14.593
NO, IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

06:14.640 --> 06:17.564
I'M SORRY,
IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS.

06:17.610 --> 06:19.532
AND I PUT YOU
IN THIS POSITION.

06:19.580 --> 06:22.401
SO, YOU TAKE YOUR
TIME AND DECIDE--

06:22.450 --> 06:25.146
I'VE MADE UP MY MIND.

06:25.180 --> 06:27.978
I'M GONNA
TALK TO HIM TODAY.

06:28.020 --> 06:29.419
YOU ARE?

06:29.450 --> 06:30.883
YES.

06:33.860 --> 06:37.580
YOU'RE THE ONE.
YOU ALWAYS HAVE BEEN.

06:42.830 --> 06:44.821
YOU'RE REALLY GIVING
AWAY ALL THESE CLOTH ES?

06:44.870 --> 06:47.031
THAT'S LIKE HALF
OF YOUR WARDROBE.

06:47.070 --> 06:49.868
I'M JUST SICK
OF THE SAME OLD THINGS.

06:52.810 --> 06:55.904
YOU BOUGHT THAT
DRESS LAST MONTH.
IT LOOKS BEAUTIFUL ON YOU.

06:55.940 --> 06:57.805
WELL, IF YOU LIKE
IT SO MUCH, YOU CAN HAVE IT.

07:03.250 --> 07:05.946
YOU SEEMED REALLY
UPSET LAST NIGHT.

07:05.990 --> 07:07.116
DO WANNA TALK ABOUT IT?

07:07.160 --> 07:08.912
SPENCE, THE LAST THING
I WANNA DO IS DISCUSS

07:08.960 --> 07:10.882
MY FEELINGS OVER
A TUB OF CHUNKY MONKEY.

07:14.530 --> 07:18.523
OKAY, THAT'S YOUR
FAVORITE SKIRT.

07:18.570 --> 07:21.630
NO. IT WAS CALEB'S FAVORITE.

07:23.970 --> 07:27.007
LOOK, IF YOU NEED MORE
TIME TO PROCESS--
SPENCER.

07:27.040 --> 07:30.009
WHAT IS THERE TO PROCESS?
HE MOVED ON.
SO ,I'M MOVING ON, TOO.

07:32.210 --> 07:35.077
HANNA? THEY'RE MOVING
EVERYTHING OUT OF THE BASEMENT
WHILE THEY FIX THAT PIPE.

07:35.120 --> 07:37.611
WHAT IN THE WORLD
IS HAPPENING IN HERE?

07:37.650 --> 07:39.857
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN ANYONE
CLEAN OUT THEIR CLOSET BEFORE?

07:39.890 --> 07:41.209
NOT IN THIS HOUSE.

07:43.560 --> 07:45.118
LOOK, MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T
BE IN SUCH A RUSH

07:45.160 --> 07:46.821
TO GET RID OF
ALL THESE THINGS.

07:46.860 --> 07:47.895
WHERE YOU GOING?

07:47.930 --> 07:49.625
I NEED MORE BAGS.

07:58.870 --> 08:00.599
( creaking door)

08:05.010 --> 08:07.171
HELLO?

08:07.220 --> 08:09.017
ANYONE THERE?

08:19.900 --> 08:22.118
SHANA?
ARE YOU FOLLOWING ME?

08:22.160 --> 08:23.559
I HAVE A MESSAGE FOR YOU.

08:30.970 --> 08:32.870
ALISON'S DEAD.

08:32.910 --> 08:33.808
ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU TOLD
SPENCER AT THE HOSPITAL?

08:34.880 --> 08:36.006
WE BOTH KNOW
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

08:36.040 --> 08:38.247
SHE WANTS YOU GUYS
TO STOP LOOKING FOR HER.

08:38.280 --> 08:40.976
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.
YOU ALMOST GOT HER KILLED
AT THE INN LAST NIGHT.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.908
WHY WOULD I BELIEVE
ANYTHING YOU HAVE TO SAY?

08:42.950 --> 08:45.248
YOU DIDN'T KNOW ALISON.
LISTEN, EMILY...

08:45.290 --> 08:47.258
I'VE KNOWN HER
SINCE I WAS THREE.

08:47.290 --> 08:49.622
I GREW UP NEXT DOOR
TO HER GRANDPARENTS
IN GEORGIA.

08:49.660 --> 08:52.220
IF YOU KNEW ALISON,
YOU WOULDN'T
BE FRIENDS WITH JENNA.

08:52.260 --> 08:54.956
ALISON ASKED ME
TO COME TO ROSEWOOD
TO HELP FIGURE OUT

08:55.000 --> 08:58.595
WHO TRIED TO KILL HER.
JENNA'S ON THE LIST.

08:58.630 --> 09:01.064
KEEP YOUR FRIENDS CLOSE,
AND YOUR ENEMIES CLOSER.

09:02.810 --> 09:04.801
IF YOU REALLY ARE
TALKING TO HER...

09:04.840 --> 09:05.909
PROVE IT.

09:06.880 --> 09:10.646
RADLEY'S OFFERING
MY FAMILY A SETTLEMENT?

09:10.680 --> 09:12.841
THEY'RE NOT ADMITTING
ANY NEGLIGENCE ON THEIR PART,

09:12.880 --> 09:15.178
BUT THE ACCIDENT DID
HAPPEN ON THEIR PREMISES,

09:15.220 --> 09:17.586
SO THEY WANT TO GIVE
YOU AND YOUR FAMILY
SOMETHING FOR YOUR LOSS.

09:17.620 --> 09:19.759
WELL, WHAT HAPPENED
TO US TRYING TO
SHUT DOWN THE PLACE?

09:19.790 --> 09:22.759
I STILL WANT TO.
BUT AFTER LOOKING INTO IT,

09:22.790 --> 09:25.759
I JUST DON'T THINK
THERE'S ENOUGH EVIDENCE
TO SUBSTANTIATE A LAWSUIT.

09:25.790 --> 09:27.690
WE KNOW WILDEN
ALTERED THE FILE.

09:27.730 --> 09:29.322
YES, BUT HE'S DEAD.

09:29.360 --> 09:34.662
THERE'S NOBODY ELSE
WILLING TO TESTIFY
AGAINST RADLEY.

09:34.700 --> 09:38.101
LOOK, TOBY, I KNOW THIS
ISN'T WHAT YOU WANTED TO HEAR,

09:38.140 --> 09:41.598
BUT AT LEAST YOU FINALLY
KNOW THE TRUTH ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENED TO YOUR MOM.

09:45.380 --> 09:47.211
I SPOKE WITH YOUR FATHER.

09:49.350 --> 09:52.808
HE'S OPEN TO SIGNING
THE AGREEMENT.

09:52.860 --> 09:55.818
BUT IN ORDER
TO MOVE FORWARD,
YOU NEED TO SIGN, TOO.

10:02.930 --> 10:06.730
I KNOW IT'S NOT GOING
TO BRING YOUR MOTHER
BACK OR CHANGE THE PAST,

10:06.770 --> 10:08.692
BUT IT CAN HELP
YOUR FUTURE.

10:19.720 --> 10:22.018
HEY THERE, BEAUTIFUL.

10:22.050 --> 10:23.608
HI.

10:28.260 --> 10:30.854
OH, MY GOD.
WHAT HAPPENED?

10:30.890 --> 10:33.859
( laughs )
IT'S NOTHING.
NOTHING?

10:33.900 --> 10:36.391
YOU GOT A HUGE
GASH ABOVE YOUR EYE.

10:36.430 --> 10:39.763
WELL, COMES WITH
THE TERRITORY.

10:39.800 --> 10:41.631
BESIDES, YOU SHOULD'VE
SEEN THE OTHER GUY.

10:43.810 --> 10:45.766
I MISSED YOU.

10:45.810 --> 10:47.209
YEAH.
I MISSED YOU, TOO.

10:52.410 --> 10:55.846
YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD
LOOK INTO GETTING
A NEW ONE OF THESE.

10:57.950 --> 11:00.089
WELL, I'VE HAD IT
SINCE I WAS FIFTEEN.

11:00.120 --> 11:02.281
I PRACTICE WITH IT
BEFORE ALL MY BIG MEETS.

11:02.320 --> 11:05.027
KIND OF
A SUPERSTITIOUS THING.

11:05.060 --> 11:06.823
BROUGHT ME GOOD LUCK AGAIN.

11:08.330 --> 11:10.025
I QUALIFIED FOR NATIONALS.

11:10.070 --> 11:13.267
WOW. CONGRATULATIONS.
THAT'S AMAZING.

11:13.300 --> 11:15.291
I'M NOT REALLY SURPRISED.

11:15.340 --> 11:18.104
THAN KS.

11:18.140 --> 11:21.928
SO YOU HUNGRY?
YOU WANNA GRAB
SOMETHING TO EAT?

11:21.980 --> 11:23.777
SURE.

11:23.810 --> 11:25.675
OKAY.

11:27.820 --> 11:29.242
ACTUALLY, NO.

11:33.990 --> 11:35.685
YOU'RE NOT HUNGRY?

11:36.930 --> 11:39.319
I JUST--
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT SOMETHING.

11:42.300 --> 11:43.699
SOUNDS SERIOUS.

11:45.900 --> 11:47.367
KINDA IS.

11:50.510 --> 11:53.229
WHILE YOU WERE AWAY,
I...

11:53.280 --> 11:55.339
I WAS JUST DOING
SOME THINKING AND--

11:55.380 --> 11:57.769
YOU'RE BACK
WITH EZRA.

11:57.810 --> 11:58.970
AREN'T YOU?

12:00.350 --> 12:01.419
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

12:02.480 --> 12:04.812
YOU TOLD ME
THE KID WASN'T HIS.

12:04.850 --> 12:06.852
YOU'VE BEEN
DISTANT ON THE PHONE.

12:09.160 --> 12:12.857
COME ON, ARIA.
I CAN HANDLE THE TRUTH.

12:14.860 --> 12:16.725
I'M SORRY, JAKE.

12:20.870 --> 12:23.202
I DON'T GET IT.
I THOUGHT THINGS WERE
GOING SO WELL BETWEEN US.

12:23.240 --> 12:25.333
WELL, THEY WERE.

12:25.370 --> 12:27.509
I LOVE SPENDING
TIME WITH YOU.
JUST...

12:27.540 --> 12:29.849
NOT AS MUCH AS WITH HIM.

12:31.550 --> 12:35.008
EZRA AND I HAVE
A LONG HISTORY TOGETHER.

12:38.420 --> 12:41.287
I HOPE WE CAN
STILL BE FRIENDS.

12:44.890 --> 12:47.154
I'M GONNA NEED
A LITTLE TIME FOR THAT.

12:52.900 --> 12:56.131
THERE'S A GAG
CLAUSE IN THIS.

12:56.170 --> 12:58.206
IF YOU SIGN THIS,
YOU'RE AGREEING TO
NEVER TALK ABOUT

12:58.240 --> 13:00.003
WHAT HAPPENED TO
YOUR MOTHER AT RADLEY.

13:00.040 --> 13:02.406
NOT TO THE POLICE,
NOT THE PRESS. NO ONE.

13:02.440 --> 13:03.873
I KNOW.
AND IF YOU DO,

13:03.910 --> 13:07.038
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO GIVE BACK ALL THIS MONEY
PLUS A HUGE PENALTY.

13:07.080 --> 13:10.140
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
YOUR DAD MADE IT CLEAR
WE DON'T HAVE A CASE.

13:11.920 --> 13:14.013
YEAH, A LITTLE TOO CLEAR.

13:14.060 --> 13:15.550
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

13:15.590 --> 13:17.558
ONE MINUTE HE WANTS
TO SHUT DOWN RADLEY,

13:17.590 --> 13:19.899
AND THE NEXT HE WANTS
TO SHUT DOWN YOU.

13:19.930 --> 13:22.251
MY MOM FELL, SPENCER.
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

13:22.300 --> 13:24.268
HOW DO WE KNOW
THAT FOR SURE?

13:24.300 --> 13:27.428
WE STILL DON'T
KNOW WHY SHE WAS UP
THERE UNSUPERVISED,

13:27.470 --> 13:30.906
OR WHO THIS "FRAGILE"
PATIENT WAS WITH HER.

13:32.640 --> 13:35.370
YOUR DAD ALSO SAID
THAT IF WE WENT TO COURT,

13:35.410 --> 13:38.504
STUFF ABOUT MY MOM'S
PAST WOULD BE DUG UP.

13:39.610 --> 13:41.214
IT COULD GET UGLY.

13:41.250 --> 13:45.516
LOOK, TOBY,
I'M NOT SAYING THAT
YOU SHOULDN'T SIGN THIS.

13:45.550 --> 13:50.578
BUT YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE
YOU HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION
YOU NEED BEFORE YOU DO.

13:54.660 --> 13:57.163
I TOLD SHANA TO FIND OUT
WHAT ALI HAD SAID TO ME

13:57.200 --> 13:58.861
WHEN SHE PULLED ME
OUT OF THE BARN.

13:58.900 --> 14:00.492
WHEN WE WERE LOOKING
FOR DR. SULLIVAN?

14:02.600 --> 14:04.261
WHAT DID ALI SAY TO YOU?

14:04.310 --> 14:07.973
UH, THAT'S SOMETHING
I WANT TO KEEP
JUST BETWEEN US.

14:09.240 --> 14:11.071
WELL, SHANA'S
OBVIOUSLY LYING.

14:11.110 --> 14:13.044
I MEAN, ALI NEVER
MENTIONED HER NAME ONCE.

14:13.080 --> 14:16.140
THERE WERE A LOT OF
PEOPLE IN ALI'S LIFE
WE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT.

14:16.180 --> 14:18.944
Spencer:
WAIT, SHANA KNEW PAIGE FIRST?

14:18.990 --> 14:22.209
SO WHAT ARE WE SAYING, THAT
PAIGE IS ON ALI'S LIST, TOO?

14:22.260 --> 14:24.353
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE.

14:24.390 --> 14:27.621
EVEN IF THEY WERE FRIENDS,
WHY WOULD ALI TRUST
SHANA MORE THAN US?

14:27.660 --> 14:30.322
WE WERE HER BEST FRIENDS.
ARE YOU FORGETTING?

14:30.370 --> 14:32.361
SOMEONE'S BEEN TORMENTING
US FOR YEARS.

14:32.400 --> 14:34.265
MAKING OUR LIVES MISERABLE,
ONE TEXT AT A TIME.

14:35.440 --> 14:37.499
I THINK SHANA'S WHO WE
ALWAYS THOUGHT SHE WAS:

14:37.540 --> 14:39.508
ONE OF "A'S" MINIONS.

14:39.540 --> 14:41.428
AND IF "A" WANTS US
TO STOP LOOKING FOR ALI,

14:41.480 --> 14:44.347
THEN THAT MUST MEAN ALI
WASN'T HURT LAST NIGHT.

14:44.380 --> 14:46.678
SO, "A" WANTS US TO
BELIEVE SHANA'S STORY
SO WE STOP LOOKING

14:46.710 --> 14:48.917
FOR ALI AND HE
CAN FIND HER.

14:51.720 --> 14:53.517
COME ON, EM.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.983
YOU DON'T SERIOUSLY
BELIEVE THAT SHANA
MOVED ALL THE WAY UP

14:56.020 --> 14:58.250
FROM GEORGIA SO SHE
COULD HUNT DOWN
THE PERSON WHO TRIED

14:58.290 --> 15:00.429
TO KILL HER CHILDHOOD
FRIEND, DO YOU?

15:02.000 --> 15:04.423
ALI COULD MAKE SOMEONE
LOVE HER ENOUGH TO DO THAT.

15:10.170 --> 15:11.899
HEY.
HI.

15:13.180 --> 15:17.048
I FIGURED
YOU'D WANT THIS BACK.
THANK YOU.

15:17.080 --> 15:18.570
WHAT HAPPENED IN HERE?

15:18.610 --> 15:20.544
OH, A WATER PIPE BURST
IN THE BASEMENT.

15:20.580 --> 15:23.686
SO THIS IS WHERE
EVERYTHING'S KIND OF
LIVING HERE FOR NOW.

15:23.720 --> 15:25.347
THIS IS A NICE
POOL TABLE.

15:25.390 --> 15:27.085
WE USED TO HAVE ONE
LIKE IT IN MY HOUSE.

15:27.120 --> 15:29.281
YEAH, MY DAD LEFT IT HERE.

15:29.320 --> 15:32.255
I NEVER REALLY
PLAYED MUCH, THOUGH.

15:32.290 --> 15:35.054
SO, I WAS...
I WAS GONNA
CALL YOU TODAY.

15:35.100 --> 15:36.692
CHECK IN,
SEE HOW YOU'RE DOING.

15:36.730 --> 15:39.927
OH, I'M GOOD.
YEAH, I'M REALLY GOOD.

15:41.570 --> 15:42.559
UM, DO YOU HAVE
TO BE SOMEWHERE?

15:42.600 --> 15:45.330
OR CAN YOU STICK AROUND
TO PLAY A GAME OR TWO?

15:46.510 --> 15:49.172
YEAH. SURE, WHY NOT?

15:49.210 --> 15:50.609
DO YOU WANNA RACK
THEM OR SHOULD I?

15:50.650 --> 15:52.208
YOU GOT IT.

15:55.680 --> 15:58.240
ALI SAID SHE MISSED
YOU THE MOST.

15:58.290 --> 15:59.689
YOU WERE HER FAVORITE.

15:59.720 --> 16:03.053
NOBODY LOVED HER
AS MUCH AS YOU.

16:03.090 --> 16:06.958
SHE GAVE YOU A CHOICE.
TO STAY OR TO GO WITH HER.

16:07.760 --> 16:10.968
BEFORE SHE LEFT,
SHE KISSED YOU.

16:16.240 --> 16:19.107
WHERE IS SHE?
WHERE IS ALI?

16:19.140 --> 16:23.099
I NEVER KNOW.
SHE'S ALWAYS ON THE MOVE.
SHE FINDS ME.

16:23.150 --> 16:25.300
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
KNOWN THAT SHE'S ALIVE?

16:25.350 --> 16:27.375
SINCE MONA
WENT TO RADLEY.

16:29.280 --> 16:31.441
YOU'VE KNOWN
THIS WHOLE TIME?

16:31.490 --> 16:34.084
WHY DID SHE...
SHE COME TO YOU?

16:34.120 --> 16:38.079
SHE WANTS TO MEET YOU,
EMILY. TONIGHT.

16:38.130 --> 16:39.757
BUT YOU HAVE
TO GO ALONE.

16:39.790 --> 16:41.724
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
IT'LL BE SAFE.

16:43.600 --> 16:46.160
WHY ME?

16:46.200 --> 16:47.736
I GUESS YOU REALLY
WERE HER FAVORITE.

16:55.810 --> 16:57.471
THAT'S NOT THE BALL
YOU WANNA TRY AND SINK.

16:57.510 --> 16:59.649
YOU'RE STRIPES,
REMEMBER?

16:59.680 --> 17:02.615
WELL, I WAS JUST GIVING
YOU A HEAD START.
( chuckles )

17:09.420 --> 17:12.355
I'M SURPRISED YOU'RE
IN SUCH A GOOD MOOD.

17:12.390 --> 17:13.254
I WAS WORRIED ABOUT
YOU LAST NIGHT.

17:13.300 --> 17:16.394
NO, I JUST HAD TO GET IT
OUT OF MY SYSTEM.

17:17.830 --> 17:20.139
YOU KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE
TO PUT UP A FRONT WITH ME.

17:20.170 --> 17:22.035
ARE YOU GONNA LET ME
HIT MY STRIPES OR NOT?

17:27.340 --> 17:29.205
GOD, WHAT AM
I DOING WRONG?
OKAY.

17:30.850 --> 17:33.717
HERE. LET ME SHOW YOU.

17:33.750 --> 17:37.584
FIRST OF ALL,
YOU'RE HOLDING YOUR
STICK WAY TOO LOW.

17:37.620 --> 17:41.818
ONCE YOU GET THE ANGLE
THAT YOU WANT...

17:41.860 --> 17:45.682
YOU JUST, UM,
YOU JUST TAKE THE SHOT.

17:49.460 --> 17:51.792
WOW. SEE?
NOT BAD.

17:52.870 --> 17:55.338
WATCH OUT, TRAVIS.
I'M COMING FOR YOU.

17:56.840 --> 17:59.308
SHANA KNEW THE CONVERSATION
WE HAD OUTSIDE THE BARN.

17:59.340 --> 18:00.637
WORD FOR WORD.

18:00.680 --> 18:03.604
WELL, "A" HAS A WAY OF
KNOWING THINGS THAT
SEEM IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW.

18:03.650 --> 18:05.845
I LOOKED INTO IT AND
HER STORY CHECKS OUT.

18:05.880 --> 18:09.179
SHANA DID GROW UP
NEXT DOOR TO
ALI'S GRANDPARENTS.

18:09.220 --> 18:11.848
THAT DOESN'T MEAN SHE'S
IN CONTACT WITH HER NOW.

18:11.890 --> 18:13.585
LOOK, I TOOK PICTURES
OF SOME OF THE STORIES

18:13.620 --> 18:15.417
IN ALI'S JOURNAL
BEFORE "A" GOT IT.

18:15.460 --> 18:17.587
AND THERE ARE DESCRIPTIONS
OF OTHER PLACES THAT
SHE COULD BE HIDING.

18:17.630 --> 18:19.120
WE CAN KEEP LOOKING.

18:21.160 --> 18:22.855
ALI WANTS
TO MEET ME TONIGHT.

18:24.370 --> 18:27.362
LIKE SHE WANTED
TO MEET YOU AT THE
KISSING ROCK YESTERDAY?

18:27.400 --> 18:29.459
SHE NEEDS OUR HELP,
SPENCE.

18:29.500 --> 18:31.206
DID SHANA TELL YOU THIS?

18:35.440 --> 18:38.705
LOOK, EVEN IF THIS
WERE TRUE,

18:38.750 --> 18:40.741
WHY WOULD ALI ONLY
WANT TO MEET WITH YOU?

18:40.780 --> 18:42.919
I DON'T KNOW.

18:42.950 --> 18:45.839
MAYBE "A" CAN'T
WATCH ALL OF US
ALL THE TIME.

18:45.890 --> 18:48.859
LOOK, I KNOW YOU WANNA
BELIEVE THAT THIS IS
ALISON REACHING OUT TO YOU,

18:48.890 --> 18:51.529
BUT IT'S NOT ALI, OKAY?
THIS IS "A".

18:51.560 --> 18:53.699
I DON'T THINK SO.
NOT THIS TIME.

18:53.730 --> 18:56.756
JUST BECAUSE SHANA KNOWS
ABOUT THIS ONE CONVERSATION
YOU AND ALI HAD?

18:56.800 --> 18:58.722
YES.

19:00.270 --> 19:01.760
WELL, YOU'RE NOT
GOING ALONE.

19:01.800 --> 19:04.667
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
SHE'LL MEET ME.

19:04.710 --> 19:08.305
SPENCER, I TOLD YOU
BECAUSE I DIDN'T
WANT TO LIE TO YOU.

19:08.340 --> 19:10.501
OKAY? DON'T MAKE ME
SORRY THAT I DID.

20:00.860 --> 20:03.761
SOMEBODY'S GETTING
THE ROYAL TREATMENT.

20:03.800 --> 20:05.961
WELL, YOUR MOM WILL
BE HOME SOON.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.831
I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING
SPECIAL FOR HER.

20:07.870 --> 20:10.566
I WOULD HAVE JUST
GONE FOR JEWELRY
INSTEAD OF ROASTED DUCK.

20:10.610 --> 20:13.306
BUT THAT'S JUST ME.

20:13.340 --> 20:14.830
I'M HOPING YOU'LL JOIN US.

20:14.880 --> 20:18.475
I THINK WE ALL COULD
USE A NICE FAMILY
NIGHT TOGETHER.

20:21.950 --> 20:24.282
TOBY TOLD ME ABOUT
THE SETTLEMENT, DAD.

20:25.620 --> 20:27.713
YEAH, IT'S A DECENT
AMOUNT OF MONEY.

20:27.760 --> 20:30.684
IT'S NOT MONEY
THAT HE'S AFTER.

20:30.730 --> 20:34.598
A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO
HE WAS READY TO SETTLE
FOR A LETTER OF APOLOGY.

20:34.630 --> 20:35.790
MUSHROOM PUFF?

20:35.830 --> 20:38.799
NO, THANKS. I TRY
TO STAY AWAY FROM FUNGUS.

20:43.670 --> 20:46.662
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU TO BACK
AWAY FROM A CASE THIS QUICKLY.

20:48.340 --> 20:50.774
I JUST DID WHAT'S
BEST FOR TOBY'S FAMILY.

20:52.510 --> 20:54.273
DID YOU?

20:57.450 --> 20:59.714
WHY DON'T YOU LET ME
DEAL WITH MY CLIENTS,

20:59.750 --> 21:01.809
AND YOU WORRY JUST
ABOUT YOURSELF.

21:03.390 --> 21:04.880
NOW MAKE YOURSELF
USEFUL WHILE I'M SHOWERING

21:04.930 --> 21:07.751
AND PICK OUT SOME MUSIC
FOR DINNER.

21:07.800 --> 21:11.793
AND PLEASE, MAKE IT
SOMETHING HAPPY, UPBEAT.

21:18.370 --> 21:20.065
Ezra: I DON'T LIKE IT,
BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW

21:20.110 --> 21:23.568
YOU CAN MAKE SUCH A COLOSSAL
MISTAKE. DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

21:23.610 --> 21:25.646
DO YOU SEE HOW THIS IS--
THIS IS DIFFICULT?

21:25.680 --> 21:28.069
NO, LOOK AT ME!
LOOK AT ME WHEN
I'M TALKING TO YOU.

21:28.120 --> 21:30.315
THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

21:30.350 --> 21:31.988
YOU HAVE REALLY SCREWED UP.

21:32.020 --> 21:33.851
YOU HAVE REALLY SCREWED UP!

21:33.890 --> 21:35.915
OH, YES, PLEASE!
PLEASE DRIVE AWAY!

21:35.960 --> 21:38.679
THIS ISN'T OVER!

21:52.370 --> 21:53.598
FIVE IN A ROW.

21:53.640 --> 21:55.369
WOW, YOU'RE REALLY
KICKING MY ASS.

21:55.410 --> 21:59.346
WELL, IT'S EASY TO WIN
WHEN SOMEONE LETS YOU.

21:59.380 --> 22:01.541
ALL RIGHT,
IT'S GETTING LATE.

22:01.580 --> 22:03.810
I SHOULD
PROBABLY TAKE OFF.

22:03.850 --> 22:05.442
YEAH. WELL,
THIS WAS FUN.

22:05.490 --> 22:07.458
WE SHOULD DO IT
AGAIN SOON.

22:07.490 --> 22:08.787
REMATCH ANYTIME.

22:14.760 --> 22:18.628
SORRY. SORRY,
THAT WAS SO STUPID.

22:18.670 --> 22:20.968
OF COURSE YOU'RE NOT
INTO ME LIKE THAT.

22:21.000 --> 22:24.606
NO, LOOK...
IT'S NOT THAT.

22:26.470 --> 22:28.836
THEN WHAT?

22:28.880 --> 22:31.098
YOU'RE JUST GETTING OUT
OF A RELATIONSHIP.

22:31.150 --> 22:32.777
NO, I'M NOT
JUST GETTING OUT.

22:32.810 --> 22:35.040
I'M COMPLETELY OUT.
IT'S DONE.

22:37.990 --> 22:40.550
MAYBE WE SHOULD GIVE
THIS A LITTLE MORE TIME.

22:43.590 --> 22:46.582
**

23:45.520 --> 23:49.217
MOM. I THOUGHT
YOU WERE GOING OUT
AFTER WORK WITH TED.

23:49.260 --> 23:53.082
HE HAD TO CANCEL.
HELLO, TRAVIS.

23:53.130 --> 23:55.655
HI, MRS. MARIN.

23:55.700 --> 23:57.964
CAN I SPEAK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND, PLEASE?

24:10.910 --> 24:12.707
WHAT?

24:12.750 --> 24:15.617
I THOUGHT YOU AND TRAVIS
WERE JUST FRIENDS.

24:15.650 --> 24:16.947
WE ARE.

24:16.980 --> 24:18.584
YOU KISS ALL YOUR
FRIENDS LIKE THAT?

24:18.620 --> 24:20.042
DON'T JUDGE ME.

24:20.090 --> 24:22.012
I'M NOT JUDGING,
I'M CONCERNED.

24:23.730 --> 24:25.686
UH, SORRY TO INTERRUPT...
BUT I REALLY SHOULD GET GOING.

24:25.730 --> 24:28.551
GOOD IDEA.
NO, TRAVIS,
STAY HERE.

24:28.600 --> 24:30.488
I'LL CALL YOU TOMORROW.

24:30.530 --> 24:32.498
TRAVIS, YOU HAVE
A LITTLE...

24:32.530 --> 24:35.931
YEAH.
( chuckles )

24:38.010 --> 24:40.035
OKAY, ARE YOU SERIOUS?
YOU BASICALLY JUST
KICKED HIM OUT.

24:40.070 --> 24:41.799
YOU WILL THANK ME LATER.

24:41.840 --> 24:44.047
TRUST ME,
THROWING YOURSELF
AT A NEW GUY

24:44.080 --> 24:45.707
IS NOT THE WAY
TO GET OVER
THE OLD ONE.

24:45.750 --> 24:48.719
YOU'RE ONE
TO THROW STONES.

24:48.750 --> 24:52.083
OKAY. I KNOW THAT
YOU'RE HURTING RIGHT NOW,

24:52.120 --> 24:53.712
BUT IF YOU COULD
TAKE A STEP BACK,

24:53.760 --> 24:55.079
YOU'D SEE I'M JUST
TRYING TO HELP--

24:55.120 --> 24:57.588
I'M SICK OF EVERYONE
TELLING ME WHAT THEY
THINK I SHOULD

24:57.630 --> 24:59.655
AND SHOULDN'T DO
TO GET OVER CALEB.

24:59.690 --> 25:01.749
IT'S MY BROKEN HEART!

25:57.220 --> 25:59.313
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

25:59.350 --> 26:03.013
JESSICA DILAURENTIS
IS ON THE BOARD AT RADLEY?

26:03.060 --> 26:05.324
IS THIS WHY YOU'RE
PUSHING TOBY TO SIGN
THIS AGREEMENT?

26:05.360 --> 26:08.750
JESSICA BEING ON THE
BOARD HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH THE FACTS OF THE CASE.

26:08.800 --> 26:10.825
DID SHE TELL YOU THAT
TOBY'S MOTHER'S DEATH

26:10.870 --> 26:13.361
WAS AN ACCIDENT?
OR WAS THAT
YOUR BRILLIANT IDEA?

26:13.400 --> 26:14.367
SPENCER...

26:14.400 --> 26:16.960
( footsteps )

26:17.000 --> 26:18.934
I'M GOING TO
THE AIRPORT TO
PICK UP YOUR MOM.

26:18.970 --> 26:20.699
IF YOU'RE GONNA
CONTINUE TO ACT LIKE THIS,

26:20.740 --> 26:23.106
I SUGGEST YOU FIND
ANOTHER PLACE TO EAT DINNER.

26:24.810 --> 26:28.314
IS JASON EVEN IN REHAB?
OR DID YOU MAKE THAT UP, TOO?

26:28.350 --> 26:31.012
( departing footsteps )

26:33.390 --> 26:36.109
( dialing phone )

26:42.230 --> 26:44.095
TOBY, LISTEN.

26:44.130 --> 26:46.690
WHATEVER YOU DO,
DO NOT SIGN THAT AGREEMENT.

26:46.730 --> 26:47.936
OKAY? I'LL EXPLAIN IT
TO YOU LATER.

26:47.970 --> 26:50.188
JUST DON'T.

26:56.410 --> 26:59.607
**

27:05.850 --> 27:07.715
( knocking on door)

27:19.100 --> 27:22.035
PUT YOUR COAT ON.
WE'RE GOING OUT.

27:31.450 --> 27:33.304
Aria:
IT WAS 50
THOUGHTFUL OF YOU.

27:33.350 --> 27:34.977
KEEP IT.

27:36.450 --> 27:38.782
I CAN'T DO THAT.

27:38.820 --> 27:41.459
WHAT AM I GONNA DO WITH IT?

27:41.490 --> 27:43.287
I DON'T HAVE ANOTHER
ARIA IN MY LIFE.

27:46.260 --> 27:49.024
OKAY, WELL...

27:49.060 --> 27:51.062
THANK YOU.

27:55.770 --> 27:58.762
ALL RIGHT, I'LL LET
YOU GET BACK TO YOUR
JUMP ROPING.

28:06.850 --> 28:08.340
YOU KNOW,
I DO CARE ABOUT YOU.

28:10.750 --> 28:12.286
WHICH IS WHY IT'S HARD
FOR ME TO UNDERSTAND

28:12.320 --> 28:14.151
WHY YOU WANNA BE
WITH A GUY LIKE EZRA.

28:15.190 --> 28:17.215
WHAT DO YOU
MEAN BY THAT?

28:19.830 --> 28:20.819
NOTHING.

28:20.860 --> 28:22.828
NO, YOU WERE JUST ABOUT
TO TELL ME SOMETHING.

28:22.860 --> 28:23.861
WHAT?

28:24.900 --> 28:26.458
JAKE?

28:29.270 --> 28:33.161
I SAW HIM TOTALLY
GO OFF ON A WOMAN
OUTSIDE THE GRILLE TODAY.

28:33.210 --> 28:35.474
WHAT WOMAN?

28:35.510 --> 28:38.001
SOME BLONDE.
HE WAS SCREAMING AT HER

28:38.050 --> 28:39.972
AND POUNDING ON HER CAR.
THAT COULDN'T
HAVE BEEN EZRA.

28:40.010 --> 28:42.240
HE'S BEEN IN PHILLY
ALL DAY.
YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

28:47.450 --> 28:52.228
I ALWAYS WONDERED
IF EZRA WAS THE PERSON
YOU WERE AFRAID OF.

28:52.260 --> 28:54.421
I'M NOT AFRAID OF EZRA.

28:54.460 --> 28:56.223
WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD BE.
LOOK...

28:56.260 --> 28:59.320
THE EZRA I KNOW
DOESN'T HAVE A MEAN
BONE IN HIS BODY.

29:05.270 --> 29:07.158
YOU DO KNOW HIM BEST.

29:11.810 --> 29:16.144
JUST DO YOURSELF A FAVOR:
KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN.

29:27.430 --> 29:29.955
WHEN YOUR DAD LEFT ME
FOR ISABELLE,

29:30.000 --> 29:34.039
I WAS DEVASTATED.
AND FURIOUS.

29:34.070 --> 29:36.994
I WAS LASHING OUT
AT ALL THE WRONG PEOPLE.

29:37.040 --> 29:39.759
AND A FRIEND OF MINE
SUGGESTED THAT I COME HERE.

29:41.180 --> 29:42.579
TO THROW PLATES
AGAINST A WALL?

29:42.610 --> 29:44.407
YOU'D BE SURPRISED
HOW GOOD IT FEELS.

29:45.850 --> 29:47.272
'KAY? COME ON.

29:48.520 --> 29:50.886
GIVE IT A TRY.

29:50.920 --> 29:53.241
I DON'T SEE HOW THIS
WILL CHANGE THE FACT
THAT CALEB'S GONE.

29:53.290 --> 29:55.451
IT WON'T.

29:55.490 --> 29:57.253
BUT IT MIGHT HELP
YOU GET PAST THE ANGER.

29:59.030 --> 30:02.193
AND ONCE YOU DO,
I PROMISE YOU'LL START TO
LOOK AT THINGS DIFFERENTLY.

30:03.200 --> 30:04.189
OKAY?

30:04.230 --> 30:05.367
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE?

30:19.450 --> 30:20.974
SEE?

30:27.960 --> 30:30.053
( door opening )

30:34.030 --> 30:35.497
I WISH I COULD COME HOME
TO THIS EVERY NIGHT.

30:36.500 --> 30:38.092
SO YOU HAVE FUN WITH CURTIS?

30:38.130 --> 30:40.428
YEAH, IT WAS GREAT
CATCHING UP WITH HIM.

30:42.270 --> 30:46.331
YOU KNOW, I'M STARVING.
DO YOU WANT LIKE
PIZZA OR SOMETHING?

30:46.370 --> 30:47.928
YEAH, PIZZA SOUNDS GOOD.

30:47.980 --> 30:49.208
GREAT.

30:49.240 --> 30:51.470
DID YOU COME IN
ON THE LAST TRAIN?

30:51.510 --> 30:53.910
YEAH, I JUST MADE IT.

30:53.950 --> 30:56.612
UH, I'M GONNA WASH UP.

30:56.650 --> 30:58.481
JAKE SAW YOU TODAY.

31:03.390 --> 31:05.085
SAW ME WHERE?

31:05.130 --> 31:06.358
OUTSIDE THE GRILLE.

31:06.390 --> 31:08.028
SAID THAT YOU WERE
TALKING TO SOME WOMAN.

31:08.060 --> 31:11.621
ACTUALLY, HE USED
THE WORD SCREAMING.

31:15.140 --> 31:17.529
DID YOU EVEN
GO TO PHILADELPHIA?

31:19.170 --> 31:20.603
NO.

31:22.210 --> 31:24.007
WHO'S THE WOMAN,
EZRA?

31:25.580 --> 31:28.447
MAGGIE'S LAWYER.

31:28.480 --> 31:30.038
MAGGIE'S LAWYER?

31:30.080 --> 31:33.311
WHY WERE YOU
MEETING WITH HER?

31:33.350 --> 31:36.410
MAGGIE IS TRYING
TO PREVENT ME
FROM SEEING MALCOLM.

31:37.490 --> 31:40.527
I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT YOU WANTED THAT.

31:40.560 --> 31:41.652
JUST BECAUSE
HE'S NOT MY SON,

31:41.700 --> 31:43.452
DOESN'T MEAN
I DON'T CARE ABOUT HIM.

31:46.030 --> 31:47.691
SO, THAT'S WHAT
YOU WERE DOING ALL DAY?

31:47.730 --> 31:49.493
YOU WERE MEETING
WITH HER LAWYER?

31:49.540 --> 31:51.303
HER LAWYER. MY LAWYER.

31:51.340 --> 31:52.659
THE WHOLE THING
IS VERY COMPLICATED.

31:52.710 --> 31:54.928
BUT WHY WOULD YOU
KEEP THAT FROM ME?

31:54.980 --> 31:58.279
BECAUSE HAVING THEM IN
MY LIFE DESTROYED US ONCE.

31:58.310 --> 32:00.005
AND WE'RE JUST GETTING
OUR FOOTING BACK.

32:00.050 --> 32:03.349
I DIDN'T WANT TO
TAKE THE CHANCE THAT
THAT WOULD UPSET YOU.

32:05.450 --> 32:08.681
OKAY, THAT DOESN'T EXPLAIN
YOUR VIOLENT OUTBURST.

32:08.720 --> 32:11.325
I MEAN, JAKE SAID THAT
YOU REALLY SCARED THIS WOMAN.

32:12.290 --> 32:14.099
THE CONVERSATION
WAS HEATED.

32:14.130 --> 32:16.291
VOICES WERE RAISED.

32:16.330 --> 32:19.219
THERE WAS NOTHING
VIOLENT ABOUT IT.

32:19.270 --> 32:22.239
SO, EITHER JAKE
MISINTERPRETED
WHAT HE SAW,

32:22.270 --> 32:24.409
OR HE'S TRYING
TO MAKE ME LOOK BAD

32:24.440 --> 32:27.603
SO YOU'LL RETHINK
YOUR DECISION.

32:27.640 --> 32:31.144
EZRA, I REALLY
WANT THIS TO WORK.

32:31.180 --> 32:34.013
BUT IT'S GOING TO IF
WE'RE HONEST WITH EACH OTHER.

32:34.050 --> 32:37.076
I MADE A MISTAKE.

32:37.120 --> 32:38.678
I REALLY AM SORRY.

32:38.720 --> 32:42.508
LOOK, I CHOSE YOU KNOWING
ALL THAT COMES WITH IT.

32:44.660 --> 32:47.220
IT'S A CHOICE I'M REALLY
HAPPY THAT I MADE.

33:01.740 --> 33:03.731
YOU'RE NOT COMING IN?

34:14.350 --> 34:16.341
( distant bang )

34:23.460 --> 34:25.087
( sighing )

34:26.660 --> 34:28.218
IT'S REALLY YOU.

34:28.260 --> 34:30.490
YEAH, I'VE MISSED
YOU SO MUCH.

34:35.900 --> 34:39.233
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW HARD
IT'S BEEN TO STAY AWAY.

34:39.270 --> 34:41.579
THEN DON'T ANYMORE.

34:41.610 --> 34:43.237
LET ME HELP YOU.

34:43.280 --> 34:45.498
WE CAN GO TO THE POLICE.
OR YOUR PARENTS.

34:45.550 --> 34:48.678
I WISH I COULD.
I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHO I CAN TRUST.

34:48.720 --> 34:51.814
YOU CAN TRUST ME.
SPENCER, ARIA--

34:51.850 --> 34:53.317
I KNOW I CAN
TRUST YOU, EM.

34:53.350 --> 34:55.386
I'M JUST NOT
SURE ABOUT THEM.

34:55.420 --> 34:57.115
WHY?

34:59.530 --> 35:02.556
YOU NEVER STOPPED
CARING ABOUT ME, DID YOU?

35:02.600 --> 35:05.467
EVEN AFTER EVERYTHING
I PUT YOU THROUGH.

35:05.500 --> 35:08.196
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH
I REGRET HURTING YOU.

35:10.370 --> 35:12.600
IF I COULD DO IT
ALL OVER AGAIN, THINGS
WOULD BE SO DIFFERENT.

35:12.640 --> 35:16.633
WHO'S DOING THIS TO YOU?
TELL ME WHO YOU'RE HIDING FROM.

35:16.680 --> 35:20.548
I THOUGHT I KNEW.
BUT I WAS WRONG.

35:20.580 --> 35:22.241
THAT'S WHY I NEED YOU, EM.

35:22.280 --> 35:24.487
HELP ME FIND "A"
$0 I CAN COME HOME.

35:24.520 --> 35:26.738
SO THAT'S WHO YOU THINK
TRIED TO KILL YOU?

35:26.790 --> 35:28.485
( distant clattering )

35:28.520 --> 35:30.317
WHAT WAS THAT?

35:30.360 --> 35:32.351
WHO'S OUT THERE?

35:32.390 --> 35:34.255
DID YOU TELL ANYONE
ABOUT THIS?

35:35.500 --> 35:37.559
( clattering )

35:46.910 --> 35:47.899
Emily:
ALI, WAIT!

35:49.810 --> 35:52.779
ALI! PLEASE!
OPEN UP, ALI!

35:52.810 --> 35:54.914
ALI, OPEN UP, PLEASE!

35:54.950 --> 35:57.646
I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY.

35:57.680 --> 35:59.216
PLEASE ALI,
I JUST WANT TO TALK.

36:16.840 --> 36:19.900
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
HOW COULD SHE JUST
DISAPPEAR LIKE THAT?

36:19.940 --> 36:23.376
SHE DIDN'T DISAPPEAR.
YOU SCARED HER AWAY.

36:23.410 --> 36:25.275
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU FOLLOWED ME HERE.

36:25.310 --> 36:26.971
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
PUTTING YOURSELF IN DANGER.

36:27.010 --> 36:29.945
YEAH, WELL,
YOU THOUGHT WRONG.

36:29.980 --> 36:32.312
I KNOW. I'M SORRY.

36:32.350 --> 36:35.808
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO WORK HARDER THAN THAT.

36:35.860 --> 36:37.612
I BETRAYED ALISON.

36:37.660 --> 36:40.458
SHE'S NEVER GONNA
REACH OUT TO ME AGAIN.

36:41.530 --> 36:43.395
SHE'S STILL PLAYING
GAMES WITH US.

36:43.430 --> 36:44.920
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

36:44.970 --> 36:47.291
ALI SUCKED YOU BACK IN.

36:47.330 --> 36:49.890
SHE KNEW YOU WERE PULLING AWAY
AND THAT'S WHY SHE PICKED YOU.

36:49.940 --> 36:52.704
SHE WANTED TO MAKE YOU
FEEL SPECIAL SO THAT YOU
WOULDN'T GIVE UP ON HER.

36:52.740 --> 36:54.503
THAT'S SICK.
NO. IT'S BRILLIANT.

36:54.540 --> 36:56.929
IT WASN'T LIKE THAT,
OKAY? SHE WAS
DIFFERENT TONIGHT.

36:56.980 --> 36:59.369
SHE WAS SINCERE.
SHE CAN TRUST YOU,

36:59.410 --> 37:01.719
BUT SHE'S NOT SURE
ABOUT THE REST OF US?

37:01.750 --> 37:03.968
DON'T YOU GET IT?
SHE'S TRYING TO DIVIDE US.

37:04.020 --> 37:06.989
SHE WOULDN'T DO THAT.
WOULDN'T SHE?

37:07.020 --> 37:11.753
WAIT. YOU WERE LISTENING?
THIS WHOLE TIME?

37:12.760 --> 37:14.591
WE CAN'T LET HER
COME BETWEEN US.

37:14.630 --> 37:16.723
I'D SAY YOU'RE DOING
A GREAT JOB OF THAT
ALL ON YOUR OWN.

37:16.760 --> 37:18.261
I'M SORRY.
DON'T!

37:27.910 --> 37:30.629
WOW. THE GREEKS
REALLY KNOW
HOW TO LIVE.

37:30.680 --> 37:32.045
YOU WAN NA TH ROW
ANOTHER STACK?

37:32.080 --> 37:34.469
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
I'M JUST GETTING WARMED UP.

37:34.520 --> 37:36.647
ALL RIGHT.

37:36.680 --> 37:38.648
HEY, MOM?

37:38.690 --> 37:40.487
THAN KS.

37:40.520 --> 37:42.681
YOU'RE WELCOME.

37:47.660 --> 37:49.651
( plate demolishes )

37:53.470 --> 37:54.664
( door opens )

37:55.700 --> 37:58.032
HEY.

37:58.070 --> 37:59.560
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

38:00.770 --> 38:03.773
UM, JUST WITH EMILY.

38:03.810 --> 38:05.448
I GOT YOUR MESSAGE.

38:05.480 --> 38:09.849
YEAH, SO JESSICA
DILAURENTIS IS ON
THE BOARD AT RADLEY.

38:09.880 --> 38:14.453
AND THAT MUST BE
WHY MY DAD CHANGED--
I SIGNED THE AGREEMENT.

38:14.490 --> 38:16.788
WHAT?
WAIT WHEN?

38:16.820 --> 38:19.323
BEFORE I GOT YOUR MESSAGE.
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

38:19.360 --> 38:21.794
OF COURSE IT DOES.
MY DAD MANIPULATED
YOU INTO SIGNING IT.

38:21.830 --> 38:24.867
THAT MAY BE TRUE,
BUT MY DAD AND I HAD
A LONG TALK TODAY

38:24.900 --> 38:26.925
AND WE DECIDED
TO MOVE ON FROM THIS.

38:26.970 --> 38:29.063
IT'S THE BEST THING
FOR OUR FAMILY.
TOBY,

38:29.100 --> 38:32.069
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
THERE'S CLEARLY
SO MUCH MORE

38:32.110 --> 38:35.568
TO THIS COVER-UP
THAN WE KNOW.
WHAT I KNOW...

38:35.610 --> 38:38.943
IS MY MOTHER
DIDN'T KILL HERSELF.

38:38.980 --> 38:43.679
NOW WHETHER SHE FELL
OR SOME DISTURBED PATIENT
PUSHED HER DOESN'T MATTER.

38:43.720 --> 38:44.687
IT DOESN'T MATTER?

38:44.720 --> 38:46.711
HOW CAN IT NOT MATTER?
DON'T YOU WANT TO KNOW

38:46.750 --> 38:48.559
WHO THAT
DISTURBED PATIENT IS?

38:48.590 --> 38:50.478
STOP.

38:50.520 --> 38:54.650
LET IT GO, SPENCER.
IT'S OVER.

38:59.730 --> 39:02.790
**

39:57.690 --> 40:01.729
HEY.
IT'S ME, HANNA.

40:04.060 --> 40:07.166
I KEEP REPLAYING
THE PAST FEW WEEKS

40:07.200 --> 40:09.691
OVER AND OVER
AGAIN IN MY HEAD.

40:11.200 --> 40:14.806
TRYING TO PINPOINT
THE EXACT MOMENT I LOST YOU.

40:16.810 --> 40:21.747
WONDERING IF I COULD'VE
DONE SOMETHING DIFFERENTLY.

40:24.620 --> 40:28.716
BUT, I JUST WANTED
TO LET YOU KNOW THAT...

40:30.590 --> 40:32.979
IT WAS THE BEST YEAR
OF MY LIFE.

40:54.720 --> 40:56.676
HEY, YOU'RE JUST IN TIME.

40:56.720 --> 40:59.518
THAT Looks AMAZING.
( glggles )

41:31.720 --> 41:33.585
AH!

41:53.970 --> 41:55.779
EZRA:
( laughing )

41:55.810 --> 41:58.131
YOU HAVE()S|_C|)METHING...

41:58.180 --> 41:59.943
NO. I...
