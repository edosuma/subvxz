04:12.879 --> 04:13.919
What the fuck?

06:23.480 --> 06:25.160
Finally, woke up?

06:28.279 --> 06:30.040
I wanted to ask.

06:35.360 --> 06:36.560
No screaming.

06:38.879 --> 06:40.040
No screaming.

06:41.439 --> 06:42.600
No screaming.

07:06.160 --> 07:07.079
Phone, call...

07:07.920 --> 07:08.959
Hello, Tom.

07:08.959 --> 07:10.399
How are you today?

07:33.240 --> 07:35.519
What're you
doing with all my stuff?

07:46.839 --> 07:49.639
Checking if anyone is listening.

07:50.959 --> 07:53.040
Those things take forever to set up.

07:55.439 --> 07:57.759
It wouldn't shut up.

07:57.759 --> 07:58.600
That's fair.

08:01.279 --> 08:03.639
I'm sure that tells you
where I went to school.

08:04.720 --> 08:06.839
That's not about you.

08:08.319 --> 08:11.040
It doesn't say what to
do with you either.

08:11.160 --> 08:13.920
Don't have the kill if
they bother you training.

08:14.399 --> 08:16.040
Not ex-KGB then.

08:17.399 --> 08:18.879
No, too young.

08:20.199 --> 08:21.120
No, you are,

08:23.040 --> 08:24.879
what does Putin call it now?

08:30.079 --> 08:32.240
Anyway, not good news for me.

08:34.600 --> 08:37.000
You would've killed me
already if you wanted to.

08:38.080 --> 08:41.759
Shot to the knee won't kill you.

08:47.639 --> 08:50.120
Can I have a glass of water?

09:20.200 --> 09:21.120
Much better.

09:21.679 --> 09:22.519
Okay,

09:23.240 --> 09:24.080
so,

09:25.120 --> 09:27.759
what the fuck is happening?!

09:27.919 --> 09:30.320
You turn up in my bedroom
in the middle of the night

09:30.320 --> 09:31.679
out of goddamn nowhere!

09:31.679 --> 09:35.360
Stop screaming!

09:38.720 --> 09:40.639
I thought you would know what to do.

09:42.320 --> 09:44.120
They didn't tell me you would attack me.

09:55.200 --> 09:57.759
Do you at least know who I am?

09:59.320 --> 10:00.320
You are,

10:02.399 --> 10:03.879
we are.

10:22.320 --> 10:23.559
Where did you get that?

10:23.559 --> 10:24.919
Must be 30 years old.

10:26.159 --> 10:27.360
And it's mine.

10:27.799 --> 10:29.759
How did you get my old
identification documents?

10:29.759 --> 10:31.080
Look at the picture.

11:01.759 --> 11:04.279
Are you sure you're
not my nephew or something?

11:04.480 --> 11:05.919
Do you have any siblings?

11:06.399 --> 11:08.240
No, no, I don't.

11:15.960 --> 11:17.200
Is this necessary?

11:17.200 --> 11:18.039
You tried to attack me.

11:18.039 --> 11:20.240
That's not even the
worse thing I did today.

11:20.240 --> 11:21.200
What do you mean?

11:21.279 --> 11:23.600
You're the third person
to appear in my room.

11:26.320 --> 11:27.480
So you killed them.

11:31.120 --> 11:32.440
Like you tried to kill me.

11:42.720 --> 11:43.639
Maybe you're crazy.

11:43.639 --> 11:45.080
Maybe somebody fucked with your mind.

11:45.080 --> 11:46.919
My name is Tomas Mraz.

11:46.919 --> 11:48.000
I was born in Prague in...

11:48.000 --> 11:50.960
Oh, seriously, how hard
is it to rehearse that?

11:52.759 --> 11:54.639
If you're me from the past,

11:54.759 --> 11:56.759
I would get a scar
where you cut yourself.

11:56.759 --> 11:58.639
You must be at least
40 years older than me.

11:58.639 --> 11:59.840
Excuse me, are you 10?

11:59.840 --> 12:01.039
I am 25.

12:01.039 --> 12:02.240
You think I'm nearly 70?

12:02.240 --> 12:03.240
It doesn't matter.

12:03.840 --> 12:06.399
The point is, I must cut
off a finger or something

12:06.440 --> 12:07.639
to have a scar that big.

12:09.039 --> 12:10.600
Do you have any scars that old?

12:11.159 --> 12:14.360
I have a scar from when I
stepped on a nail when I as 5.

12:41.279 --> 12:42.120
That's

12:43.360 --> 12:44.240
interesting.

13:25.080 --> 13:27.039
So walk me through it again.

13:27.039 --> 13:27.879
Walk where?

13:28.399 --> 13:29.759
Explain what happened.

13:30.039 --> 13:30.919
How can you be...

13:30.919 --> 13:32.279
They didn't explain the technicalities.

13:32.279 --> 13:33.080
Who's they?

13:33.080 --> 13:34.039
The doctors.

13:34.720 --> 13:36.639
They didn't experiment, I volunteered

13:37.679 --> 13:39.919
to defend our country and socialism.

13:44.960 --> 13:46.159
Oh, you're serious?

13:47.080 --> 13:48.200
I guess you would be.

13:48.200 --> 13:51.200
I would be back in 1980-something.

13:51.200 --> 13:52.919
1987.

13:54.200 --> 13:56.120
I was hand-picked from my regiment

13:56.120 --> 13:58.320
and sent to the Ukraine to participate

13:58.320 --> 14:00.720
in a very, very important experiment.

14:00.720 --> 14:03.960
And what was the point
of this amazing experiment?

14:04.519 --> 14:07.639
To ensure our country's
prosperity under socialism.

14:18.120 --> 14:20.840
First of all, you may have
noticed we are in London.

14:21.159 --> 14:22.720
I thought that's where this is.

14:22.720 --> 14:23.720
Are you here with the government?

14:23.720 --> 14:25.480
What government?

14:28.480 --> 14:29.519
I mean, I had to.

14:30.039 --> 14:31.960
What did he do to
persuade you to come here?

14:31.960 --> 14:33.159
What did he give you?

14:33.159 --> 14:34.000
He didn't.

14:34.000 --> 14:34.799
An apartment?

14:35.200 --> 14:36.399
An apartment?

14:36.519 --> 14:37.639
And a bottomless bar.

14:38.279 --> 14:39.399
Is that all it took?

14:39.639 --> 14:40.840
I can't believe you, of all people...

14:40.840 --> 14:41.679
He died.

14:44.320 --> 14:45.519
I don't care.

14:46.679 --> 14:48.600
He is the reason I never
had a proper family.

14:48.600 --> 14:50.519
Soviet tanks in the
streets is the reason

14:50.519 --> 14:53.159
you never had a proper
family, you brainwashed fuck!

14:53.159 --> 14:55.559
You defected!

14:58.000 --> 14:59.080
You defected.

15:02.799 --> 15:05.519
I don't speak to capitalist swine!

15:07.559 --> 15:09.320
It's 2018!

15:09.759 --> 15:11.759
Everybody is a capitalist swine!

15:16.600 --> 15:18.399
And I need the toilet!

16:12.519 --> 16:15.200
I really need the toilet!

16:24.200 --> 16:25.919
I need to take a piss!

16:25.919 --> 16:27.399
Stop acting like a child.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.279
What do you think you're
getting out of this?

16:41.600 --> 16:43.799
Are you gonna make me piss my pants?

16:44.559 --> 16:46.279
Wouldn't be the first time for me.

16:57.519 --> 16:58.360
See?

16:58.919 --> 17:01.000
It's not so hard to be a little bit nicer.

17:54.440 --> 17:55.400
What's so funny?

18:00.640 --> 18:02.000
Nothing, nothing.

18:03.200 --> 18:04.559
You're very close.

18:04.559 --> 18:06.079
You don't know what I'm looking for.

18:06.079 --> 18:08.359
I heard you talking to
the coffee maker earlier.

18:08.359 --> 18:09.880
You were trying to make a call.

18:10.200 --> 18:11.039
And?

18:11.279 --> 18:12.160
I can help.

18:13.880 --> 18:14.960
I can't trust you.

18:16.279 --> 18:18.359
You have been turned to the other side.

18:19.160 --> 18:20.240
That's not true.

18:21.880 --> 18:24.119
I guess, it kind of is.

18:25.640 --> 18:27.400
Anyway, I can tell you that the phone

18:27.400 --> 18:29.359
is one the side in the kitchen.

18:55.559 --> 18:56.680
Fuck you.

18:57.160 --> 18:59.039
I'm sorry, sorry.

18:59.599 --> 19:00.680
It's the other one.

19:10.200 --> 19:12.640
You need to touch the screen.

19:12.799 --> 19:13.960
I knew that.

19:18.359 --> 19:19.559
I can unlock that.

19:19.640 --> 19:20.799
Show you how to put in a number.

19:20.799 --> 19:22.480
How would you do that?

19:23.599 --> 19:25.200
I'm not exactly enjoying this.

19:31.640 --> 19:34.000
Do you wanna make that call?

20:10.400 --> 20:11.240
Did it work?

20:14.240 --> 20:15.079
So, no.

20:17.640 --> 20:18.880
How am I a threat to you?

20:18.880 --> 20:19.720
You have the gun.

20:20.240 --> 20:22.359
You must realize by now I have
no secret backup to call on.

20:22.359 --> 20:24.759
I can't exactly call the police.

20:25.720 --> 20:27.799
There is nothing I can do to you.

20:32.440 --> 20:34.519
I can, however, make coffee.

20:39.960 --> 20:41.799
Oh look, you figured out how to make

20:41.799 --> 20:43.079
an international phone call.

20:43.079 --> 20:43.920
What?

20:44.279 --> 20:45.640
You entered a dialing code.

20:45.640 --> 20:47.319
I'm not from the stone age.

20:47.319 --> 20:48.839
I know what phone numbers are.

20:48.920 --> 20:50.079
These are Russian anyway.

20:50.079 --> 20:50.920
So?

20:50.920 --> 20:52.880
I thought you said
you were in the Ukraine.

20:53.039 --> 20:53.839
Yes.

20:54.079 --> 20:55.079
Still the U.S.S.R.

21:17.039 --> 21:19.359
But socialism lasts forever.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.400
This brings me back.

21:22.319 --> 21:23.160
What happened?

21:24.680 --> 21:26.319
The people took to the streets.

21:26.799 --> 21:28.400
I don't know, I was in the army.

21:29.039 --> 21:30.839
At a certain point, the
generals stopped calling them

21:30.839 --> 21:32.799
"enemies of the state"
and started calling them

21:32.799 --> 21:33.680
"the government."

21:35.319 --> 21:36.519
And then my father died.

21:37.359 --> 21:38.799
This can't be the future.

21:40.400 --> 21:42.240
This can't be how I live.

21:42.960 --> 21:43.799
Thanks.

21:44.720 --> 21:46.480
There must've been a big mistake.

21:47.079 --> 21:48.359
I must fix the machine

21:48.559 --> 21:50.559
and then someone will come
and explain everything

21:50.559 --> 21:51.960
and everything will be fine.

21:53.039 --> 21:54.160
Sounds like a plan.

22:03.519 --> 22:06.000
I think I'll try to go to bed.

23:08.400 --> 23:10.079
What did you do?

23:10.480 --> 23:11.359
Did you steal this?

23:11.359 --> 23:12.200
Get off me!

23:12.359 --> 23:13.960
- Who is that?
- They followed.

23:19.319 --> 23:21.000
They followed me from the store.

23:28.160 --> 23:31.000
Did you fix whatever you've
got hidden in your brief case?

23:31.000 --> 23:33.480
I took a nap and I went to go buy food.

23:33.559 --> 23:34.400
You don't have any food here.

23:34.400 --> 23:37.720
I get stuff delivered.

23:38.319 --> 23:39.480
Are you crazy?

23:40.119 --> 23:41.119
It could be a spy.

23:41.119 --> 23:42.279
Or it could be the only person who knows

23:42.279 --> 23:43.880
what the fuck is happening here.

23:57.880 --> 23:58.799
Can I help you?

23:59.640 --> 24:01.000
Where is the younger one?

24:01.400 --> 24:02.279
What did he do?

24:02.279 --> 24:04.160
You said you didn't rob the store.

24:04.160 --> 24:06.240
I don't know
what you are talking about.

24:06.240 --> 24:07.200
This lady...

24:07.400 --> 24:08.240
Drop the act.

24:08.720 --> 24:10.240
I know what is happening here.

24:10.559 --> 24:11.960
Finally, someone.

24:11.960 --> 24:13.359
I am so confused.

24:13.359 --> 24:14.519
He barely speaks Czech.

24:14.519 --> 24:15.839
I choose not to!

24:16.200 --> 24:18.519
Plenty of our people
that are now like this,

24:18.880 --> 24:21.119
they think we wasted their life.

24:21.960 --> 24:22.799
They sulk.

24:22.799 --> 24:24.000
I am not sulking.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.559
I think he's a drunk.

24:25.680 --> 24:27.039
Shut up, you don't know shit.

24:27.039 --> 24:28.200
You have more alcohol in here

24:28.200 --> 24:30.240
than I've drunk in my entire life.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.160
That's my best bottle.

24:33.160 --> 24:34.559
How did she know?

24:34.559 --> 24:36.640
How do you hide all this stuff?

24:38.039 --> 24:39.200
Who are you?

24:49.599 --> 24:51.279
I have always enjoyed this view.

24:56.920 --> 24:58.640
So neither of you remembers me.

24:59.920 --> 25:00.720
Should I?

25:02.039 --> 25:02.960
Some of you did.

25:03.000 --> 25:03.920
Some of?

25:04.200 --> 25:05.400
What do you mean?

25:05.400 --> 25:07.359
I mean, I've traveled in time before

25:08.240 --> 25:09.880
to meet different versions of you

25:10.720 --> 25:12.880
and other people we
send on these missions.

25:13.000 --> 25:13.880
We, who's we?

25:13.880 --> 25:14.720
None of your business, who.

25:14.720 --> 25:15.960
Like you know anything.

25:15.960 --> 25:16.960
I know what my mission is.

25:16.960 --> 25:18.960
The Soviet government.

25:19.599 --> 25:21.400
I work for the Soviet government.

25:22.960 --> 25:24.880
The Soviet government sent me here.

25:26.079 --> 25:27.720
The Soviet government employs you.

25:27.720 --> 25:28.559
I know that.

25:28.680 --> 25:30.599
Well, con-fucking-gratulations.

25:31.359 --> 25:32.200
You two are definitely

25:32.200 --> 25:34.119
the most annoying versions of yourselves.

25:34.119 --> 25:35.519
Certainly more
annoying than the other two.

25:35.519 --> 25:37.720
At least they had the
decency to get killed.

25:38.599 --> 25:39.440
Excuse me?

25:40.920 --> 25:42.720
He says he killed the
two that came before me.

25:42.720 --> 25:43.839
I think he is lying.

25:45.319 --> 25:46.519
And you remember them?

25:47.680 --> 25:48.519
Yes.

25:49.079 --> 25:49.880
And you?

25:49.880 --> 25:51.599
I don't remember getting killed, no.

25:53.240 --> 25:55.519
Is this the first time
you traveled in time?

25:56.880 --> 25:59.079
What year did you come from?

25:59.799 --> 26:00.640
1987.

26:00.720 --> 26:02.279
Where is your device?

26:05.440 --> 26:06.279
It's hidden.

26:06.519 --> 26:08.079
It hasn't left the apartment.

26:08.799 --> 26:10.720
You don't seem to
have any trouble remembering.

26:10.720 --> 26:12.160
I have a special device.

26:12.920 --> 26:14.559
I don't forget the loops I close.

26:14.640 --> 26:15.440
Loops?

26:15.839 --> 26:16.680
Crossovers.

26:17.680 --> 26:19.880
They are the result of
the temporal paradox.

26:23.519 --> 26:25.319
The Grandfather Paradox?

26:34.640 --> 26:35.480
I'm sure you could just tell us.

26:35.480 --> 26:37.079
It would take a lot less time.

26:38.119 --> 26:39.599
It's better if you see.

26:40.640 --> 26:42.799
You can refill my glass in the meantime.

26:52.400 --> 26:53.240
So?

26:53.720 --> 26:56.119
You are going to show us
the Grandfather Paradox

26:56.319 --> 26:57.680
without any grandfathers.

26:58.319 --> 27:00.759
It's just the most common
name for the problem.

27:00.920 --> 27:03.960
It's actually a time
travel theory paradox.

27:04.559 --> 27:06.279
So how are you going to show us?

27:07.759 --> 27:08.680
A time machine.

27:14.759 --> 27:15.559
Sit down.

27:29.200 --> 27:30.759
Don't I need one of these?

27:30.759 --> 27:32.279
You and him are connected.

27:33.359 --> 27:35.000
He is here because you are here.

27:35.920 --> 27:37.960
When he goes, you go.

27:41.240 --> 27:42.480
Where are we going?

27:43.319 --> 27:44.480
Don't make me say it.

27:58.839 --> 28:00.039
Where are we going?

28:00.160 --> 28:01.319
Don't make me say it.

28:09.480 --> 28:10.759
Where are we going?

28:12.680 --> 28:14.240
It's about when are we going?

28:16.519 --> 28:19.440
So who is the grandfather
in this scenario?

28:19.799 --> 28:20.640
No one.

28:22.960 --> 28:24.160
The glass, I guess.

28:24.160 --> 28:25.039
Care to explain?

28:25.400 --> 28:28.200
The most popular
formulation for the paradox

28:28.759 --> 28:31.039
is what happens if you
travel back in time,

28:31.039 --> 28:33.400
far enough to kill your own grandfather

28:34.119 --> 28:35.680
before your father was born?

28:39.279 --> 28:40.599
You wouldn't go back in time.

28:40.599 --> 28:42.559
And no one would
kill your grandfather.

28:42.559 --> 28:43.920
Or somebody else would
kill your grandfather.

28:43.920 --> 28:45.400
Why would anybody else
kill your grandfather?

28:45.400 --> 28:47.039
I don't know, was he an asshole?

28:47.039 --> 28:47.880
You see?

28:48.599 --> 28:50.039
Too many variables.

28:51.039 --> 28:52.519
So we made it more simple.

28:53.720 --> 28:55.960
In the laboratory we used billard balls.

28:56.440 --> 28:58.000
But this is the same principle.

28:59.279 --> 29:02.680
What happens if you send
and object on a trajectory

29:04.039 --> 29:07.400
and then it travels back to
some point aof the said trajectory

29:09.000 --> 29:11.920
and interrupts itself from
going into the time machine?

29:12.759 --> 29:13.920
What happens then?

29:14.680 --> 29:16.640
You create a time paradox.

29:17.119 --> 29:18.200
A causal loop.

29:19.400 --> 29:21.359
A closed time-like curve.

29:21.359 --> 29:22.799
Whatever you want to call it.

29:23.559 --> 29:24.480
And then?

29:24.920 --> 29:26.200
Time fixes itself.

29:27.200 --> 29:28.880
So it never happened.

29:29.440 --> 29:31.039
Or it keeps happening forever

29:31.480 --> 29:32.559
inside the closed loop.

29:32.559 --> 29:33.400
We're not sure.

29:34.640 --> 29:38.359
Him arriving in my room was
the beginning of the loop?

29:38.440 --> 29:40.359
A beginning of a loop.

29:40.359 --> 29:41.200
How many are there?

29:41.200 --> 29:42.039
Quite a few.

29:42.440 --> 29:45.880
So what can I, we, do for you then?

29:45.960 --> 29:47.880
This whole thing got out of control.

29:48.519 --> 29:49.880
There are too many of them.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.599
All the loops need to be closed.

29:51.599 --> 29:52.440
Says who?

29:52.440 --> 29:54.440
The Soviet government, of course.

29:54.440 --> 29:57.039
How do I know you
are who you say you are?

29:57.720 --> 29:59.359
Your name is Tomas Mraz.

29:59.599 --> 30:02.240
You were born in 1962 in Prague.

30:02.519 --> 30:03.680
Raised by an uncle.

30:04.240 --> 30:07.200
Both parents immigrated right after 1968.

30:07.279 --> 30:08.160
You joined the army.

30:08.160 --> 30:10.440
Came to us as one of our
first human subjects.

30:10.440 --> 30:11.720
And who is us?

30:11.720 --> 30:12.559
Again,

30:12.599 --> 30:14.319
the Soviet government.

30:14.920 --> 30:16.400
So you are here to fix the world

30:16.400 --> 30:18.920
and return it to the glory of socialism.

30:21.440 --> 30:23.799
I don't think socialism is glorious.

30:26.279 --> 30:28.480
So you think this
world is so much better?

30:29.400 --> 30:30.720
I've seen the television.

30:31.519 --> 30:33.759
I've seen the chaos, the wars.

30:33.759 --> 30:35.039
As apposed to Cold War

30:35.039 --> 30:37.440
and "In The Event Of
Nuclear Winter" training?

30:37.519 --> 30:40.279
At least we had order, we had a purpose.

30:40.279 --> 30:42.079
You had orders to listen to.

30:42.200 --> 30:45.240
I am not here to pick sides.

30:45.240 --> 30:46.759
Why are you here then?

30:47.960 --> 30:49.200
The loops need closing.

30:50.200 --> 30:51.160
They're not safe.

30:52.400 --> 30:53.519
They keep collapsing.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.359
Time is trying to get back.

30:55.359 --> 30:56.319
Back where?

30:57.319 --> 30:58.240
At the beginning.

30:58.240 --> 30:59.079
Of time?

30:59.079 --> 31:00.319
Of the loop, I hope.

31:00.400 --> 31:01.279
You hope?

31:01.559 --> 31:03.559
The time could also be broken.

31:03.680 --> 31:05.759
You have been chasing the loops?

31:06.279 --> 31:09.079
I am making sure this
whole mess gets fixed.

31:09.440 --> 31:11.079
The journeys need to be tracked.

31:11.799 --> 31:14.680
I follow the signals the
localization device gives out

31:14.920 --> 31:16.160
when they are activated.

31:16.160 --> 31:18.640
Is that what got you here then?

31:18.640 --> 31:20.960
Is that what you have
hidden in your briefcase?

31:21.359 --> 31:22.440
It is here?

31:22.440 --> 31:23.279
Yes, it's...

31:23.279 --> 31:24.119
Shut up!

31:24.119 --> 31:25.440
Shut up or I will cut you.

31:25.440 --> 31:26.279
No you won't.

31:26.279 --> 31:27.519
I will cut you so slowly

31:27.519 --> 31:29.160
that you will bleed very painfully.

31:29.160 --> 31:30.359
What is your problem?

31:30.359 --> 31:32.039
She will fix this.

31:32.039 --> 31:32.880
Won't you?

31:34.279 --> 31:35.119
I will.

31:37.640 --> 31:41.000
You will go back, before
you traveled in time.

31:41.799 --> 31:42.799
Like the glass

31:44.039 --> 31:45.039
before it broke.

32:01.200 --> 32:02.599
Have you taken it apart?

32:03.079 --> 32:04.920
I was just about to do that.

32:04.920 --> 32:06.319
So what does it do?

32:06.319 --> 32:08.000
It takes you through time.

32:08.119 --> 32:09.480
Oh, thank you so much.

32:09.480 --> 32:11.119
Well, it was a stupid question.

32:12.559 --> 32:14.000
Actually it wasn't.

32:16.200 --> 32:19.799
This is a personal space
time localization device.

32:20.599 --> 32:22.480
It does take a person through time

32:23.240 --> 32:24.440
and space.

32:26.039 --> 32:27.920
For lack of a better description.

32:31.839 --> 32:35.519
What it actually does is
localize a certain individual

32:35.880 --> 32:38.279
in a different, previously selected time.

32:39.200 --> 32:40.559
So somebody selected this

32:40.559 --> 32:43.200
as the perfect day to send me visitors.

32:43.359 --> 32:44.160
Yes.

32:45.559 --> 32:47.039
And other times in your life.

32:47.359 --> 32:48.200
They should've let me know.

32:48.200 --> 32:49.319
I would've cleaned up.

32:50.799 --> 32:51.640
What?

32:51.720 --> 32:53.640
Well that doesn't seem
like something you would do.

32:53.640 --> 32:55.079
What're you trying to say?

32:55.079 --> 32:57.240
That you live like a pathetic pig.

32:57.240 --> 33:00.200
Do you no realize I
remember how you live?

33:00.279 --> 33:01.920
Well at least I can honestly say

33:01.920 --> 33:03.920
I never slept in my own piss.

33:03.920 --> 33:06.240
We don't have time for this.

33:09.039 --> 33:09.880
Fine.

33:12.720 --> 33:13.759
What were you saying?

33:15.920 --> 33:18.119
It is a localization device.

33:19.480 --> 33:22.240
It finds a person in a different time.

33:28.440 --> 33:30.079
These usually light it up.

33:31.759 --> 33:34.160
They are for selecting
the year you traveled to.

33:34.960 --> 33:37.640
You could move time
back a couple of seconds.

33:38.960 --> 33:40.720
This is a very old device.

33:42.119 --> 33:43.480
One of the first ones.

33:45.160 --> 33:47.759
Closest specification was
done by the main machine.

33:52.279 --> 33:54.240
Mine is a much newer device.

33:55.720 --> 33:58.559
In my, I guess you could call it,

33:59.000 --> 33:59.839
loop,

34:00.839 --> 34:02.440
we dealt with a lot of the bugs.

34:04.079 --> 34:05.920
Like the memory problem, for example.

34:06.160 --> 34:08.159
What was wrong with its memory?

34:08.159 --> 34:09.000
Not it.

34:10.079 --> 34:11.518
The people who traveled.

34:12.400 --> 34:14.880
They didn't remember
anything when they came back.

34:15.679 --> 34:16.480
Why is that?

34:18.000 --> 34:19.760
They came back from closed loops.

34:21.320 --> 34:22.920
We used to set the machines to come back

34:22.920 --> 34:25.518
at the exact time that
we sent them out from.

34:25.599 --> 34:26.480
Out where?

34:26.679 --> 34:27.518
We were experimenting

34:27.518 --> 34:29.280
with different times in the future.

34:29.679 --> 34:30.960
What about the past?

34:31.119 --> 34:33.400
This technology doesn't
let the traveler go back

34:33.400 --> 34:35.360
beyond the point of its invention.

34:35.960 --> 34:36.800
Which was?

34:38.480 --> 34:40.400
Sometime in 1986.

34:41.320 --> 34:42.719
I thought you invented it.

34:43.639 --> 34:44.480
No.

34:45.559 --> 34:47.079
I'm just assisting in a lab.

34:48.719 --> 34:50.000
I was, I guess.

34:52.800 --> 34:54.400
Now I go on quests.

34:54.800 --> 34:56.039
To close the loops.

34:57.679 --> 35:00.360
Traveling back in time to
prevent things happening?

35:01.280 --> 35:03.280
I follow other people's loops.

35:03.880 --> 35:06.119
I wouldn't be here if
I wasn't inside a loop.

35:06.880 --> 35:07.800
How do you know?

35:09.679 --> 35:10.760
There is two of you.

35:20.480 --> 35:23.639
And why is there only one of you?

35:27.599 --> 35:28.880
I follow other people

35:29.599 --> 35:31.199
because of how the device works.

35:33.280 --> 35:34.519
What do you mean?

35:36.079 --> 35:36.920
As I said,

35:37.960 --> 35:40.639
it takes you to the future.

35:40.639 --> 35:42.239
To a version of you at that time.

35:42.239 --> 35:43.079
So?

35:44.679 --> 35:46.280
There wasn't any version of me

35:47.079 --> 35:49.760
at anytime that would be
significant for the study.

35:54.119 --> 35:55.960
It means that I'm probably not alive.

35:59.280 --> 36:00.440
How long do you have?

36:03.199 --> 36:04.960
With the loops, it's hard to say.

36:07.760 --> 36:10.440
So you have to track
the steps of everyone

36:10.920 --> 36:13.039
who traveled back at any point.

36:14.159 --> 36:15.000
Not really.

36:16.840 --> 36:19.159
It's a little bit like
a tangled ball of yarn.

36:20.400 --> 36:21.639
You start pulling at one end

36:21.639 --> 36:23.840
and the loops start
figuring themselves out.

36:26.360 --> 36:28.280
There was a serious bundle around you.

36:30.920 --> 36:32.920
I'm finally getting to the center of it.

36:33.159 --> 36:34.079
How do you know?

36:36.000 --> 36:37.360
There is only two of you.

36:42.440 --> 36:45.760
Closing two loops would confuse
the device significantly.

36:48.239 --> 36:49.719
What time did you travel from?

36:53.440 --> 36:54.800
I have all the logs anyway.

36:55.800 --> 36:57.199
All I have to do it check.

36:57.679 --> 36:58.519
Don't worry.

37:00.639 --> 37:01.559
1987.

37:04.800 --> 37:06.480
You are definitely
the first version of you

37:06.480 --> 37:08.159
to travel successfully.

37:15.440 --> 37:16.960
This could've even been before

37:17.760 --> 37:19.719
we figured out how to close loops.

37:24.559 --> 37:25.800
I think it blew a fuse.

37:25.800 --> 37:26.639
Hmmm.

37:27.599 --> 37:29.440
That's what I thought.

37:30.239 --> 37:31.079
Sure.

37:32.519 --> 37:34.679
I know where to get a spare.

37:37.480 --> 37:38.480
I'm going alone.

37:39.679 --> 37:41.599
You two take care of the broken fuse.

38:08.480 --> 38:11.000
Are you going to do
whatever she tells you to do?

38:11.159 --> 38:12.639
She's from your precious government.

38:12.639 --> 38:15.239
I don't trust people just
because they say I should.

38:15.239 --> 38:16.719
That is news to me.

38:18.079 --> 38:20.159
What was your strategy before she appear?

38:20.440 --> 38:21.639
To take it apart.

38:23.320 --> 38:24.960
Do you know anything about it?

38:25.239 --> 38:27.480
Did they even tell you
what buttons to press?

38:27.920 --> 38:28.719
Well,

38:29.880 --> 38:31.480
it says here that this is a

38:33.599 --> 38:36.480
"personal localization device."

38:36.480 --> 38:40.760
We already know that.

38:40.760 --> 38:44.480
That should be the last screw.

39:13.840 --> 39:14.639
You hungry?

39:27.800 --> 39:28.639
Mmmm.

39:29.599 --> 39:30.440
Mmmm.

39:30.440 --> 39:31.320
This is really good.

39:32.079 --> 39:34.079
Pizza is always good.

39:35.159 --> 39:36.320
Interesting.

39:36.840 --> 39:38.920
And they deliver anytime?

39:39.679 --> 39:40.800
Most places do.

39:41.440 --> 39:42.280
Hmmm.

39:42.519 --> 39:43.480
How many are there?

39:43.480 --> 39:44.320
Quite a few.

39:45.440 --> 39:46.280
How do you choose?

39:46.280 --> 39:49.039
You go online, you check reviews.

39:49.599 --> 39:50.440
Go where?

40:03.719 --> 40:05.639
So there is tower bridge

40:06.119 --> 40:08.039
and it should be overhead now.

40:41.119 --> 40:42.039
Anything?

40:43.079 --> 40:43.960
Anything.

40:47.119 --> 40:47.960
Hmmm.

40:51.760 --> 40:54.360
How does it know all this stuff?

40:54.960 --> 40:56.079
People upload,

40:56.920 --> 40:58.159
put it on the internet

40:58.840 --> 41:00.320
and it checks through
the information it has

41:00.320 --> 41:02.039
on the topic you're interested in.

41:03.159 --> 41:05.800
But it's too complicated
for me to explain right now.

41:08.119 --> 41:08.960
You know, I don't think Alexandra's

41:08.960 --> 41:10.360
coming back anytime soon.

41:11.599 --> 41:13.719
Just show me how to turn it on.

41:15.039 --> 41:15.880
One last time.

41:30.400 --> 41:31.760
How did you turn that on?

41:32.079 --> 41:33.719
We have the same fingerprint.

41:34.159 --> 41:35.000
Did you sleep?

41:35.679 --> 41:36.519
A little.

41:38.440 --> 41:39.800
What did you find out?

41:40.559 --> 41:42.360
China is still communist.

41:43.039 --> 41:43.920
And North Korea...

41:43.920 --> 41:45.239
What about North Korea?

41:45.320 --> 41:47.679
They are the very definition
of a dictatorship.

41:47.679 --> 41:48.679
Still communist.

41:48.920 --> 41:51.239
Please, stop,
what are you reading?

41:51.239 --> 41:52.079
The internet.

41:52.440 --> 41:53.639
That could mean literally anything,

41:53.639 --> 41:55.400
including North Korean propaganda.

41:55.400 --> 41:57.679
I would know propaganda if I saw it.

41:57.679 --> 41:58.519
Ha!

41:59.320 --> 42:00.119
Firstly,

42:00.199 --> 42:01.880
most people would have difficulty knowing

42:01.880 --> 42:05.159
if they're dealing with their
grandmother or a mediocre bot.

42:05.199 --> 42:09.280
And secondly, literally
everything you know is propaganda.

42:09.320 --> 42:10.320
That is not true.

42:10.599 --> 42:11.760
I know things.

42:11.760 --> 42:12.599
Oh yeah?

42:12.840 --> 42:14.280
And where did you get this information?

42:14.280 --> 42:17.320
From your communist uncle,
your socialist school

42:17.320 --> 42:19.159
or your socialist youth club?

42:19.920 --> 42:21.519
When did you become so bitter?

42:21.760 --> 42:22.960
I'm not bitter.

42:23.159 --> 42:24.199
You're an idiot.

42:24.440 --> 42:26.079
I keep telling you they're lying to you.

42:26.079 --> 42:26.960
Who is?

42:27.119 --> 42:27.960
Everybody.

42:27.960 --> 42:30.440
Uncle, for a start, about
what happened with Mom.

42:30.639 --> 42:31.719
That doesn't matter.

42:31.760 --> 42:32.559
How can it not?

42:32.559 --> 42:34.400
Because it's not about me.

42:35.440 --> 42:36.480
It's about what is right.

42:36.480 --> 42:38.480
What the fuck would you know is right?

42:39.960 --> 42:40.800
Maybe I don't.

42:42.400 --> 42:43.960
But those in charge, they do.

42:45.360 --> 42:47.920
I may not understand how but
this is apart of a bigger plan

42:47.920 --> 42:49.639
and I am playing a role in it.

42:50.480 --> 42:52.119
There is no plan.

42:52.119 --> 42:54.480
They are power-hungry liars.

42:54.760 --> 42:57.360
So the world is so much
better without them, hmmm?

42:58.679 --> 42:59.960
No one can agree on anything.

42:59.960 --> 43:02.039
Well at least they're free to disagree.

43:02.159 --> 43:04.599
At least they don't go to prison
for singing the wrong song.

43:04.599 --> 43:06.119
Is that more important to people

43:06.119 --> 43:08.760
than having a home, having a job?

43:10.039 --> 43:11.320
It's all here.

43:12.199 --> 43:13.320
Instability,

43:13.760 --> 43:14.599
unemployment,

43:14.599 --> 43:15.559
depression.

43:15.719 --> 43:17.719
People weren't that
happy in the 80s either.

43:17.719 --> 43:18.679
Who wasn't happy?

43:18.679 --> 43:20.360
Well, for example, the
people who were beaten up

43:20.360 --> 43:21.920
and knocked up for going to a concert.

43:21.920 --> 43:23.480
Really, this?

43:24.280 --> 43:25.960
They weren't supposed to be there.

43:26.159 --> 43:27.960
They were just a bunch of propagators

43:27.960 --> 43:29.599
disguised as musicians.

43:29.840 --> 43:31.719
And those people tore down the regime

43:31.719 --> 43:33.400
you are putting all your trust in.

43:33.400 --> 43:34.280
I can save it.

43:34.280 --> 43:35.119
No you can't.

43:35.119 --> 43:36.679
I can tell them what to do.

43:36.760 --> 43:39.559
I am sure they already know.

43:54.920 --> 43:56.719
Took a little longer
than I would've liked.

43:56.719 --> 43:58.880
Do you care about what
happens in the world?

43:59.559 --> 44:00.880
- Excuse me?
- Answer me!

44:02.239 --> 44:03.199
Of course I care.

44:04.360 --> 44:05.360
That's why I'm here.

44:06.039 --> 44:08.000
So you are trying to save the regime?

44:09.199 --> 44:11.280
I don't think that's what's
going to happen in the end.

44:11.280 --> 44:12.840
So you're fine with destroying

44:12.840 --> 44:15.079
everything we built for 40 years?

44:17.840 --> 44:18.639
Which is it?

44:20.079 --> 44:21.320
I don't know.

44:23.639 --> 44:25.199
I'm sure it will have an impact

44:26.400 --> 44:28.119
but that's not why I'm doing this.

44:29.199 --> 44:31.760
I'm doing it because I'm
the only one who will do it.

44:33.480 --> 44:36.960
I don't know about social
reforms or economy.

44:38.519 --> 44:40.000
There are other people who do.

44:41.280 --> 44:42.559
I know about this.

44:42.920 --> 44:44.880
What if these other people are wrong?

44:46.239 --> 44:47.159
How do you know?

44:47.480 --> 44:48.559
He doesn't.

44:49.079 --> 44:50.320
And neither do you.

44:50.559 --> 44:51.440
I've seen it happen.

44:51.440 --> 44:53.000
I've seen it all fall apart.

44:53.280 --> 44:55.079
Maybe that's what needs to happen.

44:55.800 --> 44:56.599
I don't know.

44:57.599 --> 44:59.840
I don't know how to fix the world.

45:01.079 --> 45:02.639
But I know how to fix this.

45:03.559 --> 45:05.639
I thought you worked for the government.

45:07.800 --> 45:09.519
It's more complicated than that.

45:14.280 --> 45:16.639
Are you fucking crazy?

45:17.119 --> 45:17.960
So,

45:18.039 --> 45:18.920
you are a traitor.

45:20.960 --> 45:21.800
Where

45:22.719 --> 45:23.559
is

45:24.119 --> 45:24.960
The fuse?

45:48.719 --> 45:49.639
Is it done?

45:51.440 --> 45:52.360
It will work.

45:54.400 --> 45:57.760
Listen, this thing is
incredible easy to track.

45:58.400 --> 46:00.719
The second you turn it
on, someone will appear.

46:01.679 --> 46:02.599
What did you do?

46:03.079 --> 46:03.960
Turn it on!

46:04.119 --> 46:06.559
These men are from a
different version of this.

46:06.559 --> 46:07.480
They won't listen to you.

46:07.480 --> 46:09.119
I am not listening either.

46:09.119 --> 46:10.079
Turn it on!

46:18.519 --> 46:19.320
My name is...

46:22.840 --> 46:23.760
What did you do?

46:24.119 --> 46:24.960
Turn it!

46:29.119 --> 46:30.000
Destroy it!

46:30.079 --> 46:31.639
We're in the middle of a loop, I can't.

46:31.639 --> 46:32.599
But I saved you.

46:32.719 --> 46:35.320
And now you don't have a
reason to travel in time.

46:35.320 --> 46:37.239
You created a time paradox.

46:37.320 --> 46:38.159
Listen to me.

46:38.840 --> 46:40.800
You need to go to the beginning of this.

46:40.800 --> 46:42.199
Destroy all of it.

46:42.519 --> 46:44.920
A machine will take you
back there, any machine.

46:45.039 --> 46:46.519
I've been trying to
get you all back there

46:46.519 --> 46:47.800
but you need help.

46:48.599 --> 46:50.239
I am there but I won't trust you.

46:51.519 --> 46:52.440
What did you do?

46:52.599 --> 46:53.440
Turn it on!

46:53.760 --> 46:55.960
These men are from a
different version of this.

46:55.960 --> 46:56.800
They don't listen...

46:56.800 --> 46:57.920
I am not listening either!

46:57.920 --> 46:58.840
Turn it on!

47:01.840 --> 47:05.039
My name is...

47:05.559 --> 47:16.079
Alexandra, did you think
that you could hide forever?

47:17.320 --> 47:20.480
She made a faster tracker for you.

47:20.880 --> 47:29.679
She does what I say lately.

47:29.679 --> 47:32.760
You haven't been there.

47:33.719 --> 47:37.039
They might even have
been the last ones.

47:39.840 --> 47:41.119
Are you sure?

47:42.000 --> 47:43.519
You will never know.

47:45.239 --> 47:46.679
Will you come with me?

47:48.159 --> 47:50.360
Or do I have to shoot you again?

48:03.159 --> 48:04.400
I told you she was a traitor!

48:04.400 --> 48:06.400
Are you fucking crazy?!

48:06.559 --> 48:08.679
I didn't trust her
and the General said...

48:08.679 --> 48:09.519
You know him?

48:09.559 --> 48:10.480
Of course I do!

48:10.639 --> 48:11.639
He's very high up

48:11.639 --> 48:13.320
and now he thinks I work for her.

48:13.480 --> 48:15.360
This will take me back, back before...

48:31.760 --> 48:33.719
Welcome.

48:34.280 --> 48:37.159
Welcome, Comrade Mraz.

48:37.920 --> 48:38.920
Oh, great.

48:40.280 --> 48:41.199
Where am I?

48:44.679 --> 48:47.880
You know what, let's start
with, what year is it?

48:48.599 --> 48:49.880
1987.

48:52.159 --> 48:53.639
Ukraine, Mr. Mraz.

48:55.360 --> 48:59.800
In very secret facility
owned by U.S.S.R. government.

49:01.280 --> 49:02.760
Tell me, Mr. Mraz,

49:03.239 --> 49:05.079
what brings you to us?

49:05.480 --> 49:08.199
I didn't exactly have a choice.

49:09.480 --> 49:12.280
What do you
know about our facility?

49:15.039 --> 49:19.000
I have no idea where this place is.

49:22.280 --> 49:27.280
I think I'm going
to leave you to our...

49:49.239 --> 49:51.440
Is he going to hurt him?

49:51.599 --> 49:52.960
Of course not.

49:53.159 --> 49:55.360
This is a scientific breakthrough.

50:03.840 --> 50:07.039
They are gorgeous, aren't they?

50:07.599 --> 50:08.639
How many people have you sent?

50:08.639 --> 50:09.559
A couple.

50:09.960 --> 50:13.559
Most of them don't remember anything.

50:14.639 --> 50:16.159
Closed loops.

50:16.440 --> 50:18.239
How do you know?

50:24.800 --> 50:26.079
There was a woman.

50:26.360 --> 50:29.119
She found me in his apartment.

50:33.559 --> 50:35.400
What are you going
to do with him?

50:36.440 --> 50:39.239
We are just talking to him.

50:53.719 --> 50:55.880
What are you doing here?

50:56.639 --> 50:57.480
Do we know...

50:57.480 --> 50:59.639
Don't play games with me.

50:59.880 --> 51:01.480
I know exactly who you are.

51:07.519 --> 51:09.599
- Stop following me.
- Who do you work for?

51:10.559 --> 51:11.519
The Americans?

51:14.159 --> 51:15.440
Do you know who I am?

51:17.559 --> 51:19.599
You just came from future.

51:23.320 --> 51:25.880
Do you know me from the future?

51:25.920 --> 51:26.960
You don't remember.

51:29.199 --> 51:30.199
Think about it.

51:37.679 --> 51:39.440
You probably haven't done it yet.

51:42.559 --> 51:43.480
But he came.

51:44.920 --> 51:47.679
Called you a traitor and took you away.

51:48.679 --> 51:49.679
Alexandra?

51:55.199 --> 51:58.199
Professor, we checked all
the devices that we sent out.

51:58.920 --> 52:01.400
I believe they are all back.

52:01.840 --> 52:03.400
That's great news.

52:03.800 --> 52:07.960
I believe that some of them
had location problems.

52:07.960 --> 52:10.360
That's enough Alexandra.

52:10.519 --> 52:13.840
No need to give out state secrets.

52:26.599 --> 52:30.840
Just answer simple question
and you will go free.

52:31.360 --> 52:34.920
I have no idea what
you're talking about!

52:36.119 --> 52:38.159
What is your plan?

52:38.440 --> 52:40.800
I'm tied to a table!

52:40.800 --> 52:44.920
Even if I had a plan, it's
clearly not working out.

52:44.920 --> 52:48.119
The young one appeared out of nowhere

52:48.519 --> 52:52.079
talking about saving the world.

52:54.559 --> 52:56.599
Is he accusing me?

52:57.199 --> 53:00.400
It's just an interrogation technique.

53:01.760 --> 53:05.440
You have no
idea how you got here?

53:07.760 --> 53:10.239
For the billionth time,

53:11.320 --> 53:12.159
I have never done

53:14.000 --> 53:15.559
anything like this.

53:23.880 --> 53:28.159
Are you 100 percent sure, Mr. Mraz?

53:31.599 --> 53:35.119
Maybe you just remember
going to our facility.

53:36.159 --> 53:38.000
Fuck you, bitch!

53:39.199 --> 53:40.400
Professor Andreeva.

53:45.480 --> 53:47.559
Your wife, right?

53:47.559 --> 53:48.639
My brother.

53:49.400 --> 53:50.480
You would've been treated

53:50.480 --> 53:53.719
significantly differently, Mr. Mraz,

53:54.679 --> 53:58.840
if you could have given us
some relevant information.

53:59.079 --> 54:03.760
Professor, I have no
memory of this place.

54:04.719 --> 54:06.079
Are you sure?

54:07.000 --> 54:07.840
Why is it so important?

54:09.280 --> 54:13.119
We need to establish size of your loop.

54:13.480 --> 54:15.800
How do you even know we are in a loop?

54:16.559 --> 54:19.880
There are two of you here.

54:22.320 --> 54:24.480
Is he in there with you?

54:24.639 --> 54:27.440
You really fucked up this time!

54:29.960 --> 54:32.519
How do you even know
you can close this loop?

54:32.559 --> 54:36.599
I have done extensive experiments.

54:38.079 --> 54:41.320
We have spent months
throwing a billard ball

54:41.320 --> 54:43.039
down from stairs

54:43.480 --> 54:48.480
and making everyone very
confused about when lunch is.

54:48.960 --> 54:51.440
Having you here, however,

54:52.039 --> 54:54.480
is something completely different.

55:07.840 --> 55:09.360
Professor!

55:13.039 --> 55:13.880
Yes?

55:14.599 --> 55:17.679
Does that mean there's
only one version of history?

55:18.360 --> 55:19.840
That would be my bet.

55:20.280 --> 55:21.800
Did you hear that?

55:21.800 --> 55:24.920
Well now that
you are eager to speak.

55:32.519 --> 55:33.960
What's wrong?

55:34.079 --> 55:36.639
Didn't you hear him?

55:36.719 --> 55:39.480
There is only one
version of history.

55:40.159 --> 55:42.320
I told you everything.

55:42.880 --> 55:44.519
There is no USSR!

55:45.480 --> 55:46.920
Of course.

55:47.599 --> 55:49.719
Have you read a newspaper lately?

55:50.880 --> 55:52.519
What do you mean?

55:53.800 --> 55:57.119
That we would have to
go further into the past.

55:57.360 --> 56:01.320
To be able to stop that.

56:01.559 --> 56:03.960
And are you trying to do that?

56:04.360 --> 56:06.360
Did you inform Moscow?

56:06.679 --> 56:08.679
If we tell them what you told us,

56:09.119 --> 56:13.239
they will try to change the future.

56:13.960 --> 56:16.320
They would create a paradox.

56:17.679 --> 56:19.000
Exactly!

56:24.159 --> 56:26.119
But what can we do?

56:28.039 --> 56:30.840
Continue in our experiments.

56:32.559 --> 56:35.639
I thought you
weren't supposed to hurt me.

56:35.639 --> 56:38.039
I do what I want.

56:38.079 --> 56:40.280
That's not what it
looked like a second ago.

56:40.280 --> 56:41.519
Is your sister coming back?

56:41.519 --> 56:44.360
I think this situation
needs someone with a...

56:46.639 --> 56:49.920
When did U.S.S.R. fall apart?

56:51.840 --> 56:54.039
I'm sure he
told you all about that.

56:54.800 --> 56:56.840
I want to hear it from you.

56:59.920 --> 57:02.440
1991, officially.

57:03.639 --> 57:04.480
Officially?

57:06.559 --> 57:08.800
When did the process start?

57:10.159 --> 57:11.280
Let's see.

57:11.280 --> 57:14.239
When the paranoid lunatic
in charge of the country

57:14.400 --> 57:19.039
decided to go into a decade
long nuclear Mexican standoff!

57:19.360 --> 57:20.960
Of course.

57:21.440 --> 57:25.039
But the other side wasn't affected at all?

57:25.960 --> 57:28.679
I don't fucking know why
communism doesn't work.

57:31.440 --> 57:34.679
What about China, Mr. Mraz?

57:36.280 --> 57:38.280
Did he tell you to ask that?

57:38.280 --> 57:40.960
Answer the question.

57:41.159 --> 57:42.280
Fine.

57:42.719 --> 57:43.559
Fine.

57:45.440 --> 57:48.039
You said 1987, right?

57:49.280 --> 57:52.159
I'm sure China de-ollectivized by now.

57:54.039 --> 57:55.920
They did.

57:56.320 --> 57:57.280
Well it's more of the same.

57:57.280 --> 58:00.119
Opening up the markets and so on.

58:00.880 --> 58:02.440
They decided they only needed

58:02.440 --> 58:06.360
the human rights violating
parts of socialism.

58:06.719 --> 58:10.119
But the party is in control.

58:10.440 --> 58:11.400
Yes it is.

58:17.719 --> 58:19.639
Are you looking for somewhere to hide?

58:25.599 --> 58:29.000
Professor, wouldn't that
cause a paradox too?

58:30.400 --> 58:33.519
I do no know
what you are talking about.

58:33.519 --> 58:35.800
If you transferred your
operation somewhere else

58:35.800 --> 58:38.280
based on what I will tell you.

58:38.280 --> 58:41.239
We don't
need to transfer anywhere.

58:42.199 --> 58:44.559
This is top secret facility.

58:45.599 --> 58:48.920
No one knows what we are doing here.

58:49.039 --> 58:50.880
Katerina!

58:51.199 --> 58:57.760
Would you not
disclose secret information

58:58.480 --> 59:03.000
to the enemy of the state.

59:03.679 --> 59:05.480
Moscow doesn't know.

59:10.760 --> 59:13.000
Who's the General Secretary now?

59:15.000 --> 59:15.960
Be quiet.

59:22.840 --> 59:23.960
What?

59:24.840 --> 59:26.199
It's Gorbachev.

59:28.920 --> 59:30.559
Barely a year.

59:31.280 --> 59:33.679
He is third in past five years.

59:37.000 --> 59:41.320
I don't remember ever sending
anything to Moscow.

59:41.920 --> 59:44.199
They don't know.

59:44.599 --> 59:46.119
They don't need to know.

59:46.880 --> 59:51.320
We will tell them when
we solve all the bugs.

01:00:06.519 --> 01:00:09.239
So what is your plan, get rich?

01:00:10.599 --> 01:00:13.400
Did you find out what
happens to the two of you?

01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:17.719
Do you know what happens to you?

01:00:17.719 --> 01:00:21.280
I thought I was am
important test subject.

01:00:23.039 --> 01:00:25.000
If you won't talk to us,

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:29.039
then we will have to find
some other way to test you.

01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:31.920
Do you think you can just kill me?

01:00:32.599 --> 01:00:33.639
Why not?

01:00:34.239 --> 01:00:37.679
Are you sure it will not
create another paradox?

01:00:39.159 --> 01:00:41.800
Maybe we need to see what happens.

01:00:46.719 --> 01:00:47.880
Put this on.

01:00:49.159 --> 01:00:50.440
What is this.

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:52.880
It will take you further back.

01:00:53.559 --> 01:00:55.320
He can't hurt him if
there is an older version

01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:56.519
of him in the loop.

01:00:56.559 --> 01:00:57.480
And then?

01:00:58.480 --> 01:00:59.320
Come back.

01:01:00.599 --> 01:01:02.480
Find me and tell me.

01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:17.119
You see, Mr Mraz?

01:01:18.159 --> 01:01:20.840
For us, it does not matter.

01:01:22.039 --> 01:01:24.239
Loop will just reset.

01:01:25.519 --> 01:01:27.280
We might not even remember this.

01:01:29.679 --> 01:01:33.639
But for you, this might be it.

01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:35.880
The end.

01:01:37.519 --> 01:01:42.239
Are you sure there is
nothing else you can tell us?

01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:44.800
Like what?

01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:47.320
Like that you lied to us.

01:01:47.559 --> 01:01:49.559
Maybe you are a spy.

01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:51.119
What?

01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:53.960
Are you a spy?

01:01:54.119 --> 01:01:56.000
No.

01:02:05.599 --> 01:02:06.800
I am here, reporting for duty!

01:02:38.079 --> 01:02:39.000
Oh, fuck.

01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:10.719
You have not thought this
screaming thing through at all,

01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:11.599
have you?

01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:22.400
Do you even remember me?

01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:26.960
I wouldn't say you do.

01:03:27.639 --> 01:03:31.079
That entrance was spectacularly stupid.

01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:38.239
Are you from 1987?

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:43.880
January?

01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:52.960
I have a lot to tell you.

01:04:32.119 --> 01:04:33.079
So that's it.

01:04:33.679 --> 01:04:36.400
I guess I don't understand
what I'm supposed to do.

01:04:50.559 --> 01:04:51.400
What?

01:04:53.119 --> 01:04:54.679
Oh, you're thirsty?

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:55.840
Mhmm.

01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:02.199
Mhmm.

01:05:11.119 --> 01:05:12.679
You must be joking.

01:05:19.199 --> 01:05:21.800
Cut the shit, I'm very thirsty.

01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:35.800
Ow!

01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:01.800
Well?

01:06:03.719 --> 01:06:04.960
It seems very clear.

01:06:07.159 --> 01:06:10.639
You have to destroy it
all as Alexandra said.

01:06:11.119 --> 01:06:13.800
But what about defending socialism?

01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:16.960
How does breaking
time protect socialism?

01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:24.320
So this is how I'll live.

01:06:25.599 --> 01:06:26.599
Maybe not.

01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:28.280
Maybe they will break time.

01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:30.119
Why do you live alone?

01:06:31.559 --> 01:06:32.400
I mean,

01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:36.440
why do we live alone?

01:06:41.679 --> 01:06:43.159
My wife left

01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:45.760
two months ago.

01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:48.800
Took everything.

01:06:54.079 --> 01:06:56.039
I signed the divorce papers yesterday.

01:06:58.880 --> 01:06:59.679
What happened?

01:07:01.559 --> 01:07:02.880
She said she wanted to leave.

01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:03.800
I didn't stop her.

01:07:07.119 --> 01:07:07.960
Well,

01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:10.440
maybe it wasn't meant to be.

01:07:13.199 --> 01:07:14.000
Maybe.

01:07:15.559 --> 01:07:17.119
And you said we're in London.

01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:20.320
Well father died and left me everything.

01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:22.119
I'd seen no reason not to go.

01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:27.840
Oh, don't be angry with him.

01:07:28.599 --> 01:07:30.400
When Mom died it was hard for him.

01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:33.599
By the time he got everything sorted out,

01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:37.960
you, I wouldn't speak to him.

01:07:38.159 --> 01:07:39.039
But Uncle said that...

01:07:39.039 --> 01:07:41.119
That's what they told him.

01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:43.159
They were trying to arrest him.

01:07:43.159 --> 01:07:44.599
They were making up evidence.

01:07:45.159 --> 01:07:46.159
Do you have proof?

01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:47.639
Maybe we could go...

01:07:47.639 --> 01:07:49.679
No, I don't think we get redoes.

01:07:49.679 --> 01:07:51.079
I think this is it.

01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:55.800
There's still the two of us.

01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:01.519
1986, right?

01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:04.840
She said go back to the beginning.

01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:06.280
Well it ends in 1986.

01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:07.960
It only does years.

01:08:08.239 --> 01:08:09.079
I know.

01:08:09.519 --> 01:08:12.480
Closest specification was
usually done by the main machine.

01:08:14.119 --> 01:08:15.519
So?

01:08:16.158 --> 01:08:17.760
Just press the button.

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:25.439
Where are we?

01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:28.840
Where do you think you are?

01:08:30.198 --> 01:08:32.399
Or rather, when are we, right?

01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:34.960
Is that supposed to be joke?

01:08:36.198 --> 01:08:38.560
I not laugh.

01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:46.560
Are you even capable of that?

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.920
How did you get here?

01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:53.600
You have our briefcase,
you know how we got here.

01:08:54.198 --> 01:08:57.560
Are Americans so far
ahead with technology?

01:08:57.560 --> 01:09:01.279
Are you American spies?

01:09:01.279 --> 01:09:02.560
This is your technology.

01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:03.800
You have to go back.

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:05.840
Are you crazy?

01:09:06.038 --> 01:09:10.560
Listen, in case they are spies.

01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:13.279
This works every time.

01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:18.359
If nothing else, this is probably
a younger version of that one.

01:09:19.038 --> 01:09:25.000
That is exactly the example I told
you about the time paradox.

01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:28.680
But he isn't going to kill himself.

01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:31.920
That doesn't matter.

01:09:32.238 --> 01:09:34.439
If you kill the first one.

01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:38.359
The second one couldn't have existed.

01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:40.118
Do you have a different
father or something?

01:09:40.118 --> 01:09:41.880
Why doesn't he understand this?

01:09:43.158 --> 01:09:44.880
How do you like dying?

01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:47.158
You already tried that.

01:09:47.359 --> 01:09:48.560
What do you mean?

01:09:49.359 --> 01:09:50.640
It's a long story.

01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:52.840
They're just stalling.

01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:55.359
We must kill them.

01:09:56.920 --> 01:09:59.760
No time paradoxes!

01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:02.439
So he just doesn't listen.

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:08.119
I will ram my fist down your throat.

01:10:13.039 --> 01:10:16.279
Professor, you need to come
to the lab immediately!

01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:19.239
I don't have time for this.

01:10:19.399 --> 01:10:22.640
It's code 609 again.

01:10:27.439 --> 01:10:30.680
Try not to kill them.

01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:39.600
Code 609, what do...

01:10:40.159 --> 01:10:41.000
Again.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.119
Do you think somebody else is here?

01:10:42.119 --> 01:10:43.840
You said more people traveled.

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:44.960
Maybe someone's here to help us.

01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:46.560
Who, them?

01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:48.359
There's still just the two of us.

01:10:48.359 --> 01:10:49.720
It's unfinished.

01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:51.960
You're starting to bore me.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:54.680
She said not to kill us.

01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:57.039
She said to try.

01:10:57.239 --> 01:10:59.279
He can't hurt us, it'll
just start another loop.

01:10:59.279 --> 01:11:00.479
Or maybe they'll just keep sending us

01:11:00.479 --> 01:11:02.159
to the beginning again forever.

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:05.199
Now that sounds interesting.

01:11:05.199 --> 01:11:06.359
Don't give him ideas.

01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:11.039
You need to go to the laboratory!

01:11:38.279 --> 01:11:40.960
Try to bring yourself a little closer.

01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:42.000
Oh this is useless.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.239
Can you see anything sharp?

01:11:43.239 --> 01:11:44.079
What good will it do?

01:11:44.079 --> 01:11:45.039
We've gotta stop them.

01:11:45.039 --> 01:11:45.880
We don't know how to stop them.

01:11:46.319 --> 01:11:49.479
We'll figure something.

01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:07.000
Who is there?

01:12:09.399 --> 01:12:10.880
What're you doing?

01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:14.279
Making sure
this whole messed gets fixed

01:12:15.479 --> 01:12:18.960
and that the bastard
gets what he deserves.

01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:19.960
Alexandra?

01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:21.920
Do you remember?

01:12:23.039 --> 01:12:24.640
He told me who you are

01:12:26.279 --> 01:12:27.600
and what he did.

01:12:31.239 --> 01:12:33.159
You shot the General?

01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:36.119
I know I shouldn't have.

01:12:36.119 --> 01:12:38.359
But that's how I found out.

01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:41.720
That's what he told me.

01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:43.600
Who?

01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:48.199
The third one.

01:12:50.119 --> 01:12:52.199
He told you to save us.

01:12:53.479 --> 01:12:55.039
Not exactly save.

01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:07.479
But wait.

01:13:08.359 --> 01:13:10.439
What're we waiting for?

01:13:11.239 --> 01:13:12.640
To see if it works.

01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:13.840
Is it going to?

01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:17.640
Are they really going to change history?

01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:18.560
No.

01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:22.359
I lied to them.

01:13:22.359 --> 01:13:24.039
He is lying to them right now.

01:13:32.119 --> 01:13:33.159
I guess it's working.

01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:36.039
What is working?

01:13:37.079 --> 01:13:38.239
You don't know?

01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:40.119
What?

01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:41.800
He knew.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.520
He knew what needed to happen.

01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:48.640
I had to explain to him the physics.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.520
You trusted him.

01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:54.359
He knew too much about me.

01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:58.039
He knew exactly what to say.

01:14:01.199 --> 01:14:02.039
Like a password.

01:14:05.239 --> 01:14:07.159
I guess if he was at the end of a loop.

01:14:13.479 --> 01:14:14.600
They found the body.

01:14:21.079 --> 01:14:22.079
It doesn't matter.

01:14:24.039 --> 01:14:26.199
They won't have enough
time to do anything.

01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:28.840
It's almost done.

01:14:32.479 --> 01:14:33.680
What is happening?

01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:37.279
She knows it all has to go.

01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:40.079
They've done our job for us.

01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:44.680
It was the only way.

01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:46.000
The only way to what?

01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:48.279
Close all the loops.

01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:52.399
Some of the others showed
up saying the same thing.

01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:53.880
So is it the end then?

01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:56.000
I think so, yes.

01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:01.239
There is no one outside of this place

01:15:01.239 --> 01:15:02.880
that knows what's happening here.

01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:06.399
All the research will be lost.

01:15:09.439 --> 01:15:11.319
It will take decades to replace it.

01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:15.279
You don't have to carry that much.

01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:17.640
You're not here.

01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:19.680
Well,

01:15:20.319 --> 01:15:22.520
another version of you isn't here.

01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:23.359
What?

01:15:24.399 --> 01:15:26.319
It's April 1986.

01:15:29.039 --> 01:15:31.039
But I didn't get here until next year.

01:15:31.439 --> 01:15:32.840
There is a version of you,

01:15:34.359 --> 01:15:35.560
somewhere out there,

01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:38.640
sleeping comfortably in his bed.

01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:40.600
But you're here.

01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:42.960
What happens to you?

01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:46.399
I'm just going to wait here.

01:15:48.079 --> 01:15:49.640
We can't let you do this.

01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:50.680
It's not fair.

01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:52.000
Are you crazy?

01:15:52.199 --> 01:15:53.039
We're at the end of all this.

01:15:53.039 --> 01:15:54.920
There must be some other way.

01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:57.279
There isn't, she would've thought of it.

01:15:57.279 --> 01:15:59.199
She had plenty of time.

01:15:59.359 --> 01:16:01.439
I had about 20 minutes.

01:16:02.199 --> 01:16:03.439
Not you, you.

01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:04.760
The other you.

01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:08.399
So we are just going
to let everybody die?

01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:11.880
Should at least warn someone.

01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:13.520
I don't think there is time.

01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:18.159
I told them to run the
reactors on full power.

01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:19.520
Reactors?

01:16:20.239 --> 01:16:21.720
On full power, yes.

01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:26.279
This power plant wasn't
built to withstand that.

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:34.000
We're in the Ukraine, right?

01:16:36.399 --> 01:16:37.239
April.

01:16:39.199 --> 01:16:40.039
25th.

01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:53.920
Are we in Chernobyl?

01:16:55.720 --> 01:16:56.680
How did you know?

01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:33.560
Tomas?

01:19:55.680 --> 01:19:57.680
Which year are you from?

01:20:08.119 --> 01:20:09.680
Give me that thing.

01:20:24.399 --> 01:20:28.319
She said we need to go back to find her.

01:20:30.119 --> 01:20:31.560
She definitely did.

01:20:34.119 --> 01:20:36.520
She said that to all of you.

01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:41.199
But there's no point going back

01:20:42.039 --> 01:20:43.640
if you don't know the password.

01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:52.239
Do you know what to tell her?

01:20:57.960 --> 01:21:01.119
You had better hide when we get there.

01:21:02.840 --> 01:21:04.119
There would recognize you.

01:21:06.479 --> 01:21:07.359
Is it over then?

01:21:09.399 --> 01:21:11.000
It'll be like it never happened.

01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:17.560
Or it will keep happening
in a loop forever.

01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:30.720
What is the password?

01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:36.399
She said to say.

01:21:37.305 --> 01:21:43.229
