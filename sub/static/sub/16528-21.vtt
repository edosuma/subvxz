00:00.668 --> 00:01.500
ADULT ADAM:
<i> Growing up in the '80s,</i>

00:01.502 --> 00:04.670
<i> some of my best memories</i>
<i> were with my big sister,</i>
<i> Erica.</i>

00:04.672 --> 00:06.138
<i> She was always there for me</i>

00:06.140 --> 00:08.974
<i> and entertained</i>
<i> even my silliest of ideas.</i>

00:08.976 --> 00:10.509
<i> My big brother,</i>
<i> on the other hand,</i>

00:10.511 --> 00:13.979
<i> was most entertained</i>
<i> by smacking me around</i>
<i> like a rag doll.</i>

00:13.981 --> 00:15.781
Barry, put me down!
Nope.

00:15.783 --> 00:16.515
Don't jostle him too much.

00:16.517 --> 00:19.685
I am not paying to have
the carpet shampooed again.

00:19.687 --> 00:20.019
Mom, help!

00:20.021 --> 00:21.854
ADULT ADAM:
<i> Like most brothers,</i>
<i> when we got together,</i>

00:21.856 --> 00:24.490
<i> we didn't always make</i>
<i> the brightest of decisions.</i>

00:24.492 --> 00:25.824
What are
you two dopes doing?

00:25.826 --> 00:27.259
Deciding which college
we should go to.

00:27.261 --> 00:30.996
We taped 18 hours' worth
of<i> USA Up All Night</i> movies

00:30.998 --> 00:32.331
and carefully
studied them all.

00:32.333 --> 00:33.866
Got to tell you,
it's a tough choice.

00:33.868 --> 00:35.267
It's between
<i> Screwball Academy...</i>

00:35.269 --> 00:37.236
Which is ranked first
in coed pillow fighting.

00:37.238 --> 00:40.105
...Or the unnamed school
from<i> Sorority House Party,</i>

00:40.107 --> 00:42.408
which has a great
wet t-shirt program.

00:42.410 --> 00:43.375
None of it's real!

00:43.377 --> 00:46.245
<i> Bikini Ski School</i>
Isn't real.

00:46.247 --> 00:47.546
You sound like
the stuffy dean

00:47.548 --> 00:48.947
who lost the mountain
in a ski race.

00:48.949 --> 00:51.817
ADULT ADAM:<i> Oddly enough,</i>
<i> it seemed like</i>
<i> the older we got,</i>

00:51.819 --> 00:53.018
<i> the stupider</i>
<i> the ideas became.</i>

00:53.020 --> 00:56.822
Whatcha doing?
Dude, look how awesome
I am at this balloon.

00:56.824 --> 00:57.589
Eh, I've seen better.

00:57.591 --> 01:01.760
Better? Let's see<i> you</i>
handle the heat!

01:02.530 --> 01:05.097
Ha! I'm so much better
at the balloon than you.

01:05.099 --> 01:07.733
Fine! First one
to let it hit the ground

01:07.735 --> 01:09.802
gets their nurples purpled.

01:09.804 --> 01:10.769
Game on, loser.

01:10.771 --> 01:14.473
I'm coming at you
with everything I've got.

01:17.278 --> 01:19.812
955. 956. 957.

01:19.814 --> 01:20.979
I love how close they are.

01:20.981 --> 01:24.416
Don't encourage
these morons.
You're aggravating me.

01:24.418 --> 01:26.251
Stop it.
Stop hitting the balloon!

01:26.253 --> 01:28.353
Murray, let me put some
salad on your plate.

01:28.355 --> 01:30.756
This is the worst dinner
of my life.

01:30.758 --> 01:32.224
Oh! Still in play!

01:32.226 --> 01:34.793
Please give up.
I can't feel my arms.

01:34.795 --> 01:35.427
Just let it
hit the ground.

01:35.429 --> 01:38.664
<i> You</i> let it hit the ground.
I have a Spanish test
in the morning

01:38.666 --> 01:39.965
I'm gonna fail
'cause of you.

01:39.967 --> 01:41.133
Someone let it
hit the ground

01:41.135 --> 01:43.335
and end this<i> ferkakte</i>
game already.

01:43.337 --> 01:44.169
We're too far in, Pops.

01:44.171 --> 01:45.904
There's no going back.
He's right.

01:45.906 --> 01:47.106
We're in too deep!

01:47.108 --> 01:48.307
It's just a balloon.

01:48.309 --> 01:50.709
Not anymore!
This is our life now.

01:50.711 --> 01:52.811
You'll all come to accept it
in due time.

01:52.813 --> 01:53.712
Okay, enough of this
stupidity!

01:53.714 --> 01:57.382
ADULT ADAM:<i> Fortunately,</i>
<i> for every dumb idea</i>
<i> my brother roped me into,</i>

01:57.384 --> 02:00.352
<i> there was always my sister</i>
<i> to bail me out.</i>

02:00.354 --> 02:02.588
There. It's over.
It's a tie.

02:02.590 --> 02:03.989
Go back to your
meaningless lives.

02:03.991 --> 02:07.359
I'm free!
Thank you for saving us
from ourselves.

02:09.797 --> 02:10.796
Let go.

02:10.798 --> 02:12.264
You let go first.
Never.

02:12.266 --> 02:14.099
(BOTH GRUNTING)
Is this another game?

02:14.101 --> 02:17.669
I don't understand
a thing you two do.

02:17.838 --> 02:19.204
<i> ¶ I'm twisted up inside</i>

02:19.206 --> 02:23.375
<i> ¶ But nonetheless</i>
<i> I feel the need to say</i>

02:25.713 --> 02:26.678
<i> ¶ I don't know the future</i>

02:26.680 --> 02:30.749
<i> ¶ But the past keeps getting</i>
<i> clearer every day ¶</i>

02:30.751 --> 02:33.552
ADULT ADAM:<i> It was April 26,</i>
<i> 1980-something...</i>

02:33.554 --> 02:34.987
<i> The day my dad</i>
<i> was honored</i>

02:34.989 --> 02:36.922
<i> as one of Jenkintown's</i>
<i> top businessmen.</i>

02:36.924 --> 02:38.991
<i> His speech was one</i>
<i> that said little</i>

02:38.993 --> 02:40.726
<i> while meaning even less.</i>

02:40.728 --> 02:43.162
I can't remember
that customer's name.

02:43.164 --> 02:44.563
Um...

02:44.565 --> 02:46.365
Well...

02:46.600 --> 02:47.799
No.

02:47.801 --> 02:48.567
Point being is,

02:48.569 --> 02:52.137
that's why you always sell
end tables separately.

02:52.139 --> 02:56.642
Well, thank you so much
for the award and for lunch.

02:56.644 --> 02:58.610
It was... yeah.

02:59.146 --> 03:00.846
(LAUGHS)

03:01.549 --> 03:03.448
All right, let's go.
I want to beat traffic.

03:03.450 --> 03:05.551
Oh. That was such
a great speech, Mur.

03:05.553 --> 03:06.752
I am so proud of you.

03:06.754 --> 03:08.287
Tell him how proud
you are, kids.

03:08.289 --> 03:09.288
Good stuff.
You really did it.

03:09.290 --> 03:11.290
Your job kind of sucks.
Ooh! Look!

03:11.292 --> 03:12.491
They're hanging
your plaque, Mur.

03:12.493 --> 03:15.594
I'm literally kvelling
out of every pore of my body.

03:15.596 --> 03:17.863
Look at all the amazing people
you're with.

03:17.865 --> 03:21.166
Yeah, I didn't know Martin
from Martin's Aquarium
did all this stuff.

03:21.168 --> 03:23.001
He plays jazz,
sailed around the world.

03:23.003 --> 03:24.903
Yeah, and that guy
from Vantresca's Tuxedo

03:24.905 --> 03:27.372
climbs mountains
and volunteers at the zoo.

03:27.374 --> 03:29.041
Here it is, Mur... Behold!

03:29.043 --> 03:33.512
BARRY: "Hobbies. Watching
the weather channel
and 'getting comfortable.'"

03:33.514 --> 03:34.413
Hmm. He nailed it.

03:34.415 --> 03:35.581
This is all you wrote, Murray?

03:35.583 --> 03:37.249
What? I only had a month
to think of stuff.

03:37.251 --> 03:39.117
Well, I'd say that's
a very accurate description

03:39.119 --> 03:40.552
of his lifestyle.
Not at all!

03:40.554 --> 03:43.956
Your father has many wonderful
interests and hobbies.

03:43.958 --> 03:45.190
I do?
He does?

03:45.192 --> 03:48.193
Of course. I mean...

03:48.195 --> 03:50.862
Well, for starters,
there's...

03:51.565 --> 03:53.398
I got one.
He loves to call us morons.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.801
I thought of that,
but that's not a hobby per se.

03:55.803 --> 03:57.603
Stop it.
He likes replacing batteries.

03:57.605 --> 03:59.805
And checking the mail.
Okay, you're not helping.

03:59.807 --> 04:00.572
Oh, and turning
the lights off.

04:00.574 --> 04:03.208
And screaming at us
for not turning
the lights off.

04:03.210 --> 04:05.444
Always being annoyed
is not a hobby.

04:05.446 --> 04:08.046
He also screams when we
slide around in socks.

04:08.048 --> 04:09.081
Hey, stitches aren't free.

04:09.083 --> 04:11.750
Murray, the whole town
is gonna see this,

04:11.752 --> 04:14.152
and they're gonna think
the Businessman of the Year

04:14.154 --> 04:15.087
is a lazy lump.

04:15.089 --> 04:16.521
I'd say
more of a lovable loaf.

04:16.523 --> 04:19.224
You used to ride bikes
and go to museums

04:19.226 --> 04:19.958
and see plays.

04:19.960 --> 04:23.195
What happened
to the man I married?

04:24.999 --> 04:26.198
Dad rode a bike?

04:26.200 --> 04:27.633
Ha! That must have
looked nuts.

04:27.635 --> 04:30.435
That's like Charles Barkley
jockeying a horse.

04:30.437 --> 04:31.803
I can't even imagine that.

04:31.805 --> 04:32.904
Just go wait outside.

04:32.906 --> 04:34.873
ADULT ADAM:<i> And so to cover</i>
<i> for my dad's laziness,</i>

04:34.875 --> 04:37.242
<i> my mom spent the day</i>
<i> covering his award</i>

04:37.244 --> 04:38.710
<i> from the whole town.</i>
(COUGHS)

04:38.712 --> 04:41.380
Move along. Don't want
anyone to get my cold.

04:41.382 --> 04:43.181
Okay, mom's not gonna
let anyone see that plaque,

04:43.183 --> 04:45.550
so we're stuck here until
it closes down for the night.

04:45.552 --> 04:47.586
Damn it! This day
could not get any worse.

04:47.588 --> 04:50.088
(TIRES SCREECH)
Hey, kid,
take my clubs up front

04:50.090 --> 04:51.356
and return this cart
for me.

04:51.358 --> 04:52.724
Oh, balls!
He thinks you work here.

04:52.726 --> 04:55.794
Told you something special
happens every time I dress up.

04:55.796 --> 04:57.529
Whatever you're thinking,
no.

04:57.531 --> 04:59.131
But a random guy
just told us

04:59.133 --> 05:01.900
to tear around the golf course
and jump stuff.

05:01.902 --> 05:02.567
He didn't say that at all.

05:02.569 --> 05:05.103
What do you think?
Should I go?
Tell me to go, and I'll so go.

05:05.105 --> 05:07.439
Know what? I'm done
looking out for you guys.

05:07.441 --> 05:08.273
What's that supposed to mean?

05:08.275 --> 05:10.008
It means next year,
I'm going to college

05:10.010 --> 05:11.810
far, far away
from you jamokes.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.011
Consider this
a trial run.

05:13.013 --> 05:15.180
Your stupidity's
in your own hands.

05:15.182 --> 05:16.415
But that's a lot of pressure.

05:16.417 --> 05:18.083
(HORN HONKING)
Adam, it has a horn!

05:18.085 --> 05:18.583
A cute little horn!

05:18.585 --> 05:20.752
Oh, boy, here I go!
Thank you
for whatever you said.

05:20.754 --> 05:22.421
Let me honk the horn.
(HORN HONKS)

05:22.423 --> 05:24.122

05:24.325 --> 05:26.692
<i> ¶ Dare, dare to believe</i>
<i> you can survive</i>

05:26.694 --> 05:27.726
Whoo!

05:27.728 --> 05:29.494
I love being a badass!

05:29.496 --> 05:32.164
I'm like Smokey<i> and</i>
the bandit!

05:32.166 --> 05:34.032
Whoo!

05:34.034 --> 05:35.300
Aah!

05:36.270 --> 05:39.504
Fore! Whoo! Whoo!

05:39.506 --> 05:40.906
(LAUGHS)

05:40.908 --> 05:43.975
ADULT ADAM:<i> That day,</i>
<i> fate was on our side.</i>

05:43.977 --> 05:44.609
Best day ever!

05:44.611 --> 05:47.045
<i> Turns out,</i>
<i> a little construction</i>
<i> on the golf course</i>

05:47.047 --> 05:48.714
<i> created the perfect ramp.</i>

05:48.716 --> 05:51.683
Lucky for you,
it's about to get
a lot better!

05:51.685 --> 05:56.355
<i> ¶ Dare, dare to believe</i>
<i> you can ¶</i>

05:59.093 --> 06:01.193
Well, you were right.

06:01.195 --> 06:02.794
I could<i> not</i> jump it.

06:02.796 --> 06:05.063
We need Erica!
Go get Erica!

06:05.065 --> 06:06.131
Dude! You heard her.

06:06.133 --> 06:08.500
She's done dealing
with our awesome hijinks!

06:08.502 --> 06:09.835
I think this
is less hijinks

06:09.837 --> 06:11.937
and more of a... felony.

06:11.939 --> 06:12.838
We should run.

06:12.840 --> 06:15.540
ADULT ADAM:<i> While Barry</i>
<i> and I ran from the law,</i>

06:15.542 --> 06:19.177
<i> my dad was ready</i>
<i> to break out</i>
<i> of his old habits.</i>

06:19.179 --> 06:20.579
I've given this
a lot of thought.

06:20.581 --> 06:22.948
I don't want you
to think of me as a lump.

06:22.950 --> 06:26.251
So if it'll make you happy,

06:26.520 --> 06:27.352
I'll do a hobby.

06:27.354 --> 06:28.820
Oh, Murray,
that's such great news

06:28.822 --> 06:30.622
'cause I already got you
a hobby coach.

06:30.624 --> 06:32.657
What?
Well, I laid on the guilt
pretty thick.

06:32.659 --> 06:35.093
I knew you'd cave.
Dad, it's time!

06:35.095 --> 06:37.028
Do not parade your dad
out here.

06:37.030 --> 06:38.797
Don't do that.
Hey, hey.

06:38.799 --> 06:42.067
Who's ready to fill
his hobby hole?

06:42.069 --> 06:43.435
Okay, I don't have a hole.

06:43.437 --> 06:44.703
And if I<i> did</i> have a hole,

06:44.705 --> 06:46.138
I wouldn't want to fill it
with a hobby.

06:46.140 --> 06:47.839
Sure, you would.
Take it away, Dad.

06:47.841 --> 06:50.976
Okay, let's get
the hobby ball rolling

06:50.978 --> 06:54.146
with the greatest hobby
of them all...

06:54.148 --> 06:55.580
Music.

06:55.883 --> 06:59.584
(BANJO PLAYING)
<i> ¶ Won't you come home,</i>
<i> Bill Bailey?</i>

06:59.586 --> 07:01.653
<i> ¶ Won't you come home? ¶</i>

07:02.623 --> 07:04.256
You got to
bang the bongos, Mur.

07:04.258 --> 07:06.024
I don't want to
bang the bongos!

07:06.026 --> 07:07.392
Just bang the bongos.

07:07.394 --> 07:08.827
I'm not banging
the bongos!

07:08.829 --> 07:11.363
Just give the bongos
a little bang.

07:11.365 --> 07:14.633
If you want the bongos
banged so bad,
you bang the bongos!

07:14.635 --> 07:19.771
How can I bang the bongos
if I'm playing<i> Bill Bailey</i>
on the banjo?

07:19.773 --> 07:22.641
Murray, stop bickering
and bang the bongos!

07:22.643 --> 07:23.141
Aah!

07:23.143 --> 07:26.111
<i> ¶ Won't you come home,</i>
<i> Bill Bailey?</i>

07:26.113 --> 07:28.880
Hey, you got to bang
to the beat, Mur.

07:28.882 --> 07:30.582
You're not banging
to the beat.

07:30.584 --> 07:33.351
I'm trying the best I can!
This stinks.

07:33.353 --> 07:36.121
Maybe your hobby's
being an (BLEEP).

07:36.123 --> 07:37.055
What did you say?

07:37.057 --> 07:39.624
<i> ¶ Remember that rainy evening?</i>

07:39.626 --> 07:41.293
<i> ¶ I sent you out ¶</i>

07:41.295 --> 07:41.960
Okay, enough music.

07:41.962 --> 07:45.163
Clearly, this is something
I've got to get involved with.

07:45.165 --> 07:46.264
No, you don't!

07:46.266 --> 07:48.266
This brings me joy!

07:48.402 --> 07:50.268
Look, it's my hobby now.

07:50.270 --> 07:51.536
Come on, we'll find
a fun hobby

07:51.538 --> 07:55.106
that you and I can do
together,
like, uh, scrapbooking.

07:55.108 --> 07:56.208
Huh?
Jazzercise?

07:56.210 --> 07:57.576
Right.
Power walking?

07:57.578 --> 07:58.243
"Power walking"?

07:58.245 --> 08:00.745
Couponing?
Coupo... What the hell's...

08:00.747 --> 08:02.647
Well, what's that?
It's a way to save money.

08:02.649 --> 08:03.381
Oh. All right,
I'll do that one.

08:03.383 --> 08:06.551
Really? I mean,
there's so many better
things we could do

08:06.553 --> 08:08.086
where we'd be outside,
getting fresh air...

08:08.088 --> 08:09.988
No, I want to do the one
where we save money.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.723
Fine, I guess it's couponing.

08:11.725 --> 08:14.426
(LAUGHS) Yay,
my husband has a hobby.

08:14.428 --> 08:17.596
I think I just got too
ambitious with the bongos.

08:17.598 --> 08:18.897
Would you be open to clapping?

08:18.899 --> 08:21.600
Al! I don't want to
make any more sounds!

08:21.602 --> 08:24.503
ADULT ADAM:<i> As my dad</i>
<i> decided his new hobby</i>
<i> was saving money,</i>

08:24.505 --> 08:26.938
<i> Barry was coming up with</i>
<i> a plan to save our butts.</i>

08:26.940 --> 08:30.642
There it is,
gentlemen, the answer
to all our problems.

08:30.644 --> 08:31.710
Uh, how, exactly?

08:31.712 --> 08:34.779
Easy. We steal
Cecil the janitor's golf cart

08:34.781 --> 08:36.314
and replace the one we sunk.

08:36.316 --> 08:37.582
It's the perfect crime.

08:37.584 --> 08:39.150
But then
Cecil has no cart.

08:39.152 --> 08:40.018
Way ahead of you.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.353
We then steal
another golf cart

08:41.355 --> 08:43.221
from a different country club
to replace Cecil's.

08:43.223 --> 08:46.224
But then wouldn't
the second golf course
be missing their cart?

08:46.226 --> 08:48.760
Which is why we steal
and replace golf carts

08:48.762 --> 08:51.563
several times a day for
the rest of our natural lives.

08:51.565 --> 08:52.297
Isn't that
a Ponzi scheme, bro?

08:52.299 --> 08:56.268
Fonzie has nothing to do
with this, Matthew.
He drives a motorcycle.

08:56.270 --> 08:58.803
Not a Fonzie scheme,
dude, Ponzi.

08:58.805 --> 09:00.639
And that's exactly
what this is.

09:00.641 --> 09:01.940
Not at all.
All we got to do

09:01.942 --> 09:05.410
is swipe hundreds,
if not thousands,
of golf carts

09:05.412 --> 09:07.712
to keep our scam alive
until we grow old

09:07.714 --> 09:08.580
and our children
take our place!

09:08.582 --> 09:12.050
You really need to go
to your sister about this.
On my way.

09:14.454 --> 09:15.720
Erica, I need your help!

09:15.722 --> 09:17.155
Bup, bup!
We discussed this!

09:17.157 --> 09:20.125
My days of looking
after you are done.
You're a man now, right?

09:20.127 --> 09:23.595
Thing is, in this case,
I feel more like
a scared little boy

09:23.597 --> 09:25.063
who needs his big sister.

09:25.065 --> 09:25.363
God, no!

09:25.365 --> 09:29.167
Just pretend it's next year
and I'm at college.
What do you do then?

09:29.169 --> 09:30.335
Call you
on a special red phone

09:30.337 --> 09:32.704
so you can rush home
and fix my dumb mistakes?

09:32.706 --> 09:33.905
Look at me.

09:33.907 --> 09:34.839
There is no red phone.

09:34.841 --> 09:37.542
I am far away,
living an awesome life
without you.

09:37.544 --> 09:39.144
What about the house mother
in your sorority?

09:39.146 --> 09:41.813
Can she give you the message
between bikini tickle-fights?

09:41.815 --> 09:43.348
You really need
to stop watching

09:43.350 --> 09:44.616
<i> USA Up All Night</i>
boobie movies.

09:44.618 --> 09:48.520
So (SIGHS) you're not
gonna talk to me
when you're at college?

09:48.522 --> 09:50.855
No, but you'll see me
at Thanksgiving

09:50.857 --> 09:52.123
and when I
run out of money.

09:52.125 --> 09:54.993
I'm, like, reeling
right now.
You gave me no warning!

09:54.995 --> 09:58.129
I've been talking about
going to college
for the last four years!

09:58.131 --> 10:00.999
But it had no resonance
till this very moment!

10:01.001 --> 10:01.466
I'm okay with that.

10:01.468 --> 10:04.169
Please consider
forgoing college
and staying with me.

10:04.171 --> 10:05.270
That's so cute. No.

10:05.272 --> 10:06.137
Then you leave me
no choice.

10:06.139 --> 10:10.976
From this moment forth,
you are not the Erica
I need and depend on.

10:10.978 --> 10:12.777
Barry shall be my Erica!

10:12.779 --> 10:13.511
Here's a crazy idea.

10:13.513 --> 10:18.049
Why not make Adam
the Erica and just
figure it out yourself?

10:18.051 --> 10:18.283
Never!

10:18.285 --> 10:21.386
Barry will shepherd
and guide me through life
like a bright North Star,

10:21.388 --> 10:23.989
and from now on, I'm putting
all my trust and faith

10:23.991 --> 10:27.092
in Barry,
a.k.a. new Erica.

10:27.094 --> 10:27.792
Great news!

10:27.794 --> 10:31.463
I stole Cecil's cart
to replace the one we sunk.

10:31.465 --> 10:33.965
Our life of crime
begins now!

10:33.967 --> 10:35.333
(SIGHS)

10:35.335 --> 10:37.002
Well, I guess that's my cue.

10:37.004 --> 10:38.436
Guess so.

10:45.946 --> 10:49.848
<i> Surprisingly, Barry's complex</i>

<i> without a hitch.</i>

10:49.850 --> 10:52.784
Okay, we're just gonna abandon
this thing by the clubhouse,

10:52.786 --> 10:54.619
and they'll never know
the difference.

10:54.621 --> 10:56.688
Wow. This plan
actually can work.

10:56.690 --> 10:57.989
I'm so glad
you're my new Erica.

10:57.991 --> 10:59.824
Your what?
I'm just saying,
with her ditching me,

10:59.826 --> 11:02.827
you're now entirely
responsible for
my future and safety.

11:02.829 --> 11:04.963
Noice. Now, let's floor
this bad boy

11:04.965 --> 11:06.798
and jump that hill again.

11:06.800 --> 11:09.200
Uh, not to second-guess you,
New Erica,

11:09.202 --> 11:11.903
but we've already tried this,
and it went real bad for us.

11:11.905 --> 11:14.773
But the new cart
is so much sleeker, Adam.

11:14.775 --> 11:16.241
It has a janitor broom
on the back

11:16.243 --> 11:18.443
that acts as a wing
to lift us to the heavens.

11:18.445 --> 11:20.512
There's no way you
believe that's real, right?

11:20.514 --> 11:22.414
Trust your New Erica.

11:22.649 --> 11:24.249

11:32.225 --> 11:32.624

Why aren't we
triumphantly soaring through
the air like falcons?

11:36.263 --> 11:37.362
Thank God.
We bottomed out.

11:37.364 --> 11:39.998

jump on the back

out of here.

I'm good!
Why do you keep saying
you're good?

12:02.422 --> 12:04.489
There's no way you're good.
I'll go get Erica.

this is a big moment.

I have never given
my coupon pouch
to another human person.

I don't need it.
Look right here.

12:43.764 --> 12:46.631
Packaged pastrami,
with this circular,
two for one.

12:46.633 --> 12:48.933
And where'd you get that?
They were at
the front of the store.

12:48.935 --> 12:51.803
Yeah, because
the store circular
is a sucker's play.

12:51.805 --> 12:54.939
My babies do not
eat pastrami wrapped
in deadly plastic.

12:54.941 --> 12:57.709

practically giving away
canned meats.

Whoo-hoo,
I got myself a hobby!

13:04.518 --> 13:06.718
But you're picking
all the wrong stuff.

13:06.720 --> 13:08.920
The point of couponing
is to find savings

13:08.922 --> 13:10.655
on things
you actually want.

13:10.657 --> 13:12.023
And I want to save money.

13:12.025 --> 13:14.425

They got canned bananas.

You buy fives,
you get 10 free!

Yeah, we're going
to Red Lobster.

So cute and fun and...
What the hell are those?

13:50.697 --> 13:53.932
They're lake lobsters,
same tender meat

13:53.934 --> 13:55.466
There's only two.
They're bite-sized.

13:55.468 --> 13:57.902
Yeah, they looked
bigger in the bed

It's fine.

Just cook 'em up.

Um, I was kind of thinking
maybe you could touch them,

makes my skin crawl.

full price for this.

15:55.055 --> 15:56.387
I regret nothing.

15:56.389 --> 16:00.458
Your coarse single-ply
is sandpapering our tushies.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.060
Poor Adam can barely walk.

16:02.062 --> 16:03.294
Single-ply builds character.

16:03.296 --> 16:06.097
Let's just go back to
the way things were, okay?

16:06.099 --> 16:08.833
Back to you watching TV
and being comfortable.

16:08.835 --> 16:12.103
I thought you were embarrassed
by your dumb lump of a husband

16:12.105 --> 16:15.573
who doesn't go to plays
and doesn't go to museums

16:15.575 --> 16:17.942
and doesn't ride a bike
like some European.

16:17.944 --> 16:20.011
Well, I didn't mean it
like that.

16:20.013 --> 16:20.378
Yes, you did!

16:20.380 --> 16:24.115
You blocked that plaque
with your body
and you called me names

16:24.117 --> 16:25.450
and you hurt my feelings.

16:25.452 --> 16:28.786
Since when do your feelings
ever get hurt?

16:29.456 --> 16:30.922
Since now.

16:30.924 --> 16:35.760
All I was trying to do
was remind you
of the man you married.

16:35.762 --> 16:38.296
Guess I'm terrible
at that, too.

16:45.071 --> 16:48.639
ADULT ADAM:<i> It had been</i>

<i> pinned under a golf cart,</i>

16:48.641 --> 16:50.508

<i> he was still trapped.</i>

16:50.510 --> 16:51.209
Aah, I'm wedged
even worse!

16:51.211 --> 16:55.513
<i> In classic Barry fashion,</i>
<i> each new plan was</i>
<i> shoddier than the last.</i>

16:55.515 --> 16:56.280
Okay. Here's the plan.

16:56.282 --> 17:00.051
I need you to dig down
and use a sudden burst
of super strength

17:00.053 --> 17:01.486
to pull this cart off me.

17:01.488 --> 17:02.887
Wha... I don't
have super strength!

17:02.889 --> 17:06.424
Come on, it's like when a mom
pulls a car off her kid!

17:06.426 --> 17:08.326
I can do this!
Save baby Barry.

17:08.328 --> 17:11.996
I'm a mama, and you're
my scrumptious little boopie!

17:12.732 --> 17:13.865
(GRUNTING)

17:13.867 --> 17:14.766
Oh, no.
It's working?

17:14.768 --> 17:18.136
How do you get "It's working"
from "Oh, no"?

17:18.138 --> 17:19.070
I split my pants.

17:19.072 --> 17:21.906
Ha! Get over here
and show me your butt

17:21.908 --> 17:23.174
so I can call you
a lame nerd.

17:23.176 --> 17:25.877
No time.
I got to fix this.
Come on, think.

17:25.879 --> 17:27.678
What would Erica do?
Think. What would Erica do?

17:27.680 --> 17:31.849
ADULT ADAM:<i> Lucky for me,</i>
<i> Erica was always there</i>
<i> when I needed her most.</i>

17:31.851 --> 17:34.552
Erica would say,
"Move aside," 'cause she's
gonna take care of it.

17:34.554 --> 17:35.553
Who's saying that?
Is that Erica?

17:35.555 --> 17:38.990
Why are you here?
I thought you got into college
and were done helping.

17:38.992 --> 17:41.859
True, but then I figured,
eh, probably shouldn't

17:41.861 --> 17:43.995
let Barry get crushed
under a golf cart.

17:43.997 --> 17:46.297
Answer me!
Is that Erica talking?

17:46.299 --> 17:48.099
ADULT ADAM:
<i> It was Erica, all right.</i>

17:48.101 --> 17:49.400
(WHISTLES)

17:49.402 --> 17:50.368
<i> And she wasn't alone.</i>

<i> If there was one thing</i>
<i> our sister was good at,</i>

17:51.971 --> 17:56.007
<i> it was knowing how to</i>
<i> bail her little brothers</i>
<i> out of trouble.</i>

17:56.009 --> 17:57.575
Answer me.
Is it Erica?

17:57.577 --> 17:59.310
<i> And that day, she knew</i>
<i> the answer would be</i>

17:59.312 --> 18:01.245
<i> to bring in</i>
<i> the reinforcements.</i>

18:01.247 --> 18:02.580
JTP, do your thing.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.649
You know it.
Let's do this!

ALL: JTP!

18:13.426 --> 18:14.759
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
don't celebrate yet.

18:14.761 --> 18:18.096
Andy, Matt, Naked Rob,
go to the lake
and pull out the old cart.

18:18.098 --> 18:19.297
Roger that.
Copy.
Let's move.

18:19.299 --> 18:22.133
Barry, return Cecil's
cart to school
before he gets fired.

18:22.135 --> 18:23.901
That seems fair!
Geoff, go to Red Lobster

18:23.903 --> 18:25.503
and book a booth
by the window.

18:25.505 --> 18:27.105
Yes, my love!

18:27.407 --> 18:27.905
What about me?

18:27.907 --> 18:30.908
You're good just being
my annoying little brother.

18:31.411 --> 18:32.810
Thanks.

18:32.812 --> 18:35.980
You know, I'm really gonna
miss you next year.

18:37.383 --> 18:39.317
Me, too.
Really?

18:39.319 --> 18:39.951
Yeah.

18:39.953 --> 18:44.755
No matter where I end up,
I'll always be your sister.

Hey, can we talk?

19:10.116 --> 19:13.251
About what? I'm doing
what you asked me to do.
I'm sitting in my chair.

19:13.253 --> 19:17.321
Murray, the last thing
I'd ever want to do
is hurt your feelings.

19:17.323 --> 19:18.322
Well, you were right.

19:18.324 --> 19:21.626
Look at me.
I'm not the same man
you married.

19:21.628 --> 19:24.896
No. You're better.

19:29.469 --> 19:30.835
Look at me.
I got hobbies.

19:30.837 --> 19:33.938
"Checking the thermostat,
closing the windows,

19:33.940 --> 19:35.673
"making sure
the gas tank is full."

19:35.675 --> 19:40.144
And, of course, being a dad,
being my husband.

19:40.146 --> 19:40.878
Those aren't hobbies.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.313
Well, they're the only ones
that matter to me.
