WEBVTT

00:03.699 --> 00:04.047
.

00:04.091 --> 00:06.310
- With the suggestion
from Dr. Cooper

00:06.354 --> 00:08.312
I could've sabotaged
Archer's CVP monitor

00:08.356 --> 00:10.401
so that the Vas-COM
could save the day.

00:10.445 --> 00:12.099
And I came close to doing it.

00:12.142 --> 00:14.231
- If this ever gets
to be too much for you,

00:14.275 --> 00:16.190
I'll put a stop
to the whole thing.

00:16.799 --> 00:18.105
- I'll take it from here.

00:18.148 --> 00:19.628
- I assumed I'd perform
the surgery.

00:19.671 --> 00:20.890
- You're free to watch.

00:20.933 --> 00:24.633
- Best by the powers that be.
- I'm sorry.

00:24.676 --> 00:26.809
I made a fool of myself
with Dr. Marcel.

00:26.852 --> 00:29.159
I'm crushing on my advisor.

00:29.812 --> 00:31.118
- How long
you been doing this?

00:31.161 --> 00:33.076
- 35 years.
- How?

00:33.120 --> 00:35.078
- You got to hang on
to those good days.

00:35.122 --> 00:36.732
You got to hang on
to those wins.

00:42.346 --> 00:45.480
- Really, Dad?
- What? It's fine.

00:45.523 --> 00:48.091
- It's a red zone.
It's for emergencies only.

00:50.485 --> 00:52.095
No--
- See?

00:52.139 --> 00:53.444
Now, it's an emergency.

00:53.488 --> 00:56.882
Oh, you know what?
I wanna check this out.

00:56.926 --> 00:58.536
New PDT system.

00:58.580 --> 01:01.322
I can check all
of my units in real time.

01:01.365 --> 01:02.540
- But, look,
can I check it out later?

01:02.584 --> 01:04.194
I really do have to go.
I'm late.

01:04.238 --> 01:07.371
- Everything okay here?
- Oh, yeah, we all good.

01:07.415 --> 01:08.807
Just a little ride-along.

01:08.851 --> 01:11.201
Letting a civilian see
what a real job looks like.

01:11.245 --> 01:13.725
- Yeah, thanks.
- Yeah.

01:13.769 --> 01:15.901
Am I embarrassing you?

01:15.945 --> 01:17.207
- I'll see you later.

01:18.469 --> 01:19.644
[siren beeps]

01:19.688 --> 01:22.212
Come on, Dad.
- [laughs]

01:22.256 --> 01:24.867
[siren beeps]
Okay, I'm gone.

01:27.261 --> 01:29.915
- [laughs]

01:29.959 --> 01:32.570
- Hey, what's up?

01:32.614 --> 01:33.963
- Do you remember
how when we were

01:34.006 --> 01:36.618
in physical exam class,
when we did breast exams,

01:36.661 --> 01:38.141
they would tell us
to make small talk

01:38.185 --> 01:39.229
with the patient actors?

01:39.273 --> 01:40.535
- Yeah, to help
put them at ease.

01:40.578 --> 01:42.798
- Yeah and there was
that one guy, Mandelbrot.

01:42.841 --> 01:44.756
Super awkward.
Caught hell for asking

01:44.800 --> 01:46.584
one of them what
she was doing that weekend.

01:46.628 --> 01:48.804
- Oh.
- He is a panelist

01:48.847 --> 01:51.676
at the next summit
for female physicians.

01:51.720 --> 01:56.159
[laughs]
- Wait, that wasn't Mandelbrot.

01:56.203 --> 01:57.247
It was Richardson.

01:57.291 --> 01:58.727
- No, pretty sure
it was Mandelbrot.

01:58.770 --> 02:02.818
- No, it was Richardson.
- You haven't changed a bit.

02:02.861 --> 02:05.560
Always got to one-up me.
- I'm not trying to one-up you.

02:05.603 --> 02:07.779
- Two shots for Dr. Hammer.
Three for Dr. Halstead.

02:07.823 --> 02:12.436
- [laughs] Thank you.

02:12.480 --> 02:14.786
Have a good day.
- You too. Thanks, Carly.

02:14.830 --> 02:18.181
- Morning.
- Good morning.

02:18.225 --> 02:21.184
Dr. Halstead, how are things
with Dr. Cooper?

02:21.228 --> 02:24.231
- Uh, pretty well, I think.
- Oh, yeah?

02:24.274 --> 02:26.798
- I mean, he hasn't said
anything otherwise.

02:26.842 --> 02:28.626
- Good morning,
Ms. Goodwin, Will.

02:28.670 --> 02:30.411
- Matt.

02:30.454 --> 02:31.586
- Just the man
I was looking for.

02:31.629 --> 02:32.456
I want to tell you about
the conference

02:32.500 --> 02:33.849
coming up in a few weeks.

02:33.892 --> 02:35.546
- National Critical Care
Society annual meeting.

02:35.590 --> 02:37.461
- It's here in Chicago.
You should go.

02:37.505 --> 02:39.637
Vasik's gonna be
a platinum sponsor.

02:39.681 --> 02:41.639
They're gonna have
a corner booth.

02:41.683 --> 02:43.250
It's gonna be
the perfect chance

02:43.293 --> 02:44.729
for you to meet
some of the upper-level execs.

02:46.470 --> 02:49.821
Oh, do you think that you could
spare him for the day?

02:49.865 --> 02:51.867
- It's always good
when our doctors

02:51.910 --> 02:53.477
broaden their expertise.

02:53.521 --> 02:55.479
- I'll be there.
- Okay, great.

02:55.523 --> 02:58.613
I'll get you the details.
Um, Ms. Goodwin.

03:00.267 --> 03:02.660
- This might be good.

03:02.704 --> 03:06.447
And maybe I can get them to
offer me a deal like Cooper's.

03:06.490 --> 03:08.144
[phone buzzes]

03:08.188 --> 03:12.453
- Geez, I got to get this, but,
uh, you're on the right track.

03:15.020 --> 03:18.023
- Thank you, La'Shawn.
Morning, Alim.

03:18.067 --> 03:19.242
Hey.
- Hey.

03:19.286 --> 03:20.417
- What time did you get in?

03:20.461 --> 03:22.680
- Uh, I don't know.
Like, around four.

03:22.724 --> 03:24.421
- Why so early?

03:24.465 --> 03:25.857
- Always try to get
a leg up on the day.

03:27.032 --> 03:28.991
- Two hours before your shift?

03:29.034 --> 03:30.949
- Well, if I'm meeting
with my patients earlier,

03:30.993 --> 03:32.473
then I can read up
on their conditions.

03:32.516 --> 03:34.257
That way, I'm running rounds,
I'll have all the answers.

03:34.301 --> 03:35.345
Plus, if I'm here
a little early,

03:35.389 --> 03:36.781
I can study for my boards.

03:36.825 --> 03:39.262
- Sleep ever a factor
in this equation?

03:39.306 --> 03:41.438
- Life of an intern.
What can I tell ya?

03:41.482 --> 03:42.700
- Dr. Marcel.
- Yeah.

03:42.744 --> 03:45.529
- Treatment three incoming.
[bell beeping]

03:45.573 --> 03:46.617
- What do we got?

03:46.661 --> 03:48.358
- Avery Quinn,
28-year-old female.

03:48.402 --> 03:51.405
Pedestrian versus auto.
BP 80/45.

03:51.448 --> 03:53.537
Heart rate 114, satting at 88.

03:53.581 --> 03:54.886
- Okay, Avery, I'm Dr. Marcel.

03:54.930 --> 03:56.061
We're gonna take
good care of you, okay?

03:56.105 --> 03:57.715
- It hurts so much.

03:57.759 --> 03:59.587
- Trigger the MTP,
give her 50 of fentanyl.

04:01.066 --> 04:03.460
Here we go, guys.
Transfer on my count.

04:03.504 --> 04:06.550
One, two, three.
- [groans]

04:06.594 --> 04:09.553
- There it is.
All right, let's roll her.

04:09.597 --> 04:12.295
You're okay, we got you.
The board...

04:12.339 --> 04:16.734
- [groans]

04:16.778 --> 04:19.911
- All right, we're good.

04:19.955 --> 04:22.392
Avery, can you put
your arms by your side for me?

04:22.436 --> 04:23.785
You're gonna feel
a little bit of pressure, okay?

04:25.961 --> 04:28.311
- [groans]
- O2 sats down to 82.

04:28.355 --> 04:31.401
- Avery, Avery.
Avery...she's out.

04:31.445 --> 04:33.751
We need to intubate.
20 of etomidate, 100 of sux.

04:33.795 --> 04:36.537
Get a CBC, CMP,
type and cross four units.

04:36.580 --> 04:38.756
Let's get a fastscan
and have them prep OR 12.

04:38.800 --> 04:41.585
- No, she's going to OR seven.
- Excuse me?

04:41.629 --> 04:42.934
- Yeah, I'll take it from here.

04:42.978 --> 04:45.502
And let's add
a coag panel and LFTs.

04:45.546 --> 04:46.982
- Dr. Blake,
I think you're mistaken.

04:47.025 --> 04:49.071
This is a trauma,
not a transplant surgery.

04:49.114 --> 04:51.029
- Yeah, I can see that.

04:51.073 --> 04:53.510
She's got free fluid,
and she's in shock.

04:53.554 --> 04:55.077
Her liver's ruptured
but repairable.

04:55.120 --> 04:58.036
We got to get her up now.
- I'm in. Bag her.

04:58.080 --> 05:01.779
All do respect, Dr. Blake,
you're a transplant surgeon.

05:01.823 --> 05:03.781
I got this.
- Thank you, Dr. Marcel,

05:03.825 --> 05:05.348
but I'll be
taking over the case now.

05:05.392 --> 05:06.784
- I'm sorry,
I can't let you do that.

05:06.828 --> 05:08.264
This is my patient.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.310
- And I understand that,
but she's also my daughter.

05:11.615 --> 05:13.008
Now, I'm gonna need you
to move.

05:13.051 --> 05:14.749
Let's go.

05:14.792 --> 05:21.712
[dramatic music]

05:21.756 --> 05:23.758
- You got a transplant patient?

05:23.801 --> 05:25.847
- No, I don't.

05:25.890 --> 05:27.544
But we have a problem.

05:27.588 --> 05:33.333
â™ª

05:42.385 --> 05:42.777
.

05:42.820 --> 05:44.866
- Hey, Alex, I'm Dr. Scott.

05:44.909 --> 05:46.215
- I'm Susan.
This is Todd.

05:46.258 --> 05:49.087
And this is Ry--Ryan, come on.

05:49.131 --> 05:51.525
- Hey, Ryan, can I get
a couple of those?

05:53.353 --> 05:56.225
- Ryan, enough with the gloves,
okay?

05:56.268 --> 05:58.183
- Thanks. [laughs]

05:58.227 --> 06:01.796
Alex, says here that you

06:01.839 --> 06:04.059
got hit in the head
with a Nerf gun.

06:04.102 --> 06:07.062
- Yeah.
- Oof, I bet that hurt.

06:07.105 --> 06:10.195
The thing is, you're supposed
to get hit with the foam dart,

06:10.239 --> 06:11.545
not the actual gun.
[chuckles]

06:11.588 --> 06:13.285
- Stop it.

06:13.329 --> 06:16.419
- It was an accident.
The boys were playing.

06:16.463 --> 06:18.421
- Mom, it wasn't a Nerf gun.
- Okay.

06:18.465 --> 06:20.075
I--I didn't even see it happen.
I--okay.

06:20.118 --> 06:21.119
- Ryan.
- Mom---mom.

06:21.163 --> 06:22.294
- Hey, just a minute.
- Mom--

06:22.338 --> 06:23.470
- They were down in
the basement and--

06:23.513 --> 06:24.906
- It wasn't a Nerf gun.
- Ryan, okay.

06:24.949 --> 06:26.603
- Hey, hey, hey, Ryan.

06:26.647 --> 06:28.257
What's up, buddy?
Talk to me.

06:28.300 --> 06:30.955
- It was an Ultra Blaster.
- Oh, yeah?

06:30.999 --> 06:33.001
Triple action
with the slam-fire?

06:33.044 --> 06:36.134
- Uh-huh.
- Sweet. Yeah.

06:36.178 --> 06:38.310
- "I'm sorry, Doctor"?

06:38.354 --> 06:39.616
Todd, you want to take him
for a walk to the truck?

06:39.660 --> 06:42.140
Give him his meds.
Okay, go with Dad. Go.

06:46.318 --> 06:49.409
- Oh, man.
Tough day, huh, bro?

06:49.452 --> 06:51.149
- He has ADHD.

06:51.193 --> 06:52.934
- Yeah, we have him
on Adderall,

06:52.977 --> 06:54.979
but we keep upping the dose,

06:55.023 --> 06:56.459
and some days
are just a little tough.

06:56.503 --> 06:59.506
- [whispers] I know.
It's okay.

06:59.549 --> 07:02.030
What about you?
How you doing?

07:03.031 --> 07:04.293
- [whispers] I'm fine.

07:04.336 --> 07:06.121
- You sure?

07:07.470 --> 07:09.211
Okay then.

07:09.254 --> 07:11.082
For now, we're gonna keep
applying pressure

07:11.126 --> 07:13.215
and get you all stitched up.
Shouldn't be too long.

07:19.395 --> 07:22.485
Hey, Mags, I need somebody
to throw stitches in six.

07:22.529 --> 07:23.573
- I'm on it.

07:23.617 --> 07:25.009
- You already have
two patients up.

07:25.053 --> 07:26.141
You sure you have time?
- Don't worry.

07:26.184 --> 07:27.403
I got it.

07:33.409 --> 07:34.410
- [sighs]

07:35.716 --> 07:37.544
- Rough morning, huh?
- Yeah.

07:37.587 --> 07:39.284
It's a tricky family dynamic.

07:39.328 --> 07:41.025
I'm treating
a 10-year-old named Alex.

07:41.069 --> 07:42.244
His brother has ADHD.

07:42.287 --> 07:43.419
Seems like
it's pretty tough on them.

07:43.463 --> 07:44.638
- Yeah.

07:44.681 --> 07:46.030
- Takes up a lot
of the family's energy.

07:46.074 --> 07:47.423
- Oh, yeah.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.991
Parents so focused
on--on the kid with the illness

07:50.034 --> 07:52.297
that they see right through
the other one.

07:52.341 --> 07:54.082
Yeah, unfortunately
not at all uncommon.

07:54.125 --> 07:56.084
There's even a name for it.
It's called--it's called

07:56.127 --> 07:57.433
glass child syndrome.

07:57.477 --> 07:59.696
- Oh, that sounds like
exactly what's happening.

07:59.740 --> 08:02.046
- Yeah, happy to provide you
with a couple referrals

08:02.090 --> 08:03.526
for a therapist
for the--for the kid

08:03.570 --> 08:05.049
if you think the parents'll
be open to it.

08:05.093 --> 08:06.224
- I think that'd be great.
Thanks.

08:06.268 --> 08:08.226
[phone buzzes]
- Oh.

08:08.270 --> 08:09.619
Dr. Choi,
I've been bugging him

08:09.663 --> 08:11.142
for an update on his rehab.
I better take this.

08:11.186 --> 08:13.318
- Go ahead, man, and tell him
I look forward to meeting.

08:13.362 --> 08:14.189
- Will do.

08:16.278 --> 08:17.714
- I understand
this must be hard for you,

08:17.758 --> 08:19.716
but that's the very reason
I can't let you go in there.

08:19.760 --> 08:21.718
- I appreciate your concern,
but I'm fine.

08:21.762 --> 08:23.590
- Dr. Blake.
- Ms. Goodwin.

08:23.633 --> 08:26.418
- You know very well
it's against hospital policy

08:26.462 --> 08:28.029
to operate on a family member.

08:28.072 --> 08:30.161
- I am perfectly qualified
to perform this surgery.

08:30.205 --> 08:32.512
- Pamela, you are
a transplant surgeon.

08:32.555 --> 08:34.209
- Dr. Archer and I
see these cases every day.

08:34.252 --> 08:35.732
- And I make more money
for this hospital

08:35.776 --> 08:39.083
than any other doctor here.
- That is not the point.

08:40.476 --> 08:43.305
Dr. Archer is
a top trauma surgeon.

08:43.348 --> 08:46.526
He will do an excellent job.

08:48.049 --> 08:49.746
- I will,
and if you're so inclined,

08:49.790 --> 08:51.705
I'd be happy
to have you observe.

08:51.748 --> 08:57.972
â™ª

09:05.066 --> 09:06.371
- Ryan.
- Ryan--

09:06.415 --> 09:09.287
can you sit still
for just one minute?

09:09.331 --> 09:10.985
- [sighs] I'm gonna go
get some air.

09:11.028 --> 09:12.377
- Yeah.

09:17.513 --> 09:19.515
- Will, can I get
your opinion on something?

09:19.559 --> 09:22.170
- Sure.
What's going on?

09:22.213 --> 09:23.563
- I've got a 71-year-old woman

09:23.606 --> 09:25.608
who's hypotensive
and tachycardic.

09:25.652 --> 09:27.305
Passed out this morning
at home.

09:27.349 --> 09:29.786
No medical history
other than asthma.

09:29.830 --> 09:31.614
She could use
some cardiac monitoring,

09:31.658 --> 09:33.311
and I know that
you're big on the Vas-COM.

09:33.355 --> 09:34.704
- Well, I mean, there are
a number

09:34.748 --> 09:38.099
of good cardiac output
monitors.

09:38.142 --> 09:40.580
But the Vas-COM
is a terrific device.

09:40.623 --> 09:42.625
You mind if I, uh,
have a look at her?

09:42.669 --> 09:44.279
See if she's a good candidate?
- Yeah, yeah, sure.

09:48.370 --> 09:50.328
- Eleanor, Ron,
this is Dr. Halstead.

09:50.372 --> 09:51.634
- Hi.

09:51.678 --> 09:52.940
- He's just going to ask you
a few questions.

09:52.983 --> 09:55.072
- Nice to meet you.
- You have to help her.

09:55.116 --> 09:56.334
Ellie, tell him,

09:56.378 --> 09:57.640
you've never been sick
a day in your life.

09:57.684 --> 10:00.643
- Ron--
- No, no, that's good to hear.

10:00.687 --> 10:02.645
You mind if I?
- Mm-hm.

10:02.689 --> 10:04.038
- Make a fist.

10:05.430 --> 10:07.432
And release.
- [sighs]

10:07.476 --> 10:08.782
- Good.

10:08.825 --> 10:10.435
Does she have
any sensitivities or allergies?

10:10.479 --> 10:12.220
Recent injuries,
meds that would interfere

10:12.263 --> 10:14.657
with an arterial line?
- Just seasonal allergies.

10:14.701 --> 10:17.355
- Okay. Eleanor, do you
ever have any trouble

10:17.399 --> 10:20.054
when you get your blood drawn?
- I don't think so.

10:20.097 --> 10:24.362
- What about leg swelling?
Long car rides, trips?

10:24.406 --> 10:26.190
- No, not that I can remember.

10:28.497 --> 10:29.672
- That's good.

10:29.716 --> 10:32.109
All right, it was nice
to meet you.

10:32.153 --> 10:33.850
I'll have a chat
with Dr. Hammer.

10:33.894 --> 10:35.069
We'll be right back.

10:37.724 --> 10:39.508
- What do you think?
She look good for the Vas-COM?

10:39.551 --> 10:40.814
- Uh, maybe.

10:40.857 --> 10:42.554
She was
a little vague in her answers.

10:42.598 --> 10:43.686
- But she definitely
should have

10:43.730 --> 10:45.253
her cardiac output monitored?

10:45.296 --> 10:47.255
- Dr. Hammer,
if you're interested,

10:47.298 --> 10:48.604
I could give you copies

10:48.648 --> 10:51.868
of the Vas-COM's FDA-approved
usage criteria?

10:51.912 --> 10:54.088
- You know, that--that
won't be necessary.

10:54.131 --> 10:56.394
I think Eleanor would be
a great candidate.

10:56.438 --> 10:58.614
- Okay, good.
I'll get it set up.

11:05.229 --> 11:07.144
- Dr. Scott.
- Alex?

11:07.188 --> 11:08.798
- Dr. Taylor.
- Buddy? What?

11:08.842 --> 11:10.670
Alex.
- Bud...

11:10.713 --> 11:13.716
- Excuse me.
- Honey, honey?

11:13.760 --> 11:15.849
What--what's happening?
- He's having a seizure.

11:15.892 --> 11:18.547
Give him 12 liters of O2
and .five of Ativan.

11:18.590 --> 11:20.505
- Wait, seizure?
Why is he having a seizure?

11:20.549 --> 11:21.724
- I'm not sure yet.

11:21.768 --> 11:23.465
[whispers]
Come on.

11:23.508 --> 11:26.555
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

11:26.598 --> 11:32.604
â™ª

11:34.563 --> 11:37.174
Hey, Alex, you with me?

11:37.218 --> 11:38.785
- Uh-huh.

11:38.828 --> 11:40.482
- [whispers] Okay.

11:40.525 --> 11:46.575
â™ª

11:46.618 --> 11:48.925
We're gonna figure this out
as soon as we can.

11:48.969 --> 11:50.579
Dr. Taylor.

11:50.622 --> 11:52.755
â™ª

11:52.799 --> 11:55.410
- Hi, hi, okay.
It's okay.

11:55.453 --> 11:57.325
- Has that cut been bleeding
like that the whole time?

11:57.368 --> 11:59.153
- I tried holding pressure,
but it didn't work.

11:59.196 --> 12:00.545
And if I would've tried
to stitch too soon,

12:00.589 --> 12:01.721
he would've got a hematoma.

12:01.764 --> 12:02.765
- He could have
a bleeding disorder.

12:02.809 --> 12:04.288
Did you order coags?

12:04.332 --> 12:06.856
- Um, well, no. I--
- Get a coag panel, Maggie.

12:06.900 --> 12:08.771
And let CT know
we're on our way.

12:08.815 --> 12:11.600
- Wait, do you think he
could have a subdural hematoma?

12:11.643 --> 12:13.602
- Yes, and if he does have
a bleeding disorder,

12:13.645 --> 12:15.169
then the trauma
from getting hit in the head

12:15.212 --> 12:16.518
could've caused
a bleed in the skull,

12:16.561 --> 12:18.781
which means he could herniate
at any moment.

12:18.825 --> 12:20.391
All right, now.
Let's go.

12:20.435 --> 12:23.568
â™ª

12:23.612 --> 12:25.570
- [whispering]
Oh, my God.

12:28.922 --> 12:29.139
.

12:29.183 --> 12:31.576
- Okay, ready to release
the pringle.

12:31.620 --> 12:33.796
- Hold on, I didn't get
a good look at the duodenum.

12:33.840 --> 12:36.625
- It's clear.
- Okay.

12:36.668 --> 12:37.887
- All right, pulling back
on the lap.

12:37.931 --> 12:39.671
[heart monitor beeping]

12:39.715 --> 12:41.151
Looks good.

12:42.152 --> 12:43.806
- What's her pH and temp?

12:43.850 --> 12:45.852
- 7.34 and 36.9.

12:45.895 --> 12:47.810
- All right, looks like
you're good to close.

12:47.854 --> 12:52.119
- Uh, actually, we're just
gonna pack and leave her open.

12:52.162 --> 12:53.773
- No, her bleeding's
under control.

12:53.816 --> 12:55.949
Packing her isn't necessary.
- I disagree.

12:55.992 --> 12:57.777
She's got a grade four
liver laceration.

12:57.820 --> 12:59.256
The risk of re-bleeding
is too high.

12:59.300 --> 13:00.997
- She's a healthy 28-year-old.

13:01.041 --> 13:02.825
Leaving her open puts her
at increased risk

13:02.869 --> 13:05.654
for infection, coagulopathy,
hypothermia, and acidosis.

13:05.697 --> 13:07.830
- Dr. Blake, I--
- Close her up, doctor.

13:07.874 --> 13:10.572
- I understand your concerns.
- No, no, point well taken.

13:10.615 --> 13:12.313
I see the merit
in what Dr. Blake is saying.

13:12.356 --> 13:13.836
- Dr. Archer--
- All right, hold off

13:13.880 --> 13:15.838
on the lap.
I need Celox, Gelfoam,

13:15.882 --> 13:18.754
and get an O Max
and suture for Dr. Marcel.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.843
- Dr. Archer, you--
- Dr. Marcel.

13:20.887 --> 13:23.672
â™ª

13:23.715 --> 13:25.065
[knocking]

13:25.108 --> 13:27.589
- Mr. and Mrs. Miller,
I'm Dr. Charles.

13:27.632 --> 13:29.286
I had been consulting

13:29.330 --> 13:31.854
with--with Dr. Scott
on Alex's case.

13:31.898 --> 13:34.161
- Psychiatry?
- Head injury.

13:34.204 --> 13:36.250
You know, can't be too careful.

13:36.293 --> 13:38.295
Anyway, Dr. Scott wanted me
to let you know that

13:38.339 --> 13:41.211
Alex's scans are almost ready.
And in the meantime,

13:41.255 --> 13:42.691
is there anything
I can get you?

13:42.734 --> 13:43.866
A bottle of water?
- Thank you, but we're fine.

13:43.910 --> 13:45.259
- Yeah.
[cell phone buzzes]

13:45.302 --> 13:46.651
Oh, sorry.
This is work.

13:46.695 --> 13:48.697
Um, don't forget
to text my parents.

13:48.740 --> 13:49.959
Excuse me.
- Oh, okay. Yep.

13:51.221 --> 13:52.657
- Ryan? Is it Ryan?
How about you, buddy?

13:52.701 --> 13:55.225
Can I get you something?
- Do you mind if I...

13:55.269 --> 13:56.357
- No, not at all.
- Okay, I'll be right back.

13:56.400 --> 13:58.881
- Not at all.

13:58.925 --> 14:02.232
- Would you, uh,
like a sandwich or something?

14:04.278 --> 14:07.020
No? Bag of chips?

14:07.063 --> 14:09.370
Soda?
Anything at all?

14:09.413 --> 14:12.025
- No!
You interrupted me.

14:12.068 --> 14:15.289
- Oh, I'm sorry.
I, uh, I--I didn't mean to.

14:15.332 --> 14:17.900
- Now I have to start
all over again.

14:17.944 --> 14:21.382
- Oh, you were counting.
Huh?

14:21.425 --> 14:24.254
Okay, well, I'm--again,
I'm very sorry.

14:24.298 --> 14:26.300
You--you get back to that.
All right?

14:28.084 --> 14:32.915
- Mr. and Mrs. Miller, we just
got Alex's test results back.

14:32.959 --> 14:34.917
Alex is stable right now,

14:34.961 --> 14:38.181
but the scan did confirm that
he is bleeding into his brain.

14:40.096 --> 14:41.924
And the intracranial pressure
is great enough

14:41.968 --> 14:44.884
that he needs
immediate surgical evacuation.

14:44.927 --> 14:46.059
- Oh, my God.

14:46.102 --> 14:48.061
- Wait, wait, wait.
How'd this happen?

14:48.104 --> 14:50.150
- Well, his test results
came back positive

14:50.193 --> 14:53.327
for a bleeding disorder called
Von Willebrand disease.

14:53.370 --> 14:56.852
So the impact from a small toy
could've caused a bleed

14:56.896 --> 14:59.289
that his body
just wasn't able to stop.

15:00.203 --> 15:01.770
- I--I know this is a lot,

15:01.813 --> 15:03.772
but Dr. Abrams
will be doing the surgery,

15:03.815 --> 15:05.252
and he's our very best.

15:05.295 --> 15:06.949
The procedure
shouldn't be that long.

15:06.993 --> 15:09.169
I'll be here for status updates
or if you have any questions.

15:09.212 --> 15:11.780
- And if we have your consent,

15:11.823 --> 15:12.999
we could get started
right away.

15:13.042 --> 15:14.174
- Sure.
- Yeah, of course.

15:14.217 --> 15:15.392
Whatever you need.
- Okay.

15:15.436 --> 15:16.785
So why don't I take you
somewhere

15:16.828 --> 15:17.960
that's more comfortable
to wait?

15:18.004 --> 15:20.223
- Um, Ryan.
Hey, buddy.

15:20.267 --> 15:21.311
Come on, buddy.
We're gonna take

15:21.355 --> 15:22.965
a little walk, all right?

15:23.009 --> 15:29.972
â™ª

15:33.236 --> 15:34.846
[all talking briefly]

15:37.458 --> 15:39.242
- Hey, I saw
Eleanor's oxygenation

15:39.286 --> 15:40.809
and cardiac output are down.

15:40.852 --> 15:42.158
Have you gotten her labs
back yet?

15:42.202 --> 15:43.986
- Yeah; they don't show much.
Mild infiltrates

15:44.030 --> 15:46.032
on her chest X-ray
and some eosinophilia.

15:46.075 --> 15:47.903
Still don't know
what's going on.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.687
- I'm a little concerned.

15:49.731 --> 15:51.298
One of her fingers and two
of her toes are going cold.

15:51.341 --> 15:52.995
- Oh, could just be
a vasospasm.

15:53.039 --> 15:55.215
- That could be, but--

15:55.258 --> 15:57.347
look, the major drawback
to any arterial line,

15:57.391 --> 15:59.175
including the Vas-COM,
is the potential

15:59.219 --> 16:00.263
for thrombus formation.

16:00.307 --> 16:01.743
So I think we should
pull it out.

16:01.786 --> 16:03.440
- Pull it out?

16:03.484 --> 16:05.747
I mean, thromboembolization
in arterial lines

16:05.790 --> 16:07.444
is extremely rare,
and it almost never occurs

16:07.488 --> 16:09.794
this quickly.
- I understand.

16:09.838 --> 16:11.361
I just think we should err
on the side of safety.

16:13.059 --> 16:14.538
What?

16:14.582 --> 16:18.325
- Is something going on?
It's getting us great numbers.

16:18.368 --> 16:20.022
Keeping Eleanor's meds titrated

16:20.066 --> 16:22.024
and her pressure
and heart rate optimized.

16:22.068 --> 16:23.373
Without it, we'd just be
shooting in the dark.

16:23.417 --> 16:25.158
- I know.
I just want to make sure

16:25.201 --> 16:28.161
we're using it appropriately.
- I think we are.

16:28.204 --> 16:30.206
Let's just give it
a little more time.

16:30.250 --> 16:33.209
[uneasy music]

16:33.253 --> 16:36.038
â™ª

16:36.082 --> 16:38.301
- Dr. Archer.
- Yeah.

16:38.345 --> 16:40.042
- What the hell
happened back there?

16:40.086 --> 16:41.130
- What?

16:41.174 --> 16:43.045
- Giving in to Dr. Blake
like that.

16:44.264 --> 16:46.962
- The surgery was a success,
and if you'll excuse me,

16:47.006 --> 16:48.485
I have an ED to run.

16:48.529 --> 16:50.357
- Hold on, Dean.

16:50.400 --> 16:52.141
You know,
with that kind of injury,

16:52.185 --> 16:54.056
keeping her open
is the right thing to do.

16:54.100 --> 16:56.363
- Dr. Blake's reasoning
was medically sound.

16:56.406 --> 16:58.539
I mean, I could argue it
either way.

16:58.582 --> 17:00.193
- Oh, come on!
- Crockett...

17:00.236 --> 17:03.065
hospital politics
is a lot like the military.

17:03.109 --> 17:05.067
You put in your time.
You do as your told.

17:05.111 --> 17:08.201
And eventually you can rise up
to become a Dr. Blake, too.

17:08.244 --> 17:15.208
â™ª

17:15.251 --> 17:18.211
- Hey, buddy.
This is my friend, Dr. Charles.

17:18.254 --> 17:19.734
- Hey, Alex.

17:19.777 --> 17:21.214
- We just came to check in
on you before your surgery,

17:21.257 --> 17:22.867
see if you had any questions.

17:23.955 --> 17:25.870
- Is this gonna hurt?
- No, no.

17:25.914 --> 17:27.046
They're gonna give you
some medicine.

17:27.089 --> 17:28.090
It's gonna put you
right to sleep.

17:28.134 --> 17:29.309
You won't feel a thing.

17:29.352 --> 17:32.225
- Even when they open my head?

17:32.268 --> 17:34.444
- Next thing you know,
you're just gonna

17:34.488 --> 17:36.925
wake up in recovery.
We promise.

17:37.969 --> 17:38.970
- Okay.

17:41.147 --> 17:42.452
- Anything else on your mind?

17:42.496 --> 17:44.889
- No.

17:49.851 --> 17:53.159
It's just,
when they look inside my head,

17:53.202 --> 17:55.248
will they see my secrets?

17:56.988 --> 17:59.426
- Uh, I don't think so.

17:59.469 --> 18:02.559
But if there is something
on your mind,

18:02.603 --> 18:06.215
a lot of kids tell me that
it's just better to get it out.

18:08.174 --> 18:10.132
- This wasn't Ryan's fault.

18:10.176 --> 18:12.178
- Oh, don't worry about that.
Ryan's not in any trouble.

18:12.221 --> 18:14.093
- No, I made him do it.

18:15.616 --> 18:18.619
I made fun of him,
and I know if I did it enough,

18:18.662 --> 18:21.230
then he'd get really mad
and hit me.

18:23.189 --> 18:25.016
- Yeah?

18:25.060 --> 18:26.453
Why would you want him
to hit you?

18:28.150 --> 18:31.371
- Because...

18:31.414 --> 18:32.589
- Because?

18:34.461 --> 18:36.332
If you got hurt, maybe

18:36.376 --> 18:38.291
Mom and Dad pay
a little more attention to you?

18:41.511 --> 18:43.513
- It was stupid.
I shouldn't have done it.

18:43.557 --> 18:45.515
- Hey, it's okay.

18:47.996 --> 18:50.477
Let's get you taken care of.
All right?

18:52.261 --> 18:55.046
- Alex, it's gonna be okay,
buddy.

18:55.090 --> 18:57.353
You're gonna be fine.
We'll see you in a bit.

18:59.964 --> 19:02.489
- [sighs] Man, listen,
I deal with a lot of sick kids,

19:02.532 --> 19:04.186
but what do you do for this?

19:04.230 --> 19:07.494
- So... kid with ADHD,
control issues, right?

19:07.537 --> 19:09.931
Random outbursts.
- True.

19:09.974 --> 19:13.978
- Yeah, but Alex knew he could
only get Ryan to lash out

19:14.022 --> 19:16.198
if he backed him into a corner.
That's not random.

19:16.242 --> 19:18.505
- So, what are we looking at
if this isn't ADHD?

19:18.548 --> 19:20.898
- I think maybe
an anxiety disorder.

19:20.942 --> 19:23.074
- Oh, another misdiagnosis.
Second in a week.

19:23.118 --> 19:25.033
- And if I'm right,
that misdiagnosis

19:25.076 --> 19:27.166
is causing this family
a lot of problems.

19:30.386 --> 19:31.996
[alarm beeping]
- You have to come quick.

19:32.040 --> 19:34.085
Something's wrong with Ellie.

19:34.129 --> 19:36.087
[dramatic music]

19:36.131 --> 19:38.481
[monitor beeping]

19:38.525 --> 19:41.223
- Eleanor, can you hear me?
- Yeah.

19:41.267 --> 19:44.357
- Okay.
- Squeeze my hand.

19:44.400 --> 19:50.101
â™ª

19:50.145 --> 19:52.278
- What's happening?
Why's she like this?

19:52.321 --> 19:54.236
- She had a TIA,
a mini-stroke.

19:54.280 --> 19:56.064
Start her on aspirin
and clopidogrel

19:56.107 --> 19:57.326
and call for an MRI
of her head.

19:57.370 --> 19:59.241
- A stroke?
What--what? Why?

19:59.285 --> 20:01.243
- 'Cause she's forming thrombi.
They're blood clots

20:01.287 --> 20:02.984
in her vessels, and one's
travelled to her brain.

20:03.027 --> 20:04.333
- Oh, my God.

20:04.377 --> 20:07.075
â™ª

20:07.118 --> 20:09.251
- Get a suture kit.
We have to pull the Vas out.

20:09.295 --> 20:11.253
- I'll call Dr. Hammer.
Excuse me, Mr. Halt.

20:11.297 --> 20:12.559
She's up in radiology.
- No, no, no.

20:12.602 --> 20:13.734
Every minute that passes

20:13.777 --> 20:15.257
increases her risk
of a major stroke.

20:15.301 --> 20:16.519
We have to pull it right now.

20:16.563 --> 20:22.569
â™ª

20:29.924 --> 20:30.316
.

20:30.359 --> 20:32.753
- Hey, you okay?

20:34.798 --> 20:37.323
- No.
I screwed everything up today.

20:39.934 --> 20:42.458
- I saw Alex's notes.

20:42.502 --> 20:44.678
Von Willebrand disease?
You couldn't have known.

20:44.721 --> 20:46.767
- I could've ordered
those labs earlier.

20:46.810 --> 20:47.985
- But it doesn't matter.

20:48.029 --> 20:49.248
The outcome still
would've been the same.

20:50.727 --> 20:52.599
Look, you're always gonna wish
that you could've done

20:52.642 --> 20:54.296
something earlier.

20:54.340 --> 20:55.689
It's part
of being a good doctor.

20:55.732 --> 20:57.386
- Alex is in surgery, Maggie.

20:57.430 --> 20:59.736
He's bleeding into his brain.

20:59.780 --> 21:01.651
- Which isn't your fault.

21:07.831 --> 21:12.662
â™ª

21:12.706 --> 21:15.317
- You pulled
my patient's Vas-COM?

21:21.062 --> 21:22.542
- She had a TIA.

21:22.585 --> 21:23.804
The Vas-COM was
most likely the source.

21:23.847 --> 21:25.762
- You don't know that.
Could've been lupus,

21:25.806 --> 21:27.721
endocarditis, even leukemia.

21:27.764 --> 21:29.679
And now we have no way
to monitor her.

21:29.723 --> 21:31.420
- She could've had
another stroke at any minute.

21:31.464 --> 21:32.421
What--what was
I supposed to do?

21:32.465 --> 21:34.597
- She's my patient, Will.

21:34.641 --> 21:36.077
You at least
should've asked me.

21:36.120 --> 21:37.513
- By the time
you got down here--

21:37.557 --> 21:38.949
I'm not taking that chance.
- No, you were afraid

21:38.993 --> 21:40.560
that I would disagree
and that I'd stop you.

21:40.603 --> 21:41.778
- No.

21:41.822 --> 21:42.953
- It's the same old Will
from med school,

21:42.997 --> 21:44.651
always thinking
that you know better.

21:44.694 --> 21:47.306
- Stevie, that's not
what this was about.

21:47.349 --> 21:49.046
- You tell yourself that.

21:49.090 --> 21:55.575
â™ª

21:55.618 --> 21:56.967
- Hi.

21:57.011 --> 21:58.404
I don't know if you remember me
from this morning.

21:58.447 --> 22:00.710
I'm the surgeon on your case,
Dr. Marcel.

22:00.754 --> 22:01.929
How you feeling?

22:01.972 --> 22:04.584
- Like I got hit by a car.

22:04.627 --> 22:06.629
- Well, you did
just have major surgery,

22:06.673 --> 22:08.109
but, uh, it went well,

22:08.152 --> 22:11.591
and I imagine you will feel
a little better each day.

22:11.634 --> 22:13.593
- Here you go.

22:13.636 --> 22:16.335
Dr. Blake said to go slow.
- Thanks, Dina.

22:16.378 --> 22:20.077
- Ice chips.
My mom is in love with them.

22:20.121 --> 22:21.818
Frankly, I think they're
just as much

22:21.862 --> 22:24.604
an aspiration risk as liquids.
- Aspiration risk?

22:24.647 --> 22:26.562
What, are you
a--you a doctor, too?

22:26.606 --> 22:28.869
- Made it halfway through
a third year of med school.

22:28.912 --> 22:30.436
- Oh, okay.

22:30.479 --> 22:33.134
- Realized I was doing it
for my mom, not for me.

22:33.177 --> 22:34.396
- Oh.

22:34.440 --> 22:36.355
- I'm assuming
you've met her by now?

22:37.704 --> 22:39.967
- Made her acquaintance, yeah.

22:40.010 --> 22:42.056
- She try to scrub in?

22:42.099 --> 22:44.014
- How'd you guess?
- [groans]

22:44.058 --> 22:45.451
I know my mom.
- [laughs]

22:45.494 --> 22:47.017
- She didn't talk to me
for six months

22:47.061 --> 22:50.412
after I quit med school.
- Wow, that's rough.

22:50.456 --> 22:51.761
- No.

22:51.805 --> 22:54.416
The day I took control
of my life?

22:54.460 --> 22:56.375
Best move I ever made.

22:59.465 --> 23:01.554
- Anyway, I should
let you get some rest.

23:01.597 --> 23:06.907
Um, enjoy your ice chips,
and I'll check back later.

23:06.950 --> 23:10.476
So wait, what did you
end up doing after med school?

23:10.519 --> 23:13.000
- A malpractice lawyer.
- Medical?

23:14.741 --> 23:17.526
Your mom must be very proud.
- [laughs]

23:21.574 --> 23:23.532
- Mr. and Mrs. Miller,
I have an update for you.

23:26.535 --> 23:27.536
- Be right back, buddy.

23:29.930 --> 23:32.106
- So, look, they're--they're
just finishing up

23:32.149 --> 23:33.586
in surgery now.

23:33.629 --> 23:36.458
All indications are that
the procedure was a success.

23:36.502 --> 23:38.068
And Alex is doing great.

23:38.112 --> 23:41.202
- Oh, my God, really?
Thank you so much.

23:41.245 --> 23:44.031
Listen, Dr. Scott and I
talked to Alex

23:44.074 --> 23:45.685
before the procedure today.

23:45.728 --> 23:49.471
And I understand that you have
a lot on your plate right now,

23:49.515 --> 23:51.691
but I--I also think
it's important that I share

23:51.734 --> 23:53.040
this conversation with you.

23:53.083 --> 23:54.563
both: Okay.

23:54.607 --> 23:56.870
- So--so what
he told us is that

23:56.913 --> 23:59.699
he provoked Ryan
into this outburst today.

23:59.742 --> 24:00.961
He feels terrible.

24:01.004 --> 24:02.963
I think he is looking
for some attention.

24:03.006 --> 24:05.922
But where Ryan's concerned--
what this means to me

24:05.966 --> 24:08.664
is that it wasn't
an impulsive outburst.

24:08.708 --> 24:11.188
It wasn't--it wasn't random.

24:11.232 --> 24:15.497
And that and a couple other
things I've observed today

24:15.541 --> 24:17.717
are leading me to believe
it's very possible

24:17.760 --> 24:20.676
that--that your son has
been misdiagnosed with ADHD

24:20.720 --> 24:22.548
and that we were
probably looking

24:22.591 --> 24:24.724
at some kind
of anxiety disorder instead.

24:24.767 --> 24:25.899
- Wait, what are you
talking about?

24:25.942 --> 24:27.596
Look at him.
He can't sit still.

24:27.640 --> 24:30.251
- But Mr. Miller,
it's--it's the counting, right?

24:30.294 --> 24:31.644
The tapping.

24:31.687 --> 24:33.210
I think that
he's self-soothing

24:33.254 --> 24:35.735
to help him cope
with these feelings of anxiety.

24:35.778 --> 24:37.084
And when that stops working,

24:37.127 --> 24:39.173
I think he feels
backed into a corner,

24:39.216 --> 24:41.915
and then you have
a fight-or-flight situation.

24:41.958 --> 24:43.525
- Well, what
about the Adderall?

24:43.569 --> 24:44.787
His doctor said
that would help.

24:44.831 --> 24:48.617
- If he actually had ADHD,
it would be working.

24:48.661 --> 24:51.751
But it's not, right?
I think that in Ryan's case,

24:51.794 --> 24:53.274
it's actually working
against him

24:53.317 --> 24:55.755
and serving to only intensify
these feelings of anxiety

24:55.798 --> 24:57.278
to the point
where they're often,

24:57.321 --> 24:58.801
frankly, unbearable.

24:58.845 --> 25:00.760
- Dr. Charles,
man, look I--I--

25:00.803 --> 25:02.544
we appreciate everything
you're doing.

25:02.588 --> 25:04.938
Really, but please,
our son's in surgery.

25:04.981 --> 25:07.941
- I am sorry.
This is just not an ideal time

25:07.984 --> 25:10.030
to have this conversation.
But I just wouldn't

25:10.073 --> 25:11.640
be doing my job
if I didn't tell you

25:11.684 --> 25:13.947
how important I think
it would be to reassess Ryan

25:13.990 --> 25:16.558
and make sure that you are
looking at the right diagnosis

25:16.602 --> 25:19.126
for him, for his brother,
for all of you,

25:19.169 --> 25:21.955
for your whole family.
- No, Dr. Charles, it's just--

25:21.998 --> 25:24.566
it's just been a long day.

25:24.610 --> 25:26.699
- Listen, I am going
to check back with you

25:26.742 --> 25:27.874
when Alex wakes up, okay?

25:27.917 --> 25:30.050
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

25:35.142 --> 25:37.884
- I should've consulted you
before pulling the Vas-COM.

25:37.927 --> 25:40.669
It wasn't my place.
I'm sorry.

25:40.713 --> 25:42.149
And besides, you were right.

25:42.192 --> 25:44.630
She's getting worse and
still having embolic events.

25:44.673 --> 25:46.109
So it wasn't
the Vas-COM after all.

25:46.153 --> 25:48.634
- Clearly,
but I've gone through

25:48.677 --> 25:50.679
every clotting disorder,
and none of it fits.

25:50.723 --> 25:53.203
- Is it possible
we're looking at this wrong?

25:53.247 --> 25:55.597
That she doesn't even have
a clotting disorder?

25:55.641 --> 25:59.906
- Of course.
It's just so little to go on.

25:59.949 --> 26:02.648
I mean, history of asthma,
eosinophils,

26:02.691 --> 26:03.997
and left-sided
lung infiltrates.

26:04.040 --> 26:05.085
- Left?

26:05.128 --> 26:06.652
I thought
they were on the right.

26:06.695 --> 26:09.568
- Seriously, Will?
- No, no, wait.

26:09.611 --> 26:11.744
The X-ray from this morning
had them on the left.

26:11.787 --> 26:13.354
But look...

26:13.397 --> 26:15.574
The one from this afternoon
shows they moved to the right.

26:17.706 --> 26:19.665
- Migratory infiltrates.

26:22.189 --> 26:25.061
Could this be vasculitis?
Churg-Strauss?

26:25.105 --> 26:26.672
- I mean maybe.
She could've moved

26:26.715 --> 26:29.065
from the asthmatic stage
into the vascular stage today.

26:29.109 --> 26:32.155
- It's a long shot,
but it's possible.

26:32.199 --> 26:34.201
- If we're right,
her organs could start

26:34.244 --> 26:36.116
to shut down at any moment.

26:36.159 --> 26:37.770
- I'll start her on prednisone
and azathioprine

26:37.813 --> 26:39.685
and set her up
for a diagnostic lung biopsy.

26:39.728 --> 26:41.774
- Dr. Hammer, Dr. Halstead,
you need to come.

26:41.817 --> 26:43.036
Eleanor's getting worse.

26:49.433 --> 26:49.782
.

26:49.825 --> 26:52.219
- I don't like
these QRS complexes.

26:52.262 --> 26:54.177
- Eleanor, do you feel any pain
in your chest or arm?

26:54.221 --> 26:56.963
- It feels tight.
- Oh, God, Ellie.

26:57.006 --> 26:58.007
- Why don't you come here?

26:58.051 --> 26:59.792
[beeping]

26:59.835 --> 27:01.228
- She's going into v-tach.
- I'll get the paddles.

27:01.271 --> 27:03.578
- No, no, Ellie.
- Wait.

27:03.622 --> 27:06.320
If this is Churg-Strauss,
this could be a tamponade.

27:06.363 --> 27:07.930
We need to aspirate the fluid.

27:07.974 --> 27:09.410
- I know, but if we're wrong,

27:09.453 --> 27:11.412
we won't have time
to cardiovert.

27:11.455 --> 27:13.893
- I think we're right
about this.

27:13.936 --> 27:15.590
- I do, too.

27:15.634 --> 27:18.854
18 gauge on a syringe.
- 18 gauge.

27:18.898 --> 27:21.074
[beeping]

27:21.117 --> 27:23.859
- Ron, there's fluid
around Eleanor's heart.

27:23.903 --> 27:25.818
They need to drain it.

27:25.861 --> 27:27.471
[beeping]

27:27.515 --> 27:29.430
- Nothing.

27:35.305 --> 27:37.830
Got it.

27:37.873 --> 27:40.049
- Sinus rhythm.

27:40.093 --> 27:42.922
- Eleanor, can you hear me?

27:42.965 --> 27:44.967
- Uh-huh.
- Oh, thank God.

27:45.011 --> 27:46.403
- Call IR.
Tell them we're coming up

27:46.447 --> 27:49.276
for a drain and a lung biopsy.
- You got it.

27:50.233 --> 27:51.887
- Good job.

27:58.285 --> 28:00.330
- Hey. How you feeling?

28:01.462 --> 28:04.291
- Okay.
- Good.

28:05.988 --> 28:07.511
Surgery went well.

28:10.297 --> 28:12.995
In fact, the neurosurgeon said

28:13.039 --> 28:14.518
that you had
the best-looking brain

28:14.562 --> 28:16.346
he's seen in quite a while.

28:17.870 --> 28:20.176
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

28:20.220 --> 28:23.527
Told your parents,
but they weren't surprised.

28:23.571 --> 28:26.226
Said they always knew
you had a great brain.

28:27.618 --> 28:29.185
- They said that?

28:31.405 --> 28:34.887
- Yeah, they did.

28:38.020 --> 28:41.154
You know, Alex,
kids with great brains--

28:41.197 --> 28:42.982
they don't always get
the most attention,

28:43.025 --> 28:45.419
but... people notice.

28:51.947 --> 28:53.340
- What's going on?

28:53.383 --> 28:56.517
- O2 sats are 91.
BP's down to 83/50.

28:56.560 --> 28:58.519
- Drains are full.

28:58.562 --> 29:00.956
- [groans]
- Belly's firm.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.392
Okay, etomidate and sux,
then transduce

29:02.436 --> 29:03.654
to a bladder pressure.
Let's go.

29:03.698 --> 29:05.265
Hey, Avery, look at me.

29:05.308 --> 29:07.006
You're re-bleeding
into your abdomen.

29:07.049 --> 29:09.530
I need to intubate and take you
back to the OR, okay?

29:09.573 --> 29:12.359
- [groans]

29:12.402 --> 29:13.577
- What happened?

29:13.621 --> 29:14.970
- Abdominal compartment
syndrome.

29:15.014 --> 29:17.059
We're going back to the OR.
- No, no need.

29:17.103 --> 29:19.279
You can use a cordis catheter
and decompress here.

29:19.322 --> 29:21.020
- There's too much blood.
We don't have enough time.

29:21.063 --> 29:22.543
I'm in. Bag her.

29:22.586 --> 29:24.371
- And if you open her up,
there'll be too much swelling,

29:24.414 --> 29:26.199
and you'll never
be able to close.

29:26.242 --> 29:27.374
- Get the cordis.

29:29.506 --> 29:31.552
- Dr. Marcel,
bladder pressure's 35.

29:31.595 --> 29:35.556
[beeping]
- It's too high.

29:35.599 --> 29:37.297
We need to open her up
to release the pressure.

29:37.340 --> 29:38.385
Get me a 10 blade.

29:38.428 --> 29:39.560
- Dr. Marcel,
I already told you--

29:39.603 --> 29:42.215
- Back off, Dr. Blake.
Here we go. Ready?

29:42.258 --> 29:46.001
[beeping]

29:46.045 --> 29:52.138
â™ª

29:53.487 --> 29:57.578
- Sats are up to 96
and BP's 112/83.

29:57.621 --> 29:59.580
She's stable.

29:59.623 --> 30:01.669
- All right,
get her up to the OR.

30:01.712 --> 30:03.236
â™ª

30:03.279 --> 30:04.585
- Make sure
you get her swelling down.

30:04.628 --> 30:06.108
â™ª

30:06.152 --> 30:08.241
You're gonna need to close
her up as soon as possible.

30:08.284 --> 30:15.291
â™ª

30:27.738 --> 30:30.089
- How is Alex?

30:30.132 --> 30:33.135
- Um, his surgery just ended.

30:33.179 --> 30:34.571
He's doing really well.

30:34.615 --> 30:36.747
- Alex probably hates me.

30:36.791 --> 30:39.185
I want to tell him
I'm really, really sorry.

30:39.228 --> 30:40.534
- You'll be able
to see him soon.

30:40.577 --> 30:43.450
And then you can tell him.
- Can I see him now?

30:44.625 --> 30:47.323
- I'm not supposed to let you
until he's in his room.

30:47.367 --> 30:49.151
- Please?

30:51.327 --> 30:54.113
- Okay, maybe we could
just take a quick peek.

30:54.156 --> 30:56.071
If it's okay with your parents.

30:56.115 --> 30:57.768
- Mom, can I go
with the doctor?

30:57.812 --> 30:59.379
- Yeah, honey.

30:59.422 --> 31:01.685
- Okey doke, let's go.

31:06.299 --> 31:07.691
So he's still a little sleepy,

31:07.735 --> 31:09.693
so we're just gonna give him
a quick wave hi, okay?

31:15.351 --> 31:17.353
- That's not Alex.

31:17.397 --> 31:18.615
- It's okay.

31:18.659 --> 31:20.313
He's just
a little bandaged from surgery.

31:20.356 --> 31:22.489
- I didn't do that.
- No, of course you didn't.

31:22.532 --> 31:24.186
- I didn't mean to.
No, I'm sorry.

31:24.230 --> 31:25.187
I'm sorry.
- Hey, hey, Ryan,

31:25.231 --> 31:26.406
Ryan, Ryan, it's okay.

31:26.449 --> 31:27.755
Listen to me. Listen to me.
Ryan, look,

31:27.798 --> 31:29.017
you didn't do anything wrong.
- Stop it.

31:29.061 --> 31:30.149
- Ryan!

31:31.715 --> 31:34.196
Ryan! Ryan!

31:34.240 --> 31:41.247
â™ª

31:50.517 --> 31:52.475
I'm so sorry.
This is all my fault.

31:52.519 --> 31:53.650
- The security camera
picked him up.

31:53.694 --> 31:54.869
We're okay.

31:54.913 --> 31:57.176
- Still, I just
can't apologize enough.

31:57.219 --> 31:58.873
Maybe I should talk
to his parents or--

31:58.917 --> 32:00.266
- You know what?

32:00.309 --> 32:01.615
I think it's probably better
if I handle this.

32:01.658 --> 32:03.530
Listen, Vanessa,
not your fault.

32:03.573 --> 32:04.748
Okay?

32:04.792 --> 32:06.533
You were trying to help.

32:06.576 --> 32:09.449
â™ª

32:09.492 --> 32:11.190
- Ryan, your brother
just had surgery.

32:11.233 --> 32:14.889
That's why he looks like that.
He's gonna be fine, buddy.

32:14.933 --> 32:17.065
Now, can you please come out?

32:18.632 --> 32:19.850
- Please, Ryan?

32:19.894 --> 32:25.117
â™ª

32:25.160 --> 32:27.423
- Mind if I give it a try?
- Yes.

32:29.295 --> 32:30.600
- Hey, Ryan.

32:34.256 --> 32:35.431
You know what?

32:36.693 --> 32:39.609
I don't think that you wanted
to hurt your brother today.

32:41.916 --> 32:44.179
I think the only reason
you threw that toy today

32:44.223 --> 32:47.226
was because you didn't know
what else to do.

32:48.749 --> 32:50.272
- I got so mad.

32:52.274 --> 32:54.798
- 'Cause those feelings,
they just...

32:54.842 --> 32:57.801
They just keep building
and building.

32:59.629 --> 33:01.501
- Uh-huh.
I can't stop them.

33:01.544 --> 33:03.546
And I'm always
getting in trouble.

33:07.550 --> 33:09.552
- What if I told you
that I didn't think that

33:09.596 --> 33:13.252
that was your fault?
- That's not what people say.

33:13.295 --> 33:15.254
They're always telling me
to reset.

33:15.297 --> 33:17.473
- Well, you know what?
I don't think it's your fault.

33:19.432 --> 33:22.783
Not only that, you know
those--those feeling you get?

33:24.176 --> 33:25.960
I get them, too.

33:26.004 --> 33:27.744
- You do?
- Oh, yeah.

33:27.788 --> 33:30.269
Everybody does.

33:30.312 --> 33:35.448
And one of the things that
really helps me when I get them

33:35.491 --> 33:37.493
is, actually,
to talk about them.

33:38.842 --> 33:41.628
You know, there's
this weird magic when you--

33:41.671 --> 33:43.630
when you get them out.

33:43.673 --> 33:47.634
They just--they just don't
seem to bother you as much.

33:48.678 --> 33:50.289
- Really?
- Yeah.

33:51.551 --> 33:55.729
And I guarantee you,
whatever feeling you're having

33:55.772 --> 33:58.210
there are people in your life--

33:58.253 --> 34:01.778
they want to hear about it.
I mean, your mom and dad...

34:01.822 --> 34:04.868
They would really want
to hear about them.

34:04.912 --> 34:07.784
- They would?
- Of course we would, honey.

34:10.048 --> 34:12.267
- And you won't think
that I'm bad?

34:13.312 --> 34:15.662
- Ryan,
we never think you're bad.

34:15.705 --> 34:22.712
â™ª

34:30.068 --> 34:33.332
- I got you.

34:33.375 --> 34:40.382
â™ª

34:41.731 --> 34:43.907
- You really don't think
this is ADHD?

34:44.691 --> 34:45.822
- I don't think it is.

34:48.564 --> 34:52.220
- So this Adderall
isn't helping?

34:52.264 --> 34:54.483
- I think it's
actually making it worse.

34:54.527 --> 35:01.534
â™ª

35:09.933 --> 35:10.108
.

35:10.151 --> 35:12.110
- Hey, I just saw
Eleanor's biopsy results.

35:12.153 --> 35:15.025
Churg-Strauss.

35:15.069 --> 35:18.159
- Hey, maybe we work well
together after all.

35:18.203 --> 35:20.727
- Maybe we do.

35:20.770 --> 35:22.468
I'll see you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

35:22.511 --> 35:25.732
Oh, I made a few calls.

35:25.775 --> 35:30.302
It was definitely Mandelbrot.
[laughter]

35:30.345 --> 35:32.869
Bye.

35:32.913 --> 35:34.175
- Bye.

35:34.219 --> 35:37.483
- Will, I just met Eleanor.

35:37.526 --> 35:41.139
Churg-Strauss,
one in a million.

35:41.182 --> 35:42.792
- Yeah.

35:42.836 --> 35:44.272
- Though I did see you had
to pull her Vas-COM.

35:44.316 --> 35:46.448
- Yeah, I hated to do it.

35:46.492 --> 35:48.058
Uh, but she
was throwing emboli,

35:48.102 --> 35:49.582
had some
cold fingers and toes--

35:49.625 --> 35:51.105
- Hey, hey, Will, you
absolutely did the right thing.

35:51.149 --> 35:52.628
The last thing we need
is for the Vas-COM

35:52.672 --> 35:54.500
to be used inappropriately
and then it gets a bad rap.

35:54.543 --> 35:56.806
- That--that's what I thought,
too.

35:56.850 --> 35:59.200
- Now that she's stable,
however, it did seem

35:59.244 --> 36:01.202
medically warranted to get
her on better monitoring again,

36:01.246 --> 36:03.030
so I just put in
another Vas-COM.

36:03.073 --> 36:04.249
â™ª

36:04.292 --> 36:05.641
- Okay.

36:05.685 --> 36:07.948
- Anyway, I'm glad you're
coming to the conference.

36:07.991 --> 36:10.211
- Yeah, same here.

36:10.255 --> 36:12.387
- Hey, maybe, um,
if you get there early.

36:12.431 --> 36:13.388
we could have a drink?

36:13.432 --> 36:16.174
- Sure.

36:16.217 --> 36:23.181
â™ª

36:31.841 --> 36:34.279
- [groans]
So what do you think?

36:36.324 --> 36:37.934
- What do I think?

36:37.978 --> 36:42.417
Um, I think that they have made
a crucial breakthrough.

36:42.461 --> 36:44.071
And now they got
some work to do.

36:45.638 --> 36:47.814
- Yeah, you know,
it's something--

36:47.857 --> 36:50.251
how easy it is,
even in a loving family,

36:50.295 --> 36:52.166
to feel so unseen.

36:52.210 --> 36:53.298
- Huh?

36:55.865 --> 36:58.999
- I guess I didn't always
appreciate how good I had it.

36:59.042 --> 37:05.048
â™ª

37:11.446 --> 37:15.320
- Your numbers look good.
And your drains are clear.

37:18.061 --> 37:19.062
- [groans]

37:22.022 --> 37:24.329
- So, if you get thirsty,

37:24.372 --> 37:27.027
you can just ask the nurses
for some ice chips.

37:34.948 --> 37:36.558
- Ice chips.

37:38.256 --> 37:40.345
- [laughs]

37:48.527 --> 37:50.920
- Finally going to
get some sleep?

37:50.964 --> 37:53.445
- Boards aren't going to study
for themselves.

37:54.533 --> 37:56.012
- Believe me,
a nap wouldn't hurt.

37:58.363 --> 38:00.495
Anyway, I'm going to run
this boy's Adderall

38:00.539 --> 38:03.890
over to the pharmacy,
then I'm out of here.

38:07.415 --> 38:10.549
- All right, well, um,
see you tomorrow.

38:11.593 --> 38:13.334
- Hey, Vanessa,

38:13.378 --> 38:15.597
I know how tough
internship can be.

38:15.641 --> 38:18.600
But everyone here already sees
what a good doctor you are.

38:20.994 --> 38:22.430
- Thanks, Maggie.

38:24.693 --> 38:26.086
- Yeah.

38:28.175 --> 38:29.350
- Hey, Mike.
- Hey, Phil.

38:29.394 --> 38:33.049
â™ª

38:33.093 --> 38:34.355
- Hey, Dad.

38:34.399 --> 38:36.575
- Hey, Dylan,
what are you doing here?

38:36.618 --> 38:39.969
- Oh, you know, stopping by.
- Okay.

38:40.013 --> 38:41.144
- Italian beef?

38:42.145 --> 38:45.323
- Is that Al's?
Oh, come on.

38:45.366 --> 38:47.063
It's been a long time.
- I know.

38:47.107 --> 38:48.195
Ever since you
used to bring them

38:48.238 --> 38:49.370
to me every day
at medical school.

38:49.414 --> 38:51.329
- [laughs]

38:51.372 --> 38:53.113
Really, that was just so
I could get one, too.

38:53.156 --> 38:54.984
- [laughs]

38:55.028 --> 38:57.247
Here you go.
- Thank you.

38:57.291 --> 38:58.423
Mmm, mmm, mmm.
- Yeah.

39:01.295 --> 39:03.558
You know, um,

39:03.602 --> 39:07.127
just wanted to say
thank you, Dad.

39:08.433 --> 39:10.957
- For what?
Bringing you sandwiches?

39:12.045 --> 39:13.438
- No, no.

39:14.743 --> 39:16.528
For everything.

39:16.571 --> 39:23.578
â™ª

39:31.369 --> 39:32.761
- Okay, you know what, boy?

39:32.805 --> 39:34.241
How many times
I got to tell you

39:34.284 --> 39:36.199
you got to ask for
extra giardiniera over there?

39:36.243 --> 39:43.119
â™ª

39:43.163 --> 39:44.556
[phone dings]

39:52.041 --> 39:54.609
- Dr. Marcel, this is Enid,
from Dr. Blake's service.

39:54.653 --> 39:56.524
Dr. Blake has
a kidney transplant

39:56.568 --> 39:58.787
that she would
like you to scrub in on.

39:58.831 --> 40:00.485
Uh, please be here
in half an hour.

40:10.059 --> 40:11.757
- [sighs]
