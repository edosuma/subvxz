WEBVTT

00:04.704 --> 00:06.472
Walter:
<i>My name is walter o'brien.</i>

00:06.474 --> 00:10.709
<i>I have the fourth highest iq</i>
<i>ever recorded: 197.</i>

00:10.711 --> 00:12.544
<i>Einstein's was 160.</i>

00:12.546 --> 00:15.147
<i>When I was 11, the fbi</i>
<i>arrested me for hacking nasa</i>

00:15.149 --> 00:17.783
<i>To get their blueprints</i>
<i>for my bedroom wall.</i>

00:17.785 --> 00:19.785
<i>Now I run a team of geniuses,</i>

00:19.787 --> 00:21.453
<i>Tackling worldwide threats</i>

00:21.455 --> 00:22.688
<i>Only we can solve.</i>

00:22.690 --> 00:24.623
<i>Toby's our behaviorist.</i>

00:24.625 --> 00:26.458
Sylvester's a human calculator.

00:26.460 --> 00:28.627
<i>Happy, a mechanical prodigy.</i>

00:28.629 --> 00:31.163
<i>Agent cabe gallo's</i>
<i>our government handler.</i>

00:31.165 --> 00:33.332
<i>And paige?</i>
<i>Well, paige isn't like us.</i>

00:33.334 --> 00:35.667
<i>She's normal</i>
<i>and translates the world for us</i>

00:35.669 --> 00:38.370
<i>While we help her understand</i>
<i>her genius son.</i>

00:38.372 --> 00:40.339
<i>Together, we are scorpion.</i>

00:45.478 --> 00:47.780
Man:
Looks like we're about 15 miles

00:47.782 --> 00:50.249
Outside of pendleton.
Not a moment too soon.

00:50.251 --> 00:52.051
I got to waz again.

00:54.220 --> 00:57.423
Hey, what's this guy doing?

00:57.425 --> 00:59.792
Whoa, whoa. Whoa!
What the hell?!

00:59.794 --> 01:01.427
Out of the truck now!

01:01.429 --> 01:03.729
Get out!

01:03.731 --> 01:05.330
Please, don't shoot! Please!

01:21.748 --> 01:23.582
Take the rockets.

01:23.584 --> 01:26.151
Leave the bodies.

01:26.153 --> 01:28.554
Got it.

01:38.832 --> 01:40.466
Toby:
<i>Well, this is highly illegal.</i>

01:40.468 --> 01:42.134
I'm simply expediting things

01:42.136 --> 01:43.869
Through technological
intervention.

01:43.871 --> 01:46.171
You're hacking into a site
that charges for reservations

01:46.173 --> 01:48.140
To save the 20 bucks.
Nope.

01:48.142 --> 01:50.175
They were fully booked.

01:50.177 --> 01:51.810
Dinner for two at escala?

01:51.812 --> 01:53.745
One of the ten hottest
spots in town.

01:53.747 --> 01:56.515
Yes, walter, I would be
happy to dine with you.

01:56.517 --> 01:57.883
Oh, nice try.

01:57.885 --> 01:59.685
It's a business dinner.

01:59.687 --> 02:02.888
Need to go over some office
data entry protocol with paige.

02:02.890 --> 02:06.692
You are taking paige
to a top l.A. Eatery

02:06.694 --> 02:08.193
On valentine's day?

02:08.195 --> 02:11.263
Just one week after drew
signed a month-long contract

02:11.265 --> 02:12.464
To pitch in portland.

02:12.466 --> 02:13.866
How convenient.

02:13.868 --> 02:15.868
Is valentine's this weekend?

02:15.870 --> 02:17.703
I had no idea.
Should I get the extinguisher?

02:17.705 --> 02:19.671
'cause your pants
are on fire, liar, liar.

02:19.673 --> 02:21.807
You don't think paige
notices the timing?

02:21.809 --> 02:24.443
It is a business meeting.

02:24.445 --> 02:27.779
Valentine's is a scam created
by the greeting card industry.

02:27.781 --> 02:29.214
The only reason why
I picked that place is

02:29.216 --> 02:30.849
Because paige mentioned it.

02:30.851 --> 02:32.784
The cherry on top
of the denial sundae.

02:32.786 --> 02:35.754
You're being attentive
to her wants.

02:35.756 --> 02:36.889
Paige:
Good morning, guys.

02:36.891 --> 02:38.624
Paige.
Ms. Dineen.

02:38.626 --> 02:39.791
I brought donuts.

02:39.793 --> 02:42.928
Oh, thank you.

02:44.731 --> 02:46.932
It's a date!
Grow up.

02:46.934 --> 02:49.301
For dessert, you should order
<i>phoenix dactylifera.</i>

02:49.303 --> 02:50.736
Why? Because that's
the botanical name for dates?

02:50.738 --> 02:51.637
Yup.

02:51.639 --> 02:53.305
This conversation's over.

02:55.909 --> 02:57.242
What you got there, pal?

02:57.244 --> 02:59.578
Nada.

02:59.580 --> 03:01.446
Cabe:
Hope you're caffeinated!

03:01.448 --> 03:03.248
'cause it's time
to punch the clock.

03:03.250 --> 03:05.918
Last night a weapons
manufacturer was ambushed.

03:05.920 --> 03:08.253
A shipment of high-tech,

03:08.255 --> 03:11.390
Lightweight, shoulder-launch
rockets were stolen.

03:11.392 --> 03:14.793
Homeland has received intel

03:14.795 --> 03:16.495
That an arms dealer,
who we only know as christoph,

03:16.497 --> 03:17.863
Is behind it.

03:17.865 --> 03:19.565
He's never been
photographed or I.D.'d.

03:19.567 --> 03:22.901
But he's known to sell across
the globe to rwanda and somalia

03:22.903 --> 03:24.303
Any weapon to suit
your genocide needs, huh?

03:24.305 --> 03:25.504
This is a bad, bad man.

03:25.506 --> 03:27.439
Yes, and he's stolen
a very bad piece

03:27.441 --> 03:28.840
Of experimental hardware.

03:28.842 --> 03:30.676
These rockets have
a range nine times

03:30.678 --> 03:31.843
The standard with
laser guidance

03:31.845 --> 03:33.979
Technology that makes
them impossible

03:33.981 --> 03:35.480
To shake once they
lock on target.

03:35.482 --> 03:37.816
All in the size of
a louisville slugger.

03:37.818 --> 03:39.518
So, if the rockets
were stolen last night,

03:39.520 --> 03:40.752
They're already on the move.

03:40.754 --> 03:41.954
Correct, but we've
traced them to the port

03:41.956 --> 03:43.589
Of long beach through
satellite footage.

03:43.591 --> 03:46.425
So, you want us to identify
the shipping container?

03:46.427 --> 03:47.926
There is no shipping container.

03:47.928 --> 03:49.528
Apparently christoph is using

03:49.530 --> 03:51.797
A luxury cruise line
as transport.

03:51.799 --> 03:53.232
He's one of 100 passengers.

03:53.234 --> 03:55.701
The one percent
of the one percent.

03:55.703 --> 03:57.869
Ride in style,
avoid airport security.

03:57.871 --> 03:59.705
I want to be rich just once.

03:59.707 --> 04:01.740
Stop gambling.
Stop judging.

04:01.742 --> 04:02.841
Paige:
So, if you think you know

04:02.843 --> 04:04.843
The boat he's using,
go take him down.

04:04.845 --> 04:08.714
We're looking for a bigger fish.
Not that simple.

04:08.716 --> 04:10.515
Homeland wants us to hack into

04:10.517 --> 04:12.451
The guidance system
of each munition,

04:12.453 --> 04:15.687
And plant gps tracking software
so that we can find out

04:15.689 --> 04:17.289
Who christoph sells them to.

04:17.291 --> 04:18.924
So, there's no time to waste.

04:18.926 --> 04:20.292
Now...

04:20.294 --> 04:23.395
Who's up for a little
james bond action?

04:23.397 --> 04:24.563
Sweet.

04:24.565 --> 04:25.564
Cool.

04:25.566 --> 04:26.565
Not me.

04:26.567 --> 04:27.566
Let's do it.

04:27.568 --> 04:29.301
Now, I just have to save it

04:29.303 --> 04:32.738
With the virus I embedded and...

04:32.740 --> 04:33.939
Done! How long?

04:33.941 --> 04:36.008
14 minutes and 32 seconds.

04:36.010 --> 04:37.943
I just downloaded
the blueprints.

04:37.945 --> 04:40.879
I'd say he'd put them near
the engine room or cargo hold.

04:40.881 --> 04:42.581
It's secluded.

04:42.583 --> 04:45.484
Cabe: You got 20 rockets to
disarm in 14 minutes a pop.

04:45.486 --> 04:46.718
We're never gonna get
five hours alone.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.053
We won't need it.
These rockets are

04:48.055 --> 04:50.289
Interfaced like
a laptop, phone and tablet.

04:50.291 --> 04:52.991
I program one, they all link up
disabled and trackable.

04:52.993 --> 04:54.026
How do we get aboard?

04:54.028 --> 04:55.594
We go as passengers.

04:55.596 --> 04:56.762
It's fully booked.

04:56.764 --> 04:58.397
But we can create a vacancy.

04:58.399 --> 04:59.765
Just got to find the right guy.

04:59.767 --> 05:00.932
Haven't rich people ever heard

05:00.934 --> 05:02.634
Of legionnaire's disease?

05:02.636 --> 05:03.669
Ahoy, mateys!

05:03.671 --> 05:05.504
It's chaz bonesteel.

05:05.506 --> 05:06.938
It must be a family name?

05:06.940 --> 05:09.341
From what I see here,
it's the only name that matters.

05:09.343 --> 05:12.010
At 21, he invested
his life savings

05:12.012 --> 05:13.945
In land thought
to be valueless.

05:13.947 --> 05:15.614
At now at 25,

05:15.616 --> 05:17.916
He's worth nine figures

05:17.918 --> 05:20.952
And at the epicenter
of the oil shale boom.

05:20.954 --> 05:23.055
He's considered
an investment guru.

05:23.057 --> 05:25.057
Oh, and intense
about his privacy.

05:25.059 --> 05:26.925
Known for not having
a single photo online.

05:26.927 --> 05:30.629
Okay, so what does
that have do with us?

05:30.631 --> 05:33.098
Well, he booked
the excelsior suite

05:33.100 --> 05:34.499
For himself, his wife, alissa,

05:34.501 --> 05:36.601
Their personal valet
and trainer.

05:36.603 --> 05:38.070
That's four people.
Walter:
Okay.

05:38.072 --> 05:41.039
Cabe, sylvester, paige, myself.

05:41.041 --> 05:43.375
We'll pose as them
to get access to the boat.

05:43.377 --> 05:45.043
Okay, uh, here's a shocker.

05:45.045 --> 05:47.112
I don't like boats.

05:47.114 --> 05:48.980
Primarily because they're
on the water.

05:48.982 --> 05:50.749
And I don't like water.

05:50.751 --> 05:52.617
We'll need three minutes
to get up the plank,

05:52.619 --> 05:54.353
Five to get
to the bowels,

05:54.355 --> 05:55.821
Approximately five minutes

05:55.823 --> 05:58.423
To locate the weapons
and 14 minutes

05:58.425 --> 06:01.126
And 32 seconds
to disarm and reprogram them.

06:01.128 --> 06:03.095
That's 27 minutes
and 32 seconds.

06:03.097 --> 06:04.429
So, we'll be off the boat

06:04.431 --> 06:06.431
By the time it departs.

06:06.433 --> 06:07.766
Besides you're
the only one of us

06:07.768 --> 06:09.034
That can pass for a 25-year-old.

06:09.036 --> 06:11.570
Guess I'll be the trainer.

06:11.572 --> 06:12.604
(laughs):
Right.

06:12.606 --> 06:13.972
Oh, you're serious.

06:13.974 --> 06:15.574
Okay.

06:15.576 --> 06:18.543
You'll be the trainer.
I will be the valet.

06:18.545 --> 06:20.011
Sylvester, you'll be chaz.

06:20.013 --> 06:21.146
And, paige,
you'll be alissa.

06:21.148 --> 06:22.848
And the real alissa and chaz?

06:22.850 --> 06:24.416
Uh, aren't they boarding
in a few hours?

06:24.418 --> 06:25.917
I'll make a call.
They'll have a little

06:25.919 --> 06:27.753
Trouble at customs when
they get in from canada.

06:27.755 --> 06:28.820
Walter, gear up.

06:28.822 --> 06:30.455
Happy, counterfeit some I.D.'s

06:30.457 --> 06:31.790
And tickets.
Toby, put together a file

06:31.792 --> 06:32.824
Of everything you can find

06:32.826 --> 06:34.025
On the bonesteels.

06:34.027 --> 06:35.093
And, sly?

06:35.095 --> 06:36.595
The shirt's not gonna cut it.

06:41.033 --> 06:43.568
Sylvester:
<i>In 2013,</i>

06:43.570 --> 06:46.905
The triumph carnival fire
left 4,000 passengers

06:46.907 --> 06:48.840
Floating in the gulf of mexico.

06:48.842 --> 06:51.143
2012-- the costa
concordia tragedy.

06:51.145 --> 06:53.879
Not to mention a little film
starring leonardo dicaprio

06:53.881 --> 06:54.980
And a giant boat?
Okay.

06:54.982 --> 06:56.948
We'll be in and
out in 20 minutes.

06:56.950 --> 06:58.116
Hello!
Hi! Welcome to pacific

06:58.118 --> 06:59.584
West cruises.

06:59.586 --> 07:01.453
There are four of us.

07:02.755 --> 07:04.189
Mr. And mrs. Bonesteel!

07:04.191 --> 07:05.590
Mm-hmm.

07:05.592 --> 07:08.059
We are thrilled
to welcome you aboard.

07:08.061 --> 07:09.094
Thrilled to be here.

07:09.096 --> 07:10.128
The vip cocktail reception

07:10.130 --> 07:11.930
Is on the lido deck.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.064
Wonderful, we'll be
in our room, so...

07:13.066 --> 07:14.433
No. We will do

07:14.435 --> 07:15.834
What we normally do, chaz.

07:15.836 --> 07:17.135
Where is the lido deck?

07:17.137 --> 07:19.037
The lido deck is the top deck.

07:19.039 --> 07:21.106
Wonderful.
Top deck above it all.

07:21.108 --> 07:22.474
20 minutes.

07:22.476 --> 07:23.575
The clock starts now.

07:23.577 --> 07:25.644
Mm-hmm.

07:26.579 --> 07:28.780
Tickets?

07:28.782 --> 07:29.981
Ow!
(grunts)

07:33.085 --> 07:36.087
Took us substantially longer
to board than we estimated.

07:36.089 --> 07:38.924
Blame the inefficient
cruise line.

07:38.926 --> 07:40.792
We still got
to locate the rockets,

07:40.794 --> 07:41.860
Disarm them and
get off the ship.

07:41.862 --> 07:43.128
And we're way behind.

07:43.130 --> 07:44.529
Yeah. No, I'm working on it.

07:44.531 --> 07:47.232
My software can test whether

07:47.234 --> 07:49.067
The rockets are reachable
across an ip network,

07:49.069 --> 07:51.803
Thus creating a traceable ping
for lack of a better word.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.171
So, where the hell's the ping?

07:53.173 --> 07:54.172
Give me a minute.

07:54.174 --> 07:57.476
(thud nearby)

07:59.245 --> 08:01.713
(shushes)
we've got company.

08:06.052 --> 08:07.953
Everything looks good.

08:07.955 --> 08:09.554
Pressure readouts are normal.

08:09.556 --> 08:11.089
I'll run a systems check
just to be safe.

08:11.091 --> 08:12.157
It'll just take a few minutes.

08:12.159 --> 08:16.161
You're calculating this into
your 20 minutes, right?

08:16.163 --> 08:17.696
We're minutes
from the boat leaving.

08:17.698 --> 08:19.130
Can't you, uh,

08:19.132 --> 08:22.267
Put him in a sleeper hold
or... Something?

08:22.269 --> 08:25.971
Someone will find him and alert
the boat and the bad guys.

08:25.973 --> 08:27.272
Just sit tight.

08:27.274 --> 08:29.274
Captain, we're
all clear down here.

08:29.276 --> 08:30.675
Roger.

08:30.677 --> 08:31.710
Cabe: See?

08:31.712 --> 08:33.278
Patience.

08:33.280 --> 08:35.881
Securing the bulkhead.

08:35.883 --> 08:37.115
Walter?

08:37.117 --> 08:39.651
I don't like the sound of that.

08:39.653 --> 08:43.188
(alarm blaring)

08:45.091 --> 08:47.158
Whoa, whoa!
Hold on, hold...

08:50.129 --> 08:52.664
Can you get us out of here?

08:52.666 --> 08:54.165
Yeah, I can.

08:54.167 --> 08:56.101
But by the time I do,

08:56.103 --> 08:59.571
We'll be in the middle
of the pacific.

08:59.573 --> 09:01.306
(ship horn blows twice)
paige!

09:01.308 --> 09:03.074
That was the "get off
the boat" noise.

09:03.076 --> 09:05.944
Where the hell are they?!

09:16.322 --> 09:18.323
Sylvester:
<i>Oh, this is not good!</i>

09:18.325 --> 09:19.691
I am on a boat!

09:19.693 --> 09:20.892
In the middle of the ocean!

09:20.894 --> 09:24.563
Those people were stranded
in shark-infested waters.

09:24.565 --> 09:25.630
You're on a luxury cruise boat.

09:25.632 --> 09:27.032
Paige, I can't swim.

09:28.267 --> 09:30.068
Maybe you can't.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.703
But chaz bonesteel can.

09:31.705 --> 09:32.804
In fact, chaz bonesteel

09:32.806 --> 09:33.905
Is a champion swimmer.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.240
And chaz bonesteel

09:35.242 --> 09:37.309
Can keep it together.

09:39.245 --> 09:40.812
Come on, walter,
I've seen you

09:40.814 --> 09:42.113
Diffuse bombs faster than this.

09:42.115 --> 09:43.582
It's a simple door pane.

09:43.584 --> 09:45.917
I'm trying to open
the bulkhead door

09:45.919 --> 09:47.752
Without alerting anyone
that we're down here.

09:47.754 --> 09:49.854
Can you give me a minute?

09:49.856 --> 09:51.923
Please?

09:51.925 --> 09:53.158
(cell phone ringing)

09:53.160 --> 09:54.659
Oh, geez!

09:54.661 --> 09:55.794
Ralph, are you okay?

09:55.796 --> 09:57.162
I think I'm sick.

09:57.164 --> 09:59.965
Ms. Dineen, he has
the chills pretty bad.

09:59.967 --> 10:01.032
Teeth were actually chattering.

10:01.034 --> 10:03.134
Paige:
Okay, well, I'm a little...

10:03.136 --> 10:05.904
Unavailable right now.

10:05.906 --> 10:07.806
Uh, I'll have to have
toby and happy pick you up.

10:07.808 --> 10:09.374
All right, honey?

10:09.376 --> 10:10.675
Thanks, mom.

10:10.677 --> 10:11.876
I love you.

10:14.847 --> 10:17.682
Would chaz be worried that
everything's going to hell?

10:20.953 --> 10:22.921
Appreciate it, nurse.

10:22.923 --> 10:24.055
No problem.

10:24.057 --> 10:25.991
Feel better, ralph.

10:25.993 --> 10:28.226
It's a bummer
you're feeling sick.

10:30.896 --> 10:32.263
You know, when you
get the chills,

10:32.265 --> 10:34.332
It means your body's
fighting an infection.

10:42.742 --> 10:44.809
(school bell ringing)

10:55.855 --> 10:57.155
A knapsack full of ice packs

10:57.157 --> 10:58.790
To make your teeth chatter?

11:00.026 --> 11:02.060
I've seen you hack
a thermometer, ralph.

11:02.062 --> 11:03.194
This is amateur hour.

11:03.196 --> 11:05.897
I had limited resources.

11:09.935 --> 11:11.136
Where the hell
have you been?

11:11.138 --> 11:12.370
We're out to sea.

11:12.372 --> 11:13.972
What exactly is the plan here?

11:13.974 --> 11:17.976
The rockets, we'll ride on
to the first stop in cancun.

11:17.978 --> 11:19.844
Homeland agents will meet us

11:19.846 --> 11:21.212
And get us across the border.

11:21.214 --> 11:23.048
My god, the kid's green.

11:23.050 --> 11:24.716
Walter:
Okay, let's all

11:24.718 --> 11:26.017
Get our comms in.

11:26.019 --> 11:28.987
I'm gonna call happy, make
sure that she's connected.

11:28.989 --> 11:31.890
This whole thing has not
gone according to plan,

11:31.892 --> 11:33.391
So we need to make sure
that we stay

11:33.393 --> 11:34.793
In constant communication.

11:34.795 --> 11:36.428
Cabe:
All right.

11:36.430 --> 11:38.263
Listen, keep an eye
on the kid.

11:38.265 --> 11:40.165
Get him to lie down or
something, and whatever you do,

11:40.167 --> 11:42.434
Don't leave this room
and don't talk to anyone.

11:42.436 --> 11:44.269
I'm gonna call happy,

11:44.271 --> 11:47.439
Find out why it was so difficult
to get a signal in the hull.

11:47.441 --> 11:48.907
Keep you posted.

11:48.909 --> 11:49.974
(knocking)
captain:
Mr. And mrs. Bonesteel?

11:50.910 --> 11:54.045
Paige, come answer it.

11:58.017 --> 11:59.784
Yes?
Mrs. Bonesteel.

11:59.786 --> 12:00.919
I'm captain steven caine.

12:00.921 --> 12:01.986
Welcome aboard.

12:01.988 --> 12:03.321
I wanted to personally
invite you

12:03.323 --> 12:05.256
And mr. Bonesteel to join me
at my table for lunch.

12:05.258 --> 12:07.192
Oh, the captain's table,
that sounds lovely.

12:07.194 --> 12:08.293
Wonderful.

12:08.295 --> 12:09.861
Many people are very excited

12:09.863 --> 12:11.162
About dining with mr. Bonesteel.

12:11.997 --> 12:13.331
Good, now I have to have lunch.

12:13.333 --> 12:15.066
Hm.

12:16.001 --> 12:18.403
Walter:
<i>Okay, so we meet back</i>

12:18.405 --> 12:20.371
At the room after our
respective missions, okay?

12:20.373 --> 12:23.007
And, uh, sly, please, uh,
try to lay off the dramamine.
Woman: Walter?

12:24.210 --> 12:25.510
That's an ex.

12:25.512 --> 12:27.011
Handle it fast.

12:27.013 --> 12:28.012
Hey.

12:28.014 --> 12:30.048
Are you working on the ship?

12:30.050 --> 12:31.382
Um, yes.

12:31.384 --> 12:34.119
I am, uh, currently,
uh, working.

12:34.121 --> 12:36.955
Tech support on a cruise
is a nice step up.

12:36.957 --> 12:38.289
Well, you know what they say.

12:38.291 --> 12:40.024
Onward and upward.

12:40.026 --> 12:42.894
Walter, we are going to lunch.

12:42.896 --> 12:45.797
Meet my dad at the shuffleboard.

12:45.799 --> 12:47.332
Okay.

12:47.334 --> 12:48.900
Is that woman the waitress?

12:48.902 --> 12:51.803
From that diner
you used to take me to?

12:51.805 --> 12:53.538
Yes, she did, uh,

12:53.540 --> 12:56.007
Work there for a while.

12:56.009 --> 12:57.142
So she's here with you?

12:57.144 --> 12:58.109
Are-are you two dating?

12:58.111 --> 13:00.111
No, we work together.

13:01.180 --> 13:03.414
Oh, the waitress
is a tech expert, too.

13:03.416 --> 13:04.983
Come on, walter.

13:04.985 --> 13:06.985
No, you don't understand.

13:06.987 --> 13:09.020
The truth is

13:09.022 --> 13:11.456
(whispering):
We work for the government.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.958
The government?

13:13.960 --> 13:15.160
You expect me to believe that?

13:15.162 --> 13:17.896
Man:
Janice!

13:17.898 --> 13:19.364
Come here; there's someone
I want you to meet.

13:19.366 --> 13:20.565
My fiancÃ©.

13:22.434 --> 13:25.570
Enjoy the cruise, walt.

13:34.079 --> 13:36.314
Happy, the signal's
still jumping around.

13:36.316 --> 13:39.150
The girders are
just steel alloy.

13:39.152 --> 13:42.887
Yeah, well, I'm down here,
and I'm telling you,

13:42.889 --> 13:44.088
I can't get a proper signal.

13:44.090 --> 13:45.190
Calm down. I'm trying to find

13:45.192 --> 13:46.191
An answer.

13:46.193 --> 13:48.359
Excuse me, I am perfectly calm.

13:48.361 --> 13:49.360
Yeah, you sound perfectly calm.

13:49.362 --> 13:51.095
Enough.

13:51.097 --> 13:52.363
This thing's echoing in my ear

13:52.365 --> 13:53.898
From you two acting
like children.

13:53.900 --> 13:55.466
Get it together.

13:55.468 --> 13:57.535
Echo?

13:58.470 --> 14:00.071
Wait.

14:00.073 --> 14:01.339
That's it, walt.

14:01.341 --> 14:02.974
There's got to be a hollow space

14:02.976 --> 14:06.411
That's causing the signal
to bounce around like an echo

14:06.413 --> 14:08.046
Whenever the boat swells.

14:08.048 --> 14:09.981
Yes, there should be
a crawlspace above you.

14:09.983 --> 14:11.249
Eight, maybe ten feet up?

14:11.251 --> 14:12.450
Oh, oh.

14:17.089 --> 14:18.990
Oh, yeah, I see it.
Hold that.

14:21.060 --> 14:22.560
Yeah, they're here.

14:23.395 --> 14:26.064
Hand it to me.

14:26.066 --> 14:28.266
Oh, cabe, happy was right.

14:28.268 --> 14:30.902
They're here.

14:32.137 --> 14:33.137
Thank you.

14:33.139 --> 14:35.907
Enjoy.

14:35.909 --> 14:37.008
Mr. Bonesteel,

14:37.010 --> 14:38.610
I read the article
where you mentioned

14:38.612 --> 14:41.346
Seared frog legs were
a particular favorite of yours.

14:42.414 --> 14:44.515
So I had some flown in.
Here you are.

14:45.918 --> 14:47.285
Paige:
Oh.

14:48.254 --> 14:49.954
Chaz just...

14:49.956 --> 14:51.589
Loves his amphibious meats.

14:51.591 --> 14:54.192
(clears throat)

14:55.661 --> 14:57.395
Thank you.

14:59.365 --> 15:01.532
(clears throat)

15:04.270 --> 15:05.270
You almost done?

15:05.272 --> 15:07.438
I'm only a few minutes in.

15:09.275 --> 15:10.408
Besides, it's dark in here.

15:10.410 --> 15:12.110
You got 197 iq,

15:12.112 --> 15:14.045
And you don't know how
to operate a flashlight?

15:14.047 --> 15:15.179
Are you kidding me?

15:15.181 --> 15:17.248
(gun clicks)
who are you?

15:18.117 --> 15:21.085
Just a little lost.

15:21.087 --> 15:22.587
Lost, huh?

15:22.589 --> 15:24.122
Down here in the cargo hold?

15:24.124 --> 15:25.189
Turn around.

15:25.191 --> 15:27.225
On your knees now.

15:27.227 --> 15:30.161
Okay, okay.

15:30.163 --> 15:33.264
Don't move.

15:36.068 --> 15:38.369
Who you working for?

15:39.972 --> 15:41.940
I said, who do you work for?

15:43.676 --> 15:45.310
I'm not gonna ask you again.

15:52.217 --> 15:54.085
(grunting)

15:58.691 --> 15:59.657
Damn it.

15:59.659 --> 16:00.959
Our cover's blown.

16:00.961 --> 16:02.260
In a few minutes,

16:02.262 --> 16:03.161
Whoever he's working for

16:03.163 --> 16:04.462
Is gonna be looking for us.

16:04.464 --> 16:06.064
Oh, we don't have enough time.

16:06.066 --> 16:08.299
Forget about
installing the gps.

16:08.301 --> 16:10.368
Just deactivate
the damn things.

16:10.370 --> 16:11.636
Grab them and go.

16:11.638 --> 16:14.305
Chaz, when did you know

16:14.307 --> 16:16.040
That you'd made it?

16:19.378 --> 16:21.012
(clears throat)

16:21.014 --> 16:24.182
Tell them the story...

16:24.184 --> 16:25.450
Chaz.

16:25.452 --> 16:27.719
Well...

16:29.722 --> 16:32.290
My grandfather
once took me ice fishing.

16:32.292 --> 16:35.193
And we dropped our lines
and we waited,

16:35.195 --> 16:37.362
But I was impatient.

16:41.033 --> 16:42.567
So I said to my grandfather,

16:42.569 --> 16:44.635
"grandfather,

16:44.637 --> 16:47.572
My feet are frozen and I'd like
to go home, please."

16:47.574 --> 16:49.140
(chuckles)

16:51.710 --> 16:54.345
And he said, "son, grandson,

16:54.347 --> 16:57.115
"when your feet are frozen,

16:57.117 --> 17:00.084
"that is when the fish

17:00.086 --> 17:02.053
Are the warmest."

17:05.290 --> 17:07.191
Man:
Excuse me, captain.

17:10.496 --> 17:13.164
If you'll all excuse me,
I have a call I have to take.

17:15.501 --> 17:17.235
Server: Excuse me, sir,
your next course.

17:18.303 --> 17:20.071
Oh.

17:20.073 --> 17:22.173
Escargot.

17:22.175 --> 17:25.243
Oh, that's a lot of snails.

17:25.245 --> 17:27.111
Please, no.

17:27.113 --> 17:29.480
There's some light over here.

17:29.482 --> 17:31.315
Here, hold that.

17:31.317 --> 17:33.751
Yeah.

17:33.753 --> 17:35.486
Hurry up.

17:35.488 --> 17:37.722
(engines whining)

17:37.724 --> 17:39.190
This is your captain.

17:39.192 --> 17:42.126
To the casino on the main deck.
No, that's not good.

17:42.128 --> 17:43.628
Thank you.
Put the ship into idle.

17:43.630 --> 17:45.229
That's no coincidence.

17:45.231 --> 17:46.330
They can't find us,

17:46.332 --> 17:47.832
So they're going
after the passengers.

17:48.767 --> 17:50.101
Please, keep coming in.

17:50.103 --> 17:51.769
Yes, that's it.
Just this way, folks.

17:51.771 --> 17:53.137
That's right, right in here.
Do you think

17:53.139 --> 17:54.639
Chaz would find this odd?

17:54.641 --> 17:56.774
Not sure, but I certainly do.

17:56.776 --> 17:58.209
Captain:
Plenty of room.

17:58.211 --> 17:59.811
Please, please keep coming.
That's it.

17:59.813 --> 18:01.813
Yes, ma'am. Yes, I know.
Make your way

18:01.815 --> 18:05.149
To the back of the room. There
is plenty of space for everyone.

18:05.151 --> 18:06.384
All is fine,
nothing to worry about.

18:06.386 --> 18:07.618
I'm feeling very
strange about this.

18:07.620 --> 18:10.121
Paige: They don't look
like ship security.

18:10.123 --> 18:11.823
Sylvester:
Why are they blocking the doors?

18:11.825 --> 18:14.192
(doors close)
all right, everyone, please,

18:14.194 --> 18:17.228
Everything is going to be
absolutely fine.

18:17.230 --> 18:18.396
(groans, passengers scream)

18:21.233 --> 18:23.301
Thank you, captain.

18:25.270 --> 18:27.205
I'll take it from here.

18:27.207 --> 18:28.506
(gun clicks)

18:28.508 --> 18:29.807
(gasping)

18:29.809 --> 18:31.175
Ladies and gentlemen,

18:31.177 --> 18:32.877
If you want to live,

18:32.879 --> 18:35.246
There's one thing
that you need to understand.

18:35.248 --> 18:37.315
Oh, my god.

18:37.317 --> 18:39.150
This is my ship now.

18:48.494 --> 18:50.161
Hurry up.

18:50.163 --> 18:51.329
Henchman:
Electronic devices in the bag.

18:51.331 --> 18:52.864
In the bag.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.601
Henchman 2:
We searched the ship.

18:56.603 --> 19:00.238
I looked for the rockets;
they're not where we left them.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.572
Cell phone in the bag!

19:01.574 --> 19:02.773
Cell phone in the bag now, lady!

19:02.775 --> 19:04.275
(gunshots)

19:06.712 --> 19:08.146
Do I have everyone's attention?

19:13.719 --> 19:15.453
One of you knows
where my cargo is.

19:15.455 --> 19:17.822
I intend to get it back.

19:17.824 --> 19:21.559
This is a passenger manifest.

19:21.561 --> 19:22.927
So,

19:22.929 --> 19:24.662
If you cannot produce
an identification

19:24.664 --> 19:26.464
That's on this list,

19:26.466 --> 19:28.566
Well then,

19:28.568 --> 19:30.902
Today is not your lucky day.

19:30.904 --> 19:32.236
Roger that, sir.

19:32.238 --> 19:33.738
We'll be prepared.

19:33.740 --> 19:37.575
Navy's sending a military copter
to handle the hostage situation.

19:37.577 --> 19:38.809
They're linking up our comms,

19:38.811 --> 19:40.411
But if those goons find us,
they can't

19:40.413 --> 19:42.213
Have live rockets with
helicopters approaching.

19:42.215 --> 19:43.314
I'm almost done.

19:45.217 --> 19:46.851
Walter, where are you?

19:46.853 --> 19:48.486
We got caught in the bowels
of the ship.

19:48.488 --> 19:49.654
Why? What's going on?

19:49.656 --> 19:50.855
We are in the casino.

19:50.857 --> 19:52.290
Christoph is reading
the manifest,

19:52.292 --> 19:53.791
And once he gets to bonesteel,

19:53.793 --> 19:55.660
We are in big trouble.

19:55.662 --> 19:57.929
The laminate that happy used
on both of our I.D.'s

19:57.931 --> 20:00.831
Is only a few hours old,
and if he shines a light on it,

20:00.833 --> 20:01.799
It'll read as fake.

20:01.801 --> 20:02.800
Time frame?

20:02.802 --> 20:04.368
Well, okay, statistically,

20:04.370 --> 20:06.637
B is the fifth most common start
to a surname,

20:06.639 --> 20:07.772
And a is the twelfth.

20:07.774 --> 20:09.607
How much time, sylvester?

20:09.609 --> 20:11.509
Okay, three minutes, tops.

20:11.511 --> 20:13.544
New plan.

20:13.546 --> 20:15.379
You have to finish disarming
the rockets first.

20:15.381 --> 20:16.847
We don't have enough time.

20:16.849 --> 20:18.282
The rockets will take
another four minutes.

20:18.284 --> 20:20.251
Paige and sylvester
will be dead in three.

20:21.486 --> 20:22.954
What the hell do we do?

20:22.956 --> 20:25.556
Grab me a beer.

20:25.558 --> 20:27.925
I have an idea.

20:30.329 --> 20:32.897
Ralph:
<i>I wanted to give sloan</i>
<i>a valentine,</i>

20:32.899 --> 20:34.498
But jason gave her one first.

20:34.500 --> 20:36.534
Ralphie boy,
you got to be persistent.

20:36.536 --> 20:38.536
There are some girls
who don't know a good thing

20:38.538 --> 20:40.304
When it's right
in front of them,

20:40.306 --> 20:42.707
No matter how many times
it has been offered.

20:44.643 --> 20:47.311
You and sloan are friends,
right, ralph?

20:47.313 --> 20:49.313
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

20:49.315 --> 20:51.415
Happy:
Well, maybe

20:51.417 --> 20:53.484
She doesn't want
to jeopardize your friendship.

20:53.486 --> 20:55.353
Maybe

20:55.355 --> 20:57.989
She's never had a best friend
like you before

20:57.991 --> 21:00.258
And that probably
means a lot to her.

21:02.361 --> 21:03.494
So don't take it personally.

21:03.496 --> 21:04.996
You just have to be patient.

21:04.998 --> 21:06.030
How patient?
Like, if you had

21:06.032 --> 21:10.768
I really don't know what
we're talking about anymore.

21:13.739 --> 21:16.040
(phone ringing)

21:19.578 --> 21:21.345
Talk to me.

21:21.347 --> 21:22.913
Walter:
We have a situation here.

21:22.915 --> 21:25.349
All the passengers
have been taken hostage,

21:25.351 --> 21:26.651
Including paige and sylvester.

21:26.653 --> 21:28.486
So I need you to find a spot

21:28.488 --> 21:30.388
In the hull

21:30.390 --> 21:32.623
Where I can access
the ship's intercom.

21:35.627 --> 21:38.029
Okay, I'm in the ship's
broadcasting system.

21:38.031 --> 21:39.430
What are you up to?

21:39.432 --> 21:41.032
There's no intercom down here,

21:41.034 --> 21:42.400
So I'm building one.

21:42.402 --> 21:44.635
If we're gonna negotiate
with our captors,

21:44.637 --> 21:46.337
We have to able
to talk to them first.

21:46.339 --> 21:48.306
Grab that;
let's go.

21:48.308 --> 21:49.840
Happy:
It should be on your left side.

21:49.842 --> 21:50.841
Here it is, here it is.

21:50.843 --> 21:51.842
(grunts)

21:51.844 --> 21:54.078
Ah, thank you, happy.

21:54.080 --> 21:56.781
Once we get
a current,

21:56.783 --> 22:00.084
The can will act
as a microphone.

22:00.086 --> 22:02.386
I'll have it broadcast
over every speaker

22:02.388 --> 22:04.755
On the ship.
Watch
yourself.

22:04.757 --> 22:07.625
Sylvester:
Okay, walter, you have
approximately 30 seconds

22:07.627 --> 22:09.794
Until they call bonesteel.

22:09.796 --> 22:12.463
They will kill
me and paige.

22:13.699 --> 22:15.032
You sure
about this?

22:15.034 --> 22:16.067
There's no hiding
once it's done.

22:16.069 --> 22:17.902
We have no choice.

22:17.904 --> 22:20.104
Barclay, phineas.

22:23.475 --> 22:24.542
What are we going to do?

22:24.544 --> 22:26.444
When he sees our ids,

22:26.446 --> 22:28.379
He'll know that they're bogus.

22:28.381 --> 22:30.448
Christoph:
Bonesteel...

22:30.450 --> 22:32.450
Alissa.

22:38.090 --> 22:40.057
Alissa bonesteel.

22:40.059 --> 22:42.760
Just stay right here, okay?

22:45.464 --> 22:46.497
It's okay, come here.

22:48.467 --> 22:49.533
Ow!

22:49.535 --> 22:51.635
Christoph:
I will put a bullet

22:51.637 --> 22:54.472
In her ponytail

22:54.474 --> 22:56.841
If ms. Alissa bonesteel
does not step forward.

22:56.843 --> 22:58.476
I am!

22:58.478 --> 23:01.379
I... I am...

23:01.381 --> 23:03.147
Alissa bonesteel.

23:03.149 --> 23:05.082
(whimpers)

23:07.986 --> 23:09.553
Trouble hearing?

23:09.555 --> 23:11.555
No, I...

23:11.557 --> 23:12.990
I'm just scared

23:12.992 --> 23:15.059
Because I left
my id in my room.

23:19.464 --> 23:22.433
(gasps)

23:23.168 --> 23:25.870
I'm gonna take
a wild guess

23:25.872 --> 23:27.538
That you know where my cargo is.

23:29.775 --> 23:32.410
Paige:
I don't know.

23:35.147 --> 23:36.680
I don't know--
no, please, please.

23:36.682 --> 23:39.483
I have a son.

23:39.485 --> 23:40.718
Christoph:
In three seconds.

23:40.720 --> 23:42.653
Your son will
have no mother.

23:42.655 --> 23:43.788
And then...
(whimpers)

23:43.790 --> 23:45.156
...I'm gonna pay
him a visit.
No...

23:45.158 --> 23:46.757
Walter (over intercom):
Release the hostages

23:46.759 --> 23:48.826
Or I throw your rockets
overboard.

23:48.828 --> 23:50.561
(passengers murmuring)

23:50.563 --> 23:51.862
Are you kidding me?

23:54.533 --> 23:56.200
All right,
come on.

24:02.774 --> 24:04.775
Yes, this is the man
you stole from.

24:04.777 --> 24:05.943
Who's this, please?

24:05.945 --> 24:08.479
My name is not important;
what I have is.

24:08.481 --> 24:11.148
Correct.

24:11.150 --> 24:14.752
But what I have is
even more precious.

24:17.088 --> 24:18.856
And I will kill them,

24:18.858 --> 24:20.124
One by one,

24:20.126 --> 24:21.859
Unless you bring me my weapons

24:21.861 --> 24:23.461
Immediately.

24:24.496 --> 24:25.963
(quietly):
You give him those rockets

24:25.965 --> 24:28.966
And he'll shoot that rescue
copter right out of the sky.

24:30.135 --> 24:31.535
Happy?

24:31.537 --> 24:33.070
There has to be
another vessel nearby.

24:33.072 --> 24:35.773
Can you locate anything?
I'm looking.

24:36.608 --> 24:38.809
You have five seconds to comply.

24:38.811 --> 24:39.877
Hurry, happy.

24:39.879 --> 24:41.579
Five...

24:41.581 --> 24:43.914
Four...
No...

24:43.916 --> 24:45.716
A japanese destroyer
isn't too far away.

24:45.718 --> 24:46.750
Three...

24:46.752 --> 24:48.018
Hack the destroyer's
control system.

24:48.020 --> 24:49.587
Two...

24:49.589 --> 24:50.821
One.

24:50.823 --> 24:52.056
Woman:
No, no, no, no....

24:52.058 --> 24:53.757
Walter:
Okay, okay, okay! You win.

24:53.759 --> 24:55.259
Lido deck, five minutes,

24:55.261 --> 24:56.694
With the rockets.

24:56.696 --> 24:58.062
Perfect.

24:58.064 --> 24:59.697
Grab the captain.
You...

24:59.699 --> 25:01.131
Take tennille.

25:01.133 --> 25:03.634
Let's go.

25:03.636 --> 25:04.802
Pilot (over comms):
Navy 6-4.

25:04.804 --> 25:05.870
Four minutes out and closing.

25:05.872 --> 25:08.539
Okay, hold...

25:12.511 --> 25:14.078
Walter:
Okay.

25:14.080 --> 25:15.079
Okay, okay.

25:15.081 --> 25:16.080
That's close enough.

25:16.082 --> 25:18.849
Or they go
overboard.

25:21.286 --> 25:23.721
Can I have my
rockets now, please?

25:23.723 --> 25:26.190
Give me your word
you'll let the passengers go.

25:30.529 --> 25:31.929
You see this gun?

25:31.931 --> 25:33.564
It's got a sensitive trigger.

25:33.566 --> 25:35.966
Sometimes it goes off

25:35.968 --> 25:37.301
When I've barely
even touched it.

25:37.303 --> 25:39.870
You guys want to see?

25:39.872 --> 25:41.038
No, no, no.

25:41.040 --> 25:42.873
No, no.

25:42.875 --> 25:44.875
Okay.

25:46.811 --> 25:47.878
Put the gun down.

25:47.880 --> 25:48.946
Thank you.

25:48.948 --> 25:50.014
Search them.

25:58.557 --> 25:59.657
Raul's.

26:04.195 --> 26:06.263
I'm sorry, who are
you two guys working for?

26:08.867 --> 26:11.602
Nothing?

26:11.604 --> 26:12.836
(grunts)
hey!

26:12.838 --> 26:14.939
(coughing)

26:14.941 --> 26:15.973
(feedback whines)
oh.

26:15.975 --> 26:18.309
Oh.

26:18.311 --> 26:20.578
Who have you been talking to?

26:22.080 --> 26:23.981
Pilot (over comms):
This is navy 6-2.

26:23.983 --> 26:26.317
We are five miles out, roughly
two minutes to intercept.

26:26.319 --> 26:28.252
Are we clear to approach,
agent gallo? Over.

26:30.021 --> 26:33.290
Tell them everything is fine.

26:33.292 --> 26:34.758
Pilot:
Repeat. Are we clear to land?

26:34.760 --> 26:35.159
Over.

26:39.631 --> 26:40.931
Cabe:
Okay. Okay.

26:40.933 --> 26:43.801
This is agent cabe gallo.

26:43.803 --> 26:45.669
You're clear to approach.

26:45.671 --> 26:47.071
Good job.

26:47.073 --> 26:48.072
Take 'em over there.

26:48.074 --> 26:50.240
Move!
Go, go! To the rail.

26:50.242 --> 26:52.276
You all right?
To the rail.
Now, now. Move it.

26:55.880 --> 26:57.381
Now for the fireworks.

27:08.059 --> 27:09.660
Booyah!

27:15.767 --> 27:18.102
We got painted! Single rocket
tracking us now! Slice right!

27:18.104 --> 27:21.171
Verona, this is romeo.
We have been engaged.

27:21.173 --> 27:23.307
Chopper's
five miles out,

27:23.309 --> 27:24.708
Give them standard
approach speed...

27:24.710 --> 27:26.243
Impact in 90 seconds.

27:28.947 --> 27:31.281
You ever been scuba diving?

27:43.795 --> 27:44.928
(cabe grunts)

27:45.731 --> 27:47.731
What are you
standing around for?

27:47.733 --> 27:49.266
Get them!

27:52.137 --> 27:54.071
Okay. We gotta get
in touch with happy.

27:55.206 --> 27:57.875
Happy, have you hacked
into that destroyer yet?

27:57.877 --> 28:00.044
How much time we got?
45 seconds.

28:00.046 --> 28:02.046
We got 45 seconds
until that rocket

28:02.048 --> 28:03.747
Takes out a u.S.
Military helicopter.

28:03.749 --> 28:05.916
Thank you for filling me in
on the stakes now.

28:05.918 --> 28:07.117
We're in the ship's
weapons system,

28:07.119 --> 28:08.318
But we need more time.

28:08.320 --> 28:09.353
The japanese are alerted

28:09.355 --> 28:10.688
To our trojan horse entry,

28:10.690 --> 28:12.189
And they're
throwing up firewalls.

28:12.191 --> 28:14.258
Cabe:
Just figure something out.

28:16.327 --> 28:18.262
Pilot:
<i>Rocket closing.</i>

28:18.264 --> 28:20.130
1.8 miles.
Alter our vector!

28:20.132 --> 28:21.465
Cabe:
<i>This is agent cabe gallo.</i>

28:21.467 --> 28:23.333
If you want to live
to tell this war story,

28:23.335 --> 28:25.069
Do exactly as I say.

28:25.071 --> 28:26.403
We only have 30 seconds.

28:26.405 --> 28:28.305
There's no time
for evasive maneuvers.

28:28.307 --> 28:30.007
Hold your course.

28:30.009 --> 28:31.175
Do nothing?

28:31.177 --> 28:32.409
Cabe:
The less you move,

28:32.411 --> 28:33.744
The less the rocket moves.

28:33.746 --> 28:34.812
We're gonna intercept it.

28:34.814 --> 28:35.979
Using what?!

28:35.981 --> 28:38.115
(alarms blaring)

28:38.117 --> 28:40.184
(speaking japanese)

28:46.758 --> 28:49.860
Wow, you picked a hell of
a day to ditch school, kid.

28:52.363 --> 28:53.831
(missile launching)

28:56.067 --> 28:58.235
Cabe:
Maintain your position,
lieutenant!

29:03.041 --> 29:04.775
Lieutenant...

29:06.144 --> 29:08.345
Talk to me, guys.

29:08.347 --> 29:09.379
We're good.

29:09.381 --> 29:10.848
We're alive.

29:10.850 --> 29:13.016
Can't say the same
for our fuel line, though.

29:13.018 --> 29:15.085
We shook up pretty bad.

29:15.087 --> 29:16.220
We're pouring gas.

29:16.222 --> 29:17.421
No chance we could
make it to you.

29:17.423 --> 29:19.890
Better come up with
a plan "b," walter.

29:22.193 --> 29:24.495
How about a plan "c"?

29:25.997 --> 29:26.997
Thug:
Go, go, go.

29:26.999 --> 29:27.998
Walter:
Okay.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.433
Christoph:
Here they are!

29:29.435 --> 29:32.035
The men who cause us
nothing but trouble.

29:32.037 --> 29:34.772
In a few moments, the navy's
gonna send another helo,

29:34.774 --> 29:37.407
So... You can tell me

29:37.409 --> 29:39.543
What agencies
you work for,

29:39.545 --> 29:41.478
Or you guys are going
into the sea.

29:44.349 --> 29:45.482
Well...

29:46.885 --> 29:49.153
Yeah, we're, uh...

29:49.155 --> 29:50.420
We're here working with...

29:51.990 --> 29:54.158
(grunting)

30:01.166 --> 30:02.800
Freeze! Hold it!

30:02.802 --> 30:05.169
Hold it!
Hold it right there!

30:05.171 --> 30:06.170
Good work.

30:06.172 --> 30:07.437
Give me the gun

30:07.439 --> 30:08.472
And we'll put 'em in the hold.

30:08.474 --> 30:10.207
Not exactly, agent.
Hey.

30:15.446 --> 30:17.281
You're with christoph.

30:17.283 --> 30:18.482
No...

30:21.319 --> 30:22.452
...He is christoph.

30:24.289 --> 30:25.355
Licensed captain,

30:25.357 --> 30:29.326
Minimal customs issues compared
to big cruise liners...

30:29.328 --> 30:30.994
It's perfect front
for big weapons.

30:30.996 --> 30:31.995
Yes.

30:31.997 --> 30:33.597
It surely was.

30:33.599 --> 30:35.265
Raul.

30:35.267 --> 30:38.402
We need to get these rockets
off the ship.

30:38.404 --> 30:39.403
Grab the girl,

30:39.405 --> 30:40.904
Meet me on the lower deck.

30:43.474 --> 30:44.575
Move!
(screams)

30:44.577 --> 30:45.876
Come with me.

30:45.878 --> 30:47.544
Hey! Hey.
Take me. Take me.
Hey!

30:48.346 --> 30:50.214
(passengers screaming)

30:50.216 --> 30:51.415
Don't move.

30:51.417 --> 30:53.217
Let's go.

30:59.924 --> 31:01.425
(passengers exclaiming,
shouting)

31:01.427 --> 31:03.927
Woman 1:
Hey! Get us out of here!

31:03.929 --> 31:05.095
(indistinct shouting)

31:05.097 --> 31:06.396
Man:
What's going on?

31:06.398 --> 31:07.397
Okay.

31:07.399 --> 31:08.465
Man 2:
We can't get out.

31:08.467 --> 31:09.600
Man:
Wait, wait...

31:09.602 --> 31:11.869
All right, okay.

31:16.541 --> 31:18.475
Hold this.
What the hell are you doing?

31:18.477 --> 31:21.078
Chaz bonesteel
ain't going out like this.

31:22.146 --> 31:24.047
(groans)

31:24.049 --> 31:26.383
Okay.

31:26.385 --> 31:29.019
Come on, bonesteel.
Come on, bonesteel.

31:29.021 --> 31:30.654
(panting):
Okay.

31:37.929 --> 31:40.197
I'm gonna need a boost.

31:41.165 --> 31:42.432
Paige: Please, no.
Man: Come on.

31:42.434 --> 31:43.533
Please, no.
Let's go!

31:43.535 --> 31:45.035
Get her in the raft.
Come on!

31:45.037 --> 31:46.236
We got to move fast.
No.

31:46.238 --> 31:48.672
Please, please.
Let's go!

31:48.674 --> 31:50.540
Hold on, hold on.
You want to guarantee

31:50.542 --> 31:53.010
They don't blow you out
of the water? Take me.

31:53.012 --> 31:54.144
Why is that?

31:54.146 --> 31:55.946
I'm a high-value
government asset.

31:55.948 --> 31:57.047
You take me,

31:57.049 --> 31:58.482
You'll have
a fighting chance.

31:58.484 --> 31:59.683
Let her go.

31:59.685 --> 32:01.551
Walter, don't.

32:03.688 --> 32:05.489
Right. Get on.

32:05.491 --> 32:07.391
No!

32:09.093 --> 32:11.094
Man:
Let's go!
Walter.

32:16.701 --> 32:18.468
Caine:
Let's go.

32:27.578 --> 32:30.714
(grunting, panting)

32:30.716 --> 32:33.116
Caine (in distance):
Come on. Move it!

32:47.465 --> 32:50.667
You can do this.
You can do this.

32:50.669 --> 32:52.636
(grunting)

32:56.140 --> 32:58.542
Bonesteel!

33:07.318 --> 33:09.186
Wha...?

33:09.188 --> 33:10.721
(brief burst of gunfire)

33:14.325 --> 33:15.993
Walter:
Sly, where are you?

33:15.995 --> 33:18.729
Ah, I... I'm tangled
in the rope.

33:18.731 --> 33:20.063
I can't get free.

33:21.632 --> 33:23.400
Sylvester: It's dragging me
back. It's dragging me under.

33:29.540 --> 33:32.342
Oh, god.

33:32.344 --> 33:36.179
Walter, the suction from the
propeller is pulling me in.

33:36.181 --> 33:38.281
It's too strong.
Hold on, buddy.

33:38.283 --> 33:40.117
Hold on!
Walter?

33:40.119 --> 33:42.019
Walter.
Sylvester!

33:42.021 --> 33:44.121
They need to shut off
the propeller.

33:44.123 --> 33:46.456
The crew's...

33:46.458 --> 33:48.091
Locked up.

33:48.093 --> 33:50.160
Happy, I'm gonna need your help.

33:51.295 --> 33:54.297
Walter:
Cabe! Cabe, where are you?

33:58.803 --> 34:00.137
Cabe!

34:00.139 --> 34:01.338
Cabe, sylvester!

34:01.340 --> 34:03.040
Here! Grab my hand.

34:03.042 --> 34:05.108
Walter, it's pulling too strong.
Cabe, don't let me go.

34:05.110 --> 34:07.577
Hold on, kid! Grab my hand!
Don't let me go.

34:07.579 --> 34:09.046
Happy, I'm here.

34:09.048 --> 34:10.480
Happy: Okay, take
the throttles out of gear.

34:10.482 --> 34:12.649
The control handles are in
the middle of the panel.

34:12.651 --> 34:14.084
(sighs)
okay, I see them.

34:14.086 --> 34:16.620
Push them both down toward you.

34:16.622 --> 34:18.221
Cabe:
Hold on, kid!

34:18.223 --> 34:20.190
I don't think I'm
gonna make it.
Hold on!

34:21.159 --> 34:22.225
It's not working.

34:22.227 --> 34:23.360
Happy:
Okay, you need to pull

34:23.362 --> 34:25.796
There should be a handle
on the floor somewhere.

34:25.798 --> 34:28.198
Oh, I see it. Okay.

34:31.235 --> 34:32.235
Walter:
Don't let go!

34:32.237 --> 34:33.103
Come on.

34:33.105 --> 34:34.304
(grunting)

34:36.574 --> 34:38.775
(sighs)
thank god.

34:38.777 --> 34:40.710
I got it.

34:40.712 --> 34:42.846
It worked.

34:42.848 --> 34:44.214
Cabe:
Take a breath, kid.

34:44.216 --> 34:45.549
Everything's gonna
be okay, pal.

34:45.551 --> 34:47.150
(sylvester panting)

34:47.152 --> 34:50.087
Take it easy.
Take it easy.

34:50.089 --> 34:52.389
Sylvester:
Cabe, watch out! (gasping)

34:52.391 --> 34:53.723
You really screwed this up.

34:53.725 --> 34:56.693
The people I promised
those rockets to--

34:56.695 --> 34:59.729
They're gonna take my life,
so I'm gonna take yours.

34:59.731 --> 35:02.799
(ship's horn blowing)

35:08.239 --> 35:10.173
Walter:
No, you got it.
You got it.

35:10.175 --> 35:12.175
Was I right about boats?
Yeah, probably.

35:12.177 --> 35:14.111
I was right about boats.
Yeah. Okay.

35:14.113 --> 35:15.512
Yeah, you're
right. Yeah.

35:15.514 --> 35:17.414
(grunting)
okay.

35:17.416 --> 35:19.549
Paige: <i>Yeah, we had</i>
<i>an interesting day.</i>

35:19.551 --> 35:21.251
<i>We were on a</i>

35:21.253 --> 35:23.320
Big, beautiful
cruise ship, and, uh...

35:23.322 --> 35:25.322
So, um...

35:26.891 --> 35:28.825
So you really do work
for the government.

35:28.827 --> 35:30.494
Yep.

35:30.496 --> 35:34.231
I, uh... Always did
tell you the truth,

35:34.233 --> 35:36.166
So, um...

35:36.168 --> 35:39.169
I was wondering if you
could tell me the truth.

35:39.171 --> 35:41.338
What could I do better

35:41.340 --> 35:44.241
So that th-the mistakes
that I made with you...

35:44.243 --> 35:47.244
That I-I don't make them again?

35:47.246 --> 35:49.346
You are who you are.

35:49.348 --> 35:50.881
But you're challenging

35:50.883 --> 35:53.683
And sometimes
impossible because

35:53.685 --> 35:56.586
No woman can stimulate
that mind of yours forever.

35:56.588 --> 35:58.255
If you want honesty...

36:00.525 --> 36:03.593
...After a while,
you lost interest in me--

36:03.595 --> 36:06.596
I could tell-- and that hurt.

36:07.899 --> 36:10.233
Oh.

36:10.235 --> 36:12.536
I'm sorry.

36:13.638 --> 36:16.540
There's no malice in you,
walter.

36:16.542 --> 36:18.542
Just facts.

36:18.544 --> 36:21.311
And, um...

36:21.313 --> 36:22.679
Things didn't go
exactly like we planned.

36:22.681 --> 36:24.915
...The fact is,

36:24.917 --> 36:27.584
Before you get involved
with someone else,

36:27.586 --> 36:30.554
Make sure you can
make a real connection.

36:30.556 --> 36:32.389
It wouldn't be fair
to her otherwise.

36:34.859 --> 36:36.826
Take care of yourself.

36:44.335 --> 36:45.969
Mm-hmm.

36:50.274 --> 36:52.776
(sighs)
you ready, ralph?

36:52.778 --> 36:55.412
Once I start this fire,
there's no putting it out.

37:00.384 --> 37:01.985
Back up. Let's go.
Come on.

37:12.697 --> 37:13.997
And...

37:13.999 --> 37:15.365
There's the money.

37:18.836 --> 37:21.304
Where's the lucky lady?

37:22.740 --> 37:24.541
Well, I'm breaking
about 12 laws right now,

37:24.543 --> 37:27.410
So I suggest you talk to her
while you can.

37:35.653 --> 37:37.787
I'm gonna seal the deal
for the kid.

37:37.789 --> 37:39.489
(whooshing)

37:40.758 --> 37:43.393
Toby:
Ah, crap.

37:44.428 --> 37:45.996
"love, ralhp."

37:48.466 --> 37:51.301
Toby: Look at 'em.
They're both content.

37:51.303 --> 37:54.537
Love can be misspelled
and messy, but it still works.

37:54.539 --> 37:56.673
Just needs to be
given a chance.

38:03.581 --> 38:06.016
Oh, forget it.

38:20.798 --> 38:22.666
Whoa, what are you doing?

38:22.668 --> 38:24.467
Are you gonna punch me?

38:24.469 --> 38:26.303
I don't think so.

38:26.305 --> 38:27.504
Okay, then.

38:27.506 --> 38:29.506
Woman:
What is going on?!

38:29.508 --> 38:31.308
This is extremely dangerous!

38:31.310 --> 38:32.942
I have called the police.
Damn it.

38:32.944 --> 38:34.811
This cannot happen
on school grounds!
Let's go, ralph.

38:34.813 --> 38:36.012
What...?
She called the fuzz.

38:36.014 --> 38:37.347
What about sloan?

38:37.349 --> 38:38.915
Don't worry.
Chicks dig outlaws.

38:38.917 --> 38:40.784
Start the car!

38:40.786 --> 38:42.852
â™ª

38:46.590 --> 38:47.791
Hey.

38:48.759 --> 38:50.427
Uh, are we
still doing

38:50.429 --> 38:51.628
That business dinner
tomorrow night?

38:51.630 --> 38:53.430
(sighs)

38:53.432 --> 38:54.864
You know, um...

38:54.866 --> 38:57.467
I've been thinking
about that, now.

38:58.803 --> 39:01.905
You've been working hard
lately, and, uh...

39:01.907 --> 39:04.341
I don't want to take up
your Saturday.

39:04.343 --> 39:06.710
If you think there's stuff
we should go over...

39:06.712 --> 39:08.345
You're an incredible asset
to the team,

39:08.347 --> 39:09.579
And I want what's best for you.

39:09.581 --> 39:11.448
That's a weekend off.

39:11.450 --> 39:14.084
Especially with a case
like today.

39:15.453 --> 39:16.753
Okay.

39:19.090 --> 39:20.390
I'll see you Monday.

39:20.392 --> 39:21.758
Monday.

39:34.739 --> 39:37.374
Are you sending
a valentine to megan?

39:39.910 --> 39:42.078
Why is that a secret?

39:42.080 --> 39:44.547
(whispering):
Because she's walter's sister.

39:44.549 --> 39:45.849
I know that.

39:45.851 --> 39:47.784
So...

39:47.786 --> 39:49.519
He's my boss

39:49.521 --> 39:50.920
And my best friend.

39:50.922 --> 39:52.689
And she's sweet,
and you like her.

39:55.092 --> 39:56.626
(sighs)

39:56.628 --> 39:58.895
Chaz would send her
that valentine.

40:02.833 --> 40:04.534
Hey, soda?

40:04.536 --> 40:07.036
Figured we, uh,
order some pizza,

40:07.038 --> 40:08.605
Pull an all-nighter
on this thing,

40:08.607 --> 40:09.939
You know, like the old days.

40:09.941 --> 40:12.942
You know,
normally I'd love to, but...

40:12.944 --> 40:15.478
I think I need to see
someone tonight.

40:15.480 --> 40:17.414
Oh, valentine's.

40:17.416 --> 40:18.648
Ah.

40:18.650 --> 40:19.716
Who's the girl?

40:21.153 --> 40:25.555
I didn't think you went
for the sappy holidays, buddy.

40:25.557 --> 40:27.524
(chuckles)
yeah.

40:27.526 --> 40:29.559
Whoever she is, she's, uh...

40:29.561 --> 40:31.594
She's lucky to have
a guy like you.

40:31.596 --> 40:33.129
You mean that?

40:33.131 --> 40:34.898
Uh-huh. Of course.

40:34.900 --> 40:38.201
There's a reservation
at 8:00 at escala,

40:38.203 --> 40:39.936
In my name, for tomorrow.

40:39.938 --> 40:41.571
You should take her.

40:41.573 --> 40:43.673
Thank you, walter.

40:44.942 --> 40:46.576
Have a good night.
