That's the most
ridiculous idea...

43:35.720 --> 43:37.848
I've ever heard.
Charm the prisoner!

43:38.000 --> 43:40.685
But you must try, Master.
With every passing day...

43:40.800 --> 43:42.802
we become less human.

43:42.920 --> 43:45.207
She's the daughter
of a common thief.

43:45.360 --> 43:46.885
What kind of person do you
think that makes her?

43:47.000 --> 43:48.843
Oh, you can't judge people...

43:48.920 --> 43:51.161
by who their father is,
now can you?

43:55.640 --> 43:57.210
You'll join me for dinner.

43:57.360 --> 43:58.691
That's not a request.

43:58.840 --> 44:00.171
Gently, Master.

44:00.280 --> 44:01.805
The girl lost her father...

44:01.880 --> 44:03.689
and her freedom in one day.

44:03.840 --> 44:06.525
Yes, the poor thing is probably in there,
scared to death.

44:06.680 --> 44:07.841
MRS. POTTS: Exactly.

44:16.520 --> 44:18.204
Just a minute.

44:18.320 --> 44:21.767
You see? There she is.
Now, remember, be gentle.

44:21.920 --> 44:23.843
- Kind!
- Charming!

44:23.920 --> 44:24.728
Sweet!

44:24.800 --> 44:26.211
And when she opens the door,

44:26.280 --> 44:29.090
give her a dashing,
debonair smile.

44:29.200 --> 44:30.531
Come, come. Show me the smile.

44:32.040 --> 44:33.201
- Oh, <i>mon dieu!</i>
- Oh, no.

44:38.720 --> 44:41.041
Will you join me for dinner?

44:43.760 --> 44:45.364
You've taken me
as your prisoner

44:45.440 --> 44:47.727
and now you want
to have dinner with me?

44:48.280 --> 44:49.566
Are you insane?

44:50.360 --> 44:52.408
- (GRUNTING)
- Uh-oh. He's losing it.

44:52.520 --> 44:53.931
Oh, dear!

44:56.560 --> 44:58.801
I told you
to join me for dinner.

44:58.920 --> 45:00.410
And I told you no.

45:00.680 --> 45:03.126
Ooh! What time is it?

45:03.240 --> 45:04.366
What's happening?

45:04.520 --> 45:07.524
I'd starve before
I ever ate with you.

45:07.640 --> 45:08.880
Well, be my guest.

45:08.960 --> 45:10.724
Go ahead and starve.

45:12.720 --> 45:14.210
If she doesn't eat with me...

45:14.280 --> 45:15.725
then she doesn't eat at all.

45:16.560 --> 45:17.721
Idiots!

45:19.240 --> 45:21.686
You can't talk to us
like that. I forbid it.

45:22.080 --> 45:24.765
Uh... Oh. Am I too late?

45:24.920 --> 45:27.446
Shame, I was really going to
tell him off this time.

45:27.600 --> 45:29.682
Oh, Master, you've returned.

45:29.760 --> 45:31.683
- (EXCLAIMS)
- (LAUGHS)

45:31.840 --> 45:33.683
- Oh, very funny.
- I got you there.

45:53.240 --> 45:54.924
Show me the girl.

46:25.320 --> 46:27.368
(RUMBLING)

46:31.400 --> 46:32.686
Another petal fell.

46:32.840 --> 46:33.648
Lumière...

46:34.520 --> 46:37.842
I grew three more feathers.
And I just plucked yesterday.

46:37.960 --> 46:40.008
I know, darling.
(EXCLAIMS)

46:40.680 --> 46:43.524
I'm getting more
metallic every day.

46:43.600 --> 46:47.764
Oh, no. It's happening again.
Pardon me.

46:47.920 --> 46:49.922
Oh, everyone, calm yourselves.

46:50.080 --> 46:53.084
- We still have time.
- Mama...

46:53.200 --> 46:55.601
am I ever going
to be a boy again?

46:55.680 --> 46:58.251
Oh, yes, Chip.
You'll have your days...

46:58.360 --> 47:01.170
in the sun again.
You just leave it to me.

47:08.240 --> 47:09.241
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

47:11.200 --> 47:12.884
I told you to go away.

47:13.000 --> 47:15.810
Don't worry, dear.
It's only Mrs. Potts.

47:24.720 --> 47:25.721
Oh!

47:25.960 --> 47:27.485
Oh, aren't you a vision!

47:27.640 --> 47:28.641
How lovely...

47:28.720 --> 47:31.007
to make your acquaintance.

47:33.880 --> 47:37.248
It's a very long journey.
Let me fix you up...

47:37.320 --> 47:38.685
before you go.

47:38.840 --> 47:39.966
I have found...

47:40.080 --> 47:42.526
that most troubles
seem less troubling...

47:42.600 --> 47:45.683
after a bracing cup of tea.

47:45.800 --> 47:47.290
Slowly now, Chip.

47:52.400 --> 47:53.401
(CHIP GIGGLES)

47:54.240 --> 47:55.241
Pleased to meet you.

47:56.280 --> 47:57.691
Wanna see me do a trick?

47:59.520 --> 48:00.123
Chip!

48:01.080 --> 48:05.165
That was a very brave thing
you did for your father, dearie.

48:05.360 --> 48:06.930
Yes.

48:07.000 --> 48:08.570
We all think so.

48:08.720 --> 48:09.926
I'm worried about him.

48:10.600 --> 48:13.046
He's never been on his own.

48:13.240 --> 48:14.924
Cheer up, my poppet.

48:15.120 --> 48:17.441
Things will turn out
in the end.

48:17.520 --> 48:18.851
You'll feel a lot better...

48:18.920 --> 48:20.365
after dinner.

48:20.520 --> 48:22.249
But he said,
"If she doesn't eat with me,

48:22.320 --> 48:23.731
then she doesn't eat at all."

48:24.160 --> 48:26.640
Mmm, people say
a lot of things in anger.

48:26.760 --> 48:28.728
It is our choice
whether or not to listen.

48:29.280 --> 48:30.361
You coming, poppet?

48:30.960 --> 48:31.927
Go!

48:32.560 --> 48:35.370
They are coming. Final checks,
everyone! <i>Tout de suite!</i>

48:35.520 --> 48:36.442
No, you don't!

48:36.640 --> 48:38.483
If the master finds out
you violated his orders

48:38.600 --> 48:40.090
and fed her he will blame me!

48:40.240 --> 48:41.571
Yes, I will make sure of it.

48:41.640 --> 48:43.369
But did you see her
stand up to him?

48:43.480 --> 48:45.244
I am telling you,
this girl is the one.

48:45.440 --> 48:47.442
They must fall in love
if we are to be human again...

48:47.600 --> 48:49.648
and how can they fall in love
if she stays in her room?

48:49.800 --> 48:51.484
Hey, Chapeau,
you missed a spot.

48:51.640 --> 48:53.130
You know
she'll never love him.

48:53.320 --> 48:56.244
A broken clock is right
two times a day, <i>mon ami...</i>

48:56.320 --> 48:57.970
but this is not one of those times.
Stand up straight!

48:58.160 --> 48:59.764
It's time to sparkle!

48:59.920 --> 49:01.649
Mmm! I have no taste buds,

49:01.720 --> 49:03.245
but I can tell this is exquisite.

49:03.400 --> 49:05.164
Off! Off me while I work!

Pepper, get cracking!
Salt, shake a leg!

49:07.560 --> 49:10.484
Not so loud! Keep it down.

Of course, of course!
But what is dinner...

49:12.880 --> 49:14.484

your wife is upstairs...

49:34.600 --> 49:37.001

She's counting on you
to help us break this curse.

Then I shall
play through the dental pain.

49:43.320 --> 49:45.846
Maestro, play quietly, please.

Oh, quietly.

<i>She will still inspire me</i>

02:08:11.240 --> 02:08:16.849
<i>Be a part of everything I do</i>

02:08:17.720 --> 02:08:22.009
<i>Wasting in my lonely tower</i>

02:08:22.440 --> 02:08:27.128
<i>Waiting by an open door</i>

02:08:27.280 --> 02:08:30.966
<i>I'll fool myself she'll walk right in</i>

02:08:31.760 --> 02:08:35.401
<i>And as the long, long nights begin</i>

02:08:36.160 --> 02:08:39.926
<i>I'll think of all that might have been</i>

02:08:40.080 --> 02:08:47.089
<i>Waiting here for evermore</i>
