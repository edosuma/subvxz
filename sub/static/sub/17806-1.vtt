WEBVTT

01:39.391 --> 01:43.185
Our state fair is a
great state fair

01:43.186 --> 01:47.106
Don't miss it
Don't even be late

01:47.107 --> 01:51.027
It's dollars to doughnuts
that our state fair

01:51.028 --> 01:55.529
Is the best state fair in our state

02:02.497 --> 02:06.125
Our state fair is a
great state fair

02:06.126 --> 02:10.211
Don't miss it
Don't even be late

02:10.213 --> 02:13.883
It's dollars to doughnuts
that our state fair

02:13.884 --> 02:18.385
Is the best state fair in our state

02:25.479 --> 02:30.066
Take it easy, Blue Boy. Your
supper will be here any minute.

02:30.067 --> 02:32.611
I wish I knew what was
keeping that feller.

02:34.488 --> 02:38.240
Our state fair is a
great state fair

02:38.241 --> 02:42.328
Don't miss it
Don't even be late

02:42.329 --> 02:46.082
It's dollars to doughnuts
that our state fair

02:46.083 --> 02:50.753
Is the best state fair in our state

02:50.754 --> 02:55.424
Dad! Daddy, I just had
Mr. Cramer on the phone.

02:55.425 --> 02:58.094
He said Dave Miller stopped
by his place 10 minutes ago

02:58.095 --> 03:00.514
- to put water in his radiator.
- Thanks, daughter.

03:01.431 --> 03:03.474
Margy?

03:04.518 --> 03:08.437
- Have you finished your packing?
- Not yet. I was just going to.

03:08.438 --> 03:11.941
I don't know what's got into you lately.
All you do is sit around and mope.

03:11.942 --> 03:13.734
I don't sit around and mope.

03:13.735 --> 03:16.939
Well, stop moping now and
finish your packing.

03:22.119 --> 03:25.621
Always saying she doesn't
know what's got into me.

03:25.622 --> 03:28.082
I'll be glad to get to the fair,

03:28.083 --> 03:32.754
hear something different, see
something different for a change.

03:53.316 --> 03:56.565
What has got into me, anyway?

04:18.884 --> 04:22.219
The things I used to like

04:22.220 --> 04:25.306
I don't like anymore

04:25.307 --> 04:28.058
I want a lot of other things

04:28.059 --> 04:31.520
I've never had before

04:31.521 --> 04:36.484
It's just like Mother says

04:36.485 --> 04:40.565
I sit around and mope

04:41.782 --> 04:47.578
Pretending I am wonderful

04:47.579 --> 04:52.330
And knowing I'm a dope

04:55.128 --> 04:57.379
- Margy?
- Yes, Mother?

04:57.380 --> 05:00.781
As soon as you're finished, I want you to
come down and help me with the pickles.

05:01.176 --> 05:03.385
In a minute, Mother.

05:03.386 --> 05:05.088
Pickles!

05:06.097 --> 05:09.642
I'm as restless as a willow

05:09.643 --> 05:12.436
In a windstorm

05:12.437 --> 05:15.648
I'm as jumpy as a puppet

05:15.649 --> 05:18.317
On a string

05:18.318 --> 05:24.073
I'd say that I had spring fever

05:24.074 --> 05:30.162
But I know it isn't spring

05:30.163 --> 05:36.293
I'm starry-eyed and
vaguely discontented

05:36.294 --> 05:42.424
Like a nightingale
without a song to sing

05:42.425 --> 05:48.430
Oh, why should I have spring fever

05:48.431 --> 05:55.020
When it isn't even spring

05:55.021 --> 06:00.818
I keep wishing
I were somewhere else

06:00.819 --> 06:06.740
Walking down a strange, new street

06:06.741 --> 06:12.788
Hearing words that
I have never heard

06:12.789 --> 06:19.838
From a man I've yet to meet

06:20.297 --> 06:23.841
I'm as busy as a spider

06:23.842 --> 06:26.677
Spinning daydreams

06:26.678 --> 06:32.641
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

06:32.642 --> 06:38.314
I haven't seen a
crocus or a rosebud

06:38.315 --> 06:44.028
Ora robin on the wing

06:44.029 --> 06:48.282
But I feel so gay

06:48.283 --> 06:52.328
In a melancholy way

06:52.329 --> 06:59.378
That it might as well be spring

06:59.711 --> 07:06.886
It might as well be

07:07.052 --> 07:10.426
Spring

07:17.187 --> 07:19.139
Margy!

07:19.314 --> 07:21.232
I'm coming, Mother.

07:22.859 --> 07:25.153
Come on, boy.

07:28.365 --> 07:31.617
Ah, he'll win first this year sure.

07:31.618 --> 07:33.786
He's half again the hog
he was last year.

07:33.787 --> 07:38.707
You don't really expect to win, do
you, with that animated lard can?

07:38.708 --> 07:41.752
Say, listen, you can say
anything you please about me,

07:41.753 --> 07:44.463
but don't say anything bad
about Blue Boy.

07:44.464 --> 07:47.716
That's the finest Hampshire
boar that ever breathed.

07:47.717 --> 07:50.921
If you think that, he's
just as good as beat now.

07:51.304 --> 07:52.888
Be better if he was
third or fourth best.

07:52.889 --> 07:55.975
- He'd stand a better chance.
- What are you talking about?

07:55.976 --> 08:01.063
If a hog or a man ever got what
he was entitled to just once,

08:01.064 --> 08:04.024
the eternal stars would quit
making melody in the spheres.

08:04.025 --> 08:07.361
Oh, there you go
with that book talk again.

08:07.362 --> 08:11.031
I say he's the best hog in the state,
and the judges will say so too.

08:11.032 --> 08:13.951
They might.
But if that turns out good,

08:13.952 --> 08:16.578
then something else
will probably happen.

08:16.579 --> 08:18.664
- He might catch pneumonia...
- Oh!

08:18.665 --> 08:21.458
or hog cholera,
or you might catch pneumonia.

08:21.459 --> 08:23.085
Or something might happen
to Wayne or Margy.

08:23.086 --> 08:24.294
Oh!

08:24.295 --> 08:27.881
Mark my words, Abel, there's
compensation in this world.

08:27.882 --> 08:32.594
For every good, there's bad. Now,
Ralph Waldo Emerson tells us...

08:32.595 --> 08:35.931
I don't care what
Waldo Emerson tells us!

08:35.932 --> 08:38.350
Look, I'll just make
a little bet with you.

08:38.351 --> 08:40.894
- On what?
- I'll bet you we go to the fair...

08:40.895 --> 08:43.313
and Blue Boy
will win the grand award.

08:43.313 --> 08:46.942
And nothing bad will happen
to him, me or my family.

08:46.943 --> 08:49.153
Yes, and we'll all have
a good time too

08:49.154 --> 08:51.780
and be better off for it
after the fair is over.

08:51.781 --> 08:56.368
It's a foolish bet, Abel. If you'd
asked me, I'd have given you 10-to-1.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.996
But you didn't ask me,
so it's an even bet.

08:58.997 --> 09:03.418
- Five dollars?
- Five dollars is right.

09:04.127 --> 09:06.962
I'll be around for the money
the day you get back.

09:06.963 --> 09:10.466
- Be around with the money, you mean.
- You'll see. You'll see.

09:10.467 --> 09:13.927
Yeah, I'll see.
Well, well, what's this?

09:13.928 --> 09:16.764
You got your chains on.
You expecting a shower?

09:16.765 --> 09:19.141
Nope. I'm expecting good weather.

09:19.142 --> 09:23.017
That's why I put my chains on,
so I wouldn't be fooled.

09:28.485 --> 09:31.487
Do you want your name "Mrs. Abel
Frake" or "Mrs. Melissa Frake"?

09:31.488 --> 09:34.031
Melissa Frake, I guess. With
your father entering Blue Boy,

09:34.032 --> 09:35.859
the judges might get us mixed.

09:37.410 --> 09:39.995
Hog cholera, pneumonia.

09:39.996 --> 09:42.998
He left out earthquakes,
the old gloom spreader.

09:42.999 --> 09:45.247
Poor Dad.

09:47.378 --> 09:49.713
Mmm, I don't know.

09:49.714 --> 09:52.042
Let me taste.

09:55.011 --> 09:58.055
- Don't taste like Grandma Stidger's.
- I followed her recipe.

10:00.141 --> 10:03.268
- I'll get it.
- You left something out.

10:03.269 --> 10:07.189
Abel Frake, I am not gonna
put liquor into my cooking!

10:07.190 --> 10:10.234
Making mincemeat without brandy?
No such thing.

10:10.235 --> 10:12.402
I don't approve of it,
and I won't do it.

10:12.403 --> 10:15.280
Well, you'll be sorry. You know,
those judges at the fair,

10:15.281 --> 10:17.199
they like a little snifter
now and then.

10:17.200 --> 10:19.451
- It's Eleanor, for Wayne.
- Wayne's out back somewhere.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.746
I'll find him.

10:26.376 --> 10:28.710
Why don't you say hello
to Eleanor, Ma?

10:28.711 --> 10:31.421
See how her mother is. You know, they
had the doctor again this morning.

10:31.422 --> 10:34.466
- I suppose I should.
- Find out if she's going to the fair.

10:34.467 --> 10:36.761
Yes, I will.

10:39.556 --> 10:42.724
Hello, Eleanor. How are you, dear?

10:42.725 --> 10:45.227
How's your mother feeling?

10:45.228 --> 10:49.439
Yes, I know. I'm sorry I couldn't
get by to see her today,

10:49.440 --> 10:53.315
but I've been so busy getting
ready to leave and all.

10:54.445 --> 10:56.572
Oh, well, I'm glad
she's better, dear.

10:56.573 --> 10:58.574
Wayne'll be here any moment.
Just hold on.

10:58.575 --> 11:01.827
And be sure to give
my love to your mother.

11:01.828 --> 11:04.872
Thank you, dear. Good-bye.

11:06.791 --> 11:08.125
- Abel?
- Hmm?

11:08.126 --> 11:11.336
I need a good-sized box, or cotton.
Something to carry my pickles in.

11:11.337 --> 11:15.542
Know just what you want, Ma.
I'll get it for you right away.

11:23.474 --> 11:27.686
"Stir in apples and molasses,
spices, lemons..."

11:27.687 --> 11:30.766
"Two parts good brandy."

11:37.697 --> 11:39.240
No, I won't!

11:41.117 --> 11:45.117
- Eph, where's Wayne?
- Wayne? He's back there in the barn.

11:46.873 --> 11:48.325
Thank you, mister.

11:48.708 --> 11:51.460
And now, I think I'll have a
try at that fancy brass clock.

11:51.461 --> 11:53.834
Yes, that one.

11:56.466 --> 11:58.425
- There ya are.
- Wayne?

11:58.426 --> 12:01.011
There's a nice string of pearls.
I think I'll have a go at them.

12:01.012 --> 12:04.091
- Oh, I know they're fakes, but...
- Wayne!

12:04.557 --> 12:07.226
What are you doing?

12:07.227 --> 12:10.312
- How long you been there?
- Just a little while.

12:10.313 --> 12:12.981
Why didn't you say somethin'
instead of just standing there?

12:12.982 --> 12:14.566
Who were you talking to?

12:14.567 --> 12:17.069
And does Mother know you have
her embroidery hoops out here?

12:17.070 --> 12:21.240
Look, just leave me alone, will ya?
And stop prying in other people's affairs.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.992
Speaking of affairs,
Eleanor's on the phone.

12:23.993 --> 12:27.197
Eleanor? Well, Christmas!
Why didn't you tell me?

12:41.219 --> 12:43.547
Eleanor's on the phone.

12:54.357 --> 12:59.236
Hello, Eleanor? Hi, honey. What'd the
doctor say about your mother? Can you go?

12:59.237 --> 13:01.488
Well, I don't know
what to do, Wayne.

13:01.489 --> 13:03.615
The doctor said she's
a little better, but...

13:03.616 --> 13:05.909
Oh, but, Eleanor, you've got to go!

13:05.910 --> 13:10.331
I've made a lot
of plans for us. What?

13:28.641 --> 13:34.563
I keep wishing
I were somewhere else

13:34.564 --> 13:40.861
Walking down a strange, new street

13:40.862 --> 13:46.867
Hearing words
that I have never heard

13:46.868 --> 13:48.952
From a man

13:48.953 --> 13:54.541
I've yet to meet

13:54.542 --> 14:01.590
He would be a kind
of handsome combination

14:01.591 --> 14:05.761
Of Ronald Colman Charles Boyer

14:05.762 --> 14:09.307
And Bing

14:10.641 --> 14:13.101
Margy. My dear, little Margy.

14:13.102 --> 14:18.315
I'd make the world a ruby for
your little finger and say,

14:18.316 --> 14:24.154
"I love you.
I love you. I love you."

14:24.155 --> 14:27.616
Ah, Margy. You are beautiful.

14:27.617 --> 14:30.619
You are so very beautiful.

14:30.620 --> 14:34.373
And we feel so gay

14:34.374 --> 14:37.209
In a melancholy way

14:37.210 --> 14:43.508
That it might as well be spring

14:57.980 --> 15:00.182
Margy!

15:02.443 --> 15:06.773
- Hello, Margy.
- Hello, Harry.

15:07.657 --> 15:11.493
No, I'm not mad.
I'm just disappointed.

15:11.494 --> 15:14.955
Well, I'll see you when I get back.

15:14.956 --> 15:16.533
Good-bye.

15:18.543 --> 15:21.336
Gee, I wish I was going to
the fair with you tonight.

15:21.337 --> 15:23.672
I'd rather be doing that
than anything I know.

15:23.673 --> 15:26.675
- Oh, would you, Harry?
- Well, sure.

15:26.676 --> 15:30.847
- Only I can't neglect my cows.
- Oh. Of course not.

15:31.597 --> 15:34.850
- Say, I saw something today.
- What?

15:34.851 --> 15:38.019
The sweetest bit of farmland
this side of Davenport.

15:38.020 --> 15:41.064
I was thinking of puttin' a
bid in on it if you like it.

15:41.065 --> 15:43.859
- If I like it?
- Well, sure.

15:43.860 --> 15:48.572
You know I haven't made a plan since I was
12 years old that didn't include you.

15:48.573 --> 15:51.324
- Got a house on it?
- Yeah, but it's too old.

15:51.325 --> 15:54.202
- We'd have to build a new one.
- Oh, I like old houses.

15:54.203 --> 15:56.580
It wouldn't fit in
with our kind of farm.

15:56.581 --> 16:01.418
You know, I plan to do everything my
old man won't let me do on his place.

16:01.419 --> 16:05.839
Scientific irrigation, electric
milking, separate hen roosts.

16:05.840 --> 16:08.717
No horses. All tractor power.

16:08.718 --> 16:11.970
- You see what I mean? Everything modern.
- But the house you live in...

16:11.971 --> 16:16.308
It's gotta be the same. No
clapboard and shingle business.

16:16.309 --> 16:19.019
There's a new kind of
plastic, prefabricated job.

16:19.020 --> 16:21.813
I want you to see it.
Got the catalog at home.

16:21.814 --> 16:24.149
- Is it pretty?
- Sure!

16:24.150 --> 16:28.487
But what's more important,
it's termite-proof.

16:28.488 --> 16:31.156
Wait till you see it. And they
tell you how to furnish it too.

16:31.157 --> 16:34.117
No rugs or carpets.
They're just dust collectors.

16:34.118 --> 16:38.622
- What's on the floor?
- Linoleum through the whole house.

16:38.623 --> 16:44.169
Wait till you see the pictures. It's slick
and smooth and easy to keep clean.

16:44.170 --> 16:47.422
Well, it's like every room
in the house was a bathroom.

16:47.423 --> 16:50.175
- Sounds real cozy.
- Yeah, don't it, though?

16:50.176 --> 16:53.553
- What I've always wanted.
- Oh, sure. It's the only way to live.

16:53.554 --> 16:55.847
- Everything's sanitary.
- Sure.

16:55.848 --> 16:58.517
- And if we had children...
- Oh, Margy!

16:58.518 --> 17:01.228
I said if by any strange
chance we had children,

17:01.229 --> 17:03.939
why, I could dress them
in cellophane rompers.

17:03.940 --> 17:06.358
Say, I didn't know they had...

17:06.358 --> 17:08.902
Life will just be ducky...

17:08.903 --> 17:13.281
In our air-conditioned
patent-leather farmhouse

17:13.281 --> 17:14.532
Plastic.

17:14.534 --> 17:19.704
On our ultramodern scientific farm

17:19.704 --> 17:24.709
We'll live in a streamlined heaven

17:24.710 --> 17:29.714
And we'll waste no time on charm

17:29.715 --> 17:35.220
No geraniums to clutter our veranda

17:35.221 --> 17:40.475
Nor a single, little
sentimental thing

17:40.476 --> 17:45.352
No Virginia creepers
Nothing useless

17:49.735 --> 17:52.487
- What's the matter, honey?
- Oh, nothing.

17:52.488 --> 17:55.073
Just restless, I guess.

17:55.074 --> 17:58.201
Sure. I understand.
You like to travel.

17:58.202 --> 18:02.080
Well, I figured we'd make a little
trip, California or Bermuda or...

18:02.081 --> 18:04.749
if it was May, we could go to
Washington, see the cherry trees.

18:04.750 --> 18:07.586
- A honeymoon?
- That's what.

18:07.587 --> 18:10.130
I'd almost marry you
to make the trip, Harry.

18:10.131 --> 18:15.176
No kiddin' now, Margy. What do
you say? What do you say?

18:15.177 --> 18:19.639
Well, I won't say anything
just now, Harry.

18:19.640 --> 18:22.935
- Well, after the fair, maybe?
- Maybe.

18:24.979 --> 18:26.726
Wow!

18:28.232 --> 18:30.434
Look at him, Marge!

18:32.903 --> 18:36.949
Holy cow! Gets bigger
every time I see him.

18:38.242 --> 18:40.452
Biggest boar in the world, I bet.

18:40.453 --> 18:43.076
All depends on how you spell it.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.764
Eleanor can't go.

19:20.743 --> 19:23.453
- Where's your mincemeat, Ma?
- Right here between my feet.

19:23.454 --> 19:27.624
- Is the top on tight?
- Certainly, it's on tight.

19:27.625 --> 19:29.959
- Why?
- Oh, nothin'.

19:29.960 --> 19:33.084
Just don't want the flavor
to escape, that's all.

20:24.014 --> 20:26.641
- Hello, Miss Frake!
- Hello, there!

20:26.642 --> 20:28.685
- How are you?
- Just fine.

20:28.686 --> 20:30.395
We'll come see you as
soon as we get settled.

20:30.396 --> 20:32.223
Yes, do that.

20:35.484 --> 20:39.530
If Wayne doesn't come back soon to
take me around, I'm going by myself.

20:40.865 --> 20:43.324
I do wish your father
would come to his breakfast.

20:43.325 --> 20:45.744
If he'd rather stay with Blue
Boy than eat, well, let him.

20:45.745 --> 20:48.496
But I've got
my whole day planned out.

20:48.497 --> 20:50.415
Don't you know you can't
plan out a whole day?

20:50.416 --> 20:52.869
- There's no such thing.
- I do it all the time.

20:53.377 --> 20:57.377
You sound just like Harry. He thinks
you can plan out your whole life.

20:57.631 --> 20:59.048
So you can.

20:59.508 --> 21:01.756
Is that what he was
talking about yesterday?

21:02.845 --> 21:04.179
Uh-huh.

21:04.180 --> 21:06.929
Did you come to anything definite?

21:08.017 --> 21:09.058
Uh-uh.

21:09.059 --> 21:12.187
I don't know
what you're waiting for.

21:12.188 --> 21:16.733
It would serve you right if Harry up and
married that Skidmore girl instead of you.

21:16.734 --> 21:18.818
I almost hope he does.

21:18.819 --> 21:20.236
Me too.

21:29.246 --> 21:31.289
Step right up, ladies
and gentlemen.

21:31.290 --> 21:34.375
Move in a little closer.
Don't be afraid.

21:34.376 --> 21:38.546
Hurry, hurry! Play the game!
Three rings for a dime.

21:38.547 --> 21:41.049
Prizes worth up to $20.

21:41.050 --> 21:43.760
Positively no blanks. The prize
you win is the prize you get,

21:43.761 --> 21:45.887
the prize you take away.

21:45.888 --> 21:49.224
Don't any gentleman
want to try his skill?

21:49.225 --> 21:52.143
Ain't nobody here
got the pioneer spirit?

21:52.144 --> 21:54.270
I tell you what I'm going to do.

21:54.271 --> 21:59.484
I'm goin' to put down three nice,
new, crisp one-dollar bills.

21:59.485 --> 22:03.571
One here, one here, and one here.

22:03.572 --> 22:06.908
Now, who will spend a dime
for three chances at $3.00?

22:06.909 --> 22:08.326
Is that real money?

22:08.327 --> 22:10.995
If you win 'em and you
don't like 'em, buddy,

22:10.996 --> 22:13.198
I'll give you
a dollar apiece for 'em.

22:15.417 --> 22:18.419
Hey, mister,
them hoops look mighty small.

22:18.420 --> 22:21.256
- Do they fit over those things?
- Lots of people do it, sir.

22:21.257 --> 22:23.883
- Lots of people do it.
- Yeah, I did it last year.

22:23.884 --> 22:26.094
Remember me? I won a
pearl-handled revolver.

22:26.095 --> 22:28.179
Well, now, there. You see?

22:28.180 --> 22:30.598
Young Mr. Daniel Boone here
won a revolver off me

22:30.599 --> 22:33.518
right at this very fair a year ago.

22:33.519 --> 22:36.563
Bring down any grizzly bears
with that shootin' iron, sonny?

22:36.564 --> 22:39.566
Tell you what I'll do with you.

22:39.567 --> 22:43.736
I'll just give you three rings on
the house to start things off.

22:43.737 --> 22:47.782
Three chances for nothing.
I can't win. I can only lose.

22:47.783 --> 22:50.452
But I love the game.

22:54.415 --> 22:57.417
Remember, young man, you're
enjoying the courtesy of the house.

22:57.418 --> 22:59.495
Don't cost us money.

23:02.506 --> 23:05.300
I just lost $2.00!

23:05.301 --> 23:08.803
But I'm having fun.
I love the game.

23:08.804 --> 23:11.306
Here, my boy. I want you
to have a fair shake.

23:11.307 --> 23:14.142
That ring looks warped.
Try this one.

23:14.143 --> 23:16.471
This one's all right.

23:20.274 --> 23:23.484
Well, well, you all see
how easy it is.

23:23.485 --> 23:26.654
- Who else wants to try?
- I'll try again. Here's a dime.

23:26.655 --> 23:30.283
- Who else wants a chance at a big prize?
- Here, mister, here's my dime.

23:30.284 --> 23:32.827
How about you, sir? You look
like you've got a good aim.

23:32.828 --> 23:35.830
- Why, you got a customer.
- Give me three rings. Here's my dime.

23:35.831 --> 23:39.292
He's trying to dodge the boy!

23:39.293 --> 23:42.712
- All right, buddy. Here ya are.
- You didn't put any dollar bills back.

23:42.713 --> 23:46.799
Ain't pearl necklaces and safety
razors good enough for ya?

23:46.800 --> 23:49.719
Can't you enjoy the game
for the game's sake?

23:49.720 --> 23:52.639
Are ya money mad?

23:52.640 --> 23:55.683
Those prizes are all fakes, but I'll
win 'em anyway just to prove it.

23:55.684 --> 23:57.852
Quite a character.

23:57.853 --> 24:01.314
Step up, folks.
We're havin' fun here.

24:01.315 --> 24:04.692
Just lost a pearl necklace,
but I'm laughing.

24:04.693 --> 24:08.279
I love the game.

24:08.280 --> 24:11.699
Why, the young man
is winnin' a fortune.

24:11.700 --> 24:15.745
- Here you are, buddy.
- Look, pot metal molded in one piece.

24:15.746 --> 24:17.664
What good's a vanity case
it won't even open?

24:17.665 --> 24:19.207
Okay, fella, you had your fun.

24:19.208 --> 24:20.375
Now, come on. Move along.

24:20.376 --> 24:21.918
And those clocks,
they don't have any works.

24:21.919 --> 24:23.044
What good are they?

24:23.045 --> 24:24.963
Listen, kid, you know what
I'm payin' for this pitch?

24:24.964 --> 24:27.173
- No. What?
- More dough than you'll ever see.

24:27.174 --> 24:29.425
So you spend a dime,
take $3.00 in cash

24:29.426 --> 24:31.719
and then try to tell the
public my prizes are no good!

24:31.720 --> 24:33.596
Well, they aren't.
They're just a lot of junk.

24:33.597 --> 24:36.307
Look, you, I've been nice
just long enough.

24:36.308 --> 24:39.769
- Now, beat it, or I'll call a policeman.
- Why don't you?

24:39.770 --> 24:43.815
- What's that?
- I said, why don't you call a policeman?

24:43.816 --> 24:46.067
He's only trying to bluff you.
The law says

24:46.068 --> 24:48.528
he's got to sell you
all the rings you want.

24:48.529 --> 24:51.489
- Otherwise, you can close up his place.
- Oh, a smart dame, huh?

24:51.490 --> 24:54.367
A law student. Now, you listen
to me, Arsenic and Glamour,

24:54.368 --> 24:57.203
- I don't know who you are...
- I'll tell you who I am.

24:57.204 --> 24:59.998
My father's the chief
of police here.

24:59.999 --> 25:02.293
- Your father is...
- The chief of police.

25:02.751 --> 25:05.628
I was standing here
and saw the whole thing.

25:05.629 --> 25:08.965
Say, how did you
get so good at this?

25:08.966 --> 25:12.093
It's kind of a silly thing to be good at,
isn't it? But he made me sore last year.

25:12.094 --> 25:14.429
I was trying for one of those
pearl-handled revolvers.

25:14.430 --> 25:18.433
It cost me about $8.00. When I finally
did win it, it wasn't a revolver at all.

25:18.434 --> 25:22.013
- It wouldn't even shoot. It was just a toy.
- Oh, ho!

25:22.438 --> 25:25.064
- Defrauding the public, huh?
- Now, look, wait a minute.

25:25.065 --> 25:27.942
I wouldn't have minded that so much,
but he kidded me in front of the crowd.

25:27.943 --> 25:31.320
- So I...
- You practiced all year just to get even?

25:31.321 --> 25:33.990
That's right. I figured I'd come back
and make as big a fool out of him

25:33.991 --> 25:36.117
- as he made out of me.
- Oh, no, you don't.

25:36.118 --> 25:38.327
Will you give him $8.00 back
if he promises to lay off?

25:38.328 --> 25:41.289
- Look, you, I don't care who your father is.
- Okay.

25:41.290 --> 25:43.583
Here. Here, here.

25:43.584 --> 25:46.586
Here's your eight bucks,
and you don't come back, see?

25:46.587 --> 25:49.672
- Is it a deal?
- Think it's all right to take it?

25:49.673 --> 25:53.468
Well, sure, it's all right.
Here you are. Good-bye.

25:54.136 --> 25:56.137
Good-bye!

25:56.138 --> 25:59.307
Oh, don't leave, folks.
Prizes up to $20.

25:59.308 --> 26:02.977
- Ah!
- Step right up, ladies and gentlemen!

26:02.978 --> 26:05.188
We're having fun here!

26:05.189 --> 26:07.732
Gee, it was swell of you to stand
up for me like that. Thanks.

26:07.733 --> 26:10.193
Well, that's all right.
He had it coming to him.

26:10.194 --> 26:12.653
Well, uh, now that you helped
me get my money back,

26:12.654 --> 26:13.905
how about helping me spend it?

26:13.906 --> 26:17.158
- No, that won't be necessary.
- What about a frozen custard?

26:17.159 --> 26:19.243
- No, thank you. I believe not.
- Hot dog?

26:19.244 --> 26:21.788
No. Really, I have an appointment.
I'm late already.

26:21.789 --> 26:24.373
Won't I see you again? How about tonight?
Will you be on the midway?

26:24.374 --> 26:27.376
Tonight? Yes, I think so.

26:27.377 --> 26:30.004
I hope so.
I'll sure be looking for you.

26:30.005 --> 26:32.840
- Do that. Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

26:32.841 --> 26:35.401
You sure you won't change your mind?
How about some popcorn?

26:44.269 --> 26:47.563
Get tickets now if
you care to ride.

26:47.564 --> 26:50.191
Train's now ready to leave.

26:50.192 --> 26:52.861
Get your tickets for this ride.

26:53.195 --> 26:56.274
All aboard if you care to ride.

26:56.824 --> 26:59.784
- The train is now...
- One, please.

26:59.785 --> 27:02.995
Please get tickets for this ride.

27:02.996 --> 27:07.291
It's the longest,
the highest, the fastest,

27:07.292 --> 27:10.670
the safest ride at the fairground.

27:10.671 --> 27:13.381
Get tickets now if
you care to ride.

27:13.382 --> 27:15.835
Hey, Pappy, there aren't
any seats together.

27:16.468 --> 27:20.304
Oh. Say, mister, do you mind
sitting in the seat behind?

27:20.305 --> 27:21.597
Thanks a lot.

27:23.851 --> 27:25.098
Thanks.

27:29.731 --> 27:34.983
- All aboard!
- Okay. There they go! Hold your seats.

27:36.864 --> 27:40.944
They're off on a race through
the clouds. A thrill a minute!

27:57.676 --> 27:59.878
Sit down!

28:03.557 --> 28:05.141
What are you trying to do,
get yourself killed?

28:05.142 --> 28:06.309
I'm sorry.

28:09.771 --> 28:11.772
Haven't you ever been on one
of these things before?

28:11.773 --> 28:13.900
Not since I was a little girl.

28:13.901 --> 28:16.694
- I used to be afraid of them.
- But you're not now.

28:16.695 --> 28:19.239
That's what I wanted to find out.

28:28.207 --> 28:30.501
Here comes another dip.

28:44.598 --> 28:48.302
It's nearly over now.
Here's the tunnel.

28:52.397 --> 28:56.522
Johnny, stop that!

29:01.990 --> 29:04.575
Everybody out, folks.
Everybody out.

29:04.576 --> 29:07.578
- I'm going around again.
- You gotta have a ticket.

29:07.579 --> 29:10.414
- Press pass.
- Oh.

29:10.415 --> 29:14.752
- Is the lady going around again too?
- No, thanks. I've had enough.

29:14.753 --> 29:17.797
The safest ride at the fair.

29:17.798 --> 29:21.423
Get tickets now for this ride.

29:25.264 --> 29:28.599
Go and get tickets for this ride.

29:28.600 --> 29:30.726
It is the longest,

29:30.727 --> 29:35.564
fastest thrill ride
at the fairgrounds.

29:35.565 --> 29:39.110
Get tickets now
if you care to ride.

29:42.114 --> 29:44.115
Three rings for a dime. Hurry.

29:44.116 --> 29:47.535
- You feel safer down here?
- Oh!

29:47.536 --> 29:49.620
- I thought you were...
- I changed my mind.

29:49.621 --> 29:51.747
I was standing there
watching you walk away.

29:51.748 --> 29:55.084
Every step you took, your hair bounced
up and down on the back of your neck.

29:55.085 --> 29:58.838
It was really nice. I don't know if
that's what got me, but here I am.

29:58.839 --> 30:01.132
Now it's your turn
to say something.

30:01.133 --> 30:03.592
What can I say? I don't know you.

30:03.593 --> 30:06.304
- I can arrange that.
- And all you know about me

30:06.305 --> 30:09.181
is that my hair bounces
up and down when I walk.

30:09.182 --> 30:12.893
- Everybody's hair bounces up and down.
- Mine doesn't.

30:12.894 --> 30:14.516
I mean, girls.

30:20.360 --> 30:22.779
Well, look over there.

30:27.743 --> 30:31.454
Well, maybe it wasn't your hair. Maybe
it was the way you held your shoulders.

30:31.455 --> 30:34.909
- Walk away again. Let me see.
- All right.

30:41.548 --> 30:44.133
Hey! Hey, wait a minute!

30:44.134 --> 30:46.469
- Where are you going?
- You told me to walk away.

30:46.470 --> 30:48.179
- Yeah, but I...
- Really, I have to go anyway.

30:48.180 --> 30:49.472
- Why?
- Well, I...

30:49.473 --> 30:51.349
Well, what? What are you afraid of?

30:51.350 --> 30:53.351
- I'm not afraid of anything.
- Good.

30:53.352 --> 30:55.603
Then what would be wrong with you
and me sitting down over there

30:55.604 --> 30:56.854
and exchanging our ideas
of life over a Coke?

30:56.855 --> 30:59.106
Nothing wrong. It's just that...

30:59.107 --> 31:01.567
I'm not saying it's a great idea.
I'm just asking what's bad about it.

31:01.568 --> 31:04.288
What could we lose? Let's give it
five minutes. What do you say?

31:10.494 --> 31:13.746
Here we are, two people who
know nothing about each other.

31:13.747 --> 31:18.084
Maybe we should. Maybe it would be
fun to find out what we're like.

31:18.085 --> 31:21.212
- Maybe it'll be dull.
- What do we do if it's dull?

31:21.213 --> 31:24.173
- We break it up.
- How do we do that?

31:24.174 --> 31:26.592
One of us just says, "Let's
break it up." That's the end.

31:26.593 --> 31:29.762
You go east, I go west. No hard
feelings. No questions asked.

31:29.763 --> 31:32.591
- Ag reed?
- Ag reed.

31:33.517 --> 31:36.721
Okay. Here we go.

31:42.567 --> 31:45.270
Hold on! Here we go!

31:58.834 --> 32:04.338
Hearing words
that I have never heard

32:04.339 --> 32:10.387
From a man I've yet to meet

32:14.015 --> 32:16.976
Now, with rolly coasters,
that's different. They're fun.

32:16.977 --> 32:18.602
You oughta see the one in New York.

32:18.603 --> 32:20.187
There's one in Chicago
that's pretty good.

32:20.188 --> 32:21.689
There's one out at
the beach in Los Angeles.

32:21.690 --> 32:24.900
It's not bad, but the one in New York,
the one across the river, that's the one.

32:24.901 --> 32:28.320
- It's got a dip of 200 feet.
- You've been everywhere, haven't you?

32:28.321 --> 32:30.698
Not yet. When I first
started out in this game,

32:30.699 --> 32:32.825
I worked around
on different papers.

32:32.826 --> 32:35.494
But now, I'm afraid the great Des
Moines Register's got me hog-tied.

32:35.495 --> 32:37.538
Someday, I'll work on
a bigger paper though.

32:37.539 --> 32:39.540
I'm sure you will.

32:39.541 --> 32:42.376
Well, I think I'd better go
the rest of the way alone.

32:42.377 --> 32:45.337
I'd have a pretty hard time
explaining you to my folks.

32:45.338 --> 32:48.632
Yeah, I guess you would. Everybody
has a hard time explaining me.

32:48.633 --> 32:51.461
- See you again?
- Well, I...

32:52.053 --> 32:53.471
Or would you like to say,
"Let's break it up"?

32:53.472 --> 32:57.722
Oh, no! Well, I mean, do you?

32:58.226 --> 33:00.644
Look, bobbylocks,
don't worry about me.

33:00.645 --> 33:02.938
Anytime I wanna throw in the
sponge, you'll know it.

33:02.939 --> 33:05.232
I just won't be around.

33:05.233 --> 33:07.985
Well, I don't know what the
family's plans are for tonight.

33:07.986 --> 33:10.112
- I don't know where I'll be.
- I'll find you.

33:10.113 --> 33:12.239
- How?
- I'm a newspaperman.

33:12.240 --> 33:14.909
It's my job to find the right
people at the right time.

33:14.910 --> 33:17.863
You'll be seeing me. So long.

33:18.914 --> 33:20.286
So long.

33:36.973 --> 33:38.641
What's the matter with you?

33:42.270 --> 33:44.605
What's the trouble, Blue Boy?

33:44.606 --> 33:46.399
Ain't you feelin' good?

33:47.859 --> 33:49.944
This ain't like you, son.

33:49.945 --> 33:52.196
- Ain't sick, is he?
- Huh?

33:52.197 --> 33:56.659
Sick? Oh, no, no.
He's in fine shape.

33:56.660 --> 33:59.828
Just had a long trip. Kind of
resting up a bit, that's all.

33:59.829 --> 34:01.997
Oh. I thought he was sick.

34:01.998 --> 34:05.293
Oh, no. He's never
felt better in his life.

34:10.382 --> 34:13.759
You see what a spectacle
you made of yourself?

34:13.760 --> 34:15.969
What are people
gonna say about you?

34:15.971 --> 34:18.304
- Hello, Hank.
- Hello, there.

34:18.306 --> 34:20.349
- What you got this year?
- Never you mind.

34:20.350 --> 34:23.351
She'll put anything you've got
in the shade. You wait and see.

34:23.353 --> 34:26.313
- Come on. Get along, there. Get along.
- Hello, Hank.

34:26.313 --> 34:28.649
Hello, there, Frake. How are ya?

34:28.650 --> 34:30.693
Ah. You got a duroc this time, huh?

34:30.694 --> 34:33.862
- And a good one too. Get in there.
- She's got nice color.

34:33.862 --> 34:36.407
Well, she oughta have.
Her mother before her

34:36.408 --> 34:38.867
was the most beautiful red
sow in the whole world.

34:38.868 --> 34:40.995
- What's her name?
- Esmeralda.

34:40.996 --> 34:44.291
And she'll win the
sweepstakes sure.

35:00.181 --> 35:02.850
Now you look like something.

35:02.851 --> 35:06.103
I don't mind telling you, though,
you had me worried, son,

35:06.104 --> 35:08.188
but I knew you'd come through.

35:08.189 --> 35:10.642
Now you look like a real champion.

35:25.540 --> 35:27.625
- Oh! Excuse me.
- Oh!

35:27.626 --> 35:29.710
Why don't you look where you're goin'?
Gawking around like that,

35:29.711 --> 35:31.795
people'll think you've never
been to a fair before.

35:31.796 --> 35:34.048
I just thought we might meet
somebody we know.

35:34.049 --> 35:37.051
- So what?
- Well, why are you looking around?

35:37.052 --> 35:39.178
Who are you looking for?

35:39.179 --> 35:42.806
I sort of had a half date, with
a guy I met here last year.

35:42.807 --> 35:44.892
- Why don't you keep it?
- What would I do with you?

35:44.893 --> 35:46.977
- Well, look, Wayne...
- I beg your pardon, sir.

35:46.978 --> 35:49.146
- May I trouble you for a match?
- Sure.

35:49.147 --> 35:52.066
- I think I have some right here.
- That's very kind of you.

35:52.067 --> 35:53.314
Okay.

35:54.861 --> 35:57.071
- Here you are. Thanks.
- Why don't you keep them?

35:57.072 --> 36:01.116
- My brother has another pack.
- Sure, sure. Go ahead.

36:01.117 --> 36:04.116
- That's okay.
- Thank you very much.

36:06.081 --> 36:08.624
- You're certainly big with my matches.
- What do you care?

36:08.625 --> 36:11.585
Your pockets are always
full of them.

36:11.586 --> 36:15.339
Look, Wayne, if you really wanna keep your
date with that friend, I wouldn't mind.

36:15.340 --> 36:17.007
- You wouldn't?
- No.

36:17.008 --> 36:19.593
I hardly slept a wink
in that old truck last night.

36:19.594 --> 36:21.762
What I really wanted to do
tonight was to go to bed early

36:21.763 --> 36:23.972
but I didn't wanna disappoint you.

36:23.973 --> 36:26.100
Oh, don't worry about me.

36:26.101 --> 36:28.602
Uh, maybe you'd better.
You do look a little tired.

36:28.603 --> 36:31.438
- And I can get back all right.
- Ah, that's swell, sis.

36:31.439 --> 36:33.774
Thanks. I mean, get
a good rest now.

36:33.775 --> 36:36.023
I will.

36:42.701 --> 36:44.785
Hello.

36:44.786 --> 36:47.788
Take home a beautiful
pennant from the state fair.

36:47.789 --> 36:49.873
Come right over. Help yourself.

36:49.874 --> 36:52.042
Oh, pardon me. I'm looking for
the chief of police's daughter.

36:52.043 --> 36:54.962
- Have you seen her around here anyplace?
- His daughter?

36:54.963 --> 36:57.131
I don't believe I know her.

36:57.132 --> 36:59.372
There's the chief over there.
Why don't you ask him?

37:00.677 --> 37:02.424
Okay. Thank you.

37:08.268 --> 37:11.395
- Good evening, Chief.
- Good evening, son. What can I do for you?

37:11.396 --> 37:12.938
Could you tell me where
your daughter is?

37:12.939 --> 37:14.815
I sort of had a date
to meet her here tonight.

37:14.816 --> 37:17.276
- What?
- Well, it wasn't exactly a date.

37:17.277 --> 37:19.361
She said... I mean, I told her...

37:19.362 --> 37:23.407
Well, let's see.
She's around here somewhere.

37:23.408 --> 37:24.700
Oh, Violet?

37:26.202 --> 37:28.454
Yes, Daddy?

37:28.455 --> 37:32.125
This young gentleman tells me you two
have a date to go out stepping tonight.

37:32.834 --> 37:34.126
Huh?

37:34.127 --> 37:37.421
Well, I guess I must
mean her sister.

37:37.422 --> 37:39.590
I haven't got a sister.

37:41.676 --> 37:44.344
Looks like someone's been
pulling your leg, my boy.

37:44.345 --> 37:47.890
Yeah. That's a pretty good
joke on me, all right.

37:47.891 --> 37:49.092
Well, thanks.

37:49.267 --> 37:51.101
How many, please?

37:51.102 --> 37:52.978
- Huh?
- How many tickets?

37:52.979 --> 37:54.806
Oh. One.

38:21.341 --> 38:23.425
And now for your favorite,

38:23.426 --> 38:27.551
the lovely Emily Edwards,
and That's For Me.

38:34.229 --> 38:36.730
Right

38:36.731 --> 38:41.902
Between the eyes

38:41.903 --> 38:45.405
Quite a belt

38:45.406 --> 38:49.743
That blow I felt this morning

38:49.744 --> 38:52.079
Fate

38:52.080 --> 38:57.376
Gave me no warning

38:57.377 --> 39:00.087
Great

39:00.088 --> 39:03.423
Was my surprise

39:03.424 --> 39:08.262
I saw you standing in the sun

39:08.263 --> 39:12.891
And you were something to see

39:12.892 --> 39:17.104
I know what I like
and I liked what I saw

39:17.105 --> 39:23.278
And I said to myself that's for me

39:24.612 --> 39:28.115
A lovely morning I remarked

39:28.116 --> 39:32.744
And you were quick to agree

39:32.745 --> 39:36.623
You wanted to walk
and I nodded my head

39:36.624 --> 39:39.084
As I breathlessly said

39:39.085 --> 39:43.422
That's for me

39:43.423 --> 39:48.176
I left you standing under stars

39:48.177 --> 39:52.598
The day's adventures are through

39:52.599 --> 39:56.643
There's nothing for me
but the dream in my heart

39:56.644 --> 39:58.770
And the dream in my heart

39:58.771 --> 40:03.692
That's for you

40:03.693 --> 40:06.403
Oh, my darling

40:06.404 --> 40:10.654
That's for you

40:16.164 --> 40:18.332
- There you are.
- Thank you.

40:19.792 --> 40:22.878
- Who's that singing?
- That's Emily Edwards.

40:22.879 --> 40:25.923
She's kind of cute,
but she's not my type.

40:25.924 --> 40:28.634
She's a redhead.

40:28.635 --> 40:31.470
Now, with brown hair,
that's different.

40:31.471 --> 40:33.472
- Hello, Pat.
- Hi, Pat.

40:33.473 --> 40:35.557
- Hi, girls.
- How are you doin', honey?

40:35.558 --> 40:39.513
- Quiet, you.
- I guess you know a lot of girls, don't you?

40:39.771 --> 40:41.563
Well, in my racket, you know...

40:41.564 --> 40:47.737
For you

41:02.460 --> 41:06.463
- I, uh, just spoke to your father.
- My who?

41:06.464 --> 41:08.924
Your father. You know,
the chief of police.

41:08.925 --> 41:11.969
Oh, that. Didn't you know
I was kidding?

41:11.970 --> 41:14.054
Well, I do now.

41:14.055 --> 41:17.350
And just for that, you're gonna
have to have a drink with me.

41:20.770 --> 41:23.522
When I first saw you up there,
I couldn't believe you were the same girl.

41:23.523 --> 41:24.898
Why not? Was I that bad?

41:24.899 --> 41:28.318
I didn't mean it that way.
You were good, wonderful.

41:28.319 --> 41:32.656
That's just it. A girl singer like
you with Tommy Thomas's band,

41:32.657 --> 41:35.826
I couldn't figure out why you went
to all that trouble today just for me.

41:35.827 --> 41:40.330
- Why shouldn't I? What's wrong with you?
- Oh, nothing wrong with me.

41:40.331 --> 41:43.205
I mean, well, maybe there is,
but don't tell me.

41:44.877 --> 41:47.626
- Like to dance?
- Uh-huh. Do you?

41:48.423 --> 41:53.220
Sure. That's why
I brought it up. Sure.

41:53.720 --> 41:55.968
- We can get our drinks later.
- All right.

41:58.808 --> 42:01.727
The big feature ride of the fair.

42:01.728 --> 42:05.063
Get your tickets for the next ride.

42:05.064 --> 42:10.777
This is the highest, fastest,
safest ride at the fairgrounds.

42:10.778 --> 42:14.448
Get tickets now
for the big, fast ride.

42:14.449 --> 42:19.077
- Come on. I dare you.
- I'm game.

42:19.078 --> 42:20.655
- How many?
- Two, please.

42:35.428 --> 42:38.305
- What you thinking about?
- Why?

42:38.306 --> 42:41.099
Oh, you sort of had
a funny smile on your face.

42:41.100 --> 42:43.518
- You really want to know?
- Uh-huh.

42:43.519 --> 42:46.772
Well, I was just thinking about
you practicing all that time

42:46.773 --> 42:50.650
with your mother's embroidery hoops
just to get even with somebody.

42:50.651 --> 42:52.986
I guess you think I'm kind
of screwy, don't you?

42:52.987 --> 42:55.489
No, I don't. I don't at all.

42:55.490 --> 42:58.992
As a matter of fact,
I like that kind of a fellow.

42:58.993 --> 43:02.162
That's lucky for me, because
I like the kind of a girl

43:02.163 --> 43:05.457
who likes that kind of fellow.

43:05.458 --> 43:09.586
It's a grand night for singing

43:09.587 --> 43:12.631
The moon is flying high

43:12.632 --> 43:17.052
And somewhere a bird
who is bound he'll be heard

43:17.053 --> 43:20.680
ls throwing his heart at the sky

43:20.681 --> 43:24.893
It's a grand night for singing

43:24.894 --> 43:28.188
The stars are bright above

43:28.189 --> 43:32.526
The earth is aglow
and to add to the show

43:32.527 --> 43:36.696
I think I am falling in love

43:36.697 --> 43:38.824
Falling

43:38.825 --> 43:42.620
Falling in love

43:43.913 --> 43:48.041
It's a grand night for singing

43:48.042 --> 43:52.045
The stars are bright above

43:52.046 --> 43:55.841
The earth is aglow
and to add to the show

43:55.842 --> 44:00.011
I think I am falling in love

44:00.012 --> 44:06.219
Falling
Falling in love

44:08.229 --> 44:11.731
Maybe it's more than the moon

44:11.732 --> 44:15.485
Maybe it's more than the birds

44:15.486 --> 44:18.905
Maybe it's more
than the sight of the night

44:18.906 --> 44:23.201
In a light too lovely for words

44:23.202 --> 44:27.080
Maybe it's more than the earth

44:27.081 --> 44:30.834
Shiny in silvery blue

44:30.835 --> 44:34.713
Maybe the reason
I'm feeling this way

44:34.714 --> 44:38.049
Has something to do with you

44:39.260 --> 44:43.471
Say, you're pretty good in that
voice department yourself.

44:43.472 --> 44:44.764
I'm an old glee club boy.

44:44.765 --> 44:46.516
The moon is flying high

44:46.517 --> 44:50.145
And somewhere a bird
who is bound he'll be heard

44:50.146 --> 44:53.773
ls throwing his heart at the sky

44:53.774 --> 44:57.944
It's a grand night for singing

44:57.945 --> 45:01.781
The stars are bright above

45:01.782 --> 45:05.660
The earth is aglow
and to add to the show

45:05.661 --> 45:09.873
I think I am falling in love

45:09.874 --> 45:11.958
Falling

45:11.959 --> 45:15.663
Falling in love

45:17.006 --> 45:21.343
It's a grand night for singing

45:21.344 --> 45:25.305
The moon is flying high

45:25.306 --> 45:29.142
And somewhere a bird
who is bound he'll be heard

45:29.143 --> 45:32.687
Is throwing his heart at the sky

45:32.688 --> 45:37.150
It's a grand night for singing

45:37.151 --> 45:40.987
The stars are bright above

45:40.988 --> 45:44.991
The earth is aglow
and to add to the show

45:44.992 --> 45:49.287
I think I am falling in love

45:49.288 --> 45:51.331
Falling

45:51.332 --> 45:57.414
Falling in love

46:09.392 --> 46:13.144
And you were something to see

46:13.145 --> 46:16.189
I know what I like
and I liked what I saw

46:16.190 --> 46:21.695
And I said to myself that's for me

46:21.696 --> 46:24.990
A lovely morning I remarked

46:24.991 --> 46:28.827
And you were quick to agree

46:28.828 --> 46:32.038
You wanted to walk
and I nodded my head

46:32.039 --> 46:35.292
As I breathlessly said

46:35.293 --> 46:39.212
That's for me

46:39.213 --> 46:42.716
I left you standing under stars

46:42.717 --> 46:46.803
- The day's adventures are through
- Ow!

46:46.804 --> 46:49.931
There's nothing for me
but the dream in my heart

46:49.932 --> 46:53.435
And the dream in my heart that's

46:53.436 --> 46:57.731
For you

46:57.732 --> 47:03.486
Oh, my darling

47:03.487 --> 47:07.741
That's

47:07.742 --> 47:11.911
For you

47:11.912 --> 47:14.331
Hey, cut that out!

47:14.332 --> 47:17.584
I'll get you for that. You wait
and see now. You just wait.

47:17.585 --> 47:20.045
You two sound like you had
a wonderful time last night.

47:20.046 --> 47:22.172
- Sure did.
- Mmm, terrific.

47:22.173 --> 47:27.844
Wish your father was enjoying himself
instead of brooding over that old pig.

47:27.845 --> 47:32.349
Say, I thought you were going
to bed early last night.

47:32.350 --> 47:35.268
Oh. Well, I was going to,
but I changed my mind.

47:35.269 --> 47:37.354
I went for a ride
on the roller coaster.

47:37.355 --> 47:41.775
- It's much better than it was last year.
- Oh, okay.

47:41.776 --> 47:44.778
I tell you, he's raring to go.

47:44.779 --> 47:48.406
When I left him just now, he was
strutting around prouder than a peacock.

47:48.407 --> 47:50.450
- You'd think he owned the place.
- Thank goodness.

47:50.451 --> 47:52.619
Maybe now you'll
give me a little time.

47:52.620 --> 47:54.954
Yes, sir, he's all right.
Wait till you see him.

47:54.955 --> 47:58.833
There ain't a hog ever was or
ever will be that can touch him.

47:58.834 --> 48:03.254
For what we're about to receive,
O Lord, make us duly thankful. Amen.

48:03.255 --> 48:05.465
- You said grace before, Daddy.
- Yeah.

48:05.466 --> 48:08.802
I did? Well, I'm going to
keep on saying it all day.

48:08.803 --> 48:12.928
I just hope he stays like he
is till the judges see him!

48:52.096 --> 48:55.974
Why, they hardly tasted them!
And I like my sweet pickles best.

48:55.975 --> 48:58.852
They don't have to taste much.
They're experts.

48:58.853 --> 49:01.431
Don't be so jittery, Mother.

49:03.065 --> 49:05.525
- There's that Mrs. Metcalfe.
- Hmm?

49:05.526 --> 49:08.900
- Behind the lady in the red hat.
- Oh, yes, I see her.

49:11.866 --> 49:14.701
So biggety. Why, she was
just lucky last year.

49:14.702 --> 49:17.412
Her pies weren't
half as good as yours.

49:17.413 --> 49:20.707
- Why, hello, Mrs. Metcalfe. Pardon me.
- Hello.

49:20.708 --> 49:22.876
Going to win all the
prizes again this year?

49:22.877 --> 49:26.754
I don't know about all, but I have high
hopes for my pickles and mincemeat.

49:26.755 --> 49:29.174
Same as you.

49:30.259 --> 49:32.757
Look. They like your sour pickles.

49:58.287 --> 50:01.080
This is the last year I'm
ever gonna enter anything.

50:01.081 --> 50:05.127
- It isn't worth it.
- Oh, Mother, you say that every year.

50:25.439 --> 50:28.813
Please.

50:32.238 --> 50:33.610
Thank you.

50:35.991 --> 50:38.493
Well, aren't they going
to announce their decision?

50:38.494 --> 50:41.163
Not until they finish
with the mincemeat.

50:42.915 --> 50:44.241
Thank you.

50:53.133 --> 50:55.843
I don't remember telling you to
cover this part of the fair.

50:55.844 --> 50:57.345
Hello, boss.

50:57.346 --> 51:01.140
Thought you were specializing in human
interest stories on the midway.

51:01.141 --> 51:03.851
What's wrong with putting in a plug
for the housewives of our state?

51:03.852 --> 51:06.146
That, my friend, is Mrs. America.

51:07.982 --> 51:10.900
Do tell. And what dainty
putter-upper

51:10.901 --> 51:14.237
of what delicious preserve is the
cause of your presence here?

51:14.238 --> 51:18.116
Look, forget you're the managing editor of
a newspaper and try to act intelligent.

51:18.117 --> 51:20.868
Have you ever seen me with
the type who's a good cook?

51:20.869 --> 51:22.996
No, but I've seen you
with every other kind.

51:22.997 --> 51:25.290
You had to get around
to these sometime.

51:25.291 --> 51:28.251
Shove off. Let me finish this
story. It's for your paper.

51:28.252 --> 51:31.879
Sure. Only I hope it's better than
the one you turned in last night,

51:31.880 --> 51:34.799
"Fun on a Roller Coaster." Ouch.

51:34.800 --> 51:37.468
Boy, you'd better hope
the old man misses that one

51:37.469 --> 51:40.218
or he'll never give you a
shot at that job in Chicago.

51:47.396 --> 51:49.564
That's yours, isn't it?

52:18.552 --> 52:20.880
Mmm.

52:40.032 --> 52:41.616
Do you think they liked it?

52:41.617 --> 52:44.118
They must have. They
certainly ate enough.

52:44.119 --> 52:47.288
Your attention, please.

52:47.289 --> 52:49.582
Silence, please.

52:49.583 --> 52:52.794
ladies and gentlemen.

52:52.795 --> 52:54.713
Quiet, please!

52:56.090 --> 53:01.842
We are now ready to announce
the awards. Sweet pickles.

53:03.263 --> 53:08.936
First prize to Mrs. Edwin
Metcalfe of Pottsville.

53:15.526 --> 53:19.278
Second prize to...

53:19.279 --> 53:21.572
To Mrs. Agnes Field

53:21.573 --> 53:23.867
of Arcadia.

53:25.828 --> 53:28.030
Sour pickles.

53:28.747 --> 53:31.416
First prize to

53:31.417 --> 53:35.920
Mrs. Melissa Frake of Brunswick.

53:35.921 --> 53:38.499
Oh, Mother.

53:42.761 --> 53:48.684
Second prize to
Mrs. Edwin Metcalfe.

53:53.814 --> 53:57.108
And now, ladies and gentlemen...

53:57.109 --> 54:00.695
Quiet, please. As you know,

54:00.696 --> 54:05.324
we occasionally give a plaque
for distinguished achievement.

54:05.325 --> 54:09.162
As you are doubtlessly aware,

54:09.163 --> 54:13.332
this plaque is only given
in rare cases.

54:13.333 --> 54:16.461
And on this occasion,
my colleagues and I

54:16.462 --> 54:18.671
have voted unanimously

54:18.672 --> 54:23.134
that it be given to a lady who has
concocted the most delicious,

54:23.135 --> 54:27.764
the most succulent
and spiciest mincemeat

54:27.765 --> 54:30.516
ever entered in a state fair.

54:30.517 --> 54:34.437
The lady who wins this distinction

54:34.438 --> 54:40.276
is none other than Mrs.
Melissa Frake of Brunswick.

54:40.277 --> 54:44.527
- Oh, Mother! Oh!
- Congratulations. I'm so glad.

54:49.453 --> 54:52.789
I've got the most a woman
can get in life, Margy.

54:52.790 --> 54:56.745
- If I think any more about it, I'll cry.
- Stand where you are, please.

54:57.878 --> 55:00.588
Hold it. Thank you.

55:00.589 --> 55:01.964
Thank you very much, ladies.

55:01.965 --> 55:04.175
Your picture will appear in the
Register tomorrow morning.

55:04.176 --> 55:06.052
Good day.

55:06.053 --> 55:09.430
- See, Mother? You're famous.
- I'm worn out.

55:09.431 --> 55:11.599
I'm going up to the trailer
and lie down.

55:11.600 --> 55:15.228
I never knew what a strain it was
to get something you really wanted.

55:15.229 --> 55:17.396
- I'll take these, dear.
- Oh, my hat too.

55:17.397 --> 55:20.441
Now you run along
and enjoy yourself.

55:30.619 --> 55:33.993
My horse is number 8,
Tessie In the green shirt.

55:40.254 --> 55:42.832
Come on, Tessie! Come on!

55:44.758 --> 55:48.177
Get up there. Come on!

55:48.178 --> 55:50.426
Attagirl, Tessie.
Pass her! Pass her!

55:53.100 --> 55:56.769
Attagirl, Tess!

55:56.770 --> 55:58.145
Oh, she made it!

55:58.146 --> 56:01.395
She won! She won!
Oh, Pat, your horse won!

56:22.212 --> 56:23.963
it can't be much fun for you

56:23.964 --> 56:26.924
just hanging around waiting
to catch me between songs.

56:26.925 --> 56:28.645
Can't think of anything
I'd rather be doing.

56:29.469 --> 56:33.347
Anyway, we can... I mean, can
we go someplace after the show?

56:33.348 --> 56:35.641
I thought maybe we'd have
something to eat or something.

56:35.642 --> 56:37.476
Well, I can't tonight, Wayne.

56:37.477 --> 56:39.937
- It's Marty's birthday.
- Who's Marty?

56:39.938 --> 56:43.482
The boy I sing with in the band. We're
giving a surprise party for him.

56:43.483 --> 56:45.151
Wouldn't you like to come?

56:45.152 --> 56:47.612
I was kind of counting
on being alone with you.

56:48.780 --> 56:50.323
I know. I'd like that better too.

56:50.324 --> 56:52.700
But this is a party
we cooked up a week ago.

56:52.701 --> 56:54.827
We're giving it in my rooms
at the hotel

56:54.828 --> 56:58.456
- so I can't very well back out now.
- Hey, Emily.

56:58.457 --> 57:02.168
- They're playing the introduction.
- All right, Marty.

57:02.169 --> 57:04.337
Now don't go away.
I'll be right back.

57:07.841 --> 57:10.214
Okay, let's go.

57:13.180 --> 57:15.431
Listen, kids, I got
the greatest number here...

57:15.432 --> 57:17.683
McGee, if you ever scare me
like that again...

57:17.684 --> 57:21.771
I got the greatest number I ever plugged,
and I'm gonna give you first crack at it.

57:21.772 --> 57:24.273
Buzz off, McGee. We're busy.

57:24.274 --> 57:28.524
Eh, just like all singers,
they don't like songs.

57:35.285 --> 57:37.703
- Hi, buddy.
- Hello.

57:37.704 --> 57:41.290
- You in the music business?
- No. I'm a farmer.

57:41.291 --> 57:46.337
A farmer. What a night I'm having.

57:46.338 --> 57:48.422
Well, uh, you're a friend
of Emily's, ain't ya?

57:48.423 --> 57:49.548
That's right.

57:49.549 --> 57:53.344
- My name's McGee.
- My name's Wayne Frake.

57:53.345 --> 57:55.805
- You in the music business?
- Yeah, I'm a song plugger.

57:55.806 --> 57:58.891
- I work on songs till they get popular.
- How do you mean work on 'em?

57:58.892 --> 58:01.227
I thought songs got popular
because people like 'em.

58:01.228 --> 58:04.981
That's naive. How can people like
a song if they don't hear it?

58:04.982 --> 58:06.691
You got to get the big
singers to sing it first.

58:06.692 --> 58:07.900
How do you do that?

58:07.901 --> 58:11.487
There's all kinds of ways,
and none of them is easy.

58:11.488 --> 58:15.408
You got no idea what a snook like me has
to do to get a song on the hit parade.

58:15.409 --> 58:17.910
Last week I fell down in
front of Dinah Shore's taxi

58:17.911 --> 58:19.787
just to get in
conversation with her.

58:19.788 --> 58:23.499
Every Christmas, I got to remember
to send Sinatra a new bow tie.

58:23.500 --> 58:25.418
When a bandleader's
wife has a baby,

58:25.419 --> 58:28.587
I gotta stay home with it
on the nurse's night out.

58:28.588 --> 58:31.298
It's a big question whether Mairzy
Doats would have been a hit

58:31.299 --> 58:34.427
if I hadn't had known
how to change a "didey."

58:34.428 --> 58:37.930
- Is that a new song you got there?
- Yeah, and it's a honey.

58:37.931 --> 58:40.516
A natural for your friend Emily.

58:40.517 --> 58:43.269
You wouldn't wanna help me
get it to her, would ya?

58:43.270 --> 58:46.269
I am not at all niggardly
when it comes to payola.

58:46.648 --> 58:49.476
- Payola?
- Ah, it's a technical term. Forget it.

58:50.944 --> 58:55.948
The man who wrote this song is
starving in an attic in Brooklyn.

58:55.949 --> 58:58.617
His wife ran out on him,
left him penniless with two kids.

58:58.618 --> 59:02.663
She even took the piano with her
so now he can't write no more.

59:02.664 --> 59:07.001
If this song ain't a hit, there's
only one thing left for this man,

59:07.002 --> 59:08.294
the river.

59:09.254 --> 59:13.090
On the other hand, if somebody was to
get a great artist like Emily Edwards

59:13.091 --> 59:15.676
to introduce it with
a band on the radio,

59:15.677 --> 59:20.223
this man's fortune would be made and
his genius preserved for posterity.

59:20.390 --> 59:22.683
How do you know he ain't
another Stephen Foster?

59:22.684 --> 59:25.394
- I don't. Only...
- Just read those words.

59:25.395 --> 59:29.648
Here. Take a couple of copies. I'll hum
the tune so you can see how they fit.

59:29.649 --> 59:32.193
Follow me.

59:38.825 --> 59:42.154
Right there.

59:45.082 --> 59:49.376
It's a grand night for singing

59:49.377 --> 59:53.172
The stars are bright above

59:53.173 --> 59:57.218
The earth is aglow
and to add to the show

59:57.219 --> 01:00:01.222
I think I am falling in love

01:00:01.223 --> 01:00:03.307
Falling

01:00:03.308 --> 01:00:07.311
Falling in love

01:00:07.312 --> 01:00:11.148
Maybe it's more than the moon

01:00:11.149 --> 01:00:15.111
Maybe it's more than the birds

01:00:15.112 --> 01:00:18.614
Maybe it's more
than the sight of the night

01:00:18.615 --> 01:00:23.077
In a light too lovely for words

01:00:23.078 --> 01:00:26.455
Maybe it's more than the earth

01:00:26.456 --> 01:00:31.127
Shiny in silvery blue

01:00:31.128 --> 01:00:34.880
Maybe the reason
I'm feeling this way

01:00:34.881 --> 01:00:38.551
Has something to do with you

01:00:38.552 --> 01:00:43.013
It's a grand night for singing

01:00:43.014 --> 01:00:46.809
The stars are bright above

01:00:46.810 --> 01:00:51.021
The earth is aglow
and to add to the show

01:00:51.022 --> 01:00:55.484
I think I am falling in love

01:00:55.485 --> 01:00:57.570
Falling

01:00:57.571 --> 01:01:00.531
Falling in love

01:01:00.532 --> 01:01:02.985
La, la, la, la, la, la

01:01:04.703 --> 01:01:07.913
- Hey, where's my drink?
- Let's see what else we've got here.

01:01:07.914 --> 01:01:10.082
Look, Wayne, how about
your singing a chorus?

01:01:10.083 --> 01:01:13.043
No, thanks. You're doing
all right without me.

01:01:13.044 --> 01:01:16.255
- But I want them to hear you.
- You can't be as good as she says.

01:01:16.256 --> 01:01:19.758
- You'd be surprised. Come on.
- No, really.

01:01:19.759 --> 01:01:22.094
Come on. Don't tell me
we have to coax you.

01:01:22.095 --> 01:01:24.221
How about singing one
of those corn-fed ditties

01:01:24.222 --> 01:01:26.599
you guys sing around
these little towns?

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:29.226
- Come on, Wayne. Sing anything you like.
- Yeah, you can't tell.

01:01:29.227 --> 01:01:31.604
You might have something
we can use with the band.

01:01:31.605 --> 01:01:35.107
As a matter of fact, if you need a new song,
I've got one right here I like very much.

01:01:35.108 --> 01:01:37.818
He didn't expect to sing, but
he brought his music with him.

01:01:40.071 --> 01:01:42.948
- Would you like to try it with me?
- You do it yourself.

01:01:42.949 --> 01:01:46.949
- Did you write it?
- No, I didn't. A fellow gave it to me.

01:01:47.078 --> 01:01:49.747
- Okay, bud.
- Okay, bud.

01:01:50.832 --> 01:01:52.124
This ought to be something.

01:01:53.251 --> 01:01:57.296
Maybe you'll never be
the love of my life

01:01:57.297 --> 01:02:01.008
Maybe I'm not the boy
of your dreams

01:02:01.009 --> 01:02:05.221
But isn't it kind of fun
to look in each other's eyes

01:02:05.222 --> 01:02:08.974
Swapping romantic gleams

01:02:08.975 --> 01:02:12.728
Maybe you're not a girl
to have and to hold

01:02:12.729 --> 01:02:16.398
Maybe I'm not a boy who would stay

01:02:16.399 --> 01:02:20.444
But isn't it kind of fun
carousing around the town

01:02:20.445 --> 01:02:24.281
Dancing the night away

01:02:24.282 --> 01:02:28.077
Isn't it kind of fun holding hands

01:02:28.078 --> 01:02:31.997
According to a sweet
and corny custom

01:02:31.998 --> 01:02:35.876
Isn't it kind of fun making vows

01:02:35.877 --> 01:02:39.922
Admitting that we both
intend to bust 'em

01:02:39.923 --> 01:02:43.926
Maybe we're out for laughs
A girl and a boy

01:02:43.927 --> 01:02:47.304
Kidding across a table for two

01:02:47.305 --> 01:02:51.517
But haven't you got a hunch
that this is the real McCoy

01:02:51.518 --> 01:02:55.229
And all the things
we tell each other

01:02:55.230 --> 01:02:57.478
Are true

01:02:59.609 --> 01:03:03.487
I'm not a girl
for sentimental tripe

01:03:03.488 --> 01:03:07.366
I never go for the Romeo type

01:03:07.367 --> 01:03:11.120
Over a dewy-eyed Juliet

01:03:11.121 --> 01:03:15.040
No one has seen me drool yet

01:03:15.041 --> 01:03:18.544
I don't say our hearts are tied

01:03:18.545 --> 01:03:22.548
By love's eternal tether

01:03:22.549 --> 01:03:27.678
But using words less dignified

01:03:27.679 --> 01:03:31.557
Isn't it kind of fun to be together

01:03:31.558 --> 01:03:35.227
Maybe you'll never be
the love of my life

01:03:35.228 --> 01:03:39.064
Maybe I'm not the girl
of your dreams

01:03:39.065 --> 01:03:43.027
But isn't it kind of fun
to look in each other's eyes

01:03:43.028 --> 01:03:46.822
Swapping romantic gleams

01:03:46.823 --> 01:03:50.743
Maybe I'm not a girl
to have and to hold

01:03:50.744 --> 01:03:54.580
Well, maybe I'm not
a boy who would stay

01:03:54.581 --> 01:03:58.417
But isn't it kind of fun
carousing around the town

01:03:58.418 --> 01:04:02.254
Dancing the night away

01:04:02.255 --> 01:04:06.300
Oh, isn't it kind
of fun holding hands

01:04:06.301 --> 01:04:10.179
According to a sweet
and corny custom

01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:14.141
Isn't it kind of fun making vows

01:04:14.142 --> 01:04:18.020
Admitting that we both
intend to bust 'em

01:04:18.021 --> 01:04:22.107
Maybe we're out for laughs
A girl and a boy

01:04:22.108 --> 01:04:25.819
Kidding across a table for two

01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:29.698
- But haven't you got a hunch
- That this is the real McCoy

01:04:29.699 --> 01:04:33.285
And all the things
we tell each other

01:04:33.286 --> 01:04:37.957
Are true

01:04:38.458 --> 01:04:41.627
- Wonderful.
- That was great.

01:04:41.628 --> 01:04:44.838
You know, you're right about
that song, Wayne. I like it too.

01:04:44.839 --> 01:04:47.216
- You do?
- "Billings Publishing Company," huh?

01:04:47.217 --> 01:04:49.385
- A guy named McGee give you this?
- That's right.

01:04:49.386 --> 01:04:51.095
How much did he slip you
for plugging it tonight?

01:04:51.096 --> 01:04:52.304
Wait a minute, Marty!

01:04:52.305 --> 01:04:53.430
He didn't slip me anything.

01:04:53.431 --> 01:04:55.140
Didn't he promise to come
through with the old payola?

01:04:55.141 --> 01:04:58.477
- He used that expression.
- I'll bet he did. That's great, Emily.

01:04:58.478 --> 01:05:00.396
Your boyfriend cashing in on you.

01:05:04.442 --> 01:05:07.611
- How do you like that?
- Wayne!

01:05:07.612 --> 01:05:09.906
Wayne.

01:05:11.116 --> 01:05:13.909
Wayne, wait a minute.

01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:16.328
I'm sorry, Emily.
I just couldn't help it.

01:05:16.329 --> 01:05:18.330
He's been putting in digs
ever since I got here.

01:05:18.331 --> 01:05:21.705
I know he was asking for it,
but please don't go.

01:05:22.335 --> 01:05:25.629
You don't think I'd cash in on being
friends with you like he said, do you?

01:05:25.630 --> 01:05:30.008
Of course not. And he wouldn't have
said it, only he's had a few drinks.

01:05:30.009 --> 01:05:33.053
- Please come back.
- It just wouldn't work, Emily.

01:05:33.054 --> 01:05:36.053
I'd let him have it the first
time he opened his mouth.

01:05:36.349 --> 01:05:38.183
Look. Why don't you
walk around the block?

01:05:38.184 --> 01:05:41.388
Give me a chance to get rid
of them. How about that?

01:05:41.855 --> 01:05:44.524
I'd hate to have you
break up the party.

01:05:45.608 --> 01:05:47.359
I'll tell them I have a headache.

01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:49.358
When you come back, we'll be alone.

01:05:50.196 --> 01:05:51.989
That's the way
you wanted it, isn't it?

01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:57.621
- Okay. How long?
- Come back in half an hour.

01:06:03.668 --> 01:06:05.040
Emily, I...

01:06:22.645 --> 01:06:25.268
- Half an hour.
- Make it 15 minutes.

01:06:26.816 --> 01:06:28.233
All right.

01:06:53.259 --> 01:06:56.136
Only a few stars left.

01:06:56.137 --> 01:06:59.765
Yeah, and they look kind of tired.

01:06:59.766 --> 01:07:02.059
Funny how a day creeps on.

01:07:02.060 --> 01:07:05.437
So slowly at first
you think it's never coming.

01:07:05.438 --> 01:07:09.191
Then all of a sudden,
it spreads out over the sky,

01:07:09.192 --> 01:07:11.315
the sun starts shining.

01:07:12.445 --> 01:07:14.818
People loom up like that too.

01:07:17.283 --> 01:07:21.119
Are you really gonna go home and
marry that guy you're engaged to?

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:25.832
That's what girls usually do, isn't it?
Marry the men they're engaged to.

01:07:25.833 --> 01:07:28.661
Yeah. They're usually
sorry afterward.

01:07:30.505 --> 01:07:32.965
Think you'll every marry?

01:07:32.966 --> 01:07:36.760
Who, me? Sure. Sometime.

01:07:36.761 --> 01:07:39.763
Only trouble is, if I ever found
a girl I cared that much about,

01:07:39.764 --> 01:07:42.975
I'd care too much about it to
wish a guy like me off on her.

01:07:42.976 --> 01:07:47.646
- Sounds kind of hopeless.
- I guess it is.

01:07:47.647 --> 01:07:50.148
It's pretty hard for me
to picture myself,

01:07:50.149 --> 01:07:52.484
what do they call it,
popping the question.

01:07:52.485 --> 01:07:55.654
Can you imagine me suddenly turning
to some girl and blurting out,

01:07:55.655 --> 01:07:57.198
"Will you marry me?"

01:08:03.246 --> 01:08:05.790
No. I can see you wouldn't.

01:08:07.875 --> 01:08:10.711
Well, bobbylocks, you've
made a very wise decision.

01:08:10.712 --> 01:08:14.792
Anyway, I'd be no good
for you, no good at all.

01:08:16.341 --> 01:08:18.920
Of course, you'd be
awfully good for me.

01:08:21.639 --> 01:08:23.724
Say, what about your old man's hog?

01:08:23.725 --> 01:08:25.604
Aren't they gonna judge
him this afternoon?

01:08:26.894 --> 01:08:31.224
Oh, yes. I guess
I'd better be going.

01:08:33.067 --> 01:08:36.194
- Wayne's probably in already.
- it's getting pretty late.

01:08:36.194 --> 01:08:40.616
- Don't you want me to go with you?
- No. It's better if you don't.

01:08:40.617 --> 01:08:43.118
- Will I see you tonight?
- In front of the roller coaster?

01:08:43.118 --> 01:08:44.411
8:30.

01:08:45.203 --> 01:08:47.497
Well, I...

01:08:54.921 --> 01:08:58.376
- Good night, honey.
- Good night.

01:09:03.514 --> 01:09:05.182
- Pat?
- Yes?

01:09:05.183 --> 01:09:10.514
I was only talking. I couldn't
marry anybody but you, ever.

01:09:27.872 --> 01:09:31.582
Well, Blue Boy,
this is the great day,

01:09:31.584 --> 01:09:33.161
your hour of judgment.

01:09:35.921 --> 01:09:38.966
Now take it easy there now.
Don't get your face dirty.

01:09:40.426 --> 01:09:44.513
Look, Mother, Blue Boy's already
won. There's his blue ribbon.

01:09:44.514 --> 01:09:47.307
Oh, that thing?
That's only the class award.

01:09:47.308 --> 01:09:50.268
That means he's won
his class of senior boars.

01:09:50.269 --> 01:09:53.604
I'm getting him ready now to go
in for the grand championship.

01:09:53.606 --> 01:09:56.733
- Is he all right?
- All right? Why, just look at him.

01:09:56.734 --> 01:09:58.777
He's fit as a fiddle.

01:09:58.778 --> 01:10:02.614
Class 51, Hampshire senior sows,

01:10:02.615 --> 01:10:06.284
- pavilion number two.
- Better go in now, son.

01:10:06.285 --> 01:10:08.578
Get seated.
We go in right after this.

01:10:08.579 --> 01:10:09.996
- We'd better get going.
- Good luck, Pa.

01:10:09.997 --> 01:10:12.124
- Thanks, Ma.
- You too, Blue Boy.

01:10:12.125 --> 01:10:15.955
- We'll be pulling for you.
- All right. Bye. See you later.

01:10:16.421 --> 01:10:18.089
Well, let's see.

01:10:18.464 --> 01:10:21.591
Is your face clean, son?
Yes, you're all right.

01:10:21.592 --> 01:10:24.295
You gotta look your best, you know.

01:10:30.643 --> 01:10:31.935
You taking her in, Hank?

01:10:31.936 --> 01:10:35.561
No, not yet. Just taking her
out to put her on the scale.

01:10:44.782 --> 01:10:47.868
Blue Boy, what's the matter, son?

01:10:47.869 --> 01:10:50.454
Oh, you think
Esmeralda's gone home.

01:10:50.455 --> 01:10:53.331
No, she's just gone
out to be weighed.

01:10:53.332 --> 01:10:56.585
Hampshire boars, get ready, please.

01:10:56.586 --> 01:10:58.336
That's us, son. Come on. Get up.

01:10:58.337 --> 01:11:01.590
Oh, don't act this way.
Esmeralda will be back.

01:11:01.591 --> 01:11:04.468
She ain't gonna be judged
until after you win.

01:11:04.469 --> 01:11:08.014
Come on, boy. Get up.

01:11:08.264 --> 01:11:10.557
You hear that? That's the band.
They're playing for you, son.

01:11:10.558 --> 01:11:12.886
You can't lay down on me now.

01:11:13.352 --> 01:11:16.313
Oh, come on, fella, please.

01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:32.955
Attention, please. Attention.

01:11:33.206 --> 01:11:36.541
And now, ladies and
gentlemen, I have the honor

01:11:36.542 --> 01:11:40.504
of introducing to you
a man whom you all know,

01:11:40.505 --> 01:11:43.465
Congressman James A. Goodheart.

01:11:49.722 --> 01:11:54.059
During this great day
of boar judging,

01:11:54.060 --> 01:11:55.685
you have seen hundreds

01:11:55.686 --> 01:11:59.856
of seemingly perfect boars
eliminated,

01:11:59.857 --> 01:12:02.317
leaving only two contestants,

01:12:02.318 --> 01:12:05.237
the junior champion
and the senior champion,

01:12:05.238 --> 01:12:07.739
both perfect specimens

01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:11.820
representing excellence
of breeding.

01:12:12.119 --> 01:12:16.164
The judges realize the
importance of their decision,

01:12:16.165 --> 01:12:18.834
for the boar
they decide is the better

01:12:18.835 --> 01:12:23.171
will be acclaimed
grand champion boar

01:12:23.172 --> 01:12:26.591
of this year's state fair.

01:12:37.937 --> 01:12:40.939
Introducing the first contestant,

01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:42.190
Whirlwind...

01:12:43.276 --> 01:12:46.025
number 188.

01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:49.865
Winner, junior champion boar.

01:12:50.324 --> 01:12:54.654
Owner, Mr. R.C. Martin.

01:12:56.622 --> 01:12:58.415
He's awful big, isn't he?

01:12:58.416 --> 01:13:00.493
Blue Boy will outpoint him.

01:13:07.341 --> 01:13:10.176
And now, for the second contestant,

01:13:10.177 --> 01:13:12.470
introducing Blue Boy.

01:13:12.471 --> 01:13:16.426
- Where's Dad?
- Yes, now what?

01:13:17.351 --> 01:13:18.476
Where is he?

01:13:18.477 --> 01:13:21.100
Introducing Blue Boy,

01:13:23.316 --> 01:13:26.645
number 1494.

01:13:27.778 --> 01:13:31.406
Winning senior champion boar.

01:13:31.407 --> 01:13:34.781
Owner, Mr. Abel Frake.

01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:57.888
Whoa, Blue Boy.

01:14:09.028 --> 01:14:11.447
Whoa, Blue Boy. Whoa, Blue Boy.

01:14:14.075 --> 01:14:15.902
Whoa, Blue Boy.

01:14:29.215 --> 01:14:31.841
They didn't look at him
very long, did they?

01:14:31.842 --> 01:14:33.385
They'll be back.

01:14:51.946 --> 01:14:56.282
Blue Boy, get up. Get up on your
feet. The judges will see you.

01:14:56.283 --> 01:14:59.578
Oh, this is terrible.
He'll lose sure.

01:15:03.249 --> 01:15:05.952
Get up, Blue Boy. Blue Boy!

01:15:07.503 --> 01:15:10.877
Come on, son. Get up. Son?

01:15:12.675 --> 01:15:14.759
What's the matter with him?
Get him up.

01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:18.555
- We can't judge him lying down.
- Come on, Blue Boy! Get up, will ya?

01:15:18.556 --> 01:15:23.059
Blue Boy, come on!
Blue Boy, come on.

01:15:26.105 --> 01:15:29.107
Come on, son. Get up.

01:15:29.108 --> 01:15:31.651
Come on, Blue Boy.
Get up, will you?

01:15:31.652 --> 01:15:34.321
Come on, Blue Boy. Come on.

01:15:36.115 --> 01:15:39.660
Just a little tired, that's all.

01:16:09.023 --> 01:16:12.609
Attention, please. Attention.

01:16:12.610 --> 01:16:17.031
I have the honor to announce the winner
of this year's grand championship.

01:16:17.656 --> 01:16:21.235
Hampshire boar, Blue Boy.

01:16:40.596 --> 01:16:43.389
it gives me great pleasure.
Congratulations.

01:16:43.390 --> 01:16:47.352
- Thank you.
- I'm so happy!

01:16:47.353 --> 01:16:50.978
- Oh, Pa!
- Congratulations, Mr. Frake.

01:16:53.984 --> 01:16:56.152
My, my. Whoever wrote this

01:16:56.153 --> 01:16:59.280
must be a friend
of the Frake family.

01:16:59.281 --> 01:17:01.783
"As Mr. Abel Frake
won the grand award,

01:17:01.784 --> 01:17:04.619
"he was watched from the
grandstand by his charming wife,

01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:08.206
"and talented and beautiful
daughter Marguerite."

01:17:08.207 --> 01:17:11.042
- Come on, Wayne. It's getting late.
- Just a minute.

01:17:11.043 --> 01:17:14.003
Say, you look mighty pretty tonight.
Is that a new dress?

01:17:14.004 --> 01:17:17.715
- Uh-huh. Do you like it?
- Prettiest girl I ever saw.

01:17:17.716 --> 01:17:19.008
Okay, I'm ready.

01:17:19.009 --> 01:17:21.177
Not too late now. We wanna get
an early start in the morning.

01:17:21.178 --> 01:17:24.222
Might be a little late. It's the
last night. So long, Dad.

01:17:24.223 --> 01:17:25.766
- Bye.
- So long.

01:17:27.768 --> 01:17:29.644
They look nice together,
don't they?

01:17:29.645 --> 01:17:31.597
Hmm? What'd you say?

01:17:32.523 --> 01:17:35.067
I said we had two lovely children.

01:17:35.609 --> 01:17:37.026
Who said we didn't?

01:17:39.780 --> 01:17:41.906
I wish Margy would make
up her mind about Harry.

01:17:41.907 --> 01:17:46.494
Why? He won't run away.
He's one of those goody-goody boys.

01:17:46.495 --> 01:17:49.122
I don't see anything
wrong with that.

01:17:49.123 --> 01:17:51.499
You were a good boy
when I fell in love with you.

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:55.503
That's what you thought.

01:17:55.504 --> 01:17:59.757
Well, since you're such a gay dog,

01:17:59.758 --> 01:18:02.760
you'd better take me to the
midway tonight for a little fun.

01:18:02.761 --> 01:18:06.264
- No, Ma, you're all tired out.
- Who said I was tired?

01:18:06.265 --> 01:18:09.767
Say. Here's something interesting.

01:18:09.768 --> 01:18:12.520
It's about that judge, the fella
that gave you the plaque.

01:18:12.521 --> 01:18:17.943
It says here how he had a kind of seizure
afterwards, delirium tremens sort of.

01:18:18.903 --> 01:18:21.613
"While Mr. Hippenstahl
was unconscious,

01:18:21.614 --> 01:18:24.613
"he kept murmuring
something about mincemeat.

01:18:25.743 --> 01:18:29.618
"Those nearby declared they could
smell brandy on his breath."

01:18:40.633 --> 01:18:41.834
You fool.

01:18:43.469 --> 01:18:45.220
Now, just for that,
you've got to take me out.

01:18:45.221 --> 01:18:46.346
Oh, no, Ma.

01:18:46.347 --> 01:18:48.640
I've got that nice
tired-out feeling.

01:18:48.641 --> 01:18:51.476
- You and I are going to the fair.
- I've seen the fair.

01:18:51.477 --> 01:18:54.229
You've seen the hog pavilion.

01:18:54.230 --> 01:18:57.232
Are you going
to get out of that chair?

01:18:57.233 --> 01:18:59.817
Now, Ma, I'm up.

01:18:59.818 --> 01:19:02.820
Now go on in and change
your clothes. Go on.

01:19:02.821 --> 01:19:04.318
I want some excitement.

01:19:20.005 --> 01:19:24.467
I can hear 'em calling hogs
in the clear Ioway air

01:19:24.468 --> 01:19:28.721
I can sniff the fragrant
whiff of an Ioway rose

01:19:28.722 --> 01:19:31.015
You've got Ioway in your heart

01:19:31.016 --> 01:19:33.518
I've got Ioway in my hair

01:19:33.519 --> 01:19:37.021
I've got Ioway in my ears
and eyes and nose

01:19:38.148 --> 01:19:40.400
Oh, I know all I owe

01:19:40.401 --> 01:19:42.944
I owe Ioway

01:19:42.945 --> 01:19:47.407
I owe Ioway all I owe
and I know why

01:19:47.408 --> 01:19:49.701
I am Ioway born and bred

01:19:49.702 --> 01:19:52.078
And on Ioway corn I'm fed

01:19:52.079 --> 01:19:56.582
Not to mention
her barley, wheat and rye

01:19:56.583 --> 01:19:59.043
I owe Ioway for her ham

01:19:59.044 --> 01:20:01.379
And her beef and her lamb

01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:03.756
And her strawberry jam

01:20:03.757 --> 01:20:05.925
And her pie

01:20:05.926 --> 01:20:10.513
I owe Ioway more
than I can ever pay

01:20:10.514 --> 01:20:15.310
So I think
I'll move to Calif om-i-ay

01:20:15.311 --> 01:20:17.812
- What a shame
- What a shame

01:20:17.813 --> 01:20:20.106
- What a shame
- What a shame

01:20:20.107 --> 01:20:23.443
You'll be good and gosh
darn sorry when you go

01:20:23.444 --> 01:20:27.071
- Don't I know
- When you leave your native state

01:20:27.072 --> 01:20:29.532
You'll be feeling far from great

01:20:29.533 --> 01:20:34.330
You'll be good and gosh
darn sorry when you go

01:20:36.457 --> 01:20:38.541
I'm a seed

01:20:38.542 --> 01:20:41.044
Of Ioway grain

01:20:41.045 --> 01:20:43.212
You're a breeze

01:20:43.213 --> 01:20:45.882
That Ioway blew

01:20:45.883 --> 01:20:48.134
I'm a drop

01:20:48.135 --> 01:20:50.636
Of Ioway rain

01:20:50.637 --> 01:20:54.341
You're a drip of Ioway dew

01:20:55.434 --> 01:20:57.769
Oh, I know all I owe

01:20:57.770 --> 01:21:00.355
I owe Ioway

01:21:00.356 --> 01:21:05.109
- I owe Ioway all I owe and I know why
- Ioway

01:21:05.110 --> 01:21:07.445
I am Ioway born and bred

01:21:07.446 --> 01:21:09.572
And on Ioway corn I'm fed

01:21:09.573 --> 01:21:14.285
Not to mention
her barley, wheat and rye

01:21:14.286 --> 01:21:16.746
I owe Ioway for her ham

01:21:16.747 --> 01:21:18.956
And her beef and her lamb

01:21:18.957 --> 01:21:21.417
And her strawberry jam

01:21:21.418 --> 01:21:22.794
And her pie

01:21:22.795 --> 01:21:23.920
That's right.

01:21:23.921 --> 01:21:28.257
I owe Ioway more
than anyone should owe

01:21:28.258 --> 01:21:31.719
So I think I'll start
in owing Idaho

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:33.054
All together.

01:21:33.055 --> 01:21:35.556
- What a shame
- What a shame

01:21:35.557 --> 01:21:37.892
- What a shame
- What a shame

01:21:37.893 --> 01:21:42.647
- You'll be crying like a baby when you go
- Don't I know

01:21:42.648 --> 01:21:44.816
When I leave my native heath

01:21:44.817 --> 01:21:47.276
With my lip between my teeth

01:21:47.277 --> 01:21:52.199
I'll be bawling like a booby
when I go

01:21:54.159 --> 01:21:56.452
You're a seed

01:21:56.453 --> 01:21:58.913
Of Ioway grain

01:21:58.914 --> 01:22:01.165
You're a breeze

01:22:01.166 --> 01:22:03.835
That Ioway blew

01:22:03.836 --> 01:22:05.920
I'm a drop

01:22:05.921 --> 01:22:08.506
Of Ioway rain

01:22:08.507 --> 01:22:10.591
You're a drip

01:22:10.592 --> 01:22:13.136
Of Ioway dew

01:22:19.017 --> 01:22:21.185
Oh, I know all I owe

01:22:21.186 --> 01:22:23.271
- I owe Ioway
- I owe Ioway

01:22:23.272 --> 01:22:27.358
- I owe Ioway all I owe and I know why
- I owe Ioway

01:22:27.359 --> 01:22:31.362
I am Ioway born and bred
and on Ioway corn I'm fed

01:22:31.363 --> 01:22:35.533
- Not to mention her barley, wheat and rye
- Barley, wheat and rye

01:22:35.534 --> 01:22:37.702
I owe Ioway for her ham

01:22:37.703 --> 01:22:39.871
And her beef and her lamb

01:22:39.872 --> 01:22:43.708
- And her strawberry jam and her pie
- Pie, pie, pie, pie

01:22:43.709 --> 01:22:47.879
- I owe Ioway more than anyone should owe
- Oh

01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:52.049
So I think I'll start
in owing Idaho

01:22:52.050 --> 01:22:54.218
Better stay

01:22:54.219 --> 01:22:56.429
Better stay

01:22:56.430 --> 01:22:58.723
You'll be good and gosh
darn sorry if you go

01:22:58.724 --> 01:23:00.224
Don't I know

01:23:00.225 --> 01:23:02.477
When you leave your native state

01:23:02.478 --> 01:23:04.645
You'll be feeling far from great

01:23:04.646 --> 01:23:11.695
You'll be good and gosh
darn sorry when you go

01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:18.493
I owe Ioway for her ham
and her beef and her lamb

01:23:18.494 --> 01:23:21.954
And her strawberry jam and her pie

01:23:21.955 --> 01:23:25.833
I owe Ioway more
than I can ever pay

01:23:25.834 --> 01:23:28.419
So I think I'll move
to Californ-i-ay

01:23:28.420 --> 01:23:32.798
I-O-W! I-O-W! I-O-W! I-O-W-A!

01:23:32.799 --> 01:23:36.879
Hooray! Ioway! Yea!

01:23:44.978 --> 01:23:47.438
What do you think of this
imitation champagne, Ma?

01:23:47.439 --> 01:23:50.149
First time I ever tried it,
and I love it.

01:23:50.150 --> 01:23:52.443
It's as good as that
French champagne any day.

01:23:52.444 --> 01:23:55.818
- Did you ever taste French champagne?
- No.

01:23:58.825 --> 01:23:59.951
Who's that little runt?

01:23:59.952 --> 01:24:02.450
- Hmm?
- What's he grinning at?

01:24:09.753 --> 01:24:13.172
That's Mr. Hippenstahl,
the pickle and mincemeat judge.

01:24:13.173 --> 01:24:15.550
Oh. Oh!

01:24:15.551 --> 01:24:18.302
Well, that explains it. He's drunk!

01:24:18.303 --> 01:24:21.430
- Quiet, Pa.
- Come on, Ma.

01:24:21.431 --> 01:24:24.555
- Let's get out on the midway.
- All right.

01:24:28.313 --> 01:24:32.984
Hey, buddy! I wanna thank you for the
plug you gave that song last night.

01:24:32.985 --> 01:24:36.654
It's all set with Tommy Thomas for Emily
to sing it in Chicago tomorrow night.

01:24:36.655 --> 01:24:38.531
- Chicago?
- Yeah. That's their next date,

01:24:38.532 --> 01:24:40.074
the Palmer House.

01:24:40.075 --> 01:24:42.159
I'm going with them
on the plane tonight.

01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:44.829
Sticking close so they
won't change their mind.

01:24:44.830 --> 01:24:48.249
Emily didn't say she was... I didn't
figure on them leaving tonight.

01:24:48.250 --> 01:24:51.419
Sure, right after the show.

01:24:51.420 --> 01:24:54.922
I wish she'd hurry up and get
out here. I wanna talk to her.

01:24:54.923 --> 01:24:58.009
Kind of went overboard for
each other, didn't you, kid?

01:24:58.010 --> 01:25:00.678
- Kind of.
- She told me.

01:25:00.679 --> 01:25:03.681
Oh, they all tell me everything.

01:25:03.682 --> 01:25:07.184
- You going back to the farm soon?
- Tomorrow.

01:25:07.185 --> 01:25:10.514
That'll be good.

01:25:12.149 --> 01:25:13.941
Come in.

01:25:13.942 --> 01:25:15.901
- Oh, hello.
- I was just on my way out.

01:25:15.902 --> 01:25:19.363
- I'll say you are. Where's your suitcase?
- Suitcase? What for?

01:25:19.364 --> 01:25:23.242
The old man just phoned from Chicago.
He's gonna give you a crack at that job.

01:25:23.243 --> 01:25:26.537
- The Eastern syndicate?
- That's right. A column of your own.

01:25:26.538 --> 01:25:29.206
- I can't believe it.
- He's leaving for the coast in the morning

01:25:29.207 --> 01:25:31.959
and he wants you to fly up to
Chicago and talk to him tonight.

01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:34.420
- That means the 8:30 plane.
- How much time have I got?

01:25:34.421 --> 01:25:37.921
Practically none. I'm holding a taxi
downstairs. I'll get your shaving things.

01:25:41.470 --> 01:25:43.763
- Hey, wait!
- What's the matter?

01:25:43.764 --> 01:25:46.891
I can't leave now. I've got a girl
waiting for me out at the fair.

01:25:46.892 --> 01:25:49.560
- What'll I do?
- Do? Get another girl in Chicago.

01:25:49.561 --> 01:25:51.771
A girl waiting at the fair.

01:25:51.772 --> 01:25:55.441
I break my neck getting this chance for you
and you start yapping about some girl.

01:25:55.442 --> 01:25:58.611
- This is different. This is not just a girl.
- I know. She's wonderful.

01:25:58.612 --> 01:26:01.906
Only girl in the world. And I
suppose this job is just a job.

01:26:01.907 --> 01:26:03.991
The kind that comes up every day.

01:26:03.992 --> 01:26:06.952
Look, I wanna make something
very clear to you, sonny-boy.

01:26:06.953 --> 01:26:08.454
The old man is funny.

01:26:08.455 --> 01:26:11.248
When he wants you someplace,
you better, or you're through.

01:26:11.249 --> 01:26:13.959
- I know that, but...
- Do you want this job or don't you?

01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:17.414
You've got about two minutes
to make up your mind.

01:26:17.589 --> 01:26:20.087
Thank you very much.

01:26:22.135 --> 01:26:25.763
- What did she say?
- She sees a lot of money coming my way.

01:26:25.764 --> 01:26:30.142
- Good. I can use some.
- I don't think it'll do you much good.

01:26:30.143 --> 01:26:33.979
She says I'm going
to marry three times.

01:26:33.980 --> 01:26:36.065
There they are, folks,

01:26:36.066 --> 01:26:38.401
the eight fugitives
from the Follies.

01:26:38.402 --> 01:26:41.946
They did a little dance in New York,
but the police commissioner objected.

01:26:41.947 --> 01:26:45.324
He demanded that they take
certain things out of the dance.

01:26:45.325 --> 01:26:49.120
Understand? Well, rather than
do the emasculated version,

01:26:49.121 --> 01:26:54.125
they come out here to give you the
original dance with nothing cut out.

01:26:54.126 --> 01:26:57.920
Just to prove to you what you're
gonna see on the inside...

01:26:57.921 --> 01:27:00.297
Okay, Mike, let her rip!

01:27:22.279 --> 01:27:24.488
- Do you want to go in?
- Huh?

01:27:24.489 --> 01:27:27.408
It means nothing to me,
but if you'd like to see it,

01:27:27.409 --> 01:27:30.783
I'd be glad to take you in, hmm?

01:27:32.539 --> 01:27:33.865
Hmm?

01:27:48.180 --> 01:27:50.556
What do you think?
Of course, like I say,

01:27:50.557 --> 01:27:53.976
it means nothing to me
unless you wanna go in.

01:27:53.977 --> 01:27:57.271
You do? Come on.

01:27:57.272 --> 01:27:58.564
Two, please.

01:28:01.193 --> 01:28:03.486
- Enjoying yourself?
- Yes, we are.

01:28:03.487 --> 01:28:04.734
That's good.

01:28:07.032 --> 01:28:09.617
What's that old buzzard
doing, following you around?

01:28:09.618 --> 01:28:14.699
Don't be foolish, Abel. He's seeing
the fair, having fun, same as we are.

01:28:14.831 --> 01:28:17.500
All aboard. Train now leaving.

01:28:17.501 --> 01:28:21.670
Get tickets for this ride.
Another train coming in.

01:28:21.671 --> 01:28:26.175
Get your tickets for that high,
fast ride through the sky,

01:28:26.176 --> 01:28:29.136
on the big roller coaster

01:28:29.137 --> 01:28:32.762
the big feature ride of the fair.

01:28:33.558 --> 01:28:37.895
But last night and all the things
we said, was that just kidding?

01:28:37.896 --> 01:28:41.106
No, Wayne, it wasn't just kidding.

01:28:41.107 --> 01:28:44.777
Well, it certainly wasn't with me.
I thought that...

01:28:45.862 --> 01:28:48.614
Oh, what's the difference
what I thought?

01:28:48.615 --> 01:28:52.409
But, Wayne, darling, I thought
you understood that...

01:28:52.410 --> 01:28:55.496
Well, after all, we were just
two people who met at a fair...

01:28:55.497 --> 01:28:57.039
And fell in love, didn't we?

01:28:57.040 --> 01:28:59.288
Well, that was something
I hadn't bargained for.

01:29:00.502 --> 01:29:03.581
Wayne, will you believe something?
Just one thing.

01:29:04.464 --> 01:29:07.758
It's every bit as hard for me
to give you up as it is for...

01:29:07.759 --> 01:29:11.595
Well, then why do it?
Why give each other up?

01:29:11.596 --> 01:29:12.930
Why don't you come with me,

01:29:12.931 --> 01:29:14.890
meet my father and mother
and go home with us tomorrow?

01:29:14.891 --> 01:29:19.103
- Because I can't, Wayne. I...
- Hey, Emily.

01:29:19.104 --> 01:29:21.932
- You ready?
- No, she isn't!

01:29:22.899 --> 01:29:24.646
I'll be right in, Marty.

01:29:26.653 --> 01:29:29.777
Wait here, Wayne.
I have to tell you something,

01:29:30.448 --> 01:29:33.450
something I should have
told you before,

01:29:33.451 --> 01:29:37.747
and I would have, if I
hadn't been such a coward.

01:29:39.457 --> 01:29:41.876
Please, wait, Wayne. Please.

01:29:58.768 --> 01:30:00.766
You mind if I say something?

01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:05.854
- Such as what?
- First, let me get something straight.

01:30:06.693 --> 01:30:09.528
When you said that about
taking Emily home with you,

01:30:09.529 --> 01:30:12.698
did you mean the works,
a wedding ring and all?

01:30:12.699 --> 01:30:16.153
That's it, the works. And
that's the way it's gonna be.

01:30:17.329 --> 01:30:20.248
Look, I'll give it to you quick.

01:30:21.166 --> 01:30:24.495
She's married.
She's got a husband, see?

01:30:25.378 --> 01:30:28.005
He don't work at it very hard.

01:30:28.006 --> 01:30:30.674
They split up about a year ago.

01:30:30.675 --> 01:30:33.844
He claims he's a songwriter,
but he's just no good at it.

01:30:33.845 --> 01:30:37.390
As a matter of fact,
he's just no good, period.

01:30:42.729 --> 01:30:46.775
She liked him, though. Sort of
knocked her out for a while.

01:30:47.776 --> 01:30:51.105
Come to think of it, you're the first
guy she's looked at since then.

01:30:52.572 --> 01:30:55.699
I guess I just don't understand
the people in your business.

01:30:55.700 --> 01:30:58.369
Take my word, they're the
same as anybody else.

01:30:58.370 --> 01:31:01.789
They make mistakes, sure,
but don't everybody?

01:31:01.790 --> 01:31:04.584
Are all the people
in your town perfect?

01:31:05.251 --> 01:31:07.169
Why didn't she tell me?

01:31:07.170 --> 01:31:09.838
She told you why.

01:31:09.839 --> 01:31:12.292
She didn't want
to spoil everything.

01:31:13.218 --> 01:31:16.388
Maybe she figured she had a right
to a little happiness too.

01:31:20.433 --> 01:31:23.102
You know what you and me
need right now?

01:31:23.103 --> 01:31:24.429
A drink.

01:31:26.731 --> 01:31:28.274
How about it, buddy?

01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:30.317
Ring the old pipe!

01:31:30.318 --> 01:31:35.447
There she goes. 47! He's
getting higher and higher!

01:31:35.448 --> 01:31:39.535
48! Who's next?

01:31:39.536 --> 01:31:42.955
Not bad. Not bad at all, Mr. Frake.

01:31:42.956 --> 01:31:45.124
Not bad, huh? Thank you.

01:31:45.125 --> 01:31:47.960
But you didn't ring the bell,
though. Ho, ho, ho.

01:31:47.961 --> 01:31:50.546
I know I didn't ring the
bell, though. Ho, ho, ho.

01:31:50.547 --> 01:31:53.590
- Who can? Can you?
- I don't know. I never tried.

01:31:53.591 --> 01:31:56.427
- Why don't you?
- I don't know, but I will.

01:31:56.428 --> 01:31:59.930
Step right up, neighbor.
Step right up.

01:31:59.931 --> 01:32:02.766
- It's kind of heavy, isn't it?
- Allow me.

01:32:02.767 --> 01:32:06.103
Thank you.

01:32:06.104 --> 01:32:08.939
Now, I suppose the idea is
to lean your weight on it.

01:32:08.940 --> 01:32:14.611
Yes. Put all your 120 pounds in it.

01:32:19.534 --> 01:32:21.828
Come on, Ma. I'm tired.
Let's go home.

01:32:23.788 --> 01:32:26.749
I suppose it's too late to stop
someplace for a cup of coffee.

01:32:26.750 --> 01:32:28.998
Who said it was too late?

01:32:40.096 --> 01:32:43.640
- Easy does it, pal. Easy does it.
- I'm okay.

01:32:43.641 --> 01:32:45.893
Sure, you are.

01:32:45.894 --> 01:32:49.938
What about this Eleanor,
the girl from back home?

01:32:49.939 --> 01:32:52.483
You say you graduated
from school together, huh?

01:32:52.484 --> 01:32:56.111
Yep. She's a fine girl too.

01:32:56.112 --> 01:32:58.322
What does she look like, redhead?

01:32:58.323 --> 01:33:02.326
- Nope. Blond.
- Oh. I like the redheads.

01:33:02.327 --> 01:33:05.746
There's a redhead
lives on the floor below me.

01:33:05.747 --> 01:33:08.373
What a dish! I keep thinking,

01:33:08.374 --> 01:33:13.003
I'll get off the elevator at the
wrong floor, but I never do.

01:33:13.004 --> 01:33:14.505
Why not? Why don't you?

01:33:14.506 --> 01:33:18.131
And have my wife make
a cripple out of me for life?

01:33:19.344 --> 01:33:24.014
One shoe off,
and the other shoe off.

01:33:24.015 --> 01:33:29.061
Diddle, diddle, dumpling
my son John

01:33:29.062 --> 01:33:32.022
Hey, that don't rhyme
like it used to.

01:33:32.023 --> 01:33:35.359
Did I ever tell you about Eleanor?
She's a girl I went to school with.

01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:37.778
- Yes. I know. I know.
- Wonderful!

01:33:37.779 --> 01:33:41.404
Just the girl for you.
Wonderful girl.

01:33:54.879 --> 01:33:57.256
Look, bobbylocks,
don't worry about me.

01:33:57.257 --> 01:34:01.883
Anytime I want to throw in the sponge,
you'll know it. I just won't be around.

01:34:59.903 --> 01:35:02.821
- You about ready?
- Yes. See you next year.

01:35:02.822 --> 01:35:05.282
Yes, indeed. We'll be here.
Take good care of yourself.

01:35:05.283 --> 01:35:06.783
We will.

01:35:06.784 --> 01:35:08.531
All right, son, get aboard.

01:35:14.292 --> 01:35:16.119
- Bye!
- Bye!

01:35:20.632 --> 01:35:24.801
I can't remember when
I've been as tired.

01:35:24.802 --> 01:35:26.845
It's that resting
you did at the fair, Ma.

01:35:26.846 --> 01:35:29.469
Three days' rest
will tire anybody out.

01:35:30.266 --> 01:35:33.685
- Good-bye, Hank!
- Good-bye, Frake! See you next year.

01:35:33.686 --> 01:35:34.933
You bet.

01:35:55.124 --> 01:35:57.793
For goodness sake,
what's the matter, Margy?

01:35:57.794 --> 01:36:00.629
You're crying like there was
never gonna be another fair.

01:36:00.630 --> 01:36:02.756
We'll be back next year.

01:36:02.757 --> 01:36:07.511
- I never want to see another fair.
- You can say that again.

01:36:07.512 --> 01:36:09.429
You meet a lot of people
who play you for a sucker

01:36:09.430 --> 01:36:11.431
and have some laughs
at your expense.

01:36:11.432 --> 01:36:13.851
When the fair's over, what?

01:36:14.310 --> 01:36:16.603
Just chalk it up to
experience, I guess.

01:36:16.604 --> 01:36:20.190
Sure, that's why you go
to a fair, experience.

01:36:20.191 --> 01:36:22.359
Something new, different.

01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:26.863
Yes, sir, the Frakes are
coming home in grand style.

01:36:26.864 --> 01:36:29.449
You got your plaque,
I got the grand award,

01:36:29.450 --> 01:36:33.412
we're all well and happy, and
Dave Miller owes me five bucks.

01:36:39.335 --> 01:36:43.171
There you are. That's Melissa's
plaque for mincemeat.

01:36:43.172 --> 01:36:46.758
And this is mine. First prize
for the best boar in the state.

01:36:46.759 --> 01:36:50.095
So, you see, Gloomy Gus,
you lost your bet.

01:36:50.096 --> 01:36:53.098
Nobody got sick and nothing
bad happened to any of us.

01:36:53.099 --> 01:36:56.560
Only thing is, something might have
happened we don't know about.

01:36:56.561 --> 01:36:59.605
None of that now.
Come across. $5.00.

01:37:01.566 --> 01:37:04.401
- Lemonade, Mr. Miller?
- Yes!

01:37:04.402 --> 01:37:08.238
Thank you, Mrs. Frake.
Believe I will.

01:37:08.239 --> 01:37:11.325
Would have done your heart good
to hear 'em in church this morning.

01:37:11.326 --> 01:37:15.037
Everybody talking about the Frakes
and all the prizes you won.

01:37:15.038 --> 01:37:17.414
Well, that's nice.

01:37:17.415 --> 01:37:20.834
See you later. I won't
be home for dinner.

01:37:20.835 --> 01:37:23.670
- All right, son.
- Where are you going?

01:37:23.671 --> 01:37:25.623
Oh, just for a little drive.

01:37:28.593 --> 01:37:32.304
Did Wayne have a good time?
He looks a little down.

01:37:32.305 --> 01:37:34.556
Had the time of his life,
far as I can make out.

01:37:34.557 --> 01:37:35.932
Mr. Miller. Abel?

01:37:35.933 --> 01:37:37.806
No, not now, Ma.

01:37:41.272 --> 01:37:43.145
Headache better, dear?

01:37:47.987 --> 01:37:50.614
How about you, Margy?

01:37:50.615 --> 01:37:53.116
Did you have
a good time at the fair?

01:37:57.580 --> 01:37:58.872
Answer that, Margy.

01:37:58.873 --> 01:38:01.826
It's probably Harry for you.

01:38:03.086 --> 01:38:05.796
Well, go on, dear.
Don't let it ring all day.

01:38:11.552 --> 01:38:15.973
- Well?
- Let's not be hasty about this now.

01:38:18.017 --> 01:38:19.434
Hello?

01:38:19.977 --> 01:38:22.562
Doesn't anybody ever answer
the telephone at your house?

01:38:22.563 --> 01:38:25.857
Pat! Oh, Pat!

01:38:25.858 --> 01:38:28.152
Here? In Brunswick?

01:38:29.904 --> 01:38:33.198
Oh, yes. Yes, I do. I do, Pat!

01:38:33.199 --> 01:38:36.868
That's all I wanna know. 'Cause
you're going back to Chicago with me.

01:38:36.869 --> 01:38:38.954
You're gonna be the wife
of a columnist.

01:38:38.955 --> 01:38:41.456
Yeah. How do I drive
out to your place?

01:38:41.457 --> 01:38:46.128
Where are you now? Is your car pointed
toward the hotel or the Elk's hall?

01:38:46.129 --> 01:38:48.547
Well, get in and keep it
going in that direction.

01:38:48.548 --> 01:38:52.050
Just keep going until you see me.
Oh, yes, and hurry!

01:38:52.051 --> 01:38:54.379
Hurry! Hurry.

01:38:55.471 --> 01:38:58.682
Margy, you didn't
answer my question.

01:38:58.683 --> 01:39:00.809
Did you have
a good time at the fair?

01:39:00.810 --> 01:39:06.106
Oh, yes, Mr. Miller! It was the most
wonderful fair in the whole world!

01:39:06.107 --> 01:39:07.399
There!

01:39:08.359 --> 01:39:10.982
You see? What did I tell you?

01:39:11.863 --> 01:39:14.361
Margy! Margy!
That's Mr. Miller's car!

01:39:17.785 --> 01:39:19.494
Well!

01:39:19.495 --> 01:39:21.572
She'll be right back, I'm sure.

01:39:23.749 --> 01:39:25.075
$5.00.

01:39:48.774 --> 01:39:50.021
Oh, Pat!

01:39:51.444 --> 01:39:53.904
Hi!

01:39:53.905 --> 01:39:55.197
Hi!

01:39:56.991 --> 01:40:01.161
It's a grand night for singing

01:40:01.162 --> 01:40:04.873
The stars are bright above

01:40:04.874 --> 01:40:08.627
The earth is aglow and
to add to the show

01:40:08.628 --> 01:40:12.506
I think I am falling in love

01:40:12.507 --> 01:40:14.591
Falling

01:40:14.592 --> 01:40:18.092
Falling in love
