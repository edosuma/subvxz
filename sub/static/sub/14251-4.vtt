01:08.034 --> 01:10.298
Don't move!

03:16.196 --> 03:17.754
What's this?

03:17.830 --> 03:19.127
We found him in the trunks

03:19.199 --> 03:21.224
a hundred footfalls
past Grove Yellow.

03:21.301 --> 03:22.290
Arms?

03:22.368 --> 03:23.460
None, sir.

03:23.536 --> 03:25.197
These colors?

03:25.271 --> 03:26.829
We didn't ask.

03:28.441 --> 03:30.238
He's no Krady beast, is he?

03:30.310 --> 03:34.303
No, sir, but he doesn't bear
Vori colors, either.

03:34.380 --> 03:36.780
Hmm...his glimpse
is too tame to be a Kradin.

03:36.849 --> 03:39.977
l hadn't fathomed that, sir.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.987
Well, fathom it now.

03:42.088 --> 03:44.056
He's no nemesis, is he?

03:46.593 --> 03:47.992
l'm not certain what he is, sir.

03:48.061 --> 03:49.892
Weren't you drilled
to fathom the nemesis?

03:49.963 --> 03:50.952
Yes, sir.

03:51.030 --> 03:53.362
And we abhor none
but the nemesis, do we?

03:53.433 --> 03:55.264
No, sir.
None but the nemesis.

03:55.335 --> 03:56.734
Then set him loose.

03:58.271 --> 04:00.136
Didn't you hear, novice?

04:11.618 --> 04:12.585
Thanks.

04:12.652 --> 04:14.051
Go take provisions.

04:19.091 --> 04:20.389
l'm sorry, sir...

04:20.459 --> 04:22.155
Go.

04:23.830 --> 04:25.923
l take it you're in charge here.

04:25.999 --> 04:28.729
Team Leader Brone,
Fourth Vori Defense Contingent.

04:28.801 --> 04:31.201
Commander Chakotay
of the Starship Voyager.

04:37.543 --> 04:39.704
Very sorry for my defenders.

04:39.779 --> 04:40.837
They're new to the clash

04:40.913 --> 04:42.813
and glimpse the nemesis
all around them.

04:42.882 --> 04:44.281
The clash?

04:44.350 --> 04:45.749
You're at war.

04:45.818 --> 04:47.615
You've strayed
into the fullness of it.

04:47.687 --> 04:49.848
That explains why my shuttle
came under fire.

04:49.922 --> 04:51.514
One of my defenders
glimpsed a vessel

04:51.591 --> 04:52.615
falling in Grove Yellow.

04:52.692 --> 04:54.159
Must've been yours.

04:56.195 --> 04:58.425
Why fly so close to this sphere?

04:58.498 --> 05:00.659
l was on a survey mission.

05:00.733 --> 05:02.394
l picked up traces
of omicron radiation

05:02.468 --> 05:04.800
in your atmosphere, so l
slowed down to take a look.

05:04.871 --> 05:07.465
As soon as l did that,
l came under attack.

05:07.540 --> 05:09.030
l lost helm control

05:09.108 --> 05:11.372
and had to make an emergency
transport to the surface.

05:11.444 --> 05:13.071
lt'll be the Kradin
who fired at you.

05:13.146 --> 05:14.113
The Kradin?

05:14.180 --> 05:16.444
Our nemesis.

05:16.516 --> 05:18.381
l see.

05:18.451 --> 05:21.477
Well, l tried to explain that l
had no hostile intentions,

05:21.554 --> 05:22.782
but they just kept shooting.

05:22.855 --> 05:25.346
The nemesis crave
supremacy in the air.

05:25.425 --> 05:27.916
They fire on any craft that
doesn't show Kradin colors.

05:27.994 --> 05:29.120
l tried to contact my ship,

05:29.195 --> 05:31.390
but my communicator's
not working.

05:31.464 --> 05:33.022
All dispatching
in the clash zone

05:33.099 --> 05:34.088
has been suppressed.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.727
l have to find my vessel.

05:36.803 --> 05:38.065
Maybe it's salvageable.

05:38.137 --> 05:39.434
That's little likely.

05:39.505 --> 05:41.939
We're ordered to cluster
with the Seventh Contingent

05:42.008 --> 05:42.940
two new lights from now.

05:43.009 --> 05:44.943
They'll have means
to signal your people.

05:45.011 --> 05:46.945
You can make the walk
with us to meet them.

05:47.013 --> 05:49.675
l appreciate the offer,
but l can't wait two days.

05:49.749 --> 05:51.307
l have to find my vessel now.

05:51.384 --> 05:53.409
lt wouldn't be sharp
to return to the trunks.

05:53.486 --> 05:55.784
The nemesis is everywhere there.

05:57.156 --> 05:59.522
Then l'll have to do my best
to steer clear of them.

06:00.560 --> 06:02.221
lf your tactic won't change...

06:02.295 --> 06:04.559
lt won't.

06:06.799 --> 06:08.994
lt's sharper to wait
for the new light.

06:13.005 --> 06:15.098
Then l'll take
your advice and wait.

06:28.020 --> 06:29.954
Well done.

06:51.744 --> 06:53.439
Provisions?

06:56.916 --> 06:58.884
lt's not so savory.

06:58.951 --> 07:00.885
Thanks.
l'm sure it'll be fine.

07:03.623 --> 07:05.523
They call me Rafin.

07:05.591 --> 07:06.649
Chakotay.

07:06.726 --> 07:08.125
Pleased to meet you.

07:09.629 --> 07:11.324
ln the trunks, di...

07:11.397 --> 07:12.694
did you glimpse any?

07:14.267 --> 07:15.859
Any what?

07:15.935 --> 07:17.402
Krady beasts.

07:19.705 --> 07:21.070
No, l didn't.

07:21.140 --> 07:25.008
Rafin's never glimpsed
the face of the nemesis, either.

07:25.077 --> 07:27.011
Have you, Rafin?

07:27.079 --> 07:28.876
No.

07:31.184 --> 07:33.914
lt's my first walk
in the clash zone.

07:33.986 --> 07:35.886
You'll glimpse them
in the soonafter.

07:37.156 --> 07:38.555
When you do, you'll fathom

07:38.624 --> 07:41.115
there's no heart thumping
beneath their flesh.

07:47.166 --> 07:50.135
How many beasts will you send
to the Wayafter, Rafin?

07:50.203 --> 07:53.969
l...l couldn't say.

07:54.040 --> 07:55.530
Me, l'll nullify one

07:55.608 --> 07:58.338
for each brother and cousin
that l've lost.

07:59.879 --> 08:01.574
And then one more after.

08:01.681 --> 08:04.275
True or not, my allies?

08:04.317 --> 08:06.376
True.
True.

08:07.720 --> 08:10.280
So l ask you again, Rafin.

08:10.356 --> 08:12.381
How many will you nullify?

08:12.458 --> 08:14.756
As man...as many as l'm able.

08:18.064 --> 08:20.862
You've got the trembles.

08:20.933 --> 08:23.993
lf you don't wrestle
your trembles to rages, ally,

08:24.070 --> 08:26.595
the nemesis'll nullify you.

08:33.613 --> 08:35.342
This nemesis of yours--

08:35.414 --> 08:37.813
why do you call them beasts?

08:46.325 --> 08:48.725
lt's told they all wear
the same horrid face.

08:51.664 --> 08:54.758
Their flesh...
is gnarled and blistery

08:54.834 --> 08:56.825
like the rotting trunks.

08:58.504 --> 09:00.904
Their glimpses flame like fire.

09:03.309 --> 09:06.142
And if you dare near enough,
their breath stinks of muck.

09:06.212 --> 09:08.976
You know, sometimes
people say terrible things

09:09.048 --> 09:10.208
about their enemies,

09:10.283 --> 09:12.649
to make them seem worse
than they really are.

09:12.718 --> 09:15.346
There might be some
young Kradin soldier out there

09:15.421 --> 09:17.821
who's more afraid of you
than you are of him.

09:19.959 --> 09:22.655
Nemesis wasn't scared
to fume my village...

09:22.728 --> 09:26.459
nor scared to nullify my cousins
and brothers in their sleep.

09:29.101 --> 09:32.332
And my old mother's mother,
too...

09:32.405 --> 09:35.841
who never told an unkind word,
nor nullified an insect

09:35.908 --> 09:38.570
in all her days and nights
on this sphere.

09:38.644 --> 09:40.669
That's pretty rough.

09:42.148 --> 09:43.376
And who but a Krady beast

09:43.449 --> 09:46.475
would leave the nullified bodies
of mine and ours upturned...

09:46.552 --> 09:50.648
so they'll never descend
to the gloried Wayafter.

09:50.723 --> 09:52.748
What do you mean by"upturned"?

09:52.825 --> 09:54.087
Which of you will walk
with Chakotay

09:54.160 --> 09:55.718
to find his craft
when the new light comes?

09:55.795 --> 09:59.595
l appreciate the offer,
but l'll be fine on my own.

09:59.665 --> 10:02.133
You don't fathom the trunks
and you don't carry arms.

10:02.201 --> 10:04.135
One of my defenders
will walk with you.

10:04.203 --> 10:05.693
Which will it be?

10:05.871 --> 10:07.862
You, Rafin?

10:07.940 --> 10:10.408
S- Sir, l...l...

10:10.476 --> 10:12.842
l'll walk with the stranger,
sir.

10:12.912 --> 10:16.814
lf any beast comes to clash,
l'll nullify the beast.

10:16.882 --> 10:18.247
Well told, Namon.

10:18.317 --> 10:20.308
Now close your glimpses,
Defenders...

10:20.386 --> 10:23.355
and dream of your sisters
and mothers.

10:40.406 --> 10:42.966
Have you never nullified
another, stranger?

10:43.042 --> 10:46.637
Killing's the worst thing
l've ever had to do.

10:46.712 --> 10:48.873
Then the nemesis you nullified

10:48.948 --> 10:51.712
wasn't half so beastly
as the Kradin.

10:51.784 --> 10:54.048
Maybe not.

10:54.120 --> 10:57.419
ln their glimpses,
we're less than nothing.

10:57.490 --> 11:00.687
They flame our homes,
take our plantings...

11:00.760 --> 11:03.786
make playthings of our sisters.

11:03.863 --> 11:04.795
lf you were a Vori,

11:04.864 --> 11:07.025
you'd crave to drive them
from this sphere

11:07.099 --> 11:08.726
just as l do.

11:08.801 --> 11:10.393
Maybe l would

11:10.469 --> 11:13.438
if they did things like that
to the people l loved.

11:13.506 --> 11:16.339
But on the sphere l come from,

11:16.409 --> 11:20.140
we try to find other ways
to resolve differences--

11:20.212 --> 11:23.147
peaceful solutions,
negotiations.

11:25.151 --> 11:27.711
You don't fathom the nemesis.

11:27.787 --> 11:31.223
No. l suppose l don't.

11:32.692 --> 11:37.561
Beg the Power you believe in
that you never will.

11:47.006 --> 11:48.439
The light will be old soon.

11:48.507 --> 11:50.998
We'd be sharp to cluster
with the others.

11:51.077 --> 11:52.044
ln a few minutes.

11:52.111 --> 11:53.510
We should be getting close.

11:53.579 --> 11:56.173
You'd be sharp
to do my tellings.

11:56.248 --> 11:58.182
Go back if you want to.

11:58.250 --> 11:59.683
l've got to keep looking.

11:59.752 --> 12:01.242
No, wait.

12:03.255 --> 12:05.416
l pledged to walk with you.

12:07.259 --> 12:08.487
Glimpse there.

12:16.068 --> 12:18.195
Doesn't look like there's
much left of my shuttle.

12:18.270 --> 12:20.135
You'll have to make
the walk with us

12:20.206 --> 12:21.537
to the Seventh Contingent.

12:28.380 --> 12:30.245
Don't make me kill you!

12:45.397 --> 12:46.762
How is he?

12:49.802 --> 12:51.565
Nullified.

12:59.912 --> 13:02.813
We beg peace from the Power
who made us Vori

13:02.915 --> 13:09.582
and we commend our brother,
Namon, to the gloried Wayafter.

13:43.522 --> 13:44.887
What's this?

13:44.957 --> 13:46.982
Namon's coverings.

13:47.059 --> 13:50.324
Shouldn't they go to his family
or someone he was close to?

13:50.396 --> 13:52.193
lt's a long walk
to the clustermark.

13:52.264 --> 13:54.562
lt's sharper to blend
with the trunks.

13:54.633 --> 13:57.466
Your fleet colors will
get us all nullified.

14:01.173 --> 14:03.471
l'm sorry about
what happened to Namon.

14:03.542 --> 14:06.340
The nemesis has nullified
mine and ours in the before

14:06.412 --> 14:09.040
and will in the now.

14:09.114 --> 14:12.709
But in the soonafter...

14:12.785 --> 14:16.016
we'll send them flying
from this sphere

14:16.088 --> 14:18.886
and go back to our sisters
and mothers.

14:21.460 --> 14:23.325
Take it.

14:23.395 --> 14:25.329
This isn't my war.

14:25.397 --> 14:26.921
l'm not planning
to shoot anybody.

14:26.999 --> 14:29.399
lf we greet the nemesis
in the trunks, you'll fire

14:29.468 --> 14:30.628
like the rest.

14:31.770 --> 14:33.237
As long as you're with us,

14:33.305 --> 14:34.863
you do my tellings, fathom?

14:39.378 --> 14:40.902
Fathom.

14:42.448 --> 14:43.472
Rafin.

14:43.549 --> 14:45.483
Yes, sir?

14:45.551 --> 14:48.611
Drill Chakotay
to fire Vori arms.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.088
Now you.

15:04.937 --> 15:06.768
Your glimpse is too low.

15:06.839 --> 15:10.275
With these arms, it's sharper
to aim higher than the mark.

15:17.216 --> 15:18.706
You're good.

15:18.784 --> 15:21.150
Don't mock me.

15:21.220 --> 15:23.120
l was paying you a compliment.

15:23.188 --> 15:25.816
lt is one matter
to fire at clay marks,

15:25.891 --> 15:28.826
but much another
to nullify the nemesis.

15:28.894 --> 15:32.489
That's what Namon told,
and he told the truth

15:32.564 --> 15:34.589
before he went
to the gloried Wayafter.

15:34.667 --> 15:36.100
He was right.

15:36.168 --> 15:37.567
Killing's not easy.

15:40.105 --> 15:41.970
Risking my own days and nights

15:42.074 --> 15:43.598
to drive the nemesis
from our sphere...

15:45.978 --> 15:48.970
that should be as easy
as a long sleep.

15:49.048 --> 15:51.642
Who taught you that?

15:51.717 --> 15:55.881
My brothers and uncles
who were in the clash...

15:55.955 --> 15:58.753
Brone, my driller...

16:02.027 --> 16:05.827
and Namon, my ally...

16:05.898 --> 16:08.458
who was nullified because of me.

16:10.836 --> 16:12.963
You think it's your
fault that Namon died?

16:13.038 --> 16:14.505
lf l didn't have
the coward's trembles,

16:14.573 --> 16:16.564
l would have walked with you
in the trunks...

16:16.642 --> 16:20.840
and it would be me and not he
who went to the Wayafter.

16:20.913 --> 16:22.904
You weren't the one
who pulled the trigger, Rafin,

16:22.982 --> 16:26.076
and there's no shame
in being afraid of fighting.

16:26.151 --> 16:28.119
Having the trembles is natural.

16:29.388 --> 16:30.878
How do you fathom that?

16:30.956 --> 16:32.617
Because l've been
in battle before,

16:32.691 --> 16:34.488
fighting to free my people

16:34.560 --> 16:37.028
from a nemesis called
the Cardassians.

16:38.897 --> 16:41.058
These Cardassians...

16:41.133 --> 16:43.567
were they beasts?

16:43.635 --> 16:46.866
Let's just say they
weren't very friendly.

16:46.939 --> 16:48.907
The point is,

16:48.974 --> 16:51.408
even though l believed
in what we were doing,

16:51.477 --> 16:53.877
l always felt fear
before a fight.

16:53.946 --> 16:57.814
But you wrestled your trembles
to rages, didn't you?

16:59.618 --> 17:01.347
l guess l did,

17:01.453 --> 17:02.442
but that doesn't mean...

17:02.488 --> 17:04.479
l was told to drill you,
Chakotay,

17:04.556 --> 17:07.423
but it's you who've drilled me--

17:07.492 --> 17:10.189
drilled me to fathom the rages.

17:50.836 --> 17:52.360
Brone.

17:52.438 --> 17:53.632
What is it?

17:53.705 --> 17:54.797
l don't know.

18:05.651 --> 18:07.642
Neck- strapped and upturned.

18:07.719 --> 18:11.416
Left to be cooked by the glare.

18:11.490 --> 18:13.082
He's one of yours?

18:13.158 --> 18:15.126
By his coverings,
he's of the Seventh Contingent.

18:15.194 --> 18:16.855
Likely a scoutwalker.

18:16.929 --> 18:19.864
Desecrated by the Kradin.

18:19.932 --> 18:22.594
He'll never turn his face
to the Wayafter.

18:22.668 --> 18:24.829
We're 300 footfalls
from the clustermark.

18:24.903 --> 18:26.530
Signal the Seventh.

18:33.445 --> 18:35.379
Again.

18:39.284 --> 18:40.751
Why don't they answer?

18:40.819 --> 18:42.912
ls it possible they moved
their camp for some reason?

18:42.988 --> 18:44.080
Little likely.

18:44.156 --> 18:45.555
You two fastwalk
to the clustermark

18:45.624 --> 18:46.613
and glimpse what you can.

18:46.692 --> 18:47.624
Sir.

18:47.693 --> 18:48.853
What?

18:48.927 --> 18:50.258
Let me go.

18:52.831 --> 18:54.560
Well told, novice.

18:54.633 --> 18:57.602
Keep your top low
and your glimpse wide.

19:14.419 --> 19:15.408
Sir!

19:17.789 --> 19:20.087
What have you glimpsed?

19:20.159 --> 19:24.152
The Seventh Contingent, sir,
nullified.

19:24.229 --> 19:26.424
What? All of them?

19:26.498 --> 19:28.193
At least 20 defenders

19:28.267 --> 19:31.464
and that's not
the whole terrible of it.

19:31.537 --> 19:34.005
They're all...

19:35.440 --> 19:37.237
they're all...

19:37.309 --> 19:38.970
Tell it, Rafin.
They're all how?

19:40.045 --> 19:41.842
Like him, sir.

19:41.914 --> 19:44.041
Upturned.

19:44.116 --> 19:46.243
Staked to the dirt and upturned.

19:46.318 --> 19:48.809
Those motherless Krady beasts.

19:52.391 --> 19:55.121
Do you glimpse the fullness
of it now, stranger?

19:56.428 --> 19:59.192
Yes. l think l do.

19:59.264 --> 20:02.290
Now you fathom why we name
them beasts and not men.

20:04.303 --> 20:05.463
l'm sorry.

20:06.838 --> 20:10.137
We're much more than sorry...

20:10.209 --> 20:12.074
aren't we, Defenders?

20:12.144 --> 20:13.577
Yes, sir!

20:13.645 --> 20:16.773
The nemesis
wants your plantings.

20:16.848 --> 20:19.112
True.

20:19.184 --> 20:22.312
He wants your homes.

20:22.387 --> 20:26.323
He wants your sisters,

20:26.391 --> 20:28.985
but does it suffice him
to nullify you?

20:29.061 --> 20:29.993
No!

20:30.062 --> 20:32.326
No. He craves to shame you,

20:32.397 --> 20:35.798
mock you, keep you from
the gloried Wayafter!

20:35.867 --> 20:37.425
We're wearied of it,
aren't we?

20:37.502 --> 20:38.491
Yes, sir!

20:38.570 --> 20:40.936
We're wrestled to the rages
for it, aren't we?

20:41.006 --> 20:41.973
Yes, sir!

20:42.040 --> 20:44.008
And we're not going
to swallow it--

20:44.142 --> 20:47.339
not in the now,
or in the soonafter!

20:50.616 --> 20:52.447
Assault!

20:52.517 --> 20:55.782
Sly yourselves and fire back!

21:19.478 --> 21:20.638
Motherless beasts!

21:20.712 --> 21:22.475
Rafin, no! Stay down!

21:22.547 --> 21:24.742
l'll nullify you all!

21:30.255 --> 21:31.222
Hold on.

21:31.290 --> 21:33.258
l'm going to get you
out of here.

21:42.100 --> 21:43.465
Please...

21:43.535 --> 21:46.993
turn my face to the...Wayafter.

22:42.260 --> 22:43.887
A defender.

22:43.962 --> 22:45.190
Mark, neighbors.

22:45.263 --> 22:47.128
A defender!

22:50.402 --> 22:53.496
Welcome to Larhana settlement,
gloried defender.

22:53.572 --> 22:56.132
You're brightly greeted.

23:04.182 --> 23:07.913
Captain's Log, Stardate 51082. 4.

23:08.019 --> 23:10.317
After searching
for more than two days,

23:10.389 --> 23:12.448
we've finally located
what's left

23:12.524 --> 23:14.515
of Commander Chakotay's shuttle.

23:14.593 --> 23:16.151
l can only hope the Commander

23:16.228 --> 23:18.856
has fared better
than his vessel.

23:18.930 --> 23:20.864
According to the Ambassador,
Commander Chakotay's

23:20.932 --> 23:23.662
shuttle was hit by enemy fire
and crash- landed

23:23.735 --> 23:25.327
somewhere
on the southernmost continent.

23:25.404 --> 23:26.871
Right in the middle
of the war zone.

23:26.938 --> 23:27.905
l'm afraid so.

23:27.973 --> 23:29.065
Can we get a lock on him?

23:29.141 --> 23:31.302
There's too much atmospheric
radiation from weapons fire.

23:31.376 --> 23:32.536
We can't scan the surface.

23:32.611 --> 23:34.169
Which means, we don't know
if he's still alive.

23:34.246 --> 23:35.713
Why don't we assume
that he still is?

23:35.781 --> 23:36.975
l should have gone with him.

23:37.048 --> 23:37.980
lt's not your fault, Tom.

23:38.049 --> 23:39.209
We couldn't
have anticipated this.

23:39.284 --> 23:40.251
What we've got to do now

23:40.318 --> 23:41.512
is figure out
how to deal with it.

23:41.586 --> 23:43.554
B'Elanna, try to modify
the scanners,

23:43.622 --> 23:45.249
cut through the interference.

23:45.323 --> 23:46.255
Aye, Captain.

23:46.324 --> 23:48.849
Neelix, what do you know
about this war?

23:48.927 --> 23:50.326
lt's vicious.

23:50.395 --> 23:53.091
Ambassador Treen's people
have been defending themselves

23:53.165 --> 23:54.996
against a particularly
savage aggressor

23:55.066 --> 23:56.226
for more than a decade.

23:56.301 --> 23:58.462
ls the Ambassador willing
to help us find Chakotay?

23:58.537 --> 24:01.131
He's willing,
but he may not be able.

24:01.206 --> 24:03.174
His resources
are extremely limited

24:03.241 --> 24:05.232
and the situation
on the surface is chaotic.

24:05.310 --> 24:06.368
But he's assured me

24:06.445 --> 24:08.208
that if his troops
do find Chakotay,

24:08.280 --> 24:09.872
he'll receive medical attention

24:09.948 --> 24:12.075
and be transported
to the nearest command post.

24:12.150 --> 24:13.310
Let's hope he doesn't meet up

24:13.385 --> 24:14.909
with these"savage
aggressors" first.

24:14.986 --> 24:16.010
Captain, let me lead

24:16.087 --> 24:17.577
a team down there
and bring him back.

24:17.656 --> 24:18.918
l understand how you feel, Tom,

24:18.990 --> 24:20.685
but let's take it
one step at a time.

24:20.759 --> 24:22.750
Tuvok, recontact
Ambassador Treen.

24:22.828 --> 24:25.058
Ask for any tactical support
he's willing to provide--

24:25.130 --> 24:27.564
maps, weapons analyses,
intelligence reports.

24:27.632 --> 24:30.533
Before l risk
anyone else's life,

24:30.602 --> 24:31.534
l want to know exactly

24:31.603 --> 24:32.968
what we're getting
ourselves into.

24:36.308 --> 24:39.744
By your coverings,
you're a novice defender.

24:39.811 --> 24:42.245
Do l tell the truth?

24:42.314 --> 24:45.078
Listen, there's been
a misunderstanding.

24:45.150 --> 24:46.742
l'm not a defender.

24:46.818 --> 24:48.752
My shuttle was shot down
by the Kradin

24:48.820 --> 24:50.651
and l landed in the clash zone.

24:50.722 --> 24:52.781
l met up
with one of your patrols.

24:52.858 --> 24:54.257
They gave me this uniform.

24:54.326 --> 24:55.520
Which Contingent?

24:55.594 --> 24:57.528
The Fourth.

24:57.596 --> 24:59.655
The Fourth?

24:59.731 --> 25:01.255
They're sturdy clashers.

25:01.366 --> 25:04.335
Tell us--
did you and your allies

25:04.369 --> 25:07.099
drive the nemesis
from the trunks?

25:07.172 --> 25:09.072
We put up a brave fight.

25:09.140 --> 25:13.304
Then you're a gloried defender
even if you claim not to be.

25:13.378 --> 25:15.437
Marna tells the truth, Chakotay.

25:15.514 --> 25:18.347
You are welcome
among my neighbors.

25:18.416 --> 25:20.179
Thank you.

25:20.252 --> 25:22.743
That's very kind.

25:22.821 --> 25:24.652
Do you crave anything more?

25:24.723 --> 25:26.748
Drink? Warm coverings?

25:26.825 --> 25:29.419
What l really need is
some communications equipment

25:29.494 --> 25:30.654
to contact my crew.

25:30.729 --> 25:33.323
We have no means
to signal your people.

25:33.398 --> 25:35.923
The Kradin drove us
from our homes

25:36.034 --> 25:38.764
and plantings and took
all the machinery we had.

25:38.837 --> 25:40.464
Do you know
where l might find someplace

25:40.539 --> 25:41.904
with communications equipment?

25:43.642 --> 25:44.973
The Restock Unit.

25:45.043 --> 25:46.340
Can you tell me
how to get there?

25:46.411 --> 25:49.244
lt's not very near--
at least 10, 000 footfalls

25:49.314 --> 25:50.975
through the thick
of the trunks.

25:51.082 --> 25:53.448
Then l'd better get started.

25:54.920 --> 25:56.649
The new light is coming.

25:56.721 --> 25:57.710
Rest till then.

25:57.789 --> 25:59.222
Yes, please, Chakotay.

25:59.291 --> 26:01.156
Rest until the new light.

26:03.495 --> 26:05.486
l think l will.

26:08.700 --> 26:10.190
Come, neighbors.

26:10.268 --> 26:12.793
Let's give Defender Chakotay
some quiet.

26:33.625 --> 26:36.025
l wanted to know
if you crave more.

26:39.698 --> 26:41.165
No, thank you.

26:41.232 --> 26:43.496
Oh.

26:43.568 --> 26:45.365
But it was delicious.

26:47.072 --> 26:48.733
And the blossoms?

26:48.807 --> 26:49.933
Do you like them?

26:50.008 --> 26:52.203
l planted them myself.

26:52.277 --> 26:54.268
They're very pretty.

26:55.847 --> 26:57.474
l've heard tellings
that the Kradin

26:57.549 --> 26:59.813
leave our nullied defenders
upturned.

26:59.884 --> 27:01.749
ls it true?

27:03.221 --> 27:04.688
You can tell me.

27:04.756 --> 27:08.590
Penno says l'm too small
to be told, but l'm not.

27:08.660 --> 27:12.096
lt's true the Kradin
don't respect your beliefs.

27:12.163 --> 27:13.721
The Kradin are beasty.

27:13.798 --> 27:16.392
l don't fathom
why they flamed our homes

27:16.468 --> 27:18.095
nor why they crave
to nully us all.

27:18.169 --> 27:19.500
l don't, either.

27:19.571 --> 27:22.267
We never took their plantings.

27:22.340 --> 27:24.831
We never nullied their brothers.

27:24.909 --> 27:26.706
So why do they hate us?

27:26.778 --> 27:28.439
l wish l could tell you.

27:28.513 --> 27:31.448
Hate's not something
l understand very well.

27:34.019 --> 27:36.317
My brother's a defender, too.

27:36.388 --> 27:37.548
Really?

27:37.622 --> 27:40.352
He left for the clash
two plantings before.

27:40.425 --> 27:43.690
l was much smaller then.

27:43.762 --> 27:49.166
He was sturdy and pleasing
to glimpse in his colors.

27:49.234 --> 27:51.759
Like you.

27:53.538 --> 27:54.766
Maybe you've glimpsed him.

27:54.839 --> 27:56.306
He's called Daryo.

27:56.374 --> 27:58.899
There are
a lot of soldiers in the war.

27:58.977 --> 28:00.774
l only met a few of them.

28:00.879 --> 28:01.868
He's a team leader

28:01.913 --> 28:03.881
of the Seventh
Defense Contingent.

28:04.916 --> 28:06.713
The Seventh?

28:06.785 --> 28:09.117
Are you sure
he was with the Seventh?

28:09.187 --> 28:11.178
They're very sturdy
in the clash.

28:11.256 --> 28:13.224
Have you heard of them?

28:14.459 --> 28:15.426
The patrol l was with

28:15.493 --> 28:16.960
was supposed
to rendezvous with them.

28:17.028 --> 28:17.995
Why didn't you?

28:18.063 --> 28:19.621
You would have glimpsed him.

28:21.066 --> 28:22.829
We were ambushed
before we had the chance.

28:22.901 --> 28:25.461
But when you go back
to the clash

28:25.537 --> 28:27.869
likely you'll glimpse
Daryo then.

28:27.972 --> 28:30.440
You could take a letter to him.

28:30.508 --> 28:33.272
l'm not going back
to the clash zone.

28:33.344 --> 28:35.312
l've got to get
to the Restock Unit

28:35.380 --> 28:36.847
so l can contact my ship.

28:36.915 --> 28:39.406
Then you can bring my letter
to the Restock Unit.

28:39.484 --> 28:42.146
Likely some defender there
can take it to Daryo.

28:42.220 --> 28:43.881
Will you do it?

28:43.955 --> 28:45.786
Please?

28:49.461 --> 28:52.021
l'll go write it now
before the new light comes.

29:04.909 --> 29:06.308
l wish you a good day.

29:06.377 --> 29:07.503
Thank you.

29:07.579 --> 29:10.412
Provisions for your long walk.

29:10.482 --> 29:12.950
Walk well, Defender Chakotay.

29:13.017 --> 29:14.507
Thank you both.

29:14.586 --> 29:17.077
You've all been very kind.

29:21.226 --> 29:22.716
Writings for my brother.

29:22.794 --> 29:24.853
You'll be sure he gets them?

29:24.929 --> 29:26.988
l'll do my best.

29:27.065 --> 29:29.033
Your best will be enough.

29:29.100 --> 29:32.866
The pretty smell of the blossoms
will hold the nemesis far away.

29:35.039 --> 29:36.802
Then you'd better
keep one for yourself.

30:28.660 --> 30:29.752
Father!

30:48.246 --> 30:51.545
Offer no opposition
or you'll be nullified.

31:07.265 --> 31:10.325
No evidence of cellular residue
on the shuttle wreckage,

31:10.401 --> 31:13.165
so there's a chance
Chakotay survived the crash.

31:13.238 --> 31:14.796
Well, unfortunately,
the wreckage was found

31:14.873 --> 31:16.272
inside enemy territory.

31:16.341 --> 31:17.603
So there is also a chance

31:17.675 --> 31:20.337
he's been captured
or killed by the nemesis.

31:20.411 --> 31:22.709
There you go looking
on the bright side again, Tuvok.

31:23.715 --> 31:25.444
What's this"nemesis"?

31:25.516 --> 31:26.983
lt is the term
Ambassador Treen's people

31:27.051 --> 31:28.279
use to identify their enemy.

31:28.353 --> 31:29.513
Apparently, they're vicious.

31:29.587 --> 31:31.282
They shoot without warning,

31:31.356 --> 31:34.382
use biochemical weapons,
routinely massacre civilians.

31:34.459 --> 31:36.450
lf we run into them,
it's safe to say

31:36.527 --> 31:38.392
they won't be hanging out
a welcome sign.

31:39.464 --> 31:41.432
l want a team on the surface
as soon as possible.

31:41.499 --> 31:42.431
l was hoping you'd say that.

31:42.500 --> 31:43.432
Tuvok, let's get moving.

31:43.501 --> 31:44.763
l must caution you both.

31:44.836 --> 31:46.827
My tactical analysis
does not bode well

31:46.905 --> 31:48.668
for the success
of such a mission.

31:48.740 --> 31:50.674
Given the situation
in the battle zone,

31:50.742 --> 31:52.733
there is
a very high probability

31:52.810 --> 31:55.278
that an away team
will sustain heavy casualties.

31:55.346 --> 31:58.042
Are you saying we should
just abandon Chakotay?

31:58.116 --> 31:59.208
On the contrary.

31:59.284 --> 32:01.275
l suppose you've come up
with an alternative plan?

32:01.386 --> 32:02.318
lndeed.

32:02.353 --> 32:04.184
l have concluded
that the least risky

32:04.255 --> 32:06.485
course of action is for
a single crew member

32:06.557 --> 32:07.854
to make the infiltration,

32:07.926 --> 32:09.791
accompanied by a commando unit

32:09.861 --> 32:11.795
that Ambassador Treen
has agreed to provide.

32:11.863 --> 32:14.730
Fine with me.
When do l leave?

32:14.799 --> 32:18.326
Something tells me that's
not what Tuvok has in mind.

32:18.403 --> 32:20.496
Naturally, l am
the logical person

32:20.571 --> 32:21.936
to carry out this mission.

32:23.741 --> 32:25.299
Naturally.

32:31.649 --> 32:32.616
Get down there!

32:32.684 --> 32:33.844
Chakotay!

32:37.989 --> 32:39.752
l heard the explosions.

32:39.824 --> 32:41.985
l came back to help.

32:42.060 --> 32:44.585
What did the Kradin do to you?

32:46.397 --> 32:48.126
They interrogated me.

32:51.202 --> 32:52.692
Where's your grandfather?

32:52.770 --> 32:54.237
l don't know.

32:54.305 --> 32:57.433
He's very gray,
and his heart's not sturdy.

32:57.508 --> 32:59.533
He needs me to tend him.

33:01.446 --> 33:02.913
You!

33:06.150 --> 33:08.880
You! l want to talk
to your superior!

33:10.188 --> 33:11.177
Hey!

33:11.255 --> 33:12.779
l'm talking to you.
l want to know

33:12.857 --> 33:14.654
what you've done
with this girl's grandfather.

33:14.726 --> 33:15.693
He's old and needs medical...

33:16.561 --> 33:18.290
Chakotay!

33:20.965 --> 33:22.865
Penno always tells
it'll be brighter

33:22.934 --> 33:24.299
when the new light comes.

33:26.637 --> 33:28.332
Your grandfather is a wise man.

33:38.449 --> 33:40.212
That's right.

33:40.284 --> 33:41.774
Now get some sleep.

33:41.853 --> 33:43.844
You'll tend me, won't you?

33:43.921 --> 33:45.946
No matter what comes
in the soonafter?

33:48.960 --> 33:50.484
Close your glimpses...

33:52.597 --> 33:54.622
and dream
of your gloried brother.

34:11.382 --> 34:12.349
Move along, Vori.

34:12.417 --> 34:13.349
Don't shoot.

34:22.592 --> 34:24.322
We're coming.

34:25.496 --> 34:26.793
Move along!

34:31.335 --> 34:32.495
Where are they taking them?

34:32.570 --> 34:33.502
l don't know.

34:33.571 --> 34:34.868
They'll be fastwalked

34:34.938 --> 34:36.907
to the extermination facility.

34:36.974 --> 34:37.906
Why?

34:37.975 --> 34:39.237
Because they're gray

34:39.310 --> 34:40.572
and too long- lived

34:40.645 --> 34:42.976
and the Kradin think them
unfit for toiling.

34:43.081 --> 34:45.379
They won't make good servers,
like us.

34:45.449 --> 34:46.849
Penno!

34:48.252 --> 34:49.719
Penno!

34:49.786 --> 34:50.754
Karya!

34:50.822 --> 34:52.414
Where are they taking you?

34:52.489 --> 34:55.152
Be sturdy,
my daughter's daughter.

34:55.226 --> 34:56.920
Who's going to tend you?

34:56.994 --> 35:00.930
We'll glimpse each other again
in the Wayafter.

35:00.998 --> 35:02.465
- Set him loose!
- Karya!

35:02.533 --> 35:04.262
Set him loose!

35:04.335 --> 35:05.768
Be still.

35:05.837 --> 35:06.963
Keep your hands off her!

35:08.005 --> 35:09.233
Don't touch her!

35:10.108 --> 35:11.075
Halt!

35:14.011 --> 35:15.808
What's the matter, pretty one?

35:15.880 --> 35:17.313
Set my mother's father loose!

35:17.381 --> 35:19.906
ls that the man you mean?

35:19.984 --> 35:22.509
No! Karya!

35:22.587 --> 35:24.316
Please!

35:24.388 --> 35:25.855
Set him loose!

35:25.923 --> 35:29.586
You don't want to see him
suffer, do you, pretty one?

35:29.660 --> 35:30.820
No.

35:30.895 --> 35:31.919
Don't worry.

35:31.996 --> 35:34.226
The old Vori's suffering'll
be over soon enough.

35:34.298 --> 35:35.356
No!

35:35.433 --> 35:37.060
Penno!

35:37.135 --> 35:38.602
Take this screeching waif

35:38.669 --> 35:40.466
to the extermination
facility.

35:40.538 --> 35:44.235
No. Chakotay.
Set me loose!

35:44.308 --> 35:45.798
Chakotay, help me!

35:50.248 --> 35:52.716
You motherless beast!

36:03.094 --> 36:04.527
Are Ambassador Treen
and his soldiers

36:04.595 --> 36:05.527
ready to beam aboard?

36:05.596 --> 36:06.620
Aye, Captain.

36:06.697 --> 36:07.664
Energize.

36:11.469 --> 36:13.664
Welcome aboard, Ambassador.

36:13.738 --> 36:16.263
Thank you for agreeing
to help us find our crewman.

36:16.340 --> 36:18.808
Your thanks
are unnecessary, Captain.

36:18.876 --> 36:22.778
Any victim of our
bloodthirsty nemesis the Vori

36:22.847 --> 36:26.408
will always find friends
among the Kradin people.

36:40.464 --> 36:42.557
Chakotay...

36:42.633 --> 36:44.464
calm now.

36:44.535 --> 36:46.196
l'll set you loose.

36:51.676 --> 36:53.644
Sorry to leave you
upturned so long...

36:56.113 --> 36:57.740
but l had to shroud
myself in the trunks

36:57.815 --> 36:58.941
till the Kradin walked on.

37:12.897 --> 37:16.060
The villagers
from Larhana settlement?

37:16.133 --> 37:17.862
They were fastwalked
through the trunks.

37:17.969 --> 37:19.766
And your defenders?

37:21.138 --> 37:22.230
All nullified.

37:23.574 --> 37:25.633
Thank you
for coming back for me.

37:25.710 --> 37:27.473
You put yourself at risk.

37:27.545 --> 37:28.477
And you, Chakotay,

37:28.546 --> 37:30.673
clashed beside us
against the Kradin

37:30.748 --> 37:33.148
though you're a stranger
to this sphere.

37:33.217 --> 37:35.276
l glimpsed you chancing
your days and nights

37:35.353 --> 37:36.820
to save Rafin from our nemesis.

37:36.887 --> 37:40.414
You tell the truth
when you name them beasts.

37:43.294 --> 37:46.525
What will you do
now that your men are gone?

37:46.597 --> 37:48.292
Join with the Fifth Contingent.

37:48.366 --> 37:50.197
They're trying
to free the villagers.

37:50.268 --> 37:52.361
lt doesn't go brightly for them.

37:54.639 --> 37:56.163
l'll come with you.

37:56.240 --> 37:58.640
No. l'll bring you to command.

37:58.709 --> 38:00.438
You can signal your people.

38:00.544 --> 38:02.102
That can wait
till the soonafter.

38:02.146 --> 38:03.613
ln the now...

38:03.681 --> 38:06.741
you need my help
to nullify the nemesis.

38:18.262 --> 38:21.959
Backwalk!
Backwalk!

38:23.100 --> 38:24.499
The nemesis is nearing!

38:24.568 --> 38:26.092
lt's sharper to backwalk!

38:51.395 --> 38:52.453
Brone!

38:54.865 --> 38:56.162
Vori soldiers!

38:56.233 --> 38:58.201
You are surrounded.

38:58.269 --> 39:00.464
Lay down your arms
and surrender.

39:05.042 --> 39:06.532
Hold your fire!

39:06.610 --> 39:08.601
You'll have to nullify me first!

39:10.448 --> 39:13.008
Hold your fire,
Commander Chakotay.

39:14.085 --> 39:16.178
Do not fire, Commander.

39:16.253 --> 39:17.618
How do you know my name?

39:17.688 --> 39:19.383
l am Lieutenant Tuvok.

39:19.457 --> 39:22.221
Tuvok?
Don't walk any closer.

39:23.294 --> 39:25.660
l've come to bring you
back to Voyager.

39:25.730 --> 39:26.822
Nullify him, Chakotay!

39:26.897 --> 39:28.524
lt's a Kradin tactic.

39:28.599 --> 39:31.591
l assure you, Commander,
this is no ruse.

39:31.669 --> 39:32.966
lt is Lieutenant Tuvok.

39:33.037 --> 39:34.402
Don't you recognize me?

39:36.841 --> 39:38.570
He's the nemesis!

39:39.610 --> 39:41.407
You're a Kradin beast.

39:41.479 --> 39:42.537
You destroyed that village,

39:42.613 --> 39:44.911
nullified Penno;
took away Karya.

39:44.982 --> 39:46.108
She was only a child!

39:46.183 --> 39:48.583
They've brainwashed you,
Commander.

39:48.652 --> 39:50.313
Look closer.

39:52.990 --> 39:54.457
Try to recall.

39:54.525 --> 39:56.356
Your shuttle was shot down.

39:56.427 --> 40:00.295
These people-- the Vori--
they captured you.

40:00.364 --> 40:02.798
No. They rescued me.

40:02.867 --> 40:04.630
That is what they want you
to believe.

40:04.702 --> 40:07.933
But they have been
indoctrinating you, training you

40:08.038 --> 40:09.665
to fight their war.

40:09.740 --> 40:11.731
Take one more step
and l'll nullify you.

40:13.644 --> 40:17.080
You are Commander Chakotay
of the Starship Voyager.

40:17.148 --> 40:18.775
You are a scientist,

40:18.849 --> 40:20.180
an explorer.

40:20.251 --> 40:22.685
You are not a killer.

40:27.425 --> 40:28.983
Tuvok.

40:29.059 --> 40:30.526
Yes, Commander.

40:32.396 --> 40:33.988
How can you wear those colors?

40:34.064 --> 40:36.191
The Kradin...

40:36.267 --> 40:38.735
they're beasts, murderers.

40:38.803 --> 40:40.430
On the contrary--

40:40.504 --> 40:42.768
they are the ones
who helped us locate you.

40:42.840 --> 40:45.468
We tracked you
to a Vori training camp.

40:45.543 --> 40:48.478
We infiltrated the facility,
but you were gone.

40:48.546 --> 40:50.343
They had already
brought you here

40:50.414 --> 40:51.608
to fight this battle.

40:51.682 --> 40:55.345
Before today, nothing you
experienced here was real.

40:55.419 --> 40:59.355
lt is the method the Vori use
to conscript and train soldiers.

40:59.423 --> 41:00.788
l don't believe you!

41:00.891 --> 41:04.588
l will prove it to you
if you will lower your weapon.

41:34.825 --> 41:36.884
Do you recognize this place?

41:39.630 --> 41:41.154
lt's Larhana settlement.

41:56.714 --> 41:58.477
A defender.

41:58.549 --> 42:01.848
Mark, neighbors!
A defender.

42:04.321 --> 42:05.515
Defender.

42:05.589 --> 42:06.715
Karya.

42:09.560 --> 42:12.495
Welcome to Larhana settlement,
gloried defender.

42:14.164 --> 42:15.597
You're brightly greeted.

42:26.644 --> 42:30.307
Captain's Log, Stardate 51096. 5.

42:30.381 --> 42:32.315
Although Lieutenant Tuvok
has managed

42:32.383 --> 42:35.409
to bring Commander Chakotay
safely back to the ship,

42:35.486 --> 42:36.817
it may be some time

42:36.887 --> 42:40.584
before his psychological wounds
are fully healed.

42:40.658 --> 42:42.353
My guess is the Vori used

42:42.426 --> 42:44.519
a combination
of mind control techniques,

42:44.595 --> 42:47.428
including
photometric projections,

42:47.498 --> 42:48.965
heightened emotional stimuli

42:49.033 --> 42:51.866
and highly sophisticated
psychotropic manipulation.

42:51.936 --> 42:54.131
From the condition
of your hypothalamus,

42:54.204 --> 42:55.796
l'd say they had you
so mixed up

42:55.873 --> 42:58.364
they could have convinced you
your own mother was a turnip.

43:00.010 --> 43:02.808
Everything l experienced
was some sort of simulation?

43:02.913 --> 43:04.540
Except for the battle
you were fighting

43:04.582 --> 43:05.514
when Tuvok found you.

43:05.583 --> 43:09.019
Apparently, attacking
the simulated commandant

43:09.086 --> 43:11.850
marked your graduation
from basic training.

43:11.922 --> 43:13.685
And the men l fought beside--

43:13.757 --> 43:15.281
none of them was real?

43:15.359 --> 43:17.623
Namon and Rafin weren't killed
in front of me?

43:17.695 --> 43:20.255
As far as we can tell, they
were part of the simulation.

43:20.331 --> 43:21.628
The idea was to make you bond

43:21.699 --> 43:24.429
with your fellow soldiers
as well as the villagers,

43:24.501 --> 43:26.469
so their deaths
would enrage you.

43:29.707 --> 43:31.402
Why me?

43:31.475 --> 43:33.409
Luck of the draw.

43:33.477 --> 43:35.308
You happened to be
passing through their space

43:35.379 --> 43:37.438
and you were as promising
a recruit as anyone else.

43:37.514 --> 43:39.243
We've been told
the Vori have dozens

43:39.316 --> 43:40.647
of these training facilities

43:40.718 --> 43:42.982
where they conscript
their own people

43:43.053 --> 43:44.987
and any aliens
they're able to capture.

43:45.055 --> 43:47.523
ln short, Commander,
you've been subjected

43:47.591 --> 43:50.219
to a highly sophisticated form
of propaganda.

43:51.462 --> 43:53.987
Then the Kradin don't kill
innocent civilians?

43:54.064 --> 43:56.396
They don't desecrate
the Vori's dead?

43:56.467 --> 43:58.799
l don't know.

43:58.869 --> 44:02.600
But the Kradin accuse the Vori
of the same kinds of atrocities.

44:02.706 --> 44:06.437
l cared about the Vori,
but l hated the Kradin.

44:06.477 --> 44:08.411
l wanted to kill
every one of them.

44:08.479 --> 44:10.674
Evidently, that was the point.

44:11.749 --> 44:12.716
Captain.

44:12.783 --> 44:13.909
Ambassador Treen would like

44:13.984 --> 44:15.576
to have a word
with the Commander.

44:15.653 --> 44:18.554
l wish to tell you how pleased

44:18.622 --> 44:21.489
our people are
to hear of your recovery.

44:21.558 --> 44:23.219
l'm only sorry we weren't able

44:23.293 --> 44:25.420
to rescue you sooner
