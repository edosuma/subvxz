<i>Previously on</i> Fringe...

00:01.876 --> 00:03.222
A series of events
has occured.

00:03.253 --> 00:04.912
These events appear to be
scientific in nature.

00:04.979 --> 00:06.447
It's being referred to
as the Pattern.

00:06.514 --> 00:07.983
OLIVIA:
<i>He worked out of Harvard.</i>

00:08.018 --> 00:09.985
<i>In an area called</i>
<i>Fringe Science.</i>

00:10.020 --> 00:12.505
PETER: You're telling me my father
was Dr. Frankenstein.

00:13.061 --> 00:14.245
You were in an accident.

00:14.305 --> 00:17.048
You were missing from your car
for at least an hour

00:17.083 --> 00:19.083
before you came crashing back
through the windshield.

00:19.151 --> 00:21.076
What if there's
a part of my brain

00:21.111 --> 00:22.512
that's trying
to protect me?

00:22.547 --> 00:23.424
What's this?

00:23.425 --> 00:24.198
NINA: <i>Sam Weiss.</i>

00:24.278 --> 00:25.957
The man who helped
put me back together.

00:26.225 --> 00:27.985
Have the headaches
started yet?

00:28.020 --> 00:29.473
- No.
- They will.

Hey. None of
that vanilla hazelnut crap.

00:43.372 --> 00:45.086
Normal coffee, all right?

00:45.429 --> 00:46.895
I already called it in.

00:53.221 --> 00:55.597
[phone ringing]

00:59.260 --> 00:59.760
Yes, Colonel?

00:59.827 --> 01:01.050
<i>It's time.</i>

01:01.095 --> 01:02.396
<i>Get to Suburban Station.</i>

01:02.696 --> 01:04.327
<i>He'll be wearing</i>
<i>a black trench coat</i>

01:04.361 --> 01:05.782
<i>carrying</i>
<i>a black briefcase.</i>

01:11.273 --> 01:15.024
[tires squealing]
[siren wailing]

01:22.958 --> 01:24.148
<i>Where are you, Gillespie?</i>

01:24.513 --> 01:26.278
<i>Gillespie, seriously,</i>
<i>for the last time,</i>

01:26.313 --> 01:27.163
<i>where are--</i>

01:43.168 --> 01:45.145
[woman over P.A. talking]

02:06.855 --> 02:08.860
Set the briefcase
down now.

02:08.895 --> 02:10.122
What's this about?

02:11.125 --> 02:12.168
What did I do?

02:14.094 --> 02:16.607
You give me
the briefcase now.

02:16.642 --> 02:17.296
[static sound]

02:17.497 --> 02:18.289
What's
the problem here?

02:18.339 --> 02:19.431
I got it
under control.

02:19.499 --> 02:20.466
Give me the case.

02:21.005 --> 02:22.923
Hey, stop!
You can't do that!

02:23.737 --> 02:25.000
You can't take that!

02:26.406 --> 02:28.504
<i>What--</i>
<i>What's wrong?</i>

02:29.943 --> 02:31.661
<i>Officer,</i>
<i>what's the matter?</i>

02:33.179 --> 02:34.312
[static sound]

02:34.380 --> 02:36.619
Aah!

02:51.464 --> 02:55.271
"Fracture"

03:04.814 --> 03:06.388
[pins clatter]

03:09.049 --> 03:10.716
The rabbit
goes around the tree

03:10.784 --> 03:11.751
then through the hole.

03:11.818 --> 03:13.519
Yeah, I know
how to tie my shoes.

03:13.587 --> 03:15.088
Knowing how
isn't the issue.

03:15.155 --> 03:17.336
You suffered some
wicked head trauma.

03:17.558 --> 03:18.734
<i>Don't think</i>
<i>about your hands,</i>

03:18.774 --> 03:20.356
<i>don't think</i>
<i>about the laces.</i>

03:20.427 --> 03:23.396
<i>Your shoes will</i>
<i>get tied just fine.</i>

03:23.463 --> 03:24.964
Yeah, just by magic.

03:25.395 --> 03:25.927
No.

03:26.567 --> 03:27.990
But that
would be pretty cool.

03:29.384 --> 03:31.893
You know, what exactly
did you do for Nina Sharp?

03:35.742 --> 03:37.209
I taught her
how to eat French fries.

03:37.277 --> 03:40.082
You know, pick one up,
dip it in the ketchup,

03:40.117 --> 03:41.647
stick it in
your mouth, repeat.

03:41.714 --> 03:46.053
Simple enough, unless you've
got a cybernetic prosthetic arm.

03:46.491 --> 03:47.613
<i>Nina was a mess.</i>

03:48.696 --> 03:52.124
See, I prefer
the bunny ears method

03:52.192 --> 03:53.768
to the one loop wrap.

03:54.628 --> 03:57.231
But it does require
more coordination.

03:57.856 --> 03:58.931
You'll get there.

03:58.999 --> 04:00.034
Don't take
this the wrong way,

04:00.069 --> 04:01.701
but I can't
waste my time.

04:01.769 --> 04:03.035
Are you sleeping
at night?

04:04.872 --> 04:07.595
You've got circles around
your eyes, pale skin...

04:09.210 --> 04:11.095
You don't get more
than two or three hours

04:11.130 --> 04:12.245
at a stretch, do you?

04:15.784 --> 04:17.451
Lingering pain
from the accident?

04:20.154 --> 04:21.789
In my leg
and my shoulder.

04:22.489 --> 04:24.864
And you say the headaches
haven't started yet?

04:26.044 --> 04:26.953
No.

04:27.539 --> 04:29.206
Well, let me know
when they do.

04:30.666 --> 04:32.659
You can take the shoes
off now, we're done.

04:33.291 --> 04:34.212
That's it?

04:34.247 --> 04:36.536
Yeah, unless you want me
to mop up the men's room.

04:36.571 --> 04:37.611
I'm closing now.

04:41.810 --> 04:43.131
<i>Come back tomorrow,</i>
<i>Agent Dunham.</i>

04:43.173 --> 04:44.469
<i>We've got work to do.</i>

04:48.350 --> 04:50.621
[bells tolling]

04:52.521 --> 04:53.671
All right,
how about this one?

04:53.989 --> 04:56.024
"Two bedroom, two bath
loft in Oak Square.

04:56.092 --> 04:57.659
"Cook's kitchen,
hardwood floors,

04:57.727 --> 04:59.154
and a breakfast nook."

04:59.228 --> 05:00.591
Does it face the east?

05:00.896 --> 05:02.552
Uh... no.

05:02.592 --> 05:03.983
Riverview,
so it faces north.

05:04.032 --> 05:05.276
Then it won't do.

05:05.667 --> 05:07.203
I need the morning sun.

05:09.637 --> 05:10.936
Fine, how about this?

05:11.005 --> 05:13.374
"Three bedroom duplex
in Allston, facing east."

05:13.409 --> 05:16.143
All the morning sun
a waking scientist could want.

05:16.210 --> 05:17.962
I never liked Allston.

05:18.012 --> 05:20.061
Arlington either,
for that matter.

05:20.114 --> 05:23.050
I'm perfectly happy
with our present accommodations.

05:23.117 --> 05:24.284
Well, I'm not, Walter.

05:24.352 --> 05:25.619
I need
my own bedroom.

05:25.687 --> 05:26.984
I woke up this morning

05:27.019 --> 05:29.446
to him singing
an aria from <i>Pagliacci.</i>

05:29.724 --> 05:31.953
Your father
has a wonderful voice.

05:31.959 --> 05:33.626
Not when
he's doing jumping jacks.

05:33.694 --> 05:34.961
And did I mention
he was naked?

05:35.029 --> 05:37.801
A good morning
sets the tone for the day.

05:38.632 --> 05:40.082
<i>Come take</i>
<i>a look at this.</i>

05:40.083 --> 05:42.930
<i>I've been running a filter</i>
<i>for atypical FBI case reports.</i>

05:42.965 --> 05:43.783
<i>I just got a hit.</i>

05:43.818 --> 05:46.317
Some sort of bomb
went off in Philadelphia.

05:46.407 --> 05:47.875
[typing]

05:47.910 --> 05:49.309
Single explosive device.

05:49.377 --> 05:51.047
<i>11 dead, 28 wounded.</i>

05:51.979 --> 05:54.026
This last part
is what caught my eye.

05:54.061 --> 05:56.416
<i>They can't find any</i>
<i>explosive residue at the scene.</i>

05:57.594 --> 05:59.352
How's a bomb
go off without leaving

05:59.420 --> 06:00.793
any trace of it afterwards?

06:00.828 --> 06:02.578
Shall I get
my coat, Peter?

06:04.591 --> 06:05.857
I'll call Dunham.

06:07.110 --> 06:10.807
[whispering] Agent Farnsworth,
get my portable chemistry set.

06:11.015 --> 06:13.699
<i>This means bodies.</i>
[chuckles]

06:13.767 --> 06:15.536
TEVEZ: <i>The bomb guys don't</i>
<i>know what to make of it.</i>

06:15.571 --> 06:17.408
<i>They say, given</i>
<i>the nature of the wounds,</i>

06:17.443 --> 06:18.938
<i>you'd expect</i>
<i>an explosive device</i>

06:19.005 --> 06:20.706
<i>filled with nails</i>
<i>or steel ball bearings.</i>

06:20.774 --> 06:21.728
But it wasn't.

06:21.808 --> 06:22.918
No. In fact...

06:23.276 --> 06:24.777
there's no
forensic markers at all.

06:24.844 --> 06:26.346
OLIVIA:
<i>So what about eye witnesses?</i>

06:26.381 --> 06:27.902
TEVEZ: <i>Oh, I've got half a dozen</i>
<i>eye witnesses,</i>

06:27.942 --> 06:29.781
<i>but nobody who saw</i>
<i>anything helpful.</i>

06:29.849 --> 06:31.517
PETER:
<i>huh, it's weird.</i>

06:31.584 --> 06:35.172
This place has major
anti-terrorism security.

06:35.222 --> 06:37.323
<i>EMP disabling devices</i>
<i>at every entrance,</i>

06:37.391 --> 06:38.858
<i>explosive materials</i>
<i>sensors...</i>

06:38.926 --> 06:41.361
We checked, and not
a single sensor is tripped.

06:42.241 --> 06:44.430
So what did
the surveillance cameras show?

06:44.498 --> 06:46.866
Nothing, nothing
but magnetic static.

06:46.934 --> 06:47.752
It seems that whatever

06:47.782 --> 06:49.702
happened in here
wiped the images.

06:50.789 --> 06:52.457
Would you mind
if we see those tapes?

06:52.492 --> 06:53.580
I'll see
what I can do.

06:54.741 --> 06:56.141
Let me guess,
you got a friend?

06:56.209 --> 06:57.910
[chuckles]
Maybe I do.

06:57.978 --> 06:59.378
FEMALE AGENT:
<i>Excuse me, sir?</i>

06:59.446 --> 07:00.750
<i>Do you have a badge?</i>

07:00.914 --> 07:03.015
WALTER: <i>No, I don't</i>
<i>have a badge. Do you?</i>

07:03.485 --> 07:04.149
I got it.

07:04.916 --> 07:05.770
Walter...

07:06.532 --> 07:07.162
What's going on?

07:07.254 --> 07:10.316
This rather
unpleasant young woman

07:10.351 --> 07:11.689
is interfering
with my work.

07:11.724 --> 07:12.424
Is he with you?

07:12.492 --> 07:14.460
Yeah, but don't
hold that against me.

07:14.694 --> 07:15.725
We're FBI.

07:16.129 --> 07:17.162
Go ahead.

07:17.230 --> 07:19.604
So? What is it?

07:19.639 --> 07:21.726
Shrapnel, I believe,
from the bomb.

07:22.369 --> 07:24.566
Some sort of crystal.

07:24.905 --> 07:26.806
[tapping]

07:26.873 --> 07:28.447
Hard as a diamond.

07:32.209 --> 07:33.223
Salty.

07:33.258 --> 07:34.391
Silica, I guess.

07:34.426 --> 07:36.916
Well, I'll need to examine
the rest of the bodies, if--

07:38.419 --> 07:40.348
If that's all right
with you, miss.

07:42.289 --> 07:43.273
<i>Thank you.</i>

07:47.795 --> 07:49.350
[sighs]

08:11.785 --> 08:12.829
BROYLES:
<i>Agent Dunham...</i>

08:15.856 --> 08:17.914
I spoke with our
counter-terrorism analysts.

08:17.949 --> 08:18.718
Mm-hmm?

08:18.759 --> 08:20.860
No one stepped forward
to claim responsibility.

08:20.895 --> 08:22.263
And there's been
no increase in chatter

08:22.292 --> 08:23.551
- from our usual suspects.
- Hey, guys,

08:23.633 --> 08:25.181
I found this
wedged in a bench.

08:25.254 --> 08:27.949
It's a badge--Philly P.D.,
Officer Gillespie.

08:28.234 --> 08:29.768
Were there any police
among the wounded

08:29.836 --> 08:31.279
- taken to the hospital?
- Mm-mm.

08:31.604 --> 08:32.724
So, where'd he go?

08:33.039 --> 08:33.746
<i>Peter!</i>

08:35.542 --> 08:36.467
I was wrong.

08:37.534 --> 08:38.772
The crystal...

08:39.246 --> 08:42.214
I think it's not geologic
in origin,

08:42.282 --> 08:42.956
after all.

08:43.383 --> 08:45.411
In fact, I'm certain
it's organic.

08:45.886 --> 08:48.401
OLIVIA:
<i>Is that an ear?</i>

08:48.848 --> 08:49.619
Well...

08:49.654 --> 08:50.823
<i>I think Walter might</i>
<i>have just</i>

08:50.842 --> 08:52.326
<i>found Officer Gillespie.</i>

08:59.653 --> 09:03.265
This looks like
fungiform papillae.

09:04.797 --> 09:06.121
Taste buds.

09:06.695 --> 09:08.480
- Tongue.
- Mm-hmm.

09:09.932 --> 09:13.268
Walter, as much as I am
enjoying this anatomy lesson,

09:13.755 --> 09:16.009
what exactly
are we doing here?

09:16.173 --> 09:17.745
Well, that's obvious,
my dear.

09:18.357 --> 09:20.023
We're searching for clues.

09:20.966 --> 09:23.337
Scientific evidence
to reveal

09:23.615 --> 09:26.317
what type of device
this man was wearing

09:26.384 --> 09:29.950
which caused him
to harden, then shatter.

09:33.594 --> 09:35.830
<i>I understand Peter's</i>
<i>looking for a new place</i>

09:35.865 --> 09:36.729
<i>for you guys to live.</i>

09:42.103 --> 09:43.871
It occurs to me,
Agent Farnsworth,

09:43.939 --> 09:46.172
that I've never
asked you where you live.

09:46.499 --> 09:48.197
- Where I live?
- Yeah.

09:48.588 --> 09:49.306
Diaphragm.

09:49.979 --> 09:53.482
Well... most of
the time I live here.

09:53.850 --> 09:55.985
But my apartment
is in Sommerville.

09:57.047 --> 09:58.934
You should go
for a walk sometime...

09:59.190 --> 10:01.094
explore the neighborhood.

10:01.129 --> 10:03.460
<i>The other day, I...</i>

10:03.528 --> 10:05.064
turned the wrong way
in the street,

10:05.230 --> 10:07.754
and discovered that
Busby's...

10:08.234 --> 10:11.053
has the world's best
apple fritters.

10:11.088 --> 10:14.530
<i>You see, I have everything</i>
<i>I need where we live now.</i>

10:15.442 --> 10:16.993
I know what you mean,
Walter.

10:17.745 --> 10:19.681
I'm a creature
of habit, too.

10:20.181 --> 10:24.170
Of course, you never would've
found Busby's apple fritters

10:24.205 --> 10:26.198
if you hadn't gone
the wrong way down a street.

10:28.291 --> 10:30.902
You really should try them,
they're quite delicious.

10:30.937 --> 10:32.067
[clink]
Brain.

10:34.164 --> 10:35.264
[beeps]

10:35.332 --> 10:36.599
SLIM JOE:
<i>Okay, that's it.</i>

10:36.667 --> 10:37.723
<i>That's the best I can do.</i>

10:38.069 --> 10:41.197
Well, that
must be Gillespie.

10:41.440 --> 10:43.525
<i>But I don't see a bomb.</i>

10:44.679 --> 10:45.804
Then it cuts out.

10:46.403 --> 10:47.379
[high-pitched rewinding noise]

10:47.729 --> 10:49.581
You know, I told her
you were a genius, Joe.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.450
- Don't prove me wrong.
- [chuckles]

10:51.518 --> 10:53.416
<i>Then you're gonna</i>
<i>need a smarter genius.</i>

10:53.754 --> 10:55.095
Do you have any idea how

10:55.130 --> 10:56.589
something like this
could happen?

10:56.590 --> 10:58.458
The static? No.

10:58.526 --> 11:00.825
Maybe radio wave interference.

11:00.929 --> 11:03.430
Certain high frequencies
can tweak electronic signals.

11:03.498 --> 11:04.832
<i>Look at the time code.</i>

11:05.593 --> 11:07.867
That's about 20 seconds
before the bomb went off.

11:07.902 --> 11:11.639
OLIVIA: <i>So why do we lose</i>
<i>picture before the explosion?</i>

11:15.177 --> 11:16.277
How's it going, Walter?

11:16.345 --> 11:17.680
Any theories?

11:17.779 --> 11:18.753
Several.

11:19.448 --> 11:22.743
Peter, do you remember
that jigsaw puzzle

11:22.778 --> 11:24.318
we put together
when you were a kid?

11:24.920 --> 11:27.190
Uh... the jigsaw?
No.

11:27.356 --> 11:32.487
As I recall, her name
was Melissa... something.

11:32.528 --> 11:34.504
- 500 pieces.
- [laughing] Yes.

11:35.717 --> 11:37.147
Yes, I do remember.

11:37.182 --> 11:38.681
Melissa was a playmate.

11:38.716 --> 11:40.028
<i>Miss July, right?</i>

11:40.063 --> 11:40.999
<i>Putting together a jigsaw</i>

11:41.034 --> 11:42.719
of a nude centerfold
was Walter's idea of

11:42.754 --> 11:44.339
how to explain--
What was it?

11:44.407 --> 11:46.708
Human reproduction
to his ten-year-old son.

11:46.776 --> 11:49.955
So what does any of
that have to do

11:49.990 --> 11:51.473
with the bomb
in Philadelphia?

11:51.481 --> 11:53.104
Patience, son.

11:55.251 --> 11:56.009
Voilà.

11:56.519 --> 11:58.216
Meet Officer Gillespie.

11:59.121 --> 12:00.916
Fantastic.

12:02.492 --> 12:04.662
So apart from the obvious,

12:04.697 --> 12:06.298
anything out
of the ordinary?

12:06.333 --> 12:08.645
Needle marks
between the toes.

12:09.488 --> 12:13.458
It was some form of
transformative serum,

12:13.493 --> 12:14.279
I would think.

12:14.437 --> 12:15.846
I can't say what yet.

12:15.871 --> 12:18.241
<i>From his tissues,</i>
<i>it appears to cause</i>

12:18.276 --> 12:20.648
<i>a chemical reaction</i>
<i>on the cellular level</i>

12:20.683 --> 12:22.992
<i>that both solidifies</i>
<i>the water in his cells</i>

12:23.027 --> 12:27.068
and emitted massive energy,
which shattered the body.

12:27.103 --> 12:27.816
What are you saying,
Walter?

12:27.884 --> 12:29.284
You think
he did this to himself?

12:29.919 --> 12:30.770
On purpose?

12:30.820 --> 12:34.409
Well, I stopped counting
at 47 needle marks.

12:35.024 --> 12:37.350
I can't imagine
it was an accident.

12:37.713 --> 12:39.076
When you think
about it...

12:39.728 --> 12:42.497
wearing a bomb
is rather unimaginative.

12:42.564 --> 12:44.699
<i>This way, there's</i>
<i>no need to smuggle in</i>

12:44.767 --> 12:46.367
<i>an explosive device,</i>
<i>because--</i>

12:46.435 --> 12:48.354
Officer Gillespie
was the bomb.

12:48.389 --> 12:49.860
Fascinating, yes?

12:52.308 --> 12:54.211
MRS GILLESPIE: <i>We were planning</i>
<i>to start a family.</i>

12:54.343 --> 12:56.730
<i>I can't believe</i>
<i>he's not coming home.</i>

12:56.846 --> 12:58.729
<i>Dan always came home.</i>

12:59.248 --> 13:02.903
After every shift on the job,
two tours in Iraq,

13:03.535 --> 13:05.554
he always came home.

13:08.725 --> 13:10.686
No one would tell me
what happened.

13:11.895 --> 13:15.573
Just that it was...
some kind of bomb.

13:16.697 --> 13:18.296
We're still
investigating.

13:19.278 --> 13:20.662
I'm so sorry.

13:20.737 --> 13:22.621
PETER:
<i>Where was he stationed?</i>

13:22.839 --> 13:24.181
In Ramadi.

13:25.767 --> 13:26.669
Did you serve?

13:26.704 --> 13:29.044
No, a civilian contractor,
based out of Baghdad.

13:29.112 --> 13:30.078
But from what I remember,

13:30.146 --> 13:31.681
there was heavy
fighting in Ramadi.

13:31.948 --> 13:33.682
Was he
on any medication,

13:33.750 --> 13:36.527
or under any
sort of medical care?

13:36.562 --> 13:38.720
<i>No.</i>
<i>No, Dan was healthy.</i>

13:39.323 --> 13:40.790
<i>And I don't understand, </i>
<i>what does this</i>

13:40.825 --> 13:42.391
<i>have to do</i>
<i>with the explosion?</i>

13:42.459 --> 13:44.061
<i>You all right, Dunham?</i>

13:44.096 --> 13:46.688
Excuse me, do you have
a bathroom that I could use?

13:46.797 --> 13:47.953
Yeah,
it's down the hall.

13:51.280 --> 13:52.702
[heavy breathing]

13:57.608 --> 13:58.841
[indistinct voice]

14:04.614 --> 14:07.316
[retching, gagging]

14:17.227 --> 14:20.229
[toilet flushing]

15:04.341 --> 15:05.408
[knocking]

15:05.476 --> 15:06.832
PETER:
<i>Dunham, you all right?</i>

15:10.447 --> 15:14.078
Mrs. Gillespie, can you
tell me what these are?

15:15.654 --> 15:16.737
I don't know.

15:17.755 --> 15:19.467
I've never
seen them before.

15:22.058 --> 15:23.467
<i>Dan Gillespie doesn't fit</i>

15:23.502 --> 15:25.934
the profile
of a suicide bomber.

15:25.962 --> 15:27.563
Well, how do
you explain this stuff?

15:28.008 --> 15:29.444
'Cause I'm assuming
it's more than likely

15:29.479 --> 15:31.400
that this is exactly
what Walter was talking about.

15:31.469 --> 15:33.183
What turned him
into a bomb.

15:33.403 --> 15:35.473
Yeah, well, I can't yet.

15:35.872 --> 15:39.375
But I mean, what makes
someone blow themselves up?

15:39.442 --> 15:41.944
Typically, they're
either waging a war,

15:42.011 --> 15:44.225
or making a statement.

15:44.266 --> 15:46.929
Dan Gillespie was
a decorated cop and soldier,

15:46.957 --> 15:49.610
just getting
himself back together.

15:50.729 --> 15:51.730
It doesn't make sense.

15:52.089 --> 15:53.676
Is there anything else
on your mind?

15:54.491 --> 15:55.573
Like what?

15:56.993 --> 15:57.994
The headache.

15:58.896 --> 16:00.511
Didn't the doctor
say that would happen?

16:01.799 --> 16:04.525
Uh, they said they might.

16:04.560 --> 16:06.702
That it was totally normal.

16:07.004 --> 16:08.858
We should get that
back to Walter.

16:09.215 --> 16:11.278
<i>Maybe he can figure out</i>
<i>where those vials came from.</i>

16:11.509 --> 16:12.744
[door closes]

17:25.484 --> 17:27.554
[sirens blaring]

17:33.703 --> 17:35.007
- [inhales]
- Let me help you with that.

17:35.731 --> 17:36.608
Colonel.

17:36.966 --> 17:39.788
We need to talk,
Captain Burgess.

17:41.744 --> 17:43.869
<i>I'm calling you</i>
<i>back to active status.</i>

17:43.973 --> 17:45.644
You're going to D.C.
on Friday.

17:45.676 --> 17:49.178
Hotel reservations, plane tickets,
all--self-explanatory.

17:49.245 --> 17:52.865
<i>Now that phone, keep it</i>
<i>with you at all times.</i>

17:53.150 --> 17:54.363
<i>Check in</i>
<i>with the hotel,</i>

17:54.398 --> 17:56.852
<i>wait for me to call you</i>
<i>with further instructions.</i>

17:56.920 --> 17:59.957
Do you have a cover story
prepared for your family?

17:59.992 --> 18:00.860
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

18:01.123 --> 18:02.495
<i>I'll say</i>
<i>I'm visiting my sister.</i>

18:02.526 --> 18:03.782
<i>She lives in Georgetown.</i>

18:05.178 --> 18:06.915
<i>Have you been</i>
<i>taking the serum?</i>

18:08.252 --> 18:09.534
Yes, sir.

18:09.569 --> 18:10.669
<i>Good, because</i>

18:10.704 --> 18:11.474
from this moment on,

18:11.494 --> 18:14.075
Tin Man parameters
are in effect.

18:16.274 --> 18:17.786
[car door opening]

18:18.944 --> 18:20.434
[car door closing]

18:27.208 --> 18:28.815
[pins clatter]

18:30.256 --> 18:32.085
So... how'd you know?

18:33.770 --> 18:35.902
- The headaches started.
- Mm-hmm.

18:36.129 --> 18:37.333
Well, it's about time.

18:37.368 --> 18:38.899
Can you just
cut the Yoda crap

18:38.934 --> 18:40.498
and tell me
what's happening to me?

18:43.899 --> 18:45.165
The short version...

18:45.668 --> 18:49.379
The headaches mean you've
finally sparked the battery.

18:49.572 --> 18:51.002
You've been experiencing...

18:51.037 --> 18:52.274
[sighs]

18:52.342 --> 18:55.091
an acute nominal aphasia,
Agent Dunham.

18:55.126 --> 18:57.225
It's common
with head trauma.

18:57.380 --> 18:59.382
Parts of your brain
are still asleep.

18:59.449 --> 19:02.452
But once they wake up, all that
memory will get flushed out.

19:02.519 --> 19:04.349
- When?
- When?

19:04.455 --> 19:06.322
When will I get
my memory back?

19:12.930 --> 19:14.216
You know,
everywhere you go

19:14.966 --> 19:16.733
the scoring apparatuses
have changed.

19:16.801 --> 19:18.126
Computers, no fun.

19:18.161 --> 19:19.803
Here, we do things
old school,

19:19.871 --> 19:22.959
with a dull pencil and all
your third grade math skills.

19:22.994 --> 19:24.138
You know,
this is ridiculous.

19:24.173 --> 19:26.644
I'm not bowling, I can't even
walk without this damn cane.

19:27.144 --> 19:28.146
You're not bowling.

19:28.214 --> 19:30.095
I've got a kid's league
coming in here,

19:30.130 --> 19:31.283
you're gonna keep score.

19:31.350 --> 19:33.118
How is that
gonna help my memory?

19:33.186 --> 19:35.187
I mean, how is
that gonna help me at all?

19:35.255 --> 19:36.889
Well, for starters,

19:37.637 --> 19:39.914
it might teach you
some patience.

19:44.432 --> 19:46.466
WALTER:
Ah, is that food I smell?

19:46.869 --> 19:48.201
Bless you!

19:48.269 --> 19:51.234
Mm-hmm, mm.
Mm-hmm.

19:52.206 --> 19:54.416
While examining
Officer Gillespie,

19:54.451 --> 19:55.999
I've discovered
something else.

19:56.034 --> 19:59.170
Given the amount of serum
that we found in his tissue,

19:59.247 --> 20:01.349
and the rate at which
it would've metabolized,

20:01.416 --> 20:03.818
I suspect that he
would've had to inject it

20:03.886 --> 20:05.552
every day
for a very long time.

20:05.587 --> 20:06.614
Well, how long?

20:06.622 --> 20:08.317
At least a year,
I would think.

20:09.201 --> 20:10.339
A year?

20:10.960 --> 20:13.505
That would mean Gillespie
started injecting

20:13.540 --> 20:15.114
while he was still
on his tour in Iraq.

20:15.264 --> 20:17.066
<i>Did his army personnel file</i>
<i>come through yet?</i>

20:17.133 --> 20:18.849
I haven't seen it.
Let me check though.

20:18.969 --> 20:21.480
Oh, yeah.
Interestingly...

20:22.206 --> 20:25.208
When the serum is
first introduced or injected,

20:25.276 --> 20:26.874
it's fairly harmless.

20:26.911 --> 20:28.779
But then
something else occurs,

20:28.847 --> 20:30.530
a secondary reaction.

20:30.782 --> 20:36.755
Some sort of trigger causes
these bombs to blast apart.

20:36.823 --> 20:38.709
[cow mooing]

20:39.058 --> 20:40.070
The triggers--

20:40.626 --> 20:41.762
Peter...

20:41.860 --> 20:44.562
If you are going to eat
that cheeseburger in here,

20:44.630 --> 20:46.431
could you at least
be a little discreet?

20:51.737 --> 20:53.179
[cow mooing]

20:59.120 --> 20:59.784
Fine.

21:00.312 --> 21:03.236
This trigger, could it
be a radio wave?

21:04.771 --> 21:05.683
There was some
sort of interference

21:05.751 --> 21:07.452
on the security tapes
inside the train station.

21:07.519 --> 21:09.779
Most likely
caused by radio waves.

21:10.901 --> 21:13.370
Yes.
I suppose so.

21:13.626 --> 21:16.470
Peter, I've got
Gillespie's military file.

21:16.505 --> 21:17.797
<i>What's</i>
<i>'cyanogen chloride'?</i>

21:17.864 --> 21:19.406
It's a chemical weapon.

21:23.605 --> 21:25.707
<i>His whole unit was</i>
<i>exposed to cyanogen.</i>

21:26.657 --> 21:27.492
According to this file,

21:27.527 --> 21:28.843
Gillespie should've
died in Iraq.

21:28.911 --> 21:30.212
[typing]

21:31.227 --> 21:33.648
PETER: Four words that should
never show up in a sentence.

21:33.716 --> 21:36.718
"Classified experimental
military project."

21:36.786 --> 21:39.354
How much you wanna bet that
Tin Man has everything to do

21:39.422 --> 21:41.490
with those injections
that Gillespie was taking?

21:41.558 --> 21:43.826
It says here that Project
Tin Man was shut down.

21:43.894 --> 21:46.437
Shortly after Dan Gillespie
returned home.

21:46.830 --> 21:49.061
And all the names of
the U.S. military personnel

21:49.096 --> 21:51.267
associated with the project
were redacted from the record.

21:51.614 --> 21:54.337
But it still lists
Malik Yusef, Abbas Khalef,

21:54.405 --> 21:56.173
and Howard Ziad
as Iraqi doctors

21:56.240 --> 21:57.762
who worked
on the program.

21:57.809 --> 21:59.142
Where are they?

21:59.210 --> 22:00.797
Presumably
still in the country.

22:00.879 --> 22:02.613
CENTCOM has agreed
to look for them,

22:02.681 --> 22:04.749
but it may take a few weeks
to track anything down.

22:05.506 --> 22:06.910
I may be able to help.

22:08.155 --> 22:10.049
But I'm gonna
need a few things first.

22:10.841 --> 22:11.587
[sigh]

22:11.723 --> 22:13.241
I need
to go back to Iraq.

22:14.259 --> 22:16.527
I know somebody who can
help us find those doctors.

22:16.562 --> 22:19.068
Seems a long way
to go for a maybe.

22:19.103 --> 22:20.472
Well, we have
to assume that Gillespie

22:20.507 --> 22:21.967
was not a solitary event.

22:23.068 --> 22:24.869
There may be others
out there like him,

22:24.937 --> 22:27.386
walking bombs.
We don't have two weeks to wait.

22:27.421 --> 22:28.678
What is it you need?

22:28.713 --> 22:31.583
Private air transportation,
$20,000 in cash,

22:31.618 --> 22:33.561
and a passport without
my real name on it.

22:34.041 --> 22:34.605
Oh?

22:35.016 --> 22:36.847
I'm still on
a couple of watch lists.

22:36.882 --> 22:38.217
Then you're gonna
need a federal agent

22:38.285 --> 22:39.304
with you as well.

22:44.758 --> 22:46.608
I'm reluctant
to send you, Agent Dunham.

22:47.127 --> 22:50.663
With that said, we need
to keep this trip between us.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.706
You look
after each other.

22:59.943 --> 23:01.119
You ready for this?

23:05.113 --> 23:06.937
<i>Baghdad, here we come.</i>

23:26.512 --> 23:28.066
[indistinct conversations]

23:28.805 --> 23:30.412
Maybe I should wait
outside.

23:31.299 --> 23:32.644
Then what would I do?

23:33.898 --> 23:35.073
You're the one
with the gun.

23:55.898 --> 23:57.165
[speaking Arabic]

23:57.233 --> 23:58.493
<i>Assalam waleikum.</i>
(Good morning)

24:25.561 --> 24:27.511
In that case,
we speak English.

24:32.335 --> 24:33.822
[clears throat]

24:38.341 --> 24:39.711
I need your help,
Ahmed.

24:40.209 --> 24:42.699
A U.S. military program
named Tin Man.

24:42.779 --> 24:45.123
It's operating out of
a hospital in Samarra.

24:46.359 --> 24:48.056
I need to find
one of the Iraqi doctors

24:48.091 --> 24:49.693
who was working in
that program.

24:50.286 --> 24:52.917
I can pay you, of course.

24:52.952 --> 24:54.977
When I heard
you had been killed,

24:55.525 --> 24:57.347
I knew this could
not be true.

24:57.827 --> 25:00.539
Because a person like you
is good at one thing.

25:01.831 --> 25:05.307
More than anything else,
a person like you

25:05.435 --> 25:07.269
is good at looking out
for yourself.

25:10.273 --> 25:11.901
Now you are here...

25:13.042 --> 25:14.571
asking for my help?

25:17.212 --> 25:18.254
Yes, I am.

25:18.413 --> 25:20.594
Maybe someone else
will want your money.

25:21.449 --> 25:22.881
I don't.

25:23.384 --> 25:24.334
Ahmed...

25:26.254 --> 25:28.722
A lot of innocent lives
may be on the line.

25:32.060 --> 25:33.102
I see.

25:33.594 --> 25:36.470
And this is something
you care about now?

25:37.062 --> 25:38.265
Yes, I do.

25:41.035 --> 25:42.691
I may be able
to save them...

25:43.504 --> 25:44.648
with your help.

25:56.119 --> 25:58.027
What are the names
of these doctors?

26:12.737 --> 26:14.183
Have some tea.

26:14.973 --> 26:16.677
I will see what I can do.

26:25.485 --> 26:27.247
You gonna tell me
what that was about?

26:29.456 --> 26:30.210
No.

26:35.263 --> 26:36.303
Doctor Bishop,

26:36.731 --> 26:39.337
what did I tell you
about experimenting with fruit?

26:39.401 --> 26:41.694
I just cleaned
this lab up yesterday.

26:41.770 --> 26:43.229
Relax, my dear.

26:43.873 --> 26:46.007
Just injecting
a very small amount

26:46.075 --> 26:47.737
of the serum
into the watermelon.

26:48.478 --> 26:49.872
Just to crystallize it.

26:50.847 --> 26:53.115
The serum we found
at Gillespie's house

26:53.183 --> 26:55.118
told us how
he became a bomb.

26:55.185 --> 26:57.810
But the question remains,

26:58.556 --> 27:00.139
what triggered it?

27:00.692 --> 27:03.661
So you're using radio waves like
Peter suggested?

27:03.729 --> 27:04.617
Yes.

27:06.309 --> 27:10.277
Radio waves would also
explain the eyewitness reports

27:10.312 --> 27:12.440
of flashing lights
at the train station

27:12.475 --> 27:14.196
before the officer exploded.

27:15.076 --> 27:16.806
Quite ingenious, really.

27:17.445 --> 27:20.648
The same principal
applied to proximity fuses,

27:20.715 --> 27:23.584
and World War II
arial bombs...

27:23.652 --> 27:26.147
[static noises, rattling]

27:27.557 --> 27:31.765
In fact, my uncle Henry
was killed by one

27:31.800 --> 27:33.964
<i>in the battle</i>
<i>of the Guadalcanal.</i>

27:34.998 --> 27:36.200
<i>Oh, Astrid!</i>

27:36.235 --> 27:36.943
This is it!

27:37.868 --> 27:39.072
<i>Quickly,</i>
<i>what's the frequency?</i>

27:39.203 --> 27:41.230
331.6 megahertz.

27:41.265 --> 27:42.873
[static noises end]

27:43.241 --> 27:44.209
<i>What happened?</i>

27:44.620 --> 27:45.935
It stopped.

27:48.211 --> 27:49.247
I'm not sure.

27:54.855 --> 27:56.278
It works.

27:57.955 --> 27:59.859
No more fruit, Walter.

28:02.379 --> 28:04.288
Ready for something
a little harder than tea?

28:04.832 --> 28:06.085
Sure.

28:15.507 --> 28:16.547
Red Russian?

28:16.582 --> 28:18.180
<i>Yeah,</i>
<i>mint tea and vodka.</i>

28:18.248 --> 28:20.297
Well, it sounds
weird and awful.

28:26.157 --> 28:27.407
Actually, it's worse.

28:28.461 --> 28:29.582
You'll get used to it.

28:29.617 --> 28:30.895
How long were you here?

28:31.468 --> 28:32.512
Which time?

28:33.556 --> 28:35.182
I had to leave
a couple of times.

28:35.217 --> 28:37.578
Seems like you
made a name for yourself.

28:38.752 --> 28:40.946
I've been known
to leave an impression.

28:44.711 --> 28:45.673
To all that's weird.

29:05.401 --> 29:06.941
Doctor Malik Yusef...

29:08.605 --> 29:11.385
<i>Peter Bishop,</i>
<i>Olivia Dunham.</i>

29:12.042 --> 29:13.407
<i>Assalam waleikum.</i>
(Good morning)

29:13.767 --> 29:15.043
<i>Waleikum assalam.</i>
(Good morning)

29:37.972 --> 29:39.534
They consider me
a traitor.

29:39.841 --> 29:42.261
We were hoping
to ask you some questions

29:43.616 --> 29:45.668
about a program
that you worked on.

29:46.518 --> 29:48.080
A program called Tin Man?

29:50.185 --> 29:53.053
No, I do not know
anything about this.

29:53.121 --> 29:55.509
[dishes being washed]

30:05.334 --> 30:07.802
YUSEF: The program didn't work,
it was too dangerous.

30:07.870 --> 30:11.639
The soldiers had been exposed
to a synthetic neurotoxin,

30:11.707 --> 30:14.366
a nerve agent developed
under Saddam.

30:14.410 --> 30:16.623
- Cyanogen?
- Yes.

30:17.113 --> 30:19.715
We had been trying to find
a way to neutralize it

30:19.782 --> 30:21.383
to counteract the affects.

30:21.451 --> 30:23.351
And that's what
they called Tin Man?

30:23.419 --> 30:26.855
We had developed a...
a treatment.

30:26.923 --> 30:28.820
<i>Daily injections</i>
<i>of a serum.</i>

30:29.091 --> 30:31.423
We treated over 200 soldiers.

30:32.161 --> 30:33.528
Only a few of them survived.

30:34.156 --> 30:37.308
We know of one,
a Daniel Gillespie.

30:37.343 --> 30:39.301
Daniel, kind man.

30:39.368 --> 30:42.371
Um, over the course
of the program,

30:42.406 --> 30:43.572
<i>there were three others.</i>

30:43.640 --> 30:44.773
Do you remember
their names?

30:44.841 --> 30:47.042
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>I saved their lives.</i>

30:47.110 --> 30:52.047
<i>There was Joan Klump, Ross</i>
<i>Cavanaugh, and Diane Burgess.</i>

30:53.783 --> 30:55.619
MR BURGESS: <i>Okay, Diane,</i>
<i>you're all set.</i>

30:55.654 --> 30:57.232
Suitcase is
at the front door.

30:58.421 --> 31:00.200
Are you sure you don't want me
to drive you to the airport?

31:00.389 --> 31:02.124
YUSEF:
<i>But it was too dangerous.</i>

31:02.991 --> 31:06.080
The serum had
an unintentional byproduct.

31:06.596 --> 31:11.389
We had discovered that after it
built up in human tissue.

31:11.980 --> 31:14.537
It reacted in
a very unexpected way.

31:14.604 --> 31:16.416
It turned people into bombs.

31:16.451 --> 31:17.450
Yes.

31:18.475 --> 31:19.959
<i>How did you know that?</i>

31:22.011 --> 31:24.880
Doctor Yusef, how many
other people knew about this?

31:24.948 --> 31:28.317
Five doctors,
a dozen U.S. officers,

31:28.385 --> 31:31.454
and whoever they
reported to, I suppose.

31:31.489 --> 31:33.683
Someone is triggering
these people to explode.

31:33.718 --> 31:34.737
It could be anyone.

31:35.125 --> 31:37.706
There was a man,
a colonel.

31:38.061 --> 31:39.495
When the program
was shut down,

31:39.563 --> 31:41.263
he argued
it should be continued.

31:41.331 --> 31:42.698
Do you remember his name?

31:43.510 --> 31:47.432
Gordon.
Colonel Raymond Gordon.

31:48.350 --> 31:49.772
<i>Shukran, doctor.</i>
(Thank you, doctor)

31:51.174 --> 31:52.832
YUSEF:
<i>A word of warning...</i>

31:53.443 --> 31:55.419
<i>Gordon</i>
<i>is a vicious man.</i>

31:55.611 --> 31:57.848
<i>He has no regard</i>
<i>for human life.</i>

32:02.896 --> 32:04.220
You all have
briefing packets

32:04.255 --> 32:06.269
in front of you, so I'll just
point out the highlights.

32:06.387 --> 32:07.821
Information has
come to this agency

32:07.888 --> 32:10.394
that a bomb may be detonated
today somewhere in this city.

32:10.906 --> 32:13.184
But in this instance,
that bomb is a human being.

32:13.219 --> 32:15.588
<i>Three of the four known</i>
<i>operatives of Project Tin Man</i>

32:15.623 --> 32:16.473
<i>have been accounted for.</i>

32:16.512 --> 32:18.286
<i>Daniel Gillespie--</i>
<i>you're all familiar with.</i>

32:18.287 --> 32:20.342
Two others have been taken
into protective custody.

32:20.389 --> 32:22.056
Which leaves Diane Burgess.

32:22.124 --> 32:24.292
<i>We believe Captain Burgess</i>
<i>traveled to D.C.</i>

32:24.360 --> 32:25.526
<i>this morning,</i>
<i>under an alias.</i>

32:25.594 --> 32:26.885
<i>Though we do not</i>
<i>have any intelligence</i>

32:26.920 --> 32:28.231
<i>on her potential target.</i>

32:28.820 --> 32:30.764
A bolo has been issued
to all metro

32:30.832 --> 32:32.100
and state police
in the area.

32:32.135 --> 32:35.030
All potential high-value targets
are under close surveillance.

32:35.065 --> 32:36.570
Agent Dunham and I will
coordinate

32:36.638 --> 32:37.880
Captain Burgess' apprehension.

32:38.373 --> 32:40.875
- Agent Dunham?
- Based on our investigation,

32:40.943 --> 32:43.377
it's likely there
is a second suspect

32:43.445 --> 32:46.437
controlling detonation
from a remote location.

32:47.079 --> 32:49.784
We believe it's this man,
Colonel Raymond Gordon.

32:49.852 --> 32:53.229
<i>The Pentagon lost contact with</i>
<i>Colonel Gordon six months ago.</i>

32:53.289 --> 32:54.563
He's off the grid.

32:54.757 --> 32:57.792
Officially designated
a rogue operative.

32:57.860 --> 33:00.028
<i>Now based on</i>
<i>Dr. Bishop's analysis,</i>

33:00.095 --> 33:03.999
the explosion is triggered
by a specific VHF frequency.

33:04.034 --> 33:05.900
<i>Now if we can</i>
<i>locate Captain Burgess</i>

33:05.968 --> 33:07.368
<i>in time</i>
<i>to get within range,</i>

33:07.435 --> 33:10.437
we may be able to jam the signal
and prevent her detonation.

33:10.505 --> 33:13.408
<i>On that point, we suspect</i>
<i>that Diane Burgess</i>

33:13.443 --> 33:16.434
<i>is unaware she is being</i>
<i>used in a suicide bombing.</i>

33:16.469 --> 33:19.546
<i>Which means that she is</i>
<i>also a potential victim here.</i>

33:19.614 --> 33:21.515
We're gonna do
everything that we can

33:21.583 --> 33:24.212
to get her
back to her family alive.

33:24.386 --> 33:26.087
Diane Burgess
has just been located.

33:26.154 --> 33:27.916
<i>She's in a D.C. metro cab.</i>

33:27.951 --> 33:29.156
<i>Dispatchers say she's headed</i>

33:29.224 --> 33:30.867
to the Federal
Center Metro Station.

33:31.160 --> 33:33.196
We have time to set up
before she arrives.

33:33.231 --> 33:34.962
Our objectives are as follows:

33:35.030 --> 33:36.997
To prevent the detonation
of Captain Diane Burgess

33:37.065 --> 33:38.900
and to apprehend
Colonel Raymond Gordon.

33:41.770 --> 33:43.342
This is Broyles,
go ahead.

33:43.377 --> 33:46.074
<i>Video surveillance and 3-D</i>
<i>triangulation model online.</i>

33:46.141 --> 33:47.989
Stand by, we'll wait
for Diane Burgess.

33:56.986 --> 33:58.286
Snipers ready.

33:59.065 --> 33:59.621
Target sited,

33:59.689 --> 34:02.491
<i>arriving at Federal Center</i>
<i>Station, south portal.</i>

34:14.670 --> 34:15.838
<i>The phone's encrypted, sir.</i>

34:15.906 --> 34:17.108
<i>We can't tap into it.</i>

34:21.946 --> 34:23.713
<i>There's no sign of the colonel</i>
<i>outside of the station.</i>

34:23.781 --> 34:25.406
Copy that,
keep an eye on it.

34:26.387 --> 34:27.447
Where are we
on that signal?

34:27.483 --> 34:31.018
Attempting to acquire
signal 331.6 megahertz.

34:33.106 --> 34:35.525
Excuse me,
Agent Broyles...

34:36.025 --> 34:39.329
Is there an EMP detection
device in this station?

34:39.396 --> 34:40.830
All capitol
transportation hubs

34:40.898 --> 34:42.165
had them installed
after 9/11.

34:42.232 --> 34:44.103
- What's the problem?
- No problem.

34:45.005 --> 34:48.071
It's just that
the security device

34:48.139 --> 34:51.975
would scramble all types
of radio wave triggers.

34:52.043 --> 34:53.543
That sounds to me
like a good thing.

34:53.610 --> 34:55.013
<i>Frequency acquired.</i>

34:55.047 --> 34:56.699
Jamming. Ready.

34:56.715 --> 34:58.154
Prepare
to jam the signal.

34:59.151 --> 35:00.518
Stand by
to apprehend target.

35:00.586 --> 35:01.887
WALTER: <i>I'm thinking</i>
<i>that if the colonel</i>

35:01.922 --> 35:03.522
<i>wants Ms. Burgess</i>
<i>inside the building.</i>

35:03.589 --> 35:05.485
Then in order
to trigger the explosion,

35:05.625 --> 35:07.126
he must be inside as well.

35:07.194 --> 35:08.809
<i>Which means that</i>
<i>once he starts broadcasting,</i>

35:08.849 --> 35:10.863
we should be able
to triangulate his position.

35:10.931 --> 35:11.716
<i>But in order to do that,</i>

35:11.746 --> 35:13.642
<i>we would have to leave</i>
<i>the frequency open.</i>

35:13.968 --> 35:14.843
We can't jam it.

35:15.670 --> 35:17.137
This could
be our only chance

35:17.205 --> 35:19.045
to find Gordon
and apprehend him.

35:19.080 --> 35:21.108
TECH: <i>Target's about to enter</i>
<i>the station.</i>

35:24.313 --> 35:25.513
<i>Do we move, sir?</i>

35:27.583 --> 35:28.750
I said stand by.

35:28.819 --> 35:30.587
How long from when
he activates the signal

35:30.622 --> 35:31.732
until she detonates?

35:32.422 --> 35:34.010
30 seconds, at best.

35:34.045 --> 35:36.209
That should give us long enough
to be able to locate him.

35:36.861 --> 35:38.161
All units hold position.

35:38.228 --> 35:40.004
<i>Let the target</i>
<i>get into the building.</i>

35:41.899 --> 35:42.811
Go.

35:50.031 --> 35:52.521

<i>Accept the briefcase</i>

36:35.299 --> 36:36.827
The signal hasn't
been activated yet, sir.

36:47.007 --> 36:48.234
She's on the move.

36:48.269 --> 36:49.365
<i>Still no sign of Gordon.</i>

36:49.577 --> 36:50.878
[beeping]

36:50.945 --> 36:52.983
That--that's it.
That's the VHF signal.

36:53.018 --> 36:54.547
<i>She'll detonate</i>
<i>in 30 seconds.</i>

36:54.582 --> 36:55.750
Agent,
tell me where Gordon is.

36:55.818 --> 36:57.686
[beeping]
[static]

36:58.157 --> 36:59.041
Something's wrong.

36:59.189 --> 37:01.041
<i>Sir, the signal's</i>
<i>scrambling our equipment.</i>

37:01.076 --> 37:02.206
<i>I can't get a lock</i>
<i>on Gordon.</i>

37:02.241 --> 37:02.780
Smart.

37:02.811 --> 37:04.495
BROYLES: <i>The signal</i>
<i>is scrambling our equipment.</i>

37:05.439 --> 37:06.697
[static noises]

37:06.765 --> 37:08.699
I think you
have something for me.

37:08.767 --> 37:11.269
One Mississippi...
Two Mississippi...

37:11.337 --> 37:12.838
30 seconds.

37:12.905 --> 37:15.009
I don't know
what you're talking about.

37:15.308 --> 37:15.999
Okay, we've got her

37:16.042 --> 37:17.227
<i>speaking to a man</i>
<i>with a briefcase.</i>

37:17.277 --> 37:18.460
<i>It is not Gordon.</i>

37:18.646 --> 37:19.813
<i>Can you get</i>
<i>a lock on the signal?</i>

37:19.880 --> 37:20.818
TECH:
<i>We can't get a lock.</i>

37:20.853 --> 37:22.086
BROYLES:
<i>Then jam that signal.</i>

37:22.416 --> 37:23.802
[beeping]
<i>We're jamming the signal,</i>

37:23.837 --> 37:25.252
<i>I'm not risking these lives</i>
<i>to get Gordon.</i>

37:25.319 --> 37:26.954
- [beeping]
- Sir, it's--it's not working.

37:27.022 --> 37:28.732
<i>The signal's too strong</i>
<i>for our equipment.</i>

37:28.891 --> 37:29.434
<i>I'm locked out.</i>

37:30.245 --> 37:30.658
We have a problem.

37:30.726 --> 37:33.028
<i>Dunham, attempts to jam</i>
<i>the signal have failed.</i>

37:33.095 --> 37:34.463
<i>She's going to detonate.</i>

37:35.787 --> 37:38.468
We have a problem.
The signal cannot be jammed.

37:38.589 --> 37:39.783
<i>[breaking up]</i>
<i>I repeat, the signal...</i>

37:40.624 --> 37:42.458
OLIVIA: <i>Peter, I think we just</i>
<i>lost radio contact.</i>

37:42.526 --> 37:44.138
- <i>We need to find Gordon.</i>
- Copy that.

37:44.561 --> 37:45.861
<i>The trigger's</i>
<i>been activated,</i>

37:45.929 --> 37:46.955
<i>we don't have much time.</i>

37:47.064 --> 37:48.431
[static noises]

37:48.498 --> 37:49.765
I don't know who you are.

37:51.301 --> 37:53.268
Oh, my God!

37:59.432 --> 38:00.436
I spotted Gordon.

38:00.471 --> 38:01.991
I'm taking him out.

38:04.380 --> 38:05.379
[grunts]

38:05.447 --> 38:06.650
[struggling]

38:13.721 --> 38:15.842
Ah! Ugh!

38:21.228 --> 38:22.263
Twenty-four Mississippi.

38:22.396 --> 38:23.984
<i>Twenty-five Mississippi.</i>

38:24.031 --> 38:25.376
<i>Twenty-six Mississippi.</i>

38:25.411 --> 38:28.301
[static noises loud]

38:37.675 --> 38:39.340
[coughing]

38:39.679 --> 38:42.115
<i>We're back online.</i>
<i>The signal has stopped.</i>

38:42.150 --> 38:43.140
BROYLES:
<i>All agents, move in.</i>

38:44.050 --> 38:45.217
[struggles]

38:45.285 --> 38:46.154
AGENT: <i>FBI!</i>

38:46.653 --> 38:48.073
Ugh!

38:51.324 --> 38:53.359
[wheezing]

39:02.069 --> 39:03.748
[clapping]

39:39.173 --> 39:40.176
What's this?

39:40.441 --> 39:41.329
An apartment.

39:42.443 --> 39:44.540
Two bedroom, semi-detached.

39:45.330 --> 39:47.707
Furnished housing
for professors.

39:49.112 --> 39:50.416
It's a nice neighborhood.

39:50.885 --> 39:53.067
Down the block from
where Belly used to live.

39:55.956 --> 39:59.071
I'll call Broyles,
see if we can lease it.

40:08.069 --> 40:10.129
Okay,
seven and a quarter inches.

40:10.304 --> 40:12.497
- Hmm.
- Why "hmm"?

40:12.840 --> 40:15.208
Well, I think your hand
just seems smaller to me.

40:15.858 --> 40:17.434
Okay, we're good.

40:17.544 --> 40:19.250
We're good,
what does that mean?

40:20.054 --> 40:21.351
It means
that's all for tonight.

40:21.382 --> 40:22.150
Go home.

40:22.650 --> 40:23.837
[scoffs]

40:23.868 --> 40:25.084
I just got here.

40:25.152 --> 40:28.064
I know, but I'm tired.
It's been a long day.

40:28.188 --> 40:31.404
<i>You look like you could</i>
<i>use some sleep yourself.</i>

40:32.237 --> 40:33.150
Come back tomorrow.

40:33.180 --> 40:35.762
By then I'll have found you
the perfect bowling ball.

40:35.797 --> 40:37.563
No, you listen to me
you son of a bitch.

40:37.631 --> 40:39.766
I am not here to bowl,
or to try on shoes,

40:39.801 --> 40:41.595
or to have you play games
with my head.

40:41.768 --> 40:44.381
I am here because I was told
that you could fix me.

41:01.624 --> 41:03.136
Take care, Agent Dunham.

41:11.601 --> 41:14.144
GORDON: <i>Meanwhile, we go</i>
<i>through our lives unaware.</i>

41:14.571 --> 41:16.051
<i>The enemy is among us</i>

41:16.306 --> 41:18.401
<i>and nobody's doing</i>
<i>anything about it.</i>

41:18.676 --> 41:21.226
We don't have any idea
the end is coming.

41:21.412 --> 41:24.821
So we had to take matters
into our own hands.

41:25.674 --> 41:27.791
We had to send them
a message.

41:29.196 --> 41:31.264
What was in the briefcase?

41:35.893 --> 41:38.076
They told you I was crazy,
didn't they?

41:38.163 --> 41:39.614
The Pentagon.

41:41.333 --> 41:44.078
They said I'd had
a psychiatric break.

41:44.954 --> 41:47.383
I told them
what I'm telling you.

41:47.845 --> 41:49.067
That they are here.

41:49.241 --> 41:51.035
Collecting data.

41:51.577 --> 41:53.415
Making observations.

41:56.281 --> 41:58.460
That's what's
in the briefcase.

41:59.487 --> 42:01.864
They've been
planning for war.

42:03.155 --> 42:06.491
And they've been passing
the information via courier

42:07.719 --> 42:09.575
right under our noses.

42:16.602 --> 42:18.213
Who are "they"?

42:19.252 --> 42:20.895
We don't know
who they are.

42:22.382 --> 42:24.507
But I can tell you
what they want.

42:25.431 --> 42:27.418
They want
to exterminate us.

42:28.281 --> 42:30.350
So they're studying us...

42:30.385 --> 42:34.130
Our culture, our technology,
our science...

42:34.282 --> 42:37.189
and they plan
to use it against us.

42:38.291 --> 42:39.683
One way or another.

42:40.360 --> 42:42.372
We'll find out
who they are.

42:42.407 --> 42:43.578
[clicking]

42:44.164 --> 42:48.232
But by then, I suppose
it won't really matter.

42:48.871 --> 42:51.489
Because whatever is
in those cases

42:51.638 --> 42:53.893
is going
to destroy us all.
