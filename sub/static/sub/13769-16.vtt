Does this chip

00:53.387 --> 00:55.556
look funny to you?

00:56.390 --> 00:57.558
Nope. It's fine.

00:57.599 --> 00:58.976
Ha, ha. You took

00:57.599 --> 00:58.976
the last one.

00:59.018 --> 01:00.101
You have to refill it.

01:00.143 --> 01:01.269
Oh, darn it.

01:01.311 --> 01:03.605
(laughs)

01:03.647 --> 01:05.691
Oh, great.

01:05.733 --> 01:06.984
It's an ant.

01:07.026 --> 01:08.109
I know.

01:08.151 --> 01:09.152
I saw him before.

01:09.194 --> 01:10.988
No, Dewey, you

01:09.194 --> 01:10.988
don't understand.

01:11.030 --> 01:12.113
This one's the scout.

01:12.155 --> 01:13.782
If he finds anything

01:12.155 --> 01:13.782
appetizing,

01:13.824 --> 01:15.910
soon there'll be lots

01:13.824 --> 01:15.910
and lots of ants.

01:15.951 --> 01:17.745
Which is why I'm

01:15.951 --> 01:17.745
about to make sure

01:17.786 --> 01:20.622
that this scout doesn't

01:17.786 --> 01:20.622
report back to headquarters.

01:20.664 --> 01:22.123
LOIS:

01:20.664 --> 01:22.123
Dewey, bedtime!

01:22.165 --> 01:23.124
Ready, Dad?

01:23.166 --> 01:24.334
Bedtime express.

01:24.376 --> 01:25.544
Oh... yeah.

01:25.586 --> 01:27.128
Just give me a second here to...

01:27.170 --> 01:28.296
Hidey-ho!

01:27.170 --> 01:28.296
Oh!

01:28.338 --> 01:29.423
And away we go!

01:29.464 --> 01:31.008
Giddy-up, Dad!

01:29.464 --> 01:31.008
(whinnies)

01:31.050 --> 01:32.342
(grunts)

01:32.384 --> 01:34.135
Turn, horsey, turn!

01:32.384 --> 01:34.135
(whinnies)

01:34.177 --> 01:37.138
I got the nicest dress

01:34.177 --> 01:37.138
for the school formal.

01:37.180 --> 01:39.182
It's satiny and long,

01:39.224 --> 01:41.769
and-and what's that color

01:39.224 --> 01:41.769
between pink and purple?

01:41.810 --> 01:42.978
Mauve.

01:43.020 --> 01:44.563
Oh, sorry.

01:46.023 --> 01:47.816
Isn't she cute

01:46.023 --> 01:47.816
when she gets excited?

01:47.858 --> 01:49.150
Her cheeks get all red,

01:49.192 --> 01:51.194
and then she gets

01:49.192 --> 01:51.194
a little twinkle in her eye.

01:51.236 --> 01:53.154
I've got to tell you,

01:51.236 --> 01:53.154
I'm a lucky guy.

01:53.196 --> 01:54.448
So you're really

01:53.196 --> 01:54.448
going to spring

01:54.489 --> 01:55.950
for a limo and tux

01:54.489 --> 01:55.950
and all that?

01:55.991 --> 01:57.618
Hell, no. We're not going

01:55.991 --> 01:57.618
to that dance.

01:57.659 --> 01:59.870
It would practically wipe out

01:57.659 --> 01:59.870
my leather jacket fund.

01:59.912 --> 02:01.162
What are you

01:59.912 --> 02:01.162
talking about?

02:01.204 --> 02:02.205
I've got it all worked out.

02:02.247 --> 02:03.958
I let her think we're going,

02:03.999 --> 02:06.167
and then right before the dance,

02:03.999 --> 02:06.167
I pick a giant fight.

02:06.209 --> 02:08.169
She gets so mad at me,

02:06.209 --> 02:08.169
she doesn't want to go,

02:08.211 --> 02:09.170
and then the next day,

02:09.212 --> 02:11.172
I apologize,

02:09.212 --> 02:11.172
she takes me back,

02:11.214 --> 02:13.467
and it's smooth sailing

02:11.214 --> 02:13.467
until her birthday.

02:13.508 --> 02:14.635
MAN:

02:13.508 --> 02:14.635
Malcolm!

02:14.676 --> 02:15.970
Where have you been?

02:16.011 --> 02:17.763
I called an emergency

02:16.011 --> 02:17.763
study session.

02:17.805 --> 02:20.808
What? We just had an emergency

02:17.805 --> 02:20.808
study session last night.

02:20.849 --> 02:22.183
This is the Academic Octathlon.

02:22.225 --> 02:24.103
We are pitted

02:22.225 --> 02:24.103
against the brightest minds

02:24.144 --> 02:25.813
from every high school

02:24.144 --> 02:25.813
in the country.

02:25.854 --> 02:27.815
From now on, we will work

02:25.854 --> 02:27.815
through lunch every day.

02:27.856 --> 02:29.274
I thought this was supposed

02:27.856 --> 02:29.274
to be fun.

02:29.316 --> 02:30.484
Fun... is for losers.

02:30.525 --> 02:32.444
We're all making

02:30.525 --> 02:32.444
sacrifices, Malcolm.

02:32.486 --> 02:34.863
I've had to blow off

02:32.486 --> 02:34.863
my cello lessons.

02:34.905 --> 02:36.490
I missed my uncle's funeral.

02:36.531 --> 02:39.200
I've been tanking my grades

02:36.531 --> 02:39.200
for the past three months

02:39.242 --> 02:41.495
so I could be our team's

02:39.242 --> 02:41.495
mandatory "C" student.

02:41.536 --> 02:42.871
(grunts loudly)

02:42.913 --> 02:44.665
That food is not there

02:42.913 --> 02:44.665
for you to eat,

02:44.706 --> 02:46.792
it is there so I don't get into

02:44.706 --> 02:46.792
trouble for making you work

02:46.834 --> 02:48.669
through lunch. Now focus!

02:48.710 --> 02:49.920
Why  can't  I quit?

02:49.962 --> 02:51.212
This is  stupid!

02:51.254 --> 02:52.589
Extracurriculars

02:51.254 --> 02:52.589
are very important.

02:52.631 --> 02:55.843
You think you can coast

02:52.631 --> 02:55.843
into college on straight A's?

02:55.884 --> 02:57.094
Well, you can't.

02:57.136 --> 02:58.595
Besides, this is

02:57.136 --> 02:58.595
a good opportunity

02:58.637 --> 03:00.221
to meet other smart kids.

03:00.263 --> 03:01.849
You're never too young

03:00.263 --> 03:01.849
to start making contacts.

03:01.890 --> 03:04.225
Yeah, make friends for life

03:01.890 --> 03:04.225
at a nerdfest.

03:04.267 --> 03:06.020
It's not nerdy

03:04.267 --> 03:06.020
to spend a weekend

03:06.061 --> 03:08.522
winning a trophy that shows

03:06.061 --> 03:08.522
how smart you are!

03:09.731 --> 03:12.191
Well, you're doing it anyway.

03:15.362 --> 03:17.322
Oh, geez, not the cabinets, too.

03:17.364 --> 03:20.241
Honey, where did I put

03:17.364 --> 03:20.241
the ant spray?

03:20.283 --> 03:22.243
Hey, Dad, time

03:20.283 --> 03:22.243
for bedtime express.

03:22.285 --> 03:23.453
Uh, yeah.

03:23.495 --> 03:26.247
Dewey, look, I-I

03:23.495 --> 03:26.247
want to talk to you.

03:26.289 --> 03:27.708
Uh, you're

03:26.289 --> 03:27.708
getting bigger,

03:27.749 --> 03:29.250
and-and there's a

03:27.749 --> 03:29.250
lot of great things

03:29.292 --> 03:30.752
about being a big boy,

03:30.794 --> 03:33.839
but big boys don't get

03:30.794 --> 03:33.839
to do bedtime express,

03:33.881 --> 03:37.258
because it hurts Daddy,

03:33.881 --> 03:37.258
so even though it's fun,

03:37.300 --> 03:39.887
we're not going to do

03:37.300 --> 03:39.887
bedtime express anymore.

03:39.928 --> 03:42.056
Okay.

03:42.097 --> 03:44.058
Oh, good.

03:44.099 --> 03:46.060
Then I won't love you anymore.

03:46.101 --> 03:47.268
What?

03:47.310 --> 03:48.937
I won't love you anymore.

03:48.979 --> 03:50.772
Dewey, you can't just

03:48.979 --> 03:50.772
say something like that

03:50.814 --> 03:52.273
because you're upset.

03:52.315 --> 03:54.860
I'm sorry, but I can't help

03:52.315 --> 03:54.860
the way I feel.

03:54.902 --> 03:57.112
Good night, Dad.

03:59.489 --> 04:01.200
Reese, did you get

03:59.489 --> 04:01.200
your tux yet?

04:01.241 --> 04:02.951
Uh, the dance is

04:01.241 --> 04:02.951
in two days.

04:02.993 --> 04:04.327
Of course I

04:02.993 --> 04:04.327
got my tux.

04:04.369 --> 04:06.287
Good. Hey, look at this.

04:06.329 --> 04:07.372
It's my dress.

04:07.414 --> 04:09.290
Isn't it amazing?

04:09.332 --> 04:11.919
Are you sure this is

04:09.332 --> 04:11.919
going to fit because...

04:11.960 --> 04:14.713
you're so fat.

04:15.547 --> 04:16.924
(laughs)

04:16.965 --> 04:19.300
Oh, you're such

04:16.965 --> 04:19.300
a goofball sometimes.

04:19.342 --> 04:20.385
Anyway, I really

04:19.342 --> 04:20.385
like these bows.

04:20.427 --> 04:21.929
Maybe I should get

04:20.427 --> 04:21.929
matching shoes,

04:21.970 --> 04:23.847
but I don't want it

04:21.970 --> 04:23.847
to look too outfit-y.

04:25.390 --> 04:26.975
Hey, honey,

04:27.017 --> 04:28.309
you won't believe

04:27.017 --> 04:28.309
the day I had.

04:28.351 --> 04:29.770
I had a pretty

04:28.351 --> 04:29.770
interesting day, too.

04:29.811 --> 04:30.979
I had to wear these

04:31.021 --> 04:32.564
filthy clothes to work

04:32.606 --> 04:33.982
because you forgot to pick up

04:32.606 --> 04:33.982
the dry cleaning again.

04:34.024 --> 04:35.109
For crying out loud,

04:35.150 --> 04:36.735
I just got off a 12-hour shift.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.361
The last thing

04:36.777 --> 04:38.361
I need is for you to...

04:38.403 --> 04:40.989
You know what?

04:41.031 --> 04:42.741
Let's not do this.

04:42.783 --> 04:43.533
Do what?

04:43.575 --> 04:44.743
Fight.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.327
We argue way too much.

04:46.369 --> 04:47.955
You're right.

04:47.996 --> 04:50.331
Why can't we just both

04:47.996 --> 04:50.331
shut up for once

04:50.373 --> 04:53.334
and give ourselves time

04:50.373 --> 04:53.334
to be in love with each other?

04:53.376 --> 04:56.630
Let's just...

04:53.376 --> 04:56.630
not talk about it.

04:58.840 --> 05:02.010
I am having the best time

04:58.840 --> 05:02.010
with Piama today.

05:02.052 --> 05:04.345
It's like every moment

05:02.052 --> 05:04.345
was perfect,

05:04.387 --> 05:06.056
and-and seemed

05:04.387 --> 05:06.056
to blend perfectly

05:06.098 --> 05:07.390
into the next perfect moment.

05:07.432 --> 05:10.602
I have had 25 years

05:07.432 --> 05:10.602
of days like that

05:10.644 --> 05:12.229
with my Gretchen.

05:12.271 --> 05:15.065
I heard that, schminky pants.

05:16.275 --> 05:18.568
I will save this

05:16.275 --> 05:18.568
for later.

05:18.610 --> 05:20.237
(laughs)

05:20.279 --> 05:22.906
See, when marriage works,

05:20.279 --> 05:22.906
there is nothing like it.

05:24.699 --> 05:26.994
Now let me ask you something.

05:27.035 --> 05:28.203
You and Gretchen--

05:28.245 --> 05:29.370
you never argue

05:28.245 --> 05:29.370
about chores, right?

05:29.412 --> 05:30.998
Like, if there's an errand

05:29.412 --> 05:30.998
to be run,

05:31.039 --> 05:33.959
you do it, she does it,

05:31.039 --> 05:33.959
who cares?

05:34.001 --> 05:36.837
I never really thought about it.

05:36.878 --> 05:39.089
I am sick and tired of

05:36.878 --> 05:39.089
doing all of these chores!

05:39.131 --> 05:40.299
Ooh!

05:40.339 --> 05:41.549
I work hard all day!

05:41.591 --> 05:44.094
I work like a dog,

05:41.591 --> 05:44.094
and you don't appreciate it!

05:44.136 --> 05:46.387
You just spend money

05:44.136 --> 05:46.387
on whatever you want!

05:46.429 --> 05:47.430
I  spend?!

05:47.472 --> 05:48.974
You spend money

05:49.016 --> 05:51.392
like we have a key to

05:49.016 --> 05:51.392
the mint or someplace!

06:09.452 --> 06:11.246
Octathletes, I have news.

06:11.288 --> 06:13.081
One of my informers has just

06:11.288 --> 06:13.081
reported to me

06:13.123 --> 06:15.334
that the science portion

06:13.123 --> 06:15.334
of this competition will be

06:15.374 --> 06:17.794
based on organic chemistry,

06:15.374 --> 06:17.794
so break out your textbooks.

06:17.836 --> 06:20.421
We'll start

06:17.836 --> 06:20.421
with chapters 23, 24,

06:20.463 --> 06:21.422
42, 44, 45...

06:21.464 --> 06:22.924
Sir?

06:22.966 --> 06:24.718
I'm supposed to take

06:22.966 --> 06:24.718
a two-hour nap on the bus,

06:24.759 --> 06:25.927
or I'll get cranky.

06:25.969 --> 06:27.470
Of course. Would you like us all

06:27.512 --> 06:29.430
to sing you a lullaby,

06:27.512 --> 06:29.430
or perhaps,

06:29.472 --> 06:32.017
I could wad up my jacket

06:29.472 --> 06:32.017
and make a pillow for you?

06:32.059 --> 06:33.852
I have my own pillow,

06:32.059 --> 06:33.852
thank you.

06:33.894 --> 06:36.063
I just need some help

06:33.894 --> 06:36.063
blowing it up.

06:36.104 --> 06:37.689
I've had it

06:36.104 --> 06:37.689
with this bellyaching!

06:37.731 --> 06:39.440
If any of you are not fully

06:37.731 --> 06:39.440
committed to this team,

06:39.482 --> 06:41.860
you are more than welcome

06:39.482 --> 06:41.860
to get off the bus right now.

06:41.902 --> 06:43.444
Driver, open the doors.

06:43.486 --> 06:44.445
(bus slows down)

06:44.487 --> 06:46.447
I did not say stop.

06:46.489 --> 06:48.367
I said open the doors.

06:54.497 --> 06:56.333
That silly fighting.

06:56.375 --> 06:58.668
Let us never do that again.

06:58.710 --> 07:00.128
That is not us.

07:00.170 --> 07:01.462
No.

07:01.504 --> 07:02.923
I don't know what came over me.

07:02.964 --> 07:04.841
Oh, me, neither, hmm?

07:04.883 --> 07:08.636
We will never speak

07:04.883 --> 07:08.636
of this again, hmm?

07:08.678 --> 07:09.930
Of what?

07:09.971 --> 07:11.181
See, I already forgot it.

07:11.223 --> 07:13.474
(laughing)

07:13.516 --> 07:14.475
Here...

07:14.517 --> 07:15.852
Here you are.

07:14.517 --> 07:15.852
Oh, thank you.

07:15.894 --> 07:17.104
I am sure you two

07:17.145 --> 07:18.897
will be very happy here.

07:18.939 --> 07:21.316
We could be happy  anywhere.

07:21.358 --> 07:22.150
Aw.

07:25.528 --> 07:28.407
Let me ask you something.

07:29.532 --> 07:30.742
I do plenty of

07:29.532 --> 07:30.742
chores, okay?!

07:29.532 --> 07:30.742
Yeah, right!

07:30.784 --> 07:32.286
You may not

07:30.784 --> 07:32.286
realize it,

07:32.327 --> 07:33.536
because you're out

07:32.327 --> 07:33.536
throwing our money away!

07:33.578 --> 07:35.205
Oh, here we go!

07:33.578 --> 07:35.205
By the way,

07:35.247 --> 07:36.790
are we actually going to

07:35.247 --> 07:36.790
have sex on this vacation,

07:36.831 --> 07:38.833
or is it going to be

07:36.831 --> 07:38.833
St. Croix all over again?!

07:42.003 --> 07:43.130
(grunts)

07:43.171 --> 07:45.506
I've got

07:43.171 --> 07:45.506
to get a stronger spray!

07:45.548 --> 07:47.342
Dewey, I'm going to

07:45.548 --> 07:47.342
the hardware store.

07:47.384 --> 07:49.428
I'll be back soon.

07:47.384 --> 07:49.428
Love you.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.221
That's nice.

07:51.263 --> 07:52.597
Okay, this is crazy.

07:52.639 --> 07:54.224
You can't  not  love me

07:54.266 --> 07:56.517
just because I won't

07:54.266 --> 07:56.517
give you bedtime rides.

07:56.559 --> 07:57.518
Yes, I can.

07:57.560 --> 07:58.812
(laughs)

07:58.853 --> 08:00.439
Oh, this is not

07:58.853 --> 08:00.439
going to work, mister.

08:00.521 --> 08:01.564
I know you love me.

08:01.606 --> 08:02.941
I like you.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.525
And that's it?

08:04.567 --> 08:05.610
I think you're a nice man.

08:05.652 --> 08:07.195
Fine. You know what?

08:07.237 --> 08:08.696
Maybe you need to spend

08:07.237 --> 08:08.696
some time in your room

08:08.738 --> 08:10.365
and think about

08:08.738 --> 08:10.365
this a while, okay?

08:10.407 --> 08:11.825
As of right now,

08:10.407 --> 08:11.825
you are grounded!

08:11.866 --> 08:13.410
Okay.

08:13.452 --> 08:15.370
And then tomorrow...

08:15.412 --> 08:17.414
I'm going to buy you

08:15.412 --> 08:17.414
a brand-new bicycle.

08:17.456 --> 08:19.749
It's not going

08:17.456 --> 08:19.749
to change anything.

08:23.586 --> 08:24.754
Food fight!

08:25.839 --> 08:27.548
What the hell are you doing?!

08:27.590 --> 08:28.591
Come on! It's

08:27.590 --> 08:28.591
a food fight.

08:28.633 --> 08:29.759
No, it's not.

08:29.801 --> 08:31.345
You're just throwing

08:29.801 --> 08:31.345
egg salad at me.

08:31.386 --> 08:33.930
Yeah, 'cause that's the kind

08:31.386 --> 08:33.930
of thing I think is fun.

08:33.972 --> 08:35.598
You are such a jerk!

08:35.640 --> 08:36.850
That's it!

08:36.891 --> 08:39.019
I don't ever want

08:36.891 --> 08:39.019
to see you again.

08:39.060 --> 08:41.480
Until the dance!

08:51.323 --> 08:52.573
Here it is, children.

08:52.615 --> 08:53.741
The battlefield.

08:53.783 --> 08:54.742
Get comfortable with it.

08:54.784 --> 08:56.244
Make it your own.

08:56.286 --> 08:58.579
I'm getting a panic rash

08:56.286 --> 08:58.579
over my homesick rash.

08:58.621 --> 08:59.747
Suck it up, people.

08:59.789 --> 09:01.166
Tomorrow is the finals.

09:01.208 --> 09:02.750
Now, do you see that

09:01.208 --> 09:02.750
air conditioning vent?

09:02.792 --> 09:04.503
Jefferson High has three

09:02.792 --> 09:04.503
asthmatics on their team.

09:04.544 --> 09:06.463
If we could just get them

09:04.544 --> 09:06.463
to sit directly beneath...

09:06.505 --> 09:08.382
Mr. Baffert.

09:06.505 --> 09:08.382
Oh, you've done it again.

09:08.423 --> 09:10.050
What a stellar job

09:08.423 --> 09:10.050
at organizing...

09:10.091 --> 09:11.676
Don't suck up, Lionel.

09:11.718 --> 09:13.136
It's pathetic.

09:14.262 --> 09:15.514
Don't worry, sir.

09:15.555 --> 09:16.597
We were ready

09:15.555 --> 09:16.597
to grab your ankles

09:16.639 --> 09:17.765
if you got too far up there.

09:17.807 --> 09:19.226
Hey, Herkabe.

09:19.267 --> 09:21.019
Surprised to see you

09:19.267 --> 09:21.019
and your band of bed-wetters

09:21.061 --> 09:22.312
had the guts to show up.

09:22.354 --> 09:25.190
Oh, look, it's North High.

09:25.232 --> 09:27.192
Nous les nourrirons

09:25.232 --> 09:27.192
leurs propres entrailles

09:27.234 --> 09:28.235
et fait les demande plus.

09:28.276 --> 09:30.778
(laughter)

09:30.820 --> 09:32.113
Oh, my God.

09:32.155 --> 09:34.282
They brought in Rubinger

09:32.155 --> 09:34.282
from Minnesota.

09:34.324 --> 09:35.700
Who?

09:34.324 --> 09:35.700
IBM's been studying him.

09:35.742 --> 09:37.327
Rumor has it

09:35.742 --> 09:37.327
he was a Siamese twin

09:37.369 --> 09:38.537
that got both brains.

09:39.454 --> 09:41.248
Walk with me.

09:43.124 --> 09:44.667
You see those little freaks

09:43.124 --> 09:44.667
over there

09:44.709 --> 09:45.919
that you call friends now?

09:45.960 --> 09:47.337
They need to win here

09:47.379 --> 09:48.671
so they can get into

09:47.379 --> 09:48.671
one of the top colleges

09:48.713 --> 09:50.131
because that's the only way

09:50.173 --> 09:51.632
they're going to become

09:50.173 --> 09:51.632
successful enough

09:51.674 --> 09:53.009
so that people don't

09:51.674 --> 09:53.009
beat them up every day

09:53.051 --> 09:54.344
for the rest of their lives.

09:54.386 --> 09:55.636
Now, are you going

09:54.386 --> 09:55.636
to deny them that?

09:55.678 --> 09:56.637
I'll try my best.

09:56.679 --> 09:57.638
Good. Now, the judges

09:57.680 --> 09:59.640
will spot Morse code easily,

09:59.682 --> 10:01.851
so I've developed this

09:59.682 --> 10:01.851
rudimentary fingertip semaphore.

10:01.893 --> 10:03.311
Memorize this.

10:03.353 --> 10:04.645
You want me to cheat?

10:04.687 --> 10:06.647
Let's call it...

10:06.689 --> 10:07.732
success advantaging.

10:07.774 --> 10:09.609
Forget it.

10:07.774 --> 10:09.609
I'm not going to cheat.

10:10.693 --> 10:12.653
Guys...

10:12.695 --> 10:14.573
Guys, you're not going

10:12.695 --> 10:14.573
to believe this.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.157
Herkabe actually wants us

10:14.614 --> 10:16.157
to cheat.

10:16.199 --> 10:18.076
What? That isn't right!

10:18.118 --> 10:19.911
Yeah, he's not supposed

10:18.118 --> 10:19.911
to write it down.

10:19.953 --> 10:20.912
That's a paper trail.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.663
You guys are in on this?

10:22.705 --> 10:23.664
Malcolm, you have no idea.

10:23.706 --> 10:24.832
This is big.

10:24.874 --> 10:26.167
This goes further

10:24.874 --> 10:26.167
than you know.

10:26.209 --> 10:27.752
Further than you guys?

10:27.794 --> 10:28.920
Oh.

10:28.962 --> 10:30.380
Then you do know.

10:34.092 --> 10:37.095
Are you in...

10:34.092 --> 10:37.095
or are you...

10:37.137 --> 10:39.389
out?

10:49.774 --> 10:51.401
MAN:

10:49.774 --> 10:51.401
Hey! Hey!

10:51.443 --> 10:54.112
I'm the one who has to fix that

10:51.443 --> 10:54.112
if you break it.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.489
Sorry. You work here?

10:55.530 --> 10:56.531
My dad's the manager.

10:56.573 --> 10:57.698
You know,

10:56.573 --> 10:57.698
for a bunch of dweebs,

10:57.740 --> 10:59.409
you guys sure cause

10:57.740 --> 10:59.409
a lot of trouble.

10:59.451 --> 11:00.910
I can't believe

10:59.451 --> 11:00.910
you put on SPF45.

11:00.952 --> 11:02.703
It's an indoor pool.

11:02.745 --> 11:04.789
But we have to cross through

11:02.745 --> 11:04.789
the courtyard to get there.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.001
How can you be around them

11:06.333 --> 11:08.001
for more than ten seconds

11:08.042 --> 11:09.336
and not want to deck one?

11:09.377 --> 11:11.421
Trust me, it's not

11:09.377 --> 11:11.421
that satisfying.

11:11.463 --> 11:13.632
Plus, some of them

11:11.463 --> 11:13.632
are my friends.

11:13.672 --> 11:15.133
Were my friends.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.343
No, still are.

11:16.384 --> 11:18.011
I'm just not

11:16.384 --> 11:18.011
happy about it.

11:18.052 --> 11:19.887
What would you do

11:18.052 --> 11:19.887
if your friends

11:19.929 --> 11:21.764
wanted you to do something

11:19.929 --> 11:21.764
you didn't want to do?

11:21.806 --> 11:24.225
Not do it.

11:21.806 --> 11:24.225
Yeah, but see,

11:21.806 --> 11:24.225
that won't work.

11:24.267 --> 11:26.102
Because even if I don't,

11:24.267 --> 11:26.102
they're going to do it anyway.

11:26.144 --> 11:27.979
And that makes me a part of it,

11:26.144 --> 11:27.979
whether I do it or not,

11:28.021 --> 11:29.772
so there's no way out.

11:29.814 --> 11:32.733
Um, there's probably some kind

11:29.814 --> 11:32.733
of obvious smart-guy reason

11:32.775 --> 11:36.571
I'm missing here,

11:32.775 --> 11:36.571
but... can't you just leave?

11:38.990 --> 11:41.535
Reese! How many times

11:38.990 --> 11:41.535
have I told you?

11:41.576 --> 11:42.827
No ice cream

11:41.576 --> 11:42.827
in the living room.

11:42.869 --> 11:44.703
You're dripping

11:42.869 --> 11:44.703
all over the rug!

11:46.164 --> 11:48.166
Are you crazy?!

11:48.208 --> 11:50.126
No, just extremely

11:48.208 --> 11:50.126
disrespectful.

11:50.168 --> 11:51.752
I mean, what are

11:50.168 --> 11:51.752
you going to do

11:51.794 --> 11:53.754
with a kid like me?

11:51.794 --> 11:53.754
Ground me?

11:53.796 --> 11:54.755
You bet I am.

11:54.797 --> 11:55.923
One week in your room.

11:55.965 --> 11:57.425
No TV, no video games,

11:57.467 --> 11:59.386
no contact

11:57.467 --> 11:59.386
with the outside world.

11:59.427 --> 12:01.555
After you take Alison

11:59.427 --> 12:01.555
to the dance.

12:01.596 --> 12:02.556
What?!

12:02.597 --> 12:03.806
Reese, you made a promise

12:03.848 --> 12:05.183
to that girl

12:03.848 --> 12:05.183
and you are going to keep it.

12:05.225 --> 12:06.685
But... how did you...?

12:06.725 --> 12:08.562
Look, Reese,

12:06.725 --> 12:08.562
some people are born book-smart.

12:08.603 --> 12:10.813
Others are born crafty

12:08.603 --> 12:10.813
and street-smart.

12:10.855 --> 12:12.773
You, I'm afraid, are neither.

12:12.815 --> 12:14.733
(phone ringing)

12:15.527 --> 12:17.237
Hello?

12:17.278 --> 12:18.279
Mom, come get me.

12:18.321 --> 12:19.822
Look, I have to get out of here.

12:19.864 --> 12:21.491
I'm leaving either way.

12:21.533 --> 12:23.702
If you're not here

12:21.533 --> 12:23.702
within the next three hours,

12:23.742 --> 12:26.037
you can find me walking

12:23.742 --> 12:26.037
on the highway, in the dark.

12:26.079 --> 12:27.372
Or maybe I'll hitchhike.

12:27.414 --> 12:28.665
You know,

12:27.414 --> 12:28.665
I met this guy with a van.

12:28.707 --> 12:30.124
He seemed real friendly.

12:34.045 --> 12:36.256
You should do more chores!

12:36.381 --> 12:39.259
I'm too tired.

12:36.381 --> 12:39.259
You should spend less money!

12:39.300 --> 12:42.803
We never have sex!

12:39.300 --> 12:42.803
Are you too tired for that?

12:42.845 --> 12:45.848
How can we when your parents

12:42.845 --> 12:45.848
are always visiting?

12:51.563 --> 12:53.231
I cannot wait until I am old

12:51.563 --> 12:53.231
and senile.

12:53.273 --> 12:54.691
I'm going to be

12:54.733 --> 12:55.983
hooked up to life support

12:54.733 --> 12:55.983
in your attic

12:56.025 --> 12:58.236
running you ragged with

12:56.025 --> 12:58.236
crazy old person demands.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.238
I am going to cling

12:58.278 --> 13:00.238
to life for years

13:00.280 --> 13:01.656
just to make you suffer.

13:01.698 --> 13:03.241
Fine. But I'm not staying here.

13:11.916 --> 13:13.376
That son of a...

13:14.877 --> 13:15.754
Stop the car!

13:15.794 --> 13:16.837
What?

13:15.794 --> 13:16.837
Stop!

13:16.879 --> 13:17.838
(tires screech)

13:17.880 --> 13:18.881
I'm staying.

13:18.923 --> 13:20.841
I will  not  be played like that!

13:20.883 --> 13:22.093
You can punish me

13:20.883 --> 13:22.093
when I get home.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.053
Deal.

13:36.733 --> 13:38.526
All right,

13:36.733 --> 13:38.526
this has gone far enough.

13:38.568 --> 13:40.320
Now, I will walk you

13:38.568 --> 13:40.320
to your room,

13:40.361 --> 13:41.862
I will roll you

13:40.361 --> 13:41.862
to your room,

13:41.904 --> 13:43.490
I will  race  you

13:41.904 --> 13:43.490
to your room,

13:43.531 --> 13:46.660
but you are too big

13:43.531 --> 13:46.660
to give bedtime rides to.

13:46.701 --> 13:47.868
If you say so.

13:47.910 --> 13:49.078
I say so.

13:49.120 --> 13:50.455
Now, as your father,

13:50.497 --> 13:52.165
I am ordering you to say,

13:50.497 --> 13:52.165
"I love you."

13:52.206 --> 13:53.874
I love you.

13:53.916 --> 13:56.586
Now say it

13:53.916 --> 13:56.586
in a convincing manner.

13:56.628 --> 13:58.546
I love you.

13:58.588 --> 14:00.465
Now say it

13:58.588 --> 14:00.465
without me telling you to.

14:00.507 --> 14:01.882
Is this going

14:00.507 --> 14:01.882
to take long?

14:01.924 --> 14:03.718
'Cause I was going

14:01.924 --> 14:03.718
to get a soda.

14:03.760 --> 14:05.970
Unless I'm too  big

14:03.760 --> 14:05.970
to drink soda.

14:06.012 --> 14:08.222
Just go.

14:09.932 --> 14:11.934
Oh, for crying out loud.

14:11.976 --> 14:14.521
These things are everywhere!

14:19.567 --> 14:21.778
I don't know, Malcolm.

14:21.820 --> 14:24.489
This seems like

14:21.820 --> 14:24.489
a very drastic escalation.

14:24.531 --> 14:26.199
You want to cheat,

14:24.531 --> 14:26.199
right?

14:26.240 --> 14:27.992
Since this is just

14:26.240 --> 14:27.992
a big cheating contest,

14:28.034 --> 14:29.910
I say we out-cheat

14:28.034 --> 14:29.910
everyone else.

14:29.952 --> 14:31.996
Why do I have to be the one

14:29.952 --> 14:31.996
who does this?

14:32.038 --> 14:33.832
'Cause you look the most

14:32.038 --> 14:33.832
pathetic in a bathing suit.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.292
I do not!

14:33.873 --> 14:36.292
What about...?

14:36.334 --> 14:37.752
Yeah, okay.

14:37.794 --> 14:38.878
Go, Stevie.

14:39.962 --> 14:42.173
(yelps)

14:44.884 --> 14:47.721
Uh, excu-excuse me.

14:47.762 --> 14:49.389
I got locked out

14:47.762 --> 14:49.389
of my room,

14:49.430 --> 14:52.933
and I forgot my towel

14:49.430 --> 14:52.933
and I'm very cold.

14:52.975 --> 14:54.602
There you go.

14:54.644 --> 14:55.936
Have a nice day.

14:55.978 --> 14:57.772
Thank you.

14:57.814 --> 14:59.899
I've been swimming!

15:00.983 --> 15:02.235
Good job.

15:00.983 --> 15:02.235
I'll be out in a minute.

15:02.276 --> 15:03.862
WOMAN:

15:02.276 --> 15:03.862
I do all the chores,

15:03.903 --> 15:05.321
I make all the money

15:03.903 --> 15:05.321
and I'm sorry

15:05.363 --> 15:07.114
if I'm a little tired

15:05.363 --> 15:07.114
when we get into the bedroom!

15:07.156 --> 15:08.867
That's why we took

15:07.156 --> 15:08.867
this vacation!

15:08.908 --> 15:10.535
We took this vacation to

15:08.908 --> 15:10.535
get away from your parents.

15:10.577 --> 15:12.119
You have no clue.

15:10.577 --> 15:12.119
Because you never tell me

15:12.161 --> 15:13.954
what you're thinking!

15:12.161 --> 15:13.954
I'm not a mind-reader!

15:13.996 --> 15:14.955
I got the answers.

15:14.997 --> 15:16.165
I'm going

15:14.997 --> 15:16.165
to go make copies.

15:16.207 --> 15:17.417
You guys stay here

15:17.458 --> 15:19.001
and keep the door open

15:17.458 --> 15:19.001
till I get back.

15:20.795 --> 15:24.006
Everybody...

15:20.795 --> 15:24.006
look casual.

15:30.847 --> 15:32.640
Now let's see you chicken out.

15:37.103 --> 15:38.229
What are you doing?

15:37.103 --> 15:38.229
(gasps)

15:38.271 --> 15:40.022
It's not what

15:38.271 --> 15:40.022
it looks like.

15:40.064 --> 15:41.816
It looks like you're trying

15:40.064 --> 15:41.816
to break your foot

15:41.858 --> 15:43.860
just so you don't have to go

15:41.858 --> 15:43.860
to the dance with me.

15:43.902 --> 15:44.861
Ha!

15:44.903 --> 15:46.946
You couldn't be more wrong.

15:49.240 --> 15:50.617
If you don't want to go with me,

15:50.658 --> 15:53.119
then why don't you just

15:50.658 --> 15:53.119
break up with me?

15:54.036 --> 15:55.622
I really like you, Alison.

15:55.663 --> 15:58.999
I just didn't want to spend

15:55.663 --> 15:58.999
all that money on the dance.

15:59.041 --> 16:01.711
I know that was selfish,

15:59.041 --> 16:01.711
and I'm really sorry.

16:01.753 --> 16:05.465
But I still really want

16:01.753 --> 16:05.465
you to be my girlfriend.

16:06.424 --> 16:09.302
Well...

16:06.424 --> 16:09.302
thanks for being honest.

16:09.343 --> 16:13.723
But you made a promise to me,

16:09.343 --> 16:13.723
and I'm going to hold you to it.

16:13.765 --> 16:15.892
You're going

16:13.765 --> 16:15.892
to get me a corsage,

16:15.934 --> 16:17.936
and you're going

16:15.934 --> 16:17.936
to rent a limo,

16:17.977 --> 16:20.313
and you're going

16:17.977 --> 16:20.313
to pick me up at 7:00,

16:20.354 --> 16:22.690
and we're going to go

16:20.354 --> 16:22.690
to the dance.

16:22.732 --> 16:24.024
Okay.

16:24.066 --> 16:25.025
You'll see.

16:25.067 --> 16:26.110
We'll have a great time.

16:26.152 --> 16:27.946
We'll dance the spotlight dance,

16:27.987 --> 16:30.824
and we'll make sure we get

16:27.987 --> 16:30.824
our picture taken together

16:30.865 --> 16:33.284
so we'll always remember

16:30.865 --> 16:33.284
this night.

16:34.452 --> 16:36.704
And then I'll break up with you

16:34.452 --> 16:36.704
forever.

16:43.377 --> 16:46.422
Someone I know was a busy

16:43.377 --> 16:46.422
little team player last night.

16:46.464 --> 16:48.215
It just came to me

16:46.464 --> 16:48.215
what the right thing to do was.

16:48.257 --> 16:51.845
I've never been prouder

16:48.257 --> 16:51.845
of you than at this moment.

16:51.886 --> 16:53.053
We never spoke.

16:53.095 --> 16:54.305
Ladies and gentlemen.

16:54.347 --> 16:58.058
We are now ready to begin

16:54.347 --> 16:58.058
round one.

16:58.100 --> 16:59.769
The subject will be history.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.480
Question one:

17:02.522 --> 17:07.067
"In 1803, the French sold over

17:02.522 --> 17:07.067
800,000 square miles..."

17:07.109 --> 17:08.361
Louisiana Purchase.

17:08.402 --> 17:09.779
Correct.

17:09.821 --> 17:11.364
(applause)

17:12.824 --> 17:14.534
Question two:

17:14.575 --> 17:16.452
"What historic document..."

17:16.494 --> 17:17.954
The Magna Carta.

17:18.788 --> 17:20.331
Correct.

17:23.793 --> 17:26.086
Question three:

17:23.793 --> 17:26.086
"Who..."

17:26.128 --> 17:27.129
Ben Franklin.

17:27.171 --> 17:29.507
That's... right.

17:29.549 --> 17:30.842
(crowd murmuring)

17:32.301 --> 17:34.387
Settle down,

17:34.428 --> 17:37.181
please.

17:37.223 --> 17:39.099
Let's try this again.

17:39.141 --> 17:40.267
Question...

17:40.309 --> 17:42.102
ALL:

17:40.309 --> 17:42.102
The defenestration of Prague!

17:42.144 --> 17:43.771
Okay...

17:43.813 --> 17:45.147
ALL:

17:43.813 --> 17:45.147
The Treaty of Utrecht!

17:45.189 --> 17:49.193
Will all coaches join me

17:45.189 --> 17:49.193
in the back?

17:51.153 --> 17:53.113
You gave everyone

17:51.153 --> 17:53.113
the test, didn't you?

17:53.155 --> 17:55.366
In fingertip semaphore,

17:53.155 --> 17:55.366
this means...

17:55.408 --> 17:56.868
I know what it means!

17:58.160 --> 18:00.120
Good night, Dad.

18:00.162 --> 18:01.956
Dewey, I-I know

18:00.162 --> 18:01.956
it's just an expression,

18:01.998 --> 18:03.624
and I'm a mature person,

18:03.666 --> 18:06.627
so if you don't want to say it,

18:03.666 --> 18:06.627
you don't have to say it.

18:06.669 --> 18:08.379
Thanks for understanding.

18:08.421 --> 18:10.048
Well, I love you!

18:10.089 --> 18:11.340
But guess what?

18:11.382 --> 18:13.133
I don't love you! And you!

18:13.175 --> 18:15.177
And I don't love you

18:13.175 --> 18:15.177
or you or you...!

18:15.219 --> 18:17.179
And I especially don't love you!

18:17.221 --> 18:19.724
And you... love...!

18:19.766 --> 18:21.601
Don't try to get away!

18:19.766 --> 18:21.601
(screams)

18:21.642 --> 18:22.602
(coughs)

18:22.643 --> 18:25.855
If you just love...

18:25.897 --> 18:30.068
I-I hate...

18:25.897 --> 18:30.068
(coughing)

18:31.027 --> 18:33.112
(weakly):

18:31.027 --> 18:33.112
Oh, no.

18:37.033 --> 18:39.869
Dad, we need

18:37.033 --> 18:39.869
more toothpaste.

18:41.037 --> 18:42.162
Dad?

18:42.204 --> 18:44.164
Dad, wake up!

18:42.204 --> 18:44.164
Get out of there!

18:44.206 --> 18:45.792
Dad!

18:45.833 --> 18:48.002
(grunting)

18:52.590 --> 18:54.050
Dad!

18:54.092 --> 18:56.176
Get up!

18:54.092 --> 18:56.176
Get up, please!

18:56.218 --> 18:58.679
Don't die, Dad.

18:56.218 --> 18:58.679
I love you!

18:58.721 --> 19:01.181
(coughing)

18:58.721 --> 19:01.181
I love you, Dad!

19:04.435 --> 19:05.979
(gasping)

19:06.020 --> 19:08.773
Are they dead?

19:08.815 --> 19:11.150
Am I dead?

19:12.610 --> 19:15.279
Well, I-I...

19:12.610 --> 19:15.279
I passed out. I...

19:15.321 --> 19:19.199
How did you pull me

19:15.321 --> 19:19.199
all the way over here?

19:19.241 --> 19:23.203
I guess...

19:19.241 --> 19:23.203
'cause I'm bigger.

19:23.245 --> 19:26.040
(laughing)

19:27.458 --> 19:29.209
Oh, good.

19:29.251 --> 19:30.252
Thank you, son.

19:30.294 --> 19:32.046
You saved my life.

19:32.088 --> 19:33.798
I love you.

19:33.840 --> 19:36.634
I love you, Dad.

19:42.849 --> 19:45.101
Well, the results are in.

19:45.143 --> 19:48.228
Since everyone

19:45.143 --> 19:48.228
was so well prepared,

19:48.270 --> 19:50.272
everybody gets a trophy.

19:50.314 --> 19:52.232
Jefferson,

19:50.314 --> 19:52.232
you win first place in science.

19:52.274 --> 19:54.318
Quincy, you win in mathematics.

19:54.360 --> 19:56.236
North High, history.

19:56.278 --> 19:58.405
St. Bartholomew, literature.

19:58.447 --> 20:00.574
And Marshall in ethics.

20:02.284 --> 20:05.872
As you can see,

20:02.284 --> 20:05.872
it's a happy ending for all,

20:05.913 --> 20:09.750
so long as everybody

20:05.913 --> 20:09.750
keeps their mouths shut.

20:09.792 --> 20:11.961
See you next year.

20:15.923 --> 20:18.092
Hey, no hard feelings, okay?

20:18.134 --> 20:21.261
I mean, I got you,

20:18.134 --> 20:21.261
you got everybody.

20:21.303 --> 20:22.847
It was kind of cool.

20:22.889 --> 20:24.098
Right. Cool.

20:24.140 --> 20:25.516
I wonder what

20:24.140 --> 20:25.516
would've happened

20:25.558 --> 20:26.851
if we'd played it straight.

20:26.893 --> 20:28.644
You know, gone

20:26.893 --> 20:28.644
head-to-head for real.

20:28.686 --> 20:30.563
You've got to be kidding.

20:30.604 --> 20:32.523
Compared to you,

20:30.604 --> 20:32.523
he's a whole other species.

20:32.565 --> 20:34.567
You should be his pet.

20:32.565 --> 20:34.567
Come on.

20:35.359 --> 20:37.695
We're sorry...

20:37.737 --> 20:39.279
we tried to...

20:39.321 --> 20:40.990
make you cheat.

20:41.032 --> 20:42.783
You're our moral compass,

20:41.032 --> 20:42.783
Malcolm.

20:42.825 --> 20:44.869
We'd like to make it up

20:42.825 --> 20:44.869
to you somehow.

20:44.911 --> 20:46.286
Let's all pick him up

20:46.328 --> 20:47.329
and carry him to the bus

20:46.328 --> 20:47.329
on our shoulders.

20:47.371 --> 20:48.915
That's a

20:47.371 --> 20:48.915
great idea.

20:47.371 --> 20:48.915
Yeah!

20:48.956 --> 20:50.917
Actually, I should

20:48.956 --> 20:50.917
sit this one out.

20:50.958 --> 20:52.793
With my middle

20:50.958 --> 20:52.793
ear condition...

20:52.835 --> 20:53.920
My scoliosis.

20:53.961 --> 20:55.337
I forgot my orthotics.

20:55.379 --> 20:57.297
Sorry. Epstein Barr.

20:57.339 --> 21:00.300
Yes, Mr. Cutler, we have

20:57.339 --> 21:00.300
your reservation right here.

21:00.342 --> 21:02.302
Hey, what time is it there

21:00.342 --> 21:02.302
in Australia?

21:02.344 --> 21:04.263
Canceling? Oh, no.

21:06.348 --> 21:09.602
Well, it's a shame to let one

21:06.348 --> 21:09.602
argument with your wife spoil...

21:09.643 --> 21:13.231
Sure, you can ask me

21:09.643 --> 21:13.231
whatever you want.

21:15.274 --> 21:17.276
Hi, honey.
