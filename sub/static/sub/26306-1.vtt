00:42.000 --> 00:44.583
<i>I have fought the good fight.</i>

00:45.458 --> 00:47.917
<i>I have finished the race.</i>

00:48.333 --> 00:50.583
<i>I have kept the faith.</i>

01:05.917 --> 01:06.750
<i>I</i>

01:07.542 --> 01:08.583
<i>am crazy.</i>

01:12.542 --> 01:13.417
<i>Seriously.</i>

01:14.333 --> 01:15.542
<i>I'm really crazy.</i>

01:16.375 --> 01:18.083
<i>There's no cure for it.</i>

01:18.167 --> 01:20.208
<i>It can't be treated.</i>

01:21.042 --> 01:21.917
<i>This illness</i>

01:22.417 --> 01:23.833
<i>is hopeless.</i>

01:40.792 --> 01:42.792
<i>The cartoon on TV earlier</i>

01:43.083 --> 01:44.708
<i>is called Super Clown.</i>

01:45.083 --> 01:47.000
<i>I don't really like this cartoon.</i>

01:47.750 --> 01:49.500
<i>But that scene of the clown fighting</i>

01:49.833 --> 01:51.333
<i>has been imprinted on my mind</i>

01:52.042 --> 01:55.167
<i>since my eighth birthday.</i>

02:03.417 --> 02:04.458
<i>Ever since that day,</i>

02:05.292 --> 02:06.792
<i>I've got this weird illness.</i>

02:07.542 --> 02:10.000
<i>I always feel
there's a clown living inside me.</i>

02:10.708 --> 02:12.333
<i>Whenever I get emotional,</i>

02:12.917 --> 02:14.917
<i>this clown would jump out.</i>

02:16.375 --> 02:17.208
<i>My brain</i>

02:17.583 --> 02:20.042
<i>would feel like it's drowning in Vodka.</i>

02:20.125 --> 02:21.500
<i>It becomes paralyzed.</i>

02:22.375 --> 02:23.458
<i>At this moment,</i>

02:24.000 --> 02:26.583
<i>the people in front of my eyes turn
into all kinds of strange creatures</i>

02:26.667 --> 02:29.208
<i>and start to attack me.</i>

02:56.792 --> 02:58.375
<i>The doctor says
it's a psychological disorder.</i>

02:58.583 --> 02:59.583
<i>I don't believe it.</i>

03:00.083 --> 03:01.583
<i>I feel that my life</i>

03:02.042 --> 03:05.208
<i>must have some mysterious connection
with clowns.</i>

03:06.875 --> 03:08.208
<i>Because people say</i>

03:08.542 --> 03:11.792
<i>that I'm a clown in life too.</i>

03:15.250 --> 03:16.250
<i>It doesn't matter.</i>

03:16.792 --> 03:18.792
<i>What matters is you keep this in mind.</i>

03:19.542 --> 03:20.375
<i>I</i>

03:20.833 --> 03:22.125
<i>am crazy.</i>

03:56.458 --> 03:57.375
Zheng Kai-si.

03:58.792 --> 03:59.875
I'm telling you,

04:00.625 --> 04:02.917
if you don't want to do this,
go tell the manager.

04:03.042 --> 04:04.958
Stop daydreaming.

04:05.458 --> 04:06.375
Hey.

04:06.458 --> 04:09.375
You won't get any bonus
if you fail to achieve this month's goal.

04:21.625 --> 04:22.833
Are you happy?

04:24.125 --> 04:24.958
Little girl.

04:25.042 --> 04:27.125
I have a small gift for you.

04:27.542 --> 04:29.000
-Thank you.
-Here's your phone.

04:29.167 --> 04:30.375
Please give me a few seconds.

06:44.708 --> 06:47.208
I didn't know you miss me so much.

06:47.875 --> 06:50.000
Aren't you really excited to see me?

06:50.333 --> 06:51.542
What are you doing here?

06:53.292 --> 06:54.500
Get to the point.

06:54.583 --> 06:56.000
I don't have time for bullshit.

06:57.125 --> 06:58.583
Go Nicolas Town.

06:58.667 --> 06:59.875
Ever heard of it?

06:59.958 --> 07:00.917
It's in the downtown area.

07:01.000 --> 07:01.833
Luxurious condos.

07:01.917 --> 07:03.792
Private elevator.
Great lighting and air circulation.

07:03.917 --> 07:05.958
Did selling houses make you stupid?

07:06.417 --> 07:09.333
What on earth makes you think
that I could afford a house?

07:10.333 --> 07:12.750
I have a suite that's worth 12 million.

07:12.833 --> 07:14.542
The homeowner is badly in need of money.

07:14.625 --> 07:15.792
He'll sell it for six million.

07:15.875 --> 07:17.917
I haven't told anyone else.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.042
Not even my boss.

07:19.417 --> 07:20.958
But my client wants to be paid in full.

07:21.042 --> 07:23.417
I mortgaged my apartment
and got over two million.

07:24.083 --> 07:25.708
I still need about three million more.

07:27.750 --> 07:28.958
Regarding your apartment,

07:29.042 --> 07:30.208
who owns it?

07:30.375 --> 07:31.583
Don't even think about it.

07:32.042 --> 07:33.208
No way in hell.

07:33.667 --> 07:35.208
It's been years since my dad passed away.

07:35.292 --> 07:36.917
This apartment
is the only thing he left us.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.125
How can I sell it?

07:38.375 --> 07:39.750
It's not selling.

07:39.833 --> 07:40.750
You mortgage it.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.500
Same thing to me.

07:42.750 --> 07:45.833
If my mom wakes up and finds out
that I sold the apartment,

07:45.917 --> 07:47.125
she's going to kick my ass.

07:48.417 --> 07:50.167
Your mom has been in a coma for years.

07:50.583 --> 07:51.542
She's not going to wake up.

07:53.833 --> 07:55.375
What's your problem?

07:56.667 --> 07:58.500
We'll make six million on this deal.

07:59.125 --> 08:00.500
It's a really good deal.

08:00.875 --> 08:02.208
Why did I tell you?

08:02.333 --> 08:04.208
I'm looking out for you, buddy.

08:04.750 --> 08:06.625
You've been taking care
of a vegetable for many years.

08:06.708 --> 08:08.000
Medical bills.

08:08.125 --> 08:10.542
-Nursing fees.
-Stop worrying about my mom.

08:10.833 --> 08:12.500
Insurance covers half,

08:12.750 --> 08:14.458
and Liu Qing helps me with nursing.

08:14.917 --> 08:16.958
You have to think about Liu Qing.

08:17.375 --> 08:19.000
You don't even have money to marry her.

08:19.958 --> 08:21.250
Let me tell you one more time.

08:21.667 --> 08:22.875
We are not dating.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.042
Then what are you guys?

08:24.542 --> 08:25.458
We are friends,

08:26.042 --> 08:26.917
classmates,

08:27.625 --> 08:28.542
old neighbors.

08:30.875 --> 08:32.250
Then why do you keep her photo?

08:33.542 --> 08:36.833
You think you're too poor
and don't want to drag her down.

08:40.542 --> 08:42.292
Please go figure out your own life

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
before coming here and talking about mine.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.083
Ms. Liu, how are you feeling?

09:42.167 --> 09:43.125
Much better.

09:48.417 --> 09:49.667
You jerk.

09:59.875 --> 10:00.917
Out of money again?

10:05.542 --> 10:06.375
One thousand.

10:06.542 --> 10:08.250
Didn't you just get paid on the third?

10:10.500 --> 10:11.833
I was late for work a couple of times.

10:12.208 --> 10:13.083
My pay was deducted.

10:13.333 --> 10:14.833
Can you act like an adult?

10:15.042 --> 10:15.917
Yes, I can.

10:16.958 --> 10:18.042
Would you lend me some money?

10:18.208 --> 10:21.333
The head nurse says if we don't pay up,
Mom will be sleeping in the hallway.

10:21.500 --> 10:22.833
Won't you feel sad

10:23.583 --> 10:24.708
if our mom is in the hallway?

10:25.000 --> 10:26.417
Don't call her our mom all the time.

10:26.667 --> 10:28.250
I'm not your wife.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.083
Zheng Kai-si.

10:37.375 --> 10:39.042
I have six patients
waiting for drip infusion.

10:39.792 --> 10:40.958
If you want to act like a jerk,

10:41.042 --> 10:42.375
please do it at another time.

10:46.333 --> 10:47.792
<i>Is Liu Qing there?</i>

10:47.958 --> 10:48.833
Yes, I'm here.

10:49.042 --> 10:51.250
<i>I need a Glycerine Enema.</i>

10:53.000 --> 10:54.792
Okay. Please wait for a second.

10:55.333 --> 10:56.333
Disgusting.

10:57.833 --> 10:58.958
Take off your pants.

10:59.125 --> 11:00.667
You help me.

11:05.875 --> 11:07.083
Do you need it or not?

11:07.167 --> 11:08.083
Of course.

11:08.292 --> 11:09.250
Hurry up.

11:09.333 --> 11:10.875
You hurry up.

11:12.042 --> 11:13.125
Stop laughing.

11:15.250 --> 11:16.167
Come out here.

11:17.833 --> 11:18.917
What are you doing?

11:19.750 --> 11:21.958
-Can't you see he's messing with you?
-I know, so what?

11:22.042 --> 11:23.000
This is my job.

11:23.167 --> 11:24.250
Then you should quit.

11:25.833 --> 11:26.833
Quit?

11:27.083 --> 11:28.250
Are you going to provide for me?

11:30.500 --> 11:31.333
Qing.

11:32.250 --> 11:33.125
Nurse.

11:34.292 --> 11:35.208
Qing.

11:36.625 --> 11:37.917
I'm waiting for you.

11:43.917 --> 11:45.542
Be gentle.

11:51.083 --> 11:52.000
Stop hitting him!

11:53.000 --> 11:53.958
Stop hitting him!

11:55.292 --> 11:56.167
Stop hitting him!

11:56.333 --> 11:57.250
-Li.
-Stop hitting him.

11:57.333 --> 11:58.750
Li. What's wrong, Li?

11:58.833 --> 12:01.167
Stop fighting. See, you've frightened Li.

12:01.625 --> 12:02.958
What's wrong with him?

12:03.042 --> 12:04.000
Li.

12:11.875 --> 12:12.792
Okay.

12:37.500 --> 12:38.625
Where is the head nurse?

12:39.500 --> 12:40.417
In her office.

12:40.875 --> 12:42.833
Would you stay away from Kai-si?

12:43.167 --> 12:44.583
He always gets into trouble.

12:44.958 --> 12:46.375
Why don't you keep that in mind?

12:47.292 --> 12:49.333
Your dad went to great lengths

12:49.417 --> 12:50.708
to get you transferred here.

12:50.875 --> 12:52.792
It's not worth it if you get demoted

12:53.000 --> 12:54.167
because of him.

12:54.625 --> 12:55.583
Ms. Chen.

12:55.792 --> 12:56.875
Don't say that.

12:56.958 --> 12:58.125
He wouldn't become this way

12:58.208 --> 12:59.958
if not for his mom.

13:00.042 --> 13:01.583
He was the smartest kid
in our neighborhood.

13:01.667 --> 13:02.958
Are you still defending him?

13:04.625 --> 13:07.667
Anyway, don't blame Zheng Kai-si for it.

13:08.833 --> 13:10.375
You can deduct from my salary

13:10.500 --> 13:11.958
if anyone asks for compensation.

13:12.250 --> 13:14.542
What if Mr. Li didn't make it today?

13:15.417 --> 13:16.833
Can you take the blame?

13:20.375 --> 13:22.250
Dr. Ma came back from France

13:22.875 --> 13:23.917
and brought you a bag.

13:24.458 --> 13:26.458
Get it from my locker after your shift.

13:27.125 --> 13:28.375
You keep it.

13:28.792 --> 13:31.292
Listen, he bought it in France for you.

13:31.375 --> 13:32.667
Why would I keep it?

13:34.083 --> 13:36.250
Text him later

13:36.583 --> 13:37.708
and thank him.

13:37.792 --> 13:39.000
Get to know each other.

13:53.875 --> 13:54.875
Take this.

13:58.958 --> 14:00.000
I'm not hungry.

14:00.167 --> 14:01.292
I'll have some noodles.

14:01.958 --> 14:02.958
Take it.

14:03.583 --> 14:05.083
I just microwaved it.

14:05.250 --> 14:06.250
It's getting cold.

14:10.042 --> 14:11.958
I have to hand in my salaries
to my dad now.

14:13.375 --> 14:14.500
This is all I have.

14:14.792 --> 14:15.833
Take it.

14:18.458 --> 14:19.292
I don't need it.

14:20.083 --> 14:21.417
I'll figure out tomorrow.

14:32.375 --> 14:34.917
There was a mass food poisoning today.

14:35.500 --> 14:38.042
Some are in a critical state.

14:38.417 --> 14:40.000
That's why your mom is in the hallway.

14:40.250 --> 14:41.500
But Ms. Chen said

14:41.583 --> 14:42.667
that it's only temporary.

14:44.542 --> 14:45.417
Liu Qing.

14:48.167 --> 14:49.583
If you meet someone right for you,

14:50.875 --> 14:52.083
just marry him.

15:00.292 --> 15:01.458
I found him long ago.

15:05.875 --> 15:07.625
But he won't marry me.

15:54.083 --> 15:54.917
Mom.

15:56.875 --> 15:59.292
Is there an end to this?

16:01.583 --> 16:03.042
You are always the tough one.

16:04.708 --> 16:07.708
Now that you're lying here,
how can you take it any longer?

16:10.250 --> 16:12.417
Mom, ask your colleagues and friends

16:12.542 --> 16:14.417
what your son has become.

16:16.417 --> 16:18.708
He can't even afford your medical bill.

16:34.083 --> 16:35.167
I'm sorry, Mom.

16:50.875 --> 16:53.375

16:59.458 --> 17:00.958
It's under my mom's name.

17:02.625 --> 17:03.667
Can it be mortgaged?

17:09.333 --> 17:10.208
All done.

17:11.292 --> 17:12.458
Give me the deed.

17:17.208 --> 17:18.625
I'll have another look at the contract.

17:18.833 --> 17:20.333
It's all in English.

17:20.417 --> 17:21.458
Do you speak English?

17:21.833 --> 17:23.042
Don't worry.

17:23.208 --> 17:25.042
My lawyer has made sure that it's good.

17:32.208 --> 17:33.125
Perfect.

Big Shrimp.

17:36.042 --> 17:37.375
If you mess this up,

17:39.000 --> 17:40.125
I'll beat you up.

17:40.417 --> 17:41.875
If I mess this up,

17:42.625 --> 17:43.792
my dad will kill me

17:44.208 --> 17:45.708
in no time.

18:35.417 --> 18:36.458
A pack of cigarettes.

19:14.542 --> 19:15.667
Look at this.

19:16.750 --> 19:18.667
I handmade these.

19:18.917 --> 19:19.958
Please take one.

19:20.042 --> 19:21.625
-No, thanks.
-It's two yuan each.

19:21.708 --> 19:22.875
-No.
-What do you think?

19:23.333 --> 19:24.500
It's pretty.

19:28.125 --> 19:29.083
Have a look.

19:29.208 --> 19:31.167
I handmade these.

19:31.250 --> 19:32.542
It's two yuan each.

19:32.625 --> 19:34.167
And five yuan for three.

19:36.167 --> 19:37.750
-Please wait for your change.
-Keep it.

<i>Sorry. The subscriber you dialed
is unavailable. Please dial again later.</i>

20:15.375 --> 20:17.083
LI JUN

20:26.083 --> 20:27.292
<i>I'm so sorry, buddy.</i>

20:27.375 --> 20:29.042
<i>I'll do anything to make it up</i>

20:29.125 --> 20:30.125
<i>if I have the chance.</i>

20:33.083 --> 20:34.250
<i>I'm so sorry, buddy.</i>

20:34.333 --> 20:36.042
<i>I'll do anything to make it up</i>

20:36.125 --> 20:37.042
<i>if I have the chance.</i>

21:24.125 --> 21:26.250
<i>What's your relationship with Li Jun?</i>

21:27.125 --> 21:28.000
<i>We are friends.</i>

21:30.417 --> 21:31.542
Here's the thing.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.250
He was fired

21:33.583 --> 21:35.167
two months ago.

21:36.667 --> 21:38.333
He stole the seal from finance,

21:38.417 --> 21:40.292
conned a client's down payment,

21:40.375 --> 21:41.583
then he vanished.

21:42.125 --> 21:43.250
Our company--

21:44.000 --> 21:45.917
UNKNOWN

21:48.208 --> 21:49.083
Hello?

21:49.167 --> 21:50.875
<i>You are in the wrong place.</i>

21:51.917 --> 21:52.958
Who is this?

21:53.625 --> 21:54.667
<i>Get up.</i>

21:54.875 --> 21:56.958
<i>And go to the window on your left.</i>

23:15.917 --> 23:16.792
What?

24:19.458 --> 24:20.625
I want to talk to Li Jun.

24:22.250 --> 24:24.000
Then why should I believe you?

24:33.667 --> 24:34.875
<i>I'm so sorry, buddy.</i>

24:34.958 --> 24:36.667
<i>I'll do anything to make it up</i>

24:36.792 --> 24:37.875
<i>if I have the chance.</i>

25:59.333 --> 26:00.500
What kind of game is it?

26:17.125 --> 26:18.708
What's the worst-case scenario?

26:32.000 --> 26:33.708
<i>Are you going to provide for me?</i>

26:36.542 --> 26:38.083
<i>I found him long ago.</i>

26:59.542 --> 27:00.917
ZHENG KAI-SI

27:16.750 --> 27:17.833
I'm going on a business trip.

27:17.917 --> 27:19.500
Please take care of my mom.

27:20.083 --> 27:21.750
This is my mom's medical history.
Bankcard and--

27:21.833 --> 27:23.125
What do you need your passport for?

27:27.000 --> 27:28.417
I told you I'm going on a business trip.

27:28.625 --> 27:29.792
Don't lie to me.

27:30.250 --> 27:31.583
That arcade you work for,

27:31.667 --> 27:33.500
what business takes you overseas?

27:35.250 --> 27:36.708
What kind of trouble did you get into?

27:39.542 --> 27:40.500
Are you trying to flee?

27:45.208 --> 27:47.083
I saw Li Jun the other day.

27:47.958 --> 27:49.917
Who was that man in black?

27:50.708 --> 27:51.792
Is he a mafia?

27:53.542 --> 27:54.667
Why are you laughing?

28:05.667 --> 28:06.708
This is for you.

28:07.458 --> 28:08.750
It's cheap, but it's all I have.

28:13.500 --> 28:14.833
I'm leaving my mom to you.

28:17.083 --> 28:19.042
If I don't come back in a week,

28:20.417 --> 28:21.667
unhook her from the respirator.

28:22.167 --> 28:23.167
Zheng Kai-si.

28:24.750 --> 28:26.917
Can you stay?

28:27.417 --> 28:29.000
If you need money,

28:29.500 --> 28:30.958
I'll see what I can do.

28:36.333 --> 28:37.375
One week.

28:39.833 --> 28:41.000
If I come back,

28:43.417 --> 28:45.000
I will never leave you again.

28:48.250 --> 28:49.583
If I don't come back,

28:51.375 --> 28:52.542
don't waste your time on me.

28:53.542 --> 28:54.500
Just move on.

28:54.583 --> 28:55.917
I can't move on.

28:56.917 --> 28:58.417
If you're leaving,

28:58.917 --> 29:00.917
then I'll wait for you

29:01.375 --> 29:02.458
until the day I die.

29:06.500 --> 29:08.125
Liu Qing!

29:08.208 --> 29:10.167
-There's an emergency at bed 16!
-I'm coming!

29:10.500 --> 29:11.542
Hurry up!

29:12.000 --> 29:13.042
Don't leave.

29:13.542 --> 29:15.708
Stay here. We're not done.

29:16.292 --> 29:17.167
Don't leave.

29:45.083 --> 29:47.542
<i>Leave everything else to us.</i>

29:48.333 --> 29:50.083
<i>Just sleep.</i>

29:50.375 --> 29:51.708
<i>When you wake up,</i>

29:51.875 --> 29:54.292
<i>you will be where you need to be.</i>

29:59.208 --> 30:02.333
<i>This is an anesthetic we developed.</i>

30:03.250 --> 30:05.792
It will help you sleep better.

40:32.208 --> 40:33.958
No!

40:34.708 --> 40:38.167
No! Leave me alone!

40:38.250 --> 40:42.000
Stop hitting me! I don't want to die!

40:42.125 --> 40:43.792
Leave me alone!

41:00.667 --> 41:01.833
Chinese, right?

41:05.417 --> 41:06.792
I'm Zhang Jing-kun.

41:09.750 --> 41:11.333
Zheng Kai-si.

41:12.542 --> 41:14.417
Do you know why there are so many cameras?

41:16.583 --> 41:18.625
We are here playing rock, scissors, paper.

41:18.833 --> 41:20.375
Meanwhile, a lot of rich guys are upstairs

41:20.500 --> 41:23.375
watching the live feed and betting on us.

41:23.792 --> 41:24.875
Think about it.

41:25.333 --> 41:28.375
<i>They got us here from all over the world.</i>

41:28.625 --> 41:30.458
<i>It must've cost a fortune to fly us here.</i>

41:31.500 --> 41:32.708
<i>Guess how they make profit?</i>

41:32.792 --> 41:34.000
<i>They need those rich guys.</i>

41:34.792 --> 41:36.542
<i>This is not the first time I'm here.</i>

41:37.083 --> 41:38.542
And I'm telling you,

41:38.625 --> 41:40.708
many of the players are not rookies.

41:41.667 --> 41:43.833
Everyone has his own purpose to be here.

41:44.750 --> 41:46.750
Mine is to get my loan cleared

41:46.833 --> 41:48.292
and leave the ship in one piece.

41:48.792 --> 41:50.292
This is far out of our depth.

41:50.458 --> 41:51.958
We should get out as soon as possible.

41:53.125 --> 41:54.375
Who doesn't want to get out?

41:55.083 --> 41:56.958
I can leave if I give you all my cards.

41:57.417 --> 41:58.500
Would you take them?

42:00.333 --> 42:02.958
Don't forget it's a tie
if we choose the same card.

42:08.750 --> 42:10.042
By this rule,

42:10.125 --> 42:11.750
if we find the right partner,

42:11.833 --> 42:13.750
we can get off the ship alive for sure.

42:15.333 --> 42:17.833
Unfortunately, most people are greedy.

42:18.750 --> 42:19.875
It's human nature.

42:22.208 --> 42:24.250
Get the cards in the same order as mine.

42:24.375 --> 42:26.250
Scissors, rock and paper.
Divide into four groups.

42:27.667 --> 42:29.750
If you make up your mind,
meet me at Table Six.

42:29.917 --> 42:31.417
Play cards in this order.

42:31.542 --> 42:33.917
Twelve draws.
We will get it done in three minutes.

42:50.208 --> 42:54.667
ALL PREJUDICES COME FROM THE GUTS

44:29.667 --> 44:30.875
Sorry, buddy.

44:30.958 --> 44:33.333
I accidentally messed up the order.

44:34.667 --> 44:35.750
Don't worry.

44:36.500 --> 44:39.042
Next round, you play rock
and I'll play scissors.

44:39.667 --> 44:41.125
You'll get the star back.

44:41.958 --> 44:42.792
Come on.

45:27.917 --> 45:29.125
You are cheating.

45:29.375 --> 45:30.875
He cheated. Referee, he cheated!

45:31.125 --> 45:32.042
Referee, he...

45:40.917 --> 45:42.917
When that white guy explained the rules,

45:43.000 --> 45:44.500
did he say anything about no cheating?

45:46.917 --> 45:48.000
Relax.

45:48.583 --> 45:51.708
You can buy the stars back
when the game is over.

45:53.958 --> 45:55.500
Just get your money ready.

46:08.667 --> 46:09.500
No.

46:10.250 --> 46:11.958
You Westerner, are you even human?

46:13.625 --> 46:14.833
I can't accept this.

46:15.750 --> 46:17.875
I'm a human.

46:18.125 --> 46:19.958
I won't let you butcher me.

46:38.500 --> 46:40.000
My money!

48:04.458 --> 48:07.417
<i>Zheng Kai-si.</i>

48:14.458 --> 48:18.333
<i>Zheng Kai-si.</i>

48:19.333 --> 48:23.000
<i>Zheng Kai-si.</i>

48:23.083 --> 48:25.042
<i>Zheng Kai-si.</i>

48:27.208 --> 48:28.417
Zheng Kai-si.

48:29.500 --> 48:30.583
Zheng Kai-si.

48:32.417 --> 48:33.500
Li Jun.

48:38.833 --> 48:39.917
Why are you here?

48:40.875 --> 48:42.250
Where else should I be?

48:43.958 --> 48:45.750
You should go to hell.

48:46.917 --> 48:47.833
You are a liar!

48:48.083 --> 48:48.958
You're a big liar!

48:49.083 --> 48:50.458
Give my deed back.

49:07.250 --> 49:08.792
You have me as your guarantor.

49:09.375 --> 49:10.542
Why did you end up here?

49:11.708 --> 49:13.583
I want to try my luck.

49:13.917 --> 49:15.083
If I'm lucky,

49:15.167 --> 49:17.333
I will win back your apartment.

49:19.250 --> 49:21.375
If I knew what you drag me into,

49:21.625 --> 49:24.417
I should've pushed you off my balcony

49:25.208 --> 49:26.083
and let you die.

49:26.208 --> 49:27.708
I won't complain if you kill me.

49:28.667 --> 49:30.417
But I won't die without a fight

49:30.625 --> 49:31.750
if they try to kill me.

49:32.875 --> 49:34.250
I don't think they dare to kill us.

49:35.125 --> 49:36.042
Come one, buddy.

49:36.125 --> 49:37.417
We are in international waters now.

49:37.708 --> 49:40.000
If they toss our bodies off the ship,
no one will know.

49:40.083 --> 49:41.667
Who will pay back the money
if they kill us?

49:42.000 --> 49:42.833
Are they idiots?

49:43.458 --> 49:44.875
See that mirror over there?

49:46.917 --> 49:48.875
All the eliminated are locked behind it.

49:49.000 --> 49:50.833
They call it the black room.

49:51.208 --> 49:54.625
Everyone inside it
will have a chance to get out

49:54.792 --> 49:56.792
during the last ten minutes.

49:56.875 --> 49:58.167
If no one gets you out,

49:58.375 --> 50:00.625
you'll be taken to the bottom of the ship.

50:00.792 --> 50:02.500
There's a medical lab.

50:02.833 --> 50:04.917
And we'll pay the debt as lab rats.

50:05.167 --> 50:06.208
Who told you that?

50:06.500 --> 50:08.125
One of the guys in my cage.

50:08.208 --> 50:09.667
He's been here three times.

50:11.458 --> 50:13.125
How did you know them?

50:15.458 --> 50:18.458
I went to Macau on a company trip.

50:19.917 --> 50:21.417
I lost everything in the casino.

50:21.833 --> 50:23.292
They came to me

50:23.375 --> 50:25.208
and lent me a loan without collaterals.

50:25.833 --> 50:28.458
But the interest was calculated daily.

50:29.000 --> 50:32.917
There was no other way,
but selling my dad's apartment.

50:33.792 --> 50:35.458
But I couldn't resign myself to it.

50:37.375 --> 50:41.000
So, I took a client's down payment
and went to Macau again.

50:42.042 --> 50:43.667
I lost everything.

50:44.417 --> 50:46.292
So, you decided to con me?

50:47.458 --> 50:49.292
I thought it had to be

50:50.875 --> 50:52.500
my turn to win.

50:52.958 --> 50:54.208
Where does your dad live now?

50:58.292 --> 50:59.333
At a nursing home.

51:35.667 --> 51:37.042
We have less than two hours.

51:37.292 --> 51:39.333
We're not going to die here.

51:40.583 --> 51:42.167
We each have one star left.

51:45.542 --> 51:46.792
We can't keep going like this.

51:48.875 --> 51:50.333
There's no room for error.

51:51.208 --> 51:52.333
We need to find someone

51:53.167 --> 51:54.542
who possesses two stars

51:55.208 --> 51:57.375
with no card.

51:57.917 --> 52:01.292
We'll use one of his two stars
as a backup.

52:04.500 --> 52:05.583
I saw one.

52:13.875 --> 52:14.833
No way.

52:16.208 --> 52:18.583
What if you trick me?

52:19.000 --> 52:20.625
You don't have any cards left.

52:20.875 --> 52:23.708
You have a better chance with us
rather than doing nothing.

52:24.042 --> 52:27.625
I have no cards left,
but I can buy stars afterward.

52:29.750 --> 52:31.000
Those people,

52:31.083 --> 52:32.750
all of them have the same plan.

52:32.833 --> 52:34.375
Are you sure you'll have enough money?

52:34.792 --> 52:35.917
Okay, then.

52:36.333 --> 52:39.292
Show me all of your cards.

52:55.750 --> 52:56.875
I'll trust you this time.

53:26.833 --> 53:27.917
I'll trust you this time.

53:30.250 --> 53:31.125
Shit.

54:01.667 --> 54:02.917
Thanks for your star.

54:13.375 --> 54:14.583
You lied to us.

54:14.708 --> 54:16.250
Stop crying!

54:16.333 --> 54:19.333
You thief!

54:27.792 --> 54:29.208
Damn it.

54:37.917 --> 54:38.833
Sir.

54:39.792 --> 54:40.750
I'm begging you.

54:41.167 --> 54:43.208
Please don't leave me here.

54:44.083 --> 54:45.000
I...

54:45.333 --> 54:47.042
I only have one star now.

54:47.625 --> 54:48.917
I don't want to be a slave.

54:49.292 --> 54:50.250
Slave?

54:50.958 --> 54:52.792
If you lose, you are going to die.

54:53.500 --> 54:54.500
No way.

54:55.333 --> 54:56.542
I need to go home.

54:56.875 --> 54:58.292
I have to get off this ship.

54:58.417 --> 54:59.333
My daughter.

54:59.417 --> 55:01.083
She's waiting for me at home.

55:02.042 --> 55:04.958
See, this is my daughter.

55:05.042 --> 55:06.833
Please.

55:10.333 --> 55:12.458
Who's looking after her now?

55:13.000 --> 55:14.000
My mom.

55:14.958 --> 55:16.458
My mom has cataracts in both eyes.

55:16.875 --> 55:18.708
She is almost blind. She can't even cook.

55:18.792 --> 55:19.917
What's your name?

55:22.208 --> 55:23.458
Meng Guo-xiang.

55:23.917 --> 55:25.708
You can call me Fatty Meng.

55:26.167 --> 55:27.292
Kai-si.

55:28.667 --> 55:29.875
Don't soften up.

55:29.958 --> 55:32.167
He just stole our card.
You're not going to believe him, right?

55:32.250 --> 55:33.167
Buddy.

55:33.583 --> 55:36.542
I didn't mean to steal your card.

55:37.250 --> 55:39.125
I got tricked too many times.

55:40.333 --> 55:43.458
Besides, you got four scissors
and one paper.

55:43.875 --> 55:46.417
Anyone would be suspicious.

55:46.542 --> 55:47.458
Why?

55:47.708 --> 55:49.250
It doesn't make sense.

55:50.333 --> 55:55.167
Normally people would keep
each type of cards balanced.

55:55.792 --> 55:58.583
But you have almost all scissors.

55:59.125 --> 56:00.583
What if someone saw it?

56:01.125 --> 56:02.500
You'd become the targets.

56:03.333 --> 56:04.708
He has a point.

56:05.083 --> 56:08.792
-If you tell anyone, you're dead...
-Shh!

56:18.833 --> 56:20.375
<i>Everyone has 12 cards.</i>

56:21.125 --> 56:23.292
<i>One scissors, one rock
and one paper in a group,</i>

56:23.750 --> 56:25.208
<i>divided into four groups.</i>

56:26.083 --> 56:29.083
<i>Assuming that he plays his cards balanced,</i>

56:29.750 --> 56:32.292
<i>no matter in what order
he plays out his first three cards,</i>

56:32.958 --> 56:37.292
<i>he'll play out one card for each type.</i>

56:37.625 --> 56:38.667
<i>If next round</i>

56:38.875 --> 56:40.708
<i>he plays scissors and rock,</i>

56:40.792 --> 56:43.542
<i>and hopes to keep his cards balanced,</i>

56:43.750 --> 56:44.875
<i>for round three...</i>

56:45.042 --> 56:46.500
<i>He'll surely play paper.</i>

56:46.958 --> 56:48.250
<i>Not exactly.</i>

56:49.458 --> 56:52.208
If someone plays paper, scissors, paper,
for his first three cards,

56:52.292 --> 56:54.500
and rock, scissors, rock, for next,

56:54.708 --> 56:56.583
his cards still remain balanced.

56:58.000 --> 57:00.042
Buddy, you have a weird logic.

57:01.000 --> 57:02.958
If he plays the way as you said,

57:03.792 --> 57:06.542
when he has three cards remaining,
he'll only have two types of cards.

57:08.167 --> 57:09.000
Yes.

57:09.167 --> 57:10.417
You lost me, but keep going.

57:10.542 --> 57:12.792
I copied all your Math papers anyway.

57:20.583 --> 57:23.500
<i>You guys go find someone
with nine cards left.</i>

57:23.625 --> 57:24.625
<i>Keep an eye on him.</i>

57:24.708 --> 57:27.125
<i>If he plays rock and scissors
in the next two rounds,</i>

57:27.208 --> 57:28.208
<i>tell me immediately.</i>

57:28.958 --> 57:30.375
<i>The order doesn't matter.</i>

57:30.875 --> 57:31.917
<i>Go and find this guy.</i>

57:32.000 --> 57:33.083
<i>I'll go get a loan</i>

57:33.458 --> 57:35.333
<i>and see if we can buy a star
as our backup.</i>

57:37.750 --> 57:38.750
I need 500,000.

57:49.875 --> 57:51.208
This much?

57:52.000 --> 57:53.292
We need to be prepared.

57:54.458 --> 57:55.583
We found the guy.

57:55.958 --> 57:57.250
Fatty Meng is tailing him.

57:59.750 --> 58:00.583
Which one?

58:02.333 --> 58:03.958
That guy with a beard over there.

58:10.333 --> 58:11.458
No time to buy another star.

58:12.083 --> 58:13.208
We have to try our luck.

58:17.000 --> 58:18.250
I'm telling you, Fatty,

58:18.417 --> 58:20.625
we share this loan equally.

58:21.292 --> 58:22.375
Okay.

58:27.208 --> 58:28.167
Do you want to play?

58:34.500 --> 58:35.708
Why not?

59:12.875 --> 59:14.250
Yes, we got him!

59:25.875 --> 59:26.958
Wait.

59:28.583 --> 59:30.375
Are you sure we're going to hell?

59:31.792 --> 59:33.000
Dare to go for another round?

59:33.083 --> 59:34.667
-Are you insane?
-Stay out of it.

59:35.500 --> 59:36.375
Are you game?

59:57.083 --> 59:58.667
Kai-si, we don't have to play with him.

59:58.750 --> 1:00:01.292
We can find other players with nine cards.

1:00:01.958 --> 1:00:04.875
That's right, we should stop.

1:00:08.000 --> 1:00:09.000
I accept.

1:00:42.042 --> 1:00:43.958
This won't end well for us.

1:00:44.667 --> 1:00:46.500
If we lose in the next two rounds,

1:00:46.708 --> 1:00:48.917
two of us will end up in the black room.

1:00:49.292 --> 1:00:51.125
Can't you tell I'm putting on an act?

1:00:55.750 --> 1:00:56.833
Think about it.

1:00:57.750 --> 1:01:00.625
<i>Why would he suddenly want to play
three consecutive rounds</i>

1:01:00.917 --> 1:01:04.625
<i>without me changing cards
when he saw I have three cards left?</i>

1:01:05.917 --> 1:01:06.958
<i>I guess...</i>

1:01:08.958 --> 1:01:09.792
<i>No.</i>

1:01:10.417 --> 1:01:12.333
<i>After the first win,</i>

1:01:12.875 --> 1:01:16.000
<i>I'm sure he's using the balance mind.</i>

1:01:16.583 --> 1:01:17.792
<i>This conventional thinking</i>

1:01:18.167 --> 1:01:20.542
<i>makes him believe
that the three cards in my hand</i>

1:01:20.667 --> 1:01:21.958
<i>must be balanced too,</i>

1:01:22.792 --> 1:01:26.542
<i>which are scissors, rock, and paper.</i>

1:01:28.958 --> 1:01:30.958
<i>Just now I played out scissors.</i>

1:01:31.292 --> 1:01:32.667
<i>So, he believes </i>

1:01:32.875 --> 1:01:34.208
<i>that the remaining cards</i>

1:01:34.458 --> 1:01:36.667
<i>are one rock and one paper.</i>

1:01:37.708 --> 1:01:39.583
<i>As long as he plays paper twice,</i>

1:01:39.750 --> 1:01:41.583
<i>he'll win at least one star.</i>

1:01:42.292 --> 1:01:44.667
<i>That's why he wants to play
with me three times.</i>

1:01:45.167 --> 1:01:47.000
<i>But he could never imagine</i>

1:01:47.250 --> 1:01:48.792
<i>that the cards we have</i>

1:01:49.875 --> 1:01:51.500
<i>are all scissors.</i>

1:01:54.833 --> 1:01:56.500
Whether you get it or not,

1:01:56.625 --> 1:01:59.292
don't nod or show
any expression on your face.

1:01:59.667 --> 1:02:00.667
And

1:02:02.542 --> 1:02:03.833
shut your mouth.

1:02:39.292 --> 1:02:40.500
Surprise.

1:04:44.167 --> 1:04:45.500
We are doomed.

1:04:45.583 --> 1:04:47.083
They really dare kill people.

1:04:48.333 --> 1:04:50.000
If we lose, we are going to die.

1:04:50.750 --> 1:04:52.708
-What are we going to do?
-Stop it.

1:04:52.792 --> 1:04:54.208
You are talking too much.

1:04:55.042 --> 1:04:55.875
Kai-si.

1:04:56.333 --> 1:04:58.333
There are fewer cards every minute.

1:04:58.417 --> 1:05:00.625
It's now or never.

1:05:00.708 --> 1:05:01.583
No.

1:05:03.250 --> 1:05:04.208
I think

1:05:04.792 --> 1:05:06.958
we should save the money
for stars in the end.

1:05:07.083 --> 1:05:09.583
We need four more stars to survive,

1:05:09.667 --> 1:05:11.792
but each person has an average
of less than three stars now.

1:05:12.042 --> 1:05:14.125
But if you buy cards with the money,

1:05:14.750 --> 1:05:17.375
which kind of cards
will guarantee our survival?

1:05:17.667 --> 1:05:18.750
Rocks.

1:05:23.750 --> 1:05:24.583
Look at it.

1:05:25.875 --> 1:05:27.417
<i>Paper has the least left,</i>

1:05:27.917 --> 1:05:29.083
<i>scissors are the most.</i>

1:05:29.792 --> 1:05:31.208
<i>Think of it this way.</i>

1:05:32.417 --> 1:05:34.208
<i>When the game begins,</i>

1:05:34.667 --> 1:05:36.375
<i>all types of cards begin decreasing.</i>

1:05:36.875 --> 1:05:39.000
<i>They are like three lit fuses.</i>

1:05:40.000 --> 1:05:41.292
<i>Three hours later,</i>

1:05:41.417 --> 1:05:43.042
<i>the ratio of the cards looks like this.</i>

1:05:44.167 --> 1:05:46.042
<i>If the cards decrease in the same speed,</i>

1:05:46.167 --> 1:05:48.417
<i>in the time remaining,</i>

1:05:48.750 --> 1:05:51.208
<i>papers will be the first to run out.</i>

1:05:54.208 --> 1:05:55.917
In this situation,

1:05:56.667 --> 1:05:58.750
if we only have rocks,

1:05:59.542 --> 1:06:01.375
<i>we could never lose.</i>

1:06:02.542 --> 1:06:03.583
<i>That's right.</i>

1:06:03.792 --> 1:06:06.792
<i>We have the chance to win much more,
let alone four stars.</i>

1:06:11.958 --> 1:06:13.625
We can't do it by ourselves.

1:06:13.917 --> 1:06:16.292
No one will play with us if they find out.

1:06:17.375 --> 1:06:19.042
<i>We need to find players with three stars.</i>

1:06:19.542 --> 1:06:21.292
<i>Ask them to buy rocks for us.</i>

1:06:21.417 --> 1:06:22.333
<i>In return,</i>

1:06:22.500 --> 1:06:25.708
<i>we pay them and take
all their remaining cards.</i>

1:06:26.208 --> 1:06:28.292
<i>That way, they'll be safe
to go to the second floor.</i>

1:06:29.167 --> 1:06:30.500
<i>After they leave,</i>

1:06:30.667 --> 1:06:33.583
<i>no one here will know our plan
to stock up rocks.</i>

1:06:33.750 --> 1:06:35.333
<i>Hiring people to buy cards for us,</i>

1:06:35.542 --> 1:06:38.250
<i>is it against the rules?</i>

1:06:38.333 --> 1:06:39.458
<i>It has been hours,</i>

1:06:39.542 --> 1:06:42.000
<i>haven't you noticed
that there are no rules?</i>

1:06:42.625 --> 1:06:44.250
<i>The referee is even blind to cheating,</i>

1:06:44.625 --> 1:06:45.583
<i>right?</i>

1:06:46.250 --> 1:06:49.167
<i>The white guy only gave
terms of elimination.</i>

1:06:49.583 --> 1:06:52.000
<i>Anything not mentioned is allowed.</i>

1:06:52.500 --> 1:06:54.292
<i>As long as when the game is over,</i>

1:06:54.583 --> 1:06:58.667
<i>we each have at least three stars
and no card remaining in hand,</i>

1:06:58.750 --> 1:07:00.708
<i>then we'll get off the ship safely.</i>

1:07:36.708 --> 1:07:38.083
<i>Thirty rocks.</i>

1:07:38.292 --> 1:07:39.625
Two scissors.

1:07:40.292 --> 1:07:41.375
Four papers.

1:07:41.750 --> 1:07:43.708
Do we need more scissors and papers?

1:07:44.792 --> 1:07:46.208
Shall we buy more?

1:07:47.458 --> 1:07:48.375
No.

1:07:50.000 --> 1:07:51.042
It's perfect.

1:07:53.292 --> 1:07:54.542
What's wrong?

1:07:57.208 --> 1:07:58.625
Scottish Black Sheep.

1:07:59.667 --> 1:08:02.000
The last Math story my dad told me.

1:08:03.208 --> 1:08:04.417
What?

1:08:05.958 --> 1:08:07.500
His dad was our Math teacher.

1:08:08.708 --> 1:08:10.375
I've been thinking about it

1:08:11.167 --> 1:08:12.875
since we began buying cards.

1:08:13.458 --> 1:08:15.208
<i>What color is this Rubik's cube?</i>

1:08:15.292 --> 1:08:16.125
<i>Red.</i>

1:08:16.208 --> 1:08:19.958
<i>Three tourists went to Scotland together
and saw a black sheep.</i>

1:08:20.042 --> 1:08:23.208
<i>The first one said,
"All the sheep in Scotland are black."</i>

1:08:23.292 --> 1:08:26.833
<i>The second one said, "It only proves
black sheep exist in Scotland."</i>

1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:29.542
<i>The third one said,
"None of you are accurate."</i>

1:08:29.625 --> 1:08:33.083
<i>We should say right here right now,
from our point of view,</i>

1:08:33.167 --> 1:08:36.792
<i>that the sheep has one black side.</i>

1:08:37.583 --> 1:08:39.625
When we are so sure about something,

1:08:40.875 --> 1:08:42.875
we ignore the whole picture.

1:08:45.208 --> 1:08:46.542
That's how that dude

1:08:47.417 --> 1:08:48.875
lost to us earlier.

1:08:51.292 --> 1:08:53.208
He's all by himself.

1:08:53.292 --> 1:08:54.542
There are three of us.

1:08:54.958 --> 1:08:56.708
At least three different points of view.

1:08:57.208 --> 1:08:58.125
That's right.

1:08:58.208 --> 1:09:01.167
Three heads are better than one.

1:09:07.375 --> 1:09:08.292
Take it.

1:09:09.792 --> 1:09:11.042
You keep it.

1:09:12.458 --> 1:09:13.958
You have no objection, right, Fatty Meng?

1:09:17.083 --> 1:09:18.083
No objection.

1:09:24.208 --> 1:09:25.958
We have to trust each other

1:09:30.167 --> 1:09:31.542
if we want to survive.

1:09:35.583 --> 1:09:36.875
It's about time.

1:09:37.625 --> 1:09:39.375
<i>Fatty Meng, keep an eye on the card count.</i>

1:09:40.250 --> 1:09:41.792
<i>When there are only two papers left,</i>

1:09:41.917 --> 1:09:43.208
<i>it will be our cue.</i>

1:09:44.417 --> 1:09:45.667
<i>We have two stars</i>

1:09:46.542 --> 1:09:47.500
<i>as backup.</i>

1:10:21.167 --> 1:10:22.417
Every time I asked you

1:10:23.375 --> 1:10:25.875
what happened on your eighth birthday,

1:10:26.750 --> 1:10:28.208
you told me you forgot.

1:10:29.542 --> 1:10:30.917
All I can remember is

1:10:32.917 --> 1:10:34.583
Scottish Black Sheep.

1:10:35.208 --> 1:10:38.000
And scattered memories.

1:10:39.625 --> 1:10:40.833
There was someone whistling.

1:10:41.917 --> 1:10:43.000
Whistling?

1:10:44.792 --> 1:10:46.417
It terrifies me

1:10:48.333 --> 1:10:50.208
whenever I think about it.

1:11:20.333 --> 1:11:22.708
<i>I have fought the good fight.</i>

1:11:26.792 --> 1:11:29.625
<i>I have finished the race.</i>

1:11:29.708 --> 1:11:32.000
<i>I have kept the faith.</i>

1:11:32.208 --> 1:11:33.417
<i>Since then</i>

1:11:34.125 --> 1:11:35.458
<i>whenever I get emotional, I get crazy.</i>

1:11:35.917 --> 1:11:37.667
<i>I can't get the clown out of my head.</i>

1:11:41.292 --> 1:11:42.292
To be honest,

1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:45.000
I can't tell if my memory

1:11:45.167 --> 1:11:46.083
is real or not.

1:11:47.667 --> 1:11:48.542
So--

1:11:52.458 --> 1:11:54.667
Old man, we are running out of time.

1:11:55.083 --> 1:11:57.208
You still have so many cards left.

1:11:58.042 --> 1:12:00.417
You won't get out without my plan.

1:12:00.750 --> 1:12:02.625
You need money for your son, right?

1:12:02.708 --> 1:12:03.667
If you don't make it...

1:12:08.250 --> 1:12:10.333
-Let's go somewhere else.
-Okay.

1:12:10.417 --> 1:12:11.333
Come on.

1:12:21.792 --> 1:12:23.000
Something is wrong.

1:12:24.208 --> 1:12:25.792
You guys need to check it out.

1:12:29.083 --> 1:12:31.167
Papers haven't changed for a while.

1:12:31.250 --> 1:12:32.833
Only scissors are decreasing.

1:12:32.917 --> 1:12:34.667
It's not the same proportion.

1:12:34.750 --> 1:12:35.750
Did you see that?

1:12:36.083 --> 1:12:37.583
Scissors go down in pairs.

1:12:40.750 --> 1:12:42.417
<i>Scissors are dropping fast.</i>

1:12:42.625 --> 1:12:43.792
Too many tied games.

1:12:44.958 --> 1:12:47.833
Each draw takes two scissors.

1:12:48.958 --> 1:12:50.708
Why are there so many draws
all of a sudden?

1:13:02.542 --> 1:13:03.958
<i>According to our theory,</i>

1:13:04.375 --> 1:13:06.500
<i>paper should be
the first card type to run out.</i>

1:13:07.042 --> 1:13:08.292
<i>We stocked up rocks,</i>

1:13:08.958 --> 1:13:10.958
<i>so rocks don't decrease.</i>

1:13:12.167 --> 1:13:14.375
<i>The consumption of the other two cards
should not be affected.</i>

1:13:15.042 --> 1:13:17.667
<i>But now scissors are decreasing fast</i>

1:13:17.750 --> 1:13:19.458
<i>due to lots of draws.</i>

1:13:20.333 --> 1:13:22.417
<i>There is only one possibility.</i>

1:13:23.042 --> 1:13:23.917
<i>It could be</i>

1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:27.417
<i>that someone put out the paper fuse.</i>

1:13:33.500 --> 1:13:34.417
Damn.

1:13:37.375 --> 1:13:39.167
Someone stocked up the cards like we did.

1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:41.542
They want to buy out the remaining papers.

1:13:55.208 --> 1:13:57.667
Kai-si, what are we going to do?
We have to do something.

1:13:58.458 --> 1:14:00.000
There are only 46 scissors left.

1:14:00.375 --> 1:14:01.375
If we keep waiting,

1:14:01.458 --> 1:14:04.000
the rocks we have will be useless.

1:14:07.625 --> 1:14:08.708
We can't wait anymore.

1:14:10.917 --> 1:14:11.917
I have to play now.

1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:14.708
Me too.

1:14:21.708 --> 1:14:22.583
Okay.

1:14:22.833 --> 1:14:23.750
Check.

1:15:23.375 --> 1:15:24.333
Hey.

1:15:25.417 --> 1:15:26.333
What's up?

1:15:26.833 --> 1:15:27.750
I'm Luca.

1:15:28.500 --> 1:15:29.750
I need 500,000.

1:15:30.375 --> 1:15:31.500
Those two guys behind him

1:15:31.708 --> 1:15:33.583
are the ones who won our stars.

1:15:40.625 --> 1:15:41.792
It seems that

1:15:42.250 --> 1:15:43.500
we became prey.

1:16:01.833 --> 1:16:03.625
Can you sell us your extra stars?

1:16:13.417 --> 1:16:14.500
How much?

1:16:19.958 --> 1:16:20.958
So?

1:16:21.125 --> 1:16:22.125
How about this?

1:16:22.708 --> 1:16:24.000
We'll borrow more money,

1:16:24.333 --> 1:16:26.042
and you sell me your three extra stars?

1:16:43.625 --> 1:16:44.917
Sell three to me,

1:16:45.375 --> 1:16:46.792
then I'll play three rounds with you.

1:16:56.833 --> 1:16:58.042
Finished.

1:17:04.708 --> 1:17:05.583
Okay.

1:17:07.167 --> 1:17:08.083
One game

1:17:08.958 --> 1:17:10.042
for three stars.

1:17:11.417 --> 1:17:13.083
Is this damn translation machine
not working?

1:17:13.167 --> 1:17:15.583
I told you I won't sell you three stars.

1:17:15.792 --> 1:17:17.208
I never intended to buy your stars.

1:17:17.875 --> 1:17:20.792
What I want is to bet our three stars

1:17:21.042 --> 1:17:22.833
on your extra star.

1:17:23.292 --> 1:17:24.292
You are insane!

1:17:24.417 --> 1:17:25.750
Have you lost your mind?

1:17:27.458 --> 1:17:28.833
We don't have much time.

1:17:29.208 --> 1:17:30.500
We need six more stars.

1:17:30.750 --> 1:17:31.917
Any other choices?

1:17:34.042 --> 1:17:35.042
I disagree.

1:17:36.208 --> 1:17:37.125
I agree.

1:17:39.250 --> 1:17:40.583
If it weren't for you,

1:17:42.000 --> 1:17:44.208
I would've already been conned
into the black room.

1:17:46.375 --> 1:17:47.750
My life depends on you.

1:17:59.458 --> 1:18:00.375
Two stars.

1:18:01.125 --> 1:18:02.208
Add mine.

1:18:04.958 --> 1:18:05.875
Three.

1:18:06.500 --> 1:18:07.583
Talk to them.

1:18:07.958 --> 1:18:10.042
You've got to try no matter what.

1:18:14.208 --> 1:18:15.167
What do you say?

1:19:50.583 --> 1:19:51.542
Referee.

1:19:51.667 --> 1:19:53.917
The game can't be interrupted
after you put down the card, right?

1:20:06.167 --> 1:20:07.458
He doesn't feel right.

1:20:10.917 --> 1:20:12.542
It proves that my deduction

1:20:13.500 --> 1:20:14.625
might be right.

1:20:15.125 --> 1:20:18.083
<i>When he took a card out of his pocket,</i>

1:20:18.375 --> 1:20:20.042
<i>I suddenly realized</i>

1:20:20.208 --> 1:20:21.708
<i>that the total number of cards they hold</i>

1:20:22.958 --> 1:20:24.292
<i>must be an odd number.</i>

1:20:25.208 --> 1:20:26.500
<i>If it's even,</i>

1:20:27.250 --> 1:20:31.542
<i>they could use up all the cards
by deliberating ties between them.</i>

1:20:33.292 --> 1:20:35.000
<i>But if it's an odd number,</i>

1:20:35.292 --> 1:20:38.542
<i>they need one more opponent
to use this extra card</i>

1:20:38.750 --> 1:20:39.875
<i>before they are safe.</i>

1:20:52.583 --> 1:20:54.042
When I stocked a certain type of cards,

1:20:54.125 --> 1:20:56.417
I also paid attention to the amount
of other two types of cards.

1:20:56.500 --> 1:20:58.750
I need to make sure
that the total remains an even number,

1:20:58.833 --> 1:21:00.167
so I can get rid of them with draws.

1:21:00.292 --> 1:21:01.333
<i>Two scissors.</i>

1:21:01.458 --> 1:21:02.458
<i>Four papers.</i>

1:21:03.000 --> 1:21:04.042
<i>It's perfect.</i>

1:21:04.583 --> 1:21:06.167
But for the total number
of cards I stocked,

1:21:06.250 --> 1:21:08.333
even or odd doesn't matter.

1:21:08.458 --> 1:21:10.958
Because I don't know how many games
I have to play in the future.

1:21:11.042 --> 1:21:13.500
<i>It might become an odd number easily.</i>

1:21:13.917 --> 1:21:16.375
<i>For example, suppose you have 30 papers,</i>

1:21:16.458 --> 1:21:18.042
<i>and it becomes odd after three games,</i>

1:21:18.125 --> 1:21:20.417
<i>you'll need a fourth opponent</i>

1:21:20.500 --> 1:21:21.875
<i>to become an even number again.</i>

1:21:21.958 --> 1:21:23.667
<i>When you've played four games
and want to stop,</i>

1:21:23.750 --> 1:21:25.375
<i>but someone still wants to play with you,</i>

1:21:25.458 --> 1:21:28.208
<i>and you have a good chance of winning,
you'll play again.</i>

1:21:28.292 --> 1:21:30.250
<i>The total of cards
will be an odd number again.</i>

1:21:30.417 --> 1:21:32.500
<i>Surely you can use other types of cards</i>

1:21:32.667 --> 1:21:35.375
<i>allocating stars internally
to make papers even,</i>

1:21:35.542 --> 1:21:37.083
<i>and other types odd.</i>

1:21:37.750 --> 1:21:39.083
<i>But for you,</i>

1:21:39.250 --> 1:21:40.875
<i>you'd rather keep papers odd,</i>

1:21:41.250 --> 1:21:43.625
<i>especially when you're competing
with someone who stocked up rocks.</i>

1:21:43.875 --> 1:21:46.458
<i>Surely you'll use the card
with better chances.</i>

1:21:47.875 --> 1:21:52.167
So, I guess this extra card you have
is a paper you stocked.

1:21:52.250 --> 1:21:55.000
Paper. And mine is scissors.

1:22:33.458 --> 1:22:34.375
Motherfucker!

1:22:34.625 --> 1:22:36.583
If you weren't crazy about money
and kept pushing me.

1:22:36.667 --> 1:22:37.792
This wouldn't have happened.

1:22:40.458 --> 1:22:41.292
Hey!

1:22:42.333 --> 1:22:44.250
Sell me your extra cards.

1:22:55.542 --> 1:22:58.917
You could've asked anyone for help
to get rid of this annoying card.

1:23:00.625 --> 1:23:01.917
But you're too arrogant.

1:23:03.000 --> 1:23:04.958
You just wanted to gloat.

1:23:05.500 --> 1:23:06.833
That's why you lost.

1:23:13.375 --> 1:23:14.458
You really think so?

1:23:16.750 --> 1:23:17.875
Look over there.

1:23:19.458 --> 1:23:21.708
They sold all the cards to me.

1:23:23.000 --> 1:23:25.750
Bastard! How dare you betray me!

1:23:29.500 --> 1:23:30.750
Let's work together.

1:23:41.542 --> 1:23:43.208
You should give me 100,000 dollars

1:23:43.583 --> 1:23:45.250
and I'll take all your cards.

1:23:59.792 --> 1:24:03.500
Then I'll tell all of them
what cards you have.

1:24:03.792 --> 1:24:06.625
Whoever buys, becomes an easy target.

1:24:11.333 --> 1:24:12.708
They seem to be

1:24:13.583 --> 1:24:14.917
eight papers

1:24:15.708 --> 1:24:17.083
and two scissors.

1:24:18.875 --> 1:24:20.208
Your friends told me.

1:24:25.875 --> 1:24:26.958
Nice working with you.

1:24:27.375 --> 1:24:28.458
Screw you.

1:24:28.917 --> 1:24:30.250
Go to hell!

1:24:44.625 --> 1:24:47.208
Stocking up papers after rocks.

1:24:47.625 --> 1:24:48.833
Impressive.

1:24:49.542 --> 1:24:52.208
Too bad. It's not necessarily safe.

1:24:53.917 --> 1:24:55.875
Those who did this before,

1:24:58.375 --> 1:24:59.375
all failed.

1:25:02.208 --> 1:25:03.500
I'll give you a star.

1:25:04.542 --> 1:25:06.958
Let your stupid friends have the cards

1:25:07.375 --> 1:25:09.750
and you can get out with this star safely.

1:25:14.583 --> 1:25:15.792
All right. Give it to me.

1:25:17.792 --> 1:25:19.375
You have to give me five cards.

1:25:20.583 --> 1:25:23.042
Three rocks, one scissors, and one paper.

1:25:25.708 --> 1:25:27.625
I knew you are up to no good.

1:25:29.083 --> 1:25:29.958
Rest assured.

1:25:30.917 --> 1:25:33.292
These five cards
will be used against others.

1:25:35.000 --> 1:25:36.042
Deal?

1:25:40.625 --> 1:25:42.958
I will never abandon my friends.

1:25:46.250 --> 1:25:49.458
Care to know what comes after elimination?

1:25:51.625 --> 1:25:53.583
<i>The first time I was on board,</i>

1:25:54.292 --> 1:25:56.083
<i>I was on the brink of elimination.</i>

1:25:57.042 --> 1:25:59.167
<i>Then someone had a seizure.</i>

1:25:59.917 --> 1:26:01.958
<i>I escaped from the scene in chaos.</i>

1:26:02.583 --> 1:26:04.042
<i>That time,</i>

1:26:04.500 --> 1:26:06.667
<i>only five of us got off the ship.</i>

1:26:07.958 --> 1:26:12.000
<i>One of them told me that
there's a medical lab on the bottom deck.</i>

1:26:12.458 --> 1:26:14.833
<i>They were doing genetic tests there.</i>

1:26:17.042 --> 1:26:18.958
I swear on my life.

1:26:20.333 --> 1:26:22.250
I'm not lying this time.

1:26:26.958 --> 1:26:28.167
If you can't get off the ship,

1:26:29.750 --> 1:26:31.333
you'll wish you were dead.

1:26:55.792 --> 1:26:56.792
Remember!

1:26:57.458 --> 1:26:59.708
Loyalty means nothing
in this animal world!

1:27:01.125 --> 1:27:01.958
Idiot.

1:27:05.250 --> 1:27:06.500
We have 69 cards in total.

1:27:07.042 --> 1:27:10.542
We have 30 rocks, 34 papers
and 5 scissors.

1:27:13.083 --> 1:27:14.667
Besides us three,

1:27:15.083 --> 1:27:16.458
there are 38 people on this floor.

1:27:16.542 --> 1:27:18.917
And 22 of them have no cards left.

1:27:19.000 --> 1:27:20.750
They're waiting to buy stars.

1:27:21.208 --> 1:27:23.875
Now there are only 16 people
that can still play.

1:27:28.125 --> 1:27:29.333
<i>Besides the cards we have,</i>

1:27:29.708 --> 1:27:33.583
<i>there are nine rocks, nine scissors
and five papers left.</i>

1:27:35.042 --> 1:27:36.292
We'll make our move

1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:38.208
when two more papers are recycled.

1:27:51.542 --> 1:27:52.417
Let's go.

1:28:06.333 --> 1:28:07.583
May I have your attention?

1:28:12.542 --> 1:28:14.167
Please adjust your headsets to my channel.

1:28:16.250 --> 1:28:18.917
Not many cards are left among us.

1:28:20.167 --> 1:28:22.792
Your opponent probably

1:28:23.500 --> 1:28:25.875
already knows your cards.

1:28:27.042 --> 1:28:30.417
Therefore, I propose
we gather all the cards

1:28:31.708 --> 1:28:33.000
and reshuffle them!

1:28:35.292 --> 1:28:37.833
This will expose our plan.

1:28:44.542 --> 1:28:46.958
Some of you might think I'm bluffing.

1:28:48.792 --> 1:28:49.875
All right then.

1:28:50.667 --> 1:28:52.292
Let me prove it to you.

1:28:54.417 --> 1:28:56.250
No. 57, the man wearing a hat over there,

1:28:56.375 --> 1:28:58.167
you have a scissors card left.

1:28:59.375 --> 1:29:00.625
No. 7, the man with long hair,

1:29:00.708 --> 1:29:02.542
you have a rock left.

1:29:02.625 --> 1:29:03.708
The man with blonde hair,

1:29:03.792 --> 1:29:04.917
you have a paper.

1:29:05.000 --> 1:29:05.958
Am I right?

1:29:06.042 --> 1:29:06.958
Nonsense.

1:29:07.375 --> 1:29:08.625
My card isn't scissors.

1:29:08.958 --> 1:29:10.333
Stop lying to yourself.

1:29:10.417 --> 1:29:12.917
Many of you bought cards from others.

1:29:13.000 --> 1:29:14.417
Those who sold the cards to you,

1:29:14.500 --> 1:29:15.583
without any hesitation,

1:29:15.667 --> 1:29:17.708
would sell the information to others.

1:29:17.833 --> 1:29:19.625
Many bought information from them,

1:29:19.875 --> 1:29:21.500
so all of you

1:29:21.583 --> 1:29:22.750
are easy targets.

1:29:27.250 --> 1:29:28.083
Understand?

1:29:30.333 --> 1:29:32.250
-I'm in.
-Me too.

1:29:32.333 --> 1:29:33.250
-Me too.
-Count me in.

1:29:33.500 --> 1:29:34.583
-Me too.
-I'm in.

1:29:34.667 --> 1:29:35.958
-Me too.
-Count me in.

1:29:36.958 --> 1:29:39.583
-Me too.
-Count me in.

1:29:40.917 --> 1:29:41.750
-I'm in.
-I'm in.

1:30:04.667 --> 1:30:06.042
How come there are only a dozen cards?

1:30:06.333 --> 1:30:08.333
The board shows there's more.

1:30:09.375 --> 1:30:11.875
Some of you must be stocking cards.

1:30:12.625 --> 1:30:14.042
That's why they're afraid

1:30:14.292 --> 1:30:16.375
and don't want to reshuffle cards.

1:30:17.083 --> 1:30:17.958
How about this?

1:30:18.792 --> 1:30:20.125
After reshuffle,

1:30:20.792 --> 1:30:24.250
we only play among ourselves.

1:30:25.667 --> 1:30:27.292
This will lower the risks.

1:30:39.542 --> 1:30:40.583
We're in too.

1:30:42.000 --> 1:30:43.083
Sure.

1:30:43.667 --> 1:30:45.000
How many cards do you have?

1:30:53.167 --> 1:30:54.917
Three scissors are missing.

1:30:57.125 --> 1:30:58.000
Hey!

1:30:59.250 --> 1:31:00.625
You are offered another chance.

1:31:01.583 --> 1:31:03.000
If you don't join us now,

1:31:04.208 --> 1:31:06.542
you'll be stuck with your cards.

1:31:08.333 --> 1:31:09.292
No more waiting.

1:31:50.125 --> 1:31:51.542
Hurry up and play.

1:32:00.750 --> 1:32:03.458
You asked for it!

1:32:41.583 --> 1:32:42.708
There are 32 rocks.

1:32:44.042 --> 1:32:45.042
Three scissors.

1:32:45.250 --> 1:32:46.792
And 34 papers.

1:32:47.583 --> 1:32:49.500
We have all the papers.

1:32:49.792 --> 1:32:51.708
Besides the cards we have,

1:32:52.167 --> 1:32:53.875
there are two rocks and five scissors.

1:32:55.125 --> 1:32:56.625
There aren't that many scissors left.

1:33:00.292 --> 1:33:01.417
No time for that.

1:33:01.792 --> 1:33:02.875
Play the rocks.

1:33:02.958 --> 1:33:04.292
The worst case is a draw.

1:33:05.667 --> 1:33:09.542
Don't touch me.

1:33:09.625 --> 1:33:12.625
Or I'll show you how bad I can be.

1:33:12.708 --> 1:33:15.500
-Don't touch me.
-Losing will only cost you a star,

1:33:15.708 --> 1:33:17.958
which you can buy afterward.

1:33:18.750 --> 1:33:20.708
But if you don't use this card,

1:33:21.458 --> 1:33:22.750
you are dead for sure.

1:33:23.500 --> 1:33:25.417
Don't push him if he doesn't want to play.

1:33:26.250 --> 1:33:27.208
I'll play with you.

1:33:32.792 --> 1:33:33.792
Play with me.

1:33:34.292 --> 1:33:35.917
I'll give you two stars if you win.

1:33:36.250 --> 1:33:38.500
If you lose, you can give me just one.

1:33:38.750 --> 1:33:39.792
How about that?

1:33:41.458 --> 1:33:42.667
Are you stupid?

1:33:43.417 --> 1:33:45.250
He has 69 cards in his hand.

1:33:45.833 --> 1:33:48.250
Surely he can figure out
what card will win.

1:33:55.708 --> 1:33:57.125
I've told you.

1:33:58.333 --> 1:34:00.250
Stocking cards won't work.

1:34:01.625 --> 1:34:03.458
How do you know that I won't lose?

1:34:04.750 --> 1:34:05.792
My guess.

1:34:07.583 --> 1:34:10.542
Why else would you bet two stars for one?

1:34:11.250 --> 1:34:12.250
Are you sure?

1:34:13.083 --> 1:34:14.083
Yes.

1:34:15.083 --> 1:34:18.167
That means you know I have 34 papers.

1:34:19.417 --> 1:34:21.875
This is the only way I'll win this game.

1:34:22.542 --> 1:34:23.875
What are you implying?

1:34:24.083 --> 1:34:26.000
Since you're sure
that I have all the papers,

1:34:26.083 --> 1:34:29.458
you must know a rock will guarantee a win.

1:34:29.708 --> 1:34:30.583
Right?

1:34:31.667 --> 1:34:33.875
He defeated my scissors
with a rock just now.

1:34:33.958 --> 1:34:36.125
-That was a coincidence.
-That was not a coincidence.

1:34:37.125 --> 1:34:37.958
This man,

1:34:38.333 --> 1:34:42.250
at the beginning of the games,
won two stars of mine by cheating.

1:34:42.333 --> 1:34:44.250
Then he tried to trade stars for my cards.

1:34:44.542 --> 1:34:45.958
He has targeted his prey.

1:34:46.042 --> 1:34:48.917
He won't lose
as long as he has the right cards.

1:34:49.292 --> 1:34:50.667
When I refused him,

1:34:51.083 --> 1:34:52.625
he suggested reshuffling the cards.

1:34:52.792 --> 1:34:53.917
If I'm right,

1:34:54.000 --> 1:34:56.125
he cheated again
while reshuffling the cards.

1:34:56.375 --> 1:34:57.875
<i> He gave me all the papers</i>

1:34:57.958 --> 1:34:59.958
<i>and saved the rocks to himself.</i>

1:35:00.125 --> 1:35:01.750
<i>He gave the scissors to his prey.</i>

1:35:02.042 --> 1:35:04.083
<i>Those who has only one card left.</i>

1:35:11.833 --> 1:35:13.417
Have some common sense.

1:35:15.292 --> 1:35:16.833
I dealt the cards face down.

1:35:17.542 --> 1:35:18.833
You all saw that, right?

1:35:19.083 --> 1:35:21.958
Even if I could save rocks for myself,

1:35:22.708 --> 1:35:25.625
there's no way for me to know
who has scissors.

1:35:26.042 --> 1:35:28.083
What if you marked the cards?

1:35:37.542 --> 1:35:39.125
Three scissors are missing.

1:35:43.042 --> 1:35:44.042
No more waiting.

1:35:46.958 --> 1:35:48.917
You have scissors, right?

1:35:56.250 --> 1:35:57.292
Zheng Kai-si.

1:35:59.333 --> 1:36:00.750
What the hell are you doing?

1:36:02.750 --> 1:36:04.500
It's like we are playing
with open cards now.

1:36:06.167 --> 1:36:07.750
Nobody is willing to play anymore.

1:36:08.917 --> 1:36:10.667
Then I'll play it blindly.

1:36:13.125 --> 1:36:15.625
<i>Now, I'm the only one
who has all the three kinds of cards.</i>

1:36:15.958 --> 1:36:19.708
<i>I'll mix up the order
and put them on the table face down.</i>

1:36:19.958 --> 1:36:22.792
<i>You can choose the card I play.</i>

1:36:23.500 --> 1:36:25.375
<i>I won't touch them.</i>

1:36:26.042 --> 1:36:27.667
<i>Once the result is revealed,</i>

1:36:27.958 --> 1:36:30.917
<i>you can flip the other two to confirm.</i>

1:36:31.000 --> 1:36:32.125
<i>It's fair enough.</i>

1:37:03.333 --> 1:37:04.208
Next.

1:37:20.500 --> 1:37:23.125
It all depends on luck.
Is it to our disadvantage?

1:37:23.333 --> 1:37:24.333
Next.

1:37:30.250 --> 1:37:32.750
It's paper.

1:37:35.917 --> 1:37:37.458
Do you want to get off the ship?

1:37:37.542 --> 1:37:39.458
I won!

1:37:39.583 --> 1:37:41.333
Who didn't participate in the reshuffling?

1:37:42.583 --> 1:37:44.333
We have five minutes left.

1:37:44.500 --> 1:37:45.958
It's almost showtime.

1:37:46.583 --> 1:37:47.750
Five minutes!

1:37:48.625 --> 1:37:50.458
It's not going to help
if you hide in the crowd.

1:37:52.625 --> 1:37:54.208
Step out and play the game with me.

1:37:59.167 --> 1:38:00.917
If that person really wants to play,

1:38:01.833 --> 1:38:03.333
he'll play with me.

1:38:04.625 --> 1:38:06.292
At least he still has a chance.

1:38:10.208 --> 1:38:11.667
I can give you stars

1:38:12.542 --> 1:38:14.083
and make sure you get off safely!

1:38:14.958 --> 1:38:17.333
-Just step out and play with me!
-Stop yelling.

1:38:18.417 --> 1:38:19.875
There's no such person.

1:38:23.708 --> 1:38:26.583
Remember the guy
who flushed his cards down the toilet?

1:38:28.333 --> 1:38:29.917
<i>Three scissors are missing.</i>

1:38:30.833 --> 1:38:33.208
<i>And now, it seems like</i>

1:38:34.083 --> 1:38:35.917
<i>he flushed three scissors.</i>

1:38:37.875 --> 1:38:38.792
<i>What a shame.</i>

1:38:39.667 --> 1:38:43.250
<i>The board only counts recycled cards.</i>

1:38:43.917 --> 1:38:44.917
<i>You've been fooled.</i>

1:38:45.333 --> 1:38:47.667
<i>I found that out
when you were reshuffling.</i>

1:38:47.792 --> 1:38:49.667
<i>There aren't that many scissors left.</i>

1:38:50.167 --> 1:38:52.292
<i>Winning or losing doesn't matter
in a blind game.</i>

1:38:52.625 --> 1:38:56.625
<i>The point is to consume the others' cards.</i>

1:38:58.458 --> 1:39:01.000
Now, I'm the only one who has the cards.

1:39:02.458 --> 1:39:04.000
If you've made up your mind,

1:39:04.625 --> 1:39:06.083
find me at Table Six.

1:39:08.125 --> 1:39:09.375
I'll be there waiting for you.

1:39:17.917 --> 1:39:19.917
I'm safe. Goodbye.

1:39:38.958 --> 1:39:40.208
I bet five stars.

1:39:41.542 --> 1:39:42.667
Three.

1:39:43.917 --> 1:39:46.208
You don't have the leverage
to bargain with me.

1:39:48.167 --> 1:39:49.958
I don't mind anyway.

1:39:50.458 --> 1:39:53.000
I'll just drag the three of you
down with me.

1:39:54.417 --> 1:39:55.417
Totally worth it.

1:39:56.542 --> 1:39:58.625
You are so familiar
with the cards we have,

1:39:59.500 --> 1:40:01.208
then why don't you do the math?

1:40:06.208 --> 1:40:08.708
We have 69 cards in total.

1:40:09.083 --> 1:40:10.250
In the blind game just now,

1:40:10.333 --> 1:40:12.458
we used one scissors,
one rock and one paper.

1:40:13.083 --> 1:40:15.708
So now we have 66 cards.

1:40:16.333 --> 1:40:17.458
An even number.

1:40:18.458 --> 1:40:19.917
If you don't play with us,

1:40:20.000 --> 1:40:24.125
we could consume all the cards
through draws among us.

1:40:24.208 --> 1:40:26.583
You'll be the only one
who'd end up in the black room.

1:40:26.708 --> 1:40:27.667
As for us,

1:40:28.292 --> 1:40:29.917
we can still buy stars.

1:40:31.000 --> 1:40:32.500
But we may get into trouble

1:40:32.792 --> 1:40:34.500
if you play with us.

1:40:35.292 --> 1:40:36.792
If I win you with a paper,

1:40:37.042 --> 1:40:39.792
we'll have 65 cards left.

1:40:43.500 --> 1:40:45.042
There will be an extra card,

1:40:45.833 --> 1:40:47.958
which will never be played.

1:40:49.542 --> 1:40:52.250
One of us will go to the black room.

1:40:52.708 --> 1:40:54.083
-Dude.
-Don't worry.

1:40:54.833 --> 1:40:55.875
I will go.

1:40:57.542 --> 1:40:58.667
Big Shrimp.

1:40:59.417 --> 1:41:02.375
You said there's one last chance
of redemption.

1:41:02.875 --> 1:41:04.708
It could just be hearsay.

1:41:04.792 --> 1:41:05.625
What if--

1:41:07.167 --> 1:41:08.708
This whole time,

1:41:09.083 --> 1:41:11.750
no decisions were risk-free for us.

1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:40.875
Apologize...

1:41:44.667 --> 1:41:46.500
to all the people you have cheated.

1:41:53.083 --> 1:41:54.167
I'm sorry.

1:41:54.750 --> 1:41:56.083
Slap yourself hard.

1:41:59.167 --> 1:42:00.833
-We don't have time, Zheng Kai-si.
-Hurry up!

1:42:06.917 --> 1:42:08.625
Too soft. Do it again.

1:42:11.625 --> 1:42:13.125
Not hard enough. Do it again.

1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:17.583
Harder! Again!

1:43:24.833 --> 1:43:26.125
Just get me out.

1:44:15.500 --> 1:44:16.417
Hey.

1:44:18.417 --> 1:44:20.458
Do you still have the chance to get out?

1:44:22.958 --> 1:44:24.125
Come here and sit.

1:44:36.542 --> 1:44:38.083
This seat is for the VIP.

1:44:39.208 --> 1:44:40.833
It's easy to point you out later.

1:44:54.125 --> 1:44:55.042
Young man!

1:44:55.417 --> 1:44:57.333
Did you see a man

1:44:57.708 --> 1:44:59.208
in a white suit outside?

1:45:02.125 --> 1:45:03.500
You mean No. 29?

1:45:05.042 --> 1:45:06.000
Yes.

1:45:06.333 --> 1:45:08.208
That's him. No. 29.

1:45:09.125 --> 1:45:10.542
He should be upstairs long ago.

1:45:12.958 --> 1:45:14.833
Am I right, old man?

1:45:15.875 --> 1:45:17.708
You must have been tricked.

1:45:19.500 --> 1:45:20.417
What happened?

1:45:22.000 --> 1:45:23.042
He told me

1:45:24.000 --> 1:45:24.833
in here.

1:45:25.458 --> 1:45:29.583
<i>I can see their cards from behind.</i>

1:45:29.750 --> 1:45:31.708
<i>He asked me to come in
to give him signals.</i>

1:45:31.917 --> 1:45:34.542
<i>When he has enough stars,
he would get me out of here.</i>

1:45:34.958 --> 1:45:35.875
<i>But</i>

1:45:36.208 --> 1:45:38.167
<i>he went to the bathroom halfway.</i>

1:45:38.625 --> 1:45:39.917
<i>I can't find him anymore.</i>

1:45:41.333 --> 1:45:42.625
You helped him cheat?

1:45:43.750 --> 1:45:45.375
Why are you so surprised?

1:45:46.458 --> 1:45:50.500
My partner and I
played this trick several times.

1:45:52.458 --> 1:45:53.875
Those over there

1:45:54.875 --> 1:45:56.708
were sent here by us.

1:45:57.625 --> 1:45:59.125
That man said

1:45:59.208 --> 1:46:02.250
that cheating is allowed.

1:46:02.833 --> 1:46:03.708
So...

1:46:04.417 --> 1:46:06.167
So, I agreed to his plan.

1:46:06.875 --> 1:46:09.083
But you came in with empty hands.

1:46:15.333 --> 1:46:17.458
So did you.

1:46:20.125 --> 1:46:21.792
You might not make it.

1:46:23.208 --> 1:46:24.500
What do you mean?

1:46:26.375 --> 1:46:27.375
You mean...

1:47:03.083 --> 1:47:05.875
I wonder if I could skip the trade

1:47:06.417 --> 1:47:08.875
and use my extra stars to save my friend.

1:47:15.792 --> 1:47:16.792
Did you see that?

1:47:17.500 --> 1:47:18.583
He is my childhood pal.

1:47:28.125 --> 1:47:29.708
-What the hell?
-Move!

1:47:32.542 --> 1:47:34.208
This is for saving my friend.

1:47:35.125 --> 1:47:36.917
-For 200,000!
-Shut up!

1:47:37.250 --> 1:47:38.250
Shut up!

1:47:38.667 --> 1:47:40.000
We have one extra star anyway.

1:47:40.083 --> 1:47:41.208
Just sell it.

1:47:41.292 --> 1:47:42.708
Let's rescue him first.

1:47:44.292 --> 1:47:46.000
We can't get through without selling.

1:47:50.125 --> 1:47:50.958
Fine.

1:47:51.125 --> 1:47:52.500
It's 500,000 for one star, any buyers?

1:47:52.583 --> 1:47:55.083
-Me!
-Sell it to me!

1:47:58.333 --> 1:47:59.958
It's not for sale. It's for my friend!

1:48:01.917 --> 1:48:03.833
-Big Shrimp.
-I want to save him.

1:48:04.000 --> 1:48:04.917
No. 72.

1:48:15.250 --> 1:48:16.375
I disagree.

1:48:17.583 --> 1:48:18.750
I don't want to save him.

1:48:22.000 --> 1:48:23.083
Three stars

1:48:23.167 --> 1:48:25.583
worth at least 1.5 million dollars.

1:48:25.750 --> 1:48:28.333
It can get even higher later on.

1:48:29.708 --> 1:48:30.917
Meng Guo-xiang.

1:48:32.042 --> 1:48:33.833
You're despicable.

1:48:35.042 --> 1:48:36.125
I made up my name.

1:48:36.833 --> 1:48:37.750
The wallet?

1:48:38.167 --> 1:48:39.208
I stole it.

1:48:39.292 --> 1:48:40.292
I don't have a daughter.

1:48:41.417 --> 1:48:43.417
I have nothing except these three stars.

1:48:44.083 --> 1:48:46.000
I don't know why you got on board,

1:48:46.333 --> 1:48:48.417
but don't you think that these three stars

1:48:48.708 --> 1:48:50.958
are our only hope?

1:48:51.750 --> 1:48:53.833
Do you really want to give up
a chance like this?

1:48:54.333 --> 1:48:55.458
Big Shrimp!

1:48:56.875 --> 1:48:58.583
Now I see who you really are.

1:48:59.542 --> 1:49:01.125
If you listen to me right now...

1:49:01.333 --> 1:49:02.708
Big Shrimp, don't listen to him!

1:49:02.792 --> 1:49:04.000
Don't save him.

1:49:04.250 --> 1:49:06.083
We can get off the ship with a fortune.

1:49:06.208 --> 1:49:08.417
At least ten million.

1:49:09.000 --> 1:49:10.542
Ten million.

1:49:11.125 --> 1:49:12.208
If you rescue him,

1:49:12.417 --> 1:49:14.083
we could leave here alive.

1:49:14.167 --> 1:49:16.042
But don't forget that the interest

1:49:16.125 --> 1:49:17.917
on the 500,000 we borrowed
rolls by the minute.

1:49:18.000 --> 1:49:20.167
Do you have any idea
how big that number is?

1:49:20.667 --> 1:49:21.917
Astronomical.

1:49:23.208 --> 1:49:24.917
Do the math.

1:49:26.167 --> 1:49:27.583
Who can pay it off?

1:49:29.750 --> 1:49:30.917
Who can?

1:49:32.417 --> 1:49:33.625
If you are in,

1:49:34.083 --> 1:49:35.167
I'll give you a share.

1:49:35.750 --> 1:49:37.083
If you want to rescue him,

1:49:38.500 --> 1:49:39.958
you can have this money.

1:49:42.042 --> 1:49:43.417
Figure out how to save him on your own.

1:49:45.542 --> 1:49:46.417
Big Shrimp.

1:49:46.667 --> 1:49:49.375
Go get the stars back!
My life depends on it!

1:49:49.500 --> 1:49:50.583
Stars for sale!

1:49:50.792 --> 1:49:51.792
Who wants to buy?

1:49:52.000 --> 1:49:53.542
Follow me if you want to buy it.

1:49:54.708 --> 1:49:55.708
Big Shrimp!

1:49:57.625 --> 1:49:58.667
Big Shrimp!

1:49:59.000 --> 1:50:00.042
Big Shrimp!

1:50:01.625 --> 1:50:02.708
Big Shrimp!

1:50:04.917 --> 1:50:05.875
Big Shrimp!

1:50:07.292 --> 1:50:08.500
Big Shrimp.

1:50:11.125 --> 1:50:12.667
People die for wealth.

1:50:14.250 --> 1:50:15.583
It's the human nature.

1:50:24.625 --> 1:50:25.958
I'm sorry, buddy.

1:50:27.667 --> 1:50:29.000
From this day on,

1:50:31.250 --> 1:50:32.167
your mom

1:50:33.458 --> 1:50:34.667
is my mom.

1:50:35.375 --> 1:50:36.542
I'll take care of her for you.

1:50:40.208 --> 1:50:41.208
Big Shrimp!

1:50:41.875 --> 1:50:42.708
Li Jun!

1:50:43.458 --> 1:50:44.333
Li Jun!

1:50:52.042 --> 1:50:53.917
Coming in with empty hands,

1:50:54.542 --> 1:50:57.250
you can't even trust your blood brother.

1:50:59.458 --> 1:51:02.125
You should've brought something valuable.

1:51:04.000 --> 1:51:05.083
Otherwise,

1:51:06.333 --> 1:51:08.375
why would they redeem you?

1:51:10.208 --> 1:51:12.083
You'll die here sooner or later

1:51:13.375 --> 1:51:15.542
if you're so naive.

1:51:16.792 --> 1:51:18.917
In this animal world,

1:51:19.250 --> 1:51:22.125
there's only profit, no emotions.

1:51:22.500 --> 1:51:24.792
<i>There's a medical lab on the bottom deck.</i>

1:51:24.875 --> 1:51:26.708
<i>They were doing genetic tests there.</i>

1:51:27.208 --> 1:51:29.250
<i>And we'll pay the debt as lab rats.</i>

1:51:29.750 --> 1:51:31.833
<i>If you can't get off the ship,
you'll wish you were dead.</i>

1:51:31.917 --> 1:51:34.083
<i>People die for wealth.
It's the human nature.</i>

1:51:34.417 --> 1:51:36.917
<i>You can't even trust your blood brother.</i>

1:52:02.958 --> 1:52:03.875
Young man.

1:52:05.125 --> 1:52:06.208
Are you all right?

1:52:15.500 --> 1:52:17.333
Three stars are worth
at least 1.5 million.

1:52:18.458 --> 1:52:19.750
It's 10,000 dollars per stack.

1:52:20.667 --> 1:52:23.250
Thus, 1.5 million
requires at least three bags like so.

1:52:24.958 --> 1:52:26.583
The money in Scar Face's bag

1:52:26.792 --> 1:52:28.417
can only buy one star.

1:52:29.292 --> 1:52:32.083
But they'll pay triple to get him out.

1:52:33.042 --> 1:52:34.375
According to his theory,

1:52:34.833 --> 1:52:37.375
he must be worth much more.

1:52:38.708 --> 1:52:40.458
Therefore, I'm sure

1:52:40.958 --> 1:52:43.083
he must carry something valuable.

1:52:43.875 --> 1:52:48.000
<i>My partner and I
played this trick several times.</i>

1:52:48.083 --> 1:52:49.792
<i>It's not the first time
they've been on board.</i>

1:52:50.792 --> 1:52:53.917
<i>They must know
how to bring valuables up here</i>

1:52:54.708 --> 1:52:56.250
<i>and take it to the black room.</i>

1:52:56.750 --> 1:53:00.083
<i>Tight bandage is bad
for discharging fluids.</i>

1:53:01.208 --> 1:53:02.917
It limits new flesh to grow.

1:53:03.750 --> 1:53:06.250
Airtight environment
will form an anaerobic zone,

1:53:07.458 --> 1:53:09.292
which breeds anaerobes,

1:53:09.833 --> 1:53:11.333
causing tetanus eventually.

1:53:13.000 --> 1:53:14.250
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

1:53:14.792 --> 1:53:16.417
My friend recited this every day

1:53:17.375 --> 1:53:18.958
when she was preparing for her exam.

1:53:20.542 --> 1:53:21.458
No.

1:53:21.958 --> 1:53:23.167
To be more accurate,

1:53:23.750 --> 1:53:25.083
she is my girlfriend.

1:53:25.458 --> 1:53:26.542
Show me the stuff.

1:53:29.583 --> 1:53:30.542
Where's the bandage?

1:53:46.583 --> 1:53:49.208
-This is all we have.
-Redeem him.

1:53:49.542 --> 1:53:50.375
Him.

1:53:57.250 --> 1:53:58.333
Young man.

1:53:58.917 --> 1:53:59.750
Young man.

1:54:00.208 --> 1:54:01.167
Young man!

1:54:03.292 --> 1:54:04.458
Please.

1:54:05.042 --> 1:54:07.167
Send a message to my son.

1:54:08.042 --> 1:54:09.375
Tell him to change the medications

1:54:09.875 --> 1:54:11.500
to cheaper ones

1:54:12.167 --> 1:54:14.375
so he will survive a few more months.

1:54:16.292 --> 1:54:18.042
And please tell him

1:54:19.458 --> 1:54:20.833
that I've tried my best.

1:54:28.167 --> 1:54:29.875
Just a call will do.

1:54:30.750 --> 1:54:33.333
It's 17310511913.

1:54:34.917 --> 1:54:37.042
Young man, please!

1:54:37.625 --> 1:54:39.458
Please!

1:54:41.583 --> 1:54:43.750
<i>-I have fought</i>
<i>-I have fought</i>

1:54:43.833 --> 1:54:46.083

<i>Fight.</i>

1:55:01.333 --> 1:55:02.750
<i>No bottom line.</i>

1:55:03.667 --> 1:55:06.042
<i>These things tried to turn me
into an animal.</i>

1:55:08.292 --> 1:55:09.250
<i>No way.</i>

1:55:11.125 --> 1:55:15.000
<i>I'd rather be a clown
who fights for himself his whole life</i>

1:55:15.167 --> 1:55:18.292
<i>than become a group of scums like you.</i>

1:55:19.792 --> 1:55:21.375
<i>The game is yours.</i>

1:55:22.625 --> 1:55:23.750
<i>But the rules</i>

1:55:23.833 --> 1:55:25.542
<i>will be set by me.</i>

1:55:47.625 --> 1:55:49.542
<i>To hell with the Animal World.</i>

1:55:49.750 --> 1:55:50.750
<i>I</i>

1:55:51.500 --> 1:55:52.875
<i>don't give a damn.</i>

1:56:13.625 --> 1:56:14.667
Give me the stars.

1:56:16.917 --> 1:56:17.833
Give them to me!

1:56:26.167 --> 1:56:27.083
Kai-si.

1:56:29.833 --> 1:56:31.125
Our years of friendship

1:56:32.875 --> 1:56:34.375
couldn't beat these bags of money.

1:56:36.792 --> 1:56:37.667
Really?

1:56:54.833 --> 1:56:55.792
I will redeem him.

1:57:02.167 --> 1:57:03.417
I think it'll be better

1:57:04.250 --> 1:57:06.375
if you tell your son that in person.

1:57:07.083 --> 1:57:08.792
I lost my dad when I was eight.

1:57:09.625 --> 1:57:11.958
So, I understand how your son feels now.

1:57:12.750 --> 1:57:14.833
He might not need expensive medications.

1:57:16.917 --> 1:57:18.167
But he definitely

1:57:19.292 --> 1:57:20.500
needs you.

1:57:25.833 --> 1:57:26.917
Young man.

1:57:27.375 --> 1:57:28.917
Thank you.

1:59:21.708 --> 1:59:22.583
Bastard.

1:59:42.167 --> 1:59:43.125
Zheng Kai-si.

1:59:44.500 --> 1:59:46.208
You should go to hell.

1:59:48.958 --> 1:59:50.000
That's what I deserve.

1:59:53.958 --> 1:59:55.833
But I only want to die in your arms.

2:00:06.375 --> 2:00:07.500
<i>I have fought</i>

2:00:08.375 --> 2:00:09.750

<i>I'm still the clown in their eyes.</i>

2:00:31.625 --> 2:00:32.750

2:01:09.875 --> 2:01:10.917
