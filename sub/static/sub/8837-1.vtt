DO THE COLLECTING
FOR YOU?

WHY CAN'T THEY TAKE UP
THE COLLECTION FOR YOU?

GET WORD TO THEM?

I OUGHT TO BE DOING
THE LORD'S WORK.

08:14.785 --> 08:17.871
AND HERE I GO
PICKING UP
A COLLECTION FOR HIM.

08:18.039 --> 08:19.789
OH, YOU'RE
NOT, CALEB.

08:19.957 --> 08:20.916
OH, YES, I AM.

08:21.083 --> 08:22.042

I THINK HE MEANT

08:22.210 --> 08:23.793
FOR FOLKS TO BE
KIND AND GENEROUS.

08:23.961 --> 08:27.631
AND I'M THE ONE
THEY'RE GOING TO BE
KIND AND GENEROUS TO!

08:34.388 --> 08:38.892
CALEB, YOU'RE GOING TO
GET IN TROUBLE AGAIN.

08:39.060 --> 08:40.268
AND THIS TIME,

THEY WON'T
LET YOU GO.

FOR THE NEEDY?

08:45.650 --> 08:47.025
TROUBLE?
JUST AS LONG AS
I DON'T TELL THEM

08:47.193 --> 08:48.193
WE'RE THE NEEDY.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.111
YOU PROMISED ME
WHEN WE CAME OUT HERE

08:50.279 --> 08:51.530
WE WERE GOING TO
HAVE A NEW LIFE.

08:51.697 --> 08:52.864
THAT'S WHAT I AIM TO DO.

08:53.032 --> 08:54.991
YOU SAID IT
WAS A SIGN,
AN HONEST LIFE.

08:55.159 --> 08:57.661
WHEN YOU FOUND
THE SHACK, IT
WAS A SIGN, CALEB.

08:57.828 --> 08:59.454
IT WAS A PLACE TO
KEEP WARM IN, MATTIE,

08:59.622 --> 09:00.914
A PLACE TO HIDE,
A PLACE TO WAIT

09:01.082 --> 09:03.208
UNTIL SOMETHING BETTER
COME ALONG,
THAT'S ALL.

09:03.376 --> 09:05.627
IT'S NOT WHAT
YOU SAID THEN.

09:05.795 --> 09:07.587
WELL, THEN IS THEN,
AND NOW IS NOW!

09:11.342 --> 09:13.218
MATTIE, I'M NOT GOING
TO HAVE YOU GRIPPING
OUT A LIVING

09:13.386 --> 09:16.263
IN THIS PLACE FOR
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

09:16.430 --> 09:17.931
I'D BE WILLING.

09:18.099 --> 09:20.225
WELL, I'M NOT.

09:20.393 --> 09:23.436
BUT TO TAKE FROM THEM
THAT'S NEEDY, CALEB.

09:23.604 --> 09:24.729
THAT'S CRUEL.

09:24.897 --> 09:26.398
YOU TAKE WHAT YOU CAN
WHEN YOU CAN GET IT

09:26.566 --> 09:28.358
OR IT GETS TAKEN
AWAY FROM YOU.

09:28.526 --> 09:30.151
AND THAT'S THE WAY
THE WORLD IS.

09:30.319 --> 09:31.820
NOW, YOU TOOK DOWN
THE NAMES OF THEM
FOLKS THAT ARE

09:31.988 --> 09:34.155

MY GOOD WORK
AT GRAY'S CORNER,

NOW, YOU KEEP
THE REVEREND HERE
UNTIL SATURDAY,

09:49.213 --> 09:51.172
THEN SEND HIM OFF

TIME, I PROMISE.

12:57.818 --> 12:59.903
AND KIND OF LET HIM
KNOW WHO'S STINGY
AND WHO'S GENEROUS.

13:00.070 --> 13:01.863
Caroline: MARY.

13:02.031 --> 13:03.698
MRS. INGALLS,
AS I TOLD YOU,

13:03.866 --> 13:05.909
THE NEED IS GREAT.
IT WOULD REALLY HELP.

13:06.076 --> 13:07.869
PLEASE, MA.

13:08.037 --> 13:09.579
ALL RIGHT.

13:09.747 --> 13:11.790
LOOKS LIKE YOU GOT
YOURSELF A HELPER.

13:21.008 --> 13:24.469
I, UH, I BELIEVE
THIS IS ABOUT
AS HIGH A FIGURE

13:24.637 --> 13:26.471
AS I CAN GO,
BROTHER HODGEKISS.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.139
THAT'S VERY
GENEROUS OF YOU.

13:28.307 --> 13:29.933
I GUESS THINGS
AREN'T GOING TOO
WELL AT THE BANK,

13:30.100 --> 13:31.226
ARE THEY,
MR. SPRAGUE?

13:31.393 --> 13:33.186
NOW, WHY WOULD
YOU SAY THAT?

13:33.354 --> 13:35.563
BECAUSE I KNOW
IF THINGS WERE GOOD,
YOU'D GIVE MORE,

13:35.731 --> 13:37.106
GENEROUS AS YOU ARE.

13:38.400 --> 13:39.609
HO HO HO.

13:39.777 --> 13:42.195
THAT'S A MIGHTY POWERFUL
ARGUMENT YOU GOT THERE

13:42.363 --> 13:44.280
WITH YOU, BROTHER.
I GUESS I, UH...

13:44.448 --> 13:47.784
[CLEARS THROAT]
I COULD GO
ANOTHER $10.00.

13:47.952 --> 13:48.993
THE LORD BLESS
YOU FOR IT.

13:49.161 --> 13:50.745
YES, WELL, UH...

13:50.913 --> 13:54.123
AT LEAST HALF THE BLESSING
BELONGS TO YOUR LITTLE, UH,
ARGUMENT HERE.

13:54.291 --> 13:56.084
THANK YOU, MR. SPRAGUE.

13:59.505 --> 14:01.297
I THINK WE OUGHT TO SEE
THE OLESONS NEXT.

14:01.465 --> 14:03.174
THEN WE CAN TELL THEM
HOW MUCH MR. SPRAGUE
HAS GIVEN.

14:03.342 --> 14:04.717
AND THEY'LL TRY
TO OUTDO IT.

14:04.885 --> 14:07.887
YOU TALK TO MR. OLESON,
NOT MRS. I'LL HANDLE HER.

14:09.807 --> 14:11.015
GOOD MORNING, MARY.

14:11.183 --> 14:12.141
-GOOD MORNING,
MRS. OLESON.
-GOOD MORNING.

14:12.309 --> 14:13.393
GOOD MORNING,
MR. OLESON.

14:13.561 --> 14:14.978
I'D LIKE YOU
TO MEET A FRIEND
OF MINE.

14:15.145 --> 14:16.688
THIS IS MR. OLESON,
THE MAN I WAS
TELLING YOU ABOUT,

14:16.856 --> 14:17.981
BROTHER HODGEKISS.

14:18.148 --> 14:20.149
-THE FINEST MERCHANT
FOR MILES AROUND.
-AHEM.

14:20.317 --> 14:22.694
AND MRS. OLESON,
YOU'RE JUST THE PERSON
I WANTED TO SEE.

14:22.862 --> 14:25.905
-IF YOU'LL EXCUSE US.
-UH, WELL...

14:28.993 --> 14:30.577
WOULD YOU MIND
EXPLAINING TO ME,
YOUNG LADY,

14:30.744 --> 14:31.995
WHAT THIS IS
ALL ABOUT?

14:32.162 --> 14:34.080
YOU'VE HEARD OF
THE TERRIBLE
PRAIRIE FIRE.

14:34.248 --> 14:35.123
OH, I SEE.

14:35.291 --> 14:36.583
WELL, I'M TERRIBLY
SORRY, CHILD,

14:36.750 --> 14:38.376
BUT YOU'VE CAUGHT
ME AT A VERY
AWKWARD TIME.

14:38.544 --> 14:41.713
AS YOU CAN SEE,
THE SHELVES ARE
PRACTICALLY BARE.

14:41.881 --> 14:45.884
WE'RE NOT ASKING YOU
TO GIVE ANYTHING,
MRS. OLESON.

14:46.051 --> 14:47.886
OH. NOTHING?

14:48.053 --> 14:49.929
NO.

14:50.097 --> 14:52.515
IN FACT, WE WONDERED
IF YOU'D MIND.

14:52.683 --> 14:54.601
YOU SEE, WE'RE GOING
TO NEED A PLACE
TO STORE THE THINGS

14:54.768 --> 14:56.311
BROTHER HODGEKISS
AND I COLLECT.

14:56.478 --> 14:59.022
WE WONDERED
IF YOU COULD RENT
PART OF THIS ROOM.

14:59.189 --> 15:01.232
RENT? DID
YOU SAY RENT?

15:01.400 --> 15:02.692
THAT WAY, YOU
COULD CONSIDER
THE RENTAL

15:02.860 --> 15:04.861
PART OF YOUR DONATION
TO THE DRIVE.

15:05.029 --> 15:07.071
I MEAN, IF YOU WERE
TO ASK, SAY, $50

15:07.239 --> 15:09.032
FOR THE RENT ON THE ROOM,
WE COULD ENTER THAT $50

15:09.199 --> 15:10.450
IN THE LEDGER
AS YOUR DONATION,

15:10.618 --> 15:13.036
AND PEOPLE AROUND
WOULD BE TERRIBLY
IMPRESSED.

15:13.203 --> 15:15.455
OH. $50! MY!

15:15.623 --> 15:20.043
THAT SEEMS LIKE
A VERY LARGE
DONATION TO CHARITY.

15:20.210 --> 15:23.254
I DON'T RECALL
ANOTHER GIFT THAT SIZE
IN THIS WHOLE COUNTY.

15:23.422 --> 15:24.422
AH...

15:24.590 --> 15:26.299
UM, IS THAT
THE LIST?

15:26.467 --> 15:28.009
-UH-HUH.
-MAY I?

15:32.222 --> 15:35.558
AH! MR. SPRAGUE IS
ONLY GIVING $30?

15:35.726 --> 15:38.811
HE'S TEMPORARILY
STRAPPED FOR FUNDS.

15:38.979 --> 15:42.190
OH, I SEE.

15:42.358 --> 15:45.568
PUT THE RENTAL
DOWN FOR $60.

15:45.736 --> 15:47.111
THE LEAST I CAN DO
IS TO CONTRIBUTE

15:47.279 --> 15:49.197
TWICE AS MUCH
AS THE TOWN BANKER.

15:49.365 --> 15:51.824
THAT'S VERY
GENEROUS OF YOU.

15:51.992 --> 15:53.284
I KNOW.

15:54.119 --> 15:55.078
NOT A WORD TO
THE MISSUS NOW.

15:55.245 --> 15:56.412
NOT A WORD,
THANK YOU.

15:56.580 --> 15:58.456
GOD BLESS YOUR
GOOD WORK, BROTHER
HODGEKISS.

15:58.624 --> 16:00.750
THANK YOU AGAIN,
MRS. OLESON.

16:00.918 --> 16:02.794
-GOOD DAY.
-GOOD DAY.

16:05.923 --> 16:08.466
OH, IT'S DISGRACEFUL,
THAT TOWN BANKER

16:08.634 --> 16:11.344
GIVING SUCH
A SMALL DONATION.

16:11.512 --> 16:13.429
WELL, I DARESAY
THEY WILL NAME

16:13.597 --> 16:16.307
A PEW AFTER ME
IN THE CHURCH.

16:17.559 --> 16:19.394
NOW I KNOW WHY THEY
CALL IT A PEW.

16:19.561 --> 16:20.603
Mrs. Oleson:
WHAT, NELS?

16:20.771 --> 16:22.981
I SAID YOU'RE VERY
GENEROUS, DEAR.

16:34.284 --> 16:35.994
WILL HE GET
BETTER, DOCTOR?

16:37.204 --> 16:39.455
I HOPE SO, ALICIA.

16:39.623 --> 16:40.957
YOU JUST KEEP GIVING
HIM THE MEDICINE.

16:41.125 --> 16:43.292
WE'LL JUST HAVE
TO WAIT AND SEE.

16:47.506 --> 16:50.174
Mary:
HI, DOC BAKER!

16:50.342 --> 16:51.718
HELLO, MARY.

16:55.639 --> 16:59.058
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOUR PUP,
ALICIA?

16:59.226 --> 17:01.102
HE'S BAD SICK.

17:01.270 --> 17:02.603
HE SHOULDN'T DIE.

17:02.771 --> 17:04.731
HE'S JUST A PUPPY.

17:11.488 --> 17:14.157
YOU MUST BE
THE BROTHER HODGEKISS
I'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT.

17:14.324 --> 17:15.408
I'M DOC BAKER.

17:15.576 --> 17:18.578
MY PLEASURE, DOCTOR.

17:18.746 --> 17:20.455
I KNOW YOU MEET UP
WITH THAT IN
YOUR WORK, TOO,

17:20.622 --> 17:23.082
BUT I'LL NEVER
GET USED TO IT.

17:23.250 --> 17:24.917
I KNOW HE'S ONLY
A PUP, BUT...

17:25.085 --> 17:27.086
I UNDERSTAND.

17:27.254 --> 17:28.421
HOW'S THE COLLECTION
COMING?

17:28.589 --> 17:30.006
JUST FINE,
THANK YOU.

17:30.174 --> 17:33.176
YOU'RE WELCOME TO ALL
THE MEDICAL SUPPLIES
I CAN SPARE.

17:33.343 --> 17:34.594
I'M AFRAID
MY READY CASH
AT THE MOMENT

17:34.762 --> 17:36.679
CONSISTS OF ONE BAG
OF POTATOES AND 3 HAMS,

17:36.847 --> 17:38.097
BUT YOU'RE
WELCOME TO THEM.

17:38.265 --> 17:39.640
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

17:39.808 --> 17:41.434
BUT I'D LIKE
A FAVOR FROM YOU.

17:41.602 --> 17:43.186
OF COURSE.

17:43.353 --> 17:44.771
IF SOMEONE'S
LOOKING FOR ME, MARY,

17:44.938 --> 17:46.355
I'LL BE WITH
MRS. BJORNESEN.

17:46.523 --> 17:47.857
ALL RIGHT.

17:48.859 --> 17:50.443
SHE LIVES ON
THE EDGE OF TOWN.

17:50.611 --> 17:51.861
HER HUSBAND
DIED A MONTH AGO,

17:52.029 --> 17:54.530
AND SHE'S DOING HER BEST
TO CATCH UP WITH HIM.

17:57.868 --> 17:59.368
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

17:59.536 --> 18:01.704
THAT'LL BE
DR. BAKER.

18:01.872 --> 18:04.040
NOW YOU'LL
GET WHAT FOR.

18:06.543 --> 18:08.753
SHE WON'T TAKE
HER MEDICINE.

18:10.964 --> 18:13.257
MORNING, ADDIE.

18:13.425 --> 18:15.426
I BROUGHT
A VISITOR FOR YOU.

18:18.388 --> 18:20.848
HIS NAME IS HODGEKISS,
BROTHER HODGEKISS.

18:21.016 --> 18:23.059
HE'S COME A LONG WAY
TO DO A GREAT HELP

18:23.227 --> 18:25.353
TO A GREAT NUMBER
OF PEOPLE.

18:25.521 --> 18:27.522
HE WANTS TO
TALK TO YOU.

18:58.303 --> 19:00.138
IF YOU'VE COME
TO PRAY FOR ME,

19:00.305 --> 19:04.267
YOU CAN SAVE
YOUR BREATH.

19:04.434 --> 19:08.229
WELL, IF I WAS TO PRAY,
I WOULDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO PRAY FOR.

19:08.397 --> 19:10.356
YOU'D HAVE TO
DO THE ASKING.

19:10.524 --> 19:12.191
I'VE ASKED.

19:12.359 --> 19:14.360
IT DON'T COME.

19:14.528 --> 19:16.404
AND DON'T TELL ME
MY JOE'S A-GONNA BE

19:16.572 --> 19:19.615
WAITING FOR ME
AT THE PEARLY GATES.

19:21.952 --> 19:23.953
WELL, I NEVER PUT
A LOT OF STOCK
IN THE PEARLY GATES.

19:24.121 --> 19:29.041
IT ALWAYS SEEMED LIKE
A BUNCH OF FROUFROU TO ME.

19:29.209 --> 19:31.502
WELL, YOU GOT
SOME SASS IN YOU,

19:31.670 --> 19:34.088
I'LL SAY THAT FOR YOU.

19:34.256 --> 19:36.257
ARE YOU A REGULAR
PREACHER?

19:38.427 --> 19:41.679
WELL, I DON'T
REALLY PREACH.
I JUST DO WHAT I CAN.

19:41.847 --> 19:43.639
THE CALLING
CAME RECENTLY.

19:43.807 --> 19:45.558
WHAT WAS YOU BEFORE?

19:45.726 --> 19:47.643
UH, A TRAVELING MAN.

19:47.811 --> 19:51.147
I KNEW IT. NEED
SASS FOR THAT.

19:51.315 --> 19:54.901
OH, MY JOE, HE
HAD SASS IN HIM.

19:55.068 --> 19:56.694
THAT WAS
THE FUN OF IT.

19:56.862 --> 20:01.324
NEVER KNOWING
WHAT TO EXPECT NEXT.

20:01.491 --> 20:03.659
THAT'S WHAT'S MISSING.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.789
TELL ME ABOUT HIM.

20:08.957 --> 20:11.667
TELL YOU?
WHAT DO YOU WANT
ME TO TELL YOU?

20:11.835 --> 20:13.211
WHATEVER YOU'D LIKE.

20:15.214 --> 20:17.006
OH, JOE.

20:17.174 --> 20:19.133
HE HAD A TASTE
FOR HIS NIP,

20:19.301 --> 20:21.427
AND HE HAD
A ROVING EYE.

20:21.595 --> 20:25.723
BUT HIS EYES ALWAYS
COME BACK TO ME.

20:25.891 --> 20:28.267
HE'D BEEN ALL OVER,

20:28.435 --> 20:30.728
DONE EVERYTHING,

20:30.896 --> 20:33.773
DONE TIME
IN JAIL, EVEN.

20:33.941 --> 20:35.733
DOES THAT SHOCK YOU?

20:35.901 --> 20:37.151
DONE IT MYSELF.

20:37.319 --> 20:40.321
OH, YOU'RE SPOOFING ME.

20:40.489 --> 20:41.822
WOULDN'T DO THAT.

20:41.990 --> 20:45.701
AND LOOK AT YOU NOW.

20:45.869 --> 20:48.204
EVER BEEN TO SEA?

20:48.372 --> 20:49.622
7 YEARS.

20:49.790 --> 20:54.168
FROM THE TIME I WAS 11
TILL I JUMPED SHIP
IN NEW ORLEANS.

20:54.336 --> 20:56.379
LIKE JOE.

20:56.546 --> 20:59.090
OH, JOE LOVED
HIS CHANTEYS.

20:59.258 --> 21:03.219
HE'D SING THEM TILL
THE ROOF FELL DOWN.

21:03.387 --> 21:04.387
WHAT WAS HIS FAVORITE?

21:04.554 --> 21:07.306
OH, YOU PROBABLY
WOULDN'T KNOW IT.

21:07.474 --> 21:08.975
TRY ME.

21:13.146 --> 21:14.480
YEAH.

21:19.069 --> 21:21.821

21:53.895 --> 21:57.940
OH! OH, I'VE
HAD ABOUT ENOUGH
FOR NOW, BROTHER.

21:58.108 --> 22:02.153
BUT YOU COME BACK
AND SEE ME AGAIN
REAL SOON, HEAR?

22:02.321 --> 22:03.738
I WILL, ADDIE.

22:04.781 --> 22:06.574
YOU'RE NOT
JUST TALKING?

22:06.742 --> 22:08.117
YOU'LL COME?

22:10.787 --> 22:12.705
I'LL BE BACK, ADDIE.

22:17.794 --> 22:23.299
[Softly]   OH, MY BONNIE
LIES OVER THE OCEAN

22:23.467 --> 22:28.387
MY BONNIE LIES

MY BONNIE LIES
OVER THE OCEAN

22:33.643 --> 22:38.814
OH, BRING BACK
MY BONNIE TO ME

22:41.818 --> 22:45.196
MAY WHIPPLE,
WHY ARE YOU
SITTING OUT THERE?

22:45.364 --> 22:46.989
HA HA HA HA!

22:47.157 --> 22:49.367
-HOW DID YOU DO IT?
-I DON'T REALLY KNOW.

22:49.534 --> 22:51.952
WELL, THERE WASN'T
A SOUL IN TOWN
THAT COULD ROUSE HER.

22:52.120 --> 22:54.497
SHE WAS DYING, AND
SHE WANTED TO DIE.

22:54.664 --> 22:57.166
THE LORD MUST BE SPEAKING
THROUGH YOU, BROTHER.

22:57.334 --> 22:58.584
I SUPPOSE SO.

22:58.752 --> 23:00.503
WELL, I'D BETTER GO.

23:02.381 --> 23:04.840
BROTHER HODGEKISS!

23:05.008 --> 23:06.384
GOD BLESS YOU.

23:35.038 --> 23:36.956
[COUGHING]

23:51.221 --> 23:52.430
YOU LOOK A SIGHT
MORE HUMAN.

23:52.597 --> 23:54.098
HOW YOU FEEL?

23:54.266 --> 23:55.766
BETTER.

23:55.934 --> 23:58.060
DON'T ASK ME TO
MOVE ANY MOUNTAINS.

23:58.228 --> 24:00.020
WELL, YOUR
FEVER'S DOWN.

24:00.188 --> 24:03.732
THINK YOU CAN
HOLD SOMETHING
ON YOUR STOMACH?

24:03.900 --> 24:05.276
I'LL GIVE IT A TRY.

24:13.577 --> 24:15.453
WHAT DAY IS THIS?

24:15.620 --> 24:17.872
IT'S FRIDAY.

24:18.039 --> 24:19.498
IS HE BACK YET?

24:19.666 --> 24:21.000
CALEB?

24:21.168 --> 24:23.002
YOU DON'T
REMEMBER, DO YA?

24:26.548 --> 24:28.424
HE'S STAYING
IN WALNUT GROVE

24:28.592 --> 24:30.634
TO HELP WITH
THE COLLECTING.

24:33.180 --> 24:36.182
HE'S SUPPOSED
TO MEET YOU IN
GRAY'S CORNERS

24:36.349 --> 24:38.434
WITH WHAT
HE'S TAKEN IN,

24:38.602 --> 24:40.603
SATURDAY, IF
YOU CAN MAKE IT.

24:40.770 --> 24:42.313
I'LL MAKE IT.

24:47.360 --> 24:48.819
HOW LONG HAVE
I BEEN HERE?

24:52.157 --> 24:55.951
I DON'T REMEMBER
IF YOU CAME
MONDAY OR TUESDAY.

24:56.119 --> 24:58.996
AND ALL THAT TIME,
YOU'VE BEEN DOING FOR ME.

25:00.457 --> 25:02.958
NURSING, FOOD.

25:05.462 --> 25:10.049
YOU KNOW, IN GOD'S EYES,
YOU SAVED MY LIFE.

25:10.217 --> 25:11.759
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO THANK YOU.

25:11.927 --> 25:13.135
WELL, THEN DON'T!

25:13.303 --> 25:15.638
I DON'T NEED YOUR THANKS!

25:21.937 --> 25:23.729
I NEED SOME
FIREWOOD.

25:28.068 --> 25:29.443
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE IT?

25:29.611 --> 25:30.528
THERE'S MORE COMING, TOO.

25:30.695 --> 25:32.154
OH, THAT'S WONDERFUL.

25:32.322 --> 25:35.991
I'LL WRITE A PERSONAL
LETTER OF THANKS
TO EVERYONE THAT GAVE.

25:36.159 --> 25:37.618
YOU KNOW,
BROTHER HODGEKISS,

25:37.786 --> 25:38.911
I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT I'M A MAN

25:39.079 --> 25:40.746
WHO TRUSTS
PEOPLE BY NATURE.

25:40.914 --> 25:42.623
BUT THERE'S SO MUCH
PILING UP IN HERE

25:42.791 --> 25:45.167
THAT I'D HATE TO THINK
THAT SOMEBODY MIGHT
TAKE IT INTO HIS HEAD

25:45.335 --> 25:47.086
TO MAKE OFF
WITH ANY OF IT.

25:48.129 --> 25:50.965
NO ONE WOULD DO THAT.
YOU MUST BE JOKING.

25:51.132 --> 25:53.217
I WISH I WAS.

25:53.385 --> 25:54.593
WHEN THE BANKS
ARE CLOSED,

25:54.761 --> 25:57.513
THERE'S
A HEAP OF MONEY
IN THIS CASH BOX.

25:57.681 --> 25:59.848
THAT'S WHY I'VE
BEEN LOCKING UP.

26:00.016 --> 26:01.141
HERE'S AN EXTRA KEY.

26:01.309 --> 26:02.518
IT'S THE SAME ONE
THAT OPENS THE SHOP,

26:02.686 --> 26:04.853
SO BE CAREFUL
WITH IT.

26:05.021 --> 26:06.397
I CERTAINLY WILL.

26:10.026 --> 26:11.652
-GOOD MORNING.
Mr. Oleson:
MORNING, MARY.

26:11.820 --> 26:13.070
-HI.
-HI.

26:13.238 --> 26:14.446
HERE'S SOME THINGS
MY MA GAVE.

26:14.614 --> 26:15.864
SHE WISHED IT WAS MORE.

26:16.032 --> 26:18.200
AW, THAT'S
VERY GENEROUS.

26:18.368 --> 26:20.494
NOW, WHAT ARE OUR PLANS
FOR TODAY, YOUNG LADY?

26:20.662 --> 26:22.538
WE'VE GOT A LOT
OF PLACES TO GO.

26:22.706 --> 26:25.833
THIS PLACE IS GOING
TO BE BUSTING AT
THE SEAMS BY SUNDAY.

26:26.001 --> 26:27.418
SATURDAY, MR. OLESON.

26:27.586 --> 26:28.335
SATURDAY.

26:28.503 --> 26:29.795
I PROMISED REVEREND ALDEN

26:29.963 --> 26:32.381
I'D MEET HIM
AT GRAY'S CORNERS
ON SATURDAY.

26:32.549 --> 26:34.925
BUT THERE WILL BE
A LOT MORE PLEDGES
COMING IN.

26:35.093 --> 26:36.510
AND THE FOLKS ARE
GOING TO WANT TO
HEAR YOU SAY

26:36.678 --> 26:37.886
THE BLESSING
ON SUNDAY.

26:38.054 --> 26:39.722
PEOPLE GIVE MORE
ON SUNDAY.

26:39.889 --> 26:41.473
I'M AFRAID SHE'S RIGHT.

26:43.643 --> 26:45.185
I SUPPOSE.

26:45.353 --> 26:46.687
SEE YOU, MR. OLESON.

26:46.855 --> 26:48.939
RIGHT, BROTHER
HODGEKISS.

26:49.107 --> 26:51.400
Mary: AND MRS. WHIPPLE
GAVE 3 BOLTS OF
UNBLEACHED MUSLIN,

26:51.568 --> 26:53.027
AND MR. HANSON GAVE
4 SACKS OF MEAL,

26:53.194 --> 26:54.194
AND MORE PROMISED
SUNDAY.

26:54.362 --> 26:55.946
[LAUGHS]
AND THE PEABODY
SISTERS--

26:56.114 --> 26:58.115
AND THEY'RE THE ONES
THAT LIVE IN THAT
FINE OLD HOUSE, RIGHT?

26:58.283 --> 26:59.700
-UH-HUH.
-WHAT'D THEY GIVE?

26:59.868 --> 27:01.785
2 CHIPPED CUPS
AND A PLATTER.

27:01.953 --> 27:03.078
HAVE YOU NOTICED?

27:03.246 --> 27:04.371
THE ONES THAT
DON'T HAVE MUCH,

27:04.539 --> 27:05.914
THEY GIVE THE MOST.

27:06.082 --> 27:08.250
WELL, I WOULDN'T
SAY THAT'S TRUE
IN EVERY CASE.

27:08.418 --> 27:09.710
DARN NEAR.

27:09.878 --> 27:11.420
I BET I KNOW WHY.

27:11.588 --> 27:14.465
BECAUSE THEY KNOW
WHAT IT MEANS TO NEED
AND NOT TO HAVE.

27:14.633 --> 27:17.801
MARY, YOU KNOW
IF THIS SUIT FIT YOU,
I'D LET YOU WEAR IT.

27:17.969 --> 27:19.094
I DECLARE,
YOU'RE DIFFERENT

27:19.262 --> 27:21.472
FROM ANY PREACHER
I EVER KNEW.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.432
YEAH, I SUPPOSE I AM.

27:29.522 --> 27:30.689
Mary: HELLO,
MR. EDWARDS!

27:30.857 --> 27:32.191
HOWDY!

27:34.319 --> 27:35.944
COME COLLECTING,
DID YOU?

27:36.112 --> 27:38.405
WELL, THE WIFE'S GOT
SOME STUFF PILED UP
IN THE KITCHEN FOR YOU.

27:38.573 --> 27:39.615
THANK YOU.

27:39.783 --> 27:40.908
WHERE'S ALICIA?

27:41.076 --> 27:42.826
OH, SHE'S IN THE BARN.

27:42.994 --> 27:44.870
SOMETHING SAD HAPPENED.

27:45.038 --> 27:47.122
HER PUP?

27:47.290 --> 27:48.666
AFRAID SO.

27:49.709 --> 27:51.418
I'LL GO SEE HER.

27:57.634 --> 27:58.967
DIGGING A GRAVE
FOR THAT PUP.

27:59.135 --> 28:00.427
JUST DOESN'T WANT
TO PUT HIM IN IT.

28:00.595 --> 28:03.472
KEEPS PRAYING HE'LL
COME TO LIFE AGAIN.

28:03.640 --> 28:05.182
BROTHER HODGEKISS, I
KNOW IT'S A LOT TO ASK,

28:05.350 --> 28:06.809
BUT I WAS WONDERING
IF MAYBE YOU COULD SAY

28:06.976 --> 28:08.352
A FEW WORDS OF
COMFORT TO ALICIA?

28:08.520 --> 28:09.728
SURE WOULD
APPRECIATE IT.

28:09.896 --> 28:11.355
-WELL...
-PLEASE NOW,

28:11.523 --> 28:13.315
I'M NOT MUCH OF
A ONE WITH WORDS.

28:13.483 --> 28:15.818
WOULDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY TO HER.

28:15.985 --> 28:16.985
ALL RIGHT.

28:17.153 --> 28:18.570
OH, THANK YOU,
THANK YOU.

28:47.517 --> 28:49.685
WHAT'S YOUR
PUPPY'S NAME?

28:49.853 --> 28:52.521
"MINE."

28:52.689 --> 28:54.565
GOOD NAME FOR A DOG.

28:56.901 --> 28:58.026
YOU KNOW, YOU
WERE REALLY LUCKY

28:58.194 --> 29:00.446
HAVING A DOG
LOVE YOU LIKE THAT.

29:00.613 --> 29:03.657
BECAUSE A LOT OF
PEOPLE GO THROUGH
THEIR WHOLE LIFE

29:03.825 --> 29:07.536
AND NEVER HAVE
ANYBODY TO LOVE THEM.

29:07.704 --> 29:10.914
BUT YOU KNOW,
THERE'S AN END
TO EVERYTHING.

29:11.082 --> 29:13.292
EVEN US.

29:13.460 --> 29:15.335
BUT WE GO TO HEAVEN.

29:15.503 --> 29:19.047
WE GET TO SEE
EACH OTHER AGAIN.

29:19.215 --> 29:21.842
BUT I'LL NEVER
SEE MINE AGAIN.

29:22.010 --> 29:24.011
WHY NOT?

29:24.179 --> 29:27.431
BECAUSE ONLY PEOPLE
GO TO HEAVEN.

29:27.599 --> 29:31.435
AND MINE'S
JUST A PUPPY.

29:31.603 --> 29:33.729
HOLD ON THERE NOW.

29:33.897 --> 29:37.816
SEEMS TO ME LIKE
I REMEMBER READING
SOMETHING IN THE BIBLE

29:37.984 --> 29:40.068
WHERE GOD TOLD--
FIRST THERE WAS

29:40.236 --> 29:43.071
A WHOLE BUNCH OF
RAIN FALLING, RIGHT?

29:43.239 --> 29:46.825
AND THEN GOD TOLD
A MAN NAMED JONAH

29:46.993 --> 29:49.244
TO BUILD A BIG BOAT

29:49.412 --> 29:50.913
AND, UH...

29:51.080 --> 29:54.082
YOU MEAN NOAH,
THE ONE WHO
BUILT THE ARK?

29:54.250 --> 29:55.501
NOAH. THAT'S RIGHT.
I JUST WANTED TO SEE

29:55.668 --> 29:58.378
IF YOU REMEMBERED
YOUR BIBLE.

29:58.546 --> 30:01.089
ANYWAY, NOAH--NOAH
BUILT THIS ARK.

30:01.257 --> 30:05.344
AND THEN--AND THEN GOD
HAD ALL THESE ANIMALS

30:05.512 --> 30:07.179
PUT ON THIS ARK.

30:07.347 --> 30:09.932
AND I BETCHA THERE WERE
DOGS ON THERE, TOO.

30:10.099 --> 30:11.141
THINK SO?

30:11.309 --> 30:13.519
THINK SO? KNOW SO.

30:13.686 --> 30:15.562
I'M A PREACHER,
AIN'T I?

30:15.730 --> 30:17.731
ANYWAY, YOU KNOW,
WHAT WITH GOD

30:17.899 --> 30:19.274
TAKING CARE
OF ALL THOSE

30:19.442 --> 30:21.401
DOGS LIKE THAT,

30:21.569 --> 30:24.112
YOU CAN JUST BE
SURE THAT HE'D WANT
A PRETTY LITTLE PUPPY

30:24.280 --> 30:27.991
LIKE YOURS
WITH HIM IN HEAVEN.

30:28.159 --> 30:30.285
THEN I'LL SEE
"MINE" AGAIN?

30:30.453 --> 30:32.955
YOU SURE WILL.

30:33.122 --> 30:34.790
BUT YOU KNOW
WHAT WE GOT TO DO?

30:34.958 --> 30:36.625
FIRST THING,
WE GOT TO GET
YOUR PUPPY BURIED

30:36.793 --> 30:39.294
SO HE CAN GO TO HEAVEN.

30:39.462 --> 30:40.796
ALL RIGHT.

30:52.141 --> 30:53.642
GOD BLESS YOU.

31:34.684 --> 31:37.269
KIND OF RUSHING THINGS,
AREN'T YOU, REVEREND?

31:37.437 --> 31:39.021
IT'S SATURDAY,
ISN'T IT?

31:39.188 --> 31:42.149
WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO BE OUT OF HERE
TILL NOON.

31:43.568 --> 31:45.485
MATTIE, WHERE
ARE MY CLOTHES?

31:45.653 --> 31:48.363
RIGHT IN FRONT
OF YOU, ON THE WALL.

31:48.531 --> 31:50.657
I PRESSED
YOUR FROCKED COAT
AND YOUR TROUSERS,

31:50.825 --> 31:54.202
AND YOUR LINENS
ALL FRESHLY DONE.

31:54.370 --> 31:55.495
BUT THE CLOTHES
IN MY BAG,

31:55.663 --> 31:58.916
MY SHOES, MY HAT...

31:59.083 --> 32:01.251
MY CLOTHES, MATTIE,
WHERE ARE THEY?

32:02.378 --> 32:04.171
I HEARD YA.

32:04.339 --> 32:05.422
UH...

32:05.590 --> 32:06.924
YOU'LL GET THEM BACK.

32:07.091 --> 32:08.508
I PROMISE YOU.

32:11.971 --> 32:15.390
YOUR HUSBAND HAS THEM.

32:15.558 --> 32:16.850
WHY?

32:18.728 --> 32:23.690
WELL, FOLKS WILL BE
MORE GENEROUS TO
A MAN OF THE CLOTH.

32:23.858 --> 32:25.609
THEY GIVE MORE.

32:25.777 --> 32:27.903
YOU KNOW
FOR YOURSELF
THEY DO.

32:28.071 --> 32:29.821
IT IMPRESSES THEM.

32:42.543 --> 32:45.587
I SUPPOSE HE'S
IMPRESSING THEM
WITH MY WATCH?

32:48.091 --> 32:51.635
MATTIE, I DON'T
UNDERSTAND.

32:51.803 --> 32:54.763
YOUR KINDNESS...

32:54.931 --> 32:56.473
YOUR GOODNESS...

32:56.641 --> 32:58.058
DON'T TRY.

33:00.144 --> 33:03.480
MATTIE, I DON'T CARE
ABOUT THE WATCH
OR THE CLOTHES.

33:05.358 --> 33:06.942
HE'S TAKING
FROM POOR PEOPLE.

33:07.110 --> 33:09.111
HE'S TAKING
FOR THE NEEDY!

33:09.278 --> 33:11.488
LORD KNOWS,
WE'RE NEEDY!

33:14.200 --> 33:15.617
YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT.

33:30.299 --> 33:32.592
DON'T FRET YOURSELF.

33:35.138 --> 33:38.098
YOUR PRECIOUS NEEDY
WILL GET THEIR THINGS.

33:41.185 --> 33:47.065
I'M SUPPOSED TO HAVE YOU
OUT OF HERE BY NOON TODAY...

33:47.233 --> 33:50.027
GOING TO GRAY'S CORNERS...

33:50.194 --> 33:53.405
WITH A STORY THAT
HE'D MEET YOU THERE.

33:53.573 --> 33:56.199
HE WAS GOING TO BRING
EVERYTHING HE COLLECTED,

33:56.367 --> 33:57.492
ONLY HE WASN'T GOING THERE.

33:57.660 --> 33:59.661
HE WAS COMING HERE.

34:05.418 --> 34:06.752
AND...

34:09.714 --> 34:13.675
BY THE TIME
THEY FOUND US...

34:13.843 --> 34:16.011
IT'S TOO LATE, SEE?

34:19.265 --> 34:21.391
BUT HE'S STILL
COMING HERE.

34:21.559 --> 34:24.811
AND YOU CAN STILL
GET YOUR THINGS.

34:24.979 --> 34:27.689
ALL YOU HAVE
TO DO IS JUST...

34:27.857 --> 34:31.485
WAIT FOR HIM AND TAKE
THEM AWAY FROM HIM.

34:34.155 --> 34:35.530
ONLY...

34:38.076 --> 34:41.953
DON'T TURN HIM IN,
REVEREND.

34:42.121 --> 34:44.039
PLEASE DON'T
TURN HIM IN.

34:45.541 --> 34:48.418
SUPPOSE HE GETS IT
IN HIS HEAD
NOT TO COME BACK?

34:50.129 --> 34:51.254
WHAT IF HE TURNS
HIS BACK ON YOU

34:51.422 --> 34:54.800
AND DECIDES TO
KEEP IT ALL HIMSELF?

34:54.967 --> 34:56.635
HE WOULDN'T.

34:58.721 --> 35:01.098
HE'LL BE HERE.

35:01.265 --> 35:04.893
YOU JUST
WAIT AND SEE.

35:05.061 --> 35:06.686
HE'LL BE HERE.

35:23.371 --> 35:25.288
DOOR'S OPEN.

35:27.375 --> 35:29.793
WELL, IT'S ABOUT TIME
YOU GOT HERE, BROTHER.

35:29.961 --> 35:31.086
WHEN I SEND
TO FETCH SOMEONE,

35:31.254 --> 35:33.380
I EXPECT TO SEE THEM
THE SAME DAY.

35:33.548 --> 35:35.799
YES, MISS ADDIE.

35:35.967 --> 35:37.551
NOW, THAT BAG OVER THERE.

35:37.718 --> 35:40.220
I WANT YOU TO ADD IT
TO THE COLLECTION.

35:40.388 --> 35:41.721
IT'S JOE'S THINGS.

35:41.889 --> 35:43.306
MAY HELPED ME.

35:43.474 --> 35:45.642
MOST OF THEM HAVE GOT
A FEW YEAR'S WEAR
OR MORE IN THEM,

35:45.810 --> 35:49.020
AND HE AIN'T
LIKELY TO NEED THEM.

35:54.443 --> 35:57.404
I BURIED HIM,
FINALLY.

35:57.572 --> 35:59.114
THANK YOU, ADDIE.

36:03.369 --> 36:04.953
BROTHER?

36:05.121 --> 36:07.289
YOU TELL THEM DOWN
AT GRAY'S CORNERS

36:07.456 --> 36:10.542
THAT I DON'T WANT
NO MEALY MOUTH
A-WEARIN' THEM.

36:10.710 --> 36:13.837
I WANT THEM TO GO
TO SOMEBODY LIKE YOU.

36:14.005 --> 36:15.964
WHY, YOU'RE
MORE LIKE HIM

36:16.132 --> 36:19.509
EVERY TIME I
SET EYES ON YOU.

36:19.677 --> 36:21.720
I WANT YOU TO
PROMISE SOMETHING.

36:21.888 --> 36:23.305
AFORE YOU GO
TOMORROW,

36:23.472 --> 36:24.973
YOU STOP BY.

36:25.141 --> 36:28.143
YOU GIVE ME
A GOOD-BYE. HEAR?

37:07.516 --> 37:09.142
BROTHER HODGEKISS.

37:09.310 --> 37:11.019
AHA. IT'S YOU.

37:11.187 --> 37:13.021
THOUGHT I HEARD
SOMEBODY MOVING AROUND.

37:13.189 --> 37:14.856
GUESS YOU AND ME
HAD THE SAME IDEA, HUH?

37:15.024 --> 37:17.692
CHECKING TO SEE
THAT EVERYTHING'S
LOCKED UP TIGHT.

37:17.860 --> 37:19.319
YEAH, I WAS
JUST MAKING SURE.

37:19.487 --> 37:21.321
BE LEAVING RIGHT
AFTER SERVICES
TOMORROW?

37:22.865 --> 37:23.949
MM-HMM.

37:24.116 --> 37:27.452
BUSY AS YOU'LL BE
TOMORROW, I'D, UH...

37:27.620 --> 37:28.703
WELL, I'D LIKE
TO THANK YOU

37:28.871 --> 37:30.497
FOR WHAT YOU'VE
DONE FOR US.

37:34.210 --> 37:35.669
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

37:35.836 --> 37:38.004
OH, YES, YOU DID.

37:38.172 --> 37:41.007
YOU GAVE US
A CHANCE TO HELP.

37:41.175 --> 37:44.052
I KNOW IT'S PROBABLY
HARD FOR YOU
TO UNDERSTAND.

37:44.220 --> 37:45.762
A MAN LIKE YOURSELF,

37:45.930 --> 37:49.391
YOU SPEND
YOUR WHOLE LIFE
DOING FOR OTHERS.

37:49.558 --> 37:51.851
BUT FOR US...

37:52.019 --> 37:53.812
THAT CHANCE
MEANT A LOT.

37:53.980 --> 37:55.605
AND I WANT TO
THANK YOU FOR IT.

38:06.867 --> 38:08.243
MR. OLESON,
THAT OLD HOUND
OF YOURS

38:08.411 --> 38:10.537
IS ABOUT READY
TO WHELP, ISN'T SHE?

38:10.705 --> 38:12.080
ANY MINUTE.

38:14.125 --> 38:15.750
DO ME A FAVOR,

38:15.918 --> 38:20.422
AND GIVE ONE OF
THE PUPS TO ALICIA,
WOULD YOU?

38:20.589 --> 38:23.091
BE GLAD TO.

38:23.259 --> 38:24.759
THANK YOU.

38:26.846 --> 38:28.763
WE GET THIS CANVAS ON,
WE'LL BE ALL SET.

38:28.931 --> 38:30.932
JUST HANG THAT UP
ANYWHERE, MARY.
THANK YOU.

38:31.100 --> 38:32.809
YES, SIR.

38:32.977 --> 38:35.103
-GOING TO BE
ANOTHER HOT ONE.
-SURE IS.

38:35.271 --> 38:36.354
THOUGHT I'D RIDE
PARTWAY WITH YOU

38:36.522 --> 38:38.648
TO GRAY'S CORNERS,
KEEP YOU COMPANY.

38:38.816 --> 38:40.775
UH, THAT WON'T
BE NECESSARY.

38:40.943 --> 38:43.194
NOT NECESSARY.
IT'D BE MY PLEASURE.

38:43.362 --> 38:45.989
WELL, I APPRECIATE
THE THOUGHT, BUT I
CAN MANAGE ALL RIGHT.

38:46.157 --> 38:47.699
SUIT YOURSELF.

39:12.725 --> 39:14.476
WELL, THAT
ABOUT DOES IT.

39:14.643 --> 39:17.270
THAT'S THE MIGHTIEST
PARCEL OF GIVING
I'VE EVER SEEN.

39:17.438 --> 39:18.480
WHAT SAY WE
GET TO CHURCH?
COME ON, MARY.

39:18.647 --> 39:19.981
IN A MINUTE.

39:20.149 --> 39:22.317
ALL RIGHT. I'LL
SAVE A SEAT FOR YOU.
SEE YOU IN CHURCH.

39:22.485 --> 39:24.235
I'LL GO WITH
YOU, MARY.

39:41.212 --> 39:42.921
FELL OUT OF
YOUR POCKET.

39:53.391 --> 39:55.141
HOPE IT'S NOT BROKEN.

39:57.645 --> 39:59.479
NO, IT SEEMS
TO BE ALL RIGHT.

39:59.647 --> 40:01.231
IT'S THE REVEREND
ALDEN'S WATCH.

40:01.399 --> 40:03.483
OF COURSE IT IS.
DIDN'T I TELL YOU?

40:03.651 --> 40:05.360
HE LENT IT TO ME,

40:05.528 --> 40:08.071
SEEING AS I HAD
NONE OF MY OWN.

40:08.239 --> 40:10.615
I WANT TO BE SURE
I GET TO GRAY'S
CORNERS ON TIME,

40:10.783 --> 40:12.534
MORE OR LESS.

40:16.705 --> 40:19.791
THAT'S WHY I WAS
SO WORRIED ABOUT
IT BEING BROKEN.

40:28.884 --> 40:31.386
YOUR FOLKS ARE
WAITING FOR YOU.

40:58.205 --> 41:00.331
[CHATTER]

41:13.095 --> 41:14.471
WHAT'S THE
MATTER, MARY?

41:14.638 --> 41:16.139
NOTHING.

41:24.773 --> 41:26.399
BROTHER HODGEKISS.

41:37.995 --> 41:39.537
Man: IT'S ADDIE.

41:42.500 --> 41:44.292
Second man:
ADDIE.

41:44.460 --> 41:46.836
Third man: I
DIDN'T KNOW SHE
WAS UP AND AROUND.

41:51.967 --> 41:54.344
Woman: THE HAND OF GOD
HAS TOUCHED HER.

42:04.563 --> 42:07.273
I DON'T KNOW NOTHING
ABOUT THE HAND OF GOD.

42:07.441 --> 42:10.151
ALL I KNOW IS
I GOT MY SASS BACK.

42:10.319 --> 42:12.362
AND I KNOW
WHO DONE THAT.

42:14.031 --> 42:16.991
GOD BLESS YOU,
BROTHER HODGEKISS.

42:49.692 --> 42:53.987
I CAN'T DO WHAT I
CAME HERE PREPARED
TO DO TODAY.

42:57.032 --> 42:59.701
I CAN'T, UH,
I CAN'T GIVE YOU

42:59.868 --> 43:01.953
THE SERMON THAT...

43:02.121 --> 43:03.663
THAT I WROTE.

43:20.973 --> 43:23.182
A LOT HAS HAPPENED
TO ME THIS WEEK.

43:23.350 --> 43:27.937
I'VE SEEN GOODNESS
IN PEOPLE'S HEARTS.

43:28.105 --> 43:31.441
AND I'VE SEEN PEOPLE
THAT HAD LITTLE GIVE

43:31.609 --> 43:33.401
BECAUSE OTHERS HAD LESS.

43:35.613 --> 43:37.363
THEY SAY THAT
THE CHURCH LEADS
ITS PEOPLE

43:37.531 --> 43:39.115
IN PATHS OF
RIGHTEOUSNESS,

43:39.283 --> 43:41.951
BUT IT WAS YOU
THAT LED.

43:42.119 --> 43:44.454
IT WAS YOU THAT GAVE.

43:44.622 --> 43:46.039
YOU GAVE, TOO,
BROTHER.

43:50.461 --> 43:52.045
I TOOK.

43:55.966 --> 43:57.508
YOUR WAGON STANDS
LOADED OUTSIDE,

43:57.676 --> 44:00.678
AND YOU SHOULD BE
THE ONES TO TAKE IT
TO GRAY'S CORNERS.

44:00.846 --> 44:02.805
MY WORK HERE
IS FINISHED.

44:04.308 --> 44:05.850
Man: NOT QUITE.

44:08.979 --> 44:10.772
Man: HOW YOU
FEELING, REVEREND?

44:10.939 --> 44:12.857
FINE. THANK YOU, JACK.

44:21.283 --> 44:24.327
I'M GLAD I WAS
PHYSICALLY ABLE
TO GET HERE IN TIME.

44:27.706 --> 44:31.501
I OVERHEARD PART OF
WHAT YOU WERE SAYING.

44:31.669 --> 44:32.960
THERE ARE A FEW THINGS
I'D LIKE TO ADD.

44:33.128 --> 44:34.629
-REVEREND, I--
-DON'T INTERRUPT
A MINISTER

44:34.797 --> 44:37.298
WHEN HE'S TALKING
TO HIS CONGREGATION.

44:39.802 --> 44:41.219
I'D LIKE TO TAKE
THIS OPPORTUNITY

44:41.387 --> 44:43.262
TO THANK BROTHER
HODGEKISS

44:43.430 --> 44:46.641
FOR THE WONDERFUL WORK
HE'S DONE HERE.

44:46.809 --> 44:48.643
AND ALL OF YOU.

44:48.811 --> 44:51.521
YOU'VE BEEN
VERY GENEROUS.

44:51.689 --> 44:56.067
BUT I'VE KNOWN
BROTHER HODGEKISS
HERE FOR--

44:56.235 --> 44:57.568
A WHILE.

44:59.029 --> 45:03.825
AND I CAN TELL YOU
OUT OF PERSONAL
KNOWLEDGE OF THE MAN...

45:03.992 --> 45:07.120
THAT HE'S GIVEN MORE
THAN ANY OF YOU REALIZE.

45:08.664 --> 45:11.624
NOW, I KNOW IT'S NOT
CONSIDERED PROPER,

45:11.792 --> 45:14.210
BUT I THINK THE LORD
WOULD FORGIVE US

45:14.378 --> 45:17.213
IF WE GAVE
BROTHER HODGEKISS
A ROUND OF APPLAUSE.

45:49.705 --> 46:00.006
THANK YOU.

46:07.723 --> 46:08.890
GOD BLESS YOU,
BROTHER.

46:09.057 --> 46:10.349
GOD BLESS YOU.

46:10.517 --> 46:12.059
BLESS YOU.

46:12.227 --> 46:14.604
Man: GOD BLESS YOU,
BROTHER HODGEKISS.

46:23.906 --> 46:25.490
LET'S ALL RISE

46:25.657 --> 46:28.743
WHILE MRS. FOSTER
SINGS THE HYMN
THIS MORNING.

46:31.371 --> 46:35.792
Mrs. Foster:   I
COME TO THE GARDEN

46:35.959 --> 46:39.086
ALONE

46:39.254 --> 46:41.047
WHILE THE DEW

46:41.215 --> 46:46.761
IS STILL ON THE ROSES

46:46.929 --> 46:51.474
AND THE VOICE I HEAR

46:51.642 --> 46:54.393
DIDN'T WORK OUT
LIKE I PLANNED,
MATTIE.

46:57.439 --> 47:00.066
SOMETHING HAPPENED
TO ME IN THERE.

47:03.862 --> 47:06.572
I NEVER HAD ANYTHING
LIKE THAT HAPPEN
TO ME IN MY LIFE.

47:10.869 --> 47:12.995
WE STILL GOT THE NAG
TO RIDE BACK ON

47:13.163 --> 47:16.666
AND THE SHACK
TO GO BACK TO.

47:16.834 --> 47:17.917
YOU WILLING?

47:18.085 --> 47:19.168
I'M WILLING!

47:19.336 --> 47:21.295
CALEB, I'M WILLING.

47:21.463 --> 47:24.757
AND THE JOY WE SHARE

47:24.925 --> 47:30.137
AS WE TARRY THERE

47:30.305 --> 47:32.306
NONE OTHER

47:32.474 --> 47:35.142
HAS EVER

47:35.310 --> 47:38.396
KNOWN

47:38.564 --> 47:42.775
AND THE JOY WE SHARE

47:42.943 --> 47:47.446
AS WE TARRY THERE

47:47.614 --> 47:49.448
NONE...
