WEBVTT

00:12.417 --> 00:12.958
- Previously on "Below Deck"...

00:14.375 --> 00:15.708
- Ashley's on a plane
to Tortola.

00:18.042 --> 00:19.708
- I'm kind of sad.
It's our last charter.

00:19.708 --> 00:22.375
- Did you seriously
just say that?

00:22.375 --> 00:24.792
- I think this is gonna be our
most high-maintenance charter.

00:24.792 --> 00:27.167
- Good life gals!
- Whoo!

00:27.167 --> 00:29.125
- Emily, Emily, Kate.

00:29.125 --> 00:30.958
- You're a little tense, but
you're in good shape, though.

00:30.958 --> 00:32.500
- Our people don't like us.

00:32.500 --> 00:35.542
- I appreciate and love
the blossoming romance

00:35.542 --> 00:38.375
that is Ben and Emily--
Bemily.

00:38.375 --> 00:41.875
I was frustrated that Captain
had to call over the radio

00:41.875 --> 00:43.625
for service.

00:43.625 --> 00:45.542
- Where's my radio?
- No one has your radio, Sierra.

00:45.542 --> 00:47.375
- This is Emily's radio.

00:47.375 --> 00:48.833
This is your radio.

00:48.833 --> 00:50.208
- All right, let's do this.

00:50.208 --> 00:52.042
I have no clue
where this is coming from.

00:52.042 --> 00:53.083
- I'm wasted!

00:53.083 --> 00:54.875
- Whoa!

00:54.875 --> 00:57.333
- There's a panel in the
bathroom that's off the wall.

00:57.333 --> 00:59.083
- What the f---
happened last night?

00:59.083 --> 01:01.417
This is not your personal
f---ing party palace.

01:01.417 --> 01:03.750
- Kate can go f--- herself.

01:03.750 --> 01:05.083
- Wait, do you think
Kate framed us?

01:05.083 --> 01:07.042
- She definitely did this.

01:07.042 --> 01:09.500
- Anytime any charter group
wants to go to the Baths,

01:09.500 --> 01:12.250
they're gonna be off the boat
for a solid three hours.

01:12.250 --> 01:14.375
This is the toilet paper
situation.

01:14.375 --> 01:17.250
I want--need both of you girls
to go vacuum,

01:17.250 --> 01:18.708
to get all the spots
off the mirrors,

01:18.708 --> 01:20.417
make sure all the toilet paper's
filled.

01:20.417 --> 01:24.167
I can be a very bad
bad guy.

01:43.250 --> 01:44.625
The trashes are full.

01:44.625 --> 01:46.750
Three of the rooms have
no toilet paper.

01:46.750 --> 01:49.375
Like, none.
We don't need breaks.

01:49.375 --> 01:50.917
You're not tired
and the job's not done,

01:50.917 --> 01:53.792
clearly, you haven't been
working enough.

02:00.417 --> 02:02.958
- I have worked
so hard this season.

02:02.958 --> 02:06.375
For her to say, like,
that wasn't good enough,

02:06.375 --> 02:08.208
it's bullsh--.

02:10.792 --> 02:12.458
- It's the pimp wagon.

02:12.458 --> 02:14.625
- Just right back here, ladies.
Let's do this.

02:14.625 --> 02:16.417
- Whoo!
- The scenery going,

02:16.417 --> 02:18.083
just there's so many different
high points as we go

02:18.083 --> 02:20.500
that you'll see--you'll see
the whole entire Baths.

02:20.500 --> 02:23.333
- Do you understand
why I'm frustrated?

02:23.333 --> 02:25.667
- Yeah. We've got to get
the boat ready for the handover.

02:25.667 --> 02:27.792
- This is not life-or-death.

02:27.792 --> 02:30.417
We're not--this is not me saying
we're not friends anymore.

02:30.417 --> 02:33.167
This is not me saying we don't
have an amazing stewardess team.

02:33.167 --> 02:36.000
This is me saying, "Hey, guys,
it's the last day.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
Let's"--
- Let's smash it.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.667
- Yes. Let's smash it.
- Yeah, we're gonna do that.

02:39.667 --> 02:42.000
- So, that's all that this is.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.792
Let's just get this boat
looking good.

02:43.792 --> 02:45.667
- It's very much
in my best interest

02:45.667 --> 02:47.833
to finish the season
on a good note with Kate,

02:47.833 --> 02:51.792
because in yachting, it's vital
to go away with good references.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.667
- And let's inventory all the
wine, liquor, sodas, and water.

03:01.375 --> 03:03.208
- Hi! We have more stuff to do.

03:03.208 --> 03:06.500
I thought that stuff had
gotten done, but it didn't.

03:06.500 --> 03:08.375
It's the last day.
We'll just power through.

03:08.375 --> 03:11.208
- Okay.
- So, and then tomorrow

03:11.208 --> 03:12.667
when the guests leave,

03:12.667 --> 03:14.875
the boat has to be brand-new
and ready to turn over

03:14.875 --> 03:16.042
so we can leave,

03:16.042 --> 03:17.292
so we'll have a lot of stuff
to do.

03:17.292 --> 03:18.667
- Yeah. Totally.

03:18.667 --> 03:20.458
- Kate's being really
insensitive,

03:20.458 --> 03:21.875
to be honest.

03:21.875 --> 03:24.542
Kate should be a little bit
more respectful

03:24.542 --> 03:26.167
of people's breaks.

03:26.167 --> 03:29.375
- Will you get a cloth
and alcohol and water

03:29.375 --> 03:30.958
and get rid
of all the fingerprints?

03:30.958 --> 03:31.958
- Sure.
- Thank you.

03:31.958 --> 03:33.417
- You're welcome.

03:37.333 --> 03:39.875
- Ladies, we're gonna set up
underneath these trees.

03:43.583 --> 03:45.583
- Salmon? Ham?
- I'll have ham.

03:45.583 --> 03:47.583
- Does anyone want any water
or Perrier or--

03:47.583 --> 03:49.417
- Where's the best place
to snorkel?

03:49.417 --> 03:51.667
- I recommend over here.

03:51.667 --> 03:53.542
So, yeah, once you're ready
for any snorkeling

03:53.542 --> 03:55.583
or any food or any other drinks,
just let us know.

03:55.583 --> 03:57.875
We're just gonna be standing
over here then, all right?

04:00.250 --> 04:01.875
- It's bullsh--.

04:14.167 --> 04:17.292
- At this point in the season,
you want to keep things upbeat.

04:17.292 --> 04:18.875
It's almost the end.
Everyone's tired.

04:18.875 --> 04:20.625
Everyone's under a lot
of pressure.

04:20.625 --> 04:22.625
And you have to go through it
and ride above it.

04:22.625 --> 04:24.292
Come on, you got this.

04:24.292 --> 04:26.167
You're fine. You're fine.

04:27.792 --> 04:29.458
I feel like Kate has
just started to, like,

04:29.458 --> 04:32.625
look for things to criticize.

04:32.625 --> 04:35.250
Maybe she's stressed out.
Maybe she's really unhappy.

04:35.250 --> 04:38.083
But I think Emily and I
are kicking ass.

04:38.083 --> 04:40.208
- It's 24 hours. How exciting!

04:40.208 --> 04:41.917
- Yeah.
- Come on.

04:50.583 --> 04:52.542
- Cheers.

04:52.542 --> 04:53.792
Final countdown.

04:53.792 --> 04:55.750
- Are you ready for this
to be over?

04:55.750 --> 04:57.708
- Tomorrow's gonna be mental,
mate.

04:57.708 --> 04:59.333
I've never actually been

04:59.333 --> 05:01.792
in the middle of the
f---ing Caribbean with someone.

05:01.792 --> 05:02.958
Ashley's on the island now.

05:05.667 --> 05:07.500
- At least we can end
this season on a good note.

05:07.500 --> 05:10.417
We did great--our team.

05:11.667 --> 05:13.000
- Who was your least favorite?

05:15.833 --> 05:17.458
- When you guys first met
each other,

05:17.458 --> 05:18.833
you were all about her.

05:18.833 --> 05:19.917
- Well, it was--

05:28.250 --> 05:30.000
- God, it's pretty up here.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.750
I'm sad now.
- I know. I'm sort of sad too.

05:32.750 --> 05:33.958
- I was not sad this morning.

05:33.958 --> 05:35.292
I was like,
"Yay, the last full day!"

05:35.292 --> 05:36.625
- Yeah.
- And now I'm like, "Merr."

05:36.625 --> 05:37.833
- It'll be worse tomorrow,
I think,

05:37.833 --> 05:39.625
when the guests go off.

05:39.625 --> 05:41.542
It's just interesting
'cause it's like

05:41.542 --> 05:44.458
you hate it sometimes, you know,
when you're out here and--

05:44.458 --> 05:46.000
- It's so crazy. Yeah.
Like, this--

05:46.000 --> 05:47.375
- And you just f---ing
hate it,

05:47.375 --> 05:49.542
and then now I'm just like,
"I love it!"

05:49.542 --> 05:51.208
You know, I love everything
about it.

05:51.208 --> 05:52.542
- I hate to part ways
with y'all.

05:52.542 --> 05:54.375
- Yeah, I know,

05:54.375 --> 05:56.042
especially 'cause we all live
everywhere.

05:56.042 --> 05:58.167
- Yeah. You're going
back to England.

05:58.167 --> 06:00.208
F---, halfway
around the world.

06:00.208 --> 06:02.542
- No matter how much we yelled
at each other or bickered,

06:02.542 --> 06:04.042
like, at the end of the day,
we do love each other

06:04.042 --> 06:05.625
and support each other,

06:05.625 --> 06:06.833
and have each other's back
on deck,

06:06.833 --> 06:08.542
which is really nice.

06:08.542 --> 06:10.042
They're on their way back now,
aren't they?

06:10.042 --> 06:12.917
- Yeah. I'm leaving the boat
in three minutes.

06:18.458 --> 06:20.542
- You guys fighting, though,
has nothing to do with me,

06:20.542 --> 06:22.500
and nothing to do
with me and her as a person.

06:22.500 --> 06:23.833
- Yeah.
- That's why I stay out of it.

06:27.750 --> 06:29.417
- You like Kate.
I don't like her.

06:29.417 --> 06:32.000
But it has nothing to do
with you, and I shouldn't change

06:32.000 --> 06:33.250
the feelings that you have
towards Kate,

06:33.250 --> 06:34.583
and you shouldn't change mine.

06:34.583 --> 06:36.375
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

06:38.750 --> 06:40.208
- So, you're in it for the
long haul, are you, today?

06:40.208 --> 06:41.875
No breaky-wakey?

06:41.875 --> 06:44.167
- No. But we don't need
to take a break anyway.

06:44.167 --> 06:45.750
It's the last day,
so we can push through.

06:45.750 --> 06:47.250
It's fine.
- Exactly.

06:47.250 --> 06:51.167
This time tomorrow...

06:51.167 --> 06:52.833
It's gonna be very naughty.

06:52.833 --> 06:55.250
- Are you?
You're gonna be very naughty?

06:55.250 --> 06:59.167
I really like Ben, but of course
there's hesitancies

06:59.167 --> 07:00.917
with where we stand right now.

07:00.917 --> 07:02.500
I've always said
that I'm not ready

07:02.500 --> 07:04.417
for a full-time relationship,

07:04.417 --> 07:07.125
and we're gonna be spending
more time together,

07:07.125 --> 07:09.208
but we'll see how it goes.

07:09.208 --> 07:11.500
- Very cheeky.
- Yeah.

07:12.875 --> 07:14.417
- Ladies, we're ready to go,
okay?

07:14.417 --> 07:17.458
- Well, that was fun.
- Yeah, it was fantastic.

07:17.458 --> 07:19.458
- Hey, Kate,
I'm gonna take off now.

07:19.458 --> 07:20.792
- Okay.

07:20.792 --> 07:22.875
So, Kelley's leaving now
to get the guests.

07:22.875 --> 07:24.375
- Okay.
- Are you just gonna go ahead

07:24.375 --> 07:27.250
and straight fire everything?
- Um...

07:27.250 --> 07:29.292
- I'd love to have everything
ready when they arrive,

07:29.292 --> 07:30.625
'cause I bet they're starving.

07:30.625 --> 07:32.208
- What are the chances
of them going

07:32.208 --> 07:34.458
down to their cabins
for half an hour to change?

07:34.458 --> 07:36.292
- If there is food waiting
for them, they will eat it,

07:36.292 --> 07:38.708
'cause they haven't really
eaten all day.

07:38.708 --> 07:40.958
- I'm just trying
to protect the food; that's all.

07:40.958 --> 07:43.292
- I'm just trying to say
that it's the last night.

07:43.292 --> 07:45.792
We have plenty of food.
Let's just wow them.

07:45.792 --> 07:48.500
"Surprise! You're back!
Look at all this food!"

07:48.500 --> 07:50.250
- Generally, when they get
back to the boat,

07:50.250 --> 07:52.125
they want to shower, change,

07:52.125 --> 07:53.833
and then come up
and have a cocktail.

07:53.833 --> 07:55.958
That's just from my experience.

07:55.958 --> 07:57.333
I'm sorry.
- I really love--

07:57.333 --> 07:59.083
- I'm sorry that
I have so much experience.

07:59.083 --> 08:02.125
- Why are you getting so weirdly
aggressive right now?

08:02.125 --> 08:04.167
- I'm not; I'm trying
to explain my case.

08:04.167 --> 08:06.000
- Okay, so, what should I tell
the guests when they get back?

08:06.000 --> 08:07.333
- And you are not listening.

08:07.333 --> 08:08.792
- "Here are some veggie
quesadillas.

08:08.792 --> 08:10.500
"The chef is preparing
lobster cake bites

08:10.500 --> 08:12.000
and shrimp skewers
if you'd like to shower."

08:12.000 --> 08:13.500
You tell me.

08:13.500 --> 08:14.500
- Yeah. That would be awesome.

08:14.500 --> 08:16.667
- Great.
- Thank you.

08:18.833 --> 08:22.500
- Hey, Carissa up here,
then maybe on the seat.

08:22.500 --> 08:24.750
- That was great, guys.
- Thank you.

08:24.750 --> 08:26.833
- You enjoyed it?
- Yeah!

08:26.833 --> 08:30.042
- Now, Kate thinks I should
put out five hors d'oeuvres

08:30.042 --> 08:32.042
waiting for them
as they come back.

08:32.042 --> 08:34.042
They might want

08:34.042 --> 08:36.542
to go downstairs and shower
and change beforehand,

08:36.542 --> 08:38.708
so it might be a bit
of a waste of food.

08:38.708 --> 08:40.750
Do you think that's valid,
or...

08:42.792 --> 08:44.333
- No, but honestly.
- They're most likely gonna

08:44.333 --> 08:45.875
go down and get changed first.

08:45.875 --> 08:47.708
I mean, it's a nice welcome
for them. I get that.

08:47.708 --> 08:49.708
But if they've just got drinks
and then we--and then--

08:49.708 --> 08:51.125
- Well, that's why I'm just
gonna do just the quesadillas.

08:51.125 --> 08:52.417
- And Kate could say to them--

08:54.708 --> 08:56.958
- Okay.
- I'm here to do my job

08:56.958 --> 08:58.542
and work well with both of them,
and I don't want

08:58.542 --> 09:00.458
to get involved in the problems
that they have,

09:00.458 --> 09:02.208
because they have to fix them
themselves,

09:02.208 --> 09:05.458
and I don't think I could have
any impact whatsoever.

09:05.458 --> 09:07.208
- Since I'm the chef
on the boat,

09:07.208 --> 09:08.458
I'm calling the shots.

09:08.458 --> 09:11.042
If I'm giving a valid reason

09:11.042 --> 09:15.083
as to why I think we should
give them a little bit of time

09:15.083 --> 09:16.583
in case they want to shower,

09:16.583 --> 09:19.208
I think at that point you should
step back and go,

09:19.208 --> 09:21.250
"Maybe the chef
has a point."

09:21.250 --> 09:22.917
- Because I said--
all I asked--

09:22.917 --> 09:24.417
- All right, Kate, just drop it.
I don't care anymore.

09:24.417 --> 09:25.583
- All I asked--
- 'Cause I'm gonna do

09:25.583 --> 09:27.083
whatever I want anyway,

09:27.083 --> 09:28.583
so there's actually no point
in fighting me.

09:28.583 --> 09:31.083
- At this point,
I am delusionally

09:31.083 --> 09:33.167
out of my mind,
not thinking straight,

09:33.167 --> 09:34.750
happy to be going home.

09:34.750 --> 09:36.750
- It's like I'm not even allowed
to speak.

09:36.750 --> 09:39.500
- Unfortunately,
I'm not that lucky.

09:39.500 --> 09:41.458
- You're such a jerk.

09:43.333 --> 09:44.583
- Coming up...

09:44.583 --> 09:46.583
- Aw!

09:46.583 --> 09:48.333
- My God!
- F--- it.

09:54.958 --> 09:55.458
- Hi!

09:55.083 --> 09:55.458
Did you love the Baths?

09:57.292 --> 09:59.542
- My God.
- They're beautiful, right?

09:59.542 --> 10:01.958
So, we have some veggie
quesadillas coming out.

10:01.958 --> 10:03.375
You guys--

10:03.375 --> 10:04.958
- Are you st--
are you hungry?

10:04.958 --> 10:06.458
Yeah.
- That's amazing.

10:06.458 --> 10:08.625
- I'll go get them right now.

10:08.625 --> 10:10.917
Surprise, surprise.

10:10.917 --> 10:12.292
They're hungry.

10:12.292 --> 10:13.917
They're ready
for the quesadillas.

10:13.917 --> 10:15.250
- Are they gonna be
chilling out,

10:15.250 --> 10:16.542
or are they going
down to their cabin?

10:16.542 --> 10:17.958
- Yeah, they said
they're starving.

10:17.958 --> 10:20.250
- Okay.
Have they got little forks?

10:20.250 --> 10:22.792
- I have the forks pulled,
but you recommended

10:22.792 --> 10:25.292
that we not do it, to wait
for them to shower and change.

10:25.292 --> 10:28.292
- If--if they wanted to,

10:28.292 --> 10:31.125
but since they don't, yeah,
put the forks out, please.

10:31.125 --> 10:33.417
- How many hours?
- 16.

10:36.125 --> 10:39.000
- So, this is a low-fat
mozzarella quesadilla

10:39.000 --> 10:41.083
with a black olive
and truffle tapenade.

10:41.083 --> 10:42.458
Wow.

10:45.833 --> 10:47.750
- All right, I will!

10:47.750 --> 10:49.083
- And since it's
our last night...

10:49.083 --> 10:51.167
- Yeah?

10:51.167 --> 10:53.917
- Sure. Okay.
Sounds good.

10:53.917 --> 10:55.625
He would love to join you.

10:55.625 --> 10:56.833
- Great. Thank you.
- I like that.

10:58.250 --> 11:00.000
- Hey, Ben?
The guests have asked

11:00.000 --> 11:01.500
if you could just keep the food
coming.

11:01.500 --> 11:03.500
- Yeah. I will. Thank you.
- Okay.

11:03.500 --> 11:07.000
- In the past, Kate was
a pleasure to work with.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.917
The Kate that made me laugh,
I admired and respected.

11:10.917 --> 11:12.625
I miss that person.

11:12.625 --> 11:14.333
- Captain?
- Yes?

11:14.333 --> 11:15.708
- The guests would like
to invite you

11:15.708 --> 11:17.458
to join them for dinner.

11:19.125 --> 11:21.500
- They're lovely.
You'll have a great time.

11:23.667 --> 11:25.708
- Good-bye, slide!

11:25.708 --> 11:27.333
Happy dance!

11:29.375 --> 11:31.625
It's just been
a f---ing cool experience.

11:31.625 --> 11:35.042
We've grown so much as a team.
Now, to lose all of it,

11:35.042 --> 11:36.833
it's like, "F---."

11:36.833 --> 11:40.708
We've all put our heart, soul,
and even blood into this boat,

11:40.708 --> 11:42.667
so, you know what?

11:42.667 --> 11:43.875
- We'll all stay in touch,
though, you know?

11:43.875 --> 11:45.375
- F--- yes.

11:45.375 --> 11:47.458
We are a family.
A highly dysfunctional family,

11:47.458 --> 11:49.333
but we are, and, you know,
we do have those bonds,

11:49.333 --> 11:50.375
and they are there.

11:50.375 --> 11:53.042
And those don't go away.

11:53.042 --> 11:54.792
One last group hug
at my favorite island

11:54.792 --> 11:55.875
with my favorite deck crew.

11:55.875 --> 11:59.042
- Yay!
- Love you guys.

11:59.042 --> 12:00.750
- Deck team! Ooh-ha-ha!

12:00.750 --> 12:02.583
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

12:05.917 --> 12:07.833
- Hi. How's it going?

12:07.833 --> 12:09.583
- Great.
- Good.

12:09.583 --> 12:11.750
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

12:11.750 --> 12:13.750
- Do you think we're not working
hard enough?

12:13.750 --> 12:15.750
- Actually, yeah,
I was very disappointed

12:15.750 --> 12:18.542
when I went to the master
and all the guest rooms

12:18.542 --> 12:20.542
and saw all
the toilet paper rolls--

12:20.542 --> 12:23.750
- I filled every single toilet
paper roll and folded them

12:23.750 --> 12:25.583
this morning.
- There's no possible way that--

12:25.583 --> 12:28.042
- I'm not lying.
- We have a boat

12:28.042 --> 12:31.167
that has been used for six weeks
very heavily.

12:31.167 --> 12:32.542
- I understand.
- We have--

12:32.542 --> 12:33.917
If you'll just let me finish.

12:33.917 --> 12:35.542
I've always given you
compliments

12:35.542 --> 12:37.208
about what a great worker
you are.

12:37.208 --> 12:41.625
Please don't let--make us finish
on a negative note.

12:41.625 --> 12:44.125
- I'm understanding where you're
coming from. Totally.

12:44.125 --> 12:45.792
- This is--listen.
We're all here.

12:45.792 --> 12:47.792
We're all working.
I'm not taking a break either.

12:47.792 --> 12:49.792
- Good. Let's do it.
- Yeah.

12:49.792 --> 12:50.958
- Totally.
- Thank you.

12:50.958 --> 12:52.542
- You're so welcome.

12:52.542 --> 12:54.458
Now that Kate's, like,
being mean to me,

12:54.458 --> 12:58.042
I'm like, "Get me off of here."

12:58.042 --> 13:01.792
- I feel like you're being
a little bit not that serious.

13:01.792 --> 13:03.292
Maybe that's just me.

13:03.292 --> 13:05.625
But if there's anything
you're upset about--

13:05.625 --> 13:07.875
- No. No worries.
We're cool.

13:07.875 --> 13:10.917
- Sierra's attitude
is unnecessary and rude.

13:26.833 --> 13:28.833
- Hi!
- This is really pretty.

13:28.833 --> 13:30.417
It's a gorgeous presentation.
- Wow.

13:30.417 --> 13:32.333
- Thanks, ladies.

13:32.333 --> 13:34.417
Doesn't he look handsome?
- Pleasure.

13:34.417 --> 13:35.917
- Ben?
- Yes?

13:35.917 --> 13:37.667
- All the guests
are at the table.

13:37.667 --> 13:39.500
- All right. All the guests
are at the table, perfect.

13:39.500 --> 13:40.958
- Yes. Yes. Let's roll.

13:42.625 --> 13:45.333
Hard shell clams in a garlic
and white wine sauce.

13:45.333 --> 13:47.833
- Bon appétit.
- Wow. This is delicious.

13:47.833 --> 13:50.500
- This is the last charter
of the season.

13:50.500 --> 13:52.958
I'm gonna throw the damn book
at them.

13:52.958 --> 13:55.625
And guess what. They deserve it.

13:55.625 --> 13:57.000
- Wow.
- Wow.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.167
- Wow. This is delicious.
- So good.

13:59.167 --> 14:01.208
- So, Captain,
do you have any kids?

14:01.208 --> 14:03.042
- I have five.
- Five!

14:03.042 --> 14:05.167
So, where are you originally
from? Are you originally from--

14:05.167 --> 14:06.458
- Michigan.
- Michigan.

14:06.458 --> 14:07.667
My husband's from Michigan.

14:07.667 --> 14:08.792
- Do you have a boat
of your own?

14:08.792 --> 14:10.375
- Has anyone ever jumped off...

14:10.375 --> 14:11.708
- How long have you been
a boat captain?

14:11.708 --> 14:12.833
- How big is this boat?

14:12.833 --> 14:14.375
- This is 155.

14:14.375 --> 14:16.375
- I'm happy
when the guests are happy.

14:16.375 --> 14:18.042
And generally,
if the guests are

14:18.042 --> 14:19.708
sipping on cocktails
with Captain Lee,

14:19.708 --> 14:21.292
they're a little more happy...

14:21.292 --> 14:22.542
- Yes.

14:22.542 --> 14:24.000
- Even if he doesn't like it.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.875
They loved it.
- Did they?

14:25.875 --> 14:27.875
- It was probably the best
calamari you've done all season.

14:27.875 --> 14:29.333
Honestly. This is it.

14:29.333 --> 14:31.125
- The last f---ing dinner,
mate.

14:31.125 --> 14:33.708
- Let's not get crazy.
- I'm crazy. You know this.

14:33.708 --> 14:35.333
- That's why I like you.
- I know, baby.

14:35.333 --> 14:37.542
- I never know which Ben
I'm gonna get.

14:37.542 --> 14:39.667
I'm 50 shades of Ben, baby.

14:39.667 --> 14:41.542
All right. Here we go.

14:41.542 --> 14:43.500
Filet of mahimahi.

14:43.500 --> 14:45.250
- Beautiful. Thank you.

14:45.250 --> 14:47.667
- Dinner's going well.
The guests are really happy.

14:47.667 --> 14:50.417
Is that for the whipped cream?
Read my mind.

14:50.417 --> 14:52.042
Ben and I are even
getting along.

14:52.042 --> 14:54.250
Ice cream sundae bar.

14:54.250 --> 14:57.167
- So we can just go to town.
- Yes. Just go to town.

14:57.167 --> 14:58.500
- Well done, Kate.

14:58.500 --> 15:02.000
- I never have to do
another platter service.

15:02.000 --> 15:06.000
- Boop-a-doop boop boop!
- That is so exciting!

15:06.000 --> 15:08.083
I just want us all to have
a happy ending.

15:08.083 --> 15:11.042
- The juju's good again.
The juju is good.

15:14.083 --> 15:16.000
- Ben and Kate are
either yelling at each other

15:16.000 --> 15:17.583
in the galley
and hate each other,

15:17.583 --> 15:19.750
or they're together smiling,
laughing.

15:19.750 --> 15:22.083
Their relationship,
it's confusing as sh--.

15:22.083 --> 15:23.583
- Let's just savor this moment.

15:23.583 --> 15:26.792
- Even on your worst day--
our worst day--

15:26.792 --> 15:30.208
it's still better
than the best day

15:30.208 --> 15:32.667
with other chef--
some of the other chefs.

15:36.250 --> 15:37.625
- All right,
we're going to sleep.

15:37.625 --> 15:39.375
Time for bed.

15:43.125 --> 15:46.292
- Look at those white legs.

15:46.292 --> 15:48.417
- You totally are.
I'm just gonna clean up

15:48.417 --> 15:49.750
while you talk to me,

15:49.750 --> 15:50.917
and we'll just chat.

15:53.958 --> 15:56.458
- I love them.
They're a great stewardess team.

15:56.458 --> 15:59.125
But I'm generous
giving them breaks,

15:59.125 --> 16:01.125
and I'm very nice to them,

16:01.125 --> 16:03.042
but I felt disrespected.

16:03.042 --> 16:04.750
Like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah,
we did it."

16:23.333 --> 16:25.250
- I don't understand either,
because--

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
- What does that mean?

16:35.000 --> 16:36.417
- Me either.

16:47.042 --> 16:49.000
- No. I went. I saw it.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.333
I put it back in there.
I was like,

16:50.333 --> 16:51.708
"Okay, nobody needs to know
about this."

16:51.708 --> 16:54.208
It fell back out.
Captain Lee walked in.

16:54.208 --> 16:56.667
I've done nothing
to Nico and Lauren to deserve

16:56.667 --> 16:58.500
the way they're speaking
about me behind my back.

16:58.500 --> 17:02.667
It's not really their place
to question my decision-making.

17:02.667 --> 17:04.708
Maybe when they have
three stripes,

17:04.708 --> 17:06.708
they can offer their opinion.

17:06.708 --> 17:11.208
You know, I've been a really
nice chief stew to them.

17:11.208 --> 17:13.208
I've made them a lot of money,

17:13.208 --> 17:16.875
not back-stabbing, gossip.

17:16.875 --> 17:23.125
I don't need to hear what
the one-stripe people think.

17:26.208 --> 17:28.625
- Coming up...
- I have overheard

17:28.625 --> 17:30.583
discussions y'all have had.
I don't rat out my crew.

17:30.583 --> 17:32.250
- Hey, whoa.
- I'm not done. I'm not done.

17:32.250 --> 17:33.583
- Let's just stop, Kate.
- I'm not done. No.

17:33.583 --> 17:35.083
- This is a one-way
conversation.

17:35.083 --> 17:36.792
- No. You can respond
when I'm finished.

17:47.333 --> 17:49.375
- Man, drop-off today.

17:49.375 --> 17:51.375
- This is awesome.
- Holy sh--.

17:51.375 --> 17:52.583
- Yes.

17:52.583 --> 17:54.833
- Guess what, Ben.
- I give up.

17:54.833 --> 17:59.083
- 2 hours and 26 minutes.

17:59.083 --> 18:01.417
Yay! It's the last day
on the boat.

18:01.417 --> 18:03.667
- I've mentally moved on.

18:03.667 --> 18:05.208
- Where are you now?

18:05.208 --> 18:06.750
- In my apartment.

18:06.750 --> 18:09.875
Secretly, I've been hoping
for this morning

18:09.875 --> 18:11.708
for quite some time now.

18:11.708 --> 18:14.958
Not that I hate my job.
I just find it very strenuous

18:14.958 --> 18:19.292
and emotionally unstabilizing.

18:19.292 --> 18:21.792
- All right, guys. Soak it up,
because this is it.

18:21.792 --> 18:24.208
- I know. That's right.
- Back to reality.

18:24.208 --> 18:27.042
- Kelley, if I could tear you
away from your pedicure...

18:27.042 --> 18:28.917
- Ha!
- Get this anchor up

18:28.917 --> 18:30.625
and out of here, last time.

18:30.625 --> 18:32.708
- Roger that, Cap.
All right, coming up.

18:34.625 --> 18:36.083
- Back to the dock we go.

18:38.375 --> 18:40.208
- Stopper's off.
- Stopper's off, Cap.

18:40.208 --> 18:41.958
- When somebody's shouldering
all the responsibility

18:41.958 --> 18:44.208
at the deck like Kelley was
and then he gets

18:44.208 --> 18:46.958
somebody like Nico
that he can delegate to,

18:46.958 --> 18:48.958
now he can hold Nico
responsible.

18:48.958 --> 18:51.625
And I think that's
good motivation for Kelley.

18:51.625 --> 18:53.667
- Anchor is home and secure
for the last time.

18:53.667 --> 18:55.333
- Roger that.
Time to leave.

18:58.167 --> 19:01.500
- I'm on f---ing fire today.
Like a f---ing matador.

19:01.500 --> 19:03.625
- Me too.
- I know you are, baby,

19:03.625 --> 19:05.333
and that's why I love
working with you.

19:05.333 --> 19:07.000
- I know. Same.

19:08.500 --> 19:11.833
Ladies, we have
a spinach and feta frittata.

19:11.833 --> 19:13.167
- Wow.
- My goodness.

19:13.167 --> 19:14.417
- Wow.
- Wow.

19:19.125 --> 19:21.958
- Deck crew, deck crew, Kate.
- Go for deck crew.

19:21.958 --> 19:24.292
- Hey, Kelley, I saw
some guests in the Jacuzzi.

19:24.292 --> 19:28.000
Can you make sure that one of
your crew puts towels up there?

19:28.000 --> 19:29.333
- Towels are
already up here.

19:33.417 --> 19:35.792
- I'm gonna grab the pump 'cause
we're gonna deflate the fenders

19:35.792 --> 19:37.458
since we don't need them
anymore.

19:39.542 --> 19:41.542
All right, so...
- Yeah?

19:41.542 --> 19:44.792
- Kyle, are you sure that's
better if it's behind your back?

19:46.542 --> 19:48.958
- Lauren, do you think behind
the back is the better way?

19:48.958 --> 19:50.542
So you're facing it.

19:50.542 --> 19:52.208
- I think facing--
yeah, facing it's better.

19:52.208 --> 19:53.542
- Yeah, it's better
to face things.

19:53.542 --> 19:55.625
I hate being the bad guy.

19:55.625 --> 19:58.042
And I especially hate when
people that I've been nice to

19:58.042 --> 19:59.875
put me in that position.

19:59.875 --> 20:03.208
- Dude, Kate is, like,
hating on me today.

20:03.208 --> 20:07.000
Do you know why?
- I really don't.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.167
- She was giving me
some 'tude this morning.

20:09.167 --> 20:11.167
I'm like, "What the f---
did I say?"

20:12.667 --> 20:13.792
- Whoo!
- Cheers.

20:13.792 --> 20:15.708
- To good life girls.

20:15.708 --> 20:17.250
- Let's make this look good.

20:17.250 --> 20:19.375
- Let's do this.
- You ready for this one?

20:26.042 --> 20:27.750
Pull, pull, pull.

20:27.750 --> 20:30.000
- Shut this bitch down
for the last time.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.667
Well done, deck crew.
Thank you.

20:32.667 --> 20:33.917
- Thanks, Cap.

20:33.917 --> 20:36.208
Got it, girl?

20:36.208 --> 20:39.542
- All crew, I need everybody
on the aft deck in ten.

20:45.250 --> 20:47.708
- That's from her being a bitch.

20:53.875 --> 20:55.542
- I don't want to go.
- It's been a pleasure.

20:55.542 --> 20:56.917
Thank you.

20:56.917 --> 20:58.958
You girls have been awesome.
Thank you.

20:58.958 --> 21:00.750
- Thank you so much. Mwah.
- Pleasure meeting you all.

21:00.750 --> 21:01.917
- You guys are amazing.

21:01.917 --> 21:03.583
- Yay!
- Thank you. Thank you.

21:03.583 --> 21:04.875
- You're welcome.

21:04.875 --> 21:06.792
I feel very liberated
and excited

21:06.792 --> 21:08.375
and slightly sad.

21:08.375 --> 21:10.583
It was a really lovely charter
to end on,

21:10.583 --> 21:13.375
but you can get them
off the boat now.

21:13.375 --> 21:16.125
- On behalf of all the women,
we wanted to thank you.

21:16.125 --> 21:17.917
It's been--
I'm gonna get emotional.

21:17.917 --> 21:21.375
This crew has been
extraordinary.

21:21.375 --> 21:23.625
It's just been such an honor
and a pleasure.

21:23.625 --> 21:25.125
I want to give this to you.

21:25.125 --> 21:27.125
- Thank you.
- One more hug before we go.

21:27.125 --> 21:28.458
Thank you.

21:28.458 --> 21:31.750
- Thanks.
- Bye.

21:31.750 --> 21:36.792
- Okay, I need everybody
in the crew mess now.

21:36.792 --> 21:38.208
- Whoo, whoo, whoo!

21:43.417 --> 21:45.792
- I have here the last tip.

21:47.917 --> 21:51.917
There's 16 grand
to be divvied up.

21:51.917 --> 21:53.292
Not too bad.

21:53.292 --> 21:56.500
- $16,000?
I will take that all day long.

21:56.500 --> 22:01.167
It was a good amount
to end the charter season on.

22:01.167 --> 22:02.833
- You guys are going out
this evening,

22:02.833 --> 22:06.583
but before that,
I need you guys to bust your ass

22:06.583 --> 22:07.958
the rest of the day.

22:07.958 --> 22:09.792
Get this boat in better shape

22:09.792 --> 22:12.125
than it was when we got it.

22:12.125 --> 22:15.500
So, we need to get busy, okay?

22:15.500 --> 22:16.958
- Yay!
- Thanks, Cap.

22:16.958 --> 22:19.333
- Yay.

22:19.333 --> 22:20.333
You're funny.

22:25.125 --> 22:28.000
- Nico and Lauren.
Nico and Lauren.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.208
- Go ahead.
- Can you bring me

22:30.208 --> 22:33.208
all of your epaulet shirts
please?

22:33.208 --> 22:34.875
- Absolutely.
We'll do that right now.

22:39.042 --> 22:40.458
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

22:40.458 --> 22:43.333
And if you'll just have a seat.
Thanks.

22:43.333 --> 22:46.667
So, we've got Nico.
- Thank you.

22:46.667 --> 22:48.833
- Okay. If you'll
just have a seat as well.

22:48.833 --> 22:52.208
Nico and Lauren
have given me no option

22:52.208 --> 22:55.500
but to give them bitch face
code black.

22:55.500 --> 22:57.208
There is something
I want to talk about,

22:57.208 --> 22:59.208
and I don't want it
to ruin our night out.

22:59.208 --> 23:01.375
- Yeah?
- But I have overheard

23:01.375 --> 23:02.875
discussions y'all have had.

23:02.875 --> 23:05.500
This boat's not that big.
- About what?

23:05.500 --> 23:07.083
- When the master night
happened,

23:07.083 --> 23:09.542
I didn't say anything
to anyone.

23:09.542 --> 23:11.500
The captain found it on his own.

23:11.500 --> 23:13.250
- Does anybody know
anything about it?

23:13.250 --> 23:15.417
- I know all the deckhands
were in here,

23:15.417 --> 23:17.083
and then Ben joined them.

23:17.083 --> 23:18.917
You know, I kind of, like,
had your back,

23:18.917 --> 23:20.917
because I don't rat out my crew.
- Hey, whoa.

23:20.917 --> 23:22.417
- I'm not done. I'm not done.
- Let's just stop, Kate.

23:22.417 --> 23:23.750
- I'm not done. No.

23:23.750 --> 23:25.333
- This is a one-way
conversation.

23:25.333 --> 23:27.250
- No. You can respond
when I'm finished.

23:27.250 --> 23:28.708
I don't appreciate
when I gave you

23:28.708 --> 23:30.333
generous permission to use it,

23:30.333 --> 23:33.083
then you turning on me
and assuming the worst of me.

23:33.083 --> 23:34.750
- You're right. Is there
anything else you need from me?

23:34.750 --> 23:35.917
- That's all I wanted
to talk about.

23:35.917 --> 23:37.333
- Great.
- Thank you.

23:37.333 --> 23:38.375
- I'm glad we cleared the air,
Kate.

23:38.375 --> 23:40.833
Enjoy the rest of your evening.

23:40.833 --> 23:42.750
- Did you ever think
I was the one

23:42.750 --> 23:44.625
that told the captain
about the bathroom?

23:44.625 --> 23:45.875
- Well, I guess it was assumed.

23:45.875 --> 23:48.208
- Yeah, it was. Wrongly.

23:48.208 --> 23:50.458
- I apologize.

23:50.458 --> 23:52.708
- It's just very disappointing.

23:52.708 --> 23:55.542
At least say to my face
what you say to everybody else.

23:55.542 --> 23:57.458
Okay. Thanks.

23:57.458 --> 23:59.292
All she can say is,
"I'm sorry,"

23:59.292 --> 24:01.708
and leave with her tail
between her legs.

24:01.708 --> 24:03.792
- I got a job to do.
This is my last day here.

24:03.792 --> 24:05.208
Not gonna sit in here
and argue,

24:05.208 --> 24:06.792
and you're not gonna ruin
my day.

24:06.792 --> 24:08.792
You want to go out in a bang,
do it with someone else.

24:08.792 --> 24:10.542
- Best way to handle it.
- Yeah.

24:10.542 --> 24:12.625
- I'm staying the f---
out of it.

24:12.625 --> 24:15.292
She's not taking it out on me.

24:15.292 --> 24:18.500
Have at it, you guys. You just
made an enemy you don't want.

24:21.042 --> 24:22.625
- So happy!

24:22.625 --> 24:25.000
- Let's get this party
started, baby.

24:35.250 --> 24:37.167
- Looks faster here.

24:37.167 --> 24:38.292
- Ashley's here.

24:40.083 --> 24:41.667
- There he is. There he goes.
- Where?

24:41.667 --> 24:43.000
- In the boat.
- Why'd he let me walk

24:43.000 --> 24:44.292
straight past it?

24:44.292 --> 24:46.292
- Hey, Kyle!

24:46.292 --> 24:49.250
- Hi, ass face.

24:49.250 --> 24:51.417
- Me and Ashley
are from Manchester.

24:51.417 --> 24:54.000
We voice our opinion.
We f---ing talk about it.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.833
- I just thought you'd be ready
for me to arrive and not just--

24:56.833 --> 24:58.333
- I was in the middle of
a speedboat lesson, to be fair.

24:58.333 --> 24:59.667
Do you know what I mean?

24:59.667 --> 25:01.292
- Yeah, but you knew
what time I was coming.

25:01.292 --> 25:02.625
- No, I didn't.
- I just thought you'd at least

25:02.625 --> 25:04.292
be a little bit
prepared for me to arrive.

25:04.292 --> 25:05.458
- I just--'cause I said--

25:05.458 --> 25:07.167
the thing is the--
- Hi.

25:07.167 --> 25:09.208
- If you're being an asshole,
you're an asshole.

25:09.208 --> 25:11.167
You have a fight about it,
we'll have a fight about it.

25:11.167 --> 25:13.708
That's just how we communicate.
It just works that way.

25:13.708 --> 25:15.458
- Profile's a bit behind.

25:15.458 --> 25:17.417
Don't.

25:21.875 --> 25:23.458
Boom!

25:23.458 --> 25:25.542
- East England!
- Yeah!

25:25.542 --> 25:26.625
Get loose!

25:26.625 --> 25:29.208
- Yes!

25:36.625 --> 25:39.333
- The end-of-season night out
is always going to be

25:39.333 --> 25:40.625
one of the best.

25:43.375 --> 25:45.042
- Hi.
- Hi, baby.

25:45.042 --> 25:46.625
- Such a nice blazer.
Where'd you get it?

25:46.625 --> 25:49.500
- Somewhere nice.
- I can tell. I love that store.

25:49.500 --> 25:54.083
- This is a great opportunity
to make amends with Kate,

25:54.083 --> 25:56.875
who is a great friend of mine,

25:56.875 --> 26:00.500
especially since we're
not working together anymore!

26:00.500 --> 26:02.208
Kate!
- Get loose.

26:08.083 --> 26:10.000
- Yes!

26:10.000 --> 26:12.417
- Thank you, gorge.

26:12.417 --> 26:15.375
- Coming up...

26:15.375 --> 26:18.375
- Are you okay?
- No, I'm not f---ing okay.

26:18.375 --> 26:20.417
I don't like working
with you anymore.

26:27.167 --> 26:27.833
- All right,

26:27.417 --> 26:27.833
let's turn it up, brah.

26:30.042 --> 26:31.625
- Thank you so much.

26:37.292 --> 26:38.542
Cheers.

26:38.542 --> 26:40.375
- An amazing season
and great crew.

26:40.375 --> 26:41.958
- We're all feeling
a bit loose,

26:41.958 --> 26:45.417
and, um, time to get f---ed up.

26:48.542 --> 26:52.458
- Wagyu beef sliders. Yes.
Perfect.

26:52.458 --> 26:55.125
- Will you pass the soy
and the teacup?

26:55.125 --> 26:56.625
Thanks, hon. Cheers.

26:56.625 --> 26:58.625
- Ben, how did you get it
down to the bone like that?

26:58.625 --> 27:01.750
- It's the first time
I've eaten, like, unashamedly.

27:01.750 --> 27:03.375
I could just eat this all night.

27:03.375 --> 27:05.917
- You should make it.
- I can make it.

27:05.917 --> 27:07.208
So good.

27:09.583 --> 27:12.292
- I'm gonna be excused
for a few minutes.

27:12.292 --> 27:14.458
- The Ben and Kate situation
is confusing.

27:14.458 --> 27:16.500
I don't want to get
more involved with Ben

27:16.500 --> 27:18.250
if there is something
still there,

27:18.250 --> 27:21.125
'cause clearly they're
best friends again.

27:23.667 --> 27:25.333
- They've gone off
for a couple of minutes.

27:25.333 --> 27:26.667
- Do you want to go
for a stroll?

27:26.667 --> 27:27.875
- Yeah.

27:32.833 --> 27:35.333
- It's just there's been so much
that's gone on

27:35.333 --> 27:37.917
between himself and Kate,

27:37.917 --> 27:40.333
and, like, it's confusing me,
'cause from what I've heard

27:40.333 --> 27:44.167
and what I'm seeing
and experiencing,

27:44.167 --> 27:47.667
I don't completely know
where they stand together

27:47.667 --> 27:49.000
and where we stand.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.667
- I think you should
give Ben a chance.

27:51.667 --> 27:53.125
Like, you should give him
the chance

27:53.125 --> 27:55.042
for you guys to get
to know each other.

27:55.042 --> 27:58.792
It's good to talk to him and
get it out and fix the problem.

27:58.792 --> 28:01.708
- I feel like I can't go on
throughout the evening

28:01.708 --> 28:04.000
without saying something
to Ben about it.

28:28.042 --> 28:31.208
- You know, you look really sexy
in that dress, baby.

28:31.208 --> 28:34.375
- Um, I like seeing
who you are with Kate tonight,

28:34.375 --> 28:36.417
'cause it's so amazing
how your work relationship

28:36.417 --> 28:38.250
is so different.

28:38.250 --> 28:41.083
It's the best I've seen you
get on the whole season tonight.

28:41.083 --> 28:43.250
- Well, that's
'cause we're not working.

28:43.250 --> 28:44.917
- No, I know you're not working,
but it threw me

28:44.917 --> 28:47.917
how, like, you can switch
so rapidly like that.

28:47.917 --> 28:49.583
- Ems.
- Yeah?

28:49.583 --> 28:53.250
- It's fine. There's no need
to diagnose this.

28:53.250 --> 28:55.917
I don't ever really like
talking about Kate,

28:55.917 --> 28:58.417
because usually
it just pisses me off.

28:58.417 --> 29:00.250
Unfortunately now Emily's
in the middle

29:00.250 --> 29:01.750
of all of this emotion,

29:01.750 --> 29:04.000
and I don't really know
how to deal with it.

29:09.750 --> 29:13.042
- Would you rather
just me hate her forever?

29:13.042 --> 29:14.583
- No.
- Is that what it is?

29:14.583 --> 29:16.542
- Not at all. It's just
that I don't understand

29:16.542 --> 29:18.125
why you're--defen--
you're defensive--

29:18.125 --> 29:19.625
- Okay, well, then I'm gonna
go back to the bar

29:19.625 --> 29:21.792
and I'm gonna be
really mean to her.

29:21.792 --> 29:23.375
- Just for you.

29:26.958 --> 29:30.292
- The truth is, we are
better off as friends

29:30.292 --> 29:31.875
than colleagues, okay?

29:31.875 --> 29:33.375
I know that now.

29:33.375 --> 29:35.625
She talks to me
like she's my boss.

29:35.625 --> 29:39.125
She brings out
a certain person in me

29:39.125 --> 29:40.792
that I don't want to be.

29:40.792 --> 29:44.917
And if you must demand
these questions,

29:44.917 --> 29:46.792
then I will answer you.

29:46.792 --> 29:48.792
I was actually hoping for you

29:48.792 --> 29:51.583
to have had a better grasp
of the situation.

29:52.958 --> 29:54.458
- No. That's fine.

29:55.958 --> 29:58.375
- I'm confused
as to whether this is right

29:58.375 --> 30:00.667
and whether I want to be treated
like this by someone.

30:05.333 --> 30:06.958
- You're the reason
why I'm here.

30:06.958 --> 30:08.833
You pushed me to be here.

30:08.833 --> 30:11.917
You are who I am. You made me
comfortable about my sexuality.

30:11.917 --> 30:13.333
And that's my beer.
It doesn't matter

30:13.333 --> 30:14.792
how much you suck my d---, love,

30:14.792 --> 30:16.833
that's my f---ing beer,
all right?

30:16.833 --> 30:18.833
I love Ashley--
the only person who's ever

30:18.833 --> 30:20.083
given me the time of day
properly.

30:20.083 --> 30:21.625
She's always been there for me.

30:21.625 --> 30:24.667
I think now is the time
to take things up a notch.

30:50.458 --> 30:54.375
Well, the fact that you've
come out here means more to me.

30:54.375 --> 30:55.667
You wouldn't have come out here

30:55.667 --> 30:57.208
if you didn't f---ing
give a sh--.

30:57.208 --> 31:00.375
So, I just thought this would be
the appropriate time.

31:00.375 --> 31:02.208
Aww.

31:02.208 --> 31:04.000
- My God!
- Yeah.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
- F--- it.
Let's just get married.

31:09.958 --> 31:11.833
- Yes!

31:11.833 --> 31:16.125
- Yeah!

31:16.125 --> 31:17.708
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

31:17.708 --> 31:19.458
Save it for the wedding night!

31:19.458 --> 31:21.042
- Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

31:21.042 --> 31:22.708
- We're English.
We take it easy, boys.

31:22.708 --> 31:24.333
All right, we take it easy.

31:24.333 --> 31:26.750
- How was your walk?

31:26.750 --> 31:30.250
- What?
- How was your walk?

31:30.250 --> 31:31.750
- Fine.

31:31.750 --> 31:34.167
- Fine? Are you okay?

31:34.167 --> 31:38.750
- No, I'm not f---ing okay.

31:38.750 --> 31:41.708
- What's the matter?

31:41.708 --> 31:43.583
Heh. Are you joking?

31:43.583 --> 31:45.250
- No, I'm not joking.

31:45.250 --> 31:47.375
- What's the matter?
I--I'm sorry to laugh,

31:47.375 --> 31:49.833
but what's the matter.
- I need a f---ing drink.

31:49.833 --> 31:51.708
- Okay. Here.

32:01.542 --> 32:04.542
- All right, fine.
I'll tell you.

32:04.542 --> 32:05.792
Do you want me to tell you?

32:05.792 --> 32:07.417
- Yeah.

32:07.417 --> 32:09.458
- I don't like working
with you anymore.

32:16.125 --> 32:16.833
- I don't like working

32:16.542 --> 32:16.833
with you anymore.

32:18.708 --> 32:20.917
- Great.
- We're better off with friends.

32:20.917 --> 32:22.458
Okay? That's it.

32:22.458 --> 32:25.250
- Well, we finished work today,
so...

32:25.250 --> 32:27.375
- All right, well, I don't like
working with you. Done.

32:27.375 --> 32:29.875
- I don't like working
with you that much either.

32:29.875 --> 32:32.542
- Fine.

32:32.542 --> 32:35.250
- I don't...care...

32:35.250 --> 32:36.917
- Good.
- How you feel.

32:36.917 --> 32:38.708
- Good. 'Cause I don't
give a f--- either.

32:38.708 --> 32:41.125
- I think the booze is talking.
I think Ben's talking.

32:41.125 --> 32:43.417
And I'm tired
of hearing all of it.

32:43.417 --> 32:44.958
Well, I--
- I'm pissed off

32:44.958 --> 32:48.083
that Ems just came and f---ing
completely grilled me

32:48.083 --> 32:49.833
about our relationship.

32:49.833 --> 32:52.750
- You know what? I don't
even like being around you.

32:52.750 --> 32:54.333
- Good.

32:54.333 --> 32:57.292
- That was so rude,
I can not even handle it.

32:57.292 --> 33:01.333
Ben is so self-destructive,
it's embarrassing.

33:12.292 --> 33:15.458
What a great end to the season.
What the hell happened?

33:15.458 --> 33:17.250
This was supposed to be
a fun night.

33:19.667 --> 33:21.583
- All right, lads.
I'm going to bed.

33:21.583 --> 33:23.250
- Yeah, mate.
- Take it easy.

33:25.250 --> 33:27.042
- Me and Ashley
get the guest cabin.

33:41.875 --> 33:43.208
- What a night, man.

33:43.208 --> 33:45.208
It was all going so well.

33:45.208 --> 33:47.875
I was being a f---ing tool bag,
all right?

33:47.875 --> 33:50.042
So I was just a f---ing dick,
right?

33:50.042 --> 33:51.500
- Yeah.

34:11.667 --> 34:12.875
- It's the truth, though,
isn't it?

34:12.875 --> 34:14.042
Kyle.

34:15.417 --> 34:16.417
- Kate?

34:16.417 --> 34:18.083
- What?
- Hi.

34:18.083 --> 34:20.250
- Get out of here with that.

34:20.250 --> 34:22.083
- Listen, babe.
I'm sorry

34:22.083 --> 34:24.083
for talking out of turn
last night.

34:24.083 --> 34:26.083
I shouldn't have said
what I said.

34:26.083 --> 34:29.417
I'm just sorry if I ruined
your evening last night.

34:29.417 --> 34:30.917
- Look at you, Ben.

34:30.917 --> 34:33.083
You're coming to my room again

34:33.083 --> 34:35.333
thinking you can sweet-talk
your way out of it.

34:35.333 --> 34:36.917
It's just so typical.

34:36.917 --> 34:39.208
- We've come a long way
together,

34:39.208 --> 34:42.000
and I value our friendship.

34:42.000 --> 34:45.417
And I just f---ing love you,
Kate, all right?

34:45.417 --> 34:48.250
And I'll always be here for you.
Always.

34:48.250 --> 34:49.667
- Okay. Thank you.
- All right?

34:49.667 --> 34:51.000
- I think Ben wants to believe

34:51.000 --> 34:52.917
that our friendship
is salvageable,

34:52.917 --> 34:54.958
but for me, it's not.

34:54.958 --> 34:56.875
- Can I have a hug?

35:00.250 --> 35:03.083
I'll see you soon, all right?

35:04.792 --> 35:06.792
- You're so go-getter.

35:06.792 --> 35:09.417
You don't give a f---,
but in, like, a respectful way.

35:09.417 --> 35:12.125
You just radiate fun
and, like, positivity

35:12.125 --> 35:14.250
and loyalty, and you're
easily one of the,

35:14.250 --> 35:16.542
like, closest best friends
I've ever made

35:16.542 --> 35:18.125
in such a small period of time.

35:18.125 --> 35:22.042
We're just, you know, rock solid
soul mate best friends.

35:22.042 --> 35:24.042
- Come on, now.

35:24.042 --> 35:27.042
Wow, seriously, you know I feel
the same exact way to you.

35:27.042 --> 35:29.792
- It's not like
a romantic situation,

35:29.792 --> 35:31.792
but, you know,
who knows for the future?

35:31.792 --> 35:34.083
- Laurico, baby.
- Ay-ay-ay-ay!

35:34.083 --> 35:35.833
- Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, wah!

35:35.833 --> 35:37.458
- Take care and good luck.
- Thank you so much.

35:37.458 --> 35:39.167
- You're welcome.
- Thank you. Thanks, Cap.

35:39.167 --> 35:41.833
From strangers to becoming
such amazing friends

35:41.833 --> 35:43.458
with such beautiful people,

35:43.458 --> 35:44.833
it's very sad to leave.

35:44.833 --> 35:46.542
See you, hon.

35:52.667 --> 35:54.500
- Said the Wicked Witch
of the West.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.333
- Did you have a good season?
- I did.

35:58.333 --> 35:59.750
- Yeah.

36:02.083 --> 36:04.417
Um...
It takes a certain amount

36:04.417 --> 36:06.583
of thick skin to work on boats,

36:06.583 --> 36:08.333
and I'm not sure
Sierra has that.

36:08.333 --> 36:10.750
- It was fun.
- Yeah, it was most of the time.

36:10.750 --> 36:14.292
- Yeah.
- Sorry. I'm not sorry.

36:14.292 --> 36:16.667
- Thank you, Kate...
- Yeah--pardon?

36:16.667 --> 36:18.042
- For everything.
- My pleasure. You too.

36:18.042 --> 36:19.375
Thank you.
- Bye.

36:19.375 --> 36:20.833
- Bye.

36:23.042 --> 36:24.542
- I'm proud of myself

36:24.542 --> 36:26.625
for keeping
a positive mental attitude.

36:26.625 --> 36:28.208
I'm out!

36:28.208 --> 36:30.042
Later, dudes.

36:30.042 --> 36:32.875
But if there's anything
this season has taught me,

36:32.875 --> 36:35.792
it's that I need to toughen up

36:35.792 --> 36:37.750
and not be so nice.

36:39.792 --> 36:41.125
- You've been,
like, my right-hand man.

36:41.125 --> 36:42.458
I'm gonna f---ing hate
to lose you.

36:42.458 --> 36:44.292
- Yeah.

36:44.292 --> 36:46.708
- But one good thing I'm not
gonna lose you as is a friend.

36:46.708 --> 36:48.208
- Yeah.
Working with Kelley is

36:48.208 --> 36:49.792
very difficult at times.

36:49.792 --> 36:52.208
But it's like,
"Kelley, I f---ing hate you.

36:52.208 --> 36:55.042
Now I love you.
You're like my brother."

36:55.042 --> 36:56.500
- Nico!
- Cap.

36:56.500 --> 36:58.083
- It was a pleasure
having you on board.

36:58.083 --> 36:59.917
I think you have a good future
in this industry.

36:59.917 --> 37:01.667
- Wow. Thank you.
- Stay focused.

37:01.667 --> 37:03.917
Keep your eye
on the prize that you want.

37:03.917 --> 37:06.708
- You know, I'm ready to go home
and do whatever I want,

37:06.708 --> 37:07.833
you know?

37:07.833 --> 37:09.000
Go cut the grass.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.375
That's a weird term.

37:10.375 --> 37:11.750
Ask a yachtie about that

37:11.750 --> 37:13.083
and see if they know
how to do it.

37:13.083 --> 37:14.750
It's honestly been a pleasure.

37:14.750 --> 37:16.833
I appreciate you so much
for everything.

37:16.833 --> 37:19.083
- Take care.
- Okay, Cap.

37:19.083 --> 37:20.917
If I could do one thing
differently,

37:20.917 --> 37:24.583
it was at least made out
with one of the stewardess.

37:24.583 --> 37:27.083
I mean, at least one.

37:29.250 --> 37:30.417
Come on.

37:30.417 --> 37:31.583
- Keep it real?

37:31.583 --> 37:33.458
- Keep the dream alive.

37:37.833 --> 37:40.292
Uno, dos, tres, quatro,
cinco, ses,

37:40.292 --> 37:43.792
siete, ocho, nueve, diez.

37:43.792 --> 37:45.458
- Thank you.			 Gracias.

37:46.958 --> 37:49.583
I think she's all right.
My kind of person.

37:49.583 --> 37:51.375
Doesn't suffer fools gladly.

37:51.375 --> 37:53.458
I'm gonna miss you.
- I'm gonna miss you a lot.

37:53.458 --> 37:54.792
- I'll see you again,
though, right?

37:54.792 --> 37:56.958
- Absolutely.
Manchester wedding?

37:56.958 --> 37:58.292
You have to come.

37:58.292 --> 37:59.958
- You are a legend.

37:59.958 --> 38:01.292
Thank you for your hard work.

38:01.292 --> 38:03.458
You're the man.
Do the can-can.

38:12.083 --> 38:13.375
- Love you, man.

38:20.333 --> 38:22.000
Make sure you get laid.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.333
- Take it easy, brother.
- I will, bud.

38:24.333 --> 38:26.833
F---, this sucks.

38:29.500 --> 38:31.417
- How was it for you?
- It was good.

38:31.417 --> 38:35.500
And I actually, you know,
watched how you led the stews,

38:35.500 --> 38:36.833
and I tried to emulate that.

38:36.833 --> 38:38.583
I'm not quite as good
as you yet.

38:38.583 --> 38:40.333
- I think Kelley
did an amazing job.

38:40.333 --> 38:43.333
He was given a very difficult
crew to work with,

38:43.333 --> 38:44.833
and I know what that feels like.

38:44.833 --> 38:46.000
- I'm gonna miss you.

38:47.583 --> 38:48.958
I'm sure I'll see you
in Lauderdale.

38:48.958 --> 38:50.167
I'll have to make
a special trip.

38:50.167 --> 38:51.167
- Definitely.
- Okay.

38:51.167 --> 38:52.167
- All right.
- Bye.

38:52.167 --> 38:53.417
- Bye.

38:56.000 --> 38:59.833
Hey, Cap'n.
- Kel. It's that time, buddy.

38:59.833 --> 39:03.125
- It is.
It is, unfortunately.

39:03.125 --> 39:07.375
Cap, I just wanted to say I came
here to try to redeem myself

39:07.375 --> 39:10.375
from how I handled last season.

39:10.375 --> 39:12.667
- How do you think
that went for you?

39:15.375 --> 39:16.917
- I think I did better.

39:22.750 --> 39:23.458
- I came here to try

39:23.125 --> 39:23.458
to redeem myself.

39:25.125 --> 39:27.042
- How do you think
that went for you?

39:27.042 --> 39:28.875
- I think I did better.

39:28.875 --> 39:30.458
I still think I got
a lot to work on,

39:30.458 --> 39:32.000
and I think you pointed out
a lot of it.

39:32.000 --> 39:33.958
And I just want
to say thank you.

39:33.958 --> 39:36.500
- Two years ago
when we did this song and dance,

39:36.500 --> 39:38.167
it had some ugly moments...

39:38.167 --> 39:39.625
- Yes, sir.
- To say the least.

39:39.625 --> 39:42.208
But the amount
that you have progressed

39:42.208 --> 39:45.000
in the last couple of years
I think is incredible.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.750
- The words coming out of
Captain Lee's mouth right now

39:46.750 --> 39:48.208
shocked the hell out of me.

39:48.208 --> 39:51.417
- You are an individual
I would work with again.

39:51.417 --> 39:53.208
- Thank you.
That means a lot to me.

39:53.208 --> 39:55.167
I would definitely come back
and work for you in a heartbeat.

39:55.167 --> 39:57.417
- I appreciate that.

39:57.417 --> 39:59.417
- Give me a hug, Captain.

39:59.417 --> 40:03.083
Thanks, Captain Lee,
for giving me a second chance.

40:03.083 --> 40:04.708
So, now I'm going back
to my sport fishing boat,

40:04.708 --> 40:06.917
and I'm gonna free dive
and fish every day

40:06.917 --> 40:08.375
in the Bahamas.

40:10.750 --> 40:13.042
- Listen,
I'd like to apologize

40:13.042 --> 40:14.583
for how I spoke to you
last night.

40:14.583 --> 40:17.750
I'm sorry that I was rude,
you know?

40:17.750 --> 40:19.583
I feel like a bit of a dick,
really.

40:19.583 --> 40:21.542
- Yes.

40:21.542 --> 40:25.042
- I feel bad about it.
I do.

40:27.292 --> 40:29.583
- Well, thank you
for apologizing. Thank you.

40:29.583 --> 40:32.750
- You're the last person that I
would ever, ever want to insult.

40:32.750 --> 40:34.125
- Thank you.
- And I think you're

40:34.125 --> 40:35.792
really special.

40:35.792 --> 40:37.750
- I'm very thankful
that he did that.

40:37.750 --> 40:39.375
It made me feel better.

40:41.792 --> 40:43.125
I'll give him another chance...

40:43.125 --> 40:45.292
- I'm out of here.
- Okay.

40:45.292 --> 40:48.000
I'll still be wary.

40:53.125 --> 40:54.792
- Thank you so much
for a good season.

40:54.792 --> 40:56.625
- I've learned so much
off you.

40:56.625 --> 40:57.875
- Thank you.

40:57.875 --> 40:59.833
- We did it.
- I know.

41:01.292 --> 41:03.250
All right, my love.
- Love you. Bye!

41:03.250 --> 41:04.542
Have a safe journey.
- Thank you.

41:04.542 --> 41:05.958
- And send my love to Ro.

41:05.958 --> 41:07.708
- I will.

41:09.917 --> 41:12.917
- I'll see you soon, all right?
- See you soon. Bye-bye!

41:12.917 --> 41:15.500
- Good-bye, hon-bun.

41:15.500 --> 41:18.583
I feel good about our
conversation in the cabin.

41:20.458 --> 41:23.125
She probably hates me,
but I do like her.

41:26.500 --> 41:28.833
I'm gonna try
and make a go of it.

41:28.833 --> 41:30.917
I'm gonna give it
everything I can.

41:43.125 --> 41:47.125
This season, I think
being in a relationship

41:47.125 --> 41:50.208
and still being able
to do my job

41:50.208 --> 41:53.417
was probably more
than I could chew.

41:55.542 --> 41:57.375
But I think I did okay with it.

41:57.375 --> 41:59.875
I'm not talking ten out of ten.

41:59.875 --> 42:02.042
Maybe a solid seven, though,

42:02.042 --> 42:05.708
which is great, 'cause there's
room for improvement.

42:05.708 --> 42:08.542
- Hi!
- Hi, kiddo.

42:08.542 --> 42:10.958
You did exceptionally well
this year.

42:10.958 --> 42:12.208
- Thank you.
- And I'm gonna miss you.

42:12.208 --> 42:14.042
- I'm gonna miss you too.

42:14.042 --> 42:16.542
I'm really looking forward
to having a normal life.

42:16.542 --> 42:19.208
I'm gonna get a dog.
I'm gonna get a condo.

42:19.208 --> 42:20.375
- Hey, Kate,

42:20.375 --> 42:21.792
you still look like the guest,

42:21.792 --> 42:22.875
not the chief stew.

42:22.875 --> 42:24.708
- Aw, thank you!

42:24.708 --> 42:27.042
The reason I joined yachting
was I wanted to never have

42:27.042 --> 42:30.167
a dull moment in life, so I'm
not sure what's gonna happen

42:30.167 --> 42:31.583
after I walk off this boat,

42:31.583 --> 42:33.625
but I'll be back.

42:34.917 --> 42:36.750
- This year
was exceptionally tough.

42:38.083 --> 42:39.375
- My God.
- Come over here.

42:39.375 --> 42:40.417
- Yeah.
- So I can rip

42:40.417 --> 42:41.917
your f---ing head off.

42:41.917 --> 42:43.583
We had a lot of obstacles
thrown in our way.

42:43.583 --> 42:45.417
- Yo, dude, get the f---
out of the--

42:45.417 --> 42:46.542
get the f--- out of the car!

42:46.542 --> 42:48.208
- Good job, senior deck hand.

42:48.208 --> 42:50.583
- You guys are over the reef.

42:50.583 --> 42:51.917
- God bless my back fat.

42:51.917 --> 42:53.542
- I can come at you
however the f--- I want.

42:53.542 --> 42:55.083
- You know what? Do it!
- But the bottom line is,

42:55.083 --> 42:56.833
the guests left happy...
- I love you.

42:56.833 --> 42:59.083
- We made a ton of money...
- Wow.

42:59.083 --> 43:01.083
- Boo-yah.
- And ultimately,

43:01.083 --> 43:02.917
that's what we're here for.
- I hear that.

43:04.417 --> 43:06.917
- Let's get weird.
- That's so good!

43:06.917 --> 43:08.417
- Without a doubt,

43:08.417 --> 43:10.958
I still have the best damn job
in the world.

43:12.958 --> 43:16.000
