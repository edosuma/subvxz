Present corps!

00:53.286 --> 00:54.287
Left flank!

01:16.409 --> 01:19.746
Man, pot is fun!

01:32.459 --> 01:33.326
Carter?

01:34.461 --> 01:35.328
You okay?

01:35.395 --> 01:37.797
Oh, yeah. Don't worry about me,
worry about these eggs.

01:37.864 --> 01:39.699
They just made the ultimate sacrifice.

01:42.735 --> 01:45.805
Oh. Here we go. Pickles.
You know the tragic thing about pickles?

01:46.139 --> 01:49.242
No matter how hard they try,
they will never, ever--

01:49.309 --> 01:51.177
-"Ever" ever?
-"Ever" ever.

01:52.512 --> 01:53.713
--be cucumbers again.

01:54.347 --> 01:57.550
Innocence lost,
but still goddamn delicious.

01:59.652 --> 02:03.123
-I guess he's one of us now.
-Yeah, he's really opened up.

02:03.189 --> 02:04.724
Should we maybe close him a little?

02:05.458 --> 02:06.759
No, he'll find his way.

02:07.160 --> 02:08.828
He's on the classic hero's journey.

02:08.895 --> 02:11.131
Shouldn't it be "Vlasic hero's journey"?

02:12.665 --> 02:15.201
-Right?
-Point, Travis.

02:16.202 --> 02:17.537
I don't-- I don't get it.

02:23.843 --> 02:24.711
Hey.

02:25.178 --> 02:26.746
-Got a minute for me and Pete?
-Sure.

02:27.480 --> 02:30.783
-What you reading?
-The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up.

02:31.618 --> 02:33.353
You no longer spark joy.

02:34.921 --> 02:36.389
Thank you for your service.

02:42.228 --> 02:44.330
Yeah, I, uh-- I just wanted to remind you,

02:44.497 --> 02:47.167
that the pot-ographer I hired
is coming this afternoon.

02:47.233 --> 02:48.935
Oh, yeah, that Jake Bone guy.

02:52.438 --> 02:54.707
-What?
-I'm sorry, I'm just in awe of him.

02:55.174 --> 02:57.644
Oh, okay. So, anyways, yeah,
Jake Bone's gonna come--

03:00.947 --> 03:03.716
Explain to me again
why we can't photograph our own weed.

03:04.384 --> 03:05.952
Uh, we can, but he's the best.

03:06.219 --> 03:07.854
I mean, no other pot-ographer has had

03:07.921 --> 03:10.356
as many centerfolds in High Times
as Jake Bone.

03:12.725 --> 03:13.860
You have to stop, dude.

03:13.927 --> 03:15.929
Sorry, he's like a hero to me.

03:16.195 --> 03:18.398
Hey, you have to be careful
meeting your heroes.

03:18.531 --> 03:21.334
I remember the time
I met Archbishop Desmond Tutu.

03:21.401 --> 03:22.635
He grabbed my ass.

03:25.538 --> 03:28.408
He told me in his country
it was a sign of respect.

03:29.742 --> 03:31.978
Okay, I'll go tell Olivia
we can cut him a check.

03:32.245 --> 03:33.846
Why do you have to go tell Olivia?

03:34.881 --> 03:36.282
'Cause she cuts the checks.

03:37.650 --> 03:38.785
How convenient.

03:40.753 --> 03:41.888
You gave her the job.

03:42.522 --> 03:45.258
Point, Travis. Two, love.

03:46.859 --> 03:48.761
And she grabbed Tutu's ass first.

03:51.598 --> 03:55.768
I swear I'm gonna get them together
if it's one of the next things I ever do.

03:56.402 --> 03:57.437
Oh.

03:57.503 --> 03:59.706
-They already got together.
-What?

03:59.772 --> 04:01.975
Well, sort of.
She was over a couple weeks ago.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.409
She was?

04:03.476 --> 04:04.344
Come here.

04:05.778 --> 04:07.680
Did they, you know, do it?

04:09.582 --> 04:11.584
They were going to,
but it didn't work out.

04:11.718 --> 04:13.286
Travis said it got weird.

04:13.786 --> 04:15.521
What does that mean, weird?

04:17.357 --> 04:20.392
That's a question I've been wrestling with
my whole life. Heh.

04:23.329 --> 04:24.564
I'll take it from here.

04:24.631 --> 04:26.833
Why are you so into them
getting together anyway?

04:27.700 --> 04:30.303
Uh-- I don't know.
I feel like they'd make a good couple.

04:30.837 --> 04:31.971
Oh, of course.

04:32.672 --> 04:35.341
I thought maybe
you were subconsciously overcompensating

04:35.408 --> 04:38.711
for being a frequently absentee mother
by finding a younger proxy

04:38.778 --> 04:41.281
to make him happy
in the way you feel you didn't.

04:44.484 --> 04:46.352
What do I know? I'm no psychometrist.

04:52.025 --> 04:54.694
Hey. You keep that bullshit to yourself.

05:00.800 --> 05:03.369
Okay.

05:03.870 --> 05:06.072
All right, and with that bud from Utah,

05:06.339 --> 05:10.310
Fifty Tokes from Fifty States smoke tour
is now complete.

05:11.678 --> 05:15.448
Thanks to all 50 fans who contributed
joints from their home states.

05:15.515 --> 05:19.052
Plus the two who told us they got arrested
for some interstate bullshit.

05:19.319 --> 05:22.789
- That shit's on you, dudes.
- Mm-hm.

05:22.855 --> 05:24.490
How many times we gotta tell you?

05:24.557 --> 05:27.527
You have to pack that weed
in freaking coffee, stupids.

05:27.593 --> 05:31.664
Yeah, we would refer you
to our webisode number 86:

05:31.798 --> 05:34.967
Packing Your Weed in Freaking Coffee,
Stupids!

05:35.568 --> 05:40.940
Thanks to my niece, Rivke,
for donating this weird circle map.

05:41.007 --> 05:43.643
Yeah, we didn't know
what the hell this was.

05:43.976 --> 05:48.081
But then we came to the conclusion
that it's a map of famous American holes.

05:49.348 --> 05:51.384
There are even holes in the ocean.

05:51.451 --> 05:54.887
Oh. Those aren't holes,
those are underwater crop circles.

06:00.059 --> 06:02.595
How are you not president yet, huh?

06:02.662 --> 06:04.797
Yeah, I keep meaning to do that.

06:04.864 --> 06:06.499
Yeah. God!

06:06.566 --> 06:09.102
Anyway, that's it for us. We're done.

06:09.368 --> 06:10.503
-Wait, wait, wait.
-What?

06:10.670 --> 06:12.805
Weren't we supposed
to say something at the end?

06:12.872 --> 06:15.541
I feel like we've been saying something
this whole time.

06:18.010 --> 06:21.114
Next election, I am writing you in. Shit!

06:21.781 --> 06:23.449
We're done, dude.

06:23.883 --> 06:26.085
-Man, all right. Oh, shit.
-Bye.

06:26.152 --> 06:27.787
-See you later.
-See you.

06:29.422 --> 06:30.623
We remembered!

06:30.690 --> 06:33.126
We do! Oh, God!

06:33.392 --> 06:35.461
You guys, we have gone pro.

06:35.528 --> 06:39.398
That's right, Dank and Dabby
are now officially sponsored

06:39.465 --> 06:41.467
by Ruth's Alternative Caring!

06:41.534 --> 06:43.703
So, come to Ruth's.

06:45.438 --> 06:49.609
For all the finest in marijuana things.

06:50.676 --> 06:53.646
Conveniently located off of a road.

06:55.181 --> 06:59.852
Everything in that store
will help you get high, guaranteed.

07:00.186 --> 07:02.955
And that's--
That's different from other stores,

07:03.022 --> 07:06.192
like Home Depot
where only most things get you high.

07:07.660 --> 07:11.531
Oh! Oh! But wait, Dank, there's more.

07:11.898 --> 07:12.999
There is?

07:18.538 --> 07:19.539
Actually, there's not.

07:20.039 --> 07:23.643
I just realized
this is for holding quarters.

07:24.477 --> 07:25.711
Jesus, baby.

07:26.179 --> 07:27.780
How high are you?

07:35.021 --> 07:36.989
Travis, get in here. We need to talk.

07:38.925 --> 07:41.661
-Now what are you reading?
-The Purpose Driven Life.

07:42.528 --> 07:44.197
-Why?
-I have no idea.

07:45.832 --> 07:46.699
So, listen.

07:47.533 --> 07:49.869
I've been doing some
intense soul-spelunking...

07:51.103 --> 07:55.675
and I realized I was wrong
to interfere with your personal life.

07:55.741 --> 07:58.744
I mean, are you schtupping Olivia?
Are you not schtupping Olivia?

07:59.011 --> 08:00.513
You know? I could give a shit.

08:02.215 --> 08:06.018
-What brought about the change of heart?
-I was looking in the mirror and I said:

08:06.085 --> 08:10.256
"Ruth, you don't have to find
a younger proxy to make Travis happy

08:10.523 --> 08:13.960
because you were an absentee mom
during his formative years."

08:14.961 --> 08:16.662
And you know what? I was right.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.199
Okay, well... thanks.

08:21.234 --> 08:22.735
-Hey, Travis?
-Hmm?

08:22.802 --> 08:25.238
When you see Olivia,
tell her I'm done meddling.

08:25.838 --> 08:27.907
She doesn't have to provide grandchildren.

08:28.774 --> 08:33.546
I'm prepared to die...
knowing you're the last of my line.

08:35.014 --> 08:36.849
Cool, she'll be happy to hear that.

08:41.087 --> 08:42.121
Mmm!

08:42.587 --> 08:43.289
Pickle juice.

08:43.956 --> 08:45.725
I'm either fucked up or pregnant.

08:50.229 --> 08:52.965
Are you sure I'm not bothering you
with this stuff?

08:53.032 --> 08:56.302
Not at all. I just promised Travis
I'd quit meddling in his life,

08:56.636 --> 08:58.571
so, now I'm free to dick around in yours.

08:59.105 --> 09:00.773
Perfect! Okay, okay.

09:01.107 --> 09:04.143
So, last Friday,
I'm at Disney World with my family.

09:04.810 --> 09:06.879
Jim had taken the kids
to the character buffet

09:06.946 --> 09:09.215
so, I decided to hang back
in the Tinker Bell suite

09:09.582 --> 09:12.218
to finish vaping
the last of my Cinderella OG.

09:12.285 --> 09:14.854
Ooh! Disney princess.

09:15.321 --> 09:17.823
In a glass vape pen. Ah!

09:18.257 --> 09:19.592
I prepare!

09:19.659 --> 09:21.894
Okay, so, I'm four puffs in
on the balcony,

09:21.961 --> 09:23.963
I'm watching the sun
set over Space Mountain

09:24.030 --> 09:25.698
when suddenly the door flies open

09:25.765 --> 09:29.302
and Jim and the kids come running in
screaming like there's no tomorrow.

09:29.569 --> 09:33.239
Turns out, they had fried
the chicken tenders in peanut oil.

09:33.306 --> 09:34.607
Yum.

09:34.674 --> 09:36.776
No. Anaphylactic shock.

09:36.842 --> 09:38.978
-So, no "yum"?
-No.

09:39.645 --> 09:41.948
Brynn's face swells up
like a Cabbage Patch Kid,

09:42.014 --> 09:45.084
Connor's screaming 'cause we had
to yank him off Snow White's lap,

09:45.151 --> 09:48.120
and Jim's flailing around
'cause he forgot how to use an EpiPen,

09:48.187 --> 09:52.091
even though I've showed you
20 fucking times, Jim.

09:53.192 --> 09:55.328
So, now I have to be the responsible one,

09:55.761 --> 09:58.164
and I am as high as a giraffe's nuts.

09:59.765 --> 10:00.666
But I don't panic.

10:00.733 --> 10:04.704
With perfect clarity,
I administer the shot, I call 911,

10:04.770 --> 10:08.608
I comfort Connor, I send my husband
to the ice machine for a time-out.

10:09.075 --> 10:12.912
And I do it all without thinking.
It just felt so natural.

10:12.979 --> 10:15.181
And suddenly, I remembered what you,

10:15.247 --> 10:18.951
my rabbi-slash-shaman, told me
the first time we met.

10:19.652 --> 10:23.889
Maria, smoking cannabis
isn't about withdrawing from your family.

10:24.256 --> 10:26.258
It's about altering
your perception of them,

10:26.826 --> 10:28.194
so they're tolerable.

10:34.200 --> 10:35.201
Any-- Anyway...

10:36.235 --> 10:38.037
since then, I've been great.

10:38.104 --> 10:41.841
Calm, cool, less resentful,
more tolerant...

10:42.375 --> 10:44.744
and like I was before I had kids!

10:46.078 --> 10:48.314
Oh, Maria, I'm so happy for you.

10:48.381 --> 10:50.249
Is there something I can do for you now?

10:50.883 --> 10:52.018
No, I'm all good.

10:52.084 --> 10:53.019
You sure?

10:53.653 --> 10:56.188
Sounds like you and Jim
might have a few issues.

10:56.255 --> 11:00.993
Oh, I don't know. At the end of the day,
he's my best friend.

11:01.060 --> 11:02.795
Oh, Jesus Christ.

11:10.970 --> 11:13.039
Good news is
she promised to stop interfering.

11:13.105 --> 11:15.408
The bad news is
she never keeps her promises.

11:17.076 --> 11:19.845
Well, let's focus on the good news.

11:20.312 --> 11:23.082
Yeah, I mean,
we don't have to be in a relationship.

11:23.716 --> 11:25.317
-Yeah, but we can choose to be.
-Hmm.

11:25.384 --> 11:27.086
It's something to think about.

11:28.087 --> 11:30.389
Hey, I'm looking for Travis Feldman.

11:31.190 --> 11:32.458
I'm Jake Bone.

12:52.905 --> 12:56.041
White guy passes to a white guy
over to the other white guy. He shoots,

12:56.108 --> 12:58.210
it's blocked by another white guy.

12:58.511 --> 13:01.247
That's right,
there are nothing but white guys here.

13:01.981 --> 13:03.782
What kind of sport is this?

13:05.151 --> 13:07.186
-Hey, Carter.
-Hey, Jenny.

13:07.920 --> 13:10.089
I see you brought
the foosball table up here.

13:10.156 --> 13:11.123
Yes, I did.

13:12.191 --> 13:14.527
Dragged it up a spiral staircase
by yourself, huh?

13:14.793 --> 13:17.830
If I can unassemble and reassemble an M4
in less than 30 seconds,

13:17.897 --> 13:19.932
I can certainly do it
with a foosball table.

13:20.399 --> 13:21.267
Cool.

13:21.834 --> 13:25.171
So, listen. Ruth's a little concerned
about how much you're medicating--

13:25.237 --> 13:26.872
Foosball is essentially soccer.

13:26.939 --> 13:30.476
You would think there'd be some Brazilians
or some Mexicans. Somebody brown.

13:31.577 --> 13:32.578
There's nobody brown.

13:33.245 --> 13:34.547
That's racist. This is racist.

13:35.414 --> 13:37.416
Carter, what did you smoke today?

13:37.483 --> 13:39.518
I think you pot veterans
call it Trainwreck.

13:40.519 --> 13:42.588
Makes sense. A high-energy sativa.

13:43.255 --> 13:46.058
Classic drag-a-foosball-table-to-the-roof
kind of strain.

13:47.092 --> 13:51.330
Have you ever considered keeping a journal
to monitor how much pot you're taking?

13:51.997 --> 13:53.999
A journal? Like a diary?

13:54.466 --> 13:55.334
Who am I, Travis?

13:57.570 --> 14:01.273
No, no, it's just an easy way
to keep track of some basic information.

14:01.407 --> 14:03.409
See, here's mine.

14:04.510 --> 14:06.178
Indica's blue, sativa's red.

14:06.245 --> 14:08.113
Indica-dominant hybrid's aubergine.

14:08.180 --> 14:09.949
Date, time of day, amount, et cetera.

14:10.482 --> 14:13.085
What is this, a haiku?
"Moonlight in autumn.

14:13.285 --> 14:16.388
Dew on the chrysanthemums.
I'm a bad daughter." Did you write this?

14:17.456 --> 14:20.059
What, just because I'm Asian,
you think I write haikus?

14:20.492 --> 14:22.027
That's racist.

14:25.164 --> 14:28.067
Man, I'm so high, she's paranoid.

14:33.072 --> 14:34.974
Are you skipping class to do grass?

14:35.341 --> 14:37.343
Did you know it's wack to do crack?

14:37.643 --> 14:40.246
Are you a loser for being a drug user?

14:40.646 --> 14:41.513
The answer...

14:42.915 --> 14:43.582
is yes.

14:47.653 --> 14:48.921
Hi, kids.

14:48.988 --> 14:51.557
I'm Tae Kwon Douglas
for Intensity Plus Fight School,

14:51.624 --> 14:53.626
and I'm here to offer you another path,

14:53.993 --> 14:55.027
the right path...

14:57.096 --> 14:58.130
the fight path.

15:05.404 --> 15:09.575
Here in my dojang, you'll learn how
to kick drugs with your legs.

15:15.147 --> 15:17.149
Looks like crack's been cracked.

15:17.616 --> 15:20.586
My method is better than a meth OD.

15:23.923 --> 15:24.990
Oh...

15:26.692 --> 15:29.428
Together, we can deal
those dirty-dealing dealers

15:29.495 --> 15:32.031
the Intensity Plus butt-kicking
they deserve.

15:32.398 --> 15:34.233
'Cause when it comes to pot pushers...

15:37.636 --> 15:38.604
I'm ruthless.

15:39.705 --> 15:40.572
Don't believe me?

15:41.240 --> 15:43.475
Look at these students
that resemble some of mine.

15:51.517 --> 15:53.585
Intensity Plus Fight School,

15:54.119 --> 15:55.688
because if you wanna stay drugless...

15:57.222 --> 15:59.158
come see Tae Kwon Douglas.

16:04.596 --> 16:06.465
Man, that dude needs to get laid.

16:10.569 --> 16:14.206
Man, photographing marijuana
seems like a dream job.

16:14.673 --> 16:16.108
Then you dream small.

16:17.977 --> 16:20.279
I just do this to support my true calling,

16:21.213 --> 16:22.147
parasailing.

16:23.749 --> 16:26.151
Oh, yeah. I've seen that.
That looks so cool.

16:26.218 --> 16:29.088
Those guys, like, jumping off cliffs
with kites on their backs.

16:29.154 --> 16:30.022
I mean, that's--

16:30.089 --> 16:31.090
That's paragliding.

16:32.624 --> 16:33.625
What's the difference?

16:34.259 --> 16:38.530
Parasailing is you and the ocean,
and a boat,

16:38.597 --> 16:41.533
and a harness, and a canopy wing,

16:42.201 --> 16:44.003
and Kyle the guy driving the boat,

16:44.436 --> 16:46.638
and the people who on the shore
are watching you,

16:46.705 --> 16:49.775
and the knowledge that at any moment,
you could plummet 30, 40 feet

16:50.042 --> 16:51.510
into the water and it would hurt.

16:53.345 --> 16:57.116
Paragliding is for pussies
and quadriplegics.

17:00.219 --> 17:02.521
You. What's your name again? Paul?

17:02.588 --> 17:04.356
It was Pete, but I can change it.

17:06.525 --> 17:07.792
I'm done with your nugs.

17:08.460 --> 17:10.796
-I'm ready to shoot your plants.
-All right, great.

17:11.563 --> 17:13.432
Get ready, girls. This is your close-up.

17:14.098 --> 17:17.169
Oh, you're one of those hippie freaks
that talks to the plants.

17:17.803 --> 17:18.737
Groovy.

17:20.672 --> 17:21.707
They ever talk back?

17:22.574 --> 17:24.742
No, but I like to think they can hear me.

17:27.413 --> 17:29.448
What commune did you dig him out of?

17:30.616 --> 17:34.286
The Humboldt County New Century Kibbutz
and Doomsday Prep Station.

17:35.220 --> 17:37.256
Go, Dung Beetles.

17:37.356 --> 17:40.159
Hey. How's it going in here?

17:47.733 --> 17:49.134
One question.

17:49.501 --> 17:52.838
Tonight, when you come over,
am I gonna have to waste an hour

17:53.105 --> 17:55.240
pretending to care
about your hopes and dreams,

17:55.307 --> 17:57.376
or are we just gonna get
right to Jake Boning?

18:00.579 --> 18:01.447
Stop!

18:02.114 --> 18:03.782
Stop! Cancel the fantasy.

18:04.416 --> 18:06.718
You started talking. Stop the bed.

18:06.785 --> 18:07.653
Wait.

18:08.153 --> 18:09.288
Stop the bed.

18:09.755 --> 18:10.856
Stop--

18:14.460 --> 18:17.129
Why am I having an '80s fantasy anyway?

18:17.629 --> 18:18.864
I wasn't even born yet.

18:19.598 --> 18:21.433
It should be like a Britney thing.

18:23.502 --> 18:24.870
Aw... Damn it.

18:31.310 --> 18:33.545
-Hi, I'm Ruth.
-You sure are.

18:34.513 --> 18:35.447
And I'm Pete.

18:35.581 --> 18:36.882
Welcome to Strain O' the Day.

18:37.349 --> 18:39.585
Today's strain is an in-house grow

18:39.651 --> 18:42.621
originating in the Black Forest
from Germany.

18:42.821 --> 18:44.289
And it's called that.

18:44.790 --> 18:45.657
There.

18:46.492 --> 18:49.828
And out of respect for my tongue
and Angela Merkel, I'm not saying it.

18:51.296 --> 18:52.164
I will.

18:52.297 --> 18:55.334
Erschreckendglückseligkeit OG
is a German word

18:55.400 --> 18:57.603
that means "frightening bliss OG."

18:57.903 --> 19:01.206
And while there's no equivalent concept
or cannabis in English,

19:01.340 --> 19:04.276
once you smoke
Erschreckendglückseligkeit OG,

19:04.743 --> 19:05.878
you'll understand.

19:07.579 --> 19:10.516
Those Germans, huh?
They got a weed for everything.

19:11.617 --> 19:14.620
Now, usually this is when we'd show you
a close-up of our bud,

19:15.154 --> 19:18.290
but why do that
when we can wow you with a beautiful image

19:18.357 --> 19:22.427
taken by the king of pot-ography,
Jake Bone?

19:23.262 --> 19:24.563
How about this?

19:24.863 --> 19:28.167
That'd look swell
in your Oberlin dorm room, right?

19:30.602 --> 19:31.570
Wait. Hold on.

19:31.904 --> 19:34.907
That's not my
Erschreckendglückseligkeit OG.

19:35.574 --> 19:36.441
It's not?

19:36.842 --> 19:38.510
Well, it is, but...

19:40.212 --> 19:41.413
it's been Photoshopped.

19:43.415 --> 19:44.316
How can you tell?

19:45.217 --> 19:48.387
Look at it. It's too... perfect.

19:48.453 --> 19:50.589
These proportions
are botanically impossible.

19:50.656 --> 19:52.291
Real plants don't look like this.

19:52.357 --> 19:54.826
I mean, look at those big fake tips.

19:58.931 --> 20:00.432
You're fucking with me, right?

20:04.369 --> 20:09.775
Jake Bone, if you're watching this,
you need to know I am very upset.

20:10.409 --> 20:13.579
So, consider yourself
alerted to my feelings.

20:14.613 --> 20:16.748
Uh, thanks for watching Strain O' the Day.

20:16.815 --> 20:21.286
If you hear footsteps coming up behind you
and they sound like size ten Birkenstocks,

20:21.620 --> 20:22.754
they could be mine.

20:22.888 --> 20:24.723
I walk very close to people.

20:26.625 --> 20:29.528
-Until next time. I'm Ruth.
-And I'm devastated.

20:34.700 --> 20:37.536
Sophie. Maria, listen.

20:37.603 --> 20:39.905
I'm the room mom
for the third-grade talent show,

20:39.972 --> 20:42.975
and I know you wanted
both of your twins to perform,

20:43.408 --> 20:45.310
but, gosh, we only have one slot left.

20:46.011 --> 20:47.679
I'm sorry.

20:47.813 --> 20:49.815
You're gonna have to make a choice,
Sophie,

20:49.881 --> 20:52.951
'cause the train is leaving the station.

20:55.887 --> 20:56.755
Check it out.

20:57.422 --> 20:58.957
I started a journal for you.

21:00.459 --> 21:01.827
Here's what you smoked today.

21:01.893 --> 21:04.630
You just need to fill in
how much, how often,

21:04.696 --> 21:07.966
and the name of the family member
you think is most disappointed in you.

21:09.735 --> 21:12.804
I'm confused.
Are you doing this for me or for you?

21:13.705 --> 21:15.374
Ha. What do you mean?

21:15.607 --> 21:18.810
I mean... you're always around here
playing doctor.

21:19.678 --> 21:23.915
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-Yes, you do. Jenny... what's going on?

21:24.850 --> 21:26.652
Screw it.

21:28.620 --> 21:30.589
Everybody, can I have your attention?

21:32.291 --> 21:35.560
I'm sure you've all been wondering,
"What's up with Jenny?"

21:36.662 --> 21:38.063
-Is it about that hat?
-Gotta be.

21:40.399 --> 21:42.934
It's not a big deal. It's just...

21:44.002 --> 21:47.739
I'm supposed to be finishing
my last semester of medical school,

21:48.340 --> 21:49.508
but I dropped out.

21:50.475 --> 21:52.511
And instead I'm working here

21:52.577 --> 21:55.714
and getting high all the time,
which my parents don't know about.

21:56.381 --> 21:58.450
And when they find out,
they're gonna kill me,

21:58.517 --> 21:59.718
and then kill themselves.

22:02.754 --> 22:03.622
So...

22:04.890 --> 22:07.959
you did write that haiku.
I knew I wasn't racist!

22:11.963 --> 22:14.666
Sheilas, behold a lie.

22:16.335 --> 22:19.738
A false image perpetuating
unrealistic beauty standards.

22:21.073 --> 22:23.675
You should know
it's what's inside that matters.

22:24.443 --> 22:27.446
THC, CBD, terpenes.

22:28.013 --> 22:29.648
Real buds have stems.

22:32.451 --> 22:33.118
Good day, mate.

22:33.819 --> 22:35.921
Really? What's so good about it?

22:36.621 --> 22:39.124
Remember what I told you
about meeting your heroes?

22:39.391 --> 22:40.425
Yeah.

22:40.492 --> 22:43.628
That's why I'm so careful
when people meet me for the first time.

22:44.996 --> 22:47.399
I mean, I know I'm human, but they don't.

22:52.504 --> 22:54.673
Jake made fun of me
for talking to the plants.

22:55.774 --> 22:57.008
Do you think I'm crazy?

22:57.075 --> 22:58.510
Not for that reason.

22:59.778 --> 23:02.114
I'd be a little worried
if you heard them talking back to you.

23:03.115 --> 23:04.983
Yeah, well, that's never happened.

23:06.985 --> 23:08.120
You're a good soul, Pete.

23:09.488 --> 23:10.856
And you're wiser than you know.

23:14.059 --> 23:14.926
Thanks, Ruth.

23:16.094 --> 23:17.496
- Pete. Pete.
- Pete. Pete.

23:17.562 --> 23:19.431
- Pete! Pete! Pete!
- Pete! Pete!

23:19.498 --> 23:20.799
- Pete! Pete!
- Pete! Pete!

23:20.866 --> 23:22.534
- Pete!
- Pete! Pete!

23:23.305 --> 23:29.480
