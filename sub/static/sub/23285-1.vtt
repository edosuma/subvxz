01:05.107 --> 01:07.472
Well, good news.

01:07.474 --> 01:09.674
I found your car keys.

01:09.676 --> 01:12.077
That's where I left them.

01:12.079 --> 01:14.514
You know, you have the
prostate of an 18-year-old.

01:14.516 --> 01:16.681
Nice! I'd rather have
his dick,

01:16.683 --> 01:18.584
but you get what you get.

01:18.586 --> 01:21.320
Next time,
buy me dinner first.

01:24.092 --> 01:26.058
That's a good one.

01:26.060 --> 01:27.192
I like that joke.

01:27.194 --> 01:29.697
I hadn't heard that before.

01:34.902 --> 01:36.903
<i>Come on.
Why do I have to go?</i>

01:36.905 --> 01:37.936
<i>Because</i>

01:37.938 --> 01:39.171
<i>it's his weekend
and you're not missing</i>

01:39.173 --> 01:40.204
<i>your grandmother's wedding.</i>

01:40.206 --> 01:41.306
It's no fun there.

01:41.308 --> 01:42.674
<i>Last time he made me watch</i>

01:42.676 --> 01:44.943
<i>an entire Super Bowl
from 1979.</i>

01:44.945 --> 01:47.079
<i>Who watches a 30-year-old
football game?</i>

01:47.081 --> 01:50.749
<i>He's always angry
or pissed off...</i>

01:50.751 --> 01:52.451
<i>Don't say that
about your father.</i>

01:52.453 --> 01:53.952
<i>It's not my fault
he's an asshole.</i>

01:53.954 --> 01:55.221
<i>We're not
having this discussion.</i>

01:55.223 --> 01:56.588
<i>Go get your bag.</i>

02:10.838 --> 02:12.271
<i>Pick Enterprise.</i>

02:12.273 --> 02:13.671
<i>We'll pick you up.</i>

02:13.673 --> 02:15.140
<i>In New York City,</i>

02:15.142 --> 02:16.876
<i>the dedicated detectives

02:16.878 --> 02:19.211
<i>these vicious felonies
are members of</i>

02:19.213 --> 02:21.514
<i>an elite squad known as
the Special Victims Unit.</i>

02:21.516 --> 02:23.415
<i>These are their stories.</i>

02:43.071 --> 02:44.469
Hello.

02:44.471 --> 02:46.206
<i>Ah, there you are.</i>

02:46.208 --> 02:47.272
Hello.

02:47.274 --> 02:48.373
- Hey, Peter.
- Sweetheart.

02:48.375 --> 02:49.641
Mom, you look radiant.

02:49.643 --> 02:50.877
- Thank you.
- Hi, Sheila.

02:50.879 --> 02:52.510
These are for Mom's bunions.

02:52.512 --> 02:54.479
If you want her
on her feet in two hours,

02:54.481 --> 02:55.914
you'll make sure
she wears those.

02:55.916 --> 02:58.084
<i>Thank you, darling.
That was sweet.</i>

02:58.086 --> 02:59.318
You know, Peter,

02:59.320 --> 03:01.888
if ever you start questioning
your sexuality,

03:01.890 --> 03:05.724
I'd love to introduce you
to my son, Jason.

03:05.726 --> 03:08.760
- He's got a tight little butt.
- Ooh.

03:08.762 --> 03:10.529
I'll be downstairs
if you need me.

03:10.531 --> 03:12.465
- Thank you, Sheila.
- Wow.

03:12.467 --> 03:13.934
Good to know.

03:15.035 --> 03:16.569
Good for Jason.

03:16.571 --> 03:18.771
Where's Ethan?

03:18.773 --> 03:21.576
Uh, he's here somewhere.
Happy as a clam.

03:23.376 --> 03:25.745
Oh, don't be discouraged.

03:25.747 --> 03:27.182
You're a great dad.

03:27.948 --> 03:29.480
Just love him

03:29.482 --> 03:31.751
and be there for him.

03:31.753 --> 03:34.589
And maybe loosen up a little.

03:35.223 --> 03:36.590
I'm loose.

03:38.093 --> 03:40.092
I mean...

03:40.094 --> 03:41.961
I'm loose, whatevs.

03:41.963 --> 03:43.829
Have you seen
your brother yet?

03:43.831 --> 03:46.365
Hmm? Oh, you invited him?

03:50.470 --> 03:52.638
Life is so crazy, man.

03:52.640 --> 03:55.741
One minute, you're napping
in Maui, unemployed,

03:55.743 --> 03:58.377
uneducated,
30 bucks to your name,

03:58.379 --> 04:00.712
the next minute, some guy's
walking up to you,

04:00.714 --> 04:02.581
asking if he can
put your picture

04:02.583 --> 04:04.682
on a barbeque sauce bottle.

04:04.684 --> 04:06.319
And the next minute

04:06.321 --> 04:09.121
they're giving you three cents
for every bottle they sell.

04:09.123 --> 04:10.323
And the next minute

04:10.325 --> 04:13.058
they're selling 30 million
of these bad boys.

04:13.060 --> 04:14.527
And then
the next minute...

04:14.529 --> 04:17.063
You're wearing
a white leather jacket

04:17.065 --> 04:20.031
and white high-tops
to your mom's wedding.

04:20.033 --> 04:21.199
Pete!

04:22.802 --> 04:24.903
It is so good to see you.

04:24.905 --> 04:27.172
I haven't seen this guy
in two years.

04:27.174 --> 04:28.507
Four. Actually.

04:28.509 --> 04:30.076
- Has it been that long?
- Mmm-hmm.

04:30.078 --> 04:32.644
Shut the front door.
Are you messing with me?

04:32.646 --> 04:33.946
He loves messing with me.

04:33.948 --> 04:36.048
- Are you messing with me?
- I'm not.

04:36.050 --> 04:37.382
God, you got to
come over to Hawaii.

04:37.384 --> 04:38.550
When are you gonna visit?

04:38.552 --> 04:40.420
- Yeah...
- Hey, Kaylani! Come here!

04:40.422 --> 04:42.788
I want you to meet someone
really special to me.

04:42.790 --> 04:44.757
Someone I've been
sleeping with exclusively

04:44.759 --> 04:46.257
for the past six months.

04:46.259 --> 04:47.726
Wow, six whole months?

04:47.728 --> 04:49.228
That's what I'm saying.

04:49.230 --> 04:51.262
It's really special.

04:51.264 --> 04:53.031
<i>Aloha,</i> Peter.

04:53.033 --> 04:54.235
Hi.

04:59.641 --> 05:01.076
Oh, okay.

05:09.984 --> 05:12.384
I can feel
your brother inside you.

05:12.386 --> 05:14.221
I am inside you.

05:15.122 --> 05:16.254
You are?

05:16.256 --> 05:17.656
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

05:17.658 --> 05:19.226
We're twins.

05:22.196 --> 05:24.696
That's called a <i>Honi.</i>

05:24.698 --> 05:27.399
That is a sacred
Hawaiian greeting

05:27.401 --> 05:29.168
that you just got.

05:29.170 --> 05:30.369
Yeah.

05:30.371 --> 05:31.971
Is that right?

05:31.973 --> 05:33.305
So,

05:33.307 --> 05:36.574
how psyched are you for Mom
finding true love again?

05:36.576 --> 05:38.110
It's awesome.

05:38.112 --> 05:41.016
God, I just wish Dad could've
been here to see this.

05:43.684 --> 05:45.084
<i>Yo, Uncle Kyle!</i>

05:45.086 --> 05:46.151
Yeah?

05:46.153 --> 05:47.285
You got to see this.

05:47.287 --> 05:48.756
What's your boy's name?

05:49.657 --> 05:51.156
It's Ethan.

05:51.158 --> 05:54.228
You gotta meet Ethan.
He is the best kid. Come on!

06:10.211 --> 06:11.744
<i>Do you take this man</i>

06:11.746 --> 06:14.379
<i>to be your lawfully
wedded husband?</i>

06:14.381 --> 06:18.153
<i>Do you take this woman to be
your lawfully wedded wife?</i>

06:19.453 --> 06:23.155
<i>I now pronounce you
husband and wife.</i>

06:23.157 --> 06:24.156
<i>Beautiful!</i>

06:24.158 --> 06:26.324
<i>You may kiss the bride.</i>

06:33.400 --> 06:34.703
<i>Clink, clink, clink!</i>

06:36.004 --> 06:38.105
<i>It's so nice to be here today.</i>

06:39.907 --> 06:42.740
<i>There's a saying
in Hawaii that goes</i>

06:42.742 --> 06:44.713
<i>a little something
like this...</i>

06:51.686 --> 06:54.119
<i>That translates
very simply as,</i>

06:54.121 --> 06:58.490
<i>"Life is alive once more
inside of me</i>

06:58.492 --> 07:00.692
<i>"from my love of you."</i>

07:00.694 --> 07:02.060
<i>And, Gene,</i>

07:02.062 --> 07:06.665
<i>my mother's life
is so alive right now</i>

07:06.667 --> 07:08.100
<i>with you inside her.</i>

07:08.102 --> 07:10.869
- <i>So, I want to raise a toast.</i>
- Hey now.

07:10.871 --> 07:13.241
<i>To mean Gene</i>

07:14.943 --> 07:17.012
<i>and the greatest mom on Earth.</i>

07:18.146 --> 07:21.480
<i>Cheers!
Hey,</i> l'chaim, <i>everybody!</i>

07:21.482 --> 07:23.281
<i>Thank you, darling.</i>

07:23.283 --> 07:24.885
<i>Cheers!</i>

07:26.687 --> 07:28.021
That went good.

07:28.023 --> 07:29.389
What?

07:29.391 --> 07:30.456
What?

07:30.458 --> 07:31.523
Yes.

07:31.525 --> 07:33.358
- No way!
- I'm serious.

07:33.360 --> 07:35.326
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
One more thing to say.

07:35.328 --> 07:36.728
Wait, everybody hold on.

07:36.730 --> 07:38.831
Forget about that 70-inch TV
we gave you

07:38.833 --> 07:42.201
because we've got
another wedding gift.

07:42.203 --> 07:44.569
<i>You're finally gonna
be a grandmother!</i>

07:44.571 --> 07:45.939
- Oh!
<i>- Yeah.</i>

07:47.107 --> 07:48.206
<i>Yes!</i>

07:48.208 --> 07:49.675
<i>I mean, a grandmother again!</i>

07:49.677 --> 07:51.644
<i>I'm sorry, Pete.</i>

07:59.886 --> 08:02.021
<i>My life is so perfect!</i>

<i>I told you, Detective,

08:10.763 --> 08:12.096
<i>Out of respect for...</i>

08:12.098 --> 08:15.468
<i>Shh. Let's cut to
the chase, Nigel.</i>

08:15.470 --> 08:17.071
<i>May I call you Nigel?</i>

08:19.372 --> 08:21.473
<i>You see, Nigel,</i>

08:21.475 --> 08:23.744
<i>I know that men have needs.</i>

08:25.213 --> 08:27.879
<i>But when a wife
can't fill those needs,</i>

08:27.881 --> 08:30.283
<i>men have to look elsewhere.</i>

08:30.285 --> 08:31.386
<i>Yes.</i>

08:46.499 --> 08:48.333
What the fuck?

08:48.335 --> 08:49.635
I need to talk
to both of you guys.

08:49.637 --> 08:51.204
- What?
- Okay.

08:51.206 --> 08:52.470
Mom, I need to talk to you.

08:52.472 --> 08:54.108
- Oh, okay.
- Thanks.

08:55.276 --> 08:57.209
- Boom!
<i>- What a beauty.</i>

08:57.211 --> 08:58.510
Boy, she is
such a good actress.

08:58.512 --> 08:59.679
Hot.

08:59.681 --> 09:01.850
No, no, not her.

09:02.316 --> 09:03.882
Boom.

09:03.884 --> 09:05.385
<i>- Now!</i>
- Mmm-hmm?

09:07.888 --> 09:09.921
Foot fetish.

09:09.923 --> 09:11.857
I like this guy.

09:11.859 --> 09:13.825
<i>No, no, not that.</i>

09:13.827 --> 09:15.295
<i>Don't you see the resemblance?</i>

09:16.864 --> 09:18.598
<i>The resemblance to who?</i>

09:18.600 --> 09:20.266
Our father!

09:20.268 --> 09:21.766
He's alive!

09:21.768 --> 09:23.234
<i>To our father?</i>

09:23.236 --> 09:25.871
Are you on acid
right now, Pete?

09:25.873 --> 09:28.640
No, Kyle,
look at his birthmark.

09:28.642 --> 09:31.142
<i>Yeah, I'm looking.</i>

09:31.144 --> 09:32.810
Mom, can you tell him
this isn't our father.

09:32.812 --> 09:34.380
He isn't your father.

09:34.382 --> 09:36.214
Mom, I've been
looking at his picture

09:36.216 --> 09:38.250
every day since I was
four years old.

09:38.252 --> 09:40.218
That birth mark
is unmistakable!

09:40.220 --> 09:41.619
Honey,
is everything okay?

09:41.621 --> 09:43.021
Well, Pete is, uh,

09:43.023 --> 09:44.824
lost touch with reality.

09:44.826 --> 09:47.693
The man in the photos
I gave you

09:47.695 --> 09:49.561
wasn't actually your father.

09:49.563 --> 09:50.630
Okay, what?

09:50.632 --> 09:51.833
What?

09:54.601 --> 09:57.603
Okay, he was a friend of mine
from college.

09:57.605 --> 09:59.872
<i>He was an English
exchange student.</i>

09:59.874 --> 10:01.439
<i>He went back after graduation.</i>

10:01.441 --> 10:03.776
<i>I just thought
you'd never see him.</i>

10:03.778 --> 10:04.910
He's not my dad?

10:04.912 --> 10:06.545
He was studying
to be a Botanist,

10:06.547 --> 10:07.713
for crying out loud.

10:07.715 --> 10:09.213
He's an orphan,

10:09.215 --> 10:11.050
and then he got colon cancer.

10:11.052 --> 10:12.253
<i>No.</i>

10:14.555 --> 10:17.289
I made up all those stories
about your father.

10:17.291 --> 10:20.693
<i>That he was an orphan,
that he came from England.</i>

10:20.695 --> 10:22.931
That he died of colon cancer.

10:23.430 --> 10:24.496
Wow.

10:24.498 --> 10:26.131
<i>The truth is,</i>

10:26.133 --> 10:30.736
and I probably should've
told you a long time ago...

10:30.738 --> 10:32.340
I think you should have.

10:34.175 --> 10:37.278
I wasn't sure
who your father was.

10:40.181 --> 10:41.615
How does that work?

10:42.615 --> 10:44.750
Yeah, how does that work?

10:44.752 --> 10:46.352
Well,

10:46.354 --> 10:48.152
you've got to understand...

10:48.154 --> 10:51.223
It was the '70s.
It was the crazy '70s.

10:51.225 --> 10:53.459
<i>It was disco era.</i>

10:53.461 --> 10:55.361
I was a young girl
living in New York.

10:55.363 --> 10:57.529
And if you went partying
in places

10:57.531 --> 11:00.065
like Studio 54...

11:00.067 --> 11:03.935
<i>And, you know, everybody
was high and fucking</i>

11:03.937 --> 11:06.704
and monogamy wasn't
exactly a priority.

11:06.706 --> 11:10.175
I mean, you just go in there
and the mood, it would...

11:10.177 --> 11:12.143
<i>♪ Baby tonight
Hot stuff ♪</i>

11:12.145 --> 11:13.344
Remember that?

11:13.346 --> 11:14.747
And then,
you know, you just...

11:14.749 --> 11:16.548
<i>- We get it.</i>
- All these great people

11:16.550 --> 11:18.483
in exactly the same situation
you were,

11:18.485 --> 11:20.518
feeling exactly the same thing
you were in.

11:20.520 --> 11:22.420
You would dance with them,
you know,

11:22.422 --> 11:24.055
and then you go and you just,

11:24.057 --> 11:26.257
you know,
you'd sleep with them.

11:26.259 --> 11:29.527
It's true. The priority
was smoking weed and fucking.

11:29.529 --> 11:30.595
<i>Well, sure, yeah.</i>

11:30.597 --> 11:32.131
<i>Studio 54?</i>

11:32.133 --> 11:34.165
- How awesome is that?
- Yeah.

11:34.167 --> 11:35.666
<i>Awesome?</i>

11:35.668 --> 11:37.369
You think this is awesome?

11:37.371 --> 11:39.405
<i>Well, it's not not awesome.</i>

11:39.407 --> 11:42.473
It helps to explain
my zest for love making.

11:42.475 --> 11:44.645
<i>I've always wondered
where I got that from.</i>

11:47.114 --> 11:48.713
Now we know.

11:48.715 --> 11:52.084
I spent my whole life trying
to honor my father's memory.

11:52.086 --> 11:53.452
And you have.

11:53.454 --> 11:54.853
<i>What memory?</i>

11:54.855 --> 11:57.423
I stare at assholes
all day long

11:57.425 --> 12:00.726
because of a fictional man's
colon cancer.

12:00.728 --> 12:03.494
Pete, could you pivot
into plastic surgery

12:03.496 --> 12:05.864
or something
less butt-related.

12:05.866 --> 12:08.366
I mean, you're really smart,
I don't see why not.

12:08.368 --> 12:10.868
Kyle, how are you
not freaking out right now?

12:10.870 --> 12:12.204
Okay, that's not fair!

12:12.206 --> 12:13.472
You can't tell people
how to freak out.

12:13.474 --> 12:15.173
Now I want everybody
to calm down, all right?

12:15.175 --> 12:17.108
I am so sorry, you guys,

12:17.110 --> 12:18.510
but the light is
going quickly.

12:18.512 --> 12:20.212
It's the last chance
for family photos.

12:20.214 --> 12:21.715
Not a good time, Annie!

12:22.917 --> 12:24.348
It's a perfect time, Annie.

12:24.350 --> 12:25.584
Okay, just get
a little bit tighter

12:25.586 --> 12:27.018
and we'll get
a nice family shot.

12:27.020 --> 12:29.320
Oh, you guys look so good.
Hold on.

12:29.322 --> 12:30.923
<i>This looks perfect.</i>

12:30.925 --> 12:32.226
<i>Oh, so good!</i>

12:33.293 --> 12:35.193
That is going to be
a good one.

12:35.195 --> 12:36.328
You can't leave just yet.

12:36.330 --> 12:37.996
We need Mom and her sons.

12:37.998 --> 12:39.698
Oh, good idea.

12:39.700 --> 12:41.502
Okay. Come back up here.

12:42.702 --> 12:45.636
I'm gonna need you guys
looking forward,

12:45.638 --> 12:47.138
<i>big smiles.</i>

12:47.140 --> 12:48.272
<i>Perfect, Kyle.</i>

12:48.274 --> 12:49.974
<i>Oh, my God, Dr. Reynolds...</i>

12:49.976 --> 12:52.776
This means he's out there.

12:52.778 --> 12:54.779
He's out there somewhere.

12:54.781 --> 12:56.314
Not now, Peter.

12:56.316 --> 12:58.516
Dr. Reynolds, if I can get you
looking at the camera.

12:58.518 --> 13:01.420
He's been out there
this whole time.

13:01.422 --> 13:03.854
That is true. I mean,
who do you think it was?

13:03.856 --> 13:05.257
As we got older, surely...

13:05.259 --> 13:06.657
Was there someone that we
started to remind you of?

13:06.659 --> 13:08.459
Just stop it.
Will you just please stop it.

13:08.461 --> 13:11.796
None of the men I was with
would have made a good father.

13:11.798 --> 13:13.431
I was trying to protect you.

13:13.433 --> 13:15.132
Protect yourself more like it.

13:15.134 --> 13:17.301
Hey, wait a minute.

13:17.303 --> 13:20.572
I need a name.
I think you owe me a name.

13:20.574 --> 13:21.640
I think you...

13:21.642 --> 13:23.508
<i>Hey, Reynolds!</i>

13:23.510 --> 13:25.245
Camera! Now!

13:26.513 --> 13:28.713
<i>Perfect.</i>

13:28.715 --> 13:30.848
We got it.

13:30.850 --> 13:32.316
Fucking thank you.

13:32.318 --> 13:34.621
I can't talk
about this now, Peter.

13:35.956 --> 13:39.190
Okay, she... Mom has spoken.

13:39.192 --> 13:41.992
Pete, you're spinning
out of control literally.

13:41.994 --> 13:43.295
Just calm down.

13:43.297 --> 13:44.662
Stop telling me to calm down!

13:44.664 --> 13:45.896
Okay?

13:45.898 --> 13:48.333
I just need to know this!

13:48.335 --> 13:50.868
Just give me something.

13:50.870 --> 13:52.139
Please.

13:53.139 --> 13:54.641
Terry Bradshaw.

13:57.778 --> 13:59.978
Four-time Super Bowl champion,
Terry Bradshaw?

13:59.980 --> 14:01.512
Yeah.

14:01.514 --> 14:03.882
The Enterprise Rent-A-Car
spokesman, Terry Bradshaw?

14:03.884 --> 14:06.351
Fox sports TV commentator,
Terry Bradshaw?

14:06.353 --> 14:08.119
Yep. Terry Bradshaw.

14:08.121 --> 14:09.720
No, no, no.

14:09.722 --> 14:11.790
That's insane!

14:11.792 --> 14:13.925
We started dating

14:13.927 --> 14:15.292
the fall of '74,

14:15.294 --> 14:16.862
just after he gave up

14:16.864 --> 14:20.401
his starting position
to Joe Gilliam.

14:22.603 --> 14:25.170
There's no way she would know
who Joe Gilliam was.

14:25.172 --> 14:26.304
Pete!

14:26.306 --> 14:27.638
Wait, Mom, this is...

14:27.640 --> 14:29.440
Do you realize
how incredible this is?

14:29.442 --> 14:31.376
This is the guy
you loved growing up!

14:31.378 --> 14:33.779
Gene, he had every poster
on the wall!

14:33.781 --> 14:36.714
- I know...
- Can I get a smile now?

14:36.716 --> 14:38.316
Now, will you relax?

14:38.318 --> 14:40.785
- I love Terry Bradshaw.
- I know!

14:40.787 --> 14:42.154
<i>He's the greatest!</i>

14:42.156 --> 14:43.354
- Yeah.
- Yup.

14:43.356 --> 14:45.390
Which raises
the inevitable question,

14:45.392 --> 14:48.160
why did you not

14:48.162 --> 14:49.994
tell us

14:49.996 --> 14:53.166
that the coolest man on Earth
was our father?

14:54.701 --> 14:57.001
Well, he wasn't

14:57.003 --> 14:59.273
the man you saw on TV.

15:01.841 --> 15:03.311
He was violent.

15:04.345 --> 15:05.877
He hit you?

15:05.879 --> 15:07.114
No.

15:08.282 --> 15:10.147
But as a football player

15:10.149 --> 15:13.852
he was frequently violent.

15:13.854 --> 15:15.152
As a football player?

15:15.154 --> 15:16.857
Yeah, on Sundays.

15:17.758 --> 15:19.326
Sometimes Monday nights.

15:19.961 --> 15:22.393
Oh, on game days

15:22.395 --> 15:23.661
he was violent... I got it.

15:23.663 --> 15:25.463
Yeah, because
that was his job.

15:25.465 --> 15:27.299
That's what he did
for a living!

15:29.003 --> 15:30.702
Oh, my God!

15:30.704 --> 15:33.472
Do you have any idea what
my life might have been like

15:33.474 --> 15:35.806
with Terry Bradshaw
in the picture?

15:35.808 --> 15:38.143
I might even be
in the NFL right now!

15:38.145 --> 15:39.544
- Oh, come on!
- Well, we don't know!

15:39.546 --> 15:40.912
You didn't even make
our middle school team.

15:40.914 --> 15:43.147
That's because
I didn't have Terry Bradshaw

15:43.149 --> 15:44.449
teaching me the fundamentals.

15:44.451 --> 15:47.785
Oh, Peter, please,
just please...

15:47.787 --> 15:52.123
My life is basically
crap right now,

15:52.125 --> 15:54.828
and it's your fault.

15:55.796 --> 15:57.297
That's not fair.

15:57.864 --> 16:00.531
<i>Pete. Hey!</i>

16:00.533 --> 16:02.802
Mom, let me talk to him.

16:03.936 --> 16:06.070
<i>Hey, Pete!</i>

16:06.072 --> 16:07.372
<i>Pete, come here for a second.</i>

16:07.374 --> 16:09.473
<i>Hey, Pete,
where are you going?</i>

16:09.475 --> 16:11.776
Come on, you got to apologize.

16:11.778 --> 16:12.877
Apologize for what?

16:12.879 --> 16:15.780
Well, you're being
really tough on Mom.

16:15.782 --> 16:18.816
Hey, what are you doing?
No! You're not driving.

16:18.818 --> 16:21.954
Look, maybe I blew
my stack at Mom.

16:21.956 --> 16:23.555
It's just...

16:23.557 --> 16:25.623
She kept Dad from us.

16:25.625 --> 16:26.858
I know.

16:26.860 --> 16:28.160
What the hell?

16:28.162 --> 16:32.231
You know how many times
I just wanted to know him?

16:32.233 --> 16:35.566
I just wanted him
there to ask about

16:35.568 --> 16:39.305
Ethan, about Katherine,
about...

16:39.307 --> 16:41.973
About everything, you know?

16:41.975 --> 16:43.675
Yeah, I know how much
you wanted that.

16:43.677 --> 16:47.581
Yeah, I don't think you do,
man. I just... Well...

16:52.519 --> 16:55.152
I can talk to him.

16:55.154 --> 16:56.656
- Yeah.
- It's Terry Bradshaw.

16:59.392 --> 17:00.761
I'm gonna go find him.

17:01.561 --> 17:02.928
I'm gonna find Dad.

17:02.930 --> 17:04.429
Great! Let's do it.

17:04.431 --> 17:06.230
- Oh, no. You can't come.
- Oh, I'm coming.

17:06.232 --> 17:07.364
You never gave
a shit about Dad.

17:07.366 --> 17:09.233
He's my father, too!

17:09.236 --> 17:11.268
I don't take
my orders from you.

17:11.270 --> 17:12.703
I take them from the universe.

17:12.704 --> 17:15.406
And the universe wants us
to go together.

17:15.409 --> 17:16.775
You're not coming.

17:16.777 --> 17:18.276
Wait, hold on,
wait, who was that?

17:18.278 --> 17:20.411
Hello, yes?

17:20.413 --> 17:22.080
It's the universe?

17:22.083 --> 17:23.582
Yeah.

17:23.584 --> 17:26.617
You want me
to go with my brother?

17:26.619 --> 17:29.153
Pete doesn't want me to go.

17:29.155 --> 17:31.589
Fuck him?

17:31.591 --> 17:33.524
I know.
You said it with a wink.

17:33.526 --> 17:36.227
Okay. I love you, too.

17:36.229 --> 17:38.430
That was the universe.

17:38.432 --> 17:39.634
Now where does he live?

17:40.401 --> 17:41.602
Miami.

17:42.303 --> 17:43.634
Done. Miami.

17:43.636 --> 17:45.969
That's where we meet him.

17:45.971 --> 17:49.141
- We're going to Miami.
- God damn it. Yes!

17:49.143 --> 17:50.441
- Come on!
- Fine.

17:50.443 --> 17:53.748
You can come,
but don't be annoying.

17:57.584 --> 18:00.251
Let me look at you. Kiss.

18:02.455 --> 18:04.689
Okay, what's our plan?

18:04.691 --> 18:07.391
Um, we're still in good shape.

18:07.393 --> 18:09.393
Mr. Bradshaw will be

18:09.395 --> 18:10.996
at the grand opening

18:10.998 --> 18:13.997
of North Miami Beach
Bradshaw Motors.

18:13.999 --> 18:15.766
- Yeah.
- This afternoon.

18:15.768 --> 18:17.936
Okay, well, that's where
we're gonna meet him.

18:17.938 --> 18:19.203
Yup.

18:19.205 --> 18:20.872
By the way, thank you
for letting me upgrade us.

18:20.874 --> 18:22.807
I think you're gonna
love first class.

18:22.809 --> 18:24.543
I think it's kind of
a waste of money.

18:24.545 --> 18:25.843
Not when it's my money.

18:25.845 --> 18:28.447
Look, Pete,
money is never wasted

18:28.449 --> 18:30.981
when it's spent on
the ones you love.

18:30.983 --> 18:32.516
Like a brother.

18:32.518 --> 18:34.887
<i>Or a jet ski.</i>

18:34.889 --> 18:36.957
Or a party boat.

18:38.159 --> 18:40.225
<i>Push play. Can I see that?</i>

18:40.227 --> 18:42.960
<i>I hate to run.
But not running is worse.</i>

18:42.962 --> 18:45.497
<i>So, if I've got to run, it's
going to be in the most...</i>

18:45.499 --> 18:47.966
Look at that Adonis.

18:47.968 --> 18:49.167
That's our dad.

18:49.169 --> 18:51.236
I can't believe it.

18:51.238 --> 18:52.370
Mr. Reynolds...

18:52.372 --> 18:54.005
Oh, and Mr. Reynolds.

18:54.007 --> 18:55.740
- Are you guys married?
- No.

18:55.742 --> 18:57.543
We're just watching some
footage on our father.

18:57.545 --> 18:58.977
We're on our way
to meet him

18:58.979 --> 19:00.277
for the very first time.

19:00.279 --> 19:03.515
So, we're a little nervous
and a whole lot excited.

19:03.517 --> 19:05.584
Aren't you
just the sweetest thing.

19:05.586 --> 19:07.018
If you think I'm sweet,

19:07.020 --> 19:08.786
let me introduce you
to big bro here.

19:08.788 --> 19:10.721
He is like a ripe
honeydew melon.

19:10.723 --> 19:12.224
Ooh. A honeydew, huh?

19:12.226 --> 19:13.459
I love honeydews.

19:13.461 --> 19:15.259
Yeah, they're really yummy.

19:15.261 --> 19:16.861
They're delicious.

19:16.863 --> 19:19.430
There is this thing, though,
you should know about fruit.

19:19.432 --> 19:21.799
A lot of melons in particular.
The skin

19:21.801 --> 19:24.369
is a breeding ground
for bacteria,

19:24.371 --> 19:25.670
E.coli and stuff.

19:25.672 --> 19:27.705
It's just something
to be aware of, you know.

19:27.707 --> 19:29.774
Something to keep in mind

19:29.776 --> 19:33.010
in your fruit-related
endeavors moving forward.

19:33.012 --> 19:34.312
He's a doctor.

19:34.314 --> 19:36.448
Always saving lives.

19:36.450 --> 19:37.748
Oh, a doctor.

19:37.750 --> 19:40.751
Dr. Reynolds.

19:40.753 --> 19:41.853
- I'll be careful.
- Yes.

19:41.855 --> 19:44.087
You're welcome. Be careful.

19:46.058 --> 19:47.391
God!

19:47.393 --> 19:48.960
What are you doing?

19:48.962 --> 19:49.827
What?

19:49.829 --> 19:51.328
You guys had some chemistry.

19:51.330 --> 19:53.865
I was trying to facilitate it.

19:53.867 --> 19:56.500
I think it's called
being a wingman.

19:56.502 --> 19:59.705
I don't need a wingman.
All right?

19:59.707 --> 20:01.905
I'm not on this trip
to get laid.

20:01.907 --> 20:03.240
Come on.

20:03.242 --> 20:05.910
There was a little electricity
there between you two.

20:05.912 --> 20:06.878
Did you notice

20:06.880 --> 20:08.846
a little chemistry there
between them?

20:08.848 --> 20:11.815
I bet she's a real cock tease.

20:11.817 --> 20:13.517
Yeah, right. Stop projecting.

20:13.519 --> 20:15.053
Listen,

20:15.055 --> 20:18.155
how many women have you
been with since the divorce?

20:18.157 --> 20:19.159
Ten?

20:20.027 --> 20:21.491
Yup. Ten.

20:21.493 --> 20:23.394
And it's been a year?

20:23.396 --> 20:26.297
- Three.
- Ten in three years?

20:26.299 --> 20:27.500
Yeah.

20:31.371 --> 20:34.139
I'm really sorry.
I had no idea.

20:34.141 --> 20:36.807
I'm being sarcastic.

20:36.809 --> 20:39.777
I haven't had sex with anyone
since Katherine.

20:39.779 --> 20:43.648
I haven't had sex with anyone
besides Katherine.

20:43.650 --> 20:45.249
We got married in college.

20:45.251 --> 20:46.351
Remember?

20:46.353 --> 20:47.654
What?

20:56.962 --> 20:59.664
<i>Welcome to
Miami International Airport.</i>

20:59.666 --> 21:02.234
Peter, Peter, Peter,
is it like a physical thing?

21:02.236 --> 21:04.535
- What?
- Is it like a blood flow?

21:04.537 --> 21:06.103
God, no!

21:06.105 --> 21:08.273
No, my penis is fine!

21:08.275 --> 21:09.407
Well, what is the deal?

21:09.409 --> 21:10.641
Ever since the divorce,

21:10.643 --> 21:12.009
I've been a little
depressed, okay?

21:12.011 --> 21:14.178
That makes sense.
And it just...

21:14.180 --> 21:15.279
Don't patronize me, okay?

21:15.281 --> 21:16.914
You wouldn't know
anything about that.

21:16.916 --> 21:18.682
Of course I do.
You don't think I know

21:18.684 --> 21:20.052
what it's like
to be depressed?

21:20.054 --> 21:22.687
The saddest
I've ever seen you is like...

21:22.689 --> 21:25.055
I've never seen you sad!

21:25.057 --> 21:26.356
You can't get into
a contest...

21:26.358 --> 21:27.691
That is actually sad.

21:27.693 --> 21:28.526
...on who's more sad
than the other guy.

21:28.528 --> 21:29.628
That's weird!

21:29.630 --> 21:31.930
No. It's weird
that you keep...

21:31.932 --> 21:34.032
Dr. Reynolds, good luck
meeting your father.

21:34.034 --> 21:36.701
Thanks. Good luck
with your uniform.

21:40.007 --> 21:42.439
No, I'm not going to let you
do that anymore.

21:42.441 --> 21:43.741
Do what?

21:43.743 --> 21:45.910
Just deliberately
self-sabotage. Okay?

21:45.912 --> 21:48.112
The top mission
is still bonding with Dad.

21:48.114 --> 21:50.047
Sub-mission
is getting you laid.

21:50.049 --> 21:53.118
Mission below that is gonna be
having stone crabs.

21:53.120 --> 21:55.623
Mission below that,
swimming with dolphins.

22:02.628 --> 22:04.128
<i>Hey, when we
get to the dealership,</i>

22:04.130 --> 22:05.964
<i>you have to do
all the talking.</i>

22:05.966 --> 22:08.599
<i>You cannot be nervous,
Peter. He's a regular guy,</i>

22:08.601 --> 22:10.602
<i>just like us.</i>

22:10.604 --> 22:12.202
There you go.

22:12.204 --> 22:13.371
Thank you.

22:13.373 --> 22:15.172
Don't forget to buy a car.

22:15.174 --> 22:16.674
Just kidding.

22:16.676 --> 22:18.276
Hey, fellas, how you doing?

22:18.278 --> 22:19.943
Hi, Terry Bradshaw.

22:19.945 --> 22:21.749
Yeah.

22:29.690 --> 22:31.091
Is he okay?

22:32.558 --> 22:34.825
Aw! Bless his heart.

22:34.827 --> 22:36.661
You're one of my special fans,
aren't you?

22:36.663 --> 22:38.063
Hey, bub.

22:38.065 --> 22:39.897
How you doing? God bless you.

22:39.899 --> 22:41.466
Oh, no. He's not special.

22:41.468 --> 22:43.368
No, no. I am special, Pete.

22:43.370 --> 22:45.205
We're both special.

22:50.343 --> 22:51.776
Do I know you?

22:51.778 --> 22:54.078
Oh, I don't think so.
I'd remember.

22:54.080 --> 22:56.381
Really? Are you sure?

22:56.383 --> 22:59.016
You really do look familiar.

22:59.018 --> 23:00.518
- Show him.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

23:00.520 --> 23:02.152
Well, um...

23:02.154 --> 23:05.390
Do you remember a woman
named Helen Baxter?

23:05.392 --> 23:07.227
Helen Baxter?

23:08.327 --> 23:10.295
Helen Baxter...

23:10.297 --> 23:12.132
Oh, my God.

23:15.035 --> 23:16.103
Wow.

23:16.702 --> 23:18.202
God.

23:18.204 --> 23:21.305
Well, talk about
a blast from the past.

23:24.577 --> 23:27.144
This woman was something else.

23:27.146 --> 23:29.314
She had the tightest ass
you've ever seen.

23:29.316 --> 23:30.681
I mean, awesome.

23:30.683 --> 23:32.920
Yeah, but Helen was
much more than that.

23:33.554 --> 23:35.420
She had a mouth.

23:35.422 --> 23:36.688
Oh!

23:36.690 --> 23:39.224
And a tongue. Oh!

23:39.226 --> 23:41.692
And I'm telling you,

23:41.694 --> 23:44.094
it damn near cost us
the Super Bowl.

23:44.096 --> 23:48.099
Well, Mom was
a Browns fan so...

23:48.101 --> 23:50.168
Did you say
that Helen is your mother?

23:50.170 --> 23:51.501
Yeah.

23:51.503 --> 23:54.139
Well, technically, I said it,
sir, because we're...

23:54.141 --> 23:56.807
We're both her sons.
We're twins.

23:56.809 --> 23:58.678
You're Helen Baxter's son?

23:59.412 --> 24:01.478
We're both her boys, yes.

24:01.480 --> 24:02.714
That is...

24:02.716 --> 24:05.316
That is what
we are saying. Yes.

24:05.318 --> 24:06.653
How is she?

24:08.055 --> 24:10.255
- Well, she's great.
- Yeah.

24:10.257 --> 24:12.422
You know, uh,
she just got married.

24:12.424 --> 24:16.228
And she's a lot different
than how you remember her.

24:16.230 --> 24:17.327
That's for sure.

24:17.329 --> 24:19.530
Just a little.

24:19.532 --> 24:20.900
Oh, my...

24:23.336 --> 24:24.704
<i>Say it.</i>

24:25.605 --> 24:27.141
Say it.

24:29.041 --> 24:30.910
You're my son, aren't you?

24:32.578 --> 24:34.344
I... I think so.

24:34.346 --> 24:36.247
Well, technically,
we both are because,

24:36.249 --> 24:38.349
like I was saying earlier,
we're twins.

24:38.351 --> 24:40.384
We're both her sons.

24:40.386 --> 24:42.687
You're my son.

24:42.689 --> 24:43.957
Yes.

24:49.028 --> 24:50.995
Come here. Come here.

24:50.997 --> 24:54.368
Oh, this is just amazing.

24:55.868 --> 24:57.970
Oh, my God.

25:01.208 --> 25:03.874
I had no idea
that she was even pregnant.

25:03.876 --> 25:05.375
You gotta believe me.
Helen never...

25:05.377 --> 25:06.478
She never said a word.

25:06.480 --> 25:08.513
We know. Don't worry about it.

25:08.515 --> 25:10.046
I mean, I can't believe this.

25:10.048 --> 25:12.350
I mean, you guys have been
out there the whole time.

25:12.352 --> 25:14.185
- It's really emotional.
- I know, yeah.

25:14.187 --> 25:17.388
I already have a son.
His name is Trent.

25:17.390 --> 25:19.390
But he's kind of a nob.
Do you know what I'm saying?

25:19.392 --> 25:20.791
So is my son.

25:20.793 --> 25:23.027
Oh, man.
Do you have any plans?

25:23.029 --> 25:24.362
You guys got anything to do?

25:24.364 --> 25:25.563
No.

25:25.565 --> 25:27.032
Look, why don't you come over
to the house,

25:27.034 --> 25:28.565
and we'll have
some food and drinks.

25:28.567 --> 25:30.000
- What do you say?
- That would be incredible.

25:30.002 --> 25:31.436
- Great. Yeah.
- Okay?

25:31.438 --> 25:32.469
Uh...

25:32.471 --> 25:34.372
Pete, why don't you
ride with me.

25:34.374 --> 25:37.342
And, Donald... Donald,
you can just follow, okay?

25:37.344 --> 25:38.709
Okay. It's Kyle.

25:38.711 --> 25:39.843
Is this your car?

25:39.845 --> 25:42.447
Yeah. This is a '75 Stingray.

25:42.449 --> 25:43.948
It's my favorite car!
Literally!

25:43.950 --> 25:45.683
You like it? Really?

25:45.685 --> 25:47.818
Here. You drive.

25:47.820 --> 25:49.387
Donald,
see if you can keep up.

25:49.389 --> 25:51.890
- It's still Kyle.
- Come on. Let's go.

25:51.892 --> 25:54.327
You like this, huh?

26:06.072 --> 26:08.672
This is amazing, Mr. Bradshaw!

26:08.674 --> 26:09.806
Please.

26:09.808 --> 26:12.176
Just call me Terry, okay?

26:12.178 --> 26:14.211
All right!
Well then Terry it is!

26:14.213 --> 26:15.412
Whoo!

26:15.414 --> 26:17.914
Okay,
take it easy, lead foot.

26:17.916 --> 26:20.052
I'm in a Ford Focus here.

26:20.886 --> 26:23.156
Damn it, slow it down!

26:39.306 --> 26:41.305
<i>Hey, hey, I'm home!</i>

26:41.307 --> 26:43.007
Did you pick up the
fresh garlic I needed?

26:43.009 --> 26:44.441
The fresh garlic.

26:44.443 --> 26:46.143
<i>No, I didn't get
the fresh garlic.</i>

26:46.145 --> 26:47.644
Got something better, though.

26:47.646 --> 26:48.947
Oh, what did you pick up?

26:48.949 --> 26:51.716
I picked up a son.

26:51.718 --> 26:53.351
Pete. Say hi, Pete.

26:53.353 --> 26:54.419
Hi.

26:54.421 --> 26:55.519
How are you?

26:55.521 --> 26:56.923
Pete.

26:58.924 --> 27:00.959
This is a joke. Right?

27:00.961 --> 27:02.626
No, no, this is not a joke.

27:02.628 --> 27:05.596
His mother and I used to have
unprotected sex all the time.

27:05.598 --> 27:06.765
Don't worry, Pete. All right?

27:06.767 --> 27:08.932
She knows
all about my crazy past.

27:08.934 --> 27:10.868
I'm Peter Reynolds.
So glad to meet you.

27:10.870 --> 27:13.370
It's nice to meet you, Peter.

27:13.372 --> 27:16.173
Sweetie, could I have a word
with you in the kitchen?

27:16.175 --> 27:18.075
- Me? Okay.
- Yeah.

27:18.077 --> 27:20.311
Hey, Pete,
make yourself at home.

27:20.313 --> 27:22.846
My home is
your home now.

27:22.848 --> 27:24.347
My home is your home now.

27:24.349 --> 27:25.682
- Can you believe I said that?
- Yeah, I heard that.

27:25.684 --> 27:27.185
I think we need to,
kind of, just talk.

27:27.187 --> 27:29.019
<i>What?
What do you wanna talk...</i>

27:29.021 --> 27:31.389
Listen, sweetie,
this is insane, okay?

27:31.391 --> 27:34.324
You can't just invite somebody
into our home.

27:34.326 --> 27:35.825
I mean, he could be, like,

27:35.827 --> 27:37.428
a con artist
looking for money.

27:37.430 --> 27:39.497
- Money? You're serious?
- Yes. Did you think about...

27:39.499 --> 27:40.765
- Yes.
- No way.

27:40.767 --> 27:42.065
Pete!

27:42.067 --> 27:43.535
Do you need money?

27:43.537 --> 27:45.870
Are you here to rob us?

27:45.872 --> 27:47.705
Oh, no, I'm good.

27:47.707 --> 27:49.209
I'm a physician actually.

27:50.477 --> 27:51.977
Did you hear that?

27:51.979 --> 27:54.645
My boy is a doctor.

27:54.647 --> 27:57.382
You're a doctor, son.
Proud of you!

27:57.384 --> 27:58.449
Thanks!

27:58.451 --> 28:00.051
<i>I've got
a doctor in my family.</i>

28:00.053 --> 28:02.589
Go deep, Pete! Deep, deep!

28:06.526 --> 28:08.192
Nice grab, Pete!

28:08.194 --> 28:10.394
Atta boy! Great catch, son.

28:10.396 --> 28:12.465
Way to go, babe.

28:13.999 --> 28:16.366
I gotta tell you, Pete.

28:16.368 --> 28:19.570
Had a bit of a colon cancer
scare a few years back.

28:19.572 --> 28:20.737
- Really?
- Yeah.

28:20.739 --> 28:23.807
Thank God I had a good GI doc.

28:23.809 --> 28:27.344
I know you guys, you know,
you catch a lot of guff.

28:27.346 --> 28:30.081
But, man,
it's a noble profession.

28:30.083 --> 28:31.685
Noble as heck.

28:33.385 --> 28:35.254
Really appreciate
you're saying that.

28:35.887 --> 28:38.189
Really do.

28:38.191 --> 28:39.590
Be cool, man.

28:39.592 --> 28:41.891
You know, when I first came
into the league,

28:41.893 --> 28:43.861
I was a bit of a hot head.

28:43.863 --> 28:46.730
I mean, it didn't take so much
as a slight breeze,

28:46.732 --> 28:48.833
and God, I'd go off.

28:48.835 --> 28:50.801
Hey, say hello to this guy.

28:50.803 --> 28:53.537
Mr. Powder Keg.
Horrible temper.

28:53.539 --> 28:54.671
Shut the fuck up.

28:54.673 --> 28:56.007
<i>Your mother, boy,</i>

28:56.009 --> 28:59.343
she had this amazing
patience about her.

28:59.345 --> 29:02.714
She had this way of channeling
all my anger

29:02.716 --> 29:04.314
into things that were good.

29:04.316 --> 29:07.153
Not only on the field,
but, you know, off the field.

29:07.820 --> 29:09.320
<i>God!</i>

29:09.322 --> 29:12.855
That woman
just drove me crazy sometimes.

29:12.857 --> 29:14.959
That sounds like Mom.

29:14.961 --> 29:16.660
I know one thing.

29:16.662 --> 29:19.764
I wouldn't have made it
through a single season

29:19.766 --> 29:21.798
had it not been for your mom.

29:21.800 --> 29:23.601
That's the truth.

29:23.603 --> 29:25.603
God, I loved that woman.

29:25.605 --> 29:27.138
<i>I really did.</i>

29:27.140 --> 29:28.575
Wow. That's...

29:30.242 --> 29:32.144
That's beautiful.

29:32.945 --> 29:34.312
Hey, Terry.

29:34.314 --> 29:35.912
Hey, you want to see
someone who can catch,

29:35.914 --> 29:37.448
hit me on a bomb.

29:37.450 --> 29:39.086
Go, go.

29:45.258 --> 29:46.356
Oh!

29:47.660 --> 29:49.196
God!

29:51.832 --> 29:53.698
Sorry, son.

29:53.700 --> 29:55.799
Old habits die hard.

29:55.801 --> 29:57.868
Rod Hamilton.

29:57.870 --> 29:59.335
Big fan.

29:59.337 --> 30:01.237
I played 10 years
with that guy.

30:01.239 --> 30:02.507
He missed me so much,

30:02.509 --> 30:04.307
the bastard
moved in next door.

30:04.309 --> 30:07.277
Hey! You still got it, Rod!

30:07.279 --> 30:08.749
He caught the ball.

30:10.849 --> 30:12.016
I love it.

30:12.018 --> 30:14.352
He's still on the juice, baby.

30:14.354 --> 30:17.188
He's still on the juice.

30:21.193 --> 30:22.326
To Rod.

30:22.328 --> 30:24.228
<i>Just demolished you.</i>

30:24.230 --> 30:25.895
You son of a bitch.

30:25.897 --> 30:28.099
You need some Advil.

30:28.101 --> 30:29.299
Hey, Rod.

30:29.301 --> 30:32.135
Does the name
Helen Baxter ring a bell?

30:32.137 --> 30:33.336
Ring a bell?

30:33.338 --> 30:35.305
It does more than ring a bell.

30:35.307 --> 30:37.275
I think I just
came in my pants.

30:37.277 --> 30:39.109
- No, Rod...
- Damn, man.

30:39.111 --> 30:40.411
That woman could fuck.

30:40.413 --> 30:41.978
Oh, Rod,
you really might...

30:41.980 --> 30:43.247
Look, the woman

30:43.249 --> 30:45.749
was like a dick whisperer.

30:45.751 --> 30:48.885
Like, she'd get all up inside
the head of the dick

30:48.887 --> 30:50.755
and know exactly
what it wanted.

30:50.757 --> 30:53.323
Yeah, she'd get
all up in that shaft,

30:53.325 --> 30:54.824
and then in them balls

30:54.826 --> 30:56.826
<i>and in the tip.</i>

30:56.828 --> 30:59.797
Ooh. I'm getting hard
just thinking about it.

30:59.799 --> 31:02.834
So, what makes you think
about Helen Baxter?

31:02.836 --> 31:04.570
- She's our mom.
- Yeah.

31:05.838 --> 31:07.337
I don't know no Helen Baxter.

31:07.339 --> 31:08.738
Sounds like you did.

31:08.740 --> 31:10.542
All we did was cuddle.

31:10.544 --> 31:11.875
Word.

31:11.877 --> 31:15.379
It's okay, Rod,
you didn't know.

31:15.381 --> 31:18.149
It's a little awkward,
but, yeah, she's our mom.

31:18.151 --> 31:21.251
Hey, Rod, turns out,

31:21.253 --> 31:22.553
I'm their father.

31:22.555 --> 31:23.787
<i>- That's right.</i>
- How about that?

31:23.789 --> 31:25.590
These are my boys.
How about that?

31:25.592 --> 31:27.758
- Whoa!
<i>- Yeah!</i>

31:27.760 --> 31:29.192
Congratulations.

31:29.194 --> 31:30.862
Thank you. Cheers.

31:30.864 --> 31:34.363
Evidently, I knocked Helen up
sometime after Super Bowl IX.

31:34.365 --> 31:35.632
Yeah, we were reading,

31:35.634 --> 31:37.301
that's when you went off
to Australia

31:37.303 --> 31:39.437
to record the country
and western album.

31:39.439 --> 31:43.007
<i>Cowboys and Kangaroos,</i>
I believe was the name.

31:43.009 --> 31:44.275
That shit was awful,
wasn't it?

31:44.277 --> 31:45.543
You realize what that means...

31:45.545 --> 31:46.410
What?

31:46.412 --> 31:48.344
We were conceived
in Australia.

31:48.346 --> 31:50.180
- Yeah.
- We're Aussies.

31:50.182 --> 31:51.282
Out in the outback.

31:51.284 --> 31:52.752
No, Pete.

31:53.853 --> 31:55.887
You know,
now that I think of it,

31:55.889 --> 31:58.322
<i>Helen didn't make that trip.</i>

31:58.324 --> 32:00.224
<i>We got in this big fight</i>

32:00.226 --> 32:02.927
'cause she didn't
have a passport.

32:02.929 --> 32:03.995
God, I was such a jerk to her.

32:03.997 --> 32:05.595
<i>Wait, wait.</i>

32:05.597 --> 32:08.632
Isn't that when she started
dating the Wall Street guy?

32:08.634 --> 32:10.034
Yeah, that skinny,
white dude,

32:10.036 --> 32:11.869
he used to throw around
his money and coke.

32:11.871 --> 32:13.237
Roland.

32:13.239 --> 32:15.939
Yeah, yeah, Roland.
Roland Hunt, asshole.

32:15.941 --> 32:17.208
- Nobody liked him.
- No.

32:17.210 --> 32:18.411
Yeah.

32:19.912 --> 32:21.580
What? No.

32:22.949 --> 32:24.648
Terry.

32:24.650 --> 32:26.049
Come on.

32:26.051 --> 32:27.218
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait, wait, wait.

32:27.220 --> 32:28.421
Look at him.

32:31.057 --> 32:33.757
He actually looks like Roland.

32:33.759 --> 32:35.592
No, I don't.

32:35.594 --> 32:38.698
You know, you do.
You do, Pete.

32:40.199 --> 32:42.100
The, uh, eyes?

32:42.102 --> 32:43.167
The nose?

32:43.169 --> 32:44.302
The peanut head.

32:44.304 --> 32:45.902
The long, skinny neck.

32:45.904 --> 32:47.071
<i>The mouth?</i>

32:47.073 --> 32:48.738
<i>Yeah. The mouth.</i>

32:48.740 --> 32:50.106
No, he's right.

32:50.108 --> 32:52.442
You just said Roland was an
asshole, nobody liked him.

32:52.444 --> 32:54.077
Why would Mom sleep with him?

32:54.079 --> 32:56.346
Charity fuck? I don't know.

32:56.348 --> 32:58.949
No, no.
We already figured this out.

32:58.951 --> 33:00.417
Terry is our dad.

33:00.419 --> 33:02.489
You're our dad, right?

33:08.562 --> 33:10.460
Uh... No.

33:10.462 --> 33:11.562
Gosh, fellas.

33:11.564 --> 33:12.830
I don't know what to say.

33:12.832 --> 33:15.298
I'm so sorry
I'm not your dad. Really.

33:15.300 --> 33:16.601
- That's all right.
- Yeah.

33:16.603 --> 33:18.902
- It's not your fault.
- Donald. Thanks.

33:18.904 --> 33:20.103
It's still Kyle.

33:20.105 --> 33:21.972
Was that fun, throwing
the ball on the beach?

33:21.974 --> 33:23.039
So fun.

33:23.041 --> 33:24.106
You guys are good, good hands.

33:24.108 --> 33:25.543
I thought it was a blast.

33:25.545 --> 33:27.911
I love you, Terry.

33:27.913 --> 33:29.647
Yeah. Okay.

33:29.649 --> 33:31.081
<i>We'll see you
down the road.</i>

33:31.083 --> 33:33.317
All right, man. All right.
Y'all be good, hear?

33:33.319 --> 33:34.818
You take care, Mr. Bradshaw.

33:34.820 --> 33:35.952
I will.

33:35.954 --> 33:38.022
Hey, tell your mom I said hi.
All right?

33:38.024 --> 33:39.489
Yeah.

33:39.491 --> 33:41.694
All right. See you guys!

33:52.837 --> 33:55.939
Hey, maybe you'll get along
even better with Roland.

33:55.941 --> 33:59.376
Aren't you bummed out
Terry Bradshaw's not our dad?

33:59.378 --> 34:01.277
How fucking cool
would that be?

34:01.279 --> 34:02.513
<i>Listen,</i>

34:02.515 --> 34:05.615
the universe
is saying look 'em up.

34:05.617 --> 34:08.052
And the universe has
a tendency to point you

34:08.054 --> 34:10.489
in the right direction
if you listen to it.

34:18.831 --> 34:20.897
<i>I found a Roland Hunt,</i>

34:20.899 --> 34:24.768
<i>investment banker,
in Beacon, New York.</i>

34:24.770 --> 34:26.370
<i>Two hours north of Manhattan.</i>

34:26.371 --> 34:29.408
<i>All right, looks like
we're going to New York.</i>

35:05.076 --> 35:06.310
Make it quick!

35:06.312 --> 35:08.212
I'm pulling out in 30 seconds.

35:08.214 --> 35:09.812
Time me.

35:09.814 --> 35:12.315
I want to get to Roland's
office by noon.

35:12.317 --> 35:15.421
Twelve. 13. 14.

35:22.428 --> 35:23.694
Alex, stop it.

35:23.696 --> 35:25.830
Stop it, Alex.
Get back here right now.

35:25.832 --> 35:27.631
No! It stinks!

35:29.134 --> 35:31.000
You got a jail break there.

35:31.002 --> 35:32.136
<i>Sorry, man.</i>

35:32.138 --> 35:33.471
I'd come out if I could.

35:33.473 --> 35:35.239
Just let me know
if he's bothering you.

35:35.241 --> 35:36.540
He's doing good.

35:36.542 --> 35:38.241
I actually got
a bun in the oven, too.

35:39.511 --> 35:41.511
Whoa. I got a call.
Alex, excuse me.

35:41.513 --> 35:42.747
Kapono, talk to me.

35:45.317 --> 35:47.754
What? No, no,
you're breaking up.

35:49.788 --> 35:52.355
They're going another way?

35:52.357 --> 35:54.324
What does that mean?

35:56.729 --> 35:59.129
Hey! Whoa, whoa! Hey! Whoa!

35:59.131 --> 36:00.397
I've got flip-flops on!

36:00.399 --> 36:01.464
Is he peeing on you?

36:01.466 --> 36:02.734
Yeah, has he done this before?

36:02.736 --> 36:04.368
Unfortunately, yes.
It's a real problem.

36:04.370 --> 36:05.736
Sir, this is crazy,

36:05.738 --> 36:06.937
but you're going to
have to pee on my kid.

36:06.939 --> 36:08.004
You want me
to pee on your kid?

36:08.006 --> 36:09.073
Please, dad to dad.

36:09.075 --> 36:10.140
<i>He needs to
learn consequences.</i>

36:10.142 --> 36:11.574
I'm not going to...

36:11.576 --> 36:14.078
Do you hear that, Alex?
Is that what you want?

36:14.080 --> 36:15.482
Stop!

36:16.047 --> 36:17.417
<i>There! Yeah.</i>

36:18.317 --> 36:19.519
Chaos theory.

36:21.153 --> 36:22.886
He started it.

36:22.888 --> 36:25.858
<i>I swear. This is justified.</i>

36:29.796 --> 36:31.598
Hey. That kid had it coming.

36:46.145 --> 36:47.781
How much did Ethan cost?

36:48.781 --> 36:50.614
Well, we didn't buy him.

36:50.616 --> 36:52.885
To raise him. I know
you guys didn't buy him.

36:53.620 --> 36:55.919
Um, well...

36:55.921 --> 36:57.288
Four more years
of private school,

36:57.290 --> 37:01.692
four years of college,
tutors, summer camp.

37:01.694 --> 37:05.096
Every single Apple product
that ever comes out.

37:05.098 --> 37:08.399
Uh, once all said and done,
we're probably pushing a mil.

37:08.401 --> 37:11.268
A million dollars?

37:11.270 --> 37:12.703
To raise a kid?

37:12.705 --> 37:14.808
What do you care?
You're loaded.

37:15.207 --> 37:16.739
Besides,

37:16.741 --> 37:20.344
"Money's never wasted
on the ones you love." Right?

37:20.346 --> 37:26.049
No, I know. I was just worried
about you and Ethan.

37:26.051 --> 37:29.185
<i>Good thing Roland's
a financial wizard, right?</i>

37:29.187 --> 37:30.920
<i>I thought
we were going to his office.</i>

37:30.922 --> 37:32.589
<i>This is all residential.</i>

37:32.591 --> 37:34.058
<i>Maybe
he works from home.</i>

37:34.060 --> 37:36.696
<i>Destination is on your right.</i>

38:00.653 --> 38:01.984
Why are you copying me?

38:01.986 --> 38:03.286
- I just did that.
- I'm not copying you.

38:03.288 --> 38:04.487
I did all of those things.

38:04.489 --> 38:06.526
You weren't
touching this thing.

38:07.192 --> 38:09.125
This is cold.

38:09.127 --> 38:11.062
<i>So?</i>

38:11.064 --> 38:14.533
I don't think anyone's
been here for hours.

38:15.801 --> 38:17.201
Door knob tell you that?

38:17.203 --> 38:18.368
These are painted shut.

38:18.370 --> 38:20.737
So, what?
Kyle, where are you going?

38:20.739 --> 38:22.538
Come on! Kyle.

38:22.540 --> 38:23.808
This is locked.

38:23.810 --> 38:25.676
Of course it's locked.
He's not home.

38:25.678 --> 38:27.310
Come on. What are you doing?

38:27.312 --> 38:28.544
You hear those vibrations?

38:28.546 --> 38:29.747
You're hearing vibrations?

38:29.749 --> 38:31.283
'Cause I'm getting
a weird vibe.

38:33.486 --> 38:35.986
Oh. Oh, God.

38:35.988 --> 38:38.656
Looks like you picked the
wrong house, motherfuckers.

38:38.658 --> 38:39.924
Pete, don't do anything funny.

38:39.926 --> 38:41.324
Why would you
put that in his head?

38:41.326 --> 38:42.460
<i>No karate.</i>

38:42.462 --> 38:44.161
Fucking no karate.

38:44.163 --> 38:46.029
I haven't done karate
in 30 years.

38:46.031 --> 38:47.730
He's got a gun.
And that beats karate.

38:47.732 --> 38:49.001
Shut the fuck up.

38:51.404 --> 38:54.805
What the fuck kind of B & E
guys are you two assholes?

38:54.807 --> 38:56.440
We're not robbers.

38:56.442 --> 38:58.975
We're just looking for a guy
named Roland Hunt. That's it.

38:58.977 --> 39:00.444
What do you want with him?

39:00.446 --> 39:03.580
He dated our mom,
Helen Baxter, in the '70s.

39:03.582 --> 39:06.183
Oh, shit!

39:06.185 --> 39:10.187
You guys are
Lenny Baxter's kids?

39:10.189 --> 39:11.555
You called her Lenny?

39:11.557 --> 39:13.591
You're Roland Hunt?

39:13.593 --> 39:17.393
I can't believe I almost shot
one of Lenny Baxter's kids!

39:17.395 --> 39:18.562
That is hilarious.

39:18.564 --> 39:19.995
And gave this one
a heart attack.

39:19.997 --> 39:21.899
Yeah.
Almost took you both out.

39:21.901 --> 39:24.768
Two for one.

39:24.770 --> 39:25.969
I mean, I guess
you probably don't think

39:25.971 --> 39:27.170
it's that funny, but...

39:27.172 --> 39:29.406
Oh, fuck, yeah,
I'm sorry about the gun.

39:29.408 --> 39:30.607
Listen, I only got this

39:30.609 --> 39:31.975
because we got
a lot of break-ins

39:31.977 --> 39:33.777
in the neighborhood.
Got it for protection.

39:33.779 --> 39:35.245
Better safe than sorry.

39:35.247 --> 39:37.147
Honestly, I don't even like
holding the thing.

39:37.149 --> 39:38.281
Here, you take it.

39:38.283 --> 39:40.951
- No, no, no.
- Come on in the house, boys.

39:40.953 --> 39:42.852
I thought
you were gonna flip him.

39:42.854 --> 39:44.856
You're dangerous.

39:46.892 --> 39:49.328
Mom! We got company!

39:50.062 --> 39:51.598
Mom!

39:52.966 --> 39:54.797
<i>Mom!</i>

39:54.799 --> 39:56.332
Could that be Grandma?

39:56.334 --> 39:57.468
Hello!

39:57.470 --> 39:58.669
Hi!

39:58.671 --> 40:00.603
Roland!
They got a fucking gun!

40:00.605 --> 40:02.940
- No.
- Don't hold it like that.

40:02.942 --> 40:04.241
Drop the fucking gun,
motherfucker.

40:04.243 --> 40:06.442
Fuck! It's just the gun
you handed me,

40:06.444 --> 40:07.844
like, a minute ago.

40:07.846 --> 40:10.247
Oh, right. Yes. God damn it.
So sorry. Shit!

40:10.249 --> 40:12.582
I don't know
what's going on with me.

40:12.584 --> 40:13.649
It's tense with
all the break-ins

40:13.651 --> 40:14.718
in the neighborhood.

40:14.720 --> 40:16.419
I'm really sorry.

40:16.421 --> 40:17.721
Putting this down.

40:17.723 --> 40:19.056
You should've seen
your faces, though.

40:19.058 --> 40:20.857
You looked like
you shit yourselves.

40:20.859 --> 40:22.859
They looked scared as shit.

40:22.861 --> 40:24.794
Right?

40:24.796 --> 40:26.230
Come on and say hi to Mom.

40:26.232 --> 40:28.464
You're holding it in
such a threatening way.

40:28.466 --> 40:29.799
You can't do that.

40:29.801 --> 40:31.301
Hey, Mom, it's okay.

40:31.303 --> 40:33.370
These are Lenny Baxter's kids.
You remember Lenny?

40:33.372 --> 40:34.374
Oh, Lenny.

40:35.140 --> 40:36.906
What a sweet man!

40:36.908 --> 40:39.310
So, what are you doing here?

40:39.312 --> 40:41.277
Is everything okay
with your mom?

40:41.279 --> 40:43.080
Everything's good.
We're on a quest.

40:43.082 --> 40:45.716
And I'll just
cut right to the chase.

40:45.718 --> 40:48.051
Did you know Lenny

40:48.053 --> 40:51.821
between April and May of 1975?

40:51.823 --> 40:53.757
Know her, like,
in a biblical sense.

40:53.759 --> 40:54.824
Sorry.

40:54.826 --> 40:56.326
No, she's heard it all.

40:56.328 --> 40:57.861
Okay.

40:57.863 --> 41:00.397
Yeah. '75, that sounds
about right. Yeah.

41:00.399 --> 41:02.000
Why do you ask?

41:05.002 --> 41:07.039
We think we're your sons.

41:08.272 --> 41:09.873
Your boys.

41:09.875 --> 41:11.640
Me and Pete.

41:11.642 --> 41:13.378
You're our dad.

41:22.187 --> 41:23.189
Hi.

41:51.984 --> 41:55.922
Will you just excuse me
for a minute?

42:02.395 --> 42:03.692
That was one of
the most powerful things

42:03.694 --> 42:04.794
I've ever seen.

42:04.796 --> 42:07.364
He just inhaled us.

42:07.366 --> 42:08.431
Yeah.

42:08.433 --> 42:09.699
Did you smell him?

42:09.701 --> 42:11.000
- You smelled him?
- Yes!

42:11.002 --> 42:12.301
What did he smell like?

42:12.303 --> 42:14.437
He smelled like

42:14.439 --> 42:15.672
- home.
- Home?

42:15.674 --> 42:17.741
<i>Fuck this! No!</i>

42:17.743 --> 42:19.042
<i>There is no fucking way</i>

42:19.044 --> 42:21.078
<i>those two jackasses
are my kids!</i>

42:21.080 --> 42:22.812
<i>They don't even
fucking look like me!</i>

42:22.814 --> 42:24.047
<i>The one with the beard</i>

42:24.049 --> 42:25.582
<i>has your beautiful eyes.</i>

42:25.584 --> 42:26.850
<i>Big fucking deal.</i>

42:26.852 --> 42:28.185
<i>Fuck 'em! They look like</i>

42:28.187 --> 42:29.453
<i>a couple of total
fucking dickheads!</i>

42:29.455 --> 42:33.390
Oh... We are not
descended from that.

42:33.392 --> 42:34.861
That's not our dad.

42:38.363 --> 42:41.065
Would you boys like
anything to drink?

42:41.067 --> 42:43.899
I would love a Hinano beer.

42:43.901 --> 42:45.868
I'll see if we have one.

42:45.870 --> 42:47.370
It's an awesome Tahitian beer.

42:47.372 --> 42:49.306
She is so adorable.

42:49.308 --> 42:50.473
I'm out of here.

42:50.475 --> 42:52.475
If he is our father,
I don't want to know.

42:52.477 --> 42:53.877
Come on, Pete.

42:53.879 --> 42:57.614
He's in shock, all right?
I'm getting good energy here.

42:57.616 --> 42:59.049
Based on what?

42:59.051 --> 43:02.618
We are all out of Mojumbo.

43:02.620 --> 43:04.120
But

43:04.122 --> 43:08.226
Roland has something
that he'd like to say to you.

43:09.127 --> 43:10.627
I'm sorry.

43:10.629 --> 43:13.098
<i>I don't think they heard you.</i>

43:14.433 --> 43:17.968
I'm sorry!

43:17.970 --> 43:19.368
Well, three time's the charm.

43:19.370 --> 43:22.906
Oh, this is just
such a blessing.

43:22.908 --> 43:25.243
I'm finally a grandma.

43:26.278 --> 43:28.413
Well, I'm gonna go finish up.

43:31.116 --> 43:33.052
Well, listen.
It's a pleasure. Really.

43:34.587 --> 43:37.323
Something I want to show
you guys. Come here.

43:38.057 --> 43:39.589
<i>Go ahead, guys.</i>

43:39.591 --> 43:41.093
<i>After you.</i>

43:42.026 --> 43:44.094
Are you happy?

43:44.096 --> 43:45.661
He's gonna kill us down here.

43:45.663 --> 43:46.897
He's not going to kill us.

43:46.899 --> 43:48.732
Yes, he is.

43:48.734 --> 43:50.667
Is there a light down here?

43:50.669 --> 43:51.935
<i>No, that bulb's out.</i>

43:51.937 --> 43:53.636
<i>You can use
your phone, I guess.</i>

43:53.638 --> 43:54.872
Did you bring the gun?

43:54.874 --> 43:56.406
No,
I did not bring the gun.

43:56.408 --> 43:58.140
- Damn it.
- I left it upstairs.

43:58.142 --> 43:59.576
<i>Take a left
at the bottom of the stairs.</i>

43:59.578 --> 44:01.109
Oh, my God.

44:01.111 --> 44:02.612
Why are there mannequins?

44:02.614 --> 44:04.317
Pete, I'm scared.

44:06.051 --> 44:08.484
How are
the vibes now, Kyle?

44:08.486 --> 44:09.588
Not good.

44:11.924 --> 44:13.390
There we go.

44:13.392 --> 44:14.426
<i>Now...</i>

44:15.928 --> 44:18.194
I think this is it.

44:18.196 --> 44:19.966
Pete, you want to
do the honors?

44:26.171 --> 44:27.373
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

44:29.508 --> 44:32.375
That is the wrong box.

44:32.377 --> 44:33.379
Sorry.

44:33.812 --> 44:35.013
Uh...

44:35.714 --> 44:37.616
Gotta be this one.

44:39.017 --> 44:40.616
Okay.

44:40.618 --> 44:42.886
I'll do it for you.

44:42.888 --> 44:44.422
No rodents.

44:45.524 --> 44:46.525
Go ahead.

44:49.395 --> 44:50.596
Is that Mom?

44:51.029 --> 44:52.297
What?

44:53.466 --> 44:54.698
Oh, my God.

44:54.700 --> 44:56.600
Look at you guys.

44:56.602 --> 44:58.734
You look incredible.

44:58.736 --> 45:00.469
Yeah, she looks really happy.

45:00.471 --> 45:02.374
She was

45:03.073 --> 45:05.278
just an amazing woman.

45:05.877 --> 45:07.678
Okay.

45:07.680 --> 45:11.848
You don't have to tell us
what an amazing lay she was,

45:11.850 --> 45:13.283
and how suckable

45:13.285 --> 45:15.719
her candied nipples are...

45:15.721 --> 45:17.120
What the hell is the matter...

45:17.122 --> 45:19.256
This is your mom
we're talking about. Jesus.

45:19.258 --> 45:21.457
Pete! That's not appropriate!

45:21.459 --> 45:22.593
Sorry, Roland.

45:22.595 --> 45:24.227
<i>Whatever, anyway.</i>

45:24.229 --> 45:27.096
My point being,

45:27.098 --> 45:30.169
she's the only woman
I ever truly loved.

45:31.435 --> 45:33.136
Oh, man.

45:33.138 --> 45:35.904
I think that's why I got
a little kind of

45:35.906 --> 45:37.674
bent out of shape
upstairs there

45:37.676 --> 45:40.377
when you guys dropped
the bombshell on me,

45:40.379 --> 45:44.047
and, honestly,
I was just kind of

45:44.049 --> 45:46.986
regretting
what might have been.

45:47.653 --> 45:49.152
Hmm.

45:49.154 --> 45:51.989
I mean, I'm not
exactly living the dream here.

45:51.991 --> 45:53.459
Sometimes, um...

45:56.028 --> 45:58.328
You just...

45:58.330 --> 46:00.295
Sometimes
you just find yourself

46:00.297 --> 46:03.035
not where you want to be.

46:05.671 --> 46:06.937
Yeah. I'm sorry.

46:06.939 --> 46:08.540
Thanks, Pete.

46:11.310 --> 46:13.542
Well, I got a work thing,
guys. I gotta go. Sorry.

46:13.544 --> 46:16.379
What, you got like a little
Wall Street deal going on?

46:16.381 --> 46:18.047
<i>No. I'll tell you
what I've learned.</i>

46:18.049 --> 46:20.350
You've got to diversify.

46:20.352 --> 46:21.917
And I don't care
if you're making

46:21.919 --> 46:23.319
10 grand a year or 10 million.

46:23.321 --> 46:25.221
You don't want it
all coming from one place.

46:25.223 --> 46:26.922
That's how guys get burned.

46:26.924 --> 46:28.524
Really?

46:28.526 --> 46:30.729
Oh, yeah. Don't want
all your eggs in one basket.

46:32.596 --> 46:33.765
Come on.

46:35.968 --> 46:37.134
<i>Lately,
I've been doing</i>

46:37.136 --> 46:38.435
a lot of work with creditors.

46:38.437 --> 46:41.337
Helping them to
reacquire merchandise

46:41.339 --> 46:44.373
when the debtor can no longer
afford the payments.

46:44.375 --> 46:45.975
Oh, like a repo man.

46:45.977 --> 46:47.111
Yeah, exactly.

46:47.113 --> 46:48.344
Of course now, I gotta call

46:48.346 --> 46:49.612
a fucking cab
just to do this job.

46:49.614 --> 46:51.814
We can
give you a ride, right?

46:51.816 --> 46:53.783
Oh, no, I couldn't
impose on you guys.

46:53.785 --> 46:55.118
Oh, come on.

46:55.120 --> 46:57.087
Besides, it can be dangerous,
repo work.

46:57.089 --> 46:58.321
You know, people don't like

46:58.323 --> 46:59.957
having their stuff
taken from them.

46:59.959 --> 47:01.790
Hey, people don't like having
their anuses probed either,

47:01.792 --> 47:05.330
but that's how I've made
a living the last 12 years.

47:06.698 --> 47:08.832
As a doctor.

47:08.834 --> 47:09.931
Oh.

47:09.933 --> 47:13.171
Come on. Let us help you.

47:13.872 --> 47:16.138
So, what happens

47:16.140 --> 47:18.741
if they show up
while you're doing this?

47:18.743 --> 47:20.042
Well...

47:20.044 --> 47:22.846
Hope for the best, prepare
for the worst, you know?

47:22.848 --> 47:24.346
If he does show up,

47:24.348 --> 47:27.049
you can expect to hear
some top-shelf bullshit.

47:27.051 --> 47:28.518
Is that right?

47:28.520 --> 47:31.154
"Repossessed? I've never even
missed a payment!

47:31.156 --> 47:33.422
"Got to be a computer error."

47:33.424 --> 47:35.424
That is classic bullshit.

47:35.426 --> 47:38.127
<i>They're late
on their child support,</i>

47:38.129 --> 47:39.930
they'll even deny
they have kids.

47:39.932 --> 47:41.029
<i>What?</i>

47:41.031 --> 47:43.634
God! Just sick.

47:45.504 --> 47:48.136
Got to love that sound,
huh, Pete?

47:48.138 --> 47:49.439
- There you go.
- Oh, wow!

47:49.441 --> 47:50.873
Plus, there's only
going to be room for

47:50.875 --> 47:52.107
<i>- two of us, so who draws...
- Shotgun!</i>

47:52.109 --> 47:53.442
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck.

47:53.444 --> 47:55.044
<i>No, no. No worries.</i>

47:55.046 --> 47:57.212
We're within
our legal rights here.

47:57.214 --> 47:59.815
Just doing our jobs.

47:59.817 --> 48:01.384
What the fuck you doing
to my property?

48:01.386 --> 48:02.585
Your car's being repossessed.

48:02.587 --> 48:04.420
I'd advise you
to just stand back

48:04.422 --> 48:05.622
and let us do our jobs.

48:05.624 --> 48:07.524
You're going to
repossess my car?

48:07.526 --> 48:10.460
I've never missed
a single payment.

48:10.462 --> 48:12.027
Guys, this has got to be
some kind of computer error.

48:12.029 --> 48:13.997
Check your little computer
things, and you'll find out.

48:13.999 --> 48:15.263
Two for two.

48:15.265 --> 48:17.134
<i>My God!</i>

48:17.136 --> 48:18.902
Word on the street is
you even missed

48:18.904 --> 48:20.270
your child support payments.

48:20.272 --> 48:21.504
Come on, man.

48:21.506 --> 48:23.138
Hey, genius,
I don't have any kids.

48:23.140 --> 48:25.140
I'm sorry. Paying your bills,

48:25.142 --> 48:27.176
very basic adult
responsibility.

48:27.178 --> 48:29.279
- Yup. Well said, Pete.
- Thank you.

48:29.281 --> 48:31.047
This is insanity.
I'm calling the police.

48:31.049 --> 48:32.415
Well, feel free,

48:32.417 --> 48:33.449
but it is going to be
pretty embarrassing

48:33.451 --> 48:35.752
when I show them
the paperwork.

48:35.754 --> 48:37.219
I left it in the car.

48:37.221 --> 48:38.422
Kyle, can I have the keys?

48:38.424 --> 48:39.788
<i>And I'll run down there
and get it.</i>

48:39.790 --> 48:40.890
<i>Give him the keys.</i>

48:40.892 --> 48:42.391
Thank you.

48:42.393 --> 48:45.027
And make sure they don't
escape in the old Ferrari.

48:45.029 --> 48:46.294
Make sure I don't
steal my own car.

48:46.296 --> 48:47.663
We got this. We got this.

48:47.665 --> 48:48.998
- Yeah, Pete's got this.
- Deadbeat asshole.

48:49.000 --> 48:50.667
Are you fucking kidding me?

48:50.669 --> 48:53.870
Let me tell you something,
McEnroe,

48:53.872 --> 48:55.705
you're not too big to fail.

48:55.707 --> 48:57.073
That's right.

48:57.075 --> 48:58.475
You failed today.

48:58.477 --> 49:01.243
Because we're taking
your Ferrari.

49:01.245 --> 49:03.881
<i>You just double faulted.</i>

49:03.883 --> 49:07.384
<i>And the bank broke your serve.</i>

49:07.386 --> 49:08.685
- You know what, buddy?
- What?

49:08.687 --> 49:12.288
Life isn't about
just accumulating stuff.

49:12.290 --> 49:13.924
All right?

49:13.926 --> 49:17.160
The fast cars
and the big house in Hawaii

49:17.162 --> 49:18.460
<i>and the white clothes</i>

49:18.462 --> 49:19.596
and the model girlfriend.

49:19.598 --> 49:21.131
This is freaking New York!

49:21.133 --> 49:23.131
This is my wife. Hello.

49:23.133 --> 49:24.699
You think I'm a model?

49:24.701 --> 49:27.404
Well, he doesn't think you're
a model, you're 5'2".

49:27.406 --> 49:28.638
Yeah, she's got
a wedding ring.

49:28.640 --> 49:30.473
I didn't see the wedding ring.

49:30.475 --> 49:32.442
Oh, my God. You know what?

49:32.444 --> 49:35.044
This ain't worth it.
Fine, you guys are right.

49:35.046 --> 49:36.111
I'll just cut you a check.

49:36.113 --> 49:37.881
Could we just
end this, please?

49:37.883 --> 49:39.649
Do me a favor,
go get the check book.

49:39.651 --> 49:41.250
It's in the closet.
My side of the bed, please?

49:41.252 --> 49:42.453
- Okay.
- Thank you.

49:43.022 --> 49:44.620
All good.

49:44.622 --> 49:46.055
<i>Yeah, it's me.
That Ferrari didn't work out.</i>

49:46.057 --> 49:49.859
You know anybody who can move
a Chevy Malibu?

49:49.861 --> 49:51.497
All right, call me back.

49:56.200 --> 49:58.336
You gotta be kidding me.

50:04.209 --> 50:05.844
Damn it, Lenny.

50:06.877 --> 50:08.879
Where's Roland?

50:08.881 --> 50:09.812
He's coming.

50:09.814 --> 50:11.147
<i>- Honey!
- Yeah?</i>

50:11.149 --> 50:12.348
I've got the check book.

50:12.350 --> 50:13.752
Great.

50:15.053 --> 50:16.352
Come on, let's go!

50:16.354 --> 50:17.553
Give me the gun.
Don't point it at me!

50:17.555 --> 50:18.855
- We're taking the Ferrari!
- Pete!

50:18.857 --> 50:19.989
Do it for Dad!

50:19.991 --> 50:21.089
Come on!

50:21.091 --> 50:22.991
Babe, give me the gun!

50:22.993 --> 50:24.729
- Shit!
- Go, go, go!

50:25.497 --> 50:27.297
Let go of the fucking gun!

50:27.299 --> 50:28.667
Stop!

50:31.102 --> 50:32.268
Roland, we got it!

50:32.270 --> 50:34.837
We got the car!

50:36.008 --> 50:37.009
Stop!

50:38.977 --> 50:40.310
Oh, shit.

50:40.312 --> 50:41.377
God!

50:41.379 --> 50:42.477
What was that?

50:42.479 --> 50:44.482
I think it was a person.

50:45.350 --> 50:46.482
Roland!

50:46.484 --> 50:47.951
Oh, my God, you killed Dad!

50:47.953 --> 50:49.185
- Roland!
- Dad!

50:49.187 --> 50:50.689
Dial 911!

50:54.125 --> 50:56.026
So, I guess Dad's a bad guy.

50:56.028 --> 50:57.495
Oh, yeah.

50:59.430 --> 51:02.065
I understand
how Luke Skywalker felt now.

51:02.067 --> 51:04.533
Yeah, seriously.

51:04.535 --> 51:06.738
She's really beautiful.

51:07.738 --> 51:10.239
<i>She looks great here.</i>

51:10.241 --> 51:11.507
Glowing.

51:11.509 --> 51:13.944
Roland even looks good.
Who's this?

51:13.946 --> 51:17.449
Who's this guy
with the scratched out face?

51:20.218 --> 51:21.817
Excuse me, Doc.

51:21.819 --> 51:24.053
Doc, any word?

51:24.055 --> 51:27.290
Well, the good news is that
he's in stable condition.

51:27.292 --> 51:28.457
- Great!
- Okay. All right.

51:28.459 --> 51:29.725
The bad news, however,

51:29.727 --> 51:31.727
is that his blood
is AB positive.

51:31.729 --> 51:33.161
What? That doesn't sound...

51:33.163 --> 51:34.364
No, no, it's just that

51:34.366 --> 51:36.533
the blood you gave
is O negative.

51:36.535 --> 51:39.902
Negative? Mine is?

51:39.904 --> 51:42.404
It means that, uh,

51:42.406 --> 51:44.473
he can't be our father.

51:44.475 --> 51:46.241
Genetically.

51:46.243 --> 51:49.347
<i>You can go in
and see him if you like.</i>

51:50.180 --> 51:51.482
Thank you.

51:55.788 --> 51:59.587
You're awake.
How you doing there, champ?

51:59.589 --> 52:01.457
Mmm, feeling no pain.

52:01.459 --> 52:02.660
Yeah.

52:03.428 --> 52:05.462
Sorry we ran over you.

52:05.464 --> 52:07.998
And sorry
you're going to jail.

52:08.000 --> 52:09.966
Be good to get off
the hamster wheel.

52:09.968 --> 52:11.067
I hear ya.

52:11.069 --> 52:12.829
Hey, Roland,
let me ask you something.

52:14.171 --> 52:16.538
When did you know

52:16.540 --> 52:17.875
that we weren't yours?

52:18.944 --> 52:20.143
I don't know,

52:20.145 --> 52:22.178
like, two minutes ago
when the doc told me.

52:22.180 --> 52:23.513
Unbelievable.

52:23.515 --> 52:24.714
So, as far as you knew,

52:24.716 --> 52:26.982
you were intentionally duping

52:26.984 --> 52:30.053
your own sons into
committing a felony?

52:30.055 --> 52:31.388
Yeah. So? Whatever.

52:31.390 --> 52:33.790
Don't be such
a fucking pussy about it.

52:33.792 --> 52:37.625
My dad was an asshole, too.
He ran out, he was a crook.

52:37.627 --> 52:39.294
Life sucks. Life is hard.

52:39.296 --> 52:40.430
<i>Get over it.</i>

52:40.432 --> 52:43.332
Life is hard, Pete.

52:43.334 --> 52:46.268
<i>Wait a minute. You know what?</i>

52:46.270 --> 52:50.038
Fuck! I should've known
you guys weren't mine.

52:50.040 --> 52:51.341
'75 you said, right?

52:51.343 --> 52:52.908
<i>Spring of '75?</i>

52:52.910 --> 52:54.210
Right.

52:54.212 --> 52:56.712
I started dating Lenny in '74.

52:56.714 --> 52:58.214
By the spring of '75,

52:58.216 --> 53:00.951
I was doing
my first stint in the joint.

53:00.953 --> 53:03.152
I got busted dealing coke
in this nightclub

53:03.154 --> 53:05.555
by some fucking disco-permed,

53:05.557 --> 53:07.556
roller-skating,
motherfucking narc.

53:07.558 --> 53:08.761
<i>Wait.</i>

53:10.729 --> 53:11.960
You mean this guy.

53:11.962 --> 53:13.763
<i>Yeah. That's the guy.</i>

53:13.765 --> 53:15.832
I don't know what pissed me
off more, he put me in jail

53:15.834 --> 53:17.799
or he started
schtupping your mom

53:17.801 --> 53:19.569
the second I was behind bars.

53:19.571 --> 53:22.071
This guy was schtupping
our mother?

53:22.073 --> 53:23.776
Hey.

53:24.642 --> 53:27.377
That guy is your fucking dad.

53:27.379 --> 53:30.446
I should've known. You look
like a couple of junior narcs.

53:30.448 --> 53:32.681
Well, do you have a name?

53:32.683 --> 53:34.384
Give me 1,000 bucks
and I'll tell you.

53:34.386 --> 53:36.152
- Fuck you! Come on, Kyle.
- Pete...

53:36.154 --> 53:37.987
Okay, nice meeting you.

53:37.989 --> 53:39.124
Roland...

53:43.328 --> 53:45.761
Would you take $400?

53:45.763 --> 53:47.696
- Sparkly P?
- Yup.

53:47.698 --> 53:52.701
You just paid Roland
$1,000 for the name Sparkly P!

53:52.703 --> 53:54.303
You got conned, Kyle!

53:54.305 --> 53:57.073
I paid him $680
and I had $1,000.

53:57.075 --> 53:59.408
I conned him. Yeah!

53:59.410 --> 54:01.944
And now I think we're ready
to make a little inquiry

54:01.946 --> 54:04.214
into this Sparkly P character.

54:04.216 --> 54:06.716
Yeah? Where? The white pages?

54:06.718 --> 54:08.819
Huh? The glitter store?

54:08.821 --> 54:11.587
Do you realize
how insane you sound?

54:11.589 --> 54:13.690
We're going home!

54:13.692 --> 54:15.223
<i>You're just
gonna give up?</i>

54:15.225 --> 54:16.859
We almost got killed!

54:16.861 --> 54:19.828
We? Roland almost got killed.
What are you talking about?

54:19.830 --> 54:22.031
We just had one of the best
adventures of our lives.

54:22.033 --> 54:23.165
No, we didn't.

54:23.167 --> 54:24.334
What happened to

54:24.336 --> 54:26.636
Mr. "I won't rest
until we find our dad"?

54:26.638 --> 54:28.837
The universe
doesn't like quitters, Pete.

54:28.839 --> 54:31.339
You know what?
Fuck the universe!

54:31.341 --> 54:33.009
The universe sucks!

54:33.011 --> 54:34.444
Don't say that.

54:34.446 --> 54:36.645
You realize this whole time
it's been telling us it's time

54:36.647 --> 54:39.448
to shut down Operation
Who's Your Daddy?

54:39.450 --> 54:41.151
That's a good name
for it, Pete.

54:41.153 --> 54:44.987
That's a good name
for the quest.

54:44.989 --> 54:48.890
But before we close the book
on Operation Who's Your Daddy,

54:48.892 --> 54:50.192
let me say one thing, Pete...

54:50.194 --> 54:53.263
It's too late.
Kyle, book is closed.

54:53.265 --> 54:54.497
- That's it?
- Yup. That's it.

54:54.499 --> 54:56.366
- <i>You don't want to hear it?</i>
- No!

54:56.368 --> 54:59.301
I got us on the 10:00 p.m.
flight out of JFK.

54:59.303 --> 55:00.772
That is what we're doing.

55:01.939 --> 55:03.172
Look at this poor guy.

55:03.174 --> 55:05.573
No one will even give him
the time of day.

55:05.575 --> 55:06.808
Well, we're not stopping.

55:06.810 --> 55:07.944
We're not picking up
a hitchhiker.

55:07.946 --> 55:09.946
What do you think
is gonna happen?

55:09.948 --> 55:13.549
You think he's gonna just
murder you, rob you, rape you?

55:13.551 --> 55:14.884
Yeah. All three.

55:14.886 --> 55:17.152
Okay, all of the above.
Look at him.

55:17.154 --> 55:18.922
I am looking at him.

55:18.924 --> 55:21.024
<i>You know somebody
your whole life,</i>

55:21.026 --> 55:22.959
and then you wake up
and you realize

55:22.961 --> 55:25.060
you've been
lying next to a racist.

55:25.062 --> 55:26.895
What?
It's not 'cause he's black.

55:26.897 --> 55:28.464
It's 'cause he's a stranger

55:28.466 --> 55:29.899
and a hitchhiker

55:29.901 --> 55:32.335
and could very easily
be a serial killer.

55:32.337 --> 55:36.038
There are
no black serial killers, Pete.

55:36.040 --> 55:37.207
<i>That's a fact.</i>

55:37.209 --> 55:38.841
<i>Just don't make
eye contact, please?</i>

55:38.843 --> 55:40.743
Because then
I'll have to pull over,

55:40.745 --> 55:42.312
and it'll be awkward

55:42.314 --> 55:44.647
and we'll have to give him
a ride and all that. Just...

55:44.649 --> 55:47.149
You're looking
in his direction.

55:47.151 --> 55:48.317
I'm not looking.

55:48.319 --> 55:49.919
<i>You're totally
turning your head.</i>

55:49.921 --> 55:51.553
- My eyes are wandering.
<i>- I'm watching you.</i>

55:51.555 --> 55:53.055
Look this way.

55:53.057 --> 55:54.790
- Pete, I'm not looking.
- Look out the left.

55:54.792 --> 55:55.924
You're totally
looking right at him.

55:55.926 --> 55:57.194
<i>My peripheral vision.</i>

55:58.229 --> 56:00.297
Oh, God damn it!

56:00.299 --> 56:01.763
What? I didn't look at him!

56:01.765 --> 56:04.001
- Ah, he got me.
<i>- What?</i>

56:05.236 --> 56:07.902
I blew it.
That one's on me.

56:07.904 --> 56:09.372
- You made eye contact?
- Yeah.

56:09.374 --> 56:10.573
Shit.

56:10.575 --> 56:11.806
We're still not
picking him up,

56:11.808 --> 56:13.341
so let him down easy.

56:13.343 --> 56:14.576
Hey, how you doing?

56:14.578 --> 56:16.578
You stopped. Thank you.

56:16.580 --> 56:18.214
Thank you. Thank you both.

56:18.216 --> 56:19.683
- You're welcome.
- Thank you so much.

56:19.685 --> 56:20.817
<i>Even if you don't
give me ride,</i>

56:20.819 --> 56:22.919
thank you just for stopping.

56:22.921 --> 56:24.219
I was beginning to think

56:24.221 --> 56:25.721
black was the new
invisible out here.

56:25.723 --> 56:27.623
You know what I mean?
The gesture means a lot.

56:27.625 --> 56:29.024
Where are you headed?

56:29.026 --> 56:30.794
North. Worcester, Mass.

56:30.796 --> 56:33.029
Just trying to get to my kid's
birthday tomorrow.

56:33.031 --> 56:35.297
We're really sorry.
We're going south.

56:35.299 --> 56:37.665
We're going to JFK, so...

56:37.667 --> 56:38.801
How about this?

56:38.803 --> 56:40.203
There's a train station,

56:40.205 --> 56:42.337
it's like two miles south.
You take me there?

56:42.339 --> 56:43.471
Now, I don't see why...

56:43.473 --> 56:44.707
Are you fucking crazy?

56:44.709 --> 56:46.843
I'm gonna have to ask you...

56:46.845 --> 56:48.377
We got a Nervous Nelly here.

56:48.379 --> 56:51.013
So I know this is gonna sound
like a funny question,

56:51.015 --> 56:53.017
but are you a serial killer?

56:54.718 --> 56:56.085
No. No.

56:56.087 --> 56:57.987
I get it. There's a lot of
nuts out there.

56:57.989 --> 57:00.355
I am a stranger,
I am a hitchhiker...

57:00.357 --> 57:01.690
Satisfied?

57:01.692 --> 57:05.727
...but I swear to you,
I am not a serial killer.

57:05.729 --> 57:07.797
- Hmm...
- Well, did you notice how you

57:07.799 --> 57:08.998
emphasized the word "serial,"

57:09.000 --> 57:11.366
which makes it sound like

57:11.368 --> 57:15.203
<i>you're a killer,
just not a serial one.</i>

57:15.205 --> 57:16.339
Oh, man, okay.

57:16.341 --> 57:18.506
Now that was
totally unintentional.

57:18.508 --> 57:19.774
I promise you that.

57:19.776 --> 57:21.243
Didn't mean that.

57:21.245 --> 57:23.011
But you're still not saying,
"I'm not a killer."

57:23.013 --> 57:26.684
It seems like that's what
a non-killer would say.

57:27.384 --> 57:29.719
I'm an idiot, man. Idiot!

57:29.721 --> 57:31.319
I've been
a non-killer too long

57:31.321 --> 57:32.955
to not know
the non-killer rules.

57:32.957 --> 57:34.756
You know what I mean?

57:34.758 --> 57:36.924
How about this?
We'll give you a ride...

57:36.926 --> 57:38.326
Are you fucking crazy?

57:38.328 --> 57:39.428
Let me finish, Pete.

57:39.430 --> 57:41.763
We can give you
a ride to the station,

57:41.765 --> 57:42.998
but, and this is
a pretty big but,

57:43.000 --> 57:44.701
only if we can tie you up.

57:44.703 --> 57:46.335
That way you can't rape

57:46.337 --> 57:49.975
or kill or murder
Mr. Paranoia here.

57:55.479 --> 57:56.682
Uh...

57:59.450 --> 58:00.683
You okay?

58:00.685 --> 58:01.817
Those aren't too tight,
are they?

58:01.819 --> 58:03.819
Almost kill you.
Can't kill you.

58:05.723 --> 58:07.223
<i>Don't even joke around</i>

58:07.225 --> 58:08.390
with our driver.

58:08.392 --> 58:09.558
Sorry to interrupt.

58:09.560 --> 58:11.060
I'm still not getting
a phone signal here.

58:11.062 --> 58:13.094
Are you sure there's
a train station this way?

58:13.096 --> 58:15.498
100%. I grew up one town over.

58:15.500 --> 58:18.100
I used to play ice hockey
at the rink across the street.

58:18.102 --> 58:20.268
Just make a left up there.

58:20.270 --> 58:22.307
I don't see
street signs.

58:23.707 --> 58:25.475
We are fucked.

58:25.477 --> 58:26.776
Fucked!

58:26.778 --> 58:28.143
We're gonna miss our flight.

58:28.145 --> 58:29.377
- Take it easy, Pete.
- Do you realize that?

58:29.379 --> 58:30.980
Okay, then we'll catch
another one.

58:30.982 --> 58:32.614
Okay? It's not a big deal.

58:32.616 --> 58:36.752
Classic Kyle! Nothing's ever
a big deal. Must be nice.

58:36.754 --> 58:40.857
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I am sensing
a very disturbing vibe here.

58:40.859 --> 58:43.024
Pete, are you mad at your
brother about something?

58:43.026 --> 58:45.995
Yes! I'm mad!
And it's probably obvious.

58:45.997 --> 58:49.464
There's like a rage pulsing
through his entire body.

58:49.466 --> 58:51.332
Classic Pete right here.

58:51.334 --> 58:53.868
Luckily, I'm sort of
the Pete whisperer.

58:53.870 --> 58:56.739
I always know
how to calm this guy down.

58:56.741 --> 58:57.873
- Ah...
<i>- Good.</i>

58:57.875 --> 58:59.808
Let me turn on a little music

58:59.810 --> 59:02.745
and just lullaby you
into just relaxing.

59:02.747 --> 59:04.245
<i>- Wow.</i>
- There.

59:04.247 --> 59:08.451
A, please don't patronize me
and B, no music, okay?

59:08.453 --> 59:09.986
I just need
to focus right now.

59:09.988 --> 59:12.522
Well, I think music
will help you guys relax.

59:12.524 --> 59:14.089
Makes a great point.

59:14.091 --> 59:15.792
You can't focus
if you're too tense, Pete.

59:15.794 --> 59:17.194
I just need it quiet, okay?

59:21.933 --> 59:23.565
What are you, 10?

59:23.567 --> 59:25.100
Can't you just
listen to music?

59:25.102 --> 59:28.236
No! I don't want
to listen to music.

59:35.312 --> 59:37.782
Enough with the
fucking radio, Kyle!

59:40.817 --> 59:42.185
Oh, that was...

59:42.187 --> 59:44.652
That was brilliant.
Go get 'em, you idiot.

59:44.654 --> 59:45.987
I'm not gonna go get 'em.

59:45.989 --> 59:47.623
Untie me, I'll go get 'em.

59:47.625 --> 59:49.125
We're not gonna get the keys

59:49.127 --> 59:51.594
until you tell me what
your problem is with me.

59:51.596 --> 59:52.828
We're going to be here a while

59:52.830 --> 59:54.564
because I have a million
problems with you.

59:54.566 --> 59:56.933
- Like what?
- Yeah. Elaborate, Pete.

59:56.935 --> 01:00:01.670
All you've ever done is rub
your amazing life in my face.

01:00:01.672 --> 01:00:04.006
Your trophies and your friends

01:00:04.008 --> 01:00:06.776
and your black Amex
and your sunsets.

01:00:06.778 --> 01:00:08.877
Sorry for sending you sunsets.

01:00:08.879 --> 01:00:10.478
I love sunsets.

01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:11.513
Growing up was literally

01:00:11.515 --> 01:00:12.881
like watching
<i>The Kyle Reynolds Show</i>

01:00:12.883 --> 01:00:14.516
24 hours a day.

01:00:14.518 --> 01:00:15.718
Girls just liked you more.

01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:17.620
Pete, I thought you liked
hearing about my hook-ups

01:00:17.622 --> 01:00:20.589
the same way I liked hearing
about your hook-ups.

01:00:20.591 --> 01:00:21.957
What hook-ups?

01:00:21.959 --> 01:00:23.292
The girl you went out with
in ninth grade.

01:00:23.294 --> 01:00:25.227
Remember her, with the
glasses and the bad skin?

01:00:25.229 --> 01:00:26.529
- Pamela Hartley.
- Yes!

01:00:26.531 --> 01:00:28.364
Yeah, she only dated me
to get to you.

01:00:28.366 --> 01:00:30.399
And guess what? The second
her skin cleared up,

01:00:30.401 --> 01:00:31.399
he banged her.

01:00:31.401 --> 01:00:33.402
Not cool, Kyle.
I'm Team Peter.

01:00:33.404 --> 01:00:34.803
You even had
the balls to come home

01:00:34.805 --> 01:00:35.837
and brag about
how you nailed her

01:00:35.839 --> 01:00:37.071
in the back of a Papa John's.

01:00:37.073 --> 01:00:38.274
That girl that
I messed around with

01:00:38.276 --> 01:00:39.942
at Papa John's
didn't even wear glasses.

01:00:39.944 --> 01:00:41.676
Mistaken identity.
Back on Team Kyle.

01:00:41.678 --> 01:00:42.844
Guess what?

01:00:42.846 --> 01:00:44.480
Junior year, she got contacts

01:00:44.482 --> 01:00:46.248
and her skin cleared up
and you banged her

01:00:46.250 --> 01:00:49.218
right after having a sausage
lover's pizza, apparently.

01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:50.986
<i>"This chick loves
sausage, Pete."</i>

01:00:50.988 --> 01:00:52.254
I don't remember that.

01:00:52.256 --> 01:00:54.156
If I have to hear
about your goddamn

01:00:54.158 --> 01:00:56.558
barbeque sauce fortune
one more time.

01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:59.594
The picture on the bottles
could be literally anybody!

01:00:59.596 --> 01:01:02.564
And you've lucked out
your entire life.

01:01:02.566 --> 01:01:03.598
The way you've lived,

01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:05.067
you should be broke
and homeless,

01:01:05.069 --> 01:01:07.502
not chillaxing on a beach

01:01:07.504 --> 01:01:10.138
with your perfect girlfriend
and your perfect house

01:01:10.140 --> 01:01:11.908
and your soon-to-be
perfect family!

01:01:11.910 --> 01:01:13.209
Fuck you!

01:01:13.211 --> 01:01:15.411
Stop blaming me
for everything.

01:01:15.413 --> 01:01:18.580
You know, just because you
think your life sucks. Okay?

01:01:18.582 --> 01:01:19.915
Take some responsibility

01:01:19.917 --> 01:01:21.449
for some of the
decisions you made.

01:01:21.451 --> 01:01:23.218
You decide to
go ahead and marry

01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:24.754
the first girl
you ever mess around with,

01:01:24.756 --> 01:01:27.323
and then, big shocker,
it doesn't work out?

01:01:27.325 --> 01:01:29.859
You decide to look at
assholes for a living.

01:01:29.861 --> 01:01:31.393
That's my fault?

01:01:31.395 --> 01:01:34.062
Spent your whole life
trying to impress a dead guy.

01:01:34.064 --> 01:01:36.899
It's not my fault.
It's your fault.

01:01:36.901 --> 01:01:38.401
In fact, maybe if you tried

01:01:38.403 --> 01:01:40.102
to be like me
a little bit more,

01:01:40.104 --> 01:01:42.136
you wouldn't be
such a miserable dick!

01:01:42.138 --> 01:01:43.941
And your son
wouldn't hate you!

01:01:46.810 --> 01:01:49.310
God damn it.

01:01:49.312 --> 01:01:52.381
God damn it!
You broke my glasses.

01:01:52.383 --> 01:01:53.549
Fuck!

01:01:53.551 --> 01:01:54.949
Guys, use your words.

01:01:54.951 --> 01:01:56.518
Fuck you, Kyle!

01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:57.687
I hate conflict.

01:01:57.689 --> 01:01:59.321
Fuck you!

01:01:59.323 --> 01:02:00.556
Asshole!

01:02:00.558 --> 01:02:04.593
Hey, guys, my Negro
spider senses is tingling.

01:02:06.163 --> 01:02:09.399
I think we may be
on a choo-choo track.

01:02:09.401 --> 01:02:11.533
While you were lying on
a beach in Maui, I was home,

01:02:11.535 --> 01:02:12.835
taking care of Mom!

01:02:12.837 --> 01:02:14.536
I don't like this.

01:02:14.538 --> 01:02:16.605
<i>Yup, that is definitely
a choo-choo train.</i>

01:02:16.607 --> 01:02:18.341
Mom is an independent
vibrant sexual woman!

01:02:18.343 --> 01:02:19.442
Okay.

01:02:19.444 --> 01:02:21.911
<i>Stop taking care
of people!</i>

01:02:21.913 --> 01:02:23.745
It's not the soul train, guys.

01:02:23.747 --> 01:02:26.748
<i>You want to stop fighting
and look out the window...</i>

01:02:26.750 --> 01:02:29.886
Motherfuckers, we're on the
motherfucking railroad tracks!

01:02:29.888 --> 01:02:32.020
There's a train coming!

01:02:32.022 --> 01:02:34.623
There is a train!

01:02:34.625 --> 01:02:36.123
Get me off the tracks!

01:02:36.125 --> 01:02:37.593
Train. Pete, get out!

01:02:37.595 --> 01:02:39.064
Help! Now!

01:02:40.198 --> 01:02:41.700
Get out!

01:02:42.933 --> 01:02:44.134
My seatbelt!

01:02:50.475 --> 01:02:51.710
Kyle!

01:03:00.785 --> 01:03:02.053
Kyle!

01:03:26.044 --> 01:03:27.245
Pete!

01:03:29.546 --> 01:03:30.647
Pete!

01:03:33.852 --> 01:03:35.220
Kyle!

01:03:36.654 --> 01:03:38.156
Pete!

01:03:39.524 --> 01:03:41.857
Kyle!

01:03:41.859 --> 01:03:43.127
Pete!

01:03:44.729 --> 01:03:47.031
Yes!

01:03:55.105 --> 01:03:56.508
Yeah!

01:04:29.874 --> 01:04:31.373
No. They're literally

01:04:31.375 --> 01:04:33.676
replacing me
with a monkey or a seal,

01:04:33.678 --> 01:04:34.910
some kind of animal.

01:04:34.912 --> 01:04:37.245
Because apparently animals
don't get residuals.

01:04:37.247 --> 01:04:40.184
A monkey can't do your job.

01:04:42.553 --> 01:04:44.752
How much do you have left?

01:04:44.754 --> 01:04:46.823
Not as much as I owe.

01:04:46.825 --> 01:04:49.125
Yeah, I'll probably
have a repo man

01:04:49.127 --> 01:04:52.326
showing up at my house
in a few weeks.

01:04:52.328 --> 01:04:54.399
Take my Ferraris back.

01:04:55.165 --> 01:04:57.165
Ferraris, plural?

01:04:57.167 --> 01:04:58.470
Three.

01:04:59.803 --> 01:05:03.538
You are incorrigible.

01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:07.241
I'm just an idiot, Pete.
You said so yourself.

01:05:07.243 --> 01:05:09.578
You're not an idiot, Kyle.

01:05:09.580 --> 01:05:11.783
You're not, you're just...

01:05:12.216 --> 01:05:13.315
What?

01:05:13.317 --> 01:05:15.350
You're overly optimistic.

01:05:15.352 --> 01:05:16.484
That's all.

01:05:16.486 --> 01:05:19.356
That's a nice way to put it.

01:05:20.156 --> 01:05:21.290
Well, I don't know.

01:05:21.292 --> 01:05:23.560
Who am I kidding?

01:05:24.629 --> 01:05:26.060
I honestly started thinking

01:05:26.062 --> 01:05:27.362
that Kaylani and our kid

01:05:27.364 --> 01:05:29.131
would be better off
without me.

01:05:29.133 --> 01:05:31.466
Maybe I ought to
just bail now.

01:05:31.468 --> 01:05:34.803
For their sake because then,
maybe, Kaylani

01:05:34.805 --> 01:05:37.806
could tell the kid a cool
story the way Mom did.

01:05:37.808 --> 01:05:42.944
"Yeah, your dad was base
jumping into a volcano

01:05:42.946 --> 01:05:45.214
"and the lava got him."

01:05:45.216 --> 01:05:48.419
Or I was a brilliant doctor,
like you.

01:05:49.921 --> 01:05:53.825
You have the kindest heart of
anyone I have ever met.

01:05:56.993 --> 01:06:00.395
And a little while ago,
I thought I lost you forever,

01:06:00.397 --> 01:06:04.868
and it was the worst feeling
I've ever felt.

01:06:06.470 --> 01:06:09.207
No one's better off
without you, Kyle.

01:06:10.107 --> 01:06:12.674
You're gonna be a great dad.

01:06:12.676 --> 01:06:16.781
You know how you were always
asking Mom about Dad?

01:06:18.281 --> 01:06:21.616
I wasn't that curious.

01:06:21.618 --> 01:06:23.887
I think because I had you.

01:06:24.622 --> 01:06:25.888
What?

01:06:25.890 --> 01:06:29.058
Yeah, I had a lot of friends
and girlfriends

01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:30.459
and people that love me

01:06:30.461 --> 01:06:32.227
because I'm, kind of,
you know,

01:06:32.229 --> 01:06:34.263
bon vivant, a raconteur,

01:06:34.265 --> 01:06:36.464
or whatever you want to say.

01:06:36.466 --> 01:06:39.334
But you never thought
I was any of those things,

01:06:39.336 --> 01:06:41.437
but you were still there.

01:06:41.439 --> 01:06:42.837
Getting on me.

01:06:42.839 --> 01:06:45.373
"Hey! Don't jump off the roof
into the pool.

01:06:45.375 --> 01:06:46.841
"You'll break your neck.

01:06:46.843 --> 01:06:49.446
"Here, let me show you
how to tie your tie."

01:06:50.379 --> 01:06:52.180
Always kind of thought

01:06:52.182 --> 01:06:54.886
that was the type of stuff
our dad would've been saying.

01:06:58.154 --> 01:07:00.256
I'm sorry about your glasses.

01:07:00.258 --> 01:07:01.422
Don't be.

01:07:01.424 --> 01:07:03.324
I don't need them.

01:07:03.326 --> 01:07:04.526
What do you mean?

01:07:04.528 --> 01:07:07.228
I don't need glasses.

01:07:07.230 --> 01:07:09.366
I have 20/20 vision.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.232
What?

01:07:11.234 --> 01:07:12.600
Yeah, I just had this image

01:07:12.602 --> 01:07:14.368
of who I thought I should be

01:07:14.370 --> 01:07:17.205
and glasses fit the bill.

01:07:17.207 --> 01:07:18.506
There you go.

01:07:18.508 --> 01:07:21.509
That's why you're brilliant.

01:07:21.511 --> 01:07:24.245
Why did I wear glasses
for 20 years?

01:07:24.247 --> 01:07:26.381
Because you're an idiot.

01:07:26.383 --> 01:07:28.216
I'm a fucking idiot.

01:07:28.218 --> 01:07:30.953
I'm a big dumb idiot.

01:07:30.955 --> 01:07:33.589
Boom! That's right.

01:07:33.591 --> 01:07:35.558
"Oh, my God! I'm still alive!"

01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:38.125
And that's basically
how it all went.

01:07:38.127 --> 01:07:41.230
It's crazy. This is one night
we're talking about.

01:07:41.232 --> 01:07:42.230
Yeah.

01:07:42.232 --> 01:07:43.297
Yeah.

01:07:43.299 --> 01:07:44.766
I guess we missed our flight.

01:07:44.768 --> 01:07:47.236
You want to check
and see when the next one is?

01:07:47.238 --> 01:07:48.473
Nope.

01:07:50.408 --> 01:07:52.073
I feel

01:07:52.075 --> 01:07:54.375
very confident
that the universe

01:07:54.377 --> 01:07:57.645
is telling us to proceed

01:07:57.647 --> 01:07:59.513
with Operation
Who's Your Daddy.

01:07:59.515 --> 01:08:01.248
Are you messing with me?

01:08:01.250 --> 01:08:02.685
We started
this goddamn mission

01:08:02.687 --> 01:08:03.953
to find our father together,

01:08:03.955 --> 01:08:05.953
and we are gonna
finish it together.

01:08:05.955 --> 01:08:07.288
Come hell or high water.

01:08:07.290 --> 01:08:09.559
God damn it,
that's the spirit!

01:08:11.395 --> 01:08:13.460
Let's do this!

01:08:13.462 --> 01:08:14.629
We're going in!

01:08:14.631 --> 01:08:15.997
We're going in!

01:08:15.999 --> 01:08:18.599
This is happening!

01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:20.602
Thank you
for driving all the way

01:08:20.604 --> 01:08:22.136
out here with the new rental.

01:08:22.138 --> 01:08:23.671
Appreciate it.

01:08:23.673 --> 01:08:25.640
Okay, guys,
I think these might be yours?

01:08:25.642 --> 01:08:27.341
Yes, sir. Thank you.

01:08:27.343 --> 01:08:28.810
All right.

01:08:28.812 --> 01:08:30.412
That's gonna be one big
fucking insurance mess.

01:08:30.413 --> 01:08:32.580
But we got everything we need,

01:08:32.582 --> 01:08:34.015
so you're free to go.

01:08:34.017 --> 01:08:35.283
Thanks a lot, officers.

01:08:35.285 --> 01:08:36.417
It's no problem.

01:08:36.419 --> 01:08:38.554
Really appreciate it.

01:08:38.555 --> 01:08:41.421
What now?
How do we find Sparkly P?

01:08:41.424 --> 01:08:42.890
- Leg work.
- Yes.

01:08:42.893 --> 01:08:45.895
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Did you just say "Sparkly P"?

01:08:46.962 --> 01:08:48.063
Yeah.

01:08:48.064 --> 01:08:49.997
- The police officer...
- From the '70s?

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.064
Yeah.

01:08:51.067 --> 01:08:52.166
You've heard of him?

01:08:52.167 --> 01:08:53.501
Are you kidding me?

01:08:53.502 --> 01:08:55.403
There's not a cop in the
whole state who hasn't.

01:08:55.404 --> 01:08:56.638
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:08:56.640 --> 01:09:00.041
Patrick O'Callaghan
aka Sparkly P.

01:09:00.042 --> 01:09:02.478
Had one of the biggest
coke busts in history.

01:09:02.479 --> 01:09:03.679
We spent like two weeks

01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:05.113
studying him
back in the academy.

01:09:05.115 --> 01:09:06.415
The guy's a legend.

01:09:06.417 --> 01:09:09.350
Holy shit, Pete.
We could be Irish.

01:09:09.352 --> 01:09:10.653
Yes!

01:09:10.654 --> 01:09:13.287
I'm Irish, too,
on my sister's side.

01:09:13.290 --> 01:09:14.926
You know where to find him?

01:09:18.060 --> 01:09:21.529
So, I just talked to my buddy
in the force

01:09:21.531 --> 01:09:25.501
and apparently
Mr. Patrick O'Callaghan

01:09:25.502 --> 01:09:28.837
retired the NYPD back in '86.

01:09:28.839 --> 01:09:31.473
This right here
is his last known address.

01:09:31.475 --> 01:09:32.674
If anyone comes asking,

01:09:32.676 --> 01:09:34.477
I didn't tell you shit.

01:09:34.479 --> 01:09:36.613
I'm trusting you with this.

01:09:37.212 --> 01:09:39.514
Don't fuck me.

01:09:39.515 --> 01:09:41.618
Not gonna fuck you.

01:09:48.493 --> 01:09:49.694
What?

01:09:52.194 --> 01:09:53.428
What?

01:09:53.430 --> 01:09:55.363
- Guess where he lives?
- Where?

01:09:55.365 --> 01:09:57.166
You're not gonna believe this.

01:09:57.168 --> 01:09:58.936
Worcester, Mass.

01:09:59.971 --> 01:10:01.169
<i>Worcester, Mass!</i>

01:10:01.171 --> 01:10:02.891
You've been leading us
there the whole time!

01:10:05.007 --> 01:10:08.510
<i>It's the universe, Pete.
The universe is magic!</i>

01:10:08.512 --> 01:10:10.377
<i>I'm magic.
I'm a magic man.</i>

01:10:10.379 --> 01:10:14.584
<i>All right. Okay.
I guess we're all going home.</i>

01:10:21.926 --> 01:10:23.093
Well,

01:10:24.794 --> 01:10:27.363
thanks for letting me keep
a little souvenir.

01:10:27.365 --> 01:10:28.764
Sure.

01:10:28.766 --> 01:10:31.567
This has been magnificent.
Thank you, guys.

01:10:31.569 --> 01:10:33.568
I appreciate your assistance.

01:10:33.570 --> 01:10:35.640
Have a good night.

01:10:36.539 --> 01:10:37.774
<i>Hey!</i>

01:10:38.409 --> 01:10:39.541
Yeah?

01:10:39.543 --> 01:10:41.277
We don't even know your name.

01:10:41.279 --> 01:10:42.944
<i>Oh, Kyle,</i>

01:10:42.946 --> 01:10:45.917
you've known it
the whole time.

01:10:47.551 --> 01:10:49.550
That's beautiful.

01:10:49.552 --> 01:10:51.118
I think he's messing with us.

01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:52.321
No, he's not.

01:10:52.323 --> 01:10:54.288
- Yeah, yeah.
- No.

01:10:54.290 --> 01:10:55.860
He was messing with us.

01:11:14.110 --> 01:11:15.376
Ding!

01:11:15.378 --> 01:11:17.813
May we get a room?

01:11:17.815 --> 01:11:20.882
Your cheapest room, please.

01:11:20.884 --> 01:11:23.887
Well, every
room in here is cheap, so...

01:11:26.056 --> 01:11:27.221
Sorry?

01:11:27.223 --> 01:11:29.192
Every room
in here is really cheap.

01:11:32.128 --> 01:11:34.097
Okay. Here you go.

01:11:35.266 --> 01:11:37.131
We're gonna nab one from ya.

01:11:37.133 --> 01:11:40.468
So, just the one room?

01:11:40.470 --> 01:11:41.672
Mmm-hmm.

01:11:42.439 --> 01:11:43.938
One night?

01:11:43.940 --> 01:11:45.075
Yeah.

01:11:45.508 --> 01:11:46.711
Two beds.

01:11:49.012 --> 01:11:51.078
Oh. Um...

01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:54.215
Can we still get food
and drinks at the bar?

01:11:54.217 --> 01:11:56.451
Right back there behind you.

01:11:56.453 --> 01:11:58.752
Food for about another

01:11:58.754 --> 01:12:02.058
10 minutes,
and drinks till 2:00.

01:12:03.026 --> 01:12:04.291
Till, sorry?

01:12:04.293 --> 01:12:06.027
Till 2:00.

01:12:06.029 --> 01:12:08.162
You're going to have to
speak up, Biz Markie,

01:12:08.164 --> 01:12:09.764
'cause I can't hear you.

01:12:09.766 --> 01:12:11.232
For 10 more minutes,

01:12:11.234 --> 01:12:12.803
and drinks until 2:00.

01:12:17.975 --> 01:12:19.209
<i>Okay.</i>

01:12:21.912 --> 01:12:24.645
Hey, do you remember

01:12:24.647 --> 01:12:27.215
when Mom tried to
teach us about sex?

01:12:27.217 --> 01:12:29.451
Yeah.

01:12:29.453 --> 01:12:30.785
You had already Papa John'd

01:12:30.787 --> 01:12:33.255
half the girls at school
at that point.

01:12:33.257 --> 01:12:35.357
Turns out, we probably
should have listened to her.

01:12:35.359 --> 01:12:36.657
Amen.

01:12:36.659 --> 01:12:38.794
It's like we passed up
basketball tips

01:12:38.796 --> 01:12:40.761
from Michael Jordan,
as it turns out.

01:12:40.763 --> 01:12:42.330
We really did.

01:12:44.801 --> 01:12:47.672
I'm gonna hit the head.
Excuse me.

01:13:12.061 --> 01:13:14.362
Hi, excuse me.
I couldn't help but notice

01:13:14.364 --> 01:13:16.297
<i>that you're</i>

01:13:16.299 --> 01:13:17.465
crying.

01:13:17.467 --> 01:13:20.635
No. I'm fine.

01:13:20.637 --> 01:13:22.104
I often have
that effect on women.

01:13:22.106 --> 01:13:24.372
Just not usually this fast.

01:13:24.374 --> 01:13:25.706
<i>Sorry. I'll leave you alone.</i>

01:13:25.708 --> 01:13:28.077
No. You know what,
please don't.

01:13:28.079 --> 01:13:29.676
Just sit.

01:13:29.678 --> 01:13:30.881
Buy me a drink.

01:13:33.449 --> 01:13:35.116
All right.

01:13:35.118 --> 01:13:36.518
Another...

01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:37.653
Scotch on the rocks.

01:13:37.655 --> 01:13:38.921
Oh, nice.

01:13:38.923 --> 01:13:40.858
- Make that two.
<i>- Right up.</i>

01:13:43.726 --> 01:13:45.328
Thank you.

01:13:48.664 --> 01:13:49.866
So,

01:13:50.833 --> 01:13:52.168
want to talk about it?

01:13:53.971 --> 01:13:54.972
No.

01:13:57.940 --> 01:13:59.676
No sob stories.

01:14:02.245 --> 01:14:03.612
I like that rule.

01:14:03.614 --> 01:14:05.679
Cheers.

01:14:05.681 --> 01:14:06.814
No sob stories.

01:14:06.816 --> 01:14:08.084
All right.

01:14:09.218 --> 01:14:11.319
<i>Do you
want to talk about</i>

01:14:11.321 --> 01:14:12.787
that?

01:14:12.789 --> 01:14:14.225
- This?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:14:16.192 --> 01:14:17.828
Uh... Well...

01:14:20.530 --> 01:14:22.330
I can't.

01:14:22.332 --> 01:14:23.734
Why?

01:14:25.034 --> 01:14:27.137
Because I'm a secret agent.

01:14:28.570 --> 01:14:31.374
I don't think you were
supposed to tell me that part.

01:14:32.476 --> 01:14:33.774
Well...

01:14:33.776 --> 01:14:36.511
Why don't you
let me worry about

01:14:36.513 --> 01:14:39.947
how secret agent-ing works,

01:14:39.949 --> 01:14:41.416
<i>seeing as how I am
the secret agent.</i>

01:14:41.418 --> 01:14:42.884
<i>You're right.</i>

01:14:42.886 --> 01:14:44.618
You should see the other guy.

01:14:44.620 --> 01:14:45.854
Sorry to interrupt, Peter.

01:14:45.856 --> 01:14:47.022
I just got an urgent call
from the client.

01:14:47.024 --> 01:14:48.189
I'm gonna have to go in.

01:14:48.191 --> 01:14:50.457
Apparently old Gary Peterson

01:14:50.459 --> 01:14:53.060
really shat the bed
on the LBJ proposal.

01:14:53.062 --> 01:14:55.063
Guy's just useless.

01:14:55.065 --> 01:14:57.765
He's been screwing up
since the beginning.

01:14:57.767 --> 01:14:59.067
Anyway,
I'm gonna go in the office,

01:14:59.069 --> 01:15:00.300
I'm probably going
to spend the night,

01:15:00.302 --> 01:15:01.336
and I will see you
tomorrow, okay?

01:15:01.338 --> 01:15:02.470
Are you sure?

01:15:02.472 --> 01:15:03.940
I'm gonna see you tomorrow.

01:15:05.475 --> 01:15:06.977
All right.

01:15:08.544 --> 01:15:10.345
Was that the other guy?

01:15:10.347 --> 01:15:11.947
He looks like shit.

01:15:11.949 --> 01:15:14.081
That guy's actually
my partner.

01:15:14.083 --> 01:15:15.884
He's another secret agent.

01:15:15.886 --> 01:15:18.053
See, you keep saying "secret,"

01:15:18.055 --> 01:15:20.654
but then you keep
telling me about it.

01:15:20.656 --> 01:15:23.425
I am failing at this job.

01:15:23.427 --> 01:15:25.093
I will tell you this...

01:15:25.095 --> 01:15:27.194
I'm also a secret agent.

01:15:27.196 --> 01:15:28.662
No!

01:15:28.664 --> 01:15:30.099
Sent here to kill you.

01:15:30.101 --> 01:15:30.965
What?

01:15:30.967 --> 01:15:33.367
That drink, it's poison.

01:15:33.369 --> 01:15:34.803
Wait, what?

01:15:34.805 --> 01:15:36.171
Sorry.

01:15:36.173 --> 01:15:38.372
You surreptitiously
poisoned me?

01:15:38.374 --> 01:15:40.041
Surreptitiously.

01:15:40.043 --> 01:15:43.881
You're so good.
I had no idea this is poison.

01:15:45.516 --> 01:15:48.884
Yeah! That's, like,
almost all poison.

01:15:48.886 --> 01:15:50.585
No, taste mine.
You'll taste the difference.

01:15:50.587 --> 01:15:52.156
- Little bit.
- Yeah.

01:15:53.190 --> 01:15:54.288
Mmm.

01:15:54.290 --> 01:15:55.223
Poison.

01:15:55.225 --> 01:15:56.425
There is a little
difference, yeah.

01:15:56.427 --> 01:15:57.792
- Yeah.
- I do taste that.

01:15:57.794 --> 01:16:02.197
So, I'm sorry to tell you,
but two hours left to live.

01:16:02.199 --> 01:16:05.634
Well, guess I'd better
make these two hours count.

01:16:05.636 --> 01:16:06.768
Yeah, you better.

01:16:06.770 --> 01:16:08.336
Yeah.

01:16:08.338 --> 01:16:10.071
My name is Sarah.

01:16:10.073 --> 01:16:12.977
Code name Babydoll.

01:16:13.976 --> 01:16:16.310
Well, Sarah, my name's Peter.

01:16:16.312 --> 01:16:18.214
Code name...

01:16:20.583 --> 01:16:22.649
Pinky Pants.

01:16:22.651 --> 01:16:23.785
I've heard about you.

01:16:23.787 --> 01:16:25.420
Yeah, I'm legendary.

01:16:25.422 --> 01:16:26.955
Well,

01:16:26.957 --> 01:16:29.192
here's to your last two hours.

01:16:35.598 --> 01:16:39.065
<i>Hi. Hey! Can you see me?</i>

01:16:39.067 --> 01:16:41.403
- <i>Aloha.</i>
- Aloha.

01:16:41.405 --> 01:16:43.537
<i>Are you ready
for naked Facetime?</i>

01:16:43.539 --> 01:16:44.605
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:16:44.607 --> 01:16:45.974
<i>I'm wearing your favorite bra.</i>

01:16:45.976 --> 01:16:47.309
<i>Oh, my gosh.</i>

01:16:47.311 --> 01:16:49.810
<i>Wait, why aren't you naked?</i>

01:16:49.812 --> 01:16:52.313
<i>- Um...
- Where are you?</i>

01:16:52.315 --> 01:16:54.314
I'm actually in the car.
I'm just kind of settling in.

01:16:54.316 --> 01:16:56.617
I'm trying to give Pete
a little privacy

01:16:56.619 --> 01:16:58.019
because he met a girl.

01:16:58.021 --> 01:16:59.223
Oh.

01:17:01.357 --> 01:17:02.359
Hey.

01:17:03.892 --> 01:17:05.961
Got some
room service out here.

01:17:05.963 --> 01:17:07.261
Yeah, bet you don't deliver

01:17:07.263 --> 01:17:08.796
out to the parking lot
too much,

01:17:08.798 --> 01:17:11.599
but I'm just trying to give
my brother some privacy.

01:17:11.601 --> 01:17:14.736
Here, wave to Kaylani.
That's the room service guy.

01:17:14.738 --> 01:17:16.004
<i>Hi, room service dude.</i>

01:17:16.006 --> 01:17:17.240
Okay. Thank you.

01:17:18.475 --> 01:17:20.207
Okay.

01:17:20.209 --> 01:17:22.376
I might get some
breakfast later.

01:17:22.378 --> 01:17:23.881
No problem.

01:17:26.216 --> 01:17:27.852
<i>How's your trip been?</i>

01:17:33.022 --> 01:17:34.456
Hey, honey,

01:17:34.458 --> 01:17:36.023
there's something
I need to tell you.

01:17:36.025 --> 01:17:37.391
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

01:17:37.393 --> 01:17:39.594
No, everything's going great
with the trip.

01:17:40.763 --> 01:17:42.432
It's kind of a recent setback.

01:17:43.933 --> 01:17:45.399
<i>What's up?</i>

01:17:45.401 --> 01:17:48.471
I think it's gonna be
good, actually.

01:17:58.781 --> 01:17:59.880
There's so many buttons.

01:17:59.882 --> 01:18:00.947
- <i>Here...</i>
- Help.

01:18:00.949 --> 01:18:02.349
I'll help and go
from the bottom.

01:18:02.351 --> 01:18:04.051
- Here we go.
- Help.

01:18:04.053 --> 01:18:06.390
Oh, God. That's really
slowing me down.

01:18:15.766 --> 01:18:17.998
Oh, my God. You have buttons.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.868
Listen, there's something
you should know.

01:18:20.870 --> 01:18:22.871
What?

01:18:22.873 --> 01:18:24.438
I don't manscape.

01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:26.541
Well, what are we
working with?

01:18:26.543 --> 01:18:28.376
Well, here you go.

01:18:28.378 --> 01:18:29.513
Oh, no.

01:18:31.882 --> 01:18:33.715
It is what it is.

01:18:33.717 --> 01:18:35.018
Works for me.

01:18:51.567 --> 01:18:53.003
Ahoy!

01:19:00.075 --> 01:19:01.475
Good morning.

01:19:01.477 --> 01:19:02.844
Good morning.

01:19:02.846 --> 01:19:04.612
Yes. Yes.

01:19:04.614 --> 01:19:07.418
Any news to report?

01:19:08.017 --> 01:19:09.218
Um...

01:19:13.756 --> 01:19:15.857
You are incorrigible.

01:19:15.859 --> 01:19:17.358
Where is she?

01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:20.361
I don't know actually.
I woke up and she was gone.

01:19:20.363 --> 01:19:24.232
You experienced
a pure one-night stand.

01:19:24.234 --> 01:19:25.565
Do you know how rare that is?

01:19:25.567 --> 01:19:27.068
You were visited by
an angel last night.

01:19:27.070 --> 01:19:28.437
Plain and simple.

01:19:28.439 --> 01:19:31.475
Well, she did,
she did leave a note.

01:19:33.310 --> 01:19:37.013
"Thanks for a really
fun night. I needed it."

01:19:38.481 --> 01:19:40.215
"I needed it!"

01:19:40.217 --> 01:19:42.686
Guess who gave it to her?
This guy!

01:19:45.222 --> 01:19:48.055
<i>I just like
seeing you giddy.</i>

01:19:48.057 --> 01:19:49.957
You're just gleeful.

01:19:49.959 --> 01:19:52.827
This is the Pete
I've been trying to get.

01:19:52.829 --> 01:19:54.095
<i>Come on, Worcester!</i>

01:19:54.097 --> 01:19:55.499
Come on.

01:19:58.968 --> 01:20:00.568
Okay.

01:20:00.570 --> 01:20:01.935
<i>You have
arrived at your destination.</i>

01:20:01.937 --> 01:20:03.473
<i>This is it.</i>

01:20:06.775 --> 01:20:09.277
Sparkly P likes to party.

01:20:16.753 --> 01:20:18.489
Breathe.

01:20:20.257 --> 01:20:22.255
What is going on?

01:20:22.257 --> 01:20:23.757
<i>Dad gets Clemens to come</i>

01:20:23.759 --> 01:20:26.094
<i>and pitch batting practice
for us at the park.</i>

01:20:26.096 --> 01:20:27.394
Fucker beaned me,

01:20:27.396 --> 01:20:29.296
like, twice but still
greatest day of my life.

01:20:29.298 --> 01:20:30.998
Hey, fellas. Welcome.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:32.132
Thank you.

01:20:32.134 --> 01:20:33.800
There's beer, liquor.

01:20:33.802 --> 01:20:35.403
There's food in the back.

01:20:35.405 --> 01:20:36.804
Make yourselves at home.

01:20:38.208 --> 01:20:41.809
Hey, I am so fuckin' happy
you're my brother.

01:20:41.811 --> 01:20:43.478
I love you so much.

01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:45.647
I love you too, bro.
You know.

01:20:45.649 --> 01:20:49.483
Okay. Sorry to interrupt.
Do you know if Paddy's here?

01:20:49.485 --> 01:20:51.919
Oh, yeah. Dad's inside.

01:20:51.921 --> 01:20:56.159
Come on. He's in the study.
I'll take you over. Come on.

01:20:59.029 --> 01:21:01.198
Oh, Dad's over there, guys.

01:21:15.345 --> 01:21:17.578
So, how do you guys
know my dad?

01:21:17.580 --> 01:21:20.081
Liam, Sean needs your help
changing the keg.

01:21:20.083 --> 01:21:21.849
Oh, for fuck's sakes.

01:21:21.851 --> 01:21:24.452
Sorry, fellas,
my brother's a moron.

01:21:24.454 --> 01:21:25.819
Hey. Watch your mouth.

01:21:25.821 --> 01:21:27.522
That's my boyfriend
you're talking about.

01:21:27.524 --> 01:21:29.090
<i>My fuckin' 10-year-old
cousin can change a keg.</i>

01:21:29.092 --> 01:21:30.393
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

01:21:35.531 --> 01:21:37.266
Oh, man.

01:21:38.500 --> 01:21:41.469
I'm sorry we're too late.

01:21:41.471 --> 01:21:43.707
I would have really
loved to get to know you.

01:21:45.307 --> 01:21:47.974
He seems like a good man.

01:21:47.976 --> 01:21:51.147
Raised a good family.

01:21:53.883 --> 01:21:56.119
Did he just die?

01:21:57.654 --> 01:21:59.653
Presumably, yeah.

01:21:59.655 --> 01:22:03.023
<i>Do you think he died
in the line of duty?</i>

01:22:03.025 --> 01:22:05.760
<i>Paddy O'Callaghan</i>

01:22:05.762 --> 01:22:08.796
was many things
to many people.

01:22:08.798 --> 01:22:11.765
<i>There was no role
he treasured more</i>

01:22:11.767 --> 01:22:13.635
than being a father.

01:22:13.637 --> 01:22:15.169
<i>And I know there's no one</i>

01:22:15.171 --> 01:22:17.238
he would rather hear
from right now

01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:20.074
than his dear sweet daughter.

01:22:20.076 --> 01:22:22.711
<i>Are you okay to talk, hon?</i>

01:22:22.713 --> 01:22:24.148
Thank you, Father.

01:22:28.017 --> 01:22:29.449
<i>My father and I</i>

01:22:29.451 --> 01:22:31.685
<i>didn't always get along.</i>

01:22:31.687 --> 01:22:34.554
He was a cop
who saw the worst in people.

01:22:34.556 --> 01:22:37.457
That's the girl
from last night.

01:22:37.459 --> 01:22:38.859
<i>He practically
arrested this...</i>

01:22:38.861 --> 01:22:39.930
No.

01:22:41.330 --> 01:22:42.662
<i>That's Babydoll.</i>

01:22:42.664 --> 01:22:43.831
I saw...

01:22:43.833 --> 01:22:45.666
Oh, my God.

01:22:45.668 --> 01:22:48.336
We've all slept with
the wrong woman.

01:22:48.338 --> 01:22:49.903
Yeah, but it's our sister.

01:22:49.905 --> 01:22:53.741
No, I know. But I've slept
with some squirrelly women.

01:22:53.743 --> 01:22:55.542
Super squirrelly.

01:22:55.544 --> 01:22:57.845
<i>It doesn't matter
how squirrelly they are,</i>

01:22:57.847 --> 01:22:59.281
<i>they're not our sister.</i>

01:22:59.283 --> 01:23:01.482
No, listen to me.
It didn't happen, okay?

01:23:01.484 --> 01:23:03.417
It didn't happen.
Just erase it.

01:23:03.419 --> 01:23:05.687
It didn't happen!

01:23:05.689 --> 01:23:08.723
Is that why it was so good?

01:23:08.725 --> 01:23:10.692
<i>I'm a monster.</i>

01:23:10.694 --> 01:23:12.661
I love you, Pop.

01:23:12.663 --> 01:23:15.363
I'm gonna miss you so much.

01:23:15.365 --> 01:23:16.964
- We have to go.
- No!

01:23:16.966 --> 01:23:19.134
Stop. Peter. Peter, stop.

01:23:19.136 --> 01:23:20.335
Peter!

01:23:20.337 --> 01:23:21.402
Peter!

01:23:21.404 --> 01:23:22.504
The fuck!

01:23:22.506 --> 01:23:24.337
<i>What the fuck! Sean!</i>

01:23:24.339 --> 01:23:26.642
It wasn't fucking me.

01:23:27.744 --> 01:23:28.776
Did he get you?

01:23:28.778 --> 01:23:31.010
Don't touch! Oh, my...
Get your...

01:23:31.012 --> 01:23:32.412
Hey, douchebag!

01:23:32.414 --> 01:23:35.148
- Where's the apology?
- Whoa. Hey. I'm sorry.

01:23:35.150 --> 01:23:37.218
- Where's the apology?
- Jesus!

01:23:37.220 --> 01:23:39.153
What were you talkin' about?

01:23:39.155 --> 01:23:40.287
Just let us go.

01:23:40.289 --> 01:23:41.555
Why are you not apologizing?

01:23:41.557 --> 01:23:44.024
Hey, stop. Come here. Stop it.

01:23:44.026 --> 01:23:45.259
Contact, bro?

01:23:45.261 --> 01:23:47.193
Contact in O'Callaghan's yard?

01:23:47.195 --> 01:23:48.395
Okay, just stop! Hold it!

01:23:48.397 --> 01:23:49.529
In my yard?

01:23:49.531 --> 01:23:50.898
Hey! We just want an apology!

01:23:50.900 --> 01:23:52.666
Come on,
just say you're sorry.

01:23:52.668 --> 01:23:54.368
- I'd really rather not.
- Peter, come on!

01:23:54.370 --> 01:23:55.803
Summer's over,
you ready for the fall?

01:23:55.805 --> 01:23:57.238
Don't be prideful.
Come on, just...

01:23:57.240 --> 01:23:58.872
I'm not being prideful.

01:23:58.874 --> 01:24:01.242
It's hard to apologize when I
just got shoved off a porch.

01:24:01.244 --> 01:24:02.776
Charged up!

01:24:02.778 --> 01:24:04.879
I saw you spill the drink on
the girl. She's soaked.

01:24:04.881 --> 01:24:06.413
That's true,
and I am sorry about that.

01:24:06.415 --> 01:24:08.349
Okay, but don't tell me,
tell them! Just say it.

01:24:08.351 --> 01:24:09.849
- Fine!
<i>- Fuck you guys!</i>

01:24:09.851 --> 01:24:10.921
I'm sorry!

01:24:13.323 --> 01:24:14.721
To who?

01:24:14.723 --> 01:24:17.358
To the douchebag's girlfriend.

01:24:19.829 --> 01:24:21.465
Close enough.

01:24:23.565 --> 01:24:25.366
- It's too late.
<i>- What?</i>

01:24:25.368 --> 01:24:27.868
Look, you can't
move the goalpost.

01:24:27.870 --> 01:24:28.935
They moved.

01:24:28.937 --> 01:24:30.104
He just apologized.

01:24:30.106 --> 01:24:31.872
That's more than I've ever
gotten from him.

01:24:31.874 --> 01:24:34.375
Come on, you're lucky we're
not demanding an apology!

01:24:34.377 --> 01:24:35.576
He wants an apology.

01:24:35.578 --> 01:24:37.577
Here's an apology, bro.

01:24:37.579 --> 01:24:39.949
- That's an O'Callaghan sorry.
- Whoa!

01:24:45.053 --> 01:24:46.687
I got his ankle, Pete!

01:24:46.689 --> 01:24:48.057
I got him in a foot lock.

01:24:51.061 --> 01:24:52.426
I'm gonna sprain his ankle.

01:24:52.428 --> 01:24:54.495
Hey, hey! What are
you boys doing? Get up!

01:24:54.497 --> 01:24:57.034
What the hell's going on,
boys? Huh?

01:24:58.267 --> 01:24:59.468
Whoa!

01:25:00.102 --> 01:25:01.769
Paddy!

01:25:01.771 --> 01:25:02.836
He's alive!

01:25:02.838 --> 01:25:04.505
<i>It's not Paddy,
you idiot.</i>

01:25:04.507 --> 01:25:05.706
That's our Uncle Kevin.

01:25:05.708 --> 01:25:07.308
He's Paddy's twin brother.

01:25:07.310 --> 01:25:09.475
My brother's
lying dead in there.

01:25:09.477 --> 01:25:10.912
Show a little respect.

01:25:10.914 --> 01:25:12.316
- For Christ's sake.
- Peter?

01:25:13.016 --> 01:25:14.282
Hey.

01:25:14.284 --> 01:25:16.349
What are you doing here?

01:25:16.351 --> 01:25:18.318
Wait a minute,
you know this d-bag?

01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:19.720
Yeah.

01:25:19.722 --> 01:25:21.087
Wait, is this the guy
from last night?

01:25:21.089 --> 01:25:22.422
What guy from last night?

01:25:22.424 --> 01:25:23.556
Is he why
you didn't come home?

01:25:23.558 --> 01:25:25.225
Did you fuck our sister?

01:25:25.227 --> 01:25:27.028
- Oh, God.
- Language.

01:25:27.030 --> 01:25:28.929
Did you eff our sister?

01:25:28.931 --> 01:25:29.997
That's better.

01:25:29.999 --> 01:25:32.632
Stop it, you guys.
I'm a grown woman!

01:25:32.634 --> 01:25:34.068
Easy. She's right, boys. Easy.

01:25:34.070 --> 01:25:36.037
Come on.
We're acting like animals.

01:25:36.039 --> 01:25:38.206
I'm pretty sure that your
sister's had sex before,

01:25:38.208 --> 01:25:41.074
and I can tell you that Peter
is a considerate lover.

01:25:41.076 --> 01:25:42.609
- Oh, God!
<i>- I'll vouch for that.</i>

01:25:42.611 --> 01:25:44.678
<i>You come to my home.</i>

01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:48.517
To my father's wake the day
after fucking my sister?

01:25:49.518 --> 01:25:51.184
I'm going to break your dick.

01:25:51.186 --> 01:25:53.220
Liam, hold off.

01:25:53.222 --> 01:25:55.590
I know I was saying
relax a couple of seconds ago.

01:25:55.592 --> 01:25:57.224
But if someone
came over to my house

01:25:57.226 --> 01:25:58.591
and effed my grieving sister,

01:25:58.593 --> 01:26:00.461
I'm pretty sure
that I'd want to

01:26:00.463 --> 01:26:01.961
just rip him
limb to limb, okay?

01:26:01.963 --> 01:26:04.064
I'd want to
just mutilate his ass.

01:26:04.066 --> 01:26:05.199
What?

01:26:05.201 --> 01:26:06.500
Deservedly.

01:26:06.502 --> 01:26:07.801
But guess what?

01:26:07.803 --> 01:26:08.935
What?

01:26:08.937 --> 01:26:11.973
Someone did just eff
my grieving sister.

01:26:11.975 --> 01:26:13.541
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- What?

01:26:13.543 --> 01:26:15.242
Peter, do the honors.
Chime in.

01:26:15.244 --> 01:26:16.443
- No!
- Chime in.

01:26:16.445 --> 01:26:18.813
I don't think
we should do the honors.

01:26:18.815 --> 01:26:23.086
Liam, Sean, darling Sarah...

01:26:24.454 --> 01:26:27.354
Paddy's our father.
You're our brothers.

01:26:27.356 --> 01:26:28.857
You're our sister.

01:26:28.859 --> 01:26:29.924
What?

01:26:29.926 --> 01:26:31.625
What the fuck
are you talking about?

01:26:31.627 --> 01:26:33.693
What the hell is going on?

01:26:33.695 --> 01:26:35.596
Our mom's name
is Helen Baxter.

01:26:35.598 --> 01:26:37.467
Did Paddy ever mention her?

01:26:38.767 --> 01:26:40.904
- You're Helen's boys?
- Yes!

01:26:41.436 --> 01:26:42.635
The twins?

01:26:44.607 --> 01:26:46.509
You don't pick your family.

01:26:47.209 --> 01:26:48.442
Oh, God!

01:26:48.444 --> 01:26:49.510
<i>I'm gonna
fucking kill you!</i>

01:26:49.512 --> 01:26:50.577
I'm going to fucking kill you!

01:26:50.579 --> 01:26:51.644
Seanie! Seanie!

01:26:51.646 --> 01:26:54.081
Stop it!
You two stay right here.

01:26:54.083 --> 01:26:55.449
What is happening?

01:26:55.451 --> 01:26:57.385
All right, everybody whose
last name isn't O'Callaghan,

01:26:57.387 --> 01:26:58.719
get in the house.

01:26:58.721 --> 01:27:00.790
- Oh, God.
- Come on, move.

01:27:01.923 --> 01:27:03.125
Oh, God!

01:27:03.959 --> 01:27:06.128
Oh, fuck!

01:27:08.397 --> 01:27:10.398
<i>All right, settle in.</i>

01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:11.899
I'll try to clear
this up for you.

01:27:11.901 --> 01:27:12.832
Good.

01:27:12.834 --> 01:27:14.868
Paddy could not
be their father.

01:27:14.870 --> 01:27:16.703
How do you know that, Kevin?

01:27:16.705 --> 01:27:18.806
Because Paddy and their mother
never had sex.

01:27:18.808 --> 01:27:20.574
What?

01:27:20.576 --> 01:27:22.743
I mean, you can't
know that for sure.

01:27:22.745 --> 01:27:25.046
Paddy thought he was
gonna marry your mother.

01:27:25.048 --> 01:27:27.081
And despite
the sexual climate,

01:27:27.083 --> 01:27:30.184
for him, that meant saving it
for their wedding night.

01:27:30.186 --> 01:27:32.051
Yeah, like Sarah's
saving her muff.

01:27:32.053 --> 01:27:34.388
Shut the fuck up, Liam.
You're no angel.

01:27:34.390 --> 01:27:35.755
Shut up, you two.

01:27:35.757 --> 01:27:39.026
My brother Paddy
took this very seriously.

01:27:39.028 --> 01:27:41.464
If you don't believe me,
ask your mother.

01:27:42.198 --> 01:27:43.330
Not now,

01:27:43.332 --> 01:27:44.532
you moron!

01:27:44.534 --> 01:27:45.966
You said go ask Ma.

01:27:45.968 --> 01:27:46.834
Sit down.

01:27:46.836 --> 01:27:48.771
Jesus Christ! Sit down.

01:27:49.338 --> 01:27:51.337
So what happened?

01:27:51.339 --> 01:27:52.607
Well, what happened was,

01:27:52.609 --> 01:27:54.608
a guy by the name
of Walter Tinkler.

01:27:54.610 --> 01:27:56.876
A veterinarian student
from down in New York.

01:27:56.878 --> 01:27:58.679
Dr. Tinkler? We know him!

01:27:58.681 --> 01:28:00.648
The guy who killed
Chairman Meow.

01:28:00.650 --> 01:28:02.315
<i>He didn't
kill Chairman Meow.</i>

01:28:02.317 --> 01:28:05.685
Well, was Chairman Meow alive
when we dropped him off?

01:28:05.687 --> 01:28:07.621
Was he dead
when we picked him up?

01:28:07.623 --> 01:28:09.357
In my book, that's murder.

01:28:09.359 --> 01:28:10.794
<i>Hey. Hey.</i>

01:28:11.627 --> 01:28:13.627
It was just a fuckin' cat.

01:28:13.629 --> 01:28:17.998
We both loved Chairman Meow.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:22.001
I can't believe Tinkler's been
in our lives this whole time.

01:28:22.003 --> 01:28:24.203
You see, this Tinkler guy
and your mother

01:28:24.205 --> 01:28:26.540
had this on-again
off-again relationship

01:28:26.542 --> 01:28:28.375
apparently since high school.

01:28:28.377 --> 01:28:29.843
<i>Paddy was always worried</i>

01:28:29.845 --> 01:28:32.179
<i>that she'd wind up
going back to him.</i>

01:28:32.181 --> 01:28:35.014
Ultimately, she did.

01:28:35.016 --> 01:28:36.916
But she did tell my brother
she'd always have

01:28:36.918 --> 01:28:39.153
a warm spot
in the heart for him.

01:28:39.155 --> 01:28:40.921
She let him down soft.

01:28:40.923 --> 01:28:44.024
But this Tinkler guy
was the love of her life,

01:28:44.026 --> 01:28:46.027
and that she was
going to marry him.

01:28:46.029 --> 01:28:48.496
Mom got married?

01:28:48.498 --> 01:28:49.696
To Tinkler?

01:28:49.698 --> 01:28:51.197
<i>Last I heard,</i>

01:28:51.199 --> 01:28:53.968
she had twins and moved back
to Ohio to raise 'em.

01:28:53.970 --> 01:28:55.202
What?

01:28:55.204 --> 01:28:57.671
So, if their mom hadn't broken
our dad's heart,

01:28:57.673 --> 01:28:59.709
then the three of us

01:29:00.342 --> 01:29:01.809
never been born?

01:29:01.811 --> 01:29:04.047
That's one way
of looking at it.

01:29:04.680 --> 01:29:06.583
Sorry, fellas,

01:29:07.182 --> 01:29:08.618
you made me.

01:29:10.253 --> 01:29:11.688
You gave me life.

01:29:13.955 --> 01:29:17.192
That's not good logic.

01:29:18.628 --> 01:29:22.595
That's all I got.
I'm stuck with this.

01:29:22.597 --> 01:29:23.930
Enjoy your fuckin' life.

01:29:23.932 --> 01:29:25.768
Thanks, Uncle Kevin.

01:29:28.238 --> 01:29:29.804
And you two

01:29:29.806 --> 01:29:32.473
are off the hook. Officially.

01:29:32.475 --> 01:29:33.806
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:29:33.808 --> 01:29:35.209
You were sweatin' it there
for a second.

01:29:35.211 --> 01:29:36.743
- Yeah.
- I was, too. I know I said

01:29:36.745 --> 01:29:38.479
it wasn't a big deal
effing your sister.

01:29:38.481 --> 01:29:39.813
It's a big deal.

01:29:39.815 --> 01:29:42.015
- It's a big deal.
<i>- It's criminal.</i>

01:29:42.017 --> 01:29:43.720
Oh, my God.

01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:45.853
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

01:29:45.855 --> 01:29:48.158
Looks like we're going home.

01:30:08.276 --> 01:30:09.678
What was that?

01:30:10.945 --> 01:30:13.480
You honked.

01:30:13.482 --> 01:30:14.883
You asshole.

01:30:27.430 --> 01:30:29.633
- Hello!
- Hello!

01:30:30.565 --> 01:30:32.134
I just did...

01:30:32.701 --> 01:30:33.901
Hello?

01:30:33.903 --> 01:30:35.669
Yup. Heard you the first time.

01:30:35.671 --> 01:30:37.238
<i>Sorry.</i>

01:30:37.240 --> 01:30:38.238
How can I help you?

01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:40.174
We really need to
see Dr. Tinkler.

01:30:40.176 --> 01:30:42.242
- Kind of a family emergency.
- Yeah.

01:30:42.244 --> 01:30:43.676
Well, I'm sorry.
He's with a patient

01:30:43.678 --> 01:30:45.580
and doesn't
want to be disturbed.

01:30:45.582 --> 01:30:46.746
Well, I'm sorry.
We didn't want to

01:30:46.748 --> 01:30:48.148
grow up without a father.

01:30:48.150 --> 01:30:49.049
Yeah.

01:30:49.051 --> 01:30:50.350
Could you please disturb him?

01:30:50.352 --> 01:30:53.319
Okay, I can't really
speak to your experience.

01:30:53.321 --> 01:30:55.723
Although, I did get kicked out
of a threesome in college

01:30:55.725 --> 01:30:57.058
and that was very traumatic.

01:30:57.060 --> 01:30:59.027
- No.
- Yeah.

01:30:59.029 --> 01:31:00.961
- They just kicked you out?
- Yes.

01:31:00.963 --> 01:31:02.263
They went like this...

01:31:03.732 --> 01:31:05.532
In flagrante
and then you're gone?

01:31:05.534 --> 01:31:06.600
They said I was
underperforming.

01:31:06.602 --> 01:31:07.801
I thought I was doing great.

01:31:07.803 --> 01:31:09.803
Can we just stay focused here?

01:31:09.805 --> 01:31:11.171
This is super important.

01:31:11.173 --> 01:31:14.440
We have to see
the doctor stat,

01:31:14.442 --> 01:31:15.742
which is a medical term.

01:31:15.744 --> 01:31:17.845
Okay,
he has an opening...

01:31:17.847 --> 01:31:18.979
Ooh! Thursday.

01:31:18.981 --> 01:31:20.480
I'll pencil you in.

01:31:20.482 --> 01:31:21.915
- No!
- Now!

01:31:21.917 --> 01:31:24.151
- Pencil us in now!
- Right now! This is urgent.

01:31:24.153 --> 01:31:25.219
Please!

01:31:25.221 --> 01:31:27.188
Ali, could you bring me
Butterball's

01:31:27.190 --> 01:31:29.157
immunization records, please?

01:31:29.159 --> 01:31:30.224
Hello.

01:31:35.664 --> 01:31:37.066
Peter.

01:31:38.767 --> 01:31:40.203
Kyle.

01:31:41.270 --> 01:31:42.439
Walter.

01:31:43.338 --> 01:31:44.707
Dad.

01:31:48.076 --> 01:31:49.876
- What the... Come on.
- Get him.

01:31:49.878 --> 01:31:51.912
You gotta get down here
right away. They're here.

01:31:51.914 --> 01:31:53.947
Walter, what are you doing?
We're your sons.

01:31:53.949 --> 01:31:55.448
Well,
you gotta get down here.

01:31:55.450 --> 01:31:56.684
Walter is your father?

01:31:56.686 --> 01:31:58.417
You said
you never wanted children!

01:31:58.419 --> 01:32:00.755
I didn't. I don't.
Ali, it's complicated.

01:32:00.757 --> 01:32:02.288
You know what's complicated?

01:32:02.290 --> 01:32:03.523
Dating a man who went to
high school with my mother.

01:32:03.525 --> 01:32:04.891
You should just open the door.

01:32:04.893 --> 01:32:06.460
Second door, sucker.

01:32:06.462 --> 01:32:07.760
<i>Pete, I'm in.</i>

01:32:07.762 --> 01:32:08.929
Now you're gonna talk.

01:32:08.931 --> 01:32:10.730
Kyle, please. Guys, calm down.

01:32:10.732 --> 01:32:12.032
Your mother, I think,

01:32:12.034 --> 01:32:13.501
really should
have this conversation.

01:32:13.503 --> 01:32:16.269
Well, that hasn't worked
for the last 40 years.

01:32:16.271 --> 01:32:18.705
Look. We're not trying
to shake you down,

01:32:18.707 --> 01:32:20.176
Dad, we just wanna...

01:32:23.044 --> 01:32:24.912
You sick son of a bitch.

01:32:24.914 --> 01:32:27.147
Is this how you butchered
Chairman Meow?

01:32:27.149 --> 01:32:28.948
Nobody butchered
Chairman Meow.

01:32:28.950 --> 01:32:30.818
It's called putting him down.

01:32:30.820 --> 01:32:32.420
It's called death.

01:32:32.422 --> 01:32:34.354
Death. Yes.

01:32:34.356 --> 01:32:36.890
It comes to us all.
Even the kitties.

01:32:36.892 --> 01:32:38.591
Enough, all right.

01:32:38.593 --> 01:32:42.662
We know you're our father.
Why can't you just say it?

01:32:42.664 --> 01:32:44.464
We just want some answers.

01:32:44.466 --> 01:32:45.666
Ooh. Looky here.

01:32:45.668 --> 01:32:46.934
Is this what you do?

01:32:46.936 --> 01:32:48.868
You just shoot the cats
in the head?

01:32:48.870 --> 01:32:51.805
It's a tranquilizer gun.
Every vet has one.

01:32:51.807 --> 01:32:53.073
Not on my watch.

01:32:53.075 --> 01:32:54.341
<i>You're not going
to put him down.</i>

01:32:54.343 --> 01:32:56.477
- This has to stop.
- We're just snipping him.

01:32:56.479 --> 01:32:58.047
This cat lives...

01:33:00.716 --> 01:33:02.014
Pete, you gotta see this.

01:33:02.016 --> 01:33:03.718
Kyle, stay focused.

01:33:03.720 --> 01:33:05.488
Oh, my God. Those are huge.

01:33:06.454 --> 01:33:08.455
<i>Those are big balls.</i>

01:33:08.457 --> 01:33:09.489
Unnerving.

01:33:09.491 --> 01:33:11.190
Gotta tip your hat
to the little guy.

01:33:11.192 --> 01:33:12.993
You're a doctor,
is that normal?

01:33:12.995 --> 01:33:16.395
No. Yeah. But for a gorilla.

01:33:16.397 --> 01:33:18.931
<i>That's beautiful.
Well done.</i>

01:33:18.933 --> 01:33:20.666
Wow! That's...

01:33:20.668 --> 01:33:21.870
He's gone!

01:33:22.838 --> 01:33:24.274
We got a runner!

01:33:25.341 --> 01:33:26.974
Run, Walter, run!

01:33:26.976 --> 01:33:29.843
Where are you going?
We know where you live.

01:33:32.147 --> 01:33:34.480
Whoa! You shot Dad.

01:33:34.482 --> 01:33:36.820
Because this ends now.

01:33:42.024 --> 01:33:44.058
Walter!

01:33:44.060 --> 01:33:45.626
Is he all right?
Pete, you're a doctor, look.

01:33:45.628 --> 01:33:47.728
- I know. I think he's okay.
- Sweetheart, come through.

01:33:47.730 --> 01:33:49.062
Give him some water.

01:33:49.064 --> 01:33:50.229
Yeah, it's gonna
be okay. Right?

01:33:50.231 --> 01:33:51.698
Give me your eyes.
It's me, Kyle.

01:33:51.700 --> 01:33:53.099
Why did you run?

01:33:53.101 --> 01:33:54.702
You see how it feels?
It doesn't feel good.

01:33:54.704 --> 01:33:55.970
Hey, come on.

01:33:55.972 --> 01:33:57.837
What the fuck
did you do to Walter?

01:33:57.839 --> 01:33:59.038
Mom, what are you doing here?

01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:00.942
Yeah, what are you doing here?

01:34:00.944 --> 01:34:02.641
You just called me!
Are you kidding?

01:34:02.643 --> 01:34:04.277
I'm sorry. I got shot

01:34:04.279 --> 01:34:07.715
by a tranquilizer dart
and I'm a little woozy.

01:34:07.717 --> 01:34:09.382
It was a whole...

01:34:09.384 --> 01:34:11.618
We shot him because
he was trying to escape.

01:34:11.620 --> 01:34:12.987
<i>What the hell, Mom?</i>

01:34:12.989 --> 01:34:14.988
I mean, our Dad was here
the whole time,

01:34:14.990 --> 01:34:16.790
you sent us on
this wild-goose chase.

01:34:16.792 --> 01:34:18.257
Okay. This family has issues.

01:34:18.259 --> 01:34:20.094
I didn't think you'd go, okay?

01:34:20.096 --> 01:34:22.229
Although, I thought
it might be a nice idea

01:34:22.231 --> 01:34:24.130
for you guys to go on
a road trip together

01:34:24.132 --> 01:34:25.898
since you can't stay
in the same room

01:34:25.900 --> 01:34:27.535
together for two minutes.

01:34:27.537 --> 01:34:29.236
We can and we did.

01:34:29.238 --> 01:34:31.138
Yeah, we drove halfway
around the country

01:34:31.140 --> 01:34:33.974
looking for a guy
who lives next door to us.

01:34:33.976 --> 01:34:35.742
By the way,
kind of a bumpy ride.

01:34:35.744 --> 01:34:37.144
He didn't live next door.

01:34:37.146 --> 01:34:38.379
He actually lived
three or four houses down.

01:34:38.381 --> 01:34:39.647
No, it's definitely
our street.

01:34:39.649 --> 01:34:40.947
Over. But I know
what you mean.

01:34:40.949 --> 01:34:41.782
No, it wasn't.
It was the next street.

01:34:41.784 --> 01:34:42.849
It was.

01:34:42.851 --> 01:34:43.983
Stop it!

01:34:43.985 --> 01:34:45.352
Stop it!

01:34:45.354 --> 01:34:48.020
Just take a big
deep breath, okay?

01:34:48.022 --> 01:34:50.125
Please. Sit down.

01:34:50.592 --> 01:34:51.961
Sit down.

01:34:53.796 --> 01:34:56.132
There's something
I have to say.

01:35:00.369 --> 01:35:02.438
It was, um...

01:35:05.341 --> 01:35:11.010
Okay. It was December 1975,
three days before Christmas.

01:35:11.012 --> 01:35:13.313
That's... That's our birthday.

01:35:13.315 --> 01:35:14.482
Yeah.

01:35:14.484 --> 01:35:16.250
<i>I was doing
community outreach,</i>

01:35:16.252 --> 01:35:21.421
working with women who were
in pretty bad situations.

01:35:21.423 --> 01:35:23.890
What kind of bad situations?

01:35:23.892 --> 01:35:25.091
Really bad, Kyle.

01:35:25.093 --> 01:35:26.460
Drugs,

01:35:26.462 --> 01:35:27.560
abuse,

01:35:27.562 --> 01:35:29.229
destructive
May-December relationships

01:35:29.231 --> 01:35:30.730
they can't pry themselves
away from?

01:35:30.732 --> 01:35:34.033
Ali, don't bring your
own drum to the concert.

01:35:34.035 --> 01:35:35.935
Let Helen talk.

01:35:37.472 --> 01:35:39.973
There was one
young girl in particular

01:35:39.975 --> 01:35:41.875
that I got very close to.

01:35:41.877 --> 01:35:46.680
There was something
incredibly special about her.

01:35:46.682 --> 01:35:49.282
She was six months pregnant.

01:35:49.284 --> 01:35:52.085
She went into labor early.

01:35:52.087 --> 01:35:54.388
It was dangerously early.

01:35:54.390 --> 01:36:00.760
And she had a very, very long
and hard delivery.

01:36:00.762 --> 01:36:03.331
But, at the end,

01:36:03.333 --> 01:36:09.405
she produced two
beautiful baby boys.

01:36:15.278 --> 01:36:17.180
Your birth mother.

01:36:24.119 --> 01:36:25.721
Your mother

01:36:27.955 --> 01:36:29.624
didn't survive.

01:36:36.365 --> 01:36:38.998
Oh, my God.
This just got really sad.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:40.667
So, with no family on record,

01:36:40.669 --> 01:36:43.403
the hospital was required
to call social services.

01:36:43.405 --> 01:36:46.372
But Helen didn't want to
put you into that system

01:36:46.374 --> 01:36:47.741
and maybe get split up.

01:36:47.743 --> 01:36:51.614
She loved you from
the moment she saw you.

01:36:52.948 --> 01:36:56.081
So, I started
the process of adoption.

01:36:56.083 --> 01:36:58.117
<i>Despite my objections.</i>

01:36:58.119 --> 01:36:59.987
See, as much as I loved Helen,

01:36:59.989 --> 01:37:01.621
I couldn't imagine sacrificing

01:37:01.623 --> 01:37:04.524
my future for two tiny
strangers. You know?

01:37:04.526 --> 01:37:08.528
Kids were
never part of my plan.

01:37:08.530 --> 01:37:10.864
I'm better with animals,
I guess.

01:37:10.866 --> 01:37:15.602
<i>Helen, on the other hand,
could imagine nothing else.</i>

01:37:15.604 --> 01:37:21.043
And I brought you here
to Westerville to raise you.

01:37:37.192 --> 01:37:39.593
What was her name?

01:37:39.595 --> 01:37:41.364
Our birth mother.

01:37:42.998 --> 01:37:44.599
Jenny.

01:37:48.236 --> 01:37:49.638
Jenny who?

01:37:50.271 --> 01:37:52.672
<i>I don't know.</i>

01:37:52.674 --> 01:37:55.108
The reason why young girls
came to us

01:37:55.110 --> 01:37:58.778
was because
we didn't ask questions.

01:37:58.780 --> 01:38:02.748
<i>We weren't certain
that that was her real name.</i>

01:38:02.750 --> 01:38:04.619
What about our dad?

01:38:06.288 --> 01:38:08.221
We never knew.

01:38:08.223 --> 01:38:10.956
She wouldn't talk about it.

01:38:10.958 --> 01:38:16.198
She just wanted to start a
new life for the three of you.

01:38:38.454 --> 01:38:40.756
I need to get some air.

01:38:46.528 --> 01:38:48.597
- I'll talk to him.
- Yeah.

01:38:56.137 --> 01:38:57.372
Hey.

01:38:58.207 --> 01:38:59.508
Talk to me.

01:39:01.208 --> 01:39:03.943
What's going through
your head?

01:39:03.945 --> 01:39:06.912
Biological mother
dies at childbirth?

01:39:06.914 --> 01:39:09.215
Which I guess is another way
of saying we killed her.

01:39:09.217 --> 01:39:10.716
No.

01:39:10.718 --> 01:39:12.185
At a certain point, I just
gotta say, you're right.

01:39:12.187 --> 01:39:13.921
The universe is an asshole.

01:39:13.923 --> 01:39:16.255
I think we're
a couple of born losers

01:39:16.257 --> 01:39:19.492
fulfilling our
born loser identity.

01:39:19.494 --> 01:39:22.562
I mean, you don't think
that's an asshole move?

01:39:22.564 --> 01:39:24.901
Fuck the universe!

01:39:25.833 --> 01:39:27.067
What do you call that?

01:39:27.069 --> 01:39:30.136
I'll grant you,
the universe is a little wily,

01:39:30.138 --> 01:39:32.672
a little unpredictable.

01:39:32.674 --> 01:39:34.774
But it's pretty
fucking amazing

01:39:34.776 --> 01:39:38.381
when you consider
it also gave us Mom.

01:39:39.815 --> 01:39:44.553
And Mom gave up
everything for us.

01:39:45.721 --> 01:39:48.755
Where would we be
right now without Mom?

01:39:48.757 --> 01:39:52.358
And I hate to even
contemplate this.

01:39:52.360 --> 01:39:55.665
We might be
running around out there,

01:39:57.232 --> 01:40:01.937
not even aware
that each other exists.

01:40:06.307 --> 01:40:07.873
<i>We're not losers.</i>

01:40:07.875 --> 01:40:11.077
We're survivors. Okay?

01:40:11.079 --> 01:40:13.749
And that's because of Mom.

01:40:15.383 --> 01:40:16.882
And because of Mom,

01:40:16.884 --> 01:40:19.989
we can survive anything
the universe throws at us.

01:40:22.158 --> 01:40:23.625
I like that.

01:40:24.392 --> 01:40:26.660
All right. Good.

01:40:26.662 --> 01:40:28.297
Survivors.

01:40:29.365 --> 01:40:30.730
That's good.

01:40:30.732 --> 01:40:34.902
But the universe is on
probation with me, Pete.

01:40:34.904 --> 01:40:36.606
Fair enough.

01:40:45.914 --> 01:40:49.916
I should've told you as soon
as you could understand,

01:40:49.918 --> 01:40:52.885
but I didn't,

01:40:52.887 --> 01:40:57.056
and it just got
harder and harder.

01:40:57.058 --> 01:40:58.828
I was so afraid.

01:40:59.293 --> 01:41:00.562
Of what?

01:41:01.363 --> 01:41:03.598
Of hurting you.

01:41:05.801 --> 01:41:07.303
Losing you.

01:41:11.006 --> 01:41:13.872
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:41:13.874 --> 01:41:14.944
No.

01:41:29.423 --> 01:41:30.692
So...

01:41:32.694 --> 01:41:34.394
I got hit by a train.

01:41:34.396 --> 01:41:37.066
You got hit by a train.

01:41:40.168 --> 01:41:41.600
I'm gonna miss you.

01:41:41.602 --> 01:41:43.605
I'm gonna miss you.

01:41:44.839 --> 01:41:49.576
Well, you get after that
fantastic girl of yours

01:41:49.578 --> 01:41:51.345
and give her <i>Honi</i> for me.

01:41:51.347 --> 01:41:53.147
Fuck that!
I'm gonna give you a <i>Honi.</i>

01:41:53.149 --> 01:41:54.514
I don't need a <i>Honi.</i> I'm good.

01:41:54.516 --> 01:41:55.448
You do need a <i>Honi.</i>
We all need <i>Honis.</i>

01:41:55.450 --> 01:41:57.084
- Hey...
- Peter.

01:41:57.086 --> 01:41:59.353
- I'm giving you a <i>Honi.</i>
- All right.

01:41:59.355 --> 01:42:01.057
You know what they say,

01:42:01.990 --> 01:42:03.355
a <i>Honi</i> a day...

01:42:30.918 --> 01:42:32.185
<i>Blue, 32!</i>

01:42:32.187 --> 01:42:33.756
Hut! Hut!

01:42:35.024 --> 01:42:36.124
In the end zone.

01:42:37.558 --> 01:42:40.059
Yeah! It's a catch!

01:42:40.061 --> 01:42:41.094
<i>Great throw, Dad.</i>

01:42:41.096 --> 01:42:43.063
Damn, you could've
been in the NFL.

01:42:43.065 --> 01:42:44.997
- Eh. Probably.
- Hey, you ready for this?

01:42:44.999 --> 01:42:47.369
Probably could've been.
Yeah. Hit me. Hit me.

01:42:50.905 --> 01:42:52.572
Oh, shit!

01:42:52.574 --> 01:42:54.474
Boom! You like that?

01:42:54.476 --> 01:42:56.579
Oh, my God. Nice hit.

01:42:57.745 --> 01:42:59.114
Come here, you.

01:43:00.615 --> 01:43:02.215
Oh, gross, guys.

01:43:02.217 --> 01:43:03.718
Come on. Really?

01:43:07.321 --> 01:43:09.422
Life is such a crazy ride.

01:43:09.424 --> 01:43:13.225
One minute you're on this epic
quest with your brother.

01:43:13.227 --> 01:43:16.696
The next minute you're getting
replaced by a monkey,

01:43:16.698 --> 01:43:17.864
<i>about to lose it all.</i>

01:43:17.866 --> 01:43:19.132
<i>And the next minute,</i>

01:43:19.134 --> 01:43:21.166
you think
your brother's been killed

01:43:21.168 --> 01:43:22.736
by a speeding locomotive.

01:43:22.738 --> 01:43:24.537
And the next minute you think

01:43:24.539 --> 01:43:27.107
your brother's having sex
with his sister.

01:43:27.109 --> 01:43:29.343
But the next minute
you're very happy

01:43:29.345 --> 01:43:31.243
to find out that
she can't be your sister

01:43:31.245 --> 01:43:34.581
because her father didn't
believe in premarital sex.

01:43:34.583 --> 01:43:35.881
I'm not sure
they're quite ready

01:43:35.883 --> 01:43:37.783
to hear about
all your adventures.

01:43:37.785 --> 01:43:39.285
You're gonna have to
educate those girls

01:43:39.287 --> 01:43:40.653
about premarital sex

01:43:40.655 --> 01:43:42.922
because we come from
a long line of people

01:43:42.924 --> 01:43:45.157
with a zest for love making.

01:43:45.159 --> 01:43:47.327
Never hold back on love.

01:43:47.329 --> 01:43:49.129
<i>You hear that? Never.</i>

01:43:49.131 --> 01:43:51.297
But let's not get distracted.
Now, where were we?

01:43:51.299 --> 01:43:54.867
Yes, one minute, Dad's getting
replaced by a monkey...

01:43:54.869 --> 01:43:56.769
<i>Yeah,
but the next minute,</i>

01:43:56.771 --> 01:43:58.871
you're inventing an app
with your brother

01:43:58.873 --> 01:44:02.675
that sends people optimistic
messages from the universe.

01:44:02.677 --> 01:44:05.245
And then the next minute,
you're making $3.99

01:44:05.247 --> 01:44:08.148
- every time it's downloaded.
- Every single time.

01:44:08.150 --> 01:44:09.215
And the next minute,

01:44:09.217 --> 01:44:10.750
it's been downloaded
a million times.

01:44:10.752 --> 01:44:12.521
A million times.

01:44:14.522 --> 01:44:17.357
<i>Hi, it's me. The Universe.</i>

01:44:17.359 --> 01:44:20.559
<i>Remember, life is not a race.</i>

01:44:20.561 --> 01:44:22.996
<i>It's the journey that counts.</i>

01:44:22.998 --> 01:44:24.098
<i>Okay?</i>

01:44:24.699 --> 01:44:26.034
<i>I love you.</i>

01:44:27.903 --> 01:44:30.606
<i>By the way,
the Illuminati is real.</i>
