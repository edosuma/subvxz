Gosh, some of this stuff

00:34.576 --> 00:36.537
you wonder who would
ever need it in bulk.

00:36.620 --> 00:37.704
I mean, like watermelons.

00:40.874 --> 00:43.043
Touché, CostMart.

00:43.168 --> 00:44.336
Brian, will you watch Stewie
for a minute?

00:44.419 --> 00:45.420
Sure.

00:45.504 --> 00:47.047
And please a close eye on him.

00:47.130 --> 00:48.924
Remember what happened
last time.

00:50.300 --> 00:52.219
Stewie, get down
before you hurt yourself.

00:52.302 --> 00:54.972
Shut up. You're not my mother!

00:55.055 --> 00:56.473
Good God,
are you all right?

00:56.557 --> 00:57.558
Fine. Why do you ask?

00:59.518 --> 01:00.978
Mmm, delicious.

01:01.061 --> 01:05.274
I will seriously consider
purchasing this product.

01:06.817 --> 01:09.027
Oh, what have we here?

01:09.194 --> 01:10.445
May I partake?

01:10.529 --> 01:11.947
Mmm...

01:14.032 --> 01:15.784
( Asian accent ):
Ah, sausage-san.

01:15.909 --> 01:18.161
Plan to buy great amount
for samurai buddies.

01:18.287 --> 01:20.706
Sir, you don't have to keep
moving to the back of the line.

01:20.789 --> 01:22.833
You can have as many
as you want; they're free.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.084
What are you
talking about?

01:24.168 --> 01:25.294
Hey, can I have
some more sausage?

01:25.377 --> 01:26.378
Yeah, me, too.

01:26.461 --> 01:28.672
Oh, they got a great deal
on pianos

01:28.755 --> 01:30.048
if you buy a four-pack.

01:30.132 --> 01:31.675
Meg, help me get these down.

01:31.800 --> 01:32.843
MAN:
Lois?

01:32.926 --> 01:33.927
Oh, my God.

01:34.094 --> 01:35.095
( Meg screams )

01:35.179 --> 01:36.263
I don't believe this.

01:36.346 --> 01:38.223
Ross Fishman,
is that really you?

01:38.307 --> 01:40.100
I haven't seen you
since college.

01:40.225 --> 01:41.226
How are you?

01:41.310 --> 01:42.311
Great, great.

01:42.394 --> 01:44.730
Wow, Lois, you
haven't aged a bit.

01:44.813 --> 01:45.981
( chuckling ):
Oh...

01:46.064 --> 01:47.399
Mm, thank you.

01:47.482 --> 01:50.777
This 12-pack of fungicide
is for my daughter, Meg.

01:50.861 --> 01:52.070
( clears throat )

01:52.154 --> 01:54.281
Help... me.

01:56.408 --> 01:57.409
( shoppers laugh )

01:57.492 --> 01:58.869
He's funny.
That was great.

01:58.952 --> 01:59.995
Is it 1981?

02:00.078 --> 02:01.246
( inhales deeply )

02:01.330 --> 02:03.248
Ah, yes, there you are.

02:03.332 --> 02:05.709
You people at the Industrial
Adhesives Corporation

02:05.792 --> 02:07.753
certainly know how
to make a tasty glue.

02:07.836 --> 02:09.379
Now, then,
let the banquet begin.

02:09.463 --> 02:11.465
Whoa, whoa. What the
hell are you doing?

02:11.548 --> 02:12.674
Don't eat that.

02:12.758 --> 02:14.426
Oh, for God's sake,
don't be such a nerd.

02:14.510 --> 02:16.470
Look, I'm supposed to
keep an eye on you.

02:16.553 --> 02:18.096
If Lois sees this,
she'll kill me.

02:18.180 --> 02:19.681
You can let go
of my hand now.

02:19.765 --> 02:20.766
You can let go of mine.

02:23.268 --> 02:25.270
( grunting and groaning )

02:25.437 --> 02:27.940
( yelling )

02:28.023 --> 02:30.526
( breathing heavily )

02:33.779 --> 02:34.780
Oh...

02:34.863 --> 02:35.864
Crap.

02:35.948 --> 02:37.366
Well, Ross,I
can't tell you

02:37.449 --> 02:39.076
how wonderful it's
been to see you.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.744
It's a crime that
it's been so long.

02:40.827 --> 02:42.538
We were so close.

02:42.621 --> 02:44.831
Maybe we could get together
for a cup of coffee. Catch up.

02:44.915 --> 02:47.125
Well... I don't know, Ross.

02:47.209 --> 02:48.585
I'm married now.

02:48.669 --> 02:49.711
( chuckles )

02:49.795 --> 02:50.796
Well, so am I.

02:50.879 --> 02:52.130
Does that mean
we're not allowed

02:52.214 --> 02:53.215
to stay in touch
with old friends?

02:53.298 --> 02:54.424
Tell you what.

02:54.508 --> 02:56.885
If you change your mind,
here's my card.

02:57.886 --> 03:00.430
Hey, look, Dad, they have
12-packs of kidneys.

03:00.514 --> 03:02.516
Yeah, but you got to buy
the cooler, too.

03:02.599 --> 03:03.809
That's how
they get you.

03:06.103 --> 03:07.437
Okay, thanks.

03:07.521 --> 03:08.689
Well?

03:08.897 --> 03:09.898
Well, the good news is

03:09.982 --> 03:11.233
the same company
makes a solvent

03:11.316 --> 03:12.901
that'll get us unstuck.

03:12.985 --> 03:14.570
The bad news is,
it takes two weeks for delivery.

03:14.653 --> 03:16.697
You're telling me
that we're stuck like this

03:16.780 --> 03:17.906
for a bloody fortnight?

03:17.990 --> 03:19.700
You cannot tell Lois about this.

03:19.783 --> 03:20.951
Oh? And what if I do?

03:21.034 --> 03:22.411
I'll show her those
pictures of you

03:22.494 --> 03:23.787
wearing her wedding dress.

03:23.871 --> 03:25.914
You said there was no film
in that camera.

03:25.998 --> 03:28.208
Come on, Stewie, it's time
to change your diaper.

03:28.292 --> 03:29.918
Uh, mind if I watch?

03:31.253 --> 03:32.921
And I'm just ashamed
of myself, Brian

03:33.005 --> 03:34.381
that I let Peter's jealousy

03:34.464 --> 03:36.592
prevent me from rekindling
an old friendship

03:36.675 --> 03:38.218
just because
it was with a man.

03:38.302 --> 03:40.679
Yeah, Peter's not exactly
the most understanding guy

03:40.762 --> 03:42.306
when it comes to
you and other men.

03:42.389 --> 03:43.765
Like that time
at the movies...

03:47.186 --> 03:48.979
Uh, I-I-I... this is...

03:49.062 --> 03:51.273
this is terribly awkward

03:51.356 --> 03:54.067
but I-I-I-I wanted
to tell you something

03:54.151 --> 03:57.738
but I-I... oh, I seem to be
so charmingly befuddled.

03:57.821 --> 04:00.157
Ah, that Hugh Grant
is so handsome.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.075
Oh, is that how it is?

04:02.159 --> 04:03.660
Come here
you home-wrecking bastard!

04:03.744 --> 04:04.745
( grunting )

04:04.912 --> 04:06.413
Don't do it, Dad.

04:06.496 --> 04:07.831
He's bigger than you.

04:07.915 --> 04:08.999
And when you went
to that concert.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.668
Thank you. Thank you very much.

04:12.002 --> 04:13.003
This next one

04:13.086 --> 04:14.963
is for all the ladies out there.

04:18.926 --> 04:20.677
And then there was
last Saturday night.

04:20.886 --> 04:23.889
Oh, look at
that handsome man.

04:24.056 --> 04:26.308
You son of a bitch!

04:26.391 --> 04:28.685
I can't let Peter's
irrational emotions run my life.

04:28.769 --> 04:30.437
I'm going to call Ross

04:30.521 --> 04:32.773
and see if it's not too late
to take him up on his offer.

04:32.856 --> 04:33.941
Would you mind
finishing up?

04:34.024 --> 04:35.275
Uh, sure.

04:35.359 --> 04:38.403
Yes, yes, do you like
cleaning my doodie, Brian?

04:38.487 --> 04:41.949
Say it. Say, "I like
cleaning your doodie, Stewie."

04:42.074 --> 04:43.450
Ha! Don't forget the 'taint.

04:44.660 --> 04:48.705
( theme music playing )

04:48.872 --> 04:50.707
T.C., you fly the chopper
around the island.

04:50.791 --> 04:52.626
I'll go talk
to the beautiful women

04:52.709 --> 04:55.087
and Tattoo here will keep
an eye out for the kidnappers.

04:55.170 --> 04:56.380
Higgins.

04:56.505 --> 04:57.798
We'll need to have security

04:57.881 --> 04:59.508
unlock the gate for me
out front. Okay, Tattoo?

04:59.591 --> 05:01.176
It's Higgins.

05:01.260 --> 05:02.302
What?

05:02.386 --> 05:04.054
The-the name is Higgins.

05:05.681 --> 05:06.890
What's your name?

05:06.974 --> 05:08.433
It's Tattoo.

05:08.517 --> 05:10.352
Oh, um, Peter

05:10.435 --> 05:14.189
I'm just, uh... going to go
out for a few hours.

05:14.273 --> 05:17.734
Uh... so, I... I'll return
in a few hours.

05:17.818 --> 05:20.112
Yeah, I'll do it
when this is over.

05:20.195 --> 05:22.739
Hey, Lois, could you
grab me a beer?

05:22.823 --> 05:23.824
Lois?

05:23.907 --> 05:25.033
Dad, I think she went out.

05:25.117 --> 05:26.326
All right, then
you be Lois.

05:26.410 --> 05:27.578
Okay.

05:27.661 --> 05:28.704
Hey, Lois, could
you grab me a beer?

05:28.787 --> 05:30.664
Oh, my God, you've
really let yourself go.

05:30.747 --> 05:32.249
Well, maybe if
you bought me

05:32.332 --> 05:34.251
some nice clothes
once in a while.

05:34.877 --> 05:37.462
( over loudspeaker ): Peter Griffin,
we know you're in there.

05:37.546 --> 05:38.755
Come out with your hands up.

05:40.132 --> 05:41.341
Fooled you.

05:41.425 --> 05:42.634
( laughing )

05:42.718 --> 05:44.720
Yeah, you sure did.

05:44.803 --> 05:46.013
What the hell is this?

05:46.096 --> 05:47.431
It's the new police
surveillance van.

05:47.514 --> 05:48.557
We're going
on a beer run.

05:48.640 --> 05:49.683
Want to join us?

05:49.766 --> 05:50.767
No. I quit drinking.

05:50.851 --> 05:51.977
I think I might be an alcoholic.

05:52.060 --> 05:53.729
-What?! Aw, man.
-Oh, my God!

05:53.812 --> 05:54.897
( laughs )

05:54.980 --> 05:56.023
Fooled you.

05:56.106 --> 05:57.191
Come on, let's go drink

05:57.274 --> 05:58.984
till we can't
feel feelings anymore.

05:59.067 --> 06:01.820
This van has the latest in
law enforcement technology.

06:01.945 --> 06:03.238
Watch.

06:03.322 --> 06:05.240
( mechanical voice ):
Suspect! Suspect!

06:05.324 --> 06:07.284
You have the right
to remain silent.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.535
Ah, sweet.

06:08.619 --> 06:09.661
Hey, let me try.

06:09.745 --> 06:10.746
Cleveland, don't!

06:10.829 --> 06:11.872
Minority suspect!

06:11.955 --> 06:13.081
Minority suspect!

06:13.165 --> 06:15.501
Danger! He's got a gun.

06:15.584 --> 06:17.836
Oh, ow, ow! oh...

06:21.423 --> 06:22.716
Hey, Joe, the van's gone!

06:22.799 --> 06:24.593
No, no. It's got
a cloaking device

06:24.676 --> 06:26.553
that disguises it
as two homeless guys

06:26.637 --> 06:28.764
fighting over a
wedge of cheese.

06:31.225 --> 06:34.144
Hey, Peter, isn't that Lois
over there in that diner?

06:34.228 --> 06:36.438
Nah. What would Lois be doing
at a diner? I already ate.

06:36.522 --> 06:37.648
Take a look.

06:37.731 --> 06:40.192
Oh, my God, that is Lois!

06:40.275 --> 06:41.360
Why the hell
would she...

06:41.443 --> 06:42.778
Whoa, I can see
your skin cells.

06:42.861 --> 06:44.071
Oh, hey, I saw your picture

06:44.154 --> 06:45.531
on the cover
of Scientific American.

06:45.614 --> 06:47.241
You looked great.

06:47.324 --> 06:48.909
Oh, please, where my eyes
are, like, half-closed?

06:48.992 --> 06:50.661
God, just take
the damn compliment.

06:54.373 --> 06:56.708
What the hell is Lois
doing with another man?

06:56.792 --> 06:58.460
Is it possible she's a whore?

06:58.544 --> 07:01.713
You know, just on weekends to help pay
for her mom's dialysis?

07:01.797 --> 07:03.173
As in my fantasy?

07:03.257 --> 07:05.092
You know what, let's
just start over.

07:05.175 --> 07:06.301
Hi, I'm Quagmire.

07:06.385 --> 07:07.970
I wish I knew
what she was saying.

07:08.053 --> 07:09.805
I think I can help.

07:09.888 --> 07:11.932
Oh, your wife and
children are beautiful.

07:12.015 --> 07:14.142
It's so good to
catch up, Ross.

07:14.226 --> 07:15.352
I'm glad I called.

07:15.435 --> 07:16.770
I'm glad you did, too.

07:16.854 --> 07:18.772
So was your husband okay
with you coming here?

07:18.856 --> 07:22.067
Uh, yes. He turned out
to be just fine with it.

07:24.570 --> 07:27.364
All right, let's see
what we can pick up.

07:27.447 --> 07:28.824
( static )

07:28.907 --> 07:30.701
MORT GOLDMAN:
Please don't spit in my eggs.

07:30.784 --> 07:31.827
Please don't spit in my eggs.

07:31.910 --> 07:33.328
Thank you for the eggs.

07:33.412 --> 07:35.289
God, I hope
he didn't spit in my eggs.

07:35.372 --> 07:37.833
WAITER: Hey, Doug, I just spit
in that guy's eggs.

07:37.916 --> 07:39.710
-DEEP VOICE: Our armies are ready.
-( static )

07:39.793 --> 07:41.628
Soon it will be time
to leave the sewers

07:41.712 --> 07:44.089
and strike back at the humans
in the overworld.

07:45.841 --> 07:48.343
I'm glad we both
found someone to make us happy.

07:48.427 --> 07:49.553
( static )

07:49.636 --> 07:50.762
I really enjoy being
with you, Ross.

07:50.846 --> 07:51.930
I'm having a great time.

07:52.014 --> 07:53.974
Oh, my God,
that's who that is.

07:54.057 --> 07:56.101
Ross Fishman, Lois's
old boyfriend.

07:56.185 --> 07:57.311
I think we're losing them.

07:57.394 --> 07:59.062
Wait, I got to hear more.

07:59.146 --> 08:01.356
Peter, the power's not
supposed to go that high.

08:01.440 --> 08:02.816
QUAGMIRE'S VOICE:
Damn, this itches.

08:02.900 --> 08:04.484
I wonder who gave it to me.

08:04.568 --> 08:07.070
Probably that skank who needed
a ride to the gas station.

08:07.154 --> 08:09.489
Last time I do somebody a favor.

08:09.573 --> 08:11.074
Oh, God, they must've heard me.

08:11.158 --> 08:12.826
Oh, God, I can hear me!

08:12.910 --> 08:15.454
♪♪ Ba da-da-da-da-da ba-dada ♪

08:15.537 --> 08:16.830
♪♪ Bampa, bampa ♪♪

08:18.916 --> 08:21.043
( wet, lapping sound )

08:22.503 --> 08:24.087
Ugh!

08:24.171 --> 08:26.215
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

08:26.298 --> 08:28.842
I'm cleaning myself.

08:28.926 --> 08:30.802
Ugh, you were clean
15 minutes ago.

08:30.886 --> 08:32.513
Now you're just on vacation.

08:33.722 --> 08:36.225
So, Lois is seeing
old boyfriends, huh?

08:36.308 --> 08:38.018
Well, two can play at that game.

08:38.101 --> 08:39.895
I just got to find
my little black book.

08:56.703 --> 08:57.996
Ah, here it is.

09:03.460 --> 09:04.795
Uh, Brenda?

09:04.878 --> 09:05.879
( raspy-voiced ):
Peter.

09:06.004 --> 09:08.423
Oh, my God, it's been 25 years.

09:08.507 --> 09:09.633
Yeah.

09:09.716 --> 09:12.177
So, uh, I guess
you're married now, huh?

09:12.261 --> 09:13.720
Yeah.

09:13.804 --> 09:15.389
( thud )

09:16.598 --> 09:18.308
Hey, Ricky, you were right.

09:18.392 --> 09:20.185
I was pregnant.

09:23.146 --> 09:25.524
Hey, what's up, Pete?
Long time, no see.

09:25.607 --> 09:27.901
Gosh, Patty, the years
have been great to you.

09:27.985 --> 09:29.486
Well, I owe that
to my better half.

09:29.570 --> 09:31.989
Who is it, sir?

09:35.158 --> 09:36.159
Uh, Angie?

09:36.368 --> 09:37.411
Peter?

09:37.494 --> 09:39.663
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, come in.

09:47.462 --> 09:50.174
Uh, what is all this stuff?

09:50.257 --> 09:53.594
Peter, I have been waiting
for this moment for 25 years.

09:53.677 --> 09:56.722
I haven't washed my hand
since you last touched it.

09:56.805 --> 09:58.307
Oh, my God,
that's disgusting.

09:58.390 --> 09:59.725
And look, look!

09:59.808 --> 10:01.351
I've left the toilet
just as it was

10:01.435 --> 10:04.062
the night we went to prom.

10:04.146 --> 10:07.566
It's the little piece of you
that's kept your memory alive.

10:07.649 --> 10:08.775
But now I have you back.

10:08.859 --> 10:10.110
( slams )

10:10.194 --> 10:13.322
Oh, well, at least
I still have you.

10:13.405 --> 10:15.532
You hungry?

10:15.616 --> 10:16.617
( siren wailing )

10:16.783 --> 10:19.369
Oh, crap.

10:20.621 --> 10:21.830
All right,
let me handle this.

10:21.914 --> 10:23.916
You were going
65, fella.

10:23.999 --> 10:25.459
That's ten miles
over the...

10:25.542 --> 10:27.753
Why are you holding
that infant's hand?

10:27.836 --> 10:28.962
Oh, we met on the Internet.

10:29.046 --> 10:30.881
Shut up. Yes, he lured me
down to the park

10:30.964 --> 10:33.550
with promises of candy
and funny stories.

10:33.634 --> 10:36.261
Officer, you ever hear of that
Super Industrial Adhesive?

10:36.345 --> 10:37.846
Actually, yes, we have.

10:45.604 --> 10:47.689
Dad, how come you keep
looking at the door?

10:47.773 --> 10:50.150
( chuckling ):
Oh, Meg, you and your drugs.

10:50.234 --> 10:51.443
( doorbell rings )

10:51.527 --> 10:53.070
Huh, I wonder
who that could be.

10:54.571 --> 10:55.906
Peter Gifford?

10:55.989 --> 10:59.368
My God, Dora,
my old girlfriend.

10:59.451 --> 11:02.037
What a surprise that you
would want to look me up.

11:02.120 --> 11:03.997
You always thought
I was so handsome.

11:04.081 --> 11:06.208
Peter, can I see you
in the other room?

11:07.251 --> 11:08.502
Yeah, yeah,
say it.

11:08.585 --> 11:09.586
-Should I?
-Yeah.

11:09.670 --> 11:11.713
-I can't.
-Just say it.

11:11.797 --> 11:14.174
How far can you get
this banana down...

11:14.258 --> 11:16.176
I can't say it;
she's looking right at me.

11:16.260 --> 11:18.303
Peter, what the hell
is this about?

11:18.387 --> 11:19.805
I'll tell you
what it's about.

11:19.888 --> 11:21.932
It's about you
and Ross Fishman.

11:22.015 --> 11:24.017
-What?
-I saw you with him the other day

11:24.101 --> 11:25.352
breaking the fifth commandment.

11:25.435 --> 11:27.813
Congress passes these things
for a reason, Lois.

11:27.896 --> 11:29.314
That's it.

11:29.398 --> 11:31.024
Peter, you're suffocating
me with your jealousy.

11:31.108 --> 11:32.609
I can't take it anymore.

11:32.693 --> 11:34.319
I'm calling a
marriage counselor.

11:34.403 --> 11:35.946
I can't even have
coffee with a friend

11:36.029 --> 11:37.573
without you freaking out.

11:37.656 --> 11:38.657
What is your problem?

11:38.740 --> 11:40.117
You want to know
what my problem is?

11:40.200 --> 11:41.618
You want to know what
my problem is?

11:41.702 --> 11:43.412
I love too much.

11:43.495 --> 11:44.830
What are you talking about?

11:44.913 --> 11:46.790
Don't you see, Lois?
We're alive!

11:46.874 --> 11:47.875
Peter, you're scaring me.

11:47.958 --> 11:49.668
Good! Embrace the fear.

11:49.751 --> 11:50.752
Dance with me, Lois.

11:50.878 --> 11:52.546
Dance the dance of life.

11:55.132 --> 11:56.925
Yeah, maybe you should call
that marriage counselor.

11:59.469 --> 12:02.222
Mr. and Mrs. Griffin,
I've reviewed your situation

12:02.306 --> 12:03.599
and I have a suggestion.

12:03.682 --> 12:05.434
We're willing to do
whatever it takes.

12:05.517 --> 12:08.270
I'd like to put video cameras
in every room of your house

12:08.353 --> 12:11.148
so that I can observe
your uncensored behavior.

12:11.231 --> 12:13.150
Wow, just like
that show Big Brother.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.194
Except somebody
will be watching.

12:17.988 --> 12:19.865
All right, I've
looked through all the video footage

12:19.948 --> 12:21.950
and I've compiled
what I believe to be

12:22.034 --> 12:23.869
an accurate cross section
of your home life.

12:23.952 --> 12:25.037
Here are the results.

12:27.873 --> 12:29.249
Peter, give Chris
a spanking.

12:29.333 --> 12:30.626
Okay.

12:30.709 --> 12:32.711
Chris, I'm watching the game.
You know what to do.

12:34.546 --> 12:37.925
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

12:38.008 --> 12:39.801
This hurts me more
than it hurts you.

12:39.885 --> 12:40.969
Ow!

12:41.053 --> 12:44.389
"Dear Diary, Kevin is so hot.

12:44.473 --> 12:47.059
Today he was out in the yard
raking leaves."

12:47.142 --> 12:48.477
( laughing )

12:48.560 --> 12:50.646
"God, I wish he'd throw me
into that pile of leaves."

12:50.729 --> 12:53.899
( laughing )

12:53.982 --> 12:56.610
Hey, what's everybody...
Oh, my God, my diary!

12:56.693 --> 12:57.903
I hate you all!

12:57.986 --> 12:59.655
( crying )

12:59.738 --> 13:01.990
Keep going.

13:02.074 --> 13:04.993
No! It's step, hip,
step, pivot.

13:05.077 --> 13:07.120
Are you trying
to piss off the volcano?

13:07.204 --> 13:09.748
Get my back, would you?

13:09.831 --> 13:11.625
Oh, that's it.

13:11.708 --> 13:13.293
Ooh, that feels good.

13:13.377 --> 13:15.295
Hey, Lois, can you give me
a hand with this jar?

13:15.379 --> 13:17.589
Oh, for heaven's
sake, Peter.

13:17.673 --> 13:18.924
( screaming )

13:19.007 --> 13:20.175
( laughing ):
Gotcha!

13:22.761 --> 13:25.681
To be honest, I've never
seen such dysfunction.

13:25.764 --> 13:27.766
Mr. and Mrs. Griffin,
what I'm about to suggest

13:27.891 --> 13:29.768
may seem unorthodox.

13:29.935 --> 13:32.145
I recommend a
trial separation

13:32.229 --> 13:34.940
during which time I advise
that you date other people.

13:35.023 --> 13:36.233
I believe this will help you

13:36.316 --> 13:37.943
gather perspective
on your marriage.

13:38.026 --> 13:39.027
Date other people?

13:39.111 --> 13:40.487
Oh, my God.

13:40.571 --> 13:42.406
I realize that this
is very upsetting for you.

13:42.489 --> 13:45.033
That's why I've invited
Howie Mandel to lighten the mood

13:45.117 --> 13:47.327
by blowing up a surgical
glove with his nose.

13:47.452 --> 13:48.996
( inhales deeply )

13:49.121 --> 13:51.081
( inhales deeply )

13:53.166 --> 13:54.459
( gasps )

14:00.799 --> 14:02.509
( laughs )

14:07.264 --> 14:09.099
Boy, this feels
really weird, Lois.

14:09.183 --> 14:11.185
I know, but maybe
the doctor's right.

14:11.268 --> 14:12.853
This time apart
could be good for us.

14:12.936 --> 14:14.688
I don't know, Lois.

14:14.771 --> 14:17.149
Splitting up didn't
work too well for Pac-Man and his wife.

14:17.232 --> 14:18.734
Hey, come on, buddy,
forget about her.

14:18.817 --> 14:20.694
Yeah, you're too
good for her, anyway.

14:20.777 --> 14:22.321
Cheer up, man.

14:22.404 --> 14:23.822
Hey, hey, you want
to eat us?

14:23.906 --> 14:25.199
We're turning blue!

14:25.282 --> 14:27.159
Oh, my God, we got
nowhere to run!

14:27.242 --> 14:28.744
He's going to get us!

14:28.827 --> 14:30.120
He's going to get us!

14:30.204 --> 14:32.039
Oh, he's not budging.

14:32.122 --> 14:34.082
Come on, let's go to Q-Bert's.

14:34.291 --> 14:35.375
I really appreciate

14:35.459 --> 14:37.085
you putting me up,
Cleveland.

14:37.169 --> 14:39.463
Our house is
your house, Peter.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.298
I'd sit here
and chat with you

14:41.381 --> 14:43.967
but I need to get
back upstairs to Loretta

14:44.051 --> 14:48.430
because it's our anniversary
and the gettin's good.

14:48.514 --> 14:50.390
-CLEVELAND: Ow! Ow! Ow!
-( thumping )

14:50.557 --> 14:53.810
-Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
-( thumping )

14:53.894 --> 14:56.271
When is it going
to be my turn?

14:56.355 --> 14:58.941
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
( thumping )

15:00.192 --> 15:01.860
Peter, you are welcome
to stay with us

15:02.027 --> 15:03.278
as long as you like.

15:03.362 --> 15:04.446
Oh, thanks, Muriel.

15:04.530 --> 15:06.573
So, what do you guys do
for fun around here?

15:06.657 --> 15:08.283
We like to watch old movies

15:08.367 --> 15:10.202
while listening to
"Hotel California"

15:10.285 --> 15:12.704
to see if it synchs up
in a significant way

15:12.788 --> 15:15.290
and so far, no,
nothing has.

15:16.917 --> 15:18.502
( phone rings )

15:18.585 --> 15:19.878
Hello?

15:19.962 --> 15:21.338
Hey, Lois, is Peter there?

15:21.421 --> 15:22.464
Oh, hi, Quagmire.

15:22.548 --> 15:24.216
No, Peter's not home.

15:24.299 --> 15:27.469
We're, uh... we're having
some minor marital problems.

15:27.553 --> 15:30.514
Our therapist has advised us
to date other people.

15:31.640 --> 15:32.724
Hey, Lois,
you want to go out?

15:32.808 --> 15:34.059
What?

15:34.142 --> 15:35.310
I don't know, Glenn.

15:35.394 --> 15:36.770
Peter and I just separated.

15:36.854 --> 15:38.438
I feel like I need more time.

15:40.732 --> 15:41.775
How about now?

15:41.859 --> 15:44.236
Well, we are supposed
to see other people

15:44.319 --> 15:46.113
and I guess it's better
to go out with you

15:46.196 --> 15:47.322
than some sex pervert.

15:47.406 --> 15:48.532
I'm in! Giggedy-giggedy

15:48.615 --> 15:49.616
giggedy-giggedy-goo!

15:51.451 --> 15:53.453
( Stewie gasping for breath )

15:55.038 --> 15:59.001
Oh! God blast it, will you
hold it for five seconds?

15:59.084 --> 16:00.794
( panting )

16:02.880 --> 16:04.131
Okay.

16:06.592 --> 16:07.718
( lisping ):
So, Mr. Griffin

16:07.801 --> 16:08.969
how's it feel to be

16:09.052 --> 16:10.304
a bachelor on the
prowl once again?

16:10.387 --> 16:12.097
Eh, it's not as great
as you might think.

16:12.181 --> 16:13.265
I guess I just don't have

16:13.348 --> 16:14.975
the same way with women
that I used to.

16:16.143 --> 16:17.269
( coughing and choking )

16:17.352 --> 16:18.979
Mm, that was nice,
that was nice.

16:19.062 --> 16:20.397
I had a really
great time

16:20.647 --> 16:22.441
with you today,
beautiful stranger.

16:22.524 --> 16:23.567
What's your sign?

16:23.650 --> 16:25.611
( coughing )

16:25.694 --> 16:26.904
Ha, gross.

16:26.987 --> 16:28.739
I still think
you're neat, though.

16:28.822 --> 16:31.033
You should try
a video dating service, Peter.

16:31.158 --> 16:32.784
That's how Muriel and I met.

16:32.868 --> 16:34.536
Let me show you Mort's tape.

16:34.703 --> 16:36.163
He was so charming.

16:37.372 --> 16:38.749
Ah, oh, my eyes!

16:38.957 --> 16:41.752
Could you please turn down
that very bright light?

16:41.835 --> 16:44.129
It's burning my retinas.

16:44.213 --> 16:46.924
Ladies, I'm
a very desperate man.

16:47.007 --> 16:49.092
My name is Mort
and I live with my mother

16:49.176 --> 16:51.512
and I have very low standards.

16:51.595 --> 16:52.930
( sneezes )

16:53.013 --> 16:55.015
Oh, God, there's blood
in my mucous!

16:55.098 --> 16:56.183
( fly buzzing )

16:58.977 --> 17:01.897
Ahh! What the hell
is wrong with you!?!

17:03.190 --> 17:04.650
Hey, there's the mail!

17:04.733 --> 17:05.901
Oh, finally.

17:08.987 --> 17:10.572
All right, it says
it takes an hour

17:10.656 --> 17:12.324
for this solvent
to take effect.

17:12.407 --> 17:13.784
Well, let's see--
what takes an hour?

17:13.909 --> 17:16.662
We could watch Rita Rudner
do five minutes of stand-up.

17:16.870 --> 17:18.163
Ba-zing.

17:18.247 --> 17:19.248
Oh, boy, we're going

17:19.331 --> 17:20.958
to have a swell
time tonight, Lois.

17:21.041 --> 17:23.001
Glenn, thank you
for being such a good friend

17:23.085 --> 17:24.378
and looking after me like this.

17:24.545 --> 17:25.712
No problem.

17:25.796 --> 17:27.881
It's kind of chilly out,
so I brought you a jacket.

17:27.965 --> 17:29.716
No, thanks, I'll be fine.

17:29.800 --> 17:31.134
Please?

17:35.097 --> 17:36.765
Peter, Muriel
and I both feel

17:36.849 --> 17:39.768
that you need to follow
your therapist's advice

17:39.852 --> 17:41.144
and start dating.

17:41.228 --> 17:43.355
Oh, jeez, Mort,
I don't know if I'm ready.

17:43.438 --> 17:44.523
Oh, come on, stud.

17:44.606 --> 17:46.066
We've got it all
set up for you

17:46.149 --> 17:47.526
to go out
with our niece.

17:47.609 --> 17:50.279
Honey, come on out here
and meet Peter Griffin!

17:50.362 --> 17:53.657
Peter, this is our niece,
Jennifer Love Hewitt.

17:53.740 --> 17:54.741
Nice to meet you.

17:54.825 --> 17:56.118
All right, I'm getting up.

17:56.201 --> 17:57.202
Hi. Peter Griffin.

17:57.286 --> 17:58.495
So where do you
want to go?

17:58.579 --> 18:00.247
We can go anywhere
except the disco.

18:00.330 --> 18:01.748
They don't let me
in there anymore.

18:01.832 --> 18:04.543
( dance music playing )

18:09.256 --> 18:11.425
Ah! Oh!

18:11.508 --> 18:13.886
Crafty Mexicans
and your glass candy.

18:16.847 --> 18:18.098
Hey, what's going on?

18:18.182 --> 18:19.641
There's a little girl
down in that well.

18:19.808 --> 18:20.893
Oh, my God.

18:20.976 --> 18:22.060
Unfortunately, nobody's arms

18:22.144 --> 18:23.562
are long enough to reach her

18:23.645 --> 18:25.314
except that one guy,
but he's helping that woman

18:25.397 --> 18:26.398
tickle a midget in a tree.

18:26.481 --> 18:28.901
Tee-hee. Oh, stop!

18:29.026 --> 18:30.402
Tee-hee.

18:30.485 --> 18:31.778
( giggling )

18:32.196 --> 18:35.741
Oh, God, you want
to rescue her, don't you?

18:35.824 --> 18:37.117
Ugh. It's times like this

18:37.201 --> 18:39.161
I wish they'd used me
for stem cell research.

18:40.120 --> 18:41.830
Help me!

18:41.914 --> 18:43.582
"It rubs the lotion on its skin

18:43.665 --> 18:45.667
or else it gets
the hose again." Ha!

18:45.751 --> 18:47.920
All right,
I'm going to lower you in.

18:50.255 --> 18:52.174
I just noticed--
how often do you see

18:52.257 --> 18:54.218
a 17th century well
in this day and age?

18:54.426 --> 18:55.761
Hurry up!
The glue's wearing off!

18:55.844 --> 18:57.179
All right, all right.

19:04.686 --> 19:05.687
We did it.

19:05.771 --> 19:06.813
Job well done.

19:06.897 --> 19:08.315
And we're not stuck
together anymore.

19:08.398 --> 19:09.733
Thank God.
You said it.

19:09.816 --> 19:11.652
You want to hold hands
on the walk home?

19:11.735 --> 19:12.736
Yeah, sure.

19:12.819 --> 19:13.987
Oh, Suzie.

19:14.071 --> 19:15.656
Thank God, you're all right.

19:15.739 --> 19:17.074
Wait a minute, this
isn't my little girl.

19:17.157 --> 19:19.451
Hey, that was my wife!

19:20.744 --> 19:21.745
Tee-hee.
Tee-hee.

19:23.956 --> 19:25.290
I Know What You Did
Last Summer?

19:25.374 --> 19:26.375
No, never
heard of it.

19:26.458 --> 19:27.584
The Devil and Daniel Webster?

19:27.668 --> 19:28.669
Nope.

19:28.752 --> 19:29.753
Party of Five?

19:29.837 --> 19:30.838
Was that a porno?

19:30.921 --> 19:31.922
( sighs )

19:32.005 --> 19:33.006
Don't worry about it.

19:33.090 --> 19:34.550
Sometimes you got
to do a lot of crap

19:34.633 --> 19:35.926
before they put you
in anything decent.

19:36.009 --> 19:37.886
Oh, the food here
is fantastic.

19:37.970 --> 19:40.097
This is where I took Lois
on our first date.

19:40.180 --> 19:42.766
You ordered a pie
for an appetizer?

19:42.850 --> 19:43.934
Don't worry.
I'll go to the john

19:44.059 --> 19:45.727
and fire one out
in about five minutes.

19:45.811 --> 19:47.229
That should make
some room for dinner.

19:47.312 --> 19:48.814
Here's your table,
Mr. Quagmire.

19:48.897 --> 19:50.774
Thanks. Hey, how about
a couple of drinks?

19:50.858 --> 19:52.192
Certainly, sir.
Martini for you

19:52.276 --> 19:54.111
and the usual
roofie colada for your date?

19:54.194 --> 19:55.362
No, no, no...

19:55.529 --> 19:56.530
( mumbling )

19:56.613 --> 19:57.698
...glass of wine.

19:59.116 --> 20:01.743
Oh, my God, it's
Jennifer Love Hewitt!

20:01.827 --> 20:04.079
Wow, I wonder
who she's here with.

20:04.162 --> 20:06.707
She could date any
man she wanted to.

20:09.293 --> 20:10.627
There, made lots of room.

20:10.752 --> 20:12.504
Hey, waiter, that sign
in the bathroom

20:12.588 --> 20:13.630
about washing your hands--

20:13.714 --> 20:15.299
that's only
for the staff, right?

20:15.382 --> 20:16.884
Uh, technically, yes.

20:16.967 --> 20:18.677
That's what I thought. Great.

20:18.760 --> 20:21.054
Oh, man, these all
look good, every one of them.

20:21.138 --> 20:22.264
Hey, you want some bread?

20:22.347 --> 20:23.515
No!

20:23.724 --> 20:25.267
Peter, is that you?

20:25.893 --> 20:26.935
Peter? Oh, no!

20:27.019 --> 20:28.312
I can't let him see me!

20:28.395 --> 20:29.771
It's okay,
Quagmire.

20:29.855 --> 20:32.441
We're just doing what the
therapist said we should do.

20:32.524 --> 20:33.859
Peter, I think
it's great

20:33.942 --> 20:35.652
you're out
with Jennifer Love Hewitt.

20:35.736 --> 20:37.154
Hi.

20:37.237 --> 20:38.655
I loved you
in Heartbreakers.

20:38.739 --> 20:40.115
You be on your
best behavior.

20:41.074 --> 20:43.285
Here you go,
sweetheart, open up.

20:43.368 --> 20:44.536
No!

20:44.661 --> 20:45.662
There you go.

20:45.746 --> 20:47.164
Isn't this romantic?

20:47.247 --> 20:48.457
That's it.

20:48.540 --> 20:50.083
You have got to be the most vile

20:50.167 --> 20:52.127
disgusting human being
I've ever met

20:52.211 --> 20:54.046
and I have
never been

20:54.129 --> 20:56.340
more turned on
in my life.

20:58.091 --> 20:59.218
Hold on, toot!

20:59.301 --> 21:00.969
I don't care
what our therapist says

21:01.053 --> 21:03.096
I'm not going to stand by
and watch my husband

21:03.180 --> 21:04.181
lock lips
with another woman!

21:04.264 --> 21:05.265
Now beat it!

21:05.349 --> 21:06.975
What's your
problem, grandma?

21:07.059 --> 21:10.270
You are, and I only
saw Heartbreakers on a plane!

21:10.354 --> 21:13.774
And the flight was delayed,
so the headphones were free!

21:13.857 --> 21:15.901
Wow, that was
pretty cool, Lois.

21:15.984 --> 21:18.028
Huh, gosh, I guess
I finally understand...

21:18.111 --> 21:19.404
( screaming )

21:22.241 --> 21:24.493
Yeah, you better run,
you little bitch!

21:24.576 --> 21:26.578
I guess I finally
understand how you

21:26.662 --> 21:28.539
can get so jealous
sometimes.

21:28.622 --> 21:31.625
Oh, seeing her kiss you
like that just made me crazy.

21:31.708 --> 21:33.961
Well, I-I guess we're
just going to have to learn

21:34.044 --> 21:35.045
to control our jealousy...

21:35.128 --> 21:36.129
together.

21:36.213 --> 21:37.297
Together.

21:37.381 --> 21:39.091
Ma'am, you dropped
your napkin.

21:39.174 --> 21:40.509
Here's your drink, sir.

21:40.592 --> 21:42.135
Eh, we'll work
on it later.

21:42.219 --> 21:43.637
I love you, Lois.

21:43.720 --> 21:45.430
I love you, too, Peter.

21:48.225 --> 21:50.018
What a couple of freaks.

21:50.102 --> 21:51.645
God, I need a drink.

21:51.728 --> 21:53.939
Waiter, martini
and a roofie colada!
