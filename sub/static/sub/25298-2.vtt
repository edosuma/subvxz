-Cricket!

09:33.283 --> 09:35.745
-Stop fighting!
-You don't have to do this!

09:35.745 --> 09:38.078
I'll put you
on the quilt myself!

09:38.078 --> 09:39.699
Don't get involved!

09:39.699 --> 09:41.871
I'm wrestling the toughest beast
in the city!

09:41.871 --> 09:44.084
Aaaah!

09:44.084 --> 09:45.705
Unnh!

09:45.705 --> 09:46.706

[panting]

09:47.877 --> 09:49.919
Had enough?

09:49.919 --> 09:52.092
Cricket, you can't beat Gramma,
and you know it.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.713
Just end this foolishness!

09:53.713 --> 09:55.845
You're right, Dad.

09:55.845 --> 09:57.927
I can't beat Gramma.

09:57.927 --> 10:00.720
-And I don't need to!
-Huh?

10:00.720 --> 10:02.812
All this time I was trying
to get on this quilt

10:02.812 --> 10:04.564
because that's how things
are done in this family.

10:04.564 --> 10:06.936
But I don't care if you
don't consider me a Green,

10:06.936 --> 10:08.898
'cause I<i> feel</i> like a Green.

10:08.898 --> 10:10.780
I<i> know</i> I'm a Green.

10:10.780 --> 10:13.903
And that's something no one
can ever take away from me.

10:13.903 --> 10:16.116
Boy, I'm proud of you.

10:16.116 --> 10:19.539
It takes real grit
to stand up to family--

10:19.539 --> 10:21.161
Aaah!

10:21.161 --> 10:22.912
Never let your guard down!

10:22.912 --> 10:25.125
Aah! Are you crazy?

10:25.125 --> 10:26.836
Papa, start the count.

10:26.836 --> 10:28.918
One, two,

10:28.918 --> 10:30.710
three!

10:30.710 --> 10:32.922
Admit it, Gramma.
You're pinned!

10:32.922 --> 10:34.844
Uh, I'm pinned.

10:34.844 --> 10:37.257
I knew you had it in you...

10:37.257 --> 10:39.058
Cricket<i> Green.</i>

10:39.058 --> 10:40.470

Aw, glad to see you two
are gettin' along again.

10:53.363 --> 10:54.534
Yeah.

10:54.534 --> 10:56.156

11:02.992 --> 11:04.414
One more time,
all of nothin'.

11:04.414 --> 11:05.955
If you say so,

11:05.955 --> 11:08.548
but my lucky coin
always comes up heads.

11:09.839 --> 11:12.172
Tails, tails, tails,
tails, tails, tails!

11:12.172 --> 11:14.294
Heads again?!

11:14.294 --> 11:15.885
It's just not your day,

11:29.148 --> 11:30.400
What the-- Ooh!

11:30.400 --> 11:32.021
What kind of
ice cream truck was that?

11:32.021 --> 11:34.234
[Tilly] Cricket,
that was a food truck.

11:34.234 --> 11:36.576
Food... truck?
Ya mean... ?

11:36.576 --> 11:38.988
It's exactly
what you think it is.

11:38.988 --> 11:41.581
Oh... my... gravy!

11:41.581 --> 11:42.822

-[plate shatters]
-Food trucks?

11:45.285 --> 11:47.086
-Cricket, you just ate.
-Nooo!

11:47.086 --> 11:48.588
C'mere!
Think about it.

11:48.588 --> 11:49.959
We got a garden full
of plants.

11:49.959 --> 11:51.211
That's basically food.

11:51.211 --> 11:52.332
And we got our truck.

11:52.332 --> 11:53.963
That's basically a truck.

11:53.963 --> 11:55.425
We should start
a food truck!

11:55.425 --> 11:56.886
I can't believe
I'm sayin' this,

11:56.886 --> 11:58.888
but that's
a great idea, son!

11:58.888 --> 12:00.179
Potatoes are in season.

12:00.179 --> 12:01.431
I could make french fries.

12:01.431 --> 12:02.892
-I'm on it!

12:02.892 --> 12:04.434

What's the matter
with ya, boy?!

12:33.633 --> 12:35.214
I don't know!
Lots of stuff, I guess!

12:35.214 --> 12:37.046
Ain't ya ever heard

-of the blue tater?!
-[horror movie stinger]

12:39.679 --> 12:42.221
-What?
-The curse of the blue tater

12:42.221 --> 12:44.934

13:00.360 --> 13:02.822
That spud is bad news,

13:02.822 --> 13:06.075
You've brought
great misfortune
to us all!

13:06.075 --> 13:07.327
Aw, don't be ridiculous,
Gramma.

13:07.327 --> 13:08.708
It's just a potato.

13:08.708 --> 13:10.079
But if it makes
you feel better,

13:10.079 --> 13:11.711
there, gone forever.

13:13.333 --> 13:14.334
What a nice day.

13:14.334 --> 13:15.915
-Ooh!

13:15.915 --> 13:18.298
And that is the end
of th--

13:18.298 --> 13:20.880
Aah! The tater!

13:20.880 --> 13:22.131
Oh, no! It came back!

13:22.131 --> 13:24.424
The curse is real?!

13:24.424 --> 13:26.135
Of course it's real,
ya dingbat!

13:26.135 --> 13:27.557
Mm mm mm...

13:27.557 --> 13:28.638
What do we do?

13:28.638 --> 13:29.889
How do you break the curse?

13:29.889 --> 13:32.141
We need to perform
a special ritual.

13:32.141 --> 13:34.984
I need snake venom,
dirt from a fresh grave,

13:34.984 --> 13:36.356
and sour cream.

13:36.356 --> 13:38.398
I have the first two
in my purse,

13:38.398 --> 13:41.200
but your sister
keeps eatin'
all my sour cream,

13:41.200 --> 13:43.363
which I need
for my taquitos!

13:43.363 --> 13:44.364
What's that now?

13:44.364 --> 13:46.115
Can't we just destroy it?

13:46.115 --> 13:48.117
No! If you destroy it,

13:48.117 --> 13:49.869
the curse is permanent!

13:49.869 --> 13:52.331
You'll have bad luck
for the rest of your life!

13:52.331 --> 13:54.624
-Hey, where'd it go?
-[gasp] It's gone!

13:54.624 --> 13:57.126

Alrighty then.

Oh, yeah! Heh heh.
Looks pretty stupid, huh?

14:06.426 --> 14:08.017
-Don't touch it! It's cursed!
-Aah!

14:08.017 --> 14:09.389
It'll melt your skin off!

14:09.389 --> 14:11.020
And then your eyeballs
will fall out!

14:11.020 --> 14:12.932
And then your blood
will curdle into cheese!

14:12.932 --> 14:15.855
Aw, Gramma's been fillin'
your head with nonsense again.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.777
There's no such thing
as bad luck.

14:17.777 --> 14:20.940
Besides, I need every potato
available to make fries.

14:20.940 --> 14:22.151
Mwah!

14:22.151 --> 14:24.153
Aw, don't kiss it!!

14:24.153 --> 14:25.655
Anyway, quit your worryin'.

14:25.655 --> 14:29.989
And check out
the new and improved
Green family food truck!

14:29.989 --> 14:31.411
It was easy.

14:31.411 --> 14:33.413
Just put a bunch of our kitchen
appliances in my truck.

14:33.413 --> 14:35.705
I even thought
of the perfect name for it.

14:35.705 --> 14:37.997
"It's... French Fries."

14:37.997 --> 14:38.918
See?

14:41.170 --> 14:43.132
Aw, ain't she pretty.

14:43.132 --> 14:45.134
Yeah, she's pretty!
Pretty dangerous!

14:45.134 --> 14:46.636
This whole thing
is a death trap!

14:46.636 --> 14:48.428
This could fall
on someone!

-[sizzling]
-This could burn
someone's face off!

14:49.969 --> 14:51.390

get in your eyes
and sting 'em!

14:52.972 --> 14:55.725
Aaah!
The curse is real!

14:55.725 --> 14:57.727
Oh, for Pete's sake,
knock it off.

14:57.727 --> 14:59.439
I need everyone's help today.

14:59.439 --> 15:01.521
I don't wanna
hear one more word
about this curse business.

15:01.521 --> 15:03.693
-But, Dad...
-Not. One.

15:10.199 --> 15:12.161
Tilly,
you're my favorite sibling.

15:12.161 --> 15:14.033
I can't let you go
to the food trucks.

15:14.033 --> 15:17.206
But I wanted to eat tacos
and smell the diesel.

15:17.206 --> 15:19.839
Oh, sweet sister,
it's too perilous.

15:19.839 --> 15:23.042
Hmm. I'll use
my lucky coin to guide me!

tails I stay.

15:27.757 --> 15:29.008
Guess I'm goin'.

15:29.008 --> 15:31.891
Thank you for decidin'
my fate, lucky coin.

15:31.891 --> 15:34.554
-Mmm...
-All right, boy, listen up!

15:34.554 --> 15:36.145
I got a plan.

15:36.145 --> 15:37.897
Once we're at
the Food Truck Round-Up,

15:37.897 --> 15:41.190
I can get some sour cream
to complete the ritual.

15:41.190 --> 15:43.062

what do we do about the curse?

16:07.426 --> 16:09.258
Huh. Must have
put it in reverse.

Weird. I've never
done that before.

16:11.260 --> 16:12.972
Meh.
I can fix that later.

let this get us down!
