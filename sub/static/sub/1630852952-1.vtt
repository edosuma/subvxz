01:00.542 --> 01:05.125
Citizens! During their air raids
over our towns

01:05.958 --> 01:09.667
the enemy drops numerous fire bombs.

01:11.375 --> 01:13.667
These bombs can cause extensive fires.

01:14.417 --> 01:17.042
However, prevention of such fires

01:17.792 --> 01:21.625
depends primarily on the population.

01:26.125 --> 01:33.125
Air raid shelter

01:45.625 --> 01:47.042
Somebody help!

01:48.333 --> 01:50.375
Help me!

01:50.458 --> 01:52.125
Shut up, you bitch! I'll kill you!

01:53.792 --> 01:54.792
Vaga, look out!

01:58.542 --> 02:00.833
Drop the gun, pal. I'll cut her throat.

02:01.333 --> 02:02.583
You son of a bitch!

02:05.833 --> 02:07.833
Stop!

02:13.667 --> 02:14.833
The bastards are gone.

02:17.417 --> 02:18.417
Are you hurt?

02:20.417 --> 02:21.750
You're bleeding.

02:28.583 --> 02:30.750
It's okay, you're all right.

02:31.458 --> 02:32.583
Just relax, okay?

02:33.125 --> 02:36.292
- What is it?
- They took my food stamps.

02:38.417 --> 02:39.958
I just got them today.

02:42.917 --> 02:45.833
Okay, let's get you up.
Come on, here we go.

02:48.458 --> 02:49.458
It'll all be okay.

02:53.833 --> 02:55.292
Let me walk you home.

03:32.125 --> 03:33.417
Shota, we 're nearby.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.750
- Look out for the convoy.
- Affirmative, looking out.

03:37.833 --> 03:41.542
Demyansk

04:08.417 --> 04:10.625
To a distant land

04:11.208 --> 04:13.625
my dear friend takes flight

04:14.542 --> 04:19.250
our native winds following in the night

04:19.333 --> 04:24.750
and his beloved city melts into blue mist

04:58.708 --> 05:01.333
I have visual on the convoy!
I see the convoy!

05:01.917 --> 05:03.333
Get ready, shota.

05:13.917 --> 05:16.667
Hang in there, nikanor.
It's about to get hot.

06:29.042 --> 06:30.875
Loaded!

07:00.667 --> 07:03.250
How are you doing, nikanor? Still alive?

07:03.958 --> 07:06.583
It's nikodim, senior lieutenant.

07:07.500 --> 07:08.625
I'm okay.

07:09.042 --> 07:13.167
Just a bit shaken up.
It's not easy flying backwards.

07:13.792 --> 07:17.208
You did fine for a rookie.

07:18.583 --> 07:23.958
Just when will my dear friend return?

07:25.083 --> 07:28.500
Our native winds
will surely go to meet him

07:29.458 --> 07:33.667
and his beloved city
will surely smile to greet him

07:42.542 --> 07:44.958
Messerschmitts, sir! Messerschmitts!

07:48.625 --> 07:52.792
Sir, they're turning back!
They're beating it!

07:54.250 --> 07:55.875
Senior lieutenant!

07:57.042 --> 07:58.792
It's me, nikodim!

08:09.125 --> 08:11.375
Senior lieutenant!

08:12.292 --> 08:14.333
It's me, nikodim!

08:18.875 --> 08:20.375
Nikolay, look!

08:55.875 --> 08:57.416
The messers are on our six!

08:57.417 --> 09:00.333
- They're coming at us!
- I see them.

09:07.208 --> 09:09.458
We're in position. Spread formation!

09:52.500 --> 09:54.958
The machine gun's fucking stuck!

10:08.083 --> 10:11.667
What's wrong, Ivan, out of ammo?

10:34.333 --> 10:36.750
Great job, my friend. Beautiful!

11:06.417 --> 11:09.083
We're losing fuel. Preparing to land.

11:32.500 --> 11:36.208
Watch out, incoming fighters!

11:37.042 --> 11:38.792
Move it! Incoming fighters!

12:00.583 --> 12:02.833
Faster, keep going!

12:13.208 --> 12:15.583
- Commander!
- I know.

12:44.167 --> 12:45.333
Shota,

12:47.000 --> 12:48.457
the smoke bomb's stuck.

12:48.458 --> 12:51.833
- Are we going to make it back to base?
- We'll try to land as is.

13:25.417 --> 13:26.833
Hang in there, shota.

14:01.750 --> 14:02.917
Nikolay.

14:03.750 --> 14:05.000
Nikolay!

14:06.667 --> 14:07.833
Shota...

14:09.167 --> 14:10.750
We have to torch the plane.

14:17.083 --> 14:19.417
Quick, get out!

14:21.167 --> 14:23.208
Hurry up! Get out there!

14:35.167 --> 14:36.625
Shota, that's enough.

14:37.500 --> 14:39.417
Leave the machine gun. She's done for.

14:44.292 --> 14:45.583
Here it is...

14:46.292 --> 14:48.208
You little fucker...

14:50.750 --> 14:53.417
- What's the hold-up?
- Germans.

14:57.708 --> 14:59.500
The machine gun's not done yet.

15:34.167 --> 15:35.458
Now she's done!

15:38.292 --> 15:39.500
Cover me!

16:02.667 --> 16:04.250
Let's go, shota.

16:07.542 --> 16:08.542
Fire!

16:15.250 --> 16:16.250
Fire!

16:21.708 --> 16:22.958
Nikolay...

16:33.958 --> 16:36.167
Quickly, come on!

18:13.875 --> 18:15.042
Shota?

19:11.917 --> 19:15.291
- Damn it.
- Calm down.

19:15.292 --> 19:19.000
We'll report it to the senior lieutenant.
He won't get far.

19:50.958 --> 19:52.083
Moscow

21:10.375 --> 21:12.333
Demyansk

21:12.417 --> 21:13.625
valday

21:13.708 --> 21:15.375
vyshny volochyok

21:19.375 --> 21:21.375
Moscow

21:40.625 --> 21:44.042
Here we are. Bye, Olga. Take care!

21:47.458 --> 21:50.833
Goncharova! Tomorrow, seven o'clock sharp.
Don't be late!

21:55.167 --> 21:56.375
You?

21:59.125 --> 22:00.833
I didn't recognize you right away.

22:02.083 --> 22:05.000
Well, those anti-tank trenches
don't dig themselves.

22:06.833 --> 22:09.875
It's been a month since I last flew,
but I'm still getting rations.

22:10.500 --> 22:11.624
Seems unfair.

22:11.625 --> 22:13.417
Anyway... this is for you.

22:21.167 --> 22:22.292
What about you?

22:22.875 --> 22:25.000
It's fine. We pilots get plenty.

22:27.417 --> 22:28.583
I can't.

22:32.833 --> 22:33.958
Look.

22:34.667 --> 22:35.832
You don't owe me anything.

22:35.833 --> 22:38.250
And they took your stamps, didn't they?

22:39.292 --> 22:40.708
Oh, and this...

22:47.083 --> 22:48.792
I'm nikolay, by the way.

22:50.708 --> 22:52.417
Olga goncharova.

29:57.500 --> 30:01.917
Feldgendarmerie.
What the hell are they doing here?

30:07.083 --> 30:11.125
There was an air strike,
senior lieutenant. Fighters.

30:11.708 --> 30:13.375
Three men killed.

30:32.542 --> 30:37.000
How strange. A pistol-caliber fighter?

30:38.417 --> 30:40.208
Where did you find him?

30:40.542 --> 30:44.250
In that gulley over there. Under a tree.

30:46.042 --> 30:49.874
May I ask what brings you here,
senior lieutenant?

30:49.875 --> 30:52.999
We're looking for a Russian pilot.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.958
He's somewhere in this area.

31:32.708 --> 31:34.667
I got a new bird today.

31:35.583 --> 31:38.750
I'm going to tushino with my gunner
tomorrow to get her.

31:39.250 --> 31:40.292
A new bird?

31:40.708 --> 31:42.458
Aircraft. An ii-2.

31:43.083 --> 31:44.333
Ever heard of it?

31:45.042 --> 31:48.166
No. I haven't.

31:48.167 --> 31:51.125
It's a test model.
There'll be hundreds soon.

31:51.458 --> 31:53.458
The Germans call it "the black death".

31:54.292 --> 31:57.000
What about you? What do you do?

31:57.750 --> 31:59.458
Silva

32:02.292 --> 32:03.458
I work there.

32:04.333 --> 32:05.833
Goncharova?

32:07.542 --> 32:10.292
Operetta theater. You're joking!

32:10.917 --> 32:12.750
You thought I was a trench digger?

32:14.542 --> 32:16.792
I've never been to an operetta before.

32:17.958 --> 32:19.125
Will you show me?

32:19.667 --> 32:22.082
It will have to be after the war.

32:22.083 --> 32:24.458
The theater was evacuated and I'm...

32:25.333 --> 32:27.875
You know... stuck here.

37:55.458 --> 37:56.500
Nikola y!

38:09.208 --> 38:11.625
Why didn't you write that you were coming?

38:12.167 --> 38:13.833
I didn't know 'til yesterday.

38:15.208 --> 38:16.750
But I can't stay. I'm sorry.

38:17.458 --> 38:20.708
Looks like it's hello and goodbye in one.

38:24.292 --> 38:25.792
What time do you have to leave?

38:27.208 --> 38:28.667
Tomorrow at six.

38:33.250 --> 38:34.375
Would you come with me?

39:27.208 --> 39:29.417
- I have to go.
- Just wait a second.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.624
You have no idea
how hard it is just waiting.

39:33.625 --> 39:36.208
Not even knowing where you are
or if you're okay.

39:37.292 --> 39:39.417
I thought you were hurt once.

39:40.083 --> 39:41.458
Here...

39:42.792 --> 39:44.208
And here...

39:45.750 --> 39:48.000
- Olga...
- Wait.

39:50.625 --> 39:53.332
You're not alone now. There are two of us.

39:53.333 --> 39:55.833
Don't forget that there are two of us.

39:56.500 --> 39:58.458
Promise me you'll come back.

39:59.375 --> 40:03.042
You know there's a war going on.
And I'm a soldier.

40:04.125 --> 40:07.250
I know. I do.

40:07.958 --> 40:09.958
I know you're the bravest,

40:11.667 --> 40:13.333
strongest soldier out there.

40:18.292 --> 40:21.583
Promise me you'll come back. Swear it.

40:26.333 --> 40:28.000
I promise.

41:54.917 --> 41:56.625
Just lie still there, pilot.

41:57.917 --> 42:00.042
And don't go grabbing your gun.

42:02.250 --> 42:05.250
Keep quiet and stay still,
if you want to live.

42:16.042 --> 42:17.292
There.

42:22.583 --> 42:23.958
Stop.

42:24.500 --> 42:26.042
Whoa there!

42:37.125 --> 42:38.542
Where's your gun?

42:40.083 --> 42:41.291
I don't understand.

42:41.292 --> 42:43.750
Your gun? Bang bang!

42:46.250 --> 42:49.292
My good soldiers, I don't have a gun.

42:50.458 --> 42:53.457
Here. I killed it with this stick.

42:53.458 --> 42:56.749
You can't shoot in the forest anymore,
you'll get killed.

42:56.750 --> 42:59.750
The wolf fell into a pit,
then I hit him with this.

43:00.125 --> 43:02.500
Right at the back of the neck.

43:03.833 --> 43:06.708
Is he saying
he killed that thing with a stick?

43:07.167 --> 43:09.249
Seems like it.

43:09.250 --> 43:12.041
Jesus, what the hell are we doing here?

43:12.042 --> 43:15.292
They go around
killing wolves with wooden sticks.

43:15.958 --> 43:18.042
Tell him to scram.

43:19.375 --> 43:20.666
Go on.

43:20.667 --> 43:21.875
Move it!

43:22.917 --> 43:24.083
Go on!

43:25.167 --> 43:27.500
Let's go.

43:28.125 --> 43:29.542
Come on.

43:45.542 --> 43:46.542
Halt.

43:58.375 --> 43:59.708
Go on, sweetheart,

44:00.583 --> 44:04.167
bring us some rags and hot water.
You can see how bad he is.

44:05.583 --> 44:06.583
Go on.

44:07.375 --> 44:08.625
Mother of god...

44:30.292 --> 44:33.500
- Were those Germans, dad?
- Go get your doctor, and hurry.

44:45.833 --> 44:48.124
Nothing to see here.
Go look out the window.

44:48.125 --> 44:49.792
I don't see anyone out there.

45:04.917 --> 45:07.833
Well, doctor? What's the verdict?

45:09.250 --> 45:10.500
I'm a medic.

45:11.333 --> 45:12.542
And it's bad.

45:13.292 --> 45:14.583
Frostbite.

45:15.500 --> 45:18.499
Is he going to die, medic?

45:18.500 --> 45:21.708
He needs to be operated on and fast.

45:22.667 --> 45:24.291
Can you do it?

45:26.125 --> 45:28.625
I think he might have double pneumonia.

45:31.125 --> 45:32.958
Let's get him into the cellar, ignat.

46:04.542 --> 46:05.625
Dad.

46:09.083 --> 46:10.958
Why did you bring him here?

46:11.792 --> 46:13.292
He's not going to make it.

46:14.167 --> 46:16.292
Just cause us more problems.

46:16.667 --> 46:20.042
Look, the medic's going flat out,
and all for nothing.

46:20.500 --> 46:22.125
You shut your mouth.

46:22.667 --> 46:24.042
Quit yammering.

46:24.833 --> 46:26.042
He's one of ours.

46:26.583 --> 46:29.999
Look at his papers,
and the patches on his shirt.

46:30.000 --> 46:31.417
And what have you got?

46:31.917 --> 46:33.083
A prick in your pants?

46:33.667 --> 46:35.167
We're surrounded by the enemy.

46:35.500 --> 46:40.041
If you get a red commander
out of here with papers and weapons,

46:40.042 --> 46:42.417
they'll look at you differently.

46:46.667 --> 46:48.667
There's nowhere to get him out to, dad.

46:49.750 --> 46:52.708
The Germans will take Moscow any day now.

46:55.667 --> 46:58.542
If they do,
you'll have to get him further.

46:59.625 --> 47:02.917
You're not sitting around here,
son-in-law or not.

47:03.625 --> 47:07.917
You're going to bring
the red army back here with you.

47:12.083 --> 47:15.208
Moscow

47:18.833 --> 47:20.042
the Germans are here.

47:32.125 --> 47:37.125
Hey, blacksmith.
Senior lieutenant requires your help.

47:37.875 --> 47:41.042
Oh, okay. Did it break?

47:42.458 --> 47:46.541
It's a little bent.
Motorbikes don't last long on our roads.

47:46.542 --> 47:47.582
Give me a moment.

47:47.583 --> 47:48.667
Get to it.

47:49.958 --> 47:55.542
- Thank you, you may go.
- Yes, senior lieutenant.

48:01.500 --> 48:03.292
Oh my god...

48:07.042 --> 48:09.750
You're pretty fluent in Russian, officer.

48:10.250 --> 48:13.208
That's none of your concern.
Don't go running your mouth.

48:15.083 --> 48:17.125
We've already got a report on you.

48:18.292 --> 48:21.542
It says you're a collective farmer,
a bolshevik.

48:22.542 --> 48:24.917
That your son-in-law's in the red army.

48:26.875 --> 48:30.874
That sergeant got it all wrong. Sir...

48:30.875 --> 48:33.833
He's a no-hoper at our language.
How can we explain it to him?

48:35.542 --> 48:37.902
They put pretty much everyone
in collective farms back then.

48:38.583 --> 48:41.917
And as for my son-in-law...
Yes, he's in the army.

48:42.833 --> 48:46.250
But what can you do?
He got his summons and that was that.

48:46.792 --> 48:48.917
It was back before the war.

48:55.417 --> 49:00.125
Why didn't you leave with your people,
bolshevik?

49:03.417 --> 49:04.750
Where would I go?

49:05.583 --> 49:06.917
This is my home.

49:16.083 --> 49:18.125
And where's your son-in-law now?

49:19.625 --> 49:21.375
- Who knows?
- Quiet!

49:32.083 --> 49:33.167
My head.

49:42.458 --> 49:43.542
What was that?

49:45.167 --> 49:46.333
Rats.

49:48.292 --> 49:49.583
It's warm in here.

49:55.167 --> 49:56.500
So they keep crawling in.

50:27.500 --> 50:28.542
Sure...

50:31.250 --> 50:32.500
Rats.

51:18.375 --> 51:21.499
Motorbikes don't last long on our roads.

51:21.500 --> 51:22.958
Give me a moment.

51:28.250 --> 51:29.333
On your feet!

51:30.375 --> 51:31.500
Come with me!

51:43.000 --> 51:44.083
Against the wall!

51:44.542 --> 51:46.542
- What's wrong, officer?
- Face the wall!

52:16.667 --> 52:19.417
How far do you think
we are from our troops?

52:20.708 --> 52:22.207
Who knows?

52:22.208 --> 52:25.125
We're heading towards them,
but they're headed away from us.

52:32.042 --> 52:36.041
Shame, and to think
they were right under our noses.

52:36.042 --> 52:40.166
They must have set off right away, sir.
Just as you entered the house.

52:40.167 --> 52:42.833
- Will you be needing my men?
- No.

52:43.500 --> 52:46.166
The daughter said
there's only three of them.

52:46.167 --> 52:49.708
The pilot's badly injured.
And they have no weapons.

52:50.833 --> 52:53.000
We'll set out at dawn.

54:10.083 --> 54:11.875
That's them.

55:07.708 --> 55:09.958
Footprints are gone.
Everything's covered in snow.

55:10.042 --> 55:13.666
Senior lieutenant, should we turn back?

55:13.667 --> 55:18.208
They're near. You, 50 meters
to the left, and you, to the right.

55:38.292 --> 55:40.000
I can't see shit!

55:41.125 --> 55:45.583
We should leave him for a while.
Go see where we're going next.

56:09.750 --> 56:11.708
It's like the goddamn apocalypse.

56:16.208 --> 56:18.042
There's a windbreak.

56:19.625 --> 56:21.208
About four kilometers ahead.

56:23.417 --> 56:25.417
If we head through it,

56:26.708 --> 56:28.542
we'll get to where we need to go.

56:30.083 --> 56:32.125
If we go right now.

56:34.833 --> 56:38.292
We should go back for the captain.

57:38.833 --> 57:40.125
Holy shit!

57:40.542 --> 57:44.792
We need to get out of here.
There have to be more Germans around.

57:46.125 --> 57:48.625
This is one hell of a mess
you've got me into.

57:53.458 --> 57:55.708
Let's give him up to the Germans,
can't we?

57:56.375 --> 57:58.125
They'll treat us all right.

58:05.000 --> 58:07.042
You bastard, I saved you.

58:08.125 --> 58:09.457
Took you to my father-in-law.

58:09.458 --> 58:13.250
Go to hell, you ungrateful shit!
You and that pilot of yours!

58:13.625 --> 58:14.917
I'm going to keep on living.

58:17.083 --> 58:18.292
Captain!

58:33.542 --> 58:36.917
- Freeze!
- It's okay, it's just me.

58:37.292 --> 58:38.792
I got one of them.

58:42.292 --> 58:44.875
- Who did the shooting?
- Noidea.

58:46.458 --> 58:47.957
Maybe him?

58:47.958 --> 58:49.250
It wasn't me.

58:49.583 --> 58:50.917
It was the pilot!

58:51.792 --> 58:53.250
The red one!

58:55.000 --> 58:56.417
I'll show you.

59:53.208 --> 59:54.292
You hear that?

59:55.375 --> 59:56.625
That's our troops.

59:57.708 --> 59:59.167
They're not far off.

01:00:01.125 --> 01:00:02.292
Just hang in there.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.500
It'll get dark soon.

01:02:12.083 --> 01:02:15.083
- Check out those fireworks!
- Got any more smokes?

01:02:19.042 --> 01:02:20.250
Yermek!

01:02:22.125 --> 01:02:23.666
What you got?

01:02:23.667 --> 01:02:25.833
Something's crawling our way, sarge.

01:02:26.167 --> 01:02:29.041
Could be a German
or some animal, not sure.

01:02:29.042 --> 01:02:31.292
Maybe it's an alligator?

01:02:44.875 --> 01:02:46.042
What are you waiting for?

01:02:46.875 --> 01:02:49.917
- Go check. Take philippov with you.
- Yes, sir.

01:03:17.958 --> 01:03:19.125
What is it

01:03:19.958 --> 01:03:21.125
noidea.

01:03:22.250 --> 01:03:24.375
Maybe an animal, maybe a German...

01:03:37.583 --> 01:03:40.333
They're our boys, sarge.

01:03:47.542 --> 01:03:49.667
Come on, help him in.

01:03:51.917 --> 01:03:54.042
Okay, here we go... grab him.

01:03:55.458 --> 01:03:58.417
- He's not dead, is he?
- He's breathing.

01:04:03.250 --> 01:04:04.707
We made it.

01:04:04.708 --> 01:04:06.958
Get on in, buddy.

01:04:10.167 --> 01:04:12.750
I told you we'd make it.

01:04:15.333 --> 01:04:17.167
Okay, careful now.

01:04:18.792 --> 01:04:20.083
We need a medic here!

01:04:21.667 --> 01:04:23.417
It's too late...

01:04:33.208 --> 01:04:34.457
Captain komlev, pilot.

01:04:34.458 --> 01:04:39.541
Gangrene in both ankles,
gunshot wound to the right shin,

01:04:39.542 --> 01:04:41.167
laceration to the forearm.

01:04:41.250 --> 01:04:44.249
Double pneumonia,
partial soft-tissue frostbite.

01:04:44.250 --> 01:04:46.125
- Is that everything?
- Yes.

01:04:46.583 --> 01:04:50.667
So you're taking me to an autopsy?
I'm a surgeon, not a pathologist.

01:04:51.542 --> 01:04:53.124
His heart's beating just fine.

01:04:53.125 --> 01:04:57.875
Well, mine's going to give out soon.
I can't stand watching them die on me.

01:05:26.750 --> 01:05:28.375
You awake, buddy?

01:05:29.917 --> 01:05:31.875
- Water...
- What?

01:05:33.875 --> 01:05:35.082
Water.

01:05:35.083 --> 01:05:37.292
Are you allowed water?
What did the doctors say?

01:05:42.250 --> 01:05:43.500
Okay, just a second.

01:05:52.208 --> 01:05:53.333
You're awake?

01:05:55.083 --> 01:05:56.083
Yes.

01:05:57.542 --> 01:05:58.958
My legs hurt.

01:06:06.375 --> 01:06:07.542
Nurse!

01:06:16.958 --> 01:06:19.791
- Can I get a shot?
- No, honey. You have to wait a little.

01:06:19.792 --> 01:06:20.792
Nurse!

01:06:25.875 --> 01:06:28.917
You got to... tough it out, you know.

01:06:30.625 --> 01:06:31.917
My arm... was also...

01:06:32.542 --> 01:06:36.167
On fire at first.

01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:41.625
I thought to myself, why the burning?
It's gone.

01:07:00.333 --> 01:07:02.292
Fuck this war, right, buddy?

01:07:03.167 --> 01:07:07.292
But look at it this way,
you could have died, but you didn't.

01:07:09.083 --> 01:07:12.917
It's like a second chance, a second life.

01:07:20.292 --> 01:07:22.208
Everything will be alright.

01:07:23.917 --> 01:07:26.208
Time's a great healer.

01:07:36.375 --> 01:07:38.375
Nikolay komlev

01:07:40.625 --> 01:07:42.708
saratov orphanage.

01:08:22.250 --> 01:08:23.457
Nikolay!

01:08:46.207 --> 01:08:47.791
Petrovich is here.

01:08:47.792 --> 01:08:49.457
- Kadkov!
- Over here!

01:08:50.542 --> 01:08:52.207
- Kolmykov!
- Here!

01:08:54.792 --> 01:08:55.916
Yevseev!

01:08:55.917 --> 01:08:58.667
He's dead. Three days ago.

01:08:59.125 --> 01:09:00.792
- Dzhamaliev!
- That's me.

01:09:01.667 --> 01:09:03.916
- Zakharov!
- Here!

01:09:03.917 --> 01:09:06.082
That's all, comrades. No more for today.

01:09:06.082 --> 01:09:06.957
Let me help.

01:09:06.959 --> 01:09:08.957
Bring the wounded over here.

01:09:08.957 --> 01:09:10.041
Who's wounded?

01:09:10.042 --> 01:09:12.750
Bring him in here. He's bleeding.

01:09:13.082 --> 01:09:14.332
Come on, let's go.

01:09:14.457 --> 01:09:18.082
The Hitler gang's reckless politics
are costing the Germans

01:09:18.082 --> 01:09:22.499
millions of lives
on the Soviet-German front.

01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:24.207
Millions? Really?

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:07.583
Olga, my love

01:10:07.625 --> 01:10:13.500
air raid shelter

01:10:50.375 --> 01:10:53.208
Silva

01:11:34.208 --> 01:11:35.875
These are for you.

01:11:36.750 --> 01:11:38.958
The doctor will help you try them on.

01:11:40.958 --> 01:11:44.083
The concert's starting soon.
Nechayeva's arrived.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.250
She's incredible.

01:11:47.208 --> 01:11:49.208
Do you want me to take you?

01:11:52.292 --> 01:11:53.374
Welcome, comrades!

01:11:53.375 --> 01:11:55.583
All right, I have to go.

01:11:56.333 --> 01:12:00.832
Today, our principal ensemble
from the Moscow theater

01:12:00.833 --> 01:12:03.957
will perform a patronage concert for you.

01:12:03.958 --> 01:12:08.417
To open, we present to you
the renowned performer,

01:12:09.083 --> 01:12:11.917
honored artist of the republic,

01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:16.957
and multiple laureate nadezhda nechayeva!

01:12:16.958 --> 01:12:20.124
Accompanied by our theater's artists

01:12:20.125 --> 01:12:24.374
lidiya maksimova and Olga goncharova.

01:12:24.375 --> 01:12:26.042
Please welcome them!

01:12:30.417 --> 01:12:31.583
Thank you.

01:12:34.875 --> 01:12:37.750
Comrades! My dear friends.

01:12:38.625 --> 01:12:40.749
I'd like to begin today's concert

01:12:40.750 --> 01:12:44.041
with a song to the music of matvienko.
Lyrics by andreyev.

01:12:44.042 --> 01:12:47.500
"You and I are predestined to meet again."

01:13:03.708 --> 01:13:10.541
You and I share this heartfelt conviction

01:13:10.542 --> 01:13:17.374
I feel certain inside that it's true

01:13:17.375 --> 01:13:23.500
you and I are predestined to meet again

01:13:25.125 --> 01:13:30.208
just as soon as this long war is through

01:13:31.792 --> 01:13:38.874
you and I are predestined to meet again

01:13:38.875 --> 01:13:45.375
just as soon as this long war is through

01:13:46.208 --> 01:13:51.708
the wounded night sky
will heal when the dawn arrives

01:13:52.792 --> 01:13:59.792
we'll be shielded from bullets by fate

01:13:59.875 --> 01:14:06.875
you and I are predestined to meet again

01:14:06.958 --> 01:14:13.417
how my heart overflows as I wait!

01:14:14.208 --> 01:14:19.625
Though parting is such terrible misery

01:14:21.417 --> 01:14:26.417
as our own native land lies ablaze

01:14:28.375 --> 01:14:29.999
- what's the matter?
- What?

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:34.417
You and I are predestined to meet again

01:14:36.833 --> 01:14:39.833
why didn't you write that you were coming?

01:14:47.292 --> 01:14:49.417
You have no idea
how hard it is just waiting.

01:14:59.708 --> 01:15:01.333
What's the matter?

01:15:06.083 --> 01:15:08.042
Promise me you'll come back.

01:15:08.625 --> 01:15:09.792
Swear it.

01:15:11.083 --> 01:15:17.749
You and I are predestined to meet again

01:15:17.750 --> 01:15:24.749
victory shines through war's dreadful haze

01:15:24.750 --> 01:15:30.917
have no fear
this will all soon have been and gone

01:15:31.833 --> 01:15:38.500
though to triumph
there's a hard road to hew

01:15:38.958 --> 01:15:45.999
you and I are predestined to meet again

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:52.083
just as soon as this long war is through

01:15:53.208 --> 01:16:00.207
you and I are predestined to meet again

01:16:00.208 --> 01:16:07.083
just as soon as this long war is through

01:16:08.250 --> 01:16:10.749
thank you, comrades!
And a speedy recovery!

01:16:10.750 --> 01:16:14.167
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

01:16:17.500 --> 01:16:19.458
Oh, it's you...

01:16:20.375 --> 01:16:24.582
I've seen all of her movies.
She's amazing, isn't she?

01:16:24.583 --> 01:16:28.166
You know, I have a dream.
I want to see nadezhda on the stage.

01:16:28.167 --> 01:16:31.291
In a real theater. I'm valya, by the way.

01:16:31.292 --> 01:16:32.917
- Lidiya.
- Olga.

01:16:33.417 --> 01:16:35.374
- Come see us!
- Are you sure?

01:16:35.375 --> 01:16:36.458
Of course.

01:16:45.458 --> 01:16:46.583
And there we go.

01:18:33.917 --> 01:18:35.125
You've overreached yourself.

01:18:36.042 --> 01:18:37.957
Your wounds will open up and...

01:18:37.958 --> 01:18:39.832
And it will all go to waste.

01:18:39.833 --> 01:18:41.624
No getting up for a week.

01:18:41.625 --> 01:18:43.125
Take the prostheses to my office.

01:18:48.750 --> 01:18:50.583
Overall though, not bad at all.

01:18:51.042 --> 01:18:53.792
You'll probably be walking faster
than me soon.

01:18:55.083 --> 01:18:56.583
Will I be able to fly, doctor?

01:18:58.375 --> 01:18:59.458
I doubt it.

01:19:00.792 --> 01:19:03.582
Although, I heard
about an English pilot like you...

01:19:03.583 --> 01:19:05.500
They say he flies with prosthetics.

01:19:06.167 --> 01:19:07.374
Really?

01:19:07.375 --> 01:19:09.666
Well, the English don't report to me.

01:19:09.667 --> 01:19:11.542
Maybe he does, maybe he doesn't.

01:19:14.125 --> 01:19:15.250
I will.

01:19:17.917 --> 01:19:18.917
N. Komlev

01:20:47.542 --> 01:20:49.332
Thanks so much for the tickets!

01:20:49.333 --> 01:20:52.457
I haven't been to the theater
since before the war.

01:20:52.458 --> 01:20:54.833
You know, I was in drama club at school.

01:21:20.417 --> 01:21:21.833
Hello.

01:21:25.125 --> 01:21:26.458
Do you know each other?

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.625
I brought free tickets to the theater.

01:21:35.500 --> 01:21:36.708
And you're here...

01:21:38.917 --> 01:21:40.167
So you're alive...

01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:45.875
But then why...

01:21:48.458 --> 01:21:50.458
I don't know how to say it, Olga.

01:21:54.708 --> 01:21:56.041
I'd better go.

01:21:56.042 --> 01:21:58.249
We lost a tanker in August.

01:21:58.250 --> 01:21:59.792
Goodbye, nikolay.

01:22:00.292 --> 01:22:05.375
They operated three times. Such a shame,
he didn't make it to summer in the end.

01:22:05.667 --> 01:22:08.916
You know, captain komlev
wants to play football soon...

01:22:08.917 --> 01:22:11.375
- On his prosthetic legs.
- Prosthetic legs?

01:22:12.042 --> 01:22:14.417
- He lost his legs?
- Well, yes.

01:22:14.750 --> 01:22:17.333
I amputated them myself in the winter.

01:22:17.875 --> 01:22:19.167
You've got to be kidding.

01:23:03.542 --> 01:23:04.750
How did it go?

01:23:05.458 --> 01:23:06.708
I've been discharged.

01:23:07.750 --> 01:23:09.125
It's okay.

01:23:09.583 --> 01:23:11.143
I'll go all the way to kalinin himself.

01:23:34.833 --> 01:23:36.417
- What is this?
- What?

01:23:46.583 --> 01:23:48.792
"Dear mom and dad,

01:23:53.833 --> 01:23:55.458
I'm doing all right.

01:23:56.917 --> 01:24:00.792
Dad, I'm performing surgeries
on my own now."

01:24:01.083 --> 01:24:07.041
As a general and a big man in medicine,
I hope you're proud to know that.

01:24:07.042 --> 01:24:09.249
I even took an appendix out.

01:24:09.250 --> 01:24:13.166
Imagine that,
appendicitis happens in war too.

01:24:13.167 --> 01:24:16.458
Some catch bullets,
some catch appendicitis.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:18.457
It's odd.

01:24:18.458 --> 01:24:20.875
This whole war is a paradox.

01:24:21.542 --> 01:24:23.833
I've got a wounded pilot here with me.

01:24:24.333 --> 01:24:27.874
Medically speaking,
he should have been dead a while ago.

01:24:27.875 --> 01:24:29.125
But he's alive.

01:24:29.875 --> 01:24:33.083
The two of us are here
and we're both alive.

01:24:34.208 --> 01:24:35.292
What's next?

01:24:35.792 --> 01:24:37.917
I try not to think about that.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:40.999
The two of us are here

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:42.250
and we're both alive.

01:24:43.042 --> 01:24:44.750
"What's next?

01:24:46.792 --> 01:24:52.042
I try not to think about that.
The war does its job and I do mine.

01:24:52.667 --> 01:24:58.375
Once I'm transferred.
I'll send you the new unit ID code.

01:24:59.167 --> 01:25:01.208
I miss you a lot.

01:25:04.458 --> 01:25:06.083
Yours, Misha."

01:25:13.583 --> 01:25:14.917
To be honest...

01:25:16.083 --> 01:25:18.208
I can't picture him in uniform.

01:25:19.833 --> 01:25:22.292
And there are no photographs.

01:25:36.750 --> 01:25:38.458
Permission to speak?

01:25:39.458 --> 01:25:40.833
Divisional military doctor, sir?

01:25:44.833 --> 01:25:46.542
Permission granted.

01:25:48.625 --> 01:25:50.250
Are you out of your mind?

01:25:50.750 --> 01:25:52.708
How are you going to fly? How?

01:25:53.375 --> 01:25:54.875
You can't even walk without a cane.

01:25:55.833 --> 01:25:57.875
And you want to fly.
It's out of the question.

01:25:58.625 --> 01:26:00.582
It's entirely impossible!

01:26:00.583 --> 01:26:02.667
The English pilot Douglas bader
kept on flying.

01:26:03.083 --> 01:26:05.749
The exception only proves the rule.

01:26:05.750 --> 01:26:09.375
Yes, but this exception can fight
and shoot down German planes.

01:26:14.833 --> 01:26:16.208
Misha saved you

01:26:17.708 --> 01:26:18.958
so that you could live.

01:26:20.792 --> 01:26:22.000
You must live on.

01:26:27.750 --> 01:26:29.083
Live along life.

01:26:31.833 --> 01:26:33.417
A life has to be worth living.

01:26:39.667 --> 01:26:41.387
When I was crawling down there
in the woods,

01:26:43.458 --> 01:26:45.958
I wanted to live so that I could fight.

01:26:46.583 --> 01:26:48.208
Defeat the Nazis.

01:26:48.708 --> 01:26:50.625
For my partner shota.

01:26:51.292 --> 01:26:52.667
For your son.

01:26:55.417 --> 01:26:56.417
For her.

01:27:01.542 --> 01:27:03.042
Why don't you say something?

01:27:03.583 --> 01:27:05.333
Surely you must understand.

01:27:06.042 --> 01:27:07.333
My husband's a pilot.

01:27:07.875 --> 01:27:09.625
And a pilot has to fly.

01:27:13.875 --> 01:27:16.125
Now wait, come on, really.

01:27:16.875 --> 01:27:18.542
Captain!

01:27:27.667 --> 01:27:28.833
- Halt!
- Seventh!

01:27:28.958 --> 01:27:30.125
Attention!

01:27:40.333 --> 01:27:42.749
Good morning, major!

01:27:42.750 --> 01:27:46.417
- Is the yak-9 ready?
- They didn't send any oil coolers.

01:27:46.917 --> 01:27:49.958
- Did you go to the division?
- It's been crazy here, sir.

01:27:50.667 --> 01:27:51.917
I didn't have time.

01:27:53.667 --> 01:27:54.917
Didn't have time?

01:27:56.750 --> 01:27:58.166
And time to drink?

01:27:58.167 --> 01:28:01.416
The yak isn't ready,
but you had time for booze?

01:28:01.417 --> 01:28:02.958
It wasn't for fun, sir.

01:28:03.167 --> 01:28:05.916
I was up all night checking
the engines were warm.

01:28:05.917 --> 01:28:07.957
I was so cold, I had to warm up.

01:28:07.958 --> 01:28:11.082
Look, get to the division,
do whatever it takes,

01:28:11.083 --> 01:28:15.375
cry, beg, I don't care.
But have that yak ready by tonight!

01:28:22.833 --> 01:28:25.000
- Understood?
- Yes sir, understood.

01:28:27.667 --> 01:28:29.208
Good morning, major!

01:28:31.875 --> 01:28:33.791
Listening to romantic songs, are we?

01:28:33.792 --> 01:28:36.208
No, sir. Radio chatter.

01:28:36.542 --> 01:28:38.250
Sounds like a pincer movement.

01:28:38.958 --> 01:28:41.582
- Who's caught in it?
- A pilot and a gunner.

01:28:41.583 --> 01:28:44.083
- Sounds like an ii-2, I think.
- "I think"?

01:28:44.542 --> 01:28:46.666
Well, don't go thinking too hard there.

01:28:46.667 --> 01:28:50.583
Probably from the third assault
regiment, sir. Twenty kilometers away.

01:29:09.208 --> 01:29:10.792
There they are!

01:29:17.292 --> 01:29:18.708
I've been hit!

01:29:29.125 --> 01:29:32.542
- Can you see the messer?
- One's turning, coming in on our 6!

01:29:32.958 --> 01:29:36.207
Sir, ammo's running low,
two reloads and we're out.

01:29:36.208 --> 01:29:37.667
Let's get out of here!

01:29:38.667 --> 01:29:39.958
The messer's close.

01:29:40.625 --> 01:29:43.291
The guys are dead!
The plane's as good as gone!

01:29:43.292 --> 01:29:46.000
- We're done for!
- Get reinforcements up there!

01:29:49.875 --> 01:29:51.083
Start the engine!

01:30:28.333 --> 01:30:30.042
Captain, I've got no ammo!

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.250
Did you hear me? I'm out!

01:31:14.125 --> 01:31:16.875
We're in the hot zone, sir.
There's nobody here.

01:31:20.292 --> 01:31:21.875
Resuming our search.

01:31:22.500 --> 01:31:24.292
We'll find them.

01:31:52.583 --> 01:31:54.208
Looks like we lost them.

01:32:08.042 --> 01:32:09.500
There's the bridge.

01:32:09.750 --> 01:32:12.332
We've still got two missiles, we can try.

01:32:12.333 --> 01:32:14.582
Are you crazy? Let's get out of here!

01:32:14.583 --> 01:32:18.333
Those weren't my orders.
I was ordered to destroy the bridge.

01:32:43.750 --> 01:32:45.417
There's a messer on our tail!

01:33:59.167 --> 01:34:00.458
There they are.

01:34:45.458 --> 01:34:47.042
How the hell about that!

01:35:37.375 --> 01:35:39.208
Number five, it's number one.

01:35:40.208 --> 01:35:41.917
We 're coming home.

01:38:06.750 --> 01:38:10.000
Oh, I see. He's wasted.

01:38:12.708 --> 01:38:14.000
No, he isn't.

01:38:15.542 --> 01:38:18.458
You think I'm blind?
He can barely stand on his feet!

01:38:20.458 --> 01:38:21.875
He hasn't got any.

01:38:23.292 --> 01:38:24.625
Those are prosthetic legs.
