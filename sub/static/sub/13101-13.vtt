WEBVTT

00:01.667 --> 00:04.042
[instrumental music]

00:07.292 --> 00:09.458
[indistinct chattering]

00:09.542 --> 00:14.792
Yeah.

00:14.875 --> 00:15.917
[murmuring]

00:16.000 --> 00:16.958
[indistinct chattering]

00:17.042 --> 00:19.792
Good morning, captain.

00:19.875 --> 00:21.250
- 'Oh, goodness.'
- Hm.

00:21.333 --> 00:22.708
Top of the morning, captain.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.250
- Captain.
- Morning.

00:29.292 --> 00:30.375
[Zack clearing throat]

00:30.458 --> 00:33.333
So, captain, Ivanova tells me

00:33.417 --> 00:36.417
you convinced Londo and G'Kar
to go along with your idea

00:36.500 --> 00:38.667
about putting White Star ships
along their borders

00:38.750 --> 00:40.208
as a peacekeeping force.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.000
Hm.

00:43.083 --> 00:44.125
[mumbling]

00:44.208 --> 00:46.833
- Maybe we shouldn't.
- I agree.

00:46.917 --> 00:50.875
Well, anyway, it's good news,
but it's gonna be tough

00:50.958 --> 00:54.083
to get the other aligned worlds
to go along with it.

00:54.167 --> 00:55.958
- Got any salt over there?
- Yeah, here.

00:56.042 --> 00:57.625
Yeah, I know,
every time you try to get them

00:57.708 --> 00:59.333
to do something for their own
good they figure that

00:59.417 --> 01:02.333
you've got some sort of
a hidden agenda.

01:02.417 --> 01:04.625
'And getting legal authority
from each of them'

01:04.708 --> 01:06.708
'to make arrests? Not a chance.'

01:06.792 --> 01:07.958
(Stephen)
Such a pain in the ass.

01:08.042 --> 01:09.417
It's like every four months

01:09.500 --> 01:10.958
we've gotta start
all over again.

01:11.042 --> 01:13.958
[John laughing]

01:19.583 --> 01:21.625
Oh, sorry. Nothing.

01:24.542 --> 01:26.292
No, you're right, Zack, I mean,
getting them all on board

01:26.375 --> 01:27.375
is gonna be a hard sell.

01:27.458 --> 01:28.958
You know, for most of them

01:29.042 --> 01:30.792
'the Raiders and the Drakh
are just potential problems.'

01:30.875 --> 01:33.583
'I mean, they really haven't
hit that many places so far.'

01:33.667 --> 01:35.667
They don't see the trouble until
it's right up on top of them.

01:35.750 --> 01:37.250
And then they run around
like they're crazy.

01:37.333 --> 01:39.958
[laughing]

01:42.083 --> 01:43.958
[John laughing]

01:44.042 --> 01:45.167
Is there something you'd like to

01:45.250 --> 01:46.500
share with the rest of the
group?

01:46.583 --> 01:49.375
[laughing]
Huh?

01:49.458 --> 01:51.458
Uh, no. No, no.

01:52.417 --> 01:54.250
'No. Uh-uh.'

01:54.333 --> 01:56.875
Anyway, I hate to have
to go through this again

01:56.958 --> 01:59.250
but I think
we're stuck with him.

01:59.333 --> 02:02.125
That's it! I got it!

02:02.208 --> 02:04.292
Ha! It'll work.

02:04.375 --> 02:06.833
Okay, if we try
to talk the other races

02:06.917 --> 02:09.042
into letting our ships
operate along their borders

02:09.125 --> 02:10.708
it's gonna be nothing but grief!

02:10.792 --> 02:12.500
Hell, it took months to pull
them together the last time

02:12.583 --> 02:15.250
and that was with the Shadows
breathing down their necks.

02:15.333 --> 02:18.042
I don't wanna go through
that again any more than you.

02:18.125 --> 02:20.875
I am tired of doing things
the hard way.

02:20.958 --> 02:22.792
There's an easier way
to convince them!

02:22.875 --> 02:24.167
And how do we do that?

02:24.250 --> 02:25.917
- By not convincing them!
- Whoa!

02:26.000 --> 02:27.250
[laughing]

02:27.333 --> 02:30.208
Listen, Marcus, after you've
finished your breakfast

02:30.292 --> 02:34.167
I want you to take three
White Stars up to Sector 87

02:34.250 --> 02:35.917
and wait for orders.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.958
What do you want me to do?

02:38.958 --> 02:39.958
I don't know yet..

02:40.042 --> 02:41.208
[chuckling]

02:41.292 --> 02:43.958
...but trust me,
this is gonna be great!

02:44.042 --> 02:46.375
[laughing]

02:46.458 --> 02:49.042
[all laughing]

02:52.000 --> 02:53.125
Oh.

02:55.375 --> 02:56.917
- Just checking.
- 'Huh.'

02:57.000 --> 02:58.292
(Stephen)
'If this is the way he is'

02:58.375 --> 03:00.042
after Delenn's been gone
for three days

03:00.125 --> 03:01.625
I don't even wanna know
what he's gonna be like

03:01.708 --> 03:03.417
after another week.

03:03.500 --> 03:04.917
[all laughing]

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
[droning]

03:09.625 --> 03:13.500
Lennier, have you been able
to get through to home yet?

03:14.500 --> 03:16.250
It's been difficult.

03:16.333 --> 03:19.417
It seems the primary beacon
is no longer transmitting.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.292
I've had to use
the orbital relay station

03:21.375 --> 03:24.083
to pick up
on local broadcasts, but..

03:24.167 --> 03:27.500
Delenn, fighting has broken out
in the capital.

03:27.583 --> 03:30.125
They fear it may spread
to the outer cities.

03:30.208 --> 03:33.042
- A civil war?
- Yes.

03:33.708 --> 03:35.333
It's started.

03:37.917 --> 03:40.708
[instrumental music]

03:40.792 --> 03:42.292
(Lennier)
It was the year of fire.

03:42.375 --> 03:44.750
(Zack)
The year of destruction.

03:44.833 --> 03:47.500
(G'kar)
The year we took back
what was ours.

03:47.583 --> 03:49.458
(Lyta)
It was the year of rebirth.

03:49.542 --> 03:51.833
(Vir)
The year of great sadness.

03:51.917 --> 03:53.375
(Marcus)
The year of pain.

03:53.458 --> 03:55.125
(Delenn)
And a year of joy.

03:55.208 --> 03:56.583
(Londo)
It was a new age.

03:56.667 --> 03:58.708
(Franklin)
It was the end of history.

03:58.792 --> 04:01.500
(Ivanova)
It was the year
everything changed.

04:04.208 --> 04:08.292
(Garibaldi)
The year is 2261. The place..

04:08.375 --> 04:10.000
(Sheridan)
Babylon 5.

04:10.083 --> 04:13.167
[theme music]

04:40.083 --> 04:43.167
[music continues]

05:07.292 --> 05:09.792
[droning]

05:30.792 --> 05:33.458
When I was a child..

05:33.542 --> 05:35.708
...my father used to carry me
through the city

05:35.792 --> 05:37.333
on his shoulders.

05:39.167 --> 05:41.375
I had never seen such beauty.

05:42.667 --> 05:45.000
The city was eternal.

05:45.083 --> 05:47.083
It's beauty is eternal.

05:48.833 --> 05:51.083
We heard of the Grey Council.

05:51.167 --> 05:54.333
The name was always spoken
with awe and reverence.

05:55.667 --> 05:58.500
They held our world together.

05:58.583 --> 06:01.542
They were the peace
promised by Valen.

06:02.833 --> 06:05.625
Thousand years of peace

06:05.708 --> 06:07.750
among the three castes.

06:12.042 --> 06:14.833
I think of my beautiful city
in flames, Lennier.

06:17.542 --> 06:19.667
The streets where I walked..

06:20.958 --> 06:22.625
...the temples..

06:24.208 --> 06:26.750
...the great crystal spires

06:26.833 --> 06:28.625
that sighed music

06:28.708 --> 06:30.917
whenever the wind touched them.

06:32.750 --> 06:35.417
I think of it..

06:35.500 --> 06:37.750
...and I cry, Lennier.

06:40.958 --> 06:42.250
And I wonder..

06:43.875 --> 06:45.917
..."Did I do this

06:46.000 --> 06:48.792
when I broke the Grey Council?"

06:48.875 --> 06:51.542
Valen always said
the council will be broken

06:51.625 --> 06:53.625
in the great Shadow War.

06:53.708 --> 06:55.542
Lennier.

06:55.625 --> 06:58.750
You know the truth
as well as I do.

06:58.833 --> 07:01.375
Valen only knew
what Sinclair knew.

07:01.458 --> 07:04.083
'He couldn't see beyond that.'

07:04.167 --> 07:07.833
Once he left us,
the future became fluid.

07:10.208 --> 07:12.000
I had assumed

07:12.083 --> 07:14.000
that things would continue on

07:14.083 --> 07:17.292
like some
great clockwork mechanism

07:17.375 --> 07:19.667
as long as the war was won..

07:19.750 --> 07:22.000
...we would be alright.

07:23.500 --> 07:25.167
I was wrong.

07:25.250 --> 07:28.000
Delenn, it was inevitable.

07:28.083 --> 07:30.625
The council imposed balance
between the castes

07:30.708 --> 07:32.667
by suppressing
the old resentments

07:32.750 --> 07:35.125
the fears, the imagined slights

07:35.208 --> 07:36.917
but it could not erase them.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.417
Take that away

07:38.500 --> 07:41.875
and all the old problems come
right back to the surface again.

07:41.958 --> 07:43.292
Perhaps.

07:45.292 --> 07:47.542
We have to stop this, Lennier.

07:47.625 --> 07:49.792
If the fighting spreads
beyond the capital

07:49.875 --> 07:51.542
a thousand years of peace

07:51.625 --> 07:53.708
will become
a thousand years of war.

07:53.792 --> 07:54.958
I came here to tell you

07:55.042 --> 07:57.000
the Takari
has received our signal

07:57.083 --> 07:58.542
they're waiting for us
point.

07:58.625 --> 08:00.292
We'll be there within the hour.

08:00.375 --> 08:03.000
Did you contact Neroon?

08:03.083 --> 08:04.542
Yes, I did.

08:04.625 --> 08:08.500
Whether or not he will be there
when we arrive, I do not know.

08:21.292 --> 08:24.875
It was a...a beautiful city

08:24.958 --> 08:26.417
wasn't it?

08:33.958 --> 08:36.875
(Londo)
Captain, I'm not entirely sure
I understand.

08:36.958 --> 08:39.250
When you asked me
to allow your ships

08:39.333 --> 08:41.792
to operate on the border
of Centauri space

08:41.875 --> 08:43.333
you said you were
going to use it

08:43.417 --> 08:45.542
to inspire the rest
of the League to do the same.

08:45.625 --> 08:46.667
- Hm?
- That's right.

08:46.750 --> 08:48.375
And now you don't,
you don't want me

08:48.458 --> 08:49.750
to even talk about it?

08:49.833 --> 08:51.417
That's right,
and if anyone brings it up

08:51.500 --> 08:53.083
I want you to deny it.

08:53.167 --> 08:55.667
- Deny it?
- That's right.

08:55.750 --> 08:58.625
But you, you want to keep
the patrols in place, yes?

08:58.708 --> 09:01.917
Absolutely. And I've told G'Kar
the same thing.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.667
[chuckling]
Well, captain..

09:03.750 --> 09:06.375
You will forgive me
if I appear a bit slow.

09:06.458 --> 09:08.167
I have studied your race
quite a bit

09:08.250 --> 09:10.417
and there are still several
aspects of your psychology

09:10.500 --> 09:11.667
I don't understand.

09:11.750 --> 09:14.250
A place called
Winchester Mansion

09:14.333 --> 09:16.667
with stairs that go nowhere

09:16.750 --> 09:19.750
something called
Country and Western.

09:19.833 --> 09:22.542
And the less said
about the comedy team

09:22.625 --> 09:25.250
of Rebo and Zooty,
the better. However--

09:25.333 --> 09:26.792
(John)
'You don't like Rebo and Zooty?'

09:26.875 --> 09:29.292
[chuckling]
I mean, they're hysterical.

09:29.375 --> 09:31.458
Are they? I'm sorry.

09:31.542 --> 09:33.125
I apparently mistook you
for a human

09:33.208 --> 09:35.333
with some taste and sensibility.

09:35.417 --> 09:36.750
'After their last broadcast'

09:36.833 --> 09:38.292
'everywhere I went
on the station'

09:38.375 --> 09:41.208
someone was going,
"Zooty, zoot, zoot."

09:41.292 --> 09:42.458
That was a great routine.

09:42.542 --> 09:44.833
- I didn't get it.
- Not my problem.

09:44.917 --> 09:48.042
My point, if you will
allow me to make it

09:48.125 --> 09:49.750
is that there's much
about the human mind

09:49.833 --> 09:51.292
that I don't understand.

09:51.375 --> 09:53.958
So perhaps
you will explain to me

09:54.042 --> 09:55.542
how allowing your ships

09:55.625 --> 09:57.833
to patrol
the border of Centauri space

09:57.917 --> 10:00.958
will inspire the rest
of the League to do the same

10:01.042 --> 10:03.625
if I can't even tell them
that we are doing it!

10:03.708 --> 10:05.042
(John)
Londo!

10:06.250 --> 10:07.750
Trust me.

10:09.375 --> 10:10.625
[door whirring]

10:10.708 --> 10:12.292
[sighing]

10:12.375 --> 10:14.500
Zooty, zoot, zoot.

10:14.583 --> 10:16.333
[laughing]
I love that.

10:16.417 --> 10:17.500
[laughing]

10:24.500 --> 10:27.375
[instrumental music]

10:52.417 --> 10:55.167
- Hello, Neroon.
- Delenn.

10:55.250 --> 10:58.125
I was surprised
to receive your message.

10:58.208 --> 11:00.542
I considered not responding

11:00.625 --> 11:04.083
but then, I enjoy a mystery
as much as anyone.

11:04.167 --> 11:07.625
I am, however, very disappointed
in the welcome I received

11:07.708 --> 11:10.125
from your fellow
Religious caste.

11:10.208 --> 11:12.125
'For a moment I thought they
might actually'

11:12.208 --> 11:14.542
'fire on our ship.'

11:14.625 --> 11:16.375
You are under my protection.

11:16.458 --> 11:20.292
They will not harm you
except in their own defense.

11:20.375 --> 11:22.375
I need to speak with you..

11:23.208 --> 11:24.500
...alone.

11:24.583 --> 11:26.500
Given the fighting
that's going on back home

11:26.583 --> 11:29.208
I should think you would be
very worried to be alone

11:29.292 --> 11:31.083
with one of the Warrior caste.

11:31.167 --> 11:35.333
I would if it were
anyone else but you.

11:35.417 --> 11:36.875
And why is that?

11:36.958 --> 11:39.458
Come with me and find out.

11:47.833 --> 11:50.958
[instrumental music]

12:04.333 --> 12:06.917
Treating them
like honored guests

12:07.000 --> 12:09.417
after all they've done to us.

12:09.500 --> 12:10.917
What are they doing here?

12:11.000 --> 12:14.542
- Why were they invited?
- It is not for me to say.

12:14.625 --> 12:17.917
There are rumors
all over homeworld

12:18.000 --> 12:20.083
that the Religious caste
will give in

12:20.167 --> 12:22.125
to the demands of the Warriors

12:22.208 --> 12:25.958
that they will rule
and we will follow. Delenn..

12:26.042 --> 12:27.583
Will speak for herself

12:27.667 --> 12:29.833
when she feels
it is correct to speak.

12:47.917 --> 12:50.500
Alright, Delenn. What is it?

12:52.042 --> 12:55.208
- I need your help, Neroon.
- 'My help?'

12:55.292 --> 12:56.917
I remind you
that not very long ago

12:57.000 --> 12:59.833
I fought to keep you from
taking control of the Rangers.

12:59.917 --> 13:02.792
We have not exactly
been friends.

13:02.875 --> 13:06.000
No, but your actions
have always been motivated

13:06.083 --> 13:07.417
by one desire

13:07.500 --> 13:09.917
to do what is right
for our people.

13:11.750 --> 13:15.333
The Warrior caste cannot
be allowed to win this war.

13:15.417 --> 13:17.958
The Religious caste
cannot be allowed to win.

13:18.042 --> 13:19.375
You know as well as I

13:19.458 --> 13:21.208
that if either side
achieves dominance

13:21.292 --> 13:24.375
the delicate balance of our
civilization will be destroyed.

13:24.458 --> 13:25.625
You should have thought of that

13:25.708 --> 13:28.625
before you broke
the Grey Council.

13:28.708 --> 13:31.042
What is done is done, Neroon.

13:31.125 --> 13:33.708
What matters now is the future.

13:33.792 --> 13:36.292
Yes, we have disagreed,
even fought

13:36.375 --> 13:38.500
but I would rather have someone
who opposed me

13:38.583 --> 13:41.875
out of an honest belief
in the rightness of his cause

13:41.958 --> 13:43.542
than someone
who was always on my side

13:43.625 --> 13:46.167
because it was expected,
required.

13:47.458 --> 13:49.667
I've questioned your judgment,
your wisdom

13:49.750 --> 13:52.667
your temperament,
but never your loyalty.

13:53.958 --> 13:57.333
- Was that a compliment?
- After a fashion.

13:58.542 --> 14:00.958
Then you trust me?

14:01.042 --> 14:02.167
After a fashion.

14:03.833 --> 14:06.625
Well, it's a beginning.

14:08.167 --> 14:10.583
I only wish it could have
happened months ago.

14:11.958 --> 14:13.917
We might have avoided
all this grief.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.750
- Now it's too late.
- No, it's not.

14:16.833 --> 14:19.250
This has been building
ever since the war.

14:19.333 --> 14:20.875
The fire cannot be stopped.

14:20.958 --> 14:22.250
It will have to burn itself out

14:22.333 --> 14:24.167
before the two sides
will listen to reason.

14:24.250 --> 14:27.250
And how many cities will be
burned to the ground by then?

14:27.333 --> 14:28.875
How many lives will be lost?

14:28.958 --> 14:30.667
Delenn, I am as horrified

14:30.750 --> 14:33.417
by what is happening back home
as you are

14:33.500 --> 14:37.250
but we are two
against a world gone mad.

14:37.333 --> 14:38.917
What can we do against that?

14:39.000 --> 14:39.958
(Delenn)
'Nothing..'

14:40.042 --> 14:42.375
...until we get
their attention.

14:42.458 --> 14:44.792
For that I need your help.

14:44.875 --> 14:46.375
Will you give it?

14:48.208 --> 14:50.792
If I do, I risk alienating
my entire caste.

14:50.875 --> 14:53.792
- They may turn against me.
- 'That is true.'

14:53.875 --> 14:56.208
And I risk the same
by working with you.

14:57.625 --> 14:59.833
Well..

14:59.917 --> 15:01.750
...it's a challenge

15:01.833 --> 15:05.042
and I have
always liked challenges.

15:06.542 --> 15:09.167
You have my support for now.

15:10.542 --> 15:13.333
[instrumental music]

15:25.083 --> 15:26.167
(Drazi)
Captain, I must speak to you.

15:26.250 --> 15:27.833
I'm in kind of a hurry,
ambassador.

15:27.917 --> 15:30.042
Some of our ships returning
from a training expedition

15:30.125 --> 15:31.708
to Centauri Prime have reported

15:31.792 --> 15:34.417
seeing several
of your White Star ships

15:34.500 --> 15:36.208
patrolling the borders
of Centauri space.

15:36.292 --> 15:37.875
- Have they?
- Well, did you put them there?

15:37.958 --> 15:39.708
(Drazi)
Or did the Centauri
ask for them?

15:39.792 --> 15:42.208
I don't really think
it's my place to comment.

15:42.292 --> 15:43.292
Captain!

15:43.375 --> 15:44.875
All I can say is

15:44.958 --> 15:47.333
we certainly wouldn't be there
if we weren't wanted.

15:47.417 --> 15:51.000
- Then they asked for the ships?
- I can't confirm that.

15:51.083 --> 15:53.000
(Drazi)
'But you're not
denying it, either.'

15:53.083 --> 15:54.500
But not denying it
doesn't make it true

15:54.583 --> 15:57.083
any more than not confirming it
makes it false.

15:57.167 --> 15:59.625
- 'Are you with me so far?'
- I am not sure.

15:59.708 --> 16:03.458
Ambassador, there are so many
things in the universe that are

16:03.542 --> 16:04.833
and so many things that aren't.

16:04.917 --> 16:06.125
If I were to take the time

16:06.208 --> 16:08.833
to deny all the things
that aren't, uh

16:08.917 --> 16:12.042
we'd be here for centuries,
wouldn't we, huh?

16:12.125 --> 16:14.125
Well, I got to go.

16:14.208 --> 16:15.500
[indistinct chattering]

16:15.583 --> 16:18.583
Captain, the Centauri
are a prideful people.

16:18.667 --> 16:20.083
They wouldn't ask for help
unless they were

16:20.167 --> 16:21.500
afraid of something.

16:21.583 --> 16:24.875
If that's true,
we deserve to know what it is!

16:24.958 --> 16:27.875
I'm sorry. I can't say any more.

16:27.958 --> 16:30.333
Now, if you would,
please, excuse me.

16:32.167 --> 16:33.625
[sighing]

16:33.708 --> 16:36.708
[indistinct chattering]

16:38.208 --> 16:40.375
Captain, we've got Marcus
standing by on channel 4.

16:40.458 --> 16:41.542
Put him through.

16:44.542 --> 16:47.875
- Marcus, you're in position.
- I got here a little while ago.

16:47.958 --> 16:50.208
We've scanned the area,
but, uh, there's nothing here.

16:50.292 --> 16:52.708
- Just a bunch of asteroids.
- Good.

16:52.792 --> 16:54.417
I want you to target
several of the asteroids

16:54.500 --> 16:55.625
and destroy them.

16:55.708 --> 16:58.458
- I see. And then?
- Then come back.

16:58.542 --> 17:00.417
- That's it?
- 'Yes.'

17:00.500 --> 17:03.167
Shoot a bunch of rocks
and then leave?

17:03.250 --> 17:06.333
- Correct.
- 'Hm.'

17:06.417 --> 17:08.917
- Captain, may I ask--
- 'You may not.'

17:09.000 --> 17:11.083
You have your orders,
and I have neither the desire

17:11.167 --> 17:14.000
nor the inclination
to explain them to you.

17:14.083 --> 17:17.083
Now, if you're incapable of
carrying them out, let me know.

17:17.167 --> 17:18.333
Otherwise I'll expect to see you

17:18.417 --> 17:20.083
when you've completed
your mission.

17:20.167 --> 17:22.542
Understood.

17:22.625 --> 17:24.125
- Uh, captain?
- Hm?

17:24.208 --> 17:25.917
Is everything alright?

17:26.000 --> 17:27.292
Uh, fine, excellent.

17:27.375 --> 17:28.667
Uh, couldn't be finer. Why?

17:28.750 --> 17:31.417
Well, that was just
kind of a unusual order.

17:32.542 --> 17:33.458
- Huh.
- Yes.

17:33.542 --> 17:36.625
Yes, it is, isn't it? Hm.

17:36.708 --> 17:37.958
Oh, uh, which reminds me

17:38.042 --> 17:39.708
when does the, uh,
"Voice Of Resistance"

17:39.792 --> 17:41.167
make her next broadcast?

17:41.250 --> 17:44.042
- 8 o'clock. Why?
- Oh, nothing, nothing.

17:44.125 --> 17:46.458
Um, I was just planning
on coming by

17:46.542 --> 17:48.125
and see how things were going.

17:48.208 --> 17:50.125
Uh, everything else here
alright?

17:50.208 --> 17:51.958
- Fine. Fine.
- Good.

17:52.042 --> 17:53.292
Well, I'll leave you to it.

17:53.375 --> 17:55.792
I have to stop by Medlab,
talk to Stephen.

17:55.875 --> 17:58.417
There's something I have
for him to do, as well.

17:58.500 --> 18:00.000
[chuckling]

18:00.083 --> 18:02.250
- Good day, commander.
- Captain.

18:03.958 --> 18:07.875
I told you I have no idea
what you are talking about.

18:07.958 --> 18:09.500
(Drazi)
These White Star ships

18:09.583 --> 18:12.875
were seen on your borders,
ambassador! Our pilots--

18:12.958 --> 18:16.667
Your pilots, your pilots should
have their eyes examined.

18:16.750 --> 18:19.125
I don't know
how they see out of them anyway.

18:19.208 --> 18:22.375
Tiny, beady, squinty
little things, aren't they?

18:22.458 --> 18:23.917
- Ambassador!
- 'No.'

18:24.000 --> 18:26.083
(Londo)
'The maker
has not been kind to you.'

18:26.167 --> 18:28.667
It must be terrible
trying to fly at night

18:28.750 --> 18:30.875
without running into
entire planets.

18:30.958 --> 18:33.500
Are you saying
the Centauri do not know

18:33.583 --> 18:35.333
what ships
are patrolling their borders?

18:35.417 --> 18:36.583
No, of course we know.

18:36.667 --> 18:39.750
The maker has gifted us
with great, big eyes

18:39.833 --> 18:43.375
and great, big scanners
and great big, uh..

18:44.750 --> 18:46.250
Well, that is
no concern of yours.

18:46.333 --> 18:50.042
Look, isn't there someone else
you can go and harass?

18:50.125 --> 18:53.000
My life is already
so full of joy as it is!

18:53.083 --> 18:55.875
Then you flatly deny
that you asked Sheridan

18:55.958 --> 18:58.333
to use the White Star fleet
to support your government

18:58.417 --> 19:00.375
and protect Centauri space?

19:00.458 --> 19:03.333
Absolutely. Anything else?

19:04.917 --> 19:06.500
No.

19:06.583 --> 19:08.875
Yeah, that will do.

19:08.958 --> 19:10.333
- Thank you.
- Open!

19:10.417 --> 19:11.708
[door whirring]

19:18.000 --> 19:19.083
[door whirring]

19:23.625 --> 19:24.708
[indistinct chattering]

19:24.792 --> 19:27.500
This may be more serious
than we thought.

19:27.583 --> 19:30.417
There's no question, they're
hiding something from us.

19:31.542 --> 19:33.500
Oh, there you are.

19:33.583 --> 19:34.833
I was gonna track you down

19:34.917 --> 19:36.792
one at a time, but since you're
all in one place--

19:36.875 --> 19:40.042
I'm sorry, doctor, we're in
the middle of something here.

19:40.125 --> 19:42.625
Yes, I can see that, but this
won't take but a moment.

19:42.708 --> 19:44.292
Uh, I was wondering
if your governments can send us

19:44.375 --> 19:48.208
some additional blood supplies
for each of your races.

19:48.292 --> 19:51.042
- Blood supplies?
- Yes.

19:51.125 --> 19:54.125
- How much?
- Oh, as much as you can spare.

19:54.208 --> 19:56.417
- Why?
- Oh, no particular reason.

19:56.500 --> 19:59.417
I just, uh, I just thought
it would be a good idea

19:59.500 --> 20:01.833
in case we needed it for..

20:01.917 --> 20:04.583
...well, in,
in the event of a crisis

20:04.667 --> 20:06.375
or an attack or..

20:06.458 --> 20:09.042
- What-what kind of attack?
- I'm in a hurry.

20:09.125 --> 20:12.083
I'm in the middle of something,
but I will send your governments

20:12.167 --> 20:13.583
a formal request later on today.

20:13.667 --> 20:16.458
I just wanted to let you know
that it was coming.

20:16.542 --> 20:18.958
I'll see you later, probably.

20:23.625 --> 20:25.000
This is very bad.

20:26.042 --> 20:27.083
Come!

20:35.458 --> 20:38.583
I cannot believe
that Delenn would allow this!

20:38.667 --> 20:41.542
It confirms everything
we have been hearing.

20:41.625 --> 20:43.333
Why else would Delenn
come this far

20:43.417 --> 20:45.458
and want Neroon to be here?

20:45.542 --> 20:47.375
Why else
would she return to Minbar

20:47.458 --> 20:49.833
with a Warrior at her side?

20:49.917 --> 20:52.083
You saw how she deferred to him

20:52.167 --> 20:54.833
spoke gently to him.

20:54.917 --> 20:57.708
So many of our caste
have suffered at the hands

20:57.792 --> 20:59.250
of the Warrior caste.

20:59.333 --> 21:01.333
Why else
would she behave this way

21:01.417 --> 21:03.875
unless she intended for us
to surrender?

21:03.958 --> 21:07.333
I saw Delenn
when Dukhat was alive.

21:07.417 --> 21:09.875
I know her heart!

21:09.958 --> 21:13.042
She would never do
what you describe.

21:13.125 --> 21:14.667
That was a long time ago.

21:14.750 --> 21:17.250
Many things
have changed since then.

21:17.333 --> 21:20.167
I heard her say it
as I passed by her quarters.

21:20.250 --> 21:24.292
"The Religious caste cannot
be allowed to win this war."

21:24.375 --> 21:26.958
We must do something.

21:27.042 --> 21:29.875
Ever since the war, the Warrior
caste have had nothing

21:29.958 --> 21:31.333
but disdain for us.

21:31.417 --> 21:33.083
"If you need
to surrender something

21:33.167 --> 21:35.875
"ask the Religious caste
to do it for you.

21:35.958 --> 21:39.750
That's their area of expertise."

21:39.833 --> 21:41.375
And now this.

21:41.458 --> 21:45.875
Only Delenn
can authorize a surrender.

21:45.958 --> 21:49.000
She's the only one
whom all the clans will honor.

21:50.083 --> 21:53.042
But we cannot move against her.

21:53.125 --> 21:55.292
To fight against the Warrior
caste, that is one thing

21:55.375 --> 21:58.708
but to strike down
one of our own..

21:58.792 --> 22:03.083
'...one who led the Grey
Council, the chosen of Dukhat..'

22:03.167 --> 22:04.500
'...it would tear
our caste apart'

22:04.583 --> 22:06.917
'and guarantee our loss
to the Warriors.'

22:07.000 --> 22:09.458
There is another way..

22:09.542 --> 22:12.542
...but it will mean
sacrificing all we have

22:12.625 --> 22:15.417
and all we will ever be.

22:15.500 --> 22:19.375
'We will lay down our lives
for our caste'

22:19.458 --> 22:21.000
or history
will not even remember us.

22:21.083 --> 22:22.917
They will only wonder
what happened to the ship

22:23.000 --> 22:25.750
and why it never reached home.

22:25.833 --> 22:27.667
But it must be done.

22:27.750 --> 22:29.000
For the good of everyone

22:29.083 --> 22:32.250
this ship cannot be allowed
to reach home.

22:32.333 --> 22:34.125
[dramatic music]

22:36.000 --> 22:37.875
[instrumental music]

22:47.708 --> 22:49.167
- Did you get it?
- Yes.

22:52.250 --> 22:53.667
Is this enough?

22:53.750 --> 22:56.833
(male #3)
'Enough for two ships
of this size.'

22:56.917 --> 22:59.417
I siphoned it directly
from the fuel system.

22:59.500 --> 23:01.833
Once released
into the air processing system

23:01.917 --> 23:04.625
it will poison the atmosphere
within minutes.

23:04.708 --> 23:07.292
After we are no more

23:07.375 --> 23:09.792
the ship will continue to drift
further into hyperspace

23:09.875 --> 23:11.167
'until we cannot be found.'

23:11.250 --> 23:13.708
The ship will become
a monument to our caste

23:13.792 --> 23:15.750
and to our willingness
to do all that we can

23:15.833 --> 23:17.458
to protect our people.

23:17.542 --> 23:20.292
I will put this into position
and await your signal.

23:20.375 --> 23:23.792
To think that one of our own
should turn against us

23:23.875 --> 23:25.375
I think I will welcome
the great sleep

23:25.458 --> 23:28.083
that I might never again
have such thoughts.

23:42.083 --> 23:45.125
[indistinct chattering]

23:52.167 --> 23:54.292
Oh, captain.

23:54.375 --> 23:55.667
I see you're just about
to go on.

23:55.750 --> 23:57.333
Yeah, I'm just checking over
some reports.

23:57.417 --> 24:00.333
- We go live in two minutes.
- Uh, what's that about?

24:00.417 --> 24:02.042
Well, ever since
we started broadcasting

24:02.125 --> 24:04.167
we've been getting reports back
from half of the outer colonies

24:04.250 --> 24:05.583
that are still aligned
with Earth.

24:05.667 --> 24:07.958
And we've got some great stuff
on President Clark.

24:08.042 --> 24:10.083
Did you know that three quarters
of his cabinet

24:10.167 --> 24:12.125
resigned in protest
over his martial law decree?

24:12.208 --> 24:14.000
- Hm?
- You don't hear that on ISN.

24:14.083 --> 24:15.625
Ah, that's great.

24:15.708 --> 24:18.125
(male #4)
'One minute thirty seconds,
commander.'

24:18.208 --> 24:21.417
Um, sir, are you going to, uh,
stay or..

24:21.500 --> 24:23.208
No, no, no. I, uh..

24:23.292 --> 24:27.875
I just stopped by to ask you
to, uh, plant a story for me.

24:27.958 --> 24:30.958
- Excuse me?
- Plant a story for me.

24:31.042 --> 24:34.208
'Uh, something I just want you
to drop into the broadcast.'

24:34.292 --> 24:35.583
Captain, with all due respect

24:35.667 --> 24:37.500
we can't just start
planting stories now.

24:37.583 --> 24:39.250
I mean, we've made a big deal
out of the fact

24:39.333 --> 24:41.625
that unlike ISN,
we're putting out the truth.

24:41.708 --> 24:43.208
If we become
a propaganda machine--

24:43.292 --> 24:45.042
That's the last thing I want.

24:45.125 --> 24:48.750
I just want you to mention
that nothing happened today

24:48.833 --> 24:52.333
in Sector 83 by 9 by 12.

24:52.417 --> 24:55.625
- 8-3-9-1-2?
- That's the one.

24:55.708 --> 24:57.375
(male #4)
'Thirty seconds.'

24:57.458 --> 25:00.208
But, sir, I just got
a status report from C &amp; C

25:00.292 --> 25:01.542
a little while ago

25:01.625 --> 25:03.750
and that sector's been
absolutely quiet.

25:03.833 --> 25:05.042
Exactly.

25:05.125 --> 25:08.125
So, uh, just relax
because what you're saying

25:08.208 --> 25:10.042
is absolutely true.

25:10.125 --> 25:11.917
That nothing
happened there today?

25:12.000 --> 25:13.208
(John)
'Yes.'

25:13.292 --> 25:16.667
Just casually mention
that nothing's going on.

25:16.750 --> 25:17.625
That's right.

25:17.708 --> 25:19.250
Yeah, make a big deal out of it

25:19.333 --> 25:22.708
uh, as much as you can,
given, nothing happened.

25:24.292 --> 25:26.792
- Sir, I..
- 'Ten seconds.'

25:26.875 --> 25:29.083
I better get out of the way.
You're just about to go on.

25:29.167 --> 25:31.708
- 'I'll talk to you later.'
- But I..

25:31.792 --> 25:33.000
(male #4)
'Go!'

25:36.167 --> 25:38.083
This is Commander Susan Ivanova
of Babylon 5

25:38.167 --> 25:40.083
bringing you
the "Voice Of The Resistance."

25:40.167 --> 25:42.292
In the next 20 minutes
we'll have updated information

25:42.375 --> 25:44.917
about President Clark's
continued illegal attacks

25:45.000 --> 25:46.583
against civilian targets on Mars

25:46.667 --> 25:49.625
and more information about
the struggle for Proxima III.

25:49.708 --> 25:51.958
Our best wishes go to our
brothers and sisters there

25:52.042 --> 25:53.458
who are fighting
for their freedom

25:53.542 --> 25:54.792
against overwhelming odds.

25:54.875 --> 25:56.375
We'll also have stunning news

25:56.458 --> 25:59.083
about the mass resignations
of cabinet-level advisers

25:59.167 --> 26:02.000
and the joint chiefs
over his campaign of terror.

26:02.083 --> 26:04.583
Our regards to those onboard
Earth Alliance Star ships

26:04.667 --> 26:06.792
who risk being arrested
and court-martialed

26:06.875 --> 26:08.458
for watching these telecasts.

26:08.542 --> 26:11.125
Your loyalty to Earth
and to freedom is appreciated.

26:11.208 --> 26:13.792
And we hope to have
some news for you soon.

26:13.875 --> 26:17.417
First, one brief announcement.

26:17.500 --> 26:19.625
I just wanted to mention
for those who have asked

26:19.708 --> 26:23.958
that absolutely nothing
whatsoever happened today

26:24.042 --> 26:27.083
in Sector 83 by 9 by 12.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.125
[indistinct chattering]

26:29.208 --> 26:31.333
I repeat, nothing happened.

26:31.417 --> 26:32.833
Please remain calm.

26:32.917 --> 26:35.000
[indistinct chattering]

26:35.917 --> 26:37.333
- Did you hear?
- Yes.

26:37.417 --> 26:40.917
And I just learned of an attack
by three White Star ships.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.042
- What did they attack?
- We do not know.

26:43.125 --> 26:45.500
Our scanners could not pick up
anything in the area

26:45.583 --> 26:48.125
only asteroids, debris.

26:48.208 --> 26:50.500
White Stars
do not attack asteroids.

26:50.583 --> 26:54.167
I know, but we saw nothing.

26:54.250 --> 26:56.792
Then the enemy..

26:56.875 --> 26:58.333
...must be invisible.

26:58.417 --> 27:00.833
- Some new cloaking system.
- Yes.

27:00.917 --> 27:03.167
No wonder the Centauri
asked for help.

27:03.250 --> 27:06.500
The White Star fleet is partly
based on Vorlon technology.

27:06.583 --> 27:08.042
Perhaps they are advanced enough

27:08.125 --> 27:11.125
to see this invisible enemy.

27:11.208 --> 27:13.292
They're keeping
this technology to themselves.

27:13.375 --> 27:15.542
With the Vorlon gone, they're
the only ones who have it.

27:15.625 --> 27:17.625
They want
to leave us unprotected

27:17.708 --> 27:19.417
left to fend for ourselves

27:19.500 --> 27:23.125
but we have a right to the same
protection as the Centauri.

27:23.208 --> 27:26.500
We cannot tolerate
this kind of discrimination

27:26.583 --> 27:29.083
in the face of grave danger!

27:30.625 --> 27:32.083
Invisible enemies..

27:32.167 --> 27:36.125
Strange things happening
in Sector 83.

27:36.208 --> 27:38.042
They could be anywhere.

27:38.125 --> 27:40.333
They could be all around us.

27:42.208 --> 27:44.250
[dramatic music]

27:54.667 --> 27:57.542
Ah, good, there you are.

27:57.625 --> 27:59.333
We're almost home.

27:59.417 --> 28:01.125
Just a little longer
and we will see

28:01.208 --> 28:04.333
if Delenn knows
what she is doing.

28:05.125 --> 28:06.417
End.

28:11.333 --> 28:12.625
Bring her to me.

28:13.958 --> 28:17.792
I have questions
which require answers.

28:22.833 --> 28:23.917
[groaning]

28:24.792 --> 28:27.833
[alarm ringing]

28:30.333 --> 28:31.750
The alarm.
Do you think they know?

28:31.833 --> 28:33.292
No, I don't think so.
Is everything in place?

28:33.375 --> 28:35.458
I set the timer
as soon as the alarm sounded.

28:35.542 --> 28:37.667
In a matter of moments
it will all be over.

28:37.750 --> 28:40.792
[alarm ringing]

28:44.875 --> 28:46.583
Neroon.

28:46.667 --> 28:49.750
- You sure you're alright?
- I'm fine, Delenn.

28:49.833 --> 28:52.250
It was a glancing blow.

28:52.333 --> 28:54.625
Take him below
and have his wounds treated.

28:54.708 --> 28:56.125
And he should rest.

28:56.208 --> 28:57.917
'If he doesn't choose to rest,
make him.'

28:58.000 --> 28:59.708
- Delenn.
- 'Go.'

29:04.708 --> 29:07.958
This one will go into the cells.

29:08.042 --> 29:11.042
Leave him a copy
of the sacred scrolls to read.

29:11.125 --> 29:12.792
Perhaps he will understand

29:12.875 --> 29:16.458
there are other ways to solve
disagreements than violence.

29:21.417 --> 29:22.958
'I'm glad you're here.'

29:23.042 --> 29:26.000
I need you to keep an eye on the
other Warriors that are aboard.

29:26.083 --> 29:28.042
Neroon was attacked
because some of them believe

29:28.125 --> 29:30.458
that the Warrior caste
is going to surrender to us.

29:30.542 --> 29:33.708
They would do anything necessary
to prevent that.

29:33.792 --> 29:38.667
Then we're..
They're not going to surrender?

29:38.750 --> 29:40.792
No, don't be foolish.

29:40.875 --> 29:43.500
If either side surrenders to
the other, there will be chaos

29:43.583 --> 29:45.833
our entire culture
would fall apart.

29:45.917 --> 29:48.292
There are other ways,
more reasonable ways

29:48.375 --> 29:51.208
but the extremists among us
never see that.

29:51.292 --> 29:52.833
'They would rather be martyrs'

29:52.917 --> 29:55.542
'to misinformation
and old ways.'

29:55.625 --> 29:58.083
- But we thought--
- Thought what?

29:59.458 --> 30:00.750
Nothing. Uh, nothing.

30:06.958 --> 30:09.375
Well, again..

30:09.458 --> 30:10.792
Keep an eye on them.

30:10.875 --> 30:13.375
If you suspect anything,
do not act directly.

30:13.458 --> 30:16.208
Tell me and I'll tell Neroon.

30:16.292 --> 30:19.000
[sighing]
Incredible.

30:19.083 --> 30:20.958
Only the Warrior caste
could actually

30:21.042 --> 30:23.833
turn on one of their own.

30:23.917 --> 30:25.292
'They have always been erratic.'

30:26.792 --> 30:28.250
And you..

30:28.333 --> 30:31.625
...you are the steady rock
beneath my feet.

30:34.583 --> 30:35.708
'Thank you.'

30:48.083 --> 30:51.542
- The poison.
- It's too late.

30:52.625 --> 30:55.542
(male #5)
It's starting right now.

30:55.625 --> 30:56.583
[coughing]

30:56.667 --> 30:59.667
[whooshing]

31:02.583 --> 31:05.542
[coughing]

31:13.333 --> 31:14.750
[coughing]

31:14.833 --> 31:17.917
[panting]

31:20.708 --> 31:23.458
[coughing]

31:25.125 --> 31:27.417
[groaning]

31:29.250 --> 31:31.750
Have we fallen so far

31:31.833 --> 31:36.167
that we cannot even
trust ourselves?

31:37.042 --> 31:39.083
[panting]

31:42.208 --> 31:43.333
[instrumental music]

31:58.792 --> 32:01.083
- How is he?
- Not well.

32:01.167 --> 32:03.958
I've asked my personal physician
to tend to Lennier.

32:04.042 --> 32:05.333
They are both in isolation

32:05.417 --> 32:06.958
to protect Lennier
from contamination

32:07.042 --> 32:08.333
until the doctor is finished.

32:08.417 --> 32:09.833
Do they know what happened?

32:09.917 --> 32:11.833
He appears to have been exposed

32:11.917 --> 32:14.375
to some residue
from the fuel system.

32:14.458 --> 32:16.708
How he came upon it,
I do not know.

32:16.792 --> 32:20.375
Only he can tell us
should he survive.

32:25.750 --> 32:29.000
'He means a great deal to you,
doesn't he?'

32:29.083 --> 32:31.250
I have been training him

32:31.333 --> 32:32.583
as Dukhat trained me.

32:34.750 --> 32:37.167
He has been..

32:37.250 --> 32:39.833
...a light for my footsteps

32:39.917 --> 32:41.750
never asking, only giving.

32:43.500 --> 32:45.292
Without him..

32:45.375 --> 32:48.375
...I would stumble and fall..

32:48.458 --> 32:49.792
...and never get up again.

32:53.500 --> 32:56.542
Thank you
for looking after him, Neroon.

32:56.625 --> 32:57.917
I fear we may be healing him

32:58.000 --> 33:00.042
only to see him
and the rest of us killed

33:00.125 --> 33:01.708
before we are finished.

33:01.792 --> 33:03.042
But it was the least I could do

33:03.125 --> 33:06.833
in return
for your gracious hospitality.

33:06.917 --> 33:11.042
I know the others are not happy
with my presence here.

33:11.125 --> 33:13.542
They will understand,
eventually.

33:13.625 --> 33:15.375
But only because
you will teach them.

33:17.167 --> 33:19.000
In the time that we have
known each other, Delenn

33:19.083 --> 33:22.500
I have not always
spoken well of you.

33:22.583 --> 33:25.042
I assumed
your behavior was prompted

33:25.125 --> 33:26.292
by a sense
of your own superiority

33:26.375 --> 33:29.250
your ego, the usual fanaticism

33:29.333 --> 33:32.833
we have come to expect
from the Religious caste.

33:32.917 --> 33:36.250
In the last year I've begun
to realize that I was wrong.

33:37.917 --> 33:40.167
Dukhat chose you above all

33:40.250 --> 33:42.083
to follow him.

33:42.167 --> 33:44.542
Slowly, dimly

33:44.625 --> 33:46.542
I begin to understand why.

33:48.583 --> 33:51.917
I do not know
what lies ahead of us, Delenn

33:52.000 --> 33:53.500
but I do know it is right

33:53.583 --> 33:56.167
that we are here together.

33:56.250 --> 33:57.833
Was that a compliment, Neroon?

33:58.958 --> 34:00.333
[chuckling softly]

34:00.417 --> 34:02.333
After a fashion.

34:02.417 --> 34:05.125
[indistinct chattering]

34:05.208 --> 34:08.333
Where is Sheridan? He's late!

34:08.417 --> 34:09.958
He will be here soon.

34:10.042 --> 34:12.875
Then we will confront him
with what we know!

34:12.958 --> 34:14.000
No.

34:15.292 --> 34:17.875
There is wisdom in silence

34:17.958 --> 34:21.667
wisdom in knowing more
than they believe we know.

34:21.750 --> 34:23.167
The Gaim is right!

34:23.250 --> 34:24.583
By showing them what we know

34:24.667 --> 34:27.125
we may put ourselves
at a disadvantage.

34:27.208 --> 34:29.000
'If we reveal
our sources of information'

34:29.083 --> 34:30.542
'he may shut them down'

34:30.625 --> 34:33.125
'prevent us from finding out
what is really going on!'

34:33.208 --> 34:36.958
Let Sheridan think we do not
know about this invisible enemy.

34:37.042 --> 34:38.958
Let him continue
to underestimate us

34:39.042 --> 34:41.625
as long as we get what we want.

34:41.708 --> 34:45.125
What pretext do we use
to get these ships? How--

34:45.208 --> 34:47.833
Sorry to be late, gentlemen.

34:47.917 --> 34:49.417
It's been a hectic day.

34:50.875 --> 34:52.333
Anything in particular, captain?

34:52.417 --> 34:55.250
- No, just the usual.
- Of course.

34:55.333 --> 34:57.958
Now, what is it
you wanted to see me about?

35:01.750 --> 35:04.750
Lately we've been hearing
about attacks by, uh..

35:04.833 --> 35:06.833
Raiding parties and Drakh.

35:06.917 --> 35:08.250
Yes, raiding parties against

35:08.333 --> 35:10.083
some of the smaller
League worlds.

35:10.167 --> 35:11.667
We feel
it is only a matter of time

35:11.750 --> 35:15.167
before they turn their attention
to our own civilizations.

35:15.250 --> 35:18.000
Well, I wouldn't put
too much stock in rumors.

35:18.083 --> 35:20.000
I'm sure you can handle
whatever comes your way.

35:20.083 --> 35:23.417
We lost many of our ships
fighting the Shadows.

35:23.500 --> 35:26.167
You have an obligation
to help us protect our borders

35:26.250 --> 35:28.083
until we can rebuild our fleets.

35:28.167 --> 35:29.875
You're talking about
the White Star fleet?

35:29.958 --> 35:31.000
We are.

35:32.042 --> 35:34.500
Well, there's nothing I can do.

35:34.583 --> 35:36.208
They're busy.

35:36.292 --> 35:37.792
Doing what?

35:39.958 --> 35:41.875
Uh..

35:41.958 --> 35:42.958
I-I can't tell you.

35:43.042 --> 35:44.667
[indistinct chattering]

35:44.750 --> 35:49.208
If you cannot tell us, then
it must not be very important.

35:49.292 --> 35:51.542
Captain, we insist!

35:51.625 --> 35:53.917
You must put
as many of the White Star fleet

35:54.000 --> 35:55.333
as you can around our borders.

35:55.417 --> 35:56.625
Now, just hold on a minute.

35:56.708 --> 35:59.375
We speak for the entire League!

35:59.458 --> 36:01.000
(Sheridan)
'Doesn't matter.'

36:01.083 --> 36:04.208
I can't put them on your borders
without the proper authorization

36:04.292 --> 36:06.750
to intercept raiders
and other ships

36:06.833 --> 36:08.875
entering or leaving the area.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.917
And since you're not likely
to give me the authorization

36:12.000 --> 36:16.125
that, as they say, gentlemen,
is that.

36:16.208 --> 36:17.750
Incorrect.

36:17.833 --> 36:20.500
We will provide them
with full authority.

36:20.583 --> 36:23.917
You cannot hide
behind that, captain.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.583
I see.

36:25.667 --> 36:29.542
Uh, but what if I need them
for a...larger mission?

36:31.833 --> 36:34.417
Then we will accompany them..

36:34.500 --> 36:36.042
...so that we may show
our own support

36:36.125 --> 36:38.958
for...whatever it is
you choose to do.

36:39.042 --> 36:41.417
You have no choice
in this, Sheridan.

36:41.500 --> 36:43.792
The League has spoken.

36:43.875 --> 36:45.375
You will bring
the White Star fleet

36:45.458 --> 36:47.792
into the League
of Non-Aligned Worlds.

36:47.875 --> 36:49.917
In return, the League
will support any action

36:50.000 --> 36:52.333
taken by the fleet.

36:52.417 --> 36:55.083
But I can't possibly
talk you out of this?

36:55.167 --> 36:56.375
We're afraid not.

36:58.583 --> 37:00.292
[sighing]

37:00.375 --> 37:02.583
Alright. I guess you're right.

37:02.667 --> 37:05.625
I don't have
a whole lot of choice in this.

37:05.708 --> 37:07.792
I'll have the diplomatic papers

37:07.875 --> 37:09.333
and treaties drawn up
this afternoon

37:09.417 --> 37:12.208
and delivered to each of you
by the end of the day.

37:12.292 --> 37:14.958
Good. Thank you, captain.

37:15.042 --> 37:16.333
You may go now.

37:19.208 --> 37:22.167
[indistinct chattering]

37:30.875 --> 37:31.917
[beeping]

37:36.958 --> 37:38.333
(Sheridan)
'Yes!'

37:52.208 --> 37:54.792
- Hm..
- Lennier.

37:57.542 --> 38:00.333
This is the second time
I have seen you near death.

38:00.417 --> 38:02.458
You are starting to acquire
bad habits.

38:04.083 --> 38:06.333
It was much safer in temple.

38:07.375 --> 38:09.458
Also far less interesting.

38:11.875 --> 38:13.667
The doctor tells me

38:13.750 --> 38:16.042
that they had to remove
part of your lung.

38:17.542 --> 38:19.333
- Hm.
- I'm sorry.

38:20.750 --> 38:22.833
(Delenn)
'Can you tell me
what happened?'

38:25.292 --> 38:26.417
[sighing]

38:26.500 --> 38:28.875
I was passing a maintenance tube

38:28.958 --> 38:30.958
on my way to see you

38:31.042 --> 38:35.542
when I, I smelled a discharge
from the fuel system.

38:35.625 --> 38:38.208
'There was no time
to call for help'

38:38.292 --> 38:40.208
'so I crawled into the tube'

38:40.292 --> 38:44.208
and I shut the valve.
There was no other choice.

38:44.292 --> 38:45.875
If I had waited,
it would have been drawn

38:45.958 --> 38:48.708
into the air recycling system.

38:48.792 --> 38:51.375
You're sure it wasn't sabotage?

38:51.458 --> 38:53.375
'I have been wondering
if some of the Warrior caste'

38:53.458 --> 38:55.417
'might have been involved.'

38:57.000 --> 38:59.250
No, I think
we can be fairly certain

38:59.333 --> 39:02.417
the Warrior caste
was not involved.

39:02.500 --> 39:04.250
Well..

39:04.333 --> 39:07.500
...there's at least
that much good news.

39:07.583 --> 39:09.792
You did
a very brave thing, Lennier.

39:09.875 --> 39:12.417
Everyone here is in your debt.

39:12.500 --> 39:14.167
Now rest.

39:14.250 --> 39:16.458
'We'll be at Minbar
by this time tomorrow.'

39:20.000 --> 39:22.458
See to it that
he's made comfortable.

39:22.542 --> 39:24.583
His actions have
honored all of us.

39:33.958 --> 39:35.000
Why?

39:38.375 --> 39:40.750
I should sleep now.

39:40.833 --> 39:42.125
I'm very tired.

39:42.208 --> 39:45.292
Please, we need to know.

39:45.375 --> 39:46.833
You could have told her
the whole truth

39:46.917 --> 39:48.750
no one here
would have blamed you

39:48.833 --> 39:50.167
but you didn't.

39:51.083 --> 39:52.875
Why?

39:52.958 --> 39:55.500
If I had told her
the whole truth

39:55.583 --> 39:57.625
it would have
destroyed her belief

39:57.708 --> 40:01.333
in the strength
and the wisdom of our caste.

40:01.417 --> 40:05.083
Delenn does not walk in the same
world that you and I walk in.

40:05.167 --> 40:08.292
'She does not see the same world
that you and I see.'

40:08.375 --> 40:11.792
In her world,
we are better than we are.

40:11.875 --> 40:14.292
'We care more than we care.'

40:14.375 --> 40:17.292
'We act towards each other
with compassion.'

40:17.375 --> 40:19.417
I much prefer her world
to that of my own

40:19.500 --> 40:22.667
and I will not allow anything
to threaten that.

40:22.750 --> 40:24.083
I understand.

40:24.917 --> 40:27.417
Thank you, Lennier.

40:27.500 --> 40:30.167
Do not thank me.
I did it for her.

40:30.250 --> 40:32.542
I did not do it for you.

40:32.625 --> 40:35.292
In future, I would suggest
you try to see the world

40:35.375 --> 40:37.750
through her eyes sometime.

40:37.833 --> 40:40.625
'It might lead you to make
fewer fatal mistakes.'

40:43.833 --> 40:45.500
Now go away.

40:45.583 --> 40:47.667
We'll be home soon
and I'll need all my strength

40:47.750 --> 40:49.375
to deal with the new problems

40:49.458 --> 40:51.750
without dwelling
on the old ones.

41:05.292 --> 41:06.792
[beeping]

41:08.167 --> 41:10.542
This is Commander Susan Ivanova
of Babylon 5

41:10.625 --> 41:12.542
bringing you
the "Voice Of The Resistance."

41:12.625 --> 41:13.875
In a show of solidarity

41:13.958 --> 41:15.667
the League of Non-Aligned Worlds
announced today

41:15.750 --> 41:18.042
the formation
of an authorized patrol force

41:18.125 --> 41:19.792
to curb the activities
of raiders and others

41:19.875 --> 41:22.375
who have been preying upon
civilian transports.

41:22.458 --> 41:24.000
Later in this stellarcast,
we'll have news

41:24.083 --> 41:25.542
from the resistance
at Proxima III

41:25.625 --> 41:28.417
and other safe havens.

41:28.500 --> 41:30.458
Rumors have reached us
concerning fighting going on

41:30.542 --> 41:32.167
in the capital city of Minbar.

41:32.250 --> 41:35.042
'We ask that anyone with solid
news of events going on there'

41:35.125 --> 41:37.417
'please contact us
with that information.'

41:37.500 --> 41:38.958
On the chance
that anyone on Minbar

41:39.042 --> 41:41.000
might be monitoring
this stellarcast

41:41.083 --> 41:42.750
we send them our best wishes

41:42.833 --> 41:45.000
and hope
they come through this safely.

41:54.000 --> 41:55.042
Oh.

41:56.000 --> 41:57.292
[groaning]

42:03.042 --> 42:05.375
[groaning]

42:33.000 --> 42:34.542
Delenn?

42:36.542 --> 42:39.042
Lennier? What is it?

42:39.125 --> 42:42.000
Neroon...he's gone.

42:45.083 --> 42:47.333
[droning]

42:49.708 --> 42:51.917
Message from Alit Neroon
to Shakiri

42:52.000 --> 42:54.417
Shai Alit of the Warrior caste.

42:54.500 --> 42:56.125
The mission has been successful.

42:56.208 --> 42:57.583
I have access to their plans

42:57.667 --> 43:00.583
to counterattack our forces
in the capital city.

43:00.667 --> 43:03.375
They can be stopped
and stopped easily.

43:03.458 --> 43:05.292
[device beeping]

43:05.375 --> 43:07.833
The Religious caste is divided

43:07.917 --> 43:10.000
and their support is weak.

43:10.083 --> 43:11.542
It is as you said, Shakiri

43:11.625 --> 43:15.167
they do not have the stomach
for a prolonged conflict.

43:15.250 --> 43:17.375
Tell our ships to stand by.

43:17.458 --> 43:19.833
Victory will be ours
within the week.

43:22.500 --> 43:24.542
[crackling]

43:30.750 --> 43:33.542
[instrumental music]

43:36.250 --> 43:38.708
[theme music]

44:05.792 --> 44:08.833
[music continues]
