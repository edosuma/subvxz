"Put on the full armor of God, to be able to stand

00:08.477 --> 00:10.546
Against the wiles of the Devil,

00:10.546 --> 00:13.949
For our struggle is not against flesh and blood,

00:13.949 --> 00:17.153
BUT AGAINST ... SPIRITUAL FORCES OF EVIL

00:40.042 --> 00:42.278
My name is Luke O'Brian.

00:42.278 --> 00:44.914
Working as a salesman during the day.

00:44.914 --> 00:48.884
At night, I attended the faculty of law Billy Simon,

00:48.884 --> 00:50.613
in Sydney, Australia.

00:51.754 --> 00:55.087
My goal in life has always been to become a lawyer,

00:55.558 --> 00:56.926
until ...

00:56.926 --> 00:57.393
The Devil in the dock santacruz [A More Passionate Fans of Brazil]: P

00:57.393 --> 01:00.863
The Devil in the dock some tragedies have made me question my own existence.

01:00.863 --> 01:01.887
Some tragedies have made me question my own existence.

01:03.098 --> 01:08.764
I wonder why the Lord allows Satan to do so much.

01:09.405 --> 01:13.432
This was the worst year of my life.

01:29.091 --> 01:32.891
Today, the country was struck by another mass murder.

01:33.562 --> 01:37.521
This time a gunman killed 15 people in a hospital and then killed himself.

01:40.402 --> 01:41.892
This is unacceptable.

01:43.038 --> 01:44.874
No, it's ridiculous.

01:44.874 --> 01:47.035
As an account can disappear?

01:48.844 --> 01:52.147
Some human garbage and you stole my money ...

01:52.147 --> 01:54.672
What kind of idiots working there?

01:55.050 --> 01:57.314
Luke, stop it!

02:02.191 --> 02:03.283
Honey.

02:03.592 --> 02:05.861
Honey, are you okay? Sorry.

02:05.861 --> 02:07.930
I was brought back to reality.

02:07.930 --> 02:09.865
The world is lost.

02:09.865 --> 02:12.368
Another news says that the price of gasoline continues to rise

02:12.368 --> 02:15.360
and the oil companies do not give explanations.

02:16.305 --> 02:17.506
"My God!" Sean, who hadn't seen the phenomenon earlier, cried out.

02:17.506 --> 02:19.441
you see how things are?

02:19.441 --> 02:22.044
My mother was killed by a drunk driver, Gwen,

02:22.044 --> 02:24.813
and that same driver is loose in the streets,

02:24.813 --> 02:28.017
together with other outcasts, including those who stole our money.

02:28.017 --> 02:31.086
If I had Satan in my hands right now,

02:31.086 --> 02:33.255
I cut into small pieces.

02:33.255 --> 02:36.383
And do the same with the damn that killed my mother!

02:40.863 --> 02:42.524
I go to the college library.

02:45.301 --> 02:48.370
Everyone needs compassion,

02:48.370 --> 02:51.396
a love that never fails.

02:53.108 --> 02:58.171
What mercy upon me.

02:59.081 --> 03:01.948
Do not tell me that I left the bullets in the house!

03:04.153 --> 03:06.587
Then something happened.

03:11.760 --> 03:16.891
Suddenly, a Bible came in the glove compartment.

03:19.068 --> 03:25.337
I would have so departed from God what he thought about killing a man?

03:26.742 --> 03:28.676
Why could not forgive him?

03:29.578 --> 03:30.909
Why?

03:33.015 --> 03:36.352
How I became what I am now?

03:36.352 --> 03:39.388
A man who hated people ...

03:39.388 --> 03:41.879
instead of loving my neighbor.

03:44.093 --> 03:45.617
Who am I?

03:55.204 --> 03:58.774
Take me as I am,

03:58.774 --> 04:01.675
all my fears and failures.

04:03.746 --> 04:08.149
Complete my life again.

04:08.617 --> 04:13.953
Upon returning home, I realized that the spiritual battle we all face.

04:16.325 --> 04:19.394
Satan approaches you as a lion, brothers and sisters,

04:19.394 --> 04:21.262
do not forget it.

04:21.262 --> 04:26.530
The biggest lie is to convince you that it does not exist.

04:29.838 --> 04:33.399
And I believe in the devil.

04:33.809 --> 04:35.743
Suddenly I realized that.

04:36.345 --> 04:38.514
All the world's problems

04:38.514 --> 04:41.677
somehow relate to this evil being.

04:43.719 --> 04:45.587
So many lies and deception.

04:45.587 --> 04:47.923
And because of this serpent,

04:47.923 --> 04:51.260
the world becomes increasingly worse.

04:51.260 --> 04:55.128
Then I thought about making a daring thing.

04:55.798 --> 05:00.536
If the world is turning into a hell, I can try to kill some demons.

05:00.536 --> 05:04.472
That was the day I decided to expose him.

05:04.807 --> 05:09.111
Yes, you heard me right. Exposing Satan.

05:09.111 --> 05:12.740
And I can show the wiles of the devil better than anyone.

05:13.982 --> 05:18.120
If all we do, I can process only one

05:18.120 --> 05:20.611
who brought the world their worst pain.

05:23.592 --> 05:26.795
Luke O'Brian against Satan?

05:26.795 --> 05:28.530
- That's right.

05:28.530 --> 05:29.932
Satan?

05:29.932 --> 05:31.365
Yes, exactly.

05:32.067 --> 05:33.728
He's last name?

05:34.369 --> 05:35.028
PROCESSED

05:37.239 --> 05:41.610
I had the address of Satan to send a copy of the process,

05:41.610 --> 05:45.376
but I have walked the path to a hearing before a judge.

05:48.450 --> 05:51.078
Luke O'Brian against Satan?

05:51.620 --> 05:52.780
Yes, Your Honor.

05:52.780 --> 05:54.684
Satan is processing?

05:58.393 --> 05:59.325
"Crazy?

05:59.661 --> 06:01.029
Order!

06:01.029 --> 06:02.131
Yes, Your Honor.

06:02.131 --> 06:05.167
Are you aware that is the international court of human rights?

06:05.167 --> 06:09.831
Your Honor, Satan has violated all human rights know that!

06:09.831 --> 06:12.641
- It is with a psychiatrist?
- No.

06:12.641 --> 06:15.110
- Do you take any medicine?
-Yes.

06:15.110 --> 06:16.873
No, I was taking.

06:17.646 --> 06:21.250
Mr. O'Brian is wasting the court with this ridiculous process.

06:21.250 --> 06:24.987
Your Honor, I can prove that Satan is a viable defendant.

06:24.987 --> 06:26.755
Through the process "Dogar versus Marlboro"

06:26.755 --> 06:29.525
and Section 10-3 of the processes of international civil liberties ...

06:29.525 --> 06:32.461
Very well. I understand.

06:32.461 --> 06:36.329
And of course, Satan did not respond to this quote.

06:36.598 --> 06:38.828
I would like to bring a prosecution in absentia.

06:39.701 --> 06:42.905
And how do you expect to make that statement?

06:42.905 --> 06:45.440
I've had to put in the newspaper.

06:45.440 --> 06:47.276
Do you still read these things?

06:47.276 --> 06:49.745
Yes, and I think that may be accepted if necessary.

06:49.745 --> 06:52.548
Try to meet him in hell next time. Just a hint.

06:52.548 --> 06:55.284
I knew she would nullify the cause.

06:55.284 --> 06:58.320
I just wanted to vent my frustration against Satan.

06:58.320 --> 07:02.891
But what she said next took me by surprise.

07:02.891 --> 07:07.529
You'll have to send a notification to the defendant in this case, Satan.

07:07.529 --> 07:10.327
Through a bailiff. I give you another 30 days.

07:11.266 --> 07:13.200
But I can not do that, Your Honor.

07:13.902 --> 07:17.506
I can not allow trials in absentia unless the defendant is cited.

07:17.506 --> 07:18.530
Next case!

07:26.548 --> 07:29.711
"What's this?
- It is a case against Satan.

07:31.486 --> 07:34.022
- Is this a joke?
- No, it is not.

07:34.022 --> 07:36.616
If it works here, I want to hand it to him.

07:37.960 --> 07:41.697
70 lawyers work here. Choose who you want.

07:41.697 --> 07:42.857
I see.

07:45.901 --> 07:47.266
Hey, man,

07:47.769 --> 07:50.439
why do you think Satan works here?

07:50.439 --> 07:53.008
Give it to him to find it, okay?

07:53.008 --> 07:56.645
Hey, this is a serious company, okay?

07:56.645 --> 08:00.182
Yes, we have strippers, drunks and gamblers, but you know what?

08:00.182 --> 08:02.884
Do not allow smoking inside, you know?

08:02.884 --> 08:05.284
You are Satan worshipers?

08:07.122 --> 08:11.491
Could they deliver it to him if they find him?

08:12.127 --> 08:13.560
Thank you."

08:19.735 --> 08:22.602
I see that the process gave a law firm,

08:23.305 --> 08:27.799
a strip club, an investment agency and an oil company.

08:28.210 --> 08:29.700
Why stop there?

08:30.078 --> 08:32.381
Tried to deliver a shopping used car?

08:32.381 --> 08:34.280
If Satan is somewhere you can be there.

08:36.451 --> 08:37.712
Yeah, I did not think about it, Your Honor.

08:52.934 --> 08:56.392
Would you like a trial in absentia against Satan.

08:56.705 --> 08:58.273
Trial in absentia?

08:58.273 --> 09:00.642
Yes, Your Honor. I want it plowed ...

09:00.642 --> 09:05.011
that the case against him is 8 trillion dollars.

09:07.382 --> 09:10.977
I will undo this process for technical details,

09:11.253 --> 09:13.789
and because you are crazy.

09:13.789 --> 09:16.291
Then the most amazing thing happened.

09:16.291 --> 09:19.294
I will also penalize Io, because ...

09:19.294 --> 09:20.886
Why?

09:21.763 --> 09:23.628
I am here, Your Honor.

09:29.905 --> 09:34.774
Have you had this strange feeling that a fake can be real, anyway?

09:37.579 --> 09:39.274
And who are you?

09:43.485 --> 09:46.420
- Satan, Your Honor.
- Oh, Your Honor.

09:47.789 --> 09:49.780
Very beautiful.

09:50.625 --> 09:53.328
So you two are in this together?

09:53.328 --> 09:56.231
I am here to respond to the citation, Your Honor.

09:56.231 --> 10:01.498
And I will address the process of Mr. Luke O'Brien.

10:02.304 --> 10:03.862
"What's this?

10:07.743 --> 10:09.540
Very good.

10:11.113 --> 10:13.843
you almost got me.

10:14.616 --> 10:16.516
Made my day.

10:17.786 --> 10:20.311
It's a trick question? Where are the cameras?

10:21.323 --> 10:24.656
Sorry, but it is very serious, Your Honor.

10:27.295 --> 10:29.598
For I am not amused at all.

10:29.598 --> 10:30.963
Neither did I.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.025
Can prove that it is Satan?

10:39.841 --> 10:42.139
Can you prove that I am?

10:47.015 --> 10:49.176
____What is happening here?

10:51.219 --> 10:54.211
Oh, my God! It's so hot here! Bailiff?

10:54.790 --> 10:57.918
Bailiff? Why does the heater is on?

10:58.326 --> 10:59.850
What do you think?

11:00.762 --> 11:02.992
Oh, my God! Bailiff!

11:03.398 --> 11:05.889
What happened to the heater? Check it out.

11:07.369 --> 11:10.872
Assuming that whoever says it is,

11:10.872 --> 11:13.670
realize the extent of what you're saying?

11:13.875 --> 11:17.813
The land is mine. And I'll defend myself.

11:17.813 --> 11:19.872
You have legal representation?

11:24.553 --> 11:28.751
If I have legal representation?

11:47.108 --> 11:50.879
I know what they are thinking. No need to say.

11:50.879 --> 11:53.643
That man would be even the devil?

11:56.585 --> 12:01.189
I must say you have a lot of courage, boy. Sue me!

12:01.189 --> 12:04.647
Do you really know what you're getting into?

12:05.694 --> 12:07.629
You are not Satan himself, is it?

12:07.629 --> 12:11.622
And you're not Luke's silly, is not stupid?

12:14.035 --> 12:18.062
For it is good to get good lawyers, because I'll beat you.

12:18.673 --> 12:21.810
You're just a moron. Do you know how insignificant?

12:21.810 --> 12:23.445
After all, in an instant ...

12:23.445 --> 12:27.649
I can send you a small boat into the deep red.

12:27.649 --> 12:32.254
Hey, I have God on my side, okay? And He created you.

12:32.254 --> 12:33.955
Have a card there?

12:33.955 --> 12:36.758
- I have no card.
"No?"

12:36.758 --> 12:38.453
Well, here's mine.

12:39.528 --> 12:42.190
Call whenever you want.

12:44.099 --> 12:45.999
Hey, do not aspire to smoke.

12:49.638 --> 12:51.572
See you in court, kid.

13:02.350 --> 13:06.286
Oh, I know. Nice sleight of hand.

13:09.591 --> 13:13.762
I needed someone to help me. Someone you trust.

13:13.762 --> 13:16.424
There was only one person I knew.

13:16.831 --> 13:18.196
Disappear.

13:19.267 --> 13:21.870
Please, Mel. Do not talk like that to a friend.

13:21.870 --> 13:24.532
Friends do not invite friends to render Satan.

13:26.775 --> 13:29.608
I really need your help on this, please.

13:30.312 --> 13:32.847
Luke, I just graduated.

13:32.847 --> 13:35.917
My first case is not a suit against Satan.

13:35.917 --> 13:37.407
Find another sucker.

13:40.021 --> 13:41.318
Mel!

13:49.130 --> 13:52.167
Do you judge set the date for the trial next week

13:52.167 --> 13:55.830
What surprised everyone in the courtroom, including me.

13:57.072 --> 13:59.975
After that, I was called to give a million interviews,

13:59.975 --> 14:03.001
which, of course, refused.

14:03.645 --> 14:05.340
Honey, I.

14:07.882 --> 14:10.852
They may call it crazy, but Luke O'Brien is suing the devil.

14:10.852 --> 14:12.454
Do you judge was about to dismiss the case

14:12.454 --> 14:16.358
until a man appeared claiming to be the devil.

14:16.358 --> 14:19.555
It was another day in court in Sydney weird.

14:20.562 --> 14:23.298
Are you sure you want to continue with this?

14:23.298 --> 14:25.289
Yes, of course.

14:27.268 --> 14:31.967
The devil is responsible for what the world is going.

14:32.807 --> 14:34.502
You said it yourself.

14:34.876 --> 14:37.970
Yes, but I told you to go to court to sue Io.

14:47.956 --> 14:50.254
Why are you doing this, Luke?

14:53.361 --> 14:57.422
Because the devil is real and I have to expose Io.

14:58.600 --> 15:00.659
I have to expose Io.

15:05.340 --> 15:08.276
Ladies and gentlemen, please.

15:08.276 --> 15:13.548
Thank you for coming so quickly to an important event.

15:13.548 --> 15:17.452
Now, without further ado, I present my client,

15:17.452 --> 15:20.717
who prefers to be called "Prince."

15:22.190 --> 15:24.793
Here it is, your dream team.

15:24.793 --> 15:27.128
The best lawyers around the world ...

15:27.128 --> 15:29.531
are in Sydney for this trial.

15:29.531 --> 15:30.589
"Great!

15:36.004 --> 15:40.108
Here, you, your dream team.

15:40.108 --> 15:43.978
The best, the brightest, the smartest lawyers in the world.

15:43.978 --> 15:45.741
And also the most expensive.

15:48.883 --> 15:53.121
Mr. Ice, Oxford, his IQ is 214.

15:53.121 --> 15:56.324
He helped bring down a law that tried to find a cure for cancer.

15:56.324 --> 16:00.028
I'm not sure about cancer, after all ...

16:00.028 --> 16:04.899
when people are dying of cancer, they think more of God, is not it?

16:04.899 --> 16:08.236
Now, do not be so paranoid, Prince, because ...

16:08.236 --> 16:10.839
God is also cursed, right?

16:10.839 --> 16:13.408
Curse God. This is an intelligent response.

16:13.408 --> 16:15.239
Well, I liked you.

16:17.011 --> 16:20.014
Miss. Black, graduated from Yale.

16:20.014 --> 16:22.550
The youngest and best lawyer in New York.

16:22.550 --> 16:25.587
67 wins and no losses.

16:25.587 --> 16:28.656
Helped defeat an electric car in court.

16:28.656 --> 16:30.892
Your customers, oil.

16:30.892 --> 16:35.363
What would you say if I offered you $ 100 million

16:35.363 --> 16:39.493
and asked in exchange for his soul?

16:40.101 --> 16:42.160
100 million for my soul?

16:42.670 --> 16:44.137
Why pay?

16:45.373 --> 16:47.976
Thank you. Good answer.

16:47.976 --> 16:50.645
- I like this team.
- Nice to meet you, Prince.

16:50.645 --> 16:53.248
Mr. Thinktank, Harvard-educated lawyer.

16:53.248 --> 16:54.516
- Thinktank.
____How are you lady?

16:54.516 --> 16:57.719
Helped defeat the rights of passengers.

16:57.719 --> 17:00.922
Your customers are the airlines.

17:00.922 --> 17:03.591
Aviation? I hate aviation.

17:03.591 --> 17:04.925
But I love, however,

17:04.925 --> 17:09.196
see people in those long lines, is not it?

17:09.196 --> 17:13.835
Waiting for security, removing his shoes.

17:13.835 --> 17:15.670
I love to watch it!

17:15.670 --> 17:19.406
And charge for excess baggage. It was my initiative.

17:19.406 --> 17:22.076
Did you? I love greed.

17:22.076 --> 17:24.679
- Welcome to the team.
- Thank you, sir.

17:24.679 --> 17:27.113
Very well. Ms. Shy.

17:27.682 --> 17:30.151
University of Sydney. His name is famous.

17:30.151 --> 17:32.654
She is a shark in the courtroom.

17:32.654 --> 17:36.991
I knew that was not satisfied with their pay.

17:36.991 --> 17:39.016
All work by many dollars.

17:39.260 --> 17:44.332
And it very well. And there are many dollars to you?

17:44.332 --> 17:46.323
Ten million in cash.

17:47.168 --> 17:49.534
See how she is bold?

17:50.138 --> 17:52.340
Sith, please.

17:52.340 --> 17:55.434
Not interested in defeating Satan?

17:55.844 --> 17:58.312
That way, no, I'm not.

17:58.646 --> 18:01.716
Nobody is helping me in this case.

18:01.716 --> 18:04.241
Also, think of all the publicity.

18:04.619 --> 18:07.088
Will be in every newspaper.

18:07.088 --> 18:09.257
You will have many customers then

18:09.257 --> 18:11.350
he will not even know where to start.

18:12.594 --> 18:16.928
Seriously, I need your help. Please.

18:17.732 --> 18:22.066
Luke, and even if the man is Satan? Have you thought about it?

18:22.604 --> 18:24.072
"Yeah...and so what?"

18:24.072 --> 18:27.075
You know that God is on my side. On our side.

18:27.075 --> 18:29.444
God is on our side.

18:29.444 --> 18:31.079
God....

18:31.079 --> 18:33.741
You know that God does not like for breakfast?

18:35.049 --> 18:38.041
Of cereals and nuts. And you're crazy.

18:39.287 --> 18:43.491
Mr. Innocent. Io will adore. She graduated from Columbia.

18:43.491 --> 18:46.361
Represents all the casinos in Las Vegas.

18:46.361 --> 18:49.030
Las Vegas? He plays here, my friend.

18:49.030 --> 18:51.866
It's my town. I love Las Vegas.

18:51.866 --> 18:56.137
All those players, those idiots who lose everything.

18:56.137 --> 18:59.908
I love when they play in 16 and gives 5.

18:59.908 --> 19:02.810
All those guys idiots. I love it!

19:02.810 --> 19:04.979
They are so disappointed!

19:04.979 --> 19:09.117
I helped defeat a ridiculous case against passive smoking in casinos.

19:09.117 --> 19:13.521
They said that a casino one hour equals three months of secondhand smoke.

19:13.521 --> 19:16.090
Oh, I know. And what happened?

19:16.090 --> 19:19.027
As in my ÃºItima poker game, I won, of course.

19:19.027 --> 19:23.123
I will defeat Luke O'Brian, he will give me great joy.

19:23.398 --> 19:26.167
The Lord will do this.

19:26.167 --> 19:29.500
Seriously. And you will take action and do so.

19:31.806 --> 19:33.641
Okay, Luke. If I agree to help you,

19:33.641 --> 19:37.879
will you promise to the end, no matter what happens?

19:37.879 --> 19:40.541
- Why not?
- Then promise.

19:41.249 --> 19:42.614
I promise.

19:44.519 --> 19:47.352
Okay. I agree. Let's move on.

19:48.256 --> 19:50.491
Thank you very much.

19:50.491 --> 19:53.594
Mr. Inyourface, the faculty of Stanford.

19:53.594 --> 19:56.197
Oh, Stanford, very good.

19:56.197 --> 19:58.800
I know it sounds very selfish, sir, but ...

19:58.800 --> 20:01.569
I am the greatest, so do not worry about anything.

20:01.569 --> 20:04.595
Great. That's not what Muhammad Ali said?

20:05.673 --> 20:08.776
- Prof. Fields, University of New York.
- Hi, teacher!

20:08.776 --> 20:11.746
It's a ridiculous process and we will win.

20:11.746 --> 20:16.351
Very well. Ridiculous. Winning. That sounds good. Thank you.

20:16.351 --> 20:21.220
And finally, Miss. Scarlett.

20:21.823 --> 20:24.621
It represents the tobacco industry.

20:26.661 --> 20:29.530
No need to say more.

20:29.530 --> 20:31.566
It is an honor to represent Io, sir.

20:31.566 --> 20:34.194
Most of what they say about you is not true.

20:35.470 --> 20:38.706
What do you mean? What they say about me?

20:38.706 --> 20:41.909
I'm always slandered by these believers idiots.

20:41.909 --> 20:45.504
About how much you are bad. It is not true.

20:45.980 --> 20:48.778
Not at all! I am much worse.

20:51.185 --> 20:55.554
A quick question. Raise your hands those who believe in God.

20:57.058 --> 21:01.586
Very well. Raise your hands those who love God.

21:01.829 --> 21:05.060
Like it? Like it? Like it? No one.

21:05.666 --> 21:10.371
I think Luke O'Brien is our enemy as you.

21:10.371 --> 21:15.035
He does not like God. But that still does not know that.

21:15.476 --> 21:19.847
Very well. As everyone knows, this trial will be seen around the world.

21:19.847 --> 21:23.977
Needless to say, my client never loses.

21:24.819 --> 21:26.184
Never.

21:26.554 --> 21:30.046
And what we know about this Luke O'Brian?

21:30.046 --> 21:33.961
No need to worry about Luke O'Brian. He is finished.

21:33.961 --> 21:37.198
Well, we should not underestimate Io.

21:37.198 --> 21:40.690
We will not. That's why you'll end up with him.

21:43.704 --> 21:47.105
And then came the first day of trial.

21:48.943 --> 21:54.210
The jury was selected in a random electronic process following a new law.

21:54.515 --> 21:57.609
That was crazy.

21:59.987 --> 22:06.260
We are in front of the International Court of Human Rights,

22:06.260 --> 22:09.864
where Luke O'Brian should arrive.

22:09.864 --> 22:12.133
Look. He is there!

22:12.133 --> 22:14.502
Luke! Luke! Luke!

22:14.502 --> 22:18.199
I have a serious question for you. You're an idiot?

22:19.006 --> 22:20.200
No.

22:21.576 --> 22:24.812
- Luke, can not be taking this case seriously.
- Of course I'm serious.

22:24.812 --> 22:26.814
Do you really believe he is the devil?

22:26.814 --> 22:29.078
The devil is alive and well.

22:29.350 --> 22:32.153
Luke, Luke, why are you suing the devil?

22:32.153 --> 22:35.156
He ruined my life, ruined the world.

22:35.156 --> 22:36.987
He has to pay for it.

22:37.258 --> 22:39.627
- And do you really think have a chance?
-Yes.

22:39.627 --> 22:41.788
I really believe, at heart.

22:49.904 --> 22:52.540
Satan! Satan! It has something to say?

22:52.540 --> 22:54.208
I always have something to say.

22:54.208 --> 22:58.907
- Are you really Satan?
- Of course. Want to dance with Satan?

23:01.048 --> 23:03.918
Hopes that the public believes is Satan?

23:03.918 --> 23:06.654
Expects the public to believe that you should ...

23:06.654 --> 23:10.420
$ 12,000 on credit cards?

23:11.225 --> 23:14.061
____How do you know?
- You can start paying.

23:14.061 --> 23:16.689
If it is Satan, then prove it.

23:16.898 --> 23:19.162
Well, check this out.

23:24.071 --> 23:26.039
I think he was surprised.

23:27.008 --> 23:29.744
I can only say that ...

23:29.744 --> 23:32.780
the world is full of losers.

23:32.780 --> 23:36.384
How many people will sue me and blame me

23:36.384 --> 23:39.587
because they could not do what is right?

23:39.587 --> 23:42.456
Got it? They are losers.

23:42.456 --> 23:45.660
Mr. Luke O'Brien, are you listening?

23:45.660 --> 23:47.662
Satan, just want to say that I'm your fan

23:47.662 --> 23:49.497
I love you, I'm crazy about you.

23:49.497 --> 23:51.399
- I love the group Kiss.
What?"

23:51.399 --> 23:52.923
Kiss! Kiss!

23:56.804 --> 24:00.171
I hate Kiss. I prefer Tom Jones.

24:04.679 --> 24:07.381
YOU DECIDE THE VERDICT WITH BARRY POLK

24:07.381 --> 24:12.053
It will be the trial of the century, will be seen by audiences around the world.

24:12.053 --> 24:15.356
Welcome to the "You Decide the Verdict."

24:15.356 --> 24:17.758
I'm Barry Polk, and are now with me ...

24:17.758 --> 24:19.594
Tony "Light" Anzaldo,

24:19.594 --> 24:22.496
and Jasmine Williams. Welcome.

24:22.496 --> 24:23.564
Tony, let's start with you.

24:23.564 --> 24:27.432
Do you think that Luke O'Brian has a chance against Satan?

24:30.838 --> 24:31.770
No.

24:32.573 --> 24:34.564
Very well. Jasmine?

24:34.909 --> 24:37.645
I think the world is rooting for Luke O'Brian,

24:37.645 --> 24:40.381
and we all hope he wins.

24:40.381 --> 24:41.609
"I don't...

24:43.251 --> 24:46.721
We talk to Mark Engstrom, who is on the subject there ...

24:46.721 --> 24:49.757
Tony, you'll love this. London, England.

24:49.757 --> 24:50.746
Mark?

24:51.759 --> 24:56.364
Barry, all in England are fascinated with this case.

24:56.364 --> 25:01.636
And the question we all ask is: Is it really Satan?

25:01.636 --> 25:04.205
Mark, excuse me a moment. We go back now

25:04.205 --> 25:06.696
because the trial about to begin.

25:37.071 --> 25:38.902
Stand-up

25:44.679 --> 25:46.408
You may be seated.

25:48.582 --> 25:50.550
The court is in session.

25:51.485 --> 25:53.783
Are you sure you want to take this forward?

25:55.122 --> 25:57.425
- No.
- The jury was chosen by a process ...

25:57.425 --> 25:59.994
Well, yes.

25:59.994 --> 26:01.518
She's OK.

26:02.530 --> 26:06.067
Since none of the parties accept an agreement,

26:06.067 --> 26:08.002
go to trial.

26:08.002 --> 26:10.971
And want it very quickly, get it?

26:11.572 --> 26:15.009
Have transformed our court to the media circus.

26:15.009 --> 26:17.445
Promoter, its preliminary statement.

26:17.445 --> 26:20.243
- Promoter!
- Yes, Your Honor.

26:24.785 --> 26:27.083
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

26:28.456 --> 26:31.492
I feel a little inadequate, after all ...

26:31.492 --> 26:34.729
I'm doing the devil himself.

26:34.729 --> 26:36.630
but...

26:36.630 --> 26:41.124
is very important to remember that the world is at stake here.

26:41.902 --> 26:44.972
And that this being has been the cause of all suffering in the world.

26:44.972 --> 26:47.475
Your Honor, I protest!

26:47.475 --> 26:52.777
My client is not a being, a fallen angel.

26:54.148 --> 26:56.844
Right. Carry on, Mr. O'Brian.

26:59.320 --> 27:04.658
That evil fallen angel is the cause of pain and suffering of the whole human race.

27:04.658 --> 27:06.494
Objection, Your Honor.

27:06.494 --> 27:09.725
He is assuming facts not yet proven.

27:10.398 --> 27:12.730
It assumes that Satan is evil.

27:13.868 --> 27:16.771
Denied. Carry on, Mr. O'Brian.

27:16.771 --> 27:18.506
Thank you, Your Honor.

27:18.506 --> 27:21.809
Prove, with a preponderance of evidence,

27:21.809 --> 27:25.746
he has caused all the problems and pains of this world.

27:25.746 --> 27:28.416
And the verdict should be against him,

27:28.416 --> 27:30.646
at 8 trillion dollars.

27:34.388 --> 27:36.686
"GOD IS DEAD"

27:36.924 --> 27:38.118
Order!

27:38.559 --> 27:39.890
Order!

27:43.130 --> 27:44.064
Order!

27:44.064 --> 27:47.802
Satan! Satan! Satan!

27:47.802 --> 27:49.360
Order!

27:49.937 --> 27:51.461
Order!

27:52.940 --> 27:56.808
Defense attorney, his preliminary statements.

28:02.716 --> 28:04.616
The audacity,

28:05.653 --> 28:07.922
was a tremendous audacity,

28:07.922 --> 28:12.426
make you my friends, leave their jobs

28:12.426 --> 28:15.095
trial for this nonsense.

28:15.095 --> 28:17.331
It's unbelievable!"
- Objection!

28:17.331 --> 28:21.335
Maintained. Defender, please, no personal attacks.

28:21.335 --> 28:22.503
Sorry, Your Honor.

28:22.503 --> 28:27.873
Assuming, just for argument, that my client is really Satan,

28:28.309 --> 28:33.414
prove that this man is not responsible

28:33.414 --> 28:35.749
the problems that man with society.

28:35.749 --> 28:40.020
And it is disturbing and reprehensible

28:40.020 --> 28:44.225
it processes this man who did him no harm.

28:44.225 --> 28:47.127
I finished. We can start the trial.

28:47.127 --> 28:49.618
Promoter, its first witness.

28:51.966 --> 28:53.661
Pastor Matthews,

28:54.735 --> 28:57.171
- Satan is real?
- Yes, it is.

28:57.171 --> 28:59.573
The Bible literally tells us so.

28:59.573 --> 29:03.210
The name of Satan is mentioned 47 times in Bible verses,

29:03.210 --> 29:05.513
- And the devil ...
- Objection, Your Honor.

29:05.513 --> 29:09.450
The Bible can not be admitted as evidence in court.

29:09.450 --> 29:10.818
Your Honor,

29:10.818 --> 29:15.623
the Bible is the historical source more reliable than any that exists.

29:15.623 --> 29:17.691
You can leave. There is even fiction.

29:17.691 --> 29:19.226
Continue, pastor.

29:19.226 --> 29:22.753
Be magnanimous. Let him use it. We will win it.

29:24.265 --> 29:28.769
Satan, when he tried to Jesus, called for three things:

29:28.769 --> 29:31.105
The temptation of the flesh,

29:31.105 --> 29:33.471
the temptation of the eyes,

29:34.642 --> 29:37.611
and pride that exists in man.

29:37.611 --> 29:39.713
And what is his mission?

29:39.713 --> 29:41.749
He opposes all that is good,

29:41.749 --> 29:45.583
and tries to destroy the work of Jesus Christ.

29:45.920 --> 29:47.655
That's right.

29:47.655 --> 29:50.886
Destroy the work of Jesus Christ.

29:52.626 --> 29:54.821
No further questions, Your Honor.

29:57.798 --> 30:00.000
What is it, Pastor?

30:00.000 --> 30:01.235
It is an apple.

30:01.235 --> 30:03.537
And if I said this is the apple

30:03.537 --> 30:06.507
bit that Eve in the Garden of Eden?

30:06.507 --> 30:08.676
{0}- Believe{/0} {1} me ...{/1}
- No.

30:08.676 --> 30:10.811
Why?
- Why the apple that Eve bit ...

30:10.811 --> 30:12.779
was full of worms now.

30:13.914 --> 30:15.916
Brilliant deduction.

30:15.916 --> 30:19.820
And there sat our client is guilty of destroying this man's life because ...

30:19.820 --> 30:25.059
The Scripture says that Satan is a roaring lion seeking who will devour.

30:25.059 --> 30:27.528
It seems to me very guilty.

30:27.528 --> 30:30.497
And this apple is not the Garden of Eden?

30:30.497 --> 30:33.200
I understand your question. Of course not.

30:33.200 --> 30:34.724
Of course.

30:38.572 --> 30:40.074
No further questions, Your Honor.

30:40.074 --> 30:43.110
We have high drama on the first day of this ...

30:43.110 --> 30:45.946
international trial live from Sydney, Australia.

30:45.946 --> 30:49.149
We welcome all who are watching us.

30:49.149 --> 30:50.918
Tony, comments?

30:50.918 --> 30:53.020
Of course, the lawyers of Satan are having fun today.

30:53.020 --> 30:55.089
This boy, Luke, I am sorry for him because they do not know what to do,

30:55.089 --> 30:58.718
and if not careful, they will eat lunch in Io.

30:59.593 --> 31:00.525
Jasmine?

31:01.662 --> 31:04.698
Let us not forget that mankind is at stake.

31:04.698 --> 31:07.668
That is a struggle of good against evil.

31:07.668 --> 31:10.262
Jasmine has understanding, okay?

31:11.505 --> 31:14.274
Satan is being processed, right?

31:14.274 --> 31:18.946
Satan is the one being attacked by this idiot

31:18.946 --> 31:22.549
which is threatening to put Iowa in prison.

31:22.549 --> 31:25.245
Please have a little sympathy.

31:26.854 --> 31:28.754
We will return soon after.

31:30.090 --> 31:33.992
Your Honor, I would call John Door of Petroleum Windmile to testify.

31:34.461 --> 31:38.932
Objection, Your Honor! What is the relevance of the witness, may I ask?

31:38.932 --> 31:40.834
Think man, think.

31:40.834 --> 31:44.065
Oil company, Satan, evil!

31:50.411 --> 31:53.881
- You are John Door, Windmile of Oil?
- Yes, I am.

31:53.881 --> 31:57.718
- Why are oil prices so high, sir?
- It's too high?

31:57.718 --> 31:59.820
I did not realize.

31:59.820 --> 32:03.017
Did not you notice? Is it so stupid?

32:04.191 --> 32:05.522
Your Honor!

32:05.926 --> 32:07.594
Sorry. Sorry.

32:07.594 --> 32:11.799
Promoter, no personal attacks. I clear?

32:11.799 --> 32:13.967
Yes, Your Honor. Sorry. Slipped.

32:13.967 --> 32:16.603
Your Honor, I want the record in the file

32:16.603 --> 32:20.641
that this observation was not only unpleasant anti-Christian

32:20.641 --> 32:24.133
as well as vile and evil.

32:25.612 --> 32:27.948
- Was observed.
Thank you!

32:27.948 --> 32:28.849
Continue."

32:28.849 --> 32:31.452
What you and all the other losers should do

32:31.452 --> 32:36.048
is to earn more money and stop complaining.

32:36.724 --> 32:38.826
Why do not you reduce the price of gasoline?

32:38.826 --> 32:42.796
Because of the money. We have to make a profit like everyone else.

32:42.796 --> 32:46.333
Your Honor, what is the relevance of this interrogation?

32:46.333 --> 32:49.069
Denied. Continue.

32:49.069 --> 32:51.672
Money is a vicious cycle.

32:51.672 --> 32:54.541
His company raises the price of oil by a few cents

32:54.541 --> 32:57.010
and then says that it is not a monopoly.

32:57.010 --> 33:00.481
After announcing that care about the environment

33:00.481 --> 33:02.349
and that are not making money.

33:02.349 --> 33:06.620
Only this year you earned $ 50 billion!

33:06.620 --> 33:09.823
Money and greed, is not it?

33:09.823 --> 33:12.760
Protest! Argumentative!

33:12.760 --> 33:14.661
- Forged!
- Ambiguous.

33:14.661 --> 33:18.432
What is the purpose, Mr. O'Brian, this questioning?

33:18.432 --> 33:21.502
The purpose? Show the love of money

33:21.502 --> 33:24.130
it is the root of all evil.

33:26.206 --> 33:28.876
- Protest again!
- Sustained.

33:28.876 --> 33:33.514
Promoter, enough personal attacks. You understand me?

33:33.514 --> 33:36.449
Yes, Your Honor. Sorry.

33:41.255 --> 33:45.025
Mr. Door, believe in God?

33:45.025 --> 33:46.424
No.

33:48.295 --> 33:49.489
Thank you."

33:50.130 --> 33:52.332
Let's take a short recess.

33:52.332 --> 33:53.767
Wow...

33:53.767 --> 33:57.371
Tony, it seems that Luke O'Brien came on a roll this afternoon.

33:57.371 --> 34:01.475
This guy amazes me. At a time is an idiot, and the following is a genius.

34:01.475 --> 34:04.678
That's right. I've just been informed that they are following us on ...

34:04.678 --> 34:08.649
more than 20 countries that broadcast this event around the world.

34:08.649 --> 34:13.286
Even in Pakistan, Hungary, Chile, Bolivia, Iraq,

34:13.286 --> 34:16.123
and believe it or not, Jasmine, in North Korea.

34:16.123 --> 34:20.694
It is. This tells me that there is much at stake in this trial,

34:20.694 --> 34:23.397
and my prayers are with Luke O'Brian.

34:23.397 --> 34:25.766
And he will need much prayer.

34:25.766 --> 34:28.393
We came back after the break.

34:30.304 --> 34:32.864
This was a dirty trick,

34:33.607 --> 34:37.710
cheap, rotten, Mr. O'Brian, and you know it.

34:37.710 --> 34:40.681
My client has nothing to do with the oil industry.

34:40.681 --> 34:44.585
Well, you can deny, but your client is Satan.

34:44.585 --> 34:47.554
- Have you thought about it?
- You're finished!

34:47.554 --> 34:48.922
When I am finished with you,

34:48.922 --> 34:53.126
may not exercise the right or the Antarctic.

34:53.126 --> 34:55.424
- Mint?
No, thank you.

35:05.072 --> 35:06.699
"What happened?"

35:07.307 --> 35:10.444
It's okay. Only a little threatened.

35:10.444 --> 35:12.980
- Oh, you threatened?
-Yes.

35:12.980 --> 35:16.643
I have a feeling we're missing.

35:17.184 --> 35:18.913
Look, do not worry!

35:19.720 --> 35:22.389
I never tell me not to worry!

35:22.389 --> 35:26.052
It's good to finish it the next chance, okay?

35:26.827 --> 35:28.920
You have not seen my bad side.

35:29.563 --> 35:31.121
Stand-up

35:32.366 --> 35:35.961
Your Honor, the defense called to testify Luke O'Brian.

35:36.837 --> 35:39.328
- Why are you calling now?
- I can not imagine.

35:47.915 --> 35:49.576
Mr. O'Brian,

35:50.517 --> 35:54.180
know what it means audacity?

35:54.922 --> 35:56.014
Yes.

35:57.324 --> 35:58.792
"Great!

35:58.792 --> 36:04.364
And do not think audacity to use the precious time of the jurors

36:04.364 --> 36:07.663
ridiculous with your process?

36:10.938 --> 36:11.838
No.

36:11.838 --> 36:16.677
How can you sit there with this guy jerk

36:16.677 --> 36:19.246
and not have an ounce of shame?

36:19.246 --> 36:23.650
Protest! He is suppressing the witness.

36:23.650 --> 36:27.888
Repressing the witness? What is this? I have never heard this kind of protest.

36:27.888 --> 36:31.016
Learned that in the course of law by correspondence?

36:34.194 --> 36:35.929
What comes next?

36:35.929 --> 36:40.133
Protest, he is not using deodorant and smells bad now.

36:40.133 --> 36:43.904
Protest, he called me a bad name and made me cry!

36:43.904 --> 36:45.371
____Enough already!

36:48.408 --> 36:50.644
No further questions, Your Honor.

36:50.644 --> 36:53.875
Pass the word to my co-counsel. Thank you.

36:54.381 --> 36:57.976
- How about these dirty tricks?
- Were not low enough.

36:58.752 --> 37:00.617
And how far should we go?

37:03.423 --> 37:06.256
As low as hell.

37:11.665 --> 37:15.135
- Your Honor, we can make a withdrawal?
-Why?

37:15.135 --> 37:17.170
I need to discuss something with my colleagues.

37:17.170 --> 37:19.798
Be quick, two minutes.

37:21.675 --> 37:26.646
Wow, it seems the jury is siding with Satan.

37:26.646 --> 37:29.716
I do not know how he can sit there and catch the defense lawyers.

37:29.716 --> 37:33.153
And why would Satan bother to defend himself?

37:33.153 --> 37:37.324
Listen, you moron, he will not have a free time?

37:37.324 --> 37:42.091
I know when someone is real or not, and he really is. He is Satan himself.

37:43.463 --> 37:46.523
Never call me silly.

37:48.735 --> 37:50.760
- Finish him.
Yes, sir.

37:54.274 --> 37:57.711
I apologize for my co-counsel, Mr. O'Brian.

37:57.711 --> 38:00.647
Sometimes he exaggerates a little.

38:00.647 --> 38:04.777
A simple question, Mr. O'Brian. Do you believe in God?

38:05.552 --> 38:07.254
Yes, I believe.

38:07.254 --> 38:09.848
And believe in Satan?

38:10.357 --> 38:11.925
But of course.

38:11.925 --> 38:15.383
Likes Satan?

38:16.229 --> 38:20.359
What a silly question is that? Why do I sue someone I like?

38:21.168 --> 38:22.294
Order!

38:23.170 --> 38:24.704
You're right.

38:24.704 --> 38:29.910
But do not think that is a lot of blaming?

38:29.910 --> 38:32.479
Satan is behind everything.

38:32.479 --> 38:33.747
Really?

38:33.747 --> 38:36.550
I have in my hands a statement.

38:36.550 --> 38:40.854
When her mother died, a nurse heard him say:

38:40.854 --> 38:43.723
"God, how could you have let this happen to me?"

38:43.723 --> 38:45.384
You said that?

38:46.293 --> 38:47.590
What do you think?"

38:49.629 --> 38:52.165
Not great, but a little better.

38:52.165 --> 38:55.168
You are content with little, right?

38:55.168 --> 38:58.660
I want this brat is destroyed.

39:01.842 --> 39:04.111
He said that, Mr. O'Brien?

39:04.111 --> 39:05.412
Yes, I said.

39:05.412 --> 39:11.284
He said: "God, how could you have let this happen to me?"

39:11.284 --> 39:13.548
Note that I emphasized the word you.

39:15.388 --> 39:17.157
Yes, you're getting at?

39:17.157 --> 39:21.116
You were not blaming God and Satan, right?

39:24.598 --> 39:25.724
Order!

39:26.299 --> 39:31.259
Order! I will not allow such disrespect in my court. Thank you.

39:33.540 --> 39:35.940
No further questions, Your Honor.

39:41.148 --> 39:42.482
Order!

39:42.482 --> 39:44.017
Order!

39:44.017 --> 39:45.252
Order!

39:45.252 --> 39:50.490
If I hear that noise again, everyone must evacuate the cut, get it?

39:50.490 --> 39:52.014
Mr. Wilson: Hi yes Id consider selling direct to you! The skirt is on its way & was posted so should reach you soon!! I will look up the delivery slip to see if I can see when it will be delivered & get back to you. Kindest Regards LOLITA J

40:00.767 --> 40:02.860
Why did I get myself into this?

40:04.171 --> 40:07.407
That lawyer was right today.

40:07.407 --> 40:09.068
About what?

40:10.377 --> 40:12.345
I blamed God ...

40:13.313 --> 40:15.110
the death of my mother.

40:16.283 --> 40:19.085
Need not be blaming themselves for it.

40:19.085 --> 40:23.886
So many people question God in this life.

40:24.324 --> 40:26.224
Yeah, but he caught me at all.

40:27.861 --> 40:30.897
God could easily prevent her death,

40:30.897 --> 40:32.421
but not avoided.

40:41.308 --> 40:44.937
Your Honor, I call Satan to testify.

41:04.598 --> 41:07.901
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?

41:07.901 --> 41:10.904
But this does not apply to me!

41:10.904 --> 41:15.742
Are you saying that for religious reasons refuses to take the oath?

41:15.742 --> 41:18.370
I'm not religious.

41:23.783 --> 41:25.842
Admits to being Satan?

41:27.887 --> 41:32.525
Do not admit anything, I see nothing, hear nothing.

41:32.525 --> 41:36.196
He admits that is the evil being who chased Eve?

41:36.196 --> 41:38.732
Protest. It is based on unproven facts.

41:38.732 --> 41:41.234
It was not established that Satan is evil.

41:41.234 --> 41:44.371
- And it's leading the witness, Your Honor.
- It is also irrelevant, Your Honor.

41:44.371 --> 41:48.671
Protest denied. Now all feel.

41:50.744 --> 41:54.414
I do not chase Eve, right?

41:54.414 --> 41:56.883
In fact, she came to me.

41:56.883 --> 42:02.355
Just as you, Luke, again and again.

42:02.355 --> 42:05.592
Sorry, but I never tried.

42:05.592 --> 42:08.595
I think the scriptures are quite clear:

42:08.595 --> 42:12.292
"He who loves this world is the enemy of God."

42:12.899 --> 42:15.368
Think of all those who worked so hard at times

42:15.368 --> 42:20.640
to buy video games instead of praying to God.

42:20.640 --> 42:23.777
Now, come on. Admit the truth.

42:23.777 --> 42:26.813
You came to me several times.

42:26.813 --> 42:30.383
I want to talk about that October night in the hospital.

42:30.383 --> 42:33.147
The night my mother was hit by a drunk driver.

42:33.853 --> 42:36.456
____I do not remember...
- Shortly before she died,

42:36.456 --> 42:40.093
- I knew you were there.
____I do not remember...

42:40.093 --> 42:42.996
Do not you remember? Do not remember anything, right?

42:42.996 --> 42:46.591
Now, I'm not dwelling on negative thoughts.

42:47.434 --> 42:50.003
Or insignificant.

42:50.003 --> 42:51.595
Negligible

42:52.172 --> 42:57.410
- My mother was not insignificant!
- Now I know what it is.

42:57.410 --> 43:00.814
All this is because his mother died

43:00.814 --> 43:04.150
before you tell her I loved her.

43:04.150 --> 43:05.418
It is not true.

43:05.418 --> 43:09.222
How he must have felt guilty for being a bad son.

43:09.222 --> 43:13.126
And that time you tore the Bible and threw it in the trash, huh?

43:13.126 --> 43:18.264
As you were good. He showed it to her and God.

43:18.264 --> 43:20.433
Stop, I'm saying.

43:20.433 --> 43:23.103
- Oh, Luke!
- Stop talking about my mother!

43:23.103 --> 43:27.507
She raised you so well and died so young, poor.

43:27.507 --> 43:28.908
Safety
- I'll kill you!

43:28.908 --> 43:31.378
Safety
- Do not talk about my mother!

43:31.378 --> 43:33.813
I have not spoken of his mother!

43:33.813 --> 43:36.249
Look at this boy, Your Honor. Look at him.

43:36.249 --> 43:38.318
Sounds like a Christian?

43:38.318 --> 43:40.286
It seems to be a Christian to you?

43:40.286 --> 43:41.855
- Mr. O'Brian!
- I'll kill you!

43:41.855 --> 43:43.289
Do not talk about my mother!

43:43.289 --> 43:44.813
- Order!
- Wide!

43:45.658 --> 43:48.428
- Order!
- I did not tell his mother!

43:48.428 --> 43:51.231
- Mr. O'Brian!
- This is not a Christian.

43:51.231 --> 43:53.967
- This man is a barbarian.
- Mr. O'Brian!

43:53.967 --> 43:57.804
If you lose control again in this court, I'll have you arrested for contempt-Io.

43:57.804 --> 44:00.073
Let go of me! Let go of me!

44:00.073 --> 44:02.871
- Do you understand?
- Yes, Your Honor.

44:05.645 --> 44:08.239
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

44:09.149 --> 44:11.084
- It's okay.
- My mother was a saint.

44:11.084 --> 44:13.075
Okay, apology accepted.

44:13.987 --> 44:15.555
My mother was a saint.

44:15.555 --> 44:18.091
I'm sure yes.

44:18.091 --> 44:22.729
But is not my fault, is it? You can not blame me.

44:22.729 --> 44:24.663
Think, Luke. Think.

44:25.198 --> 44:27.257
No further questions.

44:27.734 --> 44:31.438
- Let's take a short recess.
- Hey, boy! Luke!

44:31.438 --> 44:33.565
A small recess!

44:41.581 --> 44:46.352
Do not forget, we have to win the jury, okay?

44:46.352 --> 44:51.289
This seems like a nightmare. I can not get out.

44:52.292 --> 44:53.520
I..."

44:57.530 --> 44:58.724
"Hey!

45:01.401 --> 45:04.370
YOU DECIDE THE VERDICT WITH BARRY POLK

45:04.804 --> 45:08.007
Well, well, well. What do you think that?

45:08.007 --> 45:10.844
Well, if you want my opinion, Barry, this guy ...

45:10.844 --> 45:14.211
have a screw loose in his head.

45:14.547 --> 45:18.818
Yeah, but Satan convinced the jury that it was not responsible for the death of the mother of Mr. O'Brian.

45:18.818 --> 45:22.021
Of course! The jerk blame everyone but himself.

45:22.021 --> 45:24.390
It's pathetic. It's even worth looking at it.

45:24.390 --> 45:26.025
Jasmine, any comments?

45:26.025 --> 45:30.096
Why all this love for Satan? We are talking about Lucifer

45:30.096 --> 45:32.365
the monster that caused the downfall of all mankind,

45:32.365 --> 45:35.401
and you are finding great that Satan is winning. What is this?

45:35.401 --> 45:38.605
Well, folks. Let's be civilized, we will maintain order.

45:38.605 --> 45:41.641
First, that is not Satan.

45:41.641 --> 45:43.939
You know how I know? I've seen Satan.

45:46.045 --> 45:50.038
Wait, you saw Satan?

45:53.453 --> 45:55.421
Okay, guys, sorry we can ...

45:55.421 --> 45:58.625
I think the audience would like to stick to legal matters.

45:58.625 --> 46:04.120
In short, Barry, Luke is weak, is no match for Satan.

46:07.500 --> 46:09.730
Very well. What we do now?

46:10.036 --> 46:13.139
- Now the fight will heat up.
- That's what I want to hear.

46:13.139 --> 46:18.478
That's what I want to hear. I want to play low, low, low.

46:18.478 --> 46:21.447
I destroyed this guy.

46:21.447 --> 46:26.146
The court is again in session. Promoter continue.

46:27.487 --> 46:28.954
Promoter?

46:33.927 --> 46:36.953
The prosecution called to testify Satan.

46:40.366 --> 46:42.869
In the Bible, the Book of Job,

46:42.869 --> 46:47.329
Job you attack both physically and spiritually. Why is that?

46:48.875 --> 46:53.869
Finally an intelligent question in this court.

46:54.914 --> 46:58.217
The short answer is:

46:58.217 --> 47:01.015
Because I wanted to try Io.

47:01.721 --> 47:04.357
And he passed his test?

47:04.357 --> 47:08.461
Yes, I know it's hard to believe, but he passed.

47:08.461 --> 47:14.000
And that does not prove that you are responsible for the suffering of at least one person?

47:14.000 --> 47:15.592
"Maybe.

47:16.302 --> 47:21.841
So why can not be responsible for the suffering of the world?

47:21.841 --> 47:25.044
Your Honor, I protest. Is leading the witness.

47:25.044 --> 47:28.207
Denied. The witness may answer the question.

47:30.116 --> 47:32.418
See, I'm not omnipresent.

47:32.418 --> 47:36.022
I can not be in two places at once. Only God can.

47:36.022 --> 47:39.192
God could stop me at any time, but did not.

47:39.192 --> 47:42.662
You should do these questions to him.

47:42.662 --> 47:48.294
By the way, what does that say about the mighty up there?

47:48.501 --> 47:51.871
If he can prevent evil and does not,

47:51.871 --> 47:54.669
what does that say about him?

47:55.108 --> 47:58.945
I think this tells me that He gave free will to all.

47:58.945 --> 48:02.548
Protest. She can not answer the questions of the witness.

48:02.548 --> 48:05.618
I agree. Please keep your opinions to yourself.

48:05.618 --> 48:07.085
Of course, Your Honor.

48:08.321 --> 48:10.221
"Any more questions?"

48:11.257 --> 48:12.349
No.

48:17.930 --> 48:20.421
Bailiff! Bailiff, do something!

48:24.303 --> 48:28.274
Stay calm, please. How did ...

48:28.274 --> 48:31.072
Bailiff, take the court this thing!

48:34.113 --> 48:36.673
She must have entered by ventilation, Your Honor.

48:39.285 --> 48:41.082
Calm down everyone.

48:46.559 --> 48:48.361
- What is your next move?
"Hey guys!"

48:48.361 --> 48:50.530
need a little time, okay?

48:50.530 --> 48:52.225
Just have to go to the bathroom.

48:53.066 --> 48:54.226
Thank you."

49:05.478 --> 49:07.412
Waiting for?

49:07.714 --> 49:09.375
Wait a few minutes.

49:10.383 --> 49:11.975
I ate oysters spoiled.

49:12.852 --> 49:15.218
Why did you come to defend themselves?

49:15.922 --> 49:18.254
Why did you want to sue me?

49:19.692 --> 49:21.861
I did not think you'd show up.

49:21.861 --> 49:25.865
Do not think I'd show up? What else is saying stupid!

49:25.865 --> 49:27.492
So why did he appear?

49:27.934 --> 49:30.670
I am here to defend my honor.

49:30.670 --> 49:32.872
His honor? You're a snake.

49:32.872 --> 49:37.443
Be careful, O'Brian. Can I sue you for libel.

49:37.443 --> 49:40.580
The truth is a defense against libel.

49:40.580 --> 49:44.183
Yes, of course. I forgot you know the law, is not it?

49:44.183 --> 49:47.787
Okay. Call me a snake.

49:47.787 --> 49:52.019
Actually, I like snakes. Have you eaten?

49:53.092 --> 49:57.296
You know, I can not understand is why he turned against God.

49:57.296 --> 50:00.533
You were the leader of worship, was a beautiful angel,

50:00.533 --> 50:03.603
- And threw it all away.
- I did not throw anything away.

50:03.603 --> 50:05.505
Actually, you know,

50:05.505 --> 50:07.707
I am very attractive, is not it?

50:07.707 --> 50:11.444
Listen, I like to just talk in the past,

50:11.444 --> 50:14.140
but if you want a direct answer,

50:14.781 --> 50:17.807
I thought I ...

50:18.351 --> 50:20.342
be God.

50:21.821 --> 50:23.189
What a mistake.

50:23.189 --> 50:26.125
Still not finished, buddy.

50:26.125 --> 50:29.228
And now wants revenge on humans?

50:29.228 --> 50:33.166
I want to ask you something. Why are not you afraid?

50:33.166 --> 50:34.934
Fear? Fear of what?

50:34.934 --> 50:39.105
Now, I was in who made Jesus Christ was crucified.

50:39.105 --> 50:42.008
Think about that!
- Oh, you think!

50:42.008 --> 50:44.677
You see, Jesus gave himself on the cross

50:44.677 --> 50:48.748
and that was the biggest mistake of his life, "buddy."

50:48.748 --> 50:52.741
Remember the Garden of Gethsemane?

50:53.286 --> 50:58.246
All the disciples fell asleep and he had no one to turn to.

50:59.325 --> 51:03.796
Yet he was until the end is unbelievable!

51:03.796 --> 51:08.234
Yes, what a great man! That's why I owe so much to him.

51:08.234 --> 51:12.872
Listen, you moron. You will lose this case,

51:12.872 --> 51:15.708
will be the laughing stock of the world.

51:15.708 --> 51:17.710
Even children will point at you and say:

51:17.710 --> 51:21.146
"That's not the idiot who tried to sue Satan?"

51:23.816 --> 51:26.719
Listen, do not talk to this idiot without my presence.

51:26.719 --> 51:28.187
Do not do this, please.

51:28.187 --> 51:32.124
- Everything is under control, Mr. Banks?
- Of course it is.

51:32.124 --> 51:34.558
Remember that we do not lose ever.

51:35.228 --> 51:40.165
Great. Do not ever say that to me.

51:44.871 --> 51:46.304
Have a nice day.

51:50.943 --> 51:52.979
Would it be correct to say that ...

51:52.979 --> 51:57.814
you left school because they do not stand the pressure?

51:59.318 --> 52:00.620
Yes.

52:00.620 --> 52:04.657
And that was the fault of Satan?

52:04.657 --> 52:06.893
No, it was mine.

52:06.893 --> 52:08.694
- Was his.
-Yes.

52:08.694 --> 52:12.131
And is currently studying at ...

52:12.131 --> 52:14.934
Doctor, please do not put your hand on the witness.

52:14.934 --> 52:18.271
Sorry, Your Honor. He reminds me of my son.

52:18.271 --> 52:19.238
So:

52:19.238 --> 52:25.768
How can we compare the night course Billy's right to other universities?

52:26.946 --> 52:28.345
How do I know?

52:28.781 --> 52:33.085
Well, I graduated in law from Harvard. As can be compared to yours?

52:33.085 --> 52:34.887
Protest!

52:34.887 --> 52:37.390
Is protesting against his own lawyer?

52:37.390 --> 52:41.160
Your Honor, I would turn to my lawyer if possible.

52:41.160 --> 52:44.027
Please come here.

52:45.564 --> 52:48.100
How dare you ridicule this man in front of everyone?

52:48.100 --> 52:51.671
- Just wanted to show that ...
- So what if it is Harvard?

52:51.671 --> 52:56.876
Big deal! Nobody cares! Listen, I'm the boss, not you.

52:56.876 --> 53:00.746
We are here to represent the man there. It's not your show.

53:00.746 --> 53:02.748
You know what? Go away!

53:02.748 --> 53:04.511
What?"
- You're fired!

53:09.221 --> 53:13.626
Your Honor, excuse my outburst, I'm sorry.

53:13.626 --> 53:17.730
With the permission of the court, I'd like to replace the co-champion Iowa.

53:17.730 --> 53:20.967
- The lovely Miss. Scarlett.
- Replacement accepted.

53:20.967 --> 53:23.697
Thank you!
- Proceed with the questioning, please.

53:31.077 --> 53:32.510
Good trick.

53:33.012 --> 53:35.412
You have not seen anything.

53:37.183 --> 53:39.785
We are losing the cause, Luke. Have you noticed that?

53:39.785 --> 53:41.887
Yes, I noticed.

53:41.887 --> 53:45.345
I can not believe the jury is on the side of Satan.

53:45.858 --> 53:49.195
Wow, my name will be cited as the worst lawyer in history.

53:49.195 --> 53:51.564
Luke, it is misleading to the jury.

53:51.564 --> 53:53.265
It is the same.

53:53.265 --> 53:56.135
I know that. He even fooled me.

53:56.135 --> 53:58.160
____What can I do?

53:59.705 --> 54:01.841
I asked: "Are you okay?"
- Yes, I'm fine.

54:01.841 --> 54:03.175
- Are you sure?
-Yes.

54:03.175 --> 54:06.872
- Are you ready to act in the way of the Lord?
- The way of the Lord?

54:07.613 --> 54:11.450
I thought I was doing it. I am suing the devil, if you have not noticed.

54:11.450 --> 54:13.652
For whose glory? His or his?

54:13.652 --> 54:18.055
Honey, it's a little more complicated than that. You do not understand.

54:18.257 --> 54:21.160
You know, the funny thing is that most people

54:21.160 --> 54:24.597
lock a spiritual battle every day of their lives

54:24.597 --> 54:29.402
and continue to live their lives without thinking about what God wants for them.

54:29.402 --> 54:31.170
What do you mean?

54:31.170 --> 54:35.841
I want to say that Satan does not care for those who are too busy for God.

54:35.841 --> 54:39.242
Only care about those who are too busy to Satan.

54:40.980 --> 54:43.505
Hello!
- Are you going to testify today?

54:44.183 --> 54:46.852
Just want to say that this is my statement:

54:46.852 --> 54:51.857
The trial became a battle of good against evil.

54:51.857 --> 54:55.895
I have nothing personal against Mr. Luke O'Brien,

54:55.895 --> 54:58.964
it is a wrong with the Bible, that's all.

54:58.964 --> 55:02.127
Even so, it will be an interesting battle. Thank you.

55:03.769 --> 55:06.105
You have 8 trillion in the bank in case you lose?

55:06.105 --> 55:07.907
Why? Need a loan?

55:07.907 --> 55:10.109
Mr. Satan, can you tell us what hell is like?

55:10.109 --> 55:13.738
I can. It is very hot. Want to go there to see?

55:14.213 --> 55:16.181
If it is Satan, then prove it.

55:20.119 --> 55:21.552
What happened to him?

55:37.937 --> 55:39.529
THE END OF THE WORLD

55:43.542 --> 55:45.544
Hey, blind man,

55:45.544 --> 55:48.013
really think the end is near?

55:48.013 --> 55:51.505
I believe that Jesus will return soon, yes.

55:51.984 --> 55:56.021
- And why is that?
- I am blind, but I can see.

55:56.021 --> 55:59.125
The book of Luke says, "Be careful not to be deceived.

55:59.125 --> 56:01.961
For many virÃ£oo in my name, saying, 'I am! '

56:01.961 --> 56:04.897
- Yes, I know. Thank you.
- 'This Time' pro'ximo '.

56:04.897 --> 56:10.202
He said to them: "Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.

56:10.202 --> 56:14.874
There will be great earthquakes, famines and pestilences in various places. "

56:14.874 --> 56:19.311
I really believe that we are the generation ÃºItima.

56:27.653 --> 56:31.724
Congratulations. It sounds like it will be a cakewalk.

56:31.724 --> 56:34.393
It is even a breeze?

56:34.393 --> 56:37.596
- Something wrong?
- No, no.

56:37.596 --> 56:41.634
Remember that blind out there?

56:41.634 --> 56:45.004
- Blind?
- It is. Where will he go?

56:45.004 --> 56:47.907
We tie the jury.

56:47.907 --> 56:51.510
This case is won if we do not spoil everything.

56:51.510 --> 56:54.138
- We bind all, huh?
- Tied.

56:55.147 --> 56:56.649
You know?

56:56.649 --> 56:59.485
I think we have to change the strategy.

56:59.485 --> 57:01.419
Stand-up

57:16.135 --> 57:18.228
Can you explain evil?

57:19.638 --> 57:21.367
Did you hear my question?

57:21.974 --> 57:23.032
Yes.

57:24.076 --> 57:25.338
So:

57:26.378 --> 57:29.677
Evil is good.

57:31.817 --> 57:34.809
Are you saying that evil is good?

57:35.421 --> 57:38.157
You still do not understand, is not it?

57:38.157 --> 57:40.626
There would be no good without evil

57:40.626 --> 57:44.163
and hence no evil without good.

57:44.163 --> 57:45.798
So Ezekiel ...

57:45.798 --> 57:47.533
- Ezekiel?
-Yes.

57:47.533 --> 57:50.102
- One of my favorites.
"Oh, yes.

57:50.102 --> 57:53.239
He said a beautiful thing about you. Say you were a leader of worship,

57:53.239 --> 57:55.808
anointed as a guardian cherub,

57:55.808 --> 57:59.445
you were on the holy mountain of God,

57:59.445 --> 58:02.548
- And walked among the fiery stones.
- Sparkling stones.

58:02.548 --> 58:04.850
- Sparkling stones.
-Yes.

58:04.850 --> 58:06.518
-Yes.
So what?

58:06.518 --> 58:09.321
So what? So you thought like God,

58:09.321 --> 58:12.313
and that was a silly, right?

58:13.792 --> 58:17.463
What kind of question is that, Your Honor?

58:17.463 --> 58:18.657
Your Honor!

58:19.331 --> 58:22.668
- Who is Jesus to you?
- What?

58:22.668 --> 58:25.704
I said: Who is Jesus Christ?

58:25.704 --> 58:27.973
Your Honor, what does this have to do with it?

58:27.973 --> 58:29.742
Objection, Your Honor.

58:29.742 --> 58:33.412
- Where do you want to go with it?
- Denied. Continue.

58:33.412 --> 58:34.713
Your Honor, please.

58:34.713 --> 58:38.350
Would you please sit down and be quiet?

58:38.350 --> 58:39.544
Got it?

58:40.119 --> 58:41.746
Thank you, doctor.

58:43.022 --> 58:46.082
Who is Jesus Christ?

58:49.962 --> 58:52.226
Witness, answer the question.

58:52.765 --> 58:53.925
Yes, Your Honor.

58:54.733 --> 58:56.030
Jesus Christ.

58:56.802 --> 58:57.826
She's OK.

58:59.972 --> 59:02.641
He was a good teacher, that's all. Nothing more.

59:02.641 --> 59:06.445
It was a good teacher? I do not remember him saying anything.

59:06.445 --> 59:08.981
Okay, he said he was God.

59:08.981 --> 59:12.284
- Sorry, what did he say?
- Great stuff!

59:12.284 --> 59:13.552
You heard me.

59:13.552 --> 59:17.283
He said that was what? Sorry, but you can repeat to the jury and the court?

59:18.090 --> 59:19.625
Have not you heard?

59:19.625 --> 59:23.962
I will not repeat. If you have wax in your ears, go clean.

59:23.962 --> 59:28.922
But the worst mistake of his life was crucify Io, was not it?

59:29.501 --> 59:31.637
It's good to take care of that speech, boy.

59:31.637 --> 59:34.197
He thought he had thought of everything, right?

59:36.709 --> 59:39.906
Be careful what you say, boy.

59:42.514 --> 59:46.473
Look around you. What do you see?

01:00:02.868 --> 01:00:07.931
I've looked at. Why do not you look now? What do you see?

01:00:16.315 --> 01:00:17.950
Who are you?

01:00:17.950 --> 01:00:20.886
I am a believer in Jesus Christ

01:00:20.886 --> 01:00:23.980
and love God. That's all I have to be.

01:00:24.990 --> 01:00:28.482
Excuse me, Mr. O'Brian. Any more questions?

01:00:28.794 --> 01:00:33.732
Wow! Here we are, another round of events. What do you think?

01:00:33.732 --> 01:00:37.532
I think I never will see such a thing in our lives.

01:00:38.070 --> 01:00:39.469
"What happened?"

01:00:40.839 --> 01:00:42.534
This loser!

01:00:43.308 --> 01:00:47.802
Okay, let's fight. From now on, it's war.

01:00:55.821 --> 01:00:57.982
Where did this come from?

01:00:58.957 --> 01:01:00.322
I don't know.

01:01:01.860 --> 01:01:02.986
It was like ...

01:01:04.163 --> 01:01:05.528
He waits a little...)

01:01:09.301 --> 01:01:10.325
"Hey!

01:01:12.504 --> 01:01:15.107
I asked: "Are you okay?"
-Yes.

01:01:15.107 --> 01:01:17.075
I'm just a headache.

01:01:18.143 --> 01:01:19.542
Don't worry.

01:01:24.783 --> 01:01:27.650
Silence in court. All rise.

01:01:28.787 --> 01:01:30.721
The court is in session.

01:01:31.390 --> 01:01:32.880
You may be seated.

01:01:33.959 --> 01:01:36.325
Let me make one thing clear.

01:01:36.662 --> 01:01:41.066
Do not want to cry in court.

01:01:41.066 --> 01:01:42.761
Understood?

01:01:43.535 --> 01:01:45.662
Great. Can proceed.

01:01:49.408 --> 01:01:54.038
Mr. O'Brian, has seen pornography on the internet?

01:01:57.783 --> 01:02:00.581
-Yes.
- How many times?

01:02:03.355 --> 01:02:05.023
I don't know.

01:02:05.023 --> 01:02:05.923
How about 341 times?

01:02:10.362 --> 01:02:12.865
- It would be a precise number?
- Objection!

01:02:12.865 --> 01:02:14.600
Your Honor, this is irrelevant.

01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:18.400
- Irrelevant? I think not.
- Denied. Continue.

01:02:19.905 --> 01:02:21.600
Maybe that's the number.

01:02:22.708 --> 01:02:25.444
But not after I got married.

01:02:25.444 --> 01:02:30.048
And during that period, there were wars in Afghanistan,

01:02:30.048 --> 01:02:33.252
Somalia, Iraq,

01:02:33.252 --> 01:02:37.356
children were killed, a boy lost his mother.

01:02:37.356 --> 01:02:40.392
Excuse me. Where are getting at?

01:02:40.392 --> 01:02:45.230
I just want to know if Mr. O'Brien knew of these events.

01:02:45.230 --> 01:02:47.332
Yes, I know.

01:02:47.332 --> 01:02:52.170
So tell me. Why you chose Satan

01:02:52.170 --> 01:02:54.934
instead of the other events?

01:02:57.142 --> 01:02:59.478
Well, he probably did not choose.

01:02:59.478 --> 01:03:01.070
____It was my fault!

01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:06.318
My and my carnal desires.

01:03:06.318 --> 01:03:10.589
So Satan is not to blame for his carnal desires?

01:03:10.589 --> 01:03:11.920
No.

01:03:12.558 --> 01:03:16.824
We have to work out our salvation every day. Day by day.

01:03:23.502 --> 01:03:25.970
How they got that information, Luke?

01:03:27.439 --> 01:03:28.974
I don't know.

01:03:28.974 --> 01:03:33.138
Gwen knew the story of the internet?

01:03:37.382 --> 01:03:38.684
No.

01:03:38.684 --> 01:03:42.245
- Luke, I'm sorry.
- Look, give me a minute, okay?

01:03:42.955 --> 01:03:44.445
I'm fine.

01:03:45.057 --> 01:03:46.692
Luke,

01:03:46.692 --> 01:03:49.525
you think this man is really Satan?

01:03:50.696 --> 01:03:54.063
The session is reopened. Witness to testify again, please.

01:03:57.703 --> 01:03:59.466
Sorry. Yes, Your Honor.

01:04:05.444 --> 01:04:11.550
Mr. O'Brien, you said or not said a word

01:04:11.550 --> 01:04:13.318
when someone off in traffic last week?

01:04:13.318 --> 01:04:16.088
Protest! This is just a guess, Your Honor.

01:04:16.088 --> 01:04:18.557
Where did you get this information?

01:04:18.557 --> 01:04:21.727
We have a recording, we can show the jury.

01:04:21.727 --> 01:04:23.462
And who was in the car to save it?

01:04:23.462 --> 01:04:27.866
Your Honor, as we present this as proof.

01:04:27.866 --> 01:04:32.604
We received a phone recording of Mr. O'Brian.

01:04:32.604 --> 01:04:33.739
Say what?

01:04:33.739 --> 01:04:36.775
Some phones transmit such recordings

01:04:36.775 --> 01:04:41.747
and that is why we have the recording of the cell of Mr. O'Brian.

01:04:41.747 --> 01:04:44.216
We have already presented as evidence.

01:04:44.216 --> 01:04:46.818
Yes, right here.

01:04:46.818 --> 01:04:49.286
That's odd. Continue.

01:04:50.188 --> 01:04:53.325
- You said ...
- Yes! Yes, I said.

01:04:53.325 --> 01:04:58.063
- That fellow I shut ...
- Yes or no, Mr. O'Brien?

01:04:58.063 --> 01:04:59.431
Yes.

01:04:59.431 --> 01:05:04.664
And you made a racist comment last week?

01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:09.803
Yes.

01:05:10.208 --> 01:05:13.378
- What do you say?
____I do not remember...

01:05:13.378 --> 01:05:15.539
And when did it become a Christian?

01:05:16.581 --> 01:05:20.919
I accepted Jesus Christ in my heart for 7 years.

01:05:20.919 --> 01:05:23.121
7 years old:

01:05:23.121 --> 01:05:27.114
And swears and makes racist comments.

01:05:29.861 --> 01:05:31.385
No further questions.

01:05:32.130 --> 01:05:34.399
Mr. O'Brian, other racist comments that you said?

01:05:34.399 --> 01:05:38.203
- Are you racist?
- He is a member of the Ku Klux Klan?

01:05:38.203 --> 01:05:40.972
What kind of man you are? If you think even a Christian?

01:05:40.972 --> 01:05:42.441
Please excuse me now.

01:05:42.441 --> 01:05:44.705
How does it feel to see what's missing?

01:05:45.744 --> 01:05:47.268
It is true that going to divorce?

01:05:49.247 --> 01:05:52.317
Have you felt so down ...

01:05:52.317 --> 01:05:55.654
he no longer has to turn to except to heaven?

01:05:55.654 --> 01:05:57.485
Lord God,

01:05:58.724 --> 01:06:02.216
I acknowledge that I have blamed everyone but me.

01:06:02.694 --> 01:06:07.599
I even blame Satan, but did not see my own shortcomings,

01:06:07.599 --> 01:06:10.068
my own flesh.

01:06:10.068 --> 01:06:12.971
Forgive me, Lord. Forgive me.

01:06:12.971 --> 01:06:15.872
Because of all the people of this land,

01:06:16.374 --> 01:06:19.366
I am the biggest hypocrite

01:06:20.045 --> 01:06:22.013
and the worst sinner.

01:06:24.916 --> 01:06:29.121
Give me another chance to do the right thing the right way,

01:06:29.121 --> 01:06:31.885
of Thy way, Thy will.

01:06:32.991 --> 01:06:35.152
I want to win this cause.

01:06:39.598 --> 01:06:43.735
Barry, most experts agree that this case is lost.

01:06:43.735 --> 01:06:47.272
Luke O'Brien lost the jury and lost the case.

01:06:47.272 --> 01:06:50.142
Amazing. Then his past came to torment Io.

01:06:50.142 --> 01:06:51.777
Yes, that's right.

01:06:51.777 --> 01:06:54.012
Now let's talk to Mark, live in London.

01:06:54.012 --> 01:06:57.675
Mark, what is the consensus among people here in England?

01:06:58.250 --> 01:07:03.622
Barry, most people I talked to agree that Luke O'Brien is a hypocrite.

01:07:03.622 --> 01:07:07.217
He is suing the devil when he should sue himself.

01:07:13.932 --> 01:07:16.768
God anointed Jesus of Nazareth

01:07:16.768 --> 01:07:20.505
with the power of the Holy Spirit to do good

01:07:20.505 --> 01:07:24.042
and healing all who were under the dominion of the devil,

01:07:24.042 --> 01:07:25.066
that ...

01:07:26.511 --> 01:07:29.414
- What does this mean to you?
- Wow, you're amazing.

01:07:29.414 --> 01:07:32.781
He spoke this mantra all day, is not it?

01:07:34.553 --> 01:07:36.454
What does this mean for me?

01:07:36.454 --> 01:07:40.754
Absolutely nothing. At all.

01:07:42.260 --> 01:07:48.166
The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy.

01:07:48.166 --> 01:07:53.263
I'll tell you one thing. I wanted to have the power to make you disappear.

01:07:53.638 --> 01:07:56.664
You're too boring!

01:07:57.175 --> 01:08:01.441
And Jesus was referring to you, then I ask:

01:08:02.581 --> 01:08:05.617
How many people have you killed?

01:08:05.617 --> 01:08:07.319
Objection, Your Honor.

01:08:07.319 --> 01:08:10.155
He continues assuming the Bible as evidence.

01:08:10.155 --> 01:08:13.992
We all know that is a lot of fairy tales, is it?

01:08:13.992 --> 01:08:16.962
I ask that the entire line of argument is deleted from the file.

01:08:16.962 --> 01:08:19.965
Denied. And by the way, Mr. Banks,

01:08:19.965 --> 01:08:22.701
his commentary on the Bible is wrong.

01:08:22.701 --> 01:08:26.136
Do you have any proof of his statement about "fairy tales"?

01:08:26.671 --> 01:08:29.506
- Yes, Your Honor.
- Are they deaf?

01:08:29.506 --> 01:08:31.997
Sit down, all of you!

01:08:36.081 --> 01:08:39.651
According to the Bible, I killed ten people.

01:08:39.651 --> 01:08:41.586
The family of Job, that's all.

01:08:41.586 --> 01:08:44.122
But how many people God killed in the flood?

01:08:44.122 --> 01:08:47.492
It is estimated that 100 million people were!

01:08:47.492 --> 01:08:51.095
- Why not tell the truth?
- Want the truth?

01:08:51.095 --> 01:08:54.122
You can not handle the truth!

01:08:55.901 --> 01:08:57.502
Order!

01:08:57.502 --> 01:09:00.027
I can handle the truth.

01:09:03.174 --> 01:09:06.344
You know, Jesus said:

01:09:06.344 --> 01:09:10.872
"I came that they may have life and have it abundantly."

01:09:12.817 --> 01:09:16.321
He also said: "I am the good shepherd.

01:09:16.321 --> 01:09:19.881
The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. "

01:09:21.926 --> 01:09:23.895
So I ask:

01:09:23.895 --> 01:09:28.800
Would you give your life for a human being, as Jesus did?

01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:30.700
"Of course not.

01:09:31.670 --> 01:09:33.438
Humans are garbage.

01:09:33.438 --> 01:09:35.962
I'm just the garbage collector.

01:09:37.542 --> 01:09:40.612
- Well put, Satan.
- Your Honor, I think we can not ...

01:09:40.612 --> 01:09:42.647
____Sit!

01:09:42.647 --> 01:09:46.417
Why get so nervous when I mention the name of Jesus Christ?

01:09:46.417 --> 01:09:49.421
Why do not you ask me something fun, like death?

01:09:49.421 --> 01:09:52.290
- Ask about the death, come on!
- Want to talk about death?

01:09:52.290 --> 01:09:56.027
- Let's talk about death.
- How many people think are going to hell?

01:09:56.027 --> 01:09:58.029
I do not know. You know best. Say.

01:09:58.029 --> 01:10:01.833
Over two billion people, according to the book of Revelation.

01:10:01.833 --> 01:10:05.070
- What about that?
- That man is evil,

01:10:05.070 --> 01:10:08.206
God is just, and you have part in the guilt.

01:10:08.206 --> 01:10:12.010
Oh, I know. Been in hell, boy?

01:10:12.010 --> 01:10:13.945
It's not a fun place.

01:10:13.945 --> 01:10:16.781
No. That's a shame, huh?

01:10:16.781 --> 01:10:19.011
Because that's where you go.

01:10:25.991 --> 01:10:27.151
Order!

01:10:27.459 --> 01:10:29.859
We will have a recess of 15 minutes.

01:10:39.537 --> 01:10:42.335
- That was amazing.
is

01:10:43.041 --> 01:10:44.702
Now what?

01:10:46.444 --> 01:10:49.140
- We need more witnesses.
ok

01:10:50.148 --> 01:10:51.376
She's OK.

01:10:54.853 --> 01:10:56.445
Pastor Pringle,

01:10:57.689 --> 01:10:59.486
everything is God's fault?

01:11:00.225 --> 01:11:02.827
No, not his fault.

01:11:02.827 --> 01:11:06.998
He is the creator of all things.

01:11:06.998 --> 01:11:09.434
However he gave us free will

01:11:09.434 --> 01:11:12.926
that we should be free to choose.

01:11:13.571 --> 01:11:14.873
It's just.

01:11:14.873 --> 01:11:17.034
Thank you very much!
Thank you!

01:11:20.779 --> 01:11:23.648
- Pastor Pringle, right?
ok

01:11:23.648 --> 01:11:29.177
Let me get this straight. You said that God gives us free will

01:11:30.755 --> 01:11:34.125
that every man can choose between Satan and God.

01:11:34.125 --> 01:11:37.495
ok
- So if I go now to Mr. O'Brian

01:11:37.495 --> 01:11:41.431
and throws a punch at his face, this is my free will?

01:11:43.301 --> 01:11:45.970
ok
Very good!

01:11:45.970 --> 01:11:50.875
So is not the fault of Satan if we follow this line of reasoning.

01:11:50.875 --> 01:11:55.080
Well, Satan came to kill, steal and destroy.

01:11:55.080 --> 01:12:00.018
It is clear from Scripture that he is behind all the world's problems.

01:12:00.018 --> 01:12:06.014
However, we become responsible for our actions when we fall into temptation.

01:12:07.258 --> 01:12:08.555
Thank you."

01:12:12.931 --> 01:12:14.489
Pastor Philips,

01:12:15.633 --> 01:12:20.271
can prove to me in 30 seconds or less that God exists?

01:12:20.271 --> 01:12:22.674
- Objection!
- Denied.

01:12:22.674 --> 01:12:24.476
The witness can answer.

01:12:24.476 --> 01:12:28.513
30 seconds to prove that God exists? Can I do this in a sentence.

01:12:28.513 --> 01:12:32.210
Something can not come from nothing is impossible.

01:12:32.684 --> 01:12:36.848
Very well. Something can not come from nowhere. How so?

01:12:37.622 --> 01:12:42.460
We can explain where life began, where thoughts began to explain,

01:12:42.460 --> 01:12:45.163
but can not prove the moral conscience.

01:12:45.163 --> 01:12:47.899
This is leaving scientists puzzled

01:12:47.899 --> 01:12:50.697
and also proves the existence of God.

01:12:52.537 --> 01:12:56.541
- And what is the mission of Satan?
- I think it is clear from Scripture.

01:12:56.541 --> 01:13:00.678
He came to steal, kill and destroy.

01:13:00.678 --> 01:13:03.014
- Is there a hell?
Absolutely!

01:13:03.014 --> 01:13:07.318
And every day people have the opportunity to choose heaven or hell.

01:13:07.318 --> 01:13:08.717
Thank you."

01:13:10.121 --> 01:13:13.658
Do you think that Satan is guilty of 8 trillion dollars?

01:13:13.658 --> 01:13:17.253
- Objection!
- Denied. Answer the question.

01:13:18.296 --> 01:13:20.798
You can not put a price on the damage he did,

01:13:20.798 --> 01:13:23.995
but humans are responsible for their own souls.

01:13:24.936 --> 01:13:26.563
Thank you, pastor. That's all.

01:13:28.306 --> 01:13:32.710
That's right, folks. The case is a back and forth like a game of ping-pong.

01:13:32.710 --> 01:13:35.046
Tony, who is winning?

01:13:35.046 --> 01:13:37.148
It's hard to tell, even if difficult,

01:13:37.148 --> 01:13:41.152
but it was brilliant of him to bring different people to testify.

01:13:41.152 --> 01:13:46.157
I would say that O'Brian is winning right now,

01:13:46.157 --> 01:13:48.826
and he seems able to take the case to the end.

01:13:48.826 --> 01:13:52.922
I think so. The jury is now supporting O'Brian.

01:13:55.934 --> 01:13:58.169
- I'm a little worried, sir.
"A little."

01:13:58.169 --> 01:14:02.106
Gentlemen, we are losing this cause. We need to change the methods ...

01:14:02.106 --> 01:14:04.939
Who do you think you're talking?

01:14:05.710 --> 01:14:09.747
You think as much, no? Just because you studied law at Stanford, is not it?

01:14:09.747 --> 01:14:13.451
Work in a large firm? Only you know nothing, man.

01:14:13.451 --> 01:14:15.578
And that goes for you too!

01:14:16.354 --> 01:14:18.990
Listen, you better win this case, I'm warning you,

01:14:18.990 --> 01:14:21.859
or my highest priority will pursue you day and night

01:14:21.859 --> 01:14:25.522
this world and in hell, right? Now get out of here! Get out!

01:14:29.834 --> 01:14:32.166
Never get tired of playing the bully?

01:14:33.204 --> 01:14:36.941
You know, I still do not understand you and your wife, after all ...

01:14:36.941 --> 01:14:41.746
or you are super super crazy or stupid to want to fight me.

01:14:41.746 --> 01:14:44.148
I'm not afraid of you.

01:14:44.148 --> 01:14:47.051
Yes, you can be more powerful than I on this earth,

01:14:47.051 --> 01:14:50.255
but Jesus is infinitely more powerful than you.

01:14:50.255 --> 01:14:52.590
Is quoting the Bible again, is not it?

01:14:52.590 --> 01:14:57.721
I know, I know. So why not ask God to cure cancer in the brain of Gwen?

01:15:03.167 --> 01:15:05.635
What?"
Oh,

01:15:06.504 --> 01:15:09.207
She did not tell you? Wow.

01:15:09.207 --> 01:15:13.611
What a pity. Well, she has brain cancer.

01:15:13.611 --> 01:15:16.341
She only got 5 months of life.

01:15:16.781 --> 01:15:20.051
- You're lying.
- Oh, yeah, I'm lying.

01:15:20.051 --> 01:15:23.621
I know, after all Satan ... He always lies, is not it?

01:15:23.621 --> 01:15:28.217
Well then why you did not ask her?

01:15:41.572 --> 01:15:44.676
Everyone needs compassion,

01:15:44.676 --> 01:15:48.043
a love that never fails.

01:15:51.416 --> 01:15:54.613
- Gwen, I must ask you something.
What?"

01:15:55.320 --> 01:15:57.481
And you have to be honest with me, okay?

01:16:01.926 --> 01:16:03.723
Are you ill, dear?

01:16:10.068 --> 01:16:11.695
____I need to know!

01:16:16.307 --> 01:16:18.366
You're dying of cancer?

01:16:23.815 --> 01:16:25.680
____Why do not you tell me?

01:16:27.118 --> 01:16:28.449
Sorry.

01:16:30.455 --> 01:16:33.356
You were so busy.

01:16:33.991 --> 01:16:38.519
You know what? I want to continue the trial, all right?

01:16:39.697 --> 01:16:41.799
I want you to win!

01:16:41.799 --> 01:16:44.063
Are you listening? I want you to win!

01:16:47.472 --> 01:16:48.871
____I love you!

01:16:51.909 --> 01:16:53.240
Oh, dear,

01:16:53.945 --> 01:16:55.742
I love you too much.

01:17:01.252 --> 01:17:02.913
Stand-up

01:17:06.524 --> 01:17:08.082
You may be seated.

01:17:11.295 --> 01:17:13.331
The defense has something to say?

01:17:13.331 --> 01:17:16.868
Your Honor, we ask the court to grant us a delay

01:17:16.868 --> 01:17:19.860
and suspend this trial immediately.

01:17:21.072 --> 01:17:22.266
Order!

01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:24.709
Doctor, on what basis?

01:17:24.709 --> 01:17:28.475
Your Honor, this man is not Satan.

01:17:30.915 --> 01:17:32.617
Order!

01:17:32.617 --> 01:17:35.887
Doctor, you understand what you're saying?

01:17:35.887 --> 01:17:40.158
The fact that he admitted to be Satan is unmistakable.

01:17:40.158 --> 01:17:46.731
Your Honor, according to international law, section 666,

01:17:46.731 --> 01:17:50.368
the trial can not continue if there is doubt as to the identity.

01:17:50.368 --> 01:17:53.404
Section 666? Never heard of her.

01:17:53.404 --> 01:17:56.862
It's in your book. Page 341.

01:18:00.611 --> 01:18:04.172
666. Here you are.

01:18:05.450 --> 01:18:07.885
Prosecuting attorney, any comments?

01:18:07.885 --> 01:18:11.589
Your Honor, it was established that he is Satan.

01:18:11.589 --> 01:18:14.892
No, it was established, Your Honor.

01:18:14.892 --> 01:18:17.595
Especially in the light of new revelations about our client.

01:18:17.595 --> 01:18:20.465
Oh! Let's stop.

01:18:20.465 --> 01:18:23.696
Doctors want to see everyone in my room now.

01:18:27.672 --> 01:18:29.440
This is absurd!

01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:31.075
Can I revoke your license for this!

01:18:31.075 --> 01:18:34.579
Your Honor, we were alerted to the fact that our client is who it says it.

01:18:34.579 --> 01:18:36.314
- He is not Satan!
____What are you saying?

01:18:36.314 --> 01:18:40.284
He's crazy. We represent deftly

01:18:40.284 --> 01:18:41.953
and he tricked us.

01:18:41.953 --> 01:18:44.689
Oh, he cheated, he cheated?

01:18:44.689 --> 01:18:47.959
You are not the best law firm in the world?

01:18:47.959 --> 01:18:51.262
- He also tricked them to pay?
- Your Honor, he's not crazy.

01:18:51.262 --> 01:18:52.997
I judge it, thanks.

01:18:52.997 --> 01:18:56.567
We ask that the entire case is dismissed for lack of person.

01:18:56.567 --> 01:19:00.304
- And under international law ... 393
- Will not quote the law!

01:19:00.304 --> 01:19:05.109
This case will continue, but demand appears to be proof of identity.

01:19:05.109 --> 01:19:08.079
You will have to prove that man is Satan.

01:19:08.079 --> 01:19:10.014
- Your Honor, it does not ...
- Oh, stop it,

01:19:10.014 --> 01:19:12.049
- And all come back to court.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

01:19:12.049 --> 01:19:13.983
Good luck to you.

01:19:21.592 --> 01:19:23.861
If you won or not,

01:19:23.861 --> 01:19:25.796
you defended what he believed

01:19:25.796 --> 01:19:28.799
and faced all that public humiliation.

01:19:28.799 --> 01:19:31.168
You never gave up.

01:19:31.168 --> 01:19:33.762
I respect that very much.

01:19:35.907 --> 01:19:37.575
Thanks, I ...

01:19:37.575 --> 01:19:40.635
I wish there was a way to prove this guy is the devil.

01:19:41.045 --> 01:19:42.376
It is.

01:19:45.249 --> 01:19:46.341
I asked: "Are you okay?"

01:19:46.717 --> 01:19:49.185
- I'm fine.
Mr. Wilson: Hi yes Id consider selling direct to you! TShe skirt is on its way & was posted so should reach you soon!! I will look up tShe delivery slip to see if I can see wShen it will be delivered & get back to you. Kindest Regards LOLITA J

01:19:55.159 --> 01:19:57.461
How are you?
- Okay, how about you?

01:19:57.461 --> 01:19:58.860
I'm fine.

01:19:59.830 --> 01:20:02.390
I thought I had caught that guy, you know?

01:20:02.967 --> 01:20:05.333
He is too smart.

01:20:06.170 --> 01:20:10.334
You are dealing with a power beyond his comprehension.

01:20:11.075 --> 01:20:14.238
Luke, God is still in control.

01:20:15.246 --> 01:20:17.237
Yeah, I feel that ...

01:20:18.182 --> 01:20:19.750
What did you say?

01:20:19.750 --> 01:20:23.686
God is in control, Luke. God is in control.

01:20:24.755 --> 01:20:27.692
- Remember this.
____I love you!

01:20:27.692 --> 01:20:29.182
____I love you!

01:20:30.661 --> 01:20:32.185
Is that OK?"

01:20:37.501 --> 01:20:42.165
Your Honor, the prosecution would like to bring Satan to testify.

01:20:57.188 --> 01:20:58.416
"Hi,

01:20:58.823 --> 01:21:00.085
"Hi,

01:21:01.225 --> 01:21:05.753
Why did the court and this jury that you were Satan?

01:21:07.431 --> 01:21:10.034
In fact, if I remember correctly,

01:21:10.034 --> 01:21:13.471
I never said I was Satan, who said it was you.

01:21:13.471 --> 01:21:16.307
You answered all the questions like Satan.

01:21:16.307 --> 01:21:20.437
Well, someone had to defend Io, and that someone could be me, right?

01:21:21.345 --> 01:21:22.573
Order!

01:21:23.347 --> 01:21:25.149
As you make a living?

01:21:25.149 --> 01:21:27.985
I sell used cars, and new ones as well, is.

01:21:27.985 --> 01:21:29.920
Come see me, I make a special price.

01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:31.355
Really?

01:21:31.355 --> 01:21:33.724
For all of you a special precinho.

01:21:33.724 --> 01:21:36.494
How about that, folks? But that cute.

01:21:36.494 --> 01:21:38.596
It's all just a big joke to you, is not it?

01:21:38.596 --> 01:21:42.733
Now, come on, we all had fun, right? I mean,

01:21:42.733 --> 01:21:45.136
I had my 15 minutes, you had her,

01:21:45.136 --> 01:21:48.372
all go home happy and satisfied, right?

01:21:48.372 --> 01:21:52.343
After all, why did not you sued Satan?

01:21:52.343 --> 01:21:53.640
No.

01:21:54.345 --> 01:21:57.178
You're a rational person, is not it?

01:21:58.582 --> 01:22:01.949
Yes you?

01:22:04.555 --> 01:22:07.786
You would not do anything unusual in this court, would you?

01:22:08.459 --> 01:22:11.553
There is nothing that is common in this court.

01:22:12.997 --> 01:22:14.294
Order!

01:22:14.765 --> 01:22:17.068
- Sorry, Your Honor.
- I meant ...

01:22:17.068 --> 01:22:20.604
now that you turned out to be a car salesman ...

01:22:20.604 --> 01:22:21.672
"Right, right.

01:22:21.672 --> 01:22:24.971
You would not do anything crazy, would you?

01:22:26.010 --> 01:22:28.479
- I think not.
- No, you do not do anything weird

01:22:28.479 --> 01:22:31.782
- Before this jury, would you?
- Of course not.

01:22:31.782 --> 01:22:35.920
No, after all, you now says he is not Satan.

01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:38.622
That's right. Well, now we have fun, no? Now ...

01:22:38.622 --> 01:22:41.225
- Wait just a minute more, friend.
- Hey! No. ..

01:22:41.225 --> 01:22:43.627
- What ... No, no, no.
- Are you paying attention now, right?

01:22:43.627 --> 01:22:45.696
Yes, sometimes ... You know what? Stop ...

01:22:45.696 --> 01:22:48.899
Stop shaking it in front of my face, please. I'm asking.

01:22:48.899 --> 01:22:50.668
- It'll be even better.
- Your Honor!

01:22:50.668 --> 01:22:52.903
He's shaking a Bible here in front of me.

01:22:52.903 --> 01:22:57.074
- I have something special here for you.
- I'm sure yes.

01:22:57.074 --> 01:23:00.976
- James, chapter 4, verse 7.
- Oh, no.

01:23:02.246 --> 01:23:05.382
Submit yourselves to God.

01:23:05.382 --> 01:23:09.443
Resist the devil and he will flee from you.

01:23:10.421 --> 01:23:14.619
Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you.

01:23:15.059 --> 01:23:18.195
Cleanse your hands, sinners,

01:23:18.195 --> 01:23:21.732
and purify your hearts, you who have a split mind.

01:23:21.732 --> 01:23:24.435
Have you finished? Oh, no.

01:23:24.435 --> 01:23:29.473
By the power and truth of these scriptures

01:23:29.473 --> 01:23:32.340
and in the name of Jesus Christ,

01:23:33.310 --> 01:23:35.972
get behind me, Satan!

01:23:36.580 --> 01:23:37.672
How?

01:23:38.315 --> 01:23:40.151
I said:

01:23:40.151 --> 01:23:45.487
Stay behind me, Satan! In the name of Jesus Christ!

01:23:48.893 --> 01:23:53.921
Excuse me, Satan, return to the witness stand.

01:23:56.500 --> 01:23:58.636
Sorry.
- This was unusual.

01:23:58.636 --> 01:24:01.338
I. .. I am sick, Your Honor.

01:24:01.338 --> 01:24:03.533
It makes it all the time?

01:24:04.975 --> 01:24:07.511
I bet that causes a lot of laughs, right?

01:24:07.511 --> 01:24:09.647
You could not even be Satan,

01:24:09.647 --> 01:24:13.684
after all, the Bible clearly says that if we resist the devil,

01:24:13.684 --> 01:24:15.652
he will flee.

01:24:18.289 --> 01:24:20.991
- But this does not apply to you, is not it?
- No.

01:24:20.991 --> 01:24:22.827
I. .. I usually ...

01:24:22.827 --> 01:24:27.787
Stay behind me, Satan!

01:24:31.335 --> 01:24:35.940
I have a proposition for you, friend.

01:24:35.940 --> 01:24:39.310
Come on, friend Luke, what do you think?

01:24:39.310 --> 01:24:43.647
I give you everything you could want in this life.

01:24:43.647 --> 01:24:47.651
Riches, beautiful houses, horses.

01:24:47.651 --> 01:24:50.554
And what will this cost me? My soul?

01:24:50.554 --> 01:24:53.991
Therefore, only your soul. It's nothing. His soul ...

01:24:53.991 --> 01:24:57.328
You can take your offer and throw it in the trash.

01:24:57.328 --> 01:24:58.629
Order!

01:24:58.629 --> 01:25:01.723
Go back to the witness stand, sir.

01:25:02.433 --> 01:25:05.102
This was very irrational.

01:25:05.102 --> 01:25:09.673
In fact, you look up stupid now.

01:25:09.673 --> 01:25:12.039
____How about that?

01:25:15.512 --> 01:25:18.616
Would you please go back to the bank?

01:25:18.616 --> 01:25:20.684
Will you shut up?

01:25:20.684 --> 01:25:23.687
Not done yet! Shut up! Shut up!

01:25:23.687 --> 01:25:27.591
And you, what are you looking at?

01:25:27.591 --> 01:25:29.183
Something funny?

01:25:29.493 --> 01:25:31.929
I know all about you.

01:25:31.929 --> 01:25:35.299
I know all your secrets.

01:25:35.299 --> 01:25:37.868
- Players are addicted to sex ...
- The witness ...

01:25:37.868 --> 01:25:39.803
_____Shut up!
- Lord accused ...

01:25:39.803 --> 01:25:41.438
_____Shut up!
- Go back to the bank ...

01:25:41.438 --> 01:25:43.474
____Sit!
- Where is your place.

01:25:43.474 --> 01:25:45.237
- Take your ...
- Shut up!

01:25:51.582 --> 01:25:54.318
I know all about you, all of you.

01:25:54.318 --> 01:25:56.343
I'm watching you.

01:25:59.089 --> 01:26:01.492
- I want to know tShe truth.

01:26:01.492 --> 01:26:05.724
The real truth, sincere and true?

01:26:07.631 --> 01:26:11.602
I delight ...

01:26:11.602 --> 01:26:14.571
I wreak havoc in the world.

01:26:15.072 --> 01:26:18.075
In playing the rich against the poor,

01:26:18.075 --> 01:26:19.777
race against race,

01:26:19.777 --> 01:26:23.113
country against country, man against man,

01:26:23.113 --> 01:26:25.604
but especially

01:26:26.583 --> 01:26:29.381
man against God.

01:26:30.454 --> 01:26:32.786
Yes, God.

01:26:33.590 --> 01:26:36.582
God, God. Yes, God.

01:26:39.396 --> 01:26:42.456
Do you know what God invented?

01:26:43.233 --> 01:26:47.171
Now most of you are very idiot to realize it.

01:26:47.171 --> 01:26:52.109
God created the oceans and the stars,

01:26:52.109 --> 01:26:55.312
created compassion, forgiveness e. ..

01:26:55.312 --> 01:26:58.282
stupid things like love.

01:26:58.282 --> 01:27:01.618
He created good health, raindrops,

01:27:01.618 --> 01:27:04.485
and the essence of jasmine.

01:27:05.155 --> 01:27:08.886
You know what I created? Do you know?

01:27:09.193 --> 01:27:12.496
I created the sound,

01:27:12.496 --> 01:27:15.299
and how stupid you are, you loved it!

01:27:15.299 --> 01:27:18.135
Humans love the sounds that I created.

01:27:18.135 --> 01:27:20.771
Alarm automobiles, motorcycles, whistles,

01:27:20.771 --> 01:27:23.741
nightclubs, gangster rap, techno music,

01:27:23.741 --> 01:27:26.844
invented anything that creates noise.

01:27:26.844 --> 01:27:28.545
And you know why?

01:27:28.545 --> 01:27:32.504
The noise away any thought of God.

01:27:36.086 --> 01:27:37.821
What is the problem?

01:27:37.821 --> 01:27:41.222
Do not you love the song of hell?

01:27:45.362 --> 01:27:48.532
Let me tell you a secret.

01:27:48.532 --> 01:27:52.036
I invented the customer service.

01:27:52.036 --> 01:27:55.130
Automatic answer, my idea too.

01:27:55.606 --> 01:27:58.040
Notification unfair? It came from me.

01:27:58.876 --> 01:28:02.175
A huge bill and unjust, by me.

01:28:02.513 --> 01:28:04.014
Traffic tickets?

01:28:04.014 --> 01:28:08.585
They are my utility companies, oil and car parks.

01:28:08.585 --> 01:28:12.022
Who do you think applies fines? I do this to annoy you,

01:28:12.022 --> 01:28:15.014
because I hate to the core!

01:28:23.400 --> 01:28:27.928
You humans are pathetic.

01:28:28.806 --> 01:28:31.508
I can try Ios with a chocolate bar

01:28:31.508 --> 01:28:35.035
and you deny Jesus Christ in a millisecond.

01:28:35.846 --> 01:28:37.247
After all ...

01:28:37.247 --> 01:28:41.785
people are massacred in Rwanda, and you yawn.

01:28:41.785 --> 01:28:44.221
Starving people in Haiti,

01:28:44.221 --> 01:28:47.191
and you give a money supply in the church.

01:28:47.191 --> 01:28:49.126
Failed!

01:28:49.126 --> 01:28:52.289
What a bunch of losers!

01:29:05.843 --> 01:29:07.208
War!

01:29:08.312 --> 01:29:10.948
They knew that most wars begin over land?

01:29:10.948 --> 01:29:14.084
Believe? For land dispute.

01:29:14.084 --> 01:29:17.287
And yet, 75% of the land is unoccupied,

01:29:17.287 --> 01:29:19.089
even in the U.S.!

01:29:19.089 --> 01:29:21.859
Oh yes, I know, I started the wars,

01:29:21.859 --> 01:29:25.920
but it is idiots like you need to finish what I started.

01:29:35.305 --> 01:29:40.110
I need people who care about silly political disputes.

01:29:40.110 --> 01:29:42.479
The left versus right,

01:29:42.479 --> 01:29:46.506
is all a distraction, do you not see?

01:29:48.852 --> 01:29:50.979
You know, you ...

01:29:51.989 --> 01:29:55.592
you believe in God as much as I believe in fairy tales.

01:29:55.592 --> 01:29:57.461
By the way,

01:29:57.461 --> 01:29:59.496
I love the way depicted in the media.

01:29:59.496 --> 01:30:02.232
That doll with a pitchfork,

01:30:02.232 --> 01:30:05.099
horns and tail.

01:30:08.939 --> 01:30:13.535
You humans are so stupid.

01:30:14.745 --> 01:30:18.511
They are like a bunch of rats running on a wheel.

01:30:19.116 --> 01:30:23.348
You see, every day people die,

01:30:24.154 --> 01:30:25.789
and want to know?

01:30:25.789 --> 01:30:29.393
They can be in two places, and are not really dead.

01:30:29.393 --> 01:30:33.664
Are alive in heaven or in hell are alive.

01:30:33.664 --> 01:30:34.961
You choose.

01:30:44.174 --> 01:30:47.544
You know what my biggest goal?

01:30:47.544 --> 01:30:52.277
It's me take you all to hell!

01:30:52.983 --> 01:30:56.783
It is the world coming to an end, right? It better be fast.

01:30:57.754 --> 01:31:02.282
I guess they wonder why I do what I do.

01:31:04.027 --> 01:31:05.824
This is very easy.

01:31:07.130 --> 01:31:12.402
It's because I hate to the core!

01:31:12.402 --> 01:31:18.272
I hate every one of you!

01:31:32.456 --> 01:31:33.821
Have a nice day.

01:31:34.424 --> 01:31:37.621
THE TRIAL OF THE CENTURY

01:31:44.568 --> 01:31:46.136
Your Honor,

01:31:46.136 --> 01:31:50.340
ask the court to disregard any statement of our client.

01:31:50.340 --> 01:31:53.377
He did so under duress of prosecution complete

01:31:53.377 --> 01:31:56.913
and the civil procedure code 598.91,

01:31:56.913 --> 01:31:59.616
it can not be judged by this court.

01:31:59.616 --> 01:32:01.952
The problem, Your Honor, is ...

01:32:01.952 --> 01:32:06.355
the mental state of our client, it's crazy.

01:32:10.193 --> 01:32:13.797
As I do not want to appeal this case,

01:32:13.797 --> 01:32:16.867
the testimony will be removed from the file.

01:32:16.867 --> 01:32:18.435
Your Honor, I ...

01:32:18.435 --> 01:32:21.638
I want you all to follow my instruction:

01:32:21.638 --> 01:32:24.007
Do not take into account

01:32:24.007 --> 01:32:27.744
nothing that the accused uttered.

01:32:27.744 --> 01:32:30.781
Is based only on what they heard, saw,

01:32:30.781 --> 01:32:35.686
and witnessed the events and statements from witnesses.

01:32:35.686 --> 01:32:37.347
I clear?

01:32:40.624 --> 01:32:43.718
Defence lawyer closure.

01:32:48.432 --> 01:32:50.866
Distinguished members of the jury,

01:32:51.535 --> 01:32:53.637
let's think for a moment ...

01:32:53.637 --> 01:32:58.700
what kind of man sue someone in 8 trillion.

01:33:00.644 --> 01:33:04.147
Individual and selfish,

01:33:04.147 --> 01:33:08.852
wanting to attract attention, and that can not free himself from his past.

01:33:08.852 --> 01:33:12.422
And even if my client seems to be charismatic,

01:33:12.422 --> 01:33:16.620
even if he wants to make a scene in court, he is mentally ill.

01:33:17.794 --> 01:33:19.625
He is insane,

01:33:20.497 --> 01:33:22.332
he needs help,

01:33:22.332 --> 01:33:23.959
of piety,

01:33:25.102 --> 01:33:26.729
not a process.

01:33:28.305 --> 01:33:31.975
And it should not be associated with all the evil,

01:33:31.975 --> 01:33:33.643
or to be Satan himself,

01:33:33.643 --> 01:33:37.602
and this is not the apple that Eve bit the fruit

01:33:38.014 --> 01:33:39.641
in the Garden of Eden.

01:33:40.717 --> 01:33:42.919
So I ask you

01:33:42.919 --> 01:33:44.978
they conclude today

01:33:45.722 --> 01:33:49.818
as well as any logical person would do and sober,

01:33:50.594 --> 01:33:52.755
that my client ...

01:33:55.432 --> 01:33:57.200
is innocent.

01:33:57.200 --> 01:34:00.658
Now Mr. O'Brian, closure.

01:34:02.472 --> 01:34:04.099
Mr. O'Brien?

01:34:15.786 --> 01:34:19.456
Satan brought up my past.

01:34:19.456 --> 01:34:20.980
He's right.

01:34:21.792 --> 01:34:24.124
I did horrible things.

01:34:25.262 --> 01:34:28.095
I said horrible things and cruel.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:34.494
And I ask forgiveness from those who hurt.

01:34:36.072 --> 01:34:37.664
Every day ...

01:34:38.942 --> 01:34:41.069
there is a battle within me.

01:34:41.845 --> 01:34:44.681
I know what I should do.

01:34:44.681 --> 01:34:46.808
And sometimes do not.

01:34:48.018 --> 01:34:50.520
I know I should not do.

01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:52.988
Sometimes I do it anyway.

01:34:53.590 --> 01:34:59.085
But this is the struggle to choose between good and evil.

01:34:59.863 --> 01:35:03.492
Between God and Satan.

01:35:05.235 --> 01:35:07.760
Each day is a struggle

01:35:08.839 --> 01:35:11.706
to live a life that honors Jesus Christ.

01:35:13.076 --> 01:35:16.341
But when we surrender our lives to Jesus

01:35:17.113 --> 01:35:20.241
we are new people.

01:35:23.720 --> 01:35:28.089
Satan's mission is to destroy God's work.

01:35:30.026 --> 01:35:33.985
We humans are God's work.

01:35:36.099 --> 01:35:39.728
We make mistakes and He forgives us.

01:35:42.272 --> 01:35:46.504
Do not let Satan steal them from us.

01:35:47.477 --> 01:35:49.536
Make him pay ...

01:35:50.780 --> 01:35:53.715
for his attempts to destroy our lives.

01:35:54.451 --> 01:35:56.919
Let him be punished for their hatred.

01:35:57.420 --> 01:36:01.413
And thank God for his love

01:36:02.592 --> 01:36:04.583
and forgiveness.

01:36:07.364 --> 01:36:11.334
You see, the greatest trick the devil ever done

01:36:11.334 --> 01:36:14.667
was convincing the world he did not exist.

01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:20.271
But this illusion is over.

01:36:22.145 --> 01:36:23.112
Thank you."

01:36:25.181 --> 01:36:27.172
Stand-up

01:36:51.474 --> 01:36:53.710
They reached a verdict?

01:36:53.710 --> 01:36:54.911
Yes, Your Honor.

01:36:54.911 --> 01:36:57.681
The jury is favorable to the prosecution

01:36:57.681 --> 01:37:00.149
at 8 trillion dollars.

01:37:20.470 --> 01:37:21.732
Order!

01:37:22.105 --> 01:37:23.504
Order!

01:37:23.740 --> 01:37:26.766
And Satan, you can go straight to hell!

01:37:44.527 --> 01:37:46.296
Tasheila Jones, the news channel 2,

01:37:46.296 --> 01:37:49.026
We are out here and the verdict was announced!

01:37:49.699 --> 01:37:51.468
What do you think the verdict?

01:37:51.468 --> 01:37:52.636
It was a fantastic result!

01:37:52.636 --> 01:37:54.968
Luke fought for what he wanted and won. He did it!

01:38:09.019 --> 01:38:10.987
What you want, your insignificant?

01:38:10.987 --> 01:38:12.489
Can I have your autograph?

01:38:12.489 --> 01:38:15.287
Are you kidding me? Get out!

01:38:17.827 --> 01:38:19.488
Order!

01:38:20.196 --> 01:38:21.220
Order!

01:38:28.171 --> 01:38:31.038
TALK WITH DR. The GOD OF JAMES INJUSTlÃ‡A

01:38:35.645 --> 01:38:38.782
Oh, you woke up? It was a long night.

01:38:38.782 --> 01:38:41.751
What?"
- How to get here, sir?

01:38:42.886 --> 01:38:45.155
I do not know. I think I slept the whole night here.

01:38:45.155 --> 01:38:47.957
Well, I do not want to wake Io, but ...

01:38:47.957 --> 01:38:51.085
you were saying, "Get behind me, Satan!"

01:38:51.795 --> 01:38:53.126
Stay ...

01:38:53.663 --> 01:38:55.799
Oh, I must be dreaming!

01:38:55.799 --> 01:38:58.996
Well, do not study too much.

01:39:10.113 --> 01:39:14.184
Girls, girls. It's a new day.

01:39:14.184 --> 01:39:16.311
It's a new day!

01:39:24.594 --> 01:39:26.084
Gwen?

01:39:27.430 --> 01:39:29.632
- Gwen?
- Luke?

01:39:29.632 --> 01:39:32.102
- Where were you?
- Honey, are you sick?

01:39:32.102 --> 01:39:35.805
No, I'm sick. Where were you? Not called me last night.

01:39:35.805 --> 01:39:38.208
Sorry, dear, sorry. I went to the library

01:39:38.208 --> 01:39:39.542
- And fell asleep.
- In the library?

01:39:39.542 --> 01:39:42.779
I fell asleep and dreamed that you were ill e. ..

01:39:42.779 --> 01:39:44.514
and you did not tell me the dream.

01:39:44.514 --> 01:39:47.784
- You have cancer, e. ..
- Cancer?

01:39:47.784 --> 01:39:51.454
- Are you sick? You are telling the truth?
- I'm fine, but ...

01:39:51.454 --> 01:39:55.325
I thought you would kill the man who killed his mother.

01:39:55.325 --> 01:39:58.995
Honey, no. No, no, you have to hear me. I had ...

01:39:58.995 --> 01:40:01.998
a dream about the devil and I beat him,

01:40:01.998 --> 01:40:04.701
I sued in court and won.

01:40:04.701 --> 01:40:08.304
- E. .. What, him?
- I saw the gun in his car, Luke.

01:40:08.304 --> 01:40:10.907
I saw the gun in your car!

01:40:10.907 --> 01:40:13.943
I thought you were killing the man who killed his mother.

01:40:13.943 --> 01:40:16.679
No, no, dear. This has already happened.

01:40:16.679 --> 01:40:18.748
You can't.
- It's gone. I must be honest with you.

01:40:18.748 --> 01:40:20.416
I would do it, but ...

01:40:20.416 --> 01:40:22.185
Honey, I'm sorry.

01:40:22.185 --> 01:40:23.753
- You scared me.
- I'm so sorry.

01:40:23.753 --> 01:40:25.655
I found peace, dear.

01:40:25.655 --> 01:40:28.558
I found my peace, I found God. I found my God!
