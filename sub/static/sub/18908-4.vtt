WEBVTT

00:06.707 --> 00:09.077
- Previously on "Colony"...

00:09.943 --> 00:10.478
- Just need to find
a way out of here.

00:10.511 --> 00:11.512
- We could use a coyote.

00:13.481 --> 00:14.748
- Let's go!

00:18.286 --> 00:21.589
- The art of deception
is a natural talent,

00:21.622 --> 00:24.192
and your wife has it
in spades.

00:24.225 --> 00:26.727
- How long you been spying
on me, selling me out?

00:26.760 --> 00:28.496
- I did it to protect you.

00:28.529 --> 00:30.131
- Bullshit.
You did it for you.

00:30.164 --> 00:31.765
- The tunnel
under an old DWP substation

00:31.799 --> 00:33.201
that leads
right into downtown.

00:33.234 --> 00:34.768
- We can exploit this,

00:34.802 --> 00:36.237
set a trap for whoever's
using the tunnel.

00:36.270 --> 00:37.771
- Hands up! On your knees!

00:37.805 --> 00:39.340
- Get down!

00:39.373 --> 00:41.742
- A VIP was attacked
and abducted.

00:41.775 --> 00:44.212
- So bring me something
actionable on Broussard.

00:44.245 --> 00:46.280
- I told you--
I cannot get him for you.

00:46.314 --> 00:47.548
I wasn't lying.

00:47.581 --> 00:49.150
You wanted a body.
You got me.

00:50.518 --> 00:53.221
[thud]

00:53.254 --> 00:54.422
Charlie.

01:34.262 --> 01:37.265
[tense music]

01:37.298 --> 01:44.305
*

01:52.313 --> 01:53.814
- [speaking German]

01:57.551 --> 02:00.454
[indistinct chatter]

02:06.460 --> 02:07.695
- Good morning.

02:07.728 --> 02:09.430
I would like to begin by saying

02:09.463 --> 02:11.499
that I am honored
by my appointment

02:11.532 --> 02:15.169
to the seat
of Governor General.

02:15.203 --> 02:16.704
I know
that the Global Authority

02:16.737 --> 02:18.572
has placed a great deal
of trust in me,

02:18.606 --> 02:22.610
and I want to assure you that
I have hit the ground running.

02:22.643 --> 02:25.579
My first decision
has to been to replace

02:25.613 --> 02:28.316
the Los Angeles bloc's proxy.

02:28.349 --> 02:31.319
- [speaking French]

02:36.624 --> 02:39.627
[man speaking native language]

02:42.830 --> 02:46.534
- I promise you that these
are only our first steps.

02:46.567 --> 02:49.470
We are already pursuing
advanced security measures

02:49.503 --> 02:51.405
to remain ahead
of the insurgency.

02:51.439 --> 02:53.641
- What concrete steps
are you taking

02:53.674 --> 02:55.809
to secure the stolen artifact?

02:55.843 --> 02:59.480
- We have begun implementing
the same surveillance protocol

02:59.513 --> 03:00.881
used by the Seattle Colony

03:00.914 --> 03:02.683
to put down its insurgency

03:02.716 --> 03:05.619
and recover our Hosts'
stolen vehicle.

03:05.653 --> 03:08.889
[woman speaking French]

03:08.922 --> 03:12.926
- Our goal is to achieve
total information awareness.

03:14.395 --> 03:16.897
Many of the colonies

03:16.930 --> 03:19.433
face a certain level of unrest.

03:19.467 --> 03:21.635
Los Angeles
will become a test case

03:21.669 --> 03:26.240
for a new way forward,
a better way.

03:27.675 --> 03:30.844
- [speaking native language].

03:30.878 --> 03:33.947
- [speaking Spanish]

03:36.950 --> 03:39.687
[woman speaking French]

03:42.523 --> 03:45.393
- A vote has been called.

03:45.426 --> 03:46.560
All in favor?

03:48.362 --> 03:51.799
[together]
Aye. SÃ­.

03:51.832 --> 03:53.401
Those against?

03:53.434 --> 03:55.536
[together]
No.

04:05.946 --> 04:10.684
We have decided
against recommending Los Angeles

04:10.718 --> 04:14.455
for total rendition
at this time.

04:14.488 --> 04:19.427
We will reevaluate your colony's
status at our next summit.

04:19.460 --> 04:21.562
Units from our
Intelligence Directorate

04:21.595 --> 04:23.297
are already on the ground

04:23.331 --> 04:24.998
in the Los Angeles bloc.

04:25.032 --> 04:29.570
We expect they will be given
complete latitude.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.905
- You have my word.

04:31.939 --> 04:34.442
Thank you again for seeing me.

04:34.475 --> 04:40.481
*

04:41.749 --> 04:44.752
[dramatic music]

04:44.785 --> 04:50.758
*

04:56.664 --> 04:57.998
- Come in.

04:58.031 --> 05:01.669
Come in, come in.

05:01.702 --> 05:04.472
[door closes]

05:04.505 --> 05:06.440
I just...

05:06.474 --> 05:08.742
I missed you so much.

05:08.776 --> 05:10.744
You, uh--are you hungry?

05:10.778 --> 05:13.414
You got to be hungry, right?

05:17.718 --> 05:21.622
Or how about we, um--how about
we get you cleaned up first?

05:21.655 --> 05:22.856
- Can I show Charlie his room?

05:22.890 --> 05:24.758
- Yes, yes, yes, yes,
great idea.

05:24.792 --> 05:27.728
Um, you do that, and I'll--
I'll get a shower running, okay?

05:48.015 --> 05:49.917
- This is it--your room.

05:53.954 --> 05:56.457
Mom and Dad had to move
some of your stuff,

05:56.490 --> 05:58.759
but we had to leave
lots of things behind.

05:58.792 --> 06:01.795
We also had to change
our last name for a while

06:01.829 --> 06:03.864
and pretended we were
a different family--

06:03.897 --> 06:05.599
the Sullivans.

06:05.633 --> 06:07.535
I don't know why.

06:07.568 --> 06:10.404
- It's because they would've
killed dad for being in the FBI.

06:26.987 --> 06:28.589
- Where's Bram?

06:32.826 --> 06:36.430
- Bram was arrested trying
to leave the colony.

06:36.464 --> 06:37.665
- What?

06:37.698 --> 06:39.933
- He snuck out the day that--

06:39.967 --> 06:41.602
the day you left.

06:46.674 --> 06:48.542
I asked Maddie--
her new boyfriend's

06:48.576 --> 06:49.943
got some big position
in the Authority.

06:49.977 --> 06:51.178
I asked them for help,
and they managed

06:51.211 --> 06:53.814
to get him transferred
to a labor camp

06:53.847 --> 06:55.716
outside the walls.

06:55.749 --> 06:58.652
As long as Bram doesn't get
into any more trouble,

06:58.686 --> 07:02.556
eventually he'll be
brought back.

07:02.590 --> 07:04.592
- And this is Mom
and Dad's room.

07:04.625 --> 07:06.927
And here's the bathroom.

07:06.960 --> 07:09.530
I'm giving Charlie
a tour of the house.

07:09.563 --> 07:11.632
- Maybe we should give the kid
some privacy, yeah?

07:19.773 --> 07:21.609
- How about, um--

07:21.642 --> 07:24.211
how about you let Mom and Dad
talk for a little bit, okay?

07:24.244 --> 07:26.480
- Okay.
- Thank you so much.

07:38.191 --> 07:40.494
Charlie has blood on him.

07:40.528 --> 07:42.563
- It's not his.

07:47.067 --> 07:49.603
- What happened over there?

07:49.637 --> 07:53.006
- It was bad.

07:53.040 --> 07:55.843
- How bad?

07:55.876 --> 07:57.778
- Bad bad.

07:57.811 --> 08:01.582
I found Devon.
She helped me get to Charlie.

08:01.615 --> 08:03.050
I lost my transit pass,

08:03.083 --> 08:05.586
so I couldn't come
back here legally.

08:08.255 --> 08:10.190
We went to a coyote

08:10.223 --> 08:13.594
who had a plan
to go over the wall.

08:13.627 --> 08:14.762
- Over?

08:17.064 --> 08:18.666
- It would have worked.

08:18.699 --> 08:21.669
We were spotted
by a drone--

08:21.702 --> 08:23.871
killed everyone
but me and Charlie.

08:26.339 --> 08:28.542
Devon just, uh...

08:31.812 --> 08:34.281
I don't know why it
didn't kill us, too.

08:34.314 --> 08:37.685
Maybe it scanned my face,

08:37.718 --> 08:39.052
knew I worked
for the Occupation.

08:39.086 --> 08:40.220
I don't know.

08:40.253 --> 08:43.891
- Charlie saw all of it?

08:43.924 --> 08:45.559
- I don't think that's
the worst thing

08:45.593 --> 08:47.527
he's seen in the last year.

08:48.996 --> 08:52.566
It's anarchy over there.

08:52.600 --> 08:55.235
The Occupation
basically handed over control

08:55.268 --> 08:58.672
of the flats
to gang lords.

08:58.706 --> 09:01.942
Charlie was run
by one of them--

09:01.975 --> 09:03.711
a total sociopath.

09:03.744 --> 09:06.747
- [breathes shakily]

09:13.353 --> 09:15.055
How'd you get him out?

09:18.325 --> 09:20.828
Is he gonna be all right?

09:20.861 --> 09:23.731
- He's a tough kid,
and he's young.

09:23.764 --> 09:27.234
- [breathes shakily,
sniffles]

09:27.267 --> 09:29.770
- We can bring him back.

09:32.305 --> 09:33.741
- Sure.

09:37.244 --> 09:39.212
[knock at door]

09:39.246 --> 09:40.280
- Yep?

09:40.313 --> 09:42.616
[computer beeps, door opens]

09:42.650 --> 09:45.285
[indistinct chatter]

09:45.318 --> 09:47.154
- Boss wants to see you.

09:47.187 --> 09:49.690
- Thanks.

09:55.162 --> 09:57.898
[knock at door]

09:57.931 --> 10:00.167
- You said yesterday
you had something for me.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.301
What happened?

10:01.334 --> 10:03.637
- My source went quiet,

10:03.671 --> 10:05.906
uh, but I'll keep trying
to work him.

10:08.876 --> 10:11.912
- This bloc is under pressure
to produce results,

10:11.945 --> 10:15.148
and I don't have
the luxury of patience.

10:15.182 --> 10:17.117
I need the identity
of your source.

10:17.150 --> 10:20.187
- Uh, any contact
other than me will spook him.

10:24.157 --> 10:25.893
- It's become obvious to me

10:25.926 --> 10:29.897
that something illicit
was happening in your unit.

10:29.930 --> 10:32.733
Maybe there was a leak,
maybe something worse.

10:32.766 --> 10:35.002
I had assumed that you were
too naive to be involved,

10:35.035 --> 10:38.806
but your recent behavior
has made me wonder.

10:38.839 --> 10:40.040
I don't have the time to deal

10:40.073 --> 10:41.809
with this investigation
personally,

10:41.842 --> 10:44.077
so I'm assigning an officer
I trust to dig deeper.

10:44.111 --> 10:47.080
I expect that you will cooperate
fully with his investigation.

10:47.114 --> 10:49.316
Do you understand?

10:49.349 --> 10:51.819
- Yes.

10:51.852 --> 10:54.287
- It's possible
that you aren't lying,

10:54.321 --> 10:56.824
or maybe you got caught up in
something above your pay grade

10:56.857 --> 10:58.826
and are trying to protect
a colleague.

10:58.859 --> 11:02.062
I understand the code.

11:02.095 --> 11:04.231
I'm giving you
the chance to prove

11:04.264 --> 11:06.967
that you're a member
of my team.

11:18.846 --> 11:19.012
.

11:19.046 --> 11:21.982
[dog barking in the distance]

11:37.330 --> 11:38.766
- You grew up.

11:48.909 --> 11:51.945
How about we raid
Bram's closet?

11:51.979 --> 11:53.947
- Where is he?

11:53.981 --> 11:57.384
- Bram got into trouble.
- Is he at the Factory?

11:57.417 --> 12:02.022
- No, they sent him
to work at a--

12:02.055 --> 12:05.125
outside the colony,
but he's gonna come home.

12:05.158 --> 12:07.861
- He's at a labor camp.

12:07.895 --> 12:09.930
- You know about
the labor camps?

12:09.963 --> 12:12.399
- Sure.
- What have you heard?

12:15.035 --> 12:16.870
- Bram's gonna have to change.

12:26.479 --> 12:29.549
- Remember the day
we took this...

12:29.582 --> 12:31.919
when you'd just ridden
the big coaster at Six Flags,

12:31.952 --> 12:35.322
and you were
so proud of yourself?

12:35.355 --> 12:37.791
- I'm hungry.

12:37.825 --> 12:39.993
- Okay. Let's eat.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.866
- That's Bram's seat.

12:45.899 --> 12:48.001
- It's okay.
Sit wherever you want.

12:50.503 --> 12:52.172
- Hudson and Aunt Maddie

12:52.205 --> 12:53.240
moved into a new house.

12:53.273 --> 12:56.109
They have a pool
and everything.

12:59.212 --> 13:02.049
[dramatic music]

13:02.082 --> 13:07.454
*

13:07.487 --> 13:08.856
- Gracie.

13:16.096 --> 13:19.099
[machine beeping]

13:19.132 --> 13:22.302
[indistinct chatter]

13:32.312 --> 13:33.847
- Hey.
[chuckles]

13:33.881 --> 13:35.315
How are you?

13:35.348 --> 13:37.084
- [chuckles]

13:37.117 --> 13:38.351
Oh, pretty good.

13:38.385 --> 13:42.355
I swapped DVDs
with my neighbor last night,

13:42.389 --> 13:45.859
got the whole "Friends"
DVD box set.

13:45.893 --> 13:47.294
- Mm.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.963
- What's new?

13:49.997 --> 13:53.633
- Oh, um...

13:53.666 --> 13:56.269
[whispering]
I'm under investigation.

13:56.303 --> 13:58.939
- Wh--what? Why?

13:58.972 --> 14:03.310
- Someone from my department
was breaking the rules,

14:03.343 --> 14:07.547
and they think I might be
helping him cover it up.

14:07.580 --> 14:11.985
- Are you gonna turn him in?
- I don't know.

14:12.019 --> 14:15.022
If I do, I can save my job,

14:15.055 --> 14:17.524
maybe even get a promotion.

14:19.692 --> 14:24.331
- Yeah, well, you have
to look out for yourself.

14:24.364 --> 14:25.532
- Yeah.

14:30.170 --> 14:33.173
[tense music]

14:33.206 --> 14:40.213
*

14:44.617 --> 14:46.286
- Oh, hi.

14:46.319 --> 14:48.221
You must be Jennifer McMahon.

14:48.255 --> 14:50.057
I'm Detective Burke.

14:50.090 --> 14:53.093
I've been asked to look
through your files.

14:53.126 --> 14:56.096
- I welcome the review,
order and duty.

14:56.129 --> 14:58.932
- Oh, good. I'm glad
you're not taking it personally.

14:58.966 --> 15:00.467
Security comes
from watchfulness,

15:00.500 --> 15:02.535
and a secure bloc
is a strong bloc.

15:02.569 --> 15:04.437
So help me get up to speed.

15:04.471 --> 15:05.973
Who's your source?

15:12.345 --> 15:15.148
- I never had a source.

15:15.182 --> 15:17.117
The majority
of the terrorist cell

15:17.150 --> 15:20.353
that attacked our Hosts
came from a startup company.

15:20.387 --> 15:22.289
- Apis.
- Right.

15:22.322 --> 15:25.358
They made tiny drones
before the Arrival.

15:25.392 --> 15:27.594
I figured they must
have bugged our office

15:27.627 --> 15:29.529
to get the intel
for their attack.

15:29.562 --> 15:31.731
- Why did you lie?

15:31.764 --> 15:34.167
- Because I was trying
to keep my job.

15:34.201 --> 15:35.602
I'm good at it.

15:35.635 --> 15:37.604
- Hmm.

15:37.637 --> 15:39.639
You know, I noticed
from your daily logs

15:39.672 --> 15:42.542
that you've been focusing
on one location in particular.

15:42.575 --> 15:45.312
- Right, uh, that's because
Will Bowman

15:45.345 --> 15:46.679
got home this morning.

15:46.713 --> 15:50.750
- The agent who located
our missing Host?

15:50.783 --> 15:54.221
Why would we be
watching his house?

15:54.254 --> 15:57.624
- Because Beau, one of the other
members of our team,

15:57.657 --> 15:59.559
disappeared.

15:59.592 --> 16:01.361
It's just protocol.

16:01.394 --> 16:03.563
- Protocol?
- Mm-hmm.

16:08.301 --> 16:10.670
- You know, I have a background
in internal affairs,

16:10.703 --> 16:13.706
and it's led me
to trust my instincts,

16:13.740 --> 16:17.177
and something here--
it doesn't smell right.

16:17.210 --> 16:20.747
So I'm going to dig...

16:20.780 --> 16:25.052
and if I find something,
you're going to the Factory.

16:25.085 --> 16:26.686
- Wh--

16:26.719 --> 16:29.122
- Because concealing a crime

16:29.156 --> 16:31.191
is as bad as participating.

16:33.093 --> 16:35.595
Think about that
before we talk again.

16:47.107 --> 16:47.307
.

16:47.340 --> 16:50.477
- What's he doing?

16:51.010 --> 16:52.545
- Stockpiling food.

16:53.780 --> 16:57.084
- We got to get him
to open up, Will.

16:57.117 --> 16:59.152
He'll talk to you.

16:59.186 --> 17:02.055
- I tried.

17:06.326 --> 17:08.228
I'll try again.

17:12.165 --> 17:13.166
Still hungry?

17:15.402 --> 17:19.372
- Did you pick this house
because of the oranges?

17:19.406 --> 17:21.074
- That was one of the reasons.

17:21.108 --> 17:22.309
- How'd you get this house?

17:22.342 --> 17:23.610
- People who lived here
were on vacation

17:23.643 --> 17:26.613
when the Arrival happened.

17:26.646 --> 17:27.847
We're safe here.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.382
- No, we're not.

17:32.385 --> 17:35.522
- Come on, sit with me.
I want to tell you a story.

17:42.429 --> 17:45.465
[sighs]

17:45.498 --> 17:49.502
My last tour with the Army,
I was on a convoy

17:49.536 --> 17:53.106
that got attacked
outside of Mosul.

17:53.140 --> 17:55.642
The Humvee right in front of me
got hit by an IED.

17:59.379 --> 18:00.880
Our Humvees had a weak spot,

18:00.913 --> 18:03.816
and the IED must have hit it
just right.

18:08.855 --> 18:11.658
First thing I saw was
one of my best friends.

18:14.694 --> 18:17.230
When I got home,

18:17.264 --> 18:20.133
I never said anything
about it to anyone,

18:20.167 --> 18:23.670
not even your mom.

18:23.703 --> 18:25.905
I just carried it
around inside me,

18:25.938 --> 18:28.408
and I can still feel it
sitting there.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.412
That's why we need to talk

18:32.445 --> 18:34.714
about what happened to you
in Santa Monica,

18:34.747 --> 18:37.150
'cause I don't want you
to carry it around like I did.

18:37.184 --> 18:40.853
- I'm not carrying
around anything.

18:40.887 --> 18:42.855
- What about Devon?

18:42.889 --> 18:45.658
She saved my life,
maybe yours.

18:45.692 --> 18:48.828
It's okay
to be sad about her.

18:48.861 --> 18:51.331
I am.

18:51.364 --> 18:52.599
- People die.

18:52.632 --> 18:55.602
[solemn music]

18:57.870 --> 19:00.573
Want an orange?

19:00.607 --> 19:01.941
[footsteps approaching]

19:01.974 --> 19:04.711
- It's okay.
I'm good.

19:04.744 --> 19:10.317
*

19:10.350 --> 19:13.853
- I got oranges.
- Great.

19:13.886 --> 19:20.860
*

19:25.398 --> 19:28.435
- He blew me off.

19:28.468 --> 19:30.503
- Like you said, he's home.

19:30.537 --> 19:32.205
That's the first step.

19:32.239 --> 19:33.573
- What about Bram?

19:33.606 --> 19:37.777
- Bram will come home, too.
- And then what?

19:37.810 --> 19:39.779
You think it's an accident
he got involved?

19:39.812 --> 19:42.515
- Don't put it all on me.
You didn't see it either.

19:42.549 --> 19:44.917
- I didn't see
a lot of things...

19:44.951 --> 19:47.254
because I loved you.

19:51.858 --> 19:55.395
- I love you.

19:55.428 --> 19:58.765
Will, lying to you was
the biggest mistake of my life.

19:58.798 --> 20:00.500
It haunts me.

20:00.533 --> 20:02.869
- Did it haunt you
while you were doing it

20:02.902 --> 20:05.405
or just now that
you've been caught?

20:07.640 --> 20:11.644
- I was trying to do something--

20:11.678 --> 20:15.248
something bigger than me,
than us.

20:15.282 --> 20:17.517
The cell started to fall apart,
and--and I asked--

20:17.550 --> 20:19.352
- I know.

20:19.386 --> 20:22.021
Quayle came to me and was ready
to give up the whole damn cell

20:22.054 --> 20:24.524
to save his own ass--
Broussard, you.

20:24.557 --> 20:25.892
He didn't even blink.

20:29.496 --> 20:31.230
So I killed him.

20:32.799 --> 20:35.668
- [gasps]

20:35.702 --> 20:39.406
- He was unarmed,
and I executed him...

20:39.439 --> 20:42.709
for you.

20:42.742 --> 20:44.811
That's what haunts me.

20:46.713 --> 20:48.315
- [scoffs]

20:48.348 --> 20:49.549
- You know,
I did a lot of things

20:49.582 --> 20:51.818
to try and keep
this family together,

20:51.851 --> 20:53.686
and the whole time you're
doing things to tear us apart.

20:53.720 --> 20:55.955
- That's not fair.

20:55.988 --> 20:57.857
Will, this all started
when you decided

20:57.890 --> 20:59.692
to smuggle yourself through
the wall to get Charlie

20:59.726 --> 21:01.561
without ever saying
a word to me.

21:01.594 --> 21:04.564
You and I trust our instincts.

21:04.597 --> 21:06.566
That is who we are.
It's who we've always been.

21:06.599 --> 21:09.836
- Well, it's not working!
- You think I don't know that?

21:18.110 --> 21:20.847
- Tell me what happened
to Bram.

21:23.983 --> 21:25.985
- He joined a resistance cell

21:26.018 --> 21:28.455
through a-a teacher
at his school,

21:28.488 --> 21:31.991
and they were caught
going under the wall.

21:32.024 --> 21:35.595
- Under? Where?

21:35.628 --> 21:39.866
- He said something
about an old DWP tunnel.

21:39.899 --> 21:40.867
What?

21:40.900 --> 21:42.301
- God.

22:19.872 --> 22:24.677
- Mr. Bowman!
Oh, welcome home.

22:24.711 --> 22:28.047
- Thanks.
- What a blessing.

22:28.080 --> 22:29.482
I'm sure everyone's so--

22:29.516 --> 22:31.484
- Charlie's home.
- Oh, excellent.

22:31.518 --> 22:34.387
- Come on.
- I'm so excited.

22:34.421 --> 22:36.556
- He's upstairs.
He didn't fit into...

22:36.589 --> 22:37.824
- Gracie.
- His clothes...

22:37.857 --> 22:39.826
but Mom gave him some
of Bram's.

22:43.095 --> 22:45.965
Charlie?
Charlie?

22:53.105 --> 22:55.908
Are you playing
hide-and-seek?

22:55.942 --> 22:57.944
Lindsey's here.

22:57.977 --> 23:01.380
- Hello.
You must be Charlie.

23:03.082 --> 23:04.551
- Who are you?

23:04.584 --> 23:07.987
- I'm Gracie's tutor.

23:08.020 --> 23:11.190
We were praying every day
that our benevolent Hosts

23:11.223 --> 23:13.960
would bring you home,
and they did.

23:13.993 --> 23:15.194
- My dad brought me home.

23:15.227 --> 23:18.598
- With their help
and guidance.

23:18.631 --> 23:20.533
- No.

23:20.567 --> 23:22.935
Come on, Gracie.

23:35.582 --> 23:37.116
- What now?

23:37.149 --> 23:40.620
- We stay together.
That's how we survive.

23:43.890 --> 23:46.759
- What about us?

23:50.096 --> 23:52.599
- I don't know.

24:16.388 --> 24:17.456

24:24.263 --> 24:25.998
- You know,
I kind of like it long.

24:26.032 --> 24:29.636
It reminds me of Dad's.

24:29.669 --> 24:33.139

- Yeah.

25:28.861 --> 25:31.564
You know, I missed you...

25:31.598 --> 25:33.566
so much.

25:37.904 --> 25:40.573
- Why is Lindsey here?

25:40.607 --> 25:43.610
- Uh, the government
assigned her to us.

25:46.245 --> 25:50.082
You don't like her?
- [sighs] No.

25:50.116 --> 25:51.618
- Me neither.

25:54.386 --> 25:56.322
- You should get rid of her.

26:00.927 --> 26:04.330
- Well, that's not
that simple, Charlie.

26:11.070 --> 26:12.672
Yeah.

you something.

You're getting
the backstage tour.

26:50.242 --> 26:53.379
- Come on.

I understand you have
a background in data processing.

27:09.796 --> 27:12.865
- That's right.
- Who did you work for?

27:12.899 --> 27:15.267
- Uh, singlemingle.com.

27:15.301 --> 27:18.738
- Hmm, interesting.

27:18.771 --> 27:22.141
That's not exactly the rÃ©sumÃ©
for a security post.

27:22.174 --> 27:24.176
I've heard that
despite your background

27:24.210 --> 27:27.079
in matchmaking,
you now live by yourself.

27:27.113 --> 27:28.681
- How is this relevant?

27:28.715 --> 27:30.750
- I need to know
whether you've been compromised.

27:30.783 --> 27:34.687
Your points of contact
are very relevant.

27:34.721 --> 27:37.690
Do you have any family
in this bloc?

27:37.724 --> 27:39.926
Old friends?

27:39.959 --> 27:41.127
- No.

27:57.343 --> 27:58.978
Who is your source?

27:59.011 --> 28:01.380
- I told you.
- I know what you told me.

28:01.413 --> 28:03.716
But you obviously aren't
the kind of agent

28:03.750 --> 28:07.086
to have this building
searched on a hunch.

28:07.119 --> 28:09.088
Someone told you something.

28:09.121 --> 28:11.190
- I'm telling you the truth.

- We'll see.

[dog barking in the distance]

to clean up...

28:23.903 --> 28:25.204
when he got home.

28:31.143 --> 28:32.979
I should have paid
more attention.

28:33.012 --> 28:35.281
- We both missed it.

28:45.057 --> 28:49.028
- [sighs]

28:49.061 --> 28:52.031
Jennifer has me.

28:52.064 --> 28:54.433
She knows what I did.

28:54.466 --> 28:58.437
She came to see me
while you were away.

28:58.470 --> 29:00.106
- What did you tell her?

29:00.139 --> 29:01.874
- Nothing.
That's the problem.

29:01.908 --> 29:03.843
I-I don't have
anything for her.

29:03.876 --> 29:06.445
They'd already ID'd Broussard
and the rest of the cell.

29:06.478 --> 29:08.180
I'm out of time.

29:08.214 --> 29:12.151
- You're an asset.
She's running you.

29:12.184 --> 29:13.419
- She wants Broussard.

29:13.452 --> 29:16.322
- So give him to her.
- I can't.

29:16.355 --> 29:20.059
- You won't.
- I can't.

29:20.092 --> 29:23.195
After I burned him at the loft,
Broussard cut off contact.

29:23.229 --> 29:24.931
If I tried to reach out
to him now,

29:24.964 --> 29:27.900
he'd know
I've been compromised.

29:27.934 --> 29:32.204
Will, I promise you,
I am done with them,

29:32.238 --> 29:34.273
but I have nothing
to give Jennifer,

29:34.306 --> 29:36.142
so I told her
that if she wanted a body,

29:36.175 --> 29:38.477
she'd have to settle
for mine.

29:38.510 --> 29:40.579
I asked Maddie
to take Gracie,

29:40.612 --> 29:43.149
and I was just waiting for
Homeland to kick the door in,

29:43.182 --> 29:46.552
and then you
and Charlie came home.

29:46.585 --> 29:49.188
I'm so scared.

30:00.166 --> 30:02.368
- It's okay.

30:02.401 --> 30:04.403
I can deal with her.

30:07.907 --> 30:10.176
- She's been loyal to you.

30:10.209 --> 30:14.513
She's the only reason
I'm still here.

30:14.546 --> 30:16.849
Maybe we trust her.
- No, we can't.

30:16.883 --> 30:20.119
- You think
she'd turn us in?

30:20.152 --> 30:23.122
- Jennifer's got a good heart,
but she's weak.

30:23.155 --> 30:25.257
It won't take much
to break her.

30:25.291 --> 30:27.526
She doesn't have
the experience

30:27.559 --> 30:29.929
or training
for this kind of thing.

30:29.962 --> 30:32.398
- If she sells us out,
we all go to the Factory--

30:32.431 --> 30:34.133
Gracie, Charlie.

30:34.166 --> 30:37.003
- I worked her before.
I can work her again.

30:37.036 --> 30:38.370
As long as she thinks
we're friends,

30:38.404 --> 30:43.009
I can keep her
from saying anything.

30:43.042 --> 30:45.945
I can handle her.

30:45.978 --> 30:48.948
[foreboding music]

30:48.981 --> 30:54.020

31:05.364 --> 31:06.999
[knock at door]

31:09.568 --> 31:11.037
- Yes?

31:11.070 --> 31:13.973
- I feel like we got off
on the wrong foot.

31:14.006 --> 31:16.575
I'd like to come clean,
start over.

31:16.608 --> 31:18.577
- I'm glad to hear that.

31:18.610 --> 31:21.247
Transitions
are always difficult,

31:21.280 --> 31:24.683
especially since I demand
a certain type of loyalty.

31:24.716 --> 31:26.452
Your lack of personal
entanglements

31:26.485 --> 31:30.122
actually might make you
a good fit.

31:30.156 --> 31:33.659
The Authority
can become your life.

31:35.527 --> 31:37.429
So what do you have for me?

31:37.463 --> 31:40.432
[dramatic music]

31:40.466 --> 31:45.204
*

31:45.237 --> 31:47.673
- Will Bowman...

31:47.706 --> 31:51.177
*

31:51.210 --> 31:53.045
- What about him?

31:53.079 --> 31:56.482
*

31:56.515 --> 32:00.486
- He's back
from Santa Monica.

32:00.519 --> 32:04.090
He'll be a big asset
to the office.

32:04.123 --> 32:06.692
- That's what you came here
to tell me?

32:08.494 --> 32:11.697
- My source
was Simon Eckhart,

32:11.730 --> 32:14.600
the English guy from Apis.

32:14.633 --> 32:17.736
He'd been calling me
from public pay phones,

32:17.769 --> 32:19.438
but he stopped.

32:19.471 --> 32:22.975
I don't know
if Broussard got to him

32:23.009 --> 32:25.611
or if he just got cold feet.

32:25.644 --> 32:27.646
- Why was he calling you?

32:27.679 --> 32:29.982
- Dumb luck.

32:30.016 --> 32:33.285
He called the tip line,
and they transferred him to me.

32:36.155 --> 32:38.557
- [sighs]

32:42.728 --> 32:44.530
I'm afraid you lack
both the skill set

32:44.563 --> 32:48.267
and the constitution
to be an officer.

32:48.300 --> 32:49.601
I'm therefore transferring you

32:49.635 --> 32:52.404
to the general
surveillance pool.

32:52.438 --> 32:55.041
Clean out your office and report
down there in the morning.

33:02.414 --> 33:05.451
- [humming "Amazing Grace"]

33:12.458 --> 33:15.161
All right, are you ready
to continue the lesson?

33:15.194 --> 33:16.628
- Mm-hmm.

33:16.662 --> 33:19.531
- Okay, we're going to start
with this card.

33:19.565 --> 33:21.567
- Obedience.
- Very well done.

33:21.600 --> 33:25.104
So that will go here
on number one.

33:25.137 --> 33:29.241
Good job.
All right, number two?

33:29.275 --> 33:31.143
- I don't know.
- You don't remember?

33:31.177 --> 33:32.811
- Mm-mm.
- Okay.

33:32.844 --> 33:35.547
Let's read a little bit
about that here.

33:40.519 --> 33:42.521
- Fire! Fire!

33:42.554 --> 33:43.722
- My book!

33:43.755 --> 33:45.124
- Lindsey!
- My book!

33:45.157 --> 33:46.692
Mr. Bowman, please help!

33:46.725 --> 33:48.427
- Jesus.
- No, no, no, no.

33:48.460 --> 33:49.628
- Stay put.

33:51.563 --> 33:54.032
- No, no.

33:55.301 --> 33:57.703
- [coughing]

34:00.872 --> 34:02.308
- You guys okay?

34:02.341 --> 34:04.476
- Yeah.
- What the hell happened?

34:04.510 --> 34:08.147
- I was making tea, and somebody
put a book on the stove.

34:08.180 --> 34:09.615
- Okay, it's all right.
It's all right.

34:09.648 --> 34:11.483
Everything's fine.

34:11.517 --> 34:14.586
- Uh, Lindsey, how about you
take the rest of the day off?

34:14.620 --> 34:18.224
- This is--
- I got your book.

34:18.257 --> 34:19.691
- This is so wrong.

34:19.725 --> 34:23.095
- It's okay.
It's all right.

34:23.129 --> 34:24.363
- I'm sorry, Lindsey.

34:24.396 --> 34:28.500
*

34:28.534 --> 34:31.303
Mom, that book
is really important.

34:31.337 --> 34:33.372
- She's gonna be okay.
Come on.

34:33.405 --> 34:38.210
How about you tell me
what happened in here?

34:38.244 --> 34:40.812
- I was just sitting
and reading, and I saw a fire.

34:54.926 --> 34:57.796
- What?

34:57.829 --> 35:00.399
- Smoke alarm didn't go off.

35:02.301 --> 35:04.770
We must have got to the fire
before the sensor tripped.

35:10.209 --> 35:11.377
[sighs]

35:11.410 --> 35:13.279
You shot me.

35:13.312 --> 35:16.348
- Sorry, I-I panicked.

35:16.382 --> 35:18.350
- Want to help me
get cleaned up?

35:20.686 --> 35:22.654
- Sure.

35:36.435 --> 35:39.271
Jesus.
- Be gentle.

35:44.543 --> 35:47.779

[somber music]

35:50.816 --> 35:57.789
*

36:10.336 --> 36:11.537
We're being watched.

36:15.607 --> 36:18.677
There's a camera in the smoke
alarm in the kitchen.

36:18.710 --> 36:21.213
It's probably
not the only one.

36:21.247 --> 36:24.316
We have to assume the whole
house has been compromised.

36:26.952 --> 36:29.321
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

36:29.355 --> 36:33.225
We can't talk about
anything in here anymore.

36:33.259 --> 36:35.627
You understand?

Okay.

37:05.424 --> 37:06.892
- Quayle came to me.

37:06.925 --> 37:08.494
He was ready to give up
the whole damn cell

37:08.527 --> 37:09.761
to save his own ass--
Broussard, you.

37:09.795 --> 37:11.730
He didn't even blink.

38:22.033 --> 38:24.336
Okay.

[sniffles]

38:27.038 --> 38:29.941

38:31.743 --> 38:33.412
- [whispering]
What are we gonna do?

38:36.915 --> 38:39.818
- We're gonna get
through it...

38:39.851 --> 38:41.820
together.

38:48.394 --> 38:51.797
Can't be any more lies
between us.

38:51.830 --> 38:53.999
- I know.

38:54.032 --> 39:01.006

39:20.626 --> 39:21.993
[knock at door]

39:22.027 --> 39:23.695
One second.

39:28.600 --> 39:30.769
- What are you
still doing here?

39:30.802 --> 39:32.704
- Just logging
out of the system,

39:32.738 --> 39:34.640

- Yes, we're going.

40:34.766 --> 40:36.535
- And you're recording this?
Is that what you're saying?

40:36.568 --> 40:38.470
- I think it's--
- [speaks indistinctly]

40:38.504 --> 40:40.706
- Okay, it's recording.
It's recording.

40:40.739 --> 40:43.108
- Okay, okay, we're ready.
- Guys. Ringo.

40:43.141 --> 40:44.710

- What?
- Long walk.

40:47.813 --> 40:49.214
What--hey,
how old are you, Ringo?

40:49.247 --> 40:52.117
You got to bark
as many times as your age.

40:52.150 --> 40:53.852
- Arf, arf, arf, arf, arf.

40:53.885 --> 40:56.187

Okay.

41:13.672 --> 41:16.675
It was amazing.
You were really good.

41:16.708 --> 41:18.544
You could totally get a job--

41:18.577 --> 41:20.679
Wait. I just learned.
Wait. Hold on.

41:20.712 --> 41:22.848
Hold on.
Let me get the front.

41:22.881 --> 41:25.984
Okay, buddy, let's do this.
You got this.

[melancholy music]

41:29.287 --> 41:31.156

41:31.189 --> 41:33.258
- It's--are you taking
a still picture,

41:33.291 --> 41:35.193
or are we taking an actual
full video right now?

41:35.226 --> 41:37.696
- It's a video.
- Okay, okay.

41:37.729 --> 41:39.164
- I love you.
- I love you, too.
