01:13.640 --> 01:16.820
Gentlemen, we are in danger.
There is a storm coming.

01:16.920 --> 01:18.740
My men are terrified. We must leave.

01:18.840 --> 01:21.460
That tomb is here somewhere.
I can feel it.

01:21.560 --> 01:24.420
- Please, Robert, it's been two months!
- Archie, I'm not stopping!

01:24.520 --> 01:25.740
Dad!

01:25.840 --> 01:27.740
What's going on with this wind, Pop?

01:27.840 --> 01:29.140
C.J, go wait in the truck.

01:29.240 --> 01:31.820
- I don't want to just wait in the truck.
- I said go! Windows up!

01:33.400 --> 01:34.380
Robert!

01:34.480 --> 01:35.681
- Mr. Fredericks!
- What?

02:02.600 --> 02:04.245
Help!

02:05.282 --> 02:07.057
Help!

02:39.480 --> 02:42.020
C.J? Are you all right?

02:42.120 --> 02:44.970
- Yeah, I'm fine!
- I'm coming down!

02:46.680 --> 02:47.660
Yes!

02:51.240 --> 02:54.020
I looked for the tomb of Ahkmenrah
for 20 years, and what do you do?

02:54.120 --> 02:56.129
You fall right into it!

02:56.920 --> 02:58.980
Amir, start loading the trucks.

02:59.080 --> 03:00.281
Mr. Fredericks...

03:00.440 --> 03:01.500
there is no time.

03:01.600 --> 03:03.260
The storm is almost upon us.

03:03.360 --> 03:04.660
Then you'd better hurry.

03:04.760 --> 03:06.485
Come on. Everybody works.

03:14.680 --> 03:16.848
Hey! What's the matter with you?

03:19.000 --> 03:20.860
He said, "We must leave
this place immediately.

03:22.320 --> 03:23.980
"If anyone disturbs this tomb...

03:26.040 --> 03:27.241
"the end will come."

03:31.800 --> 03:34.082
"The end will come."

03:41.480 --> 03:43.205
We load the trucks.

04:01.640 --> 04:04.940
I can't help feeling we're making
a terrible mistake!

04:05.040 --> 04:07.780
We're not making a mistake,
we're making history!

04:07.880 --> 04:09.100
Don't worry!

04:09.200 --> 04:11.607
C.J! Let's go!

04:20.720 --> 04:23.207
"The end will come."

04:34.720 --> 04:36.940
Welcome, everyone,
to the Grand Reopening...

04:37.040 --> 04:39.100
of the newly renovated
Hayden Planetarium...

04:39.200 --> 04:41.020
here at the Museum of Natural History.

04:41.120 --> 04:42.780
New York's glitterati
have all turned out...

04:42.880 --> 04:45.300
for what has promised to be
a memorable evening...

04:45.400 --> 04:47.260
filled with the dazzling
special effects...

04:47.360 --> 04:50.980
and technical wizardry we've all come
to admire from this museum...

04:51.080 --> 04:52.860
and its renowned Night Program.

04:52.960 --> 04:55.020
Tonight gonna be fun-fun!

04:55.120 --> 04:56.700
Here come Dum Dum!

04:56.800 --> 04:58.100
Hey, how we doing, Sac?

04:58.200 --> 04:59.860
Rexy is waxed and buffed.

04:59.960 --> 05:01.940
Teddy is grooming his moustache.

05:02.040 --> 05:05.300
Oh, and I reviewed fire safety procedures
with the primordial men.

05:05.400 --> 05:06.980
By the way, have you seen them lately?

05:07.080 --> 05:09.460
- The museum has added a new one.
- What? No.

05:09.560 --> 05:11.780
Oh, and make sure the
centurions stretch, all right?

05:11.880 --> 05:13.140
They really went for it
in the dress rehearsal...

05:13.240 --> 05:15.300
and they're just not used to
those kinds of dance moves.

05:15.400 --> 05:19.300
Okay, everybody. Everybody, listen up.
I don't want to make anybody nervous...

05:19.400 --> 05:22.940
but the mayor and the governor
are both out there.

05:23.040 --> 05:25.820
And, I'm not 100 percent sure,
but I think Regis Philbin, too.

05:25.920 --> 05:28.531
- Reeju Philbo?
- Yeah, Reeju Philbo.

05:28.760 --> 05:30.540
Okay, Rexy, do me a favor.

05:30.640 --> 05:33.127
Watch the tail, okay?
There's gonna be open flame.

05:33.320 --> 05:34.700
Oh, Dexter...

05:34.800 --> 05:36.060
how you doing, my man?

05:36.160 --> 05:37.340
All limbered up?

05:37.440 --> 05:38.660
Looking good. I like the tie.

05:38.760 --> 05:40.380
Got kind of a Chippendales
thing going on.

05:40.480 --> 05:41.740
All chalked up, ready to go?

05:41.840 --> 05:44.580
Good. Okay, everybody relax
and have fun, okay?

05:44.680 --> 05:45.881
Larry.

05:46.440 --> 05:48.005
You better come see this.

05:50.120 --> 05:52.580
- Have you ever seen it like this before?
- Never.

05:52.680 --> 05:55.580
This corrosion has never
happened before.

05:55.680 --> 05:58.180
It's always been exactly the same.

05:58.280 --> 06:00.180
I wonder what's up with it.

06:00.280 --> 06:01.860
I have no idea.

06:01.960 --> 06:03.020
And to be honest...

06:03.120 --> 06:05.800
my father knew the secrets of
the tablet better than I did.

06:06.880 --> 06:09.242
Unfortunately,
he swore he'd never reveal them.

06:09.800 --> 06:11.525
He never did.

06:17.960 --> 06:19.207
You okay?

06:19.560 --> 06:20.740
Yes.

06:20.840 --> 06:21.860
Yes, I'm fine.

06:21.960 --> 06:24.100
Just take it easy
out there tonight, all right?

06:24.200 --> 06:26.100
You got 15 minutes till showtime.

06:26.200 --> 06:28.020
We're gonna figure this out tomorrow.

06:28.120 --> 06:29.401
All right.

06:30.335 --> 06:33.060
Look at that! Doggone it!

06:33.160 --> 06:35.740
Did you see that?
They're trying to catch the light.

06:35.840 --> 06:38.940
I know. But you can't do it, boys!
You can't catch light!

06:39.040 --> 06:41.620
It's as elusive as human happiness!

06:43.640 --> 06:44.780
I should like to comment.

06:44.880 --> 06:46.220
- Summon the apparatus.
- Yeah.

06:46.320 --> 06:48.284
Summon the apparatus!

06:54.520 --> 06:56.563
What are you gonna say?

06:56.840 --> 06:58.041
L...

07:04.880 --> 07:06.206
O...

07:09.160 --> 07:10.407
L.

07:12.520 --> 07:15.326
"Laugh out loud."
Yeah, that's what I did.

07:15.600 --> 07:18.260
Now, post these adorable kittens

07:18.360 --> 07:21.484
with my edict of approval to Facebook.

07:22.200 --> 07:24.580
Give a big Texas "hell yeah"
from old Jedediah...

07:24.680 --> 07:25.860
because I loved it too!

07:25.960 --> 07:27.140
Just send a smiley face.

07:27.240 --> 07:29.260
Yeah, but with a wink!

07:29.360 --> 07:32.660
A smiley face and a wink!

07:32.760 --> 07:35.420
- Guys, what are you doing?
- We're just watching kittens.

07:35.520 --> 07:37.460
You're on in five minutes.
You got to focus, here.

07:37.560 --> 07:39.140
I told you we don't have time for this!

07:39.240 --> 07:41.090
You gave it a Texas "hell yeah!"

07:41.200 --> 07:43.660
- Hey, Teddy, ready to roll?
- Indeed, Lawrence.

07:43.760 --> 07:45.980
- Great.
- Battle of San Juan Hill cool as a cucumber.

07:46.080 --> 07:48.282
Right now, butterflies like you
wouldn't believe.

07:48.560 --> 07:49.580
You're gonna be great.

07:49.680 --> 07:50.660
- Lawrence?
- Yeah.

07:50.760 --> 07:52.180
Have you seen the Neanderthals lately?

07:52.280 --> 07:53.940
No. Why does everybody
keep talking about this?

07:54.040 --> 07:55.651
You may want to give it a look!

08:03.720 --> 08:05.660
Hey, guys, what's going on?

08:13.400 --> 08:14.820
Okay.

08:14.920 --> 08:18.120
All right, very funny. That's hilarious.

08:18.400 --> 08:20.980
You don't have to come down.
It's okay, really.

08:21.080 --> 08:23.442
Hi, how are you? I'm Larry.

08:23.600 --> 08:25.700
I'm Laaa...

08:25.800 --> 08:27.340
You're "Laaa"?

08:27.440 --> 08:29.340
Laaa.

08:29.440 --> 08:31.220
Laaa. Okay, nice to meet you, Laaa.

08:31.320 --> 08:32.965
Welcome aboard, and...

08:35.440 --> 08:36.820
Yes, we look similar.

08:36.919 --> 08:40.179
Yeah, we look like each other, I know.
It's a joke that somebody played.

08:40.280 --> 08:42.659
Dr. McPhee had you made to look like me.

08:42.760 --> 08:43.961
It's just a...

08:46.160 --> 08:48.561
Stop it. Stop, okay?

08:49.320 --> 08:51.010
- Dada?
- What?

08:51.280 --> 08:52.340
Dada.

08:52.440 --> 08:54.020
No, not your Dada.

08:54.120 --> 08:55.731
Yeah, Dada.

08:56.280 --> 08:58.020
- No. Stop.
- Dada.

08:58.120 --> 08:59.700
- Dada!
- Dada!

08:59.800 --> 09:01.843
No, I'm not his... I'm not your Dada.

09:03.120 --> 09:04.765
Dum Dum got a new son-son!

09:05.400 --> 09:07.043
No, he doesn't.

09:07.840 --> 09:08.940
Dada!

09:09.040 --> 09:10.890
Dada!

09:11.040 --> 09:12.780
DR. McPHEE:
A toast to our new chairwoman.

09:12.880 --> 09:14.889
Cheers, everyone. Cheers.

09:15.040 --> 09:16.844
Cue the music.

09:16.960 --> 09:21.051
And Teddy in three, two...

09:34.320 --> 09:37.524
Since 1869, when I was
a mere boy of 11...

09:37.680 --> 09:41.220
this museum has been a
shining beacon to our great city.

09:41.320 --> 09:44.140
Tonight we'll expand
our horizons even further...

09:44.240 --> 09:48.060
to the Sun, the Moon, and the stars.

09:48.160 --> 09:51.340
From our very beginning mankind
has looked to the heavens

09:51.440 --> 09:52.880
and given names to what he saw.

09:53.080 --> 09:54.725
The constellations.

09:55.080 --> 09:56.500
I thought you might like to meet them.

09:56.600 --> 09:58.040
Cue the constellations.

10:20.520 --> 10:23.405
Orion, the hunter!

10:29.720 --> 10:31.126
What?

10:33.920 --> 10:35.460
All planned. All planned.

10:35.560 --> 10:38.445
I knew that was gonna happen. So, yeah.

10:44.640 --> 10:47.660
Good. Going great, guys. Going great.

10:47.760 --> 10:49.460
Let's drop the silks.

10:49.560 --> 10:51.524
And go with the monkey.

10:54.480 --> 10:55.886
What?

11:08.320 --> 11:09.521
Come on.

11:20.520 --> 11:22.961
That's what I do.

11:23.200 --> 11:24.540
Thank you for your patronage...

11:24.640 --> 11:27.340
and for your unwavering support
of this fine institution.

11:27.440 --> 11:30.723
This newly renovated planetarium
will serve as a lens...

11:39.440 --> 11:42.180
"Once more unto the breach,
dear friends!"

11:42.280 --> 11:44.005
What?

11:49.360 --> 11:50.380
Charge!

11:52.800 --> 11:54.180
Rough Riders!

11:54.280 --> 11:56.580
- It's okay! Just hang on!
- Is this part of it?

11:56.680 --> 11:59.300
Sorry folks, a little technical issue.
What are you doing?

11:59.400 --> 12:02.140
Stick to the script. Stick to the script!

12:02.240 --> 12:04.363
- It's me!
- I don't know you.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.060
Pull!

12:18.160 --> 12:20.820
I don't know what's come
over me, but I like it!

12:20.920 --> 12:21.900
Drop 'em!

12:25.680 --> 12:27.580
Yeah! Yeah!

12:32.160 --> 12:33.725
What's going on?

12:43.000 --> 12:44.565
Do something!

12:52.200 --> 12:53.220
What are you doing?

13:05.360 --> 13:06.641
Orion, don't!

13:13.400 --> 13:14.601
Rexy!

13:24.120 --> 13:25.765
Guys, what was going on out there?

13:27.080 --> 13:29.620
Seriously, what were you thinking?

13:29.720 --> 13:32.140
Laaa, I got this, all right?

13:32.240 --> 13:34.363
Just... Go over there.

13:34.880 --> 13:37.060
No, go over there.

13:37.160 --> 13:38.361
Go.

13:40.560 --> 13:41.807
Attila...

13:42.240 --> 13:44.060
what were you doing
to that dolphin, man?

13:44.160 --> 13:45.180
It's a dolphin!

13:45.280 --> 13:47.060
It's one of the most
peaceful creatures on earth...

13:47.160 --> 13:50.967
and you're hacking into it like
it was The Cove or something.

13:51.240 --> 13:53.100
Did you see the look
on Regis Philbin's face?

13:53.200 --> 13:54.140
Reeju?

13:54.240 --> 13:55.660
Yeah, Reeju.

13:55.760 --> 13:58.060
Teddy, what were you doing
pointing a gun at me?

13:58.160 --> 14:00.420
Forgive me, Lawrence.
I don't know what came over me.

14:00.520 --> 14:02.131
Do you even remember that?

14:02.240 --> 14:03.340
Not at all.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.340
Laaa, shut that down!
It's a defibrillator.

14:07.440 --> 14:09.051
Put it down. It's dangerous!

14:09.280 --> 14:11.820
Laaa, that's electricity.
Those aren't headphones.

14:11.920 --> 14:13.645
Stop it!

14:14.080 --> 14:16.740
Oh! Hey! Whoa! Dexter!

14:16.840 --> 14:17.980
What are you doing?

14:19.640 --> 14:20.660
Honestly, if you're gonna
act like a baby,

14:20.760 --> 14:21.900
then I'll get you some diapers.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.326
You want diapers again?

14:24.680 --> 14:28.180
Ease up on the reins there, hoss.
Can't you see? He feels terrible!

14:28.280 --> 14:29.820
Hell, we all do!

14:29.920 --> 14:31.460
I don't know what's going on
with everybody here...

14:31.560 --> 14:34.020
but tonight was really weird.
Really weird.

14:34.120 --> 14:35.401
We feel awful.

14:35.680 --> 14:38.020
Something took hold of us
like an evil spell!

14:38.120 --> 14:40.482
Yeah, like we just weren't ourselves.

14:47.400 --> 14:49.300
- Hello?
- Larry.

14:49.400 --> 14:50.820
Hey, Dr. McPhee.

14:50.920 --> 14:52.270
Yeah, hi. How's it going?

14:52.370 --> 14:53.500
Okay.

14:53.600 --> 14:56.620
Good, good, good, good, good, good.

14:56.720 --> 15:02.689
You know that sound of when
you're hiding in a trash bin...

15:02.880 --> 15:07.140
fearing for your life because a Tyrannosaurus
rex is using it as a Hacky Sack?

15:07.240 --> 15:09.500
No. I don't know that sound.

15:09.600 --> 15:12.724
You don't know that sound?
Oh, hold on one second.

15:13.480 --> 15:16.940
That's the sound! That's the sound!
It will haunt my dreams!

15:17.040 --> 15:19.380
I'm sorry. Look, really, I'm sorry.

15:19.480 --> 15:21.820
I swear to you, I had no idea
this was going to happen.

15:21.920 --> 15:23.820
"I had no idea it was gonna happen.

15:23.920 --> 15:25.820
"I'm only in charge of
all the special effects."

15:25.920 --> 15:28.780
It was your fault!
They were your special effects!

15:28.880 --> 15:30.900
- No, I know.
- That's a joke.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.900
"Special effects"? More like "special...

15:34.000 --> 15:35.824
"defects!"

15:35.924 --> 15:37.860
Look, I promise you,
I'm gonna find out what happened.

15:37.960 --> 15:41.980
- Or they were "special rejects!"
- I'm sorry, Dr. McPhee. I gotta go.

15:49.110 --> 15:53.665
Hey! Nicky! Nicky! Stop hopping!

15:56.540 --> 15:58.900
- Dad, what are you doing?
- What are you doing?

15:59.000 --> 16:00.580
It's 3:00 AM.

16:00.680 --> 16:02.180
All right, party's over!

16:02.280 --> 16:03.925
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:04.320 --> 16:05.420
Who are you?

16:05.520 --> 16:06.780
- I'm Sophie.
- Sophie?

16:06.880 --> 16:07.900
Bye Bye Birdie?

16:08.000 --> 16:09.340
- Right.
- It was good.

16:09.440 --> 16:10.500
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

16:10.600 --> 16:11.700
See you tomorrow night?

16:11.800 --> 16:12.940
- Probably not.
- Probably.

16:13.040 --> 16:14.287
Definitely not.

16:15.040 --> 16:16.730
Bye.

16:17.480 --> 16:18.540
You're in so much trouble.

16:18.640 --> 16:20.444
I know.

16:23.280 --> 16:25.060
I didn't really know
you were coming home early.

16:25.160 --> 16:26.380
Yeah, that's pretty obvious.

16:26.480 --> 16:27.841
I mean...

16:28.160 --> 16:29.860
what makes you think this is okay?

16:29.960 --> 16:32.340
When I'm not at Mom's
you leave me alone, like, every night.

16:32.440 --> 16:34.220
Look, you can't be doing this right now.

16:34.320 --> 16:37.980
You got finals, your NYU application
is due in what, two weeks?

16:38.080 --> 16:39.441
I'm not gonna get into NYU.

16:39.600 --> 16:40.940
- You don't know that.
- No, I do.

16:41.040 --> 16:42.220
You don't know that.

16:42.320 --> 16:45.205
I do very much know that,
in the sense that I don't intend to apply.

16:46.200 --> 16:47.300
What?

16:47.400 --> 16:49.820
I don't think that it's the place
for me right now, Dad.

16:49.920 --> 16:52.460
Okay. All right, fine.
You want to spread your wings a little...

16:52.560 --> 16:54.740
get out of the city,
go to school somewhere else.

16:54.840 --> 16:57.140
I totally support that.
All you had to do was tell me.

16:57.240 --> 16:58.300
Where do you want to go?

16:58.400 --> 17:01.300
- What's the list?
- It's a short list.

17:01.400 --> 17:02.500
Great. I like it. Focus.

17:02.600 --> 17:05.619
I'mma hit you with a super short list,
man, because it's...

17:05.720 --> 17:07.285
There's nothing on it.

17:09.560 --> 17:10.700
There's...

17:10.800 --> 17:12.819
I'm confused,
because there's not a list...

17:12.920 --> 17:14.121
Dad?

17:15.800 --> 17:17.099
I want to take a year off.

17:17.200 --> 17:19.020
I would like to do exactly
what you just said.

17:19.119 --> 17:20.740
I want to spread my wings.

17:20.839 --> 17:22.140
You want to spread your wings,
that's great.

17:22.240 --> 17:23.700
But you can't spread your wings
and fly to nowhere.

17:23.800 --> 17:25.650
- Plans change.
- No, they don't.

17:25.839 --> 17:27.300
No, they don't. Plans don't change.

17:27.400 --> 17:28.620
We had a plan, it changed.

17:28.720 --> 17:30.100
- It's disorienting at first.
- No.

17:30.200 --> 17:31.380
You can't change the plan...

17:31.480 --> 17:33.420
unless you check with the people
who are financing the plan...

17:33.520 --> 17:37.165
which is, last time I checked,
your mother and I. Okay?

17:37.560 --> 17:40.300
Dad, we could sit here and just have
this conversation about plans...

17:40.400 --> 17:41.860
but for now, let's call it a night.

17:41.960 --> 17:43.460
Let's not even clean up, right?

17:43.560 --> 17:44.700
Let's come back tomorrow.

17:44.800 --> 17:47.540
Let's reboot the whole energy,
the whole tone of this puppy...

17:47.640 --> 17:48.620
and we'll kill it, man.

17:48.720 --> 17:50.340
Team Daley! Not tonight, tomorrow.

17:50.440 --> 17:51.500
Hey, Team Daley?

17:51.600 --> 17:52.540
- Yeah?
- Stop talking.

17:52.640 --> 17:53.700
Okay.

17:53.800 --> 17:55.140
You're gonna clean up.
I'm gonna go to bed.

17:55.240 --> 17:57.920
And then we're gonna finish
this conversation tomorrow.

18:12.760 --> 18:14.060
Yeah! Get some!

18:14.160 --> 18:15.361
Get some!

18:17.320 --> 18:19.363
That's it. Yeah.

18:19.880 --> 18:21.206
Hi.

18:21.400 --> 18:23.420
I'm Larry Daley.
I'm head of the Night Program.

18:23.520 --> 18:26.420
I know who you are.
You're the security guard.

18:26.520 --> 18:28.324
Yeah, also head of the Night Program.

18:28.600 --> 18:29.940
I'm doing some research...

18:30.040 --> 18:31.260
and I was wondering
if you could help me out.

18:31.360 --> 18:34.420
Night guard doing research.

18:34.520 --> 18:36.210
Ooh la-la!

18:36.320 --> 18:37.500
Yeah.

18:37.600 --> 18:38.980
I'm just looking for anything

18:39.080 --> 18:40.860
that you might have on
the tablet of Ahkmenrah.

18:40.960 --> 18:42.060
Center aisle.

18:42.160 --> 18:44.460
- Great.
- Halfway down, stacks on your left.

18:46.240 --> 18:47.487
Get it!

19:02.480 --> 19:04.060
So...

19:04.160 --> 19:06.727
what makes you so curious
about the tablet?

19:06.960 --> 19:08.571
Oh! Just...

19:08.720 --> 19:11.340
Just a hobby, you know?
Kind of an interest of mine.

19:11.440 --> 19:12.860
I wish I could talk to these guys.

19:12.960 --> 19:14.460
Well, you can't.

19:14.560 --> 19:15.540
Yeah.

19:15.640 --> 19:16.980
Because they're dead.

19:17.080 --> 19:18.100
Right.

19:18.200 --> 19:21.460
But, look at that one.

19:21.560 --> 19:23.125
Looks like a kid?

19:30.880 --> 19:32.605
You didn't know him, did you?

19:33.000 --> 19:35.060
C.J Fredericks.

19:35.160 --> 19:36.771
He worked here.

19:37.760 --> 19:39.700
- He worked here?
- Yeah, when he grew up.

19:39.800 --> 19:40.940
- No.
- Yeah.

19:41.040 --> 19:42.900
He was a night guard.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.531
Same as you.

19:45.360 --> 19:47.528
Wait a minute. C.J.

19:48.120 --> 19:50.129
C.J Fredericks.

19:50.280 --> 19:51.700
Cecil Fredericks?

19:51.800 --> 19:54.540
Sexiest night guard we ever had.

19:54.640 --> 19:56.540
Present company included.

19:56.640 --> 19:58.922
Boy, could that man move.

20:19.480 --> 20:20.580
Larry?

20:20.680 --> 20:21.881
Hey, Cecil.

20:22.160 --> 20:23.740
My God, it's been years!

20:23.840 --> 20:25.340
You look like you're doing pretty good.

20:25.440 --> 20:27.420
I've still got it, pal.

20:27.520 --> 20:28.780
What are you doing here?

20:28.880 --> 20:31.420
I need to talk to you about the tablet.

20:31.520 --> 20:33.529
What the heck is Short Stack doing here?

20:33.640 --> 20:35.460
Hey, Gus. You're looking well.

20:35.560 --> 20:36.807
Reginald.

20:37.120 --> 20:39.180
Are you here to frame us again?

20:39.280 --> 20:40.900
Send us back to the slammer?

20:41.000 --> 20:43.020
I didn't frame you.
You were actually stealing.

20:43.120 --> 20:44.980
And I was the one
that got you out of jail, so...

20:45.080 --> 20:47.140
- Yeah.
- We've got a nice life here.

20:47.240 --> 20:49.380
The past is the past. We've moved on.

20:49.480 --> 20:50.700
I don't think this guy's moved on.

20:50.800 --> 20:52.540
Listen to him, monkey face.

20:52.640 --> 20:55.100
We've put all that
tablet stuff behind us, Larry.

20:55.200 --> 20:56.380
It's old news.

20:56.480 --> 20:59.340
Besides, we really never knew anything
about that old tablet.

20:59.440 --> 21:00.780
We just worked there.

21:00.880 --> 21:02.650
Something's up with it.

21:03.280 --> 21:05.209
I told you, I can't help you.

21:07.200 --> 21:08.731
Maybe this kid can.

21:14.600 --> 21:17.041
Maybe we'd better talk alone.

21:17.440 --> 21:19.740
Expedition like that is a
pretty amazing thing...

21:19.840 --> 21:21.340
for a 12-year-old boy.

21:21.440 --> 21:23.420
I tried to move on...

21:23.520 --> 21:26.380
but there was something
about that tablet.

21:26.480 --> 21:30.207
It's turning green,
like some sort of corrosion.

21:30.960 --> 21:34.500
And something's happening
to Teddy and Dexter...

21:34.600 --> 21:35.700
Jed and Octavius.

21:35.800 --> 21:37.460
They're all acting weird.

21:37.560 --> 21:40.161
It's like the green rust
is affecting them.

21:40.920 --> 21:43.009
"The end will come."

21:45.040 --> 21:46.241
What?

21:46.800 --> 21:49.540
The locals, they warned us.

21:49.640 --> 21:52.340
They begged us to leave that tomb alone.

21:52.440 --> 21:55.723
I thought it meant the end of the world.

21:56.720 --> 21:58.331
But maybe it meant the end...

21:59.320 --> 22:00.860
End of the magic?

22:00.960 --> 22:02.161
We should have listened.

22:02.800 --> 22:04.380
Should have listened.

22:04.480 --> 22:07.660
Instead, we shipped Ahk
and the tablet off to New York...

22:07.760 --> 22:09.660
and his folks to England.

22:09.760 --> 22:11.060
Wait. Wait.

22:11.160 --> 22:12.980
Ahkmenrah's parents are in England?

22:13.080 --> 22:14.980
It was a joint expedition.

22:15.080 --> 22:17.420
Some of the artifacts stayed in Egypt.

22:17.520 --> 22:21.486
The rest was divided up between
New York and the British Museum.

22:21.800 --> 22:24.526
Ahk said that his father
knew the secrets of the tablet.

22:25.680 --> 22:27.450
I think I have to go talk to him.

22:27.560 --> 22:29.140
I need you to listen to me.

22:29.240 --> 22:32.380
Our esteemed chairwoman
asked for my resignation.

22:32.480 --> 22:35.820
She said, since the Night Program
was my brainchild...

22:35.920 --> 22:38.540
that the buck starts and stops with me.

22:38.640 --> 22:40.808
- I can fix it.
- How?

22:41.000 --> 22:44.204
I need you to let me take the tablet
and Ahkmenrah to London.

22:45.960 --> 22:48.140
Sorry. I'm just processing that.

22:50.480 --> 22:52.020
Input data analysis.

22:52.120 --> 22:53.620
I've just told you I'm being fired,

22:53.720 --> 22:55.100
and the first thing you ask...

22:55.200 --> 22:58.180
is if I'd allow you to take
some priceless artifacts...

22:58.280 --> 22:59.540
away with you on holiday.

22:59.640 --> 23:01.940
- Yes. Please.
- No way, José.

23:02.040 --> 23:03.700
I'm asking you to please
go with me on this.

23:03.800 --> 23:05.860
- Nah.
- Please.

23:05.960 --> 23:07.940
Can't do it, dude.

23:08.040 --> 23:09.241
Bye.

23:12.680 --> 23:13.820
- Are you gonna mug me?
- What?

23:13.920 --> 23:15.420
I don't know. Just be prepared.

23:15.520 --> 23:17.500
- I need you to listen to me.
- Oh.

23:17.600 --> 23:18.580
- Okay?
- Yep.

23:18.680 --> 23:20.380
- You want to know the truth?
- Go on.

23:20.480 --> 23:22.808
Truth is, the tablet...

23:23.320 --> 23:25.363
The tablet is actually magic.

23:26.600 --> 23:29.280
Things really do come to life at night.

23:29.640 --> 23:31.700
- It's special effects.
- It's not special effects.

23:31.800 --> 23:32.820
How could it be special effects?

23:32.920 --> 23:33.980
How could it not be special effects?

23:34.080 --> 23:35.580
- Because it isn't!
- Of course it is!

23:35.680 --> 23:38.020
- I'm telling you, this is what happens.
- What?

23:38.120 --> 23:40.060
Sun goes down...

23:40.160 --> 23:41.964
the tablet starts to glow...

23:43.640 --> 23:45.569
everything comes to life.

23:46.960 --> 23:48.700
- Sure.
- It's real.

23:48.800 --> 23:50.260
"Tablet starts to glow."

23:50.360 --> 23:52.260
Now I know you're mental.

23:52.360 --> 23:55.700
Look, Leslie... Listen to me.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

23:55.800 --> 23:57.809
I know. Just...

23:58.360 --> 23:59.641
What?

24:00.960 --> 24:04.100
Listen, nobody cares about this place
as much as we do, right?

24:04.200 --> 24:05.340
Yeah.

24:05.440 --> 24:06.540
If you don't help me...

24:06.640 --> 24:08.500
everything that's special
about it might stop...

24:08.600 --> 24:10.500
and it may never come back.

24:10.600 --> 24:14.401
I'm not asking you to understand,
I'm just asking you to trust me.

24:20.360 --> 24:22.860
I'd like to help you...

24:22.960 --> 24:25.606
but I don't even work here anymore.

24:27.160 --> 24:30.125
British Museum doesn't know that.

24:30.520 --> 24:33.326
The mummy and the tablet, both.

24:33.800 --> 24:35.140
Classic conservation job...

24:35.240 --> 24:36.940
under authority of me, of course...

24:37.040 --> 24:40.060
the director of this museum,
which I still am.

24:40.160 --> 24:41.691
Yep, okay.

24:46.400 --> 24:47.601
You're in.

25:12.600 --> 25:14.980
I really could have just stayed
by myself in New York.

25:15.080 --> 25:17.460
Yeah. No, that wasn't gonna happen.

25:17.560 --> 25:19.060
- Beautiful?
- Yeah.

25:19.160 --> 25:20.500
The River Thames.

25:20.600 --> 25:23.406
Isn't this cool, man,
you and me in London?

25:23.640 --> 25:24.740
- Huh?
- Yeah.

25:24.840 --> 25:28.761
Hey, I've been thinking
about that, year off.

25:29.880 --> 25:31.081
Yeah?

25:31.320 --> 25:32.760
I think it could be cool.

25:33.400 --> 25:35.100
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

25:35.200 --> 25:36.731
What are you thinking?

25:37.400 --> 25:39.260
Yeah. Wow.

25:39.360 --> 25:41.900
I think I want to DJ in Ibiza.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.060
In Ibiza?

25:43.160 --> 25:45.740
Ibiza, it's a small island
off the coast of Spain.

25:45.840 --> 25:47.660
- Do you speak Spanish?
- No.

25:47.760 --> 25:49.780
But that's the beautiful thing.
It's about the music.

25:49.880 --> 25:51.923
It's not inhibited
by the language barrier.

25:52.080 --> 25:53.820
No, but you are.

25:53.920 --> 25:55.260
- Do you speak in beats?
- Why are you freaking out?

25:55.360 --> 25:56.900
You just said this was
a really cool idea.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.100
I'm not freaking out.

25:58.200 --> 25:59.940
I just want to understand
what the plan is.

26:00.040 --> 26:01.820
You didn't go to college.

26:01.920 --> 26:04.168
Wait, now we're talking about
not going to college at all?

26:04.680 --> 26:06.689
- Maybe. I don't know.
- Nicky.

26:07.200 --> 26:08.660
Nicky. That's not...

26:08.760 --> 26:11.620
Dad, you didn't go to college.
You turned out fine.

26:11.720 --> 26:15.060
I turned out okay after about
20 years in a lot of dead ends.

26:15.160 --> 26:16.780
Whatever, man.

26:16.880 --> 26:18.980
Don't worry about me. It's fine.

26:19.080 --> 26:20.620
Hey, I'm always gonna worry about you.

26:20.720 --> 26:22.081
- I'm your dad.
- Thanks.

26:23.360 --> 26:24.780
Sun is going down. We should get going.

26:24.880 --> 26:26.081
All right.

26:35.520 --> 26:37.140
Dad, what's the plan here, anyway?

26:37.240 --> 26:39.780
When the tablet brings Ahkmenrah
to life, he's gonna sneak us in.

26:39.880 --> 26:40.940
- Now, get down.
- What?

26:41.040 --> 26:44.050
Just get down! Come on, man.
Part of the adventure.

26:53.520 --> 26:55.420
Hello. Welcome to the British Museum.

26:55.520 --> 26:56.580
My name's Tilly.

26:56.680 --> 26:57.900
Hi. Thank you.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.180
I'm Larry Daley from
Natural History, New York.

27:00.280 --> 27:01.700
- Yeah, yeah.
- I got a delivery...

27:01.800 --> 27:03.660
for your conservation department.

27:03.760 --> 27:05.500
All right!

27:05.600 --> 27:08.060
So they let you travel?

27:08.160 --> 27:09.340
This is kind of unusual.

27:09.440 --> 27:11.700
Well, they let me travel.
You know where?

27:11.800 --> 27:15.322
- No.
- Home. Here. Home.

27:15.720 --> 27:16.980
Back here.

27:17.080 --> 27:18.820
Off to the toot-toot.

27:18.920 --> 27:20.540
Five-minute maximum.

27:21.520 --> 27:24.860
So that must be well wicked being
a security guard in America.

27:25.560 --> 27:28.780
With your gun, with a silencer,
with your ninja swords.

27:28.880 --> 27:30.081
Right.

27:30.880 --> 27:32.780
That's not even a little bit true.

27:32.880 --> 27:36.323
The only thing that I got is this.

27:36.920 --> 27:38.860
- Oh.
- Hammer! It's for...

27:38.960 --> 27:42.300
and I quote,
"minor repairs and beautifications"

27:42.400 --> 27:43.860
to the shack.

27:45.680 --> 27:47.564
You just hit things?

27:48.640 --> 27:50.220
Yeah, that's catchy.

27:50.320 --> 27:51.660
Basically worthless.

27:51.760 --> 27:53.340
I can't believe
we're actually still talking.

27:53.440 --> 27:55.140
- It's great, though, innit?
- It is.

27:55.240 --> 27:56.980
This is the most conversation I've had

27:57.080 --> 27:58.780
in the three years
that I've worked here.

27:58.880 --> 28:00.740
I feel a connection, too.

28:00.840 --> 28:04.060
Is it cool if I just make my drop?

28:04.160 --> 28:05.900
- Oh, yeah.
- Wonderful.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.700
But I will have to confirm.

28:07.800 --> 28:10.060
Actually, that's not necessary...

28:10.160 --> 28:13.020
because they've already confirmed
it on the slip I gave you.

28:13.120 --> 28:14.860
Yeah, all right. Confirming.

28:14.960 --> 28:16.500
- Okay.
- All right.

28:18.520 --> 28:20.300
Hello. This is Dr. McPhee.

28:20.400 --> 28:22.140
It's the British Museum, sir.

28:22.240 --> 28:25.340
I'm just confirming a delivery
to our conservation department.

28:25.440 --> 28:27.140
Yes, I signed the paperwork.

28:27.240 --> 28:29.220
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a museum to run.

28:29.320 --> 28:32.540
You, boy, get those grubby fingers
off my Ming vase.

28:32.640 --> 28:34.410
See? Bye.

28:34.720 --> 28:35.921
All right.

28:36.920 --> 28:38.900
- Good?
- All right, you is legit.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.540
I is legit.

28:40.640 --> 28:42.220
- Wonderful.
- Confirm it.

28:42.320 --> 28:43.780
- Thank you.
- All right, I'll open the gate.

28:43.880 --> 28:44.860
Okay.

28:44.960 --> 28:46.740
Yeah, so, like, my boyfriend...

28:46.840 --> 28:48.620
he doesn't really like
the way I do my hair.

28:48.720 --> 28:51.420
Says it looks like a golden poo
sitting on my shoulder.

28:51.520 --> 28:53.722
But I really enjoy it.

28:55.280 --> 28:57.164
Bye, Larry!

29:43.240 --> 29:44.340
I'm not an expert...

29:44.440 --> 29:47.140
but this is feeling, just,
really against the law.

29:47.240 --> 29:49.886
No, they have a totally
different legal system here.

29:50.240 --> 29:51.380
Okay.

29:51.480 --> 29:52.500
How we doing?

29:52.600 --> 29:53.660
All clear.

29:53.760 --> 29:55.220
All right, let's go.

29:55.320 --> 29:57.460
Larry, the others felt, perhaps,
we could use some help.

29:57.560 --> 29:58.761
The others?

29:59.000 --> 30:00.780
Lawrence, I couldn't sit idly by.

30:00.880 --> 30:02.500
Our very survival is at stake.

30:02.600 --> 30:04.540
All right. Hey, Teddy. Good.

30:04.640 --> 30:06.524
Good man to have in a crisis.

30:07.960 --> 30:09.286
Attila.

30:09.440 --> 30:10.801
Okay, a little muscle.

30:11.440 --> 30:12.420
Hi, Larry.

30:12.520 --> 30:15.140
That is a deceptively large box.

30:15.240 --> 30:17.300
Obviously, we came along, too!

30:17.400 --> 30:19.380
You know you'd be lost
without us, Gigantor.

30:19.480 --> 30:20.820
Are you serious?

30:22.120 --> 30:24.243
And the monkey.
All right, basically everyone.

30:25.440 --> 30:26.420
Dada!

30:26.520 --> 30:28.688
Oh! No, no.

30:29.200 --> 30:31.971
No possible benefit whatsoever.

30:32.120 --> 30:33.620
He really wanted to come.

30:36.760 --> 30:37.860
Yeah, this is my son...

30:37.960 --> 30:39.650
my actual son, Nicky.

30:39.800 --> 30:41.900
- Nicky, this is Laaa.
- What's up?

30:43.800 --> 30:45.300
He's just tracking me.

30:47.600 --> 30:48.946
Laaa.

30:49.560 --> 30:51.860
So, Lawrence what's the plan of attack?

30:51.960 --> 30:54.925
We need to get to the Egyptian wing,
find Ahk's father...

30:55.520 --> 30:57.768
and hopefully get the tablet fixed.

30:59.040 --> 31:00.285
All of us.

31:03.720 --> 31:05.900
Laaa, that's not for eating.
That's not food.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.247
Don't...

31:07.400 --> 31:09.140
You know what? I got a job for you.

31:09.240 --> 31:10.521
Come on, come on.

31:14.880 --> 31:15.940
Come on.

31:16.040 --> 31:18.940
I want you to stay here
and watch this door, okay?

31:19.040 --> 31:21.460
Make sure nobody comes in or out. Okay?

31:21.560 --> 31:23.340
Good. You're gonna be a guard,
just like me.

31:23.440 --> 31:24.965
All right.

31:25.320 --> 31:26.740
No. Come here.

31:26.840 --> 31:28.420
Stay here...

31:28.520 --> 31:29.620
and put your hands on the door.

31:29.720 --> 31:30.820
- Good, stay.
- Stay!

31:30.920 --> 31:32.700
Good. That's right. You stay here.

31:32.800 --> 31:34.060
Stay here.

31:34.160 --> 31:35.600
Stay. Right.

31:35.800 --> 31:37.740
No. Stay.

31:37.840 --> 31:39.246
- Stay!
- Stay.

31:39.360 --> 31:41.940
Look there. Good. Stay.

31:42.040 --> 31:43.780
No. Good. Stay.

31:43.880 --> 31:45.260
No. Stay.

31:45.360 --> 31:46.540
Stay!

31:46.640 --> 31:48.180
Don't... Don't move.

31:48.280 --> 31:49.220
Don't move.

31:49.320 --> 31:51.682
No. Good. Okay.

31:54.800 --> 31:56.340
Okay, listen up, guys.

31:56.440 --> 31:57.980
This place is waking up
for the first time...

31:58.080 --> 32:01.921
and we have no idea what's out there,
so stay together, all right?

32:06.880 --> 32:08.180
I know it's spooky, big guy.

32:08.280 --> 32:10.369
Just stay close.

32:22.960 --> 32:26.926
What kind of haunted
hootenanny is this, boys?

32:31.080 --> 32:33.681
We're all finding this
super creepy, right?

32:34.160 --> 32:35.860
They're just a little freaked out.

32:35.960 --> 32:39.323
First time we came alive
it took some getting used to.

32:39.920 --> 32:43.169
Hey, there. Just heading to Egypt.

32:45.720 --> 32:47.449
Come on. This way.

33:00.160 --> 33:01.540
Hear that?

33:01.640 --> 33:03.001
Hear what?

33:06.640 --> 33:07.841
That.

33:09.960 --> 33:12.740
We'll just be down here
if anyone needs us.

33:12.840 --> 33:15.180
We're not scared.
It's just more comfortable.

33:15.280 --> 33:16.420
Lawrence...

33:16.520 --> 33:18.370
I think it's safe to say that
we're in a bit of trouble.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.020
I know how to handle this guy.

33:22.120 --> 33:23.560
You mind?

33:24.320 --> 33:27.321
- Thanks.
- Dad, what are you doing?

33:27.480 --> 33:30.206
How do you think I tamed your pal Rexy?

33:32.000 --> 33:33.201
Hi, there.

33:34.280 --> 33:36.820
I bet you're not so mean, are you?

33:36.920 --> 33:38.780
I bet you're not so mean.

33:38.880 --> 33:41.401
No, you're just a little puppy, right?

33:41.600 --> 33:43.260
You're just a little puppy
who wants to play.

33:43.360 --> 33:45.100
You want to play?

33:45.200 --> 33:46.260
Want to play fetch?

33:46.360 --> 33:47.460
Yeah?

33:47.560 --> 33:49.140
You want to play with this bone?

33:49.240 --> 33:50.220
Yeah!

33:50.320 --> 33:52.602
Here you go. Go fetch.

33:53.160 --> 33:54.361
Go fetch!

34:01.840 --> 34:03.540
- Lawrence?
- Yeah?

34:03.640 --> 34:05.922
- May I suggest a different plan?
- What?

34:07.399 --> 34:08.650
Run!

34:22.719 --> 34:24.649
Close it, close it!

34:31.040 --> 34:33.527
Okay. I think we're...

34:37.800 --> 34:39.967
Get back! Everybody, get back!

34:50.719 --> 34:52.780
All right. You don't want to fetch?

34:52.880 --> 34:54.420
- Fetch on this.
- What?

34:57.280 --> 34:59.500
Oh! Oh!

34:59.600 --> 35:01.211
- Oh, that's close!
- Need some help?

35:01.440 --> 35:02.971
- What?
- Move.

35:20.360 --> 35:21.561
Attila, you okay?

35:38.880 --> 35:41.003
- You might want to...
- No.

35:41.760 --> 35:44.566
Here hold this.

35:51.280 --> 35:53.608
That was actually very cool.

35:54.960 --> 35:57.140
Sir Lancelot, at your service.

35:57.240 --> 35:58.965
Thank you. That was amazing.

35:59.120 --> 36:00.220
Theodore Roosevelt...

36:00.320 --> 36:02.380
President of the United
States of America.

36:02.480 --> 36:04.260
I have no idea what that means.

36:04.360 --> 36:05.860
I'm Larry, and this is my son, Nick.

36:05.960 --> 36:07.500
You have a noble face, Nick.

36:07.600 --> 36:08.740
- Thanks.
- Thanks for the help.

36:08.840 --> 36:10.041
Now, you...

36:10.680 --> 36:13.100
You remind me of a man
I once knew at Camelot.

36:13.200 --> 36:14.340
Really?

36:14.440 --> 36:17.460
One of the Knights of the Round Table?

36:17.560 --> 36:18.700
No, Erik.

36:18.800 --> 36:20.001
Erik?

36:20.760 --> 36:22.020
Our fool.

36:22.120 --> 36:23.380
He was the funniest fool I ever met.

36:23.480 --> 36:25.500
He was so good,
he didn't even have to do anything.

36:25.600 --> 36:28.320
He could just walk
into a room and you'd laugh.

36:29.800 --> 36:32.660
- You have what he had. The gift.
- That's weird.

36:32.760 --> 36:34.660
- You could be a fool.
- I don't know about that.

36:34.760 --> 36:35.980
Oh, come on, of course you could!

36:36.080 --> 36:40.171
We'd get you one of those hats
with the funny little dangly bells.

36:40.440 --> 36:41.500
Dangly bells?

36:44.880 --> 36:46.060
"Dangly bells."

36:46.160 --> 36:47.980
Didn't I tell you? The gift.

36:48.080 --> 36:50.260
He does what seems like nothing.

36:50.360 --> 36:51.780
A sort of deadpan...

36:51.880 --> 36:53.180
tiny little...

36:53.280 --> 36:54.340
"Hmm." "Hmm."

36:54.440 --> 36:56.620
Expressionless, you know, sort of a...

36:56.720 --> 36:57.900
"Hmm. Hmm."

36:58.000 --> 36:59.060
sort of thing.

36:59.160 --> 37:00.620
Just like Erik.

37:00.720 --> 37:03.060
Sounds like a great guy.
We got to get going, so...

37:03.160 --> 37:04.260
Camelot.

37:04.360 --> 37:05.380
Okay.

37:05.480 --> 37:08.729
Someday, I shall return
to its mighty towers...

37:09.000 --> 37:10.440
to King Arthur...

37:10.920 --> 37:12.340
and Queen Guinevere.

37:12.440 --> 37:13.500
Sweet...

37:13.600 --> 37:15.484
beauteous Guinevere.

37:15.600 --> 37:18.460
But I'm sworn not to until
I have completed my quest.

37:18.560 --> 37:21.331
I must find the Holy Grail.

37:21.800 --> 37:23.100
Well, good luck with that.

37:23.200 --> 37:24.420
And thanks for the help again.

37:24.520 --> 37:26.100
We got to get to Egypt,
so we'll see you.

37:26.200 --> 37:28.607
- I will lead you.
- No, it's okay.

37:28.920 --> 37:30.180
Halt, Dangly Bells!

37:30.280 --> 37:34.060
There is strange magic in the air,
and dangerous beasts are afoot.

37:34.160 --> 37:36.100
It is the duty of a true knight...

37:36.200 --> 37:38.740
to protect and care for those in need.

37:38.840 --> 37:40.041
We're off.

37:41.640 --> 37:43.649
I guess he's coming with us.

37:45.720 --> 37:47.046
Larry!

37:49.160 --> 37:50.650
Jed and Octavius?

37:51.040 --> 37:52.940
They must have fallen out
while we were running.

37:53.040 --> 37:54.060
Jed?

37:54.160 --> 37:55.885
Octavius!

37:59.240 --> 38:00.851
Jedediah!

38:01.280 --> 38:03.005
- Jed!
- Octo!

38:08.080 --> 38:09.520
Oh, no.

38:14.880 --> 38:16.366
Is that Octavius's cape?

38:18.560 --> 38:19.761
Here.

38:20.760 --> 38:22.291
- Nicky.
- Yeah.

38:25.040 --> 38:26.241
Guys?

38:29.760 --> 38:32.580
Gigantor!

38:32.680 --> 38:34.020
Jed?

38:34.120 --> 38:36.300
They won't last long in those
heating vents, Lawrence.

38:36.400 --> 38:40.924
At their size, they'll bake like
tiny little scarabs in the Sinai.

38:43.720 --> 38:45.160
Too dark?

39:10.320 --> 39:12.100
This is the end, boy!

39:12.200 --> 39:14.846
This is the last roundup!

39:15.400 --> 39:17.250
Hold my hand!

39:18.320 --> 39:20.010
Why?

39:20.840 --> 39:22.485
Never mind.

39:36.920 --> 39:39.600
We're a long way from home, boy.

39:40.360 --> 39:42.881
Did you ask me to hold your hand?

39:43.840 --> 39:45.201
No.

39:48.920 --> 39:50.485
Jedo!

39:51.400 --> 39:53.045
Octo!

39:57.200 --> 39:59.880
They could be anywhere between
here and the intake vent.

40:00.744 --> 40:02.180
What do you see, Dex?

40:02.280 --> 40:03.580
You know he's a monkey, Lawrence.

40:03.680 --> 40:04.927
He can't talk.

40:07.000 --> 40:08.440
No, but he can fit.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.248
Nicky... give me your phone.

40:13.040 --> 40:15.004
- Why?
- For Dex.

40:15.360 --> 40:17.100
I don't understand one thing
that's going on here.

40:17.200 --> 40:19.971
I don't, either. Dad, what's going on?

40:20.960 --> 40:23.900
I'm sort of set up to track your phone.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.380
You're sort of set up to track my phone?
You track my phone?

40:26.480 --> 40:28.100
Yeah, I'm your dad.
I'm looking out for you.

40:28.200 --> 40:29.300
No. No. Hold up.

40:29.400 --> 40:32.100
"Spying on" is not the same thing
as just looking out for someone.

40:32.200 --> 40:33.500
You'll get it back, I promise.

40:33.600 --> 40:36.140
But right now,
it's going on the monkey's back.

40:36.240 --> 40:37.930
All right. Dex, come here.

40:39.640 --> 40:41.205
Thanks, man.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.860
Listen. I need you to go down there
and find them, all right?

40:44.960 --> 40:46.330
Think you can handle it?

40:47.840 --> 40:48.940
Good man.

40:49.040 --> 40:50.287
Stay safe.

41:10.160 --> 41:11.780
I think it's right here.

41:14.640 --> 41:15.780
"Right here."

41:15.880 --> 41:17.366
Classic.

41:17.640 --> 41:19.660
The gift of laughter.

41:19.760 --> 41:21.928
Thank you, Dangly Bells.

41:37.280 --> 41:38.606
First quest?

41:39.920 --> 41:41.380
Not exactly.

41:41.480 --> 41:43.100
I thought you were going to Egypt.

41:43.200 --> 41:45.060
We are, but we got to do this first.

41:45.160 --> 41:46.500
That's not how a quest works.

41:46.600 --> 41:50.725
A quest is one thing. It's not,
like, "Holy Grail and a monkey."

41:51.160 --> 41:53.561
Yeah, well, my guys are missing
and Dexter's gonna find them.

41:54.640 --> 41:56.860
What is the quest? Gold?

41:56.960 --> 41:58.420
Fountain of Youth?

41:58.520 --> 41:59.500
Magic tablet.

41:59.600 --> 42:01.723
It's that thing Ahk is holding.

42:03.920 --> 42:05.860
It shouldn't be too hard
to take it from him.

42:05.960 --> 42:07.889
He seems well-toned and lean...

42:08.000 --> 42:09.540
but weak.

42:09.640 --> 42:13.140
It would be like taking candy
from a feeble Egyptian baby.

42:13.240 --> 42:15.020
No, we're not trying to take it,
we're trying to fix it.

42:15.120 --> 42:16.780
There's something wrong with it.

42:16.880 --> 42:18.580
It's kind of complicated.

42:18.680 --> 42:22.660
It might be less complicated if you
stopped following a chimpanzee.

42:22.760 --> 42:26.043
He's not a chimpanzee, he's a capuchin.

42:28.480 --> 42:29.900
The fool seems agitated.

42:30.000 --> 42:31.406
That's often his way.

42:31.560 --> 42:33.250
But I assure you, he's no fool.

42:33.640 --> 42:35.940
Is it true what he says?

42:36.040 --> 42:38.820
The tablet that you carry is magic?

42:38.920 --> 42:40.360
It is, indeed.

42:40.520 --> 42:44.260
Everything around you has come to
life tonight for the very first time...

42:44.360 --> 42:46.296
all because of this tablet.

42:51.520 --> 42:53.290
Amazing.

42:54.160 --> 42:55.420
Then they're not real?

42:55.520 --> 42:57.540
They're as real as any of us.

42:57.640 --> 42:59.380
Yes, but we're real people.

42:59.480 --> 43:00.920
They're just things.

43:01.360 --> 43:03.060
And they don't even know.

43:03.160 --> 43:05.488
They must be unbelievably stupid.

43:05.680 --> 43:08.180
It can be confusing at first.

43:09.440 --> 43:11.180
Hello, frog!

43:11.280 --> 43:12.500
Keep hopping!

43:12.600 --> 43:13.900
You're real!

43:14.000 --> 43:16.601
Guys, I think we're gonna
have to cut through Asia.

43:18.960 --> 43:20.020
Not a clue.

43:20.120 --> 43:21.446
None.

43:30.480 --> 43:32.260
I can't really see much.

43:32.360 --> 43:34.740
We could jump down, hope for the best.

43:34.840 --> 43:37.420
But we have no idea what's down there.

43:42.280 --> 43:44.721
We don't know what's up here, either.

43:59.480 --> 44:01.489
This is a Roman city.

44:02.440 --> 44:05.420
I can feel the familiar pull of history
in its very foundations.

44:05.520 --> 44:07.768
Where the heck is everybody?

44:09.120 --> 44:12.005
I've seen this town before,
I'm sure of it.

44:13.560 --> 44:14.761
Romans?

44:22.760 --> 44:25.042
I see you have the name
of a lady on your arm.

44:25.520 --> 44:27.131
Andrea. Yeah.

44:27.560 --> 44:30.684
So this Lady Andrea is your Guinevere.

44:30.840 --> 44:33.441
Does any man stand
between you and your ladylove?

44:33.760 --> 44:36.361
Yeah, actually. My dad kind of messed
things up the other night.

44:36.560 --> 44:38.260
- Nick.
- Oh, we're stopping.

44:38.360 --> 44:40.700
Let no man stand
between you and your destiny.

44:40.800 --> 44:43.700
Oh, "destiny" may be
overstating it a bit.

44:43.800 --> 44:45.340
We just have calculus together.

44:45.440 --> 44:46.780
It's more one of those...

44:46.880 --> 44:48.420
fleeting moments of eye contact.

44:48.520 --> 44:49.660
"Who's gonna look away first?"

44:49.760 --> 44:52.281
But I get you. No man...

44:53.040 --> 44:54.685
- Good.
- Okay.

45:02.400 --> 45:04.921
"Iiepwop."

45:05.840 --> 45:07.849
Iiepwop.

45:08.080 --> 45:09.180
Doesn't ring a bell.

45:11.920 --> 45:13.580
Now who's this son of a gun?

45:15.520 --> 45:17.700
- Pompeii!
- I'm sorry.

45:17.800 --> 45:20.162
- I'm having trouble hearing you!
- Pompeii!

45:20.440 --> 45:21.940
No comprendo, amigo...

45:22.040 --> 45:24.860
because you got the thing
in front of you!

45:25.260 --> 45:26.730
What are they doing?

45:27.040 --> 45:30.020
Where in the blazes
are they stampeding off to?

45:30.120 --> 45:32.300
Was it something we said?

45:36.040 --> 45:37.540
Come on back to Iiepwop!

45:37.640 --> 45:40.100
- There's plenty of room!
- Come on back!

45:40.200 --> 45:41.900
They're as crazy as road lizards.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.123
People are strange.

45:48.440 --> 45:51.020
Hey, guy. We're just passing through.

45:52.280 --> 45:54.420
- It's a Garuda from Tibet.
- A Garuda?

45:54.520 --> 45:56.340
Hi, Garuda. How you doing?

45:56.440 --> 45:57.660
Garuda! How you doing?

45:57.760 --> 45:58.961
Cool, great.

45:59.960 --> 46:01.571
Okay. We just...

46:02.600 --> 46:04.882
You know what? We just got to get through.
I don't have time.

46:05.120 --> 46:06.740
Please. Okay.

46:10.640 --> 46:11.860
I'm not gonna play this game with you.

46:11.960 --> 46:13.446
I got to go through. Really.

46:24.680 --> 46:26.723
Get back.

46:29.960 --> 46:32.242
- A dragon.
- No, it's not a dragon. It's a...

46:33.880 --> 46:35.860
It's a Xiangliu.

46:35.960 --> 46:37.940
Mythical snake demon.

46:38.040 --> 46:40.060
It looks like a dragon.
I say we kill it.

46:40.160 --> 46:42.169
What? No, it's asleep.

46:43.160 --> 46:45.300
You're right. It's not very sporting
to kill it while it's asleep.

46:45.400 --> 46:46.820
Let's wake it up and then kill it.

46:46.920 --> 46:48.700
I shall go first,
and I shall take the boy.

46:48.800 --> 46:50.740
What are you...? No!
You're not gonna take the boy.

46:50.840 --> 46:52.883
- Why not?
- Because he's a boy!

46:53.000 --> 46:54.540
Larry, there comes a time
in every man's life...

46:54.640 --> 46:56.140
when he must slay his own dragon.

46:56.240 --> 46:57.340
Not this kid, all right?

46:57.440 --> 46:59.660
He still hasn't finished all his
thank-you notes from his bar mitzvah.

46:59.760 --> 47:01.620
Anyway, that's just an expression.

47:01.720 --> 47:02.740
Not where I come from.

47:02.840 --> 47:04.740
He's not gonna
slay his dragon right now.

47:04.840 --> 47:06.180
We're gonna go around it.

47:06.280 --> 47:08.180
We're gonna go around now,
or else we're gonna lose the signal.

47:08.280 --> 47:09.481
Come on.

47:13.960 --> 47:15.180
Iiepwop.

47:15.280 --> 47:16.620
Pompeii!

47:16.720 --> 47:19.540
Iiepwop. Are you sure you're
reading that right, pal?

47:23.120 --> 47:25.800
Pompeii!

47:39.800 --> 47:40.860
"Pompeii."

47:58.120 --> 48:01.244
"Ask not what your country can do for you...

48:01.480 --> 48:04.251
"Ask what you can do for your country."

48:04.640 --> 48:06.046
There it goes again!

48:08.000 --> 48:09.540
Attila!

48:11.440 --> 48:13.642
- Teddy!
- Charge!

48:16.480 --> 48:17.681
Whoa!

48:20.520 --> 48:23.967
Fantastic! It's awake!
Now we can kill it!

48:34.760 --> 48:35.780
Whoa!

48:35.880 --> 48:37.605
- Attila!
- Dad!

48:38.360 --> 48:39.766
Nicky!

48:40.240 --> 48:41.520
I'll get the boy!

48:46.520 --> 48:48.620
- Ever used a blade?
- Only in World of Warcraft!

48:48.720 --> 48:49.967
You're about to learn.

49:12.720 --> 49:16.686
"The only thing we have
to fear is fear itself!"

49:20.000 --> 49:21.486
"Doing a heck of a job, Brownie."

49:50.160 --> 49:51.300
Behind you!

49:51.400 --> 49:52.681
Duck!

49:57.680 --> 49:59.540
Last roundup, kemosabe!

49:59.640 --> 50:02.100
Time to slap on the barbecue sauce, boy!

50:02.200 --> 50:03.401
What?

50:21.480 --> 50:23.523
No, no! You wouldn't!

50:25.080 --> 50:26.361
He must!

50:33.520 --> 50:37.247
Clear!

50:57.440 --> 51:00.371
We must never speak
of what happened here today.

51:01.400 --> 51:04.060
Come on! That wasn't necessary!

51:04.160 --> 51:05.180
It's out!

51:10.320 --> 51:11.900
These things really do save lives.

51:19.520 --> 51:20.721
Are you all right?

51:22.080 --> 51:23.691
Are you all right, my dear?

51:25.000 --> 51:27.248
- You okay?
- Yeah, thanks.

51:29.320 --> 51:30.681
You fought bravely, sire.

51:31.200 --> 51:32.420
One day, I promise you,

51:32.520 --> 51:34.722
we shall drink dragon's blood
from the victor's cup.

51:35.680 --> 51:38.660
I'm good with just, like,
soda or water, too.

51:38.760 --> 51:40.780
But I like the energy we got going.

51:40.880 --> 51:43.651
From now on,
you must choose your own path.

51:43.880 --> 51:47.004
And let no man tell you otherwise.

51:50.200 --> 51:52.620
We better let Larry know we're okay.

51:52.720 --> 51:54.160
Turn around.

51:54.360 --> 51:57.166
Larry's probably worried about us.

52:07.000 --> 52:09.202
How are we going to find them now?

52:09.400 --> 52:10.886
Lawrence?

52:11.120 --> 52:12.980
I fear we've turned a corner.

52:13.080 --> 52:15.931
I'm becoming wax again, son.

52:17.880 --> 52:19.260
All right. We'll look for them later.

52:19.360 --> 52:21.244
We got to get to Egypt now.

52:21.640 --> 52:24.340
Wait, shouldn't we keep looking
for Jed and Octavius?

52:24.440 --> 52:25.660
Nick is right.

52:25.760 --> 52:28.020
A true knight never shirks his duties.

52:28.120 --> 52:31.529
If we don't get to Egypt soon
we're not gonna save anybody.

52:39.200 --> 52:41.084
Dada say, "Stay!"

52:41.320 --> 52:42.460
Stay!

52:53.000 --> 52:55.851
Dada say Laaa no eat.

53:00.120 --> 53:01.970
Stay, Laaa!

53:17.240 --> 53:18.566
This is it.

53:19.320 --> 53:21.180
Perhaps I should accompany you in.

53:21.280 --> 53:23.260
No, I think we got it from here.

53:23.360 --> 53:25.460
- Really?
- Yeah. No, we're good.

53:25.560 --> 53:26.886
Right. Well...

53:27.960 --> 53:29.060
friends...

53:29.160 --> 53:30.140
Larry...

53:30.240 --> 53:32.124
clown-faced keeper
of the magic tablet...

53:32.600 --> 53:34.260
I shall never forget your bravery.

53:34.360 --> 53:36.420
Nor your jests.

53:36.520 --> 53:38.051
Bye.

53:38.880 --> 53:40.580
I shall not say goodbye.

53:40.680 --> 53:41.700
- I am.
- What?

53:41.800 --> 53:44.260
I'm gonna say goodbye.
I have to go, I'm sorry.

53:44.360 --> 53:45.641
I'll see you.

53:47.560 --> 53:49.180
Really, man, thank you.

53:49.280 --> 53:50.720
For everything.

53:54.520 --> 53:57.724
I haven't seen these walls
for many a moon.

54:00.280 --> 54:01.527
Ahkmen?

54:02.680 --> 54:03.900
Mother.

54:14.280 --> 54:16.050
Father.

54:18.280 --> 54:20.209
Welcome home, my son.

54:25.360 --> 54:27.528
I want you to meet my friends.

54:28.840 --> 54:30.644
I am Merenkahre...

54:30.840 --> 54:33.820
Pharaoh of the Nile and Father
to the Son of the Sun.

54:33.920 --> 54:36.220
And I am Shepseheret...

54:36.320 --> 54:39.000
the Glittering Jewel
of the Nine Kingdoms.

54:39.440 --> 54:40.860
And I am Larry.

54:40.960 --> 54:42.340
Guardian of Brooklyn.

54:42.440 --> 54:43.540
Yes.

54:43.640 --> 54:45.340
I actually live in Manhattan now.

54:45.440 --> 54:47.380
I know, but it doesn't sound as cool.

54:47.480 --> 54:48.620
Yeah.

54:48.720 --> 54:51.540
We would be very honored if you
could take a look at the tablet.

54:51.640 --> 54:52.700
There's something happening with it.

54:52.800 --> 54:54.140
We don't understand what it is.

54:54.240 --> 54:56.780
You are speaking with a pharaoh.

54:56.880 --> 54:58.684
Kiss my staff.

55:05.160 --> 55:06.340
Is it okay if I don't?

55:06.440 --> 55:08.051
You will show respect.

55:08.280 --> 55:10.620
I am the descendant of Ra, the sun god.

55:10.720 --> 55:12.860
I understand that
and I totally respect you.

55:12.960 --> 55:15.300
I just don't pray to Ra, so...

55:15.400 --> 55:18.060
The Egyptian gods
are the only true gods.

55:18.160 --> 55:20.980
Well, we try to stay
a little more open-minded.

55:21.080 --> 55:24.860
I mean, Sacajawea,
she honors her spiritual ancestors...

55:24.960 --> 55:27.540
and you pray to some sort
of goat god, Attila?

55:27.640 --> 55:29.380
I'm half-Irish, half-Jewish...

55:29.480 --> 55:31.489
You are? I love Jews!

55:31.680 --> 55:33.420
We owned 40,000 of them!

55:33.520 --> 55:35.780
- Such lovely people.
- Here we go.

55:35.880 --> 55:39.500
They were very happy,
always singing with the candles.

55:39.600 --> 55:40.860
Yeah. They really weren't happy.

55:40.960 --> 55:43.900
- Really?
- No. They left.

55:44.000 --> 55:46.780
They spent about 40 years
in the desert trying to escape.

55:46.880 --> 55:48.660
Yeah. We have dinner once
a year and talk about it.

55:48.760 --> 55:50.460
It's a big deal for us.

55:50.560 --> 55:51.820
Listen, could you take
a look at that tablet?

55:51.920 --> 55:53.963
There's something wrong with it.

55:59.680 --> 56:01.006
It's losing its power.

56:01.200 --> 56:03.562
Do you think you could fix it?

56:04.720 --> 56:07.844
To do that, I would have to divulge
the secret of the tablet.

56:08.640 --> 56:10.620
I promise we won't tell anybody.

56:10.720 --> 56:11.921
No.

56:13.440 --> 56:14.700
I'll kiss your staff.

56:14.800 --> 56:16.001
Too late.

56:17.440 --> 56:20.860
Father, why do you insist
on keeping this to yourself?

56:20.960 --> 56:24.420
The secret was to be passed down
to you at the proper time.

56:24.520 --> 56:27.420
Well, it has been 4,000 years.

56:27.520 --> 56:29.529
Now seems like a good time.

56:32.800 --> 56:34.729
You were born at midnight.

56:35.360 --> 56:36.700
I was Pharaoh...

56:36.800 --> 56:40.420
and I had seen wonders
most men only dream of.

56:40.520 --> 56:43.530
But when I first gazed upon you...

56:44.360 --> 56:46.100
you were instantly
more precious to me...

56:46.200 --> 56:48.607
than all the wonders
of the ancient world.

56:49.280 --> 56:51.926
I knew I could never bear
to say goodbye.

56:53.520 --> 56:58.060
I commanded the High Priest to create
a gift to you, my son...

56:58.160 --> 57:02.140
using all we had learned of
the mysteries of the afterlife.

57:02.240 --> 57:05.523
Forged in the temple of Khonsu,
god of the moon...

57:06.040 --> 57:08.049
and watcher over nighttime travelers...

57:10.880 --> 57:13.500
the Tablet of Ahkmenrah.

57:13.600 --> 57:17.580
Our tomb was designed to channel
Khonsu's rays down to the tablet...

57:17.680 --> 57:20.500
rejuvenating its powers every night.

57:20.600 --> 57:23.380
The moon god bestowed
his power upon the tablet...

57:23.480 --> 57:26.340
so that, as long as
it bathed in his light...

57:26.440 --> 57:28.660
our family could be together forever,

57:28.760 --> 57:31.440
and not even death could part us.

57:34.560 --> 57:37.001
It's been away
from Khonsu's light too long.

57:47.200 --> 57:48.540
My son!

57:48.640 --> 57:50.729
What is happening to you?

57:51.560 --> 57:52.780
It needs moonlight...

57:52.880 --> 57:55.128
otherwise we shall all
be dead by sunrise.

57:55.440 --> 57:56.641
Hurry!

57:57.280 --> 57:58.700
If the tablet dies...

57:58.800 --> 58:00.411
nothing can bring it back!

58:18.200 --> 58:19.300
What are you doing?

58:19.400 --> 58:21.125
The tablet. Now.

58:22.640 --> 58:24.860
Wait, listen to me. That thing is dying.

58:24.960 --> 58:26.580
If it doesn't get moonlight...

58:26.680 --> 58:28.540
everything ends, like, for real.

58:28.640 --> 58:30.900
King Arthur wasted years searching
for the Holy Grail.

58:31.000 --> 58:32.700
To think it was a tablet all along.

58:32.800 --> 58:34.660
Would you just give it to me?
You don't know what you're doing!

58:34.760 --> 58:36.380
My quest is complete.

58:36.480 --> 58:37.820
I ride for Camelot tonight.

58:37.920 --> 58:39.300
Just keep it, okay?

58:39.400 --> 58:42.020
But just put it in the moonlight
and turn that center piece.

58:42.120 --> 58:45.085
Sorry, not my first quest.

58:46.040 --> 58:49.180
And by the way,
Erik was much funnier than you!

58:49.280 --> 58:51.140
Go get the others.

58:51.240 --> 58:53.442
We can't let him leave the building!

59:04.480 --> 59:06.940
Whoa! Easy there, partner! Slow it down!

59:07.040 --> 59:08.460
I don't know who you are...

59:08.560 --> 59:11.814
but I'm pretty dang sure
that tablet don't belong to you.

59:12.214 --> 59:16.060
Now wait a second!
Come back here! This ain't over!

59:16.160 --> 59:18.980
You'll rue the day you
mocked us with your huge sword

59:19.080 --> 59:21.408
and hypnotic blue eyes!

59:23.480 --> 59:25.125
His eyes are very blue.

59:31.000 --> 59:32.964
Speak softly and carry a big stick.

59:38.200 --> 59:39.940
Lawrence, we have a problem.

59:40.040 --> 59:42.020
This one turned to wax as well.

59:42.120 --> 59:44.368
I have a saying, too.

59:44.480 --> 59:47.411
"Speak loudly and carry a bigger stick."

01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:10.140
- It's over there!
- You mean up there.

01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:11.601
Come on.

01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:19.487
Got it.

01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:29.940
- Teddy.
- The tablet, now!

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:32.180
I shan't ask you again, fool!

01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:33.740
And this is giving me a headache!

01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:35.620
Give me the tablet!

01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:36.921
Let me go, Lawrence.

01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:38.730
No! Teddy, no!

01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:40.881
Teddy!

01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:52.761
There.

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:03.805
That'll be mine.

01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:08.100
Hey, that was a good one.

01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:09.640
No idea that would work.

01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:26.700
Larry!

01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:28.740
Hey, you guys, how you doing?

01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:29.980
Still in one piece!

01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:32.220
- Octavius, I think this belongs to you.
- Thank you.

01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:33.460
I don't understand.

01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:35.740
Why is Lancelot staying strong
while we get weaker?

01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:36.940
It's his first night.

01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:38.620
Newborns are stronger
but it matters not.

01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:41.500
Unless we succeed, he, too,
will be dead come the dawn.

01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:42.700
We can't let him leave the building.

01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:44.660
Sir, can you go back to Egypt,
in case he comes through there?

01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:46.580
- Of course.
- Nicky, take Attila, check the loading dock.

01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:48.740
- Got it.
- Teddy, go to the South Wing, cover the side doors.

01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:50.485
I got the main entrance.

01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:04.340
You! I knew you smelled a bit off!

01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:06.820
- Didn't you just see that?
- See what?

01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:08.460
The knight on the horse
that just rode through!

01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:10.860
Stop trying to distract me
with your magical fantasy!

01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:13.362
I found your filthy twin, here,
in the freight room!

01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:14.540
He's not my twin.

01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:16.900
I got him, and what could
he say for himself?

01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:22.060
Shut up! Shut up in your face!

01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:24.044
Shut up right now!
Do you want to be smashed?

01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:26.700
Yeah, you can run,
but if you leave those gates...

01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:28.980
I swear to you,
your hideous doppelganger...

01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:31.580
who looks a lot like the lead singer
of the Counting Crows...

01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:33.006
will get it!

01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:34.540
Dada.

01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:35.700
That's right.

01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:37.764
It compute with him.

01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:39.931
Dada.

01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:45.740
Damn it!

01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:47.860
Laaa.

01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:51.050
If you see me do something dumb,
don't imitate me, okay?

01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:56.721
It's basically what I keep telling Nick.

01:02:57.520 --> 01:02:59.848
He just doesn't get it, you know?

01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:02.780
I mean, he's a smart kid...

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:05.811
but I just want to give him
the tools that I didn't have.

01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:11.340
I mean, get the degree,
then take a break.

01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:12.420
Get the degree, then take a break.

01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:16.420
Laaa! Laaa, stop that!

01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:17.926
Stop it!

01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:35.081
Okay.

01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:51.060
What? Excuse me! Hey!

01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:52.900
Hi. Hey. Sorry.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.380
I'm Nick, this is Dexter,
Attila the Hun.

01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:56.980
Oh, yes, so lovely to meet you.

01:03:57.080 --> 01:03:58.566
Now meet this hammer!

01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:01.891
Don't do that.

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:05.900
I'm super sorry. I know it's
a lot going on, Hun, monkey.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.820
Wow, what? So much weird.
Huge amount to process.

01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:10.420
Right? Okay, sorry.

01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:12.340
- Thank you.
- You won't get away with this!

01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:15.500
I'm making sketches of you
in my mind right now!

01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:17.300
Boy with freckles,

01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:20.968
fat Asian with hair extensions,
evil monkey.

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:26.245
I guess it's just parenting, you know?

01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:27.980
And he comes from a divorced family...

01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:30.860
so I'm sure he has a lot of conflicted
feelings about me...

01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:34.700
and there might be some
Oedipal stuff at play in there, or...

01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:35.860
I get it.

01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:37.180
I wasn't there a lot of the time.

01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:39.460
So I think I might be
projecting my own guilt...

01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:41.180
and taking it out on him in ways...

01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:43.060
that I'm not even aware of.

01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:46.161
What?

01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:50.000
Door.

01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:53.641
Head.

01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:55.300
Okay, I...

01:04:58.320 --> 01:04:59.760
Open...

01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:01.620
head.

01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:03.380
Open your mind!

01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:06.140
Yes! Yeah, well, you're right.

01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:07.380
That's the challenge.

01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:09.900
I mean, it's all contextual, and I do.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.740
I keep looking at him through the lens
of how my parents raised me...

01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:15.060
when, in reality, he's his own person.

01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:16.380
And, yeah, we share the same DNA...

01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:19.060
but honestly, he's much more
evolved than I ever was.

01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:21.900
I don't want to let my own ego
and childhood history...

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.060
stop him from making the mistakes
he needs to make...

01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:25.780
to become the person
that he's meant to be.

01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:29.900
Open the door with your head.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.020
Yes!

01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:33.243
Good, Laaa. Let's go!

01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:37.580
- Everybody okay?
- Yes, Lawrence.

01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:39.940
Attila and your boy secured
the lady guard in her booth.

01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:41.660
I don't know how long
it will hold her, though.

01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:42.900
We gotta find Lancelot...

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.884
but somebody has to make sure
she doesn't get out.

01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:48.900
Yeah. Laaa, okay.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.690
You know what you have to do?

01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:52.020
Stay!

01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:53.940
That's right. Just make sure
she stays in there.

01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:55.940
- Stay!
- Good! Go!

01:05:56.040 --> 01:05:57.685
Dada say, "Stay"!

01:05:57.880 --> 01:05:58.940
Lawrence!

01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:00.260
I can't move my arms.

01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:02.460
We're becoming less useful
by the minute.

01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:04.841
Whoa, whoa!

01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:06.925
Come on, big guy.

01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:10.206
What? You okay there?

01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:13.340
Something's up with your eye, but...

01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:16.700
I don't know. It's just kind of going...

01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:20.764
You gotta relax, okay?

01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:22.620
Calm down!

01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:24.140
Attila! Attila!

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:27.609
Attila doesn't hyperventilate.

01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:30.287
You pillage!

01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:32.684
You plunder!

01:06:33.010 --> 01:06:35.635
You don't freak out. Okay?

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.580
Dad, there's, like,
8 million people in this city.

01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:40.530
He could be literally anywhere by now.

01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:41.921
We'll find him.

01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:44.361
We have to.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.486
I'm coming, my love.

01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:06.801
Blimey!

01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:11.340
He came this way...

01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:13.340
traveling 4 leagues per hour.

01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:23.980
No!

01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:26.282
Never run from a big cat, Lawrence.

01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:28.404
Gigantor, get your flashlight out!

01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:30.689
These cats want to play!

01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:34.402
Whoo-wee! He's got it, boy!

01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:43.780
Well played, sir.

01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:45.320
Run!

01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:51.922
Where the devil could Lancelot be?

01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:57.801
Come on!

01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:05.660
You better let me out of here,
you revolting ape-man!

01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:08.220
What are you staring at?
Stop looking at me!

01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:11.540
Have you never seen a beautiful,
attractive, gorgeous woman before...

01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:14.580
who could be a model if she
didn't love pizza so much?

01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:16.340
I know what you're playing at...

01:08:16.439 --> 01:08:18.846
and it ain't working.

01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:22.365
Not working.

01:08:28.319 --> 01:08:30.488
Wait, it is kind of working.

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:46.721
What have they done to Camelot?

01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:52.410
In short, there's simply not
A more congenial spot

01:08:53.479 --> 01:08:56.460
For happily ever-aftering

01:08:56.560 --> 01:08:59.220
Than here in...

01:08:59.319 --> 01:09:01.600
- Camelot
- At long last!

01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:04.380
- Guinevere, my love.
- Hi.

01:09:04.479 --> 01:09:07.046
Can I help you, mate?

01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:09.361
It is I...

01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:10.779
Sir Lancelot.

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:12.620
I have fulfilled my quest.

01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:14.260
Sorry. I'm sorry.

01:09:14.359 --> 01:09:15.460
I'm not actually Guinevere.

01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:17.899
I'm Alice Eve, and I think
you got a bit confused.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.899
- Maybe you saw me on stage...
- Your voice is like music...

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.819
but I have no idea what you're saying.

01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:23.380
Okay. Hey.

01:09:23.479 --> 01:09:24.939
Hey, man.

01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:26.446
Hey, buddy.

01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:30.740
What she's saying is she's not Guinevere
because she's an actor.

01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:32.740
Okay? So am I.

01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:33.979
An actor?

01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:35.140
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:36.500
You know?

01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:37.660
Do the crown.

01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:40.300
Oh, sorry, of course. Hugh Jackman.

01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:44.340
It was the crown.

01:09:44.439 --> 01:09:45.640
I know, the whole...

01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:47.740
Huge Ackman?

01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:49.340
That's a ridiculous name!

01:09:49.439 --> 01:09:50.660
It doesn't even sound real!

01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:53.180
Only a coward would conceal
his true identity, Arthur.

01:09:53.279 --> 01:09:54.660
No, it's Hugh Jackman.

01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:55.940
I, on the other hand...

01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:59.246
carry the treasure you sought
but could never find.

01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:03.860
Behold the key to life everlasting!

01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:05.460
Okay, I love the costume...

01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:06.660
I love the enthusiasm...

01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:08.540
but you're gonna have
to get off stage now.

01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:10.860
Sir Lancelot, ladies and gentlemen.
Sir Lancelot.

01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:12.060
Yes!

01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:13.260
Very good.

01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:15.289
Shame on you, Arthur!

01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:18.740
You don't deserve your crown,
and you don't deserve your queen!

01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:23.820
Prepare to feel the cold kiss
of my blade...

01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:25.020
Huge Ackman!

01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:28.700
Hey, buddy, this is all pretend.

01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:30.365
See, just...

01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:34.611
Well, that's not real.

01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:36.684
None of it is.

01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:44.820
It's not real.

01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:46.020
It was a good performance.

01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:47.860
- We were right in there.
- You were tonight.

01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:49.180
But it's not real-real.

01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:50.811
It's not real.

01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:56.125
Not real?

01:10:56.840 --> 01:10:59.580
Do you know how long
I dreamed of Camelot?

01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:03.161
And for what? For nothing!

01:11:04.324 --> 01:11:06.740
- Jeez!
- Nothing!

01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:09.691
No, no, no.
Please just take your seats and...

01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:18.041
What's up?

01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:22.247
We're just as God made us.

01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:25.060
Why don't you take a picture?

01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:26.885
It'll last longer.

01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:35.580
Okay, I've tried being nice.
That's enough.

01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:37.540
Get off the stage right now!

01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:39.500
Stay back! You don't scare me...

01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:40.620
Huge Ackman.

01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:42.460
Listen, mate, you don't
want to fight me, all right?

01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:44.380
If we go, I will break you.

01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:47.140
Come on!

01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:50.740
What is that?

01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:51.900
What are you doing?

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:55.020
- He's doing his Wolverine thing.
- Yeah.

01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:56.900
- Yeah.
- You know?

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:58.780
It's better with the claws and no shirt.

01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:00.081
Fair.

01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:01.460
Lancelot!

01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:02.921
Lancelot!

01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:10.660
Oi, mate!

01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:12.380
Hey, buddy, that's not an exit!

01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:13.980
Yeah, come on up.

01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:15.580
Yep. Come on up!

01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:16.780
Oh, monkeys. Terrific.

01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:18.140
I love the costumes.

01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:21.420
Sorry. I just gotta say,
you're the whole package, man.

01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:22.801
Thanks, buddy.

01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:25.928
- He recognized you.
- Yeah, that was awesome.

01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:28.300
Hey! Give me the tablet!

01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:30.443
Stay back! Stay back.

01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:31.900
- Stand back!
- Whoa!

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.281
Back!

01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:36.041
What?

01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:37.660
Your..

01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:40.340
- Your nose, it's...
- What about my nose?

01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:41.780
Your nose is dripping.

01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:44.805
- What?
- It's melting. From the fire.

01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:50.720
Okay.

01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:51.940
How bad is it?

01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:53.500
It is not great.

01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:54.860
But I'm Lancelot!

01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:56.020
There never was a Lancelot!

01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:57.300
Lancelot is a legend.

01:12:57.400 --> 01:12:59.020
You're not real.

01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:00.180
I don't understand!

01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:02.540
I know it's a lot to take in,
but please, just give me the tablet.

01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:04.860
Oh, and then what? Back to the museum?

01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:07.300
Stand there as little children
ogle and point?

01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:08.681
And learn.

01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:11.140
And get inspired to do great things.

01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:13.220
There are far less noble fates,
my friend.

01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:14.860
Not for me, there aren't!

01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:16.820
If there is no Camelot...

01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:20.380
there is no Guinevere and no Lancelot...

01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:23.700
then I'm nothing.
I'm just a sad lump of misshapen wax.

01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:25.300
Stop looking at my nose!

01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:27.011
- I wasn't looking at it.
- You were, I saw you.

01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:28.900
You were like this. "Hmm, hmm." Staring.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.140
- I wasn't like that.
- You were!

01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:31.220
Don't look at it!

01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:33.340
It really is hard not to look at.

01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:35.369
Yes, he is.

01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:38.220
- I didn't.
- I saw you!

01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:40.980
- No, I'm looking at your eyes.
- Monkey, stop it!

01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:42.860
Could you give me the tablet, please?
Give me the tablet.

01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:44.140
If you give me the tablet,
I promise I won't...

01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:45.380
Do not look at my nose!

01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:46.900
- Give me the tablet.
- Look away.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.580
- Give me the tablet.
- How hard could it be not to look at my nose?

01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:51.180
I'm not gonna look at your nose.

01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:53.801
- I can't help it!
- Look to the heavens!

01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:56.740
It's disgusting.

01:13:56.840 --> 01:13:58.420
Yet, he's still handsome.

01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:03.726
No one shall look at, or mention,
my nose from this moment forward!

01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:08.580
I'm sorry, I forgot
what we were talking about.

01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:15.447
Lawrence.

01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:17.401
Oh, Teddy!

01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:21.841
Larry.

01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:24.889
We've run out of time.

01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:28.620
Listen to me.
You got to straighten the pieces.

01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:30.780
Straighten the pieces right now
or they're all gonna die!

01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:31.860
You too!

01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:34.891
A world without Camelot is not
a world worth living in.

01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:38.447
Dad!

01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:42.566
Dexter, what is it?

01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:43.881
You all right?

01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:47.001
Hey.

01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:48.620
Hey, man, you okay?

01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:50.524
Hey, look at me.

01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:53.820
Yeah, you want to slap me? Go ahead.

01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:55.690
Go ahead, slap me in the face.

01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:00.241
Dex?

01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:08.127
Dexter?

01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:09.601
Dexter?

01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:12.820
Oh! No, no. No.

01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:15.340
Dexter? No, no. Come on, man!

01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:17.244
Dad, he's gone.

01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:28.962
I'll take that hand now.

01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:37.320
I understand now.

01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:41.020
The monkey was the quest.

01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:43.084
It was never about the tablet.

01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:49.651
It was about them.

01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:53.640
Forgive me.

01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:56.643
It is I who have been the fool.

01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:17.580
We're back, baby!

01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:18.881
Lawrence!

01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:21.580
Whoa!

01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:22.820
Hey!

01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:24.220
Welcome back, buddy.

01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:29.006
Hey.

01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:30.500
Well done, Larry!

01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:32.340
There he is. That's our guy.

01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:33.846
Come here!

01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:35.900
Here's your tablet.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.220
It feels good, doesn't it, Jedediah?

01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:40.010
Boy, you said it!

01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:45.970
Hey. Thank you.

01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:02.251
How do I look?

01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:05.924
You look like Lancelot.

01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:19.607
Well done, my child.

01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:26.241
Thank you...

01:17:26.680 --> 01:17:29.281
for bringing my son home safely.

01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:32.609
It's a strange thing...

01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:37.380
seeing your boy become a man.

01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:39.060
There were lions chasing us.

01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:42.125
Yeah, it's crazy.

01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:45.300
One day, they're riding a dinosaur
through Central Park...

01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:49.571
and then the next day
they're DJ-ing in Ibiza.

01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:55.442
You've served my family well.

01:17:55.720 --> 01:17:58.940
We shall build a great tomb
and bury you with many riches.

01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:01.460
I, personally, will see to it
that your organs are removed...

01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:04.491
and placed in separate
jewel-encrusted jars.

01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:08.441
Thank you.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:10.406
It's the right thing to do.

01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:12.180
Then we're agreed.

01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:13.500
Lawrence...

01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:14.740
may I have a word?

01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:16.140
Yeah.

01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:18.500
The others and I have been talking.

01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:22.282
Ahkmenrah's place
is here with his family.

01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:23.801
He must remain here.

01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:27.460
And the tablet should
stay here as well, son.

01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:30.604
This is where it belongs, Gigantor.

01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:32.445
Yeah, but it...

01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:35.260
That means you guys would have to stay.

01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:36.780
We belong in New York.

01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:41.620
Yeah, but if you...

01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:43.809
If you guys go, then you...

01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:46.449
you won't be alive after tonight.

01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:48.460
We're museum exhibits, Laredo.

01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:49.841
It's what we are.

01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:54.483
Folks come to look at us,
maybe learn a little something.

01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:56.684
That's alive, man.

01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:58.380
But I'm...

01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:00.140
I'm supposed to take care of you guys.

01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:01.680
And you have.

01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:04.444
It's okay, Lawrence.

01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:06.326
We're ready.

01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:10.525
I'm not.

01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:14.485
Let us go, son.

01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:21.967
Okay.

01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:28.409
Thank you for giving me
back my family, Larry...

01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:33.049
Guardian of Brooklyn.

01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:37.420
Dad, if we leave right now,
we can still catch a flight...

01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:40.060
get home with everyone still awake
before the sun comes up.

01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:41.725
Yeah, okay.

01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:45.049
Let's go home.

01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:46.780
Whoa!

01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:48.100
It's all right, Larry.

01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:50.100
We've reached something
of an understanding.

01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:52.721
- Really?
- Trixey, sit.

01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:55.380
Wow! That's really good.

01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:56.900
Good job, Lance.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:58.247
Thanks.

01:20:01.400 --> 01:20:02.886
Trixey, behave.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:04.247
Good girl.

01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:06.921
Steady.

01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:11.380
He never even listens to me.

01:20:11.480 --> 01:20:12.820
But you...

01:20:12.920 --> 01:20:16.100
I just feel like
you really listen to me.

01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:21.610
It's like our hearts are in
perfect sync with each other right now.

01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:23.660
Do you feel what...

01:20:23.772 --> 01:20:26.524
Hi. Sorry to interrupt whatever...

01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:28.700
is happening.

01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:31.765
Laaa, the guys are waiting outside.
We gotta go. Come on.

01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:34.500
What? No.

01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:36.060
No! Laaa, stay!

01:20:36.160 --> 01:20:37.980
I know this sounds crazy...

01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:40.601
but you and I could make a life
together here in England.

01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:51.281
Whoa!

01:20:51.920 --> 01:20:54.521
Wow. Okay.

01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:09.004
I will never forget you.

01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:16.648
You are the most rugged man
that I have ever, ever met.

01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:23.740
Keep the scrunchies.

01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:26.486
Okay, Laaa. We gotta go.

01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:28.041
Come on.

01:21:31.480 --> 01:21:33.091
I won't say anything if you won't.

01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:38.208
Oh, I know you hate this job and
everything, but tomorrow night...

01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:40.889
best job ever.

01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:24.940
Sure is quiet around here.

01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:28.449
Without the tablet,
it's just like any other museum.

01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:31.807
You know what I'm gonna remember
most about you?

01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:33.400
What?

01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:36.248
How big you guys are.

01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:41.566
Come here.

01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:43.241
Come here.

01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:45.684
Hold me.

01:22:51.720 --> 01:22:53.410
My...

01:22:55.760 --> 01:22:57.450
friend.

01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:02.684
You speak English?

01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:08.525
Okay.

01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:13.770
Hey, listen.

01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:18.444
Up there on the roof, when...

01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:20.771
When you almost...

01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:23.170
Yeah.

01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:32.260
I just want you to know...

01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:35.540
I really changed my perspective
on everything.

01:23:35.640 --> 01:23:37.683
I know we have a weird...

01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:42.681
We have this dynamic,
we have this tension.

01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:45.420
Back and forth.

01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:47.529
I mean, games, right? You know?

01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:51.961
Roles that we put ourselves into,
but why does it have to be that way?

01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:53.660
I feel like there's always been a mutual

01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:56.645
sort of respect for each other.

01:23:58.360 --> 01:23:59.891
Anyway.

01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:02.209
I'll miss you, you know?

01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:06.700
Okay. It's all right.

01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:08.889
Go ahead. One last slap.

01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:28.923
Yeah, I felt that was there
for a long time, too.

01:24:52.920 --> 01:24:54.201
Thank you.

01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:01.580
Who would have ever thought?

01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:04.804
I'm wax, she's polyurethane.

01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:07.122
But somehow, it worked.

01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:13.580
I guess this is it.

01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:14.940
Indeed.

01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:18.403
And I know young Nick
will do great things.

01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:20.285
Yeah, he's...

01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:24.180
ready to take on the world
all by himself.

01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:26.403
Then you've done your job.

01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:30.163
You've done your job.

01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:33.688
It's time for your next adventure.

01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:36.483
I have no idea
what I'm gonna do tomorrow.

01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:39.082
How exciting.

01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:48.125
Bye, Teddy.

01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:50.449
Farewell, Lawrence.

01:25:57.240 --> 01:25:58.500
Bully!

01:25:59.575 --> 01:26:00.609
Got you!

01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:03.963
Smile, my boy.

01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:07.289
It's sunrise.

01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:31.380
- Hey.
- Hey. You good?

01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:34.047
- Yeah, I am.
- Good.

01:26:36.520 --> 01:26:38.961
So, Ibiza?

01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:42.041
Yeah.

01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:44.410
The whole DJ thing, Dad...

01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:47.500
I don't know if that's
the thing for me...

01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:49.700
I just know that it's the next thing.

01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:51.620
After that, maybe college.

01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:55.481
I'm figuring it all out, you know?

01:26:56.800 --> 01:26:58.161
Sounds like a plan.

01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:02.540
I should get back to Mom's,
or something.

01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:04.171
Okay.

01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:06.721
I love you.

01:27:07.320 --> 01:27:09.010
I love you, too.

01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:10.681
All right.

01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:15.540
I'm not gonna let you go.

01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:18.002
Okay. I'll see you later.

01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:01.580
Three years, no Larry Daley.

01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:05.260
He was the one that took the fall
for me, got me my job back.

01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:09.260
I heard he went back to school,
got his degree, became a teacher.

01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:10.420
I'm very glad.

01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:13.540
Well, when he heard about
this traveling exhibition...

01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:16.923
Larry insisted that I deliver this
to you personally.

01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:23.020
The infamous,
supposedly magic, glowing tablet.

01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:25.460
Larry Daley and his fanciful tales.

01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:27.524
Larry said you could be trusted.

01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:29.605
What do you mean?

01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:34.765
With the top secret knowledge.

01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:36.921
What are you doing?

01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:39.020
- I'm winking.
- You're blinking.

01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:41.020
No, I wink with both eyes.

01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:42.180
That's blinking.

01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:44.380
It doesn't matter, because right now...

01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:45.980
you better get ready!

01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:47.486
For what?

01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:50.601
For this.

01:28:59.160 --> 01:29:00.361
It does glow.

01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:11.527
Come on.

01:29:58.240 --> 01:29:59.460
Sorry.

01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:01.140
Go ahead.

01:30:01.240 --> 01:30:02.885
Have fun-fun, Dum Dum.

01:30:42.960 --> 01:30:44.100
Stay!

01:30:44.200 --> 01:30:45.890
I'm not going anywhere.

01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:47.340
Stay!

01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:49.085
I'm not going anywhere!
