WEBVTT

00:02.236 --> 00:05.037
The Sad Lady Book Club
is reading

00:05.039 --> 00:08.841
<i>Fifty Shades of Grey</i> again.

00:08.843 --> 00:14.013
There's not a dry seat
in the house.

00:14.015 --> 00:16.949
If those ladies
are that into light torture,

00:16.951 --> 00:20.219
they should just apply
for our jobs.

00:20.221 --> 00:21.820
[bell dings]
- Hey.

00:21.822 --> 00:24.656
Aww, you two are so adorable.

00:24.658 --> 00:29.561
Like Romeo and Juliet,
but without the bright future.

00:29.563 --> 00:31.363
Yeah...

00:31.365 --> 00:33.699
I want him out of the diner.

00:33.701 --> 00:34.800
What are you talking about?

00:34.802 --> 00:36.368
Anyone who works
in this diner

00:36.370 --> 00:38.037
is like a fat guy
in a smart car.

00:38.039 --> 00:40.372
You can never get out.

00:40.374 --> 00:41.807
It's true.

00:41.809 --> 00:45.411
I came in here in 1962
for a cup of coffee.

00:45.413 --> 00:49.848
Someone asked me to break
a dollar, and I never left.

00:49.850 --> 00:52.818
Look. Living, working,
and sleeping with the same guy

00:52.820 --> 00:54.887
is never a good idea.

00:54.889 --> 00:57.990
Just talk to Hillary Clinton.

00:57.992 --> 00:59.858
I guess I can get
a dishwasher fired.

00:59.860 --> 01:04.063
When I was rich, I got Wolfgang
Puck fired from Wolfgang Puck.

01:04.065 --> 01:05.831
Get yours, Max!

01:05.833 --> 01:08.834
Hit it then quit it.

01:08.836 --> 01:13.272
That strategy served me well
in my 20s and 30s.

01:13.274 --> 01:17.409
Evening, ladies.

01:17.411 --> 01:20.779
Also, my 70s.

01:20.781 --> 01:22.948
(Peter Bjorn and John)
¶ Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh ¶

01:22.950 --> 01:24.783
[cash register bell dings]

01:24.785 --> 01:28.454
¶ Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh
Ooh Ooh ¶

01:34.128 --> 01:35.127
[bell dinging]
- Pick up.

01:35.129 --> 01:36.128
Or don't.

01:36.130 --> 01:38.130
Who gives a crap?

01:38.132 --> 01:40.966
Well, someone's in a bad mood.
What's wrong, Oleg?

01:40.968 --> 01:44.937
Did they discontinue
making Axe body spray?

01:44.939 --> 01:48.040
Don't even kid.

01:48.042 --> 01:50.909
No. I'm cranky because
I'm not having sex right now.

01:50.911 --> 01:52.978
Yeah. I thought it was weird
seeing both your hands

01:52.980 --> 01:55.447
while you were talking.

01:55.449 --> 01:58.217
Sophie's idea.
It's some old Polish ritual.

01:58.219 --> 02:00.285
The bride and groom
remain chaste for 30 days

02:00.287 --> 02:02.488
before the wedding.

02:02.490 --> 02:04.256
Apparently, the "something blue"
at the wedding

02:04.258 --> 02:07.926
has got to be my balls.

02:07.928 --> 02:09.294
So, you're practicing
celibacy.

02:09.296 --> 02:11.930
I'm trying,
but there are women everywhere.

02:11.932 --> 02:16.435
I feel like
a bull in a vagina shop.

02:16.437 --> 02:18.237
Hear ye, hear ye!

02:18.239 --> 02:21.306
I'm unveiling a major
improvement to the diner!

02:21.308 --> 02:24.076
Well, we'll miss you, Han.

02:24.078 --> 02:26.912
Nice try, Max,
but like Ryan Seacrest,

02:26.914 --> 02:30.282
I'll be here forever.

02:30.284 --> 02:32.951
Now, will you all please do what
you have yet to do on Twitter

02:32.953 --> 02:35.954
and follow me?

02:35.956 --> 02:37.322
You too, Earl.

02:37.324 --> 02:38.757
Hell, this better be good.

02:38.759 --> 02:41.093
Every step I take
could be my last.

02:45.766 --> 02:46.765
And now...

02:46.767 --> 02:48.600
Without further a-douche...

02:48.602 --> 02:50.969
Ready to have your minds blown?

02:50.971 --> 02:55.140
At this point, I'm ready
to have anything blown.

02:55.142 --> 02:57.142
Ta-da!

02:57.144 --> 02:59.645
That is the worst gift
I ever received

02:59.647 --> 03:02.014
and last year,
my son bought me a coffin.

03:06.020 --> 03:08.387
This works our great then,
because it's not for you.

03:08.389 --> 03:10.122
It's for Nash.

03:10.124 --> 03:12.291
Oh, well, that's real nice.

03:12.293 --> 03:15.627
Because the shower at Max's
place doesn't work at all.

03:15.629 --> 03:17.362
You better believe it's nice.

03:17.364 --> 03:19.631
That's the Spritzy 5000.

03:19.633 --> 03:23.569
<i>Dishwasher Weekly</i> gave it
four out of four Dishies.

03:23.571 --> 03:26.638
You know our oven doesn't work,
right?

03:26.640 --> 03:30.976
Hey, boss lady, if we work hard,
do we get a gift?

03:30.978 --> 03:33.312
If you work hard,
I'll die childless

03:33.314 --> 03:35.881
with my mouth frozen open
in shock.

03:35.883 --> 03:38.183
Yeah, I went there!

03:38.185 --> 03:43.188
Nash works hard, so only he may
handle my beautiful hose!

03:43.190 --> 03:44.890
Well, if he's handling
Han's hose,

03:44.892 --> 03:47.526
he's never getting fired.

03:47.528 --> 03:48.994
Okay. Step up here, Nash.

03:48.996 --> 03:51.096
I'll show you
what this puppy can do.

03:55.202 --> 03:59.271
So far the puppy can't reach
the hose.

03:59.273 --> 04:01.240
A little help.

04:04.511 --> 04:07.980
Aww, there's nothing cuter
than a hot guy holding a baby.

04:10.851 --> 04:14.620
Now just grab that thing
and squeeze it till it sprays.

04:14.622 --> 04:18.023
Move to call a moratorium
on the words "grab," "squeeze,"

04:18.025 --> 04:20.092
and "sprays" till the wedding.

04:28.569 --> 04:31.236
Damn!
That's hot.

04:31.238 --> 04:34.940
And me without any singles
to stuff down his pants.

04:34.942 --> 04:37.976
Well, I better go dry off
in the men's room.

04:37.978 --> 04:39.945
Don't be too long
in that stall.

04:39.947 --> 04:42.381
I've got a date with the Land
O'Lakes butter package lady

04:42.383 --> 04:43.682
on my next break.

04:48.222 --> 04:49.454
[all gasping]

04:52.059 --> 04:55.160
Oh. Pardon me, ladies.
I'm all wet.

04:55.162 --> 04:57.763
[all gasping]

04:57.765 --> 05:00.132
Max? Are you seeing
what I'm seeing?

05:00.134 --> 05:02.301
Those ladies looking at him
like he's a senior special

05:02.303 --> 05:05.337
at Sizzler's?

05:05.339 --> 05:06.838
[all speaking at once]

05:06.840 --> 05:08.273
We might not be able
to get Nash fired,

05:08.275 --> 05:11.109
but we can get him hired
as a fashion model.

05:11.111 --> 05:12.577
Look at their faces.

05:12.579 --> 05:15.480
He could be the future bulge
of Calvin Klein.

05:15.482 --> 05:17.449
Now you're talking
about the future?

05:17.451 --> 05:19.584
Why can't you just accept
that we are stuck

05:19.586 --> 05:21.953
with a really crappy present?

05:21.955 --> 05:24.589
Quit trash-talking
the Spritzy 5000!

05:30.864 --> 05:33.131
Good afternoon.
Welcome to The High.

05:33.133 --> 05:34.933
I'll have somebody
get you some water.

05:34.935 --> 05:37.536
Not me,
'cause I'm past that.

05:37.538 --> 05:39.805
You know, here.

05:39.807 --> 05:41.940
I think I just sat another one
of those lesbian blind-dates

05:41.942 --> 05:43.508
for our boss.

05:43.510 --> 05:46.178
It's hard out there
for a pimp.

05:46.180 --> 05:48.547
Why do you think
I got out of pimping?

05:48.549 --> 05:51.149
That and someone broke
a beer bottle over my head.

05:51.151 --> 05:53.151
So, did you get Nash a modeling
job yet?

05:53.153 --> 05:54.553
I'm working on it.

05:54.555 --> 05:57.289
It's not like I can
just call Tyra Banks.

05:57.291 --> 06:00.292
Well, that's what her people
said when I called.

06:00.294 --> 06:03.462
Ugh, phone therapy ran long.

06:03.464 --> 06:06.131
Apparently I have more issues
than I realized

06:06.133 --> 06:09.801
about Rosie leaving<i> The View.</i>

06:09.803 --> 06:12.304
Are my dates here yet?

06:12.306 --> 06:15.073
Please don't
tell me it's her, her, or her.

06:15.075 --> 06:18.377
It's her, her, and her.

06:18.379 --> 06:20.212
Lose them.

06:20.214 --> 06:22.247
How am I supposed to
get rid of them?

06:22.249 --> 06:24.082
Just say what anyone says when
they want a lesbian to leave,

06:24.084 --> 06:28.253
"There's a Subaru outside
that's about to get a ticket."

06:28.255 --> 06:29.721
If you had you told me,
ten years ago,

06:29.723 --> 06:33.925
I'd be on a dating site
called "Lez Meet Up,"

06:33.927 --> 06:37.028
I would've told the youth pastor
I was married to,

06:37.030 --> 06:41.600
"You've lost your mind."

06:41.602 --> 06:42.701
[phone beeps]

06:42.703 --> 06:43.835
[gasps]

06:43.837 --> 06:45.103
Oh, I just got some interest

06:45.105 --> 06:47.172
from the
Del Monico Modeling Agency.

06:47.174 --> 06:49.107
But for the interview,
he needs photos.

06:49.109 --> 06:51.877
And not just the pictures
of his butt on your phone.

06:51.879 --> 06:53.879
Fine, you handle it.

06:53.881 --> 06:55.447
The only thing I know
about modeling is

06:55.449 --> 06:58.917
a couple of years ago, I was
the face of shingles on WebMD.

07:04.858 --> 07:07.959
Girls, perfect timing to ask me
to do this photo shoot.

07:07.961 --> 07:11.229
The FBI just gave me
my camera back last week.

07:11.231 --> 07:13.532
Oh, so you get your camera back,

07:13.534 --> 07:15.133
but I'm still waiting
on that kilo of coke

07:15.135 --> 07:19.805
that I spent hours carefully
filling my butt with?

07:19.807 --> 07:21.640
Let me just change the settings.

07:21.642 --> 07:27.279
This camera is used to taking
pictures from 800 feet away.

07:27.281 --> 07:30.382
And we want those pictures back,
Oleg!

07:30.384 --> 07:32.584
Hey, everybody!

07:32.586 --> 07:34.052
Just call me
"rush hour traffic"

07:34.054 --> 07:38.256
'cause I sure am horny.

07:38.258 --> 07:42.327
Oh, Caroline, I do not know how
you go years, and years,

07:42.329 --> 07:45.597
and years, and years,
and years, and years

07:45.599 --> 07:48.967
without doing the nasty.

07:48.969 --> 07:51.970
It's only been years and years.

07:51.972 --> 07:54.172
- Come on.
- And years.

07:54.174 --> 07:56.274
Well, I could go
for a brisket sandwich.

07:56.276 --> 07:57.943
We're closed, Sophie.

07:57.945 --> 08:01.313
I know.
I got one in my purse.

08:01.315 --> 08:05.150
And why are you doing the photo
shoot in this skanky dishroom?

08:05.152 --> 08:08.487
Because we're going with
the "hot dishwasher" angle.

08:08.489 --> 08:10.655
The agency said
every model needs a hook.

08:10.657 --> 08:12.657
Yeah, like how Cindy Crawford
has a beauty mark

08:12.659 --> 08:15.126
and Anna Nicole Smith
is dead.

08:15.128 --> 08:19.531
Yeah, yeah. My sister is a model
in Poland and she has a hook.

08:19.533 --> 08:24.336
It's her left hand, yeah.
It's is also great for kabobs.

08:24.338 --> 08:25.937
Come on, Nash!

08:25.939 --> 08:27.939
Put a little Irish Spring
in your step.

08:27.941 --> 08:29.674
I'm a little nervous.

08:29.676 --> 08:32.310
The only other time I had
my picture taken was at school.

08:32.312 --> 08:37.015
The priest said he needed a
shirtless one for the roll call.

08:37.017 --> 08:41.019
Where did he go to school,
Our Lady of<i> To Catch a Predator?</i>

08:41.021 --> 08:44.890
Wow. You sure look hot.

08:44.892 --> 08:45.957
Careful, Sophie.

08:45.959 --> 08:47.959
That's my brisket.

08:47.961 --> 08:50.896
I'm not talking about
Daniel Day-Loser here.

08:50.898 --> 08:55.367
I'm talking about Oleg.

08:55.369 --> 09:00.138
You are sweating
like an old knockwurst

09:00.140 --> 09:05.010
that has been left out
in the sun.

09:05.012 --> 09:09.481
It's really breathtaking.

09:09.483 --> 09:13.251
Okay, Nash, stand over here
near the hose

09:13.253 --> 09:15.887
and give me hot face,
dead eyes.

09:15.889 --> 09:18.023
You know, like me
when I mix NyQuil and DayQuil.

09:18.025 --> 09:20.325
I call it
AfternoonQuil.

09:20.327 --> 09:22.027
Okay. Now I'm gonna start
shooting.

09:22.029 --> 09:26.264
Yeah. Shoot, baby!
Shoot!

09:26.266 --> 09:27.599
- What do you think?
[camera clicking]

09:27.601 --> 09:30.435
Well, he's stiff,
but not in the good way.

09:30.437 --> 09:32.037
Ugh, this is painful.

09:32.039 --> 09:35.273
He's like Susan Boyle
without the star quality.

09:35.275 --> 09:37.342
We need a little of what
he had the other day.

09:37.344 --> 09:39.377
You'll thank me for this later.

09:39.379 --> 09:42.047
[camera clicking]

09:42.049 --> 09:43.281
Yes, Nash, yes!

09:43.283 --> 09:47.552
Tear your shirt!

09:47.554 --> 09:51.256
- Yeah, yeah.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

09:53.293 --> 09:54.292
[gasps]

09:54.294 --> 09:58.363
Stop!

09:58.365 --> 10:01.132
What the hell is happening
in here?

10:01.134 --> 10:03.368
I didn't give anyone permission
to use my diner

10:03.370 --> 10:04.469
for a photo shoot.

10:04.471 --> 10:05.904
Calm down.

10:05.906 --> 10:07.906
We are trying to get him
a modeling job.

10:07.908 --> 10:10.775
He has a job!
He's my number one worker.

10:10.777 --> 10:13.311
Like the doctor said to your
mother when you were born,

10:13.313 --> 10:15.213
tough break.

10:15.215 --> 10:17.449
You two crows
don't let me have anything!

10:23.156 --> 10:25.323
Okay, Nash,
part of the model audish

10:25.325 --> 10:27.926
is to see how you'd be
as a performer in commercials,

10:27.928 --> 10:30.395
and movies, and other things
people don't watch anymore.

10:30.397 --> 10:32.497
Now, obviously,
right out of the gate,

10:32.499 --> 10:35.467
you're not gonna be as good
as that duck who says "Aflac,"

10:35.469 --> 10:38.937
but you've got to be at least
as good as Ben Affleck.

10:38.939 --> 10:41.506
I can help. For a time,
I had a rich acting career.

10:41.508 --> 10:43.608
It started with a starring role
in<i> Annie,</i>

10:43.610 --> 10:45.310
and ended when I portrayed
Rosa Parks

10:45.312 --> 10:46.611
in an ill-advised high school
production

10:46.613 --> 10:49.447
that led to an investigation
by the NAACP.

10:49.449 --> 10:53.118
Ooh, this is a commercial
for breakfast cereal!

10:53.120 --> 10:56.021
Ah! Every actor's dream!

10:56.023 --> 10:57.322
Hey, Nash, read this.

10:57.324 --> 10:58.923
Think James Dean.

10:58.925 --> 11:03.261
But alive
and eating Cocoa Puffs.

11:03.263 --> 11:05.096
"Cocoa Puffs
are a delicious part

11:05.098 --> 11:09.501
of any well-balanced breakfast."

11:09.503 --> 11:10.935
I'm trying to find
a nice way to say--

11:10.937 --> 11:14.939
You suck, bro.

11:14.941 --> 11:16.675
You--you get it.

11:16.677 --> 11:19.010
You know the thrill
of eating chocolate

11:19.012 --> 11:22.213
at a traditionally
non-chocolatey time of day.

11:22.215 --> 11:24.683
Let's tap into that.

11:24.685 --> 11:26.051
Okay. Take it from the top.

11:26.053 --> 11:28.620
And this time, go cuckoo.

11:28.622 --> 11:31.956
Go cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.

11:31.958 --> 11:33.291
"Cocoa Puffs are a delicious--"

11:33.293 --> 11:35.326
Stop.

11:35.328 --> 11:38.863
Don't phone this in.
It's not Raisin Bran.

11:38.865 --> 11:40.465
"Pocoa Cuffs are a delicious--"

11:40.467 --> 11:42.333
"Pocoa Cuffs"?

11:42.335 --> 11:45.470
Pocoa Cuffs?

11:45.472 --> 11:48.907
I just can't with these
rank amateurs, Caroline.

11:48.909 --> 11:50.542
Max, calm down.

11:50.544 --> 11:52.510
It's a fake tryout
for a cereal commercial,

11:52.512 --> 11:55.513
not<i> Dance Moms.</i>

11:55.515 --> 11:58.416
I'm nervous.
I'm not an actor.

11:58.418 --> 12:00.351
Uh, no, you are not.

12:00.353 --> 12:02.520
Give me that.

12:02.522 --> 12:04.422
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

12:04.424 --> 12:08.259
Got it.

12:08.261 --> 12:11.596
Cocoa Puffs are a delicious part
of any well-balanced breakfast!

12:11.598 --> 12:13.398
They're good for you,
which parents love,

12:13.400 --> 12:15.567
and they taste like candy,
which I love!

12:15.569 --> 12:18.570
I can't help it!
I'm cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs!

12:18.572 --> 12:22.073
Cuckoo!

12:22.075 --> 12:27.078
I'm tearing up, and it's not
just the black mold in here.

12:27.080 --> 12:30.582
Max, I think you may have just
set the acting bar too high.

12:30.584 --> 12:31.950
[knock at door]
- Oh.

12:31.952 --> 12:35.386
I've never set a bar
too high before.

12:35.388 --> 12:38.857
I've set a bar on fire
and I've left a bar too high.

12:38.859 --> 12:40.625
Oh, hey, girls.

12:40.627 --> 12:43.394
Oh, do you mind if I hang
down here with you for a while?

12:43.396 --> 12:46.297
Oleg is up there,
he's trying to seduce me

12:46.299 --> 12:47.632
by cleaning the apartment.

12:47.634 --> 12:51.770
And it's, oh, oh, so dirty.

12:51.772 --> 12:53.705
[vacuum cleaner humming]

12:53.707 --> 12:58.476
Oh, oh, he's vacuuming now,
which means he's naked.

12:58.478 --> 13:03.114
Oh, me and my Polish values.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.949
Polish Values?

13:04.951 --> 13:07.619
That's the name of my favorite
dollar store in Brooklyn.

13:07.621 --> 13:08.553
[vacuum humming]

13:08.555 --> 13:13.591
Oh, he's deep-cleaning the shag.

13:13.593 --> 13:15.493
Oh, my God.
Somebody, do something

13:15.495 --> 13:17.796
to make me not want sex.

13:17.798 --> 13:20.565
All right, Nash, why don't you
show us your runway walk?

13:24.571 --> 13:26.004
That was it.

13:26.006 --> 13:29.307
Oh, I thought you were going
to pick up a pen.

13:29.309 --> 13:31.109
Thanks, perfect.

13:31.111 --> 13:35.580
Now I'm completely turned off.

13:35.582 --> 13:39.584
Watching that potato walk across
the room really did the trick.

13:39.586 --> 13:41.586
Nash, concentrate.

13:41.588 --> 13:42.687
Follow my lead.

13:42.689 --> 13:44.189
Bam. Pow. Bam. Pow.

13:44.191 --> 13:46.324
And step and bam,
and step and pow,

13:46.326 --> 13:48.359
and step and bam!

13:48.361 --> 13:50.628
Oh, even better!

13:50.630 --> 13:54.032
I mean, after that,
they could film the sequel

13:54.034 --> 13:56.835
to<i> Frozen</i> on my lady parts.

14:00.674 --> 14:02.640
Yeah, me too.

14:02.642 --> 14:06.044
But just 'cause I
"Let It Go" down there.

14:06.046 --> 14:09.781
[vacuum hum continues]
- Aaah!

14:09.783 --> 14:13.952
Oh, now he's using
the wand attachment.

14:13.954 --> 14:18.723
Oh, and he's getting real deep
between the cushions.

14:18.725 --> 14:20.892
Oh, my God, just screw it.

14:20.894 --> 14:23.728
I'm never gonna make it
to the wedding!

14:23.730 --> 14:26.564
[groaning]

14:26.566 --> 14:28.666
Oh, Grandma Kuchenski,
please forgive me

14:28.668 --> 14:29.868
for what I'm about to do.

14:29.870 --> 14:32.370
I--

14:32.372 --> 14:34.639
Well, you were no White Lily
yourself!

14:41.248 --> 14:43.815
[gasps]
- Wow.

14:43.817 --> 14:46.517
He's bamming and powing
up a storm.

14:46.519 --> 14:48.753
When he's famous,
I hope he remembers us.

14:48.755 --> 14:52.824
Pfft. I like to think I did some
things he will never forget.

14:52.826 --> 14:54.692
How's that?

14:54.694 --> 14:56.394
Great, you can walk.

14:56.396 --> 15:00.398
If you can read too, I'll treat
myself to a Snapple.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.666
Let's get to the copy.

15:01.668 --> 15:03.234
Actually, we came prepared.

15:03.236 --> 15:05.503
Nash rehearsed
the Cocoa Puffs commercial.

15:05.505 --> 15:07.205
I think you'll be quite moved.

15:07.207 --> 15:08.773
Oh yeah, well,
we'll be reading something

15:08.775 --> 15:10.275
a little different today.

15:10.277 --> 15:12.610
[clears throat]

15:12.612 --> 15:14.712
Don't panic.
They do this all the time.

15:14.714 --> 15:16.047
They want to make sure
you're flexible.

15:16.049 --> 15:17.615
Yeah. Go ahead, Nash.

15:17.617 --> 15:20.785
Whatever cereal it is,
act like it's delicious.

15:20.787 --> 15:24.222
Unless it's Rice Krispies.
A-boring!

15:24.224 --> 15:26.691
Okay, here goes.

15:26.693 --> 15:27.692
"You know you like it.

15:27.694 --> 15:30.862
Bend over, bitch."

15:30.864 --> 15:34.432
Uh, are we missing a page?

15:34.434 --> 15:37.635
Cereals have changed
since I was a kid.

15:37.637 --> 15:39.237
Should I read the part
where I notice

15:39.239 --> 15:40.705
the teacher's not wearing
any panties?

15:40.707 --> 15:42.807
Oh, my God.
This is porn!

15:42.809 --> 15:45.076
No wonder all those people
out there were freaks.

15:45.078 --> 15:49.480
No wonder I recognized
so many of them.

15:49.482 --> 15:50.882
Don't act so surprised.

15:50.884 --> 15:55.586
Everyone knows Cocoa Puffs
is code for porn.

15:55.588 --> 15:57.789
Also, you sent us some pictures
taken by someone

15:57.791 --> 16:01.659
very experienced in erotica.

16:01.661 --> 16:03.962
We can't let him
do this.

16:03.964 --> 16:05.897
I have a movie that starts
shooting tomorrow

16:05.899 --> 16:08.599
that pays $1,000 a day.

16:08.601 --> 16:10.735
Can we?

16:10.737 --> 16:12.503
Maybe we can't.

16:12.505 --> 16:14.872
It's the lead in<i> Sorest Rump.</i>

16:19.679 --> 16:22.780
Maybe we can.

16:22.782 --> 16:25.316
I think we need
a little sidebar, Delores.

16:25.318 --> 16:26.617
- [clears throat]
- Should I come with you?

16:26.619 --> 16:27.952
No, we're good.

16:27.954 --> 16:29.988
I have a couple of questions
for the actor.

16:29.990 --> 16:34.192
Can you swim,
and are you circumcised?

16:34.194 --> 16:35.827
Max, this has gone too far.

16:35.829 --> 16:37.462
I know, I was expecting you
to just crash with me

16:37.464 --> 16:41.466
for a couple of days
and get your own place.

16:41.468 --> 16:43.835
Are we really gonna
let Nash do porn

16:43.837 --> 16:45.837
just so he doesn't work
at the diner?

16:45.839 --> 16:47.839
Hey, ladies,
what's it gonna be?

16:47.841 --> 16:49.807
I got other talent to see.

16:49.809 --> 16:52.343
I got a guy named Lustin Beaver

16:52.345 --> 16:54.612
taking the Amtrak
in from Philly.

16:57.784 --> 17:00.952
Max, if you're really keen on me
being a porn actor,

17:00.954 --> 17:02.220
I'll do it.

17:02.222 --> 17:03.955
She says, tomorrow,
they start filming

17:03.957 --> 17:07.725
<i>The Grand Booty Fest Hotel.</i>

17:07.727 --> 17:10.161
And, they'll pay me more
for my accent.

17:10.163 --> 17:15.500
Also, what does "gay for pay"
mean?

17:15.502 --> 17:18.603
Ugh, I guess it means
we got to go.

17:24.878 --> 17:26.677
Look at him, Max.

17:26.679 --> 17:29.881
A cute guy, eaten up
and spat out by show business

17:29.883 --> 17:33.918
like so many
Baldwin brothers before him.

17:33.920 --> 17:35.987
Nash doesn't care
about modeling.

17:35.989 --> 17:37.922
He's 21.
He doesn't care about anything.

17:37.924 --> 17:41.092
His biggest concern
is playing with the XBox.

17:41.094 --> 17:44.095
Mine and, also,
the popular video game system.

17:44.097 --> 17:45.496
He cares about you.

17:45.498 --> 17:47.899
He was willing to do
"gay for pay."

17:47.901 --> 17:52.770
Did I hear Nash
is going "gay for pay"?

17:52.772 --> 17:56.707
'Cause I've got $4
burning a hole in my pocket.

17:56.709 --> 17:58.509
Oh, a customer.

17:58.511 --> 18:00.845
Hi, welcome to The High.
Here for dessert?

18:00.847 --> 18:04.015
Oh, thanks but I haven't
had cake since my Sweet 16,

18:04.017 --> 18:07.385
and even then,
I made myself throw it up.

18:07.387 --> 18:10.288
I'm meeting someone here
and my phone's about to die.

18:10.290 --> 18:13.024
And if it dies, I will too.
Do you have an outlet?

18:13.026 --> 18:14.792
Screaming in the shower
really works for me.

18:14.794 --> 18:17.728
Like, right into the water.

18:17.730 --> 18:20.298
Super cute.
But I do need a phone outlet.

18:20.300 --> 18:21.933
I'll plug you in, honey,

18:21.935 --> 18:25.269
and I'll take care of your
phone, too.

18:25.271 --> 18:27.305
Girls, meet Marie.

18:27.307 --> 18:29.740
Hi.
Seriously, down to 10%.

18:29.742 --> 18:32.210
Oh, did you two meet
on "Lez Meet Up"?

18:32.212 --> 18:36.047
No, honey, I've never been
on "Lez Meet Up."

18:36.049 --> 18:38.816
Oh, you're thinking of me,
Caroline.

18:38.818 --> 18:41.819
You know how much
I love lady tail.

18:41.821 --> 18:44.055
This place is amazing.

18:44.057 --> 18:46.290
Isn't it amazing?

18:46.292 --> 18:49.060
I had the decorator redo it
nine times.

18:49.062 --> 18:51.562
You can feel his anger
in the walls.

18:51.564 --> 18:52.964
It's electric.

18:52.966 --> 18:56.134
We're electric.
Who is this miracle?

18:56.136 --> 18:58.169
That's Nash.
I found him in the Bowery

18:58.171 --> 19:01.005
next to a pile
of burning trash.

19:01.007 --> 19:02.974
Go say hi.

19:02.976 --> 19:06.744
He's even creamier and more
delicious up close.

19:06.746 --> 19:08.746
You're eating?
That is so punk rock.

19:08.748 --> 19:11.115
Tell me everything right now.

19:11.117 --> 19:12.917
Uh, well, I'm a dishwasher.

19:12.919 --> 19:15.319
I'm from Ireland.

19:15.321 --> 19:16.787
Oh, I was trying
to become a model

19:16.789 --> 19:19.123
and I almost did porn
an hour ago.

19:19.125 --> 19:21.526
That is the best story
I ever heard.

19:21.528 --> 19:22.793
Tell it to me again standing up.

19:22.795 --> 19:26.164
But this time, don't talk.

19:26.166 --> 19:29.000
I see face, I see ass,
I see model.

19:29.002 --> 19:30.768
Do you have a manager?

19:30.770 --> 19:33.437
I guess that'd be Caroline,
the blonde one over there.

19:33.439 --> 19:37.108
Blonde one, come over here and
talk to me about your client.

19:37.110 --> 19:39.610
I am in love.
He's perfection.

19:39.612 --> 19:41.779
Marie Prower,
Senior VP of Marketing.

19:41.781 --> 19:43.147
Sweet, what company?

19:43.149 --> 19:44.182
Guess.

19:44.184 --> 19:46.384
Um, Tommy Hilfinger.

19:46.386 --> 19:48.986
I work for Guess, darling.

19:48.988 --> 19:51.289
No more words.
Listen.

19:51.291 --> 19:53.291
He's amazing.

19:53.293 --> 19:55.193
I would tweet about him
right now, but my phone is dead.

19:55.195 --> 19:57.795
So bring him into my office
on Monday.

19:57.797 --> 19:58.963
You heard her, Caroline.

19:58.965 --> 20:02.300
Bring him into her office
tomorrow.

20:02.302 --> 20:05.369
She's obsessed with me.

20:05.371 --> 20:08.206
Max, I was right.
He is a model.

20:08.208 --> 20:10.641
Get me a hot wife and a hotter
woman to cheat on her with,

20:10.643 --> 20:14.478
'cause I'm a big-time
talent manager.

20:14.480 --> 20:16.514
Congratulations, dude.

20:16.516 --> 20:19.050
Well, I guess if this works out,
I'm gonna have to quit my job

20:19.052 --> 20:20.685
at the diner.

20:20.687 --> 20:23.921
Will you be mad at me?

20:23.923 --> 20:26.591
I'll be really sad.

20:26.593 --> 20:28.693
I'm gonna miss you a lot,
you know?

20:28.695 --> 20:30.861
Not seeing you 24/7.

20:30.863 --> 20:33.431
But I would hate myself
if I didn't let you

20:33.433 --> 20:35.833
follow your dreams.

20:35.835 --> 20:40.438
Even if it means you moving out
of the apartment, too.

20:40.440 --> 20:44.075
Now go.

20:44.077 --> 20:45.943
Here comes that tear again.

20:45.945 --> 20:48.079
I'm all choked up.

20:48.081 --> 20:51.515
Max, you would have made a great
Rosa Parks.

20:51.517 --> 20:53.718
If you had been Black.

20:53.720 --> 20:58.189
Which, I guess,
is what they insist on.

20:58.191 --> 20:59.624
But you got him to move out.

20:59.626 --> 21:01.058
You are good.

21:01.060 --> 21:03.527
Yeah, well, I mean,
he's cute,

21:03.529 --> 21:09.400
but I'm not all that cuckoo
for his Cocoa Puffs.

21:09.402 --> 21:11.936
[cash register bell rings]
