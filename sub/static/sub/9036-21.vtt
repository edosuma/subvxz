WEBVTT

00:04.705 --> 00:07.141
- THERE YOU GO.
- THANKS.

00:07.175 --> 00:09.410
- RAY BARONE.
- DESMOND HOWARD.

00:09.443 --> 00:11.645
HI, HI.
THANKS FOR THE INTERVIEW.

00:11.679 --> 00:13.747
CONGRATULATIONS
ON THAT SUPER BOWL MVP THING.

00:13.781 --> 00:15.683
- THANKS,
I SAW YOUR ARTICLE ABOUT IT.

00:15.716 --> 00:18.586
THAT WAS GREAT.
- HUH, I WISH YOU WERE MY BOSS.

00:18.619 --> 00:20.154
- WHAT?
HE DIDN'T LIKE IT?

00:20.188 --> 00:21.722
- YEAH.

00:21.755 --> 00:24.192
- WELL, HOW'D YOU
HAND IT IN?

00:24.225 --> 00:26.260
- I MEAN,
I GAVE IT TO HIM.

00:26.294 --> 00:27.761
- THAT'S IT?
WHEN YOU DO A GOOD JOB,

00:27.795 --> 00:29.497
YOU'VE GOT TO LET THEM KNOW.

00:29.530 --> 00:32.733
WHEN I DO MY JOB WELL,
I LET EVERYBODY KNOW.

00:32.766 --> 00:35.103
I SLOW DOWN
AT THE FIVE-YARD LINE--

00:36.404 --> 00:37.605
I START DOING
A LITTLE ROBOT,

00:37.638 --> 00:39.173
SPIKE THE BALL,

00:39.207 --> 00:40.708
EVERYBODY'S
IN THE CROWD FEELING IT.

00:40.741 --> 00:42.376
- THAT'S SHOWBOATING.

00:42.410 --> 00:44.278
- NO, MAN,
THAT'S SHARING THE MOMENT.

00:44.312 --> 00:46.514
THAT'S LETTING THE PEOPLE KNOW
YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING SPECIAL.

00:46.547 --> 00:49.483
NOW, I'M YOUR BOSS.
GIVE ME YOUR ARTICLE.

00:51.585 --> 00:53.421
[scoffs]
MEAN IT THIS TIME.

00:53.454 --> 00:55.189
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:55.223 --> 00:57.791
- I MEAN,
SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT.

00:57.825 --> 01:00.094
- I DIDN'T COME WITH MUCH,
REALLY.

01:00.128 --> 01:02.062
- RAY, SHOW ME SOMETHING.

01:04.798 --> 01:10.504
[laughs hysterically]

01:10.538 --> 01:12.340
OR MAYBE YOU SHOULD JUST
HAND IT IN WITH A SMILE.

01:12.373 --> 01:14.074
- YEAH.
[laughs]

01:15.776 --> 01:16.844
HI, I'M RAY,

01:16.877 --> 01:18.112
AND I LIVE HERE
IN LONG ISLAND

01:18.146 --> 01:19.713
WITH MY WIFE, DEBRA.

01:19.747 --> 01:20.881
SHE'S GREAT
WITH THE KIDS,

01:20.914 --> 01:23.151
THE HOUSE,
EVERYTHING.

01:23.184 --> 01:25.253
OH, I DON'T KNOW
HOW SHE DOES IT.

01:25.286 --> 01:26.420
WE'VE GOT
A DAUGHTER, ALLY,

01:26.454 --> 01:30.158
AND TWIN
TWO-YEAR-OLD BOYS.

01:30.191 --> 01:32.493
IT'S NOT REALLY
ABOUT THE KIDS.

01:32.526 --> 01:35.663
MY PARENTS LIVE
ACROSS THE STREET.

01:35.696 --> 01:37.198
THAT'S RIGHT,

01:37.231 --> 01:39.900
AND MY BROTHER
LIVES WITH THEM.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.469
NOW, NOT EVERY FAMILY

01:41.502 --> 01:43.271
WOULD GO BY
ON A CONVEYER BELT FOR YOU,

01:43.304 --> 01:45.173
BUT MINE WOULD,
BECAUSE--

01:45.206 --> 01:47.441
- EVERYBODY
LOVES RAYMOND.

01:47.475 --> 01:49.210
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

01:56.884 --> 01:59.387
- HEY.

01:59.420 --> 02:00.388
MISS ME?

02:00.421 --> 02:02.723
- UH-HUH.

02:02.756 --> 02:05.493
[whispering]
I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU.

02:05.526 --> 02:07.495
- I'M NOT TALKING
TO YOU EITHER.

02:07.528 --> 02:09.397
- YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW,
IT'S JUST THAT SOMETIMES

02:09.430 --> 02:12.800
I FEEL LIKE THERE'S
NOT ENOUGH TIME.

02:12.833 --> 02:16.504
WELL, YEAH,
YOU'RE RIGHT, AS ALWAYS.

02:16.537 --> 02:17.638
YEAH.
OH, WELL, NO.

02:17.671 --> 02:19.540
THANK YOU
FOR BEING SO UNDERSTANDING.

02:19.573 --> 02:21.575
OKAY, BYE.

02:21.609 --> 02:23.477
- WHO WAS THAT?
- SHH.

02:25.246 --> 02:26.814
[on radio] YOU KNOW,
IT'S JUST THAT SOMETIMES

02:26.847 --> 02:28.382
I FEEL LIKE THERE'S
NOT ENOUGH TIME.

02:28.416 --> 02:29.583
- YOU'RE ON THE RADIO?

02:29.617 --> 02:31.885
- YOUR HUSBAND'S
NOT A MIND READER, DEBRA.

02:31.919 --> 02:32.886
- HUSBAND?

02:32.920 --> 02:34.455
- TELL HIM WHAT YOU NEED.

02:34.488 --> 02:35.456
- NEED?

02:35.489 --> 02:36.357
- YEAH, WELL, OH, NO.

02:36.390 --> 02:38.292
THANK YOU
FOR BEING SO UNDERSTANDING.

02:38.326 --> 02:39.693
- AND THANK YOU
FOR JOINING ME TODAY

02:39.727 --> 02:42.496
ON "IT'S YOUR PROBLEM."

02:42.530 --> 02:43.931
I'M DR. NORA SARAZIN.

02:43.964 --> 02:46.434
GOOD NIGHT,
AND REMEMBER,

02:46.467 --> 02:49.237
YOU'VE GOT NO ONE TO BLAME
BUT YOURSELF.

02:50.804 --> 02:51.839
- WHOO!

02:51.872 --> 02:53.574
MMM, HI, HONEY.

02:53.607 --> 02:56.210
- YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ME
TO SOME RADIO SHRINK?

02:56.244 --> 02:58.212
- RAY, SHE'S ONE OF THE MOST
RESPECTED PSYCHOTHERAPISTS

02:58.246 --> 02:59.213
IN THE COUNTRY.

02:59.247 --> 03:00.348
I WAS LUCKY
TO GET THROUGH.

03:00.381 --> 03:01.682
- WELL, WHAT DID YOU
SAY TO HER?

03:01.715 --> 03:02.850
- IT'S JUST THAT I CALLED

03:02.883 --> 03:04.385
BECAUSE SOME OTHER CALLER
WAS SAYING

03:04.418 --> 03:05.919
HOW SHE DIDN'T FEEL
APPRECIATED--

03:05.953 --> 03:09.690
SOME HOOKER
FROM DALLAS.

03:09.723 --> 03:10.991
- WAIT A MINUTE.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.660
SO YOU DON'T FEEL
APPRECIATED.

03:12.693 --> 03:13.927
- WELL, IT'S JUST
THAT WE DON'T GET TO SPEND

03:13.961 --> 03:15.696
A LOT OF TIME TOGETHER.

03:15.729 --> 03:18.332
AND DR. NORA SAYS THAT CAN LEAD
TO FEELING UNAPPRECIATED.

03:18.366 --> 03:20.568
- OH, WHAT THE HELL
IS SHE TALKING ABOUT?

03:20.601 --> 03:21.902
I APPRECIATE YOU.

03:21.935 --> 03:24.272
BY THE WAY,
THANKS FOR--

03:24.305 --> 03:25.273
EVERYTHING.

03:25.306 --> 03:26.507
- YEAH, YOU--

03:26.540 --> 03:30.444
[telephone rings]

03:30.478 --> 03:31.912
- HELLO.

03:31.945 --> 03:33.547
OH, YEAH, RIGHT HERE.

03:33.581 --> 03:34.648
IT'S DR. NORA.

03:34.682 --> 03:37.385
- SHUT UP.
SURE.

03:37.418 --> 03:38.919
HELLO.

03:38.952 --> 03:41.755
[whispering]
RAY, IT'S DR. NORA!

03:41.789 --> 03:43.357
HI, THERE.

03:43.391 --> 03:45.826
UH-HUH.
[chopping]

03:45.859 --> 03:46.694
DO YOU HAVE TO DO THAT NOW?

03:46.727 --> 03:47.695
STOP IT.

03:47.728 --> 03:48.929
UH-HUH.

03:51.332 --> 03:53.834
OH, REALLY?

03:53.867 --> 03:55.569
WOW.

03:55.603 --> 03:57.705
THAT WOULD BE TERRIFIC.
[ice cubes clanking]

03:57.738 --> 03:58.706
SHH!

03:58.739 --> 04:00.574
YEAH.
- WHAT?

04:00.608 --> 04:01.575
- OH, MY GOD.

04:01.609 --> 04:03.511
I AM SO FLATTERED.

04:03.544 --> 04:06.680
[rustling]

04:06.714 --> 04:07.948
WHEN WOULD THAT BE?

04:09.817 --> 04:11.519
YEAH.

04:11.552 --> 04:14.422
[snap]

04:14.455 --> 04:15.789
YEAH, I THINK
THAT WOULD BE FINE.

04:15.823 --> 04:16.990
[snap]

04:17.024 --> 04:17.991
NO, IT WOULD--
WELL, LISTEN,

04:18.025 --> 04:19.793
IT'S GREAT TALKING TO YOU,

04:19.827 --> 04:22.396
'CAUSE I'VE BEEN LISTENING
TO YOU FOR YEARS, AND--

04:22.430 --> 04:24.932
YES--OKAY, WELL,
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

04:24.965 --> 04:26.934
OKAY, TAKE CARE.
OKAY, BYE.

04:26.967 --> 04:30.304
RAY! BAGS!

04:30.338 --> 04:31.505
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT WAS?

04:31.539 --> 04:32.740
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT WAS?

04:32.773 --> 04:35.843
- A MAGICAL ILLUSION.

04:35.876 --> 04:39.480
- DR. NORA IS COMING HERE.

04:39.513 --> 04:40.314
SHE'S COMING HERE.

04:40.348 --> 04:41.749
- WHA-WHAT ARE YOU--
GET OUT OF HERE.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.551
WHY HERE?

04:43.584 --> 04:45.052
- SHE WANTS TO INTERVIEW ME
FOR A BOOK SHE'S DOING

04:45.085 --> 04:46.687
ON THE AMERICAN FAMILY.

04:46.720 --> 04:47.688
- WHY YOU?

04:47.721 --> 04:48.856
- BECAUSE SHE SAYS

04:48.889 --> 04:51.425
I'M PART OF
A VANISHING BREED:

04:51.459 --> 04:54.328
THE HOUSEWIFE.

04:54.362 --> 04:55.329
- I CALLED YOU THAT.

04:55.363 --> 04:57.531
YOU MADE ME SIT
IN THE GARAGE.

04:57.565 --> 05:00.534
- HONEY, I CAN'T BELIEVE
SHE'S COMING HERE!

05:00.568 --> 05:01.635
NOW, LISTEN.

05:01.669 --> 05:02.903
SHE MEANS A LOT TO ME.

05:02.936 --> 05:07.541
SO YOU CAN'T BE DOING
ALL THIS--STUFF, OKAY?

05:07.575 --> 05:10.511
YOU GOT TO LOOK LIKE
SOMEONE I WOULD BE WITH.

05:12.580 --> 05:14.047
- I'M NOT GOING TO BE
WITH YOU TOMORROW

05:14.081 --> 05:15.483
'CAUSE I'M GOING GOLFING.

05:15.516 --> 05:16.950
- YOU HAVE TO BE HERE, RAY.

05:16.984 --> 05:19.052
- AWW--
- THE BOOK'S ABOUT FAMILIES.

05:19.086 --> 05:21.121
AND LISTEN, SHE LOVES TO ASK
REALLY TOUGH QUESTIONS,

05:21.154 --> 05:22.923
SO WE GOT TO GET
OUR STORY STRAIGHT.

05:22.956 --> 05:24.725
- STORY STRAIGHT?

05:24.758 --> 05:26.494
WHAT'D WE DO,
KNOCK OVER A 7-ELEVEN?

05:26.527 --> 05:29.129
- OKAY, NOW, THAT'S EXACTLY
THE KIND OF THING

05:29.162 --> 05:30.731
THAT IS GOING
TO KILL US,

05:30.764 --> 05:32.900
YOUR SENSE OF "HUMOR."

05:38.572 --> 05:40.841
- IN SPORTS, THE INTERNATIONAL
BASKETBALL LEAGUE

05:40.874 --> 05:42.443
WAS BUSY LAST NIGHT--

05:42.476 --> 05:43.276
- HEY!

05:43.310 --> 05:44.845
- HEY, HEY, HEY,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

05:44.878 --> 05:46.079
- TURNING OFF THE TV.

05:46.113 --> 05:48.081
YOU KNOW, IN FACT,
WE SHOULD MOVE THE TV.

05:48.115 --> 05:49.049
I DON'T WANT DR. NORA
TO THINK

05:49.082 --> 05:51.452
THIS IS THE FOCAL POINT
OF OUR LIVING ROOM.

05:51.485 --> 05:53.353
- IT'S THE FOCAL POINT
OF OUR LIVES.

05:54.688 --> 05:56.790
- RAY, JUST MOVE THIS
INTO THE DEN, OKAY?

05:56.824 --> 05:57.991
[doorbell rings]

05:58.025 --> 05:59.960
[gasps]
OH, MY GOD, THAT'S HER.

05:59.993 --> 06:01.128
NO, NO, NO, NO.
I'LL GET IT.

06:01.161 --> 06:02.396
I'LL GET IT.
I'LL GET IT.

06:02.430 --> 06:03.997
JUST, RAY, PLEASE.
ALL RIGHT?

06:04.031 --> 06:05.466
- PLEASE WHAT?

06:05.499 --> 06:08.936
- JUST...
PLEASE.

06:13.173 --> 06:14.575
- HELLO.
- HI!

06:14.608 --> 06:15.776
- DEBRA?

06:15.809 --> 06:17.678
- YES. OH, MY GOD.
COME ON IN.

06:17.711 --> 06:19.780
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

06:19.813 --> 06:21.482
RAY, THIS IS DR. SARAZIN.

06:21.515 --> 06:22.883
- THERE'S NO REASON
TO BE SO FORMAL.

06:22.916 --> 06:23.851
CALL ME DR. NORA.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.486
- [laughing]

06:25.519 --> 06:27.688
DR. NORA.

06:27.721 --> 06:28.689
STUPID.

06:28.722 --> 06:29.857
[laughing]

06:29.890 --> 06:31.525
- YOU HAVE A LOVELY HOME.
- OH, THANKS.

06:31.559 --> 06:33.861
YOU KNOW, WE'RE GOING TO
REPAINT THIS ROOM.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.496
- TOO MANY BAD MEMORIES HERE.

06:35.529 --> 06:37.565
[chuckles]
- [laughing]

06:37.598 --> 06:39.166
[Debra laughs]

06:39.199 --> 06:40.901
- AND, UH--WELL,
THESE ARE OUR TWO BOYS,

06:40.934 --> 06:42.035
GEOFFREY AND MICHAEL.

06:42.069 --> 06:44.738
- WHAT ADORABLE TWINS.

06:44.772 --> 06:45.939
- OH, THANK YOU.

06:45.973 --> 06:48.041
- IT IS GOOD
YOU DRESS THEM DIFFERENTLY.

06:48.075 --> 06:49.543
- WELL, OF COURSE,

06:49.577 --> 06:50.978
BECAUSE THEY'RE
TWO DIFFERENT PEOPLE

06:51.011 --> 06:53.681
WITH DIFFERENT
PERSONALITIES.

06:53.714 --> 06:56.650
AND--AND THIS IS
MY DAUGHTER, ALLY.

06:56.684 --> 06:58.719
- HELLO!

06:58.752 --> 07:00.888
WHAT ARE YOU DRAWING THERE,
ALLY?

07:00.921 --> 07:03.791
- NAKED BARBIES.

07:03.824 --> 07:05.225
- UM--HONEY,

07:05.258 --> 07:07.661
WHY DON'T WE DRAW BARBIE
BUILDING SOMETHING, HUH?

07:07.695 --> 07:08.796
- SHE COULD STILL BE NAKED.

07:08.829 --> 07:12.566
- [laughing]

07:12.600 --> 07:13.567
- [laughing]
I KNOW.

07:13.601 --> 07:15.603
ISN'T HE FUNNY?

07:15.636 --> 07:17.605
- CAN YOU GO SOON?

07:17.638 --> 07:20.574
- OKAY, SWEETIE,
IT'S NAP TIME NOW, OKAY?

07:20.608 --> 07:21.575
- YOU WANT ME
TO GET 'EM UP?

07:21.609 --> 07:23.176
- OH, NO, I'LL GET 'EM.

07:23.210 --> 07:24.211
I LOVE CARING
FOR THE CHILDREN.

07:24.244 --> 07:25.513
YOU KNOW THAT.

07:25.546 --> 07:28.081
IT'S SO...
FULFILLING.

07:28.115 --> 07:29.617
[cooing]
OKAY, COME ON.

07:29.650 --> 07:31.018
COME ON, ALLY, LET'S GO.

07:31.051 --> 07:32.653
I'LL READ YOU A STORY, OKAY?

07:32.686 --> 07:34.121
I'LL BE JUST A MINUTE,
ALL RIGHT?

07:34.154 --> 07:35.923
AND, UH, RAY.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.558
DON'T--

07:37.591 --> 07:41.895
- DON'T WHAT?
- JUST DON'T.

07:41.929 --> 07:44.197
- SO, RAY, WHAT'S IT LIKE
HAVING THREE CHILDREN

07:44.231 --> 07:46.967
UNDER THE AGE OF FIVE?

07:47.000 --> 07:48.836
- WELL--

07:48.869 --> 07:52.540
I LIKE TO TELL PEOPLE
IT'S KIND OF LIKE A FRAT HOUSE.

07:52.573 --> 07:53.707
YEAH.

07:53.741 --> 07:55.943
NOBODY SLEEPS,
EVERYTHING'S BROKEN,

07:55.976 --> 07:58.712
AND THERE'S A LOT
OF THROWING UP.

08:01.582 --> 08:03.083
- CAN I QUOTE YOU?

08:03.116 --> 08:04.117
- WHY, YOU LIKE THAT?

08:04.151 --> 08:05.152
- OH, YEAH, I DO.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.488
- GET BACK IN THE CRIB NOW!

08:10.223 --> 08:13.293
- SAID THE MAMA BEAR
TO THE THREE LITTLE BEARS.

08:13.326 --> 08:14.995
SHE TELLS GREAT STORIES, DEB.

08:15.028 --> 08:17.531
[knock on door]
- RAY--

08:17.565 --> 08:20.668
THERE'S A BIG BLACK CAR
PARKED IN YOUR DRIVEWAY.

08:20.701 --> 08:22.870
- YEAH, DEBRA'S GOT SOME
COMPANY, ALL RIGHT, SO--

08:22.903 --> 08:25.138
- YOU KNOW WHO DRIVES
BIG BLACK CARS?

08:25.172 --> 08:28.075
THE FEDS.

08:28.108 --> 08:29.543
- IT'S MY CAR.

08:29.577 --> 08:31.144
I'M HERE TO SEE DEBRA.

08:31.178 --> 08:32.880
- OOH, WAIT A MINUTE.

08:32.913 --> 08:34.748
SAY SOMETHING ELSE.

08:34.782 --> 08:36.550
- HELLO.
I'M DR. NORA.

08:36.584 --> 08:38.952
- OH, THAT VOICE.

08:38.986 --> 08:42.723
ARE YOU DR. NORA?

08:42.756 --> 08:43.724
- THAT'S ME.

08:43.757 --> 08:44.958
- OHH! OH HO HO!

08:44.992 --> 08:47.961
I CAN'T TELL YOU
WHAT A HUGE FAN I AM OF YOURS.

08:47.995 --> 08:51.031
YOU TAUGHT ME
TO EXPRESS MYSELF.

08:51.064 --> 08:53.200
- THANKS A BUNCH, LADY.

08:55.603 --> 08:57.738
- THESE ARE
THE KIND OF PARENTS

08:57.771 --> 08:59.239
THAT KEEP YOU
IN BUSINESS.

08:59.272 --> 09:00.808
- WE LIVE
RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET.

09:00.841 --> 09:02.009
- REALLY?

09:02.042 --> 09:03.811
- HOW YOU FIXED FOR PIE, RAY?

09:03.844 --> 09:06.680
- I TAKE IT THE BOUNDARIES
ARE RATHER INFORMAL.

09:06.714 --> 09:08.782
- OH, THEY'RE RATHER INVISIBLE,
REALLY.

09:08.816 --> 09:11.585
- OH, YOU AND I
HAVE A LOT IN COMMON.

09:11.619 --> 09:12.986
- ALL RIGHT, MA,
DR. NORA'S GOT TIME

09:13.020 --> 09:14.254
TO WRITE YOU
ONE QUICK PRESCRIPTION,

09:14.287 --> 09:17.190
THEN YOU GOT TO GO, OKAY?

09:17.224 --> 09:22.162
- OH, I AM SO GLAD THAT DEBRA'S
SEEING SOMEONE, YOU KNOW.

09:22.195 --> 09:24.732
I MEAN,
JUST BETWEEN US,

09:24.765 --> 09:26.333
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER?

09:28.035 --> 09:30.904
- SO YOU'RE A RADIO DOCTOR, HUH?
- UH-HUH.

09:30.938 --> 09:32.606
- YOU WOULDN'T THINK
YOU'D HAVE TO BE ON THE RADIO

09:32.640 --> 09:33.907
WITH THAT FIGURE.

09:33.941 --> 09:35.609
- FRANK!

09:37.277 --> 09:38.979
- IT'S A COMPLIMENT.

09:39.012 --> 09:42.883
- YEAH, HE USED TO WRITE
FOR HALLMARK, MY FATHER.

09:42.916 --> 09:45.118
- YOU STILL DON'T KNOW
HOW TO BEHAVE, DO YOU?

09:45.152 --> 09:47.020
- HEY, LEAVE ME ALONE.
I'M TALKING.

09:47.054 --> 09:48.722
- YOU'RE NOT TALKING;
YOU'RE EMBARRASSING.

09:48.756 --> 09:50.290
YOU ALWAYS DO THAT TO ME.

09:50.323 --> 09:52.993
LIKE WITH LEE AND STAN
IN THE RESTAURANT.

09:53.026 --> 09:55.328
- [singing] I'M NOT LISTENING
ANYMORE, DOO-DAH, DOO-DAH

09:55.362 --> 09:57.030
- HE DOES THAT TO TRY
TO DROWN ME OUT.

09:57.064 --> 09:58.131
HOW DO YOU LIKE IT
IF I SAY,

09:58.165 --> 10:00.701
[singing] OH, FRANK BARONE,
WILL YOU SHUT UP TONIGHT

10:00.734 --> 10:01.769
SHUT UP TONIGHT

10:01.802 --> 10:02.836
SHUT UP TONIGHT

10:02.870 --> 10:04.137
[both singing
over each other]

10:04.171 --> 10:06.940
SHUT UP TONIGHT,
SHUT UP TONIGHT

10:06.974 --> 10:11.879
- ALL RIGHT, DAD, STOP IT.
MOM!

10:11.912 --> 10:15.048
LOOK, COMPANY.

10:15.082 --> 10:17.350
- RAY, COME HERE.

10:17.384 --> 10:19.286
DR. NORA IS HERE
TO TALK TO ME,

10:19.319 --> 10:22.756
NOT TO--
PEACHES AND HERB.

10:22.790 --> 10:23.757
- I KNOW. ALL RIGHT.

10:23.791 --> 10:25.192
I'M GOING TO GET RID OF THEM.

10:25.225 --> 10:27.027
DON'T CALL MY MOTHER HERB.

10:27.060 --> 10:28.161
[knock on door]

10:28.195 --> 10:29.429
- HEY.

10:29.462 --> 10:31.098
- RAY--

10:31.131 --> 10:32.432
- OH, ROBERT!

10:32.465 --> 10:34.768
I WANT YOU
TO MEET DR. NORA,

10:34.802 --> 10:37.037
THE FAMOUS PSYCHOLOGIST
FROM THE RADIO.

10:37.070 --> 10:38.371
- HELLO!

10:40.941 --> 10:42.342
- IS THIS ABOUT ME?

10:44.912 --> 10:47.180
- UM--ACTUALLY,
IT'S NOT ABOUT ANY OF YOU.

10:47.214 --> 10:48.381
DR. NORA IS HERE
TO TALK TO ME,

10:48.415 --> 10:50.083
SO THANKS FOR VISITING--

10:50.117 --> 10:52.052
- OH, DEBRA, I WOULD LOVE
IF THEY WOULD STAY.

10:52.085 --> 10:54.421
I THINK THEY'D ADD
AN INTERESTING DIMENSION

10:54.454 --> 10:55.989
TO THE PIECE.

10:56.023 --> 10:57.457
- HEY, CHIPS.

10:57.490 --> 10:58.759
- [mumbling]
YOU HEAR THAT?

10:58.792 --> 11:01.261
WE'RE INTERESTING.

11:01.294 --> 11:04.364
- AND YOUR HUSBAND
IS VERY FUNNY.

11:04.397 --> 11:05.833
- SHE'S GOING TO QUOTE ME.

11:05.866 --> 11:07.868
- WELL, YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY,

11:07.901 --> 11:09.302
THAT'S WHY I MARRIED HIM,
DR. NORA,

11:09.336 --> 11:11.138
FOR HIS SENSE OF HUMOR.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.172
YOU SEE, UM,

11:12.205 --> 11:15.342
WE MET WHEN I WAS DOING P.R.
FOR A HOCKEY TEAM.

11:15.375 --> 11:16.744
AND I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE GOING TO SAY.

11:16.777 --> 11:18.278
"OH, A WOMAN IN HOCKEY?"

11:18.311 --> 11:21.949
BUT ACTUALLY, UM,
IT WASN'T AS--UM--

11:21.982 --> 11:23.450
I--WELL--

11:23.483 --> 11:26.386
I'M NOT SURE
IF THAT'S THE, UH,

11:26.419 --> 11:28.388
KIND OF INFORMATION
THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

11:28.421 --> 11:30.490
WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO GET RIGHT
TO OUR SEX LIFE?

11:30.523 --> 11:32.325
- EXCUSE ME.

11:32.359 --> 11:34.227
ARE YOU VERY NERVOUS
RIGHT NOW,

11:34.261 --> 11:37.064
OR DO YOU DO THAT
ALL THE TIME?

11:37.097 --> 11:38.365
- DO WHAT?

11:49.309 --> 11:50.477
[door opens]

11:52.880 --> 11:53.847
- HEY.

11:53.881 --> 11:54.414
[door closes]

11:57.317 --> 12:02.856
HMM-MM.

12:02.890 --> 12:05.826
ALL RIGHT, I'M NO EXPERT
IN BODY LANGUAGE, BUT--

12:05.859 --> 12:07.795
STOP YELLING.

12:09.362 --> 12:12.332
- DR. NORA WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE HERE FOR ME,

12:12.365 --> 12:14.234
NOT YOUR FAMILY,
AND BY THE END,

12:14.267 --> 12:15.969
SHE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
I WAS IN THE ROOM.

12:16.003 --> 12:17.470
- SURE, SHE DID.

12:17.504 --> 12:21.274
WHO DID SHE THINK
WAS BRINGING HER ALL THAT--PIE?

12:23.877 --> 12:25.545
LOOK, OF COURSE SHE WAS
INTERESTED IN THEM.

12:25.578 --> 12:27.280
SOME SHRINKS GOT TO GO
TO 40 INSTITUTIONS

12:27.314 --> 12:30.350
TO FIND ALL THE ACTION SHE FOUND
IN THAT ROOM TODAY.

12:32.352 --> 12:33.854
- YEAH, SHE WAS
PRETTY INTERESTED

12:33.887 --> 12:35.923
IN YOU TOO, HUH?

12:35.956 --> 12:37.290
- AND ME--

12:37.324 --> 12:39.392
LITTLE BIT.

12:39.426 --> 12:40.794
I THINK SHE WAS
VERY IMPRESSED

12:40.828 --> 12:43.964
WITH MY WEEKLY UNDERWEAR
SCHEDULE.

12:43.997 --> 12:45.032
HUH? EIGHT YEARS.

12:45.065 --> 12:48.301
EIGHT YEARS
YOU MADE FUN OF ME.

12:48.335 --> 12:50.003
COME ON.

12:50.037 --> 12:53.440
- DR. NORA
THOUGHT I WAS BORING.

12:53.473 --> 12:54.908
- LOOK, YOU'RE NOT BORING.

12:54.942 --> 12:57.277
YOU'RE--NORMAL.

12:57.310 --> 12:59.346
ALL RIGHT? THAT'S GOOD.

12:59.379 --> 13:00.147
GROWING UP IN MY FAMILY,

13:00.180 --> 13:04.117
I PRAYED FOR NORMAL
EVERY NIGHT.

13:04.151 --> 13:05.452
THEN I'D FALL ASLEEP

13:05.485 --> 13:09.990
TO THE SOUND OF MY BROTHER
NAMING HIS TOES.

13:10.023 --> 13:13.060
THERE WAS, UH, FAT TONY,

13:13.093 --> 13:14.862
JIMMY THE WEASEL,

13:14.895 --> 13:17.430
BILLY, STRETCH,
AND TASTES BAD.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.200
- [sighs]

13:20.233 --> 13:23.203
I WAS SO EXCITED
THAT DR. NORA WAS COMING HERE,

13:23.236 --> 13:24.838
BUT THERE'S NO WAY
I COULD FOLLOW

13:24.872 --> 13:27.074
THE DYSFUNCTIONAL
FAMILY CIRCUS.

13:29.576 --> 13:31.411
- WELL, YOU SHOULD'VE WENT ON
BEFORE THEM.

13:33.580 --> 13:35.849
LOOK, MAYBE IF YOU'D
BEEN YOURSELF,

13:35.883 --> 13:37.450
DR. NORA WOULD'VE
BEEN MORE INTERESTED.

13:37.484 --> 13:39.119
WHY DID YOU GO PUT ON
A BIG ACT FOR HER?

13:39.152 --> 13:41.288
- BECAUSE I AM BORING!

13:48.228 --> 13:51.031
THERE'S, YOU KNOW,
NOTHING ABOUT ME

13:51.064 --> 13:53.934
THAT'S--YOU KNOW,
LIKE, QUIRKY

13:53.967 --> 13:58.471
OR FUNNY,
OR INTERESTING.

14:03.043 --> 14:04.344
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

14:06.279 --> 14:08.581
- UM, THERE'S A LITTLE
LEFT IN THERE.

14:08.615 --> 14:09.950
SORRY.

14:09.983 --> 14:11.251
- NO, SEE, THAT'S
EXACTLY MY PROBLEM.

14:11.284 --> 14:13.320
I DON'T DO THAT.

14:13.353 --> 14:16.389
- DO WHAT?
- LICK THE BOWL!

14:16.423 --> 14:18.525
I MEAN, THAT'S THE KIND
OF GREAT WEIRD STUFF

14:18.558 --> 14:21.428
YOU FREAKIN' GUYS
DO ALL THE TIME.

14:24.231 --> 14:27.034
- WHAT? WHAT DO YOU MEAN, THIS?
YOU COULD DO THIS.

14:27.067 --> 14:29.302
YOU--COME ON.

14:29.336 --> 14:31.004
COME ON.

14:31.038 --> 14:33.306
COME ON.

14:33.340 --> 14:37.577
COME TO THE DARK SIDE.

14:37.610 --> 14:39.980
COME ON.

14:40.013 --> 14:42.182
LICK THE BOWL.

14:42.215 --> 14:43.984
"I WON'T HURT YOU.

14:44.017 --> 14:46.653
I'M JUST A BOWL,
THAT'S ALL."

14:49.022 --> 14:52.359
ALL RIGHT,
WE'LL WORK ON IT.

14:52.392 --> 14:56.329
- LOOK, RAY, JUST TELL ME
SOMETHING, OKAY?

14:56.363 --> 14:58.932
DO YOU THINK THAT I'M--

14:58.966 --> 14:59.899
BORING?

14:59.933 --> 15:02.269
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR YOUR ANSWER, RAY.

15:02.302 --> 15:04.104
- OH, COME ON.
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

15:04.137 --> 15:07.374
COME ON, DEB.

15:07.407 --> 15:08.441
DEB--

15:22.389 --> 15:24.057
- ALLY, WANT SOME
CHOCOLATE MILK?

15:24.091 --> 15:26.493
YEAH? YEAH.

15:31.764 --> 15:34.467
ALLY, HOW DID YOU
THINK OF THAT?

15:34.501 --> 15:36.703
- IT'S EASY.

15:36.736 --> 15:40.173
- GUESS YOU JUST HAVE TO BE
A BLOOD RELATIVE.

15:42.142 --> 15:42.709
- HELLO, DEAR.

15:42.742 --> 15:44.711
- HI.

15:44.744 --> 15:47.147
- OH, WHAT'S FOR DINNER?

15:47.180 --> 15:48.415
- JUST TURKEY DOGS.

15:48.448 --> 15:50.483
- TURKEY DOGS?

15:50.517 --> 15:53.620
WHAT AN INTERESTING CHOICE.

15:53.653 --> 15:56.189
- WELL, I HAVE THEM EVERY WEEK.

15:56.223 --> 15:59.692
- THAT'S TOTALLY, UH, INSANE.

16:02.062 --> 16:03.630
- WHAT?

16:03.663 --> 16:05.698
- WHAT HE MEANS IS

16:05.732 --> 16:10.303
YOU'VE GOT SOME
IMAGINATION THERE, DEBRA.

16:10.337 --> 16:11.404
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING, HONEY?

16:11.438 --> 16:13.406
- CAN I BE EXCUSED?

16:13.440 --> 16:15.175
- WELL, YOU DIDN'T
FINISH YOUR HOT DOG.

16:15.208 --> 16:17.377
- IT TASTES
LIKE CHOCOLATE MILK.

16:18.445 --> 16:20.547
- OKAY.

16:20.580 --> 16:22.782
- ISN'T SHE MARVELOUS
WITH THE KIDS, HUH?

16:22.815 --> 16:25.485
SO, UH, OFFBEAT.

16:28.521 --> 16:31.291
- SO--DEBRA.
HI.

16:31.324 --> 16:32.659
- HI.

16:32.692 --> 16:34.194
- OH, LOOK.

16:34.227 --> 16:37.664
YOU'RE WEARING SLIPPERS
AND SOCKS AT THE SAME TIME.

16:40.500 --> 16:44.671
THAT'S--THAT IS
SO UNIQUE AND DIFFERENT.

16:50.443 --> 16:51.678
- OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

16:51.711 --> 16:53.813
YOU CAN ALL STOP NOW.
I GET IT.

16:53.846 --> 16:55.315
- STOP WHAT?

16:55.348 --> 16:57.317
- TRYING TO MAKE ME FEEL
LIKE I'M INTERESTING.

16:57.350 --> 17:00.120
IT'S A VERY NICE EFFORT,
BUT IT'S A LITTLE TRANSPARENT.

17:00.153 --> 17:02.055
- WHAT'S SHE TALKING ABOUT?

17:02.089 --> 17:04.157
- THAT'S THAT IMAGINATION AGAIN.

17:04.191 --> 17:05.558
- ALL RIGHT ALREADY.

17:07.627 --> 17:10.130
- HEY, HONEY. WHAT'S UP?

17:10.163 --> 17:11.231
- GUESS WHAT, RAY.

17:11.264 --> 17:12.365
YOUR FAMILY CAME OVER

17:12.399 --> 17:15.268
TO CONVINCE ME
THAT I'M FASCINATING.

17:15.302 --> 17:17.604
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
ALL AT ONCE?

17:20.340 --> 17:21.641
NOT ONE AT A TIME,

17:21.674 --> 17:25.078
WHICH WOULD BE THE SMART,
SUBTLE WAY?

17:31.251 --> 17:34.754
- YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU'RE FEELING
REALLY BAD ABOUT YOURSELF,

17:34.787 --> 17:36.323
THERE'S NOTHING TO MAKE YOU
FEEL BETTER

17:36.356 --> 17:37.357
THAN BEING PATRONIZED.

17:37.390 --> 17:39.392
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, RAY.

17:39.426 --> 17:42.495
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

17:42.529 --> 17:44.564
WHAT DID YOU DO?
WHAT DID YOU DO?

17:44.597 --> 17:46.166
- WELL, WE TRIED
TO DO WHAT YOU SAID,

17:46.199 --> 17:50.370
BUT SHE DIDN'T GIVE US
MUCH TO WORK WITH.

17:50.403 --> 17:52.639
- SOCKS AND SLIPPERS.

17:52.672 --> 17:54.107
- OKAY, I'M VERY BORING!

17:54.141 --> 17:55.408
YES, I KNOW.

17:55.442 --> 17:56.576
I'M VERY BORING, OKAY?

17:56.609 --> 17:57.510
WE CAN ALL AGREE.

17:57.544 --> 18:00.780
- OH, HONEY, I WOULD NEVER
CALL YOU BORING.

18:00.813 --> 18:04.217
YOU--YOU--YOU JUST LACK
A CERTAIN--

18:04.251 --> 18:05.518
- FLAIR!

18:08.388 --> 18:11.491
- FLAIR, LIKE ALL OF YOU HAVE.

18:11.524 --> 18:13.860
- WELL, YOUR DR. NORA
SEEMS TO THINK SO.

18:13.893 --> 18:15.328
- YEAH, SHE'S SENDING
A PHOTOGRAPHER OVER

18:15.362 --> 18:17.730
TO TAKE OUR PICTURE.

18:17.764 --> 18:19.399
- ALL RIGHT, STOP HELPING OUT.
THANKS.

18:19.432 --> 18:20.800
- NO, NO, THAT'S OKAY.

18:20.833 --> 18:22.402
THEY'RE RIGHT.
I'M NOT INTERESTING.

18:22.435 --> 18:25.138
I DON'T HAVE FLAIR.

18:25.172 --> 18:27.674
I MEAN, MAYBE I WOULD
HAVE FLAIR IF I, UH--

18:27.707 --> 18:31.711
OH, BARGED INTO PEOPLE'S HOUSES
50 TIMES A DAY GOING, UH,

18:31.744 --> 18:34.581
"OH, WHAT'S THAT, DEAR?

18:34.614 --> 18:37.850
"OH, FROSTING IN A CAN.
[chuckling]

18:37.884 --> 18:41.221
SO MUCH EASIER THAN HOMEMADE."

18:41.254 --> 18:42.355
YEAH, YEAH,

I'LL GO OVER IN THE MORNING
AND APOLOGIZE, ALL RIGHT?

19:59.599 --> 20:01.334

- RAY, YOU JUST, YOU KNOW,
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE

20:41.073 --> 20:46.613
TO GO THROUGH YOUR WHOLE LIFE
JUST--NORMAL.

20:46.646 --> 20:49.382
- YOU DON'T GET IT.
YOU GOT TO BE NORMAL.

20:49.416 --> 20:50.517
I MEAN, LOOK AT ALL OF US.

TO BE NICE.

21:03.062 --> 21:06.733

21:06.766 --> 21:07.900
WHY WOULD ANY NORMAL PERSON

21:07.934 --> 21:12.839
PUT UP WITH US
FOR AS LONG AS YOU HAVE?

21:12.872 --> 21:13.840
- I DON'T KNOW.

21:13.873 --> 21:14.841
- THAT--THAT'S RIGHT.

21:14.874 --> 21:16.309
I WAS BORN INTO THIS FAMILY.

21:16.343 --> 21:18.378
I'M STUCK WITH THEM, BUT--

21:18.411 --> 21:23.816
WHAT KIND OF WEIRDO
WOULD CHOOSE TO BE ONE OF US?

21:23.850 --> 21:26.686
THERE'S SOMETHING
WRONG WITH YOU.

21:28.988 --> 21:30.923
- YOU KNOW,
YOU REALLY THINK SO?

21:30.957 --> 21:32.392
YOU THINK SOMETHING'S WRONG
WITH ME?

21:32.425 --> 21:33.660

LOOK AT YOU.

21:33.693 --> 21:35.828
HOW COULD YOU EXPLAIN IT?

21:35.862 --> 21:39.065
- YEAH, I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.

21:39.098 --> 21:40.833
I'M REALLY WEIRD.
- YOU'RE WEIRD.

21:40.867 --> 21:42.502
YOU'RE A SICK,
TWISTED INDIVIDUAL.

21:42.535 --> 21:44.036
- REALLY TWISTED, YEAH.

21:44.070 --> 21:46.673
RAY--

21:46.706 --> 21:48.708
- GIVE YOURSELF SOME CREDIT.
- YEAH.

21:50.810 --> 21:55.415
- HEY, YOU KNOW, YOU IMITATED
EVERYBODY TODAY EXCEPT ME.

21:55.448 --> 21:57.450
- I CAN'T DO YOU.

21:57.484 --> 21:58.618
- COME ON.
- NO, I CAN'T.

21:58.651 --> 22:01.020
- GO AHEAD.
GIVE IT A TRY.

22:01.053 --> 22:04.557
- "OHH, NO--

22:04.591 --> 22:09.462
"HONEY, THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG
WITH THE SHOWER."

22:09.496 --> 22:12.465
"GET OUT OF HERE."

22:12.499 --> 22:16.703
"OOH, MY RASH IS BACK."

22:24.911 --> 22:26.813
- YOU KNOW, IT ISN'T FUNNY
IF IT HURTS THE OTHER PERSON.

22:26.846 --> 22:28.781
YOU KNOW THAT.
