02:24.074 --> 02:25.806
I finally got her down.

02:25.842 --> 02:27.476
You finally woke up, you mean.

02:27.512 --> 02:30.745
I can't help it. It's like snuggling with

02:30.781 --> 02:32.747
the cutest little hot water bottle.

02:32.783 --> 02:36.418
Well, your timing is perfect.

02:36.454 --> 02:37.652
Dinner is served.

02:37.688 --> 02:40.454
It's so good having
Allie work nights lately.

02:40.490 --> 02:42.723
I love having Bethany for bedtimes.

02:42.759 --> 02:45.661
I love seeing her fat
little face in the morning.

02:45.697 --> 02:49.533
You ever thought about
having one of our own?

02:54.405 --> 02:57.339
Hello?

02:57.375 --> 02:58.739
<i>Jane, it's Keaton.</i>

02:58.775 --> 03:00.375
<i>Get out of the house
right now, it's...</i>

03:48.893 --> 03:52.094
Hi.

03:52.130 --> 03:54.029
What the hell just happened?

03:56.733 --> 03:59.834
Bertrand Keele. German steel titan

03:59.870 --> 04:02.738
- and former Sandstorm loyalist.
- Sandstorm's done.

04:02.774 --> 04:05.740
Yes, which apparently made
Bertrand very, very angry.

04:05.776 --> 04:07.142
You don't take down one of the biggest

04:07.178 --> 04:08.543
terrorist organizations in the world

04:08.579 --> 04:09.745
without making some enemies.

04:09.781 --> 04:11.947
So this Keele person wants me dead?

04:11.983 --> 04:13.447
This Keele person is dead.

04:13.483 --> 04:15.584
He knew the CIA was closing in on him,

04:15.620 --> 04:16.817
but before he took his own life

04:16.853 --> 04:21.654
our intel confirmed that he put
a $10 million bounty on yours.

04:21.690 --> 04:23.391
- So it's over, then?
- No.

04:23.427 --> 04:25.761
The bounty's in escrow
with a dark web fixer.

04:25.797 --> 04:28.897
It's still active, and
we can't shut it down.

04:28.933 --> 04:32.467
The best assassins in the
world are about to come at you.

04:32.503 --> 04:34.136
They're not gonna stop
until someone collects,

04:34.172 --> 04:35.669
and they're not gonna care who's standing

04:35.705 --> 04:37.071
between you and them when they do.

04:37.107 --> 04:40.775
So we take this fixer
down. Stop it at the source.

04:40.811 --> 04:43.778
Guy's a ghost. CIA's
been after him for years.

04:43.814 --> 04:45.614
Look, Jane... Jane.

04:45.650 --> 04:46.948
We need to get you out of here.

04:46.984 --> 04:49.785
Now, I can set you up with
a new ID, passports, money...

04:49.821 --> 04:52.153
No... no.

04:52.189 --> 04:53.888
There has to be another way.

04:53.924 --> 04:55.157
- Kurt...
- There has to be.

04:55.193 --> 04:57.025
Kurt...

04:57.061 --> 04:59.427
I love you,

04:59.463 --> 05:01.830
but you know that he's right.

05:01.866 --> 05:03.965
It's not safe if I stay.

05:04.001 --> 05:06.635
For any of us.

05:06.671 --> 05:09.438
Fine. I'm coming with you.

05:09.474 --> 05:11.439
- Kurt...
- Yes, I am.

05:11.475 --> 05:13.508
We find this guy, we take him down.

05:13.544 --> 05:15.676
We put a stop to this.

05:15.712 --> 05:19.114
You're my wife. So whatever we face,

05:19.150 --> 05:20.685
we face together.

05:23.220 --> 05:24.753
Okay.

05:24.789 --> 05:27.459
We'll leave first thing in the morning.

05:51.148 --> 05:53.885
I'm sorry.

06:07.131 --> 06:08.496
Director Hirst.

06:08.532 --> 06:10.265
I heard you were back in town.

06:10.301 --> 06:12.234
Mind if I come in?

06:12.270 --> 06:14.039
Uh, no. Please.

06:15.873 --> 06:18.273
So you're finally selling this place, huh?

06:18.309 --> 06:21.710
Well, don't have much of a choice.

06:21.746 --> 06:23.811
Searching the world for your missing wife

06:23.847 --> 06:25.679
and the man that has a bounty on her head?

06:25.715 --> 06:27.849
Costs a lot of money... that I don't have.

06:27.885 --> 06:30.652
- That's why I'm here.
- Uh-uh. I told you.

06:30.688 --> 06:32.253
I'm not coming back until I find her.

06:32.289 --> 06:33.922
Keaton got her out of this country

06:33.958 --> 06:36.258
and then she disappeared, so
she's out there alone some...

06:36.294 --> 06:38.225
There's been a new development.

06:38.261 --> 06:41.629
Reade, Zapata, Patterson.

06:41.665 --> 06:44.833
They were all taken last night.

06:44.869 --> 06:47.268
- Who took them?
- We don't know.

06:47.304 --> 06:50.908
But this was waiting for
us in Reade's apartment.

06:58.982 --> 07:01.116
What is this? Some kind of puzzle box?

07:01.152 --> 07:04.119
Our forensics teams believe
the lock is biometric.

07:04.155 --> 07:07.922
Jane is likely the only person
in the world who can open it.

07:07.958 --> 07:10.058
Well, if I knew where she was...

07:10.094 --> 07:11.830
Turn the box over.

07:15.066 --> 07:16.898
Coordinates.

07:16.934 --> 07:20.602
Deep in the heart of Kathmandu, Kurt.

07:20.638 --> 07:23.604
We think we found her.

07:47.832 --> 07:50.669
I can't believe I finally found you.

07:55.739 --> 07:58.205
Patterson, Reade, Tasha. They're missing.

07:58.241 --> 08:00.145
We think they've been kidnapped.

08:01.712 --> 08:04.583
- Well, do you think Roman...
- We don't know.

08:07.885 --> 08:10.951
Whoever took them, they left this.

08:10.987 --> 08:13.989
Now, no one's been able to open it yet.

08:14.025 --> 08:17.628
We think the lock is biometric.

08:25.169 --> 08:27.138
What is this?

08:31.441 --> 08:34.044
It needs both of us to work.

08:47.691 --> 08:49.893
What's happening?

08:59.202 --> 09:00.638
New tattoos.

09:01.872 --> 09:03.137
They're fading. What...

09:03.173 --> 09:05.073
What is this? I don't understand.

09:05.109 --> 09:06.708
Bioluminescence.

09:06.744 --> 09:08.809
This must work like some kind of battery.

09:08.845 --> 09:11.212
How? I don't e...

09:11.248 --> 09:14.953
- What?
- A few months ago, I was in an accident.

09:16.152 --> 09:18.987
I was in and out of consciousness for days.

09:19.023 --> 09:22.256
- So you think whoever did this...
- Must have caused it.

09:22.292 --> 09:24.892
And then added these new
tattoos while I was out.

09:24.928 --> 09:26.461
Why go through all that trouble?

09:26.497 --> 09:29.764
I don't know. But these new puzzles...

09:29.800 --> 09:31.736
Must be how we find out.

09:37.207 --> 09:39.243
So where do we start?

09:40.344 --> 09:43.477
Who am I?

09:43.513 --> 09:45.447
At the beginning.

09:45.483 --> 09:47.314
The first tattoo we ever solved.

09:47.350 --> 09:49.287
It's behind your left ear.

09:52.089 --> 09:57.491
"Not causeless is this
journey into the abyss."

09:57.527 --> 09:59.697
That doesn't sound very good.

10:03.433 --> 10:05.199
It's from "Dante's Inferno."

10:05.235 --> 10:07.202
Canto VII-10.

10:07.238 --> 10:10.038
- You don't think they mean...
- July 10th.

10:10.074 --> 10:12.006
The day that I proposed to you in Venice.

10:12.042 --> 10:14.041
Well, the clue's an Italian reference.

10:14.077 --> 10:16.010
They want us to go back
to St. Mark's Square.

10:16.046 --> 10:19.780
It's all happening again. Isn't it?

10:19.816 --> 10:22.349
But you still have a hit on you.

10:22.385 --> 10:23.818
That hasn't changed.

10:23.854 --> 10:27.355
If you don't want to come, I understand.

10:27.391 --> 10:29.457
Our best friends are missing.

10:29.493 --> 10:30.991
The first clue to saving them

10:31.027 --> 10:32.761
is the first day of our engagement.

10:32.797 --> 10:36.267
We have to do this. Together.

10:38.802 --> 10:40.802
<i>I'm uploading the new
tattoos to you now.</i>

10:40.838 --> 10:45.006
I don't know, there's a
lot of covered up areas.

10:45.042 --> 10:47.842
What? If you want my
comprehensive analysis,

10:47.878 --> 10:49.376
I will require full nudes.

10:49.412 --> 10:50.844
Is that who I think it is?

10:50.880 --> 10:53.113
A lot's changed in 18 months.

10:53.149 --> 10:56.251
Reade's running the NYO,
Tasha went over to the CIA,

10:56.287 --> 10:57.552
she's working for Keaton now.

10:57.588 --> 10:59.453
Patterson moved to Silicon Valley.

10:59.489 --> 11:01.054
She's developing some app thingy.

11:01.090 --> 11:03.123
And Rich Dotcom works for the FBI?

11:03.159 --> 11:05.293
Mr. Dotcom helped us bring down

11:05.329 --> 11:07.428
a massive international
terror cell last year

11:07.464 --> 11:09.997
<i>and is brought in from
time to time to assist.</i>

11:10.033 --> 11:11.265
Hey, Jane. It's Rich.

11:11.301 --> 11:13.067
Long time listener, first time caller.

11:13.103 --> 11:15.002
<i>Jane, they got me staying
in your safe house.</i>

11:15.038 --> 11:17.905
It's like I'm living inside
you. It's very intimate.

11:17.941 --> 11:19.908
Which brings us back to these nudes.

11:19.944 --> 11:21.509
Now, if you want my help,
I really am gonna need

11:21.545 --> 11:23.278
to see everything.

11:23.314 --> 11:25.413
Patterson, Reade, and
what's-her-name's lives

11:25.449 --> 11:26.613
may depend on it.

11:26.649 --> 11:29.349
Rich, we'll do complete scans
when we get back to New York.

11:29.385 --> 11:32.520
For now, we know where the
first tattoo's gonna lead us.

11:32.556 --> 11:34.322
I can't believe I'm the one saying this,

11:34.358 --> 11:35.522
but what if this is a trap?

11:35.558 --> 11:36.958
<i>You know? An elaborate ruse</i>

11:36.994 --> 11:38.159
<i>just to get you two out in the open?</i>

11:38.195 --> 11:39.894
Do we really wanna risk it?

11:39.930 --> 11:41.996
At least, before I get my nudes?

11:42.032 --> 11:43.497
Look, whoever put these new puzzles on me,

11:43.533 --> 11:45.033
did it while I was unconscious.

11:45.069 --> 11:47.168
If they wanted me dead,
I'd be dead already.

11:47.204 --> 11:50.407
This is about something bigger.

11:58.581 --> 12:00.113
Hey...

12:00.149 --> 12:04.285
- Reade?
- Take it easy, take it easy.

12:04.321 --> 12:05.919
You've been drugged.

12:05.955 --> 12:07.921
Where the hell are we?

12:07.957 --> 12:09.857
I'm not sure yet. I
just woke up an hour ago.

12:09.893 --> 12:11.892
I heard the guards talking Spanish outside

12:11.928 --> 12:13.928
and our cell's stocked with
plenty of water and MRE,

12:13.964 --> 12:15.929
so whoever took us plans
on keeping us for a while.

12:15.965 --> 12:17.298
That's all I got so far.

12:17.334 --> 12:19.067
It's good to see you.

12:19.103 --> 12:21.068
Even if it takes getting kidnapped.

12:21.104 --> 12:23.004
Can't believe it's been a year.

12:23.040 --> 12:25.039
It hasn't been that long.

12:25.075 --> 12:28.309
I just crossed 365 at the CIA.

12:28.345 --> 12:31.346
You haven't talked to me since I left.

12:31.382 --> 12:33.615
It's been a year.

12:33.651 --> 12:35.616
You remember how they grabbed you?

12:35.652 --> 12:38.318
Where? When?

12:38.354 --> 12:40.225
All right, all right, all right.

12:42.125 --> 12:46.163
No! They got you, too?

12:52.603 --> 12:55.169
Feels like we were here a lifetime ago.

12:55.205 --> 12:58.305
Funny, feels like five minutes ago to me.

12:58.341 --> 13:00.474
This was the first place I looked for you

13:00.510 --> 13:02.242
when you disappeared.

13:02.278 --> 13:05.078
Thought maybe you were laying
low in the hotel we found,

13:05.114 --> 13:07.582
in some place only we'd know about.

13:07.618 --> 13:10.117
- But you weren't.
- I'm sorry.

13:10.153 --> 13:12.386
I knew that you loved me so much

13:12.422 --> 13:14.389
that you would walk away
from your whole life.

13:14.425 --> 13:17.391
But I loved you too
much to let that happen.

13:17.427 --> 13:20.127
I just thought I could
find who was responsible

13:20.163 --> 13:22.597
for the bounty, take them out,

13:22.633 --> 13:25.033
and come right back to you.

13:25.069 --> 13:27.401
But it didn't work out that way.

13:27.437 --> 13:29.569
No, it didn't.

13:29.605 --> 13:31.238
And here we are.

13:31.274 --> 13:33.540
The place where I proposed to you.

13:33.576 --> 13:35.642
Whoever's behind this,

13:35.678 --> 13:37.612
they could've been here that day.

13:37.648 --> 13:39.484
Watching us.

13:42.252 --> 13:43.217
Jane...

13:43.253 --> 13:46.688
Look at that. VII-10.
Just like the tattoo.

13:46.724 --> 13:49.289
And it's definitely not
the correct time right now.

13:49.325 --> 13:51.693
Come on, maybe there's something inside.

14:08.378 --> 14:09.211
Here.

14:09.247 --> 14:12.250
Jane, don't! We'll get the bomb squad in.

14:19.790 --> 14:21.689
There's only one number programmed.

14:21.725 --> 14:23.591
Hit it.

14:23.627 --> 14:26.461
<i>"Edmond smiled when
he beheld himself.</i>

14:26.497 --> 14:28.529
"It was impossible that his best friend...

14:28.565 --> 14:30.464
"if indeed he had any friends left...

14:30.500 --> 14:31.533
"could recognize him.

14:31.569 --> 14:33.534
<i>For he could not recognize himself."</i>

14:33.570 --> 14:34.702
Roman.

14:34.738 --> 14:36.471
It's "The Count of Monte Cristo."

14:36.507 --> 14:38.139
You read it, sis?

14:38.175 --> 14:40.741
<i>It's about a man who's
wrongfully imprisoned</i>

14:40.777 --> 14:44.478
who escapes and gets
revenge on those responsible.

14:44.514 --> 14:46.680
You weren't wrongfully imprisoned, Roman.

14:46.716 --> 14:48.216
You deserve to be locked up.

14:48.252 --> 14:51.285
- Hello, Kurt.
- <i>You did this to me?</i>

14:51.321 --> 14:53.621
These new tattoos? Why?

14:53.657 --> 14:57.759
Penance. You owe me,
sis, for what you've done.

14:57.795 --> 15:02.230
<i>These tattoos are how
you'll pay your way.</i>

15:02.266 --> 15:04.598
But first, we need to get
this price off your head.

15:04.634 --> 15:05.766
<i>Where's the team?</i>

15:05.802 --> 15:08.169
Where's Reade, Tasha, Patterson?

15:08.205 --> 15:10.438
I tracked down the fixer
holding your bounty in escrow

15:10.474 --> 15:12.573
- and arranged a meet.
- Wait, what?

15:12.609 --> 15:14.409
<i>Oh, we crossed paths
on another matter</i>

15:14.445 --> 15:16.376
<i>and I managed to gain his trust.</i>

15:16.412 --> 15:18.645
Now the red syringe contains a chemical

15:18.681 --> 15:20.014
<i>called Succinylcholine.</i>

15:20.050 --> 15:22.616
<i>It'll reduce your heartbeat
to an undetectable crawl.</i>

15:22.652 --> 15:23.852
You gotta be kidding me.

15:23.888 --> 15:26.587
Do you think that we're really
gonna go along with this, Roman?

15:26.623 --> 15:29.357
Weller will then deliver
your quote-unquote dead body

15:29.393 --> 15:32.293
to said fixer to collect the
bounty and remove the hit.

15:32.329 --> 15:34.495
<i>Oh, the green syringe
contains the antidote.</i>

15:34.531 --> 15:36.798
And how do you propose
I get your sister back

15:36.834 --> 15:38.131
after I hand her over?

15:38.167 --> 15:39.634
You don't think the guy's gonna want

15:39.670 --> 15:41.535
- to take her body with him?
- <i>I think I'll leave you two</i>

15:41.571 --> 15:42.504
to iron out the details.

15:42.540 --> 15:46.573
All relevant information
is in the envelope.

15:50.147 --> 15:52.814
The bells...

15:52.850 --> 15:56.184
- I can hear them through the phone.
- He's here.

15:56.220 --> 15:59.820
<i>Why take Reade,
Zapata and Patterson?</i>

15:59.856 --> 16:01.588
To bring you back.

16:01.624 --> 16:03.757
What, you thought you
could just hide forever?

16:03.793 --> 16:05.525
Start some fresh, new life?

16:05.561 --> 16:09.262
<i>No. No, we all have our prisons.</i>

16:09.298 --> 16:11.833
<i>These tattoos are yours.</i>

16:11.869 --> 16:14.434
And what about our friends?
How do we get them back?

16:14.470 --> 16:17.371
<i>You don't. I sold them
to the highest bidder.</i>

16:17.407 --> 16:19.640
They're gone, but this isn't about them.

16:19.676 --> 16:21.375
<i>This is about you.</i>

16:21.411 --> 16:24.278
- Roman!
- <i>Let the games begin.</i>

16:24.314 --> 16:25.746
<i>Good luck, "Jane Doe."</i>

16:36.826 --> 16:38.328
Jane!

18:20.731 --> 18:22.400
Weller!

18:24.868 --> 18:26.633
Here!

18:26.669 --> 18:28.572
Come on.

18:33.010 --> 18:35.313
We'll never catch up.

18:39.063 --> 18:40.647
What the hell just happened?

18:40.683 --> 18:42.850
What do you mean? He got away.

18:42.886 --> 18:44.884
I'm talking about you.

18:44.920 --> 18:46.320
You just took off.

18:46.356 --> 18:49.457
Look, I saw him. So I just... I ran.

18:49.493 --> 18:52.627
I'm a little out of practice
working with a partner.

18:52.663 --> 18:54.661
Last time you left without telling me,

18:54.697 --> 18:56.529
it took me a long time to find you again.

18:56.565 --> 19:01.638
I know. You're right, I'm sorry.

19:03.072 --> 19:04.939
So what now?

19:04.975 --> 19:07.874
Roman's in the wind. We've got nothing.

19:07.910 --> 19:09.846
Not nothing.

19:11.380 --> 19:13.648
Looks like Roman's phone
survived the plunge.

19:13.684 --> 19:16.550
We got all the data you
sent back to us intact.

19:16.586 --> 19:18.619
Yeah, but the big shocker, it's encrypted.

19:18.655 --> 19:20.621
I'm sure if you had the
better part of a week, Stuart,

19:20.657 --> 19:21.822
you could figure it out all by yourself.

19:21.858 --> 19:23.390
But luckily I'm here, so you'll have

19:23.426 --> 19:24.592
the data back in a couple of hours.

19:24.628 --> 19:26.026
- I never said...
- Ta-ta-ta-ta...

19:26.062 --> 19:27.628
<i>Why is Roman doing this?</i>

19:27.664 --> 19:30.064
- What's his endgame?
- If this was just about revenge,

19:30.100 --> 19:31.865
he had plenty of chances to kill all of us.

19:31.901 --> 19:34.634
- Why the new tattoos?
- We have to recover the team,

19:34.670 --> 19:36.370
get back to New York and work all this out.

19:36.406 --> 19:38.639
Rich and Stuart need time
to crack the phone anyway.

19:38.675 --> 19:41.609
Maybe we should just use it
to get this bounty off my head.

19:41.645 --> 19:43.343
We don't know anything about this guy.

19:43.379 --> 19:44.644
And never mind that drug

19:44.680 --> 19:46.314
he wants you to inject yourself with.

19:46.350 --> 19:47.648
Succinylcholine. It actually does

19:47.684 --> 19:49.316
exactly what Roman says it does,

19:49.352 --> 19:51.384
reduce the heartbeat to
an undetectable level.

19:51.420 --> 19:52.887
Yeah, I've actually
used it on myself a bunch

19:52.923 --> 19:54.554
to sneak across the border as a dead body.

19:54.590 --> 19:56.390
Also for some sex stuff that I...

19:56.426 --> 19:57.658
<i>probably shouldn't
bore you two with.</i>

19:57.694 --> 19:59.560
The point is, the only real danger here

19:59.596 --> 20:00.794
is if you don't take the antidote

20:00.830 --> 20:02.529
within 90 minutes, you actually die.

20:02.565 --> 20:04.532
I'm a walking target, Kurt.

20:04.568 --> 20:07.767
And I am tired of running.

20:07.803 --> 20:11.072
Any intel on the dark web
guy controlling the payout?

20:11.108 --> 20:14.408
Leslie Doorhaus, AKA "The Duke of Death."

20:14.444 --> 20:15.575
We've been aware of him for years,

20:15.611 --> 20:17.678
but until now, he's been unfindable.

20:17.714 --> 20:19.612
<i>Acts as a coroner to the underworld.</i>

20:19.648 --> 20:21.681
Holds the bounties, confirms the kills,

20:21.717 --> 20:23.784
and transfers the funds
to the lucky assassins.

20:23.820 --> 20:25.518
Okay, well we have to
meet him in half an hour

20:25.554 --> 20:26.754
at the Abbey of Misericordia.

20:26.790 --> 20:29.122
I can request Italian police set up

20:29.158 --> 20:30.725
a hidden perimeter around the church.

20:30.761 --> 20:32.959
They'll take Doorhaus the second he tries

20:32.995 --> 20:34.495
to move Jane's body for disposal.

20:34.531 --> 20:37.398
It's too risky. This is not a good plan.

20:37.434 --> 20:39.699
- Right now, it's all we got.
- So we wait.

20:39.735 --> 20:41.701
Come up with something better.

20:41.737 --> 20:43.938
We don't have to do this, Jane.

20:43.974 --> 20:47.440
Yes, we do.

20:47.476 --> 20:49.677
We have 90 minutes till
I need the antidote.

20:49.713 --> 20:51.946
Please, Kurt, do this for me.

20:51.982 --> 20:53.484
For us.

20:54.850 --> 20:56.816
Okay, okay, so we've been drugged

20:56.852 --> 20:57.817
for God knows how long.

20:57.853 --> 20:58.785
Which means we could be

20:58.821 --> 21:00.554
pretty much anywhere
in the world right now.

21:00.590 --> 21:02.689
But why capture us in the first place?

21:02.725 --> 21:03.727
Why us?

21:06.029 --> 21:07.794
- What?
- Kidnapped, drugged,

21:07.830 --> 21:09.130
and disappeared to another country?

21:09.166 --> 21:10.698
This has CIA written all over it.

21:10.734 --> 21:12.733
- You think we did this?
- Either you or somebody

21:12.769 --> 21:14.602
you pissed off during one
of your sketchy-ass ops.

21:14.638 --> 21:16.102
They kidnapped all three of us, genius.

21:16.138 --> 21:17.837
You think that's a coincidence?

21:17.873 --> 21:20.474
No, this clearly has something
to do with our time at the FBI.

21:20.510 --> 21:22.743
- I don't know what you're trying to insinuate here...
- Okay, okay.

21:22.779 --> 21:24.544
We can figure out whose fault this was

21:24.580 --> 21:26.783
once we all get out of here.

21:35.625 --> 21:37.624
Break into the safe.

21:37.660 --> 21:39.860
- Sorry, what?
- Break into the safe...

21:39.896 --> 21:41.661
or die.

21:41.697 --> 21:43.863
Your time starts now.

22:14.731 --> 22:16.764
The Duke is running late.

22:16.800 --> 22:19.669
Make yourself comfortable.

22:21.571 --> 22:22.969
We can't open this.

22:23.005 --> 22:25.906
I mean, it's actually a stock embassy safe.

22:25.942 --> 22:27.874
So it's on the easier side of crackable.

22:27.910 --> 22:29.243
Not easy, but you know...

22:29.279 --> 22:30.811
I'm talking about protocol, Patterson.

22:30.847 --> 22:32.545
We're officers of the
United States government.

22:32.581 --> 22:34.481
We don't negotiate with terrorists, period.

22:34.517 --> 22:36.550
You gotta stop seeing
things so black and white.

22:36.586 --> 22:39.719
- Actually, I don't.
- Do you want a moral victory

22:39.755 --> 22:41.255
or do you want to get us out of here?

22:41.291 --> 22:43.690
'Cause if we don't open this,
they're gonna put us down.

22:43.726 --> 22:45.226
We don't know what's in it.

22:45.262 --> 22:46.960
Opening it might put more lives at risk.

22:46.996 --> 22:49.830
Now that might not bother you,
but it sure as hell bothers me.

22:49.866 --> 22:51.532
Okay, you think just because I'm CIA now,

22:51.568 --> 22:52.699
I don't care about saving lives?

22:52.735 --> 22:53.967
Stop! Just stop already.

22:54.003 --> 22:57.237
This isn't about the
safe and you both know it.

22:57.273 --> 22:59.073
You're mad 'cause she left for the CIA,

22:59.109 --> 23:01.976
and you're mad 'cause
he ghosted when you did.

23:02.012 --> 23:05.079
Guys, it was different
after Weller and Jane left.

23:05.115 --> 23:08.181
We all felt it and we all
dealt with it in our own way.

23:08.217 --> 23:10.117
You're not angry with each other,

23:10.153 --> 23:11.651
you missed each other.

23:11.687 --> 23:14.988
I sure as hell know I missed you guys, too.

23:15.024 --> 23:17.525
Reade, Zapata's right.

23:17.561 --> 23:20.527
We do nothing, they kill us,

23:20.563 --> 23:22.295
and they probably just find someone else

23:22.331 --> 23:23.764
who can open this thing.

23:23.800 --> 23:25.565
We need to make some progress here.

23:25.601 --> 23:28.235
Buy enough time to come
up with an escape plan.

23:28.271 --> 23:31.041
Are you two with me or not?

23:34.176 --> 23:35.846
What do you need?

23:40.649 --> 23:42.583
You can tell the Duke I'm sick of waiting.

23:45.321 --> 23:47.787
My sincerest apologies, I confess

23:47.823 --> 23:50.557
I was absolutely captivated by

23:50.593 --> 23:52.325
one of those glass blowers.

23:52.361 --> 23:54.093
A tourist trap, to be sure.

23:54.129 --> 23:57.064
But the man working there?

23:57.100 --> 23:59.166
Indisputably a genius.

23:59.202 --> 24:02.702
Look. Isn't it breathtaking?

24:02.738 --> 24:04.674
It's exquisite. So can we do this now?

24:32.836 --> 24:36.704
Well, it appears
congratulations are in order.

24:36.740 --> 24:39.038
I was beginning to think
no one would ever deliver

24:39.074 --> 24:41.744
the elusive Jane Doe.

24:43.079 --> 24:48.082
Pity, seems a shame to destroy

24:48.118 --> 24:50.217
something so singular.

24:50.253 --> 24:52.285
Need a hand getting the body to the boat?

24:52.321 --> 24:55.889
Mmm, no, no, that won't be necessary.

24:55.925 --> 24:58.092
There is an old
crematorium on the premises.

24:58.128 --> 25:01.064
We'll burn the body right here.

25:05.138 --> 25:07.354
Gentlemen, if you'd be so kind

25:07.390 --> 25:09.556
as to bring the body around the back.

25:09.592 --> 25:11.624
The fire should be nice and hot by now.

25:12.892 --> 25:15.976
Oh, hang on. I forgot something.

25:16.012 --> 25:19.746
You've been paid, your services rendered.

25:19.782 --> 25:22.749
Jane Doe belongs to me now.

25:22.785 --> 25:25.221
Fine, have it your way.

26:19.208 --> 26:21.941
Okay, I cannot believe that that worked.

26:21.977 --> 26:23.811
My dark web sources confirm it...

26:23.847 --> 26:26.080
the bounty's been lifted
and Jane is free and clear.

26:26.116 --> 26:28.181
What about Roman's phone?
You unlocked it yet?

26:28.217 --> 26:30.150
Actually, yes, I have. It
took a little doing b...

26:30.186 --> 26:32.820
Yes, but young Stuart was able to crack

26:32.856 --> 26:35.354
the phone's surprisingly simple
encryption, and good news!

26:35.390 --> 26:36.989
Roman was telling the truth!

26:37.025 --> 26:38.992
He sold Patterson, Reade,
and Zapata into slavery.

26:39.028 --> 26:40.460
I don't know why I said that's good news,

26:40.496 --> 26:41.728
that's obviously terrible news.

26:41.764 --> 26:43.162
So who bought them?

26:43.198 --> 26:44.931
Oh, well that's virtually
impossible to figure out.

26:44.967 --> 26:47.034
Which makes it all the
more impressive that I have.

26:47.070 --> 26:48.802
- <i>Rich...</i>
- See, first I had to

26:48.838 --> 26:50.237
figure out where the
auction was taking place

26:50.273 --> 26:52.305
and then figure out who won
by eliminating who lost...

26:52.341 --> 26:54.108
He's worse than Patterson.
Just tell us where they are.

26:54.144 --> 26:56.442
The Venezuelan government has them.

26:56.478 --> 26:59.278
Yes, and if my intel is correct,

26:59.314 --> 27:01.782
they're being held in a
military training facility

27:01.818 --> 27:03.851
somewhere near the base
of the Caroni River.

27:03.887 --> 27:05.218
<i>Unfortunately, our relationship</i>

27:05.254 --> 27:07.019
with Venezuela being what it is,

27:07.055 --> 27:09.256
there'll be zero assistance on their end.

27:09.292 --> 27:10.823
Which is why she called me.

27:10.859 --> 27:12.493
<i>I know a group of
rebels that'll meet you</i>

27:12.529 --> 27:14.794
<i>at an airstrip about three
clicks from the base.</i>

27:14.830 --> 27:16.095
<i>They'll get you all
the gear you need,</i>

27:16.131 --> 27:18.231
but you have to infiltrate
the compound on your own.

27:18.267 --> 27:21.834
Shouldn't we just call
the President or something?

27:21.870 --> 27:23.469
If we get caught sneaking FBI

27:23.505 --> 27:25.104
into a non-extradition country,

27:25.140 --> 27:27.173
it can spark an international incident.

27:27.209 --> 27:29.243
They bought our friends,

27:29.279 --> 27:32.179
enslaved them under God
knows what conditions.

27:32.215 --> 27:35.448
I'll do whatever I have
to to get them back.

27:35.484 --> 27:38.852
These things are terrible.

27:38.888 --> 27:40.853
Really? I actually kind of like mine.

27:40.889 --> 27:42.922
Which one did you have?

27:42.958 --> 27:45.492
Mexican-style chicken stew.

27:45.528 --> 27:48.394
- You?
- Mexican-style chicken stew.

27:48.430 --> 27:50.531
Do you wanna finish mine?

27:50.567 --> 27:53.132
Which one did you have?

27:53.168 --> 27:56.269
Mexican-style chicken stew.

27:56.305 --> 27:57.170
Ah, thanks.

27:57.206 --> 27:58.839
Maybe we'll get lucky and they'll kill us

27:58.875 --> 28:00.006
before breakfast.

28:00.042 --> 28:01.307
How's that safe coming, Patterson?

28:01.343 --> 28:02.845
Wait for it.

28:15.591 --> 28:18.257
This code here.

28:18.293 --> 28:20.294
This is CIA.

28:20.330 --> 28:22.262
We gotta destroy it. If they
get their hands on this...

28:26.936 --> 28:29.005
I think they just did.

28:33.176 --> 28:35.846
We're landing in five minutes.

28:39.381 --> 28:41.180
We will get them back.

28:41.216 --> 28:45.052
- And then what?
- What do you mean?

28:45.088 --> 28:47.987
We just gonna go back to how it was?

28:48.023 --> 28:51.925
Well, with these new tattoos,

28:51.961 --> 28:54.061
I'm guessing they're probably gonna want us

28:54.097 --> 28:55.996
to move back to New York.

28:56.032 --> 28:59.233
As far as you and me, yeah.

28:59.269 --> 29:02.236
I was hoping it goes back to how it was.

29:02.272 --> 29:06.939
Leaving you and the life
we had together was...

29:06.975 --> 29:09.543
the hardest thing I've ever done.

29:09.579 --> 29:11.044
But?

29:11.080 --> 29:14.981
But once I was gone...

29:15.017 --> 29:18.485
There were some parts
of me that woke up again.

29:18.521 --> 29:21.621
Parts of me I didn't even
realize I was missing.

29:21.657 --> 29:24.291
Life in Colorado was amazing.

29:24.327 --> 29:28.262
I had you, I had peace.

29:28.298 --> 29:31.364
I just... I didn't have a purpose.

29:31.400 --> 29:36.236
Some way of defining myself outside of you.

29:36.272 --> 29:38.138
Outside of us.

29:38.174 --> 29:42.879
And you found that? Out there?

29:47.550 --> 29:49.887
So what do you want now?

29:54.590 --> 29:57.224
I want whatever's inside this.

29:57.260 --> 30:00.393
The data on that thing is
for sure mega-encrypted.

30:00.429 --> 30:03.996
I couldn't hack it even if I had months.

30:04.032 --> 30:05.165
No, we paid for the best

30:05.201 --> 30:07.566
computer specialist in the FBI.

30:07.602 --> 30:09.635
But she hasn't worked for
the Bureau in over a year.

30:09.671 --> 30:11.271
Yeah, I make video game apps, man,

30:11.307 --> 30:12.605
I'm not up to date on this stuff.

30:12.641 --> 30:14.307
I don't believe you.

30:14.343 --> 30:16.342
Well, I don't know what to tell you.

30:16.378 --> 30:17.410
That you will do it.

30:17.446 --> 30:19.345
Wait, if this is just
about hacking a computer,

30:19.381 --> 30:22.548
- what do you need us for?
- To kill if she refuses.

30:22.584 --> 30:24.985
You have six hours.

30:25.021 --> 30:27.153
And then I come back

30:27.189 --> 30:29.389
and I'll start killing your friends.

30:29.425 --> 30:31.091
Then six hours after that,

30:31.127 --> 30:34.093
I'll finish killing them.

30:34.129 --> 30:37.397
I suggest you give me what I ask for.

30:44.707 --> 30:46.635
I might have an idea.

30:46.671 --> 30:48.791
But it's just like, a little bit crazy.

30:48.827 --> 30:50.477
Crazier than getting killed in six hours?

30:50.513 --> 30:53.346
Well, it involves
Mexican-style chicken stew.

30:53.382 --> 30:55.484
Oh, great, so "all the way" crazy.

31:00.590 --> 31:03.189
MRE. "Meals Ready to Eat,"

31:03.225 --> 31:05.359
as in "Hot... and Ready to Eat."

31:05.395 --> 31:07.627
Made for soldiers with no stove

31:07.663 --> 31:09.095
and no fire.

31:09.131 --> 31:10.330
And apparently no taste buds.

31:10.366 --> 31:13.033
Every meal comes with a packet

31:13.069 --> 31:15.267
of magnesium heater power.

31:15.303 --> 31:18.471
Just add water, and
this stuff gets real hot.

31:18.507 --> 31:20.707
Does anyone care to guess what the primary

31:20.743 --> 31:23.744
explosive component of flash bangs is?

31:23.780 --> 31:25.983
- Magnesium powder.
- Magnesium powder.

31:28.517 --> 31:31.752
This CIA desktop is liquid cooled.

31:31.788 --> 31:33.452
We just add a bunch of this stuff...

31:33.488 --> 31:35.389
And make the world's biggest flash bang.

31:35.425 --> 31:37.157
Distract the guards, overpower 'em,

31:37.193 --> 31:39.558
take the weapons... it's not bad.

31:39.594 --> 31:41.727
I think someone owes

31:41.763 --> 31:44.400
Mexican-style chicken stew an apology.

31:59.282 --> 32:00.479
We got a lot of ground to cover.

32:00.515 --> 32:01.814
We have seven hours 'til daylight,

32:01.850 --> 32:03.283
we'll have to go a building at a time.

32:03.319 --> 32:05.384
- Let's try and do it quietly.
- Yep.

32:08.858 --> 32:10.657
Why is it off?

32:10.693 --> 32:12.258
It's a slight overheating issue.

32:12.294 --> 32:14.260
Do you want me to boot it up for you?

32:14.296 --> 32:16.165
Okay.

32:42.558 --> 32:43.790
I think we found them.

32:43.826 --> 32:45.358
So much for quiet.

32:45.394 --> 32:48.665
I have an idea.

32:56.705 --> 32:57.804
Now what?

33:09.819 --> 33:11.421
This isn't good.

33:21.230 --> 33:22.795
Okay, okay.

33:22.831 --> 33:27.270
We give up. Don't shoot.

33:37.879 --> 33:39.211
Team!

33:39.247 --> 33:41.214
- Weller?
- Get in!

33:41.250 --> 33:42.481
I'll explain later.

33:46.856 --> 33:49.855
Okay, come on down.

33:49.891 --> 33:52.625
Jane? You're back?

33:52.661 --> 33:54.227
What the hell is going on?

33:54.263 --> 33:55.762
We gotta get out of here fast.

33:55.798 --> 33:57.229
Fast is not a tank's specialty,

33:57.265 --> 33:58.497
and we're nearly out of ammo.

34:15.585 --> 34:18.384
Oh, man, I gotta buy me one of these.

34:18.420 --> 34:21.420
So there's a tunnel system
on the south side of us.

34:21.456 --> 34:22.621
That should get us through the mountains.

34:22.657 --> 34:25.529
What's to stop them from following?

34:27.295 --> 34:29.299
I don't like those smiles.

34:38.808 --> 34:42.475
- That is what stops 'em.
- Not bad.

34:42.511 --> 34:44.444
Okay, seriously, though,
what the hell is going on?

34:44.480 --> 34:46.745
- Yeah, and where are we?
- And how did you find us?

34:46.781 --> 34:48.281
And where have you been?

34:48.317 --> 34:51.317
It's... a long story.

34:51.353 --> 34:54.654
Well, damn it, we got time.
This tank is slow as hell.

35:03.732 --> 35:06.533
This new layer of tattoos
is even more complex

35:06.569 --> 35:08.000
and dense than the first one.

35:08.036 --> 35:10.270
Hidden letters, unknown patterns

35:10.306 --> 35:11.437
and number sequences,

35:11.473 --> 35:12.939
maps without labels or context.

35:12.975 --> 35:16.275
It appears that every
inch of new ink on Miss Doe

35:16.311 --> 35:17.844
contains hidden meanings.

35:17.880 --> 35:20.846
And I think the CIA should run
the investigation this time.

35:20.882 --> 35:23.683
Shocking! And why is that?

35:23.719 --> 35:26.920
Because we narrowly avoided
a major national disaster

35:26.956 --> 35:28.487
when the FBI ran it last time.

35:28.523 --> 35:30.589
We didn't avoid it, we stopped it.

35:30.625 --> 35:32.792
Besides, the CIA can't operate domest...

35:32.828 --> 35:35.361
Domestically? So far
this case has been glob...

35:35.397 --> 35:37.330
All right, all right, look! Look!

35:37.366 --> 35:40.466
The reality is we need to
work together on this one.

35:40.502 --> 35:43.870
Hear me out. This thing is
plenty big for the both of us,

35:43.906 --> 35:45.739
so I propose a joint task force.

35:45.775 --> 35:47.007
- Come on!
- We... We...

35:47.043 --> 35:48.507
Listen, listen, listen.

35:48.543 --> 35:50.042
Our best chance at neutralizing

35:50.078 --> 35:51.478
whatever this new threat is out there

35:51.514 --> 35:53.013
lies in pooling our resources.

35:53.049 --> 35:54.346
We might not like it,

35:54.382 --> 35:55.614
but tell me I'm wrong.

35:55.650 --> 35:57.549
Is this about solving Jane's new tattoos

35:57.585 --> 35:59.522
or about you getting your old partner back?

36:02.792 --> 36:04.957
You run the CIA side, right?

36:04.993 --> 36:06.859
Assign whatever agent you think best.

36:06.895 --> 36:09.732
I suggest someone with some
experience on the matter.

36:11.100 --> 36:12.766
- That work for you?
- If you think

36:12.802 --> 36:15.035
this is the right call, I'll support you.

36:15.071 --> 36:16.969
But I will also hold you accountable

36:17.005 --> 36:20.342
if this blows up in your face.

36:23.011 --> 36:25.411
Okay, so we're gonna form...

36:25.447 --> 36:26.612
A joint task force.

36:26.648 --> 36:28.515
Solve the new tattoos and go after Roman.

36:28.551 --> 36:31.051
Yeah. Now, I can't force
you guys to join but...

36:31.087 --> 36:32.822
- I'm in.
- Me, too.

36:35.357 --> 36:36.756
I have a lot of people counting on me

36:36.792 --> 36:38.625
- back in California.
- Come on, Patterson.

36:38.661 --> 36:40.359
You know I'll reinstate you in a heartbeat.

36:43.833 --> 36:47.067
I will help you get set
up, but after that I'm gone.

36:47.103 --> 36:48.600
That's fine. We'll take it.

36:48.636 --> 36:50.402
All right, let's do it.
Jane's waiting on us.

36:50.438 --> 36:51.904
Richard's gonna brief us in Stuart's lab.

36:51.940 --> 36:55.641
Uh, Stuart's lab? Since wh...
Wait, did you just say Rich?

36:55.677 --> 36:58.678
- Okay, so...
- I'm sorry, I know I've been gone for a minute.

36:58.714 --> 37:01.413
But are we really letting Rich Dotcom,

37:01.449 --> 37:03.549
dark web super villain, have access to

37:03.585 --> 37:06.018
- FBI computer systems now?
- Hey, Peppermint Patty,

37:06.054 --> 37:07.520
I'm a changed man, 'kay?

37:07.556 --> 37:09.689
Rich is currently on probation,

37:09.725 --> 37:12.591
working with us on sort
of a work-release program.

37:12.627 --> 37:14.594
- Full release.
- The truth is,

37:14.630 --> 37:16.929
he's got a lot to offer,
and over the past year,

37:16.965 --> 37:18.598
he's actually done a lot to earn our trust.

37:18.634 --> 37:21.600
You see that? That's
leadership right there.

37:21.636 --> 37:23.803
Is... Is there a briefing
somewhere inside this briefing?

37:23.839 --> 37:26.373
I... Okay, these monitors,
they're all wrong.

37:26.409 --> 37:27.806
Can you not lean on the counters, please?

37:27.842 --> 37:29.576
We're not really doing that anymore.

37:29.612 --> 37:32.078
Thank you. Okay, so, Jane's new tattoos

37:32.114 --> 37:35.047
are a bit of a mindcuss,
if you'll pardon my French.

37:35.083 --> 37:36.482
It's very different this time.

37:36.518 --> 37:38.118
The new layers also seem to interact

37:38.154 --> 37:41.754
with the original tattoos like
some giant game of 3-D chess.

37:41.790 --> 37:45.091
- With puzzles.
- It's gonna take a bit of time to crack.

37:45.127 --> 37:46.658
Yeah, well, for you, maybe.

37:46.694 --> 37:49.462
I thought you were just
helping us get started.

37:49.498 --> 37:51.131
Oh, I'm in. I mean, there's no way

37:51.167 --> 37:53.399
that I'm leaving this to Rich and Stuart.

37:53.435 --> 37:54.833
No offense, Stuart.

37:54.869 --> 37:56.870
No, I mean, why would I take
offense? Five years of co...

37:56.906 --> 37:58.471
I'm still stuck on why.

37:58.507 --> 38:00.507
We don't know Roman's motives yet

38:00.543 --> 38:01.908
because he doesn't want us to.

38:01.944 --> 38:04.743
The only way to figure it out
is to follow these tattoos.

38:04.779 --> 38:06.612
Jane, you don't have to do this

38:06.648 --> 38:07.913
if you don't want to.

38:07.949 --> 38:10.149
No one is forcing you to be here this time.

38:10.185 --> 38:12.118
Yes, they are.

38:12.154 --> 38:13.920
Roman knows I can't walk away from this.

38:13.956 --> 38:17.824
He's my brother, these
tattoos are on my body.

38:17.860 --> 38:19.158
I'm doing this.

38:19.194 --> 38:20.893
Backstreet's back, all right!

38:20.929 --> 38:24.163
- Six best friends and Stuart.
- You know what...

38:24.199 --> 38:26.899
Okay, okay, let's just give the brain trust

38:26.935 --> 38:28.835
some room here so they can comb through

38:28.871 --> 38:30.603
all of this and formulate a plan.

38:30.639 --> 38:32.504
I think we all have earned some rest.

38:32.540 --> 38:33.873
It's nice to see you, Jane.

38:33.909 --> 38:37.444
I'm sorry, but this all
needs to be rearranged.

38:37.480 --> 38:39.745
This has no flow. No flow.

38:48.757 --> 38:52.125
Wow. I love the new look.

38:52.161 --> 38:54.493
It's very Zen.

38:54.529 --> 38:57.797
I was about five minutes
away from selling it.

38:57.833 --> 39:00.567
Been kind of living out of
a suitcase lately, you know?

39:00.603 --> 39:02.502
I know the feeling.

39:02.538 --> 39:04.937
We can have the movers bring our stuff back

39:04.973 --> 39:06.806
from storage tomorrow.

39:06.842 --> 39:09.007
If... If you still want them to.

39:09.043 --> 39:11.678
Yeah. I want.

39:11.714 --> 39:13.879
I know how much you gave up

39:13.915 --> 39:15.647
to come with me to Colorado.

39:15.683 --> 39:18.717
I'm sorry I didn't acknowledge it sooner.

39:18.753 --> 39:22.721
If we do this, I wanna
do it right this time.

39:22.757 --> 39:27.694
And I don't know... how
we fit together anymore.

39:27.730 --> 39:29.895
But I do want to figure it out.

39:29.931 --> 39:31.634
That's all I want.

39:37.306 --> 39:39.506
You were carrying this the entire mission?

39:39.542 --> 39:41.007
Yeah.

39:41.043 --> 39:45.578
Every day since the day you left.

39:45.614 --> 39:47.814
You don't have to put
that on straight away.

39:47.850 --> 39:50.018
There's been a lot that's...

39:52.587 --> 39:54.587
I missed you so much.

39:54.623 --> 39:55.855
I missed you, too.

39:55.891 --> 39:58.690
I don't suppose the, uh, bed's still here.

39:58.726 --> 40:01.127
I'm sure we can improvise.

40:02.730 --> 40:04.830
- Hello.
- Hey.

40:04.866 --> 40:08.201
So, all of your friends
back under the same roof?

40:08.237 --> 40:11.036
How's it feel?

40:11.072 --> 40:14.140
Um, I love these guys.

40:14.176 --> 40:17.643
We know each other better
than anyone in the world.

40:17.679 --> 40:21.080
- But it... it feels different.
- It is different.

40:21.116 --> 40:22.748
You're in charge now.

40:22.784 --> 40:25.717
And you've been apart almost two years,

40:25.753 --> 40:27.587
living very different lives.

40:27.623 --> 40:29.955
So I don't doubt your
love for these people.

40:29.991 --> 40:34.997
But, Reade, you can't
assume you still know them.

40:37.665 --> 40:40.332
- Anything good? I'm starving.
- Nope.

40:40.368 --> 40:44.106
I'll go down the street,
I'll get us something.

40:45.340 --> 40:48.944
- Dosa Mahal?
- Mmm, Dosa Mahal.

40:50.112 --> 40:51.848
Bye.

40:57.953 --> 40:59.889
Hey.

41:02.657 --> 41:04.826
You see this yet?

41:09.230 --> 41:10.797
This gonna be a problem?

41:10.833 --> 41:15.171
No. Not if they don't find out.

41:17.940 --> 41:19.806
That was well-played today.

41:19.842 --> 41:23.109
Nobody suspected a thing.

41:23.145 --> 41:27.080
So, you wanna grab a
bite, our usual spot or...

41:27.116 --> 41:29.848
No. And this is the last conversation

41:29.884 --> 41:31.317
we're gonna have about this.

41:31.353 --> 41:32.819
As far as anyone here is concerned,

41:32.855 --> 41:34.353
we haven't seen each other in two years.

41:34.389 --> 41:36.154
Do you understand?

41:36.190 --> 41:37.659
Understood.

41:57.746 --> 41:59.616
Weller.

42:02.418 --> 42:05.417
Easy. Easy.

42:05.453 --> 42:07.886
- What're you doing here?
- I need a favor.

42:07.922 --> 42:09.656
Some help with the tattoos.

42:09.692 --> 42:11.056
What, are you insane?

42:12.427 --> 42:14.227
Maybe.

42:14.263 --> 42:15.962
But you are gonna help me.

42:15.998 --> 42:17.029
If I don't?

42:17.065 --> 42:19.968
I'll tell Jane what happened in Berlin.

42:26.262 --> 42:27.530
What do you need?

42:29.553 --> 42:34.553
