01:16.960 --> 01:21.636
<i>You're spending your Saturday night
listening to Oldies Radio WZ.</i>

01:21.880 --> 01:24.030
<i>Pretty pathetic, isn't it?</i>

01:24.280 --> 01:27.511
<i>Here's one you have to be
hovering around 40 to remember.</i>

01:27.760 --> 01:30.433
Then I couldn't possibly remember.

01:45.680 --> 01:47.238
Honey.

01:48.920 --> 01:50.638
Al.

01:57.480 --> 02:00.392
Oh, my God,
is it our anniversary again?

02:00.640 --> 02:01.675
No, Al.

02:01.880 --> 02:04.872
Well, then, what gives you
the right to touch me?

02:05.120 --> 02:08.351
Because I'm tired
of touching myself.

02:10.199 --> 02:12.270
Well, who could blame you?

02:13.440 --> 02:14.873
Al, I wanna talk.

02:15.120 --> 02:18.795
And I want the same attention
that you'd give one of your burps.

02:19.760 --> 02:22.638
And you think you've
earned that right?

02:23.320 --> 02:26.517
Look, honey, I know you love
your burps. We all do.

02:26.760 --> 02:30.833
But if we could just
put your gas aside, just this once.

02:36.120 --> 02:39.032
After that one, of course.

02:39.440 --> 02:43.399
Come on, Al, it's Saturday night and we
are sitting home alone, doing nothing.

02:43.640 --> 02:45.119
Didn't use to be like that.

02:45.360 --> 02:48.352
- Remember when we were young?
- No.

02:48.600 --> 02:53.754
Out every night. Living, loving,
taking big mouthfuls of life.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.991
And then we met.

02:57.360 --> 03:00.238
But we had some great times.
And we can again.

03:00.480 --> 03:02.630
Whatever we did then,
we can do now.

03:02.880 --> 03:06.714
No, we can't, Peg, because now when
we make love, I don't get to go home.

03:07.240 --> 03:09.708
Peg, you're old. Revel in it.

03:09.960 --> 03:14.317
Get yourself some Q-Tips
and burp yourself to the grave, baby.

03:15.560 --> 03:18.950
Saturday night is for the young,
not you.

03:20.080 --> 03:21.479
Oh, yeah, youth.

03:21.720 --> 03:24.757
Every kid in the world's got somewhere
to go on Saturday night.

03:27.880 --> 03:29.677
Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.

03:29.920 --> 03:32.593
You got any Popsicle sticks?
I'm building a house.

03:35.960 --> 03:40.078
Save your pity. I'm not the only boy
in this town without a date.

03:41.840 --> 03:45.594
Don't move, amigos,
this one's for me.

03:59.960 --> 04:02.394
<i>Saturday night
is the night for amore.</i>

04:06.800 --> 04:09.268
Got me an older woman.

04:17.720 --> 04:20.108
Now Bud's even more depressed.

04:20.360 --> 04:21.713
Say something to him, Al.

04:21.959 --> 04:23.439
Son...

04:23.680 --> 04:25.750
<i>...F Troop's on.</i>

04:27.680 --> 04:29.830
<i>F Troop. Of course.</i>

04:30.080 --> 04:33.834
<i>I'll have plenty of dates
once F Troop is over. Plenty, I said.</i>

04:35.920 --> 04:37.353
And by the way...

04:37.600 --> 04:40.034
...in case you're wondering why
I'm in my pyjamas...

04:40.280 --> 04:43.829
...I wear them under my clothes so I'm
ready when a chick wants to go to bed.

04:48.440 --> 04:49.793
They know you're lying.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.558
No, they don't.

04:51.760 --> 04:53.830
Just stay cool.

04:55.120 --> 04:56.838
I don't think we can pull this off.

04:57.040 --> 04:58.792
Yes, we can.

04:59.320 --> 05:03.279
We've got them fooled.
We've got everybody fooled.

05:03.840 --> 05:05.273
Are you sure?

05:05.480 --> 05:08.916
What's the difference?
We still have each other.

05:13.720 --> 05:14.948
Al, we have to do something.

05:15.160 --> 05:18.118
There's nothing to do except
pick out the dress you wanna wear...

05:18.360 --> 05:21.272
...when Dan Rather asks you
why your son shot the president.

05:24.360 --> 05:28.478
I am talking about us.
We have to improve our social life.

05:28.720 --> 05:30.438
And I have the answers right here.

05:31.360 --> 05:35.478
Now, Peg, those weren't the answers
since they stood up by themselves.

05:37.400 --> 05:39.914
They're not alone in that,
you know.

05:40.960 --> 05:42.871
<i>Look, I just bought
the new issue of Cosmo.</i>

05:43.120 --> 05:45.270
Oh, now, Peg. No, now.

05:45.520 --> 05:48.830
Look here, those articles about married
couples having sex every month...

05:49.080 --> 05:51.355
...that's just a bunch
of sensationalistic-

05:51.600 --> 05:53.556
Just a bunch of
sensationalistic lies...

05:53.800 --> 05:55.870
...perpetrated on the public
to sell magazines.

05:56.080 --> 05:58.116
It's just a bunch of hooey,
that's all. Hooey!

05:58.360 --> 06:01.432
- No normal man could-
- Oh, relax, Al.

06:01.640 --> 06:03.551
I'm not talking about sex.

06:08.680 --> 06:10.830
<i>Honey, look, there's an article here:</i>

06:11.080 --> 06:13.913
" Is your marriage dead?
Talk it alive. "

06:14.160 --> 06:16.628
This says that we should talk
every Saturday night.

06:16.880 --> 06:19.110
And that's what we're gonna do.
Starting tonight.

06:19.320 --> 06:22.471
Now, we had plenty to talk about
when we first met.

06:22.720 --> 06:24.517
Peg, that was before
I got to know you.

06:24.720 --> 06:27.518
There was a lot of things
I had to find out, you know.

06:27.760 --> 06:29.034
<i>There was stuff like:</i>

06:29.240 --> 06:31.913
<i>" How far will she really go
on a six-pack?" And, you know:</i>

06:33.120 --> 06:36.669
"Would it be any fun for you
to watch me and your friend Joan?

06:38.960 --> 06:42.919
<i>Did she actually see Deep Throat?"
You know...</i>

06:43.120 --> 06:45.793
<i>Yeah, and there was that thing
that I always kept wondering:</i>

06:46.000 --> 06:50.437
" How could a man with such big feet
have such a teeny-weeny, tiny, little...

06:50.680 --> 06:52.352
- ... itsy-?"
- Peg.

06:55.440 --> 06:57.317
Brain, honey.

06:57.560 --> 07:00.393
Oh, come on, Al. Let's talk.

07:00.640 --> 07:02.756
Fine. We'll talk.

07:09.280 --> 07:12.477
Don't you dare. We are talking here.

07:12.680 --> 07:15.399
<i>I refuse to talk to my wife when I have
a TV in the house.</i>

07:15.600 --> 07:19.354
Al, I wanna talk. Talk to me!

07:28.680 --> 07:30.989
I'm out of gas.

07:32.760 --> 07:36.196
Aren't you supposed to
turn the car off before you say that?

07:37.640 --> 07:38.993
Well, what's the difference?

07:39.200 --> 07:42.158
I mean, we both know
I'm not out of gas.

07:42.400 --> 07:45.790
Oh, very nice. Now we both do.

07:49.440 --> 07:51.237
God, I hate women.

07:51.440 --> 07:52.839
All right.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.070
I'm out of gas.

07:56.320 --> 07:57.912
For real?

07:59.800 --> 08:01.438
Yeah.

08:03.080 --> 08:05.548
What a coinkydink, huh?

08:07.680 --> 08:08.908
Come here.

08:09.120 --> 08:12.157
- Don't you wanna talk first?
- No.

08:12.400 --> 08:15.233
If I wanted to talk,
I'd be hanging out with the guys.

08:15.480 --> 08:17.869
And I wouldn't have had to shave.

08:18.600 --> 08:21.114
- Come here.
- Come here?

08:21.360 --> 08:23.476
If I wanted to listen
to one-word sentences...

08:23.720 --> 08:27.349
...I would have been out with the girls,
and I wouldn't have had to shave.

08:28.280 --> 08:33.115
You know, Kelly, I'm sure there's
a lot more to you than meets the eye.

08:33.360 --> 08:36.193
Unfortunately, I don't really care
about that part.

08:36.400 --> 08:41.554
So why don't you just
put out or get out.

08:41.760 --> 08:43.591
Okay?

08:43.840 --> 08:46.752
Well, a girl's gotta do
what a girl's gotta do, huh?

08:47.000 --> 08:48.752
Exactly.

08:57.600 --> 09:00.068
It was good for me,
was it good for you?

09:00.680 --> 09:03.990
Have a nice walk home, tramp.

09:08.960 --> 09:10.188
Tramp?

09:10.440 --> 09:12.556
But I got out.

09:22.600 --> 09:24.033
Oh, no.

09:31.760 --> 09:38.108
Left, right, left, right,
left, right, right, right.

09:39.040 --> 09:40.951
I must have forgotten
a left somewhere.

09:41.200 --> 09:44.590
Oh, God, this walk
has totally "discumboobled" me.

09:44.840 --> 09:48.276
But as I learned long ago,
it doesn't matter where you walk...

09:48.480 --> 09:52.075
...just as long as you don't walk
and chew gum at the same time.

09:55.560 --> 09:59.109
Left, right, left, right-
God, it's so much easier.

09:59.320 --> 10:01.595
Look at me go.
- left, right.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.197
Fourteen miles? It was 15 before.

10:06.440 --> 10:08.635
It's just getting less.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.558
Oh, doody.

10:10.800 --> 10:12.756
Left, right, left, right...

10:18.600 --> 10:20.750
Goes the owl.

10:22.200 --> 10:24.395
Goes the cow.

10:30.160 --> 10:33.197
Goes the girl with the ride home.

10:35.440 --> 10:38.432
So we've certainly learned
a lot about each other.

10:38.680 --> 10:43.196
We have no opinions on
politics, religion, science...

10:43.440 --> 10:48.719
...starving people, nuclear holocaust
or recycling.

10:48.960 --> 10:51.315
The only thing that we seem
to feel strongly about...

10:51.560 --> 10:54.757
...is we both hate that painting
behind Jay Leno.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.797
- I do hate that painting.
- It's terrible.

10:57.040 --> 11:00.828
- I don't know why they put it there.
- I don't know why they put it there.

11:01.080 --> 11:04.993
Well, now that we've broken the ice,
let's talk about us.

11:08.480 --> 11:09.959
Yes!

11:10.520 --> 11:13.080
Mommy, Daddy, I did it.

11:13.320 --> 11:16.392
I did it. I got a date.

11:25.520 --> 11:28.557
Yup, no more sticky fingers for me.

11:35.240 --> 11:37.959
You know, from the Popsicle sticks.

11:43.760 --> 11:45.910
Anyhow, I called
every girl in college...

11:46.160 --> 11:48.720
...and when I got to the most
beautiful girl in school...

11:48.920 --> 11:52.993
...she's the one who said, "Thank you,
Bud. Please, please take me out. "

11:53.240 --> 11:55.435
So I guess I got something
special after all.

11:55.680 --> 11:58.353
So where's a good place to take a girl
with the measles?

11:59.720 --> 12:03.474
You know, son,
you're a mighty strange young fella.

12:04.720 --> 12:06.233
Maybe so, maybe so...

12:06.480 --> 12:09.119
...but a strange young fella
with a date.

12:11.640 --> 12:13.551
I know she's got a fever now...

12:13.800 --> 12:18.237
...but wait till she feels the relief from a
cool, long-necked Bud against her head.

12:24.160 --> 12:27.436
Peg, I'm beginning to think the kid
might have a problem or two.

12:27.680 --> 12:32.390
Yes, but we don't have the right kind
of training or concern to handle it.

12:32.640 --> 12:34.039
So, Al, tell me...

12:34.280 --> 12:36.236
...what do you talk about
with your friends?

12:36.440 --> 12:38.192
You can talk about
those things with me.

12:38.440 --> 12:41.830
Well, Peg, I don't talk to my friends.
You don't let me have any.

12:42.480 --> 12:44.630
I don't talk to anybody.
I'm just not a talker.

12:44.840 --> 12:47.798
It's not you, Peg,
it's just the way I am.

12:48.520 --> 12:51.080
- Hey, Al.
- Jefferson, Jefferson, Jefferson...

12:51.280 --> 12:52.554
- ... how you doing?
- All right.

12:52.760 --> 12:54.318
- You see the Bears game?
- Sure did.

12:54.520 --> 12:56.715
Hey, you think Perot's
gonna be back in '96?

12:56.960 --> 12:59.554
Not a chance.
Doesn't talk issues, my man.

12:59.800 --> 13:01.597
Oh, remind me to give you back
that book.

13:01.840 --> 13:03.717
As you said it,
ending was anti-climatic...

13:03.920 --> 13:07.071
...but the read getting there was
frankly compelling.

13:08.280 --> 13:10.157
I got that camera
that you recommended...

13:10.400 --> 13:12.755
...and the f/1.2 lens was worth
the extra money.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.389
Well, the faster the lens,
the more light you can use.

13:15.640 --> 13:17.631
Did you know
that Pavarotti is back in town?

13:17.840 --> 13:19.831
Hey!

13:21.000 --> 13:23.309
You got a brain
that you're not using with me?

13:23.560 --> 13:26.791
That makes two things
you're not using with me.

13:28.920 --> 13:31.832
Come on, Al, it's not like
I wanna be your friend or anything...

13:32.080 --> 13:34.514
...I just want you to talk to me.

13:34.760 --> 13:37.274
Communication problem, eh?

13:37.520 --> 13:39.317
That started to happen to us.

13:39.520 --> 13:43.308
<i>That is, until we read Cosmo's
wonderful, penetrating article:</i>

13:43.560 --> 13:46.358
" Is Your Marriage Dead?
Talk It Alive. "

13:46.560 --> 13:48.357
It certainly helped Jefferson.

13:48.600 --> 13:52.798
I didn't need any help, because I'm
naturally perky and quite fascinating.

13:54.040 --> 13:55.758
<i>Actually, I don't really need Cosmo...</i>

13:55.960 --> 13:57.473
...but poor Jefferson does.

13:57.720 --> 14:02.510
Honey, tell everyone how that article
on temporary male impotence...

14:02.760 --> 14:06.958
...has given you the courage
to try, try again.

14:07.200 --> 14:08.997
<i>You should see him.
He's so cute going:</i>

14:09.200 --> 14:12.078
" I think I can, I think I can,
I think I can. "

14:17.400 --> 14:19.118
Of course, that's after four times...

14:19.360 --> 14:22.318
...of making her shake
like a California quake.

14:28.680 --> 14:32.798
And like Los Angeles,
I'm still waiting for the big one.

14:37.880 --> 14:40.872
Well, I'd settle for an aftershock.

14:44.960 --> 14:48.157
- Oh, you should see Al.
- No, I shouldn't.

14:49.520 --> 14:53.274
Oh, snookums,
it's kind of cute, though.

14:53.520 --> 14:56.637
It's like Groundhogs Day,
peeking out...

14:56.920 --> 15:01.436
...seeing its own shadow,
getting scared and running away.

15:03.320 --> 15:05.959
Not the shadow
it's scared of, Peg.

15:07.920 --> 15:09.831
Cute as the dickens, though.

15:10.080 --> 15:15.438
Yeah, well, not as cute
as my little Bermuda Triangle.

15:17.560 --> 15:19.869
Al, are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

15:20.120 --> 15:22.315
Oh, I just might be.

15:22.560 --> 15:26.553
This talk stuff doesn't work for us.
Let's go upstairs.

15:26.800 --> 15:30.156
<i>That doesn't work either, but it's quick
and we can get back and watch TV.</i>

15:30.360 --> 15:31.952
- Oh, Al.
- You said it, baby!

15:38.280 --> 15:44.196
But you know, Al, it is Saturday night,
so I must insist on foreplay.

15:44.440 --> 15:45.839
<i>Oh, all right. Here you go:</i>

15:46.040 --> 15:48.235
Goose, goose, goose.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.912
Well, you think we ought to
go home and do it?

15:58.800 --> 16:02.110
Make yourselves some coffee,
we'll be back in a second.

16:02.320 --> 16:06.199
Come on, Peg,
I'm rounding third, baby!

16:06.520 --> 16:08.397
Gotta go!

16:09.520 --> 16:13.752
<i>Eighty-nine bottles of beer on the wall
Eighty-nine bottles of beer</i>

16:14.000 --> 16:17.629
<i>If one of those bottles
Should happen to fall</i>

16:19.480 --> 16:21.994
<i>Eighty-ten bottles of beer on the wall</i>

16:26.360 --> 16:27.952
Hey.

16:32.200 --> 16:33.553
What are you guys doing?

16:33.800 --> 16:38.157
We have been by this deer crossing
forever, but one hasn't come yet.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.513
Maybe we should just go.

16:44.520 --> 16:46.033
No. Don't.

16:46.280 --> 16:48.475
It could be a trap.

16:48.720 --> 16:53.032
We could start to cross, and then a cop
will throw a deer out here...

16:53.280 --> 16:57.068
...and then we'll all be in the pokey
sharing a cell with Mike Tyson.

16:59.160 --> 17:01.310
So, what are you guys doing here?

17:01.560 --> 17:06.509
Are you a " Car Broken Down"? CBD.
Or a " Put Out or Get Out"? POOGO.

17:06.800 --> 17:08.994
- POOGO.
- POOGO.

17:09.240 --> 17:12.915
Yeah, I guess that makes us
the three POOGO-teers.

17:13.160 --> 17:14.912
Athos, Porthos and Moe.

17:16.760 --> 17:18.272
Who are they?

17:20.079 --> 17:23.435
They're these guys from this book
based on the candy bar.

17:26.040 --> 17:29.271
Well, we could wait here forever
for a stupid deer to cross...

17:29.480 --> 17:31.675
...but I guess we should do
the sensible thing.

17:31.880 --> 17:34.314
Let's sit down and wait. Okay?

17:38.080 --> 17:41.993
<i>This road brings back memories
of my old boyfriend Tony DiVitteto.</i>

17:42.600 --> 17:46.878
- Did you use to come here with him?
- No. Why would you think that?

17:55.160 --> 17:57.116
Tramps.

17:58.160 --> 18:01.311
Hey wait, officer,
we need a ride home.

18:03.200 --> 18:04.679
Damn.

18:04.960 --> 18:07.030
Who does he think he is,
calling us tramps?

18:07.280 --> 18:09.271
Yeah. I resent that.

18:09.520 --> 18:13.274
I mean, must a girl wear underwear
to get respect in this town?

18:13.520 --> 18:15.476
I mean, why do men call us tramps?

18:15.720 --> 18:17.233
Because they're morons.

18:17.480 --> 18:19.675
I mean, men are the real tramps.

18:19.920 --> 18:22.992
They'll do it for anyone,
any time, any place.

18:26.680 --> 18:30.036
For instance, I was walking home from
a date through the cemetery...

18:30.280 --> 18:32.874
<i>...and I heard these people wailing:</i>

18:33.120 --> 18:34.712
"Oh, Grandpa. Oh, Grandpa. "

18:34.960 --> 18:36.791
And everybody's weeping
and everything.

18:37.040 --> 18:38.473
<i>And then I hear this guy go:</i>

18:38.720 --> 18:40.790
" Hooters at 5 o'clock. "

18:42.440 --> 18:44.670
And so everyone turns
to look at me...

18:44.920 --> 18:49.869
...the pallbearers drop the casket,
Grandpa's head comes rolling out-

18:51.000 --> 18:53.195
It was a railroad accident.

18:54.680 --> 18:57.148
<i>- and men from the funeral
come running up to me going:</i>

18:57.400 --> 19:00.949
"God, I love Grandpa.
Let's do it in his casket. "

19:01.560 --> 19:03.516
Men are tramps.

19:03.720 --> 19:04.914
Yeah, they sure are.

19:05.120 --> 19:08.908
And we do not, as rumoured,
spend our lives on our backs.

19:09.640 --> 19:12.518
Hey, isn't that
the constellation Orion?

19:12.760 --> 19:15.558
I can't tell. Wait a second.

19:18.320 --> 19:20.231
Yup, it is.

19:20.440 --> 19:21.953
Pretty.

19:22.840 --> 19:25.354
- There's a car. Hey.
- Hi.

19:26.120 --> 19:27.872
Come on, stop.

19:30.040 --> 19:31.758
Hi, Kelly.

19:34.600 --> 19:36.079
I know you've been punished...

19:36.280 --> 19:40.558
...because you had to spend
the last hour Ralph-less.

19:40.760 --> 19:42.876
But being that I'm a forgiving guy...

19:43.080 --> 19:46.038
...I'm willing to let you hop in...

19:46.240 --> 19:49.596
...and partake in the nectar that is I.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.831
Hey, how about this.

19:53.080 --> 19:56.516
I'm with my friends,
so why don't we all go into the field...

19:56.720 --> 19:58.073
...and we can fight over you.

19:58.280 --> 20:02.068
You know, pull each other's hair and
roll around until our dresses ride up...

20:02.320 --> 20:04.072
...or get ripped to shreds
or something?

20:04.280 --> 20:08.876
Well, I guess
I'm Ralph enough for three.

20:12.920 --> 20:14.956
Oh, wait. And Ralph...

20:15.200 --> 20:17.077
...why don't you
pull your pants down.

20:17.280 --> 20:19.953
You know, to further fire our ardour?

20:20.200 --> 20:22.714
All right. But hold
each other's hands.

20:22.960 --> 20:25.520
I don't want anyone
to get frightened.

20:28.360 --> 20:32.273
All right, here comes
a big slice of heaven.

20:40.000 --> 20:43.913
Hey, stupid tramps.
That's not the field.

20:44.160 --> 20:45.639
That's my car.

20:45.880 --> 20:49.429
And that is not even
Ralph enough for one.

20:55.120 --> 20:57.076
So long, sucker.

20:58.480 --> 21:01.074
Wait a second.
How am I supposed to get home?

21:01.720 --> 21:03.551
Walk in these, butthead.

21:22.040 --> 21:23.553
Hey, buddy...

21:23.840 --> 21:25.353
...how's it going?

21:25.600 --> 21:27.431
My car broke down.

21:28.520 --> 21:30.351
So, what are you so happy about?

21:30.600 --> 21:33.194
Because it broke down
on my way home from the date.

21:33.440 --> 21:35.590
I just got me some.

21:39.640 --> 21:42.393
Well, I was out with this girl...

21:42.600 --> 21:45.353
...I bought her popcorn,
took her to the movies, everything.

21:45.600 --> 21:49.798
She wouldn't put out.
Some tramp named Kelly Bundy.

21:52.520 --> 21:56.229
- So I guess it was her loss, huh?
- Definitely.

22:00.600 --> 22:02.989
Well, I better get on home.

22:03.240 --> 22:06.391
I just got the measles
and I'm really contagious.

22:15.920 --> 22:18.354
Consider that a present from Kelly.
