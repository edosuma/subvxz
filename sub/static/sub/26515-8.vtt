[Robin]
<i>Previously on</i> Titans...

00:21.434 --> 00:26.434
Put your hands
on this rendered flesh.

00:30.809 --> 00:32.445
[gasping]

00:32.478 --> 00:34.514
He says your birth mother
is still alive.

00:34.546 --> 00:35.548
What?

00:35.582 --> 00:37.350
He claims
they've been
holding her prisoner.

00:37.384 --> 00:42.088
I'll go with you.
If your mom's there,
we'll find her.

00:42.121 --> 00:43.691
Damn it!

00:43.691 --> 00:45.758
[Gar] <i>Public records show
the facility is closed
and abandoned.</i>

00:45.792 --> 00:47.695
Be stupid
to back out now.

00:47.728 --> 00:49.896
<i>Once we're inside,
we'd still be pretty
heavily outnumbered.</i>

00:49.929 --> 00:52.131
-Gar!
<i>-But I've faced worse.</i>

00:52.131 --> 00:56.235
Don't worry.
He's just taking
a little nap.

00:56.268 --> 00:57.938
<i>Please relax, Mr. Grayson.</i>

00:57.972 --> 01:01.673
I think you'll find
it will go easier
if you do.

01:01.707 --> 01:04.811
What the fuck is that?

01:04.844 --> 01:08.114
-Where are they?
-Undergoing evaluation.

01:08.149 --> 01:12.585
[man]
<i>We are but servants
tasked with finding you.</i>

01:12.618 --> 01:17.618
[in demonic voice]
I take it back.

01:20.692 --> 01:22.194
Are you Angela?

01:22.228 --> 01:23.862
Who are you?

01:23.897 --> 01:26.299
Your daughter.

01:26.332 --> 01:28.935
[man]
<i>You're coming with me, girl.</i>

01:28.968 --> 01:30.036
Right now!

01:30.069 --> 01:31.420
[screams]

01:36.942 --> 01:39.643
It all has to end.

01:57.096 --> 01:58.998
I've always
wanted one of these.

01:59.033 --> 02:02.067
I thought I heard Bruce
talking to someone downstairs.

02:02.102 --> 02:03.936
Diana.

02:03.969 --> 02:05.504
It's a Justice League thing.

02:05.504 --> 02:06.840
I talked her into
bringing me along.

02:06.840 --> 02:09.643
I thought we could
get into some trouble.

02:09.675 --> 02:12.812
But I guess
I missed all the fun.

02:12.844 --> 02:16.248
Yeah, it's not fun.

02:16.282 --> 02:19.752
It's the Joker.

02:19.786 --> 02:21.655
Oh.

02:21.687 --> 02:24.856
Even Diana thinks
that he's scary.

02:24.890 --> 02:26.992
Bruce didn't want me there.

02:27.026 --> 02:29.996
I went anyway.

02:30.028 --> 02:32.731
Now I'm thinking
he was right.

02:32.764 --> 02:35.801
What happened?

02:35.835 --> 02:38.337
A lot of people died.

02:38.371 --> 02:43.371
[sighs heavily]
We couldn't save them.

02:45.444 --> 02:48.147
I just feel like quitting.

02:48.181 --> 02:51.016
I don't blame you.

02:51.050 --> 02:53.786
You think
he's gonna quit, too?

02:53.819 --> 02:54.920
Who?

02:54.954 --> 02:58.091
The Joker.

02:58.123 --> 03:00.760
No.

03:00.794 --> 03:05.397
Bruce says
the Joker kills people
just because he can.

03:05.431 --> 03:09.568
He's never gonna stop.

03:09.602 --> 03:12.472
Damn it.

03:12.506 --> 03:14.908
Why the hell
do you always
have to be right?

03:14.942 --> 03:19.942
Because I'm older, smarter
and prettier than you.

03:21.313 --> 03:23.616
You and Bruce will stop him.

03:23.650 --> 03:28.650
I know you will,
because it's what you do.

03:28.955 --> 03:30.790
Thanks.

03:30.824 --> 03:33.325
You know,
Bruce is good at
a lot of things.

03:33.360 --> 03:36.963
Not so much the pep talk.

03:36.997 --> 03:40.199
Things get dark
and you need someone
to talk to,

03:40.233 --> 03:44.069
I'm always here.

03:44.104 --> 03:47.206
After all...

03:47.240 --> 03:52.240
Us sidekicks gotta
stick together.

03:54.313 --> 03:57.463
[theme music playing]

04:13.332 --> 04:16.201
[humming]

04:16.235 --> 04:18.271
[yawns] Rach?

04:18.305 --> 04:19.338
[startled gasp]

04:19.372 --> 04:21.206
You sacred
the shit out of me.

04:21.240 --> 04:23.644
There's irony here.

04:23.677 --> 04:25.678
You're aware it's, like,
super early, right?

04:25.711 --> 04:29.516
Yeah, I wanted
to make breakfast.

04:29.548 --> 04:31.117
I'll make the coffee.

04:31.151 --> 04:33.952
Thanks.

04:33.987 --> 04:36.923
So...

04:36.956 --> 04:40.059
-Dick and Kory.
-I know. Don't say it.

04:40.093 --> 04:42.127
-You knew?
-Please.

04:42.161 --> 04:45.732
Gross.

04:45.766 --> 04:48.935
Do you think
it's like thinking
about your parents?

04:48.968 --> 04:50.002
I wouldn't know.

04:50.036 --> 04:54.139
Good morning.

04:54.173 --> 04:55.841
Hi, Mom.

04:55.875 --> 04:57.810
Hi, baby.

04:57.843 --> 04:59.112
I made breakfast.

04:59.144 --> 05:01.213
I can see that.

05:01.247 --> 05:03.315
Are you hungry?

05:03.350 --> 05:05.884
In a minute.

05:05.918 --> 05:07.788
Five years, you, uh,

05:07.821 --> 05:12.821
you couldn't forget
how beautiful
a sunrise can be.

05:14.160 --> 05:15.660
Come here.

05:22.601 --> 05:27.072
May I put my arm
around you?

05:27.105 --> 05:30.855
I'd like that. Very much.

05:36.682 --> 05:39.720
-I, uh, can just--
-It's okay.

05:39.752 --> 05:43.589
You care about my daughter,
young man... A lot.

05:43.622 --> 05:48.161
I have eyes, you know.

05:48.194 --> 05:51.064
Do you want a hug?

05:51.096 --> 05:54.697
-No, I'm good.
-Join us?

06:06.512 --> 06:08.163
I'll stand.

06:17.156 --> 06:19.855
[distorted scream]

06:22.827 --> 06:25.432
You okay?

06:25.464 --> 06:29.702
I can't stop thinking
about the asylum.

06:29.735 --> 06:32.237
You were talking
in your sleep.

06:32.271 --> 06:35.408
Anything revealing?

06:35.442 --> 06:40.442
I'd tell you
if I could understand
a word you were saying.

06:42.548 --> 06:44.750
This not-knowing-
a-thing-about-myself thing

06:44.785 --> 06:49.785
is starting to get
really fucking old.

06:52.559 --> 06:55.559
You going somewhere?

06:58.132 --> 07:01.134
That asylum was home base
for those freaks.

07:01.168 --> 07:03.937
They won't be
bothering Rachel anymore.
She's safe now.

07:03.971 --> 07:07.875
She's even
got her mother back.

07:07.908 --> 07:10.343
Maybe she can try
to have a normal life.

07:10.377 --> 07:12.345
But not you.

07:12.379 --> 07:13.980
Is that it?

07:14.012 --> 07:16.483
[sighs deeply]

07:16.516 --> 07:18.151
Being Robin
doesn't work anymore.

07:18.185 --> 07:21.654
But not being Robin
doesn't work either.

07:21.687 --> 07:23.523
At least not
without some help.

07:23.557 --> 07:26.091
Help you can't get here.

07:26.125 --> 07:27.125
No.

07:37.136 --> 07:39.673
Well, maybe

07:39.706 --> 07:44.543
once I remember who I am and

07:44.577 --> 07:49.577
you figure out
who you're going to be...

07:50.716 --> 07:52.819
Maybe we...

07:52.853 --> 07:55.422
Try it again sometime.

07:55.454 --> 07:58.091
Yeah.

07:58.124 --> 08:00.223
Couldn't hurt.

08:07.567 --> 08:12.170
I can't tell you
what passed for pancakes
in that place, but...

08:12.204 --> 08:13.372
They didn't resemble this.

08:13.406 --> 08:15.574
My compliments to the chef.

08:15.608 --> 08:19.379
Well, it was
really mostly him.

08:19.411 --> 08:22.581
-Look, Rachel--
-I was wondering--

08:22.615 --> 08:25.052
Please.

08:25.084 --> 08:28.622
Rachel has been explaining
your situation to me.

08:28.654 --> 08:31.690
I understand
this place is on loan?

08:31.725 --> 08:33.226
Unofficially.

08:33.259 --> 08:36.361
The owner didn't exactly
give me permission
to stay here, but...

08:36.395 --> 08:38.631
I may have another option.

08:38.664 --> 08:40.634
I have a house.

08:40.667 --> 08:44.169
In Ohio.
It's been in my...

08:44.202 --> 08:48.075
Our family for decades.

08:48.107 --> 08:51.745
I was hoping that you...
we...

08:51.778 --> 08:54.413
All of you are welcome there
for as long as you want.

08:54.447 --> 08:57.383
I have more than
enough room, and

08:57.417 --> 08:59.785
it's the least I can do.

08:59.820 --> 09:02.355
Although I do wonder
what happens to your home

09:02.389 --> 09:05.091
when you've been locked away
for five years.

09:05.125 --> 09:09.129
Back taxes,
ton of unopened mail,
I imagine.

09:09.163 --> 09:10.996
What did you
have in your fridge?

09:11.029 --> 09:12.399
Hmm.

09:12.432 --> 09:16.235
This could be, like,
our secret base.
Oh! This is so cool, isn't it?

09:16.269 --> 09:19.739
[chuckles]

09:19.773 --> 09:22.023
Isn't it, Dick?

09:25.311 --> 09:28.148
[sighs]

09:28.182 --> 09:31.018
[Gar] So, what?
This is, like,
the end of the team?

09:31.051 --> 09:32.885
Technically, we were
never really a team--

09:32.885 --> 09:34.421
Oh, we were a team.

09:34.421 --> 09:37.190
I'll see you all
again sometime.

09:37.224 --> 09:41.160
Rachel...

09:41.193 --> 09:42.825
She'll be okay.

09:45.232 --> 09:46.767
I'll get them all
to the house safely,

09:46.767 --> 09:48.601
make sure there are
no stragglers on our tail.

09:48.601 --> 09:50.071
Then what?

09:50.104 --> 09:53.373
Then I guess it's time
to be Kory Anders.

09:53.407 --> 09:54.575
And who is she?

09:54.607 --> 09:56.644
Maybe whoever
I want her to be.

09:56.677 --> 09:59.446
Must be something
to have no past.

09:59.480 --> 10:03.884
Oh, yeah,
it's something, all right.

10:03.884 --> 10:07.788
I hope you find out
who's inside of there,
Dick Grayson.

10:07.822 --> 10:10.057
[both chuckle]

10:10.091 --> 10:13.594
You too, Kory Anders.
Or whatever your
actual name is.

10:13.594 --> 10:14.594
Yeah.

10:21.100 --> 10:22.100
Wait.

10:28.442 --> 10:31.879
Asshole.

10:31.913 --> 10:33.547
You sure
you're gonna be okay?

10:33.581 --> 10:36.280
What do you think?

11:01.741 --> 11:03.091
Twenty...

11:28.067 --> 11:32.605
I quit.

11:32.639 --> 11:35.708
Great to see you, too.

11:35.743 --> 11:39.679
I'm late.

11:39.712 --> 11:43.616
You coming or not?

11:43.650 --> 11:46.687
I thought you already
quit Batman.

11:46.720 --> 11:49.856
Not Batman this time.

11:49.889 --> 11:54.240
-Robin.
-Okay. What happened?

11:55.062 --> 11:59.533
I couldn't get
a handle on the violence.
It was getting worse.

11:59.566 --> 12:01.034
That's hard to imagine.

12:01.067 --> 12:04.971
I know. I went cold turkey.
Burned the suit.

12:05.004 --> 12:06.407
Wow!

12:06.441 --> 12:10.811
That's dramatic.
Mine's in the closet.
Those things are expensive.

12:10.845 --> 12:12.846
-So, how did you do it?
-Do what?

12:12.879 --> 12:15.883
-Quit.
-I didn't quit.

12:15.916 --> 12:19.052
I just...stopped.

12:19.086 --> 12:21.054
How is that different?

12:21.087 --> 12:24.292
You'll figure it out.
Really.

12:24.325 --> 12:29.325
The hardest part
is that it just takes time.

12:29.496 --> 12:31.631
You mind if I hang at
your place a while?

12:31.664 --> 12:33.533
I'm fine sleeping
on the couch.

12:33.567 --> 12:35.635
It's got your name on it.

12:35.668 --> 12:38.639
Stay as long as you need...

12:38.672 --> 12:43.621
As long as
you've still got game.

12:47.981 --> 12:51.432
-Fuck me.
-I'm waiting.

12:58.125 --> 13:01.761
Oh, I've missed you,
Boy Wonder.

13:01.794 --> 13:03.731
[chuckles]
That's my favorite one.

13:03.764 --> 13:06.835
All right, look.
I've got a showing
of some of my work later.

13:06.868 --> 13:11.868
Why don't you come along
and hang out with some
fabulous, normal people?

13:11.971 --> 13:15.875
-How does that sound?
-Great.

13:15.909 --> 13:17.510
Too much?

13:17.543 --> 13:18.745
Yeah, a little bit.

13:18.778 --> 13:21.115
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

13:21.149 --> 13:26.149
Why am I doubting
this idea already?

13:31.892 --> 13:33.928
[Gar] "No sugar added,
vegan vanilla pudding.

13:33.961 --> 13:38.265
Designed to appeal to those
seeking a gluten-free,
low-calorie dessert."

13:38.298 --> 13:41.567
-Sounds healthy.
-Sounds disgusting.

13:41.601 --> 13:44.601
[train horn blowing]

13:48.509 --> 13:51.359
I'll be right back.

13:54.115 --> 13:59.115
-Three shots of bourbon.
Run a tab.
-Yes, ma'am.

14:18.773 --> 14:20.640
[Gar] Rach just texted.
Her and Angela got
seats up front.

14:20.673 --> 14:23.177
-Let's go.
-Let's not.

14:23.211 --> 14:27.315
This whole train thing
sounded way funner
this morning.

14:27.347 --> 14:32.347
Those two need
some time alone,
don't you think?

14:32.686 --> 14:34.668
You wanna play a game?

14:36.023 --> 14:40.523
-Play with your phone.
-Sweet.

14:58.379 --> 15:02.015
-Wow. All this is for you?
-Yep.

15:02.048 --> 15:04.284
Some of the works
were published online,

15:04.284 --> 15:07.554
but most of it's
my personal stuff
from when I traveled.

15:07.589 --> 15:11.024
-This is really good.
-Don't sound so shocked.

15:11.057 --> 15:13.861
-No, I mean it.
-Yeah, I know you do.

15:13.894 --> 15:18.894
All right. There's some people
I need to talk to.
You go ahead and mingle.

15:18.932 --> 15:20.105
Mingle?

15:20.105 --> 15:23.136
You know, have an interaction
that's not agenda-driven?

15:23.136 --> 15:25.873
-Conversation instead of
an interrogation?
-Why?

15:25.907 --> 15:28.176
You could use some work
on your small talk.

15:28.176 --> 15:29.943
I know how to
make small talk.

15:29.976 --> 15:31.245
[clicks tongue]

15:31.245 --> 15:33.081
-Sometimes you're
confrontational.
-No, I'm not.

15:33.114 --> 15:35.115
-Like right now.
-I am not.

15:35.149 --> 15:38.219
Wow. That was adult.

15:38.253 --> 15:42.956
I have to go be Donna Troy.
You just try
and enjoy yourself.

15:42.990 --> 15:44.024
Mmm-hmm.

15:44.057 --> 15:46.908
-Are, too.
-Am not.

15:54.067 --> 15:56.168
I so got this.

16:09.216 --> 16:12.953
What do you see
when you stare at me?

16:12.986 --> 16:17.825
Do I look like
what you imagined?

16:17.857 --> 16:21.395
It's okay.

16:21.428 --> 16:23.498
You know,
when you were born,

16:23.530 --> 16:27.000
I refused to let the nurses
take you away from me.

16:27.033 --> 16:28.501
You did?

16:28.534 --> 16:29.604
They tried,

16:29.638 --> 16:32.974
but I insisted on having you
in my arms at all times,

16:33.006 --> 16:38.006
just so I could keep
looking at you.

16:38.046 --> 16:42.482
What else?

16:42.515 --> 16:46.120
Uh, let's see.

16:46.153 --> 16:48.623
You never cried. Never.

16:48.657 --> 16:52.894
You just looked at me
with those big, serious eyes.

16:52.927 --> 16:55.898
Kind of like
you're doing right now.

16:55.931 --> 17:00.931
It's okay. It was as if
you wanted to
ask me something,

17:01.070 --> 17:04.006
and I'd just look at you
and I'd say,
"Don't you worry, little girl,

17:04.038 --> 17:09.038
we'll have plenty of time
to talk about this
when you're bigger."

17:10.912 --> 17:15.016
Only we didn't.

17:15.048 --> 17:20.048
We lost so much time.
So many years.

17:21.821 --> 17:25.326
Was Melissa
someone you knew?

17:25.359 --> 17:29.364
She was my friend.
My good friend.

17:29.396 --> 17:31.432
Your father's people
wanted to get their
hands on you,

17:31.465 --> 17:36.465
and I knew
they would never stop,
no matter how far we ran.

17:37.372 --> 17:41.342
So I asked her to take you.

17:41.375 --> 17:46.375
I made her promise
to disappear.
No contact whatsoever.

17:46.647 --> 17:51.647
And I made her swear
that she would never
tell you about me.

17:51.787 --> 17:56.787
[voice breaks]
It's the hardest thing
I ever did in my life.

17:57.791 --> 17:58.993
I'm so sorry.

17:59.027 --> 18:03.498
Oh, Rachel, no.
You have nothing to
be sorry about.

18:03.530 --> 18:08.530
I know you loved her,
and she loved you.
That's what I wanted.

18:10.971 --> 18:15.771
I just wanted you
to have a mom.

18:22.549 --> 18:27.549
Those people
that were after me,
they worked for my father?

18:31.025 --> 18:36.025
Yes. Your dad was
very charismatic.

18:36.798 --> 18:41.234
He recognized
the power inside you
at an early age,

18:41.269 --> 18:43.403
and he wanted to exploit it.

18:43.438 --> 18:44.705
He built up
a lot of followers.

18:44.705 --> 18:49.705
A cult of personality,
if you will.

18:50.778 --> 18:55.979
Are either of you... like me?
The things I can do...

18:57.681 --> 19:01.018
You get that from him.

19:03.657 --> 19:08.657
-Where is he now?
-He's gone, Rachel.
Long time ago.

19:08.696 --> 19:10.664
Those people
who were chasing you,

19:10.699 --> 19:15.699
they were just
some of his followers.

19:16.136 --> 19:18.839
He can't hurt you anymore.

19:18.874 --> 19:23.874
And now,
thanks to your friends,
neither can his people.

19:26.681 --> 19:29.450
I never dreamed
this could happen.

19:29.483 --> 19:32.988
All those years
in that awful place.

19:33.020 --> 19:38.020
-But the hope of it
kept me alive.
-The hope of what?

19:41.795 --> 19:45.199
You're safe.

19:45.232 --> 19:50.232
That one day,
you and I would
finally be safe.

20:31.779 --> 20:36.779
-Do you think
Rachel's mad at me?
-Why would she be mad at you?

20:37.019 --> 20:41.255
At the asylum,
when I attacked that guy,
maybe I freaked her out.

20:41.288 --> 20:46.059
Maybe it freaked you out.

20:46.093 --> 20:49.630
How did it feel?

20:49.663 --> 20:53.099
Weird.

20:53.134 --> 20:54.469
I didn't hate it.

20:54.501 --> 20:58.640
Good. You shouldn't.
It's a part of who you are.

20:58.673 --> 21:02.644
-I killed him.
-He could've killed you.

21:02.676 --> 21:07.676
Don't ever be ashamed
of defending yourself.

21:08.782 --> 21:12.386
When I'm the tiger,
it's not completely me.

21:12.420 --> 21:15.021
It's like
I'm inside something
controlling it,

21:15.056 --> 21:18.655
but it has control, too.

21:20.528 --> 21:23.030
You and Rachel have
something in common.

21:23.065 --> 21:26.166
You're both learning
how to control your abilities.

21:26.200 --> 21:31.200
It creates a connection
between you two.

21:32.574 --> 21:36.678
-You wanna make out
with her, don't you?
-What? No.

21:36.711 --> 21:38.246
It's perfectly natural,
kissing.

21:38.246 --> 21:39.614
I'm not comfortable
talking about this.

21:39.614 --> 21:41.781
-You're getting agitated.
-Yeah. You think?

21:41.815 --> 21:43.852
[laughs]

21:43.884 --> 21:48.884
-Can I have that?
-Sure.
Apparently, it helps.

21:50.758 --> 21:52.226
Or not.

21:52.259 --> 21:53.259
[gags]

21:57.698 --> 21:59.198
Stay here.

22:06.906 --> 22:09.906
That's why I called.

22:26.894 --> 22:28.243
-Hi.
-Hi.

22:37.270 --> 22:39.205
-You have five seconds.
-To do what?

22:39.240 --> 22:41.008
To tell me
who the fuck you are.

22:41.040 --> 22:43.243
My name is Jerry.

22:43.277 --> 22:45.346
Why were you looking at me?

22:45.378 --> 22:48.682
I thought you were hot.
Attractive. Sorry.

22:48.715 --> 22:51.251
You're lying.
You're with the people
from the asylum.

22:51.285 --> 22:52.820
What?

22:52.854 --> 22:54.922
-Where are the others?
-I don't know what
you're talking about.

22:54.954 --> 22:56.454
Don't lie.

23:01.561 --> 23:06.561
[strangled voice]
I can't breathe.

23:09.436 --> 23:11.338
[gasping and coughing]

23:11.372 --> 23:12.571
Get out.

23:20.980 --> 23:24.431
[ambient music playing]

23:29.656 --> 23:32.693
She has an incredible eye,
don't you think?

23:32.727 --> 23:34.494
Yeah, and a killer left hook.

23:34.528 --> 23:37.664
[chuckles]

23:37.699 --> 23:39.133
I've known her
since we were kids.

23:39.133 --> 23:40.102
School?

23:40.102 --> 23:41.903
No, her mom worked
with my dad sometimes,

23:41.936 --> 23:43.503
so we ended up
hanging out a lot.

23:43.538 --> 23:45.440
I was there when
she got her first camera.

23:45.472 --> 23:48.742
-That's interesting. So--
-It was a Nikon F5.

23:48.777 --> 23:51.011
She must've burned through
50 rolls of film
in her first week.

23:51.046 --> 23:53.181
That was before
everything went digital,
of course.

23:53.214 --> 23:57.085
I still prefer analog myself.
I mean,
a pixel's a pixel, right?

23:57.118 --> 23:59.686
And who doesn't like
the ability to fabricate
a chroma schematic?

23:59.721 --> 24:03.290
-I mean, that's--
-[woman] Paul.

24:03.324 --> 24:04.857
Excuse me.

24:04.892 --> 24:08.162
Thank you.

24:08.194 --> 24:10.144
Who was that?

24:13.734 --> 24:16.998
I wonder what
the Penguin's doing
right now.

24:35.122 --> 24:37.424
How're you doing?

24:37.458 --> 24:40.595
Make any new friends?
Learn anything?

24:40.627 --> 24:43.030
Well, I've had about 100
of these bacon-wrapped dates.

24:43.064 --> 24:46.867
Great. Look, I just...
I got a text.
It's a work thing.

24:46.901 --> 24:49.971
-Someone I need to go
meet right now.
-So, we're leaving?

24:50.005 --> 24:55.005
Me, leaving. You, having fun.
Seriously, Dick,
just try to relax.

24:55.777 --> 24:59.480
Let your hair down.
Have a drink, have two.

24:59.513 --> 25:02.482
Pretend you're
with Bruce on a yacht.

25:02.517 --> 25:04.484
I always got seasick.

25:04.519 --> 25:06.753
That's why it's pretend.

25:06.788 --> 25:08.056
I'll be back in less
than an hour, okay?

25:08.056 --> 25:13.056
-You want company?
-No, thank you.

25:15.829 --> 25:20.829
Yeah, Agent Franklin?
My name's Jerry Ridley,
US Marshal.

25:21.068 --> 25:25.838
The woman you got posted
for the attack
on those cops in Illinois...

25:25.873 --> 25:27.407
I got her.

25:27.441 --> 25:29.691
[siren wailing]

25:35.348 --> 25:37.898
[tires squealing]

25:50.263 --> 25:52.298
Am I supposed
to feel numb?

25:52.333 --> 25:54.568
How many have you had?

25:54.602 --> 25:57.371
-Just one.
-[chuckles]

25:57.404 --> 25:58.806
You should probably quit now.

25:58.839 --> 26:00.342
[announcer over p.a.]
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

26:00.342 --> 26:03.077
<i>we have an obstruction
on the track
about a mile ahead.</i>

26:03.077 --> 26:05.079
<i>Once we get that cleared,
we'll be back on our way.</i>

26:05.113 --> 26:07.384
<i>Sorry about
the inconvenience.</i>

26:10.084 --> 26:11.611
What's wrong?

26:13.688 --> 26:16.457
Probably just being paranoid.

26:16.490 --> 26:19.039
[tires squealing]

26:38.077 --> 26:41.048
Donna Troy.

26:41.082 --> 26:43.951
-Graham Norris.
-Thank you for
agreeing to meet.

26:43.984 --> 26:46.954
My contact told me
you can be trusted.

26:46.954 --> 26:48.623
He never mentioned
you'd be so beautiful.

26:48.623 --> 26:52.460
My contact told me
you'd say that.

26:52.492 --> 26:54.863
Ground rules... No recording.

26:54.863 --> 26:56.230
You can photograph
the merchandise,

26:56.230 --> 26:58.566
but don't even think of
pointing that camera at me.

26:58.598 --> 27:01.769
Why did you agree to meet?
It's a risky move.

27:01.803 --> 27:05.406
I'm not afraid
of taking a risk.

27:05.440 --> 27:07.842
I've been working for a man
named Andrew Ullman,

27:07.875 --> 27:09.344
running his
Cape Town operation.

27:09.377 --> 27:12.247
He's recently decided to make
some personnel changes.

27:12.279 --> 27:17.279
So, I've recently
decided to give him
some unwanted publicity.

27:18.419 --> 27:22.318
Let's see what you've got.

27:29.096 --> 27:31.532
I shot most
of these myself.

27:31.567 --> 27:36.537
You can't really
see from out there.
Why don't you come inside?

27:36.570 --> 27:38.906
I'm good.

27:38.940 --> 27:40.409
You do know
you're looking at

27:40.442 --> 27:42.643
well over
half a million dollars' worth
of merchandise here.

27:42.676 --> 27:45.079
How do you get it
past the inspectors?

27:45.113 --> 27:46.480
You mean,
how does Ullman do it.

27:46.515 --> 27:49.951
Well, inspectors don't
get paid much
here or abroad.

27:49.983 --> 27:52.287
Some of them need
money quite badly.

27:52.319 --> 27:54.821
I mean, you know,
their houses burn down,

27:54.855 --> 27:57.526
their children require
sudden medical attention.

27:57.558 --> 28:01.362
So, Ullman gets arrested,
and there goes
your competition.

28:01.394 --> 28:03.263
You'll corner the market.

28:03.297 --> 28:04.633
Hmm.

28:04.665 --> 28:07.602
Or your photographs
will bring the whole trade
tumbling down.

28:07.634 --> 28:10.372
Who knows, really?

28:10.404 --> 28:13.473
But then,
what's life without
a little risk?

28:13.507 --> 28:15.143
Be honest, Ms. Troy.

28:15.175 --> 28:18.446
Aren't you curious
to know what it's like
to relax in front of a fire,

28:18.480 --> 28:23.480
feeling the fur
of a bear-skin rug
all over your body?

28:27.587 --> 28:29.624
[loud clanging]

28:29.656 --> 28:31.525
Terry!

28:31.558 --> 28:35.194
Show Donna
our star attraction.

28:35.229 --> 28:37.479
[bear grunting]

28:40.602 --> 28:43.238
The Chinese have
a lucrative market
in bear organs.

28:43.270 --> 28:46.574
Some of them will pay a small
fortune for the privilege
to hunt this bear,

28:46.606 --> 28:49.209
and then sell it
off for parts.

28:49.242 --> 28:50.877
Hunt?

28:50.912 --> 28:52.346
And how does that work,
exactly?

28:52.380 --> 28:55.615
Well, the bear's sedated,
men are well armed,

28:55.650 --> 28:57.884
the outcome's
not in question.

28:57.919 --> 29:01.721
For you, sweetheart,
it's on the house.

29:01.756 --> 29:04.991
Go on. Have a shot.

29:05.025 --> 29:07.162
Sorry.

29:07.162 --> 29:10.964
The only thing
I point at animals
is my camera.

29:10.999 --> 29:15.999
Well, in that case,
you got what you came for.

29:17.338 --> 29:20.842
Thank you for
your time, Mr. Norris.

29:20.875 --> 29:24.112
It's been a real education.

29:24.144 --> 29:29.144
My pleasure, Donna.
I'm sure we'll meet again.

29:35.655 --> 29:37.905
[Dick grunting]

29:50.471 --> 29:52.940
Dick, what the hell
are you doing here?

29:52.973 --> 29:54.474
You were just
gonna let him go?

29:54.508 --> 29:57.357
I was doing my job.

30:01.048 --> 30:03.183
Graham is one of
a dozen poachers.

30:03.183 --> 30:05.053
My photos would've shut down
the whole operation

30:05.053 --> 30:06.586
from Chicago to Cape Town.

30:06.621 --> 30:10.057
Now all I have is...

30:10.090 --> 30:12.394
-That.
-One more off the streets.

30:12.426 --> 30:17.426
You can go after the others
one by one if you have to.
I'll help you.

30:18.800 --> 30:22.202
Graham likes me.
If I can convince him that
I wasn't a part of this--

30:22.202 --> 30:24.404
You're still gonna
let him go?

30:24.438 --> 30:27.340
[sighs]

30:27.374 --> 30:28.576
Take out your phone.

30:28.608 --> 30:32.058
-My phone?
-Just do it.

30:33.780 --> 30:38.252
-Donna.
-Now, take a picture.

30:38.286 --> 30:42.056
-What're you doing?
-Just take a picture

30:42.089 --> 30:45.990
of both of us unconscious.

30:48.363 --> 30:49.832
It's the button
with the little
camera on it.

30:49.865 --> 30:54.865
-Yeah, I know how to--
-Then just do it.
Take a bunch of 'em.

30:56.136 --> 30:57.872
[camera shutter clicking]

30:57.904 --> 31:02.904
-You guys look good together.
-Fuck you.

31:05.779 --> 31:09.750
You and me,
we need to talk.

31:09.784 --> 31:11.919
Now, please!

31:11.952 --> 31:14.189
Why do I always feel like
I'm in trouble with you?

31:14.189 --> 31:17.758
Because you are in trouble.

31:17.791 --> 31:20.628
-Am not.
-I can hear you...

31:20.662 --> 31:24.820
-Bird boy.
-[chuckles] Oh,
that's my favorite one.

31:27.868 --> 31:30.305
Man of action, is that it?

31:30.337 --> 31:33.974
If it means not letting
some evil piece of shit walk.

31:34.008 --> 31:36.711
You're smarter than that.
You know me.

31:36.744 --> 31:41.744
You knew
I had it under control.
So, why jump in? Seriously.

31:42.217 --> 31:44.318
I was worried.
What if he got away?

31:44.352 --> 31:46.453
But you knew
he probably wouldn't,

31:46.488 --> 31:51.438
-that I had a plan.
-But what if?

31:56.297 --> 31:58.767
You know,
when Diana took me in,

31:58.799 --> 32:01.669
she showed me
how to fill the hole
that fire left in my life

32:01.701 --> 32:05.339
with love and with family.

32:05.373 --> 32:07.709
That's just what
the Amazons do.

32:07.742 --> 32:12.742
They have a tradition
of empowerment
and self-discovery.

32:13.448 --> 32:17.852
Bruce filled that hole
in your life
the only way he knew how.

32:17.884 --> 32:22.190
With rage and violence.

32:22.222 --> 32:25.492
Wonder Woman was born
to protect the innocent.

32:25.527 --> 32:30.527
Batman was created
to punish the guilty.

32:30.564 --> 32:33.034
But we're not them.

32:33.067 --> 32:35.303
Neither one of us.

32:35.336 --> 32:38.606
I didn't quit
being Wonder Girl.

32:38.640 --> 32:43.640
I just realized that
I could do more good
being Donna Troy.

32:43.676 --> 32:46.713
Do you understand?

32:46.747 --> 32:48.482
I'm trying to.

32:48.516 --> 32:51.251
You'll never be
a civilian, Dick.

32:51.286 --> 32:54.355
You lost that chance
the day you became Robin.

32:54.388 --> 32:57.692
And you can't be
Robin anymore, because
for all the good he did,

32:57.726 --> 33:01.996
ultimately, he was
an echo chamber
for Bruce's pain...

33:02.028 --> 33:06.067
And for yours.

33:06.099 --> 33:09.336
You wanna go out there
and kick bad-guy ass?

33:09.369 --> 33:12.940
You wanna make sure
there's not a chance,
not a single chance,

33:12.973 --> 33:16.544
even one of them gets away?

33:16.576 --> 33:18.046
Do it.

33:18.078 --> 33:20.013
I won't be Batman.

33:20.048 --> 33:21.749
Then don't.

33:21.781 --> 33:25.153
Don't be Batman or Robin.

33:25.185 --> 33:28.756
-Be something else.
Someone else.
-Who?

33:28.788 --> 33:30.787
[scoffs]

33:32.894 --> 33:36.029
Hell if I know.

33:36.064 --> 33:38.666
But whoever
you're gonna be...

33:38.700 --> 33:43.700
I don't think
you'll ever be much good
at the small talk.

33:44.071 --> 33:46.907
Maybe not.

33:46.941 --> 33:50.540
There's worse qualities.

33:53.114 --> 33:55.416
Why do you have to
be right all the time?

33:55.450 --> 34:00.450
Older, smarter, prettier.
You know the drill.

34:01.288 --> 34:03.592
All right.
Now, let me have
your phone.

34:03.625 --> 34:06.028
I can use those photos
of me and Crocodile Dundee
knocked out

34:06.060 --> 34:10.931
to prove I wasn't in
the shit show that you
just put on back there.

34:10.965 --> 34:12.014
Really?

34:19.539 --> 34:21.076
What?

34:21.110 --> 34:24.311
Why do you have pictures
of letters in some
offshoot of Sumerian

34:24.344 --> 34:26.079
on your cell phone?

34:26.114 --> 34:28.148
That's not Sumerian.
We searched every database.

34:28.181 --> 34:29.483
I said "offshoot."

34:29.516 --> 34:32.320
This alphabet has
been lost for centuries.

34:32.353 --> 34:34.422
We learned a little bit of it
on Themyscira.

34:34.456 --> 34:37.925
Hold on.
Can you translate that?

34:37.958 --> 34:42.764
I have some books.

34:42.797 --> 34:44.865
[announcer]
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
please remain seated.</i>

34:44.900 --> 34:48.034
<i>We'll be stopping briefly
and resuming our trip
in just a few minutes.</i>

34:48.068 --> 34:50.768
<i>Thank you.</i>

35:00.949 --> 35:05.949
Wake up. We have to find
Angela and Rachel. Come on!

35:16.898 --> 35:20.802
-Wanna tell me
what's going on?
-Just keep moving.

35:20.835 --> 35:23.304
-Where's Rachel?
-She went to the bathroom.
Why?

35:23.338 --> 35:24.672
-I need you to find Rachel...
-What's happening?

35:24.706 --> 35:26.507
-...and get them
out of the train.
-The conductor--

35:26.539 --> 35:27.742
Just do it.

35:27.775 --> 35:31.945
-What're you gonna do?
-I'm fine. Just go.

35:31.978 --> 35:32.978
Okay.

35:44.557 --> 35:46.208
We got her.

35:52.467 --> 35:55.617
[police siren whoops]

36:04.211 --> 36:07.181
Get down on the ground!

36:07.215 --> 36:12.052
Come on out
with your hands up!

36:12.085 --> 36:16.856
Not today.

36:16.891 --> 36:18.541
[screaming]

36:26.001 --> 36:28.936
-Kory said
to meet down the road.
-We can't just leave her.

36:28.969 --> 36:33.969
She said go, so we go.
Pretty sure
she can handle herself.

36:34.041 --> 36:37.644
Come on.
There's our ride.

36:37.677 --> 36:40.077
[tiger snarling]

36:44.851 --> 36:47.402
[iron bar clangs]

36:51.358 --> 36:56.009
[rock music plays
on car radio]

36:59.400 --> 37:04.400
-Do you wanna drive?
-If you don't mind.

37:07.074 --> 37:10.677
-What exactly is this music?
-AC/DC.

37:10.710 --> 37:11.911
Not bad.

37:36.137 --> 37:37.137
Cool.

38:07.835 --> 38:10.385
[softly] Come on.

38:28.021 --> 38:31.324
Kory?

38:31.358 --> 38:34.509
-What?
-Are you okay?

38:40.702 --> 38:44.572
Something's wrong with me.
My head.

38:44.606 --> 38:48.909
What happened
at the asylum, it just...

38:48.943 --> 38:50.893
I don't know.

38:56.050 --> 39:00.086
If your brain is hurt,

39:00.121 --> 39:03.958
maybe I can heal it

39:03.990 --> 39:06.728
like I heal wounds.

39:06.760 --> 39:11.760
It might even bring
your memory back.

39:12.400 --> 39:16.503
I don't think it works
that way, Rachel.

39:16.536 --> 39:21.536
Well, there's only
one way to find out, right?

39:25.413 --> 39:28.449
[Kory]
Do you have any idea
what you're doing?

39:28.483 --> 39:32.152
-None.
-Okay. [chuckles]

39:32.186 --> 39:36.085
Yeah, let's give it a try.

39:39.427 --> 39:42.128
And if anything
starts to hurt,
let me know.

39:42.163 --> 39:43.163
Okay.

39:50.137 --> 39:51.773
-Can you check again?
-I did.

39:51.806 --> 39:54.141
It's definitely
a mission statement
for your friend Kory,

39:54.175 --> 39:59.175
who's referred to by name
or as Night or Starfire.

40:05.786 --> 40:08.222
Look, these words
often have a double meaning.

40:08.257 --> 40:13.061
Like <i>aloha</i> or <i>shalom,</i>
they can mean
both "hello" and "goodbye."

40:13.094 --> 40:18.094
It says here,
"Her mission is to
secure the Raven,"

40:18.599 --> 40:23.599
which could mean
"take control of"
or "take care of."

40:26.541 --> 40:28.708
Do you feel anything?

40:28.742 --> 40:30.210
No.

40:30.244 --> 40:34.782
Maybe a little tingling,
but...

40:34.815 --> 40:36.150
Rachel, I don't think this--

40:36.182 --> 40:40.054
[exhales heavily]

40:40.086 --> 40:42.786
[distorted voices]

40:45.159 --> 40:46.159
Kory?

40:50.498 --> 40:51.865
"Take care of"?

40:51.900 --> 40:55.903
Unless I'm reading
this wrong...

40:55.936 --> 40:58.693
Your friend Kory is here
to kill Rachel.

41:03.510 --> 41:05.161
[screaming]

41:13.086 --> 41:15.121
[theme music playing]
