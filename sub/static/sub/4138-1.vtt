00:20.312 --> 00:24.315
And that completes my final report
until we reach touchdown.

00:24.400 --> 00:28.194
We're now on full automatic,
in the hands of the computers.

00:28.279 --> 00:31.155
I've tucked my crew in for the long sleep

00:31.240 --> 00:33.241
and I'll be joining them

00:33.325 --> 00:35.201
soon.

00:35.286 --> 00:39.497
In less than an hour we'll finish
our sixth month out of Cape Kennedy.

00:39.582 --> 00:42.083
Six months in deep space.

00:42.167 --> 00:44.294
By our time, that is.

00:45.170 --> 00:46.796
According to Dr. Hasslein's theory

00:46.880 --> 00:51.426
of time in a vehicle
traveling nearly the speed of light,

00:51.510 --> 00:55.638
the Earth has aged
nearly 700 years since we left it,

00:55.723 --> 00:57.849
while we've aged hardly at all.

01:00.728 --> 01:02.812
It may be so.

01:02.896 --> 01:04.980
This much is probably true.

01:05.065 --> 01:09.277
The men who sent us on this journey
are long since dead and gone.

01:09.361 --> 01:13.364
You who are reading me now
are a different breed.

01:13.449 --> 01:15.992
I hope a better one.

01:16.076 --> 01:19.662
I leave the 20th century
with no regrets, but...

01:19.747 --> 01:21.372
one more thing.

01:21.498 --> 01:23.625
If anybody's listening, that is.

01:23.709 --> 01:27.295
Nothing scientific. It's... purely personal.

01:28.881 --> 01:30.923
Seen from out here,

01:31.884 --> 01:33.968
everything seems different.

01:34.053 --> 01:36.179
Time bends.

01:36.263 --> 01:38.931
Space is... boundless.

01:39.016 --> 01:41.726
It squashes a man's ego.

01:43.562 --> 01:45.897
I feel lonely.

01:53.739 --> 01:55.823
That's about it.

01:57.826 --> 01:59.911
Tell me, though...

02:00.704 --> 02:03.539
Does man, that marvel of the universe,

02:03.624 --> 02:07.418
that glorious paradox
who has sent me to the stars,

02:07.503 --> 02:10.213
still make war against his brother,

02:11.632 --> 02:14.592
keep his neighbor's children starving?

07:15.811 --> 07:17.895
Are you all right?

07:25.070 --> 07:30.658
Stewart?

07:50.053 --> 07:52.096
We're in the soup!

07:52.180 --> 07:55.766
She's sinking!
Dodge, read the atmosphere!

08:09.990 --> 08:13.451
Landon, get out a last signal!

08:13.535 --> 08:15.703
What signal?

08:15.787 --> 08:18.914
To Earth! That we've landed!

08:59.956 --> 09:02.333
The air's OK!

09:02.417 --> 09:06.253
Blow the hatch
before we lose all our power!

09:13.845 --> 09:15.930
It's no use! The power's gone!

09:16.014 --> 09:19.016
Forget it! Abandon ship!

11:04.497 --> 11:06.457
She's sinking.

11:09.961 --> 11:15.382
Going...

11:18.637 --> 11:19.845
Gone.

11:23.934 --> 11:26.101
OK. We're here to stay.

11:40.158 --> 11:42.201
Well, where are we?

11:42.327 --> 11:44.370
Do you have any notion, skipper?

11:44.496 --> 11:47.539
We're some 320 light years from Earth

11:47.624 --> 11:52.753
on an unnamed planet in orbit
around a star in the constellation of Orion.

11:52.879 --> 11:54.964
Is that close enough for you?

11:56.007 --> 11:58.676
That could be Bellatrix.

11:58.760 --> 12:01.095
It's too white for Bellatrix.

12:01.179 --> 12:04.223
You didn't have time to read the tapes.

12:04.349 --> 12:07.017
So you really don't know, do you?

12:07.143 --> 12:09.186
What went wrong?

12:09.312 --> 12:12.022
We weren't
programmed to land in the water.

12:12.148 --> 12:16.110
The question is not so much
where we are as when we are.

12:16.194 --> 12:19.738
We've had enough sleep
to hold us for a while.

12:19.823 --> 12:22.408
Let's start earning all that back pay.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.698
Dodge, run your soil test.

13:05.243 --> 13:07.786
- Got your sensors?
- Right.

13:07.871 --> 13:09.997
- Geiger counter?
- Got it.

13:13.084 --> 13:15.252
Let's see. One pistol,

13:15.378 --> 13:20.382
20 rounds ammo, a medical kit,
camera, TX9.

13:20.467 --> 13:24.678
We've got food and water
enough for three days.

13:24.763 --> 13:26.847
How long is a day?

13:26.931 --> 13:29.016
That's a good question.

13:29.100 --> 13:30.559
Landon!

13:30.643 --> 13:32.644
Hey, Landon!

13:32.729 --> 13:34.813
Join the expedition.

13:37.192 --> 13:41.528
Sorry. I was thinking about Stewart.
What do you suppose happened?

13:41.613 --> 13:43.697
Air leak. She died in her sleep.

13:43.782 --> 13:46.033
You don't seem very cut up about it.

13:46.117 --> 13:49.703
It's a little late for a wake.
She's been dead nearly a year.

13:49.788 --> 13:53.374
That means we've been away
from Earth for 18 months.

13:53.458 --> 13:55.542
Our time.

13:56.753 --> 13:58.837
You've gone gray.

14:00.423 --> 14:05.219
Apart from that you look pretty chipper
for a man who's 2,031 years old.

14:05.303 --> 14:09.139
I read the clocks.
They bear out Hasslein's hypothesis.

14:09.224 --> 14:12.810
We have been away from Earth
for 2,000 years,

14:12.894 --> 14:14.978
give or take a decade.

14:15.730 --> 14:17.815
Still can't accept it?

14:17.899 --> 14:21.235
Time's wiped out
everything you ever knew.

14:21.319 --> 14:23.362
It's all dust.

14:23.488 --> 14:25.531
Prove it.

14:25.657 --> 14:28.409
If we can't get back, it's still just a theory.

14:28.493 --> 14:32.329
It's a fact, Landon.
Buy it. You'll sleep better.

14:33.164 --> 14:37.292
Nothing will grow here.
There's just a trace of carbohydrates.

14:37.377 --> 14:40.337
All the nitrogen is locked into the nitrates.

14:40.463 --> 14:42.506
No dangerous ionization?

14:42.590 --> 14:44.675
No.

14:44.759 --> 14:46.552
Well...

14:46.678 --> 14:51.014
If there's no life here,
we've got just 72 hours to find it.

14:51.141 --> 14:54.101
That's when the groceries run out.
Let's go.

14:54.185 --> 14:56.270
Which direction?

14:57.355 --> 14:59.440
That way.

14:59.524 --> 15:01.733
Any particular reason?

15:01.818 --> 15:03.902
None at all.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.991
Come on...

17:58.536 --> 18:00.662
Everybody all right?

18:01.873 --> 18:03.915
Water check.

18:11.466 --> 18:12.716
Eight ounces.

18:19.807 --> 18:21.892
It doesn't add up.

18:21.976 --> 18:24.227
Thunder and lightning, and no rain.

18:24.354 --> 18:26.396
Cloud cover at night.

18:26.522 --> 18:29.399
That strange luminosity...
yet there's no moon.

18:29.525 --> 18:31.568
If we could just get a fix.

18:31.694 --> 18:32.986
What would that tell you?

18:33.071 --> 18:35.197
I've told you where you are
and when you are.

18:35.281 --> 18:37.074
All right, all right.

18:37.158 --> 18:40.869
You're 300 light years
from your precious planet.

18:41.746 --> 18:45.666
Your loved ones are dead
and forgotten for 20 centuries.

18:45.750 --> 18:47.167
20!

18:47.251 --> 18:51.004
Even if you could get back, they'd think
you were something that fell out of a tree.

18:51.089 --> 18:53.090
Taylor, quit riding him.

18:53.174 --> 18:56.134
There is just one reality.
We are here and it is now.

18:56.219 --> 18:59.054
You get hold of that,
or you might as well be dead.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.139
I'm prepared to die.

19:04.018 --> 19:06.520
He's prepared to die.

19:06.604 --> 19:08.814
Doesn't that make you misty?

19:08.940 --> 19:11.942
Chalk up another victory
for the human spirit.

19:19.826 --> 19:24.121
Clue me in on something, will you?
Why did you sign on for this trip?

19:24.205 --> 19:26.289
You volunteered. Why?

19:26.416 --> 19:28.458
Never mind. I'll clue you in.

19:28.584 --> 19:31.878
You were
the golden boy of the class of '72.

19:31.963 --> 19:35.632
When they nominated you for the big one,
you couldn't turn it down.

19:35.758 --> 19:38.552
Not without losing
your all-American image.

19:38.636 --> 19:40.554
Climb off, will you?

19:40.638 --> 19:43.348
Oh, and the glory. Don't forget that.

19:43.474 --> 19:47.853
There's a life-size bronze statue of you
standing out there somewhere.

19:47.979 --> 19:51.815
It's probably turned green by now
and nobody can read the nameplate.

19:51.899 --> 19:54.276
But never let it be said
that we forget our heroes.

19:54.360 --> 19:56.820
Taylor, I'm telling you
to climb off my back.

19:56.904 --> 19:58.405
And there's one last item.

19:58.865 --> 20:02.325
Immortality.
You wanted to live for ever, didn't you?

20:02.452 --> 20:04.494
Well, you damn near made it.

20:04.620 --> 20:09.166
Except for me and Dodge,
you've lived longer than anyone ever born.

20:09.250 --> 20:13.086
And with our
lovely Lieutenant Stewart dead,

20:13.171 --> 20:16.006
it looks like you're the last of the line.

20:17.300 --> 20:20.510
You got what you wanted, tiger.
How does it taste?

20:21.846 --> 20:23.972
OK. You read me well enough.

20:24.056 --> 20:26.141
But why can't I read you?

20:26.225 --> 20:28.310
Don't bother.

20:28.394 --> 20:30.812
Dodge, there. He's not like me at all.

20:30.897 --> 20:33.523
But he makes sense.

20:33.608 --> 20:36.067
He'd walk naked into a live volcano

20:36.152 --> 20:40.280
if he thought he could learn something
that no other man knew.

20:40.364 --> 20:42.824
But you... You're no seeker.

20:42.909 --> 20:44.993
You're negative.

20:45.077 --> 20:49.331
- And I'm not prepared to die.
- I'd like to know why not.

20:49.415 --> 20:50.999
You thought life on Earth
was meaningless.

20:51.083 --> 20:53.627
You despised people.

20:53.711 --> 20:55.796
So what did you do? You ran out.

20:55.880 --> 20:58.381
No, no. It's not like that, Landon.

20:58.508 --> 21:00.842
I'm a seeker too.

21:00.927 --> 21:03.220
But my dreams aren't like yours.

21:03.304 --> 21:06.389
I can't help thinking
somewhere in the universe

21:06.516 --> 21:09.976
there has to be something
better than man. Has to be.

21:12.271 --> 21:14.356
Taylor, over here!

21:53.396 --> 21:54.771
Life.

22:09.620 --> 22:12.038
Where there's one, there's another.

22:12.123 --> 22:14.624
And another and another.

22:14.750 --> 22:16.793
Let's find 'em.

24:51.449 --> 24:53.533
Skipper!

24:54.493 --> 24:56.619
Look!

25:12.344 --> 25:14.429
Scarecrows?

25:15.264 --> 25:17.348
Let's see.

26:03.187 --> 26:05.271
To hell with the scarecrows!

27:27.521 --> 27:29.689
Taylor!

27:29.773 --> 27:31.816
Look at this.

27:56.800 --> 27:58.718
Taylor, look!

29:44.199 --> 29:46.367
They didn't leave much, did they?

30:16.523 --> 30:19.442
Well, at least they haven't tried to bite us.

30:20.444 --> 30:22.695
Blessed are the vegetarians.

30:27.993 --> 30:30.787
They look more or less human,

30:30.871 --> 30:32.955
but I think they're mute.

30:42.424 --> 30:45.051
We got off at the wrong stop.

30:46.720 --> 30:49.389
You're supposed to be
the optimist, Landon.

30:49.473 --> 30:51.140
Look on the bright side.

30:51.266 --> 30:56.854
If this is the best they've got around here,
in six months we'll be running this planet.

35:59.324 --> 36:00.366
Smile.

36:40.323 --> 36:43.117
Which one was wearing
the strange clothes?

36:44.161 --> 36:46.245
This one.

36:47.914 --> 36:49.999
Will he live?

36:50.083 --> 36:52.501
I don't know.

36:52.627 --> 36:55.004
This beast has lost a lot of blood.

37:01.678 --> 37:04.138
There's no probe here. Find one!

37:04.222 --> 37:06.307
Yes, sir.

37:06.391 --> 37:08.434
This place is dirty, doctor.

37:08.518 --> 37:14.106
Doctor, these animals are dirty. They stink
and they carry communicable diseases.

37:14.191 --> 37:17.526
Why aren't they cleaned up
before they're brought here?

37:17.694 --> 37:19.612
You don't sound happy in your work.

37:19.696 --> 37:22.740
I'm little more than a vet
in this laboratory.

37:22.866 --> 37:25.826
You promised to speak to Dr. Zaius
about me.

37:25.911 --> 37:29.538
I did. You know how
he looks down his nose at chimpanzees.

37:29.706 --> 37:32.208
But the quota system's been abolished.

37:32.292 --> 37:35.628
- You made it. Why can't I?
- What do you mean - made it?

37:35.712 --> 37:39.465
I'm an animal psychologist, that's all.
We have no authority.

37:39.549 --> 37:42.927
You do all right when it comes to
getting space and equipment.

37:43.053 --> 37:46.680
That's because Dr. Zaius
realizes our work has value.

37:46.765 --> 37:51.560
The foundations of scientific brain surgery
are being laid right here

37:51.728 --> 37:54.563
in studies of cerebral functions
of these animals.

37:55.941 --> 37:58.317
They're still dirty, doctor.

37:58.401 --> 38:01.362
And their bite is septic.
There. Look at that.

38:02.781 --> 38:04.907
Hold his jaw.

38:30.100 --> 38:32.685
- Good morning, Dr. Zira.
- Good morning, Julius.

38:32.769 --> 38:35.271
- How's our patient today?
- No change.

38:35.355 --> 38:38.023
The minute you open the door,
he goes into his act.

38:40.944 --> 38:42.528
Well!

38:42.612 --> 38:44.738
And what do we want this morning?

38:44.823 --> 38:47.449
Do we want something? Come on. Speak.

38:47.534 --> 38:48.993
Come on.

38:49.119 --> 38:50.369
Speak.

38:50.453 --> 38:52.830
Do we want some sugar, old-timer?

38:55.333 --> 38:57.710
You could get hurt doing that, doctor.

38:57.794 --> 39:00.212
Oh, don't be silly. He's perfectly tame.

39:00.297 --> 39:03.340
They're all tame
until they take a chunk out of you.

39:03.425 --> 39:06.802
Well, Bright Eyes.
Is our throat feeling better?

39:07.846 --> 39:09.930
Still hurts, doesn't it?

39:10.015 --> 39:13.058
See? He keeps pretending he can talk.

39:16.521 --> 39:19.231
That Bright Eyes is remarkable.

39:19.316 --> 39:21.817
He keeps trying to form words.

39:21.943 --> 39:24.653
You know what they say.
Human see, human do.

39:30.076 --> 39:31.535
Now what?

39:34.205 --> 39:36.290
He seems to want something.

39:37.876 --> 39:40.002
I'd be careful, doctor.

39:40.086 --> 39:41.337
What did I tell you?

39:41.421 --> 39:44.006
Try that again and I'll break your arm!

39:46.051 --> 39:48.844
Good morning, Your Excellency.

39:48.970 --> 39:51.013
Dr. Zaius.

39:52.849 --> 39:54.892
Good morning, sir.

39:55.518 --> 39:57.603
Open up, please.

39:57.687 --> 39:59.772
I'm so glad you could come.

39:59.856 --> 40:01.982
Sir, he's over here.

40:04.319 --> 40:06.403
Bright Eyes...

40:07.072 --> 40:09.156
Show him. Go ahead.

40:09.240 --> 40:11.325
Do your trick.

40:11.409 --> 40:12.826
Speak.

40:12.911 --> 40:15.037
Go on. Speak again.

40:17.540 --> 40:20.709
There! Can you believe it?

40:20.794 --> 40:22.878
Yes, amusing.

40:23.004 --> 40:25.047
A man acting like an ape.

40:27.342 --> 40:31.512
Dr. Zaius,
I could swear he's answering you.

40:31.596 --> 40:34.431
He has a definite gift for mimicry.

40:34.516 --> 40:36.850
Most unusual.

40:36.935 --> 40:39.561
He's using that old blanket as clothing.

40:40.897 --> 40:44.900
I wonder how he'd score
on a Hopkins manual dexterity test.

40:45.026 --> 40:47.236
An animal?

40:47.320 --> 40:48.362
Look!

40:48.446 --> 40:50.531
He's moving his fingers.

40:50.615 --> 40:53.033
Only because he saw you moving yours.

40:53.118 --> 40:55.995
But perhaps he understood.

40:56.079 --> 40:59.456
Man has no understanding.

40:59.541 --> 41:02.668
He can be taught a few simple tricks.
Nothing more.

41:03.586 --> 41:06.547
I'm afraid I must disagree.

41:06.631 --> 41:10.968
- According to my experiments...
- Dr. Zira, I must caution you.

41:11.094 --> 41:15.264
Experimental brain surgery
on these creatures is one thing,

41:15.348 --> 41:17.433
and I'm all in favor of it.

41:17.517 --> 41:21.687
But your behavioral studies
are something else again.

41:21.771 --> 41:26.775
To suggest that we can learn anything
about the simian nature

41:26.860 --> 41:29.403
from the study of man is sheer nonsense.

41:30.488 --> 41:32.656
Besides, man is a nuisance.

41:32.741 --> 41:36.243
He eats up his food supplies in the forest,

41:36.327 --> 41:40.789
then migrates to our green belts
and ravages our crops.

41:43.501 --> 41:46.754
The sooner he is exterminated the better.

41:47.964 --> 41:50.799
It's a question of simian survival.

42:02.812 --> 42:05.481
Is this the one you wanted, doctor?

42:06.608 --> 42:08.734
Oh, yes. Thank you.

42:08.818 --> 42:12.404
Bright Eyes, I've got a present for you.

42:22.832 --> 42:24.750
Put her in with him.

43:18.429 --> 43:20.514
Cornelius! Up here.

43:21.975 --> 43:24.059
Do you have to work tonight?

43:24.185 --> 43:25.394
No.

43:25.478 --> 43:27.563
Neither do I.

43:31.693 --> 43:34.278
Oh, Cornelius.

43:49.919 --> 43:52.045
There's Bright Eyes.

43:52.881 --> 43:54.923
The one I was telling you about.

43:55.008 --> 43:57.718
What's so special about him?

43:57.802 --> 43:59.303
Watch.

43:59.429 --> 44:00.846
Hello, Bright Eyes.

44:00.930 --> 44:03.015
How's our throat today?

44:08.062 --> 44:11.023
- Look! She remembers!
- Remembers what?

44:11.107 --> 44:13.192
The blood transfusion.

44:13.276 --> 44:14.651
Zira, really!

44:14.736 --> 44:16.862
You know, they can't... Watch out.

44:16.946 --> 44:18.780
Here comes number one.

44:18.865 --> 44:20.449
Something's bothering him.

44:20.533 --> 44:24.161
He's been prying around the lab
for the last two days.

44:24.287 --> 44:26.330
Good morning, Dr. Zaius.

44:26.456 --> 44:30.459
- You know my... Dr. Cornelius, my fiancé.
- Of course.

44:30.543 --> 44:31.752
The young ape with a shovel.

44:31.836 --> 44:35.589
I hear you're planning
another archaeological expedition.

44:35.673 --> 44:39.885
- With the Academy's approval, sir.
- The project will require my support.

44:39.969 --> 44:42.054
I hope I may count on it, sir.

44:42.138 --> 44:44.806
Cornelius, a friendly warning.

44:44.891 --> 44:49.853
As you dig for artifacts,
be sure you don't bury your reputation.

45:03.326 --> 45:07.204
Guard!

45:29.435 --> 45:30.602
Stop!

45:30.687 --> 45:32.980
You'll hurt him!

45:33.064 --> 45:35.148
Take him inside.

45:38.152 --> 45:41.655
Cornelius! Cornelius,
if you have a moment today,

45:41.739 --> 45:45.784
I'd like to discuss
this expedition of yours in more detail.

45:45.868 --> 45:49.913
Certainly, sir. I'll pick up my notes
and I'll come right over.

45:49.998 --> 45:52.708
I don't understand
these animal psychologists.

45:52.792 --> 45:55.502
What's Dr. Zira trying to prove?

45:55.586 --> 45:58.672
That man can be domesticated.

46:37.420 --> 46:40.839
- What happened?
- Oh, those fools and their torches.

46:40.923 --> 46:43.383
- Do you have any ointment?
- I'll see.

46:48.431 --> 46:50.599
I'm sorry, Bright Eyes.

46:56.439 --> 46:57.439
Julius!

47:00.485 --> 47:02.569
I told you what you'd get!

47:02.653 --> 47:04.029
Julius, don't, don't, don't!

47:04.113 --> 47:05.822
It doesn't matter!

47:05.907 --> 47:07.991
Julius, don't hurt him!

47:10.787 --> 47:11.953
Julius!

47:18.086 --> 47:20.462
Natural-born thieves, aren't they?

47:33.226 --> 47:36.311
Get me a collar and leash.

47:36.437 --> 47:39.981
- I'm taking him out of here.
- He's vicious, doctor.

47:40.066 --> 47:43.110
- Besides, it's against the rules.
- Do as I say!

47:54.497 --> 47:58.792
You... you wouldn't hurt me, would you,

48:01.087 --> 48:02.129
Taylor?

48:19.188 --> 48:21.314
It's a stunt.

48:21.399 --> 48:23.483
Humans can't write.

48:23.568 --> 48:25.652
Dear, you're a scientist.

48:25.736 --> 48:27.821
Don't you believe your own eyes?

48:32.118 --> 48:34.494
Where did you learn to do this?

48:37.707 --> 48:39.541
"Jefferson

48:39.625 --> 48:42.586
Public School."

48:48.551 --> 48:50.594
"Fort Wayne,

48:50.720 --> 48:52.762
Indiana."

48:55.725 --> 48:58.351
Back on that planet
you say you came from?

49:04.859 --> 49:06.943
Maybe he is intelligent.

49:07.028 --> 49:09.613
But he is also... crazy.

49:09.739 --> 49:11.573
Cornelius.

49:11.657 --> 49:13.742
Cornelius, please.

49:18.414 --> 49:21.249
"Dodge was killed in the hunt."

49:21.334 --> 49:24.586
"What happened to... Landon?"

49:26.339 --> 49:28.882
I don't know.

49:28.966 --> 49:31.760
They fell out of the sky with you?

49:36.057 --> 49:38.266
"Not fell. Flew."

49:38.351 --> 49:40.894
Flight is a scientific impossibility.

49:40.978 --> 49:44.189
And even if it weren't, why fly?

49:44.273 --> 49:46.358
Where would it get you?

50:03.167 --> 50:05.252
"Do you have maps?"

50:19.892 --> 50:22.936
We're here. You were captured here.

50:25.439 --> 50:27.524
You fell into the water here?

50:28.442 --> 50:30.527
You came ashore...

50:30.653 --> 50:32.696
Marched across the desert?

50:33.656 --> 50:35.740
Mountains?

50:36.534 --> 50:38.618
Many days and nights.

50:38.703 --> 50:41.329
And reached the jungle.

50:41.414 --> 50:43.915
Out of the question.

50:45.835 --> 50:49.045
Cornelius, why do you insist
on provoking him?

50:49.130 --> 50:54.634
No creature can survive in the forbidden
zone. I know. I've been there. I've seen it.

50:57.179 --> 50:59.264
"Then how do you account for me?"

51:00.016 --> 51:02.100
I don't.

51:02.184 --> 51:04.269
And I'm not going to try.

51:06.439 --> 51:09.357
But what about your theory?

51:10.276 --> 51:13.695
The existence of someone
like Taylor might prove it.

51:13.779 --> 51:16.072
Do you want to get my head chopped off?

51:16.157 --> 51:19.951
Don't be foolish.
If it's true, they'll have to accept it.

51:20.036 --> 51:22.120
No, they won't.

51:22.997 --> 51:26.291
Cornelius has developed
the most brilliant hypothesis.

51:26.375 --> 51:28.501
But I'm probably wrong.

51:28.586 --> 51:32.088
That the ape evolved from
a lower order of primate,

51:32.173 --> 51:34.299
possibly man.

51:34.383 --> 51:36.843
In his trip to the forbidden zone,

51:36.927 --> 51:41.181
he discovered traces
of a culture older than recorded time.

51:41.265 --> 51:45.018
- The evidence was very meager.
- You didn't think so then.

51:45.102 --> 51:49.397
That was before Dr. Zaius and half
of the Academy said my idea was heresy.

51:49.523 --> 51:52.067
How can scientific truth be heresy?

51:52.151 --> 51:55.695
What if Taylor is exactly
the proof you needed?

51:55.780 --> 51:57.864
A mutation.

51:57.948 --> 52:01.951
A missing link between
the unevolved primate

52:02.036 --> 52:03.745
and the ape.

52:05.247 --> 52:07.707
Touchy, isn't he?

52:09.126 --> 52:11.211
"I am not a missing link."

52:11.295 --> 52:16.341
Well, if he were a missing link, the sacred
scrolls wouldn't be worth their parchment.

52:16.425 --> 52:19.135
Well, maybe they're not.

52:19.220 --> 52:23.431
Oh, no, thank you.
I'm not going to get into that battle.

52:23.516 --> 52:27.310
- Cornelius, show some strength!
- Zira, listen to me!

52:27.395 --> 52:29.771
Now, we both have fine futures.

52:29.855 --> 52:32.023
Marriage, stimulating careers.

52:32.108 --> 52:34.192
I'm up for a raise.

52:35.403 --> 52:37.153
Dr. Zaius.

52:38.614 --> 52:41.449
Did you
forget our appointment, Cornelius?

52:41.575 --> 52:44.119
No, sir. I was just collecting my notes.

52:44.203 --> 52:48.540
You know Dr. Maximus, of course.
Our commissioner for animal affairs.

52:48.624 --> 52:51.376
Yes, sir. It's a pleasure to see you again.

52:51.460 --> 52:53.545
What is that?

52:53.629 --> 52:55.714
A man, Dr. Maximus.

52:55.798 --> 52:59.342
I know it's a man. And you know the rules.

52:59.427 --> 53:01.803
No animals allowed
outside the compound,

53:01.887 --> 53:04.472
and most especially not without a leash.

53:04.598 --> 53:06.641
Yes, sir, but... but this

53:06.809 --> 53:09.644
creature is a special case.

53:09.812 --> 53:12.105
Why special?

53:12.189 --> 53:14.482
We're conducting a new experiment.

53:14.608 --> 53:17.944
Wouldn't that more properly be done
in your office?

53:18.028 --> 53:19.654
Yes, sir.

53:19.780 --> 53:22.991
Guards, return this beast
to the compound.

53:24.034 --> 53:25.493
What is this?

53:28.581 --> 53:30.665
A toy.

53:30.791 --> 53:32.834
It floats on the air.

53:32.918 --> 53:34.586
Zira...

53:34.670 --> 53:35.962
Try it.

53:36.046 --> 53:38.131
Nonsense.

53:55.232 --> 53:59.277
- What's up, lieutenant?
- We're taking number four to surgery.

53:59.361 --> 54:01.321
- Have him ready.
- How come?

54:01.405 --> 54:05.617
- The beast's throat's nearly healed.
- The vet's going to geld him.

54:05.701 --> 54:09.329
Dr. Zira won't like it.
She wants that pair to mate.

54:09.413 --> 54:14.417
These orders come from Dr. Zaius himself.
There's nothing she can do about it.

54:29.517 --> 54:32.560
If only you knew what they're going to do.

54:34.563 --> 54:37.315
Stay still now. Don't give me any trouble.

55:10.724 --> 55:14.978
Weep if you must,
but make an end of sorrow.

55:15.104 --> 55:17.146
He lives again.

55:18.023 --> 55:21.317
Yes, he has found peace in heaven.

55:23.028 --> 55:27.782
He was a model for us all,
a gorilla to remember...

55:28.617 --> 55:31.202
Hunter, warrior,

55:31.287 --> 55:33.371
defender of the faith.

55:34.373 --> 55:36.457
Cherished husband,

55:36.542 --> 55:38.626
beloved father,

55:38.711 --> 55:41.337
generous master, yes.

55:42.172 --> 55:43.631
He was

55:43.716 --> 55:46.050
a font of simian kindness.

55:47.636 --> 55:54.601
The dear departed once said to me
"I never met an ape I didn't like."

55:55.603 --> 55:57.979
Look! It's a man!

55:58.063 --> 56:01.149
In heaven's name! Get rid of that creature!

56:01.233 --> 56:03.318
Catch him!

56:05.821 --> 56:07.989
Catch him! Catch him!

57:38.080 --> 57:40.123
Come on, Quintus.

59:52.256 --> 59:54.340
- Go get him!
- Taylor!

59:54.424 --> 59:56.717
- Why did you run away?
- Security police.

59:56.802 --> 59:58.886
I'm in charge of this man.

59:58.971 --> 01:00:01.597
He is in the custody
of the ministry of science.

01:00:01.682 --> 01:00:04.559
Take your stinking paws off me,

01:00:04.643 --> 01:00:07.019
you damn dirty ape!

01:00:16.905 --> 01:00:19.031
No one'll listen to me.

01:00:21.285 --> 01:00:23.411
Only you.

01:00:26.248 --> 01:00:28.291
You.

01:00:29.042 --> 01:00:31.294
Nova.

01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:33.921
You... Nova.

01:00:34.047 --> 01:00:36.090
No...

01:00:38.135 --> 01:00:40.261
Yeah. Me Tarzan, you Jane.

01:00:49.104 --> 01:00:50.688
What are you doing?

01:00:50.772 --> 01:00:52.148
Leave her alone,

01:00:52.274 --> 01:00:53.357
damn you!

01:00:53.442 --> 01:01:07.121
Where are you taking her?

01:01:21.053 --> 01:01:23.888
Damn you! You hairy scum!

01:01:23.972 --> 01:01:26.098
Shut up, you freak!

01:01:26.183 --> 01:01:28.059
Julius, you...

01:01:28.143 --> 01:01:29.852
I said shut up!

01:01:29.937 --> 01:01:31.729
It's a madhouse!

01:01:32.731 --> 01:01:34.732
A madhouse!

01:01:47.162 --> 01:01:49.288
Now I don't even have you.

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:53.084
Imagine me needing someone.

01:01:53.168 --> 01:01:57.129
Back on Earth I never did.
Oh, there were women. Lots of women.

01:01:57.214 --> 01:02:00.341
Lots of... lovemaking, but no love.

01:02:00.425 --> 01:02:03.386
That was the kind of world we'd made.

01:02:03.512 --> 01:02:05.554
So I left

01:02:05.639 --> 01:02:08.516
because there was no one
to hold me there.

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:10.685
Did I tell you about Stewart?

01:02:10.769 --> 01:02:13.479
Now there was a lovely girl.

01:02:13.563 --> 01:02:16.440
The most precious cargo
we'd brought along.

01:02:16.525 --> 01:02:20.027
She was... to be the new Eve.

01:02:20.153 --> 01:02:23.781
With our hot and eager help, of course.

01:02:25.325 --> 01:02:28.536
Probably just as well
she didn't make it this far.

01:02:32.165 --> 01:02:34.208
Do you love me, I wonder?

01:02:34.334 --> 01:02:37.837
Can you love, I wonder?

01:02:44.386 --> 01:02:46.470
Well...

01:02:46.555 --> 01:02:49.765
You're not as smart as Stewart, but

01:02:49.850 --> 01:02:51.934
you're the only girl in town.

01:02:57.649 --> 01:03:00.151
Look at that. I...

01:03:00.235 --> 01:03:02.445
I taught you to smile.

01:04:26.321 --> 01:04:30.533
It's been weeks.
What happened? Where have you been?

01:04:30.659 --> 01:04:32.701
Why didn't you come to see me?

01:04:32.786 --> 01:04:34.870
- What is this?
- A hearing.

01:04:34.955 --> 01:04:37.456
- Be clever. Be quiet.
- All rise!

01:04:46.967 --> 01:04:48.175
Be seated!

01:04:51.263 --> 01:04:54.890
This ad hoc tribunal of
the National Academy is now in session.

01:04:54.975 --> 01:04:57.601
The president of the Academy presiding.

01:04:57.686 --> 01:05:02.606
On my right, Dr. Maximus, commissioner
for animal affairs. And on my left,

01:05:02.691 --> 01:05:07.653
Dr. Zaius, minister of science
and chief defender of the faith.

01:05:07.737 --> 01:05:12.116
And appearing for the state,
Dr. Honorious, deputy minister ofjustice.

01:05:16.288 --> 01:05:20.207
Bailiff! Your instructions:
To clean up the beast.

01:05:20.292 --> 01:05:25.588
These rags he's wearing give off a stench
that's offensive to the dignity

01:05:25.714 --> 01:05:28.090
of this tribunal.

01:05:36.558 --> 01:05:38.434
You may proceed,

01:05:38.602 --> 01:05:41.687
- Dr. Honorious.
- By your leave, Mr. President,

01:05:41.771 --> 01:05:46.025
this tribunal has not yet defined
the purpose for this inquiry.

01:05:47.903 --> 01:05:51.238
You asked for the opportunity
to present your case.

01:05:51.323 --> 01:05:53.741
Surely you must know why you're here.

01:05:53.825 --> 01:05:56.494
At the very least,
this man has the right to know

01:05:56.578 --> 01:05:58.829
whether there's a charge against him.

01:05:58.914 --> 01:05:59.955
Objection!

01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:03.042
This exhibit is indeed a man.

01:06:03.126 --> 01:06:05.753
Therefore he has no rights under ape law.

01:06:06.671 --> 01:06:09.089
Dr. Zira, this is a man,

01:06:09.174 --> 01:06:13.385
- is it not?
- He is unlike any man you have ever seen.

01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:15.596
As we hope to prove.

01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:19.016
Answer the question, Dr. Zira. Is it a man?

01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:22.978
Sir, perhaps the... question
is the point at issue.

01:06:23.063 --> 01:06:25.689
Is he a man, is he a deviant,

01:06:25.774 --> 01:06:27.858
or... a freak of nature?

01:06:27.943 --> 01:06:30.027
- Objection!
- Sustained.

01:06:30.111 --> 01:06:33.280
Now, Dr. Zira, in all fairness,

01:06:33.406 --> 01:06:36.200
you must admit that
the accused is a non-ape

01:06:36.284 --> 01:06:38.994
and therefore has no rights under ape law.

01:06:39.079 --> 01:06:41.205
Then why is he called the accused?

01:06:41.289 --> 01:06:44.458
Your Honors must think him
guilty of something.

01:06:46.878 --> 01:06:51.298
The creature's not being tried.
He's being disposed of.

01:06:51.383 --> 01:06:55.094
It is scientific heresy
that is being tried here.

01:06:55.178 --> 01:06:57.221
Well put, Dr. Zaius.

01:06:57.305 --> 01:06:59.765
Let us warn our friends

01:06:59.849 --> 01:07:04.019
that they endanger their own careers
by defending this animal.

01:07:05.272 --> 01:07:07.481
Then I'll... defend myself.

01:07:11.236 --> 01:07:13.821
Dr. Zira, would you tell

01:07:13.905 --> 01:07:16.198
Bright Eyes to be quiet?

01:07:16.283 --> 01:07:19.034
- My name is Taylor!
- Bailiff! Silence the animal!

01:07:20.328 --> 01:07:22.454
Wait! Let me...

01:07:25.333 --> 01:07:27.418
You may proceed, Mr. Prosecutor.

01:07:27.502 --> 01:07:31.005
Learned judges, my case is simple.

01:07:31.089 --> 01:07:33.716
It is based on our first article of faith.

01:07:33.842 --> 01:07:37.177
That the almighty created the ape
in his own image.

01:07:37.262 --> 01:07:39.722
That he gave him a soul and a mind.

01:07:39.848 --> 01:07:42.182
That he set him apart
from the beasts of the jungle

01:07:42.267 --> 01:07:45.269
and made him the lord of the planet.

01:07:45.353 --> 01:07:47.896
These sacred truths are self-evident.

01:07:48.773 --> 01:07:51.692
The proper study of apes is apes.

01:07:53.278 --> 01:07:56.530
But certain young cynics
have chosen to study man.

01:07:57.365 --> 01:08:03.579
Yes! Perverted scientists who advance
an insidious theory called evolution.

01:08:03.705 --> 01:08:06.373
Come to the point, Dr. Honorious.

01:08:06.458 --> 01:08:10.753
The state charges that Dr. Zira
and a corrupt surgeon named Galen

01:08:10.879 --> 01:08:13.672
experimented on this wounded animal,

01:08:13.757 --> 01:08:16.216
tampering with his brain
and throat tissues,

01:08:16.301 --> 01:08:18.801
to produce a speaking monster.

01:08:18.886 --> 01:08:20.304
That's a lie!

01:08:20.388 --> 01:08:22.055
Mind your tongue, madam.

01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:25.184
Did we create his mind as well?

01:08:25.268 --> 01:08:27.310
Not only can this man speak,

01:08:27.395 --> 01:08:30.064
he can think! He can reason.

01:08:32.317 --> 01:08:34.401
That can reason?

01:08:34.486 --> 01:08:40.073
With the tribunal's permission, allow me
to expose this hoax by direct examination.

01:08:40.158 --> 01:08:43.577
Proceed, doctor. But do not
turn this hearing into a farce.

01:08:50.835 --> 01:08:55.046
Tell the court, Bright Eyes,
what is the second article of faith?

01:08:56.424 --> 01:08:59.426
I know nothing of your culture.
I admit that.

01:08:59.511 --> 01:09:03.639
Of course he doesn't know our culture,
because he cannot think!

01:09:05.100 --> 01:09:08.727
Tell us... Why are all apes created equal?

01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:12.564
Some apes, it seems,
are more equal than others.

01:09:12.649 --> 01:09:13.732
Ridiculous!

01:09:13.817 --> 01:09:15.901
Tell us, Bright Eyes.

01:09:15.984 --> 01:09:18.069
Why do men have no souls?

01:09:18.154 --> 01:09:22.282
What is the proof that a divine spark
exists in the simian brain?

01:09:31.835 --> 01:09:33.961
Read this for me.

01:09:43.846 --> 01:09:48.015
Since the defendant has been forbidden
to speak in his own defense,

01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:51.395
he requests that the following statement

01:09:51.479 --> 01:09:53.564
be read into the record.

01:09:53.648 --> 01:09:56.275
You read it, Dr. Cornelius. Read it.

01:10:00.196 --> 01:10:04.658
"I have, uh, come to you from a planet
in a different solar system."

01:10:04.784 --> 01:10:07.327
"I am an explorer in space..."

01:10:07.412 --> 01:10:09.997
Stop right there. Let me see that paper.

01:10:16.337 --> 01:10:18.505
It's a joke.

01:10:19.382 --> 01:10:21.425
In very poor taste.

01:10:21.509 --> 01:10:24.344
Is it a joke
to seek the truth about this man?

01:10:24.429 --> 01:10:25.679
Dr. Zira,

01:10:25.805 --> 01:10:28.432
you state here that a ship
from outer space

01:10:28.516 --> 01:10:31.643
sank in an inland sea
of our eastern desert.

01:10:31.728 --> 01:10:35.439
You state that Bright Eyes had
two intelligent companions with him

01:10:35.523 --> 01:10:37.524
at the time of his capture.

01:10:37.609 --> 01:10:39.526
That is his assertion.

01:10:39.652 --> 01:10:41.695
Mr. President,

01:10:41.821 --> 01:10:46.784
in addition to Bright Eyes,
I believe the prosecutor has reassembled

01:10:46.868 --> 01:10:50.662
all the surviving humans
that were captured in the hunt.

01:10:50.747 --> 01:10:52.623
That's true, Dr. Zaius.

01:10:52.707 --> 01:10:54.750
Very well.

01:10:54.876 --> 01:10:57.836
Then I suggest that we...
go take a look at 'em.

01:11:36.376 --> 01:11:38.502
That's him! That's Landon!

01:11:38.586 --> 01:11:41.088
- Which one?
- The tall one in the back.

01:11:43.132 --> 01:11:46.760
Do you acknowledge kinship
with any of these creatures?

01:11:46.886 --> 01:11:50.597
- With one of them, yes.
- Identify him, then. Speak to him.

01:11:52.684 --> 01:11:54.768
Landon?

01:11:55.937 --> 01:11:56.937
Landon.

01:12:02.318 --> 01:12:04.611
Oh! They cut him!

01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:09.324
Did you know about this?

01:12:09.409 --> 01:12:13.078
No. I... I swear.
I never saw this man before.

01:12:13.162 --> 01:12:15.247
But they...

01:12:16.916 --> 01:12:18.041
You did it.

01:12:19.210 --> 01:12:22.254
You cut up his brain, you bloody baboon!

01:12:22.338 --> 01:12:24.423
Stop him!

01:12:35.643 --> 01:12:37.185
Take him inside!

01:13:18.603 --> 01:13:21.688
Mr. President, a word of explanation.

01:13:21.814 --> 01:13:24.566
The human specimen you saw outside

01:13:24.651 --> 01:13:28.153
suffered a skull fracture
in the course of the hunt.

01:13:28.237 --> 01:13:33.450
Two fine veterinary surgeons under
my direction were able to save his life.

01:13:33.534 --> 01:13:36.036
But the beast could not speak, of course.

01:13:36.204 --> 01:13:38.246
Nor will he ever speak.

01:13:38.331 --> 01:13:40.415
You did that to him, damn you!

01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:44.252
Cut out his memory, took his identity,
and that's what you wanna do to me!

01:13:44.337 --> 01:13:46.171
Bailiff! Gag the animal!

01:13:46.255 --> 01:13:48.340
Damn you!

01:13:50.593 --> 01:13:52.636
May it please the tribunal,

01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:56.723
I grant you that this creature
cannot have come from another planet.

01:13:56.808 --> 01:14:01.061
But this much is certain. He does come
from somewhere in the forbidden zone.

01:14:01.145 --> 01:14:04.189
He's described the region to us
and described it accurately for...

01:14:04.273 --> 01:14:05.732
I have been there.

01:14:05.817 --> 01:14:07.859
You visited the forbidden zone?

01:14:07.944 --> 01:14:09.277
Yes, sir.

01:14:09.362 --> 01:14:11.905
A year ago.
With the permission of the Academy.

01:14:12.031 --> 01:14:13.115
He exceeded his orders.

01:14:13.199 --> 01:14:16.326
His travel permit
was canceled immediately.

01:14:16.411 --> 01:14:18.495
Yes, sir. That is true, thanks to you.

01:14:18.579 --> 01:14:21.206
But not before I discovered evidence

01:14:21.290 --> 01:14:25.961
of a simian culture that existed long
before the sacred scrolls were written.

01:14:26.087 --> 01:14:29.840
Objection! These remarks
are profane and irrelevant!

01:14:29.924 --> 01:14:32.884
Sustained. Your archaeological theories
have no bearing

01:14:32.969 --> 01:14:35.679
on the disposition of this creature.

01:14:35.763 --> 01:14:38.765
Let them talk, Mr. President.
Let them talk.

01:14:38.850 --> 01:14:43.311
Sirs, our theories
have a bearing on his identity.

01:14:43.396 --> 01:14:45.272
How so?

01:14:45.356 --> 01:14:48.859
Let us assume, as common sense dictates,

01:14:48.943 --> 01:14:51.987
that the prisoner's story is false.

01:14:52.113 --> 01:14:55.490
But if he did not come
from another planet,

01:14:55.575 --> 01:14:58.577
then surely he sprang from our own.

01:15:00.121 --> 01:15:03.123
Yes! Sprang! As an animal psychologist,

01:15:03.291 --> 01:15:08.712
I have found no physiological defect
to explain why humans are mute.

01:15:08.796 --> 01:15:10.672
- Objection!
- Sustained!

01:15:10.757 --> 01:15:12.591
Their speech organs are adequate.

01:15:12.675 --> 01:15:15.927
The flaw lies not in anatomy,
but in the brain.

01:15:16.012 --> 01:15:18.096
- Objection!
- Sustained!

01:15:18.181 --> 01:15:21.808
Sustain all objections, but face the truth!

01:15:21.893 --> 01:15:24.394
Yes! Behold this marvel!

01:15:24.479 --> 01:15:26.563
This living paradox!

01:15:26.647 --> 01:15:29.191
This missing link in an evolutionary chain!

01:15:29.317 --> 01:15:30.901
Silence there!

01:15:30.985 --> 01:15:32.152
You go too far.

01:15:32.236 --> 01:15:34.696
I think an indictment is in order.

01:15:34.781 --> 01:15:39.910
Yes, sir. The state charges Drs. Zira and
Cornelius with contempt of this tribunal,

01:15:39.994 --> 01:15:42.412
malicious mischief, and scientific heresy.

01:15:42.497 --> 01:15:44.623
It is so ordered.

01:15:45.583 --> 01:15:49.920
This tribunal will examine the evidence
and in due course render its verdict.

01:15:50.004 --> 01:15:53.715
As to the proposed indictment
and as to the disposition

01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:56.301
of the deviate in question,

01:15:56.385 --> 01:15:58.011
this hearing is adjourned.

01:16:45.893 --> 01:16:47.978
Wait outside.

01:16:58.781 --> 01:17:00.866
Well, the verdict is in.

01:17:02.451 --> 01:17:07.914
At the moment, your two simian friends
and sponsors are free on bail.

01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:11.126
But they'll soon be brought to trial
for heresy.

01:17:11.252 --> 01:17:13.295
What about me?

01:17:13.421 --> 01:17:17.007
Your case was preordained.

01:17:17.091 --> 01:17:19.926
In a way, you did the state a service

01:17:20.011 --> 01:17:24.931
because you made it possible for us
to expose Zira and Cornelius.

01:17:25.016 --> 01:17:29.060
Now the tribunal
has placed you in my custody

01:17:29.145 --> 01:17:31.271
for final disposition.

01:17:32.607 --> 01:17:34.900
Do you realize what that means?

01:17:35.943 --> 01:17:37.194
No.

01:17:37.278 --> 01:17:39.821
Emasculation to begin with.

01:17:39.906 --> 01:17:42.115
Then experimental surgery

01:17:42.241 --> 01:17:44.743
on the speech centers - on the brain.

01:17:44.827 --> 01:17:47.537
Eventually a kind of living death.

01:17:50.249 --> 01:17:52.292
However,

01:17:53.753 --> 01:17:56.463
I have it in my power to grant a reprieve.

01:17:57.298 --> 01:17:59.841
That is why I summoned you here tonight.

01:18:01.302 --> 01:18:05.555
Tell me who and what you really are
and where you came from,

01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:07.891
and no veterinary shall touch you.

01:18:07.975 --> 01:18:10.602
I told you that at that hearing of yours.

01:18:10.686 --> 01:18:12.771
You lied!

01:18:12.855 --> 01:18:14.898
Where is your tribe?

01:18:14.982 --> 01:18:17.067
My tribe!

01:18:17.151 --> 01:18:20.612
They live on another planet
in another solar system.

01:18:20.696 --> 01:18:24.115
Even in your lies,
some truth slips through.

01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:27.202
That mythical community
you're supposed to come from -

01:18:27.286 --> 01:18:28.620
Fort Wayne.

01:18:28.704 --> 01:18:30.789
- What about it?
- A fort!

01:18:31.582 --> 01:18:35.085
Unconsciously you chose a name
that was belligerent.

01:18:35.169 --> 01:18:37.212
Where were you nurtured?

01:18:38.172 --> 01:18:41.967
Then... you don't believe
that prosecutor's charge

01:18:42.051 --> 01:18:45.011
that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira?

01:18:45.137 --> 01:18:47.180
Certainly not.

01:18:49.183 --> 01:18:51.726
You're a mutant.

01:18:51.811 --> 01:18:55.897
That's what Zira and Cornelius claim.
You're talking heresy, doctor.

01:18:55.982 --> 01:18:58.024
Of course!

01:18:58.150 --> 01:19:02.112
Suppose I am a mutant.
How can the appearance of one mutant

01:19:02.196 --> 01:19:05.365
- send you into a panic?
- Because you're not unique.

01:19:05.449 --> 01:19:08.952
- There's the one you call Landon.
- Oh. Then you admit that...

01:19:09.036 --> 01:19:12.998
I admit that where there's one mutant,
there's probably another and another.

01:19:13.082 --> 01:19:15.375
A whole nest of them.

01:19:16.043 --> 01:19:18.211
Where is your nest, Taylor?

01:19:18.337 --> 01:19:20.380
Where are your women?

01:19:20.464 --> 01:19:22.590
Thank you.

01:19:22.675 --> 01:19:24.801
Thank you for calling me Taylor.

01:19:24.885 --> 01:19:26.970
Dr. Zaius,

01:19:27.054 --> 01:19:29.139
I know who I am.

01:19:29.223 --> 01:19:31.266
But who are you?

01:19:31.392 --> 01:19:35.228
How in hell did this upside-down
civilization get started?

01:19:35.354 --> 01:19:38.606
You may well call it upside down,

01:19:38.691 --> 01:19:41.067
since you occupy its lowest level.

01:19:41.193 --> 01:19:43.236
And deservedly so.

01:19:45.740 --> 01:19:48.783
Our eastern desert
has never been explored

01:19:49.410 --> 01:19:53.872
because we've always assumed
that life cannot exist there.

01:19:53.956 --> 01:19:57.083
Taylor, save yourself!

01:19:57.209 --> 01:20:02.088
Tell me, is there another jungle
beyond the forbidden zone?

01:20:02.173 --> 01:20:04.382
I don't know.

01:20:04.467 --> 01:20:09.637
If you're trying to protect others
of your kind, it'll cost you your identity.

01:20:09.722 --> 01:20:11.806
I'm not protecting anyone.

01:20:11.891 --> 01:20:14.476
This whole thing is insane!
What have I done?

01:20:20.441 --> 01:20:22.817
You are a menace.

01:20:22.902 --> 01:20:25.195
A walking pestilence!

01:20:25.279 --> 01:20:28.198
I do know who you are, Taylor.

01:20:30.201 --> 01:20:33.995
I'll give you just six hours
to make a full confession.

01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:36.956
After that
I shall use surgery to obtain one.

01:20:37.041 --> 01:20:38.375
Guards!

01:20:38.459 --> 01:20:41.753
All right. You can cut pieces out of me.
You've got the power.

01:20:41.837 --> 01:20:44.130
Return this creature to his cage.

01:20:44.215 --> 01:20:46.216
But you do it out of fear!

01:20:46.300 --> 01:20:48.301
Remember that!
Because you're afraid of me!

01:20:48.386 --> 01:20:51.262
What are you afraid of, doctor?

01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:15.245
Are you Julius?

01:21:15.329 --> 01:21:19.332
- Who are you?
- I'm from the office of animal affairs.

01:21:21.669 --> 01:21:24.254
That male is to be transferred to the zoo.

01:21:24.338 --> 01:21:26.089
At this hour?

01:21:26.173 --> 01:21:27.924
Who says so?

01:21:28.008 --> 01:21:30.260
Don't they tell you anything?

01:21:30.344 --> 01:21:34.180
The antivivisectionist society
is up in arms.

01:21:34.306 --> 01:21:38.268
They're gonna save this beast
from those butchers in the lab.

01:21:38.352 --> 01:21:42.522
If he can speak, he belongs in a public zoo,
but what'll probably happen

01:21:42.606 --> 01:21:47.068
is some money-mad grown-up'll put him
in a circus, and we'll have to pay...

01:21:47.153 --> 01:21:49.946
Stop making speeches
and show me the order!

01:22:05.713 --> 01:22:08.214
This order's no good.

01:22:09.341 --> 01:22:12.093
It must be countersigned by Dr. Zaius.

01:22:13.053 --> 01:22:14.137
Grab him!

01:22:19.852 --> 01:22:21.102
Who are you?

01:22:21.187 --> 01:22:23.229
So you can talk!

01:22:23.355 --> 01:22:26.608
I'm Dr. Zira's nephew.
This abduction was her idea.

01:22:26.734 --> 01:22:28.985
You're not really going to the zoo.

01:22:29.069 --> 01:22:31.237
That's our story if somebody stops us.

01:22:31.363 --> 01:22:33.406
Get me out of this.

01:22:35.409 --> 01:22:37.869
We've gotta move fast!

01:22:40.915 --> 01:22:42.415
She comes along too.

01:22:42.541 --> 01:22:45.418
- Zira doesn't want your female.
- I want her.

01:22:46.378 --> 01:22:49.255
If you insist, but I'm not taking any orders.

01:22:49.340 --> 01:22:51.424
All right. Come on! Let's go!

01:23:14.156 --> 01:23:18.117
- I told you not to bring the other one!
- He wouldn't leave her.

01:23:18.202 --> 01:23:20.286
Oh, all right. Come on!

01:23:28.003 --> 01:23:31.464
- Here. Put this on.
- Don't you have any clothes for me?

01:23:31.590 --> 01:23:34.008
What do you expect? An ape's new suit?

01:23:34.969 --> 01:23:38.221
- This stuff stinks!
- Well, so do you. Like all men.

01:23:38.305 --> 01:23:40.390
Taylor, remember,

01:23:40.474 --> 01:23:42.600
all men look alike to most apes.

01:23:42.685 --> 01:23:44.102
So put it on and keep quiet,

01:23:44.186 --> 01:23:47.105
and we may just
get away with this. Hurry!

01:24:38.032 --> 01:24:40.366
Cornelius!

01:24:48.792 --> 01:24:50.084
How'd it go?

01:24:52.546 --> 01:24:53.671
Come on!

01:24:53.756 --> 01:24:55.882
Let me out of this!

01:25:04.892 --> 01:25:07.393
Well, Taylor, we're all fugitives now.

01:25:07.519 --> 01:25:10.313
Do you have any weapons? Any guns?

01:25:10.397 --> 01:25:12.523
The best. But we won't need them.

01:25:12.608 --> 01:25:15.068
I'm glad to hear it. I want one anyway.

01:25:23.952 --> 01:25:26.412
Taylor, I'm in charge of this expedition!

01:25:26.497 --> 01:25:27.497
Good for you.

01:25:27.581 --> 01:25:30.333
But you're not in charge of me.
Not any more.

01:25:30.417 --> 01:25:32.543
I don't plan to be caught again.

01:25:34.546 --> 01:25:37.715
- As you wish.
- Dr. Zaius seemed to think there was

01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:40.635
another jungle beyond the forbidden zone.

01:25:40.761 --> 01:25:42.804
I'll try for that. What about you?

01:25:42.930 --> 01:25:45.723
Cornelius and I have been
indicted for heresy.

01:25:45.808 --> 01:25:49.811
Unless we can prove our theories,
we don't stand a chance of acquittal.

01:25:49.937 --> 01:25:52.188
You're going back to the forbidden zone?

01:25:52.272 --> 01:25:55.525
We're going back to the diggings
I worked at over a year ago.

01:25:55.609 --> 01:25:57.819
It's a three-day ride across the desert.

01:25:57.945 --> 01:26:01.114
Near where you claim you landed
from that planet of yours.

01:26:01.198 --> 01:26:04.992
- You still don't believe me, do you?
- It's a long detour to Dead Lake.

01:26:05.077 --> 01:26:07.161
- What would we find?
- Nothing much.

01:26:07.246 --> 01:26:12.750
An empty rubber life raft. Maybe a...
little flag, the emblem of my countrymen.

01:26:13.794 --> 01:26:16.170
The terrain around that lake is poisonous.

01:26:16.255 --> 01:26:20.425
There's no fresh water,
no vegetation - nothing.

01:26:23.679 --> 01:26:27.974
Anyway, I... ought to thank you
for saving me. You'll be in trouble for that.

01:26:29.643 --> 01:26:32.812
We've been in trouble
since the moment we met you.

01:26:36.483 --> 01:26:38.568
What's she pointing at?

01:26:38.652 --> 01:26:41.654
This must be close to home for her.
She knows it.

01:26:45.701 --> 01:26:48.119
Nova, no. Nova!

01:26:48.203 --> 01:26:51.164
Nova, you can't go there!
It's not safe! Nova!

01:26:55.127 --> 01:26:56.669
We'd better get started.

01:26:56.754 --> 01:26:59.839
If the mounted police pick up our trail,
they'll come this far.

01:26:59.923 --> 01:27:03.676
Right. Let's get the water
and provisions into the wagon.

01:28:15.666 --> 01:28:17.750
Cornelius!

01:28:20.921 --> 01:28:23.005
Where does this river lead to?

01:28:23.090 --> 01:28:28.177
It flows into a sea some miles from here.
That's where we'll find the diggings.

01:28:28.262 --> 01:28:30.346
And beyond that?

01:28:30.430 --> 01:28:34.308
I don't know. You can't ride
along the shore at high tide

01:28:34.393 --> 01:28:37.270
and we had no boats
on our last expedition.

01:28:37.354 --> 01:28:40.940
You never told me -
why do you call this the forbidden zone?

01:28:41.817 --> 01:28:47.488
No one knows. It's an ancient taboo,
set forth in the sacred scrolls.

01:28:47.573 --> 01:28:50.741
The lawgiver pronounced
this whole area deadly.

01:28:52.953 --> 01:28:55.037
Shouldn't we be moving on?

01:28:55.706 --> 01:28:57.790
I'm for that.

01:30:26.546 --> 01:30:28.631
Well? Do you like it?

01:30:33.595 --> 01:30:36.222
Why did you do that? Scrape off your hair?

01:30:36.306 --> 01:30:40.059
In my world, when I left it,
only kids your age wore beards.

01:30:40.894 --> 01:30:42.436
Beards?

01:30:42.521 --> 01:30:44.605
I don't go in for fads.

01:30:45.482 --> 01:30:47.650
Somehow

01:30:47.734 --> 01:30:50.236
it makes you look less intelligent.

01:30:51.238 --> 01:30:53.823
When will you show me
what's in that cave?

01:30:53.907 --> 01:30:56.033
Right now, if you like.

01:31:15.846 --> 01:31:16.929
Cornelius!

01:31:27.607 --> 01:31:31.152
- Lucius, don't fire at them!
- You're all under arrest!

01:31:35.449 --> 01:31:38.868
If there's any more shooting,
Dr. Zaius, you'll be the first to go.

01:31:38.952 --> 01:31:40.703
You can count on it.

01:31:40.787 --> 01:31:43.205
You are not in command.
Put down that gun.

01:31:43.290 --> 01:31:44.457
Shut up!

01:31:44.541 --> 01:31:46.500
Very well.

01:31:46.877 --> 01:31:48.210
Lower your weapons.

01:31:48.295 --> 01:31:51.964
Tell them to pull back around the rocks,
out of range.

01:31:52.758 --> 01:31:54.800
Withdraw!

01:31:59.639 --> 01:32:01.724
How did you know we'd come here?

01:32:01.808 --> 01:32:06.479
It wasn't difficult. Only an apostate
would flee to the forbidden zone.

01:32:06.563 --> 01:32:09.774
And only a fool
would give a gun to an animal.

01:32:10.734 --> 01:32:13.819
I see you've brought
the female of your species.

01:32:13.945 --> 01:32:17.698
I didn't realize
that man could be monogamous.

01:32:17.783 --> 01:32:19.825
On this planet it's easy.

01:32:20.994 --> 01:32:24.747
I'll ask you to reconsider
the rash course you've undertaken.

01:32:24.831 --> 01:32:30.252
If you're convicted of heresy,
the most you'll get is two years, but

01:32:30.337 --> 01:32:35.591
if you persist in pointing guns in
my direction, you'll hang for high treason.

01:32:35.675 --> 01:32:38.302
We never meant to be treasonous, sir.

01:32:38.386 --> 01:32:42.556
But up there, in the face of that cliff,
there is a vast cave,

01:32:42.641 --> 01:32:46.685
and in that cave a fabulous treasure
of fossils and artifacts.

01:32:46.770 --> 01:32:50.481
I've seen some of your fossils
and artifacts. They're worthless.

01:32:50.565 --> 01:32:52.650
There's your minister of science.

01:32:52.734 --> 01:32:55.861
Honor-bound to expand
the frontiers of knowledge.

01:32:55.946 --> 01:32:58.114
- Taylor, please!
- Except he's also chief defender

01:32:58.198 --> 01:32:59.698
of the faith.

01:32:59.783 --> 01:33:03.994
There is no contradiction
between faith and science - true science.

01:33:04.079 --> 01:33:07.540
- Are you willing to put it to the test?
- Taylor, I would rather...

01:33:07.624 --> 01:33:11.794
Take it easy. You saved me from
this fanatic. Maybe I can return the favor.

01:33:11.878 --> 01:33:14.004
What is your proposal?

01:33:14.798 --> 01:33:17.967
When were those sacred scrolls
of yours written?

01:33:18.051 --> 01:33:19.802
1,200 years ago.

01:33:19.886 --> 01:33:24.974
All right. If they can prove those scrolls
don't tell the whole truth of your history,

01:33:25.058 --> 01:33:27.351
if they can find some real evidence

01:33:27.435 --> 01:33:31.188
of another culture from some remote past,
will you let them off?

01:33:31.273 --> 01:33:34.233
- Of course.
- Let's go up to the cave.

01:33:39.614 --> 01:33:42.908
Sorry, Lucius. You've got to stay here
and guard the camp.

01:33:43.034 --> 01:33:46.120
Always giving orders.
Just like every other adult.

01:33:46.246 --> 01:33:48.789
Relax. You'll get to see it all later on.

01:34:50.894 --> 01:34:53.395
Present your evidence, Cornelius.

01:34:53.480 --> 01:34:58.734
It was at this level that I discovered
traces of an early ape creature.

01:34:58.818 --> 01:35:04.490
A stage of primitive barbarism really,
dating back some 1,300 years roughly.

01:35:04.616 --> 01:35:10.162
It was at this level... I discovered
cutting tools and arrowheads of quartz

01:35:10.288 --> 01:35:13.791
and the fossilized bones
of carnivorous gorillas.

01:35:14.542 --> 01:35:17.086
But the artifacts

01:35:17.170 --> 01:35:19.338
lying here

01:35:20.423 --> 01:35:23.342
were found at this level,

01:35:23.426 --> 01:35:26.512
and date back... 700 years earlier.

01:35:26.638 --> 01:35:28.722
That's the paradox.

01:35:28.807 --> 01:35:32.393
For the more ancient culture
is the more advanced.

01:35:32.519 --> 01:35:36.355
Now, admittedly,
many of these objects are unidentified.

01:35:36.439 --> 01:35:40.693
But clearly they were fashioned
by beings with a knowledge of metallurgy.

01:35:40.777 --> 01:35:44.989
Indeed, the fact that many of these tools
are unknown to us

01:35:45.115 --> 01:35:49.660
suggests a culture which
in certain ways equals our own.

01:35:49.744 --> 01:35:52.246
Some of the evidence is uncontestable.

01:35:52.372 --> 01:35:56.166
Don't speak to me in absolutes.
The evidence is contestable!

01:35:57.377 --> 01:35:59.128
I apologize, sir.

01:35:59.212 --> 01:36:03.382
To begin with, your methods of dating
the past are crude to say the least.

01:36:03.466 --> 01:36:07.386
There are geologists on my staff
who'd laugh at your speculations.

01:36:07.470 --> 01:36:09.555
But there's the doll, sir.

01:36:09.639 --> 01:36:11.765
What?

01:36:11.850 --> 01:36:14.351
Oh, lying right there. The human doll.

01:36:21.026 --> 01:36:25.279
What does this prove?
My granddaughter plays with human dolls.

01:36:27.073 --> 01:36:29.950
The doll was found
beside the jawbone of a man

01:36:30.035 --> 01:36:33.662
and no trace of simian fossil
has been found in this deposit.

01:36:33.788 --> 01:36:35.873
Your conclusion is premature.

01:36:35.957 --> 01:36:39.084
Have you forgotten your scripture?
The 13th scroll?

01:36:39.210 --> 01:36:44.214
"And Proteus brought the upright beast
into the garden and chained him to a tree,

01:36:44.299 --> 01:36:48.594
- and the children did make sport of him."
- No, sir, I have not forgotten.

01:36:48.678 --> 01:36:53.182
Well, for a time the ancients
kept humans as household pets

01:36:53.266 --> 01:36:57.269
until our lawgiver proved
that man could not be tamed.

01:36:58.229 --> 01:36:59.563
Keep digging, Cornelius.

01:36:59.647 --> 01:37:03.275
You'll find evidence
of the master of this house...

01:37:04.652 --> 01:37:06.987
An ape.

01:37:09.407 --> 01:37:11.033
What are you doing?

01:37:11.117 --> 01:37:14.119
Reconstructing a past life.

01:37:15.705 --> 01:37:19.124
You say these things were found
at the same level as that doll?

01:37:19.250 --> 01:37:22.836
Whoever owned them
must have been in pretty bad shape.

01:37:22.921 --> 01:37:25.005
He wore false teeth.

01:37:26.007 --> 01:37:28.092
And eyeglasses.

01:37:28.843 --> 01:37:31.303
He had a failing heart.

01:37:32.055 --> 01:37:36.850
Towards the end, he... had
this prefabricated valve put in it.

01:37:38.937 --> 01:37:41.313
I don't say he was a man
like I knew at home,

01:37:41.439 --> 01:37:45.317
but he must have been a close relative.
He had all the same weaknesses.

01:37:46.486 --> 01:37:48.529
He was a weak,

01:37:48.655 --> 01:37:50.697
fragile animal.

01:37:50.824 --> 01:37:52.908
But he was here before you

01:37:52.992 --> 01:37:55.077
and he was better than you are.

01:37:55.161 --> 01:38:00.999
That's lunacy! I can offer alternate
descriptions of every one of those articles

01:38:01.084 --> 01:38:04.044
which is just as ingenious as yours.

01:38:04.129 --> 01:38:07.005
But it'd be conjecture, not proof.

01:38:07.090 --> 01:38:18.058
Mamma!

01:38:20.353 --> 01:38:24.523
Dr. Zaius, would an ape make a human doll

01:38:24.607 --> 01:38:26.150
that talks?

01:38:30.864 --> 01:38:31.989
Lucius!

01:38:34.576 --> 01:38:36.660
You dirty...

01:38:36.744 --> 01:38:59.641
Nova!

01:39:37.347 --> 01:39:39.181
Cornelius!

01:39:39.265 --> 01:39:41.141
Zira!

01:39:41.226 --> 01:39:43.268
Help me!

01:39:45.396 --> 01:39:47.439
Mamma!

01:39:54.030 --> 01:39:56.114
I oughta kill you right now.

01:39:56.199 --> 01:39:57.616
Come on!

01:39:59.035 --> 01:40:01.119
Tell 'em to pull back. Now!

01:40:01.204 --> 01:40:03.664
Cease fire! Withdraw!

01:40:05.833 --> 01:40:07.209
Up there!

01:40:07.293 --> 01:40:09.378
Withdraw!

01:40:11.506 --> 01:40:13.632
Get down!

01:40:27.063 --> 01:40:29.147
Lucius, are you all right?

01:40:29.232 --> 01:40:31.483
They took me by surprise.

01:40:31.609 --> 01:40:35.153
Sneaked up on me
while I was feeding the horses.

01:40:35.238 --> 01:40:37.322
What's happened to honor?

01:40:38.658 --> 01:40:40.742
I got off two rounds to warn you.

01:40:40.827 --> 01:40:44.580
- They've taken everything.
- Not quite everything!

01:40:44.664 --> 01:40:47.666
They left a hostage behind.

01:40:47.750 --> 01:40:50.502
- How are you feeling?
- Disillusioned.

01:40:50.628 --> 01:40:53.130
You can't trust the older generation.

01:40:53.214 --> 01:40:55.465
I know what you mean.

01:40:55.550 --> 01:40:59.803
I want you to go round the rocks and tell
those gorillas I've got Dr. Zaius prisoner.

01:40:59.887 --> 01:41:02.055
Yes, I can do that.

01:41:02.140 --> 01:41:06.435
I want a horse, food, and water.
Enough for a week for me and this female.

01:41:06.519 --> 01:41:10.606
- And 50 rounds of ammunition.
- What if they won't agree to your terms?

01:41:10.690 --> 01:41:12.733
Tell them I'll shoot him.

01:41:12.859 --> 01:41:14.901
Taylor, you can't!

01:41:14.986 --> 01:41:17.112
Oh, yes, he can.

01:41:17.739 --> 01:41:19.906
He's a born killer.

01:41:19.991 --> 01:41:22.117
Deliver the message.

01:41:23.745 --> 01:41:25.871
Over here.

01:41:29.292 --> 01:41:31.543
Sit down.

01:41:47.602 --> 01:41:51.647
Taylor, please! Don't treat him like that!

01:41:51.731 --> 01:41:54.399
- Why not?
- It's humiliating.

01:41:55.735 --> 01:41:59.279
The way I was humiliated... by all of you?

01:41:59.364 --> 01:42:01.406
You led me around on a leash!

01:42:01.532 --> 01:42:04.534
That was different.
We thought you were inferior.

01:42:04.619 --> 01:42:06.787
Now you know better.

01:42:06.913 --> 01:42:09.665
Cornelius was right, doctor. He proved it.

01:42:09.749 --> 01:42:13.502
Man was here first. You owe him
your science, your culture,

01:42:13.586 --> 01:42:17.547
- whatever civilization you've got.
- Then answer me this.

01:42:17.632 --> 01:42:21.301
If man was superior,
why didn't he survive?

01:42:21.386 --> 01:42:25.847
Wiped out by a plague, some natural
catastrophe, a storm of meteors.

01:42:25.932 --> 01:42:29.267
From the looks of some parts
of this planet, I'd say that was a fair bet.

01:42:29.352 --> 01:42:30.977
But we can't be sure.

01:42:31.062 --> 01:42:32.813
He is.

01:42:32.939 --> 01:42:37.275
He knew all the time.
Long before you found your cave, he knew.

01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:40.987
Defender of the faith?
Guardian of the terrible secret.

01:42:41.072 --> 01:42:43.407
- That's it, isn't it, doctor?
- What I know of man

01:42:43.491 --> 01:42:45.575
was written long ago.

01:42:45.660 --> 01:42:49.246
Set down by the greatest ape of all,
our lawgiver.

01:42:49.330 --> 01:42:50.455
Cornelius,

01:42:50.581 --> 01:42:52.624
come here.

01:42:52.750 --> 01:42:55.752
Reach into my pocket. Read to him

01:42:55.837 --> 01:42:57.921
the 29th scroll.

01:42:58.005 --> 01:42:59.423
6th verse.

01:43:03.261 --> 01:43:07.347
"Beware the beast man,
for he is the devil's pawn."

01:43:07.432 --> 01:43:10.016
"Alone among God's primates,

01:43:10.101 --> 01:43:14.354
he kills for sport or lust or greed."

01:43:15.314 --> 01:43:19.484
"Yea, he will murder his brother
to possess his brother's land."

01:43:19.610 --> 01:43:22.487
"Let him not breed in great numbers,

01:43:22.572 --> 01:43:26.908
for he will make a desert
of his home and yours."

01:43:26.993 --> 01:43:29.077
"Shun him."

01:43:29.203 --> 01:43:31.747
"Drive him back into his jungle lair."

01:43:31.831 --> 01:43:35.125
"For he is the harbinger of death."

01:43:37.086 --> 01:43:40.589
I found nothing in the cave
to alter that conception of man

01:43:40.673 --> 01:43:42.674
and I still live by its injunction.

01:43:51.517 --> 01:43:53.602
That's far enough!

01:44:00.693 --> 01:44:03.278
They think you're behaving foolishly.

01:44:03.946 --> 01:44:06.031
I must say, I agree!

01:44:06.115 --> 01:44:08.241
Where will you go?

01:44:08.326 --> 01:44:11.703
To start with, I'll follow
the shoreline and my nose.

01:44:11.829 --> 01:44:15.081
But suppose you find nothing
but... but wasteland?

01:44:15.166 --> 01:44:17.292
How will you survive?

01:44:17.376 --> 01:44:18.960
He won't survive.

01:44:23.925 --> 01:44:26.051
Nova.

01:44:28.888 --> 01:44:30.931
How about coming along?

01:44:31.057 --> 01:44:34.267
- We can't.
- It's better than going to jail for heresy.

01:44:34.352 --> 01:44:36.561
Oh, they can't convict us of heresy.

01:44:36.687 --> 01:44:38.980
You've helped prove our innocence.

01:44:39.065 --> 01:44:41.566
Besides... his culture

01:44:41.651 --> 01:44:43.944
is our culture.

01:44:44.070 --> 01:44:46.780
Well, good luck, then.

01:44:52.995 --> 01:44:55.205
Lucius.

01:44:55.331 --> 01:44:57.666
I still say you're making a mistake.

01:44:57.750 --> 01:45:00.043
That's the spirit. Keep 'em flying.

01:45:00.127 --> 01:45:02.921
- What?
- The flags of discontent.

01:45:03.005 --> 01:45:05.924
Remember, never trust anybody over 30.

01:45:06.008 --> 01:45:09.135
Doctor, I'd like to kiss you goodbye.

01:45:16.769 --> 01:45:18.812
All right, but

01:45:18.938 --> 01:45:20.981
you're so damned ugly.

01:45:46.757 --> 01:45:50.051
Don't try to follow us.
I'm pretty handy with this.

01:45:50.136 --> 01:45:52.220
Of that I'm sure.

01:45:52.305 --> 01:45:57.642
All my life I've awaited your coming
and dreaded it, like death itself.

01:45:57.768 --> 01:45:58.768
Why?

01:45:58.853 --> 01:46:02.939
I've terrified you from the first, doctor.
I still do.

01:46:03.024 --> 01:46:05.817
You're afraid of me and you hate me. Why?

01:46:05.943 --> 01:46:08.153
Because you're a man.

01:46:08.237 --> 01:46:10.322
And you're right.

01:46:10.448 --> 01:46:12.949
I have always known about man.

01:46:13.826 --> 01:46:20.040
From the evidence, I believe his wisdom
must walk hand in hand with his idiocy.

01:46:20.166 --> 01:46:22.542
His emotions must rule his brain.

01:46:22.627 --> 01:46:25.754
He must be a warlike creature
who gives battle

01:46:25.838 --> 01:46:28.673
to everything around him, even himself.

01:46:28.758 --> 01:46:32.052
What evidence?
There were no weapons in that cave.

01:46:32.178 --> 01:46:35.430
The forbidden zone was once a paradise.

01:46:35.514 --> 01:46:39.809
Your breed made a desert of it... ages ago.

01:46:39.894 --> 01:46:42.103
It still doesn't give me the why.

01:46:42.188 --> 01:46:44.856
A planet where apes evolved from men.

01:46:46.359 --> 01:46:48.485
There's gotta be an answer.

01:46:48.569 --> 01:46:50.654
Don't look for it, Taylor.

01:46:51.489 --> 01:46:53.865
You may not like what you find.

01:47:02.208 --> 01:47:04.292
Untie me!

01:47:18.057 --> 01:47:20.100
No, no, no! Wait!

01:47:20.226 --> 01:47:22.268
Wait!

01:47:22.353 --> 01:47:24.479
Let him go!

01:47:25.898 --> 01:47:30.276
Lieutenant, fetch your explosives.
We're going to seal up the cave.

01:47:30.361 --> 01:47:31.653
Yes, sir!

01:47:31.737 --> 01:47:33.905
- Seal the cave?
- That is correct.

01:47:34.031 --> 01:47:36.658
And you will both stand trial for heresy.

01:47:36.742 --> 01:47:40.829
- But the proof! The doll!
- In a few minutes there will be no doll.

01:47:40.913 --> 01:47:42.998
There can't be. I'm sorry.

01:47:43.082 --> 01:47:44.541
Dr. Zaius!

01:47:44.625 --> 01:47:47.002
Dr. Zaius, you mustn't! You promised!

01:47:47.086 --> 01:47:49.170
What I do, I do with no pleasure.

01:47:49.255 --> 01:47:51.506
- Silence him!
- Doctor.

01:47:51.590 --> 01:47:54.509
Dr. Zaius, this is inexcusable!

01:47:55.136 --> 01:47:57.637
Why must knowledge stand still?

01:47:57.722 --> 01:47:59.764
What about the future?

01:48:00.975 --> 01:48:03.101
I may just have saved it for you.

01:48:06.272 --> 01:48:08.606
What will he find out there, doctor?

01:48:09.942 --> 01:48:12.277
His destiny.

01:50:22.616 --> 01:50:24.742
Oh, my God!

01:50:25.578 --> 01:50:27.704
I'm back!

01:50:28.873 --> 01:50:31.207
I'm home.

01:50:31.292 --> 01:50:33.585
All the time, it was...

01:50:35.713 --> 01:50:37.797
We finally really did it.

01:50:38.924 --> 01:50:41.009
You maniacs!

01:50:42.428 --> 01:50:44.721
You blew it up!

01:50:44.805 --> 01:50:46.890
God damn you!

01:50:47.892 --> 01:50:52.729
God damn you all to hell!
