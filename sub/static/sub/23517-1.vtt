01:10.821 --> 01:12.739
All right. Let's go.

01:13.824 --> 01:14.825
Doug.

01:15.784 --> 01:16.827
Come on.

01:19.621 --> 01:20.622
Doug.

01:20.706 --> 01:23.000
He can stay in the car for all I care.

01:24.793 --> 01:26.086
<i>You really want to start there?</i>

01:26.169 --> 01:28.630
Nobody cares about my fucked up family.

01:28.714 --> 01:30.674
- Everybody has a fucked up family.
- Okay, but...

01:30.757 --> 01:32.426
There's got to be a better way
to start a movie.

01:32.509 --> 01:34.094
Could you just introduce yourself?

01:34.177 --> 01:37.597
My name is Doug Kenney,
and you probably have never heard of me.

01:37.681 --> 01:38.724
Maybe say something like,

01:38.807 --> 01:41.018
"I'm the creative force
that redefined comedy."

01:41.101 --> 01:43.270
No, that's blowing smoke up my own ass.

01:43.353 --> 01:44.438
I can't do that.

01:44.521 --> 01:47.024
I would say you did redefine comedy
for a generation.

01:47.107 --> 01:48.525
I redefined comedy. Okay.

01:48.609 --> 01:50.611
<i>Yeah, I started The National Lampoon.</i>

01:50.694 --> 01:53.614
<i>I did Animal House.
I did Caddyshack, and I...</i>

01:54.031 --> 01:55.324
Well, that's the main stuff.

01:55.407 --> 01:58.118
What if you say, "I was the man
who changed comedy forever,

01:58.201 --> 02:00.370
but I couldn't change myself."

02:00.454 --> 02:02.581
Really? Blow me.

02:02.664 --> 02:05.709
I was the man
who changed comedy forever...

02:06.543 --> 02:08.419
but I couldn't change myself.

02:08.502 --> 02:10.756
- I liked that. That was great.
- Oh, fuck.

02:10.839 --> 02:14.509
- We can start at whatever point you want.
- Let's start this film at Harvard

02:14.593 --> 02:16.261
'cause that's where the fun stuff was.

02:16.345 --> 02:18.263
Okay. Perfect. We're rolling, so go ahead.

02:18.347 --> 02:20.474
Oh, okay.

02:21.058 --> 02:25.312
<i>It was the fall of 1964
when I first met Henry Beard.</i>

02:25.812 --> 02:29.232
<i>Henry was from the right kind of family
on the Upper East Side.</i>

02:29.650 --> 02:31.526
<i>He belonged at a place like Harvard.</i>

02:32.027 --> 02:34.780
<i>I was a middle class Midwestern dork.</i>

02:34.863 --> 02:37.741
<i>I got in, but it took a while to fit in.</i>

02:39.368 --> 02:40.786
Doug Kenney, Chagrin Falls.

02:42.120 --> 02:43.372
Jesus Christ, not that one.

02:43.455 --> 02:44.331
Ah.

02:44.414 --> 02:47.250
- My name tag is a picture of a penis.
- Hmm.

02:49.378 --> 02:51.671
What's up
with the Barry Goldwater fan club?

02:51.755 --> 02:54.883
They're double majoring
in white collar crime and applied hubris.

02:55.300 --> 02:56.176
Oh.

02:57.719 --> 02:58.970
Fuck those guys.

03:06.269 --> 03:07.312
Doug!

03:07.396 --> 03:10.065
The crowd at Wimbledon gasps.
He charges the net.

03:13.610 --> 03:15.237
<i>Fucking Lampoon.</i>

03:15.862 --> 03:19.157
<i>Turns out Henry and I weren't
the only troublemakers at Harvard.</i>

03:19.241 --> 03:21.785
<i>We found the rest of them
at the campus publication</i>

03:21.868 --> 03:26.456
<i>that had been around for a century,
run out of this strange little castle.</i>

03:26.540 --> 03:29.376
This is The Harvard Lampoon,
the only place on campus

03:29.459 --> 03:32.712
that a goofy kid from Chagrin Falls
can feel like a king.

03:33.463 --> 03:36.758
It's a humor magazine,
but mostly an excuse to party.

03:37.926 --> 03:41.847
<i>It's where I learned that being funny
is how I could fit in and meet girls.</i>

03:41.930 --> 03:45.392
<i>In fact, I met my wife there.
We'll get back to her in a minute.</i>

03:45.475 --> 03:48.311
<i>The person
who really mattered the most was Henry,</i>

03:48.395 --> 03:50.814
<i>the oldest guy who was ever a teenager.</i>

03:51.189 --> 03:52.399
- Your shot.
- Hmm.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.069
Tough spot.

03:56.153 --> 03:57.404
What most people don't realize

03:57.487 --> 04:00.949
is that sidespin has
no appreciable effect on the tangent line

04:01.032 --> 04:03.660
unless the cue ball
has sufficient forward roll.

04:08.999 --> 04:09.875
Impressive.

04:09.958 --> 04:12.794
But can you do this?

04:16.089 --> 04:18.800
- Exceptional lift.
- It's all in the wrist.

04:18.884 --> 04:20.218
Hmm.

04:20.343 --> 04:21.511
Oh, Henry.

04:23.430 --> 04:25.474
- I think I should, uh...
- I think you should...

04:27.058 --> 04:28.977
Peter, you look gorgeous.

04:29.060 --> 04:30.979
- Lucy, you'll fill out some day.
- Thanks.

04:31.062 --> 04:33.648
- And who is this?
- This is Alex. She's a friend of ours.

04:33.732 --> 04:34.691
We take Psych together.

04:34.775 --> 04:36.568
Doug Kenney, Chagrin Falls, Ohio.

04:36.651 --> 04:37.986
Alex Garcia-Mata.

04:38.320 --> 04:41.156
A lot of vowels. You know, they are
the most sensual of letters.

04:41.239 --> 04:42.073
I did not know that.

04:42.157 --> 04:45.744
So, this is the super-secret castle
I've heard so much about?

04:45.827 --> 04:47.621
Would you like to see the dungeon?

04:47.704 --> 04:49.664
How scared should I be?

04:49.748 --> 04:51.583
- Don't worry, you'll be fine.
- Reasonably.

04:55.712 --> 04:58.298
"Does sex sell magazines?" Huh.

04:58.381 --> 05:00.634
The answer, by the way, is yes.

05:00.717 --> 05:02.719
That's how we afford
the finer things here.

05:02.803 --> 05:03.845
Spree-tay?

05:04.346 --> 05:06.348
You don't have to try so hard
to impress me.

05:06.431 --> 05:07.390
Oh.

05:07.474 --> 05:10.060
If I was trying to impress you,
I would just do this.

05:10.936 --> 05:13.730
Oh, my God. That is horrible.

05:13.814 --> 05:16.191
I learned that from my mom.
It's a true story.

05:16.274 --> 05:17.859
- Wow.
- You guys should meet.

05:17.943 --> 05:20.320
- Yeah, maybe sometime.
- I would like that.

05:20.987 --> 05:22.989
You're not really a preppy, are you?

05:23.740 --> 05:25.408
You're not a hippie, either.

05:25.492 --> 05:26.660
Well, I'm both.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.787
- I'm a prippy.
- Mmm.

05:29.704 --> 05:32.499
I think what you are is a kid
from Chagrin Falls, Ohio,

05:32.582 --> 05:34.918
who borrowed his roommate's tuxedo

05:35.001 --> 05:37.420
to look like he grew up
on the Upper East Side.

05:37.504 --> 05:39.673
You do? Well, that is...

05:40.257 --> 05:42.551
exactly right. Yeah.

05:42.634 --> 05:44.469
No, you nailed it, in fact.

05:44.553 --> 05:45.929
Well, you wear it well.

05:53.353 --> 05:57.566
I hate to interrupt your mating ritual,
but we're about to be adulated upstairs.

05:57.941 --> 06:01.236
- And I know how you feel about adulation.
- Oh, remind me how I feel?

06:01.319 --> 06:03.238
- You like it.
- Oh, I love adulation.

06:03.321 --> 06:04.948
- You love it.
- We should go upstairs then.

06:06.408 --> 06:09.160
We call this
the William Randolph Hearst staircase.

06:09.244 --> 06:11.288
- It's named after John Updike.
- Here they are!

06:11.913 --> 06:13.623
Super-sirs, special guests.

06:13.707 --> 06:17.252
As you know, the parodies that Doug
and Henry have been churning out

06:17.335 --> 06:20.213
have paid for everything
you drunks are enjoying here tonight.

06:21.590 --> 06:26.011
So it is my honor to unveil their latest,

06:26.094 --> 06:28.305
with apologies to JRR Tolkien,

06:28.388 --> 06:30.098
hot off the presses,

06:30.181 --> 06:33.101
<i>Bored of the Rings!</i>

06:33.184 --> 06:35.937
- They wrote a book?
- And all of their term papers.

06:36.021 --> 06:37.063
And some of mine.

06:37.147 --> 06:40.275
So, I'm guessing like a speech
would be in order at this point.

06:40.358 --> 06:43.528
- Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech!
- That's enough. That's enough.

06:43.612 --> 06:45.739
Little bit more than that though
because I get...

06:47.490 --> 06:49.743
Yeah, that's enough. That's enough. Okay.

06:49.826 --> 06:54.456
<i>What is it about filling 200 pages
with atrocious Lord of the Rings puns</i>

06:54.539 --> 06:57.709
that feels so right and yet Saur-on?

06:59.336 --> 07:01.504
I'm sorry, once I start punning
about these little guys,

07:01.588 --> 07:03.632
it's tough to kick the hobbit.

07:04.924 --> 07:08.136
That was bad,
but we only have our elves to blame.

07:08.219 --> 07:11.681
Okay. Okay, always leave them
wanting more... dor.

07:13.308 --> 07:14.726
Pretty good. It was pretty good.

07:14.809 --> 07:16.269
Or fantastic.

07:27.989 --> 07:30.200
That's what I call a book party.

07:30.283 --> 07:32.953
Things get crazy
when the jackets come off.

07:33.036 --> 07:34.329
Hmm?

07:34.412 --> 07:36.289
Jackets. Book jackets?

07:37.666 --> 07:40.543
That's the kind of joke that would
slay 'em at the legion hall back home.

07:41.795 --> 07:44.714
- That's what you call a book party.
- That's what I call a book party.

07:44.798 --> 07:48.093
<i>- If the book is How to Ruin a Castle.
- No, it's not.</i>

07:50.971 --> 07:53.431
We had a fine run here, you and I.

07:55.517 --> 07:56.351
You got in.

07:56.434 --> 07:58.478
Columbia? Georgetown?

07:58.561 --> 08:00.355
Both. All of them.

08:01.064 --> 08:03.483
I guess law school's
not that hard to get into.

08:03.566 --> 08:06.444
Yeah. I'm almost done
with my applications, too.

08:06.528 --> 08:09.239
Just need to find a pen, paper.

08:09.656 --> 08:13.410
So I guess the comedy train
is rolling to a halt.

08:14.786 --> 08:16.413
I'm gonna miss this place.

08:16.871 --> 08:18.415
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

08:18.790 --> 08:20.709
<i>I said I just need to find a pen, Mom.</i>

08:20.792 --> 08:24.421
Doug, this is serious.
You didn't apply anywhere?

08:24.504 --> 08:25.880
For the love of Christ.

08:25.964 --> 08:28.842
- I've been busy. I did write a book.
- Most of a book.

08:28.925 --> 08:31.845
Well, Henry helped... with the spelling.
Uh, did you like it?

08:31.928 --> 08:35.472
- She didn't read it.
- The book? Yes, it's very nice.

08:35.557 --> 08:37.142
Um...

08:38.809 --> 08:40.061
Interesting cover.

08:40.145 --> 08:41.187
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

08:41.270 --> 08:42.772
- Loves the cover.
- How is Henry?

08:42.856 --> 08:44.941
<i>- He's going to law school, that's how.
- Henry's okay.</i>

08:45.025 --> 08:48.278
We were supposed to hang out today,
but he got arrested. Arson again.

08:48.361 --> 08:49.195
It's the gentleman's crime.

08:49.279 --> 08:50.613
<i>- What?
- I have to bail him out.</i>

08:50.697 --> 08:52.782
<i>- Doug, is that a joke?
- Doug, is that a joke?</i>

08:52.866 --> 08:54.325
Here, give me this. Give me this.

08:55.243 --> 08:56.244
<i>- Doug.
- Hey, Dad.</i>

08:56.327 --> 08:57.954
- What'd you think of the book?
- He didn't read it.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.247
It's very nice. Listen.

08:59.330 --> 09:01.541
<i>You got a month till graduation,
and we're still waiting to hear.</i>

09:01.624 --> 09:03.543
Do you have any kind of plan?

09:03.626 --> 09:06.337
I mean, we spent a lot of money
to get what? An English degree?

09:06.421 --> 09:07.839
Harvard education
and you throw it all away.

09:07.922 --> 09:10.341
<i>What's your plan, Doug?</i>

09:10.425 --> 09:12.135
We can't take care of you anymore.

09:12.510 --> 09:15.221
<i>There's a war going on. You want
to wait to get picked in the draft?</i>

09:15.305 --> 09:17.807
Or do you want to graduate Harvard
and then move back home,

09:17.891 --> 09:19.267
teach tennis with me at the club?

09:19.350 --> 09:22.228
If I teach, do I have to wear shorts?
'Cause that's a deal-breaker.

09:22.312 --> 09:23.146
<i>What do you want?</i>

09:23.229 --> 09:25.523
You want to write your little joke books
your whole life?

09:26.733 --> 09:29.194
<i>- Hello, Doug?
- I'll just keep doing The Lampoon.</i>

09:29.819 --> 09:31.446
<i>- What?
- What?</i>

09:31.529 --> 09:33.073
If you think I'm gonna pay
for another year of college...

09:33.156 --> 09:35.325
No, no, no.
I'm gonna start a real magazine.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.160
A national one, with Henry.

09:37.243 --> 09:39.287
- I'm not doing that.
- I don't have all the details,

09:39.370 --> 09:41.623
but Henry does have a few questions
about his backhand.

09:41.706 --> 09:43.875
<i>Come on. He needs help with the topspin.</i>

09:44.542 --> 09:46.753
<i>- Yes, Mr. Kenney, hello.
- Yeah, hi, Henry.</i>

09:46.836 --> 09:50.256
<i>- Well, I usually play on clay, you see.
- Yeah, on a hard court, you...</i>

09:51.091 --> 09:52.300
Strike one.

09:52.383 --> 09:54.427
You want me to put off law school
for some half-assed scheme?

09:54.511 --> 09:58.139
Oh, this scheme is full-assed.
Why settle for real jobs?

09:58.223 --> 10:00.517
You know, just wind up
behind a desk somewhere?

10:00.600 --> 10:02.227
You know, a magazine needs desks.

10:02.310 --> 10:06.564
The world doesn't need more lawyers
or insurance executives or doctors.

10:06.648 --> 10:11.152
I mean, yeah, okay, it needs doctors.
Thousands. But it also needs us.

10:11.236 --> 10:12.821
Strike two.

10:12.904 --> 10:16.658
Seriously? You assholes are gonna have
kids play for you the whole game?

10:16.741 --> 10:18.326
A magazine's a tough business, Doug.

10:18.409 --> 10:20.578
You want to be a writer,
write a novel on the side,

10:20.662 --> 10:22.789
something your parents can show off
on their credenza.

10:22.872 --> 10:25.291
I don't need to impress
my parents or their credenza.

10:25.375 --> 10:27.836
Strike three!

10:28.294 --> 10:29.546
The kid's got an arm.

10:30.004 --> 10:31.214
Nice job, guys.

10:32.090 --> 10:34.300
I have things I want to do with my life.

10:34.384 --> 10:36.970
No, you have things
you think you're supposed to do.

10:37.053 --> 10:39.764
<i>What you want to do
is keep on doing The Lampoon.</i>

10:39.848 --> 10:41.808
<i>- Oh, Biomechanics of the Human Bladder.
- Thanks.</i>

10:41.891 --> 10:43.434
I've been looking everywhere for that.

10:44.310 --> 10:47.814
You want me to give up a career
in law to rely on you

10:47.897 --> 10:50.775
and start a humor magazine
which will undoubtedly fail.

10:50.859 --> 10:53.570
It won't. Or it might. It might.

10:53.653 --> 10:56.823
- But this will be big. I can feel it.
- How big?

10:56.906 --> 10:57.949
This big.

10:58.032 --> 11:00.743
You're thinking too small.
It should be a big magazine size.

11:00.827 --> 11:03.746
See? That's better.
I threw something out, you made it better.

11:03.830 --> 11:06.374
That's our partnership.
You don't want to throw that away.

11:06.749 --> 11:09.878
If we're running our own magazine,
we can do anything we want.

11:09.961 --> 11:12.172
- We could publish knock-knock jokes.
- Knock knock.

11:12.255 --> 11:13.298
- Who's there?
- Me.

11:13.381 --> 11:14.757
- Me who?
- Me not doing the magazine.

11:15.592 --> 11:17.719
- That can go in issue one.
- Let me ask you this:

11:17.802 --> 11:20.680
<i>with The Harvard Lampoon,
how many deadlines have we missed?</i>

11:21.264 --> 11:22.181
- None.
- All of them.

11:22.265 --> 11:23.933
- All of them?
- We've never made a deadline.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.852
You really don't think you can rely on me?

11:25.935 --> 11:27.437
- No.
- I challenge you,

11:27.520 --> 11:29.188
name a thousand times I let you down.

11:29.731 --> 11:31.983
- Number one...
- Okay, that's not the point.

11:32.066 --> 11:35.153
Look, I know it's risky, okay,
but why let it end here?

11:35.236 --> 11:38.323
The truth is
I can't do this without you, man.

11:38.406 --> 11:41.159
- Half the time I feel like a fraud.
- And the other half?

11:41.242 --> 11:44.037
The other half, I feel like
the second-smartest guy in the room.

11:45.455 --> 11:46.414
I'm the smartest?

11:46.497 --> 11:47.540
Yeah.

11:48.291 --> 11:50.543
I promise you, it'll be fun.

11:51.044 --> 11:54.464
And the day that it stops being fun,
we'll walk away.

11:58.927 --> 12:00.053
Tempting.

12:00.136 --> 12:01.971
Tempting. Yes!

12:19.030 --> 12:22.075
<i>I looked at your proposal
for Harvard Lampoon.</i>

12:22.158 --> 12:23.534
<i>National Lampoon.</i>

12:23.618 --> 12:25.620
<i>We would license the Lampoon name
from Harvard.</i>

12:25.703 --> 12:28.581
As we say in the proposal,
there is a huge underserved audience

12:28.665 --> 12:30.416
for comedy that speaks to our generation.

12:30.500 --> 12:34.462
Oh, and you think that's what
this country needs is a comedy magazine.

12:34.545 --> 12:37.048
Kids need something to read
while getting tear-gassed.

12:38.216 --> 12:39.050
Ha.

12:39.133 --> 12:42.053
Shouldn't Harvard boys like you
be working on Wall Street

12:42.136 --> 12:44.639
or at some law firm that overcharges me?

12:44.722 --> 12:46.641
What do you want to do with your life?

12:46.724 --> 12:49.811
<i>There's a vast gap between Mad magazine
and the New Yorker...</i>

12:49.894 --> 12:51.270
I'm gonna stop you right here.

12:51.396 --> 12:53.189
- Okay.
- I don't want to waste your time.

12:53.272 --> 12:56.109
- I don't want to waste your time.
- We don't want to waste your time.

12:56.192 --> 12:59.445
<i>We publish Life, Fortune,
Sports Illustrated.</i>

12:59.529 --> 13:00.446
Right.

13:00.530 --> 13:02.073
Magazines about what people
are interested in.

13:02.156 --> 13:03.700
There's no business here.

13:03.783 --> 13:06.953
You'll never sell a magazine.
No one will ever go to a newsstand.

13:07.036 --> 13:08.204
I... I disagree.

13:08.287 --> 13:11.791
<i>Our Time parody, right there,
sold over half a million copies.</i>

13:11.874 --> 13:14.752
<i>- Bored of the Rings sold even more...
- They don't want to waste our time.</i>

13:14.836 --> 13:17.505
<i>Obviously, this Lampoon thing
is not gonna fly here.</i>

13:18.297 --> 13:21.426
So, let's talk about our other idea, huh?

13:23.803 --> 13:26.139
Huh? You want to go first or should I?

13:26.222 --> 13:27.724
- You should take it.
- Okay.

13:28.891 --> 13:30.059
Sandwiches.

13:30.643 --> 13:33.479
<i>- I'm sorry?
- Modern Sandwich.</i>

13:33.563 --> 13:38.192
A monthly magazine devoted to sandwiches
and the sandwich lifestyle.

13:38.276 --> 13:39.569
Henry's idea.

13:40.862 --> 13:44.032
Hey, we are a country divided
in so many ways:

13:44.115 --> 13:47.326
politically, economically, geographically.

13:47.410 --> 13:50.455
But two slices of bread,
some meat, a condiment or two?

13:50.538 --> 13:52.206
That's something we can all agree on.
Right, Jim?

13:52.290 --> 13:54.417
- I'm Frank.
- Let's all be frank.

13:54.500 --> 14:00.089
There is a huge under-served audience
for investigative sandwich journalism.

14:00.506 --> 14:03.468
I... You know, why is it so hard
to find a good tomato?

14:03.551 --> 14:06.095
Are club sandwiches too exclusive?

14:06.179 --> 14:07.180
<i>Modern Sandwich!</i>

14:07.764 --> 14:10.475
We'll run short fiction
and shorter recipes.

14:10.558 --> 14:13.644
Show pictures of pickles
and things that look like pickles,

14:13.728 --> 14:15.480
because Jim, other Jim,

14:15.563 --> 14:17.815
- let's open-face it...
- I don't see the point of this.

14:17.899 --> 14:21.110
The point is,
you don't have a fucking clue.

14:21.903 --> 14:25.990
You're the kind of people who commute back
and forth from Westport, Connecticut.

14:26.074 --> 14:29.619
And we have nothing to do with you.
Fucking pieces of shit.

14:33.456 --> 14:34.832
You have our information.

14:37.668 --> 14:38.795
Oh.

14:40.254 --> 14:41.464
I'm gonna take it.

14:43.674 --> 14:45.802
That one, I would say,
was less promising.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.512
Maybe we need to rethink our pitch.

14:47.595 --> 14:50.431
Fuck those guys, you know?
They're just like my dad.

14:50.515 --> 14:53.643
They jerk off to Eisenhower biographies.

14:53.726 --> 14:56.479
Yes, but,
and this is what I love about them,

14:56.562 --> 14:57.605
they have money.

14:57.688 --> 15:02.276
So can we please just pretend for a second
that they and we are on the same side

15:02.360 --> 15:03.945
until after the check clears.

15:05.363 --> 15:07.490
Fine, who's next?

15:07.698 --> 15:09.409
Hmm. Last stop.

15:12.412 --> 15:13.913
We've come to you first

15:13.996 --> 15:17.125
because we are so impressed
by what you've built with your magazine.

15:17.208 --> 15:18.709
Yogurt instead of sour cream.

15:18.793 --> 15:20.670
So simple, yet so brilliant.

15:20.753 --> 15:23.631
You know, they said a Weight Watcher's
magazine would never work.

15:23.714 --> 15:26.592
Now we're moving 500,000 copies a month.

15:27.051 --> 15:28.261
God bless the fatties.

15:28.344 --> 15:29.470
- God bless 'em.
- Yes.

15:29.554 --> 15:32.390
- Listen, I don't want to waste your time.
- Here we go.

15:32.473 --> 15:36.185
Most magazines fail within the first year.
And a laugh rag?

15:36.769 --> 15:38.312
Even Hefner couldn't make that work.

15:38.396 --> 15:40.898
Okay. Look, Mr. Simmons. Matty.

15:40.982 --> 15:43.901
The truth is, we've already got
some offers from the big publishers.

15:43.985 --> 15:46.821
- Your friend just said I was the first...
- No, I was...

15:46.904 --> 15:50.533
<i>But you're our choice
to publish a National Lampoon.</i>

15:50.616 --> 15:51.576
- Yeah.
- Yes.

15:51.659 --> 15:53.661
The big publishers,
they don't get the youth market.

15:53.744 --> 15:55.204
And we checked around, they said,

15:55.288 --> 15:59.292
"Hey, you want funny, you go
to Matty Simmons because he gets funny."

15:59.917 --> 16:01.043
They said that?

16:01.127 --> 16:02.753
Every single one.

16:03.254 --> 16:06.424
You know, I used to write one-liners
for Walter Winchell.

16:06.757 --> 16:08.801
<i>We wuv Winchell.</i>

16:08.885 --> 16:10.720
- Hmm.
- Yeah. Hey.

16:15.308 --> 16:18.144
<i>We were in business,
with contracts and everything,</i>

16:18.227 --> 16:19.479
<i>like real grown-ups.</i>

16:20.104 --> 16:22.148
<i>And remember Alex from Harvard?</i>

16:22.231 --> 16:23.983
<i>Beautiful, out of my league?</i>

16:24.066 --> 16:26.402
<i>Well, we got married
and moved in together.</i>

16:26.486 --> 16:28.821
<i>I promised it'd be the two of us
against the world.</i>

16:28.905 --> 16:29.780
It's charming.

16:29.864 --> 16:32.450
It may not be
the palatial estate you grew up in.

16:32.533 --> 16:34.035
You know I don't care about that.

16:34.118 --> 16:37.371
There's no jockeys' quarters
or chocolate covered chandeliers...

16:37.455 --> 16:39.832
There's still no running water.
Toilet's a mess.

16:42.251 --> 16:43.753
What is Henry doing here?

16:43.836 --> 16:45.463
- He lives here.
- We live here.

16:45.546 --> 16:47.006
It's fun, right?

16:49.842 --> 16:52.261
Look, it's not ideal right now,

16:52.345 --> 16:54.597
but hopefully we'll build
the business up over time,

16:54.680 --> 16:58.392
and in five years, Matty has to buy
our share of the magazine, okay?

16:58.476 --> 17:00.728
And then we can each afford
our own apartment.

17:00.811 --> 17:03.940
And don't worry, Henry and I
will wave to you from across the park.

17:04.022 --> 17:05.525
Okay.

17:06.192 --> 17:07.276
Fine.

17:07.859 --> 17:10.738
But can the two of us
at least try to have fun now,

17:10.820 --> 17:12.698
not wait five years to be happy?

17:12.781 --> 17:17.619
Of course. First few months will be
crazy busy, but I'll pencil you in.

17:28.214 --> 17:32.093
Two pencils and a pad of paper.
That's all Matty said we could afford.

17:32.176 --> 17:34.929
Well, then. Please, I insist.

17:35.513 --> 17:37.348
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

17:37.431 --> 17:39.016
Hey, thank you.

17:39.100 --> 17:40.351
No, thank you.

17:40.434 --> 17:44.063
- No, I think I thanked you first and...
- Well, I think I'm a little more thankful.

17:44.146 --> 17:45.898
- But thank you.
- Okay, well...

17:45.982 --> 17:47.984
Did you do something new
with your hair today?

17:48.067 --> 17:50.903
Can you blame me?
We called her Mary Marshmallow

17:50.987 --> 17:52.613
because of her enormous breasts.

17:52.697 --> 17:54.073
They were like marshmallows.

17:55.533 --> 17:57.159
Hey, what are you up to later?

17:58.411 --> 18:02.039
What! So he's a charming stud,
and I'm a dirty old man? That's ageism!

18:04.083 --> 18:05.084
Hey, man.

18:08.004 --> 18:10.047
Those are the art directors you hired?

18:10.131 --> 18:12.216
They're cool. They know R. Crumb.

18:13.009 --> 18:15.386
So, day one.

18:16.262 --> 18:18.139
- Let's get started, huh?
- Yeah.

18:19.181 --> 18:21.017
Ideas for a magazine.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.019
Fill up a magazine
with words and sentences.

18:23.102 --> 18:26.814
- Humorous. Humorous magazine.
- Preferably funny. Preferably funny.

18:32.862 --> 18:34.447
I'm gonna write down "comedy."

18:34.989 --> 18:37.908
That's good. Let's build on that.

18:38.534 --> 18:40.369
I bet Chris and George have a few ideas.

18:40.703 --> 18:43.289
Maybe we should find some writers
who didn't go to Harvard.

18:44.248 --> 18:47.335
I'm sorry, I don't quite understand.
You mean like a Yalie?

18:47.627 --> 18:48.919
<i>Oh, they were out there.</i>

18:49.003 --> 18:50.796
<i>One of the first guys we brought on board</i>

18:50.880 --> 18:53.466
<i>wrote dirty comic strips
for underground papers</i>

18:53.549 --> 18:55.301
<i>and aspired to be the Antichrist.</i>

18:55.384 --> 18:58.304
I am going to send you
a canister of nerve gas

18:58.387 --> 19:01.390
that will explode upon opening,
you mongoloid twat!

19:03.476 --> 19:06.520
You sent me the wrong records.

19:07.271 --> 19:09.565
You're the Columbia Fucking Record Club!

19:15.029 --> 19:18.157
<i>We had a comedian from England
named Tony Hendra.</i>

19:18.240 --> 19:20.785
Mr. Sullivan would find jokes
about the Tet Offensive.

19:20.868 --> 19:22.495
- Don't you say it.
- Offensive?

19:23.120 --> 19:26.999
Do you know what I find offensive?
Being a traitor to one's generation.

19:27.667 --> 19:31.921
Know what? I am done sucking chuckles
from blue-haired septuagenarians.

19:32.004 --> 19:35.216
Tell Mr. Sullivan he can take
his bloody show and shove it.

19:36.967 --> 19:40.262
<i>Then there was a woman who managed
to crash our little boy's club.</i>

19:40.346 --> 19:43.307
<i>A refugee from the advertising world,
Anne Beatts.</i>

19:43.391 --> 19:46.268
Hey, baby! Why don't you bring
those jugs back around?

19:48.688 --> 19:52.149
<i>She was tough. She had to be
to deal with all our caveman bullshit.</i>

19:52.233 --> 19:53.776
Look at you.

19:53.859 --> 19:55.277
Where'd you get those pecs, butch?

19:55.361 --> 19:57.780
Come on, little juicy buns, huh?

19:57.863 --> 20:00.032
Mmm, mmm, mmm. Come on, spin around.

20:00.116 --> 20:03.369
- Let me see that ass. Show Mama that ass.
- What? No.

20:04.036 --> 20:06.038
Sorry, I was just trying to prove a point.

20:07.123 --> 20:09.542
To show there's no hard feelings,
let me give you a hand job.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.085
Whoa.

20:11.168 --> 20:12.002
Really?

20:17.133 --> 20:19.844
<i>Excuse me? Story idea, Amish in Space.</i>

20:20.803 --> 20:21.971
Hmm?

20:22.054 --> 20:23.889
<i>Secret Letters of the Alphabet.</i>

20:23.973 --> 20:25.391
I'll get the check.

20:25.975 --> 20:28.644
<i>Brian McConnachie.
Straight-up weirdo.</i>

20:29.186 --> 20:30.354
Brian made more sense

20:30.438 --> 20:34.442
once you understood that he came to us
from the planet Mogdar.

20:35.234 --> 20:38.028
We also had Sean Kelly, Rick Meyerowitz.

20:38.112 --> 20:39.989
So many great contributors.

20:40.072 --> 20:43.784
But four is all that really fit our story,
so I'm sorry, guys.

20:43.868 --> 20:45.119
Hmm.

20:45.202 --> 20:48.998
You know, maybe if one of you
had been black, we could've included you.

20:49.582 --> 20:52.460
So there were no funny black writers
in the '70s?

20:52.543 --> 20:54.295
And just one funny woman?

20:54.378 --> 20:58.466
Oh, I'm sure they were out there.
It's just that we didn't think to look.

20:58.549 --> 21:00.426
You know, it was a different time.

21:00.509 --> 21:01.469
- Hmm...
- Hmm...

21:01.552 --> 21:04.180
In our defense, we also had very few Jews.

21:04.263 --> 21:05.973
- Oh.
- Oh.

21:07.224 --> 21:09.685
Okay, everyone. Take a seat. Take a seat.

21:10.436 --> 21:11.687
Gather 'round.

21:11.771 --> 21:16.567
<i>Welcome, everyone,
to the National Lampoon.</i>

21:16.650 --> 21:17.943
I'm still working on that.

21:18.027 --> 21:20.696
Mm-hmm. We have eight weeks
to put out the first issue,

21:20.780 --> 21:22.698
and so far we have...

21:23.741 --> 21:24.950
nothing.

21:25.034 --> 21:27.995
So please remember
that there are no bad ideas.

21:28.412 --> 21:31.290
- Apart from ideas we don't like.
- Yeah, do not pitch those.

21:31.373 --> 21:33.042
- Yeah.
- I had a few thoughts.

21:35.586 --> 21:37.129
Were we all supposed
to bring those?

21:37.213 --> 21:38.923
- Yes.
- I left mine on the bus.

21:39.006 --> 21:41.217
"Hitler's device
for gassing Rube Goldberg."

21:41.592 --> 21:46.055
A Dr. Seuss story concerning
the sexual awakening of a young Toucan.

21:46.138 --> 21:47.890
<i>A Concrete Jungle Book,</i>

21:47.973 --> 21:52.520
a young white baby comes of age
above 125th Street.

21:52.603 --> 21:53.771
That's tempting.

21:53.854 --> 21:57.149
One of those baby books,
but for a war baby in Vietnam.

21:58.234 --> 22:00.027
<i>Baby's First Wound, that kind of thing.
Adorable.</i>

22:00.110 --> 22:02.863
<i>How about this?
The Joys of Wife-Tasting.</i>

22:02.947 --> 22:05.574
This wife has a fruity flavor,
exceptional finish.

22:05.658 --> 22:08.160
This wife had a vinegary bouquet.

22:09.119 --> 22:10.454
<i>Tarzan of the Cows.</i>

22:10.538 --> 22:12.581
<i>Nancy Reagan's Dating Dos and Don'ts.</i>

22:12.665 --> 22:15.042
<i>- You're a Good Man, Charlie Manson.
- Tempting.</i>

22:15.125 --> 22:18.045
"Upon seeing his condition, Ms. Braddock
said, 'Winston, you're drunk.'

22:18.462 --> 22:21.173
Mustering all his dignity,
Churchill cocked an eyebrow and rejoined,

22:21.257 --> 22:24.927
with that famous Churchill wit,
'Shove it up your ass, you ugly cunt.'"

22:26.971 --> 22:28.430
Yeah, really great, guys.

22:28.514 --> 22:30.558
- Matty, where you going?
- That's history.

22:30.641 --> 22:32.810
- Come on!
- Here's a cover idea.

22:32.893 --> 22:35.312
Nixon with a long wooden nose.

22:40.568 --> 22:42.570
You know, like Pinocchio.

22:44.780 --> 22:45.948
It's really hard-hitting.

22:46.031 --> 22:47.491
Boo!

22:48.784 --> 22:51.829
<i>You know, I hear The Village Voice
has very good benefits.</i>

22:51.912 --> 22:54.415
We talked about bad ideas.
We had a whole conversation...

22:54.498 --> 22:56.834
- So much for the free exchange of ideas.
- No, wait, wait, wait!

22:56.917 --> 22:59.211
What if Nixon is just like the emperor?

22:59.295 --> 23:01.297
But he's got no clothes, so...

23:03.173 --> 23:05.593
What was his name? I've literally
already forgotten who that was.

23:05.676 --> 23:08.387
Hey, hey, despite Tony's horrible idea,

23:08.470 --> 23:10.889
I think this magazine
is gonna hit it out of the park.

23:12.016 --> 23:13.100
- Come on!
- Shit.

23:13.183 --> 23:16.228
It's a total failure, we're selling
less than half our print run.

23:16.312 --> 23:18.314
And what is with the goddamn duck?

23:18.397 --> 23:20.899
- I never did get the duck.
- The duck is our mascot.

23:20.983 --> 23:23.652
Do you know what the cigarette companies
are telling me?

23:23.736 --> 23:26.905
"I'm not putting my ad
in this underground piece of shit!"

23:26.989 --> 23:28.073
It's ugly!

23:28.157 --> 23:32.369
It makes me physically ill to say this,
but I agree with Matty.

23:32.453 --> 23:33.704
Thank you, Henry.

23:37.207 --> 23:39.668
Okay, who cares if it's ugly?

23:39.752 --> 23:41.295
Comedy doesn't have to be pretty.

23:41.378 --> 23:42.546
It should be raw.

23:42.922 --> 23:43.756
Fucking rock and roll.

23:43.839 --> 23:45.966
Doug, we have to fire the art directors.

23:46.467 --> 23:48.802
What? But they hang out with David Bowie!

23:48.886 --> 23:52.139
I know that might not impress an heir
to Canadian woolen mills...

23:52.222 --> 23:54.224
- Hurtful.
- But their stuff is funny.

23:54.308 --> 23:56.810
No, it looks funny.

23:56.894 --> 23:58.479
Doug, there's a difference.

24:00.731 --> 24:03.942
<i>Matty and I had a meeting
with the art director for Family Health.</i>

24:04.026 --> 24:06.695
<i>Oh, Family Health!
Oh, that's a funny magazine.</i>

24:06.779 --> 24:08.113
Are you kidding me?

24:08.197 --> 24:09.031
Look.

24:11.116 --> 24:12.493
Okay. What am I looking at?

24:12.576 --> 24:16.330
He redesigned their old material.
Straight. Deadpan.

24:16.413 --> 24:18.332
So the art isn't fighting the joke.

24:18.957 --> 24:21.085
This is what your friends
down the hall did.

24:21.168 --> 24:22.461
And this is the new guy.

24:22.586 --> 24:23.462
Nostalgia

24:23.545 --> 24:24.797
I see what you're saying.

24:25.547 --> 24:26.590
It is pretty good.

24:27.925 --> 24:29.301
It's better.

24:32.054 --> 24:33.180
And the duck?

24:33.972 --> 24:35.099
No duck.

24:40.813 --> 24:44.024
Tempting.
I'm glad you finally saw the light.

24:44.108 --> 24:45.609
I can be very persuasive.

24:46.568 --> 24:47.903
If I fire those guys,

24:47.986 --> 24:50.280
they're gonna make me do
so much acid with them.

24:50.364 --> 24:52.366
- Then I'll fire them.
- No, I'll do it.

24:52.449 --> 24:54.451
Hey, guys. I got some bad news.

24:55.828 --> 24:56.662
Stay.

24:56.745 --> 24:58.247
Ladies, let's lift those drinks.

25:01.041 --> 25:01.959
Perfect.

25:05.087 --> 25:07.715
No, the arms should be like slightly bent.

25:22.980 --> 25:23.981
<i>Kenney, Beard!</i>

25:24.064 --> 25:27.192
We are being sued by Disney
for $8 million!

25:27.276 --> 25:29.361
Well, Matty, maybe it wasn't
such a hot idea

25:29.445 --> 25:31.363
to have Minnie Mouse flashing her tits.

25:31.447 --> 25:33.073
This was not my idea.

25:33.157 --> 25:34.742
I distinctly remember you saying,

25:34.825 --> 25:38.662
"Boys, it'll be fine, she has pasties on.
This is completely my idea."

25:38.746 --> 25:40.038
That does sound like Matty.

25:40.789 --> 25:41.874
You having fun yet?

25:41.957 --> 25:43.959
One could say fun is being had.

25:45.210 --> 25:46.837
Okay, Michael, let's do this.

25:49.047 --> 25:50.799
This is for the magazine, right?

25:54.928 --> 25:59.600
Volkswagen! Volkswagen is suing us
for $30 million over your ad.

26:00.350 --> 26:02.311
My ad!

26:02.394 --> 26:04.897
I can't tell you how great it feels
to be valued like this.

26:12.654 --> 26:14.615
The Mormons are protesting!

26:15.365 --> 26:16.867
The feminists hate us!

26:17.743 --> 26:20.579
The Catholics.
What did we do to the Catholics?

26:20.662 --> 26:22.080
Liza Minnelli?

26:22.164 --> 26:24.291
The American Nazi Party!

26:25.125 --> 26:27.002
Wait, this is fan mail.

26:27.085 --> 26:28.086
Such a good boy.

26:28.170 --> 26:31.256
He looks too happy.
I know that look. That dog is in paradise.

26:31.340 --> 26:33.467
Mary, I have to ask you
to step out of the shot.

26:33.550 --> 26:35.844
- You're not gonna hurt him, right?
- No, why would I hurt him?

26:35.928 --> 26:37.095
- What are you doing?
- Don't worry.

26:37.179 --> 26:38.847
- I don't think there's bullets in there.
- Should I fire?

26:38.931 --> 26:40.474
- Step back.
- Patches!

27:00.577 --> 27:02.079
<i>Kent Cigarettes.</i>

27:02.162 --> 27:03.580
<i>Panasonic Speakers.</i>

27:03.664 --> 27:05.249
<i>I sell dirty books.</i>

27:05.332 --> 27:07.417
Okay. Well, have a seat.

27:43.120 --> 27:45.914
I know, I wasn't around.

27:45.998 --> 27:49.585
Sometimes to create something special,
you need to stay in the office

27:49.668 --> 27:52.212
<i>as long as it takes
to get the work done.</i>

27:57.009 --> 27:57.843
Hey.

27:58.385 --> 27:59.261
Yeah.

27:59.344 --> 28:01.138
I have a confession to make.

28:02.347 --> 28:03.515
When we started, I never thought

28:03.599 --> 28:06.768
it would be much more
than the two of us writing jokes.

28:08.270 --> 28:09.438
Now it's turned into...

28:10.898 --> 28:11.940
all this.

28:13.942 --> 28:18.864
But as long as at the center of it,
it's you and me working together...

28:28.040 --> 28:29.708
McSorley's is still open.

28:30.876 --> 28:34.212
You want to grab a drink
and watch sailors hit on runaway teens?

28:38.300 --> 28:39.426
Doug?

28:42.054 --> 28:43.055
Doug.

28:59.947 --> 29:01.073
This one's funnier.

29:06.787 --> 29:09.831
Is there such a thing
as "over the line" to you?

29:09.915 --> 29:12.084
A lot of people think
your material goes too far.

29:12.167 --> 29:14.253
Well, a lot of people voted for Nixon.

29:15.379 --> 29:17.673
And I suppose those people
aren't "your people."

29:20.300 --> 29:21.969
Is that a marijuana cigarette?

29:25.597 --> 29:26.515
No.

29:28.600 --> 29:32.813
Let's talk about this,
the "Sexual Frustration" issue.

29:32.896 --> 29:35.440
There's a picture in here
that we can't even show

29:35.524 --> 29:37.985
of a naked black woman.

29:38.068 --> 29:39.236
You mean this?

29:41.613 --> 29:42.906
We'll have to cut that out.

29:42.990 --> 29:44.950
Oh, because of the size of her bush?

29:45.033 --> 29:48.412
Mr. Kenney, it's a fine line between
being clever and offensive, isn't it?

29:48.495 --> 29:51.581
<i>Look, if I could just say something
in defense of National Lampoon</i>

29:51.665 --> 29:53.417
- for one moment.
- Please.

29:54.042 --> 29:56.795
We come from a tradition of truth-tellers.

29:57.337 --> 30:01.591
Long time ago, there was someone else
society found offensive.

30:01.675 --> 30:05.387
They thought that what he did
was radical, dangerous.

30:05.470 --> 30:08.223
They persecuted him
and eventually killed him.

30:09.016 --> 30:10.809
Of course, I'm referring to Dracula.

30:15.355 --> 30:18.775
<i>This is Doug Kenney, folks,
of National Lampoon.</i>

30:18.859 --> 30:20.110
That's a humor magazine.

30:20.819 --> 30:22.237
Doing very well.

30:23.280 --> 30:25.157
Maybe we can do something about that.

30:26.325 --> 30:28.118
- You play tennis?
- Fuck you.

30:33.540 --> 30:34.458
Wow.

30:34.875 --> 30:35.917
Rough evening?

30:36.001 --> 30:38.712
No, Tony and I swapped vices
for the night.

30:38.795 --> 30:42.132
He smoked a joint,
and I drank a bottle of port.

30:42.215 --> 30:45.385
And what was the result
of this highly scientific experiment?

30:45.469 --> 30:48.764
Oh, we attacked a subway cop with a sword.
Where'd we get a sword?

30:48.847 --> 30:50.640
He has a deadline tomorrow.

30:50.724 --> 30:53.018
The cop? Don't worry, I'll fill his pages.

30:53.101 --> 30:56.021
That's funny.
You're already filling six pages.

30:56.104 --> 30:58.190
So? I can do ten. You know?

30:58.273 --> 31:00.942
Oh, O'Donoghue has this great idea!

31:01.026 --> 31:02.903
He thinks that we should do
our own radio show.

31:02.986 --> 31:07.407
Like this 1930s old-timey operation,
you know, with sketches and song parodies.

31:07.491 --> 31:08.325
What do you think?

31:09.326 --> 31:10.243
Tempting.

31:11.203 --> 31:13.872
Tempting good
or tempting I hate everything about it?

31:13.955 --> 31:15.624
We're barely able to put out a magazine.

31:15.707 --> 31:17.501
Then let's barely be able
to do something else.

31:17.584 --> 31:19.211
No, Doug. Radio?

31:19.878 --> 31:21.296
We're literary people.

31:21.380 --> 31:22.506
It'll be fine.

31:22.589 --> 31:24.549
- Don't I always come through?
- No.

31:24.633 --> 31:26.510
Well, someday I will.

31:26.593 --> 31:28.929
Are you worried about your little Dougie?

31:29.012 --> 31:30.013
I'm worried.

31:30.806 --> 31:32.974
Oh, hey, sweetie!
What are you still doing up?

31:33.058 --> 31:34.684
Have you been grading papers?

31:34.768 --> 31:36.770
You're taking on something else.

31:38.105 --> 31:42.859
Well, would you rather
I just stop then, not be successful?

31:43.318 --> 31:45.070
You are successful, Doug.

31:45.612 --> 31:47.072
- Alex...
- Good night.

31:47.781 --> 31:50.992
Oh, okay, just for the record,
you're the one who's walking away!

31:56.581 --> 31:59.167
You made Mary Marshmallow
a managing editor?

31:59.543 --> 32:01.586
Mary's been with us since day one.

32:01.670 --> 32:05.507
She is a secretary
who happens to have enormous breasts.

32:05.590 --> 32:06.591
That's just sexist.

32:06.675 --> 32:08.969
You wrote a piece called "Marshmallows"

32:09.052 --> 32:11.721
about people having sex
with marshmallows.

32:12.055 --> 32:13.056
Coincidence.

32:13.640 --> 32:14.641
You're fucking her.

32:14.724 --> 32:15.934
That's coincidence, too.

32:16.643 --> 32:19.646
- I'll figure it out. I'm gonna tell Alex.
- No, don't...

32:21.064 --> 32:22.274
That's not my business.

32:24.151 --> 32:25.777
<i>The Lampoon is my business.</i>

32:26.403 --> 32:27.529
And you're my friend.

32:28.447 --> 32:29.448
So...

32:30.574 --> 32:32.701
if you're gonna take on
all this extra stuff,

32:32.784 --> 32:35.162
just remember there's only one of you.

32:36.663 --> 32:41.084
The radio show will be O'Donoghue's thing.
I won't be involved.

32:42.794 --> 32:44.129
We have a lot of fun,

32:44.212 --> 32:47.591
but Ed Sullivan is one
of our great entertainers...

32:47.674 --> 32:50.677
and I had a thought in the cab
on the way to the studio tonight,

32:50.760 --> 32:54.514
what if Ed Sullivan were tortured?

32:54.598 --> 32:56.516
And when I say tortured, I mean,

32:56.600 --> 32:59.478
what if steel needles,
say six-inches long,

32:59.561 --> 33:02.230
were plunged into his eyeballs?

33:02.689 --> 33:06.067
I think it would go something like this.

33:11.907 --> 33:12.824
Oh, my God!

33:19.122 --> 33:22.918
<i>This National Lampoon Radio Hour
contains sexually explicit material</i>

33:23.001 --> 33:26.213
and other adult content
that children should not be exposed to.

33:26.296 --> 33:29.132
We probably should have warned you
of that at the top of the show.

33:29.841 --> 33:31.927
Okay, so I was involved.

33:32.010 --> 33:34.346
<i>We built our own studio
on Madison Avenue</i>

33:34.429 --> 33:37.265
<i>and hired some talented performers
who would work for bus fare.</i>

33:37.349 --> 33:39.726
Could I have Flexie the Pocket Monkey?

33:40.936 --> 33:44.314
No, you may not have
Flexie the Pocket Monkey.

33:45.357 --> 33:48.902
I'd like a sandwich with mayo
and red lettuce on rye,

33:48.985 --> 33:50.529
with a little bacon and egg,

33:50.612 --> 33:53.114
like a dream,
with a lot of ketchup and mustard.

33:54.533 --> 33:57.369
Guys, I think Coach is talking
about the Big Man.

33:58.745 --> 33:59.704
The league commissioner.

33:59.788 --> 34:02.082
No, what I mean is you've got leukoplakia.

34:03.458 --> 34:06.086
You start off with cute jokes
and you end up with atheistic trash,

34:06.169 --> 34:08.964
<i>like this December issue
of The National Lampoon!</i>

34:10.005 --> 34:13.301
Yeah, so these actors don't look
exactly like the real people.

34:13.385 --> 34:17.264
But come on, do you think I looked
like Will Forte when I was 27?

34:17.347 --> 34:19.391
You think Will Forte is 27?

34:20.016 --> 34:22.101
<i>Here's some other things

34:22.185 --> 34:24.062
<i>for pacing, dramatic impact,</i>

34:24.145 --> 34:26.022
<i>or just 'cause we felt like it.</i>

Hey, here, I'm coming in right here.

34:30.777 --> 34:33.697
Wait. Wait, uh, Gilda. So do that again.

34:33.780 --> 34:35.407
Start the band up, make them go,

34:35.489 --> 34:37.158
and then all you guys
stop her immediately.

34:37.242 --> 34:38.618
Okay.

34:42.414 --> 34:44.291
- No! Stop!
- It's not right.

34:45.375 --> 34:47.585
<i>Between the magazine and the radio show,</i>

34:47.668 --> 34:50.045
<i>I barely had time for my other hobbies,</i>

34:50.130 --> 34:51.922
<i>like being a terrible husband.</i>

34:52.924 --> 34:55.092
"Doug Kenney is
the handsomest man in comedy"?

34:55.594 --> 34:56.969
Their words, not mine.

34:57.053 --> 34:59.222
Actually, it's a direct quote from you.

34:59.306 --> 35:01.516
Hmm, I'm sure they fact-checked it.

35:02.225 --> 35:04.686
"The staff considers Henry
to be the dad of the magazine,

35:04.769 --> 35:08.106
while Doug is like the mom
who keeps hitting the cooking sherry."

35:08.189 --> 35:11.401
Oh, Sherry does more than cook,
and I would never hit her.

35:12.902 --> 35:14.988
Do you only talk in one-liners?

35:15.071 --> 35:16.865
I also know some dirty limericks.

35:19.200 --> 35:20.994
I thought you were with Mary.

35:21.077 --> 35:22.537
I'm with a lot of people.

36:07.415 --> 36:09.167
Goodbye, Doug.

36:36.361 --> 36:37.278
Hey, Doug.

36:38.530 --> 36:42.659
Uh... I left a sketch to punch up, but...

36:43.535 --> 36:46.121
Don't worry about it. I know you have
a lot on your mind right now.

36:46.204 --> 36:48.081
Thank you, but it's okay. It's okay.

36:52.877 --> 36:55.004
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

36:56.339 --> 36:57.716
I mean, with Alex.

36:58.174 --> 37:02.303
If you want to talk about it,
I am a licensed chiropractor.

37:02.721 --> 37:04.723
In Honduras. Parts of Honduras.

37:04.806 --> 37:06.349
I appreciate that. Yeah.

37:06.433 --> 37:09.352
- Doug, if you want my advice...
- Hold that thought.

37:13.106 --> 37:16.317
Done. Here's your sketch.
I was stuck on that last line.

37:17.277 --> 37:21.906
You were punching up my sketch
while I was attempting to be earnest?

37:21.990 --> 37:26.244
Look, I know I fucked up.
I'm fucked up, all right?

37:26.327 --> 37:29.080
But there's
just too much work to be done, huh?

37:29.164 --> 37:31.416
I mean, we have a nation to amuse.

37:31.499 --> 37:35.253
We're at war, son,
and it's our duty to serve.

37:35.336 --> 37:36.504
Doug, we can't afford any...

37:36.588 --> 37:40.008
<i>Now, let me tell you what it's like
to run a successful comedy empire.</i>

37:40.091 --> 37:43.136
<i>The more ads you sell in the magazine,
the more pages you print.</i>

37:43.219 --> 37:45.138
<i>Someone has to write those pages.</i>

37:45.221 --> 37:47.640
<i>Then there's the other pieces to edit,
art to commission,</i>

37:47.724 --> 37:50.393
<i>headlines, captions and cartoons to fix,</i>

37:50.477 --> 37:51.686
<i>all on a deadline.</i>

37:51.770 --> 37:54.481
<i>On top of that,
you expand into books, albums,</i>

37:54.564 --> 37:55.774
<i>then, oh, the radio show</i>

37:55.857 --> 37:58.026
<i>based on your successful magazine
is also successful.</i>

37:58.109 --> 38:00.945
<i>And holy shit,
an hour is a lot of time to fill.</i>

38:01.029 --> 38:03.531
<i>Couldn't we have called it
The National Lampoon Radio Half-Hour?</i>

38:03.615 --> 38:05.200
If we don't cut that gag
about Nixon's daughter,

38:05.283 --> 38:06.951
RCA is gonna drop the album!

38:07.035 --> 38:08.912
<i>Then you start a live show.</i>

38:08.995 --> 38:10.705
<i>And that's a hit, too.</i>

38:10.789 --> 38:13.583
<i>Yes, I know success is a great thing,
that we all want,</i>

38:13.666 --> 38:16.920
<i>but I'm trying to explain
why maybe you can't handle it.</i>

38:17.003 --> 38:19.047
<i>To deal with the stress, you smoke dope,</i>

38:19.130 --> 38:20.840
<i>but that makes it harder
to meet the deadlines,</i>

38:20.924 --> 38:22.634
<i>and someone else has to pick up the slack.</i>

38:23.968 --> 38:26.137
Doug! How much time
did you spend on this coupon?

38:26.221 --> 38:29.432
<i>Well, shit, maybe a little LSD
for inspiration would help,</i>

38:29.516 --> 38:32.185
<i>but now it's five hours later,
and you're still tripping,</i>

38:32.268 --> 38:35.605
<i>and that thing you wrote
makes no sense, even to you.</i>

38:35.688 --> 38:38.024
<i>You feel bad about
letting your partner down.</i>

38:38.107 --> 38:40.777
<i>Not that one. No, that one.
Well, that one, too.</i>

38:40.860 --> 38:43.154
<i>- Doug!
- Are you even listening to me?</i>

38:43.238 --> 38:45.406
<i>You probably shouldn't stay out so late,</i>

38:45.490 --> 38:48.243
<i>but you want to prove that you can run
with Chevy and Belushi.</i>

38:49.160 --> 38:52.163
<i>Tony slept with O'Donoghue's girl,
and now O'Donoghue won't work with him.</i>

38:52.247 --> 38:55.750
<i>Anne says you're all sexist,
which is true, but that's not the point.</i>

38:55.834 --> 38:58.753
<i>And oh, right, the magazine circulation
is how high now?</i>

38:58.837 --> 39:01.422
<i>- Doug. Doug. Doug.
- You'll just be over here in your office.</i>

39:04.592 --> 39:06.094
Doug?

39:06.177 --> 39:08.346
Doug? Come on, Doug.

39:08.429 --> 39:09.305
- Doug!
- Doug!

39:09.889 --> 39:10.807
- Doug!
- Doug!

39:33.997 --> 39:34.998
Doug?

39:36.124 --> 39:38.001
Doug, did you break the machine again?

39:39.961 --> 39:40.962
Doug?

40:10.867 --> 40:11.701
Doug?

40:11.784 --> 40:14.787
Peter, Lucy,
is this where the college reunion is?

40:14.871 --> 40:16.956
Hey, man, good to see you.

40:19.125 --> 40:22.337
"To produce a mighty book,
you must choose a mighty theme.

40:22.921 --> 40:26.507
No great and enduring volume
can ever be written on the flea,

40:27.175 --> 40:29.636
though many there be who have tried it.

40:29.719 --> 40:32.597
'Ere entering upon the subject
of fossil whales.

40:33.348 --> 40:34.849
<i>I present my credentials."</i>

40:50.782 --> 40:52.617
All right. Let's go.

40:53.701 --> 40:54.702
Doug.

40:55.787 --> 40:56.746
Come on.

40:59.499 --> 41:00.541
Doug.

41:00.625 --> 41:02.919
He can stay in the car for all I care.

41:08.007 --> 41:10.051
Thanks for coming. He'll be missed.

41:11.552 --> 41:15.264
My brother. Dad's favorite.
Kidney failure.

41:15.348 --> 41:17.892
"The golden boy who died too soon."

41:18.768 --> 41:22.647
See why I didn't want to start the movie
with this stuff? It's a total bummer.

41:23.815 --> 41:25.817
<i>You know the nice thing
about dying young?</i>

41:25.900 --> 41:28.194
<i>You stay perfectly frozen in time.</i>

41:28.277 --> 41:30.154
<i>You never have to grow up.</i>

41:30.238 --> 41:32.532
"Entering upon the subject
of fossil whales,

41:32.615 --> 41:34.784
I present my credentials as a geologist."

41:34.867 --> 41:35.702
Lucy?

41:37.120 --> 41:37.954
Yeah?

41:38.579 --> 41:40.081
I did the right thing, right?

41:41.374 --> 41:42.625
I had to leave.

41:42.709 --> 41:44.460
- I know.
- Right?

41:44.544 --> 41:47.130
I just didn't...
I didn't know how to do it anymore.

41:49.340 --> 41:50.967
How do you think
they're doing without you?

41:51.050 --> 41:53.845
Oh, they're big boys.
They can handle themselves.

41:53.928 --> 41:55.847
Michael, you're being unreasonable.

41:55.930 --> 41:57.974
<i>Somebody really didn't like
The Vietnamese Baby Book.</i>

41:58.057 --> 41:59.475
Is it wrong that I'm jealous?

41:59.559 --> 42:02.145
I always knew I'd die from dynamite
being sent to an office,

42:02.228 --> 42:03.062
but not like this.

42:03.146 --> 42:06.065
Guys, we have to evacuate.
Come on, everybody, move, move, move!

42:06.149 --> 42:07.567
- Michael.
- Come on.

42:07.650 --> 42:11.195
- To think, Tom Jones only gets panties.
- Stop smoking. That's not safe.

42:11.320 --> 42:13.781
If you put it down,
I'll let you take me to dinner.

42:14.157 --> 42:16.325
- I'm listening.
- Hi, is this the city desk?

42:16.409 --> 42:18.953
- I have a story for you.
- Don't be a bunch of sissies.

42:19.037 --> 42:22.248
If the nitroglycerin hasn't leaked out,
it's harmless. I could eat it.

42:22.331 --> 42:23.416
But it has leaked out.

42:23.499 --> 42:26.794
That's what I'm telling you, is that
the nitroglycerin, it's leaked out.

42:26.878 --> 42:28.838
- Shit.
- All right, come on. Come on.

42:28.921 --> 42:31.340
- Let's get him out of here
- That is my dynamite!

42:31.758 --> 42:32.759
It was addressed to me.

42:32.842 --> 42:35.261
You can't have my dynamite,
you fascist goons!

42:35.344 --> 42:37.805
- That's L-a-m-p-o-o-n.
- That is mine! Mine!

42:37.889 --> 42:39.974
- Oh, he's coming back.
- Mine!

42:40.058 --> 42:41.601
It's mine! Mine! Gimme! Gimme!

42:41.684 --> 42:43.019
- Rape!
- Stay back, sir.

42:43.102 --> 42:45.521
I'm warning you
that I'm going to rape you. Ow!

42:47.023 --> 42:48.983
I don't want to kick him out,
but he's been here for weeks.

42:49.067 --> 42:52.070
He needs us right now. Maybe we should
take him to the carousel again.

42:52.153 --> 42:53.404
No. Hey.

42:55.281 --> 42:56.282
What's this?

42:56.824 --> 42:59.744
<i>Oh, this is
Teenage Commies From Outer Space.</i>

42:59.827 --> 43:01.829
The great American novel.
I finally started writing it.

43:02.246 --> 43:04.415
- That's great, Doug.
- Yeah. Thank you.

43:04.499 --> 43:06.751
It's 1956 and aliens attack.

43:06.834 --> 43:09.462
It's like Salinger
meets Mark Twain on acid.

43:09.837 --> 43:10.713
- Wow.
- Yeah.

43:10.797 --> 43:13.674
They're sharing a drink with Bukowski
while going down on Jane Austen.

43:13.758 --> 43:15.551
Just stay with that metaphor for a second.

43:15.635 --> 43:18.638
Oh, no, here comes James Joyce.
He's got some baby oil.

43:21.265 --> 43:23.935
As you go through it,
pay attention to what you're doing

43:24.018 --> 43:26.312
so I don't have to deal with it.
That's the whole point.

43:26.395 --> 43:27.480
Where's my stuff?

43:27.605 --> 43:29.941
- I know what a dictionary is.
- Henry, where's my stuff?

43:30.024 --> 43:33.027
- I don't know where your stuff is.
- Okay, cut the bullshit, I want an answer!

43:33.111 --> 43:35.279
- Whose stuff is on my desk?
- I don't know whose stuff...

43:35.363 --> 43:37.949
We were gone for two days,
and you gave her desk away?

43:38.032 --> 43:40.034
Doug's gone for months,
but you don't touch his desk.

43:40.118 --> 43:41.744
You won't put my stuff in the magazine,

43:41.828 --> 43:43.704
now you really want
to send a message, right?

43:43.788 --> 43:46.791
- Clearly, you hate women.
- Look, it was probably the cleaners.

43:46.874 --> 43:48.417
- Then fire those bitches, okay?
- Henry.

43:48.501 --> 43:51.420
Because here's the option,
either they go or we go.

43:51.504 --> 43:55.925
Henry. Henry. This water fountain
hasn't been operational in 15 days.

43:58.344 --> 43:59.720
That's what you've been
saying "Henry" for?

43:59.804 --> 44:00.638
I'm very thirsty.

44:00.721 --> 44:05.143
Look, you're not quitting.
We'll talk to Matty. He'll smooth it over.

44:05.226 --> 44:07.436
I would rather butt-fuck cancer...

44:07.937 --> 44:09.897
- God.
- than shake hands with Matty Simmons.

44:09.981 --> 44:12.066
- It's called...
- This is half what you owe me,

44:12.150 --> 44:13.234
you cheap fuck.

44:13.317 --> 44:15.278
Between the ticket sales
and the albums...

44:15.361 --> 44:18.906
<i>It's National Lampoon's Lemmings
not Tony Hendra's Lemmings.</i>

44:18.990 --> 44:19.907
What are you doing?

44:21.868 --> 44:23.494
I'd like to report a robbery, please.

44:23.578 --> 44:24.453
Okay, come on.

44:24.537 --> 44:28.583
A man called Matty Simmons,
whom I have apprehended at 635 Madison,

44:28.666 --> 44:30.001
has stolen money from me.

44:30.084 --> 44:31.252
And another thing.

44:31.752 --> 44:34.547
If I choose to bring a grenade to work,

44:34.630 --> 44:37.300
that is my right as an Irish-American!

44:37.842 --> 44:38.885
- You people.
- What the hell, man?

44:39.594 --> 44:41.846
You people. You're dangerous.

44:41.929 --> 44:43.347
- Let's go.
- Are you all right?

44:47.393 --> 44:48.769
Holy shit.

44:52.773 --> 44:57.361
I left a half-empty grape Fanta here.
Has anyone seen it?

44:58.446 --> 44:59.280
No?

45:00.781 --> 45:02.116
It was about yay big.

45:09.749 --> 45:12.460
Should I be
for the Black Panthers or against?

45:16.756 --> 45:19.425
So, uh... what's going on?

45:20.176 --> 45:21.218
What's going on?

45:22.762 --> 45:24.055
Well...

45:24.138 --> 45:25.556
O'Donoghue quit again.

45:26.223 --> 45:28.851
He and Anne are now dating,
so she quit, too.

45:28.935 --> 45:32.355
Tony stole a sketch from Monty Python
and used it in Lemmings,

45:32.438 --> 45:33.981
which is fantastic.

45:34.523 --> 45:38.027
And Matty is claiming he can't afford
to buy us out next year,

45:38.110 --> 45:40.529
in flagrant violation of our contract.

45:41.530 --> 45:43.324
Oh. Gosh.

45:43.991 --> 45:47.328
But, you know,
I meant, what's going on with you?

45:47.745 --> 45:49.580
That is what's going on with me.

45:50.831 --> 45:52.583
This is what you left me with.

45:54.335 --> 45:57.171
Well, it wasn't
a completely wasted breakdown.

45:57.755 --> 45:58.881
I finished the novel.

46:11.936 --> 46:14.605
- You want me to read this now?
- Would you?

46:19.527 --> 46:21.028
<i>Teenage Commies From Outer Space.</i>

46:40.673 --> 46:41.674
It's...

46:45.344 --> 46:46.887
- It sucks.
- Yeah.

46:49.432 --> 46:51.183
It's done. It's not worth talking about.

46:54.145 --> 46:55.980
It's good to have you back, Doug.

46:58.774 --> 47:00.818
<i>And then February can be
the Strange Sex issue.</i>

47:00.901 --> 47:05.489
<i>Yes. The Strange Sex... And we should
do an issue within the issue,</i>

47:05.573 --> 47:06.782
<i>The National Lampoof.</i>

47:07.825 --> 47:10.911
<i>Instead of Our Bodies, Ourselves,
Our Bodies, None of Your Business.</i>

47:10.995 --> 47:12.580
None of your business.

47:12.663 --> 47:14.415
<i>A magazine, Playdead.</i>

47:14.498 --> 47:18.919
Erotic photos of women's corpses

47:19.003 --> 47:21.672
hanging from nooses, head in the oven,

47:21.756 --> 47:24.341
- maybe one of them fell down the stairs.
- Jesus Christ.

47:24.425 --> 47:27.470
I was thinking
we could write up Nixon's resume,

47:27.553 --> 47:29.764
you know, now that he's back
on the job market?

47:31.057 --> 47:33.893
Yes, like the piece PJ has
in the current issue,

47:33.976 --> 47:36.645
which is available on newsstands,
if you want to buy a copy,

47:36.729 --> 47:38.981
- you could use it as research.
- Okay, Tony. Yeah.

47:39.065 --> 47:41.275
We had something like that
in the last issue. It's not important.

47:41.358 --> 47:44.945
- I think "play dead" is the way to go.
- We'll let Brian get all the dead bodies.

47:45.029 --> 47:47.782
<i>- A braille version of The Joy of Sex.
- Oh, my gosh.</i>

47:47.865 --> 47:50.284
Hey, where's my tennis racket?

47:51.368 --> 47:54.205
I used to keep my tennis racket
behind the filing cabinet.

47:54.288 --> 47:55.122
Hey, Doug.

47:55.623 --> 47:57.124
Doug. One second.

47:57.708 --> 47:58.918
Glory hole page

47:59.001 --> 48:02.797
and have an illustration
of a lavatory cubicle on the back.

48:02.880 --> 48:04.715
- A lavatory cubicle.
- And...

48:05.508 --> 48:07.009
Is this about the tennis racket?

48:07.093 --> 48:08.761
Uh, no.

48:08.844 --> 48:13.224
Um... listen, I was thinking maybe
you could do another special project.

48:13.307 --> 48:14.141
- You know?
- Yeah?

48:14.225 --> 48:16.102
Away from normal deadlines.

48:16.185 --> 48:17.686
You'll get out of the office.

48:17.770 --> 48:20.564
You could do it with PJ.
What do you think?

48:21.607 --> 48:23.067
- Sound good?
- Do you need smokes?

48:23.150 --> 48:24.443
- Yeah.
- He's gonna go get smokes.

48:25.694 --> 48:27.780
What about a map
to glory holes in your neighborhood?

48:27.863 --> 48:29.406
- It just says, "Your house."
- What'd I miss?

48:29.490 --> 48:30.825
These people don't need encouragement.

48:31.492 --> 48:33.828
A cartoon, "Jewish Moon Landing."

48:35.037 --> 48:36.705
Sort of a differently-shaped helmet.

48:36.789 --> 48:39.708
<i>I'm not sure if Henry was trying
to save me from embarrassment</i>

48:39.792 --> 48:43.254
<i>or if he truly believed
I could still create the great American...</i>

48:43.337 --> 48:44.755
<i>I don't know, something.</i>

48:45.339 --> 48:47.424
<i>But either way, we found it.</i>

48:47.508 --> 48:50.761
<i>An idea full of paranoia and nostalgia,</i>

48:50.845 --> 48:53.848
<i>the meaningless cruelty
of being young in America.</i>

48:54.515 --> 48:56.475
<i>The high school yearbook.</i>

48:56.642 --> 48:58.144
They're all the same.

48:58.227 --> 49:01.105
It's like every single shop teacher went
to the same barber.

49:01.188 --> 49:02.857
It's authoritarian government, man.

49:02.940 --> 49:04.900
It's like we're living
in an oppressed nation.

49:04.984 --> 49:06.152
Yes, it is.

49:06.235 --> 49:08.445
Salute to the seniors.
Yes, this is exactly...

49:08.529 --> 49:10.072
They make you salute these people.

49:10.156 --> 49:12.700
They all have thousand-yard stares,
you know what I mean?

49:18.539 --> 49:21.792
You wonder why Nixon's the way he is,
it's because he went to high school, man.

49:22.793 --> 49:26.213
Chess club, glee club, future homemakers.

49:26.297 --> 49:29.967
Everything screwed up about our culture,
it all begins right here.

49:30.050 --> 49:31.135
All these forced smiles.

49:31.218 --> 49:32.970
You know, whether we know it or not,

49:33.053 --> 49:36.182
every high school sorts us
into the same exact types.

49:36.265 --> 49:38.309
It's Nazi social engineering.

49:38.392 --> 49:39.393
Bully,

49:39.476 --> 49:40.477
introvert,

49:40.561 --> 49:41.770
teacher's pet,

49:41.854 --> 49:42.813
delinquent,

49:42.897 --> 49:44.023
foreign exchange student,

49:44.106 --> 49:45.357
virgin,

49:45.441 --> 49:47.651
perfect perky princess,

49:47.735 --> 49:49.278
Spazzy McSpaz,

49:49.361 --> 49:51.155
wacky class clown.

49:53.991 --> 49:55.326
<i>There's a type for everyone.</i>

49:55.409 --> 49:57.036
<i>Whether you're the rich dick,</i>

49:57.119 --> 49:58.412
<i>future homosexual,</i>

49:58.495 --> 50:00.080
<i>beatnik, tramp,</i>

50:00.164 --> 50:01.373
<i>overlooked black kid,</i>

50:01.457 --> 50:02.583
<i>the dictator,</i>

50:02.666 --> 50:03.667
<i>the nobody,</i>

50:03.751 --> 50:05.836
<i>and, of course, the kid who died.</i>

50:06.545 --> 50:09.965
<i>This was the best Senior Year ever,
except for the tragic deaths</i>

50:10.049 --> 50:12.968
<i>of Howard Havermeyer
and President Kennedy,</i>

50:13.052 --> 50:14.595
<i>and the car accident after prom.</i>

50:15.179 --> 50:16.347
All right, ready, girls?

50:16.972 --> 50:19.683
Three, two, one.

50:23.729 --> 50:26.523
"The Lampoon's hit parody
of the high school yearbook,

50:26.607 --> 50:29.693
now on track
to sell over one million copies,

50:29.777 --> 50:34.323
is the greatest example of group writing
since the King James Bible."

50:34.406 --> 50:36.867
- And you didn't write a word of it.
- I'm in the group.

50:36.951 --> 50:40.162
We all work together. I mean,
I gave everyone credit for "Lemmings."

50:40.246 --> 50:42.456
- I must have missed that.
- Matty.

50:42.539 --> 50:44.124
Those two look armed for battle.

50:44.208 --> 50:46.794
Well, it's been five years.
Matty has to buy them out.

50:47.461 --> 50:49.797
Time to feast on the fatted calf.

50:53.342 --> 50:55.177
Matty, we need to talk about this now.

50:55.261 --> 50:57.805
Look, I know why you're here.
I know what day it is.

50:58.639 --> 50:59.723
Let me explain this.

50:59.807 --> 51:01.976
You boys are victims of your own success.

51:02.059 --> 51:04.603
I don't have the cash
to pay you ten times earnings.

51:04.979 --> 51:07.731
We got too much earnings.
I can't cover it.

51:07.815 --> 51:10.943
My apologies for making the yearbook
such a hit. I'll aim lower next time.

51:11.026 --> 51:12.278
You signed a contract.

51:12.361 --> 51:15.322
He didn't fulfill his contract, did he?
He disappeared on us.

51:15.406 --> 51:18.117
I still put out the fucking magazine.
Every month.

51:18.200 --> 51:20.119
We just want to be paid what we deserve.

51:20.202 --> 51:22.705
I know. Here's what I can do now. Okay?

51:22.788 --> 51:24.790
More stock. A lot more stock,

51:24.873 --> 51:28.043
and I pay the entire sum off
in ten years. Okay?

51:28.127 --> 51:31.088
I mean, doesn't that sound better
than fucking Matty over a barrel?

51:34.049 --> 51:35.092
I knew it.

51:35.175 --> 51:36.844
<i>I had to get Henry what he deserved.</i>

51:36.927 --> 51:38.887
<i>And the only way to change Matty's mind</i>

51:38.971 --> 51:42.933
<i>was a well thought out argument,
delivered clearly and calmly.</i>

51:44.226 --> 51:45.811
No, no, no, no, no!

51:45.894 --> 51:46.854
We want our money!

51:46.937 --> 51:49.732
I fucked up, fine.
But Henry kept it going.

51:49.815 --> 51:51.317
And we want our money! Now!

51:51.817 --> 51:52.651
Henry.

51:55.070 --> 51:56.488
Come on. Let's go! Do it!

51:58.907 --> 52:00.451
- Hey!
- We want our money!

52:00.534 --> 52:01.994
I think it's going well.

52:02.077 --> 52:03.620
I'm going for the checks.

52:06.373 --> 52:07.708
You two are pirates.

52:08.417 --> 52:09.460
Here's a pen.

52:13.589 --> 52:14.757
You assholes.

52:15.257 --> 52:16.884
Do you know what you've done?

52:16.967 --> 52:17.885
You've ruined me.

52:17.968 --> 52:20.137
You've ruined this company. You know that.

52:21.221 --> 52:22.639
We made this company.

52:28.020 --> 52:29.646
We should celebrate, huh?

52:30.439 --> 52:32.608
Come on, let's go buy you a new pipe.

52:33.692 --> 52:34.902
Henry?

52:35.402 --> 52:36.779
Tempting?

52:36.862 --> 52:38.906
They're all expecting a slice of the pie.

52:42.159 --> 52:43.869
It could get rather awkward.

52:43.952 --> 52:46.121
I don't get it. What's the bit?

52:48.916 --> 52:50.167
You might need those.

52:51.418 --> 52:53.003
I'm digging the commitment.

52:55.381 --> 52:57.591
You said if it ever stopped being fun...

52:58.884 --> 52:59.718
So...

53:00.761 --> 53:03.055
We just got the money.
I just got us the money.

53:03.138 --> 53:05.432
No, you got Matty
to write us a check, Doug.

53:05.933 --> 53:07.101
I earned that money.

53:08.644 --> 53:11.271
- I'm done.
- Okay, look, we can hire more editors.

53:11.355 --> 53:13.273
- We'll focus on the writing.
- I don't want to go back.

53:13.357 --> 53:15.776
- Just you and me, like it used to be.
- I want to move on.

53:15.859 --> 53:19.238
Wait. What's that supposed to mean?
You want to move on from us?

53:19.321 --> 53:21.156
It means I'm tired of taking care of you.

53:24.535 --> 53:26.578
What are you gonna do all day, huh?

53:28.330 --> 53:29.164
Come on.

53:30.833 --> 53:32.042
You can't leave.

53:33.293 --> 53:34.294
You did.

53:39.883 --> 53:40.884
You'll be fine.

53:42.428 --> 53:44.388
Don't forget to feed and water them.

53:45.431 --> 53:46.265
Henry.

53:48.183 --> 53:51.019
Good luck. Fuck you. Goodbye.

54:03.407 --> 54:04.700
Who gets his office?

54:10.622 --> 54:13.917
<i>PJ, this Esquire parody's a mess.</i>

54:14.001 --> 54:16.587
I gotta run into a meeting.
Can you do a quick rewrite?

54:24.470 --> 54:25.846
Does this sound familiar?

54:25.929 --> 54:27.723
I feel terrible.

54:27.806 --> 54:31.101
Oh, honey. Just a few days ago
you were feeling swell.

54:31.185 --> 54:33.061
Gee, Dad,
kind of like what happened to Doug Kenney.

54:33.145 --> 54:36.231
Exactly, son. I feel just like
that piece of garbage Doug Kenney.

54:36.315 --> 54:40.194
Feeling like Doug Kenney,
a chronic condition with no known cure.

54:40.277 --> 54:43.489
<i>Symptoms include loneliness,
uselessness</i>

54:43.572 --> 54:45.324
<i>and a crushing sense of regret.</i>

54:45.407 --> 54:48.035
<i>I heard Matty Simmons,
you know, the publisher?</i>

54:48.118 --> 54:49.620
<i>Sure, I know Matty. Great guy.</i>

54:49.703 --> 54:52.748
<i>Well, he put PJ O'Rourke
in charge of the magazine</i>

54:52.831 --> 54:55.667
<i>because Doug couldn't handle
something like that.</i>

54:55.751 --> 54:59.338
<i>It could happen to you or someone
in your church or Masonic Lodge.</i>

54:59.421 --> 55:00.923
Feeling like Doug Kenney.

55:01.006 --> 55:06.595
Seek treatment before you become
permanently, irreversibly unlovable.

55:15.646 --> 55:17.272
- It's hereditary!
- I'm telling you.

55:17.356 --> 55:20.901
- Have you ever heard of anybody like this?
- No.

55:20.984 --> 55:22.194
I'll see you outside.

55:22.277 --> 55:23.612
Right behind you.

55:24.363 --> 55:28.325
Excuse me.
Did you play Abigail Adams on PBS?

55:28.408 --> 55:31.411
Oh, I didn't play Abigail Adams.

55:32.162 --> 55:34.289
I became Abigail Adams.

55:35.040 --> 55:36.833
I didn't think there were
any PBS viewers here.

55:36.917 --> 55:40.295
Oh, no, I don't watch. Somebody had just
described it in great detail.

55:40.379 --> 55:43.382
You seem like generally
what they were describing.

55:43.465 --> 55:46.426
- Mm-hmm.
- Like an Abigail Adams type.

55:46.510 --> 55:48.971
Kathryn. I'm the woman you're hitting on.

55:49.054 --> 55:52.683
Doug Kenney, Chagrin Falls, Ohio.
I'm the woman who's hitting on you.

55:53.267 --> 55:55.727
What do you say we get out of here?
Get something to eat, huh?

55:55.811 --> 55:57.354
At three a. m.?

55:57.437 --> 56:00.023
Yeah, you're right.
We should probably just eat here, huh?

56:02.234 --> 56:03.443
Oh, fuck.

56:03.527 --> 56:05.904
What's wrong?
Do I have glass in my teeth?

56:07.072 --> 56:08.699
I kind of conquered the publishing thing.

56:08.782 --> 56:11.952
I'm probably gonna release an album
of Gregorian chants next.

56:12.536 --> 56:14.079
I'm gonna make an epic movie,

56:14.162 --> 56:17.165
<i>kind of Gone With The Wind
meets Citizen Kane, but better.</i>

56:17.708 --> 56:19.167
- And longer.
- You're going Hollywood.

56:19.251 --> 56:21.461
Oh, I'm so Hollywood, you don't even know.

56:21.545 --> 56:24.131
I'm gonna change my name
to Charlton Hepburn.

56:59.082 --> 57:00.250
I remembered something.

57:12.262 --> 57:14.306
I don't usually kiss on the first date.

57:14.389 --> 57:16.266
Well, I don't consider this a date.

57:16.350 --> 57:18.435
Then let's go back to my place and screw.

57:22.147 --> 57:25.108
<i>So Kathryn came into my life
just when I needed her,</i>

57:25.192 --> 57:28.403
<i>but nobody can just swoop in
and fix you right away.</i>

57:28.487 --> 57:30.989
I was still struggling
with the same anxieties,

57:31.073 --> 57:33.700
but now with millions of dollars
that frankly...

57:34.117 --> 57:37.371
frankly I had no idea
what I was going to do with them.

57:49.174 --> 57:50.384
You bought your parents this?

57:51.009 --> 57:52.678
Way to establish dominance.

57:52.761 --> 57:54.137
Surprise!

57:54.221 --> 57:57.265
What are you doing here?
Is that a Porsche?

57:57.349 --> 57:59.518
Gorgeous. Just gorgeous.

57:59.601 --> 58:02.270
You know, she was the first member
of her tribe to wear shoes.

58:02.354 --> 58:03.689
What is that?

58:03.772 --> 58:06.817
Well, Dad complained about the lawn.
Told me it was too much to mow.

58:06.900 --> 58:08.235
So...

58:08.318 --> 58:10.237
Get out of here, lawnmowers.

58:10.320 --> 58:13.115
- Here we go. Come on. That's it.
- Really fun, Doug.

58:13.198 --> 58:15.617
Now the mower will be shitting on my lawn.

58:15.701 --> 58:19.371
Yeah. It's called fertilizer, Dad.
They threw that in for free.

58:19.454 --> 58:20.622
You stay here.

58:20.706 --> 58:24.251
So, you work with Doug,
doing the comedy?

58:24.334 --> 58:27.295
Oh... it never feels like work with Doug.

58:28.255 --> 58:30.632
But now I'm about to star
in a new TV show.

58:30.716 --> 58:32.509
How wonderful.

58:32.592 --> 58:34.261
We'll have to watch, won't we?

58:34.344 --> 58:35.345
Mm-hmm.

58:36.596 --> 58:40.767
You must be so proud of him.
All his success at such a young age...

58:41.226 --> 58:42.769
all the while being color-blind.

58:44.479 --> 58:45.981
You call this success?

58:47.149 --> 58:49.526
Publishing a dirty magazine?
Making fun of the president?

58:49.609 --> 58:52.070
- Okay, Harry.
- What is there to be proud of?

59:01.455 --> 59:03.040
I'm gonna get a gimlet.

59:07.002 --> 59:08.170
- Oh, dear.
- Sorry. Got it.

59:10.255 --> 59:11.548
I'm fine. Let me just...

59:12.758 --> 59:13.842
Oh, I got it.

59:17.512 --> 59:20.015
Okay. I see what I did. I see what I did.

59:20.474 --> 59:21.558
<i>Good evening.</i>

59:21.641 --> 59:22.601
<i>Good evening.</i>

59:25.645 --> 59:27.022
<i>Good evening.</i>

59:27.105 --> 59:29.649
They put O'Donoghue on live TV?

59:30.192 --> 59:32.486
O'Donoghue, Belushi.

59:32.569 --> 59:35.113
They got Gilda, Anne, Chevy.

59:35.197 --> 59:37.824
Those fuckers probably hired
our accountants, too.

59:37.908 --> 59:39.618
<i>- I would like...
- I would like...</i>

59:40.285 --> 59:42.996
<i>- ...to feed your fingertips...
- ...to feed your fingertips...</i>

59:43.080 --> 59:45.165
<i>- ...to the wolverines.
- ...to the Wolverines.</i>

59:45.248 --> 59:46.541
<i>Next.</i>

59:47.209 --> 59:48.126
<i>I'm afraid...</i>

59:48.210 --> 59:49.878
Come on, that's funny.

59:50.921 --> 59:54.091
You know, NBC asked Matty
to do a Lampoon TV show.

59:54.591 --> 59:57.511
Really? That's great!
Are you gonna work on it?

59:57.594 --> 01:00:01.181
They asked him eight months ago.
He said that we were too busy.

01:00:02.891 --> 01:00:05.602
Babe, who cares?
This is on in the middle of the night.

01:00:05.685 --> 01:00:07.187
I care! All right?

01:00:07.270 --> 01:00:09.648
This should've been ours.
It basically is ours.

01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:11.858
You could just be flattered,

01:00:12.359 --> 01:00:14.402
because it shows how influential you are.

01:00:20.784 --> 01:00:22.536
You gonna be okay about this?

01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:23.578
Well...

01:00:24.162 --> 01:00:26.206
tell me again how influential I am.

01:00:26.957 --> 01:00:31.795
You are the most influentialest.

01:00:36.424 --> 01:00:39.886
<i>Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!</i>

01:00:45.392 --> 01:00:48.812
<i>Turns out Saturday Night Live
was canceled after only three weeks.</i>

01:00:48.895 --> 01:00:51.815
<i>Oh, I'm sorry, I meant to say
it was an instant sensation</i>

01:00:51.898 --> 01:00:54.109
<i>that is still going four decades later.</i>

01:00:54.192 --> 01:00:55.235
Hi, Doug.

01:00:55.318 --> 01:00:58.113
<i>So I went to one of their parties
to congratulate my friends</i>

01:00:58.196 --> 01:01:00.532
<i>on the success they were having...
without me.</i>

01:01:00.615 --> 01:01:02.284
Oh, Doug! Hey!

01:01:02.868 --> 01:01:03.702
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:01:04.161 --> 01:01:05.704
- How you doing?
- Hey.

01:01:05.787 --> 01:01:06.997
Look what the cat dragged in.

01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:10.167
Hey, I've been enjoying your little show,
along with the rest of the country.

01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:13.336
<i>Yeah. Yeah, it's fun.
It's like The Lampoon used to be.</i>

01:01:14.629 --> 01:01:17.007
Is. Like, don't listen to me.

01:01:17.090 --> 01:01:19.259
Television, the napalm of culture.

01:01:19.718 --> 01:01:22.387
Burns you down to nothing,
but the glow is awful pretty.

01:01:22.470 --> 01:01:23.722
Okay, so he's just upset

01:01:23.805 --> 01:01:26.516
because Lorne wants us
to write sketches for the Muppets.

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:28.143
I don't write for felt.

01:01:28.727 --> 01:01:30.770
Oh, not you too, Brian.

01:01:30.854 --> 01:01:32.772
They offered me 30 pieces of silver.

01:01:33.356 --> 01:01:34.858
You know how I feel about silver.

01:01:34.941 --> 01:01:37.194
<i>They were like ships
leaving a sinking rat.</i>

01:01:37.277 --> 01:01:38.445
Doug.

01:01:38.528 --> 01:01:39.821
Oh, jeez.

01:01:40.363 --> 01:01:43.116
<i>And yeah, Chevy did this
every time I saw him.</i>

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:44.784
Right. There we are.

01:01:46.036 --> 01:01:47.287
- Hi, Doug.
- Hey, lover.

01:01:47.996 --> 01:01:49.164
You should meet Lorne.

01:01:49.539 --> 01:01:50.916
Oh, the comedy boy-wonder, huh?

01:01:50.999 --> 01:01:54.753
No. Hey, there can be two boy-wonders.
Boys-wonder.

01:01:55.670 --> 01:01:57.005
What do boys wonder? Excuse you.

01:01:57.088 --> 01:02:00.050
<i>Lorne, this is Doug Kenney
from The National Lampoon.</i>

01:02:00.133 --> 01:02:01.760
Hi, Doug. Pleasure to meet you.

01:02:01.843 --> 01:02:04.679
Thanks. I like the show. It's great stuff.

01:02:04.763 --> 01:02:06.890
Right. Well, you know, we do what we can.

01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:10.977
Doug, uh, you get
the kind of comedy we're doing here.

01:02:11.061 --> 01:02:13.730
You and I, you know,
we share a sensibility.

01:02:13.813 --> 01:02:15.941
Yeah, and a cast and writers. Yeah.

01:02:16.024 --> 01:02:18.902
Spotting talent
is the most important job I have.

01:02:18.985 --> 01:02:20.987
- You can understand that.
- Yeah.

01:02:21.071 --> 01:02:23.990
I was wondering,
would you be interested in joining us?

01:02:24.074 --> 01:02:26.201
You want me to write for you?

01:02:26.868 --> 01:02:29.537
That sounds great!
Yeah, I'd get to be your employee?

01:02:29.621 --> 01:02:31.665
Well, that's a fairly narrow way
to put that, Doug.

01:02:31.748 --> 01:02:34.209
- You think I've flamed out.
- That's not what I'm saying at all.

01:02:34.292 --> 01:02:35.293
It sounds like it is.

01:02:35.377 --> 01:02:39.172
What I'm saying is I think you could
make this show even better than it is.

01:02:40.340 --> 01:02:42.092
Okay, well, I don't need a handout.

01:02:43.551 --> 01:02:46.596
Oh, here. You're probably gonna steal it
from me anyway.

01:02:49.182 --> 01:02:51.309
<i>Game show sketch, Name Those Bats.</i>

01:02:51.393 --> 01:02:53.520
Contestants are in a barn,
bats flying at them,

01:02:53.603 --> 01:02:55.146
they have to name the bats.

01:02:55.230 --> 01:02:58.149
<i>I wasn't gonna let
some TV show steal my thunder.</i>

01:02:58.233 --> 01:03:00.026
<i>I had to set my sights higher.</i>

01:03:00.110 --> 01:03:02.028
<i>So Harold and I came up
with the perfect idea</i>

01:03:02.112 --> 01:03:04.906
<i>for the first National Lampoon movie.</i>

01:03:04.990 --> 01:03:07.117
<i>Laser Orgy Girls.</i>

01:03:07.909 --> 01:03:08.743
Huh?

01:03:08.827 --> 01:03:11.538
It's about Charles Manson
in the tenth grade, huh?

01:03:11.621 --> 01:03:14.124
The man's visited by aliens or a UFO,
whatever you want...

01:03:14.207 --> 01:03:15.875
Guys, Manson in high school?

01:03:15.959 --> 01:03:16.876
You're right.

01:03:17.711 --> 01:03:19.546
We'll put him in college. That's funnier.

01:03:19.629 --> 01:03:21.464
No, forget Manson. It's a bad idea.

01:03:21.548 --> 01:03:23.216
So what are you saying, Matty?

01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:24.926
You don't want a movie
about Charles Manson?

01:03:25.010 --> 01:03:26.261
We got one shot for a movie.

01:03:26.344 --> 01:03:29.264
Manson in high school is a parody ad
for the magazine.

01:03:29.347 --> 01:03:31.182
- If it's a rights issue...
- We need a big idea.

01:03:31.266 --> 01:03:33.059
- My uncle's a lawyer.
- A big movie idea.

01:03:33.143 --> 01:03:34.936
We could find a way
to get Manson involved.

01:03:35.020 --> 01:03:37.439
Harold. I think Matty
might actually have a point here.

01:03:40.233 --> 01:03:42.944
- What's the bit we're doing?
- No, this isn't a bit.

01:03:43.028 --> 01:03:45.280
Look, what's the most popular thing
in the magazine?

01:03:45.363 --> 01:03:46.489
- The tits.
- Yes, the tits.

01:03:46.573 --> 01:03:50.035
<i>But also, like, you know,
Night of the Seven Fires.</i>

01:03:50.577 --> 01:03:52.245
<i>Pinto's First Lay.
All the Chris Miller stuff.</i>

01:03:52.329 --> 01:03:53.747
- The fraternity stories.
- Yeah.

01:03:53.830 --> 01:03:58.251
We have a chance to make the great
American college movie here, plus tits.

01:03:59.669 --> 01:04:01.087
Matty, get Chris Miller on the line.

01:04:01.546 --> 01:04:03.298
One second. I like this.

01:04:05.175 --> 01:04:07.469
God damn it. I'm not your secretary!

01:04:08.803 --> 01:04:10.180
<i>Together with Chris Miller,</i>

01:04:10.263 --> 01:04:12.515
<i>we wrote down
every funny college story,</i>

01:04:12.599 --> 01:04:14.601
<i>every crazy character we could think of.</i>

01:04:15.894 --> 01:04:17.520
<i>Then we hooked up with Ivan Reitman,</i>

01:04:17.604 --> 01:04:20.690
<i>a Canadian filmmaker
who'd produced a stage show for us.</i>

01:04:20.774 --> 01:04:24.235
Delta was by far the craziest frat
at Dartmouth.

01:04:24.319 --> 01:04:26.196
They use to call us the "Animal House."

01:04:26.279 --> 01:04:27.572
That's a good title!

01:04:27.655 --> 01:04:28.782
Yeah!

01:04:29.199 --> 01:04:30.700
The craziest frat.

01:04:31.409 --> 01:04:33.536
<i>Brad Zotti from Universal is on.</i>

01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:34.954
- Brad.
- Yeah.

01:04:35.038 --> 01:04:36.790
I got you on speakerphone here with Ivan.

01:04:36.873 --> 01:04:38.124
<i>- Look, guys.
- Hey, Brad.</i>

01:04:38.208 --> 01:04:41.378
Movie treatments are 20 pages long.
This is 114.

01:04:41.461 --> 01:04:42.962
Well, this is their first movie, Brad.

01:04:43.046 --> 01:04:45.632
<i>- I would never make this.
- I'm surprised to hear you say that.</i>

01:04:45.715 --> 01:04:48.051
<i>I mean, you know
the Lampoon brand is hot right now.</i>

01:04:48.134 --> 01:04:50.637
A very strong demographic
with the young people.

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:54.140
Okay, look, I couldn't do this unless
it was, like, for under $2 million.

01:04:54.224 --> 01:04:55.975
<i>- We can do that.
- Really?</i>

01:04:56.643 --> 01:04:57.936
I guarantee it.

01:04:58.019 --> 01:04:59.187
<i>- Okay.
- We got a deal.</i>

01:04:59.270 --> 01:05:00.480
<i>- Great. Bye.
- Thank you, Brad.</i>

01:05:00.563 --> 01:05:02.315
You are not gonna regret this.

01:05:02.399 --> 01:05:03.358
Oh, he hung up.

01:05:03.441 --> 01:05:05.235
<i>So with the studio's ringing endorsement,</i>

01:05:05.318 --> 01:05:08.488
<i>we started shooting in the fall of 1976.</i>

01:05:08.988 --> 01:05:10.698
<i>St. Louis, Missouri.</i>

01:05:13.243 --> 01:05:14.494
Close enough.

01:05:14.828 --> 01:05:17.956
<i>It was a classic tale
of slobs versus snobs.</i>

01:05:18.039 --> 01:05:19.916
<i>The Deltas versus the Omegas.</i>

01:05:19.999 --> 01:05:22.627
<i>We hired an ensemble
of mostly unknown actors.</i>

01:05:22.710 --> 01:05:24.587
<i>There's Tim Matheson
in the orange sweater.</i>

01:05:24.671 --> 01:05:26.464
<i>He's about to say the title of this movie.</i>

01:05:26.548 --> 01:05:28.967
A futile and stupid gesture be done...

01:05:29.050 --> 01:05:30.802
<i>But we also needed a heavy hitter,</i>

01:05:30.885 --> 01:05:33.888
<i>a comic superstar that we knew
could deliver the goods.</i>

01:05:33.972 --> 01:05:36.433
<i>And that's why we brought in this guy.</i>

01:05:36.516 --> 01:05:39.185
"Well, what the hell we supposed to do,
you moron?"

01:05:40.145 --> 01:05:41.771
I just memorized my one line.

01:05:41.855 --> 01:05:43.064
You cannot shoot a scene

01:05:43.148 --> 01:05:46.067
where they leave their dates behind
at a black nightclub!

01:05:46.151 --> 01:05:47.610
I'm not having this discussion.

01:05:47.694 --> 01:05:48.611
- Okay, Doug.
- Chris.

01:05:48.695 --> 01:05:51.406
I can't stand by while someone refuses
to have a discussion.

01:05:51.489 --> 01:05:53.908
- Just calm down, Brad.
- This goes too far.

01:05:53.992 --> 01:05:56.661
You put this in front of an audience,
we'll have race riots.

01:05:56.744 --> 01:05:59.622
- More like laugh riots, am I right?
- Doug, we're handling it.

01:05:59.706 --> 01:06:02.459
- Who the fuck is this?
- Doug Kenney, Chagrin Falls, Ohio.

01:06:02.542 --> 01:06:05.378
- Hey, nice arm. You play tennis?
- Damn right I play tennis.

01:06:05.462 --> 01:06:08.173
- Doug is one of the writers.
- And why is he annoying me?

01:06:08.256 --> 01:06:09.674
I ask myself the same thing.

01:06:09.757 --> 01:06:11.801
Actually, you wouldn't pay
to have writers on set.

01:06:11.885 --> 01:06:13.553
I'm here as an actor. It's a loophole.

01:06:13.636 --> 01:06:17.307
Now, as for this nightclub scene,
hey, it's funny and it's honest.

01:06:17.390 --> 01:06:21.352
And I say this not only as a writer
of the film, but as a black man.

01:06:21.436 --> 01:06:24.647
I'm not risking the studio's reputation
over a college movie!

01:06:24.731 --> 01:06:27.150
Period, end of conversation, no.

01:06:28.401 --> 01:06:29.360
Doug.

01:06:45.168 --> 01:06:46.503
Food fight!

01:06:47.462 --> 01:06:51.424
<i>Needless to say, the studio suits
didn't like us, but fuck 'em.</i>

01:06:51.508 --> 01:06:52.842
<i>We were making a movie.</i>

01:06:55.762 --> 01:06:57.639
<i>Animal House was the culmination</i>

01:06:57.722 --> 01:06:59.849
<i>of everything we had written about
in the magazine.</i>

01:07:00.475 --> 01:07:02.769
<i>It was about power and class,</i>

01:07:02.852 --> 01:07:05.104
<i>the individual versus authority.</i>

01:07:05.563 --> 01:07:09.484
<i>Nostalgia for some innocent time
that never really existed.</i>

01:07:09.567 --> 01:07:12.403
<i>It was subversive. It celebrated chaos.</i>

01:07:12.487 --> 01:07:14.614
<i>It was America in a nutshell.</i>

01:07:14.697 --> 01:07:16.366
<i>Also, tits.</i>

01:07:21.287 --> 01:07:24.707
<i>It shot to the top
of the box office and stayed there,</i>

01:07:24.791 --> 01:07:27.544
<i>becoming the biggest comedy
in movie history.</i>

01:07:27.627 --> 01:07:30.880
<i>Toga. Toga. Toga.</i>

01:07:37.387 --> 01:07:39.722
<i>How did it feel to make a smash hit movie?</i>

01:07:40.306 --> 01:07:41.516
<i>Pretty fucking great.</i>

01:07:42.850 --> 01:07:44.185
<i>There was just one problem.</i>

01:07:44.894 --> 01:07:46.312
<i>Where do you go from there?</i>

01:07:48.898 --> 01:07:50.608
I went for the full fondue set this time.

01:07:50.692 --> 01:07:53.069
Comes with eight forks. It's cast-iron.

01:07:53.152 --> 01:07:55.863
Wow, sounds like
it's all really finally happening for you.

01:07:58.449 --> 01:08:01.411
Doug. You. You, get over here.

01:08:01.494 --> 01:08:02.620
Come here.

01:08:02.704 --> 01:08:04.747
I knew it.
I knew we had something special.

01:08:04.831 --> 01:08:08.126
- I always knew that you would know that.
- The kids were rioting in the aisles.

01:08:08.209 --> 01:08:10.545
- Yeah, at least they weren't race riots.
- Gimme a break.

01:08:10.628 --> 01:08:12.630
You thought I was worried about that?
I wasn't worried about that.

01:08:12.714 --> 01:08:15.925
In fact, we had a screening
for Richard Pryor. He thought it was fine.

01:08:16.009 --> 01:08:17.551
- I mean, that's one cool cat.
- Yeah.

01:08:17.635 --> 01:08:19.136
He's a cool, cool cat.

01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:21.639
- Hey, what are we doing next?
- Well, you're a tool.

01:08:21.723 --> 01:08:22.599
Great title!

01:08:22.682 --> 01:08:24.183
Write it up. That's funny.

01:08:26.435 --> 01:08:28.313
Oh, it's nothing but a college movie.

01:08:31.316 --> 01:08:34.444
They couldn't ask me for a rewrite?
A couple of jokes?

01:08:35.069 --> 01:08:36.654
Did I tell you
how much I loved your movie?

01:08:36.738 --> 01:08:38.323
Oh, the movie's not important.

01:08:38.406 --> 01:08:40.073
What's important is you...

01:08:40.158 --> 01:08:41.658
and how much you loved my movie.

01:08:41.743 --> 01:08:45.371
Okay, now, listen. I made
a big decision in the last 40 seconds.

01:08:45.455 --> 01:08:47.624
I feel very strongly about it.

01:08:47.707 --> 01:08:49.709
You are gonna come live with me in LA.

01:08:49.792 --> 01:08:51.461
You want to move to Los Angeles?

01:08:51.544 --> 01:08:55.340
No, no, no, LA. You know, Louisiana.
They got gator on a stick down there.

01:08:55.423 --> 01:08:58.551
- Think about it. A stick!
- There he is! You crazy son of a bitch.

01:08:59.551 --> 01:09:05.390
Listen, Matty. I wanted to tell you first.
I think it's time to move to Hollywood.

01:09:05.475 --> 01:09:08.394
We are thinking alike.
I'm gonna open an office in Beverly Hills.

01:09:08.478 --> 01:09:09.354
We are gonna hit it.

01:09:09.437 --> 01:09:14.442
<i>No. No, I'm leaving National Lampoon...
for good this time.</i>

01:09:14.524 --> 01:09:18.154
Whoa. We got a hit movie. Okay?
Now is not the time to leave.

01:09:18.237 --> 01:09:19.822
Now's the time to make more.

01:09:19.906 --> 01:09:22.992
You'll make other movies.
They just won't involve me.

01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:25.286
What about the magazine?

01:09:25.745 --> 01:09:27.412
Weight Watchers will be fine without me.

01:09:27.497 --> 01:09:29.415
- What about our magazine?
- I know, I'm sorry.

01:09:29.499 --> 01:09:32.126
Come on! You need me, Doug!
You need me!

01:09:32.210 --> 01:09:33.544
I do! I do! You're wonderful.

01:10:01.114 --> 01:10:02.907
All right, what do you say, kid?

01:10:02.990 --> 01:10:04.409
Let's make a picture, huh?

01:10:05.576 --> 01:10:10.039
Himalayan Zen Buddhists
who can down airplanes with their minds?

01:10:10.123 --> 01:10:12.250
You can't tell me
that's not a movie you wouldn't see.

01:10:12.333 --> 01:10:14.335
- That's a lot of negatives.
- I don't disagree.

01:10:14.419 --> 01:10:17.588
Okay. Well, we could also talk
about the prep school script,

01:10:17.672 --> 01:10:20.675
or the treatment from Jules Feiffer,

01:10:20.758 --> 01:10:23.219
or the, you know,
Chris's thing about the resort.

01:10:23.302 --> 01:10:26.639
I've got some work we should get to first.

01:10:27.348 --> 01:10:29.142
Here, let me just move these.

01:10:38.860 --> 01:10:39.944
If I must.

01:11:00.590 --> 01:11:02.508
Hey, Mom! Hey!

01:11:04.135 --> 01:11:07.096
Yeah. No, no, no. Kathryn's out of town.
She's shooting a movie.

01:11:07.722 --> 01:11:11.684
Uh... Yeah. Hey, so, listen,
did they finish building the pool?

01:11:13.603 --> 01:11:16.773
Does Dad like it? Like, is it big enough?

01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:21.444
Like, you know, I made sure
they were gonna do it nice and big.

01:11:23.112 --> 01:11:26.032
Has he, like, been out there yet?
Is that...

01:11:28.201 --> 01:11:30.036
Oh, no, no, no.

01:11:30.453 --> 01:11:31.829
Oh, uh...

01:11:31.913 --> 01:11:33.831
Yeah. No, no, no, tomorrow's fine.

01:11:33.915 --> 01:11:36.876
No, no, no. I mean... Well... uh...

01:11:36.959 --> 01:11:38.127
Mom. Mom. Mom.

01:11:46.761 --> 01:11:48.888
Hey, Doug, I got your notes.

01:11:48.971 --> 01:11:51.557
Also it kind of feels like
you didn't really read the whole script.

01:11:52.892 --> 01:11:53.768
Doug.

01:11:55.603 --> 01:11:56.521
Hey.

01:11:57.271 --> 01:11:59.565
Hey, you want to see
what $2,000 of cocaine looks like?

01:11:59.649 --> 01:12:01.442
No, I really want
to talk about the script.

01:12:01.526 --> 01:12:03.528
Wow, that's a lot of cocaine.

01:12:03.611 --> 01:12:05.488
Got to spend my money on something.

01:12:06.572 --> 01:12:07.657
Gotta go.

01:12:08.366 --> 01:12:10.493
Are we really not gonna talk
about the script?

01:12:10.576 --> 01:12:12.411
Always go with your worst instincts.

01:12:26.884 --> 01:12:28.845
Have you ever seen a person
make their hand disappear?

01:12:28.928 --> 01:12:30.012
Mm-hmm.

01:12:30.096 --> 01:12:31.222
All right.

01:12:32.056 --> 01:12:34.267
Whoa!

01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:35.810
Wow, don't choke on that.

01:12:36.644 --> 01:12:37.687
Kathryn!

01:12:38.354 --> 01:12:40.273
I waited at the airport for two hours.

01:12:40.773 --> 01:12:42.608
Oh, shit. I thought that was tomorrow.

01:12:42.692 --> 01:12:44.402
Oh, that's all right.

01:12:44.485 --> 01:12:46.904
You were busy planning this, uh...

01:12:47.363 --> 01:12:48.531
A welcome home party?

01:12:49.156 --> 01:12:50.449
Exactly!

01:12:50.533 --> 01:12:53.911
Here, let me introduce you
to my new friends. This is Missy?

01:12:53.995 --> 01:12:55.413
If you want it to be.

01:12:56.706 --> 01:12:57.540
It's Missy.

01:12:59.542 --> 01:13:00.960
See you later, Missy.

01:13:05.590 --> 01:13:07.508
Can you explain to me what is going on?

01:13:07.592 --> 01:13:09.760
'Cause I haven't been able
to reach you all week.

01:13:09.844 --> 01:13:12.763
What? You know, I'm busy.
I'm Hollywood's It Girl.

01:13:12.847 --> 01:13:16.017
- That's hilarious.
- It's... Thank you.

01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:20.187
This is a check for a $186,000.

01:13:20.271 --> 01:13:22.398
Oh, I was wondering
what happened to that.

01:13:22.481 --> 01:13:23.399
That's great.

01:13:23.482 --> 01:13:26.485
Good to find 186K, you know?

01:13:26.569 --> 01:13:28.863
Put that right there in the check zone.
Right there.

01:13:28.946 --> 01:13:30.656
Oh, look at this. Have you seen this?

01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:32.992
Super weird. I would've thought
that Dwight D. Eisenhower

01:13:33.075 --> 01:13:36.037
would have had like brains in his head,
but no, it's just all cocaine.

01:13:37.163 --> 01:13:39.165
Oh, come on!

01:13:39.248 --> 01:13:40.458
Come on.

01:13:40.541 --> 01:13:45.087
Okay, you're very clearly upset
that I'm having a party, is that it?

01:13:45.546 --> 01:13:48.257
- I'll tell them all to leave.
- No, we're talking right now.

01:13:48.341 --> 01:13:51.093
- No, I'm gonna tell them to leave.
- No, we're talking right now!

01:14:00.645 --> 01:14:01.979
You need to see someone.

01:14:02.563 --> 01:14:04.440
Oh, a shrink?

01:14:04.523 --> 01:14:06.984
Oh, if I can tell him
all about how little Dougie

01:14:07.068 --> 01:14:08.819
needs to be the center of attention?

01:14:08.903 --> 01:14:10.988
No. I just need to write another movie

01:14:11.072 --> 01:14:13.658
so I can be the center of attention.

01:14:18.579 --> 01:14:20.039
You're going to work right now?

01:14:20.122 --> 01:14:24.210
There's a force in the universe
that makes things happen.

01:14:26.045 --> 01:14:26.879
What?

01:14:26.963 --> 01:14:30.216
"Be the ball, Danny.

01:14:31.050 --> 01:14:33.511
Be the ball."

01:14:43.187 --> 01:14:44.689
In one model of the universe,

01:14:44.772 --> 01:14:47.942
the shortest distance between two points
is a straight line...

01:14:49.151 --> 01:14:50.653
in the opposite direction, Danny.

01:14:51.070 --> 01:14:53.322
- Unbelievable.
- Thank you very little.

01:14:53.698 --> 01:14:54.991
And... cut!

01:14:56.075 --> 01:14:59.453
That's 48 takes.
Maybe we should move on?

01:14:59.537 --> 01:15:00.746
Couple more.

01:15:00.830 --> 01:15:02.832
Chevy, let's go again.

01:15:03.582 --> 01:15:04.709
Excuse you.

01:15:04.792 --> 01:15:07.003
Harold's never directed.
Doug's never produced.

01:15:07.086 --> 01:15:08.713
Rodney's never acted.

01:15:08.796 --> 01:15:10.089
What could possibly go wrong?

01:15:11.090 --> 01:15:14.885
<i>Sure, it was a comedy about golf,
but Caddyshack was personal.</i>

01:15:14.969 --> 01:15:18.973
<i>A chance to get back at all the snobs
and idiots my dad worked for</i>

01:15:19.056 --> 01:15:21.642
<i>using some
of America's finest comic actors.</i>

01:15:22.184 --> 01:15:24.270
And... action!

01:15:25.938 --> 01:15:29.442
Rodney, when I call action,
you need to start the scene.

01:15:30.026 --> 01:15:31.902
- Okay, fine.
- All right.

01:15:32.570 --> 01:15:33.529
Action!

01:15:34.697 --> 01:15:36.782
Hi, is this your first movie, too?

01:15:36.866 --> 01:15:39.660
<i>- I told my wife I was gonna be in a movie.
- No pressure, right?</i>

01:15:39.744 --> 01:15:42.580
<i>All I had to do was top Animal House</i>

01:15:42.663 --> 01:15:44.957
and make the next biggest comedy
of all time.

01:15:46.625 --> 01:15:48.377
Oh, farts!

01:15:48.878 --> 01:15:51.005
<i>It takes a lot of energy
to make a hit movie.</i>

01:15:51.088 --> 01:15:54.592
<i>Thankfully, to keep us going,
we had energy powder.</i>

01:16:00.139 --> 01:16:02.641
Taking heavy fire!

01:16:03.059 --> 01:16:05.603
You'll never catch me!

01:16:06.270 --> 01:16:08.064
- Mayday! Mayday!
- Whoo!

01:16:08.147 --> 01:16:09.565
We're taking fire!

01:16:09.648 --> 01:16:10.941
Hey, hold on.

01:16:11.025 --> 01:16:12.902
Whoa! Ha ha!

01:16:20.117 --> 01:16:21.577
Hey, buddy, how are you?

01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:26.082
The handsomest man in comedy.
Some call him the king of nostalgia.

01:16:29.835 --> 01:16:31.921
He lives his life close to the edge.

01:16:32.004 --> 01:16:36.342
He once wrote a novel
and threw it in the trash. Who does that?

01:16:36.425 --> 01:16:41.305
Doug Kenney! And here to tell Doug
just how proud he is,

01:16:41.388 --> 01:16:44.517
fresh from teaching tennis
at the Chagrin Falls Country Club,

01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:46.185
this guy's sharper than a dentist's drill.

01:16:46.268 --> 01:16:49.396
Harry Kenney, what do you got to say,
soul brother?

01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:53.901
Son, you're a lefty weirdo.
Huge disappointment.

01:16:55.736 --> 01:16:58.114
Uh-oh, sounds bad.

01:16:58.197 --> 01:16:59.365
You heard it here first.

01:16:59.448 --> 01:17:02.660
He did not like his son.
The wrong one died.

01:17:02.743 --> 01:17:03.744
Bummer-ski.

01:17:03.828 --> 01:17:05.621
Painful, baby, painful.

01:17:05.704 --> 01:17:07.540
Oh, is that... Could it be?

01:17:07.623 --> 01:17:10.126
Live from New York, it's Henry Beard!

01:17:12.086 --> 01:17:14.338
We had a fine run, you and I.

01:17:14.421 --> 01:17:19.426
Oh, no. I bet you wish you still had
Beardy around to pick up the slack,

01:17:19.510 --> 01:17:21.095
but you drove him out of your life,

01:17:21.178 --> 01:17:24.682
just like you drove away Alex
and will most likely drive away Kathryn.

01:17:24.765 --> 01:17:26.308
Sensing a pattern.

01:17:26.392 --> 01:17:28.227
It's not a pattern.

01:17:32.815 --> 01:17:34.066
You need to decide, Doug.

01:17:35.442 --> 01:17:36.610
Doug!

01:17:38.028 --> 01:17:41.490
Doug! We need to decide, is it clear
he's jerking his dick off here?

01:17:41.574 --> 01:17:44.827
Yeah, we could make it higher or lower,
depending on the size of my dong.

01:17:46.078 --> 01:17:48.414
We can get rid of these two scenes
and move this down,

01:17:48.497 --> 01:17:52.293
but then we need a transition,
which we did not shoot.

01:17:53.961 --> 01:17:56.130
We watched your first cut,
all four hours of it.

01:17:56.213 --> 01:17:57.590
Hi, Brad. How are you?

01:17:57.673 --> 01:18:00.843
You know, I'm a friend of comedy.
You guys know that. Okay?

01:18:00.926 --> 01:18:04.763
But you are over budget, over schedule.
This is not how we make movies here.

01:18:04.847 --> 01:18:08.017
Brad. Brad, you better come back
with a different attitude

01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:09.268
or don't come back at all.

01:18:09.351 --> 01:18:12.313
- Excuse me?
- The fuck is that doing here?

01:18:12.396 --> 01:18:15.024
That is the star of this movie, okay?

01:18:15.107 --> 01:18:17.067
I want more scenes with this little guy.

01:18:17.151 --> 01:18:18.235
That's not what we talked about.

01:18:18.319 --> 01:18:21.197
<i>I hired a guy from Star Wars
to build this. People are gonna love this.</i>

01:18:23.699 --> 01:18:25.492
This isn't a fucking kid's movie.

01:18:25.576 --> 01:18:28.204
I paid for this gopher,
and he's gonna go in my picture.

01:18:28.287 --> 01:18:29.455
Oh, "your" picture?

01:18:29.538 --> 01:18:32.333
Kenney, this isn't your little magazine.
I'm in charge.

01:18:32.416 --> 01:18:35.169
Is that what you told your wife
when you caught her fucking Peter Falk?

01:18:36.879 --> 01:18:38.005
That's just a rumor.

01:18:38.088 --> 01:18:41.717
Is his cock all squinty, too? Huh?

01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:42.885
Oh, I'm gonna come!

01:18:45.095 --> 01:18:47.890
<i>How many of you have seen
National Lampoon's Animal House?</i>

01:18:49.391 --> 01:18:51.936
Okay. Well, inside that bungalow
to your right,

01:18:52.019 --> 01:18:55.439
<i>some of the creators of Animal House
are working on their next movie.</i>

01:18:55.522 --> 01:18:57.608
And I'm sure it's gonna be just as crazy...

01:18:59.944 --> 01:19:00.945
Get off my lot!

01:19:01.028 --> 01:19:02.905
- Doug!
- You're crazy!

01:19:05.032 --> 01:19:06.659
Get off!

01:19:07.243 --> 01:19:08.911
- Cool!
- Ah!

01:19:11.372 --> 01:19:12.206
Okay.

01:19:15.125 --> 01:19:16.335
<i>I threw a few punches,</i>

01:19:16.418 --> 01:19:18.629
<i>and the studio sidelined me
from my own movie.</i>

01:19:18.712 --> 01:19:20.547
<i>So much for Hollywood glamour.</i>

01:19:21.674 --> 01:19:23.592
<i>And from there, things got worse.</i>

01:19:23.676 --> 01:19:26.971
<i>I had an experience
that shook me to my very core.</i>

01:19:27.054 --> 01:19:28.264
<i>I saw this.</i>

01:19:28.806 --> 01:19:30.683
<i>Can you fly this plane and land it?</i>

01:19:31.767 --> 01:19:33.143
<i>Surely you can't be serious.</i>

01:19:33.227 --> 01:19:34.603
<i>I am serious.</i>

01:19:34.687 --> 01:19:35.980
<i>And don't call me Shirley.</i>

01:19:39.149 --> 01:19:40.609
<i>Mr. Striker's the only one.</i>

01:19:45.239 --> 01:19:46.490
What's the matter?

01:19:46.573 --> 01:19:48.284
Nothing. Everything's great.

01:19:48.784 --> 01:19:51.370
Surely you're not upset because
someone else made a funny movie.

01:19:51.453 --> 01:19:52.788
Don't you get it?

01:19:52.871 --> 01:19:54.790
That's the movie
that everyone's gonna love,

01:19:54.873 --> 01:19:56.875
<i>not fucking Caddyshack.</i>

01:19:56.959 --> 01:19:58.127
I've been replaced.

01:19:59.670 --> 01:20:01.547
What the fuck am I gonna do now?

01:20:02.089 --> 01:20:04.341
You're supposed to say,
"Don't call me Shirley."

01:20:08.304 --> 01:20:10.306
<i>Um, hi, it's Doug.</i>

01:20:10.389 --> 01:20:12.141
<i>I'm gonna be in town for a couple days.</i>

01:20:12.224 --> 01:20:16.770
<i>I'd love to see you for,
I don't know, a drink?</i>

01:20:16.854 --> 01:20:18.022
<i>Maybe a beverage?</i>

01:20:19.023 --> 01:20:22.359
<i>You know? I was right the first time.
Let's make it a drink.</i>

01:20:31.785 --> 01:20:32.995
Hey!

01:20:33.454 --> 01:20:35.622
Look at you!

01:20:37.291 --> 01:20:39.209
You look great. You join a cult?

01:20:39.710 --> 01:20:42.338
- I'm actually between cults right now.
- Oh, okay. Okay.

01:20:42.421 --> 01:20:43.339
A beer?

01:20:50.596 --> 01:20:51.513
Thank you.

01:20:53.098 --> 01:20:54.266
You here for the movie?

01:20:55.768 --> 01:20:57.353
Uh, yeah.

01:20:58.562 --> 01:21:00.898
I have this press thing I got to do.

01:21:00.981 --> 01:21:05.736
Oh, I can't wait for everyone to see
the big fucking gopher extravaganza.

01:21:07.029 --> 01:21:08.113
Proud day.

01:21:09.031 --> 01:21:09.907
Thank you.

01:21:11.033 --> 01:21:12.076
You all right?

01:21:12.159 --> 01:21:14.036
I'm fine. I'm fine.

01:21:14.703 --> 01:21:16.830
I'm better than the fucking movie.

01:21:16.914 --> 01:21:18.916
- I'm sure it's great.
- Ah.

01:21:18.999 --> 01:21:22.836
You wrote the most successful comedy
movie of all time on your first try. So...

01:21:23.462 --> 01:21:25.381
Yeah, that was two years ago.

01:21:31.345 --> 01:21:34.056
So how about you? You still writing?

01:21:34.890 --> 01:21:35.808
Uh...

01:21:35.891 --> 01:21:36.725
Yeah.

01:21:36.809 --> 01:21:37.976
Mm-hmm.

01:21:38.685 --> 01:21:41.980
Little bit. I got a couple book ideas.

01:21:42.940 --> 01:21:44.274
How about a movie? Huh?

01:21:45.234 --> 01:21:48.904
I mean, we could write one together.

01:21:49.863 --> 01:21:53.033
- I don't know, you're the movie guy now.
- Oh, no, no, no.

01:21:53.117 --> 01:21:55.035
Why don't you just come out
and stay with me?

01:21:55.119 --> 01:21:57.788
And we can, you know,
throw around some ideas.

01:21:58.956 --> 01:22:01.375
We're not really LA people.

01:22:02.167 --> 01:22:04.294
Of course we are.
What are you talking about?

01:22:04.378 --> 01:22:05.504
It's beautiful.

01:22:06.630 --> 01:22:08.715
There's the palm trees.

01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:16.765
Oh.

01:22:16.849 --> 01:22:19.435
You weren't talking about us. Okay.

01:22:19.518 --> 01:22:20.853
I meant a lady.

01:22:21.478 --> 01:22:23.397
- A woman.
- Oh, my God, no.

01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:25.732
- Henry Beard has a girlfriend.
- Yep.

01:22:25.816 --> 01:22:28.360
- Henry Beard!
- You would like her.

01:22:28.444 --> 01:22:31.530
She knows a lot about atomic energy. So...

01:22:31.613 --> 01:22:33.198
- So sexy.
- Mm-hmm.

01:22:33.282 --> 01:22:35.284
Yeah, well, why don't you both come stay?

01:22:36.201 --> 01:22:37.578
Both of you come out.

01:22:37.661 --> 01:22:40.122
Now's not a good time.
We're getting the house renovated,

01:22:40.205 --> 01:22:42.833
and her daughter's in day camp.

01:22:42.916 --> 01:22:44.334
Her daughter?

01:22:45.210 --> 01:22:47.045
You have, like, a family.

01:22:47.629 --> 01:22:50.632
You're an adult.

01:22:50.716 --> 01:22:54.136
Oh, God. That must be a lot.

01:22:55.095 --> 01:22:57.556
It's actually easier
than running a magazine.

01:22:59.224 --> 01:23:01.894
Yeah, I guess so.

01:23:06.398 --> 01:23:09.693
- I'm so... I'm... I'd pick those up...
- No, don't worry about it. It's all right.

01:23:09.776 --> 01:23:11.445
- Don't worry about it.
- What time's your...

01:23:12.237 --> 01:23:13.572
What time's your press thing?

01:23:17.075 --> 01:23:19.328
- I'm fine, okay?
- I know.

01:23:19.411 --> 01:23:20.704
I see what you're, uh...

01:23:20.787 --> 01:23:25.417
No, I don't need you
to take care of me, okay?

01:23:25.501 --> 01:23:29.338
Now he wants to take care of me. Yeah.

01:23:32.508 --> 01:23:34.092
I do care about you, Doug.

01:23:38.388 --> 01:23:39.389
Well...

01:23:39.932 --> 01:23:41.016
too late.

01:23:43.060 --> 01:23:45.604
You know what?
I'm happy that you reached out.

01:23:47.314 --> 01:23:51.527
Yeah. Well, maybe I shouldn't have.
I don't know how this feels.

01:23:51.610 --> 01:23:54.196
- What are you talking about?
- I... I should go.

01:23:54.863 --> 01:23:56.490
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:23:57.199 --> 01:24:00.202
Doug, you can call me anytime.

01:24:02.621 --> 01:24:04.706
Thank you. Yeah, I will.

01:24:06.291 --> 01:24:07.417
- I'm gonna take this.
- Hey!

01:24:07.918 --> 01:24:09.628
It's all right. I got it.

01:24:09.711 --> 01:24:12.297
- Should we call you a cab?
- I'm a cab.

01:24:14.132 --> 01:24:15.551
He called himself a cab.

01:24:22.266 --> 01:24:23.392
All right, folks.

01:24:23.475 --> 01:24:27.896
<i>Get your questions ready
for the cast and crew of Caddyshack.</i>

01:24:31.275 --> 01:24:34.152
Okay, yeah.
Okay, I think we're gonna get started.

01:24:35.362 --> 01:24:38.282
You've all seen the movie.
It's great, isn't it?

01:24:38.865 --> 01:24:40.742
Yeah, it's a funny movie.

01:24:41.618 --> 01:24:42.578
Really funny movie.

01:24:42.661 --> 01:24:45.080
Oh, it sucked!

01:24:45.706 --> 01:24:47.374
Didn't everybody think it was terrible?

01:24:47.457 --> 01:24:50.836
Okay, this is... Everyone, this is
the hilarious Doug Kenney, our writer.

01:24:50.919 --> 01:24:52.337
Douglas Kenney, everyone.

01:24:53.171 --> 01:24:54.631
Okay, he's joking.

01:24:54.715 --> 01:24:56.091
I'm not joking.

01:24:56.174 --> 01:24:58.260
Fuck this fucking movie.

01:24:58.343 --> 01:24:59.177
Fuck the gopher.

01:24:59.261 --> 01:25:02.264
There was a mechanical gopher.
It's not even a real gopher.

01:25:02.764 --> 01:25:04.725
It's a piece of shit.

01:25:04.808 --> 01:25:08.061
I don't know, I think this guy's
a couple sandwiches short of a picnic.

01:25:09.062 --> 01:25:11.607
That's the kind of shit
that's in the movie!

01:25:11.690 --> 01:25:13.025
Hey.

01:25:13.108 --> 01:25:14.985
You guys, come on.
What are you doing up there?

01:25:15.068 --> 01:25:17.321
Are you talking about
what a piece of shit it is?

01:25:17.404 --> 01:25:19.323
- Honey, let's go.
- Is that... No, no, no.

01:25:19.406 --> 01:25:23.410
I know I'm saying what a piece of shit
it is a bunch, but I'm very proud of it.

01:25:23.493 --> 01:25:25.829
This... 'Cause I... It's like my baby.

01:25:25.912 --> 01:25:29.791
It's like a shit baby
that I laid out there.

01:25:29.875 --> 01:25:32.419
And I'm really proud of it.
And I know we all are.

01:25:32.502 --> 01:25:35.547
Doug! That's enough.

01:25:36.882 --> 01:25:38.258
What are you guys doing here?

01:25:38.342 --> 01:25:41.470
- You tell us.
- Doug, you begged us to come.

01:25:42.971 --> 01:25:43.889
I did?

01:25:48.268 --> 01:25:51.480
Well, I guess
you were right all along, huh?

01:25:52.022 --> 01:25:54.524
It's just big fucking waste of time.

01:25:56.652 --> 01:25:58.737
I'm a fucking piece of shit.

01:25:59.988 --> 01:26:01.323
Oh!

01:26:01.406 --> 01:26:02.532
Okay. Hey. Hey.

01:26:02.616 --> 01:26:04.576
Get him the hell out of here, please.

01:26:06.912 --> 01:26:09.039
Okay, sorry, everybody.

01:26:09.122 --> 01:26:11.249
Yeah, well, just... Let's...

01:26:11.333 --> 01:26:14.169
Buddy, why don't we go
get some rest somewhere?

01:26:15.379 --> 01:26:18.006
We should work together again, huh?

01:26:29.101 --> 01:26:29.935
Blowjob!

01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:31.561
Cocksucker!

01:26:32.270 --> 01:26:33.230
Rim licker!

01:26:33.313 --> 01:26:34.481
Cum-on-my-face!

01:26:34.564 --> 01:26:35.565
Swollen balls!

01:26:35.649 --> 01:26:37.317
- Balls-on-my-face!
- Ronald Reagan!

01:26:38.026 --> 01:26:39.152
Chevy!

01:26:43.490 --> 01:26:44.533
What's today?

01:26:46.201 --> 01:26:48.870
Well, it's Russian solstice, so...

01:26:51.873 --> 01:26:52.874
Six.

01:26:53.291 --> 01:26:55.127
No. It's a two.

01:26:55.210 --> 01:26:56.211
Hmm.

01:26:57.504 --> 01:26:58.547
I... I...

01:26:58.630 --> 01:27:01.133
Dinah Shore is... No.

01:27:02.926 --> 01:27:04.636
Oh, I got it. Doug...

01:27:06.763 --> 01:27:07.806
It's Thursday.

01:27:10.183 --> 01:27:12.352
- That's six days clean.
- Feels good.

01:27:12.436 --> 01:27:13.854
It feels great.

01:27:14.563 --> 01:27:16.314
I haven't felt this healthy in years.

01:27:16.398 --> 01:27:17.941
I feel like myself again.

01:27:23.947 --> 01:27:25.365
- You think we should...
- I'll call my guy.

01:27:34.374 --> 01:27:36.501
We'll just have the one ball, right?

01:27:37.085 --> 01:27:37.919
One ball.

01:27:42.132 --> 01:27:44.718
- You're the handsomest man in comedy.
- Second handsomest.

01:27:44.801 --> 01:27:48.430
...96, 97, 98, 99, 93, 94, 95, 96...

01:27:49.097 --> 01:27:50.515
- Am I bothering you?
- No.

01:27:52.350 --> 01:27:53.393
93, 94, 95...

01:27:53.477 --> 01:27:55.312
182, 83, 84, 85.

01:27:57.564 --> 01:27:58.398
You win.

01:27:58.482 --> 01:28:02.319
"Caddyshack never finds
a consistent comic note of its own,

01:28:02.402 --> 01:28:05.739
but it plays host
to all sorts of approaches from its stars,

01:28:06.364 --> 01:28:09.618
who sometimes hardly seem
to be occupying the same movie."

01:28:10.076 --> 01:28:13.413
I just think it's weird the Pope
is weighing in on this at all.

01:28:13.497 --> 01:28:14.539
You know?

01:28:18.293 --> 01:28:20.796
Oh, that was so rude of me.
I never even offered you any nuts.

01:28:23.423 --> 01:28:25.634
So what else did the Pope have to say?

01:28:26.593 --> 01:28:28.053
Anything worth note?

01:28:29.304 --> 01:28:30.347
Doug?

01:28:35.310 --> 01:28:36.937
- Hey! Babe.
- Hi.

01:28:37.020 --> 01:28:39.648
- What's up, babe? Hey, hey, hey.
- Hi.

01:28:39.731 --> 01:28:40.690
Mmm.

01:28:40.774 --> 01:28:41.608
- Oh.
- Hi.

01:28:43.235 --> 01:28:45.320
Wait, where's, uh... Chevy?

01:28:46.321 --> 01:28:48.031
I thought he left last night.

01:28:49.199 --> 01:28:52.661
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, last night. Of course. Yeah.

01:28:52.744 --> 01:28:53.578
Oh, hey.

01:28:53.662 --> 01:28:57.374
God, look at this place.
He forgot to... Chevy forgot to...

01:28:57.457 --> 01:29:02.921
I asked him to, like, vacuum and stuff,
and he obviously did not vacuum.

01:29:03.004 --> 01:29:05.006
He forgot to do it,
so let me clean up a little.

01:29:05.090 --> 01:29:07.050
There. There we go.

01:29:07.133 --> 01:29:10.762
And then let's...
You know, let's go, snorkeling. Right?

01:29:10.846 --> 01:29:12.430
Oh, it's good to see you.

01:29:14.933 --> 01:29:19.521
Once the new house is furnished,
I thought maybe we could throw a party.

01:29:20.105 --> 01:29:21.815
Maybe over Labor Day.

01:29:22.941 --> 01:29:25.902
- You'll be back home by then.
- Yeah, of course.

01:29:26.278 --> 01:29:27.445
I think so.

01:29:29.281 --> 01:29:30.198
Doug.

01:29:32.576 --> 01:29:33.869
You need to decide.

01:29:36.621 --> 01:29:37.956
On the furniture?

01:29:38.039 --> 01:29:40.625
Don't make me choose
between Pennsylvania Dutch and Colonial.

01:29:40.709 --> 01:29:41.710
- You know I'm torn.
- Doug.

01:29:41.793 --> 01:29:44.254
You need to decide
if you're serious about getting better.

01:29:44.337 --> 01:29:46.673
You can't just stay here forever.

01:29:47.507 --> 01:29:51.219
It's a tropical paradise. I mean,
the coconuts literally grow on trees here.

01:29:51.303 --> 01:29:52.220
Stop.

01:29:55.765 --> 01:29:57.183
- You don't understand.
- Tell me.

01:29:57.267 --> 01:29:58.810
What don't I understand? Tell me.

01:29:59.352 --> 01:30:00.395
Well, I'm...

01:30:01.271 --> 01:30:04.983
I'm not good at, you know, this.

01:30:05.483 --> 01:30:07.068
- What is this?
- This.

01:30:07.152 --> 01:30:10.155
You know. This. Relationships.

01:30:10.238 --> 01:30:12.490
You know, talking about my feelings.

01:30:12.574 --> 01:30:14.743
You want me to come back.
I want to come back.

01:30:14.826 --> 01:30:16.578
I can't come back a failure.

01:30:17.704 --> 01:30:19.831
In what world are you a failure?

01:30:22.292 --> 01:30:24.127
You need to get it together, okay?

01:30:24.836 --> 01:30:26.588
Definitely. Yes. Yes.

01:30:29.591 --> 01:30:33.261
If you can't have a real conversation
with me, you got to talk to someone.

01:30:34.346 --> 01:30:36.181
Yeah, well, who would I talk to?

01:30:37.098 --> 01:30:38.850
I don't know. Can you call Henry?

01:30:42.395 --> 01:30:43.855
Just call him, okay?

01:31:27.774 --> 01:31:29.025
Beautiful day today.

01:31:29.109 --> 01:31:30.402
- Yeah.
- You going surfing?

01:31:30.985 --> 01:31:33.363
I was thinking about going hiking,
actually.

01:31:33.446 --> 01:31:35.657
Sounds nice. Where are you from?

01:31:38.535 --> 01:31:40.245
Chagrin Falls, Ohio.

01:32:16.489 --> 01:32:18.158
No, I'll pass.

01:32:18.241 --> 01:32:22.120
Isn't downhill skiing just a competition
to see who can get to the hospital first?

01:32:26.374 --> 01:32:27.375
Excuse me.

01:32:27.876 --> 01:32:29.335
Henry's more of a sailor.

01:32:29.419 --> 01:32:32.255
He's gonna take my daughter
on his boat for her sixth birthday.

01:32:32.338 --> 01:32:33.506
Right, Henry?

01:32:33.590 --> 01:32:34.674
It's tempting.

01:32:58.656 --> 01:33:00.325
No, he fell.

01:33:00.408 --> 01:33:02.285
- I was with him two days before.
- Right.

01:33:02.368 --> 01:33:04.913
- That's not the state he was in.
- Well, I think he jumped.

01:33:04.996 --> 01:33:08.958
No, he got high, and he went too far
like he always does, and he fell.

01:33:09.042 --> 01:33:12.170
He probably fell while he was looking
for a place to jump.

01:33:18.218 --> 01:33:19.177
Hi.

01:33:20.762 --> 01:33:22.222
Well, he's in heaven now,

01:33:22.305 --> 01:33:24.766
sticking his dick
in Eleanor Roosevelt's ear.

01:33:25.350 --> 01:33:27.060
He was just so young.

01:33:27.143 --> 01:33:28.394
Can't believe he's gone.

01:33:30.814 --> 01:33:33.483
How can you eat shrimp
at a time like this?

01:33:35.485 --> 01:33:36.444
Yeah.

01:33:37.195 --> 01:33:39.197
We gave them our golden boy,

01:33:40.198 --> 01:33:41.741
and they sent back his body.

01:33:42.158 --> 01:33:44.494
You know, the saddest part
of this whole thing

01:33:46.287 --> 01:33:49.791
is that he wasn't holding hands
with Chevy when he went off that cliff.

01:33:50.542 --> 01:33:53.461
He was like a son to me. I loved him.
Although, sometimes I wanted...

01:33:53.545 --> 01:33:55.505
- to cut the brakes on his car.
- Mm-hmm.

01:33:55.588 --> 01:33:56.923
You know, without telling him.

01:33:57.465 --> 01:34:00.885
A boxing phenomenon who desperately wants
to work at a brassiere factory.

01:34:01.553 --> 01:34:02.887
This is a movie idea?

01:34:04.681 --> 01:34:05.598
Yes.

01:34:06.182 --> 01:34:07.892
He was one of the nicest guys.

01:34:13.356 --> 01:34:14.190
Nice suit.

01:34:16.067 --> 01:34:17.777
- You can see me?
- Mm-hmm.

01:34:17.861 --> 01:34:19.153
I'm the older you.

01:34:19.654 --> 01:34:21.531
If you didn't... you know.

01:34:21.614 --> 01:34:22.866
So you're...

01:34:22.949 --> 01:34:25.410
Yeah. A narrative device.

01:34:25.493 --> 01:34:27.036
- It's a choice. Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

01:34:28.705 --> 01:34:29.831
Wow, look at this.

01:34:31.082 --> 01:34:33.751
You were beloved
by so many white people.

01:34:37.338 --> 01:34:42.176
<i>If it's any consolation, years from now
people really like Caddyshack.</i>

01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:44.762
They're kind of annoying about it,
actually.

01:34:51.644 --> 01:34:53.146
Go ahead. Talk to 'em.

01:35:03.239 --> 01:35:06.200
Well, now you have a matched set.

01:35:10.204 --> 01:35:11.664
He was so loved.

01:35:17.420 --> 01:35:18.963
And all these people...

01:35:20.465 --> 01:35:21.674
they all loved him.

01:35:33.144 --> 01:35:36.898
Every funny person in the world is here,
and no one's laughing.

01:35:40.193 --> 01:35:41.778
You know, he's right.

01:35:42.403 --> 01:35:44.989
Come on, people. Laugh, God damn it!

01:35:45.615 --> 01:35:47.325
Come on! Somebody!

01:35:49.994 --> 01:35:50.995
Henry.

01:35:58.419 --> 01:35:59.337
Henry...

01:36:00.505 --> 01:36:02.006
I'm sorry about everything.

01:36:04.217 --> 01:36:05.969
I know you accept my apology.

01:36:06.052 --> 01:36:09.597
I mean, you were wrong, too.
We don't have to get into that now.

01:36:10.431 --> 01:36:14.978
But this situation absolutely requires

01:36:15.061 --> 01:36:17.480
a really futile and stupid gesture.

01:36:22.944 --> 01:36:24.278
Do it, Henry.

01:36:32.370 --> 01:36:33.496
Oh.

01:36:37.583 --> 01:36:39.544
Food fight!
