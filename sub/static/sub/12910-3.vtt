02:44.944 --> 02:49.384
- Name?
- Savastano, Pietro.

02:59.504 --> 03:02.344
Open your mouth.

03:05.264 --> 03:08.184
Lift the tongue.

03:13.384 --> 03:16.784
Bend your knees.

03:16.864 --> 03:21.144
- In a broader position.
- Does your wife know you like it?

03:21.224 --> 03:23.384
Farther down.

03:25.784 --> 03:28.024
Host.

03:39.424 --> 03:44.304
I'll take it.
- Stick to your work.

03:59.384 --> 04:03.824
There was another policy earlier.

04:03.904 --> 04:09.224
It's time to sort things out.
It is no privileges.

04:09.304 --> 04:14.424
Do you understand what Savastano?
No one has privileges.

04:14.504 --> 04:17.744
You're just like all the others.

04:21.863 --> 04:24.544
Cell 32

04:35.424 --> 04:41.344
It's not up for discussion.
- You just have to toe the line, Don Pietro.

04:41.424 --> 04:45.744
- But do not worry.
- Get me a mobile.

04:53.224 --> 04:55.784
Cell 32

05:03.104 --> 05:07.064
<i>Don Pietro Savastano has come.</i>

05:15.864 --> 05:18.144
<i>Don Piè.</i>

05:18.224 --> 05:21.104
Hello, Don Pietro.

05:23.784 --> 05:27.464
At your service, Don Pietro.

05:28.504 --> 05:31.424
Hello, Don Piè.

05:40.864 --> 05:44.104
Sissy. Don Piè.

05:44.184 --> 05:48.304
- Good morning, ladies.
I'll take it, do Piè.

05:48.384 --> 05:51.504
- Peppi, low coffee.
- Now I'll be there.

05:51.584 --> 05:57.984
Luciano! Help me to ready up.
Don Pietro will probably rest.

05:58.064 --> 06:02.184
- Are you still here?
- I was thrown in again.

06:02.264 --> 06:06.104
Don Pietro. Diego, at your service.

06:09.384 --> 06:14.624
I'm waiting for my judgment.
They took me 52 bags of cocaine.

06:14.704 --> 06:18.664
- You, Pasqualino?
- I am waiting also.

06:18.744 --> 06:22.504
Robbery and kidnapping
in Mergellina, a jeweler.

06:22.584 --> 06:26.744
An idiot started the alarm.
I took him hostage.

06:26.824 --> 06:31.104
It was ugly.
It was the police from all sides-

06:31.184 --> 06:35.184
Even in the helicopter.
It was like in the movies.

06:35.264 --> 06:39.744
I also started a robbery in Mergellina.

06:39.824 --> 06:44.504
We have probably robbed the same idiot
with thirty years.

06:44.584 --> 06:50.064
Yes, but when I robbed him,
he had been alert.

06:50.144 --> 06:52.784
How much did you get out of it?

06:52.864 --> 06:56.544
No money and I'm waiting for the judgment.

06:56.624 --> 07:02.384
The water is boiling. Get it fast.
Daniele, deck table.

07:02.464 --> 07:05.704
Go, and Antonio.

07:20.384 --> 07:22.664
Rino.

07:22.744 --> 07:27.104
- How are you?
What the hell do you think?

07:27.184 --> 07:32.784
Head before it is not easy for us
Now he will frisk us.

07:32.864 --> 07:35.424
He can stick two fingers up.

07:35.504 --> 07:39.664
Say Gennaro is printed, and all is well.

07:39.744 --> 07:42.304
Don Pietro may be missing something.

07:42.384 --> 07:46.464
I'll take care of it, Ciro.
- Take care, Rino.

07:53.464 --> 07:57.904
Come on, sissy.
One, two... Faster.

08:02.504 --> 08:06.304
To be tomato sauce on linguine with lobster.

08:06.384 --> 08:10.504
I fry first garlic and chili oil.

08:10.584 --> 08:14.824
In the lobster boiling over
then a glass of white wine.

08:14.904 --> 08:18.744
So I put four small tomatoes in...

08:18.824 --> 08:21.824
Don Pietro belongs certainly not after.

08:29.224 --> 08:32.224
Don Pietro only talk to me.

08:36.823 --> 08:40.784
I promise that you'll get them tomorrow.

08:52.224 --> 08:54.904
Don Pietro.

08:54.984 --> 08:57.944
Don Piè. All due respect.

08:58.024 --> 09:00.864
Hello, Don Piè.

09:00.944 --> 09:04.024
Hello, Don Pietro.

09:06.064 --> 09:08.384
Good day.

09:30.064 --> 09:33.664
We must do something about the water.

09:33.744 --> 09:36.544
It sounds like a hen who wet.

09:37.584 --> 09:41.464
Savastano, you must go back to the cell.

09:41.544 --> 09:44.584
I come when I'm done.

10:03.184 --> 10:05.864
Pasqualino?

10:07.464 --> 10:10.624
What happened to you?

10:10.704 --> 10:14.384
I go to court next week.
So I'm down.

10:14.464 --> 10:17.504
It's gonna be fine.

10:18.784 --> 10:21.224
<i>Savastano</i>

10:27.544 --> 10:32.184
Have you prayed about it? Sign this, please.

10:35.784 --> 10:39.944
Don Pietro.
Your son has been printed and are doing well.

10:51.944 --> 10:55.104
It is not Conte hash

10:55.184 --> 10:59.544
- But it's not bad,
and the price is affordable.

10:59.624 --> 11:01.744
Sit.

11:01.824 --> 11:04.384
Ciro! Your mobile.

11:08.584 --> 11:11.944
- That's him.
It's Don Pietro.

11:13.224 --> 11:17.544
Word of the Lord!
Don Piè, I appreciate listening to.

11:18.984 --> 11:22.584
<i>We listen.
- Are you good?</i>

11:22.664 --> 11:27.544
- We are doing well now.
- How are you doing in there?

11:27.624 --> 11:32.424
It is a transit.
What about the agreement in Terzo Mondo?

11:32.504 --> 11:35.864
Everything went well. De Rosa thanks.

11:35.944 --> 11:39.664
Tell him to stay out.

11:39.744 --> 11:45.624
Curcio to talk to Russo
on the municipal housing.

11:46.864 --> 11:48.504
And the dope?

11:48.584 --> 11:53.584
We Di Vaio and Carluccio,
but they are scared shitless.

11:53.664 --> 12:00.184
They just need to know
that Conte still manages from prison.

12:00.264 --> 12:04.304
Let me talk to them, and show who's boss.

12:04.384 --> 12:08.624
Later, at. 13 Give me the number.
I must go.

12:08.704 --> 12:11.344
See you.

12:14.664 --> 12:19.024
What the hell are you doing here?
Get up against the wall.

12:24.304 --> 12:27.424
Hearing you? Up the wall.

12:27.504 --> 12:30.984
Did you lose something?

12:38.584 --> 12:41.544
Up against the wall, Savastano.

12:47.624 --> 12:50.584
You bastard!

12:51.904 --> 12:54.264
What the hell... Go now.

12:54.344 --> 12:58.184
Relax.
You are fully up and running.

13:04.464 --> 13:06.424
Grissini.

13:06.504 --> 13:09.704
- Visitation.
What happens now?

13:09.784 --> 13:12.304
Right in the food.

13:13.504 --> 13:18.304
- They always come.
- You can not even sit down.

13:21.104 --> 13:25.424
I go out two at a time.

13:25.504 --> 13:29.264
Hurry up. Come on.

13:29.344 --> 13:34.344
Get out. Everyone goes into the holding cell.

13:34.424 --> 13:36.304
Be quiet.

13:57.064 --> 13:59.144
- Zecchinè.
- What's up, Totò?

13:59.224 --> 14:02.264
He's with me.
- I come early.

14:02.344 --> 14:06.344
We will not miss:
to talk to Don Pietro.

14:06.424 --> 14:08.584
It is an honor, right?

14:08.664 --> 14:12.464
Yes, we will not miss.

14:12.544 --> 14:16.704
Try to understand us.
It's all about contacts.

14:16.784 --> 14:20.224
We must be protected,
if we break with Conte.

14:20.304 --> 14:25.504
- Is my promise not enough?
It's more than enough.

14:25.584 --> 14:30.104
But it is easier, if I talk to Don Pietro.

14:30.184 --> 14:34.504
- I speak with him.
- I must have patience.

14:34.584 --> 14:39.064
So talk to him as you will.

15:00.384 --> 15:03.064
Pasqualino.

15:07.104 --> 15:10.184
What have they done to you?

15:22.904 --> 15:25.944
What is it? Are you worried?

15:26.944 --> 15:31.144
I have to solve a big problem, Pasqualino.

15:31.224 --> 15:36.664
That damn prison director slows it all.

15:44.304 --> 15:47.984
It's late, Zecchinè.
I have to go.

15:49.384 --> 15:54.144
We try another time, Totò.
We try tomorrow.

15:54.224 --> 15:57.504
Take care, Zecchinè.

16:16.384 --> 16:23.144
They are scared shitless
and dare not move forward with us.

16:23.224 --> 16:26.544
But we need to smoke.

16:26.624 --> 16:30.464
We need to be there.
People know what is happening.

16:30.544 --> 16:36.264
Conte is in Spain, and Don Pietro
Poggio Reale. It is up to us.

16:36.344 --> 16:41.024
Right now the fastest solution
the two idiots.

16:54.744 --> 16:58.944
Honorable prison leader.
What do I owe the honor?

17:00.624 --> 17:05.704
I thought we understood each other,
but I was wrong.

17:05.784 --> 17:10.664
Sin. In isolation you should probably learn
how to behave.

17:10.743 --> 17:13.104
Damn.

17:14.223 --> 17:18.344
I am at your disposal.

17:23.664 --> 17:29.224
I need a lover, I will hang myself.

17:30.304 --> 17:35.064
In here the sun shines never
Eternal cries, no peace.

19:45.784 --> 19:49.184
It sucks.

19:49.264 --> 19:54.144
- I feel bad without smoke.
- Come with me.

19:54.224 --> 19:57.744
- France, take it here.
Here, Pasquale.

19:57.824 --> 20:01.224
Take it and send it on.

20:05.904 --> 20:08.824
How, indeed.

20:56.344 --> 20:59.584
Close the doors.

21:32.904 --> 21:36.144
Toni keeps space for signora Imma.

21:41.424 --> 21:45.984
Don Pietro Savastanos wife is here.
- What about her?

21:46.064 --> 21:49.144
- She's going into.
- Is she in?

21:49.224 --> 21:52.224
We are here to tomorrow at noon. 7

21:52.304 --> 21:55.304
Who is it to be in?

21:55.384 --> 21:58.784
How can this be?

22:01.544 --> 22:06.584
Let her get into.
It is Don Pietro's wife.

22:40.544 --> 22:43.064
Hey, Dad.

22:45.344 --> 22:48.704
- How are you?
- Good.

22:49.824 --> 22:54.424
- What about you?
- He has been checking.

22:54.504 --> 22:58.184
- The bleeding has stopped.
- Have you any better?

22:58.264 --> 23:01.264
Yes, I'm fine, Dad.

23:01.344 --> 23:04.144
Try to get me out as soon as you can.

23:04.224 --> 23:07.864
Yes. The lawyer says
You can be calm.

23:07.944 --> 23:11.944
It is easy for him to say.

23:12.024 --> 23:15.184
Are you sure you're okay?

23:22.384 --> 23:26.024
Do they take you well?
Are you using the Rino?

23:26.104 --> 23:30.184
The prison manager has moved Rino.

23:30.264 --> 23:34.864
But it does not matter.
There is soon interrogation.

23:34.944 --> 23:38.304
If the lawyer does his job.

23:38.384 --> 23:43.464
Ciro say that they have not been
a new contact. What do we do?

23:43.544 --> 23:46.704
What to do? Find another.

23:49.264 --> 23:52.624
Give Musi money
and say that they must be liquid.

23:52.704 --> 23:56.024
- Do you understand Gennaro?
- Yes.

23:56.104 --> 23:59.344
Everything will be fine
if you have the money.

23:59.424 --> 24:03.824
- What did you do with your hair?
- Nothing. Why?

24:03.904 --> 24:08.304
It looks wildly like a lion's mane.

24:08.384 --> 24:11.424
- Come on.
- That's right.

24:26.264 --> 24:29.544
Now you're the man of the house.

24:44.064 --> 24:49.224
Today we get good food.
Mom made chicken and potatoes.

24:57.584 --> 25:00.304
What is this?

25:09.744 --> 25:13.384
What are you doing?
- I must be questioned today.

25:13.464 --> 25:19.264
I look like a gypsy.
The verdict is written on my forehead.

25:19.344 --> 25:23.384
I have not even sit down to the judge.

25:26.384 --> 25:29.304
Here.

25:29.384 --> 25:32.384
Put this on.

25:32.464 --> 25:36.104
No, it can not accept.

25:36.184 --> 25:39.864
Pasqualino, take your shirt on.

25:45.064 --> 25:48.504
What an ugly shirt.

25:58.104 --> 26:01.864
Now you look like a law-abiding man.

26:02.984 --> 26:05.504
Thank you, Don Pietro.

26:05.584 --> 26:09.504
One can see that it has been costly.

26:10.584 --> 26:14.984
This is money
which makes a law-abiding.

26:34.504 --> 26:37.264
What is it that sucks?

26:37.344 --> 26:43.544
The drug addicts putting money
in the pants. It's not perfume.

26:44.544 --> 26:49.944
But you can not smell it,
when the money is placed in the bag.

27:02.744 --> 27:05.224
What are you thinking?

27:05.304 --> 27:09.544
In all of the underpants, containing money.

27:48.224 --> 27:51.264
Too bad they closed the place.

27:51.344 --> 27:55.664
It never opened.
It has always been closed.

28:06.424 --> 28:10.624
We must go. Musi soon.

28:12.344 --> 28:16.584
We're a big family.
- Family is important.

28:17.824 --> 28:20.624
Fragrance again.

28:20.704 --> 28:24.704
- Your wife makes heavenly food.
Thank you, Antonio.

28:28.184 --> 28:31.784
Did you wash your hands? To starboard.

28:31.864 --> 28:34.744
Come on.

28:36.864 --> 28:40.424
- Visitation.
- Again?

28:41.824 --> 28:44.664
We'll never peace.

28:48.384 --> 28:51.024
Come on.

28:51.104 --> 28:54.304
Hurry up. Moving on.

29:24.264 --> 29:26.784
Lift arms.

29:31.184 --> 29:33.344
Lift.

29:40.824 --> 29:45.344
What happened to Don Pietro?
Everything be all right?

29:45.424 --> 29:48.224
We do not know yet.

29:48.304 --> 29:53.904
But he will always be our leader,
My father is a lion.

29:55.304 --> 30:02.144
Keep the money we give
you cash. There must be earned on them.

30:02.224 --> 30:05.424
- Government bonds. AAA.
- Liquidity I said.

30:05.504 --> 30:10.784
It is cash. You sell
them easily. AAA is without risk.

30:10.864 --> 30:16.344
As they grow anyway.
You can recoup them.

30:17.784 --> 30:21.664
Okay. As long as they are liquid.

30:21.744 --> 30:25.984
Take Finland.
The outlook is stable.

30:26.064 --> 30:29.344
It's almost cash.

30:32.664 --> 30:35.304
Then do it.

30:36.304 --> 30:39.024
Are we done?

31:07.864 --> 31:10.064
What a mess.

31:10.144 --> 31:13.464
- They are messy.
They've knocked things.

31:13.544 --> 31:17.344
- We have no water.
- We did not have water?

31:17.424 --> 31:21.024
It is not something in the sink or faucet.

31:21.104 --> 31:25.704
That damn prison leader.
He pisses me off now.

31:25.784 --> 31:29.144
We can not do anything.
He decides.

31:29.224 --> 31:31.824
Really?

32:16.224 --> 32:18.344
Close.

32:43.304 --> 32:46.624
Can I ask you something?

32:46.704 --> 32:50.024
When was the last time you
together with a lady?

32:51.024 --> 32:53.944
We must do something about it.

32:57.464 --> 33:01.304
It is blonde.
Her from Casavatore.

33:01.384 --> 33:04.424
The one who screwed up.

33:06.384 --> 33:10.184
Maybe. But it is impossible.

33:12.824 --> 33:16.144
I make a call.

33:27.864 --> 33:30.904
Everything should be carefully planned.

33:30.984 --> 33:34.624
It is important that you understand that?

33:34.704 --> 33:39.504
I'll have to hang up.
Talk to you later. Hey.

34:09.143 --> 34:15.664
- Did you see his reaction?
- He was speechless.

34:15.744 --> 34:18.184
Do you know why?

34:18.264 --> 34:21.583
For the girl, the car, everything he owns...

34:21.664 --> 34:24.543
It's ours.

34:24.623 --> 34:27.944
Exactly. Now you're with.

34:31.103 --> 34:36.143
Gennaro. When we stick together,
no one can stop us.

34:37.424 --> 34:42.543
- You seem distracted.
- I hear you.

34:53.704 --> 34:56.504
What happened?

34:59.144 --> 35:02.064
I got ten years.

35:08.544 --> 35:10.944
You...

35:11.024 --> 35:14.504
Do not worry about it. Relax.

35:15.664 --> 35:20.224
We do like this:
Tomorrow we'll call your lawyer.

35:20.304 --> 35:25.584
We ask for house arrest.
At worst, you will be placed.

35:38.864 --> 35:42.704
Genny! Genny! Genny!

36:23.824 --> 36:28.504
- Thank you for coming.
What would you do?

36:29.744 --> 36:36.344
I feel like a king tonight.
Will you be my queen?

36:46.544 --> 36:49.504
Hello taxes. Hi, Genny.

37:09.064 --> 37:13.304
- Where are we going?
It's a surprise.

37:18.304 --> 37:21.784
- Wait for me.
- Here you go, follow me.

37:24.824 --> 37:27.704
Hey, Toni.
- Are you back?

37:27.784 --> 37:31.384
Talk to me.
- Good evening.

37:32.504 --> 37:37.864
Please come into.
My son always talk about you.

37:37.944 --> 37:40.584
It's my pleasure.

37:40.664 --> 37:44.824
- Show her balcony.
- Here you go.

38:46.344 --> 38:51.824
Is that Alessio?
- You're my queen tonight.

38:55.784 --> 38:58.744
Good evening. Give a hand.

39:00.184 --> 39:04.024
- What do you hear?
- "Ancora noi".

39:07.944 --> 39:12.104
- "Ancora noi"!
- Who will it be dedicated to?

39:12.184 --> 39:15.064
Noemi, the beautiful girl here.

39:15.144 --> 39:18.344
And the father who is in prison.

39:18.424 --> 39:22.024
And Salvatore Conte,
the big idiot-

39:22.104 --> 39:26.744
- Who was afraid and ran off to Spain.

39:34.744 --> 39:38.224
Put your hands up.

40:29.424 --> 40:30.904
Pasqualino?

40:35.664 --> 40:38.064
Now open the door.

40:40.264 --> 40:44.944
- Open to hell.
- Antonio, call the guard.

40:45.024 --> 40:48.144
- Help me.
What's going on?

41:08.104 --> 41:10.984
Put your hands up.

41:44.144 --> 41:47.224
Sentry. Sentry.

42:16.544 --> 42:18.944
Cell 32

42:35.744 --> 42:38.984
Everybody out here

42:39.064 --> 42:41.704
Come on.

43:00.064 --> 43:02.584
Thank you.

43:07.224 --> 43:10.744
Alessio! Alessio! Alessio!

43:14.304 --> 43:15.784
Thank you.

43:23.104 --> 43:28.704
There's nothing to do.
Take the first two of 40

43:28.784 --> 43:32.544
Genny! Genny! Genny!

43:41.624 --> 43:47.344
It just lie to say
it is enough that it is probably...

43:48.344 --> 43:52.344
You will die in the quiet night.

43:52.424 --> 43:55.464
Thank you.

44:18.584 --> 44:20.904
Mother.

44:20.984 --> 44:23.264
Come on.

44:25.024 --> 44:31.464
Mom, this is Noemi,
who have sown a seed in my heart.

44:32.904 --> 44:36.304
Noemi. It is Imma, my mother.

44:36.384 --> 44:39.064
Nice to meet you.

44:39.144 --> 44:41.864
You too.

44:44.504 --> 44:49.184
Come in for a moment.
I want to talk to you.

44:49.264 --> 44:52.024
Wait for me.

45:08.864 --> 45:12.904
Why are you home so late
and behave like that?

45:12.984 --> 45:18.504
And then you are a stranger girl
home, completely unannounced.

45:19.544 --> 45:22.384
Mother.

45:23.464 --> 45:28.184
You should not be worried.
I'm great now.

45:29.304 --> 45:33.024
I have mastered it.

45:34.824 --> 45:37.864
I'll take care of it all.

45:37.944 --> 45:44.304
You heard what father said, right?
I'm the man of the house now.
