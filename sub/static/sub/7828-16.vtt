00:50.200 --> 00:53.100
Go, toothpaste. Go!
Move your pasty, white butt!

00:53.200 --> 00:55.500
Come on, shampoo!
You can do it!

00:55.700 --> 00:58.100
I won your stupid
bathroom-products race!

00:58.300 --> 01:00.900
No fair. You only won
because you had the inside track.

01:01.100 --> 01:02.700
If the water had spun
the other way...

01:02.900 --> 01:05.500
It never spins the other way.
In the Northern Hemisphere...

01:05.600 --> 01:07.500
...water always drains
counter-clockwise.

01:07.600 --> 01:09.100
It's called the Coriolis effect.

01:09.300 --> 01:12.500
No way.
Water doesn't obey your rules.

01:12.700 --> 01:15.100
It goes where it wants.
Like me, babe.

01:15.300 --> 01:18.800
Yes, Bart.
Why don't you try it and see.

01:21.400 --> 01:24.100
I know I've seen it go the other way.

01:24.300 --> 01:26.600
Ah, faithful toilet.

01:26.700 --> 01:28.600
You'll prove me right.

01:35.600 --> 01:38.600
I'm singing in the show...

01:38.800 --> 01:41.000
Hot! Cold!

01:41.200 --> 01:45.100
Hot! Cold! Hot!
Who's doing that?

01:47.800 --> 01:51.600
Oh, for Pete's sake, Bart,
use the plunger.

01:51.800 --> 01:55.000
Bart, water will only go the other way
in the Southern Hemisphere.

01:55.200 --> 01:57.800
What the hell
is the Southern Hemisphere?

01:58.000 --> 01:59.900
Haven't you ever looked at your globe?

02:01.900 --> 02:05.900
See? The Southern Hemisphere is made
up of everything below the equa...

02:07.800 --> 02:09.699
This line.

02:10.100 --> 02:13.300
So down there in, say, Argentina...

02:13.500 --> 02:16.600
...or Rand McNally,
all their water runs backwards?

02:17.600 --> 02:21.100
In fact, in Rand McNally,
they wear hats on their feet...

02:21.200 --> 02:24.400
...and hamburgers eat people.
- Cool.

02:42.800 --> 02:44.100
Hello, Southern Hemisphere?

02:44.300 --> 02:46.300
Which way does the water go
in your toilet?

02:46.500 --> 02:48.900
Just a minute, I'll check.

02:55.100 --> 02:56.400
Nuts.

03:00.200 --> 03:03.800
Please to repeat again, and I will
translating for the el presidente.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.800
Which way does the water turn
in your toilet?

03:16.600 --> 03:20.000
I can't get a straight answer
out of this crazy hemisphere.

03:27.700 --> 03:29.500
- Nuisance phone.

03:36.300 --> 03:38.500
Bart, you can't actually call
these places.

03:38.700 --> 03:42.800
Don't you know how expensive
international calls are?

03:43.500 --> 03:46.400
Hello, operator,
I'd like to make a collect call...

03:46.900 --> 03:48.200
...to Australia.

03:55.800 --> 03:59.100
This is the operator.
Will you accept a collect call from...?

03:59.300 --> 04:02.600
Yes, this is Dr. Bart Simpson of
the International Drainage Commission.

04:02.800 --> 04:04.900
- It's an emergency.
- If it's an emergency...

04:05.100 --> 04:07.600
We understand drains in your area
have malfunctioned...

04:07.800 --> 04:11.200
...sucking in people and whatnot.
- Willikers! That's awful!

04:11.300 --> 04:14.200
Indeed. We need you to check
your sinks and toilets...

04:14.400 --> 04:18.800
...and tell us which way the water
is going. And please stand clear!

04:24.900 --> 04:27.900
The fixtures, they're all
draining clockwise, sir.

04:28.100 --> 04:30.500
She was right.
Stupid Lisa, science queen.

04:30.700 --> 04:34.200
Well, why don't you just check
your neighbors' drains. I'll hold.

04:38.400 --> 04:42.600
Hey, Bart, the bakery caught fire
and all of downtown smells like cookies.

04:42.700 --> 04:44.000
Want to go smell?

04:44.500 --> 04:47.300
Yes. Yes, I do.

04:54.100 --> 04:57.100
Hello, sir? Sir?

04:57.200 --> 05:01.100
I've returned from the Quilamaguery's
place. They're draining clockwise too.

05:01.300 --> 05:03.300
Draining?
I don't care about that anymore.

05:03.500 --> 05:04.900
Are we in any dang...

05:09.800 --> 05:14.600
"Burkina Faso"? "Disputed Zone"?
Who called all these weird places?

05:14.800 --> 05:16.600
Quiet, it might be you.
I can 't remember.

05:16.800 --> 05:20.100
- No, I'm gonna ask Marge.
- No! No! Why embarrass us both?

05:20.200 --> 05:23.200
Just write a check and I'll release
some more endorphins.

05:25.900 --> 05:29.400
Nine hundred dollary-doos?! Tobias!

05:29.500 --> 05:32.900
Did you accept a six-hour collect call
from the States?

05:33.100 --> 05:34.400
It was an emergency call...

05:34.500 --> 05:37.700
...from the International Drainage
Commission in Springfield.

05:37.900 --> 05:40.900
Oh, my God! There's nothing wrong
with the bidet, is there?

05:42.500 --> 05:44.500
- Hello?
- Right, I'm calling all the way...

05:44.500 --> 05:46.300
...from Squatter's Crog, Australia.

05:46.500 --> 05:50.600
And I want to speak
to Dr. Bart Simpson right now.

05:50.800 --> 05:52.800
- Hold, please.
- All right, but I don't...

05:53.000 --> 05:55.300
Hello. Burt Stanton speaking.

05:55.400 --> 05:58.200
I said, Bart Simpson!
What kind of company is this?

05:58.300 --> 05:59.600
Bart Simpson's office.

05:59.800 --> 06:02.200
Thank the great, good Lord.
Look, I was just saying...

06:02.300 --> 06:04.300
One moment, please.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.700
Who do they think I am,
some stupid Aussie drongo?

06:08.900 --> 06:10.400
Bleeding Yanks. I ought to...

06:10.500 --> 06:13.500
This is Bart Simpson.
Can I help you, ma'am?

06:13.700 --> 06:15.900
Yeah...
My name is Bruno Drundridge, right.

06:16.100 --> 06:17.900
You owe me $900, mate!

06:18.000 --> 06:21.400
- No, you owe me $900!
- All right, you...

06:22.000 --> 06:24.300
You're just some punk kid, aren't you?

06:24.500 --> 06:28.600
You picked the wrong guy
to tangle with here, mate.

06:28.800 --> 06:32.000
I don't think so.
You're all the way in Australia.

06:32.100 --> 06:35.600
Hey, I think I hear
a dingo eating your baby.

06:37.400 --> 06:41.000
That's it! I'm gonna report this
to me member of Parliament.

06:41.200 --> 06:42.700
Hey, Gus!

06:42.800 --> 06:44.800
I got something to report to you!

06:45.000 --> 06:47.500
That's a bloody outrage, it is!

06:47.700 --> 06:51.600
I'm gonna take this all the way
to the prime minister!

06:53.400 --> 06:57.000
Hey, Mr. Prime Minister!

06:57.200 --> 06:58.400
Andy!

06:58.900 --> 07:01.500
Aye, mates. What's the good word?

07:03.200 --> 07:05.100
"Mr. Simpson," blah, blah.

07:05.300 --> 07:07.500
"Misrepresentation over telephone..."

07:07.700 --> 07:09.500
"Sincerely," some Australian jerk.

07:18.400 --> 07:20.700
Hey, I need that!

07:20.900 --> 07:22.700
"Office of the Solicitor General"?

07:22.900 --> 07:24.700
"Office of the Prime Minister"?

07:24.900 --> 07:28.600
"Hopping Mad Collection Agency"?
What is all this stuff?

07:28.800 --> 07:32.800
Nothing. Some stupid country
thinks I owe them money.

07:32.900 --> 07:35.900
Bart, you better talk
to Mom and Dad about this.

07:36.200 --> 07:39.700
Hey, guys? Just so you don't hear
any wild rumors, I'm being indicted...

07:39.900 --> 07:43.400
...for fraud in Australia.
- That's no reason to block the TV.

07:43.600 --> 07:45.100
Oh, my.

07:47.800 --> 07:52.400
Bart, did you trick an Australian boy
into accepting a $900 collect call?

07:52.600 --> 07:53.900
Yes'm.

07:54.100 --> 07:59.200
There it is, Australia. I'll be damned.

07:59.600 --> 08:02.300
Look at this country.
"You-are-gay."

08:07.600 --> 08:11.400
Oh, my. Hello. I'm Evan Conover
with the U.S. State Department.

08:11.400 --> 08:17.000
"Undersecretary for International
Protocol, Brat and Punk Division."

08:17.200 --> 08:20.600
Unfortunately, your little escapade
could not have come at a worse time.

08:20.800 --> 08:24.400
Americo-Australianian relations
are at an all-time low.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.600
In the late 1980s, the U.S. Experienced
a short-lived infatuation...

08:30.900 --> 08:32.200
...with Australian culture.

08:33.799 --> 08:35.900
The Aussies thought
this would be permanent.

08:37.200 --> 08:39.900
I know those words,
but that sign makes no sense.

08:40.100 --> 08:43.100
Anyway, the down-under fad fizzled,
and the diplomatic climate...

08:43.299 --> 08:45.200
...turned absolutely frosty.

08:46.800 --> 08:48.900
Let's pretend we didn't see that.

08:49.600 --> 08:53.000
And Bart's childish taunting
agitated the Aussies further.

08:53.200 --> 08:57.500
Oh, he'll agitate you. He sure will.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
- What can we do for you?
- It's too late...

09:04.200 --> 09:05.600
...to pay back the money.

09:05.700 --> 09:08.300
But as a sign of good faith
to our Australian friends...

09:08.400 --> 09:10.600
...we'd like to imprison Bart
for five years.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.600
That's tough but fair.
Boy, go with the man.

09:13.800 --> 09:16.400
No, no, no!

09:16.600 --> 09:20.800
I'm not gonna have my son go to jail
over some silly tiff with Australia.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.800
You'll just have to find some
other country to have relations with.

09:24.900 --> 09:27.700
You're sure, now?
The prison train is sailing.

09:27.900 --> 09:30.800
Okay, I'm not hearing a lot
of support for prison.

09:30.900 --> 09:32.800
There is one other option.

09:33.000 --> 09:37.100
They'll drop the charges if Bart
makes a public apology in Australia.

09:37.300 --> 09:40.500
All Bart has to do is apologize
and we get a free trip to Australia?

09:41.600 --> 09:44.000
I can handle that.
I'm an expert at phony apologies.

09:44.100 --> 09:45.500
- Bart!
- I'm sorry.

09:45.700 --> 09:47.500
That's better.

10:19.200 --> 10:22.100
We left at 1:30 p.m., Monday.
What time is it now?

10:22.300 --> 10:24.400
It's 6:45 a.m., next Wednesday.

10:24.500 --> 10:27.700
You may also be interested to know
that it's summer here, not winter.

10:29.600 --> 10:32.900
What does that sign say? I thought
they spoke English in this country.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.100
It says you can't bring in
outside plants or animals.

10:36.300 --> 10:41.300
Any foreign creature you bring in
could upset the environmental balance.

10:42.800 --> 10:46.300
Sorry, girl, I don't want to get in
any more trouble down here.

10:46.600 --> 10:49.200
I'll pick you up on the way home.

11:05.200 --> 11:07.700
Hey, are you, like, one
of those English guards...

11:07.900 --> 11:10.500
...who can't laugh or smile
or anything?

11:15.400 --> 11:17.700
No, sir! U.S. Marine Corps, sir!

11:20.400 --> 11:23.000
Oh, yeah. This is the life.

11:23.200 --> 11:26.500
Boy, next summer can you commit
some fraud in Orlando, Florida?

11:26.700 --> 11:28.400
I'm way ahead of you, Dad.

11:28.600 --> 11:31.700
Knock. Simpsons, I'd like you
to meet our ambassador...

11:31.800 --> 11:33.400
...the Honorable Averil Ward.

11:33.600 --> 11:37.000
Hello. Now, everything is all set
for Bart's apology.

11:37.200 --> 11:39.900
Mr. Conover will meet you
at the Parliament House at 3 p.m.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.300
Any questions?

11:41.400 --> 11:43.600
- Do the toilets go backwards in here?
- No.

11:43.800 --> 11:46.300
To combat homesickness,
we have a device that makes...

11:46.500 --> 11:48.300
...them swirl the correct American way.

11:53.900 --> 11:57.400
Sweet land of liberty

11:57.600 --> 12:00.700
Of thee I sing

12:04.300 --> 12:08.000
Hey, GI Joe, your sign's broken.
We're already in Australia.

12:08.200 --> 12:11.100
Actually, sir, the embassy is considered
American soil, sir.

12:11.300 --> 12:14.300
Really? Look, boy.
Now I'm in Australia.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.900
Now I'm in America.
Australia. America.

12:17.100 --> 12:18.900
- Australia.
- I get it, Dad.

12:19.100 --> 12:21.500
Homer, that's enough.

12:22.400 --> 12:24.900
Here in America,
we don't tolerate that crap, sir.

12:28.800 --> 12:32.000
"Australia was founded as a
settlement for British convicts."

12:32.200 --> 12:33.900
Lisa, watch your camera.

12:40.600 --> 12:41.800
You call that a knife?

12:42.600 --> 12:44.400
This is a knife.

12:44.600 --> 12:48.200
- That's not a knife. That's a spoon.
- All right, all right. You win.

12:48.900 --> 12:51.200
I see you've played
knifie-spoonie before.

12:53.100 --> 12:57.900
Hey, give me one of those famous
giant beers I've heard so much about.

12:58.100 --> 12:59.500
Something wrong, Yank?

12:59.600 --> 13:02.800
No. It's pretty big, I guess.

13:03.200 --> 13:06.000
- I'll just have a cup of coffee.
- Beer it is.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.500
No, I said, coffee.

13:07.700 --> 13:10.500
- Beer?
- Coffee.

13:10.600 --> 13:12.100
Beer?

13:12.300 --> 13:16.200
- C-O...
- B-E...

13:21.600 --> 13:24.300
We'll meet you boys back here
for dinner. Good luck, honey.

13:25.700 --> 13:28.300
Bart, I'm sorry I'm gonna miss
your public humiliation.

13:28.500 --> 13:32.600
But the Walambaloo Dirt Monument
is just too exciting to pass up.

13:39.200 --> 13:43.100
Hear ye! Hear ye!
This session will now come to order.

13:43.400 --> 13:45.900
With the cooperation
of the U.S. Department of State...

13:46.000 --> 13:48.100
...we have present today
one Bart Simpson.

13:51.200 --> 13:53.400
I believe he has something to say.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.200
Bart?

14:02.900 --> 14:04.400
I'm sorry.

14:04.500 --> 14:07.600
I'm sorry for what I did
to your country.

14:09.100 --> 14:12.300
Well, you're free to go, Bart...

14:12.500 --> 14:14.000
...right after your
additional punishment.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.700
- Punishment!
- A mere apology would be a bit empty.

14:18.900 --> 14:20.700
Let the booting begin!

14:20.800 --> 14:23.500
- Booting?
- It's just a little kick in the bum.

14:39.600 --> 14:42.700
What kind of a sick country would
kick someone with a giant boot?

14:42.900 --> 14:46.300
Mr. Simpson, shush. Disparaging
the boot is a bootable offense.

14:46.400 --> 14:48.700
It's one of their proudest traditions.

14:53.700 --> 14:56.500
You sold us out, Conover!

15:04.800 --> 15:07.800
Stand back or I'll boot
your prime minister! I'll do it.

15:07.900 --> 15:10.400
So help me God, I'll boot him!

15:11.600 --> 15:13.200
When will you Australians learn?

15:13.400 --> 15:16.000
In America,
we stopped using corporal punishment.

15:16.200 --> 15:18.800
And things have never been better.
The streets are safe...

15:19.000 --> 15:22.100
...old people strut confidently through
the darkest alleys...

15:22.200 --> 15:26.400
...and the weak and nerdy are admired
for their computer-programming abilities.

15:26.500 --> 15:30.400
So like us,
let your children run wild and free...

15:30.600 --> 15:33.200
...because, as the old saying goes:

15:33.200 --> 15:36.700
"Let your children run wild and free."

15:36.900 --> 15:42.000
Now, boy, run back to the embassy!
Back to American soil!

15:45.100 --> 15:47.100
I'll stop them.

15:49.700 --> 15:52.000
Oh, no, it's coming back this way.

15:52.200 --> 15:55.500
That throwing stick stunt of yours
has boomeranged on us.

15:59.100 --> 16:01.600
Hey, we can get away
in their pouches.

16:04.100 --> 16:05.900
It's not like in cartoons.

16:06.100 --> 16:08.500
Yeah. There's a lot more mucus.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.200
Mom, you said I could
have one souvenir, right?

16:15.400 --> 16:16.600
Well, I want a didjeridu.

16:21.800 --> 16:25.900
That seems very noisy and expensive
for a souvenir.

16:26.100 --> 16:29.800
Why don't you get this nice cap.
It's clever, just like you.

16:32.800 --> 16:37.800
Get out! Get out! Shoo! Shoo!
Get out of here!

16:38.000 --> 16:41.400
These bloody things are everywhere.
They're in the lift, the lorry...

16:41.500 --> 16:44.000
...in the bon whizzer,
and the Malonga Gilderchuck.

16:44.200 --> 16:48.100
They're like kangaroos.
But they're reptiles, they is.

16:48.200 --> 16:50.500
We have them in America.
They're called bullfrogs.

16:50.700 --> 16:52.700
What? That's an odd name.

16:52.800 --> 16:55.000
I'd have called them chazwazzers.

16:57.100 --> 16:59.300
Lisa!

16:59.500 --> 17:01.300
Marge!

17:10.000 --> 17:11.300
The Simpsons.

17:11.400 --> 17:13.800
Well, they're not getting back in here.

17:27.500 --> 17:30.200
I can't believe our government
would set up Bart like that.

17:30.400 --> 17:33.100
I'm very angry
at the State Department right now.

17:33.200 --> 17:37.000
Yes, but... Please, we're about to reach
a breakthrough with the Aussies.

17:37.100 --> 17:40.700
Then it's agreed. During the bargaining
session, we each get two candy apples.

17:40.900 --> 17:43.000
All right, one candy and one caramel.

17:43.200 --> 17:45.100
Oh, for the love of criminy!
Give me that!

17:45.300 --> 17:47.900
I know Bart did something wrong.
But he's my son...

17:48.000 --> 17:50.500
...and I'm going to punish him myself.

17:50.700 --> 17:52.800
Our countries
may have their differences...

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
...but as human beings,
I think we can all agree...

17:56.200 --> 18:00.900
...there's no substitute for the discipline
of a loving parent.

18:01.500 --> 18:03.300
He wants to talk to you.

18:03.500 --> 18:05.300
Hello.

18:05.600 --> 18:06.900
So we're in agreement.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.200
She won't be allowed
near the phone again.

18:10.300 --> 18:11.600
We did it.

18:11.800 --> 18:15.200
We've worked out a compromise
that will allow both nations to save face.

18:15.400 --> 18:16.900
We've argued them down to...

18:17.000 --> 18:18.300
...a booting.
- What?

18:18.500 --> 18:21.900
The prime minister just wants
to kick you once through the gate...

18:22.100 --> 18:24.700
...with a regular shoe.
- I believe it's a wingtip.

18:24.900 --> 18:27.800
No deal.
This is my son we're talking about.

18:27.900 --> 18:31.000
Sure, he's not perfect,
but who is in this workaday world?

18:31.200 --> 18:33.400
No. Mom, wait.

18:40.400 --> 18:44.400
It's time for me to bend over
and receive my destiny.

18:49.000 --> 18:53.600
Thank you, Bart. I promise
I won't make fun of you later for this.

18:53.800 --> 18:56.700
Show them what American butts
are made of, son.

19:01.100 --> 19:02.400
That's it, lad.

19:02.800 --> 19:05.800
This is for the
Commonwealth of Australia.

19:12.500 --> 19:14.700
And this is
for the United States of America.

19:31.300 --> 19:32.700
I'm glad you're okay, honey.

19:32.900 --> 19:35.600
But I wish you'd chosen a more
tasteful way to be patriotic.

19:35.700 --> 19:39.100
I'm impressed you were able
to write so legibly on your own butt.

19:50.100 --> 19:52.900
All right, mates, let them have it!

19:56.400 --> 19:58.600
Hey, do we get to land
on an aircraft carrier?

19:58.700 --> 20:01.900
No, sir. The closest vessel
is the USS Walter Mondale.

20:02.100 --> 20:04.900
It's a laundry ship.
They'll take you the rest of the way.

20:17.700 --> 20:21.600
Hey, look.
Those frogs are eating all their crops.

20:26.500 --> 20:29.400
Well, that's what happens
when you introduce foreign species...

20:29.500 --> 20:32.100
...into an ecosystem
that can't handle them.
