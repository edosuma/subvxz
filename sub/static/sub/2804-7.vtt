GRABBING A DRINK AFTER WORK.

09:56.247 --> 09:58.859
THIS ATTRACTIVE WOMAN APPROACHES
AND STARTS CHATTING ME UP.

09:58.946 --> 10:01.035
SHE INVITES ME
OVER TO HER PLACE.

10:01.122 --> 10:02.514
YOU GET THE IDEA.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.386
OH, NO.
WE SEE THE IDEA.

10:04.473 --> 10:05.735
I SWEAR TO YOU,
BEFORE THIS MORNING,

10:05.822 --> 10:06.823
I HAD NO IDEA WHO SHE WAS.

10:06.910 --> 10:08.216
DID YOU THROW TODAY
ON PURPOSE?

10:08.303 --> 10:09.434
Josh: NO.

10:09.521 --> 10:11.436
I GOT RATTLED.
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

10:11.523 --> 10:13.047
Neal:
AND IF YOU STEP DOWN,

10:13.134 --> 10:15.440
THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE
A CRIMINAL GOES FREE.

10:15.527 --> 10:17.181
WHAT'S THE POINT
OF ARRESTING THESE BASTARDS

10:17.268 --> 10:18.269
IF YOU CAN'T PROSECUTE THEM?

10:18.356 --> 10:19.314
CAN YOU HELP?

10:26.538 --> 10:29.280
Peter: THESE ARE THE PHOTOS
BEING USED TO BLACKMAIL BRYSON.

10:29.367 --> 10:30.586
Jones:
THAT'S DELANCY'S GIRLFRIEND?

10:30.673 --> 10:32.109
Neal: SHE IS DEDICATED
TO HER MAN.

10:32.196 --> 10:34.024
AND LIMBER.

10:34.111 --> 10:35.809
AND UNFORTUNATELY,
SHE'S NOT TALKING.

10:35.896 --> 10:37.375
WE'LL HAVE TO GO AFTER
THE NEXT BEST THING.

10:37.462 --> 10:39.682
LANDON SHEPARD.

10:39.769 --> 10:42.729
SHE WAS DELANCY'S FIRST CALL
AFTER HIS ARREST LAST YEAR.

10:42.816 --> 10:44.513
AND SHE WAS
IN COURT YESTERDAY.

10:44.600 --> 10:46.602
SAYS SHE'S
AN EXECUTIVE CONSULTANT.

10:46.689 --> 10:47.951
SHE'S WHO YOU CALL

10:48.038 --> 10:50.040
WHEN THE C.E.O.
OF YOUR FORTUNE 500 COMPANY

10:50.127 --> 10:51.520
CRASHES HIS BENTLEY

10:51.607 --> 10:53.522
WITH HIS 18-YEAR-OLD
MISTRESS'S HEAD ON HIS LAP.

10:53.609 --> 10:55.611
OR WHEN THE FBI
IS CLOSING IN

10:55.698 --> 10:57.613
AND YOU'VE GOT A VIAL
OF BENZENE IN THE TOP
DRAWER OF YOUR DESK.

10:57.700 --> 10:59.528
SHE'S A FIXER.Jones: SHE'S GOOD.
SHE'S CONNECTED.

10:59.615 --> 11:02.183
A YEAR LATER, WE STILL
CAN'T PIN ANYTHING ON HER.

11:02.270 --> 11:03.706
CAN WE SUBPOENA
HER PHONE RECORDS?

11:03.793 --> 11:05.360
ALL INCOMING CALLS
GO TO AN OFFICE VOICE MAIL.

11:05.447 --> 11:08.842
SO FAR, WE'VE BEEN UNABLE
TO LINK ANY OTHER NUMBER TO HER.

11:08.929 --> 11:10.365
SHE GETS IN YOUR HEAD.

11:10.452 --> 11:12.106
I MEAN, I QUESTIONED
HER A YEAR AGO, AND
IN FIVE MINUTES,

11:12.193 --> 11:14.761
SHE COULD TELL THINGS ABOUT ME
THAT MY OWN MOTHER COULDN'T.

11:14.848 --> 11:16.414
IT WASN'T RIGHT.

11:16.501 --> 11:18.025
WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY
TO GET TO HER.

QUESTIONS ABOUT ME

11:35.303 --> 11:36.260
BEHIND MY BACK.

11:36.347 --> 11:37.784
AGAIN.

11:37.871 --> 11:39.742
I THOUGHT I'D STOP BY
AND SAVE YOU THE TROUBLE.

11:39.829 --> 11:41.744
AGENT BERRIGAN AND I
WOULD LOVE TO CHAT WITH YOU.

11:41.831 --> 11:43.485
NO CLINTON JONES TODAY?

11:43.572 --> 11:44.660
DON'T TELL ME.

11:44.747 --> 11:46.314
HE'S OFF SEEKING
DADDY'S APPROVAL

11:46.401 --> 11:47.358
THROUGH OVERACHIEVEMENT.

11:47.445 --> 11:49.012
I GOT 15 MINUTES.

11:49.099 --> 11:51.493
I ASSUME YOUR INTERROGATION ROOM
IS THIS WAY.

11:58.021 --> 12:01.111
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT
VICTOR DELANCY'S GIRLFRIEND?

12:01.198 --> 12:03.200
I CAN TELL YOU A LOT OF THINGS
ABOUT A LOT OF PEOPLE.

BUT THE ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY
WORKING THE DELANCY CASE --

12:13.210 --> 12:14.603
NOT SO MUCH
FROM WHAT I HEAR.

12:14.690 --> 12:17.693
SO YOU ADMIT
VICTOR DELANCY'S A CLIENT?

12:17.780 --> 12:19.869
OH, MY CLIENTS EXPECT ANONYMITY. I ADMIT NOTHING.

12:19.956 --> 12:21.305
Neal:
IT'S A GAME TO HER.

12:21.392 --> 12:24.134
IF I DIDN'T KNOW
ANY BETTER,

12:24.221 --> 12:27.572
I'D THINK SHE SENSES
MY PRESENCE.

12:27.659 --> 12:29.792
YOU CALL YOURSELF
AN EXECUTIVE CONSULTANT.

12:29.879 --> 12:31.402
WHAT DOES THAT ENTAIL?

12:31.489 --> 12:33.622
I PROVIDE MY CLIENTS
WITH MUCH-NEEDED STRUCTURE.

12:33.709 --> 12:35.232

VERY MUCH IN LOVE.

12:51.901 --> 12:53.381
LISTEN, YOU --
EASY.

12:55.165 --> 12:57.167
SHE'S CONTROLLING
THE ENTIRE INTERVIEW.

12:57.254 --> 12:58.734
YEAH, BECAUSE
PETER'S LETTING HER.

12:58.821 --> 13:00.170
HE'S PLAYING
TO SHEPARD'S EGO.

WE'D MET SOONER.

I HIT A ROUGH PATCH
HERE AT THE BUREAU
A MONTH OR SO BACK.

13:15.359 --> 13:17.709
OH, THAT'S A SHAME.
I COULD HAVE PUT IN
A GOOD WORD FOR YOU.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.059
WITH WHO?

13:19.146 --> 13:20.408
THE MAYOR
OR THE WINDOW WASHER?

13:20.495 --> 13:21.801
WHO DO YOU THINK?

13:21.888 --> 13:25.761
I THINK YOUR REAL SKILL
IS THE ART OF THE BLUFF,

13:25.848 --> 13:28.895
MAKING CLAIMS YOU KNOW FULL WELL
YOU CAN'T BACK UP.

13:34.683 --> 13:36.903

13:42.343 --> 13:44.998
INDEED,
IT HAS BEEN SOME TIME.

13:45.085 --> 13:47.435
WELL, WE CAN CONFIRM
SHE'S GOT A CELL.

13:47.522 --> 13:49.567
THAT'S PETER'S PLAY.

13:49.654 --> 13:51.656
IF IT WERE REGISTERED
UNDER HER REAL NAME,
WE'D KNOW ABOUT IT.

13:51.743 --> 13:53.049
FOR A SUBPOENA, WE'D NEED
EITHER HER ALIAS --

13:53.136 --> 13:54.703
OR HER CELL NUMBER.

SHE HAS THE CONNECTIONS
TO MAKE THEM ROLL OVER,

AT CLEANING UP MESSES.

STEVE TABERNACKLE,

16:01.395 --> 16:03.701
HAS SOME COMPROMISING PHOTOS
OF ME AND ANOTHER MAN

TO EXPOSE.

16:05.877 --> 16:07.705

TO DESTROY THEM,

16:07.792 --> 16:09.490
SO I WAS HOPING
MAYBE YOU COULD.

16:09.577 --> 16:11.666

BEGIN TO DESCRIBE HIM.

CANAL WITH A DOZEN EX-FELONS --

OF HIS PAROLE.

more than prison.

MR. CAFFREY, IS THIS THE VIAL
VICTOR DELANCY SHOWED YOU

37:06.876 --> 37:08.313
ON NOVEMBER 1st
OF LAST YEAR?

37:09.618 --> 37:11.533

Josh: MR. CAFFREY,
FOR TWO WEEKS, YOU WORKED

37:22.631 --> 37:25.373
AS A HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL
SENIOR BIOCHEMICAL ANALYST

37:25.460 --> 37:26.722
AT CAPLIN ENVIRONMENTAL.

OBJECTION.

37:28.028 --> 37:29.551
HOW DOES BEING
A FAKE SCIENTIST

37:29.638 --> 37:31.466
QUALIFY THIS MAN
TO IDENTIFY BENZENE?

37:31.553 --> 37:33.860
I'D VERY MUCH LIKE AN ANSWER
TO THAT MYSELF.

37:33.947 --> 37:36.123
Neal: YOUR HONOR, I WAS
CONVICTED OF BOND FORGERY.

37:36.210 --> 37:38.865
FORGERY IS AS MUCH SCIENCE
AS IT IS ART.

37:38.952 --> 37:41.084
AND DOES THE GOVERNMENT CONSIDER
YOU AN EXPERT IN FORGERY?

37:41.171 --> 37:42.564

37:45.175 --> 37:48.178
WOULD YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN TO
THE COURT WHAT CHECK WASHING IS?

37:48.266 --> 37:49.745
CHECK WASHING
IS THE PROCESS

37:49.832 --> 37:51.486
OF DISSOLVING THE INK
FROM A CHECK,

37:51.573 --> 37:53.532

FOR ANY AMOUNT.

37:53.619 --> 37:55.185
AND HOW
IS THAT ACCOMPLISHED?

37:55.273 --> 37:57.623
WELL, TYPICALLY, THE CHECK
IS SOAKED IN BENZENE.

37:57.710 --> 38:00.930
SO, NOT ONLY IS BENZENE
A TOXIC POLLUTANT,

38:01.017 --> 38:03.716
IT'S ALSO A CHEMICAL

38:03.803 --> 38:05.283
TO REMOVE INK
FROM A PERSONAL CHECK?

38:05.370 --> 38:06.719
THAT'S CORRECT.

38:06.806 --> 38:08.895
MR. CAFFREY, WHEN YOU'RE KNOWN
IN SOME CIRCLES

38:08.982 --> 38:11.724
AS A CON MAN AND A LIAR,

38:11.811 --> 38:13.160
WHY SHOULD WE BELIEVE A WORD
OF ANY OF THIS?

38:13.247 --> 38:15.510
OH, YOU SHOULDN'T.

38:15.597 --> 38:17.904

FOR THE COURT

38:35.922 --> 38:38.141
HOW SCIENCE CAN PROVE
THIS VIAL CONTAINS BENZENE?
