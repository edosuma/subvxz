There you are, Kyle.

00:42.666 --> 00:43.957
I was gonna see
if you and brother

00:44.083 --> 00:45.582
wanted to go down
to the bowling alley.

00:45.708 --> 00:46.415
No, no, Dad, please.

00:46.541 --> 00:48.040
I just got Call of Duty:
Advanced Warfare.

00:48.166 --> 00:49.415
Me and Ike
are gonna play it together.

00:49.541 --> 00:50.749
It's your day off.

00:50.875 --> 00:53.415
You boys really want to spend it
inside in front of the TV?

00:53.541 --> 00:55.332
Please, Dad, I've been looking
forward to this all week!

00:55.458 --> 00:56.749
And it's me and Ike's
bonding time.

00:56.875 --> 00:58.707
Really. This is good
for our relationship.

00:58.833 --> 00:59.707
All right.

00:59.833 --> 01:02.249
I swear I'll never understand
you kids these days.

01:02.375 --> 01:03.874
Yes!

01:07.708 --> 01:08.749
Hey, Ike!

01:08.875 --> 01:10.915
Look what I got --
the new Call of Duty!

01:11.041 --> 01:12.415
You want to go downstairs
and play?

01:15.000 --> 01:16.332
Meh.

01:18.708 --> 01:19.665
"Meh"?

01:19.791 --> 01:21.249
Ike, we have the whole day
to play Xbox.

01:21.375 --> 01:22.665
Mom and Dad are leaving!

01:22.791 --> 01:25.707
Maybe later, 'kay?

01:25.833 --> 01:27.082
What are you watching?

01:27.208 --> 01:29.499
How's it going, bros?
My name's PewDiePie.

01:29.625 --> 01:31.415
We're playing Call of Duty:
Advanced Warfare.

01:31.541 --> 01:32.832
Here we go.

01:32.958 --> 01:35.082
Ah! People are
shooting at me, bros!

01:35.208 --> 01:36.749
You're watching someone
play Call of Duty

01:36.875 --> 01:37.915
and talk about it?

01:38.041 --> 01:40.082
PewDiePie!

01:40.208 --> 01:42.374
There's lots of bullets,
and I got to run!

01:42.500 --> 01:43.457
Run for the bunker!

01:43.583 --> 01:44.582
Raaaaah!

01:44.708 --> 01:46.999
But, Ike, we can go play
the game downstairs.

01:47.125 --> 01:47.999
Isn't that better

01:48.125 --> 01:50.624
than watching some guy
on YouTube playing it?

01:50.750 --> 01:52.624
Meh.

01:52.750 --> 01:54.207
Look at this.
Look at this.

01:55.208 --> 01:58.124
Oh, gigrrig!

02:00.250 --> 02:02.207
Dude, I'm telling you,
it's crazy.

02:02.333 --> 02:03.415
All my little brother
wants to do

02:03.541 --> 02:05.915
is sit on YouTube watching
this PewDiePie play video games.

02:06.041 --> 02:08.207
I swear I don't understand kids
these days.

02:08.333 --> 02:10.290
- What's a PewDiePie do?
- Google him!

02:10.416 --> 02:11.582
He's this guy from Sweden

02:11.708 --> 02:13.874
who has over 30 million
YouTube subscribers.

02:14.000 --> 02:14.707
We didn't even know,

02:14.833 --> 02:16.707
but he's a bigger celebrity
to kids than anyone.

02:16.833 --> 02:18.124
It's just seems so lame.

02:18.250 --> 02:20.499
He plays video games
and makes millions of dollars,

02:20.625 --> 02:21.790
and it's lame how?

02:21.916 --> 02:23.957
Because -- Because that's
not even entertainment.

02:24.083 --> 02:27.040
I mean, it's just -- just
rehashing shit, isn't it?

02:27.166 --> 02:29.207
It's like everything these kids
are into these days, you know?

02:29.333 --> 02:31.540
It's just rehashed shit.

02:31.666 --> 02:33.207
This Saturday!

02:33.333 --> 02:34.582
At the Pepsi Center!

02:34.708 --> 02:36.332
It's Women of Rock!

- Michael Jackson's hologram!

02:46.250 --> 02:47.374
♪ Hee hee! ♪

02:47.500 --> 02:50.082

02:53.125 --> 02:55.165
Tickets on sale now.

02:57.666 --> 02:58.582
Yeah, it's me.

02:58.708 --> 03:00.999
I told you
I can't play the concert.

03:01.125 --> 03:03.082
Come on.
This is a great lineup.

03:03.208 --> 03:05.540
Look, I do a lot of
post-production enhancements

03:05.666 --> 03:08.207
to make my music sound
the way it does, okay?

03:08.333 --> 03:09.874
I feel like if I play live,

03:10.000 --> 03:12.582
I'm gonna
really disappoint people.

03:12.708 --> 03:14.165
I'm sorry,
but the answer is no.

03:14.291 --> 03:16.540
I don't think
you're really in a position

03:16.666 --> 03:18.165
to turn down this kind of gig.

03:18.291 --> 03:19.915
What is that supposed to mean?

03:20.041 --> 03:23.540
I understand your son gave
all your savings to Canada.

03:23.666 --> 03:26.957
Yes. Freemium gaming.

03:27.083 --> 03:30.290
I'm sorry.
Freemium gaming destroys lives.

03:30.416 --> 03:33.040
I lost my father
to Candy Crush.

03:35.083 --> 03:36.332
You need this, Lorde,

03:36.458 --> 03:38.540
and the girls out there
need you.

03:38.666 --> 03:41.290
You've got till tomorrow
to think it over.

03:43.500 --> 03:45.332
I love Candy Crush.

03:45.458 --> 03:49.040
All I wanted was to play
one level of Call of Duty,

03:49.166 --> 03:50.332
and you know
what Ike told me?

03:50.458 --> 03:52.957
He said the living room
is for old people.

03:53.083 --> 03:54.790
I don't get it.
The whole fun of Call of Duty

03:54.916 --> 03:56.290
is that you get to do
the shooting.

03:56.416 --> 03:58.415
I know! But that
doesn't matter anymore!

03:58.541 --> 03:59.915
These kids don't want to play
the game!

04:00.041 --> 04:01.707
They just want to watch people
on YouTube play it!

04:01.833 --> 04:04.207
And you know why?
Commentary.

04:04.333 --> 04:05.624
- Mrphrmhrm?
- Yeah.

04:05.750 --> 04:07.624
You used to sit in the living
room with family and friends

04:07.750 --> 04:09.207
to hear their commentary
on things.

04:09.333 --> 04:11.624
Now you can get it with a little
guy in a window on the screen,

04:11.750 --> 04:13.290
someone who just comments
on stuff.

04:13.416 --> 04:16.707
I mean, really, who would even
want to do that?

04:16.833 --> 04:17.707
Hey, brahs, what's going on?

04:17.833 --> 04:19.582
This is
Cartmanbrah!

04:19.708 --> 04:21.749
Be sure to subscribe to my
channel if you haven't already.

04:21.875 --> 04:23.374
'Cause
subscribin' makes you feel good!

04:23.500 --> 04:25.540
So today I'm
gonna comment on Call of Duty.

04:25.666 --> 04:26.915
More specifically,
I'm going to comment

04:27.041 --> 04:28.415
on my friends commenting
on Call of Duty

04:28.541 --> 04:29.624
so let's start.

04:29.750 --> 04:32.832
All I wanted was to play
one level of Call of Duty...

04:32.958 --> 04:34.207
That's Kyle the Jew again,

04:34.333 --> 04:36.207
talking about Call of Duty
to Stan.

04:36.333 --> 04:37.790
I don't get it.
The whole fun of Call of Duty

04:37.916 --> 04:39.124
is that you get to do
the shooting.

04:39.250 --> 04:40.540
Stan is such a douche bag.

04:40.666 --> 04:42.082
He just agrees with Kyle
no matter what.

04:42.208 --> 04:43.374
These kids don't want to play
the game!

04:43.500 --> 04:44.874
They just want to watch people
on YouTube play it!

04:45.000 --> 04:46.832
There's Kenny commenting
on Call of Duty.

04:46.958 --> 04:48.249
Kenny! Kenny! Speak up!

04:48.375 --> 04:50.290
Speak through the hood,
Kenny!

04:52.291 --> 04:53.165
Mom! Dad!

04:53.291 --> 04:55.707
Kelly and Stacy are going to
the Women of Rock concert.

04:55.833 --> 04:57.499
Can I go with them?

04:57.625 --> 04:59.124
I don't know, Shelly.

04:59.250 --> 05:02.040
But, Mom, Lorde is playing!

05:02.166 --> 05:04.582
You can't not let me go,
or I'll hate you forever!

05:04.708 --> 05:06.499
Shelly,
there's a good chance

05:06.625 --> 05:08.915
Lorde isn't going to show up.

05:09.041 --> 05:10.124
She will too!

05:10.250 --> 05:11.165
She has to show up,

05:11.291 --> 05:13.874
and if I don't get to see her,
I'm gonna kill myself!

05:14.000 --> 05:15.040
And what if you go

05:15.166 --> 05:17.540
and Lorde doesn't sound so great
in person?

05:17.666 --> 05:18.999
That doesn't matter, Dad.

05:19.125 --> 05:21.040
We love Lorde
because she's real!

05:21.166 --> 05:23.457
God, you guys
don't understand anything!

05:24.541 --> 05:27.874
You know, I think Lorde
is going to play tomorrow.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.624
So, can I go or not?!

05:29.750 --> 05:31.374
If she means that much
to you.

05:31.500 --> 05:33.874
Okay, yay, thanks!
Love you guys.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.749
So, you're doing it?

05:35.875 --> 05:37.124
How can I let her down?

05:37.250 --> 05:38.540
You mind finishing up here?

05:38.666 --> 05:40.207
I think I should practice
a little.

05:40.333 --> 05:41.707
Of course not.

05:41.833 --> 05:44.749
Anything to keep you away
from cock magic.

05:44.875 --> 05:48.332
Uh, so today I'm gonna
comment on Call of Duty.

05:48.458 --> 05:49.874
Hey, Ike, you want to come
watch TV with me?

05:50.000 --> 05:51.374
More specifically,
I'm going to comment

05:51.500 --> 05:52.999
on my friends commenting
on Call of Duty.

05:53.125 --> 05:54.290
- So let's start.
- Oh, no. No, Ike.

05:54.416 --> 05:56.499
You are not watching him
comment on things!

05:56.625 --> 05:57.832
All I wanted
was to play...

05:57.958 --> 05:59.082
That's Kyle the Jew again,

05:59.208 --> 06:00.999
talking about Call of Duty
to Stan.

06:01.125 --> 06:02.332
What the fuck?

06:02.458 --> 06:03.832
Stan is such a douche bag.

06:03.958 --> 06:05.665
He just agrees with Kyle
no matter what.

06:05.791 --> 06:06.707
Ike, that is enough.

06:06.833 --> 06:07.999
If you're interested
in Call of Duty

06:08.125 --> 06:10.165
then go play it downstairs
in the living room!

06:10.291 --> 06:12.332
God, these guys are
so annoying, aren't they?

06:12.458 --> 06:13.957
Cartmanbrah!

06:14.000 --> 06:15.207
But that's all
that matters now...

06:15.333 --> 06:17.415
Cartmanbrah!

06:19.208 --> 06:20.499
What do you think
you're doing?!

06:20.625 --> 06:22.790
Shooting for the "d"
in a game of Horsedick.

06:22.916 --> 06:24.165
You know what I mean!

06:24.291 --> 06:25.790
Why is my little brother
watching you

06:25.916 --> 06:27.624
talking about us
talking about him?

06:27.750 --> 06:29.790
I have a YouTube blog
where I comment on video games.

06:29.916 --> 06:30.624
Big whoop.

06:30.750 --> 06:33.165
I don't need Ike listening to
you comment on anything!

06:33.291 --> 06:34.249
What are you talking about?

06:34.375 --> 06:36.332
This fat fuck thinks
he's PewDiePie.

06:36.458 --> 06:38.374
Because of him, I can't get Ike
to come out of his room!

06:38.500 --> 06:39.415
Because of me?

06:39.541 --> 06:40.874
I'm pretty sure
I'm not the person

06:41.000 --> 06:42.207
who invented Let's Plays,
Kyle.

06:42.333 --> 06:43.207
Let's Plays?

06:43.333 --> 06:44.415
That's what they're called,
dude.

so next we'll need you,
Nicki Minaj,

07:11.333 --> 07:12.207
then Iggy Azalea,

07:12.333 --> 07:14.499
who will be performing with
a hologram of Michael Jackson,

07:14.625 --> 07:16.499
and then finally you, Lorde.

07:16.625 --> 07:18.332
Have a great show, ladies!

07:19.708 --> 07:20.624
Hey, uh, listen --

07:20.750 --> 07:23.374
I-I thought I could do this,
but it's not gonna work.

07:23.500 --> 07:25.457
You're nervous.
It's understandable.

07:25.583 --> 07:26.749
No, I'm...

07:26.875 --> 07:30.165
I know for a fact that I don't
sound the same live.

07:30.291 --> 07:33.207
You think those people out there
care what you sound like?

07:33.333 --> 07:35.165
You're just another
female pop star.

07:35.291 --> 07:37.540
Just go out there and pump
your hips and rub your clit.

07:37.666 --> 07:39.999
Hey! That's not what my music
is about!

07:40.125 --> 07:41.540
I'm not reducing myself
to that!

07:41.666 --> 07:42.999
Oh, fuck you, Lorde.

07:43.125 --> 07:44.915
You think you're so much better
than everyone.

07:45.041 --> 07:46.415
No, I don't, Iggy.

07:46.541 --> 07:47.999
I just think
that our younger girl fans

07:48.125 --> 07:50.749
need something a little
more positive as role models.

07:50.875 --> 07:52.165
That's easy for you to say

07:52.291 --> 07:54.415
because you don't have
a nice body!

07:54.541 --> 07:56.332
Is that why you're
so high and mighty, Lorde?

07:56.458 --> 07:59.207
Because you're jealous
of this booty?!

07:59.333 --> 08:01.582
Iggs, I really don't care to
go through this again with you.

08:01.708 --> 08:03.124
'Cause let's face it --

08:03.250 --> 08:05.832
You've got legs
that look like a horse!

08:05.958 --> 08:06.832
Fuck you!

08:10.791 --> 08:12.624
All right, that's enough!
Look at yourselves!

08:12.750 --> 08:15.874
You're an Internet
bullshit artist, Lorde!

08:17.833 --> 08:18.707
Hey. What's up?

08:18.833 --> 08:20.999
- You're not gonna believe this.
- Oh, no. What now?

08:21.125 --> 08:22.499
I wanted to get Ike
out of his room,

08:22.625 --> 08:24.207
so I invited all his friends
over for a slumber party

08:24.333 --> 08:26.124
to play
Dragon Age: Inquisition.

08:26.250 --> 08:28.290
- Yeah?
- Come on.

08:28.416 --> 08:30.249
...just laying there.

08:31.375 --> 08:32.665
You see?
Look at this.

08:32.791 --> 08:34.124
Ike has all his friends over,

08:34.250 --> 08:36.124
and they're just sitting around
on their own computers,

08:36.250 --> 08:37.415
barely talking to each other.

08:37.541 --> 08:39.290
Ike is watching PewDiePie
play Dragon Age.

08:39.416 --> 08:40.374
I'm going.

08:40.500 --> 08:41.790
♪ Dun-dun, da-da-dun-dun,
da-da-dan ♪

08:41.916 --> 08:43.624
- PewDiePie!
- PewDiePie!

08:43.750 --> 08:44.957
And this kid
is watching Cartman

08:45.083 --> 08:46.915
commenting on people
commenting on Dragon Age!

08:47.041 --> 08:49.374
It's a really great game.
The characters are so rich!

08:49.500 --> 08:52.249
Butters is such a butthole.
Oh, my God. Cartmanbrah!

08:52.375 --> 08:53.790
- Cartmanbrah!
- Cartmanbrah!

08:53.916 --> 08:55.915
Dude, video games are meant
to be played in a living room,

08:56.041 --> 08:57.499
not something to watch people
comment on.

08:57.625 --> 09:00.790
Okay, grandpa, we'll be sure
to keep that in mind.

09:02.250 --> 09:04.040
- "Grandpa"?!
- This is how they talk to us.

09:04.166 --> 09:05.290
You better
watch your mouth, kid!

09:05.416 --> 09:06.124
Yeah, Conner.

09:06.250 --> 09:09.040
We're supposed to respect
our elders, remember?

09:09.166 --> 09:12.207
It's best to just make
old people think they matter.

09:12.333 --> 09:14.415
Oh, is that right? Do you
even know how to multiply?

09:14.541 --> 09:17.415
No, sir. Thank goodness
we have you to do that.

09:19.541 --> 09:20.707

Thanks for loving me!
I love you, too!

10:24.000 --> 10:26.624
So, I guess there's this
new trend with young people

10:26.750 --> 10:28.832
where the celebrities
they look up to most

10:28.958 --> 10:30.415
are YouTube commentators --

10:30.541 --> 10:33.624
just ordinary people
who sit in front of a mike

10:33.750 --> 10:36.124
and blab their opinions
about everything

10:36.250 --> 10:38.582
while their mindless
loyal followers cheer them on.

10:38.708 --> 10:40.249
Isn't that crazy?

10:42.500 --> 10:45.457
Well, let's meet one of
these stars of the Internet.

10:45.583 --> 10:48.165
Please welcome Cartmanbrah.

10:48.291 --> 10:50.040
Cartmanbrah!

10:50.166 --> 10:52.499
So can you explain
to our audience members

10:52.625 --> 10:56.457
over the age of 5
what it is that you do?

10:56.583 --> 10:57.790
Well, Wendy, I started

10:57.916 --> 10:59.582
by talking about people
talking about video games,

10:59.708 --> 11:01.415
but now I'm branching out
into talking about people

11:01.541 --> 11:03.457
talking about music
and the arts, as well.

11:03.583 --> 11:05.249
And why do you think
young people --

11:05.375 --> 11:07.707
Cartmanbrah!

11:07.833 --> 11:10.749
Why do you think young people
are responding to this?

11:10.875 --> 11:13.915
Why dah do thin'

11:14.041 --> 11:15.374

13:12.458 --> 13:14.249
Ooh!

13:18.500 --> 13:22.790
Could you, um,
pass the potatoes, Stan?

13:22.916 --> 13:24.874
Great. Thanks.

13:27.083 --> 13:28.249
Well, nobody's talking.

13:28.375 --> 13:30.707
Doesn't anyone have anything
to talk about?

13:31.875 --> 13:34.374
Why did you have to rub
your clit onstage, Dad?

13:34.500 --> 13:36.290
I was told to.

13:36.416 --> 13:39.582
You were told to walk out
in front of 100,000 people,

13:39.708 --> 13:42.249
including little girls
who look up to you,

13:42.375 --> 13:44.582
and start rubbing your clit?

13:44.708 --> 13:45.582
Okay, hold on.

13:45.708 --> 13:47.374
"A," I don't have a clit,

13:47.500 --> 13:49.249
so, technically,
I wasn't rubbing anything.

13:49.375 --> 13:52.082
And "B," I didn't want to
even perform tonight,

13:52.208 --> 13:54.124
but Stanley gave
all our money to Canada

13:54.250 --> 13:55.332
through a freemium game,

13:55.458 --> 13:58.957
so if anyone rubbed their clit,
it was him.

13:59.083 --> 14:01.249
Pff.

14:30.958 --> 14:32.165
It's dying.

14:32.291 --> 14:35.207
The living room is dying.

14:39.208 --> 14:41.874
Yeah, it's me.
I need to fix this.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.540
How can I undo
the clit rubbing?

14:44.666 --> 14:47.040
What are you talking about?
It's great!

14:47.166 --> 14:49.874
You're the most commented-on
artist in the world right now.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.165
You're blowing up Twitter

14:51.291 --> 14:52.749
and you're trending
on Cartmanbrah.

14:52.875 --> 14:54.207
#Clitnubbin.

14:54.333 --> 14:56.374
Look, this isn't what I want.
My music is supposed to be --

14:56.500 --> 14:58.874
it's not about the music,
Lorde.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.082
It never was.

15:01.666 --> 15:05.124
It's about comments.
And, sister, you got 'em.

15:05.250 --> 15:07.457
This ends now.

15:07.583 --> 15:10.332
I'm gonna tell people
the truth.

15:15.541 --> 15:18.207
Will you look at that?
Everyone on their cellphones.

15:18.333 --> 15:20.207
Nobody saying a word
to each other.

15:20.333 --> 15:21.665
Call me a grandpa,

15:21.791 --> 15:24.457
but I still like commenting
face-to-face with folks.

15:24.583 --> 15:26.332
You know what I mean, buddy?

15:26.458 --> 15:27.582
Yes.

15:27.708 --> 15:29.249
You're heading up
to the mountains, too, huh?

15:29.375 --> 15:30.499
Gonna do some skiing?

15:30.625 --> 15:34.332
No, I just need to take care of
some I-important business.

15:34.458 --> 15:36.415
Oh, what kind of business?
Are you a fisherman?

15:36.541 --> 15:38.082
Yes.
I mean -- Yes, that's all.

15:38.208 --> 15:39.915
I'm -- I'm just gonna fish
and hunt.

15:40.041 --> 15:43.082
Oh, you're a hunter.
What do you prey upon?

15:43.208 --> 15:45.665
Nobody!
That's ignorant!

15:45.791 --> 15:48.332
Well, you must have
a favorite kind of prey.

15:48.458 --> 15:51.082
Allegedly! Allegedly!
That's ignorant!

15:52.375 --> 15:54.332
You know,
excuse me for saying so,

15:54.458 --> 15:57.707
but you seem
kind of transparent.

15:57.833 --> 15:59.665
That's ignorant.
I'm just cold.

15:59.791 --> 16:01.374
I'm saying
it must make it easier

16:01.500 --> 16:03.040
to sneak up on your prey.

16:03.166 --> 16:05.332
Allegedly!
I'm weary of this conversation.

16:05.458 --> 16:07.332
Can we please stop talking?
Please?

16:07.458 --> 16:08.999
Ignorant.

16:10.333 --> 16:12.749
Well, whatever it is
you're after, I hope you get it.

16:12.875 --> 16:14.540
Oh, I will.

16:14.666 --> 16:16.540
Trust me. I will.

16:25.250 --> 16:26.332
Oh, we've lost any ability

16:26.458 --> 16:27.915
to track
the hologram's location.

16:28.041 --> 16:29.457
It -- It looks like
it reprogrammed

16:29.583 --> 16:30.665
its guidance systems.

16:30.791 --> 16:32.832
We paid a lot of money
for that hologram.

16:32.958 --> 16:35.290
You better find a way
to get it back.

16:35.416 --> 16:36.374
Project Alpha?

16:36.500 --> 16:38.790
Yes.
That might be our only option.

16:38.916 --> 16:40.249
What is Project Alpha?

16:40.375 --> 16:42.915
The first hologram we ever
created to appear onstage.

16:43.041 --> 16:44.124
It was a prototype,

16:44.250 --> 16:46.415
but perhaps the best thing
to stop a hologram...

16:46.541 --> 16:47.707
Is another hologram.

16:47.833 --> 16:49.040
Bring up Project Alpha.

16:49.166 --> 16:50.457
Sir, are you sure
that we want to --

16:50.583 --> 16:52.040
Bring it up!

16:55.708 --> 16:56.915
What is that?

16:57.041 --> 16:58.665
Tupac.

16:59.666 --> 17:01.290
Tupac.

17:01.416 --> 17:02.540
Yo.

17:02.666 --> 17:05.749
The hologram of Michael Jackson
is on the loose.

17:05.875 --> 17:09.207
We need you to take care
of the situation.

17:12.416 --> 17:14.999
Godspeed, Tupac.

17:17.833 --> 17:19.707
Oh, my gosh, honey!
Look, it's Tupac!

17:19.833 --> 17:22.499
I told you them homeys
didn't cap his ass.

17:26.791 --> 17:29.374
Oh, this is going
on Instagram.

17:29.500 --> 17:30.665
Hey, hey.
How's it going, brahs?

17:30.791 --> 17:32.707
This is Cartmanbrah.
Cartmanbrah!

17:32.833 --> 17:35.582
And we are -- It looks like
we are at the bus stop now.

17:35.708 --> 17:38.040
Yep. There's Kyle, Stan, and
Kenny looking stupid as ever.

17:38.166 --> 17:39.374
I don't know
what the hell to do.

17:39.500 --> 17:41.832
- The whole world's gone crazy.
- Tell me about it.

17:41.958 --> 17:43.874
Uh-oh. Looks like Kyle's taking
issue with something again.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.207
Kyle's got a problem!
Cartmanbrah!

17:46.333 --> 17:47.832
You know, you used to sit
in the living room

17:47.958 --> 17:49.707
with your friends and family,
and they were the ones

17:49.833 --> 17:51.457
commenting on
whatever was on TV.

17:51.583 --> 17:53.082
Oh, God.

17:53.208 --> 17:54.082
Do you mind?

17:54.208 --> 17:55.540
Oh, looks like
Kyle's commenting

17:55.666 --> 17:56.707
on my commenter window, brahs.

17:56.833 --> 17:58.957
Be sure to comment on that.
#Kyle'sgettingfrustrated.

17:59.083 --> 18:01.540
Dude! Nobody wants to hear you
commenting on things.

18:01.666 --> 18:04.832
Oh, really? 10,000 subscribers
and counting, brah.

18:10.416 --> 18:11.915
Thanks for seeing me.

18:12.041 --> 18:14.165
I've got my speech written.

18:14.291 --> 18:15.915
I'm ready to let the world
know the truth.

18:17.583 --> 18:18.749
Sit down, Lorde.

18:18.875 --> 18:21.832
I'm not interested in being
talked out of ending this.

18:21.958 --> 18:23.749
It's the right thing to do.

18:25.458 --> 18:28.582
Do you know what an artist
is now, Lorde?

18:28.708 --> 18:32.874
An artist is a conversation
piece, nothing more.

18:33.000 --> 18:36.665
Like a vase
or a kitschy side table.

18:36.791 --> 18:40.832
Just something
for people to comment on.

18:40.958 --> 18:42.249
The old ways are dying.

18:42.375 --> 18:44.290
We're not making money
off records.

18:44.416 --> 18:46.499
We're making money
off tweets,

18:46.625 --> 18:48.540
and you've taken it
to a whole new level.

18:48.666 --> 18:51.790
Well, that's not a world Lorde
ever wanted to be a part of.

18:51.916 --> 18:53.915
On the contrary,

18:54.041 --> 18:56.499
Lorde is going on
the Jimmy Fallon show tonight

18:56.625 --> 18:59.874
and exposing her asshole
for everyone to freak out about.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.957
I'll do no such thing.

19:02.083 --> 19:03.415
Who said anything about you?

19:15.750 --> 19:18.540
You can't just replace artists
with holograms.

19:18.666 --> 19:20.165
Who will make the content?

19:20.291 --> 19:23.790
Today,
commentary is the content.

19:23.916 --> 19:27.290
And you, I'm afraid,
are just in the way.

19:31.041 --> 19:33.665
Okay, children.
Let's take our seats.

19:33.791 --> 19:36.624
Before we get started, Kyle has
asked to say a few words.

19:36.750 --> 19:37.624
Go ahead, Kyle.

19:37.750 --> 19:39.915
What is happening
to our living rooms?

19:40.041 --> 19:41.624
There is a crisis in America,
and --

19:41.750 --> 19:43.374
Looks like
we're in the school now.

19:43.500 --> 19:45.332
Check out Wendy.
She's flat as a pancake.

19:45.458 --> 19:46.499
What the hell is that?

19:46.625 --> 19:48.499
It's Cartman's stupid
online persona.

19:48.625 --> 19:50.040
Oh, my dick's
getting hard again.

19:50.166 --> 19:51.249
It's protruding out my pants!

19:51.375 --> 19:52.499
What the hell?

19:52.625 --> 19:53.832
This is the way of the future,
Mr. Garrison.

19:53.958 --> 19:55.290
- It's true!
- That's right.

19:55.416 --> 19:57.332
Butters will back me up
on anything. He's such a bitch.

19:57.458 --> 19:58.165
Yeah.

19:58.291 --> 19:59.415
There is a crisis
in America

19:59.541 --> 20:01.207
as families grow further
and further apart --

20:01.333 --> 20:02.707
There is a crisis in America,

20:02.833 --> 20:04.457
and we have to save
our living rooms.

20:04.583 --> 20:06.207
Our living rooms are dying.

20:06.333 --> 20:07.707
Mr. Garrison,
will you make him stop?

20:07.833 --> 20:10.790
I don't -- I don't even
understand what's happening.

20:10.916 --> 20:13.457
This is the reason
why our living rooms are dying!

20:13.583 --> 20:15.582
This is the reason
our living rooms are dying!

20:15.708 --> 20:17.207
So we've got to do something.

20:17.333 --> 20:19.165
Eric Cartman's commenter window

20:19.291 --> 20:20.582
to the principal's office,
please.

20:20.708 --> 20:23.457
Eric Cartman's commenter window
to the principal's office.

20:23.583 --> 20:25.082
What the hell did I do?

20:25.208 --> 20:27.332
Eric, I've had
a lot of complaints

20:27.458 --> 20:30.290
that your online persona
is becoming a distraction.

20:30.416 --> 20:31.124
Well, this sucks.

20:31.250 --> 20:32.540
Looks like I'm
in the principal's office

20:32.666 --> 20:33.665
for just commenting
on things.

20:33.791 --> 20:36.040
Eric, I am talking to you.

20:36.166 --> 20:37.999
Adults so don't get
what's cool anymore.

20:39.083 --> 20:40.374
Sharon! Sharon!

20:40.500 --> 20:41.790
Randy?
What's going on?

20:41.916 --> 20:43.790
They made a hologram of me,
Sharon.

20:43.916 --> 20:46.624
They don't care about the music.
They're replacing us!

20:46.750 --> 20:47.749
Oh, my God.

20:47.875 --> 20:51.207
You mean...
I just slept with a hologram?

20:51.333 --> 20:53.124
The hologram's
in our bedroom?

20:53.250 --> 20:54.124
Yes!

20:55.916 --> 20:58.415
A'ight.
I got to be leaving now, Sharon.

20:58.541 --> 21:03.124
I would leave you my number, but
I'm just a hologram and shit.

21:04.375 --> 21:06.499
You slept with Tupac?!

21:06.625 --> 21:08.165
Sharon!

21:10.791 --> 21:12.624
It's a brave new world.

21:12.750 --> 21:15.374
Starting much sooner
than we thought.

21:15.500 --> 21:17.624
What we need is someone
who truly gets

21:17.750 --> 21:19.165
the changing of the guard.

21:19.291 --> 21:20.999
We have an army of holograms

21:21.125 --> 21:24.790
poised to start the next chapter
in American culture.

21:24.916 --> 21:27.915
How would you like to be
in charge of it all?

21:28.041 --> 21:29.457
Oh, totally, brah.

21:29.583 --> 21:31.415
So sweet.
Being in charge of stuff rules.

21:31.541 --> 21:33.249
Cartmanbrah!

21:33.375 --> 21:34.915
Glad you feel that way.

21:35.041 --> 21:36.915
We have
a lot to do together.

21:37.041 --> 21:40.165
We're about to take this
to a whole new level.

21:40.291 --> 21:42.124
Oh, I love whole new levels!

21:42.250 --> 21:43.582
This is gonna be
so totally awesome!

21:43.708 --> 21:45.582
Cartmanbrah!
