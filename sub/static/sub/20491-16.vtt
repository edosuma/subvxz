00:38.033 --> 00:39.300
THERE HE IS.

00:45.167 --> 00:48.934
 WE NEED TO TALK --
 PRIVATELY.

00:51.067 --> 00:52.601
ALRIGHT.

00:52.701 --> 00:56.234
NOW, CAN YOU EXPLAIN THIS CLOAK
AND DAGGER MYSTERY TO ME?

00:56.334 --> 00:59.400
  I GOT A TIP SOMETHING
  BIG'S GONNA GO DOWN.

00:59.501 --> 01:01.234
 THERE'S A GROUP
 ABOUT TO RESURRECT

01:01.334 --> 01:03.968
 AN OLD MILITARY EXPERIMENT
 THAT WAS TERMINATED YEARS AGO.

01:04.066 --> 01:05.266
HOW OLD ARE WE TALKING?

01:05.367 --> 01:08.501
  1943.

01:09.434 --> 01:10.534
HOW'D YOU HEAR ABOUT THIS?

01:10.634 --> 01:12.300
THE DOMINION?

01:13.701 --> 01:15.067
NO?

01:15.167 --> 01:16.667
THEN WHO?

01:16.767 --> 01:18.267
  LOOK, I KNOW THIS IS
  GOING TO SOUND CRAZY,

01:18.367 --> 01:20.033
  BUT I CAN'T TELL YOU.

01:20.133 --> 01:23.067
 I GAVE MY WORD.

01:23.167 --> 01:25.701
WHY'D YOU DRAG ME DOWN HERE
AND NOT BRENNAN?

01:25.801 --> 01:27.200
 BECAUSE, JESS, WHATEVER'S
 ABOUT TO HAPPEN...

01:27.300 --> 01:29.634
  CONCERNS YOU.

01:37.534 --> 01:47.400
  <grunting/panting>

01:47.501 --> 01:49.734
 <shot fired>

01:59.033 --> 02:01.267
 WHAT DID YOU DO TO ME?

02:01.367 --> 02:02.400
LEAVE HIM ALONE!

02:02.501 --> 02:07.601
 <shots fired>

02:10.366 --> 02:13.100
 <shots fired>

02:23.033 --> 02:25.334
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, BUDDY?

02:29.801 --> 02:30.801
WHAT HAPPENED?

02:30.901 --> 02:33.234
HE WAS YOUNG.

02:33.334 --> 02:35.601
THAT'S THE TOMCATS.

02:41.434 --> 02:46.033
  <i>SCIENTIST ADAM KANE WAS A
  <i>PIONEER OF GENETIC RESEARCH,</i></i>

02:46.133 --> 02:49.934
  <i>MANIPULATING DNA TO
  <i>SAVE HUMAN LIVES.</i></i>

02:50.033 --> 02:53.467
  <i>BUT IN MANY, THEIR GENES
  <i>UNEXPECTEDLY MUTATED</i></i>

02:53.567 --> 02:57.267
  <i>AND THEY DEVELOPED
  <i>SUPERHUMAN ABILITIES.</i></i>

03:26.200 --> 03:28.667
  <i>TOGETHER, FOUR OF THE MOST
  <i>POWERFUL FIGHT</i></i>

03:28.767 --> 03:32.234
 <i>TO PROTECT A WORLD THAT DOESN'T
 <i>EVEN KNOW THEY EXIST.</i></i>

03:34.367 --> 03:37.968
  <i>THEY ARE... MUTANT X.</i>

03:42.467 --> 03:44.067
  HIS NAME WAS
  PETER HANSON.

03:44.167 --> 03:46.534
HE WAS A NAVAL FIGHTER PILOT
IN A UNIT CALLED THE TOMCATS

03:46.634 --> 03:47.901
IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.834
 SO HE WASN'T YOUNG.

03:49.934 --> 03:52.467
  THAT'S WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE
  WHEN WE FIRST SAW HIM.

03:55.234 --> 03:56.334
 WHAT IS IT?

03:56.434 --> 03:59.501
COME ON -- THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU'RE NOT TELLING.

03:59.601 --> 04:01.667
 LEXA, WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

04:01.767 --> 04:02.834
OKAY.

04:02.934 --> 04:04.601
I HEARD A RUMOUR THAT BACK
DURING WORLD WAR II

04:04.701 --> 04:08.267
THE MILITARY LED A SERIES OF
COVERT ANTI-AGING EXPERIMENTS.

04:08.367 --> 04:10.567
AND ONCE THE DOMINION HEARD
ABOUT IT THEY SHUT IT DOWN.

04:10.667 --> 04:11.801
 AND...?

04:11.901 --> 04:12.734
THAT'S IT.

04:12.834 --> 04:13.868
THAT'S ALL I KNOW.

04:13.968 --> 04:15.734
IT'S THE TRUTH.

04:15.834 --> 04:16.901
HEY, WHAT'S WITH YOU?

04:17.000 --> 04:19.934
I MEAN, YOU SEEM TO BE
TAKING THIS SO PERSONALLY.

04:20.033 --> 04:22.067
 IT IS.

04:22.167 --> 04:25.167
 MY GRANDFATHER WAS A
 MEMBER OF THE TOMCATS UNIT.

04:25.267 --> 04:26.267
REALLY?

04:26.367 --> 04:27.801
  YEAH.

04:27.901 --> 04:29.267
THEY GAVE HIM THE
MEDAL OF HONOR

04:29.367 --> 04:31.834
 AFTER HE LED SEVEN ATTACKS
 OFF MALAITA ISLAND.

04:31.934 --> 04:34.234
  HIS PLANE WAS HIT BY ENEMY
  FIRE, BUT HE SURVIVED.

04:34.334 --> 04:36.033
 HE SPENT HALF THE NIGHT IN
 SHARK-INFESTED WATERS

04:36.133 --> 04:37.901
 BEFORE HE MADE
 IT TO SHORE.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.234
HUH. WOW.

04:39.334 --> 04:40.834
HE SOUNDS LIKE
QUITE THE WAR HERO.

04:40.934 --> 04:41.968
 YEAH, HE WAS...

04:42.067 --> 04:43.901
 OR IS.

04:44.033 --> 04:45.934
 SO NOW YOU KNOW
 WHY I NEED ANSWERS.

04:46.033 --> 04:47.067
YEAH.

04:47.167 --> 04:48.400
WELL, I'LL SEE
WHAT I CAN DO.

04:48.501 --> 04:49.801
 THANK YOU.

04:49.901 --> 04:52.434
UNTIL THEN, MAYBE IT'S TIME TO
CHECK IN WITH YOUR GRANDPA.

04:52.534 --> 04:58.100
 UH, MY GRANDPA AND PA HAD A
 FALLING OUT WHEN I WAS YOUNGER.

04:58.200 --> 05:00.834
 I DON'T EVEN KNOW
 WHERE TO START LOOKING.

05:01.968 --> 05:05.367
WELL, MAYBE
IT'S TIME YOU TRIED.

05:17.601 --> 05:19.467
  ABSOLUTELY
  REMARKABLE.

05:19.567 --> 05:22.000
 ALTHOUGH ALL OUTWARD PHYSICAL
 SIGNS SEEM TO INDICATE

05:22.100 --> 05:25.267
 THAT THE SPECIMEN IS BETWEEN
 80 AND 85 YEARS OF AGE,

05:25.367 --> 05:30.467
HIS INTERNAL ORGANS ARE THOSE OF
A HEALTHY 30-YEAR-OLD MALE.

05:30.567 --> 05:32.467
HOW'S THAT
POSSIBLE?

05:32.567 --> 05:35.601
HOW CAN SOMEONE AGE FIFTY
YEARS WITHIN A FEW SECONDS?

05:35.701 --> 05:39.634
 I'M AFRAID I WON'T KNOW
 MORE UNTIL I BIOPSY THE
 TISSUE SAMPLES.

05:39.734 --> 05:41.767
DOC, IS IT POSSIBLE TO
REVERSE THE AGING PROCESS

05:41.868 --> 05:43.801
 THROUGH GENETIC
 MANIPULATION?

05:43.901 --> 05:45.934
 WELL, SO FAR, SCIENCE HAS
 LOOKED FOR WAYS TO EXTEND LIFE

05:46.033 --> 05:49.501
 AS OPPOSED TO TRYING TO
 RESET THE BIOLOGICAL CLOCK.

05:49.601 --> 05:51.767
WHAT ARE WE TALKING
ABOUT HERE, DOC?

05:51.868 --> 05:53.234
FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH?

05:53.334 --> 05:54.701
 NOT EXACTLY.

05:54.801 --> 05:57.834
 THE CATALYST USED TO SET BACK
 HIS CLOCK IS ONLY TEMPORARY.

05:57.934 --> 06:00.100
  HE REPRESENTS A
  WORK IN PROGRESS.

06:00.200 --> 06:01.767
 I GUESS WHOEVER'S
 RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS

06:01.868 --> 06:05.767
 IS TRYING TO FIND A NEW WAY TO
 SAY, "LIFE BEGINS AT EIGHTY."

06:05.868 --> 06:09.000
 HOW COULD YOU IDIOTS
 HAVE LET HANSEN ESCAPE?

06:09.100 --> 06:12.901
THIS MAN REPRESENTED
THE CULMINATION OF A
LIFETIME OF RESEARCH.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.467
THERE WAS NO WAY OF
ANTICIPATING HOW QUICKLY
HIS CELLS WOULD REGENERATE.

06:16.567 --> 06:18.467
HANSEN CAUGHT
OUR MEN OFF GUARD.

06:18.567 --> 06:20.400
 THE MAN WAS
 COMBAT TRAINED.

06:20.501 --> 06:22.334
WHEN HE WOKE UP HALF
A CENTURY YOUNGER,

06:22.434 --> 06:24.300
 WHAT DID YOU
 EXPECT HE WOULD DO?

06:24.400 --> 06:26.234
SIR, THE GOOD NEWS IS THE
SIRTUIN STIMULATORS

06:26.334 --> 06:28.667
WERE SUCCESSFUL IN EFFECTING
CELL REJUVENATION.

06:28.767 --> 06:30.534
BUT ONLY FOR
A FEW HOURS.

06:30.634 --> 06:35.367
HANSEN'S FREE RADICALS
QUICKLY BECAME UNSTABLE.

06:35.467 --> 06:37.701
NEVERTHELESS, THIS IS THE
BIGGEST BREAKTHROUGH

06:37.801 --> 06:39.334
WE'VE HAD SO FAR.

06:39.434 --> 06:41.601
I'M SURE WITH TIME WE CAN
SUSTAIN THE REACTION.

06:41.701 --> 06:43.801
 TAKE A GOOD
 LOOK AT ME, DOCTOR.

06:43.901 --> 06:47.467
 I'M NOT EXACTLY IN
 THE PRIME OF MY LIFE.

06:47.567 --> 06:51.133
 TIME IS NOT
 ON MY SIDE.

06:51.234 --> 06:53.400
THEN WITH YOUR PERMISSION
I'D LIKE TO MOVE FORWARD

06:53.501 --> 06:57.400
ON TESTING THE FINAL
SUBJECT IMMEDIATELY.

06:57.501 --> 06:59.901
 DO IT.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.367
THANK YOU,
COLONEL.

07:04.801 --> 07:07.801
HAS KILMARTIN HAD ANY SUCCESS
IN LOCATING HIS GRANDFATHER?

07:07.901 --> 07:09.200
NO, NOT YET.

07:09.300 --> 07:11.534
SO I ASSUME HE WAS PART OF
THE ORIGINAL EXPERIMENT.

07:11.634 --> 07:13.501
IT WAS KNOWN
AS OPERATION IMMORTALIS,

07:13.601 --> 07:15.601
LED BY COLONEL
HENRY BURNS.

07:15.701 --> 07:18.067
THE PROJECT WAS CLOAKED BY THE
MILITARY AS A NEW TREATMENT

07:18.167 --> 07:20.934
TO COUNTERACT TUBERCULOSIS.

07:21.033 --> 07:22.534
 BUT...

07:22.634 --> 07:25.400
THEY USED THE MEN OF THE TOMCATS
UNIT AS HUMAN GUINEA PIGS?

07:25.501 --> 07:27.067
I'M AFRAID SO.

07:27.167 --> 07:30.200
AFTER WE SHUT IT
DOWN, BURNS ESCAPED.

07:30.300 --> 07:32.567
WELL, WHAT BECAME OF
HIS RESEARCH THEN?

07:32.667 --> 07:35.467
IT WAS DESTROYED DURING
THE ATOMIC BOMB TESTING

07:35.567 --> 07:37.567
OVER THE BIKINI ATOLL.

07:37.667 --> 07:40.334
SINCE THEN, BURNS HAS MANAGED
TO STAY UNDER THE RADAR.

07:40.434 --> 07:42.534
YEAH, UNTIL NOW.

07:42.634 --> 07:43.968
WHAT WAS DONE TO
THE MEN BACK THEN

07:44.067 --> 07:47.033
REPRESENTS ONLY THE FIRST
STAGE IN THE EXPERIMENT.

07:47.133 --> 07:49.167
WE BELIEVE BURNS HAS
FINALLY RESURFACED

07:49.267 --> 07:50.968
TO FINISH WHAT
HE'S STARTED.

07:51.067 --> 07:52.267
YEAH, BUT
WAIT A MINUTE --

07:52.367 --> 07:53.634
THIS STUDY WAS DONE
OVER SIXTY YEARS AGO.

07:53.734 --> 07:55.667
 HOW MANY OF THESE
 MEN ARE STILL AROUND?

07:55.767 --> 07:57.901
ONE.

08:15.601 --> 08:18.434
  COME ON. I DON'T HAVE
  TIME FOR THIS.

08:19.767 --> 08:22.367
 <i>JESSE, YOU HAVE TO
 <i>LISTEN TO ME CAREFULLY.</i></i>

08:22.467 --> 08:24.267
 <i>YOUR GRANDFATHER'S
 <i>IN DANGER.</i></i>

08:24.367 --> 08:26.501
WHO IS THIS?

08:29.901 --> 08:32.067
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO
TIPPED OFF SHALIMAR.

08:32.167 --> 08:33.100
 <i>YES.</i>

08:33.200 --> 08:34.267
 <i>YOU'LL FIND
 <i>YOUR GRANDFATHER</i></i>

08:34.366 --> 08:36.734
 <i>AT THE CLARKPORT
 <i>VETERAN'S HOSPITAL.</i></i>

08:36.833 --> 08:38.267
 <i>YOU NEED TO GO NOW.</i>

08:38.366 --> 08:40.601
  WHY? WHAT'S GOING ON?

08:46.601 --> 08:47.801
GUYS, I NEED
YOUR HELP.

08:47.901 --> 08:48.834
I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH
TIME TO EXPLAIN.

08:48.934 --> 08:50.734
BUT I GOTTA GO
GET MY GRANDDAD.

08:50.834 --> 08:51.801
WHAT'S THE BIG RUSH?

08:51.901 --> 08:54.334
GUESS HE'LL FILL
US IN ON THE WAY.

09:00.067 --> 09:01.501
  I CAN'T TELL
  YOU ANYTHING NOW.

09:01.601 --> 09:03.834
  JUST DROP ME OFF AND WAIT.

09:58.934 --> 09:59.767
 IT'S GALLANT.

09:59.868 --> 10:01.100
HE'S GOOD TO GO.

10:01.200 --> 10:02.634
 MEET ME AT THE
 NORTH ELEVATOR.

10:02.734 --> 10:06.934
  AND I WANT KILMARTIN READY
  FOR TRANSFER IMMEDIATELY.

10:29.200 --> 10:32.200
GRANDPA?

10:51.200 --> 10:52.434
 GRANDPA,
 IT'S ME, JESSE.

10:52.534 --> 10:54.801
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

11:00.000 --> 11:01.567
JESSE?

11:01.667 --> 11:03.667
  YEAH.

11:05.467 --> 11:06.934
IS IT REALLY YOU?

11:07.033 --> 11:09.534
  YEAH.

11:19.334 --> 11:23.400
 HE'S IN THE ADVANCED STAGES
 OF LYMPHATIC CANCER, JESSE.

11:23.501 --> 11:29.434
ADAM, WHAT THE HELL
-- YOU'RE DEAD.

11:29.534 --> 11:32.000
I NEEDED YOU
TO BELIEVE THAT.

11:32.100 --> 11:34.667
SINCE THE EXPLOSION
I'VE BEEN IN HIDING.

11:34.767 --> 11:36.767
 BUT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT
 YOU KEEP THAT A SECRET.

11:36.868 --> 11:38.467
 MY ENEMIES
 ARE EVERYWHERE.

11:38.567 --> 11:39.934
WELL, I...

11:40.033 --> 11:41.267
 I'M SURE YOU HAVE A
 MILLION QUESTIONS.

11:41.367 --> 11:42.801
  RIGHT NOW
  THERE ISN'T TIME.

11:42.901 --> 11:44.133
  YOU HAVE TO TRUST ME.

11:44.234 --> 11:45.501
TRUST YOU?

11:45.601 --> 11:47.000
ADAM, YOU'VE BEEN LYING
TO ME FOR A YEAR,

11:47.100 --> 11:48.467
AND NOW YOU WANT
ME TO TRUST YOU?

11:48.567 --> 11:49.667
 THIS ISN'T
 ABOUT US.

11:49.767 --> 11:51.434
 THIS IS ABOUT
 YOUR GRANDFATHER.

11:51.534 --> 11:53.300
YOU HAVE TO GET
HIM OUT OF HERE.

11:55.367 --> 11:59.133
  HIS METABOLISM IS ALREADY
  STARTING TO REVERSE.

12:01.267 --> 12:02.801
 WHAT HAVE THEY
 DONE TO HIM?

12:02.901 --> 12:04.934
 HE'S BEEN GIVEN AN
 EXPERIMENTAL SERUM.

12:05.033 --> 12:06.534
RIGHT NOW THERE ARE GUYS
ON THEIR WAY UP HERE

12:06.634 --> 12:07.701
TO TRANSFER HIM.

12:07.801 --> 12:09.367
SO YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO FIND ANOTHER WAY OUT.

12:09.467 --> 12:11.567
JESS. QUICK!

12:11.667 --> 12:13.400
  YOU HAVE TO MOVE <i>NOW.</i>

12:26.601 --> 12:28.434
HEY, GUYS,
LISTEN CAREFULLY.

12:28.534 --> 12:31.067
  <i>I NEED YOU TO PULL THE DOUBLE
  <i>HELIX UP TO THE WINDOW,</i></i>

12:31.167 --> 12:34.100
 THE SOUTH SIDE,
 TOP FLOOR.

12:34.200 --> 12:35.567
   <i>DO YOU UNDERSTAND?</i>

12:35.667 --> 12:36.834
YEAH.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

12:36.934 --> 12:39.801
JUST DO IT, OKAY?

12:39.901 --> 12:41.868
OKAY.

12:47.834 --> 12:51.100
COME ON. COME ON.

12:51.200 --> 12:53.534
 ALL RIGHT...

12:54.701 --> 12:56.667
 OKAY.

13:05.834 --> 13:06.968
WILLIAM?

13:07.067 --> 13:10.367
WHERE ARE YOU TAKING
MR. KILMARTIN?

13:10.467 --> 13:11.467
STOP HIM!

13:11.567 --> 13:13.567
 BRENNAN, TELL ME
 YOU'RE IN POSITION.

13:13.667 --> 13:14.701
 ALMOST.

13:14.801 --> 13:17.234
 ALMOST BETTER
 BE GOOD ENOUGH.

13:18.934 --> 13:21.634
WHAT'S GOING ON?

13:25.334 --> 13:27.300
 UGH...!

13:29.033 --> 13:30.167
OH, MY GOD!

13:30.267 --> 13:31.667
GUYS, GO!

13:33.634 --> 13:35.100
WHAT'S GOING ON?

13:35.200 --> 13:37.901
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING
AT ME LIKE THAT FOR?

13:38.033 --> 13:39.334
  WHERE ARE WE?

13:39.434 --> 13:40.133
IT'S OKAY.

13:40.234 --> 13:41.567
YOU'RE GOING
TO BE SAFE.

13:41.667 --> 13:43.033
 JESS?

13:43.133 --> 13:45.667
UH, THIS IS
MY GRANDFATHER.

13:56.400 --> 13:58.734
  DOES HE HAVE ANY IDEA
  WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?

13:58.834 --> 13:59.834
I DON'T KNOW.

13:59.934 --> 14:02.234
JESSE BARELY GOT
OUT WITH HIM ALIVE.

14:02.334 --> 14:03.400
YEAH, WELL, ACCORDING
TO HIS MEDICAL FILE

14:03.501 --> 14:07.033
 HE WAS BEING TREATED
 FOR LYMPHATIC CANCER.

14:07.133 --> 14:09.501
 MUST BE SOME
 POWERFUL MEDICATION.

14:09.601 --> 14:11.067
 LOOKS PRETTY
 DAMNED GOOD TO ME.

14:11.167 --> 14:12.334
  YEAH, NO KIDDING.

14:12.434 --> 14:13.734
 THE TWO OF THEM COULD
 PASS FOR BROTHERS.

14:13.834 --> 14:15.234
  YOU KNOW, I STILL
  THINK DR. SAUNDERS

14:15.334 --> 14:16.367
SHOULD CHECK HIM OUT,

14:16.467 --> 14:18.968
SEE IF HE REALLY IS
AS GOOD AS HE LOOKS.

14:21.767 --> 14:24.667
WELL, GOD BLESS AMERICA.

14:28.934 --> 14:30.033
 FOR THE FIRST
 TIME IN MY LIFE

14:30.133 --> 14:32.934
I DON'T MIND BEING
USED AS A LAB RAT.

14:33.033 --> 14:35.934
 WELL, WHO DO I HAVE
 TO THANK FOR THIS...

14:36.033 --> 14:37.634
  NEW LEASE ON LIFE?

14:37.734 --> 14:38.934
WELL, RIGHT NOW WE
DON'T KNOW, GRANDPA,

14:39.033 --> 14:40.601
 BUT WE'RE WORKING ON THAT.

14:41.801 --> 14:43.133
AND LOOK AT YOU.

14:43.234 --> 14:44.133
HAH!

14:44.234 --> 14:45.467
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

14:45.567 --> 14:48.067
OH, THE LAST TIME I
SAW YOU, YOU WERE...

14:48.167 --> 14:49.667
SIX YEARS OLD.

14:49.767 --> 14:51.200
TEN.

14:51.300 --> 14:52.667
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

14:52.767 --> 14:54.868
YOUR MOTHER BROUGHT YOU BY
TO TALK TO ME ABOUT A...

14:54.968 --> 14:57.567
A REPORT YOU WERE WRITING
FOR YOUR HISTORY CLASS.

14:57.667 --> 14:59.501
  YEAH.

14:59.601 --> 15:01.133
 THAT WAS A PRETTY BIG DEAL.

15:01.234 --> 15:04.667
  NOT EVERY KID'S GOT A WAR
  HERO AS A GRANDDAD, YOU KNOW?

15:04.767 --> 15:06.434
AGH...

15:06.534 --> 15:08.067
AND YOU WERE EVEN GOING
TO COME TALK TO MY CLASS

15:08.167 --> 15:10.400
UNTIL DAD MADE YOU BACK OUT.

15:10.501 --> 15:12.300
UH HUH.

15:12.400 --> 15:14.067
BUT WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO, KID?

15:14.167 --> 15:16.801
IT'S WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE.

15:16.901 --> 15:18.667
 MR. KILMARTIN?

15:18.767 --> 15:20.300
 LEXA PIERCE.

15:20.400 --> 15:22.000
  WELL, HELLO, THERE, MISSY.

15:22.100 --> 15:23.467
<laughs>

15:23.567 --> 15:25.767
 YOU MUST WORK
 FOR MY GRANDSON HERE.

15:25.868 --> 15:26.734
 WELL, UH...

15:26.834 --> 15:27.767
THAT'S RIGHT.

15:27.868 --> 15:29.334
I DO.

15:29.434 --> 15:30.968
 HUH.

15:31.067 --> 15:32.267
WELL, THAT'S A...

15:32.367 --> 15:33.934
 THAT'S A PRETTY FANCY
 PLANE YOU GOT THERE.

15:34.033 --> 15:36.300
 WHAT ARE YOU PACKING
 IN THAT BAD BOY?

15:36.400 --> 15:37.634
TWIN SPOOL TURBOJETS.

15:37.734 --> 15:38.567
 NIFTY.

15:38.667 --> 15:39.934
  I READ ABOUT THOSE.

15:40.033 --> 15:42.634
  YEAH, MY GRANDDAD WAS
  TRAINED AT PRESIDIO.

15:42.734 --> 15:44.634
WELL, THAT'S
PRETTY IMPRESSIVE.

15:44.734 --> 15:46.267
NOW, I HEARD YOU COULD
FLY UNDER BRIDGES

15:46.367 --> 15:48.100
AND BLOW WASH
OFF CLOTHESLINES?

15:48.200 --> 15:49.133
 YEAH, WELL...

15:49.234 --> 15:50.567
 <laughs>
 TELL HER. TELL HER.

15:50.667 --> 15:53.267
YEAH, WELL, I PISSED OFF A
LOT OF HOUSEWIVES IN MY DAY.

15:53.367 --> 15:55.868
 NOT TO MENTION A FEW HUSBANDS.

15:55.968 --> 15:58.067
LISTEN, MR. KILMARTIN, JUST TO
BE ON THE SAFE SIDE, YOU KNOW,

15:58.167 --> 16:00.234
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ONE OF OUR
DOCTORS COME AND CHECK YOU OUT.

16:00.334 --> 16:01.734
ARE YOU KIDDING?

16:01.834 --> 16:03.400
 I FEEL LIKE A NEW MAN.

16:03.501 --> 16:05.834
I COULD DANCE ALL NIGHT.

16:05.934 --> 16:07.167
DARLIN'?

16:07.267 --> 16:08.534
  HM?

16:08.634 --> 16:09.467
OH.

16:09.567 --> 16:17.734
 <humming <i>In The Mood ></i>

16:17.834 --> 16:21.000
 I'M GONNA GET YOU
 SOME CLOTHES, GRAMPS.

16:21.100 --> 16:22.634
OH, YEAH.

16:22.734 --> 16:24.834
 I THOUGHT IT WAS A
 LITTLE DRAFTY IN HERE.

16:24.934 --> 16:27.100
 THANKS, PALLIE.

16:29.267 --> 16:31.000
  WELL, NOW, I HATE TO BREAK
  IT TO YOU, DARLIN',

16:31.100 --> 16:33.400
BUT THIS FLYBOY'S
SPOKEN FOR.

16:33.501 --> 16:35.534
 WHEN MY GAL BACK HOME
 GETS A LOAD OF ME...

16:35.634 --> 16:38.734
 <laughs>
 SHE'S GONNA PASS OUT.

16:38.834 --> 16:40.400
 AH HA!

16:40.501 --> 16:41.901
 YEAH.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.467
 DAMN!

16:43.567 --> 16:47.367
  <hum>

16:47.467 --> 16:49.934
JESSE.

16:50.033 --> 16:51.901
  WELL, WELL, WELL.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.634
THIS GOING TO BE
A REGULAR THING?

16:53.734 --> 16:55.501
MAYBE.

16:55.601 --> 16:58.267
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

16:58.367 --> 16:59.567
HOW'S YOUR GRANDFATHER?

16:59.667 --> 17:00.968
 PRETTY AMAZING.

17:01.067 --> 17:04.367
 SOMEHOW, I SUSPECT THAT
 YOU ALREADY KNEW THAT.

17:04.467 --> 17:07.534
 NOW, WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT?

17:07.634 --> 17:12.334
IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT YOU FIND
BURNS AND DESTROY HIS RESEARCH.

17:12.434 --> 17:14.166
WHY?

17:14.267 --> 17:16.334
 HOW IS ANY OF
 THIS A BAD THING?

17:16.434 --> 17:19.334
YOU'LL SEE WHEN YOU FIND THE
FILES ON OPERATION IMMORTALIS.

17:19.434 --> 17:21.567
 ACCORDING TO LEXA THOSE
 FILES DON'T EXIST.

17:21.666 --> 17:23.501
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

17:23.601 --> 17:25.434
AND YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE
WHO'S LOOKING FOR THOSE FILES,

17:25.534 --> 17:28.601
SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT
YOU FIND THEM FIRST.

17:28.701 --> 17:30.801
HOW?

17:33.534 --> 17:35.000
 WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO?

17:35.100 --> 17:36.868
UH, NO ONE.

17:36.968 --> 17:38.400
 WELL, LEXA'S READY FOR
 DR. SAUNDERS

17:38.501 --> 17:39.868
 TO GIVE GRANDPAPPY
 THE OLD ONCE-OVER,

17:39.968 --> 17:41.634
 IF YOU WANT TO
 CHECK IT OUT.

17:41.734 --> 17:43.100
YEAH. THANKS.

17:43.200 --> 17:45.234
LISTEN, WHILE
WE'RE AWAY,

17:45.334 --> 17:46.601
SEE IF YOU
CAN FIND OUT

17:46.701 --> 17:48.968
WHERE THE FILES ON OPERATION
IMMORTALIS ARE BEING KEPT.

17:49.067 --> 17:50.634
 THOUGHT THEY
 WERE DESTROYED.

17:50.734 --> 17:52.868
YEAH.
YOU THOUGHT WRONG.

17:55.100 --> 17:58.033
 NOW, WE HAVE
 LOST KILMARTIN?

17:58.133 --> 17:59.834
I CAN'T EXPLAIN
IT, COLONEL.

17:59.934 --> 18:01.067
THE MAN WHO WAS
WITH KILMARTIN

18:01.167 --> 18:02.868
HAD THE ABILITY TO RUN
RIGHT THROUGH A WALL.

18:02.968 --> 18:05.367
 I SUSPECT IT WAS ONE OF
 THE DOMINION'S PEOPLE.

18:05.467 --> 18:08.767
THEY WERE THE ONES WHO
SHUT ME DOWN BACK IN '43.

18:08.868 --> 18:10.200
 HYPOCRITES.

18:10.300 --> 18:12.667
THE DRUG WAS ALREADY TAKING
EFFECT ON KILMARTIN.

18:12.767 --> 18:14.200
I THINK THIS TIME
WE WERE SUCCESSFUL

18:14.300 --> 18:16.968
IN ACHIEVING COMPLETE
CELLULAR REJUVENATION.

18:17.067 --> 18:18.334
 REALLY?

18:18.434 --> 18:20.234
WOULD YOU BET
YOUR LIFE ON IT?

18:20.334 --> 18:21.667
YES, I WOULD.

18:21.767 --> 18:24.634
 WELL, YOU'LL UNDERSTAND
 IF I'M A LITTLE UNWILLING

18:24.734 --> 18:28.634
  TO EXCEPT YOUR ASSURANCE.

18:28.734 --> 18:31.000
EVEN WITH ALL OUR RESOURCES
TRYING TO LOCATE KILMARTIN,

18:31.100 --> 18:32.734
THERE'S NO GUARANTEE
WILL FIND HIM.

18:32.834 --> 18:34.334
 HE'LL TURN UP.

18:34.434 --> 18:39.067
THE MAN JUST WOKE UP WITH A
WHOLE NEW LIFE AHEAD OF HIM.

18:39.167 --> 18:42.801
 WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

18:54.400 --> 18:58.300
<panting>

18:58.400 --> 18:59.701
OKAY, THAT'S FINE.

18:59.801 --> 19:01.734
 LET ME DO ONE
 MORE MILE.

19:01.834 --> 19:03.400
IT'S NOT A RACE,
WILLIAM.

19:03.501 --> 19:05.467
COME ON, YOU DON'T WANT
TO WEAR YOUR HOT BODY OUT.

19:05.567 --> 19:07.834
 COME ON.
 HOW IS HE?

19:07.934 --> 19:09.601
WELL, YOUR GRANDFATHER'S
BLOOD PRESSURE'S

19:09.701 --> 19:11.400
PROBABLY LOWER
THAN YOURS.

19:11.501 --> 19:12.801
HIS PRELIMINARY TESTS SHOW

19:12.901 --> 19:15.501
THAT HE'S GOT THE PHYSIOLOGY
OF A THIRTY-YEAR-OLD.

19:15.601 --> 19:17.033
 WHAT ABOUT MY CANCER?

19:17.133 --> 19:18.601
BASED UPON YOUR X-RAYS,

19:18.701 --> 19:20.400
THE TUMOURS HAVE
COMPLETELY VANISHED.

19:20.501 --> 19:21.734
I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT.

19:21.834 --> 19:23.167
HEAR THAT, KIDDO?

19:23.267 --> 19:24.934
 I GOT A CLEAN
 BILL OF HEALTH.

19:25.033 --> 19:26.200
WELL, NOT EXACTLY.

19:26.300 --> 19:27.834
I DID FIND SOMETHING
IN YOUR BLOOD WORK

19:27.934 --> 19:29.634
THAT WAS A LITTLE PUZZLING.

19:29.734 --> 19:31.501
THE FREE RADICALS
SEEM TO BE OXIDIZING

19:31.601 --> 19:35.000
AT ABOUT TWICE THE RATE OF A
NORMAL THIRTY-YEAR-OLD'S.

19:35.100 --> 19:35.968
 WAIT A MINUTE.

19:36.067 --> 19:37.501
 YOU LOST ME AFTER PUZZLING.

19:37.601 --> 19:39.267
WELL, OXIDATION
PRODUCES BY-PRODUCTS

19:39.367 --> 19:40.467
CALLED FREE RADICALS.

19:40.567 --> 19:42.067
IT'S HOW WE AGE.

19:42.167 --> 19:45.033
WHEN THIS PROCESS OCCURS IN
METALS IT'S CALLED RUSTING.

19:45.133 --> 19:47.200
 WELL, I DON'T
 FEEL TOO RUSTY.

19:47.300 --> 19:48.934
 IS THIS SOMETHING WE
 SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT?

19:49.033 --> 19:50.234
 IT COULD JUST BE
 HIS METABOLISM

19:50.334 --> 19:52.000
 ADJUSTING TO WHATEVER
 THE ACTIVE AGENT WAS

19:52.100 --> 19:54.701
  THAT STARTED THE PROCESS
  IN THE FIRST PLACE.

19:54.801 --> 19:56.868
 AT THIS POINT, WE STILL DON'T
 EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT IS.

19:56.968 --> 19:58.467
I'M AFRAID NOT.

19:58.567 --> 20:00.067
 WELL, THAT'S ABOUT TO CHANGE.

20:00.167 --> 20:01.801
BRENNAN, DID YOU MANAGE
TO DIG UP ANYTHING

20:01.901 --> 20:03.501
IN THE PROJECT
IMMORTALIS FILES?

20:03.601 --> 20:06.167
 I THINK I FINALLY HIT
 SOME PAYDIRT HERE.

20:06.267 --> 20:08.501
 THE ONLY PROBLEM IS TRYING
 TO GET 'EM OUT OF THERE.

20:08.601 --> 20:10.601
WAIT A MINUTE - THE DOMINION
SAID THEY WERE DESTROYED.

20:10.701 --> 20:11.868
  YEAH.

20:11.968 --> 20:13.133
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

20:13.234 --> 20:14.534
 WELL, THEY'RE STORED AT
 THE MILITARY WAREHOUSE

20:14.634 --> 20:16.400
AT MCLAREN AIR
FORCE BASE.

20:16.501 --> 20:18.934
ANYONE UNAUTHORIZED COMES
WITHIN A MILE OF THAT PLACE,

20:19.033 --> 20:23.834
 GONNA NEED TO MAKE FRIENDS
 WITH A TEAM OF F-16s.

20:23.934 --> 20:25.834
THERE'S GOT TO BE A
WAY ONTO THAT BASE.

20:25.934 --> 20:27.234
 YEAH, BUT HOW?

20:27.334 --> 20:28.267
 I MEAN, THE GUY SAID THIS
 WAREHOUSE IS GUARDED

20:28.367 --> 20:30.167
  LIKE THE ARK OF COVENANT.

20:30.267 --> 20:33.067
 WELL, WHAT YOU NEED
 IS A DIVERSION.

20:43.667 --> 20:45.868
<Lexa whispers> JESSE,
THIS IS A SUICIDE MISSION.

20:45.968 --> 20:47.601
  IT WILL NEVER WORK.

20:48.534 --> 20:49.767
  IT WILL WORK.

20:49.868 --> 20:51.567
TELL HER AS SOON AS WE
ENTERED MILITARY AIRSPACE

20:51.667 --> 20:53.667
THEY STARTED SCRAMBLING
FOR AN AIR ASSAULT.

20:53.767 --> 20:55.033
 DID YOU HEAR THAT?

20:55.133 --> 20:56.701
 <i>YEAH, I KNOW, THAT'S THE
 <i>SUICIDE PART OF THE MISSION.</i></i>

20:56.801 --> 20:58.234
  <laughing>

20:58.334 --> 21:00.767
DON'T YOU WORRY YOUR
PRETTY LITTLE HEAD
ABOUT THAT, SWEETHEART.

21:00.868 --> 21:03.501
WE'RE JUST GOING TO PLAY A
LITTLE GAME OF CHICKEN, IS ALL.

21:03.601 --> 21:04.734
RELAX...

21:04.834 --> 21:07.100
THIS IS GOING TO
BE A PIECE OF CAKE.

21:22.501 --> 21:28.234
 <alarm>

21:28.334 --> 21:30.367
 <pilot>
  <i>UNIDENTIFIED CRAFT...</i>

21:30.467 --> 21:31.667
WELL, WE GOT
THEIR ATTENTION.

21:31.767 --> 21:34.100
GOOD. THIS IS
WHERE IT GETS FUN.

21:34.200 --> 21:41.300
 <alarm>

21:48.067 --> 21:49.167
  LEXA, YOU MOVING?

21:49.267 --> 21:50.167
I DON'T WANT TO PLAY
CHICKEN WITH THESE GUYS

21:50.267 --> 21:51.434
ANY MORE THAN
I HAVE TO.

21:51.534 --> 21:53.067
  I'M ON IT.

21:54.367 --> 21:57.167
 <shot fired>

21:57.267 --> 21:59.501
 WELL, THEY'VE STARTED
 THE FIREWORKS.

22:01.334 --> 22:02.501
YOU GOTTA GET DOWN
LOWER TO LOSE 'EM.

22:02.601 --> 22:04.334
 IF I GO ANY LOWER,
 WE'LL CRASH.

22:04.434 --> 22:05.601
GIVE ME THE STICK.

22:05.701 --> 22:08.767
SON, I USED TO DO THE
MANOEUVRES IN MY SLEEP.

22:08.868 --> 22:11.100
 ALL RIGHT.

22:11.200 --> 22:12.701
OKAY.

22:12.801 --> 22:13.934
HERE WE GO.

22:24.234 --> 22:25.968
AND THERE'S OUR WAY
OUT RIGHT THERE.

22:26.067 --> 22:27.133
THAT BRIDGE?

22:27.234 --> 22:28.667
 WE CAN'T MAKE IT
 UNDER THAT BRIDGE.

22:28.767 --> 22:29.901
COME ON, YOU'RE KIDDING.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.534
WANT TO BET?

22:32.634 --> 22:34.534
 GUYS, I GOT IT.

22:34.634 --> 22:37.200
  LET'S MOVE.

22:43.300 --> 22:44.968
 GRANDPA, THIS IS NOT SOME
 TWIN-PROP AIRPLANE

22:45.067 --> 22:47.167
  YOU CAN JUST KICK
  AROUND. COME ON.

22:47.267 --> 22:48.434
HOLD ON...

22:59.067 --> 23:01.067
WHOO! YOU SMOKED
THOSE TWO!

23:01.167 --> 23:04.133
HA HA! OL' BLUE
EYES IS BACK.

23:04.234 --> 23:05.334
YOU WANT TO TAKE
IT OUT OF HERE?

23:05.434 --> 23:06.601
LIKE YOU HAVE TO ASK.

23:06.701 --> 23:07.767
 BEAUTIFUL.

23:07.868 --> 23:08.868
HOLD ON.

23:08.968 --> 23:11.834
YEEHOO...!

23:11.934 --> 23:14.934
<laughs>

23:18.601 --> 23:19.934
DAMN!

23:20.033 --> 23:22.801
THE LAST TIME I FELT THIS ALIVE
WAS BACK ON OCTOBER 10TH, 1942.

23:22.901 --> 23:24.234
I WAS ON THE CACTUS
FIGHTER COMMAND,

23:24.334 --> 23:25.601
THERE WERE THREE OF
US LEFT IN THE AIR

23:25.701 --> 23:29.100
CIRCLING THIS
JAPANESE DESTROYER...

23:29.200 --> 23:32.200
SOMETHING WRONG
THERE, JESS?

23:32.300 --> 23:34.400
NO, I...

23:34.501 --> 23:37.601
IT'S REALLY GREAT
BEING WITH YOU.

23:37.701 --> 23:39.968
BUT I'VE NEVER UNDERSTOOD
WHY MY DAD KEPT US APART.

23:40.067 --> 23:41.767
OH, DON'T
BLAME HIM, SON.

23:41.868 --> 23:43.901
WHY NOT?

23:44.000 --> 23:46.801
WELL, BECAUSE THE TWO OF US
HAVE BEEN GIVEN A SECOND CHANCE.

23:46.901 --> 23:49.567
 AND YOU CAN'T CHANGE THE PAST.

23:49.667 --> 23:50.534
 JESS?

23:50.634 --> 23:53.000
 CAN I SEE YOU
 FOR A MINUTE?

23:53.100 --> 23:54.701
YEAH, UH...

23:54.801 --> 23:57.467
YEAH, I'LL BE
RIGHT BACK.

24:01.434 --> 24:02.801
 WOW.

24:05.100 --> 24:06.801
 MY GOD,
 WHAT IS THIS?

24:06.901 --> 24:09.400
 RESEARCH PHOTOS
 TAKEN IN 1943,

24:09.501 --> 24:13.200
 DURING THE EXPERIMENTS OF
 OPERATION IMMORTALIS.

24:13.300 --> 24:15.067
THIS RESEARCH READS
LIKE A HORROR NOVEL.

24:15.167 --> 24:17.367
 BURNS WAS TRYING TO
 REVERSE THE AGING PROCESS

24:17.467 --> 24:20.701
BY USING MEMBERS OF THE
TOMCATS AS HUMAN DONORS.

24:20.801 --> 24:22.901
YEAH, AND HE TRIED TO TRANSFUSE
THEIR GENETIC VITALITY

24:23.000 --> 24:25.033
TO OTHERS AS
TEST SUBJECTS.

24:25.133 --> 24:26.767
  YOU KNOW, THE SAD PART --

24:26.868 --> 24:28.634
 HALF THE MEN LOST THEIR
 LIVES IN THIS EXPERIMENT,

24:28.734 --> 24:31.901
AND THEN LATER THEY WERE
ALL LISTED AS MISSING IN ACTION.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.968
 GUESS YOUR GRAMPS WAS ONE
 OF THE LUCKY ONES, EH?

24:34.067 --> 24:37.300
 I HAD NO IDEA WHAT
 THEY WERE DOING TO US.

24:39.667 --> 24:41.901
 W. MCGOWAN...

24:42.000 --> 24:44.701
 MY GOD,
 THAT'S WHITEY MCGOWAN.

24:46.501 --> 24:51.234
 THEY TOLD ME HE WAS SHOT DOWN
 IN A RAID OVER NEW GUINEA.

24:51.334 --> 24:53.934
GRANDPA,
THIS IS NOT YOUR FAULT.

24:54.033 --> 24:55.701
THERE'S NO WAY THAT YOU
COULD'VE KNOWN

24:55.801 --> 24:57.133
WHAT YOU WERE A PART OF.

24:57.234 --> 24:59.167
 YEAH, WELL, THE ONLY REASON
 I'M STILL HERE IS BECAUSE

24:59.267 --> 25:02.033
THAT BASTARD MURDERED
SOMEBODY ELSE IN MY SQUADRON

25:02.133 --> 25:03.968
 INSTEAD OF ME.

25:04.067 --> 25:09.367
 OH...

25:09.467 --> 25:10.601
GRANDPA, ARE
YOU ALL RIGHT?

25:10.701 --> 25:13.133
I'M FINE.
I'M JUST...

25:13.234 --> 25:14.901
 JUST A LITTLE
 DIZZY, IS ALL.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.501
  YOU KNOW I THINK IT WOULD
  BE A GOOD IDEA

25:16.601 --> 25:18.634
 IF WE GOT DR. SAUNDERS TO
 CHECK HIM OUT AGAIN.

25:18.734 --> 25:20.601
  YEAH. WE'LL TAKE
  CARE OF HIM, JESS.

25:20.701 --> 25:22.267
 THANK YOU.

25:28.067 --> 25:29.334
HE'LL BE OKAY.

25:29.434 --> 25:31.200
HE'S JUST A
LITTLE OVERWHELMED.

25:31.300 --> 25:33.334
IT'S A LOT TO GET
OVER, YOU KNOW.

25:33.434 --> 25:35.968
LEXA, THIS ISN'T THE KIND
OF THING YOU GET OVER.

25:36.067 --> 25:37.734
 I'M SORRY,
 BUT I DON'T GET IT.

25:37.834 --> 25:40.367
 IF THE DOMINION IS AS
 POWERFUL AS YOU SAY IT IS,

25:40.467 --> 25:43.067
 THEN WHY DID THEY ALLOW THIS
 EXPERIMENT TO GO ON FOR SO LONG

25:43.167 --> 25:45.067
 BEFORE THEY DECIDED
 TO SHUT IT DOWN?

25:45.167 --> 25:46.267
WELL, MAYBE THEY TRIED.

25:46.367 --> 25:49.901
AND MAYBE WE'LL
NEVER KNOW, WILL WE?

26:03.701 --> 26:05.100
COLONEL, I'M CONCERNED YOUR
HEART WILL GIVE OUT

26:05.200 --> 26:06.601
BEFORE WE FIND KILMARTIN.

26:06.701 --> 26:08.133
MY HEART'LL BE FINE.

26:08.234 --> 26:10.934
WE'VE GOT MEN STAKING OUT
EVERY PLACE HE MIGHT FREQUENT.

26:11.033 --> 26:12.234
HE HASN'T TURNED UP YET.

26:12.334 --> 26:14.133
  PATIENCE.

26:14.234 --> 26:16.701
IT'S MORE PRUDENT, SIR,
AT THIS POINT TO PROCEED.

26:16.801 --> 26:17.701
 NO.

26:17.801 --> 26:20.367
 WE WAIT UNTIL
 WE FIND KILMARTIN.

26:20.467 --> 26:25.200
 I'M NOT INTERESTED IN
 BECOMING THE FINAL LAB RAT.

26:34.267 --> 26:36.300
ADAM, SHOW YOURSELF!

26:38.234 --> 26:41.367
IT'S TIME YOU FILLED
IN SOME BLANKS HERE.

26:41.467 --> 26:44.701
I TOLD YOU YOU WOULD FIND YOUR
ANSWERS IN BURNS'S RESEARCH.

26:44.801 --> 26:46.334
 BURNS.

26:46.434 --> 26:48.601
THE DOMINION LET HIM
ESCAPE, DIDN'T THEY?

26:48.701 --> 26:51.534
  THEY ACTUALLY HOPED THAT HE
  WOULD FINISH WHAT HE STARTED.

26:51.634 --> 26:53.534
WELL, I DON'T HAVE
ANY PROOF, BUT...

26:53.634 --> 26:55.801
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT SOME PEOPLE
WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION

26:55.901 --> 26:57.701
REALIZED THE POTENTIAL
OF THE THERAPY,

26:57.801 --> 26:59.667
SHOULD IT BECOME VIABLE.

26:59.767 --> 27:02.334
WHICH IS WHY IT'S UP TO YOU TO
MAKE SURE THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN,

27:02.434 --> 27:04.667
OR ELSE MORE INNOCENT
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DIE.

27:04.767 --> 27:06.701
AND HOW AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO THAT?

27:06.801 --> 27:08.834
YOU GOTTA FIND BURNS.

27:08.934 --> 27:13.067
YOUR GRANDFATHER'S THE KEY.

27:13.167 --> 27:17.334
  YOU WANT ME TO USE MY
  GRANDFATHER AS BAIT?

27:20.400 --> 27:24.200
I NEVER SAID THIS
WAS GOING TO BE EASY.

27:24.300 --> 27:25.434
I'M SORRY.

27:35.934 --> 27:38.501
 YOU OKAY,
 MR. KILMARTIN?

27:46.601 --> 27:50.834
I JUST DON'T
DESERVE ANY OF THIS.

27:56.100 --> 27:59.100
I HAVE...

27:59.200 --> 28:03.334
I HAVE TOO MANY REGRETS.

28:03.434 --> 28:07.167
I WASN'T THE MAN
I SHOULD'VE BEEN.

28:07.267 --> 28:09.067
WELL, I THINK WISHING
WE COULDA DONE

28:09.167 --> 28:11.000
THINGS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY.

28:11.100 --> 28:13.667
HM, MAYBE SO.

28:13.767 --> 28:19.601
I JUST HOPE IT'S NOT TOO
LATE TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT.

28:21.667 --> 28:25.033
  HEY, SHAL, DR. SAUNDERS WANTS
  TO HAVE A WORD WITH US.

28:26.067 --> 28:27.133
YOU GO AHEAD.

28:27.234 --> 28:29.567
I'LL BE FINE.

28:38.234 --> 28:40.701
MISS PIERCE, WHEN WERE YOU
GOING TO TELL US

28:40.801 --> 28:44.200
ABOUT YOUR LITTLE CAPER ON
MCLARENS AIR FORCE BASE?

28:44.300 --> 28:45.901
 ABOUT THE SAME TIME
 YOU WERE GOING TO COME CLEAN

28:46.000 --> 28:48.400
 ABOUT BURNS'S RESEARCH
 BEING DESTROYED.

28:48.501 --> 28:52.033
WE WANT ALL THE MATERIALS
YOU STOLE FROM THE FACILITY.

28:53.100 --> 28:54.300
 MISSION WAS A BUST.

28:54.400 --> 28:55.868
 COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING.

28:55.968 --> 28:58.100
IN THAT CASE, I WANT YOU TO
USE ALL MEASURES NECESSARY

28:58.200 --> 29:01.033
TO LOCATE BURNS AND
SECURE HIS RESEARCH.

29:01.133 --> 29:03.667
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

29:03.767 --> 29:06.501
 PERFECTLY.

29:06.601 --> 29:07.901
  OKAY, YOU'RE RIGHT.

29:08.000 --> 29:11.133
  SOMETHING DEEPER'S
  DEFINITELY GOING ON HERE.

29:13.033 --> 29:14.701
 HEY.

29:15.767 --> 29:17.300
WILLIAM!

29:20.234 --> 29:21.400
GUYS, WILLIAM'S GONE AWOL.

29:21.501 --> 29:22.634
  WHAT?

29:22.734 --> 29:25.534
DR. SAUNDERS WAS GIVING
US THE RESULT OF HIS EXAM

29:25.634 --> 29:27.334
AND HE TOOK OFF.

29:27.434 --> 29:28.567
JESS, I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO TELL YOU THIS,

29:28.667 --> 29:30.534
BUT YOUR GRANDFATHER'S
CONDITION IS REVERSING.

29:30.634 --> 29:32.734
HE'S STARTING
TO AGE FAST.

29:32.834 --> 29:34.567
 DOES HE KNOW WHAT'S
 HAPPENING TO HIM?

29:34.667 --> 29:36.200
I DON'T THINK SO.

29:36.300 --> 29:38.501
 SO WHERE DID HE GO?

29:55.901 --> 29:59.067
HELLO, DARLIN'.

30:01.901 --> 30:04.000
IT'S ME.

30:04.100 --> 30:04.901
IT CAN'T BE.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.667
 IT'S IMPOSSIBLE...

30:06.767 --> 30:07.734
YOU'RE NOT DREAMING.

30:07.834 --> 30:09.167
THIS IS REAL.

30:09.267 --> 30:10.167
  IT...

30:10.267 --> 30:12.067
  IT'S NOT NATURAL.

30:12.167 --> 30:13.267
 IT'S NOT RIGHT.

30:13.367 --> 30:14.601
PATTY...

30:14.701 --> 30:16.334
I GOTTA TALK TO YOU
ABOUT SOMETHING.

30:16.434 --> 30:17.133
ALL RIGHT?

30:17.234 --> 30:18.400
 NO, DON'T TOUCH ME.

30:18.501 --> 30:19.734
PATTY...?

30:19.834 --> 30:21.434
 PLEASE...
 OH, JUST...

30:21.534 --> 30:22.200
DARLIN'...

30:22.300 --> 30:23.467
  JUST GO AWAY!

30:23.567 --> 30:26.200
DARLIN' ... DARLIN', I
JUST GOTTA SAY GOODBYE.

30:26.300 --> 30:29.901
  WHY, MR. KILMARTIN, COLONEL
  BURNS HAS BEEN EXPECTING YOU.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.234
  EASY, BOYS!

30:31.334 --> 30:32.167
 EASY.

30:32.267 --> 30:33.701
 EASY...

30:33.801 --> 30:35.868
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE 'IM.

30:35.968 --> 30:37.968
 WE GOT A LOT TO CATCH UP ON.

30:47.200 --> 30:49.467
  ADAM, NOW IS <i>NOT THE TIME
  TO BE HOLDING OUT ON ME.</i>

30:49.567 --> 30:51.033
 EITHER HELP ME
 FIND MY GRANDFATHER

30:51.133 --> 30:53.400
 OR GET THE HELL
 OUT OF HERE.

30:53.501 --> 30:54.934
I'M GUESSING THAT
WHEREVER HE WENT

30:55.033 --> 30:57.567
BURNS'S MEN WERE
WAITING FOR HIM.

30:57.667 --> 30:59.200
 WHAT ARE THEY
 GOING TO DO TO HIM?

30:59.300 --> 31:01.133
WELL, THEY HAVE TO DETERMINE
HOW EFFECTIVE THE SERUM WAS

31:01.234 --> 31:03.334
IN SUSTAINING
THE AGE REVERSAL.

31:03.434 --> 31:04.567
 LOOK, ACCORDING
 TO OUR DOCTOR

31:04.667 --> 31:08.000
  HE'S ALREADY
  BEGINNING TO REGRESS.

31:08.100 --> 31:09.901
 WHAT? THAT'S NOT TRUE?

31:10.000 --> 31:11.767
COME ON, ADAM. YOU
KNOW SOMETHING HERE.

31:11.868 --> 31:12.801
 HE'S NOT DYING, IS HE?

31:12.901 --> 31:13.868
 IS HE?

31:13.968 --> 31:16.267
JESSE, THERE ARE
NO GUARANTEES HERE.

31:16.367 --> 31:19.300
BUT IT'S UP TO YOU TO MAKE SURE
THAT BURNS DOESN'T SUCCEED.

31:19.400 --> 31:20.701
WHY?

31:20.801 --> 31:25.133
BECAUSE HIS DISCOVERY COMES AT
THE COST OF INNOCENT HUMAN LIFE.

31:25.234 --> 31:26.934
  FINE.

31:27.033 --> 31:28.267
YOU HELP ME FIND
MY GRANDFATHER

31:28.367 --> 31:30.367
AND I WILL MAKE SURE
THAT THAT NEVER HAPPENS.

31:30.467 --> 31:31.267
NO.

31:31.367 --> 31:32.701
YOU CANNOT HAVE IT BOTH WAYS.

31:32.801 --> 31:34.434
EVEN IF YOU DESTROY
BURNS'S RESEARCH,

31:34.534 --> 31:36.734
THERE ARE OTHERS
OUT THERE WHO ARE GOING
TO USE YOUR GRANDFATHER

31:36.834 --> 31:39.234
TO REVERSE ENGINEER
THE PROCESS.

31:39.334 --> 31:41.767
  ADAM, WHAT DO YOU
  EXPECT ME TO DO?

31:41.868 --> 31:44.133
DO YOU EXPECT ME
TO LET HIM DIE?

31:44.234 --> 31:45.167
HUH?

31:45.267 --> 31:49.200
I'M EXPECTING YOU TO
DO THE RIGHT THING.

31:49.300 --> 31:56.234
MY GOD, IT'S AS IF HE'S BEEN
TRANSPORTED BACK FROM 1943.

31:56.334 --> 31:59.434
AND HOW MANY OF OUR MEN
DID YOU MURDER TO DO THIS?

31:59.534 --> 32:01.567
  WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?

32:01.667 --> 32:04.734
 THE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF A
 FIGHTER PILOT IN THOSE DAYS

32:04.834 --> 32:06.601
  WAS LESS THAN A YEAR.

32:06.701 --> 32:08.701
BUT THEY WERE WILLING TO DIE
FOR THEIR COUNTRY --

32:08.801 --> 32:10.167
NOT FOR YOU.

32:10.267 --> 32:14.501
 ANY ADVANCEMENT IN SCIENCE
 HAS ITS CASUALTIES.

32:14.601 --> 32:16.667
 ISN'T IT BETTER A FEW
 MEN HAVE TO DIE

32:16.767 --> 32:20.067
 TO KEEP THE EINSTEINS
 OF THE WORLD ALIVE?

32:22.067 --> 32:24.501
RESULTS OF HIS
BLOOD WORK.

32:24.601 --> 32:27.901
 I'VE DISCOVERED THE KEY TO
 PREVENTING CELLULAR REGRESSION.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.734
 SIRTUIN LEVELS MUST BE
 CONSISTENTLY REGULATED.

32:30.834 --> 32:33.367
  IN OTHER WORDS, BOOSTER SHOTS
  MUST BE ADMINISTERED

32:33.467 --> 32:34.901
 ON A REGULAR BASIS.

32:35.000 --> 32:36.100
EXACTLY.

32:36.200 --> 32:39.033
SAME WAY A DIABETIC
USES INSULIN.

32:41.100 --> 32:45.868
 I'VE BEEN WAITING SIXTY
 YEARS TO SAY THIS:

32:45.968 --> 32:49.534
 LET'S PROCEED.

32:52.133 --> 32:53.400
  GUYS, WE'RE
  WASTING TIME HERE.

32:53.501 --> 32:55.400
 WE'RE NO CLOSER TO
 FINDING MY GRANDDAD.

32:55.501 --> 32:57.234
 LOOK, THE SECURITY FOOTAGE
 JUST GAVE US A CLEAR IMAGE

32:57.334 --> 32:59.334
 OF THE LICENCE PLATE OF THE
 AMBULANCE THAT BURNS' MEN

32:59.434 --> 33:00.834
 JUST DROVE
 HIM OFF IN.

33:00.934 --> 33:02.701
YEAH, AND BY TAPPING INTO THE
DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION,

33:02.801 --> 33:06.133
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO MONITOR
THEM THROUGH THE TRAFFIC CAMS.

33:06.234 --> 33:07.267
 I CAN'T WAIT AROUND FOR THIS.

33:07.367 --> 33:08.567
WE'RE GRASPING AT STRAWS.

33:08.667 --> 33:11.133
 NO, REALLY -- YOU MIGHT
 WANT TO CHECK THIS OUT.

33:11.234 --> 33:12.234
 I THINK I FOUND HIM.

33:12.334 --> 33:13.667
 HEADING WEST ON
 GARNET AVENUE.

33:13.767 --> 33:15.000
 NOW, AS LONG AS THEY
 STAY OFF THE INTERSTATE

33:15.100 --> 33:16.868
I THINK WE'LL BE
ABLE TO TRACK HIM.

33:16.968 --> 33:18.534
THIS IS HOPELESS.

33:18.634 --> 33:20.467
JESS.

33:20.567 --> 33:22.067
LOOK, WE'RE GOING TO FIND
YOUR GRANDFATHER, OKAY?

33:22.167 --> 33:23.667
JUST DON'T LOSE FAITH.

33:23.767 --> 33:25.000
  DON'T LOSE FAITH?

33:25.100 --> 33:26.267
 SHALIMAR, I DON'T
 THINK YOU UNDERSTAND.

33:26.367 --> 33:27.734
 IF BURNS FINDS MY GRANDDAD,

33:27.834 --> 33:30.133
HE'S GOING TO SLICE HIM AND DICE
HIM UNTIL HE GETS WHAT HE WANTS.

33:30.234 --> 33:32.334
OKAY, GOOD NEWS, PEOPLE.

33:32.434 --> 33:37.334
 LAST PICTURE WAS TAKEN OF THE
 AMBULANCE ON MISSION BAY DRIVE.

33:37.434 --> 33:38.834
SO WHAT'S THE BAD NEWS?

33:38.934 --> 33:40.901
  THERE IS NO BAD NEWS.

33:41.000 --> 33:42.267
THAT STREET ENDS
IN A DEAD END.

33:42.367 --> 33:43.834
  AND AT THE END OF
  THAT DEAD END...

33:43.934 --> 33:45.234
IS AN OLD
PHARMACEUTICAL LAB.

33:45.334 --> 33:46.200
  THAT'S GREAT.

33:46.300 --> 33:48.434
YOU HEAR THAT, JESS?

33:48.534 --> 33:50.100
 <i>JESSE?</i>

33:54.200 --> 33:56.934
HOW CAN YOU PEOPLE STAND
BACK AND LET THIS HAPPEN?

33:57.033 --> 33:58.868
SAVE YOUR BREATH, MAJOR.

33:58.968 --> 34:01.100
 YOU SHOULD BE
 MORE APPRECIATIVE.

34:01.200 --> 34:04.434
 YOU'RE ABOUT TO WITNESS
 HISTORY IN THE MAKING.

34:04.534 --> 34:05.701
GO TO HELL!

34:05.801 --> 34:07.601
SAY, THERE LIES THE RUB.

34:07.701 --> 34:15.601
 BY UNLOCKING THE KEY TO ETERNAL
 YOUTH I NEVER HAVE TO GO THERE.

34:44.333 --> 34:45.367
 LAB'S UP AHEAD.

34:45.467 --> 34:47.199
 I'M GOING TO TAKE
 HER DOWN ON THE ROOF.

34:47.300 --> 34:48.967
 JESSE'S NOT RESPONDING
 TO HIS COMLINK.

34:49.067 --> 34:50.701
 WHY WOULD HE TAKE
 OFF WITHOUT US?

34:50.801 --> 34:53.701
WELL, I'M SURE HE FEELS
LIKE THIS IS HIS BATTLE.

34:53.801 --> 34:56.300
PART OF ME
CAN'T BLAME HIM.

34:56.400 --> 34:57.467
 MAYBE.

34:57.567 --> 34:59.400
HE HAS NO IDEA WHAT HE'S
GETTING HIMSELF INTO.

34:59.501 --> 35:01.634
 HE'S GOING TO NEED ALL
 THE HELP HE CAN GET.

35:01.734 --> 35:03.901
WELL, MAYBE WE SHOULD
GIVE IT TO HIM.

35:17.434 --> 35:18.601
HOW'S THAT?

35:18.701 --> 35:21.567
 I FEEL LIKE A NEW MAN.

35:21.667 --> 35:26.434
 WELL, ALL YOU DID WAS WRAP THAT
 ROTTING SOUL IN A NEW PACKAGE.

35:26.534 --> 35:28.934
WELL, I GUESS IT'S TRUE WHAT
THEY SAY, THEN, ISN'T IT?

35:29.033 --> 35:30.901
WHAT'S THAT?

35:31.000 --> 35:34.400
YOUTH...

35:34.501 --> 35:37.467
HOW IT'S WASTED
ON THE YOUNG.

35:45.167 --> 35:48.567
  NOW, DESPITE WHAT
  YOU MIGHT THINK...

35:48.667 --> 35:52.067
LIFE IS SOMETHING THAT I
REALLY DO HOLD QUITE DEAR...

35:52.167 --> 35:54.767
 LONG AS IT'S MINE.

35:56.534 --> 35:57.934
 AGH!

35:59.667 --> 36:00.901
TAKE HIM OUT.

36:02.467 --> 36:04.033
 AGH!

36:08.801 --> 36:10.400
ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S IT, SONNY-BOY.

36:10.501 --> 36:14.901
IT ENDS HERE, OR YOU'LL BURY
YOUR GRANDFATHER WITH A HOLE.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.200
I MEAN IT.

36:17.300 --> 36:20.133
 ALL RIGHT,
 WHAT DO YOU WANT?

36:20.234 --> 36:21.634
YOU TURN AROUND.

36:21.734 --> 36:23.834
AND I PROMISE
I WON'T HURT HIM.

36:25.267 --> 36:27.734
THE SIRTUIN IS
HERE ON THE TABLE.

36:27.834 --> 36:30.934
IF YOU LEAVE NOW,
IT'S ALL YOURS.

36:31.033 --> 36:35.200
OTHERWISE,
I KILL HIM.

36:35.300 --> 36:37.634
PICK YOUR POISON.

36:37.734 --> 36:39.901
DON'T DO IT,
JESSE.

36:42.734 --> 36:44.400
ALRIGHT.

36:59.367 --> 37:01.100
EXCELLENT.

37:03.667 --> 37:05.067
 UGH!

37:11.033 --> 37:12.434
 <shot fired>

37:12.534 --> 37:15.067
GRANDPA?

37:25.968 --> 37:29.300
 WELL, I GUESS YOU'RE
 RIGHT, BURNSIE.

37:29.400 --> 37:32.634
 YOUTH REALLY IS
 WASTED ON THE YOUNG.

37:37.501 --> 37:39.234
 OH...

37:43.067 --> 37:44.267
 OH...

37:48.701 --> 37:51.067
 NO, THAT'S OKAY, KIDDO.

37:52.968 --> 37:56.234
GRANDPA,
YOU GOTTA TAKE IT.

37:56.334 --> 37:59.734
YOU KNOW WHAT'LL
HAPPEN IF YOU DON'T.

37:59.834 --> 38:01.634
NO, SON.

38:01.734 --> 38:03.667
  THIS HAS TO END HERE.

38:03.767 --> 38:05.667
 I'VE ALREADY LIVED MY LIFE.

38:05.767 --> 38:08.534
YEAH, WELL, MAYBE I'M
JUST NOT QUITE READY TO...

38:08.634 --> 38:11.367
LET YOU GO, YET.

38:11.467 --> 38:14.901
 I DON'T THINK THAT'S YOUR
 DECISION TO MAKE, JESS.

38:29.734 --> 38:31.868
 DESTROY IT ALL.

38:34.934 --> 38:37.234
 YOU HEARD HIM.

38:37.334 --> 38:39.334
WHAT ARE YOU GOING
TO TELL THE DOMINION?

38:39.434 --> 38:41.667
  SOMETHING SHORT AND PITHY.

38:41.767 --> 38:44.300
 I'LL BE DAMNED IF
 ANYONE DOES THIS AGAIN.

38:54.834 --> 38:58.133
  TAKE CARE OF ONE LAST
  WISH FOR AN OLD MAN?

38:58.234 --> 39:00.300
ANYTHING YOU WANT.

39:00.400 --> 39:04.300
 LET'S GO HOME.

39:16.367 --> 39:17.901
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

39:18.000 --> 39:19.767
WORDS ARE OVERRATED.

39:19.868 --> 39:21.934
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.

39:24.534 --> 39:27.567
LISTEN, JESSE, YOU
GOTTA DO ME A FAVOUR

39:27.667 --> 39:32.434
AND PROMISE ME YOU'LL STOP
BEING ANGRY WITH YOUR OLD MAN.

39:32.534 --> 39:34.467
 GRANDPA, HE WAS A POOR
 EXCUSE FOR A FATHER.

39:34.567 --> 39:35.934
NO, JESSE.

39:36.033 --> 39:38.534
HE DID THE BEST HE COULD.

39:38.634 --> 39:40.267
HE WAS RIGHT TO KEEP
YOU AWAY FROM ME.

39:40.367 --> 39:41.667
  HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?

39:41.767 --> 39:42.934
I MEAN,
YOU WERE A HERO.

39:43.033 --> 39:44.267
OH...

39:44.367 --> 39:46.367
THE THING ABOUT HEROES
IS THAT IN REAL LIFE

39:46.467 --> 39:49.467
THEY'RE FULL OF
NOTHING BUT FLAWS.

39:49.567 --> 39:51.701
WHEN I GOT OUT
OF THE SERVICE,

39:51.801 --> 39:55.901
I DIDN'T ADJUST REAL
WELL TO CIVILIAN LIFE.

39:56.000 --> 40:00.667
TURNED OUT TO BE NOTHING MORE
THAN A SELFISH HUSBAND,

40:00.767 --> 40:03.400
AND A LOUSY FATHER.

40:03.501 --> 40:05.300
  I DON'T BELIEVE THAT.

40:05.400 --> 40:08.501
LISTEN TO ME -- YOUR DAD WAS
ONLY TRYING TO PROTECT YOU.

40:08.601 --> 40:11.767
HE WANTED TO MAKE SURE
I DIDN'T LET YOU DOWN...

40:11.868 --> 40:14.801
THE WAY I DID WHEN
HE WAS GROWING UP.

40:14.901 --> 40:16.534
  I UNDERSTAND.

40:16.634 --> 40:19.667
THERE'S SOMETHING
I WANT YOU TO HAVE.

40:19.767 --> 40:21.067
 GRANDPA, NO,
 I CAN'T TAKE THAT.

40:21.167 --> 40:23.467
  IT'S YOUR MEDAL OF HONOR.

40:23.567 --> 40:24.834
YOU EARNED THAT.

40:24.934 --> 40:27.067
SO DID YOU.

40:32.133 --> 40:35.467
  BETTER NOT KEEP
  THE LADY WAITING.

40:40.133 --> 40:42.968
 SEE YA SOON,
 KIDDO.

40:43.067 --> 40:46.467
 YEAH.

41:02.834 --> 41:06.968
YOU DID THE
RIGHT THING, JESSE.

41:07.067 --> 41:08.334
 IS THAT WHAT THIS
 WAS ALL ABOUT?

41:08.434 --> 41:09.834
  SOME KIND OF A...

41:09.934 --> 41:12.367
 TEST OF TRUST?

41:12.467 --> 41:15.467
MAYBE.

41:15.567 --> 41:18.033
SO HOW DID I DO?

41:18.133 --> 41:20.300
I THINK YOU
ALREADY KNOW.

41:26.567 --> 41:29.901
  AM I EVER GOING
  TO SEE YOU AGAIN?

41:30.000 --> 41:33.334
IF THE TIME IS RIGHT.

41:33.434 --> 41:36.434
 TYPICAL EVASIVE ANSWER.

41:36.534 --> 41:40.667
GUESS I COULDN'T HAVE
EXPECTED ANYTHING ELSE, HUH?

41:40.767 --> 41:43.434
YOU TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.

41:43.534 --> 41:45.667
YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

41:48.167 --> 41:50.267
YOU, TOO.
