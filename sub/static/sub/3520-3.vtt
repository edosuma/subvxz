WEBVTT

00:16.893 --> 00:19.771
Aw! Fudgie the Whale?
Really?

00:19.938 --> 00:23.650
You guys got a Fudgie!
I love Fudgie.

00:23.817 --> 00:28.113
What, did you guys ship this from
Long Island? You guys, ridiculous!

00:28.279 --> 00:30.031
Remind me, though, I do have
to save a piece for my husband.

00:30.156 --> 00:32.283
He loves Fudgie.

00:35.120 --> 00:38.206
Yeah, guys!

00:38.373 --> 00:42.752
She-- She seriously wasn't joking!

00:42.919 --> 00:44.963
I can't believe you didn't know
she had a husband.

00:45.130 --> 00:46.506
She talks about him
all the time.

00:46.673 --> 00:49.759
Meredith is more of a man
than you and I combined, Patrick.

00:49.884 --> 00:51.886
Her wallet has a chain on it.

00:52.053 --> 00:54.806
It's hard for me to
take you seriously in that sweater.

00:55.014 --> 00:56.182
People are going crazy
for this sweater.

00:56.307 --> 00:57.475
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

00:57.684 --> 00:58.852
Anyway, on to the real news.

00:59.018 --> 01:00.812
After all the back and forth,

01:00.979 --> 01:02.897
me and you are back on
for this weekend.

01:03.064 --> 01:04.899
- Oh, my God!
- Starting tomorrow,

01:05.066 --> 01:06.776
we have 28 solid hours.

01:06.943 --> 01:09.195
No, no, no, you can't do that.
I've already made plans.

01:09.362 --> 01:11.322
Oh, come on.

01:11.489 --> 01:13.116
- Patrick, cancel them.
- No.

01:13.283 --> 01:15.618
I can't just drop everything
whenever you're free.

01:15.785 --> 01:18.496
- It's Dom's first gay rugby game.
- Patrick.

01:18.663 --> 01:20.165
What if you change your plans
at the last minute?

01:20.331 --> 01:23.126
Like when I was sitting in the Castro
watching <i>The Exorcist</i> all by myself?

01:23.293 --> 01:24.419
I'm definitely all yours.

01:24.586 --> 01:26.087
And you know how much
I hate the devil children.

01:26.254 --> 01:27.839
Fine, then don't
cancel your plans,

01:28.006 --> 01:30.383
- but take me with you.
- Right.

01:33.178 --> 01:35.513
- Wait, really?
- Yeah.

01:43.146 --> 01:44.689
Hey. Uh...

01:44.856 --> 01:46.941
I come in peace...

01:47.108 --> 01:48.985
and sober...

01:49.152 --> 01:51.404
with Roosevelt's tamales

01:51.571 --> 01:56.034
and a little Juicy Fruit
from the dispensary.

01:56.201 --> 01:58.077
No <i>pupusas</i>?

01:59.496 --> 02:02.540
You were passed out by
a <i>pupusa</i> cart last time I saw you.

02:02.707 --> 02:04.542
Mm.

02:04.709 --> 02:06.753
Yeah, that's one of the reasons
why I'm here.

02:06.920 --> 02:10.465
Uh, is this an okay time?

02:12.383 --> 02:13.968
Flip the sign for me.

02:18.640 --> 02:21.392
So the other night, um...

02:22.560 --> 02:24.187
I'm pretty sure I didn't
deserve anything from you

02:24.354 --> 02:27.357
but just walkin' on by.

02:27.524 --> 02:29.150
And you didn't.

02:31.069 --> 02:33.279
I'm... grateful, man.

02:35.740 --> 02:36.783
What's the other reason?

02:38.034 --> 02:41.079
Dude, when you
and Paddy were together,

02:41.246 --> 02:42.497
the shit that I pulled--

02:42.622 --> 02:45.750
We're going back there, huh?

02:45.917 --> 02:47.418
Look, I was going through
my own shit at the time,

02:47.585 --> 02:50.588
and I let it infect the good thing
happening between the two of you.

02:51.089 --> 02:54.759
You don't know how close I was
to punching your ass out that day.

02:56.719 --> 02:59.430
Is it because you're in love with him
or what? What is it?

03:00.598 --> 03:02.100
Who? Patrick?

03:02.267 --> 03:05.562
No, man.
Ugh, gross. No offense.

03:05.728 --> 03:07.981
So you were just being
an asshole for no reason.

03:08.147 --> 03:10.859
Awesome. That's great.

03:14.279 --> 03:15.947
Patrick send you down here?

03:16.114 --> 03:18.825
No. No, it was my idea.

03:18.992 --> 03:20.660
My brilliant idea.

03:20.827 --> 03:23.079
Uh, I'm just gonna go.

03:23.246 --> 03:26.124
Know what? Why don't
you grab a seat?

03:27.375 --> 03:28.710
We're closed, but that, uh,

03:28.877 --> 03:31.754
bush on your face...
Seriously?

03:38.803 --> 03:40.972
- Hey.
- Hey. We need to be cleaner.

03:41.139 --> 03:42.599
There are disgusting things
in corners

03:42.765 --> 03:44.475
and on edges
all over this place.

03:44.642 --> 03:46.311
Okay. Why are we being--

03:46.477 --> 03:50.732
- Kevin's staying over tomorrow.
- Oh. Oh! Are he and Jon not--

03:50.940 --> 03:53.985
No, no, Jon's just
out of town for the night.

03:54.152 --> 03:56.613
Oh. All right.
I guess I'll just

03:56.738 --> 03:58.448
- stay somewhere else.
- Yeah.

03:58.615 --> 04:00.658
- Let you two go crazy.
- Oh, God. Right.

04:00.825 --> 04:02.785
It is crazy, isn't it?
I don't know. Is it crazy?

04:02.911 --> 04:04.704
I don't know if I'm gonna
be able to have sex with him

04:04.871 --> 04:07.165
on a bed without bed bugs
and cum stains.

04:07.332 --> 04:09.751
- Why are there no cum stains?
- What are we gonna do?

04:09.918 --> 04:12.003
Are we gonna fuck?
Are we gonna cuddle, watch TV?

04:12.170 --> 04:14.505
- Do you think we should order in?
- Okay, okay, hey, hey.

04:14.631 --> 04:16.674
You two can do
whatever you want, right?

04:16.841 --> 04:19.302
Think of it like a test drive
for the two of you.

04:19.469 --> 04:22.013
Right.

04:22.180 --> 04:24.849
Hey, um, what are
you doing right now?

04:25.016 --> 04:28.019
This is the most
annoying part about being gay.

04:28.186 --> 04:29.354
Straight people
never have to think

04:29.479 --> 04:30.855
about shooting water
up their asses before sex.

04:31.397 --> 04:33.900
Straight people are having
buttloads of butt sex, trust me.

04:34.067 --> 04:35.985
Okay, let's just make this
quick. What's the best one?

04:36.152 --> 04:38.321
Are you serious right now?

04:38.488 --> 04:40.448
I... haven't ever needed.

04:40.615 --> 04:42.450
I have more
of a "self-cleaning oven."

04:42.617 --> 04:45.495
That is the stupidest thing
I've ever heard you say.

04:45.662 --> 04:48.456
- Haven't you and Kevin--
- Yes, yes, yes, we've been, but

04:48.539 --> 04:51.626
it's been more spur of the moment,
never so, you know, premeditated.

04:51.793 --> 04:52.919
It's not murder, Patrick.

04:53.044 --> 04:54.963
Okay, I don't need one of your
sex-positive talks right now.

04:55.129 --> 04:56.923
Oh, put the douche down.
You're not gonna need that.

04:57.090 --> 04:58.716
Oh, come on,
don't I wanna feel...

04:58.883 --> 05:01.052
"As fresh as a
mountain stream after a rain"?

05:01.219 --> 05:03.096
Is that what's going on?

05:03.262 --> 05:05.932
You still think getting fucked makes
you the girl in the relationship?

05:06.099 --> 05:09.811
No, no. I am totally,
officially versatile and loving it.

05:09.978 --> 05:11.396
You kind of have to be
with this one.

05:13.231 --> 05:15.149
Two.

05:15.316 --> 05:18.403
And I am not having
a colonoscopy tomorrow.

05:18.569 --> 05:20.279
- See how sex-positive I can be?
- Mm-hmm.

05:20.446 --> 05:23.074
Oh, honey,
do you know where you live?

05:25.326 --> 05:26.703
Your beard is half-gone.

05:26.869 --> 05:29.789
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
It's the new me. Huh?

05:29.956 --> 05:32.750
I like it. Slowly returning
to the world of the living.

05:32.917 --> 05:34.919
Ever so slowly. Yeah.

05:35.086 --> 05:37.422
You know,
Richie did a good job.

05:38.673 --> 05:39.757
<i>I don't understand.</i>

05:39.924 --> 05:41.467
I'm trying
to be a better person.

05:41.634 --> 05:43.386
And he just accepted that
and trimmed your beard?

05:43.553 --> 05:45.930
Oh, hell no.
He let me have it first.

05:46.097 --> 05:47.974
But then, yeah.

05:48.141 --> 05:49.767
Because he's the better person
that you're trying to be.

05:49.934 --> 05:52.603
Maybe. You should
definitely call him, though, yeah?

05:52.729 --> 05:54.397
Did he say that,
that I should call?

05:54.564 --> 05:56.774
No, but I think you shouldn't
throw away that connection

05:56.899 --> 05:58.401
that you two have, right?

05:58.484 --> 06:01.362
I don't know. I don't think
Richie wants to be friends.

06:01.529 --> 06:04.198
Oh, Jesus, look where we are.
You're all buddies with Richie

06:04.365 --> 06:05.700
and I'm cleaning out my ass
for Kevin.

06:05.867 --> 06:07.702
Oh, we should take a picture.
For Dom, right?

06:07.869 --> 06:09.454
- Okay, with the enema?
- Yeah, with the enema.

06:09.620 --> 06:11.497
- Okay.
- Oh, and when you text him,

06:11.664 --> 06:14.500
tell him that I said I'm bringing
Kevin to his game tomorrow,

06:14.667 --> 06:16.794
- but just as a friend.
- What? Are you serious?

06:16.961 --> 06:19.047
Yes, I'm serious.
Take the picture.

06:23.176 --> 06:26.137
This shirt
is two sizes too small.

06:26.304 --> 06:27.555
Look.

06:29.640 --> 06:31.893
I can't foresee too many
complaints about that.

06:33.811 --> 06:36.064
Agustín is gonna make
some bitchy comment,

06:36.230 --> 06:39.275
and Patrick's
bringing Kevin as a friend.

06:39.442 --> 06:42.153
Why did I invite anyone to this?
I barely know how to play.

06:42.320 --> 06:44.489
Just...
Will you just calm down?

06:44.614 --> 06:46.199
- I'm serious!
- Calm down.

06:46.324 --> 06:49.118
- Oh, oh!
- Jesus! What the fuck?!

06:49.619 --> 06:52.997
Please tell me again why it was
so important that we stay here?

06:53.164 --> 06:54.749
Because we always
stay at your place.

06:54.916 --> 06:57.418
I know. Can't we just
agree that my house is nicer

06:57.543 --> 06:58.795
and never come back here?

06:58.961 --> 07:02.548
Oh, bitch.
Well, your mattress is way nicer.

07:02.715 --> 07:05.468
- Mm. Mmm.
- I'll give you that.

07:05.635 --> 07:09.180
No!

07:09.347 --> 07:11.766
No, I'm not a morning person!

07:11.933 --> 07:15.061
And it's not like college at all.

07:15.228 --> 07:18.231
Baby, look, we got the Saturday
morning special going right now.

07:18.397 --> 07:21.067
Oh, okay. This is
like the morning cartoons?

07:21.234 --> 07:22.360
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

07:22.527 --> 07:24.737
'Cause that's exactly
what you are giving me.

07:24.904 --> 07:26.155
- What does that mean?
- Scooby Doo.

07:26.322 --> 07:28.324
No, no, baby.
Scooby Dong.

07:28.491 --> 07:30.201
Scooby Dong. Look, look.

07:30.368 --> 07:32.745
- Ready for action.
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

07:32.912 --> 07:35.206
I've not seen that
in the daylight, man.

07:35.373 --> 07:36.707
- Did I do that?
- Yes.

07:36.874 --> 07:38.543
Oh, my God, I'm talented.

07:38.709 --> 07:40.294
I'm worth something.
We should probably be quiet.

07:40.461 --> 07:43.923
- I think Dom's on the phone.
- Okay, what's up with you two?

07:44.090 --> 07:45.341
What do you mean?

07:45.508 --> 07:46.717
I mean, I don't know.

07:46.884 --> 07:49.887
Two grown-ass 40-year-olds
still doing the roommate thing.

07:50.054 --> 07:51.889
All right,
first of all, ish. 40-ish.

07:52.014 --> 07:54.058
- Excuse me, two 40-ishes.
- If it freaks you out so much

07:54.225 --> 07:55.643
why don't you get your boss
to do something about

07:55.768 --> 07:57.186
the freaking rents in this town.

07:57.353 --> 07:58.563
Maybe I will.

07:58.729 --> 08:00.690
Maybe I'll do that one better
if you ask nicely.

08:00.857 --> 08:03.234
Um, feel free to do
what you need to do.

08:03.401 --> 08:05.778
Well, just come back quick,
please, 'cause I can't...

08:05.945 --> 08:08.865
I could rev it up, but I can't get it
started without you.

08:09.031 --> 08:11.075
Hey, I-- Oh, my God!

08:11.242 --> 08:13.953
Oh, shit!
Oh, fuck, I'm naked.

08:14.120 --> 08:16.247
Okay, whatever, Lynn.

08:16.414 --> 08:17.915
Scoot over.

08:18.082 --> 08:19.876
- I'm sorry.
- Malik is here.

08:20.042 --> 08:23.004
We heard. The third time?
Third time lucky?

08:23.171 --> 08:25.047
Yes, yes. Oh, my God.

08:25.214 --> 08:27.717
I don't want to oversell this guy,
okay, but he's everything.

08:27.884 --> 08:30.845
I feel like I'm-- I'm completely
turned inside out right now.

08:31.012 --> 08:33.556
Is the back of my head
caved in?

08:33.723 --> 08:35.850
Oh, and also,
by the way, it turns out

08:36.017 --> 08:39.020
rimming... not just
for the gays anymore.

08:39.187 --> 08:40.813
- What?
- Don't be jealous, Lynn.

08:40.980 --> 08:44.942
- You rimmed him?
- No! God, no! He rimmed me!

08:45.109 --> 08:46.402
I think he rimmed me.
Whatever!

08:46.569 --> 08:48.404
He was all up in there.
He's very assy.

08:48.571 --> 08:51.699
Let's discuss this
over breakfast.

08:51.866 --> 08:53.409
Oh...

08:53.576 --> 08:54.869
I worked with him
for three years,

08:55.036 --> 08:56.704
and then once he got
appointed mayor--

08:56.871 --> 08:58.831
You segued into
the administration.

08:58.956 --> 08:59.999
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

09:00.166 --> 09:01.375
Do you see why
this is never gonna work?

09:01.542 --> 09:04.045
It's all politics all the time
with this guy.

09:04.170 --> 09:05.796
It's like dating
Rachel Maddow.

09:05.963 --> 09:08.132
You know, honestly,
I get that a lot.

09:08.299 --> 09:10.760
People stop me
on the street, like,

09:10.927 --> 09:13.971
"Ain't you that tall, white lesbian
with the big glasses?"

09:14.138 --> 09:15.806
Oh, yeah, all the time.
All the time.

09:15.973 --> 09:17.808
- By the way, mostly black women.
- It's very weird.

09:17.975 --> 09:19.477
Yeah. I spent a lot of time
in the South.

09:19.644 --> 09:21.979
Lynn, are you gonna come
cheer on Dom today?

09:22.146 --> 09:24.440
I'm gonna try, we've got
two weddings today, so...

09:24.607 --> 09:26.150
I completely
didn't even ask you.

09:26.317 --> 09:28.152
You had your lunch yesterday
with the investor guy, right?

09:28.277 --> 09:29.570
Uh-huh.
- Okay, what happened?

09:29.737 --> 09:31.239
- Wait, with Jack?
- Yeah.

09:31.405 --> 09:32.490
You didn't tell me
that was yesterday.

09:32.657 --> 09:34.158
There's nothing to tell.
He didn't even bring up

09:34.325 --> 09:36.035
investing in my place.
Not once.

09:36.202 --> 09:38.996
He just kept talking about
me managing his new restaurant.

09:39.163 --> 09:40.665
- Managing?
- Yeah.

09:40.831 --> 09:42.500
All right, I hope you
told him to fuck off.

09:42.667 --> 09:44.835
Wait, the new restaurant
in SoMa?

09:44.919 --> 09:46.003
Mm.

09:46.128 --> 09:49.298
That's...
That's a success.

09:49.465 --> 09:51.175
He wants you to manage it?

09:51.342 --> 09:53.427
Lynn, I'm practically
a manager at Zuni.

09:53.594 --> 09:55.680
Yeah, but you're not.

09:55.846 --> 09:57.890
I mean, technically,
you're still waiting.

09:58.057 --> 09:59.850
And I know you want to just
jump right into your own thing,

10:00.017 --> 10:03.646
but maybe Jack's thinking that this
could be, like, a first step.

10:03.813 --> 10:05.898
And see how you do there,
then start talking to you

10:06.107 --> 10:09.026
about, you know, your own place.

10:13.197 --> 10:15.616
Or...

10:15.783 --> 10:18.244
Or this idea sucks.

10:18.411 --> 10:20.246
And, you know,

10:20.413 --> 10:24.083
do whatever you want,
whatever you think.

10:34.010 --> 10:36.721
So, so sexy.

10:39.515 --> 10:41.600
- You waited?
- Hm.

10:43.519 --> 10:46.147
- Hello.
- Hey.

10:46.314 --> 10:47.565
You all right?

10:47.732 --> 10:49.734
- Yeah.
- Good.

10:49.900 --> 10:51.110
You know, we, uh--

10:51.235 --> 10:53.070
we don't have to do this
if you don't want to.

10:53.237 --> 10:55.072
I mean, everybody's gonna be there.
We could just,

10:55.239 --> 10:57.408
you know, rent some bikes,
maybe grab some lunch in Sausalito.

10:57.575 --> 11:00.703
Okay. Uh... no.

11:00.870 --> 11:02.955
I say we just stick
to the plan.

11:03.164 --> 11:04.373
Okay.

11:04.498 --> 11:06.250
Is there a bar
around here somewhere?

11:06.417 --> 11:07.668
- Yeah. Just down there.
- Good, good.

11:07.835 --> 11:09.003
Because I think
we both could use

11:09.170 --> 11:11.255
- a little Dutch courage.
- Absolutely.

11:11.422 --> 11:14.091
And I don't even know what that is.

11:14.258 --> 11:18.137
So is this like a pub that you would
go to normally in England?

11:18.304 --> 11:21.766
Uh, no, it's not shitty enough
to be a Romford pub.

11:21.932 --> 11:23.601
Romford? Okay.

11:23.768 --> 11:26.729
I'm picturing, like,
rolling hills and tennis courts.

11:26.896 --> 11:29.565
- Is it like Wimbledon?
- Uh, no.

11:29.732 --> 11:33.652
It is not at all like Wimbledon.
It's much more hideous.

11:35.404 --> 11:38.115
So what would you--
What would you, like,

11:38.282 --> 11:40.826
do for fun in Romford?

11:40.993 --> 11:42.995
Mm... I don't know.

11:43.162 --> 11:45.122
Just do what most kids do.

11:45.289 --> 11:47.833
Actually,
my friend Toby and I,

11:48.000 --> 11:50.378
we'd just spend all our spare time
designing new board games.

11:50.544 --> 11:52.171
No way! Me, too!

11:52.338 --> 11:54.256
Well, not all my spare time,

11:54.423 --> 11:56.384
but I actually
made up this space game

11:56.550 --> 11:58.844
where you had
to mine for uranium.

11:59.011 --> 12:01.722
You would mine for uranium?

12:01.889 --> 12:03.849
Yeah, right?
Paging Dr. Freud.

12:04.308 --> 12:06.227
- One, two, three!
<i>- Roll, Fog, Roll!</i>

12:06.394 --> 12:08.938
Let's go! Let's go!

12:12.108 --> 12:14.485
Go, go, go!

12:22.701 --> 12:26.205
Dom, won't be too much longer.
Danny's already lookin' beat-up.

12:28.499 --> 12:30.543
Whoo! Go, Dom!

12:30.709 --> 12:32.169
- Dom's going in.
- Yes!

12:32.336 --> 12:33.504
What, is he going in?

12:33.629 --> 12:35.923
He's standing up.
Something's happening.

12:36.090 --> 12:37.716
Does anyone know what
they're actually doing,

12:37.883 --> 12:40.511
except for, like,
being all porny

12:40.678 --> 12:44.974
and I want a naked calendar
of them on my fridge right now?

12:45.141 --> 12:47.059
- What is your name again?
- Eddie.

12:47.226 --> 12:50.187
And Agustín promised me
a hot shower orgy after the game,

12:50.354 --> 12:51.981
so I better get one.

12:52.148 --> 12:53.274
- Really?
- Yeah, I was.

12:53.441 --> 12:55.401
I was a horrible, little bastard
of a teenager.

12:55.526 --> 12:56.610
Oh, well, I just--

12:56.777 --> 12:58.696
I simply don't believe it,
because you're so charming now.

12:58.863 --> 13:00.448
Thank you. I know
it's hard to believe,

13:00.614 --> 13:02.199
but I was very different back then,

13:02.366 --> 13:05.077
and suppose I was the cliché

13:05.244 --> 13:08.622
of the angry young man
whose mother had walked out.

13:08.789 --> 13:11.459
Really? Your mom left?

13:12.710 --> 13:14.128
What-- What did she leave for?

13:14.920 --> 13:16.964
To do her thing.

13:17.173 --> 13:18.424
I don't blame her.
You know?

13:18.591 --> 13:20.885
My dad was my dad,
and she'd met someone.

13:21.051 --> 13:24.638
I didn't talk to her
for... for ages,

13:24.805 --> 13:27.766
but, uh, it's cool,
because we talk now.

13:29.143 --> 13:30.769
That must have
been really tough.

13:32.354 --> 13:33.898
Mm.

13:34.064 --> 13:37.026
But it gave an excuse
to get in all sorts of trouble.

13:37.193 --> 13:39.904
I think in the end

13:40.070 --> 13:43.282
I just needed to get
the fuck out of Romford.

13:43.449 --> 13:46.494
And then you came to America like
all the brave Pilgrims before you.

13:46.660 --> 13:50.206
I did. I'm an alien
of extraordinary abilities,

13:50.372 --> 13:52.541
and they're all still stuck at home
playing my video games.

13:52.708 --> 13:54.752
Wait, you're an-- What is an alien--
An alien of what?

13:54.919 --> 13:57.505
Buh-buh-uh! It's, uh--

13:57.671 --> 13:59.882
- That's my visa.
- Oh, yes, right.

14:00.090 --> 14:01.717
Oh, the visa.
Of course. Right.

14:01.884 --> 14:05.012
Yep. I've only got
two more years left on it.

14:05.179 --> 14:08.349
So, uh, I'd better
get married, or else...

14:08.516 --> 14:10.100
back to Romford.

14:11.727 --> 14:13.521
Huh.

14:15.105 --> 14:16.690
Let's do it.

14:16.857 --> 14:18.817
- Do what?
- Go to the match.

14:18.984 --> 14:20.611
- Oh, yeah.
- My Dutch courage has kicked in.

14:20.778 --> 14:21.820
- Oh, good, me too.
- Drink up.

14:26.492 --> 14:28.702
You're up. Go!

14:29.703 --> 14:31.205
- Dom's in!
- Oh, shoot!

14:31.372 --> 14:32.623
- All right. Awesome.
- Hello.

14:32.790 --> 14:33.999
- Good timing.
- We're here.

14:34.166 --> 14:35.751
Eddie, you remember Patrick, right?

14:35.918 --> 14:38.420
And this is Kevin,
Patrick's boss, and bud.

14:38.587 --> 14:40.673
- Hey, man.
- How are you?

14:40.839 --> 14:43.217
- Hello.
- Hello.

14:43.384 --> 14:45.344
Oh, here we go.

14:45.511 --> 14:47.846
- Come on, Dom!
- Ball's out! Ball's out!

14:48.013 --> 14:49.348
What are they saying?

14:49.515 --> 14:51.809
Uh, they're shouting
"Ball's out."

14:51.976 --> 14:54.562
Oh. Ooh.

14:54.728 --> 14:56.814
Yeah, no, it's not some
kind of testicle mishap,

14:56.981 --> 15:00.067
it just means that the ball
is out of the scrum.

15:00.234 --> 15:02.444
You say words real pretty like.

15:02.611 --> 15:04.780
Did you grow up playing, Kevin?

15:04.947 --> 15:06.949
No, too common, thank you.

15:07.116 --> 15:09.577
I played footie...
Soccer to you guys.

15:09.743 --> 15:12.079
But I know rugby.
Uh, for instance,

15:12.246 --> 15:13.747
that, um, that otter

15:13.914 --> 15:15.749
is the flanker,

15:15.916 --> 15:18.836
those two bears there
are the props,

15:19.003 --> 15:21.005
and that little guy over there

15:21.171 --> 15:23.757
who you know gets fucked
by the entire scrum

15:23.924 --> 15:27.177
is the hooker.

15:27.344 --> 15:29.513
I think I just
jizzed my shorts.

15:29.680 --> 15:31.807
You know so much about this.

15:31.974 --> 15:34.351
So do you have
a boyfriend, sexy?

15:34.518 --> 15:37.771
Oh, uh, you know, let's get
more juice boxes. Yeah?

15:37.938 --> 15:39.857
- Oh my God, cock block.
- Actually, Eddie--

15:40.024 --> 15:41.692
Yes, Eddie,
I do have a boyfriend.

15:41.859 --> 15:43.652
Oh, and where is
this boyfriend today?

15:43.819 --> 15:46.780
Jon is in San Diego
for work.

15:46.947 --> 15:49.575
Pics, please.
Let's see this Jon.

15:49.700 --> 15:51.035
I thought you
had something going on

15:51.201 --> 15:52.578
with cutie Irish Spring
over here.

15:52.745 --> 15:55.456
Us? No, no, no,
we just game together.

15:55.623 --> 15:56.915
Oh, ball's out!
Ball's out! Balls out!

15:57.082 --> 15:59.752
All right!
Here we go, Dom!

16:03.047 --> 16:04.506
- Ooh!
- Shit!

16:04.590 --> 16:06.258
- Oh!
- Ooh, is he okay?

16:12.806 --> 16:13.974
Okay.

16:14.058 --> 16:16.060
Is he faking it
'cause he has to look macho?

16:21.815 --> 16:25.069
- Too late.
- Damn it.

16:25.235 --> 16:29.114
So, uh, turns out Patrick is having
a fuckfest with his boss,

16:29.281 --> 16:32.534
- that Brit, tonight.
- I knew it!

16:32.701 --> 16:34.578
I'm never wrong, you bastards.

16:34.745 --> 16:37.247
So I need
a place to stay the night.

16:37.414 --> 16:40.876
I was thinking... Hmm?

16:41.043 --> 16:43.295
Honey, I work at a shelter.
I don't run one.

16:43.462 --> 16:44.755
Come on, man. It'll be fun.

16:44.922 --> 16:47.257
We can torrent
<i>Romy and Michele.</i>

16:47.424 --> 16:50.260
We'll get some
mochi ice cream.

16:50.427 --> 16:53.055
Only if it's chocolate.

16:58.936 --> 17:00.521
Guys, you wanna hear
some football chants?

17:00.688 --> 17:03.273
- Yeah.
- Uh, Dom!

17:03.440 --> 17:04.942
<i>Give us a wave.
I said, Dom, Dom!</i>

17:05.109 --> 17:06.944
<i>Give us a wave.
I said, Dom!</i>

17:07.111 --> 17:08.779
<i>Give us a wave!
I say Dom, Dom!</i>

17:08.946 --> 17:10.364
<i>Give us a wave!
I say Dom!</i>

17:10.531 --> 17:12.324
<i>Give us a wave!
I say Dom, Dom!</i>

17:12.491 --> 17:14.451
<i>Give us a wave!
I say Dom!</i>

17:14.618 --> 17:16.078
<i>Give us a wave!
I say Dom! Dom!</i>

17:16.245 --> 17:17.663
<i>Give us a wave!
I say Dom!</i>

17:17.830 --> 17:19.957
<i>Give us a wave!
I say Dom, Dom!</i>

17:20.124 --> 17:22.126
<i>Give us a wave!
I say Dom, Dom!</i>

17:22.292 --> 17:23.961
<i>Give us a wave!
I say Dom, Dom!</i>

17:24.128 --> 17:25.713
<i>Give us a wave!
I say Dom, Dom!</i>

17:25.879 --> 17:27.631
<i>Give us a wave!
I say Dom, Dom!</i>

17:30.801 --> 17:34.304
Everyone made out under the bleachers
on a Friday night except me.

17:34.471 --> 17:36.557
And now it's time
to correct that?

17:36.724 --> 17:41.186
Well, this isn't exactly
under, but... it'll do fine.

17:58.287 --> 18:00.539
- I think something just happened.
- Yeah, it certainly did,

18:00.706 --> 18:03.792
and we are getting
the fuck out of here.

18:13.802 --> 18:15.345
First-timer scores
the winning try.

18:15.512 --> 18:17.848
It's all downhill
from here, Dommy.

18:18.348 --> 18:20.100
He's probably
right about that.

18:20.267 --> 18:23.061
I don't know. Looks like
the mark of a champion to me.

18:24.730 --> 18:26.231
Oh. Don't feel a thing.

18:26.398 --> 18:28.275
Ah. Numb in the glow
of victory.

18:28.442 --> 18:31.361
Yeah, talk to me tomorrow.

18:33.197 --> 18:34.698
Hey, I don't think
I ever told you I, uh,

18:34.865 --> 18:36.116
I really liked your pop-up.

18:36.283 --> 18:38.577
- Excuse me?
- Restaurant.

18:38.744 --> 18:41.914
- Your pop-up restaurant.
- Thanks for clarifying.

18:42.080 --> 18:43.457
Yes, yes.

18:43.582 --> 18:45.667
No, I've been to, like, four
or five others since then,

18:45.834 --> 18:49.546
and they really made
yours stand out. Honestly.

18:49.713 --> 18:52.341
Thanks. I appreciate that.

18:54.468 --> 18:56.720
Lynn says he hooked you up to
manage Jack's new place in SoMa?

18:56.929 --> 18:58.847
I love that place.

18:59.014 --> 19:00.808
Sorry, Lynn... hooked me up?

19:00.974 --> 19:04.603
Yeah. Yeah, he said he told Jack
you'd be a great manager.

19:15.864 --> 19:19.785
I think I get it. Gay rugby is all
about the showers afterwards, right?

19:19.952 --> 19:22.079
That's right.

19:22.246 --> 19:24.039
Hey, how did he do?

19:24.206 --> 19:26.375
Oh, hey. Uh...

19:26.542 --> 19:29.503
Yeah, he, well, I'm sorry
to tell you, he won,

19:29.670 --> 19:31.088
so we're gonna
go meet the boys,

19:31.255 --> 19:33.048
but I think that means
that you're buying, right?

19:33.215 --> 19:35.592
- Well, okay.
- Hey!

19:35.759 --> 19:38.512
Hey!

19:38.679 --> 19:40.764
- Congrats.
- Can you give us a second?

19:40.931 --> 19:43.767
Yes.
She just-- You won the game?

19:43.934 --> 19:46.436
- Yeah.
- You won-- I'm sorry, I--

19:46.603 --> 19:49.189
- But apparently, I'm buying drinks--
- Did you know?

19:49.356 --> 19:51.900
That my meeting with Jack
was always

19:52.067 --> 19:54.194
just for a management job
and nothing else?

19:54.361 --> 19:55.654
I...

19:55.821 --> 19:57.531
I knew that he was
looking for someone,

19:57.698 --> 19:59.783
and I know that
he has a lot of money.

19:59.950 --> 20:01.410
You want to fumble
a little more?

20:03.996 --> 20:06.290
If I told you that, you wouldn't
have gone, would you?

20:06.456 --> 20:09.626
Stop telling people
that I'd take a manager job.

20:09.793 --> 20:14.298
That's not what I am.
That's not what I'm gonna be.

20:14.464 --> 20:17.134
Dom, your reaction, it's...

20:18.719 --> 20:21.305
- I'm just trying to help.
- I didn't ask for help.

20:23.974 --> 20:25.809
You were the one who said
you didn't want to get involved

20:25.934 --> 20:27.352
in any business dealing.

20:27.519 --> 20:29.897
Didn't you tell me that?

20:33.025 --> 20:36.069
- Yes.
- Then don't.

20:40.657 --> 20:42.367
Come on,
let's get a drink.

20:55.547 --> 20:58.675
<i>"Finding the Boyfriend Within"?</i>

20:58.842 --> 21:01.553
Uh, no,
back on the shelf, please.

21:03.013 --> 21:04.681
All you need to know
is that it takes a real man

21:04.848 --> 21:07.434
to admit that he reads
self-help books at times.

21:07.601 --> 21:10.395
I'm sorry, I can't rip
my eyes from these pages.

21:10.562 --> 21:15.400
This is suggesting that you--
You take yourself out on a date.

21:15.567 --> 21:17.110
Have you--
Have you done that?

21:17.277 --> 21:20.447
No, correction. You take
the boyfriend within out on a date.

21:20.614 --> 21:23.492
Which is you,
your inner boyfriend.

21:23.659 --> 21:25.535
Did you do that?

21:25.661 --> 21:28.163
Oh, please, please tell me.

21:28.246 --> 21:30.624
I promise I'll put it
back on the shelf.

21:30.791 --> 21:34.378
- I did.
- My God!

21:35.837 --> 21:38.548
- You know, I'm impressed.
- Thank you.

21:38.674 --> 21:40.759
How-- How did it go
for the two of you?

21:40.926 --> 21:42.094
It was good at first, actually.

21:42.302 --> 21:45.180
He was a little quiet,
a little internal.

21:45.347 --> 21:47.307
But then the real trouble
started when I realized

21:47.432 --> 21:49.226
that my boyfriend within
hates this fucking book.

21:51.478 --> 21:53.063
Oh, God.

21:53.230 --> 21:55.065
I did read that, though.

21:56.692 --> 21:57.901
Well...

21:58.902 --> 22:02.239
I think he sounds hot,

22:02.406 --> 22:05.075
this inner boyfriend.

22:13.083 --> 22:16.044
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
What, what, what, what, what?

22:16.211 --> 22:19.423
We actually get to take
our time tonight, right?

22:20.757 --> 22:24.594
So... why don't we?

22:26.430 --> 22:28.265
I like this Patrick.

22:28.432 --> 22:31.309
Master of his domain.

22:32.728 --> 22:36.023
What shall we do... Master?

22:40.110 --> 22:42.696
I love this.
This is such a good choice.

22:42.863 --> 22:44.781
Hey.

22:44.948 --> 22:47.784
- Oh. Sorry.
- You're buzzing. It's okay.

22:58.170 --> 23:00.213
I think I would
have sex with her, right?

23:00.380 --> 23:03.925
If I was gonna go
for a girl.

23:04.092 --> 23:07.637
Or maybe I'd do a three-way
with both of them.

23:07.804 --> 23:11.391
Would you do
a three-way with them?

23:11.558 --> 23:14.269
I'd do a three-way with you
and your inner boyfriend.

23:42.506 --> 23:44.216
Your turn.

23:47.344 --> 23:49.137
Really?

23:49.304 --> 23:51.181
Yup.

23:55.143 --> 23:57.854
But I'm fresh
as a mountain stream.

23:58.021 --> 24:00.357
What?

24:00.524 --> 24:02.359
Nothing.

24:03.360 --> 24:04.820
Let's do this.

24:16.289 --> 24:18.583
Oh, Jesus Christ.

24:19.918 --> 24:21.086
I'm gonna cum.

24:21.253 --> 24:23.338
- You're gonna cum?
- I'm gonna-- Yeah.

24:23.505 --> 24:26.216
Fuck, I'm gonna cum.
Oh, fuck! Oh!

24:27.759 --> 24:30.053
Oh, I'm gonna fucking--

24:31.805 --> 24:33.723
Oh, shit!

24:41.189 --> 24:44.067
Oh, my God.

24:45.402 --> 24:48.572
Oh, fuck. Oh, fucking...

24:50.448 --> 24:53.201
Oh, Jesus Christ.

24:53.368 --> 24:56.121
Oh, fuck!

25:26.318 --> 25:29.154
Hey, baby. Hey.

25:29.321 --> 25:32.991
Sorry. I must have took
an early dinner and crashed out.

25:33.158 --> 25:36.786
Yeah, no, I just saw you'd called
when I got up to take a piss.

25:36.953 --> 25:38.330
How was the game?
