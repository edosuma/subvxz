Previously on E.R.

00:05.571 --> 00:07.725
It's imposible for that woman
to be my mother.

00:07.726 --> 00:11.105
The information is there. I can get it.
You're not gonna quit, are you?

00:11.140 --> 00:12.059
You're fired.

00:12.060 --> 00:13.921
Have you talked to Weaver
about an Attending position?

00:14.022 --> 00:15.846
If she wanted me,
she would have asked me about it.

00:15.847 --> 00:17.826
I never got a chance
to thank you.

00:17.827 --> 00:19.624
I got my Chief Resident confirmation.

00:19.825 --> 00:21.437
- I won't let you down.
- I'm sure you won't.

00:21.438 --> 00:23.258
Don't talk to me about Luka.

00:23.259 --> 00:24.624
I don't want to wish bad things for you.

00:24.625 --> 00:27.723
And I don't want to sit on the sidelines
waiting for you two to break up.

00:30.704 --> 00:32.747
- Hey!
- Roger.

00:33.887 --> 00:35.843
You stay away from my wife.

One hundred and forty patients,
27 admissions, has to be a shift record.

00:45.077 --> 00:46.322
I got a record.

00:46.411 --> 00:49.912
There's a guy in Exam 4 that swallowed
50 hot dogs in 19 minutes.

00:50.083 --> 00:52.372
Shift record, as in "shift over."

00:52.461 --> 00:54.336
- Who has Pelar now?
- Which one's that?

00:54.422 --> 00:56.581
Kidney stone in 7, since this morning.

00:56.758 --> 00:58.134
I admitted him to Urology.

00:58.302 --> 01:00.591
- I just need a diet order.
- Two grams sodium.

01:00.763 --> 01:03.967
- Give me the beer.
- No. This is my personal property!

01:04.141 --> 01:06.301
- Give me the beer!
- Two grams sodium in 7.

01:06.478 --> 01:08.805
- I need help with a Foley.
- It's personal property!

01:08.982 --> 01:10.227
- What room?
- Right here!

01:10.400 --> 01:11.681
- No!
- What's the problem?

01:11.861 --> 01:14.815
He's drunk, combative, and he won't
give up his beer! Give me-

01:14.990 --> 01:17.029
- Is it open?
- Oh, Abby, I need help!

01:17.201 --> 01:18.576
I need to pee!

01:18.744 --> 01:21.366
- Sorry. I just punched out.
- That's gonna cost you.

01:21.622 --> 01:23.781
Where's Mark?
Mark Greene, your Attending.

01:23.958 --> 01:25.999
I think he quit.

01:26.712 --> 01:29.168
Silvadene and dress
the second-degree areas.

01:29.340 --> 01:30.799
Kerry, have you seen Mark?

01:30.967 --> 01:33.256
Elizabeth, I need you
to see a post-op seroma.

01:33.429 --> 01:35.221
Can I put my baby down?
Where's Mark?

01:35.389 --> 01:37.466
- T ry Curtain 3.
- No urine in the last hour.

01:37.642 --> 01:40.050
Bolus a liter of Ringer's.
Call for a renal consult.

01:40.230 --> 01:43.480
Dr. Weaver? X-ray's behind, and
my wrist fracture wants to leave AMA.

01:43.650 --> 01:47.731
Jing-Mei, you're Chief Resident.
Don't check with me on every patient.

01:47.906 --> 01:49.898
You have to learn
to keep things flowing.

01:50.074 --> 01:52.234
We don't have time for ones
we can move quickly.

01:52.412 --> 01:54.570
- Turf and admit, treat and street.
- Mark!

01:54.663 --> 01:56.657
Bag him.
Prep the neck, 1 percent with epi.

01:56.833 --> 01:58.992
- What do you think you're doing?
- We got jammed.

01:59.169 --> 02:00.831
You said to meet in the parking lot.

02:01.005 --> 02:03.960
Drunk, boating accident, busted his face.
We need to crike him.

02:04.134 --> 02:06.377
This is exactly why we need
a weekend nanny.

02:06.554 --> 02:09.455
- A weekday nanny's bad enough.
- It doesn't make us bad parents.

02:09.524 --> 02:11.133
I just want to raise our children.

02:11.202 --> 02:12.976
Then be home when you say
you'll be home.

02:13.063 --> 02:14.657
I'm an hour late for my shift.

02:14.748 --> 02:18.185
- Sats are down to 84.
- Introducer needle. Five more minutes.

02:19.279 --> 02:23.147
Finish the procedure, give it to
a Resident and meet me upstairs.

02:25.286 --> 02:27.492
You're in trouble, doc.

02:28.873 --> 02:30.285
- You're being stubborn.
- I'm not.

02:30.375 --> 02:33.746
You have 6 weeks on your Residency.
You don't have a job elsewhere.

02:33.838 --> 02:35.630
You know she's looking
for an Attending.

02:35.799 --> 02:37.922
- She should ask me.
- You're being stubborn.

02:38.093 --> 02:39.718
- I don't think I'm being-
- Abby!

02:39.888 --> 02:42.557
Hey, can you try for a line
on Barney before you go?

02:42.641 --> 02:44.800
- He's back with cellulitis.
- -I'm off.

02:44.894 --> 02:46.175
Conni said you found a vein last time.

02:46.270 --> 02:48.180
- But I'm off.
- He's asking for you.

02:48.273 --> 02:50.563
I'm off. I'm off. I'm gone.
I'm out of here.

02:50.985 --> 02:54.521
- Someplace important to be?
- Home. I have to be back here at 7.

02:54.656 --> 02:57.147
- Have a good night.
- See you tomorrow.

02:57.952 --> 02:59.327

- What?
- A bee flew in his Coke.

03:17.685 --> 03:18.966
Can I ask you a question?

03:19.145 --> 03:22.396
Airway's clear, no wheezing.
50 of Benadryl, p. o.

03:22.566 --> 03:24.689
Better get that new Attending
in here, huh?

03:24.860 --> 03:28.195
Hey, Haleh, I need a visual acuity
on the foreign body in 8.

03:28.282 --> 03:29.313
In a minute.

03:29.408 --> 03:31.084
- Are you actively recruiting?
- What?

03:31.177 --> 03:33.487
Is it word of mouth?
Are you headhunting?

03:33.580 --> 03:35.619
Running a classified in the annals.

03:36.208 --> 03:37.489
Unresponsive initially.

03:37.710 --> 03:40.628
- What's the half-life of glyburide?
- Ten hours. Overdose?

03:40.797 --> 03:42.422
- Sixty milligrams.
- Admit him.

03:42.507 --> 03:44.584
The hypoglycemia lasts for over a day.

03:44.760 --> 03:48.344
- Because I was thinking about applying.
- For Attending?

03:48.515 --> 03:51.517
- It is my next step.
- Oh, yeah. Right. Of course.

03:51.685 --> 03:53.014
You don't sound enthusiastic.

03:53.187 --> 03:56.272
We were hoping for someone
at least five years post-Residency.

03:56.442 --> 04:00.144
- But, yeah, certainly apply.
- Right.

04:00.990 --> 04:03.481
- In case you can't find anybody better.
- John!

04:03.659 --> 04:05.818
John! Can you clear a toe lac
in Curtain 2?

04:05.995 --> 04:07.906
- I'm off.
- He's been waiting five hours.

04:08.082 --> 04:11.581
- I can't get to it. We need the bed.
- I'm meeting my parents for dinner.

04:11.753 --> 04:15.253
- You can dispo him in 15 minutes.
- I've done my share of dispos today.

04:15.424 --> 04:17.666
- For me?
- Sorry. Give it to Malucci.

04:17.844 --> 04:22.137
Malucci's not here for another hour.
Cleo is stuck with pulmonary edema.

04:22.307 --> 04:25.429
I'm babysitting four ICU players.
We're down two nurses.

04:25.604 --> 04:30.018
And the rack is overflowing. Please?
If you could just take one easy patient.

04:30.193 --> 04:32.435
That's all I'm asking.

04:33.655 --> 04:37.986
- All right. One patient.
- Thank you.

04:39.538 --> 04:41.595
Wait. What room?

05:37.889 --> 05:39.466
We were unloading the volcano.

05:39.640 --> 05:42.556
I dropped the base on my foot
between the lift and the platform.

05:42.724 --> 05:44.301
- Volcano?
- The show ends...

05:44.475 --> 05:48.256
...with this big volcano explosion
with real live lava and steam and crap.

05:48.434 --> 05:52.181
- Not real lava.
- No, but it's real-looking lava, though.

05:53.478 --> 05:54.971
This is more than just a cut.

05:55.062 --> 05:57.267
The damn thing almost sliced my toe off.

05:57.438 --> 06:01.219
Yeah. It was just hanging there
like a big noodle or something.

06:01.397 --> 06:05.309
Have to do a digital block, have to wait
for X-ray, have to sew a two-layer repair.

06:05.482 --> 06:08.018
- You signed up for it.
- This'll take more than an hour.

06:08.191 --> 06:10.562
Hurry up. Maybe we can catch
the end of the show.

06:10.734 --> 06:12.690
- The guys are opening for Metallica.
- Guys?

06:12.860 --> 06:16.522
- We're roadies for Touching Wood.
- All right! What's the name of that song?

06:16.695 --> 06:18.401
- "Rapture Bitch. "
- I like that song.

06:18.570 --> 06:20.111
It's not even their best song.

06:20.279 --> 06:23.231
I'll numb the two nerves in your toe,
and then I'll wash it out.

06:23.405 --> 06:25.396
Then we'll take you for an x-ray.

06:26.281 --> 06:29.364
- You want to wait outside?
- No, I'm cool.

06:36.118 --> 06:37.777
That happens.

06:37.952 --> 06:41.782
Take his set of vitals.
Run in a liter of saline if he's postural.

06:43.620 --> 06:45.446
Carter, he's not breathing.

06:46.955 --> 06:48.234
What?

06:48.414 --> 06:50.654
The surgery caused the infection?

06:50.831 --> 06:54.909
It may have contributed, yes.
But because of his compromised state...

06:55.083 --> 06:58.745
...he wasn't able to fight off the infection
even with appropriate antibiotics.

06:58.917 --> 07:01.241
I told him not to drink so much.

07:01.418 --> 07:05.544
If you'd like to go in and see him,
I'll be in there in a minute.

07:05.711 --> 07:09.754
- Jacy, Jacy, could you take her?
- Oh, of course. This way.

07:10.796 --> 07:14.377
Sorry. He started seizing. I had to
give him Dilantin and get him to CT.

07:14.548 --> 07:16.455
- We are not doing this anymore!
- What?

07:16.632 --> 07:19.418
No more weekend shifts that
are even close to one another.

07:19.592 --> 07:21.879
We got jammed.
Four hours should've been enough.

07:22.051 --> 07:24.505
I'm not explaining to a woman
why her son died...

07:24.677 --> 07:26.882
...while my baby
is screaming in her face!

07:27.053 --> 07:28.214
- Okay.
- I'm not!

07:28.386 --> 07:29.927
I said, okay.

07:30.095 --> 07:31.802
She missed her nap.

07:31.971 --> 07:34.674
Get her home. Give her 4 more
ounces and put her down.

07:34.847 --> 07:36.505
- Is the milk defrosted?
- Yes.

07:36.681 --> 07:39.349
But you'll have to take another out
for tonight.

07:39.515 --> 07:42.087
Okay. I got it, I got it, I got it.

07:42.433 --> 07:44.259
Is that our homeless guy?

07:45.267 --> 07:48.429
Post-op bacteremia. He died of sepsis.

07:48.518 --> 07:50.132
He has a mother?

07:51.185 --> 07:54.055
Apparently, we all have a mother!

07:55.437 --> 07:59.812
Y es, yes. She's a little cranky.
That's all right. You'll be all right.

07:59.980 --> 08:02.648
- Give me some cricoid pressure.
- Sats are down to 90.

08:02.815 --> 08:05.564
All right, I'm in. Bag him.
What did you take?

08:05.732 --> 08:07.142
I didn't take anything.

08:07.316 --> 08:09.888
- Him. What did he take? Drugs? Alcohol?
- I don't know.

08:10.067 --> 08:12.106
Some beer, some pot,
some Georgia Homeboy.

08:12.277 --> 08:13.556
- That liquid G?
- Yeah.

08:13.735 --> 08:15.892
Call for a vent, B.A.L.
and tox screen. Cleo!

08:16.069 --> 08:18.772
Take this guy. Respiratory arrest
from a GHB overdose.

08:18.945 --> 08:20.190
- I can't.
- I'm off duty.

08:20.362 --> 08:22.567
- I have the stampede.
- What stampede?

08:22.738 --> 08:24.979
Guitar player collapsed at a rock concert.

08:25.073 --> 08:26.614
The crowd just mobbed the stage.

08:26.782 --> 08:28.440
- Where?
- At the United Center.

08:28.615 --> 08:31.187
No way. Metallica or us?

08:32.450 --> 08:34.856
- Any head injury?
- Just slumped to the floor.

08:35.034 --> 08:37.109
- History of seizures?
- Girlfriend might know.

08:37.284 --> 08:40.366
- Okay, ask her.
- Have an intubation from the concert?

08:40.535 --> 08:43.321
Apneic on scene.
Pupils are equal and reactive.

08:43.495 --> 08:46.447
Carter took his friend.
He thinks they mixed alcohol with GHB.

08:47.289 --> 08:50.869
- BP's 122/78.
- Doctor, three crush injuries rolling in.

08:51.039 --> 08:53.873
I'll be right there.
Blood gas, B.A.L. and tox screen.

08:54.041 --> 08:56.328
And have Carter
follow their labs together.

08:56.501 --> 08:58.621
There's a guy in a ponytail,
says he knows you.

08:58.792 --> 09:01.792
- Take a name. Make him wait.
- BP, 100/60. Pulse, 110.

09:01.961 --> 09:04.035
Complains of abdominal pains, no LOC.

09:04.128 --> 09:05.918
Contusions to the trunk and extremities.

09:06.086 --> 09:09.584
- His family coming in with him?
- No, he was by himself, but it was crazy.

09:09.755 --> 09:11.960
Who brings a 7-year-old
to a heavy-metal concert?

09:12.131 --> 09:13.410
One, two, three.

09:13.631 --> 09:17.673
All right, portable C-spine, chest
and pelvis. Trauma panel, dip a urine.

09:17.841 --> 09:19.548
What's his name? Kevin, I'm Dr. Finch.

09:19.633 --> 09:21.043
Do you know your phone number?

09:21.217 --> 09:23.788
- I can't breathe.
- We'll help you.

09:24.010 --> 09:25.800
- They were pushing.
- Good breath sounds.

09:25.968 --> 09:27.675
I know, but you're safe now.

09:27.844 --> 09:30.132
Epigastric tenderness.
No rebound or guarding.

09:30.303 --> 09:31.584
Sinus tach at 112.

09:31.763 --> 09:33.386
- Is there a Dr. Benton here?
- Me.

09:33.554 --> 09:35.214
A unit called in from St. Rafe's.

09:35.305 --> 09:37.462
An ER doc thinks he's got
your kid over there.

09:37.639 --> 09:38.670
What?

09:39.307 --> 09:41.843
Deaf, 3 or 4, Reece Benton
written inside his jacket.

09:42.016 --> 09:44.340
- He okay?
- They're looking for a parent.

09:44.517 --> 09:46.307
- Where's Carla?
- Who's Carla?

09:46.476 --> 09:47.969
- His mother.
- I don't know.

09:48.143 --> 09:50.134
Dispatch asked me to see
if I could find you.

09:50.310 --> 09:53.144
Lily, get another surgeon. Peter, go.

09:59.397 --> 10:02.764
- What sort of look you going for here?
- Hey.

10:05.357 --> 10:07.396
- Bought a TV?
- Yep.

10:07.567 --> 10:09.274
Anything else?

10:10.317 --> 10:12.558
Sony PlayStation.

10:13.443 --> 10:18.316
I was thinking more along the lines
of furniture. You know, table, chairs...

10:18.487 --> 10:21.236
- ... bed.
- I got an aquarium.

10:21.447 --> 10:23.568
Yes, I see.

10:28.323 --> 10:32.485
- Couldn't get a bigger one, huh?
- The next size up was pretty expensive.

10:35.493 --> 10:39.535
- I thought we were gonna go out to eat.
- I'm still hungry. Want to play?

10:39.703 --> 10:43.069
- I don't think so.
- We can hunt zombies together.

10:44.121 --> 10:46.575
Couldn't we just reason with them?

10:49.206 --> 10:51.612
- I think I'm just gonna go home.
- No, no. Stay.

10:51.791 --> 10:55.867
No, no. Zombies and a pizza
isn't really my thing.

11:01.168 --> 11:03.740
You're right. Let's go.

11:03.920 --> 11:06.456
I agreed to suture a toe lac,
now I got three patients.

11:06.629 --> 11:09.119
Those two are the same guy.
Order the same stuff.

11:09.297 --> 11:10.837
- Get Chen.
- She has a head trauma.

11:11.005 --> 11:13.245
I don't care. Get her.
I'm handing this off.

11:13.422 --> 11:16.505
He might be famous one day.
You can say you helped save his life.

11:16.674 --> 11:19.543
We're in the Emergency department.
Ask for Dr. Finch.

11:19.717 --> 11:21.874
It's extension 7614.

11:22.051 --> 11:23.877
- I'm trying to be gentle.
- But it hurts.

11:24.052 --> 11:26.089
- What happened to Peter?
- Personal emergency.

11:26.260 --> 11:29.876
This is Kevin, crushed against
the stage at a Metallica concert.

11:30.054 --> 11:32.508
Hello, Kevin. Aren't you a little young
for Metallica?

11:32.679 --> 11:35.548
They didn't start yet.
It was the warm-up group.

11:36.139 --> 11:37.798
We're trying to track down his parents.

11:37.889 --> 11:39.348
Got the answering machine.

11:39.515 --> 11:40.842
Any evidence of bleeding?

11:41.015 --> 11:44.679
No. Liver and spleen are intact, but
there's moderate epigastric tenderness.

11:44.850 --> 11:46.130
Could be an abdominal-wall injury,

11:46.225 --> 11:48.513
small-bowel perf, a bruised pancreas.

11:48.685 --> 11:50.759
- Want to get a CT?
- And serial exams.

11:50.935 --> 11:53.804
- We'll see if anything declares itself.
- Kevin? Oh, my God!

11:53.979 --> 11:56.100
Kevin, I'm so sorry.

11:56.605 --> 11:59.853
- You let go of my hand.
- I tried to hold on. I'm sorry.

12:00.814 --> 12:02.889
- Is he okay?
- Who are you?

12:03.273 --> 12:05.099
Marla. I'm his babysitter.

12:05.274 --> 12:07.479
His parents let you take him
to rock concerts?

12:07.650 --> 12:09.221
My boyfriend came over with tickets.

12:09.256 --> 12:11.604
We were gonna leave early.
He was gonna be in bed by 11.

12:11.777 --> 12:13.518
Do you have a number for them?

12:13.693 --> 12:15.981
- Did you call it?
- I wanted to find Kevin first.

12:16.695 --> 12:17.939
You found him.

12:19.654 --> 12:21.693
Draw up etomidate, sux
and grab Surgery.

12:21.864 --> 12:24.613
- That our last crush victim?
- I don't know, I just got here.

12:24.781 --> 12:26.689
Multiple rib fractures,
needs chest tubes.

12:26.865 --> 12:28.655
Curtain 3.
Get out of those gym clothes.

12:28.824 --> 12:32.273
- Chief, I just got here.
- Come to work dressed properly.

12:33.700 --> 12:35.573
Dr. Weaver?

12:39.203 --> 12:43.150
Yosh, I need 100 of mannitol
in Exam 4 right away.

12:43.329 --> 12:44.704
- Do you have a minute?
- No.

12:44.871 --> 12:47.242
You're not thrilled to see me.
I screwed up last-

12:47.414 --> 12:49.903
I'm not interested
in a private investigator.

12:50.081 --> 12:51.990
Frank, still waiting on that head CT.

12:52.082 --> 12:53.539
- Just went down.
- How long?

12:53.624 --> 12:56.328
- Who knows?
- Well, get Radiology on the phone.

12:56.417 --> 12:57.579
I found her.

12:58.792 --> 13:02.740
There's a new database for adopted
children looking for their birth parents.

13:02.919 --> 13:06.701
I ran a couple of old clients through,
and you hit.

13:06.879 --> 13:10.826
I double-checked this time.
It's your mother.

13:11.631 --> 13:14.997
Anyway, if you're interested,
it's 400 bucks.

13:15.173 --> 13:17.212
My new cell's on there.

13:27.219 --> 13:29.543
- Hi, doc.
- Hey, you still here?

13:29.720 --> 13:31.380
- He never leaves.
- And you do?

13:31.555 --> 13:34.506
Only because you take
so long to move.

13:35.472 --> 13:37.510
You know them?

13:37.681 --> 13:38.926
We met at lunch.

13:40.890 --> 13:43.178
- Is the smoke gonna bother you?
- No.

13:43.350 --> 13:44.891
- Hi, Luka.
- Hey.

13:45.059 --> 13:46.801
- Delirium tremens, right?
- Yeah.

13:47.518 --> 13:49.095
Abby?

13:50.977 --> 13:54.759
- Diet Coke and a couple menus, please.
- We stop serving at 10.

13:56.397 --> 13:58.886
- It's, like, 10:02.
- I'm sorry.

13:59.314 --> 14:01.221
I'm starving.

14:01.398 --> 14:05.310
- Do you have appetizers or anything?
- He may not have thrown out the soup.

14:05.482 --> 14:07.557
- What is it?
- Like a potato cream.

14:09.109 --> 14:10.566
Sure. That's fine.

14:10.734 --> 14:13.437
- All right.
- Thanks.

14:18.487 --> 14:20.644
Anyone here you don't know?

14:25.573 --> 14:27.897
You want me to put him on line
for a unit bed?

14:28.074 --> 14:31.025
He'll be extubated
by the time that he gets one.

14:32.950 --> 14:35.784
- Who is that?
- His girlfriend, I think.

14:35.951 --> 14:37.409
I'll find out what's going on.

14:37.577 --> 14:41.952
Yeah. Okay. Can you just tell them
that John is running a little bit late?

14:42.121 --> 14:46.067
Be mellow. It's good.
He's all good, okay?

14:46.247 --> 14:48.072
- Tell her he's all good.
- He's all good.

14:48.247 --> 14:50.701
- I saw him stop breathing.
- We're helping him breathe.

14:50.873 --> 14:54.536
- You don't just stop breathing.
- It's an overdose of alcohol and GHB.

14:54.708 --> 14:58.537
- He'll wake up in a few hours.
- Are those blood stains?

14:59.210 --> 15:00.489
No. Are you okay?

15:00.668 --> 15:02.825
My asthma gets worse
when I get stressed out.

15:03.002 --> 15:05.077
- Let's take a look at you.
- I need that back.

15:05.253 --> 15:07.209
Take a seat right here.

15:07.921 --> 15:10.588
I'm gonna need a good, deep breath
through your mouth.

15:10.922 --> 15:12.629
- Those are blood stains.
- They're not.

15:12.798 --> 15:15.417
- There's a body up there.
- Can you be quiet?

15:18.174 --> 15:20.924
- You have a history of heart murmur?
- No. Just asthma.

15:21.092 --> 15:22.633
- You on something?
- A little acid.

15:22.801 --> 15:25.919
- I'm not talking to you.
- No. I don't do drugs anymore.

15:26.094 --> 15:28.928
- Any fever? Chills?
- Is something wrong?

15:29.095 --> 15:31.003
Hey, don't touch that.

15:31.179 --> 15:34.925
Haleh, find her an open room. Have
somebody work her up for endocarditis.

15:35.764 --> 15:37.720
Someone? As in you?

15:43.934 --> 15:47.265
I'm Dr. Benton. My son is a patient.
The cops brought me here.

15:47.435 --> 15:50.220
No. Three waiting for Med/Surg.
What's the name?

15:50.394 --> 15:53.062
Reece Benton.
He's 4 years old. He's deaf.

15:53.228 --> 15:55.848
Right. Have a seat, please.

15:56.021 --> 15:59.353
Okay. Yeah. I'm holding here. Yes.

16:05.816 --> 16:08.222
Reece. What happened?

16:09.443 --> 16:11.434
Were you in a car?

16:11.610 --> 16:13.565
Did you hurt your head?

16:16.279 --> 16:19.231
- Can I help you?
- I'm his father. He lose consciousness?

16:19.404 --> 16:21.811
- Keep that covered.
- Was he in his car seat?

16:21.989 --> 16:24.276
- You have to talk to the doctor.
- Where's his mom?

16:24.448 --> 16:26.190
You're busy.
Tell me where she is.

16:26.365 --> 16:30.360
Dr. Benton? Julia Scoft.
So the police found you.

16:30.533 --> 16:34.031
One of the nurses thought that there
was a Benton at County with a deaf son.

16:34.201 --> 16:36.607
- What happened?
- It was a single MVA.

16:36.786 --> 16:39.109
- Where's Carla?
- Can he understand me?

16:39.286 --> 16:41.693
- Was Carla or Roger driving?
- Your wife swerved-

16:41.871 --> 16:43.612
She's not my wife.

16:43.788 --> 16:46.111
- Oh, she isn't?
- No, no. We have shared custody.

16:46.289 --> 16:49.572
Well, does she have a husband
or a close relative?

16:49.748 --> 16:53.744
- Why? What's her status?
- I really need to speak to a relative.

16:56.459 --> 16:59.127
- How many people died here today?
- I don't know.

16:59.293 --> 17:02.209
- You' re afraid to tell me.
- I honestly don't know.

17:02.378 --> 17:04.119
This place is full of dead people.

17:04.295 --> 17:06.618
Have you had any teeth
pulled recently?

17:06.796 --> 17:08.289
- No. Why?
- Any infections?

17:08.463 --> 17:11.960
- My piercing's been bothering me.
- Oh, it's so dope.

17:12.131 --> 17:13.540
Your piercing?

17:13.714 --> 17:15.587
- Where is that?
- Show him!

17:15.757 --> 17:17.002
No!

17:17.174 --> 17:18.501
- Melody-
- Harmony.

17:18.675 --> 17:22.455
I think that you might have bacteria
in your bloodstream infecting your heart.

17:23.593 --> 17:26.344
It's important that we locate the source
so we can treat it.

17:39.766 --> 17:41.141
Did you do that yourself?

17:42.725 --> 17:46.886
- No. My friend Fiona.
- How long has it been like that?

17:47.643 --> 17:51.306
Three months. She said it would take
time for the swelling to go down.

17:51.478 --> 17:54.430
Definitely infected,
and I'm gonna have to drain it.

17:54.604 --> 17:58.101
No! Don't drain her!
Don't let them drain you, Harmony!

17:58.272 --> 18:00.263
- Get her off!
- Get off! You're peaking!

18:00.439 --> 18:02.561
- Doctor!
- Dianna!

18:04.149 --> 18:05.523
Dianna!

18:11.944 --> 18:13.318
Dianna, are you okay?

18:16.237 --> 18:17.979
I'll make a new chart.

18:24.990 --> 18:27.360
What made you become a nurse?

18:28.240 --> 18:30.611
I can't remember.

18:31.076 --> 18:33.861
Ever see anything like this?

18:34.160 --> 18:36.910
- How long has it been like that?
- Two, three years.

18:37.077 --> 18:38.986
- You should get that looked at.
- So look!

18:39.162 --> 18:42.160
By a doctor. You should ask Luka.
He's good with pus.

18:45.997 --> 18:47.953
Cigarette?

18:50.832 --> 18:52.823
- No, thanks.
- You sure?

18:52.999 --> 18:55.370
Yeah. I'm trying to quit.

18:56.626 --> 18:59.578
Wanna meet for breakfast tomorrow?
We could do it early.

18:59.752 --> 19:02.667
Hey, guys! What about my toe?
I'm first!

19:02.836 --> 19:05.160
Next time you're back in town, then.

19:05.337 --> 19:06.617
I'm sorry, Dad.

19:06.796 --> 19:10.209
I'm sorry too, Dad. I'm so sorry.

19:10.380 --> 19:12.704
How long do you have to fix it
before it falls off?

19:12.881 --> 19:15.631
Dave, I need you.
Suture his toe. He's already blocked.

19:15.799 --> 19:18.004
I can't help you.
I got a chest pain rolling up.

19:18.175 --> 19:20.380
Where the hell is Chen?

19:21.176 --> 19:24.045
- Somebody go get me Chen!
- Are you talking to me?

19:24.219 --> 19:26.424
Yes, actually.
Can you find her for me, please?

19:26.595 --> 19:29.001
- Dr. Carter, Pelar is finally going up.
- Who?

19:29.179 --> 19:31.929
- The kidney stone, to Urology.
- Good for Urology.

19:32.096 --> 19:35.179
Well, Abby says she gave him gent,
but it wasn't charted.

19:35.347 --> 19:38.133
- So should I give him a dose?
- Not if she gave him one.

19:38.306 --> 19:41.176
- Then what do I do?
- Call her.

19:41.350 --> 19:42.926
She's not at home.

19:43.100 --> 19:45.257
- Call her cell.
- You got her number?

19:47.185 --> 19:49.093
You know what?

19:49.269 --> 19:51.675
I need to yell at her anyway.

19:59.981 --> 20:01.012
Hello?

20:01.524 --> 20:03.100
- Having fun?
- Carter?

20:03.274 --> 20:04.850
Are you out having a good time?

20:05.024 --> 20:07.430
No, not exactly.
What are you doing?

20:07.609 --> 20:10.524
I am setting a wrist on an " LSDiva. "

20:10.901 --> 20:12.181
You' re working?

20:12.360 --> 20:15.146
Someone talked me into coming back
and begging Weaver...

20:15.320 --> 20:17.525
...and I got sucked back in
to the ER vortex.

20:18.530 --> 20:20.520
I didn't tell you to talk to her tonight.

20:22.114 --> 20:24.070
You give gent to the kidney stone in 4?

20:24.156 --> 20:25.697
- No.
- Malik said you did.

20:25.906 --> 20:27.186
No. That was the gall-bladder guy.

20:27.366 --> 20:33.032
- I thought you had an early shift.
- I do. Luka dragged me to this bar.

20:33.201 --> 20:35.027
So much for quitting.

20:35.202 --> 20:36.909
- Oh, hey.
- What?

20:37.077 --> 20:38.654
- Who is that?
- It's Carter.

20:38.828 --> 20:41.862
- Is that Luka?
- Can you hang on a second?

20:43.705 --> 20:46.277
Things are dying down.
I'm going to Doc Magoo's.

20:46.456 --> 20:49.241
Things aren't dying down.
I've got five patients. I'm not on.

20:49.415 --> 20:51.821
Then sign out. Go home.

20:53.041 --> 20:54.997
I gotta go.

20:55.250 --> 20:58.284
- You don't need to hang up for me.
- It was about a patient.

20:58.460 --> 21:00.367
- You ready to go?
- If you want.

21:01.669 --> 21:04.621
- Yeah, Luka, I want.
- Fine.

21:05.170 --> 21:07.873
What? Now you're mad?

21:08.088 --> 21:10.791
Finish your cigarette. I'll pay the bill.

21:35.347 --> 21:38.466
Excuse me. I'm looking
for Carla McGrath.

21:41.517 --> 21:43.140
Roger.

21:43.308 --> 21:45.430
I'm sorry, man.

21:48.728 --> 21:51.182
- Is that her?
- Yeah.

21:52.645 --> 21:56.593
- Do I go in, or what?
- The doctor will be right back.

21:57.022 --> 21:58.978
What's he gonna tell me?

21:59.148 --> 22:00.557
You should just wait.

22:01.232 --> 22:03.982
Peter, come on.
What's he gonna tell me?

22:07.567 --> 22:11.432
She came in without a blood pressure.
They worked on her for over an hour...

22:11.527 --> 22:15.189
...but she had massive internal bleeding,

22:15.278 --> 22:17.021
and it was too severe to repair.

22:20.863 --> 22:22.606
Was she awake?

22:22.781 --> 22:25.352
No. She was...

22:26.116 --> 22:28.652
There was a faint pulse in the field...

22:29.992 --> 22:32.232
...but she was pretty much gone
on impact.

22:36.203 --> 22:39.154
We were supposed to go
to Wisconsin this weekend...

22:39.328 --> 22:41.237
...but I had to work last-minute.

22:45.580 --> 22:48.912
- You sure Reece is okay?
- Yeah, yeah. He cut his head, but-

22:49.082 --> 22:52.034
Mr. McGrath? Dr. Scoft.
I was the treating physician.

22:52.208 --> 22:54.578
- I'm here if you have any questions.
- Can I see her?

22:54.750 --> 22:56.409
Of course.

23:02.253 --> 23:04.659
I'm right here if you need me.

23:43.518 --> 23:45.592
Orderly to Central Supply.

23:45.684 --> 23:49.217
Orderly, please report to Central Supply.

23:52.270 --> 23:54.594
We had to trim a little hair.

23:56.439 --> 23:59.010
The doctor will be with you shortly.

24:04.566 --> 24:05.846
Mom.

24:06.026 --> 24:07.353
Reece.

24:08.568 --> 24:09.942
Mom.

24:10.110 --> 24:13.975
Mommy went away. She's gone.

24:15.946 --> 24:19.229
Mommy was hurt very badly.

24:21.406 --> 24:22.946
I can't.

24:23.323 --> 24:25.278
She was-

24:25.448 --> 24:27.191
She was bleeding.

24:27.366 --> 24:29.441
The doctor-

24:34.993 --> 24:36.784
Mommy went bye-bye.

24:39.287 --> 24:42.451
She went to be with God.

24:46.081 --> 24:48.072
I can't.

24:48.248 --> 24:51.615
She's sleeping.
She's sleeping forever.

24:51.791 --> 24:53.200
Mom.

24:53.375 --> 24:55.200
I can't.

24:55.375 --> 24:57.912
She won't wake up.

25:11.756 --> 25:15.123
Sometimes people can't wake up.

25:22.177 --> 25:24.631
Reece. Reece, Reece.

25:26.887 --> 25:28.594
Mommy died.

25:29.471 --> 25:31.068
Mommy's dead.

25:51.585 --> 25:55.283
No response to Narcan.
BP's 108/76. Pulse, 110.

25:55.461 --> 25:58.031
- Young for chest pain.
- He was complaining all day long.

25:58.212 --> 26:02.287
- Thought it was a meatball sandwich.
- On my count. One, two, three.

26:02.879 --> 26:05.202
Any history of early heart disease
in your family?

26:05.379 --> 26:06.753
Our grandmother had diabetes.

26:06.921 --> 26:09.126
CBC, chem panel, 12-lead
and a portable chest.

26:09.296 --> 26:10.493
- What's his name?
- Paul.

26:10.671 --> 26:13.208
- Paul, can you hear me?
- Pulse ox, 98.

26:13.381 --> 26:15.667
Well, no evidence of trauma.
He just collapsed?

26:15.840 --> 26:17.498
He's been pushing himself hard.

26:17.673 --> 26:19.130
His first solo show opens Monday.

26:19.215 --> 26:20.957
I haven't seen him sleep
the whole week.

26:21.132 --> 26:22.957
Does your brother do drugs?

26:23.132 --> 26:24.791
- No, I don't think so.
- Are you sure?

26:25.966 --> 26:28.750
It's the first time I've seen him
since he moved to Chicago.

26:28.925 --> 26:31.544
- All right. Let's get a tox screen.
- Here's your EKG.

26:31.717 --> 26:34.289
I don't think he would.
He's an artist, but that-

26:34.468 --> 26:37.382
ST elevations are off the charts.
He's having a major Ml.

26:37.551 --> 26:39.377
- What?
- Heart attack.

26:39.552 --> 26:41.424
- He's 27.
- It happens with stimulants.

26:41.593 --> 26:43.715
- Cocaine can constrict the arteries.
- Oh, God!

26:43.886 --> 26:45.675
40 of tenecteplase. Gotta bust the clot.

26:45.761 --> 26:48.048
I need Attending to order thrombolytics.

26:48.220 --> 26:51.005
- Let's go!
- You need to run this by Chen or Weaver.

26:51.179 --> 26:53.300
- Get one of them!
- Shooting.

26:54.512 --> 26:57.464
Pressure's dropping to 70/30.
Pulse is 130.

26:57.638 --> 26:59.962
Bolus 500 of saline. Halsted clamp.

27:00.139 --> 27:02.295
You got bleeders popping up
like prairie dogs.

27:02.472 --> 27:05.839
Pediatric pancreatic transection.
Splenic vessels won't separate.

27:06.015 --> 27:07.804
- How old?
- Seven.

27:07.973 --> 27:09.253
You're not taking the spleen?

27:09.349 --> 27:11.505
Not if I don't have to. 4-0 Vicryl.

27:11.682 --> 27:13.590
How much blood loss?

27:13.766 --> 27:15.259
Over a liter.

27:15.433 --> 27:16.677
- Dr. Corday?
- What?

27:16.766 --> 27:17.797
Taching at 140.

27:17.892 --> 27:19.634
Must've torn the splenic vein.

27:19.809 --> 27:22.345
- Side-biting clamp.
- Dr. Corday.

27:22.518 --> 27:24.094
- What?
- You're leaking.

27:25.184 --> 27:26.512
Oh, damn!

27:27.102 --> 27:29.258
- Is that breast milk?
- I should have pumped.

27:29.435 --> 27:32.185
- Is it sterile?
- No, you're contaminated. Scrub out.

27:32.728 --> 27:35.561
- Fresh gown, fresh gloves.
- It's gonna leak again. Go pump.

27:35.729 --> 27:37.435
- Hang a unit of packed cells.
- Now!

27:37.603 --> 27:39.096
Okay!

27:39.271 --> 27:41.676
What the hell does the guy want,
a suite at the Ritz?

27:41.854 --> 27:44.391
His manager freaked out
when I said we had to move him.

27:44.563 --> 27:47.645
Excuse me. I thought this guy
wasn't even famous yet.

27:47.813 --> 27:49.556
It's not about fame, jerk-off.

27:49.731 --> 27:52.302
Jim, can we clear this whole area here?
Thank you.

27:52.482 --> 27:55.645
- So, what do you want me to do?
- Find an open telemetry bed.

27:55.815 --> 27:59.016
- You gave the last one to his friend.
- All right. Any open exam room.

27:59.191 --> 28:00.518
- Fascist.
- Freak.

28:00.691 --> 28:02.019
- Geek.
- Goof.

28:02.192 --> 28:03.649
What?

28:04.066 --> 28:05.608
Okay. Where were we?

28:05.776 --> 28:07.850
Does it take this long to fix a toe?

28:07.942 --> 28:09.849
When your buddies come in OD'd, yeah.

28:10.026 --> 28:12.147
Hey, that's not my fault.

28:12.318 --> 28:13.645
Saying it's mine?

28:13.735 --> 28:16.271
You need more doctors or something.

28:16.444 --> 28:18.684
- Doctor, this is Vince Newberry's mom.
- Who?

28:18.861 --> 28:20.437
The OD you sent to telemetry.

28:20.611 --> 28:22.649
- You don't remember?
- I see lots of patients.

28:22.819 --> 28:24.147
- He almost died.
- I saved him.

28:24.320 --> 28:26.311
- Do you know my name?
- Hi, Mrs. Newberry.

28:26.487 --> 28:29.521
- What kind of doctor are you?
- Why don't we take a step over here?

28:29.696 --> 28:32.565
- I'm still here!
- I'm Dr. Carter. I treated your son.

28:32.739 --> 28:34.859
- I heard he stopped breathing.
- For a moment.

28:35.030 --> 28:36.689
We put a tube in his throat,

28:36.781 --> 28:39.151
a machine's been breathing
for him for a few hours.

28:39.323 --> 28:40.353
Is he in a coma?

28:40.448 --> 28:42.818
Not exactly. He should wake up soon.

28:43.490 --> 28:47.022
- It's that liquid G junk, isn't it?
- Along with alcohol, yes.

28:47.699 --> 28:50.271
I told him to stay away
from that stuff.

28:50.450 --> 28:52.357
It can be dangerous.

28:52.533 --> 28:55.201
- Where is he?
- Your- Your nose...

28:55.367 --> 28:56.860
- What?
- Your nose is bleeding.

28:57.034 --> 29:00.696
- Oh, damn! Not again.
- Take a seat right here.

29:00.868 --> 29:02.409
Give it a good pinch.

29:02.577 --> 29:08.408
You know, every time I get worried,
it gushes like a fountain.

29:08.620 --> 29:10.859
Shouldn't I be there?
He's having a heart attack.

29:11.036 --> 29:13.193
You have to give the doctor
room to work.

29:13.370 --> 29:16.986
- Nitro's going to 10 mics.
- Titrate to a systolic of 100.

29:17.163 --> 29:18.193
Do you need help, Dave?

29:18.288 --> 29:19.781
One 27-year-old with acute MI.

29:19.954 --> 29:22.242
I'm thinking cocaine.
We're ready to push TNK.

29:22.414 --> 29:24.701
- Hold on. Did you get a tox screen?
- I sent one.

29:24.873 --> 29:27.029
He's killing off myocardial cells
while we wait.

29:27.206 --> 29:28.912
- Any recent surgery?
- No.

29:29.082 --> 29:30.112
Bleeding disorder?

29:30.207 --> 29:31.534
Clots well at blood draw sites.

29:31.707 --> 29:32.951
- X-ray's clear.
- Dr. Chen.

29:33.123 --> 29:35.826
PCO2 and your subdural's up to 30.

29:35.916 --> 29:37.195
Oh, okay.

29:37.666 --> 29:40.830
Increase the ACU to 16
and drop him to 80 percent.

29:41.000 --> 29:45.041
- So, what about the cath lab?
- It takes them two hours to get in.

29:45.209 --> 29:46.786
- Where's Weaver?
- I can't find her.

29:46.960 --> 29:48.951
- Did you page her?
- Yeah.

29:49.127 --> 29:51.367
You want to wait for him to arrest?

29:55.628 --> 29:57.535
Okay. Do it.

29:58.628 --> 29:59.659
How about ReoPro?

29:59.754 --> 30:01.828
If Cardiology takes him for stenting.

30:01.962 --> 30:04.630
Won't need it if we lyse the thrombus.

30:04.713 --> 30:06.206
Doc, the tox screen.

30:08.839 --> 30:09.869
Cocaine, right?

30:09.964 --> 30:12.168
Negative for cocaine and amphetamines.

30:12.255 --> 30:15.089
He could've just taken them.
Haven't had time to show up.

30:15.215 --> 30:18.166
- Did you do a lipid panel?
- No, but we could add it on.

30:20.382 --> 30:22.918
- We've got V-tach.
- Charge the paddles.

30:23.091 --> 30:26.292
- No pulse. Starting compressions.
- Charge to 200. Push an amp of epi.

30:26.467 --> 30:28.872
It's too early
for a reperfusion arrhythmia.

30:30.468 --> 30:32.293
Get ready to intubate. Clear.

30:34.051 --> 30:38.046
- Still V-tach.
- Charge to 300. Page Weaver again.

30:38.218 --> 30:39.760
Clear!

30:49.663 --> 30:51.736
I'm taking a cab.

30:51.912 --> 30:54.660
- Where did you go?
- I was waiting for you outside.

30:54.827 --> 30:58.239
I thought you were coming back in. I-

31:06.823 --> 31:08.693
Sorry. That guy's father got diagnosed...

31:08.779 --> 31:10.106
with prostate cancer last month.

31:10.279 --> 31:13.062
- He was asking about treatment options.
- Go talk to him.

31:13.236 --> 31:14.776
- He's calling tomorrow.
- I'm fine.

31:14.944 --> 31:17.561
Luka, you forgot your credit card.

31:17.734 --> 31:20.020
- Thanks.
- The last two were on the house.

31:20.192 --> 31:21.767
- Oh, no. How much?
- Our treat.

31:21.941 --> 31:24.558
We want to make sure
you're gonna come back.

31:24.731 --> 31:26.804
- Here. For you.
- Thank you. Good night.

31:26.980 --> 31:28.354
- Night.
- Nice meeting you.

31:28.522 --> 31:29.764
Yeah.

31:36.017 --> 31:39.263
- Could you be a little bit more rude?
- Could you be more friendly?

31:39.433 --> 31:40.925
I'm glad one of us is.

31:41.015 --> 31:44.095
Go back inside. Cure cancer for the U.N.

31:44.264 --> 31:45.922
- Where are you going?
- Taking the El.

31:46.097 --> 31:49.212
- Still V-fib.
-100 of lidocaine. Charge again to 360.

31:49.387 --> 31:51.010
- Good breath sounds.
- There you are.

31:51.178 --> 31:52.551
- Clear!
- I am not staying.

31:52.719 --> 31:54.544
I'm going to pack
this woman's nose...

31:54.719 --> 31:57.833
...and then you are gonna take
the rest of these misfits.

31:58.008 --> 31:59.798
You're sure there wasn't Gl bleeding?

31:59.967 --> 32:02.334
Stool was guaiac negative.
No contraindications.

32:02.506 --> 32:04.461
- Clear!
- What happened?

32:05.048 --> 32:07.166
Fatal Ml. Probably drug-related.

32:07.254 --> 32:08.912
Are you sure? He looks Marfanoid.

32:09.087 --> 32:10.792
- What?
- Marfan syndrome.

32:10.961 --> 32:13.495
Tall stature, pectus excavatum,
loose joints.

32:13.668 --> 32:16.370
- You got a history.
- I did. Brother didn't say anything.

32:16.460 --> 32:17.489
He might not know.

32:17.584 --> 32:19.604
They have weak connective tissue
in the aorta.

32:19.639 --> 32:20.867
- Keep going.
- He's dissecting.

32:21.041 --> 32:22.829
Try amiodarone. Might get a rhythm.

32:22.915 --> 32:24.027
We gave tenecteplase.

32:24.122 --> 32:25.947
- What?
- He had ST elevation.

32:26.122 --> 32:27.910
Thrombolytics to an aortic dissection?

32:28.079 --> 32:29.156
We didn't know it was a dissection!

32:29.245 --> 32:31.235
He's bleeding into his chest.

32:31.411 --> 32:33.945
- Thoracotomy tray.
- No! He'll bleed all over the floor.

32:34.118 --> 32:35.396
We gotta do something.

32:35.659 --> 32:37.695
O- neg cryo and FFP.

32:37.866 --> 32:38.944
We can do a chest tube...

32:39.033 --> 32:40.904
to confirm the hemothorax
and start a line.

32:41.073 --> 32:43.691
Okay, let's go! Prep the chest.

32:45.363 --> 32:47.934
I was trying to have fun. Is that a crime?

32:48.029 --> 32:49.272
No. Go have fun.

32:49.445 --> 32:53.272
If I can be left waiting in the street,
I can certainly walk home by myself.

32:53.776 --> 32:56.016
Why do you make
a big problem out of everything?

32:56.193 --> 33:00.931
- Like you have an insect in your anus.
- Hey, it's "bug up my ass," Luka.

33:01.107 --> 33:05.145
"Bug up my ass. " If you're gonna
insult me, at least get the words right.

33:05.313 --> 33:09.519
- How's this? Stop being such a bitch.
- Okay, fine. As soon as you grow up.

33:09.687 --> 33:12.090
You're so mature.
You don't even know what you want.

33:12.268 --> 33:13.809
Yes, I do. I want to go home.

33:13.976 --> 33:17.755
You're like the schoolgirl who can have
any boy and treats them like crap.

33:17.850 --> 33:20.763
Why don't you just call me a whore
and get it over with?

33:20.931 --> 33:24.758
I'm tired of it. You're not that pretty.
You're not that special.

33:29.428 --> 33:31.335
I'm pretty enough in the dark, aren't I?

33:31.510 --> 33:34.424
You're never happy. I don't think
you're capable of being happy.

33:34.592 --> 33:36.747
Six months ago,
you didn't care if I was happy.

33:36.924 --> 33:38.914
If you're not depressed,
you're just angry.

33:39.090 --> 33:40.832
And you're married to a ghost.

33:44.630 --> 33:47.709
- At least I treat you with respect.
- Oh, I know. You're a saint.

33:48.420 --> 33:51.085
- Thora-Seal.
- I can't thread the guide wire.

33:51.252 --> 33:53.491
Rotate the bevel 90 degrees.

33:53.668 --> 33:55.574
- Damn it!
- No good.

33:55.750 --> 33:58.782
- Looks like his entire blood volume.
- How much O-neg do we have?

33:58.957 --> 34:00.200
Third and fourth unit are up.

34:00.289 --> 34:02.031
Get another four! We need that FFP!

34:02.206 --> 34:04.822
- Where is Weaver?
- We've been paging her for 15 minutes.

34:04.995 --> 34:06.323
- Doc Magoo's.
- What?

34:06.495 --> 34:08.568
She said something about
going to Doc Magoo's.

34:08.744 --> 34:12.072
Right. I know. You're always so good,
and I'm so bad.

34:12.243 --> 34:13.735
I'm sick of being patient.

34:13.824 --> 34:15.899
I'm a mess, you're so understanding.

34:16.074 --> 34:18.478
- And I'm a burden.
- Carter, your mother, your moods-

34:18.656 --> 34:22.317
- Why don't you just break up with me?
- I think you want me to.

34:22.530 --> 34:26.226
If I'm such a horrible person, how
could you possibly want to be with me?

34:26.402 --> 34:28.476
I don't know how to be with you
or help you-

34:28.652 --> 34:30.393
I don't want help.

34:30.568 --> 34:32.060
I don't want help.

34:32.235 --> 34:34.804
I don't want to be pitied.
I don't want to be saved.

34:34.983 --> 34:36.261
Okay.

34:36.440 --> 34:38.312
- Okay. I give up.
- Okay?

34:38.482 --> 34:40.351
What does that mean?

34:40.897 --> 34:42.520
What does that mean?
Why don't you-

34:42.688 --> 34:47.225
I'm done! I'm done, okay?
Carter can have you.

34:51.226 --> 34:53.014
Okay.

35:00.347 --> 35:01.839
Okay. The catheter is passing.

35:02.013 --> 35:04.714
- Any pulse with compression?
- Weak one.

35:04.887 --> 35:07.256
- Got the plasma.
- Yeah. Run it in here.

35:07.428 --> 35:10.543
- Are we cracking him or not?
- He can't clot. He'll exsanguinate.

35:10.718 --> 35:12.424
He already has.

35:12.593 --> 35:15.209
- Please get Weaver, John.
- Haleh, can you page her again?

35:15.382 --> 35:17.503
If we're gonna try this,
we gotta do it now.

35:17.674 --> 35:22.210
I am not opening his chest without
Weaver. Could you get her? Now?

35:22.713 --> 35:25.876
Okay. Go ahead, prep. 4-0 silk.

35:26.044 --> 35:27.785
- We can't wait.
- Wait!

35:29.043 --> 35:31.365
- Slow down, Doogie!
- He's got a tube in his throat!

35:31.542 --> 35:33.199
You were gonna draw a blood gas.

35:33.374 --> 35:34.653
- Is that his doctor?
- Yes.

35:34.833 --> 35:36.111
We need a private room!

36:02.030 --> 36:03.853
Dr. Weaver?

36:06.569 --> 36:08.109
Wait. Where are you?

36:08.193 --> 36:10.183
Chest-tube output is 4 liters.

36:10.276 --> 36:13.273
Ruptured aortic dissection.
We gave 40 of tenecteplase.

36:13.358 --> 36:14.387
Put the scalpel down.

36:14.482 --> 36:17.317
He's had cryoprecipitate, 4 units FFP.

36:17.352 --> 36:19.178
- He might clot.
- He'll keep lysing the thrombin.

36:19.355 --> 36:21.558
Gotta open the chest to fix the defect.

36:21.646 --> 36:23.636
It's a proximal lesion. Can't cross-clamp.

36:23.812 --> 36:27.307
- Can we try anything else?
- Stop compressions.

36:27.477 --> 36:29.134
You killed him.

36:47.718 --> 36:50.336
- Almost done, okay?
- One more.

36:50.509 --> 36:53.079
One more. Hey.

36:53.258 --> 36:58.956
You okay, Reece?
Doctor will make it better. Right?

37:03.670 --> 37:06.620
I know. Mom's gone.

37:06.794 --> 37:10.039
Finished. I'll have the nurse dress it,
and then you're free to go.

37:10.209 --> 37:12.447
All right, thanks.
I can remove the suture, right?

37:12.624 --> 37:14.531
In seven days.

37:14.707 --> 37:17.703
Listen, they're transferring her
to the morgue till morning.

37:17.872 --> 37:19.779
I've gotta find a funeral home.

37:19.955 --> 37:22.571
- You call the parents?
- Y eah, they're on their way.

37:22.744 --> 37:26.867
- Listen, Roger, tell them that I'm-
- It's cool.

37:27.035 --> 37:30.482
Can you take him tonight?
I'm gonna have to stay.

37:30.866 --> 37:33.532
Yeah. I was going to anyway.

37:33.990 --> 37:36.941
Right, right. Thanks.

37:37.614 --> 37:43.229
Reece, you have to go
with your father tonight, okay?

37:43.403 --> 37:46.814
But I'll see you tomorrow...

37:46.985 --> 37:50.977
...or the next day, okay?

37:52.773 --> 37:56.980
I love you too.

38:12.265 --> 38:14.883
You don't know
what Marfan's looks like?

38:15.056 --> 38:20.718
He's an artist. His brother said he was
up all week. I was thinking cocaine.

38:20.887 --> 38:24.749
Did you check the blood pressures
in both arms?

38:25.177 --> 38:27.083
- I don't think so.
- Did you or didn't you?

38:27.259 --> 38:28.834
No.

38:29.800 --> 38:33.459
You didn't recognize
the widened mediastinum?

38:33.631 --> 38:35.502
Not until after he arrested.

38:35.672 --> 38:39.581
Apical-capping tracheal shift to the right
is classic for a dissection.

38:39.754 --> 38:42.372
I was told that it was clear.

38:42.545 --> 38:45.114
- I meant, no hemothorax.
- Wait a minute.

38:45.292 --> 38:49.415
You didn't look at the x-ray
before you signed off on thrombolytics?

38:50.083 --> 38:52.072
Jing-Mei.

38:53.332 --> 38:54.574
Jing-Mei?

38:56.996 --> 39:00.029
- No. I should have.
- Yeah. You should have!

39:00.203 --> 39:03.697
Look, you didn't answer your page.
We had to make a quick decision.

39:03.868 --> 39:04.899
That's your job!

39:04.994 --> 39:07.741
Make quick decisions based
on the information available.

39:08.033 --> 39:11.362
You had the right information.
You didn't bother to look at it.

39:11.532 --> 39:15.191
- You've never made a bad call?
- Not as stupid and lethal as this one.

39:15.363 --> 39:18.562
Then show up and make it yourself.
We paged you three times!

39:18.737 --> 39:20.691
In a perfect world, Dr. Malucci...

39:20.861 --> 39:23.644
...I wouldn't subject
any patients to your care.

39:23.818 --> 39:26.567
If you knew your ass from your elbow,
or even gave a damn...

39:26.734 --> 39:30.393
- I do give a damn. I do give a damn.
- ... this man might still be alive!

39:30.481 --> 39:32.472
He dissected into his coronaries.

39:32.565 --> 39:35.018
He'd probably never
survive surgery anyway.

39:35.105 --> 39:38.102
Well, we'll never know that, will we?

39:38.895 --> 39:42.057
The rest of the family should be
screened. I'll talk to the brother.

39:42.227 --> 39:45.259
- Wait. Dave, I'll do it.
- No. I will.

39:45.434 --> 39:48.798
No one talks to anyone
about this case.

39:48.974 --> 39:50.881
Is that clear?

39:51.681 --> 39:54.169
- Is that clear?
- Yes.

39:55.513 --> 39:57.338
Ice that back, Carter.

40:39.910 --> 40:42.612
- Get up and help me! Mark!
- What?

40:42.785 --> 40:44.277
Get up and help me!

40:44.451 --> 40:47.649
There's poop all over the bassinet.
It's running down her legs.

40:47.824 --> 40:51.519
- You didn't tighten the bloody diaper!
- God! What time is it?

40:51.697 --> 40:54.481
- Now!
- Okay, okay, okay.

40:54.655 --> 40:58.350
- I heard her crying from downstairs!
- I'm sorry. I must have passed out.

40:58.528 --> 41:00.980
- I told you to double up!
- I thought I did.

41:01.152 --> 41:04.681
- Look at this!
- Calm down. It's not fatal.

41:04.858 --> 41:08.767
Yeah, okay! You take her!
I'll run her bath.

41:08.940 --> 41:12.056
Why don't you just go back to bed,
and I'll take care of her?

41:12.231 --> 41:13.557
Don't make me the bitch...

41:13.646 --> 41:15.850
just because you can't follow
simple instructions!

41:16.021 --> 41:17.974
I was just offering to take care of it.

41:18.061 --> 41:20.845
Splendid job you've done of it so far!

41:21.019 --> 41:25.010
Fine. You take care of it.
I've got a shift in three hours.

41:25.808 --> 41:29.303
What do you think I'll be doing
in three hours? I'm the feeding trough!

41:29.474 --> 41:35.337
- If I could breast-feed, I would.
- Oh, great. Great! You take it!

41:35.512 --> 41:40.214
Take it all! The sore nipples,
the rashes, the hemorrhoids...

41:40.385 --> 41:43.168
...the leaking in your trauma gown,
the public humiliation...

41:43.342 --> 41:48.921
...sleep deprivation, the incontinence,
for goodness' sake. It's all yours!

41:53.546 --> 41:55.418
There you go.

41:55.587 --> 41:58.370
Watch out for that volcano next time.

41:58.960 --> 42:01.626
Malik, can you dress that toe
and fit him for a cast shoe?

42:01.792 --> 42:03.996
Sorry, I'm off.

42:12.996 --> 42:15.318
Can I help you?

42:15.495 --> 42:17.734
Did anyone turn in a pager?

42:17.911 --> 42:20.612
No. I don't think so.

42:40.318 --> 42:42.983
Carter, I saw your lady
with the nose bleed.

42:43.149 --> 42:45.305
I'm scheduling her
for a septoplasty next week.

42:45.483 --> 42:48.681
- She had a defect?
- That you could drive a truck through.

42:48.856 --> 42:51.521
I guess 2 grams of coke a day
will do that.

42:51.688 --> 42:55.182
- Nap yet?
- I was supposed to be off last night.

42:55.353 --> 42:57.757
You're not in Surgery.
Don't punish yourself. Go.

42:57.935 --> 43:00.339
No. I'm on at noon.
I'm just gonna go pass out.

43:00.517 --> 43:03.183
Bad idea. You know what they say:

43:03.350 --> 43:07.060
"The longer you stay,
the longer you stay. "

43:09.980 --> 43:12.516
Conni, I need you to dress a toe
for me in Curtain 2.

43:12.688 --> 43:15.094
- After my break.
- Y eah, whenever.

43:47.395 --> 43:49.765
Reece, what's wrong?

43:50.978 --> 43:52.257
Bad dreams?

43:53.978 --> 43:56.099
You want to sleep here?

44:00.311 --> 44:03.759
Okay. It's okay. It's okay.
