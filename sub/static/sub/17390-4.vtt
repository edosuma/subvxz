WEBVTT

00:02.953 --> 00:04.386
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, yeah!

00:06.136 --> 00:07.343
Oh, this is the life, huh?

00:07.368 --> 00:08.953
A couple beers, game on TV.

00:08.978 --> 00:10.403
Yeah, I opened a bottle of wine

00:10.428 --> 00:11.428
in the kitchen for the ladies.

00:11.453 --> 00:13.720
They should be good for an hour.

00:14.599 --> 00:16.265
More like a half hour.

00:17.268 --> 00:20.837
Yeah, I may need to feed the meter.

00:21.425 --> 00:23.539
Change the channel, we want
to watch that dancing show.

00:23.541 --> 00:25.988
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:26.013 --> 00:28.246
Daddy and Uncle Don
are watching football.

00:28.446 --> 00:30.179
So no talking.

00:32.570 --> 00:33.570
Who's that guy?

00:33.572 --> 00:35.639
Teddy, that's talking.

00:35.935 --> 00:37.605
Commercial! Switch it
to the dancing show.

00:37.630 --> 00:40.477
No, no, if I switch
it, it'll never go back.

00:40.479 --> 00:41.648
I used that trick on your mother

00:41.673 --> 00:43.205
during the Royal Wedding.

00:43.877 --> 00:44.759
Just watch

00:44.784 --> 00:46.227
- the commercials.
- That's right.

00:46.252 --> 00:48.519
- It's good for the economy.
- Mm.

00:50.275 --> 00:54.011
Hey, look, that old guy
just took a blue pill.

00:55.661 --> 00:57.540
And now that lady likes him.

01:00.970 --> 01:03.434
What kind of pill is that, Uncle Don?

01:07.873 --> 01:10.641
Oh, it's a magical pill.

01:12.620 --> 01:15.145
What does it do?

01:19.056 --> 01:21.190
- And we're out.
- Yep.

01:23.196 --> 01:24.663
Okay, remember the blue pill.

01:24.665 --> 01:26.064
We can use that again.

01:27.369 --> 01:28.861
Oh, hey, we had a great idea.

01:28.886 --> 01:29.904
We're starting a book club.

01:29.929 --> 01:30.895
Yeah, you want to hear about it?

01:30.920 --> 01:33.120
Keep walking, keep walking.

01:35.008 --> 01:36.841
Well, this isn't so bad.

01:36.843 --> 01:38.755
We can still see the game
through our neighbor's window.

01:38.780 --> 01:39.845
Yeah.

01:40.486 --> 01:42.247
And old man Ferguson

01:42.249 --> 01:44.783
isn't wearing pants.

01:44.785 --> 01:46.744
Neither is Mrs. Ferguson.

01:48.205 --> 01:49.640
Maybe just go ahead and turn this way

01:49.665 --> 01:51.356
- for a little while.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:51.358 --> 01:53.525
You know, I can't believe
we're stuck out here.

01:53.527 --> 01:55.093
We need a place to hang.

01:55.095 --> 01:56.461
You know, nothing fancy.

01:56.463 --> 01:58.193
Just a place with some walls

01:58.218 --> 01:59.597
where we can look in any direction

01:59.599 --> 02:01.099
and not be scarred for life.

02:02.314 --> 02:04.773
Hey... why don't we fix up your garage?

02:04.798 --> 02:05.749
It'd be perfect.

02:05.751 --> 02:07.817
Don, don't even bother.

02:11.289 --> 02:13.256
Our problem may be solved after all.

02:13.258 --> 02:15.825
Looks like your wife's
packing up to leave you.

02:17.362 --> 02:18.595
No, she just...

02:18.597 --> 02:20.582
she just never throws
anything away, ever.

02:20.607 --> 02:22.198
All right, come on, let's just
start throwing this junk out.

02:22.200 --> 02:23.637
No, no, no, no, we can't.

02:23.662 --> 02:25.070
Andi will lose her mind.

02:25.095 --> 02:26.871
There'd be a lot of yelling.

02:26.896 --> 02:29.190
But you won't hear it,
'cause you'll be out here.

02:30.425 --> 02:32.776
Besides, you worked your butt
off when she went back to work.

02:32.778 --> 02:34.010
Where's your payback?

02:34.012 --> 02:35.278
Well, my payback is supposed to be

02:35.280 --> 02:36.980
spending more time with the kids.

02:36.982 --> 02:39.516
She made it sound like a fun thing.

02:39.518 --> 02:41.184
Think about what we could do out here.

02:41.186 --> 02:43.353
We could get an old
motorcycle and fix it up.

02:43.355 --> 02:45.221
Like we used to do in high school.

02:45.223 --> 02:46.489
Yeah, come on, let's do it.

02:46.491 --> 02:48.224
Tell Andi to get her stuff out of here.

02:48.226 --> 02:50.372
Yeah, yeah, she doesn't get to decide.

02:50.397 --> 02:51.705
No, sir, she does not!

02:51.730 --> 02:52.781
No, I decide.

02:52.806 --> 02:54.608
And I've decided we're doing it.

02:54.633 --> 02:55.699
- Damn straight.
- Yeah!

02:55.701 --> 02:56.933
Andi needs to know

02:56.935 --> 02:59.423
that the garage is a man's place.

02:59.448 --> 03:01.643
- What's that, honey?
- Oh, uh, nothing, sweetie.

03:01.668 --> 03:03.367
Drinky-drinky, love you.

03:05.000 --> 03:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:17.371 --> 03:20.605
Okay, Andi, when you look at this...

03:21.622 --> 03:23.208
how do you feel?

03:24.314 --> 03:25.399
I love it.

03:27.073 --> 03:28.366
These are our memories.

03:28.391 --> 03:31.251
It makes me feel safe and warm.

03:31.276 --> 03:32.657
It might make you feel warm 'cause

03:32.682 --> 03:35.098
it's a fire hazard.

03:35.100 --> 03:37.329
I say we clean all
this stuff out of here

03:37.354 --> 03:39.536
so Don and I can have a hangout and,

03:39.764 --> 03:42.936
I don't know, maybe
rebuild an old motorcycle.

03:45.460 --> 03:46.795
You have got to be kidding me.

03:46.820 --> 03:48.757
You... you want me to
throw out all my stuff

03:48.782 --> 03:51.448
so you and your brother
can have a motorcycle fort?

03:52.132 --> 03:54.365
Well, we're not calling it that.

03:54.390 --> 03:55.992
Look, you told me when you went

03:56.017 --> 03:57.850
back to work I'd get
more time with the kids,

03:57.852 --> 03:59.251
and that would be a fun thing.

03:59.253 --> 04:01.086
Can we both agree

04:01.088 --> 04:03.055
that that was a lie?

04:03.584 --> 04:04.890
Yes, that was a lie.

04:05.262 --> 04:08.137
I just, I need a spot to decompress.

04:08.162 --> 04:09.962
You already have the bathroom.

04:09.964 --> 04:11.743
Every time I go in there,

04:11.768 --> 04:13.968
Emme sings to me through the door.

04:14.068 --> 04:15.797
Now, whenever I hear
"The Wheels on the Bus,"

04:15.822 --> 04:17.822
it triggers something.

04:18.726 --> 04:21.906
Look, Andi, I'm asking
you to do this for me.

04:22.523 --> 04:23.909
Fine.

04:23.911 --> 04:25.311
Let's try and clean this place out,

04:25.313 --> 04:28.514
so you can have your dork fort.

04:28.516 --> 04:30.816
Great, but we're not
calling it that, either.

04:31.278 --> 04:34.787
Okay, first up is,
uh... okay, camping gear.

04:34.789 --> 04:38.757
Huh? Only used once. Total disaster.

04:38.759 --> 04:41.537
Teddy ate too many s'mores,
and then he threw up.

04:41.562 --> 04:43.295
Then Emme saw his throw-up,

04:43.431 --> 04:44.897
and then she threw up.

04:44.899 --> 04:48.434
And then Katie fainted
into the throw-up.

04:49.230 --> 04:51.070
See, that is a great family story,

04:51.072 --> 04:53.425
which you remembered because
you saw the camping gear.

04:53.450 --> 04:54.473
It stays.

04:55.497 --> 04:56.875
Okay, uh...

04:57.373 --> 04:58.692
Okay, this should be easy.

04:58.717 --> 05:00.036
No one could possibly care about

05:00.061 --> 05:01.947
a giant container of wine corks.

05:01.972 --> 05:03.525
My corks!

05:05.502 --> 05:07.686
Martha Stewart has all
kinds of ideas for these.

05:07.688 --> 05:09.590
I'm gonna make a
wine-cork collage someday.

05:09.615 --> 05:11.849
Is it gonna be a picture of you
passed out on the kitchen table?

05:15.341 --> 05:17.678
Okay, so, six hours of work,

05:17.703 --> 05:19.102
and the only thing that left the garage

05:19.127 --> 05:21.427
was a cricket that
hopped out on its own.

05:22.900 --> 05:24.747
Honey, I think you might
be like one of those people

05:24.772 --> 05:26.407
on that TV show you make me watch.

05:26.432 --> 05:28.807
Don't say Hoarders. I am not a hoarder.

05:29.837 --> 05:32.180
I love you too much to
say the name of the show

05:32.205 --> 05:34.405
that describes you perfectly.

05:37.008 --> 05:38.183
Honey,

05:38.333 --> 05:41.351
the other night, I was
banished to the driveway.

05:41.376 --> 05:44.837
And Don and I witnessed
Mr. and Mrs. Ferguson

05:44.862 --> 05:47.593
making old, grey,

05:47.595 --> 05:50.829
surprisingly agile love.

05:51.357 --> 05:54.066
Is your stuff really worth all that?

05:54.068 --> 05:55.913
I know you want me to say no.

05:55.938 --> 05:57.371
Oh, come on, Andi.

05:57.678 --> 06:00.139
- Most of it's just junk.
- Okay, but...

06:00.141 --> 06:02.107
what if while we're
throwing out the junk,

06:02.109 --> 06:04.076
we accidentally throw
out something important?

06:04.078 --> 06:06.411
You see, the junk keeps all
the important stuff safe.

06:06.436 --> 06:08.029
It's like padding.

06:10.350 --> 06:12.017
Yeah. You know, uh...

06:12.626 --> 06:13.852
before we got married,

06:13.854 --> 06:16.091
your dad wanted to have
a little talk with me.

06:16.116 --> 06:18.855
And I never did it, and now
I know what it was about.

06:21.362 --> 06:22.698
Look, I want to do this.

06:22.723 --> 06:24.063
I want you to have your own space.

06:24.088 --> 06:26.244
It's just... it's really hard for me.

06:26.269 --> 06:28.609
Then let me make this easy.
I'll clean out the garage

06:28.634 --> 06:30.868
on my own, and you don't
have to worry about a thing.

06:31.005 --> 06:32.938
You would have no
idea what to throw away

06:32.940 --> 06:33.794
and what to keep.

06:33.819 --> 06:35.052
Well, don't you trust me?

06:35.077 --> 06:36.710
No! Not at all.

06:37.910 --> 06:38.570
I'm sorry.

06:38.595 --> 06:39.916
Have I been unclear?

06:41.247 --> 06:44.815
Wow. Hoarders are mean.

06:45.632 --> 06:47.666
Honey, I'm sorry, okay?

06:47.754 --> 06:50.154
Look, I clearly have a problem.

06:50.156 --> 06:54.355
We... Well, that's very
brave of you to admit.

06:54.380 --> 06:55.730
And I think the only way out of this...

06:55.755 --> 06:57.421
I mean, as far as I can see...

06:57.663 --> 06:59.597
is that, uh, we meet back here

06:59.599 --> 07:01.899
in a year and continue this discussion.

07:07.794 --> 07:09.527
If you have a minute,
I'd like to talk more

07:09.552 --> 07:11.263
about this blue pill?

07:19.200 --> 07:21.491
Let's meet back here in a
year, and we'll talk about it.

07:26.504 --> 07:28.790
So, Andi didn't want us
cleaning out the garage,

07:28.815 --> 07:30.081
and we're doing it anyway?

07:30.083 --> 07:31.618
No, no. She does want it.

07:31.643 --> 07:33.318
She just doesn't know she wants it.

07:33.320 --> 07:34.901
Like, when she threw out my cargo pants.

07:34.926 --> 07:36.755
Oh, don't tell the cargo
pants story again, please.

07:36.757 --> 07:39.462
I love my cargo pants.

07:39.548 --> 07:41.683
So many pockets, and zippers,

07:41.708 --> 07:45.000
and snaps and Velcro, and
I had them in every color.

07:45.025 --> 07:47.859
I had them in light
khaki, dark khaki, khaki.

07:47.968 --> 07:50.769
I had them in tan, light tan, dark tan.

07:50.771 --> 07:53.471
And then one day, Andi
just threw them away.

07:53.473 --> 07:56.875
And at first, I was
mad. But then I noticed,

07:56.877 --> 07:59.778
I wasn't getting caught
on doorknobs anymore.

07:59.780 --> 08:02.447
Literally, the most boring story ever.

08:02.449 --> 08:04.745
My point is she helped me,

08:04.770 --> 08:06.348
even though I didn't know I needed help,

08:06.373 --> 08:07.685
and now I'm helping her.

08:07.687 --> 08:10.221
And if I'm careful, and
I save the right stuff,

08:10.223 --> 08:11.890
I'm sure she'll be happy.

08:12.154 --> 08:13.858
If you're so sure, why
are we sneaking around

08:13.860 --> 08:15.193
while she's at book club?

08:15.790 --> 08:16.700
Because I'm not sure.

08:16.725 --> 08:18.291
I'm just doing it anyway.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.474
Oh! Check it out!

08:21.499 --> 08:24.036
Motorcycle's coming today.
Wait till you see it.

08:24.061 --> 08:26.591
A '61 Triumph, just like
the kind Steve McQueen had.

08:26.616 --> 08:27.846
- Whoa.
- Yeah?

08:27.871 --> 08:29.117
You know what that makes us?

08:29.142 --> 08:31.995
Exactly as cool as Steve McQueen.

08:32.020 --> 08:33.211
Oh, spider web, spider web.

08:33.236 --> 08:36.370
Oh! Spider! Spider! Don, get it.

08:36.395 --> 08:37.340
Get it together.

08:37.365 --> 08:38.847
We're motorcycle people now.

08:38.873 --> 08:40.926
- Yeah.
- All right, we got a lot of boxes here

08:40.951 --> 08:42.486
with old clothes... what do
you want me to do with these?

08:42.489 --> 08:43.510
Keep or donate?

08:43.534 --> 08:45.434
I don't know. This is taking too long.

08:45.459 --> 08:47.692
We got to be done by the time
Andi gets back, so just...

08:47.694 --> 08:49.654
donate, donate, donate and hurry.

08:49.679 --> 08:51.822
I'm hurrying. If you didn't
tell that cargo pants story,

08:51.847 --> 08:53.262
we'd be done by now.

08:53.942 --> 08:55.600
I had cargo shorts, too, you know.

08:55.602 --> 08:57.068
Oh, I'd love to hear about that.

08:57.093 --> 08:58.903
- Oh, yeah, they were great.
- Oh, yeah?

08:58.905 --> 09:01.139
- Zip-off legs, yeah. 
- Oh, sweet.

09:02.905 --> 09:03.541
You don't think

09:03.543 --> 09:05.541
this bike is me having a
mid-life crisis, do you?

09:05.566 --> 09:08.075
No! No, no. You're way past mid-life.

09:08.100 --> 09:09.165
Oh, good.

09:10.163 --> 09:10.944
Hey.

09:10.969 --> 09:11.910
Hey, fellas.

09:11.935 --> 09:13.311
Don, you know Lowell, right?

09:13.336 --> 09:14.702
Sure, he's the dad from school

09:14.727 --> 09:17.061
who imprinted on you like a baby duck.

09:17.742 --> 09:20.892
Your brother's really had a
bracing, masculine effect on me.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.112
Today, when my wife

09:22.137 --> 09:24.262
said good morning, I
just grunted at her.

09:24.264 --> 09:25.866
It was not well received.

09:25.891 --> 09:27.718
Hoping I can hang here a while.

09:27.743 --> 09:29.876
Sure. Oh, here comes Andi.

09:29.901 --> 09:32.869
- Start a wine club.
- Ooh!

09:35.031 --> 09:36.066
What did you do?

09:36.091 --> 09:37.221
Okay, before you freak out...

09:37.246 --> 09:38.855
No, no. What happened here?

09:38.880 --> 09:39.867
Where's all my stuff?

09:39.892 --> 09:41.547
- Let me explain.
- No, no, no. You just...

09:41.572 --> 09:42.555
you threw it all out?

09:42.580 --> 09:45.083
No! Well, yeah.

09:45.896 --> 09:48.167
Look, I only did it because
I felt like you couldn't,

09:48.192 --> 09:50.221
even though you wanted
to, like our vow said,

09:50.223 --> 09:53.057
"In sickness, and in health," and honey,

09:53.277 --> 09:55.010
you have a little sickness.

09:55.215 --> 09:56.958
I? I have a sickness.

09:56.983 --> 09:58.952
I have a sickness? You throw away

09:58.977 --> 10:00.194
- my precious memories,
- Wait, just...

10:00.219 --> 10:01.714
- and I have a sickness?
- I...

10:01.739 --> 10:03.497
I think you broke your wife.

10:03.904 --> 10:05.637
I just, I can't believe it's all gone.

10:05.639 --> 10:06.905
Well, no, not all of it.

10:06.907 --> 10:08.571
No. Like, see that section over there?

10:08.596 --> 10:10.829
That's all corks.

10:13.242 --> 10:15.957
Really? I'm-I'm supposed to be
happy about corks, right now?

10:16.525 --> 10:17.348
Are you?

10:18.439 --> 10:19.884
A little.

10:20.623 --> 10:23.487
Look, yeah, and over
here, I made keepsake boxes

10:23.512 --> 10:25.023
for all the kids.

10:25.025 --> 10:28.393
You should be even happier
about that, hopefully.

10:29.329 --> 10:30.949
I guess that's not a bad idea.

10:30.974 --> 10:34.242
Yeah, yeah, tiny clothes,
tiny footprints, tiny teeth.

10:34.267 --> 10:37.268
You name something tiny, I kept it.

10:37.819 --> 10:39.549
I do like tiny things.

10:39.574 --> 10:41.774
- That's...
- Shut up, Don.

10:42.683 --> 10:46.344
Oh, Kate's first ice skates.

10:46.369 --> 10:48.414
Oh, I haven't seen these in years.

10:48.439 --> 10:50.773
That's because they were buried.

10:50.909 --> 10:53.056
Look, I-I'm not taking
away your memories,

10:53.081 --> 10:54.180
I'm giving 'em back to you

10:54.205 --> 10:56.705
by getting rid of all the junk.

10:57.410 --> 10:59.090
Okay, well, I'm starting

10:59.092 --> 11:00.911
to picture my life with you again.

11:01.599 --> 11:03.939
Good. 'Cause I was prepared
to make a run for it.

11:03.964 --> 11:05.296
I got $200 bucks in my pocket

11:05.298 --> 11:06.831
and I already kissed the kids good-bye.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.500
Hey, good for you guys.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.836
I believe I was promised wine.

11:13.640 --> 11:16.088
Oh, and I-I found a bunch
of stuff from our wedding.

11:16.113 --> 11:17.279
I know you like that day,

11:17.304 --> 11:18.639
'cause that's the day you got me.

11:20.036 --> 11:21.202
How'd he pull that off?

11:21.227 --> 11:22.394
Adam Burns...

11:22.419 --> 11:24.147
he's all balls.

11:25.251 --> 11:26.851
Oh, my God.

11:26.853 --> 11:28.953
Look at these wedding pictures.

11:28.955 --> 11:30.355
Oh, ladies.

11:30.357 --> 11:31.897
Paste on some fake smiles,

11:31.922 --> 11:34.108
I found something more
boring to do than reading.

11:34.350 --> 11:35.293
Oh, wait, wait.

11:35.295 --> 11:37.028
Uh, what do you want me to
do with this wedding box?

11:37.030 --> 11:39.197
Um, just put it with my wedding dress.

11:39.199 --> 11:40.021
Your wedding dress?

11:40.046 --> 11:41.479
Uh, will do.

11:44.219 --> 11:45.963
What wedding dress? I
didn't see a wedding dress!

11:45.988 --> 11:48.306
Did you see a wedding dress?
I bet you threw it away.

11:48.308 --> 11:50.540
Hey, you were the one yelling,
"Donate, donate, donate!"

11:50.565 --> 11:52.866
Yeah, because you said it
was just all old clothes.

11:52.891 --> 11:54.390
Oh, you're not taking me down for this.

11:54.514 --> 11:56.014
If Marcy sees Andi yelling at you,

11:56.016 --> 11:57.749
she's gonna want to yell at me.

11:57.751 --> 11:58.820
It's animal instinct.

11:58.845 --> 12:00.544
Like a wolf hearing another wolf howl.

12:01.186 --> 12:01.866
Guys,

12:01.891 --> 12:02.930
guys, stop fighting.

12:02.955 --> 12:03.987
It's not helping anything

12:04.012 --> 12:05.912
and it totally excludes me.

12:06.557 --> 12:07.392
This is bad.

12:07.394 --> 12:08.562
This is very, very bad.

12:08.587 --> 12:10.020
That wedding dress isn't in here.

12:10.130 --> 12:11.596
Well, then, it must
be at the thrift store.

12:11.894 --> 12:12.902
You're right.

12:12.927 --> 12:14.721
Okay, we got to get down there
before someone else buys it.

12:14.746 --> 12:16.174
All right, Lowell, you tell Andi that

12:16.199 --> 12:17.565
Don and I had to run an errand.

12:17.590 --> 12:18.602
- Yeah?
- Okay. Yeah.

12:18.627 --> 12:20.835
I'll tell her you went
to get some loose tea.

12:20.907 --> 12:21.796
What?

12:21.821 --> 12:23.294
- No!
- Hardware store?

12:23.319 --> 12:24.585
- Yes.
- I did it.

12:34.417 --> 12:35.617
Hey, uh, hi. Uh,

12:35.619 --> 12:36.818
where are your wedding dresses?

12:36.820 --> 12:38.019
I don't know.

12:38.136 --> 12:39.435
Do you even work here?

12:39.460 --> 12:41.456
Yes, but it's not my passion.

12:42.647 --> 12:44.726
Listen, buddy, do you have
wedding dresses or not?

12:44.728 --> 12:47.095
Some lady's in the
dressing room trying one on.

12:47.097 --> 12:48.252
You could've led with that.

12:48.277 --> 12:50.911
But then we wouldn't have had this.

12:52.212 --> 12:52.867
That's it.

12:52.869 --> 12:54.946
- That's the dress.
- Okay, I got this. I got this.

12:55.652 --> 12:57.338
Uh, ma'am?

12:57.635 --> 13:00.041
Hi, I'm a little bit of an
expert on wedding dresses.

13:00.043 --> 13:01.509
And I got to say,

13:01.628 --> 13:03.728
if I'm at the alter, watching
that thing come at me,

13:03.753 --> 13:06.254
I'm gonna throw myself
through a stained glass window.

13:07.050 --> 13:08.258
Excuse me?

13:08.283 --> 13:10.576
Yeah, uh-uh, look, I have
to apologize for my brother.

13:10.601 --> 13:11.853
What he meant to say was,

13:11.855 --> 13:13.755
you're way too pretty for that dress.

13:13.757 --> 13:15.657
Well, you're too ugly for that shirt.

13:16.988 --> 13:18.693
Hey, I-I said something nice.

13:19.336 --> 13:20.569
Look, sunshine,

13:21.109 --> 13:22.987
you seem like an unhappy
person in general,

13:23.012 --> 13:25.533
you throw marriage in the mix,
it's only downhill from there.

13:26.314 --> 13:27.204
Okay, ma'am, look,

13:27.229 --> 13:28.812
I-I made a terrible mistake.

13:28.837 --> 13:30.805
First of all, I brought my brother here.

13:30.807 --> 13:32.473
Hey, what's up?

13:33.610 --> 13:35.805
And-and-and second, I accidentally

13:35.830 --> 13:37.786
donated my wife's wedding dress

13:37.811 --> 13:38.818
and you're wearing it.

13:38.843 --> 13:40.300
And it means the world to her

13:40.325 --> 13:41.950
and she means the world to me.

13:41.952 --> 13:43.651
So I-I need it back.

13:44.025 --> 13:46.567
Oh, that's so sweet.

13:46.592 --> 13:48.289
I mean, I'd be happy to give it you

13:48.291 --> 13:50.291
for $500.

13:51.298 --> 13:53.061
You really think
extortion is gonna work?

13:53.063 --> 13:55.897
How do you think I got
this ring on my finger?

13:56.672 --> 13:58.046
I take back what I said.

13:58.071 --> 14:00.401
You're going to enjoy
marriage very much.

14:02.038 --> 14:03.545
Oh God, I forgot how much

14:03.570 --> 14:04.955
I love that dress.

14:04.980 --> 14:08.681
Oh, I could show you a picture
of what I wore to my divorce.

14:09.968 --> 14:11.336
Or I could just put on a bathrobe,

14:11.361 --> 14:12.771
and you'd get it.

14:13.626 --> 14:15.049
Hey, do you guys want to see my dress?

14:15.051 --> 14:16.084
Uh!

14:18.788 --> 14:19.821
Lowell, are you okay?

14:20.309 --> 14:21.656
Never better.

14:22.184 --> 14:23.191
Okay, well I'll go get it.

14:23.193 --> 14:25.426
No, no! You can't go out there!

14:26.402 --> 14:28.229
W-What are you doing?

14:28.231 --> 14:29.416
I'm just going upstairs

14:29.441 --> 14:31.208
to get my dress out of the closet.

14:33.003 --> 14:34.302
It's in your closet?

14:34.857 --> 14:36.337
Of course, it's in a box on a shelf,

14:36.339 --> 14:37.658
where it's been for 15 years.

14:37.683 --> 14:40.050
What? What is going on, Lowell?

14:43.136 --> 14:44.278
Nothing.

14:48.049 --> 14:49.617
Doesn't seem like nothing.

14:51.021 --> 14:52.453
Is it something Adam did?

14:53.560 --> 14:55.423
Something Don did?

14:57.200 --> 14:59.127
Something Adam and Don did?

15:00.397 --> 15:02.964
Nope. Nothing to report.

15:10.306 --> 15:12.273
This man's a liar.

15:14.145 --> 15:15.343
Yeah, are you gonna tell us, Lowell,

15:15.345 --> 15:17.166
or am I gonna let
Marcy get it out of you?

15:17.191 --> 15:18.446
Fine.

15:18.448 --> 15:20.228
Adam thinks he donated
your wedding dress

15:20.253 --> 15:21.315
while he was cleaning out the garage,

15:21.317 --> 15:22.984
so he went to the thrift
store to buy your dress back,

15:22.986 --> 15:23.985
but I guess it's not your dress

15:23.987 --> 15:25.941
since your actual dress is upstairs.

15:26.074 --> 15:28.222
Whew. I feel light as a feather.

15:30.292 --> 15:31.426
So Adam lied to me.

15:32.326 --> 15:33.795
I should go.

15:35.404 --> 15:36.230
Um...

15:36.232 --> 15:38.199
totally unrelated...

15:38.325 --> 15:41.560
anyone know where the thrift store is?

15:43.873 --> 15:45.673
I'll figure it out.

15:46.876 --> 15:49.500
Okay, I got $282 here.

15:49.525 --> 15:50.445
Is that enough for you?

15:50.447 --> 15:53.614
Let's make it $284.

15:54.918 --> 15:57.952
Sold... to the bad husband
with the hot brother.

16:00.290 --> 16:01.689
Accidentally hooked her.

16:01.980 --> 16:03.996
I can't believe it...
I got the dress back!

16:04.699 --> 16:06.390
Hey, do you guys mind watching the store

16:06.415 --> 16:07.748
while I grab a taco?

16:10.475 --> 16:12.038
- Yeah, sure, man, okay.
- Yeah.

16:18.212 --> 16:19.941
I can't believe I pulled this off.

16:19.943 --> 16:21.556
Yeah, it's a shame you
won't get any credit

16:21.581 --> 16:22.909
- for your hard work.
- What?

16:22.934 --> 16:23.678
Always remember,

16:23.680 --> 16:24.746
there's nothing more important

16:24.748 --> 16:26.647
in a marriage than keeping score.

16:34.042 --> 16:35.890
Hello, boys.

16:37.966 --> 16:40.161
And that's game over.

16:42.314 --> 16:43.541
Adam!

16:44.320 --> 16:46.568
Did a handsome man come in here
looking for a wedding dress?

16:46.593 --> 16:47.769
You just missed him.

16:47.771 --> 16:50.671
But I'll buy those red
pants for two dollars.

16:52.837 --> 16:54.236
What a weird day.

16:56.290 --> 16:58.145
Let me get the chain of events straight.

16:58.817 --> 17:01.449
So, you went behind my
back and you did something

17:01.474 --> 17:03.117
you knew I didn't want you to do.

17:03.251 --> 17:05.948
Yup, I-I did do that,
but in my defense,

17:05.973 --> 17:07.761
you did the exact same
thing to me with my...

17:07.786 --> 17:09.653
Don't you dare say cargo pants.

17:11.750 --> 17:13.150
Multipocketed trousers.

17:14.861 --> 17:15.663
And then,

17:15.688 --> 17:18.662
when you thought you threw
away my wedding dress,

17:18.686 --> 17:19.534
you lied to me.

17:19.536 --> 17:20.768
Look, this didn't work out

17:20.770 --> 17:22.403
great for me, either, you know.

17:22.405 --> 17:25.205
I spent $280 on the wrong dress.

17:25.909 --> 17:27.108
That was my getaway money.

17:27.109 --> 17:29.076
I could really use that right now.

17:30.487 --> 17:31.690
See, this is why we need

17:31.715 --> 17:32.660
to keep our things,

17:32.685 --> 17:34.806
so we can be reminded
of, oh, I don't know,

17:34.831 --> 17:36.150
what my wedding dress looks like.

17:36.152 --> 17:37.479
I mean, does your...

17:37.504 --> 17:39.192
thrift store dress

17:39.217 --> 17:41.484
look anything like this?

17:49.196 --> 17:50.431
No.

17:53.118 --> 17:55.403
I can't believe I lost my wedding dress.

17:56.180 --> 17:57.538
I am a hoarder.

17:58.628 --> 18:00.495
Don't be so hard on yourself.

18:00.700 --> 18:03.177
Literally everyone in this room

18:03.179 --> 18:05.813
has lost your wedding dress
at one time or another.

18:07.538 --> 18:08.711
Okay, wait a minute.

18:08.736 --> 18:10.836
Now, if-if my dress
box was full of corks,

18:11.087 --> 18:12.687
that means I took the dress out

18:13.071 --> 18:14.822
and I put it where the corks were...

18:14.949 --> 18:16.618
which was in the garage.

18:16.813 --> 18:17.458
So...

18:17.736 --> 18:19.346
you did donate my dress

18:19.371 --> 18:20.064
and that means

18:20.089 --> 18:21.671
in this bag is...

18:22.356 --> 18:24.832
still not my dress!

18:25.746 --> 18:27.735
How is this possible?

18:28.337 --> 18:29.140
Ugh.

18:30.376 --> 18:32.640
So, you don't have the dress.

18:32.941 --> 18:34.697
Now, come on, it's just a thing.

18:35.056 --> 18:36.544
Huh? And...

18:36.732 --> 18:37.913
things don't matter

18:37.938 --> 18:39.942
because we have our memories.

18:40.137 --> 18:41.172
Huh? I remember

18:41.197 --> 18:43.184
everything about our wedding day.

18:43.799 --> 18:45.119
You do?

18:45.170 --> 18:46.803
How could I forget?

18:47.789 --> 18:49.688
The way you wore your hair with those...

18:50.007 --> 18:51.525
little yellow flowers in it.

18:51.527 --> 18:53.594
Mm, white flowers.

18:53.958 --> 18:55.863
I remember our first dance.

18:55.989 --> 18:57.558
"Faithfully" by Journey.

18:57.583 --> 18:59.634
"Witchcraft," Sinatra.

19:00.103 --> 19:01.753
I remember the way you smiled at me

19:01.778 --> 19:03.890
when your cousin dropped the rings.

19:03.915 --> 19:05.948
That was a movie.

19:07.434 --> 19:09.210
We got married, right?

19:11.930 --> 19:14.448
It's okay, you don't
have to remember, I do.

19:14.693 --> 19:15.950
Yes, yes, you do.

19:15.952 --> 19:17.652
You remember everything.

19:18.070 --> 19:18.992
That's why you don't

19:19.017 --> 19:20.121
need the dress

19:20.123 --> 19:22.323
or any of that other stuff.

19:22.885 --> 19:24.583
Your brain is like

19:24.608 --> 19:26.958
our garage full of boxes.

19:30.090 --> 19:32.266
All right? Come on, that's...

19:32.541 --> 19:35.909
that is pretty romantic, right?

19:37.270 --> 19:39.707
It is when you say it, for some reason.

19:40.443 --> 19:41.902
Oh, and here's another thing

19:41.927 --> 19:44.994
I know for sure happened
on our wedding day.

19:45.397 --> 19:47.488
You looked beautiful

19:47.513 --> 19:48.449
and I...

19:48.451 --> 19:50.718
was the luckiest man in the world.

19:51.335 --> 19:52.653
I did.

19:52.922 --> 19:54.588
And you are.

19:56.392 --> 19:58.132
She knows about the dress!

19:58.157 --> 19:59.890
Run!

20:09.029 --> 20:11.150
Okay, now, remember, lefty loosey,

20:11.175 --> 20:12.671
righty tighty and always

20:12.696 --> 20:14.388
always double-check

20:14.413 --> 20:15.467
Uncle Don's work.

20:16.031 --> 20:17.264
He's right about that.

20:17.266 --> 20:18.365
I've been turning the same bolt

20:18.390 --> 20:20.457
for about five minutes.

20:21.550 --> 20:22.869
What can I do?

20:22.871 --> 20:25.150
Uh, you can find Daddy a rag.

20:25.175 --> 20:26.118
Okay.

20:27.892 --> 20:29.182
This is gonna be a nice bike.

20:29.207 --> 20:30.225
Yeah, yeah.

20:30.250 --> 20:31.238
Now, guys that ride these

20:31.263 --> 20:32.689
are usually super cool

20:32.714 --> 20:34.182
and good-looking...

20:34.207 --> 20:36.374
and you're absolutely
forbidden to date them.

20:36.896 --> 20:39.219
Eh, I would never date
a guy with a motorcycle.

20:39.470 --> 20:41.259
- But I do kind of like this one guy. 
- Mm-hmm?

20:41.284 --> 20:42.583
He's the smartest kid in our class.

20:42.608 --> 20:44.318
Ha-ha, nerd.

20:45.716 --> 20:47.927
Keep turning your bolt there, Don.

20:48.078 --> 20:49.752
Oh, thanks, honey.

20:49.860 --> 20:51.827
So, tell me more about this boy.

20:51.852 --> 20:53.851
Oh, well, he's really cool.

20:53.876 --> 20:54.897
- Yeah, he...
- He's really ni...

20:57.117 --> 20:59.906
This is Mommy's wedding dress.

21:00.213 --> 21:01.526
Where did you find this?

21:01.551 --> 21:03.751
In that box that says corks.

21:05.782 --> 21:10.782
