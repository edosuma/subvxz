00:22.200 --> 00:23.793
Oh, my God.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.354
Don't do that.

00:25.520 --> 00:26.749
What?

00:26.960 --> 00:28.440
This?

00:29.120 --> 00:32.033
No, that's... That's... That's fine.

00:32.200 --> 00:33.793
Wait, how'd you get in?

00:33.960 --> 00:36.031
You left the front door unlocked, silly.

00:36.200 --> 00:37.236
I did?

00:37.400 --> 00:39.119
I swear, I locked it.

00:39.280 --> 00:41.670
- Wait, I know I locked it.
- Really?

00:41.840 --> 00:46.312
- You're... You're so paranoid.
- Hold on. Just... I'll be right back.

01:13.520 --> 01:15.432
Aram?

01:19.240 --> 01:21.072
Aram?

01:25.320 --> 01:26.800
Aram, you okay?

01:30.040 --> 01:31.235
Oh, my God.

01:33.080 --> 01:34.878
Be still.

01:36.360 --> 01:37.714
Don't make a sound.

01:49.600 --> 01:51.592
What happened? Where's Aram?

01:51.760 --> 01:54.673
We're still piecing it together.
We got a 911 call.

01:54.880 --> 01:57.031
Neighbors reported
a pounding on the walls.

01:57.200 --> 01:58.839
- Pounding?
- We found her bound...

01:59.000 --> 02:00.673
...and gagged in the closet.

02:00.840 --> 02:02.354
Found who?

02:07.960 --> 02:09.235
What have you done with him?

02:09.440 --> 02:10.999
- Is she nuts?
- Easy.

02:11.160 --> 02:13.595
She's not a suspect here,
she's a victim.

02:13.760 --> 02:16.480
One of the victims.
They were together.

02:17.120 --> 02:18.190
Here.

02:19.840 --> 02:22.480
Tell me everything you dug up
on Dembe since he vanished.

02:22.640 --> 02:25.792
- Why? What's happened?
- His movements, actions, intent.

02:25.960 --> 02:27.952
You've been hunting Dembe
for over a month.

02:28.120 --> 02:31.670
I wanna know everything you've found
because now Agent Mojtabai's in danger.

02:31.880 --> 02:34.031
From what I can tell,
you're no closer to finding Dembe.

02:34.200 --> 02:37.750
- Aram?
- He was abducted by Dembe last night.

02:39.040 --> 02:42.078
- Can you describe what happened?
- Not really, I was in the shower.

02:42.240 --> 02:45.039
You were in the shower
when Dembe came to the apartment?

02:45.200 --> 02:46.350
Think so.

02:46.560 --> 02:48.677
- Where was Aram?
- In the shower with me.

02:49.240 --> 02:51.311
Thought he had left
the front door unlocked.

02:51.520 --> 02:53.557
He went to check
and that's when it happened.

02:53.720 --> 02:57.953
Dembe has taken a calculated risk
abducting Agent Mojtabai.

02:58.120 --> 03:00.316
He wouldn't have done that to harm him...

03:00.480 --> 03:01.630
...but to use him.

03:01.800 --> 03:04.634
For the time being, Aram is perfectly safe.

03:04.800 --> 03:08.476
You'll forgive me if I don't take comfort
in any of your assurances about Dembe.

03:08.640 --> 03:11.075
A man you've so profoundly misjudged.

03:11.240 --> 03:13.232
Are you closer to finding him or not?

03:13.400 --> 03:15.119
I am now.

03:15.280 --> 03:17.954
Aram's abduction presents...

03:18.120 --> 03:19.395
...a rare opportunity.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.354
How so?

03:21.800 --> 03:26.238
Few can truly comprehend
the fierce tenacity...

03:26.400 --> 03:28.710
...of a man like Dembe Zuma.

03:28.880 --> 03:31.111
<i>I taught Dembe everything I knew...</i>

03:31.280 --> 03:34.273
<i>...regarding the tactics
of evasion and survival.</i>

03:34.480 --> 03:36.358
<i>And now, despite dedicating...</i>

03:36.520 --> 03:39.752
<i>...every resource
at my disposal to finding him...</i>

03:39.920 --> 03:42.640
...he has completely eluded detection.

03:42.800 --> 03:45.395
Dembe's timing is impeccable.

03:45.560 --> 03:47.199
<i>And his most deadly attribute...</i>

03:47.640 --> 03:48.676
<i>...his patience.</i>

03:48.840 --> 03:53.119
<i>Which is why
Aram's abduction presents two trails.</i>

03:53.280 --> 03:56.159
And clearly,
two very motivated parties to follow them.

03:56.320 --> 03:58.073
<i>You focus on locating Aram...</i>

03:58.240 --> 04:00.311
<i>...and leave me free to find Dembe.</i>

04:00.480 --> 04:03.154
<i>With any luck,
we'll meet where the paths converge.</i>

04:03.320 --> 04:06.677
No chance. I've let you play it your way,
and Aram paid the price.

04:07.160 --> 04:10.039
Agent Keen goes with you,
and she reports to me.

04:13.520 --> 04:15.432
It's a key hunter.

04:15.600 --> 04:16.636
Aram has one like it.

04:16.800 --> 04:19.440
- What's it do?
- Attach it to things you don't wanna lose.

04:19.600 --> 04:22.160
You know, car keys, laptops, pets.

04:22.360 --> 04:25.319
- GPS?
- It uses cell phones as a location array.

04:25.480 --> 04:28.552
Once you activate it,
it transmits a signal that is relayed...

04:28.720 --> 04:30.632
...by any live cellular device
in its proximity.

04:30.800 --> 04:32.519
Aram's keys weren't at his apartment.

04:32.680 --> 04:34.672
Which means
he probably has them with him.

04:34.840 --> 04:36.991
And if he does, we've got a shot.

04:37.160 --> 04:39.629
I can activate that
using Aram's workstation here.

04:41.400 --> 04:42.595
<i>Where are we going?</i>

04:42.800 --> 04:44.871
To find the Sanctum Corporation.

04:45.040 --> 04:48.829
A refuge,
an enterprise that specializes in...

04:49.000 --> 04:52.118
...relocating criminals
who are on the verge of being arrested...

04:52.280 --> 04:55.079
...or being dispatched by an adversary.

04:55.240 --> 04:57.596
An underground railroad for miscreants.

04:57.760 --> 04:59.717
Do you think
that's how Dembe disappeared?

04:59.880 --> 05:01.678
He hired them?

05:01.840 --> 05:03.069
Not for himself.

05:03.280 --> 05:07.274
Last year, Matias Solomon used
Dembe's family as leverage against him...

05:07.440 --> 05:08.635
...to get to me.

05:08.800 --> 05:12.157
Afterward, I told him to hide
his daughter and granddaughter.

05:12.320 --> 05:13.470
Why couldn't you hide them?

05:13.640 --> 05:16.155
I wanted Dembe to pick
a vendor I knew nothing about.

05:16.320 --> 05:19.358
To keep his family
as far from my world as possible.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.477
He did as I instructed.
So well, in fact...

05:21.640 --> 05:24.599
...I haven't been able to identify
the vendor he contracted.

05:24.800 --> 05:26.951
Sanctum is the last on my list.

05:27.120 --> 05:29.191
Where is this Sanctum Corporation?

05:30.840 --> 05:32.240
I have no idea.

05:33.160 --> 05:35.231
But I've tracked down someone
who's used them.

05:35.400 --> 05:36.834
Richard Fickman...

05:37.000 --> 05:39.469
...a fence known
for moving uncut diamonds...

05:39.640 --> 05:44.396
<i>...disappeared after botching a shipment
for a yakuza oyabun.</i>

05:44.560 --> 05:46.392
<i>We share a podiatrist.</i>

05:46.560 --> 05:51.919
<i>Chatty fellow. Apparently, Sanctum set
him up selling discount men's suits.</i>

06:03.960 --> 06:07.158
Looks like whoever he was hiding from
finally caught up with him.

06:07.320 --> 06:09.551
I don't believe in coincidence.

06:10.080 --> 06:12.117
Someone wants to obstruct my path.

06:18.160 --> 06:19.480
Baz, phone.

06:28.040 --> 06:29.394
Glen.

06:29.560 --> 06:31.552
I need an appointment.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.275
Today.

06:52.440 --> 06:54.511
Fickman's dead. It's done.

06:54.720 --> 06:56.552
<i>Then we're done.</i>

07:49.760 --> 07:53.436
- Dembe, please. Please don't...
- Move.

08:05.800 --> 08:08.474
Okay. What is this?

08:14.720 --> 08:18.999
Raymond's. He has lockers like this
all around the globe.

08:22.840 --> 08:26.436
You want me to hack it
so you can steal from Mr. Reddington.

08:27.240 --> 08:28.799
No.

08:32.360 --> 08:33.679
I'm not gonna do that.

08:46.680 --> 08:50.071
I did not bring you here
to steal from Raymond.

08:50.240 --> 08:53.438
I brought you here to find out
who already did.

08:54.440 --> 08:56.477
You're trying to help him?

08:57.200 --> 08:59.192
Then why not just tell him?

08:59.360 --> 09:01.397
He... He thinks you poisoned him.

09:01.600 --> 09:02.875
Yes.

09:03.040 --> 09:06.716
I handed him the drink that
nearly killed him, but I did not poison it.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.109
So tell him.

09:08.280 --> 09:10.317
Not without proof.

09:12.760 --> 09:14.114
That's why you're here.

09:14.320 --> 09:17.791
You think whoever accessed this locker
is the person who tried to kill him?

09:17.960 --> 09:19.599
Yes.

09:20.760 --> 09:22.831
Okay, fine.

09:24.200 --> 09:26.760
Okay... Okay, these scanners
usually use a syslogd.

09:26.960 --> 09:30.078
That's a program
that stores a list of previous users.

09:30.240 --> 09:32.709
I'll try to access that log...

09:32.920 --> 09:34.513
...but I really don't think...

09:34.960 --> 09:38.556
...we should be doing this
behind Mr. Reddington's back.

09:40.200 --> 09:43.637
Do you really need to still point
that at me? I'm... I'm gonna help.

09:46.360 --> 09:49.592
- Absolutely not.
- We collared her for hacking our system.

09:49.760 --> 09:52.355
- You wanna let her do it again?
- She won't hack our system.

09:52.520 --> 09:55.718
She wants to hack Aram's password
to activate the key hunter.

09:55.880 --> 09:59.032
I can't believe I'm the one saying this,
but she is on our side.

09:59.240 --> 10:02.870
And right now, she is the only chance
we have at finding him.

10:07.520 --> 10:11.036
Agent Navabi. Sit on her
and don't blink. You understand?

10:13.720 --> 10:17.316
Come on, Aram.
Password only has 44 bits of entropy.

10:17.480 --> 10:18.709
Too easy.

10:20.080 --> 10:22.231
- Got it.
- You found him?

10:22.400 --> 10:24.596
Not until someone
with a live cell or tablet...

10:24.760 --> 10:27.070
...happens to come into range
of the key hunter.

10:27.240 --> 10:29.675
- What can we do in the meantime?
- We could be mature.

10:30.240 --> 10:33.677
And talk about the fact
that we're both into the same guy.

10:34.880 --> 10:38.715
Or, you know,
we could just stew in silence about it.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.435
So Dembe finally went off
the deep end, huh?

10:44.600 --> 10:47.035
Can't say I'm surprised,
what with the whole package.

10:47.200 --> 10:49.874
You know, strong, silent type,
all stoic with the eyes...

10:50.080 --> 10:52.436
...and the phony African accent.

10:52.920 --> 10:54.354
I, for one, never bought it.

10:54.520 --> 10:55.715
Good riddance, you ask me.

10:55.920 --> 10:57.991
Besides,
I didn't wanna say anything before...

10:58.160 --> 11:02.120
...but a big, black fellow
waiting on you hand and foot?

11:02.280 --> 11:06.069
Very Edgar Rice Burroughs.

11:08.080 --> 11:10.037
I'm in no mood, Glen.

11:10.200 --> 11:12.635
Did you access the footage I asked for?

11:12.800 --> 11:16.237
Yeah, I rolled back
the DOT camera you called about.

11:16.440 --> 11:19.114
Those cameras are live feeds,
you can't rewind them.

11:19.320 --> 11:20.993
Maybe you can't rewind them, toots...

11:21.200 --> 11:24.557
...but I've got a team of Hindus running
a server farm in Adams Morgan...

11:24.720 --> 11:28.396
...recording every second
of every traffic cam in this burg.

11:28.560 --> 11:31.473
You'd be surprised
how often that comes in handy.

11:31.640 --> 11:35.190
Only one other car was at that warehouse
before you guys showed up.

11:35.360 --> 11:37.636
Registered to Chuck Shaw.

11:37.840 --> 11:40.116
Info's all there.

11:53.640 --> 11:55.996
Good afternoon, Chuck.

11:57.320 --> 11:59.277
Who the hell are you?

11:59.440 --> 12:02.558
Someone with a schedule
that leaves demonstrably less time...

12:02.720 --> 12:04.996
...to hit the gym than you.
Let's see if it's been worth it.

12:05.200 --> 12:06.236
What do you want?

12:06.400 --> 12:07.629
Richard Fickman.

12:07.800 --> 12:09.519
- He's dead.
- That's unfortunate.

12:09.680 --> 12:10.716
Who put you up to it?

12:15.000 --> 12:16.400
It wasn't my idea.

12:16.560 --> 12:18.233
Was it the Sanctum Corporation?

12:18.400 --> 12:20.631
- What is Sanctum?
- How did you find him?

12:22.000 --> 12:24.879
Over there. The folder.

12:26.720 --> 12:30.430
It's a full dossier on Fickman.
His movements, past addresses.

12:30.960 --> 12:32.679
Who hired you to kill him?

12:36.280 --> 12:37.760
We made a deal.

12:37.920 --> 12:39.354
- Who?
- Doctor...

12:39.520 --> 12:40.874
...Sofia Gallup.

12:48.120 --> 12:49.270
Please, go on.

12:50.960 --> 12:52.189
I was locked up.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.593
She was my therapist.

12:54.760 --> 12:56.080
She got me paroled.

12:56.240 --> 12:59.233
Dr. Gallup said all I had to do
was kill a guy she wanted dead.

12:59.400 --> 13:02.313
She gave me that folder
when I was leaving Otisville.

13:02.480 --> 13:06.554
She must've given you a way
to contact her to confirm the job was done.

13:06.760 --> 13:09.400
A burner. I destroyed it.

13:10.280 --> 13:12.920
- We're done here.
- Wait a minute, he's a murderer.

13:13.080 --> 13:14.912
We don't have time for this. Baz.

13:20.160 --> 13:23.597
Yeah, this is Agent Elizabeth Keen.
I got a case for D.C.P.D.

13:23.760 --> 13:25.114
I'm gonna give you an address.

13:25.560 --> 13:27.358
I did it, okay?

13:27.520 --> 13:29.557
Here's the data you wanted, but...

13:29.720 --> 13:32.030
- Who was it?
- I don't know.

13:32.200 --> 13:34.157
This scanner uses proprietary encryption.

13:34.320 --> 13:36.118
It would take me days to crack this...

13:36.280 --> 13:39.273
...and figure out who accessed the...
This locker.

13:39.440 --> 13:41.432
I'm so sorry.

13:47.440 --> 13:49.238
You can go.

13:49.960 --> 13:51.792
I can go? Just like that?

13:54.240 --> 13:55.640
Please forgive me.

14:13.160 --> 14:14.389
Well...

14:14.560 --> 14:17.997
...there might be one way
to get past the proprietary encryption.

14:20.280 --> 14:22.431
Are you really trying
to help Mr. Reddington?

14:24.280 --> 14:27.318
I have three people in my life...

14:27.480 --> 14:32.271
...my daughter,
my granddaughter and Raymond.

14:34.960 --> 14:36.997
I have an idea.

14:41.920 --> 14:42.990
Thank you.

14:43.160 --> 14:46.312
Bureau of Prisons confirmed
Dr. Sofia Gallup consults for them.

14:46.480 --> 14:48.392
She covers the entire northeast.

14:48.560 --> 14:52.520
No home office is listed, and her
license is registered at a P.O. Box.

14:52.680 --> 14:55.354
How about the last parolee
for whom the doctor testified?

14:55.520 --> 14:58.433
A felon named Dennis Cauley.

15:00.600 --> 15:01.750
And he was released?

15:01.960 --> 15:04.270
To an address in Richmond.

15:24.480 --> 15:27.439
This looks like a dossier
on Dr. Gallup's next victim.

15:27.600 --> 15:29.592
Alex Sato.

15:31.040 --> 15:32.713
Except his name isn't Alex Sato.

15:32.880 --> 15:37.159
It's Daniel Nakamoto,
master forger of antiquities.

15:37.320 --> 15:41.075
Thirteen years ago,
he was paid a pile of money...

15:41.240 --> 15:44.711
...for a cuneiform tablet by the boss
of the Sacriponti crime family.

15:44.920 --> 15:47.913
Daniel claimed the tablet was part
of the Sippar Library.

15:48.080 --> 15:52.199
What Daniel didn't know, and what
Mr. Sacriponti was rather upset to learn...

15:52.360 --> 15:54.238
...was that two weeks earlier...

15:54.400 --> 15:57.916
...looters had broken
into Iraq's Museum of Antiquities...

15:58.080 --> 16:00.595
...and destroyed the entire collection.

16:00.760 --> 16:03.036
Daniel Nakamoto disappeared
shortly after.

16:03.200 --> 16:06.113
So the Sanctum Corporation
helped him vanish.

16:06.560 --> 16:07.914
And now they want him dead.

16:08.080 --> 16:10.037
- Why?
- I don't know.

16:10.200 --> 16:13.557
But if Sanctum helped him disappear,
only they can make him reappear.

16:13.720 --> 16:15.234
Dr. Gallup?
How is she connected?

16:15.720 --> 16:17.234
<i>I have no idea.</i>

16:17.400 --> 16:20.598
<i>But she certainly understands
the dynamics of leverage.</i>

16:21.240 --> 16:24.517
<i>She gives these prisoners freedom
in exchange for murder.</i>

16:24.680 --> 16:27.878
<i>I'm sure many of them would feel
it's a small price to pay.</i>

16:28.240 --> 16:31.472
<i>This guy's been tracking Nakamoto,
tracing his movements.</i>

16:31.640 --> 16:32.710
Circling his prey.

16:32.880 --> 16:37.318
Looks like Nakamoto is
at the Gabor Museum every afternoon.

16:47.080 --> 16:48.355
Afternoon, Daniel.

16:50.800 --> 16:54.350
I think you've mistaken me
for someone else.

16:54.520 --> 16:56.352
Oh, I assure you I have not.

16:56.520 --> 17:00.309
In fact, I'm something of a fan
of your work.

17:00.480 --> 17:04.633
I saw a Xuande Ming urn
you fabricated...

17:04.800 --> 17:08.156
...fetch quite a price
at the King family's final auction.

17:08.319 --> 17:11.118
It was near perfect.

17:11.880 --> 17:13.439
Raymond Reddington?

17:13.599 --> 17:17.833
Now that we're speaking plainly,
I'm afraid your cover has been blown.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.834
I suppose
that's fairly obvious at this point...

17:21.000 --> 17:22.992
...but nonetheless, I'm here to tell you...

17:23.680 --> 17:27.037
...that an assassin is coming to kill you.

17:28.160 --> 17:29.276
No sign of Cauley.

17:29.960 --> 17:33.158
- Why would he pick a crowded place?
- It's like a prison yard.

17:33.360 --> 17:35.750
The Sanctum Corporation
has given you up.

17:35.920 --> 17:37.957
But I'm willing to help you vanish again...

17:38.160 --> 17:40.550
- ...in exchange for...
- You're lying.

17:40.720 --> 17:44.475
There's no way
Sanctum could betray me.

17:44.640 --> 17:46.040
Impossible.

17:50.600 --> 17:53.672
Baz, I've got eyes on him.
Bald, brown leather jacket.

17:54.360 --> 17:56.397
Baz, tell me you see him.
He's getting close.

17:59.120 --> 18:00.998
I'm warning you, Daniel.

18:01.160 --> 18:04.312
- Your life is in grave danger.
- If you're right...

18:04.520 --> 18:06.591
...and the Sanctum Corporation
has failed me...

18:06.760 --> 18:08.752
...then no one can keep me safe.

18:09.280 --> 18:10.555
Not even you.

18:15.640 --> 18:16.835
Drop it!

18:18.280 --> 18:19.396
FBI!

18:23.280 --> 18:25.033
Hands on your head.

18:27.720 --> 18:29.040
<i>What do you wanna know?</i>

18:29.200 --> 18:31.590
Everything you can tell me
about the Sanctum Corporation.

18:32.440 --> 18:35.160
It was run by Tony and Maria Lopez.

18:35.320 --> 18:38.791
They owned a honey company in Ohio.

18:38.960 --> 18:41.953
They used bee colonies
around the world...

18:42.120 --> 18:43.873
...as safe houses and way stations.

18:44.040 --> 18:48.671
But when I said it wasn't possible
for them to give me up, I meant it.

18:48.840 --> 18:52.197
The Lopezes died months ago.

18:54.200 --> 18:55.873
Thank you, Daniel.

18:56.040 --> 19:00.398
I suggest you return home
and pack your things. I'll be in touch.

19:07.320 --> 19:08.549
Glen.

19:08.720 --> 19:11.076
I need information on a deceased couple.

19:11.240 --> 19:14.199
Tony and Maria Lopez of Ohio.

19:14.360 --> 19:15.874
They were apiarists.

19:16.040 --> 19:18.271
<i>- What? "Ape fairies"?
- Apiarists.</i>

19:18.440 --> 19:20.397
Bees.

19:20.560 --> 19:23.075
When I first met Aram,
oh, he was so uptight.

19:23.240 --> 19:27.553
I mean, with the strict Muslim upbringing
with a healthy dose of Jewish guilt.

19:27.720 --> 19:30.838
He hadn't had a sip of alcohol
until he was postgrad at MIT.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.912
He really needed to cut loose.

19:33.560 --> 19:35.438
And you helped him.

19:35.600 --> 19:40.072
You say that like I'm some
sort of enabler or something.

19:40.480 --> 19:42.949
Yeah, okay, fine.
I enable him to have fun.

19:43.160 --> 19:45.152
I enable him to blow off steam.

19:45.320 --> 19:46.800
I enable him to laugh.

19:46.960 --> 19:48.553
Do you have a problem with that?

19:48.720 --> 19:51.997
I do if it interferes
with the work that he does here.

19:52.440 --> 19:53.669
Right.

19:55.760 --> 19:57.160
What is that supposed to mean?

19:57.320 --> 19:59.277
You know exactly what
that's supposed to mean.

19:59.440 --> 20:00.760
You're upset...

20:00.920 --> 20:03.116
...because I know Aram...

20:03.280 --> 20:04.714
...and you don't.

20:09.200 --> 20:10.236
Got him.

20:10.400 --> 20:12.676
RBM Digital Security bureau data site.

20:12.840 --> 20:15.400
Agents Mojtabai and Zuma. FBI.

20:15.560 --> 20:18.712
We got a warrant to run a device
through your proprietary decryption.

20:18.880 --> 20:21.634
We don't allow access to this facility
for outside requests.

20:21.800 --> 20:25.350
Yeah, we're on a time crunch.
It's a matter of national security.

20:26.040 --> 20:27.235
The warrant?

20:27.400 --> 20:28.914
Zuma, give the man the warrant.

20:33.680 --> 20:35.876
Don't tell me
you didn't grab it off the desk.

20:36.040 --> 20:37.633
Oh, Zuma. You're killing me.

20:37.840 --> 20:39.115
- I am sorry.
- You're sorry?

20:39.280 --> 20:41.112
He's sorry. Sorry, "sir."

20:41.280 --> 20:43.112
- Sorry, sir.
- That's right.

20:43.280 --> 20:44.475
That's right, okay.

20:44.680 --> 20:46.194
Can we sit and call this in?

20:46.360 --> 20:49.034
Court should be able
to messenger a new one ASAP.

20:58.400 --> 21:00.960
Oh, this is... This is great.

21:01.120 --> 21:03.635
An agent will have a warrant here in...
In no time.

21:04.320 --> 21:06.232
Thank you. Thank you so much.

21:06.400 --> 21:09.393
All right, okay.
That bought us maybe like 15 minutes.

21:09.560 --> 21:13.554
If I'm lucky,
I can find the encryption key...

21:14.200 --> 21:16.396
...before he gets back.

21:16.560 --> 21:17.789
Thank you, Aram.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.071
Well, it's for Mr. Reddington.

21:21.680 --> 21:23.114
Right?

21:24.800 --> 21:27.315
Right, okay. All right, here we go.

21:35.600 --> 21:37.000
You gotta be kidding me.

21:37.160 --> 21:40.437
You're the one
in such a damn rush. Get in.

21:47.280 --> 21:50.398
This lacks even a modicum of discretion.

21:51.320 --> 21:54.438
We can speak freely. SeÃ±ora Vazquez
doesn't know a lick of English.

21:54.600 --> 21:56.751
Turn right at the light up ahead.

21:56.960 --> 21:58.280
What did you find?

21:58.440 --> 22:00.671
The Lopezes ran Sanctum for decades.

22:00.880 --> 22:03.031
Nine months ago,
they got burnt to a crisp.

22:03.400 --> 22:07.076
Fire started in the middle of the night.
Police report says arson. No suspects.

22:10.280 --> 22:13.034
It's a car, sweet-cheeks.
Not a rollercoaster.

22:13.440 --> 22:15.272
They had a daughter named Vanessa.

22:15.440 --> 22:16.840
Apple fell far from the tree.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.832
She was on the up and up. A therapist.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.798
A therapist? Like Dr. Gallup.

22:20.960 --> 22:22.917
Gallup and Lopez could be one
and the same.

22:23.080 --> 22:25.800
I don't know no Gallup,
Vanessa was there during the fire.

22:25.960 --> 22:27.917
Got burnt pretty bad but survived.

22:28.080 --> 22:31.357
Says here all the Lopez family bee farms
were foreclosed by the bank.

22:31.520 --> 22:33.193
All but the one that burned down.

22:33.360 --> 22:35.113
It's still owned by Vanessa Lopez.

22:35.440 --> 22:36.920
Then that's where we're headed.

22:37.120 --> 22:41.319
Please, stop at the corner.

22:46.560 --> 22:50.110
Good luck on your exam.

22:54.440 --> 22:56.318
Okay, about 10 seconds.

22:56.520 --> 22:57.874
Samar and Ressler are here.

22:58.040 --> 23:01.078
- Hurry.
- Come on. Downloading.

23:01.240 --> 23:02.435
All right, here we are.

23:03.360 --> 23:04.714
Kathryn Nemec.

23:06.880 --> 23:09.440
Who is...? Who is Kathryn Nemec?

23:09.800 --> 23:11.871
What? Is this bad? This seems bad.

23:12.960 --> 23:14.792
I cannot go back yet.

23:15.320 --> 23:16.595
I need proof.

23:17.080 --> 23:18.673
There's one last thing I must do.

23:19.680 --> 23:21.592
Okay, go. You better go.

23:21.760 --> 23:24.639
Do what you gotta do
to help Mr. Reddington, but do it fast.

23:26.600 --> 23:29.035
Locking down.

23:30.200 --> 23:32.032
Aram, open the door.

23:32.200 --> 23:34.635
- Sorry, I can't.
- Can't or won't?

23:44.120 --> 23:45.349
Dembe, stop!

23:53.920 --> 23:56.640
Okay, gotta open that door. Yes, okay.

24:02.480 --> 24:03.800
Closing now.

24:05.640 --> 24:07.518
Dembe, don't make me shoot you!

24:07.680 --> 24:09.114
I didn't do anything.

24:09.280 --> 24:10.475
Then come in. Prove it!

24:10.640 --> 24:13.235
That's my plan. But I need the proof.

24:14.160 --> 24:15.879
Dembe.

24:16.360 --> 24:18.033
No, no, Ressler, no.

24:46.560 --> 24:48.597
Fascinating.

24:50.880 --> 24:52.951
I hope you don't mind me diving right in.

24:53.120 --> 24:56.909
I've been looking for you for quite a while
and time is of the essence.

25:02.640 --> 25:03.960
What were you thinking?

25:04.120 --> 25:06.715
- He needed my help.
- You didn't have to help him escape.

25:06.880 --> 25:09.600
- We all could've helped.
- We're on the Reddington task force...

25:09.760 --> 25:12.275
...and the one person
Dembe can't get near right now...

25:12.440 --> 25:14.909
- ...is Mr. Reddington.
- I don't think he'd hurt Dembe.

25:15.080 --> 25:17.470
He might if he felt Dembe betrayed him.
He didn't...

25:17.640 --> 25:19.836
...but everything points
towards that, so...

25:20.000 --> 25:21.559
No telling what Reddington might do.

25:21.720 --> 25:24.599
- You find anything to exonerate Dembe?
- Honestly, I don't know.

25:24.760 --> 25:26.638
We found a name: Kathryn Nemec.

25:26.800 --> 25:29.156
Run her down
and find out what you can.

25:29.320 --> 25:31.357
And, Aram,
you better be right about Dembe...

25:31.520 --> 25:33.876
...because whatever happens next
is on you.

25:41.360 --> 25:43.431
Hey. Are you okay? Are you hurt?

25:43.640 --> 25:45.154
No, you?

25:45.320 --> 25:46.879
No.

25:53.840 --> 25:55.877
I can't leave right now.
Can we talk later?

25:56.040 --> 25:57.110
Of course.

25:57.320 --> 25:58.959
Come on, I'll walk you out.

26:03.800 --> 26:04.836
It's hypnotic.

26:05.040 --> 26:08.829
It was only a matter of time before
one of you figured it out and showed up.

26:09.040 --> 26:12.477
- You knew I'd get to you eventually.
- I'm not one of your parents' clients.

26:12.640 --> 26:14.916
But we know what you're doing to them.

26:15.080 --> 26:17.356
Richard Fickman, Daniel Nakamoto.

26:17.760 --> 26:21.037
We know you made deals with some
of your prison therapy patients.

26:21.200 --> 26:23.396
We just don't know why.

26:24.680 --> 26:26.319
When I was a child...

26:26.520 --> 26:29.957
...this place was the backbone
of our honey business.

26:30.680 --> 26:34.390
My father knew a guy
that needed a hideout and he helped.

26:34.560 --> 26:35.994
And then another one showed up.

26:36.560 --> 26:37.596
And another one.

26:37.760 --> 26:40.594
Soon my parents made more
from their Sanctum Corporation...

26:40.760 --> 26:42.638
...than they were from the bees.

26:43.240 --> 26:45.709
The fortune my parents made
hiding criminals...

26:45.880 --> 26:48.076
...was in a Vulcan safe
in our basement.

26:48.240 --> 26:50.960
The only people who knew that
were the criminals passing through.

26:51.120 --> 26:53.999
Someone came back
and tried to steal the money.

26:54.160 --> 26:56.550
But while cutting through the lock
with an acetylene torch...

26:56.760 --> 26:58.558
...they set the house on fire.

26:59.360 --> 27:01.716
I was the only one that survived.

27:19.040 --> 27:22.556
Apitherapy's the only thing I found
effective in fighting the infection.

27:22.720 --> 27:24.712
Pheromones from the queen
attract the swarm.

27:24.880 --> 27:27.270
And their stings and enzymes...

27:27.440 --> 27:29.272
...heal the scars.

27:29.440 --> 27:32.512
You have no idea which client did this,
so you're killing them all.

27:32.680 --> 27:36.913
If their file is in my parents' ledger,
they deserve punishment for something.

27:37.080 --> 27:39.436
There's an entry in that ledger
I need to see.

27:40.400 --> 27:43.837
For your sake,
I hope it's not crossed off.

27:57.920 --> 28:00.480
- Kathryn Nemec is missing?
- She disappeared in 1991.

28:00.640 --> 28:02.313
Just dropped off the grid.

28:02.480 --> 28:04.790
Lived at a few addresses
in the Midwest in her 30s.

28:04.960 --> 28:07.634
Worked at an exclusive
domestic staffing agency...

28:07.800 --> 28:09.837
...but then one day, she's just gone.

28:10.040 --> 28:11.394
And there is no more record.

28:11.560 --> 28:14.439
You say this Nemec, she's the one
who's attacking Reddington?

28:14.600 --> 28:17.354
- Dembe seemed to think so.
- She's been missing for 25 years.

28:17.520 --> 28:22.117
I cannot explain it, but had you seen
Dembe's face when he saw her name...

28:23.320 --> 28:24.800
It was like he'd seen a ghost.

28:26.200 --> 28:29.637
Cooper's sending a team
to pick up Dr. Gallup.

28:30.640 --> 28:32.120
He says Aram is safe.

28:32.600 --> 28:35.798
Aram insists Dembe is innocent.

28:37.120 --> 28:39.112
I need to be the judge of that.

28:39.320 --> 28:40.834
He's not the one hurting you.

28:41.280 --> 28:43.112
He was using Aram to find that person.

28:43.320 --> 28:46.552
People run when they are scared
and when they're guilty.

28:46.720 --> 28:50.760
<i>You can afford to hope for the best,
but to survive in my world...</i>

28:50.920 --> 28:52.320
<i>...I assume the worst.</i>

28:53.680 --> 28:54.830
<i>Mr. Reddington.</i>

28:55.440 --> 28:57.238
How did you find me?

28:57.400 --> 28:59.232
Hello, Isabella.

28:59.600 --> 29:01.796
I'm sorry, please come in.

29:07.400 --> 29:09.312
Please, sit.

29:12.680 --> 29:13.796
Mommy?

29:21.400 --> 29:23.551
I need to speak with your father, Isabella.

29:24.120 --> 29:26.919
Speak with him? What do you mean?
Where is he?

29:28.200 --> 29:30.396
<i>- I don't know.
- Is he safe?</i>

29:32.880 --> 29:34.200
We don't know.

29:34.640 --> 29:36.074
But something's happened.

29:36.240 --> 29:38.038
I hope not...

29:38.600 --> 29:40.193
...but I won't know until I find him.

29:41.920 --> 29:43.513
<i>Does he want you to find him?</i>

29:45.240 --> 29:46.469
He does not.

29:46.680 --> 29:48.353
But I have to.

29:48.520 --> 29:50.910
And I must insist on your help to do so.

29:58.760 --> 30:01.400
Sometimes he sends me packages.

30:01.560 --> 30:03.631
Prepaid cell phones
with one number saved.

30:04.160 --> 30:05.719
For emergencies.

30:09.600 --> 30:12.877
When my father told me
he moved us here to protect us...

30:13.320 --> 30:16.040
...I never dreamed he meant
to keep us safe from you.

30:16.520 --> 30:18.352
He didn't.

30:33.080 --> 30:35.834
- Are you okay, Isabella?
- Yes, she's okay.

30:36.840 --> 30:39.878
- What are you doing there, Raymond?
- Trying to find you.

30:40.040 --> 30:41.679
<i>Isabella and Elle.</i>

30:41.840 --> 30:43.115
They're perfectly safe.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.229
<i>What are you doing, Dembe?</i>

30:47.400 --> 30:51.235
Because everything you seem
to be doing is making you look guilty.

30:51.400 --> 30:52.720
<i>We're both guilty, Raymond.</i>

30:52.880 --> 30:55.520
I came here to see for myself.
She's not here.

30:55.680 --> 30:57.558
Who...? Who's not?
What are you saying?

31:00.800 --> 31:01.870
Dembe?

31:04.360 --> 31:05.714
Dembe?

31:06.240 --> 31:07.310
<i>Dembe?</i>

31:39.880 --> 31:41.599
I know who you are.

31:41.760 --> 31:44.229
You and that fella in the hat
brought Kate out here.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.310
Two men against an unarmed woman.

31:48.640 --> 31:50.393
That was cowardly.

31:50.560 --> 31:52.552
And you still couldn't get the job done.

31:53.720 --> 31:55.518
You didn't know she survived, did you?

31:56.640 --> 32:00.077
Old Kate flat out refused to die.

32:01.560 --> 32:04.075
She warned me about you, the muscle.

32:04.640 --> 32:08.111
Said the man in the hat never goes
anywhere without you by his side.

32:08.680 --> 32:10.831
Kate told me you'd be back.

32:11.480 --> 32:13.437
And I've been waiting.

32:13.600 --> 32:16.195
I'm gonna kill you both
for what you did to her.

32:16.840 --> 32:21.153
Now, where is your slick-suited friend?

32:25.360 --> 32:26.396
What?

32:40.040 --> 32:42.635
<i>- Agent Mojtabai.
- What did you and Dembe find, Aram?</i>

32:42.800 --> 32:43.950
Mr. Reddington.

32:44.120 --> 32:46.351
I spoke to him.
He began to tell me something...

32:46.520 --> 32:49.035
- ...but he was attacked.
- Attacked?

32:49.200 --> 32:50.873
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

32:51.040 --> 32:53.475
The person he thinks is coming for me...

32:53.640 --> 32:55.313
...it may be a woman.

32:55.480 --> 32:58.314
<i>- Is Dembe gonna be okay?
- He released you. Why?</i>

32:58.480 --> 33:00.358
Did you discover something?

33:00.520 --> 33:02.193
We found a name: Kathryn Nemec.

33:04.760 --> 33:05.955
Say... Say that again.

33:06.120 --> 33:07.952
Kathryn Nemec.

33:08.120 --> 33:10.715
<i>But she's been missing since 1991.</i>

33:11.880 --> 33:14.395
What? Please, tell me. Is he okay?

33:14.560 --> 33:16.279
Reddington, what's going on?

33:16.720 --> 33:19.030
What's happened to Dembe?

33:23.040 --> 33:24.269
I'll find him.

33:25.760 --> 33:26.876
I'll find him.

33:42.560 --> 33:43.676
It's me.

33:43.840 --> 33:46.230
Hate to leave this on your machine...

33:46.400 --> 33:48.710
...but there's something
you ought to know.

34:07.680 --> 34:13.391
A man's greatest enemy is
the dark forces pent up within himself.

34:14.120 --> 34:16.315
But not for me.

34:16.480 --> 34:19.552
My dark forces had a name.

34:20.400 --> 34:27.112
The person I entrusted
with the most heinous offenses of my life.

34:28.040 --> 34:29.759
Every...

34:29.960 --> 34:32.156
...trespass I committed...

34:32.320 --> 34:34.357
...expunged.

34:35.480 --> 34:38.678
Cleansed as if it had never happened.

34:41.639 --> 34:43.757
My confessor...

34:44.960 --> 34:47.600
...who doth now condemn me.

34:48.600 --> 34:50.751
What are you talking about?

34:52.840 --> 34:54.194
Kathryn Nemec.

34:54.400 --> 34:56.995
And who is Kathryn Nemec?

34:57.160 --> 34:59.914
A name that came to represent
my darkest hours.

35:00.080 --> 35:01.799
My friend.

35:07.160 --> 35:09.277
Mr. Kaplan.

35:10.800 --> 35:13.031
Mr. Kaplan?

35:15.640 --> 35:17.120
She's alive?

35:17.440 --> 35:21.957
When I pulled the trigger, I...
I left without checking.

35:23.400 --> 35:27.360
I would never have been so careless...

35:29.120 --> 35:34.354
...if there wasn't a part of me that wished
I hadn't done what I had just...

35:34.520 --> 35:36.113
...done.

35:36.600 --> 35:38.990
It's been her all along.

35:39.160 --> 35:42.073
Retribution for what I did to her.

35:43.760 --> 35:47.151
Can the score be even now?

35:47.320 --> 35:49.960
Can this be over?

35:52.320 --> 35:55.199
All I know is I need to find Dembe.

36:52.760 --> 36:54.240
Dembe.

36:55.720 --> 36:58.110
She's alive. Kate is alive.

36:58.320 --> 36:59.754
I'm sorry, Dembe.

37:00.640 --> 37:02.552
- Who did this to you?
- A man.

37:02.720 --> 37:06.077
He found Kate.
He's injured in his left knee.

37:09.320 --> 37:11.835
- Where did you last see him?
- West of here.

37:15.240 --> 37:17.994
You need a doctor. Keep that tight.

37:20.080 --> 37:21.196
Okay, here we go.

37:22.120 --> 37:23.952
- You're not going after him.
- I am.

37:24.400 --> 37:25.834
He'll lead me to Kate.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.878
Get Dembe to a hospital, please.

37:47.080 --> 37:50.278
We should double-back,
find another path. This is all too exposed.

38:28.040 --> 38:30.760
You must know my friend Kate.

38:42.160 --> 38:43.833
Should've told you about Janet.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.037
It doesn't matter.

38:46.200 --> 38:49.238
It does to me. Sorry that...

38:50.640 --> 38:52.074
Hey.

38:52.760 --> 38:54.160
Can I say what I admire about you?

38:54.320 --> 38:56.960
- I would rather you didn't.
- Your intensity.

38:57.120 --> 38:58.759
The way you talk and think.

38:58.920 --> 39:00.479
- The way you do the job.
- Stop it.

39:00.640 --> 39:03.633
I don't just admire it,
I'm also terrified by it.

39:05.520 --> 39:08.479
And about what it would do to me
if we got too close.

39:13.160 --> 39:15.470
How's this for terrifying?

39:16.080 --> 39:18.675
I couldn't care less what you admire.

39:46.160 --> 39:48.800
I can appreciate
the kindness you showed...

39:48.960 --> 39:50.758
...to an injured woman in need.

39:50.920 --> 39:52.479
It's commendable.

39:52.640 --> 39:55.553
As is your loyalty to her.

39:56.120 --> 39:59.113
Even under the threat of death.

39:59.920 --> 40:02.151
But you do need to call her.

40:04.360 --> 40:06.397
She was right about you.

40:06.560 --> 40:09.519
Said you were very dangerous...

40:09.680 --> 40:11.433
...and absolutely relentless.

40:12.280 --> 40:14.670
Could've used a few like you
in Quáº£ng Triá»‹.

40:14.840 --> 40:19.198
Back then we used to say: If you're gonna
take a shot at old Victor Charlie...

40:19.360 --> 40:20.555
...you better hit him.

40:20.720 --> 40:21.995
Because if you don't...

40:22.160 --> 40:26.359
...Victor, his brother
and three cousins shoot back.

40:26.520 --> 40:28.591
Kate's also very dangerous.

40:29.120 --> 40:32.511
And absolutely relentless.

40:32.880 --> 40:34.519
Guess she learned that from you.

40:35.400 --> 40:37.119
If I'd been in your shoes...

40:37.280 --> 40:41.069
...I'd made damn sure I didn't miss.

40:42.600 --> 40:46.674
Yes, that was a mistake
I won't make again. Call her.

40:49.200 --> 40:52.477
Seems to me
I'm not gonna survive this either way.

40:52.640 --> 40:55.758
This may seem ironic,
considering the circumstances...

40:55.920 --> 40:58.879
...but I abhor violence.

40:59.040 --> 41:02.795
I only resort to it
at times of extreme necessity.

41:02.960 --> 41:07.751
So believe me when I say,
this is both extreme and necessary.

41:10.080 --> 41:11.514
Call her.

41:17.160 --> 41:19.436
She said you'd do this.

41:19.600 --> 41:21.557
She said I'd do what exactly?

41:22.120 --> 41:24.271
Underestimate her.

41:39.400 --> 41:40.754
Baz.

41:50.000 --> 41:53.072
<i>It's me. Hate to leave this
on your machine...</i>

41:53.760 --> 41:55.717
<i>...but there's something
you ought to know.</i>

41:55.880 --> 41:58.998
<i>Your friends, black fella
and the man in the hat...</i>

41:59.200 --> 42:01.635
<i>...Reddington, they're here.</i>

42:01.800 --> 42:03.792
<i>You said they'd kill me to get to you.</i>

42:04.000 --> 42:06.231
<i>If this is the last time
you hear my voice...</i>

42:06.400 --> 42:08.631
<i>...know that I didn't give you up.</i>

42:08.800 --> 42:10.678
<i>And I didn't go down without a fight.</i>

42:10.880 --> 42:14.237
<i>You told me, if he ever figured
out you're still alive...</i>

42:14.400 --> 42:16.039
<i>...he'd come at you full-bore.</i>

42:16.200 --> 42:18.715
<i>Well, lock and load, Katie.</i>

42:18.880 --> 42:21.918
<i>Your war has come.</i>
