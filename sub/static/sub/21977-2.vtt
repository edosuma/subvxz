Raphael ?

01:21.560 --> 01:22.827
ease off, April.

01:22.895 --> 01:24.063
we had
a rough night.

01:24.130 --> 01:25.965
i'm not doing a thing

01:26.033 --> 01:28.268
till we eat
some serious breakfast.

01:28.337 --> 01:31.007
and we don't eat
until we practice.

01:41.657 --> 01:43.026
Michelangelo,

01:43.094 --> 01:45.062
don't lose
your patience.

01:57.049 --> 02:00.051
i'd say you just got
smoked, Michelangelo.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.089
indeed, Michelangelo
has much

02:02.157 --> 02:04.226
to learn
about patience.

02:04.293 --> 02:05.861
yeah, you got to learn
to keep cool

02:05.929 --> 02:09.866
like the rest of us.

02:09.935 --> 02:11.103
who wants
corn flakes ?

02:11.171 --> 02:12.405
i'm having
raisin bran.

02:12.472 --> 02:14.007
choco puffs
for me.

02:14.074 --> 02:17.513
you wouldn't have any,
uh, real food, would you ?

02:17.580 --> 02:19.315
of course.

02:19.383 --> 02:21.185
sushi ?

02:21.253 --> 02:22.887
i guess i can hold out

02:22.955 --> 02:24.657
until we get
up to the street.

02:24.724 --> 02:27.195
are we going
somewhere ?

02:27.263 --> 02:28.930
don't you remember
that big compound

02:28.998 --> 02:30.667
that was under the ninja's
headquarters ?

02:30.734 --> 02:32.370
that big technodrome
thingamajig.

02:32.437 --> 02:34.206
we've got
to check it out.

02:34.273 --> 02:35.875
it's my only hope
of getting a story

02:35.942 --> 02:37.677
out of all of this
craziness.

02:45.357 --> 02:47.994
funny, we don't
get much rain

02:48.062 --> 02:49.629
here in
the sewers.

02:49.697 --> 02:51.500
it's not rain.

02:51.567 --> 02:53.869
it's water from
last night's flood.

02:53.937 --> 02:56.373
come on, we must be
almost there.

02:56.441 --> 02:59.211
it should be right...
here ?

03:00.548 --> 03:02.650
you know,
a hot dog stand

03:02.717 --> 03:04.453
would clean up
in a place like this.

03:04.521 --> 03:07.290
i don't get it.
it's got to be here.

03:07.359 --> 03:08.992
see ? there's
the foundation

03:09.061 --> 03:10.462
of the building
that flooded.

03:10.530 --> 03:13.733
where could a vast subterranean
compound go down here ?

03:13.801 --> 03:15.136
that-a-way.

03:17.541 --> 03:19.008
what a story !

03:19.077 --> 03:20.678
come on, we've
gotta follow it.

03:20.745 --> 03:23.783
wait. we must tell
master Splinter about this.

03:34.401 --> 03:36.202
i don't believe it.

03:36.271 --> 03:38.640
my mighty
foot soldiers beaten

03:38.707 --> 03:40.376
by a bunch of turtles ?

03:43.248 --> 03:45.551
and mutant turtles
at that.

03:45.618 --> 03:49.290
<i>Saki ?
this is Krang. </i>

03:49.357 --> 03:52.828
<i>report to me
at once. </i>

03:52.896 --> 03:55.666
great ! terrific !
we're on the run,

03:55.734 --> 03:59.005
and that idiot
wants to chitchat.

03:59.073 --> 04:00.841
well, what is it ?

04:00.909 --> 04:05.181
ah, Saki,
my old friend.

04:05.249 --> 04:09.322
i told you,
call me the Shredder.

04:09.389 --> 04:12.827
you wouldn't be
shredding anything

04:12.894 --> 04:15.864
if it weren't
for me.

04:15.932 --> 04:20.005
i have given you vast
technical knowledge--

04:21.240 --> 04:23.176
but you have not
fulfilled

04:23.243 --> 04:25.613
your half
of the bargain.

04:25.681 --> 04:30.354
my legions are waiting
in dimension x

04:30.421 --> 04:34.861
to storm into this world
and crush it.

04:34.928 --> 04:37.799
all i lack is a body,

04:37.867 --> 04:41.372
a body which
you have failed

04:41.439 --> 04:44.442
to provide for me.

04:44.510 --> 04:48.147
non of us is safe
as long as Hamato Yoshi

04:48.216 --> 04:51.086
and his turtles
roam the sewers.

04:51.153 --> 04:55.158
heh. with the body
i designed,

04:55.227 --> 04:59.366
no force on earth
could stop me.

04:59.434 --> 05:01.469
including myself !

05:01.537 --> 05:04.808
that's why i don't
trust you, Krang ?

05:04.876 --> 05:07.445
and if i gave you

05:07.512 --> 05:10.750
a means of defeating
your enemies--

05:12.019 --> 05:14.623
then would you
trust me ?

05:14.690 --> 05:16.259
possibly.

05:16.326 --> 05:17.761
but first tell me

05:17.828 --> 05:20.633
how to defeat
the turtles.

05:20.700 --> 05:22.602
you were the one
who tried

05:22.670 --> 05:26.742
to destroy Yoshi
with that mutagen.

05:26.809 --> 05:28.244
but instead,

05:28.312 --> 05:32.016
he gained the powers
of the rats.

05:32.084 --> 05:35.489
but suppose Yoshi
had been near

05:35.556 --> 05:38.460
a more powerful animal.|

05:38.528 --> 05:40.730
mutate my own people.

05:40.798 --> 05:43.235
the possibilities
are endless.

05:43.303 --> 05:45.338
all i need
are animals.

05:45.406 --> 05:49.077
ha ha ha ha ha !
killers !

05:49.145 --> 05:51.982
that's quite a brain
you've got, Krang.

05:52.050 --> 05:56.121
of course it is.
it's all i've got.

05:57.358 --> 05:59.527
you saw
the ninja's leader

05:59.595 --> 06:02.064
in that underground
compound last night ?

06:02.131 --> 06:03.266
yes,
master Splinter.

06:03.334 --> 06:05.369
and now the compound
has vanished

06:05.437 --> 06:06.705
without a trace.

06:06.772 --> 06:10.877
i fear my ancient enemy
Oroku Saki still lives.

06:10.945 --> 06:12.547
and i must join you

06:12.615 --> 06:15.251
in the search search
for this technodrome.

06:15.320 --> 06:16.854
that isn't a job for us.

06:16.922 --> 06:19.057
it's a job for
the department of sewers.

06:19.125 --> 06:21.561
Oroku Saki
is the most cunning

06:21.628 --> 06:23.463
and dangerous man
i know,

06:23.531 --> 06:26.869
and he is a ninja
of the first rank.

06:26.937 --> 06:28.272
i'll check
the news room.

06:28.339 --> 06:29.573
maybe there's been some word

06:29.641 --> 06:31.743
on just where
the technodrome went.

06:33.214 --> 06:35.216
quickly. our adversary
already has

06:35.284 --> 06:36.684
a headstart on us.

06:37.955 --> 06:40.490
headstart ?
we're gonna need sonar

06:40.558 --> 06:41.793
to find this geek.

06:41.860 --> 06:43.296
relax, Raphael,

06:43.363 --> 06:45.232
we've got Splinter
leading us now.

06:45.300 --> 06:46.499
yeah, Splinter
will find him,

06:46.567 --> 06:48.236
just like
sniffing out a rat.

06:48.304 --> 06:49.838
uh, heh, a weasel.

07:18.016 --> 07:20.186
<i>ok, buddy.
you're coming with us. </i>

07:40.085 --> 07:43.255
<i>just come along quietly,
and you won't get hurt. </i>

07:46.294 --> 07:47.896
<i>sorry for
the disturbance, folks. </i>

07:47.964 --> 07:49.265
<i>have a pleasant day. </i>

08:01.652 --> 08:04.689
oh, still no sign
of the technodrome.

08:04.757 --> 08:06.257
where's Tarzan
when we need him ?

08:08.229 --> 08:10.064
check this out.

08:13.571 --> 08:14.437
whoa !

08:16.107 --> 08:18.610
this way, i believe.

08:18.678 --> 08:21.114
that rock
is freshly drilled.

08:21.182 --> 08:23.718
look at the size of
those tank treads !

08:23.786 --> 08:26.657
that dude's driving
shea stadium around

08:26.724 --> 08:28.993
under the city.
ha ha ha !

08:29.061 --> 08:31.898
this could put
a serious crimp

08:31.966 --> 08:33.734
in our plans.

08:33.802 --> 08:35.403
head upward, my sons.

08:35.471 --> 08:38.073
find some way
around all this.

08:38.140 --> 08:41.412
i'll try to get
through somehow.

08:41.480 --> 08:43.515
through that ?

08:43.585 --> 08:46.854
oh, we rats can burrow
through anything.

08:50.461 --> 08:52.931
i need volunteers.

08:52.999 --> 08:56.570
aw, no, no way.
not me. uh-uh.

08:56.638 --> 08:59.441
yeah, we don't volunteer
for nothin'.

08:59.509 --> 09:02.779
i need 2 of you
for an experiment.

09:02.847 --> 09:04.416
ah, forget it.

09:04.483 --> 09:07.587
it will give you strength
and powers undreamed of.

09:07.655 --> 09:09.123
so what ?

09:09.190 --> 09:12.295
it will make you mightier
than a dozen mortal men.

09:12.362 --> 09:14.665
yeah ?
big hairy deal.

09:14.733 --> 09:16.501
it will enable you
to get even

09:16.569 --> 09:18.270
with the 4 turtles

09:18.338 --> 09:20.942
who so recently
humiliated you.

09:21.010 --> 09:22.177
where do i sign ?

09:22.244 --> 09:24.681
i'll do it ! yeah !

09:24.749 --> 09:28.721
ah, but i only need
2 volunteers.

09:30.224 --> 09:31.859
just sit.

09:35.599 --> 09:38.436
i wish i'd brought
some comics.

09:49.287 --> 09:52.190
uhh ? what you doing
to us, man ?

09:52.258 --> 09:54.227
just relax.

09:57.799 --> 10:01.204
what do you need
them animals for ?

10:01.272 --> 10:03.342
it's all part
of the experiment.

10:03.409 --> 10:05.979
are you sure
this is gonna give us

10:06.046 --> 10:08.883
all them, uh, powers
your promised us, man ?

10:08.951 --> 10:11.220
absolutely.

10:11.288 --> 10:13.557
of course, you may
have a little trouble

10:13.625 --> 10:15.393
getting a date
on saturday night.

10:19.534 --> 10:21.403
Donatello,

10:21.471 --> 10:23.739
you sure this is
getting us anywhere ?

10:23.807 --> 10:26.378
of course. every tunnel
leads somewhere.

10:26.445 --> 10:28.047
you picked
a heck of a time

10:28.115 --> 10:29.215
to become
a philosopher.

10:30.618 --> 10:32.353
now, everybody
be quiet.

10:32.421 --> 10:34.123
we don't want
to make a disturbance.

10:37.529 --> 10:38.897
i got a feelin'

10:38.964 --> 10:41.300
we're not in kansas
anymore, uncle toto.

10:41.368 --> 10:42.436
come on !

10:42.504 --> 10:44.372
we've got to get
out of here.

10:53.421 --> 10:55.689
and i thought
the sewers were bad.

10:59.196 --> 11:03.469
now that's what i call
a serious pizza.

11:03.537 --> 11:04.803
channel 6 ?

11:04.871 --> 11:07.542
isn't that the station
where April works ?

11:07.609 --> 11:09.911
3 days you've
been gone, April.

11:09.979 --> 11:11.847
and what do you
bring me ? zip !

11:11.915 --> 11:13.284
Vern,
listen to me.

11:13.352 --> 11:14.719
i'm on to
something big.

11:14.787 --> 11:17.423
save it. against
all better judgment,

11:17.492 --> 11:19.461
i'm gonna give you
another chance.

11:19.528 --> 11:21.830
somebody robbed the zoo
2 hours ago.

11:21.898 --> 11:24.367
the police report's
in the wire room.

11:24.435 --> 11:27.706
a zoo robbery ?
aw, come on.

11:27.773 --> 11:29.042
now, April.

11:29.110 --> 11:30.344
i get yelled at,

11:30.411 --> 11:32.080
i get scooped
on my story,

11:32.148 --> 11:33.883
i nearly get fired.

11:33.951 --> 11:36.353
all on account
of those turtles.

11:36.421 --> 11:38.891
yo, sister.
what's the haps ?

11:41.429 --> 11:44.033
give me a break, guys.

11:44.100 --> 11:46.936
we had to disguise
ourselves somehow.

11:47.004 --> 11:48.906
try to get serious
for a moment.

11:48.974 --> 11:51.377
i'm on a story could lead us
straight to the technodrome.

11:51.445 --> 11:53.814
2 hours ago,
a rhino and warthog

11:53.881 --> 11:56.084
were stolen
from the central park zoo.

12:01.393 --> 12:03.061
a rhino
and a warthog

12:03.129 --> 12:05.065
are gonna lead us
to the technodrome ?

12:05.132 --> 12:07.102
they were stolen
by a couple of robots

12:07.170 --> 12:08.703
who dragged them
underground.

12:08.772 --> 12:10.273
robots ?

12:10.341 --> 12:13.345
well, come on.
let's boogaloo.

12:20.856 --> 12:23.227
there must be
some way inside.

12:25.798 --> 12:26.965
<i>all right, buddy. </i>

12:27.033 --> 12:28.435
<i>just come along
peacefully. </i>

12:30.472 --> 12:33.108
<i>don't make this any
tougher on yourself. </i>

12:38.651 --> 12:40.754
April,
wait here for us.

12:40.822 --> 12:41.789
but--

12:41.857 --> 12:42.824
if this hole
caves in,

12:42.892 --> 12:44.059
we'll can dig
our way out.

12:44.127 --> 12:45.061
you can't.

12:45.129 --> 12:47.832
yeah. we know how
to handle ourselves

12:47.900 --> 12:49.968
in the sew--aah !

12:53.141 --> 12:56.478
whoa, man.
that was a short trip.

12:56.547 --> 12:58.749
master Splinter's
walking stick.

12:58.817 --> 13:00.385
he's never without it.

13:00.453 --> 13:01.820
he must be in trouble.

13:01.888 --> 13:05.025
indeed, he is. ha ha ha !

13:05.093 --> 13:06.961
if you want
to see him again,

13:07.029 --> 13:08.631
you'll have to come in.

13:08.699 --> 13:10.133
it's gotta be a trap.

13:10.201 --> 13:12.971
i hate it
when he says that.

13:13.039 --> 13:14.641
don't ask questions.

13:14.709 --> 13:17.010
just get a camera crew
down here now !

13:17.078 --> 13:19.448
what do you mean,
i got to have a story first ?

13:19.515 --> 13:21.452
<i>this is the story !</i>

13:21.519 --> 13:23.455
oh, yeah ? you, too !

13:25.425 --> 13:27.794
all right, now to find out

13:27.862 --> 13:30.966
how good these turtles
really are.

13:31.033 --> 13:35.306
get the feeling somebody
has it in for us ?

13:37.209 --> 13:38.844
so, how do we get out ?

13:38.912 --> 13:40.213
there is no way out.

13:40.281 --> 13:42.250
well, that's kind of
a defeatist attitude,

13:42.317 --> 13:44.219
don't you think ?
what about that ?

13:44.287 --> 13:46.657
it could take hours
to crack the code.

13:46.725 --> 13:48.560
try 15 seconds, chum.

13:48.628 --> 13:51.164
Leonardo, cut it open.

13:53.469 --> 13:55.271
i feel like
a marshmallow

13:55.338 --> 13:56.572
in a nutcracker.

13:58.577 --> 14:00.279
take your time,
why don't you ?

14:05.287 --> 14:06.855
lights out.

14:06.922 --> 14:09.759
<i>help ! hey, no fair.
that hurt. </i>

14:09.827 --> 14:11.229
so long, guys.

14:11.297 --> 14:13.399
hey, write us
when you hit bottom.

14:13.467 --> 14:14.734
ha ha !

14:14.802 --> 14:18.740
<i>you won't get rid
of us that easy. </i>

14:18.808 --> 14:22.680
this must be some kind
of manufacturing plant.

14:25.119 --> 14:27.454
we are
in deep trouble.

14:36.369 --> 14:38.638
you think they want
to mix it up with us ?

14:38.706 --> 14:41.310
if they do, i don't
like the odds.

14:41.377 --> 14:43.246
yeah, we were trained
to fight people,

14:43.314 --> 14:44.648
not can openers.

14:44.716 --> 14:46.851
so, like,
what do we do ?

14:46.919 --> 14:47.919
you and Raphael,

14:47.987 --> 14:49.488
cut around
to either side.

14:49.556 --> 14:50.490
Donatello,

14:50.558 --> 14:51.859
try to get
to their rear.

14:51.927 --> 14:53.094
what will you do,
Leonardo ?

14:53.161 --> 14:55.565
well, somebody's gotta
take the middle.

14:55.633 --> 14:57.167
attack !

15:01.675 --> 15:02.610
hyah.

15:02.677 --> 15:03.978
rude, dude.

15:13.561 --> 15:15.563
turtles fight
with honor.

15:17.567 --> 15:19.436
taste cold steel.

15:24.611 --> 15:26.580
uhh. get funky !

15:35.361 --> 15:37.664
<i>hurry.
we must stop them. </i>

15:37.732 --> 15:39.400
get him,
Michelangelo !

15:46.580 --> 15:48.515
aah !

15:48.583 --> 15:49.749
get out of my face !

16:05.708 --> 16:07.811
our rear flank's
cut off, sarge !

16:12.853 --> 16:14.020
pblblblbt !

16:15.190 --> 16:16.459
this way.

16:29.412 --> 16:32.783
i'd say we redecorated
the place nicely.

16:38.427 --> 16:40.362
more bad news.

16:40.430 --> 16:42.299
didn't i tell you ?

16:53.617 --> 16:54.952
hit it,
Leonardo.

17:09.576 --> 17:12.378
Splinter. i'll cut
you down, master.

17:12.446 --> 17:14.549
i must congratulate you.

17:14.616 --> 17:17.721
it's the same guys
we fought last night.

17:17.788 --> 17:21.393
you passed your test
with flying colors.

17:21.461 --> 17:23.563
test ? what test ?

17:23.630 --> 17:28.704
your hairy little friend
knows me as Oroku Saki,

17:28.772 --> 17:31.342
but you may call me...

17:31.409 --> 17:33.378
the Shredder.

17:33.446 --> 17:34.681
a kitchen utensil ?

17:34.748 --> 17:37.384
you would be wise to
lose your flippant ways

17:37.452 --> 17:40.356
if you wish to join
the honorable foot clan.

17:40.423 --> 17:42.759
why should we
want to do that ?

17:42.827 --> 17:45.397
because it was i
who made you

17:45.465 --> 17:47.166
what you are today.

17:47.234 --> 17:49.069
if not for me,

17:49.137 --> 17:52.441
Hamato Yoshi would never
have left japan.

17:52.510 --> 17:54.444
i followed him
to this country,

17:54.513 --> 17:56.615
where i gained
my advanced technology,

17:56.682 --> 18:00.453
including my rare
experimental mutagen.

18:00.522 --> 18:02.892
it was i who caused you
to mutate

18:02.959 --> 18:04.460
into your humanoid form.

18:04.529 --> 18:07.097
you owe everything to me !

18:07.165 --> 18:11.939
don't deny your destiny.
join me.

18:13.442 --> 18:15.111
does the phrase
"go suck a lemon"

18:15.179 --> 18:16.813
hold any meaning
for you ?

18:16.881 --> 18:18.616
let's cut
him down !

18:18.684 --> 18:22.255
very well.
i have my own mutants.

18:22.322 --> 18:23.656
bebop...

18:23.724 --> 18:25.325
rock steady...

18:25.394 --> 18:26.895
destroy them !

18:26.962 --> 18:28.063
grrr.

18:28.131 --> 18:31.302
with great pleasure,
master Shredder.

18:31.370 --> 18:33.272
grrr !

18:33.339 --> 18:34.808
arr !

18:34.876 --> 18:35.976
jump for it !

18:37.512 --> 18:39.816
you idiots !

18:39.884 --> 18:43.421
the mutation didn't
up their iqs any.

19:02.685 --> 19:04.053
come on, Splinter.

19:04.120 --> 19:06.022
we're checking out
of this dump.

19:06.090 --> 19:08.093
come on,
you fools.

19:10.932 --> 19:13.935
i just hope i haven't
missed out on the action !

19:23.952 --> 19:25.720
rest here a moment,
master.

19:25.789 --> 19:28.025
you know, that was
almost too easy.

19:28.092 --> 19:30.461
i really wish you'd stop
saying things like that.

19:35.837 --> 19:37.772
rarrr !

19:37.840 --> 19:40.411
say your prayers,
turtles.

19:42.247 --> 19:45.451
come on, let's annihilate
those turkeys !

19:50.827 --> 19:52.662
<i>didn't i see you
in the jungle book ?</i>

20:03.747 --> 20:05.082
ooh. what the--

20:06.284 --> 20:07.552
aw, this is ridiculous.

20:07.620 --> 20:09.289
we're never gonna
stop those guys.

20:09.356 --> 20:11.691
yeah, those jerks
belong in a zoo,

20:11.760 --> 20:13.295
not the streets.

20:13.362 --> 20:15.799
Michelangelo,
that's a brilliant notion.

20:15.866 --> 20:17.235
come on.

20:23.579 --> 20:25.347
where'd they go ?

20:25.415 --> 20:28.519
the party's over here !

20:30.756 --> 20:33.727
now for
the final showdown.

20:35.864 --> 20:38.969
sorry. we'll have to take
a rain check on that.

20:47.816 --> 20:49.651
now, you boys
have fun together,

20:49.719 --> 20:51.521
and we'll be back
to check on you

20:51.589 --> 20:53.124
in about 10 years.

20:53.192 --> 20:55.427
dumb, dumb, dumb.

20:55.495 --> 20:58.166
those dudes
are so dumb !

21:01.705 --> 21:04.741
ok, guys,
where's the action ?

21:04.809 --> 21:06.444
afraid you missed
the good stuff.

21:06.512 --> 21:09.949
ohh. well,
that's just great.

21:10.017 --> 21:12.120
of course
you could get a shot

21:12.189 --> 21:14.357
of those 2 bozos.

21:16.695 --> 21:18.564
get back here
and fight,

21:18.631 --> 21:21.435
you little
web-footed creeps.

21:21.503 --> 21:22.971
oh, wow !

21:23.038 --> 21:25.307
ooh,
the little bimbo !

21:25.376 --> 21:29.749
i'll make you eat
that camera. grrr !

21:29.816 --> 21:31.852
where'd those guys
come from ?

21:31.919 --> 21:34.255
come on. we must
get Splinter home.

21:34.322 --> 21:35.591
let's take the van.

21:35.658 --> 21:37.794
i'm not letting you guys
out of my sight

21:37.862 --> 21:40.163
until i've gotten
the whole story.

21:40.232 --> 21:41.565
you'll get it.

21:41.633 --> 21:43.602
remember, the Shredder's
still loose.

21:43.670 --> 21:45.405
and probably
trucking around

21:45.473 --> 21:47.876
in that
technodrome again.

22:00.864 --> 22:03.501
what took you
so long ?

22:03.569 --> 22:04.969
<i>the Shredder
wants to have</i>

22:05.038 --> 22:07.040
<i>a little talk
with you. </i>

22:07.107 --> 22:09.343
uh, you couldn't
maybe put us back

22:09.411 --> 22:12.148
in that cage there,
could you ?
