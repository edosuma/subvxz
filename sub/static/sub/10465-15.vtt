37:46.868 --> 37:49.400
Mm, we were people watching

37:49.400 --> 37:51.734
and this really dorky couple
walked by,

37:51.734 --> 37:54.968
and Justin just sort
of gave me this smile.

37:54.968 --> 37:56.033
And before he said a word,

37:56.033 --> 37:57.634
I knew what he was thinking,
you know.

37:57.634 --> 38:00.133
[LAUGHS]
Us. Tenth grade.

38:00.133 --> 38:02.767
And so I realized
that I knew him completely,

38:02.767 --> 38:05.501
which was great.

38:05.501 --> 38:06.667
Hm.

38:07.634 --> 38:09.934
Not me.

38:09.934 --> 38:12.767
For me it was when I realized
I didn't know her at all.

38:12.767 --> 38:16.367
The idea that she'd keep
on surprising me,

38:16.367 --> 38:19.367
I couldn't think
of anything cooler.

38:19.367 --> 38:21.234
Wow. Total opposites.

38:21.234 --> 38:23.200
You think that means
that we're incompatible

38:23.200 --> 38:25.501
or you think it's one
of those Venus/Mars things

38:25.501 --> 38:27.534
and it's actually
a really great sign?

38:29.567 --> 38:31.601
I have no idea.

38:41.667 --> 38:44.100
Why are you sitting so far away?

38:51.634 --> 38:53.234
So tell me,
where were you when you had

38:53.234 --> 38:55.567
this erroneous revelation?

38:56.701 --> 38:59.367
At the end of a runway.

38:59.367 --> 39:00.734
Models or airplanes?

39:00.734 --> 39:03.067
Airplanes.
Mm.

39:03.067 --> 39:04.400
Karen had this thing.

39:04.400 --> 39:07.434
She couldn't believe
they actually left the ground.

39:07.434 --> 39:09.367
So she'd take me to runways,

39:09.367 --> 39:11.834
and she'd just scream

39:11.834 --> 39:13.400
when the wheels lifted.
[LAUGHS]

39:13.400 --> 39:16.901
No offense, but, um,
she sounds nuts.

39:16.901 --> 39:17.901
I know.

39:17.901 --> 39:20.167
That's how she won me over.

39:21.467 --> 39:23.100
Where were you?

39:24.634 --> 39:25.767
The beach.

39:25.767 --> 39:28.734
Excellent people watching
at the beach.

39:28.734 --> 39:30.534
Something about people
in bathing suits,

39:30.534 --> 39:32.968
you can't hide a thing.

39:32.968 --> 39:34.901
How about this British
comedy festival?

39:34.901 --> 39:38.100
Tonight it's
 <i>Kind Hearts and Coronets.</i>

39:38.100 --> 39:40.200
Heard anything?
It's great.

39:40.200 --> 39:41.434
I've already seen it.

39:41.434 --> 39:42.667
No. This is for me and Michael.

39:44.033 --> 39:46.100
Oh.

39:46.100 --> 39:49.901
So great. You say that's great,
so it plays at 10:15.

39:49.901 --> 39:52.000
So that leaves us time
to get a cup of coffee.

39:52.000 --> 39:55.334
Grace, um,
can you do me a favor?

39:57.734 --> 39:59.534
[SIGHS]

39:59.534 --> 40:01.467
Could you not see him?

40:01.467 --> 40:02.634
What?

40:03.601 --> 40:05.634
I don't want you to see him.

40:05.634 --> 40:07.467
Don't see him?

40:07.467 --> 40:08.834
Charlie, you're serious?

40:08.834 --> 40:11.234
Yeah.

40:11.234 --> 40:12.667
Why? Does this have
to do with him?

40:13.734 --> 40:14.734
No.

40:15.834 --> 40:18.133
Then what?
I mean, what are you saying?

40:19.167 --> 40:21.501
I'm saying...

40:21.501 --> 40:24.734
I'm saying, um,

40:24.734 --> 40:27.000
that you matter to me.

40:28.534 --> 40:30.534
Okay.

40:30.534 --> 40:32.334
I guess-- Well, that's great,

40:32.334 --> 40:33.534
but I still don't...

40:36.701 --> 40:38.200
What are you offering me,
Charlie?

40:38.200 --> 40:40.400
Are you saying
something's gonna happen?

40:41.968 --> 40:43.234
I don't know.

40:44.167 --> 40:47.000
I don't know. I--

40:47.000 --> 40:49.167
Then Charlie,
I don't know what you mean.

40:50.300 --> 40:51.634
I mean, I know we're friends,

40:51.634 --> 40:53.534
but I don't know what else.

40:53.534 --> 40:56.133
[***]

41:01.234 --> 41:04.267
Are you saying that we're more?

41:06.701 --> 41:09.701
Are you saying
that we're the kind of friends

41:09.701 --> 41:12.934
who think about each other
when we're not together?

41:14.567 --> 41:15.868
Mm-hm.

41:17.534 --> 41:20.033
And when we see each other

41:20.033 --> 41:21.267
for a second or two,

41:21.267 --> 41:23.400
do we kind
of forget everything else?

41:28.934 --> 41:31.067
So then are we--?

41:31.067 --> 41:33.167
Are you saying we might--?

41:33.167 --> 41:34.634
You and me?

41:35.901 --> 41:37.367
Yeah.

41:37.367 --> 41:39.200
[LAUGHS]

41:39.200 --> 41:41.300
I think we might.

41:50.133 --> 41:52.767
But the pin,

41:52.767 --> 41:55.067
that's not the hardest part.

41:55.067 --> 41:56.901
The hardest part's the reversal.

41:56.901 --> 41:58.801
You know why?

42:00.067 --> 42:01.868
Can we get another?

42:02.567 --> 42:03.601
I'll tell you why.

42:03.601 --> 42:05.901
The reversal's the hardest

42:05.901 --> 42:09.100
because it's when you're
the most sure you're dead.

42:09.100 --> 42:12.367
You made
some dumb mistake like you--

42:12.367 --> 42:15.100
You-- You didn't--
Bridge or you dropped your head,

42:15.100 --> 42:17.767
and now the damn thing's
just crushing you in the chest.

42:19.934 --> 42:22.334
But the thing that saves you

42:22.334 --> 42:24.467
is that everybody
makes mistakes.

42:25.701 --> 42:27.901
And when it happens to him,

42:27.901 --> 42:30.200
you just gotta grab onto it

42:30.200 --> 42:31.734
and turn it back onto him

42:31.734 --> 42:33.234
until he's the guy on the bottom

42:33.234 --> 42:35.067
and you are on top.

42:37.767 --> 42:39.634
And that was me tonight.

42:40.501 --> 42:41.968
That guy on top.

42:44.200 --> 42:45.434
He was me.

42:45.434 --> 42:49.100
 <i>* All will find eventually *</i>

42:49.934 --> 42:52.501
 <i>* We are free *</i>
