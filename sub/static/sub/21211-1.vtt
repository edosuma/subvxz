05:16.516 --> 05:17.883
Hi.

05:28.594 --> 05:30.429
- Hey.
- What's up, baby?

05:30.431 --> 05:32.097
What are you working on?

05:32.099 --> 05:34.566
Nothing.
What are you cooking?

05:34.568 --> 05:37.869
- Eggs.
- Yeah?

05:37.871 --> 05:40.772
I don't understand you. You're out all
night long, working your ass off,

05:40.774 --> 05:42.407
then all you want to do
when you get home

05:42.409 --> 05:46.578
is go out in the backyard
and bang away on stuff.

05:46.580 --> 05:50.048
Tell me that you're drinking
out of the carton again.

05:50.050 --> 05:52.084
Frank, Jesus Christ,
what did you do?

05:52.086 --> 05:54.619
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, my god, you're bleeding everywhere.

05:54.621 --> 05:56.621
- I just nicked it before and...
- oh, you nicked it?

05:56.623 --> 05:58.590
- Look at you. You're a mess.
- Sorry. Ah!

05:58.592 --> 06:00.959
Will you put this... oh, my god,
put this in there.

06:00.961 --> 06:03.028
Ugh, it's all over the floor.

06:05.465 --> 06:07.499
Ahem.

06:07.501 --> 06:09.434
Sorry, baby.

06:15.808 --> 06:18.777
- Who's, uh, fizzy?
- Oh, that's...

06:18.779 --> 06:21.046
That's my, uh,
my girlfriend from work.

06:21.048 --> 06:22.681
Just one of the other nurses.

06:22.683 --> 06:25.584
- Oh, yeah?
- She is hysterical.

06:31.557 --> 06:33.125
Here.

06:33.127 --> 06:34.726
- Eat.
- Thanks.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.027
Will you let me look
at this, please?

06:36.029 --> 06:37.562
I'm fine, really. It's fine.

06:37.564 --> 06:38.830
Take that off of there
and let me see it.

06:38.832 --> 06:41.900
Gina, I'm good. Okay?

06:41.902 --> 06:45.570
- Okay.
- Why you gotta be so stubborn for?

06:45.572 --> 06:47.439
I'm good.

06:47.441 --> 06:50.876
- You're a Scootch.
- Yeah.

06:50.878 --> 06:52.577
All right, I gotta head out
and, uh,

06:52.579 --> 06:54.413
get some things done today,
so I'm gonna get ready.

06:54.415 --> 06:56.815
- All right.
- You working later tonight?

06:56.817 --> 07:00.752
Yeah. I'm going to see
Charlie first.

07:00.754 --> 07:02.020
Oh.

07:02.022 --> 07:04.456
Shit, I forgot that's today.

07:05.691 --> 07:08.760
You all right?

07:08.762 --> 07:10.495
Yeah, I think so.
I don't even know.

07:10.497 --> 07:12.063
I guess.

07:13.933 --> 07:16.968
Yeah, I'm good.
I'm good.

07:16.970 --> 07:18.837
Did you hear back from
your mom yet at all?

07:18.839 --> 07:20.872
- No.
- Seriously?

07:20.874 --> 07:23.708
- Yeah.
- Okay.

07:23.710 --> 07:25.911
At this point,
she's just being mean.

07:25.913 --> 07:27.646
She's being a bitch.

07:27.648 --> 07:29.147
How many times
can your own son call you

07:29.149 --> 07:32.017
and you don't call him back?

07:32.019 --> 07:35.086
Ugh. You know what? Maybe it's time
to just let it go for a little while.

07:36.956 --> 07:38.557
Yeah.

07:39.926 --> 07:42.561
It's your call.

07:42.563 --> 07:45.530
Hey, I love you.

07:45.532 --> 07:47.132
Okay.

07:48.868 --> 07:51.803
- I said I love you.
- I love you, too.

07:51.805 --> 07:54.873
All right, do your thing.
I'm good.

07:56.609 --> 07:58.176
Kiss it.

08:01.914 --> 08:02.981
Okay.

08:19.999 --> 08:23.235
- Frank
- hey.

08:23.237 --> 08:25.937
- Been a while.
- Yeah. How's it going, Joe?

08:25.939 --> 08:28.974
- How you doing?
- Good, good.

08:28.976 --> 08:31.142
Nah, just ice water is fine.

08:31.144 --> 08:33.712
- Ice water?
- Yeah.

08:33.714 --> 08:36.780
Whatever you say.
Ice water coming right up.

08:43.054 --> 08:44.823
Ahem.

08:55.668 --> 08:57.736
How you doing?

09:04.310 --> 09:06.578
Yeah, I'm doing all right.

09:17.256 --> 09:19.558
It's a good game. I haven't
watched the games in a while.

09:19.560 --> 09:21.626
I've been working nights.

09:23.829 --> 09:25.630
What do you want, frank?

09:35.675 --> 09:37.242
To talk.

09:39.579 --> 09:43.081
Just to see you.

09:43.083 --> 09:47.319
It's been five years, you know?

09:47.321 --> 09:49.754
Five quiet years.

10:00.199 --> 10:02.968
Things are different, Charlie.

10:02.970 --> 10:05.337
Why?
'Cause you're drinking water?

10:05.339 --> 10:08.139
No. No.

10:08.141 --> 10:11.343
God, I can barely look
at the stuff anymore.

10:11.345 --> 10:14.346
I'm even thinking about...

10:14.348 --> 10:16.181
Becoming a counselor
or something.

10:20.920 --> 10:22.787
Me, right?

10:24.390 --> 10:25.824
Yeah.

10:30.696 --> 10:33.398
Gina's doing good.
She said hello.

10:36.736 --> 10:38.837
She, uh, she's a nurse.

10:38.839 --> 10:40.905
She's doing great, actually.

10:40.907 --> 10:43.942
She's cooking a lot now.

10:43.944 --> 10:46.945
Like mom used to.
Not as good as mom, but...

10:49.315 --> 10:54.319
- Yeah.
- I don't know you, Frankie.

10:54.321 --> 10:56.154
Your mother neither.

10:56.156 --> 10:59.224
I don't think we ever did.

10:59.226 --> 11:01.092
So what's there to talk about?

11:05.831 --> 11:07.198
Right.

11:28.721 --> 11:29.921
All right.

11:32.858 --> 11:36.061
All right.

11:36.063 --> 11:38.096
I'll let... I'll let you
get back to the game.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.268
Hey, frank, take it easy.

11:51.911 --> 11:53.845
Was hoping I'd find you here.

11:53.847 --> 11:55.747
Get off my fucking truck,
Travis.

11:55.749 --> 11:57.282
Are you stupid?

11:57.284 --> 12:00.085
Oh, like I'm going to fucking
make any more damage.

12:00.087 --> 12:02.754
What's up?

12:02.756 --> 12:05.724
Just wanted to hang out.
Want to burn one?

12:05.726 --> 12:08.059
Um...

12:08.061 --> 12:10.095
Yeah, whatever.

12:10.097 --> 12:12.163
Can I have a cigarette?

12:21.474 --> 12:23.742
That's my lighter.

12:25.144 --> 12:27.779
Old man in there?

12:27.781 --> 12:29.180
Yep.

12:29.182 --> 12:31.750
How's he doing?

12:31.752 --> 12:33.184
He's all right.

12:35.488 --> 12:37.856
Same old cock?

12:37.858 --> 12:39.424
Sorry.

12:41.026 --> 12:42.761
All right, what?
What's up? Come on.

12:42.763 --> 12:45.063
All right, well,
I hate to bug you about it,

12:45.065 --> 12:48.500
but I kind of need to know where you're
landing on this whole helping me out thing.

12:50.236 --> 12:52.370
- Aw, come on, huh. Jesus.
- Come on. The...

12:52.372 --> 12:55.774
listen, the VIG's gonna go up. They're
gonna end up breaking my legs.

12:55.776 --> 12:57.842
Come on, man, I need your help.

13:02.348 --> 13:07.418
- When?
- It's tomorrow night.

13:07.420 --> 13:09.154
Listen, you can help me out
or you can push me around

13:09.156 --> 13:10.355
in a wheelchair
the rest of your life.

13:10.357 --> 13:11.456
I don't give a fuck about that.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.198
I wouldn't push you anywhere.

13:15.361 --> 13:17.829
All right, that's it though,
Travis, really.

13:17.831 --> 13:19.798
No more, okay?

13:19.800 --> 13:23.101
Yeah, sure. Me, too.
I mean, this is it.

13:23.103 --> 13:25.370
I'm serious, man.
I'm not kidding.

13:25.372 --> 13:27.338
- I know.
- All right.

13:27.340 --> 13:29.541
Hey, I got time for a couple of drinks.
You wanna go in? Hang out?

13:29.543 --> 13:32.177
- No, I gotta go to work.
- Come on, man.

13:32.179 --> 13:33.945
No, I gotta go.

13:40.886 --> 13:42.453
Gina.

13:49.261 --> 13:51.496
G!

13:51.498 --> 13:53.264
You fucking kidding me?

14:13.986 --> 14:16.120
Gina, fucking stop.
What are you doing?

14:16.122 --> 14:19.424
- Sorry. Drying my hair.
- I'm working today.

14:19.426 --> 14:21.860
Trying to get a couple of hours of
sleep in this morning, you know?

14:21.862 --> 14:24.929
- All right, sorry. I'm done.
- Damn it.

14:26.999 --> 14:32.403
Um, oh, did you pick up
my prescription yesterday?

14:32.405 --> 14:34.873
Oh, shit. I forgot.

14:34.875 --> 14:38.943
I went over there yesterday to get it and
the pharmacy said that it's expired.

14:38.945 --> 14:40.445
You need to call into
the doctor's office.

14:40.447 --> 14:42.480
Ah, shit, really?

14:42.482 --> 14:45.083
Yeah. You're gonna have to make an
appointment and get over there.

14:45.085 --> 14:47.318
Sorry.
Do you want me to do it?

14:47.320 --> 14:50.321
- No. No, I'll do it.
- All right.

14:50.323 --> 14:54.359
They said you have two that are expired.
Both of them.

14:54.361 --> 14:57.328
You need to get them
both refilled.

14:57.330 --> 15:00.331
What's the other one for?

15:00.333 --> 15:02.634
It's the headaches.
They just gave me another one...

15:02.636 --> 15:05.270
you have two now?

15:05.272 --> 15:09.540
Yeah. What are you doing?
You going to work?

15:09.542 --> 15:10.942
Well, yeah, I'm going to work.

15:10.944 --> 15:13.244
You better call
the doctor's office now

15:13.246 --> 15:14.679
'cause it's gonna be tough for you to get
an appointment last minute like that.

15:14.681 --> 15:16.681
I will. Isn't that, like,
three shifts this week?

15:16.683 --> 15:18.950
Yes, babe.
I picked up another shift.

15:18.952 --> 15:21.386
Bills keep piling up.
Mama's gotta work.

15:21.388 --> 15:23.087
What do you want me to tell you?

15:23.089 --> 15:27.525
Are we going out later now?

15:27.527 --> 15:30.061
No. I'm going out
with Travis tonight.

15:30.063 --> 15:32.130
I'm gonna hang out with him.

15:32.132 --> 15:34.599
Okay, well, Travis
is hanging out with us.

15:34.601 --> 15:37.302
Because it's Veronica's birthday
and we're all getting together.

15:37.304 --> 15:41.372
So I'll assume that
that means yes.

15:41.374 --> 15:45.610
All right. Whatever.

15:45.612 --> 15:47.278
- Go back to sleep.
- All right.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.314
I love you.

15:49.316 --> 15:51.416
- Get some rest before you go into work.
- Okay.

15:51.418 --> 15:52.717
I gotta get going.

15:52.719 --> 15:55.386
All right.

15:55.388 --> 15:59.057
I love you.
See you later tonight.

15:59.059 --> 16:01.526
If you could get me in some time
today, that would be ideal.

16:04.997 --> 16:08.199
I'm sorry, Ma'am,
I really don't. I'm...

16:08.201 --> 16:13.071
Ma'am, just let me, um,
if... is...

16:13.073 --> 16:15.373
can I get in tomorrow
by any chance?

16:15.375 --> 16:19.677
Is there any openings?

16:19.679 --> 16:21.145
Well, that's really
none of your business.

16:21.147 --> 16:23.715
Sorry.
That's for the doctor, so...

16:23.717 --> 16:26.184
look, the doctor knows me.
Just tell him...

16:26.186 --> 16:27.652
can you just tell him it's...

16:27.654 --> 16:29.620
Ma'am, fucking...

16:29.622 --> 16:32.056
can you just...
I'm sorry.

16:32.058 --> 16:35.460
What's that?

16:35.462 --> 16:37.395
Look, can you get me in...

16:37.397 --> 16:40.298
can you make an appointment
for next week then?

16:40.300 --> 16:42.533
And then let me know if there's
any openings coming up

16:42.535 --> 16:46.270
and then I can jump in
if it's possible.

16:46.272 --> 16:48.072
Why not? Why can't...

16:48.074 --> 16:50.375
I cannot wait another week.

16:55.681 --> 16:58.483
All right.
All right, fine.

16:58.485 --> 17:01.152
That's good.
Yep, great.

17:46.098 --> 17:48.499
Hey, look who finally showed up.

17:48.501 --> 17:50.234
- I'm sorry. Happy birthday.
- Well, well, well.

17:50.236 --> 17:52.804
Yeah, frank. Good to see you.
Glad you could make it.

17:52.806 --> 17:56.407
- Okay. Hi, baby.
- Caught up with more overtime?

17:56.409 --> 17:58.209
A little bit. Yeah.
Sorry.

17:58.211 --> 18:01.312
And somehow Travis
manages to make it on time.

18:01.314 --> 18:03.214
Because Travis
loves dollar drafts.

18:03.216 --> 18:05.216
- That's why he's here early.
- Mm-hmm.

18:05.218 --> 18:10.455
- Leave him alone.
- I took the Liberty of ordering you water.

18:10.457 --> 18:12.223
Thanks.

18:13.459 --> 18:15.426
I don't, uh...

18:15.428 --> 18:18.262
I don't understand why you think
it's cool being here right now.

18:18.264 --> 18:20.631
Babe, it's fine.

18:20.633 --> 18:21.799
What's the problem?
It's symbolic.

18:21.801 --> 18:23.434
Yeah, so's the chip.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.303
- Yeah, this is better.
- Is it?

18:25.305 --> 18:28.573
Yes. We are spitting in the face
of temptation.

18:28.575 --> 18:32.410
- Okay.
- Plus, I like the ambiance.

18:32.412 --> 18:35.847
- And they have pool.
- All right, good.

18:35.849 --> 18:37.715
- Let's play.
- All right.

18:37.717 --> 18:39.150
- Hey.
- What?

18:39.152 --> 18:41.853
- You all right?
- Yeah. Why?

18:41.855 --> 18:43.287
What's the matter?
You're sweaty.

18:43.289 --> 18:45.490
- I'm fine. I'm good.
- You sure?

18:45.492 --> 18:47.258
Mm-hmm.

18:56.301 --> 19:01.439
- I'm good. I'm good.
- Give me a second. I'll be right back.

19:01.441 --> 19:06.144
All right.
Okay, okay.

19:06.146 --> 19:07.445
Come on. You're on my team.
It's your turn.

19:07.447 --> 19:10.748
Why am I here?

19:10.750 --> 19:14.218
Whatever you can do
with this mess I've created.

19:14.220 --> 19:15.786
Figure something out.

19:24.296 --> 19:25.897
Sorry, guys.
We gotta head off.

19:25.899 --> 19:28.332
- What's up?
- Listen.

19:28.334 --> 19:30.401
Frank and I gotta take care
of something, okay?

19:30.403 --> 19:32.370
- You, too?
- Yeah, I gotta go.

19:32.372 --> 19:34.472
- You guys just got here.
- We just, um,

19:34.474 --> 19:37.742
he wants to decorate her house
for her birthday, so...

19:37.744 --> 19:39.577
- all right?
- You ready, frank?

19:39.579 --> 19:42.580
Mm-hmm.
I'll see you later.

19:42.582 --> 19:44.649
Okay. See you.

20:15.682 --> 20:17.415
- It doesn't, uh...
- what?

20:17.417 --> 20:18.950
It doesn't go like that.

20:18.952 --> 20:20.785
I know, but I don't like
doing the bass.

20:20.787 --> 20:23.921
I like it higher.
It's more joyful. What?

20:23.923 --> 20:26.891
It's never gonna give up.

20:26.893 --> 20:29.227
- Never gonna let you down.
- You mean I'm wrong on the lyrics?

20:29.229 --> 20:30.394
- Yeah.
- No.

20:30.396 --> 20:32.997
- Yeah, you are.
- No fucking way.

20:32.999 --> 20:34.899
Been listening to that song for years.
I know how it goes.

20:41.741 --> 20:43.507
- Desert you.
- No, it's not desert you.

20:43.509 --> 20:46.611
No, it is. Why would you run
around and then hurt you.

20:46.613 --> 20:48.613
You come around to hurt. You don't
run around. You come around.

20:48.615 --> 20:50.381
You ain't gonna run around
and desert either.

20:50.383 --> 20:52.516
- It's run around...
- well, it's a fucking song.

20:52.518 --> 20:54.585
It doesn't have to fucking
make sense.

20:57.789 --> 20:59.857
They should be here
any minute anyway.

21:08.034 --> 21:09.800
Hurt you's first.

21:13.006 --> 21:14.772
There they are.

21:30.022 --> 21:31.789
Holy shit.

21:34.860 --> 21:37.028
Are you fucking kidding me?

21:50.842 --> 21:53.444
Hey, Mickey.
Nice to finally meet you.

21:53.446 --> 21:55.513
Travis.
What's up, Niko?

22:05.324 --> 22:08.092
Frank. Is that frank...
is that frank Pierce?

22:08.094 --> 22:10.094
Yeah. Yeah.

22:11.463 --> 22:13.064
Is that you frank?

22:13.066 --> 22:15.399
How you doing, Mick?

22:15.401 --> 22:19.370
This is frank?

22:19.372 --> 22:22.440
Yeah. Wait a second.
How you been?

22:26.011 --> 22:28.546
Been good.

22:28.548 --> 22:31.849
Yeah. Yeah.
You look different.

22:35.087 --> 22:38.122
Last I heard, you met some broad
and you settled down.

22:38.124 --> 22:40.358
Yeah.
Couple of years now.

22:40.360 --> 22:44.795
Yeah. Ain't it something
what a couple of years can do?

22:44.797 --> 22:46.864
Things change, huh?

22:49.701 --> 22:55.005
So. How's the old man doing
these days? You know?

22:55.007 --> 22:59.377
- I couldn't tell you.
- No? Yeah.

22:59.379 --> 23:01.512
Celia and I got divorced
a couple of years ago.

23:01.514 --> 23:04.415
Crystal? She's a big girl.
She's all grown up now.

23:04.417 --> 23:06.884
Still a pain in the ass. Dropped
out of a couple of colleges.

23:06.886 --> 23:08.953
Did a stint in rehab, you know.
She likes getting high.

23:08.955 --> 23:11.789
What are you gonna do?
Fuck it.

23:11.791 --> 23:15.025
Frank. Wow.

23:18.997 --> 23:21.999
- Who the fuck is this guy?
- Niko, this is... relax, man.

23:22.001 --> 23:24.568
- Something funny over there?
- Nothing's funny.

23:24.570 --> 23:26.904
- I mean I'm funny sometimes.
- Your fucking face is funny.

23:26.906 --> 23:28.873
- Oh, stop it, man.
- What's up, cue ball?

23:28.875 --> 23:30.441
- Who the fuck you talking to?
- Frank, frank.

23:30.443 --> 23:32.777
- Chill out, okay? Chill out.
- Fuck you.

23:32.779 --> 23:34.712
Hey, shh. Come on, frank.
Just like the old days.

23:34.714 --> 23:37.114
You and me. All right?
Come on. Let's go.

23:37.116 --> 23:38.849
Bitch.

23:38.851 --> 23:40.851
Hey, it's the black guys!
What's going on?

23:43.422 --> 23:44.789
I'm afraid of black people.

23:44.791 --> 23:46.824
That's good.
I'm afraid of white people.

23:46.826 --> 23:50.027
Hey, I'm good. What's going on?
Hey, man. What's up?

23:50.029 --> 23:52.530
We gotta fucking deal with
these fucking Moulinyans?

23:52.532 --> 23:54.799
- What the fuck did you say?
- Hey, hey, hey, hey. Be cool. Be cool. Ignore him.

23:54.801 --> 23:56.901
- Fuck you, man.
- Ignore this motherfucker.

23:56.903 --> 23:58.702
It's me. It's me, man.
Come on, man.

23:58.704 --> 24:00.137
It's my money, all right?
Just deal with me, okay?

24:00.139 --> 24:02.173
Let me taste that, okay?

24:02.175 --> 24:04.642
- We cool?
- Yeah, we cool. Where's the money?

24:04.644 --> 24:06.777
- It's right there.
- Take the fucking money.

24:06.779 --> 24:11.482
Be cool, man. Ignore him.
He's a racist, okay?

24:11.484 --> 24:13.117
Good. You'll like this.
It's white.

24:13.119 --> 24:14.752
It's white?

24:16.655 --> 24:18.689
All right. Here we go.

24:18.691 --> 24:22.159
- All right.
- Taste that. Good shit.

24:22.161 --> 24:25.563
It looks good.
Let's hope it is good, huh.

24:25.565 --> 24:29.033
Oh, yeah.

24:30.202 --> 24:31.936
That's bomb.

24:34.873 --> 24:37.041
Oh, fuck!
What the fuck?

24:37.043 --> 24:40.544
Niko! What the fuck?

24:40.546 --> 24:43.047
- What the fuck was that?
- Come on, come on.

24:43.049 --> 24:45.082
Hey. That's for frank.

24:45.084 --> 24:46.984
Wait for the next call.

24:50.755 --> 24:53.591
Go. Just drive the fucking car.
Let's go.

24:53.593 --> 24:55.059
- They just fucking shot him.
- Make a right.

24:55.061 --> 24:59.063
Fuck. How the fuck
do you know Mickey?

24:59.065 --> 25:00.598
How the fuck do you know Mickey?

25:00.600 --> 25:03.033
- Just drive.
- Jesus fuck.

25:03.035 --> 25:05.569
I fucking brought Dante in
and they fucking killed him,

25:05.571 --> 25:09.106
they just fucking shot him
for no fucking reason.

25:09.108 --> 25:11.976
Stupid fucking...
I don't fucking know.

25:11.978 --> 25:14.111
Pull over at the stop sign.

25:14.113 --> 25:15.946
- Quit talking.
- Fucking...

25:15.948 --> 25:17.748
- I ain't fucking stopping.
- Just pull it over.

25:17.750 --> 25:20.084
I'm fucking pulled over.
Where the fuck you going?

25:20.086 --> 25:22.920
You want to play with the big boys?
That's what you get.

25:22.922 --> 25:26.524
- He fucking owns you now.
- Frank, what the fuck are you... frank!

25:56.988 --> 26:00.057
Hey, Donny. What I tell you
about coming to that bar, man?

26:00.059 --> 26:02.693
Fucking embarrass me in front
of my girl? What the fuck?

26:02.695 --> 26:03.994
You owe me money.

26:03.996 --> 26:05.663
I don't give a fuck
what you told me.

26:05.665 --> 26:07.698
You fucking kidding me?
I don't make enough for you?

26:07.700 --> 26:10.601
Seriously?
Jesus fucking Christ. Here.

26:10.603 --> 26:12.269
I got that.
How's that feel? Huh?

26:12.271 --> 26:13.871
- Oh.
- That all right?

26:13.873 --> 26:15.839
Where'd you get
a stack like this?

26:15.841 --> 26:19.710
You finally decide to suck dick?

26:19.712 --> 26:21.245
- Yeah, I said it.
- Yeah.

26:21.247 --> 26:22.746
Go fuck yourself, Donny.

26:22.748 --> 26:24.815
Yeah, how much do I
gotta pay you?

26:44.669 --> 26:46.804
Hello?

26:46.806 --> 26:50.174
Hey. Hey, it's frank.

26:54.780 --> 26:57.047
Must be a full moon tonight.
You picked up.

27:00.151 --> 27:01.352
How're you doing?
What are you up to?

27:02.988 --> 27:05.789
Just watching the game.

27:05.791 --> 27:09.259
Top of the fourth,
already two errors.

27:09.261 --> 27:12.162
Yeah, they're hot and cold
lately. I know.

27:12.164 --> 27:14.264
I know.

27:14.266 --> 27:17.835
Hey, it was really good
seeing you yesterday.

27:17.837 --> 27:19.903
Yeah. You, too.

27:21.339 --> 27:25.275
Hey, I wanted to talk to you
about something.

27:25.277 --> 27:29.146
I wish I was different
back then.

27:32.884 --> 27:35.319
I wish, uh...

27:35.321 --> 27:38.989
I wish I could see the damage...

27:38.991 --> 27:41.358
That I was doing.

27:41.360 --> 27:44.294
To you and...

27:44.296 --> 27:47.831
And to mom and myself.
And, uh...

27:50.068 --> 27:51.835
I...

27:59.110 --> 28:03.213
I, uh, well, I...

28:03.215 --> 28:05.282
it took a long time
for me to realize it,

28:05.284 --> 28:10.187
and I want you to know
that I understand.

28:15.760 --> 28:17.327
And, uh...

28:18.830 --> 28:22.700
I'm...
I'm really, really sorry.

28:25.970 --> 28:27.237
For everything.

28:29.441 --> 28:33.343
I just want you to know that...

28:33.345 --> 28:37.881
That I know. That I know.

28:37.883 --> 28:39.450
All right?

28:42.754 --> 28:44.388
Yeah, all right.

28:50.261 --> 28:53.731
Hey, I was tearing apart
my closet the other day

28:53.733 --> 28:58.235
and I came across, uh...

28:58.237 --> 29:02.406
This game ball that I got from
the district championships.

29:02.408 --> 29:04.908
I don't know if you remember,
but I went 4 for 4.

29:04.910 --> 29:08.812
I can't remember if it was
the tigers or if it was...

29:08.814 --> 29:11.181
no, the reds.

29:11.183 --> 29:13.250
Had a hell of a year.

29:17.288 --> 29:20.991
Yeah, shit, the reds.
That's right.

29:20.993 --> 29:24.895
That was the game that Billy Dabrowski
tore his pants running for that foul ball.

29:24.897 --> 29:27.831
Yeah.

29:27.833 --> 29:29.867
That's right, yeah.

29:29.869 --> 29:31.802
And his legs
were stuck in the air

29:31.804 --> 29:33.370
and his bare ass was hanging
out, remember?

29:33.372 --> 29:35.806
Poor kid, I had to go pull
his pants up for him.

29:38.543 --> 29:40.410
Had everyone laughing.

29:43.281 --> 29:45.048
Oh, man.

29:46.284 --> 29:49.253
Oh, that was good times.
Right?

29:52.290 --> 29:54.491
Yeah, I remember.

29:54.493 --> 29:56.560
Yeah, me, too.
Me, too.

30:03.034 --> 30:06.170
All right. Well, hey,

30:06.172 --> 30:08.372
I got some stuff to do.
I just wanted...

30:11.943 --> 30:14.011
I just wanted
to give you a call.

30:17.315 --> 30:20.184
So I'll let you go back
to the game and...

30:22.554 --> 30:25.389
Maybe sometime I'll swing
by the bar, you know,

30:25.391 --> 30:26.924
if that's okay.

30:26.926 --> 30:29.193
Say hello, you know?

30:30.962 --> 30:33.463
Yeah, that'd be good.

30:33.465 --> 30:35.232
All right.

30:36.935 --> 30:39.336
Good.
I'll talk to you soon then.

30:39.338 --> 30:42.039
You, too.

30:42.041 --> 30:44.374
All right.

30:44.376 --> 30:45.976
Bye, dad.

30:48.213 --> 30:50.214
Good-bye, son.

31:28.920 --> 31:32.289
Hi. Can you put me through to
the D.A.'s office please?

31:34.359 --> 31:37.060
Yeah, just tell 'em it's
sergeant Pierce's son frank.

31:42.066 --> 31:43.567
Morning, baby.

31:46.938 --> 31:48.605
Afternoon.

32:04.489 --> 32:06.290
Where did you go last night?

32:08.126 --> 32:11.194
I just saw
a couple of old friends.

32:11.196 --> 32:14.398
Do we have any aspirin anywhere?

32:14.400 --> 32:16.500
I don't know.
Don't change the subject.

32:16.502 --> 32:18.969
I'm not changing the subject.

32:20.972 --> 32:23.640
You got in awfully late.

32:23.642 --> 32:25.709
I know.

32:27.211 --> 32:29.012
I just figured you were
sleeping, g, that's all.

32:29.014 --> 32:31.615
- No, I wasn't sleeping.
- All right.

32:31.617 --> 32:33.717
I was up all night
wondering where you were.

32:33.719 --> 32:36.119
- All right.
- So where did you go?

32:36.121 --> 32:38.722
I just...

32:38.724 --> 32:41.425
I just went out, that's all.

32:41.427 --> 32:43.627
Okay. Went out where?

32:45.964 --> 32:49.232
- Frank, where?
- All right, babe, huh? Please.

32:52.337 --> 32:54.137
Are you kidding me?

32:54.139 --> 32:56.640
You're out till
all hours of the night

32:56.642 --> 33:00.277
- and you won't even tell me...
- shut up! Shut up!

33:11.489 --> 33:13.256
Sorry.

33:15.660 --> 33:17.427
I'm sorry.

33:20.698 --> 33:22.466
G.

33:28.139 --> 33:32.342
Hey, I'm taking your car in later for
those ball joints. Don't forget.

33:35.747 --> 33:37.514
Fuck.

33:59.571 --> 34:01.204
Come on, Fritz.

34:02.774 --> 34:04.541
Come on, Fritz.

34:06.244 --> 34:07.644
Come on, Fritz.

34:07.646 --> 34:13.216
Come on, come on, come on,
come on.

34:13.217 --> 34:15.284
Okay.

34:20.558 --> 34:24.460
Yo. How's it going?

34:24.463 --> 34:26.228
Hey, Joe.

34:33.271 --> 34:35.338
How's Gina doing?

34:37.809 --> 34:40.577
Why?

34:40.579 --> 34:41.777
Just asking.

34:41.780 --> 34:44.147
She's fine.

34:44.149 --> 34:45.715
All right.

34:47.585 --> 34:49.085
You believe this shit?

34:49.088 --> 34:51.554
Fucking Fritz in
the fourth fucked me.

34:53.424 --> 34:55.492
You want a beer?

34:59.197 --> 35:00.764
Never mind.

35:04.268 --> 35:07.337
- You good?
- Why'd you do that for?

35:09.407 --> 35:12.509
Ah, sorry. I forgot.

35:12.511 --> 35:14.277
Sorry.

35:16.347 --> 35:19.216
You know what was going down
last night?

35:19.218 --> 35:20.650
Of course not.

35:20.652 --> 35:22.519
Why the fuck would I put myself
in that situation?

35:22.521 --> 35:24.321
You think I'm fucking retarded?

35:29.694 --> 35:32.629
Are you good? I mean, shit, I'm
freaking out a little bit here.

35:36.734 --> 35:38.802
Look, I can't sit on that.

35:40.805 --> 35:42.639
Yeah, right.

35:42.641 --> 35:44.374
I'm sorry I can't.

35:44.376 --> 35:46.376
- Frank, be serious.
- Look, I am serious.

35:46.378 --> 35:47.744
I talked to the D.A.

35:47.746 --> 35:51.181
And I'm going
to the precinct tomorrow.

35:51.183 --> 35:52.749
Frank, you kidding me? Do you
know who we're dealing with here?

35:52.751 --> 35:54.684
I mean, don't be stupid.

35:54.686 --> 35:56.920
I do know who we're dealing with
and I don't give a fuck.

35:56.922 --> 36:01.658
I gotta think of me and
my wife, and that's it.

36:01.660 --> 36:03.493
Come on, frank,
this is me we're talking about.

36:03.495 --> 36:04.828
Yeah, I know it's you.
It's always about you.

36:04.830 --> 36:08.231
That's how I got sucked into it.

36:08.233 --> 36:12.569
I told you don't bring me into
that stupid shit. I told you.

36:12.571 --> 36:14.437
So that's it.
I'm just fucked.

36:14.439 --> 36:15.939
You're just gonna rat me out
to the fucking D.A.'s office.

36:15.941 --> 36:17.607
I'm not ratting you out.
I'll keep your name out of it.

36:17.609 --> 36:20.610
I'm just letting you know
that's what's going on.

36:20.612 --> 36:23.613
Keep my name out of it.

36:23.615 --> 36:25.282
That's gonna look real good.
You know that, right?

36:25.284 --> 36:27.717
I mean, fuck, he's going to come
right out of prison,

36:27.719 --> 36:29.419
- give me a thank you card, and fucking blow my head off.
- Make it about you. Right.

36:29.421 --> 36:32.522
Look, it's done.
That's it.

36:32.524 --> 36:34.591
I told you I'll keep your name out of it.
I'll keep you name out of it.

36:34.593 --> 36:37.227
And don't you ever fucking ask
me for anything else again.

36:37.229 --> 36:38.795
No problem.

36:46.537 --> 36:48.305
Fuck!

36:53.277 --> 36:54.344
Jesus fuck.

37:28.346 --> 37:31.748
I keep telling him we need to
have people over more often.

37:31.750 --> 37:33.650
I know.

37:33.652 --> 37:35.719
I honestly can't even remember

37:35.721 --> 37:37.520
the last time I used
this patio furniture.

37:37.522 --> 37:39.489
It's so nice
to just sit out here.

37:39.491 --> 37:40.790
We should have this more often.

37:40.792 --> 37:42.726
You should get the guys together

37:42.728 --> 37:44.027
and you guys can all come by.

37:44.029 --> 37:45.595
- I know.
- You really should.

37:45.597 --> 37:47.397
Yeah.
It would be really great.

37:47.399 --> 37:49.833
Oh, frank.
There he is.

37:49.835 --> 37:52.836
There he is. Frankie.

37:52.838 --> 37:55.272
Niko.
Wow, wasn't expecting you.

37:55.274 --> 37:57.774
- I was in the neighborhood.
- Oh, yeah?

37:57.776 --> 38:00.010
Niko says that you guys
are old friends?

38:00.012 --> 38:01.878
Yeah, we know a lot
of the same people.

38:01.880 --> 38:05.382
A couple of guys
from back in the day, yeah.

38:05.384 --> 38:09.619
Well, on that note,
I am late to meet a friend,

38:09.621 --> 38:12.656
so I am going to head in,
get ready.

38:12.658 --> 38:14.057
I'll see you guys later.

38:14.059 --> 38:16.059
Can I get you a refresh?

38:16.061 --> 38:17.961
If I didn't know any better,
frank,

38:17.963 --> 38:19.429
I'd think your girl
was trying to get me drunk.

38:19.431 --> 38:22.032
Yeah. Off iced tea.

38:22.034 --> 38:24.401
Look, is that a yes?
A no? What?

38:24.403 --> 38:25.702
Nah, I should be going.

38:25.704 --> 38:27.771
Yeah. We're good.

38:40.985 --> 38:45.021
She looks better going
than coming.

38:45.023 --> 38:47.457
You know, the way
Mickey was talking,

38:47.459 --> 38:49.926
I thought you were some sort
of monster or something,

38:49.928 --> 38:52.595
like fucking Charlize Theron.

38:52.597 --> 38:56.800
But look at this. Nice house.
Nice woman.

38:56.802 --> 38:59.069
You're not a big tough guy.

38:59.071 --> 39:01.338
You're a fucking pussy.

39:03.607 --> 39:05.375
What the fuck do you want?

39:05.377 --> 39:08.345
I'm making sure you're not doing
something fucking stupid.

39:08.347 --> 39:12.082
Like you coming here,
motherfucker?

39:12.084 --> 39:14.417
Mick heard you made
a phone call.

39:14.419 --> 39:15.919
That right?

39:15.921 --> 39:17.787
Is that what he heard?

39:17.789 --> 39:19.122
Yeah.

39:19.124 --> 39:21.591
I don't know what
you're talking about.

39:21.593 --> 39:23.727
Yeah, sure you don't.

39:23.729 --> 39:26.396
You know, it's best you forget
some things, Frankie.

39:26.398 --> 39:28.031
Like Mick forgot some things
about you, too.

39:28.033 --> 39:30.400
Get your fucking hand
out of my face.

39:33.738 --> 39:35.872
Hey, frank.

39:35.874 --> 39:37.774
- Yeah?
- Do me a favor.

39:37.776 --> 39:39.476
Can you bring in
the mail please?

39:39.478 --> 39:42.645
Yeah, don't forget
the fucking mail, frank.

39:56.527 --> 39:59.796
- Frank, where are my car keys?
- Where are you going?

39:59.798 --> 40:02.932
I told you I'm going to Veronica's.
I'm already late.

40:02.934 --> 40:04.934
Do me a favor, baby.

40:04.936 --> 40:08.471
Don't let strangers
in the backyard anymore, okay?

40:08.473 --> 40:10.073
What are you talking about?
He's a friend of yours.

40:10.075 --> 40:12.876
He's not a... any random guy
says he's a friend of mine,

40:12.878 --> 40:14.677
you're gonna let him
in the backyard?

40:14.679 --> 40:16.112
You gonna cook him dinner, too?
You gonna let him in the house?

40:16.114 --> 40:18.848
Okay. Christ.
I get it.

40:18.850 --> 40:20.150
Do you?

40:20.152 --> 40:22.452
Yes.
What is with you?

40:22.454 --> 40:23.987
I don't like him.

40:23.989 --> 40:26.956
I barely know him, and I just...

40:26.958 --> 40:28.625
Please just don't anymore.
All right?

40:28.627 --> 40:30.794
All right. I mean, he seemed
like a nice enough guy.

40:30.796 --> 40:31.995
It doesn't matter.

40:31.997 --> 40:33.830
I just said don't do it
any more, okay?

40:33.832 --> 40:35.165
We were out there for a couple
of minutes before you got home.

40:35.167 --> 40:37.000
Just get your head
out of your ass, Gina,

40:37.002 --> 40:38.868
and don't fucking do it any more
and if you ever see him again,

40:38.870 --> 40:40.804
just walk the other way, please.

40:40.806 --> 40:42.105
Don't talk to me like that.

40:42.107 --> 40:44.441
Gina, did you hear
what I said? Yes or no?

40:44.443 --> 40:46.476
- Yes, I heard you.
- Did you hear what I said?

40:46.478 --> 40:48.077
Did you hear what I said?
Huh?

40:48.079 --> 40:50.146
Don't fucking do it anymore.

40:59.723 --> 41:01.491
What?

41:05.796 --> 41:07.230
Where are my keys?

41:10.501 --> 41:13.002
Where are my keys?

41:13.004 --> 41:15.071
I'm sorry. Look.

41:16.607 --> 41:18.508
Fuck. Baby.

41:18.510 --> 41:20.176
I took your car into the shop
before, okay?

41:20.178 --> 41:21.778
- Then I'm taking your truck.
- Listen, listen.

41:21.780 --> 41:23.546
- I'm taking your truck.
- I'm sorry.

41:23.548 --> 41:25.715
- Give them to me now.
- Gina.

41:25.717 --> 41:28.117
Frank, I'm not doing this.
I'm not doing this again.

41:28.119 --> 41:29.819
You blow a frigging gasket
yesterday

41:29.821 --> 41:31.521
and now you put
your hands on me?

41:31.523 --> 41:33.656
Give me your fucking keys
so I can go. Now.

41:33.658 --> 41:35.725
- Honey, just...
- now.

41:38.896 --> 41:40.563
G.

41:40.565 --> 41:42.999
Gina.

41:43.001 --> 41:46.736
I'm really sorry, baby.
Can I...

41:46.738 --> 41:48.505
fuck.

41:50.241 --> 41:52.008
Fuck!

42:06.624 --> 42:08.191
Shit.

42:19.937 --> 42:21.304
You look classy in a pickup.

42:21.306 --> 42:23.773
What happened to your car?

42:23.775 --> 42:26.242
It's in the shop, so I have his.

42:26.244 --> 42:28.645
Don't start.

42:28.647 --> 42:30.780
- Can we take yours?
- Yeah. Sure.

42:30.782 --> 42:32.048
- Is it open?
- Yeah. Go ahead.

42:32.050 --> 42:34.183
I'll throw my stuff inside.

42:37.923 --> 42:40.223
Let me guess.
Mr. personality?

42:40.225 --> 42:41.958
Yeah.

42:41.960 --> 42:43.760
Give me a second, all right?

42:43.762 --> 42:45.328
All right.

42:48.599 --> 42:50.099
Hello?

42:50.101 --> 42:51.935
Why do you always
say hello like that

42:51.937 --> 42:53.770
when you're pissed at me?

42:57.675 --> 42:59.609
Look, I just got here,
so I gotta go, all right?

42:59.611 --> 43:03.346
Wait, wait, wait.
Listen, listen.

43:03.348 --> 43:05.114
Baby, I'm so sorry.

43:06.717 --> 43:08.117
I'm so sorry.

43:08.119 --> 43:09.652
I don't know what the hell
got into me there.

43:09.654 --> 43:10.753
You didn't deserve that.

43:13.757 --> 43:16.192
No, I didn't.

43:16.194 --> 43:17.961
Look, uh...

43:19.763 --> 43:21.331
Let's talk.

43:22.666 --> 43:23.967
Tonight, okay?

43:23.969 --> 43:25.902
I love you so much.

43:30.708 --> 43:33.643
I'm just really sorry,
and I'll never do that again.

43:36.013 --> 43:38.081
I'll take you out to dinner.

43:39.350 --> 43:41.117
My treat.

43:42.386 --> 43:44.153
Please.

43:46.223 --> 43:51.628
Maybe we'll get a little
ice cream or something.

43:51.630 --> 43:52.895
Okay.

43:52.897 --> 43:54.964
All right, I love you, too.

43:54.966 --> 43:57.333
Hey, handsome.
Can I help you with something?

43:57.335 --> 43:58.635
Hey, yourself.
I'm just here to see Gina.

43:58.637 --> 43:59.836
Hey, hold on one second.
Hold on.

43:59.838 --> 44:01.337
- What's that?
- Hey, stranger.

44:01.339 --> 44:04.007
- Long time no see.
- Gina, who's that?

44:05.844 --> 44:08.911
- G. Gina, who's...
- hey, babe, hold on.

44:10.814 --> 44:13.249
Gina, who is that?

44:13.251 --> 44:14.784
- Hey.
- What's going on?

44:14.786 --> 44:16.886
Hey, babe, hold on.
It's your friend.

44:16.888 --> 44:19.122
What friend, Gina?

44:19.124 --> 44:21.124
- Gina, what friend?
- I was driving by.

44:21.126 --> 44:25.061
Saw that pretty face. Thought
I'd stop by for a second.

44:25.063 --> 44:27.864
Gina!

44:27.866 --> 44:30.967
Sorry. Veronica.
This is my friend Veronica.

44:30.969 --> 44:33.002
- Gina, what friend?
- This is frank's friend

44:33.004 --> 44:34.737
from back in the day.
Niko, right?

44:34.739 --> 44:36.105
- Yeah. Niko. Hey.
- Yeah.

44:36.107 --> 44:37.407
- Gina.
- Nice to meet you, Niko.

44:37.409 --> 44:39.409
Gina!

44:39.411 --> 44:42.979
Niko, do you know
frank's friend Travis, too?

44:42.981 --> 44:45.248
Yeah, Travis, yeah.
He's a good guy.

44:45.250 --> 44:48.017
Yeah, he is.
He's great.

44:48.019 --> 44:49.018
Anyway, I don't want to
interrupt your call.

44:49.020 --> 44:51.754
Shit, sorry. Frank.

44:51.756 --> 44:53.322
Frank. Babe.

44:54.825 --> 44:56.325
Are you still there?

44:56.327 --> 44:58.294
G.

44:58.296 --> 45:00.063
Gina!

45:01.398 --> 45:03.166
Gina!

45:11.408 --> 45:13.843
Babe?

45:13.845 --> 45:16.012
Shit, I lost him. Whatever.
I'll call him back later.

45:16.014 --> 45:17.480
Yeah, the reception is
a bitch around here.

45:17.482 --> 45:18.981
Yeah, it sucks.

45:18.983 --> 45:20.483
Same thing happens
to my fucking phone.

45:20.485 --> 45:22.719
It's crazy.

45:22.721 --> 45:24.787
Anyway,
I'm sorry to hit and run.

45:26.490 --> 45:28.758
Jesus Christ!

45:53.884 --> 45:55.952
Gina!

45:58.222 --> 45:59.989
Gina!

46:01.391 --> 46:03.793
Hey, hey, hey.

46:03.795 --> 46:06.062
Jesus Christ. V!

46:06.064 --> 46:07.296
Hey, hey. Wake up.
Wake up.

46:07.298 --> 46:09.132
Hey, wake up.
Wake up, wake up.

46:09.134 --> 46:11.334
Hey! Wait, wait, wait.

46:11.336 --> 46:14.070
Stop, stop, stop.
Where's Gina?

46:14.072 --> 46:17.473
Where is Gina? Where is Gina?
Where is she?

46:17.475 --> 46:19.175
- I don't know.
- Where is she?

46:19.177 --> 46:20.810
- Your friend.
- Who?

46:20.812 --> 46:22.378
Niko.

46:33.824 --> 46:35.992
- What's going on?
- -Who'd you fucking talk to?

46:35.994 --> 46:37.527
- What? Nobody.
- Who'd you fucking talk to?

46:37.529 --> 46:39.028
I didn't talk to anybody.
I didn't talk to anybody!

46:39.030 --> 46:40.163
Who'd you talk to?
Niko just took Gina.

46:40.165 --> 46:41.931
- What?
- Who did you talk to?

46:41.933 --> 46:44.200
- I didn't...
- who did you fucking talk to?

46:44.202 --> 46:45.568
- I didn't talk to anybody.
- Who did you talk to?

46:45.570 --> 46:47.303
How could they possibly
know, Travis?

46:47.305 --> 46:48.971
Dude, he's got half the force
in his fucking pocket.

46:48.973 --> 46:50.973
You don't think he's got
the D.A.'s office either?

46:50.975 --> 46:52.542
Ah, shit.

46:52.544 --> 46:54.977
- Yeah, shit.
- Shit.

46:54.979 --> 46:56.479
Listen,
I'm gonna make some calls.

46:56.481 --> 47:00.550
Where are you gonna be?
Frank, where are you gonna be?

47:00.552 --> 47:02.485
I don't know.

47:02.487 --> 47:04.554
I'm gonna talk to Charlie.

47:06.557 --> 47:08.057
All right.

47:08.059 --> 47:09.826
Meet you there.

47:17.367 --> 47:19.569
Hey, dad. Dad.

47:19.571 --> 47:21.370
Hey, twice in one week.
I must've hit the lottery.

47:21.372 --> 47:24.574
Dad, listen.
Something bad happened.

47:24.576 --> 47:26.409
What happened?

47:26.411 --> 47:28.110
I promise I didn't do anything.

47:28.112 --> 47:29.312
I didn't do anything wrong,
okay?

47:29.314 --> 47:30.847
Okay. What happened?
Tell me.

47:30.849 --> 47:32.481
I saw something
that I shouldn't have seen.

47:32.483 --> 47:34.584
And I tried doing
the right thing. I tried.

47:34.586 --> 47:36.152
I really did, dad,
I tried making it better

47:36.154 --> 47:41.023
and it made it worse.
Okay? And I... look...

47:41.025 --> 47:42.258
tell me. Tell me.
Just tell me, frank.

47:42.260 --> 47:44.327
I didn't want to tell you.

47:46.196 --> 47:50.266
I saw Mickey the other night.

47:50.268 --> 47:51.868
Ah, fuck. I should've known.
I should've known!

47:51.870 --> 47:53.970
No, no, no! Wait!
Please just listen to me.

47:53.972 --> 47:58.007
Please. I haven't seen him
in years, okay? I haven't.

47:58.009 --> 48:02.078
And some shit went down the other
night I had no part in. Honest.

48:02.080 --> 48:06.549
And he fucking, to keep me quiet,
he just kidnapped my wife.

48:06.551 --> 48:09.285
Un-fucking-believable. I thought
you were doing so good.

48:09.287 --> 48:11.621
After everything I've done to help you,
you're still hanging out with that scumbag?

48:11.623 --> 48:13.389
I'm not hanging out with him. I
just told you that. I'm not.

48:13.391 --> 48:15.124
- Keep it down over there.
- I'm not working with him.

48:15.126 --> 48:16.592
I haven't seen him.
Nothing.

48:16.594 --> 48:19.262
I just don't know what to do
right now. I need help.

48:19.264 --> 48:20.429
Frankie,
I don't know what to tell you.

48:20.431 --> 48:21.664
I got nothing else to give you.

48:21.666 --> 48:23.099
- Dad.
- I've done everything I can.

48:23.101 --> 48:24.166
- Dad, come on.
- Frankie.

48:24.168 --> 48:25.635
I don't know what to do.
Please.

48:25.637 --> 48:27.169
Some things you're gonna have to
figure out for yourself.

48:27.171 --> 48:28.471
What do you mean figure out
for myself?

48:28.473 --> 48:29.639
Didn't you hear
what I just fucking said?

48:29.641 --> 48:31.240
Didn't you hear
what I just said?

48:31.242 --> 48:33.175
Take it easy.
I'm not gonna tell you again.

48:33.177 --> 48:35.511
That's my wife
and I'm your fucking son.

48:35.513 --> 48:37.446
- Let go of my arm, Frankie.
- I'm your fucking son and you don't want to help me?

48:37.448 --> 48:39.482
I'm your fucking son!

48:41.286 --> 48:42.618
Frankie, stop!

48:42.620 --> 48:46.989
Let him go, Frankie!

48:46.991 --> 48:49.458
Stop!

49:23.126 --> 49:24.593
Frank.

49:24.595 --> 49:27.096
Jesus Christ,
what happened to you?

49:27.098 --> 49:28.731
- Are you all right?
- What are you doing here?

49:28.733 --> 49:31.367
What are you fucking doing here?
What are you doing here?

49:31.369 --> 49:33.069
Ow! Fucking frank, stop!

49:33.071 --> 49:34.403
Are you lying to me?
You owe Mickey money?

49:34.405 --> 49:36.105
- No!
- Are you holding out on me?

49:36.107 --> 49:37.273
Are you holding out on me?

49:37.275 --> 49:38.541
No, I'm not!
I'm not, I'm not!

49:38.543 --> 49:40.242
When was the last time
he called you?

49:40.244 --> 49:41.610
- Fuck, I don't know.
- Did he ever call you at all?

49:41.612 --> 49:43.379
No, he never... once,
but he has a burner.

49:43.381 --> 49:45.348
Don't you fucking lie to me,
Travis!

49:45.350 --> 49:47.516
He changes it every couple of days.
I'm not lying to you.

49:47.518 --> 49:49.518
- I'm not lying to you.
- What about that guy at the bar the other night?

49:49.520 --> 49:52.088
- The guy that knows everybody.
- Yeah. Fucking Donny. Donny.

49:52.090 --> 49:54.023
He can get to him, okay?
I just talked to him.

49:54.025 --> 49:55.624
He's at Bernie's.
I can take you there.

49:55.626 --> 49:57.326
You're gonna take me there right
fucking now, you understand?

49:57.328 --> 49:58.461
- Yeah.
- Don't you fucking lie to me!

49:58.463 --> 50:01.364
- Ow! Fuck!
- Go!

50:14.045 --> 50:15.611
You're an amazing singer.

50:15.613 --> 50:19.148
You should see me
sing rock ballads.

50:19.150 --> 50:22.318
Donny. Hey, Donny. Donny.
I need your help here.

50:22.320 --> 50:25.087
My friend frank over here, he's
kind of in a bad way, all right?

50:25.089 --> 50:26.322
Just don't fuck with him.
All right?

50:26.324 --> 50:27.690
Hey. Watch out.

50:27.692 --> 50:30.426
Hey, frank.
You look like you need a beer.

50:30.428 --> 50:33.029
- Where can I find Mickey?
- Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

50:33.031 --> 50:35.531
Slow your roll there, Tex.
This isn't the prom.

50:35.533 --> 50:37.767
Maybe you can buy me a drink

50:37.769 --> 50:38.768
and then you can get
into my pants.

50:38.770 --> 50:41.570
Maybe, if you buy me two,

50:41.572 --> 50:42.605
I'll let you get into her pants.

50:45.343 --> 50:47.276
Aah!

50:47.278 --> 50:49.578
What are you doing, man?
A fucking fork?

50:49.580 --> 50:51.781
I don't have time
for bullshit, okay?

50:51.783 --> 50:54.050
Listen to me.
Where is Mickey?

50:54.052 --> 50:56.085
I don't know where.

50:56.087 --> 50:58.421
I mean I don't know
where he is right now!

50:58.423 --> 51:00.423
- He may be at Cafe Azzuro.
- Where?

51:00.425 --> 51:03.392
Cafe Azzuro.
He'll be there every morning.

51:03.394 --> 51:06.796
He gets a cappuccino and he
likes it there. It's quiet.

51:06.798 --> 51:09.465
- It's like clockwork there.
- You got a number?

51:09.467 --> 51:13.169
Yeah, it's in my phone.
Listed under "asshole."

51:13.171 --> 51:15.738
Ahh! Stop! Stop, man!

51:15.740 --> 51:18.641
His name is "asshole"
in my phone!

51:18.643 --> 51:21.677
Ow. The number is in there.
It's the last one he used.

51:21.679 --> 51:23.679
Shut the fuck up and come here!
Shut up!

51:23.681 --> 51:25.848
What about his daughter crystal?

51:25.850 --> 51:28.417
Yeah, yeah. My brother's been hanging
out with her the past few weeks.

51:28.419 --> 51:31.153
She's been hanging out
at his club. Ow! Ow!

51:31.155 --> 51:33.422
She's there every night.
Works the back room.

51:33.424 --> 51:35.791
If you are lying to me...
if you're fucking lying...

51:35.793 --> 51:39.728
I'm not, man. Trust me. They're
gonna be there. I guarantee it.

51:39.730 --> 51:43.732
Ahh! Oh, fuck!

51:46.670 --> 51:48.704
Yo, frank. Why were you talking
about crystal back there?

51:48.706 --> 51:51.774
Go get a burner, and get to that alley
across the street from Azurro's.

51:51.776 --> 51:53.809
And get there in the morning
before he gets there.

51:53.811 --> 51:55.277
- Frank. Frank, wait.
- Just do it.

51:55.279 --> 51:56.545
- Don't fucking "wait" me.
- Okay.

51:56.547 --> 51:59.248
- All right?
- Okay.

51:59.250 --> 52:01.317
Keep your fucking phone on.

52:58.742 --> 53:02.344
What's up slut? Yeah?

53:14.457 --> 53:19.495
Yeah, you missed a great night.
So I hope he was worth it.

53:19.497 --> 53:23.532
No, he was wasted again.
I just can't deal with it.

53:23.534 --> 53:25.367
I'm on my way home.

53:25.369 --> 53:27.636
But you are coming out
tomorrow night,

53:27.638 --> 53:29.972
so wear something hot.

53:29.974 --> 53:32.474
We are going to visage.

53:34.411 --> 53:37.413
All right.
I'll call you manana.

54:07.777 --> 54:10.679
Oh, come on. Goddamn it!

56:41.564 --> 56:43.632
Ahh! Fucker!

58:18.128 --> 58:21.129
- Yo.
- Where the hell you been, man?

58:21.131 --> 58:24.833
Hey, I'm sorry. I've just been
making some fucking phone calls.

58:24.835 --> 58:28.070
I got a new friend.

58:28.072 --> 58:30.606
What are you talking about
a new friend?

58:30.608 --> 58:34.910
- I got crystal.
- You got crystal?

58:34.912 --> 58:38.146
Oh, he's gonna listen now.

58:38.148 --> 58:39.548
- Jesus Christ we need...
- where's Mickey?

58:39.550 --> 58:41.083
He's right where
Donny said he'd be.

58:41.085 --> 58:44.019
He's at the cafe.

58:44.021 --> 58:48.757
Hmm, that's funny cause he's not
picking up the phone, Trav.

58:50.660 --> 58:52.728
So, what do you wanna do?

58:52.730 --> 58:54.696
What's he doing right now?

58:56.599 --> 58:59.735
He's just talking to Niko.

59:02.138 --> 59:03.572
All right, get him that burner.

59:07.677 --> 59:09.545
Are you sure
you wanna do it this way?

59:09.547 --> 59:13.715
I mean... I mean, man, we could
just get out of this mess.

59:13.717 --> 59:15.984
We could just take her,
drop her off somewhere.

59:15.986 --> 59:19.054
She'll think she passed out. It wouldn't
be the first fucking time, right?

59:20.623 --> 59:24.693
Travis, I'm gonna text you
when she wakes up.

59:24.695 --> 59:27.763
Just get him
that fucking burner.

59:39.577 --> 59:41.610
Bobby.

59:41.612 --> 59:43.645
Is that you?

59:43.647 --> 59:45.080
Where are you?

59:58.161 --> 01:00:00.195
Come on.

01:00:00.197 --> 01:00:02.130
Untie me, Bobby.

01:00:11.741 --> 01:00:14.042
I'm not into this anymore.

01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:22.618
I told you no more hitting me.

01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:25.220
My head is fucking killing me.

01:00:34.097 --> 01:00:36.164
This isn't funny.

01:00:38.368 --> 01:00:41.670
I'm not in the mood for this.

01:00:41.672 --> 01:00:44.172
You're really starting
to creep me out.

01:00:49.278 --> 01:00:52.047
Bobby.

01:00:52.049 --> 01:00:54.816
Untie me. Now! Come on.

01:00:59.156 --> 01:01:00.856
I'm not Bobby.

01:01:08.264 --> 01:01:09.398
Shit!

01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:11.099
No!

01:01:15.805 --> 01:01:16.905
Shit!

01:01:19.977 --> 01:01:21.777
No!

01:01:21.779 --> 01:01:23.111
Fuck.

01:01:32.789 --> 01:01:36.692
He reached across the counter
and grabbed me...

01:01:37.894 --> 01:01:39.961
I bet he fucking talked though.

01:01:39.963 --> 01:01:43.799
I would've talked. My mama would've
talked in these conditions.

01:01:47.170 --> 01:01:50.272
Who's this guy?

01:01:50.274 --> 01:01:51.406
Where the fuck you going?

01:01:51.408 --> 01:01:52.974
Yo, some dude gave me $50

01:01:52.976 --> 01:01:53.975
to give this to your man
with the suit.

01:01:53.977 --> 01:01:55.811
What dude? What dude?

01:01:55.813 --> 01:01:58.080
I don't know.
Some dude over there.

01:01:58.082 --> 01:01:59.414
What the fuck are you doing?

01:01:59.416 --> 01:02:03.318
Yo, chill man.
It's just a fucking phone.

01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:06.421
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Let me out of here!

01:02:06.423 --> 01:02:08.790
Somebody!

01:02:08.792 --> 01:02:10.826
Let me out of here!

01:02:10.828 --> 01:02:12.327
Let me out!

01:02:12.329 --> 01:02:15.831
Please!
Let me out of here!

01:02:15.833 --> 01:02:18.166
Help!

01:02:18.168 --> 01:02:22.471
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

01:02:22.473 --> 01:02:24.506
Crystal.

01:02:24.508 --> 01:02:27.242
- Stop.
- Okay.

01:02:27.244 --> 01:02:29.845
Stop. Okay?

01:02:39.489 --> 01:02:43.191
Can you tell me
what you want with me?

01:02:43.193 --> 01:02:47.395
Right now I just need you
to keep your mouth shut.

01:02:47.397 --> 01:02:50.031
This must be
some kind of mistake.

01:02:55.304 --> 01:02:56.538
Relax.

01:03:00.277 --> 01:03:02.444
Are you Mickey Duro's daughter?

01:03:08.384 --> 01:03:09.518
Yeah.

01:03:11.387 --> 01:03:12.954
Then there's no mistake.

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:18.226
Relax.

01:03:24.066 --> 01:03:26.835
So here's what's gonna happen.

01:03:27.970 --> 01:03:30.405
I'm gonna call your old man,

01:03:30.407 --> 01:03:34.209
and I'm gonna let you talk to him for
about 5 seconds so he knows you're okay.

01:03:37.346 --> 01:03:39.581
Don't try anything, all right?

01:03:42.485 --> 01:03:44.252
All right?

01:03:59.135 --> 01:04:01.069
Yeah.

01:04:01.071 --> 01:04:02.871
Put Mickey on the phone.

01:04:02.873 --> 01:04:04.105
Who the fuck is this?

01:04:04.107 --> 01:04:06.174
Put Mickey on the fucking phone.

01:04:07.944 --> 01:04:09.344
Wants to talk to you.

01:04:11.047 --> 01:04:13.114
Yeah, who is it?

01:04:13.116 --> 01:04:14.850
You know who this is, Mick.

01:04:14.852 --> 01:04:17.419
Look, I don't have a clue
who this is.

01:04:17.421 --> 01:04:19.521
So just get to it, okay?
My Espresso's getting cold.

01:04:21.457 --> 01:04:23.225
You got something of mine, Mick.

01:04:23.227 --> 01:04:26.428
Look, I have a lot of things
that people want, okay?

01:04:26.430 --> 01:04:28.563
You're gonna have to be a bit
more specific there, dude.

01:04:28.565 --> 01:04:31.299
This something
doesn't belong to you.

01:04:31.301 --> 01:04:34.436
That's where you're mistaken.
Now listen to me.

01:04:34.438 --> 01:04:38.940
If I have it, it's mine.

01:04:38.942 --> 01:04:42.344
Pussy. Money. Dope. If it's
in my pocket, it's mine.

01:04:42.346 --> 01:04:45.080
If you can get it out of my pocket,
well, that's a different story,

01:04:45.082 --> 01:04:48.950
but right now,
that shit belongs to me.

01:04:48.952 --> 01:04:52.153
Well, if that's the case, then I
can say the same thing to you.

01:04:54.924 --> 01:04:55.991
Daddy?

01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:00.428
Crystal? Crystal?

01:05:00.430 --> 01:05:02.163
I don't know what the hell's
going on here, but... ahh!

01:05:02.165 --> 01:05:06.334
Crystal! What the fuck?
Hey, motherfucker!

01:05:06.336 --> 01:05:08.270
Do I have your attention
now, Mick?

01:05:08.272 --> 01:05:10.272
I'm gonna kill
every motherfucker you know!

01:05:10.274 --> 01:05:11.506
Every motherfucker you know!

01:05:11.508 --> 01:05:13.208
And let you live,
you cocksucker.

01:05:13.210 --> 01:05:16.177
Hey, Mickey.

01:05:16.179 --> 01:05:18.113
Now you're gonna listen to me.

01:05:21.284 --> 01:05:23.418
Just like the old times, right?

01:05:23.420 --> 01:05:25.954
Ahh! I'ma fu...

01:05:31.594 --> 01:05:33.361
sorry.

01:05:47.677 --> 01:05:51.012
He just slammed the burner
on the ground.

01:05:53.049 --> 01:05:56.051
Now he's bee-lining it
out of there.

01:05:56.053 --> 01:05:58.420
It's on now.

01:05:58.422 --> 01:06:01.489
Travis. Travis.

01:06:04.593 --> 01:06:06.361
Travis.

01:06:20.509 --> 01:06:22.277
Hey.

01:06:24.613 --> 01:06:26.147
Thirsty?

01:06:28.584 --> 01:06:32.420
Look, it's gonna be a long day.

01:06:32.422 --> 01:06:35.123
So just relax
a little bit, okay?

01:06:43.366 --> 01:06:45.333
I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:06:46.602 --> 01:06:49.604
I never was.
I just needed you.

01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:54.509
You all right?

01:06:54.511 --> 01:06:56.778
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm.

01:07:00.783 --> 01:07:02.550
Sorry.

01:07:18.634 --> 01:07:20.402
You want more?

01:07:29.111 --> 01:07:31.679
What does that mean?
Interpret that for me.

01:07:31.681 --> 01:07:33.648
Interpret that for me.

01:07:33.650 --> 01:07:35.350
No, no, no, no, no.

01:07:35.352 --> 01:07:38.219
It means, I wish I hadn't
been caught.

01:07:38.221 --> 01:07:42.724
Motherfucker. Hey! Calm the
fuck down and be thirsty!

01:07:44.493 --> 01:07:47.462
There you go, you motherfucker.

01:07:47.464 --> 01:07:50.532
Motherfucker.

01:07:55.571 --> 01:07:57.739
Now I thought you and I
had an understanding.

01:07:57.741 --> 01:07:59.574
You mixed up in this shit?

01:07:59.576 --> 01:08:02.210
Are you a part of this mess?

01:08:02.212 --> 01:08:04.379
You're not gonna waste
my time, are you?

01:08:04.381 --> 01:08:07.715
You're not gonna waste my time. No, you're
gonna tell me where they are, right?

01:08:07.717 --> 01:08:09.217
So where are frank and my daughter?
You know where he is?

01:08:09.219 --> 01:08:10.585
I don't know.

01:08:10.587 --> 01:08:12.220
No?

01:08:13.389 --> 01:08:14.589
No.

01:08:24.533 --> 01:08:26.301
How long have you known...

01:08:30.273 --> 01:08:33.608
Wow. How long you've known
frank, Travis?

01:08:33.609 --> 01:08:35.310
Huh?

01:08:35.312 --> 01:08:36.544
A few years.

01:08:36.546 --> 01:08:38.846
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:08:38.849 --> 01:08:41.116
Yeah.

01:08:41.118 --> 01:08:42.350
You know, frank and I
used to work together.

01:08:42.352 --> 01:08:44.786
- Did you know that?
- Good for you.

01:08:47.288 --> 01:08:49.124
Things were good
when we were together.

01:08:49.126 --> 01:08:51.126
He knew how to handle people
without any repercussions.

01:08:51.127 --> 01:08:52.627
He was like my kid, you know?

01:08:52.629 --> 01:08:54.895
But frank was born with a,
I don't know,

01:08:54.898 --> 01:08:56.430
a bad bone in him.

01:08:56.433 --> 01:08:59.466
He was just born bad, you know?

01:08:59.469 --> 01:09:00.702
Yeah, I fucking know.

01:09:00.703 --> 01:09:02.604
No, you don't.

01:09:02.606 --> 01:09:05.406
But you're gonna
find the fuck out.

01:09:05.408 --> 01:09:08.143
You don't know shit about him.

01:09:10.845 --> 01:09:13.448
He was a very bad seed

01:09:13.450 --> 01:09:14.916
long before I ever met him.

01:09:16.352 --> 01:09:18.185
Did you know he was
in the military?

01:09:18.188 --> 01:09:20.555
It was either that or prison.

01:09:20.557 --> 01:09:22.490
Aggravated assault.
Three-time loser.

01:09:22.492 --> 01:09:26.394
So he picked the marine corp.

01:09:26.395 --> 01:09:27.895
He was doing pretty good over
there, too, for a couple of years,

01:09:27.898 --> 01:09:30.331
but then he broke
some guy's jaw over in Japan.

01:09:30.332 --> 01:09:31.933
Broke his neck.

01:09:31.935 --> 01:09:33.600
By accident!

01:09:35.639 --> 01:09:37.639
By accident.

01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:40.408
Marines wouldn't do nothing for
him, so they locked him up.

01:09:40.410 --> 01:09:43.778
Parents had to fucking
remortgage their house

01:09:43.779 --> 01:09:45.479
just to get him enough money
to get him a lawyer.

01:09:45.482 --> 01:09:46.848
Why the fuck are you even
telling me this, Mick?

01:09:46.850 --> 01:09:49.417
What the fuck's it got
to do with me, huh?

01:09:55.458 --> 01:09:57.525
And he loves her.

01:09:59.296 --> 01:10:01.262
You got every right to cry.

01:10:01.264 --> 01:10:03.898
'Cause when I show him
this picture...

01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:05.833
hang on.
I like that.

01:10:05.835 --> 01:10:08.903
That's your cock
going in his wife's ass.

01:10:08.905 --> 01:10:10.371
When I show him this picture,

01:10:10.373 --> 01:10:11.806
you know what
he's gonna do to you?

01:10:11.808 --> 01:10:13.808
Imagine all the pain in mankind.

01:10:13.810 --> 01:10:16.578
He's gonna give it to you
as a gift and keep you alive

01:10:16.580 --> 01:10:19.647
to give it to you every day.

01:10:19.649 --> 01:10:23.484
Now, he ain't seen it yet.
He don't have to see it.

01:10:23.486 --> 01:10:26.387
So I'm your god
from this moment forward.

01:10:26.389 --> 01:10:29.290
You address me as god.
So say "thank you, god."

01:10:29.292 --> 01:10:30.525
I ain't sent it to him yet.

01:10:30.527 --> 01:10:32.760
Say "thank you, god."
Come on, say it.

01:10:32.762 --> 01:10:36.264
Say it, motherfucker!
Say it! Say it! Say it!

01:10:36.266 --> 01:10:38.800
- Thank you, god.
- Thank you, god! Say it!

01:10:38.802 --> 01:10:40.501
Motherfucker!
I'll kill your fucking ass!

01:10:40.503 --> 01:10:41.836
- Thank you, god.
- He's worked for me!

01:10:41.838 --> 01:10:44.239
I'll make you feel
like a fucking bitch!

01:10:44.241 --> 01:10:45.640
I'll kill you, you motherfucker!

01:10:45.642 --> 01:10:48.977
I'll kill you, motherfucker.
Come here.

01:10:48.979 --> 01:10:50.712
Get the fuck over here,
you fucking piece of shit.

01:10:50.714 --> 01:10:52.614
I'll kill you, you fucking
goddamn motherfucker.

01:10:52.616 --> 01:10:55.683
That's my fucking daughter,
you goddamn motherfucker!

01:10:55.685 --> 01:10:57.752
I'll kill you,
you son of a bitch.

01:10:57.754 --> 01:11:00.855
Look at me.

01:11:00.857 --> 01:11:03.691
Now say "thank you, god!"

01:11:03.693 --> 01:11:06.461
You're with a fucking goddamn
psychopath right now!

01:11:06.463 --> 01:11:08.796
You're with me now!
You ain't over there!

01:11:08.798 --> 01:11:12.967
You ain't in high school!

01:11:12.969 --> 01:11:15.870
I gotta relax or I'll kill you by accident.
I gotta keep you alive.

01:11:15.872 --> 01:11:17.872
I need you to find
my daughter, okay?

01:11:17.874 --> 01:11:19.641
Okay? Say "thank you, god." Say it.
Say it.

01:11:19.643 --> 01:11:22.343
Thank you, god. Thank you, god.
Thank you, god.

01:11:22.345 --> 01:11:24.812
Now we're getting somewhere.
You know his dad?

01:11:24.814 --> 01:11:27.548
His dad was a cop for a long time.
Sergeant Pierce, you know him?

01:11:27.550 --> 01:11:29.550
- Yeah.
- Sergeant Pierce, you know him?

01:11:29.552 --> 01:11:31.519
- Kind of, yeah.
- Kind of.

01:11:31.521 --> 01:11:33.588
Just relax, all right?

01:11:35.324 --> 01:11:37.492
Apple don't fall too far from
the tree, you know?

01:11:37.494 --> 01:11:40.795
His father wrote the book
on police brutality.

01:11:40.797 --> 01:11:43.364
So they scraped together every
dime they had, his family did,

01:11:43.366 --> 01:11:45.600
and they paid off
the right people

01:11:45.602 --> 01:11:47.669
and he was home in a year.

01:11:47.671 --> 01:11:49.537
There was a big fucking party.

01:11:49.539 --> 01:11:51.973
Frank comes home and he broke
some fucking guy's eye socket

01:11:51.975 --> 01:11:55.310
who said some smart-ass shit
about him happened over there.

01:11:55.312 --> 01:11:57.578
But he got lucky.
It was self-defense.

01:11:57.580 --> 01:11:59.047
The guy threw the first punch.

01:11:59.049 --> 01:12:01.316
You get it? Okay?

01:12:02.652 --> 01:12:04.919
I fear him.

01:12:04.921 --> 01:12:08.523
Now, when I show him this...

01:12:11.827 --> 01:12:14.495
You will wish
you never were born.

01:12:14.497 --> 01:12:16.931
He is gonna give you something

01:12:16.933 --> 01:12:20.001
no one has ever
fucking known about.

01:12:20.003 --> 01:12:22.003
- And he ain't gonna
let you die.

01:12:22.005 --> 01:12:24.372
Okay, he's gonna cut off your arms,
your legs, your fucking eyes,

01:12:24.374 --> 01:12:25.473
pull your fucking arms off,
your dick,

01:12:25.475 --> 01:12:26.674
and then put you in the corner,

01:12:26.676 --> 01:12:27.975
but keep your brain intact,
though.

01:12:27.977 --> 01:12:29.077
Put you in the corner like
a fucking plant

01:12:29.079 --> 01:12:31.979
and piss on you, you get it?

01:12:31.981 --> 01:12:34.916
He thought that up.

01:12:34.918 --> 01:12:36.551
But look at me.

01:12:36.553 --> 01:12:37.919
I was his boss!

01:12:37.921 --> 01:12:39.854
You motherfucker!
Where is he?

01:12:39.856 --> 01:12:41.389
I'll kill you, motherfucker!

01:12:41.391 --> 01:12:42.557
I'll kill you!

01:12:44.427 --> 01:12:46.794
I don't know.

01:12:46.796 --> 01:12:49.697
- I don't know.
- I'll eat you.

01:12:49.699 --> 01:12:52.600
Okay? He worked for me!

01:12:52.602 --> 01:12:55.136
I'll eat you.

01:12:55.138 --> 01:12:56.804
Now you look at me,
motherfucker.

01:12:56.806 --> 01:12:58.106
I'm gonna ask you one time.

01:12:58.108 --> 01:13:00.808
You're in fucking hell,
you fucker!

01:13:00.810 --> 01:13:02.710
Something happens to my
daughter, you motherfucker...

01:13:02.712 --> 01:13:04.512
now you listen to me.

01:13:04.514 --> 01:13:06.581
You answer this question!
Where is he?

01:13:06.583 --> 01:13:09.150
- I don't know.
- Okay, I believe you.

01:13:09.152 --> 01:13:10.818
I believe you.

01:13:10.820 --> 01:13:12.653
- I believe you.
- I don't know.

01:13:12.655 --> 01:13:14.489
I believe you.
Shut up. Shut up.

01:13:14.491 --> 01:13:16.924
Shut the fuck up, motherfucker,
or I'll fucking kill you.

01:13:16.926 --> 01:13:18.126
I believe you. Now you're
gonna work with me, though.

01:13:18.128 --> 01:13:20.128
We gotta find my daughter.
Okay?

01:13:23.733 --> 01:13:25.633
I don't like doing this shit,
you know?

01:13:25.635 --> 01:13:28.035
I'd rather get my cock sucked.
You wanna suck my cock?

01:13:28.037 --> 01:13:30.071
Huh? You want to?

01:13:33.008 --> 01:13:34.575
Travis, pull yourself together.

01:13:34.577 --> 01:13:36.844
Frank only calms down
when he drinks.

01:13:36.846 --> 01:13:38.846
Now is he drinking?
Is he getting high?

01:13:38.848 --> 01:13:41.482
- Okay. We don't know
nothing then.

01:13:43.652 --> 01:13:46.621
What am I gonna do with you?
Huh?

01:13:46.623 --> 01:13:48.689
You gonna help me find him?

01:13:57.966 --> 01:13:59.734
Thanks.

01:14:01.103 --> 01:14:03.037
You're welcome.

01:14:08.877 --> 01:14:10.945
You used to hang around
with my dad a lot.

01:14:13.716 --> 01:14:16.451
I had a crush on you
when I was a kid.

01:14:16.453 --> 01:14:17.885
Did you know that?

01:14:17.887 --> 01:14:20.888
You did?

01:14:20.890 --> 01:14:23.191
Come on.

01:14:23.193 --> 01:14:24.959
Yeah, I remember you.

01:14:28.230 --> 01:14:29.897
So you're not gonna hurt me.

01:14:29.899 --> 01:14:31.666
No.

01:14:32.935 --> 01:14:34.035
No.

01:14:37.873 --> 01:14:39.640
Are you gonna hurt my dad?

01:14:47.816 --> 01:14:49.050
Yeah.

01:14:59.561 --> 01:15:01.262
You don't know your dad
too well, do you?

01:15:10.906 --> 01:15:13.708
Your dad and me
used to be real close,

01:15:13.710 --> 01:15:15.776
- well, you know.
- Yeah.

01:15:15.778 --> 01:15:18.212
When we used to work together.

01:15:18.214 --> 01:15:20.281
You were at the, uh...

01:15:20.283 --> 01:15:22.550
Trucking company.

01:15:25.521 --> 01:15:26.821
Yeah.

01:15:28.090 --> 01:15:29.857
Yeah.

01:16:18.073 --> 01:16:20.841
Your mom one time was, uh...

01:16:22.177 --> 01:16:26.280
Outside the house
when I came home early,

01:16:26.282 --> 01:16:30.318
and I actually got your mom

01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:32.019
to smoke weed with me.

01:16:32.021 --> 01:16:35.289
Shut up.

01:16:35.291 --> 01:16:36.958
Never would've thought that,
huh?

01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:38.693
- I don't know.
- Mm-hmm.

01:16:38.695 --> 01:16:41.228
No. She's never seen
that side of me.

01:16:41.230 --> 01:16:44.131
Yeah, I got your mom high.

01:16:44.133 --> 01:16:46.300
Yeah, is that all you did?

01:16:46.302 --> 01:16:48.836
- Yes.
- Mm.

01:16:48.838 --> 01:16:50.972
- You better.
- Stop.

01:16:50.974 --> 01:16:53.674
She was great.
A good woman.

01:16:55.344 --> 01:16:58.145
- Yes.
- She was good to me.

01:16:58.147 --> 01:17:03.684
And she's the reason actually
why I got that firebird.

01:17:03.686 --> 01:17:05.319
- Do you remember that car?
- Oh, my god.

01:17:05.321 --> 01:17:07.321
- Yeah, that was your mom.
- Yes, yes.

01:17:07.323 --> 01:17:10.224
We were driving by a dealership one
day, me, her, and your father,

01:17:10.226 --> 01:17:12.393
and it just caught my eye.

01:17:12.395 --> 01:17:14.996
I was like,
"that car is beautiful."

01:17:14.998 --> 01:17:17.098
- It was a beautiful car.
- Yeah.

01:17:17.100 --> 01:17:19.033
She convinced your dad
to pick it up for me

01:17:19.035 --> 01:17:23.170
for Christmas one year.

01:17:23.172 --> 01:17:26.807
I, uh, I used to sit in it

01:17:26.809 --> 01:17:28.209
when you used to come over
to the house.

01:17:28.211 --> 01:17:29.977
- Did you really?
- Yes.

01:17:29.979 --> 01:17:32.113
- You little runt.
- It had the cool t-tops.

01:17:32.115 --> 01:17:35.750
- The t-tops.
- Yeah.

01:17:37.253 --> 01:17:41.088
Yeah, I thought I was awesome.

01:17:41.090 --> 01:17:43.791
You were awesome.
You were a fun little kid.

01:17:47.162 --> 01:17:48.929
I remember.

01:17:52.401 --> 01:17:54.168
I remember.

01:17:55.871 --> 01:18:00.441
And I remember my dad.

01:18:00.443 --> 01:18:04.245
He, uh, he really cared
about you.

01:18:04.247 --> 01:18:05.913
Hmm.

01:18:07.182 --> 01:18:11.285
And then, well, you just

01:18:11.287 --> 01:18:13.421
stopped coming around.

01:18:13.423 --> 01:18:15.456
Yeah, I did.

01:18:15.458 --> 01:18:17.224
That sucked.

01:18:22.864 --> 01:18:24.899
Your father was, uh...

01:18:28.970 --> 01:18:32.840
- He was a user.
- Mm.

01:18:32.842 --> 01:18:34.408
I trusted him.

01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:42.983
I lost two years of my life...

01:18:42.985 --> 01:18:47.188
For your dad because
I kept my mouth shut.

01:18:52.427 --> 01:18:55.763
And I lost my family
and I lost everything

01:18:55.765 --> 01:18:57.331
because of him.

01:19:01.937 --> 01:19:04.004
And what happened
when you got out?

01:19:07.943 --> 01:19:09.877
I met my wife at AA.

01:19:16.485 --> 01:19:18.352
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:19:27.329 --> 01:19:30.297
My dad took her, didn't he?

01:19:35.871 --> 01:19:37.505
Yeah.

01:19:37.507 --> 01:19:39.273
Why?

01:19:44.279 --> 01:19:45.880
Why are you trying
to make me mad for?

01:19:45.882 --> 01:19:47.448
Why are you trying
to wind me up?

01:19:47.450 --> 01:19:49.416
I wanna know.

01:19:49.418 --> 01:19:51.185
'Cause he's scared.

01:19:54.823 --> 01:19:57.892
Is that why you took me?

01:20:03.799 --> 01:20:04.932
Hmm?

01:20:04.934 --> 01:20:09.103
- Maybe.
- Maybe?

01:20:09.105 --> 01:20:11.539
Well,

01:20:11.541 --> 01:20:13.073
I'm kind of glad you did.

01:20:13.075 --> 01:20:14.308
Are you?

01:20:14.310 --> 01:20:16.577
Mm-hmm.

01:20:16.579 --> 01:20:20.347
So... Now what?

01:20:28.356 --> 01:20:31.592
- Hmm.
- Hmm?

01:20:31.594 --> 01:20:35.830
Now, I'm gonna finish
this bottle with you.

01:20:35.832 --> 01:20:38.499
Mm-hmm. Oh.

01:21:14.202 --> 01:21:17.171
Fuck.

01:21:17.173 --> 01:21:19.940
Clean yourself up
with that towel there.

01:21:19.942 --> 01:21:21.942
Hang on.

01:21:27.616 --> 01:21:31.151
Un-fucking-believable.
Niko!

01:21:31.153 --> 01:21:33.621
Fucking bald headed prick.

01:21:33.623 --> 01:21:35.623
You want a drink? Huh?

01:21:35.625 --> 01:21:36.891
Yeah.

01:21:43.098 --> 01:21:45.199
Gina.

01:21:45.201 --> 01:21:48.035
I was pretty sure you didn't know
who frank was. Do think she does?

01:21:48.037 --> 01:21:49.637
What do you think?

01:21:49.639 --> 01:21:51.472
You think she does?

01:21:51.474 --> 01:21:52.940
I'm gonna go tell her.

01:21:58.113 --> 01:22:01.148
- Was he ital...
- was he Italian?

01:22:03.286 --> 01:22:05.052
Does he have to be?

01:22:10.191 --> 01:22:11.959
I, uh...

01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:17.231
What?

01:22:17.233 --> 01:22:20.134
I have to pee.

01:22:20.136 --> 01:22:22.136
You gotta what?
You gotta pee?

01:22:22.138 --> 01:22:25.506
I have to pee.

01:22:25.508 --> 01:22:30.210
I've been down here
for a long time.

01:22:30.212 --> 01:22:33.247
All right.

01:22:33.249 --> 01:22:36.283
Well, unfortunately we don't
have a bathroom,

01:22:36.285 --> 01:22:38.585
so...

01:22:38.587 --> 01:22:40.354
That's what you got.

01:22:42.057 --> 01:22:44.959
Sorry.

01:22:44.961 --> 01:22:46.126
It's all right.

01:22:46.128 --> 01:22:48.562
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm.

01:22:48.564 --> 01:22:50.397
- Really?
- I can handle it.

01:22:50.399 --> 01:22:52.166
Okay.

01:22:53.535 --> 01:22:55.302
All right.

01:22:58.473 --> 01:23:00.407
All right. Oh.

01:23:06.481 --> 01:23:09.216
Don't go running off on me.

01:23:09.218 --> 01:23:10.985
Okay.

01:23:17.592 --> 01:23:19.593
I don't wanna hurt you.

01:23:22.098 --> 01:23:24.999
Mmm.

01:23:37.213 --> 01:23:40.147
Oh, that feels really good.

01:23:40.149 --> 01:23:42.583
All right.

01:23:42.585 --> 01:23:45.152
Those are staying on.

01:23:47.055 --> 01:23:49.456
Don't go running on me,
and I'll tell you what.

01:23:49.458 --> 01:23:52.059
- Okay.
- You do your thing.

01:23:52.061 --> 01:23:55.362
I'm not gonna watch.
I'm not gonna listen.

01:23:55.364 --> 01:23:58.098
I'm gonna sit over here

01:23:58.100 --> 01:24:00.734
and sing a happy tune

01:24:00.736 --> 01:24:02.569
all to myself.

01:24:04.105 --> 01:24:06.507
You're gonna do your thing.

01:24:06.509 --> 01:24:09.410
- I'll just hang out.
- Okay.

01:24:09.412 --> 01:24:11.645
- Okay?
- Thank you.

01:24:18.253 --> 01:24:20.154
Would you like to hear
a certain song?

01:24:20.156 --> 01:24:22.289
I have a great voice,
I've been told.

01:24:22.291 --> 01:24:24.525
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

01:24:24.527 --> 01:24:26.460
I don't know.
Whatever you want.

01:24:58.693 --> 01:25:00.461
I could use a little help.

01:25:08.603 --> 01:25:10.370
From me?

01:25:13.775 --> 01:25:16.577
What kind of help do you need?

01:25:25.553 --> 01:25:27.454
You gotta take 'em off?

01:25:33.895 --> 01:25:35.229
That's what you need help with?

01:25:35.231 --> 01:25:36.730
Uh-huh.

01:25:36.732 --> 01:25:38.632
Yeah?

01:26:10.165 --> 01:26:11.865
Frank?

01:26:11.867 --> 01:26:13.800
Frank, are you home?

01:26:20.441 --> 01:26:22.209
Frank!

01:26:25.213 --> 01:26:26.780
You home?

01:26:29.250 --> 01:26:30.817
Frankie?

01:26:33.288 --> 01:26:35.722
Frankie, it's dad!

01:26:52.373 --> 01:26:53.840
Who are you?

01:26:55.577 --> 01:26:58.645
Friend of the family.

01:26:58.647 --> 01:26:59.713
You frank's dad?

01:27:01.282 --> 01:27:03.650
Yeah.

01:27:03.652 --> 01:27:05.852
You know where he is?

01:27:05.854 --> 01:27:06.920
No.

01:27:08.890 --> 01:27:11.391
No? Then what the fuck
are you doing here?

01:27:16.898 --> 01:27:18.799
How do you know frank?

01:27:20.568 --> 01:27:22.502
We have a mutual friend.

01:27:24.939 --> 01:27:27.007
Mickey Duro.

01:27:29.978 --> 01:27:31.712
Mickey, huh?

01:27:45.426 --> 01:27:46.660
You better pray that sick fuck

01:27:46.662 --> 01:27:48.362
doesn't touch
my daughter, bitch,

01:27:48.364 --> 01:27:50.931
or I'll cut your fucking jaw off
with a hacksaw, okay?

01:27:50.933 --> 01:27:54.034
Cunt.

01:28:01.542 --> 01:28:02.709
Oh, yeah!

01:28:57.799 --> 01:29:00.434
Stop.

01:29:00.436 --> 01:29:02.636
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:29:35.536 --> 01:29:37.104
Hey.

01:29:39.407 --> 01:29:42.109
- Trav?
- Frank.

01:29:42.111 --> 01:29:43.643
Yeah, it's me.

01:29:43.645 --> 01:29:45.979
Hey, look, man,

01:29:45.981 --> 01:29:47.981
what do you say
we end this, okay?

01:29:47.983 --> 01:29:50.083
You know, we each got something
the other guy wants,

01:29:50.085 --> 01:29:51.485
so let's just call it even, man.

01:29:51.487 --> 01:29:55.055
You know, call it quits.
What do you say?

01:29:55.057 --> 01:29:57.023
Yeah, I'm ready when you are.

01:29:57.025 --> 01:29:59.659
Really? Good.

01:29:59.661 --> 01:30:01.027
Usual place?

01:30:04.132 --> 01:30:05.899
Yeah.

01:30:07.602 --> 01:30:09.736
How's Gina?

01:30:09.738 --> 01:30:10.837
She's a little banged up,
you know.

01:30:10.839 --> 01:30:11.972
Niko caught her pretty good,

01:30:11.974 --> 01:30:14.141
but she'll be okay.
Crystal?

01:30:17.111 --> 01:30:20.914
Yeah, she's a little
banged up, too.

01:30:20.916 --> 01:30:22.149
I'll see you in an hour.

01:30:22.151 --> 01:30:24.584
Don't be late.

01:30:46.841 --> 01:30:48.909
Who was that?

01:30:51.646 --> 01:30:53.213
That was your dad.

01:30:56.651 --> 01:30:58.218
What's with you?

01:31:05.660 --> 01:31:07.727
That never happened.

01:31:09.897 --> 01:31:11.465
- You understand?
- You're joking.

01:31:11.467 --> 01:31:13.200
Do I look like I'm joking?

01:31:13.202 --> 01:31:15.802
You don't say anything
to anybody.

01:31:15.804 --> 01:31:18.171
- Okay?
- Yeah.

01:31:18.173 --> 01:31:21.575
You a big girl? Are you gonna be good?
You gonna be all right?

01:31:21.577 --> 01:31:23.577
- Hmm?
- I'm a very big girl.

01:31:23.579 --> 01:31:25.846
Okay.

01:31:25.848 --> 01:31:29.950
'Cause I'll find out who you love and I
will gut them like a fucking fish, cutie.

01:31:43.931 --> 01:31:45.999
Ah, frank.

01:32:58.739 --> 01:33:01.808
The woman you love.

01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:21.828
My dad is gonna fucking
kill you.

01:34:06.073 --> 01:34:08.775
Now you're gonna see
who you're really married to.

01:34:08.777 --> 01:34:10.710
Come on, baby.

01:34:10.712 --> 01:34:15.281
It's okay, it's okay, come on.
Relax. Come on. Just relax.

01:34:15.283 --> 01:34:17.350
Come here, you motherfucker.
Come here.

01:34:17.352 --> 01:34:20.654
Get the fuck out of there.
Okay. Calm down, now. Calm down.

01:34:20.656 --> 01:34:23.723
All right, relax.
You know what this is?

01:34:23.725 --> 01:34:27.160
Huh? You walk.
Let's go. Walk.

01:34:27.162 --> 01:34:28.828
I said walk!

01:34:28.830 --> 01:34:30.997
Don't cry. No crying.
Ain't no crying.

01:34:30.999 --> 01:34:34.701
Ain't no crying in baseball,
ain't no crying in dying.

01:34:34.703 --> 01:34:36.136
Except for this motherfucker
right here.

01:34:36.138 --> 01:34:40.707
Get the fuck down.
Relax. Come here, fucker.

01:34:40.709 --> 01:34:42.308
I'll blow your motherfucking
head off, you know that?

01:34:42.310 --> 01:34:44.144
Don't fucking move.

01:34:47.448 --> 01:34:49.215
Come on, bitch.

01:34:53.287 --> 01:34:55.121
Motherfucker.
Come on, come on.

01:34:55.123 --> 01:34:56.690
No!

01:34:59.093 --> 01:35:01.061
You like that? Huh?

01:35:03.397 --> 01:35:07.033
Hey, frank.
Frank, you see this?

01:35:07.035 --> 01:35:11.137
I'll blow this bitch's brains
right the fuck out.

01:35:11.139 --> 01:35:14.007
You better relax,
motherfucker. Slow!

01:35:15.876 --> 01:35:18.712
Slow.

01:35:18.714 --> 01:35:21.414
Hey, frank, I said slow.

01:35:21.416 --> 01:35:23.349
Goddamn it, leave her...

01:35:23.351 --> 01:35:25.885
hey, baby, you okay?
Okay, okay, I get it.

01:35:25.887 --> 01:35:28.188
I get it.
Slow. Slow, frank, slow.

01:35:28.190 --> 01:35:30.857
- Honey, you okay?
- Yes, yes.

01:35:30.859 --> 01:35:32.192
Hey, frank, come on.

01:35:32.194 --> 01:35:34.928
- It's over. Let her go.
- Aah!

01:35:34.930 --> 01:35:38.498
Hey, frank. I'm cool.
Hey, hey, hey, come on.

01:35:38.500 --> 01:35:40.300
Did you ever think we'd be across
from each other like this?

01:35:40.302 --> 01:35:42.869
I mean, all the things
we've been through together?

01:35:42.871 --> 01:35:45.071
Come on, what are we doing?

01:35:45.073 --> 01:35:48.174
All right, look, I admit it.
I went overboard.

01:35:48.176 --> 01:35:50.076
I did.

01:35:50.078 --> 01:35:53.113
- But I had to send a message. You talked, frank.
- Aah!

01:35:53.115 --> 01:35:54.414
Hey, hey, hey, come on.

01:35:54.416 --> 01:35:58.351
You talked, man.
You talked.

01:35:58.353 --> 01:36:01.287
Come on, frank. It's over.
Let's stop this, man.

01:36:01.289 --> 01:36:04.257
Can I just go?
Can't I just go? Can't I go?

01:36:04.259 --> 01:36:06.392
Yeah, let her go.
Let her go, frank. Come on.

01:36:06.394 --> 01:36:10.330
It's over.
Let's stop this.

01:36:10.332 --> 01:36:12.932
No, no, no, no. No. No.

01:36:12.934 --> 01:36:16.102
No! No, no, no, no!
Hey!

01:36:16.104 --> 01:36:19.873
That's my daughter,
motherfucker, you let her go!

01:36:19.875 --> 01:36:22.942
Goddamn it!

01:36:28.282 --> 01:36:29.949
Stop it.

01:36:29.951 --> 01:36:33.119
Frank, stop it.
That's my daughter. Stop it.

01:36:33.121 --> 01:36:36.022
I've got nothing.

01:36:36.024 --> 01:36:38.124
You took everything
from me, Mick.

01:36:42.563 --> 01:36:45.331
Okay, look.

01:36:45.333 --> 01:36:49.135
- Daddy, da...
- we are who we are.

01:36:49.137 --> 01:36:53.106
We are.
But she's not.

01:36:53.108 --> 01:36:55.275
Frank, she's not.

01:36:55.277 --> 01:36:59.078
Just... just... I'm begging you.
Just... just please.

01:36:59.080 --> 01:37:00.313
Let my daughter go, please.

01:37:00.315 --> 01:37:03.917
And if I got nothing...

01:37:03.919 --> 01:37:06.186
Frank.

01:37:06.188 --> 01:37:08.121
Come on, frank.

01:37:08.123 --> 01:37:10.456
Then Mick...

01:37:10.458 --> 01:37:12.258
You got nothing!

01:39:26.193 --> 01:39:28.394
You know I'd like to see
if we could,

01:39:28.396 --> 01:39:30.363
maybe try to work things out.

01:40:13.273 --> 01:40:15.675
Hey, you've reached frank and
Gina. Sorry we missed you.

01:40:15.677 --> 01:40:19.545
Leave us a message.

01:40:19.547 --> 01:40:21.314
Frank.

01:40:23.217 --> 01:40:24.784
It's your mom.

01:40:29.190 --> 01:40:33.192
I'm sorry I haven't
called you back.

01:40:33.194 --> 01:40:36.462
Actually I'm glad
you didn't pick up.

01:40:36.464 --> 01:40:40.400
I'm just not ready
to talk to you yet.

01:40:41.769 --> 01:40:44.070
You're not right, Frankie.

01:40:46.307 --> 01:40:50.276
I'm sorry. I love you.

01:40:50.278 --> 01:40:52.145
But please don't call me again.

01:40:53.305 --> 01:40:59.415
