[panting]

00:45.393 --> 00:48.004
...please.

00:48.091 --> 00:50.006
I won't say anything.

00:51.573 --> 00:54.315
What are you waiting for?

00:54.402 --> 00:56.056
No. No.

00:56.143 --> 00:57.883
No! No!

00:57.970 --> 00:59.885
Aah!

[phone rings]

01:21.124 --> 01:23.126
A word when you're finished.

01:23.213 --> 01:25.085
Yes, Mr. Volker.

01:27.130 --> 01:28.784
I'm on my way now.

01:28.871 --> 01:30.394
'Our reservation's at 8:00.'

01:30.481 --> 01:33.093
Come on, you grab his feet.

01:33.180 --> 01:36.052
[man grunts]

01:36.139 --> 01:38.924
- God.
- Man, he's heavy.

01:39.011 --> 01:41.275
You've got the light end.

01:41.362 --> 01:43.233
'Trying to kill it.'

01:50.849 --> 01:52.590
Bye.

01:52.677 --> 01:55.419
Let's get out.

01:55.506 --> 01:58.727
- 'Listen, you around tomorrow?'
- 'Yeah, why?'

01:58.814 --> 02:00.642
'Might have another
job for you.'

02:00.729 --> 02:02.557
[whirs]

02:02.644 --> 02:05.951
Wait.

02:06.038 --> 02:08.737
You hear that?

02:08.824 --> 02:10.695
'Hello, someone there?'

02:20.966 --> 02:22.881
Come out here.

02:28.887 --> 02:31.716
What do we do?

02:31.803 --> 02:33.283
'No choice.'

02:33.370 --> 02:35.242
He's a witness.

02:38.854 --> 02:40.769
Take care of it.

02:53.608 --> 02:55.305
What do we got?

02:55.392 --> 02:56.915
Victim's male, 30s.

02:57.002 --> 02:58.656
Still working to ID him.

02:58.743 --> 03:00.267
Based on the level of decomp,
the coroner thinks

03:00.354 --> 03:01.877
he's been dead
for about two months.

03:01.964 --> 03:04.662
Oakland PD says that's when
the building was boarded up.

03:04.749 --> 03:06.055
Cause of death?

03:06.142 --> 03:07.317
'Because of marks on
the victim's neck'

03:07.404 --> 03:11.278
'the coroner's thinking
strangulation.'

03:11.365 --> 03:13.323
- Dried blood?
- Looks like.

03:13.410 --> 03:15.717
So the victim was killed here
and then moved over there?

03:15.804 --> 03:17.153
Yeah, but no
drag marks, and..

03:17.240 --> 03:19.938
...he looks to be
at least 200 pounds.

03:20.025 --> 03:21.679
'You think there's
a second killer?'

03:21.766 --> 03:24.508
'Big guy like that, tough
to carry on your own.'

03:24.595 --> 03:27.163
Rigsby, did anyone else have,
uh, access to this building?

03:27.250 --> 03:28.817
Not since it
was boarded up.

03:28.904 --> 03:30.471
Oakland PD say there was
no sign of forced entry

03:30.558 --> 03:31.820
when the demo crew arrived
and found the body.

03:31.907 --> 03:32.821
Hmm.

03:32.908 --> 03:33.865
[phone rings]

03:33.952 --> 03:35.084
Excuse me a minute.

03:44.311 --> 03:46.008
It's a remote-controlled car.

03:48.140 --> 03:51.753
I found it, just there.
Odd, don't you think?

03:51.840 --> 03:53.233
Okay, I have an
ID on the victim.

03:53.320 --> 03:55.191
His name's Horatio Jones.

03:55.278 --> 03:57.324
- Horatio Jones?
- Yeah, you know him?

03:57.411 --> 03:59.108
I know of him.

03:59.195 --> 04:00.631
Horatio Jones

04:00.718 --> 04:02.677
'he was a geologist
for an energy company'

04:02.764 --> 04:04.156
owned by Tommy Volker.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.637
He was set to testify before
a grand jury against

04:06.724 --> 04:09.684
Volker two months ago, and
then he disappeared.

04:09.771 --> 04:14.602
I always thought Volker was
behind it, but now I know it.

04:14.689 --> 04:16.081
Volker did this.

04:20.347 --> 04:23.263
[theme music]

04:33.882 --> 04:34.926
The coroner investigator
found tissue

04:35.013 --> 04:36.319
under the victim's
fingernails.

04:36.406 --> 04:37.755
- It's headed to the lab now.
- Good.

04:37.842 --> 04:39.148
And make sure the ME
gets me the results

04:39.235 --> 04:40.497
from the autopsy as
soon as possible.

04:40.584 --> 04:41.672
I want to move
quickly on this.

04:41.759 --> 04:43.631
Yes, boss.

04:45.720 --> 04:47.765
Volker wouldn't have
killed Jones himself.

04:47.852 --> 04:49.114
He never gets
his hands dirty.

04:49.201 --> 04:50.812
I'm thinking it
was Charles Milk.

04:50.899 --> 04:53.075
Well, that would be helpful
if only Charles Milk

04:53.162 --> 04:54.772
hadn't been killed
last week.

04:54.859 --> 04:56.557
The forensics thinks they
might have something.

04:56.644 --> 04:58.646
It might even tie
Volker to the crime.

04:58.733 --> 05:00.735
Oh, you think
he was here?

05:00.822 --> 05:03.607
He gets off on this,
watching his victims die.

05:03.694 --> 05:06.784
- I need Volker's DNA.
- Well, just ask him for it.

05:06.871 --> 05:10.092
- You think he'd give it to me?
- Yes, Volker's arrogant.

05:10.179 --> 05:11.702
He likes to pretend he
has nothing to hide.

05:11.789 --> 05:14.488
Lisbon, answer me this.

05:14.575 --> 05:16.751
Who would leave this here?

05:16.838 --> 05:19.362
- A-a small child?
- Yeah, like 9 or 10 years old.

05:19.449 --> 05:20.537
Something like that.

05:20.624 --> 05:22.365
- Most likely a boy.
- Yeah.

05:22.452 --> 05:24.236
A boy that hasn't been
here in two months

05:24.324 --> 05:25.237
'cause that's when Oakland PD

05:25.325 --> 05:26.674
said this place was boarded up.

05:26.761 --> 05:27.718
What are you getting at?

05:27.805 --> 05:29.677
Well, no self-respecting kid..

05:29.764 --> 05:31.853
...would leave
this behind.

05:31.940 --> 05:33.724
Other than the dust, it's
practically brand-new.

05:33.811 --> 05:38.381
Which means he left it
for an urgent reason.

05:38.468 --> 05:41.428
- He witnessed the murder.
- Or it's just a toy car.

05:41.515 --> 05:43.168
It's thin, I know.

05:43.255 --> 05:45.475
Ifthere was a boy, and
ifhe witnessed a murder

05:45.562 --> 05:47.303
he would've come
forward months ago.

05:47.390 --> 05:48.957
Not if the killer found him.

05:49.044 --> 05:50.611
If that was the case

05:50.698 --> 05:52.961
we would've found his body
with Jones', don't you think?

05:53.048 --> 05:54.963
Yes, one would think.

05:55.050 --> 05:56.486
I'm gonna go
talk to Volker.

05:56.573 --> 05:59.359
And you go and look into
this theoretical kid.

05:59.446 --> 06:00.621
You don't want me
to come with you?

06:00.708 --> 06:02.971
No, I'll meet you
back at the office.

06:03.058 --> 06:05.147
Fine.

06:05.234 --> 06:07.758
[Volker]
The maiden voyage of Volker
intergalactic has been set.

06:07.845 --> 06:10.935
It's been publicized.
We're not postponing.

06:11.022 --> 06:13.198
If you can't find
a solution, find another job.

06:16.201 --> 06:18.943
Agent Lisbon.

06:19.030 --> 06:22.207
I have to admit, I'm
surprised to see you again.

06:22.294 --> 06:25.994
Surprised, but... pleased.

06:26.081 --> 06:28.170
We found your missing employee.

06:28.257 --> 06:31.216
- Employee?
- Horatio Jones.

06:31.303 --> 06:32.783
He'd been missing
for two months.

06:32.870 --> 06:36.657
He worked for a company
you own, VNX Energy.

06:36.744 --> 06:41.096
We found his body earlier
this morning...murdered.

06:41.183 --> 06:42.880
I'm sorry to hear that.

06:42.967 --> 06:44.839
Did you know him?

06:44.926 --> 06:47.624
Oh, I have thousands
of employees, agent.

06:47.711 --> 06:51.019
Unfortunately, I don't
get to meet each one.

06:51.106 --> 06:53.325
Well, that's odd, because
Jones was deposed in a

06:53.413 --> 06:55.980
grand jury inquiry
into your activities.

06:56.067 --> 06:58.243
I said I didn't know.

06:58.330 --> 07:00.594
Not that I didn't
know, about him.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.729
Jones was working
in the amazon

07:05.816 --> 07:08.950
as part of a geothermal energy
project I was developing.

07:09.037 --> 07:10.865
A project that ran
into problems

07:10.952 --> 07:13.868
when a local tribe claimed
the site as sacred ground.

07:13.955 --> 07:17.349
Weeks later, the tribe was
found dead in a mass grave.

07:17.437 --> 07:20.309
This again. I see
we've come full circle.

07:20.396 --> 07:21.919
You were implicated
in a crime.

07:22.006 --> 07:23.878
In fact, a grand jury
was convened

07:23.965 --> 07:26.228
to investigate
your involvement.

07:26.315 --> 07:28.012
That investigation
was dropped.

07:28.099 --> 07:30.232
Only after two people
who were gonna testify

07:30.319 --> 07:32.147
against you
were found dead.

07:32.234 --> 07:34.541
Cassie Flood and Amanda Shaw.
Jones makes three.

07:34.628 --> 07:36.586
Tragic loss, but again..

07:36.673 --> 07:38.240
...territory we've covered.

07:38.327 --> 07:40.851
Jones was on his way to turn
in evidence against you

07:40.938 --> 07:43.419
when he went missing, well,
excuse me, when he was murdered.

07:43.506 --> 07:46.596
Do you enjoy this,
Agent Lisbon?

07:46.683 --> 07:48.076
Hmm?

07:48.163 --> 07:50.339
Wasting your time

07:50.426 --> 07:54.474
on this fruitless effort
to persecute me?

07:54.561 --> 07:56.345
Is that really
why you're here?

07:56.432 --> 07:58.478
Actually, um..

07:58.565 --> 08:02.264
..I came to get
a DNA Sample.

08:02.351 --> 08:04.396
Unless for some reason,
you'd rather not.

08:07.965 --> 08:09.837
And what reason
would that be?

08:30.988 --> 08:33.295
I know you had
Jones killed

08:33.382 --> 08:34.992
'just like Cassie Flood
and Amanda Shaw.'

08:35.079 --> 08:36.951
And this time I'm
gonna prove it.

08:41.477 --> 08:43.348
Best of luck to you, agent.

08:49.093 --> 08:51.705
Alright, here it is, a complete
list of all the children

08:51.792 --> 08:54.098
reported missing two months
ago in the Oakland area.

08:54.185 --> 08:55.622
How many are there?

08:55.709 --> 08:57.885
- '12 total.'
- 'Well, let's cut that down.'

08:57.972 --> 09:01.105
We know we're looking for a boy
between the ages of 9 and 12.

09:01.192 --> 09:02.977
Old enough to be out on the
street, but young enough

09:03.064 --> 09:05.370
to be playing with a
remote-controlled car.

09:05.457 --> 09:07.764
'Okay, that got
us down to five.'

09:07.851 --> 09:09.940
Alright, now the
boy was playing

09:10.027 --> 09:11.855
alone in a
bad neighborhood.

09:11.942 --> 09:13.770
Probably from a low-income

09:13.857 --> 09:15.729
single-parent family.

09:17.165 --> 09:18.601
Two left.

09:18.688 --> 09:20.560
Which one lived closer
to the crime scene?

09:20.647 --> 09:22.431
'Mmm.'

09:22.518 --> 09:24.128
'Marvin Pettigrew.'

09:24.215 --> 09:26.870
'His home is half a mile
from the warehouse.'

09:26.957 --> 09:29.786
Marvin Pettigrew.

09:29.873 --> 09:31.745
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

09:35.357 --> 09:37.011
How'd it go with Volker?

09:37.098 --> 09:39.404
Good. He gave up his DNA.
Just like you said he would.

09:39.491 --> 09:40.449
He's behind this, Jane.

09:40.536 --> 09:42.190
- I know it.
- But?

09:42.277 --> 09:44.192
When the grand jury
investigation was dropped

09:44.279 --> 09:45.759
Volker's lawyers had
all the evidence

09:45.846 --> 09:47.369
and court documents
sealed from the case

09:47.456 --> 09:49.110
including Jones'
deposition.

09:49.197 --> 09:50.677
I think there's something
in there that Volker

09:50.764 --> 09:52.113
doesn't want
us to know.

09:52.200 --> 09:53.114
If I could just get
my hands on it.

09:53.201 --> 09:55.116
Well, why can't you?

09:55.203 --> 09:57.988
They're sealed documents,
Jane, it's against the law.

09:58.075 --> 10:01.426
Well, if you want to get Volker
you can't let that stop you.

10:01.513 --> 10:03.298
What do you suggest?

10:03.385 --> 10:06.344
Well, Ardiles is a deputy DA.
He's gonna have the deposition.

10:06.431 --> 10:08.564
Ardiles is not gonna stick
his neck out for me.

10:08.651 --> 10:10.958
Well, of course not.
He's a smart lawyer.

10:11.045 --> 10:12.612
You have to get
something on him

10:12.699 --> 10:14.962
that will make him
help you.

10:15.049 --> 10:17.094
Blackmail the deputy
district attorney?

10:17.181 --> 10:19.096
Sure. Why not?

10:21.969 --> 10:24.188
Well, how could I
get dirt on Ardiles?

10:24.275 --> 10:26.626
Ask yourself this.

10:26.713 --> 10:29.237
Who makes it their business
to know everyone else's?

10:34.111 --> 10:37.027
Well, I have to hand it to you.
You get right to the point.

10:37.114 --> 10:39.203
It's actually refreshing.

10:39.290 --> 10:40.378
Will you help me?

10:40.465 --> 10:41.641
Maybe.

10:41.728 --> 10:43.381
What's your problem
with Ardiles?

10:43.468 --> 10:45.557
I don't have a problem with
Ardiles. It's about a case.

10:45.645 --> 10:46.994
What case?

10:47.081 --> 10:48.909
- I can't tell you.
- Mm.

10:48.996 --> 10:50.650
I don't know, Teresa.

10:50.737 --> 10:52.390
Brenda

10:52.477 --> 10:54.828
I'll owe you.

10:54.915 --> 10:57.744
One day, you'll need a favor,
and I will owe you.

11:02.966 --> 11:05.055
I can't give you any
specific details

11:05.142 --> 11:08.668
but if you were to mention
the Ferland case to Ardiles

11:08.755 --> 11:11.279
you might find him more
compliant to your request.

11:11.366 --> 11:14.151
- Thank you.
- Teresa.

11:14.238 --> 11:16.110
It's murky water
you're swimming in.

11:16.197 --> 11:17.502
Whatever this is about

11:17.589 --> 11:18.982
I hope it's worth it.

11:19.069 --> 11:20.941
It is.

11:25.119 --> 11:27.687
Marvin went missing.

11:27.774 --> 11:29.514
61 days ago.

11:30.951 --> 11:33.127
His teacher watched
him leave the school.

11:33.214 --> 11:36.347
That was the last
time anyone saw him.

11:36.434 --> 11:39.481
I found a toy car at an
abandoned warehouse.

11:39.568 --> 11:41.831
I just wanted to..

11:41.918 --> 11:45.008
If it, uh, if it
belonged to your son.

11:45.095 --> 11:46.967
[sobbing]

11:55.758 --> 11:58.892
That was his
birthday present.

11:58.979 --> 12:00.850
He'd wanted it
for months.

12:05.072 --> 12:07.117
You say you found
this at a warehouse?

12:07.204 --> 12:10.033
Yeah, half a
mile from here.

12:10.120 --> 12:11.992
I know the one.

12:12.949 --> 12:14.734
Marvin used to walk..

12:14.821 --> 12:17.040
...past it on his way
home from school.

12:17.127 --> 12:18.999
I told him not
to play there.

12:22.045 --> 12:24.961
That, uh, warehouse
was the..

12:25.048 --> 12:26.920
...was the scene
of a crime.

12:30.227 --> 12:32.099
A man was found
murdered there.

12:36.190 --> 12:38.061
Mr. Jane..

12:39.628 --> 12:41.543
...is my boy dead?

12:43.980 --> 12:46.156
I-I-I don't know.
I don't know.

12:52.032 --> 12:52.946
[knocks]

12:53.033 --> 12:54.251
Ardiles.

12:54.338 --> 12:57.037
- Lisbon.
- Thanks for coming by.

12:57.124 --> 12:58.516
Can I get you
something to drink?

12:58.603 --> 13:00.780
A drink? No I, uh, I
gotta be back in court

13:00.867 --> 13:03.434
in 20 minutes, so...
what's this about?

13:03.521 --> 13:05.393
Uh, two months ago,
there was a grand jury

13:05.480 --> 13:07.351
investigation into
Tommy Volker.

13:07.438 --> 13:10.224
A-a witness was deposed by
the name of Horatio Jones.

13:10.311 --> 13:12.792
The documents were sealed.

13:12.879 --> 13:15.490
And?

13:15.577 --> 13:17.666
I need that deposition.

13:17.753 --> 13:19.320
The deposition
was sealed

13:19.407 --> 13:21.365
by a grand jury.

13:21.452 --> 13:23.933
Two witnesses against Volker
have been found dead.

13:24.020 --> 13:25.456
We found a third
this morning.

13:25.543 --> 13:26.718
Yeah, and I'm sorry
to hear about that

13:26.806 --> 13:28.111
but I am not gonna break
the law for you.

13:28.198 --> 13:30.374
I understand. You're
under a lot of pressure.

13:30.461 --> 13:32.812
Maybe it's the job, maybe
it's the Ferland case..

13:36.119 --> 13:37.947
What do you know about
the Ferland case?

13:38.034 --> 13:40.384
Not a lot. Now.

13:40.471 --> 13:42.909
But I will if you don't
get me those depositions.

13:47.130 --> 13:49.959
Okay, you'll have them
within an hour.

14:07.455 --> 14:09.370
Hey, boss. How's it coming?

14:09.457 --> 14:10.806
Nothing so far.

14:10.893 --> 14:12.155
We already know
everything that's here.

14:12.242 --> 14:13.374
What about you?
Did you find anything?

14:13.461 --> 14:14.723
Maybe, in the deposition

14:14.810 --> 14:16.029
Jones mentions that a friend

14:16.116 --> 14:18.553
from college visited
him in Brazil

14:18.640 --> 14:20.468
'Annabelle Sugalski.'

14:20.555 --> 14:21.948
It's a shot in the dark,
but maybe Jones talked

14:22.035 --> 14:23.384
'to her about Volker.'

14:23.471 --> 14:25.342
- Bring her in.
- Okay.

14:27.954 --> 14:31.044
I knew Horatio worked
for Volker, but that's it.

14:31.131 --> 14:32.741
He never really
said much about him.

14:32.828 --> 14:35.309
Did he mention work,
the project he was on?

14:35.396 --> 14:37.050
Briefly, um.

14:37.137 --> 14:38.312
'It was an energy project,
right?'

14:38.399 --> 14:39.922
Yeah. In the amazon.

14:40.009 --> 14:42.229
All he said was that they
were having problems.

14:42.316 --> 14:44.535
Did Horatio say anything
about a mass killing?

14:44.622 --> 14:46.320
No.

14:46.407 --> 14:48.235
You're certain?

14:48.322 --> 14:50.193
Yeah. Of course.

14:53.196 --> 14:55.198
Annabelle, has anyone else
talked to you about this?

14:55.285 --> 14:56.721
What do you mean?

14:56.808 --> 14:59.681
Has anyone asked you to withhold
information from us?

14:59.768 --> 15:02.379
God, no.

15:02.466 --> 15:06.122
Look...I was in
Brazil on vacation.

15:06.209 --> 15:07.863
Horatio and I only saw each
othera couple oftimes

15:07.950 --> 15:09.865
dinner, drinks,
that's it.

15:09.952 --> 15:11.693
I'm sorry I
can't help you.

15:11.780 --> 15:14.696
'I wish I could.'

15:14.783 --> 15:17.264
[Volker]
'So what did you tell them?'

15:17.351 --> 15:20.832
Exactly what you
told me to. Nothing.

15:20.920 --> 15:23.052
And they believed you?

15:23.139 --> 15:25.011
Every word.

15:28.318 --> 15:29.624
And the voice mail

15:29.711 --> 15:31.756
Jones left for you?

15:33.541 --> 15:35.586
I deleted it.
You can check my phone.

15:40.330 --> 15:42.637
You know..

15:42.724 --> 15:44.595
...you're quite
the liability.

15:47.381 --> 15:49.252
And I hate liabilities.

15:53.387 --> 15:55.258
But I like you,
Annabelle.

15:58.566 --> 16:01.482
And I would hate for something
that happen to you.

16:01.569 --> 16:03.440
Please. I won't tell
anyone. I promise.

16:06.052 --> 16:07.183
I'm leaving the
country tonight

16:07.270 --> 16:09.142
you'll never
see me again.

16:10.882 --> 16:12.797
Well, that's a shame.

16:20.892 --> 16:22.807
Goodnight.

16:44.742 --> 16:45.961
Hi.

16:46.048 --> 16:47.658
Any luck
finding the kid?

16:47.745 --> 16:50.183
Well, we gave his name, and
his photo to local police

16:50.270 --> 16:52.359
and the FBI's department
of missing persons

16:52.446 --> 16:55.536
but it's like finding a needle
in a stack of needles.

16:55.623 --> 16:56.928
I heard you talked
to his mother.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.322
Yes. She thinks the worst.

16:59.409 --> 17:01.237
Hard not to agree with her.

17:01.324 --> 17:02.456
What about you?

17:02.543 --> 17:04.849
Burning the midnight oil, I see.

17:04.936 --> 17:06.851
There's gotta be
something here.

17:06.938 --> 17:09.202
Mm.

17:09.289 --> 17:10.725
Jane.

17:10.812 --> 17:12.640
Amanda Shaw
was my witness.

17:12.727 --> 17:15.208
I gave her my word that
I'd protect her

17:15.295 --> 17:17.384
and Volker had her killed.

17:28.177 --> 17:31.050
- You done with this?
- Mm-hmm.

17:31.137 --> 17:32.877
Good.

17:41.321 --> 17:43.062
Good morning, boss.
Just got word.

17:43.149 --> 17:45.020
Annabelle Sugalski left
the country last night.

17:45.107 --> 17:46.239
Flew out on a
red-eye to London.

17:46.326 --> 17:49.068
He got to her.
Damn it.

17:49.155 --> 17:51.461
In Jones' deposition, he
said that he gave evidence

17:51.548 --> 17:52.941
against Volker
in written reports.

17:53.028 --> 17:54.508
I saw that, but none
were ever found.

17:54.595 --> 17:56.901
What if Jones gave
them to his employer?

17:56.988 --> 17:59.252
- VNX Energy.
- Let's go check it out.

18:06.868 --> 18:09.827
That was the ME, with the
test results from the autopsy.

18:09.914 --> 18:12.830
DNA identifies Charles Milk
as one of the killers.

18:12.917 --> 18:16.530
The ME also found a second DNA,
a strand of hair.

18:16.617 --> 18:18.619
Was kind of hoping it was
Volker, but no such luck.

18:18.706 --> 18:20.838
No, Volker's far
too careful.

18:20.925 --> 18:22.884
So far, no match in
the federal database.

18:22.971 --> 18:25.713
It does prove there was another
person present at the murder.

18:25.800 --> 18:27.671
The question is,
who was it?

18:37.203 --> 18:39.335
Hi. We need to speak
with a manager.

18:39.422 --> 18:42.251
- Is everything alright?
- Just have a few questions.

18:42.338 --> 18:44.210
- Let me get him.
- Alright.

18:54.568 --> 18:55.525
Come on.

18:55.612 --> 18:59.312
We're leaving?

18:59.399 --> 19:01.749
Volker has been a step ahead
of us this entire time.

19:01.836 --> 19:03.794
He finds out we're looking
into VNX Energy

19:03.881 --> 19:06.188
any chance we have of finding
that evidence is gone.

19:08.103 --> 19:09.757
[Volker]
'"It rained for a week'

19:09.844 --> 19:11.628
'"night and day.'

19:11.715 --> 19:13.848
'"During the week the fish
were in their houses'

19:13.935 --> 19:15.632
"keeping nice and warm.

19:15.719 --> 19:17.591
"When it finally
stopped raining

19:17.678 --> 19:19.462
"all the fish went outside

19:19.549 --> 19:22.987
"and saw Spike in a small
puddle growing gills.

19:23.074 --> 19:25.294
"The fish yelled,
'How's life in the water?'

19:25.381 --> 19:27.035
"And Spike yelled
back, 'Great.'

19:27.122 --> 19:28.515
"'Come on in.'

19:28.602 --> 19:32.083
"And that is why
fish live in water.

19:33.694 --> 19:36.436
"The end."

19:36.523 --> 19:39.787
What do we say to Mr. Volker
for sharing his time with us?

19:39.874 --> 19:42.964
[children]
Thank you, Mr. Volker.

19:43.051 --> 19:45.053
You're very welcome.

19:45.140 --> 19:48.012
- Thank you. See you again.
- Mm-hmm.

19:48.099 --> 19:50.014
Bye, kids.

19:52.626 --> 19:54.454
Uh, Mr. Volker.

19:54.541 --> 19:55.585
Patrick Jane.

19:55.672 --> 19:57.283
I work with
Teresa Lisbon.

19:57.370 --> 19:59.546
Ah, yes. Mr. Jane.

19:59.633 --> 20:01.330
Nice to meet you.

20:01.417 --> 20:03.376
Any friend of Teresa's.

20:03.463 --> 20:05.726
She's a-she's a fascinating
woman, isn't she?

20:05.813 --> 20:07.031
Certainly.

20:07.118 --> 20:08.555
Well, that was impressive.

20:08.642 --> 20:11.297
Not only are you a
super-successful businessman

20:11.384 --> 20:13.299
but you're quite the
vivid storyteller.

20:13.386 --> 20:14.822
For a moment there, I
was splashing around

20:14.909 --> 20:17.346
in that puddle with Spike,
growing some gills.

20:17.433 --> 20:19.740
[chuckles]

20:19.827 --> 20:20.871
Was there something
you needed?

20:20.958 --> 20:22.743
Need? No.

20:22.830 --> 20:26.486
I just wanted to meet you
while I have the chance.

20:26.573 --> 20:27.487
Are you going somewhere?

20:27.574 --> 20:30.577
No. But you are.

20:30.664 --> 20:32.883
After your arrest, things are
bound to get a little hectic

20:32.970 --> 20:35.016
and I probably won't have the
chance to introduce myself.

20:35.103 --> 20:37.758
- So, so here I am.
- Very droll.

20:37.845 --> 20:39.847
But you and
I both know

20:39.934 --> 20:41.805
that I'm not gonna
be arrested.

20:45.940 --> 20:47.855
You sure about that?

20:52.903 --> 20:54.383
Are you finished?

20:54.470 --> 20:55.906
Yes.

21:02.826 --> 21:04.698
[indistinct chattering]

21:06.917 --> 21:09.311
[phone rings]

21:09.398 --> 21:11.574
[Patrick]
'Gray suit,
salt-and-pepper hair'

21:11.661 --> 21:12.793
'about 6 feet tall.'

21:12.880 --> 21:14.098
'He's coming out now.'

21:14.185 --> 21:16.100
Alright. Got him.

21:18.015 --> 21:19.887
[camera shutter clicks]

21:30.289 --> 21:31.812
Good evening, Agent Lisbon.

21:31.899 --> 21:33.727
I am sorry to bother
you, your honor.

21:33.814 --> 21:35.685
'Alright, let's see it.'

21:38.035 --> 21:40.473
- So how are Emily and Ruth?
- They're good.

21:40.560 --> 21:42.605
Emily's at
Santa Cruz, right?

21:42.692 --> 21:46.000
- Santa Clara.
- Yeah.

21:46.087 --> 21:48.829
- Is this all you have?
- Yes.

21:48.916 --> 21:51.745
But it's clear that Tommy
Volker is a very dangerous man.

21:51.832 --> 21:54.356
Well, that may be
true, Agent Lisbon..

21:54.443 --> 21:55.923
...but this is not
enough for a warrant.

21:56.010 --> 21:57.403
Your honor, if you just--

21:57.490 --> 21:58.926
You have no proof
that evidence against Mr. Volker

21:59.013 --> 22:00.362
is inside VNX Industries.

22:00.449 --> 22:02.973
I'm sorry. I can't sign it.

22:03.060 --> 22:05.324
Yes, your honor.

22:05.411 --> 22:07.326
Good evening.

22:16.509 --> 22:18.380
[phone rings]

22:21.165 --> 22:22.558
Hello, Lisbon. What's up?

22:22.645 --> 22:24.343
I just left Judge Davis' office.

22:24.430 --> 22:26.519
She won't sign
the VNX warrant.

22:26.606 --> 22:28.085
Are you asking me
what I would do?

22:28.172 --> 22:31.175
No. I already know
the answer.

22:31.262 --> 22:33.177
Okay. Goodnight, Lisbon.

22:40.271 --> 22:42.230
'I am sorry, but
that was my office.'

22:42.317 --> 22:43.884
We got it, confirmation
that there's evidence

22:43.971 --> 22:46.669
against Thomas Volker inside
the VNX Energy offices.

22:46.756 --> 22:48.410
What kind of confirmation?

22:48.497 --> 22:50.673
It's a coworker of Jones who
still works at the company.

22:50.760 --> 22:52.545
I can get you a transcript
of the questioning

22:52.632 --> 22:55.374
first thing in the morning,
but time is of the essence.

23:16.743 --> 23:18.614
Got something.

23:19.963 --> 23:21.878
'Don Clyde, 48.'

23:21.965 --> 23:23.880
'No priors.'

23:23.967 --> 23:26.448
Looks like he was a ward of
the state when his mother died.

23:26.535 --> 23:28.102
'Spent the last six years
working as'

23:28.189 --> 23:29.973
'a private security contractor
in the Middle East.'

23:30.060 --> 23:31.410
A mercenary.

23:31.497 --> 23:32.846
Does he have any family?

23:32.933 --> 23:34.500
Uh...yep.

23:34.587 --> 23:36.327
Younger brother,
John Clyde.

23:36.415 --> 23:38.678
But he's serving two years in
Lompoc on a battery charge.

23:38.765 --> 23:41.332
Mm.

23:41.420 --> 23:43.726
Alright. I want this to be
careful and methodical.

23:43.813 --> 23:47.295
I don't want anything
to slip through the cracks.

23:47.382 --> 23:49.297
Oh, no.

23:53.954 --> 23:54.911
Volker.

23:54.998 --> 23:55.956
How'd he know?

24:18.239 --> 24:20.110
I'm looking for Agent Lisbon.

24:25.115 --> 24:27.030
'Boss.'

24:29.250 --> 24:31.208
What are you doing here?

24:31.295 --> 24:33.820
Such hostility.

24:33.907 --> 24:35.430
And here I thought we
were mending fences.

24:35.517 --> 24:38.477
Answer the question.

24:38.564 --> 24:42.959
I came to ask you to drop
this ridiculous investigation.

24:43.046 --> 24:44.526
I hate to see an
officer of the law

24:44.613 --> 24:47.398
humiliated like this.

24:47.486 --> 24:49.966
Cho, will you show
Mr. Volker out of here?

24:50.053 --> 24:52.099
Gladly.

24:52.186 --> 24:54.841
I'm only looking out
for your best interests.

24:54.928 --> 24:56.799
No, you're not.

24:58.845 --> 25:02.675
You want us to think that
you're gloating, but you're not.

25:02.762 --> 25:04.459
You're afraid.

25:04.546 --> 25:06.940
- Afraid?
- Yeah.

25:07.027 --> 25:09.420
well, this certainly is a
strange way of showing it.

25:09.508 --> 25:12.075
I can see right through you.

25:12.162 --> 25:15.035
We were close, searching
your offices like that.

25:15.122 --> 25:16.558
'Too close.'

25:16.645 --> 25:18.212
You want us to think
that you're in control

25:18.299 --> 25:19.430
that you're untouchable.

25:19.518 --> 25:21.694
But you're not.

25:21.781 --> 25:23.652
You're afraid of us.

25:25.175 --> 25:27.047
And you should be.

25:41.714 --> 25:44.673
So you think Don Clyde
helped kill Horatio Jones?

25:44.760 --> 25:46.849
Yeah, I'm sure of it.
Well..

25:46.936 --> 25:48.416
...fairly sure of it.

25:48.503 --> 25:50.070
But we have no proof.

25:50.157 --> 25:52.072
Correct.

25:52.159 --> 25:54.030
So if we bring him in, we
won't have any leverage

25:54.117 --> 25:56.076
but if we keep digging,
Volker might find out

25:56.163 --> 25:57.556
and make him disappear.

25:57.643 --> 25:59.035
So bring him in

25:59.122 --> 26:01.298
and fake the leverage.

26:04.824 --> 26:06.695
[tires screeching]

26:10.699 --> 26:12.135
- Get out.
- Hands in the air.

26:12.222 --> 26:14.660
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Turn around.

26:14.747 --> 26:16.400
- Whoa.
- Turn around.

26:16.487 --> 26:20.448
Do it now.

26:20.535 --> 26:22.015
Come on, what is this?

26:22.102 --> 26:23.669
- What's going on?
- Get in the car.

26:23.756 --> 26:25.627
Oh, man.

26:27.542 --> 26:29.457
What did I do?

26:33.069 --> 26:34.941
[tire screeching]

26:45.473 --> 26:47.475
We know you work
for Tommy Volker.

26:47.562 --> 26:49.346
You were working for him
the day that you

26:49.433 --> 26:52.611
and Charles Milk murdered
Horatio Jones.

26:52.698 --> 26:54.134
Volker was there,
wasn't he?

26:54.221 --> 26:56.223
I don't know what
you're talking about.

26:56.310 --> 27:01.097
We can help you, but you're
gonna have to work with us.

27:01.184 --> 27:03.883
Something just
occurred to me.

27:03.970 --> 27:05.841
You haven't asked
for a lawyer.

27:05.928 --> 27:07.408
'Why?'

27:07.495 --> 27:09.802
A man in your vocation, wouldn't
that be second nature?

27:09.889 --> 27:13.109
Only guilty men
need lawyers.

27:13.196 --> 27:15.068
Nice try,
but that's not it.

27:15.155 --> 27:16.373
We'll go back to that.

27:16.460 --> 27:18.549
I just want to run
a theory by you.

27:18.637 --> 27:22.510
You see, we know someone
saw you kill Jones.

27:23.554 --> 27:25.469
A boy.

27:27.210 --> 27:29.212
Marvin. He saw what
you did, didn't he?

27:31.606 --> 27:33.695
Yes.

27:33.782 --> 27:35.654
So you killed him.

27:40.136 --> 27:42.008
I would never
kill a child.

27:44.010 --> 27:46.534
No, you wouldn't.

27:46.621 --> 27:48.841
You didn't choose this life,
you were forced into it.

27:48.928 --> 27:50.364
A ward of the state
with no options.

27:50.451 --> 27:52.366
You don't enjoy
what you do.

27:52.453 --> 27:57.240
And you're not a sociopath
like Volker or Charles Milk.

27:57.327 --> 27:59.590
So you let one of them
kill the boy.

28:01.984 --> 28:03.856
- No.
- No?

28:05.945 --> 28:08.687
Unless..

28:08.774 --> 28:10.689
...unless he's
still alive.

28:13.430 --> 28:15.911
He is, isn't he?

28:15.998 --> 28:17.696
You couldn't kill him

28:17.783 --> 28:19.698
but you couldn't let
a witness to a murder

28:19.785 --> 28:22.788
'that you committed,
go free.'

28:22.875 --> 28:25.965
So you took him, you gave him
up to someone you trusted.

28:26.052 --> 28:27.880
The boy would be
safe, and any talk

28:27.967 --> 28:29.795
of murder would
fall on deaf ears.

28:32.623 --> 28:34.843
What did you do
with him, Clyde?

28:34.930 --> 28:36.802
Where is Marvin Pettigrew?

28:40.370 --> 28:43.504
If I talk...I'm a dead man.

28:43.591 --> 28:46.420
If you don't, it's just
a matter of time.

28:46.507 --> 28:49.031
Think about your
situation here.

28:49.118 --> 28:52.687
We are gonna start actively
looking for Marvin Pettigrew.

28:52.774 --> 28:54.863
When Volker finds out
that you let a witness go

28:54.950 --> 28:56.996
a witness that could tie
him to the Jones murder

28:57.083 --> 28:58.693
what do you think
he's gonna do?

28:58.780 --> 29:00.651
You know his methods
better than anyone.

29:04.655 --> 29:06.962
I'm not saying
another word. I..

29:07.049 --> 29:08.050
[coughs]
No.

29:09.791 --> 29:10.705
So what now?

29:10.792 --> 29:12.272
We have to let him go.

29:12.359 --> 29:14.013
Volker will go after him,
just like you said he would.

29:14.100 --> 29:16.058
Yes, but not today.
Volker's not that good.

29:16.145 --> 29:18.017
Ah, and meanwhile, Clyde
will lead us to Marvin.

29:18.104 --> 29:21.411
- Exactly.
- Cold, I like it.

29:21.498 --> 29:23.631
Rigsby.
I'm releasing Clyde.

29:23.718 --> 29:25.067
'Drop him off a
couple of miles away.'

29:25.154 --> 29:26.590
Volker cannot know
he was here.

29:26.677 --> 29:27.766
Sure thing, boss.

29:27.853 --> 29:29.376
Cho, I need you
to tail him.

29:29.463 --> 29:31.291
Maybe he'll lead us
to Marvin Pettigrew.

29:31.378 --> 29:33.293
You got it.

29:43.651 --> 29:45.740
Alright, get down.

29:45.827 --> 29:47.742
My apartment's
half an hour away.

29:48.787 --> 29:50.701
Call a cab.

30:11.766 --> 30:13.681
Yeah, can I have a cab?

30:19.078 --> 30:20.906
Hey.

30:20.993 --> 30:22.733
Oh. Is that diet?

30:22.821 --> 30:24.561
Yeah.

30:24.648 --> 30:26.433
Mm.

30:26.520 --> 30:27.913
Ugh.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.218
It's like a week old.

30:29.305 --> 30:30.611
Why didn't you tell me?

30:30.698 --> 30:31.655
You didn't ask.

30:34.658 --> 30:36.573
[phone rings]

30:43.102 --> 30:44.930
Hello.

30:45.017 --> 30:46.888
How is Agent Lisbon today?

30:48.498 --> 30:50.370
I don't know
what you're talking about.

30:53.503 --> 30:57.812
Clyde...you're lying to me.

30:59.335 --> 31:01.207
'You're a dead man.'

31:05.254 --> 31:07.387
What's he doing?

31:07.474 --> 31:09.345
I don't know.

31:17.440 --> 31:19.312
[tire screeching]

31:20.661 --> 31:22.576
[indistinct chattering]

31:25.013 --> 31:26.885
You said there was
something else.

31:30.845 --> 31:32.934
Yes.

31:33.021 --> 31:34.893
But..

31:38.897 --> 31:41.029
There's no need to be
worried about it, Brenda.

31:43.771 --> 31:45.642
- What is it?
- Please don't make me do this.

31:47.688 --> 31:50.343
Make you?

31:50.430 --> 31:52.562
You entered into this
relationship willingly.

31:52.649 --> 31:55.087
Not this.

31:55.174 --> 31:57.045
I didn't agree to this.

31:57.132 --> 31:59.004
Give me the envelope.

32:14.497 --> 32:15.934
Who is he?

32:16.021 --> 32:18.066
They think he's a witness
to Jones' murder.

32:23.506 --> 32:25.073
[sighs]
Where is he?

32:25.160 --> 32:27.032
I don't know.

32:32.646 --> 32:34.604
I said..

32:34.691 --> 32:35.692
...where is he?

32:35.779 --> 32:37.651
I don't know. I swear.

32:47.835 --> 32:50.229
Mr. Costa..

32:50.316 --> 32:52.187
...I have a job for you.

32:57.671 --> 32:58.933
Did he say anything?

32:59.020 --> 33:00.065
No, he made a call,
dropped his cell

33:00.152 --> 33:01.414
and walked into the street.

33:01.501 --> 33:02.676
Last call was
from Volker's office.

33:02.763 --> 33:04.199
We need to find the boy.

33:04.286 --> 33:05.940
And we need to hurry.
Volker knows about him.

33:06.027 --> 33:07.507
How, you think
Clyde told him?

33:07.594 --> 33:08.856
Someone is feeding
Volker information.

33:08.943 --> 33:10.292
- Yeah, but who?
- I'm not sure.

33:10.379 --> 33:11.728
But that's how he knew
about Annabelle

33:11.815 --> 33:13.426
and the search warrant
for VNX Energy.

33:13.513 --> 33:14.862
And it's how he
knew about Clyde.

33:14.949 --> 33:15.994
It's only a matter
of time before

33:16.081 --> 33:17.560
he finds Marvin.

33:22.739 --> 33:24.959
Van Pelt, did you get a printout
of Clyde's cell phone contacts?

33:25.046 --> 33:26.395
Yeah, right here.

33:26.482 --> 33:28.136
Alright, here's how
we're gonna do this

33:28.223 --> 33:29.877
we'll split up the
list, and see if we can

33:29.964 --> 33:31.444
figure out who Clyde
left the boy with.

33:31.531 --> 33:33.750
We'll need background
checks on everyone.

33:33.837 --> 33:36.101
It'll be someone close to Clyde,
but not immediate family

33:36.188 --> 33:38.538
a cousin, a childhood friend,
ex-girlfriend.

33:38.625 --> 33:41.062
Most likely a woman that doesn't
have children of her own

33:41.149 --> 33:43.325
somewhere between
the age of 25 and 50.

33:43.412 --> 33:44.979
And someone who'd
want to be a mother.

33:45.066 --> 33:46.328
- Exactly.
- Alright.

33:46.415 --> 33:48.287
We're on a clock
let's move.

34:20.188 --> 34:21.363
I think I got something.

34:21.450 --> 34:23.191
Anita Doty, 33.

34:23.278 --> 34:24.932
'She's the ex-wife
of Clyde's brother.'

34:25.019 --> 34:26.325
'She has an arrest
for check kiting.'

34:26.412 --> 34:28.066
She's single,
no dependents.

34:28.153 --> 34:29.980
Clyde sent her money
last month, $500.

34:30.068 --> 34:31.112
Mm. That's her.

34:31.199 --> 34:32.331
Do we have an address?

34:32.418 --> 34:34.724
225-B Cedar Street
in Hayward.

34:34.811 --> 34:36.552
Alright, if we can find
her, so can Volker.

34:36.639 --> 34:38.032
Cho, Rigsby, let's go.

34:38.119 --> 34:40.034
Yep, right behind you.

34:46.997 --> 34:50.131
It's apartment B...
upstairs.

34:53.613 --> 34:55.484
What's this?

34:56.616 --> 34:58.487
That's the job.

35:01.751 --> 35:04.014
What do you want me
to do with him?

35:05.494 --> 35:07.235
What do you think?

35:07.322 --> 35:08.541
I can't do that.

35:08.628 --> 35:10.195
What do you mean?

35:10.282 --> 35:11.761
Get up there now.

35:11.848 --> 35:14.024
No. Sorry. No kids.

35:14.112 --> 35:15.374
I never killed a kid.

35:15.461 --> 35:17.332
I'm not starting now.

35:20.857 --> 35:24.470
I will bury you
for this, you hear me?

35:24.557 --> 35:26.385
You do what you have to.

35:26.472 --> 35:28.343
But I'm not killing
a little kid.

36:12.082 --> 36:13.040
[grunts]

37:00.957 --> 37:02.220
[phone rings]

37:02.307 --> 37:03.264
Hey, Cho. What's up?

37:03.351 --> 37:04.787
'We're at the apartment.'

37:04.874 --> 37:06.398
No one's here, but
the door's broken open.

37:06.485 --> 37:08.008
There are signs
of a struggle.

37:08.095 --> 37:09.531
Do you think he took Marvin?

37:09.618 --> 37:11.054
Can't be sure.

37:11.141 --> 37:13.056
Damn it.

37:19.411 --> 37:21.500
Cho.

37:21.587 --> 37:23.023
- Hang on a second.
- Check this out.

37:26.983 --> 37:28.115
Boss, I don't think
Volker has him.

37:28.202 --> 37:29.551
Why?

37:29.638 --> 37:30.683
Because Marvin's on
a school field trip.

37:30.770 --> 37:32.250
He's at the City Zoo.

37:32.337 --> 37:35.035
Get Oakland PD there.
We're on our way.

37:36.036 --> 37:37.907
[indistinct chattering]

37:49.310 --> 37:51.747
Hey, Marvin?

37:51.834 --> 37:53.706
Marvin Pettigrew?

38:00.495 --> 38:01.627
[tires screeching]

38:15.293 --> 38:16.685
I'm with her!

38:16.772 --> 38:18.208
You see him?

38:18.296 --> 38:20.210
No.

38:53.069 --> 38:54.288
Marvin?

38:55.811 --> 38:56.899
'Marvin Pettigrew?'

39:04.603 --> 39:06.605
It's, uh...it's okay.

39:06.692 --> 39:08.041
I-I need you to come
with me, Marvin.

39:08.128 --> 39:10.304
I'm gonna-I'm gonna take
you to see your mother.

39:10.391 --> 39:13.133
But Anita said that
my mother was dead.

39:13.220 --> 39:15.962
No, no.
That's-that's-that's not true.

39:16.049 --> 39:17.529
I'm gonna-I'm gonna
take you to see her.

39:17.616 --> 39:18.834
'Just come with me.'

39:20.532 --> 39:21.707
Come with me, Marvin.

39:23.361 --> 39:24.318
Come here.

39:24.405 --> 39:26.233
- Let go of me.
- Come here.

39:26.320 --> 39:27.539
- Let go.
- Shut up.

39:33.022 --> 39:35.460
- 'Help!'
- It's Volker. He's here.

39:35.547 --> 39:37.418
'Help!'

39:43.990 --> 39:45.557
[animals chattering]

39:45.644 --> 39:47.733
- Shut up, kid!
- Help! Help!

39:47.820 --> 39:49.952
- 'Hey, what you doing?'
- 'Leave me!'

39:50.039 --> 39:52.564
[female #1]
'Hey, let go of that kid!'

39:52.651 --> 39:54.522
Hey!

40:03.618 --> 40:04.750
'Drop it.'

40:04.837 --> 40:05.794
[gunshot]

40:07.883 --> 40:08.928
Lisbon, you alright?

40:09.015 --> 40:10.408
- Yeah, I'm alright.
