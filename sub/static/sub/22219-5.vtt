37:20.534 --> 37:22.735
<b>or do you feel that</b>
<b>you're unjustly here?</b>

37:22.736 --> 37:24.737
<b>- I think it was legible.</b>
<b>You can see what it is.</b>

37:24.738 --> 37:27.406
<b>- It's definitely legible,</b>
<b>but legibility aside,</b>

37:27.407 --> 37:29.475
<b>I still think</b>

37:29.476 --> 37:31.310
<b> <i>You've got a lot of areas</i> </b>

37:43.657 --> 37:45.491

37:45.492 --> 37:46.926
<b>for those kind of issues now...</b>

37:46.927 --> 37:49.395
<b>- Just doing a realistic flower,</b>
<b>a traditional flower.</b>

37:49.396 --> 37:51.764
<b>It's just the concept of</b>

<b>- Technically you might have</b>
<b>the most solid tattoo down here,</b>

38:10.250 --> 38:12.852
