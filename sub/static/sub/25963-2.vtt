WEBVTT

00:02.045 --> 00:03.394
Previously on "Mr. Mercedes"...

00:03.438 --> 00:05.198
Mayor I'm here to introduce
a special young man.

00:05.222 --> 00:07.113
He's the first in a generation
to get into Harvard.

00:07.137 --> 00:07.964
Brady?

00:08.007 --> 00:09.009
Wait, wait!

00:09.835 --> 00:10.793
Montez Tony Montez.

00:10.836 --> 00:12.186
I run the D.A.'s homicide unit.

00:12.229 --> 00:14.149
Am I gonna be able to prosecute
Brady Hartsfield?

00:14.188 --> 00:15.382
Dr. Babineau
Not at this juncture.

00:15.406 --> 00:16.451
Sadie? Honey, you okay?

00:16.494 --> 00:17.191
Did you take your meds
this morning?

00:17.234 --> 00:18.801
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

00:18.844 --> 00:20.039
There've been no changes
on the EEG,

00:20.063 --> 00:21.325
no signs of mental activity.

00:21.369 --> 00:22.805
Hartsfield is bad PR.

00:22.848 --> 00:24.783
He goes to Crestmore as soon
as a bed becomes available.

00:24.807 --> 00:25.721
They're gonna move Hartsfield.

00:25.764 --> 00:26.872
There's nothing else I can do.

00:26.896 --> 00:29.203
Yes, there is,
and it's now or never.

00:29.246 --> 00:31.683
He's the most reviled man
in the history of this town.

00:31.727 --> 00:34.208
You need to give him
the full dose.

00:34.251 --> 00:35.861
Shit!

00:35.905 --> 00:37.361
Hodges
After my heart attack last year,

00:37.385 --> 00:40.388
the first face I saw when I woke
in hospital was his.

00:40.431 --> 00:41.606
I did come see you.

00:41.650 --> 00:42.433
And never come back?

00:42.477 --> 00:44.044
It's complicated.

00:44.087 --> 00:46.307
Those people you ran over
standing in line for a job...

00:46.350 --> 00:47.917
Three years in the grave.

00:47.960 --> 00:50.093
But, you, you're still ticking.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:11.756 --> 03:14.803
Hey. Hey!

03:14.846 --> 03:15.630
Fuck.

03:15.673 --> 03:17.371
Hey!

03:17.414 --> 03:19.242
Yeah. I know this
probably looks bad...

03:19.286 --> 03:21.157
I'm calling the fucking police.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.115
Well, you go right ahead.

03:23.159 --> 03:24.900
I hate to be the bearer
of bad tidings,

03:24.943 --> 03:27.119
but as an ex member
of the force myself,

03:27.163 --> 03:30.601
I can assure you that police
have more pressing engagements

03:30.645 --> 03:33.952
than motor vehicle
repossessions.

03:33.996 --> 03:37.086
What? That's what you're doing
here, repossessing my car?

03:37.129 --> 03:40.829
It seems we live in
a consumer-driven economy...

03:40.872 --> 03:42.961
If the consumer don't pay,
she don't drive.

03:43.005 --> 03:45.094
Okay, look, all right,
I am begging you.

03:45.137 --> 03:47.401
I have a job interview today.
Of all the days.

03:47.444 --> 03:50.273
I do sympathize,
but when you signed that lease,

03:50.317 --> 03:51.492
you vowed to pay it.

03:51.535 --> 03:53.102
When I took this job,
I vowed to do it,

03:53.145 --> 03:54.582
so you're out of luck
on this one.

03:54.625 --> 03:55.539
Well, I-I have a kid.

03:55.583 --> 03:56.627
I'm a single mom.

03:56.671 --> 03:58.107
You're making this hard now.

03:58.150 --> 04:00.457
You ugly fat fuck.

04:00.501 --> 04:02.894
Okay. Less hard.

04:07.421 --> 04:09.336
Okay, wait.
Wait, wait, wait. No!

04:09.379 --> 04:10.206
Listen, I'm sorry I yelled!

04:10.250 --> 04:11.468
I'm sorry.

04:11.512 --> 04:12.643
Sorry that I yelled!

04:12.687 --> 04:14.906
Please! Wait!

04:14.950 --> 04:16.733
Real quick... Can you just...
I can't...

04:16.778 --> 04:17.692
Please!

04:17.735 --> 04:19.015
Can you at least give me
a ride?!

04:19.041 --> 04:20.564
I'm sorry that I yelled!

04:20.608 --> 04:22.697
Wait! No, wait, wait! Wait!

04:22.740 --> 04:25.569
Fuck me up the arse.

06:06.496 --> 06:09.586
I mean, what?

06:09.630 --> 06:13.111
My girl, Tonya T, at St. Joe's,
she got an iPad.

06:13.155 --> 06:15.244
We get this downmarket bullshit?

06:15.287 --> 06:18.073
First, watch the language.

06:18.116 --> 06:20.249
And, second,
if these devices help you two

06:20.292 --> 06:22.425
with your math proofs,

06:22.469 --> 06:23.794
I will personally write a letter
of thanks

06:23.818 --> 06:25.776
to the company
that donated them.

06:30.651 --> 06:32.957
But you're right, they...
They are pretty crappy.

06:46.318 --> 06:48.364
Hi. Hi, Al.

07:19.439 --> 07:22.006
Where are we, Sadie?

07:26.228 --> 07:29.449
It's Sadie Sadie married lady.

07:29.492 --> 07:32.060
Bow when I go by.

07:38.936 --> 07:41.286
Fanny Brice, "Funny Girl."

07:41.330 --> 07:43.158
You are getting good!

07:44.681 --> 07:46.378
I haven't stumped you in a week.

07:55.431 --> 07:56.650
Holly Hi.

07:56.693 --> 07:58.913
I have truly wonderful news.

08:01.568 --> 08:03.308
Okay.

08:03.352 --> 08:05.746
What's this?

08:05.789 --> 08:07.922
It was in the car I just repo'd.

08:07.965 --> 08:09.552
It'll have to be brought
back to the owner

08:09.576 --> 08:11.684
unless she's failed to make
payments on that, as well.

08:11.708 --> 08:13.405
Well I don't think anyone

08:13.449 --> 08:16.452
can actually take out a loan
to buy a car seat.

08:20.804 --> 08:23.807
Holly, I did not get
into this business

08:23.851 --> 08:28.377
to repossess the possessions
of poor people.

08:28.420 --> 08:30.205
I know, but sometimes
that is the job.

08:30.248 --> 08:32.424
Well, then you can do it
next time, 'cause I ain't.

08:32.467 --> 08:34.644
Okay. I'll be happy to.

08:34.688 --> 08:37.385
Right, well, start by returning
that to Karen Williams, okay?

08:37.429 --> 08:39.214
I will. I will.

08:42.043 --> 08:45.046
Well, of course you can sue,
but you won't win.

08:45.089 --> 08:46.589
No. No, no. There's...
There's such a thing

08:46.613 --> 08:49.441
as a Statute of Frauds which,
loosely translated,

08:49.485 --> 08:52.270
means oral promises
from the landlord

08:52.314 --> 08:54.316
won't carry the day.

08:54.359 --> 08:56.144
Yeah. Okay.

09:08.243 --> 09:11.551
Babies.

09:14.989 --> 09:17.731
Can I now share
my wonderful news?

09:17.774 --> 09:20.777
I'm all ears.

09:20.821 --> 09:22.866
Marian Natches is about to die.

09:22.910 --> 09:24.694
Um, that's not
the wonderful part.

09:24.738 --> 09:27.175
It is, in fact,
extremely tragic,

09:27.218 --> 09:28.916
as is the loss
of any human life...

09:28.959 --> 09:30.918
but what's wonderful
is that Marian Natches

09:30.961 --> 09:34.835
is David De La Cruz's mother.

09:34.878 --> 09:36.314
Bill?

09:36.358 --> 09:37.620
And why do I care?

09:37.664 --> 09:39.448
You care because
David De La Cruz is the man

09:39.491 --> 09:41.145
that we have to deliver
to Federal Court.

09:41.189 --> 09:44.409
Without his testimony,
some terrifying men go free.

09:44.453 --> 09:46.586
Yeah? How terrifying?

09:48.718 --> 09:51.199
Look.

09:52.940 --> 09:55.420
Murder, extortion,
drug trafficking.

09:55.464 --> 09:56.857
Okay, pretty terrifying.

09:56.900 --> 10:00.687
Yeah, and De La Cruz got caught
driving their drugs.

10:00.730 --> 10:04.299
Okay, so he used
that stolen credit card

10:04.342 --> 10:05.996
to buy a casket in Lewiston,

10:06.040 --> 10:07.607
and as long as his mother
is hanging on,

10:07.650 --> 10:10.522
I figure he's likely to remain
within the jurisdiction.

10:10.566 --> 10:13.308
Sons who buy their mothers'
caskets would, I imagine,

10:13.351 --> 10:14.788
stick around to go
to the funeral.

10:14.831 --> 10:18.487
Speaking of sons,
he has two of them...

10:18.530 --> 10:22.839
Victor and Miguel,
ages six and eight.

10:22.883 --> 10:24.406
Mother is deceased,

10:24.449 --> 10:29.106
and he pulled them out of school
two weeks ago.

10:29.150 --> 10:31.848
Right, this shit took his
two sons on the run with him?

10:31.892 --> 10:33.720
Yeah.

10:33.763 --> 10:36.374
Okay.

10:36.418 --> 10:38.594
We got any theme parks nearby?

10:38.638 --> 10:39.813
What?

10:39.856 --> 10:42.337
You know, theme parks are...

10:42.380 --> 10:44.774
He's hiding out
with two kids in tow.

10:44.818 --> 10:48.473
Yeah. Um, there's
Cedar Point in Sandusky,

10:48.517 --> 10:51.085
but, um, they're too small
for that. But, um...

10:51.128 --> 10:52.715
All right, just...
Just make me a list, will ya,

10:52.739 --> 10:54.566
of all
the kid-friendly nuisances

10:54.610 --> 10:57.004
within a 50-mile radius
of the hospice.

10:57.047 --> 10:59.484
Okay. On it.

10:59.528 --> 11:01.288
Lawrence Yeah, who else
around here can say that,

11:01.312 --> 11:04.707
straight A's at Harvard?

11:04.751 --> 11:06.511
You know you don't have to
do this, right, Dad?

11:06.535 --> 11:08.450
You're right. I don't.

11:08.493 --> 11:12.672
But I want to celebrate my son
coming home from school.

11:14.456 --> 11:16.501
Can't wait to see you, kid.

11:16.545 --> 11:17.740
What are you doing
on the phone, anyway?

11:17.764 --> 11:18.852
I thought I told you...

11:18.895 --> 11:20.220
Thought I told you
not to be talking

11:20.244 --> 11:21.202
while you're driving, right?

11:21.245 --> 11:23.334
Yeah, okay.

11:49.578 --> 11:52.581
I'm gonna give you
a sponge bath.

11:52.624 --> 11:54.931
I made the water nice and warm,

11:54.975 --> 11:57.891
the way you like it.

11:57.934 --> 12:00.720
Okay.

12:00.763 --> 12:02.765
I'm being careful
around this guy.

12:02.809 --> 12:03.940
Don't worry.

12:31.707 --> 12:34.101
Did you not do your... Come on.

12:36.320 --> 12:41.151
Come on, a little more
mobilization.

12:41.195 --> 12:43.893
Tomorrow, I think
you're gonna feel better.

12:43.937 --> 12:45.808
There we go.

12:45.852 --> 12:47.854
One more.

12:47.897 --> 12:49.464
Good.

12:49.507 --> 12:52.728
All right, let's get this
stinky arm of yours.

12:52.772 --> 12:55.862
Up.

12:55.905 --> 12:57.646
Come on.

12:57.689 --> 13:00.301
There we go.

13:00.344 --> 13:04.871
I know you like pointing
over there.

13:04.914 --> 13:08.265
There we go...
Between your fingers.

13:14.706 --> 13:17.666
Okay, good.

13:17.709 --> 13:21.844
Very pretty day today, Brady.

13:21.888 --> 13:23.672
Looking good...
Numbers are looking g...

15:17.351 --> 15:18.439
I know what I saw.

15:18.482 --> 15:19.701
He's alive.

15:19.744 --> 15:20.789
Yes, we know he's alive.

15:20.832 --> 15:21.853
We tend not to tube
the dead ones.

15:21.877 --> 15:23.096
No, I mean alive, alive.

15:23.139 --> 15:24.097
He was looking at me.

15:24.140 --> 15:25.707
He was conscious.

15:25.750 --> 15:27.448
That's not possible.

15:27.491 --> 15:30.842
Wait, h... his brain activity
is spiking.

15:30.886 --> 15:32.124
It could simply be an anomaly.
It doesn't mean that he's...

15:32.148 --> 15:33.560
An anomaly that just happened
to coincide

15:33.584 --> 15:35.108
with him looking at her?

15:36.761 --> 15:39.199
You put her up to this
so we wouldn't move him?

15:39.242 --> 15:43.072
Jesus, Pettimore,
even his heart rate's elevated.

15:43.116 --> 15:45.770
The only thing you see in him
is your own celebrity, Felix.

15:47.381 --> 15:48.880
The amount of cash spent
on one criminal

15:48.904 --> 15:50.012
just cost us
a drug treatment program

15:50.036 --> 15:51.907
that was helping hundreds.

15:56.607 --> 15:58.653
His beta levels are that
of a conscious mind.

16:10.056 --> 16:12.232
I've never seen this before.

16:12.275 --> 16:13.973
No one has.

16:23.069 --> 16:24.592
I think he's in there.

16:31.164 --> 16:32.730
The fuck?

16:32.774 --> 16:33.949
What just happened?

16:33.993 --> 16:35.646
I-I don't know.

16:37.126 --> 16:38.606
His waves are slowing.

16:38.649 --> 16:41.130
I am telling you,
I saw consciousness.

16:41.174 --> 16:43.089
Okay, quantify that.

16:43.132 --> 16:45.352
Did he smile? Did he blink?
Did he vocalize?

16:45.395 --> 16:47.156
I've worked with vegetative
patients for six years.

16:47.180 --> 16:48.790
I can tell the difference.

16:48.833 --> 16:51.445
He's in there.

16:51.488 --> 16:52.794
Okay.

16:52.837 --> 16:55.188
Until this happens a second
time, it's a glitch.

16:55.231 --> 16:57.059
Nobody say a word about this.

17:15.121 --> 17:18.211
Mister, you got any quarters?

17:18.253 --> 17:19.255
Beg your pardon?

17:19.299 --> 17:21.823
I really need a quarter.

17:21.866 --> 17:23.738
What you need is a napkin.

17:23.781 --> 17:25.261
Douche.

17:26.654 --> 17:28.743
Douche yourself.

17:53.159 --> 17:55.509
I need a goddamn cigarette.

18:06.346 --> 18:08.174
Taking a break?

18:08.217 --> 18:11.002
Yeah, trying to.

18:13.222 --> 18:14.528
Mind if I ask you something?

18:14.571 --> 18:15.659
You working here long?

18:15.703 --> 18:17.661
Yeah. Too long.

18:17.705 --> 18:21.665
You seen these two kids
coming in here at all?

18:21.709 --> 18:24.886
They look,
kind of familiar, I guess.

18:24.929 --> 18:26.249
I don't know.
If I recognize them,

18:26.279 --> 18:28.083
then they've probably been
in here more than once.

18:28.107 --> 18:29.151
You sure?

18:29.195 --> 18:32.154
Am I sure? No.

18:32.198 --> 18:34.200
All these kids look alike,
truth be told.

18:34.243 --> 18:36.767
Plus I can't see shit
through that mask.

18:36.811 --> 18:38.900
I actually try not to look
at the little bastards.

18:38.943 --> 18:42.121
Most are overstimulated
glucose addicts.

18:42.164 --> 18:43.122
So, which is it?

18:43.165 --> 18:47.038
Did you see them or not?

18:47.082 --> 18:51.652
I'd say a hard probably.

18:51.695 --> 18:54.089
You've seen one,
you've seen 'em all, right?

18:54.133 --> 18:57.962
So, is this your job,
tracking down little kids?

19:00.139 --> 19:03.054
You mean to compare careers?

19:09.409 --> 19:10.497
So, what happened in there?

19:10.540 --> 19:12.760
Absolutely nothing.

19:12.803 --> 19:14.457
Pettimore and Babineau
both showed up

19:14.501 --> 19:15.893
for "absolutely nothing"?

19:15.937 --> 19:18.287
- Yeah.
- Sadie.

19:18.331 --> 19:20.898
What? I've played poker with you.

19:20.942 --> 19:22.702
You're the one with no chips
an hour into the night.

19:22.726 --> 19:24.859
Nothing happened.

19:31.866 --> 19:33.911
He looked right at me.

19:33.955 --> 19:35.870
What?

19:35.913 --> 19:38.394
Hartsfield.

19:38.438 --> 19:43.007
He looked right at me.

19:43.051 --> 19:44.444
Shut up.

19:44.487 --> 19:45.880
Don't tell anyone, okay?

19:45.923 --> 19:47.553
Pettimore will flip his shit
if this gets out.

19:47.577 --> 19:50.624
Course not, honey...
Lips sealed.

19:50.667 --> 19:52.278
He gives me the creeps.

19:52.321 --> 19:54.715
He does that to everybody,
sweetie.

20:03.724 --> 20:06.596
Nancy,
you're not gonna believe this.

20:20.567 --> 20:21.307
Hodges Yeah?

20:21.350 --> 20:23.134
Any luck?

20:23.178 --> 20:26.268
Yeah, I got a "hard probably"
from a man who dresses as a pig.

20:26.312 --> 20:28.270
O-On purpose?

20:28.314 --> 20:29.706
It would appear so.

20:29.750 --> 20:31.142
Um, okay.

20:31.186 --> 20:33.014
I'd check the water park next.

20:33.057 --> 20:34.145
I mean, it's not too...

20:38.324 --> 20:40.064
Bill?

20:40.108 --> 20:41.501
Hello? Bill?

20:45.505 --> 20:47.420
Holly? Holly?

20:47.463 --> 20:49.987
Are there any camp grounds
around here?

20:54.557 --> 20:55.795
Girl
You're never gonna catch me!

20:55.819 --> 20:57.908
I'm almost there!

20:57.952 --> 20:59.345
Look at that one!

20:59.388 --> 21:02.652
Watch out for that fire pit!

21:02.696 --> 21:03.958
Where's Ryan?

21:22.716 --> 21:24.805
Don't even think about it.

21:26.285 --> 21:28.287
Please. I'm begging you.

21:28.330 --> 21:29.026
I get that a lot.

21:29.070 --> 21:30.114
Dad?

21:30.158 --> 21:31.377
It's okay.

21:31.420 --> 21:33.117
What's going on?

21:33.161 --> 21:35.511
Stay here.

21:35.555 --> 21:37.208
You have a date in court,
Mr. De La Cruz.

21:37.252 --> 21:38.819
I'm your escort.

21:38.862 --> 21:41.387
Do you know the facts
about the case?

21:41.430 --> 21:42.581
You know, if you'd done
your homework,

21:42.605 --> 21:44.868
you know I don't got a record
before this.

21:44.912 --> 21:47.349
I'm not in the drug business.

21:47.393 --> 21:50.047
I was a courier. Period.

21:50.091 --> 21:52.659
I had no idea
I was delivering narcotics.

21:52.702 --> 21:54.051
Do I look like a judge to you?

21:54.095 --> 21:55.531
You look like a human being.

21:55.575 --> 21:56.663
Don't be fooled.

21:56.706 --> 21:58.578
Maybe even a dad.

22:02.973 --> 22:05.802
Look, if you bring me in,
I'm a dead man.

22:05.846 --> 22:06.953
The government either
locks me up

22:06.977 --> 22:08.477
or the cartel kills me
for cooperating.

22:08.501 --> 22:10.720
Victor Dad!

22:18.554 --> 22:21.818
They're looking
for you in the South...

22:21.862 --> 22:24.168
Also the entire
Eastern Seaboard.

22:24.212 --> 22:27.868
My advice, go west and burn
that stolen credit card.

22:27.911 --> 22:29.236
Don't be waiting
for your mother to die.

22:29.260 --> 22:31.001
They're all over it.

22:32.002 --> 22:34.091
Thank you.

22:36.964 --> 22:39.488
Just remember where you were
five months ago.

22:39.532 --> 22:41.882
Deep.

22:41.925 --> 22:43.274
That's good.

22:43.318 --> 22:45.929
Deep stretch.

22:48.410 --> 22:51.239
Come this way.

22:51.282 --> 22:53.284
That's really good.

22:53.328 --> 22:56.113
That's really, really good.

22:56.157 --> 22:57.854
All right.

22:57.898 --> 22:59.856
Back to center.

23:00.988 --> 23:01.988
You got that.

23:02.772 --> 23:04.731
Amazing!

23:04.774 --> 23:06.080
That was awesome.

23:06.123 --> 23:07.429
Yeah.

23:07.473 --> 23:10.084
Yeah, right. Well done, dude.

23:12.173 --> 23:14.001
Man Hey, you hear
Hartsfield woke up?

23:14.044 --> 23:15.263
He's not in a coma anymore.

23:15.306 --> 23:16.569
Woman How? Really?

23:16.612 --> 23:17.918
Who knows where this could lead?

23:17.961 --> 23:19.789
Trial-of-the-Century shit, yo.

23:19.833 --> 23:21.661
Wait, what? Is that guy serious?

23:21.704 --> 23:23.010
No.

23:23.053 --> 23:24.683
I-I heard he had, like,
a tiny spike in his EEG.

23:24.707 --> 23:26.187
That's it.

23:26.230 --> 23:27.014
Don't listen to him.

23:27.057 --> 23:28.668
Come on.

23:28.711 --> 23:29.973
Focus.

23:34.456 --> 23:37.198
I mean, Sadie's a bit off, but
she never stuck me as a liar.

23:37.241 --> 23:38.634
Well, she's adamant.

23:38.678 --> 23:40.027
I have no reason to doubt her.

23:40.070 --> 23:42.812
And you definitely saw activity
on the EEG?

23:42.856 --> 23:44.858
He's barely been delta
this whole time.

23:44.901 --> 23:46.468
Today he went to beta.

23:47.861 --> 23:49.819
Fucking Pettimore
still has a hard-on

23:49.863 --> 23:51.342
to transfer him to Crestmore.

23:51.386 --> 23:54.128
You cannot
let him get transferred.

23:56.478 --> 23:57.914
What about Montez?

23:57.958 --> 24:00.264
He's desperate to try
Hartsfield, right?

24:00.308 --> 24:04.138
He can't do that unless the
defendant regains consciousness.

24:04.181 --> 24:05.531
That's true.

24:07.315 --> 24:08.795
So convince Montez
there's a chance

24:08.838 --> 24:11.711
as long as Brady
continues treatment.

24:11.754 --> 24:14.322
I don't know. Maybe he can
apply some influence.

24:23.549 --> 24:26.856
So, you've gone a little soft.

24:26.900 --> 24:29.206
It's not the worst thing.

24:29.250 --> 24:33.123
It is for a skip-tracer.

24:33.167 --> 24:37.476
Come on, we just opened
the office eight months ago.

24:37.519 --> 24:41.349
See, you know, I got people
relying on me, you know?

24:41.392 --> 24:43.525
Yeah, and by people,
you mean Holly?

24:43.569 --> 24:45.396
Yeah.
She could have a future in it.

24:45.440 --> 24:47.311
She's really good.

24:47.355 --> 24:51.925
But I have to be there
to teach her the ropes, right?

24:51.968 --> 24:54.710
Bill, you were a good cop.

24:54.754 --> 24:57.974
Chasing bad guys,
that's your thing.

24:58.018 --> 25:00.673
Preying on...
On people down on their luck...

25:00.716 --> 25:03.676
Not your thing.

25:03.719 --> 25:04.938
I know.

25:07.810 --> 25:09.856
What?

25:09.899 --> 25:11.422
I think I've reached that stage.

25:11.466 --> 25:13.120
What stage?

25:13.163 --> 25:17.080
The stage that comes after
keeling over from a heart attack

25:17.124 --> 25:19.518
and seeing your best friend
dropping dead of one...

25:19.561 --> 25:21.215
That stage.

25:21.258 --> 25:23.173
I've lost me moorings a bit.

25:28.614 --> 25:31.965
You don't need to work.

25:32.008 --> 25:35.621
Is it about making money?

25:35.664 --> 25:40.321
I need to be of value, and my
job gave me that, you know?

25:40.364 --> 25:43.454
Okay, Brady gave me that.

25:43.498 --> 25:45.152
Also gave you a heart attack.

25:45.195 --> 25:47.284
Yeah.

25:47.328 --> 25:49.983
Why don't you simply enjoy life?

25:50.026 --> 25:54.988
Just stop worrying
about finding the value in it.

26:00.689 --> 26:03.039
What if I'm not built for that?

26:05.389 --> 26:07.391
Thought about a hobby?

26:07.435 --> 26:09.306
Gazebo building?

26:09.350 --> 26:12.483
Okay.

26:12.527 --> 26:16.313
I do like the odd jigsaw.

26:16.357 --> 26:18.794
I was thinking
of embroidery maybe.

26:22.972 --> 26:25.279
Maybe you could
teach me something.

26:31.067 --> 26:32.895
Billy...

26:52.175 --> 26:53.524
Just settle up?

26:53.568 --> 26:55.222
Yeah.

26:58.007 --> 27:00.793
Brace yourself...
He's not a pretty sight.

27:00.836 --> 27:03.056
Have you ever seen
any of his victims?

27:03.099 --> 27:04.492
No, I didn't work here then.

27:04.535 --> 27:08.714
I have, every single one...
Including the infant.

27:08.757 --> 27:10.367
Shit.

27:10.411 --> 27:11.238
Told you he'd be lurking.

27:11.281 --> 27:13.370
Watch this. Jon!

27:14.458 --> 27:15.590
It's Jon, right?

27:15.634 --> 27:16.896
And you're Tony?

27:16.939 --> 27:18.593
That's right. Want a fry?

27:18.637 --> 27:19.812
No, I'm good.

27:19.855 --> 27:21.335
Coming to check on my rock star.

27:21.378 --> 27:24.643
Want to come with us?

27:24.686 --> 27:26.993
So, you guys are making a lot of
progress with this guy?

27:27.036 --> 27:28.255
Hartsfield?

27:28.298 --> 27:29.778
I wouldn't get too excited.

27:29.822 --> 27:31.301
No?

27:31.345 --> 27:33.236
There'd have to be a lot more
data to trump my skepticism.

27:33.260 --> 27:34.629
Dr. Babineau And how are we
supposed to gather that data

27:34.653 --> 27:36.785
if you transfer
the patient, Jon?

27:36.829 --> 27:38.134
Even if Dr. Babineau's

27:38.178 --> 27:39.832
most optimistic projections
proved true,

27:39.875 --> 27:41.592
it could be years before
Hartsfield's fit for trial.

27:41.616 --> 27:43.618
And that's a galactic "if."

27:43.662 --> 27:46.752
Well, luckily,
I'm the soul of patience.

27:46.795 --> 27:48.077
We don't have the money
or the time.

27:48.101 --> 27:50.799
I've made that clear. Hey, man, I hear you.

27:50.843 --> 27:53.454
My unit in the D.A.'s...
You know, Homicide...

27:53.497 --> 27:54.561
We have the biggest budget
of the all the units

27:54.585 --> 27:55.848
and it's still never enough.

27:55.891 --> 27:58.415
And as for time, shit.

27:58.459 --> 27:59.654
Actually, we had to kick the can
down the road

27:59.678 --> 28:01.462
on one of you guys recently.

28:01.505 --> 28:03.725
Um, shit, what's his name?
Lance something-something?

28:03.769 --> 28:05.205
Russo. Dr. Lance Russo.

28:05.248 --> 28:06.554
That's the dude.

28:06.597 --> 28:08.861
Now, the malpractice part
is clear,

28:08.904 --> 28:12.342
but did his actions lead
to criminal negligence?

28:12.386 --> 28:15.389
Did the supervisors know
about it, or the board, right?

28:15.432 --> 28:17.260
Do doctors at Mercy Gen'
get away with murder?

28:17.304 --> 28:19.436
And if they don't,
have they in the past?

28:19.480 --> 28:21.264
Is it isolated or systemic?

28:21.308 --> 28:23.484
See, these are the kinds of
questions that I was asking

28:23.527 --> 28:25.094
before I ran out of time.

28:25.138 --> 28:27.401
Caseload was too heavy.

28:27.444 --> 28:29.925
But if I wasn't waiting around
for Hartsfield,

28:29.969 --> 28:32.754
I'd have all the free time
in the world.

28:32.798 --> 28:34.887
There'd be a fucking feast
of time.

28:40.980 --> 28:42.068
Four weeks.

28:42.111 --> 28:44.810
I'm sorry?

28:44.853 --> 28:46.507
Eight. Eight weeks.

28:46.550 --> 28:48.291
Can't thank you enough, Jon.

28:50.250 --> 28:53.775
Woman on P.A. Dr. Babineau
to 102 for immediate consult.

28:53.819 --> 28:54.970
Dr. Babineau to 102
for immediate consult. You go ahead.

28:54.994 --> 28:57.257
I'll see you in a few minutes.

29:24.458 --> 29:27.156
You in there, my friend?

29:28.244 --> 29:31.595
More than you know.

29:31.639 --> 29:33.380
How do you feel about pain?

29:33.423 --> 29:34.642
How do you I feel about pain?

29:34.685 --> 29:36.905
I don't have feelings,
you prick.

29:41.040 --> 29:42.389
What the fuck?

29:45.435 --> 29:47.655
You dished a lot of it out.

29:47.698 --> 29:50.092
I got to assume
you can take it, right?

29:57.230 --> 29:59.319
What the fuck are you doing?

29:59.362 --> 30:00.755
What the fuck are you doing?

30:00.799 --> 30:02.719
Take your hands off my balls,
you fucking faggot!

30:04.672 --> 30:07.849
If you're not enjoying this...

30:07.893 --> 30:10.678
just say so, my man.

30:10.721 --> 30:12.506
And I'll stop.

30:12.549 --> 30:17.032
I'm paralyzed, you dumb fuck.

30:17.076 --> 30:18.251
Can I feel it?

30:18.294 --> 30:20.166
Can I feel it?

30:20.209 --> 30:21.297
Can I fucking feel it?

30:21.341 --> 30:24.605
Can you feel my dick?

30:24.648 --> 30:26.259
Sorry, Mom, don't be jealous.

30:28.739 --> 30:32.091
My mom used to do that to me
when I was a little boy.

30:32.134 --> 30:34.484
You think I'm scared of you?

30:34.528 --> 30:38.053
Come on. Seize that moment.

30:38.097 --> 30:40.839
Occupandi temporis,
you little bitch.

30:40.882 --> 30:42.101
Seize the moment.

30:42.144 --> 30:44.451
You speak Latin,
you fucking prick?

30:44.494 --> 30:47.062
Squeeze away, motherfucker.

30:47.106 --> 30:49.978
I'm so far away from you

30:50.022 --> 30:52.241
and so much closer
than you'll ever fucking know.

31:14.916 --> 31:16.700
You fucking prick.

31:18.702 --> 31:20.791
I'm gonna get you.

31:32.803 --> 31:34.283
Hey.

31:34.327 --> 31:37.417
Hey.

31:37.460 --> 31:39.245
What?

31:39.288 --> 31:41.682
What?

31:41.725 --> 31:44.467
Dad always let you dress
like that?

31:44.511 --> 31:46.992
Like what?

31:47.035 --> 31:48.950
Like...

31:48.994 --> 31:52.519
I don't know. Not you?

31:52.562 --> 31:56.349
Girl's gotta grow up.

31:56.392 --> 31:58.264
Yeah. That's... That's true.

32:01.789 --> 32:04.139
I-I was kidding. It was a joke.

32:06.533 --> 32:09.057
It's a joke.

32:09.101 --> 32:11.320
Dog, could you tell her
it was a joke, please?

32:11.364 --> 32:13.714
Thank you.

32:22.636 --> 32:23.898
Sadie, you're fine. Go.

32:36.215 --> 32:38.217
Okay.

33:38.364 --> 33:40.105
Come on.

33:42.933 --> 33:44.979
Are you with me?

33:45.023 --> 33:46.546
Sadie?

33:49.027 --> 33:52.160
Come on. Are you with me?

33:58.514 --> 33:59.994
Are you with me, Sadie?

34:19.187 --> 34:20.232
Door.

34:52.655 --> 34:55.005
What we have...

34:55.049 --> 34:56.703
is just between you and me.

35:00.707 --> 35:04.145
You shouldn't have told anyone.

35:04.189 --> 35:07.844
I can't have you running around

35:07.888 --> 35:10.586
blabbing our secrets.

35:13.676 --> 35:14.676
Wow.

35:16.940 --> 35:19.334
Do you realize
how pretty you are, Sadie?

35:19.378 --> 35:22.076
Such a beautiful girl.

35:25.993 --> 35:29.083
Your hair.

35:29.127 --> 35:31.129
Soft hair.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.306
Soft skin.

35:39.137 --> 35:41.182
Your lips.

35:48.450 --> 35:50.148
And your neck.

35:51.497 --> 35:53.368
Your lovely neck.

35:53.412 --> 35:55.196
I kiss your neck, Sadie.

36:39.458 --> 36:42.287
Do you know that
I've never been camping?

36:42.330 --> 36:45.507
Hodges
I wish I could say the same.

36:45.551 --> 36:49.816
Why?
You don't like nature, or...

36:49.859 --> 36:52.297
Well,
not philosophically opposed.

36:52.340 --> 36:53.472
I just prefer toilets.

36:59.347 --> 37:00.740
Tents are very expensive,
you know?

37:00.783 --> 37:02.785
I mean, the high-ends ones
are, anyway.

37:02.829 --> 37:06.876
Like De La Cruz's tent,
his tent cost $499.

37:06.920 --> 37:08.226
I found it online.

37:10.228 --> 37:11.881
So, what are you asking me?

37:11.925 --> 37:13.883
Well, I'm not asking
you anything.

37:13.927 --> 37:17.017
I just, you know, want to make
sure that I have some clarity.

37:17.060 --> 37:18.845
Okay, go on.

37:18.888 --> 37:21.674
Okay, so you
found De La Cruz's tent.

37:21.717 --> 37:23.197
Him and his kids weren't there,

37:23.241 --> 37:25.175
then you talked to the guy
who's camping next to him

37:25.199 --> 37:28.028
who said that De La Cruz
and his kids left for good?

37:28.071 --> 37:31.161
That's pretty much
how it happened, yeah.

37:31.205 --> 37:33.444
I don't see how this guy could
possibly know that De La Cruz

37:33.468 --> 37:36.384
was gone for good, especially
when his tent was still there.

37:36.428 --> 37:39.474
The man is running for his life
with his kids.

37:39.518 --> 37:40.930
Maybe his tent
isn't his top priority.

37:40.954 --> 37:42.999
Anyway,
stolen credit card, right?

37:43.043 --> 37:44.479
I mean, he's not out of pocket.

37:44.523 --> 37:46.307
I mean,
I guess that makes sense.

37:46.351 --> 37:48.048
Wow! Look at this!

37:48.091 --> 37:50.268
They got the color wrong.

37:50.311 --> 37:51.921
It's supposed to be crimson.

37:51.965 --> 37:54.402
Blue for a boy.

37:54.446 --> 37:56.099
It's perfect.

37:56.143 --> 37:58.885
So, if De La Cruz left the
campsite, where do you think...

37:58.928 --> 38:01.844
How 'bout we give this a rest
and go to a party?

38:01.888 --> 38:03.019
Okay. Working day is over.

38:03.063 --> 38:04.891
Don't obsess.

38:04.934 --> 38:06.022
Okay.

38:09.069 --> 38:11.071
But what if there's
another cake?

38:11.114 --> 38:12.701
What? No. What if someone
brought another cake?

38:12.725 --> 38:14.006
Listen, put it down there
if you're embarrassed about it.

38:14.030 --> 38:15.269
It's all right.
Just put it over.

38:15.293 --> 38:16.424
- Just here?
- Yeah.

38:16.468 --> 38:17.991
- There you go. More there?
- Yeah.

38:18.034 --> 38:19.229
Man Keep going. Good.
Good, good, good, good.

38:19.253 --> 38:20.776
It's pink. Kermit!

38:20.820 --> 38:22.561
Hey! There he is.

38:22.604 --> 38:24.214
That's a bit informal, isn't it?

38:24.258 --> 38:25.781
Is the Ivy League no manners?

38:25.825 --> 38:26.845
Okay, that's how you want
to do it,

38:26.869 --> 38:28.567
faux-hostile banter and shit?

38:28.610 --> 38:29.610
Give me a hug!

38:31.396 --> 38:32.764
How you doing, man?
I'm all right.

38:32.788 --> 38:34.442
- I'm all right.
- Look at this.

38:34.486 --> 38:35.854
Yeah. Yeah, what's going on there,
now?

38:35.878 --> 38:36.749
Trying to...
Trying to be like you...

38:36.792 --> 38:38.272
Young detective over here.

38:38.316 --> 38:39.380
Well, you got... It's not...
It's not this white.

38:39.404 --> 38:41.014
Yeah, well, you got
to do better.

38:41.057 --> 38:43.059
Holly! I didn't even see you.Hi.

38:43.103 --> 38:44.583
You look so good.

38:44.626 --> 38:46.280
Thank you. You too.

38:46.324 --> 38:48.238
Um, I got you a cake.

38:48.282 --> 38:50.023
A lot of hugs.

38:50.066 --> 38:51.764
How you doing?
Congratulations, man.

38:51.807 --> 38:53.045
Thank you.
Good to see you.Fantastic.

38:53.069 --> 38:54.462
Um... It's in a box
and everything.

38:54.506 --> 38:56.421
Yeah. So... Okay, so...

38:56.464 --> 38:59.467
I'm excited... it's not exactly right,
but...

39:01.034 --> 39:02.731
It's blue, Holly. I know.

39:02.775 --> 39:04.733
I-I told them that I wanted it
to be crimson.

39:04.777 --> 39:06.213
They made it... Look. Crimson.

39:06.256 --> 39:07.997
I know! I-I...
They messed it up.

39:08.041 --> 39:10.441
I love it so much. Thank you.
I mean, you got the name right.

39:12.219 --> 39:13.742
Has Dr. Babineau left
for the day?

39:13.786 --> 39:16.397
Yep, I saw him go.

39:19.618 --> 39:22.360
Can you watch the desk, hon?
I got to make a quick call.

39:22.403 --> 39:23.926
Betcha.

39:37.244 --> 39:38.550
Enter this for me.

39:38.593 --> 39:40.160
It needs to go in tonight.

39:42.423 --> 39:44.773
Do it yourself, bitch.

39:44.817 --> 39:46.253
What the fuck?

39:46.296 --> 39:47.472
I'm fucking filing?

39:47.515 --> 39:50.039
Now I'm fucking filing shit
for you now?

39:51.911 --> 39:55.393
So, life good? Grades good?

39:55.436 --> 39:59.788
Everything's rock-solid
on all counts, yeah.

39:59.832 --> 40:02.617
Now, that's an answer that
wouldn't pass a polygraph.

40:05.664 --> 40:07.709
Well, Dad lost a big contract
today...

40:07.753 --> 40:09.494
Can barely pay himself, so...

40:09.537 --> 40:10.799
Shit.

40:10.843 --> 40:13.933
Yeah, I don't have a summer job,

40:13.976 --> 40:16.065
but other than that,
everything is good.

40:16.109 --> 40:17.197
Can't complain.

40:17.240 --> 40:18.633
How 'bout you?

40:18.677 --> 40:21.070
I spend me whole day
complaining.

40:21.114 --> 40:23.638
That I know.

40:23.682 --> 40:25.988
Tell you what...

40:26.032 --> 40:29.992
Pete was helping me rebuild
Ida's gazebo.

40:30.036 --> 40:32.865
I could throw you
a couple of bucks.

40:32.908 --> 40:34.519
Yeah. Definitely.

40:34.562 --> 40:36.912
Great.

40:38.348 --> 40:40.263
I-I'm sorry about that,
by the way.

40:40.307 --> 40:44.050
Yeah. Yeah.

40:44.093 --> 40:46.444
Good man.

40:46.487 --> 40:48.663
Lived good, died shitty.

40:51.361 --> 40:52.624
Are you doing okay?

40:56.758 --> 40:58.499
Asked and answered.

41:00.066 --> 41:02.285
Well, I'll tell you,

41:02.329 --> 41:05.506
I'll give you your space
for now, man, you know?

41:05.550 --> 41:06.681
"Now, man"?

41:06.725 --> 41:08.683
And I-I'll be here
for you when you...

41:08.727 --> 41:10.487
When you're ready to drop
the act, you know...

41:10.511 --> 41:13.166
No, don't... because it's... Sorry.

41:13.209 --> 41:15.298
No!
I-I didn't want to interrupt.

41:15.342 --> 41:17.039
He's... He's got
all college-y on us.

41:18.519 --> 41:19.670
I didn't want to interrupt.
I just came to see...

41:19.694 --> 41:20.932
No, no! Can I get you something else?

41:20.956 --> 41:22.543
Thanks, no, no.
It was great, really. I'm...

41:22.567 --> 41:23.785
Burger?

41:23.829 --> 41:25.352
No, I'm trying to be good,
really.

41:25.395 --> 41:26.851
Yeah, I understand.
Beer? No, no, honestly, thank you.

41:26.875 --> 41:27.963
I'll take a beer.

41:30.183 --> 41:32.315
Come on.

41:32.359 --> 41:34.883
Okay, okay, okay.

41:34.927 --> 41:37.103
Think about it. Why not? Why not?

41:39.322 --> 41:41.324
Holly seems pretty excited
about the new business.

41:41.368 --> 41:42.804
Yeah.

41:42.848 --> 41:45.154
On a scale of 1-10...
Your dad being a 10...

41:45.198 --> 41:46.155
I'd say she's about a 9.

41:46.199 --> 41:47.548
Or a 20.

41:50.246 --> 41:51.596
Aww, thank you.

41:51.639 --> 41:53.598
Thanks, Pop. You're a gentlemen.

41:53.641 --> 41:55.469
I'm growing up.

41:55.513 --> 41:57.384
Apparently so.

41:59.821 --> 42:02.084
Yep. 10.

42:07.960 --> 42:09.265
So, here's to you.

42:15.358 --> 42:18.013
What number would you be?

42:18.057 --> 42:20.015
You know me.
I'm not the excitable type.

42:20.059 --> 42:21.669
Yeah, right.

42:21.713 --> 42:23.279
I'd like to call bullshit
on that one.

42:25.281 --> 42:27.501
Asked and answered.

42:27.545 --> 42:30.199
Do you want some cake?

42:30.243 --> 42:32.201
Here you go. I hope you like it.

42:32.245 --> 42:36.597
It was supposed to be red,
not blue, but sorry about that.

42:36.641 --> 42:39.469
Do you want some cake?

42:40.253 --> 42:42.777
I hope you like it.

42:42.821 --> 42:46.346
Yeah, they got the...
color wrong.

42:46.389 --> 42:50.045
I've been wanting
to talk to you all day.

42:50.089 --> 42:51.264
He's awake.

42:53.092 --> 42:54.702
Fucking hell, he's awake?

42:57.096 --> 42:58.314
Did he talk?

42:58.358 --> 43:00.142
No, God, no.

43:00.186 --> 43:03.929
But he looked right at another
nurse, right in her eyes.

43:03.972 --> 43:05.234
I'll be over shortly.

43:06.801 --> 43:08.977
Bill, you all right?
What's wrong?

43:09.021 --> 43:11.023
- Brady.
- Brady?

43:11.066 --> 43:12.851
He's awake.

43:12.894 --> 43:14.524
Yeah, just tell your dad
thanks a lot, will ya,

43:14.548 --> 43:16.115
and m-make sure Holly gets back.

43:16.158 --> 43:17.725
Bill.

43:37.440 --> 43:40.095
Son, I want to show Rich
your report card.

43:40.139 --> 43:41.880
Run up and get it for me.

43:41.923 --> 43:44.752
Yeah, c-colleges
don't make report cards, Dad.

43:44.796 --> 43:46.754
Okay, well, whatever,
your grades.

43:46.798 --> 43:49.017
Go. I'm gonna be over here.

43:49.061 --> 43:50.671
Okay.

43:53.195 --> 43:55.415
Hey. Where'd Bill go?

43:55.458 --> 43:57.504
He left.

43:57.547 --> 43:59.854
But he didn't say goodbye.

43:59.898 --> 44:01.334
Yeah.

44:01.377 --> 44:03.181
He said something about Brady
waking up, and then...

44:03.205 --> 44:04.554
Wait. Brady woke up?

44:04.598 --> 44:05.991
Yeah, I don't know, Holly.

44:06.034 --> 44:07.754
Just stick around, okay?
I want to catch up.

44:22.442 --> 44:24.618
You've been window shopping
for months,

44:24.662 --> 44:26.272
and now you're finally
getting it.

44:26.315 --> 44:29.449
What changed, darling?

44:29.492 --> 44:32.713
It was time.

45:34.601 --> 45:37.430
Ida How was the party?

45:37.473 --> 45:41.390
It was slightly more
enjoyable than Pete's funeral

45:41.434 --> 45:45.090
because no one was crying, but
the food wasn't nearly as good.

45:49.398 --> 45:51.313
Have you seen Bill?

45:51.357 --> 45:55.274
He left the party earlier,
and he's not answering my calls.

45:55.317 --> 45:56.797
He'll turn up.

45:56.841 --> 45:58.668
He always does.

46:04.065 --> 46:08.026
He never leaves the lights on
for when he comes home.

46:08.069 --> 46:09.699
He says he doesn't want to pay
the electric company

46:09.723 --> 46:14.336
more than he has to, but I think
that he just prefers the dark.

46:14.380 --> 46:16.948
There's nothing wrong
with a little darkness.

46:21.691 --> 46:22.736
Night.

46:22.780 --> 46:24.520
Night.

46:35.357 --> 46:36.663
Take me out of this room.

46:39.666 --> 46:41.886
Go outside.

46:41.929 --> 46:44.540
Um...

46:44.584 --> 46:47.587
get me out
of this fucking hospital.

46:47.630 --> 46:49.154
Let's go for a walk, okay?

46:49.197 --> 46:50.982
Let's go for a walk.

47:19.706 --> 47:22.361
Come on!

47:22.404 --> 47:25.364
Dare I say it...
We take the stairs?

47:38.290 --> 47:39.508
Holy fuck.

47:39.552 --> 47:40.596
Going down?

47:41.946 --> 47:43.556
No, thank you.

47:52.521 --> 47:56.308
There is a fucking God.

47:56.351 --> 47:57.720
There's a God.
There's a fucking God.

47:57.744 --> 47:59.441
There's a fucking God.

48:10.148 --> 48:11.497
Fuck.

48:11.540 --> 48:14.108
Fuck. Um, get a knife.

48:14.152 --> 48:15.196
Get a fucking knife.

48:15.240 --> 48:18.373
Get a fucking...
Get a... scalpel.

48:18.417 --> 48:20.593
Get a scalpel, Sadie.

48:44.573 --> 48:46.140
You look the same to me.

49:04.028 --> 49:05.638
Don't mean to interrupt.

49:06.421 --> 49:08.467
Are you family?

49:10.034 --> 49:12.732
You could say as much.

49:12.775 --> 49:14.255
I should get going.

49:14.299 --> 49:15.387
I didn't mean to scare you.

49:15.430 --> 49:16.692
I'm, um...

49:16.736 --> 49:18.433
Just following protocol.

49:18.477 --> 49:21.045
Yep.

49:21.088 --> 49:22.046
You didn't scare me.

49:22.089 --> 49:24.048
Time's up, you fat fuck.

49:52.076 --> 49:54.426

49:59.909 --> 50:01.346
Fuck!

50:01.389 --> 50:04.479
Go back to the desk.

50:04.523 --> 50:06.829
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

What's going on with him?

50:13.271 --> 50:15.099
Fuck if I know.

50:15.142 --> 50:17.231
Get out of here, Bill. Go.

50:32.072 --> 50:33.204
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

50:38.078 --> 50:39.514
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
