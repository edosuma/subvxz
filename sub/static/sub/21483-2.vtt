00:01.913 --> 00:03.405
- What do you think, guys?
- There it is!

00:03.525 --> 00:04.292
Yeah, it's great.

00:04.412 --> 00:06.169
And the airbrushing
job's awesome.

00:06.449 --> 00:07.239
It's not airbrushed.

00:07.241 --> 00:09.604
Well, now, your breasts are way
fuller in the ad than in real life.

00:09.606 --> 00:12.957
Those aren't airbrushed,
Taco, those are the girls.

00:13.077 --> 00:17.074
It could be a push-up bra, but based on
lift not only up but out, I doubt it.

00:17.194 --> 00:18.608
And the mole on your
left breast is gone.

00:18.610 --> 00:21.080
Unless it's closer to the
areola than I... Okay.

00:21.082 --> 00:22.851
That's... that's enough.

00:22.853 --> 00:23.619
Inappropriate.

00:23.621 --> 00:25.624
What if she's in a terrible
accident one day, and someone

00:25.626 --> 00:27.192
has to tell them how to put
her titties back together?

00:27.194 --> 00:27.960
What?

00:27.962 --> 00:28.894
I'd do the same for you.

00:28.896 --> 00:29.894
I have a picture of your penis.

00:29.896 --> 00:30.864
Um, excuse me?

00:30.866 --> 00:32.634
I don't want you taking
any more dick pics of me.

00:32.636 --> 00:33.635
You understand me?

00:33.637 --> 00:34.371
Kevin!

00:34.373 --> 00:36.108
Does everyone have
a dick pic of me?

00:36.110 --> 00:37.043
Look at this!

00:37.045 --> 00:37.910
What is he doing?

00:37.912 --> 00:38.912
There's so many benches.

00:38.914 --> 00:40.382
Why is he picking my bench?

00:40.384 --> 00:43.253
Well, he could have chosen any
bench, and he chose yours.

00:43.255 --> 00:45.255
He's right up in those titties.

00:45.257 --> 00:46.256
Yeah.

00:46.258 --> 00:49.259
Mmm... Whoa, he is
motorboating those fakies.

00:49.261 --> 00:50.427
Oh, God.

00:50.547 --> 00:55.613

00:55.733 --> 00:57.667
This season already sucks.

00:57.669 --> 01:00.002
This is not good on my stomach
and my bowels, all right?

01:00.004 --> 01:01.137
Oh, come on.

01:01.139 --> 01:03.475
I can't talk to Ruxin about the
draft order, I can't talk to

01:03.477 --> 01:05.578
Andre about the porno... Guys.

01:05.580 --> 01:07.013
Oh, hello, gentlemen.

01:07.015 --> 01:08.015
Hey, there.

01:08.017 --> 01:09.017
Hey.

01:09.019 --> 01:12.623
I bring wonderful news to fill
your pathetic social calendars.

01:12.625 --> 01:16.329
You're going to be receiving an Evite
shortly to a Sukkot party at my house.

01:16.331 --> 01:17.163
A what kind of party?

01:17.165 --> 01:17.997
Coat party?

01:17.999 --> 01:18.831
Sukkot.

01:18.833 --> 01:20.635
It's the Jewish
harvest festival.

01:20.637 --> 01:23.439
We all hang out in this
tent thing in my yard.

01:23.441 --> 01:24.640
It's like a Jewish Bonnaroo?

01:24.642 --> 01:27.378
Yeah, minus the patcholi
and underlying sadness.

01:27.380 --> 01:31.250
All right, so... since when does Sophia
allow you to celebrate Judaism in your

01:31.252 --> 01:32.017
house?

01:32.019 --> 01:32.852
No, no, no.

01:32.854 --> 01:33.520
Forget Sophia.

01:33.522 --> 01:35.355
Since when do <i>you</i> allow
Judaism in your own house?

01:35.357 --> 01:38.260
Uh, trying to get Baby Geoffrey in to a
Jewish preschool, and I have to invite

01:38.262 --> 01:41.997
Mrs. Klein over, who runs the
school, to make a good impression.

01:41.999 --> 01:44.968
But just be aware...
don't park in the driveway, because there's

01:44.970 --> 01:48.640
a pothole right in front of it that will
scrape the tits right off of your car.

01:48.642 --> 01:50.642
Why don't you just call the
city and have them fix it?

01:50.644 --> 01:53.045
I've called the city 100
times, but they do not care

01:53.047 --> 01:57.150
about the plight of the upper-
middle-class white suburban male at all.

01:57.152 --> 01:59.753
Yeah, that's because they spend all their
time cleaning grfiti off walls in my

01:59.755 --> 02:00.653
neighborhood.

02:00.655 --> 02:01.554
That's a city ordinance.

02:01.556 --> 02:05.392
The city has to clean up any dangerous
or racially insensitive material ASAP.

02:05.394 --> 02:08.997
There's nothing racially insensitive
about a dragon with a chainsaw penis.

02:10.066 --> 02:11.332
Of course there isn't.

02:11.334 --> 02:12.400
Hello!

02:12.402 --> 02:13.401
Hey, babe.

02:13.403 --> 02:15.636
Oh... Oh, it's getting quiet.

02:15.638 --> 02:16.637
The walk-away.

02:16.639 --> 02:17.605
Here we go.

02:17.607 --> 02:18.606
You have to be very specific.

02:18.608 --> 02:21.041
That aisle is very
confusing to me.

02:21.043 --> 02:23.378
Well, is "pearl" a
style or a brand?

02:23.380 --> 02:24.379
What is it?

02:24.381 --> 02:25.380
Oh.

02:25.382 --> 02:26.381
We talking lady stuff?

02:26.383 --> 02:27.383
Okay, bye, all right, bye.

02:27.385 --> 02:28.217
Thank you.

02:28.219 --> 02:29.051
Very much.

02:29.053 --> 02:31.455
Jenny's got her period, so it's
probably a joy for me at home,

02:31.457 --> 02:33.056
and I have to stop
and get tampons.

02:33.058 --> 02:34.726
I thought at this point, after
all the time you spend

02:34.728 --> 02:36.527
together, you'd be
on the same cycle.

02:36.529 --> 02:38.964
We do not get our periods
at the same time.

02:38.966 --> 02:41.568
Oh, no wait, you and Pete...
No, I... Oh, God.

02:41.570 --> 02:42.402
Forget it.

02:42.404 --> 02:44.137
That never gets old
for you, does it?

02:44.139 --> 02:46.374
Does a man ever tired of
looking at the sunrise...

02:46.376 --> 02:48.309
when he's balls-deep in Kevin?

02:51.304 --> 02:52.237
That's impressive.

02:52.239 --> 02:53.231
How'd you get them
out here so fast?

02:53.351 --> 02:54.569
What do I owe the
pleasure, Pete?

02:54.689 --> 02:56.204
Well, I got a trade
proposition for you.

02:56.329 --> 02:57.737
Dwayne Bowe for Owen Daniels.

02:57.857 --> 02:59.047
More than fair trade.

02:59.167 --> 02:59.962
Helps everybody.

03:00.082 --> 03:01.222
Would you like to
hear my counteroffer?

03:01.342 --> 03:04.999
Owen Daniels for LeSean
McCoy and Tolbert.

03:05.001 --> 03:06.000
Really?

03:06.002 --> 03:07.836
Do, do you really think
that's going to work?

03:07.838 --> 03:10.505
It's like you trolling around the
bar looking for a hand jibber.

03:10.507 --> 03:12.507
Every once in a while,
someone says yes.

03:12.509 --> 03:13.408
Were you guys taking trades?

03:13.410 --> 03:14.242
Yeah.

03:14.244 --> 03:15.243
How's the sukkah coming along?

03:15.245 --> 03:17.077
Oh, it's coming
along great, man.

03:17.079 --> 03:18.011
Where did you get that wood?

03:18.013 --> 03:18.846
Don't ask.

03:18.848 --> 03:21.548
Look, I'm sensing that there could be
like a multi-team trade happening here.

03:21.550 --> 03:22.549
Mm-hmm.

03:22.551 --> 03:23.550
But we're one man short.

03:23.552 --> 03:24.551
That man is Andre.

03:24.553 --> 03:25.419
Yeah.

03:25.421 --> 03:27.621
Well, the problem with Andre is,
he won't trade with us unless we

03:27.623 --> 03:29.489
go to his apartment.

03:29.491 --> 03:30.490
Where we shot a porno film.

03:30.492 --> 03:31.491
Oh.

03:31.493 --> 03:32.391
Exactly.

03:32.393 --> 03:33.225
I was in the room.

03:33.227 --> 03:34.226
There was so much semen.

03:34.228 --> 03:35.260
Ugh.

03:35.262 --> 03:37.429
I don't want to go.

03:37.431 --> 03:39.030
Oh, but I need a running back!

03:39.032 --> 03:40.031
Okay.

03:40.033 --> 03:42.100
I will go, but I'm going to go
change my clothes and then throw

03:42.102 --> 03:43.401
them in the trash afterwards.

03:43.403 --> 03:47.339
What trash can?

03:47.341 --> 03:48.340
Gentlemen, welcome.

03:48.342 --> 03:49.208
Come on in.

03:49.210 --> 03:50.042
S'up?

03:50.044 --> 03:51.510
Come on, sit down,
take a load off.

03:51.512 --> 03:53.378
You know, I think better on
my feet, I'm good, thank you.

03:53.380 --> 03:54.780
My knees don't work.

03:54.782 --> 03:55.881
All right, all right.

03:55.883 --> 03:56.949
Your loss.

03:56.951 --> 04:02.055
And I am now open for any and all...
Oh, ooh, boy.

04:02.057 --> 04:04.023
Five-second rule, right?

04:05.026 --> 04:06.392
Gross.

04:06.394 --> 04:08.761
So what's the uh,
the trade proposal?

04:08.763 --> 04:10.529
It's a four-way
trade, basically.

04:10.531 --> 04:11.530
It would involve
the four of us.

04:11.532 --> 04:14.099
It could help
everybody's teams out.

04:14.101 --> 04:15.233
No.

04:15.235 --> 04:16.233
I don't trust it.

04:16.236 --> 04:17.134
Look, Taco's in.

04:17.136 --> 04:18.067
I'm in.

04:18.070 --> 04:18.902
Even Ruxin's in.

04:18.904 --> 04:22.472
I'm not... I mean, come on, you're not
going to make me beg on you, are you?

04:22.474 --> 04:25.241
Don't touch
me, don't touch me!

04:25.243 --> 04:26.209
Calm down, all right?

04:26.211 --> 04:28.311
I know that you live on a futon,
but just because it's a piece of

04:28.313 --> 04:30.146
art doesn't mean we
can't sit on it.

04:30.148 --> 04:33.382
I mean, hell, I sleep
on this thing.

04:33.384 --> 04:35.251
That's probably
drool over here.

04:35.253 --> 04:37.554
Ugh.

04:37.556 --> 04:38.888
Not drool.

04:39.758 --> 04:43.159
Yeah, gotta get that cleaned...
.h Look at this.

04:43.161 --> 04:44.126
You left your ring here, Ruxin.

04:44.128 --> 04:44.960
Uh-uh, not mine.

04:44.962 --> 04:46.762
What do you mean,
it's not your ring?

04:46.764 --> 04:47.763
It says "Ruxin" right on it.

04:47.765 --> 04:48.764
Yeah, it says Ruxin, right?

04:48.766 --> 04:49.765
That's definitely your ring.

04:49.767 --> 04:50.465
Yeah, take it back.

04:50.467 --> 04:51.299
No, gross.

04:51.301 --> 04:52.133
Take it.

04:52.135 --> 04:53.134
Kiss the ring.

04:53.136 --> 04:54.969
Yeah, I think you
should go ahead.

04:54.971 --> 04:55.837
Ah!

04:55.839 --> 04:57.271
There you go, take the ring.

05:01.144 --> 05:03.510
So what's up with
the Sacko porno?

05:03.512 --> 05:04.945
I got a fax from Dirty Randy.

05:04.947 --> 05:05.946
It's almost done.

05:05.948 --> 05:06.747
A fax?

05:06.749 --> 05:07.748
How lovely.

05:07.750 --> 05:08.349
Oh, God.

05:08.351 --> 05:08.983
What?

05:08.985 --> 05:10.118
Evite from Ruxin.

05:10.120 --> 05:10.919
Here we go.

05:10.921 --> 05:12.087
Oh, for that Sukkot thing?

05:12.089 --> 05:12.788
Sukkot?

05:12.790 --> 05:14.357
I don't know what
this thing is.

05:14.359 --> 05:16.526
Oh, I have an idea how
to roll out the porno.

05:16.528 --> 05:18.528
You know those video
billboards on Michigan Avenue?

05:18.530 --> 05:19.196
Mm-hmm.

05:19.198 --> 05:25.102
We can play a scene-by-scene ou're driv...
Oh, my God.

05:25.104 --> 05:26.537
What?

05:26.539 --> 05:27.538
Google Earth.

05:27.540 --> 05:30.941
Getting closer, getting closer.

05:30.943 --> 05:32.976
And there he is!

05:32.978 --> 05:34.445
Caught on Google Maps.

05:34.447 --> 05:35.045
Oh.

05:35.047 --> 05:35.546
Wow.

05:35.548 --> 05:36.313
Ruxin.

05:36.315 --> 05:37.380
You tag, Ruxin?

05:37.382 --> 05:39.549
Wow, we have more in
common than I thought.

05:39.551 --> 05:40.851
Probably not even me.

05:40.853 --> 05:42.786
I wish we could get
closer somehow.

05:42.788 --> 05:43.520
Uh-oh!

05:43.522 --> 05:46.556
Oh...
Smug face and all, there he is.

05:46.558 --> 05:49.360
I do appreciate you telling me, 'cause
I was able to un-send that Evite.

05:49.362 --> 05:52.030
Correct me if I'm wrong here,
but that's you, that's a

05:52.032 --> 05:55.000
swastika, so that would
make you anti-Semitic?

05:55.002 --> 05:56.334
You're a self-hating Jew.

05:56.336 --> 05:58.036
First of all, I
don't hate myself.

05:58.038 --> 06:00.939
And second, if I did look
inward, which I won't, I think

06:00.941 --> 06:04.510
we would find that my Judaism would be
the least objectionable thing about me.

06:04.512 --> 06:06.979
But that is an
egregious hate crime.

06:06.981 --> 06:07.846
It's a hideous act.

06:07.848 --> 06:09.380
You have to be
ashamed of yourself.

06:09.382 --> 06:12.050
Oh, ladies, I know we're on
that time of the month, but

06:12.052 --> 06:13.051
let's just relax a little.

06:13.053 --> 06:14.085
What?

06:14.087 --> 06:14.719
What?

06:14.721 --> 06:15.354
What?

06:15.356 --> 06:17.022
Yeah, she's on her period, right?
Yeah.

06:17.024 --> 06:17.823
Yeah.

06:17.825 --> 06:18.523
What? You told me.

06:18.525 --> 06:20.259
Anyway, the street has
never looked better.

06:20.261 --> 06:21.226
Can we all agree on that?

06:21.228 --> 06:22.895
Well, we have the answer
to the equation then.

06:22.897 --> 06:25.530
Problem plus swastika
equals problem solved.

06:25.532 --> 06:26.765
Tell that to the Jews.

06:26.767 --> 06:28.234
That's it.

06:28.236 --> 06:29.535
I'm offering a reward.

06:29.537 --> 06:33.138
Any player on my team-- the best
team-- for information about

06:33.140 --> 06:35.908
what happened in my loft.

06:35.910 --> 06:38.077
Nothing happened in your loft.

06:38.079 --> 06:38.544
Really?

06:38.546 --> 06:39.545
You're going crazy.

06:39.547 --> 06:40.446
Nothing happened in my loft.

06:40.448 --> 06:41.213
Oh, I'm going crazy.

06:41.215 --> 06:42.181
Guess what?

06:42.183 --> 06:43.549
I contracted thrush.

06:43.551 --> 06:44.517
Thrush?

06:44.519 --> 06:45.118
Yeah.

06:45.120 --> 06:46.753
That's a woman's
vaginal disease.

06:46.755 --> 06:47.353
I know.

06:47.355 --> 06:48.220
It's a yeast infection.

06:48.222 --> 06:49.922
Oh, my God, it's in your
vagina-- this is serious.

06:49.924 --> 06:50.790
I don't have a vagina!

06:50.792 --> 06:52.759
If you kept your vagina clean,
you wouldn't have thrust.

06:52.761 --> 06:53.559
It's thrush, Taco.

06:53.561 --> 06:56.129
Wait, aren't you supposed to get
thrush from sleeping with one?

06:56.131 --> 06:59.400
Yes, but that is not
possible at this time.

06:59.402 --> 07:00.201
No further comment.

07:00.203 --> 07:01.502
It's the Immaculate Infection.

07:01.504 --> 07:03.204
Yes, it is.

07:03.206 --> 07:06.774
Laugh all you want, but I know
none you can pass up a deal.

07:06.776 --> 07:10.044
Anyone on my roster
for information.

07:10.046 --> 07:10.511
Any player?

07:10.513 --> 07:11.512
Any player.

07:11.514 --> 07:12.280
Timmy Brigg?

07:12.282 --> 07:13.314
Yeah, even Timmy Brigg.

07:13.316 --> 07:14.382
You know, oh, no, no!

07:14.384 --> 07:15.116
(bleep) you!

07:15.118 --> 07:16.484
This is not about me.

07:16.486 --> 07:17.986
I am the accuser.

07:17.988 --> 07:20.989
'Cause I know there be a witch
in this town, and you're all

07:20.991 --> 07:22.158
suspects, you cowpokes.

07:22.160 --> 07:26.028
And this dark city of Gotham's
got a gloomy cloud, 'cause I'm

07:26.030 --> 07:28.298
gonna ride my horse
right down Main Street.

07:28.300 --> 07:29.833
You're really mixing genres.

07:29.835 --> 07:30.467
Am I?

07:30.469 --> 07:32.403
Is that a detective
hat or a cowboy hat?

07:32.405 --> 07:34.305
It's a modernist porkpie by
Juicy, if you must know.

07:34.307 --> 07:35.306
Adios.

07:35.308 --> 07:36.907
Andre, there's no
number on this thing.

07:36.909 --> 07:38.943
Should we just contact you
at the free health clinic?

07:38.945 --> 07:42.114
I will make a hotline
and you will call that.

07:42.116 --> 07:44.116
Arrivedei, amigas.

07:44.118 --> 07:45.550
You guys want a drink?

07:45.552 --> 07:46.418
Couple Bloody Marys?

07:46.420 --> 07:47.952
That's really funny, Ruxin.

07:47.954 --> 07:49.354
Not cool.

07:49.356 --> 07:51.189
Look, he's there.

07:51.191 --> 07:53.491
He's always there, Kevin.

07:53.493 --> 07:54.825
He's ruining my sign.

07:54.827 --> 07:57.361
The good news is he's not
motorboating your breasts anymore.

07:57.363 --> 07:58.362
He has done worse.

07:58.364 --> 07:59.096
Really?

07:59.098 --> 07:59.696
Yes.

07:59.698 --> 08:00.497
It's where he lives.

08:00.499 --> 08:02.866
You have got to get him
to pick another bench.

08:02.868 --> 08:05.469
You want me to kick the
homeless guy off the bench?

08:05.471 --> 08:07.872
Yes, evict him from my bench.

08:07.874 --> 08:10.108
So not only now will he be
homeless, he'll be benchless.

08:10.110 --> 08:10.709
Yes.

08:10.711 --> 08:11.509
I can't do that.

08:11.511 --> 08:12.210
That's not me.

08:12.212 --> 08:13.011
You can do this.

08:13.013 --> 08:13.512
Do it!

08:13.514 --> 08:14.313
Fine.

08:14.315 --> 08:15.447
Go.

08:15.449 --> 08:16.115
Please.

08:16.117 --> 08:16.716
Fine.

08:16.718 --> 08:20.119
Go.

08:20.121 --> 08:22.321
Hello.

08:22.323 --> 08:23.823
Hi.

08:23.825 --> 08:25.524
Hi, how-how are you doing?

08:25.526 --> 08:27.126
Uh, I'm doing great.

08:27.128 --> 08:28.861
I'm-I'm living on a bench.

08:28.863 --> 08:31.229
I'm sorry, I sh--
that's-- stupid question.

08:31.231 --> 08:32.130
Apologize.

08:32.131 --> 08:36.567
Um, speaking of the bench, would
it be possible for me to get you

08:36.568 --> 08:40.738
to move off this bench, so that my
wife's ad can be seen by everyone?

08:40.740 --> 08:42.405
I like this bench.

08:42.408 --> 08:47.311
It's shady and it's upwind
from the bush I shit in.

08:47.313 --> 08:48.413
That's important.

08:48.415 --> 08:49.247
That's your wife?

08:49.249 --> 08:50.148
Yeah, that's my wife.

08:50.150 --> 08:51.149
She's a beauty, right?

08:51.151 --> 08:52.084
Yeah.

08:52.086 --> 08:53.552
She's the floating muse;

08:53.554 --> 08:55.554
a dreamscape of femininity.

08:55.556 --> 09:00.026
Look, buddy, I'm sorry that you're, uh,
you're down on your luck, all right?

09:00.028 --> 09:02.896
My wife's on her period, and she's
very, very mean right now,

09:02.898 --> 09:04.497
and this bench is all she has.

09:04.499 --> 09:06.966
It would make my life so much
easier if you could just find

09:06.968 --> 09:07.900
another bench, that's all.

09:07.902 --> 09:08.501
Very mean?

09:08.503 --> 09:11.404
Like, you know, just
grinding me into the ground.

09:11.406 --> 09:13.072
I been there myself, man.

09:13.074 --> 09:14.173
It's a horrible thing.

09:14.175 --> 09:15.107
Irrational, man.

09:15.109 --> 09:18.377
My ex threw my stuff on the street,
'cause she was having her period.

09:18.379 --> 09:19.244
You got it, man.

09:19.246 --> 09:21.246
I wish you all the best.

09:21.248 --> 09:22.881
I'll get out of
here; it's fine.

09:22.883 --> 09:24.016
Don't worry about it.

09:24.018 --> 09:25.750
You rest easy.

09:28.354 --> 09:29.387
You did it.

09:29.389 --> 09:30.522
And that's how we do that.

09:30.524 --> 09:31.423
What did you say to him?

09:31.425 --> 09:33.124
I took care of it, man to man.

09:33.126 --> 09:35.860
I just told him, I said, "Hey, man,
you're disrespecting my wife.

09:35.862 --> 09:37.938
She's my dreamscape
of femininity."

09:38.058 --> 09:39.128
- What?
- Yeah.

09:39.130 --> 09:39.796
You said that?

09:39.798 --> 09:41.096
Just came up with
it, top of my head.

09:41.216 --> 09:42.131
It was crazy.

09:42.251 --> 09:43.500
Like a warrior poet.

09:43.502 --> 09:44.334
Oh.

09:45.886 --> 09:48.105
Is there, like, a trade embargo
that I don't know about?

09:48.225 --> 09:50.602
I've literally put out,
like, ten trade offers.

09:50.825 --> 09:51.958
No bites, nothing.

09:51.960 --> 09:54.861
I got a couple feelers out there, too,
and no one seems to be responding.

09:54.863 --> 09:56.596
It's like everyone's on
lockdown or something.

09:56.598 --> 09:57.646
I totally offered you a trade.

09:57.766 --> 09:59.833
You offered me Michael
Crabtree for Michael Vick.

09:59.835 --> 10:01.768
I'm not gonna be trade-raped
by my own wife.

10:01.770 --> 10:02.836
I'd be so gentle.

10:02.838 --> 10:06.906
Seriously, the real problem here is this
whole reward situation that Andre is

10:06.908 --> 10:07.707
offering.

10:07.709 --> 10:09.041
You know Ruxin's gonna sing.

10:09.043 --> 10:09.942
He can't help himself.

10:09.944 --> 10:12.244
Ruxin would rat out his own
family if he thought it could

10:12.246 --> 10:13.178
get him in the playoffs.

10:13.180 --> 10:16.581
Yeah, and then Ruxin is gonna
tell Andre about Sexfest 2011 in

10:16.583 --> 10:19.183
his condo, and then Andre's
gonna get pissed off, and he's

10:19.185 --> 10:22.854
gonna tell Ruxin about how we screwed
him out of the first pick in the draft.

10:22.856 --> 10:23.621
You are the commissioner;

10:23.623 --> 10:24.389
you have to fix this.

10:24.391 --> 10:28.793
I don't want to be the guy who takes
the fall for all this-- hold... What?

10:28.795 --> 10:30.628
Hold on, I got to call you back.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.597
I got a Taco thing
happening here.

10:32.599 --> 10:34.465
All right, pick up the
pace, little Ellie.

10:34.467 --> 10:35.633
Stop riding me.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.101
Guys, what are you doing?

10:37.103 --> 10:38.035
We're building a suck-it!

10:38.037 --> 10:38.636
What?

10:38.638 --> 10:39.203
Excuse me?

10:39.205 --> 10:41.972
The sukkah for the Jewish
harvest festival of Sukkot.

10:41.974 --> 10:42.907
Why is it on our front lawn?

10:42.909 --> 10:44.909
Taco said we could
build it here.

10:44.911 --> 10:47.111
Taco has no jurisdiction
at our house, okay?

10:47.113 --> 10:48.413
I thought you liked the Jews.

10:48.415 --> 10:50.081
If you don't, we can move it.

10:50.083 --> 10:51.416
Uh, please, we love Jews.

10:51.418 --> 10:52.150
Jews are great.

10:52.152 --> 10:52.884
Jews are great.

10:52.886 --> 10:55.687
Well, Ellie is having a great time with
all these hammers and nails, so...

10:55.689 --> 10:57.655
She's killing it on
the electric saw.

10:57.657 --> 10:58.623
Learned in five minutes.

10:58.625 --> 10:59.157
Ellie.

10:59.159 --> 11:00.158
Go in, just watch some TV.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.893
Just go inside, we're gonna
start dinner soon, okay?

11:01.895 --> 11:02.660
Wash your hands, please.

11:02.662 --> 11:03.494
No promises!

11:03.496 --> 11:04.496
You're killing me here.

11:04.498 --> 11:06.964
Nail gun's a two-man job,
and this guy's useless.

11:06.966 --> 11:09.166
I want all of this
out of my house.

11:09.168 --> 11:11.536
Look, I can't have the party at
my house, 'cause people will

11:11.538 --> 11:13.838
Google Map it, they'll see the
swastika, and they'll think I'm

11:13.840 --> 11:17.975
having some sort of
suburban Kristallnacht.

11:17.977 --> 11:19.176
And whose fault is that?

11:19.178 --> 11:21.746
I would say Hitler, and
really, the Poles.

11:21.748 --> 11:23.181
They were the
worst of them all.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.082
Okay, enough.

11:24.084 --> 11:27.519
You want to build this here?
Fine, but you have to swear that

11:27.521 --> 11:30.155
you will never tell Andre about the
porno we filmed in his apartment.

11:30.157 --> 11:30.720
Yeah.

11:30.840 --> 11:31.393
Understand me?

11:31.513 --> 11:32.991
How dare you.

11:32.993 --> 11:34.192
I'm not kidding, Ruxin.

11:34.194 --> 11:37.161
One word to Andre, and you can
pack up this whole Hebrew

11:37.163 --> 11:39.831
Habitat for Humanity and
send it on to Skid Row.

11:39.833 --> 11:42.200
And by the way, Baby Geoffrey,
he can go to public school, too.

11:42.320 --> 11:43.335
What's wrong with public school?

11:43.455 --> 11:44.863
Stole this hammer
from a public school.

11:44.983 --> 11:46.204
Exactly.

11:46.206 --> 11:47.747
Fine.

11:48.271 --> 11:51.643
"Jenny MacArthur
has her period?"

11:51.645 --> 11:53.644
Kevin, what did you say to him?

11:53.646 --> 11:54.946
But, look, the bum's gone.

11:54.948 --> 11:57.515
How would a bum know
that I had my period?

11:57.517 --> 11:58.683
I don't, I don't know.

11:58.685 --> 12:01.852
Maybe he's, like, a
menstrual medium.

12:01.854 --> 12:02.787
A menstrual medium?

12:02.789 --> 12:08.459
Like, he sees menstrually, with cycles and...
the-the tides

12:08.461 --> 12:12.630
in and out and the-the way the moon goes over...
Are your brain and mouth

12:12.632 --> 12:14.065
connected, Kevin?

12:14.067 --> 12:15.667
Sometimes.

12:15.669 --> 12:16.830
Sometimes they're not.

12:16.950 --> 12:18.301
You have to fix this, Kevin.

12:18.303 --> 12:19.068
What do you want me to do?

12:19.070 --> 12:20.051
I don't care. I don't know.

12:20.171 --> 12:22.343
- How do you want me to fix this?
- I don't know! Just fix it, Kevin!

12:22.384 --> 12:24.752
Can you explain to me what
happened to the beautiful buxom

12:24.754 --> 12:27.221
lass who just wanted
to sell houses, huh?

12:27.223 --> 12:28.356
Fix it, Kevin.

12:28.358 --> 12:30.592
Just fix it.

12:30.594 --> 12:31.693
All right, come on, guys;

12:31.695 --> 12:33.394
we need to talk.

12:33.396 --> 12:34.228
Whoa.

12:34.230 --> 12:35.429
What the hell?

12:35.431 --> 12:36.797
Look at this.

12:36.799 --> 12:39.867
Taco, this sukkah is
supposed to be for Sukkot.

12:39.869 --> 12:43.571
Yes, and after
Sukkot comes Taccot.

12:43.573 --> 12:44.606
What is Taccot?

12:44.608 --> 12:47.809
Taccot is an ideal plane of
existence where the 12 tribes of

12:47.811 --> 12:50.912
Israel come together with people
who are high on mushrooms and

12:50.914 --> 12:52.647
groove to Aphex Twin.

12:52.649 --> 12:53.782
This is my home.

12:53.784 --> 12:56.718
Yeah, I'll give you all-access
passes at a discount rate.

12:56.720 --> 12:58.720
Guys, can we take
a seat, please?

12:58.722 --> 12:59.855
Sit.

13:00.858 --> 13:03.926
All right, I been thinking about
this a lot, and I think our

13:03.928 --> 13:04.860
league is lacking something.

13:04.862 --> 13:06.062
A giant.

13:06.064 --> 13:07.397
No, guys, trust.

13:07.399 --> 13:10.200
Every league gets to this point
where we've cheated each other

13:10.202 --> 13:12.536
so many times over the years, we
don't trust each other enough to

13:12.538 --> 13:13.737
make a simple trade.

13:13.739 --> 13:17.475
We've crossed the distrust horizon
into the land of no trades.

13:17.477 --> 13:19.444
Gee, I wonder who's
responsible for that.

13:19.446 --> 13:21.879
You are the Patient
Zero of distrust, Pete.

13:21.881 --> 13:22.647
Okay.

13:22.649 --> 13:23.447
I admit it.

13:23.449 --> 13:27.451
But it's t'se for us to clear the air
and get a little honesty going, okay?

13:27.453 --> 13:29.453
Okay.

13:29.455 --> 13:31.188
What happened in my
apartment during the draft?

13:31.190 --> 13:31.855
Nothing!

13:31.857 --> 13:32.588
Nothing!

13:32.590 --> 13:33.322
Nothing.

13:33.324 --> 13:35.091
Did you guys cheat
picking the draft order?

13:35.093 --> 13:35.691
No!

13:35.693 --> 13:36.325
No!

13:36.327 --> 13:36.892
No, no.

13:36.894 --> 13:37.593
No.

13:37.595 --> 13:38.193
Nope.

13:38.195 --> 13:38.894
Okay, good.

13:38.896 --> 13:44.466
Now that we're all being honest, I
would ke to show you something.

13:44.468 --> 13:45.167
Ooh.

13:45.903 --> 13:46.601
Cute!

13:46.603 --> 13:47.536
Mm-hmm.

13:47.538 --> 13:49.904
As you can all see, all
of our teams suck.

13:49.906 --> 13:52.107
Some of the lineups
aren't even legal.

13:52.109 --> 13:55.343
So in honor of Sukkot, I would
like to propose to you what I

13:55.345 --> 13:56.778
call the eight-way trade.

13:56.780 --> 13:57.846
Wait-- an eight-way?

13:57.848 --> 14:00.449
But Andre's sister's
not even here.

14:00.451 --> 14:01.550
Andre's sister?

14:01.552 --> 14:02.785
She's not gonna last.

14:02.787 --> 14:04.920
I think I've come up with a plan
that everyone will be happy

14:04.922 --> 14:06.222
with if we just... do this.

14:06.224 --> 14:08.658
Okay, Andre, you're in
need of a good defense.

14:08.660 --> 14:09.826
You got, like, four tight ends.

14:09.828 --> 14:12.229
I have four defenses
and no tight ends.

14:12.231 --> 14:13.464
Huh.

14:13.466 --> 14:14.665
Kevin, three quarterbacks.

14:14.667 --> 14:15.834
Yeah.

14:15.836 --> 14:18.303
That could help out Taco, and
the thing is, you got to start

14:18.305 --> 14:20.672
getting rid of some
of these kickers.

14:20.674 --> 14:21.840
I like kickers.

14:21.842 --> 14:22.874
They're the toughest.

14:22.876 --> 14:26.178
Jenny, you might need more at wide
receiver than just Michael Crabtree.

14:26.180 --> 14:27.879
Ruxin, you could let go of one
or two of your wide receivers.

14:27.881 --> 14:30.316
I'm not letting go
of anyone good-- no!

14:30.318 --> 14:32.885
Package two wide receivers with the
Baltimore defense and trade it for.. MJD.

14:32.887 --> 14:33.886
I like Maurice Jones-Drew.

14:33.888 --> 14:34.887
I know you do.

14:34.889 --> 14:35.888
Hey, what about me?

14:35.890 --> 14:37.890
Haven't forgotten
about you, Kevin.

14:37.892 --> 14:39.158
It's good.

14:39.160 --> 14:41.427
It's like a useless <i>Good
Will</i> <i>Hunting.</i>

14:41.429 --> 14:42.327
<i>It's still not fair.</i>

14:42.329 --> 14:43.228
<i>Just wait. Hold on.</i>

14:43.230 --> 14:44.429
<i>You just got a great kicker.</i>

14:44.431 --> 14:46.898
<i>One more move, and it's done.</i>

14:46.900 --> 14:48.166
<i>Do we havee a deal?</i>

14:48.168 --> 14:49.368
<i>Yeah.</i>

14:49.370 --> 14:50.569
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

14:50.571 --> 14:52.159
<i>Looks pretty good to me.</i>

14:52.279 --> 14:54.348
<i>Sukkot pact, 2011. All in?</i>

14:54.497 --> 14:55.503
<i>All in.</i>

14:55.623 --> 14:56.240
<i>Yeah, I'm in.</i>

14:56.360 --> 14:57.776
<i>Thank you.</i>

15:00.610 --> 15:01.416
How's the big trade coming?

15:01.536 --> 15:02.019
What's up?

15:02.083 --> 15:04.316
The deadline's Sukkot, so
I'm just about to check.

15:04.318 --> 15:06.966
Um, have you seen Andre?
Is he here yet?

15:07.086 --> 15:08.201
No, I haven't seen him. Why?

15:08.971 --> 15:10.160
The Sacko porno?

15:10.280 --> 15:11.853
It's finished? Yes!

15:11.985 --> 15:12.850
This is gonna be so epic.

15:12.852 --> 15:13.851
What's gonna be epic?

15:13.853 --> 15:15.052
Sukkot!

15:15.054 --> 15:15.986
Oh, yeah.

15:15.988 --> 15:17.036
Yeah.
What's up? Shalom.

15:17.156 --> 15:18.458
Shalom!

15:18.578 --> 15:20.458
Hey, does this count
as a yarmulka?

15:20.460 --> 15:22.527
Saw a picture of Ashton Kutcher
going into a Kabbalah center

15:22.529 --> 15:25.663
rocking one of these, so I figure if
he can do it-- pretty kosher, right?

15:25.665 --> 15:26.464
Yeah, totally.

15:26.466 --> 15:27.465
Totally kosher.

15:27.467 --> 15:28.399
Yeah.

15:28.401 --> 15:30.468
Let's go check this thing out.

15:30.470 --> 15:31.469
All right, cool.

15:31.471 --> 15:32.470
Cool.

15:32.472 --> 15:34.472
Oh. Um, I'll meet you guys
out at the Sukkot hut.

15:34.474 --> 15:35.473
Hi, Mrs. Klein. How are you?

15:35.475 --> 15:36.473
Rodney.

15:36.475 --> 15:37.474
Good Yontiff. Shalom.

15:37.476 --> 15:38.475
Shalom.

15:38.477 --> 15:39.476
have to ask.

15:39.478 --> 15:41.177
How did Jeffrey's
evaluation go?

15:41.179 --> 15:42.345
Very well.

15:42.347 --> 15:43.479
Very well.

15:43.481 --> 15:44.713
Lovely boy.

15:44.715 --> 15:45.914
Takes after his father.

15:45.916 --> 15:47.149
Mm.

15:47.151 --> 15:48.149
Thank you so much for coming.

15:48.151 --> 15:50.151
I'm sorry about the
change of venue.

15:50.153 --> 15:52.220
You know, the city is doing some
work outside my house, but the

15:52.222 --> 15:55.323
benefit is that we are now able
to share a rich Jewish tradition

15:55.325 --> 15:58.860
with those less fortunate than us,
both financially and spiritually.

15:58.862 --> 16:00.061
Have you met Jenny?

16:00.063 --> 16:01.262
No.

16:01.264 --> 16:02.430
Jenny?

16:02.432 --> 16:03.698
This is Mrs. Klein.

16:03.700 --> 16:04.900
Shalom.

16:04.902 --> 16:05.901
Hi.

16:05.903 --> 16:06.902
Thank you for comg.

16:06.904 --> 16:07.903
Absolutely.

16:07.905 --> 16:08.904
So this is your wife?

16:08.906 --> 16:10.106
No.

16:10.108 --> 16:11.340
No.

16:11.342 --> 16:14.444
No. My wife-- she, uh, came down
with something, so... Catholicism?

16:14.446 --> 16:15.712
Oh, look who it is.

16:15.714 --> 16:16.914
Hey, baby.

16:16.916 --> 16:18.916
I want to show
everybody the suckit.

16:18.918 --> 16:20.117
Sukkah.

16:20.119 --> 16:21.352
Suckit, suckit.

16:21.354 --> 16:22.220
Sukkah.

16:22.222 --> 16:23.087
No, the-the sukkah.

16:23.089 --> 16:24.088
Sukkah! Let's go.

16:24.090 --> 16:25.090
Okay.

16:25.092 --> 16:26.091
Shalom.

16:26.093 --> 16:27.926
Everything go okay
with the trade?

16:27.928 --> 16:28.760
Kevin's on it.

16:28.762 --> 16:29.761
It should be done by now.

16:29.763 --> 16:30.762
Hey, where's Sofia?

16:30.764 --> 16:32.830
I'm keeping her and her
family of conquistadors away

16:32.832 --> 16:34.798
until Jeffrey's acceptance
into the school.

16:34.800 --> 16:35.799
What's up, my shalom boys?

16:35.801 --> 16:36.800
Shabbat shalom.

16:36.802 --> 16:38.868
By the way, hooked up this giant
screen to the TV inside,

16:38.870 --> 16:42.138
and I got ten hours of Judaica-themed
trance music in case this party gets off

16:42.140 --> 16:43.272
the hook.

16:43.274 --> 16:45.274
I think this party is <i>not</i>
<i>going off the hook.</i>

16:45.276 --> 16:47.042
<i>Oh, are we gonna put people
on chairs and do that</i>

16:47.044 --> 16:47.910
<i>up-and-down thing?</i>

16:47.912 --> 16:49.846
<i>Oh, you very comfortable
with that motion, but...</i>

16:49.848 --> 16:50.780
<i>Yeah, I would be great at it.</i>

16:50.782 --> 16:51.781
<i>Yup.</i>

16:51.783 --> 16:54.418
<i>Everyone, you're invited
into the Jew fort.</i>

16:54.420 --> 16:56.987
<i>Ooh, I got wristbands
for everybody.</i>

16:56.989 --> 16:58.088
<i>Ooh.</i>

16:58.090 --> 16:59.290
<i>No. No, no wristbands, okay?</i>

16:59.292 --> 17:02.060
<i>Rodney has invited me here today
to lead you in the rite of</i>

17:02.062 --> 17:04.996
<i>the lulav, which is the
celebration of the harvest, and</i>

17:04.998 --> 17:08.166
<i>in order to do that, I need
four species of plants.</i>

17:08.169 --> 17:12.304
<i>Here you go.</i>

17:12.306 --> 17:16.508
<i>Ordinarily, we use the
date palm, the willow...</i>

17:16.510 --> 17:17.643
<i>Is that what I think it is?</i>

17:17.645 --> 17:18.844
<i>...and the lemon.</i>

17:18.846 --> 17:20.078
<i>Yeah.</i>

17:20.079 --> 17:24.047
<i>Well, this is my very own harvest,
grown in this sukkah hydroponically.</i>

17:24.166 --> 17:26.083
<i>I bet she's never
used weed before.</i>

17:26.085 --> 17:27.084
<i>Uh, (bleep) you.</i>

17:27.086 --> 17:28.285
<i>And what are these plants?</i>

17:28.893 --> 17:30.059
<i>The bitter herb.</i>

17:30.061 --> 17:31.860
<i>It's an unusual smell.</i>

17:31.862 --> 17:34.397
<i>Okay, let's just go
straight to the wine.</i>

17:34.399 --> 17:35.598
<i>Well, no, no, no, no.</i>

17:35.600 --> 17:36.746
- <i>Let-Let him do it.</i> 
<i>- This is beautiful.</i>

17:36.803 --> 17:39.582
<i>Blessed art thou, O Lord, our
God, king of the universe...</i>

17:39.702 --> 17:41.489
<i>I didn't realize that sukkah</i>
<i>was a</i> <i>high</i> holy day.

17:41.491 --> 17:43.891
...who has commanded
us to take the lulav.

17:43.893 --> 17:45.093
Amen.

17:45.981 --> 17:47.180
What's that smell?

17:47.182 --> 17:47.963
You promise me.

17:48.083 --> 17:49.850
Never smoke the lulav, okay?

17:49.852 --> 17:50.984
Okay.

17:50.986 --> 17:53.239
That's how your daddy got
your mommy to make you.

17:53.359 --> 17:55.560
I do have a Sukkot
presentation for everyone.

17:55.628 --> 17:57.089
No, I don't think
that's necessary, Taco.

17:57.209 --> 17:58.722
Oh, don't worry.
It's not a bother.

18:00.538 --> 18:01.537
We should share.

18:01.539 --> 18:02.772
Yes, of course.

18:02.774 --> 18:04.539
Absolutely. Ellie, you want to
do Uncle Taco a littlitfavor?

18:04.541 --> 18:05.774
Mm-hmm.

18:05.776 --> 18:08.677
Can you go inside and put the Sukkot
DVD in the DVD player, please?

18:08.679 --> 18:09.677
Okay.

18:09.679 --> 18:10.678
Thank you.

18:10.680 --> 18:11.679
You're welcome.

18:11.681 --> 18:12.680
Huh?

18:12.682 --> 18:13.682
Just got an e-mail.

18:13.684 --> 18:15.784
Looks like the trade
has gone through.

18:15.786 --> 18:16.785
Yes.

18:16.787 --> 18:18.620
Looks like it is a
seven-way trade.

18:18.622 --> 18:19.821
What?

18:19.823 --> 18:20.723
Looks like Andre screwed you.

18:20.725 --> 18:21.723
What?

18:21.725 --> 18:23.692
Everybody else got their
plays except for you.

18:23.694 --> 18:25.761
I think we're just gonna have
a quick little chat, if you

18:25.763 --> 18:26.695
don't mind. Excuse us.

18:26.697 --> 18:27.896
But... I'm sorry. Shalom.

18:27.898 --> 18:29.064
Hmm.

18:29.066 --> 18:30.299
No and no.

18:30.301 --> 18:31.500
Why'd you screw me?

18:31.502 --> 18:33.702
Okay, what happened to
the new honest league?

18:33.704 --> 18:34.702
You know what?

18:34.704 --> 18:36.704
If we're gonna start over,
I wanted to be you.

18:36.706 --> 18:39.107
I wanted to be the
patient zero, for once!

18:39.109 --> 18:40.508
Let me be patient zero.

18:40.510 --> 18:44.345
That is so wrong on so many levels,
I just can't even respond.

18:44.347 --> 18:46.981
"Sacka."

18:46.983 --> 18:50.018
Open.

18:50.020 --> 18:51.052
Close.

18:51.054 --> 18:54.890
I gave you my trust, and you turn
around, and you stab me in the back.

18:54.892 --> 18:57.326
Okay, I would never
do that to you!

18:57.328 --> 19:00.931
I'm back... I'm so tired from such
a long day of terrible doctoring.

19:00.933 --> 19:02.065
I've been waiting for you.

19:02.067 --> 19:03.333
Oh, shit.

19:03.335 --> 19:04.535
Well, hello.

19:04.537 --> 19:05.736
Hello.

19:05.738 --> 19:06.937
What is that?

19:06.939 --> 19:08.939
That is too early,
is what that is.

19:08.941 --> 19:10.941
What are you doing here
in my metrosexual loft?

19:10.943 --> 19:11.942
Oh, my God!

19:11.944 --> 19:14.344
I need a full-body
inspection right away.

19:14.346 --> 19:15.345
In my apartment!

19:15.347 --> 19:16.547
You know, I have to tell you.

19:16.549 --> 19:19.950
There's been a rash of anti-Semitic
graffiti in this neighborhood.

19:19.952 --> 19:20.951
What?

19:20.953 --> 19:26.517
And last night, I saw a man
paint a swastika on a bench.

19:26.637 --> 19:27.945
- No.
- Oh, yes.

19:28.065 --> 19:29.472
Oh, yeah, this is so right.

19:29.589 --> 19:30.922
Doctor. Yeah, Dr. Naughty.

19:30.924 --> 19:34.692
I love your teeth, I love your tummy...
Is that supposed to be me?

19:34.694 --> 19:36.138
Uh, an improved
version of you, yeah.

19:36.220 --> 19:38.220
I would never treat my
apartment like that.

19:39.221 --> 19:40.302
What about coming clean?

19:40.422 --> 19:42.104
Oh, he came clean
quite a few times.

19:42.106 --> 19:43.766
On my fainting coach?

19:43.886 --> 19:46.020
Oh... Oh, God.

19:46.276 --> 19:47.699
It's an antique.

19:48.072 --> 19:50.954
A man just came on my couch.

19:51.074 --> 19:53.700
You are paying for the steam
cleaning, and guess what?

19:53.820 --> 19:55.153
You're all pornographers.

19:55.155 --> 19:55.942
Every one of you!

19:56.062 --> 19:56.875
What is this?
