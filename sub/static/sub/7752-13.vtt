WEBVTT

00:01.802 --> 00:03.188
What the hell happened in here?

00:03.190 --> 00:04.829
<i>We've been able to
identify the victim.</i>

00:04.864 --> 00:07.229
Oh, my God.
That's Louie Becker.

00:07.340 --> 00:09.741
Blanca, you look beautiful
in Carmen's dress.

00:09.743 --> 00:11.075
Something bad happened.

00:11.077 --> 00:13.177
- With my dress?
- At the Stappords'.

00:13.179 --> 00:14.579
It's me.
I've got a problem.

00:14.581 --> 00:16.213
Aah!

00:16.216 --> 00:17.370
Oh, my God.

00:17.432 --> 00:20.718
Whoever killed Louie Becker
killed Blanca, too, right?

00:20.720 --> 00:22.554
I am not having an affair.

00:22.556 --> 00:24.923
Sooner or later,
I'm going to find out the truth.

00:24.925 --> 00:27.592
- It looks like blood.
- No, it's red wine.

00:27.594 --> 00:30.194
There's no way Taylor's
the one who killed them.

00:30.196 --> 00:33.331
- But she knows who did.
- And now she has to tell me.

00:33.333 --> 00:35.833
<i>That clown was taking
pictures in Katy's room.</i>

00:35.835 --> 00:37.435
I kept seeing Ernesto
whisper in his ear.

00:37.436 --> 00:38.236
Enough!

00:38.238 --> 00:39.938
Do I know you?

00:41.374 --> 00:44.042
You were never a prisoner
of the cartel.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.510
The cartel tracked me down.

00:45.512 --> 00:47.412
They wanted
to pull me back in, so...

00:47.414 --> 00:48.746
I proposed a trade.

00:48.748 --> 00:50.048
Katy's life?

00:50.050 --> 00:51.416
I can't believe Javi left you

00:51.418 --> 00:53.184
<i>just because you're carrying
another man's baby</i>

00:53.186 --> 00:55.286
<i>and tried to
pass it off as his.</i>

00:55.288 --> 00:58.289
The truth is,
I can't live without you.

00:58.291 --> 01:00.191
Well, it seems you can't
live with me, either.

01:00.193 --> 01:02.193
Let's go to couples' therapy.

01:02.195 --> 01:03.861
Seriously?

01:03.863 --> 01:06.764
This is Deion, our new son.

01:06.766 --> 01:09.701
How did Deion's father
even find us?

01:09.703 --> 01:12.704
I placed a call
to a private investigator.

01:12.706 --> 01:14.272
If you lose Deion, you lose me.

01:14.274 --> 01:15.907
I'll never forget you.

01:22.315 --> 01:23.481
I needed to see you.

01:23.483 --> 01:26.999
- Are you all right?
- I don't want to be alone.

01:31.257 --> 01:33.424
So, what's going on?

01:33.426 --> 01:35.517
Nancy Drew here thinks
she may have cracked

01:35.518 --> 01:37.228
the case in that
Louie Becker murder.

01:37.230 --> 01:38.358
Well, I haven't cracked it yet,

01:38.404 --> 01:40.565
but I'm pretty sure it was
his blood on Taylor's sofa.

01:40.567 --> 01:43.735
We think Louie got killed
at the Stappords' house

01:43.737 --> 01:45.269
and that Blanca
found out about it.

01:45.271 --> 01:47.138
- Oh, my God.
- I know.

01:47.140 --> 01:49.507
- We are so close.
- No.

01:49.509 --> 01:51.142
I mean, you're obsessed
with Blanca.

01:51.144 --> 01:53.411
When did we become
maids who solve murders?

01:53.413 --> 01:56.171
- Blanca was one of us.
- I know! But can't we talk about

01:56.172 --> 01:57.625
something fun for once?

01:57.660 --> 01:59.808
- She wants to talk about herself.
- No, I don't.

02:00.587 --> 02:01.919
But since
you brought it up...

02:01.921 --> 02:03.755
I have some good news.

02:03.757 --> 02:05.323
You know how I broke up
with Sebastien, right?

02:05.325 --> 02:08.660
- Yeah, thank God.
- We never liked him.

02:08.662 --> 02:10.161
You are way too good for him,
honey.

02:10.163 --> 02:11.262
Well?

02:11.264 --> 02:12.530
Have you told them the news?

02:12.532 --> 02:13.998
What news?

02:14.000 --> 02:16.934
Sebastien and I
are back together.

02:16.936 --> 02:21.372
And we're getting married!

02:24.043 --> 02:27.178
Oh, my God!

02:27.180 --> 02:28.880
Yay!

02:34.424 --> 02:39.229
<b>- sync and corrections by Zac -
- www.addic7ed.com -</b>

02:41.493 --> 02:44.395
Thank you so much
for meeting me.

02:44.397 --> 02:46.864
I know how upset you've been
since Deion left.

02:46.866 --> 02:50.802
I have been,
but I've made a decision.

02:50.804 --> 02:52.403
The past is the past.

02:52.405 --> 02:54.138
It's time to
start a new chapter.

02:54.140 --> 02:56.708
I'm so glad
to hear you say that...

02:56.710 --> 02:59.143
because I have
a little surprise.

03:01.547 --> 03:04.048
After Deion's departure,
I went to Social Services

03:04.050 --> 03:07.218
to see if they had
any more boys like him.

03:07.220 --> 03:09.020
It turns out...

03:09.022 --> 03:11.155
they do.

03:11.157 --> 03:14.892
- His name is Anfernee.
- I'm sorry.

03:14.894 --> 03:16.828
If the name Anfernee
is a deal-breaker,

03:16.830 --> 03:18.529
I'm sure we could
just call him Anthony.

03:18.531 --> 03:21.766
You can't just replace Deion.

03:21.768 --> 03:23.968
He's not a goldfish.

03:26.205 --> 03:28.565
I'm so sorry.

03:29.875 --> 03:32.610
But in other news,
I spoke to Sebastien,

03:32.612 --> 03:34.912
and he finally found a buyer
for the house.

03:34.914 --> 03:36.748
Really?
Oh, that's wonderful.

03:36.750 --> 03:39.383
Perhaps we should
order some bubbly to celebrate.

03:39.385 --> 03:41.285
Excuse me.
Is that the wine list?

03:41.287 --> 03:43.621
- Are you Adrian Powell?
- Yes?

03:43.623 --> 03:44.856
You've been served.

03:49.261 --> 03:50.428
What is this?

03:50.430 --> 03:52.631
That is
my petition for divorce.

03:53.398 --> 03:56.768
Like I said,
I'm starting a new chapter.

03:56.770 --> 03:59.103
And you're not in it.

04:01.000 --> 04:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:09.114 --> 04:10.414
Hi.

04:10.416 --> 04:12.049
Is Katy ready to go?

04:12.051 --> 04:14.552
Taylor...
we need to talk.

04:14.554 --> 04:16.286
Okay.

04:16.289 --> 04:19.322
- Should I come in or...?
- No. I'm keeping Katy.

04:19.325 --> 04:22.393
- She's not safe with you.
- What?

04:22.395 --> 04:24.562
I know you're freaked out
because the cartel found her...

04:24.564 --> 04:26.631
It's not about that.
It's about you.

04:26.633 --> 04:28.132
You're into
something dangerous.

04:28.134 --> 04:31.335
People around you keep dying...
Blanca, Louie...

04:31.337 --> 04:32.770
You're being ridiculous.
Let me see my daughter.

04:32.772 --> 04:34.138
No!
I'm doing this for her.

04:34.140 --> 04:36.440
- She's my daughter, too.
- Your daughter?

04:36.442 --> 04:38.442
You didn't even want to adopt her.
I had to talk you into it!

04:38.444 --> 04:40.111
That doesn't mean
I don't love her now.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.346
You're barely even around.
I'm the one who takes care of her!

04:42.348 --> 04:44.749
- Not anymore.
- Michael, you cannot keep her from me!

04:44.751 --> 04:46.784
- No, I think I can.
- Michael?!

04:46.786 --> 04:48.853
Michael!
You can't do this!

04:48.855 --> 04:49.887
Michael!

04:56.695 --> 04:58.095
Hi, Carmen!

04:58.097 --> 04:59.630
I was just on my way out
to talk to Taylor.

04:59.632 --> 05:00.932
Oh, good.
Then you're not busy.

05:00.934 --> 05:02.266
Actually, I...

05:02.268 --> 05:03.501
I'm quitting my job
at the Powells'.

05:03.503 --> 05:04.602
Can you tell them for me?

05:04.604 --> 05:06.037
Wait. What?

05:06.039 --> 05:07.805
Sebastien found a buyer
for their house,

05:07.807 --> 05:10.975
and it's a huge commission,
so I don't need that stupid job.

05:10.977 --> 05:12.009
Where are you gonna live?

05:12.011 --> 05:13.544
With Sebastien.

05:13.546 --> 05:15.346
He's got this great condo
from before he was married.

05:15.348 --> 05:19.116
Why would a married man want to
keep a condo on the side?

05:19.118 --> 05:20.718
I guess he liked it.

05:20.720 --> 05:21.853
Why are you acting like this?

05:21.855 --> 05:23.487
I just...

05:23.489 --> 05:25.489
think you two are moving
a little too fast.

05:25.491 --> 05:27.158
I've been dating him all year.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.626
You've been breaking up with him
all year.

05:28.628 --> 05:31.295
Only because he was married,
but he's not anymore.

05:31.297 --> 05:32.830
It finally feels right.

05:32.832 --> 05:34.532
Okay.

05:34.534 --> 05:36.334
But if Sebastien
cheated on his wife,

05:36.336 --> 05:37.635
what makes you think
he won't cheat on you?

05:37.637 --> 05:39.003
Have you seen me?

05:40.573 --> 05:43.040
I want you to go into this
with your eyes open.

05:43.042 --> 05:45.009
That's all.

05:45.011 --> 05:46.544
Look, my first husband
was a cheater,

05:46.546 --> 05:48.412
and I missed all the signs.

05:48.414 --> 05:49.981
It wasn't until
I starting snooping

05:49.983 --> 05:51.649
that I found out the truth.

05:51.651 --> 05:54.685
- You're just jealous.
- Excuse me?

05:54.687 --> 05:56.254
You can't keep a man
to save your life.

05:56.256 --> 05:58.189
Sorry.

05:58.191 --> 06:00.091
I'm not taking any advice
from you.

06:05.397 --> 06:08.332
Zoila and Genevieve.

06:08.334 --> 06:09.767
What can I do for you today?

06:09.769 --> 06:11.202
Before we start,

06:11.204 --> 06:13.204
I know that
this is couples' therapy,

06:13.206 --> 06:15.373
but we are not a couple.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.108
Oh, God, no.

06:17.110 --> 06:19.210
What a frightening thought.

06:19.212 --> 06:21.913
Just picturing it
sends a chill down my spine.

06:21.915 --> 06:25.151
- I think he gets it.
- So, how do you two know each other?

06:25.186 --> 06:30.021
Zoila has been my housekeeper
forever and a dear friend.

06:30.023 --> 06:32.056
But recently there's been

06:32.058 --> 06:34.125
a little hiccup
in our relationship.

06:34.127 --> 06:37.361
- She fired me.
- I briefly fired her.

06:37.363 --> 06:40.398
But I've apologized
several times,

06:40.400 --> 06:42.266
and she still won't
come back to work.

06:42.268 --> 06:46.103
After 20 years together,
you threw me aside for a man.

06:46.105 --> 06:48.706
I hardly "threw" you.

06:48.708 --> 06:51.709
Does it look like
I could throw her?

06:52.878 --> 06:56.314
Zoila, what do you see
as the main problem

06:56.316 --> 06:57.615
between you and Genevieve?

06:57.617 --> 07:00.117
She's selfish.
It's always about her.

07:00.119 --> 07:01.879
Can you tell her that?

07:04.222 --> 07:06.824
You're selfish.

07:06.826 --> 07:09.760
I like that. Good idea.

07:09.762 --> 07:11.228
Okay.

07:11.230 --> 07:13.564
Genevieve, what would you
like to say to that?

07:13.566 --> 07:18.502
Well, first I'd like to say
how grateful I am

07:18.504 --> 07:21.505
to be seen
by a doctor of your caliber.

07:21.507 --> 07:23.674
Oh, my God.

07:23.676 --> 07:26.010
She's trying to
win you over to her side.

07:26.012 --> 07:28.279
Selfish! Selfish.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.481
Now, Zoila, you had your turn.

07:30.483 --> 07:32.416
Let's give Genevieve hers.

07:32.418 --> 07:34.018
Thank you.

07:34.020 --> 07:37.188
You seem to be
such a good listener.

07:37.190 --> 07:40.491
I just know you'll be able to
get us through this little...

07:40.493 --> 07:42.827
- Snafu.
- Gesundheit.

07:50.502 --> 07:52.403
Spence?

07:55.507 --> 07:57.842
I know why
you won't return my calls,

07:57.844 --> 08:00.845
but I need to talk to you.

08:02.514 --> 08:04.415
I'm coming in!

08:07.786 --> 08:09.987
Oh, my God.

08:11.556 --> 08:12.790
Spence?

08:12.792 --> 08:14.158
Hi.

08:14.160 --> 08:16.060
I'm Megan, in 4B.

08:16.062 --> 08:18.462
- Are you looking for Spence?
- Uh-huh.

08:18.464 --> 08:20.364
Poor guy.
Why do you say that?

08:20.366 --> 08:21.799
Did something happen to him?

08:21.801 --> 08:23.734
What hasn't happened to him?

08:23.736 --> 08:26.137
First, his wife was in a coma.

08:26.139 --> 08:29.640
Then that horrible woman woke up
and left him for another man.

08:29.642 --> 08:30.975
How do you know Spence?

08:30.977 --> 08:33.309
I'm that horrible woman.

08:33.312 --> 08:34.678
Oh.

08:34.679 --> 08:36.047
Sorry.

08:36.049 --> 08:37.414
Do you know where he is?

08:37.417 --> 08:38.582
Is he okay?

08:38.583 --> 08:41.419
Oh, God.

08:41.421 --> 08:44.188
Nobody told you?

08:44.190 --> 08:45.856
Told me what?

08:48.827 --> 08:51.929
Oh. It's you.

08:53.032 --> 08:55.699
Taylor, are you okay?

08:55.701 --> 08:57.168
I'm sorry.
Are we friends today?

08:57.170 --> 08:59.403
It's just...
it's so hard to keep track.

08:59.405 --> 09:01.639
What is going on?

09:03.075 --> 09:04.942
Michael took Katy from me.

09:04.944 --> 09:08.779
- He won't let me see her.
- Why would he do that?

09:08.781 --> 09:11.115
He thinks
Katy's safer with him.

09:11.117 --> 09:15.119
Because of what happened
with Blanca and Louie Becker.

09:15.121 --> 09:17.855
Oh, my God.
Not you too.

09:17.857 --> 09:19.457
Michael thinks you're involved,
doesn't he?

09:19.459 --> 09:22.426
Actually, that's why I'm here.

09:22.428 --> 09:25.362
Look, I know about
the blood on your sofa.

09:25.364 --> 09:27.031
Get out.

09:27.033 --> 09:28.933
Taylor, I could've gone to the
police, but I'm your friend...

09:28.935 --> 09:30.935
You are not my friend!

09:30.937 --> 09:33.178
Friends don't
accuse each other of murder!

09:34.473 --> 09:35.873
Get out.

09:35.875 --> 09:37.074
I know you're not a killer,

09:37.076 --> 09:38.776
but I think you know
what happened.

09:38.778 --> 09:41.212
Do I have to
grab you and throw you out?

09:48.553 --> 09:49.854
Taylor...

09:53.259 --> 09:56.127
Spence...

09:58.763 --> 10:01.765
How could someone
do this to you?

10:01.767 --> 10:04.135
You have been so good to me,

10:04.137 --> 10:07.571
and I have been
terrible to you.

10:09.241 --> 10:11.108
I never should have left.

10:11.563 --> 10:16.113
And I promise
to love you forever...

10:16.115 --> 10:18.527
if you can forgive me.

10:19.451 --> 10:21.552
Can you?

10:23.288 --> 10:26.624
Can I ask you something first?

10:26.626 --> 10:31.529
Of course. Anything.

10:32.480 --> 10:34.498
Who are you?

10:39.825 --> 10:42.322
I was working for you
and your wife, Peri,

10:42.357 --> 10:45.331
but we fell in love,
so we got married.

10:45.392 --> 10:48.493
But then Ernesto came back,
my first husband.

10:48.495 --> 10:52.930
I thought he was dead,
but he wasn't.

10:52.932 --> 10:55.099
Does any of this
sound familiar?

10:55.101 --> 10:57.502
It sounds crazy.

10:57.504 --> 10:59.337
Yeah, I can't even
follow that story,

10:59.339 --> 11:00.738
and my memory's fine.

11:00.740 --> 11:04.275
Can we talk outside?

11:04.277 --> 11:07.145
Spence, I'll be right back.

11:07.147 --> 11:09.180
Thanks, um...

11:09.182 --> 11:11.983
- Rosie.
- Right.

11:14.920 --> 11:17.321
Jerry, why didn't you tell me
he was here?

11:17.323 --> 11:18.790
I just found out!

11:18.792 --> 11:22.260
I was in Hawaii last week.
So beautiful!

11:22.262 --> 11:24.503
Of course, my boyfriend and I
hardly left the hotel room.

11:25.464 --> 11:26.531
Not the time.

11:26.533 --> 11:28.433
Why can't Spence remember me?

11:28.435 --> 11:30.368
Well, I spoke to the doctor,
and apparently,

11:30.370 --> 11:33.104
this kind of memory loss can
happen with severe head trauma.

11:33.106 --> 11:35.173
But his memory will get better?

11:35.175 --> 11:36.607
Maybe.

11:36.609 --> 11:38.876
The good news is,
he knows who he is.

11:38.878 --> 11:41.612
It just seems like the last
few years are kind of a blur.

11:41.614 --> 11:43.281
How is that good news?

11:43.283 --> 11:46.050
With the beating he got,
he's lucky to be alive.

11:46.052 --> 11:48.686
This doesn't make any sense.

11:48.688 --> 11:50.888
I heard someone broke in
and attacked him,

11:50.890 --> 11:52.523
but nothing was missing.

11:52.525 --> 11:54.692
Can you think of anyone
who would want to hurt Spence?

11:58.797 --> 12:01.666
Yes. I can.

12:05.070 --> 12:08.539
So, listen...
I'm not going back to therapy.

12:08.541 --> 12:10.208
But we were making progress.

12:10.210 --> 12:12.176
You spent the whole hour
flirting

12:12.178 --> 12:13.878
to make the therapist like you.

12:13.880 --> 12:18.015
I wasn't flirting.
I'm naturally adorable.

12:18.017 --> 12:20.885
If you have a problem with that,
take it up with God.

12:20.887 --> 12:23.988
I said I would give
therapy a chance, and I did.

12:23.990 --> 12:26.424
But now I'm done.

12:28.094 --> 12:30.895
Maybe the real problem
is that you're stubborn.

12:30.897 --> 12:32.597
You never let things go.

12:32.599 --> 12:33.898
Well, that is your opinion.

12:33.900 --> 12:37.335
Not just mine.
Javier agrees with me.

12:39.505 --> 12:40.785
You talked to Javi?

12:41.940 --> 12:44.208
I have a feeling
whatever I'm going to say next

12:44.210 --> 12:46.177
will be wrong,
so... bye.

12:46.179 --> 12:47.912
Don't mess with me.

12:47.914 --> 12:51.682
I'm a hundred months' pregnant
and raging with hormones!

12:51.684 --> 12:52.917
Start talking.

12:56.421 --> 12:58.289
It was completely innocent.

12:58.291 --> 13:01.893
I ran into Javier at dinner
one night.

13:01.895 --> 13:04.762
And then we had coffee
a few times after that.

13:04.764 --> 13:05.863
Oh, my God!

13:05.865 --> 13:07.865
I was helping, I swear.

13:07.867 --> 13:09.800
I begged him to take you back.

13:09.802 --> 13:12.203
Get this through
your thick wig.

13:12.205 --> 13:15.773
Stay out of my life!

13:15.775 --> 13:17.942
I guess you're right.

13:17.944 --> 13:20.278
There's no point
going back to therapy.

13:20.280 --> 13:22.079
Oh.

13:22.081 --> 13:25.883
We are going to therapy...
right now.

13:28.921 --> 13:31.255
Marisol.
Did Taylor send you?

13:31.257 --> 13:33.257
Because I already told her
that Katy's staying with me.

13:33.259 --> 13:34.592
No, that's not why I'm here.

13:34.594 --> 13:35.927
Then what?

13:35.929 --> 13:38.062
I think Taylor's
covering for a murderer,

13:38.064 --> 13:39.497
and I think you agree.

13:47.439 --> 13:50.107
Thank you for finally
selling the house, Sebastien.

13:50.109 --> 13:51.509
The commission should keep you

13:51.511 --> 13:53.244
in baguettes and brie
for years to come.

13:54.681 --> 13:58.115
Well, one more signature,
and we're finished.

13:58.117 --> 13:59.650
Mr. Powell?

14:02.988 --> 14:04.188
No.

14:04.190 --> 14:07.091
"No"?
What do you mean, "no"?

14:07.093 --> 14:09.794
Is something wrong
with the offer?

14:09.796 --> 14:11.195
It's well above
the asking price.

14:11.197 --> 14:13.598
And yet I've decided
not to sell.

14:15.267 --> 14:17.969
Oh, you hideous slug of a man.

14:17.971 --> 14:21.372
Mr. Powell, I worked for months
to find you a buyer.

14:21.374 --> 14:22.807
And in that time, I've realized

14:22.809 --> 14:26.310
this home holds
a special place in my heart.

14:27.879 --> 14:30.214
Our son was born here.

14:30.216 --> 14:31.849
Don't you dare
bring Barrett into this!

14:31.851 --> 14:34.318
- I know what you're doing.
- What is he doing?

14:34.320 --> 14:35.820
I'm divorcing him,
but if we can't sell the house,

14:35.822 --> 14:37.902
it's impossible
to divide the assets.

14:39.157 --> 14:40.658
He's trapping me.

14:40.660 --> 14:41.726
I am.

14:41.728 --> 14:43.227
Look how well you know me.

14:43.229 --> 14:44.262
See?

14:47.332 --> 14:48.633
We belong together.

14:52.004 --> 14:53.237
Hey!

14:53.239 --> 14:56.307
If you don't sell,
I don't get paid!

14:56.309 --> 14:58.709
I'm terribly sorry about that.

14:59.411 --> 15:00.878
No, wait.

15:00.880 --> 15:02.780
I don't care.

15:04.683 --> 15:06.884
You sent Louie Becker
to spy on Taylor?

15:06.886 --> 15:08.252
I wanted to prove
she was sleeping around,

15:08.254 --> 15:09.754
but I never
heard from him again.

15:09.756 --> 15:11.188
The next morning...

15:11.190 --> 15:12.890
- His leg was on Evelyn's lawn.
- Yeah.

15:12.892 --> 15:15.192
I can't see Taylor
chopping up a body

15:15.194 --> 15:16.527
and throwing the parts
all over town.

15:16.529 --> 15:17.728
Yeah,
it must've been her lover.

15:17.730 --> 15:20.164
But nobody knows who he is.

15:20.166 --> 15:22.099
- Katy does.
- What?

15:22.101 --> 15:23.901
Katy was home that night.

15:23.903 --> 15:26.404
She told me that Taylor had a
man over when I was out of town.

15:26.406 --> 15:28.172
Taylor claimed that
he was a delivery guy, but...

15:28.174 --> 15:30.308
Oh, my God.
Katy saw the killer?

15:31.410 --> 15:33.511
Katy, sweetie!

15:33.513 --> 15:35.780
Katy?

15:35.782 --> 15:37.181
Yes?

15:37.183 --> 15:39.103
<i>Police! Open the door, now!</i>

15:42.854 --> 15:44.221
What the hell's going on?

15:44.223 --> 15:45.756
Michael Stappord,
you're under arrest

15:45.758 --> 15:47.958
for the murders of
Louie Becker and Blanca Alvarez.

15:47.960 --> 15:49.093
What?
I-I didn't do anything!

15:49.095 --> 15:50.628
This is a big mistake.

15:50.630 --> 15:52.363
Your wife turned you in.
Hands behind your back.

15:52.365 --> 15:54.198
- Daddy!
- H-Hold on. What are you doing?

15:54.200 --> 15:55.466
We're taking her
back to her mother.

15:55.468 --> 15:56.901
My wife is a liar.

15:56.903 --> 15:58.336
You have the right
to remain silent.

15:58.338 --> 16:01.057
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

16:11.488 --> 16:12.488
Can I help you?

16:12.490 --> 16:14.990
Oh. Hi.
Um, where's Sebastien?

16:14.992 --> 16:17.193
He's out, meeting with clients.

16:17.195 --> 16:18.494
Oh.

16:18.496 --> 16:19.862
Are you his maid?

16:19.864 --> 16:21.430
No.

16:21.432 --> 16:23.365
I'm his fiancée.
Who are you?

16:23.367 --> 16:26.268
I'm...
I'm Sebastien's yoga instructor.

16:26.270 --> 16:28.771
You teach yoga
dressed like that?

16:28.773 --> 16:30.439
You know what?

16:30.441 --> 16:33.809
I think I'm actually gonna
come back a little later.

16:37.113 --> 16:39.348
That cheating son of a bitch!

16:52.696 --> 16:54.096
Yep.

16:54.098 --> 16:56.465
Definitely not flirting
in those shoes.

16:56.467 --> 16:58.033
I'm sorry.

16:58.035 --> 17:00.202
I just don't feel
emotionally available in flats.

17:00.204 --> 17:01.737
Well, you can wear
whatever you want,

17:01.739 --> 17:03.906
but that doctor's not
gonna be on your side today.

17:05.710 --> 17:06.910
What the hell?

17:11.414 --> 17:14.148
A-Are you sure you pressed
the button all the way in?

17:14.151 --> 17:16.585
I know how to press a button!

17:18.549 --> 17:20.990
I guess I should call
Dr. Haskell and explain.

17:20.992 --> 17:25.426
Oh, honestly.
No reception at all?

17:25.429 --> 17:27.963
You got to be kidding me.

17:27.964 --> 17:29.164
I know.

17:29.166 --> 17:31.100
I should probably change
providers.

17:31.102 --> 17:33.168
No, it's not that.

17:33.170 --> 17:35.237
My water just broke.

17:40.110 --> 17:42.244
Hey, hey, hey.

17:42.246 --> 17:43.312
Rosita?

17:43.314 --> 17:46.982
Spence is really beat up!
He is in the hospital.

17:48.208 --> 17:50.519
Spence is alive?
Oh, thank God.

17:50.521 --> 17:51.687
Did you do this?

17:51.689 --> 17:54.290
No, Rosita, I swear...
it wasn't me.

17:54.292 --> 17:56.926
But you know who it was.

17:56.928 --> 17:59.461
Someone from the cartel.

17:59.463 --> 18:03.065
- But I promise he won't be back.
- How can you be so sure?

18:04.601 --> 18:06.435
I just am.

18:06.437 --> 18:08.771
So, how is Spence?
Is he gonna be okay?

18:09.873 --> 18:11.607
I don't know.

18:11.609 --> 18:12.975
He lost his memory.

18:12.977 --> 18:14.276
Oh, my God.

18:14.278 --> 18:16.598
He doesn't even know who I am.

18:17.714 --> 18:20.115
What am I gonna do?

18:20.117 --> 18:22.284
You have to help him remember.

18:23.954 --> 18:26.121
Remind him
of your life together.

18:26.123 --> 18:27.957
Believe me, Rosita,

18:27.959 --> 18:30.159
you're a very difficult woman
to forget.

18:30.161 --> 18:34.163
Why do you care what happens
between me and Spence?

18:34.165 --> 18:37.199
Because I want you to be happy.

18:37.201 --> 18:40.235
I think Spence is a good man,

18:40.237 --> 18:42.471
and I trust him
to take care of you.

18:46.242 --> 18:48.544
You're leaving.

18:48.546 --> 18:52.114
You said you wanted
me out of your life.

18:52.116 --> 18:54.817
Is that still true?

18:58.555 --> 18:59.955
Yes.

19:04.093 --> 19:06.461
I'm going back to México.

19:06.463 --> 19:08.030
I have to make sure the cartel

19:08.032 --> 19:10.899
will never come after
you and Miguel.

19:12.436 --> 19:14.870
I have to settle things
once and for all.

19:14.872 --> 19:17.039
When are you telling Miguel?

19:17.041 --> 19:20.142
I thought it might be easier
for him to hear it from you.

19:20.144 --> 19:22.778
You can't leave
without saying goodbye.

19:22.780 --> 19:25.414
Ernesto...

19:25.416 --> 19:28.717
you've already broken my heart.

19:28.719 --> 19:30.886
Don't break your son's, too.

19:35.258 --> 19:37.059
Okay, Katy. I already packed up
your clothes.

19:37.061 --> 19:38.927
Why don't you grab some toys
that you want,

19:38.929 --> 19:41.329
and I'll help you in a minute.

19:44.133 --> 19:45.868
Going somewhere?

19:48.605 --> 19:50.906
Marisol?
How did you...?

19:50.908 --> 19:54.142
I used to work here, remember?
Still have the key.

19:54.144 --> 19:55.811
Why is Katy
packing up her things?

19:55.813 --> 19:59.648
I already kicked you out once.
This is breaking and entering.

19:59.650 --> 20:01.350
Oh, no.

20:01.352 --> 20:03.852
Should we call the police?

20:03.854 --> 20:07.489
Of course, then I'm gonna
have to tell them

20:07.491 --> 20:09.091
everything I've learned.

20:10.827 --> 20:13.462
Marisol, please...

20:13.464 --> 20:15.597
Katy was here
the night Louie was killed.

20:15.599 --> 20:17.599
She saw the man that
you were having an affair with.

20:17.601 --> 20:20.802
You leave Katy out of this.
She is just a little girl.

20:20.804 --> 20:23.038
The police are gonna ask her
all sorts of questions.

20:23.040 --> 20:24.339
Do you want to
put her through all that?

20:24.341 --> 20:25.507
Why are you doing this?!

20:25.509 --> 20:29.211
You're my friend, Taylor.
But so was Blanca.

20:29.213 --> 20:32.614
And the man you were sleeping
with killed her, didn't he?

20:35.318 --> 20:37.653
Yes.

20:37.655 --> 20:41.356
But I never meant
for any of this to happen.

20:41.358 --> 20:44.526
Then tell me the truth.
Who is he?

20:46.896 --> 20:50.532
You have to understand.
I was lonely.

20:50.534 --> 20:55.470
<i>Michael was gone all the time,
and I had Katy all to myself.</i>

20:55.472 --> 20:58.340
<i>She seemed so unhappy.</i>

20:58.342 --> 21:01.410
<i>I felt like a terrible mother.</i>

21:01.412 --> 21:05.113
<i>I just needed
someone to talk to, anyone.</i>

21:06.680 --> 21:08.539
<i>And there he was.</i>

21:12.188 --> 21:16.137
- I'm Sebastien.
- Hi. I'm Taylor.

21:17.061 --> 21:19.528
Wait. Sebastien Dussault
is the killer?

21:19.530 --> 21:21.063
He's the man
you were sleeping with?

21:21.065 --> 21:24.166
- You know him?
- Oh, my God.

21:24.168 --> 21:25.701
Carmen.

22:00.703 --> 22:02.304
What?

22:02.306 --> 22:03.538
Carmen?

22:07.210 --> 22:10.245
I gave this dress to Blanca.
Why do you have it?

22:10.247 --> 22:13.148
I really wish
you hadn't found that.

22:19.474 --> 22:20.807
Did you kill Blanca?

22:22.343 --> 22:25.646
Please, you have to understand.
I did it for us.

22:25.648 --> 22:27.814
- What?
- I had no choice.

22:27.816 --> 22:30.917
She knew things.
And I couldn't go to jail.

22:30.919 --> 22:34.254
- I couldn't be away from you.
- Oh, my God.

22:34.256 --> 22:37.691
I trusted you.
I loved you.

22:37.693 --> 22:39.826
I was going to spend
the rest of my life with you.

22:39.828 --> 22:42.029
- We still can.
- No, no.

22:42.031 --> 22:45.065
This can't be happening.

22:52.006 --> 22:53.974
Aah!

22:55.376 --> 22:57.696
I don't want to hurt you,
<i>mon coeur.</i>

23:05.219 --> 23:06.586
It's your friend Marisol.

23:06.588 --> 23:10.057
She wants to talk to you.
She thinks I'm dangerous.

23:10.059 --> 23:13.226
She must have figured it out.
She knows what you did.

23:13.228 --> 23:15.529
Well, I guess I'm gonna have to
take care of her, too.

23:20.968 --> 23:24.237
You said you weren't having
this baby for another month!

23:24.239 --> 23:26.473
I'm not thrilled about it,
either.

23:26.475 --> 23:28.241
Here, help me
pry these doors open.

23:28.243 --> 23:31.144
Oh!
You know I just had a manicure.

23:31.146 --> 23:32.713
And you say I'm selfish?

23:35.950 --> 23:37.417
What are you doing?

23:37.419 --> 23:40.620
Well, when the cute firemen
come to rescue us,

23:40.622 --> 23:41.822
I want to look my best.

23:43.392 --> 23:47.127
Genevieve, no cute firemen
are coming to rescue us.

23:47.129 --> 23:48.662
Well, maybe not you.

23:48.664 --> 23:50.764
You look a little sweaty
right now.

23:50.766 --> 23:52.733
Listen to me.

23:52.735 --> 23:57.003
I know this is scary,
but we are on our own,

23:57.005 --> 23:59.239
so I need your help.

23:59.241 --> 24:01.775
You're gonna have to
deliver this baby.

24:05.079 --> 24:06.913
The hell I am.

24:20.328 --> 24:21.695
How did you do that?

24:21.697 --> 24:24.264
The thought of seeing
your unwaxed lady parts

24:24.266 --> 24:26.199
gave me superhuman strength.

24:30.037 --> 24:32.472
Wait!
You can't fit through there.

24:32.474 --> 24:33.640
Watch me.

24:41.149 --> 24:44.684
I've been dieting my whole life
for this!

24:44.686 --> 24:47.187
Go, you skinny bitch!

24:52.994 --> 24:54.027
Miguel!

24:54.029 --> 24:55.996
<i>Papá!</i>

24:57.131 --> 24:58.698
Are you picking me up today?

25:00.402 --> 25:02.235
No,<i> mijo.</i> I...

25:02.237 --> 25:05.672
I have to go away for a while,
so...

25:05.674 --> 25:07.340
I'm here to say goodbye.

25:07.342 --> 25:09.209
Where are you going?

25:10.561 --> 25:12.712
I've done some bad things,

25:12.714 --> 25:15.348
so I need to
go make them right.

25:15.350 --> 25:17.651
I want you to be proud of me.

25:17.653 --> 25:19.920
I am proud of you.

25:19.922 --> 25:22.022
Don't worry,<i> mijo.</i>

25:22.024 --> 25:23.523
You'll see me again someday.

25:23.525 --> 25:26.660
<i>In the meantime,
you take care of your mamá.</i>

25:26.662 --> 25:28.562
Okay? Hmm?

25:28.564 --> 25:31.998
Wait! Don't go!

25:36.204 --> 25:38.572
<i>Te quiero mucho,</i> Miguel.

25:41.776 --> 25:43.944
No! Come back!

25:43.946 --> 25:47.614
<i>Papá! Papá!</i>
<i>Por favor!</i>

25:47.616 --> 25:50.884
Come back! Come back!

25:53.944 --> 25:58.525
<i>Santo Dios!</i>
Sebastien is the killer?

25:58.527 --> 26:00.594
Where is Carmen?
Have you told her?

26:00.596 --> 26:03.230
She sent me a text. I'm meeting
her at the Powells' house now.

26:03.232 --> 26:05.065
Maybe I should join you.

26:05.067 --> 26:06.867
No, you've got your hands full
with Spence.

26:06.869 --> 26:09.536
As soon as I talk to Carmen,
we'll go to the police.

26:09.538 --> 26:11.271
Okay.
Good luck.

26:11.273 --> 26:13.707
Let me know
if you need... me.

26:18.379 --> 26:19.980
Katy?

26:40.565 --> 26:42.769
_

26:47.175 --> 26:48.608
Come in!

26:48.610 --> 26:51.745
Evelyn, have you seen Carmen?
She's supposed to meet me here.

26:51.747 --> 26:54.481
I'm just moving some of
Adrian's things to the study.

26:54.483 --> 26:55.682
You're not listening to me.

26:55.684 --> 26:57.751
Oh, good.
Then we're clear on that.

27:00.021 --> 27:01.321
Hello, Marisol.

27:01.323 --> 27:02.989
Don't talk to him.
We're divorcing.

27:02.991 --> 27:05.258
Sorry to hear that, but I really
need to find Car... men.

27:05.260 --> 27:06.960
What's all that?

27:06.962 --> 27:08.461
Since you won't go through with
the sale of the house,

27:08.463 --> 27:10.163
I'm banishing you
to the East wing.

27:10.165 --> 27:11.798
The East wing?

27:11.800 --> 27:14.534
But there's no kitchen or
swimming pool in the East wing.

27:14.536 --> 27:16.369
It's the Siberia of our house.

27:16.371 --> 27:17.871
Oh, I'm sure you'll manage.

27:17.873 --> 27:19.372
I've left you
some of your favorite things.

27:19.374 --> 27:20.674
Do you think
Carmen's in the pool house?

27:20.676 --> 27:22.842
Handcuffs, restraints...

27:22.844 --> 27:24.611
I never want to see these
disgusting things again.

27:24.613 --> 27:27.047
Guys, I am really sorry that
you're going through something,

27:27.049 --> 27:28.782
but I need to find Carmen.

27:28.784 --> 27:30.684
She's right here.

27:40.721 --> 27:44.357
I'm so sorry, Marisol.
You were right about him.

27:44.359 --> 27:45.625
He's a terrible man.

27:46.560 --> 27:49.262
Maybe we just don't
talk about that right now.

27:49.264 --> 27:51.431
Evelyn, let me say
how wonderful it was of you

27:51.433 --> 27:53.399
to place all of
the cuffs and restraints

27:53.401 --> 27:55.702
in one convenient location
for our kidnapper.

27:55.704 --> 27:58.271
Please, it was your
insatiable pervertedness

27:58.273 --> 27:59.572
that put them there
in the first place.

27:59.574 --> 28:01.908
Quiet!
I'm sick of both of you!

28:01.910 --> 28:04.444
Sebastien, please, these people
have done nothing to you.

28:04.446 --> 28:05.612
Don't hurt them.

28:05.614 --> 28:07.547
Nobody has to get hurt.

28:07.549 --> 28:09.415
I just need money
to get out of town.

28:09.417 --> 28:11.251
I worked for you for months.

28:11.253 --> 28:15.288
- You owe me my commission.
- Oh, I owe you nothing.

28:19.527 --> 28:21.728
You can't get money from me
if I'm dead.

28:21.730 --> 28:24.264
So go ahead...
threaten me, torture me...

28:24.266 --> 28:26.107
I'm not giving you a cent.

28:28.536 --> 28:31.070
Torturing you would be a waste.

28:31.072 --> 28:33.406
You would enjoy it too much.

28:34.642 --> 28:37.477
Ah.

28:37.479 --> 28:40.780
Ooh.

28:40.782 --> 28:43.416
But I'm sure you wouldn't
want Mrs. Powell to suffer.

28:44.920 --> 28:46.886
Fine!

28:46.888 --> 28:48.254
You'll get your money.

28:50.324 --> 28:51.791
I told you I was innocent.

28:51.793 --> 28:53.660
It took some time
to verify your alibi.

28:53.662 --> 28:55.461
The airline did confirm
that you were, indeed,

28:55.463 --> 28:58.064
on a flight to Boston the night
that Louie Becker was murdered.

28:58.066 --> 29:00.300
And what about my wife?
She lied.

29:00.302 --> 29:02.936
She used you to
get our daughter away from me.

29:02.938 --> 29:04.237
I'm sending officers
to pick her up.

29:04.239 --> 29:06.072
Good.
I want my daughter back.

29:10.277 --> 29:12.679
This is not a good time, Adrian.
I'm in the middle of something.

29:12.681 --> 29:14.614
Well, that makes two of us.

29:14.616 --> 29:18.117
I need money... now.

29:22.122 --> 29:25.291
Thank you so much.
The service was wonderful.

29:25.293 --> 29:27.393
Ma'am, we can't accept tips.

29:30.698 --> 29:33.032
I would definitely
use them again.

29:34.636 --> 29:37.003
What? Why are you
looking at me like that?

29:37.005 --> 29:38.938
You were amazing today.

29:38.940 --> 29:43.843
I take back everything I said.
You're not selfish.

29:43.845 --> 29:45.812
I just had a thought.

29:45.814 --> 29:47.947
You should name the baby
Genevieve.

29:47.949 --> 29:50.683
Maybe I spoke too soon.

29:50.685 --> 29:53.686
But I do want my job back.

29:55.356 --> 29:59.158
I'm so glad.

29:59.160 --> 30:04.063
Zoila, I need to
apologize to you.

30:04.065 --> 30:06.065
I never should have
contacted Javier.

30:06.067 --> 30:08.901
It's okay.

30:08.903 --> 30:11.237
I know,
in your own demented way,

30:11.239 --> 30:13.039
you were just trying to help.

30:13.041 --> 30:16.376
Honestly, I thought
if you got back with him,

30:16.378 --> 30:18.311
you'd have help with the baby.

30:18.313 --> 30:19.846
I mean,
what good am I gonna be?

30:19.848 --> 30:24.717
Genevieve,
you're so incredible.

30:24.719 --> 30:28.221
And right now, there's
nobody else I'd want by my side.

30:28.223 --> 30:30.923
Well, maybe Valentina.

30:30.925 --> 30:32.725
But you're a close second.

30:32.727 --> 30:34.227
Zoila, it's time, huh?

30:34.229 --> 30:35.662
We have a labor room
ready for you.

30:35.664 --> 30:37.063
I guess that's my cue.

30:37.065 --> 30:39.699
You get settled.

30:39.701 --> 30:41.501
I'll take care of
the paperwork.

30:41.503 --> 30:43.002
I love you.

30:43.004 --> 30:46.039
I love you, too.

30:46.041 --> 30:48.675
- Okay.
- Okay.

30:51.545 --> 30:53.513
Aah!

31:01.355 --> 31:03.956
Michael,
we've been expecting you.

31:03.958 --> 31:05.425
Is Adrian here?
He asked me to bring...

31:05.427 --> 31:07.026
Bring us some money, yeah.

31:07.028 --> 31:08.795
Is that it?
I can just take it to him.

31:08.797 --> 31:10.063
You can be on your way.

31:10.065 --> 31:11.531
Hold on a second.

31:11.533 --> 31:13.900
Why do you need this much cash?

31:13.902 --> 31:15.301
Where's Adrian?

31:15.303 --> 31:18.037
He's indisposed at the moment.

31:18.039 --> 31:19.872
Evelyn, what in the hell
is going on?

31:19.874 --> 31:22.709
This is what's going on.

31:26.613 --> 31:27.980
Ow!

31:27.982 --> 31:29.882
These handcuffs
are digging into my skin.

31:29.884 --> 31:32.785
Well, pardon me for the poor
craftsmanship of my sex toys.

31:32.787 --> 31:35.307
They weren't intended
for hostage-taking.

31:37.891 --> 31:40.126
That's right.
They weren't.

31:40.128 --> 31:41.794
Carmen, I need a bobby pin.

31:41.796 --> 31:43.796
Yeah.
Your hair is a mess.

31:43.798 --> 31:46.099
Carmen, just give it to me!
They're coming!

31:51.505 --> 31:53.773
<i>Get in.</i>

31:53.775 --> 31:54.941
<i>Get in there!</i>

31:54.943 --> 31:57.143
<i>- Quiet!
- I'm so sorry.</i>

32:00.848 --> 32:03.416
Tie up Mr. Stappord.
Use these.

32:03.418 --> 32:04.784
Marisol?

32:04.786 --> 32:06.419
How'd you get into this mess?

32:06.421 --> 32:09.288
Well, I found out who Taylor
was having an affair with.

32:09.290 --> 32:10.923
What, this guy?

32:10.925 --> 32:13.659
Wait. I thought you were
sleeping with Carmen.

32:13.661 --> 32:16.262
He sleeps with everyone!
He's a man-whore.

32:16.264 --> 32:18.765
Listen,<i> mon coeur,</i> you have to
understand, that was just a job.

32:18.767 --> 32:21.768
- Taylor meant nothing to me.
- What do you mean, a job?

32:21.770 --> 32:23.669
Olivia hired him
to seduce Taylor.

32:23.671 --> 32:25.471
She was trying to break up
the Stappords' marriage.

32:25.473 --> 32:28.040
We only slept together once.

32:28.042 --> 32:29.342
Taylor told me what happened.

32:29.344 --> 32:31.344
It was
the night of my book party.

32:33.213 --> 32:34.647
<i>Michael was out of town.</i>

32:34.649 --> 32:35.882
<i>Katy was asleep.</i>

32:35.884 --> 32:37.850
<i>They thought
they were all alone.</i>

32:37.852 --> 32:40.953
<i>But we weren't.</i>

32:40.955 --> 32:42.789
Well, isn't this romantic?

32:42.791 --> 32:45.358
<i>Michael had sent Louie Becker
to the house to spy on Taylor.</i>

32:45.360 --> 32:46.893
Oh, my God.

32:46.895 --> 32:48.895
Who are you? What the hell
are you doing here?

32:48.897 --> 32:50.897
Making sure her husband
gets his money's worth.

32:50.899 --> 32:52.231
Michael? But...

32:52.233 --> 32:53.800
Yeah, he thinks
you're having an affair.

32:53.802 --> 32:55.001
I guess he was right, huh?

32:55.003 --> 32:56.869
<i>I couldn't
risk my wife finding out</i>

32:56.871 --> 32:58.137
<i>I was cheating on her.</i>

32:58.139 --> 33:00.673
<i>So, we got into a fight.</i>

33:00.675 --> 33:02.008
Stop it! Stop!

33:07.414 --> 33:09.615
<i>And Louie Becker
wound up dead.</i>

33:13.320 --> 33:14.854
<i>But while they were arguing
about how to</i>

33:14.856 --> 33:17.790
<i>cover up the murder,
Katy walked in on them.</i>

33:17.792 --> 33:19.826
Mommy?

33:19.828 --> 33:21.194
Sweetheart, honey!

33:21.196 --> 33:22.462
What are you doing up?

33:22.464 --> 33:23.996
I heard noises.

33:24.965 --> 33:28.778
Um, well, uh, let's just
get you back to bed, okay?

33:30.338 --> 33:33.005
<i>Taylor hurried her back to bed,</i>

33:33.007 --> 33:37.410
<i>leaving Sebastien to
take matters into his own hands.</i>

33:57.498 --> 34:02.134
<i>When Taylor returned,
she found a gruesome scene.</i>

34:04.478 --> 34:08.875
I don't understand. How did
that damn leg end up on my lawn?

34:08.877 --> 34:11.043
I scattered the body parts
all over town

34:11.045 --> 34:12.545
to throw the police
off the trail.

34:12.547 --> 34:14.447
Well, clearly, you're
as skilled at covering murders

34:14.449 --> 34:15.947
as you are at selling houses.

34:15.949 --> 34:19.252
It was a bad situation.
I did what I had to do.

34:19.254 --> 34:20.953
I'm not a killer.

34:20.955 --> 34:22.355
Then why did you kill Blanca?

34:22.357 --> 34:24.223
Because Blanca
was in the wrong place

34:24.225 --> 34:25.690
at the wrong time.

34:25.693 --> 34:27.426
Blanca, wait.

34:27.428 --> 34:30.029
She surprised Taylor
and walked in on the bloody room

34:30.031 --> 34:31.964
before Taylor could
do anything about it.

34:31.966 --> 34:34.266
What the hell happened in here?

34:34.268 --> 34:36.569
<i>Blanca couldn't
keep her mouth shut.</i>

34:36.571 --> 34:39.038
<i>So he had to
take care of her, too.</i>

34:41.275 --> 34:43.809
<i>And since the police
were still looking for answers,</i>

34:43.811 --> 34:45.745
<i>he gave them one,
making it look like</i>

34:45.746 --> 34:48.281
<i>Blanca killed Louie
then herself.</i>

34:48.283 --> 34:51.516
<i>He even included a confession
so there'd be no doubt.</i>

34:52.886 --> 34:56.088
But you were with me
when we discovered the body.

34:56.090 --> 34:58.291
I needed someone to find it.

34:58.293 --> 35:01.594
And who better than the woman
known for finding dead bodies?

35:01.596 --> 35:04.730
You sick son of a bitch.
You slept with my wife.

35:04.732 --> 35:06.666
If you were a better husband,

35:06.668 --> 35:08.568
none of this
would have happened.

35:08.570 --> 35:10.136
You're dead.
You hear me?

35:10.138 --> 35:12.038
Soon as I get out of here,
I'm gonna kill you!

35:12.973 --> 35:13.973
Oh!

35:16.343 --> 35:18.044
Aah!

35:20.013 --> 35:23.115
I don't think you will.

35:26.565 --> 35:30.384
- Is he...?
- He's gone.

35:31.797 --> 35:34.169
Sebastien, you said
no one was gonna get hurt.

35:34.549 --> 35:37.217
I lied. And now that
you know the whole story,

35:37.219 --> 35:39.519
I'm afraid
I cannot let any of you go.

35:39.521 --> 35:41.287
What are you doing?

35:41.289 --> 35:44.457
I'm turning on the gas.
And once I'm safely outside,

35:44.459 --> 35:46.226
I will burn this house
to the ground.

35:51.065 --> 35:52.398
Are you all right, darling?

35:52.400 --> 35:55.502
- I'm frightened.
- Me too.

35:55.504 --> 35:59.005
An ordeal like this, it makes
you realize what's important.

36:00.875 --> 36:03.376
If somehow we manage
to get out of here...

36:03.378 --> 36:04.911
I want you to know,

36:04.913 --> 36:07.714
I'm going to be
the kind of husband you deserve.

36:07.716 --> 36:11.718
Adrian, I've spent
my entire adult life with you...

36:11.720 --> 36:14.320
and this ordeal
has made me realize

36:14.322 --> 36:16.956
what a terrible waste
that's been.

36:18.425 --> 36:20.326
<i>Mon coeur,</i>
looks like this is goodbye.

36:20.328 --> 36:22.095
Sebastien, wait!

36:22.097 --> 36:25.198
I understand
why you did what you did.

36:25.200 --> 36:26.600
You had to protect yourself.

36:28.769 --> 36:31.905
What are you saying?

36:31.907 --> 36:35.008
You're a selfish person,
Sebastien, but so am I.

36:35.010 --> 36:38.011
It's why we always
get along so well.

36:38.013 --> 36:41.881
You've done terrible things,
but I... I love you.

36:41.883 --> 36:44.284
And I want to
be with you forever.

36:54.461 --> 36:56.529
So you'll uncuff me?

36:56.531 --> 36:59.365
How stupid do you think I am?

37:04.939 --> 37:06.306
Very stupid.

37:06.308 --> 37:09.809
Marisol!
How did you get free?

37:09.811 --> 37:11.411
Sex handcuffs
aren't real handcuffs.

37:11.413 --> 37:12.445
Let's go.

37:12.447 --> 37:14.747
Let's go.

37:17.151 --> 37:19.252
Honey, stay close!

37:19.254 --> 37:21.554
<i>This is Marisol.</i>
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

37:21.556 --> 37:23.556
Hi. It's Taylor.

37:23.558 --> 37:27.660
I'm sorry to do this over the phone,
but Katy is my everything

37:27.662 --> 37:29.896
and I'd do anything
to protect her.

37:29.898 --> 37:31.931
I hope you understand.

37:31.933 --> 37:35.301
You're a good friend, Marisol.
I'm really gonna miss you.

37:35.303 --> 37:37.070
Goodbye.

37:40.574 --> 37:43.977
Come on, sweetie.

37:49.617 --> 37:52.085
Hello, there.
Checking in?

37:52.087 --> 37:54.287
Yes. Thank you.

37:54.289 --> 37:56.623
How long
will you be staying with us?

37:56.625 --> 37:58.825
Uh, just for the night.
Have to get back on the road.

37:58.827 --> 37:59.859
Okay. Name?

37:59.861 --> 38:02.161
I'm Abby Parker.

38:03.764 --> 38:05.431
And this is my daughter.

38:05.433 --> 38:07.100
Hi.

38:07.102 --> 38:09.102
I'm Rosie.

38:11.872 --> 38:13.706
I hope it's okay.

38:13.708 --> 38:15.875
I brought some pictures
to help you remember me.

38:15.877 --> 38:18.611
I don't need pictures.
I know exactly who you are.

38:18.613 --> 38:20.380
You do?
You're Rosie.

38:20.382 --> 38:23.650
I am Rosie!
You're right!

38:23.652 --> 38:25.051
How could I ever forget you?

38:25.053 --> 38:27.573
You're the best maid
my wife and I ever had.

38:28.322 --> 38:29.322
Your wife?

38:29.324 --> 38:30.957
Hello, Rosie.

38:30.959 --> 38:33.893
How sweet of you to stop by.

38:33.895 --> 38:36.963
Mrs. Peri...

38:36.965 --> 38:38.364
what are you doing here?

38:38.366 --> 38:40.033
Well, I called her.

38:40.035 --> 38:42.635
I was so confused, but she's
explained everything to me.

38:42.637 --> 38:44.871
Mm-hmm, and now that I'm here,
sweetheart,

38:44.873 --> 38:46.906
I'm not leaving your side.

38:46.908 --> 38:49.242
I'm right where I belong.

38:57.886 --> 39:00.820
Ohh!
Why does anybody do this?!

39:00.822 --> 39:02.388
I know it hurts.

39:02.390 --> 39:04.023
Are you sure you don't
want your friend in here?

39:04.025 --> 39:06.993
No! We have enough
boundary issues as it is.

39:10.932 --> 39:13.866
Doctor, could you
take a look at this?

39:13.868 --> 39:15.368
Zoila, how are you feeling?

39:15.370 --> 39:18.204
I'm cold.
Is it cold in here?

39:20.041 --> 39:21.708
Mom's crashing.

39:21.710 --> 39:23.676
Fetal heartbeat's
dropping.

39:23.678 --> 39:24.844
Zoila?

39:24.846 --> 39:28.214
Zoila.
I need a UR stat.

39:29.416 --> 39:33.453
Valentina, I hate that
I can't track you or Remi down.

39:33.455 --> 39:35.555
The baby will be here soon,

39:35.557 --> 39:39.926
so please call us back and
say hi to your little sister.

39:39.928 --> 39:42.228
- Mr Delatour...
- Is it happening?

39:42.230 --> 39:43.563
There's been
a complication.

39:43.565 --> 39:45.898
Zoila has
an amniotic fluid embolism.

39:45.900 --> 39:48.201
- A what?
- We need to move fast.

39:48.203 --> 39:50.136
We'll do our best
to save them both.

39:50.138 --> 39:52.138
But you need to tell me
who to prioritize...

39:52.140 --> 39:53.606
Zoila or her baby.

39:59.813 --> 40:01.948
So he's still inside, the man
responsible for the murders?

40:01.950 --> 40:03.382
His name is Sebastien Dussault.

40:03.384 --> 40:05.251
He also killed our friend
Michael Stappord.

40:05.253 --> 40:07.653
But you have to be very careful.
The house is filled with gas.

40:07.655 --> 40:09.422
He was gonna blow us all up!

40:09.424 --> 40:11.657
Okay, I'll let everyone know.
Excuse me.

40:11.659 --> 40:14.327
This is an absolute nightmare.
Adrian?

40:14.329 --> 40:17.063
Where is Adrian?

40:23.137 --> 40:25.638
Sebastien Dussault,
this is the police.

40:25.640 --> 40:27.673
We have the house surrounded.

40:27.675 --> 40:30.777
Come out with your hands up,
and you will not get hurt.

40:34.314 --> 40:36.182
You don't think
he went back inside.

40:47.428 --> 40:48.427
Oh, sh...

41:23.997 --> 41:26.365
Adrian!

41:29.036 --> 41:31.170
Adrian!
