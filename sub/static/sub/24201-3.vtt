01:33.791 --> 01:36.125
The episode you are about to watch,

01:37.208 --> 01:40.708
assuming your eyes are open
and tilted towards me,

01:41.666 --> 01:45.958
is a story which can teach you
the difference between the word "nervous"

01:48.458 --> 01:50.083
and the word "anxious."

02:00.416 --> 02:03.708
The word "nervous" means
"worried about something."

02:03.791 --> 02:06.916
The way you might feel if you were served
prune ice cream,

02:07.000 --> 02:09.041
because you'd be worried
it would taste awful.

02:09.125 --> 02:10.750
I'm nervous.

02:10.833 --> 02:15.000
"Anxious," on the other hand,
means "troubled by disturbing suspense."

02:15.083 --> 02:18.708
The way you might feel
if you were served a live alligator,

02:18.791 --> 02:21.541
because you'd be troubled by the suspense

02:21.625 --> 02:24.291
of whether you would eat your dessert
or it would eat you.

02:25.708 --> 02:26.750
I'm anxious.

02:34.125 --> 02:37.083
If you are thinking about the story
of the Baudelaire orphans,

02:37.166 --> 02:40.958
you might feel nervous
because you do not know how it ends.

02:41.041 --> 02:44.083
But if you are viewing this story,
you will be anxious and troubled

02:44.166 --> 02:49.375
by the disturbing suspense in which they
find themselves hopelessly trapped.

02:57.083 --> 02:59.750
Now, Baudelaires,
I know you must be nervous.

02:59.833 --> 03:02.416
I was a little nervous
trying to find you a new guardian,

03:02.500 --> 03:04.000
given your track record.

03:04.083 --> 03:07.000
But never fear.
This is a very fashionable block.

03:07.083 --> 03:09.291
Much more fashionable
than where you lived,

03:09.375 --> 03:10.875
even though it's a few blocks away.

03:10.958 --> 03:12.958
We're not concerned
with how fashionable it is.

03:13.041 --> 03:15.833
We're more than nervous, Mr. Poe.
We're anxious.

03:15.916 --> 03:17.416
Our friends have been kidnapped by Olaf.

03:17.500 --> 03:20.000
- Yes, the Quagmire twins.
- Triplets.

03:20.083 --> 03:22.791
- There's only two of them.
- Quigley died in a fire.

03:22.875 --> 03:26.208
Then no need to worry about him.
As for Dennis and Iphigenia...

03:26.291 --> 03:27.375
Duncan and Isadora.

03:28.125 --> 03:31.291
- Do you know what that is?
- A police car?

03:31.375 --> 03:35.583
A citywide manhunt to apprehend Olaf
and rescue your friends.

03:43.083 --> 03:46.041
We at Mulctuary Money Management
are co-sponsoring every effort

03:46.125 --> 03:48.083
to bring this ghastly villain to justice.

03:48.166 --> 03:50.708
Look at the wanted posters
we had pasted up all over town.

03:50.791 --> 03:53.291
You can't see them.
The trees are blocking the light.

03:53.375 --> 03:55.875
Trust me. It's a good likeness
of a very bad person.

03:55.958 --> 03:57.916
Once I have dropped you at this apartment

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
where old friends of your parents have
promised to be your guardians,

04:01.083 --> 04:04.333
I'm taking a helicopter ride
to search for the Quagmires

04:04.416 --> 04:07.541
using the binoculars my wife gave me
as an anniversary present.

04:07.791 --> 04:09.500
Now, let's see...

04:10.541 --> 04:14.666
Has anyone seen the numbers 667?

04:14.750 --> 04:16.958
It should be somewhere on this block.

04:17.041 --> 04:18.958
Another mysterious set
of our parents' friends.

04:19.041 --> 04:19.958
Who we've never met.

04:24.083 --> 04:28.916
Found the building. It's right next
to this lamppost I just ran into.

04:34.083 --> 04:34.916
Names?

04:35.000 --> 04:37.875
I'm Violet, and these are my siblings,
Klaus and Sunny.

04:37.958 --> 04:40.375
You're expected. But who's that
behind you with a nosebleed?

04:40.458 --> 04:41.500
This is a restricted area.

04:41.583 --> 04:44.000
Don't mind me.
I'm just dropping off the Baudelaires,

04:44.083 --> 04:47.708
and then I'm off to find a clinic
and/or bag of frozen peas

04:47.791 --> 04:49.125
before I miss my helicopter.

04:49.208 --> 04:50.791
Sorry.
No unauthorized parties allowed.

04:50.875 --> 04:52.208
There's a manhunt going on.

04:52.291 --> 04:54.416
Well, in that case, goodbye, Baudelaires.

04:54.500 --> 04:57.958
If you need to contact me,
remember I'll be in a helicopter

04:58.041 --> 05:00.875
and won't be reachable
at any moment at any time.

05:01.583 --> 05:04.208
- Friend of yours?
- Oh, he works at a bank.

05:04.916 --> 05:06.083
I know the type.

05:06.166 --> 05:09.541
In fact, you'll be staying with the city's
sixth most important financial adviser.

05:09.625 --> 05:11.416
Mr. and Mrs. Squalor
live in the penthouse,

05:11.500 --> 05:14.125
which is the top floor of 667 Dark Avenue,

05:14.208 --> 05:16.875
the most fashionable
and secure building in town.

05:16.958 --> 05:20.708
Count Olaf won't be able
to get in or out of this building.

05:20.791 --> 05:22.750
Sorry about the lighting. Dark is in.

05:22.833 --> 05:24.791
- In what?
- Just in.

05:24.875 --> 05:27.250
You can take these stairs
to the penthouse.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.166
Is the elevator out of order?

05:29.250 --> 05:32.333
I'm good with mechanical devices.
I'd be happy to look at it.

05:32.416 --> 05:36.208
A kind and unusual offer,
but it's not out of order. Just out.

05:36.291 --> 05:39.416
I'll phone the penthouse and tell them
to expect you within the hour.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.291
People who live in penthouses
are rich and powerful.

05:50.375 --> 05:52.375
I hope they can help us
find the Quagmires.

05:52.458 --> 05:54.708
We don't have a clue
where Olaf could have taken them.

05:54.791 --> 05:56.000
We're in the dark.

05:56.833 --> 05:59.541
The phrase "in the dark,"
which I'm sure you know,

05:59.625 --> 06:02.000
can refer to not only
one's shadowy surroundings,

06:02.083 --> 06:05.333
but also to the secrets
which might be surrounding you.

06:13.416 --> 06:16.791
Every day, the sun goes down
over all of these secrets,

06:16.875 --> 06:20.333
so everyone is in the dark
in one way or another.

06:21.375 --> 06:23.666
If you are sunbathing in the park,

06:23.750 --> 06:26.750
but you do not know
about the deep and dangerous pit nearby,

06:26.833 --> 06:30.000
then you are in the dark even though you
are not actually in the dark.

06:30.083 --> 06:31.250
If you are on a midnight hike

06:31.333 --> 06:34.666
knowing full well
that several ballerinas are following you,

06:34.750 --> 06:38.833
then you are not in the dark
even though you are in the dark.

06:38.916 --> 06:42.250
Of course, it is possible
to be in the dark in the dark,

06:42.333 --> 06:44.833
and to be not in the dark
not in the dark.

06:44.916 --> 06:46.833
But there are so many secrets
in this world

06:46.916 --> 06:49.833
that it is likely that you are
always in the dark about something,

06:49.916 --> 06:53.666
whether you're in the dark in the dark
or in the dark not in the dark.

06:53.750 --> 06:55.291
So you'll eventually fall

06:55.375 --> 06:58.458
into the deep and dangerous pit
dug by several ballerinas,

06:58.541 --> 07:01.666
which is dark in the dark in the park.

07:04.500 --> 07:05.333
That's odd.

07:06.833 --> 07:12.416
There's two sets of elevator doors. See?
On every other floor, there's just one.

07:21.833 --> 07:25.541
You must be the Baudelaires. Welcome.
The door's always unlocked.

07:25.625 --> 07:28.958
My name is Jerome Squalor.
I'm so happy you've come to stay with us.

07:30.041 --> 07:31.708
How do you do, Mr. Squalor?

07:31.791 --> 07:34.291
You must be out of breath from that climb.

07:34.375 --> 07:36.250
I can think of two things
to do about that.

07:36.333 --> 07:40.208
One, stop calling me Mr. Squalor
and start calling me Jerome.

07:40.291 --> 07:44.291
Number two, I am gonna make you
a nice, cold martini. Come this way.

07:46.333 --> 07:50.666
- A martini? Isn't that an alcoholic drink?
- Usually it is.

07:50.958 --> 07:55.125
But alcoholic martinis are out
and aqueous martinis are in.

07:55.208 --> 07:56.291
Aqueous martinis?

07:56.375 --> 07:58.833
It's just cold water in a fancy glass
with an olive in it.

08:00.291 --> 08:03.083
We've never had aqueous martinis before,
but we'll try them.

08:03.166 --> 08:06.875
You're adventurous,
just like your parents.

08:06.958 --> 08:09.541
I remember when we went up
to Mount Fraught

08:09.625 --> 08:13.250
and did high-impact bird-watching.
How many years ago was that?

08:13.958 --> 08:16.166
- Was Montgomery Montgomery there?
- Or Josephine Anwhistle?

08:16.250 --> 08:19.791
Who? No, I never met
any of your previous guardians.

08:19.875 --> 08:22.458
- You don't happen to own a spyglass?
- No.

08:22.541 --> 08:26.666
But one of the eagles flew off
with my best pair of binoculars that day.

08:27.500 --> 08:28.500
I was not happy.

08:29.083 --> 08:32.000
And then, soon after that, I lost touch
with your parents.

08:32.082 --> 08:33.416
You know how it is.

08:33.500 --> 08:35.500
You get older.
You find different interests.

08:36.041 --> 08:38.832
You marry a woman
who despises all of your old friends.

08:41.041 --> 08:44.500
But there's no need
to discuss such unpleasantness.

08:45.458 --> 08:48.291
I wanted to adopt you
the moment I heard about the fire.

08:48.791 --> 08:50.208
Unfortunately, it was impossible.

08:50.291 --> 08:52.041
Orphans were out then.

08:53.416 --> 08:55.250
But now they're in.

08:55.333 --> 08:57.958
- Good evening.
- It's mid-morning, my precious.

08:58.041 --> 09:00.625
I'm Esmé Gigi Geniveve Squalor,

09:00.708 --> 09:03.666
the city's sixth most important
financial adviser.

09:03.750 --> 09:07.541
Even though I am unbelievably wealthy,
you may call me Esmé.

09:07.625 --> 09:08.833
I'll learn your names later.

09:11.291 --> 09:13.583
I am very happy you're here.

09:13.666 --> 09:18.250
When all my friends hear
that I have three real live orphans,

09:18.333 --> 09:21.041
they'll be sick with jealousy.
Won't they, Jerome?

09:21.125 --> 09:23.708
I don't know. I don't like to hear
that anybody's sick.

09:23.791 --> 09:25.541
You'll have such a glamorous life with me

09:25.625 --> 09:27.958
that your friends' eyes
will roll back in their heads.

09:28.041 --> 09:31.666
You will be exposed
to all the innest restaurants,

09:31.750 --> 09:36.208
the innest boutiques, premieres,
cockfights, gallery openings.

09:36.291 --> 09:39.958
What my wife means is that we hope
you'll feel safe and secure.

09:40.041 --> 09:41.916
- Don't tell them silly things.
- Okay.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.125
Children, here are things you should know.

09:44.208 --> 09:48.791
Dark is in, light is out.
Stairs are in, elevators are out.

09:48.875 --> 09:53.166
- Pinstripe suits are...
- In.

09:53.750 --> 09:54.666
In.

09:54.750 --> 09:55.625
- In.
- Yes.

09:55.708 --> 09:58.500
Those horrible clothes you're wearing
are out.

09:58.583 --> 10:02.791
What my wife means is we hope
you'll feel comfortable while you're here.

10:02.875 --> 10:05.916
I feel awful about all
the terrible experiences you've had.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.458
This entire time,
we could've been taking care of you...

10:08.541 --> 10:09.875
It couldn't be helped.

10:09.958 --> 10:13.041
When something's out, it's out.
And orphans used to be out.

10:13.125 --> 10:15.166
We're glad you're interested
in orphans now,

10:15.250 --> 10:18.208
because we are concerned
about some of our friends.

10:18.291 --> 10:19.458
- Mmm.
- Oh...

10:19.541 --> 10:22.583
The Quagmires. I'm sure you're
anxious for them to be rescued.

10:22.666 --> 10:24.083
We are anxious.

10:24.166 --> 10:27.416
If there's one good thing
about being rich and powerful,

10:27.500 --> 10:29.791
it's you don't have to be anxious.

10:29.875 --> 10:33.583
After they're found, the Quagmires
will live right here with us.

10:33.666 --> 10:35.708
The more orphans the better.

10:36.708 --> 10:38.875
- It's handy to have a few spares.
- Okay.

10:38.958 --> 10:43.041
Rest at ease, Baudelaires.
You live in a penthouse now.

10:43.125 --> 10:45.375
You're never going to want
for anything again.

10:45.458 --> 10:47.291
All we want is for our friends to be safe.

10:47.375 --> 10:51.500
Well, I'm sure
we'll hear good news soon.

10:55.625 --> 11:00.666
Big fat fantastic news
about what we were just talking about!

11:00.750 --> 11:02.625
- Has Olaf been captured?
- The Quagmires rescued?

11:02.708 --> 11:04.083
Better.

11:04.166 --> 11:07.875
- Dark is out, light is in.
- Oh.

11:07.958 --> 11:10.791
We have to turn on lamps
and open curtains before anyone sees.

11:10.875 --> 11:12.458
Flip the light switches in the west wing.

11:12.541 --> 11:15.833
Baudelaires, open the curtains
in the living room.

11:15.916 --> 11:17.416
I'll run around in panicky circles.

11:27.791 --> 11:32.125
Something tells me the Squalors
won't be as helpful as we need them to be.

11:32.208 --> 11:35.000
Meanwhile, Olaf could be
getting further and further away.

11:41.791 --> 11:45.583
Does this seem like a nightmare?
A bad dream?

11:46.041 --> 11:48.541
Because that's the effect I was going for.

11:50.541 --> 11:53.958
Well, I have nightmares, too, orphans.

11:54.041 --> 11:56.750
I wake up
in the middle of the night screaming,

11:56.833 --> 11:58.750
and the only thing that comforts me

11:58.833 --> 12:01.958
is knowing the three of you
will soon be screaming.

12:02.041 --> 12:07.958
Just like another set of wealthy orphans
that happen to be in my clutches.

12:08.041 --> 12:09.791
- Duncan and Isadora.
- Where are they?

12:10.541 --> 12:12.375
You mean you don't know?

12:12.458 --> 12:15.166
I thought everybody
could smell wealthy orphans

12:15.250 --> 12:17.500
when they were in arm's reach.

12:17.583 --> 12:19.000
Well, not to worry.

12:19.083 --> 12:22.875
Soon all of you orphans
will be in my clutches.

12:22.958 --> 12:27.208
Quagmires in one clutch,
and you, Baudelaires, in the other.

12:27.291 --> 12:30.500
This pesky citywide manhunt
may have foreshadowed me

12:30.583 --> 12:33.125
from taking them far away,
but not for long.

12:33.208 --> 12:36.041
You mean "forestalled."
But we're gonna stop you.

12:36.125 --> 12:38.375
- Mr. and Mrs. Squalor!
- Olaf is here!

12:38.458 --> 12:40.291
- What?
- It can't be!

12:41.583 --> 12:42.500
Did I hear you right?

12:42.583 --> 12:46.750
How did he get past the doorperson?
How did he slip by the citywide manhunt?

12:47.541 --> 12:49.125
- Where is he?
- Right here!

12:49.208 --> 12:53.250
It is true, please,
what the babushka is saying.

12:53.333 --> 12:56.708
- What?
- Count Olaf, please, is right here.

13:00.916 --> 13:03.541
This poster is limited edition, please,

13:03.625 --> 13:07.125
and is autographed by the star
of this month's manhunt.

13:07.208 --> 13:09.875
How in the world did you manage that?

13:09.958 --> 13:14.708
Please, pretty lady, I am foreigner.
We have secret ways.

13:15.833 --> 13:16.791
Who is this man?

13:16.875 --> 13:20.125
Jerome, I told you
Gunther was coming over today,

13:20.208 --> 13:22.375
and that he might need
to hide behind the curtains.

13:22.458 --> 13:27.708
Oh, yes! It is a pleasure
to make your acquaintance.

13:28.250 --> 13:30.291
- Hello, please.
- Okay.

13:30.375 --> 13:32.916
I hope you'll forgive
the way I am talking,

13:33.000 --> 13:35.625
but I am, please, a foreigner.

13:35.708 --> 13:39.458
Very nice to meet
the husband of pretty lady Esmé

13:39.541 --> 13:41.791
and three hideous children.

13:41.875 --> 13:45.791
Is "hideous" the right word
for what it is I am trying to say?

13:47.041 --> 13:49.666
So foreign, so in.

13:49.750 --> 13:51.916
This is Olaf, and I don't mean the poster.

13:52.750 --> 13:54.250
Beautiful, no?

13:54.833 --> 13:59.291
I can see that Count Olaf is
as handsome as a noble steed

13:59.375 --> 14:02.000
riding on the back
of a beautiful princess.

14:02.083 --> 14:05.583
His legendary handsomeness is celebrated

14:05.666 --> 14:09.458
in special weekly holidays
in my faraway land, please.

14:09.541 --> 14:11.000
What faraway land is that?

14:14.833 --> 14:17.166
Far away.

14:17.250 --> 14:18.291
Oh.

14:18.375 --> 14:22.916
I don't think Count Olaf
can get very far away.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.708
Not with the law closing in.

14:24.791 --> 14:25.750
Oh.

14:25.833 --> 14:31.791
But think about the poor Quagmire twins
and their sparkly sapphires.

14:31.875 --> 14:33.416
They're not twins.

14:33.500 --> 14:37.750
If this Count Olaf is somehow recognized
and taken to jail,

14:37.833 --> 14:40.750
the little Quaggies
will never be found in their,

14:40.833 --> 14:44.083
how do you say in your language,
super-duper hiding place,

14:44.166 --> 14:46.000
and they will starve to death

14:46.083 --> 14:50.916
like castaways on desert island
or vegetarian restaurant, please.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.375
Oh!

14:52.458 --> 14:55.125
Let's not talk about depressing things
like others being kidnapped.

14:55.208 --> 14:58.041
Let's talk about exciting things
happening to me,

14:58.125 --> 15:00.208
- like the In Auction we're planning.
- Ah!

15:00.291 --> 15:02.791
The In Auction is happening
on the innest day, tomorrow,

15:02.875 --> 15:05.041
at the innest auction house, Veblen Hall,

15:05.125 --> 15:09.041
and is being hosted
by the innest auctioneer,

15:09.625 --> 15:11.791
this foreign man named Gunther.

15:11.875 --> 15:14.250
Just look, look, look, look.

15:14.833 --> 15:17.541
Just look at this glossy
but classy catalog.

15:17.625 --> 15:19.958
This auction is going to be so fashionable

15:20.041 --> 15:22.458
that people are going to have
heart attacks and hives.

15:22.541 --> 15:24.750
Of course, all the money
goes to a good cause.

15:24.833 --> 15:26.125
Aw! Which good cause?

15:26.208 --> 15:27.583
- Me. Me.
- Me. Me.

15:27.666 --> 15:30.416
Every last penny goes to me.

15:30.500 --> 15:34.250
Yes, but there will be auctioneer's fee
and incidentals, so...

15:34.333 --> 15:37.166
Shouldn't we give the proceeds
to those who need it?

15:37.250 --> 15:40.000
Perhaps those starving people
we were reading about?

15:40.083 --> 15:42.000
Starving people can't eat money.

15:42.916 --> 15:45.458
Plus, if we give money to poor people,

15:45.541 --> 15:49.208
they won't be poor, and we won't have
anyone to feel sorry for.

15:49.291 --> 15:51.000
Aw, poor people.

15:52.250 --> 15:55.500
Which reminds me,
you poor wealthy orphans,

15:55.583 --> 15:57.750
go far away, please.

15:57.833 --> 16:00.875
Esmé and I have to talk big fat business.

16:00.958 --> 16:02.416
Yes! Yes, yes, yes!

16:02.500 --> 16:06.041
Jerome, I need you to put
the children into pinstripe suits

16:06.125 --> 16:08.666
before anyone sees them in those clothes
and my life is ruined.

16:08.750 --> 16:09.750
Ah.

16:11.750 --> 16:13.625
Come this way. Okay.

16:13.708 --> 16:16.750
Ah, now, the Duchess of Winnipeg
once stayed in this very room.

16:16.833 --> 16:18.625
- No, this one.
- How many rooms are there?

16:18.708 --> 16:22.083
Seventy-one, I think.
I don't know what's in half of them.

16:22.166 --> 16:24.416
The other day I found a kitchen
I'd never seen before,

16:24.500 --> 16:26.333
and the omelet was really good.

16:27.416 --> 16:30.083
So the penthouse
has lots of places to hide.

16:30.166 --> 16:31.875
Oh, I love hide and seek!

16:31.958 --> 16:34.708
But it's so big, I thought
you'd like to bunk together tonight.

16:34.791 --> 16:37.458
Children could get lost
in this penthouse for ages.

16:38.416 --> 16:40.125
Here's your pinstripe suits.

16:41.333 --> 16:44.166
I'm going to make
another round of martinis

16:44.250 --> 16:45.916
while you three change.

16:47.458 --> 16:48.708
I am so glad you're here.

16:51.750 --> 16:53.458
I can't believe Olaf found us so quickly.

16:53.541 --> 16:55.041
That means the Quagmires are close.

16:55.125 --> 16:58.708
He said they were in arm's reach,
because the manhunt forestalled him.

17:05.125 --> 17:06.875
What if he's hiding them
in this apartment?

17:06.958 --> 17:08.875
Jerome said he doesn't know
what's in every room.

17:08.958 --> 17:11.125
And that children could stay lost
for ages.

17:11.208 --> 17:14.165
Esmé invited Gunther here.
Do you think they're working together?

17:14.250 --> 17:17.458
Esmé's already rich.
She doesn't need our fortune.

17:18.333 --> 17:21.583
Yeah, but she seems to be falling
for Count Olaf.

17:21.665 --> 17:23.958
He could marry her
and become our guardian.

17:24.040 --> 17:25.958
If something happens to Jerome.

17:27.583 --> 17:30.958
Would pretty lady Esmé und husband
like to see party trick?

17:31.041 --> 17:33.416
- Yes.
- Come, come, stand right here.

17:51.625 --> 17:52.458
No.

17:59.541 --> 18:02.958
This sofa belonged to the King of Arizona.
You don't recline on it!

18:03.041 --> 18:06.250
- Sorry, darling.
- But Gunther and the chandelier.

18:06.333 --> 18:09.708
Gunther was just showing us cane tricks
that earned him a bronze medal

18:09.791 --> 18:13.250
for his country's non-trademark-violating
version of the Olympics. Right?

18:13.333 --> 18:15.625
In my country, children do not interrupt

18:15.708 --> 18:18.541
married couple
and foreign man turning tricks.

18:18.625 --> 18:19.833
Let's forgive them this once,

18:19.916 --> 18:22.416
seeing as they've finally put on
some in suits.

18:22.500 --> 18:25.291
Where is the other one, please?

18:26.166 --> 18:27.583
My sister's exploring.

18:28.125 --> 18:31.083
She said she wants to see
every inch of this penthouse.

18:33.083 --> 18:36.791
I hope she's careful.
Without a system, a person could get lost.

18:36.875 --> 18:38.666
My sister's very resourceful.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.958
I'd like to see
the rest of the apartment...

18:57.041 --> 19:01.583
No, no, please. I do not approve
of small child browsing penthouse.

19:01.666 --> 19:02.833
It shouldn't take long.

19:02.916 --> 19:06.000
This penthouse has,
I'm guessing, two to three rooms?

19:06.875 --> 19:10.000
Two or three rooms?
Two or three rooms?

19:10.083 --> 19:11.666
Step this way, orphan boy,

19:11.750 --> 19:14.958
and prepare to be so dazzled
your eyes will turn black.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.041
I know
what your sister is up to.

19:21.125 --> 19:22.958
We know what you're up to.
You won't get away with it.

19:23.041 --> 19:25.458
Really? Have you seen my press clippings?

19:25.541 --> 19:29.958
I could get away with murder... again.

19:34.375 --> 19:36.208
This is the formal dining room.

19:36.291 --> 19:38.708
- I love these vases, don't you?
- Mmm...

19:38.791 --> 19:41.708
Sturdy enough to cause
a fatal concussion, no?

19:42.666 --> 19:44.625
This is the semiformal dining room.

19:44.708 --> 19:46.083
These vases are cute, too.

19:46.166 --> 19:49.000
Yeah, but still heavy enough
for a good whacking.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.666
The informal dining room.

19:51.750 --> 19:56.375
Tiny vase can shatter
into a million pieces and hit your eye.

20:26.166 --> 20:27.750
This is the games room.

20:46.666 --> 20:47.791
Bowling alley.

21:00.625 --> 21:02.000
My powder room.

21:02.083 --> 21:04.416
- I'm not allowed in here.
- That's right.

21:53.041 --> 21:54.666
Now, in this wing,

21:54.750 --> 22:00.125
I have a number of rooms where I display
my most expensive, most in objects.

22:01.416 --> 22:05.000
This is an enormous basket of rutabagas,
the innest root vegetable.

22:05.083 --> 22:08.583
This is a collection
of extremely long rubber bands.

22:08.666 --> 22:12.083
And this is Spain's largest handkerchief.

22:12.166 --> 22:15.875
This looks large enough for,
how do you say, suffocating rich person.

22:16.958 --> 22:20.708
- What was that?
- I said...

22:21.875 --> 22:23.958
- Oh, bless you.
- Thank you, pretty lady.

22:24.041 --> 22:26.083
I'm allergic to something in this room

22:26.166 --> 22:28.666
that is not large handkerchief
or you two adult people.

22:28.750 --> 22:29.958
The orphans, perhaps?

22:30.041 --> 22:32.416
They're orphans? Qué pasa?

22:32.500 --> 22:34.208
Yes, I'm allergic to orphans.

22:34.291 --> 22:37.833
- Is it their dust?
- Yes, yes, or their ashes.

22:37.916 --> 22:42.083
This clogs up my whole...
What is the word for it?

22:42.166 --> 22:44.166
- Glands?
- Life.

22:48.375 --> 22:50.166
Ah! We found Violet.

22:50.250 --> 22:52.416
- How was the tour?
- It was thorough.

22:52.500 --> 22:53.791
And?

22:53.875 --> 22:55.125
We're back where we started.

22:55.208 --> 22:57.708
Don't be silly.
We started in the dining room.

22:57.791 --> 23:02.208
Speaking of dining,
I am so hungry, I could chew off your arm.

23:03.125 --> 23:05.208
The innest restaurant
is half a block away.

23:05.291 --> 23:07.291
We'll take the block-long limousine
to get there.

23:07.375 --> 23:10.375
Think of the publicity.
We could get our picture in the paper.

23:10.458 --> 23:12.208
- Let's take one now.
- Yes!

23:12.291 --> 23:16.083
- I'm not sure the Baudelaires would...
- Jerome, camera. Kids, come on.

23:16.166 --> 23:19.291
Oh, no, no, pretty lady, please.
Just a money shot.

23:19.375 --> 23:22.041
Orphans in the photo
will generate excitement,

23:22.125 --> 23:25.458
like celebrities or sled dogs.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

23:25.541 --> 23:27.958
Lovely. There we go.

23:28.041 --> 23:30.958
Get the pinstripes in, Jerome.
There we go.

23:34.083 --> 23:35.416
Say cheese!

23:35.500 --> 23:36.791
Gorgonzola!

23:37.875 --> 23:40.791
"The Baudelaire orphans
are this season's fashionable accessories

23:40.875 --> 23:42.583
for the city's sixth most important
financial adviser,

23:42.666 --> 23:44.458
Esmé Gigi Geniveve Squalor, center,

23:44.541 --> 23:47.000
who is organizing the In Auction
with Gunther, far left,

23:47.083 --> 23:49.000
and her husband Jerome, not pictured."

23:49.083 --> 23:52.208
Do you have any idea
how many orphaned students from Prufrock

23:52.291 --> 23:54.458
are ending up
in the hands of dreadful people?

23:55.291 --> 23:58.583
- Surely you're not afraid of foreigners.
- What? Of course not.

23:58.666 --> 24:01.208
I am talking about the parade of tsuris
that has plagued

24:01.291 --> 24:03.541
the Baudelaires, the Quagmires,
and who knows what other orphans,

24:03.625 --> 24:06.416
whose affairs you are supposed to be
vice president of.

24:06.500 --> 24:07.750
"Tsuris" means "trouble" in Yiddish.

24:07.833 --> 24:09.666
I know what "tsuris" means.

24:09.750 --> 24:13.583
I have taken an unpaid sabbatical
from my job as a school librarian

24:13.666 --> 24:15.833
to come to the city and investigate.

24:15.916 --> 24:19.666
Frankly, the more I read,
the more confused and upset I become.

24:19.750 --> 24:21.875
The same thing happens when I read.

24:21.958 --> 24:24.041
It's why my wife and I prefer
to curl up on the sofa

24:24.125 --> 24:26.291
and watch a few episodes
of streaming television.

24:26.375 --> 24:30.333
I have discovered startling facts
and developed disturbing theories.

24:30.416 --> 24:32.041
If you have a few minutes...

24:32.125 --> 24:33.375
I'm afraid I don't.

24:33.458 --> 24:35.541
If you've ever had to postpone
a helicopter ride,

24:35.625 --> 24:37.250
you'd know how grumpy the pilots get.

24:37.333 --> 24:39.666
I don't care about grumpy pilots.

24:39.750 --> 24:42.875
The Quagmires must be found,
and Olaf must be brought to justice.

24:42.958 --> 24:45.833
Mr. Poe, please.
I haven't anywhere else to turn.

24:45.916 --> 24:50.500
That's nice. Jacquelyn, could you bring
the helicopter safety harness?

24:51.250 --> 24:52.250
Please?

25:03.708 --> 25:06.291
In a world too often governed
by corruption and arrogance,

25:06.375 --> 25:09.458
it can be difficult to stay true
to one's principles.

25:09.541 --> 25:10.500
What did you say?

25:10.583 --> 25:12.750
In a world too often governed
by corruption and arrogance...

25:12.833 --> 25:15.666
It can be difficult to stay true
to one's principles.

25:15.750 --> 25:19.125
- I've heard that a lot recently.
- There's cause to say it.

25:19.208 --> 25:20.708
- Let me call you a taxi.
- Oh...

25:20.791 --> 25:23.375
No, I can't afford a taxi
on an unpaid sabbatical.

25:23.458 --> 25:27.875
I should take the trolley back to Prufrock
and beg for my job back.

25:29.416 --> 25:30.583
The trolley!

25:32.375 --> 25:34.291
- Jacques Snicket?
- Jacquelyn Scieszka.

25:34.375 --> 25:36.250
- I need to arrange a pickup.
- What sort?

25:36.333 --> 25:39.083
There's a person armed with curiosity
and well-defined morals

25:39.166 --> 25:40.500
indicated by a concern for children

25:40.583 --> 25:43.625
who could be of benefit to the world
were she pointed in the direction

25:43.708 --> 25:46.541
of its most sinister secrets
instead of taking the trolley.

25:46.625 --> 25:48.500
Got it. Where can I find her?
What does she look like?

25:48.583 --> 25:51.333
Trolley stop, northwest kitty corner
from Mulctuary Money Management.

25:51.416 --> 25:52.750
Bright-eyed woman with a copy of

25:52.833 --> 25:55.250
The Incomplete History
of Secret Organizations.

25:55.333 --> 25:58.791
Jacquelyn, I'm having some tsuris
with my three-hole punch!

26:02.875 --> 26:03.750
Jacquelyn.

26:04.750 --> 26:08.500
All aboard for the suburbs
and other less-exciting destinations.

26:08.583 --> 26:09.833
All aboard!

26:12.375 --> 26:14.583
Not all aboard yet! Wait!

26:14.666 --> 26:17.458
If you could just wait. Please.

26:19.625 --> 26:20.833
You almost hit me!

26:21.625 --> 26:23.708
A thousand pardons.
I didn't mean to scare you.

26:23.791 --> 26:24.791
I'll never forgive myself.

26:24.875 --> 26:26.708
- Never?
- Not for a long time.

26:26.791 --> 26:29.083
- You leaving town?
- I interviewed an ice cream vendor,

26:29.166 --> 26:31.625
saw 20 minutes of a confusing movie
about zombies,

26:31.708 --> 26:33.166
and ran into a dead end at a bank.

26:33.250 --> 26:35.541
I don't know where I can go
except home... in defeat.

26:35.625 --> 26:38.083
Maybe this story's not over. Need a ride?

26:38.166 --> 26:42.708
It's my first day in the city,
but it's not my first day in the city.

26:42.791 --> 26:45.416
You can't expect me to hop into the car
of a total stranger.

26:45.500 --> 26:46.708
That is how taxis work.

26:46.791 --> 26:48.541
It's troubling to think about orphans

26:48.625 --> 26:53.208
who lost their home and parents in a fire
only to be kidnapped from Prufrock.

26:56.958 --> 26:59.000
How did you know I was searching...

26:59.083 --> 27:02.000
The taxi is just a day gig.
I'm also a member of an organization.

27:02.083 --> 27:03.458
A secret organization?

27:03.541 --> 27:05.250
If you know about it,
maybe it's not a secret.

27:07.541 --> 27:09.750
- I have been reading.
- That's usually the first step.

27:11.333 --> 27:13.708
- You're a volunteer.
- Jacques Snicket.

27:15.541 --> 27:17.416
Olivia. Olivia Caliban.

27:17.500 --> 27:19.250
Lean closer, Olivia Caliban.

27:29.166 --> 27:30.166
See better now?

27:31.208 --> 27:33.000
Depends on what you show me.

27:51.250 --> 27:54.625
Oh, dear. They're cutting down
all the trees on our street.

27:54.708 --> 27:58.458
Of course they're cutting them down.
Dark is out, light is in.

28:08.750 --> 28:10.875
Have a wonderful lunch, Mrs. Squalor.

28:10.958 --> 28:13.333
There's still a manhunt to catch Olaf.

28:13.416 --> 28:16.500
So sorry, please,
to keep you waiting, please!

28:16.583 --> 28:19.083
I was not on phone call
in phone call room.

28:23.375 --> 28:25.958
Ugh. It is so drafty in here.

28:32.416 --> 28:35.208
Oh! What the...

28:35.291 --> 28:37.791
Some help, please?
A little help?

28:37.875 --> 28:41.250
- Easy.
- Okay. I'm through.

28:41.333 --> 28:44.583
- Limousine, good afternoon.
- My name's actually Abraham.

28:46.125 --> 28:47.750
Our sources are correct.

28:47.833 --> 28:50.916
Only Olaf would feel the need
to hide under a cape.

28:54.375 --> 28:57.166
Jacquelyn, it's as we suspected.

28:57.250 --> 29:00.375
Count Olaf is hiding the Quagmires
at 667 Dark Avenue

29:00.458 --> 29:02.041
until the manhunt is over.

29:02.125 --> 29:03.958
He and the Squalors are going to lunch.

29:04.041 --> 29:05.958
We'll take it from here
if you take it from there.

29:06.583 --> 29:09.250
Who's "we"? The new recruit, that's who.

29:10.583 --> 29:12.833
Good. We need all the help we can get.

29:13.500 --> 29:16.416
My wife is here
to drive me to the helicopter pad.

29:16.500 --> 29:18.708
But, Mr. Poe, it's Secretary's Day.

29:19.416 --> 29:22.458
Are you saying I shouldn't fly
in a deathtrap

29:22.541 --> 29:25.708
but instead take you out to lunch
on solid ground?

29:25.791 --> 29:28.250
- I can be ready in five minutes.
- Me, too.

29:31.750 --> 29:36.291
Tell me, where do the city's most powerful
financial advisers lunch?

29:36.375 --> 29:40.500
Let's go someplace spiffy and schmancy.
Someplace in.

29:45.083 --> 29:48.000
Limousine, corner of Dark and Stormy.
Step on it.

29:48.083 --> 29:51.166
- I love that new coat.
- Yes, isn't it in?

29:51.250 --> 29:54.291
Imprisoned nuns made it from the feathers
of a rare species of bat.

29:54.375 --> 29:55.875
Bats don't have feathers.

29:55.958 --> 29:58.625
- Not this species.
- Not anymore.

30:22.541 --> 30:24.250
Other door! Other door!

30:29.958 --> 30:31.500
Here we are, Mrs. Squalor.

30:31.583 --> 30:34.333
- Thank you, Limousine.
- My name's actually...

30:34.416 --> 30:37.833
- You searched the entire penthouse?
- I'm sure. I had a system to keep track.

30:37.916 --> 30:41.458
- If the Quagmires are in arm's reach...
- They must be in the building.

30:46.166 --> 30:48.291
Welcome to Herring Houdini.

30:48.375 --> 30:51.333
Welcome to Herring Houdini,
a legitimate business.

30:51.416 --> 30:53.791
With no secret agenda behind it.

30:53.875 --> 30:56.375
Welcome to Herring Houdini,
home of pickled fish.

30:56.458 --> 30:58.833
- Everything has been prepared for you.
- And very quickly.

30:58.916 --> 31:01.000
But not because we got a call
five minutes ago.

31:01.083 --> 31:03.416
For the children,
we offer a tour of the kitchen.

31:03.500 --> 31:05.958
Where they will probably not be thrown
into a burlap sack.

31:06.041 --> 31:08.458
- And for the adults...
- Vodka martinis.

31:08.541 --> 31:11.916
Which don't have
any sleeping potion in them at all.

31:13.791 --> 31:15.541
We can't eat here.

31:15.625 --> 31:17.208
This sounds perfect, yes.

31:18.125 --> 31:20.833
I don't like to argue.
I'll let my wife decide.

31:21.333 --> 31:22.333
Vodka martini?

31:23.958 --> 31:25.666
Are we living in garbage?

31:32.666 --> 31:34.708
Isn't this a fine kettle of fish?

31:36.250 --> 31:39.750
Limousine, take us to a restaurant
that is actually in.

31:53.500 --> 31:54.708
There.

31:56.666 --> 32:00.250
Pretty lady, why don't you eat here
with your boring husband?

32:00.333 --> 32:03.000
I'll take the children
to the herring restaurant for kidnapping.

32:03.083 --> 32:06.250
- I mean hors d'oeuvres.
- We're not driving back there.

32:06.333 --> 32:10.541
- It is, please, important.
- You're either in or you're out.

32:10.625 --> 32:12.458
Besides, look at this place.

32:12.541 --> 32:16.125
Daily Punctilio says it's the innest thing
since that bakery on 9th Street.

32:16.208 --> 32:17.666
Sliced Bread.

32:17.750 --> 32:21.625
- Café Salmonella?
- You're going to love the theme.

32:21.708 --> 32:22.875
Mmm!

32:30.041 --> 32:31.500
Hello. I'm Larry, your waiter.

32:31.583 --> 32:34.750
Welcome to Café Salmonella,
the innest restaurant,

32:34.833 --> 32:37.541
and the only one serving
an all-salmon menu,

32:37.625 --> 32:39.833
including beverages and table linens.

32:42.666 --> 32:44.250
It's that waiter. He's everywhere we go.

32:44.333 --> 32:45.958
He's always trying to help.

32:47.750 --> 32:51.041
Larry. I, uh...

32:51.750 --> 32:53.750
I am feeling queasy, please.

32:53.833 --> 32:56.500
I need to run back
to pretty lady's apartment

32:56.583 --> 32:59.041
- where there is nothing hidden.
- Nonsense.

32:59.125 --> 33:02.083
We've had the menu translated
for our foreign guests.

33:02.166 --> 33:04.958
What language did you have it
translated into?

33:05.041 --> 33:06.291
The one you speak most fluently.

33:06.375 --> 33:09.625
Well, well, I speak all of them
hella fluently, so...

33:09.708 --> 33:13.208
- Then there's nothing to worry about.
- I... Ow.

33:15.416 --> 33:16.583
How did you...

33:20.416 --> 33:23.333
May I start you off with still
or sparkling salmon-flavored water?

33:24.208 --> 33:26.666
Salmon-flavored?

33:26.750 --> 33:29.833
You are making my mouth water
and turn pink.

33:29.916 --> 33:32.000
How do you make it salmon-flavored?

33:32.083 --> 33:33.291
We put salmon in it.

33:33.375 --> 33:35.500
- I'll have regular water.
- So would we.

33:35.583 --> 33:39.375
Nonsense! What if someone sees you?
Regular water isn't in.

33:39.458 --> 33:42.291
It's the primary ingredient
in aqueous martinis.

33:42.375 --> 33:44.625
The young people might enjoy playing along

33:44.708 --> 33:49.250
with the theme of Café Salmonella
and its virulently fishy decor.

33:53.875 --> 33:57.291
We just wish our friends could be here
enjoying it with us.

33:57.375 --> 33:58.708
That's understandable.

33:58.791 --> 34:01.791
It's quite a quagmire
to be stuck in a fashionable apartment

34:01.875 --> 34:05.875
while others are enjoying
the escape of a glamorous meal.

34:05.958 --> 34:07.583
Can you be more specific?

34:07.666 --> 34:09.416
Sit tight for a long lunch,

34:09.500 --> 34:13.416
and everything will be taken care of
by your loyal wait staff.

34:14.500 --> 34:16.541
I suggest a 46-course tasting menu

34:16.625 --> 34:19.791
designed for persons
living in a 46-story building.

34:19.875 --> 34:24.791
It is a nice, slow, leisurely meal

34:24.875 --> 34:29.583
that keeps people in their seats until
everyone has been successfully rescued.

34:32.541 --> 34:35.333
My brother once said suspicious activity
is like good jazz.

34:35.416 --> 34:37.500
We'll know it when we hear it.

34:37.583 --> 34:40.791
We have agents making sure Olaf's lunch
will take as long as possible,

34:40.875 --> 34:43.250
giving us time to search the building.

34:43.333 --> 34:44.875
All 46 stories.

34:55.333 --> 34:58.958
Even if we get past the doorperson,
46 stories is a lot of ground to cover,

34:59.041 --> 35:00.125
and a lot of stairs.

35:00.208 --> 35:03.375
- Who said we'll take the stairs?
- How long do we have?

35:03.458 --> 35:06.000
As long as it takes rich people
to eat lunch.

35:07.708 --> 35:09.416
"Rich People Have Lunch."

35:09.500 --> 35:12.583
Wait until the readers
of the Daily Punctilio see this.

35:12.666 --> 35:15.708
Esmé Squalor dining at Café Salmonella

35:15.791 --> 35:18.458
with three orphans
and a handsome foreign man.

35:18.541 --> 35:20.666
- And her husband.
- Not pictured.

35:21.166 --> 35:22.500
Je m'appelle...

35:22.583 --> 35:25.000
Ooh! Continental.

35:25.083 --> 35:29.125
Baudelaires, so happy to see you,
and in such stylish circumstances.

35:30.166 --> 35:32.875
An unemployed librarian
came into my office

35:32.958 --> 35:35.416
who had her doubts
about you living in high society.

35:35.500 --> 35:37.458
Now that I see you eating
in a stylish restaurant,

35:37.541 --> 35:39.750
I know you'll be properly cared for

35:39.833 --> 35:42.791
by the city's seventh most powerful
financial adviser.

35:42.875 --> 35:44.041
Sixth!

35:44.125 --> 35:48.833
- Sixth! Sixth most...
- Sixth. Sixth.

35:48.916 --> 35:51.500
Mr. Poe, it's important we speak with you.

35:51.583 --> 35:54.875
It's important I speak
with the lady with flashy camera.

35:54.958 --> 35:59.166
It's true that you're deciding
which restaurant is in und which is out?

35:59.250 --> 36:02.166
The Daily Punctilio
has an impeccable reputation.

36:02.250 --> 36:06.000
We predicted the outcome
of two of the last nine elections.

36:06.083 --> 36:09.625
Would you like a hot tip
on the next restaurant to be in?

36:09.708 --> 36:13.208
- From a handsome foreign man? Do tell!
- Right this way.

36:22.916 --> 36:25.041
If you're here,
who's looking for the Quagmires?

36:26.541 --> 36:28.416
An excellent question, Klaus.

36:28.500 --> 36:31.375
You remember my administrative assistant,
Jacquelyn.

36:31.458 --> 36:33.583
- Of course.
- We've seen her in a movie.

36:33.666 --> 36:34.666
And a labyrinth.

36:35.833 --> 36:37.375
And in my office.

36:37.458 --> 36:40.583
She asked for a lunch
to celebrate Secretary's Day.

36:40.666 --> 36:42.916
I was in the mood
for some vigorously fancy dining.

36:43.000 --> 36:46.750
So we can all sit back and relax,

36:46.833 --> 36:49.250
because everything is going
according to plan.

36:52.125 --> 36:53.291
Plan?

36:53.958 --> 36:56.041
- Suction cups.
- Suction cups.

36:56.125 --> 36:57.041
Non-slippery shoes.

36:57.750 --> 36:58.875
Non-slippery shoes.

36:58.958 --> 37:00.250
Safety rope.

37:00.916 --> 37:03.833
- I have a question about the rope.
- It attaches to your waist.

37:03.916 --> 37:06.458
Then what does it attach to?
The building? The fire escape?

37:09.750 --> 37:10.750
Me.

37:10.833 --> 37:13.541
So, Jacques Snicket, we go down together.

37:13.625 --> 37:16.041
No, Olivia Caliban, we go up together.

37:24.541 --> 37:28.666
I'm back! Oh! Did I miss the entire lunch?

37:28.750 --> 37:30.666
You didn't even miss the first course,

37:30.750 --> 37:33.750
which is creamy salmon soup
with a hint of salmon

37:33.833 --> 37:36.041
and the eye of a salmon
hidden in the bottom.

37:38.208 --> 37:40.000
Keep your eyes peeled.

37:40.083 --> 37:42.916
I hope we find the Quagmires soon
and that these ropes are sturdy.

37:47.708 --> 37:50.500
The next course is salmon sabayon,

37:50.583 --> 37:54.041
which I'll pour very slowly
from this little pitcher

37:54.125 --> 37:56.375
that looks like a salmon throwing up.

38:20.750 --> 38:23.583
We're just gonna sorta dance
this around a little bit.

38:28.208 --> 38:30.666
Salmon bread
served with salmon butter

38:30.750 --> 38:33.416
distilled from the head
of a freshly caught salmon.

38:34.291 --> 38:36.458
What am I tasting here?

38:36.541 --> 38:37.708
Rutabaga.

38:46.333 --> 38:50.833
The life cycle of the salmon is not unlike
the life cycle of human beings,

38:50.916 --> 38:53.333
in that it begins in cozy circumstances,

38:53.416 --> 38:57.791
gets progressively colder,
and often ends in suffering and tragedy.

38:57.875 --> 39:00.791
Now this salmon here was burned alive.

39:05.250 --> 39:08.166
One of the most difficult aspects
of a salmon's life cycle

39:08.250 --> 39:11.750
is when they swim upstream to spawn,
a word which here means

39:11.833 --> 39:14.500
"spend quality time
with the salmon they love most."

39:14.583 --> 39:17.291
Swimming upstream
is a difficult thing to do,

39:17.375 --> 39:19.833
because you are swimming
against the current.

39:19.916 --> 39:23.750
The Baudelaires felt as if they were
swimming upstream at Café Salmonella,

39:23.833 --> 39:26.875
and not just because they were surrounded
by so much salmon.

39:26.958 --> 39:28.291
- Gravlax!
- Gravlax?

39:28.375 --> 39:29.500
- Salmon.
- Ah.

39:29.583 --> 39:31.875
They were swimming against the current

39:31.958 --> 39:35.958
of everyone believing Olaf was
a foreign man named Gunther.

39:36.041 --> 39:39.000
Gunther, your culture is so interesting.

39:39.083 --> 39:43.250
Not like other countries that make me
feel guilty and uncomfortable.

39:43.333 --> 39:46.208
Jerome, have you noticed
anything about Gunther?

39:46.916 --> 39:48.833
He has a bit of an accent.

39:48.916 --> 39:53.583
- Something more suspicious than an accent.
- Baudelaires, I'm surprised at you.

39:53.666 --> 39:55.333
Do you know what "xenophobia" means?

39:55.416 --> 39:59.500
Phobia means "the fear of,"
like podophobia means "the fear of feet."

39:59.583 --> 40:02.583
Yes, but xenophobia
is the fear of strangers

40:02.666 --> 40:07.125
because they come from different places
or happen to eat different foods...

40:07.208 --> 40:09.041
Salmon tail salad

40:09.125 --> 40:12.208
- with some salmon skin croutons.
- Lovely.

40:12.291 --> 40:13.750
- Ooh!
- Ooh.

40:13.833 --> 40:16.666
I never expected you children
to be xenophobic.

40:16.750 --> 40:18.833
Your parents weren't afraid of anything.

40:18.916 --> 40:22.458
You should've seen your mother
when she fought that eagle.

40:22.541 --> 40:24.333
She was a remarkable woman.

40:24.416 --> 40:26.708
I just wish that I'd listened to her more.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.250
Why did you lose touch?

40:28.333 --> 40:31.666
- There's many factors...
- Make way for an important reporter.

40:31.750 --> 40:35.833
I just phoned in a hot scoop
that will really elevate our readership.

40:36.583 --> 40:40.416
Elevate our... Elevate our...

40:40.500 --> 40:45.000
Elevator... Elevator...
Elevate our readership.

40:45.083 --> 40:46.208
What did you say?

40:46.291 --> 40:49.000
I said,
"Important reporter coming through."

40:49.958 --> 40:50.833
You're thinking.

40:50.916 --> 40:53.208
It could be nothing,
but it could be everything.

40:53.791 --> 40:56.291
Can we get back to 667 Dark Avenue?

40:56.375 --> 41:00.291
Not until you get through
the entire life cycle of the salmon.

41:00.375 --> 41:02.291
This is, how do I say,

41:02.375 --> 41:06.458
the end, il finito, el end de lunch
de salmono, please. Please!

41:06.541 --> 41:10.375
Please, sir. There are more floors,
I mean courses, to go.

41:10.458 --> 41:11.625
We can't leave now.

41:11.708 --> 41:14.833
Eating too much food for too much money
is the essence of civilization.

41:14.916 --> 41:16.666
Nothing would make me leave this place!

41:19.291 --> 41:23.125
Café Salmonella is out!
Herring Houdini is in!

41:26.000 --> 41:27.125
Finally!

41:27.208 --> 41:30.625
I'm putting the orphans in doggy bag
to take home.

41:30.708 --> 41:33.000
What are you talking about?
It's time to eat!

41:33.083 --> 41:35.875
- After a meal like that...
- Hurry, hurry, hurry.

41:35.958 --> 41:39.708
Before anyone else sees us eating in this
hole-in-the-wall! This place is so out!

41:39.791 --> 41:41.000
This is our chance.

41:41.875 --> 41:43.541
Jerome, that place is fishy.

41:43.625 --> 41:45.625
Don't eat or drink anything they give you.

41:45.708 --> 41:48.708
I never want to eat
or drink anything fishy again.

41:55.125 --> 41:57.916
- It's no use!
- We're swimming upstream!

42:04.791 --> 42:06.208
Where...

42:18.958 --> 42:22.416
Donner, party of five? Donner?

42:22.500 --> 42:25.250
You did it again, Eleanora.
Look at this crowd.

42:25.333 --> 42:27.958
Every journalist knows
when a foreign man gives you a tip,

42:28.041 --> 42:29.833
you should believe him without question.

42:29.916 --> 42:33.500
- Right this way, rich people!
- Oh!

42:33.583 --> 42:36.208
You're certain there's no herring in this?

42:36.291 --> 42:38.083
- I promise.
- Oh, thank God.

42:41.500 --> 42:43.416
This isn't working.
You need to shut this place down.

42:43.500 --> 42:44.958
Are you kidding?
We're booked through February.

42:45.041 --> 42:47.458
Never mind that! Where are the orphans?

42:51.208 --> 42:52.208
Ow! God!

42:59.250 --> 43:01.666
We've searched 45 floors.
No sign of the Quagmires.

43:01.750 --> 43:03.500
Let's hope we get lucky in the penthouse.

43:10.583 --> 43:13.625
What Mrs. Poe said about elevators
got me thinking.

43:14.541 --> 43:17.708
On every other floor there is
one elevator, but here there's two.

43:17.791 --> 43:19.791
There has to be an explanation.

43:19.875 --> 43:22.541
Maybe it's where Count Olaf
hid the Quagmires.

43:39.458 --> 43:44.041
No platform, no console, no cables
or electromagnetic braking system.

43:44.125 --> 43:46.250
- There's no elevator at all.
- The elevator's ersatz.

43:47.875 --> 43:50.541
- It's just a long dark tunnel.
- A shaft.

43:52.250 --> 43:54.375
The Quagmires got kidnapped
while trying to help us.

43:54.458 --> 43:55.791
- It's our fault they're gone.
- It's not.

43:55.875 --> 43:58.625
- It is if we don't rescue them.
- We will.

44:15.333 --> 44:18.166
Mmm! Mmm-mmm-mmm.

44:20.708 --> 44:25.583
This food is so much better than all that
other delicious food at that other place.

44:27.250 --> 44:28.583
Excuse me.

44:29.666 --> 44:30.958
They disappeared.

44:31.041 --> 44:34.125
We've managed to lure everyone else
except for the orphans.

44:35.708 --> 44:37.458
We'll skip dessert, please.

44:37.541 --> 44:39.750
Yes. Yes, this food is so in,

44:39.833 --> 44:42.541
it's actually hard to be in my mouth.

44:43.333 --> 44:45.041
What do you think, Jerome?

44:45.125 --> 44:48.958
I'm sorry. I'm feeling so sleepy.
It must be something I drank.

44:49.041 --> 44:52.291
You can sleep it off on way home.
Hurry to penthouse

44:52.375 --> 44:54.833
to make sure nothing has been stolen
during the afternoon.

44:56.000 --> 44:57.666
You're not going anywhere...

45:00.125 --> 45:03.875
until you entertain us with a song.

45:05.250 --> 45:06.333
What?

45:06.416 --> 45:08.083
Didn't that man work at the other place?

45:08.166 --> 45:12.000
My sources have learned
you're quite the chanteuse.

45:12.083 --> 45:15.541
No, that's the lighting.
My skin is regular foreign color.

45:15.625 --> 45:17.125
He's being modest.

45:17.208 --> 45:19.791
Gunther's songbird skills have earned him

45:19.875 --> 45:23.625
more or less favorable reviews
in one small magazine.

45:23.708 --> 45:26.000
No, no.
You must be thinking of other foreign man.

45:26.083 --> 45:30.041
Why, you'd have to launch
a citywide manhunt

45:30.125 --> 45:32.500
to catch a singer this good.

45:32.750 --> 45:37.333
Won't you please grace the crowd
at this in restaurant with a little song?

45:37.416 --> 45:40.041
I know the readers of the Daily Punctilio

45:40.125 --> 45:44.458
would love to hear about a man from
a foreign country singing in a restaurant.

45:44.541 --> 45:46.666
Mmm, mmm, mmm! Publicity.

45:47.250 --> 45:50.041
Some music will help me
digest my fish heads.

45:51.333 --> 45:55.750
No! No! No! Absolutely... What's the word?
Never as long as I live.

45:55.833 --> 45:57.000
Pretty please?

45:58.041 --> 45:59.250
For Secretary's Day?

45:59.333 --> 46:02.083
For Secretary's Day!

46:02.166 --> 46:05.291
For Secretary's Day! For Secretary's Day!

46:05.375 --> 46:08.291
For Secretary's Day!
For Secretary's Day!

46:08.375 --> 46:10.333
For Secretary's Day!

46:10.416 --> 46:13.291
For Secretary's Day! For Secretary's Day!

46:13.375 --> 46:16.458
- For Secretary's Day!
- For Secretary's Day!

46:17.625 --> 46:20.333
If you insist.

46:31.000 --> 46:34.166
Mind the tempo on the bridge
and watch me for the key changes.

48:31.708 --> 48:33.833
Let's hear it for the band!

49:08.458 --> 49:09.291
Ow.

49:14.208 --> 49:15.291
You nervous?

49:15.916 --> 49:19.041
I'm anxious.
I'm not sure if I'm ready to do this.

49:19.833 --> 49:20.708
Me neither.

49:20.791 --> 49:23.583
If we wait until we're ready,
we'll wait the rest of our lives.

49:36.375 --> 49:37.958
- Duncan!
- Isadora!
