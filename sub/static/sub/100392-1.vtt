03:36.784 --> 03:38.617
Your workout routine's gonna kill me.

03:38.619 --> 03:39.885
Huh.

03:41.255 --> 03:43.288
You are my workout routine.

03:44.658 --> 03:46.458
[Alex] You're not leavin' already, are you?

03:46.460 --> 03:49.928
I do not wanna be here when your daughter gets home from school.

04:25.499 --> 04:27.733
Is my daughter upstairs?

04:38.312 --> 04:40.412
Goddammit, Nicole.

04:45.452 --> 04:48.553
[birds chirping]

04:54.328 --> 04:56.428
[Chloe] So, did you use protection?

05:03.637 --> 05:05.771
I mean, if you can't even talk about it,

05:05.773 --> 05:08.640
maybe you're not ready for sex.

05:14.548 --> 05:17.849
Hey... I'm not making any judgments.

05:17.851 --> 05:19.351
I just don't wanna see you make

05:19.353 --> 05:21.420
the same mistakes that I did when...

05:22.890 --> 05:24.056
You can't wait until after dinner

05:24.058 --> 05:26.091
to remind me I was a mistake?

05:26.093 --> 05:30.595
[chuckles] That is not what I said!

05:30.597 --> 05:31.997
Yeah, that's not the best choice of words.

05:31.999 --> 05:34.733
-I don't think. -No kidding.

05:34.735 --> 05:37.069
Well, I mean, you can't give her ammunition like that.

05:37.071 --> 05:39.037
[sighs] Well, Alex,

05:39.039 --> 05:42.074
she turns everything I say into ammunition.

05:42.076 --> 05:46.345
I bet she's in there right now trash-talking me to Shay.

05:46.347 --> 05:48.513
Trash-texting.

05:48.515 --> 05:51.016
Yeah, Shay's the same way with her mom.

05:52.619 --> 05:54.653
She just pushes me away.

05:54.655 --> 05:57.923
You know, I think you could be talkin' about us.

05:57.925 --> 06:00.726
I mean, you push me away.

06:00.728 --> 06:03.829
Don't you think this is nice, you know, the two of us in bed?

06:03.831 --> 06:06.131
Talking about how our day went.

06:07.668 --> 06:09.935
We should try it in person sometime.

06:09.937 --> 06:12.471
I should probably go check on her.

06:12.473 --> 06:14.506
[Alex on phone] Hey, Chloe...

06:14.508 --> 06:17.709
I like you. Okay?

06:17.711 --> 06:20.946
And more than w-whatever this is.

06:22.483 --> 06:24.082
Goodnight, Alex.

06:25.886 --> 06:28.987

[Chloe sighs]

07:01.054 --> 07:04.089
[music continues]

07:25.012 --> 07:27.112

07:50.871 --> 07:53.138
Like, where did she get that...

07:53.140 --> 07:54.840
[girls giggling]

07:54.842 --> 07:57.843
[sighs] I think my mom is straight up ignoring me now.

07:57.845 --> 08:00.045
I wish my mom would ignore me.

08:01.915 --> 08:03.882
And the boots.

08:04.852 --> 08:07.919
[indistinct chatter]

08:13.861 --> 08:16.895
Stella, Charlotte and I have a question for you.

08:20.801 --> 08:22.801
[screams]

08:22.803 --> 08:24.236
Damn, Nicole, what'd she do?

08:24.238 --> 08:27.506
[Serena sobbing]

08:29.910 --> 08:32.077
[Serena] Why?

08:32.880 --> 08:34.913
[telephone ringing]

08:36.984 --> 08:39.985
Hello? Yes, this is Chloe.

08:42.890 --> 08:44.289
Thank you.

08:47.861 --> 08:50.929

[swing squeaking]

09:01.875 --> 09:04.943
[indistinct chatter]

09:10.584 --> 09:12.217
Aunt Sadie!

09:12.219 --> 09:15.020
Nicky!

09:15.022 --> 09:16.621
-Hi! -Hi!

09:16.623 --> 09:19.991
[laughs] Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

09:19.993 --> 09:22.160
-Oh! What are you doing here? -Oh, my God.

09:22.162 --> 09:25.263
I had to come see my favorite little niece.

09:25.265 --> 09:28.333
-I'm your only niece. -Ooh, that's right.

09:28.335 --> 09:31.036
-Ooh. -Ooh. Oh, you're so gorgeous.

09:31.038 --> 09:33.905
-[Sadie] Don't you know? -Sadie.

09:33.907 --> 09:38.109
Hi, Chloe. Come on, don't be sad.

09:38.111 --> 09:40.011
I should be incredibly mad at you.

09:40.013 --> 09:42.180
One whole year and nothing?

09:42.182 --> 09:45.050
[Sadie] Uh, yeah, but I'm sorry.

09:45.052 --> 09:46.585
[Chloe] Mm... [Sadie] Ping, ping, ping, ping.

09:46.587 --> 09:49.955
-Well, I'm not even mad. -Yeah, don't be.

09:49.957 --> 09:53.325
Hi! Hi!

09:53.327 --> 09:56.728
[Nicole] Look. [Sadie] Wow! Ha-ha-ha!

09:56.730 --> 09:58.229
[Nicole laughs]

09:58.231 --> 10:01.666
[Sadie] Oh, my God! [Nicole] Heh-heh.

10:01.668 --> 10:04.035
[Chloe] So what do you think? Does the house feel smaller?

10:04.037 --> 10:07.839
[Sadie] No, it's the same. I mean, it feels kind of big.

10:07.841 --> 10:09.908
[Nicole grunts]

10:09.910 --> 10:11.910
-Oh, wait, here. -No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no.

10:11.912 --> 10:13.311
-I've got it. -Okay. Um...

10:13.313 --> 10:16.047
-Are you in my old room still? -[chuckles]

10:16.049 --> 10:17.716
-Yeah, best room in the house. -Okay.

10:17.718 --> 10:19.317
Well, will you put my stuff in there, then?

10:19.319 --> 10:22.053
-[Nicole] Yes, master. -We have a spare room.

10:22.055 --> 10:25.190
-Don't you want your own space? -No! I wanna be with Nicky.

10:25.192 --> 10:28.259
[gasps] Oh, yay!

10:28.261 --> 10:31.329
[instrumental music]

10:35.035 --> 10:37.936
I am home.

10:37.938 --> 10:40.772
Oh, it's been a long time since I've been able to say that.

10:44.211 --> 10:45.777
I really love your hair, by the way.

10:45.779 --> 10:48.013
-Really? -Yeah.

10:48.015 --> 10:50.081
You haven't grown it out since you were little.

10:52.019 --> 10:54.085
I'm glad you like it.

10:57.090 --> 10:59.257
Where were you?

10:59.259 --> 11:03.862
I think the last I heard was, um... New Orleans?

11:05.932 --> 11:08.967
Yeah. Doesn't really matter.

11:10.404 --> 11:12.837
It matters to me.

11:12.839 --> 11:14.806
[footsteps approaching]

11:14.808 --> 11:17.742
How long are you here for?

11:17.744 --> 11:20.378
I don't know. How long will you have me?

11:20.380 --> 11:23.014
Well, for as long as you'd like.

11:23.016 --> 11:26.217
I mean, it's still your home, too.

11:26.219 --> 11:30.121
-[Nicole] Move in! Move in! -Okay.

11:30.123 --> 11:32.090
I mean, I don't have anywhere I've gotta go.

11:32.092 --> 11:35.126
So I guess we could just take it, like, one day at a time,

11:35.128 --> 11:36.761
if that works for you.

11:38.198 --> 11:39.864
You'd probably be sick of me by tomorrow.

11:39.866 --> 11:40.899
-No way. -Really?

11:40.901 --> 11:42.233
'Cause I'll keep doin' this.

11:42.235 --> 11:43.968
I would love it.

11:43.970 --> 11:45.236
[crickets chirping]

11:45.238 --> 11:47.172
[Nicole] Well, why did you leave us?

11:47.174 --> 11:50.141
I, um...

11:50.143 --> 11:52.444
Well, you know, your mom had been

11:52.446 --> 11:55.146
basically looking after me since she was 15.

11:55.148 --> 11:58.483
-No, that's, that's not-- -No, it is true. Totally true.

11:58.485 --> 12:01.753
'Cause after my mom and our dad died,

12:01.755 --> 12:03.988
Aunt Betty moved in.

12:03.990 --> 12:06.257
And she just... She sucked.

12:06.259 --> 12:08.827
She just, like, drank G and Ts

12:08.829 --> 12:11.796
and watched Bold And The Beautiful all day, every day.

12:11.798 --> 12:15.500
So your mom was basically all I had.

12:15.502 --> 12:18.002
And then she had you when she was a baby.

12:18.004 --> 12:20.405
That was, that was great and fine and--

12:20.407 --> 12:23.875
-So it was my fault you left. -No! It wasn't... It's not.

12:23.877 --> 12:26.177
Not... That's not true. Um, that's not what I meant.

12:26.179 --> 12:27.779
I just like...

12:28.315 --> 12:30.782
It was just...

12:30.784 --> 12:35.053
I had more energy than this town could handle.

12:37.891 --> 12:41.793
So what did this girl do, the one that you hit?

12:41.795 --> 12:43.194
[chuckles softly]

12:43.196 --> 12:45.964
-Bitch was about to talk shit. -Hey--

12:45.966 --> 12:49.934
Wait, she was about to talk shit. So she hadn't?

12:49.936 --> 12:52.103
Oh, so you're just nippin' it in the bud, are you?

12:52.105 --> 12:53.371
-Mm-hmm. -[Chloe] Be careful.

12:53.373 --> 12:56.508
-This one's impulsive. -Oh-oh.

12:56.510 --> 12:59.310
Like me.

12:59.312 --> 13:02.547
I always said Nicky and I are kindred spirits.

13:04.451 --> 13:06.518
[crickets chirping]

13:08.088 --> 13:11.156
[instrumental music]

13:14.060 --> 13:16.094
[Nicole] I know I should have outgrown this thing by now,

13:16.096 --> 13:18.496
but I just...

13:18.498 --> 13:21.065
I just love it.

13:21.067 --> 13:23.434
I think we'd all be better off if we never outgrew the things

13:23.436 --> 13:25.336
we loved as kids.

13:28.208 --> 13:30.508
It's so funny that you still have that.

13:30.510 --> 13:33.211
I'd be roadkill if it wasn't for you.

13:34.181 --> 13:37.048
I owe you my life, Aunt Sadie.

13:37.050 --> 13:39.384
Mm, you owe your life to your mom.

13:39.386 --> 13:43.521
Mm, yeah. She reminds me of it every day.

13:43.523 --> 13:45.990
Your mom is the strongest person I know.

13:45.992 --> 13:47.192
You'd be surprised what can happen

13:47.194 --> 13:49.093
if you just open up to her.

13:49.095 --> 13:52.831
-She doesn't give me a chance. -What do you mean?

13:55.836 --> 13:58.570
-I sort of have a boyfriend now. -Whoo-hoo!

13:58.572 --> 14:02.273
[laughs] Nicky... Wait, what's his name?

14:02.275 --> 14:06.411
-His name is Derek. -Derek.

14:06.413 --> 14:10.048
Derek and Nicole. Nicole and Derek.

14:10.050 --> 14:11.916
I love it. What else?

14:11.918 --> 14:16.554
He is cute and...

14:18.091 --> 14:20.491
I don't know, he likes video games.

14:20.493 --> 14:24.362
-He sounds perfect. So... -[chuckles]

14:24.364 --> 14:27.398
He's better than that. I don't know.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.400
The other day...

14:30.937 --> 14:34.639
mom walked in on us and our shirts were off.

14:34.641 --> 14:37.208
[gasps] Nicky!

14:37.210 --> 14:39.444
-Are you sleeping with him? -No! No, no, no.

14:39.446 --> 14:41.946
No, no, no. We were just messing around.

14:41.948 --> 14:45.450
But, see, at least you ask,

14:45.452 --> 14:47.919
instead of just assuming.

14:47.921 --> 14:50.121
Have you slept with anyone?

14:51.324 --> 14:53.958
No! That's a good thing.

14:53.960 --> 14:56.594
Teenage boys have a lot to learn.

14:56.596 --> 14:59.297
It's really nice to be able to talk to you about this stuff.

14:59.299 --> 15:03.101
With my mom, it's just so weird.

15:03.103 --> 15:06.504
"Nicole, are you using protection?"

15:06.506 --> 15:09.007
Yeah, well, imagine if you had a baby right now.

15:09.009 --> 15:11.476
Yeah. No, thank you.

15:11.478 --> 15:14.679
She had to raise you all on her own.

15:14.681 --> 15:18.683
She's had to do everything on her own. So, I don't know.

15:18.685 --> 15:20.652
I guess it seems like she's kinda hard on you,

15:20.654 --> 15:23.521
but you can always talk to her.

15:24.491 --> 15:25.957
Always.

15:31.031 --> 15:33.364
Mm, whoo.

15:33.366 --> 15:35.300
[chuckles] I like that haircut of you, though.

15:35.302 --> 15:37.702
-[chuckles] -[Sadie] It looks great.

15:37.704 --> 15:39.537
You're not mad at me for copying you?

15:39.539 --> 15:41.940
I mean, you didn't really copy me.

15:41.942 --> 15:44.342
Uh, yes, I did.

15:46.012 --> 15:49.080
[instrumental music]

15:51.084 --> 15:52.984
Ugh!

15:52.986 --> 15:55.687
-[chuckles] You look pretty. -That is...

15:55.689 --> 15:59.324
-Yeah. -Mom says I kinda look like you.

16:01.094 --> 16:03.194
Yeah, sure!

16:17.344 --> 16:20.411
[eerie music]

16:24.250 --> 16:27.318
[Young Nicole laughing]

16:31.224 --> 16:34.092
[Young Nicole] I owe you my life, Aunt Sadie.

16:47.140 --> 16:49.407
-Good morning. -Good morning.

16:49.409 --> 16:52.477
[cutlery clattering]

17:00.086 --> 17:03.021
-Hey, Sadie. -Mm?

17:04.391 --> 17:06.590
-Can-can we talk for a minute? -Yeah.

17:15.367 --> 17:19.569
-Is everything okay? -What do you mean?

17:19.571 --> 17:24.075
Oh, well, I mean, you showed up out of the blue...

17:24.077 --> 17:27.712
which, don't get me wrong, I'm grateful for.

17:28.515 --> 17:30.581
I'm thrilled to see you.

17:34.354 --> 17:37.388
But if it's because...

17:37.390 --> 17:39.424
you need help with something

17:39.426 --> 17:42.593
or somebody or anything...

17:45.598 --> 17:47.598
you need to tell me.

17:52.505 --> 17:54.172
-Sadie. -Yeah.

17:54.174 --> 17:56.407
No, sorry, I'm just, uh...

17:58.311 --> 18:00.645
I, um ...

18:03.683 --> 18:07.285
I wanted to come home 'cause like...

18:08.521 --> 18:10.655
I've kind of...

18:14.861 --> 18:17.595
you know, made a mess of a lot of things

18:17.597 --> 18:21.499
and... I've, like, failed in literally everything

18:21.501 --> 18:25.303
I've tried to do, so, I, uh...

18:28.274 --> 18:30.241
I don't have many options.

18:30.243 --> 18:32.376
I just thought that I should, you know, come home

18:32.378 --> 18:36.414
and... um, maybe start over?

18:36.416 --> 18:39.784
It's, which is probably stupid.

18:39.786 --> 18:43.254
No. It doesn't sound stupid to me at all.

18:46.392 --> 18:48.593
Hey, look, I-I don't, I don't know

18:48.595 --> 18:50.728
what you've been going through, but...

18:52.565 --> 18:54.565
I know that you're still young

18:54.567 --> 18:56.667
and, I think,

18:56.669 --> 18:59.704
maybe you're being too hard on yourself.

18:59.706 --> 19:01.272
And I think it makes perfect sense

19:01.274 --> 19:04.408
to take a moment, regroup, rebuild.

19:05.778 --> 19:08.546
And in the meantime, you're home. Right?

19:08.548 --> 19:10.281
Mm-hmm.

19:11.584 --> 19:14.752
Come here. No more sad face. Give me a hug.

19:17.157 --> 19:20.224
[Chloe humming]

19:27.634 --> 19:29.700
[Nicole] What's going on in here?

19:29.702 --> 19:31.502
[Sadie] Nothing.

19:33.206 --> 19:35.439
I was just getting ready for work.

19:35.441 --> 19:36.741
Mm-hmm.

19:38.411 --> 19:40.178
Oh, and, Sadie,

19:40.180 --> 19:42.747
I'm not exactly thrilled with the idea

19:42.749 --> 19:46.751
of Nicole having too much fun as she's suspended.

19:46.753 --> 19:50.888
Oh, okay. Should we make her scrub the floors, then?

19:50.890 --> 19:53.758
You know, that might teach her a lesson.

19:55.662 --> 19:58.829
But I know she hasn't seen her Aunt Sadie in a long time, so...

19:58.831 --> 20:01.933
And that girl was gonna talk shit.

20:01.935 --> 20:04.202
-That is true. -All right.

20:04.204 --> 20:07.838
Let's not go there now, but I suppose

20:07.840 --> 20:11.475
I can postpone the punishment for now.

20:11.477 --> 20:13.578
-Thank you! -Aw...

20:13.580 --> 20:15.346
-All right, have fun. -Yup.

20:15.348 --> 20:16.914
Still be good, but don't have too much fun.

20:16.916 --> 20:20.351
Nope. Never when you're not here.

20:20.353 --> 20:22.553
[Russian accent] Eh, so what should we do first

20:22.555 --> 20:24.255
as good girls?

20:24.257 --> 20:26.757
[Russian accent] We do, uh... garage?

20:26.759 --> 20:29.927
-[gasps] Okay, you weirdo. -Okay.

20:29.929 --> 20:31.996
[Sadie chuckles]

20:35.702 --> 20:37.835
-Okay. -Yeah?

20:40.240 --> 20:43.808
¶ Ta ta-da-da ¶

20:43.810 --> 20:46.544
Oh, my... Hey, did...

20:46.546 --> 20:49.614
-I smashed this to pieces! -I know.

20:49.616 --> 20:52.383
One of your famous temper tantrums.

20:52.385 --> 20:56.654
Mom told me all about it. I get them, too.

20:56.656 --> 21:00.024
It took me forever to put it back together.

21:00.026 --> 21:02.860
-Look. -Yeah, it's the Edwards family.

21:02.862 --> 21:04.695
-I made these guys. -[chuckles]

21:04.697 --> 21:06.397
I used to play with them all the time.

21:06.399 --> 21:08.032
-Wait, you did? -[Nicole] Yeah.

21:08.034 --> 21:12.870
I also, uh, have that book that you wrote about them.

21:15.541 --> 21:17.875
-You're such a good writer. -Mm-hmm.

21:17.877 --> 21:21.279
Shay and I added a few of our own, but they probably suck.

21:21.281 --> 21:22.546
[Sadie chuckles]

21:24.017 --> 21:26.684
[instrumental music]

21:27.920 --> 21:30.521
We used to get dressed up

21:30.523 --> 21:33.291
and pretend we were the Edward sisters.

21:33.293 --> 21:36.360
[indistinct whispering]

21:37.430 --> 21:40.431
[Sadie] So nobody understood...

21:42.969 --> 21:44.769
Nobody understood.

21:44.771 --> 21:47.972
Are you... mad?

21:47.974 --> 21:50.041
No.

21:50.043 --> 21:52.710
[chuckles] Kinda seems like you're mad.

21:52.712 --> 21:56.480
No, I'm really not. It's just a lot of nostalgia.

21:56.482 --> 21:59.617
Haven't looked at this stuff in ages.

21:59.619 --> 22:03.087
Hey, are nana's old theater costumes down here still?

22:03.089 --> 22:04.322
Mm-hmm.

22:04.324 --> 22:07.391
[instrumental music]

22:21.574 --> 22:25.343
[laughing] Come and get me!

22:26.946 --> 22:30.014
[intense music]

22:30.683 --> 22:32.583
[giggling]

22:32.585 --> 22:36.654
[singsong] Good day! My lady.

22:37.590 --> 22:40.057
[engines revving]

22:40.893 --> 22:42.760
Kill her...

22:44.464 --> 22:45.830
Sadie?

22:47.767 --> 22:49.600
What's wrong?

22:49.602 --> 22:52.103
Come on, we should go.

22:52.105 --> 22:53.971
We don't wanna get caught playin' hooky.

22:53.973 --> 22:56.040
Mom won't like that.

23:00.413 --> 23:02.880
Bet you can't catch me! Ha-ha!

23:02.882 --> 23:05.116
-Yes, I can! -Bet you can't!

23:05.118 --> 23:07.785
[instrumental music]

23:08.955 --> 23:11.989
-[Sadie] Ah! -[Nicole chuckles]

23:21.501 --> 23:24.001
-[Sadie screaming] -[Nicole screaming]

23:24.003 --> 23:26.570
Ooh!

23:26.572 --> 23:30.474
-How did you do that? -I'm very, very, well, smart.

23:30.476 --> 23:33.411
[indistinct chatter]

23:42.088 --> 23:43.621
[car lock beeps]

23:45.892 --> 23:49.193
[Shay] Thanks. See you. [Alex] Okay. See you.

23:49.195 --> 23:52.430
-Well, hello, Shay. -Hey, Chloe.

23:52.432 --> 23:55.132
Did my dear darling daughter ask you over?

23:55.134 --> 23:57.902
-Yeah. -Is that okay?

23:57.904 --> 23:59.904
-Hello, Alex. How are you? -Hello, Chloe.

23:59.906 --> 24:01.705
It's nice to see you again.

24:01.707 --> 24:05.709
Did Shay here tell you that Nicole was suspended yesterday?

24:05.711 --> 24:07.578
[chuckles] Uh, no.

24:07.580 --> 24:08.746
-She didn't mention that. -[Nicole and Sadie screaming]

24:08.748 --> 24:11.449
-Mm... -Come real quick.

24:11.451 --> 24:13.484
Sounds like you're not supposed to be here, sweetie.

24:13.486 --> 24:16.220
-Dad. -No, actually, it's okay.

24:16.222 --> 24:18.823
Sadie is back in town, and, uh,

24:18.825 --> 24:20.758
well, I might've postponed the punishment.

24:20.760 --> 24:22.693
So go ahead. You're good.

24:24.864 --> 24:26.230
-Sadie, huh? -Yeah.

24:26.232 --> 24:28.766
-Blast from the past. -You're telling me.

24:28.768 --> 24:30.734
Shay mentioned that there might be a party tonight.

24:30.736 --> 24:35.072
I was thinkin' if the kids went, we could, um, get together.

24:37.577 --> 24:39.643
Well, if they go,

24:39.645 --> 24:41.645
I'll probably just be hangin' out with my sister.

24:41.647 --> 24:44.014
-Okay. -But I'll catch you next time.

24:44.016 --> 24:45.483
Okay.

24:47.820 --> 24:49.520
[Shay] Hey, what are you guys doing?

24:49.522 --> 24:50.955
[Nicole] Hey, Sadie, what should Shay be?

24:50.957 --> 24:52.623
-Hey. -I can't believe you're here.

24:52.625 --> 24:56.260
Mm-hmm. Hey, look at you. You're all grown up.

24:56.262 --> 24:57.928
How's your family?

24:57.930 --> 24:59.663
-Remember my brother, Rory? -Mm-hmm.

24:59.665 --> 25:00.931
He's pre-med at Columbia.

25:00.933 --> 25:02.733
-Oh, wow! -Go, Rory.

25:02.735 --> 25:04.502
-Pretty, yeah. -Nice.

25:04.504 --> 25:07.571
-What about your parents? -Oh, uh...

25:07.573 --> 25:10.140
They're separated. Her mom kinda bailed.

25:10.142 --> 25:12.209
Oh, no. I'm so sorry.

25:12.211 --> 25:14.044
-They'll get back together. -Mm.

25:14.046 --> 25:15.713
They're a total mess without each other.

25:15.715 --> 25:17.882
Yeah, I'm-I'm sure that's what's gonna happen.

25:17.884 --> 25:19.884
But Nicole's right, we have to get you changed.

25:19.886 --> 25:22.553
-You look ridiculous. -Yeah, what is this?

25:25.157 --> 25:26.690
[Nicole] Hey, mom.

25:26.692 --> 25:28.559
There's a party at Kenny Killian's tonight.

25:28.561 --> 25:30.561
Can we go?

25:30.563 --> 25:33.797
I feel like this, absolutely, should be out of the question.

25:33.799 --> 25:37.735
Oh, please, oh, fair noble queen!

25:37.737 --> 25:40.070
You may taketh my head on the morrow,

25:40.072 --> 25:44.275
but tonight let me partake in the revelry.

25:44.277 --> 25:47.545
-[chuckles] -Oh, come on, please!

25:47.547 --> 25:48.846
I don't know, I feel like Sadie

25:48.848 --> 25:50.281
doesn't wanna go to a high-school party.

25:50.283 --> 25:52.783
No, I don't mind chaperoning these butt-heads.

25:52.785 --> 25:56.287
But we go under one condition. We go in costume.

25:56.289 --> 25:58.656
-[laughs] -Yeah?

25:58.658 --> 26:01.225
-That's hilarious. -I don't know.

26:01.227 --> 26:03.794
-[clucking] -Come on!

26:03.796 --> 26:05.930
Get you changed, anyway.

26:06.866 --> 26:09.333
Looks like you two had fun.

26:09.335 --> 26:12.937
Yeah, we did. Nicole feels like a little sister to me.

26:12.939 --> 26:16.941
So... does she confide in you?

26:16.943 --> 26:18.576
-Don't... -Do what?

26:18.578 --> 26:21.178
Don't turn me into an informant, Chloe.

26:21.981 --> 26:23.347
I'm not.

26:24.884 --> 26:27.351
I would just say...

26:27.353 --> 26:29.219
don't assume things

26:29.221 --> 26:33.190
'cause... she's a good girl.

26:35.695 --> 26:36.961
Okay?

26:37.964 --> 26:39.229
You look pretty.

26:40.967 --> 26:42.366
[Nicole] I feel like we shouldn't have brought you here,

26:42.368 --> 26:43.867
you know?

26:45.071 --> 26:48.038
[Sadie] Yeah, you should have.

26:48.040 --> 26:49.873
I don't know what we were thinking.

26:49.875 --> 26:52.343
-I can't go in like this. -Yes, you can.

26:52.345 --> 26:54.211
You can do literally whatever you want in high school

26:54.213 --> 26:57.214
as long as you have one thing, confidence.

26:57.216 --> 26:58.882
[sighs]

26:58.884 --> 27:01.185
Shay! Shay! Shay! Shay!

27:01.187 --> 27:04.822
-[both] Shay! Shay! Shay! Shay! -Oh! Oh, my God!

27:04.824 --> 27:07.391
[door creaking]

27:07.393 --> 27:10.661
[instrumental music]

27:19.639 --> 27:22.706
[indistinct chatter]

27:37.790 --> 27:40.090
[laughter]

27:40.092 --> 27:41.792
Crazy.

27:49.702 --> 27:53.270
-Come on in. -Let's go out.

27:53.272 --> 27:56.740
Get a bite to eat. It'll be like a proper date.

27:56.742 --> 27:59.376
Mm, my feet hurt.

27:59.378 --> 28:01.078
Come on, let's just order in

28:01.080 --> 28:03.814
and that way we can fuck while we wait.

28:03.816 --> 28:07.718
-[chuckles] Don't do that. -Do what?

28:07.720 --> 28:09.086
Try to distract me from the fact

28:09.088 --> 28:11.755
that you don't wanna be seen with me.

28:11.757 --> 28:13.757
-Ever. -Aw...

28:13.759 --> 28:16.193
-Look, it's just-- -Come on in. Okay?

28:16.195 --> 28:19.063
And you're cute when you pout.

28:19.065 --> 28:20.464
[indistinct chatter]

28:20.466 --> 28:22.066
-Good one! -[laughter]

28:22.068 --> 28:24.034
-Nicole? -Derek!

28:24.036 --> 28:27.838
-What are you doin' here? -What am I doing here?

28:27.840 --> 28:30.107
-This is my Aunt Sadie. -[Derek] Oh!

28:30.109 --> 28:33.010
-I-I heard a lot about you. -Oh, yeah?

28:33.012 --> 28:34.411
What have you heard?

28:34.413 --> 28:36.280
Um, I heard you saved

28:36.282 --> 28:37.948
my girlfriend's life when she was little.

28:37.950 --> 28:40.284
Did he just say the G word?

28:40.286 --> 28:44.421
Well, you take care of this one. She's literally the best.

28:44.423 --> 28:47.024
I got my eye on you.

28:47.860 --> 28:50.160
Cheers to that, I guess.

28:52.031 --> 28:54.465
-Will you be a doll? -Yeah.

28:54.467 --> 28:56.400
[indistinct chatter]

28:56.402 --> 28:59.069
Nicky, he's hot! [burps]

28:59.071 --> 29:01.872
I'm just happy she's back.

29:01.874 --> 29:05.042
And it could be good for Nicole, too.

29:05.044 --> 29:08.011
And when are we gonna tell her and Shay about us?

29:09.448 --> 29:12.916
Well, w-what is it that we should be telling exactly?

29:12.918 --> 29:15.853
The truth, that we like spending time together

29:15.855 --> 29:19.156
and-and maybe that'll become something in the future

29:19.158 --> 29:22.893
or maybe it won't, but right now something is happening.

29:22.895 --> 29:26.230
Mm... not yet.

29:26.232 --> 29:29.066
Give Nicole some credit. She can take it.

29:29.068 --> 29:33.437
Sometimes I think that you're trying to keep her a kid.

29:33.439 --> 29:36.240
I'm not trying to prevent her from growing up.

29:36.242 --> 29:38.408
I'm doing the exact opposite.

29:39.111 --> 29:40.410
Okay.

29:42.047 --> 29:46.083
Look, they're gonna be adults in a hot minute,

29:46.085 --> 29:48.218
which means we'll have plenty of time to figure out

29:48.220 --> 29:50.320
what to do with ourselves.

29:55.227 --> 29:57.261
Okay.

29:57.263 --> 30:00.330
[cheering]

30:01.801 --> 30:04.868
[party music]

30:14.346 --> 30:16.346
[Sadie] Whoo-hoo!

30:32.364 --> 30:35.132
-I thought you would want this. -Huh?

30:35.134 --> 30:36.600
I-I thought you would want this.

30:36.602 --> 30:40.604
Oh, yeah! You're totally right. Cheers.

30:41.841 --> 30:44.441
-I'm Sadie. Who are you? -Kenny.

30:44.443 --> 30:46.844
Oh, you're Kenny! This is your party!

30:46.846 --> 30:50.147
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. -Oh, cool!

30:50.149 --> 30:51.615
I like your mask.

30:51.617 --> 30:54.318
It's cool that you guys, you know, do your own thing.

30:54.320 --> 30:57.988
Yeah, I mean, we like to play.

30:59.925 --> 31:02.526
Where do you go to school?

31:02.528 --> 31:04.628
A-are you a senior?

31:04.630 --> 31:07.231
-Yeah. -Okay.

31:07.233 --> 31:09.867
Yeah. Um...

31:09.869 --> 31:11.635
I'm homeschooled.

31:11.637 --> 31:16.206
But... it's my last year before college.

31:16.208 --> 31:18.342
-Yeah. -Where do you wanna go?

31:18.344 --> 31:21.511
-Columbia. Pre-med. -Oh.

31:21.513 --> 31:25.115
Wow! Beauty and brains.

31:25.117 --> 31:26.884
-Where have you been hiding, S-- -Kenny!

31:26.886 --> 31:28.652
Nah, it's okay.

31:28.654 --> 31:31.421
I have been in hiding.

31:31.423 --> 31:35.025
But now that you've found me...

31:35.027 --> 31:37.394
what are you gonna do about it?

31:39.098 --> 31:40.664
Want to see my room?

31:42.167 --> 31:44.434
-Yeah. -Okay.

31:44.436 --> 31:46.336
[crowd cheering]

31:46.338 --> 31:48.939
-Wow! -Oh, yeah!

31:50.175 --> 31:52.276
What's her deal?

31:54.013 --> 31:55.412
Like, how do you mean?

31:55.414 --> 31:58.115
I mean, can you imagine ever wanting to go

31:58.117 --> 32:00.484
to a high-school party again? Because I can't.

32:00.486 --> 32:04.521
[chuckles] You know, she said she wanted to start over.

32:04.523 --> 32:07.157
That's one way to go about it.

32:07.159 --> 32:08.425
[chuckles]

32:10.296 --> 32:12.963
She's always been a little...

32:12.965 --> 32:13.997
immature.

32:13.999 --> 32:15.933
[Alex] How old is she?

32:15.935 --> 32:17.467
[Chloe] She's 25.

32:18.671 --> 32:20.404
[chuckles]

32:21.540 --> 32:24.074
-Do you wanna sit down? -Oh, yeah, sure.

32:25.945 --> 32:29.012
[party music]

32:57.409 --> 32:59.543
Take off your mask.

33:00.479 --> 33:02.045
How come?

33:03.716 --> 33:06.984
[music continues]

33:12.992 --> 33:15.759
I think I really like you, Kenny.

33:31.610 --> 33:33.643
Kenny.

33:33.645 --> 33:36.480
-What? -I have to go.

33:37.182 --> 33:38.648
Why is that?

33:40.219 --> 33:43.720
My mom is really strict.

33:45.024 --> 33:48.725
-Well, that sucks. -No, it doesn't.

33:48.727 --> 33:51.795
It means she really cares about me.

33:53.065 --> 33:56.533
She's giving me a test tomorrow.

33:56.535 --> 33:58.435
-Because I'm homeschooled. -Oh, yeah, right.

33:58.437 --> 34:00.737
-Remember? -Right.

34:07.212 --> 34:08.678
Bye.

34:14.620 --> 34:16.686
How do I look?

34:17.656 --> 34:19.723
-You look amazing! -Really?

34:19.725 --> 34:22.225
Yeah! Oh, my God!

34:22.226 --> 34:24.460
-Did you do a streak? -Yeah, I did. But don't worry.

34:24.463 --> 34:26.563
This is, like, not my actual hair. I didn't cut it again.

34:26.565 --> 34:28.364
-This is one of nana's wigs. -Okay.

34:28.367 --> 34:31.234
I was, like, chopping it up all last night while you snored.

34:31.235 --> 34:33.703
-I don't snore. -You... Yes, you do!

34:33.705 --> 34:36.572
-I snore? -Yeah. It's cute, though.

34:36.574 --> 34:38.275
It looks good.

34:39.110 --> 34:41.210
-Twins! -Twin...

34:41.213 --> 34:42.712
Hey, did you know that last night, like,

34:42.714 --> 34:45.148
half the party thought that you were our age?

34:45.150 --> 34:46.483
-Really? -Yeah!

34:46.485 --> 34:48.485
-That's stupid. -[chuckles]

34:48.487 --> 34:50.286
My Aunt Sadie's still got it.

34:50.289 --> 34:53.690
[chuckles] Oh, you're boney!

34:53.692 --> 34:57.694
Well, that's why I have my healthy breakfast.

35:15.447 --> 35:17.347
Oh, well... Okay.

35:17.349 --> 35:19.149
Wait, there's two of it!

35:19.151 --> 35:20.884
[laughing] Oh, perfect!

35:22.154 --> 35:24.154
Oh, yeah.

35:24.156 --> 35:25.288
It's beautiful.

-That'd be 22.36. -Okay.

-Thank you, Sadie. -Of course.

35:53.852 --> 35:55.886
[music continues]

35:55.888 --> 35:59.189
Wish me and my sister got along as well as you two.

35:59.191 --> 36:01.291

Whoa. Sadie.

36:17.342 --> 36:18.441
-Oh... -[laughing]

36:18.443 --> 36:19.809
Hey!

36:21.647 --> 36:25.315
I never realized how much you guys look like each other.

36:25.317 --> 36:26.683
-Mm-hmm. -Ah.

36:26.685 --> 36:30.387
[chuckles] How was school today?

36:30.389 --> 36:33.290
It was a nightmare, I seriously almost slapped Serena

36:33.292 --> 36:34.624
to get suspended.

36:34.626 --> 36:36.626
Ha! That's amazing.

36:36.628 --> 36:38.395
Come on, let's go.

36:39.765 --> 36:40.964
So did you skip out of school early?

36:40.966 --> 36:44.267
Uh-uh. Wednesday's a half day.

36:44.269 --> 36:45.602
Hey, we still going to the movie?

36:45.604 --> 36:48.405
Yeah. We could just go over there now.

36:48.407 --> 36:50.207
Play some pinball while we wait.

36:50.209 --> 36:52.275
Oh, does The Old Mill still have pinball machines?

36:52.277 --> 36:53.577
-That's right. -What?

36:53.579 --> 36:54.811
You're pretty good at it, aren't you?

36:54.813 --> 36:56.780
I'm really good at it.

36:56.782 --> 36:59.516
But, uh, I don't think I'm gonna come with you.

36:59.518 --> 37:02.452
-Because I don't feel great. -What's wrong?

37:02.454 --> 37:03.787
Nothin', I'm just kinda like headache-y

37:03.789 --> 37:06.356
and, you know, nauseous.

37:06.358 --> 37:08.692
-We could go home. -No, you guys go to the movies.

37:08.694 --> 37:10.894
I'll go home for a bit and then, like, I'll pick you up after?

37:10.896 --> 37:12.929
Yeah, okay, if that's okay with you.

37:12.931 --> 37:14.798
Yeah, it's totally fine. Just text me.

37:14.800 --> 37:15.932
-Okay. -Okay.

37:15.934 --> 37:19.269
-We'll miss you. -Love you. Bye.

37:19.271 --> 37:22.339
-Feel better. -[Sadie] I will.

37:23.842 --> 37:26.243
Why is she trying to look like you?

37:26.245 --> 37:27.911
Don't you think that's weird?

37:27.913 --> 37:30.747
No. I think it's cool.

37:30.749 --> 37:32.015
Come on.

37:33.685 --> 37:35.452
Come on. Ah.

37:44.730 --> 37:45.762
[Derek] Nicole!

37:45.764 --> 37:48.832
[dramatic music]

38:07.419 --> 38:10.320
Hey! What are you doing?

38:12.658 --> 38:14.057
Nicole!

38:18.463 --> 38:21.531
[music continues]

38:24.369 --> 38:25.735
Hello?

38:37.316 --> 38:38.481
Hey.

38:45.924 --> 38:47.924
[groans] Sadie, I'm sorry.

38:47.926 --> 38:50.360
I, I thought you were Nicole.

38:52.798 --> 38:53.930
[exhales]

38:57.402 --> 38:58.768
A...

39:02.607 --> 39:05.075
-I've never done this before. -Uh...

39:05.077 --> 39:08.044
But I want to, with you.

39:10.882 --> 39:13.450
You won't tell anyone, right?

39:13.452 --> 39:15.719
At school? I-I just don't wanna get a reputation.

39:15.721 --> 39:17.954
It would break my mother's heart.

39:17.956 --> 39:19.689
N-no. I...

39:19.691 --> 39:21.491
-I-I won't tell anyone. -Okay.

39:21.493 --> 39:24.561
[dramatic music]

39:26.832 --> 39:28.398
[Sadie] Is this your first time?

39:28.400 --> 39:31.101
[both breathing heavily]

39:38.910 --> 39:40.677
Derek?

39:41.079 --> 39:44.147
Shh...

[door shuts]

40:01.900 --> 40:04.934
-Anyone home? -[Sadie sobbing]

40:11.009 --> 40:12.475
Nicole?

40:13.512 --> 40:15.912
Nicole? Honey, what's wrong?

40:16.782 --> 40:18.882
[sobbing]

40:20.085 --> 40:22.585
Nicole wanted to give me a haircut

40:22.587 --> 40:24.654
so we'd be twins.

40:24.656 --> 40:27.090
So you wanna, you wanna tell me what's wrong?

40:27.092 --> 40:30.960
I'm gonna be 26 next week!

40:31.897 --> 40:34.731
[sobbing] It's not funny!

40:34.733 --> 40:36.599
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

40:36.601 --> 40:39.636
We can celebrate yours and Nicole's birthday together.

40:39.638 --> 40:40.870
The same time, like we used to.

40:40.872 --> 40:43.807
No, Nicole wants her own party.

40:43.809 --> 40:47.911
Uh, no. She adores you.

40:47.913 --> 40:51.714
I can't remember the last time it was just you and me.

40:51.716 --> 40:54.617
[groans] I love you.

40:54.619 --> 40:56.686
I love you, too!

40:58.190 --> 41:00.790
-[sobbing] -Always.

41:05.130 --> 41:06.930
-Bad TV? -Mm.

41:06.932 --> 41:09.032
-Yeah, bad TV. -Mm-hmm?

41:09.034 --> 41:12.001
-Chinese food from Twin Dragons? -I want Chinese food.

41:12.003 --> 41:13.803
All right, well, I'll go order.

41:13.805 --> 41:16.139
I'm old! [sobbing]

41:16.141 --> 41:18.541
Oh, my God. Those shoes are hideous.

41:18.543 --> 41:21.010
Look how different her nose is in this season...

41:21.012 --> 41:22.045
Wait...

41:22.047 --> 41:23.546
[indistinct chatter]

41:25.183 --> 41:27.484
Right? Like, they say it's not scripted.

41:27.486 --> 41:28.785
But it's clearly...

41:28.787 --> 41:30.854
I thought you were gonna pick us up.

41:32.724 --> 41:34.891
Yeah, I thought you were gonna text me.

41:34.893 --> 41:37.227
Your phone is right there! I texted you multiple times.

41:37.229 --> 41:38.828
Did you really?

41:39.831 --> 41:42.131
Oh, shit! Nicole, I'm sorry!

41:42.133 --> 41:44.868
I didn't see! I'm so stupid!

41:44.870 --> 41:47.871
-How did you get home? -Shay's dad picked us up.

41:47.873 --> 41:50.240
But we had to wait for him to get off of work.

41:50.242 --> 41:52.642
-Is Alex here? -No.

41:52.644 --> 41:54.711
He went home with Shay.

41:54.713 --> 41:56.212
Why do you even care?

41:56.214 --> 41:59.949
Oh, Nicky, you're mad. I'm sorry.

41:59.951 --> 42:01.551
Whatever.

42:01.553 --> 42:03.686
Are you hungry?

42:03.688 --> 42:05.955
We have Chinese.

42:05.957 --> 42:08.525
-Where is it from? -Twin Dragons.

42:08.527 --> 42:10.727
Ugh! That place is fucking gross.

42:10.729 --> 42:11.995
Hey.

42:13.765 --> 42:15.999
Look, I'm sorry there was a mix-up,

42:16.001 --> 42:19.602
but that's no excuse for this attitude.

42:19.604 --> 42:20.904
[scoffs]

42:23.275 --> 42:24.774
I think we should rewind now

42:24.776 --> 42:26.976
'cause now she's crying, so we miss--

42:26.978 --> 42:29.012
Yeah, but she's, like, always crying.

42:29.014 --> 42:30.680
[indistinct chatter]

42:30.682 --> 42:33.182
[Chloe laughs] All right! [Sadie] Fine, fine.

42:33.184 --> 42:34.851
[Chloe] She always cries!

42:34.853 --> 42:37.320
[Sadie] I wonder why she's crying this time.

42:43.695 --> 42:46.763
[cell phone ringing]

-Are we still friends? -Of course.

43:16.027 --> 43:19.329
-I feel like a flake. -No, it's fine, I'm...

43:19.331 --> 43:22.699
Honestly, I feel stupid. I feel like I overreacted.

43:22.701 --> 43:25.635
Mm-mm. No one likes to feel like they've been forgotten.

43:25.637 --> 43:27.136
-I get it. -[exhales sharply]

43:27.138 --> 43:28.705
It's just your mom was feeling lonely,

43:28.707 --> 43:31.107
so I thought I should spend time with her.

43:35.380 --> 43:37.880
[Sadie and Derek breathing heavily]

43:39.618 --> 43:43.786
[Sadie] Derek and Nicole. Nicole and Derek.

Derek?

44:19.724 --> 44:20.957
Yeah?

44:21.926 --> 44:24.360
I think I love you.

44:24.362 --> 44:27.063
Oh, my God! I can't believe I just said that out loud!

44:27.065 --> 44:29.932
I can't believe I just said that out loud!

44:29.934 --> 44:31.200
Ah...

44:34.039 --> 44:36.005
Hey, you don't have to say it back.

44:36.007 --> 44:38.041
When you do say, I-I want it to be spontaneous.

44:38.043 --> 44:41.377
That's the only way that I'll know it's real. Okay?

44:41.379 --> 44:43.846
-Okay? Okay? Okay? -[Derek] Okay.

44:43.848 --> 44:46.049
[laughing]

44:48.987 --> 44:52.321
Well, now I know exactly what I'm gonna wish for my birthday.

44:53.091 --> 44:54.691
[giggles]

44:55.193 --> 44:57.293
[intense music]

44:58.096 --> 45:01.164
[instrumental music]

45:21.753 --> 45:23.252
What did y'all wish for?

45:23.254 --> 45:26.322
[sing song] Oh, we'll never tell.

45:32.497 --> 45:35.131
-[party horn blares] -[laughs]

45:35.133 --> 45:37.834
[Sadie] I'm here for you. [Nicole] Not for me.

45:37.836 --> 45:40.203
[indistinct chatter]

45:40.205 --> 45:42.038
[Nicole] Thank you.

45:44.409 --> 45:46.075
[laughs]

45:48.113 --> 45:50.046
Let's cut some cake.

45:51.416 --> 45:53.349
Birthday girls...

45:59.758 --> 46:01.824
[indistinct chatter]

46:03.461 --> 46:04.894
Okay, now...

46:08.199 --> 46:09.432
Thanks.

46:09.434 --> 46:10.967
Do you want me to load the dishwasher?

46:10.969 --> 46:12.301
-You're the birthday girl. -No.

46:12.303 --> 46:13.870
Nicole's the birthday girl.

46:13.872 --> 46:16.906
-Mine's the day after tomorrow. -Okay.

46:16.908 --> 46:19.175
It's funny that your dad's here, huh?

46:19.177 --> 46:22.245
Chloe said I should invite him. He never passes up cake.

46:22.247 --> 46:23.513
Oh.

46:24.983 --> 46:26.349
Wow.

46:28.119 --> 46:30.887
You know, Shay, I think...

46:32.557 --> 46:35.024
I think you're very...

46:35.026 --> 46:37.827
-What? -Ah, it's not my place to say.

46:37.829 --> 46:41.097
Sadie, what are you talking about?

46:41.099 --> 46:44.000
I just think you're being very immature

46:44.002 --> 46:45.935
about all this, you know?

46:45.937 --> 46:48.137
No, I don't know.

46:48.139 --> 46:51.240
Oh, are you se... Mm!

46:51.242 --> 46:56.078
I'm so sorry. Like, just... Forget I said anything.

46:56.080 --> 46:58.481
No, whatever's going on, you know you have to tell me now.

46:58.483 --> 47:00.483
-Right? -Hm.

47:01.820 --> 47:04.187
Yeah, I guess that's true. Um...

47:06.291 --> 47:08.357
Let's take out the trash.

47:11.963 --> 47:13.596
I better get going.

47:13.598 --> 47:16.399
-[door opens] -Already?

47:16.401 --> 47:18.334
-[door shuts] -Yeah.

47:21.039 --> 47:23.139
Well, I-I'll come with you.

47:23.141 --> 47:26.008
[Alex] That's not the only...

47:26.010 --> 47:27.410
I-I'm surprised you didn't know

47:27.412 --> 47:30.313
because, like, Nicole acted like you knew.

47:30.315 --> 47:33.950
-Knew what? -About Chloe and your dad.

47:33.952 --> 47:35.885
What about them?

47:35.887 --> 47:37.954
Well, you know, that they're...

47:39.123 --> 47:42.625
-Wait, are you serious? -Yeah.

47:42.627 --> 47:44.360
-For how long? -I don't know.

47:44.362 --> 47:46.963
-A while now. -How long has Nicole known?

47:46.965 --> 47:48.531
I think, like, a few weeks or something.

47:48.533 --> 47:51.534
-A few weeks? -I know. It's shitty.

47:51.536 --> 47:53.970
Come here. It's fine.

47:55.073 --> 47:56.639
What's wrong?

47:57.208 --> 47:58.641
Nothing.

47:59.611 --> 48:02.411
Come on. Nothing's wrong?

48:02.413 --> 48:04.413
No.

48:04.415 --> 48:07.250
Then why are you being such a dick to me on my birthday?

48:09.954 --> 48:12.455
I didn't expect a gift,

48:12.457 --> 48:16.225
but might've been nice.

48:16.227 --> 48:18.527
Or just like a gesture

48:18.529 --> 48:22.398
or maybe even just responding to my text.

48:26.237 --> 48:28.905
I'm sorry, I just...

48:28.907 --> 48:30.373
I got some stuff going on now

48:30.375 --> 48:34.043
and it's kind of a lot to deal with right now.

48:34.045 --> 48:37.113
All right. I'm sorry.

48:37.115 --> 48:38.514
What's wrong?

48:40.351 --> 48:43.052
I'm not really ready to talk about it yet.

48:44.222 --> 48:45.554
Okay.

48:46.491 --> 48:48.090
I understand.

48:50.962 --> 48:53.362
You know I'm here for you

48:53.364 --> 48:55.431
if you wanna talk about it.

48:57.568 --> 48:59.335
Happy birthday.

49:12.350 --> 49:13.616
Goodnight.

49:13.618 --> 49:15.551
-Hey, we gotta go. -[Alex] What's up?

49:15.553 --> 49:17.353
We gotta go.

49:17.355 --> 49:19.288
-Now? -Yeah.

49:20.525 --> 49:21.991
Okay.

49:33.972 --> 49:35.738
Wait, what... Shay?

49:36.407 --> 49:37.673
[car door shuts]

49:38.643 --> 49:40.376
What happened?

49:40.378 --> 49:42.144
It's okay, it's okay.

49:42.146 --> 49:44.080
Happy birthday, okay?

49:45.516 --> 49:48.584
"It's okay..." What's okay?

49:48.586 --> 49:52.021
[Alex] I-I... I'll talk to you later, all right?

49:52.590 --> 49:54.457
Shay!

49:54.459 --> 49:55.658
[engine starts]

49:55.660 --> 49:57.727
You're not gonna look at me?

50:02.533 --> 50:06.302
Bye! Have a great night. Thanks for coming.

50:14.479 --> 50:16.078
Thanks.

50:27.291 --> 50:28.724
Oh, you smell nice.

50:28.726 --> 50:30.726
Why did Shay leave?

50:32.697 --> 50:34.263
I don't know.

50:34.265 --> 50:36.465
She didn't even say goodbye.

50:37.335 --> 50:38.734
This sucks.

50:41.773 --> 50:44.740
Do you wanna go bowling or see a movie?

50:44.742 --> 50:48.411
Bowling on my 18th birthday with my mom.

50:48.413 --> 50:50.646
That sounds like a lot of fun.

50:53.651 --> 50:55.718
Well, why don't you grab the last plate and we'll--

50:55.720 --> 50:58.587
I'm not fucking cleaning!

50:58.589 --> 51:00.823
It's my birthday!

51:00.825 --> 51:04.660
-Go to your room. -Go to my room?

51:04.662 --> 51:07.396
Are you fucking kidding me?

51:07.398 --> 51:09.832
Do I look like I'm kidding you?

51:09.834 --> 51:12.101
You're a dumb cunt.

51:13.704 --> 51:15.738
-[both grunting] -Get off of me!

51:15.740 --> 51:19.308
-Hey! -[indistinct yelling]

51:19.310 --> 51:21.777
[groans]

51:21.779 --> 51:23.846
What is wrong with you?

51:26.284 --> 51:27.483
[door shuts]

51:27.485 --> 51:28.651
[sobbing]

51:32.857 --> 51:36.125
[sobbing]

51:37.095 --> 51:38.594
[sobbing]

51:38.596 --> 51:41.664
Oh, no! Please, don't cry.

51:42.567 --> 51:45.167
-[sniffles] -Aw...

51:47.872 --> 51:52.308
Hey, it's okay. You're doing your best, Chloe.

51:52.310 --> 51:55.744
You are. I see it. I see it all the time.

51:55.746 --> 51:57.813
You work really hard and...

51:59.484 --> 52:00.749
I mean, I honestly don't think anyone should

52:00.751 --> 52:02.418
be able to talk to you like that,

52:02.420 --> 52:04.653
especially not your own daughter.

52:06.324 --> 52:09.158
-[rock music on stereo] -[sniffles]

52:09.160 --> 52:11.627
-I should go say something. -No, no, no, no, I just...

52:11.629 --> 52:14.196
I think that'd make things worse, don't you?

52:14.198 --> 52:17.266
Just, like, maybe let it settle.

52:17.268 --> 52:20.302
Let it cool off and then I can go talk to her.

52:20.304 --> 52:21.470
Yeah?

52:22.173 --> 52:23.439
[Chloe sighs]

52:25.576 --> 52:27.243
Calm down.

52:36.721 --> 52:38.888
I'm glad you're here.

52:38.890 --> 52:41.223
¶ ...wasted time ¶

[music continues]

53:18.329 --> 53:20.896
-Here. -Thanks.

53:23.935 --> 53:26.202
Do you think I could have one?

53:27.271 --> 53:29.872
Uh... yeah.

53:29.874 --> 53:32.741
-[chuckles] -Okay!

53:33.844 --> 53:35.211
Mm-mm!

53:38.716 --> 53:40.683
Hey, I wanted to ask you, um, I was thinking

53:40.685 --> 53:45.254
about getting my GED 'cause I have these online classes and--

53:45.256 --> 53:46.355
Yeah.

53:47.692 --> 53:49.625
I think that's, that's great.

53:49.627 --> 53:52.528
-Yeah? You think so? -Absolutely.

53:52.530 --> 53:55.497
I just, I've always been such a slow learner.

53:58.869 --> 54:00.769
No, you haven't.

54:00.771 --> 54:04.907
You just never really a-applied yourself, but...

54:06.577 --> 54:09.245
I think this is a perfect first step.

54:09.247 --> 54:11.313
Do you think maybe, like, you could help me sometimes

54:11.315 --> 54:13.249
if it's hard?

54:16.487 --> 54:17.753
Absolutely.

54:17.755 --> 54:20.356
Yay! It'll be like homeschool!

54:22.360 --> 54:24.727
Yeah. I guess.

54:28.866 --> 54:31.900
[mellow music]

54:34.272 --> 54:35.738
[Sadie] Hey.

54:36.974 --> 54:38.574
You okay?

54:39.610 --> 54:42.011
Yeah? Is it okay if I sit here?

54:46.651 --> 54:49.718
I'm sorry that this all happened on your birthday.

54:49.720 --> 54:52.054
I know it's not what you planned, but...

54:54.292 --> 54:56.959
[sighs] Try not to be too hard on your mom.

54:56.961 --> 54:59.328
I think this whole thing that Shay's dad is turning out

54:59.330 --> 55:01.964
to be way more serious than she thought.

55:01.966 --> 55:03.766
What? What do you mean?

55:03.768 --> 55:05.768
Well, just that she's really stressed out about it.

55:05.770 --> 55:09.638
-No, what thing with Shay's dad? -That they're seeing each other.

55:12.910 --> 55:15.311
-Mom and Alex? -Wait, you didn't know?

55:15.313 --> 55:18.580
Are you serious? She hasn't told you?

55:20.017 --> 55:22.351
Okay, well, I'm sure she's going to tell you, but...

55:22.353 --> 55:24.486
-Jesus! -Does Shay know?

55:24.488 --> 55:26.055
I don't know.

55:28.459 --> 55:31.894
That's why she's been ignoring my texts.

55:31.896 --> 55:35.030
Oh, Nicole, please, please,

55:35.032 --> 55:38.667
don't tell your mom that I told you.

55:38.669 --> 55:41.870
That bitch is the last person I wanna talk to right now.

55:41.872 --> 55:44.940
[intense music]

56:02.793 --> 56:05.928
I'm flying!

56:05.930 --> 56:08.831
[Young Nicole laughing]

56:10.735 --> 56:13.035
[Young Nicole screaming]

56:16.507 --> 56:19.575

56:29.153 --> 56:32.421

[Sadie laughing]

56:52.676 --> 56:55.744
[laughter]

56:58.983 --> 57:01.183
[Sadie] I want my mom.

57:05.923 --> 57:08.690
-Hey. -Hey.

57:12.730 --> 57:14.663
-Did Nicole leave? -[Sadie] Yeah, she must have.

57:14.665 --> 57:16.899
She wasn't here when I woke up.

57:18.702 --> 57:21.136
[scoffs] I wanted to talk to her

57:21.138 --> 57:23.739
before she left, but...

57:23.741 --> 57:26.508
[sighs] Last night was...

57:29.780 --> 57:31.947
[Sadie] Yeah, but you didn't do anything wrong.

57:33.851 --> 57:38.454
Can you please just, I don' know, ask her to call me?

57:38.456 --> 57:40.489
[Sadie] Yeah, but I think I know what's up with her.

57:40.491 --> 57:43.025
-Really? -Uh-huh.

57:43.027 --> 57:45.127
-What is it? -We talked last night.

57:45.129 --> 57:47.062
And she and Shay think there's something going on

57:47.064 --> 57:49.531
with you and Alex.

57:49.533 --> 57:51.533
Which is silly, right?

57:52.736 --> 57:55.571
-[scoffs] -So you are seeing...

57:55.573 --> 57:57.206
You are seeing Alex?

57:57.208 --> 57:59.908
I didn't wanna tell anyone

57:59.910 --> 58:04.046
until I knew if it was gonna...

58:04.048 --> 58:07.149
be a, a thing or-or go somewhere.

58:07.151 --> 58:10.519
A-and is it, um, you know, going anywhere?

58:12.756 --> 58:14.890
Could be. I-I guess.

58:16.560 --> 58:17.926
I mean...

58:20.064 --> 58:24.266
[chuckles] When we first started out...

58:24.268 --> 58:26.668
it had been a while since,

58:26.670 --> 58:30.038
you know, I had sex with a person.

58:30.040 --> 58:32.875
And... I don't know, I don't know

58:32.877 --> 58:36.078
if it's just... me

58:36.080 --> 58:37.846
and my age or something

58:37.848 --> 58:39.515
which I kinda read about

58:39.517 --> 58:41.817
or, like, if he's super good at oral, which I think--

58:41.819 --> 58:45.554
Oh, my God! I can't hear this! I can't hear this!

58:45.556 --> 58:48.190
Stop!

58:50.227 --> 58:52.294
You're k-kidding, right?

58:53.864 --> 58:55.864
Yeah.

58:55.866 --> 58:57.933
Of course.

58:57.935 --> 59:00.302
Sorry, that was a bad joke.

59:01.939 --> 59:03.171
[intense music]

59:03.173 --> 59:05.541
Why are you ignoring me?

59:07.244 --> 59:09.912
Look, I know that this whole thing is really awkward,

59:09.914 --> 59:11.680
but it's not like any of it was my fault.

59:11.682 --> 59:14.616
-You should've told me. -I just found out last night!

59:14.618 --> 59:15.884
-I don't believe you. -Why not?

59:15.886 --> 59:17.653
'Cause you knew I'd freak out and then

59:17.655 --> 59:19.054
you wouldn't have the little family you always wanted.

59:19.056 --> 59:21.557
-What? Shay, that is so... -Okay.

59:21.559 --> 59:23.959
-That is so stupid! -What about my family?

59:23.961 --> 59:25.127
My mom and dad aren't even divorced.

59:25.129 --> 59:26.662
-They're just separated. -Stop!

59:26.664 --> 59:30.832
Okay, Nicole! Okay.

59:30.834 --> 59:34.236
-Shay, seriously! Shay! -Are you gonna hit me now?

59:34.238 --> 59:36.238
That's what you do when you don't get your way, right?

59:36.240 --> 59:38.173
-But I-- Wait! -Just leave me alone!

59:38.175 --> 59:41.243
Just tell me! How did you find out last night?

59:41.245 --> 59:45.080
-Sadie. -What?

59:45.082 --> 59:47.749
[Sadie] "Mom, I just feel like

59:47.751 --> 59:50.085
Nicole is around all the time.

59:50.087 --> 59:52.588
And she always copies me."

59:52.590 --> 59:56.959
[gasps] "I know, Sadie. I see it happening.

59:56.961 --> 59:59.294
I wish there was a way I could help."

59:59.296 --> 01:00:03.298
[gasps] "That's it, mom. That's what we should do.

01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:06.101
We should send Nicole away.

01:00:06.103 --> 01:00:08.870
But, but how?"

01:00:08.872 --> 01:00:11.640
"I don't know. Maybe boarding school."

01:00:11.642 --> 01:00:12.975
"I heard you!"

01:00:12.977 --> 01:00:15.611
[gasps] "Oh, Nicole!

01:00:15.613 --> 01:00:17.846
Nicole, now just calm down."

01:00:17.848 --> 01:00:19.381
"No!"

01:00:30.894 --> 01:00:33.829
[intense music]

01:00:33.831 --> 01:00:35.931
"Mom!" "Sadie!"

01:00:35.933 --> 01:00:37.899
"Oh, thank God, you're okay.

01:00:37.901 --> 01:00:40.936
I don't know what I would do without you."

01:00:40.938 --> 01:00:45.040
"Oh, mom, now we're... Now, we're free.

01:00:45.042 --> 01:00:46.808
Now, it's just the two of us."

01:00:46.810 --> 01:00:48.777
[doorbell rings]

01:00:54.084 --> 01:00:56.652
Hey, Sadie.

01:00:56.654 --> 01:01:00.355
-Is, uh, is Chloe here? -No, you just missed her.

01:01:00.357 --> 01:01:03.825
Okay. I'll give her a call. Thanks.

01:01:03.827 --> 01:01:07.129
Wait, why don't you... Hey! Uh...

01:01:07.131 --> 01:01:09.264
Do you wanna come in for some coffee?

01:01:09.266 --> 01:01:12.034
-Nah, I-- -No, come on. Come in.

01:01:12.036 --> 01:01:13.435
Come on.

01:01:14.438 --> 01:01:15.937
Thanks.

01:01:17.174 --> 01:01:18.807
You drove here?

01:01:18.809 --> 01:01:21.877
[dog barking]

01:01:24.948 --> 01:01:27.449
[Sadie] So she was really upset?

01:01:27.451 --> 01:01:29.785
Yeah. I mean, you know Nicole.

01:01:29.787 --> 01:01:32.354
She's strong.

01:01:32.356 --> 01:01:35.257
She pushed me all the way back.

01:01:35.259 --> 01:01:38.293
-I'm sorry. -Mm...

01:01:38.295 --> 01:01:40.896
Chloe says that she worries about her temper,

01:01:40.898 --> 01:01:43.865
and... I-I can see that.

01:01:43.867 --> 01:01:45.333
-Mm-hmm. -I think she's right.

01:01:45.335 --> 01:01:47.202
Yeah.

01:01:47.204 --> 01:01:49.871
[sighs] I don't know.

01:01:49.873 --> 01:01:52.474
Maybe it's for the best.

01:01:52.476 --> 01:01:54.109
I don't think Shay has really dealt

01:01:54.111 --> 01:01:57.913
with the separation very well.

01:01:57.915 --> 01:02:00.315
I think she thinks that things are gonna work out

01:02:00.317 --> 01:02:02.951
with her mom and me, but, um...

01:02:05.923 --> 01:02:07.956
they're not, so...

01:02:09.359 --> 01:02:11.793
So what are you doing with Chloe?

01:02:12.930 --> 01:02:16.231
-Hm? -What are your intentions?

01:02:16.233 --> 01:02:20.168
[chuckles] I've known Chloe forever.

01:02:20.170 --> 01:02:23.105
I've always liked her and, um...

01:02:24.108 --> 01:02:26.441
I guess I don't know...

01:02:26.443 --> 01:02:29.010
when exactly I fell in love with her.

01:02:29.012 --> 01:02:31.913
[intense music]

01:02:33.283 --> 01:02:34.750
[chuckles]

01:02:36.086 --> 01:02:38.954
I've never said that to her.

01:02:38.956 --> 01:02:41.056
I've never said that out loud.

01:02:44.428 --> 01:02:49.131
I think, um, if we could keep that as our little...

01:02:49.133 --> 01:02:51.233
our little secret, you know?

01:02:56.006 --> 01:02:58.507
-You know, Sadie? Right. -Mm-hmm. Yeah.

01:02:58.509 --> 01:03:02.177
-[Alex] Okay. -Our little secret.

01:03:02.179 --> 01:03:04.479
Will you just wait one second? I'll be right back.

01:03:04.481 --> 01:03:07.549
[eerie music]

01:03:11.155 --> 01:03:14.122
[intense music]

01:03:14.124 --> 01:03:16.324
[Sadie] You are seeing Alex? I want my mom.

01:03:16.326 --> 01:03:20.996
[Alex] I fell in love with her. [Sadie] My pretty Sadie.

01:03:20.998 --> 01:03:23.532
[Sadie] You know, come home and then...

01:03:23.534 --> 01:03:26.101
um, maybe start over?

01:03:26.103 --> 01:03:28.136
[sobbing] I want my mom.

01:03:28.138 --> 01:03:31.006
Your mom is the strongest person I've seen...

01:03:31.008 --> 01:03:33.875
I can't remember the last time it was just you and me.

01:03:33.877 --> 01:03:35.977
[Chloe] I love you, baby girl.

01:03:35.979 --> 01:03:38.313
[Sadie] Your mom was basically all I had.

01:03:38.315 --> 01:03:42.083
You can always talk to her. Always.

01:03:42.085 --> 01:03:44.820
[Sadie] Would you mind giving me a hand?

01:03:44.822 --> 01:03:47.088
There's a box I need to get down in the garage.

01:03:47.090 --> 01:03:50.192
[water running]

01:03:53.130 --> 01:03:55.497
Thanks for the coffee. I should, uh...

01:03:57.234 --> 01:04:00.602
-I should probably go. -Yeah, no problem.

01:04:00.604 --> 01:04:04.339
Um, before you go, could you just help me, uh, in the garage?

01:04:04.341 --> 01:04:08.043
There's a box I need to get down before I leave.

01:04:08.045 --> 01:04:12.314
-Like, you're leaving leaving? -Uh-huh.

01:04:12.316 --> 01:04:14.015
Yeah, I mean, you know,

01:04:14.017 --> 01:04:15.851
I don't wanna get in the way of you and Chloe.

01:04:15.853 --> 01:04:17.886
You guys deserve to be happy.

01:04:17.888 --> 01:04:19.588
No, I'm...

01:04:22.025 --> 01:04:24.359
That's not what I meant. I'm sorry, that's not what I meant.

01:04:24.361 --> 01:04:27.262
I... You're not in the way of anything.

01:04:28.599 --> 01:04:31.266
Can you help me still?

01:04:31.268 --> 01:04:34.202
I mean, yeah. Yeah, of course.

01:04:36.573 --> 01:04:39.641
[intense music]

01:04:52.322 --> 01:04:55.090
Oh, yeah, this is an old family thing.

01:04:56.927 --> 01:04:59.294
[Alex] You still play with it? [Sadie] Mn-mn.

01:04:59.296 --> 01:05:02.364
It's just up there. That box.

01:05:03.667 --> 01:05:06.501
[Alex] Sadie's things. Right. [Sadie] Uh-huh.

01:05:07.671 --> 01:05:10.038
[clanging]

01:05:10.908 --> 01:05:13.975

-[grunting] -[Alex groans]

01:05:53.250 --> 01:05:54.616
[Alex] Please.

01:05:54.618 --> 01:05:58.019
No, you can't have her!

01:06:03.994 --> 01:06:06.995

Where's...

01:08:51.461 --> 01:08:52.660

-Hey, shh! -[Alex groaning]

01:09:01.604 --> 01:09:03.770
Hey! Hey! Okay!

01:09:05.876 --> 01:09:08.843

-What are you doing? -Hey!

01:10:25.488 --> 01:10:27.555
Oh, you look different.

01:10:27.557 --> 01:10:30.358
I don't wanna look like you anymore, Sadie.

01:10:31.628 --> 01:10:33.228
Okay, well, I guess it's a good thing

01:10:33.230 --> 01:10:34.762
you're developing your own sense of style.

01:10:34.764 --> 01:10:37.532
-What are you doing? -Oh. I was washing my hands.

01:10:37.534 --> 01:10:40.368
-'Cause-- -No, you know what I mean.

01:10:40.370 --> 01:10:42.337
No, I don't. I really don't, Nicky.

01:10:42.339 --> 01:10:44.372
Don't call me that.

01:10:44.374 --> 01:10:46.874
Okay, fine. Nicole!

01:10:46.876 --> 01:10:49.644
You told Shay about mom and Alex.

01:10:49.646 --> 01:10:52.347
-No, I didn't. -You're lying.

01:10:53.717 --> 01:10:55.950
Why are you trying to ruin my life?

01:10:55.952 --> 01:10:58.953
That's... I don't even know what that is.

01:10:58.955 --> 01:11:00.321
That's crazy!

01:11:00.323 --> 01:11:03.524
What did I ever do to you?

01:11:03.526 --> 01:11:06.561
You're the reason Derek stopped talking to me, aren't you?

01:11:07.964 --> 01:11:11.032
You tell him some kind of stories about me?

01:11:11.034 --> 01:11:13.368
Look, I really don't know what you're talking about.

01:11:13.370 --> 01:11:15.803
But I love you an...

01:11:15.805 --> 01:11:19.407
Hey! Come on! Why are you... What the...

01:11:49.606 --> 01:11:51.439
Geez!

-Sadie! -[gasps] Hey.

01:12:22.906 --> 01:12:25.006
-What are you doin'? -Look...

01:12:25.008 --> 01:12:28.476
[sighs] I don't wanna cause problems and...

01:12:28.478 --> 01:12:30.078
I-I feel like I'm just getting in the way here

01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:31.746
'cause, like, the whole thing's...

01:12:31.748 --> 01:12:34.682
-Don't freak out. -Oh, my...

01:12:34.684 --> 01:12:38.052
-What happened? -It was an accident.

01:12:38.054 --> 01:12:40.021
-So what happened? -Okay, fine.

01:12:40.023 --> 01:12:42.657
Um, I was trying to explain to Nicole

01:12:42.659 --> 01:12:45.760
that I didn't tell Shay about you and Alex,

01:12:45.762 --> 01:12:47.595
because how would I know about you two--

01:12:47.597 --> 01:12:50.531
Uh... Ho-ho-hold on.

01:12:50.533 --> 01:12:53.568
-Did she hit you? -Okay, it was an accident!

01:12:53.570 --> 01:12:55.937
It's not like that! It was just a... It was an argument.

01:12:55.939 --> 01:12:57.638
And she got carried away.

01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:00.141
I don't think that she meant to hurt me, Chloe.

01:13:00.143 --> 01:13:02.477
I'm sorry. You're not going anywhere.

01:13:02.479 --> 01:13:04.445
This is ridiculous!

01:13:04.447 --> 01:13:06.948
-[door opens] -[rain splattering]

01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:11.953
Where have you been?

01:13:11.955 --> 01:13:14.489
[scoffs] You know me.

01:13:14.491 --> 01:13:18.626
Off doing drugs and having unprotected sex.

01:13:20.163 --> 01:13:21.863
Sit down.

01:13:25.402 --> 01:13:27.435
Sit down!

01:13:38.114 --> 01:13:39.914
You hit Sadie?

01:13:42.185 --> 01:13:44.519
Come on!

01:13:44.521 --> 01:13:47.755
You're going back to school next week, and when you do,

01:13:47.757 --> 01:13:49.424
you're gonna start seeing the counselor.

01:13:49.426 --> 01:13:51.793
-I didn't touch her! -Yeah.

01:13:51.795 --> 01:13:53.895
Well, you know, I wanted to call the cops

01:13:53.897 --> 01:13:55.430
because nothing else will get through to you.

01:13:55.432 --> 01:13:58.533
Mom, she... She does this. She's a liar.

01:13:58.535 --> 01:14:00.101
She's lying to you!

01:14:00.103 --> 01:14:01.702
I guess you're just gonna have to tell the counselor

01:14:01.704 --> 01:14:03.137
all about it.

01:14:05.141 --> 01:14:07.008
Goodnight, Nicole.

01:14:09.712 --> 01:14:11.879
[intense music]

01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:24.859
Hey, Nicky.

01:14:28.565 --> 01:14:30.131
[Nicole sighs]

01:14:38.107 --> 01:14:40.475
Sadie. [chuckles]

01:14:42.645 --> 01:14:45.213
A little black eye?

01:14:45.215 --> 01:14:48.716
I could do much worse than that.

01:14:48.718 --> 01:14:50.985
Don't, Nicky. You're scaring me.

01:14:50.987 --> 01:14:53.221
You should be scared.

01:14:57.994 --> 01:15:02.129
If you don't leave me and my mom alone,

01:15:02.131 --> 01:15:04.232
I really will hurt you.

01:15:05.969 --> 01:15:09.971
I know you don't mean that. You're just confused.

01:15:13.676 --> 01:15:15.576
-Ow! -[door opens]

01:15:15.578 --> 01:15:16.944
[door slams]

01:15:25.755 --> 01:15:29.891
[Nicole on recorder] Sadie. [chuckles]

01:15:29.893 --> 01:15:32.727
A little black eye?

01:15:32.729 --> 01:15:35.062
I could do much worse than that.

01:15:35.064 --> 01:15:37.698
[Sadie on recorder] Don't, Nicky. You're scaring me.

01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:39.166
[Nicole on recorder] If you don't leave me

01:15:39.168 --> 01:15:42.203
and-and my mom alone,

01:15:42.205 --> 01:15:44.305
I really will hurt you.

01:15:44.307 --> 01:15:47.575
[intense music]

01:15:54.551 --> 01:15:56.984
[knocking on door]

01:15:56.986 --> 01:15:59.153
Shay! Come on in.

01:15:59.155 --> 01:16:02.623
-Hey. What's wrong? -Have you heard from my dad?

01:16:03.293 --> 01:16:04.759
No, I haven't. Why?

01:16:04.761 --> 01:16:06.294
Because I can't get a hold of him.

01:16:06.296 --> 01:16:07.895
I even tried him at work and they said

01:16:07.897 --> 01:16:09.063
he didn't come in today.

01:16:09.065 --> 01:16:10.765
Did he say that he had

01:16:10.767 --> 01:16:12.600
anything to do?

01:16:12.602 --> 01:16:16.037
Something's wrong. He wouldn't just disappear on me like this.

01:16:16.039 --> 01:16:17.805
All right. All right. Well, let's, let's figure this out.

01:16:17.807 --> 01:16:19.874
Okay? Let's, let's call the police.

01:16:21.144 --> 01:16:23.277
[Chloe] Mm-hmm.

01:16:23.279 --> 01:16:26.080
Okay. Well, thank you, officer.

01:16:26.082 --> 01:16:27.648
Bye.

01:16:31.220 --> 01:16:34.589
Well, the good news is,

01:16:34.591 --> 01:16:36.791
there have been no local accidents today

01:16:36.793 --> 01:16:38.960
and he's not in the hospital.

01:16:38.962 --> 01:16:41.696
And the cops are gonna let us know if they,

01:16:41.698 --> 01:16:44.365
you know, hear anything. So...

01:16:44.367 --> 01:16:46.300
Yeah, that's good.

01:16:46.302 --> 01:16:48.736
Mm-hmm, yeah.

01:16:48.738 --> 01:16:51.005
Yeah, listen, Shay.

01:16:51.007 --> 01:16:52.940
About your dad and I--

01:16:52.942 --> 01:16:55.009
Don't care about that right now.

01:16:55.011 --> 01:16:57.178
Okay.

01:16:57.180 --> 01:16:59.246
But I want you to know...

01:16:59.248 --> 01:17:03.818
that he wanted to tell you a while ago.

01:17:03.820 --> 01:17:06.621
And... for some reason

01:17:06.623 --> 01:17:08.789
I wasn't ready or I...

01:17:08.791 --> 01:17:11.392
I don't know. It was stupid of me.

01:17:11.394 --> 01:17:13.394
And I'm sorry.

01:17:13.396 --> 01:17:16.030
-It.... It's okay. -[Chloe chuckles]

01:17:16.032 --> 01:17:17.665
Hey...

01:17:18.301 --> 01:17:19.800
you know...

01:17:19.802 --> 01:17:22.803
your dad is a great guy.

01:17:22.805 --> 01:17:24.772
And I know we're gonna find him. Okay?

01:17:24.774 --> 01:17:27.842
I'm sure that his car broke down and his phone died or something.

01:17:27.844 --> 01:17:29.310
That's all. Hm.

01:17:29.312 --> 01:17:31.412
Yeah, he's not very good about charging it.

01:17:31.414 --> 01:17:33.147
Yeah. I mean, nobody is.

01:17:33.149 --> 01:17:35.683
I'm sure that's all it is. I'm sure he's fine.

01:17:38.821 --> 01:17:41.889
[intense music]

01:17:55.071 --> 01:17:58.139
[birds chirping]

01:18:11.354 --> 01:18:14.422
[music continues]

01:18:26.969 --> 01:18:30.037
[banging]

01:18:49.292 --> 01:18:50.758
[door shuts]

01:18:58.901 --> 01:19:01.969
[tapping on window]

01:19:13.182 --> 01:19:16.250
[intense music]

01:19:48.217 --> 01:19:51.285
[music continues]

01:19:53.856 --> 01:19:56.924
[birds chirping]

01:20:00.429 --> 01:20:03.497
[intense music]

01:20:26.522 --> 01:20:29.156
-What happened to your eye? -[Sadie chuckles]

01:20:53.549 --> 01:20:55.282
[Derek] Hey, what were you doing yesterday

01:20:55.284 --> 01:20:57.384
driving Shay's dad's car?

01:20:57.386 --> 01:21:00.454
[dramatic music]

01:21:22.345 --> 01:21:23.944
-Hey. -[Derek chuckles]

01:21:23.946 --> 01:21:26.313
Um, would you just lie down,

01:21:26.315 --> 01:21:27.481
just like right there for a sec?

01:21:27.483 --> 01:21:29.383
-Yeah. Yeah. -Yeah? Yeah.

01:21:29.385 --> 01:21:30.651
Okay.

01:21:33.189 --> 01:21:36.156
Now, go on, lie down. I just don't want anyone to see us.

01:21:36.158 --> 01:21:37.424
You know?

01:21:44.133 --> 01:21:47.468
[chuckles] I'm nervous.

01:21:47.470 --> 01:21:49.470
[cracks knuckles]

01:21:49.472 --> 01:21:52.539
[music continues]

01:21:55.311 --> 01:21:57.011
[sighs]

01:21:58.648 --> 01:22:00.915
[birds chirping]

01:22:02.952 --> 01:22:05.219
-[sighs] You're really cute. -[chuckles]

01:22:05.221 --> 01:22:07.121
You're so cute.

01:22:07.123 --> 01:22:10.190
[music continues]

01:22:14.063 --> 01:22:16.096
-[breathing heavily] -Are you nervous?

01:22:16.098 --> 01:22:17.398
[Derek] No...

01:22:20.937 --> 01:22:24.004
[intense music]

01:22:34.684 --> 01:22:35.983
[groans]

01:22:40.189 --> 01:22:42.489
[choking]

01:22:42.491 --> 01:22:44.959
Uh! Oh, fuck! Fuck!

01:22:44.961 --> 01:22:46.060
Oh, my God!

01:22:46.062 --> 01:22:47.962
[gasps] Oh, fuck!

01:22:48.664 --> 01:22:50.230
[Derek groans]

01:22:50.232 --> 01:22:52.399
[screams]

01:22:53.502 --> 01:22:55.035
Nicole?

01:22:56.372 --> 01:22:59.573
You killed him? What did you do?

01:23:01.243 --> 01:23:04.578
Nicky?

01:23:04.580 --> 01:23:06.747
-What did you... -[Chloe] Nicole?

01:23:06.749 --> 01:23:10.384
-Mom! -Chloe!

01:23:10.386 --> 01:23:13.287
[Sadie] Chloe, she killed him! [Nicole] Mom!

01:23:13.289 --> 01:23:15.189
Oh, oh, shit! Oh, my God.

01:23:15.191 --> 01:23:18.158
Oh, my God! What the f...

01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:21.028
[gasping] Oh! Oh! Oh!

01:23:21.030 --> 01:23:23.564
Oh! Oh, my God!

01:23:23.566 --> 01:23:27.334
[Sadie] Chloe, help! She's gonna kill me!

01:23:27.336 --> 01:23:29.269
[Young Nicole screaming]

01:23:29.271 --> 01:23:33.607
[Sadie] Help her! She went crazy! Help!

01:23:33.609 --> 01:23:37.211
Help! Help! Please help!

01:23:37.213 --> 01:23:38.679
[screaming]

01:23:38.681 --> 01:23:41.482
[engine revving]

01:23:41.484 --> 01:23:43.117
[Young Nicole laughing]

01:23:43.119 --> 01:23:46.420
[screaming] Help! Help!

01:23:46.422 --> 01:23:48.055
[breathing heavily]

01:23:51.260 --> 01:23:53.227
[breathing heavily]

01:23:53.229 --> 01:23:54.561
[Sadie grunting]

01:23:54.563 --> 01:23:57.064
[engine revving]

01:23:57.066 --> 01:23:58.465
[Sadie screaming]

01:24:01.037 --> 01:24:02.503
-[Sadie grunting] -[Chloe] Nicole!

01:24:02.505 --> 01:24:05.572
-Stop, Nicky! Stop! -[both grunting]

01:24:05.574 --> 01:24:08.342
Please! Chloe!

01:24:08.344 --> 01:24:10.310
[Sadie panting]

01:24:13.215 --> 01:24:16.583
Wait! Wait! Wait, you have to help!

01:24:16.585 --> 01:24:18.719
She's trying to kill him! She-she's trying to...

01:24:18.721 --> 01:24:22.256
Can you please call the police? Please call the police!

01:24:22.258 --> 01:24:24.291
-Call the police! Please! -[Chloe] What did you do?

01:24:24.293 --> 01:24:25.526
Please!

01:24:35.704 --> 01:24:38.772
[mellow music]

01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:50.117
[sobbing] This is a joke.

01:24:50.119 --> 01:24:51.285
[Wolf] Why did you pick up the knife?

01:24:51.287 --> 01:24:53.187
So she wouldn't stab me with it.

01:24:53.189 --> 01:24:55.622
-What would you have done? -What made you hit your aunt?

01:24:55.624 --> 01:24:59.326
I already told you. I didn't hit her.

01:24:59.328 --> 01:25:00.527
[Stankus] Your mom says you did.

01:25:00.529 --> 01:25:02.830
[Nicole] My mom was at work.

01:25:02.832 --> 01:25:05.666
[Wolf] So how did Sadie get a black eye?

01:25:05.668 --> 01:25:07.835
Because it would just be impossible for her

01:25:07.837 --> 01:25:09.703
to give herself a black eye, now, wouldn't it?

01:25:09.705 --> 01:25:11.338
You think she gave it to herself?

01:25:11.340 --> 01:25:13.340
Yes. Or...

01:25:13.342 --> 01:25:16.477
Or Alex clocked her when she killed him.

01:25:16.479 --> 01:25:19.113
[Wolf] Then she, what, planted your locket on him?

01:25:19.115 --> 01:25:22.683
You really think I would be that stupid?

01:25:22.685 --> 01:25:24.885
[Wolf] Oh, so you're saying you'd be smarter?

01:25:24.887 --> 01:25:26.420
-If you murdered someone. -Yes.

01:25:26.422 --> 01:25:28.322
Your friend, Shay, says you shoved Alex

01:25:28.324 --> 01:25:30.324
pretty hard yesterday mornin',

01:25:30.326 --> 01:25:32.192
shortly before he was murdered.

01:25:32.194 --> 01:25:33.560
Did Sadie orchestrate that, too?

01:25:33.562 --> 01:25:35.629
[Wolf] Or the girl you hit at school?

01:25:37.766 --> 01:25:40.701
[Wolf] You have quite the temper, don't you, Nicole?

01:25:46.642 --> 01:25:48.742
[Nicole on recorder] Sadie. [chuckles]

01:25:48.744 --> 01:25:51.445
A little black eye?

01:25:51.447 --> 01:25:53.747
I could do much worse than that.

01:25:53.749 --> 01:25:55.816
[Sadie on recorder] Don't, Nicky. You're scaring me.

01:25:55.818 --> 01:25:58.418
[Nicole on recorder] You should be scared.

01:25:58.420 --> 01:26:02.489
If you don't leave me and my mom alone,

01:26:02.491 --> 01:26:04.358
I really will hurt you.

01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:06.360
[Sadie on recorder] I know you don't mean that.

01:26:06.362 --> 01:26:09.763
You're just confused. Ow!

01:26:13.335 --> 01:26:16.270
[Wolf] Okay, let's go through this again.

01:26:16.272 --> 01:26:17.905
And this time, try the truth.

01:26:35.591 --> 01:26:38.659
[intense music]

01:26:59.682 --> 01:27:01.615
[Wolf] You're not exactly the definition

01:27:01.617 --> 01:27:03.884
of a master criminal, are you, Sadie?

01:27:03.886 --> 01:27:05.919
A neighbor saw you and Derek

01:27:05.921 --> 01:27:07.754
walking into the woods holding hands this morning.

01:27:07.756 --> 01:27:10.424
Is my mom coming soon?

01:27:10.426 --> 01:27:12.893
[Stankus] Isn't your mother dead, Sadie?

01:27:12.895 --> 01:27:15.596
I'm not crazy. I don't mean...

01:27:16.932 --> 01:27:19.700
I mean my big sister. She's like my mom.

01:27:19.702 --> 01:27:21.702
I call her mom.

01:27:23.372 --> 01:27:25.839
She takes care of me. She's always taking care of me.

01:27:25.841 --> 01:27:27.274
[Stankus] You wanna tell us why we found

01:27:27.276 --> 01:27:29.910
strands of your hair in Alex's car?

01:27:29.912 --> 01:27:32.946
Is she coming? She's coming, right?

01:27:32.948 --> 01:27:34.781
[Wolf] Chloe doesn't wanna see you, Sadie.

01:27:34.783 --> 01:27:37.317
She's with her daughter.

01:27:37.319 --> 01:27:40.020
-But that's impossible. -[Wolf] Why is that impossible?

01:27:40.022 --> 01:27:41.922
Because...

01:27:41.924 --> 01:27:45.592
Because Nicky's been dead for, like, ten years.

01:27:45.594 --> 01:27:47.527
[Wolf] Dead? [Stankus] How did she die?

01:27:47.529 --> 01:27:50.397
She got hit by a car when she was, like, seven.

01:27:50.399 --> 01:27:52.332
-[Wolf] Sadie... -[sighs]

01:27:52.334 --> 01:27:54.534
[Wolf] A forensic psychiatrist will be able to tell us

01:27:54.536 --> 01:27:56.003
if you really believe that.

01:27:56.005 --> 01:27:57.604
I tried to help, I tried to,

01:27:57.606 --> 01:27:58.972
like, stop it from happening.

01:27:58.974 --> 01:28:01.708
I tried to save her, and I couldn't. Like--

01:28:01.710 --> 01:28:05.612
[Wolf] We know that isn't true. Just level with us.

01:28:05.614 --> 01:28:09.016
-Why did you do all this? -Chloe was so sad after that.

01:28:09.018 --> 01:28:11.718
But, like, I made her feel better.

01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:14.588
I helped her.

01:28:14.590 --> 01:28:16.757
[Wolf] All right. She's fuckin' fruit loops.

01:28:16.759 --> 01:28:17.924
Let's get the psych boys in here.
