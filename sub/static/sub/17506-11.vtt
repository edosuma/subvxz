WEBVTT

00:01.675 --> 00:03.078
- Oh.
- Oh, jeez!

00:04.040 --> 00:06.201
- Ay yi yi.
- Wow.

00:06.326 --> 00:08.553
Gene and Terry have really
outdone themselves this year.

00:08.678 --> 00:10.218
I mean, it's so tacky.
Right, honey?

00:11.552 --> 00:12.471
Oh, boy.
Here they come.

00:12.637 --> 00:16.224
Welcome to our winter
wonderland, Brinkley family!

00:16.390 --> 00:18.602
Yeah, look at your Christmas... house.

00:18.768 --> 00:20.771
Oh, it sure is... A lot.

00:20.937 --> 00:22.522
Amy sure seems to love it!

00:22.688 --> 00:24.566
Oh, yeah, well,
you can't really go by her,

00:24.732 --> 00:25.670
'cause she's easily impressed.

00:25.795 --> 00:26.905
Yeah, she's not a great barometer.

00:27.030 --> 00:29.404
She... she'll play
with my shoe for an hour.

00:29.570 --> 00:31.276
Oh, well, remember, we're
gonna come by with the kids

00:31.401 --> 00:33.075
to sing Carols in a few days!

00:33.241 --> 00:35.246
<i># bum ba ba bum, bum ba ba bum #</i>

00:35.371 --> 00:36.787
# bum ba ba bum, bum ba ba bum #

00:36.953 --> 00:38.789
Oh, you're the high part?

00:38.955 --> 00:39.984
# hark! How the bells
sweet silver bells #

00:40.109 --> 00:41.249
We should get going.

00:41.415 --> 00:42.417
# All seem to say throw cares away #

00:42.583 --> 00:44.589
# Oh, my God it has words #

00:44.714 --> 00:46.701
# What do we do?
Just back away #

00:46.826 --> 00:49.299
# I'm really scared right now #

Hey.
Hey, babba-Lou.

01:12.325 --> 01:13.824
Oh, my God!
Little Christmas tree!

01:13.990 --> 01:16.955
I'm not really loving the
little Christmas tree this year.

01:17.080 --> 01:18.203
I mean, look at it.

01:18.681 --> 01:20.497
And Amy's not so into it, either.

01:20.663 --> 01:21.960
Is this 'cause of gene
and Terry's decorations?

01:22.085 --> 01:24.918
Because, babe, seriously,
their house is bonkers.

01:25.084 --> 01:26.381
Okay, but you have to admit it.

01:26.506 --> 01:28.066
I mean, she loved it.

01:28.191 --> 01:30.101
And... and, you know,
isn't it our mission in life

01:30.226 --> 01:32.771
to make sure that her eyes
light up like that?

01:32.896 --> 01:35.006
Babe, we make her eyes
light up aplenty.

01:35.131 --> 01:36.096
Right, Ame?

01:36.262 --> 01:37.842
Come on, who's got the wiggly-walk?

01:37.967 --> 01:42.227
Who's got that wiggly-walk?
It's so wiggly, so... Wiggly.

01:42.393 --> 01:44.813
- There was a glimpse of something there.
- Yeah.

01:44.979 --> 01:47.936
It really is going to be
the ultimate ski-sno-vacation.

01:48.061 --> 01:50.694
Wow. You are aware of the fact
that you don't ski?

01:50.860 --> 01:53.324
And every time I fall, Kevin
will be there to pick me up

01:53.449 --> 01:57.278
in his big, strong arms
and carry me to a bearskin rug

01:57.403 --> 01:59.864
by a roaring fire,
where the steam from our bodies

01:59.989 --> 02:01.740
will cause a freaky thaw.

02:02.288 --> 02:04.124
Special delivery from the North Pole.

02:04.290 --> 02:05.208
Hi!

02:05.374 --> 02:06.251
Hey, hey.

02:06.417 --> 02:07.836
Mwah.
What are you guys doing here?

02:08.002 --> 02:09.791
Well, we thought we'd come
and cute this place up a little.

02:09.916 --> 02:11.008
Well, you have.

02:11.134 --> 02:12.210
Also, somebody's got a stinky diaper.

02:12.335 --> 02:13.925
- If you don't mind.
- No, not at all.

02:14.091 --> 02:15.180
All right.
Be right back.

02:15.305 --> 02:16.636
- Okay.
- You are stinky.

02:16.802 --> 02:17.882
And, um, do you have a quick second?

02:18.007 --> 02:19.014
I'd like to talk you in your office.

02:19.180 --> 02:21.808
Christopher!
What will people say?

02:21.974 --> 02:23.560
I need your help.

02:23.726 --> 02:26.062
I'm having trouble coming up
with a gift for Reagan.

02:26.228 --> 02:28.643
Oh, you know, she was coveting
that tennis bracelet I wore

02:28.768 --> 02:29.900
to the creative arts Emmys.

02:30.066 --> 02:31.193
They're kind of expensive, you know?

02:31.359 --> 02:33.781
Yes, but you always
get something nice for Reagan.

02:33.906 --> 02:37.199
Why not get her a bracelet
encrusted with <i>di-a-monds?</i>

02:37.365 --> 02:38.617
Wait, what are you...?

02:38.783 --> 02:39.821
You know the saying,

02:39.946 --> 02:41.328
<i>"di-a-monds</i> are
a girl's best friend."

02:41.494 --> 02:42.907
Oh, dia... okay, yeah.

02:43.032 --> 02:44.576
Well, yes, I mean, nice jewelry

02:44.701 --> 02:46.578
was always kind of my go-to
when I was working all the time,

02:46.703 --> 02:48.168
but I haven't worked
in almost a year, so...

02:48.334 --> 02:50.481
Well, Reagan has.
She's been doing quite well.

02:50.606 --> 02:52.550
Did you know
that she makes 70% of what

02:52.675 --> 02:54.716
the male executive producer
<i>the Ellen show</i> makes?

02:54.882 --> 02:56.487
I don't know, I just
don't want to use <i>her</i> money

02:56.612 --> 02:57.805
to buy her own gift.

02:57.930 --> 02:59.657
I want to be able to...

02:59.782 --> 03:01.890
Do something special for her
on my own, you know?

03:02.056 --> 03:04.062
You are like a...

03:04.187 --> 03:07.265
A sweet, sweet onion.

03:07.390 --> 03:09.314
So many layers.

03:09.480 --> 03:10.935
Now, you need to go,
I'm about to try on

03:11.060 --> 03:12.400
- some ski bunny outfits.
- Okay.

03:12.566 --> 03:14.022
- Thanks, Ava.
- Check this out.

03:14.147 --> 03:15.974
Eat our heart out,
ski-pro-turned-pitchwoman

03:16.099 --> 03:17.659
Susie Chapstick.

03:17.784 --> 03:19.244
Chhh. Chhh.

03:19.369 --> 03:21.117
Powder.

03:24.607 --> 03:26.748
Welcome ho-ho-home!

03:26.914 --> 03:27.624
Hey. Wow.

03:27.790 --> 03:29.251
I know.
I'm kicking ass, right?

03:29.417 --> 03:31.155
Yeah, my mom's
gonna drive down tomorrow,

03:31.280 --> 03:33.324
so I just thought I'd get it all
done before she got here.

03:33.449 --> 03:34.659
Oh! Oh, my God!
Look at this!

03:34.784 --> 03:37.095
Look at this!
You're not gonna believe it!

03:37.220 --> 03:38.802
I flocked these pinecones myself.

03:38.968 --> 03:40.762
God.
Did you do all this...

03:40.928 --> 03:41.799
Also, what does this smell like?

03:41.924 --> 03:43.134
What does this smell like?

03:43.259 --> 03:44.569
- Waxy cinnamon?
- Christmas.

03:44.694 --> 03:46.601
It smells like Christmas.

03:46.767 --> 03:48.573
- Oh.
- The best part?

03:48.698 --> 03:49.674
Look at Amy.

03:49.799 --> 03:50.856
I mean, you know, she's not, like,

03:51.022 --> 03:53.010
fully lighting up right now,
but she's...

03:53.135 --> 03:54.734
I mean, she is digging it.
She's digging it quietly.

03:54.900 --> 03:57.237
- On the inside, quietly.
- Right.

03:57.403 --> 03:59.573
- And I'm not even halfway done.
- Oh, really?

03:59.739 --> 04:00.868
No, you know what I wanna track down?

04:00.993 --> 04:02.353
I wanna track down one of those, uh...

04:02.478 --> 04:04.355
Those light-up Santa Claus
with the reindeer

04:04.480 --> 04:05.623
to put up on the roof.

04:05.748 --> 04:07.392
You know, like, those old
vintagey-looking ones

04:07.517 --> 04:08.960
where Santa's got his arm up

04:09.085 --> 04:10.528
and he's making that "ho ho ho" face?

04:10.653 --> 04:11.596
- Right.
- You know, like this?

04:11.721 --> 04:13.211
Ho ho.

04:13.377 --> 04:14.415
No, I... no, I got it.

04:14.540 --> 04:15.750
- That one.
- Yeah.

04:15.875 --> 04:17.250
By the way, we're not
going crazy with each other

04:17.375 --> 04:18.720
for gifts this year, right?

04:18.845 --> 04:20.760
Oh, I don't know, I just...

04:20.926 --> 04:24.008
I just feel like this should
really just be about Amy.

04:24.133 --> 04:27.095
And, honestly, your gift to me
is the fact that you are

04:27.220 --> 04:29.144
just an amazing husband and father.

04:29.310 --> 04:31.104
Thanks, babe.

04:35.895 --> 04:38.486
Your mommy is the best, huh?

04:40.821 --> 04:43.294
I agree, she deserves a bracelet.

04:43.419 --> 04:45.396
Made out of...

04:45.521 --> 04:46.828
<i>Di-a-monds.</i>

04:46.994 --> 04:50.081
So listen, uh,
I was talking to my ex-wife.

04:50.247 --> 04:52.370
Oh, that's great.
It really is important

04:52.495 --> 04:54.806
to keep the lines
of communication open.

04:54.931 --> 04:56.796
- Chapstick anyone?
- Sure.

04:57.300 --> 05:01.179
No, let's do it this way.

05:01.304 --> 05:03.470
- Mmm, regular flavor.
- Mm-hmm.

05:03.636 --> 05:05.750
Anyway, Ava, uh,
this is the first Christmas

05:05.875 --> 05:08.343
since my divorce,
and Claire and I, we want to

05:08.891 --> 05:13.424
show our daughter that we'll
always be in her life, so...

05:13.549 --> 05:16.194
We're gonna spend Christmas
together at my house.

05:16.319 --> 05:18.396
I mean, look, I-I know
you had this great

05:18.521 --> 05:20.320
ski-sno-vacation planned, but...

05:20.486 --> 05:22.500
- I'm fine.
- Really?

05:22.625 --> 05:23.823
- Yes.
- Okay, good.

05:23.989 --> 05:27.789
I've been dying
to strap on my skis and grab

05:27.914 --> 05:31.542
those two pole thingies,
and swish-swish-swish

05:31.667 --> 05:33.110
down an alpine crevasse.

05:33.235 --> 05:36.252
Thanks, Ava. Thank you
for being so understanding.

05:36.418 --> 05:38.924
I think I need more Chapstick.

05:42.678 --> 05:44.212
Bye now.

05:53.689 --> 05:55.133
I'm burning up!

05:55.258 --> 05:56.534
Missy!

05:56.659 --> 06:00.568
Come cut me out
of this [Bleep]ing thing!

06:00.734 --> 06:02.570
- Quit panicking!
- Ahh!

06:02.736 --> 06:04.108
What's happening?

06:04.233 --> 06:05.907
- You're making it worse!
- Cut it!

06:06.073 --> 06:09.744
I feel like I'm being raped
by a sleeping bag! Ahh!

06:14.973 --> 06:16.835
Ah, got another tweet from Ava.

06:17.001 --> 06:18.919
- Hmm.
- "Skiing in Utah, y'all.

06:19.044 --> 06:22.756
Get a job, snowboarders.
Hashtag, Mormons are cool."

06:22.881 --> 06:24.676
Poor baby girl.
There all by herself.

06:24.842 --> 06:25.643
Yeah.

06:25.768 --> 06:27.161
- Hello?
- Oh, hey, mom!

06:27.286 --> 06:29.472
- Merry Christmas, sweetheart.
- Merry Christmas!

06:29.638 --> 06:32.633
You know, with...
with all the decorations... mwah...

06:32.758 --> 06:35.186
Outside, I wasn't sure
I had the right house.

06:35.352 --> 06:37.171
Yeah, well, I mean,
I know that this isn't what

06:37.296 --> 06:40.708
my super-intellectual parents
would do at their house,

06:40.833 --> 06:42.944
but we're just starting
a new tradition now for Amy.

06:43.110 --> 06:44.511
Chris, what are we gonna do

06:44.636 --> 06:46.906
with our beautiful little
obsessive-compulsive?

06:47.072 --> 06:49.883
Oh, well, this ADHD boy

06:50.008 --> 06:51.885
is not gonna touch that
with a ten-foot pole, so...

06:52.010 --> 06:53.371
Yeah, I wouldn't.

06:53.537 --> 06:57.792
Is it me, or is this snowman
sexually perverse?

06:57.958 --> 07:00.761
Gyrating like that.
No pants.

07:00.886 --> 07:03.131
I actually think he is amazing.

07:03.297 --> 07:05.366
And, you know what, I'm not
gonna apologize for wanting

07:05.491 --> 07:07.552
to give my daughter a very
special first Christmas, mom.

07:07.718 --> 07:10.138
Oh, goodness.
I'm not asking you to.

07:10.304 --> 07:11.431
Excuse me.

07:11.597 --> 07:14.808
Excuse me.

07:14.933 --> 07:16.061
Okay, all right.

07:16.227 --> 07:17.270
Uh, who would like
some delicious wine?

07:17.436 --> 07:19.203
- I would.
- Okay.

07:19.521 --> 07:21.048
Thank you.

07:21.173 --> 07:22.700
Merry Christmas.

07:22.825 --> 07:24.277
- Whoa, Ava.
- Hey!

07:24.443 --> 07:25.552
Where did you come from?

07:25.677 --> 07:27.621
Oh, I parked around the block
and scaled your wall.

07:27.746 --> 07:28.573
Angie!

07:29.081 --> 07:30.624
I really like that brooch.
Is that vintage?

07:30.749 --> 07:31.709
How are you here?

07:31.834 --> 07:33.495
I mean, you're supposed
to be in Utah.

07:33.661 --> 07:34.995
Well, the jig is up, everyone.

07:35.120 --> 07:36.289
I'm not in Utah!

07:36.455 --> 07:38.875
See, I wanted Kevin
to think that I went skiing.

07:39.041 --> 07:41.852
I wanted him to think
that I was fine with whatever

07:41.977 --> 07:44.964
was going on with his ex in that
sin shack across the street.

07:45.130 --> 07:48.675
Listen to me, there is nothing
going on across the street.

07:48.800 --> 07:49.943
All right? Claire?

07:50.068 --> 07:52.446
Seriously, you have nothing
to worry about with her.

07:52.571 --> 07:53.947
Right, honey?

07:54.072 --> 07:56.183
Oh, no, yeah.
Talk about "woof."

07:56.308 --> 07:58.569
Yeah. I mean,
she is not easy on the eyes.

07:58.694 --> 08:02.156
- I mean, she is mean. Rude.
- Oh, she's a compulsive liar.

08:02.281 --> 08:04.491
- Big ba-donka-donk.
- Yeah, she ran a Ponzi scheme.

08:04.616 --> 08:05.777
- I'm pretty sure.
- Just unpleasant. Bad breath.

08:05.943 --> 08:08.228
Aww, you guys are the best.

08:08.353 --> 08:11.215
- I'll just take this.
- Take that.

08:11.340 --> 08:12.492
Oh, my God!

08:12.658 --> 08:14.369
Is that her pulling up
to Kevin's house?

08:14.535 --> 08:15.669
Oh, look at them.

08:15.794 --> 08:17.956
They were out together
rekindling, I knew it.

08:18.122 --> 08:20.924
What is that she's carrying,
a fruit bouquet?

08:21.049 --> 08:23.544
Oh, nobody likes those.
Good going, Claire.

08:23.669 --> 08:25.338
Hope they like fruit flies
for Christmas.

08:25.504 --> 08:26.447
Ava, they're just trying

08:26.572 --> 08:28.174
to give their daughter
a nice Christmas.

08:28.340 --> 08:30.851
That's how it starts.
But then it's,

08:30.976 --> 08:33.211
"McKenna, remember that time
we all went to the zoo

08:33.595 --> 08:35.289
and you dropped your ice cream?"

08:35.414 --> 08:36.690
And then, the next thing
you know, Kevin and Claire

08:36.815 --> 08:37.808
are making love.

08:38.082 --> 08:40.894
Okay, I hope there are
a bunch of steps in between.

08:41.019 --> 08:43.606
Hey, Ava, why don't you
just go talk to Kevin?

08:43.772 --> 08:45.866
Ugh, because I'm in Utah, Chris?

08:45.991 --> 08:49.603
And, besides, even if I did
somehow "come back," I...

08:49.728 --> 08:52.365
I just can't barge in
on their precious family time.

08:52.531 --> 08:54.675
I mean, how would that look?

08:54.800 --> 08:57.010
Something like this.

08:57.135 --> 09:00.764
Do you guys have any binoculars?

09:00.889 --> 09:02.917
McKenna's playing in the front yard!

09:03.083 --> 09:04.268
By herself!

09:04.393 --> 09:06.753
You do?
Oh, fantastic!

09:06.878 --> 09:08.173
Yeah, will you put it on hold for me?

09:08.339 --> 09:09.623
Yeah, I'll be right there.
I'll be right there.

09:09.748 --> 09:11.634
Oh, my God!
I am the awesomest!

09:11.800 --> 09:14.945
I found a place that has the
last Santa display for the roof.

09:15.070 --> 09:16.630
- That's great!
- Oh, my God, do you remember?

09:16.755 --> 09:17.948
When I was a kid, and our neighbors

09:18.073 --> 09:19.283
had that one on the roof?

09:19.408 --> 09:21.728
God, I used to stare
at that for <i>hours.</i>

09:21.894 --> 09:23.904
Uch, the Tardinos.
Oh, yeah.

09:24.029 --> 09:26.773
Well, they're still there,
depressing property values

09:26.898 --> 09:29.442
with their trampoline
full of pine needles.

09:29.567 --> 09:30.820
You know they bought a boat?

09:30.986 --> 09:32.796
Well, it was a beautiful Santa.

09:32.921 --> 09:34.073
I loved it.

09:35.699 --> 09:38.118
There's smoke coming out
of Kevin's chimney.

09:38.243 --> 09:39.636
Don't panic!

09:39.761 --> 09:41.588
We don't know for sure
that they've made that fire

09:41.713 --> 09:43.590
for romantic purposes.

09:43.715 --> 09:44.842
I'm just gonna
take this cookie and dip it

09:44.967 --> 09:47.170
in this port wine cheese ball.

09:48.879 --> 09:50.797
What do you mean
you sold the frickin' Santa?

09:50.922 --> 09:52.050
I had it on hold!

09:52.216 --> 09:54.034
Yeah, but then what happened was

09:54.159 --> 09:56.763
somebody else came in, so, yeah...

09:56.929 --> 10:00.007
Great. Just great.
Well, thank you.

10:00.132 --> 10:01.992
Thank you very much
for ruining Christmas.

10:02.117 --> 10:04.494
- Are you happy?
- I'm wearing antlers,

10:04.619 --> 10:07.497
and working in a holiday theme
store on Christmas Eve.

10:07.622 --> 10:10.735
- Of course I'm not happy.
- Okay, you know what, Roger?

10:10.901 --> 10:14.538
I need my little girl
to light up tonight, okay?

10:14.663 --> 10:19.244
So you need to produce
a Santa... with reindeer...

10:19.410 --> 10:21.579
or else that chicken nugget...

10:21.745 --> 10:25.583
Is not gonna enter
your body via your mouth.

10:28.419 --> 10:31.089
Ooh!
That's lovely!

10:31.255 --> 10:33.390
Well, you know, I was thinking
about getting it for Reagan,

10:33.515 --> 10:35.677
but I was hoping to find
a last-second sale somewhere.

10:35.843 --> 10:38.179
Oh, Chris, Reagan doesn't care
about things like that.

10:38.345 --> 10:39.679
Okay, well, maybe not, but I do.

10:39.804 --> 10:41.381
I care.

10:41.506 --> 10:43.884
It's what husbands do
when they have great wives.

10:44.009 --> 10:45.979
- They get them great gifts.
- Oh, my God.

10:46.145 --> 10:48.522
What is it about men
always having to

10:48.647 --> 10:50.190
Whip it out?

10:50.315 --> 10:52.192
I mean, look at you,
waving it around,

10:52.317 --> 10:55.862
slamming it down on the table
for everyone to see.

10:55.987 --> 10:57.156
Ga-gush!

10:57.322 --> 10:59.533
Ga-gush?
Oh, I'm sor... is that a...

10:59.658 --> 11:01.534
- that's a penis sound?
- Look, Chris.

11:01.659 --> 11:05.539
You made a choice to give up
your job and stay home with Amy.

11:05.664 --> 11:07.975
I was so proud of you.

11:08.100 --> 11:09.810
I-I didn't think you had it in you.

11:09.935 --> 11:11.645
Sorry, but, uh...

11:11.770 --> 11:15.675
I always thought you were just
a little bit of a... Macho yahoo.

11:15.841 --> 11:17.584
Oh, you did?
Oh, well.

11:17.709 --> 11:20.513
I've been in my fair share of fights.

11:20.679 --> 11:24.324
That's a strong choice
that you made, not a weak one.

11:24.449 --> 11:27.494
So what if you don't
bring home the bacon anymore?

11:27.619 --> 11:31.316
You are a real man.
Ga-gush!

11:31.482 --> 11:35.118
- Thank you, Angie.
- I mean it.

11:35.243 --> 11:39.263
Okay.
Good guy.

11:43.285 --> 11:45.413
I gotta get me some cash.

11:49.041 --> 11:50.793
Good-bye, Shanny.

11:50.959 --> 11:53.671
Hey, Chris.
What's going on?

11:53.837 --> 11:56.049
Uh, I'm just gonna go sell
some of my hockey stuff.

11:56.215 --> 12:01.061
Wow, I guess we're both making
sacrifices this holiday season.

12:01.186 --> 12:03.765
Oh, boy.

12:03.931 --> 12:07.734
Okay, uh, did you want to talk
about your sacrifices?

12:07.859 --> 12:09.771
Oh, Christopher,
you are so intuitive.

12:09.937 --> 12:12.072
I mean, I'm not really upset
about his ex-wife being there,

12:12.197 --> 12:13.740
even though she
is an obsessed man-eater

12:13.865 --> 12:15.068
who does not know when to quit.

12:15.234 --> 12:16.443
- Yeah.
- It's just that I've never

12:16.568 --> 12:22.282
really cared about
a guy this way since...

12:22.407 --> 12:24.035
Since... since ever, I guess.

12:24.201 --> 12:28.121
Ava, I... I guess that's...

12:28.246 --> 12:32.460
That's just this, uh, this
love... Stuff, right?

12:32.626 --> 12:34.895
Wow.

12:35.020 --> 12:36.730
You always know what to say, Chris.

12:36.855 --> 12:38.132
Oh.

12:38.298 --> 12:41.135
I could really use a hug.

12:41.301 --> 12:42.804
Sure.
Yeah, of course.

12:42.970 --> 12:44.680
Ah, okay.

12:44.846 --> 12:47.183
That is so, so nice.

12:47.349 --> 12:49.409
Wow, this is...

12:49.534 --> 12:51.104
- Ava.
- What?

12:51.270 --> 12:52.939
That's not mine!

12:53.105 --> 12:55.248
- Look, I'm not...
- I was just goosing you.

12:55.373 --> 12:57.250
I'm not taking your money, okay?

12:57.375 --> 12:58.778
I'm gonna be fine.

12:58.944 --> 13:00.587
Is it... look.
I'm sorry, I gotta go.

13:00.712 --> 13:02.172
- I'm super late.
- What?

13:02.297 --> 13:04.450
I gotta go see
this sports memorabilia guy,

13:04.616 --> 13:05.659
then I gotta go
across town to the mall,

13:05.784 --> 13:07.010
and the mall's
gonna be totally packed,

13:07.135 --> 13:09.122
and I'm terrible in jam-packed
shopping situations.

13:09.288 --> 13:12.423
Christopher,
do you need me to slap you?

13:14.426 --> 13:16.587
You didn't even let me answer.

13:16.753 --> 13:19.689
I mean, really, what good
is putting something on hold

13:19.814 --> 13:21.342
if they're not gonna hold it?

13:21.508 --> 13:23.810
The holidays are so frustrating.

13:23.935 --> 13:25.845
That's why, every year,
I pay a Southern gay

13:25.970 --> 13:27.140
to decorate my house.

13:27.306 --> 13:28.915
It's just a needless decoration!

13:29.040 --> 13:30.935
A plastic Santa's not that important.

13:31.101 --> 13:33.604
Yes, a plastic Santa
is very important, mom.

13:33.770 --> 13:36.180
The only thing that matters
to me right now is to see

13:36.607 --> 13:37.758
my baby's face light up.

13:37.883 --> 13:40.445
God, you're just...
you are such a Grinch.

13:40.611 --> 13:43.430
Well, I-I don't know
this "Grinch" you speak of.

13:43.555 --> 13:45.283
What, is that a Dickensian character?

13:45.449 --> 13:47.434
Oh, please, don't pretend
that you don't know

13:47.559 --> 13:49.454
who the Grinch is.
God.

13:49.620 --> 13:52.540
You just don't get it.

13:52.706 --> 13:56.210
No, I think I do.

14:03.558 --> 14:06.937
Sweet mother.

14:07.062 --> 14:08.812
God...

14:11.838 --> 14:13.436
- Oh-oh.
- Mom, great!

14:13.602 --> 14:14.812
Where have you been?

14:14.978 --> 14:16.472
What's all this?

14:16.597 --> 14:18.399
Grab an antler!
Or a hoof!

14:18.565 --> 14:20.693
- Come on!
- Where did you find this?

14:20.818 --> 14:23.095
- Our neighbors' roof.
- What?

14:23.220 --> 14:24.530
This...

14:24.655 --> 14:26.616
This is the stuff
from when I was a kid?

14:26.782 --> 14:29.018
I raced to Santa Barbara
to beg the Tardinos

14:29.143 --> 14:30.436
to loan it to us.

14:30.561 --> 14:32.671
I was dreading asking them,
because I don't relish

14:32.796 --> 14:35.140
coming face to face
with Rick Tardino's

14:35.265 --> 14:37.168
swirling chest carpet.

14:37.334 --> 14:41.130
Anyway, they weren't home.
So... I borrowed it.

14:41.296 --> 14:44.910
- You stole for me?
- No...

14:45.035 --> 14:47.106
Borrowed.

14:47.231 --> 14:49.067
Although, I think
they were at church.

14:49.192 --> 14:50.874
Yeah, I don't feel
so great about that,

14:50.999 --> 14:52.767
but I made my peace with it.

14:52.933 --> 14:55.353
Thank you, mom.
Thank you.

14:55.519 --> 14:57.780
You're not the only mommy who
wants to give her little girl

14:57.905 --> 14:58.898
a great Christmas.

14:59.064 --> 15:00.183
Maybe we should wait for Chris then,

15:00.308 --> 15:01.776
to get all this stuff
up on the roof, huh?

15:01.942 --> 15:03.987
Yeah, or I could,
uh, I could limber up

15:04.112 --> 15:07.406
with some clear spirits,
and you could grab a ladder.

15:07.572 --> 15:09.726
Ohh.
Give it up, mom.

15:09.851 --> 15:11.869
It's Christmas up in here!
Let's do it!

15:14.972 --> 15:16.849
Would you like to try
incognito for men, by Devon?

15:16.974 --> 15:19.569
No, thanks... oh, God, ah!

15:19.694 --> 15:21.804
Thank you, smells really good.
Kinda burns...

15:21.929 --> 15:23.072
- ow!
- I'm so sorry.

15:23.197 --> 15:25.408
- What's wrong with you?
- So much. Everything.

15:25.533 --> 15:27.860
Oh, gosh!
Merry Christmas!

15:27.985 --> 15:29.862
Jeez. Excuse me, ma'am,
I'm just trying to find...

15:29.987 --> 15:31.814
Excuse me!
She's already helping me.

15:31.939 --> 15:33.849
I'm sorry, I did not see you there.

15:34.015 --> 15:34.918
- God!
- I'm just trying to find

15:35.043 --> 15:36.085
- something for my...
- Lotion!

15:36.210 --> 15:38.321
No, no!
Sorry, I didn't mean to do that.

15:38.446 --> 15:39.505
Just a little bit nervous right now.

15:39.630 --> 15:42.842
A lot of stuff's going on in my...

15:42.967 --> 15:45.778
Bra... celet.

15:47.404 --> 15:49.740
Hey...

15:51.625 --> 15:52.577
No, no.

15:52.743 --> 15:54.745
No! No!

15:54.911 --> 15:57.814
Oh, come on.

16:04.838 --> 16:07.533
Get this reindeer's bottom
out of my face.

16:07.658 --> 16:09.235
Well, you gotta
hold the ladder steady.

16:09.360 --> 16:12.021
Pl... okay, mom, put down the wine.

16:12.146 --> 16:13.222
Put down the wine.

16:13.388 --> 16:15.291
Have you never been
on a ladder before?

16:15.416 --> 16:17.076
You know what?
Now you're shaking it, mom.

16:17.201 --> 16:18.378
You're shaking.
Okay, will you just...

16:18.503 --> 16:20.396
At least will you
take off your pumps, please?

16:20.562 --> 16:22.698
You don't decorate barefoot.

16:22.823 --> 16:25.034
We're not the Tardinos,
for God's sake.

16:25.159 --> 16:26.536
Okay, you know what?
I can't hold it anymore.

16:26.661 --> 16:27.704
It's slipping out of my hand.
It's slipping!

16:27.829 --> 16:29.372
I got it!
I got it! I got it!

16:29.497 --> 16:30.940
I got it!

16:31.065 --> 16:31.866
Oh.

16:32.333 --> 16:34.243
Why did you say you got it?

16:34.409 --> 16:35.328
I don't know.

16:35.494 --> 16:38.080
- Oh, Reagan!
- What?

16:38.246 --> 16:39.665
Can you see into
Kevin's backyard from there?

16:39.831 --> 16:41.417
I think there's steam
coming out of his jacuzzi.

16:41.583 --> 16:43.269
That's a sexual gateway.

16:43.394 --> 16:44.937
Ava, honey, if you're
so worried about what Kevin

16:45.062 --> 16:46.939
is doing, why don't you
just go over there

16:47.064 --> 16:49.342
and talk to him about it
like an adult?

16:49.508 --> 16:52.061
You're right.

16:54.071 --> 16:56.932
Or I could spy from the neighbors'.

16:58.326 --> 17:00.703
Surprise!
Hi, it's me!

17:00.828 --> 17:01.788
Ava Alexander!

17:01.913 --> 17:05.174
And this is, um...
A holiday home makeover!

17:05.299 --> 17:06.409
- Wait, what?
- Oh, my God!

17:06.534 --> 17:08.077
- Yep!
- Ava Alexander!

17:08.202 --> 17:10.913
That's right!
Dreams are coming true, kids!

17:11.038 --> 17:12.964
Uh, from which one of your
windows can I most clearly

17:13.089 --> 17:14.183
view your neighbor's backyard?

17:14.308 --> 17:15.751
I can't believe this is happening!

17:15.876 --> 17:17.020
It is!
It totally is!

17:17.145 --> 17:19.521
- Keep on watching and growing.
- Oh, my God!

17:19.646 --> 17:24.042
That's right.
Kevin doesn't have a jacuzzi.

17:24.209 --> 17:28.422
But you will,
after your home makeover!

17:28.588 --> 17:31.367
Home makeover!

17:31.492 --> 17:32.718
Whoo!

17:32.884 --> 17:34.220
All right, hit it.

17:34.595 --> 17:36.289
There.

17:36.414 --> 17:39.826
- Whoo-hoo!
- Santa's on the roof, y'all!

17:39.951 --> 17:41.734
All right.
All right.

17:42.477 --> 17:43.938
Whoa! Whoa!

17:45.873 --> 17:47.775
Are you okay?

17:47.941 --> 17:49.952
Oh! Oh, what are you
laughing at, huh?

17:50.077 --> 17:52.788
Oh, you think that's funny,
you little scoundrel?

17:52.913 --> 17:54.173
You know what?

17:54.298 --> 17:56.784
I'll give you something
to laugh about.

17:56.950 --> 17:58.160
I'm gonna...

17:58.326 --> 18:00.847
Tickle you!
Tickle you! Tickle you!

18:08.879 --> 18:10.806
False alarm.

18:10.931 --> 18:13.426
Kevin and his ex are not
making love in the hot tub.

18:13.592 --> 18:15.311
Ava?

18:15.436 --> 18:18.314
Kevin. Hi!

18:18.439 --> 18:21.317
I just got back
from Utah this second.

18:21.442 --> 18:23.185
Merry Christmas!

18:23.351 --> 18:25.229
I think we need to talk.

18:28.940 --> 18:31.777
Guess what, daddy's home!

18:31.943 --> 18:33.404
Hi!

18:33.570 --> 18:35.715
Hey, that was, like, an elf
decoration that I hit, right?

18:35.840 --> 18:37.450
Not-not, like,
a little man or anything?

18:37.616 --> 18:39.326
Well, honey, what happened to you?

18:39.492 --> 18:40.503
I'm pretty sure that,
on impact, I heard,

18:40.628 --> 18:42.188
like, a, "oh, no!"

18:42.313 --> 18:44.999
I just... uh, I just had
a really bad mall experience.

18:45.165 --> 18:46.667
Oh, honey.

18:46.833 --> 18:48.419
I just wanted to get you
something really special.

18:48.585 --> 18:51.714
The fact that you went through
whatever you went through is...

18:51.839 --> 18:53.966
It's enough for me.
It's the thought that counts.

18:54.132 --> 18:55.918
Well...

18:56.043 --> 18:57.920
- Then I got you two gifts.
- Hmm?

18:58.045 --> 19:01.090
The thoughtful thing and...

19:01.215 --> 19:03.142
Well, and also, this.

19:03.308 --> 19:04.660
Oh, my God!

19:04.785 --> 19:05.828
Oh, my God!

19:05.953 --> 19:07.163
Look at this!

19:07.288 --> 19:08.498
Look at this!
Look at it!

19:08.623 --> 19:09.832
- Yeah, no, no.
- Look at this!

19:09.957 --> 19:11.067
No, I've seen it.

19:11.192 --> 19:13.219
I wrestled a retired police
officer to get it.

19:13.344 --> 19:15.772
Those dudes can really mess you up.

19:15.897 --> 19:18.591
Oh, my God!
Look at how hot my wrist looks!

19:18.716 --> 19:21.594
Oh, [Bleep] You, everybody!
My husband rocks!

19:21.719 --> 19:24.430
My husband rocks!
Oh, my God!

19:24.555 --> 19:26.749
Merry Christmas, babe.

19:26.915 --> 19:28.709
So, I've been here all day.

19:28.875 --> 19:31.462
Spying on you guys.

19:31.628 --> 19:33.672
A celebrity stalker
who's an actual celebrity.

19:35.116 --> 19:39.195
So were you just looking
at us through binoculars or...

19:39.320 --> 19:41.889
- With night vision.
- Night vision.

19:42.055 --> 19:44.725
I also ate an entire cheese ball.

19:44.891 --> 19:48.145
I ate the whole thing like an apple.

19:48.311 --> 19:50.397
Please say something.

19:54.752 --> 19:57.413
I love you.

19:57.538 --> 19:59.348
Are you just saying that
because you're afraid

19:59.473 --> 20:01.350
I'm about to kidnap you?

20:01.475 --> 20:03.119
No.

20:03.244 --> 20:05.788
Wait, I shouldn't be
worried about that, right?

20:05.913 --> 20:08.833
I love you too.

20:10.125 --> 20:14.797
- For you, my dear.
- Oh.

20:14.963 --> 20:17.617
- Huh.
- Mmm!

20:17.742 --> 20:19.760
- Whoa.
- Mm-hmm.

20:19.926 --> 20:22.429
A puck from the lake placid Olympics.

20:22.595 --> 20:24.841
Yeah, it's from the game
when America beat the crap

20:24.966 --> 20:27.351
out of those godless commie bastards.

20:27.517 --> 20:31.147
Do you believe in miracles?

20:31.272 --> 20:32.465
Yes.

20:32.590 --> 20:34.400
It's for your collection.

20:38.028 --> 20:39.280
Yeah.

20:42.116 --> 20:46.495
If only Shanny was here to see this.

20:46.620 --> 20:49.582
I still don't know who that is.

# We wish you
a merry Christmas #

21:01.518 --> 21:02.961
# We wish you a merry Christmas #

21:03.086 --> 21:04.496
# We wish you a merry Christmas #

21:04.621 --> 21:06.348
# And a happy new year #

21:06.623 --> 21:09.301
How many verses does this song have?

21:09.426 --> 21:11.403
- A lot.
- Yep.

21:11.528 --> 21:12.804
# And a happy new year #

21:12.929 --> 21:14.506
# Now bring us some figgy pudding #

21:14.631 --> 21:16.391
# Now bring us some figgy pudding #

21:18.101 --> 21:19.511
# And bring it right here #

21:19.636 --> 21:21.238
# And we won't go until we get some #

21:21.404 --> 21:23.482
They're not gonna
go until they get some.

21:23.607 --> 21:25.326
I know.
We better go get some.

21:25.492 --> 21:27.186
# So bring it out here #

21:27.311 --> 21:28.987
# We wish you a merry Christmas #

21:29.112 --> 21:31.806
# We wish you a merry Christmas #
