BRIDGET:
You never told me
how Bridget died.

00:13.625 --> 00:14.709
RAY:
She was high on drugs.

00:14.792 --> 00:17.208
She jumped off a roof.

00:17.291 --> 00:18.375
That's really sad.

00:18.458 --> 00:21.375
ARAM:
This place is great,
a good investment.

00:21.458 --> 00:22.500
You got money, right?
LAWYER: This is a check

00:22.583 --> 00:26.583
from the diocese for your
settlement of $1.4 million.

00:26.667 --> 00:28.125
He didn't tell me
he was buying a house.

00:28.208 --> 00:29.792
What, he didn't ask
your permission?

00:29.875 --> 00:31.417
(panting)

00:31.500 --> 00:32.583
No! No! No!

00:32.667 --> 00:35.250
What the fuck?

00:36.458 --> 00:37.709
MICKEY:
What did you do?

00:37.792 --> 00:39.333
Let it burn.

00:39.417 --> 00:40.792
Sully died ten years ago.

00:40.875 --> 00:42.709
RAY:
Just tell him I'm here.

00:42.792 --> 00:44.125
I want you to kill my father.

00:44.208 --> 00:45.792
I can set you up
wherever you want to go.

00:45.875 --> 00:48.125
It's not gonna be cheap.

00:48.208 --> 00:50.417
BRIDGET:
Is that your girlfriend?

00:50.500 --> 00:51.625
TERRY:
Yeah, she is.

00:51.709 --> 00:53.208
What's wrong?

00:53.291 --> 00:54.750
I'm just happy you're here.

00:54.834 --> 00:58.083
Well, good. Don't forget it.

00:58.166 --> 00:59.208
RAY:
Sean fucking Walker?

00:59.291 --> 01:00.709
VAN:
I have evidence

01:00.792 --> 01:03.041
that he shot a girl
in Boston 20 years ago.

01:03.125 --> 01:04.166
And then he frames a working Joe

01:04.250 --> 01:07.000
from an honest family
for the murder.

01:07.083 --> 01:09.083
I buy this story, I own it.

01:09.166 --> 01:12.750
You cannot share
this with anyone.

01:12.834 --> 01:14.625
MARVIN:
She was murdered
in our own house.

01:14.709 --> 01:16.875
Fuck you, man. You knew.

01:16.959 --> 01:18.166
Stay away from him,
you understand me?

01:18.250 --> 01:19.625
MARVIN:
Your dad thinks

01:19.709 --> 01:21.041
I'm gonna be
a bad influence on you.

01:21.125 --> 01:23.625
BRIDGET:
My dad's the bad influence.

01:23.709 --> 01:25.458
I'm not ready.

01:25.542 --> 01:26.625
Pipe me, bitch.

01:26.709 --> 01:27.834
Come on. Do it!
Marvin!

01:27.917 --> 01:29.166
You asshole!

01:29.250 --> 01:30.333
What did he do?

01:30.417 --> 01:31.000
He just got carried away.

01:31.083 --> 01:33.375
I didn't mean to hurt her.

01:33.458 --> 01:35.166
BRIDGET:
He's gonna kill him.

01:35.250 --> 01:36.500
Mom.

01:36.583 --> 01:38.834
Come away from the window.

01:46.041 --> 01:48.583
MAN (over TV):
...pretty proud of yourself.
Now, let's get to it.

01:48.667 --> 01:50.542
You're both ready
to go face-to-face, are you?

01:50.625 --> 01:52.375
WOMAN: Yeah, we sure are, Tom.
BOY: Yes, sir, we're ready.

01:52.458 --> 01:55.250
So, you just gonna leave
me here like a piece of shit?

01:55.333 --> 01:57.625
You got to stay here to
take care of my mother.

01:57.709 --> 01:58.875
Why should I?

01:58.959 --> 02:00.959
Years I been
taking care of her.

02:01.041 --> 02:04.000
Now you got
to take care of me.

02:04.083 --> 02:06.875
54...
I cannot go
through another winter

02:06.959 --> 02:09.083
in Boston, Patrick.

02:09.166 --> 02:10.041
I'm getting arthritis

02:10.125 --> 02:12.750
in both my knees.
See, I missed it now.

02:12.834 --> 02:14.500
Fuck it.
I have been living

02:14.583 --> 02:16.709
like shit for years with you.

02:16.792 --> 02:17.875
Like a mole underground.

02:17.959 --> 02:21.208
Moles don't get their hair done
every freaking week.

02:21.291 --> 02:23.500
Now you're gonna be rich, and
you're not taking me with you?

02:23.583 --> 02:28.542
Well, who takes care
of you like I do?

02:28.625 --> 02:30.083
(TV audience groans)

02:30.166 --> 02:31.875
Who lays out your pills?

02:32.709 --> 02:35.750
Who cooks for you?

02:35.834 --> 02:37.375
Who rubs Bengay

02:37.458 --> 02:38.834
Come on.
on your sore shoulder?

02:38.917 --> 02:41.333
Who makes you hard?

02:41.417 --> 02:42.959
Say it.

02:43.041 --> 02:46.000
Who makes you hard, baby?

02:46.083 --> 02:48.208
You got to say it.

02:48.291 --> 02:50.667
Who makes you hard?

02:50.750 --> 02:51.250
WOMAN:
Uh, China.

02:51.333 --> 02:52.792
TOM:
Right you are.

02:52.875 --> 02:53.959
You do.

02:54.041 --> 02:55.333
You make me hard.

02:55.417 --> 02:57.667
Now, shut up
and blow me already.

02:57.750 --> 02:59.875

What?

05:37.375 --> 05:39.333
I thought we talked about this.

I thought we agreed
that I was gonna

05:41.542 --> 05:43.709
go with you,
and I was gonna pick the place.

05:43.792 --> 05:45.250
Now you're gonna get hepatitis.

05:45.333 --> 05:47.417
No, I'm not.
It never leaves your system.

05:47.500 --> 05:48.542

Oh, Jesus.

05:53.834 --> 05:56.667
(sighs)

06:00.041 --> 06:02.709
You let her do this?

06:02.792 --> 06:05.250
In principle, yeah.

06:05.333 --> 06:06.625
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

06:06.709 --> 06:09.041
It means I told her
she could do it,

06:09.125 --> 06:12.083
but not without me being there,
and I was gonna pick the place.

06:14.709 --> 06:16.750
If she didn't go
with you, who did?

06:16.834 --> 06:18.959
I went by myself.

06:19.041 --> 06:19.959
When?

06:20.041 --> 06:21.000
Yesterday.

06:21.083 --> 06:22.125
What time yesterday?

06:22.208 --> 06:24.083
I skipped my last two classes,

06:24.166 --> 06:25.917
but I'm getting A's
in both of them.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.875
I can't even think how you're
gonna get punished for this.

06:27.959 --> 06:31.542
Why don't you beat her?
I'm not my fucking father.

06:31.625 --> 06:33.959
The therapist said I could
do it, and you agreed, Mom.

06:34.041 --> 06:36.667
Therapist? What therapist?
She said it's a way
for me to reclaim

06:36.750 --> 06:38.542
my body after what happened.
What therapist?

06:38.625 --> 06:40.250
I took her to see someone.
She was sexually abused, Ray.

06:40.333 --> 06:41.500
Oh, fuck.
I wasn't sexually abused.

06:43.500 --> 06:45.458
Are you fucking kidding me?

06:45.542 --> 06:47.291
You let this go on?

06:47.375 --> 06:50.125
I told you I was
gonna decide some things.

06:50.208 --> 06:51.417
I told you that.
Not this.

06:51.500 --> 06:52.750
It's a symbolic gesture, Ray.

06:52.834 --> 06:55.041
You're her father.

06:55.125 --> 06:57.000
It's inappropriate for you
to be involved with this.

06:57.083 --> 06:59.083
What the fuck
are you talking about?

06:59.166 --> 07:02.083
That's exactly why I need
to be involved in this.

07:09.709 --> 07:10.750
Did you kill Marvin?

07:10.834 --> 07:13.333
What?

07:13.417 --> 07:14.834
No.

07:14.917 --> 07:15.500
What did you do to him?

07:15.583 --> 07:17.458
I did what had to be done.

07:17.542 --> 07:19.000
What the fuck does that mean?

07:19.083 --> 07:21.375
You don't talk to me like that.

07:21.458 --> 07:23.583
Take that out now.

07:23.667 --> 07:25.667
We had a deal: no piercings,
no tattoos till you're 18.

07:25.750 --> 07:28.583
You take that out now, or you're
not leaving this house.

07:35.125 --> 07:37.083
(dog barking,
indistinct talking)

07:41.667 --> 07:45.333
Man, I been hanging

07:45.417 --> 07:48.458
Man, that can't be healthy.

07:48.542 --> 07:51.375

Mm-hmm.

08:14.709 --> 08:16.542
Right this way.
Thank you.

08:38.208 --> 08:40.625
(smacks lips)

08:40.709 --> 08:42.750
What are you working on?

08:45.792 --> 08:47.250
It's a treatment.

08:47.333 --> 08:50.792
What they call a treatment
for... for a movie.

08:50.875 --> 08:52.667
Oh, yeah?

08:52.750 --> 08:53.667
What's it about?

08:56.041 --> 08:58.375
My life.

08:58.458 --> 09:00.250
That's it?

09:00.333 --> 09:02.625
You're gonna tease a girl
like that?

09:08.041 --> 09:10.959
I optioned my life rights
to Sean Walker.

09:11.041 --> 09:13.834
Wow.

09:13.917 --> 09:14.166
Really?

09:14.250 --> 09:16.083
Yeah.

09:16.166 --> 09:18.291
Sean and I are...

09:18.375 --> 09:19.750
You know?

09:19.834 --> 09:21.542
I mentioned that my back hurt.

09:21.625 --> 09:23.458
He sent me here today.
Treats me like a brother.

09:23.542 --> 09:25.542
So tell me what it's about.

09:27.375 --> 09:28.709
My life as a criminal.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.875
I got sent away
for something I did not do.

09:35.333 --> 09:37.667
For how long?

09:37.750 --> 09:39.959
20 years.

09:41.208 --> 09:42.959
Gee, that's...

09:43.041 --> 09:44.625
awful.

09:47.583 --> 09:49.667
I write, too.

09:49.750 --> 09:51.834
Oh, yeah? I've been
hearing a lot of that.

09:51.917 --> 09:55.709
Guy who packs up my groceries
is working on something.

09:55.792 --> 09:57.166
Same with the garbage man.

09:57.250 --> 09:58.458
Oh, I really do write.

09:58.542 --> 10:01.166
My husband
was a big producer,

10:01.250 --> 10:05.000
and part of my settlement
was a two-script deal.

10:05.083 --> 10:06.959
Oh. Good for you.

10:08.166 --> 10:09.125
You a Jew?

10:09.208 --> 10:11.083

10:11.166 --> 10:13.709
Mazel tov.

10:23.625 --> 10:26.208

10:26.291 --> 10:29.125
(sighs)
1987.

10:29.208 --> 10:30.583
Do the math.

10:30.667 --> 10:32.375
Never my
subject, Ray.

10:32.458 --> 10:33.542
(chuckling):
Oh, yeah?

10:33.625 --> 10:36.208
Remind me, Bunch.
What was your subject?

10:36.291 --> 10:40.166
26 years.

10:42.375 --> 10:44.041
Come on.

10:44.125 --> 10:45.417

11:03.291 --> 11:05.417

dearest sister.

11:05.500 --> 11:07.041

William Shakespeare.

Sorry. Am I
interrupting something?

11:25.291 --> 11:26.417

birthday.

11:26.500 --> 11:28.333
We do this every year.

11:28.417 --> 11:32.083
Oh, that's really lovely.

11:32.166 --> 11:34.208
It's Bridget, right?
BUNCHY: Uh-huh.

11:34.291 --> 11:35.709
Ray named his kid after her.

11:35.792 --> 11:38.375
Can I talk to you for a minute?

11:38.458 --> 11:40.333
Sure.

11:42.125 --> 11:43.792
I-I can wait.
It's all right.

11:43.875 --> 11:46.208
Come on.

11:53.208 --> 11:55.291
(door opens)

11:58.083 --> 11:59.417
(door closes)

11:59.500 --> 12:00.625
So, what?

12:00.709 --> 12:02.959
You staying here
every night now?

12:03.041 --> 12:05.417
Yeah.

12:05.500 --> 12:08.208
Why'd you light your house
on fire, Bunch?

12:08.291 --> 12:10.959
I don't like it.

12:13.375 --> 12:14.583
Why'd you pull a gun on Pop?

12:16.375 --> 12:18.792
I don't like him.

12:21.667 --> 12:24.667
(both laugh)

12:25.959 --> 12:27.375
Oh, yeah, that's
really gonna help.

12:27.458 --> 12:31.583
Go fuck yourself, Ray.

12:31.667 --> 12:34.166
I thought you were gonna get
my money back for the house.

12:34.250 --> 12:35.375

12:40.834 --> 12:42.166
Your husband?

12:42.250 --> 12:44.166
How the hell did you know
I was married?

12:44.250 --> 12:45.750
Did you follow me?

12:45.834 --> 12:47.291
You lied to me.

12:47.375 --> 12:48.166
And you led me on.

12:48.250 --> 12:50.166
I'm sorry.

12:50.250 --> 12:51.834
I wanted to tell you.

12:52.542 --> 12:56.166
I don't love him.

12:56.250 --> 12:57.000
But I can't leave him

12:57.083 --> 12:59.458
until my kid is
out of the house.

12:59.542 --> 13:00.792
He's 17.

13:00.875 --> 13:02.125
I'm not a side man.

13:02.208 --> 13:02.750
What does that mean?

13:02.834 --> 13:03.959
What does it sound like?

13:06.625 --> 13:09.125
What'd you come here for?

13:11.834 --> 13:13.250
I don't know.

13:15.792 --> 13:19.667
Thanks for the fucking support.

13:27.208 --> 13:28.375
See you.

13:28.458 --> 13:29.917
We doing this or not?

13:36.208 --> 13:38.625
"May the road rise up
to meet you.

13:38.709 --> 13:40.291
"May the wind be
ever at your back.

13:40.375 --> 13:42.583
May..."

13:42.667 --> 13:44.000
(slams shot glass)

13:44.083 --> 13:45.250
You don't hit women.

13:45.333 --> 13:46.625
Oh, come on, Ter, just...

13:46.709 --> 13:49.083
Wait a minute, would you...?

13:49.166 --> 13:51.458
Fuck.

13:55.709 --> 13:58.041
(sniffs)

13:58.375 --> 14:01.083
Bridg?

14:01.166 --> 14:03.417
I made your favorite.

14:03.500 --> 14:05.000
Grilled cheese and tomato soup.

14:10.834 --> 14:13.208
Bridget, I got the tray.

14:29.375 --> 14:31.083
You want to talk about it?

14:31.166 --> 14:32.583
No.

14:32.667 --> 14:33.834
BUNCHY:
Hey.

14:33.917 --> 14:36.750
Remember the last time
we did this?

14:36.834 --> 14:40.583
We beat the crap out of
Charlie Conway and his brothers.

14:40.667 --> 14:44.834
Wasn't he trying to take your
lunch money or something?

14:44.917 --> 14:47.041
It wasn't exactly
my lunch money.

14:47.125 --> 14:49.250
I just said that.

14:49.333 --> 14:53.500
It was money I made selling
coke I stole from Dad.

14:53.583 --> 14:54.500
Jesus.

14:54.583 --> 14:56.709
(quiet laugh)

14:57.792 --> 14:59.834
What the fuck
am I doing?

14:59.917 --> 15:03.583
Remember when
Bridget got suspended?

15:03.667 --> 15:05.083
Which time?

15:05.166 --> 15:07.250
She set her purse on fire.

15:07.333 --> 15:08.792
(laughs)
She what?

15:08.875 --> 15:11.208
What? I don't remember this.

15:11.291 --> 15:13.291
She was smoking
in the bathroom at school,

15:13.375 --> 15:14.709
and someone came in.

15:14.792 --> 15:16.208
She wanted to save the butt.

15:16.291 --> 15:18.333
Thought she put it out,
stuck it in her purse.

15:18.417 --> 15:20.333
She got back to class,
and the purse went up in flames.

15:20.417 --> 15:22.083
(all laughing)

15:24.583 --> 15:26.166
Ah, shit.

15:27.583 --> 15:30.041
We get there...

15:31.750 --> 15:34.125
I go in alone.

15:38.250 --> 15:42.500
So, Ray said get rid of
everything that's federal.

15:42.583 --> 15:45.125
Anything that could
bring federal charges.

15:45.208 --> 15:46.750
He say why?

15:46.834 --> 15:48.000
No.

15:48.083 --> 15:49.917
Jesus Christ.
Everything we've done here

15:50.000 --> 15:52.083
for the last 15 years
would bring federal charges.

15:52.166 --> 15:54.125
Hmm, you want me to
take over for a while?

15:54.208 --> 15:54.625
No, that's okay. I have it.

15:54.709 --> 15:56.959
Can I have some?

15:57.041 --> 16:00.250
Um...

16:00.333 --> 16:03.792
so, what happened
with that woman?

16:03.875 --> 16:06.333
(groans)

16:06.417 --> 16:07.542
She's a fucking hypocrite.

16:07.625 --> 16:08.792
Why?

16:08.875 --> 16:10.792
Won't leave her husband.

16:10.875 --> 16:12.667
She's using me.

16:12.750 --> 16:16.709
It's a mid-life crisis,
fuck-a-lesbian kind of thing.

16:16.792 --> 16:19.417
Really?
Yeah.

16:19.500 --> 16:22.041
So, why don't you talk to her?

16:22.125 --> 16:23.417
About what?

16:23.500 --> 16:26.000
I don't know. Your feelings.

16:26.083 --> 16:28.583
You have feelings,
don't you?

16:28.667 --> 16:31.709
Not really. No.

16:31.792 --> 16:32.542
You should talk to her.

16:32.625 --> 16:33.583
Tell her you love her.

16:33.667 --> 16:34.667
But I don't love her.

16:34.750 --> 16:36.959
Tell her anyway.

16:37.041 --> 16:40.375
It's good
to talk things through.

16:40.458 --> 16:42.875
Listen to me.

16:47.667 --> 16:50.125
I'll think about it.

16:53.834 --> 16:56.208
(indistinct chatter)

17:16.583 --> 17:17.792
Hey, you!

17:23.750 --> 17:25.083
(grunts)
RAY:
Ooh.

17:25.166 --> 17:26.458
(grunting)

17:31.625 --> 17:33.583
Uh-oh.

17:33.667 --> 17:34.959
Sir?

17:35.041 --> 17:35.959
No, you don't want to do that.
Gene!

17:36.041 --> 17:38.500
Ah, geez.
Break it up, guys. Come on.

17:38.583 --> 17:39.792
Break it up.
They got it under control.

17:39.875 --> 17:42.083
Come on, that's not fair.
See?

17:42.166 --> 17:42.542
Ah, shit.

17:42.625 --> 17:45.625
Ter?

17:45.709 --> 17:47.583
Ah, Bunch,
what the fuck are you doing?

17:47.667 --> 17:49.417
He's already down!

17:53.291 --> 17:55.500
Okay! Okay!
Get up! Get up!

17:58.208 --> 17:59.458
I'm sorry.

17:59.542 --> 18:00.166
All right?

18:00.250 --> 18:02.792
I didn't know she was married.

18:02.875 --> 18:04.500
But you don't hit a lady.

18:04.583 --> 18:06.917
She's not a lady;
she's a fucking whore.

18:16.959 --> 18:20.041
Get in the car,
you maniac.

18:27.458 --> 18:29.875
Ooh.

18:29.959 --> 18:32.291
Ain't this something?

18:32.375 --> 18:33.834
Unisex.

18:33.917 --> 18:36.041
So, tell me
about yourself, Mickey.

18:37.750 --> 18:39.500
I got five kids.

18:39.583 --> 18:42.083
Four boys.

18:42.166 --> 18:44.291
One girl.

18:44.375 --> 18:45.834
She's gone.

18:47.458 --> 18:50.208
Oh, I'm sorry.

18:51.625 --> 18:54.667
Drugs.

18:56.291 --> 18:58.750
Four of them, I had
with my first wife.

18:58.834 --> 19:01.875
She died of cancer.

19:01.959 --> 19:03.917
The youngest, I had
with my girlfriend.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.375
She's married now.

19:05.458 --> 19:08.208
She lives in Palm Springs
with a big producer.

19:08.291 --> 19:10.208
Allen Weisbrod.

19:10.291 --> 19:11.500
I know Allen.

19:11.583 --> 19:13.083
Are you talking about Claudette?

19:14.458 --> 19:16.917
Yeah. Claudette.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.333
Ain't that something?

19:19.417 --> 19:20.166
We're practically related.

19:20.250 --> 19:23.500
You're an interesting man,
Mickey.

19:23.583 --> 19:26.583
I thought all you guys
from Boston were racist.

19:26.667 --> 19:28.625
Not me. I'm not prejudiced.

19:28.709 --> 19:29.458
I don't like black men much.

19:32.500 --> 19:34.625
You're a trip.

19:36.375 --> 19:39.917
Maybe we could collaborate
on something.

19:41.208 --> 19:43.917
(exhales)
ABBY:
Hey, Juliet.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.083
It's Mrs. Donovan, Abby.

19:46.166 --> 19:48.375
I was just wondering
if you'd seen Bridget.

19:48.458 --> 19:49.875
I haven't seen her. Um...

19:49.959 --> 19:52.333
if-if she's with you,

19:52.417 --> 19:56.375
I'm not angry. I promise
I won't be mad or anything.

19:56.458 --> 19:58.583
Just... can you tell her
to call me?

19:58.667 --> 20:00.750
Thanks.

20:01.250 --> 20:04.208
(phone ringing)

20:07.250 --> 20:09.000
Hello?

20:09.083 --> 20:12.542
Hey. I just called the house
and no one picked up.

20:13.709 --> 20:15.208
I'm just out doing errands.

20:15.291 --> 20:17.375
She okay?

20:17.458 --> 20:19.041
Yeah, she's fine.

20:19.125 --> 20:20.583
She's sleeping.

20:20.667 --> 20:22.166
All right. I'll see you later.
(beep)

20:22.250 --> 20:25.458
TERRY:
Why isn't Bridget
in school?

20:25.542 --> 20:28.291
She got her
belly button pierced.
So?

20:28.375 --> 20:30.375
What's wrong with that?
We had a deal.

20:30.458 --> 20:32.125
Nothing till she's 18.

20:32.208 --> 20:33.000
You're a hard man, Ray.

20:33.083 --> 20:35.083
What are you talking about?

20:35.166 --> 20:37.166
Eh, you got to be careful
with girls.

20:37.250 --> 20:39.583
You got to be...

20:39.667 --> 20:41.041
gentle.
(chuckles)

20:41.125 --> 20:44.959
(snorts, laughs)
What?

20:45.041 --> 20:46.709
You don't even
have kids, Ter.

20:46.792 --> 20:49.375
Yeah, you got a girl now.
Now you're a fucking expert?

20:49.458 --> 20:51.375
Right?
Fuck you.

20:51.458 --> 20:53.417
Kids need rules.
(phone vibrating)

20:57.834 --> 20:58.500
Yeah, Av.

20:58.583 --> 21:00.834
You hear from the Armenian yet?

21:00.917 --> 21:02.709
He's on his way here,
and he's pissed off.

21:02.792 --> 21:06.125
Good.

21:07.083 --> 21:09.000
Kids need love.

21:11.083 --> 21:13.500
I got something
I got to take care of.

21:13.583 --> 21:14.917
I'll be back, though,
finish what we started.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.333
Suit yourself.

21:29.959 --> 21:31.125
All the way down, baby.

21:31.208 --> 21:32.709
(men speaking indistinctly)

21:32.792 --> 21:35.250
(horn honks)

21:45.583 --> 21:47.959
(siren wailing)

21:51.125 --> 21:53.542
(woman speaking indistinctly)

22:00.834 --> 22:03.542
Hey, Lena.

22:03.625 --> 22:04.500
She expecting you?

22:05.792 --> 22:07.208
What are you doing here?

22:07.291 --> 22:09.375
Look, I'm sorry
I didn't call you...

22:09.458 --> 22:10.709
(gasps)

22:10.792 --> 22:12.542
Oh, my God!

22:12.625 --> 22:13.875
I think you broke my nose!

22:13.959 --> 22:16.041
Wendy, call security!

22:16.125 --> 22:17.583
Oh, my God!

22:34.208 --> 22:36.542
Hello again.

22:39.500 --> 22:40.750
How are you?

22:40.834 --> 22:43.250
Good.
Very relaxed.

22:43.333 --> 22:46.125
I, uh... I just
got a rubdown.

22:46.208 --> 22:49.083
Liked everything
but the music.

22:51.333 --> 22:54.667
So, Mickey, would you like
to go and get a drink?

22:55.792 --> 22:58.875
Well, I live over in Hollywood.

22:58.959 --> 23:01.542
Got a bottle of Jameson.
The place belongs to my son.

23:01.625 --> 23:03.709
But it ain't no place
for a lady like you.

23:03.792 --> 23:05.625
You don't want
to go there.

23:05.709 --> 23:06.583
Well, I'm tougher than I look.

23:09.083 --> 23:09.834
I like living on the edge.

23:09.917 --> 23:12.375
Yeah?

23:13.458 --> 23:15.208
I'll see you in the lobby.

23:15.291 --> 23:17.417
Okay.

23:33.750 --> 23:37.208
Is this where
your mom died?

23:37.291 --> 23:38.542
Yeah.

23:44.959 --> 23:47.333
Hey, no.

23:47.417 --> 23:51.166
No, don't be crying, boo.
It's okay.

23:51.250 --> 23:52.875
She put herself there.

24:04.375 --> 24:07.917
You think you intimidate me?

24:08.000 --> 24:09.333
You motherfuckers.

24:09.417 --> 24:10.667
I'll kill you.

24:10.750 --> 24:12.583
What the fuck?
You burn my fucking...

24:14.917 --> 24:17.166
(sighs)

24:20.417 --> 24:21.667
Tie him up.

24:21.750 --> 24:22.709
I'm gonna go
get some coffee.

24:26.625 --> 24:28.834
Oh. Ladies fist.

24:34.291 --> 24:36.458
We're out of toilet paper.

24:36.542 --> 24:37.917
Uh-huh.

24:55.291 --> 24:57.542
You know how to twerk?

24:57.625 --> 24:58.959
Twerk?

24:59.041 --> 25:01.208
What?

25:01.291 --> 25:03.417
We'll get to that.

25:03.500 --> 25:04.834
(chuckles)

25:07.875 --> 25:09.792
Do you have any ice?

25:09.875 --> 25:12.500
Ice.

25:16.166 --> 25:19.792
She's so pretty.

25:19.875 --> 25:21.917
(Bridget chuckles)

25:26.792 --> 25:28.667
I'm sorry I was rough, shawty.

25:31.500 --> 25:32.917
I fucked up.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.875
It's okay.

25:37.250 --> 25:39.458
I'm sorry, too.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.166
What did my father do to you?

25:53.625 --> 25:54.875
(sighs)

25:58.959 --> 26:00.375
Nothing.

26:04.041 --> 26:04.750
(sighs)

26:08.875 --> 26:10.333
Brought me back where I belong.

26:10.417 --> 26:12.750
You don't belong here.

26:12.834 --> 26:13.166
Yeah, I do, shawty.

26:13.250 --> 26:16.125
My house, too.

26:16.208 --> 26:18.125
I was born here.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.375
I'm gonna make a music video...

26:21.458 --> 26:24.250
right here in the crime scene.

26:24.333 --> 26:26.667
Re-Kon says
my street cred's gonna go

26:26.750 --> 26:28.417
through the roof.

26:28.500 --> 26:29.959
I think you're brave, Marvin.

26:32.500 --> 26:34.125
Well, I'm the black Obi-Wan,
baby.

26:34.208 --> 26:37.417
Strike me down,
I come back two times stronger.

26:37.500 --> 26:38.792
(laughs)

26:41.083 --> 26:42.000
Look at me.

26:42.083 --> 26:45.375
Look at me.

26:47.250 --> 26:49.500
You took advantage
of my brother.

26:49.583 --> 26:51.250
What you mean, "took advantage"?

26:51.333 --> 26:52.750
He's grown man.

26:52.834 --> 26:53.417
I want the fucking money back.

26:53.500 --> 26:56.792
No way. Go fuck yourself.

26:56.875 --> 26:58.041
(Taser clicking,
Aram groaning)

26:58.125 --> 27:00.834
Fuck you!

27:00.917 --> 27:01.250
Let's try this again.

27:01.333 --> 27:05.125
(Aram pants)

27:05.208 --> 27:06.750
I want my brother's
money back.

27:06.834 --> 27:09.000
Not all of it.
There was fire.

27:09.083 --> 27:10.917
Smoke damage
very bad.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.417
(Taser clicking,
Aram groaning)

27:12.500 --> 27:13.208
(loud groaning)

27:13.291 --> 27:16.667
(panting)

27:18.166 --> 27:20.083
I want the money back.

27:22.250 --> 27:24.500
Okay. I make settlement, huh?

27:24.583 --> 27:25.917
Half.

27:26.000 --> 27:29.125
(Taser clicking,
Aram groaning)

27:29.208 --> 27:31.709
(loud groan, sigh)

27:31.792 --> 27:32.166
All.

27:32.250 --> 27:35.417
(panting)

27:35.500 --> 27:38.166
Okay, okay.

27:38.250 --> 27:40.667
You take check?

27:40.750 --> 27:42.417
Cash.
Can't do.

27:42.500 --> 27:44.834
No cash. Okay!

27:44.917 --> 27:45.709
Yes, cash.

27:45.792 --> 27:49.500
Keep him here till
you get the money.

27:49.583 --> 27:52.458
Okay.

27:52.542 --> 27:54.041
Hi, boss. Where you going?

27:54.125 --> 27:55.917
Got a family thing.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.375
Hi.
Hey.

27:59.709 --> 28:01.333
So, did you talk to her?

28:01.417 --> 28:02.917
Yeah, sort of.

28:03.000 --> 28:04.750
And how'd it go?

28:04.834 --> 28:07.125
Not bad.

28:08.709 --> 28:10.750
So, that's
federal, right?

28:10.834 --> 28:10.875
Yeah.

28:24.750 --> 28:27.250
(footsteps approaching)

28:27.333 --> 28:29.750
You want to see my
belly button piercing?

28:29.834 --> 28:31.458
Yeah.

28:32.959 --> 28:35.125
Dang, that hurts.

28:35.208 --> 28:36.792
(laughs)

28:36.875 --> 28:38.500
Let me see. Ew!

28:38.583 --> 28:41.083
My fucking parents
overreacted.

28:43.375 --> 28:44.458
You know, you're lucky
you have folks

28:44.542 --> 28:47.041
who care
about you so much.

29:01.375 --> 29:04.333
I want to have sex.

29:04.417 --> 29:06.250
I do.

29:11.250 --> 29:13.542
I don't think so.

29:13.625 --> 29:14.458
Why not?

29:14.542 --> 29:17.333
Why not, Marvin?

29:17.417 --> 29:19.208
'Cause your father put
a fucking gun in my mouth.

29:19.291 --> 29:23.125
That's why.

29:23.792 --> 29:26.500
It's why I'm sleeping here.

29:27.959 --> 29:30.834
It's why I'm not coming
back to Calabasas.

29:31.583 --> 29:34.125
I shouldn't even
be touching you.

29:34.208 --> 29:36.917
I'm staying here tonight.

29:41.709 --> 29:44.083
(sighs)

29:50.250 --> 29:52.583
(phone ringing)

29:57.583 --> 29:58.834
Bridget.

29:58.917 --> 30:00.375
Mrs. Donovan, it's Marvin.

30:00.458 --> 30:01.709
Bridget's here with me.

30:01.792 --> 30:03.208
Oh, thank God.

30:03.291 --> 30:04.709
Where are you?

30:04.792 --> 30:06.750
It's for your own good,
baby girl.

30:06.834 --> 30:08.792
(distant siren wailing)

30:13.583 --> 30:16.291
Whiskey.

30:16.375 --> 30:18.625
It's good.

30:18.709 --> 30:21.917
Yeah. It's good.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.875
(laughs)

30:23.959 --> 30:26.166
(smacks lips)

30:26.250 --> 30:28.417
I was good-looking
back in the day.

30:28.500 --> 30:31.917
You're good-looking now.

30:32.375 --> 30:34.709
(laughs)

30:34.792 --> 30:37.250
I don't think I could fuck you.

30:37.333 --> 30:39.333
You're too old for me.

30:39.417 --> 30:40.041
How about a blow job?

30:44.750 --> 30:47.375
I couldn't.

30:48.500 --> 30:50.333
I'm kind of over it.

30:50.417 --> 30:51.917
(laughs)

30:52.000 --> 30:53.792
Ah, come on.

30:57.500 --> 30:59.000
You'd have to put a gun
to my head.

31:03.500 --> 31:06.083
Would you excuse me
for a minute?

31:25.709 --> 31:27.834
Get on
your knees.
Oh, God!

31:27.917 --> 31:28.375
Get on your knees.

31:28.458 --> 31:30.709
(crying):
God.

31:30.792 --> 31:32.291
(glass clinking)

31:32.375 --> 31:34.500
Now, suck it.
(crying)

31:34.583 --> 31:36.500
Suck it!

31:39.417 --> 31:44.125
(sobbing)

31:46.625 --> 31:48.959
Oh, shit.

31:49.041 --> 31:50.959
I thought
I was following your lead.

31:51.041 --> 31:52.625
(sobbing)

31:52.709 --> 31:54.667
Oh, shit.
I've been in the can

31:54.750 --> 31:55.500
for 20 years.
Maybe I don't know

31:55.583 --> 31:57.959
how to be
with women.

31:58.041 --> 31:58.417
I'm sorry.

31:58.500 --> 32:01.917
I'm sorry.

32:04.583 --> 32:06.583
Uh... I'm...

32:06.667 --> 32:09.041
I'm gonna leave now.

32:11.041 --> 32:12.458
Don't try and stop me.

32:12.542 --> 32:14.333
Stop you?

32:14.417 --> 32:16.834
Stop you?!

32:16.917 --> 32:18.834
You think
I could stick my dick in you

32:18.917 --> 32:20.333
with your white ass
and your fake tits?

32:20.417 --> 32:24.625
Get the fuck out of here,
you fucking tourist!
(crying)

32:24.709 --> 32:25.375
Am I authentic enough for you?

32:25.458 --> 32:27.875
Huh?

32:27.959 --> 32:30.291
(door closes)

32:35.458 --> 32:36.834
TERRY:
"May the road rise up
to meet you.

32:36.917 --> 32:40.000
"May the wind be ever
at your back.

32:40.083 --> 32:43.500
"May the sun shine
warm upon your face

32:43.583 --> 32:46.375
"and the rain fall softly
on your fields.

32:46.458 --> 32:48.709
"And until we meet again,

32:48.792 --> 32:51.709
may God hold you in the hollow
of his hand."

33:01.792 --> 33:04.959
What does that mean,

33:05.041 --> 33:08.709
"the hollow
of his hand"?

33:08.792 --> 33:10.208
His palm?

33:10.291 --> 33:13.375
(laughing):
And she didn't have no
fucking fields, either.

33:13.458 --> 33:15.375
(laughs)

33:15.458 --> 33:18.417
So they couldn't
have been rained upon.
Don't be disrespectful.

33:18.500 --> 33:21.333
I'm not.

33:26.834 --> 33:28.667
Hey, remember when we dislocated
her shoulders?

33:28.750 --> 33:30.250
(laughs)

33:30.333 --> 33:31.959
Jesus, we did.

33:32.041 --> 33:34.750
We were pulling her
between us, right?
Yeah.

33:34.834 --> 33:36.417
We both wanted to play with her,

33:36.500 --> 33:38.041
so we kept pulling on her
and pulling on her

33:38.125 --> 33:41.333
until... you heard
that crack, crack.

33:41.417 --> 33:42.667
Dislocated both
her shoulders.

33:42.750 --> 33:45.125
Ma beat me so bad

33:45.208 --> 33:47.250
I couldn't sit for a week.
(laughs)

33:47.333 --> 33:49.583
Mickey did that to her.

33:49.667 --> 33:52.125
What, Ray?
Her shoulders.

33:52.208 --> 33:53.792
Mickey did that to her.

33:55.250 --> 33:56.500
No, he didn't.

33:56.583 --> 33:58.792
Yeah, he did.
He didn't, Raymond.

33:58.875 --> 34:00.375
Bunchy and I did.

34:00.458 --> 34:02.375
You sure?
Sure, I'm sure.

34:02.458 --> 34:04.166
I remember
getting beat for it.

34:04.250 --> 34:05.875
We both got the belt.

34:12.750 --> 34:16.125
Did you fuck him?

34:17.500 --> 34:20.458
You don't use
that language.

34:20.542 --> 34:22.875
You're from Calabasas.

34:22.959 --> 34:24.583
You're so upper-class.

34:24.667 --> 34:26.458
You're so spiritual.

34:26.542 --> 34:29.208
You and Daddy are racists.

34:29.291 --> 34:31.917
You're just a racist
fucking housewife!

34:32.000 --> 34:35.750
And you live with Daddy,
who put a gun in Marvin's mouth!

34:35.834 --> 34:38.375
He's an animal.
You're married to an animal.

34:38.458 --> 34:40.583
Shut up! Just
fucking shut up!

34:41.709 --> 34:43.625
(sniffles, exhales)

34:43.709 --> 34:47.250
(sniffles)

34:53.709 --> 34:56.875
If that boy got
you pregnant,

34:56.959 --> 34:59.709
I'm not taking you
for an abortion.

34:59.792 --> 35:02.208
Have the kid.

35:04.542 --> 35:07.458
And ruin your
fucking life.

35:13.583 --> 35:17.250
You cut her pigtails off and
threw 'em behind the radiator.

35:17.333 --> 35:20.333
I did?
Yeah, you were jealous of her,

35:20.417 --> 35:23.166
so you waited till Ma wasn't
around and you got her scissors

35:23.250 --> 35:25.417
and you whacked off her pigtails
so she wouldn't look

35:25.500 --> 35:26.917
so fucking cute.
(laughs)

35:27.000 --> 35:29.959
You don't
remember that?

35:30.041 --> 35:32.208
That whole winter, every
time the radiator went on,

35:32.291 --> 35:34.375
Ma was like,
"What's that smell?"
"What's that smell?"

35:34.458 --> 35:36.000
(all laughing)

35:39.959 --> 35:42.291
Ah, my boys are here.

35:46.625 --> 35:48.500
Why all the sad faces?

36:04.792 --> 36:06.583
It's your daughter's birthday,
you prick.

36:16.625 --> 36:19.750
What about my money, Ray?

36:19.834 --> 36:22.417
You're not getting
that money back, Bunch.

36:22.500 --> 36:23.750
Why?

36:23.834 --> 36:26.083
We're going back
to the old arrangement.

36:26.166 --> 36:27.583
I got things that I want to do.
Things?

36:27.667 --> 36:31.041
What things?

36:31.125 --> 36:32.083
(quietly):
Ever since he's been back here,

36:32.166 --> 36:34.375
he's been putting shit
in your head.

36:34.458 --> 36:36.834
You've been drinking,
out of control.

36:36.917 --> 36:37.417
Come on.

36:39.333 --> 36:41.625
(chuckles)

36:43.625 --> 36:45.458
Maybe you're right.

36:45.542 --> 36:47.083
He's been messing
with my head.

36:47.166 --> 36:48.959
You're right.

36:52.792 --> 36:54.208
All right.

36:55.125 --> 36:58.333
It's my fucking money!

36:59.834 --> 37:02.125
Do you have any idea
what I had to go through

37:02.208 --> 37:02.500
to get that money back?

37:02.583 --> 37:05.375
Huh?

37:10.083 --> 37:12.583
I burned a building down
and tortured a guy.

37:12.667 --> 37:15.208
I've always taken care
of you, Bunch.

37:15.291 --> 37:16.792
And I always will.

37:28.709 --> 37:30.083
Yep, it's all here.

37:36.792 --> 37:40.125
Okay.

37:44.750 --> 37:48.041
Please.

37:50.417 --> 37:52.417
It's a pleasure
doing business with you.

37:56.250 --> 37:59.125
You know,
you're making a big mistake.

37:59.208 --> 38:02.000
'Cause you had a great deal
with that house.

38:02.083 --> 38:04.458
Very foolish.

38:24.375 --> 38:26.291
First you follow me home,

38:26.375 --> 38:28.291
then you beat up my husband?

38:29.375 --> 38:31.458
Eh, you knew
I was gonna do that.

38:31.542 --> 38:32.458
That's why you come over here.

38:35.583 --> 38:36.875
He hit you.

38:36.959 --> 38:39.041
I threw the first punch.

38:39.125 --> 38:41.041
Good for you.

38:45.959 --> 38:48.250
Sweetheart,

38:48.333 --> 38:49.709
what are we doing?

38:49.792 --> 38:51.166
You're cheating on him.

38:51.250 --> 38:52.709
It's not fair.

38:52.792 --> 38:55.375
Fair? Who cares
about fair?

38:55.458 --> 38:56.875
I'm in love with you.

38:59.000 --> 39:02.083
There are arrangements
that people live with.

39:02.166 --> 39:04.250
That's indecent.

39:04.333 --> 39:07.291
You can't go from his bed
into mine.

39:07.375 --> 39:09.000
If it was
so indecent,

39:09.083 --> 39:11.709
then why did you keep
fucking me? You knew about it.

39:16.500 --> 39:18.709
So...

39:18.792 --> 39:20.667
it's over between us.

39:25.917 --> 39:29.291
(chair creaks)

39:38.875 --> 39:41.750
(door opens)

39:42.208 --> 39:44.792
(door shuts)

39:44.875 --> 39:47.250
(footsteps approaching)

39:56.917 --> 40:00.250
You okay?

40:08.500 --> 40:10.417
Jesus, Ray,
you stink.

40:10.500 --> 40:12.750
(chuckles)
Come here.

40:19.750 --> 40:21.458
How's Bridg?

40:21.542 --> 40:23.625
She's a little bitch.
(laughs)

40:23.709 --> 40:27.458
She thinks I'm an idiot
and you're an animal.

40:27.542 --> 40:31.291
Well, she's right
about one of us.

40:39.542 --> 40:41.875
(both laughing)

40:47.417 --> 40:48.959
I love you, Abs.
All right, Ray.

40:49.041 --> 40:52.417
(laughs)

40:54.250 --> 40:55.250
I'll buy you anything you want.

40:55.333 --> 40:58.834
What do you want?
(sighs)

40:58.917 --> 41:00.250
Huh?

41:07.291 --> 41:09.333
What I want, you can't give me.

41:09.417 --> 41:09.709
Try me.

41:14.792 --> 41:16.667
Emotional honesty.

41:17.083 --> 41:20.750
Oh, geez.

41:20.834 --> 41:22.792
You been seeing
that same therapist

41:22.875 --> 41:25.709
you sent Bridget to?
Fuck you. Maybe I should.

41:29.959 --> 41:32.792
All right.

41:34.250 --> 41:35.625
(grunts)

41:36.834 --> 41:38.667
(sighs)

41:38.750 --> 41:41.458
What would
I tell him, Ray?

41:41.542 --> 41:43.041
Conor hitting that kid

41:43.125 --> 41:44.667
in the back
of the head?

41:44.750 --> 41:46.834
The way we fucked up our kids?

41:46.917 --> 41:47.458
We didn't fuck up our kids.

41:47.542 --> 41:49.125
How you hate your father?

41:49.208 --> 41:51.417
The way we have

41:51.500 --> 41:53.333
to hide out in Calabasas?

41:55.583 --> 41:56.917
The way you fuck?

41:57.000 --> 41:59.250
I thought you liked
the way I fuck.

41:59.333 --> 42:00.500
I do.

42:00.583 --> 42:02.750
It taps right
into my own issues.

42:03.125 --> 42:06.875
(laughs)

42:06.959 --> 42:08.625
You're fucking nuts,

42:08.709 --> 42:10.291
you know that?
Am I?

42:11.667 --> 42:14.959
Why was there a handcuff
in your bathroom?

42:15.041 --> 42:18.458
You had a girl
in there, didn't you?
Oh, come on, Abs.

42:18.542 --> 42:19.333
Make up your mind.

42:19.417 --> 42:21.417
I'm in love with a dead girl,

42:21.500 --> 42:22.709
I'm in love
with a live girl.

42:22.792 --> 42:24.875
Which is it?
You tell me.

42:27.333 --> 42:29.333
You're fucking crazy.

42:29.417 --> 42:32.875
There's nothing
to tell.

42:32.959 --> 42:34.667
I could smell her on you.

42:37.583 --> 42:40.500
What?
That night when I went
to your apartment

42:40.583 --> 42:41.750
and surprised you.

42:41.834 --> 42:43.959
I could smell her sex on you.

42:58.417 --> 42:59.750
(sighs)

43:25.417 --> 43:27.834
(shoes squeaking softly)

43:44.542 --> 43:46.792
I need confession.

43:46.875 --> 43:49.250
(crickets chirping)

44:04.500 --> 44:06.875
I'm gonna start.

44:06.959 --> 44:09.000
May I ask your name?

44:09.083 --> 44:11.667
Terrence.

44:17.000 --> 44:20.542
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

44:20.625 --> 44:22.959
How long has it been
since your last confession?

44:23.041 --> 44:23.792
Three years.

44:30.417 --> 44:32.542
It's a sin not to go to church.

44:32.625 --> 44:34.458
You're here now.

44:34.542 --> 44:35.834
What do you wish to confess?

44:39.625 --> 44:42.125
I committed adultery.

44:42.208 --> 44:44.917
You're married, and
you've transgressed?

44:45.000 --> 44:47.208
The other way around.

44:49.625 --> 44:51.625
I'm not following.

44:51.709 --> 44:53.333
I'm not married.

44:53.417 --> 44:54.333
She's  married.

44:54.417 --> 44:56.709
It's a mortal sin.

44:56.792 --> 44:58.709
You've been here
less than two minutes,

44:58.792 --> 45:01.458
and you've already committed
two sins.

45:01.542 --> 45:02.709
What's your point?

45:02.792 --> 45:03.291
You're very hard on yourself.

45:03.375 --> 45:07.750
God doesn't condemn us.

45:07.834 --> 45:10.125
(sniffling)

45:21.875 --> 45:24.208
(indistinct chatter)

45:24.291 --> 45:26.709
WOMAN:
Here you go.

45:30.166 --> 45:32.500
(indistinct chatter)

45:36.542 --> 45:38.375
(laughter, indistinct chatter)

45:38.458 --> 45:40.875
(van doors closing)

45:51.125 --> 45:53.583
PRIEST:
What's on your heart, Terry?

45:56.208 --> 45:57.583
Do you live alone?

45:57.667 --> 45:59.834
Yeah.

45:59.917 --> 46:01.667
Is that hard?

46:01.750 --> 46:04.125
Is it lonely?

46:06.792 --> 46:08.375
I committed adultery.

46:08.458 --> 46:11.166
Plain and simple.

46:11.250 --> 46:12.875
Do you intend to stop?

46:22.875 --> 46:25.000
You know, Terry,

46:25.083 --> 46:28.959
everyone needs love.

46:33.542 --> 46:36.083
You're not helping me.

46:54.917 --> 46:57.250
BRIDGET:
Come in.

47:02.500 --> 47:04.250
Hey.

47:04.333 --> 47:05.834
Hey.

47:07.792 --> 47:10.041
Am I in trouble, Daddy?

47:12.500 --> 47:14.917
Not with me.

47:17.000 --> 47:19.291
Are you drunk?

47:20.583 --> 47:22.291
A little.

47:22.375 --> 47:25.458
Why?

47:27.583 --> 47:30.000
It's your Auntie Bridget's
birthday, and, uh...

47:30.083 --> 47:34.250
my brothers and I--
we like to raise a glass to her

47:34.333 --> 47:35.917
every year we're together.

47:37.166 --> 47:39.208
That's beautiful.

47:52.166 --> 47:53.750
(sighs)

47:53.834 --> 47:55.542
Remember when I
told you that, uh,

47:55.625 --> 47:59.125
she killed herself?

47:59.208 --> 48:01.625
I didn't tell you why.

48:07.041 --> 48:09.417
She was pregnant.

48:10.041 --> 48:12.166
And she was on drugs.

48:16.125 --> 48:19.125
See, honey, that's why...

48:19.208 --> 48:21.166
that's why I worry
about you so much, 'cause...

48:25.625 --> 48:27.166
...some things in life,
you can't take back.

48:32.333 --> 48:34.709
Some things change you forever.

48:39.542 --> 48:41.500
Ow.
What?

48:41.583 --> 48:44.375
My piercing hurts.

48:44.959 --> 48:47.375
You didn't take it out?

48:47.458 --> 48:49.500
No.

48:51.125 --> 48:53.458
Bridg.

48:55.917 --> 48:56.417
Aah.

48:56.500 --> 48:59.542
Oh, Jesus Christ.

48:59.625 --> 49:01.208
Mmm.

49:04.375 --> 49:06.125
Oh.
Oh, that looks sore.

49:06.208 --> 49:08.875
I know.

49:08.959 --> 49:09.583
It hurts, Daddy.

49:09.667 --> 49:12.125
Oh, sweetheart. Come here.

49:17.417 --> 49:18.834
(sighs)

49:18.917 --> 49:22.083
This bed is
so freaking small.

49:22.166 --> 49:24.417
I know. I thought
it was just me.

49:24.500 --> 49:26.041
It is you.
(laughs)

49:26.125 --> 49:26.625
You're big.

49:26.709 --> 49:29.125
God, you got so big.

49:31.875 --> 49:35.250
You remember that song you used
to sing to me when I was little?

49:35.333 --> 49:37.709
Yeah.

49:37.792 --> 49:39.500
