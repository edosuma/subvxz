00:01.436 --> 00:01.653
.

00:01.697 --> 00:03.699
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:03.742 --> 00:05.135
sexually based offenses

00:05.179 --> 00:06.658
are considered
especially heinous.

00:06.702 --> 00:08.791
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:08.834 --> 00:10.836
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:10.880 --> 00:12.186
are members of an elite squad

00:12.229 --> 00:14.275
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.318 --> 00:16.103
These are their stories.

00:18.496 --> 00:20.324
- It's called
tardive dyskinesia.

00:20.368 --> 00:22.065
It's a complication that arises

00:22.109 --> 00:25.199
from long-term use
of anti-psychotic medications.

00:25.242 --> 00:26.678
- How long has she been
like this?

00:26.722 --> 00:28.289
- Well, a few days.

00:28.332 --> 00:30.291
I know it's counterintuitive,

00:30.334 --> 00:33.816
but increasing her dosage
is sometimes effective.

00:33.859 --> 00:35.209
- What if we, um--

00:35.252 --> 00:37.080
what if we took her
off her meds entirely?

00:37.124 --> 00:39.343
- That's also an option,
but, uh,

00:39.387 --> 00:42.346
the fact is, your sister
is severely psychotic.

00:42.390 --> 00:45.567
The last time we took her
off meds for a few days,

00:45.610 --> 00:47.351
she attempted suicide.

00:47.395 --> 00:49.179
- You're her doctor;
whatever you think is--

00:49.223 --> 00:52.052
- I-I can't make this decision
for you.

00:52.095 --> 00:55.098
Your father gave you
power of attorney.

00:55.142 --> 00:56.491
- But...

00:57.231 --> 00:58.884
She doesn't even know
who I am.

00:58.928 --> 01:00.756
- She's still your sister.

01:02.584 --> 01:03.889
Here.

01:03.933 --> 01:05.239
Take a couple of days.

01:05.282 --> 01:07.719
Read this literature on TD.

01:07.763 --> 01:10.505
Um, sit with her.

01:10.548 --> 01:11.723
But Peter,

01:11.767 --> 01:13.116
you need to make this decision

01:13.160 --> 01:14.857
sooner, rather than later.

01:22.256 --> 01:24.693
- "Nick! Nick!
You have to help me!

01:24.736 --> 01:26.216
Please, please help me!"

01:26.260 --> 01:27.739
"Mom, what's--
what's going on?

01:27.783 --> 01:28.827
What's wrong?"

01:28.871 --> 01:31.134
"I bought a $1,500 computer

01:31.178 --> 01:33.267
and it won't turn on!"

01:33.310 --> 01:35.573
"Mom, have you tried
holding down the power button?"

01:35.617 --> 01:37.532
"What's that?"

01:39.011 --> 01:40.056
- In my own defense--

01:40.100 --> 01:41.231
- In your own defense.

01:41.275 --> 01:43.146
What are you, Mommy Matlock?

01:43.190 --> 01:44.800
- Hey, Nicky,
you're out of ice.

01:44.843 --> 01:46.671
- Hey, chill, cuz.
Jules will be here soon, okay?

01:46.715 --> 01:48.238
- My sister--if she went
to Target,

01:48.282 --> 01:49.500
she's lost in the yoga section.

01:49.544 --> 01:51.285
- I drove in from Brooklyn.

01:51.328 --> 01:53.461
It would be nice if I
could see my grandchild

01:53.504 --> 01:55.202
before the end of the party.

01:55.245 --> 01:57.769
- Mom, cut Jules
some slack, please, okay?

02:00.032 --> 02:02.557
Oh, and there she is now.

02:02.600 --> 02:04.080
Hey, babe, you close?

02:04.124 --> 02:05.168
- Shut up, bitch!

02:08.911 --> 02:10.782
Jules, what--

02:10.826 --> 02:13.089
Who--Jules, who--

02:13.133 --> 02:14.830
Jules, talk to me!
Jules!

02:18.529 --> 02:20.749
She said he's gonna kill her.

02:26.015 --> 02:27.625
Jules has Ruby with her.

02:27.669 --> 02:29.192
Our daughter.
She's only four.

02:29.236 --> 02:30.672
- A child, out at that time--

02:30.715 --> 02:32.891
- No, Jules picked her up
from aftercare

02:32.935 --> 02:35.764
on her way home from work.
They were running some errands.

02:35.807 --> 02:37.244
- Okay the--the--the call.

02:37.287 --> 02:38.288
Did you recognize the voice?

02:38.332 --> 02:40.072
- Yes!
It's my w--

02:40.116 --> 02:41.639
We've been married ten years.
I think I know my wife's voice.

02:41.683 --> 02:44.294
- No, no, I'm--I'm talking
about the male voice.

02:44.338 --> 02:46.209
- Right.
Um, sorry.

02:46.253 --> 02:47.384
- No, that's--that's fine.

02:47.428 --> 02:50.213
Mr. Hunter, please,
take your time.

02:50.257 --> 02:52.172
- Wait, hold on.

02:52.215 --> 02:54.652
You think this is
someone we know?

02:54.696 --> 02:57.699
- Well, we have to consider
every possibility.

02:57.742 --> 03:00.223
- Did Jules mention anyone
giving her a hard time?

03:00.267 --> 03:02.051
- No, and she would've told me.

03:02.094 --> 03:04.227
We're not just sisters.
We're best friends.

03:05.533 --> 03:07.012
- I was gonna see her tonight.

03:09.537 --> 03:11.800
- Excuse me.
Rollins.

03:14.542 --> 03:16.065
Okay.

03:16.108 --> 03:17.501
Yeah, I got it.

03:17.545 --> 03:20.548
Hey.
- Excuse me one second, please.

03:21.679 --> 03:23.899
- TARU was able to trace
Jules' cell phone

03:23.942 --> 03:25.292
to a--to Remington Mall.

03:25.335 --> 03:27.424
It's in North Bergen,
New Jersey.

03:36.085 --> 03:38.740
- I got it.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.832
I got blood
on the steering wheel.

03:43.875 --> 03:44.876
Blood on the console.

03:44.920 --> 03:47.052
- Pink backpack.

03:47.096 --> 03:48.315
A kid's shoe.

03:48.358 --> 03:50.055
Ruby was definitely with her.

03:50.099 --> 03:51.753
- I got fingernail scratches.

03:51.796 --> 03:53.755
Looks like she fought
like hell.

03:55.539 --> 03:58.020
Looks like she had
some tire trouble.

03:59.500 --> 04:02.546
That wet spot--it's sticky.

04:02.590 --> 04:04.592
My guess is
some sort of tire sealant.

04:06.115 --> 04:07.856
- Looks like it's didn't take.
- It could be why

04:07.899 --> 04:09.074
she turned into the lot.

04:09.118 --> 04:10.293
- We found her phone

04:10.337 --> 04:11.338
in that garbage can,

04:11.381 --> 04:12.426
right over there.

04:12.469 --> 04:13.427
Along with this.

04:13.470 --> 04:15.037
Wallet, ID,

04:15.080 --> 04:16.212
cash, credit cards

04:16.256 --> 04:17.866
are gone.

04:22.827 --> 04:23.872
- Thank you.

04:25.439 --> 04:27.528
Did you find them?

04:27.571 --> 04:30.748
- We found your wife's car.

04:30.792 --> 04:32.620
- And what about
Jules and Ruby?

04:35.710 --> 04:38.800
- I'm sorry.

04:46.721 --> 04:46.938
.

04:49.985 --> 04:56.861
â™ª

05:32.332 --> 05:34.029
- Last time I saw her,

05:34.072 --> 05:35.247
she was in the kitchen.

05:35.291 --> 05:36.510
She was

05:36.553 --> 05:37.728
pounding garbanzo beans

05:37.772 --> 05:38.773
for Ruby's lunch.

05:38.816 --> 05:39.904
- She's a vegan.

05:39.948 --> 05:42.037
The poor girl's allergic
to everything.

05:42.080 --> 05:43.647
- I was late for work.

05:43.691 --> 05:45.301
I don't even know
if I kissed them goodbye.

05:45.345 --> 05:47.216
- Okay, did you speak
to your wife today?

05:47.259 --> 05:49.131
- Ah, I don't--

05:49.174 --> 05:50.698
Uh, I don't--

05:50.741 --> 05:52.830
I don't remember.
I'm s--

05:52.874 --> 05:54.354
What is wrong with me
right now?

05:54.397 --> 05:56.181
- This is all a huge shock,

05:56.225 --> 05:57.400
so let's just

05:57.444 --> 05:58.793
take it one step at a time,

05:58.836 --> 06:00.055
all right?

06:00.098 --> 06:02.187
Do you know what
your wife did today?

06:02.231 --> 06:03.580
Today's Tuesday.

06:03.624 --> 06:06.757
Um...

06:06.801 --> 06:09.281
She dropped Ruby off
at daycare

06:09.325 --> 06:10.848
and then she went to work.

06:10.892 --> 06:13.808
She's an editor at the
"New York Business Journal."

06:13.851 --> 06:15.462
I'm sorry.
I already told you that.

06:15.505 --> 06:16.724
- So let--let's stay focused.

06:16.767 --> 06:18.595
Right?
What else do you remember?

06:18.639 --> 06:20.858
Was there any--
any other contact

06:20.902 --> 06:22.773
with your wife today?

06:26.342 --> 06:28.388
I sent her a text.

06:28.431 --> 06:29.867
I sent her a text.

06:29.911 --> 06:31.695
Um, I asked if she could
stop by the grocery store

06:31.739 --> 06:33.567
and picks up some
chips and soda and ice

06:33.610 --> 06:35.220
for the party.
I-it was around 4:00.

06:36.308 --> 06:38.136
- Uh, yeah.
Um...

06:38.180 --> 06:39.224
"NP."

06:39.268 --> 06:41.139
- That's "no problem."

06:41.183 --> 06:43.315
- Thank you, Mrs. Hunter.

06:46.275 --> 06:48.320
Excuse me
for one moment.

06:50.322 --> 06:51.672
What's going on?

06:51.715 --> 06:53.630
- Nick told us
that Jules dropped Ruby off

06:53.674 --> 06:54.936
at Amsterdam Avenue Day Care,

06:54.979 --> 06:56.503
but I tracked down
the director,

06:56.546 --> 06:58.113
and she said that Ruby
was a no-show today.

06:58.156 --> 06:59.375
- Her boss at the magazine

06:59.419 --> 07:00.811
said she didn't make it there,
either.

07:00.855 --> 07:02.334
And he didn't think
to call Nick?

07:02.378 --> 07:04.206
- She doesn't come in
sometimes, so...

07:04.249 --> 07:08.253
- Could be that she has some
extracurricular activities.

07:08.297 --> 07:09.994
- Okay.

07:11.953 --> 07:15.609
I'm sorry, Mr. Hunter,
but, um, I have to ask.

07:15.652 --> 07:18.525
Were you and your wife
having any trouble recently?

07:20.309 --> 07:21.528
His whole life is Jules
and Ruby!

07:21.571 --> 07:23.617
- It's... just that

07:23.660 --> 07:26.010
Jules never made it
to work today,

07:26.054 --> 07:28.665
and Ruby never made it
to daycare.

07:30.798 --> 07:33.148
- Oh, God.
So this...

07:33.191 --> 07:34.454
animal has had them all day?

07:34.497 --> 07:36.891
Jesus, you call yourself
a detective?

07:36.934 --> 07:38.588
- Okay, has anything

07:38.632 --> 07:40.111
out of the ordinary happened--

07:40.155 --> 07:41.330
- Oh, for God's sake!

07:41.373 --> 07:42.505
You're wasting your time.

07:42.549 --> 07:44.289
Obviously, someone
has carjacked her.

07:44.333 --> 07:45.987
- Mom, look--

07:46.030 --> 07:48.250
okay, yes,
a couple of weeks ago,

07:48.293 --> 07:49.817
someone broke into our house.

07:49.860 --> 07:51.514
We filed a police report,
but they never found the guy.

07:51.558 --> 07:52.994
- Well, but we know who he was!
- Mom! Mom!

07:53.037 --> 07:54.561
He just wanted
to get even with you.

07:54.604 --> 07:56.214
You see, it's the contractor.

07:56.258 --> 07:58.042
A Jorge... Whatever.

07:58.086 --> 07:59.479
A Mexican.

07:59.522 --> 08:01.829
- Look, we could not prove
that he broke in.

08:01.872 --> 08:03.961
- He did a half-ass job
replacing the wood floors,

08:04.005 --> 08:06.355
Nick fired him,
and the very next day,

08:06.398 --> 08:08.009
their house was broken into.

08:08.052 --> 08:09.445
You do the math.

08:10.794 --> 08:13.101
- TARU's been combing through
the mall security footage.

08:13.144 --> 08:14.363
So far, nothing.

08:14.406 --> 08:16.408
- 'Kay, it just shouldn't be
that hard.

08:16.452 --> 08:17.888
- Tell that to TARU.
The mall manager

08:17.932 --> 08:19.890
says they get an average
of 30,000 visitors a day.

08:19.934 --> 08:22.023
- Okay.
That the contractor?

08:22.066 --> 08:23.372
- Yeah, Jorge Garcia.

08:23.415 --> 08:25.983
He has two DUIs
and an assault collar.

08:26.027 --> 08:28.029
- Okay.
Doesn't make him a kidnapper.

08:28.072 --> 08:30.161
- Or worse.
- Well, I'm not done.

08:30.205 --> 08:32.250
One of the neighbors,
Mrs. Rhonda Persky,

08:32.294 --> 08:34.209
says she saw Jorge and Jules

08:34.252 --> 08:36.516
arguing outside their apartment
the day before yesterday,

08:36.559 --> 08:38.430
and apparently,
it got pretty heated.

08:38.474 --> 08:40.563
Talk to him.

08:46.003 --> 08:47.701
- We want to talk to you
about Jules Hunter.

08:47.744 --> 08:49.746
- Let me guess.
Her son-of-a-bitch husband

08:49.790 --> 08:52.009
found out she paid me
for the work I did,

08:52.053 --> 08:53.794
sent you guys
to get his money back?

08:53.837 --> 08:55.404
- Jules Hunter paid you

08:55.447 --> 08:57.362
after she accused you
of breaking into her house?

08:57.406 --> 08:59.060
- No, her husband did that.

08:59.103 --> 09:00.670
She's a sweetheart.

09:00.714 --> 09:03.281
I don't see what she sees
in that two-timing SOB.

09:04.935 --> 09:06.633
- Dude was cheating on her.

09:06.676 --> 09:08.286
I saw it with my own eyes.

09:09.461 --> 09:11.333
- Couple days
after he fired me.

09:11.376 --> 09:12.856
Stopped at a red light
on 6th Ave,

09:12.900 --> 09:14.423
I look over,
and I see him

09:14.466 --> 09:16.773
and some millennial pop-tart
with purple hair

09:16.817 --> 09:18.514
going at it
in the back of a cab.

09:18.558 --> 09:20.255
- No.

09:20.298 --> 09:21.256
I thought I'd use it, you know,

09:21.299 --> 09:22.431
to get what he owed me,

09:22.474 --> 09:23.998
but it turns out
I didn't need to.

09:24.041 --> 09:25.608
- That'd be
a great story, Jorge,

09:25.652 --> 09:26.914
if one of
the Hunters' neighbors

09:26.957 --> 09:28.916
didn't see you
and Mrs. Hunter arguing.

09:28.959 --> 09:31.614
- She paid me.
Why would I argue?

09:31.658 --> 09:33.573
No, she was pissed because
I told her the truth

09:33.616 --> 09:35.966
about her sleazebag husband.

09:38.055 --> 09:39.753
- I almost dyed my hair purple
in college.

09:39.796 --> 09:41.450
Oh, yeah?
What were you gonna do?

09:41.493 --> 09:43.104
Audition to be the sixth member
of the Spice Girls?

09:43.147 --> 09:44.627
- I would be
an excellent backup vocalist.

09:44.671 --> 09:48.109
- Eh.
Yeah.

09:48.152 --> 09:49.632
Okay.

09:49.676 --> 09:51.852
Well, Nick traded
over a dozen calls last week

09:51.895 --> 09:53.941
with a girl named
Paisley Ashford.

09:53.984 --> 09:57.553
She works at the Flower Mart
on 18th.

10:00.077 --> 10:01.905
- 'Course I know him.
He's like my boyfriend.

10:01.949 --> 10:03.298
- Well, dumb question:
He ever mention

10:03.341 --> 10:04.778
his wife and kid?

10:04.821 --> 10:06.301
- He talks about Jules and Ruby
all the time.

10:06.344 --> 10:08.608
So sad, what happened to them.

10:10.827 --> 10:12.002
- Yeah.
The car accident?

10:12.046 --> 10:14.178
So tragic, to have
your wife and child

10:14.222 --> 10:15.789
just gone like that.

10:15.832 --> 10:18.748
Told me all about it
on our first date.

10:18.792 --> 10:21.925
- Um, two months ago.

10:21.969 --> 10:23.971
Said he couldn't lie to me.
He still loved her.

10:24.014 --> 10:26.626
Don't meet honest guys
like that every day.

10:26.669 --> 10:29.629
The poor man
actually cried at dinner.

10:32.849 --> 10:36.070
- Who wouldn't fall for
a sweetheart like that?

10:38.159 --> 10:39.726
- So Nick's
a big-time Charlie

10:39.769 --> 10:41.292
at a company called
Big World Consultants.

10:41.336 --> 10:42.990
- Yes and no.

10:43.033 --> 10:44.687
His boss said he was out,
hustling a new client,

10:44.731 --> 10:46.297
but he wasn't sure
which one.

10:46.341 --> 10:47.690
- This could be something.

10:47.734 --> 10:49.692
TARU traced the pings
of Hunter's cell phone.

10:49.736 --> 10:51.389
He was at
the Blue Hill Country Club

10:51.433 --> 10:52.695
at Pearl River the night

10:52.739 --> 10:54.392
before Ruby and Jules
disappeared.

10:54.436 --> 10:56.090
That's--that's 40 minutes
north of the Upper West Side.

10:56.133 --> 10:58.179
- Well, people do play golf,
Amanda.

11:00.877 --> 11:02.487
- One of my cousins
used to live up there.

11:02.531 --> 11:03.793
It was called, uh,

11:03.837 --> 11:04.838
Muddy Creek back in the day

11:04.881 --> 11:06.448
'cause of all the swampland.

11:07.579 --> 11:08.972
- Wait, hold on.
Didn't--

11:09.016 --> 11:12.236
Jules called Nick
on Tuesday night.

11:12.280 --> 11:13.847
- Yeah, but that call

11:13.890 --> 11:16.371
could've easily been placed
from Jules' computer

11:16.414 --> 11:18.068
to make it look like
it was from her cell.

11:18.112 --> 11:19.374
- When we were
at his apartment,

11:19.417 --> 11:21.028
I only noticed one laptop

11:21.071 --> 11:21.898
on Nick's desk.

11:21.942 --> 11:23.421
- And Nick was the only one

11:23.465 --> 11:24.553
who heard his wife

11:24.596 --> 11:25.554
on the other end of that phone,

11:25.597 --> 11:26.903
so...

11:26.947 --> 11:28.905
let's get a team to Pearl River

11:28.949 --> 11:31.691
and... search the swampland.

11:34.519 --> 11:35.825
- Sister's here.

11:38.088 --> 11:40.743
- Sorry I didn't
come in earlier.

11:40.787 --> 11:42.789
At first, I didn't think
Nick had anything to do

11:42.832 --> 11:45.443
with my sister's disappearance.

11:47.924 --> 11:50.405
- I-I've known Nick
since college.

11:50.448 --> 11:52.799
I actually introduced them.

11:52.842 --> 11:54.626
He was that guy.
Most athletic,

11:54.670 --> 11:56.933
most popular,
most likely to be on

11:56.977 --> 11:59.240
the "Forbes" 100 list,

11:59.283 --> 12:02.678
but he has a dark side.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.854
- Okay.

12:04.898 --> 12:06.769
What do you mean by that?

12:06.813 --> 12:08.902
- His mom put him
on a pedestal.

12:08.945 --> 12:11.034
You know, he could do no wrong.

12:11.078 --> 12:13.384
I swear, I think he got married

12:13.428 --> 12:16.779
and had a baby just for her.

12:16.823 --> 12:18.433
It's a lot of pressure,
and when it

12:18.476 --> 12:20.435
gets to be too much...

12:20.478 --> 12:21.653
he snaps.

12:24.178 --> 12:27.485
- He couldn't get tickets
to Springsteen on Broadway.

12:27.529 --> 12:30.793
He smashed the coffee table.
Glass flew everywhere.

12:32.229 --> 12:35.363
- Not that I know of,
but, um...

12:42.109 --> 12:44.111
- Six months ago,
we were at dinner,

12:44.154 --> 12:45.808
and they got into an argument

12:45.852 --> 12:47.810
about something stupid.
Nothing big, like--

12:47.854 --> 12:50.552
like any married couple.
- Sure.

12:50.595 --> 12:52.728
- But later, Nick joked

12:52.772 --> 12:55.687
how his life would be easier
if Jules was dead.

12:57.167 --> 12:59.691
I didn't think he was serious.
I...

12:59.735 --> 13:01.389
I actually laughed.

13:02.999 --> 13:05.175
- Bring him in for a chat.

13:07.134 --> 13:08.526
- Yeah, I was selling
my golf clubs.

13:09.876 --> 13:11.268
- Yeah, I found a buyer
off of Craigslist.

13:11.312 --> 13:13.967
I didn't want a stranger
coming to my house.

13:14.010 --> 13:16.665
- So you meet
a complete stranger

13:16.708 --> 13:19.146
after midnight
at your golf course?

13:19.189 --> 13:22.758
- Well, that's
where my sticks are, so yeah.

13:24.194 --> 13:25.805
- Bob something.
I don't know.

13:25.848 --> 13:28.982
I found him on Craigslist.

13:29.025 --> 13:30.984
- Yeah, they came back.

13:31.027 --> 13:32.942
It's your wife's blood
all over the car,

13:32.986 --> 13:34.857
and your fingerprints
on the steering wheel.

13:36.293 --> 13:38.861
I own the damn car.

13:38.905 --> 13:40.341
- Okay, you should know

13:40.384 --> 13:41.864
we have people
searching that swampland

13:41.908 --> 13:42.996
around the golf course.

13:43.039 --> 13:44.824
- Jesus, you people are sick!

13:44.867 --> 13:47.261
- What's sick
is cheating on your wife.

13:47.304 --> 13:48.697
We spoke to Paisley.

13:48.740 --> 13:50.220
- Oh, come on.

13:50.264 --> 13:51.439
F

13:51.482 --> 13:53.006
- Uh-huh.
- That's nothing.

13:53.049 --> 13:55.182
Look, I--I would've told you
about her, but...

13:55.225 --> 13:57.053
- Your lieutenant

13:57.097 --> 13:59.534
asked me
in front of my mother.

13:59.577 --> 14:01.144
Look, Paisley's nothing.

14:01.188 --> 14:03.755
That is just sex,
and you guys can search

14:03.799 --> 14:05.279
the damn Everglades
if you want to.

14:05.322 --> 14:06.889
You're not gonna find
Jules and Ruby there.

14:06.933 --> 14:09.196
- I don't know!

14:09.239 --> 14:11.241
For Christ sakes,
she called me,

14:11.285 --> 14:13.330
I was on the phone with her,
and she got attacked!

14:13.374 --> 14:15.550
Do you remember that?
- Yeah, I do.

14:15.593 --> 14:17.813
But we think that even a guy
like you has a friend,

14:17.857 --> 14:18.814
and if you don't,
you got enough money

14:18.858 --> 14:20.250
that you can rent one.

14:20.294 --> 14:21.817
All in all, your life
would be a lot easier

14:21.861 --> 14:23.427
if your wife and daughter
were dead.

14:26.996 --> 14:29.781
After you get over this
little speed bump, that is.

14:31.261 --> 14:32.915
- Sherry.

14:35.787 --> 14:37.615
That was a joke.

14:37.659 --> 14:38.965
Okay?
I was pulling Jules' leg.

14:39.008 --> 14:40.575
- Well, you're
a good-looking guy.

14:40.618 --> 14:42.272
Make good money.
I'm sure you--

14:42.316 --> 14:44.013
you've thought about it.
No one nagging you

14:44.057 --> 14:45.928
to go shopping,
load the dishwasher,

14:45.972 --> 14:47.190
keep you from hitting the bars.

14:47.234 --> 14:48.888
I imagine being a bachelor

14:48.931 --> 14:50.411
would be a lot easier

14:50.454 --> 14:52.021
than being chained
to a wife and a kid.

14:52.065 --> 14:53.022
- I don't see you
wearing a ring.

14:53.066 --> 14:55.416
Why don't you tell me?

14:55.459 --> 14:57.635
- Why don't you
tell me something?

14:57.679 --> 14:59.986
Why would you tell Paisley

15:00.029 --> 15:02.989
that Jules and Ruby
were killed in a car accident?

15:04.991 --> 15:06.383
I wanted to get her into bed.

15:06.427 --> 15:07.907
Women think I'm sensitive.
They like that.

15:07.950 --> 15:08.995
Oh, God.

15:09.038 --> 15:10.953
- Fine, I'm a scumbag.
I get it.

15:10.997 --> 15:13.260
But that doesn't mean
I don't love my wife and kid,

15:13.303 --> 15:16.263
and it does not make me
a murderer!

15:19.266 --> 15:21.790
- My mom wonders
why I'm not married.

15:21.833 --> 15:23.531
He could've just divorced her.

15:23.574 --> 15:25.925
- And give up half of
what he's got?

15:28.318 --> 15:30.625
- Look, he's not gonna
give an inch

15:30.668 --> 15:32.322
until we find those bodies.

15:32.366 --> 15:34.020
- And the second
he leaves here,

15:34.063 --> 15:35.630
he's getting on
the first plane.

15:35.673 --> 15:37.501
- Which is why we're not
letting him walk out of here.

15:37.545 --> 15:38.763
A guy like Hunter?

15:38.807 --> 15:40.548
Night in Rikers
should make him talk.

15:40.591 --> 15:42.332
Arrest him for murder.

15:51.994 --> 15:52.429
.

15:52.473 --> 15:54.170
- All right, so nothing so far

15:54.214 --> 15:55.389
from the swamps in Pearl River.

15:55.432 --> 15:57.391
- Yeah, I-I got it.
Thanks.

15:57.434 --> 15:59.088
TARU just sent over
the, uh, video

15:59.132 --> 16:00.960
from the Remington Mall
parking lot.

16:05.268 --> 16:07.140
- That's her car.
11:14 a.m.

16:07.183 --> 16:08.793
- Mm-hm.

16:12.319 --> 16:14.451
There's our guy.

16:14.495 --> 16:16.627
- But no Jules or Ruby.

16:18.803 --> 16:20.980
- Jules' cell phone, purse.

16:23.025 --> 16:24.809
There's another angle.

16:25.810 --> 16:27.595
- Freeze it.

16:27.638 --> 16:29.858
Here, let's blow that up.

16:31.903 --> 16:34.428
We'll run it
through facial recognition.

16:37.083 --> 16:38.475
- Okay, hold on, hold on.

16:38.519 --> 16:41.261
Now, the car had a flat tire,
right?

16:41.304 --> 16:44.090
And we assumed that Jules
used the sealant

16:44.133 --> 16:45.787
to fix it, but given
the shape of that tire,

16:45.830 --> 16:47.615
it would've taken what,
ten miles, tops?

16:47.658 --> 16:49.443
- Mm.
- So what if

16:49.486 --> 16:51.227
it was this mystery man
who bought it

16:51.271 --> 16:53.751
to get himself to the mall
so he could dump the car?

16:53.795 --> 16:55.753
- Okay.
So we check every gas station

16:55.797 --> 16:57.407
within ten miles of the mall.

17:02.108 --> 17:04.284
He would've been here
two days ago.

17:04.327 --> 17:06.025
He--he drove--
- Yeah, Nissan Rogue,

17:06.068 --> 17:07.243
with a flat tire.

17:07.287 --> 17:08.505
He bought a can of sealant.

17:08.549 --> 17:09.680
I was trying to sell him
a used tire,

17:09.724 --> 17:11.334
but he wasn't biting.

17:11.378 --> 17:12.553
- Did he have a woman

17:12.596 --> 17:13.641
or a little girl with him?

17:13.684 --> 17:15.295
- No, he was definitely solo.

17:15.338 --> 17:16.948
- And tell me
he used a credit card.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.651
- Caleb Pierce, 50,
retired Army.

17:23.694 --> 17:26.262
He served at Desert Storm.
After that, he bounced around.

17:26.306 --> 17:28.047
Security guard,
bounty hunter...

17:28.090 --> 17:30.223
No address yet,
but he does work security

17:30.266 --> 17:31.398
at Murray Hill Trust.

17:31.441 --> 17:32.964
- Okay, is there any connection

17:33.008 --> 17:33.878
to Nick Hunter?

17:33.922 --> 17:35.184
- I'm checking his financials,

17:35.228 --> 17:36.272
phone records.
So far, nothing.

17:36.316 --> 17:37.926
- All right, check personal ads

17:37.969 --> 17:39.014
on military websites.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.842
- Hold on.

17:40.885 --> 17:42.496
Jules and Ruby
may not be dead.

17:42.539 --> 17:43.932
- I just got

17:43.975 --> 17:45.542
a credit card receipt
for the day after

17:45.586 --> 17:47.327
Nick reported
his wife missing

17:47.370 --> 17:50.243
This guy Pierce went into
an all-vegan grocery store,

17:50.286 --> 17:52.506
spent over $100 on kid's meals.

17:52.549 --> 17:54.116
And Nick said
Ruby was vegan, right?

17:55.552 --> 17:56.640
- Uh, he works at the, uh,
Corona branch.

17:56.684 --> 17:58.642
- Well, we are going to Queens.

17:58.686 --> 17:59.904
- I'll check the military ads.

17:59.948 --> 18:02.559
- Stay up on those guys
at Pearl River.

18:06.476 --> 18:07.912
- It's always the guys who...

18:07.956 --> 18:10.045
look like they got it
going on, you know,?

18:10.089 --> 18:11.655
My, uh...

18:11.699 --> 18:14.049
My sister Jeanie used to live
with this guy Johnny.

18:14.093 --> 18:17.008
He was a... He was a dentist,
of all things.

18:17.052 --> 18:19.620
Johnny used to make
these homemade pies

18:19.663 --> 18:21.187
and bring them to Thanksgiving,
you know?

18:21.230 --> 18:23.102
We would, like, watch
the baseball game together.

18:23.145 --> 18:25.060
Like he was a part
of the family forever.

18:25.104 --> 18:28.150
- With three other women.

18:29.412 --> 18:31.414
- Right.

18:32.850 --> 18:34.461
Hey.

18:36.811 --> 18:40.119
Well, I can't say
that I'm upset.

18:42.077 --> 18:43.687
Yeah. Thank you.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.821
That was Rollins.

18:46.864 --> 18:49.563
Nick Hunter got roughed up
last night at Rikers.

18:49.606 --> 18:52.609
- We reap what we sow.

19:02.141 --> 19:03.707
- That's him.

19:10.975 --> 19:13.761
- All right, Mr. Pierce.
Take us to the promised land.

19:19.636 --> 19:26.904
â™ª

19:58.327 --> 19:59.937
- Hold on.

20:18.217 --> 20:25.224
â™ª

20:45.809 --> 20:47.202
What is this?

20:47.246 --> 20:49.770
They don't look like
they're being kidnapped.

20:52.251 --> 20:54.644
What should I do, Loo?

20:55.384 --> 20:57.560
Loo?
- H-hold on.

20:58.909 --> 21:01.216
- Oh, my God,
that's Alex Cabot.

21:01.260 --> 21:08.267
â™ª

21:10.225 --> 21:11.879
- I thought you moved
to Florida,

21:11.922 --> 21:13.968
like the rest of
the retired ADAs.

21:14.011 --> 21:15.883
- Florida makes my hair frizzy.
- Yeah, well, who wants

21:15.926 --> 21:17.363
a kidnapper with frizzy hair?

21:17.406 --> 21:18.625
- No one's being kidnapped.

21:18.668 --> 21:20.191
I only help people
who want to be helped.

21:20.235 --> 21:22.759
- Yeah, like Jules
and Ruby Hunter?

21:24.935 --> 21:28.069
Ruby is four years old, Alex.

21:28.112 --> 21:30.637
At the very minimum,
you're an accomplice

21:30.680 --> 21:32.029
to kidnapping.

21:32.073 --> 21:33.988
- I'm helping them start
an extended vacation.

21:34.031 --> 21:36.686
- You faked their deaths.
You planted evidence.

21:36.730 --> 21:38.209
- Technically, the cops
misread the facts.

21:38.253 --> 21:40.560
- Don't play games with me,
Alex, please.

21:40.603 --> 21:42.170
- They were abused.

21:42.213 --> 21:45.347
I do what I have to do.
- Jesus.

21:45.391 --> 21:47.262
- Alex, Nick Hunter

21:47.306 --> 21:49.220
is sitting at Rikers,

21:49.264 --> 21:51.919
charged with murdering
his wife and his daughter.

21:51.962 --> 21:54.138
- It's not like
he doesn't deserve it.

21:55.096 --> 21:57.272
- How many husbands are--
are sitting in prison

21:57.316 --> 22:00.144
because you decided to take
the law into your own hands?

22:00.188 --> 22:02.059
- The law cannot
protect these women.

22:02.103 --> 22:04.627
- Yes, and nobody knows that
better than I do!

22:04.671 --> 22:06.150
I live there!

22:09.328 --> 22:11.591
Look, we've both seen abuse.

22:11.634 --> 22:14.681
We--we put abusers
in prison.

22:14.724 --> 22:17.901
- What about the ones
we couldn't?

22:19.294 --> 22:21.427
- You can't
break the law, Alex.

22:23.907 --> 22:28.782
- Because it makes you
a criminal, that's why.

22:34.048 --> 22:36.485
- Before I do anything,
I'm gonna speak

22:36.529 --> 22:38.792
with Jules Hunter.

22:45.581 --> 22:45.799
.

22:45.842 --> 22:48.105
- I just needed him
to believe I was dead.

22:48.149 --> 22:49.106
I don't want him to go to jail.

22:49.150 --> 22:52.109
- But he hurt you.

22:52.153 --> 22:53.763
- Yes, but then he'd apologize.

22:53.807 --> 22:56.375
- And swear that
he'd never do it again.

22:56.418 --> 22:58.594
- Tell her about dinner
at the Four Seasons.

23:00.379 --> 23:03.033
- Um, it was my birthday.

23:03.077 --> 23:04.948
We had the Chateaubriand
for two

23:04.992 --> 23:07.516
and a fancy bottle of Margaux.

23:07.560 --> 23:09.518
He was so sweet.

23:09.562 --> 23:11.215
- Until...

23:15.785 --> 23:17.047
- While we were waiting
for dessert,

23:17.091 --> 23:19.049
I went to the ladies' room.

23:19.093 --> 23:20.355
Uh, when I got back to
the table,

23:20.399 --> 23:21.661
I realized I forgot my purse,

23:21.704 --> 23:23.271
so I went back to get it.

23:23.314 --> 23:26.709
Nicholas thought I went back
to flirt with the waiter.

23:26.753 --> 23:28.711
We skipped dessert.

23:28.755 --> 23:30.757
When we were outside, he...

23:33.063 --> 23:35.152
slammed me against
the hood of the car.

23:35.196 --> 23:37.067
- She got a concussion.
- Okay, did you

23:37.111 --> 23:39.113
go to the hospital?

23:40.549 --> 23:42.551
- Mommy, I wanna go home.

23:42.595 --> 23:45.249
Mommy's talking.
Go watch TV.

23:49.732 --> 23:51.168
I went to St. Vincent's.

23:51.212 --> 23:52.518
- She told them that
she hit her head

23:52.561 --> 23:54.781
while she was cleaning
her kitchen cabinets.

23:54.824 --> 23:57.566
- Once, I brought up

23:57.610 --> 24:00.221
divorce...

24:00.264 --> 24:01.962
but Nick threw a glass at me.

24:02.005 --> 24:04.094
- Okay.

24:04.138 --> 24:05.966
Okay.

24:06.009 --> 24:09.230
So... why now?

24:12.668 --> 24:16.019
- I overslept
one day last week.

24:16.063 --> 24:19.762
I didn't make Nick breakfast.

24:19.806 --> 24:21.285
He made his own coffee,

24:21.329 --> 24:23.462
and he woke me up
by pouring it on me.

24:30.556 --> 24:33.646
I told the doctor I spilled
a pot of boiling soup.

24:38.346 --> 24:39.826
- You did good.

24:43.264 --> 24:45.309
- Betty Bluestone.

24:45.353 --> 24:47.616
It was a case I had
about five years ago.

24:47.660 --> 24:49.357
Her husband, Mitch,
used her face

24:49.400 --> 24:51.228
like a leg of lamb
in a "Rocky" movie.

24:51.272 --> 24:53.317
I filed charges,

24:53.361 --> 24:55.711
and Betty fell apart
on the stand.

24:58.192 --> 25:00.107
- So the happy couple
goes home,

25:00.150 --> 25:01.195
and he blows her brains out

25:01.238 --> 25:03.806
on the bathroom tile.

25:03.850 --> 25:05.547
I did my job,

25:05.591 --> 25:07.027
and in the end,
all I did for Betty

25:07.070 --> 25:08.158
was delay the inevitable.

25:08.202 --> 25:09.769
- So you decided
to take matters

25:09.812 --> 25:11.553
into your own hands.

25:11.597 --> 25:14.513
- So I started volunteering
at a women's shelter,

25:14.556 --> 25:16.515
and it grew from there.

25:16.558 --> 25:18.168
- How many women
have you disappeared?

25:18.212 --> 25:20.214
- Hundreds.

25:20.257 --> 25:21.563
It's not just me.

25:21.607 --> 25:22.999
You wouldn't believe how deep

25:23.043 --> 25:24.261
and far this network goes.

25:24.305 --> 25:26.437
- Alex, this is cruel.

25:26.481 --> 25:28.788
These women--their--
their families,

25:28.831 --> 25:31.355
their friends think that
they've been murdered.

25:31.399 --> 25:33.836
- No, no, every case
is different.

25:33.880 --> 25:36.230
In Jules' case,
death was the only way

25:36.273 --> 25:38.449
Nick Hunter was ever gonna
let her leave.

25:40.582 --> 25:42.279
- Jules and Ruby
stay in the safe house

25:42.323 --> 25:43.803
until we can find
suitable relocation.

25:43.846 --> 25:46.457
New names, new IDs--

25:46.501 --> 25:47.850
- They are, figuratively.

25:47.894 --> 25:49.025
- Only her husband

25:49.069 --> 25:50.113
is on trial

25:50.157 --> 25:52.638
for literally killing them.

25:53.726 --> 25:55.292
Alex,

25:55.336 --> 25:57.512
I can't let that happen.

25:59.035 --> 26:00.297
- If you can hold Nick

26:00.341 --> 26:04.127
until we are able
to move them...

26:04.171 --> 26:06.216
If you're uncomfortable
holding him for murder,

26:06.260 --> 26:07.522
reduce the charges.

26:07.566 --> 26:09.219
By the time he files
a motion to dismiss,

26:09.263 --> 26:11.613
Jules and Ruby
will have disappeared.

26:11.657 --> 26:13.397
You're not breaking
the law, Olivia.

26:13.441 --> 26:15.748
You're using it
to save Jules' life.

26:23.973 --> 26:26.715
- I reduced the charges
against Nick Hunter to assault.

26:26.759 --> 26:28.587
He made bail and limped
out of the courtroom.

26:28.630 --> 26:30.893
- I heard about
the fun times at Rikers.

26:32.634 --> 26:34.593
- Apparently, you didn't
hear about this.

26:42.252 --> 26:44.080
- You, me, the department,

26:44.124 --> 26:45.429
the DA's office, and the city,

26:45.473 --> 26:47.040
for $50 million.

26:47.083 --> 26:49.085
He's claiming false arrest,
negligence,

26:49.129 --> 26:51.435
intentional infliction
of emotional distress,

26:51.479 --> 26:53.046
and to top it off,
we all joined hands

26:53.089 --> 26:54.743
to violate his civil rights.

26:57.224 --> 26:59.661
- Unfortunately, it is.

26:59.705 --> 27:02.272
He made a motion
for accelerated discovery.

27:02.316 --> 27:05.275
The bad news:
it was granted.

27:05.319 --> 27:06.842
The terrible news, Liv:

27:06.886 --> 27:08.714
you're first up
to be deposed.

27:16.243 --> 27:17.548
- Because in most abductions,

27:17.592 --> 27:19.681
if--if there's no ransom note

27:19.725 --> 27:21.465
within the first 24 hours,

27:21.509 --> 27:24.512
then we suspect the worst.

27:24.555 --> 27:26.470
- Please describe
the physical evidence

27:26.514 --> 27:27.907
that convinced you
to arrest Mr. Hunter

27:27.950 --> 27:29.778
for the murder
of his wife and child.

27:29.822 --> 27:31.258
- There was blood

27:31.301 --> 27:32.955
in Mrs. Hunter's abandoned car.

27:32.999 --> 27:34.478
- So you said.

27:34.522 --> 27:35.958
Any evidence how it got there?

27:36.002 --> 27:37.699
- We assumed that
there was a struggle.

27:37.743 --> 27:39.832
- No.

27:39.875 --> 27:41.660
- That's because the bodies
of Mrs. Hunter and her daughter

27:41.703 --> 27:43.487
were never found.

27:43.531 --> 27:44.880
- That is correct.

27:44.924 --> 27:46.665
- So I can assume
that you eventually realized

27:46.708 --> 27:48.667
that the arrest for murder
was a mistake.

27:48.710 --> 27:51.495
- You can't
assume anything, counselor,

27:51.539 --> 27:54.324
even if this is
just a deposition.

27:54.368 --> 27:55.630
- All right, fine.

27:55.674 --> 27:56.936
So we sit here today,
lieutenant.

27:56.979 --> 27:58.502
Do you believe that
arresting Mr. Hunter

27:58.546 --> 28:00.417
on double murder was a mistake?

28:00.461 --> 28:01.897
- I know

28:01.941 --> 28:04.595
that Mr. Hunter
abused his wife.

28:04.639 --> 28:06.380
- That is slander!
That is completely false--

28:06.423 --> 28:07.773
- Shut up, Nick.
Shut up.

28:07.816 --> 28:09.688
How do you know that,
lieutenant?

28:12.342 --> 28:14.518
- Because I've worked at SVU

28:14.562 --> 28:17.565
for 19 years.

28:17.608 --> 28:18.871
- That's not good enough.

28:24.137 --> 28:25.312
Now let me ask you this.

28:25.355 --> 28:27.357
Do you now know for a fact

28:27.401 --> 28:28.707
that arresting Mr. Hunter

28:28.750 --> 28:31.013
for murder was a mistake?

28:38.107 --> 28:39.543
Yes.

28:44.853 --> 28:46.028
- Well, there's only one reason
why you would

28:46.072 --> 28:47.203
reduce the charges,

28:47.247 --> 28:48.465
as opposed to...

28:48.509 --> 28:50.946
dropping them altogether.

28:50.990 --> 28:53.732
She told you
she was abused, didn't she?

28:56.430 --> 28:57.910
They're alive, aren't they?

29:01.087 --> 29:03.132
Mrs. Hunter and Ruby--
they're still alive.

29:03.176 --> 29:04.699
- Objection.

29:10.226 --> 29:13.621
- Have you spoken
to Mrs. Hunter, lieutenant?

29:22.325 --> 29:22.499
.

29:22.543 --> 29:24.937
- You could have lied, Liv!
- No, I couldn't have.

29:24.980 --> 29:26.155
I was under oath.

29:26.199 --> 29:27.374
You thought God
would smite you?

29:27.417 --> 29:28.941
It is a fiction, Olivia.

29:28.984 --> 29:30.464
This entire
"tell the whole truth

29:30.507 --> 29:32.205
and nothing but the truth"
is a load of crap

29:32.248 --> 29:34.120
that we tell people
so that they think

29:34.163 --> 29:36.078
the criminal justice system
gives a damn about them.

29:36.122 --> 29:37.601
Who did what,
who did what to whom...

29:39.516 --> 29:41.605
- I opened my eyes.

29:41.649 --> 29:44.826
I opened them wide,
and I saw that for 12 years,

29:44.870 --> 29:47.829
I was a cog in a
holier-than-thou wheel,

29:47.873 --> 29:49.135
and the wheel
just keeps spinning

29:49.178 --> 29:51.006
and tossing off bodies
as it goes.

29:51.050 --> 29:53.052
Some remain standing,
some fall.

29:53.095 --> 29:55.184
Nobody cares.
Nobody gives a damn,

29:55.228 --> 29:56.707
as long as the wheel
keeps turning.

29:56.751 --> 29:58.971
- And we keep going.
It's what we do.

29:59.014 --> 30:01.582
- It's all we have,

30:01.625 --> 30:04.106
and if we don't,
then we're just like they are.

30:04.150 --> 30:06.326
- When you throw a wife-beater
on that wheel,

30:06.369 --> 30:08.154
you pray for a little bit
of justice,

30:08.197 --> 30:10.634
but more often than not,
he walks.

30:10.678 --> 30:13.463
They're a little wobbly,
but they go away free.

30:13.507 --> 30:15.814
I prefer to avoid
the wheel altogether.

30:15.857 --> 30:17.728
That way, I ensure
it is the victim

30:17.772 --> 30:19.948
who walks away.

30:19.992 --> 30:21.907
I know you, Olivia.

30:21.950 --> 30:24.387
I know you want
to do the right thing.

30:24.431 --> 30:25.911
Sometimes,
doing the right thing

30:25.954 --> 30:27.869
means not pawning
a woman's future

30:27.913 --> 30:29.871
off on 12 indifferent citizens

30:29.915 --> 30:31.525
and a gray hair
in a robe.

30:31.568 --> 30:33.832
- No, everything's fine, Jules.

30:33.875 --> 30:35.050
Pack your bags.
We're going.

30:35.094 --> 30:36.878
- You know that I cannot
let that happen.

30:36.922 --> 30:38.184
Jules?

30:38.227 --> 30:41.535
Jules, Nick knows
that you're here.

30:41.578 --> 30:43.754
Okay, he's--he's probably
on his way right now.

30:43.798 --> 30:44.930
- If Nick knows
that she's here,

30:44.973 --> 30:46.322
we can't--not just Jules
is leaving.

30:46.366 --> 30:48.542
We all need to leave.
- If you leave,

30:48.585 --> 30:50.631
you're gonna lose Ruby.

30:50.674 --> 30:51.937
- Nick will never find you.

30:51.980 --> 30:54.504
- He will have the FBI
looking for you.

30:54.548 --> 30:55.897
Private investigators.

30:55.941 --> 30:57.812
Me, Jules.
I've already found you once.

30:57.856 --> 30:58.813
- I don't know.
Nick will never--

30:58.857 --> 30:59.901
- So you're gonna

30:59.945 --> 31:01.294
fight him in court.

31:01.337 --> 31:03.035
You're gonna serve him
with divorce papers

31:03.078 --> 31:05.951
asking for sole custody
of Ruby.

31:05.994 --> 31:08.257
Your defense attorney
is gonna write you

31:08.301 --> 31:10.390
one hell of a complaint,
and when you win,

31:10.433 --> 31:12.871
you will be free
to go anywhere you want, Jules,

31:12.914 --> 31:15.090
and I'm gonna help you.

31:21.749 --> 31:23.490
- He poured coffee on me

31:23.533 --> 31:25.927
and told me
I was a lazy slob.

31:27.798 --> 31:30.627
- No.
I started to, but...

31:30.671 --> 31:31.933
I was scared.

31:34.414 --> 31:36.938
- No, but

31:36.982 --> 31:39.985
once, she was
watching "Frozen."

31:40.028 --> 31:42.204
It was too loud for Nick.

31:42.248 --> 31:45.642
He asked her to shut it off,
but she made it louder.

31:45.686 --> 31:47.993
She was just playing.
She's only four.

31:49.472 --> 31:51.735
- He grabbed the remote
and threw it.

31:51.779 --> 31:53.650
It just missed Ruby's head.

31:53.694 --> 31:56.523
I took Ruby to the bathroom
and locked the door,

31:56.566 --> 31:59.874
and he started pounding
on the door,

31:59.918 --> 32:02.224
demanding we come out.

32:02.268 --> 32:05.358
I waited until he calmed down.

32:05.401 --> 32:07.229
I don't know
what he would've done.

32:07.273 --> 32:09.318
- Who has custody
of your daughter now?

32:09.362 --> 32:11.799
- Child Welfare has placed her
in a foster home,

32:11.842 --> 32:14.062
pending resolution
of this matter.

32:14.106 --> 32:15.803
Thank you.

32:15.846 --> 32:19.502
- Mrs. Hunter, I counted
12 separate allegations

32:19.546 --> 32:22.157
of domestic violence,
which is horrible,

32:22.201 --> 32:24.812
if it's true.

32:24.855 --> 32:26.335
After this

32:26.379 --> 32:29.295
alleged incidence
of domestic violence,

32:29.338 --> 32:31.427
did you go to the ER?

32:31.471 --> 32:33.821
- Yes.
- And you're aware

32:33.864 --> 32:35.127
that the law requires

32:35.170 --> 32:36.867
a medical professional

32:36.911 --> 32:38.957
to alert the police

32:39.000 --> 32:40.132
if there's any evidence

32:40.175 --> 32:42.699
of domestic violence?

32:42.743 --> 32:46.181
- I never told them
what happened.

32:46.225 --> 32:48.792
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

32:48.836 --> 32:49.924
You lied to them?

32:49.968 --> 32:51.056
- Objection!

32:51.099 --> 32:52.535
- I'm sure you're aware

32:52.579 --> 32:54.537
of the latest trend
in divorce proceedings,

32:54.581 --> 32:57.018
especially if the custody
of a minor is an issue,

32:57.062 --> 32:58.672
is to claim domestic violence,

32:58.715 --> 33:00.674
but what am I saying?
Of course you're aware.

33:00.717 --> 33:03.807
That's why we're here.
- That's enough, counselor.

33:03.851 --> 33:06.419
- I'm just saying.

33:06.462 --> 33:08.725
The truth is,

33:08.769 --> 33:10.814
you never told anybody

33:10.858 --> 33:12.773
about this alleged abuse

33:12.816 --> 33:14.470
until you decided

33:14.514 --> 33:16.864
you would prefer
to raise Ruby on your own.

33:16.907 --> 33:18.561
Isn't that true?

33:29.442 --> 33:30.704
- Not a pretty sight.

33:30.747 --> 33:32.227
- Yeah, well, family court
never is.

33:32.271 --> 33:33.881
Look, bring the SUV
around the back,

33:33.924 --> 33:35.535
and I'll bring Jules down
when she's done with Alex.

33:35.578 --> 33:36.884
- You want me to wait with her
at the hotel?

33:36.927 --> 33:38.059
- No, no, no.
I, uh--

33:38.103 --> 33:39.191
just get her settled in.

33:39.234 --> 33:40.627
I got a couple of unis
assigned

33:40.670 --> 33:41.715
to sit outside her door.

33:41.758 --> 33:45.632
It shouldn't be long.
- All right.

33:47.547 --> 33:49.157
- It's not as bad
as you think.

33:49.201 --> 33:50.593
I know Judge Martinez

33:50.637 --> 33:52.117
from the Women's Legal
Momentum Fund.

33:52.160 --> 33:53.466
She's smart, she's fair.

33:53.509 --> 33:54.684
I guarantee you,
she's not gonna fall

33:54.728 --> 33:55.903
for Biegel's nonsense.

33:55.946 --> 33:57.557
And more importantly,

33:57.600 --> 33:59.515
tomorrow, I'm going to
put Dr. Young,

33:59.559 --> 34:00.995
who is the best family
therapist

34:01.039 --> 34:02.083
in the city, by the way,

34:02.127 --> 34:03.389
on the stand.

34:03.432 --> 34:05.130
She is going to testify
how abused women

34:05.173 --> 34:06.392
suffer in silence,

34:06.435 --> 34:08.089
how their egos,
their self-esteem,

34:08.133 --> 34:10.831
their general sense of worth,
is completely eroded over time.

34:10.874 --> 34:13.790
- You like being back in court,
don't you?

34:14.965 --> 34:16.532
- Dr. Young will also testify

34:16.576 --> 34:18.186
that after talking to Ruby...

34:18.230 --> 34:19.927
- Jules should receive
full custody.

34:19.970 --> 34:21.711
- Sorry.
Hey.

34:23.365 --> 34:25.759
What?
W

34:25.802 --> 34:28.109
Where?

34:28.153 --> 34:29.415
I'm on my way.

34:29.458 --> 34:30.894
- Sounds like bad news.

34:30.938 --> 34:32.244
- Yeah.
I've, uh--

34:32.287 --> 34:33.593
I've had better.
I--

34:33.636 --> 34:35.464
- Go, go, I got this.
- Okay.

34:35.508 --> 34:37.292
- But it's on you
when we win.

34:45.605 --> 34:47.302
- Carisi.
I couldn't--

34:47.346 --> 34:48.912
I couldn't stop the car.
I tried--

34:48.956 --> 34:50.218
- Okay, calm down.
Take it easy.

34:50.262 --> 34:51.219
- He just blew through
the stop sign.

34:52.699 --> 34:54.440
- He's in the wind.

34:54.483 --> 34:57.704
- Hey.
Did you see him?

34:57.747 --> 34:59.227
- He, um,

34:59.271 --> 35:01.795
had a b--a baseball cap.

35:01.838 --> 35:03.231
And I--I tr--

35:03.275 --> 35:06.452
I tried to, uh...

35:06.495 --> 35:07.627
I...

35:07.670 --> 35:09.281
I couldn't.
I couldn't st--

35:09.324 --> 35:11.109
I c--
I couldn't stop the bleeding.

35:11.152 --> 35:12.632
- I know.

35:12.675 --> 35:14.503
I know.

35:17.724 --> 35:19.378
- I called in the plates.
Vehicle was stolen

35:19.421 --> 35:21.815
two days ago
from Short Hills.

35:23.686 --> 35:24.818
- Oh, dear God.

35:27.864 --> 35:29.823
He's responsible.

35:32.695 --> 35:34.175
- Can you think of a better way

35:34.219 --> 35:36.351
to get sole custody
of your daughter?

35:49.495 --> 35:49.886
.

35:49.930 --> 35:52.150
- We never should've
brought her back!

35:52.193 --> 35:53.368
- For God's sake, Alex,
I followed the law.

35:53.412 --> 35:54.543
- And it got her killed!

35:54.587 --> 35:55.631
- You cannot be serious.

35:55.675 --> 35:57.242
- That man belonged in prison.

35:57.285 --> 35:58.547
- This is America, Alex.

35:58.591 --> 36:00.288
You can't lock someone up

36:00.332 --> 36:02.072
without proof.

36:02.116 --> 36:04.162
- You saw her burns, Olivia!

36:04.205 --> 36:06.468
He brutalized her!
- Right!

36:06.512 --> 36:07.817
And he made bail

36:07.861 --> 36:09.428
on the assault charges.

36:09.471 --> 36:10.994
That is his right.

36:11.038 --> 36:12.257
But maybe with
your new mission,

36:12.300 --> 36:13.606
you're too busy
to keep up with

36:13.649 --> 36:14.868
the Eighth Amendment.

36:14.911 --> 36:16.304
- I can't believe
you're even starting--

36:16.348 --> 36:17.784
- Not now--
- I didn't want to interrupt,

36:17.827 --> 36:19.699
but the AIS report came back.

36:27.228 --> 36:29.752
- There's no skid marks
whatsoever.

36:33.365 --> 36:36.803
They estimate that
the other SUV was

36:36.846 --> 36:39.719
moving faster than
55 miles per hour.

36:46.160 --> 36:47.988
- Your gut may have been right.

36:48.031 --> 36:49.772
Might have been a hit.

36:55.909 --> 36:59.347
- So I want to know
everything that Nick Hunter

36:59.391 --> 37:02.698
has done since
Jules came back to the city.

37:02.742 --> 37:05.962
Credit cards, phone calls...

37:08.095 --> 37:10.228
his conversations
on the street.

37:16.843 --> 37:19.019
- Put this prick away, Liv.

37:25.373 --> 37:27.201
- No, it was my decision

37:27.245 --> 37:28.768
to charge Mr. Hunter
with murder.

37:28.811 --> 37:31.031
- Were you aware
of any physical evidence

37:31.074 --> 37:32.598
indicating that my client

37:32.641 --> 37:34.469
would murder
his wife and child?

37:34.513 --> 37:35.905
- No.
- Then what were

37:35.949 --> 37:37.080
the determining factors

37:37.124 --> 37:38.691
that led you
to your decision?

37:38.734 --> 37:41.563
- Mr. Hunter's attitude.

37:41.607 --> 37:43.130
- Please be more specific.

37:43.173 --> 37:45.959
- Kind of the way he is now.

37:46.002 --> 37:47.743
A man who gave
a damn about his wife

37:47.787 --> 37:49.267
would've postponed
this deposition

37:49.310 --> 37:51.878
until after her body
was in the ground.

37:51.921 --> 37:53.488
You know, I'm sorry
for your loss.

37:53.532 --> 37:54.533
Screw you.

37:54.576 --> 37:55.969
I got beat up in prison

37:56.012 --> 37:57.492
because you don't know
what you're doing.

37:57.536 --> 37:58.754
- Apparently, you did.

37:58.798 --> 37:59.973
- What are you
implying here, huh?

38:00.016 --> 38:01.366
- Take it easy, Nick.

38:01.409 --> 38:03.106
- You wanted your wife dead.
Now she is.

38:03.150 --> 38:04.020
- You...

38:04.064 --> 38:05.979
- Take a deep breath.

38:08.155 --> 38:10.549
The hell with this.

38:10.592 --> 38:11.985
I am entitled

38:12.028 --> 38:13.769
to that money,
and I deserve it,

38:13.813 --> 38:16.119
the sooner the better.
Every damn penny.

38:29.829 --> 38:31.352
- Hey.

38:31.396 --> 38:32.875
How's Carisi?

38:32.919 --> 38:34.312
- He's a little wobbly

38:34.355 --> 38:35.182
a lot guilty,

38:35.225 --> 38:37.358
but he'll survive 'em both.

38:37.402 --> 38:39.578
- Any luck connecting
Nick Hunter to the accident?

38:39.621 --> 38:40.927
- At the time of the collision,

38:40.970 --> 38:43.277
uh, Nick Hunter
was at a cafÃ©

38:43.321 --> 38:45.845
on the Upper West Side
with a co-worker.

38:45.888 --> 38:47.150
- His next mistress.

38:47.194 --> 38:48.804
- Yeah.
It's all on the

38:48.848 --> 38:50.066
restaurant video,

38:50.110 --> 38:51.503
so we're checking
phone records

38:51.546 --> 38:52.547
emails, financials,

38:52.591 --> 38:54.244
but I'm not hopeful.

38:55.289 --> 38:57.117
This guy might actually
get away with it.

38:57.160 --> 38:58.771
- And receive
a lovely parting gift

38:58.814 --> 39:00.250
of $50 million.

39:02.035 --> 39:04.646
- Well,

39:04.690 --> 39:05.778
the good news, the civil courts

39:05.821 --> 39:07.475
aren't what you'd call quick,

39:07.519 --> 39:10.783
and the city's attorneys
know how to delay.

39:10.826 --> 39:13.133
Still sucks.
I know.

39:13.176 --> 39:16.354
- Every second that this guy's
not in prison...

39:18.921 --> 39:21.315
- Yeah, well,

39:21.359 --> 39:24.884
tomorrow, you and I will
get up,

39:24.927 --> 39:27.016
brush our teeth,
comb our hair,

39:27.060 --> 39:29.671
and go after
another bad guy.

39:29.715 --> 39:31.543
- Makes you want
to oversleep.

39:34.459 --> 39:36.025
- Look, I don't know
if it means anything,

39:36.069 --> 39:37.636
but I didn't envy
your decision

39:37.679 --> 39:39.377
about bringing
Jules Hunter back.

39:41.727 --> 39:45.078
- Well, I--I did
what I needed to do.

39:50.431 --> 39:51.911
It's easier if you
take yourself

39:51.954 --> 39:52.999
out of the equation.

39:53.042 --> 39:55.044
You know?

39:55.088 --> 40:00.049
Your sense of
justice, morality,

40:00.093 --> 40:03.270
superego--

40:03.313 --> 40:05.620
whatever you want to call it.

40:14.716 --> 40:16.849
- You made
the right decision.

40:16.892 --> 40:19.721
- And what if I decided
to stop the meds?

40:19.765 --> 40:21.070
- Well, then,

40:21.114 --> 40:23.029
that would've been
the right decision.

40:23.072 --> 40:24.639
Sometimes,
the only wrong decision

40:24.683 --> 40:26.554
is to do nothing.

40:26.598 --> 40:28.382
- You mind if I--I just
sit with her for a while?

40:28.426 --> 40:30.297
- No, please, help yourself.

40:50.709 --> 40:53.015
- Thanks for agreeing
to meet me out here.

40:53.059 --> 40:54.277
I have to pick up
another woman.

40:54.321 --> 40:56.236
- I don't want to know.

40:56.279 --> 40:59.457
- Judge Martinez granted Nick
custody of Ruby.

40:59.500 --> 41:00.588
- You're kidding.

41:00.632 --> 41:03.025
- He's still her father.

41:03.069 --> 41:05.288
- And the wheel goes round.

41:05.332 --> 41:07.595
- That's what I've been saying.

41:07.639 --> 41:09.379
Sherry, Jules' sister,

41:09.423 --> 41:10.772
is fighting for
custody of Ruby.

41:12.121 --> 41:15.081
- Do you want to know
the truth?

41:15.124 --> 41:17.126
- You know, today, on the--

41:17.170 --> 41:18.388
I was on the subway platform,

41:18.432 --> 41:20.869
and I saw
these two cockroaches,

41:20.913 --> 41:23.089
and they were pulling
at different ends

41:23.132 --> 41:25.570
of a crust of bread.

41:25.613 --> 41:27.702
And then the bread tore,

41:27.746 --> 41:29.443
and it fell onto the tracks,

41:29.487 --> 41:30.488
and--

41:30.531 --> 41:32.707
and neither bug
got their dinner.

41:34.230 --> 41:36.319
- Are you proposing
we work together?

41:38.017 --> 41:41.020
- I could never do
what you do, Alex.

41:41.934 --> 41:43.631
- And I can't stop.

41:57.993 --> 41:59.517
- Take care.

41:59.560 --> 42:01.301
- Okay.
