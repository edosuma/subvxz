00:33.818 --> 00:36.654
Troy. Troy, you ready?
Is your game done?

00:36.688 --> 00:38.322
I already started a new one.

00:38.355 --> 00:40.224
A new one?

00:40.257 --> 00:42.594
Dude, I haven't even finished
playing your last game yet.

00:42.627 --> 00:45.295
Look, let's put the games
on the app store, right?

00:45.329 --> 00:47.765
I'll make the promo videos.
We'll get rich.

00:47.799 --> 00:50.267
And then girls? Huh?

00:50.300 --> 00:52.236
- Hey, ladies!
- Nope.

00:52.269 --> 00:54.338
Nick, you know
it's not about the girls, man.

00:54.371 --> 00:57.407
It's about making one great game
and showing it off at Pixelcon.

00:57.441 --> 00:59.611
Yeah, like... like your dad did.

01:02.714 --> 01:03.648
All right, fine, fine.

01:03.681 --> 01:05.583
Let me at least show
my Nickalicious channel?

01:05.617 --> 01:07.217
I mean, look,
the Nickheads would love it.

01:07.251 --> 01:08.620
I thought they were
the Nickelodeons?

01:08.653 --> 01:10.755
Yeah, copyright problems, so...

01:10.788 --> 01:12.590
We're still workshopping it.

01:12.624 --> 01:15.158
Please, let me show them?

01:15.192 --> 01:16.260
Okay.

01:16.293 --> 01:18.128
- Really?
- No.

01:18.161 --> 01:19.396
Can I at least show my mom?

<i>I love making video games.</i>

02:15.620 --> 02:18.188
<i>I always have.</i>

02:24.361 --> 02:27.665
<i>But for some reason my mom

02:27.699 --> 02:30.133

in Mr. Diehl's</i>

02:30.167 --> 02:32.402
<i>tenth grade
computer science class,</i>

02:32.436 --> 02:34.304
<i>coding... this.</i>

02:36.708 --> 02:40.612
Okay, ten minutes.
Ten minutes!

02:40.645 --> 02:41.913
It's the moment I find out

02:41.946 --> 02:43.781
if I'm a good teacher or not.

02:43.815 --> 02:45.917
Dude, we need your help!

02:45.950 --> 02:49.687
They come to him for help
in their darkest hour...

02:49.721 --> 02:50.888
Do you have any idea
what's going on?

02:50.922 --> 02:51.723
Come on, Troy.

02:51.756 --> 02:52.857
This doesn't
make any sense to us.

02:52.890 --> 02:57.562
I thought you guys said
you wanted to do it on your own.

02:57.595 --> 02:58.663
- And done.
- I think I broke it.

02:58.696 --> 03:00.263
We need your help, Troy.

03:00.297 --> 03:02.934
This is worth half your grade.

03:02.967 --> 03:04.234
Five minutes!

03:04.267 --> 03:05.435
That was not five minutes.

03:05.470 --> 03:06.804
Time flies
when you're having fun.

03:06.838 --> 03:08.506
Two minutes!

03:08.539 --> 03:09.841
What...

03:09.874 --> 03:11.676
A or F. That's what
you're gonna get.

03:11.709 --> 03:15.245
I just decided that
because I'm crazy AF.

03:16.648 --> 03:18.583
Five...

03:18.616 --> 03:20.551
four...

03:20.585 --> 03:21.953
three...

03:21.986 --> 03:24.221
two...

03:24.254 --> 03:25.857
one!

03:29.226 --> 03:32.229
You're a genius.
You should work at EA or Xodus.

03:32.262 --> 03:33.363
Xodus sucks.

03:33.397 --> 03:35.900
I'm sorry to interrupt
but I need to talk to Troy.

03:35.933 --> 03:37.367
Namaste, everyone.

03:37.401 --> 03:39.871
Uh, namaste,
Vice Principal Goodson.

03:39.904 --> 03:41.204
Namaste.

03:41.238 --> 03:42.840
Namaste?

03:42.874 --> 03:44.709
That's good,
that's good.

03:44.742 --> 03:45.576
Laugh at me again

03:45.610 --> 03:47.612
and I will dog walk
every one of you!

03:49.246 --> 03:51.248
Is everything okay?

03:51.281 --> 03:52.917
Cynthia left me.

03:52.950 --> 03:54.317
- No!
- Yeah.

03:54.351 --> 03:56.420
Umm... Troy?

03:56.454 --> 03:57.889
Mayfield,
Mayfield. Come on.

03:57.922 --> 03:58.890
I'll call you later.

03:58.923 --> 04:00.992
Please.

04:01.025 --> 04:03.461
Uh, Williams,
stop filming people.

04:03.494 --> 04:05.530
This isn't a reality show, okay?

04:05.563 --> 04:08.231
Troy... I have become aware
of a very serious matter

04:08.265 --> 04:10.568
and I want you to try
to explain it to me.

04:14.772 --> 04:19.409
<i>♪ She's got me wrapped
Around her finger ♪</i>

04:20.912 --> 04:23.481
<i>♪ Never seen it clearer ♪</i>

04:23.514 --> 04:24.749
Hey, Troy!

04:24.782 --> 04:26.249
I can honestly
smell the hormones

04:26.283 --> 04:29.020
pouring out of you,
and it's nauseating.

04:29.053 --> 04:30.588
And according to this report...

04:30.621 --> 04:31.823
all 80 of our students

04:31.856 --> 04:33.624
got a perfect score on a test

04:33.658 --> 04:36.494
that you helped tutor them for.

04:36.527 --> 04:38.896
Outstanding.

04:38.930 --> 04:43.333
And that's how we won
the nationwide first prize...

04:44.434 --> 04:46.604
New computers! Hahaha!

04:46.637 --> 04:47.472
Wow.

04:47.505 --> 04:48.405
I've been begging
the superintendent

04:48.438 --> 04:50.608
for air conditioning
for about six years,

04:50.641 --> 04:52.375
but new computers are good.

04:52.409 --> 04:53.745
Congratulations, Mr. Goodson.

04:53.778 --> 04:55.345
Eighty perfect scores.

04:55.378 --> 04:57.048
The school really
needed these computers.

04:57.081 --> 04:58.916
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- But the problem is

04:58.950 --> 05:03.454
is that only 15 of our students
entered the competition.

05:03.488 --> 05:06.958
That is odd...
that you would check that.

05:06.991 --> 05:08.893
Yeah! Oh my god,
I had a question for you

05:08.926 --> 05:10.427
and I had to write it down

05:10.461 --> 05:12.429
because I don't really
fully understand it.

05:12.463 --> 05:14.832
I'm old, you know?

05:14.866 --> 05:17.568
Did you illegally hack
into the NSF database

05:17.602 --> 05:22.339
and manipulate standardized
testing results?

05:22.372 --> 05:24.742
I was only trying
to help the school.

05:24.776 --> 05:29.346
And you have...
'cause this is...

05:29.379 --> 05:32.016
Mine! Hahahaha.

05:32.049 --> 05:33.918
I mean, if there ever was
a victimless crime.

05:33.951 --> 05:35.987
I do have to
suspend you though.

05:43.360 --> 05:45.797
I just did not
need this tonight, okay?

05:45.830 --> 05:49.332
You know how important
tonight is for Playfield Games.

05:49.366 --> 05:50.735
Actually, I don't.

05:50.768 --> 05:54.639
You never told me
what tonight's all about.

05:54.672 --> 05:56.707
You know, Mom, now
that I have some free time,

05:56.741 --> 05:57.608
I could come to work.

05:57.642 --> 06:00.645
I could come help out
at the company...

06:00.678 --> 06:01.979
No,
you're not gonna get rewarded

06:02.013 --> 06:05.415
for getting suspended,
all right?

06:05.448 --> 06:06.851
Oh! I've got the perfect way

06:06.884 --> 06:09.687
a suspended student
can help out tonight.

06:09.720 --> 06:11.055
<i>This is a fair punishment.</i>

06:11.088 --> 06:12.790
<i>I wonder if I could
turn this office party</i>

06:12.824 --> 06:15.026
<i>into some kind of video game?</i>

06:15.059 --> 06:17.028
<i>But which character
would I play as?</i>

06:17.061 --> 06:20.131
<i>Lyndon!
Something with money...</i>

06:20.164 --> 06:21.933
<i>Or I guess
I could play as...</i>

06:21.966 --> 06:24.769
<i>Laura!
Technical lead, I think...</i>

06:24.802 --> 06:27.905
<i>Or Marie! Uh...
always been nice.</i>

06:27.939 --> 06:29.574
<i>Playing as my mom
would be too weird...</i>

06:29.607 --> 06:31.809
<i>Kate! CEO.</i>

06:31.843 --> 06:34.579
But I would have
a pretty cool cane as a weapon.

06:34.612 --> 06:35.713
And then there's...

06:35.746 --> 06:37.982
Troy the boy, there he is.

06:38.015 --> 06:39.483
<i>Jimmy! Lead designer...</i>

06:39.517 --> 06:41.152
<i>no, no, no, not him!
Definitely not him!</i>

06:41.185 --> 06:42.920
<i>Go back, control Z, control Z!</i>

06:42.954 --> 06:45.089
<i>That doesn't work
in real life.</i>

06:45.122 --> 06:46.824
Go ahead and tell me
Troy Behar, what's going on?

06:46.858 --> 06:48.926
I heard you got kicked
out of school today.

06:48.960 --> 06:50.595
Well, if you're looking
for something to do,

06:50.628 --> 06:52.830
we could probably put you
to work over at Playfield.

06:52.864 --> 06:55.499
Wait, really?
That actually would be awesome.

06:55.533 --> 06:57.468
Yeah.
Do you know how to squeegee?

06:57.501 --> 06:59.737
Hehe. Just kiddin'.

06:59.770 --> 07:02.640
Jimmy!
Bruce is here. Come on.

07:02.673 --> 07:05.076
Yeah.

07:05.109 --> 07:06.477
Hey!

07:06.510 --> 07:08.045
Well, uh, hi.

07:08.079 --> 07:11.182
I know you.
I-I saw you.

07:11.215 --> 07:13.818
Yeah, at school.

07:13.851 --> 07:16.187
That was you, right?
Today... singing?

07:16.220 --> 07:18.856
Yeah, I just moved in
with my grandpa, Lyndon.

07:18.890 --> 07:20.825
He wanted me to get out
and socialize.

07:23.995 --> 07:25.630
You're actually like
the first person under 80

07:25.663 --> 07:26.964
I've met outside of school.

07:26.998 --> 07:29.901
Same.

07:29.934 --> 07:32.770
Uh... okay.

07:32.803 --> 07:34.672
- So is that deejay your friend?
- One, two, three, ah!

07:34.705 --> 07:38.142
One, two, three, ah!
One, two, three, ah!

07:38.175 --> 07:40.478
Yeah, Nick.

07:40.511 --> 07:41.979
Well, he's my best friend.

07:42.013 --> 07:43.915
My only friend, actually.

07:43.948 --> 07:45.917
Yeah... but he is a lot.

07:45.950 --> 07:48.986
So... Troy the boy, is it?

07:49.020 --> 07:51.088
Ah... just Troy.

07:51.122 --> 07:52.123
Just Paige.

07:58.629 --> 08:02.066
Sorry, um...

08:02.099 --> 08:05.836
So, you are the first angel
investor who really gets us.

08:05.870 --> 08:06.904
The truth of the matter is

08:06.938 --> 08:07.905
my grandkids
have been after me

08:07.939 --> 08:10.741
to invest into something
cool, you know, forever.

08:10.775 --> 08:14.679
And, well, I am
very deep into BitCoin.

08:14.712 --> 08:16.113
- Whoa.
- Yeah!

08:16.147 --> 08:18.649
But between us,
I don't really know what it is.

08:18.683 --> 08:19.617
No, no one does.

08:19.650 --> 08:22.019
And they are obsessed
with your old games.

08:22.053 --> 08:23.921
And so I just figured
this was a shoo-in.

08:23.955 --> 08:25.089
It is a shoo-in,

08:25.122 --> 08:27.158
and you're so smart
to invest in us.

08:27.191 --> 08:28.993
And we're really grateful
to have you onboard.

08:29.026 --> 08:30.661
This is very exciting for us.

08:30.695 --> 08:32.196
If you want something to do,

08:32.229 --> 08:34.565
there's, like,
a karaoke machine

08:34.598 --> 08:35.533
hooked up to the speakers...

08:35.566 --> 08:38.102
I'm really not looking
for the spotlight.

08:38.135 --> 08:40.905
Yeah. Yeah, totally.
That's cool.

08:40.938 --> 08:43.040
What's this
whole thing for, anyway?

08:43.074 --> 08:45.776
Uh... it's for my mom's
company.

08:45.810 --> 08:48.679
Yeah. I think there's a lot
riding on it.

08:48.713 --> 08:49.814
It's very cool.

08:49.847 --> 08:51.115
Very, very cool.

08:51.148 --> 08:52.583
Is that your dad?

08:52.616 --> 08:55.186
No, my dad died
when I was little.

08:55.219 --> 08:57.555
I'm... I'm really sorry.
I didn't know.

08:57.588 --> 09:00.257
No, it's totally fine.
It was a long time ago.

09:00.291 --> 09:01.158
It's been just me and my mom

09:01.192 --> 09:04.095
for like basically
my whole life, so...

09:04.128 --> 09:05.563
I can kinda relate to that.

09:05.596 --> 09:09.000
My dad's not really
in my life either.

09:09.033 --> 09:11.102
Bruce, here.
Now it's still in beta.

09:11.135 --> 09:12.737
Don't show it to anyone else,

09:12.770 --> 09:14.205
but put it under
your kids' pillows.

09:14.238 --> 09:15.306
They're gonna
love this game so much

09:15.339 --> 09:17.608
they're gonna be
wetting your bed!

09:17.641 --> 09:18.809
Uhhhh...

09:18.843 --> 09:20.845
Actually, my grandkids
do have a problem with wetting.

09:20.878 --> 09:21.912
- So...
- Ahhh...

09:21.946 --> 09:23.047
It's a bit of a problem.

09:23.080 --> 09:24.115
It's an expression. Heh-heh.

09:24.148 --> 09:25.683
It's a mess.

09:25.716 --> 09:27.184
But, no,
I like where your head is.

09:27.218 --> 09:30.921
Well, look, can I get you
a drink before we ink?

09:30.955 --> 09:32.323
Very very good,
I like that slogan.

09:32.356 --> 09:33.357
You know what,
I'm good, thank you.

09:33.391 --> 09:36.160
I'm gonna grab it myself,
which means I will...

09:36.193 --> 09:37.862
BRB.

09:37.895 --> 09:38.863
My grandkids taught me that.

09:38.896 --> 09:39.864
Oh yes, yes.

09:39.897 --> 09:40.898
God bless 'em.

09:40.931 --> 09:43.768
Well, LOL. Heh-heh.

09:43.801 --> 09:45.302
I think that's dirty.

09:45.336 --> 09:46.871
- No! No, no, no.
- No, no.

09:46.904 --> 09:48.773
Laugh out loud
or laugh online.

09:48.806 --> 09:49.974
Not everyone's laughing.

09:50.007 --> 09:53.177
We just like to have fun.
Heh heh. We have a good time.

09:53.210 --> 09:55.046
Oh my god, what did you do?

09:55.079 --> 09:57.114
- I don't know why I said...
- Why did you give him that?

09:57.148 --> 09:57.948
- He's gonna love it.
- No, no. It's not ready!

09:57.982 --> 09:59.116
He won't know
what to do with it.

09:59.150 --> 10:00.084
- It's really not ready.
- Are you kidding? It's ready.

10:00.117 --> 10:01.752
He'll be able to see
little bits and bots.

10:01.786 --> 10:02.820
It'll be fine.

10:02.853 --> 10:04.088
Hey, can I ask you something?

10:04.121 --> 10:05.222
Yes.

10:05.256 --> 10:08.659
Why does she need that cane?

10:08.692 --> 10:10.628
She's a wizard.

10:10.661 --> 10:11.829
A wizard?

10:11.862 --> 10:14.231
She has like a...
a wizard castle.

10:14.265 --> 10:15.733
Come on,
what's the cane for?

10:15.766 --> 10:20.638
Uh... well, she has MS.

10:20.671 --> 10:21.939
I'm two for two.

10:21.972 --> 10:23.174
No, you're fine.

10:23.207 --> 10:24.942
It doesn't slow her down much.

10:24.975 --> 10:26.877
It doesn't seem to.

10:26.911 --> 10:29.246
At least not tonight.

10:29.280 --> 10:31.882
Ho-ho, Helen of Troy!

10:31.916 --> 10:32.716
Ah!

10:32.750 --> 10:34.718
Looks like
you don't need any help

10:34.752 --> 10:35.986
picking up one of the ladies.

10:36.020 --> 10:37.755
Just kidding.

10:37.788 --> 10:39.824
Troy Story, your mom
is about to start talking

10:39.857 --> 10:40.891
so if you can take care
of the music

10:40.925 --> 10:43.294
and wrap up whatever this...
isn't.

10:46.697 --> 10:48.766
Jimmy...

10:48.799 --> 10:51.102
That guy is awesome.

10:51.135 --> 10:53.637
Yeah, he thinks so.

10:53.671 --> 10:54.905
- Ummm.
- Ummmm...

10:54.939 --> 10:56.874
Yeah, so that...
well, I do have to...

10:56.907 --> 10:57.942
I have to go.

10:57.975 --> 10:59.143
Oh, yeah, uh...

10:59.176 --> 11:01.812
Uh... see ya...

11:01.846 --> 11:04.682
- Bye.
- Bye.

11:04.715 --> 11:07.084
This thing is heavy.

11:07.118 --> 11:11.956
Your mind is strong,
but your arms are weak.

11:11.989 --> 11:12.990
Hey, guys!

11:13.023 --> 11:14.091
Oh, god, uh, sorry.

11:14.125 --> 11:15.426
Great deejaying.

11:15.460 --> 11:17.261
Thank you.

11:17.294 --> 11:18.762
It's just my side gig.

11:18.796 --> 11:20.664
I'm more of an influencer.

11:20.698 --> 11:22.867
I just crossed
a thousand subs on YouTube.

11:22.900 --> 11:23.801
You gotta check it out.

11:23.834 --> 11:27.171
It's YouTube dot com
slash Nickalicious.

11:27.204 --> 11:28.772
Oh, excuse me.
I'm sorry.

11:28.806 --> 11:31.342
Are you millennials,
by any chance?

11:31.375 --> 11:34.912
I have this new game
on this thing here.

11:34.945 --> 11:36.347
Anyway, it's not even
available to the public yet,

11:36.380 --> 11:39.016
but I'm just not sure
how to download it.

11:39.049 --> 11:41.785
Could you help me?

11:41.819 --> 11:43.187
Let's step into his office.

11:47.024 --> 11:48.792
<i>Smashing, smashing, smashing.</i>

11:48.826 --> 11:50.694
Look at all this clipping.

11:50.728 --> 11:51.762
The guy's head
pokes out of the building

11:51.795 --> 11:53.697
every time he jumps.

11:53.731 --> 11:54.765
I bet the bug report
for this thing

11:54.798 --> 11:56.200
is like a mile long.

11:56.233 --> 11:57.835
This soundtrack makes me sad.

11:57.868 --> 12:00.304
It just feels retro
for retro's sake.

12:00.337 --> 12:02.173
Sir, where'd you find this?

12:02.206 --> 12:05.342
Dude, I can make the game
glitch anytime I want, watch.

12:08.412 --> 12:09.481
Told ya.

12:09.514 --> 12:12.416
Sir, it's just my opinion,
but throw this game out

12:12.449 --> 12:15.487
and get yourself
a game from Playfield.

12:15.520 --> 12:19.457
I almost did.
You can keep that.

12:25.530 --> 12:28.866
Oh, shhhh...

12:28.899 --> 12:32.169
This is kind of
a historic moment for all of us.

12:32.203 --> 12:36.006
Because we have finally
found our angel investor.

12:36.040 --> 12:38.042
And not a moment
too soon, right, Lyndon?

12:38.075 --> 12:41.078
Whoa... Whew!

12:41.111 --> 12:44.148
Alright, I'd like everyone
to raise your glasses.

12:44.181 --> 12:48.886
Without any further ado,
I give you Bruce!

12:48.919 --> 12:51.489
Bruce, are you here?
Come join us!

12:51.523 --> 12:52.790
He's gone.

12:52.823 --> 12:53.658
What?

12:53.692 --> 12:55.392
Slipped out the back,
I don't know.

12:55.426 --> 12:57.828
Mom...

12:57.861 --> 12:59.296
Troy?

13:05.336 --> 13:08.973
Oh...

13:09.006 --> 13:12.109
I'm sorry, everybody,
I think I spoke too soon, but...

13:14.178 --> 13:15.179
I'm sorry.

14:11.201 --> 14:13.971
Hey, Mom.

14:14.004 --> 14:16.206
Umm... Mom, I'm so sorry.

14:16.240 --> 14:17.509
I'm sure it must have been
very difficult for you

14:17.542 --> 14:19.910
to not rip apart our game

14:19.943 --> 14:23.213
in front of the only person
you didn't know at the party.

14:23.247 --> 14:26.183
I'm going to have to figure
something else out.

14:29.521 --> 14:32.590
Kate, this is awkward, but...

14:32.624 --> 14:34.992
we don't have
any more money.

14:35.025 --> 14:36.494
What?

14:36.528 --> 14:38.395
I said we have no more money.

14:38.429 --> 14:41.098
But this is...
this is a bank, Larry.

14:41.131 --> 14:44.101
We ran out.
Let me call somebody.

14:44.134 --> 14:45.269
Because we're friends.

14:45.302 --> 14:46.370
Okay.

14:48.906 --> 14:51.375
Hey, Jeff. Hi.

14:51.408 --> 14:53.545
Yeah, Kate's here. Okay.

14:53.578 --> 14:55.145
She can't have the money?

14:55.179 --> 14:57.014
Because we don't have any more?

14:57.047 --> 15:00.317
Alright, that's what I thought.
Thank you.

15:00.351 --> 15:01.653
See?

15:01.686 --> 15:03.220
You know, if you don't
want to give me the money,

15:03.253 --> 15:04.154
you could just say no.

15:04.188 --> 15:05.557
No.

15:05.590 --> 15:08.892
With your payroll
where it's at, we can't.

15:08.926 --> 15:10.227
I mean, even if we could,
we can't.

15:24.676 --> 15:26.310
You know what,
I gotta go...

15:32.383 --> 15:34.151
Kate, tell me,

15:34.184 --> 15:35.953
to what do I owe this pleasure?

15:35.986 --> 15:38.989
I'll cut straight to the chase.

15:39.022 --> 15:43.461
We've run into a bit of a snag
and if our game isn't a big hit,

15:43.495 --> 15:45.996
we're gonna be
in a lot of trouble.

15:46.029 --> 15:50.635
So, I was wondering if you might
possibly be interested in...

15:50.668 --> 15:53.571
Buying out your games.
Yeah, I would do that for you.

15:53.605 --> 15:56.974
Look, Kate, playing
your early games in college

15:57.007 --> 15:58.942
is what got me into
this business to begin with.

15:58.976 --> 16:00.077
You know, I don't know
if "ol' Rickers"

16:00.110 --> 16:01.646
would made it through
five and a half years at Brown

16:01.679 --> 16:03.981
if it wasn't for
Playfield Games.

16:04.014 --> 16:06.216
I probably would have just
resorted to girls and drugs,

16:06.250 --> 16:08.218
so, thank God,
you saved me from that.

16:08.252 --> 16:09.420
Wow.

16:09.454 --> 16:13.257
So, here's the paperwork.
We are gonna make this happen.

16:13.290 --> 16:14.291
Thank you.

16:14.324 --> 16:16.126
Uh, I'm a little weirded out

16:16.160 --> 16:18.295
that you had this
all prepared already.

16:18.328 --> 16:21.533
Well, I'm a Boy Scout, Kate.
I'm always prepared.

16:21.566 --> 16:23.400
Okay. Great.

16:23.434 --> 16:25.737
You know what, um...
speaking of boys...

16:25.770 --> 16:26.671
What?

16:26.704 --> 16:29.574
Hey. Why don't you take
our latest game?

16:29.607 --> 16:31.208
I'm sure that
Templeton's gonna love it.

16:31.241 --> 16:33.745
Temp... Troy?

16:33.778 --> 16:36.246
Dang it, I knew
it started with a T.

16:36.280 --> 16:38.182
You know what, I'm gonna
give myself a high five anyway

16:38.215 --> 16:39.183
because I got
pretty close on that one.

16:39.216 --> 16:40.518
Alright, up high, baby!

16:40.552 --> 16:42.085
Boom.

16:42.119 --> 16:43.655
P.S.
There would not be jobs here

16:43.688 --> 16:45.723
for any of your employees,
of course.

16:45.757 --> 16:46.691
It's great to see you.

16:58.302 --> 16:59.737
Mom, you left
before I could tell you

16:59.771 --> 17:01.673
but look what I did
on Jackhouse.

17:01.706 --> 17:05.108
Wow, you really did make
a lot of progress.

17:06.744 --> 17:09.446
Check this out.

17:09.481 --> 17:10.748
Xodus?

17:10.782 --> 17:12.349
I have to consider
selling the company to them.

17:12.382 --> 17:13.317
What? Why?

17:13.350 --> 17:16.688
That's what they're releasing
at Pixelcon.

17:16.721 --> 17:21.124
<i>Welcome to Planet Hell.</i>

17:21.158 --> 17:25.128
<i>Prepare to enter your
credit card information.</i>

17:25.162 --> 17:27.465
Microtransactions?
That's terrible.

17:27.499 --> 17:30.167
What the... Mom, this is
like a high end rip-off of...

17:30.200 --> 17:32.402
Yeah, that's...
that's what they do.

17:32.436 --> 17:34.672
Mom, I didn't know
it was that bad at Playfield.

17:34.706 --> 17:35.473
Let me come and help.

17:35.507 --> 17:37.441
I'm actually
really good at this.

17:37.475 --> 17:40.310
You and your dad
share the same gift.

17:40.344 --> 17:42.780
But he did not have
a normal childhood

17:42.814 --> 17:45.282
and we both swore to each other
that you would.

17:45.315 --> 17:48.486
I know, Mom...
but Dad is gone.

17:48.520 --> 17:50.287
And he has been
for a long time.

17:50.320 --> 17:55.125
And... things aren't normal now.

17:55.158 --> 17:57.361
I don't know how you added
all this to the game.

17:57.394 --> 17:59.263
Please... Mom.

17:59.296 --> 18:00.565
Please, I feel like
this is the only way

18:00.598 --> 18:03.801
I can make up for what I did.

18:03.835 --> 18:07.304
<i>Smashing, smashing, smashing.</i>

18:09.239 --> 18:10.440
Come on, get dressed.
We're going to work.

18:32.530 --> 18:34.331
Hi, Laura, Marie.

18:34.364 --> 18:35.767
I just want to say I'm sorry

18:35.800 --> 18:38.703
about the investor thing
last night.

18:38.736 --> 18:42.372
You're sorry
about the investor thing?

18:42.406 --> 18:44.408
Do you even understand
what you did?

18:44.441 --> 18:47.110
Let me explain it in words
that you'll understand.

18:47.144 --> 18:51.248
What you did was
very, very not lit, fam.

18:52.382 --> 18:54.217
Don't mind her,
she's just salty

18:54.251 --> 18:56.854
because you might've
cost us all of our jobs.

18:59.356 --> 19:01.559
Zack and Cody!

19:01.593 --> 19:02.760
Hey, Jimmy.

19:02.794 --> 19:04.462
Hey, slugger.

19:04.495 --> 19:06.464
Pretty girl last night.
Did you get in the game?

19:06.497 --> 19:07.364
Get in the batter's box?

19:07.397 --> 19:11.569
Coach give you the signals?

19:11.603 --> 19:14.739
No. I-I did play around
with Jackhouse, though.

19:14.772 --> 19:15.807
What'd you think?

19:15.840 --> 19:17.775
Uh, you really want to know?

19:17.809 --> 19:19.109
Yeah!

19:23.848 --> 19:25.349
Uh, it's good.

19:25.382 --> 19:27.217
It was good?
That's it?

19:27.250 --> 19:29.386
Uh, really good?

19:29.419 --> 19:31.589
Really good?
It is great!

19:31.623 --> 19:34.257
This is my Mario 3.
This is a perfect game.

19:34.291 --> 19:36.728
You know what, that old man,
he just didn't get it.

19:36.761 --> 19:39.229
And it's Jackhouse because
they jackhammer houses?

19:39.262 --> 19:41.699
Yeah! See, you get it.

19:41.733 --> 19:43.501
Jackhouse because
of the jackhammer, right?

19:43.534 --> 19:45.202
She gets it.
Everyone here gets it.

19:45.235 --> 19:46.370
It is gettable.

19:46.403 --> 19:49.439
We're gonna build this thing
and it's going to rock.

19:49.474 --> 19:50.842
All right?
Your mom is gonna find cash

19:50.875 --> 19:51.843
somewhere else for it.

19:51.876 --> 19:53.478
But, we're gonna be okay.

19:58.415 --> 20:01.318
Kate, I-I hate
to be such a regular

20:01.351 --> 20:02.754
Debbie Down in the Dumps,

20:02.787 --> 20:07.558
but we-we do need to manage
our cash flow situation.

20:07.592 --> 20:09.527
I know, I know.
And I have a plan.

20:09.560 --> 20:11.462
I mean, if we don't
knock their socks

20:11.496 --> 20:13.230
right out of the water
at that show,

20:13.263 --> 20:16.968
we... we won't make payroll
next month.

20:17.001 --> 20:20.872
There is another solution.
The uh...

20:20.905 --> 20:22.406
No.

20:22.439 --> 20:26.644
Kate, Kate, look, uh,
layoffs are a fact of life.

20:26.678 --> 20:28.546
I can't break the promise
that George and I made

20:28.579 --> 20:30.915
12 years ago to all of you.

20:30.948 --> 20:33.283
We'll just have to find
a better way.

20:33.316 --> 20:35.252
Oh, I know we will, Kate.

20:35.285 --> 20:36.854
I know we will.

20:36.888 --> 20:38.523
We always do.

20:42.026 --> 20:43.594
People will get it.
They understand.

20:43.628 --> 20:45.328
All right?
It's fun. It's playable.

20:45.362 --> 20:46.329
I need you...
I want you to see it.

20:46.363 --> 20:47.098
Do you see it?
Do you see me?

20:47.131 --> 20:48.533
Do you see it?
You don't see it?

20:48.566 --> 20:49.701
It's a winner.

20:49.734 --> 20:53.270
That's all I'm saying.

20:53.303 --> 20:56.974
Winner!

20:57.008 --> 21:00.011
So... Jimmy, Laura,
everyone out there

21:00.044 --> 21:02.947
has been working weeks
to try and fix those glitches

21:02.980 --> 21:04.982
that you managed to fix
in one night.

21:05.016 --> 21:06.283
And all those new features
you added...

21:06.316 --> 21:07.317
Are legit.

21:07.350 --> 21:08.820
They are too legit.

21:08.853 --> 21:10.688
Yeah. Oh! Wait!

21:10.722 --> 21:11.689
No, Mom, don't...

21:11.723 --> 21:15.258
♪ Too legit to quitttttt ♪

21:15.292 --> 21:16.894
Yeah. Still got it.

21:16.928 --> 21:20.263
Look, all joking aside,
we need a fresh look at things.

21:20.297 --> 21:23.534
And it just so happens
that our team is...

21:23.568 --> 21:24.802
<i>Smashing.</i>

21:24.836 --> 21:29.306
...fresh out of ideas.

21:29.339 --> 21:32.009
That's why I am putting you
in charge of Jackhouse.

21:34.078 --> 21:35.046
Are you messing with me or...?

21:35.079 --> 21:37.582
No, and you better not
make me regret this.

21:37.615 --> 21:39.416
You're just going to help us
with this one game

21:39.449 --> 21:41.351
and then it's
back to school with you.

21:41.384 --> 21:42.220
Wow, wait, holy crap.

21:42.252 --> 21:46.023
So, I get to be in charge
of the game.

21:46.057 --> 21:47.725
Wait, am I in charge
of Jimmy too?

21:47.759 --> 21:49.694
Are you out of your mind?

21:49.727 --> 21:52.063
You just have to see
what he did last night, okay?

21:52.096 --> 21:53.698
He fixed all of the bugs

21:53.731 --> 21:56.067
and he created all these
customizable skins.

21:56.100 --> 21:58.301
There's a rainbow that talks,

21:58.335 --> 22:00.872
there's Barack Obama,
there's, there's a jellyfish.

22:00.905 --> 22:03.875
This is insane!
I'm going insane.

22:03.908 --> 22:05.375
Look, I know
how hard you've worked,

22:05.408 --> 22:06.244
but we are out of time.

22:06.276 --> 22:07.912
So, you're gonna
put this thumbsucker

22:07.945 --> 22:09.013
in charge of my game?

22:09.046 --> 22:10.148
- Hey!
- Jimmy!

22:10.181 --> 22:13.751
Troy is in charge of all
game decisions until Pixelcon.

22:13.785 --> 22:15.820
End of discussion.

22:15.853 --> 22:17.555
Now let's get to work.

22:17.588 --> 22:21.324
Troy, I'd like you to set up
in your dad's old office.

22:21.358 --> 22:23.461
Okay.

22:23.494 --> 22:26.764
Come on.

22:27.865 --> 22:30.701
I'm sorry, Jimmy.
This is the way it has to be.

23:09.040 --> 23:10.508
Your mom let you
keep your phone?

23:10.541 --> 23:11.709
Dude, even better.

23:11.742 --> 23:12.877
I will tell you all about it

23:12.910 --> 23:15.412
if you bring a few Red Bulls
to Playfield after school.

23:15.445 --> 23:16.747
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Did you say Playfield?</i>

23:16.781 --> 23:19.083
- <i>Whoa, whoa, whoa...</i>
- Red Bulls. Okay, bye!

23:23.955 --> 23:26.090
<i>♪ What do you say? ♪</i>

Wow.

23:47.111 --> 23:48.679
Paige, what are you doing here?

23:48.713 --> 23:50.648
I'm staying with my grandpa
right now

23:50.681 --> 23:54.585
while my parents
"work things out."

23:54.619 --> 23:57.188
So, I have to come here
every day after school.

23:57.221 --> 23:59.724
Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.

23:59.757 --> 24:00.992
I mean... about your parents.

24:01.025 --> 24:02.159
It's great
that you get to be here.

24:02.193 --> 24:04.061
I have to be here too.

24:04.095 --> 24:05.963
Whose office is this?

24:05.997 --> 24:09.500
It's my dad's old office,
or it used to be,

24:09.533 --> 24:10.968
but it's actually mine now.

24:11.002 --> 24:13.604
Yeah, my mom put me
in charge of the game.

24:13.638 --> 24:14.639
She what?

24:14.672 --> 24:16.774
Holy crap and a half!

24:16.807 --> 24:17.942
This is really happening.

24:19.076 --> 24:20.711
- Yes, oh, yes.
- This is really happening!

24:20.745 --> 24:24.782
Ohh! Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!
Ohh! Ohh! Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!

24:24.815 --> 24:27.952
Yeah, whoo! Yes, yes!

24:27.985 --> 24:30.621
Psych! Ohhhh!

24:30.655 --> 24:32.156
Hey, have you guys
ever thought of

24:32.189 --> 24:35.226
maybe dancing like
somebody <i>is</i> watching?

24:35.259 --> 24:36.761
This is your destiny.

24:36.794 --> 24:38.863
- Easy, bro.
- I've got homework to do.

24:38.896 --> 24:40.965
You two can discuss
your destiny, but, um,

24:40.998 --> 24:43.768
I want to hear about this later.

24:43.801 --> 24:47.138
For sure.

24:47.171 --> 24:50.541
This is getting
better and better.

24:50.574 --> 24:51.809
- It's the best.
- <i>Team...</i>

24:51.842 --> 24:52.910
<i>Troy, conference room!</i>

24:52.944 --> 24:53.878
- Yes!
- Dude...

24:53.911 --> 24:55.780
It's time for my
first meeting with the team.

24:55.813 --> 24:57.815
What do I do?

24:57.848 --> 25:00.251
I don't know. Just tell them
what they want to hear.

25:00.284 --> 25:01.619
Good advice.

25:01.652 --> 25:02.687
It is good advice.

25:02.720 --> 25:04.889
Give 'em hell.

25:04.922 --> 25:07.224
Hey, can I be an intern?

25:07.258 --> 25:08.893
What's the pay like?

25:08.926 --> 25:10.027
Well, I don't care.

25:10.061 --> 25:12.997
Unpaid intern it is!

25:13.030 --> 25:14.966
Let me clean this up.

25:22.173 --> 25:26.844
I called you all here
to let you know that...

25:26.877 --> 25:30.781
that you have
the rest of the day off.

25:30.815 --> 25:32.249
Are you out of your mind?

25:32.283 --> 25:34.752
We will never get the demo ready
by taking days off.

25:34.785 --> 25:36.821
We haven't even worked
on our Pixelcon booth yet.

25:36.854 --> 25:38.923
I heard Xodus is dropping
seven figures on theirs.

25:38.956 --> 25:39.890
- Seven?
- Yeah.

25:39.924 --> 25:40.958
Kate?

25:45.730 --> 25:48.532
Maybe it couldn't hurt
to take the afternoon off.

25:48.566 --> 25:49.834
You know, enjoy yourselves
a little bit.

25:49.867 --> 25:51.135
You've been working so hard.

25:51.168 --> 25:53.004
Go have some fun.

25:53.037 --> 25:55.706
- You deserve it.
- Are you serious?

25:55.740 --> 25:57.174
- What am I...
- Sounds terrible.

25:57.208 --> 25:59.744
I have two teenagers at home.

25:59.777 --> 26:00.745
I've never had a day off.

26:00.778 --> 26:02.013
What are we doing?

26:02.046 --> 26:05.750
This is bad.

26:05.783 --> 26:07.184
Have you lost your mind?

26:07.218 --> 26:09.887
I need some time to
think and work on my own

26:09.920 --> 26:11.589
to figure this out.

26:13.657 --> 26:16.293
I love you.
Get to work.

26:29.774 --> 26:31.042
Hey, where are
your employees going?

26:31.075 --> 26:32.643
I told them
what they wanted to hear.

26:32.676 --> 26:34.678
That they have
the rest of the day off.

26:34.712 --> 26:37.081
Huh! Best boss ever!

26:37.114 --> 26:39.083
Dude, guess what?

26:39.116 --> 26:41.786
I got myself
an independent study

26:41.819 --> 26:43.287
so now I can be here
all the time too.

26:43.320 --> 26:45.022
For credit.

26:45.056 --> 26:47.224
You know, Mr. Diehl
might be helpful too.

26:47.258 --> 26:48.859
He designed
that first-person game

26:48.893 --> 26:50.895
we used to play when
we were kids, Athena 9.

26:50.928 --> 26:51.929
No. That's cool,

26:51.962 --> 26:55.599
but I think coding's
changed a bit since COBOL.

26:55.633 --> 26:59.203
Okay. Uh, then this is
your unpaid intern

26:59.236 --> 27:01.272
reporting for duty.

27:01.305 --> 27:02.306
Where should I start?

27:02.339 --> 27:04.642
I can interview you
and start cutting together

27:04.675 --> 27:07.611
a behind-the-scenes look
at your meteoric rise...

27:07.645 --> 27:09.914
Good idea.
Just really don't do that.

27:09.947 --> 27:11.849
Okay.

27:11.882 --> 27:13.818
Can you just give me
a little alone time?

27:13.851 --> 27:15.386
I really need to
get started on this.

27:15.419 --> 27:20.024
Okay.
Right, gotcha.

27:20.057 --> 27:21.192
Cool.

27:21.225 --> 27:23.828
Solitude.

27:23.861 --> 27:28.199
Totally get it.

27:29.300 --> 27:31.102
I'll be in the intern
department if you need me.

27:31.135 --> 27:35.139
All right?

27:52.890 --> 27:55.292
Couldn't send an email?

Hey, what's going on?

28:44.008 --> 28:45.910
I... I gave the staff
a few days off

28:45.943 --> 28:47.311
so I could work on my own.

28:47.344 --> 28:49.780
You don't need their help?

28:49.813 --> 28:52.484
Sounds weird and lonely.

28:52.517 --> 28:53.817
Mind if I join?

28:53.851 --> 28:54.919
- Uh... I'm not quite...
- Thanks!

29:01.792 --> 29:04.728
Man!

29:04.762 --> 29:06.297
I've taken a couple of
coding classes at school

29:06.330 --> 29:11.802
but... this is crazy town.

29:11.835 --> 29:14.071
You did all this yourself?

29:14.104 --> 29:16.073
How?

29:16.106 --> 29:18.442
I can't really explain it.

29:18.476 --> 29:21.045
I heard my dad was the same way.

29:23.847 --> 29:26.417
I don't know
about your dad, but...

29:26.450 --> 29:29.820
your mom is awesome
for giving you this shot.

29:29.853 --> 29:32.056
It's amazing
how much she trusts you.

29:32.089 --> 29:34.992
I kind of wish I could be
like your mom, you know.

29:35.025 --> 29:37.127
Just being able to get up
in front of a group of people

29:37.161 --> 29:39.063
and command
everyone's attention.

29:39.096 --> 29:41.198
Why can't you?

29:41.232 --> 29:42.534
I don't know.

29:42.567 --> 29:44.235
I think I rock it in a choir,

29:44.268 --> 29:45.436
but when they ask me
to sing solo though,

29:45.470 --> 29:50.407
I kinda just... freeze up.

29:50.441 --> 29:52.309
That's like
the opposite of me.

29:52.343 --> 29:54.945
I can only code
when I'm on my own.

29:54.979 --> 29:57.014
Okay, you gotta tell me
how you did this.

29:57.047 --> 29:59.016
Like how the hell
your mind works.

29:59.049 --> 30:01.018
Is it all just zeros and ones?

30:01.051 --> 30:02.286
Kinda.

30:02.319 --> 30:04.154
The trick to coding
is understanding

30:04.188 --> 30:05.823
that everything has to be
in the right order

30:05.856 --> 30:07.459
or it's not going to work.

30:07.492 --> 30:10.528
But I don't just see
zeros and ones.

30:10.562 --> 30:13.230
Here, let me show you.

30:13.264 --> 30:16.867
When I'm coding,
I see a whole other world.

30:16.900 --> 30:19.504
A world where
anything is possible.

dot com just came.

31:27.404 --> 31:28.305
You know what this is, right?

31:28.339 --> 31:30.575
Oh, yes I do.

31:30.608 --> 31:32.443
Dudes who magic?

31:32.477 --> 31:34.311
We're ready.

31:39.383 --> 31:41.051
Alright, everybody,
gather around.

31:41.085 --> 31:42.554
The man is ready.

31:42.587 --> 31:45.155
What? What's going on?
What's happening?

31:45.189 --> 31:47.991
Three, two, and one.

31:48.025 --> 31:51.095
The air is charged
with electricity.

31:51.128 --> 31:53.163
Everyone anxiously awaiting

31:53.197 --> 31:57.201
the unveiling
of Troy's presentation.

31:57.234 --> 32:02.005
You can cut the tension
with a chainsaw.

32:14.619 --> 32:18.055
Playfield gamers,
I bid you welcome.

32:18.088 --> 32:20.157
The boy knows
how to make an entrance.

32:20.190 --> 32:22.960
Prepare to journey
into a fantasy realm,

32:22.993 --> 32:26.196
the likes of which your
mortal eyes have never seen.

32:26.230 --> 32:28.600
I will be your guide

32:28.633 --> 32:32.069
as we journey
to the World of Yort!

32:32.102 --> 32:33.170
Yort?

32:33.203 --> 32:35.372
A yurt,
like a circular tent.

32:35.406 --> 32:36.541
No, Yort.

32:36.574 --> 32:37.609
Oh, okay. Sorry.

32:37.642 --> 32:39.443
Yort!

32:39.477 --> 32:43.380
A magical beast
that bestows upon its captor

32:43.414 --> 32:47.552
the ability to return
to their own dimension.

32:47.585 --> 32:50.053
Enter... if you dare.

32:52.724 --> 32:55.727
Well, I dare.

32:55.760 --> 32:58.195
Our game begins here,

32:58.228 --> 33:00.665
in the Tavern
of the Three Toads.

33:04.268 --> 33:08.071
<i>Each of you will
choose your character</i>

33:08.105 --> 33:12.477
<i>from one of five different
archetypes, yes.</i>

33:12.510 --> 33:16.046
<i>The knight... the thief...</i>

33:16.079 --> 33:18.081
<i>barbarian...</i>

33:18.115 --> 33:22.019
<i>monk... or the wizard.</i>

33:22.052 --> 33:23.621
So, it's like a standard RPG.

33:23.655 --> 33:26.056
Shhh, let him
do the voices.

33:28.392 --> 33:32.630
From there, you will journey
alone to an alternate past

33:32.664 --> 33:36.333
where your adventure will begin.

33:36.366 --> 33:39.571
Danger lurks at every turn,
however.

33:39.604 --> 33:43.207
Beware the
Shadow People!

33:50.380 --> 33:53.417
Survive the wasteland...

33:55.052 --> 33:58.690
and venture to the keep
of the Lava King!

33:58.723 --> 34:02.694
Rooooar!

34:02.727 --> 34:04.428
Sorry, I'm sorry.

34:04.462 --> 34:06.129
I... I need to sit down.

34:06.163 --> 34:07.030
It's alright, Lyndon,

34:07.064 --> 34:08.265
I think we've heard
just about enough.

34:08.298 --> 34:10.668
So, is this all you've been
working on the last two days?

34:10.702 --> 34:12.604
It is, my lord.

34:12.637 --> 34:13.571
That's it?

34:13.605 --> 34:15.205
You haven't been working
on Jackhouse at all?

34:15.239 --> 34:18.810
Um... no.

34:18.843 --> 34:21.813
Okay, well,
cute little play.

34:21.846 --> 34:23.715
Kate, I mean, I'm not sure
what you expect us to do.

34:23.748 --> 34:25.048
He just cost us two days.

34:25.082 --> 34:26.518
There's nothing to show for it.

34:26.551 --> 34:29.386
Look, the longer
we let Gandalf lead us,

34:29.419 --> 34:31.456
the greater our chance is
we're gonna lose everything.

34:31.489 --> 34:33.658
We need to start focusing
on Jackhouse now!

34:33.691 --> 34:36.293
Jimmy, Jackhouse sucks.

34:36.326 --> 34:37.795
- Oh no, he didn't!
- Okay, okay.

34:37.829 --> 34:40.732
That's enough. Both of you.
All right?

34:40.765 --> 34:44.234
Let me show you
what we're up against.

34:47.137 --> 34:49.541
<i>Welcome to Planet Hell.</i>

34:54.344 --> 34:57.281
<i>You will never be prepared.</i>

34:57.314 --> 34:59.717
Whoa, that's a lot.

34:59.751 --> 35:03.153
<i>One hundred million aliens.</i>

35:03.186 --> 35:05.557
There's too many aliens!

35:05.590 --> 35:09.259
Okay, now to
make it painfully clear.

35:10.562 --> 35:13.765
<i>Smashing, smashing, smashing.</i>

35:16.266 --> 35:19.704
<i>Smashing, smashing, smashing.</i>

35:19.737 --> 35:21.573
<i>Smash, smash, smash.</i>

35:21.606 --> 35:24.341
Troy, can you honestly,
with their help,

35:24.374 --> 35:26.811
get all of this ready in time?

35:26.844 --> 35:28.445
Absolutely.

35:28.479 --> 35:30.648
Everything we need
is up on these walls.

35:30.682 --> 35:33.417
Everyone's instructions
are labeled with their name.

35:33.450 --> 35:38.155
All right then,
full speed 'til Pixelcon, okay?

35:38.188 --> 35:39.323
Nothing else.

35:44.328 --> 35:48.566
Sorry, Jimmy.

35:52.202 --> 35:53.905
Chay-roof?

35:53.938 --> 35:57.374
Well, I'm sure
that there's a game somewhere

35:57.407 --> 35:58.710
in this arts and crafts project,

35:58.743 --> 36:00.812
but it's at least
six months away.

36:00.845 --> 36:03.413
Okay. What choice
do we have, Jimmy?

36:03.447 --> 36:06.450
Work on Jackhouse.

36:06.484 --> 36:07.919
You saw what we were up
against.

36:13.558 --> 36:16.928
It's like
I'm talking to a wall.

36:16.961 --> 36:19.229
Troy, it's not working.
None of this is working.

36:19.262 --> 36:21.231
Guys, the drawings
are crystal clear.

36:21.264 --> 36:22.366
What's the problem?

36:22.399 --> 36:24.234
There's not enough memory
to cache all these assets.

36:24.267 --> 36:26.638
Also, we need to fix
the API call to the library.

36:26.671 --> 36:27.705
How does the space wizard
narrative

36:27.739 --> 36:28.873
dovetail into the castle story?

36:28.906 --> 36:31.241
Guys, guys!

36:31.274 --> 36:32.209
Can I have a minute?

36:32.242 --> 36:34.712
Alone, please?

36:34.746 --> 36:35.913
Okay, but there's
a lot of stuff

36:35.947 --> 36:37.515
- that doesn't make any sense.
- Please.

36:37.548 --> 36:39.684
There's two options
of the shape of it.

36:39.717 --> 36:41.284
I haven't seen that axe.
I'm glad it's not mine.

36:41.318 --> 36:43.220
I've been looking
at this all day,

36:43.253 --> 36:45.590
and it doesn't make any sense.

36:48.726 --> 36:50.795
Mom...

36:50.828 --> 36:53.831
these people, they don't...
they they're already just...

36:53.865 --> 36:55.198
can't I just do this on my own?

36:55.232 --> 36:57.367
They're just going to
slow me down.

36:57.401 --> 36:59.671
Honey, I had this
exact same conversation

36:59.704 --> 37:01.371
with your father
right in this very room

37:01.405 --> 37:02.774
12 years ago,

37:02.807 --> 37:04.509
and he eventually realized that

37:04.542 --> 37:06.978
they all have something
to contribute.

37:07.011 --> 37:08.980
Could you please figure out
a way to work with them?

37:09.013 --> 37:10.581
I can try.

37:10.615 --> 37:12.684
You gotta do better than try.

37:12.717 --> 37:15.419
These people
are also family to me.

37:15.453 --> 37:17.922
I know, Mom.

37:17.955 --> 37:19.490
I know.

37:19.524 --> 37:21.559
And Jimmy too.

37:21.592 --> 37:24.294
You kinda took a crap
all over his work.

37:24.327 --> 37:25.129
He's upset.

37:25.163 --> 37:27.264
I thought that guy
was bulletproof.

37:27.297 --> 37:29.000
How would you feel
if you worked on something

37:29.033 --> 37:30.535
for over a year,

37:30.568 --> 37:33.538
and some young hotshot
came in, half your age,

37:33.571 --> 37:35.606
and completely shredded it?

37:35.640 --> 37:37.407
Well, that kid would be eight,

37:37.441 --> 37:38.509
and that would be incredible.

37:38.543 --> 37:42.647
Okay, but Jimmy is
a really talented game designer.

37:42.680 --> 37:44.782
He is. It's just
we went down the wrong path

37:44.816 --> 37:46.751
with him for too long.

37:46.784 --> 37:50.722
Anyway, at some point,
you are gonna need Jimmy's help.

37:50.755 --> 37:53.290
Okay, I'll try.

37:53.323 --> 37:55.425
I mean, I will.

37:55.460 --> 37:58.930
Okay.

37:58.963 --> 38:00.531
Ah, Mom?

38:00.565 --> 38:02.967
Yeah.

38:03.000 --> 38:03.968
Thanks again.

38:04.001 --> 38:05.470
It's nothing.

38:10.675 --> 38:12.577
Troy, get over here.

38:25.656 --> 38:28.526
So, are the meds helping?

38:28.559 --> 38:30.561
'Cause you look terrible.

38:30.595 --> 38:33.564
Is that your professional
medical opinion?

38:33.598 --> 38:34.966
Kate...

38:34.999 --> 38:38.435
MS rears its ugly head
at the worst times.

38:38.469 --> 38:40.872
You just need to get more rest.

38:40.905 --> 38:42.840
Doctor's orders.

38:42.874 --> 38:45.476
And I'm your doctor.

38:45.510 --> 38:47.712
We have to stop
meeting like this.

38:53.050 --> 38:55.720
Pixelcon is 20 days away.

38:55.753 --> 38:57.088
What's the Internet
buzzing about?

38:57.121 --> 38:58.256
Playfield's new game,

38:58.288 --> 39:00.958
I hate every single thing
I'm hearing about this thing.

39:00.992 --> 39:02.994
Not good.
Definitely not good.

39:03.027 --> 39:05.696
I've... literally never been
more excited for a video game

39:05.730 --> 39:07.899
than I am for Xodus'
Alien Reaper.

39:07.932 --> 39:09.100
I need it now.

39:09.133 --> 39:10.735
Alien Reaper
is the kind of game

39:10.768 --> 39:12.870
that your best nightmares
are made of.

39:12.904 --> 39:14.672
I heard Xodus
spent 10 million dollars

39:14.705 --> 39:16.507
on the cut scenes alone.

39:16.541 --> 39:18.009
When you're dropping
that kind of cash on a game,

39:18.042 --> 39:20.343
it is impossible
for the indies to compete.

39:20.377 --> 39:22.345
Honestly, Playfield
is looking like a mess.

39:22.379 --> 39:23.446
No bueno, friends.

39:23.481 --> 39:25.616
Please, Playfield,
please be good.

39:25.650 --> 39:27.718
Be better than
you've been recently.

39:27.752 --> 39:29.787
- <i>You were so great...</i>
- Hey.

39:29.821 --> 39:30.955
- ... <i>back in the day.</i>
- What'cha looking at?

39:30.988 --> 39:33.925
Just getting nervous over
all the fans' expectations.

39:33.958 --> 39:35.893
Yeah, I get it.

39:35.927 --> 39:37.695
You don't want to
let anyone down.

39:37.728 --> 39:38.729
Yeah, does anyone?

39:38.763 --> 39:40.731
Eh, I'm kinda used to it.

39:40.765 --> 39:41.666
Believe me.

39:41.699 --> 39:43.601
Troy, I don't understand
your dumb poster!

39:43.634 --> 39:46.604
I hate you
for making me do this!

39:46.637 --> 39:50.107
Hey, let me show you something.

39:50.141 --> 39:52.009
Can I see your phone?

39:52.043 --> 39:53.544
Yeah.

39:53.578 --> 39:56.647
Cool, um...

39:56.681 --> 39:57.682
There.

39:57.715 --> 40:00.450
Check it out.

40:00.484 --> 40:02.787
What is it?

40:02.820 --> 40:05.656
It's a custom augmented
reality program

40:05.690 --> 40:06.991
for stage fright.

40:07.024 --> 40:08.125
Yeah, they say
the best thing to do

40:08.159 --> 40:10.595
is focus on one person
in a crowd.

40:10.628 --> 40:11.562
Find a friendly face

40:11.596 --> 40:14.065
and it's like
you're only talking to them.

40:14.098 --> 40:15.566
I didn't even know
they had those.

40:15.600 --> 40:16.601
No, they don't.

40:16.634 --> 40:18.536
But I... I built this one.

40:18.569 --> 40:22.640
For you.

40:22.673 --> 40:24.976
Where did you find the time?

40:25.009 --> 40:25.776
I made the time.

40:30.848 --> 40:33.651
Uh, I gotta...

40:33.684 --> 40:35.987
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

40:36.020 --> 40:37.722
Thank you.

40:41.692 --> 40:43.694
Yeah, yeah, come on in.

40:48.799 --> 40:50.101
So yeah, Troy,
that whole section

40:50.134 --> 40:51.936
was not covered
in the stand-up meeting.

40:51.969 --> 40:53.704
That doesn't factor in
what we've been working on.

40:53.738 --> 40:54.872
I have another question about...

40:54.906 --> 40:55.873
Please!

41:00.044 --> 41:02.880
Screw it.

41:04.482 --> 41:05.216
I know, it's...
it's a different...

41:05.249 --> 41:06.183
it's gonna be a different thing.

41:06.217 --> 41:07.752
Troy, we need to talk.

41:07.785 --> 41:09.520
I don't have
any time right now, Jimmy.

41:09.553 --> 41:11.656
There's a line.
And I'm at the top of it.

41:11.689 --> 41:14.025
I said we need to talk.

41:14.058 --> 41:16.727
Daddy?

41:16.761 --> 41:17.962
Emily, what are you doing here?

41:17.995 --> 41:19.563
I came with Grandpa.

41:19.597 --> 41:20.798
He's waiting in your office.

41:20.831 --> 41:23.701
Ah... okay.

41:23.734 --> 41:25.503
I'm gonna be right back.

41:25.536 --> 41:29.907
Em, you just wait there, okay?

41:32.143 --> 41:35.112
<i>Smashing, smashing, smashing.</i>

41:35.146 --> 41:38.549
<i>Smash, smash, smash.
Smashing.</i>

41:38.582 --> 41:40.584
Sir, you're early.

41:40.618 --> 41:42.987
Real estate operates
on its own timetable, Jimmy.

41:43.020 --> 41:45.523
I still can't believe
my only son

41:45.556 --> 41:48.059
plays video games for a living.

41:48.092 --> 41:50.094
When are you going to grow up
and get a real job?

41:50.127 --> 41:52.563
Dad, this is a real job.

41:52.596 --> 41:54.632
You know what, why don't you
come to Pixelcon next month

41:54.665 --> 41:55.933
and I'll show you what I can do.

41:55.967 --> 41:57.201
- Pixie cut?
- Pixelcon.

41:57.234 --> 41:59.937
It's a big video game convention
where I'm gonna debut the game

41:59.971 --> 42:01.172
I've been workin' on all year.

42:01.205 --> 42:03.841
One year?
On one game?

42:03.874 --> 42:06.277
This whole environment
makes me sick to my stomach.

42:06.310 --> 42:08.946
I just hope that Emily
doesn't...

42:10.614 --> 42:11.582
Oh, the hell with it.

42:11.615 --> 42:13.751
No, go on. Say it.

42:13.784 --> 42:15.753
You hope that Emily
doesn't what?

42:15.786 --> 42:18.622
I hope that she doesn't think

42:18.656 --> 42:21.692
this is how
the real world works.

42:31.669 --> 42:33.104
Hey Em, what've you got there?

42:33.137 --> 42:35.573
It's an N64 emulator of Zelda.

42:35.606 --> 42:37.241
Ocarina?

42:37.274 --> 42:39.910
Shigeru Miyamoto.

42:41.278 --> 42:43.981
Without him, open worlds
wouldn't even exist.

42:44.015 --> 42:45.316
Yeah, I heard
the first one was inspired

42:45.349 --> 42:47.251
by his love of spelunking.

42:47.284 --> 42:49.253
Well, the great designers
base their games

42:49.286 --> 42:53.557
on stuff they love,
and that man loved spelunking.

42:53.591 --> 42:56.727
Look, we need to
shift our focus.

42:56.761 --> 43:00.631
We need to build a playable
demo of Jackhouse.

43:00.664 --> 43:02.033
- What?
- It's much closer

43:02.066 --> 43:03.601
than World of Troy.

43:03.634 --> 43:04.769
Yort.

43:04.802 --> 43:05.669
Yeah, whatever.

43:05.703 --> 43:06.537
Look, if we don't finish
one of the games,

43:06.570 --> 43:08.272
we're not gonna have
anything to sell.

43:08.305 --> 43:09.173
I know that.

43:09.206 --> 43:12.843
Which is why
we have to finish Yort.

43:12.877 --> 43:15.579
Why don't you
want to work on my game?

43:15.613 --> 43:18.682
Jimmy, forget about the bugs
and the scalability for a second

43:18.716 --> 43:20.885
and just think about it.

43:20.918 --> 43:22.720
Who wants to play a game
where your only goal

43:22.753 --> 43:23.954
is to destroy houses?

43:23.988 --> 43:27.024
Oh, and I guess everybody
wants to be a magical tree slug

43:27.058 --> 43:31.028
flying through time
in search of a mystical beast?

43:31.062 --> 43:33.798
Well, kinda.

43:33.831 --> 43:35.833
This is the only job
I've ever had.

43:35.866 --> 43:37.134
I helped build this company.

43:37.168 --> 43:38.903
I have my own family now,

43:38.936 --> 43:42.073
and you are making me do
something I don't wanna do!

43:42.106 --> 43:43.774
Jimmy,
you have no mini-games,

43:43.808 --> 43:46.343
no subsections, no economy.

43:46.377 --> 43:48.913
Jackhammering
is your only core loop.

43:48.946 --> 43:51.148
It's like you forgot
what these games are all about.

43:57.755 --> 43:59.356
Em, come on.

44:04.361 --> 44:06.597
What's up, Jimmy?
Takin' a half day today?

44:17.708 --> 44:19.410
<i>You can keep your MOBAs</i>

44:19.443 --> 44:22.246
<i>and your first person shooters</i>

44:22.279 --> 44:24.381
<i>and you can shove
your battle royale</i>

44:24.415 --> 44:28.285
<i>where the sun don't shine.</i>

44:28.319 --> 44:31.822
<i>Forget MMOs and open worlds.</i>

44:31.856 --> 44:35.192
<i>Here at Playfield Games,
there's a new kind of game,</i>

44:35.226 --> 44:37.962
<i>from a new kind of mastermind.</i>

44:37.995 --> 44:41.232
<i>Playfield is about to
change games forever.</i>

44:41.265 --> 44:42.700
<i>And what of the competition?</i>

44:42.733 --> 44:44.135
Xodus sucks.

44:44.168 --> 44:46.170
<i>♪ Xodus sucks ♪</i>

44:46.203 --> 44:48.172

45:06.323 --> 45:09.260
Oh, oh, upload and boom.

45:14.932 --> 45:17.201
Hey, you got a sec?

45:17.234 --> 45:18.836
Yeah, yeah, I do.
I do have a sec.

45:18.869 --> 45:20.171
I have a ton of secs.

45:20.204 --> 45:22.373
In fact, I have
like all the secs.

45:25.843 --> 45:27.411
Um... that is not what I meant.

45:27.444 --> 45:31.749
You do a really
good job at making things weird.

45:31.782 --> 45:32.917
Thank you.

45:32.950 --> 45:36.220
I just came to tell you,
I signed up for my first solo.

45:36.253 --> 45:38.822
Amazing.

45:40.824 --> 45:42.159
Are you okay?

45:42.193 --> 45:45.029
Just... everyone's falling
so far behind

45:45.062 --> 45:48.032
and I just...
I can't get them to get it.

45:48.065 --> 45:50.468
Yeah, I heard.

45:50.502 --> 45:51.902
So, what's your plan?

45:51.936 --> 45:53.771
Well, since I can't
get them to understand,

45:53.804 --> 45:55.873
I'll fix the core
rendering engine myself tonight

45:55.906 --> 45:56.675
then probably just...

45:56.707 --> 45:59.443
- Hey, hey!
- ...work a bit more...

45:59.477 --> 46:02.980
I've only been here
like two weeks so,

46:03.013 --> 46:04.381
maybe I don't know,

46:04.415 --> 46:08.752
but I've never seen you
ask for help from anyone.

46:09.353 --> 46:10.321
Troy?

46:11.822 --> 46:12.923
Troy.

46:12.957 --> 46:16.260
Maybe start now.

46:16.293 --> 46:17.895
Okay, listen,
this is a long shot,

46:17.928 --> 46:19.531
but I've been going over
Jimmy's Jackhouse maps

46:19.564 --> 46:21.298
and if we convert them for Yort,

46:21.332 --> 46:23.267
we could get six levels
in a week.

46:23.300 --> 46:24.802
Really? That much that fast?

46:24.835 --> 46:25.970
Which means...

46:26.003 --> 46:29.273
We would finish my game
this week.

46:29.306 --> 46:31.442
That would be awesome.

46:31.476 --> 46:33.344
Okay, well, I'll get Marie
started on that.

46:33.377 --> 46:35.112
Thanks, Laura.

46:35.145 --> 46:39.817
I really thought
you didn't like me.

46:39.850 --> 46:40.985
I do not.

46:41.018 --> 46:42.554
I'm doing this for Kate.

46:42.587 --> 46:45.557
Password?

46:45.590 --> 46:48.526
Hey, Marie,
I need your help.

46:48.560 --> 46:50.528
Oh my gosh, finally.

46:50.562 --> 46:51.563
I knew that
if I was just patient,

46:51.596 --> 46:53.163
I would eventually get my chance

46:53.197 --> 46:54.798
and, hey, I have some
great ideas for Yort.

46:54.832 --> 46:55.766
I'm sure you do,

46:55.799 --> 46:56.735
but what I really need you
to do right now

46:56.767 --> 46:58.369
is to rework the storylines
from Jackhouse

46:58.402 --> 47:00.472
to sync with Yort.

47:00.505 --> 47:01.506
Gotcha.

47:01.539 --> 47:05.042
Okay, so I'll just file away
all these concepts

47:05.075 --> 47:07.077
that I've been brainstorming.

47:07.111 --> 47:09.380
Thanks, Marie!

47:09.413 --> 47:12.149
What the...

47:12.182 --> 47:13.851
What the...?

47:13.884 --> 47:15.587
Hey, sorry about that, Lyndon.

47:15.620 --> 47:17.254
- What is all this?
- Our financials.

47:17.288 --> 47:19.990
I gotta fax them over to Xodus.

47:20.024 --> 47:22.426
We don't have a fax machine.

47:22.460 --> 47:25.129
Well, what've I been using?

47:25.162 --> 47:27.264
Why are you sending
our financials to Xodus?

47:27.298 --> 47:31.335
Son, how else is your mom
gonna keep your house?

47:33.904 --> 47:37.141
Yeah.

47:39.376 --> 47:41.412
Mom, you had to mortgage
our house?

47:41.445 --> 47:42.913
<i>I'm sorry, honey.</i>

47:42.946 --> 47:43.914
<i>We're out of money.</i>

47:43.947 --> 47:46.150
<i>I had to buy us time
to get to Pixelcon.</i>

47:46.183 --> 47:47.885
As long as you don't
take that Xodus deal.

47:47.918 --> 47:50.087
Yort is going to be ready.

47:50.120 --> 47:52.389
Laura and Marie
are finally starting to get it

47:52.423 --> 47:55.593
and even Jimmy and I
are kind of bonding.

47:55.627 --> 47:58.563
So... don't worry, Mom.

47:58.596 --> 48:00.197
<i>You're dealing with so much.</i>

48:00.230 --> 48:02.500
<i>I'm sorry, but my doctor
won't let me go to the office</i>

48:02.534 --> 48:04.569
<i>until this flare-up subsides.</i>

48:04.602 --> 48:06.504
<i>I wish I could be there
with you, but I trust you.</i>

48:06.538 --> 48:07.938
Thanks.

48:07.971 --> 48:10.441
Okay, bye. Love you.

48:26.156 --> 48:27.492
Oh, no.

48:27.525 --> 48:29.093
<i>Xodus Sucks.</i>

48:29.126 --> 48:31.061
<i>Xodus Sucks.</i>

48:31.095 --> 48:32.930

48:32.963 --> 48:34.198

48:45.109 --> 48:48.112
<i>Playfield is about to change.</i>

<i>Xodus sucks.</i>

48:52.517 --> 48:54.586
Oh, crap!

48:54.619 --> 48:55.986
Nick!

48:56.019 --> 48:58.490
Nick, what did you do?

48:58.523 --> 48:59.557
Awesome, right?

48:59.591 --> 49:01.058
Thousands of views already!

49:01.091 --> 49:05.295
I specifically told you
not to do this!

49:05.329 --> 49:06.296
Are you like
actually mad at me?

49:06.330 --> 49:07.297
Yes!

49:07.331 --> 49:11.435
You just made my life
like 10 times harder.

49:11.469 --> 49:13.237
Well, how can I fix it?

49:13.270 --> 49:14.204
What can I do?

49:14.238 --> 49:15.072
Nothing!

49:15.105 --> 49:17.207
Because there's nothing
you can do.

49:21.746 --> 49:24.314
I'm going back to school.

49:24.348 --> 49:26.417
Nick...

49:26.450 --> 49:28.952
Nick. I meant right now.

49:28.986 --> 49:30.254
I was just trying to help.

49:30.287 --> 49:31.922
Nick, come on.

49:43.367 --> 49:45.202
Jimmy? What?

49:45.235 --> 49:48.138
Okay, I'll do your
personality quiz.

49:50.542 --> 49:53.076
"Which <i>Friends</i>
character are you?"

50:04.054 --> 50:05.355
Yes, okay.

50:07.357 --> 50:08.626
Who the hell is Chandler?

50:10.294 --> 50:12.697
Ah, great, of course,
beachball of death.

50:32.416 --> 50:34.719
No. No, no, no,
no, no, no, no!

50:34.752 --> 50:35.887
Marie, what's up?

50:35.920 --> 50:37.455
My computer just froze up
in the middle of everything,

50:37.489 --> 50:39.223
and it's not letting me reboot.

50:39.256 --> 50:41.358
Uh, me... me too,
the same thing.

50:41.391 --> 50:42.694
Troy, what did you do?

50:42.727 --> 50:43.795
What do you mean?
My computer froze,

50:43.828 --> 50:45.563
so I was just going to
the kitchen to get a snack.

50:45.597 --> 50:47.264
It's not frozen,
it's a worm.

50:47.297 --> 50:48.700
What?
No, that's not possible.

50:48.733 --> 50:50.100
You set up your computer
to be the hub

50:50.133 --> 50:53.036
of the dedicated network,
remember?

50:53.070 --> 50:56.641
Oh, no.

50:59.811 --> 51:01.513
It's stuck on this webpage.

51:01.546 --> 51:03.313
Laura's right!
You downloaded a worm!

51:03.347 --> 51:04.314
It's gonna eat
through our network

51:04.348 --> 51:05.215
and destroy all of our hardware.

51:05.249 --> 51:07.117
- We need to cut the power!
- Right, okay!

51:08.385 --> 51:09.386
Not your power!

51:09.419 --> 51:14.391
We need to cut the power
to the whole building!

51:14.424 --> 51:15.527
A worm?

51:41.486 --> 51:43.688
Did... did we stop it in time?

51:43.721 --> 51:44.856
How could this happen?

51:44.889 --> 51:47.291
Troy, what were you doing
before you left your office?

51:48.425 --> 51:49.527
Nothing. I'd...

51:49.561 --> 51:52.429
I'd opened an email from Jimmy
that had a link in it.

51:52.463 --> 51:53.397
He wouldn't.

51:54.532 --> 51:56.166
- No way.
- He seemed pretty pissed

51:56.199 --> 51:58.168
right before he left.

51:58.201 --> 51:59.303
He left this note.

52:06.511 --> 52:08.412
Lyndon,
go flip the breaker again.

52:08.445 --> 52:10.213
Troy, don't touch anything.

52:10.247 --> 52:12.115
Let's see
how much damage was done.

52:12.149 --> 52:13.417
Breaker.

52:40.578 --> 52:42.747
The computers
are completely fried.

52:42.780 --> 52:44.482
Even the backup servers.

52:44.515 --> 52:46.651
Everything's gone.

52:46.684 --> 52:48.720
But, uh... does this mean...

52:48.753 --> 52:51.823
We went from two games to none.

52:51.856 --> 52:55.460
We... we gotta tell Kate.

52:58.663 --> 53:00.665
I'll tell her.

53:00.698 --> 53:02.332
Huh.

53:20.718 --> 53:23.253
<i>Troy, honey, is that you?</i>

53:23.286 --> 53:24.555
Yeah, Mom, it's me.

53:32.295 --> 53:35.800
I'm sorry I've been offline
for such a long time now.

53:37.468 --> 53:42.205
I haven't... I haven't had
a flare-up this bad in forever.

53:49.914 --> 53:51.348
How's Yort going?

53:52.449 --> 53:53.484
It's good.

53:53.518 --> 53:55.820
I just wish
I could help more.

53:55.853 --> 53:57.955
Is there anything
you want to talk about?

53:57.989 --> 54:00.758
Um... not really.

54:02.894 --> 54:05.630
I just wanted to make sure
you're feeling better

54:05.663 --> 54:08.466
so you can present
at the main event.

54:08.499 --> 54:10.935
Are you sure you'll be okay
without me until then?

54:10.968 --> 54:13.004
Yeah, I got it.

54:13.037 --> 54:16.306
I was just... just coming
to get a change of clothes

54:16.339 --> 54:18.275
and I'll head back
to the office.

54:20.611 --> 54:21.579
Love you, Mom.

54:21.612 --> 54:22.680
Love you.

Got a sec?

55:12.563 --> 55:13.396
It looks like you're doing

55:13.430 --> 55:15.533
some serious housecleaning
out there.

55:15.566 --> 55:16.667
Everyone's quitting.

55:17.902 --> 55:19.637
That's... that's not good.

55:21.973 --> 55:23.741
Hey, maybe this will
make you feel better.

55:25.342 --> 55:30.047
It's a thumb drive,
and a mix tape.

55:30.081 --> 55:33.084
I wrote and performed it.

55:33.117 --> 55:34.619
It's the theme song
for your game.

55:36.721 --> 55:38.288
There's no more Yort, Paige.

55:40.625 --> 55:42.392
There's no more
Playfield Games either.

55:43.628 --> 55:44.796
What?

55:45.863 --> 55:48.466
<i>Hey, everyone!
Come check this out!</i>

55:56.874 --> 55:58.576
Look at this old DVD I found.

56:01.045 --> 56:03.948
That is classic Jimmy -
frosted tips.

56:03.981 --> 56:05.950

at least 10 years old.

56:05.983 --> 56:06.918
Around 12.

56:06.951 --> 56:08.853
It's right after
we released our first game.

56:08.886 --> 56:10.621
This is Playfield Games history.

56:10.655 --> 56:12.523
<i>Hey, hey, Mayfielders!</i>

56:13.691 --> 56:15.459

56:33.077 --> 56:34.111
- <i>That's right, honey.</i>
- Yeah.

56:34.145 --> 56:35.345
Oh!

56:35.378 --> 56:38.816
<i>You know, it wasn't until
I shut this and opened these</i>

56:38.850 --> 56:41.652
<i>that this game
became something special.</i>

56:41.686 --> 56:43.821
<i>It's so much more
than just a game.</i>

56:43.855 --> 56:46.123
<i>It's about
each and every one of you.</i>

56:46.157 --> 56:47.725
<i>It's about all of us.</i>

56:49.460 --> 56:51.696
<i>And that's why
we've decided to change</i>

56:51.729 --> 56:54.465
<i>the name of our company
from Mayfield Games to...</i>

56:54.498 --> 56:55.600
<i>drumroll, Lyndon!</i>

56:58.636 --> 57:00.972
<i>Playfield Games!</i>

57:01.005 --> 57:02.439
<i>Woo-hoo!</i>

57:04.108 --> 57:06.711
<i>Yes, T-shirts, Jimmy.</i>

57:06.744 --> 57:09.580
<i>And I hope, uh, we hope,
that this is a place</i>

57:09.614 --> 57:11.115
<i>you can always feel at home.</i>

57:11.148 --> 57:14.085
<i>If you're at Playfield,
you always will be.</i>

57:14.118 --> 57:16.153
<i>We're never gonna let you down.</i>

57:16.187 --> 57:17.688
<i>Not going to let you go,</i>

57:17.722 --> 57:20.423
<i>because, you guys,
you're our family.</i>

57:20.458 --> 57:21.993
<i>Each and every one of you.</i>

57:22.026 --> 57:24.996
<i>Lyndon, Marie, Jimmy, Laura.</i>

57:25.029 --> 57:27.531
<i>I mean, we wouldn't be here
without you.</i>

57:27.565 --> 57:28.733
<i>And we would never want to be.</i>

57:28.766 --> 57:30.935
<i>And we hope that
someday our son will get to work</i>

57:30.968 --> 57:33.604
<i>with people as incredible
as you guys.</i>

57:33.638 --> 57:35.706
<i>What do you think, Troy,
of our new name?</i>

57:35.740 --> 57:39.110
<i>Playfield Games rules!</i>

57:43.247 --> 57:44.749
<i>What do you think, Troy?</i>

57:44.782 --> 57:46.717
<i>Do you want to come work
with Daddy someday?</i>

57:46.751 --> 57:48.920
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- <i>Yeah, alright.</i>

58:43.741 --> 58:45.042
What's this...?

59:23.881 --> 59:25.016
Hey, Nick.

59:27.351 --> 59:29.020
Hey.
What are you doin' here?

59:29.053 --> 59:30.221
I came looking for you.

59:30.254 --> 59:31.589
Your... your mom said
you'd be here.

59:33.124 --> 59:34.825
Okay, well...

59:34.859 --> 59:38.295
I just stopped by to see
if I had somethin' here.

59:38.329 --> 59:41.699
So, it's not like I'm here
at school for fun... whatever.

59:41.732 --> 59:43.000
No, no, of course not.

59:44.201 --> 59:47.872
So, found it.

59:47.905 --> 59:49.206
It's here.

59:50.941 --> 59:52.109
So um... yeah...

59:54.078 --> 59:56.714
I'm just gonna go...

59:56.747 --> 59:59.350
and hang out
with my other new friends.

59:59.383 --> 1:00:02.887
You know that video got me
10,000 new subscribers?

1:00:04.321 --> 1:00:06.724
They call themselves
the Nicknames.

1:00:06.757 --> 1:00:07.825
Catchy.

1:00:07.858 --> 1:00:09.026
Yeah.

1:00:10.995 --> 1:00:12.263
Hey, Nick.
I... I get it.

1:00:12.296 --> 1:00:14.899
You were only making that video
'cause you wanted to help me.

1:00:14.932 --> 1:00:17.001
I was in way over my head
at Playfield, all right?

1:00:17.034 --> 1:00:18.736
I shouldn't have said
any of the things

1:00:18.769 --> 1:00:22.039
that I said to you...
or to anyone.

1:00:22.073 --> 1:00:23.240
I made the video.

1:00:23.274 --> 1:00:25.176
You told me not to.
I did it anyway.

1:00:26.844 --> 1:00:28.245
That's my bad.
I'm sorry.

1:00:28.279 --> 1:00:30.915
Nick, I just, I didn't know
who else to turn to.

1:00:30.948 --> 1:00:32.683
Yort is screwed.

1:00:32.716 --> 1:00:33.918
I downloaded this worm,

1:00:33.951 --> 1:00:35.886
and... and our computers
just got fried.

1:00:35.920 --> 1:00:38.155
I told you
not to visit those sites.

1:00:38.189 --> 1:00:40.624
Nick, we lost the code
to our games.

1:00:40.658 --> 1:00:41.759
The entire code?

1:00:41.792 --> 1:00:43.694
Yeah.

1:00:43.727 --> 1:00:46.997
I just... I need some help
figuring out what to do next.

1:00:48.432 --> 1:00:49.233
You said you need help?

1:00:49.266 --> 1:00:51.702
- Yeah. Yes.
- You said you need help.

1:00:51.735 --> 1:00:53.270
I got your help!
Come on!

1:00:55.372 --> 1:00:56.640
Oh!

1:00:57.908 --> 1:00:59.343
Hey, Mr. Diehl.
Mr. Diehl?

1:00:59.376 --> 1:01:00.811
Ahhh, Nick!

1:01:00.845 --> 1:01:01.912
Mayfield?

1:01:01.946 --> 1:01:03.114
I thought you were suspended?

1:01:03.147 --> 1:01:04.782
It's spring break.

1:01:04.815 --> 1:01:06.016
Again?

1:01:06.050 --> 1:01:09.220
Look, Mr. Diehl sneaks away
here to play your video games.

1:01:09.253 --> 1:01:11.155
Dude, those games were
supposed to be just for us.

1:01:11.188 --> 1:01:12.323
He's like a Troy game junkie.

1:01:12.356 --> 1:01:14.391
Ahh!
I'm a total Troy game junkie!

1:01:14.425 --> 1:01:16.961
And I was a big fan
of your dad's.

1:01:16.994 --> 1:01:21.098
Hey, look. Remember?
He was the lead guy on Athena 9.

1:01:21.132 --> 1:01:23.234
I was the lead guy.
He said I was the lead guy.

1:01:23.267 --> 1:01:24.969
And then Xodus laid me off.

1:01:25.002 --> 1:01:26.904
Get it in writing,
that's what I learned

1:01:26.937 --> 1:01:28.339
from that experience
right there.

1:01:28.372 --> 1:01:30.774
No word, no severance package,
nothing.

1:01:30.808 --> 1:01:32.810
Then I had to go home
to my wife... oooh,

1:01:32.843 --> 1:01:35.279
this... this woman
is something else...

1:01:35.312 --> 1:01:37.381
Oh my god, could
you just tell him the good part!

1:01:37.414 --> 1:01:38.449
The games.

1:01:38.483 --> 1:01:41.218
The... oh, right, right.

1:01:41.252 --> 1:01:43.721
Well, while he was VP
of marketing at your company...

1:01:43.754 --> 1:01:45.122
Is that what you told him?

1:01:45.156 --> 1:01:48.392
...I begged him to give me a copy
of the code of your new games.

1:01:50.995 --> 1:01:53.097
Wh... wait, which...
which ones?

1:01:53.130 --> 1:01:55.299
You know,
the Yort and Jackhouse.

1:01:55.332 --> 1:01:56.333
I just wanted to see 'em.

1:01:56.367 --> 1:01:58.836
I didn't share 'em with anyone.
I promise you.

1:01:58.869 --> 1:02:00.137
Wait, so, you have
a copy of the code?

1:02:00.171 --> 1:02:03.107
Yeah, yeah,
it's right there.

1:02:03.140 --> 1:02:04.141
Nick, you gave him
a copy of the code?

1:02:04.175 --> 1:02:06.478
That's what
I was trying to tell you!

1:02:06.511 --> 1:02:08.345
- That's it!.
- Okay.

1:02:08.379 --> 1:02:10.314
Alright, tone it down.

1:02:10.347 --> 1:02:11.415
- The computers!
- Ahhh!

1:02:11.448 --> 1:02:12.551
Hey.

1:02:12.584 --> 1:02:14.318
You're not talking about
those computers we won - okay?

1:02:14.351 --> 1:02:15.886
Oh my god, these kids.

1:02:17.988 --> 1:02:18.989
Can you guys
get these up and running?

1:02:19.023 --> 1:02:20.424
- Uh-huh, all right.
- I've got some work to do.

1:02:20.458 --> 1:02:22.026
And call everyone.

1:02:22.059 --> 1:02:23.427
All right.

1:02:35.473 --> 1:02:36.373
They got it!

1:02:36.407 --> 1:02:38.209
Yort and Jackhouse!
They got them both.

1:02:38.242 --> 1:02:39.276
You manually
backed up the files?

1:02:39.310 --> 1:02:41.245
No, no, it wasn't me.
It was Nick and Mr. Diehl,

1:02:41.278 --> 1:02:42.514
but do you guys think
it's possible for us

1:02:42.547 --> 1:02:43.548
to get back up
and running in time?

1:02:43.582 --> 1:02:45.883
With the right hardware,
but there's only one guy

1:02:45.916 --> 1:02:47.384
who knows how to
manipulate those maps.

1:02:47.418 --> 1:02:50.421
And that guy
is currently selling condos.

1:02:52.790 --> 1:02:54.291
Meet me at the high school
in an hour!

1:02:54.325 --> 1:02:55.859
Ah.

1:02:55.893 --> 1:02:56.994
I-I better call Uber.

1:03:14.178 --> 1:03:15.547
Are those pigs in a blanket?

1:03:15.580 --> 1:03:18.249
For prospective buyers only.

1:03:18.282 --> 1:03:20.050
How did you find me?

1:03:20.084 --> 1:03:21.885
Your dad's flyers
are everywhere.

1:03:26.423 --> 1:03:27.958
Okay, why did you find me?

1:03:29.093 --> 1:03:31.061
Jimmy,
I never listened to you

1:03:31.095 --> 1:03:32.530
and that was...
that was a mistake.

1:03:32.564 --> 1:03:35.165
And I realize now just how
terrible I was to you,

1:03:35.199 --> 1:03:37.401
and I'm really sorry.

1:03:37.434 --> 1:03:39.370
You're sorry?

1:03:39.403 --> 1:03:41.506
Wow.

1:03:41.539 --> 1:03:42.439
Well, now it's your turn.

1:03:44.208 --> 1:03:46.277
What am I sorry for?

1:03:46.310 --> 1:03:49.313
For sending that email
with that dumb personality quiz

1:03:49.346 --> 1:03:51.915
that almost destroyed
the entire company?

1:03:51.949 --> 1:03:53.250
Personality...?
What email?

1:03:53.284 --> 1:03:54.918
What are you talking about?

1:03:54.952 --> 1:03:57.354
You sent an email that
infected all of our computers.

1:03:57.388 --> 1:04:00.424
No, I didn't.
I would never do that.

1:04:00.458 --> 1:04:02.326
Well, if it wasn't you,
then who did it?

1:04:02.359 --> 1:04:03.193
I don't care
what the DNA says,

1:04:03.227 --> 1:04:05.829
I'm denying paternity,
all right? Jeez.

1:04:07.898 --> 1:04:12.202
Hey Rick, I hate to interrupt,
but... it worked.

1:04:12.236 --> 1:04:13.471
They bit on the Trojan worm?

1:04:13.505 --> 1:04:14.539
Yeah. Ha!

1:04:14.572 --> 1:04:16.307
"Which <i>Friends</i>
character are you?"

1:04:16.340 --> 1:04:18.876
That whole company
is a bunch of Joeys.

1:04:18.909 --> 1:04:20.512
Have marketing start prepping
a retro release

1:04:20.545 --> 1:04:22.413
for all of Playfield's
old games.

1:04:22.446 --> 1:04:24.616
Now Kate's gonna
have to take my deal.

1:04:24.649 --> 1:04:26.884
<i>Ándale!</i> That means now!

1:04:26.917 --> 1:04:27.818
Si, señor.

1:04:28.886 --> 1:04:30.054
Even if you didn't
send that email,

1:04:30.087 --> 1:04:32.156
you still abandoned us.

1:04:32.189 --> 1:04:33.957
I abandoned you?

1:04:33.991 --> 1:04:35.292
Did you even think
for one second

1:04:35.326 --> 1:04:37.361
what could happen to Emily
if Playfield closed?

1:04:37.394 --> 1:04:40.431
Because I did,
every single day.

1:04:40.465 --> 1:04:44.268
You were awful to me.
And you're killing the company!

1:04:44.301 --> 1:04:46.170
I didn't think
about those things.

1:04:46.203 --> 1:04:48.205
I mean, awful!

1:04:48.238 --> 1:04:49.206
Pig in a blanket?

1:04:56.280 --> 1:04:59.083
Troy, you're an amazing coder.

1:05:02.654 --> 1:05:04.522
Jackhouse!

1:05:04.556 --> 1:05:06.624
I may have let
some personal issues

1:05:06.658 --> 1:05:08.460
cloud my judgment.

1:05:10.394 --> 1:05:13.498
Video games. That's all
I've ever wanted to do

1:05:13.531 --> 1:05:15.099
my entire...

1:05:16.967 --> 1:05:18.536
my entire life.

1:05:18.570 --> 1:05:20.237
Make video games, you know?

1:05:20.270 --> 1:05:24.542
Make just... one great game.

1:05:24.576 --> 1:05:26.110
Same.

1:05:26.143 --> 1:05:27.077
Yeah...

1:05:28.379 --> 1:05:31.649
Well... I better
get back to work.

1:05:31.683 --> 1:05:33.417
You're right. You should.

1:05:33.450 --> 1:05:34.719
We lucked out.

1:05:34.753 --> 1:05:36.488
We secured a copy of the code
before that email destroyed it.

1:05:36.521 --> 1:05:38.623
But, we need you.

1:05:38.656 --> 1:05:41.325
Wait, so you still have
a chance to launch at Pixelcon?

1:05:41.358 --> 1:05:43.961
Yeah, I think so.

1:05:43.994 --> 1:05:46.196
If you'll come back and help.

1:05:46.230 --> 1:05:49.133
Jimmy, what the hell
are you doing?

1:05:49.166 --> 1:05:52.169
Dad, sorry, um, you remember
my old boss, Troy Mayfield?

1:05:52.202 --> 1:05:54.506
Hey, High School Musical.
How's it hanging, buddy?

1:05:54.539 --> 1:05:55.939
Hey, I'm the only one
allowed to call him that.

1:05:55.973 --> 1:05:56.775
At least he's a kid.

1:05:56.808 --> 1:05:58.375
He's expected to play
video games.

1:05:58.409 --> 1:06:00.177
Make video games!

1:06:00.210 --> 1:06:02.079
You need to get back to work.

1:06:02.112 --> 1:06:03.947
You're right, Dad.

1:06:03.981 --> 1:06:04.915
I do.

1:06:09.987 --> 1:06:13.257
Look, I am actively terrible
at selling real estate.

1:06:13.290 --> 1:06:14.291
Video game design,

1:06:14.324 --> 1:06:15.993
that's all I've ever
wanted to do with my life.

1:06:16.026 --> 1:06:18.295
And apparently,
I'm pretty good at it.

1:06:18.328 --> 1:06:21.965
You go and you take
these snacks to those buyers

1:06:21.999 --> 1:06:23.601
or I'm not gonna
help you out anymore.

1:06:23.635 --> 1:06:27.237
It's okay, Dad.
Thank you.

1:06:27.271 --> 1:06:28.272
Let's go.

1:06:39.416 --> 1:06:41.351
It wasn't Jimmy.
He didn't send the email.

1:06:41.385 --> 1:06:44.254
Hey, I can speak for myself.

1:06:44.288 --> 1:06:47.291
It wasn't me.
I didn't send the email.

1:06:47.324 --> 1:06:49.092
I, for one,
never doubted you.

1:06:49.126 --> 1:06:51.061
I doubted you
one hundred percent.

1:06:51.094 --> 1:06:52.262
What's an email?

1:06:52.296 --> 1:06:54.466
Ladies. Gentlemen.

1:06:54.499 --> 1:06:56.366
We've lost a lot of time.

1:06:56.400 --> 1:06:58.302
Well, then,
there's no time to lose.

1:06:58.335 --> 1:06:59.236
How can we help?

1:06:59.269 --> 1:07:01.205
We called in
some reinforcements!

1:07:07.377 --> 1:07:08.445
What's your idea, Troy?

1:07:10.482 --> 1:07:12.617
What do you guys think
we should do?

1:07:12.650 --> 1:07:14.486
You're asking us?

1:07:14.519 --> 1:07:16.788
Yeah, we're all
Playfield Games, right?

1:07:16.821 --> 1:07:19.691
Zoey, Billy, even Mr. Diehl.

1:07:19.724 --> 1:07:21.726
So, I want to hear
you guys speak up.

1:07:21.759 --> 1:07:23.193
It's just time that I listen.

1:07:24.596 --> 1:07:27.097
Well, we can't
compete with Xodus

1:07:27.130 --> 1:07:28.766
on graphics and sound.

1:07:28.800 --> 1:07:31.736
We need to find something that
real gamers really want to play.

1:07:31.769 --> 1:07:33.036
I was thinking...

1:07:34.572 --> 1:07:35.640
Forget it.

1:07:35.673 --> 1:07:37.542
No, Marie, what's up?

1:07:37.575 --> 1:07:39.744
What if we did that?

1:07:39.777 --> 1:07:41.411
Did what?

1:07:41.445 --> 1:07:43.247
We get the players to play...

1:07:43.280 --> 1:07:46.049
and... code with us.

1:07:46.083 --> 1:07:49.052
So, we give them the tools
to build the world of the game,

1:07:49.086 --> 1:07:52.757
and then, building the world
becomes the game.

1:07:52.790 --> 1:07:54.258
All right.
Well, you want...

1:07:58.763 --> 1:08:00.732
...you want to get them
to do this, right?

1:08:00.765 --> 1:08:01.866
But how are we going to do that

1:08:01.900 --> 1:08:04.134
if these gamers have never even
seen a line of code,

1:08:04.167 --> 1:08:05.269
never mind written one?

1:08:05.302 --> 1:08:09.339
Uh, actually, Jimmy,
your map editor for Jackhouse

1:08:09.373 --> 1:08:10.708
is pretty powerful...

1:08:10.742 --> 1:08:13.076
Right, right, right, Mayfield.

1:08:13.110 --> 1:08:14.278
Yeah.

1:08:14.311 --> 1:08:19.383
So, we include the editor
in the executable of the game.

1:08:19.416 --> 1:08:20.618
I love this!

1:08:20.652 --> 1:08:22.452
I get it.

1:08:22.487 --> 1:08:24.288
We use the existing
architecture like you said...

1:08:24.321 --> 1:08:25.355
- Ah.
- But then...

1:09:42.867 --> 1:09:43.801
Yeah, okay.

1:09:45.937 --> 1:09:48.506
Hey, Mom.
Mom, you're here.

1:09:48.539 --> 1:09:49.507
Hey.

1:09:50.541 --> 1:09:52.275
My doctor
gave me the green light.

1:09:52.309 --> 1:09:53.811
But you're good?
You're okay?

1:09:53.845 --> 1:09:56.514
Yeah.
Honey, what's going on?

1:09:56.547 --> 1:09:58.750
It's a long story.

1:09:58.783 --> 1:10:01.318
We're actually not going
to demo Jackhouse or Yort.

1:10:01.351 --> 1:10:02.887
We married the best parts
of both games,

1:10:02.920 --> 1:10:05.355
and so now we're calling it...

1:10:05.389 --> 1:10:06.390
Brainstorm!

1:10:08.358 --> 1:10:09.694
I figured out
how to use Jimmy's maps.

1:10:09.727 --> 1:10:11.496
They work perfectly
with Brainstorm.

1:10:11.529 --> 1:10:12.964
It's the only game
that turns open source coding

1:10:12.997 --> 1:10:14.465
into the actual
gaming experience.

1:10:14.499 --> 1:10:16.266
Yeah,
and everyone in the world

1:10:16.299 --> 1:10:19.436
can play Brainstorm together,
it's pretty cool.

1:10:25.943 --> 1:10:27.779
Is this one of
your dad's old binders?

1:10:29.246 --> 1:10:30.213
Yeah.

1:10:32.449 --> 1:10:34.384
Where did you find it?

1:10:34.418 --> 1:10:37.689
It just kind of showed up
when I needed him most.

1:10:49.567 --> 1:10:50.501
I love it.

1:10:52.402 --> 1:10:54.839
This is what Playfield
is all about.

1:10:55.807 --> 1:10:59.342
I'm very proud of you guys.
But, I have to be honest.

1:10:59.376 --> 1:11:01.979
If this game
doesn't really move,

1:11:02.013 --> 1:11:05.616
then we've got to
sell the company...

1:11:05.650 --> 1:11:06.884
or shut it down.

1:11:06.918 --> 1:11:09.654
We know. Lyndon
can't keep a secret.

1:11:09.687 --> 1:11:11.589
Errr... uh... errrr...

1:11:11.622 --> 1:11:15.560
Okay. Well, do you think

1:11:15.593 --> 1:11:19.530
that this game is really
worth risking it all?

1:11:19.564 --> 1:11:20.898
- Hell, yeah.
- Yeah!

1:11:20.932 --> 1:11:22.633
Well, I'm not
working for Xodus.

1:11:23.835 --> 1:11:25.402
Jimmy?

1:11:25.435 --> 1:11:26.436
I think it is.

1:11:27.705 --> 1:11:28.706
Okay.

1:11:29.640 --> 1:11:32.877
I have never gone wrong
by trusting my family.

1:11:32.910 --> 1:11:36.748
So, let's show the world
what we can do.

1:11:37.849 --> 1:11:39.449
All right, let's go!

1:11:42.086 --> 1:11:43.588
Brainstorm shirts for everyone!

1:11:47.058 --> 1:11:50.427
Jimmy, what's this game
all about, anyway?

1:11:50.461 --> 1:11:51.662
We'll show you more
on the way to Pixelcon.

1:11:51.696 --> 1:11:53.698
But, you're going to love it.

All right, just-just laugh

1:12:39.477 --> 1:12:40.745

really funny.

1:12:40.778 --> 1:12:42.547

1:13:17.582 --> 1:13:19.684
Troy, get over here!

1:13:19.717 --> 1:13:21.018
I can't get the demo to boot up.

1:13:21.052 --> 1:13:21.886
It worked this morning.

1:13:21.919 --> 1:13:23.521
- What? What's wrong?
- No idea.

1:13:23.554 --> 1:13:25.388
I've tried everything.
I can't connect!

1:13:25.422 --> 1:13:26.457
What do you guys think
we should do?

1:13:26.490 --> 1:13:27.825
Just fix it, Troy!

1:13:27.859 --> 1:13:28.926

I'm Kate Mayfield,
CEO of Playfield Games.

1:17:15.052 --> 1:17:19.723
That was the theme song
for our latest game, Brainstorm!

1:17:24.929 --> 1:17:29.667
So now, I would like to
bring out our lead designer...

1:17:29.700 --> 1:17:30.968
- That's you.
- That's you.

1:17:31.001 --> 1:17:33.704
Well, our lead designers.

1:17:33.737 --> 1:17:36.740
And have them
walk you through the demo.

1:17:36.774 --> 1:17:40.811
Please welcome
Jimmy Tisdale and Troy Mayfield.

1:17:43.013 --> 1:17:44.682
Hey, everybody.

1:17:44.715 --> 1:17:48.052
This entire world
and the gameplay

1:17:48.085 --> 1:17:51.989
has been designed
to encourage teamwork...

1:17:52.022 --> 1:17:58.162
giving you unprecedented access
to our content creation tools.

1:17:58.195 --> 1:18:01.765
Actually...
should we call everyone up?

1:18:01.799 --> 1:18:03.434
Let's do it.

1:18:03.468 --> 1:18:06.137
Uh, sorry, if I could
just get the entire team

1:18:06.170 --> 1:18:07.238

1:18:07.271 --> 1:18:08.405
Hey guys,

1:18:08.439 --> 1:18:11.075
Laura, Marie, Lyndon...

1:18:11.108 --> 1:18:12.810

1:18:16.380 --> 1:18:17.715

1:18:19.016 --> 1:18:21.919
To be honest, we don't know
how this game ends.

1:18:21.952 --> 1:18:24.889
We're leaving that up to you
because in effect,

1:18:24.922 --> 1:18:27.892
it's you, the players,
who make the game.

1:18:27.925 --> 1:18:29.994
Marie?

1:18:30.027 --> 1:18:33.898
Every step you take reveals
a new part of the world.

1:18:33.931 --> 1:18:35.699
Parts we make at Playfield

1:18:35.733 --> 1:18:38.869
and parts you and
all the other players make.

1:18:38.903 --> 1:18:40.938
Every player that joins
helps you see even more

1:18:40.971 --> 1:18:43.908
and adds their own unique
touches to the game.

1:18:43.941 --> 1:18:45.242
Our game is like life.

1:18:45.276 --> 1:18:48.445
You can choose to
brainstorm alone or...

1:18:50.114 --> 1:18:52.116
Oh! Um...

1:18:52.149 --> 1:18:54.885
or have more fun
and make a better game

1:18:54.919 --> 1:18:56.854
working with your friends
and your family.

1:18:56.887 --> 1:19:00.157
Yeah, the more you play
together in the world

1:19:00.191 --> 1:19:02.393
and explore,
the more you can change it.

1:19:04.094 --> 1:19:05.296

1:19:08.098 --> 1:19:09.433

Uh, Troy, anything
you'd like to say?

1:19:35.560 --> 1:19:37.194
That's like
over 50,000 already!

1:19:39.230 --> 1:19:41.466
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!

1:19:46.103 --> 1:19:48.005
<i>The online results are in</i>

1:19:48.038 --> 1:19:50.475
and the best new game demo is...

1:19:50.508 --> 1:19:53.010
Playfield Games' Brainstorm!

1:20:10.227 --> 1:20:13.330
Playfield Games rules!

1:20:19.136 --> 1:20:21.305
Ow! Ow!

1:20:23.140 --> 1:20:24.408
Playfield rules!

1:20:24.441 --> 1:20:26.443
Playfield rules!

1:20:26.478 --> 1:20:28.846
Playfield rules!

1:20:28.879 --> 1:20:30.515
Playfield rules!

1:20:30.548 --> 1:20:32.249
Playfield rules!

1:20:41.959 --> 1:20:45.262
This has been
a pretty good day.

1:20:45.296 --> 1:20:47.865
This has been a great day.

1:20:51.168 --> 1:20:53.270
I only wish your father
could be here to see it.

1:21:00.545 --> 1:21:01.845
He is.

1:21:16.994 --> 1:21:19.897
Hey.

1:21:19.930 --> 1:21:21.298
Daddy, this game is awesome!

1:21:23.468 --> 1:21:25.470
You made this?

1:21:25.503 --> 1:21:28.038
Well, together, we all did.

1:21:28.072 --> 1:21:29.273
Really?

1:21:29.306 --> 1:21:30.608
Hmm.

1:21:35.212 --> 1:21:36.246
Good stuff.

1:21:36.280 --> 1:21:37.649
Hey, Dad?

1:21:37.682 --> 1:21:38.717
Yeah?

1:21:38.750 --> 1:21:40.384
Want to get dinner later,
just the three of us?

1:21:42.152 --> 1:21:44.456
Yeah, okay.
You're buying.

1:21:44.489 --> 1:21:45.889
Okay.

1:21:45.923 --> 1:21:47.324
And I want
one of those T-shirts.

1:21:52.029 --> 1:21:52.963
Hey, you did it!

1:21:54.398 --> 1:21:57.635
You did it.
You did all of this.

1:21:57.669 --> 1:21:59.103
You're amazing.

1:21:59.136 --> 1:22:01.205
We did. We're amazing.

1:22:03.941 --> 1:22:05.876
This all just kinda
feels like a good dream.

1:22:08.278 --> 1:22:10.047
It's not a dream.

1:22:13.050 --> 1:22:15.553
Whoo-hoo!
Troy Aikman, MVP!

1:22:17.020 --> 1:22:17.955
Ah, Jimmy?

1:22:19.624 --> 1:22:20.658
Oh...

1:22:22.460 --> 1:22:27.499
Okay... right... um...

1:22:27.532 --> 1:22:28.600
First base.

1:22:34.071 --> 1:22:35.272
<i>Playfield is back.</i>

1:22:35.305 --> 1:22:36.508
<i>Honestly,
the graphics, the story...</i>

1:22:36.541 --> 1:22:39.611
<i>Literally
have never been more excited</i>

1:22:39.644 --> 1:22:40.512
<i>about a game release
in my life...</i>

1:22:40.545 --> 1:22:41.513
<i>Sometimes a game comes along</i>

1:22:41.546 --> 1:22:43.947
<i>that you have just no idea
what to expect</i>

1:22:43.981 --> 1:22:44.816
<i>and that's what this game is...</i>

1:22:44.849 --> 1:22:46.551
<i>Pre-order, sign me up!</i>

1:22:48.986 --> 1:22:51.054
So, how's the Brainstorm
sequel coming?

1:22:51.088 --> 1:22:52.590
Dude, you're gonna freak.

1:22:52.624 --> 1:22:53.991
Hey, you gonna
film this session?

1:22:54.024 --> 1:22:55.392
- It might be pretty good.
- Hi, Nick.

1:22:56.694 --> 1:22:58.530
Am I gonna film?

1:22:58.563 --> 1:23:00.964
Dude, afterschool coding
is my most popular content!

1:23:00.998 --> 1:23:02.166
Right?

1:23:02.199 --> 1:23:03.735
Hey, what's up, man?

1:23:03.768 --> 1:23:06.970
Put this on.
Yeah. Like it?

1:23:07.004 --> 1:23:08.272
Yeah. Look at that.
You look good, man.

1:23:08.305 --> 1:23:09.306
All right.

1:23:13.010 --> 1:23:15.045
Hello, Nicknames!

1:23:15.078 --> 1:23:17.448
Welcome to another episode
of back to school coding

1:23:17.482 --> 1:23:20.017
with the man himself,
Troy Mayfield.

1:23:20.050 --> 1:23:22.754
- All right, hello, everyone.
- New merch just dropped...

1:23:22.787 --> 1:23:23.688
- just check it out when you can.
- Today, I want to show you

1:23:23.721 --> 1:23:25.389
something we just installed
at Playfield

1:23:25.422 --> 1:23:27.057
- Link down below.
- ...that I like to call

1:23:27.090 --> 1:23:28.091
Team Dreamer.

1:23:28.125 --> 1:23:31.228
It is a group module
that requires every person

1:23:31.261 --> 1:23:33.263
to write at least
one line of code

1:23:33.297 --> 1:23:35.600
so everyone is contributing
to the game.

1:23:40.270 --> 1:23:41.338
What are you guys looking at?

1:23:49.547 --> 1:23:52.684
Whoa, this is...

1:23:52.717 --> 1:23:55.185
Dude, these graphics
are insane.

1:24:00.592 --> 1:24:04.729
Emily?
Wh-What are you doing here?

1:24:04.762 --> 1:24:06.396
My dad said
I might be able to

1:24:06.430 --> 1:24:08.232
learn something from you.

1:24:09.667 --> 1:24:10.568
Okay.

1:24:10.602 --> 1:24:12.804
Um, did you make this game
all by yourself?

1:24:12.837 --> 1:24:15.072
It's not quite finished yet.

1:24:15.874 --> 1:24:18.676
Dude, this could be
Brainstorm good.

1:24:18.710 --> 1:24:20.444
She might be better than you...

1:24:20.478 --> 1:24:23.113
Well everyone, let's load
Emily's game into Team Dreamer

1:24:23.146 --> 1:24:24.147
and see what happens.

1:24:33.357 --> 1:24:35.125
Emily,
wh-why don't you let us in?

1:24:35.158 --> 1:24:36.461
I don't need any help.

1:24:42.700 --> 1:24:44.234
Hey, Em...

1:24:46.236 --> 1:24:49.474
You know,
the more you open these,

1:24:49.507 --> 1:24:51.375
the better you can make this.

1:24:56.113 --> 1:24:57.114
Trust me?

1:25:02.252 --> 1:25:04.822
All right.
Have at it, everyone.

1:25:04.856 --> 1:25:06.290
Let's see what
we can do together.

1:25:08.158 --> 1:25:10.260
<i>My dad wrote in his binder,</i>

1:25:10.294 --> 1:25:12.764
<i>"Never skip the cut scenes.</i>

1:25:12.797 --> 1:25:15.533
<i>Complete all the quests.</i>

1:25:15.567 --> 1:25:19.169
<i>And play multi-player
every chance you get."</i>

1:25:21.472 --> 1:25:23.775
<i>Oh, and if you really
want to beat the game,</i>

1:25:23.808 --> 1:25:26.276
<i>always show the bad guy
who's boss.</i>

1:25:32.349 --> 1:25:34.318
Second place.

1:25:34.351 --> 1:25:35.486
More like first loser.

1:25:43.928 --> 1:25:45.262
Mayfield?

1:25:45.295 --> 1:25:46.631
What the hell
does this kid want?

1:25:47.799 --> 1:25:49.901
"Which Hogwarts house are you?"

1:25:49.934 --> 1:25:51.536
Well, that's a good question.

1:25:51.569 --> 1:25:52.537
Huh?

1:25:53.671 --> 1:25:55.673
Yeah.

1:26:01.546 --> 1:26:02.547
Hufflepuff?

1:26:02.580 --> 1:26:03.681
There's no way.

1:26:03.715 --> 1:26:04.649
Uh, what?

1:26:05.817 --> 1:26:06.784
What happened?

1:26:06.818 --> 1:26:10.187
The computers are fried.
Who the hell did this?

1:26:10.220 --> 1:26:11.589
